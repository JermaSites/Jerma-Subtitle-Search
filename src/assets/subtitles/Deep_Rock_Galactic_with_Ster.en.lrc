[00:01.00]Hey, how's everybody doing?
[00:05.38]Early today.
[00:06.68]Very early.
[00:08.54]I wasn't anticipating being this early, but... Sometimes things happen and you have to solve them.
[00:18.13]Otto has an appointment today.
[00:22.02]He has some, like...
[00:24.47]Kind of weird skin itching issues.
[00:27.65]And it's getting to the point where... It's been like a couple days and I really... I gotta get him in to get seen.
[00:33.09]So... He's okay.
[00:34.67]He's fine.
[00:35.41]There's nothing wrong with him.
[00:36.45]He's just... I don't know if it's the dry Vegas air or something.
[00:40.05]Or the Vegas weather or something.
[00:41.31]But he needs to... I gotta get him checked out.
[00:43.79]So... Gonna start early.
[00:46.97]Stream for about five hours or so.
[00:48.51]Me and Star are gonna play Deep Rock Galactic.
[00:52.94]It is a Left 4 Dead Minecraft game.
[00:55.88]That's right.
[00:58.32]I don't know what this game actually is.
[00:59.56]I did the tutorial and we're in a lobby together right now.
[01:03.16]Etalyx may join us in like an hour or so.
[01:07.43]And we'll go for about four or five hours.
[01:09.71]And then I gotta take Otto to the vet.
[01:11.03]And then tomorrow we're gonna do the movies.
[01:14.09]So you'll see the movies tomorrow.
[01:15.95]Hopefully with some mods installed.
[01:20.29]And that's the plan.
[01:24.52]So let me see if he's here.
[01:28.94]You there?
[01:29.22]I'm not sure if he's around yet.
[01:34.05]Hey.
[01:43.83]I really don't want to raise my voice.
[01:45.51]I will if I have to.
[01:48.17]I think he's got me muted.
[01:56.49]Let me move this out of the way.
[01:57.69]Okay.
[02:03.17]Hey, look!
[02:04.59]So this is, uh, Deep Rock Galactic.
[02:06.55]This is the... ...uh, lobby system.
[02:12.82]And there is, um... Let's see if we can get his attention.
[02:25.03]How do I get his attention?
[02:39.58]Did I just spit on him?
[02:45.30]Oh, hello?
[02:46.42]Are you there?
[02:48.38]Yeah, I'm here.
[02:49.06]Hey, sorry.
[02:49.52]I was trying to get your attention.
[02:52.14]Oh, I accidentally had to turn down...
[02:55.91]Well, that was kind of funny.
[03:00.39]So what's the... Where do we go?
[03:02.85]What's the plan?
[03:04.10]I think you might be lagging a little.
[03:07.46]Yeah, I'm lagging.
[03:08.26]You go to the mission terminal.
[03:13.52]Yeah.
[03:15.80]And you select the mission.
[03:17.50]Well, you're the party leader, so I think you should do it first.
[03:22.94]Because I really don't... I don't know where to go.
[03:26.13]I mean, either I haven't played in a while.
[03:28.71]Yeah, um.
[03:31.63]What's that?
[03:32.27]That looks like a looks like my old intro up there.
[03:36.81]Time to get to work team.
[03:38.98]That's pretty funny.
[03:40.18]Yeah, it's like.
[03:41.80]Kind of funny.
[03:44.46]Yeah.
[03:45.94]What so what?
[03:46.58]What's the first mission will be?
[03:48.72]Could you please hurry up countdown?
[03:50.60]I'm coming.
[03:52.45]We're doing a drop.
[03:53.83]Do you have to strap in?
[03:54.87]Yeah, you gotta strap in.
[03:56.83]Remember seatbelt.
[03:59.51]He reminds you.
[04:08.96]Pretty good game so far.
[04:14.17]Sorry, I wasn't fancy.
[04:15.05]What did you say?
[04:16.55]I was just having, you know... Sorry.
[04:18.73]No, you talk first.
[04:20.06]I... I talked, what?
[04:20.72]Oh wait, no, sorry.
[04:25.50]I thought I was talking over you.
[04:28.34]Alright, so I'm playing as the... I'm playing as the... What is this, the driller?
[04:35.00]How do I get my drill out?
[04:37.70]and you try your your one or your two or your three or your four so I can't explain how this game works because I I can't really do that good of a job explaining it so you can do it um listen to him you go down through the tunnels you find the resources we need so we got to extract 200 more kite you got to collect 10 fossils that's a
[05:03.86]That's what we got to do.
[05:04.52]And then you got to come run all the way back up to this spot before the ship leaves.
[05:09.58]Alright.
[05:09.82]Nice.
[05:13.21]And I'm the light guy.
[05:14.17]Also, there's fall damage and you don't want to you don't want to take that.
[05:23.13]And usually in the starting area, you know, you got a couple of things to mine.
[05:26.02]That's our bot.
[05:26.72]You got to put the minerals in the bot.
[05:28.60]You know, not that pretty good.
[05:49.60]You know, you're gonna get outrun Elvie!
[05:51.10]You're gonna get outrun Elvie!
[05:52.14]Come on!
[05:52.80]It's Gerber and Starr again!
[05:54.00]Let's go!
[05:54.42]That didn't last long.
[06:01.91]I can't, I can't do that.
[06:03.07]I can't.
[06:05.37]I can't.
[06:05.77]I'm sorry, that's not gonna happen.
[06:07.95]We agreed to try and sound as boring as possible and see how long we could do it.
[06:12.07]But there was a cliff.
[06:15.49]Hey, hey, hey, turn around.
[06:16.33]Tutorial.
[06:17.41]I don't even know how to play the game!
[06:20.37]I'm teaching you!
[06:21.15]This is the fossil.
[06:22.86]That's the fossil.
[06:23.52]We need 10 of those.
[06:24.90]Why don't I get my little bot?
[06:27.24]Oh, I have to do it.
[06:28.40]We don't have the bot.
[06:29.20]The bot is single player only, so it's up to us.
[06:32.52]Oh, okay.
[06:33.70]It's up to us.
[06:34.56]Well, I've got a flamethrower.
[06:35.50]That's pretty cool.
[06:36.14]How do I get my... Ooh, I've got my drill arms.
[06:39.12]How do I... Okay, I'm actually not trying to fall on purpose.
[06:43.20]What's my travel ability?
[06:45.76]um I don't think the drill guy has one wait I well you can you ever play red faction yeah that's what we're talking about you just drill up and down oh okay that's somewhere if we had more people like if we had any friends whatsoever if I didn't like break all ties with everybody and we would have other people be able to join us then there's like a zip line guy
[07:13.02]Yeah, it's just too bad you've burnt every bridge you've ever had in your life.
[07:17.08]Like, we would maybe have some friends.
[07:17.98]Thanks for playing with me, by the way.
[07:19.56]That over there, that's health.
[07:21.36]So if you're ever hurt and you need health, that's what health is.
[07:24.48]Okay.
[07:25.62]So I need that now.
[07:26.50]Alright, I'm not... Can I be honest with you for a second?
[07:31.65]That, like, wicked loud fake laugh that I did, like, I hurt myself.
[07:38.11]I... Wait, what was that?
[07:41.42]I have you.
[07:42.81]I've captured you.
[07:43.99]I thought that was you doing that.
[07:45.93]No, that would have been a very good impression.
[07:48.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:49.29]What do you mean you... Why do you have me doing that?
[07:52.08]Well, see, I'm a soul taker now.
[07:53.62]That's what I do whenever I play with people.
[07:55.48]I take their souls through voice clips.
[08:07.55]That's not going to get old.
[08:09.81]No way.
[08:10.35]Alright, let's get this.
[08:12.53]It doesn't.
[08:14.15]I wish I could just play that.
[08:15.67]I thought you were playing back a clip of you laughing.
[08:18.94]Oh, no, no.
[08:24.76]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[08:25.46]Don't use your drill on those.
[08:26.78]You just hold down space.
[08:28.69]Hold on space?
[08:30.71]Oh, shit.
[08:31.25]No, nobody's a weirdo like you that has, like, fucking space bars and melee.
[08:35.13]Hey, watch out for the crystals!
[08:36.33]What?
[08:36.51]They shoot lightning.
[08:39.13]Don't hit them.
[08:39.96]Don't?
[08:40.18]Are you serious?
[08:41.38]You just avoid these.
[08:42.74]Okay, I can avoid these.
[08:44.58]Don't look at them.
[08:45.04]Don't look, don't look, don't look.
[08:46.02]It's like the thing in Minecraft.
[08:47.62]You don't look at it.
[08:49.37]Otherwise it comes for you.
[08:51.43]I'm still freaking out by the fact that you have this strange robot device that can capture me.
[08:59.95]That's not going to get old.
[09:03.81]That's not me saying that.
[09:04.73]I didn't say that he had... You know what?
[09:08.47]Can I just say a couple of things and I'll just play and you can just do a commentary as me.
[09:13.15]Okay, okay.
[09:13.75]Give me the... I need them separately.
[09:16.47]Give me an affirmative, like a yes.
[09:19.26]you got it okay now give me a negative nope uh you're not too sure anymore well I don't get it and um I don't know anything you want dude over here okay that one is amazing you can use that one at any time and hold on I got the super light gun oh wait wrong wrong one

[09:52.82]Bugs!
[09:52.98]Do you see these bugs?
[09:55.04]Do you see these bugs?
[10:01.96]I do.
[10:02.32]I don't get it.
[10:07.76]Be careful.
[10:08.78]Oh, I forget what the button is, but the button to call the...
[10:14.56]over to you is pretty important also this nitrate very important we're gonna need it I I I I'm sorry I cannot pay attention right now you're a little bit distracted I'm still freaking out you've just been waiting for an opportunity to use this
[10:37.48]I love how the, hey, let's be quiet and not, like, make any references or any jokes at all the entire stream lasted five minutes.
[10:44.32]And now the, I'm gonna make Jerva say fucking crazy shit over himself is now the new thing.
[10:53.78]So what, okay, we need to extract more kite.
[10:56.61]More kite, yeah, that's what we're looking for.
[10:57.89]It's the light blue.
[11:01.15]Not those.
[11:02.35]Should I keep throwing out these, um... Yeah.
[11:04.95]These...
[11:06.43]You have a whole bunch of them, and we're going to need to come back later.
[11:09.19]I don't know.
[11:10.33]They stay on the ground forever.
[11:12.01]Wait, I got this.
[11:12.63]Even when they turn off.
[11:13.85]So you can follow where you've been.
[11:17.17]Should I be going up or down?
[11:18.29]Drill it, baby.
[11:19.65]Up or down?
[11:23.23]You got it.
[11:25.03]Oh, I thought I just said that.
[11:27.70]I didn't say that.
[11:28.40]You thought that you said that, but you didn't say that.
[11:30.24]Yes, I thought I just said that, but I didn't.
[11:32.20]I just heard myself say that.
[11:33.16]Which way do we go?
[11:33.88]Up or down?
[11:35.17]We go, uh, we go straight.
[11:41.13]Okay.
[11:43.41]Watch out, there's bugs behind you.
[11:45.61]What about this, uh, egg sack?
[11:50.19]Try to torch the egg sacks?
[11:51.24]Um, watch out.
[11:52.28]I don't know what these are, actually.
[11:59.76]So, are there difficulties?
[12:00.66]What about the slugs?
[12:03.96]I thought that was me as well.
[12:05.72]I thought that your character yelling that was me.
[12:08.22]You're freaking me out.
[12:09.46]No, that's not you.
[12:13.29]Okay.
[12:14.21]That's not you.
[12:15.15]Okay, I think.
[12:17.83]I thought you like pitch shifted me screaming something.
[12:21.29]Do I have any minerals?
[12:22.19]Yeah, I have some.
[12:23.39]Where do I see my mineral count?
[12:24.53]I just went through the ground.
[12:27.17]Where's my mineral count?
[12:29.55]At the bottom of your screen.
[12:30.75]If you've picked up anything.
[12:32.29]You gotta dump it in there.
[12:34.41]I don't have anything.
[12:35.43]Okay, you have nothing.
[12:36.27]Okay, we're good.
[12:37.70]Okay, so, uh... Up or down?
[12:39.54]Up or down?
[12:41.66]Straight.
[12:42.48]Down.
[12:42.70]Okay.
[12:44.76]This is more kite.
[12:50.27]Oh, here we go.
[12:50.77]So, should I not be control clicking on this at all?
[12:57.03]We got swarm incoming.
[12:58.55]Incoming swarm.
[12:59.15]You got it.
[13:00.39]No, why am I saying you got it?
[13:01.57]That's like the fake me saying that.
[13:03.97]Dude.
[13:04.81]Over here.
[13:10.32]So is there something I should be doing?
[13:12.86]We're just holding in a corner here.
[13:14.58]You know how Left 4 Dead, the zombies all rush you?
[13:17.06]We're getting ready.
[13:17.86]We're bracing for impact.
[13:21.84]What are my grenades?
[13:22.28]I don't know.
[13:27.63]I don't know.
[13:28.25]I don't know.
[13:28.53]I don't know.
[13:30.25]You're gonna have to throw one.
[13:34.85]Somebody clip that.
[13:35.51]Somebody clip him saying that right now.
[13:37.17]I gotta do my own version of it.
[13:38.47]Somebody clip him saying that and give it to me.
[13:43.78]Wait, which way?
[13:44.50]You got it.
[13:45.38]You got it.
[13:53.17]Up or down?
[13:57.70]I don't know.
[13:59.96]This is not a really big swarm.
[14:01.46]This is like three.
[14:03.74]Up or down?
[14:04.62]Up or down?
[14:06.74]I don't know.
[14:10.46]Is it friendly fire?
[14:11.18]Uh, yes, I think.
[14:13.56]It depends on difficulty.
[14:14.61]We're just doing like a simple mission right now.
[14:16.51]You know, just to get our bearings.
[14:18.49]Oh, now we got bugs.
[14:23.49]My grenades are like a slow field.
[14:25.53]Let's see what mine do.
[14:28.89]I think you might have the TNT explosion.
[14:32.19]That's not exploding.
[14:33.55]It's an axe.
[14:34.33]Oh, you have an axe.
[14:36.05]Well, they just had an update as well to what grenades do.
[14:41.01]Pretty sick.
[14:49.61]Out of ammo.
[14:50.87]Click that, dickhead.
[14:53.19]That was really mean.
[14:54.21]It was like rude.
[14:56.13]I wasn't sure if that was you saying that or me making you say that.
[14:59.02]What do we do about this?
[15:03.84]It's like roly-poly.
[15:09.52]What the hell?
[15:10.85]I have no idea.
[15:11.29]I've never seen it before.
[15:13.03]This thing's huge.
[15:14.59]Get it right in his teeth.
[15:22.96]It kind of is a brain bug.
[15:25.82]You got it.
[15:32.68]Um, this is... Okay.
[15:35.05]They probably warned us about this at some point, like, 50 years ago.
[15:39.97]Right now, I'm, like, laughing at not me.
[15:42.91]I'm laughing at myself.
[15:44.39]But it's not even me, but it was me earlier.
[15:46.37]I'm gonna die.
[15:47.53]No, I'm not.
[15:51.98]It's, it's, it's... How are you, how are you doing that?
[15:54.65]What?
[15:55.87]I, I dug into the wall so I could stand in it.
[15:57.83]I thought you said I could drill up.
[16:02.61]Whoa!
[16:03.35]Okay, that... That was fucking scary.
[16:10.95]Well, you got, you got to drill like a... That was really scary.
[16:15.08]Diagonal up.
[16:16.94]I, I mean, I was, I thought I was doing that.
[16:19.12]Oh, wait, like worms.
[16:19.94]Fossils, fossils, fossils.
[16:21.99]We got fossils.
[16:28.68]So let me test this out.
[16:29.44]So you're talking about like worms.
[16:31.50]So if I go like this.
[16:32.90]Watch out behind you!
[16:33.44]I got it.
[16:38.51]Yeah, you can just keep going.
[16:39.41]Oh, you can make like, it's cool.
[16:42.33]Um, I forgot the button.
[16:43.67]Hey, hey.
[16:45.07]Anybody here from Twitch chat?
[16:46.71]I need the mule right here.
[16:48.19]How do I?
[16:48.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[16:49.31]I gotta check the button.
[16:53.30]What do you need?
[16:54.98]We need to call in a supply drop for more ammo.
[17:01.21]I forgot the button.
[17:02.35]Five.
[17:03.29]How do I know that and you don't?
[17:04.67]Yeah, how do you know that?
[17:05.43]Because you just did the tutorial.
[17:07.77]I can do it.
[17:08.93]Should I do it too?
[17:10.29]No.
[17:11.03]Only one of us can do it.
[17:16.82]This is ammo, I'm assuming.
[17:19.08]And you need nitrous for this.
[17:20.42]Or whatever it is.
[17:23.88]Okay, that scared me too.
[17:26.60]And I knew it was coming.
[17:35.52]Should I just take them each side?
[17:37.43]No, leave those.
[17:39.61]Leave them.
[17:39.97]We need to collect the... You see this red mineral up here?
[17:43.63]The red one?
[17:44.93]Yeah, that's what allows us to call that supply drop-in, so we don't just have them forever.
[17:49.44]So you're talking about that, the thing I'm pointing at?
[17:51.30]The one that I'm mining right now.
[17:52.42]Red sugar?
[17:53.71]Yeah, you need, like, 90 or 80 of these.
[17:55.51]Okay.
[17:56.87]Well, you can, like, fly around.
[17:58.13]I have to, like, walk.
[17:59.87]I have to, like, drill through the sky.
[18:07.15]Well, I'm sorry you picked the driller.
[18:11.15]Well, that's your... You collect, then.
[18:13.31]I'll just be the guy that, like, hangs out.
[18:16.10]Just watches me play the game?
[18:17.14]I'll just watch you play the game.
[18:18.56]Yeah.
[18:18.90]Okay, well, where are we going?
[18:20.18]We're going up.
[18:22.81]It's straight.
[18:24.81]We're going this way.
[18:27.23]Okay.
[18:27.47]Isn't there a map?
[18:33.61]Oh, there's a war over here.
[18:35.15]There's a tab.
[18:36.83]Behind you, dude.
[18:38.23]Yeah, but you can handle it.
[18:41.51]I don't know.
[18:43.73]Can I?
[18:45.75]Yeah, you can handle it.
[18:46.51]Look.
[18:48.51]We almost got... What do we need?
[18:49.79]200?
[18:52.35]Yeah.
[18:58.26]So what about other minerals?
[18:59.92]Are there rare minerals?
[19:01.86]Like, holy shit, I see gold or something.
[19:04.48]There are.
[19:05.84]If you see a whole bunch of circles in a wall, kind of like this, actually.
[19:09.57]You see this over here?
[19:10.45]You see what's going on?
[19:11.91]Up there?
[19:12.17]So should I drill in there?
[19:14.35]Yeah, that means...
[19:16.31]I'm pretty sure that's one of them it looks a little different usually inside the wall here this is where you need drill guy to go in there and drill up into that wall monster uh monster spawner in there oh there's uh there's pearls okay I see more I see more yeah just keep digging into the the circle spot okay until you find the pearl until I find the pearl uh now come back it's like it's like over here

[20:22.97]I don't know.
[20:26.39]Nope.
[20:27.39]That's all I've got.
[20:28.65]Nope.
[20:30.67]You don't have a yes or don't you have a dude come here?
[20:34.37]I have a... Up or down?
[20:37.15]Down.
[20:37.47]Up or down?
[20:40.35]Down.
[20:41.35]It's right in front of me.
[20:42.05]How do I get it?
[20:42.91]Oh.
[20:43.57]Oh.
[20:43.93]Well then, um...
[20:46.58]I don't get it.
[20:48.24]I got it.
[20:49.76]Oh, now we gotta bring it back to the mule.
[20:53.22]You got it.
[20:53.98]Where's the mule from here?
[20:56.00]Can I just throw it?
[20:57.02]That shouldn't be funny.
[20:59.16]Straight down.
[21:03.59]Just go for it.
[21:07.89]Did I just give you the EXP?
[21:10.07]Yeah, I got all the experience from that.
[21:12.19]No, you didn't.
[21:12.53]You're not gonna level ever.
[21:15.13]I don't know.
[21:18.75]The thing is, people know the truth, because I come through clean and crisp, and that comes through, like, not clean and crisp.
[21:28.95]Alright, so I'm looking at the map right now.
[21:31.29]These are rare materials, too.
[21:33.06]Are they?
[21:33.82]Buys more.
[21:35.34]Buys more?
[21:41.84]Yeah.
[21:42.52]Oh, that's cool.
[21:43.06]0.1 buys more.
[21:47.49]Yeah, you're going to need more than that.
[21:49.25]That's to fuel satellites.
[21:51.63]And then the satellites, you can call them down.
[21:57.80]Oh, that's cool.
[21:58.68]Alright, so where should we go from here?
[22:01.22]Let's open up a map that I knew about, but you didn't.
[22:08.81]We can go up.
[22:14.13]Up or down?
[22:16.76]Up.
[22:16.94]Well, where are you?
[22:19.89]Well, I'm... There's a loot bug over here.
[22:21.81]Is that, like, a... Whoa, what... Oh, yeah, kill loot bugs.
[22:25.51]Ooh.
[22:27.77]Where's my friend?
[22:29.27]I'm down.
[22:30.89]How can I, like, tell you where I am?
[22:32.69]I'm, like, underneath you.
[22:33.41]I think there's a yell button.
[22:35.33]Oh, there you are, yeah.
[22:37.45]Okay, come.
[22:41.13]Yeah, let's go, like, up.
[22:43.33]Not down.
[22:44.89]Up.
[22:48.43]I don't know.
[22:48.87]I can't remember which one this is.
[22:51.51]I don't know.
[22:53.21]But now I'm so confused.
[22:56.61]That's not going to get old.
[23:00.65]Oh, what's this?
[23:02.95]Gold.
[23:03.31]It's gold.
[23:03.99]We need gold.
[23:08.11]This is very annoying without anyone that can go up walls.
[23:11.76]What's this?
[23:16.66]I mean, I think you're the only person that can get that.
[23:18.42]Oh yeah, don't worry, I've got it.
[23:23.24]So should I, are you collecting it, or should I go on the ground and collect it?
[23:26.52]I'm collecting.
[23:27.53]Okay, good.
[23:30.31]What does that, um, what does that really cool, uh, new cyberpunk trailer music mean?
[23:39.64]Uh, swarm.
[23:41.88]Oh.
[23:50.06]I do like the flame effects though, they're very cool.
[23:58.55]How difficult is it for you to press that button?
[24:02.64]Uh, I do have to take my hand off my mouse for a second.
[24:05.80]See?
[24:06.34]You should be focusing on the game.
[24:07.94]Instead of your... How do you not have when I screamed clipped already?
[24:14.08]You still got these old, old material... Well, see, because to record it, I have to, like, keep my hand over there.
[24:20.26]There's a huge bug.
[24:21.04]There's a huge bug.
[24:22.46]Gaping Dragon over here.
[24:26.77]I'll be... Yeah.
[24:27.43]Yeah.
[24:27.89]Yeah.
[24:31.40]Where'd he go?
[24:43.13]Ow.
[24:43.37]There he is.
[24:43.63]There he is.
[24:44.29]Behind you.
[24:48.11]This hurts.
[24:48.57]I don't know.
[24:51.45]I really don't know.
[24:52.17]I'm going to delete them all because I don't remember which one is which.
[24:55.66]There he is.
[24:56.22]There he is.
[24:59.83]Yeah, keep that one, because there he is.
[25:01.61]There he is, there he is.
[25:02.39]There he is, there he is.
[25:04.73]There he is, there he is.
[25:05.89]There he is, there he is.
[25:08.35]I don't know.
[25:12.07]Oh shit, that guy almost just insta-killed him.
[25:17.49]I don't see him.
[25:18.03]There he is, there he is.
[25:19.15]Are you sure?
[25:19.57]There he is, there he is.
[25:21.67]Okay, I'm going down.
[25:23.10]Fine.
[25:25.02]Fine.
[25:28.90]Fine.
[25:32.30]Does he drop anything or no?
[25:34.44]Uh, no.
[25:34.64]Or is he just cool?
[25:36.90]He's just a cool guy.
[25:37.86]Just cool.
[25:38.36]Alright.
[25:38.92]Uh, I need some of that, uh, that red sugar.
[25:41.82]To heal, right?
[25:43.54]Yeah.
[25:44.36]What is it?
[25:44.60]What is it?
[25:44.86]It's kryptonite or something?
[25:45.66]What's it called?
[25:47.02]It's, um... I don't know.
[25:51.75]Let's go up.
[25:53.67]Is it, like, procedurally everything generated?
[25:56.45]Well, do you have the map?
[25:57.37]What was the map button?
[25:58.93]Tab.
[25:59.31]Hold tab.
[25:59.59]Oh, it's tab.
[26:02.93]Well, yeah, if there was something up there, you'd be able to see it on the map.
[26:05.03]But yeah, you can just like drill across.
[26:07.70]Or do you want me to just go in here and just drill?
[26:10.12]I'm going to just go.
[26:14.58]Is this like Minecraft?
[26:16.06]Should I not like ever drill what I don't know where I'm drilling?
[26:18.20]Are we going to fall into lava?
[26:19.88]There's no like bedrock or like lava or anything.
[26:22.88]Alright, well, we're just still going.
[26:27.63]OK.
[26:30.49]I don't think you're going anywhere.
[26:32.81]Am I not going anywhere?
[26:37.83]You gotta look at the map.
[26:39.25]No, like, look at where you are.
[26:40.47]Like, hold path.
[26:44.14]Yeah?
[26:45.00]What about it?
[26:47.08]This is not... I... Like, if you rotated the map, you'd be able to see a room.
[26:56.02]But so what?
[26:56.44]Am I not going anywhere?
[26:59.71]So can I not... Am I not going anywhere?
[27:03.05]But why can I dig over here, though?
[27:05.69]Why not?
[27:06.83]Well, what's... There's no secrets over here?
[27:12.46]You know, you're the hardest person to record soundbites for because, like, it doesn't start recording until you start talking, but you have, like... Most of the things you say are filler words.
[27:24.67]Well, what's... There's no secrets over here?
[27:29.85]Like, most people I can just get a straight, like, there's no secrets over here?
[27:33.75]Not you.
[27:37.80]Oh, big bug.
[27:42.08]There's no secrets over here?
[27:46.08]Oh, what did we do?
[27:47.81]Oh, that is a big bug.
[27:52.23]Yeah, shoot them in the butt.
[27:54.47]Ah, he dropped something.
[27:57.29]Am I not supposed to be touching that?
[27:59.34]No, that's poison.
[28:01.08]But no, there actually is like a globe in there.
[28:03.99]Wait, come back this way.
[28:06.59]We gotta keep drilling.
[28:08.39]I thought you just told me that this was not something I should be doing.
[28:12.99]Don't... you wanna see what's that way?
[28:16.24]Wasn't the whole point that I was stupid for doing this?
[28:21.70]Yeah.
[28:27.08]Am I not going anywhere?
[28:33.25]Well, wha- what's- wha- there's no secrets over here?
[28:43.05]Am I not going anywhere?
[28:44.01]I don't understand.
[28:49.36]Well, wha- what's- wha- there's no secrets over here?
[28:52.12]Uh, he dropped something.
[29:07.48]Hold on, look at the map.
[29:09.68]Am I not going anywhere?
[29:10.58]Hold on.
[29:13.26]Should we turn around, right?
[29:14.06]Is this not it?
[29:14.56]Turn around, right?
[29:15.04]You can just do that for fun.
[29:33.28]no this is serious business just wait till they patch that out next patch we found an exploit this just in miners can mine in ground we've removed it we think players had too much freedom alright so you went down yeah up or down alright yeah we gotta go this we haven't gone this way alright cool
[30:02.31]Our first mission, and we get just like an actual one.
[30:05.85]There's health over here.
[30:10.98]Health globes?
[30:17.72]Hey, I got some.
[30:19.00]175 out of 200.
[30:19.60]I'm just gonna keep going up.
[30:27.30]So who's the best character in the game?
[30:28.46]What's the coolest character?
[30:30.23]The coolest?
[30:31.21]I really do like Drill Guy.
[30:33.74]There's one fun thing.
[30:35.74]After you collect all the minerals, you have to retrace your steps to get back up to the starting spot.
[30:41.65]Right.
[30:42.51]Or trace your straps.
[30:44.25]But Drill Guy can just drill a straight line straight back to it.
[30:48.99]Especially if you're on a harder level because the levels get really huge.
[30:55.14]They seem like they could get big.
[30:57.76]You ever play this game called Apex Legends?
[31:00.38]No, not once.
[31:02.14]Okay, well, first of all, Apex Legends is better than this game.
[31:05.38]And there's the character Pathfinder, and he has, you know, ziplines.
[31:09.37]There's a zipline character just like that.
[31:12.13]Underneath you, there's health underneath you.
[31:14.99]Like, grab it.
[31:15.83]Right underneath, like, with that rocket.
[31:17.89]I'm not hurt.
[31:18.59]Straight below you.
[31:19.55]There's health underneath.
[31:22.42]Are you dead?
[31:24.18]What?
[31:24.38]No.
[31:26.50]Are you dead right now?
[31:27.44]Am I dead?
[31:28.62]No, why?
[31:29.92]I'm mining over here.
[31:32.48]You look like you're dead.
[31:35.73]Dead, like, what happens when you die?
[31:37.65]Can you be, like, revived or what?
[31:41.61]Well, no, you're just dead forever.
[31:43.89]What, do you see a dead body on the screen?
[31:46.76]Yeah, there's one, like, right down this pit.
[31:48.96]What?
[31:49.12]What?
[31:50.58]I'm like fucking over here mining this red shit.
[31:55.20]You don't see me over here.
[31:56.36]I'm pressing X. Do you see me hitting the red thing?
[31:59.52]I got you.
[32:01.12]What the fuck just happened?
[32:04.30]What the fuck's going on?
[32:05.80]Why am I here?
[32:06.54]Hey, there's health over here.
[32:08.86]You just like ported me back.
[32:10.47]Am I lagging?
[32:11.11]You just like ported me back.
[32:12.11]I was like in a fucking wall.
[32:17.07]Can you like teleport people to...
[32:20.54]that's weird yeah there's a I'm playing teleport guy oh no I just I got like pulled back that's weird I actually forget what the other guy does so we we need to find fossils we need to find fossils I think they actually show up on the scanner too do they
[32:45.13]Let me go this way.
[32:47.09]We've been messing around so much I have no clue where we've been and haven't been.
[32:50.69]And also, like, every 10 minutes my computer has been freaking out and it just starts, like, freezing up and I can't do anything about it.
[32:56.50]I'm sorry to hear that.
[33:02.44]I'm not very... I don't like this character.
[33:04.06]I want the character that can fly around.
[33:07.21]Whoa, I'm at crystals.
[33:12.71]Hey, there's a lot of bugs!
[33:14.83]I need your help!
[33:16.63]Where you at?
[33:19.21]I'm worried, Trevor.
[33:19.81]I think I'm going to die.
[33:20.77]Hit.
[33:20.99]Shout.
[33:21.57]Shout.
[33:21.91]Shout.
[33:22.23]Shout.
[33:22.65]I don't know where you are.
[33:23.67]Swarm.
[33:23.91]I repeat, swarm.
[33:28.19]What happens if they hit me?
[33:29.35]What?
[33:29.53]You see a dead body on screen?
[33:32.28]Shout again.
[33:32.80]I can't see you.
[33:33.18]I don't know where you are.
[33:34.64]Dead, like... What happens when you die?
[33:36.96]Can you be, like, revived or what?
[33:40.68]Dead, like...
[33:42.38]Shut up, Jerma.
[33:44.25]I'm fine.
[33:48.19]Watch out.
[33:48.89]I got this one.
[33:49.63]I got this.
[33:49.95]Watch out.
[33:51.73]Told you.
[33:58.36]What's the big circle here?
[33:59.22]The big blue circle.
[33:59.92]That's what I was talking about before.
[34:00.76]What is this?
[34:01.04]Oh, that's my grenade.
[34:02.54]That's a slow field.
[34:03.94]I can't see anything.
[34:05.58]Help me.
[34:13.33]I'm not gonna lie, I have no clue.
[34:15.08]Like... I would not lie to you.
[34:22.02]I mean, you have many times... I'm just gonna run around and gut the last fossil as we get the heck out of here.
[34:28.51]Yeah, well, you're the one that made this a comedy stream.
[34:30.55]This is supposed to be a boring Play the Game stream, and you made it a comedy stream by recording me without me telling you you could.
[34:38.66]I want to make sure you're aware of that.
[34:40.20]I didn't sign any release form.
[34:41.86]Tell me when I have permission to record you.
[34:45.16]Not now.
[34:47.20]You don't have permission to record me right now.
[34:49.88]Okay, I'm not.
[34:52.06]Okay, good.
[34:54.05]I would hate to have to get legal involved in this one.
[34:59.23]I have a drill.
[34:59.95]Why would I be doing this?
[35:05.13]I don't know.
[35:05.61]Have we probably walked by...
[35:08.93]A ton of these.
[35:09.91]There's gold up here?
[35:11.63]No, I just grabbed it.
[35:16.29]So we're looking for the fossil-looking thing, right?
[35:20.82]I'm out of ammo.
[35:21.40]I'm looking for the fossil-looking thing.
[35:26.04]Ow!
[35:26.90]Mike, I'm out of... Shit, sorry.
[35:29.04]I know we don't like to use real names.
[35:30.88]I'm out of ammo.
[35:34.29]Please never say that again.
[35:35.65]I would hate...
[35:37.38]I hate to have to get legal involved in this one.
[35:41.78]I need ammo.
[35:47.37]Was that a supply thing, or should I just drop another one?
[35:51.47]I don't know if we can.
[35:56.07]I don't see where it says.
[35:56.91]You need like 80 nitro.
[36:00.91]Is there something on the mini map or something that indicates if there's a fossil around?
[36:04.80]Or like the scanner or something?
[36:07.33]Because I'm just trying to find one too.
[36:08.33]I'm pretty sure.
[36:12.63]Oh, we're like nowhere near each other.
[36:13.91]No, I'm just looking for fossils.
[36:16.27]They have that weird Nautilus look to them, right?
[36:19.40]Yeah.
[36:20.50]It's like the Pokémon.
[36:22.78]The Pokémon.
[36:23.62]I don't... Are you excited for... Pokémon, Blood and Gore?
[36:29.66]Oh.
[36:30.32]See, mine was like nice.
[36:31.76]Yours was mean and horrible.
[36:33.65]Mean?
[36:34.90]Pokémon blood and gore.
[36:39.02]They're going with a more mature route.
[36:40.84]They figured after a detective Pikachu, like everyone who likes Pokémon is a bit older now and it's time for Pokémon blood and gore.
[36:49.76]Pokémon sex and drugs.
[36:52.52]That's next.
[36:53.04]They're testing the waters with blood and gore.
[36:56.66]I'm going up.
[36:58.46]Okay.
[36:58.76]I think I have all the fossils.
[37:00.66]It says we have six out of ten.
[37:03.86]Yeah, I'm carrying four.
[37:05.68]Oh, you have four.
[37:06.68]Okay.
[37:11.42]Can you shout for me?
[37:13.30]I'm so far away.
[37:14.84]Yeah, you are really far away.
[37:17.78]You can start heading back to the ship, because once I can deposit this, we're leaving.
[37:21.98]Oh.
[37:25.15]The ship is just the thing that looks like a ship on the screen, right?
[37:29.05]Yeah.
[37:31.63]I think.
[37:32.07]Why is it moving?
[37:33.67]Why is it moving?
[37:34.19]Oh, no, no, that's the mule.
[37:36.13]So where's the ship?
[37:38.38]I'm gonna, like, leave you on this planet.
[37:40.92]Don't do that!
[37:42.28]This is about to be really bad.
[37:44.60]But where is the ship from here?
[37:47.82]Um... Is it on the map?
[37:51.80]I think it's way up on the map.
[37:53.82]You just need to start going up.
[37:56.64]I think it'll show you once I complete the quest thingy.
[38:01.21]But normally you're meant to follow...
[38:04.58]The mule.
[38:05.26]Alright, well, um, I'm just gonna dig.
[38:07.50]I'm digging straight up.
[38:08.44]Hopefully I don't drown myself.
[38:14.52]Mule has a button.
[38:16.32]Somebody said the mule has a button.
[38:18.44]Yeah, it has a button that I press and then, like, the mission ends and swarms all come after you.
[38:22.56]Oh, okay.
[38:23.04]And you have to get to the exit.
[38:26.48]Because the bugs know that you're leaving and they're, like, lonely.
[38:34.26]I'm just making this harder.
[38:35.28]I'm making this slower and harder by just going through a tunnel to the left.
[38:40.21]There's no reason to do this.
[38:42.61]I'm making it harder.
[38:43.59]I don't have any more fuel.
[38:44.77]Got an axe!
[38:46.11]I'm about to be in deep shit, aren't I?
[39:04.12]Oh, okay.
[39:04.46]Now it shows you drop pod.
[39:05.92]You see where that is?
[39:06.70]Drop pod.
[39:07.57]That's actually not that far.
[39:09.31]Okay, that's where you got to go.
[39:13.61]How do I get fuel?
[39:16.21]You need to resupply.
[39:18.29]You should be able to call one now.
[39:21.15]I don't have enough.
[39:22.26]No, I can see it.
[39:26.44]I can see it.
[39:27.20]I can see it.
[39:28.34]Okay.
[39:30.26]The other fun strat, when you call in the...
[39:34.56]The supplies, it drills from, like, the top down.
[39:38.60]So if you call it underneath a launch pod or something, it just makes a straight line up.
[39:43.69]Yeah, I'm up here.
[39:44.25]Okay, I'm on my way.
[39:53.29]I see.
[39:55.75]You got some bugs behind you.
[39:56.77]Yeah, I'm bugging out.
[40:02.32]What is this?
[40:04.58]Oh, it's just a... Our computer's on the fritz.
[40:12.15]You look like your computer's having trouble.
[40:14.77]Yeah.
[40:18.53]So this is just like Left 4 Dead, we just have to get on.
[40:21.85]Yeah, you get on and it's over.
[40:26.77]There you go, that was baby mission.
[40:28.46]For babies.
[40:30.10]That just looked like it said no dwarves.
[40:33.80]Oh, no, it's no elves.
[40:35.64]Oh, this is new.
[40:43.95]Why do we do the Grand Theft Auto 5 lobby?
[40:48.19]Shit.
[40:48.79]Oh, you win a race.
[40:53.63]So, Jadiz and Bismore.
[40:56.39]Do we use these for stuff?
[40:58.65]Uh, yeah, I'll show you that now.
[41:00.38]I'll show you what you use the Jadiz on.
[41:03.46]Sick.
[41:05.02]Sick.
[41:09.88]How many chins does the driller have?
[41:11.28]A lot.
[41:11.78]So I did perks.
[41:14.29]I did one already.
[41:14.93]Oh yeah, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.
[41:16.57]What's up?
[41:16.91]Where are you?
[41:17.99]You come down here.
[41:18.69]In these terminals, like equipment.
[41:34.08]and you can upgrade your equipment and get new stuff oh this is cool I think this one's cosmetics yeah and this is all all your upgrades oh locked weapons so when you click on a gun it has like tears where it goes down you can only have one perk equipped per tier and so I need to level your money you need to be this is level four for the next row
[42:01.54]What's this like 4, 8, 12, 16 that goes down?
[42:04.68]I don't know what you're talking about.
[42:10.28]Equipment.
[42:10.90]When you open up a piece of equipment.
[42:14.08]Like open up your equipment and this should be red.
[42:17.72]You need to unlock levels.
[42:19.71]Those are your levels that you need to be.
[42:21.49]So should I increase the range of the flame for long distance incineration?
[42:27.13]How hard is it to come by some of these materials?
[42:29.81]Oh, it's Bismore.
[42:30.95]Okay, it's 1200 bucks in Bismore.
[42:35.24]Let's get it.
[42:38.96]That's cool.
[42:42.80]What about this one?
[42:44.75]Pinpoint accuracy on the first shot.
[42:47.25]Nice.
[42:49.71]I'm just gonna get it.
[42:51.37]I don't even want to play as this character.
[42:52.47]What am I doing?
[42:55.13]You don't?
[42:55.87]Can I refund what I just did?
[42:58.03]I don't think so.
[42:59.59]I want to try the... Well, alright.
[43:03.63]I'm playing as the... ...fucking frog neck guy.
[43:10.89]Jerma.
[43:11.49]It's alright.
[43:11.79]These last.
[43:13.55]This is a time-honored tradition around here.
[43:14.93]What I'm going to need for you to do is give me a... What?
[43:22.18]No, you...
[43:24.01]You just make the noise, like a boo.
[43:26.03]Make a boo, boo, boo.
[43:28.33]Why would I, when have I ever done that?
[43:31.01]When have I ever made that noise?
[43:32.58]When you and I have ever hung out together, ever, or made a video or been on stream?
[43:35.38]No, you don't.
[43:35.74]I do it on my stream all the time now.
[43:37.50]It's because, okay, I'll give you an example.
[43:40.88]Boo, boo.
[43:42.62]Oh, it's not, I can't record myself.
[43:43.76]See, I need you to do it.
[43:44.58]Okay, so you just want me to go, boo.
[43:47.86]Yeah.
[43:48.60]Boo, boo.
[43:50.16]Okay, wait.
[43:50.88]Boo.
[43:54.33]A different pitch one.
[43:59.66]Now a deep one.
[44:01.12]Okay.
[44:03.20]That's all I want.
[44:05.96]That's just... A hundred people just died in Roblox.
[44:11.04]That's what that was.
[44:12.74]They're dying!
[44:13.54]Oh god!
[44:14.38]Alright, how do I... Can I go into your room?
[44:22.30]Dude, I can go to your room.
[44:23.38]What do you got here?
[44:24.76]Where's your diary?
[44:26.26]I do not want to get legal involved in this.
[44:29.62]There's no secrets over here?
[44:31.66]Somebody's got a messy room.
[44:34.42]Somebody's got a messy room.
[44:36.36]My room is not messy.
[44:37.62]Yes, it is.
[44:38.62]Oh, yeah?
[44:39.42]What about the five McDonald's large cups over here?
[44:43.42]Oh, come on.
[44:44.88]Fucking idiot.
[44:45.64]You know what?
[44:46.40]I'm...
[44:47.86]Look at my room.
[44:48.60]It's clean.
[44:50.34]I did my laundry today.
[44:51.56]You're never getting out of your room.
[44:53.79]There's no secrets over here?
[44:56.57]That's all you have to say?
[44:58.11]You're all just looking for secrets all the time?
[45:00.19]How do I change characters?
[45:08.28]In your room, I think.
[45:09.44]There's no secrets over here?
[45:12.68]Come in your room.
[45:14.64]Guys, I didn't just say that.
[45:16.54]Over here.
[45:17.32]Over here.
[45:18.97]There's no secrets over here?
[45:19.99]There's no secrets over here?
[45:20.95]There's no secrets over here?
[45:27.33]There's no secrets over here?
[45:28.33]There's no secrets over here?
[45:30.47]There's no secrets over here?
[45:32.03]There's no secrets over here?
[45:48.16]Are you slash following me?
[45:48.86]What is this fucking work?
[45:49.66]Alright, let's play the fun thing.
[45:50.82]Okay.
[45:51.00]Yeah, this is all, yeah, this is the real game.
[45:58.90]Yeah, this is like the Trevor versus Star game.
[46:00.74]Ooh.
[46:00.88]Yeah.
[46:19.46]I'm gonna do another one.
[46:20.42]Go until you don't do it.
[46:23.07]You're gonna kill me with that shit.
[46:36.77]Oh, I want to hear what one of them sounds like because you're probably dead because you couldn't hear yourself.
[46:41.95]Wait, is this No Secrets over here?
[46:44.61]No, you were pretty good.
[46:45.71]Okay, I got 250, but it fucked me up because I have No Secrets over here?
[46:50.80]Yes!
[46:59.75]No, no, no.
[47:00.11]You have to reset it.
[47:01.71]Fuck you.
[47:02.17]Reset that counter.
[47:03.35]Oh, what?
[47:04.77]I got 250.
[47:06.21]I got 250.
[47:07.18]Go until you don't hit.
[47:09.74]Go until I don't hit.
[47:10.78]Go until you miss.
[47:12.30]Okay, wait.
[47:12.84]How long do I go?
[47:15.10]Until you miss.
[47:16.86]There's no time limit.
[47:18.36]Okay.
[47:23.85]Thanks.
[47:24.13]I win.
[47:25.35]What?
[47:25.55]I didn't miss.
[47:26.37]Wait, I thought it looked like you did.
[47:28.21]No, it rolled in.
[47:30.14]Go until you miss.
[47:31.20]Until you miss.
[47:32.56]I didn't miss!
[47:34.96]Oh, my game's lagging!
[47:35.66]My game's lagging!
[47:36.74]He missed.
[47:37.38]What the fuck?
[47:38.14]Thank you!
[47:39.14]Thank you!
[47:39.64]Thank you!
[47:41.06]Oh yeah, my game lagged.
[47:43.50]Oldest trick in the book.
[47:48.96]I mean, I did, but you missed again.
[47:51.34]I got 250 points.
[47:54.60]Are we just gonna sit around and do jokes?
[47:56.28]Why am I doing this?
[47:59.07]Why am I doing the Fortnite thing?
[48:00.87]Why am I doing the... It feels like you just took over my computer.
[48:07.03]It got loud.
[48:15.79]It really does feel like you just got control here.
[48:19.11]Oh, it's the jukebox.
[48:20.11]Okay.
[48:34.43]You're a real funny tuber doing the floss.
[48:36.43]Somebody just said I'm unsubbing.
[48:39.39]My computer was taken over.
[48:40.57]I had no control over that environment.
[48:42.53]If it was under my control, I would not have done that.
[48:45.94]Here, I'll kick a fucking water bucket into his head.
[48:48.08]Does it make you happy?
[48:50.30]What?
[48:50.84]What?
[48:51.74]Wait, I need to upgrade.
[48:53.38]Equipment.
[48:55.50]Alright, what is your guy's ability now?
[48:57.10]I don't remember.
[48:57.82]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[48:59.74]What does he do to an ability?
[49:01.66]um I don't know are you sure I I don't how do I look at it you start a mission and then you you play the game alright well this is the I'm just I'm gonna play as this guy hey you do it too you just did it everybody does that especially you know you because you're a fool and I want you to know that you're a fool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay let's go
[49:28.91]I didn't get that.
[49:29.69]That's a good one.
[49:30.45]No, I didn't get that one.
[49:33.27]Wait, is this no secret zone?
[49:36.24]That's all I have.
[49:37.62]That's all you have now.
[49:40.08]It gets too long for you to have the part that you want.
[49:50.06]Okay, I'm setting this to hazard four extreme.
[49:53.17]Are you ready?
[49:53.95]Why would you do that?
[49:57.05]What?
[49:57.63]Why would you make it that hard?
[49:59.37]Okay, we're doing hazard three.
[50:00.95]We were on hazard two, and that was baby mode.
[50:04.27]Alright, well.
[50:09.16]So we're going to go up to three.
[50:10.20]Can you handle it?
[50:10.96]Salvage two mules.
[50:12.74]There's no secrets over here?
[50:15.72]I can't tell if that's the original one or if that's one of those that I did previously.
[50:19.30]I don't know.
[50:20.18]That's a previous.
[50:23.09]Get on board.
[50:23.97]We're about to leave.
[50:25.69]I'm ready.
[50:28.63]Okay.
[50:28.89]Okay.
[50:31.57]What, 12?
[50:32.55]A Pokéblu.
[50:33.41]Are these, uh, flowers?
[50:34.87]Yeah, we gotta get, um, Pokéballs.
[50:43.48]Okay.
[50:49.62]Where's the escape pod?
[50:50.74]The mule leaves behind a trail of green markers when it returns to the escape pod.
[50:53.99]Follow those.
[50:54.79]Oh, that's cool.
[50:59.20]Why did my computer slow than yours?
[51:00.90]What do you have for processor?
[51:07.58]45,000k20.
[51:08.76]I don't want to be the guy in League of Legends that fucking loads in last.
[51:11.76]You look like an asshole.
[51:14.19]Loads in last.
[51:16.29]I don't want to be the guy the League of Legends the fuck loads in last.
[51:21.05]I don't want to be that guy.
[51:22.11]Alright, here, hustle, hustle, hustle.
[51:26.21]Hustle.
[51:30.88]Okay, we need uh, we gotta salvage two mules as a new mission type.
[51:35.11]I haven't done this.
[51:35.93]Okay, so I have a tether.
[51:37.43]Oh, yeah, yeah, you're the guy with the wires.
[51:40.99]Yeah, I was just testing.
[51:43.41]Okay.
[51:43.99]Well, you're a wire guy.
[51:45.70]Okay, he's just testing.
[51:46.98]I'm testing.
[51:47.56]I just want... Alright, cool.
[51:50.16]That's how that works.
[51:50.90]Nice.
[51:52.58]Alright, so we need to salvage.
[51:55.29]What are these?
[51:55.71]Ew.
[51:58.61]I think they just explode on you.
[52:00.65]Also, if you're going up these and you press reverse, you can just hover over a chasm so when a lot of bugs come out, you can kind of just kill in the middle.
[52:08.54]Oh, I see.
[52:10.34]You can just go backwards.
[52:11.52]That's cool.
[52:13.14]That is really cool.
[52:13.58]Watch out.
[52:13.84]There are some flying bugs in this game.
[52:18.41]So is that my only means of transportation?
[52:20.27]I have to use this to get up there?
[52:22.96]Wherever you're going?
[52:24.40]Yeah, or you can just like... You can just Minecraft your way in?
[52:30.32]I guess you can.
[52:30.90]If it's not far, then you're going to want to save uses of your grapple.
[52:37.04]Alright, let's get going.
[52:37.79]Good thing I just wasted two of them.
[52:44.77]Yeah.
[52:45.53]Watch out, there's a pit here.
[52:49.27]Okay.
[52:49.73]Don't worry.
[52:51.35]So, is this an opportunity to use this?
[52:54.17]Yeah.
[52:57.38]It's just too... It's just too steep.
[53:00.96]Now it's REALLY steep!
[53:09.38]How do I get out of here now, if I'm this character?
[53:14.72]I don't know.
[53:15.34]It looks too steep.
[53:16.36]I think you gotta dig your way up.
[53:18.26]Do I actually have to dig out of here?
[53:20.24]Yeah.
[53:24.21]Here, here, here.
[53:24.89]Dig with me.
[53:26.53]On this side.
[53:34.61]I should have brought a driller, perhaps.
[53:36.26]Maybe.
[53:37.66]Guys, what is the other guy?
[53:39.08]There's the scout, the driller, the... Engineer.
[53:42.26]The...
[53:43.91]Oh, yeah, he, like, builds a turret?
[53:45.07]Yep, he builds turrets.
[53:45.85]Alright, thank you.
[53:49.09]Oh, yeah, no, and he makes platforms.
[53:50.81]He's really good.
[53:53.01]Makes pla- Ah, that's awesome.
[53:56.13]Yeah, maybe I should play him so we can actually, you know, get some teamwork going.
[53:59.22]But I- What am I supposed to do about this?
[54:02.20]Can I make this jump?
[54:03.74]Is that gonna- Am I gonna hit the wall?
[54:10.56]Can I jump from here?
[54:12.98]Can I jump from here?
[54:14.35]Try it.
[54:14.63]I don't know.
[54:14.95]Yep.
[54:15.81]Alright, cool.
[54:19.75]Let's go.
[54:21.73]Are those the flowers we need?
[54:23.49]Oh, yeah, and you can dig while you're on it.
[54:24.89]You can, like, make a foothold.
[54:27.97]I mean, I wish we had a driller.
[54:30.23]We did.
[54:30.65]Yeah, that'd be really helpful right now if we had someone who could drill through this.
[54:37.25]We can.
[54:38.35]We're doing it manual drilling.
[54:47.27]I'm just burying the axe in the back of your head.
[54:53.27]That's what I think about you.
[54:56.10]What does that mean?
[54:57.78]What's wrong with your computer?
[54:59.64]I have no idea.
[55:00.50]It's been doing this with every game.
[55:02.92]And I have no idea why.
[55:03.94]What do you have for a graphics card?
[55:07.51]Uh, a 24080?
[55:08.25]I don't know.
[55:08.85]A 24080?
[55:08.95]I think it's like a Titan X Pascal.
[55:12.57]Is this like 2804?
[55:13.05]Or it might be more than that.
[55:13.71]What year is it?
[55:14.11]It's like 1900.
[55:14.44]1900?
[55:14.54]Can you help me mine this?
[55:15.68]I can't even go.
[55:17.00]Okay, there's like a... What are these?
[55:18.38]Dead.
[55:18.50]Dead.
[55:37.41]We shouldn't have done that.
[55:38.07]That was not, but they weren't a threat.
[55:40.27]The environment will fix itself.
[55:51.97]You're the most like environmentally conscious dwarf I have ever seen.
[56:00.08]We only know one thing and it's digging.
[56:04.16]Digging and killing.
[56:08.10]Wait, did he just not drop anything?
[56:09.40]Oh, I don't know.
[56:17.05]I wish I could see more light.
[56:19.51]Oh, well, I have the light gun.
[56:21.93]Is that your job?
[56:24.39]Yeah, but, like, I'm not blind, so I've been fine.
[56:26.62]That's because you turn your gamma all the way up.
[56:28.82]I've been to his house.
[56:32.06]You haven't been to Austin ever.
[56:33.30]He turns up his gamma all the way and then pretends like he can see really well.
[56:37.58]It's bullshit.
[56:40.18]Watch out, we got bugs.
[56:49.57]Yes, we do.
[56:51.43]Remember, we're at a higher hazard level, Jerma.
[57:00.59]This game actually is really fun when you have people and you're on a really high difficulty and you gotta hustle.
[57:05.62]And there's a million buggos.
[57:08.46]Seems like it.
[57:09.86]But you just can't stop making jokes for more than like two seconds.
[57:15.65]I didn't start it.
[57:17.25]Loads in last.
[57:20.69]Alright, cool.
[57:25.08]That's all you have is a rebuttal.
[57:27.02]I'm trying to play the game and all you have to say... You can't take cadences and make that some kind of an insult.
[57:34.27]Everybody has cadences.
[57:36.79]You can't make a cadence and... Come on.
[57:42.79]That's what they're calling it?
[57:43.65]A cadence?
[57:44.52]We all have cadences.
[57:45.60]I feel like that's some form of political correctness where you...
[57:51.71]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[58:17.76]Are you alright?
[58:18.26]Was that your computer?
[58:20.16]Yeah, my computer just, I didn't, I guess, what's going on here?
[58:23.11]I don't know what that was.
[58:26.25]It was one person from the, it's not even.
[58:29.07]It was the whole cast.
[58:30.63]The whole cast?
[58:32.91]They were like, games are dumb.
[58:34.36]Watch my new show.
[58:35.64]No, it was one guy.
[58:37.68]And, alright, I'm in trouble.
[58:39.58]What is this?
[58:40.28]What's the guy's name?
[58:42.52]Who is doing this?
[58:43.68]What the?
[58:44.19]What the fuck is going on to me?
[58:45.99]Where are you?
[58:52.40]You see?
[58:53.42]I'm shouting.
[58:55.14]I don't know.
[58:55.76]We got swarmed and you ran away instead of making Always Sunny references.
[59:02.58]Look, I'm shouting.
[59:03.22]What?
[59:03.84]Oh god, you're fucking... What is going on right now?
[59:09.09]You're loading in last right now.
[59:10.51]Fuck loads in last.
[59:12.49]I'm flying.
[59:14.61]I'm flying around.
[59:15.41]You're getting carried away by a bug.
[59:21.55]Shouldn't have dropped me, idiot.
[59:25.26]I'm coming.
[59:26.42]I'm still, I'm fine.
[59:27.94]That's like a smoker.
[59:31.18]Can you shout so I know where you are?
[59:36.30]There you are.
[59:38.16]How did you even get over there?
[59:41.52]Well, I saw that you were down here, and I was seeing if I could... It seemed faster.
[59:51.61]Macaulay Culkin?
[59:52.61]Dude, I'm flying!
[59:56.33]This is what happens when you're in a dream.
[59:57.85]When you're in a flying, flying dream.
[59:59.55]You don't have control of where you're flying, you just know you are.
[60:12.05]Jeremy.
[60:13.13]I'm taking care of this bug.
[60:14.27]Alright, this bug is dead.
[60:15.25]Here.
[60:15.43]Do you see where I am?
[60:17.75]Yeah.
[60:18.53]Okay, let's go.
[60:21.70]Alright.
[60:22.46]I just showed up just in time.
[60:29.10]I dug a really big hole for you.
[60:31.48]You did that for me?
[60:33.09]I did it for you.
[60:35.25]Aww.
[60:37.83]What?
[60:43.09]Okay.
[60:47.17]There's my hole, I think.
[60:48.74]Is that?
[60:49.12]No, that's not my hole.
[60:49.96]There it is, up there.
[60:50.80]That's a big hole.
[60:55.92]What?
[60:56.84]You can fly around.
[60:57.80]You have a grapple hook.
[61:01.62]What does that have to do with anything?
[61:02.72]That has to do with you have to be aware that I can't do that.
[61:05.36]You have to help me.
[61:06.26]I'm the ground force.
[61:09.43]Okay.
[61:09.87]EDF.
[61:11.87]Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry!
[61:16.87]We're the... That's the only thing I know.
[61:26.88]This is a huge room.
[61:33.54]Oh, is this one of the mules?
[61:36.80]probably what are you that looks like a mule watch out alright these things just are blowing up all over the place around us I'm almost dead they're banelings those things are horrible oh I think we gotta dig this up oh yeah we gotta we gotta pick up all the parts
[62:07.83]Help, help, help, help, help, help.
[62:19.05]My computer's lagging.
[62:21.32]I can't help you.
[62:22.74]Three more of those creepers came and exploded on us.
[62:26.94]How did you end up down there?
[62:32.46]I got picked up by a fly bug.
[62:34.99]He just threw you down the hole.
[62:42.95]Where's my recorder?
[62:44.77]Where's my recorder for it?
[62:55.79]Why do you have it on hazard five?
[62:58.36]I didn't I had it on hazard like we're competent people that can play this game.
[63:02.64]Oh
[63:09.76]Guys, can I have, like, a thousand people diagnose my computer problem all at once?
[63:14.08]Alright, I can help you.
[63:22.62]Give me the symptoms.
[63:23.26]When do they start?
[63:25.61]It's, like, intermittently.
[63:29.45]Every, like, ten minutes.
[63:30.79]Okay.
[63:31.63]My game freezes, like, four times.
[63:33.75]Do you have any hard disks?
[63:36.51]No.
[63:36.85]Are you all solid state?
[63:38.83]Yes.
[63:39.45]Are you sure?
[63:40.89]Yes.
[63:41.59]Okay.
[63:41.71]When was the last time you did a driver update?
[63:47.27]Good question.
[63:49.09]May have just solved your problem.
[63:51.81]John!
[63:57.59]Also, how much RAM do you have?
[64:08.07]Um... You're gonna tell me to download more?
[64:13.07]No, I'm not- that's- but is this like 2017 joke?
[64:18.93]Yeah, I mean you do them sometimes.
[64:20.41]You were doing the flossing dance earlier.
[64:24.67]2017 is really not that long ago, so like, that joke would still be kind of relevant.
[64:28.10]But, no, how much, what do you have, 32?
[64:29.44]16?
[64:29.50]Uh, I think I have two 16s.
[64:33.34]I didn't do the flaw.
[64:34.58]First of all, I need to, like, I need to scream in your, I gotta scream in your face as loud as I can.
[64:39.70]I did not do the flaw, so you put the jukebox on and took control of my computer and made that happen.
[64:45.91]But I also did see you dab before.
[64:47.61]So have you.
[64:53.70]No.
[64:56.10]Last time I was at your house, you did.
[64:58.26]When was the last time you were at my house?
[65:02.10]Alright, let's do that mission again, but not on, like, ultra inferno mode.
[65:05.81]That's, like, normal difficulty.
[65:08.07]Is it?
[65:09.25]Let me see.
[65:12.09]We should be able to do that.
[65:16.95]He's deflecting.
[65:22.09]I'm not deflecting.
[65:23.19]We're doing it the same difficulty.
[65:26.08]And you know what?
[65:26.72]I'm going to switch characters.
[65:29.30]So am I. That's a good idea.
[65:31.66]So that I can work together with you.
[65:33.04]And you know we can both be low-level newbies.
[65:35.15]So I'm going to be the driller again.
[65:36.39]I kind of like that.
[65:37.05]It was fun.
[65:38.83]Okay.
[65:39.13]And I'll be the engineer.
[65:40.17]So at least I can travel around now.
[65:41.95]And I have an upgraded flamethrower.
[65:43.51]Do you accept me?
[65:46.42]Yes.
[65:47.34]Why wouldn't I?
[65:50.54]That's a pretty... Dude, that... Bro, that's an epic beard.
[65:55.12]I can't... There's too many people talking!
[65:58.10]There's voices in my head!
[65:59.32]I'm the only person talking to you.
[66:01.76]Help!
[66:08.26]Yep.
[66:08.98]Alright.
[66:12.67]I think you've played too many sounds.
[66:14.21]Let's get this mission rolling!
[66:17.88]You've played too many other... How many other people you got on that soundboard?
[66:20.96]It was Normal Man was talking to me.
[66:24.90]He interrupts my stream sometimes.
[66:26.93]Normal Man?
[66:28.81]Yeah.
[66:29.49]There's a couple characters around here.
[66:34.79]Normal Man's just telling me to kill Yerma.
[66:38.85]Well, um... Don't listen to that guy.
[66:43.03]I'm not.
[66:43.53]Don't worry.
[66:44.39]They're all corrupted.
[66:45.23]See...
[66:47.98]everyone banded together and killed Justin so I replaced him with Kimberly but Kimberly was secretly the person who killed Justin so I had to get rid of Kimberly and then we got Japanese voice lady who apparently is god and we went through a couple of different guys and now it's a normal guy normal man who likes uh white bread and tennis you should probably go to a doctor if I were to give you some advice you probably should hit up a doctor okay
[67:12.87]Yeah, you try and explain the Jerm allure to somebody and like not have to see a therapist.
[67:27.97]How do we know that I'm not one of the voices in your head?
[67:32.33]I don't know, how can you prove it?
[67:33.33]I've been playing alone this whole time and everyone in my chat is just like, who does he think he's with?
[67:39.79]He's just talking.
[67:41.59]I was last to load in again.
[67:42.99]I need a... I need a... Is a 2080 any good?
[67:51.80]Yeah, it's very good.
[67:52.88]Is it?
[67:53.28]It has the RTX... Don't you dare do that.
[67:56.70]Don't say that.
[67:57.30]I know you're gonna do the... Alright, which one... This is like... Alright, so that's my spotlight.
[68:01.85]That's your spotlight.
[68:07.64]Is this when the curtain comes up, or there's an audience back here?
[68:12.44]Yeah.
[68:13.26]I got all solid state, too.
[68:14.28]This is bullshit.
[68:32.85]Okay.
[68:33.93]Sorry, I had to shoot that thing.
[68:35.35]Okay, okay.
[68:35.87]You see this flower?
[68:37.19]Do I see this flower?
[68:38.15]I do.
[68:39.13]There's one behind you.
[68:39.81]Let's go back here.
[68:43.63]Let's do it.
[68:44.01]Okay, but no more fucking around.
[68:45.48]We made our funny joke.
[68:46.80]This is a serious mission.
[68:47.66]There's no secrets here.
[68:48.94]We made our one joke.
[68:50.28]It's been like five minutes.
[68:51.60]Let's just get to it, right?
[68:53.92]Yes.
[68:54.24]Why wouldn't I?
[68:55.22]That's what I said.
[68:56.96]Did you talk to yourself?
[68:58.44]I was.
[68:59.96]And you kind of interrupted me.
[69:04.55]Okay.
[69:05.65]I should be playing this multi-boxing with three other Miis.
[69:10.52]We'd get so much done.
[69:11.40]Then you would make the pro team.
[69:14.74]You want to dig through here?
[69:15.88]I can handle that.
[69:18.16]Oh, you're Drill Guy!
[69:19.36]Yeah!
[69:20.16]That's why I changed.
[69:20.92]Uh, wrong way.
[69:28.82]I figured.
[69:30.66]Yeah, what the heck?
[69:31.30]That should have been right, though.
[69:32.88]That is weird.
[69:35.99]Because, yeah, these dirt areas always lead to a new path.
[69:42.45]There it is.
[69:44.30]Computer's breaking.
[69:45.20]How's your computer?
[69:48.62]Not good.
[69:53.98]Now it's fine.
[69:55.32]You definitely have... No, there's definitely... You got a virus.
[69:59.76]Yeah, I look at a lot of just messed up stuff.
[70:03.16]Remember that time you got that virus that locked on your whole computer?
[70:09.32]Yes.
[70:11.20]Yes, I do remember.
[70:13.82]I got ransomware to like give us your computer or give us $400 and we have your computer virus.
[70:22.15]Like, how do you get this virus?
[70:26.02]Yeah, you got, like, all your- everything on your computer encrypted, and you got, like, ransomware.
[70:31.43]That was fucked up.
[70:33.27]Oh, over this way.
[70:35.57]There's a- are you sure?
[70:36.39]There's, uh, rare- rare materials, and here's the stuff, everything's over here, but watch out, because these sometimes bugs are going on here.
[70:43.65]Don't get exploded on.
[70:46.86]You got exploded on, didn't you?
[70:51.58]Bugs!
[70:53.46]There's too many people talking!
[70:57.11]Watch out!
[70:57.39]You have to build that?
[70:58.19]Holy shit dude, I can't even see anything!
[70:59.33]I turned my DPI on my mouse up.
[71:01.11]Are you sure this is not like Hazard 8?
[71:02.19]But what's the problem then?
[71:23.76]No, I can do this.
[71:24.30]You're the problem.
[71:25.92]I'm the problem.
[71:27.22]I'm the problem!
[71:28.64]I just built your thing for you.
[71:38.91]What is making the ball pit?
[71:41.47]It's a pooper!
[71:42.71]It's a McDonald's poop pit.
[71:44.03]I don't think they have the...
[71:59.46]Oh, what just happened?
[72:06.85]The McDonald's poop pit.
[72:09.39]Patent pending.
[72:10.71]Patent pending.
[72:11.42]Alright, so... Can we, like, collect this axe?
[72:12.52]I want to hit... Oh, no, that's your throwing axe.
[72:13.92]Yeah, that's my throwing axe.
[72:14.72]I just did a lot of good work with that thing.
[72:16.24]Alright, so... I got a lot of stuff.
[72:20.94]Okay, you gotta put it in the guy.
[72:22.85]I did.
[72:23.15]So, where's the machine that we have to get?
[72:26.32]uh you see all these uh hold on there's about to be 60 voices in my head ow give me like I'm trying to learn the game mode
[72:49.10]I can kill this with one hit if I'm good.
[72:51.02]Am I good enough?
[72:52.26]Oh, it's bouncing me.
[72:53.84]I'm kind of good.
[72:55.96]My axe goes through it.
[72:58.84]Oh, really?
[72:59.54]Yeah.
[73:00.78]Okay, so you have to dig up these white circles.
[73:03.18]Okay, I've got an arm.
[73:04.00]I don't know what we're doing with them.
[73:05.92]I've got an arm.
[73:06.30]Because I couldn't deposit it.
[73:07.98]Wait, mine just went through the floor.
[73:09.30]I just attached a leg on this.
[73:12.92]I think we might have just softlocked.
[73:14.82]No, we didn't.
[73:16.90]I'm attaching legs.
[73:19.42]It's good, it's good, it's repaired.
[73:20.64]It fell in the ground.
[73:21.86]Okay, are we good?
[73:22.60]Just watch me.
[73:24.22]Just watch, just watch.
[73:25.60]No, I mean, like, defend me.
[73:28.25]I'm doing, I'm repairing my turret.
[73:29.99]Are you?
[73:30.55]Because I just got bold.

[77:12.93]It's not even a real game.
[77:14.15]They start you in, like, a fake room.
[77:19.74]Help me.
[77:21.30]This is two out of two.
[77:22.60]How many flowers do you have?
[77:27.94]Well done.
[77:28.74]You're repaired.
[77:29.46]Okay.
[77:33.82]We need seven.
[77:34.94]We need more of those packs.
[77:39.10]One sentry gun ready to be used.
[77:54.19]I can't see.
[77:56.11]Yes, why wouldn't I?
[77:58.83]I feel like you accidentally just pressed that button.
[78:02.25]No.
[78:02.71]I mean, I didn't know what it was, but I pressed it on purpose.
[78:12.24]Alright, we need more flowers.
[78:13.42]We need more flowers.
[78:16.98]Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[78:18.24]Didn't you say we need more, uh, malachite?
[78:22.61]Whatever it's called?
[78:23.17]Uh... No, it was nitro that we needed for the respland.
[78:28.45]We got it.
[78:29.03]Oh, okay.
[78:29.95]It's just flowers.
[78:30.81]Good.
[78:35.64]Could you do me a favor?
[78:41.08]Yeah?
[78:42.00]Could you, uh, cap this?
[78:46.55]Uh, yes.
[78:52.08]Oh, give me a different tone.
[78:53.28]What do you think I'm doing?
[78:56.28]Okay.
[79:03.64]I wasn't ready!
[79:07.27]Okay.
[79:11.59]You're very talented.

[79:32.31]What?
[79:35.33]Where's the supply?
[79:39.09]Yeah.
[79:50.96]Are you picking up flowers or are you just being a fucking comedian?
[79:53.44]I got two flowers.
[79:54.38]I'm holding them right now.
[79:55.32]Alright, we need to go up.
[79:57.96]Bunch of dwarves.
[79:59.38]Oh, we're tough dwarves.
[80:00.30]Big beards.
[80:00.82]Let's go pick flowers.
[80:02.08]Why are none of the dwarves the default dwarf?
[80:09.36]This can't be a dwarf game unless one of them talks like this.
[80:15.27]I mean, they do a little bit.
[80:16.71]Alright!
[80:18.05]No, they have to do... That's the only way you can tell if it's a dwarf.
[80:21.09]If they go... Alright!
[80:22.11]Okay.
[80:25.77]Uh, where have we not been?
[80:33.11]I don't know.
[80:35.30]Have we been down this tunnel?
[80:37.48]We go up.
[80:39.76]Up or down?
[80:41.18]That's Shrek.
[80:42.16]Oh, there's nothing here.
[80:44.14]Put the Shrek voice over a dwarf.
[80:46.47]And it's perfect.
[80:48.91]Not bad, pretty good.
[80:53.51]Alright, just follow me.
[80:56.31]I'm checking this out.
[80:57.98]We can go up.
[81:00.08]Where?
[81:00.50]Where are you?
[81:02.10]Oh.
[81:03.26]Okay.
[81:06.28]Take me up.
[81:06.98]Pick me up.
[81:08.96]Have we been like up?
[81:10.34]We've been like here, right?
[81:14.65]no there's not any um what um I don't know where is it until you miss go until you miss I don't have it you don't have it I couldn't find it why do you still have to go until you miss one yeah this flowers
[81:38.48]Well, it's funny when I do it, but then when you do it, you get to... It's not funny.
[81:42.76]No, no, no, no, no.
[81:43.38]When you do it, you get to then catch yourself and then pretend that you're making fun of me.
[81:50.51]Oh, I get it.
[81:51.49]I see.
[81:52.05]It's not funny.
[81:52.91]Cerebral cadence is a serious disorder.
[81:56.43]It's funny when I go... Oh, I'm doing the turbo.
[81:59.71]Right?
[81:59.99]Right?
[82:00.17]Oh.
[82:00.35]Interesting.
[82:00.79]Interesting.
[82:11.39]It's funny when I do it.
[82:12.17]I don't know.
[82:14.90]What is that?
[82:15.18]Every dwarf is the exact same character.
[82:16.66]Don't say that.
[82:18.90]Can we not open this?
[82:19.52]We haven't been this way.
[82:20.28]Come this way.
[82:22.24]There's eyeballs over here.
[82:24.88]Eyeballs?
[82:27.46]Just drill these eyeballs.
[82:29.56]Dude, calm down, Jerma.
[82:30.98]This is meant to be fun.
[82:33.22]Look over here!
[82:34.64]Just drill those eyeballs.
[82:36.18]Drill them?
[82:37.46]Drill them.
[82:39.09]They're moving around.
[82:47.49]That's common rock?
[82:48.93]How would that be common?
[82:55.55]That's pretty uncommon.
[82:56.53]There's nothing even in there.
[83:00.53]You were supposed to drill them to death.
[83:03.81]I did.
[83:04.11]And now you can't get the secret.
[83:08.62]I thought I did.
[83:09.22]I thought I did.
[83:09.92]I guess not.
[83:18.06]We're passing flowers.
[83:19.14]People are telling me we're passing flowers.
[83:21.84]What?
[83:22.12]No, I grabbed it.
[83:28.33]Five more?
[83:32.05]Five more.
[83:33.13]Keep going.
[83:33.69]Let's keep out on lookout.
[83:41.31]Don't see anything.
[83:45.61]Don't say anything.
[83:46.57]I know what that tastes like.
[83:49.17]What?
[83:50.93]I know what that tastes like.
[83:52.33]The red sugar.
[83:55.23]Flower.
[83:55.45]You're just saying random nouns.
[84:00.66]The sugar.
[84:01.24]The red sugar health thing.
[84:02.70]I feel like I know what that tastes like.
[84:05.06]What does it taste like?
[84:07.34]Why do I have to explain that to you?
[84:10.86]I just know what that tastes like.
[84:13.48]Uh, need a driller here.
[84:14.88]It tastes like a red Jolly Rancher.
[84:18.78]There, are you happy?
[84:20.67]God, man.
[84:21.43]Some people.
[84:24.73]That scared me.
[84:25.57]I thought you were a bug.
[84:28.41]Well, this, uh, we ended up kind of this way.
[84:35.27]Oh, we're just back in this room.
[84:36.77]That's exactly what I was thinking.
[84:38.13]Is that right?
[84:40.57]I feel like I'm talking to the Jerma soundboard.
[84:43.99]That's your own fault for making it in the first place.
[84:50.46]Deposit the flowers.
[84:52.42]I have three.
[84:52.90]How many do you have?
[84:55.18]One.
[84:56.12]Oh, really?
[84:57.72]How did I get three and you only got one?

[85:52.21]Hold on, wait.
[85:53.03]Wait, no, we were supposed to do this.
[85:55.15]Were we?

[90:46.09]My what?
[90:47.45]Your orc.
[90:50.73]You're dancing orc.
[90:53.76]It attracts the bugs to kill it.
[90:56.02]I'm just going to stand back here.
[91:03.33]You're gonna get overwhelmed.
[91:04.57]People above you, too.
[91:05.31]I got my turrets up.
[91:07.77]It's fine.
[91:11.25]Here.

[91:47.44]YOLO.
[91:48.02]A one-life gameplay?
[91:54.59]Oh, computer.
[91:56.31]Must have been 10 minutes.
[92:00.88]Fuel cells at 75%.

[92:05.80]Where's he going?
[92:06.24]Around the other corner?
[92:12.16]Watch your fire, moron!
[92:13.64]That guy just fucked me up.
[92:15.19]Excuse me?
[92:24.19]Hey, cover me up.
[92:24.71]Cover me.

[92:36.45]Good.
[92:36.75]Throw!
[92:37.15]Look out!

[93:30.53]People are trying to, like...
[93:33.32]We're staging a coup.
[93:39.98]What is he talking about?
[93:41.83]What is he even talking about?
[93:43.67]There's people.
[93:49.39]Okay, before we got on the call, before we got on the call, what did you specifically ask me?
[93:54.51]If what?
[93:56.60]If I was going to what?
[93:59.56]be... What was it?
[94:02.18]I wanted to make sure you weren't going to ruin my fun gameplay session by being silly.
[94:07.48]Oh, being like weird and being silly.
[94:09.74]Yeah.
[94:10.78]You're talking about like people in your head speaking to you and like then you just talked about like Uganda.
[94:19.59]What?
[94:20.01]Take your own advice.
[94:30.28]No, that wasn't you.
[94:31.00]That's when you win the mission.
[94:34.86]That wasn't you.
[94:37.63]There's someone like... There's like an orchestra in my head.
[94:48.70]Like gospel singing.
[94:49.70]I can't get it to stop.
[94:51.98]It just keeps... You're making me lose my mind.
[94:59.31]I think we could start a ban.
[95:00.77]Alright, hold on.
[95:01.49]I think we might have a third player here.
[95:04.59]Possible.
[95:07.18]It's possible.
[95:09.54]Possible third player, everybody.
[95:11.34]Yeah.
[95:11.56]Well, let me go P and see if there's a possible third player.
[95:14.42]Alright.

[95:41.91]Also, why do you always need a new driver?
[95:47.21]Why can't they just use the same one?
[95:53.50]My computer used to work if this were the problem.
[96:03.32]You know what I'm saying?

[101:18.21]What's so funny?
[101:28.22]It's not funny from the other perspective where you have to, like, watch other people be friends from, like, outside your window.

[101:41.06]Watch and learn!

[101:56.39]Okay, I'm inviting you to this lobby.
[101:58.45]Why can't you guys just have your actual names?
[102:01.85]Because I don't want my actual name, okay?
[102:04.36]I want it to be something interesting.
[102:06.84]Why can't you be twitch.tv/Jerma985 on Steam?
[102:14.33]Why do I have to be?
[102:15.93]Did you get the invite?
[102:16.49]You don't have to be.
[102:17.29]I'm just suggesting.
[102:18.31]Hey, Etalyx, can you say, like, the first part of your ABCs?
[102:27.10]Hey, guys, what's up?
[102:28.20]Alright, you're good.
[102:29.70]Yes.
[102:30.22]That's not the first part of your ABCs, but that's okay.
[102:33.56]No.
[102:37.16]Actually, it was kind of the first part of your ABCs.
[102:39.85]No.
[102:40.09]No.
[102:44.97]Alright, we ready?
[102:46.67]Stixon's still joining.
[102:53.60]I'm gonna have to, like, re-explain the whole game just for Stixon?
[102:57.04]Yep.
[102:57.66]You are.
[102:58.72]You're gonna have to re-explain everything.
[103:00.90]Everything.
[103:01.86]Everything.
[103:03.08]No.
[103:04.61]Yeah, he is.
[103:05.75]He's gonna have to explain everything.
[103:06.75]No.
[103:07.35]He is, though, because you don't know how to explain it.
[103:08.87]Where is this guy?
[103:11.29]What?
[103:16.72]The fuck is happening?
[103:21.82]Hello?
[103:22.50]Am I the only fucking person in here?
[103:23.70]What's going on?
[103:24.18]Are you serious?
[103:31.87]Hey guys, what's up?
[103:33.51]Can I start the mission?
[103:34.67]Is he actually here?
[103:36.49]No.
[103:46.18]Hey, I'm pinned down over here.
[103:47.32]Are you even playing?
[103:56.12]I think we have to do baby missions because he's like the newbies join.
[104:00.14]No, he's good at video games.
[104:01.30]He knows what he's doing.
[104:02.52]Well, no, no.
[104:03.18]Like it has a lot of them are locked now.
[104:05.52]Well, we can just let's blow through it.
[104:10.68]I'm doing hazard four.
[104:15.34]I didn't know that.
[104:16.00]Wow.
[104:16.90]Wait, are we doing Hazard 4?
[104:20.22]That's Etalyx.
[104:20.81]Welcome to Etalyx.
[104:23.09]I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[104:33.15]I'm gonna throw up on this stream.
[104:34.95]I know what's gonna happen here.
[104:36.53]I have a sinking feeling.
[104:40.49]I don't know.
[104:40.93]This is gonna be bad.
[104:42.72]I'm gonna puke.
[104:45.93]Need ammo!
[104:46.21]What do you think I'm doing?
[104:47.87]Oh my god, I'm in a fucking cube.
[104:50.11]Can we go back?
[104:50.91]No.
[104:51.39]Please!
[104:52.41]Shut up, I'm trying to save!
[104:56.41]Rock and stone!
[104:58.69]Alright, do you know how to play this, Etalyx?
[105:00.36]Yes.
[105:00.52]Okay, so...
[105:11.37]You, it's left for, uh, it's left for dead.
[105:14.89]The only difference is you have to mine.
[105:16.72]We have to see the top right of your screen.
[105:18.30]We have to get 225 more kite.
[105:20.62]We have to extract it together.
[105:22.56]And you pick a class, and there's four classes.
[105:24.80]And... Hey, can I get a closer look?
[105:26.66]Yeah, you come over here and look at this.
[105:28.27]He's building a sentry.
[105:32.31]Wow.
[105:32.75]I'm not sure who you picked.
[105:33.73]Hey, who did you pick for a class, Vitalix?
[105:36.13]What's your class?
[105:38.76]It's a very simple question.
[105:39.72]What is your class?
[105:41.85]I'm under fire.
[105:45.11]Well, you're the scout.
[105:49.86]No.
[105:52.50]I'm surrounded by fucking soundboards today.
[105:55.58]I'm surrounded by soundboards.
[105:57.67]Hey guys, what's up?
[106:02.59]Alright, I'm the drill guy.
[106:06.41]I don't know if you're doing this too.
[106:08.01]I don't know if you're capping him and then playing it.
[106:09.75]I don't know if you're doing this too.
[106:10.83]What do you mean what am I talking about?
[106:13.41]Do you have any idea what's happening right now?
[106:14.91]He's not here.
[106:15.25]He's not here.
[106:15.65]But he's not here.
[106:16.21]We're being manipulated.
[106:32.49]You died again
[107:02.31]Oh my god.
[107:03.03]I fucking... I fucking... Can you help us?
[107:09.30]Yes.
[107:14.52]Oh look, it's a Fortnite orc!
[107:20.36]We're gonna be fine!
[107:21.44]There's like a coffee pasta in my ear!
[107:23.71]I can't understand!
[107:31.29]What?
[107:32.59]Hey guys, what's up?
[107:33.55]I don't know who's talking.
[107:36.49]Everyone is talking!
[107:38.11]I'm gonna kill y'all!
[107:42.50]Was it coffee pasta?
[107:45.80]Can you heal me?
[107:46.52]Watch out!
[107:47.92]Whoa!
[107:51.78]Come on, Italic.
[107:54.78]He's just standing here.
[107:56.59]No shit.
[107:57.59]Eh, maybe.
[108:01.55]I'm so confused right now.
[108:14.46]Alright, let me... You definitely are mapping this right now.
[108:18.92]You're freaking out.
[108:20.11]He's like, I gotta pressure to get it mapped quick.
[108:22.87]There's too much going on.
[108:23.91]I don't even know who to shoot first.
[108:26.07]Yes.
[108:32.17]Is anyone playing this game?
[108:35.77]I'm gonna die.
[108:36.67]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[108:41.28]I need to go back.
[108:59.76]I had a Ronnie soundboard, too.
[109:01.88]Oh, did you really?
[109:02.56]I don't have it.
[109:04.32]I checked.
[109:05.52]I, like, didn't save any of them.
[109:10.03]Alright, we need to get the moor kite, which is the blue, the navy blue stuff on the sides.
[109:16.93]I'm not sure how I feel about that.
[109:21.97]Should we just kill him?
[109:23.67]I mean, like, we should probably just kill him.
[109:25.51]Like, I got my sights on him right now.
[109:27.91]Don't do it.
[109:30.00]I'm not sure he's fired the gun.
[109:34.88]Well, he doesn't need to.
[109:38.84]This is easy.
[109:39.42]We're only in Hazard 4.
[109:41.15]Oh, it's time to fight the boss.
[109:44.59]Wait, that was a real voice.
[109:47.51]That's not...
[110:00.99]Look, okay, I'm hitting left bumper.
[110:02.57]This is what's happening.
[110:05.67]He's on a controller.
[110:08.68]That's why.
[110:09.20]Okay, I need some sugar.
[110:22.05]I need some sugar right now.
[110:24.91]I'm not sure he's fired the gun.
[110:31.93]Alright.
[110:32.45]Whoa!
[110:33.29]Something.
[110:34.35]Something.
[110:38.89]Yes.
[110:39.51]Oh, you're killing the, you're killing the, the, the... The brain?
[110:42.42]The thing.
[110:43.28]The brain.
[110:47.22]I, I stuck a bunch of needles in it.
[110:50.72]I'm gonna duck.
[110:51.48]There's a little spider.
[110:54.50]I'm trying to take a game that we played together seriously for once and all you want to do is stop and make jokes.
[111:02.65]Seriously, I've been looking forward to playing this game for like two months.
[111:10.16]You really have wanted to play this for a long time too.
[111:12.78]And now all I get are these jokers in here.
[111:15.16]No.
[111:15.74]I didn't do anything.
[111:18.26]I'm the one that's playing the game right now.
[111:22.59]Is there a kill feed?
[111:25.99]No.
[111:27.89]How could this game not have a kill feed?
[111:37.56]Hey, I need to be right back real quick.
[111:39.34]Oh, there's crunchies over here.
[111:44.51]Come get some.
[111:47.43]Gold.
[111:54.55]Also, this is where Scout gets really useful.
[111:56.35]It wasn't someone playing Scout.
[111:57.61]Are we all dead?
[111:58.81]Yeah.
[111:59.43]You're the only person that remains.
[112:00.37]We all suck.
[112:03.65]Who's in this hole?
[112:06.87]Oh, he's stuck to the... I'm dead.
[112:10.61]Wait, wait.
[112:12.17]He's alive.
[112:12.57]No, he's not.
[112:13.81]No, he's not.
[112:14.75]Can we just play the game?
[112:18.23]It really pisses me off when people accuse me of lying.
[112:25.89]Should I go into his room and turn it off?
[112:38.74]Go into his room and cut his mic.
[112:40.60]Eh, maybe.
[112:51.16]I should unplug his router.
[112:52.82]I'm gonna go unplug his router.
[112:56.48]Guys, that's my router too.
[112:59.56]That's not how... I can't do that.
[113:03.24]Okay, we're going in again.
[113:07.09]I need full focus.
[113:10.73]From everyone.
[113:11.43]Alright, let me just buy some stuff first.
[113:13.59]I'm taking this one dead seriously.
[113:15.75]But I can afford something.
[113:17.85]No, I can't.
[113:18.57]I need to level up.
[113:21.60]There we go.
[113:22.76]Flare lasts longer.
[113:23.88]Sure, I'll take it.
[113:26.16]Thought that was another soundboard.
[113:27.54]I am so fucking paranoid about everything being a soundboard that I don't know.
[113:33.71]What?
[113:33.97]What's there to be paranoid about?
[113:36.30]I don't know.
[113:37.14]You tell me.
[113:37.52]I'm gonna go unplug his router.
[113:41.01]Wait, am I going alone?
[113:42.57]What?
[113:46.80]You were more concerned about fucking doing that stupid soundboard.
[113:52.92]And now- Wait, I think we're good.
[113:54.94]Yeah, I think I brought everybody, but I was worried because I was in the ship alone and I just saw myself dropping.
[114:01.32]I'm gonna go- I'm fucking- I'm not sure he's fired the gun.
[114:09.75]Hey guys, what's up?
[114:10.99]Oh my fucking god.
[114:15.53]I can't... I can't take this.
[114:17.97]Are you drill guy?
[114:21.37]I am drill... I've been drill guy.
[114:23.15]I'm always drill guy.
[114:24.36]It's a drill wall.
[114:25.36]Drill wall.
[114:28.82]You gotta find the thing.
[114:30.20]Oh, I'm looking for the purples.
[114:32.06]That's one thing I'm doing.
[114:38.11]Right?
[114:39.29]I don't see any...
[114:42.49]Huh, maybe I'm wrong.
[114:43.32]Are you down?
[114:43.94]Yeah, I think this might just be a common rock area.
[114:47.92]Is it down?
[114:48.90]I don't know.
[114:50.92]I don't think this might be one.
[114:52.38]I don't know.
[114:55.34]I don't see anything.
[114:57.30]What the heck is this?
[115:03.68]I don't know.
[115:06.62]I don't think I've been to this environment.
[115:09.87]Maybe I have.
[115:11.75]A long time ago.
[115:12.35]What about these?
[115:12.69]What about the blue?
[115:16.39]Okay.
[115:16.87]We got to get more kite.
[115:19.53]Yeah.
[115:20.15]Yep.
[115:24.02]Stop singing.
[115:26.48]One mission is all I ask.
[115:32.35]You're going home soon.
[115:33.35]You're not going to be able to play again.
[115:34.59]I'm going to miss you, dude.
[115:41.28]Thank God.
[115:42.44]Jolly Rancher.
[115:44.92]Alright.
[115:45.80]Cut his mic!
[115:53.08]Cut his mic!
[115:54.89]This way, friends.
[116:04.55]There's two scouts, both yelling in different directions.
[116:13.18]Oh, maybe I shouldn't be following the scout that's standing still in the wall.
[116:17.51]Press control.
[116:18.33]That's the pro tip.
[116:30.12]I go into his room.
[116:30.98]And he's not even in there.
[116:34.49]Hold on a second.
[116:52.13]He's not in his room.
[116:56.07]He's not at his desk.
[116:57.45]There's nobody there.
[116:58.21]Hey guys, what's up?
[117:05.87]Are you controlling him?
[117:06.87]Are you... No.
[117:12.63]Where am I?
[117:15.65]No one is... Can we please... Please.
[117:19.21]Over here.
[117:19.63]Gamers.
[117:24.21]Alright, let's go.
[117:28.81]We would go up.
[117:29.23]What do you want to go through?
[117:38.06]Drill not working.
[117:38.90]Oh, there's a bug you're getting caught on.
[117:46.53]Can we please, Jerma?
[117:48.21]I can't drill through this.
[117:49.51]This isn't funny, Jerma.
[117:50.70]Dude, it's not my fault that the Etalyx is at like a McDonald's Wi-Fi right now pretending that he's here.
[117:55.56]I can't go through this.
[117:57.52]I can't go through this.
[117:58.52]Don't waste your ammunition.
[118:00.59]Use your fucking pick.
[118:02.03]Your history.
[118:09.49]I'm so sick of Goose.
[118:14.56]Alright, we can move!
[118:16.46]Oh!
[118:17.56]Acid!
[118:18.12]Acid pool!
[118:19.16]Acid pool!
[118:20.42]Acid pool!
[118:21.82]Acid pool!
[118:23.22]Acid pool!
[118:25.89]What is it?
[118:30.21]Hey, can I get a closer look?
[118:31.57]Lots of them coming your way.
[118:33.13]Get ready.
[118:44.50]This would be a lot easier if we had a driller.
[118:46.98]I... You saw what happened to me.
[118:49.44]I drilled and fell down through into an acid pool.
[118:53.33]I told you... I thought you said... You died again?
[118:55.13]I thought you told me that there was no Minecraft, like, dig down into the lava scenarios in this game.
[119:00.75]That just happened.
[119:02.20]I lied.
[119:02.62]Can we get some... Can we get some support?
[119:14.60]There's a bunch of flesh-colored spiders on me.
[119:18.36]I can't fucking take it anymore.
[119:21.60]I can't take it anymore.
[119:25.74]Hey guys, what's up?
[119:27.28]Okay, I've been live for two hours.
[119:28.44]I feel like I've been live for 40.
[119:33.53]I burned another bridge.
[119:36.09]I'm under fire.
[119:39.07]I don't think I'm going to play with him anymore.
[119:43.52]I checked he wasn't in the other room.
[119:51.09]He simulated.
[119:52.49]I don't want to play with Star anymore, man.
[119:53.87]They're all after me.
[119:55.49]He fucking simulated one of my friends.
[120:05.63]Shut up.
[120:11.65]I didn't know we were all dead.
[120:12.75]Can we...
[120:14.61]I need a recording of Vitalik saying, like, I'm down.
[120:16.89]I'm going to scour hours of YouTube content.
[120:29.09]Hey, I'm pinned down over here.
[120:33.58]Are you even playing?
[120:34.36]Okay, that one will work.
[120:35.56]Alright, we're doing it again.
[120:38.72]That'll work.
[120:39.22]That'll work.
[120:55.49]Well, not time to leave.
[120:56.19]I need to upgrade my equipment.
[120:58.53]I need to get better drills.
[120:59.52]Barb drills!
[121:18.49]Barb drills.
[121:19.05]Alright, who has the worst computer?
[121:23.81]Right now, it's a tight race between Lemonlaw and Ronnie.
[121:32.69]Oh!
[121:33.69]I was gonna say, every time that it's quiet for like 15 to 20 straight seconds, it means that like the two soundboard boys are queuing up more.
[121:46.58]What?
[121:48.62]Every time you guys are quiet for more than 10 seconds, it means that like here comes more sound effects.
[121:55.27]Yes.
[121:56.91]Yes.
[121:58.39]No.
[121:59.23]I'm breaking out.
[122:01.01]I'm breaking free.
[122:04.03]This chip was in my neck.
[122:05.25]It was a computer chip in my neck.
[122:10.97]It's blood.
[122:12.63]Can we all just ignore the blood for like one second and get a drill guy over on the dirt?
[122:17.87]I'm a drill guy.
[122:19.02]What do you need?
[122:20.10]What does drill mean?
[122:21.84]What?
[122:24.41]Who the fuck was that?
[122:31.42]Did you turn Etalyx into another person?
[122:35.74]Good times.
[122:37.22]Bad times.
[122:41.44]What does drill mean?
[122:44.42]Noice up!
[122:46.32]Where do you- I can't have Etalyx.
[122:48.30]I'll just replace him.
[122:49.03]Alright, I've been- Get through- Alright, here we go.
[122:56.78]I thought there was more cut.
[123:06.26]Bugs!
[123:11.29]I can't tell if that was a soundboard or if somebody actually just hurt themself.
[123:15.99]Ow!
[123:19.83]The stream doesn't feel real.
[123:22.87]I'm not sure he's fired the gun.
[123:26.41]I know.
[123:28.03]I'm right there with you.
[123:29.81]It's so messed up when you get cut off from talking by yourself.
[123:33.83]It's like you can't finish your thought.
[123:35.57]I can't finish my sentence because I'm cutting myself off.
[123:39.55]And it was so funny because it was like, it feels like you're so polite, you can't interrupt yourself.
[123:43.73]You like give yourself the time to talk.
[123:45.87]That's not even real.
[123:50.46]Four.
[123:59.91]Wait, what's the dog?
[124:03.19]Is somebody a dog?
[124:04.31]Where were you?
[124:05.45]You weren't even in there.
[124:06.43]I just went in there.
[124:06.95]Were you in the bathroom?
[124:33.32]Guys, if we fail this mission, I'm going to scream.
[124:36.48]Oh, fail it immediately.
[124:37.36]Fail it, fail it, fail it.
[124:37.98]I want to hear him scream as loud as he can.
[124:39.92]Just blow yourself up or something.
[124:41.48]Help, help, help.
[124:43.56]I have no idea how to play this game.
[124:45.24]Alright, so pretty much how it works is... I failed the tutorial.
[124:48.71]It's LFD2, but it's with dwarves.
[124:56.63]LFD2.
[124:59.55]Where are you?
[124:59.89]LFD2?
[125:02.77]Where are you, Star?
[125:04.19]Looking for dead.
[125:05.73]Where are you, Star?
[125:06.39]Where are you?
[125:08.09]Hello!
[125:09.59]Found him.
[125:09.93]Oh, hey.
[125:11.83]There's a pearl on there.
[125:14.03]Pearl?
[125:14.25]But you need to upgrade your character.
[125:16.65]I can't get in there?
[125:18.43]You need a drill.
[125:19.73]I have a drill.
[125:21.13]What does drill mean?
[125:22.55]I'll get in there.
[125:23.03]I feel like you're on a secret mission to kill me right now.
[125:30.99]I thought you said there's a pearl in here.
[125:33.38]There is.
[125:35.16]You gotta keep digging around till you find it.
[125:38.76]Not that way.
[125:40.02]Over here.
[125:47.92]Found it!
[125:50.66]Did I blow it up?
[125:51.92]I got it.
[125:52.34]No, you gotta bring it to the thing.
[125:54.20]Ow.
[125:55.12]Alright, where's the thing?
[126:04.50]I'm gonna die.
[126:06.70]Protect the guy with the money.
[126:10.38]I'm the mo- Okay, now it's gonna roll down the cliff.
[126:15.15]He dead again?
[126:16.33]Yes, I'm the one holding the disco ball and nobody's- That's my line.
[126:19.43]You can't say that.
[126:23.35]He's gonna scream.
[126:24.31]He's gonna scream.
[126:24.81]This is perfect.
[126:29.08]We're all dead?
[126:36.21]Oh, that's weak!
[126:37.57]Weak!
[126:38.63]Weak scream!
[126:59.18]Someone just said, what's wrong with you?
[127:00.66]That's not me doing that!
[127:04.81]I'm not doing that.
[127:06.23]That's not me screaming.
[127:08.27]Let's just get back into it and forget this as quickly as possible.
[127:18.18]It's like I have a radio frequency.
[127:21.73]OK.
[127:22.53]I got to explain what this is.
[127:23.97]I got to stop.
[127:25.85]It's a radio.
[127:26.57]I got a radio frequency.
[127:29.48]And I'm turning around looking for, like, the news.
[127:31.84]And I pick up, like, hell.
[127:34.72]And I'm like, all out of it.
[127:36.47]Like, never mind.
[127:40.41]Sounds like a whoopee cushion.
[127:42.29]Let's go again.
[127:42.85]Alright, do we give up and not do the hard mode?
[127:48.75]No.
[127:49.71]Hard mode.
[127:51.77]Alright.
[127:52.65]No, we do hard mode.
[127:54.03]Alright, so actual question.
[127:56.17]I don't know how to change character.
[127:58.53]You go into your pod with your name on it.
[128:03.09]Oh.
[128:04.59]You know what?
[128:04.95]Atox doesn't even know how to play.
[128:05.97]We're doing Hazard 3.
[128:08.49]You should have explained it.
[128:09.33]Ooh, sorry.
[128:12.53]It was all fun and games a second ago.
[128:13.99]I can't wait to hear him scream and now... Hold on, that's not the news.
[128:19.39]That's like the ghost realm.
[128:20.73]Hold on, let me... What class do we actually need now?
[128:25.94]Uh, we need... Anything.
[128:27.80]I mean, like, we're fine.
[128:29.38]Be, like, the gunner.
[128:30.48]Like, the machine gunner.
[128:31.53]Actually, anything other than Scout would be great.
[128:36.13]Metallix is actually here.
[128:37.53]Yeah, we recorded this video, like, three years ago.
[128:40.11]Oh, wait.
[128:40.35]Hold on, everybody.
[128:40.93]Hold on.
[128:42.17]I want to start a new video for this, um... What do you mean, a new video?
[128:45.83]Three, two...
[128:48.53]Hey, everybody.
[128:49.29]What's going on?
[128:50.09]Ster here.

[128:52.85]Pretty cool.
[128:53.41]I've got a couple of my friends in the call.
[128:55.15]We've got Lemonlaw, Stixon, and Ronnie.
[128:57.86]Could you say hello?
[128:58.58]Hey, guys.
[128:59.00]What's up?
[128:59.56]Hey, what's happening?
[129:02.60]Ronnie is not in the call.
[129:04.22]Ronnie, you're...
[129:06.29]I'm cutting it.
[129:06.87]No, just start it again.
[129:08.51]Hold on.
[129:10.09]I'm still going, so let me do my intro.
[129:11.91]I'll just change it, you know what I mean?
[129:16.08]We'll count it and I'll restart.
[129:17.88]Can you shut the fuck up and let me do my thing?
[129:19.56]Because, like, you know, I let you do your thing, so let me do mine.
[129:24.21]Okay, fine.
[129:25.01]I don't- Like, is this gonna be in the video, though?
[129:26.89]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[129:27.71]Like, I am gonna- I'm just saying, like, when we do intros, we do three of them.
[129:31.79]Because, what, it's your video?
[129:33.75]No, it's fucking- There's eight of us here making a video.
[129:36.53]So we're all gonna be able to- Sync it to the load screen.
[129:39.25]That would be cool.
[129:39.75]Like, you start, like, right as we're landing.
[129:41.51]No, that's what's gonna happen.
[129:42.25]But, like, there's this fucking eight of us in this call.
[129:43.87]We're all gonna have an intro.
[129:44.69]Can you shut the fuck up?

[130:18.70]Wow, if you could all smash that like button.
[130:24.80]Dude, I'd be so good at this.

[130:40.93]Alright, everybody, we're going to need to collect... Oh, they're bombs.

[132:35.39]You ever think about the environment?
[132:37.75]Above.
[132:37.95]It's supposed to take all a moment to tell you guys about Dollar Shave Club.
[132:47.04]You just did.
[132:47.58]That's the thing.
[132:48.20]You just did.
[132:48.66]I mean, you make that joke, but you just did that for free.
[132:53.98]So?
[132:54.68]Tell me more.
[132:59.67]You ever buy a $1 razor?
[133:02.73]Yeah, use that on your face.
[133:05.75]Have fun.
[133:19.23]One dollar.
[133:22.57]Well, one dollar razor.
[133:24.08]I call that a ship.
[133:26.86]It's just a knife.
[133:30.62]They just send you like a piece of glass.
[133:33.42]Hey, try this out.
[133:35.44]What's going on with your voice?
[133:37.52]What's happening?
[133:38.70]What do you mean?
[133:39.12]I don't know.
[133:40.28]Something's weird.
[133:43.84]See, I do comedy skits now, so every once in a while I go and do a different character.
[133:48.85]Oh, no.
[133:49.15]It's the compressor.
[133:49.99]Right, right, right.
[133:50.49]You have the professional thing.
[133:51.63]Yeah, if I scream, then it'll start off lower and try and compensate for how much I'm... Yeah, you have one of those things that makes your voice go like this.
[134:02.43]I don't have time.
[134:09.01]Was that the Jorah Mormont voice?
[134:11.83]I mean, it could be.
[134:14.13]Kind of.
[134:14.89]Hey, no spoilers.
[134:17.91]No spoilers.
[134:18.65]That's how he talks.
[134:20.87]I haven't gotten to that part yet.
[134:22.53]You haven't gotten to the part where Jorah Mormont talks?
[134:25.07]Well, you haven't seen... You're on, like, episode four of the first season.
[134:29.16]Okay.
[134:30.75]What?
[134:30.93]He doesn't show up in season four.
[134:32.57]Can I get some help?
[134:38.97]Yeah, he's in the first episode.
[134:42.19]What?
[134:42.37]He's the one that falls out the window?
[134:45.55]You're trekking on kind of uncharted ground here.
[134:51.07]Be careful here.
[134:52.69]Careful what?
[134:54.79]I'm the one that doesn't want the spoilers.
[135:09.95]Where is everybody?
[135:11.03]We're going, like, up.
[135:13.93]In the worst possible way.
[135:15.17]Oh, you stuck all the way right below me.
[135:17.86]Did I?
[135:18.44]That was a funny moment.
[135:19.56]That's going in the montage.
[135:21.50]No, no, no.
[135:22.54]That's my clip.
[135:23.14]That's my video.
[135:25.32]Please.
[135:25.82]No.
[135:26.00]Please, I need that.
[135:27.08]I just need to fill this out.
[135:28.22]I'm so close to ten minutes.
[135:29.84]No, you got, like, the funny, like, scream ghost of a frequency thing.
[135:33.10]I get this.
[135:36.35]Fine.
[135:37.03]Thanks.
[135:38.87]But I get the dollar shave club.
[135:41.25]Alright, homie.
[135:42.93]I get Etalyx.
[135:43.71]Sorry, are we role-playing right now?
[135:45.37]Are we pretending like we still make YouTube content?
[135:47.74]I do.
[135:47.96]What the fuck, man?
[135:52.24]I do.
[135:53.86]I do once every three years.
[135:56.32]And they are not Spider-Man 3 Let's Plays.
[135:59.69]That's too bad.
[136:00.53]You're missing out.
[136:00.97]Is that why GTA 5 is so popular right now?
[136:07.82]I don't know.
[136:08.10]Because it takes you back to the yesteryears in 2015 when things were good.
[136:11.74]I think just GTA RP is fun and people like it.
[136:19.14]So where to?
[136:21.32]You missed a secret.
[136:22.82]I did?
[136:23.96]Yeah, my game's just laggy computer.
[136:25.82]Watch out, bot!
[136:29.29]Are you down?
[136:31.01]No.
[136:31.65]Down here, there's a drillable.
[136:34.09]There's a drillable down there?
[136:35.87]Yeah.
[136:38.31]Where's that at?
[136:38.83]Right here?
[136:40.95]I got it.
[136:44.33]Ah, it's not there.
[136:49.25]It's not here.
[136:49.89]Not over here.
[136:50.93]Swarm.
[136:57.53]Swarm.
[136:58.85]Swarm.
[137:08.59]What the hell is this thing?
[137:13.19]Oh god.
[137:17.03]Can you just drill like a straight line so we can retreat?
[137:20.48]Please.
[137:20.88]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[137:24.50]You're going through like toxic gas.
[137:26.74]What?
[137:26.98]There's a hole.
[137:41.12]Okay, I got an escape, huh?
[137:45.91]That was some teamwork.
[137:47.07]I'm using this clip.
[137:48.09]If you got the last one, I'm getting this one.
[137:50.11]But that was me doing that, though.
[137:51.91]My perspective is more interesting.
[137:53.87]Because I'm the one drilling.
[137:56.07]What's this for my review?
[138:00.67]Uh, I need help.
[138:09.05]Are we dead?
[138:18.76]Some of you look dead.
[138:20.72]I think.
[138:22.56]We are dead.
[138:24.81]I'll get you guys, don't worry.
[138:27.36]Well, you told me to drill a hole and they just kind of filled the hole.
[138:30.65]Well, Etalyx didn't come with us because he was too busy making jokes.
[138:34.69]First of all, I was with somebody.
[138:36.25]So if I was with somebody, then that means two of us.
[138:39.40]You were with Ronnie and Ronnie can't hear what we're saying.
[138:44.32]Oh, right.
[138:45.40]Is that why he's been yelling for help in the chat?
[138:48.79]Ronnie can't hear us.
[138:50.70]Is that why he wrote help ten times in the chat?
[138:53.28]Yes, that's why.
[138:55.16]To anyone watching this YouTube video, please help.
[138:57.70]How do I teabag?
[138:58.41]No!
[138:58.53]No!
[138:58.65]I'm dead.
[139:02.73]I'm down again.
[139:23.20]That's okay.
[139:26.21]I'm gaming.
[139:27.05]Did you, reviving me, give you TAMP a handful of times to run away while I absorbed everybody?
[139:34.19]Well, this is what Scout's good at.
[139:38.14]You can read more about it in the review.
[139:47.88]Just gonna, like, not revive Jerma this time.
[139:51.65]You revived me and ran away while, like, ten bugs attacked me!
[139:57.76]Uh, I can't shoot.
[140:03.12]Hey, add ammo.
[140:04.20]We might need to get a supply crate.
[140:10.65]Uh... I don't have enough nitro, I don't think.
[140:15.59]Thank you for using the sprinkles on me.
[140:18.20]But if you have nitro, please deposit it, because we are very close to the allotted amount required to call in the drop pod, which is going to supply you with additional ammo.
[140:28.66]Right.
[140:28.92]Well, we're going to find this pearl, don't we?
[140:32.44]Was that before or after the DLC?
[140:35.87]Probably.
[140:38.19]It's actually entirely start to finish, free to play.
[140:44.29]That's not true.
[140:45.07]This game's like 30 bucks.
[140:46.89]Hey, I'm just a YouTuber.
[140:48.03]I don't got to be actually accurate.
[140:51.25]Hey guys, check out Deep Rock Galactic.
[140:53.75]If you're a tuber, you can just email the publisher and they'll send you it for free.
[140:57.19]So that's how I got it.
[140:59.89]And if you're not, just pretend to be.
[141:07.13]Found it.
[141:08.75]Where is it?
[141:10.59]What?
[141:11.00]Where is it?
[141:11.72]I just heard it.
[141:13.90]Can we please turn in some nitrate?
[141:16.97]I just heard the thing break.
[141:17.79]Oh, it's right there.
[141:24.21]A nitrate.
[141:25.33]Whatever.
[141:25.91]Wait, where the hell is it?
[141:26.93]Don't correct me.
[141:28.71]Don't fact check me.
[141:30.21]Oh, you got it.
[141:30.99]Alright, dump it.
[141:34.97]What do I do with this?
[141:36.51]We gotta get the supply wagon thing.
[141:38.35]Come here.
[141:43.70]You're gonna put it in this thing and we get some... stuff.
[141:46.70]Wait, where are you going?
[141:47.96]Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?
[141:48.86]Get back here!
[141:49.86]Me?
[141:50.54]No, no, no.
[141:50.92]The stupid thing.
[141:51.86]Oh, it might be following me.
[141:54.77]Press C. I did.
[141:58.23]Enemies!
[142:01.45]Aw, shit.
[142:02.39]Aw, shit!
[142:04.91]Aw, shit!
[142:06.69]Aw, shit!
[142:15.23]That's as much as I can do.
[142:27.61]I swear.
[142:29.77]I do.
[142:32.03]Turn it in!
[142:34.75]Turn it in!
[142:37.81]Where?
[142:38.07]Right there.
[142:39.30]There it is.
[142:41.94]Inside the moving loot crate.
[142:44.82]Alright.
[142:45.92]I dinked it.
[142:50.07]There's a, uh, over here on the yellow thing, there is a device that comes out that gives you extra money.
[143:03.49]I get this clip!
[143:05.65]No, that's mine.
[143:06.89]I'm the one that did it.
[143:10.09]If you put that in your video, I'm going to be fucking really mad.
[143:12.63]Don't do that.
[143:13.59]I made that funny joke, and I dropped it on him, and I did the funny ee-haw ee-haw thing.
[143:17.97]I would hate to get my lawyers involved in this one.
[143:21.47]Ready to kill some more creeps.
[143:26.55]And here, ladies and gentlemen, we have the prelude to what would ultimately become recording without telling the people you're playing with that you're recording so that no clips would need be shared and all would belong to the clipper.
[143:41.03]That's a pretty good strategy, actually.
[143:45.37]Natalix, did you level up your inside of your weapon to be able to shoot things out of it?
[143:52.98]What?
[143:53.46]Did you get ammo?
[143:55.60]Did you?
[143:56.40]Did you get ammo?
[143:59.76]Make sure you get ammo.
[144:01.42]I got ammo.
[144:02.18]Nice.
[144:02.74]Alright.
[144:03.04]Are you guys ready?
[144:03.58]I need ammo.
[144:04.30]Did we put the... Did you put the jade thing in there?
[144:13.66]What?
[144:14.46]Did you put the... We put the jade in there.
[144:16.10]The thing that... The secret gem in the wall.
[144:22.85]The secret gem that we dug out of the wall was put in the supply drop.
[144:26.95]Right?
[144:27.13]Am I following somebody who's good at this game?
[144:29.13]You following me?
[144:29.73]Then... Oh, so the answer is no.
[144:31.93]No, the answer is... Yeah.
[144:34.33]The heck is this?
[144:36.48]We're looking for... The blue.
[144:39.08]The navy blue.
[144:40.44]Oh, by the way, hit F if you want to throw out a... Some blight.
[144:44.95]You can just do that.
[144:46.03]Hey.
[144:46.27]Can you see where... Press control.
[144:49.31]Driller.
[144:50.48]Control.
[144:50.78]And dig over to where I am.
[144:51.98]Press... The mouse button is a grenade.
[144:53.64]You need me to do... You need me to dig... Dig spot.
[144:56.72]Yeah, just dig straight to me.
[145:09.13]Guys, what is he doing?
[145:10.67]I'm digging to you.
[145:11.47]I'm seeing Fs in the chat.
[145:15.19]What do you mean F?
[145:19.27]This is some Red Faction 1 stuff we're doing right here.
[145:22.24]Why would this be F?
[145:23.30]I want to replay that.
[145:24.16]One of these days.
[145:25.82]You're just really far away.
[145:26.74]Not that far.
[145:29.60]20 meters for a drill guy.
[145:31.38]I can't overheat this.
[145:33.52]I'm right above you.
[145:40.33]Hey, I made it.
[145:41.45]Okay.
[145:42.95]There's the hole.
[145:44.25]I don't know where we're going, but a swarm's coming.
[145:45.87]Oh, that actually worked.
[145:49.02]Press F. He doesn't know.
[145:50.42]I don't understand.
[145:53.56]What do we not know?
[145:57.66]I think... Where's Ronnie?
[145:59.77]What do we not know?
[146:00.57]I'm asking Chet.
[146:01.87]What do we not know?
[146:02.69]Yeah, what do we not know?
[146:10.82]I think we know everything we need to know.
[146:12.30]That's why half these people are still in school.
[146:14.70]They don't.
[146:17.97]It's 2 o'clock.
[146:19.41]What are you talking about?
[146:30.21]Sorry, are you in face cam?
[146:35.23]Sometime.
[146:36.51]Are you on face cam now?
[146:38.05]No.
[146:40.96]Nevermind.
[146:42.70]Why?
[146:43.42]Nah, nevermind.
[146:44.54]You were gonna ask me to take my shirt off again, weren't you?
[146:46.36]Something in the water.
[146:58.02]I could just snipe Ronnie.
[147:00.16]That was me.
[147:02.49]Um, we're like in trouble here.
[147:04.61]Yeah?
[147:06.53]What, you've never been in trouble before?
[147:11.70]I'm dead.
[147:11.98]Holy shit, there's so many of these things.
[147:13.22]It's up to you.
[147:18.81]Oh, dude, I'm gonna die right now.
[147:20.25]No, you're not.
[147:20.69]No, you're not.
[147:21.05]You'll be fine.
[147:22.01]Oh!
[147:22.15]You'll be fine.
[147:24.57]I'm out of ammo.
[147:33.22]What?
[147:33.48]There are so many of those.
[147:38.74]Just grapple around.
[147:41.50]We got so much of that ore over here.
[147:43.26]This would be so bad if you lose this.
[147:45.72]Come on, man.
[147:46.24]You're like one of the top players.
[147:51.42]Show us again why everyone considers you to be like the good gamer.
[147:58.26]I got no ammo.
[148:07.60]You don't have any ammo at all.
[148:08.98]Zero.
[148:10.41]I've got four shots left.
[148:13.11]Make them count.
[148:13.61]Two.
[148:18.97]They're all cramming up this hole.
[148:20.27]I don't remember which way to actually go.
[148:21.55]This is the wrong way.
[148:36.02]Holy shit, you can go very far with that thing, huh?
[148:38.99]I'm getting EDF flashbacks right now.
[148:40.49]I have it upgraded pretty far.
[148:41.49]Yeah, this is like EDF.
[148:43.61]They're trying to revive us.
[148:44.79]There's the hole.
[148:56.01]What are those, like, Deku nuts coming out of your, like, face when you fly?
[149:00.30]What are those Deku nuts?
[149:05.89]Oh, it's your beard.
[149:06.57]Never mind.
[149:09.33]Dude, I'm lost.
[149:10.91]Here, look.
[149:11.65]Do you need a guide?
[149:18.16]Just sneak over and revive.
[149:19.84]Just sneak through.
[149:20.78]That tunnel is my tunnel.
[149:21.84]That's my clip.
[149:24.86]Shut up.
[149:26.66]I'm copyright claiming your whole channel.
[149:31.91]Oh, Castle Griffin seat?
[149:33.29]I hold the copyright.
[149:35.69]Is that supposed to be some kind of monetary threat?
[149:39.55]On a platform where no money exists?
[149:41.94]Here's the dumbest thing about YouTube.
[149:43.90]You could probably fucking get away with that.
[149:46.94]Somehow.
[149:49.48]I'm from LLC Limited for a company from South Florida.
[149:55.73]And I own that song.
[149:57.37]The video's mine.
[149:58.39]You could probably do that.
[149:59.57]And like get away with it.
[150:01.83]Had a video claim it was like Scout can upward live commentary Claimed by Mortal Kombat dude.
[150:11.54]There's like a thousand of those armored bugs over here.
[150:16.94]Yeah You know what we need is is more nitro though I
[150:30.55]Because I have no ammo.
[150:33.13]It's up to you again.
[150:35.24]You're all dead, fucking Stixxon!
[150:37.46]Yeah, we all got- you revived us instantly.
[150:40.08]I'm alive!
[150:40.58]He's alive!
[150:41.52]I'm dead.
[150:42.50]Yeah.
[150:43.68]I'm gonna be dead too.

[150:52.59]Five.
[150:53.29]Got it!
[151:00.56]I was just running around looking for nitros.
[151:02.14]Come on, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it.
[151:06.96]I got Ronnie.
[151:07.78]The relay has been passed, the baton's passed.
[151:10.32]One, two, three, four, five.
[151:12.81]Got it, nice.
[151:13.63]Oh my God.
[151:14.53]You're up, you're up.
[151:15.25]I'll make sure, I'm counting to five for you.
[151:18.73]I'm coming to five for you.
[151:20.33]One, four, five.
[151:25.15]Alright, no, no, no, no, no.
[151:27.51]Let's do this smart.
[151:29.06]This is not the time to do this.
[151:30.48]You want to do this level again?
[151:31.70]No, you don't.
[151:32.52]There's dirt down there.
[151:33.36]What do you mean, dirt down there?
[151:54.45]Where are you?
[151:54.89]I mean, over there.
[151:56.67]Compact dirt that leads to the next area.
[151:58.87]We need to get through because there's, like, no nitro here.
[152:03.67]How did you get down there?
[152:07.38]How did I get down there?
[152:09.38]Star, where the hell are you?
[152:10.40]Weren't you just right with me?
[152:11.92]Oh, you fly around like a dickhead.
[152:13.92]I forgot.
[152:14.64]Like a dickhead.
[152:15.74]I'm just drilling down.
[152:17.32]Wow.
[152:24.98]Am I going the right way?
[152:25.68]Star.
[152:29.88]No, you're not.
[152:31.26]There's another sea worm?
[152:37.81]He's like a dickhead.
[152:41.20]I hear something.
[152:43.14]You're going the complete opposite way.
[152:58.96]Die!
[153:03.18]I'm with you.
[153:04.06]Let's do this.
[153:04.48]Let's do this lemon law.
[153:05.88]I'm going to die.
[153:07.12]I'm going to die.
[153:07.62]I'm going to die.
[153:08.14]Do you have ammo?
[153:09.98]A little bit.
[153:16.11]Here, lure him into this explosion.
[153:17.79]Alright.
[153:20.11]I'm up here.
[153:20.85]I'm here.
[153:21.11]I'm here.
[153:21.37]I'm here.
[153:21.69]I'm here.
[153:21.99]I'm here.
[153:22.29]I'm here.
[153:22.57]Alright.
[153:22.85]Dude, explode.
[153:23.35]Studio quality voice acting for these characters' sound effects.
[153:26.81]Whoa.
[153:27.13]Let's watch out, man.
[153:31.77]Torch it!
[153:33.33]Where'd you go?
[153:34.51]Shout!
[153:36.19]Shout!
[153:36.83]I'm going down this path.
[153:44.43]Looking for nitrous.
[153:49.24]Real question, how come one of these games hasn't done like a voice pack like that?
[153:54.64]Like what?
[153:57.10]You know, non-serious like tuber boys.
[153:59.62]You mean like
[154:02.26]The Dota voice packs?
[154:04.00]Star... You mean like, Hi-Rez Smite?
[154:07.48]Star, where are... Hi-Rez Smite is, uh... Sorry, but did you want a voice pack?
[154:12.95]Um... Open the wallet and turn it upside down.
[154:16.55]Which one did you want?
[154:21.17]Star, where are you?
[154:25.04]I need to constantly know where you are.
[154:31.14]I'm running back to our friends you're going back you're going back there yeah alright I'm like above you I just want to circle
[155:01.20]Oh god.
[155:02.47]Can you dig up?
[155:03.11]Can you dig up for me?
[155:04.05]Can you dig up?
[155:05.61]Can you dig up?
[155:08.32]I'm dead.
[155:08.90]I'm dead too.
[155:11.08]I don't understand how there was only enough nitro to call in one supply drop for like the first three areas.
[155:28.23]what is it is we have four people so it's 400 more HP than 400 less resources yeah we have this dead weight ronnie's not even in the call why would you say that I feel like he's listening to all of the streams at once to see if anyone mentions him
[155:52.14]Well, he is communicating.
[155:52.82]Why don't you bring him in the call?
[155:54.20]He is communicating.
[155:55.08]He said BAD in all capitals.
[155:59.84]He did say BAD.
[156:04.62]Ooh.
[156:09.57]I need 15 silver coins.
[156:18.95]Let me see the other characters.
[156:25.22]Gunner engineer.
[156:27.44]Gunner.
[156:31.08]I'll stay with the drill.
[156:32.92]Noob driller?
[156:34.86]Is this the noob class?
[156:40.83]Whatever you pick.
[156:48.54]Not bad.
[156:54.28]I feel like this is how you dance in VR.
[156:59.93]You don't want to move around that much because you don't want to bump into your walls.
[157:08.03]You can't use your legs in VR.
[157:09.83]You actually can if you have trackers on them.
[157:23.54]Yeah, you just... They have the loops, like the Oculus controllers, you just stick your feet through the loop.
[157:29.34]And then you play with four controllers.
[157:34.63]Alright, are we ready to... This is... This is a pure gamer part of the level, okay?
[157:39.83]We haven't won anything since I've been here, so... I'll take responsibility.
[157:44.17]Yeah, congrats on level one.
[157:46.69]Yeah, I'm still level one.
[157:49.47]Remember when I said anything but Scout?
[157:52.63]I didn't, oh, I didn't pick that.
[157:58.05]I didn't even go into my ship.
[158:00.23]Some of those beards are so huge.
[158:03.11]That's just like, that's so much hair.
[158:10.53]I feel like I would trip on that here.
[158:13.47]Is there like a button in here that just takes us back to the base?
[158:15.85]No, we're winning this.
[158:18.74]Mine that.
[158:19.24]You got it.
[158:24.46]Does the drill work?
[158:33.50]Is it better, Miner?
[158:36.00]Someone... Okay, who's hosting this?
[158:38.58]Hosting what?
[158:40.65]Me?
[158:41.67]My computer freaks out every 10 minutes and then the game freaks out.
[158:44.69]Because I just lagged off the clip.
[158:46.59]Yeah, that's happening.
[158:47.87]That's my fault.
[158:48.55]Okay, I got the gold...
[158:57.88]Here we go.
[158:58.22]Okay, dig through the dirt.
[158:59.71]Dig through the dirt.
[159:00.53]Let's dig through this dirt.
[159:04.43]You gotta hustle.
[159:05.07]If you take too long, then there's a million things.
[159:08.57]Dig through the dirt.
[159:11.79]I just planned.
[159:12.41]Okay.
[159:13.49]Don't go through the dirt.
[159:14.23]Wait.
[159:14.45]Okay.
[159:21.55]We're through.
[159:26.20]I'm proud of you.
[159:27.32]Thanks, man.
[159:38.70]Okay.
[159:39.58]Lick me.
[159:40.92]What?
[159:41.56]Why do you always have to say something like that?
[159:49.17]Why can't you just say, like...
[159:52.59]I don't know something like charge me it's hard to think of something better to say right on the spot you can't even think of anything you're like why don't you say um well it's because I was looking at something yeah I'm not afraid to share what my desires are like some people that are so bottled up and taught by society that your home's supposed to you know not be licked but you do it anyway right
[160:24.96]I did.
[160:26.02]Alright, so now, where are we going?
[160:30.43]We need to extract.
[160:31.23]Alright, there's, uh, there's crusty stuff here.
[160:38.22]I'm gonna dump the, uh, gold and the, I got a lot of nitro and a lot of gold.
[160:44.88]Why, what's with this broken game?
[160:46.74]Okay, we're good.
[160:53.46]I want that, uh... Probably killed in one hit.
[160:59.55]Alright, we got a lot of gold in there.
[161:04.94]A lot of, uh, nitro.
[161:09.33]I'll scout ahead, as the class name implies.
[161:11.79]Hey, I'll come with you.
[161:13.44]Yeah, let's stick together.
[161:14.32]Stick together.
[161:14.70]There's no reason for us to split up.
[161:15.86]Yeah, right.
[161:17.60]Don't split up because you're the gamer star and you like to go forward really fast.
[161:21.96]That's what this class does.
[161:23.76]No, you're supposed to go back to back to back to back and just walk together.
[161:29.14]Look at us mining this together.
[161:30.37]Doesn't this feel good?
[161:32.83]It is fun.
[161:38.09]Alright, take my hand.
[161:39.49]Take my hand.
[161:42.21]Okay, let's go.
[161:43.63]Just make sure you keep your hands, our hands locked.
[161:48.35]Okay.
[161:49.37]What's Purple Rock?
[161:52.15]Suck on this, you freak!
[161:53.93]Purple Rock is... Help me mine this.
[161:56.36]Don't talk to him.
[161:57.66]I'm gonna talk to him, because he wants to know what's going on.
[162:00.30]Purple Rock is not with the group.
[162:01.34]Ronnie would be able to tell me if Ronnie were here.
[162:04.20]Oh my god, you do not want to talk to Ronnie.
[162:06.18]He's insufferable.
[162:10.22]Fuck.
[162:13.18]Why are you so rude?
[162:15.02]Always.
[162:22.73]I like these blue crystals.
[162:24.75]They light the place up.
[162:26.83]Where's this cheese?
[162:27.71]Come get the cheese.
[162:28.25]Come get the moldy cheese.
[162:32.09]Cheese.
[162:33.90]Oh, never mind.
[162:34.34]It's nothing.
[162:35.58]Is it nothing?
[162:36.56]It's dirt.
[162:37.42]Dirt.
[162:39.79]I have no idea what the purple stuff is.
[162:41.39]I don't think it's anything.
[162:43.19]That actually was just nothing.
[162:44.63]That actually... You have Ronnie's soundboard.
[162:46.71]That's a pretty good soundboard.
[162:48.17]That was very accurate.
[162:49.53]That's exactly the land we needed.
[162:51.59]Oh, Jerma, over here.
[162:57.76]Jeremy.
[162:59.00]I'm coming.
[162:59.36]I'm coming right here.
[162:59.96]Give me Zax.
[163:00.94]There's a lot of bugs.
[163:03.18]I probably wouldn't follow me, Etalyx.
[163:08.26]Oh, he's actually in the call.
[163:12.34]Oh, hey, Roni.
[163:12.96]Sorry.
[163:13.22]I thought I was being, like, manipulated.
[163:16.13]You thought I was simulating more people.
[163:17.77]Well, you are, but that's a different thing.
[163:21.71]Ah, jeez.
[163:22.11]They're way down there.
[163:23.25]I still don't see the... Wait, I think it's right here.
[163:31.72]I got it.
[163:32.02]I got it.
[163:34.70]Bring that thing.
[163:38.75]Thanks for taking my clip.
[163:42.11]That's what you just did.
[163:42.77]It's the equivalent of what you just did.
[163:45.44]No.
[163:47.04]Wait here.
[163:48.22]Okay.
[163:49.32]Okay, we can dig straight down to him.
[163:54.48]Okay.
[164:00.79]Here, you're above us.
[164:02.93]Here, I got you.
[164:03.95]We got a hell of a blip heading your way, team.
[164:07.78]So it's going to make the tunnel down to us.
[164:13.37]OK, so I'm going to die.
[164:14.49]I'm in a hole.
[164:18.53]Hey, Jeremy, you can drop that, you know.
[164:31.02]You can drop that and contribute.
[164:40.95]Oh, there's another keeper thingy here.
[164:53.20]They're good.
[164:59.81]They're good.
[165:09.73]So when should I smash my Razor Death at it with a hammer?
[165:14.25]Should I just put it in like a blender?
[165:16.91]Should I put this fucking thing in a blender?
[165:22.18]Yeah.
[165:25.54]Where's Ronnie?
[165:27.12]This is my life now!
[165:28.64]The wall keeps getting bigger.
[165:31.52]He's digging with a pickaxe and I'm like standing on top of him like shooting up.
[165:36.31]I made the tunnel there.
[165:38.43]We were already halfway in the ground.
[165:39.95]We don't know where the tunnel is.
[165:41.55]You could see it through the walls when it... when it... Fuck!
[165:44.41]Fuck!
[165:46.01]Fuck!
[165:46.51]Hey guys, what's up?
[165:47.25]Is that the wrong button?
[165:51.19]We should never have split up!
[165:52.85]We split up!
[165:54.16]We split up and that's what killed us!
[165:55.54]I bleached.
[165:55.76]I just bleached.
[165:57.66]Oh, now my computer's freaking out.
[165:58.88]I'm gonna die.
[166:04.74]I don't give you permission to clip that.
[166:11.42]When I screamed, I screamed, like, so hard, I farted.
[166:17.61]You better, uh, check.
[166:19.95]Wait, what?
[166:20.53]You better check for extra.
[166:24.29]Alright, go ahead and get me up.
[166:26.23]That's fine.
[166:26.73]Okay, yeah, no, no problem.
[166:27.69]I'll get you up.
[166:28.85]Yeah, I got this now.
[166:30.80]I found you.
[166:32.90]Alright, I think I'm gonna be bigger next time.
[166:40.33]Wait, you're going to be bigger.
[166:43.79]Bigger?
[166:44.81]Oh.
[166:48.01]But no, that probably requires coordination.
[166:53.17]So many.
[166:55.82]Not really.
[166:58.02]There are, though.
[167:04.72]No, no, no.
[167:29.10]I love being out of ammo.
[167:30.08]Alright, we're going back to back to back to back together.
[167:33.58]Next time.
[167:37.36]Uh, we're all gonna put on a shock collar, and if you go 20 feet away, you get shocked.
[168:06.14]Oh, I thought the star, I thought this was you, just like with your head poking out.
[168:21.17]I've got this.
[168:26.57]We should use cheat codes?
[168:28.83]I'm using, I'm trying to type them, but it's hard to run away from the bugs and type.
[168:31.75]Shut up!
[168:34.48]Can someone type black sheep block?
[168:36.90]Winer.
[168:59.12]I can hear you typing.
[169:05.81]Oh, shit!
[169:07.79]What?
[169:08.35]No, I didn't... I didn't know you were getting me.
[169:13.02]Fucking god damn it.
[169:18.38]No.
[169:18.56]I didn't think you... I didn't think you... I'm sitting here mashing on the keyboard.
[169:23.34]I thought we were done.
[169:24.84]I didn't move.
[169:29.28]Hey, you guys ran away from us.
[169:31.20]You went your own way, and you went your own tunnels, and we went a different direction.
[169:34.77]And that's what happened.
[169:37.05]Yeah, we did the hand-holding joke and everything.
[169:38.93]I thought there was treasure in this house.
[169:43.35]I have to revive Jerma.
[169:45.07]Can you imagine?
[169:46.01]I'm ready.
[169:46.65]I'm ready.
[169:48.07]I can't do it now.
[169:51.57]We're in a hole in the wall.
[169:52.75]You should be able to see us.
[169:54.71]Yeah, but I can't reach you unless I dig through the wall.
[169:59.02]Aww.
[169:59.68]Do we look at my keyboard when I type?
[170:01.10]Yeah, I didn't grow up with a computer in my lap.
[170:07.03]I had to learn.
[170:08.13]It's like learning a new language.
[170:11.01]What?
[170:11.91]Yeah.
[170:13.90]Sorry, ignore me.
[170:14.70]I ruined your joke.
[170:15.82]Sorry.
[170:16.40]You weren't born with a computer in your lap.
[170:18.60]Go ahead.
[170:19.24]Finish.
[170:22.37]Are you paying attention?
[170:26.83]Yes, I am.
[170:29.93]I was going to say you're older than I am, but I didn't even have a computer until I was like, yeah, 20.
[170:38.31]Yeah, they didn't give me one till I went to college, and it was one of those big ones that filled the whole room.
[170:44.49]I had to crank the generator for it.
[170:50.41]Well, one of us here is spoiled.
[170:54.40]Oh, that was perfect.
[171:05.44]I never had a cranking generator alright are we good no why is there another one of these they just keep coming out of nowhere
[171:26.02]You guys really were digging down like parallel to the hole that I made for you.
[171:30.46]We were already most of the way down when you made your hole and then I couldn't get to your hole.
[171:36.41]You could've and you don't.
[171:38.09]You just don't understand how this game is supposed to be played.
[171:40.67]I understand, I just don't believe you.
[171:42.91]You're a noob.
[171:45.26]Did you not resurrect other guy?
[171:46.78]Like you were the one in the hole.
[171:48.42]Other guy?
[171:51.66]You didn't get other guy?
[171:54.64]Oh, you didn't get other guy.
[171:56.22]You didn't get other guy.
[172:05.79]Okay, there's one resupply here, but it's like in the wall.
[172:13.59]Another swarm.
[172:14.35]So resupply and be ready.
[172:18.64]I'm good on supplies.
[172:19.82]Yeah, because you haven't played in an hour.
[172:22.40]Yeah, pretty much.
[172:25.18]Is that a record scratch?
[172:28.16]You're probably wondering how I got here.
[172:35.09]Why did this turn into like a fucking AM talk show?
[172:40.13]That's not a record scratch, that's my scream.
[172:44.02]It does sound like a record scratch.
[172:50.04]I'll do it quick.
[172:57.26]Oh, I think I just fucking destroyed Ronnie.
[173:00.46]I think it's a right of passage at this point.
[173:06.08]I did that earlier.
[173:15.78]Get off me!
[173:18.50]There's too many.
[173:19.10]There's too many.
[173:19.60]So the hitbox wasn't the problem?
[173:28.84]dude I don't know I guess not wow thank god alright we don't have any uh do we have enough for supplies no we don't no what the hell are we gonna do we have to keep going forward and get free supplies like let's start fighting forward down this hill
[174:03.00]There's one of these things.
[174:04.85]Where'd you guys go?
[174:07.73]Uh, down here.
[174:08.27]If you hold control, hold control, you can see where we are.
[174:10.99]Oh god, I found like a mother sack or something.
[174:13.39]Well, it's hard to hold control when I'm dead.
[174:15.44]Oh, are you dead?
[174:18.76]If you're dead, then why does it matter where we went?
[174:24.22]Are we killing the sack?
[174:31.93]Bad.
[174:32.25]Not good.
[174:33.19]There's a lot of ore over here.
[174:36.65]I don't know.
[174:45.22]Hey, Jerma.
[174:45.64]Do you have drill?
[174:47.08]I do have drill.
[174:48.86]I'm underneath you.
[174:50.44]Get up here.
[174:52.80]I'm making the call.
[174:54.12]You're making the call.
[174:54.96]Alright, what do you got?
[174:57.69]What do you need?
[174:58.57]Drill?
[174:58.81]Dig towards his dead body.
[175:01.23]Where I'm digging?
[175:01.83]Yeah, that way.
[175:07.51]Hold on.
[175:08.21]Out of juice.
[175:15.92]Like the last millisecond I realized what that was on the ground.
[175:19.06]I was like, oh, what is that?
[175:20.28]That was almost my clip.
[175:21.74]Almost.
[175:21.98]Almost your clip.
[175:33.00]There's a lot of this.
[175:33.70]So far we've gotten 20 more kites.
[175:36.62]Yeah, it's pretty bad, isn't it?
[175:40.22]I thought we were just here shooting bugs for fun, to be honest.
[175:43.12]There's also those, uh, those, those, those, those crystal, crystal, um, stalactites.
[175:48.50]Crystalite drinks?
[175:50.50]Crystalite is, is literal poison.
[175:52.30]Don't drink it.
[175:52.72]That's all Ashley.
[175:55.11]She doesn't drink it, she eats the dust.
[175:57.31]She doesn't mix it with water.
[175:58.45]She just eats the dust.
[176:00.33]Please be kidding.
[176:02.42]No!
[176:03.24]Ronnie, how many times have you heard me say Ashley eats dust?
[176:07.55]I just always assumed the dust came with liquid.
[176:10.67]Wait, hold on.
[176:11.57]She eats crystal light dust?
[176:14.07]Yeah.
[176:14.79]Are these like drug code words?
[176:20.73]Like, I heard of peanut butter dust, but I assumed she mixed it with... Yeah, she also eats the peanut butter to dust.
[176:25.85]That's like apocalypse.
[176:27.41]Okay, she does mix that.
[176:29.24]Alright.
[176:31.07]But that crystal light's not okay.
[176:33.41]Crystal light.
[176:35.03]Is that what they're calling it nowadays?
[176:36.46]Okay.
[176:38.38]Where are we going?
[176:40.92]I don't know.
[176:41.44]We have 65 out of 200.
[176:45.56]We need... Honestly, we need more nitro.
[176:48.37]Oh, I see.
[176:48.89]We're out of ammo again.
[176:54.18]basically what you're looking for at this point when you don't know where to go is one of those dirt walls would be the next area it's probably not a good idea I think I think I'm going backwards yeah we shouldn't go this way not this way I'm not talking to you I'm gonna stick some oh you're coming this way too yeah not this way I know everyone was following me and you're king
[177:23.08]I'm the king.
[177:24.84]Well, if she likes Crystal Light Dust, why doesn't she just get, like, a Pixie Stick?
[177:28.32]Isn't that the same thing?
[177:31.20]I think it's because Crystal Light has less sugar.
[177:33.59]Yeah, Crystal Light has zero calories.
[177:37.07]It would have to be.
[177:38.75]Oh, there's a thing in there.
[177:40.33]Oh, is this Nitro or... Oh, I found a bunch of Nitro.
[177:43.87]Pixie Sticks are for when you want to get serious, you know?
[177:46.81]Crystal Light is in the name.
[177:49.71]Crystal Light Dust is a...
[177:53.11]It's a gateway drug to pixie stone.
[177:56.09]Her parents are visiting this weekend and we went out to a river and we were swimming in the river.
[178:00.83]And she won't admit it was a river.
[178:05.95]And I'm worried about her.
[178:07.44]She keeps saying it was a lake.
[178:09.60]Was the water moving in one direction?
[178:11.86]Yeah.
[178:13.26]It's a river.
[178:14.20]Oh, it's here.
[178:15.30]I got the thing.
[178:16.16]I think she was calling it a lake because you can't see either end of the river because it was like a bend so it looked like a lake.
[178:23.33]But she won't admit that it was a river.
[178:25.29]But it's a 106 mile long river.
[178:30.09]What's it doing?
[178:31.69]Get over here.
[178:34.92]Well, rivers that are exactly... To be honest, that's just insulting to cartographers, okay?
[178:40.34]Well, see, little known fact.
[178:43.18]Rivers that are exactly 106 miles long are actually classified as lake.
[178:48.44]Really?
[178:49.30]Yeah.
[178:51.81]This is a very long lake.
[178:53.91]Yeah.
[178:58.15]That, and she's eating the dust.
[178:59.85]She's eating the lake dust now?
[179:02.23]She won't let me near her either.
[179:03.51]She's eating the lake dust.
[179:04.21]Anytime I try and talk to her, she's like, go away, I'm gassy.
[179:11.58]I deposited the Jade thing.
[179:17.65]uh okay I guess we're just going to talk about the game and I have like a real narrow problem malachite listen I opened up to you guys some people need to understand which is not an excuse for your mental health okay you handle that with a professional we've got bugs surrounded where's that dang mule
[179:43.41]I need it.
[179:43.77]I'm finding all the stuff you people need.
[179:50.96]Oh, God.
[179:51.30]I also found monsters.
[179:52.48]Monster!
[179:54.46]No, no, no.
[179:55.32]Don't fall down all the way.
[179:56.42]I'm good.
[179:57.86]No, no.
[180:00.68]Where are you going?
[180:01.94]I'm trying to not get killed.
[180:04.16]Where's this mule?
[180:05.02]I don't know.
[180:07.92]You called it.
[180:11.88]OK.
[180:11.98]We got to go up top here.
[180:15.39]Is there no more supply?
[180:17.63]We're close.
[180:18.59]We gotta keep pushing.
[180:24.19]That's not good.
[180:25.34]Where's that loot bunk?
[180:30.82]Is it loot bunk?
[180:36.00]Huh?
[180:36.86]What's so funny?
[180:37.54]What?
[180:39.78]Are you dead?
[180:41.46]Who's dead?
[180:44.18]Hey, that was definitely going on that stream.
[180:48.04]Only one of you can tap clip.
[180:49.67]Guys, I don't want to alarm you.
[180:52.55]But... That bugs everyone.
[180:57.75]Literally everyone.
[180:59.53]We need to go to the top.
[181:02.65]I'm trying to... People are dying.
[181:03.92]I'm trying to help.
[181:04.72]I'm trying to wrangle children.
[181:07.82]People are dying down here.
[181:08.98]We're dying down here.
[181:10.86]You sit up up in your tower and fucking look down.
[181:15.93]We're trying to make things happen down here, trying to survive.
[181:28.22]Are you posting the picture of me hugging the waterfall?
[181:33.51]Dead.
[181:37.95]Alright, we've broken through.
[181:41.37]But I think that we ended up...

[182:17.73]I don't know.
[182:19.77]Look at the map.
[182:20.37]The map we... We could go down.
[182:26.49]Down to the left.
[182:27.66]Lower left.
[182:28.24]We kind of have to like go all the way down left.
[182:30.66]If you open up the map.
[182:31.54]We gotta go this way then.
[182:35.54]Follow me.
[182:36.90]We're going down here.
[182:37.64]We could go like this way.
[182:49.81]I'm losing it.

[185:19.62]Do not touch the red button on the back of the mule.
[185:25.62]I'm Jerma.
[185:27.64]What do you not want me to do?
[185:30.38]Supply plot requisitioned.
[185:31.83]Launching now.
[185:34.60]Here's the question.
[185:35.98]If they can just drop resupply pods from wherever they want, why don't they just arm us with the drill that the resupply pod uses?
[185:45.53]Shut up.
[185:48.71]Because... Never mind, I was going to say like a TV show thing.
[185:54.46]I mean, this is pretty much like the faster than light Star Wars issue all over again.
[185:59.26]Okay, so we need a second to plan.
[186:00.64]Will you look at the map?
[186:02.28]and try and figure out where we came back from.
[186:05.06]You press the button, the thing walks back.
[186:06.56]You can either follow the mule, or we can just start drilling.
[186:09.46]Well, if you want, we can start drilling up if you want.
[186:13.59]We gotta be ready for that, though.
[186:14.91]Where do you want to go?
[186:17.43]It looks like... Okay, come on.
[186:19.25]We can just start walking this way and then call a mule to us.
[186:21.95]Okay, hold on.
[186:22.77]Come over here.
[186:25.11]If we go over here... If we go through this tunnel and then up...
[186:33.55]Yeah, like this way.
[186:35.97]Climb back up this.
[186:36.91]Climb back up that.
[186:41.17]Because we have to get back up to the top, right?
[186:43.77]Yeah.
[186:47.45]I'm lagged.
[186:47.99]Watch out, it's Bug City.
[186:49.57]Oh, fuck, it is Bug City.
[186:53.31]Come on, help me!
[187:05.00]okay so then from here we should be able to go up this way just like straight up this way over here right because then that'll take us like uh alright let's go alright let's
[187:29.01]Let's clear this and then we'll go clear.
[187:31.77]Don't go yet.
[187:33.31]Yeah, just set up defense here.
[187:38.32]Because otherwise we're going to get swarmed while we're trying to figure out.
[187:42.94]Combat positions, the swarm is here.
[187:58.69]Watch the behind.
[187:59.27]Watch the behind.
[188:01.27]Damn, this is getting annoying.
[188:11.58]Oh my god, come on.
[188:19.52]What the hell?
[188:20.22]Alright, we ready to move?
[188:26.75]There's a big dude over here.
[188:51.63]What the hell?
[188:52.69]Alright.
[188:53.21]We're alright.
[188:55.99]We're OK.
[188:56.64]Oh, it hurts.
[189:16.06]Alright, we ready?
[189:17.32]Yeah.
[189:17.72]So now we got to go.
[189:20.30]We got to go like up this way then.
[189:23.60]Also, the mule walks back to it so we can just follow the mule.
[189:26.50]Just follow the mule?
[189:27.50]Yeah.
[189:30.42]Okay.
[189:33.13]I'm just going to stand on top of it.
[189:35.73]Easy.
[189:36.25]And now, yeah, now it shows you where the drop pod is coming to.
[189:44.55]Drop on the right.
[189:46.76]Yeah, we can just, we can dig through.
[189:48.46]I'm bad on ammo.
[189:51.30]Oh wow, it really is Meezy Mode.
[189:55.36]Yeah, you really do get to ride it.
[189:56.42]Oh, I don't think you used to be able to do that.
[190:01.54]No, he got away from me!
[190:02.27]It's just going through this.
[190:03.25]Oh yeah, we had you guys dug this tunnel.
[190:06.91]You're welcome.
[190:09.57]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[190:11.13]Oh god, what?
[190:17.05]Hold on, is it... Oh, fuck!
[190:21.89]Uh-oh.
[190:23.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[190:27.09]Oh, God, there's big bugs behind us.
[190:31.14]Oh, God, I'm not gonna make it.
[190:32.18]Overheating, overheating.
[190:33.72]Where are we?
[190:34.98]Almost there, almost there, almost there.
[190:37.18]We're out, we're out, we're out.
[190:39.00]I have no guns.
[190:41.78]Where the hell did it go?
[190:42.56]Over there.
[190:44.00]Oh, shit!
[190:48.74]I'm never going to dig 85 meters in four minutes.
[190:52.16]Hi.
[190:52.30]Hey.
[190:52.46]Oh, me and the Talics are up here.
[190:57.78]You guys good?
[190:59.60]Oh, different hole.
[191:01.40]Talics, what do we do?
[191:03.30]Just let the bugs go eat them and we'll escape.
[191:05.94]You got to run.
[191:08.31]I'll get up there eventually.
[191:09.97]Just look towards the drop pod and dig.
[191:12.15]Yes, I'm doing.
[191:12.83]Drop pod will leave with or without you.
[191:18.75]Why did you say you were there?
[191:19.77]Are we alright?
[191:21.93]Are we okay?
[191:23.47]Are we alright?
[191:25.49]I have no fuel!
[191:28.68]We're almost there!
[191:47.24]Where the fuck are we?
[191:52.36]You said you were there!
[191:56.43]One for you and one for me.
[191:57.69]I actually ran the whole path.
[192:03.31]Oh no, don't die.
[192:04.27]Alright, here we go.
[192:08.13]No, which way is the right way?
[192:09.33]Which way is the correct way?
[192:11.11]I'm down.
[192:13.73]Where am I going?
[192:18.05]See you at home We alright to be fair we did you get did you make it?
[192:30.40]Yeah, yes We've pulled everybody into that tunnel
[192:43.82]Nice job, everyone.
[192:45.10]I hope Jerma stretched his shoulder before he threw that hard.
[192:47.72]I don't have any... Nobody had any ammo.
[192:49.22]We didn't know... I'm trying to, like, just dig.
[192:51.14]We're fine.
[192:52.10]The mission's... We won.
[192:55.18]Yeah, we won as a team.
[192:55.92]I'm still alive!
[193:01.44]When you don't stick to the plan, this is what happens.
[193:04.22]Let's get back to work.
[193:08.19]You're still alive.
[193:08.89]Why are we resurrecting in the medbay?
[193:11.59]Well, because we were checking on you guys.
[193:17.46]That was so fucking bad, though.
[193:20.06]I had the depth wrong, and I turned the camera, and we were just tunneling like a tube sock on the left side of the map.
[193:26.87]But we did pull everybody away from Star, and then we may not have made it out alive without that.
[193:34.99]Yeah, I just bailed.
[193:35.69]How do I get a second freaking turret?
[193:43.06]I don't see the upgrade for it.
[193:46.18]You should just always have two turrets.
[193:48.18]I had it at level one.
[193:50.42]I did back in the beta and I cannot figure out how to get my second.
[193:53.30]It's the same button.
[193:54.82]So like you press four to place a turret, then you press four to place the next one.
[193:58.72]And when I do that, it just recalls the previous one.
[194:03.42]I don't think it should.
[194:11.96]what do you think faster shield regen rate or regen starts sooner for shield I don't know check out youtube videos who they say you're the one you're making it you're making that video now so yeah he's trying to get some insider tips everyone's saying sooner I would get better guns before you can get
[194:37.68]I mean, I have one upgrade already into my... I need... I need this, like, silver ore.
[194:44.34]It's like a silver circle.
[194:48.14]I don't have any of it.
[194:51.44]I don't know what it is.
[194:53.40]There's an upgrade that makes you have one better turret instead of two weak gems.
[194:57.90]No, I've even... Oh, I can switch which modifications I'm using.
[195:02.36]Aha!
[195:03.00]Yeah.
[195:03.24]Well, that's a game changer.
[195:05.44]Aha!
[195:09.69]Give me that better drill.
[195:10.53]Alright, let me put some perks in.
[195:18.12]Accessories.
[195:19.10]Oh, shit.
[195:19.64]What is this stuff?
[195:20.76]A clean shave?
[195:21.70]Oh, what was that company?
[195:24.10]Dollar Shave Club?
[195:25.38]Wow, did a terrible job advertising.
[195:27.58]Doesn't even remember the name of it from the same stream.
[195:29.86]We're gonna need another plug.
[195:33.26]By the way, this is for comedy purposes only.
[195:36.16]This is with no affiliation at all.
[195:37.40]We have to say that otherwise you could get in trouble for what you just did.
[195:41.84]Fuck that one shave club.
[195:45.36]This is an opinion of somebody here.
[195:47.50]I don't even know who this is.
[195:51.40]I've never met them before in my life.
[195:52.46]I don't know who they are.
[195:53.82]Gillette is the best a man can get.
[195:59.66]I cannot confirm or deny any of the statements.
[196:02.60]What if I'm not a man?
[196:04.38]Oh, these are just hats.
[196:12.21]Yeah.
[196:12.39]Well, that's cool.
[196:21.35]This upgrade screen is not rad and sexy as fuck, making my tummy twerk.
[196:26.03]What the fuck are you talking about?
[196:29.91]Are we ready?
[196:33.37]I am now ready.
[196:34.23]Wait, wait, wait.
[196:34.77]Where's the perk screen?
[196:38.25]Inside your room.
[196:41.30]I think there's something wrong with my gun.
[196:43.76]What's wrong?
[196:49.62]It's just not used to being handled by such a handsome man.
[196:58.25]I don't have any available perks?
[197:00.31]Yeah, I do.
[197:00.91]Yes!
[197:04.07]Hot potato!
[197:06.77]Alright, what are these?
[197:07.61]Which one of these do I want?
[197:09.30]Hey, hey, hey.
[197:10.20]I'm on Ster's floor.
[197:17.20]Look, chat.
[197:17.80]I don't know what you're thinking right now, but this is all real.
[197:20.68]It's happening.
[197:21.78]It's live.
[197:25.61]Pure perk mania.
[197:31.95]Whoa, what's going on?
[197:32.91]We're about to leave, okay.
[197:37.43]Oh, I need the ore that's here.
[197:40.61]How did me walking inside add seconds?
[197:45.70]What time is it right now?
[197:47.60]Can I BRB real quick?
[197:49.04]Oh my god.
[197:51.10]Hey guys, what's up?
[197:54.64]Hey.
[197:55.16]Hey guys, what's up?
[197:56.36]Hey, what's up?
[197:58.34]Hey guys, what's up?
[198:00.53]Hi.
[198:01.01]I'm unplugging the router.
[198:03.97]I'm just gonna unplug the router.
[198:05.95]Must be my internet taking so long to load.
[198:07.71]I can't imagine my computer slowing us down.
[198:10.19]Unless you all just have way better computers.
[198:12.19]No.
[198:12.29]My computer's not slow.
[198:12.97]It can do 144 and Overwatch just fine.
[198:14.97]By the way, I think I just heard a door close behind me.
[198:29.10]I'm fairly certain he, like, actually went to the bathroom and, like, put, like, a clip on.
[198:32.64]That's funny.
[198:36.01]A clip on?
[198:36.71]Like a tie?
[198:38.67]He's got an interview later.
[198:47.69]It, like, started us right next to this objective.
[198:49.85]I mean, that's pretty great.
[198:50.57]Ooh, we need the shrooms.
[198:59.50]Um, we've got... How long does it take for that to explode?
[199:06.03]Pretty long, actually.
[199:06.75]Salvage.
[199:08.71]These things are annoying, huh?
[199:10.89]You are boomed!
[199:26.13]Don't ever boom.
[199:26.67]Boom.
[199:26.81]Alright, repaired.
[199:27.45]One mule has been repaired.
[199:29.19]I still have one of these things.
[199:31.67]Is there another one around here?
[199:32.79]It's right here?
[199:33.47]Doesn't look like it.
[199:57.44]I think that's the bonus leg.
[200:00.04]You know how cars have like a extra tire on the back?
[200:05.24]Dirt.
[200:06.74]Like a kickstand.
[200:08.60]Oh, hey, welcome back, Etalyx.
[200:10.34]Hey.
[200:11.82]Thanks for helping us.
[200:14.56]I am helping.
[200:15.68]You're all fine.
[200:19.12]Drilling.
[200:22.78]Who am I getting?
[200:25.56]You needed me.
[200:27.16]Is there... No, I got it.
[200:34.58]Alright, more.
[200:36.00]What do we need?
[200:36.51]We need 20 of those mushroom caps.
[200:39.33]They're the weird, like... You gotta find the Jerma985 mushrooms.
[200:45.27]No.
[200:45.55]Yes, harvest my mushroom.
[200:53.04]Never felt better.
[200:57.59]This is weird.
[200:59.60]Hey guys, this is the mushroom.
[201:01.28]Yes, that is... Harvest it.
[201:02.64]Come on.
[201:03.26]Harvest it.
[201:04.02]Do it.
[201:05.06]Pull it up.
[201:06.14]Yes.
[201:11.23]Oh, we need that shit, don't we?
[201:14.09]Mm-hmm.
[201:14.43]You want ammo?
[201:15.15]Yeah.
[201:15.35]Okay.
[201:15.59]Need more?
[201:28.86]Somebody everybody has their own gamer noises.
[201:38.81]I had a face hugger on me.
[201:45.00]First time being hugged.
[201:49.60]Wow.
[201:52.24]Oh, we all get hugged all the time.
[201:55.97]My God.
[201:59.79]Alright, we good.
[202:01.75]No, this thing.
[202:02.37]Hey, I told you!
[202:03.85]What the hell?
[202:05.25]Hey, hit it in the weak point!
[202:14.28]There's a facehugger on me.
[202:20.91]He is just tearing me apart right now.
[202:24.89]It sounds like a you problem.
[202:26.39]It is a me problem.
[202:27.39]Yeah, it is.
[202:28.05]He just gently put me down.
[202:31.45]I'm sorry.
[202:32.67]Beauty and the Beast right there.
[202:33.63]You know, they look scary, but really, they care.
[202:45.56]That's a lot of ammo you're using on like an NPC.
[202:50.78]Kind of just sits there and does nothing.
[202:54.32]Not bothering anybody.
[202:57.94]Gold.
[202:58.72]Gold.
[202:59.38]Gold.
[202:59.94]More gold.
[203:01.12]Alright.
[203:02.26]Whoa.
[203:04.16]Okay, how we doing?
[203:12.90]Bad.
[203:14.08]Check.
[203:14.68]Bad time.
[203:15.58]I'm kind of down in the pit dying.
[203:19.40]Thanks for the gold.
[203:20.28]Hi, sir.
[203:21.07]Loot bug.
[203:28.15]Why are there so many of these little flyboys?
[203:35.52]I'm afraid to do that.
[203:36.38]I'm not doing that.
[203:36.96]Somebody else can get this.
[203:37.74]Whoa!
[203:45.34]There you go.
[203:48.85]Can somebody get up there?
[203:49.75]Yeah, there we go.
[203:53.65]We need somebody to get those jewels over there.
[203:56.57]Oh, we have a grapple guy?
[204:00.34]I've got a grapple down.
[204:02.98]Cool.
[204:03.48]Where are the jewels though?
[204:15.39]Nitro.
[204:17.33]Ooh, a grapple.
[204:18.03]Cool.
[204:18.55]What the hell is that?
[204:19.73]Oh, that's the thing that must be summoning all this nonsense.
[204:22.17]Can you reach that?
[204:24.81]Kill it!
[204:26.58]I'm going to get this stuff.
[204:28.68]Kill it!
[204:42.36]Is he dead?
[204:42.90]Kill it!
[204:47.40]Coming!
[204:49.18]You see this grapple over here?
[204:50.73]Can you reach it?
[204:58.69]Where's the deposit?
[205:00.21]Was that the safety deposit box thing?
[205:03.95]You can hit D and it'll come to you.
[205:07.64]What is that thing in the middle?
[205:16.87]I owe you one brother.
[205:30.12]No, I'm dead.
[205:31.70]I owe you one.
[205:39.97]I should watch Star Wars on stream.
[205:44.31]Yeah, definitely.
[205:45.87]That sounds like a good idea.
[205:47.87]I wonder if I'll be permanently removed from this platform.
[205:52.53]The new one?
[205:53.37]Is there a new one?
[205:53.95]Yeah, just go to the theater.
[205:58.24]Go to the theater and just while you're watching the new Star Wars, just stream the screen.
[206:02.96]That's fine.
[206:03.68]No, you can do that.
[206:04.32]You can totally get away with it.
[206:05.14]You just do it right.
[206:06.80]Like, make sure you switch your game category to Artifact and you can get away with it.
[206:15.78]Imagine you sitting there just, like, cheering, like, yeah!
[206:20.58]I don't- you'd probably make it to the opening credits.
[206:22.86]This is awesome!
[206:27.52]You can probably do it longer than that.
[206:30.63]Not if your title was the new Star Wars movie in theaters.
[206:35.03]Reaction.
[206:38.31]Alright, so are we going down?
[206:42.30]I'm not sure where we're going.
[206:44.08]I hear this, like, beep.
[206:45.62]I think we have to go down here.
[206:47.38]Come to us.
[206:49.37]Come to me and Etalyx.
[206:50.93]Because I think there's one of those beep bops over here.
[206:55.61]Let's do this safe, Etalyx.
[206:56.91]Is there a resupply down there?
[206:58.75]I think there's... Yeah.
[207:01.27]One more use on it?
[207:03.98]Alright, I didn't go... What?
[207:06.54]I just, like, tactically suicided.
[207:09.34]I thought we were going slow.
[207:15.87]Pay attention to us.
[207:16.73]I am.
[207:17.05]What are you talking about?
[207:20.57]Pay attention to me.
[207:23.09]Notice me.

[210:23.34]What are you guys doing, though?
[210:24.96]I am curious.
[210:27.49]We might have, we might have enough to defeat it.
[210:31.09]What's the big green glowy one?
[210:32.31]Is that different somehow?
[210:34.37]Uh, I don't, whoa.
[210:35.31]It's poison, okay.

[210:41.44]Um, five.
[210:43.60]So that's nine.

[210:47.18]Mission's over.
[210:48.80]We have enough.
[210:52.00]Yeah, let's go get to that dog.
[210:55.94]Polly, over here!
[210:57.93]Oh, you guys are right here.
[210:59.93]We made it.
[211:07.82]So nice of you to join us.
[211:08.78]Covering fire.
[211:19.59]I'm so confused.
[211:22.15]Mission's over.
[211:22.71]We beat it.
[211:24.59]We didn't do anything.
[211:25.77]You just deposit the mushrooms and it's over.
[211:30.90]We have enough mushrooms.
[211:31.56]We need one more and that's it.
[211:41.41]I was told we were done.
[211:44.05]We are, we just need to put in your mushroom caps.
[211:51.26]I was told it was over.
[211:52.36]Who hasn't deposited their mushroom caps?
[211:54.74]I got mine in.
[211:55.69]I got mine in.
[212:00.42]I already pushed the button.
[212:03.22]I didn't even have one.
[212:05.47]Bugs.
[212:06.05]I know where I can go get one.
[212:08.45]Don't worry.
[212:11.69]I'm just on point tonight.
[212:15.45]You're banging on all cylinders, man.
[212:19.23]You had it the whole time.
[212:21.45]No, I went and grabbed one.
[212:23.91]He had it the whole time.
[212:25.17]I did not.
[212:25.63]I got a whole stream over here, though.
[212:27.27]I'll tell you.
[212:36.81]Die like your mother did.
[212:42.12]So we need to uplink.
[212:42.96]Are we ready to do this?
[212:44.72]You guys ready?
[212:45.20]Yeah, I hate when people say that to me.
[212:47.48]Are you guys good?
[212:49.80]Press the button?
[212:50.76]Here we go.
[212:56.60]This is where we gotta uplink and we gotta defend.
[212:58.28]Maybe this is a therapy stream.
[212:59.76]Is this like a parent issue stream?
[213:00.94]Jeremiah, I love your streams.
[213:02.98]You always make me twerk.
[213:04.38]Please click this for a free iPod.
[213:06.02]Why are there virus bots in this chat right now?
[213:24.81]That is a virus bot.
[213:26.35]You clicked a link and your account got taken over by the bot.
[213:29.91]Did it say you make me twerk?
[213:32.17]Yes.
[213:34.87]Yeah, go run Malwarebytes, or whoever's account that is.
[213:38.32]I think you might need it.
[213:40.52]Everyone's helping me with this?
[213:41.66]That's cool.
[213:43.40]I'm doing a really good job.
[213:46.50]Uplink ready.
[213:47.50]Triangulation initiated.
[213:49.66]We defend.
[213:50.16]Triangulation zone, or we'll lose the connection.
[213:52.78]We only got one shot at this.
[213:57.95]We've only got one shot at this.
[213:59.29]If you fail, retry from the hub.
[214:04.49]Just do it again.
[214:13.42]Alright, let me get like a big... No.

[214:49.40]Just help down there if anybody really needs it.
[214:51.34]Get in that tunnel across from us.
[214:53.16]There's a secret thingy in there for a drill guy.
[214:55.24]Is there?
[214:57.34]What?
[214:57.54]Can you, like, point to it?
[214:59.94]Do you see that?
[215:01.41]I see it.
[215:01.79]I'll get it.
[215:02.29]I'll get it.
[215:02.65]I'll get it.
[215:03.69]I'll get it.
[215:12.49]Whoa!
[215:14.93]Ooh, which game had, like, an aura thing you had to defend first?
[215:19.39]This or Risk of Rain?
[215:23.09]Uh, all games are the same game, so it doesn't matter.
[215:27.91]Alright, how do I... I gotta get up from here.
[215:30.07]I think it was Pong?
[215:36.91]Uh, do we have any drop ammo?
[215:40.44]Get away from me!
[215:42.08]There should be one down there.
[215:43.72]They're all swarming me in here.
[215:44.74]I'm just trying to get the thing.
[215:47.38]I got you.
[215:48.48]Yeah, help me.
[215:49.48]Protect me while I search.
[215:50.99]Please get back into the triangulation zone.
[215:52.99]The risk of people losing your signal.
[215:57.59]Got it.
[215:59.49]Protect me.
[216:00.55]Can we all please get back into the triangulation zone?
[216:02.79]Protect me, protect me, protect me.
[216:03.77]Yeah, that's actually, we have to stay inside that.
[216:05.69]Is the two people not in the triangulation zone?
[216:08.21]I'm getting dragged.
[216:09.09]I got sucked out.
[216:11.35]The gold bar.
[216:13.65]Where's the gold bar?
[216:16.71]Important, where's the gold bar?
[216:18.65]I dropped the gold bar.
[216:21.37]Where's the gold bar?
[216:22.31]It fell because I got grabbed.
[216:23.85]Are we going to lose this, guys?
[216:26.28]Yeah.
[216:38.12]I got the gold thing.
[216:39.28]I was directed by our director here, Star, to go get gold thing.
[216:44.16]What is this?
[216:44.60]Too far?
[216:44.88]I got it.
[216:45.12]It didn't take me very long.
[216:46.34]Let me be fair to myself here.
[216:47.66]I was on top of that real quick.
[217:08.57]I got a whole stream over here that'll back me up.
[217:10.61]Stay inside the triangulation zone.
[217:13.05]Get back in there.
[217:14.33]Oh God, I'm dead.
[217:18.20]You're jeopardizing the mission.
[217:19.90]Get back to the triangulation zone.
[217:21.44]I can't believe we just lost.
[217:24.88]Metallics needed his handheld.
[217:31.19]I need a soft and supple touch.
[217:35.33]I need someone to call daddy.
[217:43.90]Hi.
[217:45.16]Jesus.
[218:00.06]When you don't stick to the plan, this is what happens, you blaggards.
[218:04.62]That ended as well as could be expected.
[218:07.96]Good one.
[218:19.33]this is me I'm throwing a tantrum right now hmm do you think guys think the one turret well okay they got stats never mind I can figure it out
[218:37.18]I'm just resigned to the fact that I'll never be able to upgrade anything.
[218:41.42]Can we beat that one level that one time?
[218:42.76]Alright.
[218:43.86]How about we drop the difficulty by one?
[218:46.18]Is it really that embarrassing to play on, like, not the hard one?
[218:50.16]That wasn't even the hard one.
[218:52.34]Mission selected.
[218:53.40]Powering up the drop bot.
[218:54.78]But sure, yeah, we can do baby mode.
[218:59.76]What is... Okay, is baby mode regular mode?
[219:03.52]No.
[219:04.30]It's not.
[219:05.42]Baby mode is...
[219:07.95]Dude, I don't know.
[219:09.65]Dude, I... Stop!
[219:13.99]Stop yelling!
[219:15.85]I'm very calm and I'm very collected.
[219:17.49]I'm just asking a few questions about this video game.
[219:19.55]Stop!
[219:20.55]Good times.
[219:22.86]Oh, you guys are leaving.
[219:25.58]I was still... What does drill mean?
[219:30.10]We all meditate for a second.
[219:31.42]Hey, clip this.
[219:32.46]My name's Joe.
[219:33.20]I want to play on the hard one.
[219:34.38]Baby mode's not fun.
[219:44.11]My stomach can't take it!
[219:45.63]Okay, now that we're all calm... This is gonna be a walk in the park!
[219:52.01]How about we get the f*** out of Minerals?
[219:55.21]My name is John!
[219:55.93]I-I-I don't like playing on hard mode!
[219:57.57]I like playing on easy mode!
[219:58.81]What's in hard mode?
[220:00.42]I mean, the other way around.
[220:01.78]Reverse it.
[220:04.14]Reverse what?
[220:04.58]This is your salvage mission.
[220:06.74]This is you.
[220:07.40]This is your fate!
[220:13.66]I can't wait to come to one of your streams and just wait till you do that, and then I'm gonna... Yes, it will.
[220:19.68]Yes, it will.
[220:20.36]It's gonna happen every five minutes.
[220:22.46]See, Ronnie's laughing.
[220:23.20]Ronnie does.
[220:23.90]No, I'm saying what will never happen is you coming to one of my streams.
[220:26.76]When was the last time you were at my stream?
[220:30.97]Oh, by... Hold on a minute.
[220:33.75]It's funny that you say that.
[220:35.15]Who is still subscribed to the other person?
[220:41.82]Can I ask you that, just right off the bat here?
[220:44.89]Which one of us is currently, like, has a three and a half year sub to the other person?
[220:48.43]Is it you?
[220:48.99]I don't, I forget sometimes.
[220:51.07]Who is it?
[220:52.67]I'm pretty sure I'm subbed to you.
[220:53.99]Are you subbed to me right now?
[220:56.85]Let's find out.
[220:57.54]Yeah.
[220:57.92]Talk in the chat.
[221:00.84]Hold on, I gotta open up a stream.
[221:02.16]Yeah, he's gonna sub, like, right now.
[221:11.75]Don't gift Ster us up, please don't.
[221:16.42]Why did you just give, why did you just, why did you just give $30?
[221:31.88]What are you doing?
[221:38.25]What?
[221:38.81]He just donated 30 fucking dollars to the stream.
[221:46.38]Is that you making up the time that you were not subscribed?
[221:49.94]Yeah.
[221:51.22]Hey, thanks.
[221:53.54]Thanks for the 30 bucks.
[221:59.93]What the fuck?
[222:01.33]Wow, that was the first time you've ever thanked anyone.
[222:03.75]You've been gifted a sub.
[222:07.11]Honestly, I told you I was subbed.
[222:08.99]Anonymous has gifted his sub tier 1 to Ster.
[222:13.34]I told you.
[222:13.96]Can we leave like the tutorial zone here?
[222:19.76]I'm looking for Bolo, Bolo Cholos or whatever.
[222:23.30]He's been gifted like five times.
[222:28.18]Wait, they can do that now?
[222:29.16]Is that possible?
[222:30.04]Hold on.
[222:31.37]You've been gifted a sub more than once?
[222:37.07]After this stream, he'll never have to manually subscribe to you again.
[222:40.38]No.
[222:50.14]That's so funny.
[222:51.96]Hey, let me take care of this.
[222:54.02]Hey, non-subs out.
[222:58.29]This is leading to nowhere, kind of.
[222:59.59]It's up here where I am.
[223:03.03]This is really weird.
[223:06.70]That is really weird.
[223:10.00]Nonsub.
[223:16.32]Subs.
[223:16.66]Lumber food.
[223:18.18]See, for context, guys, you actually can't play with Jerma unless you're subscribed to him.
[223:21.72]That's why I still have my subs.
[223:23.68]Subs.
[223:24.44]Found it.
[223:40.69]Alright, why did that just happen to us?
[223:45.37]Did you just do that?
[223:46.05]There was like a gas.
[223:46.97]The gas knocked us off the ledge.
[224:05.47]Oh, ow.
[224:06.75]Mmm, yum.
[224:08.67]Actually, never mind.

[224:16.17]That's what it tastes like.
[224:17.71]The firewall?
[224:18.63]The fireball candy.
[224:20.15]So, cinnamon.
[224:20.83]Forehead?
[224:21.39]Yeah, cinnamon.

[226:32.12]You know what's sad?
[226:33.30]Your son's been really good today at this game.
[226:37.46]But we've had some problems that I'd like to address after the stream is over.
[226:42.70]Some issues?
[226:45.00]I don't think you're aware of this.
[226:46.04]We don't think that he's playing well with others.
[226:48.46]And...
[226:52.18]We want to do something about it on a more permanent basis, so you're gonna find another school.
[227:00.96]We gotta go get that supply thing down.
[227:02.32]There's a mule down there, and we need to... it's beeping.
[227:04.94]I was gonna say, you're not aware of this, but, um, my mom likes Jerm more than me.
[227:13.50]That's... actually true.
[227:19.66]It's not true!
[227:20.32]That's not true.
[227:21.44]It is.
[227:24.40]No, it's not true.
[227:27.08]I asked her what her favorite video of mine was, and she named one of your videos.
[227:35.77]Were you at least in the video?
[227:38.15]I think so.
[227:42.07]Was I at least in the video?
[227:45.07]I think you said Ratburger.
[227:48.37]I mean, but that is, like, I mean, that's a classic.

[228:08.44]Oh, God.
[228:10.60]Oh, here's the thing.
[228:12.92]Yeah, that's what I'm doing down here.
[228:14.20]This is so awkward.
[228:21.12]Is there a way to find the broken... I'm currently near one right now.
[228:26.07]Mules?
[228:26.97]Like, is it on the map?
[228:28.07]It just beeps.
[228:31.15]It's like... Yeah, it's on the map.
[228:34.55]You see where I am over here?
[228:38.09]It's in this little cave, but all the parts are above it, above this cave.
[228:45.05]I'm going to need some... I'm probably going to alert a horde when I do this.
[228:53.62]I'm grappled to the air.
[228:55.50]Good.
[228:57.50]Okay.
[229:00.60]And, uh, fellas, this is probably gonna have to be my last game because I have to take Otto to the vet.
[229:10.81]Oh, likely story.
[229:12.37]Like, my mom shows up and suddenly you have to, like, leave.
[229:15.74]Oh, and, like, oh, she's leaving at the same time, too?
[229:18.84]Oh, nothing's going on here.
[229:21.06]What the fuck are you saying right now?
[229:23.62]Oh my god.
[229:31.08]I just, I just, I've never heard of this dog, what, his name, Otto, before now.
[229:36.56]That's all I'm saying.
[229:37.79]Yeah.
[229:38.67]Just, that sounds like a story.
[229:41.05]Oh god, I'm gonna die.
[229:41.93]Just, obviously.
[229:45.95]Now we got one mule.
[229:59.50]Grenades out.
[230:02.10]Grenades out.
[230:03.56]Need ammo.
[230:04.22]Just say everything you're doing.
[230:06.28]Torching.
[230:07.39]Running.
[230:08.45]Bleeding out.
[230:09.49]Stunning.
[230:12.17]This is the worst.
[230:14.87]What's the worst?
[230:17.69]Robot over here is in the worst spot.
[230:19.41]It's so annoying to do this alone and no one's helping me.
[230:21.81]There's like a grapple guy that could be helping them.
[230:23.94]I'm all alone.
[230:25.40]And my mom's in the chat like, yeah, my favorite stream of yours is when Jerma played Stardew Valley.
[230:30.27]Well, you definitely would be more the clips if you were, like, over here.
[230:35.67]Then she might see you more when she watches his video.
[230:40.19]It's a stream I did, like, fucking four years ago.
[230:43.93]What?
[230:45.11]But it is.
[230:45.55]But you're not in that.
[230:46.73]But you're not in that.
[230:47.37]Is that... Wait.
[230:47.73]Hold on.
[231:02.64]words just like flipped out of my mouth it was like I had nothing to say about it that's why that's the point she's a real fan alright we got that done yeah she came here to visit was like hey check out my glue man shirt it's a pretty nice shirt it's below us yeah I found I found something
[231:28.96]By the way, those are still available.
[231:31.20]Look at me.
[231:31.64]They are here.
[231:33.46]Just hit.
[231:34.68]What?
[231:36.14]That's it.
[231:38.54]Okay.
[231:38.76]Look, she's already bought one.
[231:40.57]Okay, you don't need to advertise it again.
[231:42.17]Please stop.
[231:43.77]Look, it's closer to it now.
[231:45.49]We're going to climb up.
[231:46.21]No, it's not.
[231:47.15]You fucking tool.
[231:49.85]Oh, look.
[231:50.73]It's in there.
[231:51.25]Relax.
[231:51.87]Down and go.
[231:58.98]I've been trying to bring them in there for like, it feels like an hour.
[232:03.03]It has been an hour, I think.
[232:08.19]At least.
[232:08.51]Oh, but it's closer now.
[232:13.17]Hey, you guys are all doing great.
[232:15.13]We just had to draw this particular round out long enough until Jerma has to go.
[232:23.60]So we're like doing exactly right.
[232:25.64]We're doing it.
[232:26.08]Yeah, we're doing it right.
[232:26.92]Alright, give me a chance to redeem myself.
[232:29.62]Okay, here it is.
[232:30.42]You guys are... What are you guys even up to over here?
[232:38.77]I feel like me and Etalyx are missing out on what's happening.
[232:42.11]Well, I'm going to be honest.
[232:43.37]I've been following you guys around for about two and a half, three hours.
[232:45.63]I still have no idea.
[232:46.57]I've just been pretending the entire time.
[232:47.85]Tell me when it's going to land.
[232:48.49]Tell me when it's going to land.
[232:49.17]When is it going to land?
[232:50.11]Ugh.
[232:53.58]Oh, I made it.
[232:54.06]Alright, where is it?
[232:57.98]It's down here somewhere.
[233:10.54]alright I'm throwing this at Ster no what are you doing I don't hear the beats I don't know where it is you won't tell me well I've marked it like six times you mark it how do you do that it's up like seven cliffs from here I'll get it oh there's this room we only need one more room and this is it right here
[233:42.88]Can I have be on the zip line and bring you to actually can.
[233:46.42]That's really awesome.
[233:52.68]Alright.
[233:53.38]Marked on the map running.
[233:59.16]No, no.
[233:59.54]Look, it's in that little cave.
[234:03.50]Why is it all the way up there when I throw it to the bottom?
[234:06.03]I don't know, dude.
[234:07.63]Where did you go?
[234:08.29]Oh, it's there.
[234:11.03]I don't know.
[234:11.98]Why would I throw it down there if it was all the way up here to explain that?
[234:16.98]I don't know.
[234:18.70]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[234:20.80]I just now realized I have a shield mine.
[234:22.78]Oh, this is pretty cool.
[234:25.66]I do hear the beep now.
[234:29.14]I hear it.
[234:32.00]Big brained baby?
[234:35.76]Who?
[234:40.50]An eternity later.
[234:45.62]Alright, I got one cap.
[234:46.42]Let's see if we can do this.
[234:48.92]This time, let's focus and get this done.
[234:52.96]Legally speaking, I did hell.
[234:54.61]Yeah, Jerma has to go, like, kiss his dog or whatever.
[235:02.71]Well, not right this second.
[235:07.37]Alright, are we doing this?
[235:10.83]Am I pressing the button?
[235:13.84]Yeah.
[235:16.91]Here we go!
[235:18.43]There's a pearl over here.
[235:22.59]I don't know why that was easier to find.
[235:26.30]I don't know why it always takes Jerma like six tries.
[235:28.96]Six tries to do what?
[235:30.10]What do I have?
[235:33.80]What, it takes me six tries?
[235:36.21]Forget it.
[235:37.21]Just forget it.
[235:37.77]You know what?
[235:41.60]Secured.
[235:42.42]Now to get the pod working.
[235:43.90]First, establishing a proper connection between the pod and the space rig.
[235:47.88]Set up the oblink.
[235:50.07]Jerma?
[235:50.99]Yep.
[235:53.25]If we're supposed to just both be subscribed to each other for, like, friendship points, aren't we just giving Twitch money?
[236:00.14]And then Jeff Bezos is that much closer to ruling the world?
[236:03.58]Yep.
[236:05.31]How about this?
[236:07.25]Just unsubscribe.
[236:08.41]However, did you know that if you subscribe to another streamer, it could be attacked right off?
[236:13.61]Yeah, but what if we just both unsub from each other, and I just, like, at a convention, just give you a $50 bill, and you give me a $50 bill?
[236:22.13]No, listen.
[236:23.73]You unsub, and then, like, every once in a while, you come in my chat, and you say, hey, gift me a sub, you fled, and you'll get one.
[236:33.84]And then you just leave.
[236:39.36]I got a girl.
[236:42.79]That was Jeff Bezos.
[236:44.11]Daddy Bezos gets his money.
[236:46.59]Get in the core board.
[236:48.75]That's the real goal.
[236:53.29]Alright, how about this?
[236:54.71]This is how this will work.
[236:56.43]If we're just giving subs to each other, then there's no reason for that.
[237:01.58]Just you give me $50 the next time I see you.
[237:05.88]So that'll cover the year, right?
[237:07.99]That's just called Christmas.
[237:10.63]No, but then, like, next year, like, in two years, I'll give you $50, and, like, oh, let's go to, like, lunch, and I'll take you to lunch.
[237:17.86]Okay, so it's birthdays instead.
[237:19.80]Like, I give you $50 of stuff on your birthday, and then you give me $50 of stuff on my birthday.
[237:24.42]Yeah, alright, so let's just celebrate each other's birthdays, then.
[237:27.00]Like, what's the big deal?
[237:28.42]When's my birthday?
[237:31.08]Um, when's my birthday?
[237:32.54]Just so I don't look like a bad person.
[237:33.94]Uh, let me think.
[237:36.53]He doesn't know.
[237:37.95]I don't know either.
[237:38.55]Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.
[237:41.49]He doesn't know.
[237:42.53]I don't know either, but... It's August 8th.
[237:46.59]That's not... That is definitely not true.
[237:49.49]Well, how do you know that?
[237:50.77]Your birthday?
[237:51.56]Because my birthday is in August.
[238:05.94]Yeah, and when is your birthday?
[238:07.46]I know everything that happens in August.
[238:09.10]Your birthday's in September.
[238:10.72]August 8th.
[238:12.62]I knew your birthday.
[238:14.27]That's what I'm saying.
[238:15.25]It was August 8th.
[238:16.47]Do you understand what I was playing there?
[238:18.01]Wow, did you really just take like a 1 in 12 shot?
[238:20.97]No, I knew it.
[238:22.27]It's August 21st.
[238:24.20]I was close enough.
[238:25.72]Yeah, you were close.
[238:35.94]When's Etalyx' birthday?
[238:38.52]I want an Ashley O. Bye.
[238:42.78]Etalyx' birthday is... I'll let Ster know when my birthday is.
[238:51.15]No, but I know your address.
[238:52.97]Is it January?
[238:57.97]I thought you'd know since it was last week.
[239:08.69]I know Etalyx's birthday, guys.
[239:10.45]Come on.
[239:10.83]He knows my birthday because that's when his mom showed up.
[239:13.20]Okay, I'm sorry.
[239:14.72]Wait, wait.
[239:16.98]Wait, what?
[239:18.92]That's when his mom showed up.
[239:27.90]But why would my mom come show up for his birthday?
[239:31.97]People have no idea what's going on right now.
[239:34.75]I don't know what's going on anymore.
[239:46.77]Alright, fine, Etalyx.
[239:49.21]When's Burger Boy's birthday?
[239:50.25]I have no idea.
[239:52.71]Have any idea?
[239:53.29]I've never even met Burger Boy.
[239:56.73]What?
[239:58.89]He dropped it on me for fun.
[240:02.32]What?
[240:02.60]No, he put it down and then you went and stood on it.
[240:06.16]What?
[240:07.06]What?
[240:09.12]I don't believe that you couldn't know it was going to land on you.
[240:11.80]Like, that's a ha-ha funny.
[240:15.56]I was too busy talking.
[240:16.68]That's a ha-ha funny.
[240:23.58]That's definitely just a ha-ha funny.
[240:25.26]Alright, at least revive me so I don't... Don't get him up.
[240:36.33]Please don't get him up.
[240:37.79]Somebody better.
[240:45.13]Thank you so much.
[240:45.83]He fell off the edge.
[240:48.10]He's going to die.
[241:14.10]yeah I'm getting back with all that's not you where'd you go wait 40 seconds wait what oh no okay I thought we had to leave this like doesn't hurt at all what that doesn't hurt you I mean it does but like barely wait no no I'm not supposed to be shooting you
[241:47.23]Is this what you really want at the very end?
[241:56.12]Do not get him up.
[241:57.58]Get me up.
[241:59.96]He's going to shoot me if I try to get him up.
[242:02.22]Come on.
[242:02.98]Come on, Ronnie.
[242:03.46]Get me up.
[242:04.78]How do I do the dance?
[242:07.22]He's trying to take everybody out, so you can't revive me.
[242:14.53]He's gonna get me!
[242:17.62]Achoo!
[242:18.74]Wait, no!
[242:19.38]Stirred definitely killed me for insolence there.
[242:25.64]No, don't let him get away with it!
[242:27.24]Etalyx, get out of here!
[242:28.38]Etalyx, I know your birthday!
[242:29.92]Etalyx, your birthday is... I made it!
[242:33.68]I'm on the ship!
[242:35.37]I wanna upgrade something!
[242:41.67]Oh, look at these dead guys.
[242:45.21]No fun in the medbay.
[242:47.11]Hey, it's fun.
[242:55.30]I actually do have to leave.
[242:57.34]I don't think I have time for another one.
[243:02.88]Do I?
[243:03.20]What time is it?
[243:05.86]No, I don't have time for another one.
[243:08.69]I do have time to do perks and stuff, though.
[243:10.61]But we just unlocked a new planet zone, new egg hunt complexity.
[243:16.07]How long is it going to take?
[243:17.65]Like six years.
[243:20.49]Which is how long it takes us to do these missions.
[243:22.39]Got the word complexity in the title.
[243:29.03]Will it take more than 30 minutes?
[243:33.29]No, speedrun.
[243:34.75]Alright, we have literally 30 minutes.
[243:40.02]I still want time to do the end of the stream.
[243:41.98]It's coming a little close.
[243:43.84]Alright, we can do it in 20 minutes, right?
[243:50.86]Yeah, speedrun.
[243:51.94]20 minutes.
[243:52.34]20 minute cutoff.
[243:53.16]Sweet.
[243:56.57]No, I got time.
[243:59.85]Just actually do the objective and don't throw things down a hill.
[244:04.77]When did I do that?
[244:07.15]Not talking to you.
[244:08.43]When have I ever directly talked to you?
[244:10.47]Don't even speak to me again.
[244:11.45]Dude, I don't think I've even used the satchel charges.
[244:15.42]Oh, I have a better weapon.
[244:16.82]Alright, let's do it.
[244:18.42]20 minutes.
[244:18.66]Alright, I'm looking at the clock right now.
[244:22.80]No, I got time.
[244:23.88]I thought it was later than it was.
[244:30.80]Save Otto.
[244:32.24]Give Otto a scratch on the butt and tell him it was from me.
[244:35.24]I will.
[244:45.09]Yeah.
[244:45.89]I have an appointment, so it's not like... It's not like I have to take him now or anything.
[244:52.17]There's an appointment.
[244:53.81]That's why I started so early.
[244:56.81]He's good.
[244:57.13]He's fine.
[244:58.37]He just needs to get checked out for something.
[245:01.15]Do you have any hobbies?
[245:02.66]Do you live in your house at all?
[245:05.62]Yeah, all the time.
[245:06.76]What?
[245:07.02]Yeah, all the time.
[245:09.56]What are you doing out there?
[245:11.36]Gambling?
[245:12.42]Reading?
[245:15.58]Gambling?
[245:16.52]Alright.
[245:19.30]Let's go.
[245:19.64]20 minutes.
[245:20.29]There's the dirt.
[245:24.09]Find the eggs.
[245:26.19]Eggs.
[245:26.61]Oh, this is one of those, like, board dirt...
[245:35.37]What happened to me?
[245:36.63]I was trying to dig to the egg as fast as I could.
[246:02.64]Whatever happened to speedrun?
[246:05.08]What?
[246:05.36]You're the one that died.
[246:06.24]I'm- I'm- I was trying to dig!
[246:08.12]Alright, we need eggs.
[246:18.27]What's the eggs look like?
[246:21.15]Going to the first one down here.
[246:23.65]First egg is... Is this the egg?
[246:26.12]No, this is like spaghetti.
[246:27.88]Hold on, a little bit more.
[246:31.32]Egg.
[246:33.12]I recently watched that video recently again recently the egg alright with the egg yeah I could love that it's like right around us here somewhere like above us egg egg I know it's on the map I see it it's just somewhere in here it's like right here inside these tentacles I'm pretty sure they're just like the uh pearls
[247:01.11]Yeah, here's one.
[247:02.47]Cool, one egg.
[247:04.35]What?
[247:04.75]Why is the world shaking?
[247:06.48]Oh, because they don't like it when you take their eggs.
[247:08.04]Alright, next one.
[247:08.94]I'm gonna find my way to the next one.
[247:10.50]There's some weird thing over here.
[247:11.74]I don't know if it's an egg.
[247:13.00]Yeah, there's one up this way.
[247:19.96]Here, follow me.
[247:22.14]Oh god, this is so stupid.
[247:23.88]I have no idea what could be the problem.
[247:24.97]It's like an infected mule.
[247:25.99]There's a bush over here.
[247:27.39]Red bush thing over here.
[247:29.45]Where is the supply bush?
[247:36.69]Nitro's full.
[247:38.63]Shit.
[247:41.13]Is the mule being taken?
[247:50.21]We got a big bug problem.
[247:51.59]Oh my god.
[247:52.43]Yeah, I'm up here on the cliff doing what I can.
[247:59.77]Oh boy, this is not good.
[248:10.62]Even in a speedrun, sometimes you gotta kill enemies.
[248:15.31]Sometimes.
[248:15.69]Is there a reason why you're mining and not, like, helping everybody?
[248:30.46]Yeah, I'm waiting for the enemies to come up here so I can go down there and resurrect you.
[248:35.58]He's playing, like, a clicker game.
[248:43.28]I don't buy it until I see it.
[248:44.22]Are you getting shot by, like, our friendly bot?
[248:49.74]No, it is not a friendly bot.
[248:51.18]There is a super giant robot that is shooting everyone down here, which is why we're all dead.
[248:55.11]God.
[249:12.29]And it doesn't like... Oh my god.
[249:14.19]I'm dead.
[249:16.39]Oh, that one has a health bar.
[249:17.47]That's a lot of health.
[249:20.28]There's nowhere to really run.
[249:22.87]Oh, man.
[249:23.43]It's like we're losing.
[249:24.13]The bot is killing us.
[249:25.41]Oh, no.
[249:25.77]Oh, wow.
[249:26.19]Done in 20 minutes.
[249:27.27]Kill the bot.
[249:27.97]Done so fast.
[249:28.99]So much health, I can't.
[249:30.77]So that's what was happening.
[249:32.43]Alright.
[249:32.79]Well, that was fun.
[249:33.29]My real problem was I res-drama first again.
[249:35.91]Look, guys, we really tried this time, okay?
[249:37.67]I swear.
[249:38.03]I mean, that's not true.
[249:41.66]What happened actually was nobody knew that we had to kill the robot that was possessed.
[249:46.86]No, Ronnie out loud said, wow, that's a corrupted bot.
[249:49.04]I think it was muted.
[249:50.72]Did you shoot?
[249:53.41]I didn't see you shoot at it.
[249:56.43]I've been shooting it.
[249:58.63]Oh, now you are?
[249:59.41]A squad stream, you can all see that I've been shooting it.
[250:02.54]I'm gonna get your Jerm.
[250:04.58]Thanks, Franny.
[250:05.72]Just gotta set my thing up here.
[250:08.50]Dang, I keep getting froze!
[250:17.67]I'm gonna kinda dig myself in a hole so I can have some cover.
[250:21.09]Star, did you beat Sekiro?
[250:23.97]I got to the last boss.
[250:25.09]Honestly, I hate that game.
[250:30.39]So I did not want to spend the time on the last guy.
[250:33.37]I'm trying to rez.
[250:34.93]Hold on.
[250:39.50]So sure, you can say you're the better gamer.
[250:42.94]I just was curious.
[250:44.36]I was curious.
[250:46.88]I didn't get your thoughts on it.
[250:49.64]My thought?
[250:50.78]I didn't get your thought.
[250:51.52]Apparently you don't like it.
[250:53.90]No.
[251:03.80]Whoa, that kind of hurts my head.
[251:06.33]Oh god, this guy looks like Short Circuit.
[251:10.53]Ugh.
[251:10.77]Alright, it's dead.
[251:15.29]Restart it.
[251:17.59]Yes, let's repair our enemy.
[251:23.51]Oh shoot, is it a walking turret now?
[251:25.41]Without any, like, obviously spoilers, I think it took me like, what, 50?
[251:31.31]60 attempts at that final boss?
[251:32.73]That's insane.
[251:36.43]There's a final boss?
[251:37.33]Spoilers!
[251:38.69]Spoilers!
[251:39.79]Well, I didn't want to say what it is.
[251:42.63]Did you fight... Did you fight, um... He's already... The big red fire demon?
[251:49.47]Yes.
[251:53.56]Okay, I'm not digging out of here.
[251:58.83]Only two out of six eggs.
[252:00.13]How long has it been?
[252:00.85]I don't know.
[252:02.41]I was reading chat.
[252:03.53]Hold on.
[252:06.01]I don't even know where I am.
[252:12.46]Okay.
[252:16.40]It's too dark.
[252:18.52]Alright.
[252:19.40]We need one more egg.
[252:21.77]In this area.
[252:22.17]There's another egg over here.
[252:23.23]Where is it?
[252:23.53]Yeah, I do.
[252:25.89]There's one up.
[252:26.69]There's one down.
[252:27.81]I'm going to get the one that's up.
[252:31.21]That is weird.
[252:31.87]I have yet to see an egg.
[252:33.13]I have no idea what they look like.
[252:35.16]Inside the giant flesh ball.
[252:37.38]You have to dig.
[252:39.46]And there's eggs inside of them.
[252:43.60]But if you press tab on your map, it shows you exactly where they are.
[252:47.72]And then you have to dig into them.
[252:50.82]Oh, I see.
[252:53.54]Alright, where was that one?
[253:04.91]Below.
[253:11.33]Anyone keeping track of how many times I've explained this?
[253:13.33]What the fuck?
[253:14.79]Did you get it?
[253:15.95]Um, at least one.
[253:17.09]Oh, did you- what'd you do with it?
[253:20.59]Thought I threw it down.
[253:26.83]How did you get in here?
[253:32.61]Nah, I'm coming back that way.
[253:34.81]Dude, it's- I'm fucking in the room of mirrors right now.
[253:44.33]Whoops.
[253:49.99]Whoa!
[253:51.87]No, wait, why?
[253:53.91]What the fuck?
[253:56.31]Goddamn Minecraft.
[253:59.94]Oh, shit.
[254:00.68]Alright, I'm fine.
[254:03.48]We're going to need a nitro tube.
[254:08.78]Yeah, I'm out of pretty much everything.
[254:10.36]I'm on it.
[254:15.89]Okay.
[254:16.95]I'm gaming.
[254:17.41]Where's the last two?
[254:20.27]Are they like up this way?
[254:28.45]You voting to kick me?
[254:30.47]I own the server.
[254:34.26]It's gonna take more than that.
[254:38.94]What is this bot doing?
[254:40.00]Because I have not seen it shooting at any bugs.
[254:41.88]It's kind of just running around.
[254:42.82]Oh, I'm skiing around now.
[254:45.64]Yeah, flag.
[254:47.06]This guy uses god mode in his own server.
[254:49.55]Alright, this is really weird.
[254:52.79]I really am on skis.
[254:53.91]Um...
[255:05.30]It's ice.
[255:05.70]I was going to say, aren't you from Boston?
[255:09.08]It's ice.
[255:11.64]I thought I was lagging.
[255:12.46]There's no ice in Boston.
[255:13.54]I thought I was lagging.
[255:15.06]Okay.
[255:18.44]Is there one more I can get that you have not got?
[255:20.50]I'm going to just go to the one behind me.
[255:22.40]There's two behind me here.
[255:32.39]This game reminds me of, like, Warframe.
[255:35.91]warframe yeah because you drop in you do an objective you're with four other people or three people and he's like oh you got you got a hack like three nodes and you're like how did I hack three of them what did everyone else do I'm over on this two I'm getting gold good job have you had prior experience though in warframe I didn't have any experience actually no I did I played for like five minutes with you and said no
[256:04.98]Not that the game is bad.
[256:06.70]I just was like, nah, I'm alright.
[256:09.62]Alright, this is bad.
[256:12.02]Just protect.
[256:12.66]Do we have a supply?
[256:18.06]I called one down earlier.
[256:21.34]So, it's way over there.
[256:23.60]Warframe's really, really cool.
[256:24.80]I just couldn't get into it.
[256:27.08]Swarm!
[256:27.38]I repeat, swarm!
[256:27.94]Alright, I think we're going to like it!
[256:38.44]Should we stick together for this swarm?
[256:39.76]We only need one more egg.
[256:42.12]And it's above.
[256:43.16]Four out of six eggs.
[256:44.50]Yeah, but there's one thrown down.
[256:46.14]There's one up here.
[256:47.05]You're gonna break the egg.
[256:50.15]We'll throw the other egg down here then.
[256:53.23]I don't wanna go get it.
[256:54.19]It's up above us.
[256:55.64]I don't wanna go get it.
[256:56.36]It's like a swarm coming.
[256:57.44]You want me to get stuck in a hole somewhere and die?
[257:11.91]Oh, now the big monster tank is shooting things.
[257:15.71]Alright, I'll go now.
[257:22.88]So where is it?
[257:23.46]I don't see it on the map.
[257:24.40]It's up behind it.
[257:25.54]It's up this way.
[257:26.68]I'm gonna go try to get it.
[257:31.12]I am the drill guy.
[257:35.75]What the fuck is going on?
[257:36.67]What?
[257:36.89]I can't go through this?
[257:39.29]Um, okay.
[257:40.31]Weird.
[257:41.71]Why?
[257:42.33]You trying to go up?
[257:47.42]I'm trying to go through it.
[257:48.16]I don't have any fuel.
[257:57.37]Shit.
[257:57.71]That's why.
[257:58.09]That's alright.
[258:01.17]He can do it.
[258:01.57]He's played Warframe before.
[258:08.21]Very good.
[258:08.85]Very good job.
[258:09.61]Very good.
[258:18.59]I turned around.
[258:20.15]Good.
[258:20.39]Where is the aforementioned supply pod?
[258:37.90]There is not a supply pod, I don't think.
[258:39.88]There's one back.
[258:44.51]There it is.
[258:45.83]Where's it down?
[258:47.49]All we have to do now is leave.
[258:50.97]Well, I have zero bullets, so... Let's get some bullets.
[258:55.67]Excellent.
[258:56.35]Eggs.
[258:58.84]Excellent.
[259:00.00]Get it?
[259:00.24]Egg.
[259:00.44]Egg.
[259:00.84]Egg.
[259:01.70]Egg.
[259:08.46]Egg.
[259:09.04]Here we go.
[259:09.32]That was better.
[259:09.80]What kind of hybrid egg was that?
[259:11.53]Well, Drakon's right here, so we don't even have to go far.
[259:18.91]Ster, can you tell Italic that he's the sexiest streamer here for me?
[259:23.27]Wow.
[259:24.47]I mean, I already knew that, but it still helps to hear.
[259:26.19]Oh, that was my mom.
[259:32.21]That's bullshit, by the way.
[259:41.10]I thought Starz was the only one up there.
[259:51.45]We're just like playing hide and go seek down here.
[260:01.81]I think what's actually happening is we're all relying on someone else to lead so we can follow and read chat.
[260:08.85]So when all of us just read chat, we just walk in circles like we're talking on the phone.
[260:13.95]How many of the eggs did I deposit?
[260:16.17]Two.
[260:18.59]I'm seeing a bunch of twos.
[260:22.03]I'm seeing a bunch of twos.
[260:23.49]Everyone in chat is writing, you put in like +2.
[260:26.13]You did two.
[260:26.89]He definitely did one.
[260:31.04]Look at my chat.
[260:32.48]My chat is all saying six out of six.
[260:34.96]I don't know.
[260:35.42]I don't think so.
[260:38.13]I don't think so.
[260:46.11]I just figured out what you were doing!
[260:47.47]Stern was trying to kill me, like I'm just standing there letting him shoot me because I'm that kind of guy.
[260:56.55]And he's trying to kill me before I get in the pod.
[260:59.43]Kill him.
[260:59.87]Kill star.
[261:00.29]Kill star.
[261:00.63]Get him.
[261:01.39]He's not going to get away with this shit.
[261:02.37]Kill star now.
[261:03.49]Everyone focus.
[261:04.13]All fire.
[261:08.52]It's like crime outline is just down there.
[261:13.88]Oh There's friggin dead guy come on
[261:37.65]Yeah, so it shows how many eggs.
[261:43.65]For the love of God.
[261:44.77]Can you please go?
[261:45.53]Take care of your dog.
[261:48.54]I know.
[261:49.96]That's exactly what's going to happen.
[261:51.02]I'm so worried about him.
[261:52.30]He's fine.
[261:54.20]Yeah, just another speed run.
[261:55.96]Speed run.
[261:56.72]No, no.
[261:57.28]I'm pretty sure the appointment was like at least 15 minutes ago.
[262:00.05]He's just really addicted to this game.
[262:01.45]Let's throw a tantrum.
[262:05.25]Alright, can somebody buy a drink before we go?
[262:07.25]Alright, I'm gonna buy a round.
[262:09.07]Hey, that was mine.
[262:12.39]Hey!
[262:12.57]These are mine!
[262:13.03]Get out of the way!
[262:14.23]What about mine?
[262:19.23]I want one!
[262:37.79]So when's the Sea of Thieves stream?
[262:46.11]Sea of Thieves.

[264:05.75]Daddy.
[264:07.19]That's the third time you've made that kind of weird reference during this.
[264:09.87]Just want to make sure everyone's aware that's number three.
[264:11.83]It's not weird if it's three.
[264:12.99]Then it's just like, that's my thing.
[264:15.03]That's just the thing you do.
[264:15.73]And you need to accept that.

[264:18.15]Well, thank you, Ster.
[264:19.61]You're going to be calling me Daddy after this stream.
[264:22.21]There's another one now.
[264:23.29]I'm not going to.
[264:23.71]Alright.
[264:25.42]Ronnie.
[264:25.66]Hey, it was great playing with you, Ronnie.
[264:27.44]Yeah, sure.
[264:28.08]Sure.
[264:28.32]Go take Otto to the vet, I guess, is what you're definitely doing.
[264:34.16]Yeah, I love you, Jerm.
[264:34.84]Jerm.
[264:35.56]Wait, are you implying that, like, I'm not going to do that?
[264:40.23]That I'm just making that, I'm making this up?
[264:41.99]Well, after what Etalyx just said, he said you were going to be calling him daddy.
[264:44.53]I was talking to you.
[264:46.04]I just left.
[264:46.54]I'm not, I ain't doing that anymore.
[264:49.64]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[264:52.04]A little bit on the shorter side today.
[264:54.42]But Otto kind of unexpectedly needs to go to the vet.
[265:00.56]He's having some skin issues and I don't want to have it just kind of fester.
[265:05.85]So I want to get him in there.
[265:08.73]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[265:10.57]Tomorrow we're going to do the movies again and we're going to try some mods.
[265:15.43]Probably starting around the normal time tomorrow.
[265:18.67]Maybe not.
[265:19.21]Maybe I'll start early tomorrow as well.
[265:22.08]We'll see.
[265:22.74]Not that early.
[265:23.56]Not as early as I started.
[265:24.52]I started like 11.30 this morning.
[265:27.56]But maybe a couple hours early tomorrow.
[265:29.56]We'll see.
[265:31.29]But I am going to the... We don't have very many bits, so I've got time to do it.
[265:35.65]I want to make sure I got out of there.
[265:38.55]To be able to do it.
[265:39.49]That was fun.
[265:39.93]That was Deep Rock Galactic.
[265:40.83]It actually was pretty fun.
[265:43.84]It's a nice take on the Left 4 Dead model.
[265:48.24]But let's go back to a few hours ago here.
[265:51.30]We had Elizabeth for three bucks.
[265:54.45]Uh, hello.
[265:55.45]I just wanted to chip in and say that I recently got my dream job as a community manager for a game dev, which also is sister company with the ones who publish Deep Rock.
[266:05.15]PogChamp.
[266:05.71]So cool to see you play it and loving all your streams.
[266:07.62]Oh, that's awesome.
[266:09.50]That's really, really cool.
[266:11.48]Congratulations on that.
[266:17.76]Thank you so much for the three bucks.
[266:19.54]Hell yeah.
[266:24.29]That was Elizabeth.
[266:26.43]Deep Rock Galactic.
[266:29.69]Jerma lied about the clown card.
[266:30.85]Gave five community subs earlier.
[266:32.09]Thanks for that.
[266:34.75]Didn't catch it.
[266:35.29]I was too busy being captured and soundboarded.
[266:40.13]Smelio, thanks for the five dollars.
[266:41.43]Hey Jerma, hope I'm doing this right since this is my first time donating, hopefully of many, since I figure I should start to pay you back for all the laughs since I started watching you in early 2013.
[266:52.64]I have a question, if that's okay.
[266:54.60]I'm lucky enough to be visiting America for the first time, Boston specifically.
[266:58.03]I was wondering if you had any tips, places to go, things to do, etc.
[267:02.73]Um... For Boston, I mean, the Museum of Science is awesome.
[267:06.78]If you've never been.
[267:08.54]Boston Museum of Science is really, really cool.
[267:10.08]A lot of interesting things to see and do there.
[267:15.88]Museum.
[267:16.39]Museum.
[267:16.85]Museum.
[267:19.27]Yeah, it is an awesome place if you have some time.
[267:22.15]You could spend all day there.
[267:24.81]You could spend more than one, two, three days there.
[267:29.85]So if somebody that was coming to America, to Boston, that's probably the first thing I would tell them to do.
[267:38.22]Yeah, Faneuil Hall is awesome too.
[267:39.80]A lot of shopping, a lot of great restaurants there.
[267:41.82]Yeah, there's a lot of cool things to do.
[267:49.71]The North End has some of the best Italian food and little eateries in the state.
[267:57.35]So, if you ever find yourself in the North End.
[268:02.34]There's a lot of cool things in Boston.
[268:08.20]But, I hope you have fun.
[268:09.78]I hope you have a good visit to the...
[268:20.07]United States of America.
[268:23.88]Thank you for the $5, Emilio.

[270:51.41]Definitely.
[270:52.44]Mini Eclipse gave $50.
[270:56.54]We touched upon it, but this stream makes my brain want to vomit.
[270:58.84]Keep up the disgusting work.
[270:59.90]I'm going to keep the disgusting work up.
[271:03.14]Hopefully it grosses you out even more.
[271:06.31]Thank you for the $50, Mini Eclipse.
[271:09.69]I didn't have an iPod I had a Zune And that's not a joke
[271:39.45]But thank you iPod Matt, hope you enjoy your iPod.
[271:43.29]Yeah, there's nothing wrong with the Zune.
[271:47.41]People think that's a joke though, when you tell them that.
[271:51.89]But, thank you.
[271:52.47]Thank you Marvash Magali for the 250, thanks for the EU stream!
[271:57.01]Sure, for sure.
[271:59.30]If I do them, and I'm able to do them, and I can kind of change the schedule around, and... I mean, obviously this stream was EU friendly.
[272:05.94]Not out of, essentially, choice, but out of necessity.
[272:10.44]But it's nice to do them every so often.
[272:11.86]I'm going to get the credits to roll by here.
[272:17.54]Thank you to all the subs.
[272:20.28]All the resubs and new subs tonight.

[272:28.95]Thank you so much.
[272:29.91]I will see you tomorrow.
[272:31.73]We're going to let this play out while I go over the last 3 or 4 bits here.
[272:37.91]And I'm right on time for Otto's appointment, so don't worry.
[272:42.02]I ended at the perfect time.
[272:46.48]But thank you to Origian3 for the 10 bucks.
[272:54.93]Stop reading this.
[272:55.93]Go save Otto.

[273:05.55]And I'm going to take him to it.
[273:06.32]And I'm going to be right on time for it.

[273:27.28]Anybody see Star's name yet?
[273:35.28]I haven't seen it pop up.
[273:38.04]We have to get documented evidence that it's happened.
[273:42.24]Because we needed the date.
[273:44.98]God damn, he's in my head now.
[273:46.96]I'm thinking about me doing that and it's happening.
[273:53.07]He's in there.
[273:54.11]He's in there laughing and mocking me right now.
[274:01.19]That was fun.
[274:08.30]He's in there rent-free, yeah.
[274:14.54]He cancelled the sub.
[274:16.32]No, he didn't.
[274:16.82]It was a gifted sub.
[274:17.54]You can't cancel a gifted sub, can you?
[274:21.23]You can't go into your account and cancel a gifted sub.
[274:24.91]Is that even possible?
[274:27.07]You can.
[274:28.79]Oh, shit.
[274:32.59]Did he?
[274:34.17]I wasn't looking in the first... 15 seconds of the credits.
[274:45.01]What if he canceled his sub to have, like, the token to give to somebody else?
[274:51.70]That's so funny.
[274:54.86]Is he, uh, is he still going?
[275:01.26]Is he still, is he gonna be streaming still for, uh... He is still going.
[275:12.57]Well, let's just raid him.
[275:14.74]Did I miss it?
[275:15.48]Did it happen?
[275:18.72]Alright, it happened.
[275:22.38]Alright, well, just a real raid star.
[275:24.55]He's just still going.
[275:26.29]So, even if he goes for, like, not that much longer, whatever.
[275:31.51]Y'all were just watching him anyways, right?
[275:35.87]Alright, let's raid star and be like, yay!
[275:38.70]Like, scream and, like, do a bunch of fucking emotes and stuff.
[275:46.05]Etalyx and Star are back-to-back.
[275:47.83]That's fucking hilarious.
[275:51.05]Alright guys, I will see you tomorrow.
[275:52.44]We're gonna play the movies again.
[275:53.30]We're gonna do some mods.
[275:55.54]And hopefully it's a fun time.
