[00:08.65]My headphones aren't in.
[00:11.30]Now they are.
[00:11.94]Well, now I can hear you.
[00:13.84]Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
[00:14.60]I can hear you now.
[00:18.62]Welcome back.
[00:19.94]How's everybody doing?
[00:20.54]Are you doing good?
[00:25.11]Cool.
[00:25.27]Cool.
[00:29.59]How do you submit levels for tonight?
[00:32.13]I kind of think we're just gonna... Just take them.
[00:35.86]When I request them.
[00:38.02]You know, like, hey.
[00:39.42]Let me see one.
[00:40.04]I don't really have a... A plan for this.
[00:44.24]Besides just pulling them out.
[00:48.26]But I want to do endless.
[00:50.30]Not on super expert.
[00:51.82]But on easy.
[00:54.49]Just to try.
[00:55.39]Just to start off.
[01:01.40]I just... Here's the thing about easy.
[01:03.83]So it's endless mode.
[01:07.63]How... Would you just play forever if you did it on easy?
[01:12.39]Isn't... Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't easy... Like, jump on the turtle's head and then walk to the flag?
[01:22.50]Somebody's gonna do it.
[01:24.36]Somebody's gonna just do Endless on Twitch for like seven straight days.
[01:28.51]On easy.
[01:29.75]And they're gonna do like four thousand levels.
[01:31.93]There's gonna be a record to break.
[01:38.78]Is it gonna be me?
[01:39.38]I don't think I want that record.
[01:46.10]Because first of all, you have to... You have to do that.
[01:50.08]And then you are the guy that... I'm the person... That beat all the levels on easy.
[01:57.47]Because it's... It's what I was capable of.
[02:01.13]At that point.
[02:04.08]This is... I gotta move this.
[02:05.08]This is all screwed up.
[02:06.84]There we go.
[02:11.24]You got this, man!
[02:12.16]It's all you!
[02:16.23]No, I don't got this.
[02:23.39]But anyways, uh, yeah, we're gonna do Mario Maker 2.
[02:26.82]We are going to do Dark Souls Randomizer tomorrow.
[02:29.70]I'm gonna try to get it to work.
[02:33.50]Today is Mario Maker 2, Dark Souls Randomizer is tomorrow.
[02:37.62]And then... I think I'm doing something on 4th of July.
[02:42.90]I'm pretty sure Kim and I want to do something.
[02:44.60]I think she wants to go out.
[02:46.34]So it'll probably be today, tomorrow, and then Friday.
[02:52.80]So we'll get these two days in a row here.
[03:00.91]Weapon randomizer, enemy randomizer, pretty much everything.
[03:04.01]I want to do weapon randomizer, enemy randomizer, boss randomizer.
[03:07.17]It's just going to be a total shit show.
[03:15.24]So, I have no idea.
[03:16.58]In Dark Souls Remastered.
[03:22.88]I'm going to do it solo.
[03:23.96]I'm not going to do it co-op with anybody.
[03:34.77]Don't forget about Reseteer.
[03:37.05]I will not.
[03:41.21]We got a lot of things to play.
[03:42.63]So, that's a good thing.
[03:46.88]You never want me to turn this stream on and be like, I have no idea what I'm doing.
[03:51.09]I have absolutely no clue.
[03:54.99]I got nothing.
[03:55.81]I got nothing.
[03:58.25]So, it's a good thing that there's at least three or four games that I can play whenever I want.
[04:04.64]That's every stream.
[04:07.78]What do you mean that's every stream?
[04:09.30]Every stream I... That's like one stream a month.
[04:13.41]Maybe.
[04:13.63]Maybe.
[04:15.65]I got nothing?
[04:16.99]When have you ever heard me say that?
[04:18.81]It's been, like, a month or two.
[04:20.85]Yeah, I don't play the same damn game every day.
[04:31.22]So sometimes you gotta figure out what you're gonna do.
[04:38.85]What are you talking about?
[04:49.64]Me?
[04:49.92]Yeah, you!
[04:50.38]Alright, let's go ahead and start it on easy.
[04:56.45]This is your punishment.
[05:06.45]How easy is this actually going to be?
[05:09.36]All jokes aside, is this absolutely impossible to lose?
[05:22.15]I don't know how to fly.
[05:23.03]Yeah, I do.
[05:25.09]Wee!
[05:26.77]Wee!
[05:28.13]Wait, it's supposed to be impossible to lose!
[05:44.38]Uh-oh, Hubris is kicking in.
[05:48.70]You can't lose.
[06:10.83]Happy 4th of July everybody!
[06:14.23]Hope you have some hot dogs and hamburgers!
[06:21.79]Up!
[06:32.62]I have the strangest urge to purchase a Wii now.
[06:36.86]Don't do that.
[06:40.78]That took me a minute.
[06:42.36]That's a long time.
[06:43.30]Alright, what's next?
[06:45.00]I like this.
[06:45.94]This is fun.
[06:51.20]Okay, here we go.
[06:51.96]What's the next one?
[06:56.14]This is like a bag of really, really mild jalapeño chips.
[07:00.80]There's no habanero in here.
[07:02.27]There's no ghost peppers in here.
[07:03.73]No, this is just mild jalapeño.
[07:07.87]This is like the default sauce at Taco Bell.
[07:09.83]I like it.
[07:12.56]Wait, hold on.
[07:13.16]Are you seriously getting a taco without like the Diablo sauce?
[07:16.24]Sometimes you don't want Diablo sauce.
[07:17.58]Sometimes I just want to fucking eat a taco.
[07:20.31]Look at this.
[07:20.65]This is delicious.
[07:21.57]Can I get like six extra packets of Diablo sauce, please?
[07:33.29]No.
[07:35.48]What's wrong with you?
[07:41.96]Nice mild flavor here Diablo sauce is mild sauce.
[07:55.78]Come on.
[07:56.20]Alright
[07:57.62]Okay.
[07:58.96]Settle down.
[08:00.52]I know that there are people that love to tout how... how strong they are with their mouths, and how they can eat anything, and they're... Diablo sauce ain't even intense, man.
[08:11.72]I gauge how much I like a hot sauce, whether or not it hurts my body.
[08:17.07]It hurts my face, and my face hurts, and I sweat, and it puts me in the hospital.
[08:22.17]That's how I determine if it's any good.
[08:38.91]Uh-oh, slow go- Hold on a minute here!
[08:43.49]What's the middle sauce called?
[08:50.07]That's a middle sauce right there.
[08:53.65]Mild.
[08:54.06]No, mild... Wait, mild's the middle sauce?
[08:57.50]No, it's not.
[09:02.20]Is mild the middle one?
[09:12.23]No, it isn't.
[09:12.83]It's mild, hot, fire, and then Diablo.
[09:20.15]Okay, right.
[09:21.25]Yeah, so hot is... Wait, what happened?
[09:34.84]You're supposed to go to the right in Mario levels.
[09:39.19]To the RIGHT in Mario levels.
[09:46.74]Oh.
[09:47.80]What is going on?
[09:48.50]This is salsa.
[09:55.90]That's not true.
[09:56.68]Some sauces can be really bad.
[10:02.63]This is V8 juice.
[10:14.83]A tomato's gonna be too acidic for people.
[10:17.05]Alright, how long am I gonna do this?
[10:22.46]How am I gonna keep this up?
[10:33.90]A packet of frost.
[10:34.96]Oh, RT game crowd coming in with the rain!
[10:42.79]What's up, man?
[10:43.51]Thank you.
[10:45.23]Just started, too.
[10:46.01]You guys are just in time.
[10:46.94]I don't know what you were just saying, but hopefully it was fun.
[10:54.42]Welcome, everybody.
[10:55.32]Thank you, RT.
[10:55.80]Are you doing Mario Maker?
[11:02.06]What's your... Alright, RT, if you're here, what's your favorite... How did I... I just got... I got tripled right there.
[11:08.54]I couldn't even move.
[11:09.18]What?
[11:12.59]This little salsa's got some fucking kick to it.
[11:21.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[11:22.29]Guys, guys, this is honest, but there was a bone in my fucking salsa, okay?
[11:25.50]It has nothing to do with how hard it is.
[11:27.94]I just, like, picked a fucking bone out.
[11:37.76]Oh, shit.
[11:38.34]God, there's bones everywhere.
[11:39.60]Hold on.
[11:48.70]I wonder if I saw some bones.
[11:50.60]Alright, am I gonna get bones?
[11:52.74]No.
[11:53.16]Not too bad.
[11:54.88]You died to vegan almond milk.
[12:00.60]I did not.
[12:01.20]That's not what that was.
[12:19.77]That's tricky, alright?
[12:22.11]This is not even an easy level.
[12:24.85]You just have to pick a door.
[12:30.65]This is gonna bring you all the way back to the level.
[12:32.75]No, this shit don't count.
[12:45.51]Does it count when the waiter sneezes in your food?
[12:48.27]No.
[12:49.31]No, god damn it!
[12:50.35]I was trying to go... I'm still eating it though.
[12:56.00]I'm still eating the food.
[12:58.00]I'm putting it in my mouth.
[12:59.54]Just skip it.
[13:04.50]You won't let me skip it.
[13:05.79]Oh my god.
[13:06.45]What a nightmare.
[13:07.87]Same pipe joke.
[13:14.58]Oh my god, wasn't it hilarious?
[13:15.98]Alright, I'm trying to see which one it is.
[13:19.91]We should go on this one.
[13:21.77]It's both of them, doesn't matter.
[13:30.99]What's wrong with you?
[13:31.67]I drank a bunch of milk earlier.
[13:41.72]I definitely shouldn't have done that.
[13:42.74]Alright, I'm not doing this anymore.
[13:45.20]I want some better salsa.
[13:50.89]Alright, let's go to... Anybody got anything fun?
[14:01.07]What's a decent one?
[14:01.99]Alright, I'm just going to pick this one.
[14:11.23]Let's see what this one is.
[14:14.97]Yeah.
[14:15.83]When I call for him, I'm just going to use them.
[14:19.43]So this is.
[14:20.13]Okay.
[14:39.42]Searching for courses.
[14:41.22]This is called Extreme Desert Bus.
[14:47.57]Uh... Alright.
[14:50.27]0.3% people have completed this?
[15:00.87]This is a speed run.
[15:02.13]Reach the goal in a Koopa Troopa car.
[15:09.55]Okay, but check park right forward check it no, alright Alright, here we go Really is that gonna hit my head?
[15:31.14]No
[15:37.06]What?
[15:39.28]How do you get over this?
[15:40.06]I have to jump on top of this and then...
[16:08.68]Do I get another car?
[16:17.00]How the hell are you supposed to do this?
[16:19.20]You gotta be going fast.
[16:23.40]Alright, I understand what it wants me to do here.
[16:25.19]Alright, hold on, I got it.
[16:33.51]Ow.
[16:36.87]Damn it!
[16:45.51]Do I get a second car?
[16:48.06]Alright, here we go.
[16:51.46]Nice.
[16:54.88]Wait.
[16:56.32]Oh, fuck.
[17:14.96]I did it!
[17:16.40]There's a car right there.
[17:48.89]Desert bust.
[17:49.64]Desert jog.
[17:50.84]More like it.
[18:15.97]Do I need a mushroom?
[18:16.81]What?
[18:19.99]Oh.
[18:20.83]That's not good.
[18:22.19]That's not good.
[18:25.73]Oh, no.
[18:27.11]I have to have the car.
[18:29.90]Well, how am I supposed to make that jump?
[18:32.02]This is just getting over it.
[18:42.92]Damn it.
[18:43.64]You can only bump the car like three times.
[18:51.61]I'm gonna get stuck here for like a half an hour just trying to do this one jump.
[19:06.13]Oh!
[19:06.41]I just had it.
[19:07.05]Okay, you have to go tap tap.
[19:11.48]Ready?
[19:12.88]Got it.
[19:13.34]Okay.
[19:13.54]Can I make the whole thing?
[19:21.08]Imagine people actually speedrunning this.
[19:23.72]Holy shit, this would be ridiculous.
[19:25.90]It's gone.
[19:27.83]Gone.
[19:31.03]You gotta be perfect, or it's not gonna happen.
[19:47.94]Shit!
[19:53.46]Shit!
[19:57.23]Shit!
[19:57.33]I don't have to go fast.
[20:09.83]No!
[20:10.63]Stop bouncing off the wall!
[20:15.41]Ooh!
[20:15.91]Alright, now what?
[20:24.86]Holy shit!
[20:26.22]No!
[20:33.52]I can do it I can do it, I just gotta be more careful Slow down, don't be an idiot Ow, my head
[20:55.75]I used to have bunk beds with my brother and I used to do that all the fucking time.
[20:59.16]I do it already.
[21:02.62]Nobody- and by the way, top bunk sucks.
[21:05.48]You have a bad dream and you wake up and you end up in the fucking ER and you smash your head against the ceiling.
[21:18.30]Just do it again, just do it again, do it again.
[21:22.78]No, top bunk is not good, because every time you're in the top bunk, when you close your eyes and you fall asleep, and then you wake up in the morning or whenever, your face is three inches away from the ceiling, and you're just like, every single time you have a mini panic attack.
[21:48.16]And you can't be too panicky, because if you're too panicky, you're gonna freak out and bump your face and break your nose.
[22:00.99]Alright, we're good, we're good.
[22:02.23]What about up here?
[22:03.19]Secret?
[22:04.45]Yep.
[22:25.79]Damn it.
[22:26.13]I thought I had it.
[22:26.82]Clean.
[22:29.34]No, not clean.
[22:30.82]Clean it up.
[22:34.56]No, top bunk is never fun.
[22:35.90]It really isn't.
[22:44.02]Shit!
[22:54.56]And bottom bunk is, bunk beds all suck.
[22:58.08]There is no good bunk bed, because guess what?
[23:00.12]You've got, if you're on the bottom bunk, you've got a potential fucking landslide hazard of the person above you collapsing on top of you and crushing you.
[23:11.82]Sometimes, I remember, I had the bottom bunk before, and you'll hear the person above you rolling around like, creaking and shit, and you're like, this thing's gonna fall and fucking pancake me, I'm dead.
[23:24.93]I don't want somebody right above me, like 300 fucking pounds above me.
[23:29.39]That thing is going to crush you.
[23:31.21]Like the Terminator.
[23:40.68]Not to mention, what if somebody pisses the bed?
[23:44.62]You're going to get sprinkled on.
[23:46.02]Pee is going to seep through that mattress and hit you right in the head.
[23:55.91]Alright, I got it.
[23:58.10]There it is.
[23:58.86]Up.
[23:59.30]No!
[24:05.32]You dick.
[24:11.95]No, bunk beds are not... I don't like that.
[24:18.31]Alright, I'm back here.
[24:20.43]Easy.
[24:20.79]Gentle.
[24:21.27]Gentle.
[24:21.88]Gentle.
[24:22.32]Okay, here it is.
[24:24.16]I'm out.
[24:24.44]I'm dead.
[24:26.98]You gotta be going faster than that.
[24:28.42]Oh, I'm gonna get addicted to this level and I'm gonna fucking sit here all night.
[24:37.07]I would rather sleep in a twin bed with like four people than have to worry about somebody like some 400 pound dude above me in a bunk bed about to collapse on me.
[24:48.71]I don't know why I'm assuming that the person above you in your bunk bed is 400 pound.
[24:53.84]That person would be on the bottom.
[24:55.78]But you never know, some people like at the top bunk.
[24:59.78]Oh my god.
[25:00.48]Okay, I need to pay attention.
[25:18.07]Let me try to beat this stupid fucking video game.
[25:25.19]Damn it.
[25:30.85]I'm fucking losing my mind.
[25:32.11]Alright, let me at least try to get to that spot one more time.
[25:38.80]This level is hours long.
[25:40.18]Well, let me at least try to get to the deck.
[25:50.82]I didn't... I didn't get that?
[25:52.04]How did I not get that?
[25:54.03]I was touching it.
[26:01.09]Go up.
[26:09.09]Ow.
[26:12.90]Moving to the rest of the screen?
[26:13.82]No, I'm not gonna- What's with this forward momentum bullshit?
[26:17.18]Like, I'm obviously going forward.
[26:18.24]Like, why does it hang like that?
[26:19.86]It's the car mechanics.
[26:21.82]They need to fucking patch it.
[26:22.66]It's broken, I think.
[26:25.02]Here we go.
[26:35.44]Oh, it's the car mechanics.
[26:36.48]Car mechanics is what I thought.
[26:37.86]I heard.
[26:38.10]I was on the forums.
[26:40.22]I was on Super Mario Nintendo forums.
[26:44.73]There's a huge apology post from Nintendo about the car mechanics, but I don't know.
[26:48.28]Specifically, it was... It was written in Japanese, so I had to translate it, so I might not have the whole picture, but... They were saying that the car mechanics were, like, all messed up, and that they were working on it.
[27:10.03]Goddammit, why?!
[27:11.16]This first jump is so finicky!
[27:18.82]You're wasting the time of your life playing this game.
[27:21.90]This life.
[27:22.58]This level.
[27:23.16]You're wasting your life.
[27:27.46]Don't remind me, Bob!
[27:31.17]Oh my god.
[27:31.89]I'm gonna jump on top of it.
[27:34.01]I'm gonna jump on top.
[27:42.14]That's probably more reliable, right?
[27:49.43]No.
[27:52.01]I mean, I can get over them now.
[27:54.03]You have to jump from this to this one.
[28:10.94]How?
[28:11.56]I'm gonna try it.
[28:15.62]Here we go.
[28:16.86]Trying to get this part clean is important.
[28:19.82]It's right here.
[28:21.08]Bang.
[28:21.42]Got it.
[28:21.82]Okay.
[28:22.66]Clean.
[28:24.64]Worst part is decent.
[28:28.66]Shit.
[28:32.01]No.
[28:33.11]How do I just go... Alright.
[28:38.61]Back to it.
[28:39.27]I gotta make this jump, jump, jump.
[28:42.25]And then all the way.
[28:43.55]So we gotta do it early.
[28:46.53]Stupid.
[28:47.37]It's not gonna be fast enough.
[28:48.21]Ooh!
[28:52.45]What?
[28:57.04]What do you mean?
[29:06.54]How do I get that car?
[29:08.82]What?
[29:10.58]Does he show up behind me?
[29:25.50]Hold on, I can't... I have to park the car in front of that thing?
[29:31.36]Are you serious?
[29:49.07]He doesn't know?
[29:50.21]Tell me!
[29:50.69]Tell me!
[29:51.27]I want to know!
[29:53.91]I don't know, I don't know, but what do I not know?
[29:56.09]Tell me.
[29:57.75]Is it important?
[29:58.86]Is it critical information that I don't have?
[30:00.98]Tell me.
[30:01.28]So park it.
[30:10.14]Shit.
[30:13.21]That's not gonna fucking happen.
[30:20.73]Wait, should I just drive over and turn left?
[30:27.21]Turn on comments.
[30:32.97]Shit.
[30:37.01]Comments aren't gonna help me, I don't think.
[30:47.72]Damn.
[30:49.48]This is the hardest jump in the level right here.
[30:52.12]Just trying to get on top of this from here.
[31:07.90]Pixel perfect.
[31:09.00]Pixel perfect.
[31:10.42]Pixel perfect.
[31:18.88]Oh shit.
[31:21.30]This thing ain't gonna fucking last any longer.
[31:28.63]Did I just... What just happened there?
[31:30.87]Did I... Why did I just throw the car like it was an item?
[31:38.02]What just happened?
[31:41.04]I just ghost-rid the car into the wall.
[31:43.10]I ejected out somehow.
[31:44.64]Oh, I know why.
[31:45.26]Because I leaned forward and my trigger button hit the desk.
[32:12.19]Gave a rage.
[32:13.73]What the fuck keeps happening?
[32:15.47]Seriously, that's so irritating.
[32:18.81]What am I bumping?
[32:19.67]Okay, something's wrong.
[32:24.51]Something's wrong here.
[32:25.33]Something's wrong.
[32:25.98]There's actually something wrong.
[32:27.70]There's something wrong.
[32:29.28]What's wrong?
[32:32.86]Okay.
[32:38.28]Found out what was wrong.
[32:58.53]Good?
[32:58.75]I'm good?
[33:06.02]Good?
[33:06.60]No.
[33:06.74]My controller wasn't plugged in.
[33:13.16]No.
[33:13.34]Alright, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[33:14.32]I'm gonna get it right here.
[33:16.38]This is it.
[33:25.33]Oh!
[33:29.93]What the fuck is happening right now?
[33:42.12]Well... Something ain't right here.
[33:53.33]Well, there's sub only.
[33:54.33]What the fuck?
[34:02.09]What the fuck was that?
[34:03.21]Well, it turns out there's only 30 real users in this chat.
[34:17.16]That was fucking crazy.
[34:20.32]Settle down!
[34:20.94]What are you doing?
[34:40.10]That was a lot of clapping.
[34:41.48]Yeah, it was.
[34:42.08]Now, hold on.
[34:42.54]Now I gotta pay attention to the game.
[34:46.68]That was like... Okay, that's the equivalent of you looking down and seeing 300 ants on the ground.
[34:50.22]You're like, hold on.
[34:50.92]Wait, what the fuck is happening right now?
[34:53.02]Hold on, hold on.
[34:53.56]I gotta take... There's ants in here.
[34:58.23]Ugh.
[35:01.97]Alright, start from back here.
[35:10.96]We're gonna have to keep it on for a little while.
[35:25.56]Just use the Dev Path?
[35:26.96]I'm not gonna use the Dev Path.
[35:31.59]I will only use the Dev Path when you hear me say... Nah, I'm not doing this anymore.
[35:37.11]Nah, this is fucking stupid.
[35:38.43]This is fucking dumb.
[35:39.21]This is fucking stupid.
[35:40.05]Once I start doing that, then yeah.
[35:43.84]Once I start using the F word as every other vowel, then yeah.
[35:53.58]I swear to God, I don't understand this one.
[35:55.91]This one feels like it works 40% of the time.
[36:05.90]How do you do the jump at the end over here?
[36:07.58]You have to turn and then jump and then turn?
[36:10.96]Oh, there's something wrong.
[36:19.94]There's something wrong.
[36:26.60]I'm gonna give this 10 more tries, and then I'm actually done.
[36:28.70]I'm gonna move on.
[36:29.74]This is not gonna be one of those streams where I sit here for an hour and 45 minutes trying to get through.
[36:34.32]It's not gonna happen.
[36:35.23]Oh my god, there's so much more to see.
[36:38.91]There's so much more to see.
[36:46.03]It is very addicting though, and that's the problem.
[36:52.71]All these levels are just so addicting.
[36:55.04]Because they're so meticulous.
[36:58.82]And... Alright, don't blow it.
[37:04.46]How do I get this?
[37:05.53]I have to turn in mid-air.
[37:07.63]And try to not crash?
[37:11.83]I... I... I ain't going down.
[37:21.62]Desert butts.
[37:28.73]Nine more.
[37:29.59]Yes, keep track, because I want to be held accountable for that.
[37:32.33]Why does it not work half the time?
[37:48.36]No, I'm trying to think of an effective way to...
[38:02.38]No.
[38:10.91]Fuck.
[38:11.25]Why won't it jump when I land on this?
[38:13.29]I'm spamming the button, too.
[38:21.84]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[38:25.26]Don't give subs!
[38:26.16]What are you thinking?
[38:32.35]Don't do it!
[38:32.87]Don't do that!
[38:39.37]What are you doing?
[38:39.95]What are you thinking?
[38:44.88]Alright, I'm starting to hate this level.
[38:46.86]Only because of this part.
[38:49.26]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[38:49.62]I hate it.
[38:50.72]I'm getting there.
[38:51.14]I've only got seven more levels.
[39:04.45]I don't even understand!
[39:05.56]Oh god, I don't know where to go.
[39:20.91]I... Okay.
[39:24.33]Let me try this one more time.
[39:30.27]Come on, I have to get over there from here and then jump again.
[39:33.37]Oh.
[39:33.53]My.
[39:34.19]Fucking.
[39:34.71]God.
[39:37.53]Six more.
[39:37.93]I ain't doing this all night.
[39:55.24]I don't have this figured out either.
[40:02.16]The creator of this level is laughing at you?
[40:06.09]Hey, hey, dude, like... Yeah, you made these, like, fucking crazy awesome levels and shit.
[40:11.53]But, hey, can you, like, make one... Just, like, edit this one?
[40:14.63]And make it, like, 10% easier and give it to me?
[40:17.55]And then I'll be, like, on stream beating it?
[40:20.08]I'll be like, what the fuck, dude?
[40:23.34]This is so hard, but, like, nice.
[40:24.92]Fuck, this level's sick, though.
[40:26.48]Which one is this one?
[40:29.22]I...
[40:32.56]I don't know what to do here!
[40:34.00]I have to land and then... but if I crash... Turn before landing?
[40:56.83]That's what I was trying to do, but I lost momentum and went down the hole.
[41:12.30]I have to figure out, because when you jump, you just crash into that wall.
[41:15.64]I do it every time.
[41:21.53]No!
[41:22.63]These stupid Treadmill!
[41:24.25]Come on!
[41:26.59]I'm getting YouTube angry!
[41:28.39]What the heck's going on here?!
[41:31.36]Yikes!
[41:33.96]Alright, right here!
[41:34.54]Jump down!
[41:36.24]That was it, but I didn't jump again.
[41:37.40]My controller broke.
[41:40.27]no it's not no no it's not gonna that doesn't work it takes so long for your car to turn around but by the time you turn around again you're already down the hole it takes like a full second and a half to turn the car over and go forward I'm just gonna crash into the wall you'll see
[42:16.50]No, fuck this jump.
[42:18.50]Give me another copy of this.
[42:19.62]Except, like, drop that... This thing here by, like, 8%.
[42:22.38]Shit.
[42:22.52]Okay.
[42:22.69]Okay.
[42:41.96]Here it is.
[42:42.32]I'm just gonna crash directly into the fucking wall.
[42:45.02]Because I obviously am not capable of doing this.
[42:49.68]Okay, that's one crash.
[42:51.16]Two more crashes allowed.
[42:54.25]Oh my god.
[43:03.31]See, you have to perfectly land on that.
[43:05.15]Turn left and then turn right.
[43:07.75]On the dime.
[43:16.24]Well, eventually.
[43:18.31]When the scientists can come together to beat this.
[43:25.53]Now I know why it has a 0.64% completion rate.
[43:36.48]That's probably the percentage of scientists that exist on Earth right now.
[43:42.34]I would probably say that 0.64% of all people are probably a scientist.
[43:46.66]Right?
[43:46.92]Alright, this is my last try.
[43:58.99]Last try before I skip the level.
[44:09.89]Wait, the dev is giving advice in the chat.
[44:14.67]Dev is giving advice.
[44:15.57]Well, I can't see.
[44:20.07]There's a million names going by.
[44:27.89]Dev.
[44:28.62]How can the dev... Is the dev a sub?
[44:38.31]He's like, I gotta sub, this motherfucker's doing this all wrong.
[44:41.93]Alright, so how do I get past this first jump?
[44:49.49]Give me the secrets.
[44:53.64]You gotta land on that conveyor, turn around, and then spam jump at the end.
[44:56.64]Fuck.
[44:59.02]That's too hard.
[45:05.84]Spam jump.
[45:10.10]It's too high.
[45:11.24]I'm gonna try.
[45:17.66]I'm gonna try to limp.
[45:18.44]But the conveyor belt is so scary to... Don't backseat him?
[45:25.27]That's not backseating.
[45:26.31]That's advice.
[45:30.32]If you were to tell me that what I was doing was wrong, therefore do my way, and that's right, that's backseating, but saying, hey, like, you know, if you do it this way, that is what I'm talking about.
[45:39.43]So stop backseating me, please.
[45:44.18]I swear to God, man.
[45:45.18]No, I gotta get up there and try this one more time.
[45:57.55]I have a strict don't backseat me policy in the channel.
[46:07.54]I'm trying to spam jump up here!
[46:18.22]It's been like an hour.
[46:19.28]I don't want to do this all day.
[46:21.88]This is the first viewer level.
[46:23.42]I can't do... I gotta give like a time limit.
[46:37.11]Why?
[46:43.54]Why?
[46:44.98]I keep hitting my head on the goddamn bunk bed, I swear to god.
[47:07.46]I'm of the opinion that you just throw dice in the air to get that jump.
[47:11.26]Did you get a six?
[47:13.46]You get to go.
[47:18.89]Alright, here we go.
[47:19.85]Time to actually get across.
[47:27.91]No, you motherfucker!
[47:30.07]Why?
[47:31.09]God, why does it bounce so far back?
[47:42.74]You launch backwards, always in that hole.
[47:59.19]Oh shit.
[48:03.13]Oh my god.
[48:04.43]Like, un-fucking-bearable.
[48:06.11]Un-fucking-bearable.
[48:08.07]This level was designed to make you hate the game.
[48:22.23]That's what it's here for.
[48:24.39]And it's not working.
[48:25.11]I'm not gonna let it work.
[48:28.64]Mario Maker 2 is fucking sick.
[48:29.98]I'm not gonna let some maniacal, maniacal developer try to take the fun away from me.
[48:46.26]How do you fast forward a screen?
[48:47.92]Well, it's a new feature on Twitch.
[48:50.00]What you do is you have to... Never mind.
[48:59.53]Rude!
[48:59.89]I didn't say anything!
[49:00.81]I didn't even say anything!
[49:02.54]What do you mean rude?
[49:04.06]I didn't even open my mouth!
[49:10.00]He was about to say something rude.
[49:11.80]No, I wasn't!
[49:15.91]Okay, don't screw it up again.
[49:20.82]I screwed it up again, but it's okay.
[49:21.80]Okay, here we go!
[49:23.86]God!
[49:26.16]No way.
[49:35.11]No way.
[49:36.41]No way.
[49:38.19]Why did you do this?
[49:39.71]Why did you do it like this?
[49:42.71]Why did you, like, make that extended by, like, one block?
[49:46.38]Why does he have to... Why do you have to do it like this?
[50:02.35]Why?
[50:03.45]The dev is in the chat.
[50:04.55]He can't quit.
[50:05.25]If I quit now, then, like, I mean, I... This is his master creation.
[50:09.61]This is the master creation.
[50:10.83]Okay.
[50:19.94]HOLY SHIT!
[50:20.82]NO!
[50:21.46]UGH!
[50:28.75]It was there, but it's too perfect.
[50:38.42]You need to be too perfect.
[50:40.60]Nobody's perfect.
[50:46.78]It was really close.
[50:47.82]But then I have to do the whole second half of the level, and I'm not prepared to do that shit.
[50:54.12]I just looked at chat, because somebody said... No, there is no raid right now.
[50:58.86]Alright, everybody relax.
[51:04.39]What the fuck?
[51:12.51]Even if I get through...
[51:17.07]Even if I get through this part, which I'm not going to.
[51:20.49]You know how much... I mean, maybe I could.
[51:23.49]If I spent another two hours here, I'd probably do it.
[51:37.37]Alright.
[51:38.27]If I crash the car, it's over.
[51:39.75]The thing's going to explode.
[51:42.51]So, I'm going to crash it right now.
[51:45.46]Holy fuck, okay.
[51:46.88]Nope.
[52:00.41]Ugh.
[52:05.35]Um, so remember we talked about sauces and shit?
[52:08.41]And how I was on mild sauce, where I was eating like a tomato out of a can?
[52:13.50]This is buying pure capsaicin from the internet and putting it in your eyes.
[52:27.63]Yeah, I kind of want to just go back and eat my taco.
[52:42.65]Fortnite.
[52:45.19]Why, okay, why would Fortnite be here?
[52:50.94]Somebody gifted Fortnite a sub.
[52:52.88]Yeah, you can gift anybody a sub.
[52:57.46]Imagine if Fortnite, the Fortnite channel raided the stream.
[53:01.20]That would be so stupid.
[53:10.62]Alright, I'm gonna get it.
[53:11.54]Jump now.
[53:16.09]God damn it, how do you do this?
[53:19.33]How are you supposed to do that?
[53:21.67]It's not possible.
[53:22.57]I don't understand how that's even possible.
[53:35.29]Turn and spam and...
[53:50.53]It's been an hour.
[53:51.33]It has almost been an hour.
[53:52.07]I'm gonna give it at least... But this is... I can't just, like, give up.
[54:01.94]Let me just get to the end of this.
[54:04.16]Can we... Can we just fucking pretend that if I get inside that exclamation cube that I beat it?
[54:20.53]Oh.
[54:21.25]My.
[54:22.47]Fucking.
[54:23.47]God.
[54:32.20]Why do I turn around?
[54:33.42]Because the dev told me I had to do that, because if I don't turn around I drive di- It's a conveyor boat, so I drive directly into the wall!
[54:40.67]And then I bounce off into the hole!
[55:04.57]That wasn't the dev?
[55:10.55]You have to, like, land right on the edge and jump immediately.
[55:15.56]Oh my god.
[55:16.20]Okay, I'm not reading chat right now.
[55:17.66]I got... You know, sometimes I think about this.
[55:27.04]Why would I... Why?
[55:28.68]Why would I want to sit here and stick small needles into myself?
[55:35.15]You know what I mean?
[55:35.91]This is just sticking like five thousand small needles into my skin.
[55:43.12]There's a whole game here.
[55:44.62]There's an entire video game here.
[55:47.12]I don't need to do the needle level.
[56:08.03]You need to do the needle level.
[56:09.57]No!
[56:09.87]Why do we have to do needle levels?
[56:11.39]Why can't we... What if I happen to World 1-1?
[56:14.03]Okay?
[56:15.67]What happened to World 1-1?
[56:17.79]When everyone would just enjoy themselves and I beat 1-1.
[56:19.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:21.14]Now the video gaming in 2019 is... That's not enough.
[56:27.00]I need to do World 1-1 blindfolded while you stick me with pins.
[56:34.45]We're just... Yeah, we're in constant conflict.
[56:53.29]This is the last try.
[56:54.31]Last try.
[56:54.67]This is it.
[56:58.09]This is it.
[56:58.95]Everyone's going to say, oh, you're a quitter.
[57:00.36]I can't believe that.
[57:01.22]I beat the last boss.
[57:02.28]That's all I care about.
[57:03.10]I don't care about this.
[57:04.40]I will eat those needles.
[57:05.48]I won't eat these ones.
[57:07.28]Oh, God.
[57:07.86]No, no, no, no.
[57:08.44]Don't cry.
[57:17.34]I don't care if you call me on Twitter.
[57:18.48]It doesn't matter.
[57:22.63]I already had my 2,000 calorie a year diet of needle games.
[57:26.75]Sekiro's... I beat the last boss.
[57:28.19]Sekiro, that's all I... I know people that haven't done that.
[57:31.64]Personal people... I know people personally that haven't done that.
[57:33.52]It's like, what do you got?
[57:34.14]Come on.
[57:35.00]Can't do this one?
[57:35.66]Whatever.
[57:47.55]That game's easier than Dark Souls.
[57:49.08]Oh, God.
[57:51.12]How dare you?
[57:56.86]I did it!
[57:57.30]What do I do?
[57:58.68]What do I do?
[58:00.00]What do I do?
[58:01.26]Where's the death?
[58:02.32]Where's the death?
[58:09.14]Turn?
[58:09.62]What do we turn?
[58:11.79]Go in the box.
[58:16.63]What do you mean turn?
[58:17.45]I don't know what you're talking about.
[58:18.82]Turn around when you hit the block.
[58:24.08]What do you mean?
[58:25.10]I don't... Does it come with me?
[58:28.34]Drive into it.
[58:29.16]Go slowly into the box.
[58:30.40]But I can't go slow.
[58:31.35]Just freaking fast.
[58:33.93]180 the car into the box.
[58:35.97]Just go forward.
[58:36.73]I can't... Okay.
[58:46.62]Now what do I do?
[58:50.94]What do I do?
[58:51.44]If I hit one more thing, I'm dead.
[58:56.67]Is there a checkpoint?
[58:58.87]There's gotta be a checkpoint here, right?
[59:02.85]Oh shit!
[59:04.18]I have one more hit and this fucking Model T is gonna fall apart.
[59:16.31]But now what?
[59:17.15]Hold on.
[59:33.41]Jesus!
[59:35.49]Oh my god!
[59:41.61]Oh my god, it's so hard.
[60:02.98]No, it's right here.
[60:07.55]What?
[60:07.87]How the fuck are you supposed to get there?
[60:09.95]You... Really?
[60:11.41]Really?
[60:11.81]Like, no.
[60:12.57]No way.
[60:13.03]Uh-uh.
[60:14.29]I ain't going over any more cakes.
[60:16.09]No, fuck these cakes.
[60:17.13]I'm not doing it anymore.
[60:18.01]I'm not doing any fucking vanilla frosting bullshit.
[60:20.25]I'm out.
[60:43.39]I need a fresh car going in there.
[60:51.42]Fresh car.
[60:52.06]Alright.
[60:52.52]How did I do this last time?
[60:53.56]You have to jump, like, up and then... I don't even know.
[60:56.12]It was dumb luck.
[60:58.32]Broken clock is right.
[60:59.58]Twice a day.
[61:00.94]And I can't even do this shit.
[61:11.37]Here we go.
[61:16.82]No, it was... I can do it.
[61:18.70]I know I can.
[61:19.32]I can do it.
[61:20.78]Not if it's a digital clock.
[61:22.06]But if you hit... Yeah.
[61:23.06]But I'm talking about an analog clock.
[61:27.61]It's been an hour.
[61:28.33]But it's alright.
[61:28.87]This is like... This is... I'm in it.
[61:46.91]I'm getting pretty good at this part.
[61:50.81]I just gotta nail this down.
[61:53.15]You gotta do it early, early... Oh, fuck me in... You gotta jump high and then turn and then...
[62:33.86]Here we go.
[62:38.28]You fucking asshole.
[62:53.61]I just... It's like anything else.
[62:55.43]Once you get to a certain point, your brain just refuses to let you leave.
[63:00.16]Because it's sunk cost fallacy.
[63:03.04]But it's not even sunk cost.
[63:04.62]Because I've seen some... I've seen some progress.
[63:13.01]Okay, if I was driving into this first wall over and over again, maybe.
[63:16.13]But I got up there.
[63:17.51]I just want to see it.
[63:18.93]I want to do it.
[63:19.53]I want to be the 0.6% of people that have done it.
[63:25.25]I can do it.
[63:34.25]Still in Anor Londo.
[63:38.29]But we don't care.
[63:39.11]I care.
[63:41.23]This is a personal goal for me.
[63:57.80]Slow down.
[64:03.76]It's too hard.
[64:19.03]Whatever, people are gonna call me out.
[64:20.35]It doesn't matter.
[64:23.79]Doesn't matter.
[64:24.21]Hey, you know what?
[64:25.07]I'll tell you why I don't care.
[64:26.59]This is why I don't care.
[64:27.17]Because 0.64% of people have beaten it.
[64:30.51]So if there's 3,600 people watching this, only like 8 of you have done this.
[64:35.43]So I don't care.
[64:40.04]That doesn't bother me at all.
[64:46.30]I'm out.
[65:01.21]Okay, it hurts but I can't just I want to beat it so bad.
[65:18.61]I'm going back to that later What's this one?
[65:29.28]Let's try this one.
[65:39.18]Okay, this one is 130.
[65:40.06]No, 130.
[65:40.40]VG2.
[65:40.50]M9G.
[65:40.68]The dev is proud of you?
[66:00.72]Well, you'll be even more proud of me when I beat it.
[66:04.36]This is called Bowser's Challenge.
[66:07.26]I'm the first one to play this one.
[66:09.95]And it says, kinda hard.
[66:13.03]Alright.
[66:14.71]I'll be the judge of that.
[66:16.47]I am the guy that got a fourth of the way through, um... I don't even remember the name of the level because it was still long ago.
[66:26.58]Homing missiles?
[66:36.90]Oops.
[66:38.46]I'm so used to the car.
[66:41.34]I've only done car.
[66:44.85]I haven't done anything else but car.
[66:48.23]What does that flame mean?
[66:49.63]Oh.
[66:55.18]Nah, I'm fine with cake, Luigi.
[66:59.92]Oh, shit.
[67:11.01]Alright, so I have to... Another hour.
[67:18.52]No, this one just says kinda hard.
[67:20.92]I see the fire now.
[67:23.80]I gotta blow this off.
[67:24.66]I can't kill him.
[67:26.00]So we gotta blow this up.
[67:26.92]Holy shit.
[67:29.94]Okay, this is... I'll get there.
[67:35.55]Okay.
[67:45.65]Okay, hold on, slow down, slow down.
[67:49.39]Holy sh- I had it.
[67:55.66]I've had too much coffee today!
[67:58.24]How do you get reverse coffee?
[68:02.92]Alright, watch it.
[68:10.77]Kinda hard, this could be fire.
[68:14.17]I don't know what's up here.
[68:15.75]Yep, I told you.
[68:16.59]What else we got?
[68:24.20]Alright.
[68:24.98]We got... They go back and forth.
[68:27.28]There is a flame there.
[68:29.56]I'm gonna go now.
[68:31.49]And then... Oh, shit.
[68:35.49]Go now?
[68:36.47]Go now?
[68:37.17]Now?
[68:37.99]And then... What's... Wait!
[68:38.85]Wait!
[68:41.23]Up and over.
[68:42.71]Follow the cubes.
[68:44.05]Holy fuck!
[68:45.25]Where do I go now?
[68:46.13]Oh my god!
[68:50.70]Come on, man!
[68:58.50]Come on!
[69:02.46]Give me another one.
[69:07.60]Alright, that's not- that actually sucks.
[69:11.08]That's gonna be annoying.
[69:11.98]Because I just... got lucky.
[69:17.97]Wait.
[69:22.29]Alright, now I gotta go... Easy.
[69:28.69]Jump over the first one, wait till the flame comes up, and then go across.
[69:32.21]Nooooo!
[69:38.75]God damn it.
[69:43.18]Alright, let me try this again.
[69:56.27]I have plenty of time.
[69:59.73]Depending on how long it is.
[70:08.16]How often does it come up?
[70:11.18]Dang.
[70:13.00]It's gonna do it again here.
[70:14.02]So, like, right now.
[70:15.62]And then I got hit.
[70:16.52]Okay, that's the one I got hit by.
[70:17.82]Alright, same deal.
[70:22.48]He's gonna shoot it out.
[70:24.05]Why did he not shoot it out?
[70:25.37]Why did it take an extra second to... That was, like, timed exactly from when I was gonna land and jump again.
[70:29.99]Okay.
[70:43.18]Out of my way.
[70:47.32]Let's go.
[70:49.41]I can make that.
[71:01.09]Alright, watch this.
[71:02.19]Here comes the second fire.
[71:03.31]Ready?
[71:04.47]You have to wait one cycle here.
[71:07.77]No.
[71:08.67]Holy shit, what an idiot.
[71:09.78]Okay, I'm fine.
[71:10.70]Alright, now this time.
[71:11.52]Here we go.
[71:12.08]He's gonna hop out now.
[71:13.70]He's gonna stand on it.
[71:20.38]Got it.
[71:20.88]Now what?
[71:27.33]I'm so paranoid.
[71:28.27]Okay, uh...
[71:32.10]homing bombers I see the tail of that fire thing though oh oh my god oh no oh I forgot that if you jump up that you stuck up there
[71:59.94]Do a demon screech?
[72:02.04]No, I'm not gonna do a demon screech.
[72:07.06]What does that even mean, by the way?
[72:17.01]That freaked me out!
[72:17.89]It freaked me out, because I couldn't see where I was jumping.
[72:20.25]It freaked me out, and that's what happened.
[72:23.50]I went too fast.
[72:37.17]Demon screech.
[72:39.72]No.
[72:40.64]When are they gonna add save states to Mario Maker?
[72:51.30]I want them.
[72:57.34]He's kind of lost his mind, folks.
[73:00.76]Alright, wait!

[73:30.19]He's gonna jump!
[73:33.25]He jumps, right?
[73:35.63]He jumps?
[73:36.07]Does he jump again?
[73:36.61]I did it!
[74:03.34]That was tricky.
[74:04.84]Ugh.
[74:05.94]I'm so- I'm so shaky.
[74:10.15]Somebody did it in 44 seconds.
[74:11.51]Sorry, it's alright.
[74:18.52]4% completion rate!
[74:19.10]There's like 50 people did this.
[74:23.24]Bongoman's the only other person that did it.
[74:32.73]Alright, let's try this one.
[74:35.39]Brodian weapon.
[74:36.11]Put one in here.
[74:36.69]Let's give it a try.
[74:40.23]Comments.

[74:52.38]Back it up!
[74:52.74]Back it up!
[74:53.02]I don't want to do that!
[74:53.78]How do I back up?
[74:55.34]How do I hit B?
[74:56.16]How do I hit B?
[74:57.44]Do I hit B?
[75:03.26]I can't move to- is it B?
[75:05.38]Which one is- make sure this doesn't happen.
[75:08.16]The big X?
[75:08.82]I can't move!
[75:11.74]I can't hit the X in the top right corner.
[75:14.14]Should I hit- no, is it X?
[75:16.90]Is it B or X?
[75:19.14]Touch the X. I- I'm gonna touch it.
[75:22.34]Okay, I'm gonna- Okay, I got it.
[75:28.93]I got it.
[75:29.23]I got it.
[75:29.79]I ripped the- I ripped the console out.
[75:40.96]Okay, we're good.
[75:45.84]Where?
[75:46.28]I can't see it now.
[75:49.99]Okay.
[75:50.69]I didn't know it was... That would have been such a bad look.
[75:55.47]What a bad look.
[76:04.41]WDGQXT.
[76:10.27]9 PG.
[76:13.99]I was so embarrassed right there.
[76:16.53]I thought that that was like going through.
[76:21.94]Haunted house car ride.
[76:23.18]Okay.
[76:25.52]Okay, here comes another car.
[76:37.03]It's probably gonna be...
[76:40.04]Alright, let's go this way.
[76:44.25]Here we go.
[76:45.17]Haunted house car ride.
[76:46.15]Do I still need the car?
[76:52.27]I think I need the car.
[76:53.91]Oof.
[76:54.05]Yeah, that was an oof moment.
[77:09.29]Alright, Luigi.
[77:09.81]Can I... Yeah, you can just run people over.
[77:14.70]Oof.
[77:20.20]How are you... Oh, that's the scary part.
[77:22.59]I get it.
[77:22.93]Okay.
[77:39.57]Ooh, it's a little trick there.
[77:45.17]They make you jump on it.
[77:46.05]Oh shit.
[77:47.89]Okay.
[77:51.23]It's Luigi's Mansion.
[78:02.49]Luigi's car.
[78:04.91]Oh, that was the joke.
[78:07.03]I actually hit the comedy part, because he spits at you and jumps up and you land on it and it messes you up.
[78:17.06]I didn't even trigger the comedy part last time.
[78:19.32]So shoot it.
[78:19.72]Alright, now we go.
[78:27.40]Oh, wait.
[78:30.07]Um... Okay, I shouldn't be jumping.
[78:39.36]Why do I die, and he... I don't know, but I guess you can't... I thought for some reason I was gonna be able to, uh... It was just a bad car accident.
[78:54.71]Oh, fuck.
[78:55.83]That's just, uh... Alright, here we go.
[79:12.97]They're laughing at me again, because I went... I thought the thing that they were laughing at was the... Go on, spit the thing.
[79:29.71]Shit.
[79:42.90]That was a fucking yeti.
[79:46.22]Somebody found Sasquatch.
[79:48.56]Fucking god dammit.
[79:56.19]Stop laughing at me!
[80:11.89]Do I get double car?
[80:15.33]Alright, I want a new car.
[80:18.43]This car is broken.
[80:23.09]Oh, what?
[80:46.16]What was I supposed to do there?
[80:47.48]I just... You can't tell me you would have done the same damn thing.
[80:53.26]I mean, you would... Look, I'm trying to complain to Chatterhead.
[80:55.50]You would have done the same damn thing!
[81:09.10]Oh, shit.
[81:09.66]Here it comes.
[81:10.08]No, I'm dead.
[81:15.80]I pressed it!
[81:16.50]I was jumping!
[81:18.16]I was pressing B. Why?
[81:19.37]Okay.
[81:41.28]Damn, I fucking like it.
[81:44.94]Ah!
[81:46.32]Mario.
[81:46.90]What?
[81:47.96]No, it's not even Mario.
[81:50.69]It's the shitty green one.
[81:52.05]I forgot.
[81:53.83]Oh, I just made a lot of people angry.
[82:11.46]Do I have to take the car in?
[82:12.88]No.
[82:13.40]Alright, let's do it.
[82:24.83]I did what I was supposed to do.
[82:43.75]Sick.
[82:44.31]3 minutes 44 seconds!
[82:45.55]13%.
[82:50.49]That's still pretty good.
[82:52.37]Let's see what people have to say.
[82:54.09]I wonder how many comments are going to be about me.
[82:58.50]Hmm.
[82:59.58]He can't reach it.
[83:00.76]That's pretty good, jermaHeart.
[83:02.76]Plus 2.
[83:03.34]Jerma, good.
[83:06.42]That's pretty good.
[83:14.80]That was fun.
[83:15.14]That was a good one.
[83:18.12]Let's try... This is the first one I just saw.
[83:19.70]Let's do this one.
[83:29.33]This one is one of the first ones I saw.
[83:31.15]Let's do C, D, D. K, H, W. I do like that a lot of you guys are playing along with it.
[83:38.45]That's fun.
[83:45.85]This is called MonkaS in 3D.
[83:50.15]Is there already a comment?
[83:52.47]Good luck.
[83:53.31]Oh, alright.
[83:56.73]I'll give it a try.
[83:57.31]Let's see.
[84:01.78]This is in 3D.
[84:04.40]That's right.
[84:05.30]Speedrun.
[84:14.99]What did I do?
[84:44.15]Alright, so you get a ball jump.
[84:54.94]Go get Bigfoot.
[84:55.88]No, Bigfoot's not coming out again.
[84:58.32]Alright, power block.
[85:01.94]What do I... Oh, he's just in the way.
[85:09.57]Um...
[85:13.05]I had to jump over this, and then... Oh, the spike's coming down.
[85:21.56]I get it.
[85:21.90]Oh god!
[85:22.64]Speaking of... Spikes.
[85:23.70]Coming down.
[85:24.58]Quickly!
[85:45.90]Go!
[85:50.74]Give it a pee.
[85:55.10]What the fuck?
[85:58.14]Oh, um... How do you get through that?
[86:01.91]Do you have to let him push you to the other side?
[86:18.38]Let's see.
[86:20.82]Aww, really?
[86:24.65]Aww, that's unfortunate.
[86:27.39]Just don't die.
[86:45.22]Oops.
[86:46.04]Alright, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[86:47.26]How do I... Ah, shit.
[86:51.61]Oh my god.
[86:52.21]Okay, you have to jump and then grab the side and then jump up to the hole and... You gotta do that fast.
[87:12.71]The insanity music is playing, yep.
[87:14.67]Come on, really?
[87:20.80]I'm so close.
[87:40.31]Got it.
[87:41.83]I missed a coin, it doesn't matter.
[87:43.27]It's not to try to get every coin, it's to try to get to the end level as fast as you can.
[87:48.89]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
[87:51.73]Alright, we're good.
[87:53.65]Playing to the side.
[87:55.83]Side!
[88:00.03]Oh my god, just jump up there!
[88:01.19]I would have just lost.
[88:05.23]Oh shit, now what do we do?
[88:06.95]Up?
[88:08.22]Oh no.
[88:09.32]The lava's rising.
[88:10.38]The lava's rising.
[88:12.38]Is it gonna come back up?
[88:17.43]No!
[88:37.44]I thought I was going to go the other way.
[88:42.72]Speedrun ruined, but whatever.
[88:44.14]No, no.
[89:03.24]Mr. Spicy Dude, thanks for the five community subs.
[89:06.17]I can see them and I can still play.
[89:16.49]Thank you, Spicy Dude.
[89:23.66]Okay, uh... I...
[89:39.24]Do I need to jump?
[89:39.84]Oh, I need to jump over.
[89:40.58]Now!
[89:40.68]I have to go now!
[89:58.57]So I was right the first time.
[89:59.61]You gotta go over there as fast as you can.
[90:01.37]Because it dips down and then comes back up.
[90:23.79]Okay.
[90:27.68]I just leaned into the mic to do that.
[90:29.92]That's like, we're getting to a point where we're like, settle down.
[90:33.50]You know what I mean?
[90:33.98]Calm down.
[91:00.68]Got it?
[91:01.00]That's what I wanted.
[91:01.56]Okay, come on.
[91:02.83]Get down there and grab him.
[91:12.86]This is how people turn into fucking animals.
[91:15.46]I'm turning into fucking Teen Wolf.
[91:28.15]This is what it feels like to be an Animorph?
[91:35.30]Why do you always yell into your glass?
[91:36.88]Because it muffles the sound and it doesn't peek and hurt your ears.
[91:40.78]So I scream into the mug, and nobody can hear it.
[91:43.16]What?
[92:04.44]That's just what we call it.
[92:15.25]We call that a complaint.
[92:30.66]in the official review.
[92:31.76]I almost touched that.
[92:34.52]That was really close.
[93:00.21]Get up there.
[93:01.73]Alright.
[93:13.13]I swear to God, I gotta stop.
[93:15.19]I gotta fucking... God, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[93:21.70]Can I just hold onto the edge forever?
[93:24.44]No, you start sliding down, don't you?
[93:42.56]I had it that first time too.
[94:30.13]That shit's fucking insane.
[94:31.95]That's actually insane.
[94:34.43]And then we got this shit.
[94:35.29]I forgot about this.
[94:35.93]Alright, calm down.
[94:37.33]I gotta make it to the other... Here we go.
[94:41.88]Now we jump up.
[94:43.62]And we go over now.
[94:46.16]Quickly, get up.
[94:50.58]Is there another one?
[94:56.06]OH!
[94:56.46]You!
[94:57.10]No, why would you do that to me?
[94:59.26]Why would you do that to somebody?
[95:01.68]It was so... It was there!
[95:03.03]Why would you do that?
[95:10.57]Come on, it's just not fair.
[95:13.13]This is not fair.
[95:22.38]That womp jump is so hard.
[95:25.34]Are you gonna kaizo block me?
[95:38.59]Okay, come... Now, where was it?
[95:39.79]It was up and then... Okay.
[95:45.37]Relax.
[95:46.43]Here it comes.
[95:49.91]Alright, where's the... Where is it?
[95:54.04]It's, like, right up here.
[95:56.53]Trigger it, where is it?
[95:59.01]Where is it, where is it?
[96:00.55]There it is.
[96:02.15]Oh my god, you did it again!
[96:06.47]What, I can't go in there?
[96:07.97]Can I go up?
[96:11.18]What's that even there for?
[96:12.12]Hey, hey!
[96:15.94]What?
[96:17.40]Should I?
[96:22.50]Do I need the momentum to do this?
[96:27.05]Oh man, oh man.
[96:42.60]I just freaked out and walked in that thing.
[96:50.12]Would off the spring, would a long jump go across that whole thing?
[96:52.74]I feel like I would just hit the ceiling.
[97:13.96]Oh, come on.
[97:20.43]I'm so close.
[97:21.95]I can't just give up now.
[97:23.60]I'm so close to these.
[97:45.63]What are you doing, Jeremy?
[98:00.38]What are you doing?
[98:03.56]Alright, Kaizo blocks are up here.
[98:08.37]Go up one more.
[98:17.63]I can't handle this shit.
[98:20.75]Come on.
[98:22.01]I was trying.
[98:22.79]I was pressing it as lightly as I could.
[99:03.99]I gotta go up the right side.
[99:05.39]So follow all the way and go up the right side.
[99:13.77]Okay.
[99:15.39]Why couldn't I go up there?
[99:16.67]Why couldn't I go up?
[99:17.41]I was trying to... Oh my god.
[99:23.28]You have to jump early.
[99:24.16]You have to go to the right side early.
[99:35.26]What is happening?
[99:48.55]The Yeti game was good?
[99:49.57]What's a Yeti game?
[100:20.75]I'm the only person that's ever died on this map.
[100:23.96]Alright, well, how about this?
[100:27.58]I 100% guarantee, this is a 100% guarantee, that when I get to the end of this, there's going to be less than 5% of people who completed it.
[100:35.09]I 100% guarantee.
[100:37.63]So you want to talk shit?
[100:40.10]I'm bringing out the fucking Yeti!
[101:03.93]I can't even do this part now.
[101:05.31]Ugh.
[101:59.21]He's gonna go full Yeti.
[102:00.35]He is.
[102:05.79]I stopped that as hard as I could.
[102:12.66]Oh my god, stop it.
[102:40.99]IT HAPPENED AGAIN I WAS TRYING TO STAND ON THE FRONT AND I FUCKING CAN'T I CAN'T I WAS TRYING TO STAND ON THE FRONT YOU HAVE TO KEEP MOVING WITH IT I'M TRYING TO STAND ON THE FRONT BUT IT MOVES FASTER THAN YOU CAN RUN
[103:17.30]I didn't... It just pressed it.
[103:33.21]What is the actual completion rate on this?
[103:35.72]What is it right now?
[103:36.96]I wanna know.
[103:44.98]Get the fuck out of here.
[103:46.56]Get the fuck out of here.
[104:06.27]What am I doing?
[104:07.15]I'm trying to... I'm like overthinking.
[104:09.92]I'm listening to chat.
[104:10.78]Crouch, crouch, crouch.
[104:11.92]No, no, no, no, no.
[104:12.68]I'm just doing it.
[104:34.17]Progress towards the Yeti.
[104:35.11]The Yeti's gonna unleash in a minute here.
[104:37.73]The Yeti's coming out.
[104:45.78]It's currently 0%.
[104:50.59]I'm bringing out the Yeti.
[104:52.37]What happened there?
[104:54.23]What was going on there?
[105:05.11]Oh, I can feel him.
[105:06.35]I can feel him as he's rowing.
[105:09.93]He's in here.
[105:11.61]He's trying to get out.
[105:12.59]He's like, I'm gonna get out there, you know.
[105:15.84]There's a couple more times you die in a row, and then, you know, you look over a chat, and they call you like a fucking idiot.
[105:20.50]You'll be, I'll be out just soon enough.
[105:22.94]Don't worry about me.
[105:24.09]I'll be out soon enough.
[105:25.49]And I'm like, no, you won't.
[105:26.33]Oh, yes, I will.
[105:40.60]Don't fuck it up Okay, alright here we go let's go let's go we're in we're in
[106:08.39]I told you I'd be out soon enough.
[106:12.34]He's no longer with us.
[106:14.40]It's just me.
[106:37.88]What the heck?
[106:42.04]I swear to God, I jumped there.
[106:44.44]It was so obvious that I jumped.
[106:47.92]This is... Alright.
[106:51.70]Well, I would call that bullshit from my neck of the woods.
[106:59.09]Alright, that looks better.
[107:00.71]Alright, I'm down in there.
[107:01.59]Alright, it's a jump.
[107:05.19]Here we go.
[107:05.67]Right here.
[107:09.78]Josh, where did you get to be?
[107:16.82]What happened?
[107:19.04]I'm playing still, I'm good?
[107:22.44]What happened?
[107:23.24]You couldn't fucking do it either?
[107:24.21]Oh, you couldn't do it either, could you?
[107:31.15]He's nowhere to be found.
[107:31.85]I'm not gonna fucking say anything, huh?
[107:33.55]Okay.
[107:50.97]How do I make the jump with the spring?
[107:53.71]I don't get it!
[107:54.51]Do I just not press any buttons at all?
[107:59.27]Oh!
[108:00.87]Listen to my voice!
[108:03.94]This is how people lose their fucking minds!
[108:15.14]This is how people go crazy!
[108:28.85]But how do I have to... I don't understand.
[108:31.99]Do ZR?
[108:35.32]Like the Byahu?
[108:36.32]Do Byahu?
[108:37.76]How do you do Byahu?
[108:39.70]I tried to do it twice.
[108:49.57]I tried to do it twice.
[108:50.77]I tried.
[109:04.79]These games these games this is why why I don't play them because I'm gonna have to go to like the doctor after this I'm gonna have to go to the doctor to get prescribed like Tylenol PM so I could sleep
[109:31.02]I'm gonna wake up in the middle of the night screaming about the Yeti that's coming to get me.
[109:35.78]I'm gonna have a fucking nightmare.
[109:45.32]Oh, what?
[109:51.29]Prescription for Tylenol.
[109:56.38]Do you like this?
[109:58.54]Is this what you want?
[110:00.19]Is this what you wanted?
[110:04.55]No, I'm not going to give it to you.
[110:05.43]I'm not going to give it to you.
[110:09.57]I'm slowing down now.
[110:10.17]I'm going to get it done.
[110:25.47]I know that that's a joke.
[110:26.99]It's like, can you please stop dying as a joke?
[110:29.93]I know you're not serious, but for some reason, for some reason it's infuriating me.
[110:45.26]It's making me so mad.
[110:48.51]And I know it's bullshit.
[110:49.90]I know it's not even real.
[110:51.44]But it's like when you go to the movies, and you watch the bad guy do something bad, and you're like, God, that's bad.
[110:55.62]That bad guy, he's a mean person.
[110:57.89]You know that person's not real, but it still makes you feel bad.
[111:20.60]Like, in the movie... I don't know, I'm trying to think of a move, and I don't want to get very spoiler-less.
[111:24.62]No, jump!
[111:25.00]I gotta jump!
[111:25.88]Fuck, stop!
[111:27.02]Fuck, stop it!
[111:45.48]Who had Jerma loses on an easy level on the ban- It's not an easy level.
[111:49.04]It's not an easy level.
[111:50.60]No, it's not.
[111:51.20]No, it's not.
[111:51.84]It's not.
[111:52.62]I can prove that.
[111:53.28]Okay.
[112:00.71]I'm just gonna do the Byahu Byahu twice in a row, quickly.
[112:06.09]I'm just gonna get up there first.
[112:15.60]This is the part that sucks the most for me, is just trying to stay on that first block.
[112:20.99]What happened?
[112:25.68]You're actually watching somebody live on Twitch lose their mind.
[112:45.24]I'm gonna get to the end of this, and I'm gonna be one of, like, seven people to beat this level.
[112:50.02]And I will be able to say that I did it.
[112:52.37]No more half-skips.
[112:55.31]I'm gonna beat this!
[112:57.13]There's hair going down my- I gotta cut my hair.
[113:08.54]My hair's too long for it to play Mario Maker.
[113:10.64]Your hair gets in your face.
[113:11.30]Alright, shh!
[113:35.73]Oh, okay.
[113:36.47]Two, two, uh, yahoos.
[113:50.64]Okay, what do I do?
[113:51.92]Should I go?
[113:52.44]I have 86 seconds, but what does this take me?
[113:58.15]What the hell?
[113:58.95]He's coming at me!
[114:09.90]I can't fucking do it, man.
[114:12.09]It's not fair.
[114:13.29]It's not fair.
[114:15.51]It's not fair.
[114:16.35]He's coming at me.
[114:26.95]Am I getting charged by a bull?
[114:29.27]Or am I playing a Super Mario game?
[114:38.89]Am I ducking behind like a chair to get away from the bull?
[114:42.78]Here he comes!
[115:02.50]I can't.
[115:05.86]I can't.
[115:06.52]I'm sorry.
[115:07.36]I'm sorry.
[115:11.19]I'm sorry.
[115:11.89]I'm sorry.
[115:14.41]I'm hitting.
[115:15.87]I'm getting hit.
[115:17.37]I gotta get it together.
[115:19.01]That stupid fire guy that just didn't let me begin.
[115:27.60]I'm not gonna play another video game again.
[115:29.94]They're all gonna be this level.
[115:39.88]It's breaking.
[115:45.37]I did the jump so good too, and then I got LOL-momented.
[116:08.68]Okay.
[116:15.00]Excuse me?
[116:15.84]What happened to the game?
[116:17.02]Because that was very... What happened?
[116:19.08]Why would it not stick?
[116:20.58]Sometimes it just doesn't feel like sticking.
[116:23.16]I'm going to start drinking.
[116:27.01]I'm going to start drinking.
[116:27.99]I'm going to just grab a bottle of wine and we're going to win.
[116:30.79]I'm going to drink.
[116:31.45]Let's drink.
[116:32.83]I'm going to start drinking wine.
[117:00.25]I gotta stop, something's going on.
[117:03.97]It needs to be recalibrated or something, I don't understand.
[117:19.94]Take a shot every time you die.
[117:21.26]How about I take a small sip?
[117:27.46]And I mean, like, a tiny one.
[117:29.82]Something's wrong.
[117:32.96]Something's actually wrong here.
[117:34.10]I'm losing it.
[117:38.10]Something's wrong.
[117:39.72]No, something's wrong.
[117:41.36]Something's wrong.
[117:42.68]Here we go.
[117:43.02]Something's wrong.
[117:55.31]Waited too long.
[118:09.03]How the fuck can people do this?
[118:14.38]How the fuck can you do this to yourself?
[118:38.30]I can't fucking even get by this anymore because I keep hitting my head on the ceiling.
[118:43.83]That jump sucks.
[119:41.22]We only got to beat it once.
[119:42.20]That's true.
[119:42.82]That is true.
[119:47.82]There's hair in my mouth.
[120:13.57]Okay, alright, just biyahu, biyahu, biyahu, biyahu.
[120:16.78]Not a big deal, just biyahu.
[120:26.92]Okay, go!
[120:28.46]Just hold right.
[120:30.46]Go!
[120:33.95]Holy shit!
[120:37.05]But I don't know what to do about this!
[120:38.99]Woah!
[121:03.91]I'm not an anime fighter.
[121:06.21]I just powered up and yelled my move.
[121:10.91]But how are you gonna deal with THIS?! !
[121:28.35]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[121:31.34]Every time I make progress, there's another thing I have to learn and then die because the spring is gonna launch me forward.
[121:42.78]This is new things to memorize every time.
[122:10.02]I gotta be close to the end, though.
[122:12.17]If I do this, I get there again, then I just jump, wall jump a few times.
[122:16.59]It's gotta be, like, the end, right?
[122:17.55]It has to be.
[122:20.59]You're almost at, like, the Mario Maker limit for amount of assets.
[122:24.34]Right?
[122:26.60]It has to be.
[122:42.17]Alright, let's try it again.
[122:52.18]Thank you!
[122:58.46]Okay.
[123:00.32]Wall jump.
[123:06.34]This momentum was so much faster.
[123:07.96]There was so much more momentum off the spring.
[123:09.56]Oh my god.
[123:22.75]Yeah, I probably shouldn't even use the sprint.
[123:24.63]Can I just like... I don't know.
[123:56.94]I'm 80% done if I get to the wall part?
[124:00.72]Oh shit, there's more!
[124:03.13]There's 20% more?!
[124:22.48]I gotta knock it out of the park, but I gotta get that jump correct.
[124:31.64]Off the spring, and then off of the wall, and then jump over the wall?
[124:35.50]Okay, let's go.
[124:59.53]Okay, come on.
[125:01.45]Just right off, don't jump that high.
[125:03.76]Just jump a little.
[125:05.72]Small jump.
[125:09.02]Just a little one.
[125:10.14]Hey, hey!
[125:13.11]God damn it!
[125:14.51]I can go up around to the left.
[125:16.27]There's not enough momentum.
[125:22.49]I'll jump right into the...
[125:26.31]I'm gonna try to go around the left side.
[125:27.81]That looks like a hay.
[125:28.77]Try this way, maybe.
[125:29.87]Oh.
[125:54.98]I just wanted to eat, like, mild hot dog.
[125:58.94]But... This is not... This is eating... This is like the... Can't you eat 50 hot wings challenge.
[126:06.15]After... I went in here with, like, my kids.
[126:08.83]I just... I just... Hold on.
[126:10.11]Shh!
[126:11.69]I fucked it up.
[126:12.19]No, I didn't.
[126:12.51]Thank God I'm smart.
[126:17.58]I just wanted to come in here with my children and get... Okay, I...
[126:46.93]No, yet he's gone.
[126:49.61]No mo- There's a man playing Mario Maker to Switch in my driveway, and he- I'm not in your driveway, I'm in MY house!
[127:10.17]Take the clear pipe during the snake block?
[127:12.31]I can't.
[127:15.27]It doesn't hug the wall.
[127:22.72]I was thinking about trying it.
[127:34.08]It doesn't have to hug the wall?
[127:50.71]What do you mean?
[127:51.05]Like, it has to hug this wall, right?
[127:52.32]Yeah, see?
[127:56.58]I can't grab it.
[127:59.96]I just ran into that shit.
[128:13.47]Alright.
[128:17.05]I'm gonna try going to the left side.
[128:21.91]No, I'm not.
[128:24.17]You just instantly get bounced and you're just dead if you don't go forward.
[128:27.35]You just die.
[128:29.60]If you do not go forward, you are guaranteed to die.
[128:32.38]You have to go forward.
[128:33.56]You can't just go left.
[128:46.85]My stamina is starting to be depleted.
[128:51.31]I don't even smoke cigarettes.
[128:53.17]But I might.
[128:53.71]My stamina's at risk.
[129:31.83]No, what the fuck just happened?
[129:33.51]I... I gotta move on.
[129:39.43]I don't think I can take this anymore.
[129:41.29]I don't think I can take this anymore.
[129:44.39]I don't think I can fucking take this shit anymore.
[129:53.21]It's like so fucking hard.
[129:55.39]It's too much.
[130:08.27]You're so close.
[130:11.03]If it doesn't matter how close you are, you could drive your car 100 miles and have 90 miles worth of gas.
[130:21.01]The car's breaking down.
[130:22.09]We're gonna start putting the damn thing in neutral and start pushing me.
[131:05.27]Alright, I'm just gonna try the wall jump.
[131:07.54]I'm gonna just try.
[131:08.58]Here we go.
[131:09.16]Here we go!
[131:09.58]Holy fuck!
[131:15.38]Now what?
[131:27.87]Where do I go from here?
[131:35.40]Where do I go from here?
[131:37.02]Huh?
[131:37.16]What do you want me to do now?
[131:41.84]But what?
[131:42.04]What do you want me to do now?
[131:54.33]I don't understand!
[131:55.17]Oh, wait, I understand!
[131:59.49]I understand!
[132:05.43]Did I make it?
[132:07.77]Did I make it?
[132:11.29]Do I drive the car over this way?
[132:13.03]Did I make it?
[132:46.07]That was... That was Goofy falling off a cliff.
[133:12.01]That's Goofy falling off the cliff, but he's covered in fire ants.
[133:19.52]Oh, come on.
[133:24.62]I had it.
[133:26.20]I can do it.
[133:26.96]I know what to do now.
[133:31.43]Dude, that was probably the most embarrassing noise I've ever made on camera.
[133:37.48]I really think so.
[133:39.10]It could be.
[133:39.68]That was really fucking embarrassingly loud and weird and fucking strange.
[133:46.72]I'm not proud of that.
[133:47.80]At all.
[133:48.88]Not at all.
[133:50.08]There's nothing about that is what I'm proud of.
[133:56.92]And I get to go around again.
[133:58.20]And it goes faster the second time.
[134:01.43]Okay.
[134:03.85]Alright.
[134:11.18]Oh my god.
[134:13.70]I did that.
[134:14.24]I beat this part on all adrenaline after this.
[134:17.33]And now... And now I have to do it again.
[134:19.85]Oh, I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to... No, I'm not!
[134:41.88]I'm so defeated.
[134:47.11]I can do it.
[134:47.77]I know I can.
[134:48.73]Fuck.
[134:49.65]But I'm sorry.
[134:50.89]I'm sorry this has taken so long.
[134:52.51]And I'm sorry that you... Not my proudest moment.
[134:58.75]Okay.
[134:59.61]Calm down.
[135:00.11]I can do it.
[135:00.91]It's not that bad.
[135:01.71]It's just precision and patience and...
[135:12.40]I can't believe it.
[135:13.74]I thought I was going to be able to move on finally, but we're still here.
[135:18.99]That was the one.
[135:19.89]I can't believe I... But what do you do there?
[135:24.97]I hit my head?
[135:26.05]Do I have to jump?
[135:27.60]I have to jump out of the car.
[135:31.92]I think that's... You hit the top and then you jump out of the car.
[135:36.14]That makes sense to me.
[135:38.14]I don't know.
[135:38.58]I'm going to try.
[135:59.29]Alright.
[136:01.67]Try it again.
[136:13.78]This part's the one that just fucks with me.
[136:16.40]It's just, don't jump.
[136:17.40]You just kind of go through it, but then you have to panic.
[136:23.92]Let's see what happens.
[136:25.66]I tried.
[136:26.02]I tried.
[136:26.46]It didn't jump.
[136:27.44]It didn't jump.
[136:28.68]It didn't go forward fast enough.
[136:30.52]Oh my god.
[136:31.60]Guys.
[136:35.92]Guys.
[136:38.92]Just a little jump.
[136:40.16]It's just a little one.
[136:42.32]I think I've died two or three hundred times on this level.
[136:48.42]Anyone have any idea?
[136:50.92]How many times have I died here?
[136:52.04]It's gotta be at least two or three hundred times.
[137:18.79]I've been here for at least 50 minutes, at least.
[137:22.33]But this one feels way more painful than the other car one.
[137:26.02]I don't know why.
[137:28.40]This one just is pain.
[137:31.68]The other one was not pain.
[137:53.01]Oh yeah, that one was Needles.
[138:01.82]Super Mario Man.
[138:03.40]Little jump.
[138:05.54]Little jump.
[138:10.30]Little, little jump.
[138:11.02]Little jump.
[138:11.96]I didn't f-
[138:23.10]I didn't do the little twirl.
[138:33.07]I could guarantee after this we'd go... I'm doing it.
[138:35.23]I'm going... Not even mild.
[138:37.57]I'm just gonna eat ice cream on camera.
[138:41.63]I'm just gonna eat ice cream on camera.
[138:53.09]And I'm going to do the easiest levels in the game.
[138:55.83]I'm going to use one hand.
[139:05.18]He fucking beat it.
[139:09.24]It's coming back.
[139:10.38]I'm getting a flashback of that moment.
[139:33.90]Okay.
[139:37.42]Two people have beaten this level?
[139:39.02]Oh, Jesus.
[139:46.85]No!
[139:50.41]I even... I just wasn't high enough, apparently.
[140:01.13]Oh, I'm gonna do it.
[140:06.68]I'm gonna do it.
[140:09.08]It'll be alright.
[140:09.86]Everything's gonna be fine.
[140:10.88]I just need to... I need to relax and just get it done.
[140:20.14]It's not okay.
[140:20.64]I'm gonna get killed.
[140:21.70]I don't think I was going fast enough.
[140:24.46]Oh, I was.
[140:29.86]Somebody just said the word jello.
[140:31.93]Don't do that right now.
[140:35.59]I'm so sorry for what I've done to your psyche.
[140:39.19]Well, it's definitely good.
[140:42.35]Otherwise, I would have stopped playing it.
[140:48.20]Oh shit, I forgot!
[140:48.82]I'm gonna freak out.
[140:58.60]When you do something enough times in a row, and then you start to just... just wash over you.
[141:04.54]It just washes over you.
[141:06.80]Like for instance, I tried to wall jump, but Super Mario Maker 2 sucks.
[141:11.20]So you can't grab on sometimes.
[141:31.46]Fuck.
[141:36.37]I swear to god.
[141:43.79]I'm gonna be the third person to beat this level.
[141:45.97]I will.
[141:58.51]Can I get, like, webcams of the other two people to beat this?
[142:02.23]I wanna see your reaction.
[142:04.90]Alright, just do it.
[142:38.93]Is there everyone that was telling me to jump in this pipe over here?
[142:40.77]Or were you telling me to do that?
[142:49.86]Alright, I need to get a good grab onto the wall here.
[142:55.70]Because I've done this twice now and I've gotten there and I've just hit that right at the edge.
[143:08.52]No, no, it wasn't enough.
[143:09.58]I knew it.
[143:10.04]I knew it wasn't enough when I went up to the... I knew it wasn't enough.
[143:13.22]I knew it wasn't enough, and that's why I did it.
[143:14.74]I knew it wasn't enough.
[143:15.44]I just... It was wrong, and I knew it, and I had to just accept it.
[143:20.93]It's not hesitation.
[143:21.99]I just wasn't high enough.
[143:45.66]I need to completely just like capitulate on this level and then I'll beat it.
[144:11.32]I don't care about time.
[144:13.24]No, just step on it, please.
[144:17.06]Does the audio desync?
[144:25.09]I'll fix it later.
[144:25.87]I'll fix it when I go take my first break, which will be in another three to four hundred attempts at this level.
[144:42.40]No, no, no.
[144:42.80]That's gonna happen sooner.
[144:43.68]I just need to get it over with.
[144:45.34]I need to get it over with.
[144:54.10]It's all just math.
[144:56.16]It's all just math and assets.
[144:58.29]None of this is real.
[144:59.99]There's no spikes.
[145:00.71]There's no fire.
[145:01.91]None of this shit's real.
[145:02.87]It's all math.
[145:04.17]You just have to do it at the right second.
[145:05.53]It's just mathematics.
[145:06.37]I'm gonna do this one mathematically and see if it works.
[145:12.77]There's no coins on the screen.
[145:13.97]There's no fire.
[145:14.57]There's no Mario.
[145:15.34]There's no Luigi.
[145:16.20]It's just math.
[145:29.79]It's just math!
[145:50.95]Come on.
[146:01.96]Alright, here we go.
[146:02.62]Two divided by four is two.
[146:05.34]Three divided by five is six.
[146:07.58]Let's go!
[146:10.90]Yes!
[146:17.01]Am I dead?
[146:55.13]Yeti bit.
[146:56.67]Hey Dermot, good stream.
[146:57.89]PS, beat desert bust.
[146:59.15]I don't think I can.
[147:00.89]My god, this level sucks.
[147:02.57]56 minutes ago?
[147:08.93]33, by the way.
[147:20.37]Thanks for the five community subs rare Pepe body lotion.
[147:24.11]I know this is cheating, but I made this just for you.
[147:30.31]It's cheating.
[147:33.75]You knew I was going to come scroll down these.
[147:38.05]That was a good level.
[147:39.11]I'm probably 38 now.
[147:41.11]Alright, no, you got me.
[147:46.08]You got me.
[147:46.44]That's a good strategy.
[147:48.00]You got me.
[147:50.82]TFP... C7... This is cheating.
[148:01.57]C7H.
[148:01.71]Okay, now I have... I'm back.
[148:08.33]I'm back in action.
[148:11.72]I'm very fragile, as you guys know.
[148:23.77]Let's do it.
[148:25.15]Okay.
[148:26.77]This is 38.
[148:27.99]I feel so happy I don't have to do that anymore.
[148:33.06]TFP.
[148:34.80]I can feel how red my body is.
[148:37.80]C7H.
[148:38.14]It's a 1, not a 7.
[148:44.76]Oh.
[148:54.14]Oh, the audio desync.
[148:55.08]Okay.
[148:56.30]World 6-3, they're the rats.
[149:00.92]So the game audio is happening early?
[149:03.27]Is that what somebody said?
[149:03.99]Let's see if that helps.
[149:14.08]You tell me.
[149:14.42]Ready?
[149:17.34]Should be...
[149:26.27]World 6-3, they're the rats.
[149:33.03]Alright.
[149:33.57]Oh, they sing?
[149:34.25]Anything hidden in here?
[149:35.70]Oh, this is a delicious, mild fucking level.
[149:58.38]QRS housing.
[150:00.69]How do I get that?
[150:03.31]Gotta go up?
[150:03.87]Don't kill them.
[150:05.63]I'm not killing them, I'm defeating them.
[150:32.10]Thanks.
[150:42.17]Ooh, ten coins.
[150:49.47]But yeah, so, don't you know, in every game that's not rated at least T, these people are being defeated.
[150:57.73]They're not being killed.
[150:58.59]There's a difference.
[151:01.13]What's in the door?
[151:10.93]Good thing I just touched that flag.
[151:15.83]Defeating them kills them.
[151:16.86]No, it doesn't.
[151:17.86]It just crushes their head.
[151:28.14]I love the... I told you, my stamina was deflated.
[151:32.41]My body... My soul left my body.
[151:34.97]Like, for the last 45 minutes.
[151:37.11]I'm not used to slowing down.
[151:43.72]That wasn't on the head.
[151:58.17]I told you, there's only one level I know how to play.
[152:04.94]Oh, it's because he has spikes on his back.
[152:06.98]I get it.
[152:07.40]That's not clear.
[152:09.72]That's not clear.
[152:10.76]By the...
[152:15.05]I didn't realize they were spikes.
[152:16.15]I thought they were just a hairstyle.
[152:33.04]Oh my god!
[152:33.84]That's kind of tricky, actually.
[152:41.14]The conveyor belts are hard to be on.
[152:43.87]I know, you're right.
[152:50.13]It's just a math problem.
[152:50.91]You're right.
[152:52.35]What am I thinking?
[152:53.76]It's just math.
[152:55.68]I jumped too high.
[152:56.60]It's fucking me.
[152:58.32]It's fucking me.
[152:59.24]It goes back and forth.
[153:00.76]I'm not using it.
[153:01.82]I'm not doing math.
[153:11.91]Why is Luigi jump like 5,000 feet in the air?
[153:21.98]Damn!
[153:22.50]This part is actually very hard.
[153:25.06]You only have one real spot you can jump and the conveyor belts really fuck with you.
[153:29.08]I'm just going across.
[153:36.06]Like that.
[153:44.95]Damn!
[153:45.55]That got so fast!
[153:53.47]Alright.
[153:55.69]I'm gonna have to clear him out.
[153:56.83]I'm gonna clear out the first one, and then go back.
[153:58.53]Because that aggro's him.
[154:01.68]And then I'm gonna have him jump, kill you, and now I can just jump.
[154:06.56]Nope.
[154:07.78]Never mind.
[154:14.61]Although I'm kind of screwed here.
[154:18.51]Spikes.
[154:23.94]Oh shit!
[154:25.64]Oh my god!
[154:27.36]Too fast!
[154:28.76]Too...
[154:41.58]Do I have to jump over that?
[154:45.19]Jesus.
[154:49.65]It's so fast!
[154:51.25]And then this one goes the other way!
[155:13.44]And I can't kill those things?
[155:14.60]Shit.
[155:15.50]Oh, I almost had it.
[155:43.68]I'm gonna stay here for a second.
[155:44.64]Wait.
[155:48.00]Alright, finally.
[155:50.71]I made it with a big guy.
[155:52.57]That hasn't happened yet.
[155:56.99]Oh, shit.
[156:20.42]No!
[156:21.26]No!
[156:21.38]I'm gonna have to go back through this all again, aren't I?
[156:30.38]Fucking compare buffs.
[156:32.37]I hate these things!
[156:50.01]Uh-huh.
[157:22.09]Why?
[157:27.05]Why?
[157:30.83]This is just fucking... It's going too fast.
[157:34.75]It's going too fast.
[157:39.65]You can't even land on the ground here.
[158:02.91]Do I just have to... I'm gonna try to just jump over the spikes.
[158:06.03]No, I'm... Don't get hit by the second rat again.
[158:22.02]The conveyor goes the other way!
[158:24.81]It's hard!
[158:28.19]You lose... There's so much momentum change when you jump from these things.
[158:35.06]Alright, let me see if I can do this.
[158:44.03]No.
[158:46.25]What the fuck just happened?
[159:07.99]Alright.
[159:09.41]No, fuck, no.
[159:11.13]I can't even turn around.
[159:38.38]What am I doing?
[159:45.70]Jump!
[159:46.30]Jump!
[159:47.72]Oh my god.
[160:00.07]I know, I know the rats jump when I jump.
[160:02.27]I knew that when I first walked in the door!
[160:06.57]You don't think I knew that?
[160:08.33]You think it's taken me this long to figure that out?
[160:13.16]I'm turning into the fucking air conditioner from Brave Little Toaster.
[160:17.40]I'm back.
[160:30.97]Hi, guys.
[160:46.13]You can't even go there.
[160:47.27]It just automatically... You see what I'm fucking saying?
[161:19.24]Just run underneath.
[161:21.35]You can't run underneath.
[161:23.29]Did you see what just happened there, son?
[161:25.81]You can't run underneath them.
[161:27.67]Stop telling me to run underneath that one.
[161:30.02]Son, you can't do it.
[161:31.00]I've tried it, son.
[161:32.20]I just want to... Son, come into my office for a minute.
[161:34.82]I want to talk to you.
[161:58.30]I need a break I don't care, I win
[162:29.25]I guess- EIGHT MINUTES!
[162:31.17]Now get out of here, kid!
[162:45.36]Holy shit, how did you draw that?
[162:51.96]Medium heat, salsa, and chips.
[162:53.81]Medium- I gave- Play my level.
[163:08.06]These are so good.
[163:20.01]Stop acting.
[163:20.91]I wasn't gonna report that comment.
[163:27.23]The conveyor belts just fuck with me so bad.
[163:29.71]Alright, let's take one from chat.
[163:36.95]Let's take one from chat.
[163:46.55]P... Hold on.
[163:48.19]There's a fish there.
[163:48.89]That means I have to use it.
[163:49.85]Let's try this one.
[163:59.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[163:59.74]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

[164:18.58]Get the mushroom all the way to the end.
[164:22.20]Okay.
[164:29.42]Reach the goal as Super Mario.
[164:30.89]Alright, sounds good.
[164:34.65]Alright, no more screaming.
[164:38.19]No more yelling.
[164:38.79]No more... I think I already lost.
[164:48.61]Okay, I didn't know that Okay, I got it.

[165:52.21]I had to eat it.
[165:53.25]Come back.
[165:53.53]It'll bounce back.
[166:00.53]And then we have to go across?
[166:02.45]Yup.
[166:05.63]But then, how do I get over there?

[167:21.50]Hit it now while you have a shot.
[167:22.64]You don't have to just- just- jeez.
[167:25.04]It's just my stimulation.
[167:27.86]I'm just stimulated, is what it is.
[167:33.79]What happened there?
[167:34.43]It's the stimulation that's doing it to me, Peter.
[167:50.14]Okay.
[167:51.52]Oh, you fucker.
[167:54.54]You're in a simulation?
[167:58.98]I think I'm in a normal world.
[168:19.45]Why do you keep hitting the coin ones?
[168:21.05]Because there's something wrong with me.
[168:24.81]You understand?

[168:56.67]It's making me so mad.
[169:21.48]Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here!
[169:26.79]Sorry.
[169:31.89]No, you too, I'm too big!
[169:34.33]Why am I, I'm too big to do that!
[169:37.05]Alright, Yoshi can't come through there.
[169:39.51]Yoshi cannot go through there, he's too big.
[169:45.78]So I really should just leave him.
[169:54.30]I thought I needed him for something.
[169:55.58]Oh man.
[169:56.18]He forgot the coins.
[169:58.05]Easy.
[169:58.49]Easy.
[170:37.37]Fuck off, Yoshi.
[170:38.07]Yoshi, get... No.
[170:42.16]Yoshi, why did you... Why?
[170:44.02]Just... Why?
[170:47.01]Get out of the way.
[170:49.23]I'm just dumping him.
[170:50.25]The second I throw, I'm spitting out...
[171:16.86]You did that there, it's there on purpose.
[171:19.87]It's there on, it's on fucking purpose.
[171:25.47]That like you, this, this stupid spike is right there to run into.
[171:33.94]Somebody just texted me.
[171:34.88]What if it was like my mother saying, I'm watching you play Mario Maker and you really need to calm down.
[171:40.26]I don't like this side of you.
[171:44.67]You are such a sweet boy. ...
[172:11.10]Now what?
[172:12.42]Get over there!
[172:13.72]I did it!
[172:15.54]This is not a puzzle anymore, this is a hard level.
[172:38.75]What's he doing?
[172:41.03]I don't like that.
[172:41.77]I don't like this.
[172:42.71]Is he gonna go up?
[172:47.99]Uh-oh.
[172:48.71]Okay, he goes down.
[172:55.07]Wait, hold on.
[172:55.71]But I need to... He goes across this.
[172:59.59]There's another mushroom that I have to take care of.
[173:01.27]I have to have him go... Oh, no.
[173:04.28]Okay.
[173:06.23]Hopefully I can get this, otherwise it's the whole thing again.
[173:08.15]Let's go.
[173:12.11]He made it.
[173:12.51]Oh, shit.
[173:14.16]Now what?
[173:14.50]Oh my god, what do I do?
[173:18.48]Oh my god.
[173:24.22]What?
[173:26.06]What's going on?
[173:26.56]Oh.
[173:26.62]Should I have brought this with me?
[173:29.62]I don't, what the fuck is going on?
[173:33.98]What, wait, wait, how is he...
[173:40.41]There's something there?
[173:41.45]The blue... oh, fuck.
[173:48.15]Oh, this is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[173:59.94]I just tried to run by that.
[174:08.32]Here we go.
[174:09.86]No.
[174:10.44]Oh, shit.
[174:11.74]I got it.
[174:12.52]Alright, so now...
[174:36.58]So what was I missing the first?
[174:38.12]Let me just look.
[174:39.80]So I didn't grab the blue thing to touch or something?
[174:45.88]Okay, here we go.
[174:50.03]Alright, here we go.
[174:54.99]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[174:57.01]Now?
[175:00.70]Is that?
[175:02.10]It worked!
[175:02.80]Wait, do I have to take this with me?
[175:04.02]Do I have to take this with me?
[175:07.14]I don't know what to do!
[175:07.90]It's gonna fall if I don't!
[175:08.86]I... I think it's over.
[175:14.20]It's probably already bounced.
[175:15.44]Yeah, you gotta take this thing.
[175:17.58]You gotta... If it's lying on there, if you use it, it's gonna just drop.
[175:25.47]Oh, fuck.
[175:30.51]Alright, well, now I know what to do.
[175:37.49]See, Mom, I promise him.
[175:39.15]Everything's fine.
[175:40.27]It's not.
[175:45.79]Come on, Yoshi.
[175:46.47]Let's do it.
[175:48.03]You and me.
[175:48.43]Together.
[176:15.81]Bye, Yoshi.
[176:16.47]One, two, three.
[176:27.36]It's a Rube Goldberg machining.
[176:28.72]Yeah, kind of reminds me.
[176:29.62]That's sort of what it looks like, yeah.
[176:42.83]And then we gotta wait till now.
[176:46.47]Grab the pea and let's go.
[176:56.12]I gotta hit it now.
[177:10.03]It was right there, but I thought it was ahead of me.
[177:14.15]I thought I was panicking.
[177:15.45]I thought it was ahead of me.
[177:16.59]Shit.
[177:17.91]Oh well.
[177:21.11]It's right there.
[177:22.11]That was a hair difference.
[177:53.18]This music making you sleepy?
[177:57.46]Wake up!
[178:25.36]Alright.
[178:27.26]Okay.
[178:28.78]I'm ready.
[178:30.56]I've prepared myself for this.
[178:33.99]I just have to wait till it gets across.
[178:38.45]Let's go.
[178:38.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[178:43.07]No.
[178:56.97]I beat him last time, just relax.
[179:07.95]Um... What?
[179:12.97]Oh my god.
[179:15.59]But... How would that do anything?
[179:19.50]Wait a minute.
[179:22.26]Wouldn't that just fall down?
[179:25.77]I'm just gonna walk ahead, but wouldn't that just make it fall?
[179:39.19]I guess it would just go on top and then go forward?
[179:42.33]It wouldn't fall backwards though, would it?
[179:46.21]This is the end of the level, right?
[180:05.75]It can do it, it's just slow.
[180:10.75]Oh, I don't know why.
[180:11.87]I figured it would just fall down.
[180:13.64]Or get stuck down there.
[180:17.06]Oh.
[180:17.80]Oh, Yoshi.
[180:20.38]You are the worst.
[180:34.71]What happened there?
[180:38.61]I've done this part!
[181:06.97]The one time I pixel jump over his body.
[181:14.44]You gotta be shitting me.
[181:19.01]Yoshi, move!
[181:59.59]Really?
[181:59.93]I was gonna say, get out of here.
[182:04.04]Too early, too early, too early, too early!
[182:26.09]Okay, let's get it.
[182:28.65]Ha!
[183:00.57]I'm so happy that I have to do this first part every single time.
[183:15.58]I love it.
[183:16.10]I'm in love with it.
[183:58.22]That's what I call classic pee pants.
[184:00.26]It's a classic pee pants moment coming up.
[184:14.04]No, the fucking ice!
[184:16.58]I just have to carry.
[184:20.47]I just have to, oh my god!
[184:26.64]I just have to bring the button over, but the- when the stupid cannon shoots!
[184:34.58]What the fuck?
[184:51.28]Oh no, I'm so tilted that it's just that this first half of the level I want to just fucking tear it up and put it in a shredder.
[184:56.96]Huh.
[185:25.68]What just happened?
[185:26.34]Holy shit, hold on.
[185:27.58]Someone just gave a trillion subs.
[185:36.42]Cyanide just gave 20 subs.
[185:39.96]Thank you for the 20 community subs, Cyanide.
[185:44.82]That's a lot.
[185:46.44]That's a ton.
[185:47.48]So I'm gonna do this for you now.
[185:49.10]I have to beat this.
[185:49.68]This is it.
[185:53.50]I'm gonna get it right here.
[185:54.78]Trigger the cannon.
[185:56.04]And then... I'm gonna bring the pee pants all the way across.
[186:02.12]Trigger the cannon.
[186:02.73]Pee pants.
[186:03.77]Just run.
[186:06.61]Let's go.
[186:10.35]Put it down and get it!
[186:13.99]Got it?
[186:15.77]Holy shit, it's there!
[186:17.13]How do I get it?
[186:17.53]How do I touch it?
[186:18.66]Oh my god, do I pick the coins up?
[186:20.94]No.
[186:22.36]Alright, I got IP pantsed in.
[186:26.82]What?
[186:29.34]I was gonna say, no way.
[186:38.03]Anything else happen here?
[186:40.41]What's going on here?
[186:40.97]This looks weird.
[186:50.22]That was a good one.
[187:04.11]All it took was 20 community subs.
[187:05.81]That's all it took.
[187:06.59]See?
[187:06.77]I told you.
[187:07.17]That was clever.
[187:10.31]It was clever.
[187:10.89]It was.
[187:27.62]What the hell?
[187:37.94]Some of you guys, I don't know how you guys do this in like 40 minutes.
[187:41.64]Actually, 7 minutes.
[187:45.04]Here's an easy level.
[187:51.16]Djerba bad.
[187:52.24]You didn't find the 10, 30, and 50 coins, but it's fine.
[187:56.06]The fuck?
[187:58.64]It's my turn.
[188:18.45]It's my turn.
[188:20.46]Here's one, here's one.
[188:21.44]Report that comment?
[188:34.80]This is what the feature's for, right?
[188:43.50]That's what the feature's for.
[188:44.60]I mean, come on.
[188:45.90]You can't do shit like that.
[188:56.04]Nintendo's not, that's not alright.
[188:57.42]Nintendo's, that's not, that's against Nintendo policy.
[189:02.09]It's slander.
[189:18.72]This report was sent to Nintendo.
[189:26.85]Hit the button.
[189:27.53]Alright, I'm doing it.
[189:28.47]I'm hitting it.
[189:30.57]It's inappropriate.
[189:33.04]Alright.
[189:34.36]It's inappropriate.
[189:45.56]That's inappropriate.
[189:47.85]Behavior...
[189:58.22]I'm writing this off stream.
[190:12.68]It's too much work.
[190:13.76]No, it's not.
[190:14.63]It's just...
[190:47.11]I just almost turned the camera on.
[190:49.84]Do I have to avoid comments now?
[190:52.04]Let's try this one.
[191:14.72]Oh, did I just lose it?
[191:15.46]Where is it?
[191:15.74]Where is it?
[191:16.02]Where is it?
[191:16.30]Where is it?
[191:16.56]Where is it?
[191:20.00]There it is.
[191:23.09]1WB, P-O-L-G-X-F.
[191:32.61]Oh, P is zero.
[191:33.47]Wait, what was it?
[191:34.35]1WB.
[191:34.55]P-O-L-G-X-F.
[191:48.07]But bombs begin their attack.
[191:49.03]Blast a hole in the command ship.
[191:53.96]I think this is the first Mario 2, Mario 3 level I've seen.
[192:21.96]He's my favorite.
[192:23.00]I always do really well on these ones.
[192:24.64]It's down here.
[192:48.86]Missed coin.
[192:49.42]Missed coin.
[192:49.96]Missed coin.
[192:50.68]I know.
[192:50.98]You guys are saying that.
[192:51.70]I don't care.
[192:53.32]Missed coin.
[192:53.86]Missed coin.
[192:54.38]Missed coin.
[192:54.74]See that jump?
[192:56.46]Oh, fuck.
[193:08.57]What's happening here?
[193:09.63]Oh, it's an explosion!
[193:19.03]I thought I was gonna get the, uh, the star, the thing that, the roulette, the slot machine thing Blow it out
[193:42.41]Load up.
[193:43.51]Nice.
[193:43.77]Who cares about that?
[193:47.98]I don't even need the mushroom.
[193:52.52]Ooh, I got kaizo blocked.
[193:54.98]Kaizo blocked.
[193:56.22]Careful.
[193:57.02]Careful now.
[193:57.54]That'll be it.
[194:12.05]Got it.
[194:16.29]Yeah, I did well on that level.
[194:17.49]That was a second attempt.
[194:19.17]And that's a world record.
[194:21.07]I like that one.
[194:28.64]Alright, be nice here.
[194:30.58]I don't want to have any other bullshit here.
[194:47.58]I'm not gonna abuse the system.
[194:53.14]That was good.
[194:53.74]Good.
[194:54.22]Good level.
[194:56.68]Let's try this one.
[194:58.96]This one has a sad face next to it, because... I got it.
[195:03.22]I got it.
[195:03.58]I'll do this one.
[195:05.43]FPD.
[195:09.77]Play TF2 with star.
[195:22.04]Searching for level.
[195:23.98]This is called... Lengthy level.
[195:25.64]Alright.
[195:49.92]Change his course.
[195:50.59]Am I gonna have to deal with this asshole the whole time?
[195:55.73]You know when you sneak up behind a cat and the cat is really not paying attention at all and you get to right next to the cat's back and the cat just like freaks the fuck out and jumps?
[196:06.79]That's what just happened.
[196:17.20]This thing's made out of ice too.
[196:18.80]Oh boy.
[196:19.29]I'm not ready for this one.
[196:29.58]No, wrong!
[196:32.88]Wrong.
[196:33.82]Wrong.
[196:34.36]Is there one?
[196:34.72]Does it respawn?
[196:44.34]Don't change it.
[196:45.24]I'm just trying to jump on his head.
[197:22.43]Mad because bald.
[197:25.21]Wouldn't you be?
[197:30.22]Almost there.
[197:41.37]If I was.
[197:41.91]What the?
[197:46.41]Get it, get up there.
[197:54.63]Ooh.
[197:57.33]I got it!
[197:57.71]That's it?
[197:59.25]That's all it does for me?
[198:02.35]I guess there's nothing else here for me to do.
[198:04.09]Just 30 coins.
[198:06.85]30 coins.
[198:09.38]I gotta go over that faster.
[198:16.42]Um... I can't just jump on that, can I?
[198:20.46]I'm gonna need a lot of momentum for this.
[198:27.49]Oh, I slipped.
[198:46.45]I get to do momentum jump, momentum jump, momentum jump.
[198:53.49]It makes sense to me.
[199:05.56]Perfect.
[199:06.34]Ugh, the slippery shit.
[199:08.14]Ugh.
[199:15.84]Just stop.
[199:17.70]Please.
[199:18.22]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, no.
[199:29.35]I fucked it up again.
[199:30.27]It's just been so...
[199:35.04]I don't know why I did that I can't believe I didn't get hit by that That was a miracle
[199:54.99]Alright, out of the way, out of the way.
[199:58.61]They disappear already.
[200:01.68]The speed, it was so slow.
[200:03.96]I couldn't turn around fast enough.
[200:07.07]It's all ice.
[200:09.13]It's all ice.
[200:10.03]This is the swamp level of fucking Mario games.
[200:30.24]Oh my god, you can't, you can't.
[200:33.24]Holy shit.
[200:37.71]Do you see how slippery this is?
[200:39.61]It's turned up times 10 slippery.
[200:41.85]This is the most slippery any fucking level I've ever played.
[200:44.79]I can't do it.
[200:45.39]I just slid across the whole entire level.
[200:55.80]It's a times 10 slippery.
[201:03.85]That's like when you go to McDonald's and you order a fucking hamburger and they put a joke amount of mayonnaise on it because you say you want extra mayonnaise and they're like, okay, fine.
[201:11.30]And it's unedible.
[201:16.62]Oh, fuck.
[201:26.99]Um... I definitely have to get rid of him and then...
[201:34.11]Oh my... Jeez.
[201:35.25]Oh, come on!
[201:36.18]Is there another one?
[201:36.88]Thank God.
[201:44.45]Um... I don't... Even this is slippery.
[201:52.52]I don't go down this.
[202:01.90]Oh, man.
[202:04.56]I need to break him.
[202:06.68]Can't I smash him?
[202:07.92]I'm not going to be able to make this.
[202:16.85]I'm freaking the fuck out right now.
[202:28.06]Go down?
[202:28.66]Down's not gonna help me?
[202:31.60]Go down?
[202:32.30]Go down, go down, go down.
[202:33.58]You have to go down.
[202:35.58]What?
[202:41.98]No, I don't.
[202:42.46]Oh, you fucking dick.
[202:56.04]No, I was wrong!
[202:56.92]I was wrong!
[202:58.24]I was wrong to do that.
[202:59.78]I have to go back in this... How am I supposed to jump to there?
[203:03.86]I can't make that jump in that little sliver.
[203:08.72]I need momentum to make that jump.
[203:10.61]Do I have to land on that tiny little pixel?
[203:14.11]No!
[203:14.59]Fix it!
[203:24.50]No, see, it's over.
[203:26.72]I gotta get up here now!
[203:28.58]Move, please!
[203:51.04]I don't think I can make this.
[203:52.28]I'm gonna try.
[203:55.84]I can make it.
[203:57.48]Okay, I made it.
[203:58.64]Now I have to break these?
[203:59.40]I gotta just have some confidence, man.
[204:02.14]I'm just... No confidence at all.
[204:03.72]What?
[204:04.96]Um... What do I do now?
[204:24.25]Is there a spot?
[204:25.43]Is that land?
[204:26.17]Am I going to die?
[204:27.07]Do I have to jump on the bones?
[204:28.01]I don't know if there's land down here.
[204:35.04]Holy shit.
[204:39.08]Okay, but... The arrow is pointing down here.
[204:58.03]Alright.
[205:00.27]What?
[205:00.67]Is there a block that I missed?
[205:06.62]I guess I screwed something up?
[205:16.85]But the arrow!
[205:17.91]Yeah!
[205:18.95]There was an arrow!
[205:24.87]This streamer look very boomer.
[205:29.09]Does he?
[205:36.26]Did you see that?
[205:37.12]What just happened there?
[205:38.42]That's called a cat-like reaction.
[205:52.45]I gotta jump.
[205:53.21]Oh, you dickhead.
[205:54.57]What are you even doing here?
[205:59.66]Make my life a living hell.
[206:04.58]Alright.
[206:12.64]So now I just have to go around it or across it?
[206:21.55]I think I'm just going to try to jump gently here.
[206:27.27]Well, if he didn't throw the damn thing, I'd be fine.
[206:34.40]Oh no, I gotta bounce on his head to get up there.
[206:40.65]Alright, so why would I turn that on?
[206:42.87]Secret?
[206:48.01]Secret?
[206:57.52]Is there a key?
[206:58.58]Where's the key?
[207:26.35]But... So... Where is it?
[207:31.19]It's not just a... It's a leap of faith, but... Hello?
[208:00.08]Maybe just walk off the edge?
[208:04.40]Why would the arrow be pointing down there if there's nothing there?
[208:17.83]Try trapping the fire in the blocks?
[208:19.41]That's not a bad idea.
[208:25.77]Just barely missed that one.
[208:45.81]It's actually really hard to do this, just that jump.
[208:58.45]I guess maybe I could get him killed, but...
[209:05.33]Alright, so... How do I get the key from... Alright, let's try this.
[209:10.89]I don't think this is going to do anything.
[209:15.01]Okay.
[209:49.69]Is there maybe a thing to climb?
[209:53.51]Whoa!
[209:54.57]Okay, that just scared the fuck out of me.
[209:57.07]Alright, so what the hell do I gotta... P-block this?
[210:07.91]And go on the coins down there, and then there's probably a P block down there?
[210:10.89]I don't have any idea, but I'm gonna go for it.
[210:14.93]There it is.
[210:17.27]And, yeah, okay.
[210:20.54]Alright.
[210:23.38]Yeah.
[210:24.46]Well, I'm gonna get it.
[210:25.68]I'm gonna get it.
[210:31.00]Of course you put it right where you have to jump.
[210:33.43]In both places!
[210:35.55]In both places!
[210:46.25]Fuckin' ice.
[210:50.81]Bakken gave $50.
[210:52.57]Bakken, this is your level, isn't it?
[210:55.48]Thank you for the 50 bucks, you say.
[210:56.82]I'm so sorry, I sent you the wrong code.
[210:58.62]I meant for you to play this one.
[210:59.86]I hate this level too.
[211:01.12]I'm so sorry.
[211:02.06]Wait, what?
[211:08.52]I don't... I think it's pretty fun.
[211:17.19]It's tough.
[211:18.35]It's tricky.
[211:22.42]That's a seal of approval to skip the level.
[211:24.68]I'm so close though.
[211:27.66]I gotta get that key and then be out of here.
[211:36.81]You can't skip now.
[211:38.23]Not now.
[211:39.43]Oops.
[211:43.94]That's perfect timing.
[211:45.90]That was the earliest hitbox I could have had.
[211:51.38]Okay, let's try it again.
[212:07.86]Ag is gonna be patient.
[212:10.06]The P is gonna... Alright, this also...
[212:16.14]I don't know if that's possible.
[212:18.10]I'm not sure it is.
[212:23.21]Alright.
[212:26.79]Okay.
[212:31.75]Here we go.
[212:32.33]I gotta time this right.
[212:37.59]So let's go right when it's on the way down.
[212:43.88]You bastard!
[212:45.65]It's all slippery.
[212:48.66]Where is it?
[212:54.40]The whole thing is slippery.
[212:58.24]Every surface is slippery.
[213:02.63]It's so slippery.
[213:06.23]Come on.
[213:18.54]Jeez, look at this ice!
[213:19.50]This ice is fucking ridiculous!
[213:31.68]Look at him go!
[213:51.98]Give me the damn thing.
[213:54.50]It's the one to the left.
[213:57.42]It's not right in the middle.
[213:59.06]It's right to the left of it.
[214:01.89]Alright, come on.
[214:02.71]I can do this.
[214:04.35]I just have to do it right.
[214:07.15]Look at the slipperiness.
[214:08.63]You saw it there, folks.
[214:09.65]Dude!
[214:13.31]Ugh!
[214:22.84]Everything is slippery.
[214:23.60]You understand how slippery everything, even the blocks, even these brown blocks are slippery.
[214:30.10]Alright.
[214:30.70]Okay.
[214:31.02]Everybody calm down.
[214:32.50]This is going to kill me, isn't it?
[214:38.96]What's the respawn rate on that?
[214:42.08]Should I just dive in there and hit up?
[214:52.45]What is that?
[214:52.89]Why are you doing this?
[215:02.32]Drop them both.
[215:04.30]Or at least... I'm gonna wait till you're on the other side.
[215:08.60]Like that.
[215:09.76]Holy shit!
[215:11.18]Okay, I'm overga- Everything's fine!
[215:14.79]Okay.
[215:16.29]Slow down.
[215:25.60]Is he gonna- He's gonna continue- I'm not gonna be able to make it.
[215:29.89]I can't make it.
[215:33.81]I can't make it.
[215:35.01]That's gonna hit me!
[215:35.65]Okay, I can make it now.
[215:42.76]Where's the key?!
[215:44.30]Where's the key?!
[215:46.30]There's another key!
[215:47.76]There's another key!
[215:49.32]Oh no!
[215:50.69]Where's the other key?
[215:52.29]Is it a hidden block?
[215:55.42]Oh no.
[215:58.07]Do I have to kill him?
[216:11.78]I don't think I can kill him.
[216:12.98]That's going to hit me.
[216:15.02]I don't think I can.
[216:19.54]I can't kill him.
[216:20.08]I don't think he dies.
[216:23.95]Shit, the little pixel at the end!
[216:28.47]He's dead.
[216:30.79]No, he's not.
[216:32.77]Um... Oh, you gotta be kidding me, man.
[216:38.74]Man!
[216:39.02]MAN!
[216:39.56]MAN!
[216:58.35]I got it.
[216:59.19]Oh, yes.
[217:00.13]Okay.
[217:01.03]I did it.
[217:01.41]I did it.
[217:01.67]I'm there.
[217:04.47]Thank God you have a checkpoint.
[217:07.24]There's nothing over here.
[217:09.50]Why would you have this?
[217:19.10]Thank God.
[217:20.14]I was so mesmerized by the super escalator.
[217:26.43]What is that going to do when I touch it?
[218:00.96]Oh, it's... Yucky?
[218:01.88]I have... Oops.
[218:30.30]Um, Yoshi can step on these.
[218:34.54]Right?
[218:38.11]What's with the scary music?
[218:48.11]Why did that Yoshi just die?
[218:50.16]Okay, now I need a new Yoshi.
[218:52.40]I need a new one.
[219:00.31]I thought that was going to kill me for a second, and I was about to be very sad.
[219:02.67]I don't even need to do this.
[219:09.05]Just jump.
[219:10.83]Okay, this is just freaking me out here.
[219:19.47]Way too much movement.
[219:28.80]I'm going up top?
[219:42.83]Oh, this is... Is this... No, here it is.
[219:47.46]There it is.
[219:48.36]What does this do for me?
[220:13.16]Where's he going?
[220:16.00]No, what?
[220:20.28]I need Yoshi.
[220:45.31]Well, now I have Yoshi.
[220:48.61]Excuse me.
[220:49.69]Excuse me.
[220:50.41]Excuse me.
[220:52.09]Excuse me.
[220:54.71]Okay.
[220:55.83]I have Yoshi now.
[220:56.91]Oh, excuse me.
[221:06.89]Come here.
[221:08.99]Stop getting so scared.
[221:11.81]It's not even scary.
[221:14.05]Trust me.
[221:26.42]Oh, no, no, no, not like this.
[221:33.69]What's wrong with that?
[221:39.41]Alright, then we go up.
[221:44.04]So then I gotta ride it up there.
[221:45.68]So where is it?
[221:50.47]Okay, I get it.
[221:51.29]Swing myself up and jump.
[221:53.90]Oh, no.
[221:54.28]This is going to take me up there.
[221:57.88]Okay.
[221:58.18]Uh...
[222:22.18]Pig?
[222:22.90]So just... I did need Yoshi.
[222:31.73]It's a good thing I got him.
[222:36.41]You can't beat this without Yoshi.
[222:40.11]Another checkpoint.
[222:41.11]Well, you know, let me tell you something.
[222:43.06]Thank you.
[222:43.86]Because if there was no checkpoint here, I would have quit this level.
[222:47.30]If getting to this far and dying...
[222:50.76]Thank you for that.
[222:53.68]Two ways.
[222:54.22]I just wasted both of these.
[222:57.72]Just in case anyone's curious.
[222:59.10]That was a complete waste.
[223:00.58]100% waste of resources.
[223:04.80]What?
[223:05.30]I'm so confused.
[223:06.64]I just got a key.
[223:07.36]Can I do it with being small?
[223:21.92]I'm fine.
[223:25.58]Watch out for those pixels.
[223:28.46]Okay.
[223:29.29]That's the easiest jump I've had to do all night, and I just seriously just closed my eyes and just died.
[223:43.23]Well, now I'm not going to waste these.
[223:44.60]Let's try it again.
[223:52.12]Really?
[223:52.40]I didn't make that?
[223:53.26]How did I not make that?
[223:54.12]That's bullshit.
[224:02.69]I thought that was a tunnel to go into, not tunnels that turtles came out of.
[224:21.13]Chasing the gold until I die.
[224:28.07]What?
[224:28.49]What?
[224:28.93]Okay, did you see that?
[224:30.57]I want to make sure that people rewind that.
[224:32.49]Get a clip of that because why did I speed up?
[224:35.43]Why did I go so fast?
[224:37.07]Why is it going?
[224:37.59]I don't get it.
[224:39.19]Why am I going so fast?
[224:41.55]Well, Jeremiah, it's because you have forward momentum.
[224:43.17]No, I don't.
[224:48.50]Almost did it again, but I saved it.
[224:59.03]Okay, one key.
[225:00.53]You know what?
[225:01.51]Kill that guy.
[225:03.51]How many keys do I have?
[225:06.25]Can I store them?
[225:06.87]I don't think I can store them.
[225:16.55]Don't touch it.
[225:17.65]Alright, let me try to get through this member.
[225:19.03]I can do it.
[225:20.15]No, I usually go by now.
[225:22.53]I screwed it up.
[225:25.16]I usually have momentum here, and I make the jump, but now I'm all screwed up.
[225:28.40]Yep, see?
[225:30.70]I told you, and I knew it was gonna happen, because I waited too long.
[225:36.01]Watch out for this.
[225:42.29]He was about to just telefrag me.
[225:45.79]Uh-oh, I gotta go now!
[226:06.92]Ambushed.
[226:07.44]I gotta go this way first.
[226:09.44]See, when you got that momentum, you just go and you get it done.
[226:16.24]I won't get hit by anything, except for that one pixel I told you.
[226:21.57]This bone shit's really starting to piss me off.
[226:33.94]I got... I'm itchy.
[226:35.60]I'm breaking out hives right now, I think.
[226:40.03]Did I say that I was going to smoke a cigarette earlier?
[226:43.39]Don't do that.
[226:45.70]It's not good for you.
[227:05.03]Oh, you can't be serious here.
[227:13.16]Food.
[227:15.78]This is gonna be hell.
[227:18.54]This is gonna be hell.
[227:21.04]Yeah.
[227:23.50]I think so.
[227:27.18]Uh, gotta get that side done first, because there is... I'm probably gonna say close to 100% no chance...
[227:33.75]that I will do this side last.
[227:37.29]So I gotta be confident and get this one done.
[227:42.56]However I do.
[227:43.40]You know what I mean?
[227:45.88]Alright.
[227:50.64]What if I just don't spawn them?
[227:52.41]No, they're gonna be spawned.
[227:53.47]What if I drop their wings?
[227:59.18]I think I have to... No, I can't take him out.
[228:00.47]There's no way I can get them.
[228:02.33]Maybe if I... I guess I can, like, drop the wings.
[228:07.41]But then he'll just be on the ground, right?
[228:08.61]I think I just made it worse.
[228:12.15]Because those bones fill up the whole screen.
[228:18.72]You ain't gonna fucking do that.
[228:32.11]might as well just call it quits right there if I don't make that I could go for a smoke right about now no don't smoke
[229:00.22]Why did it not jump all the way?
[229:01.82]That was... Gas just flew up out of my body.
[229:11.16]I'm not gonna do this shit.
[229:12.04]I have to... I'm gonna try to stand right here.
[229:14.99]Are they spawned?
[229:17.41]I don't think they're here.
[229:19.23]The game doesn't know that they're here.
[229:20.49]Okay.
[229:21.97]It's possible.
[229:24.69]It's possible.
[229:35.35]I'm just gonna take a buzzer to my head.
[229:36.89]It's just like this hair falling down in my mouth.
[229:50.40]Hair clippers.
[229:52.66]Hair buzzers.
[229:56.22]Guys.
[230:00.30]Alright, get over here!
[230:05.23]That bone is gonna screw me over here!
[230:08.71]Slow down!
[230:17.28]No, it just takes up too much real estate.
[230:18.94]They both gotta go!
[230:33.38]They both gotta go.
[230:34.56]They do.
[230:35.28]If they take up too much space, I gotta go right for them right in the beginning.
[230:45.55]I can't fucking believe it.
[230:46.55]The one time that that happens.
[230:48.73]The one time that it actually is high enough out of the fucking ground to hit me through the ground.
[230:56.49]What?
[230:57.43]And I... This little Mega Man area boss zone is starting to get under my skin.
[231:05.91]No, I'm not gonna make it.
[231:17.06]See, sometimes you gotta pull out and reassess the situation.
[231:23.73]Watch out, don't get hit by that one pixel.
[231:34.03]Okay.
[231:41.21]I gotta bait out one.
[231:46.26]Oh, man!
[231:47.06]There's no way that this- I don't- There's no way!
[231:50.70]There's no way!
[231:52.60]It takes up so much space!
[231:54.56]Why?
[231:56.01]There's no way!
[232:04.16]You can't jump on this part of the level!
[232:06.20]There's no jumping.
[232:12.85]That guy wasn't even throwing at anything.
[232:19.86]He just was whipping a newspaper into the wall.
[232:25.16]I did it again.
[232:25.70]I'm going the other way.
[232:44.96]I'm gonna cry foul on that.
[232:47.50]Because, what the- I'm crying foul on it.
[232:58.04]It's fucking slippery.
[232:59.32]Every single thing is fucking slippery.
[233:03.00]It's driving me MENTAL.
[233:32.61]No, it's slippery, man!
[233:36.05]I'm gonna play a normal level after this, and I'm gonna be terrible.
[233:39.41]Terrible, terrible, terri- I can't even jump over you!
[233:43.06]I can't jump over this!
[233:44.14]Yes, I can!
[233:59.56]It's on now motherfuckers.
[234:33.26]I'm freaking out.
[234:39.34]I got up.
[234:41.42]Okay, now.
[234:43.53]No!
[234:45.05]That's what you have to do.
[234:51.57]It's the sliding around.
[234:53.45]It's the sliding around that really causes the problem for me.
[234:59.92]It's the sliding the, ah!
[235:04.60]You know that I'm literally shaking right now.
[235:09.12]I'm literally shaking.
[235:21.17]And crying.
[235:21.99]Alright, just stretchy ass neck.
[235:31.31]I keep, man, when you have to hold down so many buttons at the same time, and you just worry about fucking, I swear, man, this slipping fucking bullshit.
[235:41.42]I'm going to slide down my stairs.
[235:44.04]I'm going to baseball slide down my stairs and go through the front door.
[235:49.21]I'm going to put a slip and slide on my stairs and just wet it and just slide down as fast as I can.
[236:03.83]Thank God there's another mushroom, because it's so- it's not even- no, and you fucking- you fucking blew it again.
[236:31.95]I can't believe it.
[236:33.81]Why?
[236:34.38]I just wanted to restart from the checkpoint.
[236:44.46]This icy motherfucker.
[236:47.26]I'm not doing it again, but I'm so close.
[236:49.32]You gotta be kidding me.
[236:56.92]Why do bad things have to happen?
[236:59.92]Why?
[237:01.06]What if I do it in one go?
[237:02.64]I can't believe people are gonna come to the stream back from like 40 minutes ago and they're gonna be like, you're still here at the beginning?
[237:20.31]No, I'm not.
[237:21.47]I'm not.
[237:22.17]I started over.
[237:24.13]Accidentally, I pressed the wrong button.
[237:28.21]Tender, where's the confirmation that you want to start from the beginning of the level without the checkpoint?
[237:31.27]Where's my confirmation?
[237:32.33]I'm fucking over.
[237:35.31]Shit, I'm so... It's over.
[237:49.12]Come on, controllers.
[237:50.58]I'm so... I'm just like mutated right now.
[238:01.30]If you did like a scan of my brain right now, the doctor would be like, what the fuck is happening?
[238:05.74]I don't understand this.
[238:06.58]How do you have lion brain?
[238:13.87]Have you eaten potato chips like too many?
[238:24.95]How is your DNA mutated?
[238:26.13]I don't get it.
[238:30.05]And he doesn't cough into his hands right in my face.
[238:32.01]Sorry, sorry.
[238:35.51]I finally did it.
[238:36.07]That's the first time I've ever done that.
[238:37.17]See, we're gonna get it.
[238:39.83]We're gonna get it, like, perfect first.
[238:42.34]Remember this part?
[238:42.92]I remember this part.
[238:43.60]Easy.
[238:49.96]Remember this part?
[238:53.58]I do.
[238:54.30]Oh, press that before you click the switch.
[239:03.91]Holy shit!
[239:05.99]It's so bad.
[239:07.61]Like, that's such a bad, bad area to fall down in.
[239:10.77]But I made it.
[239:14.92]I can get back there.
[239:18.96]Oh my god, remember this part?
[239:20.18]Yup, I do.
[239:21.86]It sucked.
[239:25.16]Oh, it sucked!
[239:26.26]Oh, it sucked!
[239:27.50]Jeremy!
[239:29.88]Wait!
[239:30.22]You gotta get the thing.
[239:38.27]Jeremy?
[239:41.17]Jeremy?
[239:42.05]Almost there.
[239:55.76]Oh, I remember this part.
[240:03.46]This sucked.
[240:06.13]No, it didn't.
[240:06.55]It's just patience.
[240:07.69]It's just patience.
[240:08.89]And I'm already back here, so we're good.
[240:11.15]I can beat it.
[240:11.77]I can do it.
[240:14.61]I know I can.
[240:16.90]Forget about this jump scare.
[240:18.56]It's not real.
[240:22.76]I thought... Press that button.
[240:53.39]No, stop that.
[240:55.63]No, let me go!
[240:56.43]Let me go!
[240:59.33]Forget it!
[241:17.13]I've fallen.
[241:18.01]I've fallen off the edge here.
[241:20.27]Oops.
[241:29.93]I need Yoshi.
[241:31.51]I don't- I need Yoshi.
[241:32.63]I have to- I have to go jump over here.
[241:34.39]I need Yoshi.
[241:34.95]Oops.
[241:38.77]Guys, and why did I get stuck on the guy's body?
[241:44.50]I got stuck on his head!
[242:00.45]Do you guys think that people throw up from playing these levels?
[242:05.71]I swear to god, people puke from these.
[242:17.28]I'm talking full on, like you have to run to the bathroom, because it's... Good job, I did it.
[242:28.95]What?
[242:30.11]Where did he go?
[242:31.83]Slow down, don't... Everything is fucking icy.
[242:34.79]Why?
[242:35.73]Just get on Yoshi, please!
[242:36.91]Get on him!
[242:37.81]Get on him!
[242:38.71]Oh no!
[242:51.96]Just ride it over.
[243:00.07]I need to get over here.
[243:01.21]I'm not even done either.
[243:06.11]You stupid bastard.
[243:08.64]What have you done?
[243:09.44]You're lucky.
[243:11.32]You're lucky that you didn't just make me mad.
[243:24.29]You ever eat so much that you feel sick and you throw up?
[243:26.93]That's called overeating and you shouldn't be doing that.
[243:30.39]Once you get to about 80% full, you should stop eating.
[243:33.45]And then after about 20 to 30 minutes, your hunger reflex will turn off.
[243:37.26]And you will not be hungry at all.
[243:40.26]Just a quick little tip.
[243:42.22]Oh no.
[243:46.64]Okay.
[243:47.90]Back where I was before.
[243:49.94]Almost, right?
[243:51.92]Getting there.
[243:54.08]This is it.
[244:00.07]Made it.
[244:00.71]Everything's fine.
[244:01.37]We're good.
[244:05.58]Now I just need to complete it.
[244:07.18]Yeah, I was watching Mario Maker.
[244:30.79]There was this guy that was streaming.
[244:32.43]And he was, he like, he SUCKED at the game.
[244:35.89]No way, really?
[245:05.87]You know when athletes, after they... play a tough game, they sit in that, like, fucking ice bath?
[245:15.18]I'm gonna have to- I think I'm gonna do that.
[245:17.18]How much are those?
[245:17.74]Are they expensive?
[245:32.27]No, it's ice.
[245:33.57]No, that's not what I'm talking about.
[245:35.68]Notice how I went backwards?
[245:37.12]Notice how I went backwards so I didn't make sure I didn't kill him.
[245:50.96]Where... really?
[245:51.98]Come on.
[245:52.76]Where did that even come from?
[246:00.58]I need this!
[246:07.55]Okay.
[246:11.29]Didn't get the first one.
[246:11.95]I thought I could get the first one with one little... You dick!
[246:19.16]Okay, I got one.
[246:19.94]One is dead.
[246:21.12]Is that enough?
[246:22.54]Might be enough.
[246:26.36]Dude.
[246:26.72]Dude.
[246:31.04]Dude, this part.
[246:34.09]It takes you like six seconds to start moving.
[246:38.82]Look at this.
[246:41.56]That's a full six goddamn seconds.
[246:44.46]I don't even care about that one.
[246:52.13]Oh, that was... I'm really happy about where that hitbox was.
[246:56.31]It's just... I'm so happy about it.
[246:58.89]I will sing about it. ...
[247:12.07]I just, uh, throw things forward and there's nobody there, but I throw them.
[247:17.43]I just throw.
[247:19.81]Why you don't, you don't throw?
[247:22.25]No, no, I don't, I want something to be in front of me.
[247:25.09]No, I do know.
[247:34.88]I do know.
[247:39.64]Don't bring Otto into this.
[247:46.74]That's not auto?
[247:50.42]This is auto.
[248:21.43]This part is the worst.
[248:23.27]This is the worst.
[248:26.89]There's nowhere to go.
[248:28.33]You have to get that shell in there and you have to kill them both.
[248:31.07]There's nowhere to go.
[248:32.09]There's nowhere to go.
[248:35.15]You have to get over there.
[248:37.20]With the shell.
[248:38.18]And get them both.
[248:39.16]There's no other option.
[248:50.30]Get it in there with full health.
[248:53.40]Like my dad used to say.
[248:55.31]Get me to the last castle with full health.
[248:57.71]No, with eight lives.
[248:58.85]And I'll beat the game.
[249:00.11]And he would.
[249:01.01]We just have to get him there.
[249:04.05]Sorry, dad.
[249:04.73]You have one health.
[249:08.98]Oh, no.
[249:09.80]Really?
[249:10.14]You got me.
[249:10.66]That's two.
[249:10.98]That's two.
[249:11.26]That's two.
[249:11.52]That's two.
[249:13.48]I got it!
[249:14.72]Give me out!
[249:15.72]I didn't even... I accidentally just beat this.
[250:14.28]I'm the only person that's done it?
[250:25.59]That's... wow.
[250:34.25]Only two completions and 749.
[250:36.43]Wow.
[250:41.05]Don't make me fucking angry here.
[250:43.29]These are cute, but... Careful, girl.
[250:50.29]Careful.
[250:52.49]I enjoy you, but be careful.
[251:02.46]That's a beautiful auto.
[251:09.59]Calm down, bud.
[251:10.27]This one's way easier.
[251:11.85]Jerma's a good streamer.
[251:12.69]I appreciate him.
[251:13.57]Look!
[251:14.29]Cleared required.
[251:23.04]Should have skipped.
[251:23.84]There's Fireman.
[251:34.34]I mean, like, come on, man.
[251:36.16]What is this?
[251:37.63]You've wrote a paragraph in here.
[251:40.15]Hey, my good friend Jeremy found a hilarious level that simulates how it is to be short.
[251:44.07]As a seven-foot man, you'll love it.
[251:46.39]I can't TC897VDYF.
[251:50.43]That's how I write checks.
[251:53.35]You know, you get to the end, you're like, $245 and security is raising cents.
[252:03.54]You could have put that a little more legible.
[252:06.86]But, you know what?
[252:08.48]For the effort, I'll do it.
[252:12.49]I see 8, 9, 7.
[252:15.05]V, D. Y, F. Why would I report that?
[252:22.29]How do you all make ice levels?
[252:24.58]It's my turn.
[252:27.66]I'm gonna write this one down, too.
[252:28.82]I'll write this down.
[252:29.44]Okay.
[252:29.80]It did say... He did say it was his... It was my turn, so...
[252:39.90]G4T, A2K, WH, G, okay.
[252:53.31]53 minutes ago.
[252:55.63]How do you guys draw on the Switch like this?
[252:58.45]Well, I guess you can use a stylus, right?
[253:01.99]Did we already do this one?
[253:10.27]That's a pretty... You know, that's a good enough Mario where I'm gonna write this one down.
[253:12.75]Alright.
[253:13.11]7, 6, N, E, 1, C, A, R, F. Let's go through these.
[253:19.42]And then we're not gonna do any more from the comments.
[253:21.52]We're gonna go into the chat after these three.
[253:27.08]Let's start with this one.
[253:29.58]T... C... 8... 9, 7...
[253:40.83]V d y f let's give it a try puzzle solving short and sweet this is by Gary the snail it's called super ball black and white original super Nintendo super original Nintendo black and white not cake Mario or cake luigi but it's close
[254:12.01]Oh, I remember this thing!
[254:13.15]The little... Oh, now you got my attention.
[254:22.07]Game Boy.
[254:22.79]You gotta skee-ball it around.
[254:25.59]Ooh, this is gonna be fun.
[254:29.54]Can I do it?
[254:35.22]Nice.
[254:38.08]Yeah, it's a skee-ball level!
[254:40.78]This is so happy.
[254:43.86]Now this is the kind of salad level that I'm talking about.
[254:47.14]Yeah, this is the salad level that I wanted.
[255:10.04]I remember this... What was the one... What was the Mario Game Boy game where you flew around in that ship and you... You shot out the little pellets?
[255:19.76]What was that?
[255:23.49]Did I get it?
[255:27.29]What am I looking at here?
[255:28.09]Like I hit the pow.
[255:30.75]Mario Land.
[255:31.47]That's the one.
[255:32.17]I missed that game.
[255:33.05]That game was so much fun.
[255:40.15]Come on, get in there.
[255:41.33]Get the POW.
[255:49.34]It still exists?
[255:50.16]Yeah, but I remember... What I'm saying is I remember playing it, and I remember being really happy.
[255:56.32]And it was this same song.
[255:57.66]What a good song.
[255:59.80]Did it get up there?
[256:04.76]Ding dong, ding dong.
[256:06.87]I think I have to activate these...
[256:15.43]Is that not getting in there?
[256:18.93]Where's it going?
[256:20.41]Is it despawning?
[256:22.19]Okay, cool.
[256:44.04]I'm going to have to bounce it from here, I think.
[256:48.88]Yeah, like right here.
[256:52.76]Ding-dong.
[256:53.40]How many more?
[256:54.38]I'm going to have to bounce it.
[256:57.03]I'm probably going to have to bounce it up.
[257:02.31]Or maybe not.
[257:13.73]But I guess... I don't.
[257:17.20]No, I don't.
[257:17.86]This is gonna be hard.
[257:21.06]Alright, get it?
[257:22.92]Right here?
[257:23.50]Shit.
[257:23.78]Sans.
[257:24.00]Sure.
[257:24.18]It's your thing.
[257:44.79]Come on.
[257:50.65]I know this is the right place.
[257:51.61]Okay, wait, wait.
[257:54.33]One, two, three.
[257:56.61]There.
[257:57.67]Hopping around.
[258:01.10]This one's gonna have to travel.
[258:10.46]Bounce it up off the wall twice.
[258:12.30]One, two, and then yeah, probably like two.
[258:14.66]One hop off the ceiling, two hops off the ceiling.
[258:21.51]We're right down in the middle here.
[258:22.97]Yeah.
[258:23.55]Again?
[258:24.97]I think this is gonna hurt me.
[258:42.53]This is gonna hurt me, isn't it?
[258:47.31]I guess that's what I was supposed to do.
[258:49.45]Uh... I think?
[258:49.95]You gotta... I think I have to grab you?
[258:52.31]Yeah, you gotta grab the little gopher.
[258:55.31]Oh no, don't tell me you're stuck there forever.
[259:13.99]Bring him down here.
[259:17.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[259:17.73]Get him, get him.
[259:18.15]Okay, now I'm going to move out of the way.
[259:19.95]And drag him down there.
[259:20.97]I'm going to transfer him.
[259:27.25]No, transfer.
[259:31.30]Transfer!
[259:31.90]You dope.
[259:43.55]No!
[259:43.97]Put him down!
[259:45.95]I'm trying to drop him on the treadmill!
[259:47.41]But the... the hand keeps getting stuck.
[259:49.13]Alright, grab him, and then you have to put him down.
[259:52.07]Put him down this way.
[260:15.92]No!
[260:17.94]Put him down!
[260:20.11]Get over here!
[260:20.95]No, you idiot!
[260:24.15]Where are you running to?
[260:26.99]This way, quick!
[260:27.79]What?
[260:27.99]I thought maybe I could kill him.
[260:43.53]I don't have a flower.
[260:45.31]Oh, damn it.
[260:46.98]I thought I could kill him.
[260:48.82]It's alright.
[260:55.82]No!
[260:57.34]Shoot him.
[260:57.68]I didn't have any flower.
[261:12.67]Leather belt leather belt leather belt leather belt leather belt.
[261:15.67]What do you mean leather belt?
[261:21.24]Leather belt leather belt.
[261:22.78]What does that mean?
[261:25.14]You guys are doing like a 13 year old World of Warcraft reference right now
[261:42.82]Put your cam on.
[261:45.38]I don't think I will.
[261:46.18]Come on, spawn him!
[261:51.98]Yep!
[261:52.26]You want my webcam on?
[262:12.92]What's it gonna add?
[262:13.82]It's not gonna add anything.
[262:16.08]Tell me what it's gonna add.
[262:18.38]Oops.
[262:19.20]My beautiful face.
[262:21.22]Aw, well, isn't that sweet?
[262:23.12]It's very sweet of you.
[262:44.41]We can see how sweaty you are.
[262:45.81]I mean, I look like, I probably, I look like shit.
[262:48.98]I can probably guarantee you that.
[262:49.94]I'm just gonna add my face value.
[262:57.02]Well, you guys, the reason why I don't have to do facecam is because I don't want to turn the facecam on because it's, I can just, I can be, I can look whoever, however I want.
[263:05.77]And I don't have to worry about people looking at me and going like, holy shit, his hair looks like dog shit today.
[263:09.96]And I'm like, I could look perfect right now.
[263:13.84]Your image of me right now is me in a nice three-piece fucking suit.
[263:21.47]And I got my hair gelled back.
[263:23.13]I got a clean shave.
[263:24.81]I look great.
[263:26.35]Just have that memory.
[263:27.15]Have that in your mind.
[263:28.83]You don't even know what I look like right now.
[263:33.51]Now here's the issue.
[263:34.65]What the hell do I do about this?
[263:40.95]Somebody did that for me.
[263:42.49]I don't even know how that happened.
[263:51.95]There's your answer.
[263:52.73]Alright, drag him over here.
[264:02.63]No.
[264:04.49]You're causing me all kinds of fucking pain right now.
[264:16.14]Let him go.
[264:16.72]Let him go!
[264:17.78]You made it!
[264:20.68]Stupid.
[264:35.71]Hey, I did it.
[264:36.53]What?
[264:36.67]He's an idiot!
[264:37.67]He's an idiot!
[264:39.89]He shouldn't be following me around, running back and forth in circles.
[264:43.09]He's stupid.
[264:45.47]And he had the key.
[264:54.85]What the fuck?
[264:55.27]I hate this streamer.
[264:56.15]No, you don't.
[264:59.79]60% completion rate.
[265:01.46]That was a fun one.
[265:02.04]Let's take a look at what people had to say.
[265:10.25]What the hell?
[265:13.13]Not enough ice.
[265:15.77]Clear required.
[265:16.69]Alright.
[265:18.43]Well, no more of these from the comments.
[265:20.56]I want to do these next two.
[265:22.18]And then pull in some from chat.
[265:25.66]But there's the ID.
[265:26.42]That was really fun.
[265:27.04]That was cool.
[265:27.52]It was like a little skee-ball one.
[265:31.24]This is so fun.
[265:32.85]What a fun game.
[265:36.43]G4T.
[265:41.17]A2K... A2K... WHG.
[265:55.88]Red Coin Castle.
[265:59.38]This is apparently pretty hard.
[266:01.84]Very hard one.
[266:03.45]It's short and sweet, but only 1% completion.
[266:10.68]Why do I sound so stressed out?
[266:11.88]I'm stressed out.
[266:13.04]What are you talking about?
[266:14.00]I'm as cool as a cucumber right now.
[266:22.71]Red coin castle.
[266:27.81]This thing's only like 30 seconds long.
[266:31.03]Well, that's not the right way.
[266:40.72]That is not the right way to go, because it's rising.
[266:44.84]And I need to check these.
[266:47.02]How much does it rise?
[266:50.24]All the way?
[266:50.58]I just need, I gotta examine.
[266:53.70]Oops.
[266:57.96]Why is it normal to eat a handful of pickles and not a handful of cucumbers?
[267:03.97]Why are you eating a handful of, what do you mean a handful?
[267:13.85]That's not abnormal to eat a handful of cucumbers.
[267:17.45]What's so abnormal about that?
[267:20.92]Ooh, I didn't see that.
[267:22.38]Have you never eaten a cucumber before?
[267:25.26]Wrong.
[267:43.17]I've eaten like two or three cucumbers before.
[267:47.71]You just cut them up and you put salt and pepper on them and they're perfect.
[267:51.21]What's the big deal?
[267:53.49]I need that.
[267:57.43]Salt, pepper, and a little bit of olive oil.
[268:00.08]It's good.
[268:01.28]It's not weird.
[268:04.08]It's not strange.
[268:05.40]That's a snack.
[268:06.72]It's a very healthy snack.
[268:16.10]Yikes, how do I do this?
[268:21.56]Probably should go underneath.
[268:28.04]It's this way.
[268:32.46]No.
[268:38.20]Drop spin jump, dummy.
[268:40.72]Ban that guy, please.
[268:57.13]Shit.
[268:58.51]There's a lot of explosions going on.
[269:12.11]I love that old Yoshi's Island coin sound.
[269:16.29]Come on.
[269:17.07]That didn't touch the top of his head?
[269:31.61]Come on, you're making me look bad.
[269:33.25]How many coins are there?
[269:33.93]Three?
[269:35.51]That's not terrible.
[269:43.26]Where did you... I was... I didn't... I was trying to get that one... bait that one.
[269:49.96]This guy's skills are insane.
[269:53.34]Thanks.
[269:54.94]I've been practicing a little.
[270:01.94]Who's playing?
[270:02.44]He's awful.
[270:03.80]His name's Jerma985.
[270:05.04]He was a YouTuber for a while, and he made the switch to Twitch.
[270:11.80]He's been doing it pretty much regularly.
[270:18.20]He's really nice.
[270:18.86]He's a really nice person, too.
[270:20.10]Like, I met him in real life.
[270:22.02]He signed my face, and... Look at this.
[270:28.91]Ffff.
[270:38.24]Just gotta be patient here.
[270:46.48]That thing's gonna come back and haunt me, I know it.
[270:50.14]That was not intentional.
[270:55.38]That was not intentional.
[270:56.34]The stupid button just was pressed.
[271:00.29]I would much rather that be like left or R, L or R or something or right bumper or left bumper or something.
[271:05.41]Why does it have to be just down?
[271:10.13]How many times did they test this?
[271:14.18]Why is it just down?
[271:17.76]Why can't that just be like right bumper?
[271:22.30]Right bumper, left bumper, right trigger and left trigger are the same thing.
[271:30.93]That's four different buttons you can press to do the spin.
[271:33.65]You gotta press down to ground pound.
[271:35.79]I disagree.
[271:36.89]No.
[271:37.22]Shit.
[272:07.28]That one's fired.
[272:13.98]Here we go, up.
[272:17.94]Alright, now I gotta go... No, what the fuck, man?
[272:27.65]The stupid co- I'm gonna rip this thing out.
[272:30.61]I'm about to give up.
[272:44.90]I can feel it.
[272:45.40]I can feel the Yeti levels of fucking getting uncontrollable levels.
[272:50.40]I just, that was really redundant what I just said, but you understand.
[273:02.16]Three?
[273:03.74]No, what the fuck, man?
[273:06.30]It was, it was right there, and I just like fucking fat-fingered it.
[273:11.84]God, I need like two...
[273:18.16]I thought it was- I thought it was lava and it freaked up because- doesn't it rise?
[273:23.40]What the fuck?
[273:24.90]I would have just done it too, but why is this not rising?
[273:35.39]That's the thing that confused the fuck out of me, and I didn't even get the first one.
[273:40.71]It is rising, so how far- hold on, how far does this go?
[273:46.53]Alright, so you can't effectively get down there, and so you have to be really careful, because the lava will just be up there and fucking scorch you.
[273:53.31]What happened there?
[273:55.41]Out of here.
[274:23.96]That was dumb shit I've ever seen in my life.
[274:25.56]Ah!
[274:26.62]Ah!
[274:55.18]Nintendo, what are you thinking?
[275:31.80]Can I unbind down?
[275:37.22]I feel like not having a ground pile would actually- if I had to go in and toggle it back on, it would probably be better for me.
[276:00.03]I have to wait till that top, this one shot.
[276:02.41]Oh no!
[276:03.57]I'm throwing in the towel on this one.
[276:27.88]I'm only gonna give this one- I don't wanna spend like an hour on this one.
[276:31.95]No, no thank you.
[276:47.25]Is it gonna fire?
[276:48.07]Oh, what the fuck is it doing?
[276:49.31]Is it still hanging out somewhere?
[276:56.10]Go down!
[276:58.40]And then... I think I have to ground pound it.
[277:03.60]I do.
[277:08.08]Alright, the lava's up.
[277:10.66]Wait for the lava to go down.
[277:15.06]Get the third key piece and then get the hell out of here.
[277:34.17]Give me a checkpoint.
[277:35.26]I deserve it.
[277:36.80]I did it.
[277:37.10]I beat it.
[277:37.54]Holy fuck.
[277:38.76]Yeah!
[277:41.82]I'm a winner!
[278:04.97]Yeah.
[278:07.24]I did it.
[278:17.24]Jerma, look at chat.
[278:17.96]Okay.
[278:19.82]I'm looking at it right now.
[278:23.34]What is it?
[278:25.04]Jerma Minion?
[278:26.30]Jerma, don't smoke, please.
[278:27.34]I'm crying and shaking right now.
[278:28.68]I don't smoke.
[278:32.32]Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
[278:34.60]Mama.
[278:38.32]Cucumbers are a normal snack.
[278:46.09]Pretty cool.
[278:47.43]No, no, god damn!
[278:48.67]No, man, I just want to get out of the level.
[278:50.27]I don't want to report somebody.
[278:52.73]I swear to god.
[278:55.25]They make that really easy to do.
[278:58.12]You can really easily accidentally just press A.
[279:02.34]That was good.
[279:03.28]That was tricky.
[279:04.20]That was hard.
[279:05.14]I was willing to put like an hour into that one.
[279:07.90]Alright, there's one more that I took from the... And then we're going to do chat ones after this one.
[279:16.64]76NV1C 8RF.
[279:22.04]After this, I'm going to take a break.
[279:24.42]I'm going to go grab something to drink.
[279:25.82]I'm going to use the bathroom.
[279:30.89]It creates a new Mario adventure to commence fight length enjoy 12 short and sweet 25 seconds Mario's area That's what I would do if I was in front of the cannon, you know what I'm saying
[280:12.60]Alright, any stuff in here?
[280:14.87]Sometimes it's like little secrets, and there is.
[280:17.37]There's the mushroom.
[280:19.37]Gonna get that too.
[280:26.27]Go inside?
[280:26.79]Yeah!
[280:27.11]There's a couple of these big- oh, this is a flying thing!
[280:35.07]How does this- did you just hold B and it's like a Yoshi fly?
[280:39.27]What's that?
[280:40.51]Is that good or bad?
[280:42.61]Is there a pumpkin head costume or something?
[280:44.77]See ya.
[280:45.45]Can I... I can jump on this right?
[280:53.87]With my magical foot?
[281:08.94]You need that.
[281:09.86]Well, that was cool.
[281:11.32]There you go.
[281:12.40]Nice.
[281:14.50]That was a cute little level.
[281:17.03]They're all cute.
[281:17.59]I've got news for you.
[281:29.12]Not enough time to leave a comment on this one.
[281:32.30]When can we expect Jerma Rumble 2019?
[281:33.49]That's funny.
[281:39.83]People are using the comment sections on somebody's level to ask me a question about Jerma Rumble.
[281:48.77]See, to the person that made this level, if they're not here right now, that person is asking them that question.
[281:57.62]And they're going to wake up tomorrow and be like, what the fuck is this person talking about?
[282:06.50]I don't know.
[282:08.02]I don't have an answer for you.
[282:11.62]What is Jerma Rumble?
[282:13.26]Do they think that's the name of this level?
[282:17.39]I can't give you an answer.
[282:18.03]I don't know.
[282:20.05]By the end of the year, for sure.
[282:25.31]Question Dodge?
[282:26.23]No, I just gave you an answer.
[282:31.97]Alright.
[282:33.71]Uh, I see this one here.
[282:34.69]This one looks potentially interesting.
[282:36.43]Let's get this one for when I get back.
[282:40.19]I'll be right back.
[282:41.27]I'm going to take a quick pee.
[282:42.37]I'm going to grab some water.. See you in a minute or two.
[283:03.92]you
[283:31.77]Thank you.
[284:00.38]you
[284:14.97]Thank you.
[284:43.78]you
[284:57.96]I'm going to use the same method for the other side as well.
[285:25.11]you
[285:40.02]Oh, hello again.
[285:42.38]How do you do?
[286:12.88]I'm going to copy this one.
[286:14.58]Somebody has a decent looking one here too.
[286:19.78]Let's try this one.
[286:35.14]Go to McDonald's and get a McChicken.
[286:38.96]Oh, I probably will.
[286:39.76]Yeah, I will.
[286:41.68]That's a great idea.
[286:47.06]Alright, um... F-C-T... L-2-T.
[286:53.20]9-3-G.
[286:57.42]This is apparently a single screen puzzle.
[287:05.84]Munchers block the way.
[287:09.02]Use all the items you can to destroy the seemingly endless door of Munchers.
[287:14.31]Okay.
[287:19.60]The chickens are like gum.
[287:20.78]They stay in your digestive system for three years.
[287:26.07]Well, I would... I'm probably going to have to go get, like, surgery.
[287:28.41]Because I've eaten, like, 40 of them in the last, like, year or so.
[287:31.59]Alright, so... Hold on, I think I already blew it.
[287:34.63]Alright, so... Wait a minute.
[287:36.39]On... Music...
[287:46.76]wood gold alright we got four elements here so when I pick up one okay I just picked up a coin and I just turned it off what is it hold on what about the shell oh dear so the right coin moves I gotta get the shell
[288:16.60]So this right... What is this doing?
[288:27.79]I need to get that shell on the top left.
[288:30.03]Huh.
[288:30.55]So...
[288:45.35]that's on but what is that what happens over here let me try to get the middle one okay so that turned on the blue
[289:04.37]So then turn the red back on, which is the middle one, right?
[289:08.79]I'm killing them.
[289:11.83]What does the left and right ones do?
[289:13.35]Left.
[289:14.71]Doesn't look like it's doing anything.
[289:21.50]Oh, that's blue.
[289:27.28]The coin order doesn't matter.
[289:28.68]Oh, okay.
[289:56.95]Oh, I see.
[289:57.76]I see.
[290:28.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[290:31.99]Oh, wait a minute.
[290:39.56]Would you look at that?
[290:40.84]Okay.
[290:42.00]You have to just jump up here.
[290:48.74]So I screwed it up.
[290:50.62]So I have to go back.
[290:51.46]I mean, this isn't working.
[291:02.65]Can I pick up the POW?
[291:04.22]Wait, hold on.
[291:04.62]Alright, so everything's dead.
[291:06.88]Now can I go up there?
[291:33.53]Oh, come on, don't do this.
[291:34.37]Oh, the time!
[291:36.75]The time, the time, the time!
[292:07.30]Jump up high.
[292:21.19]How high do I have to... Can I just use this?
[292:42.29]Alright, that's gone now.
[292:43.25]Let's see if I can get up there.
[292:44.19]I just want to put it down.
[292:48.18]I'm trying this one one more time.
[293:13.86]No one else will ever die in that spot.
[293:18.02]Easy.
[293:25.87]I just gotta get up top, because then... Let's make it blue, then I can go in the tunnel?
[293:36.68]In the pipe?
[293:46.89]Okay.
[293:48.41]Now this gets rid of the... Who cares about the coin?
[293:51.97]I'm not even gonna get it.
[293:52.61]I just want to place this here.
[294:01.62]Oh, shit.
[294:02.14]I have to switch the thing.
[294:04.40]Don't die by this spike.
[294:05.30]Don't die by that spike.
[294:06.14]Don't die by that spike.
[294:06.96]Don't die by that spike.
[294:09.00]Don't die by the spike.
[294:18.77]That was so, so careful, too.
[294:25.86]You saw how careful I was being.
[294:27.24]I was trying to be so, so... It has to be blue.
[294:33.10]But no, I can't even get up there if the blue is switched.
[294:38.93]I'm so confused.
[294:43.71]So do I need to use the POW?
[294:45.67]How do I switch it when I try to get up there?
[294:51.09]Maybe I shouldn't take the POW.
[294:56.67]Maybe I should throw the POW when I get up there.
[295:06.68]There's not even use the POW, but then how do I trigger this to open the door up to the...
[295:15.30]Oh, I'm gonna put it down.
[295:17.26]Does this blow everything up if I place it?
[295:19.20]No.
[295:19.56]Okay, so now... Get up there.
[295:21.82]Can I get up there with this?
[295:24.04]And then throw it?
[295:24.70]Um...
[295:45.95]I was trying to go put it on.
[295:47.79]I guess I... I was gonna just go put the helmet on.
[296:00.72]Did I not?
[296:01.30]I don't understand.
[296:06.54]Can I not just walk up and grab it?
[296:08.76]Or did I touch it too... I have no idea.
[296:12.75]Let me see.
[296:21.25]No, I don't think I can get it.
[296:26.05]Alright, I'm moving on.
[296:46.06]Have you finished a level yet?
[296:49.08]No, in five hours I haven't beaten one level.
[296:51.70]Zero.
[296:51.84]Let's try this one
[297:16.19]The spore meme is still alive.
[297:30.95]5CG.
[297:37.21]Tower to the sky.
[297:40.35]Stairs out of order.
[297:41.39]Ride the elevators at your own risk.
[297:43.12]Going up.
[297:45.10]Pretty good description.
[297:50.41]I only played Spore for 25 minutes?
[297:52.71]Yeah, because it was flashing everybody in the face.
[297:55.93]It was bad.
[297:59.64]That was actually very bad to play.
[298:01.88]It was potentially going to hurt somebody.
[298:03.94]Elevators.
[298:13.29]Well, you got a good music choice, first of all.
[298:20.35]Ooh, hammer brothers Mushroom, come on!
[298:24.49]Ooh, that's better, even better Oh, can I get overwhelmed here?
[298:29.06]Oh my goodness
[298:50.53]Are they both going the same way?
[298:53.43]Kind of, no.
[298:54.09]What's in there?
[298:55.39]Who cares?
[298:56.93]Oh my god!
[299:00.77]Up, up!
[299:01.45]What do you mean up?
[299:06.79]Ooh!
[299:12.43]Oh my god!
[299:16.04]Ah!
[299:16.56]Too many!
[299:17.52]Too many!
[299:23.80]Ah, the music really sets me.
[299:25.82]I need to be able to see.
[299:28.61]Nice, fire flower.
[299:54.23]Get it!
[299:54.95]A lot going on.
[299:58.33]It's not worth going up there.
[300:06.36]Maybe it is.
[300:06.88]No, it's not.
[300:07.72]There's no checkpoint, so it's not worth it.
[300:08.96]I thought there was nothing there for a second.
[300:22.66]That was pretty good.
[300:25.28]Got a little chaotic at the end there, but that was really pretty good.
[300:38.77]Only two people have played this.
[300:40.97]Two out of two.
[300:42.73]100%.
[300:45.02]What do the people have to say?
[300:48.28]Cool.
[300:49.12]Nothing.
[300:50.80]Happy birthday.
[300:51.46]Thank you.
[300:54.89]There's nothing even there.
[300:55.81]Did your comic get deleted?
[300:58.05]Alright, I see one here.
[301:04.58]Let's grab this one.
[301:07.78]Alright, this one.
[301:21.51]So this person says this is baby mode.
[301:24.09]Now I don't know if that's an ironic statement, because this is one of those impossible ones, or if this is actually a really easy one that's going to be very, very simple for me to do.
[301:35.78]Time will tell.
[301:37.86]I don't know.
[301:44.02]Goku in Smash.
[301:45.80]Well, I think it's probably going to be pretty easy.
[301:54.47]Puzzle solving.
[302:02.68]Goku, really?
[302:05.82]Goku Smash.
[302:55.71]This one?
[302:56.17]That's funny.
[302:57.66]Okay, we got one here.
[303:03.58]Goku and Smash.
[303:06.38]Nice.
[303:09.82]This is YH1.
[303:10.34]C4H.
[303:10.46]Q8G.
[303:27.19]land of the trees a more relaxed approach at Mario Maker my first level you've already got my attention a relaxing level land of the trees
[304:02.43]I'm not relaxed.
[304:05.95]I didn't know they can't... Just wait.
[304:18.84]They look really cool.
[304:21.64]Wait, hold on.
[304:24.58]They're really shiny.
[304:30.48]I love the way that those fishes look.
[304:31.98]Cool.
[304:33.92]This is fun.
[304:35.32]This is actually pretty relaxing, now that you mention it.
[305:04.81]Who would put that in the water?
[305:05.89]Okay, wait for the fishes.
[305:20.41]He died to a relaxing level.
[305:24.63]You can still die.
[305:29.79]That's not anything to be made fun of for.
[305:38.40]There's a secret up here.
[305:41.19]What does that say?
[305:43.73]Hold on.
[305:44.37]Oh, that don't matter.
[306:09.91]This ain't even a P-Pants level.
[306:11.37]What are you talking about?
[306:12.27]This is not a P-Pants level.
[306:13.81]Alright, well that was kind of a P-Pants moment right there, but it's alright.
[306:20.60]Shoot, what am I doing?
[306:40.08]And you're talking and making references and doing a voice poorly.
[306:45.49]And it's distracting enough where you can't do anything else.
[306:49.95]You literally cannot do anything else when you do that.
[306:53.83]So stop it.
[307:08.76]You peed my pants.
[307:10.83]Okay, those McChickens sound really, really good right now.
[307:17.29]After a long day of screaming and nearly crying and shit.
[307:24.08]My god, I can't wait for, like, a McChicken sandwich.
[307:28.14]Oh my god!
[307:29.10]What the hell?
[307:37.77]Can I beat the fish?
[307:38.59]I think I can beat them.
[307:41.05]No, I can't.
[307:47.62]You suck.
[307:48.64]No, I'm just drained.
[307:50.80]I'm drained.
[307:51.42]I've had- My body is drained.
[307:59.59]I'm gonna lose to the fucking bug again.
[308:12.50]That was unblocked.
[308:13.66]McChicken with, uh, mayo, and that's it.
[308:38.43]That was cool.
[308:38.87]That was cool.
[308:39.23]That was pretty good.
[308:40.09]It was.
[308:40.55]It was fun.
[308:43.85]Alright, should I take the one where somebody says putrid level?
[308:50.38]If you have that kind of description, I'm not sure that's the one I want to do.
[308:58.84]Um, well, I'm going to try.
[309:03.67]K59...
[309:10.63]2RM?
[309:12.57]Nah, no lettuce on it.
[309:16.45]Not from McDonald's.
[309:19.95]For some reason, I don't know what it is about sometimes when you go to McDonald's and you get lettuce on your sandwich.
[309:25.81]It's this wilted, hot, gross, disgusting, filmy, just tiny, thin, filmy, hot thing.
[309:35.22]It's like a wet napkin on your chicken sandwich.
[309:39.04]Not very appetizing.
[309:43.08]Sludge surfing in space.
[309:46.05]Okay.
[309:49.65]It's like cooked spinach.
[309:50.73]Yeah, but it doesn't taste as good as cooked spinach.
[309:53.67]It tastes like a napkin.
[309:58.37]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[310:04.60]I gotta get in.
[310:05.00]Alright, let's go sludge racing.
[310:08.06]Good music choice.
[310:11.72]Can I not go in?
[310:18.95]Oh, sorry.
[310:19.93]My pee pants actual lizard brain saw that the arrow is pointing down.
[310:32.28]This is not putrid.
[310:36.38]This is pretty good.
[310:37.26]What's wrong with this one?
[310:42.20]It doesn't protect you.
[310:49.68]Come on, that doesn't give me... That should give me something.
[310:52.90]That should protect me at least 5%.
[310:55.48]5% less damage from Toxic Poison.
[310:58.44]Toxic Poison.
[311:02.96]So I got a question for you guys.
[311:05.86]So this is... This would be Mario Maker Stream technically number 3.
[311:09.46]Do you want to see this again?
[311:13.51]I'm willing to do it again.
[311:16.09]In small dose.
[311:16.86]It's pretty fun.
[311:26.32]I guess it's pretty creative.
[311:28.08]People are pretty creative.
[311:29.00]It's fun.
[311:30.50]I need to hit that.
[311:32.26]I don't know what's... Oh, shit.
[311:39.67]Okay.
[311:39.93]Yeah, actually, I have to be careful.
[311:43.83]I go in this pipe?
[311:45.93]I'm scared to get with it, whatever this is.
[311:51.10]He's dead, right?
[311:51.88]He's dead.
[311:53.56]I'm gonna go get it.
[311:54.14]Holy shit, how did I not get hurt?
[311:56.70]Oh, fuck.
[311:57.04]What is it?
[311:57.38]What is that?
[311:57.86]What is it?
[311:58.36]It's just a... It's a bait.
[312:02.34]Okay.
[312:13.97]Was it worth it?
[312:18.52]No, I didn't... I thought it may have been something cool.
[312:20.88]It's just an extra shroom.
[312:23.56]What did it cost?
[312:25.60]Uh, you know the answer to that question.
[312:40.50]No, get up, get up!
[312:42.08]Okay, easy.
[313:02.28]Alright, now I want to go... I want to get that bump that's up there.
[313:05.22]This bump up here.
[313:06.76]I'm going to bump it.
[313:08.04]And then up.
[313:08.66]Got it.
[313:09.16]But it's just a mushroom.
[313:26.01]I just hated the hearthstone.
[313:29.96]what do you mean what what do you mean why'd you hate the hearthstone stream why what's wrong with it what was wrong with it you're gonna hurt me what was I too tall I was just too tall for this how can I thankfully the checkpoints right there
[314:00.47]Now I'm small.
[314:01.57]This should work out.
[314:02.27]Mushroom.
[314:07.93]Got it.
[314:09.67]I think I waited too long.
[314:11.21]Dead.
[314:11.49]Yeah.
[314:11.73]Dead again.
[314:33.80]I don't know why I have this weird urge to like tell you very loudly what's about to happen and that is so hard to even do.
[314:41.63]Even if I tried to do what I just did again, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[315:02.99]These are some rare deaths.
[315:04.49]Yeah.
[315:06.15]I'm so paranoid about hitting the edge there.
[315:13.10]Alright.
[315:15.56]That's enough time, right?
[315:17.20]Yeah.
[315:17.78]Oh.
[315:31.50]I'm just... I'm coasting right now.
[315:33.72]I really am.
[315:34.40]I gotta just like stop coasting.
[315:36.62]I'm getting up.
[315:37.44]I was leaning back in the chair.
[315:43.73]You're the greediest streamer ever.
[315:45.67]No, I'm just coasting.
[315:49.53]I'm no longer coasting.
[316:01.93]Not sure what's over here, but... Oh god.
[316:10.19]Blind jumps.
[316:11.01]That's not smart.
[316:11.81]What's down here?
[316:13.95]Uh oh.
[316:14.59]Duck.
[316:33.12]They come down, they come, there comes another one right... Eee!
[316:39.87]Caught that right at the edge.
[316:52.21]Anything weird I can do over here?
[316:54.31]Kind of, I can go this way.
[316:56.94]Oh, you idiot.
[317:03.94]I need to know what's up there.
[317:06.52]What's up there?
[317:07.16]Should I damage boost it?
[317:12.14]Oh.
[317:32.52]I'll get 200 bits if I beat your level!
[317:35.02]Oooooh.
[317:36.36]Isn't this what I just did?
[317:40.26]Didn't I do this one already?
[317:51.09]It would be an honor if you could do mine.
[317:53.75]You got it.
[317:54.23]Let's go.
[318:02.41]I will pay $20 if you do a McChicken stream.
[318:13.27]Alright.
[318:14.68]What do you mean?
[318:15.22]Like, just eat a McChicken on camera?
[318:21.72]You will pay me $20 if I eat a McChicken on the stream.
[318:29.69]Are we clear on that?
[318:39.70]Why?
[318:45.60]Now, we don't... There's no speed.
[318:48.34]There's no do it in a minute.
[318:51.40]It's just simply eat it on the string.
[319:05.15]Okay.
[319:08.19]I'm gonna do it.
[319:09.69]Like, what's the problem here?
[319:13.33]Uh, this is Vinny's level I'm gonna put down to do next.
[319:19.05]I'm just, just one, right?
[319:21.78]I mean, I'm gonna buy four, but I'm only gonna eat one on stream and then I'm gonna turn stream off.
[319:34.53]This is the weirdest thing I think I've ever had requested.
[319:36.68]Can I pay you $20 for you to eat a McChicken?
[319:45.28]That's such a ridiculous return on investment.
[319:48.31]A McChicken is a dollar.
[319:49.43]Alright, well I got a couple more written down here.
[320:02.06]Thanks for the fun level, it was pretty good.
[320:04.89]I'm gonna do this one.
[320:05.89]H-O-M.
[320:12.34]This shit is so cool, though.
[320:13.36]It really is.
[320:13.80]Imagine back in the 80s telling somebody this was gonna be possible.
[320:28.33]This is never-ending content.
[320:29.83]Mario's Vacation Tower Heist.
[320:32.56]It's a day off here and Mario would like to go robbing Bowser again.
[320:39.57]Okay.
[320:41.59]Would you get in a bathtub of mac and cheese for $100 and stream it?
[320:44.31]No, I'd have to be way more than that because I would destroy the bathtub.
[320:47.89]The box... The amount of macaroni and cheese it would take to fill a bathtub would be like $500.
[320:51.19]It wouldn't be $100.
[320:58.87]It would fuck up the whole bathtub and... How many... You don't understand how many boxes that is?
[321:02.84]Oh shit.
[321:05.36]It would... Yeah, that would probably take at least 50 to 100 boxes to fill the whole bathtub.
[321:18.16]I... I was trying to do something cheeky over there.
[321:29.28]Just cover the drain.
[321:32.02]Uh, yeah.
[321:35.22]What do you mean, just cover the drain?
[321:42.89]Look at that rat having a good time bouncing around.
[321:48.23]I'm busy looking at the rat.
[321:49.69]And I think I've died.
[321:51.17]I think I've been killed.
[321:52.37]I have to be over on the left side.
[321:59.45]Technically, you didn't say you wouldn't do it.
[322:10.49]Um... Guys, I am not going to fill a bathtub with... Um, let me deny that now.
[322:19.54]I'm not going to fill a bathtub with macaroni and cheese and scream for 300 bucks.
[322:25.82]That's not gonna happen.
[322:29.57]Alright, now I gotta get across here.
[322:34.62]Did I already blow it?
[322:37.30]Am I gonna be right here?
[322:39.66]Damn!
[322:40.20]Alright, I'm gonna be up top on top of that and then up to the left.
[322:52.24]No, I'm not... No amount of money is going to have me do that.
[322:56.86]What am I doing here?
[322:58.68]Oh, Jesus.
[322:59.10]Okay, um...
[323:19.18]Just dropping Goombas.
[323:20.44]Um... So then... How do I... What do I do?
[323:28.01]Let's go!
[323:32.09]What the fuck?
[323:33.21]Okay, and... Then we go... I... Goddamn Wii controller!
[323:42.34]Switch controller!
[323:43.50]Down, ground, pound!
[323:45.70]Bullshit!
[323:56.68]It should be one of the triggers!
[324:01.63]It's so easy to accidentally press this shit all the time!
[324:19.18]Uh, Veleni gave $50.
[324:19.90]Thanks for the $50.
[324:22.62]Thanks for the $50, Veleni.
[324:26.98]Huge money.
[324:28.22]This is probably McChicken money.
[324:30.14]Uh, if I were to take a guess.
[324:33.32]I wonder.
[324:33.74]I haven't read it yet.
[324:34.89]So, I think it's McChicken then.
[324:36.05]Let me see.
[324:36.41]Oh my god.
[324:36.79]Oh my god.
[324:49.72]That just freaked me out.
[324:50.70]The fucking thing's falling.
[324:52.70]Um, Jerma, I'll give you another 50 bucks.
[324:55.91]I'll give you 5,000 bits if you wash down the McChicken by chugging a Mountain Dew throwback.
[324:59.35]No.
[324:59.77]I'm not doing that.
[325:06.31]Thank you for the $50, but I'm not chugging a Mountain Dew throwback.
[325:10.92]I will have a stomach ache.
[325:14.14]I will have a problem.
[325:16.10]It's not good for my health.
[325:25.50]Alright, why do the guys just scream and fall down?
[325:29.12]Oh, Luigi, you dummy.
[325:40.00]What the fuck it's not what I didn't touch the flag and why is the level go so slow
[326:03.84]I jumped over the flag!
[326:34.26]No, you bumped your fucking head on the goddamn ceiling and it lost- Alright, why do you not attach to the wall like 25% of the time?
[327:03.77]It's only in this, like, new Super Mario fucking Five Toads game that this happens.
[327:08.81]Where the fuck am I?
[327:10.53]Oh.
[327:36.81]Oh, I wonder what happened.
[327:37.89]I wonder what happened.
[327:39.17]Watch out, Regina.
[327:39.81]I'm going to be careful.
[327:40.75]He's going to be able to take off all his powers.
[328:13.91]Goku you must have accidentally pressed down on the d-pad.
[328:18.73]What happened?
[328:20.73]Maybe if you gave me the controller I'd be able to take care of it real easily.
[328:36.25]No, it's too hard!
[328:46.75]It's too hard!
[328:49.17]Why am I turning into the guy from Ghostbusters 2?
[328:53.71]Why am I dripping with goo?
[328:58.31]He is Vig!
[329:00.75]The most unbelievable man!
[329:18.06]I gotta wait.
[329:19.04]Till it switches.
[329:20.00]And then now I have to go.
[329:21.17]Ready?
[329:21.47]That's not what I have to do.
[329:24.73]At all.
[329:25.39]That's incorrect.
[329:30.07]It's only a game.
[329:30.75]Why do you have to be mad?
[329:31.75]Because it's fucking hard and it makes me upset.
[329:38.45]That's why.
[329:39.29]And I can't even see.
[329:43.97]It's not just a game.
[329:46.15]This is not just a video game now.
[329:48.71]This is a task that I need to accomplish.
[329:52.20]Lucky.
[330:00.26]I'm going to fucking freak out.
[330:21.29]It's the accidental ground bounce.
[330:24.96]Oh my god.
[330:31.70]Don't ever tilt somewhat in the direction of down.
[330:41.15]You'll go straight into the ground.
[330:49.01]I think I need a big chicken.
[330:49.95]I would rather eat a big chicken than press down on the D-pad accidentally on this dumb controller.
[330:57.52]I'm turning the webcam on, because I want you to see this.
[331:09.12]This is important to me.
[331:23.02]Down.
[331:23.64]I'm down.
[331:24.32]Oh, by the way, if you want to use these... My thumb covers the whole entire thing.
[331:32.89]I'm trying to press this button.
[331:34.11]If you use that... No, it's not even better.
[331:36.79]You're going to press them all.
[331:43.96]Get a pro controller?
[331:44.88]I REFUSE!
[331:53.61]Oh, I had it!
[331:55.29]Get a GameCube controller.
[331:58.03]I refuse!
[331:58.53]No, I don't like the pro controller anyways.
[332:13.79]I wish I could just use a PlayStation 4 controller.
[332:16.55]We're all talking about working together and having all kinds of... Oh, yeah.
[332:20.61]Let's get everybody on stage.
[332:21.95]We're all in this together.
[332:23.47]Microsoft, have you seen Banjo-Kazooie?
[332:25.91]Yeah, I want to be able to use the Xbox controller on the fucking Switch.
[332:29.54]You know, when we all play together, we win.
[332:33.66]Except by my service.
[332:36.20]Oh, my God.
[332:40.86]They may as well just start shoving each other on stage.
[332:42.92]No, now get out of the way.
[332:44.08]It's my time.
[332:44.82]You should be... We're all in this together.
[332:46.72]Get out of the fucking way.
[332:47.64]It's my time.
[333:03.02]It's just not being able to see!
[333:06.32]Play Fallout 76.
[333:08.26]Why does it have to be scrolling so slow?
[333:30.50]You can use an X-Bow control, I refuse
[333:59.89]I can't wait to make $20 to eat a McChicken.
[334:01.84]In like, 10 minutes.
[334:02.60]No!
[334:02.72]God.
[334:25.43]What happened?
[334:26.09]Oh my god.
[334:27.67]I don't ever want to play New Super Mario Bros.
[334:29.64]3D Wii dickhead fucking ground grab the fucking side of the building thing.
[334:34.30]I ain't playing this game.
[334:35.04]This is the worst Mario.
[334:38.78]I'm not playing this one.
[334:41.27]I'm so glad I skipped this one.
[334:51.04]You see when I get the Mario 3 or Cake Mario levels?
[335:01.51]It's over.
[335:02.71]It's over.
[335:20.44]Give me a Cake Mario level.
[335:21.38]I'll beat it in two tries.
[335:22.20]You've seen it.
[335:23.39]I don't even need to explain it.
[335:32.42]I can't even grab that shit.
[335:33.74]It's over.
[335:34.38]I was trying to get the...
[335:43.90]You're scaring me.
[335:46.80]Just get a McChicken, you'll be fine.
[335:48.26]Yeah, McChicken's way better than a Snicker.
[335:53.56]I never plan to play this one.
[336:01.58]It's so funny, when I want to actually have the ground pound happen, I feel like it doesn't happen when I press the button.
[336:05.58]It only happens when you accidentally turn into Mr. Satan.
[336:16.75]I'm gonna tap this like three or four more times and I'm gonna fucking shove McChicken into my mouth.
[336:32.10]You can't go too fast because the scroller goes too slow that you just die!
[336:40.06]I don't even know what he can kill me.
[337:08.79]camera moves up if you go off too far off screen it does not I was just up there
[337:39.71]I'm gonna skip it.
[338:05.90]Oh my god, this is this is I Oh
[338:33.25]Really?
[338:33.89]Really?
[338:34.31]What the fuck is this and what are you doing?
[338:37.39]What the hell are you doing?
[339:11.22]I- I'm- somebody has to- I have to skip this one.
[339:15.36]This is gonna make me freak the fuck out.
[339:19.20]But I've- it's like- it is sunk cost fallacy, just rearing its ugly ass head.
[339:48.74]Has he beaten the level since he skipped the boss one?
[339:59.39]You're just saying this shit and it kept me going!
[340:23.44]Wow.
[340:51.39]Why in a game where you have to press a fucking bunch of face buttons and move and tilt and control... Why is down a GROUND POUND?
[341:04.33]Huh?
[341:08.01]Am I the only fucking person doing this?

[345:21.86]Give me the car.
[345:22.70]Just don't drown.
[345:23.62]Mario, please.
[345:25.32]No!
[345:26.24]No!
[345:52.62]I'm not going fast.
[345:53.54]Alright, I'm gonna... This is where I calm down.
[345:58.00]This is where I just relax.
[346:00.01]This is where I'm gonna just relax.
[346:04.15]It's not even that big of a deal.
[346:05.77]Just do it.
[346:06.33]Just get it done.
[346:11.45]You don't even need the car.
[346:12.45]It's actually easier without the car.
[346:14.57]Don't jump, idiot.
[346:17.31]Pay that guy for one more round.
[346:44.37]I want to turn off the meme horn.
[347:01.14]I can't... Okay, right here.
[347:11.87]What the fuck?
[347:13.27]Knees fall, too.
[347:15.18]What the fuck am I doing?
[347:24.20]Just hold right in the car?
[347:25.14]And I was under the water.
[347:25.90]It was gonna make me... You don't just have to hold right.
[347:31.29]Watch what happens!
[347:31.89]I'm gonna hold... I just got tire mark on my face.
[347:37.21]Did you see that shit?
[347:38.35]Look at my eyes!
[347:42.54]I'm going fucking hollow!
[347:44.96]Alright, here we go.
[347:46.73]Ready?
[347:46.91]Watch this.
[347:47.25]I'm gonna hold right and I'll show it to you.
[347:51.05]Look!
[347:51.79]Look!
[348:18.38]It's not working!
[348:31.51]I won.
[348:35.29]Oh, right.
[348:42.80]Oops.
[348:48.93]15 fucking minutes.
[348:49.67]Boom!
[348:51.05]No, that's not fair.
[348:52.17]Alright, let's do Vinny's level.
[349:15.45]Please, play.
[349:17.41]Nightbot's dead.
[349:18.27]It's alright.
[349:18.75]Looking forward to the McChicken.
[349:19.61]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[349:20.34]I just said I was doing that.
[349:22.80]Am I actually eating a McChicken on stream?
[349:33.48]2%.
[349:33.56]I'm... I got more fucking milk fat than a goddamn grocery store.
[349:39.93]I don't know.
[349:40.67]Whatever.
[349:41.81]Make something out of what I just said.
[349:45.72]Yeah, Vinny's right here.
[350:05.56]Pipe dreams.
[350:08.41]And 1400 comments.
[350:14.77]5% completion.
[350:16.19]Am I gonna get angry at this one?
[350:23.05]Cake, Mario, you already got me sold here.
[350:43.97]Alright, nice coin placement.
[350:45.69]Nice coin placement, Vinny.
[350:48.03]Let me just check out the... I like... You got the fishes coming up and down.
[350:51.62]I would have had to be a little bit lower than that, but, you know, two each their own, right?
[351:04.62]The audio is super off again?
[351:06.12]Why does this keep happening with the Switch?
[351:22.15]Alright, this is the pipe dream part.
[351:25.31]Ooh.
[351:26.45]Sneaky.
[351:27.41]Sneaky.
[351:27.85]I would have moved him a little bit over to the right.
[351:29.53]Maybe choose three slots.
[351:30.37]But, you know, you do each their own.
[351:31.49]You're doing a very good job so far.
[351:36.31]Which one are they going to come out of?
[351:54.64]Watch it.
[351:55.60]Something up here.
[352:00.02]I know Vinny would hide something like this up here.
[352:03.60]He's got the intelligence to throw it up.
[352:05.24]Cool.
[352:06.38]Can I go in this one?
[352:14.93]Aw.
[352:17.83]Uh, the tide is rising.
[352:26.44]Hurry up!
[352:28.12]Hurry up!
[352:37.91]Nice.
[352:38.57]Ooh!
[352:39.75]Okay, easy.
[352:41.19]That almost just killed me.
[352:43.03]Not good.
[352:43.38]Get rid of this.
[352:46.36]Can I knock into that?
[352:48.76]No?
[352:55.04]Oh shit!
[352:56.60]Oh my god!
[352:57.74]Middle is the middle!
[353:01.25]Right in the nick of time.
[353:03.89]Now, we gotta go.
[353:04.89]We have to go now.
[353:07.23]I could really use this room right now.
[353:19.84]Thank god this is a Cake Mario level.
[353:21.32]Oh my, I shouldn't have said anything.
[353:26.72]I'm right here though.
[353:27.94]This level is actually pretty good.
[353:32.36]I already screwed it up, it's alright.
[353:59.04]I like the little jump vine to vine.
[354:00.44]That's a good little skip right there.
[354:09.14]Good little technique.
[354:13.48]Wow.
[354:17.00]Any, uh... Nothing.
[354:25.78]I need a mushroom.
[354:27.14]Bad.
[354:27.88]For this to keep going on.
[354:33.03]Watch out.
[354:43.17]Yep.
[354:43.31]Uh-huh.
[354:44.67]Okay.
[354:45.21]Watch out.
[354:45.57]Yep.
[354:45.95]Got it.
[354:47.29]Almost just died from that.
[354:49.49]Watch out for the one cheeto that's coming around here.
[354:57.54]I don't think I can get in these.
[354:58.66]He's gonna drop on me, I knew it!
[354:59.64]Another one's gonna drop!
[355:02.24]He's gonna drop!
[355:03.86]Okay, I'm fine.
[355:04.64]Stop screaming!
[355:05.80]I don't know what it is about these games, guys.
[355:07.42]I don't- I'm sorry, I'm screaming.
[355:19.67]Turn it the other way.
[355:20.29]Oh boy.
[355:27.42]That was a turn the other way.
[355:31.79]No, no, down.
[355:56.31]I just want the star!
[356:00.91]See, I love this song.
[356:05.49]I love the fucking heavy metal rock version of this song.
[356:38.51]a lot of those on YouTube.
[356:39.75]Oh no.
[356:40.55]If only 2,000 covers of that existed.
[356:46.57]Stop.
[356:46.75]Stop!
[357:06.84]I can hear it.
[357:07.50]I know what it sounds like.
[357:08.56]No, I'm not gonna go get it.
[357:17.79]I'm gonna beat this level.
[357:23.57]Vinny, this is pretty good.
[357:26.59]I know I'm talking like you're here right now, but it is.
[357:29.00]This is pretty great.
[357:38.63]I'm gonna beat Vinny's level!
[357:39.33]I'm gonna beat Vinny's level!
[357:42.81]Okay, thank god it was a cake.
[357:45.77]Mario level otherwise I'm not sure I would have been able to complete it.
[357:48.77]Uh, five minutes into the 54 seconds is... is the, um... That's alright.
[357:55.15]It's my first playthrough.
[357:55.89]Let's take a look at the comments.
[358:01.07]Let's see what they're saying.
[358:02.45]Nice job, Vinny.
[358:03.01]That was great.
[358:05.93]Vinny's not gonna know what you're talking about.
[358:26.40]Okay, I was not happy about this I gotta leave a comment
[358:49.32]How do I leave a comment?
[358:50.96]I beat the level.
[358:52.14]Did I already screw it up?
[358:53.08]Oh, I already messed it up.
[359:04.98]That was a good one.
[359:06.00]Nice job, Vinny.
[359:13.61]I want to get the true ending.
[359:14.61]Okay, this is apparently the true ending.
[359:16.25]I don't know what that means.
[359:21.45]Let's give this one a shot.
[359:23.46]3Q5.
[359:23.70]S42.
[359:23.90]L... L9G.
[359:46.65]This is called Koopa Forest.
[359:47.85]Collect all the pink coins for a little bonus at the end.
[359:53.88]True ending.
[359:55.84]He's starving himself.
[360:02.37]I'm fine.
[360:14.62]This is the true ending.
[360:16.82]I gotta get all the red coins.
[360:25.41]I love when you jump on these guys and you grab them and you throw them.
[360:28.77]If only they had an air freshener and a car freshener that smelled like that.
[360:32.51]You know what I'm saying?
[360:37.45]God, it'd be awesome.
[360:39.52]How do I get that?
[360:45.44]Did that give it to me?
[360:53.82]I put that off.
[360:55.31]This is an instant death if I... I'm gonna have to jump on somebody's head here.
[361:06.83]Boss fight?
[361:08.49]All the way through.
[361:11.89]Got it.
[361:13.45]I got a special key.

[361:33.67]Is there anything else over here?
[361:41.62]Okay, that's two.
[361:55.19]Funny, very funny.
[361:56.79]Oh God, easy.
[362:03.57]It's not safe, it's not safe.
[362:16.96]Oh, right, I'm done, I'm done.
[362:30.99]This game tears my soul out of my body.
[362:33.09]They're not doing anything for me?
[362:35.15]Okay.
[362:35.95]Where's that exit?
[362:36.91]I need the true ending.
[362:38.85]I need one more.
[362:40.33]P.

[363:45.99]Alright, let's try this again.
[363:47.91]So what am I just, what am I gonna run across this shit?
[363:52.25]Just die and hit damage boost and go?
[363:55.80]What have I done?
[364:16.11]Excuse me.
[364:21.03]Alright.
[364:22.68]Oh, coins.
[364:23.62]There they are.
[364:24.76]And... Go!
[364:25.40]I know what I have to do.
[364:47.60]I could have just ran.
[364:56.22]You stupid person.
[364:58.50]I could have just ran.
[364:59.74]What am I thinking?
[365:00.50]I could have just ran over it.
[365:01.46]I forgot it.
[365:02.92]That is... I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[365:06.92]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[365:08.20]I'm gonna laugh my fucking ass off.
[365:10.79]Dreamcast sucks.
[365:11.91]I'm laughing my ass off.
[365:44.83]Now, what does that mean?
[365:51.68]True ending!
[365:52.26]Here it is!
[365:58.76]So, the true ending is just the inside of a school cafeteria.
[366:20.41]I'm taking this quick thing because I need it
[367:03.91]No, I... I can't even go... Get... I just want to go up.
[367:12.26]Alright, I got the true ending.
[367:17.14]That was a cute little fun level.
[367:18.62]That was pretty good.
[367:19.38]I liked it.
[367:20.22]That was wholesome.
[367:41.18]My times are all so bad.
[367:43.83]But you can play these like five or six times in a row.
[367:49.41]That was very good.
[367:50.51]Nice work.
[367:52.19]What's next?
[367:53.61]I haven't even done Endless Challenge yet.
[367:55.57]It's been six hours, guys.
[367:57.37]Should I... I was supposed to do that.
[368:07.69]I'm going for it.
[368:14.14]We pick up right where we left off.
[368:22.22]Reclaim the temples.
[368:23.77]Multiplayer versus.
[368:26.83]What do you mean multiplayer?
[368:27.65]Is somebody in the game?
[368:33.65]McChicken?
[368:34.15]We got plenty of time.
[368:48.65]Watch out for this bullshit running from the sky.
[369:00.06]I'm telling you, man.
[369:03.10]You give me Cake Mario and I fucking get it.
[369:04.90]I go nuts.
[369:08.25]I would have had it, but... Hubris always ends up making it happen.
[369:11.35]I don't know why.
[369:15.27]When I say something, immediately it goes completely wrong.
[369:19.77]Why does it do that?
[369:20.95]Why does it happen?
[369:24.71]There has to be some magic power or something that just takes you over.
[369:27.75]Once you figure out that you're doing well and you say, I'm doing well, you just don't do well.
[369:32.47]I should talk about how bad I am all the time.
[369:34.99]And then I'll never, ever mess up.
[369:47.11]I mean, these are legit Cake Mario plays.
[369:48.73]They're terrible plays.
[369:49.71]They're awful.
[369:50.37]No one should fucking emulate these plays.
[369:51.88]They're terrible.
[369:52.36]They're dog shit.
[369:53.82]Absolute trash.
[370:27.90]I need three keys.
[370:29.10]Alright, I got it.
[370:32.53]There's one here, that's the exit.
[370:35.87]We go over the mall, people?
[370:58.71]Um, what?
[370:59.97]Should I just go in?
[371:04.34]I need those.
[371:06.14]Um, okay.
[371:06.90]I need the star to go over the whole thing.
[371:10.40]This is my first stream and it's a fucking mess.
[371:14.20]Welcome to the family, son.
[371:17.70]I gotta get all those again.
[371:51.26]What a fucking mess!
[371:56.18]What a fucking mess!
[371:56.96]What a fucking mess!
[371:59.42]Here we go, go!
[372:19.13]Why?
[372:20.57]Because I gotta.
[372:31.32]Thought I could make it.
[372:32.40]What's over here?
[372:33.66]Nothing.
[372:41.04]And they jump, and they jump, and they don't ever jump.
[372:42.87]They never jump, and we have to see, we have to take care of the fact that they sometimes, their programs jump.
[372:49.17]In this version.
[372:52.21]I'm gonna get killed by it.
[372:59.31]If you kill me, I swear to god, we're the same size.
[373:05.20]Alright, do it again.
[373:17.57]How do I do this?
[373:18.03]How do I get up there?
[373:18.59]How do I get up there?
[373:20.25]What?
[373:20.51]You got one of the rights of bait.
[373:26.61]I gotta reclaim the town.
[373:27.45]I'll get it.
[373:27.81]You have to jump on them.
[373:34.72]Don't make me eat a McChicken on stream, I will.
[373:38.37]I'm getting 20 bucks for it.
[373:39.35]By the way, I don't know how I'm gonna get this McChicken.
[373:42.21]This McChicken is, uh... Am I gonna get it?
[373:46.61]I'm not gonna be one of those people that gets McChickens delivered to their house.
[373:57.55]I have this invincibility!
[374:00.52]What?
[374:07.81]I am indestructible!
[374:09.51]What the hell was that?
[374:17.77]Oh, you're only invincible for some stuff.
[374:20.16]Is it a star or is it a star?
[374:24.18]Why did you tell me to do that?
[374:39.13]Get Uber Eats?
[374:41.31]Am I really going to be one of those people that gets the fucking McChicken delivered?
[374:47.59]You just, you're an asshole at that point.
[374:51.01]Like, you can't get yourself to McDonald's, like... Yeah, um, I'll take one McChicken, please.
[374:57.97]Can you make me drive all the way to McDonald's to bring you a McChicken or two?
[375:10.95]20 bucks.
[375:11.17]I might as well tip the delivery guy 20 bucks.
[375:14.43]I'm gonna put up with that buuuuuh.
[375:32.88]Uber Eats.
[375:34.36]McChicken.
[375:36.22]My mother would be so disappointed in me.
[375:49.59]I'll get fries too, but I don't want fries.
[375:52.45]I don't understand.
[375:54.59]I'm gonna... Endless was a mistake.
[376:00.81]Super Expert was a mistake.
[376:02.17]Endless was a mistake.
[376:03.61]I should have played levels where I could complain about the Switch controller.
[376:29.01]Was there a point?
[376:29.75]There was.
[376:30.23]Got it.
[376:30.97]Okay, that sucked, so I don't want to do it again.
[376:35.28]What do you mean, stop using the star in that room?
[376:38.50]That's what it's for.
[376:39.16]Alright, now that's one... There's two more down the... What is the other one?
[376:50.89]I think this one... There's one down here.
[376:53.57]That pipe right there?
[376:54.29]I'll get baited.
[377:07.79]Too many wrenches.
[377:22.86]Wow!
[377:23.28]I didn't know that happened.
[377:24.34]Whoa!
[377:26.14]Wow!
[377:38.20]Whoa!
[377:38.92]I just did a huge cartoon gulp.

[378:39.20]Yeah, I can.
[378:39.68]Just... I'm up.
[378:46.81]There it is.
[378:47.59]Two out of three.

[378:58.08]Ow.
[379:01.08]I need a mushroom.
[379:02.52]I've already done this one, but I don't really remember what's in here.
[379:05.64]I need this last one.
[379:08.05]It's down here, but what's down here?
[379:11.73]Oh no, it's this one!
[379:13.17]This one was really hard!
[379:39.81]R2-D2.
[380:04.77]I'm fucked.
[380:05.55]I'm sorry.
[380:13.74]Oh, right.
[380:14.28]I can wall jump.
[380:21.64]Isn't- No, that's R2-D2, right?
[380:23.86]I gotta slow down.
[380:26.90]My body's like going 5,000 miles per hour.
[380:30.73]I'm not a candidate to play these games.
[380:33.62]I do better off with, you know, match-three games.
[380:37.58]And, um... Hidden Object Adventures?
[380:43.71]One must just walk through there.
[381:11.52]Games for old people I'm an old person.
[381:15.16]I just said that that's my preferences hidden object games maps three games Ha
[381:41.23]I have to make a big, perfect jump I... I don't know!
[381:51.12]It frustrates me to no end That's not what I needed to do
[382:12.17]Did these go up?
[382:13.99]I don't know.
[382:15.65]How do I do this?
[382:17.91]No, no, no.
[382:18.55]You want me to jump around.
[382:22.39]Grab the edge and jump over.
[382:45.92]Okay, I thought I was gonna have to grab the edges.
[382:49.24]Jeremy, what have you done?
[382:52.81]You're embarrassing all of us.
[383:14.08]It's such a big tower, too.
[383:15.42]No!
[383:16.10]Easy, easy.
[383:17.26]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[383:20.69]Why?
[383:21.01]I want both of them.
[383:24.99]That's not gonna work.
[383:39.86]Yeah, I'm gonna fucking do that shit to me.
[383:41.96]Get rid of the ones over here first.
[383:50.00]Almost, almost, almost, slow, slow, slow, slow, you got it, you got it.
[383:59.00]I gotta keep- do I have to keep- huh? Keep- do I have to keep going?
[384:05.64]I'm losing my mind.
[384:06.18]Hold on.
[384:06.62]Why?
[384:07.26]I think I have to go up.
[384:08.46]Then I have to keep going up.
[384:10.70]Shit.
[384:11.06]I'm all the way down.
[384:16.53]I have to... I have to...
[384:47.62]If I could just shoot this controller out of a can in space, I would.
[384:53.60]If Elon Musk was like, hey man, you wanna like shoot something into space?
[384:56.52]We're doing like space shoot stuff.
[384:58.66]Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got something.
[385:00.68]What is it, man?
[385:04.05]Take this.
[385:08.73]Are you sure you want to do that?
[385:13.69]I mean, to shoot that out of the cannon into space is gonna be like six or seven million dollars.
[385:18.80]Worth it.
[385:19.20]Hey, uh, dude, I don't want to, like, sound like an idiot or an asshole here, but why don't you just get a pro controller?
[385:26.26]And I just scream and storm out of the room.
[385:35.30]Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
[386:04.80]No!
[386:05.38]God!
[386:19.94]That's so pres- it's so perfect.
[386:22.08]Why does everything have to be perfect?
[386:25.62]That's not how Bill Gates fucking- No, no.
[386:28.85]Miyamoto.
[386:30.67]I don't know who makes these fucking things anymore.
[386:34.40]Oh
[387:10.41]I'm gonna fucking eat a bunch of big chickens, man.
[387:12.83]It's gonna be glorious.
[387:15.25]Just think about the big chickens.
[387:16.23]It's all that matters.
[387:18.53]Nothing else matters.
[387:21.42]I tried to hit the... Okay.
[387:24.04]I pressed right trigger and he didn't... Send it to space, Elon.
[387:29.34]Get it up there.
[387:30.06]Now.
[387:32.66]Do you think if I threw it as hard as I could into the air?
[387:35.42]I did like three crow hops and threw it as hard as I fucking could into the air.
[387:39.60]I have so much anger against this thing right now.
[387:41.60]It would go into the stratosphere.
[387:42.79]It would get there.
[387:43.61]And gravity would pull it up.
[387:44.51]Fuck.
[388:07.09]Break the controller and I'll give you 30 bucks?
[388:08.65]No, I don't break shit.
[388:09.99]I don't break my stuff.
[388:10.89]I just complain about it over and over again.
[388:12.83]I talk about how I hate it.
[388:15.73]Like, shun it!
[388:43.93]Ah!
[389:06.96]Is this thing out of battery?
[389:08.04]Am I running out of battery?
[389:12.47]Okay, where's the coaxial cable that I can plug into this controller to make sure that it's not gonna run out of battery?
[389:20.23]I'm gonna fuck up my video game.
[389:21.99]It's really important that this is taken seriously.
[389:41.91]Alright.
[389:42.87]Attempt number, like, 300,000.
[389:43.79]To try to get up here.
[389:44.87]I'm up.
[389:45.51]Okay.
[389:46.25]Now, should I just ride it up?
[389:47.27]No, I don't think so.
[389:49.39]Okay, that's not gonna work.
[390:10.01]I think I do have to use them.
[390:11.21]Shit.
[390:11.61]I'm doubling up here!
[390:45.29]You gotta ride the cannons.
[390:46.37]I gotta jump from the cannon.
[390:47.49]I think this is bait.
[390:48.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[390:50.62]I can't- I'm gonna fucking- I'm gonna frisbee this big chicken into space.
[391:24.74]No, don't.
[391:25.36]Please.
[391:25.62]Take it easy.
[391:26.84]Let me just... Let me just talk for a second.
[391:29.78]I'm never gonna get it.
[391:31.63]I'm in an infinite loop.
[391:32.79]Infinite loop.
[391:33.67]Infinite loop.
[391:35.47]Infinite loop.
[391:37.53]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[391:56.05]Oh, it's almost time.
[391:57.07]It is almost time for like, just give up and eat my chicken.
[392:00.21]But I need to order it.
[392:02.75]I'm going to fucking scream.
[392:17.88]attach to the wall luigi I'm holding the button the button is being held on the wall am I still live
[392:50.24]Hello?
[392:50.56]I almost accidentally restarted my computer.
[393:01.95]I'm fucking livid right now.
[393:03.55]I almost restarted the computer by hitting Windows and then accidentally pressing, like, escape three times.
[393:22.02]This is my last shot, and I'm gonna skip this level.
[393:25.99]This level's really cool.
[393:28.33]Fuck that diarrhea cannon section.
[393:57.82]There's something wrong!
[394:02.62]There's something ACTUALLY wrong!
[394:05.06]Because it won't do it!
[394:06.63]Check the battery.
[394:25.25]I... I can't even have the satisfying, like, throw the cartridge out of the console.
[394:41.17]They're... They're like as big as mini SD Strive card things.
[394:45.85]You best just eat them!
[394:56.24]You must just put it under your tongue and it'll dissolve.
[395:00.98]This is the last try and then I'm moving on from this one.
[395:25.66]Get me back up to the cannon.
[395:29.12]And then just get it over with.
[395:32.04]Please.
[395:32.50]Not enough!
[395:55.44]Finally, two.
[395:57.22]No!
[396:28.50]If only I could see it!
[396:30.62]I s- Okay!
[396:31.89]Here it is!
[396:33.75]No it's not!
[396:36.19]You can't get up there like that!
[396:41.59]You can't do that!
[396:57.09]So how do I get up here?
[397:03.45]If you miss, you miss and it's over.
[397:04.81]Bump your head on the ceiling.
[397:07.91]I don't understand.
[397:29.82]I'm getting so many one-ups.
[397:35.62]That's not what I wanted to do.
[397:38.56]Whatever.
[397:43.81]Fuck.
[397:44.25]Alright.
[397:47.49]Oh, f*** it.
[397:48.55]Bye.
[397:48.91]Bye, bye, bye.
[397:49.49]I'm not doing this one anymore.
[397:50.87]Fuck this one.
[397:53.77]I ain't doing this shit anymore.
[397:58.84]That level can eat my asshole.
[398:27.25]I'm ordering McChickens right now.
[398:36.86]This dumbass bullshit.
[398:42.62]I'm not gonna say that about Mario.
[398:45.96]He's a really swell... swell gentleman.
[398:47.76]I'm gonna go for like a pee break.
[399:24.99]I'm glad.
[399:26.35]Hey Tickle!
[400:05.61]Oh, I'm getting the chickens.
[400:57.38]I tried to jump off and it didn't work Like I wouldn't just do that guys Stan I wouldn't just do that Fire I
[401:24.52]I'm going to be honest, I did not see these at all.
[401:28.58]They were blended into the background.
[401:31.53]They're hard to go around.
[401:32.61]I can't wait to eat those big chickens.
[401:52.68]All the way to the right.
[401:54.20]All the way to the left.
[401:56.24]Nope.
[401:57.05]Over here?
[401:57.55]Oh my god.
[402:03.07]Yeah, why am I playing as Luigi?
[402:05.89]This is the wrong person to be playing as.
[402:07.91]How do I change this?
[402:12.19]Let me see here.
[402:15.86]Toad.
[402:16.22]I'm going with Toad.
[402:24.09]No, don't die.
[402:25.13]There's no reason to die.
[402:26.48]Take that to the fucking bank and cash it.
[403:08.08]Uh-oh.
[403:11.78]This is- I like this- I like this music.
[403:15.64]Finally, now I'm totally-
[403:54.52]Everybody relax, everything's gonna be just fine.
[403:58.14]I'll be taking you through a journey of... Just words, filler words, because you don't want dead air on stream.
[404:06.44]Filler words so you don't want to have any dead air on stream, okay.
[404:08.82]Toad's not fucking tall enough.
[404:34.85]There's secrets over here?
[404:39.07]God, dude.
[404:40.71]I'm so... Fuck.
[404:46.37]Is this what it looks- is this what seven hours of Mario Maker straight does to you?
[404:53.06]Yeah, I think it does.
[404:54.00]You just have to not be able to perform coherent sentences anymore.
[405:11.00]This level's not bad, no.
[405:12.24]I- I- I've been com- look, complaining for me.
[405:15.22]If you're new to the stream.
[405:17.66]When I complain, it's just- I'm just like coping with the fact that I'm not okay.
[405:24.71]That actually was bullshit.
[405:26.21]It actually was because I got the indicator on my controller that it was being turned off because the battery's low.
[405:32.34]So that is what's hap- that is dog shit.
[405:48.66]Toad's base stats are worse.
[405:54.78]I'm just kidding.
[405:55.40]Bigger turtles are fine.
[405:56.64]I want, like, Big Diaper Toad.
[405:58.14]I thought I could get it.
[406:21.48]I don't know what kind of physics went going on there for that to happen, but whatever.
[406:27.60]Alright, this is where I died last time.
[406:36.20]What's going on here?
[406:36.84]What's over here?
[406:38.52]I don't know.
[406:39.22]Should I go down?
[406:39.86]There's an option.
[406:40.92]I don't think I should go down.
[406:43.54]That's the door.
[406:45.41]And then got a Bowser Jr.
[406:54.42]And two shells appeared out of thin air and killed me instantly.
[407:02.40]Wait, really?
[407:03.12]A Toad Statistics joke?
[407:04.38]What do you mean?
[407:05.14]I didn't say it!
[407:06.48]I was replying!
[407:24.82]Stop!
[407:26.15]I'm already under enough stress out of it Stop it, you're just bullying right now That's so hard to do without having to get hit Thank god it floats back down
[407:56.24]This is McChicken.
[407:57.08]This is a McChicken emergency going on here.
[407:59.64]I just told the guy to come in.
[408:26.56]I said, come in, I'm up, I'm up, I come upstairs.
[408:28.30]He's like, what are you, what's happening, man?
[408:32.36]Come on up here.
[408:33.64]One minute.
[408:47.11]No!
[408:49.69]Alright, I, once these McChickens are here, I'm done.
[408:54.83]I'm actually done.
[408:57.90]I'm gonna make my $20 eating a McChicken on stream, and then I'm going to bed.
[409:04.27]And I'm gonna take a bath.
[409:07.69]A hot bath.
[409:09.31]I'm gonna take a bubble bath.
[409:11.39]When was the last time you guys took a bubble bath?
[409:15.68]I actually thought about it.
[409:22.70]It would be funny to stream me in a huge bubble bath.
[409:26.84]But that's, like, just creepy and fucking weird and odd, and I don't think that's... I don't want to do that.
[409:31.64]I already got... I got the award in 2016 for weirdest person on Twitch award, and, like, I didn't really want it.
[409:38.14]I didn't show up to the ceremony to accept the award either, so...
[409:59.87]Trying to turn over a new leaf and do some different stuff, you know?
[410:11.10]What the f- It comes all the way down and goes- I can feel it.
[410:16.28]I can feel the time.
[410:17.18]The time is rolling into me.
[410:21.23]It's happening.
[410:22.19]It's happening.
[410:27.03]Oh yeah, that's happening.
[410:28.45]I'm out of steam.
[410:29.35]I'm out of gas.
[410:29.79]I'm running on vapors.
[410:34.53]Yeah.
[410:34.93]Oh well.
[410:35.61]It's been fun.
[410:36.61]Yeah, oh yeah, it's been fun.
[410:42.58]Running on vapors.
[410:47.78]We know it's bad when you get calm and quiet.
[410:49.96]Really, it was after... When I did the Mr. Satan thing...
[410:57.99]I was like, I gotta keep it together, but I feel fucking tired.
[411:01.59]It's alright, I'm fine.
[411:03.09]I can go for another hour if I wanted to.
[411:05.48]Alright, finally.
[411:06.10]I did it without losing a mushroom.
[411:28.26]Holy shit, I'm so glad that pixel exists.
[411:31.36]Alright, let's try to get rid of them.
[411:32.42]Let's try this out.
[411:33.84]Come on.
[411:38.49]I'm so... inconsolable about what just happened.
[411:44.41]Because... What the hell?
[411:57.72]Just I tried to jump on his head and I got killed like the dude that shells And then I just bounced into the spikes and then around I don't you know, I don't even know We just got a we just got a dumb like I'm gonna knock on the door funny joke that like
[412:26.80]I'm not running fast enough!
[412:48.77]Fuck off.
[412:51.51]Gimme something.
[412:55.05]What?
[412:55.29]Did I do it?
[412:57.62]I did it.
[412:59.18]That's all it took.
[413:01.98]I can't believe it.
[413:02.86]I didn't think that was what it was going to take.
[413:09.50]What time is it right now?
[413:11.27]Like 1am?
[413:15.75]Eastern?
[413:18.37]I got time.
[413:18.83]I got enough time for the McChickens to show up here.
[413:28.52]Thanks for hanging out, guys.
[413:30.08]Still a lot of people here.
[413:32.36]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[413:33.26]Hope you're having fun.
[413:37.41]I know I am.
[413:40.07]Why did I not blow these up?
[413:44.85]Oh.
[413:46.75]Okay.
[413:47.33]I needed to... This is my favorite stream ever.
[413:54.52]I'm glad you can put up with my bullshit.
[414:04.79]Ding dong.
[414:05.55]Now the question is... He's coming over here.
[414:12.01]Do I need another bomb or something?
[414:19.38]How do I get through that?
[414:23.88]How many McChickens are you getting?
[414:25.00]That's for me to know and you to see.
[414:27.76]Three.
[414:36.80]Um... What am I supposed to do about down there?
[414:42.06]You're doing a 50 McNugget challenge.
[414:47.56]Guys, I'm gonna tell you the story of how friends of mine told me they wanted to do a big McNugget challenge.
[414:52.14]Or actually, it was a Wendy's chicken nugget challenge.
[414:55.34]And they talked it up for a couple hours.
[414:59.52]Sitting around, just hanging out.
[415:02.67]Hey, yeah, who's gonna go get them?
[415:04.27]Nah, like, I don't wanna go get them.
[415:06.97]So I was like, this is gonna be fucking hilarious.
[415:09.15]You guys, I'll go get them.
[415:12.25]So they wanted 50 Wendy's nuggets, and they were gonna have a contest.
[415:15.37]Who could eat them fastest and shit.
[415:18.25]So I went all the way to Wendy's and I got all these nuggets and it was like a stupid order.
[415:21.87]The person was like, how many do you want?
[415:23.21]50?
[415:24.01]Oh, okay.
[415:25.19]Like, dick?
[415:26.21]Fine.
[415:26.68]Okay, sure.
[415:27.34]Like, this is like a comedy order.
[415:29.88]So I did it.
[415:30.96]And I probably should have known.
[415:32.20]There was like six people that I was getting these nuggets for.
[415:34.72]How do you do a contest with six people and 50 nuggets?
[415:37.35]That doesn't make any sense.
[415:38.75]You would need like 200.
[415:40.23]For like six to eight people.
[415:42.33]So I bought them.
[415:42.97]I eventually got the guy to give them to me.
[415:44.57]Went back to the dude's house that we were hanging out at.
[415:48.13]And they're like, alright, here they are.
[415:50.02]Let's open them up.
[415:50.58]And they got them all ready.
[415:51.82]And they put them on a plate.
[415:53.18]And then they just started eating them normally.
[415:55.54]And it was just a lie.
[415:56.62]They just wanted me to go get them a bunch of chicken nuggets.
[415:58.88]And that was the way they were going to get me to do it.
[416:01.02]Because I was so psyched for them to do this.
[416:07.53]They were eating them incredibly slowly in front of me.
[416:13.14]So I was the asshole that went and got 50 nuggets.
[416:17.52]And speaking of, um... Nothing that we were talking about.
[416:25.76]What am I supposed to do here?
[416:29.32]Can I... I don't think I can make a jump.
[416:30.88]Can I jump up over this?
[416:33.28]No.
[416:33.86]It's gonna kill me.
[416:36.88]Eight nugget challenge.
[416:38.04]Yeah, that wouldn't make any sense.
[416:48.47]Bucket challenges.
[416:49.13]I want to give you a break.
[416:49.92]I didn't know they were coming out that fast.
[417:14.86]Alright, now... One, two, three, four, five.
[417:21.07]They just spam out.
[417:26.55]Okay.
[417:30.39]That's a fucked up jump.
[417:45.33]Oh, man.
[417:54.78]No.
[417:59.80]Only on a Jerma stream would I feel bad about chicken nuggets.
[418:02.72]Well, I mean, it was... It was kind of funny.
[418:10.81]I was a little irritated.
[418:13.51]Because I thought I was going to show.
[418:23.24]It was mildly irritating.
[418:24.42]I'll have to... I'll have to lob on this.
[418:32.09]Hmm...
[418:50.21]I don't know what is the point here.
[418:53.58]I don't see any block to hit or anything.
[418:59.60]This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[419:03.78]Is it gonna be safe?
[419:22.68]I'm gonna go the other way.
[419:23.38]Let's check an update?
[419:26.36]Uh, it'll be here soon.
[419:32.24]Okay.
[419:34.08]Now what is... That drops you in there.
[419:36.12]I can climb across this.
[419:38.86]Right?
[419:40.94]Somebody yell at me if I'm wrong.
[419:42.82]I think I can, though.
[419:55.65]I keep forgetting that the thing has a hitbox five feet It's not that big of a deal I got it Oh
[420:40.81]I just effectively waited for the train by standing on the tracks.
[420:49.30]Not gonna be in my best interest.
[420:59.52]Quickly, quickly!
[421:00.18]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[421:19.73]Just like that.
[421:20.39]Same deal.
[421:22.35]Is this a Nintendo-made level?
[421:23.83]I don't think so.
[421:29.52]I think there was an avatar on it.
[421:46.64]Please feed your guild members and stream legends.
[421:49.56]Not yet.
[421:50.62]I will very soon though.
[421:51.74]Alright, so should I not?
[421:55.14]Is that just a bad idea?
[421:56.40]Should I just go backwards or something?
[422:01.41]Because now...
[422:21.83]I'm not going to be able to make it over here.
[422:34.78]Ground pound?
[422:35.52]There's no ground pound in this one.
[422:39.26]Oh, I need to get under there and just wait then?
[422:54.42]You gotta hit the switch twice.
[422:56.83]Hmm.
[422:57.95]I'm gonna get three more lives.
[423:00.67]Before I'm gonna do like a McChicken IV.
[423:29.10]Let's go.
[423:33.53]Here we go.
[423:39.09]Going through Diamond City.
[423:40.85]Here we go.
[423:55.39]Fall down.
[423:55.93]Boink!
[423:58.17]Boink, boink!
[424:00.03]Got it.
[424:02.15]Alright, now... What's the deal now?
[424:07.03]Keep this on?
[424:08.49]That means like, oh yeah, now I can go this way.
[424:14.72]Figured it out.
[424:16.00]And there's a checkpoint.
[424:17.42]And there's a... Alright.
[424:21.21]Gotta hit all three POWs.
[424:22.45]One.
[424:22.65]Two.
[424:23.63]One.
[424:24.49]Two.
[424:42.90]It shouldn't be too bad.
[424:49.27]I'm gonna go now.
[424:51.31]Wait.
[424:54.37]Oh, shit.
[424:55.29]Alright.
[424:56.15]The last one is... I guess I gotta jump over it.
[425:04.23]No, that would be bad.
[425:07.77]Why did I not get this?
[425:08.61]I only have one more.
[425:09.83]This is my last guy.
[425:11.23]Why did I not... I shouldn't have fallen off that.
[425:35.63]I should have been able to stand on it.
[425:42.21]I'm gonna have to run with it.
[425:47.18]Uh, maybe.
[425:47.98]I'm so timid.
[425:50.04]It's bad.
[425:51.02]Okay.
[425:51.58]Just get up there.
[425:52.28]That's it.
[426:08.42]Now it goes down here.
[426:13.74]Grab this brim.
[426:23.46]And then just get it up there.
[426:25.52]Wait, but... Oh, I'm psyched.
[426:30.12]Fuck.
[426:32.30]Oh, I almost died.
[426:35.20]That was so close.
[426:36.13]That was inches.
[426:42.54]This is the end.
[426:43.20]This is my last shot to get through here.
[426:49.42]So I gotta go get the first one, somehow climb that vine and start screwing to the right.
[427:16.06]Well, is there a pixel that's gonna touch me if I stand here?
[427:22.55]I don't know, is it gonna hurt me?
[427:31.50]I almost blew it.
[427:40.36]Is that it?
[427:46.45]No!
[427:47.15]I... I tried and I hit my head.
[427:49.93]Oh, it's just the one jump but like I just bumped the heads because it's... it's... it's... you have to be perfect to get up there.
[428:09.20]Oh, no.
[428:09.38]Oh...
[428:20.01]I'm just hanging out.
[428:20.69]I'll be back here for a little while.
[428:23.37]I'm gonna be hanging out back here.
[428:25.89]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[428:26.75]Just gonna be chilling back here.
[428:32.55]You're gonna need me again.
[428:43.18]You know, what if I'm...
[428:50.29]This one's gonna be a treat.
[429:03.14]You just threw me off right there.
[429:04.38]You don't need to tell me to watch out for my surroundings, to not throw my Wiimote into my fucking fridge, okay?
[429:10.04]I know.
[429:10.66]You don't.
[429:11.12]Why do you have to keep telling me this?
[429:16.95]I promise I'm not going to swing and hit my little brother in the head.
[429:20.63]I'm going to be sure.
[429:43.23]You made that same joke on the main channel years ago?
[429:46.51]It's been a long enough time, I can reason.
[429:48.51]Did I not touch the top?
[430:05.02]Damn it.
[430:07.26]It didn't touch the top either.
[430:33.68]You know, it... The screen that tells you to collect the coins, I wish would just get out of the way.
[430:42.23]This shit's just in the way.
[430:50.25]I wonder what I have to do for this level.
[430:52.43]It's not like Nintendo's told me three times before I get to play the game.
[431:28.85]This one looks alright.
[432:07.53]Why am I doing super expert?
[432:08.83]Because... I am a maniac.
[432:32.52]Expert is just as hard, except the hot garbage is rarer.
[432:38.66]Yeah, what even classifies super expert?
[432:41.00]Oh, I screwed that up.
[432:43.62]Let's see if I can do this one.
[432:45.32]Come on, I can do it.
[432:54.77]What?
[432:55.25]Oh.
[433:04.55]I forgot about...
[433:44.05]Thought I could go through, that I could jump through it.
[433:48.43]Is my mic broken?
[433:49.31]No, I'm just trying to concentrate.
[433:50.49]I'm just sitting here staring with my eyes wide open.
[434:00.43]Why am I turning around to hit the springs?
[434:02.23]You actually won't beat this, because one guy said that.
[434:04.69]I'm gonna go for it.
[434:32.27]You bet the Uber Eats guy could beat this.
[434:33.93]I bet she... bet she couldn't.
[434:48.14]Well, you know, dude, I'm like so concerned with like the three people out of like 4,000 that'll tell me, what, you're not playing super expert?
[434:56.48]What, you suck, you fucking idiot.
[434:58.94]Then I'm like, I can do it.
[435:00.92]I'm capable.
[435:01.74]I'm so concerned about like the five people that would come here and be like, oh, this is dumb.
[435:15.87]No, I'm not.
[435:16.37]I'm not dumb.
[435:17.90]I can do super expert, watch.
[435:20.42]Oops, oops, oops.
[435:23.74]Those people are already gone.
[435:24.96]They left like five hours ago.
[435:26.60]No, you gotta go fast, you can't just stop.
[435:55.51]Don't forget it again!
[435:58.23]It's just too much to think about.
[436:05.46]Oh, it's alright, whatever.
[436:06.88]Where are those chicken sandwiches?
[436:08.88]Why does it take so long?
[436:12.20]Did I send this person into a giant drive-thru line?
[436:16.35]That's even worse.
[436:17.41]I'm even more of a bad person.
[436:20.68]This person might be sitting in like a 12-car drive-through line with three McChickens.
[436:33.36]Guess what he did again.
[436:34.20]Guess what he did.
[436:35.14]Guess what he did.
[436:36.29]You can rewind if you want to make sure if you know what he did.
[436:39.21]He didn't do the thing where he knocked this thing down again.
[436:44.46]He's not capable of doing this, I think.
[436:46.74]And what probably should happen is he should probably go back to simple things.
[436:51.54]like counting to 10, or choosing what shape a shape looks like, like circles, squares, you can do those.
[437:00.25]We're not sure what else he's capable of doing.
[437:36.87]Alright, give me some fun levels.
[437:37.91]Alright, I'm done.
[437:38.71]No more of this.
[437:39.35]No more of this.
[437:39.77]Let's do fun view levels with people that are viewer levels, you know?
[437:43.23]I'm not... No, no, no, no.
[437:44.27]I can do... Let's just play... This is fun.
[437:46.77]Let's do this again.
[437:47.85]Give me one.
[437:50.99]Alright, I know for a fact that I'm positive that you just put horse cock there.
[437:55.81]So, funny.
[437:57.27]But you were the first one, so... Nice.
[438:02.98]Good.
[438:03.60]Good.
[438:11.68]This one is easy.
[438:12.64]I don't think I believe you, though.
[438:13.86]That's the thing.
[438:15.64]I don't believe a word you're saying right now.
[438:20.61]Let's see, I can't wait for everyone to do like the Pepe fucking like... I can't wait for everyone to do the Pepe like... Why?
[438:46.20]Now, everybody knows that the Pepe laugh is that, like... It's the dog from Dick Dastardly.
[438:53.81]Kanye.
[438:54.43]Kanye of wisdom.
[438:56.63]Okay, I'll try it.
[439:13.77]Okay.
[439:42.88]Oh, what's this?
[439:43.56]What is this thing?
[439:44.80]What is this?
[439:47.48]This looks like we sat on it.
[439:51.02]Did the delivery guy?
[439:53.98]Was he mad?
[439:55.96]Did he sit on this shit?
[439:57.08]Like, after, yeah, I'll show here, I'll show this fucking asshole making me wait for big chickens, like, stuffing under his ass?
[440:24.98]Did somebody sit on this?
[440:27.00]Why is that lettuce on here?
[440:32.80]I'm going to make $20 right now.
[440:37.18]What's on this?
[440:41.47]Do you see what happened?
[440:42.45]Let me show you this.
[440:44.39]Look at this.
[440:45.33]This is a piece of lettuce.
[440:47.89]This is not.
[440:48.71]I promise.
[440:49.33]It might look like I ripped off a piece of tissue paper.
[440:52.05]This is lettuce.
[440:54.30]And let's see how it tastes.
[441:03.97]Very bad.
[441:07.91]Desynced?
[441:10.09]It shouldn't be desynced.
[441:11.49]Oh, I'll fix that.
[441:12.37]Don't worry.
[441:12.85]I'm not going to eat it until it's synced up.
[441:15.40]Trust me.
[441:18.32]What, do you think I'm crazy?
[441:23.75]We should be synced up.
[441:28.33]See if you can hear the bite.
[441:32.40]React more.
[441:33.02]What do you mean react?
[441:34.34]It's a McChicken sandwich.
[441:35.36]I just showed you the... React more.
[441:45.24]I'm about to eat.
[441:46.40]Why am I doing this?
[442:01.17]Where's my 20 fucking bucks?
[442:15.00]Somebody said shoe 20 times.
[442:22.80]I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[442:28.94]I'll try.
[442:29.34]I don't think I've chewed 20 times in my whole life.
[442:31.78]You're supposed to chew 20 times, right?
[442:36.66]That's not possible.
[442:37.82]It just turns into like gush.
[442:54.66]It's not enough.
[442:56.16]That wasn't enough.
[443:13.44]Your hair.
[443:14.12]You guys are fucked.
[443:28.05]You're making this not as enjoyable as it should be.
[443:45.59]No, no, no.
[444:15.05]I'm not 33.
[444:16.00]I am.
[444:22.50]Hey, look.
[444:23.14]You get one life to be 33 and have fun.
[444:28.08]I choose this life.
[444:29.32]This is the life that I choose.
[444:33.09]I choose this, okay?
[444:47.32]That's a bad choice.
[444:50.55]This is a midlife crisis on stream.
[444:52.61]I'm doing just fine.
[445:06.46]Oh, that's so funny.
[445:08.56]Look, now I feel like I'm going to beat this level first try.
[445:11.95]If I don't beat this level first try, I... No, that's a bad idea.
[445:15.55]I was going to say I was going to eat the McChicken in less than 10 seconds.
[445:30.80]Okay.
[445:34.36]This bag of McDonald's is so huge.
[445:36.76]What's even in here?
[445:38.40]Why are there bacon fries in here?
[445:40.54]Is that a new item?
[445:43.93]New item revealed!
[445:47.27]What?
[445:48.01]What the hell are these?
[445:49.69]Oh, these are the saddest, disgusting... Look at these.
[445:52.59]Look at how awful this looks.
[445:55.59]Look at this.
[445:56.17]Look at... I have no... There's no connection here between me and McDonald's.
[446:00.13]This is a pure opinion and a review of this item.
[446:03.12]Look at how shitty these look.
[446:05.64]Cheesy bacon fries.
[446:06.91]You ready for this?
[446:15.03]That looks like somebody just blew a bloody snot rocket into fries.
[446:19.15]Is it chili?
[446:23.95]It's just right in the middle.
[446:24.91]It's like an ice cream scoop of like bacon chili.
[446:28.69]You need a better picture of this.
[446:29.76]This is terrible.
[446:33.11]That's not, that's a joke.
[446:35.31]Let's see how they taste.
[446:41.51]Grocery store easy cheese out of the can.
[446:51.92]Wouldn't order again.
[446:56.02]No, wouldn't order again.
[446:58.70]That's been the review for the McDonald's bacon fries.
[447:01.96]Wouldn't order them again.
[447:03.20]Put them in your nose?
[447:04.36]You think that would... No.
[447:06.16]Alright, I... Again, we're just like dicking around and being... Like, you know, we're... You know, they notice that streamers do that shit.
[447:12.83]Oh, we're... Like, we're doing something stupid here.
[447:14.75]Like, oh, you know, we're just having fun here.
[447:16.07]Like, I'm doing this.
[447:17.31]I'm being a fucking weirdo.
[447:19.21]You guys are just like watching and pointing at the screen and laughing at me.
[447:23.37]You know, like, oh, we're like doing this.
[447:27.57]No, we're not.
[447:30.89]It's me.
[447:34.90]Yeah, these are... Somebody get McDonald's on the line, man, because holy shit, these are fucking not worthy.
[447:41.02]These are bad.
[447:45.18]Did you hear that?
[447:58.35]I'm done playing games.
[448:00.27]I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna go to IRL and eat.
[448:07.03]I wonder if the viewers will go up.
[448:10.17]Watch me at like 6k.
[448:12.24]Just sitting here eating like shitty ground bacon fries.
[448:25.38]Don't ever lick your hands like that.
[448:26.45]You've been touching things.
[448:29.94]Okay.
[448:31.70]Well, that's it for Mario Maker, guys.
[448:32.88]It was fun.
[448:33.52]It was.
[448:34.42]Thanks for the levels.
[448:35.10]Thanks for participating.
[448:36.04]And if you gave me one, most of them were really, really good.
[448:39.60]All of them were good.
[448:46.33]I can hit it big in the IRL section.
[448:50.35]Okay, this is how you know I've kind of lost my fucking mind.
[448:54.57]I was about to put this in here.
[448:57.34]I was about to put the straw in here.
[448:59.52]For some reason.
[449:02.52]Have I been poisoned?
[449:03.76]I don't understand.
[449:04.48]There we go.
[449:06.48]Nobody drinks this much soda.
[449:09.34]There's another thing.
[449:10.19]Who the fuck is gonna drink this?
[449:12.75]This is like 66 ounces of liquid.
[449:16.89]This is like five times your sugar content for the day.
[449:20.39]This is not alright.
[449:21.27]I had something with solid in there.
[449:30.21]Alright, I gotta change the directory.
[449:35.84]I'm so self-conscious of eating on stream.
[449:37.50]I fucking... I don't like this.
[449:39.66]I know people hate this.
[449:41.34]I'm really sorry that you have to be subjected to this.
[449:44.64]Hold on.
[449:48.08]I'm going to social eating.
[449:58.81]How about, um, what should the title be?
[450:00.17]McDonald's Review.
[450:04.79]I'm gonna do two out of five stars.
[450:11.07]No, how about two out of five so far?
[450:17.59]What do you mean so far?
[450:24.33]Food and drink?
[450:29.45]Click the picture.
[450:30.22]What picture?
[450:34.24]Oh, God.
[450:35.62]The fucking internet, man.
[450:36.58]The guy.
[450:42.10]The guy.
[450:43.04]I thought that said the guy that delivered your big chickens gave you a Mario Maker level.
[450:50.13]Hey, man.
[450:51.67]Hope you like the food.
[450:53.71]Check out my level.
[451:02.46]What else is in here?
[451:08.22]This is McChicken number two.
[451:09.96]This is really weird, and... I gotta apologize to people that have been watching this channel for a long time.
[451:16.51]This is weird.
[451:18.01]And... How am I desynced again?
[451:28.83]That doesn't make any sense.
[451:36.55]This is not even that weird.
[451:37.47]People do this shit every day.
[451:40.76]People do what I'm doing right now every day.
[451:44.90]Every day.
[451:47.65]This is not even weird.
[451:48.35]This is like normal for Twitch.
[451:49.99]Isn't it?
[452:08.33]I'm killing all these things.
[452:11.33]This should be fixed.
[452:14.27]If I could make the webcam a little smaller.
[452:16.17]I don't like people looking at me.
[452:22.82]There.
[452:23.14]Are we better?
[452:24.20]We should be fine.
[452:25.98]He's actually eating two.
[452:27.10]I'm going to eat three.
[452:30.08]I've got three.
[452:30.86]Is this what people do?
[452:34.56]They just eat and collect money?
[452:36.39]No.
[452:37.75]No.
[452:42.70]Vilemi just gave... Wait a minute.
[452:55.60]I'm not going to eat and I'm not going to chew and talk to you.
[452:57.96]That's rude.
[452:59.52]Vilemi just gave a bunch of community subs.
[453:05.11]Vilemi also gave $25 right here and said, I can't believe faked eating the sandwich too.
[453:11.01]Why is this one going to have lettuce on it?
[453:15.94]I wish I didn't look at that.
[453:19.99]This one has... No, this does have lettuce on it.
[453:23.79]It's like wood chips.
[453:25.01]That's the lettuce.
[453:26.83]McDonald's.
[453:27.91]What's going on here?
[453:30.73]Pre-recorded McChicken.
[453:32.67]Make me do something.
[453:33.25]I'll do it.
[453:37.18]What's the flavor?
[453:37.72]Oh, yeah.
[453:37.94]I'm supposed to be reviewing this.
[453:38.84]Okay, so we've got... The initial bite goes right through.
[453:45.42]it's hard because I'm missing like nine teeth so when I get it back here it's I'm missing every molar so I have to like gum it like so once I get the initial bite down there okay these are spicy mcchickens
[454:16.18]I don't know why, but every single time that I have ordered a McChicken in the last six months, they've just given me a spicy McChicken.
[454:29.55]Have they run out?
[454:30.19]Did McDonald's run out of regular McChickens and they're just trying to pass it as not?
[454:36.17]I don't get it.
[454:38.18]Show your feet are pre-recorded.
[454:40.60]I would rather you think this is pre-recorded.
[454:56.03]I'm trying to click this link, but chat is moving so fast.
[454:58.53]Oh my god.
[455:06.83]You know some streams that you just look back and you say, I kind of regret all the things I did over the last 40 minutes?
[455:13.12]This is one of them.
[455:25.33]Just leave this up.
[455:31.19]There are spicy McChickens?
[455:32.37]Yeah.
[455:45.76]Fucking dinosaur, man.
[455:48.20]Like Barney Rubble.
[456:02.18]That's what your hands look like in a cartoon when Tom and Jerry come over and smash him with a hammer.
[456:08.30]Oh, I got something gross here.
[456:10.84]Yeah, good thing the camera's not on because I just bit into a solid chunk.
[456:14.63]I just bit into a bone.
[456:15.87]Mm-hmm.
[456:24.27]That was a bone.
[456:26.49]Oh, there's more bones in here.
[456:28.41]I don't know.
[456:29.63]Something's in here.
[456:30.47]Something fucked up's in here.
[456:32.23]Quick, get this on screen.
[456:34.49]Mm-mm.
[456:35.16]Something fucked up in there.
[456:45.52]I don't know what that was.
[456:46.16]It was weird.
[456:55.29]Fingernail, don't say that.
[456:57.28]I'm not saying that.
[456:58.88]Look, I wanted this.
[457:00.33]I love McChickens.
[457:01.61]They're my favorite.
[458:01.23]I look like the brain.
[458:02.77]Are you talking about Krang?
[458:22.86]Don't say that when I'm eating it, I'll laugh.
[458:27.67]Oh my god.
[458:30.18]Invert the other picture.
[458:41.52]It's like, who's, okay, who's reacting to who here?
[458:46.17]Which one of us is reacting?
[458:49.57]I don't know who's the reactor.
[458:51.49]Who's stream, what video is this?
[458:59.27]It's the council.
[459:03.27]I'm not going to lie.
[459:04.31]I heard, I swear to God, I heard from inside of this can.
[459:08.92]I heard a, there was sitting still on this desk.
[459:14.54]I heard a, like a bubble coming up and popping up here.
[459:18.98]Like there's a fucking animal in here.
[459:42.67]we got hold up we also got something else from it what is okay so we've also got I don't think I'm gonna be able to eat this don't worry you got it you got it I got it with the meal I'm gonna it's gonna be delicious anyways okay so um
[460:11.91]This is a... No, I promise you that's not a picture of a salad.
[460:16.65]That's a salad.
[460:20.37]That's not a decorated plate.
[460:22.23]That's a salad.
[460:30.24]I'm not going to eat this salad.
[460:31.28]I'm not going to eat this salad.
[460:34.02]Here's the review.
[460:35.62]Alright, review time.
[460:37.20]I've got to eat one more to find out.
[460:38.92]I've got to get one more in me.
[460:44.43]How's this one look?
[460:46.33]Let's actually unwrap this one.
[461:03.52]Well, as we can see from the unwrapping, somebody stomped on this.
[461:16.09]This one's better.
[461:17.31]This one's... Mm.
[461:17.95]Mm-hmm.
[461:20.14]What?
[461:21.96]This one's a little better.
[461:27.08]Fresher.
[461:27.40]A little more zing to it.
[461:31.69]Although it kind of does have... Little... Something like the lettuce is trying to get out and escape from out of the bun.
[461:41.17]Like as you see, the lettuce is trying to essentially get out.
[461:44.34]It's crawling out to try to leave.
[461:48.44]Sorry.
[461:56.67]Let me front page.
[461:58.85]Twitch didn't front page me right now.
[462:00.27]That would be a mistake.
[462:08.96]No, that's not real.
[462:18.07]You guys with these pictures, I swear.
[462:19.95]This does not even mean eating a hamburger.
[462:30.11]This is just like an old man.
[462:34.55]Where is it?
[462:37.32]No, that's not it.
[462:40.58]This is just like a regular picture of my profile and my gross beard.
[462:43.50]I don't know what that's... I just saved it.
[462:45.24]Where'd it go?
[462:56.54]Alright, this is like... Hold on.
[462:59.73]Where is it?
[463:00.93]I'm just realizing this right now.
[463:05.39]These are the images that you see back to back next to each other for...
[463:11.44]like the hair transplant commercials.
[463:16.04]You know what I'm saying?
[463:22.69]And I do a voiceover talking about, hey, you know, I'm telling you, it's my hair.
[463:26.85]It's my hair.
[463:28.11]I can do this.
[463:30.39]You know?
[463:32.89]I can go swimming with this.
[463:35.43]I can do this now.
[463:37.00]And they like go like that.
[463:43.33]Great.
[463:45.42]Put it in your hair is now a thing.
[463:48.22]Oh, I'm gonna take a bath tonight.
[463:49.54]Alright, get the shit out of here.
[464:06.64]Where's the picture I'm looking for?
[464:17.27]Now, this is going to sound crazy.
[464:20.36]But that looks identical, and I mean identical, to my grandmother.
[464:28.42]Identical.
[464:33.79]If I had a picture of my grandmother, you would say, holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[464:51.54]Why did the stream turn into this?
[464:52.50]Because somebody said they would pay me $20 if I... I'm not going to put this one on stream.
[464:56.42]Somebody said they were going to give me $20 if I ate a McChicken, so I'm eating three because I'm hungry.
[465:16.76]Guys.
[465:21.20]Oh, man.
[465:32.38]Where is it?
[465:32.90]I just saved it.
[465:34.32]This is just scary.
[465:37.13]This is a scary picture.
[465:40.23]That's scary.
[465:47.23]What is this, like, Earth, wind, fire, and water?
[465:50.22]Why do I have all these on the screen?
[466:06.29]There was this lady, and her name was Brady, and she had a house with a bunch of fucking kids.
[466:14.53]And they all were a big, big family.
[466:17.07]And they got in fights and shit.
[466:31.54]Until the one day when this lady met this fellow.
[466:37.01]And they knew that they were eating chicken bones.
[466:39.59]Because that's what I just fucking ate again.
[466:40.89]I better not.
[466:50.22]I swear to God, man.
[466:51.36]I'm not trying to be mean about this.
[466:52.92]Hold on.
[467:05.07]Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[467:06.15]Wait a minute.
[467:07.53]Wait a minute.
[467:08.27]Everybody calm.
[467:09.02]Everybody calm.
[467:10.44]Everybody calm the fuck down.
[467:13.48]I got it.
[467:14.12]I'm doing it.
[467:17.32]Everybody relax.
[467:18.08]I got it.
[467:18.42]I got this under control.
[467:20.77]Hold on.
[467:30.43]Wait a minute.
[467:30.93]Wait a minute.
[467:33.50]You just wait right there.
[467:42.60]Hold that thought.
[468:11.46]Here's the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls.
[468:19.34]All of them had hair of gold, like their mother, the youngest one in curls.
[468:26.83]It's the story of a man named Brady.
[468:30.60]Who was busy with three boys of his own They were four men living all together Yet they were all alone Till the one day when the lady met this fellow And they knew that it was much more than a hunt That this group must somehow form a family
[468:52.56]That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.
[468:55.78]The Brady Bunch.
[468:58.20]The Brady Bunch.
[469:00.37]That's the way we became the Brady Bunch.
[469:35.98]Did I show you that I've been fucking going back to the gym in my dreams?
[469:53.81]Alright, does anybody want these?
[469:56.89]Anybody want these fucking disgusting things?
[470:01.34]Anybody want a decorated plate salad?
[470:03.81]I have to try it.
[470:04.71]This is a review.
[470:05.39]Three... Two out of... It's probably two out of ten, to be honest.
[470:17.69]Oh, it's burning my eyes.
[470:22.60]I can't... That's not a joke.
[470:23.46]I can't do that.
[470:27.06]I can't fucking do that.
[470:28.04]This is a comedy!
[470:34.65]Actually, hold on a second here.
[470:40.97]Hold on a minute here.
[470:47.38]Whoa.
[470:51.48]Whoa, hold on.
[470:59.78]This is not bad.
[471:01.12]This is actually pretty fucking good.
[471:03.68]This is actually a pretty... I think there's somebody... Alright.
[471:10.15]This is supposed to be carrots, I think.
[471:12.27]Let me show you this.
[471:13.69]Pretty good.
[471:14.35]Not bad, but let's look at the... I don't know what these are.
[471:17.51]I don't even know if these are edible.
[471:19.51]Are these Cheez-Its?
[471:22.18]What are these?
[471:25.74]What are those?
[471:34.16]Nope.
[471:39.39]No, that's horrible.
[471:49.40]It's a carrot.
[471:50.12]It's a shaved carrot.
[471:58.58]Not very... It's not bad.
[472:01.14]It's actually pretty good.
[472:02.76]I don't do dressing on my salad.
[472:04.46]I eat it like a fucking rabbit.
[472:11.92]So, uh, question.
[472:12.68]I don't know if I was making a joke.
[472:15.79]I did.
[472:16.17]We went up in viewers.
[472:16.91]We did.
[472:17.83]Okay.
[472:19.23]This is what you want.
[472:19.87]This is what you're gonna get.
[472:21.13]This is the thing that you asked for.
[472:22.03]This is the thing you're gonna get.
[472:24.87]Okay.
[472:25.59]Fine.
[472:29.75]You can do the whole salad in your mouth at the same time.
[472:35.57]No.
[472:39.93]I'm not doing that.
[472:44.11]Fork or riot?
[472:44.97]Who goes to McDonald's and gets a fork?
[472:47.57]They don't just hand them out.
[472:50.77]They don't just hand out those forks.
[472:53.51]And what you're going to do is you're going to add two parts of Parmesan cheese.
[472:58.84]Ster it up inside of that bowl.
[473:04.37]Chef John?
[473:05.85]Chef John from foodwishes.com?
[473:11.55]Where did you come from?
[473:12.35]I don't know if I want to eat one of these Reese's eggs.
[473:35.77]surprisingly tangy so I'm I think I'm done I think I'm I think I'm gonna go to bed watch if I saw your face in real life I would laugh
[474:07.90]what does that mean this is real this isn't but this is not real life how is this you can laugh now salad dressing in here and using a shampoo like just like condition it in there
[474:38.48]That's not going to happen.
[474:42.08]Come on, guys.
[474:43.02]Come on.
[474:47.76]This is not IRL.
[474:48.38]This is food and drink.
[474:49.24]But isn't that the same subcategory, isn't it?
[474:54.94]Drink the dressing.
[474:55.70]I don't like dressing.
[474:58.26]I'm one of those weird vampire people that doesn't put dressing on their salads.
[475:10.65]He thought about it.
[475:12.45]I don't like dressing in clothes.
[475:13.83]I like dressing in clothes.
[475:17.03]Are we going to see the McChicken and the Jerma rumble?
[475:22.04]No.
[475:24.80]Dressing is gross.
[475:25.44]You're not weird.
[475:25.94]Well, thank you.
[475:26.82]Thank you for saying that.
[475:31.45]Alright.
[475:31.75]I'm going to cap this up.
[475:34.76]Final review.
[475:35.92]So it was 2 out of 5 so far.
[475:37.16]I'm going to give it a 3.
[475:38.30]No, I'm going to give it a 2.8 out of 5.
[475:41.70]And the only reason why I'm doing that is because if we start at 5, these french fries actually, they could have come out of the trash.
[475:52.84]Like I'm just being, that's a review.
[475:55.30]That's not me, like that's a review.
[475:57.76]That's my opinion of what that is.
[476:01.30]The salad's actually pretty good.
[476:02.68]If you got a McDonald's salad,
[476:05.94]You'd probably think it was alright.
[476:08.56]So... But that brought it down like a whole letter grade.
[476:13.95]The McChickens tasted really good.
[476:15.89]Except there was bones in them.
[476:17.01]Like two of them had these weird chewy calluses in them.
[476:20.89]So that brings it down another letter grade.
[476:22.31]But they still tasted good.
[476:24.62]McChickens are amazing.
[476:25.82]2.8.
[476:29.60]I think I got a 5.
[476:38.69]I'll see you tomorrow.
[476:39.63]I'm out of here.
[476:40.29]I'm going home.
[476:40.91]I'm going home.
[476:41.71]I'm going home.
[476:42.93]I'm going... I gotta go home.
[476:48.28]That one just tasted like it came right out of the ground.
[476:50.30]Does that mean it's fresh?
[476:51.12]If it was like dirt?
[476:54.26]If you taste dirt, does that mean it's fresh and it came out of the ground?
[477:09.45]If you saw a guy in the subway eating like this, you'd move like four chairs to the right.
[477:18.12]Guy's eating a salad with his fucking hands.
[477:19.82]And no dressing.
[477:22.44]Whoa.
[477:23.18]Bye.
[477:24.52]I'm going to stand and hold on to the thing.
[477:26.26]I'm going to stand.
[477:26.82]I'm not going to sit next to this person.
[477:31.70]This is the subway of Twitch.
[477:32.90]Yeah, it kind of is.
[477:33.54]Alright.
[477:36.55]I've got my greens.
[477:38.98]I'm like smoking a cigarette here.
[477:47.22]Sweat check.
[477:47.78]I'm not doing that because I've got big hair under my arms and that would be embarrassing and everyone would laugh at me, so I'm not doing that.
[478:08.28]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[478:09.42]I'll see you tomorrow.
[478:18.45]This is not even... This is Dr. Pepper.
[478:22.05]It's pretty good.
[478:25.81]Mario Maker is a ton of fun.
[478:27.55]I have, uh... I lost my mind a few times, but... Still an amazing, fun, awesome experience.
[478:32.74]Everybody making levels.
[478:34.52]Your creativity is fucking pretty sick.
[478:40.53]I wouldn't classify this as a meltdown stream.
[478:42.51]This was a positive meltdown.
[478:43.87]There's two different meltdowns.
[478:45.51]There's like positive meltdown and there's negative meltdown.
[478:48.51]You can go up.
[478:49.09]You can have an upwards meltdown.
[478:53.36]There's a meltup, yeah.
[478:59.18]I still was having fun.
[479:02.67]Yeah, that was a meltup.
[479:03.53]That's fine.
[479:05.21]But let's go back.
[479:05.75]We're going to do the bits and we're going to do the subs too.
[479:11.57]I've been sure for eight hours.
[479:12.71]What the hell happened?
[479:14.75]How did we get this far?
[479:20.19]Well, alright.
[479:21.69]Eight hours.
[479:25.78]Anywho, let's go back.
[479:26.62]We had $3.50 from Origian.
[479:27.52]Jerma, I hear you're angry.
[479:28.34]Have your baby bottled.
[479:36.60]It's right here.
[479:37.40]I shouldn't be drinking soda this late.
[479:39.20]It's 11 o'clock at night Pacific.
[479:41.88]I gotta, like, go to bed.
[479:42.68]Time flies when you're having fun.
[479:46.49]Yeah, it does.
[479:48.93]This was a fun one.
[479:49.61]I had a great time.
[479:52.33]Sauce Bird.
[479:53.59]Thank you, Sauce Bird, for the three bucks.
[479:55.95]Ring-a-ding-ding, banana phone.
[479:57.83]Oh shit, you read this.
[479:59.41]A while ago, you did a Larry David impression for me, and I want to thank you for doing that.
[480:02.83]I thought it was great.
[480:04.06]I do have another request, if you are willing to try.
[480:06.60]Can you do Larry David annoyed, like he's telling people to go away?
[480:09.98]I think... What?
[480:17.50]Get away from me!
[480:18.24]Get away from me!
[480:18.90]Get away from me!
[480:22.21]You're a fucking idiot!
[480:24.05]You're crazy!
[480:24.73]You're crazy!
[480:25.71]You're crazy!
[480:39.36]Fucking nailed it!
[480:47.88]Thank you, Saucebird, for the three bucks.
[480:55.68]Terrible in all caps.
[480:57.04]I don't know what this is doing.
[481:14.19]Why is it doing that?
[481:17.50]It's fucking boiling.
[481:18.12]There's something in here.
[481:23.58]Thank you, C4G, for the 250.
[481:25.12]Hi, Jerma.
[481:29.80]I run the bot counting the +2, -2 score in chat.
[481:32.40]Didn't catch the Space Engine stream, but my friend linked me a clip afterward of you saying that seeing the total in chat made you self-conscious.
[481:39.17]Didn't occur to me that having your stream quantified like that would be stressful, and I'm sorry.
[481:43.53]I've turned it off.
[481:44.25]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[481:45.05]I was just messing around.
[481:48.87]No, don't worry about that.
[481:51.84]I'm just kidding around.
[481:53.74]It's funny.
[481:56.52]That's why it's gone.
[481:59.48]No, it's okay.
[482:00.02]It's fine.
[482:00.68]I'm mainly messing around.
[482:02.22]Don't worry.
[482:06.76]It was up by 2,500 by the end.
[482:08.61]The flush joke really saved him.
[482:10.49]Yeah, it did.
[482:15.17]Mainly.
[482:17.45]But don't worry about that, C4G.
[482:19.05]Thanks for the 250, and it was fun.
[482:21.01]It was a fun thing.
[482:26.11]Hey, Zach, or Zake, thanks for the 250.
[482:28.58]Sup, Jeremiah.
[482:29.28]Just wanted to share with you guys that today I got accepted to one of the top universities in Finland.
[482:34.38]Pretty frickin' happy.
[482:35.92]Have a beer on me.
[482:36.88]Also, you're my favorite internet entertainer guy by far.
[482:38.84]Cheers.
[482:38.98]Cheers.
[482:40.53]That's something to celebrate.
[482:42.43]Congratulations on being accepted to one of the top universities in Finland.
[482:46.41]I told you guys.
[482:48.97]There are smart people that are watching this stream.
[482:55.02]Lots of smart.
[482:58.90]Look at that school.
[482:59.90]Are you kidding me?
[483:02.60]But congratulations.
[483:04.40]Wish you luck.
[483:05.38]And not drinking beer right now, but I will drink some of this soda.
[483:09.52]Cheers.
[483:12.83]Thank you.
[483:14.15]And good luck.
[483:14.49]There are so many things to do in Las Vegas that I would not be able to even tell you anything.
[483:22.19]There is a hundred shows going on, thousands of restaurants and bars and clubs.
[483:39.42]The club part, maybe not so much, would be that interesting.
[483:42.05]But... Hash House of Go-Go in the Link is probably my favorite restaurant in Vegas.
[483:48.35]It's... Get the stuffed burger.
[483:51.41]Get the blue cheese stuffed burger from Hash House of Go-Go in the Link.
[483:55.01]And you... Your life will change completely forever.
[484:03.58]Getting... Go to... Go to a magic show.
[484:05.70]You know, there probably is a ton of those.
[484:11.45]Get drunk and wander around.
[484:12.65]Yeah, as long as you stay in, you know, stay on strip or stay downtown.
[484:16.95]Don't get too crazy.
[484:21.92]But, I hope you have fun.
[484:22.96]If you're of legal drinking age and you can go into the casinos.
[484:26.10]There's tons of bars and tons of stuff to do inside.
[484:34.22]Wasn't David Copperfield in town?
[484:36.48]Probably.
[484:38.60]Penn and Teller are here, I think, forever.
[484:42.61]I don't think they're ever going to leave.
[484:46.59]If you want to see Penn and Teller, they usually have the show.
[484:48.40]I think it's the Rio.
[484:55.66]They have residency there?
[484:56.58]Yeah.
[484:57.72]I got to go see Penn and Teller.
[484:59.11]They're awesome.
[485:02.41]They've been killing it for years.
[485:08.02]strip clubs I don't I don't I don't know that's up for you to decide with research I have no idea but thank you and I have a good trip Jerm lied about Taco Bell thanks to the 250 did someone say diablo sauce they did it was me
[485:30.55]Savoxky gave 10 community subs earlier.
[485:33.45]There were a lot of community subs, so I want to address the ones that I missed.
[485:37.73]But thank you, Savoxky, for the 10.
[485:42.69]BakeMeHome, thanks for the 250.
[485:43.69]Are you gonna play the new Pokémon games on stream?
[485:45.91]No, I don't think so.
[485:47.93]Never really was into Pokémon.
[485:51.51]I respect those games, but I don't play them.
[485:54.07]If that makes sense.
[485:56.95]BluePunda, thanks for the three bucks.
[485:58.31]BreathOfTheWild, when?
[486:02.71]I feel like I need to do God of War before I do Breath of the Wild.
[486:08.96]Does that make sense to anybody?
[486:13.96]No.
[486:14.82]Ew, no, no.
[486:21.19]No?
[486:21.39]That's a very strange thing to say, is it?
[486:28.18]Hey, I deleted those photos of me when I was eating.
[486:33.33]Yeah, um... God of War sounds like something I would do.
[486:41.74]And Breath of the Wild 2.
[486:42.46]There's an endless amount of games to play.
[486:51.35]He has to follow the timeline.
[486:53.71]No, Crescent, thanks for $5.
[486:54.99]Jerma is raiding chat.
[486:57.83]Um, I don't know what I was doing.
[486:59.65]But thank you for the $5.
[487:02.92]I did a few times and I did beat some of those levels.
[487:08.02]I'm so glad I actually beat that hellish one.
[487:12.64]What was it?
[487:13.34]Two people in the world beat it and I was number three?
[487:20.37]Feels pretty good.
[487:27.63]Oh, the controller.
[487:28.31]I will, but for real though, the down, I don't even need to say it.
[487:33.37]We already talked about it.
[487:34.63]I like, I put on a record and just let it just repeat over and over again.
[487:41.18]The down ground, the down ground, the down ground pound, like I've said that probably like a hundred times.
[487:50.48]I probably could have it on a button I could press and play it.
[487:58.65]But thank you, Lecronda, for the $5.
[488:00.33]Thank you, Captain Dread Pirate Tuco, for the $15.
[488:03.93]Okay, it was funny at first, but this whole I'm bad at driving joke is getting old.
[488:08.46]Move on already.
[488:12.28]Bad at driving.
[488:15.96]That level is so hard.
[488:19.54]That level is so hard.
[488:22.65]It takes precision.
[488:24.45]It takes time.
[488:25.31]The car is kind of hard to maneuver.
[488:30.16]I'm bad at driving joke.
[488:39.32]Well, thank you for the $15.
[488:40.12]I appreciate it.
[488:46.91]Yeah, it was desert bus.
[488:50.27]Nile Orion, thanks for the $4.
[488:51.23]Hey, Jerem, I'm going to McDonald's.
[488:53.53]Do you want anything?
[488:54.49]This was seven hours ago.
[488:58.52]I hope you got a McChicken, Nylorian.
[489:01.60]Hope you had fun.
[489:04.70]I wonder what you had.
[489:07.05]Hope you enjoyed it.
[489:10.27]MrSpicyDude, thanks for the five community subs.
[489:12.31]BonjourTristan, thanks for the three dollars.
[489:14.78]This guy is just kid jokes now.
[489:17.40]I want adult humor.
[489:24.59]E-Dragon, thanks for the $30.
[489:25.92]I missed this earlier, but thanks for the $30, E-Dragon.
[489:30.06]Use this towards your therapy bills.
[489:40.42]Thank you for the $30.
[489:41.06]I appreciate it.
[489:45.44]I'm on adult humor.
[489:58.91]He literally said Mario could eat his ass earlier.
[490:04.77]Yeah, I know.
[490:06.47]You know when you have this thing that you just want to say so bad, and you're just holding on to it, and you just have your mouth shut, and you just want to say it, but you know you shouldn't say it.
[490:17.38]You should not say this.
[490:20.30]But it just happens anyways, because you can't control yourself.
[490:24.41]You have to say this thing.
[490:30.33]I felt it coming out, and I felt my brain said, Stop saying what you'd ask.
[490:37.72]That's kind of how it played out.
[490:50.46]But, thank you Snooze and Copter for the 250.
[490:52.42]Dying or failing at something insanely difficult after acing the part before is something that defines you.
[490:58.09]I want to see a compilation of all the times this happened.
[491:00.59]Also, if you haven't played my levels yet, please do.
[491:02.83]Please.
[491:03.59]Please.
[491:06.02]I think I got a couple of them.
[491:07.58]We did at least one of them.
[491:16.45]Wait, you guys convinced him to eat McDonald's?
[491:19.67]I didn't need very much convincing.
[491:25.37]Did you actually, somebody made, did you, somebody just made a username Jerma lied about Breath of the Wild and God of War?
[491:34.94]Do you really have that non-faith in me at all?
[491:38.78]That 10 seconds after I say I, and maybe I'll play those games at some point, you immediately make that account?
[491:50.12]Wow.
[491:51.64]I... I gotta work on that.
[491:57.79]I need some internal development here.
[492:07.94]Dermalight accounts fall in.
[492:11.20]Bibinboy, thanks for the five subs.
[492:12.50]RarePepeBodyLusion, thanks for the five subs.
[492:16.52]I want to play the multiplayer.
[492:17.22]But everyone tells me it sucks and it's broken and laggy and all screwed up, right?
[492:20.06]I'll do it again.
[492:20.54]Oh, it was fixed.
[492:21.14]Okay.
[492:42.82]It's too interesting to not play it a few more times, I think.
[492:47.02]It really is.
[492:47.58]I feel like there's still a bunch of stuff I haven't seen that are worth streaming.
[492:57.87]We will see.
[492:59.31]You'll probably get at least one more Mario Maker 2 stream.
[493:02.93]Not this week, though.
[493:05.25]We've got Dark Souls Randomizer tomorrow.
[493:09.68]Which, if you thought today was a little bit wild and weird...
[493:14.24]I would probably show up tomorrow that's probably going to be even stranger I just had a weird flashback of the first person Abyss Watchers people in the chat were actually telling me dude like it's alright just like calm down and just stop for a while like everything's alright don't worry about it man
[493:42.92]It wasn't the typical, like, oh, you suck.
[493:46.16]Oh, I can't believe you missed that.
[493:48.00]It was like, hey, dude, just relax.
[493:49.24]Everything's alright.
[493:49.80]Don't worry about it.
[493:50.54]Everything's going to be fine.
[493:53.79]That's how you can tell that, like, you got to stop.
[494:01.83]Hey, just take a break.
[494:03.23]It's alright.
[494:03.83]Like, we can do something else.
[494:05.30]I'm rocking to do something else.
[494:08.02]Oh, man.
[494:12.95]I was all over the place for that hour and I was like almost two hours, three hours at the Abyss Watchers in first person.
[494:23.92]You get really mad when you play Souls.
[494:25.20]The angriest I've ever seen you was when you died to Twin Princes.
[494:31.38]Twin Princes.
[494:32.26]I don't even remember.
[494:33.06]Twin Princes.
[494:45.36]Dark Souls 3?
[494:55.28]Oh, the Lothric Prince.
[494:56.50]Okay.
[494:57.37]Yeah.
[494:59.55]Oh.
[495:09.83]Angry Gamer.
[495:13.07]Yeah.
[495:15.16]It's alright, though.
[495:15.96]It's all in good fun.
[495:21.68]The laser angel.
[495:22.92]No, now I remember that.
[495:25.81]I hated every second of that.
[495:32.71]The laser angel from that DLC area, I remember specifically almost hovering my mouse over just stop streaming.
[495:42.69]And then just pretend I had an internet outage.
[495:45.77]Like, just turn it off.
[495:46.77]Just turn the fucking whole thing off.
[495:48.95]Guys, sorry.
[495:49.61]Internet.
[495:49.99]Fuck.
[495:51.03]And just leave.
[495:55.45]I was so angry doing that.
[495:56.55]You're right.
[496:03.83]We're a total joke now.
[496:04.89]Yeah.
[496:10.09]But thank you to... Thank you to CyanideGift for 20 community subs.
[496:17.00]It's a shitload of subs to give in one night.
[496:25.12]Imagine doing that, but Etalyx is also streaming, so we know you lied.
[496:30.00]Well, I can't do that.
[496:33.17]You've got evidence.
[496:37.09]No, Cresson, thanks for $5.
[496:41.63]Convo Breaker, thanks for $5.
[496:44.59]So the major problem here wasn't that this was just painful.
[496:48.19]It was.
[496:48.59]And caused my mom to make groaning sounds.
[496:50.41]But the kicker was... Hold on.
[496:54.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[496:58.58]I think these are out of order.
[497:03.92]Oh, here we go.
[497:04.50]Yeah, it's out of order.
[497:05.46]They came in weird.
[497:06.80]They came in... Here we go.
[497:09.61]Hey Jerma, this is from Convo Breaker.
[497:11.03]15 dolls from Convo Breaker.
[497:13.87]So now they're in the correct order when I read them like this.
[497:16.11]Hey Jerma, I'm a little late on this, but happy three years of being subbed to you on Twitch.
[497:20.59]Thank you for that.
[497:21.79]Before I get into this story, I thought I'd say a couple one-guy moments so you know who I am.
[497:26.56]I'm both the guy who suggested the 250 bits minimum, and also the guy who you nearly killed in his sleep.
[497:34.14]What?
[497:34.24]What?
[497:36.71]wait anyways back in the day during my mother's third trimester with me she went to the zoo with a friend and her born kid they went to the turtle section they were making noise which was weird
[497:49.80]You guessed it, they were having turtle sex, which freaked out my mother's friend because she couldn't answer her kid to what they were doing.
[497:57.64]Meanwhile, my mom was dying laughing.
[497:59.82]Not but a few hours later, early in the next morning, my mom's water broke and she started having me.
[498:05.51]You are like six months old.
[498:13.47]You are the most advanced child I've ever seen in my life.
[498:19.13]Uh, this was a major problem because she needed a... The doctor was, we gotta wait for the pain meds to kick in.
[498:25.58]You need to try to resist the contractions.
[498:27.26]This was a problem.
[498:29.34]So the major problem here wasn't that this was painful.
[498:31.94]It was that it caused my mom to make groaning sounds.
[498:35.44]The kicker was my mom sounded like the turtles.
[498:38.37]So she was dying laughing, trying to resist contractions, waiting for a C. What is this, like, weird roleplay here?
[498:46.23]What is going on?
[498:52.58]Waiting for a c-section while I was about to take a shit in her stomach alright now.
[498:57.08]I'm ending it here I'm gonna move on Also, please play pyre.
[499:08.68]There's a giant lady, okay Duly noted
[499:21.16]I just opened... No, no, no, I just opened this stream and now I'm leaving.
[499:23.58]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[499:24.94]Let me just explain what just happened.
[499:26.86]Stay, are you still here?
[499:28.98]It's a bit message.
[499:30.08]I was reading a message somebody sent.
[499:32.88]They can send $2.50.
[499:34.14]$2.50 and I'll read it on stream.
[499:37.56]And I'm still here.
[499:38.52]Alright.
[499:39.23]So I was reading a story that some person just made up.
[499:44.69]And you came in right when you heard the whole thing about like shitting in stomach or something.
[499:48.51]So...
[499:51.41]I'm just reading a thing.
[499:54.76]And welcome to the channel.
[499:57.52]Okay.
[499:58.62]Yeah, enjoy.
[499:59.22]Follow that stream if you're having a good time.

[500:20.01]Thank you, Trampston.
[500:22.11]Trampston also gave $15 right after that.
[500:26.01]I'm going to come through your monitor and give you a quick kiss on the nose.
[500:34.58]I don't know, what are these a reference to?
[500:38.14]Trampston gave $6 again.
[500:40.38]Go to McDonald's, get McChicken.
[500:49.34]What is this?
[500:53.12]Are these references... Is this other streamer comedy here?
[500:56.29]Is this other YouTube comedy?
[501:10.20]I don't understand these references.
[501:12.78]Is this other YouTube comedy?
[501:14.22]Or Twitch comedy?
[501:18.43]It's a weird video.
[501:19.41]Oh.
[501:20.29]Well, thank you, Trampson, for the, uh, like, 28 bucks.
[501:24.18]More than that.

[501:31.20]Uh, thank you to Daisy Duke for the $5.
[501:32.96]Hey, Jerma, it was my birthday the other day, and I just want to thank you for making me laugh every stream.
[501:37.29]Can't wait for the Carnival stream, though every single one of your streams is just as special.
[501:41.01]Hey, love you lots.
[501:41.81]Have a great night.
[501:42.49]You too.
[501:47.07]Looking forward to the carnival stream as well.
[501:49.77]Hopefully it is a lot of fun.
[501:54.47]Back in thanks to the five dollars.
[501:57.91]Can't believe I had a pee pants moment sending you the wrong level called.
[502:00.73]Felt really bad there, but I'm glad you played it through anyway.
[502:03.49]Gives me insight on what to do and not to do for challenge levels in the future.
[502:07.79]Have a great rest of your night.
[502:08.93]It was a good level.
[502:11.95]It was a good level.
[502:13.98]Hey, let me tell you something back in.
[502:16.53]If your wrong code is that, then I'd like to see your right code.
[502:23.13]Because that was pretty damn good.
[502:25.63]So, thank you.
[502:34.43]Thanks for the five dollars.
[502:35.37]And thanks for your level.
[502:37.46]Pyrocat, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[502:38.80]I give you 10 bucks.
[502:40.76]Now you have to play my level.
[502:43.18]And they say, just kidding, but it would make my night if you did.
[502:47.86]Crazy boss fight with Meowser.
[502:55.96]Uh, we'll hold on to these.
[502:58.02]I'm gonna do it again, don't worry.
[502:59.78]We're gonna play this at least one more time.
[503:07.44]Thank you.
[503:09.20]Their night is ruined now.
[503:10.88]No, I'm going to remember that name.
[503:12.26]Pyrocat.
[503:12.86]I remember because they said muahaha.
[503:21.02]Pyrocat muahaha.
[503:22.48]That's the one I'm going to play.
[503:26.96]Thank you, JDiva, for the $15.
[503:29.28]Buy a Pro Controller.
[503:31.54]And they say Pride 100.
[503:32.23]Okay, but the Pro Controller... It's...
[503:38.72]I don't have a bunch of fucking Switch peripherals.
[503:47.13]That thing goes rot in the closet.
[503:55.81]It's one controller, but I got a Switch controller, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Pro controller, GameCube controller, Wii brick.
[504:08.95]I'm not made out of peripherals.
[504:13.67]Just buy it, you nerd.
[504:16.27]You can use the PS4 controller, but that takes intelligence.
[504:24.28]You are a peripheral.
[504:28.42]I don't know why, but that just offended me.
[504:30.90]That's offending me right now.
[504:33.08]I don't know why.
[504:34.23]Why is it offending me?
[504:46.13]Anyways, thank you, Jay, for the $15.
[504:47.33]Thank you, S10WUpdate, for the $10.
[504:51.85]$10.
[504:52.74]Hey, Jeremy, sorry you couldn't see my green screen video.
[504:57.26]Limited space or something.
[505:00.40]We did try to condense it, so if your video did not get through, don't worry.
[505:03.48]It wasn't a bad video.
[505:04.52]We just wanted to condense it.
[505:06.07]Anyways, the least I can do is donate to my favorite streamer for the first time.
[505:10.31]I'll hope you the best and keep being an inspiration.
[505:13.27]Have fun.
[505:15.92]Thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[505:19.24]I really appreciate it.
[505:25.60]I'm honored to be an inspiration for somebody.
[505:28.85]So thank you for 10 bucks and thanks for hanging out here.
[505:34.07]Hey Trampston, thanks for the five dollars.
[505:40.92]While you're here, look up Quaaludes on YouTube.
[505:46.32]Watch it while waiting for the McChicken.
[505:47.82]I already ate the McChicken.
[505:57.85]No, no YouTube video.
[505:59.41]I gotta go take a bath.
[506:04.29]It's in chat right now.
[506:05.37]I'll give it five seconds.
[506:08.27]That big man's back.
[506:10.39]www.thekickfrombrooklyn.com.
[506:13.93]You ever see them signs on the highway billboards years ago?
[506:20.36]I'd walk a mile for a camel when I used to have cigarette commercials.
[506:25.78]The guy used to say I'd walk a mile for a camel.
[506:29.46]Well, let me tell all you young people out there.
[506:33.20]The big man would walk 20 miles for a Quaalude, let me tell ya!
[506:40.41]That was the drug back there in the late 70s and 80s, Quaaludes!
[506:46.22]The good ol' Roarer 714 and they changed it to Lemon, I tell ya!
[506:54.25]And we had a couple of them fucking lemons now.
[506:57.21]That was the best fucking drug ever made.
[507:00.06]It was so
[507:10.85]non-narcotic, non-addictive, bring back the fucking Quaaludes.
[507:17.22]You can take all the fucking cocaine, marijuana, and all that fucking designer drugs they make today and stick them up your fucking ass.
[507:28.81]This doesn't like a fucking Quaalude.
[507:33.29]You thought you were on a fucking moon!
[507:34.59]Ah!
[507:48.14]This is the big man!
[507:49.68]The boy!
[507:50.36]The boy!
[507:51.50]Shut up, please!
[508:20.89]It worked.
[508:21.53]It was the same video.
[508:25.39]What probably will occur is I was playing the same video... You fucking... What the hell was that?
[508:56.02]He was just screaming.
[509:04.69]Thank you for that.
[509:09.47]Not addictive!
[509:12.55]I've never seen that.
[509:13.45]That's fucking bizarre.
[509:19.18]Oh my goodness.
[509:20.98]Anyways.
[509:25.28]Thank you to... Thank you to NicoCat for the five dollars.
[509:30.50]Hey, Jerma, usually I get too tired and have to leave early, but this Mario Maker stream has been one of my... One of the best, and I haven't been able to put it down.
[509:40.05]Jerma Hart.
[509:41.27]Thank you.
[509:41.77]I was wondering, have you ever heard of a game called La Mulana?
[509:45.81]It's a really interesting but difficult puzzle adventure game.
[509:48.13]I bet you'd enjoy it.
[509:48.97]Never heard of it.
[509:51.38]La Mulana.
[509:52.06]Let's look it up.
[509:54.16]La Mulana?
[509:58.52]It is currently on sale by an extreme margin.
[510:01.82]It is $5.
[510:02.44]Is it any good?
[510:05.28]Let's see.
[510:06.04]What is it?
[510:09.24]Is it like a Spelunky?
[510:12.88]I'm getting some Spelunky vibes.
[510:18.77]It's good?
[510:19.55]Is it good?
[510:19.95]It's good.
[510:20.27]Hmm.
[510:22.85]Alright, put it on the list.
[510:28.80]Put it on the list.
[510:31.12]Add it to the Dremelite about Guild Wars.
[510:34.67]God of War.
[510:36.09]Dremelite about Guild Wars too.
[510:38.61]I'm not playing that fucking game.
[510:44.96]But thank you for the five dollars.
[510:47.10]Vilemi, thanks for the $25.
[510:49.42]Better not fake this one.
[510:50.52]I ate three spicy McChickens on stream.
[510:53.64]And it was a mistake.
[510:55.46]Because I can already feel my stomach moving around.
[510:59.32]But it was worth it because it was good.
[511:00.84]Tasted good, except for the bones.
[511:02.34]Whatever they were.
[511:04.76]But thank you for the $20.
[511:06.81]That was a huge burp.
[511:07.75]And I sucked it in.
[511:08.71]You didn't hear it.
[511:10.31]Thank you, Vilemi, for your $25.
[511:13.37]Maxie Kaspersky, thanks for the three bucks.
[511:15.43]Maniac eats ass lettuce on stream.
[511:19.59]Yeah.
[511:21.67]Future Gamer, thanks for the $15.
[511:23.53]These cost me $20.
[511:24.79]You did it.
[511:29.88]Also, please listen to your horrid noises.
[511:32.34]You probably should turn your microphones down because this is gonna be loud.
[511:45.45]Yeah, that was a huge cartoon gulp, swallow, because I was nervous.
[511:54.31]Hey, but thanks for your $20 in 1,500 bits.
[511:59.86]Thank you.
[512:02.00]I did eat him, and he looked pretty good.
[512:05.82]Sykes Spiegel, thanks for the $15.
[512:08.68]Oh, that's not $15, it's $5.
[512:09.78]It's $5, no message, but thank you.
[512:12.01]Appreciate it.
[512:14.29]Hunter Peck, thanks for the 20 bucks.
[512:18.52]$20, here you go.
[512:19.12]I had to stay up until 1am to pay you to eat a McChicken.
[512:22.36]It's money well spent.
[512:23.72]But please, me first hard level.
[512:28.52]And easy level.
[512:29.60]Hold on to these.
[512:31.44]I'm gonna know, because Hunter Peck said $20 for the McChicken.
[512:34.31]These are two McChicken levels.
[512:41.61]The contract is complete.
[512:43.99]Hey, eggscramble, thanks for the $2.50.
[512:45.53]Would you ever serve McChickens that you sat on at a family dinner?
[512:49.64]If so, how long would you sit on them?
[512:51.70]Would you season with salt and pepper, maybe a little marshmallow fluff?
[512:56.28]I wouldn't sit on any food and serve it to somebody.
[513:02.30]Thanks for the $2.50.
[513:04.04]Eggscramble, appreciate it.
[513:11.76]Wait, why did the... That was, okay, EggScramble said that.
[513:15.96]Sykes Spiegel said this.
[513:18.62]Three bucks.
[513:20.28]I'm attributing messages to the wrong people.
[513:23.48]That was EggScramble that wants me to sit on food.
[513:29.22]Uh, Sykes Spiegel, thanks for the three dollars.
[513:30.90]Wait, what?
[513:47.82]Trash bag AutoMod.
[513:53.73]We'll tweak it.
[513:57.51]Thanks for the $3.
[514:01.73]Vilemi, thanks for the $25 more, Vilemi.
[514:04.95]And Vilemi gave 10 community subs right after it.
[514:08.13]I can't believe faked eating sandwich.
[514:10.28]What a scam.
[514:11.64]I ate three of them.
[514:14.78]You've given a lot of money and a lot of subs tonight, so thank you for both of those things.
[514:19.40]Let's get the credits to roll.
[514:20.58]That was the camera.
[514:27.14]Usually the credits are right at the top, but this time they're not.
[514:37.84]Roll... those credits.
[514:43.34]Are you gonna roll them or what?
[514:44.94]Are you gonna roll them or what?
[514:46.55]Are you gonna roll them or what?
[514:48.03]No, no, you're not gonna roll them.
[514:50.15]I'm gonna go in here and do it manually.
[514:53.29]Here they come.
[514:53.75]These are all the subs, all the resubs, gifted subs.
[514:58.78]Eight and a half hours worth tonight.
[515:00.44]Thank you, guys.
[515:03.10]All of you.
[515:04.20]Whether you're a new viewer, an old viewer, you happened to stumble upon this channel an hour ago.
[515:10.81]And follow.
[515:12.75]And then after the second or third mayonnaise on my mouth, you unfollowed.
[515:18.79]And you just went back to your normal day.
[515:20.69]Went back to whatever you were doing.
[515:22.81]Thank you.
[515:26.83]Really appreciate it, everybody.
[515:30.32]But we have some more bits to do as they fly by.
[515:33.94]No croissant, five dollars, no message, thank you.
[515:38.44]Uh, Vilemi, uh, ended the night here with another $5 drop.
[515:41.52]Hey, Jerma, all joking aside, I just want to say that your streams and videos have never failed to... These fucking McChickens are coming up.
[515:48.97]Never failed to brighten my day.
[515:51.11]Glad I can give something back, and I wish you the best in all your future endeavors.
[515:54.75]I'm going to get you to chug Mountain Dew someday, though, I swear to God.
[515:58.99]It would take a lot, because if I did that, my, like, intestinal problems would go nuts.
[516:04.72]I just looked over here and got sick, because I looked over at these bacon fries.
[516:15.22]But thank you, Vilemi.
[516:15.80]I'm more than happy to be here.
[516:20.36]But I don't think you're gonna get me to drink Mountain Dew Throwback.
[516:23.70]Because I will puke.
[516:26.64]Appreciate it, though.
[516:30.61]I'd ever agree.
[516:32.49]Thanks for the five bucks.
[516:34.71]Here's a new disgust emote.
[516:39.23]What the fuck am I thinking?
[516:44.96]I don't know what the hell's wrong with me.
[516:47.82]That's just seven and seven and a half hours of Mario Maker.
[516:50.39]You just kind of just don't give a shit anymore.
[516:52.47]You know?
[516:58.31]Thank you to DC Pro for the $2.85.
[517:00.47]Hey Jerem, funny ass munching tonight.
[517:04.22]Got any life advice?
[517:05.28]You seem like the person who would be able to share some good sense.
[517:08.84]Also, watch out for those chicken bones.
[517:13.04]I don't know if this is... There's two avenues that this comment could be.
[517:19.33]It could be serious, but then could be like you're eating salad with your hands.
[517:24.20]You could give me some good advice.
[517:25.56]You know what I mean?
[517:26.08]I'm not sure which avenue this is.
[517:38.05]This is my reaction to seeing any of his new low-effort streams.
[517:41.63]Once streamers and YouTubers start making money, they stop trying.
[517:48.30]What?
[517:56.04]It's the Imgur comment.
[518:00.83]I'm about to drop...
[518:03.02]If you think I'm dialing back, I'm not sure you've been paying attention.
[518:05.54]It might be ironic, I don't know.
[518:08.12]It could be bait, too.
[518:35.36]If that's your opinion and it's not baiting you, you're not fucking around, then I'm sorry Phil that way.
[518:43.93]But you won't do the... No, I'm not gonna do the macaroni tub.
[518:54.93]Ah, we've been baited.
[518:57.14]Pack it up.
[519:12.29]It's just these fucking low energy streams.
[519:21.15]If there's not two clowns I'm unsubbing, just wait.
[519:25.23]Just give me a little bit of time.
[519:28.72]All of your dreams will come true.
[519:42.82]A new car.
[519:43.66]Well, all of your stream dreams will come true.
[519:55.42]Anyways, let's keep going.
[520:00.63]Thank you to Nova Ostra for the $4.
[520:04.45]Jerma long time watcher, first time cheer, happy pride.
[520:07.57]And I absolutely love watching you.
[520:09.49]You never fail to make me laugh and help me feel better.
[520:11.95]You're so hilarious and creative.
[520:13.45]Much love to you.
[520:14.51]Thank you for all your hard work.
[520:16.71]And they say lesbian pride, transgender pride.
[520:19.79]Thank you so much.
[520:21.29]Nova Ostra.
[520:24.39]Long time watcher, first time cheer.
[520:25.97]It's never necessary, but thank you.
[520:35.49]I appreciate the very kind words.
[520:37.57]Thank you so much.
[520:44.63]I'm glad you think that.
[520:48.83]Also, EC Long, thanks for the 250.
[520:50.45]Hey, Jerm, I've been a fan since early 2013.
[520:52.69]I'm not able to catch every stream just because of my job, but my girlfriend and I both love your content.
[520:58.72]You're easily one of the greatest content creators.
[521:00.18]Internet personalities have had the pleasure of seeing.
[521:02.96]Good night.
[521:06.52]Thanks.
[521:07.56]That's a long time.
[521:10.68]Two back-to-back long-time watchers.
[521:15.79]Hope you stick around.
[521:16.41]Because there is way more to see.
[521:21.53]Thanks for the $2.50.
[521:23.75]Thank you BroDayDay for the $5.
[521:25.75]Appreciate it.
[521:27.12]No message.
[521:28.46]Five bucks.
[521:30.42]Regarnoy, thanks for the $3.
[521:32.64]Will you try my friend Pedro?
[521:35.58]really challenging and you should definitely check it out.
[521:44.36]I heard it's fun.
[521:45.14]I heard it's hard to control though.
[521:50.84]Oh, no, fuck.
[521:53.68]Come on.
[522:03.19]The fucking salad just hit the ground.
[522:08.77]And it's everywhere.
[522:15.53]God damn it.
[522:28.46]It's fucking fantastic.
[522:29.28]I was gonna eat that.
[522:30.04]I was gonna eat this.
[522:30.90]I still might.
[522:37.42]You just have to rinse it.
[522:39.80]It's lettuce.
[522:40.40]You just hold it under cold water.
[522:42.28]It'll be alright.
[522:46.37]Five second rule?
[522:47.09]It's lettuce.
[522:50.65]How did that even happen?
[523:00.50]you know I'm just glad it wasn't the uh bacon cheese french fries because that imagine there was um dressing all over this that's the best possible scenario of something dropping something remember when you asked me if I was sure about eating in my office six months ago yeah but this was different this was
[523:24.88]Yeah, but this was different.
[523:25.98]This was not... This was... I know.
[523:30.71]Alright.
[523:31.29]Alright.
[523:31.61]I'm out of here.
[523:32.19]I gotta get out of here.
[523:33.61]I gotta go.
[523:33.97]I gotta go.
[523:39.58]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[523:49.89]Actually, there's two more bits.
[523:51.97]But, uh, Regardo gave $3.
[523:55.35]My friend Pedro.
[523:56.49]It was worth a look.
[523:57.77]We just got a lot of shit to do.
[524:01.45]Broday, thanks for the $5.
[524:03.71]Never donated before.
[524:04.45]I completely forgot to send a message, but I've been a fan for years.
[524:07.93]And seeing the PlayStation Spellbook videos in high school.
[524:11.43]You're the only streamer I watch, and I really appreciate everything you're doing for the community.
[524:14.64]Keep being awesome.
[524:15.26]You're honestly the best.
[524:18.89]That's a... That's fucking an incredibly nice thing to say.
[524:27.32]I hope you keep watching.
[524:28.28]There's a lot more to do.
[524:30.58]In this time that I have on this platform.
[524:33.26]I'm gonna try it.
[524:38.28]And the two right at the very end.
[524:39.34]Tingy250.
[524:39.96]Fill a tub with Jell-O and sit in it.
[524:43.96]It's a waste of food.
[524:44.80]I don't wanna do that.
[524:47.65]I don't want to fill a tub with mac and cheese.
[524:49.33]I would rather eat the mac and cheese very slowly over the course of three years.
[524:56.94]Jell-O's not food.
[525:04.42]Yes, I have.
[525:06.06]The God games, they seem very fun.
[525:07.56]There's still just a ton of things to do.
[525:25.44]That's why the recommended channel really is so good.
[525:27.38]If you have anything, just put it there.
