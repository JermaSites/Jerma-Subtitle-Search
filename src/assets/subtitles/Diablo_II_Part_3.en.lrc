[00:01.14]Ah, yes, Super Frog.
[00:02.50]Hi, guys.
[00:05.74]We're a little early, yeah.
[00:07.80]I want to start early because this stream, I'm not going to have very much time today.
[00:12.37]If you don't know, this stream is the last stream you're going to get for a small but significant amount of time.
[00:26.48]After today's stream, you will not see me again until Friday of next week.
[00:35.53]I'm not going to be here for about five or six straight days.
[00:38.27]Part of the reason why I wanted to do five plus days in a row here.
[00:49.30]I'm supposed to start in 30 minutes.
[00:50.60]Yeah.
[00:51.10]We're starting early because I don't have... I have until about...
[00:56.39]four to five hours from right now.
[00:58.57]So I wanted to really start and get going.
[01:06.34]What are we supposed to do for that time?
[01:09.24]I recommend you read the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[01:16.58]It'll take you a week, and then you can come back to me and say, hey, I've read it all.
[01:24.54]Actually, that'd probably take longer.
[01:27.59]That actually would probably take a couple months.
[01:30.18]So I'm not leaving for a couple months.
[01:32.14]I'm leaving for about a week.
[01:35.66]A little less than a week.
[01:44.15]What a waste of time.
[01:46.77]Oh, man.
[01:47.97]You guys really don't like reading.
[01:49.59]But the plan today is to try and continue our hardcore Diablo II adventure.
[01:58.60]If you've missed the last two or three times we've done this, we are standing outside of Diablo's area.
[02:10.73]So Diablo is within 20 minutes of where we are right now.
[02:16.29]And we have the skeleton crew trying to fight Diablo.
[02:23.52]So, if this stream turns out to be 40 minutes long because I die to Diablo because I'm not prepared for it, we'll do something else.
[02:37.45]But the plan is to try to stay alive and to get into Act 5 and keep going.
[02:43.96]We'll see.
[02:46.72]Don't flatter yourself.
[02:48.00]I feel like it'll take 40 minutes to even get to him.
[02:51.58]Because of how our character is currently built.
[02:54.00]The plan is simple.
[03:03.73]Yeah, if I die in Diablo, Asura's Wrath DLC is the plan.
[03:10.23]But I don't plan on dying in Diablo.
[03:13.71]I plan on playing for at least a few hours.
[03:23.91]Here comes the flush force.
[03:27.02]For the love of God, please do not die.
[03:31.14]We have an interesting chat today, I think, because a bunch of people in chat might want me to die because they want to see Asura's Wrath really bad, the DLC there.
[03:41.29]But there are also a bunch of people that don't want to see the Asura's Wrath DLC.
[03:46.17]And they're like, no, I don't want that.
[03:48.95]Please stay alive in Diablo.
[03:53.29]It's going to be an interesting day.
[03:55.13]There's a civil war here.
[03:56.27]Alright, we've waited long enough.
[03:59.49]It's been about five minutes.
[04:01.29]Let's get into it.
[04:01.83]Hope you're having a good day.
[04:02.55]If you missed yesterday's stream... Well, yeah, technically yesterday.
[04:07.35]Tony Hawk's Underground was a lot of fun.
[04:10.90]Let's try to kill Diablo.
[04:12.28]I'm almost level 30.
[04:18.24]So... I got to get a refresher here.
[04:23.82]Oh, that's right.
[04:24.38]We did Ral Ral, probably the worst thing ever.
[04:28.22]I made stealth.
[04:29.04]I don't really have very good items, do I?
[04:33.42]My items are kind of terrible.
[04:38.02]Alright.
[04:38.68]I'm gonna die in the first five minutes.
[04:40.58]I know.
[04:42.58]Hey, get your Asura's Wrath DLC hype ready in the chat, boys and girls.
[04:48.50]Because I'm probably dead in ten minutes.
[04:52.84]I need a skeleton crew.
[04:55.60]To refresh your memory, here is where chat has decided to put the points.
[05:03.90]We have a lot in Iron Golem.
[05:05.10]I'm going to make sure you just give a quick little refresher course.
[05:07.74]It's been about a week and a half since you've seen this.
[05:10.85]Ray Skeleton.
[05:13.03]Skeleton Mastery.
[05:16.55]You've gone down into the golems.
[05:20.78]iron golem members iron golem gives synergy 20 attack rating per level to all golems you've put points into skeleton mage we are about to unlock in if I'm stay alive that is we are about to unlock fireman or revive both of these are very good fire golem or revive
[05:49.37]Revive just lets you bring any character back to life.
[05:52.87]That's not a boss.
[05:55.40]So, if one of those big demon guys dies, I can bring them back to life.
[06:03.30]And I can do this... Like, you can have, like, 20, I think, monsters out at once.
[06:09.87]I feel like there's gonna be a fight here.
[06:12.63]Uh, thanks for the two teeth.
[06:13.63]It was a waste of a point.
[06:15.93]People thought it was funny.
[06:16.71]I mean, I laughed...
[06:19.59]It was pretty funny.
[06:22.43]And then Amplify Damage, obviously.
[06:23.87]If you don't put a 1 point in Amplify Damage as a Necromancer, I mean, what the hell are you doing?
[06:28.91]So, that about does it.
[06:29.69]We have this guy here.
[06:30.61]We have, uh, Vic is still with us.
[06:32.67]Vic, uh, by the way, Vic has better gear than I do.
[06:37.08]So, Vic is the, uh, the real hero here.
[06:44.26]So, let's do River of Flame.
[06:48.22]I'm, I think I'm ready.
[06:51.66]I didn't even get it.
[06:52.82]Wait.
[06:54.70]Did I not step on the waypoint?
[07:01.99]Did I not step on the waypoint last time?
[07:05.93]No, I did, didn't I?
[07:08.09]Didn't we get to the River of Flame and I stepped on the waypoint, did I?
[07:12.97]That's a big oops.
[07:15.34]Oh, shit.
[07:16.12]That's actually really bad.
[07:19.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:20.78]Okay, okay, okay.
[07:21.42]Alright.
[07:22.76]Now, I got here... Yep, right.
[07:26.88]Right, right, right.
[07:27.52]Okay, we're good.
[07:30.09]I didn't get to the waypoint.
[07:31.15]I did the, uh... The gems.
[07:34.67]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[07:35.57]This is... Probably gonna be a quick one.
[07:40.81]So what happened in Asura's Wrath so far, the story?
[07:43.62]You're one of the eight deities.
[07:45.84]Or you were until you were cast away from all... from... there's seven of them now.
[07:54.37]Nah, we'll be fine.
[07:55.19]Just let me get my skeleton crew up and we'll be good to go.
[07:59.91]My mana... I have such shit mana.
[08:04.39]Alright, we can have five regular skeletons and we can have three mages, I believe.
[08:11.03]Alright, we got the whole crew.
[08:14.05]We need to amplify damage.
[08:15.05]Alright, I feel a little safer.
[08:20.74]What is my fire resistance?
[08:22.58]Not good.
[08:25.64]I don't think we should fight Diablo without proper fire resistance, but you know.
[08:31.00]We'll see if we can get some.
[08:41.54]I'm going to take it very slow.
[08:42.68]I really don't want to play Diablo for 12 minutes.
[08:51.04]I would like to actually kill Diablo.
[08:53.76]Alright, let's go this way.
[08:54.52]Alright, any mages?
[09:03.49]Like, for instance, up here.
[09:04.49]A lot of fucking people.
[09:11.30]Diablo is a discount sun joke.
[09:18.20]You could say that.
[09:19.04]But today is going to be fairly chill.
[09:20.98]It's not going to be that long.
[09:22.38]It'll be probably about three, four, five hour long stream.
[09:28.66]I want to relax a little bit.
[09:29.90]Last night was a little all over the place.
[09:33.70]I got some good sleep though.
[09:35.26]I'm feeling refreshed.
[09:41.69]You are so fucked laughing my ass off.
[09:44.19]I know.
[09:44.53]I know.
[09:47.36]I see the end of the tunnel.
[09:49.56]And I know what the outcome is.
[09:52.70]What's really going to end up happening is this guy is going to have to kill Diablo.
[10:01.64]Not me.
[10:01.88]I'm going to have nothing to do with it.
[10:11.09]That guy.
[10:11.67]Yeah, Vic.
[10:14.27]He's the one that killed Durial.
[10:16.14]He's the one that killed Mephisto.
[10:17.56]And he'll be the one to kill Diablo.
[10:23.26]I'm just a bard that follows him around.
[10:26.30]With my skeleton band.
[10:30.34]We just sing while he fucking does work.
[10:37.33]All these skeletons all have different fucking instruments.
[10:42.26]What a real pain in the ass that would be too.
[10:44.30]Imagine you had like a full eight person band following you around.
[10:48.78]Three of them are singing.
[10:53.77]Two of them have little drums.
[10:55.83]Be like, get the fuck away from me.
[11:00.33]They're all getting in the way.
[11:03.77]That would suck.
[11:07.51]Because that's what we're doing to this guy.
[11:11.72]Alright, where are we going?
[11:14.68]I really do want the waypoint, though.
[11:19.42]One of them's playing their ribcage like a xylophone.
[11:24.19]Oh, that's so stupid.
[11:29.13]I love it.
[11:30.49]I love it.
[11:37.02]I really do wonder what you guys are going to do, because revive is so good.
[11:41.16]It's so good.
[11:44.28]But, you know, there is a channel community character.
[11:47.35]I feel like that's going to win out over anything else.
[11:51.05]Let's go up here.
[12:01.32]How's everybody doing?
[12:01.80]Everyone good?
[12:02.54]Everyone feel safe?
[12:03.44]Nobody's dead, so that's a good sign.
[12:08.09]When I open the seals, though, that's where it's going to be really painful.
[12:20.45]That was a lot of damage with one hit.
[12:27.62]I think I'm going to get a pull going.
[12:30.52]Or maybe one of the mods can do it well, because I don't really want to die.
[12:36.75]Do you think I will beat Diablo?
[12:37.91]Do you think I will kill Diablo?
[12:38.91]I got a wink?
[12:39.73]Did I?
[12:39.97]Oh, I'll do the poll.
[12:43.57]Let me see.
[12:43.93]Did I get a wink?
[12:46.84]No, I didn't.
[12:49.22]No, I didn't.
[12:51.06]Nice try, though.
[12:54.68]Let me get a poll.
[12:55.42]I'm actually curious as to what people think about this.
[13:03.70]Because I have my answer, but I want to know your answer.
[13:06.40]I'm curious what your answer is.
[13:30.99]Let's see.
[13:37.80]Vote on this.
[13:38.52]I'm going to check it later.
[13:39.46]Okay, let's go.
[13:54.12]Those are three very real scenarios.
[13:55.90]I do, I don't, and just die.
[14:01.10]Or, I give up.
[14:03.86]Because I have to run back and forth to the Bloodmoor.
[14:09.18]There is a no option for you both dying.
[14:14.36]I'm not gonna... No, this isn't like a boxing game.
[14:18.90]We're not gonna do a double knockout.
[14:23.13]One of us is dead.
[14:25.27]Or I take 10% HP off of his bar every 8 minutes.
[14:29.93]And it gets to about 40% of the way there, and it's been 40 minutes, and I'm just done.
[14:34.11]And I'm like, no, never mind.
[14:41.66]Any of those are possible.
[14:42.54]I can get it.
[14:53.74]Once we get to the actual, that, like, sanctuary place.
[14:57.35]Not sanctuary, you know what I mean.
[14:59.37]What's the place before Diablo called?
[15:01.71]It has a specific name.
[15:02.51]It's called, like, not the river.
[15:03.33]What is it?
[15:03.79]It's like his castle.
[15:06.23]Why do I not know this?
[15:13.95]Do you actually like this game, Jeremy?
[15:15.57]Do you enjoy playing this?
[15:16.45]I feel like you really want to play Goat Simulator.
[15:24.21]There it is.
[15:24.73]Okay, good.
[15:25.27]Here we go.
[15:28.09]You know, I'm really just hiding the fact that I want to play Goat Simulator.
[15:30.85]Here it comes.
[15:31.21]Proceed, hero, into Terror's lair.
[15:35.01]Know that Diablo's innermost sanctum is hidden by five seals.
[15:39.60]Only by opening each of these seals can you clear your way to the final battle.
[15:45.93]Why don't any of these angels help?
[15:47.27]Proceed, hero.
[15:52.39]You're the Nephilim.
[15:53.69]That's why you can do this.
[15:54.75]Did I mention I can shoot lightning out of my hand?
[16:00.10]No, you do it.
[16:00.78]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[16:10.31]I understand, like, the whole, no, no, no, I can't interfere, I can't interfere.
[16:13.25]Tyrael could just do a cleave and kill every enemy on this fucking map.
[16:19.64]Like, could you at least just do that for me?
[16:21.36]Fine.
[16:22.48]Don't fight Diablo.
[16:24.44]But can you just drop, like, a fucking angel nuke on this spot so we can just walk to him?
[16:30.97]And, look, you can ghost ride it.
[16:33.23]I'll just say I did it.
[16:38.89]In the history books, it'll just be like, and then the brave skeleton necromancer conjured up a gigantic ball of lightning and dropped it onto the river of flame.
[16:48.99]Like, why can't you just say that?
[16:49.95]Does it matter?
[16:57.86]And I'll just, in all the interviews I do afterwards, I'll just be like, yeah, no, it was, I don't know, I just kind of did, I used all my strength.
[17:05.11]I tried as hard as I could, and I, yeah, I can never do it again, though.
[17:09.35]I used all my energy.
[17:14.24]He has a CCTV installed?
[17:27.75]Wait, like they're monitoring what's going on right now?
[17:30.72]Yeah, but you wouldn't like the game.
[17:43.62]Yeah, but we're talking strictly lore here.
[17:45.58]We're not talking about video gameplay.
[17:54.50]Don't die.
[17:56.48]I got a full crew, right?
[18:01.88]Once those Super Uniques come out of the seals is where I'm really gonna have to shit my pants.
[18:06.59]I gotta have portals ready.
[18:10.61]Can you imagine a guy named Tommy Lee Bones in the history books?
[18:21.58]Use Teeth.
[18:22.96]Teeth does 3 damage.
[18:26.16]What I'm doing right now does 36 to 104.
[18:27.34]Teeth does 3!
[18:38.92]Alright, Golem's gonna die.
[18:43.60]Okay, come on.
[18:44.36]A little bit higher.
[18:51.92]I have to kill Diablo with teeth.
[18:55.55]You want to last hit Diablo with teeth?
[18:57.99]Would that make you guys happy?
[18:59.63]Would you guys be happy, satisfied if I did that?
[19:06.60]I'm not even sure it's possible.
[19:08.30]Alright, here it is.
[19:14.49]Oh, boy.
[19:15.59]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[19:17.19]Just... Back it up.
[19:27.22]I need fire resistance.
[19:30.66]Bad.
[19:30.96]Bad.
[19:35.23]I still have these stamina potions for some reason.
[19:39.85]Dude, that was an auto-chew.
[19:44.53]What am I going to do with this shit?
[19:46.95]Does anything have fire resistance?
[19:48.67]Ooh, this does.
[19:51.87]I lose 41 health.
[19:55.76]That's a lot of health, but I gain 25%.
[19:56.96]I...
[19:59.27]Me taking... Let's say I take 100 points of damage from fire.
[20:03.21]Like somebody does a 100 damage spell.
[20:06.08]Is having 41 more health better than taking 75% of that?
[20:17.48]The health is better, right?
[20:18.94]Or is the percentage better?
[20:21.76]I don't know.
[20:22.40]We need to do some math.
[20:26.81]I'm gonna wear it.
[20:27.89]Any other fire resist?
[20:36.14]shields.
[20:36.58]You know what?
[20:36.96]I need like a socket shield.
[20:38.30]Because with the socketed shield, I could just dump rupees into it and get fire zest.
[20:50.10]Jerma's ruining Chat's character.
[20:51.73]What?
[20:53.99]I'm just trying to survive, man.
[20:55.97]This inventory's a mess.
[21:01.23]I should just sell this thing.
[21:05.57]Alright, I'm selling this.
[21:07.81]I'm at 33% fire resist.
[21:11.42]It's not very good.
[21:12.16]The resist is way better than 40 health.
[21:20.74]I'm under 300, though.
[21:22.03]I'm gonna get fucking double tapped and die instantly.
[21:28.13]Do I have any... I can't do anything.
[21:31.01]Alright, some of these trash can runes have got to go here eventually, I think.
[21:36.65]How many portals do I have?
[21:39.51]Plenty.
[21:42.25]Let's go.
[21:42.81]Vic's still alive, right?
[21:46.63]Alright, everybody get up here.
[21:48.09]There's the Chaos Sanctuary right here.
[21:49.63]Oh, fuck.
[21:55.57]What do they have for resistance right now?
[21:58.09]Uh-oh.
[22:11.04]Uh-oh.
[22:12.45]Golem going down.
[22:15.09]Vic, you gotta stay alive, man.
[22:16.05]Did we drop Ruby?
[22:22.41]Puke, Cloud, dead.
[22:24.11]Good.
[22:24.49]Nice work.
[22:28.11]I'm gonna turn that into a friend.
[22:31.51]Gothic Shield.
[22:33.49]Wait, I don't have anything.
[22:36.84]I need to find, like, a weapon.
[22:40.98]There, I did that.
[22:41.95]There, let's go.
[22:45.01]Dodge the missiles.
[22:50.43]We good?
[22:51.55]Alright, into the sanctuary.
[22:52.29]Let's go.
[22:55.82]I'm actually nervous right now.
[22:57.24]I've never played a character on hardcore.
[22:58.78]I always just run in and just don't give a shit.
[23:02.62]Because if I die, who cares, right?
[23:04.36]But even on normal, I'm kind of scared.
[23:07.27]I really don't want to die.
[23:09.81]But this is a place where I can die.
[23:11.51]Because the boss here is scary and he's hard.
[23:17.76]Because if you just... I don't know.
[23:19.38]We'll see.
[23:20.08]I'm scared.
[23:31.73]The one thing I am very thankful of is... Besides the mages.
[23:35.23]The mages kind of suck...
[23:38.70]Everyone's staying alive in here, which is encouraging.
[23:44.91]What do I do if I die?
[23:45.91]That's it.
[23:49.29]I close Diablo.
[23:52.65]What else can I do?
[23:53.45]Make a new character?
[23:54.57]I'm not going to do that.
[23:58.33]Be sad for five to ten minutes and then move on to something else.
[24:09.79]Alright, we gotta do the seals.
[24:12.75]If you'd like to see where we're gonna end up.
[24:17.09]Diablo spawns in here.

[25:10.78]Alright.
[25:12.08]What does Vic have for fire resistance?
[25:16.21]58.
[25:18.75]Just keep Vic alive.
[25:23.55]Keep Vic alive.
[25:27.02]What you gotta do is you gotta get the ball to tuck.
[25:35.24]Arnold, I want you to pass over here to Helga.
[25:38.40]Helga, I want you to drive to the hoop, and then I want you to get the ball to tuck.
[25:53.29]You guys don't like Hey Arnold?
[25:59.54]Nobody likes that show?
[26:03.60]How old are you guys?
[26:14.97]Hey Arnold was like 20.
[26:16.75]If you guys are like 20, you didn't see Hey Arnold?
[26:19.23]That was a big thing in Hey Arnold.
[26:24.77]Oh shit, we got stuck.
[26:32.10]I loved Hey Arnold.
[26:37.18]That character wasn't in the show for very long.
[26:39.48]But that was like a big episode.
[26:45.80]Alright, I'll keep my references to... I'll keep my references to Garfield and SpongeBob.
[27:02.57]Garfield's older than Hey Arnold.
[27:04.11]That's what I... He's just still relevant, though.
[27:06.39]He's been around for a long time.
[27:15.13]Thank you, thank you, that's better.
[27:16.88]When was the last time any of you guys actually read a Garfield comedy?
[27:30.25]I'm not talking about online, I'm talking about in a newspaper.
[27:40.25]Never?
[27:40.57]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[27:46.60]For the amount of stuff you guys... For the amount of talk... For the amount that everyone talks about Garfield, I was assuming you guys were all big fans.
[28:05.69]I get requests to play Garfield's cart.
[28:08.41]Maybe like once every four days.
[28:10.03]Alright, I have to be careful up here.
[28:18.15]This spear sucks.
[28:20.53]This sucks too.
[28:20.99]I don't even want it.
[28:27.16]He said it.
[28:28.82]See ya, let's go!
[28:29.54]Is this Lord de Sace?
[28:31.84]Do I remember?
[28:39.78]Eugh.
[28:52.68]Diablo does x7 damage to summons.
[28:56.00]Well, that's gonna end very well for us.
[29:01.46]I'm so fucked.
[29:03.00]I'm so fucked.
[29:03.98]You have no idea, guys.
[29:04.98]I'm so fucked.
[29:06.57]I have to fight Diablo alone.
[29:10.53]I'm so... I'm gonna die.
[29:12.07]It's gonna be really, really bad.
[29:24.38]I need to get more fire resist if I stand a chance.
[29:30.71]We'll probably get to level 30 though, so that'd be good.
[29:34.81]Don't get in the middle of a fire storm.
[29:53.76]Come on, level up.
[29:55.22]I need it.
[29:55.56]A huge amount of money just came in.
[29:57.87]Hold on.
[29:59.47]Actually huge, huge money.
[30:02.25]Let me see the... Let me check this first.
[30:04.85]Will he kill Diablo?
[30:07.23]Most of you think yes.
[30:09.43]Besides the people that think I'm going to run around in circles for 30 minutes and then give up.
[30:13.90]I appreciate the enthusiasm, though.
[30:15.12]Thank you.
[30:15.92]Thanks, guys.
[30:20.57]I just mentioned it and now more votes are coming in.
[30:22.73]Alright, alright.
[30:23.43]Not very many people don't think I'm gonna do it.
[30:25.89]That really is encouraging.
[30:27.17]Okay, let's get my... Let's get my bits up here.
[30:40.30]Somebody gave a hundred bucks.
[30:42.82]Rentaburger gave 10,000 bits.
[30:47.22]Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars, Rentaburger.
[30:52.76]I can't believe I get to become a sub-baby in a Diablo II stream.
[30:55.72]I've come a long way from the first of your videos I ever saw.
[30:58.68]I watched Jermania in 2014 for almost an entire minute before I realized it was funny on purpose.
[31:12.51]Uh, I'm confused.
[31:13.91]What?
[31:14.03]What does that mean?
[31:16.19]I watched Jermania for almost an entire minute before I really... Oh, you thought it was somebody making like a real league or something?
[31:25.28]Funny by accident.
[31:29.62]That's so funny.
[31:33.36]Yeah, we got a wink too.
[31:39.84]Got my backpack.
[31:40.48]I'm ready for school.
[31:42.24]Hey, is that a different Jerma?
[31:44.30]He looks different today.
[31:51.29]I'm not wearing overalls.
[31:55.32]It's imposter, Jeremy.
[31:56.62]No, it's because my pupils are small, because the sun's in my eyes.
[31:58.98]That's what people don't... That's what it is.
[32:03.46]I'm not wearing a backpack.
[32:06.26]No, I'm wearing my boomer brace.
[32:09.00]For my costochondritis.
[32:13.11]You have small pupils.
[32:17.73]I do look like I'm going to school, though.
[32:23.48]Just waiting for the bus, mom.
[32:25.74]No, it's- I got a cost of chondritis and I got a fucking back brace on.
[32:33.79]Desi, wink.
[32:39.99]Ah, but Rent-A-Burger, thank you so much for the fucking ridiculous amount of money.
[32:45.64]$100.
[32:45.66]I never expect anyone to give $1, let alone 100 of them.
[32:48.54]Seriously, thanks.
[32:53.99]Am I wearing beads on my wrist?
[32:56.43]Shit!
[32:57.99]Shit that you saw it!
[33:00.45]God damn it!
[33:05.99]No!
[33:10.48]I forgot this was on.
[33:15.63]It's black tourmaline.
[33:18.72]It's like a crystal bracelet.
[33:21.52]I'm just wearing it because it's a crystal bracelet.
[33:24.64]It's black tourmaline.
[33:27.50]And it's supposed to help with your energy.
[33:29.68]It's not.
[33:30.10]It's made up.
[33:30.94]It's literally all made up.
[33:33.88]I just thought it was cute.
[33:34.90]So I put it on.
[33:36.87]It's literally the whole thing's made up.
[33:40.39]Somebody made it up and sold bracelets to people.
[33:45.06]I just thought it was cool.
[33:46.40]It's like, cool.
[33:47.28]That's an interesting idea.
[33:49.93]Like, oh, it's like crystals.
[33:51.21]It's like power crystals.
[33:52.71]I know, it could be just bullshit.
[33:54.49]Whatever, it's fun.
[33:56.11]It was like 12 bucks.
[33:58.97]Add a couple zeros.
[34:02.23]It's cool.
[34:02.59]There's like different crystals.
[34:04.43]This is like... Look.
[34:07.18]Okay, hold on.
[34:07.86]Let me... Why is my game crashing?
[34:13.23]I am not gonna lose in act... I'll save and exit.
[34:21.08]Okay.
[34:22.94]Look.
[34:23.88]See?
[34:25.62]Isn't this cool?
[34:26.18]It's like a gem.
[34:27.65]It's like a stone.
[34:28.57]It's a crystal.
[34:29.11]It's kind of interesting.
[34:34.07]I don't think it's going to heal my ailments.
[34:39.59]I think it looks cool, and it's an interesting concept, and it's cool history.
[34:45.34]I always take this off before a stream, because I know someone's going to be like, what the fuck is he wearing?
[34:48.68]And then I have to do a baby food explanation.
[34:51.40]And I wanted to avoid the baby food explanation, but I had...
[34:59.59]Everybody's dead everybody's dead everybody's dead.
[35:02.55]I have to hold on I leveled up Why is everybody getting smoked?
[35:23.53]Somebody said it's just a bracelet dude.
[35:24.93]It's alright.
[35:25.65]I know but I
[35:29.37]It's like a black tourmaline crystal stone bracelet.
[35:40.15]Holy fuck, this guy is eating me alive.
[35:49.96]I think it's neat.
[35:50.58]Yeah, I think it's cool.
[35:51.86]It's hard.
[35:56.97]We good?
[35:58.17]Who is it?
[35:58.43]Is it Lord Desaes?
[36:00.56]Alright, get in there and... Holy fuck.
[36:03.76]I'm in trouble.
[36:05.68]Just gonna keep putting people in there.
[36:10.28]Dude, they're dying before they can even come out of... They're dying before they can even, like, get out of the womb or whatever this is.
[36:26.77]Get in there.
[36:34.23]Goodbye.
[36:34.51]We're gonna fall back.
[36:40.94]And we have a point to put in.
[36:43.62]That's priority number one right now.
[36:45.60]We get a point.
[36:47.46]Click maps are gonna be enabled here.
[36:49.10]If you'd like to vote for something, you just have to click the screen.
[36:54.17]You'll see it on the screen in just a moment.
[36:59.37]Okay, so here's what the points are so far.
[37:06.25]We have unlocked the bottom row on the summoning side, and again, this is Fire Golem, and this is Revive.
[37:12.96]Revive can bring anything back to life for a significant portion of time.
[37:16.76]Fire Golem is Fireman.
[37:20.34]We also have the other points here.
[37:22.15]Summon Resist, Golem Mastery,
[37:29.26]You don't have to be embarrassed about owning crystals for their properties.
[37:34.58]I know.
[37:34.84]Don't worry.
[37:37.48]It gives me power.
[37:38.18]How do you guys think I can, like, fucking... How do you think... Where do you think my comedy comes from?
[37:40.79]It comes from this fucking bracelet.
[37:42.11]If I don't wear this, I'm not funny.
[37:44.41]This is where it comes from.
[37:47.81]It's a comedy bracelet.
[37:53.20]When I take this off, I like, I like decryptify.
[37:56.75]I got somewhere.
[37:57.31]I got like boomer brace on, like power crystals.
[38:02.21]Alright, where do you guys want to go?
[38:08.83]What are you thinking?
[38:11.35]We may have to zoom in for this one.
[38:22.88]We might have to zoom in.
[38:25.76]We'll see if it splits.
[38:36.11]Do I have a Zen Garden?
[38:37.41]No, it would die.
[38:38.03]I wouldn't be able to take care of it.
[38:45.94]I would be like, dude, Zen Garden.
[38:48.22]Oh, I can't wait.
[38:49.22]And I would, the first day, I would snip, snip, snip, trim, trim, trim.
[38:52.36]Place the rocks.
[38:53.34]Put the trees.
[38:54.62]Ooh, this is so cool.
[38:55.64]And I'd put it out in the sun.
[38:56.72]Wow.
[38:57.16]And I'd forget it was there.
[38:58.02]And then three weeks later, everything would be dead.
[39:00.58]And I would find it.
[39:09.84]I gotta zoom in.
[39:12.05]Oh, wait.
[39:14.17]That's one of those trees.
[39:15.09]That's one of those little trees.
[39:16.72]Wrong.
[39:17.40]Zen Garden is not... What's it called?
[39:19.70]The little tree?
[39:20.34]The bonsai tree.
[39:22.08]Yeah.
[39:22.40]Whoops.
[39:23.48]Zen Garden is just sand with rocks.
[39:26.82]I'd fucking spill it.
[39:31.57]Not a bonsai tree.
[39:32.95]Not a bonsai... No, it's a bonsai tree.
[39:35.21]Bonsai.
[39:35.79]Bonsai tree.
[39:38.19]Bonsai tree.
[39:41.76]Bonzi buddy tree.
[39:44.62]Alright, let me zoom this shit in.
[39:45.88]Because you guys are... You're split at the bottom.
[40:00.05]You're not supposed to see that.
[40:02.23]Don't you guys know that when a graphic is on screen, it's like magic?
[40:07.73]Alright.
[40:08.65]Choose.
[40:10.27]Wisely.
[40:13.32]They crepify, for fuck's sake.
[40:15.42]Gray, I can't, I cannot influence anything.
[40:18.53]They've chosen to be down here.
[40:36.78]Okay.
[40:39.77]I can't click poison over, guys.
[40:42.57]We don't have enough points.
[40:48.66]Alright.
[40:50.90]Spreading ourselves out.
[40:54.42]We're going to make our own Diablo.

[41:42.97]It's actually going to come down to can my mini me Diablo beat actual Diablo?
[41:54.25]You think that's a joke?
[41:56.49]It's not.
[41:58.97]Where are the stats going?
[42:02.54]Oh, wait, before I do that, just so you can get a clear indicator, here's what the stats look like right now.

[42:12.12]Oh, I absolutely will.
[42:14.39]When we open this last seal, I am not going to get any more skeletons, because they're all going to instantly explode.
[42:20.85]The presence of Diablo is going to kill every single skeleton.
[42:24.15]So it's Vik and Fireman versus Diablo.

[46:51.97]Okay, put a portal here.
[46:57.60]Guys, you gotta remember, you're going... You're behind people that like sold their soul to the devil for like a pack of gum.
[47:05.96]You know, people say this shit all the time.
[47:07.14]Like, oh, I'd sell my soul for a fucking hamburger right now.
[47:10.70]Now, 17 years later, you pop up at me.
[47:13.24]People sell their soul for all kinds of fucking crazy shit.
[47:18.83]How do you think the guy from fucking... How do you think the guy from Popeye died?
[47:23.32]The burger guy.
[47:25.64]He sold his soul to Del for a fucking hamburger.
[47:28.06]What was his name?
[47:30.42]Tootie?
[47:30.78]What was that guy's name?
[47:35.20]Wimpy.
[47:36.42]Wimpy.
[47:44.99]His name was Shitty.
[47:49.20]By the way, I feel like I stole that joke.
[47:53.24]Anybody else feel that?
[47:55.16]Like I feel like somebody's made that joke somewhere.
[47:57.74]You know what I mean?
[47:59.48]Like, oh, he's like, Wimpy sold his soul to the devil for a hamburger.
[48:03.86]That's like an easy joke to do.
[48:06.54]That's probably something.
[48:07.52]I'm sure it happened.
[48:15.37]Alright.
[48:16.41]Once I open these seals, this is it.
[48:23.25]Clown anxiety.
[48:24.31]Oh, God.

[48:31.56]He's gonna say the line.
[48:36.00]Here we go.
[48:37.90]Let's open this one first, because we're gonna get ported on.
[48:41.88]Okay.
[48:45.36]You ready?
[48:45.74]Here we go.
[48:54.88]Oh, it's this motherfucker.

[48:56.14]Get in there, fireman.
[49:02.12]No way.
[49:15.16]Alright.
[49:18.20]This is my Vic fund.
[49:24.51]At least I have money in the Vic Fund.
[49:28.83]We just keep bringing them back.
[49:34.03]Oh boy.
[49:42.22]We're going to walk there again.
[49:44.44]From here.
[49:46.56]Because I need another army.
[49:50.62]I knew this was going to happen.
[50:00.21]I can't go back in that portal.
[50:02.65]Because the portal will be surrounded.
[50:06.09]What's my opinion on Warcraft Reforged?
[50:11.50]It would have been nice if it was actually reforged.
[50:21.00]Warcraft refunded.
[50:28.19]For some reason, I don't know why Blizzard thinks this, but
[50:31.50]When you open up the oven to check on your pizza, it's not the same as making a video game.
[50:46.63]What the fuck does that mean?
[50:57.61]Yo... No, I was going somewhere.
[51:00.46]If you...
[51:02.55]Re-heat?
[51:03.59]No, I fucked it up.
[51:05.35]Uh, sorry.
[51:08.67]Oh.
[51:11.68]Fuck, is this not doing on?
[51:14.24]Uh, I meant to say, is, uh, reheating your leftovers is not the same thing as making a new pizza.
[51:19.40]Fucking, why did I take it off?
[51:28.21]Alright, let's, wait, no, no, don't go over there yet.

[54:05.86]I don't have enough mana for this ship.
[54:25.51]Alright.
[54:27.23]You want another strategy?
[54:30.33]It's got to be Vic.

[54:51.94]God.
[54:57.98]I need a gem.
[54:59.66]I need chipped gems.
[55:04.32]Let me just try... Here, you take this helmet.
[55:10.83]You take this.
[55:12.47]He's got 75% fire resist.
[55:15.61]Okay?
[55:17.85]I'm gonna just... Let's see how long he lives.
[55:27.78]This is a test.
[55:31.58]Alright, Vik.
[55:34.38]He needs lightning?
[55:35.00]I mean, he's got 58% lightning.
[55:38.86]Alright, come on, Vik.
[55:41.10]Let's go.
[55:41.42]I'm just gonna try to keep you alive.
[55:43.86]Give Vik the controller.
[55:45.48]Vik, turn on your, uh, blessing, please.
[55:47.05]Are you really gonna be the guy in the raid that doesn't have his blessings on and shit?
[55:51.25]Come on, do I have to remind everybody?
[55:53.35]Why do I, as the raid leader, have to constantly tell people how to use their own moves?
[56:20.52]I have an idea.
[56:26.90]Iron Golem.
[56:30.17]Iron Golem returns 225% damage back to the attacker.
[56:36.87]We're just gonna have Diablo kill this guy and hurt himself over and over again.
[56:45.40]Let's test the theory.
[56:54.61]Is it working?
[57:02.39]holy shit it kind of worked holy shit it kind of worked what do I I don't leave run oh that was a ton of damage get me out get me out port he's gonna chase me down here port here this is fine do you see the damage that took like alright that's the plan I'm just gonna buy like 10 swords what's the cheapest sword I can possibly buy
[57:30.87]Alright.
[57:32.13]Just buy all the cheap shit.
[57:40.13]Get your helmet back.
[57:45.83]Alright.
[57:46.33]I'm gonna get the helmet back.
[57:47.91]I need a socket.

[57:50.45]Okay.
[57:51.81]Helmet.
[57:52.05]I got the helmet back.
[57:53.65]And I'm gonna get a socket shield and just put rubies in it.
[57:56.87]You sell those?
[58:02.73]Fire defense?
[58:04.11]On any of these?
[58:04.59]I don't care.
[58:08.81]I will wear, like, my big brother's clothes.
[58:12.09]Look at this.
[58:13.17]30%.
[58:19.02]I don't care about... Yeah, just put it on.
[58:21.12]I can give this back.
[58:26.38]I'll put that to good use.
[58:34.70]Act 1.
[58:35.58]Good call.
[58:38.18]But Diablo's gonna start.
[58:39.38]It doesn't matter if he regens.
[58:40.40]We're just gonna sacrifice like 30 Iron Golems.
[58:44.32]Okay, we're just gonna riddle trash all over the arena so I can always revive an Iron Golem no matter where I am.
[58:58.08]I'm gonna just back up a dump truck and dump the whole thing into the arena.
[59:01.24]Oh, hi there.
[59:06.99]This is so stupid.
[59:09.25]What a joke.
[59:13.24]This is 60... I don't have enough money?
[59:15.52]Oh no, rub.
[59:17.72]Let's sell this.
[59:36.39]Use daggers?
[59:37.19]Well, I bought them all.
[59:51.60]I can't.
[59:57.83]I already have...
[60:08.52]Okay, let's go.
[60:10.64]Move the potions.
[60:19.60]So, we need a distraction for a minute.
[60:24.00]That should be enough for a little while.
[60:26.84]You're triggering me with your inventory management.
[60:32.14]You know what a cellar spider is?
[60:33.24]If you don't know, look it up.
[60:41.72]That's how I roll.
[60:46.96]Holy fuck, there's only... Okay.
[60:51.52]So, we need to do one of these right now.
[60:55.92]Here's one.
[61:03.43]Alright, I need to do this.
[61:05.63]Let's start riddling this area.
[61:10.12]Like, I'm gonna say this is the trash zone right here.
[61:12.34]Okay.
[61:28.73]Let's go.
[61:31.94]Did he hurt himself?
[61:41.49]Get in there!
[61:52.32]It's kind of working.
[61:53.36]I just have to stay alive.
[61:55.36]Oh, fuck.
[61:56.59]Oh, fuck!
[62:05.01]He's almost at the O.
[62:28.46]That's it.
[62:28.72]I have nothing left.
[62:30.70]What's he at?
[62:31.53]He's past EO.
[62:33.67]Get me out of here.
[63:04.47]I don't... It's too big!
[63:22.06]Too big, whatever.
[63:24.68]Any more?
[63:25.54]Little ones.
[63:25.92]That's good, that's good.
[63:27.48]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[68:19.00]He can't, he can't hit him.
[68:41.53]Oh, don't run down here.

[73:23.22]Up the trash.
[73:26.84]Good.
[73:27.52]Okay, let's go.

[74:12.00]That was almost a killer.
[74:19.47]Instantly killed him.
[74:20.27]It's okay.
[74:37.55]Oh my god, where's he running?
[74:45.76]Where are our trash?
[74:49.76]He's blocked the entrance.
[74:52.12]Okay, we're gonna have to do another trash run.
[74:56.70]I'm going right in that portal after I cast this.
[75:02.96]Okay, go.
[75:08.77]There's more trash here?
[75:09.67]Where?
[75:09.87]I don't see any.

[76:58.09]Trash... Trash heap number 60.
[77:01.57]Good job.

[77:20.89]I think he found the trash.
[77:26.38]He's wanted.
[77:27.50]He's wanted.
[77:28.10]Hold on.
[77:28.52]Wait a minute.
[77:29.34]Hold on.
[77:29.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[77:53.34]This is a bad idea.
[77:54.48]This is a really bad idea.
[77:55.70]It's three damage, guys.
[77:57.12]Nope, don't care.
[77:58.49]I'm living.
[78:03.37]My heart just exploded.
[78:04.75]I thought I was dead.
[78:20.52]He still has too much health.
[78:27.90]Oh my god!
[78:28.70]No, no, no!
[78:29.82]Who cares about jokes?
[78:30.86]Give me up!
[78:31.34]Help me!
[78:38.37]Trash monster number... That was the loudest I think of... That was the most actual real scream I've done in a long time.
[78:46.67]That was like I was about to get into a car accident.
[79:07.73]No uniques, game sucks.
[79:14.35]Somebody said that was the stupidest fucking way I've ever seen somebody kill Diablo.
[79:29.48]I worked for it.
[79:33.87]He's dead.
[79:36.07]Wow, my title can change now.
[79:40.01]Hey, look guys.
[79:42.76]You see how it saved the run?
[79:45.54]You guys put six points into Iron Golem for some reason.
[79:56.94]Here he is.
[80:01.37]He was returning.
[80:05.18]225% damage done returned.
[80:08.24]That's pretty good.
[80:12.61]That's pretty good.
[80:16.01]Dude, trash pile 69 for the rumble.
[80:24.18]Alright, well we did it.
[80:26.00]We can move on to Act 5.

[81:21.84]Act 5, D2 is awesome.
[81:22.64]Thank you, hero.
[81:39.38]Praise be to the light.
[81:40.84]Praise be to the light.
[81:42.81]You have accomplished the impossible.
[81:45.75]Diablo and Mephisto have been packaged back into the black abyss that spawned them, and the corrupted Soulstones are no more.
[81:53.53]However, while you were fighting here, Bael remained behind in the mortal realm, building an army of hellish minions.
[82:02.04]yes we're going to the barbarian homeland Ben eleanor gave the bits by the way I just wanted to wait till that was he's done talking uh Ben eleanor gave 5 000 bits thank you Ben seriously
[82:26.14]It's never, never necessary to ever give this channel these amounts of huge dollar signs.
[82:34.48]Thanks.
[82:35.64]I hope you can afford it, and I'm glad that you think it's worth paying for.
[82:39.86]Thank you.
[82:40.82]They say, hey, Jerma, hope you're doing well.
[82:42.00]It's been a while since I've caught one of your streams.
[82:43.42]Thanks for being amazing.
[82:47.17]Thanks.
[82:47.71]I appreciate it.
[82:50.39]Scam wink?
[82:51.15]Ah, it's already been paid for like five times, so.
[83:00.81]Backpack.
[83:03.18]I'm not talking about my backpack.
[83:05.50]Let's identify these.
[83:06.70]They might be good.
[83:11.58]No.
[83:13.82]Yes.
[83:17.34]Not an assassin.
[83:27.89]Well.
[83:29.61]We did it.
[83:31.87]Oops.
[83:33.14]All it took was just buying up everybody's trash.
[83:38.52]Let's repair.
[83:42.04]And let's watch one of my favorite cutscenes.
[83:47.42]Here we go.
[83:49.48]Here we go.
[84:40.18]The gates of Sessaron have been closed for eons.
[84:43.20]They will not move, however you now.
[85:36.41]Bale.
[85:39.01]Bale!
[86:00.73]The gates of Sessharon have stood for eons beyond remembrance, and you shall not breach them now.
[86:08.54]Remove your foul demons from our lands.
[86:12.04]We stand on the side of light, and you shall not be allowed to reach Mount Ariad.
[86:19.85]And that which you seek will not be yours.
[86:42.79]I shall take your position into consideration.
[87:27.78]Well, it seems your terms are not acceptable.
[87:58.38]Bail.
[88:00.22]Here we are in Horogris.
[88:04.04]Best act.
[88:05.32]Best act.
[88:06.42]Best boss.
[88:07.50]Best villain.
[88:12.81]My voice is low?
[88:13.69]Oh, it's because the audio was incredibly loud.
[88:17.17]Best laugh.
[88:18.37]Best enough.
[88:21.82]Alright.
[88:25.60]We're in Act 5!
[88:28.28]Hooray!
[88:28.74]Currently under siege.
[88:33.61]Best salad.
[88:35.53]Worst build.
[88:37.09]I, Mala, welcome you to Harogath, the last stronghold of order on Mount Aureate.
[88:43.13]You have come to the right place.
[88:45.53]I have to say, that was like a 9 out of 10.
[88:47.57]Enough.
[88:47.93]It was.
[88:49.69]The Vale has laid waste to our mountain and its denizens.
[88:53.53]His minions continue to attack our town, while Qualkech and his men have proven helpless to stop them.
[89:01.07]Bael is still out on the mountain looking for something.
[89:04.98]Bael is looking for something.
[89:06.72]The world stone.
[89:11.38]Look, it's Otto.
[89:15.28]That's music.
[89:25.09]First things first.
[89:27.11]Let's...
[89:28.75]We're going to say goodbye to our Iron Golem.
[89:34.35]He's very, very good.
[89:36.21]But it's time to replace with our Fire Golem.
[89:43.04]Fire Golem just does more damage.
[89:45.76]Rest easy, trash number 69.
[89:50.72]He's ready to be swept up into the great dumpster.
[89:58.04]Out behind the chilies.
[90:01.61]Goodbye.
[90:04.84]Farewell.
[90:13.00]Shank the Overseer.
[90:14.14]This is coming up here.
[90:15.70]Wait, is this Diablo or Warcraft?
[90:18.97]What's the difference?
[90:19.83]What is this?
[90:20.11]So let me help you out here.
[90:34.88]Diablo 1 and 2 way better than Warcraft 3.
[90:39.56]Here it is.
[90:39.96]Diablo 1 and 2 better for me than Warcraft 3.
[90:44.70]Warcraft 1 and 2 way worse to me than Diablo 1 and 2.
[90:50.16]Diablo 3 way worse than Warcraft 1 and 2.
[90:52.40]They kind of switch.
[90:54.56]They swap.
[90:57.49]What's wrong?
[91:00.01]I mean, I have to disagree.
[91:01.27]Diablo II is better than Warcraft 3.
[91:02.67]I'm just going to say it.
[91:05.55]Head to head, pound for pound, I think Diablo II is a better game.
[91:16.88]Although I'm biased because this is like, I love this game.
[91:19.72]I love this franchise.
[91:20.56]So, I'm pretty biased.
[91:23.72]Why is there just a shield in here?
[91:24.74]Alright, stop the siege by killing Shank the Overseer in the Bloody Foothills.
[91:31.22]We're gonna have an army.
[91:32.97]This should be pretty easy.
[91:36.76]I use that term pretty loosely.
[91:40.32]I do want to get Vic back.
[91:45.34]Oh, well, well.
[91:46.72]I remember this guy.
[91:47.68]This guy.
[91:48.32]Spoiler alert.
[91:48.96]This guy.
[91:51.20]Ah, a necromancer.
[91:53.78]While I admire your courage in seeking out the darker side of magic, we really have little need of your skills.
[92:01.77]The battle will turn soon enough without your medley.
[92:05.96]We're both necromancers, man.
[92:08.50]Come on.
[92:08.74]A lot of lore here.
[92:10.20]I really do implore you to buy this.
[92:11.94]No, I don't.
[92:42.89]Alright, get him!
[92:48.35]Oh, I need Vic, I need Vic.
[92:52.33]Uh, the reason why I say this is because the game doesn't really run that well.
[92:54.61]You gotta do a bunch of bullshit to get it to run.
[92:57.34]Blizzard does this really great thing where they sell a game for $20 on their official website.
[93:01.56]And, like, the game can barely run on, like, Windows 7 computers.
[93:07.04]It's cool.
[93:07.40]It's really cool.
[93:09.02]And, like, you have to download fucking third-party apps to get it to run the way it was supposed to run.
[93:15.53]Uh, $20, by the way.
[93:17.87]On the official Blizzard shop.
[93:23.60]Uh, where is, uh, there it gets, there it is.
[93:39.18]There you are.
[93:41.76]We... Alright, this is where we have to... No, no, no.
[93:45.08]This is very important.
[93:47.67]Do we trade Vic's combat aura for a super strong, heavy melee damage barbarian? ...
[94:07.29]The bar yeah that yeah Vic just makes all the skeletons stronger Barbarians are cool though.
[94:15.78]Just fun to watch him use two hands and swing and shit.
[94:18.26]I love it Alright, let's get the army back
[94:34.26]They're not going to instantaneously die now.
[94:41.23]Also, I'm thinking of... Thinking of doing a couple of Mephisto runs.
[94:49.17]Thinking about it.
[94:55.45]We need better gear.
[94:57.20]I need it.
[94:57.58]Alright, after Shank the Overseer, we're going to do at least one.
[95:01.44]At least one.
[95:05.81]Mephisto.
[95:07.55]We're gonna go open up the treasure box that is Mephisto's body.
[95:13.86]I need all the help I can get.
[95:20.78]This is true.
[95:27.71]I need a key.
[95:28.37]I got rid of my keys, right.
[95:32.93]We'll get in there, guys.
[95:33.67]Come on.
[95:52.85]Don't go up here too far.
[95:55.03]I get overwhelmed if I go up too far.
[95:58.02]I want a better spear for him.
[95:59.66]Everybody needs better stuff.
[96:02.25]He's got a unique, but it's an old unique.
[96:05.23]Level 17.
[96:05.41]11 to 27.
[96:05.51]Lifesteal.
[96:06.05]I mean, it's just old.
[96:07.50]How old is he?
[96:07.96]29.
[96:08.58]We've got to get him something better than that.
[96:27.09]Lifesteal is really good for tanking.
[96:28.51]Yeah, it is.
[96:33.47]It is very good.
[96:40.98]What do you get for doing this?
[96:41.94]I forget.
[96:42.56]I think you actually get a rune word.
[96:44.48]Yeah, it's like growl or growl.
[96:50.95]And you get Kim the Gifted Prize.
[96:53.45]We have not gone to McDonald's.
[96:57.92]I have not given 10 Community Fries to Kim yet.
[97:01.50]We have to go to McDonald's.
[97:02.54]The next time we go, I will.
[97:17.44]He hates kids Everything has to be hated Terrible Skeleton friends are starting to die faster now.
[97:41.65]I don't like it.
[97:43.35]We need better stuff
[97:48.78]I'm definitely going on at least one physical run.
[97:51.02]We need at least one more unique, one more set.
[97:53.60]Pretty good.
[97:55.46]Arm.
[98:02.88]Meh.
[98:20.21]What free full set do you get when you hit max level?
[98:27.06]Well, that's very interesting.
[98:33.98]You don't.
[98:40.68]Come according goblin.
[98:42.80]The names you haven't seen yet.
[98:51.26]Ooh, a wand.
[98:54.06]You know what?
[98:54.40]That's the problem with Diablo 3 now, and Diablo 3 in general, is it was never about the journey.
[99:02.71]It was about the grind.
[99:08.11]It was just get max level fast as possible, get set to do max level rifts, and just grind rifts until you have your gem is maxed the fuck out.
[99:24.23]And I guess you could argue that during this game's heyday, that the cow level was the same thing.
[99:31.57]But even when I first played through Diablo 3 and Reaper, it just felt like a get-to-the-grind, not necessarily kill Diablo.
[99:47.81]Especially considering what they did with the Nephilim Rifts.
[99:49.65]Like, it was just... Log on and just watch white and yellow numbers explode on your screen.
[99:57.35]And that's it.
[100:04.58]Here comes a three-hour video essay.
[100:09.08]Oh, no, it's... Hey, there's Decrepify.
[100:11.92]A lot of cold resist.
[100:14.10]I should hold on to this.
[100:17.82]Ooh!
[100:23.30]Magic?
[100:23.60]Fine.
[100:27.44]You're gonna have a video essay with only- A YouTube video essay that's three hours that has 14,000 views.
[100:35.73]Why is that so specific?
[100:38.65]That's so specific.
[100:51.50]That's all video essays.
[100:54.62]Save the Barbarian, don't let him die.
[101:13.61]Grand Charm.
[101:14.21]Come on, have it be a good one.
[101:19.26]Shit.
[101:20.70]Dog shit.
[101:22.54]Just dog shit.
[101:31.39]Oh my god, how bad.
[101:32.91]One to maximum damage?
[101:37.55]That's... This is little brother levels of bad.
[101:41.10]Your little brother would have this on.
[101:43.42]And he'd be like level 60, and he'd still have it on.
[101:55.78]That's a... I forgot I had jewelry slots.
[102:01.04]I picked that up already identified.
[102:04.60]And it went immediately into the slot.
[102:07.82]I didn't even put it there.
[102:16.03]This way, this way, this way.
[102:17.39]I think I'm almost at the top.
[102:18.11]Getting there.
[102:20.45]Alright, slot on.
[102:29.62]Alright, gotta get in the middle.
[102:32.50]Oh, he leveled up.
[102:33.02]Level 30.
[102:37.18]What the fuck?
[102:37.72]It's not in my inventory.
[102:39.08]Why?
[102:39.62]Where is it?
[102:40.96]Where'd it go?
[102:41.56]I think it also has a video essay incoming.
[102:59.68]The reason why I had so much fun with this game was just miserably failing characters.
[103:07.00]Like trying to do a vengeance paladin.
[103:09.88]It was just... You could mess up.
[103:16.76]You could screw the fuck up in Diablo II and maybe you could still try to make it work.
[103:23.24]D3, it's just... You made a barbarian, and then... I don't like this, but we switch it, switch it, switch it.
[103:29.13]I can just use this one.
[103:29.87]Who cares?
[103:30.21]Like, there were no stakes to your character.
[103:35.81]It was just... Here's everything.
[103:38.18]Use whatever you want.
[103:47.51]Alright, here we go.
[103:49.49]Video Essay 2.
[103:50.09]Alright, hold on.
[103:51.85]Shank's up here.
[103:53.81]Shank the Overseer.
[103:55.41]Every time I played this game when I was younger, I always had to say that out loud.
[103:58.54]Every time I got here, no matter how many times I've been here.
[104:01.06]I would go, Shank the Overseer.
[104:04.08]Every time.
[104:04.44]I just did it again.
[104:06.78]God, I remember when I was younger.
[104:10.38]Uh, Iron Man's gonna die.
[104:11.57]This is a traffic jam.
[104:15.48]I need you up here, fireman.
[104:25.17]I think these people can explode.
[104:26.71]I don't want to end in here.
[104:28.37]There he is.
[104:32.81]Speaking of... Careful.
[104:37.39]Nothing.
[104:38.73]Alright, kill them.
[104:39.59]Yup, they can explode.
[104:40.71]This could end real fast.
[104:43.80]One wrong explosion.
[104:50.81]Alright, let's get in.
[104:58.98]Kill him.
[105:05.14]Shank.
[105:08.02]Burn.
[105:09.28]This dude getting ganked.
[105:25.68]Larzoc has the ward.
[105:26.96]My, my.
[105:29.38]What a messy little demon.
[105:36.01]Oh yeah, for doing this he will put a socket.
[105:38.65]This is one of the best rewards in the game.
[105:41.13]First playthrough... First playthrough Larry.
[105:42.35]First playthrough Andy, whatever.
[105:43.39]Oh cool, add sockets!
[106:04.41]I could use another one in here.
[106:05.73]And you just waste it completely.
[106:16.58]I'm not going to use this.
[106:17.88]Even with the cold resist.
[106:19.18]It's not very good.
[106:22.25]Maybe I'll hold on to it.
[106:23.19]Alright, we've got some management to do.
[106:30.17]We've got some management to do here.
[106:37.51]A lot of management.
[106:41.61]Oh, boy.
[106:42.13]I have to sell this.
[106:45.89]It's just... It's worthless to me.
[106:50.54]I was keeping this to... Why was I keeping this?
[106:52.62]I was making a rune ward, right?
[106:57.24]Am... Something fell?
[107:04.70]Holy fuck, that's a lot of resistance.
[107:08.30]Get rid of the extra tier.
[107:09.30]Eth.
[107:11.77]Eld.
[107:12.05]Eth.
[107:13.67]Eth.
[107:13.97]Get rid of it.
[107:15.75]Eth.
[107:17.33]These things drop all the time.
[107:18.83]Ral.
[107:19.39]Ral.
[107:19.85]Ral.
[107:20.27]Get rid of it.
[107:27.52]These flawed diamonds.
[107:30.18]Get rid of them.
[107:31.20]I just don't.
[107:31.66]I'm not.
[107:32.22]Get rid of them.
[107:33.56]They're taking up too much space.
[107:34.64]Anything flawed is out.
[107:38.93]At this stage.
[107:44.19]We're keeping... Complete or higher only.
[107:48.12]Alright, let's dump all this shit.
[108:04.19]Okay.
[108:07.45]Bye.
[108:11.84]Organize this.
[108:14.60]We can make a flawless.
[108:15.56]I must have enough to make a perfect flawless amethyst.
[108:21.14]Always good.
[108:27.75]Still have the leg.
[108:28.57]Thull?
[108:29.63]If I have more than one thull, I do get rid of it.
[108:44.04]Alright.
[108:46.00]That's a lot of lightning resist.
[108:47.09]That's why I'm keeping it.
[108:47.89]I need a rune word.
[108:49.07]What was the word?
[108:51.39]What was the rune word for this?
[108:55.33]Fire alarm?
[109:01.82]In all my years of playing Diablo II.
[109:06.54]Decades of time.
[109:08.54]I have never once thought that it was a smoke detector.
[109:18.97]Now I do, and now I can never unhear that.
[109:25.94]Uh, but what was the word?
[109:27.04]What was it?
[109:27.42]It was amn something thul.
[109:33.80]Anyone remember?
[109:34.94]Amn ral thul.
[109:35.96]I have it, right?
[109:38.22]Am Ralph-o.
[109:44.15]Am Ralph-o.
[109:47.13]Oh, right, because I was waiting to see if I could find something better than a war sword.
[109:53.51]We just say fuck it and do it.
[109:54.43]Who cares?
[110:02.30]I mean, war sword's pretty good.
[110:05.80]Am Ralph-o.
[110:15.73]I'm doing it.
[110:19.72]It's Amnur, I'll follow, right?
[110:20.72]Let me just look.
[110:21.30]I want to make sure I got this right.
[110:22.38]I would hate to have this completely wrong.
[110:35.69]Okay.
[110:38.33]It's called King's Grace, right?
[110:44.33]Amrothal.
[110:45.33]Yep.
[110:45.83]Alright, you ready?
[110:46.41]I don't have enough strength to use this, but I probably will eventually.
[110:50.87]Amrothal.
[110:54.29]Boom.
[110:56.81]King's Grace.
[110:57.53]16 to 40.
[111:05.36]A huge amount of attack rating.
[111:06.58]Tons of damage to demons.
[111:09.41]Tons of damage to undead.
[111:12.27]Adds 5 to 30 fire.
[111:13.79]Adds 3 to 14 cold.
[111:14.97]Tons of health stolen per hit.
[111:19.99]Pretty good.
[111:21.98]Pretty good.
[111:30.28]Some of you may have joined the stream very recently and probably thinking to yourself...
[111:35.31]Is this guy crazy?
[111:36.15]Why are you doing this on a necromancer?
[111:40.09]Well, it's because I... I don't have any moves.
[111:47.88]I have teeth, too.
[111:50.12]I don't have any abilities.
[111:56.05]Quick, do a flush.
[111:58.83]That's stupid.
[112:00.39]Alright, back up.
[112:02.89]I have... Alright, let's move.
[112:13.01]The hard wall?
[112:14.03]I'm glad I beat Diablo.
[112:16.40]The actual wall.
[112:18.46]The true wall.
[112:20.34]Is going to be the Ancients.
[112:21.28]If you don't know what the Ancients are, the Ancients are... It's a boss encounter that you cannot leave.
[112:33.27]If you leave, it resets.
[112:35.17]You have to do it in one shot.
[112:36.77]You cannot lose.
[112:42.45]So... And that's... Unfortunately, right at the end of the act.
[112:52.39]So, we're not going to know for certain.
[112:56.25]Oh, I was going to do Mephisto.
[112:58.87]Yeah, let's do that.
[112:59.39]Let's go kill Mephisto.
[113:11.08]Not that good.
[113:15.90]Junk.
[113:18.10]And also junk.
[113:19.40]Alright, let's go do Mephisto.
[113:22.90]Let's pull this crew.
[113:29.77]Durance of Hate level 2.
[113:30.91]Let's go.
[113:31.35]I already know where it is.
[113:33.55]Glorious.
[113:39.61]It's up here.
[113:46.39]I wonder if this would be any easier.
[113:49.45]Now that I'm 10 levels higher.
[113:52.79]What?
[113:53.57]10?
[113:53.59]15?
[113:53.87]Am I 30?
[113:54.49]30?
[113:54.75]Yeah.
[113:55.09]What was I?
[113:56.25]I was like level 22 when I was here?
[114:04.48]24 maybe?
[114:05.82]It's still probably gonna be hard.
[114:08.08]Somebody's blocking the door.
[114:09.02]Alright.
[114:13.42]Are you getting out of the fucking doorway?
[114:16.81]Get out of the doorway!
[114:17.53]I have Fireman here to protect me.
[114:24.19]Yes, I do.
[114:26.03]I'm gonna die to Mephisto.
[114:36.94]I'm only level 30.
[114:37.66]It's not like, um... It's very possible.
[114:40.80]I have to be careful.
[114:46.04]You didn't drop shit.
[114:48.92]This desk is falling over here.
[114:56.98]There we go.
[115:08.59]Okay.
[115:11.73]You guys are still pretty dangerous.
[115:19.90]That just fucking hurt a lot.
[115:27.75]Don't run and pull.
[115:28.89]What are you guys thinking?
[115:31.57]You're just going to go pull Mephisto?
[115:32.75]You're going to get us all killed.
[115:33.87]Alright.
[115:43.46]Mirror Mephisto.
[115:50.72]Get in there.
[115:54.40]Yeah, this is going fine.
[115:55.78]I heard him.
[116:00.16]Come on, Fire Golem.
[116:02.60]Stay alive.
[116:03.60]Make it clean.
[116:14.83]And... something good.
[116:18.21]Uh...
[116:19.44]I think I already have those boots.
[116:28.84]Oh, no I don't.
[116:33.53]Saigon's sabot.
[116:36.11]Coldest is 40.
[116:36.77]Not enough strength.
[116:39.15]Do I have anything else from Saigon's?
[116:42.95]It's very fast.
[116:47.15]I don't think so.
[117:00.19]Now you can finally go kill Durial.
[117:01.95]Yeah.
[117:02.15]Alright, that was fun.
[117:03.83]Do it again.
[117:18.47]No, I have Cath- I have Cath- Cathans.
[117:21.85]These normal little early game sets though, if you get two or three pieces, it actually is really good.
[117:29.30]They have a lot of good bonuses.
[117:32.62]Let's start from the beginning.
[117:33.50]I'm just trying to sell the cube.
[117:37.91]I'm glad you can't do that.
[117:40.79]Parents of hate level two.
[117:43.31]Again.
[117:49.71]No, don't pick up blood.
[117:57.62]My army.
[118:03.84]We're back.
[118:08.07]Back in business.
[118:09.73]Let's go.
[118:21.27]I'm going to hit her in the head.
[118:26.20]Do I have potions?
[118:28.22]I'm going to get caught up here.
[118:31.34]I'm going to get potions.
[118:36.30]That hurts.
[118:37.56]Yeah, I need potions.
[118:43.62]Even if they're shitty, I don't care.
[118:47.27]I'll just get the good ones.
[118:52.06]Just get the good ones.
[119:04.57]The best part of this game is that it is not Warcraft Remastered.
[119:07.55]Uh, I guess I follow you.
[119:23.93]I think I pick up what you're putting down here.
[119:32.20]Reforged.
[119:32.98]Reforged.
[119:34.10]It's not... Hey, it wasn't... It's not a remaster.
[119:38.68]That's where you guys got it all wrong.
[119:40.16]It was reforged.
[119:42.66]That means that's a made-up term that it could mean anything.
[119:55.26]It's not Warcraft 3 remade or remake, remastered.
[120:04.80]No, it's re-forged.
[120:06.46]I thought you guys got that when we announced it.
[120:13.48]Oh, by the way, you can never play the original ever again.
[120:18.41]We had to, we reforged the damn thing!
[120:25.27]We didn't teleport, did we?
[120:32.22]Get over here.
[120:39.79]Oh, fireman died.
[120:40.93]Poor fireman.
[120:43.61]He gave himself.
[120:47.86]Again, let's go.
[120:49.04]Hey, Mephisto.
[120:51.06]Remember us?
[120:52.26]We're here.
[120:52.82]We're here for the diamonds.
[120:55.23]We're here for the jewels.
[121:00.57]I just get to watch.
[121:27.56]not even worth picking up alright we're gonna do it five times this will be number three and then we'll go we'll do the next quest in act five we'll do this five times
[121:57.36]Man, times that I wish I was a sorceress.
[122:00.76]One of them is right now.
[122:03.62]It's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[122:10.07]Exit game.
[122:11.51]Enter game.
[122:12.91]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[122:17.93]Exit game.
[122:19.47]Enter game.
[122:21.03]Alright, I need people.
[122:33.38]Alright, let's go.
[122:38.65]Careful.
[122:40.35]Easy.
[122:47.01]The mages just died so quickly.
[122:51.43]These mages are getting beat up.
[122:54.88]You guys dead?
[123:04.55]Alright, come on guys.
[123:05.69]Clean it up a little bit here.
[123:07.03]This is embarrassing.
[123:07.95]It's the same hardcore run.
[123:18.20]It is.
[123:18.68]It is still hardcore.
[123:22.04]I have not died yet on this character.
[123:28.06]All that could change in an instant.
[123:38.21]Okay.
[123:39.23]Let's go!
[123:44.83]Look, I'm helping this time.
[123:51.38]Okay, so I just dropped him in the meteor.
[124:11.84]This is getting a little hairy.
[124:16.24]Not clean.
[124:17.80]Not clean.
[124:25.41]Heavy boots.
[124:26.55]Boots again?
[124:30.29]Sanders.
[124:34.17]40%.
[124:34.19]100% attack rating.
[124:36.47]He's actually kind of good.
[124:39.83]Sanders Rip Rap.
[124:43.73]These are really good, actually.
[124:47.60]Do I have anything else from Sanders?
[124:54.56]No.
[124:56.44]I'm gonna put these on.
[124:57.10]40% faster run.
[124:59.83]Bunch of strengthened decks.
[125:03.53]Oh my god, I fucking vroom.
[125:07.21]Vroom.
[125:14.45]Don't I already have?
[125:15.27]Yeah, I have stealth too.
[125:20.11]I can do this faster now, yeah.
[125:22.19]Why am I not opening the chest back here?
[125:23.61]Why has nobody corrected me?
[125:27.30]Where are all the Diablo II veterans in here that should be correcting me to get the chest back here?
[125:31.88]Because it could be unique.
[125:43.05]Two more.
[125:53.20]I remember being like a Sunday afternoon and I was on my like 40th Mephisto run I had a fresh Mountain Dew Code Red I was just in my element It was just so much fun
[126:25.46]I was in my element.
[126:26.26]Somebody would come into the room, spam a Diablo II item scam website ten times, and then instantly leave.
[126:36.57]Ugh.
[126:38.27]Those are the days.
[126:39.01]Oh my god, don't die.
[126:48.51]Reminiscing is gonna kill me.
[126:55.88]I do, I remember.
[126:57.10]I remember having to have a password-protected private game.
[127:02.36]For every 10 seconds, a new account that was a keyboard smash name would come in and talk about how much percent off their wind forces were.
[127:23.76]I remember also, and God bless my mother, God bless my mother, because I remember being like 15 and wanting to buy a wind force.
[127:45.16]And I was trying to explain to my mother why I had to have this thing.
[127:53.50]And she just shook her head and said, That is absurd.
[128:00.27]You don't need that.
[128:02.53]And I was like, no, but I do, but my character!
[128:04.99]Like, come on!
[128:13.26]And she refused to do it.
[128:16.38]Didn't matter how much I was like, no, but mom!
[128:18.40]By the way, I was 15, not like 6.
[128:20.04]So I don't know why I'm doing like a, come on, mommy voice.
[128:23.49]I was like fucking a teenager.
[128:24.73]I was like 15.
[128:26.05]I was, I was, I had to have been fucking like...
[128:46.19]Oh.
[128:47.63]No, stop, stop, stop.
[128:49.77]Stop!
[128:53.87]Where's my fire friend?
[128:57.35]Oh my god.
[128:58.30]Hold on.
[129:19.22]I just need to never talk ever again.
[129:20.72]Um... My mom... I was a teenager at the time.
[129:37.62]She told me it wasn't worth it and it was a stupid thing to do.
[129:42.14]To buy this item from the Diablo II scam website.
[129:45.64]I'm surprised you made it back on...
[129:58.36]Okay, let's kill, let's kill, let's kill.
[130:13.79]You might have a big brain.
[130:17.30]I think a Windforce... Windforce was like... Don't die.
[130:22.21]Thanks.
[130:22.35]I think a Windforce was like fucking 200 bucks or something crazy.
[130:27.53]Fuck.
[130:28.01]Ooh, wait.
[130:28.53]That's actually a head.
[130:32.01]They were expensive.
[130:33.82]They were like more than 100 bucks or something.
[130:35.30]They had to have been.
[130:35.88]I remember.
[130:36.30]Free to life tap.
[130:39.76]Oh, hooray.
[130:42.50]One more.
[130:51.94]You were a pretty stupid 15-year-old.
[130:53.60]Uh, no.
[130:57.86]The Wind Force was one of the hardest things to get in the whole game.
[131:00.07]The Wind Force was just the unobtainable.
[131:07.31]It was that one bow that was the best bow.
[131:11.63]And all it would have done would be to let me to use Strafe and kill cows faster.
[131:20.12]That's all I was doing.
[131:29.34]So in 2020 hindsight, no, it definitely was not worth it.
[131:34.38]I just wanted to be able to farm, because I wanted to find the runes.
[131:40.67]Yep, it was to be able to farm cows.
[131:42.59]Alright, this is the last one.
[131:49.12]It's 55 cents now.
[131:53.27]I would not put my credit card into a website still selling Diablo II items for 50 cents a time.
[132:11.38]I don't think that would be a good idea for me.
[132:15.82]What am I doing?
[132:19.12]I need to pet a friend.
[132:26.31]Come on, man.
[132:26.73]It's a steel.
[132:27.47]It's a wind force.
[132:30.67]Oh, fuck.
[132:37.48]I can't let this be on the tombstone.
[132:40.80]I'd rather die to the ancients than die farming Mephisto.
[132:45.90]That's embarrassing on the tombstone.
[133:08.20]They're gonna be a pain in the ass, let's kill them.
[133:12.72]Alright, let's get council number two.
[133:29.17]Your mom probably bought the wind forces and got you banned.
[133:33.09]My account wasn't banned until recently.
[133:40.22]I played Diablo II a year ago.
[133:43.96]I just installed it just to check it out for the first time in a while.
[133:54.83]What, you think my mother now did this?
[133:57.07]My mother in 2020?
[134:05.31]That'd be sort of strange.
[134:08.95]Mom trying to get my account banned.
[134:12.63]Mom got my account banned.
[134:15.45]That's like a YouTube video.
[134:21.29]Guys, my mom sold gold on my Warcraft account.
[134:25.72]Banned?! !
[134:38.11]Come on, give us a unique.
[134:40.71]This is five times.
[134:42.59]I've spun the slot machine five times.
[134:44.38]I want something.
[134:45.30]Give me something.
[134:58.85]Ouch.
[135:03.39]One more.
[135:03.65]That one didn't count.
[135:09.58]All blues doesn't matter.
[135:28.63]Jesus.
[135:31.17]That was stupid.
[135:36.81]Where are my friends?
[135:40.10]I'm about to exit the game.
[135:51.88]It's because there's a champion in here.
[136:00.72]Wait, were they two champions?
[136:13.73]Alright, well, come on.
[136:20.44]Let's go.
[136:20.82]Big co-op juke?
[136:23.40]Nice.
[136:25.60]Nice.
[136:25.92]That's what I like to see.
[136:28.76]Follow me!
[136:44.48]We'll have five.
[136:45.38]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[136:46.66]Alright, let's go.
[136:49.64]I can run faster than them.
[136:50.75]I can run faster than them.
[136:51.65]Just run.
[136:53.63]I have super speed.
[136:55.15]Use it.
[136:55.41]Alright, now slow down.
[137:02.56]Alright.
[137:23.55]Alright, do I have any healing potions?
[137:27.78]I think I have to go back to town.
[137:29.14]Alright, let's see if I can just do this without getting hit.
[137:36.52]Just don't get hit.
[137:39.30]Just don't get hit.
[137:40.18]That's all there is to it.
[137:44.46]Let me adjust the boomer belt.
[137:59.51]Justin.
[138:01.11]Okay.
[138:02.85]Justin.
[138:09.57]Terrible.
[138:12.33]Also terrible.
[138:15.57]Let's go!
[138:16.93]Last one.
[138:17.55]No matter what happens, this is it.
[138:19.13]Who cares?
[138:19.57]This will be it.
[138:21.41]No more.
[138:25.74]Everybody in.
[138:33.53]She's attacking me, don't do that.
[138:43.09]Ow.
[138:43.63]And... Unique!
[139:06.18]No, I can't do it again.
[139:08.90]No, I can't.
[139:12.37]Doesn't count.
[139:30.42]I'm just going to get there very quickly.
[139:32.26]Hold on.
[139:37.58]Maybe I should change it up.
[139:39.24]Should I do it on Dariel or something?
[139:40.32]Up the player count.
[140:00.56]yeah but that's dangerous though I'll do players uh players four you can call me coward or you want I mean it there's eight we'll do let's see if players four if I can do players four then I'll keep going
[140:32.68]And this is going to be... No, no, no, no.
[140:34.60]Bad idea.
[140:36.80]That's a really, really bad idea right now.
[140:45.16]No, no.
[140:46.04]That's so bad.
[140:46.64]Players 200.
[141:01.96]Let's go.
[141:02.22]I'm just going to try to run there.
[141:06.82]I have a no shit button.
[141:15.25]Almost there.
[141:15.99]Good.
[141:16.45]No little guys to screw it all up.
[141:27.33]There we are.
[141:27.65]Now we're going to take this slow.
[141:36.57]Can't hurt these guys here.
[141:37.53]Gonna be solely reliant on the companions, which has to be like that anyways.
[141:42.96]The footstep sounds kill me.
[141:56.43]I can't even hear footstep sounds.
[141:58.81]Oh.
[142:00.35]No, I do.
[142:00.79]Yeah, I do.
[142:01.43]It's like...
[142:06.35]Damn.
[142:14.37]I don't appreciate your passive-aggressive tone, Jerma.
[142:18.49]What the fuck are you talking about?
[142:23.47]Player's 4.
[142:42.10]Where is it?
[142:42.46]That was weird.
[142:49.58]I mean, I kind of am.
[142:51.21]Whatever.
[142:55.01]I don't think I'm that weird.
[142:57.07]I don't think I'd do anything that out of the ordinary that a normal person wouldn't do.
[143:13.27]That's what they all say.
[143:14.06]Yeah.
[143:18.26]So what?
[143:20.76]That's true.
[143:23.84]Just in case I die.
[143:24.68]I can't... I'm dead if I die.
[143:29.85]There is no coming back.
[143:30.69]Alright, I gotta heal the... I gotta heal Vic.
[143:35.97]Come back here.
[143:36.83]Make sure Vic is healed.
[143:39.97]Just stay the fuck out of the way.
[143:46.20]He's going to one by one take out every skeleton.
[143:50.54]He's going to kill... Oh, this is going to take a while.
[143:58.86]Why are you killing this guy in one hit?
[144:02.04]I need mana.
[144:11.17]Beck?
[144:13.77]You good?
[144:19.71]Just... Vic, you just do it.
[144:21.41]You'll be fine.
[144:22.07]I think he's healing himself.
[144:24.49]Use it now.
[144:32.23]He's got that pole.
[144:36.39]He goes down to... There it is.
[144:37.85]Heal him.
[144:39.54]Oh my god.
[144:40.36]He's fucking gonna die.
[144:44.22]Kill him!
[144:57.11]I can press shift.
[144:57.81]Yeah, that's right.
[145:04.26]Come on, Vik!
[145:07.40]Alright, unique!
[145:16.15]You get some bad luck here.
[145:20.20]Usually you get, like, one.
[145:25.31]Usually you get one unique.
[145:27.13]I just had to stretch for that one.
[145:30.01]That's it.
[145:30.53]I'm not doing another one.
[145:34.17]I'm not doing another Mephisto run.
[145:35.61]That's it.
[145:36.11]No more Mephisto runs.
[145:38.55]Didn't say anything about not doing an Andariel run.
[146:00.46]I run so fast.
[146:28.93]Okay, minor mana potions.
[146:32.06]Alright, get in here!
[146:32.94]And Ariel's gonna be pretty easy.
[146:38.42]Should be.
[146:58.02]Do I not have any magic find?
[146:59.71]I do not really, but it's hard to get at this stage.
[147:05.31]I could make moonward maybe with magic find on it.
[147:09.23]I think I have like 20-30%.
[147:10.73]You need to have more than 100% to really do runs efficiently.
[147:17.28]But I don't have any.
[147:19.08]I'm just trying to do it straight up.
[147:32.23]Shit, thought it was a different rune.
[147:34.39]Oh well.
[147:34.73]Alright, let's go get her!
[147:38.90]Hello!
[147:42.08]Kill her!
[147:42.74]Okay, looks like I'm already almost dead.
[147:46.70]Alright, and Dario, drop a Unique.
[147:51.92]You drop so much shit, and none of it's a Unique.
[148:06.07]It's all terrible, too.
[148:07.49]It's all, like, level 8.
[148:09.81]Level 4.
[148:13.17]Player count?
[148:13.64]Player count's at 4.
[148:16.68]I could do 8.
[148:17.82]I could do player count 8 with Andariel.
[148:20.90]You know what?
[148:21.18]Let's do that.
[148:21.56]Let's just do that.
[148:22.76]Let's do that right now.
[148:35.07]Player's 8.
[148:44.54]Definitely can do eight plays with Undariel.
[148:46.40]That shouldn't be a problem.
[148:53.71]Just to hope it's not.
[149:10.56]Easy.
[149:13.92]Okay.
[149:15.30]We're fine.
[149:17.64]Can I get in?
[149:21.38]Good.
[149:22.04]I think I'm fast.
[149:44.01]Best part about a unique, it doesn't matter what act or where in the game you find it.
[149:48.77]Well, not entirely true.
[149:51.31]But for all the normal uniques, they could drop anywhere.
[149:56.13]There are a lot of uniques that only drop in Nightmare in Hell difficulty, but it's not like I'm going to get a level 2 unique.
[150:02.00]That sucks.
[150:02.70]All uniques are pretty good.
[150:04.72]For the most part.
[150:09.12]Open the door.
[150:13.33]I mean, in normal.
[150:14.29]Like, if you're like level 20, level 30, level 40, a lot of normal uniques can carry you for, I mean, take a look.
[150:21.27]I've had this on the whole time.
[150:22.67]I've had this on since level 10.
[150:24.21]I haven't taken it off, I haven't needed to.
[150:26.83]Alright, 8 players.
[150:39.14]Remember how scared I was when I first came in here?
[150:40.78]What, did I have three skeletons?
[150:43.26]Now it's not even a challenge.
[150:46.10]Not even a challenge.
[150:47.80]Unique.
[150:53.87]If everybody in the chat says it at the same time, it might happen.
[150:56.09]Everybody in the chat say unique.
[151:04.59]Nobody.
[151:04.89]You guys didn't say it.
[151:05.87]Not enough people said it.
[151:17.66]Oh no, we failed, dude.
[151:35.15]Dude, Diablo run?
[151:36.15]Impossible.
[151:57.68]Let's go.
[152:00.08]Mephisto, done.
[152:01.58]Coming back to Act 5.
[152:02.86]Last one.
[152:06.18]Truly, truly the final one.
[152:12.47]Truly.
[152:15.23]With certainty.
[152:23.94]And then we'll do the next part of Act 5.
[152:25.44]Alright, got a full crew.
[152:35.26]Can't even go through the door.
[152:46.34]Make me laugh, E-clown?
[152:49.61]Uh...
[152:52.59]Nah.
[152:53.97]Nah.
[152:56.11]Eh.
[152:57.04]Nah.
[153:01.58]No, I don't wanna.
[153:12.11]Now.
[153:12.41]You do have to do a joke now.
[153:13.87]Nah, I don't wanna.
[153:16.17]I don't want him.
[153:20.84]No.
[153:21.36]I'm okay.
[153:24.90]Let's play a game.
[153:25.54]I gotta level up from doing this.
[153:31.74]That should be good.
[153:41.99]Gotta power up the funny crystal.
[153:54.50]Wow, that's bad.
[153:57.02]That's lower resist all.
[154:03.48]Well, he killed everybody.
[154:06.35]That's one you don't want to see.
[154:10.01]That's not a good one.
[154:11.53]You don't want to see that pop up.
[154:15.21]It's weakened.
[154:16.57]Resist lower.
[154:17.61]It sucks.
[154:20.13]Still not anything here, though.
[154:21.49]Let's go this way.
[154:24.41]It's locked.
[154:27.85]What is that?
[154:28.39]Diablo ResidentSleeper.
[154:32.36]You don't think that opening up a box is the most interesting thing you've ever seen?
[154:44.94]You mean to tell me that killing Mephisto seven times in a row is not the most exciting thing in the world?
[154:56.21]How?
[154:57.85]You get to see, like, yellow text hit the ground.
[155:00.99]What are you talking about?
[155:05.52]Alright, just keep, uh, Vigilite.
[155:16.87]Amateur hour, only seven.
[155:20.03]This should level up.
[155:22.13]Because you picked the least entertaining playstyle.
[155:35.27]I didn't pick... Probably should have put that in the title.
[155:43.52]This has nothing to do with me.
[155:52.22]No, don't die!
[155:53.34]Stay alive!
[156:11.71]Ugh.
[156:23.23]Oh well.
[156:27.35]Oh well.

[156:32.23]Level 9?
[156:34.18]Level 3?
[156:37.70]This shit is Act 3.
[156:38.62]Alright, take a look.

[167:06.06]We have strength in numbers, not individual strength.
[167:09.54]Come on, guys.
[167:12.20]Somebody kill somebody.
[167:26.61]Ooh, dammit.
[167:28.81]Thought it was gonna be good.
[167:31.63]Doesn't look very good.
[167:39.85]Oh, for the love of God, it's on players eight.
[167:41.83]It's like, why are we getting our asses kicked?
[167:53.62]This shouldn't be happening.
[167:55.02]Did it get this much harder?
[168:09.96]Alright.
[168:10.74]Now we got the whole crew.
[168:12.04]Let's go.
[168:37.57]Alright, two players.
[168:46.53]I too live in an evil demon hut.

[169:18.66]Why?
[169:19.22]Oh.
[169:20.12]Find the soldiers in the frigid highlands.
[169:22.22]So there are soldiers locked up that we have to find and help and rescue.
[169:25.72]We should rescue them.
[169:29.40]Just a battle going on.
[169:39.83]Oh, man.
[169:40.33]I can't even tell who's friend or foe right now.
[169:44.74]Alright.
[169:45.08]Time to go back.
[169:51.24]You think he realizes how dumb he is?
[169:53.14]What?
[169:54.64]By doing what?
[170:01.10]I mean, I normally might agree with you, but what are we talking about?
[170:09.77]Can I do the cow level because I've beaten Diablo?
[170:15.76]Wait.
[170:15.98]I don't think he... What do you mean he doesn't realize?
[170:19.26]What do you mean?
[170:22.80]What did I do?
[170:23.66]What happened?
[170:30.32]He needs to beat Bale?
[170:35.84]Do you... Is it Diablo or Bale?
[170:47.42]He just doesn't get it.
[170:52.72]I guess not.
[170:53.30]I need our potions.
[170:56.86]Potions, please.
[170:57.64]Potions, please.
[170:58.34]Thank you.
[171:02.86]He just doesn't get it.
[171:06.68]I wish we could make him see.
[171:08.20]Oh!
[171:30.96]46 to 121 versus 37 to 106 a shitload of everything else This can now go away I can use this but why would I he's a much better I wish we could make him understand
[172:00.10]If only we could just make him understand.
[172:02.26]See?
[172:03.46]There might be a fight there.
[172:10.06]I don't know if you can see that.
[172:28.55]I'm just going to pretend like you guys are just making a joke and you're trying to get me to go, what are you talking about?
[172:33.27]Which is what already happened, so you already did it.
[172:34.89]You've already done it.
[172:36.86]You did a good job.
[172:41.12]Saved one.
[172:42.04]I need two more.
[172:47.88]Two more soldier prisons.
[173:06.36]Difficulty.
[173:06.90]I mean, I have it on players, too.
[173:12.97]Because, I mean, it's extra experience and we can handle it.
[173:16.25]We can handle it.
[173:17.09]We haven't changed the difficulty.
[173:22.21]I changed it twice.
[173:27.32]What?
[173:28.24]Yes, I did.
[173:31.43]I forgot to slash the first time.
[173:46.04]Didn't I put it on two after four?
[173:50.20]I fixed it.
[173:51.28]At least I thought I did.
[173:54.18]You never set it to four.
[173:55.28]Okay.
[174:04.13]Still alive?
[174:04.51]Good.
[174:05.21]Another camp, right here.
[174:07.56]Let's get it.
[174:08.70]Breathe.
[174:11.30]Oh, shit.
[174:11.80]Hold on.
[174:12.76]That's death.
[174:17.94]That one's a big guy.
[174:21.42]Hey, Vic leveled up.
[174:22.56]Good.
[174:26.83]My mana is so bad.
[174:28.45]It's just bad.
[174:34.21]Alright, that's a unique.
[174:38.08]That's a... Got it.
[174:39.82]One more.
[174:40.14]Alright, kill this champion, please.
[174:57.65]I have 100% more damage to demons.
[174:58.89]Look at how much I'm melting this guy.
[175:03.21]Did you see that?
[175:05.37]I have 100% more damage to demons and undead.
[175:09.63]I may as well be unkillable.
[175:12.97]I may as well have put it on players 50.
[175:15.11]Because there's no way I'm going to lose ever again.
[175:20.48]I mean, like, jeez.
[175:21.46]This is not fair.
[175:22.36]I just uninstalled the game.
[175:34.14]Alright, looking for another, uh, prison.
[175:37.94]Looking for another prison.
[175:40.68]Yell if you see one.
[175:43.16]No... I don't think it would be that much further down than this.
[176:02.38]Although it could be.
[176:11.99]How am I this powerful?
[176:18.41]You struggle with a Necro on normal?
[176:25.56]I'm not sure I am.
[176:32.83]I mean, I'm pretty weak, to be honest.
[176:35.85]Abaddon!
[176:36.55]Just a random dungeon.
[176:41.59]Not looking for Abaddon, though.
[176:42.69]We're looking for another... We're looking for another Barbarian Camp, which for some reason we can't find.
[176:59.74]I'm so fast.
[177:02.58]I can just ski around at 75% extra speed.
[177:07.96]No, it's definitely down.
[177:11.87]It's definitely not this far up.
[177:14.77]What's my favorite PS2 game?
[177:28.80]Uh... I don't know.
[177:35.83]that's a pretty good question I have no idea I don't have any idea Tony Hawk's Underground no no I don't know that's what you get in like an hour give me a little bit of office over there
[178:09.24]Alright, barbarian camp.
[178:12.94]Barbarian camp.
[178:20.21]I thought I would've bet all my chips that it was right there.
[178:25.87]And I would've lost all my chips.
[178:28.79]And then I would've fucking slowly been like, okay, cool.
[178:32.87]Thanks for the game.
[178:33.63]Thanks for the game, guys.
[178:35.49]And I'd just slowly get up from the chair and go to my car.
[178:40.52]Yep, buh-bye!
[178:41.40]See you later!
[178:41.82]Fun night!
[178:44.70]Is that the door would close in the car?
[178:47.63]And I'd be like, haha, let's go home.
[178:53.05]Just fucking, just, just scream.
[179:07.69]What's my favorite chip?
[179:08.77]Fake blades.
[179:14.81]You're doing the YouTuber voice at the poker table.
[179:17.01]You deserve to lose your chips.
[179:21.10]Imagine going to the poker table or like the blackjack table and being like, okay, sounds good.
[179:29.96]So what's that, 11?
[179:31.90]I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to double down on that one.
[179:35.41]It would be like, shut the fuck up.
[179:38.69]I'm sorry?
[179:41.03]Oh, I can't hear you.
[179:52.05]The YouTuber voice.
[179:53.87]Where is this other barbarian camp?
[179:56.43]Or should I say, where is this other barbarian camp?
[180:01.45]I'll translate it.
[180:02.29]I'll translate everything into YouTube for you guys.
[180:06.69]Just in case anyone didn't know.
[180:14.57]Where is anybody?
[180:45.49]Bring back the voice actor frog?
[180:48.53]Um... I don't think I could do that.
[180:56.80]I'm not sure we'll see him again.
[181:02.02]He did not like... He was not happy on that stream.
[181:05.24]He was very angry with me.
[181:10.66]I apparently... I quote, put him on the spot.
[181:27.21]he said it would be as if I called you to come over my house to stream from my house on my channel as you and I laughed in his face I don't know he didn't call me ever again
[182:02.46]I'm going to retell the joke.
[182:03.38]I missed it.
[182:04.16]Yeah.
[182:05.38]But that frog actor is not going to come back.
[182:10.34]Weirdly enough.
[182:17.80]When's Beautyberry coming back?
[182:23.99]When he makes his album.
[182:26.97]I'll scare him through the 70s.
[182:34.37]It's ten hits sung by Bugleberry himself, of his own writing, based on original characters he wrote and drew.
[182:45.98]Too far.
[182:47.14]Gotta go up.
[182:53.88]No.
[182:54.06]He drew these characters on a piece of paper, like artists draw and drew them.
[183:04.32]Alright, I need to find these barbarians before I lose my mind.
[183:09.74]No, I want this guy.
[183:15.91]I don't want you.
[183:18.19]Come on.
[183:19.65]Barbarians.
[183:20.53]Barbarians.
[183:21.01]I need one more.
[183:22.47]Where are they?
[183:39.31]Bugleberry Bugleberry Maybe this way?
[183:50.99]Bugleberry sucks No, he doesn't.
[183:57.32]I can't believe you guys didn't like him.
[183:59.56]He was so sad
[184:06.87]Hey, hey, hey.
[184:08.20]He made his $40.
[184:08.90]Okay.
[184:26.36]And when I handed him the money, I gave him two 20s.
[184:30.40]He was like, two 20s!
[184:34.46]He was like really fucking VIP, excited about it.
[184:37.22]It was like he'd never seen that much money before in his life.
[184:40.18]It was really weird.
[184:41.06]I mean, I can't do the impression well, but you know.
[184:54.19]And he called me from his car.
[184:57.25]And he asked me if I still had one of the 20s.
[185:01.51]And I said, no.
[185:03.09]He said, I'll do my best here.
[185:05.75]Well, I only have one.
[185:06.77]Are you sure?
[185:09.41]Somewhere along the way, he lost one of the 20s.
[185:11.39]I don't know how.
[185:12.79]He put them both in the same pocket.
[185:13.89]I don't understand.
[185:19.32]It was within five minutes of me handing it to him.
[185:21.28]And I'm like, dude, I paid you.
[185:23.34]Like, I can't... I'm not going to give you another 20.
[185:25.48]Like, you...
[185:38.90]And then he called again that night, and he asked me... He just real quick wanted to ask me what kind of dog I had.
[185:44.56]What was the breed?
[185:45.72]I don't think he was under the assumption that he was gonna buy a dog with $40.
[185:49.73]Or $20.
[185:54.37]He's a weird guy.
[185:55.13]Alright, got them all.
[186:04.71]That's good.
[186:10.64]There is a matter which hello Afternoon He just wanted a puppy we've been hating on him
[186:45.02]You're so mean, Bugleberry's a good person.
[186:50.57]I cannot speak to Bugleberry's character.
[186:52.97]The guy carries around urns of demons and shit.
[186:57.39]You know how long it took after the Halloween stream to get that fucking thing back inside of its dwelling?
[187:22.63]An hour?
[187:24.97]No.
[187:30.31]Try three weeks.
[187:31.15]This motherfucker put on like costumes and was running around.
[187:37.60]Was going to the bank and shit.
[187:41.48]We had to tail him in his... Bugleberry's fucking shitty old car.
[187:47.14]There he is.
[187:48.00]He's at the bank.
[187:49.66]I'll take... I'll get him.
[187:50.25]I'll get him.
[187:50.51]You have to distract him.
[187:52.85]So fucking stupid.
[188:20.24]Maybe you should check in with him sometimes.
[188:24.04]Oh, don't worry.
[188:24.52]He checks in with me.
[188:28.06]All the time, actually.
[188:38.01]And I answer the phone every time and we talk because we're fucking old friends.
[188:43.31]I love Beaverberry.
[188:44.05]He's the best.
[189:05.91]You know, I've got this great, great plan for Jiggleberry.
[189:11.82]I can't wait.
[189:13.44]It's gonna be awesome.
[189:14.88]I cannot wait.
[189:21.50]If only I could tell you.
[189:31.02]If only I could tell you what the plan is for people to build.
[189:37.90]A lot of you would actually probably be really happy.
[189:39.70]Because I am.
[190:03.51]We lack critical information.
[190:06.29]I have big bits?
[190:14.46]Hold on, what?
[190:21.50]Oh, freak out.
[190:23.34]Freak... How many times did you do this?
[190:27.50]One, two, three, four... Did you just give two, what, a hundred dollars?
[190:38.70]Alright, Freakout just gave a hundred dollars worth of bits.
[190:43.64]There's a lot of information here.
[190:51.60]Hold on.
[190:52.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[190:52.88]This is... This is confusing me.
[191:02.88]First of all, thanks for the hundred dollars.
[191:07.88]Jeremy, I've been watching you for a few years.
[191:09.62]Have you ever seen a professional RC car race?
[191:12.69]I have not.
[191:15.31]Here you go.
[191:16.51]Speaking of cars, when was the last time you worked on your car?
[191:18.93]I don't.
[191:20.43]I know it might seem like a steep hill to climb, but I've been working for Honda as a technician for a few months now.
[191:24.97]Why do I feel like this is not real?
[191:29.61]I don't think this is real.
[191:30.75]I think this is made up.
[191:38.37]I can guide you along the way.
[191:39.43]The following is a list of things anybody can check without having to buy any expensive tools.
[191:44.31]Wiper blades, washer fluid, engine filter and cabin AC filter, battery terminals, drive belt, front rear brake pads, tire tread, transmission fluid.
[191:54.21]I'm not going to do any of this.
[191:58.74]No, I just drop it off and I say, please fix my car, sir.
[192:01.72]And then they charge me $1,500.
[192:02.58]For like, that's what I do.
[192:11.75]Uh, anti-freeze power steering fluid.
[192:15.27]Tire pressure.
[192:16.51]If you find any of these are in need of any attention or replacement, you should bring it to a local dealership or certified mechanic.
[192:22.69]Or if you want, you can try to replace it yourself.
[192:24.21]Hey, that would be a great idea for a stream.
[192:26.36]Or if you do decide to do it yourself, you should take any and all precautions, even after working on cars for almost a year.
[192:32.10]The smell of these fluids would make me gag.
[192:33.86]You motherfucker.
[192:51.76]You motherfucker.
[193:00.68]I don't think I'm gonna be, I don't think I'm gonna be, uh, reading any more, uh, messages from Mr. Freakout.
[193:07.38]I think, uh, I think we've, I think we've hit the wall here.
[193:20.84]Talking about the codes, I'm not going to give any more codes.
[193:27.02]This is the porn guy, by the way, for those of you that are curious.
[193:31.64]This is the porn guy.
[193:42.79]I will answer this one question, though.
[193:45.43]I will give this to you.
[193:48.06]They wanted to ask how many towels I use on a weekly basis.
[193:51.77]One.
[193:53.75]Showering.
[193:54.37]I mean, that's a weird question, but I mean, one.
[194:02.71]I think, uh... God damn it, man.
[194:08.58]Go out the fly and fuck.
[194:12.30]Who uses one towel?
[194:13.54]One for every... No, one for, like, showering.
[194:15.38]I don't know.
[194:16.54]What does that mean?
[194:18.41]How many towels do you use on a weekly basis?
[194:20.51]Like, what, if I go to a pool, I'll use an extra towel?
[194:23.45]If I, like, I don't know, I use one towel a week?
[194:29.26]Every, like, three or four days, replace a towel?
[194:31.92]That's normal.
[194:40.67]You use a towel to wash your dishes and to shower.
[194:44.25]No, we're not, we have not, you're playing semantics now.
[194:47.83]Like, I'm thinking of how many towels I use in the bath, like, tub.
[194:53.83]I use one towel to, like, shower, get out, dry off.
[194:58.53]Three, four days will go by, use another one.
[195:01.89]You gotta conserve water, are you gonna wash a towel every day?
[195:05.02]You made the second part up.
[195:10.56]What do you mean, what?
[195:12.78]That's two.
[195:13.98]He doesn't wash dishes.
[195:15.80]No, you use a different towel.
[195:18.50]Okay.
[195:19.86]There's a dish towel.
[195:21.16]There's a bath towel.
[195:23.06]These are two separate entities that they use for different things.
[195:25.98]Okay, I use a dish towel.
[195:29.00]One.
[195:29.12]Why are we even talking about this?
[195:37.68]Thank you, Freakout, for the $500 in porn messages.
[195:42.23]And the tips on cars.
[195:44.91]But I'm sad to say I'm not... I will not be reading one of your messages again.
[195:52.87]That's... You popped out to the picture on this last message.
[195:57.61]You popped out to the picture and he caught it.
[196:07.73]You swung it right in the air and it was caught.
[196:11.13]You're out.
[196:12.81]You're out.
[196:13.59]That's it.
[196:14.93]I really appreciate it though, but you're out.
[196:46.46]No.
[196:46.58]Alright.
[196:47.14]You... You... You can... You link a bunch of porn codes twice.
[196:52.95]Two different times.
[196:54.41]And the third time, you reference explicitly the porn codes.
[196:59.45]Let's strike three, man.
[197:02.33]At some point, you gotta strike out.
[197:19.32]That's why he's naked.
[197:21.36]Um... Oh, yeah?
[197:22.72]This is on hardcore.
[197:28.33]I can't do that.
[197:32.05]Okay.
[197:50.42]What kind of weirdo would wear a backpack and a t-shirt?
[198:01.63]Some of you new viewers don't get it!
[198:05.39]No!
[198:05.91]Alright, I have to stand up.
[198:09.15]Guys, I'm wearing a boomer brace.
[198:18.63]See?
[198:22.13]I'm wearing a backpack and a fanny cap.
[198:24.11]A fanny pack.
[198:24.94]Strike three.
[198:35.11]Strike three.
[198:38.07]And you know it.
[198:38.71]You know it.
[198:39.29]Strike three.
[199:13.92]the bionic boomer another one?
[199:17.19]really?
[199:20.33]that was just like a bug I can't even do it yeah I've done it okay I've winked too many times I can't I don't know if I can do it anymore
[199:32.30]These are scam winks.
[199:33.62]Whatever.
[199:34.02]What do I want to do?
[199:52.91]I want to turn this in.
[199:57.12]I think the wink experiment has been a failure.
[200:02.17]Has it?
[200:03.27]Oh, I got a ring.
[200:06.79]Oh no, he gave me Ral Ort Tal.
[200:10.03]Ral Ort Tal.
[200:12.37]If only I had a socketed shield.
[200:14.14]That's what he says.
[200:17.94]Look for Anya under the crystalline passage by the frozen river.
[200:21.00]Anya is one of the townspeople here.
[200:22.66]She's trapped in ice.
[200:25.10]100,000 points to show Otto.
[200:26.39]No, I'm not going to drag my dog in here.
[200:30.61]I'm not going to, like, channel point my dog into the room.
[200:35.05]And, like, pick him up.
[200:36.18]No, that's, like, not... I don't want to do that to him.
[200:38.24]That's not nice.
[200:40.58]Hey, Otto, somebody gave 100,000 points.
[200:42.94]Come here, you.
[200:45.04]Look in the camera.
[200:47.30]You know, he's not a toy.
[200:48.86]I don't want to do that to him.
[201:00.48]Can I help you?
[201:05.76]Alright.
[201:06.16]Where's my... I'm good.
[201:07.38]I'm good.
[201:07.68]I'm good.
[201:07.96]I'm good.
[201:08.42]I'm good.
[201:10.67]He's a dog.
[201:11.19]He's not going to get mad if you pick him up.
[201:12.85]Alright.
[201:15.49]You see how many winks happen a stream?
[201:17.53]It's at least like six or seven.
[201:20.29]I don't want to pick him up and put him down, pick him up, put him down, pick him up.
[201:24.31]Plus, I got... Guys, I have a back brace on now.
[201:26.94]I can't do that anymore.
[201:27.96]I can't even move.
[201:44.25]Stuck in the chair forever.
[201:49.97]Forever.
[201:55.15]How about a nose cam?
[201:56.09]Alright, we need to go to the crystalline passage by the frozen river.
[202:02.41]It's, uh, I believe it's just a few going up.
[202:04.89]Oh, it's up to the right.
[202:06.11]Once, once you start to see frozen stuff.
[202:09.37]How do you know we're there?
[202:29.84]Somebody just asked, does Otto know any tricks?
[202:31.28]Yeah.
[202:32.94]He knows sit.
[202:33.94]He knows lie down.
[202:35.06]He knows roll over.
[202:35.86]He can do a lot of stuff.
[202:39.15]Kim actually taught Otto a lot of stuff.
[202:40.95]I think it's up here.
[202:50.87]He's very smart.
[202:52.73]Well, he's very motivated, to put it that way.
[202:56.81]If you have a little treat in your hand, he will do whatever you want.
[203:00.49]He'll be like, let's go.
[203:01.59]I know every trick now.
[203:11.80]Without a treat, he's just like, nah.
[203:14.92]You're like, hey, Otto, roll over.
[203:16.68]He's like, no, why?
[203:20.20]Roll over, Otto.
[203:20.92]No.
[203:21.20]No.
[203:23.32]I don't have anything I want.
[203:24.62]Why would I?
[203:26.03]He's smart.
[203:27.51]He's like, I only do that with shit that I want.
[203:31.87]It's like his streamer dad.
[204:02.60]Quest reward.
[204:07.73]What's Otto's alignment?
[204:08.95]Um, dog.
[204:09.97]I think dog is its own alignment, don't you think?
[204:26.86]I need more.
[204:28.62]I feel like I have people, but not a lot of people.
[204:31.24]How?
[204:31.88]I'm being overwhelmed.
[204:40.43]Karma's only funny when you give him money.
[204:46.57]That's not true.
[204:56.96]Let's keep moving.
[204:57.70]Almost level 30.
[204:58.48]What?
[204:58.88]32?
[204:58.90]Cool.
[205:01.24]Alright.
[205:02.84]Crystaline Passage.
[205:05.52]We need to go in.
[205:06.30]It's not this way.
[205:06.89]A little bit further up, I think.
[205:09.57]Pit of Archeron.
[205:10.85]Nope.
[205:14.87]There it is.
[205:16.21]Streamer, be mad for me.
[205:19.77]I can do that, yeah.
[205:22.43]Just open up twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[205:25.13]Go to the videos tab.
[205:29.85]Click.
[205:31.05]Oh, yeah.
[205:33.35]Click on the Tony Hawk Underground stream.
[205:37.67]And fast forward to about nine hours into the stream.
[205:42.88]And then let go and watch.
[205:54.31]This thing sucks.
[205:54.93]I guess the poison's alright, but... Just go watch the Jump King stream.
[206:09.03]I'm glad I caught that live.
[206:11.38]I'm glad he caught it live, too.
[206:15.06]I thought it was fun.
[206:15.80]I did.
[206:16.12]Alright, here we go.
[206:17.06]Crystalline Passage.
[206:20.44]Now we're fucking... This is no longer a joke now.
[206:25.49]Once we get through here, this is where we're gonna see if I have what it takes to win.
[206:43.12]It's only muted for like 20 minutes.
[206:45.96]That's really good, actually.
[206:50.17]It's only muted for 20 minutes out of 10 and a half hours.
[206:55.13]What songs got grabbed?
[206:56.32]What did anybody know?
[206:58.36]What got scooped up?
[207:05.20]They killed all the skeletons.
[207:08.57]Level up!
[207:22.09]Can't revive champions, unfortunately.
[207:23.79]That'd be nice.
[207:36.31]Oh shit!
[207:36.81]I forgot that spawns a champion.
[207:47.12]Okay.
[207:54.21]Alright, let's do the skill point.
[207:56.85]Take a look.
[207:58.86]This is what we have so far.
[208:03.14]We're at the bottom here.
[208:03.96]I'll give you a better picture here in a second.
[208:09.16]Here we go.
[208:16.21]Take us somewhere.
[208:17.81]Take us somewhere.
[208:18.51]I'm going to sneeze.
[208:19.95]So if you hate sneezing, I would...
[208:23.76]I would just leave the stream open.
[208:27.86]Walk away from your computer.
[208:36.25]No, it's not gonna happen.
[208:38.71]Ah, the worst.
[208:44.23]Darn.
[208:45.43]This might be a zoom-in.
[208:49.30]I think this is a zoom-in.
[208:54.58]What does more revive do?
[208:55.86]More revives.
[208:58.96]So you can have two, three, four, five, six.
[209:05.59]I think we have to zoom in.
[209:06.97]Sorry, teeth.
[209:08.27]That's never going to happen.
[209:18.83]Sorry, teeth.
[209:24.08]Try again.
[209:45.01]Okay.
[209:49.57]Cancel crew.
[209:54.57]We're going to do a second point and revive.
[209:55.97]Thanks for voting.
[209:58.05]Don't go anywhere yet.
[209:58.79]Whoa.
[210:16.59]He needs mana.
[210:18.15]He needs vitality.
[210:19.03]He needs more strength.
[210:28.36]Imagine helping the streamer.
[210:29.77]It's up to you.
[210:36.20]Vitality it is.
[210:40.63]Back to it.
[210:48.61]This will get us a second revive.
[210:52.13]By the way, in case anyone is curious, revive, it just, every point you put in just lets me have more revives.
[211:01.64]That life and damage only comes from Skeleton Mastery and Summon Resist.
[211:09.25]So, it pulls from Skeleton Mastery.
[211:14.07]This does not do anything else but give me more revives.
[211:19.29]I want to make sure that's clear.
[211:21.95]And whatever is, yes, whatever is summoned.
[211:25.60]Let's get a... Do we have a harpy?
[211:28.00]Here we go.
[211:40.37]I'll take both these guys.
[211:41.41]They don't explode.
[211:44.71]He did.
[211:45.21]Okay.
[211:52.50]They both exploded.
[211:55.17]Great.
[211:58.83]These Moon Lords are really powerful.
[212:00.01]I'll take both of them.
[212:05.13]They can't explode, though.
[212:06.33]Come on, I need another revive.
[212:21.62]Hey, buddy.
[212:25.06]Alright, the skeleton mages that are freezing people.
[212:27.93]Could you hold off on doing that?
[212:29.39]Here we go.
[212:35.63]My mana is such shit.
[212:37.81]If I revive one person, that's it.
[212:41.75]Drink a potion after doing one spell.
[212:43.49]Where you going Moon Lord?
[212:51.41]Get over here.
[213:00.11]We're starting to get a very large amount of people.
[213:02.80]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[213:04.30]There are 12 summons.
[213:08.28]Taking up lots of space.
[213:18.16]You have a whole community.
[213:19.28]It's just gonna get bigger.
[213:25.41]Especially with the revives.
[213:27.25]You can have, like, 20 revives, 12 skeletons, like, 8 skeletal mages.
[213:32.14]You can have a stupid amount of people.
[213:42.80]These people have their own Discord.
[213:52.47]Whoop.
[213:57.08]Can I just say, to all watching right now, I didn't think that I was going to be playing Diablo II into Act 5.
[214:05.02]I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this.
[214:11.39]I think this is really cool.
[214:14.29]I thought I was going to make it to Act 1.
[214:18.37]Didn't think I was going to go much further than that.
[214:21.69]But here we are.
[214:31.79]Oh, I left a decent resist charm on the ground.
[214:34.35]It was like five resist.
[214:35.87]I apologize.
[214:38.81]I forgot it.
[214:45.54]Will I be able to enjoy Diablo non-hardcore after this?
[214:48.18]Yeah.
[214:48.52]Because as interesting as this is to do... I just like kind of running around and dying doesn't matter and...
[215:01.25]I'm looking for a character for sure.
[215:03.85]Alright, we need the Crystalline Plants from the Frozen River.
[215:15.10]I'm looking for the Frozen River.
[215:21.52]It's one of these places here.
[215:22.94]We're going pretty smooth though.
[215:39.53]How did the Moon Lord die already?
[215:44.59]Is that even possible?
[215:52.49]The river is frozen because it's still a river.
[215:54.25]I don't know.
[216:02.67]Yeah?
[216:05.37]it is the waypoint yeah it is because it's just it's a river river alright let's find this passage down here it really can only be this way so it has to be over here watch out for the champions
[216:43.40]I wish I could revive these guys.
[216:48.59]Come on.
[216:51.49]Surprise me with a Unique.
[216:54.59]Unique.
[216:55.45]Nope.
[217:02.31]Frozen River.
[217:09.76]Anya is out here somewhere.
[217:10.72]There's also... I remember there's a champion here that can be a pain in the ass.
[217:14.70]Oh, I'm gonna be careful.
[217:17.59]These bombables are... oh boy.
[217:20.53]I'm gonna stay back here, I'm not going over there.
[217:23.79]Who revived?
[217:32.92]See that ship?
[217:35.04]My mana is so bad.
[217:40.97]It's just a brawl and I don't even know who's winning.
[217:43.54]I hope it's us.
[218:00.69]Burrito turns into pure carbons.
[218:05.85]It's still a burrito.
[218:16.40]No.
[218:17.38]I don't think so.
[218:24.80]No, it's carbon.
[218:27.58]Yeah, because if a river freezes, it's still water.
[218:34.03]Burrito turns into carbon, then it's carbon.
[218:35.71]It's not still burrito.
[218:50.49]Oh, by the way, I know the story now.
[218:54.31]I knew it already, but I know the whole story.
[219:01.76]I was kind of on the right track.
[219:02.98]The shit I was saying to you guys was a joke.
[219:04.60]I didn't really believe that.
[219:13.41]But yeah, that's pretty cool.
[219:15.03]That's a pretty cool story.
[219:16.88]That's a pretty cool story.
[219:19.56]Story of the Quantum Burrito?
[219:20.98]No, the story of... The story of Outer Wilds.
[219:39.34]Playing like I'm 5, Outer Wilds.
[219:42.87]No, I've read a couple of timelines.
[219:45.18]There were some good timelines to really piece the whole thing together.
[219:50.44]Like a whole chronological hit, like events.
[219:53.83]Easier to see that way.
[219:56.09]And I don't want to talk about anything about it because people probably hear that might not have played it, but it's pretty good.
[220:01.51]It's pretty good.
[220:19.26]Read a synopsis?
[220:20.24]Yeah, kind of.
[220:21.04]Isn't that what you do?
[220:23.06]Alright, Anya, where are you?
[220:26.80]Usually right in the middle, right?
[220:27.82]Uh-oh.
[220:37.33]That wasn't smart.
[220:40.13]No one's still alive.
[220:46.88]I have way too many healing potions.
[220:48.86]Just throw them away.
[221:03.05]I love that sound.
[221:06.15]That paladin charge sound.
[221:09.84]It's got a good ring to it.
[221:25.23]Alright, Anya, come on.
[221:26.27]What the hell?
[221:28.71]Not down here, huh?
[221:30.99]Pain in the ass.
[221:32.15]Fine.
[221:32.86]How in the world is this supposed to come to Steam this year?
[221:48.34]Well, the sooner the better.
[221:58.56]Don't get overwhelmed.
[221:59.26]A little too late.
[222:05.97]Yeah, they did kind of release that game on Epic Games Store right when Epic Games Store was kind of becoming that exclusivity thing, right?
[222:14.45]How long?
[222:14.73]When did it come out?
[222:15.25]Like six months ago?
[222:16.43]Seven months ago?
[222:25.97]Is it on the Windows Store?
[222:27.45]I don't know, but I don't know very many people that use the Windows Store.
[222:31.71]Was it early last year?
[222:32.87]Yeah.
[222:43.32]Games for Windows.
[222:44.35]Hog.
[222:47.35]Or what?
[222:47.73]Alright, hey.
[222:49.84]What's the anti-pog?
[222:51.76]What is anti-pog?
[222:53.62]Is there one?
[222:54.08]I feel like the market is... Could be super... What's anti-pog?
[223:03.03]Resident... No, I don't know.
[223:04.41]ResidentSleeper is like... I'm... Like, this is boring.
[223:06.97]I'm falling asleep.
[223:09.63]Anti-pog would be... Like, what you did was not as cool as you thought it was.
[223:20.05]Like, you did something that was supposed to be exciting, but it wasn't.
[223:35.08]Haha.
[223:36.84]Eh.
[223:39.82]Eh, but... I guess.
[223:42.18]Eh.
[223:47.48]Okay.
[223:51.14]Failfish?
[223:55.45]Yeah, never mind.
[223:56.39]Failfish fills that completely.
[224:02.19]Not like this.
[224:02.77]Yeah.
[224:05.01]Yeah, they're there.
[224:11.94]They're there.
[224:12.50]Have I played Temtem?
[224:21.62]No.
[224:23.04]I have not played Temtem.
[224:26.84]I probably will not play Temtem.
[224:28.18]I probably will avoid Temtem.
[224:30.18]I don't have a plan to play it.
[224:33.14]Well, avoid was probably the wrong word to use.
[224:36.76]I'm going to use a better one.
[224:40.50]I'm not into collecting and fighting monsters unless they come from a seedy stone.
[224:50.43]I think we're close.
[225:11.85]Can we get a price check on ChibiRobo, please?
[225:25.88]200?
[225:25.90]It's 200?
[225:26.06]Still, it's 200?
[225:26.38]Wait, you can buy it on the GameStop website?
[226:01.09]Remember when Jeremy used to play TF2?
[226:02.85]Pepe hands.
[226:03.43]Come on, dude.
[226:09.33]I... I played... I played every single day.
[226:13.60]What are you talking about?
[226:33.31]Give to waiting room.
[226:35.82]Well, you're appoint- you're gonna be waiting- there they are.
[226:39.28]Your appointment's not for a very long- you'll be waiting a very long time.
[226:43.80]I think you should probably bring some snacks and maybe a few dinners to that waiting room.
[226:52.47]Not only dinners, mmm, like, rations.
[226:56.09]You know, when by waiting room, I hope you mean bunker.
[227:14.17]so many potions but no mana potions no I have no I have no plan to play it on stream or anything it's a great game one of the best
[227:51.39]Do I enjoy variety too much to play what play... I missed that message, but I think I forgot the gist of it.
[227:57.52]Do I like variety too much to stick with something?
[228:00.52]Pick something that I played or liked or stay with one game?
[228:05.02]I'm not even sure it's about variety as much as it's... I can't stay with the same thing.
[228:13.57]Like, just for example, I'm not playing Diablo II right now to, like, make sure my stream has variety.
[228:19.13]This is just what I want to do.
[228:24.67]Everything you see, I mean, sure, there's a lot of recommendations on the channel, and you do a lot of them, but... It's not, this is not like variety for the sake of me doing, oh, I'm going to do variety for the channel.
[228:37.32]My brain needs to be constantly stimulated.
[228:41.96]And I get bored really easily.
[228:47.10]So that's why it was a shock that I was able to really stay with TF2 for that long.
[228:53.47]That just speaks to how good that game actually is.
[229:00.01]Are we boring you?
[229:00.77]No, we're talking about video games, not like talking to people.
[229:08.79]We're getting kind of creamed here.
[229:21.74]Where you going?
[229:23.77]That guy just fucked off somewhere.
[229:25.21]Hey, get back here.
[229:26.03]You're supposed to be helping.
[229:30.79]This frozen Stein.
[229:37.13]This is gonna get bad.
[229:39.29]Kill frozen Stein first.
[229:51.60]this mission is really awesome you get a very very special you get a very special item for doing this and
[230:17.29]That son.
[230:21.07]That bastard.
[230:25.29]Do I ever get a desire to go back to TF2?
[230:31.52]Not in the way that you think.
[230:36.10]Not in the way that you think.
[230:41.90]I do miss Team Fortress 2 because a lot of people have tried to do this too, and I think have not done it as well or have failed trying.
[230:52.11]It's very specific.
[230:53.83]It's making your characters in your game, the character classes, the people that you play as, such interesting personality types and such truly engaging characters.
[231:12.17]That you want to play as them and you want to hear more of their stories.
[231:17.27]People have tried to do, like, remember those shorts?
[231:21.65]I remember when the only ones that were out were, there were three of them.
[231:26.17]And when Meet the Medic was in development for like four years.
[231:30.97]Meet the Medic was supposed to come out in like 2009 or something.
[231:36.68]It was a huge fucking deal when it came out.
[231:40.44]I think a lot of game companies have tried to do that.
[231:45.13]And it's just not as interesting.
[231:48.87]Like, the character, the Demoman character was fucking awesome.
[231:58.40]The spy was awesome.
[232:00.46]They all had these insanely different personalities.
[232:03.92]I mean, they're all crazy.
[232:06.11]But in different ways.
[232:08.86]I don't think there'll ever be another TF2 Demoman.
[232:14.34]I really don't.
[232:15.24]I don't think that people will try, but I don't know if it'll ever happen.
[232:21.48]The heavy weapons guy.
[232:23.00]Just think of that.
[232:24.38]Oh, by the way, big deal.
[232:25.92]Big deal.
[232:29.40]Oh, no, not yet.
[232:29.91]Spoilers.
[232:36.76]Heavy Weapons guys, characterization-wise, voice acting-wise, they all had these crazy personalities.
[232:45.42]We forgot about the princess.
[232:51.84]And the thing about the TF2 voices, guys, and the actors that play them, they're not big famous names in the industry.
[233:01.40]The guy that's the Demoman and the heavy weapons guy is not some heavyweight in the voice acting world.
[233:14.91]The medic is really the only one that has an actor that was, at the time, I mean still, Robin Atkins Downs, at the time, in like 2007, that was a long time ago.
[233:27.49]Nathan was streaming a little while ago.
[233:29.79]Yeah, he streams and he's around.
[233:49.55]The characterization that he gave to that scout, I mean, when you first played as the scout, it was just like, this guy, I love this.
[233:57.86]This is awesome.
[234:03.82]We've actually streamed together before.
[234:05.98]Some of you guys that might, the last couple years or the last year or two, you may not have watched the streams, but he's been on stream like three or four times.
[234:15.21]We played Dark Souls together one time.
[234:18.66]Yeah, we played Dark Souls 3.
[234:23.69]I get permanent resistance for taking this.
[234:26.03]Take a look.
[234:28.21]Pretty awesome.
[234:28.97]It's always there.
[234:30.19]Permanent.
[234:35.08]Let's talk to Anya.
[234:40.06]Remember when Jerma used to play Dark Souls?
[234:43.90]Well, remember the future where I play Elden Ring.
[234:55.71]and like collaboration streams you should collab you should collab yeah we've talked about collabs before we've talked about streaming with other streamers and stuff before it's I don't really do it very rarely is there a multiplayer stream here it's just kind of I just kind of do my own thing
[235:15.52]Organically something might come along where it's like yeah, that sounds like fun.
[235:18.40]Let's do that Bomb streams with Joel were great Yeah, they were a lot of fun Nilafak has escaped to his temple where he's being a real piece of shit
[235:47.87]I mean, I talk to a lot of people and stuff, but I have that sort of philosophy of... Hold on, this is actually kind of good.
[236:02.04]Ray Skeletal Mage.
[236:05.02]Can I finally just get rid of this fucking thing?
[236:08.04]This thing is bad.
[236:08.98]2 to Ray Skeleton.
[236:13.48]38, 20.
[236:14.30]Look at how bad this is.
[236:15.34]It's just because it has the 2 in Ray Skeleton.
[236:25.17]a part of the reasons why I do a lot mostly solo stuff is because I I talk a lot I'm like oh it's like oh look at me I gotta say this and I gotta say this and I gotta say and I I anytime there's like more than two three four people
[236:42.33]in a stream call or something, it's always like, especially when you get to be about three, four plus kind of people, it's almost like you take turns talking.
[236:53.82]And you don't want to talk over somebody, and somebody has something to say, but then you have something to say, but you don't want to talk over them, and it almost becomes like, and especially if everybody's streaming at the same time.
[237:02.71]If you have like three streamers who are all streaming at the same time, they all want to talk.
[237:07.23]They all want to talk to their audience and engage with people and talk and try to make it fun.
[237:11.09]And you almost become like, it's my turn to entertain my audience.
[237:16.08]No, now it's my turn to entertain my audience.
[237:17.76]Now it's my turn to entertain my audience.
[237:19.38]It's like, you go in a weird circle.
[237:28.92]and then when people start muting each other and muting themselves and somebody like is talking to their chat and then it's like hey you still here yep I'm here what yep and the sounds of other people talking let's say if let's say I mute if I mute the stream you know it it's just something I don't really like to do I love playing multiplayer when it works it works right
[237:58.93]And some people love doing content in groups.
[238:02.39]And it works very, very well for them.
[238:04.05]There are at least three or four streaming groups that stream together almost every time on this site.
[238:10.91]And they do a great fucking job and they really connect together and they work together perfectly.
[238:19.04]I kind of just like doing me.
[238:20.46]You know?
[238:26.32]I'm just me here.
[238:33.34]And that's not to say there's a right or wrong way to do that.
[238:36.32]But, you know, you do the things that you know that you'd like to do.
[238:42.49]That's pretty much it.
[238:43.07]I can't remove this because it has two array skeleton in it.
[239:01.81]I can't let this be... I can't hold this over my own head.
[239:04.43]It's only one point.
[239:06.15]If we're losing... How many points... What would we lose?
[239:07.85]One skeleton?
[239:09.65]Alright, the skeletons just suck anyways.
[239:11.40]They're dying.
[239:17.88]One to confuse, one to... We lose one point.
[239:20.86]What's going on?
[239:22.66]Look at how much other stuff we get.
[239:23.68]Fire block.
[239:29.36]Mana, Lightning Resist.
[239:31.48]And I actually get to have Poison Dagger.
[239:35.70]Hey, Gemma, this is Diablo.
[239:36.72]Please stop cheating at my game.
[239:38.29]You think the tricks or glitches are so cool, but you're going to ruin the immersion game that I make for you.
[239:45.11]You think duping is cool.
[239:46.27]You think cheating is cool.
[239:47.79]If not, please stop.
[239:49.53]I'm crying.
[239:50.04]Did that comet just get removed?
[239:55.20]I think it just got purged.
[240:03.25]I gotta get rid of some of this stuff.
[240:05.73]What time is it?
[240:06.19]I gotta check the time.
[240:06.95]Okay, I still got a little bit.
[240:10.45]Still got a little bit of time.
[240:13.86]Rip that dev.
[240:14.76]Okay, ort.
[240:24.48]There's tal.
[240:26.50]How many thals do I have?
[240:33.48]Can I make anything?
[240:36.34]Yes, I can.
[240:39.18]I can make this.
[240:43.46]Diamonds are... not very good.
[240:46.27]I never was a fan of the diamonds in this game.
[241:01.69]All resist, no, all resist aid is better.
[241:03.40]I can sell the rest of this shit.
[241:07.90]Okay.
[241:23.71]Still this lightning resist jewel.
[241:25.72]I have nowhere to put it.
[241:29.61]Oh, what's my favorite PS2 game?
[241:32.01]Sure thing.
[241:33.75]Uh, The Bouncer.
[241:34.63]That looks clean.
[241:51.02]You're good to go now.
[241:52.58]Okay, no, no, no.
[241:53.04]I gotta go back and I gotta go to, uh, the palace.
[242:04.69]You are about to see the thing that Blizzard had to patch because it was so easy to farm.
[242:12.05]Did you see where I just went in, right?
[242:14.89]See this guy right here?
[242:16.96]Kindle skin.
[242:18.90]You could just pour it in here.
[242:22.84]And... Okay, there's like a thousand people.
[242:25.54]Hold on.
[242:37.61]They, uh, nerfed his loot table.
[242:41.33]Because it was too easy just to come in here and just kill him instantly and leave.
[242:45.33]And he dropped really, really good shit.
[242:50.27]Alright, stop hitting me.
[242:53.50]Goddamn.
[243:07.20]Killed him.
[243:09.20]I would laugh my ass off if he dropped like a Zod rune right now.
[243:26.86]I would.
[243:27.18]I would laugh my ass off.
[243:35.36]Where is he?
[243:35.82]Kindle skin.
[243:38.54]Is he already dead?
[243:39.20]I think he's already dead.
[243:42.10]These guys come back to life.
[243:45.70]Wait, did he come out?
[243:46.36]Yeah, he's dead.
[243:53.28]We're going to level up though.
[243:54.64]Take a look.
[244:08.62]At this point, do I even give you guys choice?
[244:11.06]Alright, make sure when you click... Yes, yes, yes.
[244:22.85]Uh-huh, I will.
[244:24.47]Alright, make sure when you click, if you're clicking down here, if you want Fire Golem, make sure you click, like, over here.
[244:35.50]If you want revive, make sure you're clicking, like, here.
[244:37.94]So the bubbles can spread out.
[244:40.72]So we don't have to zoom in.
[244:42.10]If you want teeth, well, then you're just out of your mind.
[244:45.38]And you're deliberately trying to ruin my video game playthrough.
[244:49.26]And I don't appreciate it.
[244:50.10]What do you want?
[245:05.82]Come on.
[245:06.02]Okay.
[245:30.54]I'm going to let this play out for a little bit because it's okay.
[245:33.42]So I have to ask for help here.
[245:37.91]There are 4,500 people watching right now and there are 560 votes.
[245:43.58]For the love of God, please, some of you, fix this.
[245:59.69]Third point is just throwing it in the trash.
[246:09.85]He's influencing.
[246:11.31]Well, I directly asked.
[246:18.16]I don't know where the bubbles are going to separate here.
[246:25.68]But it looks like a majority want to go down there.
[246:42.13]55, 55, that's... 20... 20, so... Zoom in?
[246:54.96]I have to zoom in.
[246:55.78]I'll do it again.
[247:08.85]I'm gonna squish it.
[247:19.69]I have to like really squish this.
[247:21.35]Get it so you can see both.
[247:44.11]Okay.
[247:49.18]Again.
[248:08.27]Jermamandering?
[248:13.70]Nobody clicked on the curse menu.
[248:20.78]If even one person had clicked on Amplify Damage, nobody clicked over there.
[248:28.73]I did.
[248:32.69]Looks like we're doing another point into Fire Golem.
[248:40.80]Bob, this game is so lame.
[248:42.50]Can't we have some fun?
[248:43.98]Whoa!
[248:46.86]Calling Diablo II lame.
[248:50.42]What the heck?
[248:52.26]What the fuck?
[248:56.43]I'm upset about that comment.
[248:58.11]Alright, let's go.
[249:00.73]Fire Golem.
[249:01.85]Another point.
[249:04.81]And pick these two.
[249:08.51]Dude, the Dreamcast sucks laughing my ass off.
[249:15.34]The Dreamcast fucking sucks laughing my ass off.
[249:20.46]That's one of my favorite moments ever on stream.
[249:23.73]Hey guys, I'm showing you this cool Dreamcast.
[249:25.87]Look at all these games.
[249:27.01]This one sucks.
[249:28.41]This one's not very good.
[249:30.09]This one's really, really crusty and really not a very, like, kind of bad game.
[249:35.27]Somebody just random dude in chat.
[249:37.93]The Dreamcast fucking sucks.
[249:39.93]LMAO.
[249:41.43]In the middle of like one of those kind of bad games that I was trying to show.
[249:50.82]Like that person may have never even seen the Dreamcast before.
[249:53.60]It's just like, dude, this console sucks.
[249:57.48]Like, no, it doesn't.
[249:58.32]I promise.
[249:58.88]Alright, Vitality.
[250:05.20]What happened?
[250:09.82]Did I get like banned from single player?
[250:18.60]What the hell was that?
[250:19.28]Here's what's gonna happen Fire gone That's way more damage.
[250:31.23]That's a lot of damage
[250:38.38]Did I get timed out?
[250:39.66]You can't get timed out in single player.
[250:42.26]You know what probably happened?
[250:43.14]I had the game paused.
[250:44.74]When I clicked back into the window, it probably clicked right here.
[250:48.66]And just... It's alright, I wasn't that far.
[250:51.71]Alright, we're gonna... Our guy is good.
[250:56.05]124 mana.
[250:56.39]What a joke.
[251:03.99]Speaking of which, I'm just gonna fill my sack with mana.
[251:09.22]Just to the brim.
[251:19.88]One spell requires a full potion, so that sucks.
[251:26.69]I need a better belt, too.
[251:27.95]Look at all this bad shit that I have on.
[251:32.88]Why is the cube in your inventory?
[251:34.54]Or extra space in my inventory?
[251:36.22]I usually put the cube here, but people were not happy about that.
[251:41.27]So I'm doing the thing that people were saying to try.
[251:48.23]Okay, let's go.
[251:50.13]Hey, we get to kill Pendleskin again.
[251:52.38]The familiar scent of death.
[252:02.59]How's the Fire Golem doing?
[252:03.52]Better than last time?
[252:04.18]It's got like an AoE effect.
[252:08.28]It's alright.
[252:14.95]Um, guys.
[252:15.89]We're getting closed in.
[252:29.96]Okay.
[252:30.98]I got some friends now.
[252:31.78]We're good.
[252:35.88]Oh, I heard the ding and I was like, no way.
[252:37.72]Oh, I only have four skeletons because I took off the... Oh, that's right.
[252:44.15]I'm sitting there going, why can't I get a fifth skeleton?
[252:47.63]I was thinking about getting a fireman tattoo.
[252:49.74]Shale!
[252:50.78]That's a pretty rare one.
[252:54.14]That's actually not... That's pretty good.
[252:56.16]This is rare.
[252:58.57]It's not super rare.
[252:59.45]It's like second or third tier.
[253:00.63]That's pretty good.
[253:07.93]That's like a tier two.
[253:11.35]That's pretty good.
[253:11.87]Nice.
[253:12.87]I'm happy about that.
[253:13.51]Alright, let's move.
[253:18.05]Nilafax Temple.
[253:27.96]How the fuck do I have this?
[253:28.64]Oh yeah, because I have a million potions.
[253:31.84]Let's store these.
[253:42.43]Junk.
[253:45.09]So we're trying to go down all the way to go fight Nilithac, the guy that imprisoned Anya in the ice.
[253:57.51]Get a bigger belt.
[253:58.75]Oh my god!
[253:59.95]I would, but... I mean, the cold resist and the defense is just... It's really good.
[254:18.54]It's really good.
[254:19.04]I just realized my title doesn't make any sense anymore.
[254:24.39]I thought I was gonna spend way longer on Diablo.
[254:27.70]I beat Diablo in like 45 minutes.
[254:30.22]I thought it was going to be the whole stream.
[254:31.82]Me trying desperately to get him to die.
[254:35.39]And like having him refill his health for like two hours.
[254:46.83]Well, it's still the name of the game.
[254:48.47]Yeah, that's true.
[254:50.16]It is the name of the game.
[254:50.94]You're right.
[254:54.20]Alright, don't go too far.
[255:05.49]Are these Nightlord's demons?
[255:09.43]I want both of them.
[255:13.62]It's not over here.
[255:14.38]Let's see if I can quickly find this.
[255:19.20]Then we have to go to Mount Ariat, and that's when the stream turns off.
[255:24.56]I don't think I'll be able to do it.
[255:25.84]But, hey, I will try.
[255:27.46]I'll give it a solid attempt.
[255:43.35]I'd say I'd be ready.
[255:46.99]Looking for the halls of want.
[255:55.86]Halls of not.
[255:57.00]Whatever it's called.
[255:57.72]What is it?
[255:58.34]What am I looking for?
[255:59.28]Halls of something.
[256:03.37]Alright guys, dead.
[256:09.22]Leveled up.
[256:09.54]Let's see.
[256:10.14]Level 33.
[256:12.10]Good.
[256:13.00]Nice.
[256:14.54]Good job.
[256:16.15]Alright.
[256:27.06]Let's get the skeleton brood back.
[256:28.58]Hi.
[256:39.84]Follow me.
[256:43.76]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[256:46.08]I forgot how big this place actually was.
[256:52.38]It's kind of huge.
[256:53.06]Any champions?
[256:54.64]No.
[256:56.38]Uh-oh.
[256:58.42]Am I getting cocky?
[257:00.07]Uh-oh.
[257:02.13]Uh-oh.
[257:02.69]I think I got cocky.
[257:12.53]I'm okay.
[257:15.57]Ooh, I'm alright.
[257:20.92]I just can run so fast, it's like almost a shame if I don't run.
[257:34.81]that champion alright pause here so we can rebuild the uh the team here okay let's keep going surprised I haven't found it
[258:12.17]I can just zoom around.
[258:13.15]I think it's up here.
[258:17.83]And what if I take a little... Okay, this is a stupid idea.
[258:23.89]Really bad idea.
[258:24.97]No, I have potions.
[258:26.53]Never mind.
[258:30.89]Pause it.
[258:31.37]Freeze it here.
[258:36.86]Well... We're in trouble.
[258:41.92]I may have flown too close to the sun here.
[258:45.20]It's possible.
[258:47.26]Oh, we're good.
[258:47.70]What am I talking about?
[258:48.78]Fine.
[258:49.10]Eh.
[258:49.16]Shit.
[258:50.20]I thought for sure it was going to be right here.
[259:22.88]Come on.
[259:24.86]Don't make me run all over the place.
[259:27.19]I just want to find the next level.
[259:29.07]Bottom right.
[259:38.51]Show auto.
[259:41.32]I can't show auto.
[259:42.16]He's not here.
[259:56.55]Flying around.
[259:59.53]Looking for the place to go down.
[260:02.38]I'm so glad I can run this fast.
[260:08.12]Um... Maybe I should rethink my strategy.
[260:11.56]Because that was pretty close.
[260:23.14]Damn.
[260:24.86]Alright, hold up here.
[260:31.27]I need some revives.
[260:35.68]Holy shit!
[260:40.88]Angelic Sickle.
[260:46.19]Three to eight.
[260:50.91]Oh, yiffy.
[261:04.08]I wonder if it... I think I have the angelic blood.
[261:10.24]Interrupt whatever your dog is doing and bring him here for our entertainment, Jeremy.
[261:16.72]I'm not gonna do that.
[261:24.54]Jesus.
[261:27.85]I can't... There it is.
[261:29.75]Alright.
[261:30.09]Halls of Pain.
[261:38.76]One more level.
[261:40.26]Hopefully I find it quick.
[261:41.92]Away from me!
[261:44.22]Alright, keep moving.
[262:14.05]Stop Lucky good.
[262:28.86]Finally.
[262:30.19]Took me long enough.
[262:32.35]Let's go kill Neelathak
[262:43.62]A lot of sapphire, that's pretty good.
[262:54.48]Is one of you going to die?
[263:00.23]Yes.
[263:01.95]Love it, love it, love it, is that true?
[263:04.89]Sure.
[263:08.97]Just for the fans.
[263:22.13]Oh, I forgot about this quest.
[263:23.53]For doing this, you get to name an item.
[263:26.49]You get to take any item that you own.
[263:28.27]Okay, here he is.
[263:32.17]Where is he?
[263:36.15]Is he right here somewhere?
[263:39.32]There he is.
[263:39.74]Okay.
[263:40.64]They're all his minions.
[263:41.66]It's Necromancer versus Necromancer.
[263:44.70]They're his summoned ogres.
[263:55.36]I'm just playing auto chess.
[263:56.74]Alright, get in.
[264:16.53]He has Corpse Explosion, though.
[264:18.57]That can kill me in probably one hit.
[264:20.25]I'm not going anywhere.
[264:30.06]I'm stepping over there.
[264:31.68]See?
[264:32.08]Holy fuck.
[264:34.56]He has a lot of corpses to work with.
[264:35.92]Alright, he's just a necromancer like me.
[264:40.95]Just go up there and punch him in the face.
[264:41.95]Alright, will you guys get out of here?
[264:44.15]Stop.
[264:44.45]Fight this thing.
[264:46.13]Oh!
[264:51.91]Kill him.
[264:55.85]Alright.
[264:57.19]Let's go.
[265:08.20]He teleports around.
[265:13.19]Alright, he ain't getting away now.
[265:18.51]We got this in the bag.
[265:24.40]Wait till something dies and then just bring it back to life.
[265:29.98]He's... Goddammit, man.
[265:34.42]Come on, Vik.
[265:35.70]I know you're capable.
[265:44.62]What's happening to the fireman?
[265:46.44]Like, get on him!
[265:50.64]Where'd he go?
[266:02.95]Get him!
[266:15.56]Get him.
[266:18.98]He's right here.
[266:20.26]Get over there fireman.
[266:21.14]Come on.
[266:26.56]Kill.
[266:35.61]Go get him.
[266:37.97]Just don't step on any land mines.
[266:39.93]I'll be alright.
[266:42.51]Um.
[266:48.34]There's no potions?
[266:52.88]How are there no potions?
[266:57.78]He's gonna corpse explode that.
[267:02.35]Alright, die.
[267:10.10]Oh, you dick.
[267:22.20]He was an evil man.
[267:24.34]Yes he was.
[267:29.73]Ah.
[267:51.22]I got these cool things.
[267:59.63]So now it's time to see if this stream is going to continue.
[268:07.90]This is where we figure it out.
[268:10.04]Speaking of figuring it out.
[268:16.28]Do I have any angelic stuff?
[268:17.96]No.
[268:18.14]Okay.
[268:18.50]Okay.
[268:22.81]I just was gonna sneeze, and it went into my body.
[268:26.52]That was... That sucked.
[268:30.96]I was like... It went backwards down into my stomach and shit.
[268:35.84]That was weird.
[268:37.06]I was trying to.
[268:37.66]I don't have any angelic stuff, no.
[268:46.12]Sanders.
[268:50.23]Arctic.
[268:50.97]Not angelic.
[268:53.80]Bands.
[268:55.98]Rathras.
[268:56.74]No.
[268:57.86]No.
[268:58.34]Just a little shitty normal one.
[269:03.60]Just a shitty normal one.
[269:04.72]I do have a shell room.
[269:06.20]That's good.
[269:11.07]What do you need?
[269:15.43]So, talk to Anya before you continue through the Crystalline Passage past the Glacial Trail to proceed up to Mount Ariat.
[269:22.45]Is the sword angelic?
[269:24.05]Wait.
[269:24.25]No, no, no.
[269:24.65]Oh, no.
[269:25.93]You guys confused me for a second.
[269:49.08]Alright, let's go.
[269:55.08]Back to the glacial trail.
[269:56.22]Do I have the waypoint?
[269:59.66]I'm an idiot and didn't get it.
[270:00.62]I bet he can't play with facecam on.
[270:06.74]Oh yeah?
[270:07.31]You're right.
[270:08.17]Travel through the ancient's way to find the ancients at the Ariat summit.
[270:20.73]I did not get... No, I did.
[270:30.76]Thank goodness.
[270:32.10]We want the Glacial Trail, and then we need to go to Mount Ariat.
[270:36.96]And... I'll be in the process of probably saying my goodbyes.
[270:41.12]It was a good run.
[270:43.38]I'm going to try.
[270:45.18]It was a good run.
[270:50.49]You look like a cop.
[270:52.09]That's the first I've ever heard that.
[271:02.02]I think I've walked by it, didn't I?
[271:09.56]We are going to put this on players one.
[271:13.64]Because the ancients are going to be the thing that's going to be nearly impossible for me to do, I think.
[271:23.93]It is very necessary.
[271:24.99]You can call me lame all you want.
[271:32.96]I'm still going- I'm going to survive.
[271:38.68]My Glacial Trail, is that not it?
[271:47.59]Speedwalking.
[271:49.33]Holy fuck.
[271:52.44]Now this is the crystal.
[271:53.14]Where is this?
[271:53.56]Harriet Plateau.
[271:56.48]Nope.
[271:57.24]We need the Glacial Trail.
[271:59.48]You guys good in there?
[272:00.54]You guys alright?
[272:26.17]Alright.
[272:26.55]Everybody's alright.
[272:30.03]Look, we're fine.
[272:35.30]Might get lucky.
[272:35.76]It might just be right here.
[272:38.02]Oh, my fuck.
[272:42.40]Okay, guys, help.
[272:45.76]Friends.
[272:58.98]Skeletal mages keep just dying instantly.
[273:03.02]Warhammer.
[273:07.12]Hmm.
[273:09.72]Eh.
[273:11.60]Okay.
[273:14.10]Okay.
[273:28.82]How are we doing?
[273:29.24]We're still a full team, right?
[273:33.14]Glacial Trail.
[273:36.12]Glacial Trail.
[273:38.84]Not over here.
[273:41.21]Aw, too bad.
[274:01.54]Wait, Ariat Plateau leads to Glacial Trail, does it?
[274:05.34]I thought it was crystalline to glacial.
[274:17.82]Is that true?
[274:19.26]I don't remember.
[274:19.72]I remember it being... There's a crystal?
[274:24.22]Because here's the frozen... frozen river.
[274:27.73]Maybe, yeah, you're right.
[274:28.69]Fuck.
[274:30.37]Harriet Plateau.
[274:31.13]But wasn't Harriet Plateau behind Glacial Trail and the waypoint?
[274:35.01]I always thought that was... Hmm.
[274:40.02]Diablo II Poser.
[274:45.08]Not a real wink.
[274:46.76]I know a real wink when I see one.
[274:47.94]That's not a real one.
[275:00.46]Oh my god.
[275:01.84]I can't just run through that.
[275:03.60]Oh my god.
[275:21.27]Where's Vic?
[275:23.23]I think he's just fighting down there by himself.
[275:26.44]Oh my.
[275:26.98]Look at this.
[275:27.54]He's just getting... Alright, I have to go.
[275:30.99]That's not happening.
[275:31.77]I'm gonna get my team to go in there.
[275:43.27]That's not happening.
[275:56.51]Okay.
[275:58.33]There's that.
[275:58.89]Let's get fire back.
[276:00.24]And let's get mages and go back in.
[276:02.40]Okay.
[276:04.34]Come on.
[276:11.56]Follow me.
[276:13.78]15k away from a wink here.
[276:17.69]Oh, use those points wisely.
[276:22.51]Use them very wisely.
[276:24.01]How may I be of help?
[276:32.33]Here we go.
[276:33.13]One, two, three, in.
[276:37.44]Can you wink anything other than your eye?
[277:00.11]Okay.
[277:01.07]I... I don't... How did I read that?
[277:06.55]I don't know.
[277:07.01]I didn't... I didn't understand until after reading it.
[277:09.76]Whoa!
[277:27.67]They were just sitting here.
[277:30.95]Cestus.
[277:34.47]Alright.
[277:35.73]Ancient's Way.
[277:37.79]Looking for Glacial Trail.
[277:40.62]I think I know where it is.
[277:41.38]I think it's on this side.
[277:44.60]Wait.
[277:47.92]Is it up here?
[277:53.91]I feel like it's not up here.
[278:00.45]I really don't remember.
[278:01.31]I thought it was Glacial Trail to... Hmm.
[278:18.39]Special trail is up top right.
[278:22.15]You mean like this way?
[278:22.87]Or you mean in the... It's been a while.
[278:26.79]I'm trying to remember.
[278:27.77]I think I can run fast.
[278:37.15]It's inside the frozen cave there, right?
[278:41.75]Go to the ancients.
[278:42.41]Yeah, I'm trying to remember where to go.
[278:43.87]I kind of forget.
[278:46.87]I've done this a million times, but I just don't really remember.
[278:50.65]It's crystalline and then into glacial wave, right?
[278:56.05]Crystalline to glacial, and glacial to the summit.
[279:05.96]No, it definitely is.
[279:06.66]Hold on.
[279:14.70]Yeah, I had it right the first time, didn't I?
[279:18.19]I definitely had it right the first time.
[279:20.65]At least I thought I did.
[279:22.03]Yeah, I had it right.
[279:22.95]Alright, let's go.
[279:32.69]Slowly making our way to the ancients.
[279:42.01]I got the shoes.
[279:44.50]Might as well use them.
[279:48.22]Although I want to level up one more time.
[279:51.05]So let's not run through this.
[280:06.72]Saber.
[280:14.52]Don't die?
[280:15.06]I definitely will not die before the ancients.
[280:21.27]I do want to be level 30... I want to be level 34, though.
[280:25.17]If you beat the Ancients, you get 3 to 5 levels.
[280:33.20]So, pretty pog.
[280:37.82]You get like 3 full levels or 4 full levels by doing the Ancients.
[280:53.00]It's pretty fog.
[280:55.90]Look, I'm using Twitch speak.
[280:57.83]I'm using it correctly, too.
[281:03.15]So, at 34, this final point is really going to matter.
[281:07.66]These final points are what are going to potentially determine the end of this whole thing.
[281:21.60]We can't even pog.
[281:22.51]What the fuck are we supposed to do?
[281:27.77]You can pog.
[281:28.61]It just doesn't show up.
[281:31.55]I like reading it.
[281:34.35]I prefer to read it than to see it.
[281:38.13]I like pog.
[281:39.26]I like it.
[281:47.46]This PogChamp exists, but pog is you saying it.
[281:54.96]When you do PogChamp, that's your face.
[281:57.42]That's your... You're not saying anything.
[282:00.88]You're saying pog.
[282:10.11]A little different.
[282:18.89]Come on.
[282:19.15]Let me get to 34 before I go to the ancients.
[282:20.71]Come on.
[282:22.39]Come on.
[282:26.27]This is my face.
[282:27.15]This is not your face.
[282:31.43]I know what your face looks like.
[282:32.65]Not that.
[282:33.97]Dave.
[282:50.53]You guys remember when, um, I wanted to do that joke?
[282:56.31]Where, in the title of the stream, I title the stream, like, Anthony Roberts, come to this stream!
[283:06.85]Or like, this stream- I wanted to do that so bad.
[283:12.00]Dave Smith, we're waiting for you!
[283:14.60]And imagine scrolling down that, and being like, what the fuck is going on?
[283:25.90]Oh, a unique name that is not necessarily like John or like Dave Smith or anything.
[283:42.97]Okay.
[283:57.42]Omega LOL Dave Why is the name Dave funny?
[284:06.01]What's the name?
[284:07.27]Probably should do Omega LOL Dave Still going Aha, Drifter Cavern, nooo
[284:27.22]That means it's on the other side.
[284:28.14]I really wonder if I'm going to be able to do this.
[284:52.16]This is the last real roadblock before Bale.
[284:56.09]That's not true.
[284:57.57]The List of the Tormentor is the last roadblock before Bale.
[285:14.18]Bale, MonkaS.
[285:25.11]There's a chest right there.
[285:26.00]I'll take it!
[285:27.34]Fail, hog.
[285:50.18]I need revives.
[285:50.92]Give me the chest.
[285:55.28]What a... Ooh, I heard a skull.
[285:58.88]Why did I hear a skull?
[286:00.36]Oh, it's down here.
[286:01.04]Why are you not some... What the fuck is going on?
[286:25.08]don't worry we will level up before I do the ancients I just want to because if when you go into the ancients you get one shot if you try to portal out the whole encounter resets so you pick you put a portal although you otherwise have to run the whole thing get yeah this is gonna suck
[286:50.15]It has to be down here.
[286:54.89]Remember, we'll literally never say penis.
[286:56.61]He's too pure for this world.
[286:59.23]I've said that word a thousand times.
[287:00.62]It's anatomy.
[287:01.86]Who cares?
[287:19.71]Guys, it's alright.
[287:28.01]Save Vagina.
[287:28.74]That's Anatomy 2, right?
[287:29.86]Yeah.
[287:34.80]What's the matter?
[287:35.48]I don't get it.
[287:57.51]Wink already!
[288:00.63]You wanna see where my gamer face is?
[288:03.81]This is where I have to pay attention.
[288:05.45]Right there.
[288:10.89]Just pretend I'm on face again.
[288:18.01]Wait, where the hell is this?
[288:20.67]Wait, what the fuck?
[288:23.42]I need the ancient's way.
[288:25.93]Wait, is it Frozen Tundra?
[288:30.74]Did I miss one?
[288:34.04]Is it Frozen Tundra?
[288:37.40]Then to... I don't remember.
[288:42.44]Frozen Tundra?
[288:44.48]And then Ancient's Way.
[288:48.80]Yeah.
[288:51.20]Goddammit, yeah.
[288:52.32]Ancient's Way.
[288:53.82]Alright, Ancient's Way.
[288:54.54]Let's find it.
[288:59.37]I actually cannot just go for this.
[289:09.14]I might be able just to run to get it.
[289:10.28]It's like right around here.
[289:15.50]Look at me.
[289:15.86]Look at how fast I am.
[289:18.28]No one will catch me.
[289:19.72]I have 65% increased speed.
[289:22.87]Good luck.
[289:25.47]Ain't nobody catching me.
[289:36.45]I could run a mile!
[289:41.76]Fireman's gonna protect you.
[289:44.10]You'll be alright.
[290:02.61]Although, I have to be careful I don't run out of stamina.
[290:07.36]I will not get hurt unless I have no stamina.
[290:22.41]Here we go.
[290:23.37]It should be right here.
[290:24.41]Oh!
[290:28.41]Whoa!
[290:30.19]Here it is, right here.
[290:30.81]Alright.
[290:31.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[290:33.00]Do this right.
[290:33.50]Do this right.
[290:33.90]Do this right.
[290:34.30]Do this smart.
[290:36.46]This is where I die!
[290:37.12]This is smart.
[290:50.23]Like anyone's gonna click on curses.
[290:53.13]Where do you wanna go?
[291:10.58]You've had... Stretching.
[291:16.12]You've had 34 opportunities to click a curse, and you haven't done it once, so... Don't... Trying to get me killed.
[291:26.36]It's alright.
[292:22.24]A little late for teeth, isn't it?
[292:24.68]Apparently not to 48% of everybody watching the channel right now.
[292:34.51]Seems like the perfect time.
[292:44.21]Vitality.
[292:46.31]Cool.
[293:04.93]Four to six damage.
[293:06.01]Four teeth.
[293:13.84]Look at these potions.
[293:20.92]Okay.
[293:24.99]Let's go get an army.
[293:30.66]Dude, that's like 24 damage.
[293:34.56]It's pretty, it's pretty sick.
[293:45.88]That should be enough.
[293:47.08]Actually, yeah, that should be okay.
[293:49.08]As long as I have like five people, it should be alright.
[294:07.34]Okay... Where we at?
[294:14.20]Where we at, guys?
[294:14.68]We good?
[294:16.10]We're good.
[294:31.85]Kill these champions, they might drop good shit.
[294:43.15]I'm overburdened.
[295:01.72]Ancient's Way.
[295:04.32]We are the spirits of the Nephilim.
[295:28.36]Cool.
[295:31.34]I'm gonna have to use it again.
[295:36.06]Amulet.
[296:02.57]Should I fill the whole Ancient's Way area with trash and do Iron Golem again?
[296:07.30]Because you have to activate it.
[296:16.19]What if I just drop like a hundred weapons on the ground?
[296:26.41]I think that's the only way this is doable.
[296:31.69]Unless, I mean, Vik might be able to handle it.
[296:37.41]Vik actually probably can do it.
[296:38.96]As long as I keep him healed.
[296:56.55]Leveled up too, good.
[297:02.13]Ow.
[297:04.31]Big Vic energy.
[297:05.35]That's right.
[297:06.43]Who is killing Fire Golem so hard?
[297:16.60]Someone's destroying him.
[297:29.41]He's just got his ass kicked.
[297:37.80]Icy Cellar.
[297:38.56]That's not correct.
[297:50.42]That means it's over here.
[297:51.42]Marriott Summit.
[298:05.57]I'm dead.
[298:18.97]I forgot... That's... Okay, let me explain something very quickly.
[298:25.23]Um... You put that there on... If you're not playing hardcore... Because...
[298:34.45]Portals are not allowed here, but you can come back through the portal and walk in again.
[298:40.29]I can do this.
[298:48.22]But if this is started... I can't use it.
[298:58.82]You have to do it in one shot.
[299:04.48]Oh my god.
[299:05.24]I didn't get any waypoints.
[299:21.23]I didn't get any waypoints.
[299:22.09]I had to run the whole thing.
[299:22.89]Fuck.
[299:24.73]How did that... That was just... Two unfortunate things in a row.
[299:28.79]I could leave and just come back.
[299:31.05]Why did I use... I was just showing people... I don't know.
[299:33.87]I thought I had like a thousand.
[299:36.67]Okay.
[299:38.85]I know... It ain't gonna end like that.
[300:15.77]What happened to Big Vic Energy?
[300:18.42]I mean, at the end of the day... At the end of the day, I have to just go for it, and I'm... Okay, let me ask a question.
[300:26.76]Am I allowed to pour it out?
[300:28.11]Because if I use a portal, everything resets.
[300:32.81]Am I allowed to do that?
[300:37.50]No.
[300:38.24]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[301:01.53]Open the fucking door!
[301:09.11]We'll do a proper pull.
[301:10.29]Let's see if I'm allowed to portal out of the ancients.
[301:15.05]You're supposed to do it in one go.
[301:22.65]Ancients way.
[301:27.73]Watch that stamina.
[302:01.79]Alright.
[302:05.05]I just have to get up there.
[302:05.93]Just get up there!
[302:09.36]Fucking god.
[302:17.20]These skeletons are getting beat so badly.
[302:21.43]The skeletons aren't good anymore.
[302:23.29]They used to be good.
[302:24.57]What happened to them?
[302:26.21]They used to be so good!
[302:27.53]They can't take any punches anymore.
[302:31.14]Oh shit.
[302:40.74]Alright, this is blocked off.
[302:48.68]Chad Barbarian Ancients versus the Virgin Bone Boys.
[303:06.25]Not that way.
[303:06.93]It's the other side.
[303:12.03]Is it?
[303:12.77]Yep.
[303:18.48]Here it is.
[303:18.96]The summit.
[303:21.12]Let's hang out right here.
[303:22.48]Put a portal.
[303:27.44]Let's go for it.
[303:28.34]Let's get a full team.
[303:29.32]I might just be overthinking this.
[303:32.47]We might be able to do this.
[303:34.53]We might just be able to do this.
[303:36.89]With a full team.
[303:37.87]It's possible.
[303:49.72]I'll give it a try.
[303:51.50]I want a full team and I want two moon lords.
[304:07.13]Okay, how many we got?
[304:13.73]Four?
[304:14.05]We got everybody?
[304:15.77]We got two moon lords?
[304:19.48]We have two something.
[304:21.78]Let's go.
[304:22.82]Let's do it.
[304:23.58]I'm ready.
[304:24.70]You ready?
[304:26.09]Let's go.
[304:26.41]First try.
[304:28.45]Oh no, it's Bugleberry.
[304:46.14]Focus one focus one
[305:21.39]Get a Moon Lord, come on!
[305:34.94]Somebody said E3 gameplay.
[305:41.62]Kill this one!
[305:47.16]Somebody's dead!
[305:49.78]Who's dead?
[305:51.39]They're both dead.
[305:52.17]Oh, we did it.
[305:52.95]We definitely did it.
[305:53.63]It's over.
[305:53.97]I just did it.
[305:56.51]How many levels?
[305:57.42]What level am I?
[305:59.54]34?
[305:59.56]35.
[306:00.24]Oh, that was a bogus.
[306:01.50]I did it.
[306:01.78]That was not even bad.
[306:02.78]Yeah, I was overthinking that.
[306:07.32]Kale Bale.
[306:22.68]Let's do it.
[306:45.14]No one's going to click on curses.
[306:46.56]You know it.
[306:54.19]Respect skills before bail, please.
[306:56.37]I can't do that.
[306:57.73]That defeats the whole purpose of these streams.
[307:02.37]Could I just go delete everything you guys have picked and do a real build and kill bail?
[307:08.68]But no, this is hardcore.
[307:11.36]Chat picks every skill and stat.
[307:14.00]Can I beat the game on hardcore?
[307:16.34]It's important.
[307:19.23]It's important.
[307:30.61]Alright, it's revive.
[307:31.57]That's three revives.
[307:42.75]Very cool.
[307:51.38]These might be one of the... There's probably only about four or five more levels left in the remainder of the whole game.
[308:05.19]Chat, get bone mastery, you zoomers.
[308:17.50]Thankfully, vitality is still on the brain, so that's good.
[308:20.66]Okay, let's go.
[308:23.34]Let's do it.
[308:23.76]Three summons.
[308:31.33]Next one is four summons.
[308:43.62]the world stone keep Bael the gates of Secheron have been closed for eons you will not open them now come on Vik I need you down here
[309:15.97]That was easy.
[309:17.81]Where else don't keep level 2?
[309:19.89]We need the... We need... Very important, we need the waypoint.
[309:31.10]It's going to be a normal enemy that kills you.
[309:33.90]No, it's not.
[309:34.54]I've gotten this far.
[309:36.90]This is, what, hours?
[309:38.02]It's been five hours.
[309:38.94]Is this the third or fourth Diablo II hardcore stream?
[309:44.98]Third, right?
[309:48.00]Or is it fourth?
[309:48.54]It's the third.
[309:53.04]So in like 14 hours, 15, 16 hours of gameplay, do you think that at this point a greater hellspawn is going to kill me?
[310:03.68]I mean, that field play is awesome.
[310:08.89]Need more summons.
[310:20.79]Free.
[310:21.26]Good.
[310:25.14]We need the waypoint.
[310:27.74]These guys do explode, so I can't see your concern.
[310:36.19]You're going to get too full of yourself and you're going to get cornered.
[310:38.47]I don't know if I will.
[310:45.12]I'd like to level up once or twice before Bael, which the Throne Room should.
[310:48.94]The Throne Room is an EXP heaven.
[311:01.17]And we get to hear the laugh.
[311:02.69]The best part of all of Act 5.
[311:19.27]I thought you were one of my friends.
[311:20.37]Get out of here.
[311:20.95]I thought that guy was on my team.
[311:32.26]I need to do a potion run here in a minute.
[311:39.76]Hey, listen.
[311:40.10]It's the login screen.
[311:58.57]Got a full team?
[311:59.13]I need a mage.
[311:59.79]I don't think there's anything over here.
[312:02.49]Bastards so hard.
[312:12.98]Nope.
[312:18.74]Me angry.
[312:19.56]Me want teeth.
[312:24.05]Your rage is going to consume you.
[312:28.26]Waypoint or level 3?
[312:30.10]Waypoint.
[312:30.62]Alright, we are now good to go.
[312:32.12]This is the final waypoint of the game.
[312:38.32]Very useful if I ever want to do this again and come back and kill Bill for any reason.
[312:51.14]So it's down bottom right.
[312:53.33]Like, this way.
[313:03.92]I'm scared of... List of the Tormentor.
[313:07.22]I like Kill Bill music.
[313:13.24]Why?
[313:14.53]Oh, it's Kill Bill music.
[313:28.11]What do you want me to play?
[313:29.69]Oh, here we go.
[313:30.19]Alright.
[313:35.60]One more level, and we're at the throne room.
[313:37.92]You want me to play, like, the theme song?
[313:42.05]Hold on, you want me to play the Kill Bill theme song and have me get muted?
[313:45.73]The apex of this whole Scream series.
[313:59.08]I don't think that's a good idea.
[314:01.64]Oh, we're gonna have Diablo music.
[314:16.05]Goes...
[314:31.60]throne room we're probably gonna level up two or three times in the throne room at least once it's not this way so what the hell am I even doing down here does Mike just vibrate or am I imagining it it probably did um why fucking not hey don't pay attention and just run down a hallway what what am I thinking what are you doing
[315:11.22]There it is.
[315:23.99]I can see it.
[315:24.55]Wall hacks.
[315:28.85]We just need a good portal.
[315:32.00]And we need to pray.
[315:48.63]The Throne of Destruction.
[315:53.91]Kill Vale's minions.
[315:56.85]And then kill Vale.
[316:09.18]This is gonna be fun.
[316:11.38]Win or lose?
[316:13.27]Don't matter.
[316:14.79]Win or lose.
[316:18.21]We made it.
[316:18.61]10 community subs from Furt Bernandes.
[316:23.00]Thank you, Burt.
[316:23.80]For Furt.
[316:24.46]Furt Bernandes.
[316:26.40]Thanks a lot, Burt.
[316:36.14]Appreciate the subs.
[316:37.82]Thanks for the 10.
[316:38.44]Alright, I need potions for this.
[316:47.60]Good potions, not these shitty ones.
[316:51.00]Good potions.
[317:09.20]Okay.
[317:10.70]This part is, uh, you fight waves of enemies.
[317:13.36]Just clear it out first.
[317:17.12]It's kind of a pain in the ass.
[317:21.63]Adventures of Flying Jack by Kevin MacLeod.
[317:26.61]No.
[317:29.11]Let's do it.
[317:30.75]You're gonna see him.
[317:32.15]He's scary looking.
[317:33.87]I have to warn you.
[317:34.65]He's scary looking.
[317:58.00]Telling me to open my eyes?
[317:59.02]Alright, I'll tell you when to open your eyes.
[318:02.10]So you won't see the scary monster.
[318:06.19]Open them now.
[318:19.84]Alright, everybody get in there.
[318:21.18]He spawns people right here.
[318:24.16]Get in!
[318:24.36]This is the EXP heaven.
[318:31.93]Although there's only one person in the game.
[318:33.67]Me.
[318:40.13]We're good?
[318:49.55]I feel much stronger.
[318:50.37]Good.
[318:50.77]Are you outpacing me?
[318:52.37]Am I being outleveled by my apprentice?
[319:01.84]Poison sucks.
[319:03.74]That was Act 2.
[319:04.92]Here comes Act 3.
[319:07.36]Council.
[319:38.02]Hey, why don't we go out the back door and make some new friends?
[320:28.61]Okay, a couple of mages.
[320:31.69]Let's go!
[320:32.51]Okay, we have a full team of friends.
[320:40.35]Somebody said that Fireman was bad.
[320:41.77]What are they?
[320:49.47]What are they?
[320:49.91]Nuts?
[320:52.41]Back into it.
[320:53.86]Focus 1.
[320:58.74]Revive a council member.
[320:59.88]No, don't blow him up.
[321:00.64]They're made out of ice.
[321:01.56]Oh, God.
[321:09.10]There's nobody to revive?
[321:10.32]How?
[321:15.52]Revive a council member.
[321:17.07]Finally.
[321:17.53]Here comes Act 4.
[321:23.77]I don't have...
[321:52.14]These skeletons are worthless, but they take one hit of damage each.
[321:57.97]That means that's seven swings that I don't have to see or the other actually good companions don't have to see.
[322:22.90]Okay.
[322:24.85]Let's go.
[322:28.67]I need mana.
[322:29.57]Let's see if I can get through Act.
[322:34.27]I'm so fucking dead.
[322:36.67]Uh-oh.
[322:37.81]Hey, at least you got to see Bale.
[322:40.41]Have a good night, everybody.
[322:46.73]Still have a council member, so...
[322:53.95]One, two, three.
[322:58.16]Alright, everybody stuff in the middle.
[323:01.28]Get the council member in there.
[323:02.48]He's the strongest one.
[323:03.48]Get in there!
[323:18.71]Oh!
[323:21.35]Kill somebody!
[323:22.93]If I can revive someone... Good, there we go.
[323:52.69]Look at these revives doing work.
[324:05.35]Okay, this is it.
[324:05.84]This is the last wave.
[324:07.90]And it's the worst one.
[324:08.74]I have three... Stay in there.
[324:11.66]Okay.
[324:23.67]Come on.
[324:24.19]Vic's dead.
[324:25.17]Vic's dead?
[324:30.17]I still have my three... Come on.
[324:40.85]Kill one so I can bring one back to life.
[324:42.72]Anyone.
[324:44.38]Nobody even has any health taken away.
[324:46.04]Get away from me.
[324:53.79]You tried your best.
[324:54.53]You tried your best.
[324:57.03]You couldn't hit anything.
[325:01.99]And now I'm going in there with no beefy minions.
[325:15.18]You shouldn't be giving Blizzard any... Blizzard any what?
[325:21.35]Any advertisements.
[325:24.04]I've kind of been talking shit about Blizzard for five streams.
[325:35.65]I think every time we've talked about anything to do with Blizzard, I've made a comment about how bad of a company they are. ...
[325:53.52]Blizzard North made this game.
[325:55.26]That's like a totally different company.
[326:02.30]I'm not... I'm gonna get fucking wrecked in here.
[326:17.49]Yeah, go to River of Flame.
[326:18.55]That's a good idea.
[326:26.45]I really want to kill this thing.
[326:30.38]Blizzard North.
[326:32.88]Yeah, that's a sad tale.
[326:35.76]Blizzard North made Diablo and Diablo II.
[326:39.14]And then the entire company was liquidated.
[326:43.22]For some reason.
[326:45.66]Hold on, let me... Do I have anything?
[326:50.11]Blizzard just got rid of Blizzard North.
[326:51.81]They were just like, yeah, we don't want Blizzard North anymore.
[326:54.61]Who's gonna get rid of him?
[327:06.27]They used to be called Condor before Blizzard bought them, yeah.
[327:10.65]Then we got Hellgate London.
[327:14.75]Yeah... But they were responsible for Torchlight, weren't they?
[327:19.60]Wasn't one of them?
[327:20.96]Didn't one of them go on to... One of the two or three people that made Diablo go on to do Torchlight?
[327:32.11]They just, the, the, the, it's like we talked about this before.
[327:35.28]It's like Chrono Trigger, you had this perfect team.
[327:38.26]And they all, from the artists, to the designers, to the programmers, to the people making the engine, like you had this group.
[327:45.72]And they all were really good, and then you split them all up, and they all do their own version of the same thing.
[327:50.71]And it's not as good as when you were all together doing the same thing together.
[327:57.95]Unfortunately.
[328:00.81]That's why we'll never get another Chrono Trigger or a sequel.
[328:03.79]Because they're all split up and they're all completely different companies in different places.
[328:08.00]So... We will never get a true sequel to any of these games, unfortunately.
[328:15.72]God, I hate video games.
[328:23.53]That was funny.
[328:24.73]Alright, I need to go to Act 4 and revive... This is a fucking... This is a joke.
[328:30.94]Alright.
[328:31.68]Wait, I need Vic.
[328:33.98]I'm nothing without Vic, so... Let's revive a few people here.
[328:52.07]I think I can actually go try to fight Bael without fighting these things.
[328:56.57]Let's see if I can get a couple of Bisknights.
[329:04.49]I'm pretty sure I can just run into the gate.
[329:12.21]Bisknights are really good.
[329:13.17]Oh, I got a bug.
[329:20.47]I'm on another Bisknight.
[329:24.52]I'll take these three.
[329:25.16]Okay, one more Abyss Knight and I'll be good to go.
[329:38.15]Should be alright.
[329:38.75]And an Ogre.
[329:41.19]No, I want all Ogres.
[329:42.23]Stop blowing them up!
[329:48.89]Three Ogres.
[329:54.17]Don't blow him up.
[329:54.91]I need him.
[330:00.01]Oh my god, you fucking idiots.
[330:07.04]Alright, let's go.
[330:12.26]I'm just going to... I got an ogre.
[330:18.72]An ogre.
[330:28.48]I have two bugs.
[330:29.68]Two small bugs.
[330:42.35]God damn it.
[330:43.79]Fuck it.
[330:44.13]Let's go.
[330:44.67]Who cares?
[330:45.17]Let's go.
[330:47.61]Whatever.
[330:48.79]I'm going in.
[330:50.33]I'm going in.
[331:01.70]Why was the portal in the middle?
[331:03.92]Why was the portal in the middle?
[331:11.35]Why was the portal in the center of everybody?
[331:19.46]Look at all the money I dropped.
[331:33.49]uh alright am I insane or wasn't the portal down here the portal was down here when did it come up here oh okay three it was wasn't it
[332:03.08]Free Winx redeemed.
[332:05.20]Check the VOD.
[332:05.82]You moved it.
[332:11.01]Did I?
[332:11.45]But why would I?
[332:12.33]Okay.
[332:13.11]I don't know.
[332:13.43]Would I have been this dumb to put... I wouldn't have put it like right in the middle.
[332:18.21]At least like... I wouldn't have done that.
[332:24.13]You were rushing.
[332:25.29]It's because I got two maggots.
[332:28.33]And I just wanted to go in and...
[332:32.92]Your deeds of valor will be remembered.
[332:34.38]You have died.
[332:34.96]Tommy Lee Bones.
[332:46.94]Dead.
[332:48.42]You cannot create or join with a dead hardcore character.
[332:51.20]That was a good run.
[332:59.84]Alright.
[333:02.20]That was... At least you got to see Vale.
[333:04.12]Take a pee break, we'll be right back.
[333:10.04]See what I'm gonna do.
[333:12.07]I... What time is it?
[333:14.53]No, actually, I have to leave.
[333:15.65]Wait, it's been five and a half hours.
[333:17.69]Holy shit, okay.
[333:18.81]I have to go.
[333:22.31]Not immediately, but I have to leave, like, soonish.
[333:26.13]Uh, let's go pee.
[333:27.29]I'll be right back.
[333:30.02]We will settle.
[333:34.69]We can hang out for like another 45 minutes or so.
[333:38.79]Just about.
[333:40.66]See what we can do in that time.
[333:41.56]I'll be right back when we go pee.
[333:45.34]Thank you.
[334:31.73]Thank you.
[335:37.26]Bro, I'm so late.
[335:38.28]Did he beat the huge red guy yet?
[335:40.13]I did, actually.
[335:47.35]Uh... That's the last one.
[335:54.19]I'm going in.
[335:55.81]My theory... Okay, here's my theory with what happened right there.
[335:59.87]I was gonna try to pull them out because you don't have to kill them.
[336:05.31]And I figured if I pull him out, I can get into the chamber where Bael was, make a portal in the chamber, and then figure out what the hell I was gonna do.
[336:15.98]I guess I made a portal in the middle of everybody.
[336:19.34]Somehow.
[336:26.71]Did I, like, panic or something halfway through that?
[336:28.51]I don't know.
[336:28.83]Alright, let's, uh... Tommy Lee Bones is level 35.
[336:36.79]He's gone.
[336:38.47]That was a lot of fun, though.
[336:40.67]I did not think I was gonna get that far.
[336:45.43]Not a chance in hell.
[336:48.91]Sounded like you were getting murdered in real life, too.
[336:55.63]Yeah, and I'm gonna call it here.
[336:59.03]I might as well.
[337:01.53]Just because this stream was only gonna be about four to six hours.
[337:04.61]Because I have to go meet... I have to go meet friends.
[337:10.73]Some of you guys don't know, but this is the stream where I have to say goodbye for a little while.
[337:20.74]I will be back next week.
[337:27.07]It's probably on Friday afternoon.
[337:30.36]You will not see me for about six days.
[337:34.36]I have a group of friends that are coming up from Boston.
[337:37.94]First time any of them have, some of them at least, have been out here.
[337:42.75]First time any of them have come to visit me in particular, except for one of them has come out once, but for the most part, no.
[337:50.77]So, we are going to have some enjoyable friend time.
[337:57.25]So you will not see me again.
[337:59.23]They are here.
[337:59.91]They knew, you know, obviously that I wasn't going to be available until a little bit later.
[338:05.93]But it is now later.
[338:08.94]So at 8 p.m.
[338:10.96]Pacific is when I need to essentially meet them.
[338:17.76]I'm just snorting cocaine.
[338:19.50]No, I do not do drugs.
[338:20.87]Do not do them.
[338:25.60]I thought we were your friends.
[338:28.12]Yeah.
[338:34.31]But we'll do the bits.
[338:35.69]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[338:37.77]If you've taken off, thanks for joining me these last five days.
[338:43.68]These streams have been very fun.
[338:45.38]I've had a blast on all of them.
[338:48.72]For those of you Asura's Wrath fans that thought maybe today, if we had time, we were going to do DLC, I was under the impression that if I didn't kill Diablo and I just couldn't do it and I died within like two hours that we would have done it.
[339:02.26]But there's still a lot of Xbox stuff to do.
[339:05.23]Asura's Wrath DLC will be tacked onto one of the Xbox 360 games when we go back to it.
[339:18.48]When am I going to stream next?
[339:19.60]I'll be back on Friday.
[339:22.34]So, Friday the 7th is when I will return.
[339:28.08]Don't forget about me.
[339:30.02]Don't forget about me.
[339:36.77]And that's going to call it tonight.
[339:43.95]Time to rewatch the Sorcery VODs.
[339:48.39]Oh, that was some of my first streams.
[339:51.00]It was a lot of fun.
[339:53.88]As always, thanks for joining me, everybody.
[339:55.14]Let's do the bits.
[339:57.98]Thanks for joining me again.
[339:59.37]A lot of people watched these Diablo II streams.
[340:05.61]I'm happy about that.
[340:07.93]I'm happy that people are still interested.
[340:13.22]This is like one of my favorite games ever.
[340:16.22]And it's nice to share that with people.
[340:18.32]Play Diablo 3?
[340:26.03]I'm not going to play Diablo 3 on stream.
[340:31.65]But... Thank you.
[340:34.66]I will see you all next week.
[340:37.40]But...
[340:39.19]Isaac thanks for the 500 bits!
[340:40.13]Hey Jeremy, wanted to thank you again for the laughs from last night's stream.
[340:43.69]I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
[340:47.27]Yeah, alright.
[340:48.47]Last night's stream was very funny.
[340:51.75]When I got to the point where we were 10 hours in, 10 and a half hours, and Iron Man did the royal flush and hit his face on the bar... I was gone.
[341:01.44]I literally was in outer space.
[341:02.90]I was gone.
[341:06.46]That's just so stupid.
[341:09.49]I loved every second of it, yeah.
[341:10.73]I had a lot of fun.
[341:11.39]It's a great game.
[341:12.12]It's one of the best skating games.
[341:16.85]Glad you enjoyed it.
[341:19.09]S. Kilo, thanks for the 300 bits.
[341:20.15]And you had a...
[341:46.59]Massive... I had very large hands.
[341:51.63]Weird.
[341:55.17]Thank you.
[341:57.53]Thank you for thanking people for their dreams.
[342:00.53]Hey, thank you for your dream.
[342:02.71]Thanks for the dream.
[342:03.43]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[342:05.31]Appreciate it.
[342:08.57]Don't eat macaroni and cheese after 11 o'clock.
[342:16.58]Silent Serenity, thanks for 250.
[342:18.24]I once sold my soul to a guy on TF2 for a couple of reclaimed.
[342:22.48]He emailed me a contract to sign and everything.
[342:32.85]Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for 500 bits.
[342:34.95]I heard you looked hot today.
[342:36.80]Read about it in a Discord chat.
[342:38.84]I hope it's true, but I can't stay.
[342:40.34]Have a good stream.
[342:49.59]Well, I don't know.
[342:51.21]You may never know if that was true or not.
[342:59.77]Uh, 50 community subs.
[343:00.83]Let's talk about it one more time.
[343:03.31]Zixia dropped 50.
[343:06.37]Monster sub drop earlier.
[343:11.05]Thank you so much, Zixia.
[343:14.29]Say it right.
[343:15.23]Ugh!
[343:23.04]Say the name right.
[343:28.13]I'll always say people's names wrong.
[343:33.93]I'm sorry.
[343:36.03]Say my name right.
[343:38.17]I can't.
[343:40.57]Ikiko Morris Sunday.
[343:44.51]Zixia.
[343:45.25]I can't do it.
[343:46.81]People in chat keep calling me Morris.
[343:53.96]Wait.
[343:55.90]Akiko Morris Sunday.
[344:01.16]It's not Morris.
[344:10.67]Dude, people keep calling me fucking Morris, man.
[344:16.41]Like, get it right!
[344:18.75]Sorry.
[344:20.63]But, regardless, it was a shitload of subs.
[344:24.98]A ton.
[344:28.22]No one's ever expected to even sub to this channel, let alone give 50 other subscriptions to other people.
[344:37.34]Thank you.
[344:43.25]We had TheShroom gave 370.
[344:47.07]Thank you, TheShroom.
[344:48.96]Yo, Jerma, you and Star have made me laugh so damn much since I've been in middle school when I should be doing homework.
[344:54.78]Now I'm developed.
[344:56.94]Now I'm getting... Oh, I thought you said now I'm developing.
[344:59.24]Now I'm getting deployed to the Middle East.
[345:02.97]I'm just getting rid of the last few bits I have.
[345:05.55]Y'all deserve so much more.
[345:06.85]I hope you see this message and understand all you've done for me and countless others that have been here for so long, even the ones just starting to watch.
[345:15.76]I wish you the best of luck.
[345:18.10]Take care of yourself.
[345:21.94]Thank you so much for being part of this community.
[345:29.21]If anybody gets anything from these streams, I say it a lot, but it's true.
[345:31.79]If you get anything from it, good.
[345:34.49]Very good.
[345:35.93]Very, very, very good.
[345:45.39]Take care of yourself.
[345:49.07]I wish you the best.
[345:56.08]I missed this.
[345:58.32]I missed this message here.
[346:00.14]It was $50 earlier.
[346:01.46]I don't know.
[346:01.90]It must have been in the middle of something weird.
[346:05.08]5,000 bits from ButtSniffingGeorge.
[346:09.04]He said, Jeremy, I've been watching you since you uploaded a TFT video to LeptoOne's channel in 2011 when I was 12.
[346:16.49]And I want to say thank you for all the content.
[346:19.61]I also wanted to embarrass you.
[346:20.77]LeptoOne.
[346:28.16]We actually talked about Lepto-1 recently.
[346:34.90]Lepto-1... I mean, to be completely honest, that was a pretty big reason why anybody watched my channel when I had like 100, like 200, 300 subs.
[346:51.61]I was getting maybe like 500 to 1,000 views a video.
[346:55.14]And he was getting like 5,000 to 10,000 views a video.
[347:01.44]Maybe a little bit more.
[347:02.34]And it was like, holy shit.
[347:06.36]And, I mean, that did a lot of good early on for the channel, which is the most important thing.
[347:12.78]Going from one sub to 100 subs is way harder than going from 10,000 to 50,000.
[347:21.01]That initial first 1,000 subs on YouTube is very, very hard to get.
[347:32.49]So, I mean, it did a lot.
[347:33.75]It helped a lot.
[347:37.39]No shit.
[347:39.97]Alright, ban that guy.
[347:42.77]Hey, we got a wink.
[347:54.60]I wonder how long it's gonna take before I get really sick and tired of doing that.
[347:59.52]You know what I mean?
[348:01.22]At what point is this gonna be, like, when am I gonna not wanna do this anymore?
[348:08.21]Like, oh, let me turn on my webcam and wink into the camera.
[348:11.45]I wonder.
[348:11.79]I'm going to give it like 30 days and see how I feel.
[348:20.77]But yeah, you linked my Combat Engineer Lakeside video from Lepter1's channel.
[348:29.43]I mean, it's not really... It's not going to embarrass me.
[348:32.01]It's not...
[348:35.32]Because this is just like 10 years ago now.
[348:38.35]This is almost a decade old.
[348:49.78]10 years.
[348:50.12]A 10 year old video.
[348:52.56]Here's the link for it.
[348:55.42]I mean, I don't really want to watch it, because it's, I mean, it's 10 years old, and we've watched 10-year-old videos before, and I'm just like, ugh, it's alright, it's good.
[349:05.15]It's okay.
[349:07.05]Another wink?
[349:07.79]What is going on?
[349:11.79]I'm sorry, I'm already sick of doing it.
[349:15.39]It took, how long, took like two weeks?
[349:20.41]It's staying, though.
[349:30.98]It's not going anywhere.
[349:33.88]The worst part about this is somebody is always going to be saving... ...channel points for the wink.
[349:40.23]So if I ever get rid of the wink... ...it's gonna be really bad.
[349:45.45]Because somebody's gonna be mad because like there's always gonna be a cycling saver for saving wink points.
[350:10.35]Anyways, thank you butt sniffing George Thanks for being around for a decade Let us get the subs rolling.
[350:25.35]I'm gonna bump you again.
[350:26.83]I'm just I'm just bumping you all day, huh?
[350:29.74]I Just keep bumping you in the face
[350:36.82]Please don't stop the wink.
[350:37.82]I'm almost there.
[350:38.86]You almost add enough points.
[350:41.72]Why the fuck did I read that?
[350:43.98]What the fuck am I doing?
[350:55.85]Thanks all the subs.
[350:56.51]We had a lot of community subs tonight.
[351:00.05]Appreciate it, all of you.
[351:08.23]The community subs from New Year's Eve have turned over, as you can imagine.
[351:13.35]But, surprisingly enough, a ton of people that were gifted subs on that night stayed.
[351:24.58]Thank you guys.
[351:29.48]Over 10k?
[351:30.16]Not anymore.
[351:35.22]The channel sits at 8,300 subs.
[351:44.90]Which is an absolute huge amount.
[351:46.76]Because you've got to remember, before New Year's Eve, it was like 6,000.
[351:57.31]so New Year's Eve had thousands of community subs and for that many people after to stay on it's crazy that's a huge retention rate for somebody staying subscribed so I wanted to give you an update on that because I know we I've talked about a few times hey we're almost at like a we're at like we
[352:24.27]I've got 10,000 subs.
[352:25.59]I'm at 11,000 subs, but... You know, I want to make sure everyone's... I don't want you guys to think that I'm like, Hey, we're almost at 12,000.
[352:34.51]Pretty good, huh?
[352:35.19]Let's go, go, go.
[352:41.32]This was kind of an interesting piece of data.
[352:43.48]I thought you guys might want to know.
[352:51.11]Numbers go up hyper.
[352:54.25]A thousand of your subs of mine.
[352:55.77]Give them back.
[352:56.85]I kind of can't, but... No, seriously, thanks, guys.
[353:02.67]5,000 subs was a huge milestone.
[353:04.33]I didn't think that it would be more than that ever.
[353:07.32]And here we are.
[353:10.32]Thank you.
[353:11.66]Scam train?
[353:12.20]No, I don't have scam trains turned on.
[353:14.04]Pipe train, whatever.
[353:19.34]Potion dweller, thanks for the $2.50.
[353:20.70]Attention, chat.
[353:21.72]Save up your winks.
[353:22.40]I would like to have an ultimate wink.
[353:24.97]Where we all cash in our winks one after the other in two months.
[353:29.98]Start saving your points.
[353:31.34]Let's organize and make him wink endlessly.
[353:36.48]That would be such a... That would be such a bad stream.
[353:39.95]But... You spend your points the way you want to spend them.
[353:53.36]If you want to spend your points...
[353:56.56]If you want to spend your currency wherever you want, you absolutely can.
[354:05.15]Two blinks so it's two winks at once.
[354:15.99]What do you mean, oh god?
[354:18.83]What are you talking about?
[354:19.47]I said you can use your currency for whatever you want.
[354:22.28]You can use your winks however.
[354:23.62]Why is everybody monkaS-ing?
[354:32.99]Oh.
[354:33.89]Sorry about that.
[354:34.45]Small world, huh?
[355:00.68]Anyways, here's a link to a member showing off some of their Flatland tricks.
[355:17.26]Let's see.
[355:18.66]This guy's on bath salts, apparently.
[355:20.40]Hold on, let me turn this music off.
[355:29.72]No, it's not like a joke video, just that's the title of the video.
[355:34.71]Matt Tomasello, aka Rodney Mullen on bath salt.
[355:48.96]This is just here.
[355:51.56]What the fuck?
[355:53.28]Okay, the cow...
[355:58.54]The cow throwing the rock at the crowd of people was saved here.
[356:03.75]That was when Murius was, like, throwing shit and breaking stuff.
[356:08.07]Alright, let's take a look.
[356:13.03]Oh, free tax!
[356:13.99]Pay zero dollars to file!
[356:15.35]That's a pretty good trick.
[356:17.61]That actually sounds nice.
[356:36.20]Does it have no- there's no wheels?
[356:39.50]That board is broken in half!
[356:43.25]What?
[356:45.23]Is this board broken?
[356:46.31]Or is that separated?
[357:02.00]Hold on.
[357:02.84]Is this guy a skateboarder or is he a magician?
[357:06.26]Is this like a magic guy?
[357:08.02]These are magic tricks.
[357:14.95]He has two boards in one.
[357:16.45]He has like a fake tearaway board that turns into a real board.
[357:29.98]All of a sudden he just does a royal flush.
[357:36.62]What?
[357:37.02]How do you even do that?
[357:38.16]You just said not even possible.
[357:39.30]Humans can't do that.
[357:40.15]It's like gravity doesn't even work that way.
[357:41.79]Don't break it.
[357:49.77]Wait, did a smaller skateboard come out of his skateboard?
[357:54.13]What the fuck?
[357:56.05]That's so funny.
[358:05.76]There's a live birth.
[358:06.98]Yeah.
[358:07.64]This is awesome.
[358:09.06]There's four heads.
[358:10.66]Broke the board.
[358:35.89]Nice.
[358:39.05]Nice.
[358:40.43]Oh, I could just sit here and just eat potato chips and watch this for, like, the next four hours.
[358:54.36]Good commentary.
[358:55.26]Nice.
[358:57.36]With huge crunching sounds.
[359:00.14]Sick.
[359:04.10]That was pretty good.
[359:09.78]Yeah, it's blowing my mind.
[359:10.72]Me and my dad would blast through hours of these guys.
[359:19.06]I mean, this video has a million views, so it's not surprising.
[359:23.30]It's really, really cool shit.
[359:24.16]It's not surprising that people watch this stuff.
[359:32.07]Crunch joke incoming.
[359:35.55]Link this one?
[359:36.21]Yeah, here.
[359:37.57]Wait.
[359:41.48]It's an original PogChamp right there, is what that is.
[359:45.14]Oh no, this video was uploaded in 2018.
[359:46.24]Never mind.
[359:50.78]Never mind.
[359:51.32]Never mind.
[359:53.09]For some reason I thought this video was from like 2005.
[359:54.65]I don't know why.
[360:00.89]This is awesome.
[360:01.79]Here, I'll link it here.
[360:10.52]That's really cool shit.
[360:13.17]That was Matt Tomasello.
[360:17.11]Matt Tomasello.
[360:19.47]Thanks for sharing that, though.
[360:20.67]I'm probably gonna, like, watch those.
[360:23.73]Not tonight, because I'm not gonna have time tonight, but... Music.
[360:28.02]That was really good.
[360:35.26]That was Artyom.
[360:36.08]Thank you, Artyom.
[360:38.29]CatboyKubi, thanks for the 250.
[360:40.51]Jerma, I love the stream, and I'm looking forward to that shower stream you promised us.
[360:43.84]I don't remember doing that, but okay.
[360:50.57]Hey, Sins.
[360:52.35]Thank you, Sins, for the 300 bits.
[360:54.15]Hi, Jerma, thank you so much for all the kind things you said about my art during the last
[361:00.15]Community content night stream.
[361:03.01]I love to have your streams up while I work.
[361:05.33]Shout out to the lovely Discord community too.
[361:07.45]What is your favorite kind of fan art?
[361:11.79]I don't really have a favorite, but if I had to pick, if you were like, pick now, go!
[361:19.13]No, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[361:22.29]I don't want to influence any community content.
[361:26.51]Nope, nope, nope.
[361:31.23]I like it all.
[361:32.45]I think it's all good stuff.
[361:34.73]I don't want to influence anybody's work.
[361:37.53]I like to see what you come up with.
[361:39.15]There you go.
[361:42.75]But no, I... I love that shit.
[361:47.73]I'm glad that that's something to do.
[361:49.19]Because before it was... I don't want to say the words sweeping it under the rug.
[361:56.58]But images would come in, and it would be right now, the end of the stream.
[362:01.83]The stream's over.
[362:03.87]Half the audience that was here for the stream has left.
[362:07.59]And I just kind of open it and go, oh, that's pretty, that's really good stuff.
[362:10.93]Good work.
[362:12.45]And then I close it.
[362:14.16]So having a place where I can actually, that's the whole point.
[362:19.34]Everybody knows that's what's going to happen, and that's why they're all here.
[362:24.31]People are just... That's what we're doing today.
[362:26.99]It's a much better idea.
[362:28.06]It's crazy how half the viewers leave and miss so much.
[362:38.46]Yeah, but... If you have... I mean, I'm not gonna say... You have to stay at the post-stream kind of chill discussion talk session.
[362:53.29]Some people want to watch the stream.
[362:54.53]They want to see, oh, you're playing this or you're doing this and then you're done.
[362:57.30]Alright, I'm leaving.
[362:59.30]That's alright.
[363:01.12]Not for everybody.
[363:02.26]You don't have to sit here and just watch a screen like this and listen to me talk for like 30, 40 minutes while we go over messages and stuff.
[363:09.76]That's fine.
[363:11.70]More than 3,000 people still here.
[363:13.98]It's a lot of people just hanging out and just talking about nothing.
[363:17.78]Like I do a lot of times.
[363:20.26]I will just go off and just start talking about anything or nothing during these things.
[363:24.68]And then, of course, we have the people's donations and sub-messages coming too, so... It's all good.
[363:34.98]You don't have to stay.
[363:36.04]If you do, you do.
[363:37.78]And if you don't, you don't.
[363:40.84]Stream about nothing.
[363:41.78]Seinfeld.
[363:46.31]Swiggity-swanky, thanks for the 250.
[363:47.71]I know you're a big guy on Twitch and very busy because you are popular.
[363:51.71]But have you ever seen this clip of the scout?
[363:56.65]What, of Nathan doing something?
[363:58.22]Would you and Jerma stream together again?
[363:59.62]I would, absolutely.
[364:02.06]Jerma's way bigger than me, so he's way harder to get a hold of.
[364:04.24]Hey, I'm available!
[364:04.92]If you guys can convince Jerma to get a hold of me and that you want to see a stream, I am happy to do it.
[364:12.44]There you go.
[364:15.74]Think about co-op is like, gotta find like the right co-op thing to do.
[364:23.77]Hey fellas, he's available.
[364:26.01]That clip is over a year old.
[364:27.69]Oh fuck, that hurt.
[364:32.07]That clip is a year old?
[364:33.93]He didn't, wait, he didn't say this like last weekend?
[364:40.89]This clip, wait, this clip didn't happen at like four o'clock today.
[364:46.70]I'm available a year later.
[364:50.31]He's been emailing you for years.
[364:52.13]No, I mean, if something comes up to do, I just need some co-op thing to do.
[365:05.14]Look, Etalyx is right here, over there.
[365:08.08]And all the time, we're just like, do you have any co-op stuff we could do?
[365:11.58]And it's just like, no, not really.
[365:23.30]SWAT 4?
[365:23.68]Here's the thing about SWAT 4.
[365:28.05]Actually, I talked to Star today about this.
[365:30.99]Star and I have been trying to play SWAT 4 for five years.
[365:35.53]We actually talked about it today that you can actually do it now.
[365:43.15]We have been trying to play this game somehow for five years.
[365:57.07]Is there a stream that's been five years in the making?
[366:01.22]It wasn't going to be a stream.
[366:02.34]It was going to be a video.
[366:04.38]Whether Star was going to be the one making it or I was, we were going to make a video on SWAT 4.
[366:14.69]Guys, this is like 2013 or 2014.
[366:24.00]First upload on the main channel in three years.
[366:26.20]No.
[366:28.29]I can't believe it.
[366:29.80]Hey man, Jerma and Nathan!
[366:31.60]Oh yeah, hey, here's a clip!
[366:34.42]I thought this was from like a week ago or something.
[366:41.46]But co-op games are fun.
[366:44.10]But like I said before, we already went over it, but we'll go over it one more time.
[366:49.07]I just mainly do my own thing.
[366:52.83]Maybe like once every couple months.
[366:55.98]There is a multiplayer kind of co-op stream.
[366:58.77]Just kind of do my own thing.
[367:05.07]That doesn't mean I'm not going to do them.
[367:08.13]Me and Joel played Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes.
[367:12.91]Whatever happens, happens.
[367:13.97]We just keep going.
[367:14.70]Music is gone.
[367:15.68]We don't even need it right now.
[367:17.14]I'm talking to you personally right now.
[367:28.92]Just once I want the rat to get the popcorn.
[367:30.72]It's not good for rats.
[367:33.74]They're not supposed to eat it.
[367:34.42]They're supposed to eat berries and celery.
[367:37.63]Or whatever rats eat.
[367:42.19]So yeah.
[367:46.51]I will use the same streamer blanket statement.
[367:50.10]Like I said before.
[367:50.78]I love playing with people.
[367:52.82]I love streaming.
[367:55.61]For the most part, I do streams alone.
[367:58.59]Unless, of course, there's some big event going on where multiple people are going to be involved.
[368:07.10]Eat an onion?
[368:07.64]Eat an onion on stream?
[368:08.40]I don't think I can even eat a raw onion.
[368:10.76]It'd probably be bad for me.
[368:13.18]That's very edgy, dude.
[368:16.01]Just me, alone.
[368:17.07]I just do my own thing.
[368:18.59]I'm a lone loner.
[368:24.55]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[368:26.75]I love these streams where you play a game you loved when you were younger.
[368:29.11]They're very chill.
[368:30.89]Nice to watch you not suck at something.
[368:33.33]Hope you do more in the future.
[368:34.31]Have a good week.
[368:35.89]Hey, thanks.
[368:37.23]Appreciate that.
[368:42.13]Uh, Kiari, thanks for the 500 bits.
[368:44.79]A shame to see you lose right at the end, Jerma.
[368:46.58]It was a good run.
[368:48.82]Just want to thank you.
[368:49.66]You help us all out so much by making us smile.
[368:52.14]My grandfather passed away tonight.
[368:54.36]It helps having you stream around to ease pains like that.
[368:57.26]Thank you for the great stream, as always.
[368:59.75]I'm sorry for your loss.
[369:03.91]May he rest in peace.
[369:07.51]Losing a family member is always very hard.
[369:14.64]I wish you the best.
[369:17.34]Thanks for hanging out.
[369:20.96]Stick around.
[369:23.70]Stick around.
[369:26.85]Hold on, I'll tell you.
[369:28.29]What's the matter?
[369:29.71]What, you want to get out of here?
[369:31.15]You want to get out of here?
[369:33.63]Yeah.
[369:34.75]You want to get out?
[369:35.51]He wanted to come in, now he wants to get out.
[369:37.91]He's like, let me in.
[369:39.73]He's like, let me out.
[369:40.35]He's like, let me in.
[369:41.49]He's like, let me out.
[369:44.40]He must have... What, do you want to leave now?
[369:47.07]He's like, just... Alright, hold on.
[369:49.05]Hold on.
[369:49.57]One sec.
[370:18.63]He wanted to go see Kim.
[370:21.29]He heard Kim.
[370:23.25]He's like, I want to be out there.
[370:24.69]Like, you're boring.
[370:28.48]Let's go.
[370:32.02]But, uh, let's keep going.
[370:32.96]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the 500 bits.
[370:34.76]Enjoy your time off.
[370:35.60]See you Friday.
[370:36.12]See you Friday.
[370:36.46]Alright, we'll be back.
[370:43.44]We have a lot of stuff to play.
[370:47.08]I will return.
[370:48.26]You will see me next week.
[370:52.22]You died to Bail.
[370:53.46]Well, I didn't die to Bail.
[370:55.38]I died to Bail's minions.
[370:58.36]We didn't even get to see one move from Bail.
[371:00.65]But that's okay.
[371:02.23]Further than I thought I was going to get.
[371:06.12]In this whole community.
[371:06.98]Thanks for all the joy.
[371:33.97]Feeling the love from you in this community.
[371:36.29]And this community.
[371:42.43]Why would I be doing a Little Mermaid parody?
[371:49.36]Do I have just like phantoms that just go around at night and just cause mischief?
[371:56.04]Isn't there some folklore monster or creature or something that does that?
[372:00.98]What is that called?
[372:01.79]It's called something.
[372:09.43]There's these little, like, phantom goblins that mess with you and fuck with your dreams and stuff.
[372:14.36]What are they called?
[372:23.02]Your sleep paralysis demon.
[372:24.66]Well, no, I don't think... Okay, if your sleep paralysis demon is a parody of The Little Mermaid playing out in your room... Uh, that would... It would be a very strange sleep paralysis demon.
[372:41.65]I just lying back on your bed.
[372:43.32]It's not being able to move.
[372:45.14]It's just like Get me the fuck out of here He's fucked
[373:04.88]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[373:06.30]Hey, Jeremy.
[373:07.96]Hope you have fun with your friends this week.
[373:09.50]Thank you.
[373:10.80]I just want to say, the other day during community content night when you asked how I built your name in Minecraft, all I did was build up one block at a time, made a bridge up top, and just built the letters on that, then went back and removed the bridge one block at a time.
[373:25.54]It took me a while, and I wonder if there was an easier way to have done that.
[373:33.91]That's pretty pog.
[373:36.06]That's 200 IQ, yeah.
[373:40.04]Have a good night to you as well.
[373:41.52]Thank you.
[373:45.28]That's coming back probably sometime in the middle of March, I would think.
[373:49.97]We'll see.
[373:50.79]It's still being worked on.
[373:52.53]Got something special for it.
[373:54.27]That's why.
[373:54.89]It's not just gonna be what you think it is.
[373:57.89]All of one zombie thanks to the 250.
[373:59.31]I've had two dreams that you were in.
[374:02.67]The first I was your security at some red carpet event.
[374:06.57]Why does everyone dream of you?
[374:07.97]I don't know.
[374:08.67]I don't know.
[374:09.13]You're a dick.
[374:35.32]Why are you a dick in dreams?
[374:36.78]I don't know.
[374:37.54]That's not me.
[374:41.24]Quantum Jerma, yeah.
[374:42.08]Nothing like that.
[374:45.12]Keith King Crimson, thanks for the $2.50.
[374:46.90]What if that guy who kept spamming Jerma just like Backpack a few months ago could see the future?
[374:51.87]I was trying to talk about the straps of your boomer harness.
[374:56.38]I haven't said that out loud in a long time.
[374:59.60]Was that actually just somebody from this community just writing a sentence that made no sense?
[375:04.84]Or was that an actual meme that somebody... It just was, I'm going to write a nonsense statement.
[375:14.85]It means nothing.
[375:15.71]It's not a meme from anything.
[375:16.77]It's not a reference to anything.
[375:17.85]It's just somebody wrote that.
[375:20.39]That was it.
[375:21.75]From here.
[375:22.11]It was just one guy.
[375:27.67]He did it for like three streams.
[375:32.25]Hey, look at that, a wink!
[375:33.77]Could you believe it?
[375:34.82]People have been saving up!
[375:38.72]Alright, we only have a few more bits to do.
[375:51.10]He smiled at me.
[375:52.16]He smiled at me!
[375:57.70]A poop killer, thanks to the 500 bits.
[376:00.42]Freezy burns, thanks to the 300 bits.
[376:02.88]Derm, I'm gonna miss you for the next week.
[376:04.14]Always a pleasure staying up late to watch your streams.
[376:06.02]Don't forget about me.
[376:06.88]Don't worry, I won't forget about you guys.
[376:09.65]I hope you don't forget about me.
[376:11.55]When I come back, it's gonna be empty.
[376:13.05]It's gonna be an empty town here.
[376:16.21]I've been away for much longer than this.
[376:18.35]And you guys are still here, so... We'll see you when I get back.
[376:24.26]Uh, xwar2, thanks for the 250.
[376:27.85]I forgot you had to use at least 250 bits.
[376:31.94]And that is a new-ish rule over the last probably six, seven months or so, just about.
[376:37.30]Just about.
[376:37.64]Eh, maybe a little bit longer than that.
[376:40.21]But still.
[376:41.61]Still a fairly new rule in the grand scheme of things.
[376:45.11]Just want to say that I'm sad I missed all the streams this week.
[376:48.23]But this new blood has been getting caught up on VODs.
[376:52.07]It was just too many old games you had gone through.
[376:54.44]Almost caught up.
[376:55.76]Expect to see more of me in the future.
[376:58.41]This new blood's here to stay.
[377:00.49]I've only been following for two weeks.
[377:03.51]Just finished Black and White.
[377:04.55]Hopefully you'll play the sequel soon.
[377:05.95]Well, welcome.
[377:09.20]Welcome to the stream.
[377:10.38]Welcome to the channel.
[377:14.10]If you want to really catch up, totally, you've got seven and a half years of YouTube videos and streams to watch.
[377:26.28]It'll take you, I mean, it might take you maybe two or three straight months, every day, 24 hours straight to watch them all.
[377:33.69]Maybe like four months straight.
[377:34.87]You just gotta catch up.
[377:38.45]Skip season three.
[377:39.39]So I would skip season two.
[377:41.55]Season three was really good.
[377:44.70]Start with the shpee videos.
[377:50.42]This used to be a mayonnaise stream.
[377:52.06]That's an old one.
[377:53.84]No, welcome.
[377:55.12]Thanks for joining.
[377:55.76]Thanks for following.
[377:58.57]Especially thanks for giving me money.
[377:59.97]Because that's not necessary.
[378:04.33]But people do.
[378:06.03]All the fucking time.
[378:08.20]So thank you.
[378:10.72]Jbumbum7723, you gotta get it right.
[378:17.71]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[378:18.21]Somebody wrote, that's called backseat gaming.
[378:48.96]No, that game was really fun.
[378:50.46]It was very interesting, too.
[378:53.02]It wasn't that bad.
[378:54.62]I... Alright.
[378:55.90]I feel like I figured out a lot of the stuff in that game.
[378:57.94]I... I was putting... I took my time.
[379:02.12]I was trying to do stuff.
[379:03.04]I figured out the last puzzle on my own.
[379:06.56]Right?
[379:07.40]I did okay.
[379:08.80]I didn't do fantastic.
[379:09.82]I did alright.
[379:11.48]Not the worst Tony Hawk player that's ever, by the way.
[379:14.32]I'm still on that.
[379:22.45]We're gonna YouTube the end of the game.
[379:24.47]Yeah, but we don't talk about that.
[379:25.65]That was, I was just, I was cranky.
[379:27.85]I didn't have my fucking go-go applesauce.
[379:32.15]The sun joke got old.
[379:39.29]It's the new bear trap thing from Darkwood.
[379:43.61]I can't tell you it was fake because nobody will believe me anyways.
[379:46.45]It doesn't matter.
[379:49.73]I can't, like, tell you that it was real, because it was like, no, there's no way it was.
[379:52.11]Yeah, whatever.
[379:56.24]And finally, silent serenity.
[379:57.74]Thanks for the $2.50.
[380:00.60]You should upload another update video to the main channel just as a joke.
[380:04.68]No, that's just like, that's just like, that's like antagonizing somebody.
[380:10.04]I don't want to do that.
[380:18.44]Did you buy Super Frog 2?
[380:20.66]I don't even... No, I didn't.
[380:22.14]I'll have to get it.
[380:26.16]Somebody said, why does Etalyx not want to do co-op streams?
[380:28.75]No, no, that's not what I meant.
[380:30.27]I just said there's not a whole lot of co-op games to play that we really want to do.
[380:36.43]There's really only like two.
[380:39.77]SWAT's one of them.
[380:42.68]We'll probably all just play it.
[380:43.60]I think you can have up to three or four players in one of those games, can't you?
[380:47.34]Try to get all the boys together.
[380:55.92]Yeah, if you squat four, you can have like four players.
[381:02.46]The boys.
[381:02.94]Let's get the boys again.
[381:03.80]Let's get the boys back.
[381:04.70]Uh, HotDogChokeslam just gave 300 bits at the very end.
[381:14.37]Uh, they don't say it, just Dermaheart.
[381:18.83]Thank you, HotDogChokeslam.
[381:26.31]And that is it.
[381:29.01]I will see you all in a week.
[381:33.60]I've got to get going.
[381:34.82]I have to meet up with friends.
[381:38.21]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[381:39.49]Have a wonderful week.
[381:41.65]See you guys soon.
[381:42.75]Much love to you.
[381:43.39]Take care of yourselves.
[381:44.17]And good night.
