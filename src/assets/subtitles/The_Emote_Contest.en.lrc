[00:03.12]Hi there.
[00:05.96]Welcome to the stream.
[00:09.20]You know who I am.
[00:10.60]It's me!
[00:12.76]Jeremy.
[00:14.12]How are you?
[00:14.66]Good to see you.
[00:15.94]Let me make a tweet.
[00:17.16]Come on, Zach.
[00:20.96]Uh-huh.
[00:24.48]Uh-huh.
[00:26.83]Now, has he finally lost it?
[00:28.25]Oh, has he finally lost it?
[00:29.53]How come nobody... There's no lost it submission.
[00:34.59]Seriously.
[00:35.38]Just do that.
[00:39.58]twitch.tv/my name.
[00:45.88]Where I'm from.
[00:47.90]There it is.
[00:49.87]Okay.
[00:50.23]Hi, guys.
[00:51.49]It's time for us to do the showing period of the community emote contest.
[00:58.27]That's correct.
[00:59.71]Tonight's the night.
[01:01.85]The voting is going to last until next week.
[01:07.00]So, you, you got plenty of time.
[01:10.14]If you're not here right now, and you're like, oh, gosh, gosh darn it, I missed the emote cup.
[01:16.48]No, you didn't.
[01:17.75]You got a week.
[01:19.69]Just bear with me for one second.
[01:23.79]Nobody said that.
[01:24.61]What do you mean nobody said that?
[01:26.15]This is a pre, this is not a pre-recorded progress.
[01:29.45]I'm, like, look, let me, you want to prove this?
[01:33.54]Here, hold on.
[01:34.56]Look, hold on, here.
[01:38.98]Hi.
[01:40.50]It's me.
[01:41.20]You know me.
[01:42.82]Oh, look at him.
[01:44.42]He's got a tank top on.
[01:46.61]I'm doing it because it's hot out.
[01:48.05]It was like 88 degrees with a fucking 78% humidity and I'm not... I'm not... I'm not going to live that life right now.
[01:58.26]Anything behind me that's embarrassing?
[01:59.62]No.
[02:00.52]There's no animals back here, don't worry.
[02:03.52]I just, like, realized that I did this, though.
[02:05.40]I put balloons on my fingers because I haven't cut my fingernails in a long time, and I just realized it right before the stream started.
[02:12.91]And I said, people are going to give you shit for that.
[02:14.75]I'm like, well, your fingernails are disgusting, and I figured it would be an easy way to make it.
[02:17.99]They're like, yeah, you can't see them, so you can't make fun of me.
[02:20.07]So, welcome to the emote contest.
[02:24.25]Make sure there are people here before I start this.
[02:27.99]Are there people here?
[02:29.73]Are you guys here?
[02:32.07]Yeah, there's some people here.
[02:33.09]Okay.
[02:35.19]Yeah, I just don't want you to see them.
[02:36.09]But anyway, so how this is going to work is I... There's a funny story behind this one.
[02:44.42]So, trying to set up a emote contest is actually fairly difficult, because if you want to have people be able to vote more than once, but not more than 100, you gotta pay.
[02:58.37]And... This stream, ladies and gentlemen, has costed $384.
[03:04.29]From SurveyMonkey.
[03:15.14]It's the only possible solution.
[03:16.98]I had no other solution.
[03:19.38]It's 400 bucks this stream.
[03:23.22]Show emotes of that.
[03:28.39]Better.
[03:28.81]Okay, so let's see.
[03:32.07]It's not a lie.
[03:34.01]SurveyMonkey.com.
[03:35.14]It's the only place that allows you to embed the images onto each thing.
[03:39.20]I couldn't do it anywhere else.
[03:41.14]So that's the funny thing.
[03:43.81]But hold on a second.
[03:44.59]You will see how fucking awesome this is.
[03:47.03]Because every box you can tick has the emote right next to it.
[03:52.50]It's awesome.
[03:54.44]Not fucking $400 awesome.
[03:56.30]Maybe like $40 awesome.
[03:57.22]But that doesn't even matter.
[04:00.78]Look, I could just say that it was a goddamn business expense.
[04:04.83]Right?
[04:10.65]You saw my thumbnail?
[04:11.61]Let me make a thumbnail.
[04:16.62]The facecam is mirrored.
[04:17.78]Yes, it is because we're gonna be looking over here in this giant space right here is where the emotes are gonna show up.
[04:24.56]I'm gonna go one by one.
[04:26.16]There are... No, that wasn't... Oh, somebody's... Shouldn't have even fucking said a goddamn word.
[04:33.67]I shouldn't have said a fucking goddamn word.
[04:34.99]I knew that was gonna fucking happen.
[04:36.41]God damn it.
[04:38.35]I'm sorry that like that... Thank you...
[04:45.15]Thank you, Kyrotopia, for the $250.
[04:46.45]This one's on me partially.
[04:51.09]Don't.
[04:52.03]I command you.
[04:53.51]You understand?
[04:53.98]This is a direct order from your superior.
[04:56.18]Direct.
[04:56.60]If you disobey this, there's going to be big fucking trouble for you.
[05:00.94]Do not give me money to cover the costs of this fucking emote stream.
[05:07.57]Do you understand?
[05:09.20]Thank you so much for doing that.
[05:11.24]But I was making a joke about how this is the only place you can make it a real poll.
[05:16.70]And it's a $400 bill.
[05:21.04]Reverse psychology.
[05:23.14]But thank you so much, fucking Kairotobi.
[05:25.32]That's insane.
[05:26.72]Anyways, let's get those off.
[05:28.80]It's time to go.
[05:29.48]Are you guys ready for the emo contest to begin?
[05:32.10]Are you guys ready?
[05:32.60]I don't think you guys are ready.
[05:34.50]Are you ready for the first submission?
[05:36.87]I don't think they are.
[05:38.27]There's a possibility that they might not be ready for the first submission in the emote contest.
[05:41.09]Here it comes!
[05:51.22]There's the first one.
[05:55.35]Here's your first submission.
[05:58.99]This is Jerma Clown.
[06:02.06]Submission number one.
[06:02.96]I'll wait for you to get a good look.
[06:04.42]There are 36 of these, by the way.
[06:06.12]We got a lot to go through.
[06:07.01]Remember, don't think about which one is your favorite yet, because there is... There is... There's tres o cinco.
[06:26.34]More.
[06:27.12]No, what would it be for Spanish?
[06:29.92]This is 36.
[06:30.74]So there's Jerma Clown.
[06:32.73]I like it.
[06:35.15]I like how it's like a little bit mosaic.
[06:37.79]It's got that mosaic.
[06:39.39]Let's zoom in on it.
[06:40.29]Why don't we?
[06:40.71]I got the capabilities to do that.
[06:42.69]Let's get in there, right?
[06:44.17]It almost looks like a painting.
[06:48.10]First is the best.
[06:48.82]Don't say that.
[06:50.98]I do like this one, though.
[06:53.04]We can enhance.
[06:54.56]We can shrink it.
[06:56.44]There you go.
[06:56.86]That's Jerma Clon.
[06:58.40]By the way, you'll be able to see all these on the actual poll.
[07:00.88]Now that you got a good look at that one, we can see the nice look at this one.
[07:04.26]This is how it's going to go.
[07:05.00]Let's do it again.
[07:07.49]Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for the next one?
[07:15.93]I scared myself.
[07:17.57]This one is called... What is this one?
[07:20.31]What the fuck is this one called?
[07:21.23]Jerma LLL.
[07:24.61]Jerma LLL.
[07:28.89]I don't understand this one.
[07:31.75]When we went through the first pass, we were trying to figure out what the fuck this one even was.
[07:36.61]I think it's just like, is it supposed to be the Joker?
[07:40.77]Laughing loudly.
[07:43.79]Okay.
[07:44.81]Well, I could see somebody spamming that during a funny moment.
[07:49.66]Yeah, when we first, it looks like a mustache.
[07:53.12]Or like somebody just took their thumb and squeezed my mouth and squashed everything.
[07:59.34]It's 777 upside down.
[08:00.98]I mean, I guess, but... There it is.
[08:04.96]LLL.
[08:05.68]And by the way, there were a lot of submissions.
[08:08.20]There were probably... Final count, maybe 600 to 700 submissions.
[08:11.42]And 1,000 of which were not usable.
[08:13.68]So we had to go from 1,600 submissions down to 600.
[08:16.08]And then down to 36.
[08:16.52]Or 4,000.
[08:16.60]So...
[08:29.81]Fucking, that's real.
[08:31.15]Anyways, LLL, here it is.
[08:32.77]Let's do the next one.
[08:33.51]Here it comes.
[08:42.20]Hey, this Jerma Meme Cat, or Sad Cat.
[08:48.98]This one is from the, I did the bottom text, top text joke.
[08:56.14]Let's get a closer look.
[08:57.78]Meme Cat.
[08:59.69]By the way, some people submitted these with different names, but I named them other things.
[09:07.47]It's called Meme Cat.
[09:10.77]This one is your absolute favorite.
[09:12.81]Good.
[09:14.56]Oh, no, it's time for a pop quiz.
[09:18.54]There you go.
[09:18.92]Let's get a little closer so you can like the detail here.
[09:23.84]I mean...
[09:26.41]It is one of those like screen grab emotes, but I think it's okay.
[09:32.79]No, I'm not supposed to say anything.
[09:35.71]I'm not going to say anything because I don't want to give you guys any bias as to like what I think is a good one or a bad one.
[09:40.40]So I got to shut up.
[09:42.66]I got to stop talking.
[09:44.02]So here you go.
[09:44.60]Let's go.
[09:45.02]That's Jerma meme cat.
[09:46.90]You got five choices.
[09:48.73]That's it.
[09:49.57]Here comes the next one.
[09:56.73]This is not even the sounds that I was looking for.
[09:58.39]Here we go.
[09:58.61]This is Jerm of Venus.
[10:09.20]I need to have one of those keyboards that has different buttons on it.
[10:13.10]But here's Jerm of Venus in a variation of the Pog Chip.
[10:15.16]I got so many of these.
[10:17.46]They were probably...
[10:20.29]There's so many planet emotes and so many Venus and Neptunes.
[10:23.83]It was so hard to decipher which one I wanted to put on here.
[10:27.05]So, there's your PogChamp emote.
[10:30.93]That's, I guess you could say, it's Venus PogChamp.
[10:34.27]Let's get it a little closer so we can see.
[10:37.33]My big fear, actually, is that while we do this, there'll be a scenario where, like, I zoom in and it's... Oh, what's that?
[10:44.96]Oh, oh, he spelled out dick.
[10:48.31]I'm, like, actually pretty concerned about that, so bear with my nerves.
[10:52.28]Uh, that's Jerm- that's Jerm of Venus.
[10:54.88]Community.
[10:56.58]And, no, I'm not gonna tell you names.
[10:58.04]I'm not gonna tell you who made these, because I don't want any bios here.
[11:01.86]But something that you need to know, no mods participated, and I didn't participate.
[11:05.44]No friends, no mods.
[11:07.32]This was just... Like, this- this is somebody's fucking emote.
[11:12.78]There's no bios resetting, don't- don't worry.
[11:15.54]Did I say bios?
[11:18.90]Only one nostril.
[11:21.22]Only one nostril!
[11:24.30]Stay neutral.
[11:27.30]No, we're not gonna BIOS reset this one.
[11:28.65]There it is, jermaVenus, let's keep going.
[11:31.41]We're gonna get, this next one is my personal neutral.
[11:41.81]I ain't going to do that anymore because I can't queue it up.
[11:43.97]This is jermaGreed.
[11:47.57]jermaGreed.
[11:49.87]For when, you know, I say that this costed $400 and somebody gives $250.
[11:54.88]You can go ahead and put that one up there if it passes.
[12:01.60]There's a $25 emote.
[12:02.96]I can't change the emote that I already have, though.
[12:04.88]I just can't do that.
[12:07.40]Let's see if I can, like,
[12:10.63]Pretty good.
[12:11.23]He matched the face pretty well.
[12:13.85]He got my like broken ass nose.
[12:15.95]That's good.
[12:16.75]Looks good.
[12:21.67]Like the style.
[12:22.67]It's good.
[12:23.51]All of these are good.
[12:24.29]That's the thing, right?
[12:26.16]There were a lot of submissions that just got thrown away because they just either didn't show up on the screen.
[12:31.06]They were just irrelevant.
[12:32.34]They didn't really match anything that I remember.
[12:35.68]Cause these, I have, these have to be on the channel.
[12:39.32]So I ain't going to have a picture of me that I don't like because it's going to go on the channel, obviously.
[12:45.15]Like it's can't just, you know what I'm saying?
[12:47.33]You guys get it.
[12:49.24]So there it is.
[12:49.82]Jerma greed.
[12:50.32]Let's get to the next one here.
[13:07.24]I said I wasn't going to do it again, but this one... This is called, uh... This is called jermaMorph.
[13:15.08]I don't exactly know what's happening.
[13:16.50]It kind of just looks like I have a handlebar mustache.
[13:23.11]I don't know what this is combining with.
[13:26.27]I think this is... I think these eyes here are a clown.
[13:29.95]When I was in the clown makeup, and then it's the... Mars...
[13:35.02]I don't know.
[13:35.48]When it's really small, like here, I'll do this.
[13:37.70]Ready?
[13:39.70]This is what they're going to look like, right?
[13:41.90]So take a look at that.
[13:42.76]That's very strange looking.
[13:48.08]It does come out pretty well, though.
[13:52.34]And yeah, I guess it does kind of... Bias?
[13:54.42]No, I'm not saying bias.
[13:55.55]I'm just stating clear, factual information.
[14:00.43]I mean, you could say that it does look like Mars is...
[14:05.19]Somebody took the thumb with red paint and just went like this.
[14:09.17]But it's an emote.
[14:13.75]This is an emote on the screen right now.
[14:16.03]That's all I can say.
[14:23.57]Here comes the next one.
[14:29.54]There you go.
[14:30.14]Jerma Neptune.
[14:32.06]Tell us your opinions.
[14:32.92]I can't tell you my opinions because then that skews everything.
[14:37.98]Jerma Neptune.
[14:40.16]This one obviously is... I kind of look like Freddy Krueger right here, but that's okay.
[14:48.87]Constipated.
[14:49.65]This is just painful.
[14:57.43]I just look like I'm in severe pain.
[15:02.50]well there you go Jerma Neptune part of the planets I didn't want to include that many planets though a lot of planets came in but at the end of the day right if you I was gonna have a separate vote for the planets because oh here's like five neptunes and five venuses and six other solar system themed enemies
[15:25.17]I couldn't.
[15:25.87]I just didn't want to do that.
[15:26.79]Because then that separates another vote.
[15:28.61]And then they only had five or six choices.
[15:31.38]And then it skews the whole contest.
[15:33.66]Five or six enemies.
[15:36.42]Yeah.
[15:38.50]You think the planets are nice?
[15:39.66]You think the planets are good things?
[15:45.34]You guys need to read a little more, I think.
[15:49.34]Boss.
[15:50.64]There you go.
[15:51.04]Jerma Neptune.
[15:52.84]Get one more good close look at it.
[15:59.61]Looks alright.
[16:01.11]Looks pretty neutral to me.
[16:04.29]Hey, what other sound effects do we have?
[16:05.79]How about this one?
[16:09.67]Next on the list.
[16:13.73]I gotta time this correctly.
[16:16.22]It's Dermot Dwarf.
[16:18.38]Dwarf Star.
[16:22.98]Dermot Dwarf.
[16:25.08]Let's go ahead and get a little...
[16:28.33]The music actually works with this one.
[16:29.61]Let's get in there a little bit tighter.
[16:32.95]Come on, Windows.
[16:34.97]Yeah.
[16:41.05]Now, of course, I was going to rename this one for the obvious reasons.
[16:46.02]I'm sure you can find out a few because we don't want an egg situation, right?
[16:50.92]People just click because it says...
[16:57.40]Right, that word.
[16:59.06]I'm not going to say it out loud.
[17:01.60]But you understand the word that I'm referring to.
[17:06.50]But that is Jerma Dwarf.
[17:09.54]Jerma Dwarf Star.
[17:11.39]Supernova, whatever you want to call it.
[17:16.09]The way that the face... The strange thing about this one is it actually does look like a real picture.
[17:24.83]This looks like I just had a costume on.
[17:29.41]I got like blue lipstick and stuff.
[17:30.95]This one is pretty well lit.
[17:34.17]I can't say anything about them.
[17:35.93]I can't tell you anything about them.
[17:37.85]If I tell you the things I like about this, you're going to be like, oh, that's the one we're going to pick.
[17:41.41]If I tell you something bad about this, you're going to be like, oh, I don't know about that one.
[17:46.47]This one's well lit.
[17:47.51]There you go.
[17:47.89]This is a well lit emote.
[17:50.41]Bring on the next one.
[17:57.78]Ow.
[17:58.10]Jerm of facepalm.
[18:00.24]Dermaface Palm, this is just like the other one that's on there already.
[18:04.88]Dermafail, Dermaface Palm... It's... very... this one is... very well lit, as you can see.
[18:15.31]Let's get in there.
[18:16.55]The contrast is there.
[18:18.47]The levels are there.
[18:19.55]That's a fail, baby, that's a fail!
[18:28.16]Small hand!
[18:32.13]I don't have a small hand.
[18:33.17]I actually have kind of big hands.
[18:42.05]And plus, my hands are cupped over like this, and it's inside of a long sleeve, so you can't see anything.
[18:49.93]It's just that the hands are not the issue here.
[18:52.42]It's do you like this emote or not?
[18:54.30]I don't.
[18:55.52]No, no, no.
[18:56.94]I don't have an answer for you.
[18:59.56]I can't tell you if I like this one enough.
[19:03.89]Hey, what about this one?
[19:07.37]jermaTV!
[19:11.23]jermaTV.
[19:13.68]This is when the TV fell down on me.
[19:18.94]I don't know what scenario you could use this in.
[19:23.61]Maybe if I fall down in real life.
[19:27.77]Right?
[19:28.21]I guess you could put that on there.
[19:31.49]If I bump my head, this is a TV falling on me in real life, though.
[19:41.36]Lighting on this one, it's pretty well lit.
[19:43.98]You can see the light bouncing off the TV here onto my two sneakers.
[19:51.03]Actually, now that I look at this again, this sort of reminds me of
[19:56.12]This almost is like the TV is the is the object here.
[20:00.51]Not me.
[20:01.43]This looks like just a TV sitting here watching TV.
[20:06.44]Like it would have been actually this would have been a I can I can be biased on this because there's a TV right here.
[20:12.83]And there was eyes on the TV, watching the TV, and you had like, you had like, you know what I'm talking about when I say you had no eyes?
[20:19.64]Like the lasers that like say, look, I'm looking at this.
[20:22.94]Like that would have been, I would have fucking put it in.
[20:25.70]But I can't tell you what I think about this one.
[20:33.37]Fucking what?
[20:34.91]You understand what I'm saying?
[20:39.40]next we'll go hey easy easy we've got we got fainty sink all left should I do any more sound effects this is again this is makeup tutorial intro why does it keep doing the rewind sound anyways this is jermaIQ
[21:09.99]But when I do incredibly intelligent things and I say things that are just absolutely fucking phenomenally incorrect or phenomenally correct, you would use this.
[21:21.44]Wow, that was actually pretty amazing what he just said.
[21:23.17]He just made an analogy that I can absolutely relate to.
[21:27.17]Or I solve a puzzle in less than 15 seconds.
[21:32.47]Those could be there.
[21:34.28]jermaIQ.
[21:39.24]Shows up pretty well.
[21:40.10]We can use this instead of the question marks.
[21:46.48]All these are so good.
[21:48.37]I know.
[21:48.99]That's why it's been so hard.
[21:51.67]I really thought this was going to be easy.
[21:54.07]It wasn't.
[21:54.43]The last second, a bunch of these had to get removed.
[21:57.78]At least seven or eight had to be taken out.
[22:02.20]I wish I could use them all.
[22:03.58]But I only have, obviously, a certain amount of slots.
[22:06.96]Let's turn my IQ.
[22:11.78]Let's look at it small just so you can see it.
[22:15.27]Still comes up pretty well.
[22:20.01]You know Edward Nygma from Batman Begins?
[22:27.16]No, from Batman Forever when he had the thing on his head, the helmet.
[22:32.60]And Jim Carrey was sitting in like the brain drain machine.
[22:38.60]That's not bias.
[22:39.42]That's me explaining what this looks like.
[22:46.39]The Riddler, that's the Riddler.
[22:47.81]That's the Riddler's name.
[22:51.11]Compares himself to Jim Carrey.
[22:52.73]No, I'm saying that this looks like that.
[22:54.73]You know what?
[22:55.19]Let's just go ahead and go.
[23:02.71]Jermacrumble.
[23:04.71]There's Jermacrumble.
[23:07.97]Where something horrible is happening.
[23:10.40]I have meltdowns sometimes.
[23:13.16]The person decided to make a funny picture about it, obviously.
[23:25.05]they're really good yeah but you get to pick five right so you'll have a choice you can pick one or you can pick five it's up to you but you have to pick at least one chairman is mad part cookie yeah pretty well lit this color in this one
[23:51.39]There's red, there's orange, there's brown, and there's some shades in between.
[24:00.25]Alright.
[24:00.73]That's what I have to say about that one.
[24:03.01]They're all great.
[24:05.35]Here comes the next one.
[24:07.98]Somebody's loading it and somebody's hacking it.
[24:10.44]This Jerma berry.
[24:12.36]Jerma berry.
[24:12.90]Jerma raspberry.
[24:14.76]Jerma eat the berries.
[24:15.76]Jerma berry.
[24:20.75]Cartoony.
[24:21.41]This is one of the first cartoon inspired with a J. That's a strawberry.
[24:31.01]It's a berry.
[24:31.49]This is when I make a dumb voice.
[24:38.82]Hey, it's not up to me how you want to use the potential emotes.
[24:42.56]It's up to you how you would like to correlate them, right?
[24:46.11]Let's look at a small.
[24:46.89]Look at a big.
[24:47.31]There.
[24:51.01]As you can see, get in there.
[24:52.07]Get in there.
[24:52.55]Look, get in there.
[24:53.67]Get in close to your screen so you can see that.
[24:57.65]And here comes a little bit bigger.
[25:00.73]We'll zoom in just so you can see the detail.
[25:02.63]For some of you real sticklers, you know, I'm going to see the line work.
[25:07.53]I got you covered already.
[25:08.43]Take a look at that.
[25:11.69]There you go.
[25:12.01]Jermaberry.
[25:14.99]How long has the stream been?
[25:15.99]Oh, we're not even close.
[25:17.79]How many more do we have? 200.
[25:20.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[25:21.89]This is not that many.
[25:24.49]Let's put on some background music.
[25:25.71]What do you say?
[25:27.46]Fun background music.
[25:30.72]I don't listen to fucking songs.
[25:33.74]Background music.
[25:35.10]Happy and fun background music.
[25:36.70]Upbeat.
[25:37.78]Acoustic fun background music.
[25:52.63]No, this is a tutorial.
[25:53.39]You can't, you can't... By the way, guys, in case you're wondering, don't ever search for background music.
[25:57.63]Don't ever try to find music that's not licensed music.
[26:01.07]Otherwise, you end up in a makeup video.
[26:06.10]Or a very fast times 10 speed building something simple.
[26:12.20]How to make the Enterprise out of toothpicks!
[26:14.00]And it's just like...
[26:19.93]And then like the video's producer, it's like some fucking company that makes these like nine second videos.
[26:25.44]Their weird logo just appears right fucking here in front of you.
[26:31.84]Every Facebook video you'll ever watch.
[26:35.48]The elevator music, let's try that.
[26:37.12]Now this is the illegal one.
[26:45.33]I gotta go, next one, next!
[26:48.53]Jerma 95.
[26:50.47]Jerma windows 95 this one for the all the old video games I know I might be confusing you with the other mouse on here but let me make this a little bit more clear Jerma windows 95 let's take a look at the small I gotta do this for all of them that's like the icon you click on
[27:16.95]very Very well lit if you know if you understand what I'm saying really this one's really well lit I Need a different elevator music There that that's better Let's do this sucks just enough to be alright in the background Alright, so that's Jerma 95
[27:47.93]Take a look.
[27:50.45]See it.
[27:51.71]Smell it.
[27:54.38]Did this destroy all humans?
[27:55.50]Elevate?
[27:55.74]I can't do that.
[27:56.52]Somebody told me I was going to get arrested if I played that again.
[27:58.88]I can't do that.
[28:03.10]Turn it up.
[28:05.76]Alright.
[28:06.00]Well, here you go.
[28:06.44]Jerma 95.
[28:07.50]If you like it, please vote for it.
[28:10.22]And why don't we get the next one here?
[28:13.04]Jerma Titan.
[28:15.32]Part of the emote planets.
[28:16.67]Another one.
[28:19.14]Or a variant of the PogChamp emote, as we've all seen before.
[28:23.52]How do you vote?
[28:24.02]We're not there yet.
[28:24.84]We're not there yet.
[28:25.48]We're going to get to just... Don't worry.
[28:27.52]You will be able... It's not going to be confusing.
[28:30.05]All these emotes that you've seen so far, they will be on a giant list on a survey that you'll be able to look at all of them again.
[28:37.77]Trust me, it's going to be fun.
[28:39.71]It's $400 for that.
[28:41.87]But hey, here's a... Let's zoom this in.
[28:45.73]There you go.
[28:46.29]Dermatitan.
[28:47.97]Another champ kind of emote, right?
[28:49.97]Bog champ.
[28:51.61]It's a marble.
[28:54.36]I mean, it could be.
[28:56.72]Pretty well lit.
[28:57.28]Let's shrink it down.
[29:03.44]Remember, a lot of the... This is annoying me.
[29:10.25]The thing about these emotes, though, are...
[29:13.50]a lot of the criteria was it has to look good small, right?
[29:17.90]So that's how it looks small and it has to come out small.
[29:20.73]You have to understand like how it looks and you have to be able to see at least a gist of what it is.
[29:25.53]Some of these drawings that people made were amazing, but when they shrunk down, you just couldn't, it was just not enough to tell.
[29:33.13]So there was a very specific criteria.
[29:37.27]Let's zoom in a little.
[29:40.85]Masters in emote science.
[29:44.73]Sometimes.
[29:45.79]Alright, put that fucking music back on.
[29:49.41]Alright, let's keep going.
[29:51.15]Let's just... We're not gonna do any funny noises anymore.
[29:53.36]We're just gonna go.
[29:59.04]This is Jerma Donkey.
[30:03.34]Jerma Donkey.
[30:04.04]In its glory.
[30:06.40]There you go.
[30:11.47]An animal and it seems to be some type of eating apparatus coming out of the horse Potentially one would say it might be inside of the horse Maybe something like that Maybe a little reading between lines that this artist decided to do
[30:36.09]This one is well something, you know?
[30:39.27]It's got a well something in it.
[30:42.11]I like the music has calmed down a little.
[30:44.51]Now it's just a little slower.
[30:45.99]I like it.
[30:46.27]There you go.
[30:48.52]That's Jerma Donkey.
[30:54.82]Hope you like it.
[30:57.14]Let's get the next one here.
[30:58.02]Jerma Donkey.
[31:02.00]This is Jerma Golem.
[31:04.80]Jerma Golem.
[31:07.97]Take a look at the small... You can say... You can use it however you want, but that... This was actually a Venus submission.
[31:21.08]But it looked a lot like a rock monster.
[31:24.58]So, Jerma Golem.
[31:28.98]Actually, let's keep it small for a minute so you can see what it looks like small.
[31:32.64]Let's reach over and pull it out a little.
[31:36.57]You see a pancake, it's up for interpretation.
[31:39.13]Artists, you know, artist's work is always taken for interpretation, so.
[31:47.80]Oh, it looks like a potato chip.
[31:49.28]Or a cookie.
[31:51.88]It's clobbering time.
[31:53.48]Terrible thing.
[31:56.19]Welcome to Venus, that's right.
[31:59.31]There it is.
[32:01.15]Hope you enjoy it.
[32:04.31]Or it does look like Thanos sunburned.
[32:06.85]No, I can't.
[32:07.55]I can't.
[32:08.11]We're not doing that.
[32:09.07]Because now I'm giving you fucking funny emote ideas.
[32:14.72]I don't know.
[32:15.30]Alright.
[32:16.16]That Jerma... Jerma Golem.
[32:19.47]No, Jerma Golem.
[32:20.91]I got to pronounce it right.
[32:23.19]This is Jerma Nosewipe.
[32:26.42]I was wiping my nose.
[32:27.98]Like this, as you can tell.
[32:28.88]I don't know why somebody screen capped that.
[32:32.37]But I might have had some mucus issue up there in the cavity.
[32:39.02]Jerma nose wipe.
[32:41.46]If you want to see it from down there.
[32:44.14]That's what it would look like if you were to... I would assume this would be used during a bout of sneezing.
[32:50.93]Or if I had some type of cold during the week.
[32:54.99]Oh, Jerva's got a cold!
[32:56.87]He's sneezing, right?
[32:58.91]That would be the perfect place for this.
[33:00.63]Not that well lit, though.
[33:02.21]I don't see... The lighting on this one, not too well lit to me.
[33:11.67]That's Jerma Nose Wipe.
[33:16.59]We don't have to spend any more time on that one.
[33:21.16]This is Jerma Cosmos.
[33:23.48]Jerma Cosmos.
[33:25.84]Fulfilling the, obviously, the more interplanetary galactical themes.
[33:34.11]This is Cosmos.
[33:36.64]This one's very light.
[33:38.08]Very well lit.
[33:39.44]Let's get it a little bit bigger so you can take a better look at it maybe.
[33:43.90]There you go.
[33:46.64]Just put them all in.
[33:47.64]I don't have that many emote slots.
[33:50.80]You make it sound like I have 40 emote slots.
[33:53.70]We'd have to delete everything and reupload all these.
[33:55.98]No, this is a contest.
[33:59.10]You gotta pick the best ones.
[34:05.76]Uh, but yeah, Jerma Cosmodes.
[34:09.13]Kind of, yes.
[34:10.31]I mean, I guess it's kind of... I can't say that.
[34:15.09]Yes, I can.
[34:15.57]That's fucking funny.
[34:16.79]It looks like a Sour Patch Kid.
[34:24.94]It really... It does look like a blue raspberry Sour Patch Kid.
[34:34.64]Everything's gotta be blue!
[34:36.12]Did I skip one?
[34:41.23]No.
[34:42.79]This is Jerma Demon Lord.
[34:45.75]Jerma Demon Lord.
[34:48.75]Zaraxos.
[34:52.71]Pretty nice Zaraxos lighting on here.
[34:56.21]Forehead, well lit.
[34:58.17]Horns are lit up.
[34:59.51]Pretty well lit.
[35:01.52]So...
[35:02.80]Let's get a closer look at this.
[35:04.12]Shut the fuck up.
[35:06.30]Is that going to burn?
[35:09.76]Did I get sunburn?
[35:13.00]I get maybe a little.
[35:15.52]So this is Demon Lord.
[35:16.64]Let's get a closer look.
[35:19.42]I really like the line work around the lighting.
[35:24.86]The mouth is very deep, turning into his rack so slowly.
[35:34.55]says dick on his no it doesn't don't say that you know what I'm saying look I'm just waiting over here right like on his left eye it says dick right there I'm surprised nobody did that and submissions are closed so you can't even think about trying that let's look at it small we're gonna go over all of them one more time we're gonna do them all really small
[36:04.09]There you go.
[36:06.27]He's bald, just like me.
[36:08.86]Oh, is he?
[36:12.82]Jerma demon lord.
[36:15.48]Looks like he's sticking out his tongue.
[36:17.50]He could be.
[36:18.82]Get that music back on.
[36:22.36]Jerma future.
[36:24.30]Why am I going to be red?
[36:25.56]Oh, I guess I am.
[36:27.04]I'm going to be in the...
[36:29.82]Shut the fuck up.
[36:31.08]I'm going to be in Nevada.
[36:33.36]So out in Nevada, like I actually might get a really bad burn because it's really sunny there every day.
[36:39.55]I'm not going to grow horns though.
[36:41.83]Why would I do that?
[36:46.83]He's from hell just like you.
[36:48.24]Alright, let's keep going.
[36:49.22]Get that music back on here, please.
[36:55.04]And here comes the next one.
[37:00.73]Jerma Orson.
[37:02.53]Jerma Orson for Orson Welles.
[37:06.53]One of our favorite actor people.
[37:14.00]The French Champagne.
[37:14.98]He's obviously kind of drunk.
[37:18.28]There it is.
[37:18.70]Small.
[37:24.82]This is a load of shit.
[37:26.56]Plenty of wonderful quotes from Orson.
[37:32.76]Let's look at it a little bigger.
[37:35.42]You can get a closer look just in case you're not sure.
[37:39.42]How many times can you vote?
[37:42.05]You can vote for each one.
[37:43.19]No, you can't... Shh!
[37:51.03]When I start giving rules, you stop playing.
[37:54.67]When I start talking, you lower your volume.
[37:56.74]So...
[38:03.40]the rules are let's talk about them alexa you can vote five times but you can't vote for the same thing five times you have to pick your five favorites no more than five if you vote more than five you're gonna get like an error it's a big red error is gonna show up it's gonna say you fucked up then it's gonna send you back so you have to pick at least one and you can't pick more than five
[38:33.97]And you have to pick at least one, and you can't pick more than five.
[38:41.57]Fucking idiots.
[38:44.39]Let's do the next one.
[38:45.09]Jerma Orson.
[39:01.60]I'm thinking about something really funny that happened the other day.
[39:03.80]Like, I saw a guy, like, fall and, like, trip, and he, like, bumped his knee, and he was an old guy.
[39:09.03]That's what I'm laughing at.
[39:11.47]This one has pretty good lighting on one of the parts of the face.
[39:15.33]This is Jerma Defoe.
[39:16.23]If you want to see what it looks like small, there you go.
[39:31.16]That was really funny when that happened the other day.
[39:35.43]Uh, there you go.
[39:36.41]Jerma Defoe.
[39:39.13]For, uh... What scenario would you use this in?
[39:54.72]There's no scenario where this makes any fucking sense.
[40:00.67]Why would it be there?
[40:01.85]What does this convey?
[40:02.97]Alright, let's keep going.
[40:07.49]Next one.
[40:09.05]This is jermaDisgust.
[40:12.09]One of your standard, something's happening and I'm reacting to an image.
[40:16.87]jermaDisgust.
[40:18.99]There were like two or three of these submitted, but this one was the most clear at small pixels and far away distances.
[40:31.52]There it is.
[40:31.78]You can see it's small.
[40:32.84]Make it a little bigger.
[40:33.46]Let's zoom in.
[40:35.48]Somebody said bald, but I clearly see hair here.
[40:49.35]Okay, that's less annoying.
[40:52.72]There you go.
[40:53.30]jermaDisgust.
[40:56.40]That's chocolate frosting.
[40:57.92]No, it is not.
[40:58.48]That is my hair.
[41:00.68]jermaDisgust.
[41:02.82]Zoom in to see the hair.
[41:03.68]Fine.
[41:03.92]I'm going to play this game.
[41:06.44]There it is.
[41:13.56]I mean, it does look a little strange.
[41:15.94]But then again, look at right there.
[41:17.52]You see right here?
[41:19.52]You see right here.
[41:21.92]That's what it's capturing.
[41:23.70]I have this weird fudge hair in that exact spot.
[41:27.92]So there's your proof that that's not like a wig or something.
[41:34.06]There you go, jermaDisgust.
[41:38.76]It's chocolate.
[41:40.00]You guys are fucking memeing all the time.
[41:42.82]There it is, Jerma Cliff.
[41:45.16]Jerma Cliff.
[41:48.16]For the, you know, maybe one or two opportunities where I've maybe fall down off of something.
[41:56.09]There it is, it's correct resolution.
[42:04.84]That's not a cliff.
[42:08.05]Yes, it is.
[42:10.63]That's a cliff.
[42:11.19]This is Jerma cliff.
[42:15.91]No, this is not a belt loop.
[42:17.42]These aren't pants.
[42:20.60]This is like a tree.
[42:21.94]This is me falling out of a tree.
[42:26.62]This is not like somebody's pants.
[42:32.25]Listen.
[42:34.21]Very clearly.
[42:35.02]Let's zoom in on this one again.
[42:38.30]This is an edge in Dark Souls.
[42:40.68]I remember seeing this exact edge.
[42:44.10]You had to read that message.
[42:47.44]Well, look, when it's this small, it just looks like I'm falling and reaching up.
[42:52.15]You could make the belt buckle argument.
[42:54.33]Yeah, sure.
[42:55.23]Right here, maybe, but not when it's actually in its intended size.
[42:58.55]There you go.
[43:04.10]See?
[43:05.66]I mean, it does kind of maybe look like I'm throwing up a hand out of my mouth, but that's, besides the point, as jermaCliff, it looks more, no, it does, looks pretty neutral when it's small.
[43:17.16]That's what you meant to say.
[43:19.70]Let's keep going.
[43:20.14]We still, there's a lot more.
[43:21.58]You think this is, we're not even, we just barely scratched the surface.
[43:24.99]That's not even true.
[43:25.51]There's probably like 15 more.
[43:28.73]Go.
[43:28.95]Another clown-based image.
[43:35.10]This one is... Jerma... Jerma Clown.
[43:39.78]Jerma Ha Clown.
[43:48.07]There you go.
[43:49.49]I won't tell you very much more about this one.
[43:51.59]I don't know how I feel about this one.
[43:55.62]I feel pretty hot or cold.
[43:58.48]Let's get closer.
[44:01.88]What do you do with currency?
[44:06.48]Get it in close.
[44:07.40]Pull it back.
[44:09.16]Shows up very well when it's small.
[44:16.26]Yeah, this is Hot Clown.
[44:19.07]It's a dick in his hair.
[44:23.85]Leave it there.
[44:24.21]Remember, we're going to go through them all again.
[44:25.35]We're going to go through them all.
[44:26.33]I'm going to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 on them so you can see them very quickly.
[44:43.48]No, there isn't.
[44:44.16]I don't see anything.
[44:45.72]Jerma Hot Clown!
[44:47.60]Keep going!
[44:49.15]This is Jerma Woe.
[44:52.21]Do I need to say the Jerma part?
[44:53.29]You guys know what I'm... This is Woe.
[45:04.71]No, this is hair.
[45:05.75]That's a strand of hair.
[45:08.52]Jerma Woe.
[45:10.70]This is Jerma Woe.
[45:14.90]There you go.
[45:15.44]That's what it looks like when it's small.
[45:22.34]Uh, woe or woe?
[45:24.52]W-O-A-H.
[45:25.97]W-O-A-H.
[45:27.89]Woa.
[45:28.81]Wa.
[45:34.61]See it small, see it big.
[45:38.86]Once it gets to be like this, you can't really tell what the hell this is.
[45:52.15]don't get this don't buy that product we have to stay neutral about this shit all stream don't buy that or don't don't do or don't what do I care right like what the fuck do I care if you do or do not buy that we're gonna stay neutral alright this Jerma woe sort of fulfills a potential planetary um
[46:17.49]Planetary emote.
[46:18.71]We have a couple similar ones, but it's very well lit.
[46:22.17]And it kind of, like, it's the scary image from when I was back there behind the door.
[46:28.21]Jerma, whoa.
[46:30.91]What?
[46:31.37]That was not correct.
[46:31.97]Here we go.
[46:33.67]This is Jerma pre-recorded.
[46:36.71]For that really, you know, that moment when you know that there's absolutely absolutely something on screen that you are certain I did before the stream started.
[46:50.85]Nobody said that.
[46:56.95]High quality... High quality music.
[47:01.86]Yeah, pre-recorded.
[47:02.86]Take a look at what it looks like small.
[47:07.68]High contrast.
[47:08.92]Looks good on... If you were to use... If you were to use it.
[47:14.14]Read this or this is pre-recorded.
[47:15.68]Yes.
[47:17.68]Or you can be used in a movie if there's like a movie going on.
[47:20.44]You can spam this during the film.
[47:26.46]Why am I so mad during the pre-recording?
[47:28.80]I don't know.
[47:30.42]That's true.
[47:32.62]Now that I think about that, what has got me so angry?
[47:39.41]I'm not going to lie for one second.
[47:41.23]I don't know why I thought that this image was taken now.
[47:45.43]I saw the two next to each other and I was like... No, this was like... I don't know when this was.
[47:51.81]But there you go.
[47:53.73]Pre-recorded.
[47:56.30]Looks pretty good.
[47:57.90]Or pretty bad.
[47:59.02]Depending on what you like.
[48:01.56]Next one!
[48:02.40]This is Jerma Nerve.
[48:04.44]Jerma Nervous.
[48:07.82]It's tripping.
[48:09.26]Sorry, guys.
[48:10.82]I went out back and I just picked up a bunch of grass.
[48:13.94]I just started eating it.
[48:14.94]And then I started seeing things.
[48:17.36]There you go, Jerma Nervous.
[48:22.34]Jerma Nerve, whatever.
[48:23.04]It's probably easier to do Nerve.
[48:26.67]There's your smaller view of it, for sure.
[48:32.37]Yeah, like house grass.
[48:34.80]And I mean like regular grass, not weird grass that I found in the woods.
[48:38.08]We're talking just normal house grass.
[48:41.66]Jerma Nerve.
[48:42.46]Let's pull it up.
[48:43.18]Get closer.
[48:47.35]For those times when I get nervous.
[48:54.31]Little pupils.
[48:56.39]Let's take a look.
[48:57.07]Oh, no, don't move me.
[48:58.15]Move you.
[49:01.73]Yeah, I mean, it still comes out.
[49:03.35]You can still tell.
[49:05.42]it is the silhouette still there you can still make out what it's trying to be but plus my pupils are small anyways look how do I here can I watch how small my pupils are ready like this they're like this anyways see
[49:34.93]By the way, anybody that got that joke, like, you... You get 20... Now I can't see.
[49:40.19]Next one!
[49:41.47]jermaChomp!
[49:45.70]Not gonna destroy... It's a light!
[49:46.68]It's an iPhone light!
[49:47.44]It was in my... The doctor does that to you when he checks to see when you hit your head on the snowboard.
[49:51.40]To see if you're okay.
[49:54.36]You know, he, like, puts the flashlight in his mouth and, like, sits you down and, like, pulls you close and goes... jermaChomp.
[50:04.98]A rat-themed emote.
[50:12.22]Shows up pretty well.
[50:13.82]When it's small, almost looks like a hand is in there, like a sock puppet.
[50:18.38]Why'd you hit your head on a snowboard?
[50:19.58]Because I did a fucking backflip, man!
[50:23.13]And during the third backflip in a row going off the jump, the board went like, like into my fucking mouth.
[50:35.21]Nice.
[50:40.04]Dermachomp.
[50:41.54]Let's get in there.
[50:44.24]I got a lot of Pee Wee Herman vibes from this one.
[50:49.64]No, it's three backflips, actually.
[50:52.50]Yeah, Dermachomp.
[50:53.84]C-H-O-M-P.
[50:57.46]Again, let's get one more look over here.
[50:59.36]Oh, Spider-Man!
[51:00.14]Fuck me!
[51:25.98]Did I fly up?
[51:27.30]Thank God.
[51:27.68]Get the fuck out of here, dude.
[51:30.63]It's the same one.
[51:37.39]It wasn't that small.
[51:38.46]They're big around here.
[51:39.46]They're like six meters.
[51:44.88]That's the same one.
[51:47.99]Nothing.
[51:49.31]As you saw, when he crawled by the desk, he's a loser, you know what I mean?
[51:54.53]I just think that he was a loser, that's why I did that.
[51:57.33]And I was ready to, like, that noise, you guys don't even fucking understand.
[52:01.30]You guys never did karate.
[52:02.24]You guys never did, like, taekwondo like I did.
[52:04.90]When you're about to, like, fucking smash something, like, destroy it, you gotta exert sound.
[52:10.38]What do you think, like, Link does that in every fucking game he's in?
[52:14.83]I was about to, like, just crush him.
[52:17.75]So you have to, like, get out the noise.
[52:23.61]He's just hiding under the balloon right now.
[52:25.65]You fucking little asshole.
[52:26.73]Alright.
[52:28.09]Keep going.
[52:28.47]jermaChomp.
[52:30.11]jermaHeart.
[52:32.93]jermaHeart.
[52:36.67]There it is.
[52:37.13]Let's take a look at jermaHeart.
[52:39.97]Small.
[52:42.26]Comes out very well.
[52:50.64]get a closer look another thing that uh there was not necessarily I don't want to say there's a problem but there wasn't a problem uh wait a minute we might have a little bit of an issue here what happened down here uh oh no it's fine to be clear all these are gonna people are gonna get contacted if they're uh oh there's a dick no uh if they win we're gonna get obviously
[53:16.66]clinch I like this one so like bias I said this one not good I like this one though but I like them all I like every single emote that you've seen the spider's now gone I don't know where he is because I was too conflicted jermaHeart very lovingly lovingly crafted emo thank you he's I think he's on me next one
[53:44.04]Why didn't I... I should have deleted this one.
[53:46.64]I should have fucking deleted this one.
[53:47.92]I don't know why it's even here.
[53:49.62]We were just laughing about it in the Discord.
[53:51.99]This Jerma... Jerma Bieber clown.
[53:59.03]I just came into a scenario here that I did not realize and didn't think all the way through.
[54:03.27]I'm not going to say it out loud because obviously that would cause a problem.
[54:09.97]But there's a scenario here that I don't like.
[54:12.55]That makes potentially... I don't... This scenario is like a bunch of clowns.
[54:25.44]And pick your favorite clown.
[54:29.62]Because there's like three of five emote slots.
[54:33.72]There's another spider right there.
[54:45.85]Why are they doing this to me?
[54:49.61]Pick your favorite clown.
[54:50.85]I'll know because I can get all that.
[54:53.26]I can see all the data.
[54:54.16]Alright, let's keep going.
[55:02.22]Jerma clown.
[55:02.66]Wait, we didn't even look at it small.
[55:08.95]There you go.
[55:09.27]There it is small.
[55:10.09]Big nose.
[55:17.29]I can't even say anything, man.
[55:22.47]I fucking hate this.
[55:25.77]This is pure torture.
[55:26.93]Alright, there you go.
[55:27.39]Look at it big again.
[55:28.31]Next one.
[55:28.73]Dermabieberclown.
[55:30.14]There it is.
[55:31.34]Dermagull.
[55:32.18]Dermaseagull.
[55:33.30]Dermagull.
[55:42.17]Well drawn.
[55:45.36]Although, do gulls have this here?
[55:48.20]I remember a seagull having a, like a toucan Sam mouth.
[55:51.26]Like that's a toucan mouth, right?
[55:54.36]That doesn't, no, I mean, it's, that does not mean it's bad.
[55:57.56]That means that it is there.
[56:00.33]It's currently there, right?
[56:08.45]He fell, he fell, where is he?
[56:20.17]And stay down there!
[56:26.71]Fucking wuss.
[56:29.46]Won't ever come over my fucking desk again.
[56:41.33]I don't need headphones anymore.
[56:45.83]The Jerma gull, the Jerma seagull, there it is.
[56:47.85]Let's take a look at it small.
[56:50.58]I fucking, such a fucking baby.
[56:55.26]Get a grip.
[56:56.98]I don't want to run him over with my chair car though.
[56:59.00]I don't want to run his head over because I'll hear the noise.
[57:01.40]I'll hear the noise in my sleep.
[57:07.06]Okay, no, that's just water.
[57:08.86]That's just water.
[57:12.44]I thought this was spiders all over the screen.
[57:16.23]Look at this.
[57:16.87]Can I show you this?
[57:19.63]You tell me that this is not spiders all over the screen.
[57:22.85]You understand?
[57:24.65]Check this out.
[57:27.54]Those are spiders all crawling down my screen.
[57:30.98]It was full screen over there.
[57:39.91]I gotta get over this shit, seriously.
[57:42.27]They're like as big as baseballs in Nevada.
[57:50.49]jermaGull.
[57:51.03]There it is.
[57:52.25]There it is.
[57:54.05]Next one.
[57:55.25]jermaPain.
[57:55.89]I have to eat one to overcome my fear.
[58:03.50]jermaPain.
[58:04.24]In case your life is currently giving you problems and causing pain.
[58:13.24]There it is.
[58:13.78]Life is great.
[58:17.87]I need to examine every inch of this room.
[58:21.53]But if he fell and he made the noise, that like... No, it can't be fully balled.
[58:29.17]This is a screen grab from the game.
[58:32.25]This voting is going to be hard.
[58:33.29]That's by design.
[58:34.31]It's supposed to be that way.
[58:38.79]I hope it's very hard for you because that means that there's a lot of good ones.
[58:44.46]There you go.
[58:44.84]Take a look at it small.
[58:47.98]still I mean it's a little little on the exposed side but you can still tell what's going on there I like it if I were in the audience and I decided that this was the one that I wanted jermaPain Jerma frog Jerma frog
[59:14.12]With the colors of the channel.
[59:16.23]That kind of teal and pink look.
[59:20.71]Aqua.
[59:24.75]Our own version, potentially, of that frog emote.
[59:28.53]Small.
[59:28.93]It comes out very well.
[59:33.04]It's a tarantula inside of your mouth.
[59:38.00]Need more frogs.
[59:42.12]I mean, I... Yeah.
[59:45.37]Looks good.
[59:46.13]Let's get closer.
[59:49.36]And again, I am not going to tell you who made these until the person wins.
[59:54.62]Because, I don't know, I don't want it to be one of those scenarios where you hear a name and you're like, oh, I've seen that guy in chat.
[59:59.30]That guy told me I was a fucking idiot.
[60:01.36]I'm not voting for his stupid emote.
[60:02.79]I'm not going to have one of those scenarios.
[60:08.73]It was me.
[60:09.01]Termifrog.
[60:10.69]Termifrog.
[60:15.17]I have to press the button.
[60:15.91]It doesn't just do that.
[60:16.61]And now I'm, like, sweating.
[60:17.49]Hey, I know that guy.
[60:22.71]This was Jerma... I couldn't come up with a good name for this one.
[60:25.43]This is Blush.
[60:26.83]This is Jerma R. Blush for Rat.
[60:28.65]This is Rat Blush.
[60:31.57]Another one of those cute... cute emotes.
[60:37.35]It's a Rat Blushing.
[60:38.57]Although, I could... No, that's gonna add...
[60:44.29]If I have a bunch of rat emotes.
[60:46.57]And they're like kind of supposed to be me.
[60:49.11]Wouldn't this be turned into my.
[60:52.35]Like that's me.
[60:54.21]But it's not me.
[60:54.97]That's the rat.
[60:55.71]I have nothing to do with that.
[60:57.46]I am not.
[60:58.06]This is not me.
[60:59.32]You know what I mean?
[61:02.60]This is the rats.
[61:04.96]I thought I told you to not play ads.
[61:09.00]I need to.
[61:15.46]Okay, I can get my headphones back.
[61:16.56]Alright, since that spider episode happened, there's like water under my armpits.
[61:24.45]Look at that.
[61:31.35]Swear to God.
[61:35.14]Satan could rip a hole...
[61:38.41]Over here.
[61:39.67]Outside my fucking window.
[61:41.73]And tear out and be 30 fucking feet tall.
[61:46.46]And he would just stand there and be like, all tremble below you fucking heathens.
[61:52.74]And he'd have a big spear in his hand and he would look right in the eye.
[61:55.90]Me and I wouldn't even care.
[61:57.68]I'd be like, oh shit, what the fuck is that?
[62:00.48]It's like, whoa, man, that's kind of weird.
[62:03.67]You put a spider as big as a thumbtack on my desk and I'm going to die.
[62:14.02]There could be a tornado that goes across here.
[62:15.94]And I would be like, oh, tornado?
[62:17.76]Hold on, what'd they say?
[62:19.64]What'd they say?
[62:20.16]Oh, wow, like 60,000 homes?
[62:24.20]And it's coming from mine next.
[62:26.45]Whoa, really?
[62:27.75]Fucking whoa.
[62:28.77]Alright, I'll talk to you later, dude.
[62:31.91]Oh, yeah, a spider is on my desk.
[62:33.55]Ugh!

[63:14.30]Get the big version of Fireman.
[63:17.68]He made the first cut.
[63:19.30]This is the second or third cut here.
[63:23.14]He looks pretty cute.
[63:24.22]Looks like a good dude.
[63:26.22]Pretty cool, if you ask me.
[63:27.88]I like it.
[63:31.40]The contest is over.
[63:32.64]The contest hasn't even started yet.
[63:34.55]The contest just started.
[63:38.43]Alright.
[63:39.55]So there's Fireman.
[63:41.55]That's the end.
[63:43.57]That's it.
[63:45.56]There are 36 choices.
[63:46.86]We went through all of them.
[63:48.02]Now let's go through them one more time.
[63:50.92]And let's just... Let's see which one you think that you'd like to use.
[63:56.32]Okay, so let's go through them.

[65:24.21]See?
[65:24.71]I'm going to put them right in the middle.
[65:26.28]And I'm going to turn everything else off so I can't give you any bias.

[68:49.83]And this is going to run until next week.
[68:53.82]So you'll have an opportunity to... I'm gonna... We're gonna make a hashtag... Not a hashtag, a... Exclamation point.
[69:00.10]Emote.
[69:01.02]Or emotes.
[69:02.20]So over the next week... Because obviously there are a lot of people here now.
[69:06.66]But for the people that aren't here right now, then obviously I want to give an opportunity for people to vote.
[69:12.18]So... Wait, you did that on one stream for like an hour and ten minutes?
[69:16.46]Okay.
[69:17.02]Well, I didn't get to vote.

[69:49.32]Those of you that are going to try to do it more than once, you can't.
[69:52.68]Only one time.
[69:54.96]But I'm interested to see, just in this initial push here, what you guys think.
[70:05.42]Use multiple devices?

[70:10.76]What, are you going to borrow Dad's iPhone?
[70:16.06]You're going to borrow dad's iPhone.
[70:17.54]Is that what you're going to tell me that you're going to do?
[70:27.05]I collect all the data.
[70:27.91]I know exactly who you are.

[72:01.24]Oh, nevermind.
[72:02.96]I told you this before, but the five people that win, you're gonna get to choose if you want a Amazon gift card or a Steam gift card code.
[72:11.50]That's going to be worth $50 for each one.
[72:13.74]So there's five $50 prizes.
[72:17.58]You get a Steam card or you get an Amazon card.
[72:22.62]And by this point next week, there'll be enough votes.
[72:26.47]And we'll check in on... You better believe it.

[72:38.11]And you don't get $50.
[72:38.53]You get...
[72:41.16]an Amazon gift card code worth a total of potential $50 USD value.
[72:47.91]I'm not giving you $50.
[72:50.73]I'm giving you a redeemable series of digits which you can put into your account on Amazon to then be able to redeem United States dollars worth of Amazon money.
[73:05.54]Only if you win.

[75:16.27]I need to go deal with it.
[75:19.61]Someone's coming over tomorrow morning very early to cut out the ceiling.
[75:23.89]And I have to go get supplies for that.
[75:28.80]There's somebody coming over tomorrow morning to cut out the ceiling.
[75:34.81]I'm not going to stream that.
[75:36.59]I'll take a couple of pictures if you want.
[75:38.13]I'm not going to stream that.
[75:39.07]That's boring.
[75:41.57]He stuttered.
[75:42.11]He's lying.
[75:48.85]Siri, am I lying about my appointment tomorrow for somebody to come cut out my ceiling?
[75:56.12]I didn't find any appointments about come cut out my ceiling.
[76:04.03]No, we'll do something for like an hour or two.
[76:05.77]I'll be right back.
[76:06.19]I'm going to pee.
[76:08.03]I'll be right back.
[76:08.55]I got to come up with another excuse.
[76:09.81]I'll be right back.
[76:10.43]I got to think of something more dramatic than that.
[76:12.25]I'll be back in five minutes.
[76:38.47]Oh, by the way, if you're leaving, if you're just taking off now, thanks for sticking around.
[76:43.05]Thanks for coming to vote.
