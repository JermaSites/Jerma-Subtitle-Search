[00:04.53]How's everybody doing?
[00:06.85]How are you?
[00:07.35]Have you been?
[00:07.75]You've been good?
[00:10.23]Doing alright?
[00:11.19]Oh, thanks.
[00:11.71]Things going alright?
[00:16.43]I'm late.
[00:16.83]Well, I'm not really.
[00:17.47]I'm not really.
[00:18.39]I'm early.
[00:20.25]Started to 40 minutes early.
[00:35.50]Is that you?
[00:36.16]Is that you from Fortnite?
[00:38.33]Yeah, that's me from Fortnite.
[00:40.89]I've played it before.
[00:41.63]You sound tall today.
[00:48.39]Do I?
[00:49.41]Interesting.
[00:52.24]I sound tall today.
[00:54.40]Do I sound different today?
[00:56.66]Would you say that I sound a little, uh, a little different today?
[00:59.76]In regards to the other few, uh, few days?
[01:03.39]Few months, maybe?
[01:03.99]Yeah?
[01:08.93]Hmm.
[01:11.67]No, there is no... I don't notice anything.
[01:13.93]No, I don't know.
[01:14.97]Did you change something?
[01:16.45]Interesting.
[01:17.85]I went back to the other mic.
[01:20.98]And I had someone here that went through all the audio settings and tried to solve the mystery of why my microphone sounds so bad.
[01:28.32]This is the other microphone.
[01:32.56]And let's do a scream test.
[01:35.07]Fixed it.
[01:40.29]By the way, thanks a lot.
[01:41.81]Audio Community Jake.
[01:52.61]You smoked a ball and watched?
[01:54.21]Hey, can you get over here and fix this?
[02:01.09]I just smoke.
[02:03.21]You want money?
[02:03.75]No, you're not getting any of that.
[02:10.99]Be honest with me, are we good?
[02:14.27]Are we actually good?
[02:15.43]For real?
[02:16.77]Like, do I sound fine?
[02:17.85]Do I need to be louder?
[02:19.44]Are we good finally?
[02:20.62]Am I finally good?
[02:21.54]Can I get louder?
[02:22.30]Can we test it?
[02:22.98]Do I sound fine?
[02:24.18]Am I good to go now?
[02:25.48]Am I a live streamer after 12 fucking years?
[02:28.18]Do I sound okay?
[02:36.23]Now we just need to fix the webcam.
[02:39.19]Which is... I'm never changing it, by the way.
[02:41.27]I did move it about two inches.
[02:44.91]Anyways, welcome.
[02:46.25]I will be the first to welcome you.

[05:06.53]Why are you not free?
[05:07.51]What game would be on this list that you would be happy with?
[05:09.57]There's every genre.
[05:13.47]Some of these are some of the highest rated games that come out in the last like five, ten years.
[05:17.59]What would be on here?
[05:18.47]Roblox?
[05:19.31]Why would I play Roblox?

[05:22.69]How am I gonna play Fortnite?
[05:26.55]How come Ghostbusters 2011 is not on there?
[05:28.23]Because it's not on here.
[05:29.85]This is Omega Gaming Weekend and I picked the game.
[05:39.12]Boring list.
[05:42.62]The original Plants vs. Zombies is like, holy shit.
[05:46.91]I would have freaked out if I heard that and I was in the chat.
[05:55.72]And maybe at some point during this weekend, you might be able to face me in multiverses.
[06:01.75]I'll see you in the multiverses.
[06:04.51]There's no sponsor this weekend.
[06:05.51]Let me just be clear.
[06:06.47]I'm just like fucking around.
[06:10.28]There's no sponsor or anything.
[06:11.34]I'm just, I'm being a weirdo.
[06:12.42]Alright.
[06:12.74]So here's what we're going to do.
[06:13.86]There was a poll in pre-stream.
[06:15.06]If you weren't here, then well, sorry.
[06:17.46]We're going to start with feed and grow fish.
[06:23.09]I don't think the multiplayer works.
[06:24.37]I tried it a few times.
[06:26.11]It doesn't work.
[06:26.79]So we're just going to do single player.
[06:30.19]And I'm here like 40 minutes early, so relax.
[06:35.43]You know, honestly, I really shouldn't have even said the list out loud because I could have said, hey, I got 25 games and some of you game andies that I'm mad that, you know, Mario Galaxy 2 isn't on here.
[06:47.43]You might have thought it was on here.
[06:48.71]I could have just pretended like, oh, no, there's other stuff on here.
[06:51.35]You don't, you never know what's on here.
[07:01.11]Yeah.
[07:03.67]None of these are for- I know, I'm just- I'm being a weirdo.
[07:05.73]Alright, so we're gonna start.
[07:06.59]Let's go.
[07:06.93]This is Omega Gaming Weekend, and I'm your host, Derma985.
[07:11.38]How are you?
[07:14.00]New angle?
[07:14.40]What do you think?
[07:17.24]New audio?
[07:18.06]New angle?
[07:18.90]It's a little bit over here.
[07:19.76]It's not as weird, right?
[07:21.09]I was told it by somebody very, very reliable that it was weird, and I couldn't understand.
[07:34.24]Somebody told me, the camera angle the last time, the last two times have been fucking weird.
[07:38.59]I was like, no, there's no way you're saying that.
[07:41.93]There's no, it's impossible.
[07:45.41]Like, no.
[07:46.57]My own girlfriend says this.
[07:50.71]I was like, there's no way.
[07:52.19]There's no fucking way.
[07:53.55]I looked fine.
[07:55.21]Why was it so weird?
[07:56.37]It's just a webcam.
[07:57.73]It's just a facecam.
[07:58.75]Who cares?
[08:00.05]Who cares?
[08:00.55]Does it really matter?
[08:04.64]It's every, everybody is against me.
[08:08.36]From community Jake, to my girlfriend, to my entire community, to my parents.
[08:13.60]I had my mother look at it.
[08:15.32]She was like, you look strange, honey.
[08:19.50]I'm just like, no, everyone's against me.
[08:21.06]Nobody gets it.
[08:24.24]Nobody gets it but me.
[08:24.98]You know what I'm saying?
[08:28.33]I don't know, that was supposed to be a neck crack.
[08:30.83]Alright, let's go.
[08:32.55]This is a game where you have to... You have to eat, and you have to grow, and... I don't know.
[08:39.78]People said to play it.
[08:40.52]This is what we're starting with.
[08:42.12]Let's start in the river.
[08:42.82]We'll do medium.
[08:45.68]Wait, this is too quiet.
[08:50.61]Can you guys hear anything?
[08:53.55]There we go.
[08:53.95]Now I can hear it.
[08:55.09]Alright, let's go.
[08:55.57]This is a child game.
[09:01.29]I...
[09:04.98]Alright, I got a hatch.
[09:05.90]So this is a game, it's like, what's that game that came out like 20 years ago?
[09:09.12]You have to, you have to don't get eaten, but you have to eat fish.
[09:15.43]Eat five and raise four babies.
[09:24.42]How do I?
[09:24.60]Is this thing attacking me?
[09:26.18]How do I eat?
[09:29.30]This is my mouth.
[09:36.62]Am I eating this?
[09:39.96]Is that my mouth opening and closing?
[09:45.04]What's that?
[09:49.71]Oh, it's candy.
[09:51.15]Candy!
[09:54.13]Whoa, that's alive!
[09:56.81]Was it alive?
[09:57.39]Hey, get out of here.
[09:59.21]This is mine.
[10:09.36]Wait, there's a little one right here.
[10:10.56]Do I eat snails?
[10:19.13]What can I eat?
[10:19.79]Do I have to eat the candies and that's it?
[10:29.06]Where's my fish?
[10:30.70]Oh, there I am.
[10:37.71]How could you not like it?
[10:38.75]Look on the left.
[10:40.03]Yeah, I need to eat.
[10:40.47]What does that mean?
[10:44.22]How do I turn?
[10:44.82]Whoa, shit!
[10:54.35]Okay, where do I eat food?
[10:56.41]Can I walk yet?
[10:57.83]Oh, shit!
[11:01.31]There he is!
[11:07.78]He's not coming for me, right?
[11:16.98]Oh, wait a minute.
[11:25.81]Oh, no, I feel bad.
[11:26.83]That was like horrible.
[11:27.85]That was like horrible.
[11:31.21]How do I grow up?
[11:35.44]It looks like the hunter became the hunted.
[11:42.96]Where are we all going?
[11:47.83]I don't know where I'm supposed to be going.
[11:51.07]Do I just wait and be a scavenger?
[11:52.25]How's my health going down?
[12:01.79]My health is going... What do I do?
[12:03.01]Do I eat rocks?
[12:08.72]Wait, there it is.
[12:16.99]Get it!
[12:26.38]How do you eat?
[12:27.06]Am I dead?
[12:37.66]Can I just attach to this?
[12:41.50]What's the break button?
[12:43.17]I'm dead.
[12:44.43]Okay, that was fun.
[12:45.69]Now I... It wasn't even clear what I needed to do.
[13:09.71]Okay.
[13:11.03]Eat five of those.
[13:12.16]I'm not big enough to eat five of those.
[13:18.06]Get out of here.
[13:23.28]What am I even eating?
[13:28.75]Dude, I can't eat anything.
[13:34.93]What?
[13:35.13]What?
[13:39.30]That's your brother.
[13:40.16]It's a good thing I didn't eat him.
[13:49.60]We're gonna stick together, bro.
[13:56.79]Let's stay together.
[14:08.69]survival of the fittest bro sorry where'd he go oh wait this is bad oh no you're in trouble okay bye dude what the nature sucks like imagine being a little minnow or something you're born and you're just dead what that's terrible

[14:35.65]Gone.
[14:36.99]You don't even know.
[14:37.59]You don't even know that you are alive.
[14:39.53]It's crazy.
[14:42.73]That fish is dead.
[14:46.59]Alright.
[14:46.85]I need to find little things to eat.
[14:51.74]How do you turn?
[14:52.62]Am I swimming upstream?
[14:57.12]Is that the problem?
[15:00.40]Alright, this group, but we can hang out with this group.
[15:02.36]I'm dead.
[15:03.24]OK, great.
[15:09.40]This guy is a maniac.
[15:18.23]Are you kidding me?
[15:18.87]I'm coming for that guy.
[15:23.97]I have to at least get to the next height, right?
[15:31.26]Okay, what is small enough for me to eat?
[15:33.80]I have to find food that's been ripped up already, and then we just eat it.
[15:41.01]Okay, I'm going this way.
[15:52.13]Don't run into me.
[15:55.77]Terraria music?
[15:56.47]Kind of sounds like that, but what do I... I can't eat it.
[16:00.89]Wouldn't that be just... Is it stuff on the ground?
[16:04.19]What about this?
[16:04.99]This is like a grasshopper.
[16:07.39]Okay, you can eat the grasshoppers.
[16:08.67]Good.
[16:09.29]Thanks.
[16:17.44]You can eat the little grasshopper shrimp.
[16:24.37]I can't, actually.
[16:30.42]Are you small enough?
[16:36.25]No.
[16:38.89]Left, left, left.
[16:40.43]What?
[16:43.91]No, it's too big.
[16:48.34]Top left, top left.
[16:50.48]Eat five of those.
[16:51.22]They're too big.
[16:53.92]Why can you eat that and I can't?
[16:55.98]I don't get it.
[16:57.84]Why can you eat that and I can't?
[17:02.26]I don't understand.
[17:02.90]What do you mean wrong button?
[17:03.76]It's not left click?
[17:24.51]Right click.
[17:32.39]There we go.
[17:32.97]Alright, I figured out how to play.
[17:39.33]That was sad.
[17:39.95]I don't want to eat the snails.
[17:43.21]They're only one XP.
[17:44.05]This is going to take all day to get higher.
[17:47.95]Wait, there's worms?
[17:55.36]Just stay on the ground.
[17:56.20]I'm not going anywhere.
[17:56.90]Yeah, just eat these worms.
[18:08.60]If I hide in this area, the big ones won't get... This game is a horror game.
[18:22.97]Alright.
[18:23.81]Stay on the ground.
[18:28.05]Get over here, you fucking grasshopper.
[18:38.19]Don't even think about it.
[18:38.81]This is safe in here, I think.
[18:52.30]Okay.
[18:53.50]Halfway?
[18:58.00]You're getting toxic.
[19:00.70]I'm just trying to level up once.
[19:11.59]Hopefully my brothers and sisters made it.
[19:17.25]Oh shit.
[19:25.95]Wait, I just got a huge amount of experience.
[19:27.79]For what?
[19:32.46]Yo, you can do first person.
[19:33.38]No, you can't.
[19:36.60]Look at how dirty that one is.
[19:41.23]Alright, come on.
[19:41.73]I'm so close to leveling.
[19:51.37]Level up.
[19:52.13]Alright.
[19:52.49]Am I bigger?
[19:52.99]I am a little bigger.
[19:54.77]Okay.
[20:00.21]Uh... What can I fit in my mouth now?
[20:03.48]I'm gonna snipe this.
[20:18.60]I sniped it.
[20:36.52]What's wrong with me?
[20:37.28]Why am I dying?
[20:40.87]Oh, that's not filling anymore.
[20:41.93]Alright.
[20:42.79]I need to scavenge, I think.
[20:48.22]Maybe I can eat the little ones.
[20:50.32]Let's see.
[20:51.21]I can eat these still.
[20:57.01]You know, sometimes my brain decides to think a certain way.
[21:03.29]And I was just concerned that I was going to drown.
[21:05.17]I was like, oh, do I have to go up for air?
[21:07.04]Because where's my air meter?
[21:08.50]And I'm like, wait, that doesn't make any sense.
[21:13.33]In my brain, for one second, I was not a fish.
[21:15.61]I was a person down here.
[21:17.01]Or I was a different, like an animal or something.
[21:18.42]Wait, danger.
[21:19.06]Oh!
[21:34.13]I'm not supposed to be here.
[21:38.45]Nemo did not show up here.
[21:46.30]How do I get back up?
[21:47.01]How do I climb back up?
[21:48.43]How do I climb back up?
[21:54.71]I went to the next area.
[21:56.33]Okay, wait.
[21:56.85]I might be able to scavenge.
[22:08.26]This is definitely a scavenge scenario.
[22:09.65]Look at all these.
[22:11.86]Okay, here we go.
[22:14.09]And... Oh, never mind.
[22:21.91]Oh shit, that's one of my friends.
[22:24.63]How'd you get down here?
[22:26.09]It's alright, I got you.
[22:30.34]Try to eat him.
[22:36.22]Oh my god, hide in the... hide in the murkiness.
[22:48.30]I just got baited so bad.
[22:49.46]That was terrifying.
[22:50.12]This game is scary.
[22:53.18]You know where this would be crazy?
[22:54.52]It's VR.
[22:55.04]Can you imagine having to deal with this in VR?
[22:57.90]You're not gonna eat.
[23:02.83]I'm way too small of a fry for you.
[23:05.43]But... Oh, shit.
[23:07.13]You ate it in one gulp.
[23:07.95]Okay, I was gonna say break it up for me.
[23:09.81]I'm gonna follow you.
[23:12.95]I'm following the big chunky one.
[23:15.05]Because nobody's gonna fuck with the big chunky one, right?
[23:16.77]And the big chunky one will...
[23:19.18]Leave some scraps.
[23:28.19]Don't be stupid.
[23:29.47]Alright, here we go.
[23:33.41]There's no chance anyone's gonna fuck with the big chunky guy.
[23:36.20]Hold on.
[23:40.72]Did I get any?
[23:41.48]Shit, I didn't get any.
[23:44.70]Ow!
[23:48.53]I'm dead.
[23:49.45]Oh my god, I was so close.
[23:51.59]Alright, I'm good.
[23:52.61]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[23:53.66]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[23:57.84]What fish are you?
[23:58.58]I actually don't have any idea.
[24:00.82]Shit.
[24:01.84]Oh, that's so frustrating.
[24:03.70]I'm too impatient to play this.
[24:07.07]I swam directly into one of their mouths.
[24:24.02]I got some.
[24:26.34]Alright, that's a huge chunk.
[24:36.91]Deathmatch is quicker.
[24:38.29]I'll try this another couple times.
[24:39.77]You pick the fish that you want to start as, I think, right?
[24:42.45]That's how I understand it.
[24:58.19]This is really dumb what I'm doing, but whatever.
[24:59.79]There's a look at the frenzy over here.
[25:11.84]I need to eat something.
[25:15.52]I can't swim down.
[25:21.10]The current is so strong here.
[25:22.56]I actually cannot move.
[25:40.32]Is that a snail?
[25:43.18]What is this snail doing?
[25:51.17]Is that a hook?
[25:53.79]Is it a hook?
[25:58.46]He's tripping.
[26:18.60]Alright, come on.
[26:19.77]How am I not getting full from this?
[26:28.37]Am I sprinting too much?
[26:32.65]I'm fine.
[26:34.66]Get off me!
[26:35.22]Get off!
[26:37.94]Get away from me!
[26:38.84]Oh my god, this game's hard.
[26:40.10]Fuck!
[26:45.76]Oh...
[26:55.02]Okay, let's go.
[27:02.28]What's the strat here?
[27:06.78]I'm just going to float on the bottom and just... I'm going to coast.
[27:09.48]I'm not going to dash unless I hear the scary sound.
[27:16.55]Yeah, please.
[27:17.33]Seriously, get out of here.
[27:18.87]Go eat something that's way bigger.
[27:21.51]You're really going to come after the one single McDonald's french fry when there are cheeseburgers in the ocean?
[27:26.41]When there are steaks in the ocean floating around?
[27:28.07]You're going to eat the one single fucking McDonald's french fry.
[27:30.91]Get out of here.
[27:32.29]Fuck off.
[27:38.42]It's true though.
[27:44.10]Already leveled up.
[27:52.82]Like, mmm, this looks delicious.
[27:55.17]Yeah, you know the crumbs that are on the counter after you make a sandwich?
[28:00.15]Mmm.
[28:01.03]Don't eat the sandwich, though.
[28:02.03]That literally swam away.
[28:03.69]It ran away.
[28:04.13]It ran by you.
[28:16.96]I'm not going that way.
[28:22.66]You look handsome today.
[28:24.58]Thanks.
[28:32.36]Stop YouTube reacting.
[28:34.83]You're fine.
[28:38.69]You actually he's right next to me.
[28:40.67]OK, how do I get out of here?
[28:43.37]Eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him.
[28:48.37]Eat him, eat him.
[28:49.58]He's he tastes better.
[28:52.41]He was he was he was dipped in beer batter oil.
[29:01.05]I'm.
[29:02.99]What the fuck is happening?
[29:10.12]Why are we all getting sucked into like wormhole?
[29:12.58]Oh no, I'm out of here.
[29:15.50]I am out of here.
[29:18.46]Go back down to the sea floor.
[29:25.89]I'm not messing around now.
[29:30.60]Why am I dying?
[29:32.00]Oh, I'm hungry.
[29:40.32]Come on.
[29:45.35]What?
[29:48.79]How many of these do I have to eat before I'm fine?
[29:53.50]Oh God.
[29:54.40]This is so fucking hard.
[29:57.06]I got better.
[30:06.22]I got better.
[30:06.70]I got better.
[30:07.04]Oh, fuck this.
[30:08.54]Come on.
[30:14.47]Poor little fella.
[30:15.35]Okay.
[30:18.53]What am I doing wrong here?
[30:25.95]Let us eat it.
[30:31.60]Leave some for me too.
[30:32.58]You can't just eat it all.
[30:35.04]You took two of those.
[30:36.08]That's not fair.
[30:36.52]We should have split it exactly one and a half, one and a half.
[30:42.19]Hey, if mom didn't just get eaten, I would tell her.
[30:44.23]Time to leave.
[30:57.23]Can we take this thing?
[30:59.33]Oh no, no!
[31:01.91]Brother!
[31:04.13]What do I do?
[31:04.91]Can I stop this?
[31:06.67]Brother, I need to tell you something.
[31:09.11]If you die, I'm gonna eat your body.
[31:11.19]Just letting you know.
[31:19.98]That's the way it is, right?
[31:21.24]That's the way of nature, unfortunately.
[31:24.02]Okay.
[31:26.56]Save a seed at the... Oh.
[31:34.02]I think he's dead.
[31:35.26]No, he's still alive.
[31:36.96]He's still alive.
[31:37.50]He's still alive.
[31:45.83]This is so sad.
[31:46.79]No, not me.
[31:56.96]He's still alive.
[32:02.49]I'm gonna die if I don't eat something right now.
[32:06.37]You piece of shit.
[32:07.59]I swear to God.
[32:31.34]If I go even five feet above the ground, I'm gonna uninstall Steam.
[32:36.75]You understand?
[32:37.47]Like, for this round, don't leave the floor.
[32:40.51]Just eat everything on the floor.
[32:41.45]Why am I flying around looking at stuff?
[32:43.49]This is guaranteed death.
[32:46.05]Look at all these scrumptious things down here.
[32:54.84]That's not five feet.
[32:55.58]That's like two feet.
[32:57.28]Well, actually two feet.
[32:58.64]We're talking about the scale of the actual game.
[33:10.25]Here we go.
[33:10.57]Alright.
[33:10.85]Nice.
[33:13.15]Oh, chop that up.
[33:14.63]Chop him up.
[33:15.05]Chop him up.
[33:15.45]Chop him up.
[33:16.15]I'll level up immediately.
[33:17.19]Can I help?
[33:17.93]Did he just hit me with a tail?
[33:26.58]I got experience for being around that when it died.
[33:41.82]It's too big, I can't eat it.
[33:53.30]Whoa!
[33:53.58]Okay, don't be stupid, don't be greedy.
[33:55.10]Alright, get out, get out, get out.
[33:59.12]I'm almost level 3.
[33:59.50]I need more, I'm hungry.
[34:21.89]Eat him in his sleep.
[34:36.08]Come on.
[34:53.64]This game is so funny.
[34:54.66]God damn it.
[35:01.39]Can we just like latch onto this guy and like attack him?
[35:05.40]No, I can't.
[35:06.24]Why didn't, I couldn't break my, what do I have, gums?
[35:09.38]I have one tooth.
[35:20.40]Do not even go one or two five feet above where you are right now until level two.
[35:26.42]Just stay on the ground.
[35:27.96]Don't get up for anything.
[35:31.39]Eat the grasshoppers.
[35:32.15]Okay.
[35:43.14]Stay down here for now.
[35:54.90]Only go up if I see an opportunity.
[35:56.34]No other reason.
[35:59.88]Opportunity.
[36:01.82]Okay.
[36:02.08]Pull on everything.
[36:04.14]I just got a ton of experience.
[36:07.22]Something big died around here somewhere.
[36:09.68]Alright, this is huge.
[36:12.78]This is huge.
[36:15.48]I might actually be able to see what the hell level 3 looks like.
[36:28.42]Almost there.
[36:28.78]Can I eat that?
[36:34.57]Get away from me!
[36:35.29]Alright, now you want to go?
[36:36.27]You want to go now?
[36:39.32]Yeah, get munched.
[36:41.22]Didn't expect me to grow up, did you?
[36:54.55]I'll take you instead.
[36:56.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:57.26]I'm running out of food.
[36:58.94]Just go back down to the snails and shit.
[37:08.62]Okay, am I right?
[37:17.33]Whoa!
[37:24.91]Is that one of... Are you a friend?
[37:32.55]Why are you... Look, he's green.
[37:35.52]I need to help him.
[37:38.58]Stop fighting.
[37:39.20]What are you doing?
[37:39.90]You can't take that on.
[37:40.94]Are you out of your mind?
[37:41.92]I'll help you.
[37:45.78]We can eat this.
[37:46.22]We can eat this.
[37:46.58]We can eat this.
[37:51.53]Wow, you're so fast.
[37:55.20]Are you still with me?
[37:58.18]Oh, he doesn't look so good.
[37:58.94]He's green.
[38:01.34]No!
[38:04.84]Don't mess with that.
[38:05.53]Alright.
[38:07.27]Wait, wait.
[38:07.79]Opportunity.
[38:09.49]I don't know what to do.
[38:10.59]I'm just floating.
[38:11.85]I'm just floating right now.
[38:12.69]I don't know what to do.
[38:13.19]I'm freaking out.
[38:18.06]No.
[38:18.14]No, greenie.
[38:19.54]Stay with us.
[38:19.96]Oh!
[38:29.06]It's impossible.
[38:30.52]It's impossible.
[38:31.62]That was a new rare species, and we'll never know.
[38:45.82]Don't go near the big fish.
[38:48.65]The current is just taking me.
[38:50.97]I can't.
[38:51.53]I have to.
[38:52.21]The current is just moving me.
[39:07.32]Help me.
[39:07.78]Somebody.
[39:10.32]See if you fucking like it.
[39:11.14]You like it?
[39:11.76]Huh?
[39:14.30]David and Goliath time.
[39:22.61]Did that hurt?
[39:27.55]They were just reacting to that.
[39:30.80]Did you see that?
[39:34.42]He was like... And then just walked away.
[39:42.59]I have to get to level 4 or something.
[39:44.38]There's other areas too.
[39:46.92]Like, what are you even doing in our spawn?
[39:48.62]Spawn camping piece of shit.
[39:49.92]Like, get him out of here.
[39:52.78]You know what I'm saying?
[39:54.46]Like, why can he spawn camp?
[39:55.58]That's not fair.
[39:58.86]Alright.
[39:59.70]Do the same thing I did last time.
[40:14.88]This guy's annoying.
[40:16.26]Yeah.
[40:17.52]Can you please get out?
[40:19.50]Can you please, like, get the fuck out of Un'Goro Crater and go to Northrend where you belong, you fucking asshole?
[40:25.92]What are you doing here?
[40:27.56]Why are you here?
[40:28.28]Oh, I'm getting herbs.
[40:30.35]Oh, shut up.
[40:31.93]Oh, you got how many stacks of herbs do you need?
[40:33.43]I don't know, like six or seven thousand?
[40:37.99]You've been here since four o'clock in the afternoon.
[40:40.97]It is now, like, midnight.
[40:42.37]And I log back on and you're still here killing people.
[40:46.88]I'm just getting nerfed, man.
[40:48.24]No, you're not.
[40:49.08]That's such a dumb excuse.
[40:55.14]Well, not Un'Goro.
[40:56.28]Un'Goro was contested, right?
[40:57.35]I remember there was one of them where he was just like, what are you doing here?
[41:00.15]Strangle.
[41:00.73]There you are.
[41:01.37]Strangle Thornvale.
[41:03.62]Stranglethorn Vale.
[41:04.72]People just stayed there.
[41:06.32]They didn't leave.
[41:07.86]They would be there at level 60.
[41:09.16]It's like a level 30 zone.
[41:11.00]And they would just stay there.
[41:12.42]Permanently.
[41:12.84]I don't even know if they played the rest of the game.
[41:16.98]They got to 60 and went right to Stranglethorn.
[41:24.37]What's he talking about?
[41:25.67]People that... No, no.
[41:29.65]Oh, I'm gonna starve.
[41:36.90]current is too strong.
[41:38.14]Oh, no.
[41:38.88]Not the snail.
[41:40.82]Actually, this might be good.
[41:41.46]I'm just going to stay in the bottom.
[41:49.07]You just got to get lucky.
[41:51.69]Thanks for the help.
[41:52.31]I'm going to die.
[41:55.51]Dead.
[41:56.49]Okay.
[41:56.84]I need to focus.
[42:01.35]This game is just like Slither.io, okay?
[42:05.33]You just walk around in a circle until one of the big people die and then you try to inhale as much as possible and not be one of the 10 people that run into each other.
[42:14.96]And then you get to be the big, big dog, right?
[42:18.16]For a little while.
[42:18.73]We're going to stay.
[42:24.03]I want to do this.
[42:26.67]Why are the green ones so aggressive?
[42:28.19]You're just going to die.
[42:34.84]Come on, dude.
[42:35.50]Alright, enough.
[42:42.19]Enough.
[42:42.61]Enough.
[42:42.99]Enough.
[42:43.21]We're not fighting here.
[42:44.35]You're fighting babies.
[42:46.77]You're so tough.
[42:53.56]These are infant children that you are fighting.
[42:56.24]As a group of adults.
[42:59.26]Get out of here.
[43:00.90]You should not be here.
[43:05.20]Imagine going to the, like, peewee leagues as, like, a fucking 40-year-old man and full sprint tackling, like, a fucking 11-year-old and getting up and being like, yeah!
[43:17.11]And, like, high-fiving your other 40-year-old friend that's there, too.
[43:23.05]That's what's happening right now.
[43:25.93]You suck at this.
[43:27.16]This game's hard.
[43:28.48]Will he reach?
[43:28.94]Stop.
[43:29.16]You don't have to gamble if I'm going to make it.
[43:38.03]Does this say?
[43:38.75]Alright, when I get big enough, I'm coming back here and we're going to we're going to bully this person.
[43:45.62]Just wait till I type into general... Just wait till I type into trade chat in Ironforge.
[43:50.66]Somebody please come kill this level 60 undead rogue that won't leave.
[43:56.14]And you get somebody who's like, oh, help.
[43:59.82]Hey, you get the party invite.
[44:02.50]It's like a level 60.
[44:03.54]It's a paladin.
[44:05.05]Paladins in WoW, back in classic WoW, if it was a paladin that responded, they were going to LARP in RP and they were going to help you.
[44:12.43]It was always a paladin.
[44:14.66]And then they would show up and they would point.
[44:17.14]They would do the slash point and then get absolutely eviscerated.
[44:23.60]I already got sucked into the thing.
[44:27.32]They would get eviscerated.
[44:28.22]It was not even a contest, but it was long enough for you to like get out of the way.
[44:31.28]And now it was his problem or it was her problem.
[44:38.88]And then somebody would be like, that person would go, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:41.90]Fuck this.
[44:42.26]I'll be right back.
[44:43.34]They would log out of that paladin and they'd come back on like a shadow priest.
[44:48.17]That's all decked out in like tier two gear.
[44:56.07]All the while you just want.
[45:07.09]God, I'm mad at this fish.
[45:16.95]Stop talking.
[45:17.65]I know.
[45:18.03]I know.
[45:18.31]Alright.
[45:18.53]No more talking.
[45:18.91]I'm not going to talk this whole time.
[45:21.39]I'm not going to speak this whole time.
[45:22.69]I'm going to get to level three right now.
[45:25.70]Okay.
[45:31.24]Is there a map?
[45:31.86]Because I want to mark on the map where this is.
[45:38.36]Alright.
[45:40.98]Stop pushing me.
[45:42.58]No, don't go that way.
[45:49.30]I haven't blinked in like 40 minutes.
[45:52.77]That's mine.
[45:53.25]Don't touch that.
[45:53.81]Thank God, you idiot.
[45:58.25]I got 20 XP because he died.
[46:20.29]That's so stupid.
[46:22.19]No!
[46:22.49]And I stopped paying attention and laughing at the guy.
[46:29.11]It's alright.
[46:29.54]I'm okay.
[46:31.30]Please.
[46:31.72]God damn it, man.
[46:32.92]I am so... I can't play this game.
[46:35.50]It takes too much focus.
[46:36.38]Put both headphones in.
[46:38.90]Don't talk about World of Warcraft.
[46:42.17]Don't talk about Mario.
[46:45.43]Don't talk about anything besides focusing on the game.
[46:51.07]Give me some of my drink.
[47:02.30]I moved you guys over here.
[47:03.74]You used to be over there, but now you're over here.
[47:11.46]I'm going full immersion mode this round.
[47:30.03]We can take him.
[47:31.40]We can take him.
[47:31.88]We can take him.
[47:32.58]We can take him.
[47:35.26]We can take him.
[47:35.66]Come on.
[47:37.78]We can take him.
[47:38.34]We can take him.
[47:44.94]Did we get it?
[47:49.61]You ate it!
[48:11.38]Go get your own food.
[48:20.47]Go get your own food.
[48:22.07]Is that Carl?
[48:25.05]I don't... I mean, there are 400 million of us that were just born like an hour ago.
[48:29.12]I don't know who... You could be... You might be Carl.
[48:47.63]Points, what?
[48:48.87]Easy money, what?
[48:49.61]What do you mean easy money?
[48:54.15]What did you guys just do?
[49:09.51]Come here.
[49:10.45]These ones are fucking fast.
[49:14.74]We have to get this, otherwise we're going to die.
[49:19.26]Don't eat it all.
[49:25.57]If you eat that all, I swear to God.
[49:49.97]Oh, that's a juicy one.
[49:54.61]Holy shit!
[49:55.55]Oh my god!
[49:57.25]Am I alright?
[50:13.61]That was, that was bad.
[50:14.99]That was very bad.
[50:16.41]I'm sorry.
[50:18.73]I'm actually sorry about that.
[50:19.65]I actually freaked the fuck out.
[50:23.64]How do I repair?
[50:24.42]Can I heal?
[50:30.76]Get, no, stop.
[50:31.82]Get away from me.
[50:34.66]I'm so close.
[50:35.44]No, I'm so close.
[50:36.56]Where's my... No, my God.
[50:47.40]I know this is Omega Gaming Weekend.
[50:54.30]But I'm playing this a little more.
[50:56.76]I'm not leaving yet.
[50:59.27]Not on a note like this.
[51:01.05]This guy's such a scumbag.
[51:13.44]That fish is on a patrol to just eat children.
[51:18.41]Really?
[51:20.41]Don't go that way.
[51:24.75]Yeah, I'm just going to come back every few hours and see how many more children I can eat.
[51:33.30]That's a pit stop.
[51:34.32]He's stopping.
[51:36.88]On his way back home.
[51:38.38]Well, let's eat some more big children.
[51:48.91]like hit their heads it's like I caught him and he was so startled that I caught him what he was doing that he freaked out alright here's some snacks over here good we're good
[52:24.21]Can somebody confirm, does dashing... Does dashing take food?
[52:30.31]I haven't really been able to see it.
[52:37.26]It's leveling up is what's doing that.
[52:38.94]Okay.
[52:45.70]I'm not going anywhere without full food.
[52:55.68]Where is everybody?
[53:01.98]Where did everybody go?
[53:06.65]Did they all go into that waterfall section?
[53:08.83]Level three, bro.
[53:12.87]Coming up.
[53:15.91]Please die.
[53:16.61]I don't think it's going to happen this time.
[53:29.19]Don't get overconfident.
[53:34.70]All the big fish, I think, have left to go to the second area.
[53:38.04]I think I'll be alright.
[53:42.67]I have a never-ending supply of bugs.
[53:44.63]Why did I just lose hunger?
[53:49.31]What just happened?
[53:50.49]That was weird.
[54:01.91]I honestly, I think I lucked out here.
[54:03.49]The RNG went nuts and I think it sucked every single fish into that second part.
[54:14.34]Except for you.
[54:16.52]I'm level three.
[54:17.82]What do I do?
[54:19.38]Should I go after him?
[54:20.40]No, not yet.
[54:22.86]I'm still gonna eat bugs for a little while.
[54:39.98]What's that?
[54:41.28]Oh, it's shrimp.
[54:46.92]Am I ready for the next zone?
[54:50.87]Not yet.
[54:51.21]What was that?
[54:55.33]What was that?
[55:09.16]That big guy is still here.
[55:10.46]I just saw him.
[55:25.39]Yeah, I'm being complete patient only.
[55:44.60]Did everyone left?
[55:46.50]I'm gonna go through the waterfall and it's gonna be mayhem.
[55:49.04]I'm almost level 4.
[55:57.76]Wait!
[56:00.70]Wait a minute!
[56:01.93]That wasn't... We were trying to kill that!
[56:05.93]There was at least a few times where we were biting... I was biting and attacking this and it was... I think it was my mother.
[56:12.41]It wasn't coming back every hour to eat the children.
[56:16.25]It was coming back to take care of us and protect us.
[56:20.63]Oh, boy.
[56:21.25]Alright.
[56:21.66]Don't lose this.
[56:23.02]Where do I go?
[56:23.50]Oh, I'm going to be on a frenzy here.
[56:28.74]Where do I go?
[56:30.80]Where's the waterfall?
[56:38.96]Ow.
[56:40.14]Where's the waterfall?
[56:40.72]Where's the waterfall?
[56:41.20]Where's the waterfall?
[56:46.41]way alright let's go go go go go go go I'm gonna I'm so much bigger than everybody let's go oh hey what's going on remember me
[57:25.18]It's not fair.
[57:26.10]These guys are huge.
[57:28.44]What?
[57:55.50]Choosing different fish.
[57:56.30]It's not working.
[58:00.82]That was not working.
[58:02.86]Different fish.
[58:09.55]So I was screaming like this was a horror game at the mother coming back every time.
[58:17.70]That's so stupid.
[58:30.46]Aren't you?
[58:30.88]No, you're... No.
[58:33.12]Where are you people coming from?
[58:35.28]Where are all these people coming from?
[58:44.06]Where were they even coming from?
[58:45.03]I don't get it.
[58:57.05]I'm going to the swamp.
[59:05.15]Let's grab madness.
[59:06.27]I don't know.
[59:09.85]There's probably different fishes here.
[59:15.89]Wait, I could be the dinosaur.
[59:17.06]Alright, I want to be the alligator.
[59:29.71]That was a different species, by the way.
[59:33.89]The thing that I thought was a shiny special green one.
[59:40.17]No, that's why it was so aggressive.
[59:45.46]I thought it was one of my friends.
[59:47.02]I should have just eaten him.
[59:49.40]Alright, let's move.
[59:53.26]Is the strategy to stay with the mother?
[59:56.24]Yeah, of course it is.
[60:06.34]No shit, really?
[60:12.36]You gotta be kidding me.
[60:13.94]This is the OK mom with mom go.
[60:17.44]With mom.
[60:30.27]Let me have some.
[60:40.63]This is what I should have been doing the whole time.
[60:42.55]Are you kidding me?
[60:43.27]That's so frustrating.
[60:45.81]I'm level two already.
[60:51.20]Mom.
[60:56.90]Don't leave us.
[61:00.06]Mom.
[61:04.26]Mom.
[61:04.74]Uh-oh.
[61:10.76]What do we do now?
[61:12.04]Oh, um... We gotta stick together.
[61:19.77]I don't know what to do.
[61:32.59]I think we can kill that.
[61:33.73]I'm starving.
[61:41.79]Drink the blood, can I drink the blood?
[61:54.73]Do not eat that!
[61:59.41]You piece of shit, I swear to God, you better not get that.
[62:01.41]Get him, get him, come on!
[62:08.96]Good job, good, good, good fight, good fight.
[62:12.95]He's retreating, retreating, retreating, retreating, retreating.
[62:15.61]I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him.
[62:23.75]Retreating.
[62:26.93]Stunning, stunning.
[62:29.99]Consecrating, consecrate, consecration.
[62:32.17]Stun.
[62:33.67]I gotta, I gotta, I gotta trinket, I gotta trinket out, trinket out, trinket out, trinket out.
[62:38.44]I need, I need shield, I need power shield.
[62:42.83]Got a stun?
[62:45.48]You fucking idiot.
[62:49.08]I don't even know where I am.
[62:55.07]Where am I?
[63:13.20]Can I eat you just whole or what?
[63:15.54]No.
[63:16.60]But I can kill you, though.
[63:17.58]Can't I just grab?
[63:22.89]It's so hard to fucking aim.
[63:29.17]Dude, eat him!
[63:30.95]You're right next to him!
[63:32.29]Eat him!
[63:34.43]How hard is it to grab?
[63:38.56]Just eat him!
[63:45.91]Eat!
[63:47.28]Eat that!
[63:49.24]Eat that!
[63:52.68]Eat that!
[63:55.37]Eat that!
[63:59.39]Eat that!
[64:00.41]Eat that!
[64:16.44]I don't think I'm ever going to make it.
[64:40.19]Poisonous fish.
[64:41.01]I was wondering, was I allergic to that food?
[64:46.50]I don't appreciate you calling me a cigarette, Andy.
[64:48.28]I want an apology.
[64:54.70]Whoa!
[64:55.52]Is that a catfish?
[64:57.45]Alright, where's mom?
[64:59.49]Mom, are you gonna fight the catfish?
[65:02.39]I think so.
[65:02.99]Are we gonna get a battle?
[65:04.51]Alright, this time don't lose the mom.
[65:15.17]This is going to be insane amount of food.
[65:26.93]Can I have some or what?
[65:29.10]Really guys?
[65:30.88]Really?
[65:32.18]That's so ridiculous.
[65:34.08]I can't wait.
[65:34.50]That was an entire, it was like 10 months worth of food.
[65:39.08]Where's mom?
[65:44.61]That's not that's not my mom.
[65:46.29]That's not mom.
[65:58.59]Alright, get.
[66:04.13]Really, I wish there was a horn I could do like.
[66:14.24]You gonna let me have some?
[66:23.89]I'm gonna starve.
[66:29.79]It has to be broken down to eat, but by the time it gets broken down, she just eats it.
[66:36.83]Somebody said, dude, is this what fish do all day?
[66:38.83]Yeah!
[66:41.51]Yeah, dude!
[66:42.61]Yeah!
[66:53.67]Can you eat something?
[66:54.57]Can you please kill something for me?
[66:56.97]You killed everything already, and I'm just gonna starve to death next to you, and then you're probably gonna eat me.
[67:10.19]No!
[67:10.99]Mom!
[67:12.13]Mom!
[67:13.46]Mom!
[67:14.98]I need to eat, I'm sorry!
[67:20.11]Oh my god.
[67:20.85]Oh my god.
[67:21.61]I'm fucking traumatized for life.
[67:23.98]I'm traumatized for life.
[67:26.30]Is there- are you a friend?
[67:29.20]What are- what the hell is that?
[67:31.28]What is this thing?
[67:32.22]Are you- can you help me?
[67:33.06]Can we be friends?
[67:35.67]You don't seem hostile, but maybe you can help me.
[67:37.57]There's a big scary guppy out there.
[67:40.29]There he is!
[67:54.16]Come on.
[67:55.10]Oh, that was so terrible.
[67:56.60]That was so sad.
[68:01.00]Oh, I didn't like any of that.
[68:07.84]No, I'm not big enough.
[68:09.22]I'm about to die.
[68:10.12]I wonder if there's a heal.
[68:15.24]Maybe if I, it's like Minecraft.
[68:16.42]If I have full hunger, I can heal.
[68:21.44]Let's test that theory.
[68:27.47]Is that theory testing?
[68:28.27]Where's my friend?
[68:32.19]I had a friend down here.
[68:32.81]Where is he?
[68:33.07]Where's my friend?
[68:35.73]Oh, shit.
[68:38.70]I did heal.
[68:39.24]Okay.
[68:48.48]I'm bleeding, I think.
[68:49.94]Oh, this is not good.
[68:53.25]You can smell that, can't you?
[68:56.68]Friendly?
[68:58.58]No.
[68:59.34]That's the bastard that killed my mother.
[69:03.69]No, don't do it.
[69:04.39]Don't do it.
[69:04.67]You're not strong enough.
[69:20.12]What's he doing?
[69:20.76]No, he's not going to be able to do it.
[69:21.90]Dead.
[69:33.65]Turn the music down.
[69:34.35]Let's do that.
[69:41.95]Alright, this time.
[69:47.21]I thought that was a giant whale or something.
[69:49.64]Alright.
[69:50.38]I need to eat.
[69:51.30]Stop eating all the food.
[69:52.66]I have to be quick.
[69:56.98]If you're going to do the mom strat, then you have to really, really be right.
[69:59.98]I'm just going to spam right click.
[70:28.44]Okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[70:33.39]Holy shit!
[70:34.37]That's so much food for everybody!
[70:38.83]There's food for everyone here!
[70:39.95]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[70:46.99]Oh my god, I'm level 3.
[70:47.70]Where'd Mom go?
[70:50.18]I'm too big to look.
[70:55.14]No, don't bite Mom!
[70:56.24]Are you stupid?
[70:56.84]You idiot!
[71:21.32]Get that one too, mom.
[71:24.73]Nice.
[71:29.65]Nice one.
[71:32.23]Yes!
[71:32.69]Alright.
[71:34.41]I'm good.
[71:34.85]I'm gonna stick together though, I think.
[71:40.56]Okay, I need to eat all this stuff and then I need to have children.
[71:46.74]I think that's a good idea.
[71:49.78]That's a huge grip.
[71:54.38]I don't think I need to stick together.
[71:55.62]I'm an absolute carnivore, aren't I?
[71:57.40]I'm so bad at this.
[72:09.18]Mom, I actually still need your help.
[72:10.73]There we go.
[72:26.70]This is like some other thing.
[72:28.42]This is another turf, right?
[72:30.06]Alright, hold on.
[72:30.50]Hey!
[72:41.57]Well, I guess that's fair.
[72:42.43]That's fair.
[72:44.67]What about this thing?
[72:45.25]Mom!
[72:49.65]Why did that hurt?
[72:55.49]Why does it hurt me?
[73:08.63]It has spines?
[73:09.49]Oh shit, okay.
[73:15.58]I need to move to a different place.
[73:16.78]What is that?
[73:19.74]Oh, that's a meaty fish.
[73:23.40]Hey!
[73:31.32]I can't kill that?
[73:32.68]Why not?
[73:34.99]Is it too big?
[73:44.35]No, come here.
[73:45.31]Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[73:57.57]After perception.
[74:02.93]It's hard to land hits.
[74:10.31]Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[74:13.60]Crap.
[74:23.84]Nice.
[74:30.57]You piece of shit.
[74:32.95]Alright, I gotta hide because I need to heal.
[74:34.39]Any more crabs?
[74:47.18]Ooh, alright, alright, alright.
[74:48.40]Let me help you.
[74:50.04]Holy shit, it's an Omega Snake!
[75:21.19]Where are these other fish that I need to eat?
[75:22.57]Almost all six.
[76:04.72]It was rocks.
[76:07.18]Look like shit.
[76:09.32]OK, let's go over here.
[76:29.77]What is that stuff?
[76:37.38]Why is the music changing?
[76:43.78]Mine.
[76:44.17]My food now.
[76:46.95]Oh, you wanna go?
[76:48.37]Level 7.
[76:49.63]You wanna go?
[76:50.81]Which one?
[76:52.29]Oh, I remember you.
[76:54.11]You remember me?
[76:55.37]I watched you kill my mother!
[77:00.81]Alright, I'm done.
[77:01.33]The game's over.
[77:01.97]I'm done.
[77:02.25]I'm actually done playing the game.
[77:09.19]That's fun.
[77:11.13]That was fun.
[77:11.73]That sucked.
[77:29.59]I'll try Deathmatch.
[77:37.54]What should I play after this?
[77:38.24]I got a lot.
[77:43.10]Anything else you guys want to see from that initial list?
[77:51.75]How do I join?
[77:53.03]Oh, fish select.
[77:56.17]Wait, you can be a stingray?
[77:59.01]Pufferfish?
[78:00.73]I have no coins.
[78:04.77]Are you kidding me?
[78:06.51]Wait a minute.
[78:09.19]What's free?
[78:13.09]This... How did I not get any coins at all from this arrival mode?
[78:28.59]Am I kind of messed up?
[78:39.59]I'm not the brightest.
[78:40.87]I guess I'm dead.
[78:41.77]I thought I could eat it.
[78:46.07]The death match.
[78:46.77]I didn't even need death match.
[78:48.85]It's just attached to me.
[78:54.31]What's the first thing you do when you spawn in?
[78:57.43]Spike myself in the chest.
[79:00.42]Okay.
[79:00.82]Okay.
[79:11.68]Are these real?
[79:12.98]These are not real fishes, right?
[79:15.56]What is this?
[79:22.23]These are cartoon characters.
[79:27.00]Fish don't look like this.
[79:28.12]These are fucking cartoons.
[79:40.41]A fish doesn't look like this.
[79:44.78]Is this like an Easter egg?
[79:46.20]Like, oh look, it's something from Finding Nemo or something.
[80:09.62]Are you dead yet?
[80:20.04]They won't die.
[80:21.60]They won't die.
[80:22.44]Stop smiling at me and die!
[80:38.95]Oh my goodness, why?
[80:47.04]Some deathmatch this turned out to be.
[80:59.95]I've taken all the skin off of its back.
[81:47.60]I guess I can kill you, microscopic plankton.
[81:56.39]I don't know if I'm satisfied with that one.
[82:12.64]Where is everybody?
[82:37.59]Oh, Spongebob!
[82:57.73]He's farming minus twos.
[83:00.59]Yep.
[83:20.09]I'm sitting here thinking.
[83:22.43]They just kind of do the same thing over and over again.
[83:25.25]Just the same thing forever.
[83:29.73]I go, wow, what these things are dumb.
[83:32.83]And then I think about the amount of games of Hearthstone Battlegrounds I've played.
[83:37.53]Where I pick elemental every time.
[83:40.74]And I've done that.
[83:43.22]Hundreds, if not thousands of times.
[83:47.52]But not so different.
[83:48.90]Very alike.
[83:56.24]Alright, well here's my group.
[84:09.68]You should stream it.
[84:10.42]No, I won't.
[84:12.44]Hearthstone Battlegrounds is one of those games where that's a game that it's just for me.
[84:16.50]Because if I stream it, I'll be embarrassed.
[84:20.52]I'll think of every play I did.
[84:21.86]And I'll think of the person making fun of me because they played... They're better than I am at the game and they know way more.
[84:28.19]Okay, I'm back.
[84:33.55]We're back and we're bigger.
[84:54.69]Still won't die.
[85:02.28]0.4 damage.
[85:09.32]Let's leave.
[85:13.66]How is this deathmatch?
[85:16.51]It's me and two of these other bluefish versus the weird clownfish over there.
[85:23.11]And a stingray.
[85:27.18]This is not a death match.
[85:28.48]This is just, we're just hanging out in different spots.
[85:35.09]What's going on over here?
[85:45.20]Ow!
[85:45.36]Get it off!
[85:45.68]Get it off me!
[85:46.06]Get it off!
[85:46.32]Get it off me!
[85:46.68]Get it off!
[85:46.94]Get it off!
[85:47.30]Get it off!
[85:47.52]Get it off!
[85:47.74]Get it off!
[85:47.96]Get it off!
[85:48.18]Get it off!
[85:48.42]Get it off!
[85:48.74]Get it off me!
[85:49.14]Get it off me!
[85:49.48]Get it off me!
[85:49.80]Get it off me!
[85:50.08]Get it off me!
[85:50.42]There are whales!
[85:51.04]Help!
[85:51.72]Help!
[86:23.77]Who is this supposed to be?
[86:30.38]Who's in there?
[86:37.21]They were hiding.
[86:39.29]Alright, new... We're gonna be Bilbo.
[86:45.03]Okay.
[86:45.69]What is this?
[86:46.77]You don't have a gang.
[86:47.55]Yeah, I do.
[86:56.45]Are we piranhas?
[86:59.50]I think we are piranhas.
[87:02.78]I'm not in this gang?
[87:08.31]Why not?
[87:16.53]Are we gonna go swarm something?
[87:27.74]Swarm him!
[87:28.08]Swarm him!
[87:28.42]Help me!
[87:33.54]I was gonna say he eats it like Otto eats dog treats.
[87:42.25]This feels kind of unfair that the gang is just free food.
[87:48.53]One more.
[87:59.75]Alright, that's it.
[88:00.75]I'm done.
[88:01.67]I'm done.
[88:02.05]Like, how are we supposed to fight against tiger sharks?
[88:06.73]How is this fair at all?
[88:08.35]This is not a death match.
[88:09.43]This is bully.
[88:10.83]What?
[88:11.23]How?
[88:11.71]What are we supposed to do about this?
[88:21.64]Who are they going after?
[88:22.50]I need.
[88:26.80]Oh, I got a coin.
[88:27.46]You're right.
[88:43.29]This is cool.
[88:46.17]OK, aren't stingrays like the true neutral of the ocean?
[88:50.05]Like nobody cares, right?
[88:52.25]Stingrays just kind of float around.
[88:53.56]I don't have any coins left.
[89:12.85]I thought that stingrays just kind of floated around and if you just left it... Sharks eat stingrays?
[89:23.10]Don't stingrays just like open their mouths and eat like the dust of the ocean?
[89:28.66]Do crab madness, alright.
[89:35.63]What is that?
[89:36.65]How do I play with that?
[89:50.89]I know I'm breaking the rule.
[89:53.83]The rule is we play these 30 to 40 minutes, maybe one hour tops.
[89:58.27]I got interested.
[89:58.87]I'm sorry.
[90:06.06]Oh, you can do that.
[90:09.30]There it is.
[90:09.76]Whoa.
[90:22.78]There's more, too.
[90:23.86]A Dunklesaurus?
[90:28.26]I want to play with these.
[90:34.70]Oh, really?
[90:35.28]That's cool looking.
[90:48.71]This game was actually pretty fun.
[90:51.11]This game was cool.
[90:57.84]Alright.
[90:58.20]Well, that's cool.
[90:58.92]That was, um, it was feed and grow fish.
[91:02.46]Uh, where are we going from here?
[91:06.09]From here?
[91:06.47]Okay.
[91:06.57]I'm going to give you some options.
[91:11.23]I'm going to decide which one.
[91:12.71]20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[91:15.21]I kind of feel like playing that right now.
[91:16.53]20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[91:20.06]Oh, I could just do this and make like a few thousand people leave maybe.
[91:25.10]I'm going to play 20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[91:26.30]I'm going to get it out of my system.
[91:28.15]And then I'm going to probably have, there's probably like three or 4,000 people are going to leave after that.
[91:32.65]As of what comes after that.
[91:33.81]Alright.
[91:34.53]That was fun.
[91:36.11]Cool.
[91:40.22]That was feed and grow fish.
[91:41.40]That was fun.
[91:42.72]I don't know how, what the stage of development on that game is, but it was fun.
