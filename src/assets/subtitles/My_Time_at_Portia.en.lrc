[00:04.21]How's it going?
[00:06.89]How are you?
[00:10.67]Yeah?
[00:12.11]Good.
[00:15.65]Hope you're doing good.
[00:16.47]Welcome, everybody.
[00:21.66]I'm late?
[00:22.18]Well, I'm actually early.
[00:23.90]By about an hour.
[00:27.00]You're almost at 1 million.
[00:28.02]I know.
[00:28.48]I'm keeping an eye on it.
[00:31.79]I'm keeping a very close eye on that follower count.
[00:41.91]We're going to do some chill stuff today.
[00:44.61]I have some fun stuff to talk about, though.
[00:49.11]Well, I have two... I have a shitty thing to talk about, and then I have a cool thing to talk about.
[00:53.59]What do you want to hear first?
[00:54.66]Good news or bad news?
[01:00.32]Good news or bad news?
[01:03.04]Bad news always first, okay.
[01:07.82]I might have COVID.
[01:11.54]I took a PCR yesterday.
[01:17.80]So, trying to figure out what to do.
[01:20.28]Lock down, hunker down.
[01:22.85]Holly is positive.
[01:24.63]So... I'm still testing negative, but I want to go get a PCR.
[01:30.47]So...
[01:30.95]We're gonna find out in another day or two, because I keep testing negative on the at-home test, but I heard that that is possible, so... But let me just be very clear.
[01:39.91]Seems to be very mild so far.
[01:42.35]She's fine.
[01:43.56]Very mild.
[01:44.62]As well as me.
[01:45.22]I mean, I'm... Obviously, listen to me, right?
[01:46.44]You can hear it.
[01:49.06]I think... I think we're okay.
[01:50.90]I think we're gonna be good.
[01:56.08]So that's the bad news.
[02:01.96]The good news is... No, baseball's not delayed.
[02:05.82]What do you mean?
[02:06.40]Baseball's in a month.
[02:08.14]I'm not delay... Guys, sorry.
[02:10.68]I might have COVID, so baseball in a month is canceled.
[02:15.66]It's not going to happen.
[02:19.53]But no, this is good news.
[02:20.41]You want to hear the good news?
[02:21.23]This is actually really cool.
[02:24.47]I'm going to be playing multiverses in a couple days here.
[02:29.89]Remember that game?
[02:30.91]Remember that game?
[02:32.39]Remember Multiverses?
[02:34.39]And guess what?
[02:35.62]It's gonna be sponsored!
[02:37.94]So, fucking hell yeah!
[02:42.56]That's pretty cool.
[02:45.76]I've been waiting for that game to come back.
[02:48.44]And they reached out, and it's like, alright, fucking yeah, let's go!
[02:56.29]You're going to lose your sponsorship for swearing.
[02:58.81]I'm not sponsored right now.
[02:59.69]I'm not going to swear that much.
[03:01.82]I'll be good.
[03:07.36]Marketing Andy.
[03:10.84]Which game?
[03:11.44]Multiverses.
[03:12.16]Remember the Bugs Bunny game?
[03:15.17]That's coming back.
[03:16.01]And I've been waiting.
[03:18.29]I want to play that game so badly.
[03:21.05]I'm so excited for that game.
[03:30.10]Yeah, I'm 998.
[03:32.34]It's insane.
[03:35.36]If I have COVID, fuck.
[03:38.12]No, I'll be fine.
[03:39.06]I'll be fine.
[03:39.66]I'm gonna be good.
[03:44.24]Trust me, I'll be fine.
[03:47.21]You have to be brand friendly, Andy.
[03:51.11]Honestly, okay.
[03:52.31]I feel like... Let me be very honest with you.
[03:54.93]I feel like I am... I'm pretty brand friendly as it is.
[03:57.61]Don't you think?
[04:00.76]I don't think I'm a brand risk.
[04:02.52]I think it's just, I am just who I am, and that's it.
[04:06.10]I don't think I'd do anything that would be a risk or anything.
[04:10.56]I mean, I say swear words.
[04:13.98]You guys, we are the, yeah, you guys are the brand risk, not me.
[04:19.31]This chat is the brand risk.
[04:21.21]I I can behave during a sponsor segment.
[04:24.05]You guys are the brand risk.
[04:27.33]That's fucking funny.
[04:30.74]You literally, yeah, you're literally weird.
[04:33.16]You're naked.
[04:35.38]No, just listen to me.
[04:38.08]I can be brand friendly.
[04:39.14]I can be very brand friendly.
[04:42.59]I think you guys can too.
[04:44.11]I think we can work together.
[04:56.02]uh the other stream while advertising another stream you spent like 15 minutes advertising a different mobile game what the other stream while advertising another stream you spent 15 minutes advertising a different game no I didn't I was making a comment on um on mobile game ads I never mentioned a game by the way that sponsor segment was well over by then
[05:19.75]I streamed that game for six hours two days ago.
[05:23.09]The sponsor segment was not for six hours.
[05:26.75]I took the ad out of the title and we were just playing.
[05:34.23]I can be brand friendly.
[05:35.83]Whatever.
[05:36.61]Do you know what brand friendly... I got this for you.
[05:41.33]What do I got?
[05:44.72]That's not... All your conversations were not brand friendly before.
[05:48.95]On that whole stream.
[05:52.01]864P Andy.
[05:52.79]Somebody tell him.
[05:58.55]How'd your physical with the bug-eating doctor go?
[06:02.29]It was pretty good.
[06:07.43]But yeah, I'm gonna, I have a mute button here.
[06:09.73]I don't know if I'm gonna be on cam that much this stream, but whatever, we'll see.
[06:13.94]This is probably not gonna be a long stream either, because I was like, I'm ready to go now, and I want to stream.
[06:18.74]It's not that I don't want to stream.
[06:20.46]So,- I want to be live, I want to hang out.
[06:22.88]I'm gonna play my time- is it- is it- is it Portia?
[06:26.53]Port-chia?
[06:27.71]Or Portia?
[06:28.45]What is it?
[06:29.27]How do I pronounce it?
[06:30.23]Spell it phonetically in the chat.
[06:38.87]It's Portia.
[06:39.98]Portia.
[06:40.44]Okay.
[06:40.56]Alright.
[06:42.06]So yeah, you're gonna hear me mute sometimes like this.
[06:49.06]That's for me to kind of clear my throat because I don't want to be gross on stream.
[06:53.88]I will obviously keep everybody updated on how I'm doing over the next few days.
[06:58.53]But as it is right now, I'm still testing negative for it.
[07:02.46]But we'll see.
[07:03.70]I did a PCR, and there is no... I don't know what the false negative rate on that is, but who knows.
[07:11.05]Let's find out.
[07:14.75]Alright, so let's go.
[07:15.31]Let's play.
[07:19.47]I've been hearing this music the whole time.
[07:25.55]I'm sitting here telling you guys that I'm like... I've been exposed to COVID.
[07:30.49]And this is all I hear.
[07:31.59]This is like not the right music.
[07:40.04]Is the baseball stream in trouble?
[07:41.34]No, the baseball stream is perfectly fine.
[07:44.16]That got moved to August 19th.
[07:46.56]So don't worry.
[07:47.26]That's still gone.
[07:51.62]Okay.
[07:53.84]Okay.
[07:56.44]Here we go.
[07:59.42]I have it ready, right?
[08:00.16]Yeah, I do.
[08:03.40]So this game, if you wonder what this game, okay, I wanted just to chill today.
[08:05.82]I didn't want to have like a crazy stream with a bunch of crazy shit going on.
[08:10.48]So this is going to be a chill day.
[08:12.39]You understand?
[08:16.53]If I have boogers coming out of my nose, you need to be, you need to tell me.
[08:18.87]Otherwise, there's no way I'm going to know.
[08:20.03]Is it a controller game?
[08:20.97]Is it a controller game or what?
[08:25.65]What should I do?
[08:26.33]Keyboard and mouse.
[08:26.97]Controller game?
[08:34.76]This is Harvest Moon.
[08:35.84]I mean, it's supposed to be kind of... It's like a Stardew Valley kind of game.
[08:39.80]When's... Oh!
[08:40.71]Oh!
[08:40.93]Thank you for reminding me.
[08:41.65]I'm gonna sneeze.
[08:42.55]No, I'm not.
[08:44.06]Okay, no, I'm fine.
[08:45.46]Let me tell you something about Greenscreen.
[08:46.72]So, Greenscreen Movie Night... I'm gonna address you directly on this.
[08:50.31]Greenscreen Movie Night... I don't have a date for it yet, but... this is the final day... to submit something.
[09:01.30]If you have a video that you want to submit, please go to the Discord and read the rules.
[09:06.64]This is tonight at midnight Pacific.
[09:09.58]It's over.
[09:10.04]We're closing submissions tonight.
[09:13.99]We have already hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions.
[09:18.31]It's going to be a lot to go through them.
[09:20.33]I'm not going through them because I obviously want to stay completely... I want to be in the dark completely on it.
[09:26.24]I have watched, because I couldn't help it, I've watched like four of them.
[09:31.34]And I was laughing my ass off.
[09:34.06]And I was like, stop, don't look at it anymore.
[09:35.98]No more.
[09:37.98]So tonight it's over.
[09:40.68]You're desynced?
[09:43.40]No, I'm not.
[09:46.35]I am not desynced.
[09:49.53]You look pretty pale today.
[09:51.33]Yeah, well, exclamation point, sick.
[09:56.15]What the hell is in your ear?
[09:57.33]What?
[10:00.20]What do you mean?
[10:02.76]Oh, this.
[10:03.40]Okay, it's the earbud.
[10:06.44]You look pretty pink.
[10:08.72]Do I?
[10:10.08]Whatever.
[10:10.40]There's a bug in your ear.
[10:17.51]Your neck looks really bulgy today.
[10:20.15]No, it's because I have a fucking gross beard.
[10:23.19]Alright, so yeah.
[10:24.09]If you have a submission, get it in.
[10:25.71]This is your last day to do it.
[10:30.72]After tonight, we're going to vet all these.
[10:34.10]Probably shave it down a little bit.
[10:35.66]And then, I want to say over the next six or seven days...
[10:40.85]Maybe less, depending on how fast it takes to go through them.
[10:44.35]So you can imagine somewhere in that week of... Let's see here.
[10:50.73]So submissions are done tonight.
[10:53.73]So therefore... You can expect somewhere around maybe this coming weekend, possibly, we'll do it.
[11:03.48]Maybe... If we can get through them, maybe Sunday?
[11:08.26]This next kind of Sunday, this weekend?
[11:11.66]I don't have a hard date for you, though.
[11:12.80]I will have a good date for you in two days.
[11:15.77]So when I stream on Tuesday, I'll give you guys a hard date.
[11:19.05]Because then I can go over with the mods and the community leaders and stuff.
[11:21.79]We can figure out how long it's going to take.
[11:24.19]Did I pass a million?
[11:25.79]You liar!
[11:26.45]I didn't pass a million.
[11:29.86]Tweet that the submissions end tonight.
[11:32.97]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[11:34.83]It's still pretty early.
[11:36.67]Let me tweet this.
[11:37.91]Hold on.
[11:45.54]99875.
[11:46.52]It might happen today.
[11:49.04]It might not.
[11:50.45]It depends.
[11:55.43]I should write... Also... Green screen...
[12:03.01]Technically that's tomorrow, right?
[12:07.18]But like, people get it.
[12:33.50]If you have something, go read the rules in the Discord and maybe... Okay, that's it.
[12:46.67]That's good enough.
[12:54.12]If you have something, go read the rules in the Discord and submit it.
[13:03.23]Is that good?
[13:05.24]Also, green screen movie night submissions end tonight.
[13:07.64]Wait, green screen movie night submissions end tonight.
[13:10.88]That's fine.
[13:11.28]At 12.01 midnight.
[13:13.26]I say night three times.
[13:15.46]Green screen movie night submissions end tonight at 12.01 midnight.
[13:18.56]12... Should I say end at 12.01 midnight?
[13:22.64]That's better.
[13:27.64]End at 12.01 midnight tonight.
[13:30.16]How do I say this without saying fucking three... saying night three times?
[13:40.89]And then a thumbs up.
[13:41.81]That's good.
[13:43.71]Somebody just said, who cares?
[13:46.05]I do.
[13:46.33]This is green screen movie night, man.
[13:55.47]Alright, that's good.
[13:56.52]Tweeting.
[13:59.72]That's good.
[14:04.56]That's 12.01 midnight tonight.
[14:06.18]That makes sense, right?
[14:06.96]That people get it.
[14:12.44]Oh, fuck, I didn't say Pacific.
[14:14.18]Oh, who cares?
[14:15.04]Why can't you edit a tweet?
[14:20.02]Whatever.
[14:20.64]Whatever time zone you're in, it doesn't matter.
[14:22.56]Like, it's just... Just like tonight.
[14:24.92]Look, if you submit it at like 1 o'clock in the morning, I don't care.
[14:28.85]Who cares?
[14:29.29]We'll let it in.
[14:32.55]Don't worry.
[14:33.17]It's gonna be fine.
[14:36.19]You ready to play my time at Portia?
[14:40.41]But yeah, I'm excited about that.
[14:41.39]That should be a lot of fun.
[14:44.94]Okay, you guys ready?
[14:45.62]New game.
[14:47.84]Have my face came in a bad spot?
[14:54.14]Also, nobody... I asked if this was a controller game and everybody ignored me.
[15:00.31]I'll use mouse for now.
[15:05.71]I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[15:08.51]I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[15:11.34]Which one sounds like me?
[15:15.51]Okay, I'll say it and then you guys tell me.
[15:17.25]What the fuck?
[15:22.24]I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[15:24.82]I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[15:26.82]Not one?
[15:27.06]I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[15:29.44]That's close.
[15:29.80]Get out of here.
[15:30.60]No, that's not me.
[15:31.34]Alright, so we're gonna go three.
[15:32.69]Okay, hair.
[15:32.91]How did I spin him?
[15:34.25]Oh, okay.
[15:54.34]Alright, hair length.
[16:04.00]Hair, oh, hair highlight?
[16:11.54]No, no, probably this one.
[16:13.65]Wait, no, this one, but short.
[16:16.61]That's pretty good, right?
[16:21.89]Or is it this one, but shorter?
[16:26.07]This one or the other one?
[16:30.78]Bowl cut.
[16:31.62]Bowl cut or riot.
[16:35.88]This one's fine.
[16:37.00]Yeah, that's what it is.
[16:37.94]Alright, so what is it?
[16:38.86]It's kind of more like this.
[16:45.25]That's pretty close, right?
[16:48.27]That's close enough.
[16:50.97]Like that?
[16:52.13]Yeah, that's close enough.
[16:53.83]Make it look greasy looking.
[16:58.56]Marco.
[16:59.44]My name is... I don't want it to be me, though.
[17:01.48]Alright, I want it to be... I don't know.
[17:12.03]Craig.
[17:12.83]No, not Craig.
[17:14.89]Joshua.

[17:18.01]Jerry's easy.
[17:18.65]Okay, now FaceType.
[17:50.66]Upper face?
[17:51.54]Wait, I can do this?
[18:05.25]This doesn't look like me at all.
[18:06.35]It's like not even fucking close.
[18:23.96]That's pretty close.
[18:26.52]Lower face?
[18:33.19]This looks like Mark Zuckerberg.
[18:51.95]Okay.
[18:53.90]Do I really care that much about this, honestly?
[19:14.97]Jesus.
[19:21.94]I'm just that guy from Homescapes.
[19:26.89]You know that mobile game?
[19:31.25]Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna stick with this.
[19:42.20]Yeah, we're staying with this.
[19:45.54]Okay, is that good?
[19:51.04]Do the longer mustache?
[19:53.22]No, no, no, no.

[20:07.21]I get to pick my birthday?
[20:09.05]Okay.
[20:14.89]What month is this?
[20:17.97]Day one, month two.
[20:20.71]Where's the month?
[20:21.83]Wait.
[20:25.09]There are only four months in a year?
[20:26.69]Wait, what?
[20:28.99]There's only four months.
[20:34.17]They don't even have my birthday.
[20:37.53]Okay.

[21:20.10]That's the easiest dumb thing.
[21:27.14]Okay, here we go.
[21:35.58]We're about to land at Portia.
[21:37.74]Yeah.
[21:49.02]Alright So now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play controller did I keep asking this question I
[22:18.00]Should I use the controller?
[22:18.80]I've asked it three times, but I just don't look after five seconds.
[22:21.42]Because it takes about ten seconds for the delay to go through, and I just forget.
[22:25.46]Is this how I use the controller?
[22:28.50]Controller?
[22:30.06]Alright.
[22:31.08]Yeah.
[22:31.30]Alright, here we go.
[22:32.74]We're just chilling today.
[22:47.29]Alright.
[22:48.32]Turn up the volume?
[22:49.30]Is it low for you?
[22:50.54]Is that better?
[23:03.21]No one's been working there since your pa left Portia so many years ago.
[23:06.89]Is this Pokémon?
[23:08.09]No, it's not Pokémon.
[23:09.15]This is my time at Portia.
[23:11.43]Yeah.
[23:12.15]This game's apparently very good, so hold your judgments now.
[23:16.90]Hold your judgments right now.
[23:22.42]Alright, dash is R1.
[23:25.20]Plus R1, okay.
[23:26.72]Jump is circle.
[23:27.44]Okay.
[23:31.70]and here we are your workshop get the battleaxe this place sure has seen some wear and tear what do you think looks homely now it's too loud well blame that guy that said to turn it up presented to you when you've seen this house okay so I got a letter
[23:57.13]Jerry, when you read this letter, I will already be on the other side of the world.
[24:02.32]I'm sorry about that.
[24:03.78]I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be.
[24:06.76]This was all so sudden.
[24:08.50]So I didn't have much time to tell you or figure out how to take care of you.
[24:11.90]Then I thought about this workshop.
[24:13.64]It might not look like much now, but I will brace you for the wind and cover you from the rain.
[24:18.56]I've left my workshop handbook that details how I created things in my workshop.

[33:02.05]Why would I do that?
[33:03.05]That'd be stupid.

[35:14.25]Look at the top left.
[35:15.15]You can craft items on your work.
[35:16.47]Yeah, I know, but I need stone first.
[35:21.28]Don't fuck around.
[35:23.08]It's by the house.
[35:23.94]What?
[35:33.24]It's probably close to the town.
[35:34.64]Yeah, that's what I figured, but it's not there.
[35:38.25]Is he playing Breath of the Wild?
[35:39.55]No.
[35:39.91]This is my time at Portia.
[35:41.93]And it's a chill game for a chill day because I might have COVID.
[35:45.83]So I'm just trying to relax.
[35:49.20]It's possible.
[35:53.10]This isn't even my house.
[35:55.36]Whose fucking house is this?
[35:56.94]Where's my map?
[36:01.30]Where's my house?
[36:02.91]How do I see the map?
[36:10.80]M. What is that on the controller?
[36:12.20]Is this my house?
[36:18.36]Where's my house?
[36:20.94]Okay.
[36:22.56]There we go.

[37:13.44]How do I put it down?
[37:14.42]How do I put it down?
[37:14.92]They don't want to kill me.
[37:17.53]I just aggroed the whole farm.
[37:18.91]They're like, yeah, don't ever do that again.
[37:22.23]Get out of here.
[37:24.37]Okay.
[37:26.99]I'm gonna keep going.
[37:33.57]Alright, here's my house.
[37:39.74]I still don't have enough stone.
[37:41.18]I have to go to bed soon.
[37:42.82]Alright, let's see.

[37:53.67]Okay.
[37:54.17]Where's a quarry?
[37:58.21]You're failing the tutorial.
[38:00.21]Where?
[38:00.49]Where?
[38:01.05]There's no rocks anywhere.
[38:02.24]There's herbs and spices.
[38:19.03]Fishing spot.
[38:19.71]Should I go up to, like, the... Go to town?
[38:29.34]Flower shop?
[38:32.40]Where are the other cookies?
[38:33.62]Your inventory is full right now.
[38:37.79]In the ruins.
[38:39.07]Yeah, but I could just go to a quarry, too.
[38:40.53]I don't want to go all the way to the ruins.
[38:44.44]Like, I don't want to, like, okay.
[38:47.50]Fine, whatever.
[38:50.08]I'll go there tomorrow morning.

[39:25.93]How do I put it down?
[39:26.67]Okay.
[39:27.85]That's fine.
[39:30.81]Homescapes.
[39:37.66]Alright, I did.
[39:42.78]Do I have a chest I can put stuff away in?
[39:47.68]Okay.

[40:07.31]Chilling and leveling.
[40:08.09]That's what I want to see.
[40:10.05]These weren't here before.
[40:10.87]Look at these.
[40:12.65]These literally were not here.
[40:14.21]I swear to God, I would have seen them.
[40:19.16]Alright, I can do the axe.
[40:20.84]Axe and pickaxe.
[40:24.80]He's got delirium.
[40:26.49]I'm fine.
[40:27.11]Alright, this is from the town hall.
[40:30.03]Hello, new builder.
[40:30.75]We'd like to remind you that Portia currently has two authorized ruins for you to dive in.
[40:35.27]An abandoned ruin number one below the Church of the Light and the hazardous ruin in the collapsed wasteland east of town.
[40:41.61]I didn't have this info before.
[40:44.01]You guys get it?
[40:45.09]Come on.
[40:45.43]Alright, how do I put stuff?
[40:47.58]I need to make some shit here.
[40:51.90]Alright.
[40:52.80]Simple axe.
[40:53.38]I need one more stone.
[41:00.04]This was not here yesterday.
[41:06.66]Okay.
[41:07.72]Can I... How do I expand my inventory?
[41:09.22]Can I look and see what I have in my inventory?
[41:12.16]Well, on the controller?
[41:12.74]Because I want to play with controller.
[41:17.80]This dude's hallucinating.
[41:20.73]Alright, let's make this at least... Okay, simple axe.
[41:26.19]One.
[41:28.31]Alright.
[41:30.04]So now, where's my inventory?
[41:31.38]I need to wake up.
[41:38.60]Now I need a simple axe, and I need a pickaxe.
[41:43.18]There we go.
[41:45.10]I have the first builder test is complete.
[41:48.25]Now, who do I turn this into?
[41:49.19]This... The fuck?

[41:54.15]Oh, they're working out.
[41:54.95]Cool.
[41:55.19]Can I do this too?
[41:55.73]What's over here?
[42:08.07]Hey.
[42:08.23]Okay.

[42:35.82]Alright.
[42:36.32]Pass the test.
[42:37.16]Stone furnace time.
[42:39.56]Should I talk to people?
[42:41.52]Sister of the Church of the Light.
[42:42.88]Goodbye.
[42:43.12]Who are you?
[42:44.87]Emily.
[42:45.65]Next door neighbor.
[43:07.77]Okay.
[43:12.91]Let's chat.
[43:16.43]Pumpkin pie?
[43:17.17]Oh, cool!
[43:20.74]I forgot, this is... We're in like a rural town.
[43:24.16]I'm thinking neighbor.
[43:25.20]Oh, cool, neighbor.
[43:27.54]You might be six miles down the road.
[43:30.16]Alright, what do I need for this?
[43:37.19]Welcome to my workshop, handbook's first page.
[43:40.17]I'm gonna try to write down all the knowledge that I'm going to gain as I tackle this workshop business.
[43:45.09]Since I'm probably the... False alarm.
[43:54.50]Only one who's gonna read this, hello.
[43:56.00]To me, handsome guy.
[43:57.10]Haha, okay.
[44:00.60]Go up to the assembly station podium, open up this handbook and select a diagram.
[44:07.40]Once the framework of the item appears, I can start placing the different parts.
[44:10.78]To install a part, I need to have the part in my hands.
[44:13.42]Alright, cool.
[44:14.30]So let's do it.
[44:15.78]Item catalog.
[44:18.12]Stone furnace.
[44:22.70]Stones... Alright, what kind of fucking book is this?
[44:27.93]Just write instructions.
[44:29.61]Why did you do a bunch of weird drawings and place it like a Microsoft Word document?
[44:34.05]Like, just write, hey, this is what you do and this is what it looks like on the other side.
[44:38.15]Alright.
[44:38.73]With... With relevant part equipped, aim at the silhouette of the construct and press A or X. Okay.
[44:46.62]Assembly station console can be used to view material requirements, right?
[44:51.40]Parts can be installed.
[44:52.22]Yeah, yeah.
[44:52.86]Overcovered.
[44:53.32]Yeah, we all know how to do that.
[44:54.52]Alright, we get it.

[46:34.06]Endurance...
[46:37.00]I gotta be careful, though.
[46:37.80]I don't want to go all the way down this tree and get to the end of the discipline tree that the priest had in Classic WoW and literally have a worthless talent tree.
[46:46.90]What was that thing all the way at the end?
[46:48.68]All the way at the end of the discipline priest tree?
[46:51.56]It was like, give, uh, somebody 20% more, uh, no, it was make all spells for casted target 20% reduced mana cost.
[47:02.95]It was like, what a fucking piece of shit.
[47:06.58]What was it called?
[47:07.08]What was that move called?
[47:10.60]Power Infusion.
[47:11.62]Yeah.
[47:12.02]That spell sucked absolute balls.
[47:14.94]It was terrible.
[47:16.72]And it was the last spell at the end of the Discipline Tree.
[47:23.15]You su- Hey, come on.
[47:26.79]It's good.
[47:27.65]Yeah.
[47:28.13]In, like, 2020, wow.
[47:30.43]In, like, 2005, wow.
[47:33.35]That move was- What the fuck are you even gonna give that to?
[47:35.45]It was terrible.
[47:39.48]I think I'm going to do gathering.
[47:47.33]Stamina cost decreases by 25% when using the axe.
[47:51.91]Tree kicking and harvesting activities.
[47:54.08]Alright.
[47:55.16]I'm going to be harvesting Andy.
[47:59.18]Let's go with the axe.
[48:00.74]Nice.
[48:02.90]Okay.
[48:03.08]So I got to use the axe now.
[48:05.57]This is cool.
[48:06.13]Alright.
[48:06.43]Missions.
[48:08.44]Very cool.
[48:08.94]Alright, inventory.
[48:11.67]Uh, let's get this shit out of the way.
[48:15.25]So, I gotta use my axe for shit.
[48:16.77]And it's an attack, too.
[48:17.97]It hurts.
[48:22.75]What should I do with this?
[48:24.63]I can convert this into money?
[48:28.01]Alright.
[48:28.81]So, that's good so far.
[48:30.35]Maybe an apple to eat it?
[48:31.60]Maybe I get some whatever?
[48:32.88]I just saw what I looked like.
[48:35.20]Alright, this is good.
[48:38.62]Okay.
[48:39.72]I've got the axe now.
[48:41.66]You get a little window thing here.
[48:45.68]Alright.
[48:46.16]So now I need some more... I need wood.
[48:47.80]Let's go cut some trees down.
[48:49.47]And I need a little bit more stone.
[48:50.51]This seems fun, man!
[48:59.83]What?
[49:01.55]I need a better axe?
[49:03.43]Okay.
[49:05.61]There we go.
[49:05.87]I can cut this down.
[49:16.23]Cool.
[49:17.67]Do these... do they actually have durability?
[49:27.56]No, it's good forever.
[49:28.32]Alright.
[49:29.08]This I... this... okay, now I'm... now we're working.
[49:30.84]Now we're... now we're going.
[49:34.41]Stop deforesting the land to make your white bread factory.
[49:43.40]You know what's kind of crazy?
[49:44.56]I can't... Alright, what you said is so funny because... We don't need any more white bread factories, right?
[49:54.25]Think about that.
[49:55.75]There's really not a need for that at all.
[49:57.65]Zero need for it.
[50:06.52]There are so many different brands of white bread.
[50:10.50]That... Why would you ever make a white bread company?
[50:14.85]Even a bread company.
[50:16.35]Especially white bread.
[50:19.21]Yeah, I got an idea.
[50:20.17]I'm going to get into the white bread business.
[50:22.93]Dude, I would probably highly suggest you don't.
[50:28.44]No, I can't do that yet.
[50:30.06]How much did I get?
[50:38.46]Do I have enough?
[50:43.32]You look like you'd eat white bread with olives on it.
[50:46.80]I like white bread.
[50:47.94]I do.
[50:48.92]I'm not going to be one of these people that sits here and tells you, oh, white bread is disgusting.
[50:53.16]Gross.
[50:54.32]I like whole wheat bread.
[50:55.72]Oh, stop.
[50:57.86]White toast is incredible.
[50:59.96]White toast is very good.
[51:02.31]So is wheat toast.
[51:03.47]So is rye bread.
[51:04.71]Why do we have to be so weird about this?
[51:11.35]It's like, okay, you know when you go to a breakfast place, and for some reason people that order, when they order a breakfast, people get weird when they do this.
[51:19.88]So you sit there, it's like, oh, what do you want?
[51:21.34]I'll take the hash and eggs, and okay, and I'll take an orange juice.
[51:24.62]Oh, what kind of toast would you like?
[51:26.54]And it's almost like they close the book, they close the restaurant menu, and they kind of puff their chest up, and they're like, rye bread, please.
[51:35.47]Oh, you're getting rye bread this time.
[51:40.70]And then when I order white bread, it's like... Okay.
[51:45.98]White bread.
[51:46.46]What are you, fucking 12?
[52:00.47]No one does this?
[52:02.96]Yeah, I know people do this because I do this.
[52:06.26]I have ordered at a breakfast place, and when they have all the bread options, I'm just like, uh, you know, how about a nice sourdough?
[52:13.20]Even though I don't fucking care.
[52:14.29]And then the sourdough comes out, and I'm like, I don't even fucking want that.
[52:17.79]I just wanted people to think I was, like, not, like, 12, because I order white bread every time.
[52:32.30]I eat it.
[52:32.84]Don't act like I don't eat it.
[52:37.31]Do you have taste buds?
[52:40.13]Yeah, exactly.
[52:41.21]You're the exact person that is a white bread hater.
[52:45.03]And when somebody orders a white bread at a restaurant, you internally, even if you don't say it, you go, I order wheat bread.
[52:52.88]You do.
[52:53.50]You're definitely the person that does that.
[52:59.02]I have to be holding it.
[52:59.90]Okay.
[53:09.85]I don't like that you have to be holding the item.
[53:14.31]Okay.
[53:17.23]Ten wood.
[53:18.49]And then I need some stone.
[53:20.03]Alright, I need another... You need to be... I have it, right?
[53:24.00]Stone stool.
[53:25.12]How do you make a stone stool?
[53:34.02]Oh, storage.
[53:35.68]Yeah, give me this one.
[53:37.82]Stone storage.
[53:38.62]Stone stool.
[53:39.10]Stone stool.
[53:40.76]Okay, I just need a bunch of stone.
[53:43.10]Where should I put this?
[53:45.02]People can't steal, right?
[53:50.39]There we go, alright.
[53:54.43]Uh, fast exchange?
[53:55.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:59.05]I'll probably need this for something eventually.
[54:01.61]Tree sap, yeah.
[54:02.91]Plant fiber, I'm definitely gonna need this for something.
[54:05.54]But for now, let's keep it like this.
[54:06.52]Alright, cool.
[54:08.16]So I need to get more stone.
[54:14.29]Why do people hate white bread?
[54:15.65]I don't think people hate it.
[54:16.47]I think it got a really bad rap because people started to realize that white bread is the same in your body as cotton candy, essentially.
[54:23.64]So people just kind of treat it like shit because your body just doesn't really do anything with it.
[54:29.60]But, you know, whatever.
[54:30.28]Alright, give me some stones.
[54:41.25]White bread is kind of like cake.
[54:43.07]That's fake news.
[54:44.53]No, it's not.
[54:45.01]It's not.
[54:45.53]Can somebody clarify if that's fake news?
[54:48.43]Your body thinks that white bread is just sugar, essentially, is all it thinks, right?
[54:56.66]Yeah.
[54:58.98]I mean, it still has some qualities to it, but your body kind of treats it the same way, doesn't it?
[55:04.24]It's just straight-up carbohydrates.
[55:05.94]It's all it is.
[55:06.36]It's nothing else.
[55:11.19]That's all bread, though.
[55:12.43]No, but, like, whole wheat bread has, you know, fiber in it.
[55:15.41]It's got... It's got, like, vitamins and shit.
[55:17.49]Like, whole wheat bread is much better for you.
[55:19.77]Right?
[55:22.83]Multigrain... They all actually... They have, like, some material... Get on the road.
[55:30.60]Get on the road.
[55:31.24]What are you doing?
[55:34.30]This guy's driving in circles.
[55:36.18]Are you alright?
[55:38.80]I thought they were sleeping!
[55:39.94]I saw the s- I thought it was Zees.
[55:41.44]Hey!
[55:59.33]I can actually walk faster than this bus is driving.
[56:04.58]This guy's not even on the road.
[56:05.70]Alright, you're a fucking weirdo.
[56:06.72]Alright, I need rocks.
[56:08.89]I gotta go to bed, too.
[56:09.83]Stones, quick!
[56:13.03]Where are the stones?
[56:13.71]I need, uh... I need stones.
[56:29.88]Play Elder Scrolls VI.
[56:31.22]It's not out yet.
[56:38.38]Would you ever eat a gallon of mayonnaise for money?
[56:40.54]No, why would I do that?
[56:41.62]I don't want to ruin mayo for myself.
[56:45.82]There is lots of things that I refuse to eat or drink because I don't want it to ruin a thing that I like.
[56:53.02]Case in point, I will never put alcohol into orange juice.
[56:57.24]I know that, oh yeah, make it a screwdriver.
[56:59.30]Vodka and orange juice.
[57:00.16]No thanks.
[57:00.66]No.
[57:01.32]Because then it'll make my brain think the taste of orange juice is gross.
[57:06.43]I love orange juice and I'm not going to ruin it.
[57:16.94]Because I know that I'll be like, oh yeah, vodka and orange juice, vodka and orange juice, that tastes a certain way.
[57:22.02]But then I'll get up the next morning and be like... And I'll reach for the orange juice, because that's what I do.
[57:29.00]And I'll be like, oh no, no, no, no, no.
[57:34.97]What about mimosas?
[57:35.79]No, no thanks.
[57:37.97]I don't like drinking in the morning.
[57:41.73]People do it, but I don't fucking know why or how.
[57:46.23]Let's drink a bunch of mimosas at like 10 o'clock in the morning.
[57:48.75]No.
[57:51.19]No, I don't want to do that.
[57:53.30]That's too much.
[57:57.44]Okay, I need some more rocks.
[58:02.56]Yeah, mimosas, they taste good.
[58:04.14]They're fine, but I don't want to drink at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[58:09.12]I don't like Bloody Marys either for that same exact reason.
[58:11.04]It's like an 11 o'clock in the morning drink.
[58:15.50]No thanks.
[58:19.51]Alright, stone stool.
[58:22.19]Let's go.
[58:22.93]Got it.

[58:43.46]Alright, now what?
[58:44.98]Can I call this guy on the phone?
[58:46.22]Do I have to go keep talking to this guy?
[58:49.53]I don't have a cell phone number at this point.

[71:29.45]Something about talking to the church.
[71:30.92]Oh, it's a disk.
[71:31.96]It's data discs.
[71:34.90]Okay.
[71:35.62]That's where you find them.
[71:39.02]There's another one down here.
[71:48.35]Is it only data discs?
[71:53.83]I'm not going to get trapped down here.
[71:56.17]Ooh, power stone and old parts.
[71:59.25]How much stamina do I have?
[72:05.98]I'm gonna try to make it over here.
[72:08.76]Can I just mark them all?
[72:10.42]Alright, I gotta mark one at a time.
[72:12.08]This one's closer.
[72:22.76]Oh, there's a stone in here!
[72:31.99]We have to turn discs into monsters.
[72:33.90]Hey, isn't there a new Monster Rancher coming out?
[72:37.54]Oh, I got a relic.
[72:38.58]Alright, I'm almost out of energy.
[72:46.46]There's one more right here.
[72:49.50]There is, yeah.
[73:01.31]I'm back.
[73:09.26]Another relic?
[73:09.74]Okay, for those of you that are wondering, I have a button that I can press if I need to, like, sneeze or, like, cough or make a gross sound so you won't hear it and you won't see it.
[73:27.35]Alright, I'm almost out of energy, so I don't want to get stuck down here.
[73:34.46]Stop picking your nose?
[73:35.24]I'm not!
[73:40.84]Alright, I got a bunch of cool stuff.
[73:43.78]Oh, I can open the map and return to the end.
[73:45.22]Alright, that's fine.
[73:48.18]That's pretty cool.
[73:48.70]Alright, so I have a research center.
[73:53.74]Alright, I got a lot of stuff to do.
[74:03.98]I kind of want the... I'd really like to have the jetpack now.
[74:10.67]Alright, head over there.
[74:14.24]I got enough stone.
[74:15.18]If I make the furnace... What's that, a pig?
[74:27.25]I like this game.
[74:28.43]This game's pretty fun.
[74:30.63]Wait, we have a quest.
[74:31.21]Hey!
[74:33.44]The farmer.
[74:34.02]Okay.
[74:34.30]Okay.
[74:56.23]Should I do it?
[74:58.71]Yeah, why not?
[74:59.09]Welcome to the round table.
[75:00.01]Chef's choice.
[75:28.33]Ooh, cheap soda.
[75:31.39]Apricot juice.
[75:33.25]Should I get a plate?
[75:35.01]Rainbow lemonade.
[75:36.23]Defense.
[75:36.59]Alright, let's get the attack one.
[75:38.55]How do I not have enough... Oh.
[75:39.22]What happened to all my money?
[75:43.30]Didn't I have 95 or 97 dollars?
[75:47.88]I don't get it.
[75:53.06]And Sir Gideon Offner.
[75:56.17]The all-knowing.
[75:59.72]Did I get robbed?
[76:00.58]Why did I lose all that money?
[76:01.91]What did I buy?
[76:04.03]You spent... Oh, that's right.
[76:05.25]It was 80 bucks for the week.
[76:06.65]Okay.
[76:06.87]Alright, let me go to... Who do I need to turn this into?
[76:12.13]One of these people?
[76:16.05]Okay, I gotta... You have a turn in here.
[76:20.45]You have a turn in here.
[76:21.33]Let's go.
[76:39.59]Never mind.
[76:41.29]I don't have anything I want to give you that I want to part with.
[76:44.45]I'm busy.
[76:44.97]Go ask Petra.
[76:46.43]I just tried to talk to Petra.
[76:48.05]What do we have here?
[76:50.46]Data disk.
[76:51.96]Do you say data or data?
[76:53.80]I say data.
[76:55.04]You know what it is?
[76:56.41]Data?
[76:56.51]No, it's data.
[76:56.93]Wait, so are we like a thousand years in the future?
[77:15.83]I don't... I don't think I'd want to play these.
[77:17.97]Do you know how... Okay, do you know how many of these exist?
[77:21.18]That are just a shitty playlist from, like, 1999?
[77:22.32]Like, eight tracks on it?
[77:23.22]They're gonna... They're gonna find these, and they're just gonna find...
[77:44.30]It's gonna be like, oh yeah, what's on this one?
[77:46.04]They're gonna play it, and it's gonna be a burnt copy of... Like, Sum 41.
[77:51.97]Their studio album, their debut album.
[77:55.55]Ah, it's another Sum 41 album.
[77:57.05]Okay.
[77:58.47]Put it in the list.
[77:59.25]Put it in the pile over there.
[78:02.44]Hoobastank, yeah.
[78:10.94]Weezer.
[78:17.83]And some of them will be like, oh, what's on this one?
[78:20.01]And they'll put it in, and it'll just be nothing.
[78:23.13]And they'll realize, oh, this person fucked up this disk.
[78:26.70]It says there's some data on it, but we can't even get it.
[78:29.06]Like, they probably screwed up the burn process.
[78:34.56]I remember burning CDs, and it was just... Sometimes it would just mess up, I wouldn't do it right, and I would have to do it like four or five times to finally get the thing I wanted.
[78:44.09]And it's just like, what the hell?
[78:49.27]When rewritables came out, that was a big deal because you could go over everything.
[78:57.45]Bring them to you.
[78:58.29]Wait, so I can bring data disks to you or I can bring them to the church.
[79:16.71]Ah, this must be a piece of a relic.
[79:18.91]You can use our recovery machine in the research center to restore it to its original shape.
[79:23.32]Okay.
[79:27.06]Data disks.
[79:28.22]Stop saying data disks.
[79:35.46]It's data.
[79:36.10]There's data on here.
[79:38.30]Good day, builder.
[79:40.20]Oh, dear.
[79:41.38]Didn't I already hand it in?
[79:42.50]Age of Corruption.
[79:43.10]Okay.
[79:43.24]Okay.
[80:02.86]You're what?
[80:05.20]18?
[80:05.22]19?
[80:05.92]The Age of Darkness is probably just another fairy tale story to you, right?
[80:10.60]When I was young, my great-grandma shared her first-hand account of the time before Peach.
[80:15.96]The time when folks lived in ruins underground.
[80:19.30]The Dark Age of Technology?
[80:21.27]Everybody fought each other over the most basic of things.
[80:24.49]And people were considered old if they had to live to 30.
[80:27.89]And it was always, always dark.
[80:32.07]Wait, what is what what is this?
[80:34.11]But what are we doing imagine that because that's what the end of the world That situation was created by the very same sort of dark technologies stored inside this little disk.
[80:44.96]Oh
[80:47.46]Anyhow, I'm not trying to scare you, but it's the reality of your builder business.
[80:53.32]Dangerous technologies are spread all over the world, waiting to be stumbled upon and rediscovered.
[80:59.47]Places like the Research Center and cities like Vega 5 expedite the recovery.
[81:05.23]Calamity will strike again.
[81:07.28]Mark my words.
[81:08.98]So, it's a priority of the church to seek out and destroy all the data pieces and the dangerous relics.
[81:14.30]Destroy them?
[81:14.56]Alright, so we gotta pick a side.
[81:16.16]They help from ruin divers, such as yourself, of course.
[81:18.98]Yeah, do we want to collect all the Hoopastank burnt CDs, or do we want to destroy them?
[81:24.92]So I can give this to you.
[81:26.32]Yes, yes, that's right.
[81:28.02]The church will reward you handsomely for your efforts.
[81:31.56]Destroy?
[81:31.80]What kind of green technology?
[81:54.79]Special seeds?
[81:56.24]Destroy them.
[81:56.86]Don't trust the church.
[81:58.10]I don't know.
[81:58.86]Yeah, destroy them.
[81:59.86]I think I want to keep them.
[82:02.36]Alright, how to farm.
[82:03.14]Yeah, alright, alright.
[82:04.46]Okay, so now I've got to make a choice here.

[95:45.27]I'm gonna go up.
[95:48.87]Whoa!
[95:51.00]What is this?
[95:51.42]I just found this.
[95:59.00]Alright, this is cool.
[95:59.72]Alright, now over here.
[96:05.71]They're in... Alright, there's one over that way.
[96:10.23]Secret tunnel.
[96:10.73]Yeah, let's go.
[96:17.14]Your face is blocking some stuff.
[96:18.84]No, it's not.
[96:20.68]Not anymore.
[96:25.78]Termo, you should... I'm not doing any of that.
[96:29.80]Alright, what's this?
[96:33.36]Something good.
[96:33.88]I hope.
[96:39.97]What is it?
[96:41.01]It's a jewel.
[96:43.26]Just one dated?
[96:44.84]Is it eyeglass?
[96:47.02]What a piece of shit.
[96:49.36]Oh, hold on.
[96:52.60]We're going this way.
[97:07.93]I have so much.
[97:08.61]I need to make like ten of those things.
[97:12.03]The smelters.
[97:14.39]Alright, it's a... Old parts, data disk, and power stone.
[97:17.54]Alright, I got the old parts.
[97:18.76]I now need to figure out where to get the... The wooden planks, whatever it is.
[97:27.47]I've still got time.
[97:27.99]This is what I'm doing today, so I'm just gonna go.
[97:31.77]Play power stone?
[97:32.53]I already did, and I beat the game.
[97:33.91]And it was a fucking breeze.
[97:42.29]Why don't they remake that game?
[97:43.65]Honest to God.
[97:45.93]That's one of the coolest IPS that Capcom has.
[97:48.56]Is there a sofa down here?
[97:51.76]What?
[97:52.02]This is the couch down here.
[97:53.14]Alright.
[98:08.41]They are?
[98:08.87]I would love to see a Power Stone remake.
[98:12.95]Or even a remaster.
[98:17.31]New relic.
[98:17.88]Old thermos piece.
[98:19.40]Cool.
[98:22.16]Anything else I can do before... Oh, over here.
[98:29.51]I definitely need to make it like three or four of those smelters at least.
[98:35.80]How much, uh... I got enough.
[98:41.28]Another data disk.
[98:43.27]When are we gonna start killing stuff?
[98:44.69]Uh, probably fairly soon, I would imagine.
[98:49.87]Strange lenses.
[98:52.30]Oh, I have both eyeglass pieces.
[98:54.20]Can I make glasses?
[98:57.42]That'd be actually kind of cool.
[99:00.12]Uh... I'm gonna keep going this way.
[99:15.21]I need more soil.
[99:17.79]I've ever seen a UFO.
[99:19.67]No.
[99:22.73]Although sometimes, you know, when you hear a plane go over at night, everybody kind of all, everybody does the same thing.
[99:29.61]You just kind of go, oh, it's just a plane.
[99:32.08]Thank God.
[99:32.80]It's not aliens.
[99:34.98]Horse piece.
[99:44.72]You never hear a plane go over and it sounds different or a little closer than normal.
[99:49.76]Or a helicopter or something and you just sit there and you go, what was that?
[99:52.76]Holy shit.
[99:53.28]Okay, never mind.
[99:55.50]Come on.
[99:58.48]More parts.
[99:59.16]I think I gotta get out of here now.
[100:05.22]I'll go up.
[100:16.65]Don't ever dig straight up, but whatever.
[100:18.87]It's a different game.
[100:19.64]There's no lava.
[100:37.24]Monument Model Piece 2.
[100:38.24]That means there's a Monument Model Piece 1.
[100:40.15]Alright, this is the last one and I'm done.
[100:43.13]I promise.
[100:45.79]I have a lot of stamina.
[100:47.11]I'm fine.
[100:58.20]Ooh, copper.
[100:59.66]And... A small engine.
[101:06.43]It's right here.
[101:08.49]I gotta get my money's worth.
[101:09.27]I paid $80 to come in here.
[101:17.05]Good.
[101:17.51]Any more?
[101:20.77]There's a few more.
[101:21.67]I can get them.
[101:31.19]You paid $80?
[101:32.05]No, I didn't.
[101:32.83]The game wasn't $80.
[101:33.47]Ooh, horse piece.
[101:46.35]Do I have the whole horse?
[101:51.35]I'm still okay on stamina.
[101:55.71]Weird glass jar.
[101:56.97]31.
[102:11.33]Alright, 10 more swings and I'm out of here.
[102:21.55]What's that?
[102:21.93]There's a secret one over here.
[102:23.09]Alright, I don't care.
[102:23.63]I'm getting it.
[102:24.31]I don't care if I die down here.
[102:35.52]It's a purple!
[102:36.20]I need to go down here.
[102:39.42]Come on, 15.
[102:43.25]What the fuck?
[102:45.73]What is this?
[102:50.12]I only have seven more swings.
[102:52.10]What is down here?
[102:55.41]Shit.
[102:56.43]Can I drink anything?
[103:01.67]Abandoned room?
[103:07.69]What?
[103:07.99]I have four stamina.
[103:16.79]Can I eat anything?
[103:24.56]Oh, come on.
[103:25.66]This just got way cooler.
[103:31.34]Fuck.
[103:36.93]I have four stamina.
[103:39.21]I'm gonna die.
[103:42.07]I gotta leave.
[103:42.67]How do I get out?
[103:43.23]Quickly.
[103:45.25]Eat the sand?
[103:54.64]sand, guys.
[103:58.96]Will this stay here?
[103:59.70]I gotta get out.
[104:05.21]Okay.
[104:06.01]Open the map then press... Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[104:10.87]I gotta mark where this is.
[104:11.99]It's right here.
[104:12.57]Okay, get out.
[104:19.09]You can't eat sand.
[104:19.99]I have one stamina point.
[104:22.95]Shit, I wanna go down there.
[104:27.87]That was cool.
[104:29.43]That was so cool.
[104:36.57]Alright, I gotta go to bed.
[104:38.70]Where am I right now?
[104:39.34]Alright, so just bang a right and go straight.
[104:48.14]That was cool.
[104:56.33]Happy... Can I, like, drink something?
[104:58.39]Happy Apartments.
[104:59.27]No, I don't care.
[105:04.37]I gotta get out of here.
[105:04.91]I have to get out of here.
[105:06.41]There's a chest right there.
[105:25.24]Alright.
[105:27.85]Get me out!
[105:31.28]Get me out of the town!
[105:32.52]I have one stamina point left.
[105:37.00]Get me out of here!
[105:37.68]There it is.
[105:40.90]Alright, go.
[105:41.44]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[105:42.40]Back home.
[105:42.80]Sleep.
[105:44.88]I don't think you lose stamina unless you do anything.
[105:47.32]So, you don't just lose it over time.
[105:49.76]That's good.
[105:57.86]Okay, I'm going back down there.
[106:01.28]This guy's pretty sick.
[106:06.75]Alright, I'm going back down.
[106:07.61]Let me store some of this shit.
[106:12.23]Oh, I have the new sofa.
[106:12.93]That's right.
[106:21.81]Let me put the sofa down.
[106:30.43]Sofa?
[106:30.83]It is a sofa.
[106:35.99]It's kind of beat up, though.
[106:40.69]Cool.
[106:43.80]Oh, I can invite my friends over.
[106:44.82]We can hang out on the sofa.
[106:45.76]This house sucks.
[106:53.62]It's getting there.
[107:00.01]What?
[107:00.35]Imagine the smell.
[107:01.79]What?
[107:02.05]Imagine the smell.
[107:02.83]There's not even a trash can in this house.
[107:05.21]That doesn't work here.
[107:06.05]Imagine the smell.
[107:07.45]You understand that?
[107:10.29]That makes no sense.
[107:12.80]There's just wood and a sofa on the ground.
[107:16.72]Okay.
[107:17.28]So now I need the wooden planks.
[107:22.60]Ah, shit.
[107:23.10]Shit.
[107:30.34]So I'm assuming the bottom will show you what you can do with it.
[107:34.36]Should I hold on to some of this stuff?
[107:35.55]I think I should, right?
[107:42.59]I need another one of these.
[107:43.37]Okay, I need another storage unit.
[107:53.01]Wooden basket.
[107:53.94]No, where is it?
[107:54.62]Wooden storage.
[107:56.32]I'm going to make a couple of these.
[108:05.62]Alright, I'm going to have one of them be for raw materials, right?
[108:12.14]One of them for junk, and one of them for, like, relics.
[108:17.57]I get it.
[108:18.09]I'm starting to get this game.
[108:21.01]Okay, let me pull up this stuff.
[108:25.57]Okay, this is going to... Okay, the one on the right is going to be for raw materials.
[108:28.72]Okay.
[108:30.32]Copper, stone, you know, grinding stones, soil, stone, yeah, whatever, right?
[108:35.51]Poop.
[108:40.43]And then the second one's going to be for relics.
[108:45.49]Yeah.
[108:47.79]I think so.
[108:48.91]Okay.
[108:50.43]So this is going to be just stuff that I find in the dungeon.
[108:55.92]Okay.
[108:56.38]Okay.
[108:58.87]Bring them to the research facility.
[109:01.13]I will eventually.
[109:01.79]I want to go back down there.
[109:04.31]And this is going to be for... Planting an... An organic material.
[109:20.24]Okay.
[109:21.98]Good.
[109:22.86]Sort.
[109:24.94]Hey, there we go.
[109:27.17]I don't even really need this, but I'm just going to put it away.
[109:29.33]Alright.
[109:31.47]So now I need to build some stuff.
[109:40.23]No, I'm going back.
[109:41.31]I'm going back into that thing.
[109:42.81]Yep, let's go.
[109:46.40]Minecraft Andy.
[109:51.18]Oh, wait, I can make a sword.
[109:52.44]That's a good idea.
[109:57.22]That's right.
[109:57.74]That's true.
[109:58.12]What does it take to make a sword?
[110:04.23]I think it's three copper bars.
[110:07.41]Practice sword?
[110:08.69]Spiked practice sword?
[110:10.33]No.
[110:12.37]Bronze pickaxe?
[110:13.23]How do I make a copper sword?
[110:18.62]Upgrade the work table at A&G Construction.
[110:24.39]Okay.
[110:25.61]So I have to go upgrade the table?
[110:28.83]At A-N-G construction.
[110:30.49]Alright, I can do that too.
[110:40.58]Bring food this time too.
[110:43.86]I'm just one track mind Andy.
[110:45.58]I'm going in.
[110:46.97]I don't need to... No.
[110:48.11]Yeah, I'm just going in.
[110:49.05]Fuck it.
[110:49.31]I'm one track Andy.
[110:53.25]I already bought this place for a week.
[111:01.42]You have skill points?
[111:06.12]You're going to die to the slugs.
[111:07.32]I'm not going to die to the slugs.
[111:08.42]I'm going to dodge roll.
[111:12.67]Okay, so that's where I want to go.
[111:17.75]Who dug this?
[111:31.45]Where's... Where is it?
[111:34.37]Where's my, um... There it is.
[111:40.82]Okay.
[111:47.20]So what is in this... What's down here?
[111:48.82]Oh, I dug like a real weirdo.
[111:57.88]Weird...
[112:03.03]What did I do?
[112:03.95]Why did I do it like this?
[112:05.01]This is the wrong hole.
[112:15.15]Is it?
[112:15.41]It's up...
[112:36.18]Where was this?
[112:38.54]It's marked on the map.
[112:41.54]How come I can't see with the radar?
[112:47.99]Yeah, it was the purple one, but it's not on the map anymore.
[112:53.72]You were going the right way.
[113:05.17]No, yeah, okay, let's sit here.
[113:07.92]Alright, here we go.
[113:08.70]Let's do it.
[113:17.66]So should I fight this stuff?
[113:18.56]Alright, what's dodge?
[113:20.10]L1.
[113:25.41]What's on me?
[113:27.03]Okay.
[113:35.68]Is that poison?
[113:36.26]I don't know what that is.
[113:37.98]How come there's no sound effects?
[113:56.00]Alright, we're good.
[113:58.86]Wait, I can take all this furniture?
[114:00.62]Ow!
[114:10.84]I'm at range, right?
[114:12.56]It can't hit me.
[114:16.20]Good.
[114:17.40]I'm getting a ton of experience.
[114:18.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[114:19.04]I gotta level up.
[114:19.54]I have to level up.
[114:24.68]Should I have more points in gathering or fighting?
[114:30.24]What should I do?
[114:34.08]More experience?
[114:36.80]That's a good one, I think.
[114:37.86]Yeah.
[114:40.83]10% more EXP gained.
[114:44.21]And... Okay, I got a lot of this other stuff.
[114:52.72]Just stay at range and I'll be fine.
[114:58.34]Please put the gloves on?
[115:01.88]I stored the gloves.
[115:03.33]There's a Chester Trust over here.
[115:05.27]Chester Trust, there it is.
[115:06.19]Silver.
[115:06.51]Silver.
[115:11.70]What about all this stuff?
[115:12.46]Can I take any of this?
[115:13.64]What is this?
[115:16.88]Cool.
[115:21.33]Two discs.
[115:21.81]Uh-oh.
[115:43.93]Small silicon chip!
[115:47.21]That was what was in here.
[115:48.29]This is cool, though.
[115:49.01]You just find random little dungeons.
[115:53.77]Do the sound effects.
[115:56.49]I think that's all that's in here.
[115:57.57]Is there anything else I can do?
[116:01.51]This is cool, though.
[116:06.09]Stop blinking out of existence.
[116:10.77]Dude, you gotta stop doing those bong hits.
[116:24.80]The dungeons get bigger.
[116:25.76]I feel like this game's really fun.
[116:30.22]I would imagine it's probably really fun.
[116:32.28]That's cool.
[116:33.54]There's just random dungeons you can find.
[116:35.88]So now that I've done this already, should I just kind of move on from it?
[116:40.57]I mean, I'm already here.
[116:41.45]Might as well keep looking.
[116:51.04]Why are you crying?
[116:53.64]Because...
[116:57.28]There are two in this cave?
[116:59.98]Interesting.
[117:00.48]For those of you that are trickling in, yeah, I might have COVID.
[117:09.91]It's a very high possibility.
[117:13.42]But I'm still feeling fine.
[117:14.62]I'm still feeling okay to stream.
[117:17.54]So that's what I'm hearing.
[117:18.38]I just wanted to play something chill and easy.
[117:20.16]Let's hang out.
[117:26.70]Okay.
[117:28.22]Let's take another look.
[117:33.26]I don't see anything else over here.
[117:34.44]I'm just going to keep going this way.
[117:40.38]Should I just pick a direction and just go?
[117:50.37]There's no way the base... No, the baseball stream has moved a month.
[117:53.11]Don't worry.
[117:58.68]You should go down.
[117:59.44]Okay.
[118:01.02]Whoa.
[118:01.74]This is a new floor.
[118:03.84]I can't break this.
[118:05.94]Can I?
[118:06.34]Am I doing... Am I damaging this?
[118:07.58]Dude, I'm just getting experience for hitting this.
[118:15.53]Look at how much experience points I'm getting for this.
[118:18.73]I'm getting 150 EXP a swing.
[118:23.17]Oh, it's like that with everything.
[118:24.27]Never mind.
[118:34.33]Error's already at that one.
[118:35.77]I'll get this one.
[118:42.09]Is this another sofa?
[118:43.03]No.
[118:45.93]Rusty pipe.
[119:00.34]I need a better pickaxe.
[119:04.30]Can I just sell these?
[119:05.14]I don't want four pink couches.
[119:14.81]Let's go up here.
[119:26.77]It's similar to... This is kind of like an Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley combined.
[119:29.83]That's what it feels like.
[119:30.46]I feel like there's a lot to do so far.
[119:34.84]It's cute.
[119:35.18]I like it.
[119:36.74]What's that?
[119:39.36]A small clock.
[119:45.71]I haven't even done any of the farming yet.
[119:54.34]Oh, horse piece.
[119:55.82]I think I have the whole horse.
[119:56.88]Can I combine it?
[119:57.40]I'm going to bring this up to the research center.
[120:04.59]Alright, there ain't nothing else.
[120:05.47]Wait, yes there is.
[120:08.92]Alright, I'll get two more things and I'm going to go up.
[120:21.48]It is a good game.
[120:22.52]Yeah, it feels like it's fun.
[120:28.34]But I'll tell you, we're going to have... It's going to be an intense stream on Tuesday.
[120:32.74]I thought it said Old Turkey.
[120:39.14]I'm going to be playing Multiversus.
[120:41.22]And you bet your ass that I'm ready to play that one.
[120:46.13]Also, that's going to be sponsored too, so that's fucking awesome.
[120:49.92]I'm so ready to play that game.
[120:54.38]It's going to be a perfect world there.
[120:59.10]I've been waiting for that to come back out.
[121:03.52]So you better be ready.
[121:04.26]Tuesday is going to be a gamer session.
[121:06.22]It's going to be a true gaming session.
[121:09.91]And you know what?
[121:10.33]I'll be honest.
[121:10.81]I feel like I was pretty good at that game.
[121:12.23]I feel like I was doing pretty well.
[121:13.17]I think I only lost like two or three rounds.
[121:15.35]I think I did really well.
[121:17.29]I think that's my game.
[121:24.49]I was doing good.
[121:25.49]I really was.
[121:26.13]Genuinely.
[121:34.38]I wonder if they... Is there any new characters?
[121:36.12]I wonder if they're going to announce any characters or anything.
[121:38.86]I don't know.
[121:39.28]I don't want another couch.
[121:51.79]I've got five couches.
[122:11.43]Yeah, that game does something that I'm so happy that they're doing.
[122:16.46]And, like, if you need me to pull up a resource for this, I will.
[122:21.10]I talked about it before.
[122:22.58]And I'm gonna talk about it again.
[122:24.06]Right now, before we play it again.
[122:27.02]Fighting games like that, that have tons of moves and combos and shit on the screen...
[122:33.39]The new Smash Bros.
[122:34.44]games, the last two new Smash Bros.
[122:36.82]games, it's just every single swing is this explosion of smoke and particle effects, and it's like hard to even see what the fuck's going on.
[122:49.42]Every time I've tried to play Smash Bros., it's just like I'll do like a punch to somebody, and it's just this purple fucking smoke explosion.
[122:58.31]And it's just annoying to look at.
[122:59.87]It's hard to even see.
[123:04.97]I don't mind particle effects, but man, the new Smash Brothers game dialed it up to a million.
[123:15.42]Those are boomer words?
[123:16.34]No, they really aren't.
[123:19.10]I don't think they really are.
[123:20.14]Does anybody agree with me on this?
[123:22.30]I feel like a lot of you do.
[123:38.52]There's a lot of visual information.
[123:40.35]It's just too much.
[123:41.61]Does every single move in Smash Brothers have to create big, huge, explosive purple smoke?
[123:46.57]That's my question.
[123:48.61]Every single move.
[123:49.49]Does every move have to have big, purple, explosive smoke?
[123:54.03]Every single move in the game.
[123:57.03]I'm about to fucking educate a lot of people here.
[124:20.87]Let's take a look.
[124:27.43]I want to go over this because this is important.
[124:37.33]Is it just like a match with no commentary?
[124:41.06]Not no gameplay, no commentary.
[124:42.72]Hold on.
[124:44.20]Smash Brothers.
[124:45.34]I'm looking at YouTube.
[124:46.42]Smash Brothers.
[124:47.24]No gameplay, no commentary.
[124:49.20]So what the fuck are you talking about?
[124:51.22]It would just be the menu?
[124:52.98]No gameplay.
[125:01.77]I gotta find one.
[125:02.45]Alright, here we go.
[125:06.49]This is Ultimate, right?
[125:10.54]We're going to go over this because I can be a fucking boomer with this.
[125:13.78]That's fine.
[125:18.99]But it makes it hard to play the game for me.
[125:20.65]It just kind of annoys me.
[125:33.25]Make sure it's at HD.
[125:34.42]Alright, so.
[125:36.48]Let's go frame by frame here.
[125:40.95]This is just a random YouTube video of Smash Bros.
[125:43.95]Ultimate gameplay.
[125:52.00]Okay, so.
[125:53.62]Let's take a look.
[125:57.26]Look, okay, somebody just swung.
[125:58.52]And look what's going on over here.
[126:03.66]Do you see that?
[126:06.46]Like, why does this have to happen every time somebody gets hit?
[126:11.60]Look at that.
[126:14.31]Everybody has to have all the smoke flying across them.
[126:21.95]How do I do each frame?
[126:23.23]Frame by frame.
[126:27.50]Was it forward?
[126:28.36]Was it like K or something?
[126:29.56]How do I do a frame?
[126:33.48]Comma and period.
[126:37.56]That didn't work.
[126:41.63]Why is that not working either?
[126:46.97]Hold on.
[126:52.25]Ready?
[126:53.27]It's too much.
[126:55.69]And they started doing this for the Wii U. Every move has to have explosive smoke and particle effects to take up both two characters.
[127:11.94]Somebody gets just punched once.
[127:14.94]It's so much visual data.
[127:24.52]And I understand, like, some of it needs to exist.
[127:26.24]But if you compare it... Let me compare that to multiverses.
[127:29.18]There's not this much.
[127:31.89]Change the playback speed.
[127:41.80]You see the smoke?
[127:46.70]True, true, true.
[127:48.30]A lot of you disagree with me.
[127:50.22]I know a lot of you don't agree with this.
[127:53.19]But, like, this right here, I don't even know who did a move to somebody.
[127:59.21]Like, all these, like, boom, boom, boom, flare, flare, flare, flare!
[128:04.18]And then all this other shit, like the blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing!
[128:11.93]Old man yelling at clouds.
[128:14.74]Like, what happened here?
[128:15.62]It's okay.
[128:22.84]Whatever.
[128:25.74]That's okay.
[128:28.28]Do a poll.
[128:30.76]Now, I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me because they like Nintendo.
[128:35.56]Right?
[128:35.92]Like, I have to automatically be wrong with a lot of people because it's a Nintendo game.
[128:47.75]Like, I don't even know who did a move.
[128:58.32]Hey, by the way, I love the Smash Brothers franchise.
[129:02.08]Do you like bright colors and smoke?
[129:10.74]Do you like bright colors and smoke?
[129:22.75]I'm actually very... Please say honestly.
[129:25.73]Speak honestly.
[129:28.15]Don't... Just a streamer just told you something.
[129:30.05]Don't do it.
[129:30.83]I want to hear... I want to know what you really feel.
[129:32.23]How do you really feel about that?
[129:34.76]How do you feel about that?
[129:35.60]How do you truly feel about that?
[129:50.98]It's messy.
[129:51.56]I think it is.
[129:54.20]What's the I don't care option?
[129:55.44]Yeah, you can do the I don't... Wait, what?
[129:57.72]Oh, I gotta leave.
[130:00.76]You need effects for info.
[130:01.96]Yeah, you need effects for info, but they... It's just they... Ever since they... I don't know what game it was.
[130:07.08]It was maybe Brawl or after Brawl.
[130:10.50]I don't remember it being that crazy where you would do a move and like the whole screen would flash with like five different colors.
[130:21.59]I actually have to get out of here.
[130:29.60]You're just older?
[130:30.52]No, I'm definitely not.
[130:31.80]What do they say?
[130:34.16]You can't turn them off, no.
[130:35.73]What's the consensus on this?
[130:38.19]I want to see how out of touch I am with reality here.
[130:50.22]The new Mario Kart games have this problem too.
[130:53.47]What happened?
[130:54.47]What happened?
[130:55.33]I just fell over.
[130:56.81]Oh, I'm... Alright, whatever.
[130:57.81]60... Alright, so that's not... I don't think that's unanimous though.
[131:15.03]That's kind of a majority.
[131:17.56]That's a majority, but not by very much.
[131:19.38]That's a kind of.
[131:23.26]Do I lose money from falling asleep?
[131:25.68]Hardly.
[131:30.60]Important announcement tonight.
[131:32.44]Oh, okay.
[131:33.69]19 o'clock.
[131:35.17]I'll be there.
[131:35.51]67 is pretty big.
[131:43.97]And, again, don't get me wrong.
[131:45.24]I played... Alright, old parts.
[131:49.20]I played the new Smash game and I thought it was good.
[131:51.44]I just... Just can't get over it.
[131:54.20]I can't get over this new... Maybe I am an old guy, but I'll tell you.
[131:59.08]This new wave of there has to be seven different colors exploding on the screen whenever you do anything.
[132:06.32]This is a new thing in the last, like, five to ten years.
[132:09.62]Call me an old fuck.
[132:10.83]Go for it.
[132:13.60]Go ahead.
[132:14.73]Tell me.
[132:15.93]Go ahead.
[132:16.51]I'm an old man.
[132:17.09]That's fine.
[132:26.96]Alright, I got it.
[132:27.96]So I have a grinder now.
[132:28.76]Where should I put it?
[132:37.18]But, okay, the whole... People are going, wow, who is he talking to?
[132:40.76]Who is he talking to?
[132:42.03]The whole reason why I went off on that is because... Multiverses does not have all that crazy shit all over the screen every time you do anything.
[132:52.67]It's there, but it's not there to an extreme extent like it is in the new Smash game.
[132:56.69]And that's why I was like, wow, I actually kind of want to play this.
[132:59.20]Yeah, is it petty and weird?
[133:00.74]Sure, but that's why I like the game a little more.
[133:03.10]I'm just telling you the way that I feel.
[133:05.20]You can think I'm a weirdo.
[133:06.24]That's fine.
[133:09.28]That's fine.
[133:09.78]You can call me weird.
[133:15.13]Who is he talking to?
[133:16.45]See?
[133:16.85]Somebody said it.
[133:18.93]Jerma, the sponsor isn't today.
[133:21.01]I'm just... I said this a month ago when I played it.
[133:30.00]Alright, so now I have the grinder.
[133:33.44]Now I can do... Okay, here we go.
[133:38.98]Copper blades.
[133:39.56]Okay, I need power here.
[133:43.72]Alright, I need to make three copper blades.
[133:48.34]So I need some more of these, okay?
[133:52.72]Copper bar, let's refuel.
[133:54.18]Okay.
[134:04.12]Old fuck Andy.
[134:05.02]Okay.
[134:10.80]Alright, let me go to the research center.
[134:11.94]I have a lot of stuff that I can probably bring over there.
[134:18.60]They're gonna add that shit after release.
[134:20.00]No, they're not.
[134:20.68]Why would they?
[134:21.18]I probably pissed off a lot of people.
[134:26.24]But what do you want me to say?
[134:27.39]I can't, like, pretend like I can get over it.
[134:29.61]Alright, let me put the sofas in the house.
[134:45.05]They're gonna add effects.
[134:46.71]Can you imagine?
[134:47.21]They just added a bunch of effects after the release of the game.
[134:50.99]That'd be so stupid.
[134:58.03]How many of these do I have?
[134:59.31]I think I'm selling these.
[135:05.35]I don't think I'm... You know what I mean?
[135:06.93]I'm... Whatever.
[135:09.31]I'm getting out of here.
[135:17.77]You're barely into your 30s, but you have takes from a 60-year-old.
[135:21.17]What?
[135:21.49]That's... Come on.
[135:25.79]Okay.
[135:26.45]So now I need to make... What?
[135:28.85]I need, like, a sword, right?
[135:33.11]Uh... Okay, I gotta go to A&G Construction and the Research Place.
[135:41.16]Let me pull out all the things that I can bring to the Research Center.
[135:46.14]No...
[135:47.93]Okay, here we go.
[135:53.69]Bring all the relics.
[135:58.79]Okay.
[136:00.58]Alright, I got a shitload of relics.
[136:02.40]Let's go to the research center.
[136:12.58]Is the research center in town here?
[136:14.00]Is...
[136:20.88]There it is.
[136:21.88]Okay.
[136:23.82]Research center.
[136:27.87]We get bad booger noises?
[136:29.11]I'm alright.
[136:32.73]Dermot hates colors.
[136:34.49]Because you only remember when things were black and white.
[136:37.46]No.
[136:38.10]I know there's a bunch of people right now that are watching the stream and they're going, I get you, man.
[136:44.08]I get it.
[136:46.62]Hey, me and my boys said the same thing.
[136:53.58]Who do I turn this into?
[136:54.32]Oh, it's up here.
[137:09.09]No, this is not a Zoomer versus Boomer thing!
[137:11.23]I got a lot of shit for you to look at.
[137:22.23]I have a lot of other stuff.
[137:23.55]Hold on.
[137:24.50]I'm just going to the fucking register.
[137:25.90]Training dummy, weapon rack.
[137:27.68]Ooh.
[137:27.84]Ooh.
[137:53.60]Chipset?
[137:54.40]Wait.
[137:57.94]Can I... Wait.
[138:00.44]Recover?
[138:02.54]Oh, shit.
[138:02.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[138:07.59]I need one... I need an old thermos piece, too.
[138:12.09]I'm still missing galloping horse pieces.
[138:15.77]Come on.
[138:18.57]Really?
[138:18.87]Really?
[138:20.76]I-I don't- I can't make any of these stupid things.
[138:23.24]Ugh.
[138:31.07]Million- not a million.
[138:32.91]I'm only 500 followers away from a million followers.
[138:39.72]Is it gonna happen?
[138:42.42]Is it gonna happen today?
[138:43.20]500 followers away.
[138:47.99]Oh my god!
[138:49.91]Only 500 followers away to a million!
[139:01.99]That's crazy though.
[139:03.77]Actually crazy.
[139:04.33]Okay.
[139:05.17]How many people unfollowed me from the Nintendo rant though?
[139:08.38]Are we still on pace for today?
[139:21.33]Alright, you want a new fishing rod.
[139:34.88]It's gonna happen.
[139:36.66]Okay, it's like boiling water.
[139:37.86]I don't want to look at it.
[139:38.70]It won't happen.
[139:42.00]Flower shop.
[139:42.58]What was I... Okay, I need to build a bridge.
[139:45.73]Make copper blades and wait a day.
[139:48.65]Let me do the blades part.
[139:52.35]Yeah, let me do blades.
[139:57.74]I can turn that in.
[140:03.54]Bake a cake to celebrate.
[140:04.64]Do a baking a cake stream.
[140:05.90]Should I bake a cake for a minute?
[140:09.60]That's kind of, no.
[140:19.41]Refresh, it's there.
[140:22.32]I don't see it.
[140:28.67]Okay, copper blades.
[140:29.73]I need copper bars.
[140:34.11]Um... I need to make another one of these.
[140:38.83]I need to make, like, two more of those.
[140:44.67]Furnace.
[140:45.01]Okay, I want to make a stone furnace.
[140:49.45]I need ten wood.
[140:50.17]I have to get it in my inventory.
[140:52.25]Right, alright, alright, alright.
[140:57.08]Move all this crap out of the way.
[140:58.36]Okay.
[141:04.04]I need the wood.
[141:06.76]I'm out of wood.
[141:07.20]I gotta go get some trees cut down.
[141:13.69]Stone stool, wood.
[141:15.23]I only have eight.
[141:16.85]Alright, I need a stone stool.
[141:22.05]I need three... Two more stone stools.
[141:24.51]I can make 28 of these.
[141:25.63]I'll make three.
[141:27.91]I'll make four.
[141:28.53]Yeah.
[141:29.39]Okay.
[141:30.79]Stone stool.
[141:34.12]Did I do it?
[141:35.06]No, I didn't.
[141:36.40]I'm not... Did I do it?
[141:39.94]That's not there.
[141:41.78]Is it actually there?
[141:45.95]Refresh.
[141:51.95]No, it's 9956.
[141:53.87]It's not there yet.
[142:05.62]I will say that's actually kind of a big deal, though, because... I'll explain why if I hit it today.
[142:17.14]I need... I just gotta go cut trees down.
[142:31.90]I'll give a speech, don't worry.
[142:33.70]You'll get a big speech.
[142:35.26]I promise.
[142:45.13]Close enough.
[142:46.13]No, I have to actually hit it.
[143:14.06]Alright, wood.
[143:14.74]No, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[143:23.82]I'm keeping an eye on it, don't worry.
[143:28.72]Stone stool.
[143:30.62]And what's the last part?
[143:37.92]Alright, done.
[143:40.65]Pick that up.
[143:43.28]Again, make another one.
[143:50.73]Pick it up.
[143:53.81]Do it again.
[143:54.27]Because I'm not going to wait the whole day.
[143:57.29]I want to be able to grind this out, right?
[144:07.60]Alright.
[144:08.70]Now, I'm placing... I'm going to move some of this shit around.
[144:13.37]This is not a bad spot.
[144:14.41]Let me move this.
[144:18.63]The grinder can go right over here.
[144:22.11]And then these are going to go over here.
[144:23.81]I've got three more of these.
[144:29.98]One, two, three.
[144:31.94]One.
[144:33.56]Two.
[144:36.45]Uh...
[144:47.42]Three.
[144:48.92]Okay, I got my line now.
[144:52.65]So now I've got to... I need a bunch more wood.
[144:58.63]Just keep getting wood.
[144:59.61]This is a grind day.
[145:08.04]Is this technically a tree?
[145:11.24]Fibers, okay.
[145:13.24]Fiber's good.
[145:20.17]Give him points.
[145:22.73]Vape on stream for a million.
[145:26.01]No.
[145:28.05]I could probably kill these.
[145:28.81]Yeah, let's kill some of these things.
[145:30.95]I was afraid of them before.
[145:31.81]Let's see if I can kill them.
[145:41.71]I kind of feel bad.
[145:42.40]I got animal bones and worn fur.
[145:48.98]I kind of feel bad.
[145:57.96]Alright.
[145:58.84]I gotta... How many copper... How many copper do I have?
[146:01.34]I need a little bit more wood.
[146:03.48]Because I'm gonna let... I'm gonna make like 50 iron copper bars overnight.
[146:11.51]I want 100 copper bars.
[146:24.54]Oh, I missed the, like, important meeting, right?
[146:26.76]No, it's going on right now, isn't it?
[146:37.97]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[146:38.63]I'm there.
[146:38.89]I'm here, I'm here.
[146:42.92]I'm 30 minutes late to this meeting.
[146:44.08]Come on.
[146:44.42]Yes, I made it.
[146:48.34]We've been having lots of pan-bat sightings recently.
[146:52.26]I know they're cute, but still, don't go near them.
[146:55.36]They're dangerous.
[146:57.02]I've asked the Civil Corps to try something to scare them off, but I'm not holding up much hope.
[147:03.74]We all know what a pan-bat infestation's like.
[147:07.05]Sometimes I wish we had a tank.
[147:10.01]In other news, we've decided to proceed with the building of a bridge to Amber Island.
[147:15.11]A builder has already been picked for this project.
[147:18.87]Also, we are in preparations for the construction of the DD transportation system.
[147:24.88]I'll be securing the funding over the coming weeks and pick a builder soon.
[147:28.84]Any donations are welcome.
[147:31.24]DD!
[147:31.36]DD!
[147:32.90]DD!
[147:33.92]What?
[147:34.88]How come I didn't hear about the bridge?
[147:36.75]When was this?
[147:48.77]I thought people liked cartoons in this chat.
[147:50.79]What happened?
[147:51.95]Where'd you guys come from?
[147:55.82]I thought you guys liked cartoons.
[147:57.30]Aren't you guys cartoon enjoyers?
[148:04.34]He stopped doing the Kubrick stare.
[148:07.54]Did he?
[148:11.55]That's from Dexter's lab.
[148:13.01]What?
[148:18.00]In Dexter's lap.
[148:23.12]I thought you guys liked cartoons.
[148:25.78]Oh, now I finally get to fish there.
[148:29.33]He's asking for money again.
[148:31.97]Finally, we have a new builder in town this week who lives in the old workshop outside the city gate.
[148:37.87]What are you doing?
[148:38.73]Let us all give a warm welcome.
[148:44.12]By the way, we're all being very, very nice and cordial to him because he's holding an axe at the meeting.
[148:48.43]Okay.
[148:50.11]Yeah, everyone be nice.
[148:52.59]He's got an axe in his hand and he has an I'll kill you mustache.
[149:12.13]What's his name again?
[149:12.69]Jerry!
[149:13.13]There he is!
[149:24.09]Alright, I gotta make one more Copper Blade.
[149:27.69]But I do have to meet people.
[149:28.54]I don't want to meet everybody.
[149:31.02]You're that new person!
[149:33.78]You just inherited that workshop outside of town, right?
[149:38.16]Sorry, where are my manners?
[149:40.84]I'm Sonya!
[149:43.90]Okay.
[149:46.72]Nice to meet you.
[149:55.41]Oh, hi.
[149:56.61]Okay, plus 10 relationship status.

[151:06.03]Oh!

[151:11.77]Do I actually have to time it?
[151:12.77]Plus, I'm doing $50.
[151:22.92]That's worth something?
[151:39.04]It was 50 gold.
[151:40.10]It's not like it was 5,000.
[151:42.89]I'm about to make all that money with all my fucking copper.
[151:45.77]Bah!
[151:46.55]Emporium.
[151:48.17]Just wait.
[151:53.21]Do I just have to meet all these people?
[151:56.19]No, I don't.
[151:56.79]I don't care.
[151:57.35]I'm waiting today.
[151:57.97]I'm making the copper blades.
[151:58.93]I'm making my copper shit.
[152:03.27]I have a lot of copper.
[152:05.78]Get away from my house.
[152:08.60]Get away from my house.
[152:11.28]Where are you?
[152:54.71]Fuck.
[153:07.34]I can't.
[153:08.14]We're gonna get timed out here.
[153:20.68]You took a dollar from me?
[153:21.80]Okay, whatever.

[153:48.24]Don't I have a bunch of copper?
[153:49.24]I thought I had like a hundred.
[153:53.76]There we go.
[153:55.86]Alright, so this one we're going to get going.

[154:27.66]Stop saying it.
[154:43.51]Can I actually sell these, though?
[154:53.94]Where did I get this?
[154:56.52]I can sell these for $50 each.
[154:58.50]Give me all of them.
[154:59.20]I don't want any of these.
[154:59.98]I don't want any of these.
[155:06.53]I'll keep one.
[155:19.96]Sell the bed?
[155:20.74]I'm not selling the bed.
[155:22.02]I'm not gonna sleep on that just random pink sofa.
[155:25.90]Okay, talk with Merlin.
[155:28.08]Make another copper blade.
[155:37.08]There we go.
[155:37.48]Look at this fucking delicious Hershey's chocolate bar.
[155:42.18]Okay, now I gotta make copper blade.
[155:46.45]Nope.
[155:50.92]Uh, okay.
[155:51.68]I still have fuel.
[155:54.43]Just make one more.
[155:56.39]Turn this in.
[156:02.67]Come on, hurry up.
[156:07.73]I need to make some new weapons.
[156:09.71]Enhanced practice sword.
[156:10.91]I mean... I feel like I should just... I could make one of these.
[156:21.26]Wood and hardwood?
[156:22.34]That's easy, right?
[156:24.31]Hershey's is disgusting.
[156:25.97]I mean, it's okay.
[156:40.02]Cadbury's better?
[156:40.73]I mean, that's obvious, yeah.
[156:55.95]You know, the old Wonka bars were the best.
[156:58.97]Before they went out of business.
[157:03.28]Okay.
[157:04.68]So now I'm gonna go talk to that guy.
[157:07.24]I don't care.
[157:15.05]Five wooden boards.
[157:16.17]Yeah, sure.
[157:18.91]Alright, where's this guy?
[157:28.63]We're gonna go here.
[157:30.85]Maybe I'll make some money.
[157:31.53]I'm gonna sell these couches, too.
[157:42.18]What happened to Wonka?
[157:43.64]They went out of business.
[157:45.16]They sold off all their IP.
[157:47.04]The only thing that still exists from Wonka is nerds.
[157:50.70]Whoever they... Whatever company bought them.
[157:52.45]Whoever owns nerds.
[157:54.21]Purchased the company.
[157:55.69]Liquidated everything and kept nerds around.
[158:00.16]Okay.
[158:00.38]What'd I just get?
[158:01.24]Alright, that's a hundred- that's two hundred bucks!
[158:04.33]I just made two hundred plus dollars.
[158:05.71]That was perfect.
[158:06.23]Alright, cool.
[158:06.49]Talk with Merlin.
[158:07.75]Where is Merlin?
[158:26.03]is this for oh right where's merlin at the research center right oh cool two points harvesting activities
[158:56.34]Hmm.
[159:00.12]Or dodge rolls are better.
[159:01.14]I think I'm just going to experience.
[159:08.10]Okay.
[159:09.10]I got a lot of random shit going on here.
[159:10.44]Okay, I got hardwood.
[159:13.46]Let's go.
[159:15.21]Go turn 200 into 10k.
[159:17.17]I'm not going to go slot machine.
[159:18.73]No.
[159:23.51]Okay.
[159:24.13]Let's go turn this in.
[159:27.77]I'll talk to you guys after I get out.
[159:34.05]Gambling now.
[159:35.99]No!
[159:38.97]Ancient AI?
[159:39.37]Wonka was just Nestle, man.
[159:40.19]You were duped.
[159:40.75]But the Wonka bars were good.
[159:59.06]These glasses alter the spectrum of light passing through.
[160:02.16]I think they were used to fix colorblindness.
[160:04.10]Original Wonka chocolate bars.
[160:07.20]They were delicious.
[160:11.46]Okay.
[160:14.02]It's not something we can easily make today, that's for sure.
[160:17.40]Well, they're useless to me, so you can have them back.
[160:20.12]What's a good donut?
[160:20.86]I haven't had a good donut in a long time.
[160:23.32]You can take the glasses to him.
[160:26.47]What's a good donut?
[160:28.23]What's your guys' favorite donut?
[160:34.37]Chocolate glazed?
[160:35.79]Dunkin' Donuts used to do this thing, and I think they still do, but I haven't had one in a long time.
[160:40.27]They used to do this, the cream-filled ones.
[160:43.49]I was such a disgusting kid.
[160:46.79]There was a chocolate cream, like almost like, it wasn't frosting though, it was a mousse almost.
[160:52.69]It was a Dunkin' Donuts chocolate cream filled donut.
[160:55.82]And it was this weird in-between of frosting and mousse.
[160:59.40]I think they still have them, but holy shit, they would... No, not a Boston Cream.
[161:02.22]Actually, I'm not a big fan of those.
[161:04.18]Chocolate cream filled.
[161:06.02]And I used to, seriously, I would just take it and put my mouth on the end where, like, the hole was.
[161:10.50]Because it was, like, a little dollop was on the end.
[161:12.42]It was a donut, fat, kind of squishy donut.
[161:15.77]And inside was a bunch of chocolate cream.
[161:18.62]And I used to sit there and just like, I would suck it up, and then I would just bite into the donut where the filling was and just drain it.
[161:29.52]I was like a vampire to this donut.
[161:37.14]I also, I was one of those kids that only ate the frosting part of the cupcakes.
[161:42.04]It's like, why would I eat the other part?
[161:44.24]It was fucking worthless to me.
[161:45.89]Why would I eat that part?
[161:49.22]Guys, the bottom of the cupcake may as well have been made out of wood.
[161:54.94]It was part of the thing that held the cupcake.
[162:02.24]Okay, so can I turn this stuff in now?
[162:03.86]No, I don't have enough.
[162:10.03]So what did that do for me?
[162:11.09]Give the glasses to somebody.
[162:14.11]I didn't pay any attention to that.
[162:17.79]Who do I need to give these glasses to?
[162:25.36]You wiped the frosting off.
[162:26.92]I was one of those kids that wiped the frosting off.
[162:30.30]You did?
[162:30.78]Really?
[162:31.38]So you like just the cake?
[162:34.17]The donut.
[162:35.07]I mean, the cupcake cake.
[162:39.81]Interesting.
[162:42.85]See, I hated the cake part.
[162:44.23]I still do.
[162:44.87]Okay, Sanwa.
[162:51.70]Sanwa.
[162:54.32]Where's Sanwa?
[163:01.38]I gotta go here too.
[163:02.04]Alright, let me go here first.
[163:08.30]Both of you are weird for that.
[163:09.34]I don't think so.
[163:10.78]Grown man only eats icing.
[163:12.16]Not anymore.
[163:12.46]I'm talking about when I was like five.
[163:25.07]Ooh!
[163:25.19]That makes it worse?
[163:26.18]You should eat icing on stream.
[163:57.64]That explains your flabby skin.
[163:59.40]Yeah?
[164:00.40]Where's that again?
[164:02.16]Excuse me, where's that again?
[164:05.89]Excuse me, you say I got flabby neck skin?
[164:08.11]Excuse me, what are you talking about?
[164:09.23]This is the most elastic fucking skin you've ever seen.
[164:16.23]That kind of hurt.
[164:19.95]Alright, what do I have to do?
[164:21.75]Who's in here?
[164:23.77]There's nobody in here!
[164:33.78]You're wearing a rubber mask.
[164:39.26]Oh, this is where I want to go.
[164:45.96]Okay.
[164:49.00]Now what is this?
[164:55.69]Oh, okay.
[165:01.80]I need wooden boards, 2,000 bucks, and old parts, and I can make a lot of new shit.
[165:13.47]I can't do any of this really yet.
[165:14.57]I can upgrade the house.
[165:17.25]$10,000.
[165:17.61]And I can get married.
[165:21.21]Okay, this game's cool.
[165:29.02]This is cool.
[165:31.43]I can't promise I'm going to play the hell out of this game, but it's definitely a fun game to check out.
[165:38.08]Now I want a donut.
[165:46.42]I'll make my own donuts.
[165:47.32]I don't know why I was thinking about this the other day, but... Did I ever tell you that story when I was cooking bacon with no clothes on?
[165:57.18]And the oil was just... Did I ever tell you that story before?
[166:03.86]Yeah.
[166:04.28]No, I definitely have.
[166:07.48]Here we go.
[166:07.84]Let me get... Here is your glasses.
[166:09.69]Tell it again.
[166:10.27]I don't... Question marks.
[166:11.97]Alright.
[166:22.50]so um Holly and I were making breakfast one time and oh I was like let's do a whole spread we're gonna do eggs bacon sausage you know like tomatoes and right just let's do everything
[166:39.17]And I was in charge of the bacon, right?
[166:42.27]I'll take care of the bacon.
[166:43.51]That's what I'll do.
[166:44.25]And on the stovetop.
[166:46.33]And I don't know why I was doing this.
[166:49.51]I have no answer for you.
[166:51.97]I was too lazy to put a shirt on.
[166:54.44]So I was just shirtless.
[166:56.24]Standing there cooking bacon in the pan.
[166:58.90]And just the eggs were over here.
[167:02.92]She was doing something over on the other side.
[167:04.50]Like we were preparing stuff.
[167:05.34]And I was just sitting there cooking the bacon.
[167:06.58]And it was just splashing oil.
[167:11.65]Hitting me in the chest.
[167:13.47]I just kept on going, ow!
[167:16.33]Ow!
[167:16.84]Ow!
[167:17.92]This is fucking burning me.
[167:20.32]I was just getting splashed with oil and I didn't even care.
[167:23.30]I didn't even care.
[167:24.41]I didn't move.
[167:25.97]It was just kind of hurting me.
[167:28.22]And Holly's just like, what are you doing?
[167:31.19]And I'm just like, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[167:32.61]It's not a big deal.
[167:33.37]Because I just, okay.
[167:35.17]I gotta go put a shirt on now.
[167:36.65]No.
[167:38.75]Whatever.
[167:39.33]I'm just gonna let it happen.
[167:42.71]It didn't hurt that much.
[167:44.66]Right?
[167:46.78]You're a Sims NPC.
[167:51.26]I just remember hearing like the pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[167:53.80]It was just like...
[167:57.13]And I had these little red dot marks all over my chest.
[168:05.90]But Holly laughs.
[168:07.02]She's like, I keep remembering you're just sitting there like shaking it with like pajama pants on, like tired.
[168:12.35]It was early in the morning.
[168:14.07]Just like, ah, it must've been so fucking crazy looking.
[168:23.40]And this wasn't ten seconds.
[168:25.70]This was probably five straight minutes.
[168:28.12]I had to have been doing it for at least a few minutes, right?
[168:34.17]You're a Skyrim NPC.
[168:35.67]Source engine NPC standing in fire.
[168:49.99]But I didn't care enough.
[168:52.66]Look, the pain threshold that I had to, alright, so put on a shirt so you don't get splashed with bacon oil and it hurts.
[169:01.56]It didn't cross that certain pain threshold.
[169:04.66]It was just enough where it was like, I don't care.
[169:07.00]If it was any higher, I would have put one on.
[169:11.92]We have aprons.
[169:13.78]Yeah, but the apron wouldn't even matter.
[169:15.22]Okay, so here's why the apron doesn't matter.
[169:18.78]If I had an apron on, aprons are from like here down.
[169:23.96]All this is still skin and flesh, all here.
[169:29.96]It still was like the neck.
[169:34.04]What kind of apron?
[169:34.62]Aprons are like overalls.
[169:36.17]You're wearing it wrong.
[169:51.89]There's only one way an apron goes on, and it doesn't cover your arms, bare arms, bare neck and clavicle area.
[170:01.71]I wasn't going to go put a sweater on.
[170:06.20]Skill issue.
[170:10.90]So wear a shirt.
[170:11.70]But I would have to go get it.
[170:12.92]I didn't want to go get it.
[170:17.58]That was a lot of experience.
[170:20.47]500 bucks, too!
[170:21.41]Holy smokes.
[170:26.75]Wait, you make bread?
[170:27.86]That's what my place is called.
[170:36.48]Okay.
[170:38.64]Has he given the speech yet?
[170:39.79]I haven't hit a million followers yet.
[170:43.66]Nice to have you.
[170:44.90]If you need tools or weapons, you can come to my shop.
[170:47.74]It's got the best selection around these parts.
[170:50.01]I'm not going to go gamble it.
[170:51.91]Dude, I have a hundred copper ore.
[170:56.43]This is not doing anything for me.
[170:59.71]Should I go buy some clothes?
[171:01.21]Ooh, yeah, let's do it.
[171:05.07]Okay.
[171:07.82]Work clothes.
[171:12.50]This is too much money.
[171:16.67]Okay, I did all those missions.
[171:18.19]I have some money now.
[171:18.99]Let's go back.
[171:20.43]You have a bread place.
[171:33.80]Take off the mask.
[171:41.08]Alright, I need to build the bridge.
[171:43.00]Let's go back home and assess what I need to build the bridge.
[171:59.41]I have to build the bridge.
[172:01.83]Okay.
[172:04.16]Copper, hardwood, and copper pipe.
[172:09.46]I need 20.
[172:09.94]Where do I get hardwood from?

[178:53.03]It felt like there were bugs in my nose, but that's not what it was.

[179:04.44]Like, heavy.
[179:17.02]Snorting bugs in the bathroom.
[179:20.92]Sounds like a rock band title for an album or something.
[179:39.64]And hear from their new album, Pain is snorting bugs in the bathroom.
[179:54.55]Copper blade and stone brick.
[179:59.37]Did I get it?
[180:06.99]I only made two of these?
[180:08.03]What are you, out of your mind?
[180:09.79]I need way more than that.
[180:12.89]Oh, I need wood.
[180:13.69]I don't have any wood, do I?
[180:19.63]Come on.
[180:22.97]Gotta go cut down some more trees.
[180:25.96]Let's go.
[180:26.32]I feel like I'm depleting the forest over here.
[180:39.79]There's some bugs hanging out of your nose?
[180:40.93]That's alright.
[180:52.44]No, I need 200 followers.
[180:55.16]This is crazy.
[180:56.42]I actually think I'm gonna hit it today.
[180:59.00]It's gonna happen today.
[181:01.14]Oh, I gotta think of something to say.
[181:02.40]Actually, I know what to say.
[181:03.46]I know what to say.
[181:04.20]I've been practicing in the mirror for months.
[181:07.06]I've been practicing this speech in the mirror for three months.
[181:23.04]I know it.
[181:23.62]I wrote it down too.
[181:24.36]I have a whole script.
[181:29.19]It's about seven or eight pages long.
[181:30.99]It's not going to take long.
[181:31.69]This is a quick speech talking about the channel and everything.
[181:35.11]It's probably be about 30 to 40 minutes in total length.
[181:39.26]Okay.
[182:00.03]It's going to be a false state of the union.
[182:01.68]I hope I don't get emotional.
[182:11.18]I might get emotional.
[182:12.06]I might start crying.
[182:13.64]I'm going to cry.
[182:14.22]I better be careful here.
[182:25.51]I want enough wood where I never have to cut a tree down again.
[182:28.51]That's what I want.
[182:50.07]I'm gonna cut down every single tree that I physically can.
[182:54.37]Around my residence.
[183:04.74]This might not be the game for you, dude.
[183:10.29]Who is this game for, then?
[183:14.03]It's a game where you run around and chop trees down and do errands and stuff.
[183:19.83]Who is this for?
[183:21.69]Who would this be for then?
[183:25.48]It's just a fun, chill game.
[183:28.98]Dude, this ain't for you.
[183:32.96]What is for me?
[183:36.26]What do you guys think is a game for me?
[183:38.27]If you're like, that's a game for you.
[183:47.53]Halo 2, please.
[183:55.23]Among Us.
[183:56.43]Oh.
[183:58.23]Kingdom Hearts.
[184:07.40]Undertale?
[184:08.10]Undertale was a game for me, you're right.
[184:10.62]That was great.
[184:22.56]Okay, I've cut down every single tree that's out in my backyard.
[184:25.16]So... There are no more trees left.
[184:34.56]Oh, it's okay.
[184:38.18]Alright.
[184:41.52]I need... I know, I know, I know, I know.
[184:45.14]What do I need?
[184:45.64]Wood... Copper blades.
[184:46.99]I need to turn this wood into... Oh, I can make a practice sword!
[184:52.51]Um, yeah?
[184:56.84]I finally have a weapon.
[184:58.28]Took me long enough.
[185:01.62]Let me get rid of some of this bullshit.
[185:03.56]Look at all this crap.
[185:08.70]Look at all this junk.
[185:10.73]Oh, you want four sofas in your backpack, sure.
[185:13.53]God, give me a break.
[185:17.03]Alright.
[185:18.99]Now what do I need to do?
[185:26.09]That's actually pretty cool.
[185:28.73]Alright, cool.
[185:29.25]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[185:33.72]There they are.
[185:34.22]When are you going to play Smite again?
[185:38.85]I don't know.
[185:44.67]Okay, now I need stone bricks.
[185:47.17]Maybe a few more of these.
[185:48.11]I need that wood.
[185:51.69]Fuel depleted.
[185:53.37]Go for it.
[185:54.42]Stone brick.
[185:55.16]Let's make a shitload.
[185:56.24]It's gonna take a little bit.
[185:59.32]Uh, whatever.
[186:07.70]Bricks?
[186:08.12]Yep.
[186:11.22]I need... And then I can finally build the bridge.
[186:13.80]I've been sitting on it for like an hour.
[186:16.76]Check the follower count.
[186:18.24]9983.
[186:18.26]Are you going to weld again?
[186:28.21]When have I ever welded?
[186:40.61]That's still going, right?
[186:42.85]Five hours.
[186:44.14]Oh.
[186:53.44]That's actually not that long.
[186:56.95]So I finally have a sword.
[186:57.79]That means I can go fight stuff.
[187:02.51]Oh, I need copper pipes, too.
[187:03.95]I need, like, three copper pipes.
[187:10.77]To make the bridge.
[187:21.16]I love this.
[187:21.94]It's so funny.
[187:23.72]It says one million.
[187:24.68]It doesn't say for me.
[187:32.47]You need two bridge heads, so four pipes.
[187:34.23]Oh, shit.
[187:34.61]Okay.
[187:35.53]I'll add one.
[187:41.77]That'll take a little bit.
[187:42.63]This'll take a little bit.
[187:43.77]So this is all gonna take a little bit.
[187:45.03]So I can go do something else now.
[187:48.03]Um, should I go dig?
[187:50.24]What else do I need for the bridge?
[187:59.62]Three.
[188:00.04]Oh, it's three copper pipe.
[188:04.68]Wait a minute.
[188:06.69]Oh, you're right.
[188:07.85]Okay, so it's two.
[188:10.43]Two head, one body.
[188:14.39]So I need six copper pipes.
[188:18.53]And then I need bronze.
[188:19.63]I need tin and copper, which I have a lot of, I think.
[188:23.65]Okay.
[188:24.19]Alright, I should get it soon.
[188:26.03]I do need more copper pipes.
[188:34.46]There we go.
[188:37.82]Uh, I need more brick.
[188:39.78]So we're gonna change these after these are done.
[188:43.40]Wait, I can do it on this one.
[188:48.94]Do max 10.
[188:49.54]That looks good.
[188:52.08]Refuel.

[189:17.55]What the hell was it?
[189:20.87]What was it to make the... Small planet box.
[189:28.48]Wooden board from the cutter.
[189:32.13]Okay.
[189:32.61]So I'm not quite there yet.
[189:38.33]I'll do it all tomorrow.
[189:39.11]I'm just going to bed.
[189:39.65]Fuck it.
[189:53.69]When are you gonna eat the Smash Bros.
[189:55.15]Ultimate Donut from Dunkin' Donuts?
[189:57.15]Are you an AI that was trained on the last hour of this stream?
[190:10.04]There we go.
[190:10.66]Give me all those bricks.
[190:18.71]Okay.
[190:21.33]Ta-da!
[190:22.67]Very cool.
[190:23.35]Now I can make the hardwood.
[190:28.13]Why am I running out of space?
[190:37.65]I gotta cut this down.
[190:49.12]Okay, now...
[190:52.03]Hardwood plank.
[190:54.25]Wooden board.
[190:57.80]What do I need?
[191:05.96]I need wooden boards.

[191:29.91]Okay, hardwood planks and copper pipes.
[191:31.71]I got it.

[191:43.43]Let me put some stuff away and go on an adventure.
[192:02.10]Okay.
[192:03.64]I got a full inventory.
[192:04.58]I got full health.
[192:05.64]I got my sword.
[192:06.34]I'm ready.
[192:08.36]That's going to take a little while.
[192:09.38]It'll take till tomorrow.
[192:10.18]So now, I'm just going to go somewhere and just fight something.
[192:16.36]What's on the map?
[192:19.04]Fishing spot.
[192:21.16]Fishing spot.
[192:22.08]Should I go to the other ruins?
[192:25.26]Banner Ruins 2.

[192:29.91]I got money.
[192:30.35]I can buy it.
[192:39.71]Capture your follower count and put it on stream?
[192:43.32]Um, I think it's going to be too late to do that by the time I do that.
[192:47.22]There's only 100.
[192:48.72]Only 100 followers before... Hey!
[192:53.60]Let's go!

[193:13.62]Yeah, whatever.
[193:19.32]Do it.
[193:20.14]Hold on.
[193:22.62]Should I do a live count?

[196:02.82]Stop!
[196:08.67]What the fuck?
[196:09.97]No, go the other way.
[196:20.85]You're not gonna do it to me like this, are you?
[196:27.55]We'll find out.
[196:33.45]What the fuck?!
[196:34.41]Holy shit!
[196:35.69]Oh my god!
[196:36.75]Alright.
[196:37.93]But wait!
[196:38.65]You're gonna screw up my metrics!
[196:40.31]You're gonna mess up my metrics.
[196:41.25]Don't all of you unfollow at the same time.
[196:42.71]You're gonna actually kill my metrics.
[196:44.71]My analytics are gonna be dog shit at the end of this.
[196:58.74]You're gonna kill my analytics.
[197:09.99]I'm going to the mines.
[197:29.53]Sell, sell, sell.
[197:35.27]How much is this one to go in?
[197:38.61]Under inspection, what?
[197:49.27]Get rid of the count?
[197:50.13]You guys all told me to put the count on and now everyone's freaking out saying remove the count because everyone's gonna unsubscribe.
[197:57.93]Don't do that!
[198:03.34]I wanna talk to the horse.
[198:04.92]Level 20?
[198:05.18]Can I just leave?
[198:26.85]What do you want?
[198:29.82]Okay.
[198:29.98]What do you need?
[198:31.48]Alright, sea urchins.
[198:32.20]I can do it.
[198:33.34]Oh.
[198:33.44]Oh, they're fighting back.
[199:21.30]Come on!
[199:39.30]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[199:47.38]It needs to happen right when the beat drops.
[199:50.76]By the way, why am I doing this on my phone?
[199:52.48]I could do it over... Why would I... What am I doing?
[199:57.26]Why would I do this on the telephone?
[199:59.20]That's fucking stupid.
[200:07.48]Alright, here we go!
[200:17.81]Why would I do this on the phone?
[200:18.79]I have a computer in front of me.
[200:21.16]Come on, let's go!
[200:22.68]Let's hit it!
[200:41.71]Hold on, I gotta turn this like smooth jazz down.
[200:46.57]This is it!
[200:47.91]Here comes a million!
[201:10.58]We like to party.
[201:12.50]We like, we like to party.
[201:14.02]We like to party.
[201:16.83]Come on.
[201:17.51]You have to do it at the beat drop or I'm never doing this again.
[202:02.42]like a smaller number.
[202:03.26]Has anyone ever actually got to that part of the song?
[202:14.86]I feel like everyone always stops at 45 seconds.
[202:18.19]Hey, that's a million followers.
[202:19.39]Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[202:27.71]That's cool.
[202:31.19]Alright, well, I gotta tell you, I gotta give my speech now.
[202:44.46]Stop this.
[202:47.22]Hey, come on, it's a big deal.
[202:49.87]Alright, let me give you my speech.
[202:51.47]Here's my speech.
[202:52.57]This is a big deal to me.
[202:57.07]Because my old YouTube channel, right?
[203:00.77]Just Jerma985.
[203:02.53]Second Jerma.
[203:03.47]Twitter.
[203:04.77]Doesn't matter.
[203:06.01]I've never been to a million followers across any platform.
[203:09.89]Even the old YouTube channel.
[203:11.27]Even Jerma985 did not have a million subscribers.
[203:15.73]Once I got to about five or six hundred thousand, I stopped doing YouTube videos, right?
[203:23.58]Moved over here.
[203:24.82]The second channel doesn't have a million.
[203:27.68]This is the first place where I've ever had a million followers.
[203:33.20]So that's really... That's crazy.
[203:36.22]Um... I know that there's a lot of other people that have way more than a million followers, but... Whatever.
[203:44.16]It's still... That's really cool.
[203:46.64]It's the first time I've ever seen it.
[203:51.29]I'm gonna take this moment.
[203:53.11]And I'm gonna cherish it.
[203:53.77]I'm gonna fall asleep on the ground.
[203:57.84]Where's my house?
[204:07.01]But yeah, I... I've never stuck around in a place long enough to make enough videos or streams or whatever to get past a million.
[204:23.06]But yeah, that's... That's a lot of people.
[204:26.82]What is this?
[204:28.93]Why are there snake berries?
[204:40.31]Ooh, that looks nice.
[204:49.24]Did I ever think I was gonna get to a million followers?
[204:53.46]Um... I don't know.
[204:56.96]Not really.
[205:00.92]But it's been a very, very long time.
[205:05.06]But I switched.
[205:06.42]I was YouTuber, then I was a streamer, and then I did YouTube, a second channel, and I don't really tweet that much.
[205:13.97]I think I only have, like, I say only have, but when you're using the million follower kind of mark here, I have like 300,000 followers.
[205:24.67]That's a lot of followers, but just not even close.
[205:28.07]So I just kept kind of switching.
[205:32.83]But it means a lot.
[205:33.37]I'm happy that people think this channel's cool.
[205:35.37]I hope you continue to do so.
[205:40.15]There's a handful of fun things I think that are really interesting that we're gonna do.
[205:44.69]In the future here.
[205:47.36]So... Thanks.
[205:50.88]Thanks for sticking around.
[205:53.40]Some of you guys have been here for ten years.
[205:54.80]Some of you guys have been here for two months.
[205:57.78]I hope I can continue to do the things you like.
[206:02.53]Because that's what I'm trying to do.
[206:05.04]And that's it.
[206:05.42]That's really all there is to it.
[206:06.94]Thanks for a million followers.
[206:09.12]Very cool.
[206:15.65]Alright, what do I need?
[206:16.31]Hardwood planks?
[206:19.85]Did I not make hardwood planks?
[206:26.34]I thought I made hardwood planks.
[206:27.56]That was the point.
[206:35.54]10 plus years, yeah.
[206:39.18]I'm honestly shocked that I've been able to make it this far.
[206:45.56]I'm still just kind of going.
[206:48.04]And... I know it's a tough business.
[206:52.20]It's a tough kind of thing to do.
[206:55.35]I'm shocked that this many years later, I'm still here.
[206:59.05]And that people still care.
[207:00.07]That's genuinely shocking to me all the time.
[207:03.19]So... Because I know that this is like, you know, this business, right?
[207:07.27]Streaming, YouTuber, kind of influencer, whatever you want to say.
[207:12.75]I mean, you can go up just as fast as you went down.
[207:15.65]You can go down just as fast as you went up.
[207:18.39]So I'm glad I've been able to kind of still be at it.
[207:25.34]Who's he talking to?
[207:36.88]Not showing emotion?
[207:40.98]I mean, I... But think about it, right?
[207:43.12]I still... How did... Why did I use all this?
[207:45.61]I need hardwood.
[207:46.57]Hardwood!
[207:51.39]I need a better pickaxe or whatever.
[208:00.03]Can I upgrade this one, or do I have to make, like, a bronze axe or something?
[208:04.74]Wait, I can break this?
[208:06.40]No, shit.
[208:17.99]You should unban everybody for ten years.
[208:20.87]Or for a million.
[208:29.37]No, I've talked about this kind of stuff before.
[208:31.17]You know how it is.
[208:34.82]I'm not going to change much.
[208:36.84]It's just the same as it has always probably been.
[208:41.40]Still doing what I'm doing.
[208:42.38]Still trying to do things that are fun.
[208:43.64]And that's it.
[208:44.86]That's it.
[208:45.28]That's it.
[208:51.51]Free Ballfondler.
[208:53.63]Ballfondler is actually banned.
[209:02.53]Just wait, what did that person say?
[209:03.67]Don't do another one of those famous big-headed rants?
[209:06.89]Just don't do another one of your famous... Oh.
[209:29.17]Okay, so...
[209:32.26]Alright, what am I doing now?
[209:33.11]Collect... I gotta collect spines.
[209:35.53]And I need to get hard... I need a better axe that's important.
[209:37.63]How do I get a better axe?
[209:39.57]Help me.
[209:39.91]Where do I get a better axe from?
[209:49.42]Do I have 2,000 bucks yet?
[209:50.48]Do I have to go to the Home Depot and do it?
[209:56.58]Okay.
[209:56.68]Okay.
[210:02.15]Okay.
[210:02.41]How much money?
[210:03.85]I only have $700.
[210:04.29]What the hell?
[210:04.87]I need to upgrade my axe.
[210:29.97]Work table, level 1.
[210:31.41]Upgrade.
[210:32.93]2,000 bucks.
[210:35.23]I need 20 wooden boards.
[210:36.46]Are you shitting me?
[210:40.46]I gotta make more money.
[210:41.18]Alright, I need another 1,000 dollars.
[210:42.54]I have the old parts.
[210:43.98]I need 10 more wooden boards.
[210:49.33]Happy for you?
[210:51.03]Thank you.
[210:58.70]The cabin by the lake has a free axe.
[211:01.48]I'm seriously thanks for backseating because I really don't want to spend all this money.
[211:05.20]Cabin by the lake?
[211:09.58]Like down here?
[211:11.20]How do I get over here though?
[211:23.93]No help.
[211:34.35]Hope that what you have planned is as exciting as you hope.
[211:39.49]I think that there's some really fun things in the pipeline here.
[211:42.72]Baseball is going to be really fun.
[211:45.18]There's something immediately after baseball.
[211:48.06]Probably in the fall.
[211:50.50]That is going to take a lot of resources to do.
[211:54.71]But I think it's going to be fun.
[211:55.93]I think it'll be funny.
[211:58.29]If it's not, it's not.
[212:00.71]You mean over here?
[212:17.24]It's gonna be modded Skyrim.
[212:19.12]That's right, bro.
[212:20.48]Modded Skyrim.
[212:36.65]Alright, so he's saying that there's an axe in the shed over here.
[212:41.03]Are you full of... Are you full of crap?
[212:43.89]Were you full of crap?
[212:57.56]He said there was an axe over here.
[212:58.66]Hey, were you full of hot air?
[213:04.08]Is this it?
[213:05.83]Dude, there's just fur in here.
[213:09.49]I can't believe that person's full of hot air.
[213:27.16]Wait, hold on.
[213:27.74]There's a chest right there, too.
[213:31.60]By the lake, not the sea.
[213:34.98]Where am I?
[213:45.51]Oh, you mean like right here.
[213:46.43]Hey, let's go.
[214:03.09]How many woodland creatures have you consumed?
[214:05.81]Just one.
[214:07.09]Just one.
[214:08.37]This one.
[214:09.11]Never mind.
[214:09.69]Level 20.
[214:10.43]Fuck it.
[214:10.67]Let's go for it.
[214:19.26]Just unlock it.
[214:19.86]I'll be fine.
[214:26.87]I'm going to get like a million experience for this.
[214:33.36]That's it?
[214:43.77]Can I eat some berries?
[214:44.75]I can.
[214:56.20]Free pumpkins?
[215:03.93]This is the house by the lake.
[215:05.73]I don't see an axe.
[215:12.41]House by the lake.
[215:13.99]Unless you're talking about that shed up there.
[215:16.09]They said cabin.
[215:16.93]Okay.
[215:27.10]You know what else I was thinking too?
[215:28.12]What do you guys have to say about this?
[215:34.47]Am I gonna go crazy here?
[215:35.93]Should I- are we gonna- am I gonna go nuts right now?
[215:38.13]You ready for this one?
[215:39.35]What do you guys think for the one- for one million followers?
[215:42.73]What do you guys think about this?
[215:44.15]I'm gonna- I'm gonna mention something here.
[215:50.57]Let me think about it.
[215:52.23]Let me think about it.
[215:56.48]There's nothing in this shed!
[216:14.33]Let me think about this for a little bit.
[216:16.91]I have an idea.
[216:19.66]I've got an idea.
[216:22.26]It's something that a lot of people are going to be really happy about.
[216:24.54]Especially if you've been here for over five to ten years.
[216:28.82]I think this sounds like a fun idea.
[216:32.61]No, I'm not going to do doi doi doi again.
[216:34.73]That's what you think I'm going to do for a million followers.
[216:36.39]You're out of your mind. ...
[216:44.28]There's nothing in the shed!
[216:45.44]And now it's time for bed.
[216:54.47]There's not another shed on the water, right?
[217:04.16]Wait, can I, like, go... Can I do this?
[217:06.86]No, I can't, can I?
[217:13.12]It's like, oh, dig in the shed.
[217:14.20]No.
[217:15.22]Nothing here.
[217:23.99]We'll see.
[217:24.41]Alright, I'm going to tell you the idea.
[217:26.97]There's two different ideas.
[217:32.73]Say it.
[217:58.14]Oh, I was like, why am I kicking his body?
[217:59.66]Oh no, Mr. Ladybug!
[218:19.98]I can do the spine thing too.
[218:25.16]I do need shit.
[218:30.77]Yeah, I'll tell you the idea in a couple days.
[218:33.61]When I'm live on Tuesday, I'll let you know.
[218:35.77]But I think this could be fun.
[218:39.47]Stalling, stalling.
[218:40.53]Well, I don't know if I want to do it yet.
[218:42.01]And I don't want to say I want to do something without being like, yeah, I want to do it.
[218:48.14]He's stalling.
[218:48.82]Yeah.
[218:49.70]Call me Stalling Steven.
[218:51.86]I'm fine with that.
[219:00.21]Because what if I say this thing that I think is interesting and then everybody freaks out?
[219:03.60]And then like a month goes by and I don't do it, right?
[219:05.70]Because I'm like, nah, never mind.
[219:09.66]Okay, I gotta go to bed.
[219:16.25]Am I gonna make it home?
[219:22.67]That's most of your ideas?
[219:25.56]Well, not most of them.
[219:27.10]That's most of the gameplay, video game related ideas.
[219:31.02]Sometimes I just don't do them.
[219:37.48]Well, yeah, then I'm going to stop saying stuff.
[219:43.62]McD's?
[219:48.79]I just bought a cow.
[219:51.59]What?
[219:51.81]I have chickens too?
[219:52.45]I have a chicken and a cow.
[219:55.34]And a duck.
[219:58.64]How do I take care of these?
[219:59.48]I need to put them into a shed.
[220:03.96]Do I have a shed?
[220:25.78]Alright, let's go.
[220:26.72]Can I put them here?
[220:29.04]Can I just have like a cow kind of walking around?
[220:37.18]I hate this like sassy worm, you know what I mean?
[220:43.25]Can I put this... I can't put you down?
[220:47.57]Can you go in the house?
[220:54.81]shit I can't put I can't put the cow down they're gonna be they're gonna be okay just in an inventory right they're not dead they're alive they're fine
[221:21.95]Alright, let me focus.
[221:23.95]My focusing problems are just seriously so bad.
[221:27.39]I need an axe.
[221:30.88]So to make a better axe, I need to have a better table.
[221:34.36]To have a better table, I need 1500 more gold.
[221:38.92]So I need to do missions.
[221:40.75]That's what we're going to do.
[221:41.87]Let me open up my mission book.
[221:46.73]Okay, that's the big one.
[221:50.19]Okay, Emily gave you a recipe for a small planter box.
[221:54.87]Plant those seeds.
[221:56.05]Let's do that right now.
[221:56.87]I need that small planter box.
[222:08.76]Okay, small planter box.
[222:11.70]I will take a planter box.
[222:14.52]Now let's go ahead and put that planter box somewhere.
[222:20.93]This is a pretty large planter box.
[222:24.21]Put it right here.
[222:27.84]Press the right mouse button or left trigger to check the crop status.
[222:33.96]Okay.
[222:37.88]Alright.
[222:38.66]Fishing day.
[222:39.30]Who cares?
[222:41.26]Hold the seeds and click in front of the planter box.
[222:44.30]Is there a certain type of food I need to make here?
[222:54.69]Does it matter?
[222:55.11]I think I only have one seed bag.
[223:01.84]Cotton.
[223:03.74]And... Green barrel.
[223:08.00]Bamboo papaya.
[223:12.74]And wheat.
[223:14.57]Okay.
[223:16.11]Why are you storing poop?
[223:17.19]Because I need it for this.
[223:27.53]Okay.
[223:31.33]How many should I put here?
[223:33.59]I can only put one.
[223:34.59]Alright, so do I need to water it?
[223:44.95]Prepare a present for the town and give it to the mayor.
[223:48.99]I don't care.
[223:51.99]So this would be ready in check status.
[223:55.33]Four days.
[223:57.78]I need fertilizer.
[223:59.08]Oh, shit.
[224:01.38]Do I have fertilizer?
[224:04.20]Oh, it's a poop.
[224:12.93]Where's the... This is fertilizer, right?
[224:19.14]Is this not fertilizer?
[224:26.22]I don't think I have it.
[224:28.45]Unless this is supposed to be fertilizer.
[224:30.07]No.
[224:37.87]I have to process this poop into fertilizer?
[224:40.17]What do you mean?
[224:55.37]To put the poop in the grinder?
[225:09.47]I need to make a blender?
[225:10.39]I don't know.
[225:13.13]I don't know where the fertilizer is.
[225:15.81]Pigment, juice... Oh!
[225:20.05]I thought this was a tropical drink!
[225:24.03]I thought there was an umbrella sticking out of a tropical drink.
[225:26.57]I didn't know that's what that was.
[225:42.13]There we go.
[225:42.59]Fertilizer.
[225:45.03]More?
[225:49.23]Okay.
[225:50.39]Alright, four days.
[225:54.44]Now... I need to make... Okay, so that's gonna give me some money.
[225:58.64]I'm gonna go collect the spines.
[226:00.64]Bro!
[226:01.20]I'm ready.
[226:05.30]I'm gonna sneeze, I think.
[226:06.50]I hope not.
[226:18.02]One of the reasons why I have so much trouble playing these games is because I need somebody to come after me and look in the inventory and be like, I'll get rid of this, I'll get rid of that.
[226:25.76]We don't need the apples.
[226:26.86]I collect a lot of stuff.
[226:30.64]And somebody else has to come and just sort it for me because I don't know what to do with all this.
[226:35.44]Somebody needs to be playing the game with me and walk around and be like, okay, well, we're taking that out of here.
[226:41.09]Because they don't need to be in there.
[226:44.60]You know what I mean?
[226:45.34]What do I need to do with all this?
[226:46.66]I don't know what to do with everything.
[226:48.81]Give the mayor feces.
[226:51.33]Fine.
[226:52.05]I'll do that joke.
[226:53.93]We'll do the funny joke where I give shit to somebody.
[227:01.90]Alright.
[227:02.42]Let me... I have so much dog shit.
[227:09.12]I need another box.
[227:10.28]I need to make another box.
[227:15.05]Talisman?
[227:17.77]Oh!
[227:19.11]Five defense.
[227:20.31]Let's go.
[227:20.63]Oh, it's gonna happen at some point.
[227:30.76]Wait, I can make another one of these.
[227:32.78]Yeah, let's go.
[227:33.06]Okay.
[227:48.20]Alright, what do I want to put here?
[227:49.68]What is it?
[227:50.00]What is here?
[227:51.44]Cotton.
[227:51.86]Alright, I want to put wheat here instead.
[227:53.91]Where's the wheat?
[228:04.87]I hate having so much shit.
[228:08.04]I have to just throw it all away.
[228:10.04]Hold on to all the artifact pieces!
[228:11.62]You know what I have to do?
[228:13.60]I have to make a box that's behind the fucking house.
[228:17.08]I'm gonna put this box behind the house and put all these stupid-ass artifact pieces in there.
[228:22.90]Just all back here.
[228:24.42]I don't even care about them.
[228:26.42]You have to collect eight pieces of this dumb thing.
[228:28.66]No, I'm just hiding it for myself.
[228:34.97]I don't want cotton in here!
[228:37.29]What?
[228:39.01]No!
[228:39.33]Just pull that out.
[228:44.36]There we go.
[228:46.44]Wheat.
[228:49.24]There's a stupid-ass fertilizer!
[228:52.34]I need to make another box right now.
[228:53.74]I'm throwing everything in the trash.
[228:55.23]This is literally gonna be a trash.
[228:58.09]Where is it?
[228:59.85]Wooden storage.
[229:01.81]This is a trash, by the way.
[229:02.87]I'm using this as a trash can.
[229:08.02]So many miscellaneous stupid fucking relic pieces.
[229:12.02]Just put them over here, I don't even care.
[229:22.80]Wait, like, all the- No!
[229:24.34]All this- Look, this stuff.
[229:29.25]I don't want it.
[229:29.77]Oh, like an engine!
[229:34.05]Awww, an old thermos!
[229:35.61]An old pipe!
[229:48.83]I'll just forget about this for a year.
[229:50.11]I don't even care.
[229:56.47]Weird glass engine.
[229:58.23]Okay, sell it.
[230:04.93]The box in front of your house is the game trash.
[230:07.91]Does it sell it?
[230:08.73]Like Stardew?
[230:16.83]No more resources.
[230:17.67]I can't.
[230:17.87]It doesn't work.
[230:21.67]Alright.
[230:21.91]What else do I have?
[230:22.41]I'm going to put the animals away too.
[230:24.03]It's just like I have too much random shit.
[230:40.75]I have too much random shit.
[230:42.67]Honestly, I want like an appraiser to come to my house and just be like, go in the boxes and fucking just give me... I don't care, just give me money.
[230:48.31]What happened to all the stuff that I said?
[231:05.92]Okay, give me this, give me this, give me this, give me this, give me this.
[231:20.33]I wish I could bring these and just deposit them to the research center.
[231:22.81]You need the whole set.
[231:28.60]Okay.
[231:32.54]Alright, now what do I want to take with me?
[231:37.52]Press L3.
[231:39.30]Everything is a singular item.
[231:47.29]Alright, just get rid of this stuff now.
[231:48.97]Okay, I'll keep this.
[231:53.05]Put the juice down here.
[231:54.53]What?
[232:04.46]Okay.
[232:05.94]Alright, I'm ready to play.
[232:09.10]Select the locked space in your bag.
[232:16.90]That was 400 gold!
[232:18.50]You just made me spend $400?
[232:20.56]I need 2,000!
[232:25.05]I'm never gonna make it to two grand.
[232:26.45]Alright, yes I will.
[232:27.21]Let's go.
[232:28.23]Collect the spines.
[232:33.93]The farmer.
[232:35.15]Alright.
[232:35.69]We're getting that one done.
[232:36.81]The fishing rod.
[232:37.41]Don't care.
[232:38.31]Meet people.
[232:39.07]We can just go talk to people.
[232:40.27]That doesn't give us any money though.
[232:41.75]Fix the fence.
[232:45.21]Wooden boards to fix the fence around the tree farm.
[232:47.11]Alright.
[232:47.93]Wooden boards.
[232:48.63]I got wooden boards.
[232:50.33]And then I need spines.
[232:51.35]Wooden boards and spines.
[232:52.37]Let's go.
[232:52.69]Where are the wooden boards?
[233:00.93]Okay.
[233:01.13]I need one more dumbass wooden board.
[233:14.65]Alright, hurry up.
[233:16.19]An hour?
[233:16.90]Fuck off.
[233:17.24]Alright, in the meantime, I'll go get the spines, right?
[233:28.16]Weren't they down here?
[233:28.76]This is where the wooden fence is.
[233:41.17]Go get spines, right?
[233:42.41]Where was it?
[233:42.69]Down here?
[233:50.60]High level sea urchins near the fall will drop the spines.
[233:55.65]What?
[234:10.06]The waterfall?
[234:17.42]Where's our waterfall?
[234:20.95]Have to go east side?
[234:21.75]Alright, well that's gonna take too long.
[234:25.28]It's fucking 100 bucks.
[234:26.28]That guy can... Literally, I don't care.
[234:35.28]Jeremy, you keep getting meaner every stream.
[234:39.08]I'm not mean!
[234:44.13]Use the necklace.
[234:52.95]How do I use it?
[235:25.99]Okay, let's go.
[235:35.99]So now I'm going where?
[235:37.69]Tree farm.
[235:40.22]I don't even have close to $2,000.
[235:42.26]I'm never going to get there.
[235:44.74]I'm never going to have 2,000.
[235:46.14]Did I say followers?
[235:49.88]What did I just say?
[235:56.62]Did I say gold or followers?
[236:02.72]I said dollars.
[236:03.28]Alright.
[236:09.53]Okay.
[236:12.03]150 bucks.
[236:14.47]Now the tree farm is in business?
[236:15.59]I wonder what this does.
[236:17.49]Okay.
[236:19.88]So now... Any more quests for money?
[236:24.63]I'm just gonna go sell all the couches and shit.
[236:27.25]That should give me at least a thousand.
[236:34.42]I need bronze to upgrade the axe.
[236:42.08]But I don't have the recipe to make a bronze axe.
[236:53.12]When he wins the green screen stream?
[236:54.26]The green screen stream is going to be... Well, your submissions is today.
[237:00.84]Tonight, 12 a.m.
[237:02.28]Pacific.
[237:03.32]Last chance to put it in.
[237:09.18]And then probably five or six days later, we'll do the stream.
[237:12.74]It depends on how long it takes to go through the submissions.
[237:15.26]Could be longer, could be shorter.
[237:16.34]I'll let you know in a couple days.
[237:18.02]You will know.
[237:20.30]Okay.
[237:22.38]So...
[237:27.13]I... You're saying I can upgrade the axe without upgrading the bench?
[237:37.25]Okay.
[237:37.94]Upgrade kit, bronze bar.
[237:39.76]Alright, I can do... Wait, I can.
[237:41.02]You're right.
[237:41.32]Holy shit.
[237:45.08]Bronze bar is tin and copper.
[237:46.68]Alright, let's go.
[237:47.30]Okay.
[237:54.09]Alright, I gotta go back to the mine and get tin and copper.
[237:57.34]And then I'll be able to do it.
[237:59.42]Maybe not.
[238:01.68]Wait a minute.
[238:02.18]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[238:07.75]Copper.
[238:08.17]I need this copper ore.
[238:09.75]Shit.
[238:09.99]Alright, I gotta go get some more of this crap.
[238:14.68]I'll be back.
[238:22.35]He just said, alright, let's go, and he stared at the storage menu four times.
[238:25.99]I know, dude, it's... I... 200 bucks?!
[238:26.95]Why did the price go up?!
[238:27.62]200?!
[238:27.64]What?!
[238:28.02]It was 80 last week!
[238:58.33]I need tin and copper.
[239:01.33]I'm just digging straight down from here.
[239:05.83]There's copper.
[239:19.54]Any relics?
[239:21.48]Uh-huh.
[239:34.30]There we go.
[239:35.04]I need copper and tin.
[239:47.38]And then some kind of, like, weird tool upgrade kit, right?
[240:06.60]Ooh, okay.
[240:07.90]Ooh.
[240:09.28]Let's go up and then down.
[240:18.54]Data disk, cool.
[240:23.52]I don't even need the scanner.
[240:27.62]Do I actually, maybe do I have to activate with the scanner?
[240:30.48]Probably.
[240:37.01]Small engine.
[240:37.83]Another one of these.
[240:43.77]This game makes me sick.
[240:46.25]Like, physically ill?
[240:47.35]That's strange.
[240:49.13]Why?
[240:49.33]Are you getting motion sickness from this game?
[240:52.45]Really?
[240:52.95]I'm sorry to hear that.
[240:55.48]Hopefully you're alright.
[241:07.40]You should probably have a banana.
[241:09.22]Okay, I have a lot of these data discs too.
[241:24.21]I'll go this way.
[241:31.42]You bet your ass that I'm going to upgrade that axe.
[241:43.46]What's that?
[241:43.82]Is this another clock?
[241:48.08]Another small... I gotta sell all this stuff.
[241:50.69]Please remind me.
[241:59.31]The resolution's too small?
[242:03.50]I mean, it's like 1440p.
[242:04.62]Why?
[242:04.84]What is that?
[242:07.18]Why are you saying that?
[242:20.91]I don't want to be in the soil.
[242:22.03]I want to be... Yeah, get me out of here.
[242:24.05]I want to be up where the tin is.
[242:24.91]Tin Andy.
[242:31.10]Stop.
[242:31.38]Shut up.
[242:31.70]There we go.
[242:46.16]I just need a bunch of this.
[242:55.49]Turn on the scanner.
[242:56.11]Okay, there's some stuff over here.
[242:59.57]This is perfect.
[243:01.77]I promise I'm gonna... This bridge is going to be fixed within the time period of me turning the stream off.
[243:07.97]I promise.
[243:09.94]Jerma, you have a pot belly.
[243:13.16]Yeah?
[243:22.00]I don't give a shit.
[243:32.98]Yeah, hey, I like food.
[243:36.13]Who cares?
[243:36.71]Oh, I like to eat.
[243:39.11]I like to eat.
[243:39.95]Fuck you.
[243:41.31]I like food, man.
[243:42.82]That one hit a nerve.
[244:01.77]Super defense mechanism just coming through on that one.
[244:07.33]Oh my god.
[244:20.17]I definitely have enough at this point to go do this.
[244:22.45]I'm out of here.
[244:31.25]The pot belly is a sexy upgrade to a beer belly.
[244:33.69]Well, that's the thing.
[244:34.97]I don't drink beer.
[244:36.17]I mean, at the beerio cart thing, I drank, like, fucking seven or eight or ten.
[244:40.63]I don't even remember.
[244:41.21]It was a lot.
[244:52.92]Gotta get out of here.
[244:55.54]Ooh, shit.
[244:59.02]Dried apple slices.
[245:00.16]Alright.
[245:07.48]Address the toad thing.
[245:08.96]What toad thing?
[245:09.58]Alright, is there anything I can start that will happen overnight?
[245:17.82]Yeah, all this shit.
[245:18.84]Okay.
[245:19.97]Bronze bar.
[245:20.49]I need wood in my inventory.
[245:28.21]You said... No, no, no, no.
[245:29.75]That's not what I was saying.
[245:33.67]Did I already use the 200 wood that I... No way.
[245:38.43]I used all 195 wood already?
[245:43.26]What?
[245:45.94]No, I didn't.
[245:55.57]Bronze bar.
[246:01.91]Bronze bar.
[246:10.72]This will be ready in the morning.
[246:11.62]Alright, that's fine.
[246:14.00]This will be ready in the morning.
[246:18.28]No context.
[246:20.23]Okay, wait, no, no.
[246:20.85]You're talking about when I said I was the toad thing.
[246:24.23]Yeah, I used to turn around and drive in Mario Kart to try to get toad when I was losing.
[246:36.61]In Mario Kart, if I was doing really poorly, if I was in 6th or 7th place and there was only one lap to go, I would turn around and try to find Toad and drive into him.
[246:47.15]No, okay, I know what you're talking about.
[246:48.19]And then I came over and grabbed the mic and I was like, oh, I'm thinking about Toad in this next one.
[246:52.10]Yeah, what I was saying is like, hey, I'm thinking about turning around and driving into Toad.
[246:56.70]Like, hey, I'm thinking about fucking, you know, I'm thinking about Toad.
[247:00.64]Yeah, come on.
[247:02.60]Get out of here.
[247:05.82]Only... What?
[247:06.96]These are still going?
[247:08.00]How?
[247:11.54]Fuel depleted.
[247:12.44]Oh, shit.
[247:15.21]Okay, what do I need?
[247:19.23]Three bronze bars.
[247:20.45]Upgrade kit from... Alright, I gotta go get a tool thing.
[247:23.63]We're bringing a bunch of couches and I'm selling them all.
[247:25.31]Okay.
[247:38.92]Where are those couches?
[247:39.66]Alright.
[247:45.40]I'm selling all this shit.
[247:49.14]I don't want any of it.
[247:50.12]I don't want it anymore.
[248:07.94]Okay.
[248:11.55]Alright.
[248:13.53]It's time to sell.
[248:17.27]Not wait.
[248:20.19]I'm selling this.
[248:25.17]I'm going to bring my CDs and I'll turn them into something.
[248:29.41]I'm selling the clock.
[248:30.35]I'm selling the bugs.
[248:31.30]I'm selling the engine.
[248:39.72]I should make a decent amount of money here.
[248:43.25]I'm just gonna sell all the engines, I don't care.
[248:46.69]Sell both clocks.
[248:51.86]I'm selling all these engines.
[248:56.48]Alright, let's do it.
[249:03.84]What is the worm stream?
[249:06.24]You mean when I do the worm for an hour straight?
[249:08.96]I break the Guinness Book of World Records doing the worm as long as possible.
[249:16.33]Alright, I need to go just to a... How do I sell?
[249:23.06]Can I sell to anybody that has a store?
[249:27.56]That is a huge cat.
[249:29.64]Holy shit.
[249:36.76]What are cats like?
[249:44.66]The cat's not a bird!
[249:47.82]Alright, sell.
[249:54.34]Nice.
[249:55.44]Alright, there we go.
[249:57.07]Finally.
[250:06.81]Who else has a store?
[250:07.78]I need to sell this.
[250:09.20]I gotta sell sofas.
[250:10.04]I have four sofas.
[250:18.97]Nobody else?
[250:26.99]Can I sell to here?
[250:28.73]Maybe?
[250:36.17]Okay, yep.
[250:46.71]I got a thousand bucks.
[250:47.91]I'm getting there.
[250:53.40]Okay.
[250:55.00]Alright, not bad.
[250:57.84]Not bad.
[250:58.96]Let's go.
[251:15.72]How are these doing?
[251:21.53]Is it time?
[251:23.17]Two days.
[251:23.63]I need more fertilizer.
[251:24.96]Three days.
[251:25.38]I don't... Do I have any more?
[251:28.76]I think I have two more bags.
[251:30.36]Should be alright.
[251:30.82]Yep.
[251:46.79]Can I cook the meat?
[251:53.62]Okay, it's time.
[251:57.62]I didn't go to the tool store!
[252:02.54]Where's total tools?
[252:03.54]I'm going to bring most stuff to sell.
[252:20.43]Also, I just want to get rid of
[252:23.72]I'll bring these.
[252:24.38]I'm going to do disk stuff.
[252:26.60]Bring the shit to give to the mayor.
[252:27.76]That sounds so fucking weird out of context.
[252:44.91]This can all stay.
[252:45.99]Alright, that's all I want to do.
[252:51.35]Keep the rest of this crap.
[252:54.30]Okay.
[252:55.96]Total tools.
[252:56.84]Hurry.
[252:57.12]Alright.
[253:06.85]The mayor.
[253:15.77]He's gonna just get pissed.
[253:20.43]The mayor's not even here.
[253:29.33]Put this shit under his desk.
[253:40.96]Okay.
[253:42.50]Alright, tools.
[253:45.98]Time to finally cut down a big tree.
[253:47.30]It only took four and a half hours to do it.
[253:59.43]Alright, what do you got?
[254:01.85]You're not the right place.
[254:03.13]Total tools!
[254:03.86]There we go.
[254:10.97]Oh.
[254:12.41]Weird?
[254:12.73]Okay.
[254:29.95]What else do you have?
[254:31.83]Balloons?
[254:33.03]Fireworks?
[254:33.63]I just want one.
[254:42.77]What is it?
[254:43.15]What can I do with this?
[254:44.83]Should I buy that too?
[254:45.77]Okay.
[254:56.98]If chat was a person, who would they be?
[255:02.21]um alright you know the the chimpanzees that are in the chimpanzees react to magic videos that's who you would that's who chat would be
[255:23.60]Oh, you know what?
[255:24.44]It's a few different, like, factions, right?
[255:27.94]That's probably, like, 30 to 40% of chat.
[255:30.63]Maybe 30%.
[255:31.67]Maybe 40%.
[255:32.01]Okay, so... I'm ready to make this stupid thing.
[255:52.15]Here we go.
[255:55.31]Finally, I have a new weapon.
[255:58.45]Alright.
[255:59.53]Let's go.
[256:01.21]Cut a big tree down.
[256:02.06]Finally.
[256:03.04]Bronze axe.
[256:06.46]I need a bunch of hardwood.
[256:07.50]And then I can do the bridge.
[256:14.44]Hardwood?
[256:16.58]There we go.
[256:17.35]Alright.
[256:18.05]Hell yeah.
[256:19.91]Now we start playing.
[256:33.64]One million follower milk chug, please.
[256:35.82]This looks really dodgeable.
[256:54.54]I swear, I promise you one day, I will hire someone.
[256:59.43]I will hire a weapons expert, like martial artist.
[257:04.91]Somebody that has a black belt and somebody that's a weapons expert.
[257:08.89]And I'm going to give them an axe.
[257:10.91]Not a real one, but I'm going to give them a big foam axe.
[257:14.56]And I'm going to be like, get me.
[257:21.26]It's not going to happen.
[257:41.76]They're gonna murder you.
[257:42.66]No, they won't.
[257:43.66]I'm telling you.
[257:44.82]You know, I love to prove people wrong when it comes to this kind of thing.
[257:57.98]A local streamer in the hospital was so adamant over years telling his chatroom that he'd be able to dodge someone trying to kill him with an axe that he went and proved it at this martial arts studio.
[258:11.76]Within seconds of starting the bid, Mr. Elbertson took the ax directly to the forehead, causing him to black out immediately.
[258:38.67]When reached for comment in the hospital, Mr. Elbertson said no comment.
[258:43.93]He refused to do an interview.
[259:03.17]You would just double down if that happened.
[259:06.06]I'd be like, yeah, we're gonna do this again.
[259:08.18]But he's gonna have a bigger axe.
[259:18.79]Okay, can I start this?
[259:20.01]I got hardwood, right?
[259:21.05]Hardwood planks.
[259:27.49]I'll wake up in the morning and I will be able to do the bridge.
[259:30.98]Sweet.
[259:31.16]Sweet.
[259:41.43]The real Jerma could have done it.
[259:45.02]I'm telling you, I think I could do it.
[259:49.68]It wouldn't be a problem.
[260:00.50]Finally, here we go.
[260:01.44]Bridge.
[260:04.48]Why do I have to be holding it?
[260:06.18]Come on, really?
[260:06.88]Like, it's in my inventory.
[260:14.78]Alright, I need two of these.
[260:22.86]Copper... What was it?
[260:25.22]Copper pipes.
[260:25.86]I have three more of those.
[260:26.86]I need more of this.
[260:36.65]Where are the copper pipes?
[260:40.15]And sell them, right?
[260:43.31]No.
[260:43.45]No.
[260:48.23]Okay, we're good
[261:16.31]Can't wait for the bridge to be done in six hours.
[261:18.90]It's a long process, this game.
[261:21.26]It's a long process.
[261:32.18]Why am I holding a coffin?
[261:33.18]I need five of these.
[261:36.97]When's it going to be done?
[261:38.99]A long time.
[261:39.93]Alright, so now...
[261:42.65]Give Gael the Day of the Bright Sun gift.
[261:46.89]How about no?
[261:47.43]Alright, organization time.
[261:57.55]Let's go.
[261:58.78]I'm renaming this.
[261:59.60]This is going to be called Materials.
[262:14.93]This is technically a material.
[262:17.89]Material.
[262:18.95]Material.
[262:19.69]Material.
[262:21.07]Material.
[262:22.47]This is a material.
[262:25.41]This is... This is just all a bunch of weird shit.
[262:28.40]I don't know what it is.
[262:29.90]Resin?
[262:30.74]Not a build material.
[262:33.64]Oh, cool.
[262:33.96]Hold on.
[262:43.19]Can I not play with the firework?
[262:44.75]I can't use the firework.
[262:57.86]Okay.
[262:58.96]I need a lighter.
[262:59.58]Alright, so materials.
[263:04.95]Let's put the copper in there, right?
[263:07.03]Just building material shit.
[263:25.32]Damage increase, defense, max health.
[263:33.02]As well as upgrade the axe one.
[263:38.86]Ooh, these ready?
[263:41.86]One more day.
[263:47.01]Why are you pretending to care about the game?
[263:48.53]I don't know.
[263:51.56]I'm just playing.
[263:53.12]I'm just chilling.
[263:57.64]I'm kind of sick and I'm just relaxing with all of you.
[264:00.56]We're just having a good time.
[264:04.43]Tourist.
[264:06.99]This is the game that we're just chilling with, man.
[264:08.77]We're just chilling.
[264:11.57]We're just going to hang out.
[264:13.06]That's what we're doing.
[264:22.72]Alright.
[264:23.64]How much is the bridge body?
[264:27.52]Does the bridge body need hardwood?
[264:28.82]Because if it is, I have to go cut trees down.
[264:32.46]The bridge body is bronze plates.
[264:35.78]And bricks.
[264:38.00]Okay.
[264:40.30]So I need more... I think I have enough bronze bars.
[264:42.92]Bronze plates.
[264:43.61]Okay.
[264:53.43]Not really.
[264:59.98]If I had more fuel... Is that going to keep going?
[265:03.74]Alright, I got two.
[265:04.66]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[265:05.74]I've got enough.
[265:07.48]Refuel.
[265:09.60]Refuel.
[265:11.91]Refuel.
[265:14.65]Alright, these things are good to go.
[265:15.67]I'll have a bunch of bronze bars, which I can make bronze plates.
[265:19.45]Let's cut down some more hardwood.
[265:39.60]Stop!
[265:46.40]Can't get that.
[265:47.02]I got a bird's nest?
[266:12.02]Play Five Nuts at Freddy's 2.
[266:13.22]There was a huge opportunity for you guys to have me play that game, but you just... You didn't get to the right threshold.
[266:20.06]Did I kill this crab?
[266:27.93]I can't even step in... How deep is this water?
[266:36.87]What?
[266:37.23]I just did it!
[266:39.41]Oh, no, I didn't.
[266:51.16]A lot of trees over there.
[266:52.08]Alright.
[266:53.34]Almost there.
[267:01.88]This is the first major milestone to get to the next area.
[267:08.27]I was only going to be live for like three hours today, but I still feel okay.
[267:12.27]I think this is a good setup.
[267:19.16]Every time I do that, I cough, essentially.
[267:34.38]I'm doing alright, though.
[267:35.10]Okay, how many more hardwood planks do I need?
[267:42.03]I need one more hardwood plank.
[267:44.21]And then I can keep this rolling.
[267:45.65]Alright, but I need to make these plates, right?
[267:48.61]Bronze plates.
[267:56.36]I'm assuming it's probably from here, right?
[267:59.32]Yep.
[268:08.70]Okay.
[268:12.10]Uh, yeah, I got enough, so I cancel this.
[268:19.42]How many plates do I need?
[268:20.28]Alright, there's that.
[268:25.89]Almost done.
[268:28.45]Bridge head.
[268:32.81]Three bronze plates and three stone bricks.
[268:54.95]No.
[269:03.70]Wow, I need more than that.
[269:05.55]Okay, I need a lot more stone bricks.
[269:21.61]Is it only three plates?
[269:22.57]Because I don't need to do all this.
[269:25.21]I can put bricks here instead.
[269:29.70]Yeah, we'll do bricks instead here.
[269:32.98]I need these more.
[269:33.60]Alright, now he's going to wait and go to bed.
[269:39.84]Back into the mine, maybe?
[269:40.58]What do you think?
[269:41.86]Do I need more stone?
[269:44.88]Hydration check?
[269:45.64]I got it right here.
[269:54.09]Jerma, do you want your blankie and teddy?
[270:01.95]You freaking freaking me out, man.
[270:06.07]Uh, should I go to bed?
[270:07.76]Should I just go to sleep?
[270:12.40]What do you think?
[270:17.56]Why can't I just take this corn?
[270:18.94]It's right here.
[270:24.65]Is there any other quests I can do?
[270:26.89]The spi- Alright, I'm gonna go investigate the spine thing.
[270:29.21]Somebody said it's the east.
[270:31.53]I'm gonna go check it out.
[270:33.83]Maybe- Why not?
[270:41.44]At the- I'm looking for spines, because that'll give me some more money.
[270:57.15]Please don't turn the cam off.
[270:58.35]I can't handle being alone for more than five seconds.
[271:01.35]Dude!
[271:03.76]What the fuck?
[271:09.16]This goofy-ass sign.
[271:27.98]Oh, a sea urchin.
[271:28.64]Alright.
[271:29.02]There's a sea urchin.
[271:29.52]But who's this cereal mascot over here?
[271:37.86]Papa bear?
[271:38.72]Oh, oh, oh.
[272:01.15]Oh, what do bears like?
[272:03.13]Dried apple slices?
[272:04.91]Oh, wait, it shows down here.
[272:06.49]You want... Oh, you hate all this stuff.
[272:09.77]Do you like, um... Do you like... It's tree sap.
[272:12.57]Honey?
[272:13.55]I have honey, don't I?
[272:21.92]Oh, you like that?
[272:29.40]It's the... Yeah, it is.
[272:31.38]No, don't... Do not throw a firework.
[272:35.53]Alright, I need to get these urchins.
[272:57.55]I need ten spines.
[272:58.41]Sounds like Link.
[273:17.34]I can do this in another five minutes, it's fine.
[273:30.35]Oh my god.
[273:31.19]Dude, I can't even... It's like GTA 3.
[273:41.75]Come on.
[273:59.84]Why do they have a balloon urchin?
[274:01.43]That's weird.
[274:06.53]Oh!
[274:14.76]I'm just eating meat?
[274:16.12]I just ate 20 steaks.
[274:17.46]What?
[274:17.70]I didn't know I even had that many.
[274:20.14]Where did I get all that?
[274:37.10]What?
[274:38.58]Come on.
[274:39.26]I had 20 stakes, too.
[274:49.97]Give me a fucking break.
[274:55.31]Okay.
[274:57.25]Well, whatever.
[275:03.50]I need a few more of these bricks.
[275:05.98]This should be fine.
[275:06.98]In the morning, I'll be able to do most of the bridge.
[275:09.22]That was dumb.
[275:11.66]Minus 2,000 gamer points.
[275:37.68]It's okay, I'll get them back.
[275:44.64]I love the way they look when they're stacked up.
[275:47.43]This is a pistachio Hershey's.
[275:49.55]My favorite flavor.
[275:50.47]Alright, bronze plate.
[276:07.20]Shit, I need more of those.
[276:09.40]Three more.
[276:09.84]I can only make... I should get it here.
[276:25.01]How many do I need for a...
[276:35.06]Because that's making one.
[276:36.28]This is making two.
[276:37.82]No, I'll definitely have enough for one more.
[276:38.91]Alright.
[276:44.31]Well, I got to go back to this.
[276:45.45]I have to go get back and do that.
[276:48.48]I got triple tapped by a balloon urchin and it killed me instantly.
[277:02.11]My son won't talk to me after I suggested to watch your streams.
[277:05.39]What do I do?
[277:12.53]You should tell your son that there's lots of great streamers on twitch.tv.
[277:19.82]And that he can find whoever he wants to watch on his own.
[277:24.32]And you don't have to tell him what streamers to watch.
[277:47.79]Tell him to watch the green screen stream.
[277:49.25]He might like that one!
[278:11.08]We're good.
[278:12.46]Okay, I've got the materials.
[278:15.09]Umbrellas are important, so I can bring those to you.
[278:17.56]Let's try this in.
[278:32.10]What's this guy again?
[278:33.16]Can I give you something else?
[278:39.94]Meat?
[278:41.70]Alright, you kind of liked it.
[278:50.06]What would you do if you woke up in this world tomorrow?
[278:55.14]I mean, this world's really not that different than the world that we live in right now.
[278:59.56]Why is it so different?
[279:04.16]There's not that many differences.
[279:06.30]There's not that big of a difference.
[279:14.45]What's the big difference?
[279:15.25]There's no TV?
[279:19.36]I mean, this wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[279:21.08]Portia.
[279:24.50]Let's give that motherfucker a bird's nest.
[279:54.48]Oh, thanks.
[279:55.32]Thank you.
[279:58.42]Appreciate it.
[280:00.04]Just be known as the weird guy in town.
[280:05.87]He hands out raw meat to people of birds' nests.
[280:10.57]He thinks he's mining copper and bronze bars, but they're just thin mints.
[280:19.23]He's a weird guy.
[280:20.15]Alright, one more.
[280:40.34]Come on.
[280:41.00]Yes!
[280:42.24]Wait, is that enough?
[280:44.96]It's not enough.
[280:45.54]I need another bronze bar.
[280:51.90]Oh, thank god.
[280:52.68]Okay, I'm good.
[281:01.33]Let's go build the bridge.
[281:03.63]I better get, like, five grand for this.
[281:05.41]Okay.
[281:07.32]Okay, bam bam.
[281:09.70]Uh, we're gonna go to the bridge.
[281:32.10]Would it ever happen to me strong?
[281:34.72]I know.
[281:35.94]Maybe I'll do me strong one day.
[281:40.98]Where I just get high and play Elden Ring as a strength-only character and I can't have anything besides a club.
[281:51.87]Trust me, I want to do it.
[281:59.51]There it is.
[282:02.01]Build the bridge.
[282:04.25]Now who do I talk to?
[282:05.07]Report to... Okay.
[282:07.76]Bridge is done.
[282:08.94]Nice.
[282:10.28]Progress.
[282:23.15]Strength build is really good now, too.
[282:24.79]Yeah.
[282:28.46]Every time I think about that idea... Oh, wow, that's... I don't know.
[282:31.66]I don't want to make it like a... Oh, look at them.
[282:35.78]Look at how fun drugs are.
[282:36.94]That's not the intention of that stream.
[282:47.72]Where do I want to go?
[282:54.43]Oh, they're in the town hall.
[283:03.28]You're a good lad.
[283:04.22]Yeah, we'll see.
[283:07.24]There's probably a way I can do that without... I don't know.
[283:19.27]I have a gift that you want?
[283:22.77]What does he want?
[283:26.97]He has something that... I have something he wants.
[283:31.05]What is it?
[283:35.70]Oh, this is the mayor.
[283:36.90]Right.
[283:37.22]Okay.
[283:37.58]I don't have... Are you kidding me?
[283:41.10]I don't think anyone would like such a gift.
[283:43.78]Everyone.
[283:44.78]I'm sure the celebrations for the Day of the Bright Sun are a bit different in Barnabas.
[283:50.76]Here, the airship tradition has been going on for almost 40 years.
[283:55.63]I think it started when someone jumped on the peach statue and started throwing cranberry candy at everybody.
[284:08.33]I just handed this guy just animal shit.
[284:12.85]What was that for?
[284:13.55]Builder.
[284:13.71]What's cross five?
[284:14.94]What?
[284:38.65]Oh, okay, so this is just Connect 4.
[284:46.89]What?
[284:47.95]Oh, I get it.
[284:48.45]Okay, let's try it again.
[285:50.16]What?
[285:50.58]How?
[285:51.08]Where?
[286:56.60]Fuck off.
[287:05.14]What?!
[287:08.12]Who cares about this?
[287:09.30]You know what I mean?
[287:10.09]Who gives a shit about... The AI is just designed to beat you every time.
[287:15.09]I don't care about this.
[287:18.71]I don't give a shit.
[287:22.57]It's Kinect 4 with like a million other pieces.
[287:47.58]Oh!
[288:28.21]Fuck!
[288:51.18]The birds are freaking out.
[288:55.92]Dude, I don't ever, I hate shit like this.
[288:59.48]I hate checkers.
[289:02.06]I hate chess.
[289:03.52]I hate whatever this is called.
[289:08.59]Whatever ball this is.
[289:09.65]I don't, I hate them.
[289:19.71]And this guy, this is like, this computer player is just designed to beat you.
[289:36.62]You're losing to beginner AI.
[289:38.53]No, it's just dumb!
[289:45.07]Get this fucking controller away from me.
[289:47.17]Okay, here we go.
[290:03.14]He just knows my every move!
[290:04.52]He knows my every move!
[290:09.67]Thank you.
[290:43.50]Oh
[291:13.53]What?
[291:13.83]What do you mean it's getting late?
[291:35.13]I'm not done.
[291:59.02]Aim a hairdryer... Aim a hairdryer at your CPU to slow the CPU down.
[292:10.38]That shit's hard.
[292:11.42]I hate that fucking dumb game.
[292:15.64]Fuck that stupid ass game, man.
[292:18.99]That game's stupid.
[292:19.99]We don't even need to... Who cares about that?
[292:24.70]Oh, no, I can't play... Whatever the fuck it is.
[292:29.90]Bocce ball, whatever it is.
[292:32.64]Cheat, what's it called?
[292:37.21]I'm going back and I'm... Where the fuck is that guy?
[292:48.91]Reversi!
[292:49.81]No, what am I... Backgammon, not...
[292:58.72]I'm thinking of backgammon.
[293:06.60]Whatever, who cares?
[293:07.37]That's a stupid game.
[293:15.23]It's just the board is so huge.
[293:16.93]It's called Go.
[293:18.50]Okay, so here we go.
[293:29.68]It's Goku.
[293:34.38]What is it?
[293:39.52]Oh, that's 1800 gold.
[293:42.80]I just made 1800 gold.
[293:44.11]150 gold?
[293:50.15]Nope.
[293:50.39]I don't get out of bed for anything less than 500.
[293:53.53]Nope.
[293:57.35]Fuck all of you.
[294:06.79]That's alright, I got cash.
[294:11.71]I'm glad you returned to YouTuber's life.
[294:13.83]It does kind of look similar, doesn't it?
[294:17.29]Except, I would say this game is way better.
[294:28.50]Ooh, these are ready.
[294:29.88]Aren't they?
[294:30.98]Yep.
[294:31.84]Harvest.

[295:10.94]Oh, I need to just craft planter boxes.
[295:12.70]I got you.
[295:14.70]Still haven't met this person.
[295:26.17]More damage.
[295:26.65]I can probably sell the wheat, right?
[295:35.75]Makes sense.
[295:38.58]Go back to that shithead Isaac and get your win.
[295:43.08]No, I don't think I can beat that game.
[295:45.30]I genuinely don't think I can do it.
[295:48.32]I genuinely don't think I can.
[295:49.82]Come on, I gotta pee.

[298:33.59]This dude's a vegan furry.
[298:35.37]Did you just say that or am I making that up?
[298:47.49]I don't know why... Why did I say that?
[298:49.65]What did somebody say?
[298:52.57]Somebody said something close.
[298:59.00]I thought somebody said, dude, you're a fucking, what are you, a vegan furry?
[299:02.24]I was like, no, but who said that?
[299:18.47]Somebody said that.
[299:22.73]Why would I have said anything?
[299:29.34]Why would I just say that for no reason?
[299:32.10]This guy is a fucking creep.
[299:35.82]Alright.
[299:36.68]What... Alright.
[299:37.62]What am I doing?

[303:13.89]When you're talking about a donut that's just moist.
[303:16.03]It's not even necessary.
[303:18.13]I would take a water with this.
[303:19.67]Yeah, that's how good this is.
[303:21.37]Alright, we'll have to go home.
