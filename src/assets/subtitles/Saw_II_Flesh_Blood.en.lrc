[00:00.81]Oh, he's early.
[00:01.55]He loves us.
[00:04.39]Just saw that.
[00:06.85]You're right.
[00:08.36]It's a true statement.
[00:11.14]Aye.
[00:13.88]I have tears in my eyes.
[00:15.60]I'm crying right now.
[00:20.10]VOD watchers skip 25 minutes.
[00:23.93]Don't.
[00:25.45]Don't do that.
[00:28.66]There's no reason for you to do that today.
[00:30.10]We're not stalling today.
[00:32.28]There's no chubby bunny today.
[00:44.65]Enable people ween right now.
[00:47.39]No.
[00:52.41]VOD watchers, don't skip.
[00:54.19]He's about to do a cinnamon challenge.
[00:58.80]You mean the videos where I take a gigantic spoon and just place the gigantic spoon of cinnamon in my mouth and instantly just spit it all out all over my kitchen?
[01:12.31]And I foam all around my mouth while I scream?
[01:17.86]No, that's not worth it.
[01:18.90]I don't want to clean my kitchen.
[01:22.40]What you guys don't know is when that video turns off,
[01:25.90]That person has to spend the next probably three hours getting every grain of cinnamon off their fucking kitchen counter.
[01:32.09]And off the floor.
[01:33.15]And then they have to wash the floor.
[01:37.03]And then they upload the video.
[01:39.37]And if the video doesn't get enough revenue for that to have been worth them destroying their kitchen, they gotta up the game.
[01:45.53]They gotta up the ante again tomorrow.
[01:52.41]Yo, first stream caught on time?
[01:54.51]What's your name?
[01:56.33]Hey, Fanto.
[01:58.26]Thanks for the sub.
[02:00.30]Oh, they're not subbed.
[02:01.12]Hey, thanks for watching.
[02:02.40]Thanks for the watch.
[02:04.26]Hey, thanks for the watch.
[02:04.96]I can't believe you gave me a Rolex.
[02:06.43]This guy's crazy.
[02:07.31]Yeah, we're gonna play Saw II.
[02:10.43]It's been long enough.
[02:14.40]I'm playing Saw 2 in the first week of Halloween.
[02:16.90]Well, the only week of Halloween.
[02:19.30]We're starting the week of Halloween with Saw 2 because I just want to get it out of the way so that I don't have to look over the chat and see the next four straight days.
[02:28.23]Three straight days.
[02:30.85]Hey, where's Saw?
[02:32.45]Where's Saw, dude?
[02:33.07]You're supposed to be playing Saw right now.
[02:34.75]How come he's not playing Saw?
[02:36.17]When is Saw?
[02:37.79]We're doing it first.
[02:42.63]Three days of Saw in a row.
[02:44.15]No.
[02:45.91]I would be, I'll tell you right now, I would be shocked.
[02:49.39]Electrocuted, even.
[02:52.13]If we play this tomorrow.
[02:55.21]I have to make a prediction.
[02:56.15]I feel like this is an electrocution stream.
[03:01.09]I'd be shocked if this turns on tomorrow.
[03:04.03]This game.
[03:07.19]I would put the screen over to the game.
[03:10.97]But I'm not going to do that yet because it's flashing red and it's horrible to look at.
[03:15.47]I don't want to just... It's terrible.
[03:19.08]It's awful to look at.
[03:19.78]So I don't want to make you suffer.
[03:26.24]Enable facecam.
[03:27.26]No.
[03:28.08]Saw 2?
[03:28.90]Why do you need that?
[03:29.56]There's no scary moment in this.
[03:32.54]Hey, thank you.
[03:33.24]Chlor the Terrifier.
[03:36.94]Five community subs, thank you.
[03:40.74]Do it, do it.
[03:41.66]No, no, no.
[03:46.23]Why are you playing the sequel, you fucking Looney Tune?
[03:50.15]You know how much this was demanded of me for the last three or four months?
[04:04.89]I'm not going to veto this.
[04:08.07]Do you know how hard this game is to find?
[04:10.09]This is a rare ass game.
[04:17.12]I think as of right now, only one of these is for sale.
[04:21.14]As of this moment right now.
[04:23.28]There is one copy of Saw II for sale on the internet.
[04:27.94]Just saying.
[04:28.96]Pretty rare.
[04:36.38]Look, I'm going to warn you, this actually is horrible to look at.
[04:38.70]Here it comes.
[04:48.73]You thought you could really get rid of me?
[04:51.49]Hello, chat.
[04:53.39]How are you?
[04:55.25]Are you ready to be bombarded with fucking Sudoku puzzles?
[04:59.19]Because that's what's going to happen.
[05:04.59]I guarantee you this whole game is full of glorified crossword puzzles.
[05:12.32]Make your choice.
[05:17.06]I can't look.
[05:17.56]Yeah, it sucks to look at.
[05:18.42]Alright, you guys ready?
[05:22.04]Ready to do this?
[05:28.86]We're in the helmet.
[05:32.37]By the way, how is it possible that Saw 2 looks worse than Saw 1?
[05:37.23]Is that weird?
[05:44.30]I'm not playing on insane mode.
[05:45.70]That's dumb.
[05:50.02]Why would I ever pick insane mode for Saw 2?
[05:52.38]That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[05:56.53]Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[06:00.97]Logan, Michael.
[06:06.10]Okay, I'm gonna stop.
[06:07.04]I can't abuse that today.
[06:15.40]Wait, what?
[06:15.88]Is that a mirror?
[06:20.82]What was he looking at?
[06:22.08]Why was that just a VR cam?
[06:23.72]Like a third-person VR cam?
[06:26.38]Here it comes!
[06:26.68]Shh!
[06:42.75]All drug addicts?
[06:54.18]Your impression is better.
[06:55.76]This is actually the guy that is Jigsaw.
[07:00.28]Oh, I hate eyeball stuff.
[07:01.74]X. X. X. Tap X?
[07:06.57]Tap X to stab yourself in eye?
[07:14.53]Wait, I missed?
[07:17.63]Wait, why?
[07:17.97]It didn't even tell me what to do.
[07:19.05]Oh, oh, oh, Campbell, Campbell, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[07:23.16]Don't do that, don't do that.
[07:25.52]When I try to... Inside your eye, there's a key.
[07:27.16]Oh, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell.
[07:30.02]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[07:30.96]It's in your stomach.
[07:32.48]Oh, Campbell.
[07:37.03]Oh, this is fucking disgusting.
[07:40.92]Oh, I did it.
[08:07.51]Wait, do you get to play as Saw this time?
[08:09.39]Imagine you get to play as Saw and make traps.
[08:12.47]That would be so much better.
[08:13.69]How do I get out of here?
[08:20.00]I gotta turn the audio up for me.
[08:21.38]It's so low.
[08:23.90]It's so low.
[08:30.51]Come on, do it.
[08:38.92]There, I can hear it now.
[08:39.96]Alright, so we walk.
[08:46.83]Where do we- Oh, okay.
[08:47.93]Walk here.
[08:48.43]That really hurt.
[08:51.87]When you are injured, find a health hypodermic and use it on yourself to suppress the pain.
[08:55.81]After finding a health hypodermic, press L1 to use it.
[08:59.71]This will restore your health.
[09:00.71]Okay.
[09:03.49]I'm walking around really casually right now.
[09:08.18]Just like the last game, right?
[09:11.50]How is this one different, you think?
[09:13.12]Now is the time to take a hard look.
[09:15.92]I thought it just said eat yourself.
[09:21.12]Escape from the basement.
[09:25.56]First puzzle of the afternoon.
[09:27.49]I can't wait.
[09:28.47]It's a little puzzle video game.
[09:31.69]Wow.
[09:32.83]Look around.
[09:35.01]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[09:36.47]Alright, select and rotate.
[09:37.95]Yeah, fun.
[09:43.29]Another one of Saw's terrible children's puzzles.
[09:53.11]Uh.
[09:56.81]Wait, look around.
[09:57.51]Look around for what?
[10:05.65]Having a blast here, ResidentSleeper.
[10:07.99]Just let me do the puzzle, and then we'll get to eat... We'll get to eat somebody this game.
[10:11.55]I saw the review.
[10:15.00]Oh, I get it.
[10:15.56]Okay.
[10:16.56]It's gonna match.
[10:24.56]I saw... I read the review of Saw 2.
[10:26.89]Like, the... One of the reviewers was like, it was really, like, interesting.
[10:29.65]It was kind of a fun game until the interactive eat-the-guy sequence.
[10:32.87]It was just sickening.
[10:34.01]So, I mean, we're gonna get there eventually, I think.
[10:47.23]Oh, I didn't know that was on him.
[10:48.49]I guessed that.
[10:49.69]You now have a flashlight that can be used to illuminate dark areas.
[10:52.89]Okay, cool.
[10:55.89]I actually didn't know that was on his chest.
[10:57.25]Alright, so I illuminate dark areas.
[10:59.45]Escape from Jigsaw's workshop.
[11:05.24]Okay, just as long as there's no shotgun traps, I could care less.
[11:08.72]Saw blade?
[11:09.38]Okay, why can I see that?
[11:17.89]I touch items and I can see what their use is?
[11:21.19]I don't get it.
[11:24.09]Pendulum blade.
[11:27.31]You're a psychic.
[11:29.83]Is that really what this is?
[11:32.69]Combination lock.
[11:34.01]Wonderful.
[11:34.63]I can't wait to do this a thousand times.
[11:36.99]We're going to do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[11:38.62]Alright, that combination is Impaler.
[11:47.16]That's a car.
[11:47.48]This is from the first game.
[11:51.61]We did that to the first guy.
[11:55.69]You can say code.
[11:57.67]Look for code.
[12:00.34]Chevy Impaler.
[12:01.54]You can see, but do you understand, Campbell?
[12:05.52]Oh, shit.
[12:12.35]Sorry, the Nickelodeon glow-in-the-dark pen was only supposed to show up.
[12:19.27]Fuck.
[12:19.55]It's okay, it's 573.
[12:20.31]Just fuck off, go to the next room, okay?
[12:33.22]Five, seven, three.
[12:34.56]I got the- Hey, I brute force the first part.
[12:44.41]Or the last part.
[12:48.49]What?
[12:55.70]Okay.
[12:57.24]That wouldn't kill you.
[12:59.13]I don't think that would kill you.
[13:00.59]I'm pretty sure you would fucking not be hurt by that.
[13:03.91]You would probably stub your toe or bend your knee the wrong way.
[13:13.48]Wouldn't you just twist your ankle?
[13:15.50]Oh, there were spikes down there.
[13:17.03]Imagine setting that up.
[13:23.47]Okay, if you're setting that up, you can fucking fall down there and die yourself, can't you?
[13:27.70]If it's that easy?
[13:28.56]That'd be so horrible.
[13:30.68]Imagine putting the planks up here.
[13:35.42]Okay, just be careful.
[13:36.74]Don't fall flat in.
[13:40.98]Okay, so tap X. Stupid.
[13:50.64]I still don't think that would hurt you that much.
[13:54.55]You would get a little messed up, I think, but you would get maybe cut, like your stomach might get cut, but why would you land flat on your face?
[14:03.09]You would land kind of on your feet a little bit and go down to a knee.
[14:05.69]You might scrape a knee or two.
[14:06.77]Okay, explore for an exit.
[14:10.71]Pipe.
[14:11.47]Check.
[14:13.05]Alright, what's R2, L2?
[14:15.81]Smash.
[14:17.83]How about I just swing it on my own?
[14:29.29]Okay.
[14:31.33]I don't get to use it?
[14:40.20]Uh-oh.
[14:45.06]What happened to that guy?
[14:49.78]Oh, he got killed by one of these hydraulic murder traps.
[14:56.77]He was just trying to get back in to watch Trebonat85 stream.
[15:00.73]He just took a piss.
[15:03.27]Thank you.
[15:03.53]I'll take the plus twos.
[15:04.33]Thank you.
[15:05.09]Thank you.
[15:05.35]Alright, so now what?
[15:13.30]Can I get in here?
[15:18.52]Oh, this way.
[15:24.26]Broken fence.
[15:25.12]What the fuck is that?
[15:26.74]L2R2?
[15:28.88]You have to crawl around first person?
[15:31.18]Oh.
[15:32.79]That would have been so much more amazing if the rat came and started biting my face in first person.
[15:39.39]Get me on a team.
[15:40.01]You know what I mean?
[15:40.79]Get me on the team.
[15:41.63]I would put that in.
[15:42.65]I'd make sure it was in.
[15:43.33]If I was like the creative director of the game, that sequence would go by and I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:48.39]That rat comes and starts biting your face.
[15:51.03]How did you fuck that up?
[15:59.56]Okay.
[16:00.36]Wait.
[16:01.36]Oh, there's a pig face.
[16:07.42]Where are we?
[16:08.94]By the way.
[16:11.98]We're like outside, inside, outside, underground, above ground, inside.
[16:16.02]I don't get it.
[16:16.46]Where are we?
[16:16.90]What building is this?
[16:20.30]You're in my house.
[16:21.48]Oh, cool.
[16:22.02]That's so cool.
[16:25.24]Without a record of your game, nobody will know your fate.
[16:28.14]Save your game by approaching the old tape recorder and pressing X. So what, every time I get to one of these, I describe the last thing that happened?
[16:36.58]Okay.
[16:44.61]Why not just carry it around?
[16:45.75]Podcast Saw.
[16:54.69]That's so dumb.
[16:55.39]Alright, I got a nail and a hypodermic.
[16:56.75]I'm just gonna call it a needle because I don't like the word hypodermic is hard to say.
[17:02.19]Hypodermic.
[17:03.56]It feels like the word that there's too many things in the word.
[17:05.70]Alright, pick the lock to the door.
[17:07.00]Sure.
[17:07.12]Can I answer the phone?
[17:13.08]You found one of the 25.
[17:14.48]I gotta answer the phone.
[17:16.36]Where's the phone?
[17:25.31]Okay, what the fuck is going on?
[17:28.32]What?
[17:29.40]Did I just hit my face?
[17:31.16]Did it crush my eye?
[17:32.20]What the hell?
[17:39.98]You have to actually, like, Millennium Falcon this thing?
[17:43.44]That's so stupid.
[17:45.80]I'm gonna hate that after an hour.
[17:49.85]You leave him alone.
[18:00.25]his his story repeats itself his history repeats itself hey his story and history I mean the game's about the last guy I press square instead yeah it does it sure does repeat itself
[18:30.24]They replaced shotguns with stomach knives.
[18:34.16]That's great.
[18:34.76]Okay, cool.
[18:35.26]Let's go.
[18:41.32]Where's the phone?
[18:52.33]I fucking hate this already.
[18:53.61]I don't want to do this one.
[18:55.03]I don't want to.
[18:55.47]This is worse than the... You understand that eventually.
[18:59.61]This is just the fun little tutorial.
[19:01.26]There's going to be locks that are four miles long.
[19:05.58]The door is going to be 40 feet wide and like 25 feet long.
[19:10.20]It's going to be pain in the ass and you know it.
[19:16.10]It's going to be a huge thick ass door later on.
[19:26.12]What the?!
[19:27.32]There was a- I looked at chat, I didn't see it.
[19:40.00]Alright, so, Saw 2, they've added you do two quick time events to stop the thing from killing you when you open the door.
[19:45.51]Okay.
[19:45.65]Okay.
[19:54.34]Who cares about the puzzle piece?
[19:56.06]This is dog shit stuff we're not even going to watch.
[19:59.18]Do it again.
[19:59.62]Here we go.
[20:00.16]I don't want to do it.
[20:06.68]I just want to open the door.
[20:18.38]You may be wondering if it gets worse and they put those everywhere.
[20:21.12]Yes to both.
[20:21.86]Okay, great.
[20:22.50]Yeah, I can't wait to play it.
[20:25.50]X triangle.
[20:27.14]It's square.
[20:29.22]Okay, I was gonna say there's no way that fucking kills me.
[20:31.12]Why would they kill me?
[20:34.29]Alright, squeeze.
[20:42.84]Wait, hold on.
[20:44.72]There's a room with a timer.
[20:47.83]Wait, are we missing it?
[20:48.93]Where'd the window go?
[20:51.26]Oh, he closed the windows on me.
[20:52.70]This flashlight is terrible.
[20:55.82]Why does this flashlight only go one foot in front of my face?
[21:02.15]Wouldn't I be able to see it on that wall?
[21:05.34]This is the worst flashlight I've ever seen.
[21:14.38]Earthquake.
[21:15.04]Wait.
[21:15.32]No.
[21:15.52]Somebody.
[21:15.92]Hey.
[21:16.89]Don't step on that.
[21:17.91]It's rigged.
[21:20.75]You're going to fall down here.
[21:21.59]You're going to sprain your ankle like I did.
[21:22.89]I was trying to tell you.
[21:29.91]And now he's crushed under all that rubble.
[21:39.18]Run for your life.
[21:41.20]Oh.
[21:42.37]To alter your movement speed, hold down R1.
[21:44.51]Running can save your life, but will make some events more difficult to survive.
[21:51.21]Well, I don't really need to run for my life now, do I?
[21:56.08]Nothing chasing me.
[21:56.92]Pepe left.
[22:08.85]Well, why?
[22:09.27]Is it because it says, watch your step?
[22:10.63]Do I have to run through this door?
[22:13.22]I have to run through and just put my elbows and wrists up and just smash through with my shoulders?
[22:17.28]Stacking the TVs like that.
[22:43.74]It's probably really hard to do that.
[22:47.98]Defeat the rammer.
[22:54.80]Okay.
[22:55.98]You definitely have to ram this door.
[22:57.68]Right?
[23:01.78]What?
[23:05.21]No, you're not.
[23:06.79]You didn't even hit me with your head.
[23:07.99]What does it want me to have him ram?
[23:17.78]Right here?
[23:18.24]I've already seen this scene in Monty Python.
[23:28.87]I know how it ends.
[23:29.59]Oh, come on.
[23:30.99]Can I punch him?
[23:39.87]Oh, over the elevator.
[23:40.89]Have him run.
[23:48.39]You saw me open that.
[23:50.57]He doesn't have his eyes covered.
[23:51.81]Hold on.
[24:05.86]Hold on.
[24:06.52]Let me get this straight.
[24:08.00]You die before you take a step into the fall.
[24:16.22]My front foot got in there and I died before I went in.
[24:20.28]I don't have to do that again, do I?
[24:25.10]Thank God, no.
[24:25.94]I do.
[24:26.38]Fuck.
[24:26.68]Okay, well, I know what to do.
[24:27.83]We'll get it immediately.
[24:32.85]Come on, go in.
[24:45.93]Please.
[24:51.54]Stop.
[24:52.34]Stop.
[24:54.08]Stop.
[24:56.56]Okay, we're good.
[24:57.10]Let's go.
[24:58.64]Defeat the rammer.
[25:06.03]Okay, right or left?
[25:08.21]I'll get the help.
[25:08.79]Hey, by the way, happy Halloween.
[25:13.53]In a week.
[25:14.93]But, hey.
[25:15.77]We're here on Monday.
[25:16.59]It's Halloween week.
[25:18.49]Gonna be checking out some scary games.
[25:19.85]Some games we have not played.
[25:20.99]Gonna be a wild week.
[25:26.53]Why don't you stick around?
[25:33.74]Four o'clock.
[25:34.74]Wait, isn't it four o'clock right now?
[25:35.90]No.
[25:36.94]It's two.
[25:39.94]Is this game as stupid as the last one?
[25:41.28]Yeah, it is.
[25:43.91]It is as stupid as the last one.
[25:46.61]I have to pick out just- you have to just touch every stupid filing cabinet and pick out all the- Oh, coupler!
[25:51.55]Yeah, scissors!
[25:55.86]That's a weird room.
[25:57.24]Alright, what's this?
[26:00.68]Imagine if that was just him.
[26:05.08]He's really, really way smaller.
[26:06.94]That's his chair.
[26:14.57]Hello again, Campbell.
[26:16.99]Yes.
[26:18.23]Let me just stop you right there.
[26:21.17]I know it looks like I'm a small guy in a huge chair, but I'm not sitting in a small chair.
[26:27.73]I get the big chair.
[26:30.12]You think I'm gonna degrade myself and sit in a little chair?
[26:32.36]No.
[26:32.84]You're gonna degrade it inside of your right eye.
[26:38.52]You have a little bit of macular degeneration.
[26:41.86]When I was putting that shit in your eye,
[26:44.43]I noticed.
[26:44.81]You're probably gonna have to go on some CBD.
[26:47.69]It might help.
[26:48.97]Alright, now go to the next room and fuck off.
[26:58.02]Okay, you monster!
[26:59.42]Uh-oh.
[27:15.60]Activate the circuit panel.
[27:21.47]They put it in here.
[27:23.53]It's the same one.
[27:25.23]This is the same game.
[27:25.95]This game sucks.
[27:26.75]I'm about to delete the game.
[27:27.51]I'm about to leave.
[27:38.50]Oh my god.
[27:39.28]It's even more stupid than the last one.
[27:43.45]It's you have to do opposites.
[27:44.59]Is that what this is?
[27:47.89]Yeah, it's like positive and negative.
[27:50.59]Isn't it?
[27:54.19]What?
[28:00.22]How can I move this?
[28:11.68]I already hate this.
[28:13.04]With a passion.
[28:15.16]Okay, so this is- needs to be... Oh my god.
[28:21.19]How did you make this worse than the last game?
[28:36.97]They took the puzzle thing from the last game and they said, hey, make it, make it way fucking worse and even less fun.
[28:46.66]What am I even supposed to be connecting here?
[28:48.70]Just all of them?
[28:51.94]Just red to yellow.
[28:52.88]Yeah, but... This is not even connected to anything.
[29:10.94]And the worst part is I can't switch them because it just bounces you back.
[29:22.92]This sucks.
[29:28.96]I just want to connect it.
[29:34.36]Alright, so this has to be going... Which way does this face?
[29:36.62]Up?
[29:39.54]It doesn't go this way.
[29:43.91]They're magnets?
[29:44.67]I was... I don't... I don't... How the fuck am I supposed to turn this though?
[30:03.73]Nice lightsaber sound.
[30:14.52]Please for the love of God Why let me turn it so I can connect this shit I can't imagine making these
[30:43.28]Stackem's brain.
[30:44.16]This sucks.
[30:45.15]This is stupid.
[30:46.29]Why did they make it even worse?
[31:02.60]Why can I not just spin this around to connect to this?
[31:11.97]Oh my fucking god.
[31:15.58]Why?
[31:16.28]Why can't I just spin this?
[31:17.34]Come up with this.
[31:34.11]I'm so good at making games.
[31:51.20]He's mad.
[31:52.14]This guy's mad.
[31:54.44]He's pissed off good.
[31:58.12]By the way, your friend is tied up with a knife on his neck in the next room.
[32:02.44]Make your choice, you know what I'm saying?
[32:15.07]I will never understand.
[32:16.86]Alright, call me a psycho, alright?
[32:18.46]Call me like you're bad at video games.
[32:19.72]I don't care.
[32:20.92]If you put, like, connect the fucking wire puzzles, like a hundred of them, in your, like, survival horror action game, you've made a mistake.
[32:29.54]You've made a mistake.
[32:30.78]A big one.
[32:32.24]A huge one.
[32:36.94]Put on some pounds.
[32:37.78]I did.
[32:38.04]I put 22 pounds on since, like, March.
[32:53.47]I met the Jigsaw killer and I let him escape.
[32:55.87]His price was too high and I was too weak.
[32:59.26]Jigsaw was holding Gordon's family hostage at gunpoint.
[33:03.50]Shots were fired and I ran over to respond.
[33:06.24]If I hadn't been in the next building, I don't know what would have happened.
[33:09.33]We would have had a shootout in Gordon's apartment.
[33:11.65]Then Jigsaw escaped and I gave chase.
[33:14.89]Jigsaw was a short man with brown hair, large blue eyes.
[33:18.95]I gave a render to the office that found me after I was released from the hellhole, Whitehurst.
[33:25.46]Jigsaw trapped me there.
[33:26.96]He did horrible things to me.
[33:29.64]In the end, he made me choose.
[33:31.90]Give up chasing him so that the others may live, or continue pursuit and watch them die.
[33:38.10]I gave up the chase, Mr. Freeman.
[33:40.96]I don't know if I made the right choice.
[33:49.72]Found a case file.
[33:50.50]Well, let me get in there.
[33:58.11]Escape Jigsaw's game.
[34:01.67]What is it?
[34:01.91]Gonna be like Picross this time?
[34:08.07]There are... This is a magic trick.
[34:13.30]This is magic.
[34:14.02]Those are both actors.
[34:15.56]There's gonna be like electricity.
[34:16.96]They're gonna scream.
[34:17.72]It's gonna open.
[34:18.18]They're gonna be gone.
[34:21.18]Right now they're just setting up a thing.
[34:22.38]Those guys are getting up.
[34:23.20]They're getting untied.
[34:34.04]I've seen this.
[34:34.84]I've seen this David Spade act before.
[34:36.82]Your persistence is not surprising, Campbell.
[34:49.36]I know that you have cancer.
[35:02.75]God, this game fucking sucks.
[35:07.01]Don't say that.
[35:07.73]Come on, don't say that.
[35:09.25]What choice is that?
[35:17.72]What do you mean?
[35:18.50]Okay, well, let's go.
[35:22.46]First major decision of the game.
[35:36.00]It's a stupid balance theme.
[35:40.70]Okay, above me.
[36:09.79]I can't... But that... I can't... I don't... I'm just gonna win.
[36:19.18]I'm playing the video game soft.
[36:21.22]Therefore, I'm never gonna sacrifice myself.
[36:23.24]Otherwise, I have to go back to the loading screen.
[36:25.32]Sorry, dude.
[36:25.90]I win.
[36:38.08]I'm always gonna pick me, guys.
[36:45.74]I don't think that would have played out a different way.
[36:47.48]I would have gone back to the checkpoint.
[36:53.51]You'd be surprised what tools can save a life.
[36:57.47]Sure.
[36:59.40]Thanks for the Warcraft 2004-esque tooltips.
[37:04.46]Right-clicking will open up your stacks in your inventory.
[37:08.54]They still have that shit down there.
[37:12.24]Blizzard, it's been like 15 fucking years.
[37:14.76]I think people know how to tab target by now.
[37:17.25]Take them off.
[37:20.05]Oh, I'm looking out a window.
[37:23.05]Stop with the WoW references.
[37:24.99]Look.
[37:26.33]It is first... What's going on here?
[37:31.95]You're never going to not get wild references.
[37:33.51]It took up like five years of my entire life.
[37:37.46]Alright, time to investigate.
[37:46.94]Tap, my boy.
[37:48.23]Good to see you.
[37:49.51]It's been a while, Chief Jacobs.
[37:51.59]Please, call me Henry.
[37:53.73]Yeah, don't mind us.
[37:54.57]We're just... This guy's not doing anything.
[37:57.87]But Corso's you a dead son.
[37:59.17]Without you, we'd all be behind bars.
[38:07.16]This guy's just shining a flashlight.
[38:08.38]Ooh, wait, the question.
[38:09.88]Oh, well.
[38:11.76]It must be the Riddler.
[38:13.84]Well, hold on a second, Batman.
[38:15.26]We're not sure about that yet.
[38:16.89]Textbook Riddler.
[38:20.05]Gordon.
[38:20.99]Commissioner Gordon.
[38:22.59]If I could ask you to leave the crime scene, I'll take it from here.
[38:26.55]Where's Two-Face?
[38:30.36]We have no idea where Two-Face is.
[38:32.26]Commissioner Gordon Freeman.
[38:35.00]Ha ha.
[38:37.06]After I got free of Jigsaw's nut house.
[38:41.64]It's been hard.
[38:43.44]You know how it is, right?
[38:45.90]The volume's too low?
[38:46.88]I got you.
[38:47.84]Solved.
[38:48.86]I'll find it.
[38:55.74]I remember the tap name holding some respect.
[38:58.24]A whole line of great cops.
[39:00.85]But now, all the good ones ended with your father.
[39:05.15]Get out of here, tap.
[39:08.39]Yeah, thanks.
[39:13.90]What is that?
[39:14.64]Who is doing that?
[39:16.68]Who is turning the TV on and off from like 1991?
[39:19.32]Oh, it's you.
[39:23.20]Quick user detective vision.
[39:30.17]I'm gonna fucking throw up if I stay like this.
[39:35.11]Ugh.
[39:38.70]See you later, Commissioner Gordon.
[39:40.49]See you later, Batman.
[39:41.67]And by Batman, by the way, take the binoculars down.
[39:45.39]There's no reason to hold them up constantly.
[39:47.01]It's gonna make you sick.
[39:49.01]Oh, right, right, sorry.
[39:49.91]Let me go back to regular FOV.
[39:51.35]Why am I silent?
[39:56.92]Yes, it's me.
[40:19.86]I would have loved it if it was just Batman.
[40:21.91]You know what I mean?
[40:22.65]If it was just Batman standing there.
[40:26.15]Silhouette from that far away.
[40:36.59]Tank top.
[40:37.33]I don't know.
[40:52.62]What's going on?
[40:54.58]What?
[40:55.03]How did you even get in here?
[40:56.81]You had to go out the same door.
[41:04.04]Okay, that had to have just been the girl or like my colleague.
[41:07.38]Somebody just followed me out and put like a mask on.
[41:23.13]I have to restart for what?
[41:26.48]Hello.
[41:27.68]Rise and shine.
[41:30.12]Rise and shine.
[41:32.64]Each of you have an opportunity to escape this room.
[41:38.00]The first one to move their cage to the door... Did we get this guy's story?
[41:43.55]However, there is no prize for second place.
[41:47.87]Oh, and watch your step.
[41:54.58]It'd be so much funnier if he says, like, dog poop or something.
[41:57.88]Okay.
[42:00.00]We just... The tortoise and the hare is... The hare goes really, really fast.
[42:16.79]So we're going to be the tortoise in this scenario.
[42:21.29]Why did he just say that?
[42:25.76]What was the point of saying the tortoise and the hare?
[42:31.20]I thought that was going to be way longer.
[42:32.38]Did I wait a little bit?
[42:38.62]All of a sudden you just hear like four or five seconds later.
[42:40.62]Bang!
[42:44.73]That's why I waited.
[42:45.49]Alright.
[42:45.73]Okay.
[42:55.25]I made it.
[42:57.56]No, okay, which we get that guy that guy still alive There's no prize for second place Aka
[43:28.05]Scenario we found in the quality assurance testing to be impossible to fail.
[43:37.11]You will need to investigate your surroundings like the reporter you claim to be.
[43:43.21]Save their lives and find the story of your father's death.
[43:47.38]Discovering the truth will set you free.
[43:51.36]Fuck you, you fucking psycho!
[43:54.10]You killed my dad.
[43:55.58]I'll find
[43:57.40]You know what I would do in this situation?
[43:58.80]I'm dead serious.
[44:00.47]How the hell do I get out of here?
[44:01.41]I would probably just look at the camera and just be like, hey, yo, dude.
[44:06.13]I'm fucking into this.
[44:07.79]Let me help you.
[44:08.73]Let me help you.
[44:09.21]Let me be like your right hand man.
[44:12.36]Let's get back at these people.
[44:13.92]Let's get back at all these fucking people.
[44:15.94]I'm with you.
[44:17.04]I want to be on your team, Jigsaw.
[44:19.90]And then he's going to go... You two actually could use a pair of hands.
[44:23.52]Somebody to unload and load up at the dock when we get all the metal and...
[44:29.40]I'm your guy, just let me in.
[44:38.74]And I go through the door.
[44:40.41]And then when I get there, I'm like, hey, what's going on?
[44:42.27]I'm ready to help you.
[44:43.13]And then my hands go around his neck.
[44:44.91]And I squeeze the life out of him until he fucking turns purple.
[44:48.37]And then I leave.
[44:57.78]You need someone to chew up the glass.
[45:05.22]Hey, by the way, some of you guys might not know this, glass don't come broken.
[45:10.56]This has to be broken for this little bit here.
[45:20.75]Where's that guy?
[45:21.39]Okay, how do I leave?
[45:23.31]Didn't he give me a second chance?
[45:24.43]Wasn't he supposed to open the door?
[45:27.52]Oh.
[45:29.24]Okay.
[45:36.46]Ah, yes.
[45:36.76]Broken glass from glass being broken.
[45:38.54]No, you don't order broken glass.
[45:43.08]You don't go to a glass blowing whatever company and say, hey, I'd like 5,000 pounds of broken glass.
[45:52.71]You order panes of glass and then somebody has to smash them on the ground.
[45:56.86]Oh, what's this?
[45:58.52]A, B... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A. It's okay.
[46:01.44]It's the letter.
[46:01.84]It's the alphabet.
[46:04.15]15.
[46:04.41]Okay.
[46:04.69]So, M is 1.
[46:05.89]Somebody screenshot it.
[46:07.37]I don't care.
[46:07.81]Prove you deserve a second chance.
[46:11.63]S-O-N.
[46:13.65]Okay.
[46:14.07]What's S-O?
[46:14.81]S-O-N.
[46:16.86]The password is S-O-N.
[46:18.82]S-O-N.
[46:19.38]Alright.
[46:21.92]So, if the password is S-O-N, then we have to assume...
[46:28.75]A, B, C. So there's no S here.
[46:31.45]Is there O?
[46:31.81]What do you mean count?
[46:42.34]Alright, M is... L is 26.
[46:45.52]L, M. N, O, P. M, N. M, N. M is 2.
[46:52.71]L, M, 2.
[46:54.87]L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S would be 7.
[46:59.40]So it's 7, 2, 7, 2, uh, wait, what's it doing?
[47:06.44]Oh.
[47:10.89]Oh, it's 3.
[47:14.21]And it's 2, right?
[47:16.73]So it's 7, 3, 2.
[47:35.74]I deserve a second chance.
[47:40.93]Of course.
[47:50.31]It's just not even... Why even have the door?
[47:59.48]Ruby, you deserve a second chance.
[48:00.64]I did prove it.
[48:01.42]Now give me a needle.
[48:07.38]I fooled you, tricked you.
[48:08.34]Wait!
[48:10.71]Not this time.
[48:11.29]That almost shot him in the head.
[48:14.09]Do I still have a flashlight or did they take that from me?
[48:20.81]I think they took it from me.
[48:31.43]Why would you duck?
[48:32.13]I don't know.
[48:37.01]Weapon.
[48:38.85]Nice.
[48:39.11]Alright, how do I attack with weapon?
[48:46.33]It's not what I wanted to do, I just wasted a health pack.
[48:51.01]How do you swing?
[48:54.42]It's not R1, not R2, not L2.
[48:56.08]Triangle, circle.
[48:58.64]How do you fight?
[49:02.42]Square, it's not square.
[49:06.45]He's talking.
[49:10.38]Oh, you are.
[49:10.98]You and me.
[49:11.66]Let's go.
[49:12.38]How do you attack?
[49:15.04]Oh!
[49:38.77]Is this turn-based combat?
[49:48.92]No, it's not.
[49:51.30]What's a swing?
[49:54.06]It's turn-based combat.
[49:58.52]No, it can't be.
[49:59.57]It actually can't be.
[50:04.15]It's QTE-based combat.
[50:07.66]The first game was you could swing the bat and swing the melee and have a gun and... Take his life to earn back yours.
[50:29.52]Why would you make it a QTE game?
[50:34.02]We're supposed to revolutionize and evolutionize our sequels.
[50:43.66]Why take combat out of the game?
[50:53.82]had to have been people that worked on this when the the lead guy was like okay so here we are we're gonna take combat out of the game oh I don't that's probably really bad we're gonna replace it with qtes oh oh this is bad this is really bad alright well I need to sir we have to find a fuse search the random boxes
[51:22.95]I can't even see where a box even is.
[51:26.55]Veto?
[51:27.13]No, I can't veto this.
[51:28.31]I have to at least suffer through this for a couple of hours.
[51:30.30]I have to.
[51:33.20]I beat Saw 1.
[51:35.10]I can't let Saw 2 beat me that easily.
[51:39.08]What did I miss?
[51:42.04]Are we going to give up that easily?
[51:43.14]You guys are going to give up that easily?
[51:47.71]Check the body.
[51:50.37]Oh, god damn it.
[51:59.10]Yeah, we were fighting for his fuse that he had in his pocket.
[52:03.51]His vial.
[52:04.17]Put it on.
[52:13.36]No, I'm not vetoing.
[52:14.88]I'm going to suffer through this for at least another 30 minutes.
[52:17.21]At least.
[52:22.34]I pressed it, right?
[52:22.92]I did.
[52:25.60]He's going to torture us.
[52:27.78]No.
[52:28.58]Okay.
[52:29.54]This is really important for you guys to understand.
[52:31.02]I am not torturing you.
[52:32.88]I am torturing me.
[52:35.71]And you are watching me get tortured.
[52:39.39]I'm not torturing you.
[52:41.35]I'm the one getting electrocuted.
[52:43.55]You're watching me get electrocuted.
[52:52.31]Okay, follow the rules.
[52:55.01]Am I gonna get a minus one attack on my next buff?
[52:59.29]What is it?
[52:59.55]What's the card?
[53:00.31]I fucked it up.
[53:00.75]Who cares?
[53:01.39]What's the guy say?
[53:03.10]Follow the rules.
[53:04.42]Everyone gets minus one attack?
[53:05.76]30 seconds.
[53:16.67]Oh, I have to stop it at one of these?
[53:19.77]At four?
[53:20.39]How the fuck am I gonna stop the fourth digit at four?
[53:25.39]What?
[53:34.64]Sorry, dude, you're dead.
[53:35.64]They all have to be zero?
[53:37.10]They're all gonna be zero.
[53:39.75]Hey, it's really hard.
[53:41.11]I'm sorry.
[53:52.11]If it were you over here, you would have the same problem.
[53:55.13]I feel really bad, man, but you can't be mad at me for not doing a puzzle.
[54:01.37]You would have had to do the same shit.
[54:02.33]You would have had to do the same thing.
[54:03.29]Wait, what's that say?
[54:11.24]Ooh.
[54:12.12]Peak. 3054.
[54:20.28]That's so stupid.
[54:22.06]It's so dumb.
[54:23.08]Just, I fucked it up, but whatever.
[54:25.57]3054.
[54:28.51]This is escape room.
[54:32.23]You know when you can play those escape rooms?
[54:33.81]This is what they do.
[54:37.01]This is escape room that you all pay $75 each to do.
[54:42.28]They set this stuff up for you so you can make sure you can leave.
[54:48.93]This game was probably 60 bucks when it came out.
[54:54.47]Oh shit, that guy.
[54:58.31]Oh, that person tried to go in there and he died.
[55:02.33]What can I do?
[55:04.33]Oh.
[55:12.99]Chase sequence coming up?
[55:13.87]I think it's going to be a chase sequence.
[55:15.08]I can't wait.
[55:18.02]I can't wait to press X at the right time to swing my weapon at a guy.
[55:21.47]Alright, what is this?
[55:28.83]Combination lock?
[55:29.45]I don't know.
[55:31.52]Gotta go find the glow-in-the-dark shit.
[55:36.62]What is this?
[55:39.02]Griff.
[55:45.72]Obsessed with a female professor who wanted nothing to do with you.
[55:51.12]Next message.
[55:52.79]Hey, why'd you do that?
[55:53.91]Listen.
[55:55.47]Rape is a serious crime, Griff.
[55:58.63]It labels you as a sex offender.
[56:01.45]A ticking time bomb that nobody wants to be around.
[56:07.26]Kind of like the bomb you are attached to right now.
[56:11.28]Oh, that guy was sitting there.
[56:12.76]Where is he?
[56:15.17]Okay, well he exploded.
[56:17.37]There he is.
[56:18.08]A little of him is over there.
[56:20.86]Some of them is over there.
[56:22.52]Some of them is on the wall back there.
[56:42.62]Alright.
[56:43.78]Is there another answering machine?
[56:46.24]No.
[56:47.80]Wait.
[56:50.34]This would be a second message on the machine.
[56:53.41]He has a script.
[56:55.19]He didn't go back and delete these ones.
[56:58.53]He tried to do the thing where he calls somebody and leaves a voicemail and deletes like eight of them before he gets the perfect one.
[57:03.31]I'm just waiting for one of these to be like... I'm waiting for one of these to be like...
[57:12.90]Your lip is... Fuck!
[57:20.34]Next message.
[57:20.98]Hello again, Griff.
[57:23.40]It's me, Jigsaw.
[57:26.47]And I... Fucking tried again.
[57:30.79]Next message.
[57:32.45]Griff.
[57:33.85]You shitty person.
[57:37.96]Next message.
[57:39.96]Hello again, Griff.
[57:41.70]Next message.
[58:18.46]There's a gun behind here.
[58:19.54]Use it to shoot the guy in the next room.
[58:22.72]Okay.
[58:23.38]Call me later.
[58:24.46]Bye.
[58:27.75]Okay, that's it.
[58:28.81]Here comes a Family Guy joke.
[58:31.11]Oh!
[58:31.25]Yeah!
[58:45.34]Whoa!
[58:45.98]Defend!
[58:47.42]Oh, good!
[58:47.82]I just hit the ball 300 yards in the golf game I'm fucking playing.
[58:50.96]What?
[59:05.97]This is so much worse than the first game.
[59:07.39]It's not even funny.
[59:09.35]This is not... It's so much worse than the first one.
[59:12.35]But we're suffering.
[59:13.27]It's Halloween.
[59:17.97]And what do you do on Halloween?
[59:19.67]Well, you don't suffer.
[59:21.95]Other people suffer, though.
[59:23.99]You know, like you watch... Exorcist, and everyone's suffering in that movie.
[59:32.71]That's kind of what this is.
[59:33.68]That's what you're doing.
[59:34.24]Did it fall twice?
[59:37.32]I suffer.
[59:41.46]I suffer.
[59:44.96]Yeah, just imagine my head just went around in a circle and vomit came out of my mouth.
[59:47.93]Alright, I need a key to go over that.
[59:56.51]Wait, wait.
[59:59.39]Aww.
[60:00.11]Wait, hold on.
[60:00.63]There it is right there.
[60:01.54]8-1-2-0.
[60:01.62]Just have the doors open.
[60:09.22]Just have them open.
[60:17.04]It's so meaningless.
[60:18.18]Just have the doors open.
[60:23.80]It's just extra time in between opening each door.
[60:31.68]Ready to go down here?
[60:40.05]Can't open this.
[60:45.44]Filler?
[60:46.96]Okay, hold on.
[60:48.38]Let's see.
[60:48.70]Third time's a charm.
[60:49.33]Strike three.
[60:57.03]Who is waiting with a shotgun?
[61:02.32]Okay, that's pretty good.
[61:04.12]That was pretty good.
[61:17.42]They added that just to do that.
[61:18.92]You know what?
[61:19.44]I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that that's what they did that for.
[61:28.11]Oh my god, this is so far back.
[61:29.57]Don't fuck that up again.
[61:30.65]Oh, wait, I have another chance to save this guy.
[61:35.27]Can I go in the room he's in?
[61:39.61]Can I go in?
[61:42.13]Oh, come on.
[61:42.63]I wish I could just go in the room.
[61:50.45]I can't just go in.
[61:51.01]I'm trying.
[62:04.99]Shit, dude.
[62:05.51]This is fucking hard.
[62:07.39]Oh, man.
[62:07.85]Sorry.
[62:08.03]It's fucking hard over here.
[62:09.05]Here we go.
[62:16.50]Four, five.
[62:17.12]It's hard.
[62:23.64]How did I get that wrong?
[62:27.09]3054.
[62:27.25]Oops.
[62:32.55]No messing around.
[62:33.13]I actually want to get through this.
[62:39.85]Cool.
[62:40.23]Yep.
[62:40.55]We went over here.
[62:41.29]We said what the hell happened to that guy.
[62:42.55]We snuck in here.
[62:44.36]Got the thing here.
[62:47.02]What was the T-pose?
[62:47.84]Yeah.
[62:48.26]That was weird.
[62:53.04]You just let a guy explode and laughed.
[62:56.50]Well, that's because that was the second time we'd seen it.
[62:58.26]Alright, don't know that one.
[63:01.78]Alright, we go to this way.
[63:10.54]Here he comes.
[63:14.32]Holy fuck, are you kidding me?
[63:25.05]Why did wood come out of his head?
[63:28.01]Why is this guy made out of wood?
[63:35.55]Alright, we're back where we were.
[63:36.57]Everyone relax.
[63:37.41]Everybody chill out.
[63:38.13]I'm not going to get caught by this again.
[63:41.61]Oh.
[63:41.67]Yeah, okay.
[63:52.52]I need the key.
[63:54.98]Play Exanima, or this is pre-recorded.
[63:56.74]Exanima, this, I'm playing a scary horror video game right now.
[64:00.32]Alright, let's not fuck this up.
[64:01.12]Here we go.
[64:08.36]He doesn't do it twice.
[64:09.26]He does do it twice.
[64:09.98]Why is the gun still there?
[64:15.96]Oh, I thought it was somebody holding the gun at the door.
[64:18.56]5-4-3-0.
[64:28.92]I thought it was like every Tarantino movie.
[64:31.34]Where there's just like... Like, what's that?
[64:34.37]Somebody at the door.
[64:40.39]I don't want to even play this one.
[64:41.33]I don't even have enough things to do it.
[64:44.95]I can do it.
[64:45.45]No, I can't.
[64:53.56]I don't have enough.
[64:55.88]I don't even have remotely enough to do this.
[65:02.85]Alright, bye.
[65:03.55]Wait!
[65:06.91]I didn't think I could pick that one up.
[65:08.55]Alright, we're going big one first.
[65:17.40]Come on.
[65:18.10]Come on.
[65:18.58]What?
[65:21.20]What?
[65:25.64]What?
[65:30.66]Stop going out of the game.
[65:39.62]I don't think I have enough.
[65:44.18]What he said?
[65:44.96]Coggers?
[65:49.05]I can't do it.
[65:49.53]I don't have enough.
[65:55.01]Wait.
[65:55.41]I can do it.
[65:55.83]Is this because Chuck E. Cheese said poggers that time when he went like poggers?
[66:02.77]No.
[66:03.25]Poggers.
[66:04.39]I got it.
[66:07.08]No.
[66:16.39]Oh, I got a key.
[66:24.98]Ooh.
[66:25.36]Gotta pretend to be engaged.
[66:29.26]Gotta pretend to be engaged in the game.
[66:30.62]Say things like ooh and huh and ugh.
[66:33.65]Gotta pretend to be engaged.
[66:39.11]Can't have dead hair.
[66:39.85]Can't have more than five seconds to go by without a noise coming out of my mouth.
[66:43.79]People will leave.
[66:44.59]They'll leave and they'll find somebody that's funnier and has more voices come out of them.
[66:49.15]Gotta fucking talk.
[66:52.34]Okay.
[66:52.62]Where's that locked door, guys?
[66:55.12]Over here, I think it was.
[66:56.30]Yeah, it is.
[66:56.82]Let me unlock it real quick.
[66:59.06]Keep talking.
[66:59.84]Keep them here.
[67:01.32]Balancing board.
[67:02.12]Look out.
[67:02.72]Whoa, it's tricky.
[67:04.12]Okay.
[67:08.17]Oh, chat, we almost lost it.
[67:10.97]Stop?
[67:11.41]Knock it off.
[67:11.93]What?
[67:21.82]You know, that back wall back there, I feel like I've done Christmas decorations like that before.
[67:28.58]Just because, like, fuck it, get him up.
[67:29.87]I don't care.
[67:32.07]Just put him up.
[67:35.35]It doesn't matter.
[67:36.07]Who's going to be mad about it?
[67:42.55]The case file.
[67:44.17]Shit, I'm doing that thing again.
[67:48.79]Quick, jingle your keys for us.
[67:57.21]2020 decoration stats.
[67:58.91]Strats.
[67:59.31]No, that's all decoration.
[68:00.89]Don't you know you just decorate the front part of the tree?
[68:05.81]Wherever your tree is, if it's in a corner, just decorate the part that is visible, the 180 degrees that's visible.
[68:12.00]Don't do the back.
[68:13.02]It's just extra time.
[68:16.64]Because getting them off is a huge pain in the ass.
[68:21.06]It's razor wire.
[68:22.00]Well, this is not, I don't, that's not my Christmas decorations.
[68:26.52]Wait, I, what do I do?
[68:28.44]Need a nail?
[68:35.66]Oh, good thing I looked in the one dumb place that it was.
[68:40.80]It's not a pain in the ass.
[68:41.68]It's tradition.
[68:44.52]Well, no, it's tradition for the first, like, ten years until everybody kind of doesn't care anymore.
[68:58.79]Once you get over the age of like 15, 16, 17, 18, it's more... Alright, let's decorate the tree.
[69:07.33]Oh, okay.
[69:08.33]Yeah, that sounds cool.
[69:11.72]Oh, can we just do the plastic candy canes this year?
[69:14.44]That's enough, right?
[69:19.34]And by the way, plastic candy canes that you easily hang.
[69:24.36]And lights.
[69:26.05]Wrap it around or just put it all over him.
[69:28.39]That's enough.
[69:33.29]Look, if you decorate your tree like crazy, you know what?
[69:35.77]I'm glad you and your family have that awesome time.
[69:37.73]Whoever.
[69:38.41]You and your significant other.
[69:39.50]Whoever.
[69:40.04]Just you.
[69:40.62]You might just do it for fun.
[69:41.28]I'm glad you enjoy it.
[69:44.64]Give me the plastic candy canes and just some red lights and I'm done.
[69:52.28]Fuck this guy.
[69:53.14]No, I didn't say that it was stupid.
[69:54.54]Did I say it was stupid?
[69:56.68]I may have.
[69:57.02]No, I didn't.
[69:58.76]No, I didn't.
[69:59.28]I never said it was stupid.
[70:04.02]Look in the nightstand.
[70:08.97]Oh, the window?
[70:09.45]No, over here.
[70:14.85]He's a Grinch.
[70:20.77]No, I... Sorry, no, I've never broken into a bunch of people's houses and stolen items from their house.
[70:27.15]I'm not the Grinch.
[70:29.69]You can call me, uh, what's the bah humbug guy?
[70:33.47]Okay, the ballroom.
[70:39.08]Scrooge, right.
[70:40.22]Call me Scrooge, not the Grinch.
[70:41.32]Okay.
[70:51.35]Scrooge is worse.
[70:54.55]Is Scrooge worse than the Grinch?
[70:57.55]Let's break this down.
[71:00.53]Scrooge... Ebenezer Scrooge.
[71:04.45]He was like a billionaire or something.
[71:06.13]And he like owned all of New York or something, right?
[71:11.47]He was a dick.
[71:12.79]What did he do?
[71:14.84]Well, I don't remember the story.
[71:15.72]I remember he was just kind of like an old guy that everybody like thought was...
[71:19.06]Ebenezer Scrooge.
[71:20.06]What secrets are you ashamed to reveal?
[71:22.31]He killed people.
[71:23.29]He killed... He literally killed children.
[71:26.25]He starved children and killed them.
[71:29.39]Um... Okay.
[71:32.35]Uh... Well... Uh... Maybe stealing an iPad out of somebody's house is... Not as bad.
[71:40.78]Let me retract that statement.
[71:42.08]The Grinch is not worse than Scrooge.
[71:45.52]Wait, didn't the Grinch, like, kill people too in the original story?
[71:49.11]Well, in the original story, didn't the Grinch... Didn't the Grinch, like, kill somebody?
[71:54.47]No?
[71:55.15]Sort of?
[71:55.79]He did something crazy.
[71:56.63]He did something bad.
[72:02.24]The Grinch ate people.
[72:03.60]He ate people.
[72:04.90]Wait a minute.
[72:05.38]Hold on.
[72:05.80]Back up here.
[72:06.36]The Grinch ate children.
[72:11.12]No, he didn't.
[72:16.30]Why would Dr. Seuss do that?
[72:20.82]Guys, both of these stories I have not seen or read or heard in more than a few decades.
[72:27.32]Yes, there was the Ron Howard Grinch movie, but I only watched that movie for the Jim Carrey noises.
[72:32.25]I didn't pay attention to the story at all.
[72:34.59]15 years ago when it came out.
[72:37.45]And the original cartoon I watched 20 years ago?
[72:47.20]Jim Carrey, fanboy.
[72:48.62]Okay, so that's a bad thing?
[72:54.83]Oh, thank God they're not all like that.
[73:01.80]100%, he sucks.
[73:05.12]Alright, hold on a minute.
[73:06.10]You need to go watch The Mask.
[73:08.56]Just do it tonight.
[73:11.08]It's like a Christmas movie.
[73:12.01]Wait, it's a Halloween.
[73:12.75]It's a Halloween movie.
[73:13.99]He's in a costume and he goes to costume parties and stuff.
[73:16.37]Watch The Mask tonight.
[73:18.09]Do it.
[73:18.95]And then I want you to come back tomorrow and then tell me that Jim Carrey's not good.
[73:26.16]You have to do that.
[73:30.03]Why the TV's on the ground?
[73:31.21]He's getting kind of... He's getting a little rave party here.
[73:36.19]Wait.
[73:36.97]Floor puzzle.
[73:44.30]Um, okay.
[73:46.56]Camera.
[73:49.02]That hurt.
[73:51.12]No, I don't want to do it.
[73:52.18]I don't want to do it.
[73:54.26]But I have to.
[73:55.08]Ah.
[73:55.14]Ah.
[73:59.69]Looks like what we have here is a person.
[74:03.03]Camera.
[74:04.13]I had to do it.
[74:05.29]I'm sorry, I had to.
[74:11.54]Okay, step on the hearts.
[74:17.20]Step on the tape.
[74:21.66]And then step on the camera.
[74:22.88]And then step on the heart.
[74:29.04]And step on the puzzle piece.
[74:30.62]It's not gonna be that easy.
[74:32.40]It is gonna be that easy.
[74:35.82]No, it's not.
[74:36.68]Go down.
[74:37.08]Camera.
[74:46.25]Uh... Okay.
[74:48.34]I don't get this one.
[74:54.88]Just jump over it.
[74:57.60]Yeah, just take a running start and jump over it and roll on your back.
[75:03.44]The first time you get electrocuted, don't you think you're just going to throw your body over this?
[75:07.90]That's not that far.
[75:09.62]That's not that far.
[75:10.75]Some people can step over this if they really wanted to.
[75:14.53]You can jump over that.
[75:18.59]Veto this at 3.05 PM.
[75:20.49]No!
[75:22.21]You are stuck here.
[75:26.29]Alright, but is there like a thing to look at here?
[75:28.44]Why?

[76:19.94]Puzzle.
[76:24.26]Um...
[76:27.03]He's doing the same thing.
[76:28.79]Well, what the fuck is this puzzle?
[76:44.18]You have to start from the same place.
[76:47.84]The answer was outside of the door you walked into.
[77:00.89]No, it's not.
[77:03.45]Stop pretending you're going to lose viewers.
[77:05.01]That's how you gain viewers.
[77:06.19]So, don't tell me not to do that.
[77:13.84]TV at the beginning.
[77:16.54]It's on that TV?
[77:20.24]Is it?
[77:20.66]Wait, hold on.
[77:25.90]Oh my fucking god.

[77:36.96]Okay, cool.
[77:37.92]Oh, I'm gonna get hurt.
[77:53.45]Wait, what?
[77:55.49]Art and tape.
[77:58.31]Can I go diagonal?
[78:04.51]You can't go diagonal.
[78:06.68]I'm going to get in trouble for cheating.
[78:14.26]You just did?
[78:14.92]I wasn't watching.
[78:16.56]I was watching the stream.
[78:25.11]I know for a fact that almost everyone here does not care about that.
[78:28.91]That means you care about this game.
[78:32.21]There's no way.
[78:36.72]Keeping track of this case using this journal will help organize my thoughts.
[78:41.37]Keep shocked.
[78:42.29]Wait, are these... Please tell me this is Saw.
[78:45.75]No, come on.
[78:46.93]I can't just play his audio tapes.
[78:48.61]I can't play his, like, auditions.
[79:04.14]No, feels bad, man.
[79:08.67]Okay, that's cool.
[79:09.49]I got a lockpick now.
[79:13.73]It also doesn't help that this game is ugly and dark.
[79:22.00]It's too bright and too dark at the same time.
[79:30.88]It's like it's only bloom effects are the lighting and then it's just pitch black.
[79:42.29]How do I go to the next one?
[79:46.85]Oh my god.
[79:55.22]I have a weapon.
[79:58.04]I need a combo now.
[80:00.40]Let's get the combination.
[80:01.52]Where's the combination?
[80:02.48]Is it in the ashtray?

[82:15.15]He was like, oh, ah, hot.
[82:19.39]Oh, okay.
[82:19.85]That's really, really funny.

[83:15.75]When you take a plate out of the microwave too early.
[83:25.41]Where am I going?
[83:25.95]Uh, I don't know.

[85:12.21]I didn't have to do it in order last time, did I?
[85:24.69]That was a misclick.
[85:25.45]I didn't mean to do that.
[85:31.99]Nail, heartbeat.
[85:33.61]What?
[85:39.18]Uh, nail, heartbeat over there.

[85:57.85]Anything else?
[86:02.55]Leaked?
[86:07.07]I just received a call asking for my comment on the jigsaw killings.
[86:11.83]How did they know?
[86:13.47]Somebody else will read those.
[86:18.75]Feeling alright?
[86:19.67]Can we veto the game for you?
[86:21.33]No, don't veto the game.
[86:23.11]I'm playing the game right now.
[86:24.31]You don't have to veto the game for me.
[86:25.33]Okay, find something to cut the chain.
[86:31.16]So I need bolts or something.
[86:34.60]There's no chance in hell I'm vetoing this game.
[86:37.50]No, not yet.
[86:44.25]Please.
[86:48.37]God, if only I could get in the time machine.
[86:51.25]The amount of people that begged me to play this game every day for like three months and now everybody wants me to delete it?
[87:04.40]Nope.
[87:12.94]Sick.
[87:16.63]Here we go.
[87:16.99]I got the thing to cut the chain with.
[87:25.11]We have to beat at least the first boss before I freak out.
[87:36.87]Literally 5,000 new viewers did not hear you make that promise.
[87:39.96]Oh, that's true.
[87:40.48]You're right.
[87:40.96]This is 10k people here.
[87:43.64]So those of you that weren't here, I promised I was going to play Saw 2 three months ago for Halloween.
[87:49.48]Everyone was like, oh my god, I can't fucking wait, dude.
[87:52.72]It's going to be the most fun thing ever.
[87:58.42]I have no idea what just happened.
[88:06.71]Uh, okay.
[88:07.75]We made a hole in the ground?
[88:08.91]I don't want to fall because I'd have to go down there, but I'll die if I fall from this high.
[88:18.87]Apparently, the humans in this game weigh 1,500 pounds.
[88:22.63]Some people do, don't they?
[88:26.40]I was the fattest person ever on record.
[88:32.76]I can't just jump from here.
[88:37.68]I kind of want to just fall down, but no.
[88:44.93]Wait, we'll have to... 900 pounds is the fattest person on record?
[88:51.43]Your mom.
[88:53.93]Nice.
[88:58.91]Please click the link.
[88:59.81]No.
[89:00.17]Okay, I will.
[89:03.19]What does it say?
[89:04.81]Good link?
[89:10.46]Okay, this is... You know I love when people say this shit because I know for a fact that you do not think that this is real.
[89:20.85]Well, that too.
[89:21.83]There's no way that anybody thinks that was real.
[89:23.09]If you thought that was real, you'd be... There'd be something wrong.
[89:25.13]There's no way that anybody thinks this is real.
[89:34.92]It's just not like it.
[89:36.32]No, this is absolutely not.
[89:38.40]I'm having a bunch of fun.
[89:40.12]I'm having a ton of fun It doesn't get to be the worst stream of 2020 unless I don't have a good time That's true
[90:02.57]You can't stop complaining.
[90:05.00]But sometimes it's fun to complain, don't you think?
[90:21.61]Oh, shit.
[90:22.91]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[90:23.73]The game's saved.
[90:24.17]Okay, thank God.
[90:24.69]It's one of these.
[90:25.49]It's the same thing.
[90:26.41]It's a traffic jam puzzle.
[90:30.57]I need to get the whole thing.
[90:31.73]We gotta go through.
[90:32.61]I feel like I'm just playing the other game.

[91:43.27]That wasn't in the last game.
[91:47.23]You just had to unblock the door in the last game.

[92:03.92]Push the cart, little man.
[92:06.56]Where's Saw?
[92:07.30]I feel like I haven't heard his voice.
[92:08.64]It's making me mad.
[92:26.83]I cannot believe that you have to do this.
[92:32.91]I can't believe it.
[92:43.00]Do I get a gun eventually?
[92:44.64]I think I do.
[92:45.08]Play God Hand now.

[99:48.07]I saw it.
[99:48.65]I saw it.
[99:49.07]I saw it.
[99:49.37]I saw it.
[99:49.73]I saw it.
[99:50.03]How the fuck did you guys even see that when I was walking around being a dickhead?
[99:52.63]Alright, so we talked to this guy?
[99:54.78]Oh my god.
[99:58.80]Don't feel too bad for Zeke.
[100:02.10]Those hands used to touch little girls.
[100:05.63]Now they'll just touch the bottom of a trash bin.
[100:14.28]Okay, so... In the first game, you know... You ate far too many sweets last night.
[100:25.23]We're just killing criminals.
[100:40.12]You've been putting forth a facade for far too long, Jeremy.
[100:44.51]For years, you've been pretending that Santa comes down.
[100:49.45]Through the chimney, you're a liar.
[100:52.39]You put out cookies and carrots and pretend that the reindeer are eating them.
[100:59.03]Far too long have you lied.
[101:00.17]Now it's time to pay the price.
[101:03.75]Before you was a snowman.
[101:06.19]And a carrot.
[101:08.05]Make your choice.
[101:09.57]Will you put the carrot on his dick and have him pretty funny?
[101:13.79]Or...
[101:15.26]You disarm the bomb and put it on his nose where it belongs.
[101:19.68]Make your choice.
[101:24.94]Sicko, you're crazy!
[101:31.37]But, I mean, I am going to put it on his dick.
[101:33.91]So you might as well blow the rope up.
[101:36.17]Come on!
[101:36.57]Okay, so now what do we do?
[101:49.87]Unlock this door!
[101:52.47]Why does everything have to be seaweed?
[101:57.78]Turn to the lobby.
[102:03.10]Guys, I have no idea where the lobby is from here.
[102:09.35]Oh.
[102:19.06]You promised us Exanima.
[102:21.32]I never promised Exanima.
[102:23.10]I said I'm going to look into it.
[102:24.30]Got that.
[102:32.89]Is this not the lobby?
[102:35.03]If I have to keep going back, it's not this door?
[102:40.41]Oh, shit.
[102:40.69]Let me go in here.
[102:55.16]How does this guy get out of the mall?
[102:58.53]Me?
[102:58.81]It is kind of tricky, I'll be honest with you.
[103:05.05]And I'm not making this up.
[103:08.51]Did I park here?
[103:10.09]When did we come in?
[103:11.07]I took the right and went down towards where the food is.
[103:15.37]I feel like everybody's like that.
[103:22.28]I will tell you at complete total confidence that the last ten times I've been to a mall, maybe eight or nine times I walked around going with my horn because I had no idea where the car was.
[103:38.07]Probably eight or nine times out of ten.
[103:43.41]No.
[103:43.97]I feel like way more people that will admit that actually do that.
[103:48.85]You guys don't do that.
[103:56.47]Just get a valet.
[103:57.35]At the mall?
[104:02.73]What mall do you go to that has a valet?
[104:06.07]A mall valet.
[104:22.76]At Walmart.
[104:23.44]Imagine there was a valet at Walmart.
[104:25.00]That would be so ridiculous.
[104:32.56]I, you know.
[104:33.18]Holy shit.
[104:36.80]Imagine like a. Imagine an app.
[104:40.62]Where you.
[104:41.72]You can just drive to like and be.
[104:45.03]You can be a valet somewhere.
[104:48.49]Like.
[104:50.83]That would be so ridiculous.
[104:53.03]You could have like be a valet at Walmart.
[104:56.03]I need someone to.
[104:56.67]That's just Uber.
[104:59.16]That's Uber with an extra step.
[105:03.95]Like, oh, come get me and my groceries and just drive me home.
[105:09.20]Come get me and drive me to my car?
[105:11.30]That's like next level laziness.
[105:18.12]An uber valet.
[105:25.41]I can't even.
[105:25.97]Alright, you guys have... Okay, alright, alright.
[105:28.47]I gotta play.
[105:30.31]I gotta play.
[105:44.10]Alright, so nothing up here.
[105:47.52]Alright, ban the word Exanima from like Nightbot.
[105:51.46]Have Nightbot start banning the word Exanima.
[106:00.05]I'll do it.
[106:00.45]That should be done.
[106:19.14]Toilet.
[106:20.82]What's that?
[106:24.36]Reach into the toilet and grab the, uh, key or something, right?
[106:27.69]Like the la- yep.
[106:35.78]For a second I thought that was all in my head.
[106:38.64]You went bobbing, you stuffed your head in there.
[106:40.78]Probably not smart.
[106:46.19]It's the same animation.
[106:47.11]Well, it's probably the exact same copy and pasted video game with new rooms being made.
[106:52.67]What's that case file?
[106:57.33]Okay.
[107:11.58]Exanima.
[107:12.50]Banned.
[107:15.33]Hold on.
[107:16.27]Otto wants to go outside.
[107:33.25]Okay.
[107:34.79]Oh my goodness.
[107:35.47]That just exploded.
[107:39.41]Show Otto.
[107:40.32]Hold on.
[107:40.64]I have to itch my eye.
[107:49.66]I did this.
[107:52.30]What's currently the thing?
[107:53.20]Wait.
[107:56.13]Why is this door not open?
[107:58.47]There is someone waiting to be freed in the lobby.
[108:01.45]In here?
[108:10.08]Alright, let's get him.
[108:22.76]What are we going to do?
[108:25.42]Hello, Henry.
[108:26.32]When you were promoted to chief of police, you vowed to rid the streets of drug abuse.
[108:32.86]Somebody just wrote, I know that guy.
[108:35.60]You have become part of the problem instead of the solution.
[108:41.73]You have defiled the oath you made to protect the public.
[108:48.21]Now, usually when an officer of the law falls as low as
[108:55.15]What do I have to do?
[109:01.35]I told you this is where you eat somebody.
[109:03.19]Well, he's definitely gonna die.
[109:27.66]This is your chance to see the light by turning them off.
[109:33.52]You have to play Candy Crush.
[109:35.04]The only way you'll save his life is if you get a five match super bomb explosion in Candy Crush on level 480.
[109:46.45]And that's really hard to do without boosters.
[109:52.05]I know this because I had to spend
[109:55.62]Turn all the lights off.
[110:06.79]Sure, how about this one?
[110:10.95]How about that one?
[110:12.45]How about this one?
[110:13.16]And then how about that one?
[110:14.66]And then how about this one?
[110:15.78]And then how about that one?
[110:16.92]And then how about this one?
[110:17.98]And then how about that one?
[110:18.70]And then this one?
[110:20.40]Saved you!
[110:23.61]How about this one?
[110:24.09]And then we'll do that one.
[110:25.43]And then how about this one?
[110:26.55]And then that one.
[110:27.07]And then how about this one?
[110:28.91]Saved you.
[110:32.26]Let's go with this one.
[110:33.28]How about that one?
[110:34.34]And we'll do this one.
[110:35.38]And then we'll go this one.
[110:36.60]And then this one.
[110:37.34]And then that one.
[110:38.36]And then we'll do this one.
[110:39.04]And then we'll give you that one.
[110:40.38]And we'll get you with this one.
[110:41.70]And then this one.
[110:42.18]And then we'll shot this one off.
[110:48.24]No, and then we'll shut this one off.
[110:49.73]Shut that one off.
[110:50.59]And then shut this one off.
[110:51.49]And then that one.
[110:51.99]And then we get this one.
[110:53.52]And then we turn up this one.
[110:54.44]And that lets us go to this one.
[111:32.03]Alright, I gotta ask, why a game over there?
[111:34.85]I didn't die.
[111:35.35]That revolver is powerful.
[111:44.15]It's like an anti-tank round in there.
[111:56.70]Alright, I got it.
[112:01.30]I can't even get one to do with the first one.
[112:15.78]I hate this shit!
[112:16.96]I hate these!
[112:17.67]I don't- Look!
[112:28.83]Why can't there be one where I can just press the button really fast?
[112:32.06]I'm so good at those.
[112:33.00]Fuck!
[112:46.36]Fuck!
[112:50.11]Come on.
[112:52.01]Come on, this is it.
[113:01.99]Shit, he's dead again.
[113:05.99]He's fucking gonna die again.
[113:14.40]Got it.
[113:19.06]What?
[113:19.60]I didn't get it.
[113:23.20]I hate these things.
[113:24.08]It's just like I don't want to sit there and press like the light button.
[113:27.16]I hate this shit.
[113:29.40]I hate these like the press the button to close the door, two doors open.
[113:32.84]I mean, I just close them all.
[113:34.70]Just smear your hand on it.
[113:36.50]What's this?
[113:50.17]Alright, why is the game frozen?
[114:11.04]You're watching me.
[114:13.20]Alright.
[114:13.76]I just hate these.
[114:15.32]I'm so bad at these.
[114:17.88]Why can't we want him to be singing to the microphone well?
[114:21.35]Why can't there be a rock band-esque hold?
[114:24.05]Like... A. An A note.
[114:26.67]You know?
[114:28.59]I can just do that so easily.
[114:29.67]I can't.
[114:30.07]This stuff is hard for me.
[114:53.84]God damn it.
[114:54.98]I can't do them.
[114:56.70]I just hate them.
[115:17.09]I fucking hate these.
[115:18.65]I hate these!
[115:23.29]Little, like, little tinkering puzzle.
[115:24.80]Little tinker and blow the guy's fucking brains out.
[115:27.28]How about a sprinting competition?
[115:31.32]We sprint as fast as we can.
[115:32.52]I'll beat you every time.
[115:33.74]All of you.
[115:42.51]It's not timed?
[115:46.53]Oh.
[116:01.51]I can't wait to hear.
[116:02.11]Oh, so it's not time.
[116:07.21]So it hits the two around it, which will put one up top.
[116:12.26]Then we go like this.
[116:22.83]Can't see basic patterns.
[116:25.88]Yeah, I didn't go to math school.
[116:27.40]Okay?
[116:28.68]I went to swim wicked fast school.
[116:30.76]I can do that.
[116:34.39]Alright, so then this one... So this will light... This will turn this one off.
[116:41.71]And it will light this one up.
[116:42.75]And turn this one off.
[116:43.67]So this will be lit up.
[116:46.39]And if we do this one... No, we need to do left.
[116:53.13]I want to press... Are you sure it's not timed?
[116:59.55]Just press left and right.
[117:00.82]What do you mean?
[117:01.62]It's not timed.
[117:06.72]Alright, so then this one, if we press this one, it'll get rid of this one and turn this one on.
[117:10.26]And then we need to turn on... Somebody said no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, what?
[117:18.86]And then this.
[117:21.63]And then this, and then this.
[117:22.99]No, fuck.
[117:27.40]You guys want to hear something funny?
[117:28.80]I have pretended to do these since I was a child.
[117:34.16]You know when you get presented with one of these things and you do it, you just go, oh yeah, I guessed this one and the guy guessed that one and then this one.
[117:40.08]Oh, I got it, yeah.
[117:41.08]I just have pretended to know how to do that.
[117:42.66]Okay.
[117:59.81]Making it, yeah, oh yeah, absolutely just faking it.
[118:03.59]I get how this works, but I don't care enough to give it the time necessary to do it.
[118:08.28]That's why I never do these puzzles.
[118:09.52]Because I'm just like, oh, I press a button and two of them pop up adjacent.
[118:13.20]I don't care.
[118:13.62]Fuck this.
[118:14.42]Skip this.
[118:14.84]Rip it in half and throw it in the trash.
[118:18.09]Or I just press a bunch of buttons and eventually get it and then people go, oh, he got it.
[118:21.13]Yeah, I know.
[118:31.24]Hold on one sec.
[118:41.87]You know what to do.
[118:48.39]Go on.
[118:50.26]Look on the screen.
[119:08.90]Alright, right in the middle.
[119:11.40]Right in the middle, sounds good.
[119:13.76]Alright, now what?
[119:23.68]Imagine a guy, he's on the... Yeah, screw you, Jigsaw, you maniac.
[119:30.32]Stay right there, George, I'm gonna help you.
[119:33.89]Start live stream.
[119:36.17]Hey, hey guys.

[119:37.94]I need your help.
[119:39.00]I'm inside this room right here.
[119:40.64]And this guy is going to gun his mouth over here.
[119:42.28]But this is a little puzzle that I'm going to get.
[119:43.88]Can you guys, we need to click maps on this shit and you guys can help me out here.
[119:48.24]In the middle again.
[119:48.85]Let's just put it back to where it was.
[120:13.99]What are you doing?
[120:20.16]That's Not oh you met you.
[120:23.54]Oh, you don't care.
[120:24.46]You're just drawing a dick.
[120:25.54]I get it.
[120:25.84]Okay.
[120:26.32]What can you please help me?
[120:27.74]Oh?
[120:40.23]No helpers.
[120:44.80]Okay, looks like we got middle.
[120:49.66]Thank you.
[120:54.29]Okay.
[120:55.47]Again, we're back to where we were before.
[120:57.07]What are we doing?
[121:00.98]Please only vote once.
[121:08.21]Just click on every square till you get it.
[121:09.95]That's what I typically do, but when there's a gun in a guy's mouth, I can't do that.
[121:25.61]No, he doesn't know what to do.
[121:26.65]He has no idea.
[121:27.55]He doesn't know what to do.
[121:29.21]Okay.
[121:31.09]Okay, that was close.
[121:33.29]Got you guys.
[121:33.93]Ooh, I burned you guys.
[121:35.62]You have to.

[121:38.01]Oh!
[121:38.17]Pretender!
[121:38.79]Pretender!
[121:39.35]He looked it up?
[122:03.22]No, I did the thing that I said I always do.
[122:05.35]I just just fucking hit random buttons until it wins.
[122:18.41]Come on.
[122:21.09]Oh, I was on the phone.
[122:22.53]Does this ever happen to you?
[122:24.13]I'm going to break you down a scenario.
[122:26.91]Anytime you talk on the phone to anyone, that's another person that you do not know.
[122:31.72]How do you typically talk?
[122:34.31]Hey, yeah, okay, yeah, the appointment is for next week?
[122:37.25]Sounds great.
[122:37.79]Yeah, I'm a normal person just like you.
[122:39.69]We're both just, we both talk, we both pretend like we're humans.
[122:45.60]Sometimes you accidentally let slip out being a human being on the phone.
[122:50.80]That happened to me the other day.
[122:53.58]I was calling about a package that I got.
[122:56.68]And I was like, oh, yeah, the pa- hi, how you doing?
[122:58.79]Yeah, I'm just calling about the package that I was supposed to get.
[123:01.21]Um, it's, it, you know, it, it, it was, it was a little late.
[123:03.61]I'm just seeing if it was, if it's still on time.
[123:05.03]It's gonna be coming on time.
[123:05.93]Oh, let me look that up for you.
[123:07.75]Sure, uh, what, give me the, you know, tracking info.
[123:10.31]Okay, cool, we're both talking to like this.
[123:12.29]Sounds awesome.
[123:13.65]So, um, fucking, uh, um, so what time, sorry about that.
[123:19.05]Um, I'm really sorry for the profanity.
[123:20.83]I'm really, what's happening?
[123:25.50]I said, fuck it.
[123:27.38]I was like, ah, so fucking... What's the time frame I could... Sorry, I'm really sorry.
[123:33.08]Sorry I was just a person for like a second.
[123:34.66]Sorry I was a human.
[123:35.82]We pretend to not be humans when we talk to strangers.
[123:47.73]The thing is that the person on the phone was just like...
[123:52.93]What the heck?
[123:53.85]Okay, I'm coming.
[124:19.10]A guy holding a crutch.
[124:20.64]I don't think I trust the guy just walking around with a crutch.
[124:36.20]Like, you didn't find a better weapon than that than just a, like, wooden, plastic, metal crutch?
[124:45.22]Get her out of there.
[124:45.92]I can't step over there.
[124:47.20]I have to find... I have to do like a puzzle or something.

[126:47.85]Takes three minutes to make a hot pocket.
[126:49.59]No, it does not.
[126:51.69]Three and a half.
[126:53.59]Does it?
[126:53.89]I thought it took like two.
[126:56.00]Well, see, the problem is you're not using the crisping sleeve.
[126:59.86]You just put it on a plate.
[127:00.72]You just microwave it.
[127:02.54]No, you're doing it wrong.
[127:08.32]Streamer rushes Hot Pocket viewer.
[127:10.22]No, I'm not.
[127:10.72]I'm giving him plenty of time.
[127:18.59]The problem is you're eating a Hot Pocket.
[127:20.11]I mean, yeah, that's true.
[127:23.35]I don't really like them that much.
[127:28.66]You know, I used to eat the... Wasn't there a pepperoni meatball one?
[127:33.95]Yeah, I used to eat the pepperoni meatball and marinara one all the time.

[127:49.68]I'm just giving you $50.
[127:52.68]Minty Fox, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[127:54.26]I mean, no.
[127:58.49]Thank you, Minty, for the 50 fucking dollars.
[128:01.03]They say play it.
[128:02.48]I'm not sure what I'm supposed to play.
[128:04.60]But thanks a huge amount of money.
[128:06.74]We also have five community subs from Malcolm.
[128:08.88]We had 10 community subs from Austin Atlantis and five community subs from Clore, who we got earlier.
[128:17.04]Oh, talking about Exanima.
[128:20.70]I'm gonna.
[128:21.54]Ban me for saying that.
[128:22.40]I should time me out for five seconds.
[128:25.63]Hey, Illest Gambino, thanks for the five community subs.
[128:28.97]Pretty cool, thanks a lot.
[128:30.51]Alright, you back?
[128:37.84]Like, what if this person just went to go make a Hot Pocket and they were like, nah, the Saw II stream sucks, I'm just gonna go, you know, I'm gonna go play ball.
[128:43.66]And then what if they just don't come back?
[128:46.91]We gave them all this time.
[128:47.73]Alright, that's, alright, that's fine.
[128:53.15]That's enough.
[128:56.34]Alright, what's wrong with my neck?
[129:07.52]Missing something?
[129:08.67]Rescue the woman trapped in the box.
[129:10.83]Locate the pool pump to drain the pool.
[129:18.87]That kind of makes me want a hot pocket.
[129:21.57]Is that weird?
[129:24.25]I don't like Hot Pockets for one very specific reason.
[129:28.21]Because they're too hot to eat, and then by the time that they're not hot to eat, they're too cold to enjoy.
[129:34.03]It sucks all around.
[129:36.41]Okay, press the... That's very hot.
[129:52.56]It's very, very hot.
[129:53.60]Okay.
[129:54.46]Keep clean around this dirty laundry.
[130:00.04]I stolen bit.
[130:01.02]What did I steal that from?
[130:08.18]I stole that from somebody?
[130:09.40]I mean, it's an easy joke.
[130:12.24]It's an easy reference to make.
[130:15.22]You stole that from Jim Gaffigan.
[130:20.53]I... No, I didn't.
[130:22.79]I did not steal anything from Jim Gaffigan.
[130:25.55]He did.
[130:26.53]He stole so many things from Jim Gaffigan.
[130:29.67]I didn't steal anything.
[130:32.53]Oh, that's just, that's baloney.
[130:37.34]If anything, I have all my material completely not made.
[130:41.28]It's all mine.
[130:44.16]He really thinks that, doesn't he?
[130:46.26]Thank you.
[130:54.14]Watch out!
[131:03.32]Somebody said, who the fuck is Jim Gaffigan?
[131:09.51]He's a senator.
[131:11.01]He's a senator from, I think, New Hampshire or something.
[131:18.59]Need a gear.
[131:26.17]No, there's no gears.
[131:29.75]Who the fuck is Jim Caffigan?
[131:33.18]Oh, I just got really, really sad.
[131:36.82]Oh.
[131:38.64]Someday in the next 10 to 20 years, it's going to be... I don't know.
[131:44.52]It's not going to be Twitch anymore.
[131:45.57]It'll be like Itch.
[131:46.37]It'll be Itch.TV or something.
[131:49.55]I'm going to get hoed like 20 years from now on the new streaming platform, aren't I?
[131:55.64]One of you guys that's, like, 15, 16, 20 years old, whatever, 30, 20, 20 years old, you're gonna, 10 years from now, you're gonna make it big.
[132:04.58]And then I'm gonna be gone, I'm gonna be retired in, like, 15, 20 years or something.
[132:09.36]And you'll make, like, a, look at me!
[132:11.74]And everyone's gonna, and your chat's all gonna be younger, and they're gonna go, what the fuck are you doing?
[132:16.04]Oh, that's a, that's a, a, a, a, Jerm, Jerm, Jerm, Jerm, Jerm Elbertson bit.
[132:19.06]Who the fuck is that guy?
[132:23.36]And then you're all going to watch the videos of mine that I made and like, oh, cringe.
[132:27.38]This guy's wicked cringe.
[132:29.76]Oh, my God.
[132:30.32]People watch this?
[132:31.26]How did they?
[132:32.24]Oh, boy.
[132:32.50]I must have been young.
[132:33.50]People must have been young.
[132:36.04]It's okay.
[132:38.80]It's alright.
[132:41.64]Fuck.
[132:42.60]But we're here now.
[132:43.96]We're here now.
[132:49.92]Me and you.
[132:50.38]Just you and me.
[132:53.99]What the hell was the point of sneaking through here?
[133:00.31]Is there a valve here or something?
[133:05.99]What was the point of this?
[133:16.00]Why would they say it in 30 years?
[133:17.12]It's already cringe.
[133:30.54]Now it is.
[133:33.38]Quick, everybody go.
[133:41.05]Oh my god.
[133:41.61]Just give me a valve so I can screw the thing in.
[133:48.62]You're watching this in the shower?
[133:49.74]Okay.
[133:55.02]How are you doing that?
[134:07.34]Uh, did anybody see?
[134:09.12]It's probably going to be in the washing machine or something stupid.
[134:12.28]It is.
[134:13.96]It's actually in the fucking washing machine.
[134:27.85]Borderlands joke.
[134:32.03]The rats are the best part of this game so far.
[134:44.57]Okay.
[134:48.45]Just get burnt by the steam and grab the key.
[134:57.66]He's really going to be pissed off when I gently lean my face in here not too close.
[135:02.78]And it's super relaxing.
[135:05.65]He's not going to be happy about that.
[135:15.74]Now the whole place is steam.
[135:23.95]Okay.
[135:25.93]Got the key.
[135:29.91]I'd rather boil water.
[135:33.65]Is that like a steam joke maybe?
[135:34.93]I think that's a steam joke.
[135:47.16]We're good.
[135:48.68]I have the key.
[135:55.87]Anything else?
[136:01.01]Couldn't you use the crutch to hook the key?
[136:05.58]Yes, you could.
[136:07.94]You absolutely could do that.
[136:16.48]But what if you drop it?
[136:17.28]What if you don't get it well enough?
[136:18.68]Then you're just dead.
[136:19.26]Okay, more of this bullshit.
[136:29.23]Can't wait!
[136:44.48]Who else wishes they could live here?
[136:48.64]Live where?
[136:57.93]What the fuck is this?
[137:06.58]My mouse just fell at the same time.
[137:11.69]I hooked my mouse with my leg and it landed at the same time.
[137:17.12]And it made a clicking noise too.
[137:22.55]I don't know why that's more funny to me than anything else.
[137:25.39]That's a me thing here.
[137:28.57]You guys didn't get to experience that.
[137:29.83]I'm sorry.
[137:30.21]You couldn't.
[137:43.12]Guess you had to be there.
[137:44.08]Turn the facecam on?
[137:51.22]You will get the facecam, maybe.
[137:54.47]If you're good.
[137:56.23]You gonna be good?
[138:05.05]Ow!
[138:10.69]Uh, I'm turning the gamma up on this thing.
[138:14.81]You know what I mean?
[138:16.29]It's time.
[138:17.03]It's time to turn up the gamma.
[138:18.09]Give me a sec.
[138:29.30]Turn up the gamma.
[138:35.45]Ow.
[138:36.75]How is that cheating?
[138:45.49]Oh, I'm just making my hot pocket real quick.
[138:48.77]This is way too dark.
[138:49.63]There's something going on here.
[138:52.94]Oh my god, that's a million times better.
[138:55.18]I can actually see the puzzles now.
[138:58.80]Imagine actually being able to see instead of what it was, which was this.
[139:02.74]I can see the doors.
[139:11.00]Thank you.
[139:11.71]Okay, let's go.
[139:20.47]And you can see, too.
[139:22.21]No wonder everybody was like, dude, veto this.
[139:23.91]I can't see anything.
[139:35.74]Oh, shit.
[139:35.96]This is wicked ugly now.
[139:45.58]This is way uglier now.
[139:51.10]Still Vito.
[139:51.88]Why would I... I'm not Vito.
[139:53.20]It's been two and a half hours.
[139:54.36]There's no Vito here.
[139:57.07]No.
[139:57.87]Oh, I am... You made me play this.
[140:01.47]You said play this game.
[140:02.61]I want you to pull... It's Saw 2 Waiting Room.
[140:04.63]You remember that one?
[140:18.19]We're sorry.
[140:23.93]No, I'm not done.
[140:25.21]I'm actually enjoying this.
[140:27.04]There he is.
[140:27.50]Oh, we just had him.
[140:34.44]Key to survival lies within.
[140:36.12]Okay, is it here?
[140:37.42]Is it here?
[140:40.38]Is it here?
[140:41.20]Four?
[140:41.86]Is it two?
[140:44.44]Question mark.
[140:46.86]Wait, box nine.
[140:49.26]Okay, five, eight, four, two.
[140:52.44]That's it, right?
[140:54.88]Oh shit, wait.
[140:55.68]Five.
[140:56.04]Same number.
[141:23.88]Same number, same explosion joke, right?
[141:29.66]That's so stupid.
[141:31.20]I love it.
[141:32.72]I love it.
[141:34.43]Just don't ever click on five again.
[141:35.97]It's the explosion number, yeah.
[141:47.47]Okay.
[141:51.19]Close it.
[141:52.01]Here we go.
[141:54.14]So... The key to survival lies within.
[141:59.00]Within me.
[142:01.12]Within you.
[142:04.74]Is it... Is it... Nine?
[142:07.67]Is it here?
[142:10.61]Number four.
[142:28.07]Imagine not having infinite lives.
[142:30.45]That's just where the character dies in the story.
[142:36.20]What's the actual percentage chance of somebody actually getting through Jigsaw's bullshit?
[142:45.32]This is probably the five millionth person he's had to try do this.
[142:52.67]You know how much of a pain in the ass it probably was for the last guy when he set up four miles in eight warehouses worth of traps?
[142:59.45]And the guy died at five in the first room.
[143:04.76]Do you get to write all that other shit off on your taxes?
[143:22.45]Okay.
[143:27.86]Uh, is... Okay.
[143:28.96]Is it the shotgun shells on my back?
[143:30.32]Is that what it is?
[143:32.30]That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[143:35.46]That's nine.
[143:36.26]There is no nine.
[143:36.94]Okay, there's a nine right here.
[143:56.64]Just the amount of people that died to this one.
[143:58.42]Okay.
[144:07.64]Lies within.
[144:09.40]It's not the shotgun shells.
[144:13.18]It's not five.
[144:14.74]Look, I opened one box the first time and it didn't blow up.
[144:17.90]What box was that?
[144:30.66]I think this one.
[144:36.10]Which number was it?
[144:36.86]What did I open first?
[144:41.95]It's not just in order, right?
[144:43.67]It's not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[144:44.25]It's not, right?
[144:44.87]The wires?
[144:55.73]Oh shit, you're right.
[144:56.95]Okay, that one goes to nine.
[144:59.00]And then it goes over here to... Here, right?
[145:05.49]This is one.
[145:20.60]Open the ones that... Yeah, but I figured it was like that's how you deactivate them.
[145:24.56]To open the one where the cord was going in.
[145:26.38]Nice Elmo laugh.
[145:32.37]For some reason it was like, oh, that's like deactivate them.
[145:34.47]I don't know.
[145:37.77]But why would that deactivate them?
[145:39.22]It would activate them.
[145:40.12]So just open the ones that are not connected to the wires.
[145:44.19]It has nothing to do with how many shells I have on my back or if there's something in me, within you.
[145:49.25]No, don't even... Who cares about the writing on the wall?
[145:59.66]Okay.
[146:00.62]Do not open five.
[146:04.79]Do not open... Eight's okay.
[146:09.57]Eight is safe.
[146:10.89]Eight is safe.
[146:12.59]There's no cord going in there.
[146:15.24]That one right there is wrapping around it.
[146:17.08]It's not going in there.
[146:18.02]There's no cord going into 8.
[146:20.54]Impossible.
[146:20.92]There's no cord going into 8 or 7.
[146:22.08]Because that's going all the way over here.
[146:29.70]See?
[146:30.02]It's still going.
[146:30.64]It's still going.
[146:31.06]That one goes all the way over.
[146:31.82]Okay.
[146:33.98]What cord is going into 8?
[146:35.23]That one is.
[146:35.79]Okay.
[146:36.77]Excuse me.
[146:37.51]No cord going into 7.
[146:40.83]Thank you.
[146:41.95]Oh, I won.
[146:50.63]That's it?
[146:50.91]That's it?
[146:54.11]There's an 8 out of 10 link here?
[147:00.75]That took so long.
[147:01.91]Yeah, it did, but what do you want me to do?
[147:10.60]What is it?
[147:10.96]What is this?
[147:11.62]I'm gonna press this button?
[147:19.32]I'm going to press this button.
[147:28.38]Well, that's unfair because I just was able to see in the last five minutes.
[147:44.85]Bring the elevator down.
[147:49.91]Come on, dude.
[147:50.93]What's the point?
[147:53.72]Alright, elevator.
[147:54.38]Get it on the X. Get that pump.
[148:13.19]I'm here!
[148:13.75]I thought that was the girl.
[148:19.66]Uh, what Iron Man character was that?
[148:21.24]Because there's no way a human could do that.
[148:23.02]That dude went through five different stories through the ground.
[148:29.30]Okay, uh, alright, I'm gonna go in here.
[148:38.65]Move!
[148:44.48]Please take my groceries up to the seventh floor apartment before time runs out.
[148:55.77]So funny.
[148:57.07]It was just, it was smooth.
[149:02.85]That was showing off.
[149:05.05]Oh my God.
[149:05.77]Why is all the broken glass here?
[149:07.96]What is this?
[149:24.38]No, I have to build something.
[149:26.06]What does he want me to do?
[149:40.86]What the fuck is going on?
[149:43.10]Ow!
[149:57.74]Oh, it's changing.
[149:58.40]Alright.
[149:58.78]What's the TV that tells me what happens?
[150:07.39]Oh, no.
[150:08.71]This doesn't... Okay.
[150:09.97]This one doesn't blow up, though.
[150:13.64]Right?
[150:13.78]There's no gun in anybody's mouth.
[150:14.94]I just had it.
[150:18.24]I just had it.
[150:18.64]I just had it.
[150:22.73]What did... What does that do?
[150:33.49]Change.
[150:35.47]Change!
[150:47.90]Jump over it.
[150:48.54]What the fuck?
[150:49.42]You just reach over it.
[150:52.12]It already triggered.
[150:53.92]That's gonna hurt me, isn't it?
[150:55.54]No, it's not.
[150:57.62]So, wait.
[151:00.16]How do I reset?
[151:00.60]Can I reset this?
[151:03.21]Just go.
[151:03.77]Go?
[151:06.07]What?
[151:08.47]Oh, that one was easy.
[151:21.78]Reset Randy.
[151:22.74]Reset Randy.
[151:32.60]I'm dumb.
[151:40.00]Okay.
[151:40.46]Now we have to push this somewhere.
[151:45.44]Straight through.
[151:45.92]Okay.
[151:55.87]Wait.
[151:56.55]Let me get some of these.
[152:04.61]Through the next door.
[152:07.23]I have to open it.
[152:07.93]Would you guys be able to stand this stream if that's how I talk the whole time?
[152:17.18]No?
[152:18.00]Maybe a little?
[152:26.76]I don't know if that's supposed to be scary, but that guy was not scary.
[152:32.95]Just walking over here.
[152:45.50]Okay, where's the TV that explains this?
[152:50.72]We got snake, hand... Snake, hand, knife, skull.
[152:57.45]But it's actually hand...
[153:01.28]and knife and knife ah and and knife skull snake and knife skull snake knife skull snake snake oh what's in the box
[153:36.44]A nail.
[153:38.84]Cool.
[153:40.80]That was great.
[153:43.02]He's done it.
[153:43.48]Do it again.
[153:48.80]Slow down.
[153:53.24]There we go.
[153:57.40]All the drag marks.
[154:02.71]What's the dead space thing on your back?
[154:06.27]Those are oxygen tablets.
[154:07.37]Isn't that how it works in Dead Space?
[154:11.28]That's your oxygen level?
[154:20.99]O2 tabs.
[154:23.27]Alright, we gotta follow the track.
[154:24.95]That guy ran away.
[154:26.81]Where did he go?
[154:27.27]I don't know.
[154:32.05]Okay, so this has to go through... I need to push that thing.
[154:40.21]Where... Hold on, I gotta move that... Ugh.
[154:44.09]I gotta drag that thing across the whole game, don't I?
[154:46.16]Play any Zelda game?
[154:57.24]Um, I...
[155:00.18]I kind of don't, I don't, no, not really.
[155:03.24]I, look, I love Zelda.
[155:04.50]I think it's a cool franchise, but no, I'm, no, I'm not, not on stream.
[155:17.43]Maybe one day.
[155:18.98]Maybe.
[155:19.30]0876. 0876.
[155:28.65]I don't hate Zelda.
[155:29.77]Why are you guys saying I hate Zelda?
[155:36.45]Play Dead Space.
[155:41.02]You know, I might.
[155:43.42]It's really, you might see Dead Space here this coming in the next week or two.
[155:46.64]I don't know, maybe.
[155:48.72]The one problem I have with Dead Space...
[155:51.46]Is I have already... I've never played it.
[155:54.14]I've maybe played like a little bit of somebody's playthrough.
[155:57.02]But I have watched somebody play through pretty much that entire game more than once.
[156:00.18]So, you know.
[156:06.67]Maybe.
[156:15.96]No, not a streamer.
[156:17.64]This is years ago.
[156:23.34]You might see it.
[156:24.60]Possible.
[156:36.84]He's too scared to play it himself.
[156:40.86]It's a pretty scary game.
[156:47.65]Oh, VR, right.
[156:48.39]Yeah, so VR.
[156:49.03]I'm going to do VR scary games.
[156:54.22]Hold on.
[156:58.58]I have two or three horror games that are VR.
[157:01.88]That'll be for one of the nights coming up this week.
[157:04.87]Probably, if not tomorrow, then the next day.
[157:09.71]That's right.
[157:10.71]Scary VR games.
[157:12.21]Coming.
[157:14.89]Either tomorrow or the next day.
[157:28.18]Soon, yeah.
[157:29.28]Within the next two days.
[157:32.08]I was gonna do it today.
[157:34.22]The reason why I didn't do it today is because I've been very tight recently.
[157:41.79]I had some body work done.
[157:46.09]I've been mushed around and moved around a lot with my problem.
[157:51.69]And, uh, yeah, I've been pretty sore over the last probably six or seven days.
[157:57.33]Like, at least the last three days.
[157:59.67]What happened?
[158:00.11]This guy's in the room now?
[158:01.49]Oh, he ran through.
[158:02.33]Alright, come and get me!
[158:14.92]I'm just trying to find a good place to Estus.
[158:17.48]He hit me?
[158:32.44]You died to ramming Randy.
[158:36.01]Oh, why did I lean back so fast?
[158:41.83]No, I got to checkpoint.
[158:46.63]Dying means I die and I turn the game off.
[158:48.15]Alright, where's the X?
[158:57.96]There's an X on a wall somewhere.
[159:02.14]He needs to ram into, uh, I'm gonna, I guess it's like, not there.
[159:06.02]How about right here?
[159:07.84]Really?
[159:12.92]I'm in the wall.
[159:23.85]What the fuck?
[159:24.73]He pivoted so fast.
[159:27.27]We can end this.
[159:34.42]You get it?
[159:35.46]You didn't get it?
[159:36.04]Oh my fucking god!
[159:59.47]Somebody said, me, when somebody takes my McDonald's!
[160:02.95]Oh, me when somebody steals a fry out of my box.
[160:06.73]Come on.
[160:09.81]That's so stupid.
[160:15.46]Oh, me when a friend asks for one of my king size Reese's.
[160:19.72]There's only four in there, man.
[160:21.30]There should be eight.
[160:22.71]They should put two on top of each other.
[160:24.13]It's not a king size.
[160:25.03]That's barely anything.
[160:34.70]King size.
[160:39.78]Run into the fucking wall.
[160:41.10]Come on.
[160:48.86]No, I don't want to stick my... Ugh.
[161:03.09]Ugh.
[161:08.89]How many times does he have to do it?
[161:13.74]Are you fucking kidding me?
[161:21.28]I just got Dark Souls 2'd.
[161:22.75]What are you, a hide knight?
[161:27.13]Give me a break.
[161:43.09]Okay, I'm getting real sick of this.
[161:48.81]Can I smash him in the head with this?
[162:13.46]That was not a ram.
[162:15.46]That was a chest bump.
[162:16.76]Barely.
[162:17.15]He faked you out.
[162:33.66]Ah.
[162:41.87]The idea is that he's hitting you with his head, right?
[162:44.17]That's what we're led to believe here.
[162:45.24]Play Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC.
[162:48.82]1, 2, 3.
[162:49.02]I mean, the 1, 2, 3 at the end actually made me read that, so that's pretty good work.
[163:00.03]I'm gonna play the tape.
[163:02.05]What does the tape say?
[163:03.75]Hello, Patrick.
[163:06.67]When you were a small child, your father used to cut
[163:12.96]These people are not... These are not like, saveable people!
[163:20.98]You stabbed children with knives, Patrick!
[163:24.21]You... You ate children!
[163:27.37]You murdered children!
[163:29.61]I swear to God, didn't they like... You did drugs for like a week or something?
[163:33.45]Like, what is all this?
[163:41.53]Break that!
[163:43.41]Oh, he was the one that was stabbed.
[163:45.00]So what the hell are you doing, Jigsaw?
[163:46.58]Fuck off!
[163:56.04]He didn't hit the wall.
[164:06.09]Can I just walk through?
[164:25.37]so I I just can I be honest I'm doing this right right I have to try to get him to hit the door a few times the uh crack a few times this isn't a situation where like I can't read the analog clock right you would tell me I would know
[164:48.05]Let's get the abridged version, please I got one Oh my god
[165:25.00]Why can you do that?
[165:26.46]Why can you do that?
[165:28.06]That's not fair!
[165:44.45]You have to make him run into the mattress.
[165:47.51]No, he already ran into the mattress like four times.
[165:58.74]Just do the skip.
[166:01.94]Hey, how's your Halloween week going so far?
[166:04.46]Hopefully good.
[166:14.93]Damn it, I tried to time it.
[166:16.05]Actually, I did time it pretty well to the end of the cutscene.
[166:20.57]Move!
[166:23.99]Circle the other way.
[166:24.71]I can't move right now.
[166:36.99]He's still running, I can hear him.
[166:48.63]Okay, he hit me and the wall.
[167:15.30]easy oh my god first scary part of the game was right there you can't use wilhelm for every scream yep you can if you don't pay for any others
[167:50.09]Got a new link.
[167:50.65]Give me one sec.
[167:51.61]Let me get through the balance beam section.
[167:53.29]Sure thing.
[167:53.67]I'll open that up, dude.
[167:54.49]Okay.
[168:01.29]Okay, but why is this a big deal?
[168:19.98]That is too dark.
[168:20.66]This is so dark.
[168:21.38]I'm going to turn the game up.
[168:22.20]It's ugly now.
[168:25.28]Yeah.
[168:26.64]Take a selfie of your face in the dark with the flash on.
[168:32.66]Look at it and you tell me what you think.
[168:40.30]How did you click the wrong one?
[168:41.30]Why are you guys linking a picture of my bulbous ass?
[168:46.66]I don't understand.
[169:00.74]I mean, it's definitely photoshopped.
[169:02.70]I'm... I do have a big ass.
[169:05.21]But it's absolutely... I think that's photoshopped.
[169:07.39]I don't think that's real.
[169:16.78]Not at first try!
[169:25.60]Prove it.
[169:28.55]Arrow... No.
[169:32.01]It's probably like, do I really need to prove it?
[169:35.93]It's probably four or five hundred thousand images of a screenshot of me, my ass or something.
[169:43.58]I'm sure it is.
[169:51.77]Where are they?
[169:52.51]I don't know.
[169:54.13]I don't look up pictures of my own body parts.
[169:58.19]Do you think I'm going to tell you I know where these are?
[170:00.47]I know they exist.
[170:03.67]I don't type in Jerma ass.
[170:06.05]Jerma's ass.
[170:06.77]Like, Jerma's balls.
[170:07.99]Like, I don't type.
[170:08.69]Why would I type that in?
[170:10.67]I know what they look like.
[170:11.97]I have them.
[170:12.77]I own those things.
[170:14.47]I can look in a mirror.
[170:15.21]I don't need to look up my own ass on Google.
[170:16.75]I know what it looks like.
[170:18.11]And I can look at it naked.
[170:20.33]In the mirror.
[170:25.31]What's the code?
[170:30.04]Code bullshit.
[170:31.10]Alright, did I miss something?
[170:40.05]Where's the code?
[170:45.55]Code?
[170:51.48]Ooh, what's that?
[170:53.10]What's the point?
[171:02.71]Not fair.
[171:04.31]Code.
[171:07.75]I need a code, please.
[171:12.92]I promise this is not the first Saw game, those of you guys that are asking.
[171:18.37]Wait, ooh.
[171:18.89]Alright, that's weird.
[171:25.09]Looks very similar, I know.
[171:26.19]Code.
[171:29.53]There it is.
[171:29.89]Code is... 0... 8... 7... Saw... Noose...
[171:42.27]Hatchet.
[171:46.49]Whatever that means.
[171:51.37]Saw, but what number does that mean?
[172:01.52]I think that actually, that is supposed to be a number.
[172:04.34]That's, yeah, that's zero.
[172:07.11]That's zero something seven.
[172:15.87]Or B?
[172:16.31]3?
[172:16.33]307?
[172:16.35]087.
[172:18.07]So yeah, I had it right.
[172:19.61]Okay.
[172:48.97]Wait, where the fuck was that thing?
[172:52.82]I had it right, didn't I?
[172:53.58]087.
[173:00.56]No.
[173:00.76]Was it 807?
[173:00.96]107? 107?
[173:17.28]Yeah, it's 807 then.
[173:17.96]Oh?
[173:18.02]Was it a 6?
[173:18.34]067?
[173:18.38]But how would the noose... The noose has to be a 0, right?
[173:47.61]That's not how the puzzle works.
[173:48.69]067.
[173:56.04]Oh, looking for numbers inside the room that was there?
[174:01.54]It was symbols on the walls in the room... 867?
[174:13.91]We might be overthinking this.
[174:16.30]Alright, wait, there was something on the wall where I was?
[174:25.42]Look for numbers related to the symbols.
[174:28.70]Yeah, that's, yeah.
[174:31.04]621, oh my god, please.
[174:32.04]Alright, if that's not right, I want that person timed out for five minutes.
[174:35.95]We'll see.
[174:38.37]We'll see.
[174:40.11]You get to stick around.
[174:44.83]You're about to get a five minute time out.
[174:47.07]You're out.
[174:47.69]See you later.
[174:49.99]8.15?
[174:50.27]Alright, time that person out too for five minutes.
[174:52.01]I'm not kidding you.
[174:53.11]Come on, you're holding up the stream.
[174:56.12]Oh, that person, uh, VIP that person for five minutes.
[175:08.45]Alright, now we can push this thing.
[175:21.91]Mod him.
[175:24.95]11,000 people here.
[175:25.43]Holy shit.
[175:25.91]I'm just realizing that now.
[175:26.88]Hi.
[175:27.16]What's up?
[175:28.70]What's going on?
[175:34.94]Are you being good?
[175:47.23]How was it?
[175:47.61]815, right?
[175:48.39]It had to have been something on the wall that corresponded to the symbols.
[175:53.65]And that person has a walkthrough up because they're so desperately trying to make sure that I don't stay in the same area for like 40 minutes straight that they hope that they're the one guy just putting solutions in the chat.
[176:05.90]And I get it.
[176:07.04]I actually appreciate it.
[176:14.11]What hurt me?
[176:20.13]Alright, going down.
[176:22.08]Let's get this thing and save the lady that's been trapped in that box.
[176:30.86]Everything's good.
[176:31.46]I happened to catch a stream of you playing a game that was my favorite when I was young.
[176:37.07]When you were 10.
[176:39.67]Wait, you played Saw?
[176:41.17]The video game where people get their heads cut off and their bodies maimed when you were 10?
[176:54.74]I didn't do that.
[176:55.98]Did you guys have experience with the M-rated, kind of R-rated stuff before you were like 15, 14, 13?
[177:01.11]I kind of, I didn't.
[177:02.49]When I was like 12, 13, 14?
[177:06.47]I don't think I did.
[177:11.53]Maybe like, maybe.
[177:13.03]Maybe like 14, 13, 14, 15.
[177:15.93]Like I caught an R-rated movie where I was like, oh, I snuck it.
[177:19.81]I found a way to sneak it.
[177:25.95]But, I mean, after like 15, it didn't matter anymore, I don't think.
[177:38.40]I played Silent Hill when I was 7.
[177:39.70]What did you think?
[177:43.66]You know?
[177:44.42]What did you think?
[177:45.50]Is the whole thing electrified?
[177:54.57]You must have been terrified.
[177:55.77]Hold on, I'm trying to turn the power off.
[178:09.78]I feel like Seven's a little young for that.
[178:13.99]Very.
[178:14.71]I would say very young for that.
[178:23.97]That's being a wimp?
[178:27.84]I don't think I would want to be seven years old and see, like, the godfather.
[178:34.94]I don't think I would probably be like, what's happening?
[178:36.89]Why are these people killing each other?
[178:39.39]Why is that guy exploded?
[178:40.87]I don't think I'd want to see that.
[178:57.63]My brother watched The Exorcist when he was six.
[179:03.83]I feel like that would just really mess up your little child brain.
[179:07.15]For months, potentially.
[179:09.55]Years.
[179:09.97]Are you telling me you can't- I mean, you're talking about Barney the Dinosaur and the Wiggles.
[179:22.15]To people having their heads exploded and eaten and swears and stuff.
[179:27.99]I wouldn't be able to handle that.
[179:29.63]That would freak me the fuck out.
[179:32.30]We have to eliminate him, you understand?
[179:34.76]He knows too much.
[179:36.60]But all he's done is help us.
[179:38.84]Shut up and listen, idiot.
[179:40.44]Those files his dad put together could put us in prison.
[179:44.62]Alright?
[179:45.48]And you know what they do to cops in prison.
[179:47.67]Alright, whatever you say, boss.
[179:49.41]I'm fine.
[179:50.50]Is that the guy that I let out at the beginning?
[179:51.82]Is that the guy that got out free?
[179:52.80]So there are consequences here.
[180:02.05]That guy's still here.
[180:03.51]Wait, can I open that?
[180:05.89]Nah.
[180:12.10]Uh... Whatever.
[180:17.24]Don't even care.
[180:21.89]It's kind of spooky.
[180:24.79]Ooh, I wonder if they're going to move positions.
[180:30.85]Oh, it's just... We just have to go stand in the corner.
[180:37.32]You mentioned Silent Hill.
[180:40.96]Okay, that's 9, 3, 8.
[180:45.44]Anything else or is it just 9, 3, 8?
[180:57.81]Mm-hmm.
[181:00.49]Fuck.
[181:01.27]I thought I messed it up.
[181:07.05]Game fucking stinks.
[181:09.05]Ooh, here we go.
[181:21.66]Choose the next one, please.
[181:27.85]I really wish that that would kind of come back.
[181:30.99]People say sucks a lot.
[181:32.13]Oh, this sucks.
[181:33.35]This sucks.
[181:34.23]This fucking stinks.
[181:36.35]This stinks is better.
[181:37.47]I think that I would want to see that word used more.
[181:39.77]I feel like it's underused.
[181:45.07]Okay.
[181:50.23]What was it?
[181:50.55]935?
[181:50.87]I don't remember. 938?
[181:59.35]Hey, camera.
[182:01.25]Okay.
[182:01.49]Hold on.
[182:04.59]We have quarter pills, camera pills, quarter pills, camera pills, recorder pills, camera pills.
[182:29.39]In that order.
[182:31.23]Sure thing.
[182:34.39]Recorder.
[182:34.97]Pills.
[182:37.31]Wait, how do I... Recorder.
[182:40.09]Pills.
[182:41.97]Camera.
[182:44.14]Pills.
[182:45.12]Recorder.
[182:52.36]Pills.
[182:54.84]Camera.
[182:58.35]Pills.
[183:02.35]ResidentSleeper.
[183:04.57]Snooze.
[183:06.41]Sleep.
[183:11.97]Bed.
[183:12.23]Oh, bed.
[183:15.62]Blankets.
[183:18.30]Nightlight.
[183:20.20]Okay, we're making progress here.
[183:26.88]Hills.
[183:28.44]Quarter!
[183:31.93]Sly Cooper waiting room.
[183:33.21]The same thing is going to happen.
[183:39.86]I'm going to open... I'm going to open Sly Cooper.
[183:43.42]And... Immediately.
[183:46.09]Immediately it's going to be... Sly Cooper sucks.
[183:49.43]Stupid.
[183:49.95]Fuck you for buying this.
[183:51.71]I hate you.
[184:05.81]This is so long.
[184:10.45]This is so long.
[184:15.85]This is taking forever.
[184:17.05]Hooray.
[184:28.22]That was pretty long.
[184:30.50]Can I break it?
[184:35.00]I'll go in there.
[184:39.61]If you said Sly Cooper sucked, I would just sub just to unsub.
[184:46.79]Um, but here's the thing.
[184:48.07]If you sub, you're giving me $5.
[184:51.89]When you unsub, that's you saying I'm not going to resubscribe in 30 days.
[184:57.12]So I get the money regardless.
[185:18.13]memory.
[185:21.81]It's not about the money.
[185:23.15]Sucks.
[185:24.83]Okay.
[185:25.13]Let's start in the corner.
[185:50.59]Got one.
[185:51.49]No, I don't.
[186:04.89]Oh, you have to put the piece in.
[186:06.67]Fuck.
[186:07.41]Okay, hold on.
[186:12.24]I need a left and a top.
[186:14.38]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:16.08]Left and a top, bottom in the middle.
[186:17.72]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:19.58]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:20.88]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:22.16]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:23.46]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:24.76]A left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:27.44]Left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:28.70]No.
[186:28.98]Left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:31.64]Left and a top with a bottom in the middle.
[186:33.36]There it is.
[186:33.68]Okay, we need left and a right and a top and a down.
[186:37.86]Left and a right and a top and a down.
[186:41.38]Left and right and the top and the... I want you to see my face when I die!
[187:07.01]No damage.
[187:08.53]Of course it did damage.
[187:11.91]It's not very much.
[187:13.59]It was a prop effect.
[187:20.77]I may have felt the flames a little.
[187:22.62]Okay, here we go.
[187:25.78]Got it.
[187:26.04]Alright, we need a... It's down in the corner.
[187:27.58]We need a left and a top and a bottom and a middle.
[187:42.14]It was right here, wasn't it?
[187:44.62]Or was it?
[187:47.27]Did they, does it scramble it?
[187:53.05]Scrambles it every time.
[187:58.27]Where the fuck is that piece?
[187:59.09]Come on.
[188:04.28]It's right next to it.
[188:05.18]Fuck!
[188:07.28]Okay, we need to, uh, the holding arms out.
[188:22.49]We need a top and a right and a bottom in the middle.
[188:24.33]Top and a right and a bottom in the middle.
[188:26.27]We need a left and a missing and a missing and up.
[188:30.88]Left and a missing and a missing.
[188:31.70]Okay?
[188:32.92]We need a top and a right in the middle.
[188:34.60]Top and a right coming into the middle.
[188:35.62]Done.
[188:46.57]Bump on the log of the hole in the bottom of the sea.
[188:48.29]Oh, there's a... There's a... War on the... There's a war on the hero and the free... Ah, I can't.
[189:01.17]I can do the whole thing if I'm going to do it.
[189:09.52]There is a hare on the flea, on the board, on the frog, on the log, on the bottom of the sea.
[189:13.72]Yeah.
[189:14.76]There is a ward on the hare, on the flea, on the frog, on the log, on the bog.
[189:19.72]I could do it if you gave me the whole thing.
[189:37.03]I saved you.
[189:38.11]This is a betrayal.
[189:45.04]And I aim!
[189:47.02]Wait, can I?
[189:48.46]What should I do?
[189:48.94]How many bullets does this gun have?
[190:03.19]Four.
[190:03.59]Five.
[190:06.23]Six.
[190:06.55]Okay.
[190:06.93]Alright, here we go.
[190:12.47]Right one.
[190:14.16]Two.
[190:15.57]Three.
[190:16.91]Four.
[190:17.83]Five.
[190:18.99]Six.
[190:26.73]One.
[190:27.53]Two.
[190:28.43]Three.
[190:29.91]Four.
[190:32.21]Five.
[190:32.61]Six.
[190:40.26]Oh, shit.
[190:40.50]He's moving.
[190:42.80]Where is he?
[190:49.92]Speedrunner.
[190:53.35]I can't, uh... Oh, I, wait...
[191:11.53]What?! !
[191:51.66]Okay, if you point down there, there's a subscribe button down there.
[191:55.78]You know, uh... There's also a follow button.
[191:59.20]Go ahead and follow for more puzzle gameplay.
[192:01.26]They call me the Puzzle Master.
[192:02.42]That's what they, you know, in Trivia Nights, that's what they call me.
[192:07.55]For more Puzzle Master gameplay.
[192:14.29]What door just opened?
[192:16.63]I don't know.
[192:16.97]I wasn't paying any attention.
[192:28.84]Back down.
[192:36.63]The Riddler Slug Pug.
[192:38.33]Did I delete that?
[192:45.94]Oh, you got one?
[192:46.40]Hold on.
[192:49.42]There's, uh...
[192:55.31]Okay.
[192:56.67]There's a speck on the fleck on the wing on the flea on the hair on the ward on the tail on the frog on the bump on the branch of the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea.
[193:03.36]There's a speck on the fleck on the wing on the flea on the hair on the ward on the tail on the frog in the bog in the bog.
[193:07.96]I got it the first time.
[193:10.58]I did it the first time.
[193:11.20]It's fine.
[193:16.04]Oh, yeah.
[193:16.24]We're supposed to save this person.
[193:17.44]Hurry the fuck up out there.
[193:20.58]Shut up.
[193:21.14]I'm working on it.
[193:21.72]Fuck you.
[193:22.42]Get me out of here.
[193:25.05]You're the one in the box, lady.
[193:26.27]That's not a good bargaining chip.
[193:31.48]To say fuck you to the person that's the only hope you have.
[193:38.12]If I get a choice between you and the puppy, I'm saving the puppy.
[193:40.46]Just want to let you know.
[193:41.10]Can I not go down?
[193:56.12]Okay, that hurt, I guess.
[194:18.21]Anything to say, Jigsaw?
[194:31.01]You pollute your body with drugs and you sell your morals on the street corner for whatever you can get.
[194:38.40]Detective Tapp gave you a second chance.
[194:42.14]An escape from your addiction.
[194:46.30]But after his death you slipped back into your old ways, didn't you?
[194:51.32]So I put you in a money machine.
[194:54.68]Catch as many as you can get, you'll get a third chance.
[195:02.23]What is this?
[195:10.86]Move.
[195:15.16]Uh, okay.
[195:16.70]I guess I... Reset.
[195:19.45]Oh.
[195:34.84]What am I moving?
[195:40.70]I need to... How do I get over the other... Can I stop them?
[195:52.66]I'm filling it up faster.
[195:54.43]What the hell just happened?
[196:01.41]You're fine.
[196:01.87]Just hold on a minute.
[196:12.72]There it is.
[196:13.90]What?
[196:28.15]Just hold on.
[196:28.89]Hold your breath.
[196:29.65]The average human can hold their breath for 60 seconds.
[196:32.43]I got you.
[196:42.09]You good?
[196:43.41]Why is it not?
[196:43.91]I don't understand.
[196:45.36]I can't press any buttons.
[196:46.38]You're doing great.
[196:50.04]You have to line them up at the same time.
[196:51.48]Haven't I done that like three times now?
[196:53.04]You're doing really good.
[196:54.42]Holy shit.
[196:55.12]We got a Navy SEAL here.
[196:56.32]I'm doing this obviously completely wrong.
[197:09.35]Just hold it there?
[197:10.07]I can't though.
[197:17.61]What am I supposed to do?
[197:22.16]Sink them.
[197:22.70]I already did that.
[197:24.62]It lined up and the thing could go right down the middle.
[197:36.00]You're still alright.
[197:42.73]They all have to be just going at the same time.
[197:47.55]I thought it was they all had to line up right in the middle so that the water can just go through.
[198:04.58]Didn't I do that already on the second one?
[198:07.00]They were lined up correctly.
[198:09.62]It needs to be perfect.
[198:10.94]Oh, okay.
[198:11.98]Well, that's stupid.
[198:13.14]Nothing's perfect.
[198:21.70]Here we go.
[198:29.77]Ready?
[198:34.31]Nothing's perfect.
[198:42.88]Almost.
[198:43.18]A little more.
[198:43.81]Alright, nothing's perfect.
[198:51.05]Done.
[198:51.77]I did that last time.
[198:52.99]I'm mad about that.
[198:54.09]I did that last time and it didn't work and I was like, well, this doesn't make any sense.
[198:56.96]Might have to try something different.
[199:20.18]You got it, you got it, you can hold your breath.
[199:26.28]We have time when you start holding your breath.
[199:28.06]Fuck.
[199:36.03]No.
[199:37.85]No, she's gonna drown.
[199:42.37]The bottom was not even eyes off too.
[199:52.18]Come on, that's it!
[199:54.12]What?
[200:12.01]Do it!
[200:23.10]He's fucking dead.
[200:34.73]Why?
[200:35.95]Why?
[200:43.67]Why?
[200:43.89]Line them up so they all go and they all line up at the right point at the same time.
[200:48.38]She's drowning.
[200:49.74]Scary shit, isn't it?
[200:59.52]Does this game have a two?
[201:01.70]That's too high.
[201:19.85]I'm getting it this time.
[201:20.73]I'm doing it.
[201:21.19]I swear to God.
[201:34.35]What?
[201:34.49]That doesn't count?
[201:35.13]I have to let it go.
[201:37.63]Okay.
[201:37.89]Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
[201:48.86]Time.
[201:49.10]Time.
[201:49.34]Got plenty of time.
[201:54.64]No.
[201:54.80]Wait.
[201:54.96]We got... Wait.
[201:55.52]Hold on.
[201:55.78]Take it easy.
[201:57.35]Okay.
[201:57.47]Okay.
[202:15.63]Get the fuck out of, get the fuck out of, get the fuck out of, get the fuck out of here.
[202:22.48]Are you alright?
[202:24.96]Do you know your name?
[202:27.26]You know your name?
[202:28.80]I'm Sarah.
[202:30.22]Your father and I, we, I was an informant for him.
[202:34.83]I'm sorry, Sarah.
[202:36.17]But what did Jigsaw mean about my dad giving you a second chance?
[202:40.17]He was kind.
[202:43.83]These slippers are really comfortable, by the way.
[202:51.36]Been wearing them the whole time.
[202:55.00]Shit.
[203:06.25]I did just save her life.
[203:08.33]That's true.
[203:12.49]Wait, I'm not done.
[203:15.09]I'm not done with you.
[203:20.95]I said I'm... Oh, come on.
[203:25.23]Oh, they trap you in here until she leaves.
[203:37.88]Saw 2?
[203:41.17]So, after Saw 2, they didn't make another game.
[203:45.69]Five more movies came out, but nope, they weren't going to keep up with this.
[203:49.54]No way.
[203:49.88]Imagine there were seven of these.
[203:57.00]Or eight of these.
[204:12.05]I wonder why...
[204:14.37]Yeah, I don't know.
[204:15.79]Weird.
[204:16.17]It seems bizarre that they wouldn't make another one.
[204:21.43]Means the first ones were so good.
[204:26.28]Bizarre, I think.
[204:32.02]Wanted to end this on a high note.
[204:33.65]Oh, fuck.
[204:46.66]Oh no, this TV fell down.
[204:48.01]He can't berate me.
[205:07.70]Ooh, there it is.
[205:09.84]Wait.
[205:14.81]They get out the puzzle in record time.
[205:25.25]You know, this game would have actually been really good if you had to make choices and kill somebody and keep somebody else alive.
[205:43.02]We could have at least made choices.
[205:45.98]Rather than just do another light puzzle to save this guy or he's going to get squished.
[205:58.39]Okay, I need a lever and I need... You suck at making stuff.
[206:14.72]There's a house with a wall with a dad at the bottom of the sea.
[206:18.85]Alright, find the lever.
[206:19.69]Find the acid plating area.
[206:29.23]Is this open?
[206:29.71]None of these are open.
[206:33.49]Lever.
[206:40.50]Build my elevator.
[206:42.84]Well, it's obviously not here.
[206:46.55]Can't go in there shipping and receiving.
[206:48.15]Jigsaw, what the fuck do you want me to do here?
[206:54.45]I watched a door open, did I?
[206:55.73]You sure I wasn't looking away from the video game?
[207:01.10]I might have been looking away from the video game at that moment.
[207:10.00]Alright, let's go.
[207:10.48]Oh, did I accidentally just not die from whatever that was?
[207:15.16]Circuits!
[207:29.74]Oh, it's gotta come from up, doesn't it?
[207:37.16]Sick.
[207:37.52]Okay, now we gotta get yellow.
[207:43.86]Has to be this way.
[207:46.55]Has to be this way.
[207:49.25]Way!
[207:49.97]What'd you do that for?
[207:50.81]What the fuck?
[207:53.59]What just happened?
[208:09.18]Fuck.
[208:13.00]Fuck.
[208:13.30]This is wrong.
[208:14.37]Alright, hold on.
[208:15.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[208:15.77]It has to come from up and down.
[208:22.11]So therefore... It has to go... Like this.
[208:28.29]Or this.
[208:28.67]Has to.
[208:29.38]Has to.
[208:31.45]So we're going to say, fill this, and this over here.
[208:38.69]And then that goes like this.
[208:42.81]And this is wrong again.
[208:43.75]It's wrong again.
[208:44.99]Okay.
[208:56.40]It's wrong again.
[209:01.93]Okay, I did it.
[209:03.35]I did it very, very, very well.
[209:06.43]I don't know how that happened.
[209:16.56]Accidental.
[209:18.72]Alright, find the lever.
[209:34.33]Kanye's in your chat?
[209:36.43]Not a joke.
[209:36.99]Kanye's here.
[209:37.65]What's up?
[209:39.81]What's going on, Kanye?
[209:43.09]What's up?
[209:44.45]You gonna tweet out the screen?
[209:46.03]Imagine Imagine Alright, it's just Kanye holding a picture up that says like a Reddit AMA timestamp on it that says, hi, Jerma.
[210:04.81]Alright, I got you, I got you.
[210:06.18]How do I get it?
[210:06.64]Please, help me!
[210:11.42]What's with the acid?
[210:12.02]Get acid on the chain!
[210:30.09]The color was messed up.
[210:32.14]I thought it was the other one.
[210:33.96]Pink and red, they look kind of similar sometimes.
[210:36.58]The door is stuck.
[210:39.32]Get the acid, dude.
[210:49.42]Melt the chain.
[210:50.98]Just hold on.
[210:54.54]Keep that acid away.
[210:59.58]We're good.
[211:04.71]It's Amanda again.
[211:06.01]Alright.
[211:06.29]How many times am I going to drop my mouse on the ground?
[211:09.35]Alright.
[211:09.67]Don't accidentally turn off the stream or something.
[211:11.63]Dude, come on.
[211:12.55]Alright.
[211:13.61]What's in here?
[211:13.95]Alright.
[211:15.79]There's the valve I need.
[211:18.55]Nothing.
[211:18.77]Okay.
[211:19.05]That's the valve.
[211:21.16]Up here, we've got... There's no timer, so this is fine.
[211:25.08]Get you when I get you.
[211:28.30]Get him.
[211:28.76]I'm getting him.
[211:47.92]There's no danger in this game besides stepping on glass and stuff.
[211:54.07]What?
[211:54.37]What was that?
[211:57.69]Alright, we have a combination lock.
[212:04.94]It's probably one, two, three.
[212:06.42]Hold on, let me scoot closer to you.
[212:17.40]Lockpick.
[212:19.48]McDLT box.
[212:22.24]And that's it.
[212:22.86]Just the lockpick.
[212:23.66]Sure.
[212:31.35]Why did I say that?
[212:31.87]I want one now.
[212:33.45]I'm definitely going to order a McDonald's.
[212:37.03]I'm going to Uber Eats McDonald's.
[212:39.29]Yep.
[212:40.37]Oh, I think so.
[212:48.97]What did that do?
[213:02.58]Yuck.
[213:05.48]You don't yuck McDonald's here.
[213:06.90]Alright, who has the code?
[213:15.81]Guy with the walkthrough that's sitting open and spamming it in the chat right now.
[213:17.99]What is it?
[213:23.27]5, 4, 3.
[213:27.54]Damn it.
[213:27.82]I was hoping that the last security guy just forgot to scramble it when he left.
[213:30.50]Wrong.
[213:35.60]6, 9, 4.
[213:35.72]Nope.
[213:49.45]I'm getting flashbacks.
[213:54.66]The last time I did... No, I'm not doing this again.
[213:56.78]I'm actually getting flashbacks to the last time I played the first game.
[214:02.10]So what did that connect?
[214:03.06]What does that do?
[214:11.83]Oh, I can go in the elevator.
[214:16.39]I can go in the elevator.
[214:34.89]I wonder if there are any celebrities that watch my stream.
[214:37.49]What do you guys think?
[214:42.79]Do you think Brad Pitt's here sometimes?
[214:45.68]He's just a huge fan, but he will never be able to say that out loud.
[214:48.46]He will never say that.
[214:53.16]Brad Pitt's probably under the covers right now with a bright iPhone screen.
[214:59.98]In pajamas.
[215:00.56]Okay, well I need a coupler.
[215:09.81]Time to spam search every box.
[215:21.74]Kick the door.
[215:22.28]Sure.
[215:28.00]What about Chuck E. Cheese?
[215:31.39]Uh, Chuck E. Cheese is not a celebrity.
[215:36.22]He's a toy.
[215:38.38]He's a big toy.
[215:41.30]He's not a celebrity.
[215:42.38]He's a mascot.
[215:43.26]Is a mascot a celebrity?
[215:44.44]Okay, would you say... Okay, would you say the... Like the guy dressed up as the penguin.
[215:54.57]Or like the penguin hockey team.
[215:56.59]Is that a celebrity?
[216:01.83]The guy in the New England Patriots Elvis costume.
[216:04.16]Is that a celebrity?
[216:09.84]Darkness illuminates.
[216:10.86]Well, thanks.
[216:11.62]No, it doesn't.
[216:18.04]Why'd you just tell me that?
[216:35.81]apologize to Mr. Cheese.
[216:38.89]No, he's a great mascot, but he's not... Okay, they don't... Chuck E. Cheese does not go to the red carpet during, like, the Oscars or the Emmys or anything.
[216:50.92]They don't interview Chuck E. Cheese to ask him what he's wearing.
[216:58.99]Oh, Chuck E. Cheese, come over here.
[217:00.45]Let's see what you're wearing today.
[217:03.09]Well, it's, uh...
[217:05.41]It's a shirt for a toddler.
[217:06.99]It says C on it for Chucky, for Charlie.
[217:10.83]And I wear pants, biker shorts that ride way up too high and they're a little too tight.
[217:16.64]I wear this, Joan, I wear this every day.
[217:20.12]Oh, you look marvelous.
[217:25.52]Really hope I get the Emmy.
[217:33.24]This doesn't do anything.
[217:49.80]Nightwing t-shirt and cargo shorts.
[217:52.56]What about it?
[217:56.24]What?
[218:02.61]What is it?
[218:04.39]Best dressed from what I can tell everyone looks stunning tonight on the red carpet.
[218:12.21]Oh shit.
[218:17.19]Oh, that's not good.
[218:21.69]Where is he?
[218:22.71]He's okay.
[218:24.17]He's on the red carpet.
[218:28.99]Alright, but hold on a minute.
[218:30.27]Is this like the Oscars or is this like the Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards?
[218:45.62]This dude's awesome.
[218:48.46]Oh, what a celebrity, huh?
[218:51.04]This dude, when half of your press doesn't even give a shit that you're on the red carpet, he's just guessing where that photo is.
[218:58.70]He doesn't even care.
[219:01.08]He's happier to be on the other guy's camera.
[219:04.52]You bet your ass this guy's gonna put his face right in and focus the fuck out of that camera when Ariana Grande walks by.
[219:13.86]Not for Chuck E. Cheese, apparently.
[219:23.83]This is a staged photo.
[219:25.65]This is in front of a backdrop.
[219:27.73]This is a backdrop.
[219:28.59]This is a backdrop.
[219:30.69]It's not a real car, but it's a backdrop.
[219:39.34]No, it's not real.
[219:40.00]There's a backdrop here.
[219:50.44]Anyways.
[219:53.09]Yeah, okay, sure.
[219:54.25]Have you ever been invited to a red carpet thing?
[219:58.13]No, because the last time I ate as many hors d'oeuvres as I could.
[220:01.83]I was really, really hungry.
[220:04.19]I hadn't eaten all day, and there was somebody walking around with the free shit of food.
[220:08.81]Clams!
[220:09.43]Oh, wow!
[220:09.91]I'll take bacon-wrapped scallops!
[220:11.25]I just ate a ton of them.
[220:13.39]And then after that, I never got invited back to anything else.
[220:15.83]And I know that's why.
[220:16.86]I'm certain that's why.
[220:24.40]That's a boomer joke.
[220:33.04]Yeah, okay, sorry.
[220:34.40]Sorry, I can't make any references to anything.
[220:40.47]Where am I going?
[220:41.15]You guys have never had an hors d'oeuvre before?
[220:53.22]What's the answer?
[220:54.04]I don't care.
[220:54.50]I just, I know it's like to turn the light on in that room, but it didn't work.
[220:57.12]Because I don't have a coupler.
[221:06.32]Oh my god.
[221:07.90]Why can't I just have an infinite coupler?
[221:19.17]Coupler, please.
[221:20.29]This is the bathroom again.
[221:25.97]Have you guys ever been to a wedding?
[221:27.69]You guys never had hors d'oeuvres before?
[221:29.07]I find that hard to believe.
[221:30.03]I feel like by the time you reach the age of... I don't know.
[221:47.38]17?
[221:47.40]15?
[221:47.44]You've probably already been to one or two weddings.
[221:51.79]Here it is.
[221:57.68]Found the image.
[221:59.28]Hey, Jerma.
[221:59.72]520, 102620.
[222:01.40]P.S.
[222:01.94]I love Saw 2.
[222:06.42]He took it at the red carpet.
[222:08.50]I'm not even putting it on stream because I don't even know.
[222:11.50]What's the answer?
[222:16.41]I know somebody has it.
[222:17.29]Please, please let me continue the stream.
[222:19.37]I know somebody has it and don't fuck with me.
[222:26.75]Come on.
[222:27.67]Please.
[222:28.85]Please, please.
[222:29.89]I don't want to go in that room and look for it.
[222:32.07]Oh, what?
[222:32.37]753.
[222:33.25]Come on.
[222:37.46]Come on.
[222:39.12]454.
[222:41.00]Please.
[222:42.40]Please, one of you.
[222:44.00]Do the work.
[222:44.68]No, I'm not doing the work.
[222:47.56]027.
[222:47.62]Come on.
[222:51.10]Help me out here.
[222:52.90]Help me out.
[222:55.03]Do the work.
[222:55.51]No, I'm not doing the work.
[222:57.19]Do the fucking work.
[222:57.91]I'm not doing the work.
[223:02.38]It's not 6-2-1.
[223:06.12]No, it's not.
[223:08.44]Please.
[223:08.68]2-3-4.
[223:08.74]1-2-6.
[223:09.20]1-2-6.
[223:22.73]Come on.
[223:23.93]I don't want to do this.
[223:25.47]I've tried.
[223:26.15]I can't even figure out what am I supposed to do?
[223:31.91]Darkness illuminates.
[223:34.59]Oh, well, let's take a look.
[223:37.68]Sure is dark in here.
[223:43.16]Turn the light on.
[223:45.22]Well, I think I'll turn on the light for a little bit if I could.
[223:50.90]Oh, Juggles the clown.
[223:55.82]Goku.
[224:05.21]Dark, this illuminates.
[224:09.37]Oh, happy Halloween, everyone.
[224:11.95]Happy Halloween, Goku.
[224:17.43]Do you see?
[224:18.01]I don't see anything behind you.
[224:19.15]There's nothing here.
[224:23.17]I'm spinning in a circle.
[224:28.87]In the toilet, darkness illuminates, but there's... Inside the toilet, there's something.
[224:38.19]Toilet!
[224:40.11]Couple of... Just a couple of humans.
[224:45.66]Um, get it?
[224:46.14]Grab?
[224:47.14]What does that have to do with darkness illuminates?
[225:06.87]Turn on the lights.
[225:08.44]I can't do that.
[225:11.22]Can't do that, Goku.
[225:16.20]Alright, now let's go back to this stupid thing, wherever it is.
[225:20.18]Plug in the coupler, do the lightning thing.
[225:27.25]It's not 620.
[225:27.89]It's 621.
[225:28.11]Everyone wants me to write that.
[225:40.74]Where's this room with the coupler in it?
[225:47.55]Where the hell is this room?
[226:08.86]That year it was 620.
[226:14.86]Thanks a lot.
[226:19.04]Apologize.
[226:19.82]I am sorry.
[226:21.06]I'm very sorry.
[226:25.18]Please accept my apology.
[226:26.24]I took a man to a graveyard.
[226:40.87]All of this way.
[226:41.73]No, no, no, no, no.
[226:46.21]Work less.
[226:47.35]I did it, right?
[226:51.17]That's free.
[226:53.21]I did it.
[226:54.11]I've been.
[226:54.75]Huh?
[227:18.25]Uh, who the fuck are you?
[227:21.03]Where did he come from?
[227:22.61]Defend?
[227:23.83]If you could please- I'm hitting square, I promise.
[227:35.06]Grandpa Scream?
[227:35.80]Yeah, what was with the Grandpa Scream?
[227:37.34]This guy looks like he's in his 20s.
[227:41.48]You little bastard!
[227:57.94]Hmm... Okay.
[228:07.08]We did it.
[228:08.87]We can leave.
[228:09.57]Away.
[228:12.89]What did I do?
[228:21.09]I feel like I just came down here and walked around in a circle.
[228:24.12]What did I do?
[228:30.75]Holy shit.
[228:31.63]OK, that was that was a head shotgun.
[228:34.51]It's the first head shotgun of the game.
[228:37.53]It made this one so much easier because it's going to be a quick time for every single one.
[228:40.89]OK, we've got.
[228:57.00]One is we got hand.
[229:00.07]Hand, knife, skull, snake.
[229:04.07]Hand, knife, skull, snake.
[229:05.81]Hand, knife, skull, snake.
[229:07.95]Hand, knife, skull, snake.
[229:11.67]Hand, knife, skull, snake.
[229:20.74]Uh, sure.
[229:22.62]Nice game.
[229:23.88]Nice liar game.
[229:36.94]It was too slow.
[229:37.70]I was not too slow.
[229:38.71]I was right on top of that.
[229:39.79]It's a really roundabout way to get whatever this is.
[229:50.36]A puzzle piece.
[229:52.62]That's not what I wanted.
[229:53.62]I wanted a lever or a stake or a wheel or something.
[229:57.26]Not this shit.
[230:11.00]Let's go.
[230:13.62]Obama's in the chat.
[230:19.35]He's under the covers.
[230:20.27]In his pajamas.
[230:23.15]Okay.
[230:39.65]I did it.
[230:40.27]Let's release you from that.
[230:42.63]Wait.
[230:48.51]Stop.
[230:52.05]He shot me.
[230:52.65]I got shot by that gun.
[230:58.37]Someone explain to me why this guy is doing this again.
[231:00.33]Wasn't this the guy with the gun in his mouth?
[231:13.06]Where is he?
[231:18.45]Ow!
[231:19.65]This is a mini game too.
[231:20.77]This is gonna be fun.
[231:21.53]You know, he can't come over here and shoot me in the back of the head, right?
[231:28.09]Okay, that was very, very easy.
[231:31.55]Hmm...
[231:48.41]Please chat.
[231:52.47]Just tell me where his weak point is.
[231:55.05]It's not his chest.
[231:55.88]I shot him in the chest twice.
[231:57.20]It's not his arm because he has a thing on his arm.
[231:59.96]It's not his head.
[232:00.66]Fucking please help me.
[232:03.12]Somebody do it for me.
[232:04.30]Somebody look it up for me.
[232:15.83]Fucking reload.
[232:16.61]Where do I go?
[232:20.56]God damn it.
[232:22.98]Right there.
[232:32.40]Go through the door.
[232:33.70]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[232:49.03]Graham is in the chat.
[232:51.24]We get raided by Jermo?
[232:56.20]That's cool.
[233:02.98]What's up?
[233:04.62]What's up, everybody?
[233:07.44]Show me the emotes.
[233:08.49]What's going on, guys?
[233:11.93]Big raid.
[233:12.37]This is a big one.
[233:21.09]That's a shitload of people.
[233:23.11]What's up, man?
[233:24.31]Hope you had a good stream.
[233:25.85]What was Jerma doing today?
[233:33.87]Are you serious?
[233:34.53]He's playing Saw 2.
[233:35.87]I saw him play the first one.
[233:37.21]That game sucks, huh?
[233:40.51]I feel bad for him.
[233:41.47]It's really hard to keep up with that.
[233:47.77]We don't play on this channel.
[233:49.06]Like, it's far too difficult to, like, be able to play a game that's old and terrible.
[233:54.14]And, like, you know, talk to chat and everything.
[233:56.06]Like, I wouldn't do that here.
[233:58.04]Props to him, though.
[233:58.86]Like, props to him.
[234:01.30]Like, mad props.
[234:09.78]Sing the raid song.
[234:10.90]Oh, of course.
[234:11.46]What, am I crazy?
[234:12.38]Thank you!
[234:31.32]Wait.
[234:33.70]Acid corrodes metal as well as flesh.
[234:43.08]That was very... That's it?
[234:51.01]Thanks, man.
[234:52.61]He's gonna get dunked in the acid.
[235:00.98]Why don't you leave?
[235:16.05]I would get out of here.
[235:19.19]I'd get out of here.
[235:21.27]Okay, use the key to enter the lackier studio.
[235:30.51]Go up.
[235:35.73]Go up.
[235:37.69]What's in his cell?
[235:38.69]Anything interesting?
[235:40.29]Yup.
[235:41.17]Oh, okay.
[235:59.18]Wait, the dude over there that's throwing acid on people?
[236:02.23]I think we're saving people in strange manners here.
[236:20.76]Hello, Michael.
[236:26.56]Remember that time that you burnt that entire village with all these old ladies in every house?
[236:35.07]You can thank Detective Tapp for saving you.
[236:51.13]Did they just do like a secret handshake?
[237:01.57]Did you see that?
[237:02.01]You're gonna get your head smashed in.
[237:07.65]You're gonna get your head smashed in.
[237:11.01]Guarantee her head smashed in over there when we go over there.
[237:22.66]Slime raid, slime raid.
[237:26.92]Slimers, what's up?
[237:29.84]Welcome.
[237:31.34]Slimers.
[237:34.09]Slimers, put your hands up.
[237:37.83]Stand up.
[237:42.73]Unenthusiastic raid.
[237:43.92]Alright, the next time I get raided, I'm going to do a very unenthusiastic raid acceptance speech.
[237:52.69]What's up?
[237:54.45]How's everybody doing?
[237:57.66]No fucking way, dude.
[238:00.38]What's up?
[238:08.44]Alright, just don't touch the bombs.
[238:18.18]Raid.
[238:22.71]Have you ever eaten a corn dog?
[238:24.13]Yes, I've eaten a corn dog.
[238:29.11]Why does that matter, by the way?
[238:30.45]Well, who cares if I've ever had a corn dog?
[238:36.55]Does your opinion of me change if I love corn dogs or something?
[238:41.94]Okay, what if I have one and I don't like it?
[238:44.68]It does change, okay.
[238:45.44]Whoa.
[238:51.36]Whoa.
[238:58.51]You're trash.
[239:00.33]Trash?
[239:02.17]Wait, I like corndogs.
[239:03.03]I didn't say I didn't like corndogs.
[239:04.13]Alright, if human flesh touches it, does it explode?
[239:16.80]I'm assuming yes.
[239:27.64]Um...
[239:28.76]Okay.
[239:29.70]Don't go in here.
[239:30.64]Don't go in this one.
[239:32.18]Don't go in that room.
[239:37.92]Alright.
[239:46.33]Can I open this?
[239:49.05]I think I have to go in there.
[239:50.65]What else am I going to do?
[239:51.25]Go up, maybe?
[239:55.49]You have to.
[239:59.69]Guess I have to.
[240:00.29]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[240:22.11]Turn it off.
[240:22.55]Turn off the gas.
[240:25.83]Where do I turn the gas off?
[240:28.17]Burn off the gas!
[240:29.21]That didn't do anything.
[240:44.86]Big if true.
[240:50.79]Barack Obama tweets.
[240:52.85]Wow.
[240:54.04]I can't believe Jerma is playing my favorite game, Steam Fortress 2.
[241:00.40]It would suck if he ever played something like Saw 2 in seven years.
[241:04.83]I can't go in there yet.
[241:19.18]What do I do?
[241:25.06]What do I do?
[241:33.43]Go in there, keep to the left, and go clockwise.
[241:36.57]Well, I need... I need... Refresh.
[241:54.37]It would suck if we played something like Saw 2 in seven years.
[242:00.37]When's Otto's Big Adventure 3?
[242:01.89]That's not going to happen ever.
[242:04.68]Maybe.
[242:16.73]Jump down?
[242:18.09]Oh my goodness.
[242:28.10]What do I do?
[242:28.38]What do I do?
[242:28.68]What do I do?
[242:29.08]What do I do?
[242:30.91]Hurry!
[242:32.81]Help!
[242:41.44]Fucking hurry.
[242:42.34]I'm hurrying.
[242:44.26]I'm out!
[242:59.25]Go faster.
[243:00.41]I actually didn't, I didn't even pick up the, um, the syringe at the beginning.
[243:05.91]That's my mistake.
[243:06.58]I'm sorry.
[243:11.34]CBT.
[243:14.80]Alright, relax.
[243:31.82]So VR tomorrow, you're gonna see some fucking wild stuff.
[243:37.85]I got the Walking Dead video game.
[243:39.51]I've got a bunch of scary shit.
[243:44.02]No, end of stream.
[243:44.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[243:47.04]I'm just saying.
[244:01.56]You gonna beat this game tonight?
[244:06.05]I would say the likelihood of me completing this game is zero.
[244:12.89]So, this is the only time you're ever going to see me play this game.
[244:19.56]Ever.
[244:20.86]I ain't ever.
[244:21.78]This is it.
[244:22.44]I'm playing until I'm done, and then I'm done, and it's going into a box.
[244:26.36]Wait, hold on.
[244:31.65]What's the point of going in here?
[244:36.53]Zerking off in VR.
[244:39.43]Well, not that.
[244:49.66]Where do I... Up.
[245:01.07]There's no way I'm near the end of the game.
[245:02.35]Guys, the last game was like seven hours.
[245:06.03]You don't think this one's going to be at least six or seven hours?
[245:18.55]Go, go, go, go, go.
[245:28.79]Give me a fucking break.
[245:34.86]Why is this in the game?
[245:36.68]Why is this in the game?
[245:49.55]Okay.
[245:49.89]Am I dead?
[246:00.47]Another audio tape.
[246:02.88]I'm not even happy with the audio tape, guys.
[246:04.40]There's no way we're happy with the game.
[246:05.90]I was going to say, I didn't feel that.
[246:13.24]Alright, what's a good McDonald's order?
[246:21.78]What's a good McDonald's order?
[246:22.96]I'm talking your favorite.
[246:27.00]Best McDonald's order gets ordered.
[246:29.58]And I promise I'll eat it off stream.
[246:43.22]Medium fry.
[246:43.80]Nope.
[246:45.28]I mean, large fry.
[246:46.71]Always.
[246:47.03]McDonald's cheesesteak.
[246:52.59]Hey, you know what?
[246:53.19]I actually... Wendy's has this new hamburger.
[246:56.63]What the hell was it?
[246:57.19]It's a... It's a new cheeseburger.
[247:01.31]I saw it and I was like, holy shit, it looks really good.
[247:02.77]What is it?
[247:07.18]The Wendy's thing.
[247:08.16]It's a pretzel thing.
[247:09.20]It's a pretzel bun, pretzel pub burger.
[247:11.20]Yeah.
[247:11.58]Yeah.
[247:13.36]Anybody had that yet?
[247:14.70]That sounds really good.
[247:17.76]It's a pretzel bun with pub cheese on it.
[247:22.66]It's pretty good.
[247:23.14]Might have to change my order here.
[247:25.44]Might have to order some Wendy's Uber Eats.
[247:34.10]The sauce is kind of bad.
[247:35.58]Oh, that's unfortunate, is it?
[247:43.46]Happy meal it's not weird that it would take five or six happy meals before I was happy, right Okay Your dad
[248:16.09]It's not good.
[248:17.61]It's really not good.
[248:20.63]No, why am I even doing this?
[248:22.05]Why waste a lockpick on this?
[248:24.41]It's a pipe.
[248:29.24]That's the kind of insult that the person uses because they know that it's going to piss you off.
[248:36.98]It's not even about you.
[248:37.98]It's about making you angry.
[248:42.67]That is about you.
[248:45.66]Hey, your dad sucks.
[248:46.60]He's like, you don't fucking know my dad.
[248:49.04]Shut up.
[248:50.46]Yeah, your dad sucks.
[248:56.16]Yeah, I saw your mom at the grocery store.
[248:58.49]Hey, I'm Mrs. Elbertson.
[249:00.35]I'm here as mom.
[249:01.47]You know, that's not what she talks like.
[249:04.31]Fuck you, buddy.
[249:06.47]And then, get off me.
[249:08.23]Stop touching, don't touch my face.
[249:09.31]Stop touching my face.
[249:10.79]And then you both go to detention.
[249:30.52]Is this personal experience?
[249:37.42]This happened last week.
[249:38.72]In my schoolyard.
[249:45.25]If you want to talk about a PogChamp moment, I'll give you one right there.
[249:57.87]Anything but codes.
[250:00.92]have to be four digit painted on the wall codes.
[250:30.90]That was easy.

[250:34.66]You would have done it twice.
[250:35.52]How did he get back here?
[250:46.65]Isn't that kind of an odd spot to be sitting?
[250:52.45]I don't know.
[250:55.41]That's weird.
[251:04.18]New game mechanic.
[251:07.52]I'm actually glad to see a new mechanic.
[251:10.40]Don't touch the poison.
[251:14.04]I didn't.

[252:06.82]It did?
[252:09.49]No, it didn't.

[252:43.31]Alright, so now you get a guaranteed hit every time.

[254:31.51]It's sealed.
[254:32.25]Does he have to break this?
[254:33.17]Don't even tell me he has to break this.

[255:31.45]Alright, I got him.
[255:46.27]I trapped him.
[255:48.53]What does that do for me?

[263:51.94]I didn't even hear it.
[263:55.31]Go empty your bladder.
[263:56.05]Calm down.
[263:57.47]I'm fine.

[264:46.21]That was the guy we let out in the very beginning.
[264:47.59]It's this guy.
[264:49.43]Instead, you squeeze them for every penny, forcing them to work for you.
[265:06.86]We'll close one by one.
[265:08.46]So we have to... What do we have to do?
[265:11.66]Who do you take... What do you take advantage of?

[267:17.37]What are we missing?
[267:18.55]This one down here.
[267:19.31]Alright, come up and tell me.
[267:23.32]Give me a big hug.
[267:26.82]Fuck, man.
[267:28.16]I didn't think you'd spring me, huh?
[267:30.54]What did we ever do to deserve this, right?
[267:33.34]You know what you did.
[267:35.56]What we did.
[267:37.18]Yeah, well, you gotta make a living.
[267:39.99]What, do you think you're some sort of hero going around rescuing everybody?
[267:43.25]Please, do me a favor and stay out of my way.
[267:47.01]I don't care about myself.
[267:48.65]Not anymore.
[267:50.03]When you get out of this cell, I'm putting you in another prison.
[267:53.68]Fuck you.
[267:54.34]I'm not going to prison.
[268:02.52]Well, you know what?
[268:03.62]I guess we probably... Let's take a break.
[268:06.96]I'll take a break.
[268:08.88]I will be right back.
[268:10.06]Give me two seconds.
[268:11.95]Just get up.
[268:12.47]I'll be right back.
[268:17.89]I'll take care of that later.
[268:49.03]That sucks.
[268:53.81]I just grabbed my keyboard like holding WASD like the fuck are you doing dude?
[268:59.56]Hey, I'm back.
[269:01.58]It's a good break.
[269:13.97]No!
[269:25.94]I didn't skip that.
[269:26.56]Oh, snooze.
[269:28.72]What a snooze.
[269:29.67]Oh, my God.
[269:30.11]What?
[269:31.21]That's a snooze.
[269:32.57]Oh, power the elevator again.
[269:33.61]Even this motherfucker sounds so sick of this.
[269:57.55]What you need to do is you need to power the third elevator.
[270:02.11]And when you get up there, you're going to find a person that's a stranger.
[270:09.46]There'll be a stranger up there.
[270:14.56]That's tied to a device.
[270:15.86]You'll have to maybe get them out of it.
[270:21.27]There's a puzzle that's there.
[270:25.51]Okay, see you later.
[270:27.27]Enjoy.
[270:30.15]Punk!
[270:39.96]Key to the elevator!
[270:41.10]Every time I've popped into the stream the last few hours, you've said snooze.
[270:51.72]I think that's the first time I've said snooze in four and a half hours, man.
[270:55.77]I don't think that's accurate.
[271:19.65]it's so bizarre because the animations are in the game there's a swing animation there is a you hit me animation so why make the whole thing qte last game had combat that wasn't qte you're not adding anything you're just taking away my ability to interact with the game
[271:50.79]Jerma says, this game sucks.
[271:51.93]I hate it.
[271:52.35]Boring.
[271:52.71]Oh my god.
[271:54.15]Chat, so play something else.
[271:55.75]Wait, what does that say?
[271:56.97]I want to read that.
[271:59.37]This game sucks.
[272:00.03]I hate it.
[272:00.47]It's so boring.
[272:01.17]Oh my god.
[272:02.07]So play something else.
[272:03.37]Chat, the game is not that bad.
[272:04.47]Calm down.
[272:06.37]You're accurate.
[272:07.53]No.
[272:07.99]No, no, no.
[272:08.33]Hold on.
[272:09.13]That's not accurate.
[272:10.55]I'm having fun playing the game.
[272:12.09]I'm not having fun playing the game.
[272:13.82]You know what I mean?
[272:15.56]I'm having fun playing the game and hanging out.
[272:18.04]I'm not having fun playing the video game.
[272:22.47]I'm having fun playing the game here.
[272:24.71]Not the video game.
[272:25.43]There you go.
[272:38.48]It's a fun experience, but not a fun interaction.
[272:40.22]Thank you for literally saying the thing I wanted to say.
[272:53.54]Turn the cam on.
[273:04.13]Good thing I wasn't naked.
[273:11.55]Do I have a greasy face?
[273:12.61]I don't.
[273:21.03]Greasy face?
[273:29.83]Run a green screen to cover your nakedness.
[273:31.57]I don't have a... No.
[273:37.92]Come back.
[273:39.84]No.
[273:41.42]You don't want me here.
[273:42.48]You don't want me here.
[273:47.90]Come back, please.
[273:58.85]Turn back on, please.
[273:59.93]I will.
[274:00.52]At some point before the stream ends, I will.
[274:02.54]I promise.
[274:02.90]Hmm, really look bad here.
[274:12.70]That's a bad feed.
[274:14.50]He was about to tell me something.
[274:20.46]Um, so what did that really do for us?
[274:21.62]I moved that.
[274:29.22]Like, who fucking cares?
[274:48.72]Alright, what's the scariest VR game that's come out that I haven't played?
[274:52.68]I played Dreadhalls.
[274:53.46]I think that one's probably number one.
[275:05.37]Alright, let me in.
[275:13.66]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[275:18.30]Easy listening?
[275:19.32]What?
[275:23.50]Oh, I can't wait for fucking Wendy's and McDonald's.
[275:25.64]You know, sometimes just love it.
[275:38.46]You're loving it.
[275:39.18]I'm loving it.
[275:41.44]Yeah.
[275:43.44]That's true.
[275:43.90]Oh, push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, push it.
[275:52.91]Did I pull this or... You're normalizing being unhealthy.
[276:10.27]Uh, I didn't say eat McDonald's every day.
[276:13.45]You know, it didn't go, ba-da-ba-ba-ba, eat McDonald's every day.
[276:21.32]It's not the jingle.
[276:24.66]It's because I love it, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat it every day.
[276:26.58]That'd be kind of funny ad campaign, though.
[276:46.78]He's trying to kill us.
[276:47.72]He's not trying to kill anybody.
[276:50.08]Now what?
[277:01.12]Is this product placement?
[277:03.38]Not really.
[277:03.88]Oh, I can move this all the way.
[277:08.94]Product placement would be if the cam was on and there was a... It was like a McDonald's wrapper.
[277:15.92]Just on the shelf behind me.
[277:18.00]The whole time.
[277:18.48]Alright, we'll have to go around again.
[277:30.79]Why can I not push this?
[277:34.89]I can pull it, but I can't push it.
[277:35.93]Why?
[277:37.01]Why?
[277:40.97]That's as far as it goes.
[277:42.01]That's dumb.
[277:57.91]Come on.
[277:59.00]Come on.
[278:07.42]Happy?
[278:09.16]Come on.
[278:16.29]Alright, now we have to leave.
[278:17.25]Alright, my head's gonna explode.
[278:25.02]Hold on.
[278:25.26]Why is this place on fire?
[278:47.18]Cam off!
[278:53.20]Why can I not move this shit?
[278:59.95]I can't move.
[279:00.73]Are you kidding me?
[279:08.54]This is stupid.
[279:27.45]Okay.
[279:31.23]Turn it on and I'll lose the shirt.
[279:33.99]Wrong website.
[279:42.95]Cursed link.
[279:43.77]I don't know what it is.
[279:46.07]What is it?
[279:50.43]Did that do it?
[279:50.97]Can I push it?
[279:53.49]It's really cursed.
[279:54.71]Well, now I need to know.
[279:59.78]That's not even me.
[280:04.92]That's not me.
[280:25.16]No, it's not.
[280:29.53]It's not me.
[280:39.88]Hey, you fucked with my mouth or something.
[280:46.60]Yeah, you like fucked with my face.
[280:57.89]yes let's go ahead and sneak by uh have I hit more than three people with an axe in the whole five hours I've been playing I haven't right
[281:26.24]There's melee weapons everywhere.
[281:28.67]For no reason.
[281:32.31]There's not a single solitary reason to have melee weapons in the game.
[281:37.23]It just looks cool to hold, I guess.
[281:38.47]Alright, so that turned off the fire.
[281:49.32]But who really gives a shit?
[281:56.85]What's this?
[281:57.76]It's a better Link.
[282:04.98]Oh, I don't know if I'd call it better.
[282:14.69]I'd say it's a little more of the, uh... Wait, someone's talking.
[282:26.85]Who's talking?
[282:32.50]Where is this guy?
[282:33.42]Did we miss something important?
[282:39.40]That something cool happened?
[283:07.35]You burnt Barry, you know we want to say he was obsessed with fire 45 minutes sexy to get that elevator moving
[283:31.40]Open it.
[283:33.02]At least, at the very least, it's not timed.
[283:41.48]We all know how much we love that shit.
[283:53.71]Okay.
[283:59.51]How am I gonna get this?
[284:03.63]Can't even get that one.
[284:06.73]Have to be a split.
[284:07.43]Okay.
[284:19.03]Okay.
[284:32.32]Wrong.
[284:46.80]I hate this shit.
[284:48.84]Then don't play it.
[284:49.77]I... Yeah, I know you're right.
[284:52.79]I know you're right.
[284:54.77]300 people left?
[284:56.27]Well... They probably had... They probably... We talked about McDonald's.
[284:59.39]They probably gave them McDonald's.
[285:12.79]A thousand left.
[285:13.83]A thousand left.
[285:16.16]That's a lot.
[285:17.06]That's a major viewer crash.
[285:22.06]Why is this not going?
[285:39.53]Fuck.
[285:43.89]Why?
[285:46.45]There's only two things coming out of these ones.
[285:50.03]What the fuck?
[286:15.51]You can turn the battery.
[286:17.81]Oh my God.
[286:19.07]Why did I not even?
[286:20.01]Why?
[286:21.73]That saves me so much pain.
[286:23.60]Get out of the way.
[286:41.45]Get out of my way.
[286:44.15]Get out of my way.
[286:48.72]Get out of the way.
[286:55.10]Don't.
[287:01.96]Oh, my God.
[287:02.44]Dude, Burger King.
[287:03.84]Oh, Burger King is here.
[287:05.81]No way.
[287:07.51]Burger King sucks.
[287:08.83]It is the worst of the three fast food restaurants.
[287:11.33]If you have a choice, fuck Burger King.
[287:14.35]Go to Wendy's and McDonald's first.
[287:16.01]Every time.
[287:18.34]How's that for an ad?
[287:27.05]Except... They're all... Their chicken nuggets and their fries are the best.
[287:32.65]And I like the way their burger tastes.
[287:34.46]This single just cheeseburger, it's got like a flame broiled flavor to it, but fuck you.
[287:55.17]Did I already open this?
[288:00.45]Fries suck.
[288:02.39]No, that's not even real.
[288:03.63]You know it's not real.
[288:04.84]The Burger King fries are actually pretty good.
[288:09.66]What did I just turn on?
[288:10.46]Sorry, we're talking about food.
[288:19.17]They're the worst?
[288:20.75]I think I...
[288:24.16]You know, okay, the Whopper is actually a decent item.
[288:36.73]It's alright.
[288:39.09]No, this one, you know, Burger King does have one really, really good thing over everybody else.
[288:43.55]Kind of a weird thing to say, but you'll know what I'm talking about if you know.
[288:48.02]Uh, they have the best lettuce.
[288:54.33]I didn't die.
[288:54.95]It didn't blow up my head.
[288:55.82]Burger King has the best lettuce on their burgers.
[289:02.20]It's crispy and crunchy and watery and like... It's the only fast food place of the big three that goes... The lettuce.
[289:15.51]What about the foot lettuce?
[289:17.79]That one guy somewhere in the middle, wherever they were...
[289:30.73]Yeah, just because one gross person did something gross at a restaurant.
[290:04.60]What's the number 15?
[290:05.40]Does Bird King have a secret menu?
[290:09.77]That sounds like a secret menu item.
[290:19.88]Here comes some coughing.
[290:24.08]Anyone there?
[290:33.13]Hello?
[290:33.83]Oh, it's, uh, it's Tank Girl.
[290:56.34]Alright, now you turn off your steam.
[290:59.02]Fuck you, Jerma.
[290:59.88]I'm not going to put that on stream because it's fake.
[291:02.36]I'm not going to.
[291:03.16]No.
[291:03.56]I'm not putting it on stream.
[291:08.69]You can have your little fantasy.
[291:09.77]I'm not putting that on stream.
[291:21.15]Oh, shit.
[291:21.65]I burnt her.
[291:24.33]What?
[291:27.82]It burns!
[291:29.12]Ooh, that didn't like it.
[291:31.95]The game didn't like it.
[291:37.88]Uh, what does that mean?
[291:42.50]One omega LOL, eight omega LOL, right?
[291:51.22]Except this is a PlayStation 3.
[291:53.04]Oh, I have to ask a question.
[291:55.28]Um... So, when I turned the PlayStation 3 on, and for a while after I turned it on, I smelled plastic.
[292:02.42]A hot, burning plastic.
[292:04.99]Coming out of the vent in the back.
[292:07.17]What does that mean?
[292:07.75]It's flat.
[292:09.43]That's normal.
[292:22.83]Your PS3 is going through puberty.
[292:27.15]Oh.
[292:34.40]It's not that one, so which one is it?
[292:37.00]Town?
[292:46.19]That was like Burger King.
[292:56.59]Okay, this might sound gross, but it's kind of the reason why I don't hate Burger King.
[293:01.30]Um, you guys ever use a grill, and after you're done cooking the hamburgers on the grill, two to three hours later, the smell that comes from that dirty grill, you know what I'm saying?
[293:14.51]Like, it's got, like, meat and grease all over it, and cheese on the bottom and shit, and
[293:21.53]And it has that, that old, j-grilled smell.
[293:26.73]With food.
[293:27.57]You know, somebody knows what I mean.
[293:29.08]That's what Burger King food smells like.
[293:31.14]It does.
[293:34.26]But it smells kind of good.
[293:40.82]Clean the grill.
[293:41.54]No, I'm talking about the grill is clean.
[293:43.46]I'm talking after you use the grill.
[293:47.91]Like an hour later, the smell that the grill has.
[293:52.72]Of course I cleaned the grill, but you gotta wait till the coals cool off.
[293:54.98]You know what?
[293:55.30]You don't clean it immediately.
[293:56.75]What, you guys got propane?
[293:58.75]Dorks.
[294:10.00]I'm kidding.
[294:14.40]Guys, come on.
[294:15.94]Really?
[294:17.30]Really?
[294:17.58]That's where you're going to end your viewership?
[294:19.26]Is there?
[294:20.50]I called you a dork because you use a propane grill?
[294:23.20]It's been 10 years.
[294:25.12]That's the one you're going out on?
[294:26.20]I'm just kidding.
[294:41.71]Charcoal tastes better though.
[294:43.61]It does.
[294:46.65]How do I get the fuck down there?
[294:52.44]I think charcoal tastes better.
[294:53.30]I'll give you the pros and cons.
[294:58.18]Charcoal is a huge pain in the ass.
[295:01.48]It's not worth it.
[295:03.24]At all.
[295:03.46]It takes so long to get ready.
[295:08.28]It takes so much time and effort.
[295:11.55]The cleanup is fucking horrible.
[295:15.11]But...
[295:18.04]I think it tastes better than propane.
[295:31.21]Am I wrong?
[295:31.79]I don't think so.
[295:33.17]I think I'm kinda wrong.
[295:39.62]Oh, some of these are fake.
[295:51.29]Uh, wait, what?
[295:58.72]Uh, what?
[296:03.97]I have to do them one at a time?
[296:04.83]I think I have to do it one at a time.
[296:18.56]Alright, now red.
[296:20.18]Wait.
[296:20.98]Are you gonna do it?
[296:25.87]Okay, cool.
[296:26.27]Let's do red.
[296:36.55]Earn it.
[296:42.26]Did she kill me?
[296:50.18]What did she do?
[296:50.66]That wasn't correct.
[296:56.42]It was green.
[297:08.73]Choose wisely.
[297:11.45]Wait.
[297:13.15]Wait, did I already do it?
[297:16.71]You only need to do blue.
[297:20.17]Oh.
[297:24.68]Oh, yep, that's another thing.
[297:25.48]Somebody said it.
[297:26.08]Another reason why I hate propane.
[297:28.08]It's a little tube that has so much shit under pressure, the thing can explode.
[297:34.50]I don't like it.
[297:35.02]It's got gas in there.
[297:36.13]You know how much I hate gas.
[297:39.93]I'd rather have rocks that get really hot than just gas stuffed in a little container.
[297:46.01]Where does it all go?
[297:46.55]How does it fit in there?
[297:47.63]How does it not just blow the fuck up?
[297:50.73]I, no.
[297:52.01]Nope, nope, nope.
[298:00.05]It's safe?
[298:00.55]It doesn't matter.
[298:01.03]I'd rather have hot rocks.
[298:14.12]It's the meat, not the heat.
[298:19.29]I like the way that wood charcoal, I think it adds a lot.
[298:32.26]Taste the meat.
[298:35.56]No.
[298:36.84]Put it on there until it's black.
[298:48.34]And then... Crunch it with your back teeth to try to chew through it.
[299:01.68]You guys ever cook food for anybody?
[299:03.02]You guys ever man the grill?
[299:07.70]And you know that you're just like, oh my god, please, for the love of all that is sacred, let me cook this shit right.
[299:14.64]Six people here right now.
[299:16.64]There's five people here, four people here.
[299:19.92]I need, this has to be good.
[299:22.58]So you cook, and you, yeah, I know what I'm doing!
[299:27.39]You need help out there?
[299:28.71]No, I'm good, I'm good!
[299:31.62]Hey, what do you like?
[299:32.36]Medium?
[299:33.02]Oh, yeah.
[299:33.44]Medium well?
[299:34.08]Medium rare?
[299:35.68]I don't know how to do any of those.
[299:37.46]But I'm going to say yeah.
[299:38.48]I'm going to try as hard as I can to make you not throw up.
[299:43.07]I'll take medium rare.
[299:44.11]Oh, I don't know what the fuck that means.
[299:46.15]They're all going to get cooked until black in the middle.
[299:50.55]And then when you finally take the shit off the grill, and you go, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[299:56.41]Don't tell everybody the food's ready yet.
[300:00.22]You take a bite out of a hamburger.
[300:01.35]You make your own hamburger first.
[300:03.21]Everyone's still talking and hanging out.
[300:04.69]Okay, you bite in.
[300:05.93]Is it purple in the middle?
[300:09.27]And if it is... It's not burning yet!
[300:12.75]Just put it on there!
[300:13.83]You put them all back on.
[300:17.48]Oh, the worst part is when somebody else comes over and they want their food.
[300:22.98]They want to do whatever it takes.
[300:27.06]You bite yours.
[300:28.42]Bright fucking red in the middle.
[300:29.66]They don't want that.
[300:31.32]Oh man, he's the grill master.
[300:32.99]There he is.
[300:33.39]Jeremy the grill master.
[300:34.35]Let me take a bite of my hamburger.
[300:40.05]Pretty good.
[300:44.61]Hey, yeah.
[300:46.71]Look at this guy with the grill.
[300:48.97]There he is.
[300:50.28]What you don't know is that person over the course of the next 30 minutes is going to take a bite
[300:57.01]chew it, walk into your bathroom, spit it into your toilet, flush it, come out, spit it in, maybe put it in their hand, put it in their pocket and shit, and they're going to spit it into the toilet like five times.
[301:08.10]That person is going to spit that food over four or five bathroom trips.
[301:13.42]So they don't want you to think that the food was bad. ...
[301:32.97]It's true.
[301:37.27]Have you done this?
[301:38.82]Yes.
[301:41.62]Not into the toilet, though.
[301:47.90]You just go to the bathroom.
[301:50.46]You chew it up.
[301:53.48]Dude, I got... Okay, somebody gave me a raw steak one time.
[302:01.21]I was like, what the fuck am I going to do about this?
[302:09.19]So I took the steak, I opened up my underwear, dropped it in my underwear and closed it.
[302:17.82]And then I grabbed both my hands on my belly and went, mmm, yummy.
[302:35.03]Can I please have the key?
[302:42.55]No, I'm fucking kidding.
[302:45.02]What's the objective?
[302:47.08]Look at the warehouse.
[302:58.75]What was the point of what I was just doing?
[303:03.24]Can't use this to save clips.
[303:05.12]Oh, we need to talk about that for a second, don't we?
[303:09.66]So, apparently there's like a bunch... There's like a Twitch DMCA apocalypse upon us.
[303:14.73]Right?
[303:19.87]I just want to make sure everyone knows this.
[303:23.55]I'm not deleting anything.
[303:25.85]I don't save VODs on Twitch anyways.
[303:27.68]And clips... If you want me to delete every single clip I've ever had on this channel...
[303:33.68]That's hundreds of thousands of memories that will never be recovered.
[303:42.26]I'm not taking them down.
[303:45.71]If it comes down to it and there's a tool I can use or if there's something I can do about it, we cannot be expected to just go delete five plus years worth of shit.
[304:01.48]I mean, if I have a copyright now, alright, then delete it.
[304:05.62]I'm not gonna... That's too stressful for me.
[304:08.38]I'm not gonna do that.
[304:20.78]Yeah, if I delete all clips, I might catch a few copyright ones, but then the slap disappears forever.
[304:27.63]I'm not okay with that.
[304:28.97]Why would I be okay with that?
[304:41.93]No idea where the fuck I'm going.
[304:49.86]I promise I never listen to music ever.
[304:54.20]I don't care about music.
[304:55.76]I don't think about music.
[304:56.87]I never listen to music ever, ever.
[304:58.29]I don't care.
[304:59.31]I don't listen to it.
[305:04.73]I promise I only listen to music in a dark room with a bright light on my face.
[305:11.68]And I make sure that no one's around.
[305:12.95]I open up all my windows and look if there's any neighbors around.
[305:15.57]And I put it on the lowest volume and I sink down.
[305:23.05]I put my fucking ear next to the thing and I hold it there.
[305:26.74]Hope nobody else fucking hears this.
[305:29.14]Don't hope nobody else hears this shit.
[305:30.60]I'm gonna be in big trouble.
[305:43.27]I'm gonna fuck this steak, don't forget it.
[305:48.66]I told you I... Like, what do you mean?
[305:51.12]That doesn't make any sense.
[305:55.94]Where the fuck do I go?
[305:57.16]I'm about to rage quit the game.
[306:01.41]Oh no, I can't be here.
[306:14.05]Come on the TV and say hello again, Peter.
[306:27.12]Is this it?
[306:29.88]You're too far in?
[306:33.02]Yeah, no, that's accurate.
[306:34.31]I really am.
[306:47.86]I just got $50.
[306:49.98]5,000 bits from Espada Escalada.
[306:53.55]Thanks to the 5,000 bits.
[306:55.29]50 bucks.
[306:58.21]Keeping clips is just another reason you're the best streamer on the internet.
[307:01.05]Also, here's $50 for your lawsuit.
[307:05.59]I... Look.
[307:12.14]I...
[307:15.77]YouTube did this similar thing before.
[307:18.39]And it scared the shit out of everybody.
[307:21.97]I'm gonna wait for more info.
[307:24.00]I'm gonna wait until it's really like, yeah, if you have... You're getting deleted.
[307:30.62]I want a little bit more info.
[307:34.06]I'm not removing six years of everything I've ever done.
[307:39.65]I'm not gonna do it.
[307:46.06]I want more info.
[307:48.34]Speaking of more info... What the fuck am I supposed to do right now?
[308:06.15]You should switch to Blender.
[308:10.66]I think the game's telling you to quit.
[308:15.52]Okay.
[308:22.28]This is like the only way I can really go.
[308:24.37]But I can't go this way.
[308:27.11]The elevator?
[308:27.71]Yeah, I can't press- I need a key for the elevator.
[308:29.71]I can't press the button.
[308:40.20]Turn cam on.
[308:41.86]We lost another hundred viewers.
[308:42.96]Stop saying that!
[308:44.59]Don't you know that when you say that, it makes me feel wicked self-conscious that people may have left the stream?
[308:49.69]Don't say that to me.
[308:51.03]Don't do that to me.
[308:55.73]Where the fuck do I go?
[308:56.98]I can't do the elevator.
[309:06.86]Don't worry, I know why they left.
[309:08.76]Because I walked in a circle four times.
[309:10.44]Because this game... I get it.
[309:12.98]You don't have to... 100 people... No.
[309:16.97]Why didn't 5,000 of you leave?
[309:22.37]But don't go.
[309:23.15]Stay.
[309:24.83]Watch me continue to do the same thing over and over again.
[309:27.04]Expecting different reality.
[309:28.12]What is the definition?
[309:31.12]Sanity.
[309:33.22]It's down...
[309:55.18]Help me.
[309:56.06]Help me.
[309:58.86]Why am I really trapped here?
[310:04.71]Why?
[310:06.15]No, help me.
[310:07.49]Why?
[310:07.89]Cry, cry, cry.
[310:10.39]Go to the storage room.
[310:19.49]The fucking storage room?
[310:22.93]40 McNuggets?
[310:23.61]Holy shit, that's a good idea.
[310:28.31]Storage warehouse.
[310:30.83]It's sealed.
[310:31.39]I think it's broken.
[310:32.55]The game is broken.
[310:34.98]The game's broken.
[310:36.38]It's a broken game.
[310:38.44]And I think I'm running around like an idiot.
[310:41.30]Door, it's not opening.
[310:53.23]Okay, how do I die?
[310:54.39]Wait, hold on.
[311:05.12]There's a hidden key behind the ladder.
[311:06.96]And you called me an idiot.
[311:07.90]But wouldn't a hidden key mean I don't see it?
[311:10.34]Yeah, the game is hard crashed.
[311:15.97]It's actually hard crashed.
[311:31.47]Come on.
[311:32.15]Are you giving me like a reason to end the stream game?
[311:37.97]For tomorrow?
[311:38.73]For VR scary night?
[311:41.94]Y'all gonna come to VR night tomorrow?
[311:44.36]It's gonna be scary.
[311:47.54]I think it's gonna be scary.
[311:52.30]Whatever plans you have tomorrow, whatever streamer you plan on watching,
[311:58.43]It better be me.
[312:00.43]You understand?
[312:03.05]I'm going to do a hundred nugget challenge after too.
[312:15.50]No, I'm not.
[312:19.25]Alright, well, this is a good place to end it.
[312:21.81]It's been five hours.
[312:22.72]I only streamed for four or six hours anyways now because of my boomer back.
[312:27.16]It's a good place to take a break and get some food.
[312:32.18]This game was terrible, but I had to give it a chance.
[312:35.40]How could it be worse than the first one?
[312:36.67]I have no idea.
[312:37.19]I got another $50 from Wade.
[312:42.07]Thanks, Wade, for the $50.
[312:42.75]There's no messages.
[312:45.39]That's it.
[312:49.50]Look, I had fun on the stream, didn't have fun in the game.
[312:53.54]Sometimes that's okay.
[312:54.34]That's a lot of fun.
[312:55.62]I can still have fun.
[312:59.95]So tomorrow, we are going to play VR.
[313:05.93]Walking Dead VR.
[313:08.83]The Exorcist VR.
[313:10.59]I might be making that up.
[313:12.37]A couple other scary games.
[313:16.61]Yeah, the Exorcist Legion.
[313:17.87]That's the one.
[313:19.99]Gonna be terrifying.
[313:22.65]And I think I might start tomorrow... I want it to be at night.
[313:28.36]There's something about playing a scary game and you take off the headset and there's just a bright sun in your room.
[313:35.52]No, I want it to be dark and nighttime.
[313:40.57]We'll see.
[313:43.73]But, eh, it doesn't matter.
[313:45.01]We'll start at 2.
[313:45.43]Pacific.
[313:46.03]Pacific.
[313:49.97]I know that's still late for a lot of people.
[313:51.31]Yeah, I know.
[313:51.67]We'll do two.
[313:57.35]Well, that was Saw 2, the game that half of you demanded I play for months.
[314:04.00]Hope it was worth it.
[314:08.50]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[314:11.36]Do a cam before you leave?
[314:12.44]Sure.
[314:19.48]Bye.
[314:21.82]How you doing?
[314:23.32]Good?
[314:25.14]We good?
[314:27.19]See you tomorrow.
[314:27.55]See you tomorrow.
[314:30.87]Do you like it when my eyes are wider like this?
[314:33.89]Or like this?
[314:35.99]What makes you connect with me more as a streamer?
[314:37.82]Like this?
[314:38.16]Or like this?
[314:42.30]Both?
[314:51.07]When you squint.
[314:51.71]Okay, cool.
[314:56.97]Let's get the credits rolling.
[315:00.11]Thanks for the subs, everybody.
[315:00.91]There was a lot of community subs tonight.
[315:04.67]I'm gonna go Uber Eats some... I can't fucking believe I couldn't read an analog clock like three hours ago.
[315:11.83]It's unbelievable to me.
[315:12.79]Like, holy shit.
[315:16.53]CBD, man.
[315:17.61]CBD drops.
[315:18.81]I can't fucking believe it.
[315:19.99]I cannot believe it.
[315:20.79]That's worse than the Omega symbol.
[315:24.67]It's the worst thing I've ever done on stream, probably.
[315:28.57]I couldn't read the fucking analog clock.
[315:33.23]I was trying so hard, too.
[315:34.37]That's the worst part.
[315:35.07]It was so embarrassing.
[315:36.78]And I'm sitting there desperately being like, what is the 5-1?
[315:39.48]Ugh.
[315:46.48]Like, you have to be making that up.
[315:48.16]You have to be pretending.
[315:49.82]No one can be convinced that that was not real.
[315:53.83]There's no way.
[315:55.91]It's impossible.
[316:03.69]Anyways, let's get the credits on.
[316:07.72]Thanks again, everybody.
[316:10.16]Hear all the subs tonight.
[316:14.28]Thank you for your insane support.
[316:17.74]That I continue to get for some reason.
[316:21.44]Thanks a lot.
[316:28.27]Somebody said, Jerma, if your PS3 is still making that burning smell, check under your disk tray.
[316:32.33]Mine usually does that if its oil is low.
[316:37.23]PS3 has oil?
[316:41.31]No, it doesn't.
[316:41.77]Like a car.
[316:51.05]What the fuck?
[316:59.28]I was imagining windshield wipers on this thing and you press a button.
[317:02.08]Just wipe the top.
[317:20.39]Alright, I'm gonna send you guys to Kitboga tonight.
[317:33.22]Oh, say hello?
[317:36.62]I actually saw the... He has this thing where it's like an AI that automatically talks to the scammers.
[317:44.59]It's like a text-to-speech AI bot or something.
[317:47.95]It's insane.
[317:49.57]It's absolutely insane.
[317:51.43]It's hysterical.
[317:52.17]I think he's coding.
[317:58.50]I don't think he's calling scammers tonight.
[318:00.72]I think he's just chilling, coding.
[318:03.56]That sounds pretty chill.
[318:04.52]I think I might hang out there with my McDonald's Uber Eats.
[318:10.54]Go say hello.
[318:14.49]I'll see you guys tomorrow for VR scary shit.
[318:17.29]Goodbye.
[318:17.79]Good night.
[318:19.03]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[318:21.47]Take care, guys.
[318:21.87]See you soon.
[318:25.03]Goodbye.
[319:03.75]Thank you.
