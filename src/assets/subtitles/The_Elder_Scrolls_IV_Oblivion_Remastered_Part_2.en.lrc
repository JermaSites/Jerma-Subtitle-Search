[01:00.90]Somebody said, thanks for recommending peppermint tea.
[01:05.21]You're welcome.
[01:09.47]Peppermint tea is great.
[01:10.51]I love it.
[01:13.30]I drink it all the time.
[01:16.58]You can overdo it, though.
[01:17.42]Don't do too much.
[01:18.72]Might be a little harsh for some people, but you know.
[01:30.62]been drinking it before bed?
[01:33.40]Uh, I don't think there's a time where you should or shouldn't.
[01:37.47]I guess maybe because it's a little... Yeah, if you're prone to acid reflux, maybe?
[01:43.32]I don't know.
[01:44.50]I'm not a doctor.
[01:46.96]I'm not a doctor.
[01:47.98]I'm a dickhead.
[01:51.91]Remember that.
[01:58.61]Today, those of you that are big fans of the RPG genre and that have been waiting for me to play this again, we're playing, I was going to say Chrono Trigger DLC, but I didn't want all the people that were here for Oblivion to leave instantly and hate me.
[02:26.27]We're going to play Oblivion.
[02:27.01]We're going to play Oblivion for the next couple of days.
[02:32.83]might play something else sprinkled in between or maybe I will see I have to remember how to play the game it's been like two and a half weeks three weeks since I opened it I did open it up to move it around and remember the key binds and everything so it's been like a month yeah
[03:02.42]I'm playing it late, but that's what happens on this channel.
[03:06.38]A game will come out, and everyone will be excited about it, and I'll play it a month later.
[03:14.93]What's the best Girl Scout cookie?
[03:19.96]The Thin Mints?

[03:38.50]Ah, that just means whatever.

[03:41.14]That's all it is.
[03:41.50]That's what it means.
[03:44.33]I might be live.
[03:44.89]I might not be.
[03:45.65]Whatever.
[03:50.07]Thin men suck.
[03:51.60]Get out of here.

[04:14.42]This is the way that Todd intended it to be played.
[04:26.97]Lemonades are the best Girl Scout cooking.

[04:30.66]Lemonade?
[04:40.75]How many Girl Scout cookie variants are there?

[08:45.92]I have not thought of that song in probably 25 years.
[08:48.64]20 years.
[08:50.16]And I still know the whole fucking thing.
[08:54.47]Somebody said, okay, we get it.
[08:56.21]Banned for life.
[09:06.34]Let's see if the ads start here.
[09:07.92]If they do, good.
[09:08.64]If they don't, then hey, we can just keep chilling.
[09:14.25]If they do, I'll be back.
[09:16.25]Let's see if they start.
[09:19.14]Have you tried rose hip tea?
[09:21.42]Probably a long time ago.
[09:24.52]With tea, I just pick the teas that I like.
[09:26.74]And then from there, I just kind of keep drinking them.
[09:29.61]They're on a rotation.
[09:30.47]Ginger tea, peppermint tea, green tea, rooibos tea.
[09:38.93]They go in a circle.
[09:49.81]What about cold brew green tea?
[09:51.33]That sounds amazing, actually.
[09:52.59]I don't think I've ever had it.
[09:54.57]I've had matcha before.
[09:57.66]Vanilla.
[09:58.28]Chamomile is up there, too.
[09:59.18]Especially for bed.
[10:02.00]That's a before bed tea.
[10:18.89]The shit that you read, man.
[10:20.48]Alright.
[10:20.95]Ads are going right now.
[10:22.00]I'll be back in a few minutes and we can get started.
[13:09.98]Okay.
[13:12.05]We're just about ready to go.
[13:13.25]We're going to play The Elder Scrolls 4.
[13:17.76]Oblivion Remastered.
[13:21.68]Welcome.
[13:23.18]Alright, let's go.
[13:24.63]You guys good?
[13:25.51]I know a lot of you got your popcorn.
[13:26.59]You've been waiting for this.
[13:34.56]Let's go.
[13:39.62]Uh, the last thing I did... I opened the save and I was just kind of in a cave.
[13:49.73]I don't know where this is.
[13:50.45]I don't know where I am.
[13:54.02]Why can I not move?
[13:57.84]Why does my keyboard not work?
[14:00.31]What?
[14:04.57]My keyboard unironically doesn't work.
[14:07.36]What?
[14:08.42]Do I have to unplug this fucking stu- No, I can't get mad.
[14:11.12]I'm supposed to be hanging out playing the game.
[14:14.27]What is going on?
[14:26.23]Okay, I just have to unplug the fucking keyboard.
[14:33.67]What is going on with my computer?
[14:35.31]Alright.
[14:38.34]Okay, here we go.
[14:39.26]I don't know what I'm doing in here.
[14:40.28]I don't know why I walked in here.
[14:43.67]I look sick, though.
[14:44.61]Look at me.
[14:46.79]Those of you who want to see my class so they can make fun of me, that's completely fine.
[14:51.66]You'll have to figure it out as we go because I ain't showing you anything.
[14:56.29]So where is this?
[14:56.83]What am I doing here?
[15:01.71]Alright, there's... Wait, I got... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:06.16]I'm a summoner.
[15:06.68]I forgot.
[15:10.48]Good distraction.
[15:16.95]Ow.
[15:19.11]Okay.
[15:20.35]Alright, I think that gets... That should get some clappers, right?
[15:25.02]That's enemy one of, like, four hard enemies in here.
[15:27.62]It's like... Oblivion's kind of cool because they...
[15:31.11]The dungeons are, they're not thick, they're kind of long.
[15:34.03]So they put four or five really difficult enemies, and you just kind of have to explore and be careful.
[15:40.84]So I'm excited about that.
[15:42.66]I actually am surprised I got the first one down.
[15:45.37]Okay.
[15:48.13]Hey, that's a nice cold open bit.
[15:50.89]Stop it.
[15:52.72]Money?
[15:53.70]Alright, so don't, I don't know anything about this game.
[15:55.88]I played it like for four hours once, and then for six hours, like a year later.
[16:00.73]Should I just not pick up everything?
[16:03.39]Pick up the gold.
[16:03.97]Don't pick up bows and arrows.
[16:05.21]I'm not going to use them.
[16:11.72]Alright, so what's in here?
[16:23.38]Does blocking disable all damage?
[16:28.50]Second skeleton, though.
[16:36.67]Grab the glowing crystal.
[16:41.40]That hadn't even been 10 seconds and you already are spoiling the game?
[16:45.67]That hasn't even been 10 seconds!
[16:48.13]I would never even touch these.
[16:50.03]What's wrong with me?
[16:50.86]Hold on.
[16:54.90]Uh, get rid of the club, right?
[16:56.01]I don't need to- I don't need any of this stuff.
[17:01.96]I don't need an... I don't need two iron daggers.
[17:05.81]Or I don't need an iron war axe.
[17:07.53]I don't need any of this stuff.
[17:08.74]Get rid of all of it.
[17:16.19]That thing's worth a thousand bucks.
[17:25.64]Okay.
[17:26.65]I'm not going to pick these up because I feel like it's going to be an Indiana Jones moment and I'm going to pick it up and a boulder is going to crush me and you're going to laugh.
[17:33.48]Nah.
[17:35.14]Go do that on somebody else's stream.
[17:37.83]What did I just drink?
[17:41.47]I'm looking for starlight.
[17:42.55]Where's starlight?
[17:52.13]Alright, get in there.
[17:57.28]You running away?
[17:58.06]Oh, dude, headshot.
[18:10.20]I pretended to care right there.
[18:11.74]I'm not going to lie.
[18:12.80]I pretended to care.
[18:14.26]The Oblivion community, I want to make sure is happy about this, okay?
[18:17.11]I just pretended to care about that.
[18:18.45]I want to make sure the Oblivion community is happy.
[18:30.41]YouTuber reaction did I actually pick up those crystals though oh dude sarcophagi he's got a bell burn him
[18:58.76]Alright, those of you that are oblivion wackos, should I pick up bone meal?
[19:09.61]No.
[19:15.70]This game's kind of chill.
[19:16.60]I like it.
[19:19.79]Alright, stone door to Yukanda Edsel.
[19:26.52]Can I touch this?
[19:28.66]I'm not touching that yet.
[19:31.12]What if it's bad?
[19:37.19]First of all, I gotta get Starlight on here.
[19:44.79]Okay, open very easy lock.
[19:46.43]Why would I?
[19:46.93]Who cares?
[19:49.32]Well, I don't want him to make it one and two.
[19:52.70]There we go.
[19:54.92]Okay, so... What the hell was that even for?
[19:59.86]That didn't do anything.
[20:01.78]What a weak Starlight.
[20:02.75]That's not what we're used to.
[20:04.23]Hey, boys!
[20:05.45]Boys and girls!
[20:06.77]That's not what we're used to.
[20:10.87]Should I pick these up?
[20:12.96]That's worth 50 bucks!
[20:16.76]One weight and 50... Take them all.
[20:18.36]Who cares?
[20:26.30]I don't know if I was going to get cursed or something.
[20:27.89]I don't know.
[20:35.13]Alright, you get him.
[20:35.77]Does he level up if he hurts things?
[20:41.40]Nice job.
[20:45.06]I'm going to make a shitload of money from these.
[20:46.37]Oh, what's this?
[20:53.27]I forget how this works.
[21:00.41]How does this work?
[21:01.47]It's been like a month since I played this.
[21:02.95]How does it work?
[21:05.67]You just go up and then out, right?
[21:11.72]That's it?
[21:18.90]Just wait till I can just magically open those doors.
[21:20.97]I don't even need to worry about it.
[21:28.49]Dude, I got them all.
[21:29.13]Alright, what about what's down here?
[21:40.23]Anything else?
[21:44.08]Okay, I have to do the first mission.
[21:48.05]I have to bring the amulet back.
[21:49.59]I feel like that's the first thing anybody does.
[21:51.63]Am I doing stupid shit here?
[21:52.67]Should I not be doing this?
[21:57.78]Your athletic skill increased.
[21:59.46]Can I pick these up?
[22:00.27]Can I hit them?
[22:04.85]How do I get these?
[22:10.64]I need a pickaxe.
[22:11.48]Do I have one?
[22:16.45]Shit.
[22:18.49]Wait, is it going to be any axe or does it have to be a pickaxe?
[22:26.92]Ooh!
[22:31.04]I got a ring.
[22:34.26]Go chop a tree down first.
[22:38.65]Okay, well, let's go.
[22:41.83]No, that's not my friend.
[22:46.76]Can you see what level this stuff is?
[22:48.02]Or do you just have to assume whatever?
[22:49.34]This guy's kind of tough.
[22:52.60]There's a lot of people right now that are probably sitting here going, oh man.
[22:59.98]To open up Elden Ring for the first time and not have any idea what's going on.
[23:07.35]I feel like that's where I am.
[23:10.55]Alright, what is this?
[23:22.12]Dude, I can't move again.
[23:23.36]My keyboard keeps dying.
[23:28.41]Do I have to get a new keyboard?
[23:29.69]What is... Uh-oh.
[23:45.70]Why does my keyboard keep doing this?
[23:48.02]I wasn't doing this before.
[23:48.94]This looks like a Dark and Darker map.
[23:55.77]Is that why I like this place?
[24:05.61]Nice job.
[24:10.48]Ooh, cool!
[24:12.46]This is like a fun little adventure!
[24:24.51]Burr gauntlets.
[24:27.49]Maybe I should take this.
[24:29.30]Hold on.
[24:29.58]Is this better?
[24:33.80]What am I wearing right now?
[24:36.36]Steel or iron?
[24:37.19]Which is better?
[24:37.65]20 pounds of useless sword.
[24:48.84]Is it really that useless?
[24:51.24]Oh, shit.
[24:51.62]Hold on.
[24:52.58]How do I get those?
[25:03.59]Hell yeah.
[25:04.37]Dude, I don't care.
[25:04.87]I'll throw everything else in the trash.
[25:06.38]I'll come back home with like five grand worth of lamps.
[25:09.92]I don't care.
[25:10.32]I wish I could get those.
[25:28.36]You can shoot them with the bow if they're too high.
[25:32.72]Cool.
[25:40.65]There's so much money down here.
[25:41.99]Where- where- I don't even know where I am on the map.
[25:44.04]Where am I?
[25:44.62]This is more money than I've ever had in my life.
[26:01.04]Whoa.
[26:03.06]That was a thousand bucks, dude.
[26:04.54]That's a thousand dollars.
[26:05.90]I'm excited about it.
[26:06.72]Should I be excited about this?
[26:07.72]This is a fucking ton of money.
[26:14.23]Oh, look out!
[26:15.19]Ooh, it's a ghost!
[26:17.84]Fuck off.
[26:22.29]Take his money.
[26:22.79]Do you have anything else?
[26:25.45]He's gonna have like a fucking ring on him.
[26:29.96]Take everything.
[26:30.98]They got a ring?
[26:31.79]Take it.
[26:32.69]Jewelry?
[26:33.21]Get it.
[26:34.07]Understand?
[26:46.28]I'm going to be rich after this.
[26:47.44]This is crazy.
[26:57.63]I feel like that's the end of the dungeon.
[27:02.70]If it were my dungeon, that's where it would end.
[27:07.63]Repulse the undead.
[27:10.55]What is that?
[27:11.05]Is that magic?
[27:19.79]Do you want to add Repulse Undead to your spell list?
[27:22.23]Uh, yeah.
[27:23.84]Earn Undead up to level 7 for 30 seconds.
[27:27.22]Cool.
[27:30.56]Did I do it?
[27:31.06]I got it, yeah.
[27:32.30]What was this one?
[27:34.15]Bound Gauntlets to... I already got this one.
[27:39.81]You can sell them after?
[27:40.67]Nice.
[27:41.25]Alright.
[27:41.97]Hell yeah.
[27:44.12]I'm starting to feel why Oblivion's a fun game.
[27:48.45]I think I'm good for now, though.
[27:50.15]Probably move on to Switch Sports.
[27:54.29]I think that's probably... Sounds good.
[28:05.38]That might be the most annoying thing I could ever do.
[28:10.01]No, no.
[28:10.59]I'm here, man.
[28:11.19]I'm here.
[28:11.43]I'm playing.
[28:12.29]I'm for it.
[28:15.11]I can't wait to learn...
[28:17.81]Engulf human in flame.
[28:20.55]There was another door I could go on, right?
[28:22.63]Your mic is still muffling you?
[28:24.74]This piece of shit.
[28:33.43]I thought I fixed it.
[28:38.99]Uh, where was the other one?
[28:41.92]There was two of those magic doors.
[28:47.22]This way, I think?
[28:51.14]You know what's really cool about Oblivion, why I like what I'm doing right now?
[28:54.94]The game is so open, and nobody can tell you you're playing the game wrong, right?
[29:00.87]I mean, well, I mean, my class is dogshit, but besides that.
[29:05.37]Why are you in first person?
[29:06.77]I don't know.
[29:09.25]I mean, you could objectively say that the class I'm playing is terrible.
[29:14.14]Which, that's fine.
[29:16.22]Ooh.
[29:17.26]Oops.
[29:18.32]How do you move?
[29:27.52]Shit.
[29:29.62]I don't remember how this works.
[29:33.37]There was a... There was a way this works.
[29:38.49]And I don't remember how.
[29:41.31]No one does.
[29:52.19]I get it.
[29:52.49]No, no.
[29:52.71]I get it.
[29:52.97]I get it.
[29:56.47]I don't get it.
[29:58.81]Because it's either it moves down slow or moves down fast.
[30:03.87]And it's when it moves down slow is when you do it.
[30:09.02]Because that wouldn't have just worked.
[30:19.51]It moves up slow too.
[30:24.79]There it is.
[30:25.97]I get it.
[30:36.72]Nightshade.
[30:37.52]I might put myself way ahead by having 10,000 gold in the first... Before even talking to the guy that's like, oh, yes, I'm the emperor.
[30:55.41]Is it cool to have 10,000 gold before talking to the emperor?
[31:07.30]Everyone does this.
[31:10.10]They do?
[31:10.79]I feel like I've ran far away to find this.
[31:14.71]Is this a case where the game is making me think I'm smart, but I'm not because every single person does this too?
[31:23.74]Why are you not leveling up?
[31:25.31]The emperor is dead, dude.
[31:28.49]Oh, that's right.
[31:35.30]Shit.
[31:41.44]I can't mine that.
[31:43.28]This would be worth so much more money if I had a pickaxe.
[31:47.29]The gate is opened remotely.
[31:50.49]Just, uh, never mind.
[31:52.75]Where?
[31:57.10]What's that?
[31:57.48]Ooh.
[31:59.52]Okay, what about this way?
[32:04.03]Stone door to the great forest.
[32:17.13]How am I level one?
[32:26.96]Did the game crash?
[32:40.87]Oh, this is the entrance.
[32:44.84]Oh.
[32:46.66]You can, dear.
[32:57.33]Okay.
[32:58.85]I gotta go 856 meters.
[33:05.84]Where is this on the map?
[33:07.40]Alright, I have to go here.
[33:09.32]Didn't I say no fast traveling?
[33:11.82]You mean to tell me everybody just walks up here on the first playthrough?
[33:14.89]I doubt it.
[33:18.72]You need to sleep to level up, or I'll sleep.
[33:34.32]Alright, I helped.
[33:34.90]Wait, give me this.
[33:40.09]Walk place one time, then fast travel.
[33:42.31]Okay.
[33:42.43]Okay.
[33:48.90]This is vertical.
[33:50.64]Can I carve these off?
[34:01.20]You need an axe.
[34:05.97]This world is so huge.
[34:08.25]What's the top right mean?
[34:10.12]That weird arrow.
[34:11.24]What does that mean?
[34:19.78]It means level up is available.
[34:21.20]Oh, okay.
[34:37.51]This game is beautiful.
[34:52.78]You successfully harvest Monk Shood.
[35:08.62]Are they the deer hostile?
[35:14.32]You can smoke that?
[35:15.43]Can you?
[35:15.79]Really?
[35:19.79]These are pretty.
[35:20.27]How do I get these?
[35:33.76]Why would you be able to smoke anything in this game?
[35:35.46]What are you talking about?
[35:41.73]Alright, I'm almost there.
[35:45.17]Oh, there might be something cool here.
[35:46.12]What is it?
[35:46.40]This looks kind of cool.
[35:49.04]Lindai.
[35:53.97]Uh, let's go here.
[35:55.73]I'm just going to keep... I'm going to look, whatever.
[36:00.24]Ooh, cool.
[36:00.86]What is this?
[36:03.63]Stone door to Lindai.
[36:15.34]All these dungeons look the same, you're going to realize.
[36:17.04]Whatever.
[36:22.49]I almost just walked forward.
[36:26.81]How much does this hurt?
[36:33.53]That sounded like three people got hurt.
[36:35.97]Did I get hit twice in the same second?
[36:43.71]Wait, I have protection.
[36:46.09]Alright, put that on.
[36:50.74]The fuck was that?
[36:57.37]Yeah!
[37:08.26]Shield spells are bugged, by the way.
[37:09.82]They make your shit break faster.
[37:18.47]Seriously, that's annoying.
[37:21.78]Wait, there are people in here.
[37:25.42]Get him.
[37:26.34]Where are you going?
[37:27.12]Get him.
[37:34.09]Alright, we have to go burn.
[37:41.80]Oh my god, I was getting killed in one hit.
[37:44.65]I was getting killed in one hit.
[37:45.97]Hold on.
[37:46.31]I have no mana.
[37:52.78]What the?
[37:56.52]What's going on?
[37:56.96]I'm freaking out.
[37:57.88]How do I heal?
[37:59.00]How do I heal?
[38:03.73]Oh shit.
[38:28.82]Mind your surroundings.
[38:29.98]I got it.
[38:38.11]My uncle did this.
[38:40.17]Played Oblivion and got killed in this area.
[38:42.26]Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[38:43.56]It's kind of hard.
[38:46.58]Alright, I think that was everybody.
[38:49.29]Gas.
[38:49.63]Can I do anything with this?
[38:59.51]Nice, nice.
[39:10.40]Alright, let's double team.
[39:18.68]Nice job.
[39:29.42]You got it?
[39:37.45]Nice job.
[39:38.39]Okay.
[39:41.21]Easy.
[39:41.55]How much money is a lot of money in live-in?
[39:48.30]What would you guys say?
[39:48.94]What is considered a lot of money?
[39:52.67]Thousand?
[40:01.23]Not messing around.
[40:06.81]Well, I got even more right here.
[40:08.04]Look at this room full of.
[40:15.77]Oh, OK.
[40:26.70]Give me these blue things.
[40:31.09]When was the last time you saved?
[40:32.00]A minute ago.
[40:34.02]I'll do it right now.
[40:40.43]Why wait for it?
[40:40.95]I can just jump over it.
[40:45.76]I feel kind of bad.
[40:46.32]You're just waiting for the door to open.
[40:53.05]Okay.
[40:55.90]You're jumping really high for a wizard?
[40:58.40]Yeah, because I picked acrobatics.
[41:06.36]I picked acrobat.
[41:08.22]I don't know why, I just did.
[41:15.61]Look at all this shit.
[41:18.86]I'm gonna have so much money.
[41:30.26]Good.
[41:39.35]Okay, that definitely muffled.
[41:40.81]There's no way it didn't.
[41:46.64]Did that muffle?
[41:49.79]It had to have.
[41:55.93]It did.
[41:56.25]It had to have.
[42:03.11]Your personality is being drained?
[42:04.98]Is that a joke?
[42:05.68]What do you mean?
[42:14.69]You're diseased right now.
[42:17.22]No, I'm not.
[42:20.74]You caught the zombie disease.
[42:22.42]I'll be fine.
[42:27.13]I'll go to town and pay a guy of three cooperative to take it off.
[42:30.14]It's really not a big deal.
[42:40.22]Uh-oh.
[42:43.83]Uh... Can I keep the bear pelt?
[42:57.70]Where are these blue things I keep picking up?
[43:05.73]Uh, where are the blue things?
[43:06.83]Oh, there they are.
[43:08.27]I have 33 of these.
[43:11.83]Can I get rid of the bear pelt?
[43:13.85]Drop the heavy armor you're currently using.
[43:17.03]Why would I do that?
[43:22.54]Oh, I'm not using it.
[43:23.42]I should just put it on.
[43:29.15]I should put on the mage's robe and like the... I feel like this is worth a lot.
[43:51.45]Throw away the armor.
[43:54.70]I don't want to do that.
[43:55.42]Is that bad?
[43:55.90]I mean, it's rusty, but they could shine it up.
[43:58.40]It's worthless.
[43:59.18]What if they get shined?
[44:07.49]Okay, fine.
[44:16.72]That was got me.
[44:19.78]What are you talking about?
[44:26.69]I don't know.
[44:33.14]Okay, I need to get in there.
[44:35.32]Need to activate a lever.
[44:41.37]I don't want to leave.
[44:48.06]Oh, this is the inner tombs.
[44:54.75]You can use those stones to recover mana.
[44:56.47]Bind them to your quick use dial.
[44:57.71]They recover a lot.
[44:59.08]I want to sell them.
[45:08.03]What?
[45:10.58]Alright, I need your help here.
[45:25.39]Are you me?
[45:26.24]Nope.
[45:32.54]Magic is sick.
[45:33.20]Is magic noob?
[45:35.85]Because I don't care.
[45:51.61]Okay.
[46:01.76]Hey, is it true that you took a vow of silence?
[46:05.54]Um... You tell me.
[46:13.75]Can I open this?
[46:15.26]The block has a regular gap, and it looks like it could be a keyhole of some kind, but there's no other sign of how to operate it.
[46:23.40]Did I get a key?
[46:24.55]Is it a rock or something?
[46:41.84]Okay, I don't think I can do anything else in here.
[46:48.71]Oh.
[46:54.46]You broke the vow.
[46:55.72]That's a quest door.
[46:56.86]Oh, okay.
[47:08.74]This can get open, though, somehow, right?
[47:10.34]There's got to be something.
[47:10.96]Where is it?
[47:14.56]Is it going to be like Elden Ring strategy where it's up there?
[47:17.46]Ah, there it is.
[47:18.00]25 gold.
[47:30.72]I'll take it.
[47:35.61]Is that on the other one too?
[47:37.13]No.
[47:41.16]Oh my god, that just scared me.
[47:46.71]Were there two?
[47:48.49]There are two.
[47:54.84]Alright, well, I can leave.
[47:56.04]I'll come back here later.
[48:01.07]Am I still alive?
[48:04.68]What the fuck, dude?
[48:08.20]What did I just save?
[48:09.20]Oh, it's right here.
[48:10.97]Okay, okay.
[48:17.84]What did I, what just happened?
[48:19.90]Okay, whatever.
[48:26.91]I didn't know fall damage was that crazy.
[48:28.61]Oh my god, I just dodged it.
[48:53.40]Alright, let's get out of here.
[48:56.64]How come you never learn?
[49:00.76]I did learn.
[49:02.71]Did you see how I dodged the spikes?
[49:09.17]I did incredible quick thinking and I made it so I was positioned perfectly to not take any damage from that.
[49:20.01]Anything else that I missed in here?
[49:23.03]Did I get everything?
[49:24.85]I'll be back here anyways for a quest, probably.
[49:28.22]I'll get out of here.
[49:30.16]What's this guy talking about?
[49:31.32]I don't... Shut up!
[49:33.80]Okay?
[49:45.36]This is kind of long.
[49:54.01]I don't know.
[49:54.47]I don't know.
[49:55.81]I'm not getting it.
[49:57.01]Holy shit.
[49:57.36]That's a fucking war axe.
[49:58.60]Give me that.
[49:58.98]This thing is insane.
[50:02.30]You've been streaming for like six hours, dude.
[50:12.94]I've been streaming for... What the hell?
[50:19.26]Alright, back on track.
[50:20.98]Head to the town.
[50:22.12]I did my little side missions.
[50:23.34]I got a ton of money.
[50:26.17]Pineapples.
[50:28.35]For those of you that don't know, that is how a pineapple actually grows.
[50:32.08]It is the weirdest plant on Earth.
[50:35.40]The pineapple just kind of grows out of a bush.
[50:37.83]It's so weird.
[50:38.61]It looks like an alien fruit.
[50:42.56]Don't believe me?
[50:43.06]Look it up.
[50:49.95]One day I want to grow pineapples.
[50:52.88]I feel like that'd be awesome.
[50:55.46]Imagine pulling a pineapple off of the bush.
[50:59.10]Like an apple from a tree.
[51:03.23]Oh, St.
[51:03.65]John's Wort.
[51:05.83]Say everything.
[51:06.35]Hey, what's that?
[51:07.35]Ah, dogger lily.
[51:09.84]Ah, but, viper's bug loss.
[51:13.14]Ah, ah, say it.
[51:15.05]Say everything.
[51:22.62]Pineapple bush light.
[51:24.53]Damn, that sounds like a good idea.
[51:25.83]Can you eat these?
[51:34.20]Are they poisonous?
[51:51.31]Alright, first mission is almost done.
[51:55.26]Are you guys kidding me?
[52:04.18]But what's that?
[52:06.62]Wait, ooh!
[52:09.07]Life.
[52:14.02]Alright, so does this work how, uh, like... Oh, I've arrived at Wayne and Priory.
[52:20.31]Now I must take the Amulet of Kings to Joffrey.
[52:23.90]Um, does this work how it works in, like, Fallout?
[52:27.00]Where, uh, some people have, like, four dollars.
[52:30.09]And some people have, like, four hundred caps.
[52:32.07]Is that how this works?
[52:34.73]Can I just take this?
[52:38.26]Is that bad?
[52:38.74]Just take one of these?
[52:40.82]I can just ride this right now.
[52:49.70]I just got a horse for free.
[52:54.96]What do I do?
[52:55.38]How do I make it mine?
[53:03.12]No one even knows.
[53:04.70]I can just avoid this guy's house.
[53:15.33]How could you prove it?
[53:16.15]It's a beige horse.
[53:18.89]Now I know that's my beige horse.
[53:20.65]Oh yeah, of like the other 50,000 beige horses that are in this town.
[53:24.30]This is my horse.
[53:25.08]What are you... What?
[53:26.30]I can't believe I'm being accused of that.
[53:29.33]What are you talking about?
[53:30.19]It's guards.
[53:31.35]I'm just as shocked as you are.
[53:33.98]This is completely uncalled for.
[53:45.00]Stealing from who?
[53:47.42]From where?
[53:48.34]I just got here.
[53:48.98]I'm new to town.
[53:50.86]How do you think I got here?
[53:53.31]You think I've walked?
[53:54.33]Do you think I've ran here?
[53:55.51]This is just... This is just ridiculous.
[54:08.37]Alright, you stay there.
[54:09.25]I have to go in here for a minute.
[54:20.37]Yes.
[54:21.65]Can I help you?
[54:22.53]Yes.
[54:23.59]I must.
[54:25.09]You know what?
[54:27.65]My business is private.
[54:28.86]Indeed.
[54:30.12]Another mysterious visitor.
[54:31.90]I don't want anybody to know.
[54:32.60]Well, go ahead.
[54:33.44]You know what you're looking for.
[54:35.16]I'll just go back to my reading.
[54:41.81]Alright.
[54:42.03]It's not between me and you.
[54:42.83]It's between me and Joffrey.
[54:53.46]I don't know why I just want to steal his seat.
[54:57.24]Let's just walk it in and just be like, yeah, alright.
[54:59.86]Pick it up and just walk out the front door.
[55:04.55]Alright, if I'm sitting here, is it stealing if I eat this apple?
[55:12.84]Right now I'm waiting for him to give the gesture of, oh, and there's food if you would like some apples.
[55:20.03]That's what this is.
[55:23.93]Would it be not okay after sitting here for a minute that I kind of decided I was going to take this?
[55:30.26]It'd be like, oh, apple?
[55:31.92]You have fresh apples.
[55:33.46]From where I'm from, we don't have fresh apples.
[55:35.52]We have fresh pineapple.
[55:36.85]You know, when I'm back here in the spring, maybe I'll bring you one.
[55:40.75]And then that's when he has the opportunity to say, oh, go ahead, help yourself.
[55:45.37]But he's not going to do that, is he?
[55:50.80]Hello.
[55:52.28]Alright, where are you?
[55:57.31]Where's Joffrey?
[55:59.98]Is it stealing if I sit on your couch before I steal your TV?
[56:08.32]Am I in the room?
[56:10.65]If I'm in the room and you keep pointing at my TV and going, good TV.
[56:17.03]Wow, that's a good picture.
[56:18.83]That's a great picture.
[56:20.40]The contrast is amazing on this.
[56:22.26]What is this?
[56:24.23]And I'm like, oh, it's, you know, it's like one of these LEDs.
[56:26.55]They're pretty crazy.
[56:27.47]That, wow.
[56:28.05]I guess I wouldn't be like, take it.
[56:31.22]Oh, yes.
[56:32.38]He'll be in the Priory House.
[56:33.44]You'll like it to have it.
[56:36.80]Wait, where is he?
[56:39.70]Oh, yes.
[56:40.87]He'll be in the Priory House somewhere.
[56:42.45]Alright.
[56:42.67]Priory House.
[56:46.15]Alright.
[56:49.11]Why am I giving him money?
[56:50.80]Oh, well, that's just the thing.
[56:54.97]You should be ashamed.
[56:57.58]I doubt it.
[56:58.96]Goodness.
[57:00.16]What can I say?
[57:01.18]You win this one.
[57:02.92]Alright.
[57:04.48]I'm not impressed.
[57:09.51]Farewell.
[57:10.61]I just gave you 10 bucks.
[57:14.29]Alright, if I summon a skeleton in the holy place, that's probably not going to be okay, right?
[57:20.32]I would say that's probably a 10 out of 10 of things that you shouldn't do.
[57:31.10]Does he care?
[57:31.70]I feel like this would be a huge freakout moment.
[57:42.78]He doesn't even care.
[57:46.81]Like, what are you doing bringing that blast from here to here?
[57:55.94]Summoning isn't evil.
[58:03.72]Oh, nice.
[58:10.23]Is that stealing?
[58:19.00]No, how do I put the sword away?
[58:20.00]I don't want to be intimidating.
[58:31.02]Alright, where... I gotta go to the house.
[58:36.70]I'm the shepherd here.
[58:38.64]Eren or is the name and this is way non prior.
[58:41.65]I told you I wasn't going to recognize it.
[58:44.57]If he's not sleeping or eating, he'll be fussing with his books.
[58:47.66]I reckon over in the priory house.
[58:49.56]So where is that?
[58:50.10]Enough talk.
[59:00.06]Where is he?
[59:01.02]Was he in there and I just I just was inside of there.
[59:12.98]I missed him?
[59:13.92]How did I miss him?
[59:14.90]There was only two people in here.
[59:21.47]Greetings, Argonian.
[59:23.09]Okay, if I ask somebody, hey, where is this guy?
[59:25.80]Why would he say, oh, yeah, he may be, you know, he might be in the prairie house.
[59:31.37]Why don't you just say he's upstairs or he's here?
[59:34.63]We're in the place that you just said that he was.
[59:37.76]You'll probably find him in the prairie house.
[59:40.74]Okay, that's here.
[59:45.24]Somebody help!
[59:49.21]Somebody help!
[59:51.71]Somebody help!
[59:55.21]Somebody help!
[59:56.74]Somebody help!
[59:59.72]Somebody help!
[60:00.64]Somebody help!
[60:03.96]Somebody help!
[60:04.44]Somebody help!
[60:05.47]Somebody help!
[60:07.79]Somebody help!
[60:11.08]No, it's gonna auto-save!
[60:13.72]It's gonna auto-save!
[60:15.39]How do I stop it from auto-saving?
[60:16.77]I have to hold F4.
[60:23.08]Wait, am I okay?
[60:24.00]Am I good?
[60:28.51]Shit.
[60:32.15]When was this?
[60:34.18]You can see him.
[60:35.42]He's fucking the ghost of Christmas Past is right there.
[60:39.67]Okay.
[60:42.21]This one's fine right here, right?
[60:45.53]Is this alright?
[60:46.45]How long ago was that?
[60:50.00]Your compressor is fucking up your audio so bad.
[60:53.34]I'm sorry.
[60:54.04]I'll fix it.
[60:54.72]I'll fix it eventually.
[60:55.63]I will get it fixed.
[60:58.35]This is when I first walked in.
[60:59.81]Okay.
[61:07.90]May I help you?
[61:09.30]Alright, we're good.
[61:14.70]Why is he... What's wrong?
[61:16.64]What did I do?
[61:20.61]Is he remembering from what I just did?
[61:22.63]I'm Brother Joffrey.
[61:27.74]What do you want?
[61:31.54]Alright, I have the amulet of things for you.
[61:33.94]No one but the Emperor is permitted to handle the amulet.
[61:37.12]Let me see.
[61:38.76]By the nine, this is the amulet of kings.
[61:42.87]Whoa, his eyes are wide.
[61:44.61]How did you get this?
[61:46.41]What do you know of the emperor's death?
[61:51.60]The emperor's last words.
[61:54.26]Weren't they like... As unlikely as your story sounds, I believe you.
[62:01.03]Only the strange destiny of Uriel Septim could have brought you to me carrying the amulet of kings.
[62:08.34]Okay.
[62:12.05]He said, close shut the jaws of Oblivion.
[62:15.74]The meaning is unclear to me as well.
[62:18.34]The Emperor seemed to perceive some threat from the demonic world of Oblivion.
[62:22.61]The Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon, is one of the Lords of Oblivion.
[62:27.10]But the mortal world is protected from the Daedra of Oblivion by magical barriers.
[62:33.03]oh I'm not sure only the emperors truly understand the meaning behind the rituals of coronation the amulet of kings is ancient saint alicia herself received it from the gods it is a holy relic of great power when an emperor is crowned he uses the amulet to light the dragon fires at the temple of the one in the imperial city
[62:55.21]With the emperor dead and no new heir crowned, the dragon fires in the temple will be dark for the first time in centuries.
[63:02.82]It may be that the dragon fires protected us from a threat that only the emperor was aware of.
[63:07.96]The hell?
[63:08.78]Okay.
[63:09.44]I gotta find the emperor's son.
[63:10.77]I am one of the few who know of his existence.
[63:13.95]Many years ago, I served as captain of Uriel's bodyguards.
[63:17.09]You're gonna look like this in ten years?
[63:18.64]One night, Uriel called me into his private chambers.
[63:21.18]Whatever, I don't care.
[63:22.02]A baby boy lay sleeping in a basket.
[63:24.57]Uriel told me to deliver him somewhere safe.
[63:27.87]He never told me anything else about the baby.
[63:30.31]Why do you care?
[63:30.80]I knew it was his son.
[63:32.52]From time to time he would ask about the child's progress.
[63:35.90]Now it seems that this illegitimate son is the heir to the Septim throne.
[63:40.57]If he yet lives.
[63:43.73]Okay.
[63:43.85]Where can I find?
[63:44.73]His name is Martin.
[63:46.76]He serves Akatosh in the chapel in the city of Kvatch, south of here.
[63:50.72]Okay.
[63:50.86]You must go to Kvatch and find him at once.
[63:53.46]If the enemy is aware of his existence, as seems likely, he is in terrible danger.
[63:58.77]And please, let me know if there's anything you need.
[64:01.87]I need to sell.
[64:02.33]I got a bunch of money.
[64:03.69]But I will help in any way I can.
[64:08.54]Um... I don't need to hear all this.
[64:12.87]Waste no time.
[64:14.27]You must find Martin before the enemy does.
[64:18.32]Okay.
[64:18.44]So, uh...
[64:21.42]The deal here now is I got to go that way.
[64:24.84]Can I sell to anybody?
[64:28.65]Greetings.
[64:36.20]Ask him for assistance.
[64:37.96]Should I?
[64:46.23]Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[64:49.45]I can't.
[64:49.77]These beds are all illegal.
[64:53.80]Your first priority now should be to find my.
[64:57.65]I keep a few things here in my chest to resupply traveling.
[65:02.71]Oh.
[65:03.07]He just gave me the green light to take anything I want.
[65:07.16]OK, so you just told me I could open it, so open it.
[65:11.82]Why is he pissed now?
[65:15.05]Now I can take his TV.
[65:18.97]Um.
[65:21.94]You skipped the dialog.
[65:26.42]Let him finish talking.
[65:27.64]Um, I can't.
[65:28.42]He won't talk to me anymore.
[65:37.15]What if I reload?
[65:51.53]The script breaks a lot.
[65:53.09]I'll be careful.
[65:57.12]Oh, thank you.
[65:58.62]Don't mind if I do.
[66:04.69]Shock.
[66:05.71]Yeah.
[66:06.91]How can I take it all?
[66:08.51]I'm just going to take everything.
[66:24.45]I don't care how slow I am.
[66:25.35]I'm going to sell a bunch of stuff anyways.
[66:29.80]Need to kill them.
[66:37.22]I'm not killing everybody in the first town.
[66:40.30]Are you crazy?
[66:42.90]Who can I sell to?
[66:46.75]Looks like probably somebody here.
[66:48.21]Fables.
[66:54.10]I can definitely sell to somebody.
[67:00.48]What's your problem?
[67:13.73]Thanks.
[67:17.85]Appreciate it.
[67:21.02]Thank you.
[67:22.80]That's very nice of you.
[67:26.50]So we're cool then.
[67:31.33]We're cool.
[67:31.81]You didn't care.
[67:45.67]Why would you give somebody that stole something... a cool hammer?
[67:50.16]That doesn't seem smart.
[67:54.52]Alright, what do I sell?
[68:10.22]Holy shit, that was awesome!
[68:13.00]Blacksmith?
[68:15.76]Is there a blacksmith in this little town or do I have to go further up?
[68:27.84]This is somebody's house.
[68:28.56]Can I go in here?
[68:30.62]Lodge.
[68:31.03]Maybe somebody in the lodge.
[68:34.45]I'm gonna take a first break.
[68:35.59]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[68:43.64]Let me... Can I take any of this stuff?
[68:54.33]There's nobody even in here.
[68:55.28]I can just take it, can't I?
[69:06.95]Sleep in this... Oh, I can sleep in this bed.
[69:08.59]You're right.
[69:14.30]Is this gonna be bad, though?
[69:15.12]Will somebody come in?
[69:20.41]Did I just sleep for one hour?
[69:25.40]Oh, shit.
[69:25.86]Okay, you realize that all your life you've been coasting along as if you were in a dream.
[69:30.40]Suddenly facing the trials of the last few days, you have come alive.
[69:33.44]Alright.
[69:37.19]Holy shit, I have a lot of points to do.
[69:39.87]What do I want to put these into?
[69:48.95]I don't want strength.
[69:49.93]It's got to be willpower and intelligence, right?
[69:56.65]And speed.
[70:03.80]And two points of endurance.
[70:14.37]Do luck first always?
[70:16.29]No.
[70:22.39]Alright, I think I'm happy with this.
[70:23.69]I don't like these... I don't like the odd numbers.
[70:25.46]It's freaking me out.
[70:26.10]I hate it.
[70:36.66]Your character looks like 1998 Godzilla.
[70:54.39]I'm just going to do this.
[70:55.35]Who cares?
[71:02.18]I'm happy with this.
[71:03.62]More endurance.
[71:06.11]It might be terrible, but I don't care.
[71:14.98]Alright, if there's nobody in here to hear you steal, did the tree fall down in the forest?
[71:47.34]Can you fly around in a room like a witch?
[71:50.57]That would be sick if you could.
[72:02.60]Logs?
[72:11.01]I feel like some of this stuff is probably worth it.
[72:16.58]Okay, well, whatever.
[72:24.20]Is your guy cold blooded or warm blooded?
[72:27.52]My guy is a person in a costume, so warm blooded.
[72:33.47]This is just a really, really expensive foam latex and plastic head.
[72:40.86]Is this whole thing was like probably 10 to 15 grand.
[72:48.92]Super expensive.
[72:57.76]Alright, I need to sell.
[72:58.56]You said there's a blacksmith somewhere here?
[73:07.73]Let's go in the castle.
[73:10.23]Alright, well, I'll take a break.
[73:11.32]I'll be back.
[73:12.76]We'll go in the castle.
[73:14.96]Saved.
[73:15.56]I'll be back in like three or four minutes.
[73:19.95]I believe I'll be back in three or four minutes.
[73:22.33]Sounds good.
[73:27.71]That's not working.
[74:15.98].
[74:44.87].

[83:33.14]It's haunted house, this guy.
[83:37.57]Oh, he's trying to spawn it in front of him.
[83:40.97]Here we go.
[83:47.94]Do I have to seriously go the long way?
[83:49.30]I'm just too lazy to drop once you sit on the ground.
[83:59.38]Drop something.
[84:00.04]I'm going insane.
[84:02.77]Gamers nowadays.
[84:05.41]You don't want to take a second just to enjoy a little stroll.
[84:10.43]Go, go, go, go.
[84:11.41]Get in there.
[84:11.93]Get in the blacksmith quick and tell everything.
[84:15.04]Then run, run, run to the objective.
[84:16.46]Get to the objective.
[84:17.04]Down, down, down.
[84:18.02]Objective down.
[84:18.66]Gun, gun.
[84:20.81]Gamers nowadays.
[84:22.41]Back in my day, we used to... Wait, what?
[84:30.18]Why am I not allowed in here?
[84:32.02]Is it not open?
[84:34.35]I'll wait.
[84:43.46]rp wait for eight hours what do you mean it's not open what time is it like whatever I feel like the old people that waited the breakfast place oh well they open at 6 30. we may as well get into the parking lot and sit in the parking lot at five
[85:18.03]When they open eight.
[85:24.63]Hey, you want to know something funny?
[85:26.49]I've done that before.
[85:30.68]And you wait till you see everybody kind of get out of their cars before you're like, I got to get out of my car too because I want to get in there.
[85:38.25]Because once you do try to get to the early bird special, let's say it's six o'clock in the morning, 530 in the morning.
[85:45.27]I don't want to, I don't want to go through, I don't want to like get in front of all the old people, but you want to be part of that kind of conversation of you're part of the old people.
[85:53.40]Because otherwise what happens is, let's say there's like seven cars that are all waiting for the place to open.
[85:59.50]All of a sudden, you know, Frank and Esther over there, they get out.
[86:04.03]All of a sudden, oh shit, here we go.
[86:05.67]It's time to move.
[86:06.83]Because boom, two more people come out of those, that car.
[86:09.49]Once somebody makes a move, you got to make a move too.
[86:11.78]Otherwise you're going to bet you're going to be eighth in eighth place.
[86:15.14]You got to try to get in there at like a Mario Kart placement.
[86:18.82]You got to try to get in there at least third or fourth.
[86:24.37]Otherwise, you're going to be behind all the old people.
[86:26.71]And we all know that old people order like 15 different items.
[86:30.65]Individually.
[86:42.98]Alright, here we go.
[86:43.67]I'd like to sell.
[86:47.92]Alright.
[86:48.96]1,200 gold.
[87:11.74]You're only going to give me $348?
[87:14.08]Is this worth $1,000?
[87:15.84]What is this horseshit?
[87:17.65]This is... This is ridiculous.
[87:20.07]These were $1,000 each.
[87:24.20]What?
[87:25.84]No, how do I... I don't want to do that.
[87:32.09]You need to level up your personality.
[87:34.31]Why does my personality dictate how much a precious stone is worth?
[87:40.39]You need to do the minigame.
[87:41.69]What?
[87:43.51]I forget even how the minigame works.
[87:48.26]They taught me a month ago.
[87:50.32]Okay, so you want to do the really good one first, which is probably this one.
[87:57.81]Then another really good one.
[88:02.14]I don't get it.
[88:04.24]I don't... How do you load?
[88:09.87]Like, big when good, small when bad.
[88:11.67]I know, but I just try to do that.
[88:13.68]Yeah, I get it.
[88:15.34]Are you serious?
[88:16.40]What is quick load?
[88:20.77]Stop talking.
[88:31.68]Go ahead, please.
[88:34.62]I'm listening.
[88:35.76]Alright, start.
[88:36.40]So how do I... So I need to...
[88:39.44]Oh!
[88:40.38]Okay, so I need to be... She doesn't like this.
[88:46.30]She doesn't like when you boast?
[88:55.57]You like jokes?
[89:01.28]Sure, that's cute.
[89:09.61]You're full of it.
[89:11.15]Did I do good?
[89:12.31]Not bad.
[89:15.92]Not bad at all.
[89:17.68]Don't, please.
[89:18.68]I'm sorry.
[89:19.30]I'm not buying that.
[89:22.53]You're pathetic.
[89:23.69]Alright, that got better.
[89:26.85]Don't make me laugh.
[89:29.34]I doubt you really mean it.
[89:30.60]No more.
[89:31.30]You're frightening.
[89:32.08]Good one.
[89:33.58]Okay.
[89:35.09]Whatever you want.
[89:37.28]That's a bit excessive.
[89:38.51]That's pretty good.
[89:39.63]You're full of it.
[89:40.47]Getting better.
[89:40.85]Sure.
[89:43.81]That's cute.
[89:45.08]No more.
[89:46.34]I'm not... Blah, blah, blah.
[89:48.54]What a bore.
[89:50.50]I'm not buying that one.
[89:52.43]Blah, blah.
[89:53.43]That's pretty good.
[89:54.35]Don't, please.
[89:55.31]Alright, I'm at 66.
[89:57.62]And here.
[89:58.76]Well, isn't that sweet of you?
[90:00.08]Take a couple of coins just because we're friends.
[90:02.60]That works for me.
[90:06.80]This is still worth the same amount of money.
[90:16.87]How do you... How do I haggle?
[90:20.28]What do you mean haggle?
[90:21.34]How do I do that?
[90:23.64]Press R to haggle.
[90:29.29]R?
[90:30.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[90:30.69]Hold on a second.
[90:35.42]Haggle for what?
[90:39.42]Oh, why do I?
[90:40.20]Okay.
[90:40.62]Easy.
[90:41.36]Buying items at selling items at seven.
[90:44.24]Okay.
[90:47.01]Expert.
[90:48.13]How does this work?
[90:53.83]So what happens if I do this?
[91:01.02]I just did it.
[91:03.02]I don't get how that worked, but I just did it.
[91:04.77]It just worked.
[91:06.54]Shit.
[91:06.90]Okay.
[91:07.36]Yeah, let's go.
[91:08.84]I'm gonna take all of her money.
[91:11.22]You can have one of these.
[91:17.13]What?
[91:19.99]Why?
[91:20.33]Why can't you?
[91:22.29]We just had an agreement.
[91:24.10]We just had an agreement.
[91:32.40]You're a monster?
[91:34.59]No, I'm not.
[91:35.71]Wait.
[91:39.00]You need to make a better offer.
[91:42.25]This is a 40% reduction in value.
[91:50.82]Make me a better offer.
[91:52.30]This is almost a 50% discount.
[92:00.17]I can't do that.
[92:01.29]Now you're killing me.
[92:02.99]You're just absolutely killing me.
[92:04.45]This is ridiculous.
[92:08.64]You shitting me?
[92:13.82]Well, I'm not doing that.
[92:14.74]These things are worth way too much.
[92:15.74]21 bucks for that?
[92:18.21]You're gonna pay at 20% value?
[92:22.27]Eat shit.
[92:24.65]That's a fair deal.
[92:26.00]What?
[92:26.24]She just took that from me.
[92:27.26]What?
[92:27.54]No, no, no.
[92:27.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:29.64]Wait, is it different values for different things?
[92:32.18]What about a gold nugget?
[92:35.75]You don't want a gold nugget for 16?
[92:39.06]Yes it is!
[92:46.43]What the fuck are you talking about?
[92:55.31]A skeleton!
[93:06.55]42%?
[93:06.85]Okay, wait.
[93:07.35]43, 44%, 45%.
[93:13.49]I think that's the, is that the highest I can go?
[93:16.21]Whatever.
[93:37.52]You drive a hard bargain.
[93:50.13]Merchant skill is too low, so she won't budge.
[93:52.03]Well, whatever.
[93:54.50]I just gave her a skull.
[93:57.14]You drive a hard bargain.
[94:04.85]Six gold for that.
[94:07.04]You've got to be kidding me.
[94:15.81]No.
[94:16.41]Fuck that.
[94:16.75]I'm keeping all this.
[94:17.53]I don't need the arrows, though.
[94:19.88]It's 100 gold, right?
[94:22.76]Holy shit.
[94:24.74]Oh my god.
[94:25.52]Those are worth so much.
[94:28.51]That's a huge moneymaker.
[94:33.47]That's a massive moneymaker.
[94:39.48]Okay, what about... I just put this on.
[94:46.83]I'll put these all on.
[94:52.18]Okay, what about... I think that's good.
[94:56.77]So that's it, right?
[94:57.41]I'm good?
[95:00.19]Train?
[95:06.56]Train?
[95:09.40]50 bucks to train.
[95:11.70]And maintain.
[95:12.30]Nah, I use magic.
[95:13.26]I don't give a shit.
[95:15.83]I don't give a shit about this stuff.
[95:18.11]Alright, what about, can I buy something else from you?
[95:25.98]Fine iron battle axe.
[95:29.42]Ooh, goblin shaman staff.
[95:32.12]344, I can afford it.
[95:33.95]It has some kind of thing on it.
[95:35.71]I think that's like wind or water.
[95:48.04]Yeah, that would have been funny.
[95:52.01]Well, I guess I'll... Did I just sell some of these?
[95:54.45]I feel like these things weigh way too much.
[95:59.42]I'll get rid of... 10 of them.
[96:01.88]They're just so heavy.
[96:12.63]That's a lot of money.
[96:15.87]Fine.
[96:19.70]I'm going to keep these two because it's worth way more.
[96:24.55]Soul gem?
[96:25.49]Sure.
[96:28.17]Okay.
[96:28.89]What else do you have?
[96:32.08]Cool.
[96:33.44]We're good.
[96:35.52]Let me put this other stuff on that I have.
[96:41.09]I look pretty cool now.
[96:45.30]There we go.
[96:52.42]Not gonna work.
[97:07.24]Is it illegal to go in here?
[97:08.98]She seems really annoyed that I opened this door.
[97:18.63]Oh shit!
[97:27.37]Nothing in there.
[97:31.99]Somebody's biography?
[97:39.68]This is worth a lot of money.
[97:53.29]Read us one?
[97:53.88]Hold on.
[97:57.63]Uh, yeah.
[98:04.59]Whoa.
[98:05.31]Cool.
[98:15.32]She's never gonna figure out who did it.
[98:17.65]Be long gone by then.
[98:18.99]Oh boy, oh boy.
[98:22.55]Okay.
[98:23.23]Be easy.
[98:24.49]Slowly get out of here.
[98:35.78]Oh no, I can take all this.
[98:41.61]Being getting out.
[98:43.49]I think I'm safe.
[98:50.88]As long as that door never ever closes.
[98:54.24]Uh, I think I'm alright.
[98:58.17]Oh my God, I can take everything.
[99:00.07]Will she forget?
[99:00.69]I have to ask guys, if I take everything here, will she forget?
[99:05.65]If I come back like an hour later.
[99:14.26]What did you come from?
[99:16.16]That scared the fuck out of me.
[99:18.19]How did you hear that?
[99:36.11]safe okay so we got a garden here now and the shopkeeper so as long as that door never closes we'll be fine oh but I will oh but I will
[100:01.90]What happened to the skeleton?
[100:10.61]So explain to me how I can't get away with this.
[100:31.80]I'm not seen right now.
[100:42.77]It's a percent chance.
[100:45.41]Did I do it?
[100:56.93]I think I did it.
[100:57.65]I don't have a bounty or anything.
[100:58.89]She didn't say guards, guards.
[101:05.58]Each gold is a separate item.
[101:21.42]I think I'm fine.
[101:23.04]Uh-oh.
[101:26.76]I didn't know that's what happened.
[101:40.75]We're good.
[101:53.74]Okay, I'm fine.
[102:02.85]Cool.
[102:03.33]So now... I got some new stuff.
[102:10.23]Iron helmet.
[102:14.31]I look like a fucking idiot.
[102:15.54]I don't want to wear this.
[102:25.99]What else?
[102:26.31]Can I do something else here?
[102:35.06]Uh, yes.
[102:39.17]Likewise.
[102:39.81]I'm pleased to meet you.
[102:40.79]I'm always glad to meet someone new.
[102:43.28]Welcome.
[102:44.26]I'm sure my mother would be glad to meet you as well.
[102:47.26]My mother would be glad to meet you.

[103:02.97]Sure.
[103:04.15]Alright, well, cool.
[103:05.33]Take care.
[103:07.00]I bought a fine mare from him once.
[103:09.80]A fine, fine animal.
[103:12.96]Be gone, weakling.

[110:50.41]Fine.
[110:51.41]Goodbye.
[110:52.82]You too.
[111:00.02]Good to see you.
[111:01.18]Good morning.
[111:02.26]Do you ever do any shopping at Northern Goods?
[111:05.09]Well, of course.
[111:06.49]I mean, there's always something there I need and... Ah, yes.
[111:10.84]You are a guild mage, are you not?
[111:13.10]I am.
[111:13.92]Yet different from the others.
[111:16.19]Yes, yes, this is good.
[111:19.09]There's a small matter with which you may be able to assist.
[111:22.13]I'm not helping you.
[111:22.90]It's nothing worth involving your guild in, I assure you.
[111:26.20]Best if kept just between us, yes?
[111:28.36]Yeah, sure, but just between us.
[111:30.10]I'm going to immediately, immediately tell what you tell me.
[111:35.65]Excellent.
[111:37.23]It's a simple task, really.
[111:39.44]All you need to do is fetch a book for me.
[111:42.10]The book is entitled Fingers of the Mountain.
[111:45.53]It is of no use to you.
[111:47.26]You won't be able to read it.
[111:49.50]I, however, can, and would very much like to.
[111:53.27]You'll find it in an old ruin called Cloud Top.
[111:57.37]It's north of Coral, up in the mountains.
[112:00.06]I'm afraid I don't have an exact location.
[112:03.81]Return it to me immediately when you have it.
[112:06.76]They don't have to make a choice here.
[112:15.68]Dad?
[112:16.16]Dad?
[112:18.61]Mom?
[112:21.35]She told me that there's a book in the mountains up there, Mom.
[112:23.62]There's a book in the mountains.
[112:29.47]Only both sides to always come out on top.
[112:51.38]Okay.
[112:52.36]Let's do it.
[112:53.84]Tell her he told you to ignore her.
[112:59.73]What does that mean?
[113:20.52]Big fight coming up.
[113:21.44]That probably means we're getting, like, invaded.
[113:25.19]No, we're going to play both sides.
[113:29.94]Alright, so I want to go up there.
[113:31.64]So, quests.
[113:39.11]Fingers of the Mountain.
[113:39.90]Okay, so let's do this one.
[113:42.85]That's not that far.
[113:46.47]That's right here.
[113:48.55]Dude, my graphics card's fan just went up to 100% speed.
[113:52.90]That was kind of scary.
[114:06.92]Alright, here we go.
[114:11.20]Oh my God, our first real quest.
[114:15.74]I was so excited.
[114:16.59]And I'm level 5 or something.
[114:28.10]How far is it?
[114:28.57]It's just kind of up here, right?
[114:29.79]Cloud top.
[114:30.93]We're looking for a book.
[114:41.56]Gorgeous.
[114:54.63]Look at that.
[114:56.18]Beautiful.
[114:58.40]So nice looking.
[114:59.34]Nice.
[115:02.30]Cool.
[115:02.89]Nice.
[115:03.29]Cool.
[115:03.59]Nice.
[115:05.17]So beautiful.
[115:05.89]Nice.
[115:06.81]Cool.
[115:07.57]Nice.
[115:08.15]So beautiful.
[115:08.85]Nice.
[115:10.44]Cool.
[115:11.06]Cool.
[115:22.31]There it is.
[115:30.72]No interlopers allowed on Cloud Mountain.
[115:46.39]You used to be funny.
[115:49.30]Yeah, maybe.
[115:50.74]Or maybe I never was.
[115:53.90]If you think about that.
[115:55.78]What if I just never was?
[115:59.09]What if you always thought I wasn't?
[116:02.77]Think about that one for a sec.
[116:17.48]Where is it?
[116:17.90]We just got to find the entrance.
[116:31.51]I need more conjuring abilities.
[116:34.12]I want more points in it, right?
[116:52.34]Seems to be the place.
[116:55.53]Spam conjure skeleton all the time.
[117:01.90]Oh, that counts.
[117:08.26]I guess I run out of mana, though.
[117:14.28]It does work.
[117:16.76]I do exist.
[117:34.27]Alright, I made it.
[117:35.57]Cloud top.
[117:40.90]Is it cold up here?
[117:41.66]Do I need better clothes?
[117:49.55]Am I going to get jumped or something from up here?
[117:51.41]Somebody's dead.
[117:55.48]There it is.
[117:58.48]Fingers of the mountain.
[117:59.19]I got it.
[118:02.72]I found the book.
[118:04.12]I need to deliver it to either Irana at the Greymare Tavern in Coral, or to Tychius at the Coral... Okay, I gotta bring it to either one.
[118:12.63]Who do I give it to?
[118:16.00]Okay, here's the ultimate play here.
[118:19.02]I tear the book in half.
[118:21.66]I get to... So let's say this is 100 pages.
[118:23.07]I get to page 50.
[118:24.69]Tear it long ways in half.
[118:27.22]Give half to that guy and give half to that girl.
[118:31.67]And just say that's what was left.
[118:45.39]And he said parent trap Andy.
[118:48.29]What do you mean parent trap Andy?
[118:53.51]Is that the plot of the of the parent trap?
[119:00.18]I don't get it.
[119:05.99]Read the book.
[119:23.55]I can't.
[119:23.87]Can I not open it?
[119:30.07]How do I read it?
[119:35.30]Yeah, they steal an occult book and they trap their parents in a spell.
[119:45.29]Can I actually not even read it?
[119:56.75]One guide, you can't.
[119:58.23]Okay.
[119:58.37]Alright, well I'm just going to teleport back.
[119:59.55]I think I'm going to give to the guild.
[120:08.36]Because my loyalties with the guild, I want extra bells.
[120:15.73]Bring it to her first.
[120:18.11]I don't want to do that.
[120:18.69]What if she gets mad at me for not doing it?
[120:25.91]Give it to the guild and you can steal it out of a chest next to his bed.
[120:28.79]Really?
[120:34.20]Can you actually?
[120:34.98]That's so stupid.
[120:36.52]That is so dumb.
[120:42.17]I'll try that.
[120:44.77]Yeah, but wouldn't that progress her storyline?
[120:47.46]Isn't that messing up my guild storyline?
[120:53.33]Give it to her first.
[120:53.97]She's easier to steal it back from.
[121:00.38]Greetings to you.
[121:01.72]What's going on with you?
[121:03.53]I heard there was some goblins around.
[121:05.09]I'll give it to the guild.
[121:09.87]Just don't get caught.
[121:15.30]What do you want?
[121:16.70]I got your book.
[121:18.70]You found the book?
[121:20.18]My trust in you was well placed, it seems.
[121:23.79]Hand it over, if you please.
[121:29.63]Ah, yes.
[121:30.57]This is indeed the correct book.
[121:33.03]You've not been able to open it, I presume.
[121:35.60]Then all is well.
[121:39.06]You have shown yourself worthy of the guild.
[121:42.07]I'm recommending that.
[121:42.97]That means I get leveled up.
[121:44.89]You shall have the recommendation you need.
[121:48.56]Now, I must ensure this book is kept safe.
[121:52.00]Excuse me.
[121:52.72]Good afternoon.
[121:55.29]Good afternoon.
[122:25.70]okay where'd he go where is he how do I get out of here I just got it okay cool oh shit
[122:58.54]Consul Andy.
[122:59.52]I'm not cheating.
[123:00.18]I didn't do anything.
[123:00.82]I accidentally pressed tilde.
[123:07.55]The prey approaches.
[123:09.55]Alright, what if I give it again?
[123:10.43]What do you want?
[123:15.60]Give it to him again.
[123:16.42]I have the book stored safely for now.
[123:21.67]I shall hold on to it until the council decides what should be done with it.
[123:27.08]Oh, alright.
[123:29.58]You got it.
[123:31.24]Okay, so he's over it now.
[123:36.93]Cool.
[123:37.87]Alright, so you're over it.
[123:42.72]So you're done.
[123:43.94]We're completed.
[123:45.64]Now I'm going to do the same thing to the girl.
[123:48.06]Put that velvet outfit on.
[123:51.61]I did get a bunch of cool stuff.
[123:52.65]What is it?
[124:03.39]I like that.
[124:08.86]I think this is way cooler than the other ones.
[124:12.90]Ooh, that is snappy.
[124:14.88]I like that too.
[124:29.24]Wait, this thing is stolen.
[124:30.32]Are people gonna know?
[124:44.06]If it's stolen, then yes.
[124:51.01]I'm keeping it like this.
[125:00.04]Cool.
[125:00.38]Alright.
[125:01.16]Let's keep going.
[125:07.47]Hey, my grandma loves your Han Solo dance.
[125:09.18]Can you do it real quick?
[125:11.86]No, no.
[125:12.28]It takes way too much energy.
[125:17.10]Takes an exceptional amount of energy.
[125:21.91]When I do that dance, I'm burning four or five calories a second.
[125:25.57]It's a lot.
[125:26.98]It's intense.
[125:29.36]When you show up, we're in the same fit.
[125:40.06]That's not good.
[125:41.12]I have it in my hands right now.
[125:43.52]Wait, what?
[125:44.18]I have it in my hand.
[125:48.32]I don't get it.
[125:57.60]You gave him the book?
[125:59.36]What were you thinking?
[126:00.63]And here I thought one of you guild mages might actually have a brain.
[126:05.13]Alright, alright, we can deal with this.
[126:07.17]You'll have to get it back, that's all.
[126:09.60]You're in the guild, aren't you?
[126:11.62]You should be able to walk right in, find it, and take it.
[126:15.07]And if you can't, then break in.
[126:17.65]I want that book.
[126:19.99]Bring it to me once you have it.
[126:22.76]I'll even still give you the reward I promised, despite your incompetence.
[126:27.69]Now go!
[126:28.35]Uh, okay, I'll go get it.
[126:32.49]Of course you will.
[126:33.51]Do whatever you must.
[126:34.81]I require that book as soon as possible.
[126:37.54]Okay.
[126:37.82]What is it now?
[126:39.18]I found the book.
[126:40.32]You should be working on getting the book for me.
[126:43.30]You don't want to fail me again.
[126:45.38]I believe I've made myself more than clear.
[126:50.49]I want that book.
[126:52.17]And I expect you to clean up this little mess you've made.
[126:56.54]Don't I have it?
[126:57.86]What?
[126:58.50]What?
[126:59.00]What's going on?
[127:00.34]Enough talk.
[127:05.87]Oh.
[127:05.99]Someone's back again, are you?
[127:08.45]Do you have the book this time?
[127:10.87]Yes.
[127:11.83]Here it is.
[127:12.94]Ah, wonderful.
[127:14.38]I'll just take this from you and get to work translating it.
[127:18.22]I'll need some time with this.
[127:20.21]Come and find me tomorrow.
[127:22.35]Okay.
[127:22.47]I'll be here until I've finished my work.
[127:25.85]Alright, so 24 hours?
[127:26.86]We're going to do Wing of Sleep for 24 hours and come right back.
[127:29.16]This is quite a delicate business, you see.
[127:32.48]Call the ghost of Lord Glyndra again.
[127:42.65]Is this technically not sleeping?
[128:00.45]Okay, it is exactly one full day later.
[128:02.37]And let's go.
[128:04.96]Where you at?
[128:22.46]Where are you?
[128:22.96]You said meet here in an hour.
[128:29.09]Where does she live?
[128:36.28]Oh, she's a quest marker now.
[128:39.28]Okay.
[128:42.90]Oh, there you are.
[128:46.27]Okay.
[128:49.46]Who is Reynald Jemaine?
[128:51.94]Why do I want to say this person's name right now?
[128:54.68]Yes, it's quite odd.
[128:57.11]Reynald, who I've bumped into several times in Coral, acted like I was a complete stranger.
[129:02.59]Also, he seemed sober, which is a refreshing change.
[129:07.88]Usually, Reynald is stumbling around Coral drunk as can be.
[129:12.06]Very odd.
[129:13.76]But then it's really none of my business.
[129:18.67]Okay.
[129:18.81]Bye.
[129:19.80]right see you later so when you put that book away that's what I'm gonna take it so we're gonna follow her for like a half an hour identify yourself what who the are you how are you fine good for you why was he so mad heard any news from the other provinces
[129:46.16]I've heard nothing good.
[129:48.20]In Morrowind, they say the man-god Vivec has gone missing.
[129:52.38]Some believe he has been taken by the Deedra.
[129:55.55]This is most disturbing.
[129:58.09]We can only hope this madness is over soon.
[130:01.33]Take care.
[130:02.53]Goodbye.
[130:03.07]Identify yourself.
[130:07.96]Can I talk now?
[130:08.44]Afternoon.
[130:09.70]I must put this book in a... Good day.
[130:13.14]Fine, I'll wait another two hours.
[130:25.78]Oh, I'm glad you were standing here too.
[130:29.02]What are you doing?
[130:42.72]Did I sleep?
[130:44.85]I'm just going to sleep in the guild.
[130:50.53]Is there a better bed to sleep in or should I just go sleep in the mage's guild?
[130:59.83]Guild is a free bed.
[131:00.69]Okay.
[131:11.83]Nothing's keeping you here.
[131:13.49]So move on.
[131:14.55]Alright.
[131:14.89]Up to the living quarters.
[131:20.24]You're walking around town with an AK out.
[131:22.48]How do I sheath it?
[131:28.11]How are you today?
[131:29.11]well f thank you alright so just pick a bed right why can't I sleep in this bed are these free oh
[131:59.69]Potion of personality?
[132:02.11]Alright, let's go to bed.
[132:04.43]I'm just going to sleep till tomorrow.
[132:06.50]Let's do, I don't know, like sleep for 13 hours or whatever.
[132:12.16]I got a break coming up here in a couple minutes, so I'll take it.
[132:27.58]I'm overburdened.
[132:32.63]I'm going to put this in the chest over here.
[132:35.49]Can I put anything in the chest?
[132:38.60]If I drop this on the ground, this helmet will just stay here.
[132:45.29]That'll just stay in the ground, right?
[132:54.28]Cool.
[132:55.09]Okay.
[132:55.21]Now let me go talk to her.
[132:57.03]I'll probably have to do that after the break.
[133:02.85]That's fine and dandy.
[133:08.62]OK, let's get out of here.
[133:15.89]The prey approaches.
[133:19.98]Oh.

[139:15.65]Okay.
[139:17.90]Welcome back.
[139:20.10]Okay, so now can I actually talk to her?
[139:26.82]Ooh.
[139:38.74]Spell?
[139:39.24]Did you bring it back?
[139:42.26]I don't want to bring it back.
[139:52.98]Fuck that.
[139:54.00]I don't even want it.
[139:59.15]Okay.
[140:06.57]What do you mean?
[140:11.55]Do you have them all with you?
[140:13.17]Can I have them?
[140:17.36]Or there's just pauldrons in the armory.
[140:19.08]I mean, that's the... You could have told me that there's hay in a haystack.
[140:25.59]Rain makes the ground wet, adventurer.
[140:27.90]Did you know that?
[140:29.84]Yeah, I know.
[140:33.52]Okay, so now what do I do?
[140:34.80]I gotta go back to the... Can I fast travel there?
[140:41.79]Alright, let's go.
[140:54.90]Okay, so... What did I get?
[140:59.17]She gave me something.
[141:02.02]Read the note first.
[141:03.48]Where is it?
[141:14.95]I just made a lot of people annoyed.
[141:17.04]OK.
[141:18.78]Oh, where is it?
[141:22.16]Can I read the cheese?
[141:23.15]Assassination.
[141:31.63]Emperor Euroseptum is dead.
[141:33.52]Oh, wait.
[141:41.02]I can learn.
[141:41.44]Okay, here it is.
[141:45.64]Most of the text you've given me is well beyond your comprehension, I'm afraid.
[141:49.49]Found one section, however, that had been appended by the keepers of the Imperial Watch, and their notes will be of use to you.
[141:56.76]Return to the ruins of Cloudtop.
[141:58.34]There you should find a section of pillar that looks remarkably unlike any other stonework present.
[142:04.25]Okay.
[142:06.10]The following was scribbled in the margins of the book.
[142:13.80]Do note that this sounds rather dangerous and take whatever precautions you feel are necessary.
[142:18.69]Only seems to function outdoors where it reacts strongly to magic, terrible power, capable of striking a man dead on the spot.
[142:27.04]Transported the stone to a secure location in order to study it more fully.
[142:31.11]Guild wizards brought into focus power of stone.
[142:35.20]Whatever.
[142:35.56]I can handle it.
[142:39.00]It's going to be like grabbing the two handles on the Uncle Fester arcade machine.
[142:43.64]Yeah, I could do that shit on hard.
[142:45.70]And it'd actually hurt you.
[142:46.69]That stuff was insane.
[142:47.97]I could do that and that's going to be fine.
[142:58.78]Find the pillar that looks unlike the others.
[143:02.98]Grab the two rods and have it just go...
[143:07.47]Do you guys remember that?
[143:11.97]That machine was fucked up.
[143:15.58]You could not hold on to that.
[143:18.96]I remember two people sometimes would do it because it was too intense for one person.
[143:26.85]Yeah, this is back when the arcade machines used to hurt you.
[143:29.47]And it wasn't a little, ooh, this kind of hurts.
[143:31.37]Oh, that's like a little tingle.
[143:33.28]No, no, no.
[143:33.66]If you held on to this thing, it vibrated your entire body.
[143:36.14]It was fucked up.
[143:42.45]It was a painful, painful vibration.
[143:50.06]I don't get it.
[144:05.75]Is this thing right in the middle?
[144:13.75]Oh, nice.
[144:15.09]There it is.
[144:15.41]It's like burnt candle.
[144:35.69]What does it say?
[144:42.93]Only since it functions outdoors or it reacts to magic.
[144:45.77]Oh, I have to shoot it.
[144:49.50]Okay, so I can shoot it with this.
[145:00.68]This needs to be a shock spell.
[145:02.39]Oh.
[145:03.39]Thank you.
[145:04.83]Thank you.
[145:13.40]How do I use it?
[145:29.92]Press C?
[145:40.29]This lizard can't read.
[145:41.45]Did I just use it?
[145:42.15]It's gone.
[145:44.08]He didn't read it.
[145:45.52]Wait.
[145:48.19]Read the whole note.
[145:50.13]Fine.
[145:50.63]Okay.
[146:05.49]Okay.
[146:10.24]Okay.
[146:14.49]Function outdoors.
[146:15.45]We're outdoors.
[146:16.88]React strong to magic.
[146:19.10]Okay.
[146:19.32]Terrible power.
[146:19.94]Cable striking the man dead in the spot.
[146:21.38]So be careful.
[146:21.88]It can kill you.
[146:25.15]It's in a secure location.
[146:32.22]Stone finely tuned to react to shock magic.
[146:35.34]Okay.
[146:39.19]Welkin stone necessary to harness stone's power.
[146:43.30]Success means powers of shock unattainable through other means.
[146:47.86]Seems that our Imperial friends were attempting to harness some degree of the Eyelid's magical power.
[146:53.45]Okay.
[146:54.17]I suggest you procure a Welkind stone for yourself.
[146:57.84]Searching the Eyelid ruins will likely be the quickest method of acquiring one.
[147:04.29]God damn it.
[147:06.97]But where is that?
[147:16.05]Yellow marker on the map.
[147:28.78]You sold them?
[147:32.61]Did you have any left?
[147:33.67]Wait, I had them already.
[147:41.09]He's so bad at Oblivion.
[147:43.44]Those blue $50 stones.
[147:45.56]Oh, come on.
[147:46.38]Are you kidding me?
[147:47.84]I sold every single one of them?
[147:50.91]You guys told me I didn't even need them.
[147:52.67]I looked over at chat and I saw at least a dozen people.
[147:55.22]Nah, man, you'll get fucking a thousand of them.
[147:56.82]Who cares?
[148:02.03]Okay, well, good thing my keyboard just unplugged and plugged itself back in.
[148:05.85]Is there another one I can get him?
[148:17.27]I feel like I shouldn't be able to do this.
[148:29.93]They have the white marble there all over the place.
[148:37.49]Well, I need to go get them.
[148:45.22]Just go by the ones back that you bought that you sold.
[148:53.55]Where are you going?
[148:54.17]I don't know.
[148:54.73]I'm exploring and this is kind of cool.
[148:56.21]I can go this whole mountain.
[149:08.50]This is really high up.
[149:09.66]What is there a summit?
[149:13.45]Go northeast of cloud top OK.
[149:19.68]I'm all the way up here.
[149:21.14]Cool.
[149:26.72]Am I getting invisible, Walt?
[149:35.05]Really?
[149:39.84]Okay.
[149:40.50]Well.
[149:42.72]Is there anything actually up here?
[149:48.47]sorry dog we're not fighting what the fuck alright well this is I'm north right now let's go north I'm gonna be northeast in a second
[150:21.24]This seems kind of northeast.
[150:30.05]How far northeast do I have to go?
[150:36.64]Promising?
[150:37.60]No?
[150:40.52]He hates this game?
[150:42.32]I actually think it's great.
[150:54.68]There is one.
[150:56.15]Lipson Tarn.
[151:01.16]Don't come in here and tell me that I don't like a game or not.
[151:04.33]Don't come in here and try to get in my head.
[151:10.72]Don't gamer psychoanalyze me.
[151:23.52]That was a long travel time.
[151:30.59]That goes all the way.
[151:52.97]Found it.
[152:08.24]Nice.
[152:09.32]Yeah!
[152:10.38]Alright, let's go get some more of those.
[152:11.69]How about, do I just need one?
[152:16.49]One will do it.
[152:24.76]Well, easy.
[152:25.18]There's one right here.
[152:31.65]Is that a zombie or is that a guy?
[152:46.73]Who is talking?
[152:47.77]What the fuck is going on?
[152:49.22]It's already just speaking.
[152:52.94]What?
[152:55.52]To arms!
[152:55.70]To arms!
[152:55.92]Ah!
[152:58.25]Ah!
[153:01.81]Crush!
[153:02.19]Crush him!
[153:02.65]Crush him!
[153:03.79]Crush him!
[153:04.37]Crush her!
[153:05.18]Crush her!
[153:06.64]Crush her!
[153:08.86]Crush her!
[153:09.38]Why is it not going up?
[153:12.24]Crush!
[153:25.68]That was dumb.
[153:33.69]She's not even here anymore.
[153:38.76]Oh, whatever.
[153:39.30]It's a different guy.
[153:45.19]What's the matter?
[153:46.67]Getting tired?
[153:49.64]Come to me, sweet flesh.
[153:55.03]Why won't it go up?
[153:56.45]Let's get this over with.
[154:03.14]Go up?
[154:03.78]Why won't it go up?
[154:13.19]Nice backhanded swing.
[154:16.21]This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death.
[154:25.98]What is wrong with this trap?
[154:32.00]This trap sucks.
[154:33.08]This thing is a buggy trap.
[154:38.09]Whoever did this, you gotta fix the lever, man.
[154:39.87]That thing sucks.
[154:47.02]Holy shit.
[154:57.95]Vampire dust?
[155:02.66]I can't even take this stuff.
[155:18.04]The shield is broken now, though.
[155:19.31]That's annoying.
[155:20.09]Oh.
[155:26.72]I'll get those on the way out.
[155:31.30]Use a repair hammer.
[155:33.22]Oh, you guys are smart.
[155:43.41]Cool.
[155:49.68]Alright, well there's one vampire.
[155:50.88]There's probably a few.
[155:53.01]Oh shit.
[155:54.99]Nothing to worry about, I guess.
[155:57.03]Just my eyes playing tricks on me.
[156:03.50]Does he have any money?
[156:06.88]No, he just took his clothes off.
[156:16.66]What?
[156:25.29]Oh, you can do that too, can you?
[156:28.26]Am I supposed to be impressed?
[156:34.33]Uh-oh, this is actually kind of hairy.
[156:48.46]Ow.
[156:49.68]In the head.
[157:01.83]Shit.
[157:02.33]Okay, we're good.
[157:07.55]Logs, dark green shirt, more dust.
[157:13.10]Is that better than what I have?
[157:19.21]Rusty iron shield.
[157:20.11]This thing is a piece of dog shit.
[157:21.65]Get rid of this.
[157:26.90]Cool, alright.
[157:27.56]Yeah.
[157:29.80]What is wrong with your chin?
[157:30.68]Nothing.
[157:35.15]These are worth a lot of money.
[157:47.78]I'm not going down yet.

[165:09.13]I hit her in the head.
[165:21.19]Yeah, you are warming up.
[165:37.53]Mmm.
[165:39.78]Lame war.
[165:40.48]Maybe I should take that.
[165:42.86]Here's the strategy.
[165:47.68]Bingo.
[165:49.15]Fresh, brand new.
[165:49.97]Not a single bit of wear on it at all.
[166:05.88]That's all of them, right?
[166:10.19]That was easy.
[166:15.78]Dude.
[166:17.57]Dude.

[167:01.58]I'm like level 7.
[167:03.94]Or 8.
[167:04.48]I'm at least level 9.

[167:11.81]I'm level 10.
[167:13.84]I've put 10 to 15 points in already.
[167:19.56]They're going to kill me.
[167:27.41]Oh my God.

[169:29.72]Where are they all?
[169:34.48]I am, okay, I'm, when we get back, I'm going to put my arm on the edge of the table and just drag across the entire table with all this shit into the trash.
[169:44.20]I don't want, it's time to get rid of half of this stuff, right?
[170:00.97]You killed her in one hit.
[170:02.37]How did you do that?
[170:03.61]You cut her in half.
[170:04.31]Oh, no, you didn't.
[170:11.90]What if you need it for later?
[170:12.85]I know I'm the ultimate fucking dickhead when it comes to that stuff.
[170:26.09]Get over here.
[170:28.14]Okay, whatever.
[170:29.94]Who's friendly?
[170:34.28]I want that.
[170:49.54]Good.

[170:52.93]Hold on.
[170:58.87]Alright, potion of healing there.
[171:01.03]And then potion of sorcery.
[171:04.98]Right there.

[171:29.95]Vampire sellsword.
[171:53.45]Good.
[171:56.09]Very good.
[171:59.75]I'm just eating this, right?
[172:00.95]When I pick it up.
[172:11.67]I'm not.
[172:12.05]Do I have to eat it from the inventory?
[172:17.80]Save the vampire dust.
[172:18.76]You can sell them for like 200 gold each.
[172:21.85]Damn.
[172:22.05]Okay.
[172:25.31]Will do.
[172:28.88]Is that everything up there?
[172:29.72]I think I got everything.
[172:35.09]You eat alchemy ingredients.
[172:36.23]You apply the first effect on the list.
[172:41.80]Interesting.
[172:45.84]You guys sucked.
[172:54.40]That was the matriarch.
[173:08.92]I want to eat that bread so bad.
[173:18.31]Bone.
[173:18.69]52 gold.
[173:21.02]Iron helmet.
[173:21.78]Iron sword.
[173:25.68]Blue and green outfit.
[173:37.11]Eh.
[173:39.10]Okay, now this actually is just Loki.
[173:53.49]Sounds like, can I... Do I have any, what does he have, green pants or black pants?
[174:07.65]Finally, you have goddamn pants on.
[174:09.53]I'm fine.
[174:10.09]I'm going to throw something away, though.
[174:14.50]This bone is cool, but it's too heavy.
[174:16.98]Do I need this for anything?
[174:18.34]A shovel for what?
[174:34.63]Maybe the iron?
[174:38.17]I don't need it, honestly.
[174:44.16]Drop the silver goblets.
[174:45.96]Aren't they worth a lot of money?
[174:50.43]They're not.
[174:51.05]They're worth nothing.
[174:55.48]Okay, there we go.
[175:00.46]So, is that the end of the dungeon?
[175:03.81]That was the matriarch.
[175:18.24]Oh, there's more.
[175:25.10]Why did I just drink that?
[175:30.33]Ah!
[175:31.41]I thought it was one of those things that, tongues, it picks you up.

[175:50.44]I'm playing the hard mode.
[175:53.03]I'm doing, um, still level two.
[176:05.42]I think that's it.
[176:13.94]Well, did you?
[176:17.86]Now I'm going to go shoot a lightning bolt at that stone.
[176:24.25]I can just teleport there, right?
[176:35.50]Yep, let's go.
[176:46.86]Who cares about level 2?
[176:49.23]Is that bad?
[176:49.95]Is it bad?
[176:54.65]I'll get to level 3 in a second.
[176:56.15]I want to finish this.
[177:01.28]Alright, now I have one in my inventory.
[177:03.58]Shoot this with the shock spell.
[177:15.87]Uh...
[177:18.12]Alright, whatever.

[177:39.42]Finger of the Mountain.
[177:41.37]Shock damage on target.
[177:48.04]Really?
[178:00.32]Ah, it's electricity hands.
[178:03.69]Nice.
[178:06.64]I actually would rather use this in the fireball.
[178:20.22]Astral Spiff.
[178:21.22]Thanks for the raid.
[178:22.18]Bunch of raiders just came in.

[179:37.09]No, don't do that.
[179:37.67]That's for nerds.
[179:42.13]Is it for nerds?
[179:42.79]Should I not do it?
[179:53.89]Do it after sleeping.
[179:54.97]I will sleep.
[179:55.71]I will sleep.
[179:56.27]I want to sell and then sleep.

[199:44.76]God's blood?
[199:45.90]You don't know, do you?
[199:47.46]Deidre overran Kvatch last night.
[199:50.29]There were glowing portals outside the walls, gates to oblivion itself.
[199:56.22]There was a huge creature, something out of a nightmare, came right over the walls, blasting fire that swarmed around it, killing...

[200:36.36]No, I don't believe him.
[200:38.54]Nothing can stop them.
[200:40.39]If you'd seen it, you'd know.
[200:42.57]I'm getting out of here before it's too late.
[200:46.55]They'll be here any minute, I'm telling you.
[200:49.18]Run when you can.
[200:56.97]What was up with that guy?
[200:59.57]Are they angry with us?
[201:01.29]You guys are good, right?
[201:02.37]There's nothing happened here?

[201:28.38]We good?
[201:29.05]You picked a bad time to visit Kvatch.

[201:39.47]What can I interest you in?
[201:43.93]Okay.
[201:45.55]What's going on?
[201:46.27]Go look for yourself.
[201:47.95]The town is gone and most of its people.
[201:52.22]The Daedra came out of the gate in the middle of the night.
[201:55.17]Why aren't you screaming?
[201:56.09]People who fought died.
[201:58.43]People who ran, they at least had a chance.
[202:03.88]If you mean the priest, I don't think he made it out of the city.
[202:08.44]Very few of us did.
[202:10.19]But Savlion Matias might know more.
[202:12.29]He's in charge of the city guard that are defending the camp.
[202:17.46]Okay.
[202:17.58]You'll find him at the barricade at the top of the road.
[202:20.80]He's still trying to hold what's left of the guard together.
[202:23.75]I'll take care of it.
[202:25.61]Somebody said, check and see how many diseases I have.
[202:27.39]How do I see that?
[202:43.06]I got three followers.
[202:48.95]What do you mean three assaults?
[202:50.35]One horse stolen.
[202:55.98]I'm good, right?
[202:58.54]Go to magic active effects.
[203:05.69]Drain agility, drain fatigue, drain personality, drain speed.
[203:11.63]I have hell joint, porphyric hemophilia, green spore, and hell joint.
[203:19.80]How do I get rid of these?
[203:26.07]Water breathing.
[203:27.77]I can resist poison and disease.
[203:30.41]Potion of cure disease.
[203:40.89]Oh, there we go.
[203:42.51]Bingo.
[203:43.21]Good.
[203:58.72]I don't think I'm... Am I alright?
[204:05.15]There we go.
[204:09.10]I can level up again.
[204:09.99]Can I sleep in somebody's stack?
[204:16.99]Level four.
[204:20.22]Okay, what do I actually really, really need?
[204:22.60]I know that I want to do... Let me see the details here.
[204:27.69]This is... I don't care that much about that except for the health and the... Yeah.
[204:33.33]Magicka.
[204:39.13]I like this.
[204:44.03]That's not a huge deal.
[204:46.12]I kind of like that.
[204:49.74]That's good too.
[204:58.97]I'm going to do magic every time.
[205:01.08]Let's get this a 50.
[205:13.36]How's that?
[205:20.37]You should do more luck.
[205:23.28]I want to be able to summon more interesting things.
[205:28.41]Alright, somebody was at the top of the hill up here.
[205:32.13]Go back to Chrono Trigger, Unfaithful Streamer.
[205:34.95]I beat it already.
[205:36.78]I got to the end.
[205:37.42]It was great.
[205:38.40]It was a wonderful experience.
[205:43.44]and it's currently on the Stream Archive channel in its entirety.
[205:48.94]The Stream Archive channel is a great place for you to find any full streams that you may have missed.
[205:55.46]The Jerma Stream Archive channel and also the second channel, Second Jerma.
[206:02.49]Every so often you'll probably see some edits there editing down the content you see on this stream.
[206:12.14]Instead of a five to seven hour broadcast, bring it down to a solid 45 minutes to an hour.
[206:18.07]Sometimes 30 minutes.
[206:22.39]What is going on here?
[206:35.66]This is cool looking.
[206:40.47]Oh, I gotta bind the shock spell.
[206:49.30]I want heal minor wounds at 1.
[206:52.70]Summon skeletons, fine.
[206:53.71]I want... Where is it?
[206:59.61]Finger of the Mountain at 3.
[207:05.30]I haven't even used this once.
[207:06.85]Let's do Flare at 4, because there's probably enemies that could be affected by it.
[207:12.78]Let's put...
[207:14.73]Clairvoyance here in case I get lost.
[207:17.19]And then the healing potions are fine.
[207:19.82]Okay.
[207:20.54]Seven is mana, eight is healing.
[207:30.41]Damn.
[207:35.30]Wait, are these guys bad?
[207:40.83]Oh, watch out, watch out.
[207:41.83]I got this.
[207:45.97]stand back civilian this is my next for you get back to the encampment at once the only thing we can do we'll try to hold our ground that's what if we can't hold this barricade those beasts could march right down and overrun the encampment I have to try civilian I'm I guess I technically am it's all I can do now
[208:14.87]my home my god damn home in flames it kills me that I can't get in there and I'll get in there I could do it couldn't have been any less prepared for this seems like they came out of nowhere there were just so many of them if only I had a way to strike back at the enemy but we can't leave the barricade until that oblivion gate is closed
[208:39.14]I can help.
[208:39.56]You want to help?
[208:41.28]You're kidding, right?
[208:43.44]If you're serious, maybe I can put you to use.
[208:46.11]It'll likely mean your death, though.
[208:48.65]Are you sure?
[208:49.29]I'm very sure.
[208:51.51]I don't know how to close this gate, but it must be possible because the enemy closed the ones they opened during the initial attack.
[209:00.90]You can see the marks on the ground where they were.
[209:03.98]Go.
[209:06.66]Okay.
[209:29.80]some kind of portal to oblivion so be careful that portal attacked the city they appeared outside the wall they've opened one right in front of the city gates close this close that gate you mean the priest last night if he's lucky he's trapped okay good luck so we got a lot of stuff to do now you guys walk in the oh let's just walk in the oblivion gate and just everybody up
[209:58.59]Let me get the power of the gods first.
[210:21.59]I can just walk right through that.
[210:27.34]Alright, find the air.
[210:29.08]Break the sea.
[210:29.86]Let me break the siege.
[210:31.70]We'll go do that.
[210:41.71]Into oblivion.
[210:50.88]Whoa, I've never seen this before.
[210:52.44]This is crazy.
[211:08.90]Let's work.
[211:10.89]Alright, stop the siege.
[211:11.69]That's all I gotta do.
[211:15.37]Very Doom-like.
[211:18.48]He doesn't sound excited at all.
[211:20.64]I'm kidding.
[211:24.85]It's pretty messed up.
[211:32.56]Got it.
[211:33.52]No, stay with me!
[211:51.83]You're right.
[211:53.16]I can't just leave poor Minion to his fate.
[211:56.16]If he's still alive, we've got to try to save him.
[211:58.84]Alright, lead the way.
[212:00.06]Let's find Minion and get out of here.
[212:01.91]Alright, we got a new best friend.
[212:04.15]I need all the help I'm going to get.
[212:06.93]Alright, so across the bridge, let's just go in the front door.
[212:10.80]And knock loudly.
[212:18.39]Very cool looking though.
[212:30.21]Watch your step down here.
[212:41.79]Alright, let's go this way.
[212:46.39]What the fuck?
[212:47.09]The trees are alive.
[212:49.52]Go investigate that.
[213:00.11]Like I got it, whatever it is.
[213:09.15]Blood grass.
[213:20.97]Alright, all jokes aside, the game actually is very pretty.
[213:24.57]Looks great.
[213:35.50]I will.
[213:36.52]Whoops.
[213:38.74]I'm so sorry.
[213:42.39]I'm not going to use any spells.
[213:43.37]I'm just going to summon my friend.
[213:44.49]Spittle stick?
[214:01.45]My speed's draining?
[214:02.83]Why is my speed going down?
[214:14.38]Fleshy pod.
[214:21.23]That'll get a dumber adventurer, not me.
[214:28.05]I should get as much of this as I can hold, right?
[214:34.10]They're kind of weak.
[214:40.91]I don't have to really worry about this.
[214:44.38]Touch the flesh pod?
[214:45.36]I just did.
[214:49.99]They really want you to get hit by this.
[214:51.55]They want you to walk too fast and die.
[214:57.60]That's the second time I've missed it.
[215:07.95]Again?
[215:08.21]Again?
[215:17.54]Watch out.
[215:21.81]I like this one.
[215:22.35]It's kind of good.
[215:25.07]What's wrong with this one?
[215:26.15]People saying this one sucks.
[215:28.04]This is pretty good.
[215:33.44]Don't stand next to get out of the way.
[215:39.25]It's scaled to your level.
[215:42.26]Oh.
[215:55.26]How much health does he have?
[216:14.98]They're in the tower, right?
[216:29.26]This is an AI title.
[216:31.64]What is the title?
[216:43.52]What's the title?
[216:44.44]Acrobatic Mesmerizing Magician.
[216:47.41]It's an AI title.
[216:49.43]What do you mean like an AI made it up or like generated it?
[217:04.63]Now it's my turn, you bastards.
[217:09.28]Careful.
[217:13.22]You'll never take me down.
[217:13.76]He's almost dead.
[217:15.61]You took a lot of... Can I heal him?
[217:24.10]How do I do that?
[217:27.32]What's mesmerizing?
[217:28.45]High illusion?
[217:29.13]Isn't that what my character is?
[217:31.73]I can go invisible, and I can summon people, and I can jump around.
[217:39.00]It's a bunch of word salad.
[217:54.36]That's the best you can do?
[218:01.55]Okay, I gotta be honest, this doesn't really feel like an invasion.
[218:07.17]It feels like there's not a bunch of monsters here.
[218:19.15]Honestly, these weird rape trees are more dangerous than the little monsters.
[218:26.41]It's because of your level.
[218:27.59]It's because I'm level three.
[218:30.20]Well, what level are you supposed to be here?
[218:31.94]This is the first mission of the fucking game.
[218:33.77]What do you mean?
[218:34.49]This is mission two of the game.
[218:37.87]Why would I not be level two?
[218:53.81]Let's find many of these.
[218:54.79]Get out of here.
[218:59.63]no I'm not complaining I think it's just funny that there's like two monsters running around it's like the invasion look out oh six of them six little goblins run for your life magic essence
[219:37.84]What do we do with this thing?
[219:39.66]Shut it down?
[219:58.52]Wait.
[219:59.66]Where's my starlight?
[220:03.00]Where is it?
[220:05.67]Is this even bound?
[220:06.33]No.
[220:16.26]Thank you.
[220:17.04]Let's go.
[220:23.09]Who's this guy?
[220:27.48]Alright.
[220:30.52]This guy's kind of weird.
[220:32.36]Get him!
[220:35.95]I gotta... Okay.
[220:36.67]I gotta... Here's something else.
[220:38.41]This guy's got perfect veneer teeth.
[220:41.90]I would imagine it would be covered in sludge.
[220:44.02]Your teeth are perfect.
[220:49.08]Those teeth are way too clean.
[220:51.99]I feel like the dental in Oblivion shouldn't be this way.
[220:56.47]Is he dead?
[221:00.48]Oh, no.
[221:04.23]He's dead.
[221:04.79]He's actually dead.
[221:06.15]Oh, no.
[221:11.12]Can I wear his...
[221:15.90]Yeah, this stuff looks kind of good, doesn't it?
[221:23.89]I didn't know he could actually die I thought he was an important NPC
[221:56.55]Absorb minimal magicka.
[222:11.25]Looks like this sells for a lot.
[222:17.72]Blood fountain.
[222:25.78]Go to the Blood Feast.
[222:27.56]Eww!
[222:35.87]Is this better?
[222:36.31]I'll try it.

[223:14.30]Oh, Rita had a Reese's.
[223:16.86]Rita, have you ever had a Reese's before?
[223:32.53]How is this a blood feast?
[223:44.95]I was imagining there's a bunch of people drinking blood around a dinner table.
[223:56.39]I feel... I don't have any friends and it pisses me off.
[224:19.13]oh run run from them they are gonna kill us all magic is pretty good

[234:39.59]Thank you.
[234:40.07]Appreciate it.
[235:01.56]Wise words.
[235:03.06]The Belief Aqua Bomb is the moisturizer I use every day.
[235:07.38]It is the moisturizer I have used for over 10 years straight.
[235:12.51]A decade.
[235:13.63]I've used it for 10 years straight every day.
[235:22.32]Where the hell are you?
[235:37.11]This feels great.
[235:43.48]Water breathing, potion of the sea.
[235:54.29]Does this thing go up?
[236:04.76]Hello.
[236:07.69]Where's he going?
[236:18.63]Bye.
[236:32.61]Goodbye.
[236:43.33]Door to... Oh, okay.
[236:46.98]Very easy lockpick.
[236:48.54]I feel like that would be not a great thing to have at your demon door.
[236:54.19]I feel like you don't go to Home Depot and get the $15 off the rack padlock.
[236:57.95]What?
[236:58.79]Did he come back up here?
[237:14.82]Well, if you're on a budget, yeah.
[237:30.24]Alright, well, what's in here?
[237:34.75]This place is kind of huge.
[237:38.12]This place is really empty at low levels.
[237:48.11]Holy shit.
[237:53.34]What is this?
[237:53.94]Burden of Sin.
[237:54.90]I want it.
[237:58.75]Frenzy.
[237:59.25]Inspiring touch.
[238:00.01]Absorbs.
[238:00.51]This guy had a lot of stuff.
[238:01.88]Pearl.
[238:05.06]This guy was absolutely cracked out.
[238:06.72]He had so much stuff.
[238:36.01]Okay, we're good.
[238:53.66]What is this character?
[238:54.54]That's a good reaction to this character, I think.
[239:09.30]Is somebody alive down here?
[239:12.32]He didn't come back to life, did he?
[239:26.04]What the fuck just happened?
[239:29.11]What killed me?
[239:30.91]What the hell just killed me?
[239:36.36]Dude, this was like 30 minutes ago.
[239:45.61]Was it that long ago?
[239:46.64]No, it wasn't, was it?
[239:53.35]Oh, the stream's been going for... Okay.
[239:57.21]I just saw the time on the clock.
[240:01.94]Alright, we're good.
[240:03.58]What about all that cool stuff that I just got?
[240:06.09]It's still there.
[240:19.48]Is this guy ready?
[240:20.08]This guy had everything.
[240:24.41]Okay, good.
[240:27.37]He didn't drop his weapon, though.
[240:29.04]That thing was awesome.
[240:30.50]It was worth 200-something bucks.
[240:43.38]Ooh, there it is.
[240:44.22]Yeah, nice.
[240:46.20]Alright, now I gotta get rid of all this crap.
[240:49.00]Get rid of the steel, the iron longsword.
[240:51.24]Get rid of the bone.
[240:59.39]Bone.
[240:59.75]I don't know what else to throw away.
[241:21.77]Eat the bread again.
[241:22.57]Oh, good idea.
[241:23.85]What the hell is my bread?
[241:36.57]Okay, then I'll take... Look at all these potions.
[241:39.74]Eat the cheese.
[241:40.42]I have so much junk.
[241:43.79]Look at all this crap in here.
[241:47.71]Look at how far I have to scroll to get to the bottom of this.
[241:51.59]Awful.
[241:59.86]Alright.
[242:00.04]David here.
[242:00.48]Let's go.
[242:10.31]So now where do I go?
[242:13.09]Oh, I can go up there.
[242:22.35]Good job.
[242:41.78]I imagine I can do something with these hearts, right?
[242:45.63]Eventually.
[242:52.52]Damn.
[242:54.32]Long sword of diminishing.
[242:56.93]Well, gonna have to look at that later.
[242:59.87]Alright, now turn this off.
[243:10.37]Do I have to run?
[243:25.34]I've closed the gate and I did it.
[243:28.41]Nice.
[243:40.74]I just beat the game.
[243:44.71]There's probably 15 Oblivion portals in the game.
[243:49.91]So now what?
[243:53.46]this thing seems pretty good save before you touch a sigil stone you can re-roll it if it's oh that's cool alright well let me let me complete this
[244:25.27]Got a burning sword now.
[244:30.71]What happens when you close all the portals?
[244:47.08]The alien invasion is over.
[244:53.79]The longer we wait, the smaller our window of opportunity.
[244:58.59]I'm not ready.
[244:59.15]I want there's a couple of then I want to go to the other chance to rescue the survivors from the channel.
[245:08.16]I have.
[245:09.75]Three of the things to do here.
[245:13.91]I want to find the air.
[245:24.87]He's barricaded where?
[245:27.65]Chapel of Akatosh, inside the city.
[245:39.75]Oh, do I have to finish this?
[245:41.01]I thought we were going somewhere else.
[245:47.87]I'm ready.
[245:55.87]I do not fit in.
[246:00.71]Look at WWE 2K15 created character.
[246:03.94]I do not belong in this universe.
[246:20.88]Alright, that is what I'm talking about.
[246:24.06]Alright, here we go.
[246:28.29]There's weird velociraptors and shit here.
[246:34.47]This killed it in one swing.
[246:39.96]This weapon is crazy.
[246:57.30]I did it.
[247:02.39]Uh, take it all.
[247:07.98]I've got too much stuff again.
[247:09.42]I'm putting points in strength.
[247:11.12]I'm doing it.
[247:12.16]I don't care if it's bad.
[247:12.98]261 out of 220.
[247:28.48]What can I get rid of?
[247:32.41]337.
[247:34.45]Whatever.
[247:38.64]You get 500 pounds of capacity at 100 strength.
[247:40.76]That's so much better.
[247:42.14]If we make it through this alive.
[247:46.53]We wipe the bastards out.
[247:48.99]It's safe to pull those people out of the chapel.
[247:51.13]Let's get in there and make sure they're alright.
[247:52.86]Be an alchemy god.
[247:53.26]You don't even need strength.
[247:54.04]Come on.
[247:54.56]This is only the beginning of the battle for Kvatch.
[247:57.04]We can discuss the next phase once the civilians are safe.
[248:01.95]Okay.
[248:08.61]he's in here right by the god soldier sir we're all that's left barack indian myself and these civilians that's it there's no one else there were others sir but they refused to let this happen are they angry with it
[248:32.92]very well the area outside the chapel has been cleared and these people need to be taken to safety escort them to the camp south of here at once but sir I want to help fight you will soldier once they're secure get back here immediately we'll need every available blade and there'll be plenty of fighting to go around how bad do you think inside of this room smells civilians it's time to move out let's go
[249:03.06]I feel like it smells like, just, like, I don't know.
[249:07.61]Like smoke and cheese.
[249:11.79]That's not because I just saw cheese on a plate.
[249:16.35]I thought these were hot dogs.
[249:18.34]I was gonna say, why are they hot dogs in medieval times?
[249:28.14]Wait, I can sleep.
[249:31.33]Do I have a level up yet or no?
[249:43.16]we've done it I can't believe it I didn't really think this would work they probably were medieval hot dogs you know that's true check your sigil stone yes we're not done not even close this was only the first step if this town is to be ours again we'll need to get inside the castle you've come this far with us
[250:04.89]Will you go further?
[250:06.80]If we're truly going to succeed, I'll need much more of your help.
[250:11.20]I warn you, though, what we've seen so far is nothing compared to the battle that likely awaits us.
[250:17.65]Take a few moments to catch your breath and think it over.
[250:19.93]How come you always think about how things smell?
[250:21.57]Because I'm a sensory person.
[250:23.10]I'm about sensory.
[250:25.50]Smells.
[250:26.96]What something tastes like, the smell, the audio.
[250:33.31]when I've taken my fingertips and just sliding it across this wood here.
[250:39.46]Just sliding across the wood feel.
[250:56.10]You would love cocomelon?
[250:58.02]No, I would not.
[251:00.52]That is for babies, and I am a grown man.
[251:14.54]uh where oh I need a key to get in here I I don't get it I'm done are you ready to go we need your help getting I knew you'd be up to it our goal is the castle gate we should be able to use this door to get out to the plaza in front of the castle gatehouse
[251:43.48]You know the drill stick close and keep your eyes.
[251:49.09]Let's go.
[251:58.18]Be careful, I don't want to lose anybody.
[252:00.34]Good swing.
[252:04.71]Hey, let me take this one.
[252:14.36]Damn it!
[252:15.24]This is no good!
[252:17.06]The gates are locked, and the only way to open them is from within the gatehouse.
[252:21.59]Shit.
[252:24.66]He should be around the camp somewhere.
[252:26.79]He was with the survivors we rescued from the Chapel of Akatosh.
[252:30.52]Is the food any good?
[252:31.97]We can't open that gate from out here.
[252:34.09]The only mechanism for raising it is inside the gatehouse.
[252:37.19]And the only way to get into the gatehouse now would be through the passage at the north guardhouse.
[252:42.72]But that's always kept locked.
[252:44.78]Hurry and find Barrage Indian.
[252:47.00]He should be back in the chapel.
[252:49.49]And once you've got it, get to the guardhouse.
[252:53.93]Where you at?
[252:54.53]Back here?
[252:56.92]I'm going to take another break here in about one minute.
[253:01.29]And we can pick it right back up.
[253:07.61]Are you playing on easy?
[253:09.56]I'm playing on I believe what?
[253:12.98]What's the middle one?
[253:14.08]Should I play on the harder difficulty?
[253:20.51]Is it better?
[253:23.47]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[253:33.55]Yes, I have it.
[253:34.83]Why?
[253:35.51]It's really unbalanced.
[253:39.02]You do the guard one little favor and suddenly you think you're Marius' best friend.
[253:44.56]You probably couldn't find it on your own.
[253:46.19]I'll be right back.
[253:47.37]See you guys in a few minutes.
[253:48.75]And we will go save the prince or whoever's in there.
[253:51.97]I've still got some fight left in me.
[253:55.56]What is he doing?
[253:57.72]Wait, I missed a little bit of that.
[254:00.02]Does he not want to give me the key?
[254:07.88]Okay, well, I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[254:12.25]BRB.
[254:14.87]Where's the difficulty?
[254:21.69]Okay, I'm on Adept.
[254:26.60]If you need to know.
[254:35.01]Adapt is good?
[254:35.76]Okay.
[254:36.53]Alright, I'll be right back.
[254:37.74]See you in a few minutes.
[259:46.15]Thank you.
[261:46.66]Sorry about that.
[261:47.28]It took a little longer.
[261:48.20]I had to make tea.
[261:55.75]What are we working with here?
[262:04.37]Alright, I gotta check the stone.
[262:07.05]See what that is.
[262:20.37]What does it do?
[262:25.34]Silence on strike resists magic on self.
[262:30.09]I can put it on a ring.
[262:36.03]Should I save these for when I get something actually worth it?
[262:41.38]Don't just put it on a regular longsword, I would imagine.
[262:54.34]These are both great.
[262:59.07]You'll get much better stones at higher levels.
[263:01.09]Um, so should I just do this one?
[263:07.00]The low tier one anyway, just use it.
[263:09.16]Because this magic will be good.
[263:13.46]I think that's just 5% less damage from magic.
[263:23.26]I'll do it.
[263:24.90]On a... Should I put it on my stupid green dog shit?
[263:40.30]Let's do it.
[263:42.70]Well, ring is actually way more practical, yeah.
[263:47.38]Can I put it on a... Does it matter?
[263:49.21]Brass ring?
[263:49.99]Just put it on the brass ring?
[263:50.85]Brass topaz ring?
[263:51.79]What's the difference?
[263:57.69]Is there a difference?
[264:06.86]Just any ring?
[264:11.15]I'll put it on this one.
[264:14.89]Alright, enchant this.
[264:15.79]A valid name for this enchantment?
[264:26.06]What?
[264:28.69]What the hell is happening?
[264:41.10]Oh.
[264:55.58]Okay.
[265:04.52]Name is too long.
[265:22.69]I don't fucking care.
[265:24.60]Is it on?
[265:33.47]It actually is.
[265:35.62]The ring of 5% resisting magic.
[265:39.04]You gotta be literal sometimes.
[265:43.04]This is worth 780 bucks.
[265:43.82]Cool.
[265:44.12]Alright.
[265:44.50]Hike!
[265:50.35]Ooh!
[266:04.05]Why are you screaming around the corner?
[266:05.49]Skeleton!
[266:33.77]Lightning.
[266:36.25]Enchanted swing!
[266:42.08]This thing is enchanted, isn't it?
[266:57.66]Where do we go now?
[267:15.94]Pondering increased to 40.
[267:20.34]What did he say?
[267:26.51]He fought mud crabs?
[267:36.95]He fought mud crabs better than me.
[267:56.96]I have too many things.
[268:00.69]Please remind me.
[268:02.51]Strength only.
[268:05.33]I am only putting points in strength.
[268:09.30]I'm not putting a point in anything else.
[268:11.12]This shit's gotta go.
[268:12.24]It's stolen anyways.
[268:17.57]How many rings can you have on?
[268:25.60]Detect life on self.
[268:30.53]What does that do?
[268:35.01]Oh, shit.
[268:35.59]Did they know that's stolen?
[268:39.70]I just threw down stolen goods.
[268:49.75]We killed this guy accidentally.
[268:53.40]I know it.
[269:04.75]Sell stuff.
[269:06.71]I know, I've been in this mission for an hour and a half.
[269:11.37]Trap door.
[269:14.06]Thank you.
[269:19.04]Battle for Castle Kvatch.
[269:35.09]I need to fall into the gatehouse so I can raise the gates and let the guards in the castle courtyard.
[269:38.44]Let's go.
[269:39.81]I do have buddies with me, though.
[270:02.53]you check the sigil stone I did I put it on it's the ring of magic resistance let's go raise the gates I must now help fablian and his men defeat the monsters within
[270:32.67]There's a lot of people here.
[270:34.83]I feel like I'm.
[270:36.57]This is dangerous to start swinging.
[270:39.96]I don't know if I want to.
[270:40.60]Are we winning?
[270:57.94]Damn you.
[271:09.71]We're good.
[271:16.86]Nice chop!
[271:18.58]Continue the onslaught.
[271:32.59]We won.
[271:42.53]He doesn't do anything?
[271:43.69]Do I just go in?
[271:51.19]Dude looks like Loki.
[271:52.57]Okay.
[271:53.39]Alright, I'm... Getting fucking sick and tired of that.
[271:57.35]So, mods, if you start seeing people say that again, like, it's just very clearly not even close.
[272:02.52]Just start timing people out, because it's starting to get really fucking irritating to me.
[272:05.90]Like, I made this custom character the way that I wanted to make it.
[272:10.71]And I love the color green, I love gold, and I don't even see any similarities at all.
[272:14.65]So, it's just getting...
[272:16.75]It's just fucking getting tiring for me.
[272:18.76]So, this is a custom character that I, this is my custom character.
[272:24.31]I don't even, never even seen, I don't even know what Loki is.
[272:31.38]It doesn't, it doesn't bother me, but it's just starting to fucking piss me off a little.
[272:37.53]Imagine you spent like 30 to 40 minutes making a character or like an hour or two writing a whole backstory over the course of a week or so and people come in and say, oh, look, it's Loki.
[272:47.34]Like, I don't fucking know what that is.
[272:49.89]Leave me the fuck alone.
[273:09.49]Is this disrespectful?
[273:11.31]Probably.
[273:11.87]I can't get out.
[273:17.47]I actually stuck.
[273:22.27]Okay, I was stuck in the chair.
[273:39.10]Did I do that?
[273:49.88]My blades are better for me now.
[273:52.34]Well, I'm taking a bunch of his stuff.
[274:06.98]This stuff is worth so much money.
[274:22.88]No, not the same.
[274:27.64]You know what would make this character great?
[274:28.88]A big staff.
[274:30.57]I really need a big staff.
[274:35.03]It's very important.
[274:42.68]And I need to be able to travel through time.
[274:49.63]What can I throw away?
[274:53.89]Eh, shit.
[274:55.62]I can't carry this.
[275:05.33]It's worth a lot of money.
[275:08.32]This helmet's worth a lot of money too.
[275:11.84]Eh.
[275:15.39]Eh.
[275:23.80]He had a lot of food.
[275:30.64]I have so... I gotta sell these potions.
[275:32.20]I have so many.
[275:33.02]I've got an entire winery down here.
[275:50.10]Damn it.
[275:51.54]Am I really gonna get rid of this?
[275:52.60]Fine.
[275:54.83]Still?
[275:55.65]These are heavy.
[276:11.41]Okay, let's go.
[276:19.05]This is a regular scamp.
[276:20.11]This is not a scurvy scamp.
[276:22.59]Whatever the hell his name is.
[276:38.86]Nice.
[276:47.21]Okay.
[276:58.21]Nothing better than a roaring fire.
[277:04.18]Alright, what element do you think that you are?
[277:08.19]Type it, type it, go.
[277:09.95]Don't think about it, just do it.
[277:11.29]What element are you?
[277:12.28]Type it.
[277:13.72]Stop thinking about it.
[277:14.86]Stop thinking about it, stop.
[277:18.36]Oh, no, no, no, wait, uh, do, uh, Moz, do a poll.
[277:21.35]Fire, water, Earth, air.
[277:26.40]Go.
[277:27.16]What do you think, not what, like, your birth sign is, whatever, what do you think you are?
[277:33.02]Fire, water, air, Earth.
[277:40.28]Do it.
[277:40.58]Don't think about it.
[277:41.24]Click it.
[277:42.18]Just use your gut.
[277:42.80]Go with the flow.
[277:43.32]Let me see what we got here.
[277:58.45]Lots of water, lots of Earth, air, heart?
[278:02.34]I didn't say heart.
[278:14.60]You know what the most important stat is?
[278:19.08]Constitution.
[278:26.75]Constitution.
[278:28.26]Fortitude and Constitution.
[278:29.36]They've been both the same.
[278:30.58]Effectively.
[278:31.48]I think that's the most important step.
[278:33.68]It's not strength.
[278:35.22]It's not agility.
[278:37.21]It's not magic.
[278:38.17]It's not intelligence.
[278:39.45]No.
[278:40.09]It is Constitution.
[278:46.76]Fortitude is the most important thing you could ever have.
[278:51.51]Not charisma.
[278:52.53]No.
[278:53.31]Constitution.
[278:58.02]Constitution's not going to help you dodge a battleaxe.
[279:06.54]No, but when you get hit by it, you'll be able to deal with it.
[279:11.26]You'll find a way to deal with it.
[279:13.89]When you get hit.
[279:16.01]Even if you dodge it.
[279:19.90]Get that, get that fucking fortitude stat up.
[279:23.16]Fortitude.
[279:23.76]Fortitude.
[279:25.29]Oh, I don't want to cast spells.
[279:27.34]Fuck up.
[279:28.36]Fortitude.
[279:29.20]Constitution.
[279:34.86]Where do I go?
[279:35.42]There's a body on the ground I didn't loot?
[279:47.03]Stop making up stuff.
[279:48.76]Constitution?
[279:49.82]What are you talking about?
[279:56.34]Not Ormelius!
[280:00.81]Count Goldwine.
[280:06.54]Holy shit, he's got a lot of stuff.
[280:14.18]Do you feel bad about sitting in his chair now?
[280:17.05]Nah.
[280:17.99]Not really.
[280:30.01]Hi Jeremy, your feel-like printer today, thanks.
[280:35.52]Oh, okay.
[280:35.72]Thank you.
[280:52.80]Will.
[280:54.14]Not intelligence, it's will.
[280:56.98]Fortitude.
[280:57.94]Will.
[280:58.64]Constitution.
[281:01.30]What about me picking up a big two-handed thunder hammer?
[281:05.78]Constitution.
[281:07.09]Will.
[281:08.07]Orditude.
[281:18.97]I'm on your side!
[281:20.25]Where is the Count?
[281:21.66]Why is he not with you?
[281:24.63]I'm sorry.
[281:25.94]Didn't make it.
[281:26.56]Wait, is it any good?
[281:30.90]It looked like it could have been good.
[281:51.41]Is lying bad here?
[281:58.08]He died because he didn't have constitution, fortitude, will.
[282:04.39]Maybe.
[282:07.56]Do I have to give it to him?
[282:12.89]Bro.
[282:18.92]Bro.
[282:22.28]Yeah, I, um... Oh!
[282:34.24]Looks like I found it in my pocket.
[282:36.66]I must have misplaced it with a few things.
[282:38.49]Here it is.
[282:39.78]I must have been in a bunch of other stuff.
[282:53.17]Did he just give me his clothes?
[283:07.15]I just threw one of these on the ground.
[283:12.16]that's not okay is it good oh wait this one's got fortify oh constitution fortitude will I told you that's got strength on it dumb
[283:42.18]This isn't green robes though.
[283:43.83]I don't want this.
[283:46.80]Determination?
[283:47.46]No, determination is not constitution.
[283:51.09]Determination is not constitution.
[284:14.31]You look like a Muppet.
[284:16.57]Determination is wisdom.
[284:19.20]Now, determination is your ability to... We're not talking about Undertale right now.
[284:24.84]It's a great game, but... We're talking about courage in pain or adversity.
[284:40.68]Your ability to endure.
[284:44.30]The ability to endure?
[284:48.46]I'm out.
[285:01.44]Acrobatic.
[285:02.71]Mesmerizing.
[285:03.89]Magician.
[285:08.86]Hey, thanks.
[285:10.44]No!
[285:14.50]I fucked up.
[285:15.77]I fucked up.
[285:16.45]I fucked up.
[285:17.05]I fucked up.
[285:17.55]I fucked up.
[285:18.21]I fucked up.
[285:18.89]I fucked up.
[285:19.63]I fucked up.
[285:22.42]That was the last straw.
[285:36.08]Alright, we're fine.
[285:50.16]He's dead.
[285:51.70]Yes, we.
[285:54.37]We, he's dead.
[285:59.42]Here's the ring.
[286:01.04]Alright, goodbye.
[286:19.83]Why are you all sparkly?
[286:23.39]Oh, I know why.
[286:23.99]That must be the... and the... and the... Clean this up.
[286:43.29]I have to just fast travel and sell.
[286:44.77]I'm not throwing stuff on the ground.
[286:48.55]What mythical beasts would you eat?
[286:49.73]None of them.
[286:50.31]I would get diarrhea for probably six or seven years.
[287:01.11]Have I been here?
[287:06.25]Anvil?
[287:08.88]Ah, you can't fast travel when you have too much shit on.
[287:12.60]Game is fucking dog shit.
[287:14.25]Really?
[287:15.81]You can't fast travel whenever you want?
[287:19.51]Somebody gave this game of the year or something, like 20 years ago?
[287:23.80]Give me a fucking break.
[287:27.77]I can't fast travel.
[287:31.01]Oh, yikes.

[289:31.46]So... ...choose wisely.
[289:33.99]What element am I?

[289:44.88]No, it's about... ...fortitude.

[290:35.03]I need to wait till morning.
[290:39.43]Alright, what do we got so far?
[290:43.68]That's a lot of wind.
[290:45.40]Really?
[290:45.74]Is it because I said the stupid thing where I said I could fly?
[290:50.03]Really?
[290:50.27]You think I'm wind?
[290:51.33]Maybe I am.
[290:55.96]You guys think I'm air?
[290:58.64]Explain.
[290:59.94]You aren't wind.
[291:03.41]Greetings, Argonian.
[291:11.44]Because you're an airhead.
[291:15.69]That's way too many people.
[291:18.23]I feel like that was botted.
[291:19.42]That's how ridiculous I think that is.
[291:24.22]You're fickle and change your mind constantly.
[291:29.23]Yeah.
[291:30.37]What else?
[291:34.86]You're always talking about lightning.
[291:38.48]You're all over the place.
[291:39.46]You're all over the place.
[291:41.06]I just said that.
[291:41.98]I'm making up somebody's chat.
[291:47.47]You look like a douche.
[291:50.11]How does that make me an air sign?
[291:51.79]I would like you to explain that a little bit more.
[291:54.53]I look like a douchebag.
[291:56.21]So, therefore, I am an air sign.
[291:59.60]Or a wind or something.
[292:00.80]Explain that.
[292:05.72]I just don't get it.
[292:06.50]I mean, I would love to hear you elaborate.
[292:10.88]You're fast.
[292:12.76]Not anymore.
[292:13.24]He's an Earth sign.
[292:16.20]He's an Earth sign.
[292:22.67]Look at a blacksmith in this fucking piece of shit town, by the way.
[292:25.75]Finally.
[292:31.20]You remind me of my homeland during the blight.
[292:48.68]If you'll excuse me, I'm Arvida Bayless.
[292:51.86]They call me... Uh, you don't do that to an air sign and fucking walk away.
[292:55.35]We gotta talk.
[292:59.21]Say what you're going to say.
[293:10.11]What a great story.

[295:10.45]What's going on with you?
[295:12.05]Hi.
[295:34.15]I'm Wilbur, owner and proprietor of the Count's Arms.
[295:37.54]We make beds and food available to guests.
[295:40.10]Can I help you?
[295:42.68]Why did he do that?
[295:43.74]The prophet speaks truth.
[295:45.17]Why did he do that?
[295:46.03]That was so mean.
[295:46.85]This is the start of something terrible.
[295:48.49]He started the conversation.
[295:49.73]He walked up and started talking, didn't he?
[295:55.26]So, we understand each other perfectly.
[296:02.32]That's amazing.
[296:04.82]Good one.
[296:07.24]Don't waste your flattery on me.

[297:04.74]I thought this was the blacksmith.
[297:06.08]Where the fuck am I?
[297:11.29]What's the name of this place?
[297:12.49]Isn't this place called the Anvil of Steel?
[297:15.28]What is this place?
[297:17.72]Is this a bar?
[297:22.75]Bro, you're at the restaurant.
[297:23.97]Why is the restaurant called this?
[297:35.17]The Count's Arms.
[297:39.75]That's a blacksmith's name if I've ever heard it.
[297:42.11]The Count's Arms?
[297:47.64]Oh, I'm sorry guys, the place isn't called Pepper and Onions, like every inn from the fucking 1200s was.
[297:56.43]Paul, you're in Pepper and Onions.
[297:58.79]Not the Count's Arms.
[298:03.15]I just wasted another hundred gold.
[298:13.61]It's the in logo on the sign.
[298:16.77]I don't know.
[298:17.05]I thought that was just somebody.
[298:17.91]I didn't know they had a logo.
[298:19.43]Where's the blacksmith?
[298:27.91]Down here.
[298:29.95]Big church is the blacksmith.
[298:34.64]You're right next to it.
[298:36.44]I don't see a sign.
[298:42.99]closest to the front gate it's like over here whoa alright let me guess which one of these is a blacksmith the potty house I don't think that's the right one the count's arms oh sounds like a place I can click
[299:18.09]The Gold Coast.
[299:19.27]It's probably that.
[299:22.21]No.
[299:24.35]Is it the barracks?
[299:34.15]The Peacemakers.
[299:36.61]To me, that's like we're going to hang out and make peace.
[299:47.92]We're gonna go share a brew and hang out and talk.
[299:52.21]Not the Count's Arms.
[299:59.14]Is it right there?
[299:59.70]Did I walk by it?
[300:15.66]Oh, it is right there.
[300:21.05]Well, I have to walk because I don't want to throw anything on the ground.
[300:29.32]Okay.
[300:30.52]I have to tell you.
[300:31.62]I'm sorry, guys.
[300:32.58]I thought that was a protractor.
[300:34.63]I thought this was a map maker.
[300:35.97]I thought this was an Adventurer's Guild thing.
[300:38.47]That looks like a compass protractor thing.
[300:41.58]I didn't think that was an anvil.
[300:43.50]I thought that was a compass.
[300:45.08]Draw a circle on a map and find the treasure.
[300:48.19]At the Peacemaker's.
[300:54.36]Oh wait, do you like me?
[301:03.55]Yeah, I get it.
[301:10.31]Yes, yes, whatever you say.
[301:13.58]Not now, not- I doubt it.
[301:17.38]I doubt it.
[301:18.68]Don't waste your flatter- Don't, please, I'm so- Sure, that's cute.
[301:23.06]Okay, we're good now.
[301:27.23]One more.
[301:28.07]Okay, we're good.
[301:36.12]We're cool.
[301:41.19]Now.
[301:42.97]There we go.
[301:45.45]How about...
[301:53.56]Give me 60% of the value of this stuff.
[301:59.10]Take this.
[301:59.46]55.
[302:00.39]55%.
[302:04.03]I won't go a dollar lower.
[302:07.94]Alright.
[302:13.33]Time to sell a ton of stuff.
[302:16.97]Your age is showing.
[302:20.30]I don't, whatever.
[302:21.10]I don't care.
[302:23.11]I'm getting older.
[302:24.25]Do you think I care?
[302:24.99]I don't care.
[302:39.07]An excellent bargain.
[302:49.51]A fine transaction.
[302:55.52]That's a fair deal.
[303:01.07]Should I just wait till these are worth way more?
[303:04.37]Is it worth doing it now?
[303:11.22]Should I wait till these are more like seven, eight hundred?
[303:16.55]Keep them?
[303:16.77]Okay.
[303:20.02]um still this is still too much shit I'm gonna get rid of a lot of other stuff though let me see maybe the greaves these are expensive and they only two defense the right one
[303:47.50]Get rid of these.
[303:50.26]Get rid of these.
[303:54.42]I'm going to keep this because it's just great and it's expensive.
[304:02.43]Anything else I should keep or get rid of?
[304:13.94]What's my character's backstory?
[304:15.38]I wrote it a while ago.
[304:25.57]So effectively, I wrote it like a week ago, but it's he's the son of Luffy, the king of the frost giants.
[304:34.14]I think I think that frost giant stuff is cool.
[304:37.26]And he was adopted by a god that is super powerful and can shoot lightning bolts.
[304:43.65]But that's not has nothing to do with this character or anything.
[304:47.04]It's just like more extended universe stuff that I thought was fun.
[304:52.02]He's a prince.
[304:54.89]His true heritage is a frost giant, though.
[304:58.06]So he's mostly a frost giant.
[305:03.12]But that kind of led to a lot of conflict with his brother, because this is his half-brother.
[305:17.94]He's kind of jealous.
[305:22.92]We're all laughing.
[305:26.13]another satisfied customer everybody's talking about the prophet after the attack on the chapel people are inclined to believe almost anything somebody said I don't know how to pronounce this lock locky I don't know where he came from just appeared outside the chapel a day or so after the I hate this but I'm gonna keep doing it I hate it more than anything
[305:54.38]been here 30 years and I expect I'll last another tennis home when I'm gone god's willing my apprentice enelroth will tend the smithy okay what meat do you think you are let's get a poll up here uh what meat do you think I am beef chicken turkey fish what kind of meat do you think I am
[306:19.15]Meat, beef, chicken, turkey, fish, bison, or mutton.
[306:27.62]Which one?
[306:29.60]Huge personality differences between them.
[306:34.91]What about shellfish?
[306:42.80]That's not one of the main personality meats.
[306:46.07]It's part of fish, I'd say.
[306:51.35]I can repair almost anything.
[307:02.58]Turkey?
[307:04.64]I could see that.
[307:05.16]Turkeys are stalwart.
[307:06.89]They have tons of constitution.
[307:08.99]They fly only when they need to.
[307:10.75]They don't give a shit.
[307:14.20]They only, in very extreme circumstances, a turkey will fly.
[307:18.54]They're strong.
[307:21.08]They're incredibly regal.
[307:23.75]They actually should have been the national bird of the United States.
[307:31.62]That's Ben Franklin that wanted it to be the turkey.
[307:34.62]Which would have been great.
[307:40.13]Put a tally mark on the other thing.
[307:42.03]One on that chalkboard of Ben Franklin creating more fucking awesome shit.
[307:47.12]Okay.
[307:52.33]He wants eagles to be extinct.
[307:54.00]No, I've... No.
[307:58.18]Ben Franklin, inventor of the turkey.
[308:00.15]Yeah.
[308:02.63]Take care.
[308:06.68]Oh, you got a pizza oven?
[308:07.66]That's awesome!
[308:11.58]Alright, if I ever had a hundred million dollars... I would have a giant, crazy pizza oven like this.
[308:19.34]That would be up there.
[308:21.44]Okay, you know that that show, that insane pool show that we talked about a couple days ago?
[308:25.51]My insane pool would be a like $700,000 fucking stone brick or something, something from like the 1100s oven.
[308:36.52]Like this.
[308:39.14]I would have a coal oven, even though you don't think you can even have them.
[308:46.01]I don't want a giant grotto pool.
[308:47.95]I want a huge $400,000 pizza oven.
[308:57.44]Good afternoon.
[308:59.10]And I want to get that big spatula.
[309:01.64]You just... You pull it out.
[309:05.01]You put it in.
[309:05.37]You pull it out.
[309:05.75]You put it in.
[309:06.57]Flip it.
[309:06.85]Flip it.
[309:07.25]So in one minute, you have a perfect, crispy, amazing pizza.
[309:16.92]I want to invite people.
[309:17.70]I want to have big pizza parties where people come over and I have that big apron on and I'm just making them.
[309:23.75]Hello.
[309:28.08]My friend has that.
[309:29.21]It's amazing.
[309:30.03]What?
[309:31.83]Your friend has a $400,000 coal pizza oven?
[309:37.84]I don't think they cost that much, but... Only an apron.
[309:43.47]Are you on cocaine right now?
[309:45.13]No!
[309:50.64]They're not that expensive.
[309:53.73]Yeah, but to put it in your house it would be.
[309:55.46]That would be... I don't know about that.
[309:57.76]To have a section of your house be a gigantic pizza oven room.
[310:03.73]I don't think that's like $2,000.
[310:08.97]You'd have to convert a whole room in your house into a restaurant.
[310:13.12]It's probably illegal.
[310:16.68]Yeah.
[310:20.09]I tried to punch him what do I owe this honor I am but a humble prophet what business do you have with me you did you take a hit of acid no I didn't I asked I said I want a pizza oven apparently that makes me like a coke head
[310:42.65]Oh, I want a big cool pizza oven and have pizza parties with my friends.
[310:46.96]He must be on coke.
[310:48.58]He's probably taking fucking LSD and crack.
[310:52.63]Why is that so abnormal?
[310:56.75]This is only the beginning.
[311:00.11]Umaril has returned as foretold by Pelinal Whitestrake in his dying breath.
[311:11.17]Yeah, I did say $400,000, which is, I will admit, that's way too high.
[311:17.04]I really highballed that.
[311:19.38]If I had a contractor come over, they're like, so what do you want to do?
[311:22.84]Well, I'm going to give you $400,000 to make a pizza oven.
[311:25.41]They'd be like, oh, okay.
[311:29.11]Wait, a pizza oven?
[311:30.55]You just want a pizza oven?
[311:31.71]Yeah, yeah, just a pizza oven.
[311:34.02]Oh my God, a pizza oven that comes out of the wall right here?
[311:37.78]Yeah, yeah, just have it stick out and make it out of stone.
[311:45.83]Why is he puking?
[311:53.64]Because that's so crazy.
[311:54.82]And he's realizing that he's going to get 350,000 extra dollars.
[311:58.17]And he's like, this guy's fucking stupid.
[312:02.03]Yeah, and I cover my hands and my eyes and I go, I don't want to see the bill.
[312:06.66]I don't want to see the bill.
[312:07.40]I don't want to see the bill.
[312:08.54]Just take it.
[312:09.10]I don't want to see the bill.
[312:15.75]And he has now returned.
[312:22.88]So when are you going to get that pizza oven?
[312:30.41]I'm taking another break.
[312:32.29]This is probably the last break of the night, too.
[312:35.61]Why are you writing the price to the contractor?
[312:37.73]I don't know in this stupid, shitty scenario.
[312:40.48]I don't... We're in fantasy imagination land right now.
[312:44.24]None of this even is real.
[312:46.65]you understand nothing the blood speaks I can read the ancient runes if you can be like 10 to 15 what is that uh arrested development joke about like how much is it 50 is it a banana right god shall be cast down a curse upon
[313:15.07]How much even is a banana?
[313:16.47]Ten dollars?
[313:17.31]Something like that?
[313:17.97]It's one banana, Michael.
[313:23.10]How much could it cost?
[313:24.40]Ten dollars?
[313:27.93]That's a great show.
[313:28.87]Especially the early seasons.
[313:36.40]Alas.
[313:38.14]Umaril cannot be stopped.
[313:41.16]What Arrested Development character are you?
[313:47.73]Oh, I don't know.
[313:49.69]I don't know.
[313:52.52]God?
[313:53.52]No, maybe.
[313:54.70]No.
[314:02.35]One of the best jokes in that whole show is the suit one.
[314:07.60]He's like, how am I supposed to do this?
[314:09.80]I got a $2,000 suit on.
[314:11.24]Michael, what am I supposed to do?
[314:12.68]I don't want to dust up my $2,000 suit.
[314:16.65]Like 15 minutes later, he keeps increasing how much it costed.
[314:21.29]It's a $5,000 suit, Michael.
[314:23.09]Come on.
[314:24.51]You expect me to do that in a $5,000 suit?
[314:28.86]Come on.
[314:30.72]You would quest for the holy panoply of... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[314:35.60]A guy in a $6,000 suit is going to do that.
[314:39.03]I've been talking to this guy for too long.
[314:41.81]I'm done with this guy.
[314:45.33]I'm the hero of Kvatch.
[314:46.64]You never heard of me?
[314:51.40]Let me add one more voice to the never-ending chorus of praise.
[314:58.26]As I'm going to start here, I'm going to take a last break.
[315:04.99]See you guys in a few minutes, and we will keep going.
[315:07.31]Probably the last break of the night.
[315:09.75]I don't know how much longer I'm going to play, but we'll be back tomorrow.
[315:12.70]I told you it was going to be Oblivion weekend, and I meant it.
[315:16.46]Oh, they're there.
[315:18.15]I'll be right back.
[319:03.54]I hope the next Elder Scrolls game is a team based extraction shooter.
[319:22.14]Go to bed.
[319:26.67]Actually, though, I really love Dark and Darker.
[319:35.00]And I know that they're doing a PvE-only mode or something, right?
[319:50.43]That's what I heard.
[319:55.46]I like the very brutally scary, hard, difficult medieval fantasy setting.
[320:06.17]But, and I like, oh, you gotta bring loot.
[320:10.80]The extraction kind of, I call it, this guy is, he's just ranting at me while I'm trying to, I'm trying to do my own rant.
[320:19.31]We can't have two going on at the same time.
[320:20.73]The Crusader's relics have been lost for many an age.
[320:25.69]Who now can succeed in the quest for the relics where the greatest knights of legend all fail?
[320:35.92]Okay.
[320:37.90]I'll be back.
[320:38.59]What I was going to say is I love the genre.
[320:44.11]I love the medieval fantasy genre.
[320:47.98]But I do feel like a lot of it is...
[320:51.89]compass at the top uh you gotta prepare there's quests there's quest markers and go do it I like the genre being played with a little bit more uh medieval fantasy I think there's tons of other things you can mess around with it is he following me
[321:18.69]But the idea of an extraction type game in a medieval setting I think is great.
[321:24.36]There's so much type of loot.
[321:25.68]There's so many different kinds of loot you can pull out.
[321:32.54]Okay, if there was a game where it had Diablo and Path of Exile style uniques...
[321:40.00]In a very brutally difficult action.
[321:44.43]Doesn't matter if it's first person or third person.
[321:46.29]I would prefer it to be probably first in that setting.
[321:49.75]Dark and Dark are kind of alike, but it's only PvE and you play it with friends.
[321:54.46]There could be a PvP mode that you do, but I think that that's so much more fun divvying up loot with friends and not worrying about somebody killing you and taking everything.
[322:14.73]The original D&D was a loot extraction game.
[322:19.14]The Nightreign.
[322:20.02]I mean, we don't know what Nightreign exactly is going to be.
[322:22.22]It's probably going to be kind of like that.
[322:25.26]But I don't know how much loot... I'm a loot weirdo.
[322:29.27]Give me the D2 EOE style uniques.
[322:33.67]Not randomly rolled legendaries.
[322:36.33]I don't want that shit.
[322:37.87]I want Diablo II uniques.
[322:41.06]Hundreds of them.
[322:42.34]I don't care if they suck.
[322:43.84]They could be weird.
[322:44.62]They could be... Like PoE does this.
[322:46.56]They could be weirdo build stuff.
[322:48.03]I just want it.
[322:48.83]I almost punched you.
[322:52.59]Nightreign won't have weapons you get to keep.
[322:56.60]Play Borderlands?
[322:57.54]No, I don't want to play Borderlands.
[322:59.32]I don't want to get to the one and a half hour mark in Borderlands and just press Q and unload on everything and kill everything in one second.
[323:08.31]I don't want to do that.
[323:09.67]I want to... No.
[323:10.41]No.
[323:15.63]Alright, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[323:19.32]Find the air.
[323:19.86]Okay, this is what I was doing.
[323:23.91]Barricade itself within the chapel.
[323:27.62]Wait, what am I doing here?
[323:33.41]He's still stuck in the castle.
[323:49.30]we good wait I heard about how you helped the guard drive the daedra back well done ah alright um I have to find you the emperor is dead who are you what do you really want with me
[324:07.76]You're Martin, right?
[324:08.70]The priest?
[324:09.28]Yes.
[324:10.16]I'm a priest.
[324:11.79]Do you need a priest?
[324:13.89]I don't think I'll be much help to you.
[324:16.31]I'm having trouble understanding the gods right now.
[324:19.42]If all this is part of a divine plan, I'm not sure I want to have anything to do with it.
[324:31.22]also not we need your help you came to me for help you're more of a fool than you look look around what good is a priest you have heal you have greater heal you have redo you have resurrection you have lots of good stuff you think the emperor is my father no you must have the wrong man I am a priest of Akatosh my father was a farmer okay
[324:58.08]You spoke to the Emperor before he died?
[325:00.70]And he told you to find me?
[325:04.29]I don't know.
[325:05.65]It's strange.
[325:06.49]I think you might actually be telling the truth.
[325:10.40]What does this mean?
[325:11.48]What do you want from me?
[325:14.76]You destroyed the Oblivion Gate, they say.
[325:16.88]You gave them hope.
[325:18.51]You helped them drive the Daedra back.
[325:20.95]Yes, I'll come with you to Wayne and Priory and hear what Joffrey has to say.
[325:27.94]Why is everybody doing this?
[325:32.79]It's very distracting.
[325:34.59]What is making everybody have sparkly pink flowers all over them?
[325:40.96]Take off the detect ring.
[325:46.47]Everybody shut up!
[325:48.19]Shut up!
[325:51.85]Quiet!

[326:45.64]No, we were gonna go... We'll go in there after this.

[327:10.63]You can put the axe down.
[327:12.49]You do this intimidation shit and it pisses people off.
[327:15.36]And people get uncomfortable.
[327:16.56]I know you're a skeleton that's already a little bit off-putting.
[327:19.41]There's priests everywhere.
[327:21.15]Bro, get out of my face, alright?
[327:23.17]Get out of my face.
[327:24.07]Get the fuck out of my face.

[327:29.82]It's fine.
[327:30.20]Bro, get the fuck out of my face.
[327:38.23]Wait, when was the last time I actually saved it?
[327:43.79]Oh, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
[327:53.50]Follow me or wait here?
[327:55.21]Okay.

[328:07.30]he's a follower of yours now I can't stop thinking that's sick I know what you're talking about it's a smell really smoke and fire and something worse in the ruins
[328:44.27]Let this happen.

[329:03.33]Level five.
[329:04.07]Let's go.
[329:04.57]Strength.
[329:15.80]Okay, so now let's go back.
[329:17.06]Let's complete the quest.
[329:29.12]Come with me.
[329:30.66]Alright, follow me.
[329:37.03]Completing the quest.
[329:38.03]It's the smell really.
[329:39.65]Smoke and fire.
[329:40.73]I'm just lucky to be alive.
[329:42.69]Don't forget.
[329:44.01]Cameron, you set for Burr and Kvatch too.
[329:46.22]Kvatch was rebuilt from ruins months before.
[329:49.20]Can I just fast travel there?
[329:52.44]That was a ways away.
[330:02.92]Too many voices.
[330:03.62]Yeah.
[330:06.54]Okay.
[330:07.14]Here we go.
[330:10.19]What the fuck?
[330:12.25]Why is this always happening to everybody?
[330:16.78]Every town we go to, everyone was being killed.
[330:18.68]Okay.
[330:20.54]They are right... There's somebody right here.
[330:26.37]Who is attacking?
[330:28.14]I was in the sheepfold when they attacked.
[330:30.52]I heard the prior talking to someone.
[330:33.01]Looked around the corner to see who it was.
[330:35.73]They looked like travelers.
[330:37.31]Ordinary.
[330:38.57]Suddenly weapons appeared in their hands and they cut the prior down before he could move.
[330:43.74]Shit.
[330:43.86]They saw me watching and I ran.
[330:47.90]Where's Joffrey?
[330:50.05]You alright?
[330:50.31]I don't know.
[330:51.27]In the chapel praying, I think.
[330:53.01]You must help us.
[330:55.34]uh be good to put my weapon on alright we gotta fight here oh my God are you alright
[331:23.44]I don't know where... We just got here.
[331:38.00]Is that person okay?
[331:45.71]Oh, no.
[331:47.55]Nope.
[331:48.11]They didn't make it.
[331:59.35]I need starlight.
[332:00.25]It is dark.
[332:08.26]How you doing?
[332:08.75]You good?
[332:10.49]We have to check on, uh, Father Joffrey.
[332:13.67]No, I remember this guy!
[332:19.20]That's probably more Mubberl.
[332:33.50]Oh no.
[332:36.35]Don't do that.
[332:39.21]I took one clove of garlic.
[332:42.35]It's not a big deal.
[332:57.61]It's a sin.
[333:03.64]So where do they all run to?
[333:09.77]Oh, these are free now.
[333:16.90]Can you get on?
[333:21.92]What?
[333:22.14]Where do I go?
[333:22.64]I must find and protect Joffrey.
[333:33.12]He's not in there
[334:02.20]In here?
[334:03.12]Holy shit.
[334:03.74]I'm moving.
[334:05.98]Gallatin.
[334:08.47]Attack.
[334:26.69]Destruction mastery increased.
[334:30.06]Fire, frost, and lightning have flowed from your fingertips.
[334:31.92]You are now an apprentice in destruction and can cast apprentice-level destruction spells.
[334:36.41]Ooh, that means I can always do lightning explosion.
[334:39.57]The training of thousands has passed through me.
[334:42.96]You're back.
[334:44.20]There he is.
[334:45.20]He's safe.
[334:45.80]They attacked without warning.
[334:47.47]I was praying in the chapel when I heard Prior Maberel shout.
[334:50.59]I had just time to arm myself.
[334:52.79]The Amulet of Kings.
[334:54.62]I fear that was the target of this attack.
[334:56.84]I kept it in a secret room in weinon house we need to go see if it is safe either way we'll go together but I fear the worst repent your crimes he has a katana
[335:25.97]Does he have a katana?
[335:29.09]He does have a katana.
[335:43.95]No, no, it's been taken.
[335:48.29]Martin's with us.
[335:54.77]We gained Uriel's heir and lost the Amulet of Kings.
[335:58.52]Martin cannot stay here.
[336:00.26]We have driven them off, but they will be back once they learn of Martin's survival.
[336:04.38]Which they will.
[336:07.48]Okay.
[336:07.60]Where can we put Martin?
[336:08.32]Nowhere is truly safe against the power arrayed against us.
[336:11.01]But we must play for time, at least.
[336:13.81]Cloud Ruler Temple, I think.
[336:15.57]The hidden fortress of the Blades in the mountains near Bruma.
[336:18.95]A few men can hold it against an army.
[336:21.54]We should leave at once.
[336:25.15]oof there's a lot of info but do you just could you just could you do this in emotes you know like OMEGALULS and kappas and stuff like that's I just don't know if I don't got time for this you may as well take prime abril's horse from the stable he won't have use for it any longer
[336:51.13]Wait, what did he say?
[336:54.36]I can take the horse actually for real.
[336:57.30]Nice.
[336:57.58]Okay.
[336:59.05]Cloud Ruler Temple.
[337:00.21]You got it.
[337:01.29]Built a long time ago.
[337:03.13]Back in the day.
[337:04.83]In the mountains near Bruma.
[337:07.14]Okay.
[337:07.52]You got it.
[337:08.54]Let's go.
[337:08.94]Give me that horse.
[337:12.28]Okay.
[337:13.67]I'm going to save it right here.
[337:17.49]And I think that's a great place to stop.
[337:21.14]We'll pick this up tomorrow afternoon.
[337:22.92]I'm probably going to start a little bit earlier tomorrow, maybe.
[337:25.91]Instead of around 2, I'll maybe start... Meh, you know what?
[337:29.29]It'll happen at some point in the afternoon.
[337:35.36]This is fun, though.
[337:36.00]I played it a bit a few years ago, but... It does feel like a completely different game because of the remake.
[337:45.51]I'll see you guys tomorrow afternoon.
[337:49.66]And with that...
[337:51.45]We can go ahead and do this.
[337:54.47]Appreciate it.
[337:55.19]Thanks, guys.
[337:56.77]I'll see you tomorrow.
[337:58.39]More Oblivion.
[337:59.10]I will start with Oblivion.
[338:00.90]We may move to something else after three or four hours.
[338:05.20]Or maybe I'll just keep playing Oblivion.
