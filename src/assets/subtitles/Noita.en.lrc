[00:02.52]Oh my god.
[00:03.88]I can't even... I can't... I had to... Look, I sprinted out of here and took a piss as quick as I could.
[00:10.70]It's the fastest piss I've ever taken.
[00:12.52]I turned on the streaming button, and then I sprinted to the bathroom as fast as I could.
[00:18.42]I'm here now.
[00:19.30]Hi.
[00:22.42]How you doing?
[00:23.34]You good?
[00:25.22]I'm not... I'm just two minutes late.
[00:27.08]I'm sorry.
[00:30.18]I flip-flopped like crazy on the game today.
[00:33.42]I was going to play Spaceport Janitor, and then I found out that Noita has Twitch integration.
[00:37.81]It was going to be Noita.
[00:38.97]It was voted on.
[00:40.27]Noita lost.
[00:41.53]But then I voted, and it's worth a thousand votes.
[00:46.17]I freaked out, and I was like, holy shit, there's Twitch integration.
[00:47.87]I want to play it.
[00:48.29]And then somebody said, people can, like, hack you if you turn it on.
[00:50.31]I was like, I don't want to get hacked, so I turned it off.
[00:54.07]We're playing Noita today.
[01:02.52]One person was like, dude, don't turn on the Twitch integration.
[01:04.75]You're gonna get hacked.
[01:05.57]And I was like, what the fuck does that mean?
[01:08.95]They could have just been completely fucking with me, but you got me.
[01:13.25]I was like, oh, wow, Twitch integration.
[01:14.63]Maybe we'll do that instead.
[01:16.48]Oh, yeah, Pog.
[01:17.74]One person writes, hey, dude, just be careful.
[01:19.70]Like, you can get, like, your channel compromised with the Twitch integration.
[01:22.34]It's kind of buggy.
[01:23.66]Oh, that's all it took for me just to fucking not do it.
[01:29.20]So it's off!
[01:29.98]And now it was gonna play- But I wanna play the- It's 100% true.
[01:34.28]It's 100% not true.
[01:35.31]That's in no way true.
[01:36.63]God damn it!
[01:37.63]I knew- Look.
[01:39.77]This- This- Okay.
[01:40.79]This is within three minutes of me turning the stream on.
[01:45.71]Like, within four minutes of turning the stream on.
[01:48.79]I get a message that says, Dude, fucking be careful, man.
[01:50.98]I'm serious.
[01:51.54]That's not how you spell finish.
[01:56.36]Finish.
[02:00.46]Can everyone just put their hands up?
[02:01.98]Everybody just stand up?
[02:03.62]Just put your hands up!
[02:06.92]Is it still ro- I can- I'll fix it.
[02:10.57]Noita means witch in Finnish.
[02:12.31]It does!
[02:12.67]Uh, somebody gave a shitload of subs and money.
[02:16.63]Hold on.
[02:18.33]There you go, I fixed it.
[02:22.00]Uh, me- me- yaboo just gave 50 community subs.
[02:28.40]What are you doing?
[02:31.26]That's an absolute shitload of money.
[02:33.28]Thank you for the 50 community subs.
[02:38.85]That's me, you boo.
[02:45.78]Are you high today?
[02:46.68]No.
[02:47.46]Guys, I'm not high every day.
[02:49.28]Come on.
[02:49.84]I'm not...
[02:52.12]You know what?
[02:53.08]Yeah, I am.
[02:53.46]Because I get to say, I'm wicked high, and that's why all the things that I do that are stupid now have an excuse.
[03:00.71]So thank you for giving me a permanent excuse.
[03:04.83]Forever.
[03:06.77]I could fuck up a children's puzzle for an hour straight, and then everyone's like, what the fuck is going on?
[03:11.78]Is he okay?
[03:13.44]Yeah, sorry guys, uh.
[03:15.79]I just took a little bit of CBD this morning.
[03:18.09]And people would be like, oh, okay, yeah, like weed, 420 makes you like fucked up, I get it.
[03:22.09]Yeah, keep going, man.
[03:23.89]Keep going with this kid's puzzle.
[03:25.09]Maybe you'll get it eventually.
[03:27.79]Perfect.
[03:28.75]It works out perfectly for me.
[03:32.81]What do you mean I spelled it wrong again?
[03:36.75]F-I-N-I-S-H.
[03:39.95]Hold on.
[03:41.79]Finish.
[03:46.47]What?
[03:47.47]I had it right the first time.
[03:49.21]I had it right the first time.
[03:51.31]It's two N's.
[03:52.31]Those of you that were in pre-stream chat, it was two N's, wasn't it?
[03:55.39]I flipped it.
[04:02.39]I actually changed this.
[04:07.45]I had two N's and I changed it.
[04:12.83]You're already spelling a language wrong.
[04:18.17]But anyways, thank you for the 50 fucking subs.
[04:20.69]Thank you, SuperBruce, for the five community subs.
[04:22.61]And DestroyDude for five.
[04:23.83]Let's play Noita.
[04:24.63]You guys ready?
[04:25.77]That still makes you stupid.
[04:26.84]No, it doesn't, because I pressed the end on the keyboard wrong.
[04:33.68]Turn the sub sounds back on.
[04:35.70]You don't want that.
[04:36.82]Trust me.
[04:37.60]I don't want that.
[04:42.45]Oh, you don't.
[04:43.13]You really don't.
[04:43.79]Alright, I promise you guys one day, I will do a stream.
[04:49.93]That is subsounds on and TTS on too.
[04:54.09]I will just do a just annoy the stream stream.
[05:02.94]I'll do it for like a week.
[05:05.32]And then it's going off forever.
[05:08.22]Sellout stream.
[05:12.01]And it'll be randomized subsounds too.
[05:14.15]You'll never know what you're going to get.
[05:17.21]I will make sure that there's like 50 different subsounds I can play.
[05:22.09]So it's going to be fucked up.
[05:23.67]You're going to have no idea what's going to happen.
[05:26.00]I will record myself talking and saying just insane shit.
[05:30.70]I might do like a full two minute monologue for one of them.
[05:36.24]Notte is a rage game.
[05:37.76]Don't say that.
[05:38.34]Is it actually?
[05:40.48]Don't tell me that.
[05:44.67]Is Noito a rage game?
[05:47.74]Thank God the camera wasn't on.
[05:48.82]Because they would have just shown me.
[05:51.62]Kinda?
[05:52.80]Is it?
[05:58.72]It's like Binding of Isaac.
[05:59.94]Well, I love Binding of Isaac.
[06:00.94]It's a roguelike.
[06:04.70]Is it?
[06:04.96]Oh, wow.
[06:05.38]This actually could be kind of fun.
[06:06.35]Alright, you ready?
[06:11.17]When's porn week?
[06:14.28]We talked about that yesterday already.
[06:17.67]Turn on the Twitch integration.
[06:19.19]No, hold on, not yet.
[06:20.47]Let me just play first.
[06:21.57]I don't even know what this game is.
[06:22.55]I don't want to turn on the Twitch integration immediately and have like 50 things spammed on me when I don't know the controls of the game.
[06:32.21]Select streamer mode.
[06:33.65]Okay.
[06:34.45]New game.
[06:35.47]Explore a new world.
[06:36.29]The original Noita.
[06:38.25]Daily run.
[06:38.79]A new day.
[06:39.31]New world.
[06:40.45]Don't know that.
[06:41.33]Nightmare.
[06:41.71]Don't want that.
[06:42.21]Okay.
[06:43.63]I just want to do the regular game first.
[06:47.84]Yeah.
[06:48.06]I don't even know what this game is.
[06:51.94]It's just been people have been telling me to play it for like three and a half months.
[06:54.60]So you want me to turn on the like spam the enemy on top of him mode?
[07:00.80]I don't even know what left click does.
[07:02.32]Okay, here we go.
[07:09.06]Does this game suck?
[07:15.45]But we can help you.
[07:16.35]Well, hold on.
[07:16.87]We'll see.
[07:17.21]I don't want to get hacked.
[07:18.01]Okay, what came first?
[07:23.33]The chicken or the egg?
[07:24.59]Definitely the egg.
[07:26.55]Without a doubt, had to be the egg.
[07:37.95]And without question.
[07:43.06]Egg then turned into an alien.
[07:46.12]And that's how you get Noita.
[07:47.90]Witch.
[07:53.19]X-Men Wolverine Origins waiting room.
[07:57.06]You better gift a thousand subs when I play that game for ten minutes.
[08:00.34]What a fucking waste of money.
[08:01.80]What?
[08:02.22]That game is like $30 probably on eBay.
[08:07.59]And I just have to sit here and... That's such a big deal to sit here and play Wolverine for like an hour?
[08:15.01]Just sitting in a chair.
[08:16.83]I think I deserve like fucking five grand in subs.
[08:20.74]Do that?
[08:23.70]What am I talking about?
[08:27.15]Alright, so this is... Oh, it's like Terraria.
[08:29.55]Um, wait, you can fly?
[08:30.45]Okay, automatically, right off the bat, I don't want W... I want it to be space, which is good.
[08:40.64]Is there already space?
[08:43.54]Oh, shit!
[08:45.74]Is it processing?
[08:46.62]Oh, recharging.
[08:47.30]Okay, cool.
[08:49.90]What about right-click?
[08:52.86]Press F to kick.
[08:56.55]I thought that was a lie.
[08:57.29]Okay, let's move.
[09:01.52]So what do we do?
[09:04.04]What is this thing?
[09:05.12]Wand.
[09:06.92]It's a bomb.
[09:09.90]Oh, shit!
[09:12.33]I only have two of those, though.
[09:15.77]What is this thing?
[09:16.25]Potion.
[09:18.29]Equipped water.
[09:19.19]Is this how you heal?
[09:20.59]F.
[09:23.44]Okay, I'm changing that.
[09:24.44]I gotta change that.
[09:25.68]Oh, here we go.
[09:28.31]Uh, I need to change that.
[09:31.61]What is that input?
[09:32.27]Okay.
[09:34.11]Uh, mouse.
[09:35.93]What is that?
[09:36.27]There we go.
[09:37.13]I gotta change this shit.
[09:37.87]Okay, use wand, let up.
[09:40.55]I want this to just be space.
[09:42.24]Only.
[09:44.20]I will accidentally hit W and it'll piss me off.
[09:47.34]Okay.
[09:48.36]Left spray from potion.
[09:50.50]Okay.
[09:50.78]Left bow throws right.
[09:52.22]Kick.
[09:53.22]Please make that something else.
[09:55.20]I can't make that any other button.
[09:56.58]I can't make that any of my other mouse buttons.
[09:58.96]Why?
[09:59.14]Why not?
[10:01.12]I don't want it to be F. Come on.
[10:07.00]No, not.
[10:12.40]Kick to mouse?
[10:13.04]Yeah, I have weird control sometimes.
[10:14.72]Okay, to interact, E. Next item, next item, select.
[10:17.48]Okay, save, replay.
[10:18.40]Why would I need to save to replay?
[10:22.23]Eyes.
[10:22.69]Inventory?
[10:24.33]Wand.
[10:25.37]Shuffle.
[10:26.43]Number.
[10:27.17]One.
[10:27.93]Spells.
[10:28.33]Cast.
[10:28.93]One.
[10:29.87]Cast delay.
[10:30.53]Recharge time.
[10:31.73]Mana.
[10:33.47]Shuffle.
[10:33.97]Yes.
[10:36.73]Spells.
[10:37.25]One.
[10:37.49]Cast delay.
[10:38.43]Recharge time.
[10:39.25]Max mana.
[10:41.47]Okay, so these are my items.
[10:44.29]I have spells too.
[10:47.05]One and two.
[10:47.59]Yeah, I'm a mouse scroller.
[10:54.78]Entered the mines.
[10:55.96]What do I have to do?
[10:57.08]How do I play?
[11:07.64]It really is Terraria.
[11:09.10]I suck at Terraria.
[11:12.12]If there's one game I can tell you that I cannot play to save my life, it's Terraria.
[11:17.88]You guys know how awful I am with this kind of control scheme.
[11:20.70]I'm gonna die in the first level.
[11:22.34]And I'm gonna turn the stream off.
[11:23.89]This is Terraria, but it's hard and rage-inducing.
[11:30.31]Oh, come on.
[11:31.15]I'm not gonna do well at all.
[11:34.61]What?
[11:35.01]You just have to go down?
[11:36.18]Hold on.
[11:40.94]Let's not say that yet.
[11:53.98]Am I on fire?
[11:54.68]How do I get the poison off?
[11:57.22]Drink the potion.
[12:01.08]Why is it not working?
[12:07.48]Wash yourself off.
[12:09.50]Okay, so I'm wet now.
[12:10.89]That means I can take extra damage from electricity.
[12:12.75]I did that on purpose.
[12:16.03]Fuck you.
[12:20.07]Ooh, what's this?
[12:21.15]Blow it up.
[12:28.37]Hey!
[12:31.57]Why did that not blow up?
[12:32.37]Alright, douse that fire.
[12:44.20]What the fuck is going on here?
[12:45.60]Is this gas?
[12:48.66]Alright, whatever.
[12:50.24]I want this heart.
[13:11.22]I knew that was going to explode.
[13:12.20]Whoa!
[13:12.78]This is lots of pixels!
[13:15.44]Okay, now I'm going to douse that.
[13:16.42]Oh, there's a little indicator.
[13:20.06]That's cool.
[13:21.60]That's helpful.
[13:24.84]That doesn't go that far, dude.
[13:26.22]Did it work?
[13:34.87]Picked up extra max HP.
[13:37.57]Increased to 125.
[13:39.11]What is this thing?
[13:41.19]What is all this?
[13:43.05]Wand?
[13:43.68]Press E to pick up this new wand.
[13:48.40]Oh, okay.
[13:48.92]So this is... Shuffle?
[13:52.76]No.
[13:54.50]Faster recharge time.
[13:56.04]Lower cast delay.
[13:57.16]And spread.
[14:00.39]Should I replace it?
[14:02.57]Picked up a magic wand.
[14:11.39]Oh, he's not shooting.
[14:12.07]Shuffle, no.
[14:22.08]Wands that shuffle cast their spells in random order.
[14:28.10]The number of spells this wand casts when used.
[14:30.42]One.
[14:31.30]Cast delay.
[14:32.22]Spread.
[14:33.26]Spark bolt.
[14:35.22]A weak but enchanting sparkling projectile.
[14:39.61]How come it's not shooting?
[14:40.43]What's this one?
[14:42.13]Slow orb void.
[14:43.23]You mess with it in the four slots.
[14:49.27]This game didn't tell me this.
[14:50.23]I don't know what the fuck's going on.
[14:54.15]Why is this not shooting, though?
[14:57.83]Is it, or am I just crazy?
[15:00.02]You need more mana.
[15:03.20]Oh, shit.
[15:03.68]Okay, hold on.
[15:04.54]What about a chili egg?
[15:05.58]Picked up chili egg.
[15:08.40]Okay.
[15:17.08]Okay, cool.
[15:21.04]What's this thing?
[15:25.61]An invisibilium potion?
[15:27.11]Okay, I feel like I just said that word wrong.
[15:32.50]I feel like I said invisible wrong.
[15:34.32]What does that mean?
[15:40.93]Actually, this game's... Okay, I'm starting to get ahead of this.
[15:44.35]It's pretty cool.
[15:45.79]Ow.
[15:46.64]I didn't even see that guy.
[15:47.42]What happens if I die?
[15:49.46]Minus 15 chat?
[15:57.64]You get a game over.
[15:58.38]Okay, this guy is firing missiles at me.
[16:01.22]Okay, when the music starts... Does it mean that that's a hard encounter when the music starts playing like this?
[16:16.91]I just put water on him?
[16:18.51]I'm gonna die.
[16:20.33]Alright, I'm good.
[16:28.01]I'm alright.
[16:29.69]Do I get experience?
[16:30.95]Throw the egg.
[16:31.51]It spawns a friendly creature.
[16:37.29]Oh, what?
[16:37.81]That's pretty cool.
[16:38.99]Alright, what's this thing do?
[16:44.56]Do they follow me around?
[16:48.06]Ow, ow, ow.
[16:49.38]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[16:50.12]Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water.
[16:54.27]Water!
[16:54.69]Put water on me.
[16:55.73]That's not water?
[16:56.35]Oh, fuck this guy.
[17:02.41]Get down there and kill him.
[17:07.39]Go down there and hurt that guy.
[17:12.05]Shit.
[17:16.00]Go down there and kill him!
[17:26.31]Ow!
[17:26.99]Hey, what the fuck?
[17:27.95]Click here for stats.
[17:35.23]Cool.
[17:35.77]Okay, progress.
[17:36.90]Six new progress?
[17:40.22]Holy Jesus, this is fucking huge.
[17:45.76]Okay, cool.
[17:46.58]This is a lot of stuff.
[17:49.88]New game.
[17:51.29]New game.
[17:55.49]Oh, Jesus.
[17:56.73]Okay, so now what?
[17:58.55]Do I... Run on streamer mode?
[18:06.18]No, not yet.
[18:07.10]I need to even find out, like, how to equip items and shit.
[18:16.17]Alright, I'm gonna start to try really hard.
[18:17.51]That was a headshot.
[18:21.83]Right off the bat, good.
[18:24.35]So, the whole point of the game is to go down.
[18:27.55]Something in here.
[18:33.65]What's that?
[18:35.72]Did I break this with a bomb?
[18:43.84]What is this?
[18:46.54]Okay, chaotic polymorphine potion?
[18:49.35]Can I see what it does?
[18:51.79]Equip and throw.
[18:58.13]Right mouse button, drink.
[19:02.63]It's like a Harry Potter thing?
[19:03.63]Alright, let's go.
[19:04.05]What are you gonna play?
[19:08.71]Wolverine.
[19:10.56]Yeah, you saw it happen when people did that.
[19:12.08]When I played Ratatouille, I may as well have just, like, just not even turned on the stream that day.
[19:25.11]This thing seems, like, more powerful this time.
[19:26.59]Why?
[19:26.75]You guys notice that?
[19:33.26]This thing is, like, stronger.
[19:36.74]Old nugget.
[19:37.28]Alright, so how do I go?
[19:38.16]Is there, like, a place I can go back and spend the money?
[19:41.27]The starting wand is randomized.

[19:48.09]Spread 0.5 degrees.
[19:49.53]Cast delay.
[19:51.24]So the wand is just the thing that houses the spell inside of it.
[19:54.52]The wand is not its own item.
[19:56.30]Well, it kind of is, but it isn't.
[20:00.28]This game is... Alright, what's this?

[21:01.29]I like it.
[21:01.65]It's a rogue light Jerma.
[21:04.77]There's no save point.
[21:05.77]Yeah, but I could probably go back and spend money.
[21:08.49]What's the gold for in that case?
[21:11.64]Let's go down even further.
[21:18.56]Noita.
[21:22.43]Come on, bounce.
[21:25.89]I don't think this is even a rage game for me.
[21:30.55]This is more of like a, I understand I'll never do this game.
[21:34.19]And it doesn't bother me that much.
[21:36.58]Really, that kind of doesn't.
[21:41.56]What is this?
[21:43.48]This is different.
[21:45.66]Pheromone potion.
[21:47.84]Just drink it?
[21:50.40]Oops.
[21:58.67]Cover myself in pheromones?

[22:37.43]Oh, the worm's gonna explode, right?
[22:38.87]Oh, watch out for the room that it blows up.
[22:40.16]Alright, what's this thing do?
[22:42.10]Okay, that's awesome.
[22:42.92]I can only shoot that a few times.
[22:44.04]Ten times.
[22:48.02]I'm gonna go right.
[22:52.78]He's mad at that.
[22:53.76]No, I'm not.
[22:54.27]I'm fine.
[23:02.49]Fuck.
[23:02.97]I'm so bad at Terraria type shooting.
[23:05.60]I swear to God.
[23:06.40]This is why I don't play these games.
[23:10.73]Because you have to look at where your character is and the whole other side of the screen.
[23:15.42]Like, if I'm right here and I have to look over here, I have no idea what's happening here.
[23:19.54]Gold despawns.
[23:30.37]Oh, that sucks.
[23:30.97]Can you drown?
[23:37.93]Yup!

[23:50.06]Get up, get up, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:51.40]Up, up, up, up, up.
[23:53.18]Why does it want me to... What's this for?
[23:54.34]Can I, like, blow this up or something?
[24:03.52]You can eat corpses.
[24:07.07]Ow.
[24:09.39]Meat.
[24:09.65]Is that how you heal?
[24:20.28]Oh shit, I'm just eating dirt on the ground.
[24:26.08]Does that help?
[24:26.44]Is it hurting me?
[24:30.30]There's meat here, right?
[24:35.83]The character can also throw up.
[24:37.23]Alright, what is this one?
[24:40.13]Ooh!
[24:45.67]Is this a lamp?
[24:51.10]It's just a torch.
[24:51.81]Oh, I'll probably need it later.
[24:52.69]Alright, cool.
[24:57.67]Oh, I have a friend egg.
[25:04.91]What's the 10%?
[25:06.02]Is that 10% hungry?

[25:13.64]Okay, everyone back up.
[25:20.77]Mouse over it.
[25:22.09]Your stomach is almost empty.
[25:23.19]I have to eat.
[25:23.81]But is it actually food?
[25:26.95]You have to actually... There's hunger in the game and you start dying if you don't eat.
[25:34.97]No.
[25:35.37]Oh, okay.
[25:37.69]Why am I on fire?
[25:41.37]How do I... Get in the mud.
[25:53.65]Why did I go in the muddy water?
[25:56.61]Okay, I'm fine.
[25:58.01]Where did my friend go?
[26:00.23]Carve myself in form ones again.
[26:15.16]Nice.
[26:15.42]Alright, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

[26:42.46]Oh yeah, I can.
[26:44.96]Bloody clothes protect you from fire.
[26:46.84]Okay, that's good to know.
[26:48.64]If I cover myself in blood, then I can't be burned anymore?
[26:57.51]Alright, that thing's big and horrible.

[27:06.02]Just go!
[27:06.20]Alright, I found it!
[27:11.24]I found it!

[28:12.04]The right one.
[28:12.66]You can customize wands while here.
[28:18.29]Really?
[28:20.01]Purple is boring.
[28:23.43]Wait, what?
[28:27.85]Hold on a second.
[28:28.80]This is getting a little too deep for my brain to understand.
[28:31.80]So I can do magic missile fire and energy sphere.
[28:44.14]What does that do?
[28:48.91]It can arc and bounce.
[28:51.97]Put the orb spell on the second wand.
[28:56.66]Oh, I get it.
[28:57.46]Okay, so I got the orb there.
[28:58.76]I got fire here.
[29:00.22]Should I do... Okay, fire.
[29:02.44]Test it on the statues.
[29:05.55]Do I lose mana?
[29:13.17]No, no, no, don't.
[29:13.81]Yes, you do.
[29:14.68]Mana regens and it's per wand.
[29:17.58]It's 10 cast.
[29:18.48]Put orb on red wand.
[29:19.92]Buy the wand to the right, put the orb in its open slot.
[29:27.24]Uh, what do you want to drop?
[29:28.44]Okay, um, how about the torch?
[29:32.30]Who cares about the torch?
[29:34.98]Fuck the torch.

[29:36.86]Okay, I got this wand.
[29:45.05]And now... Oops.

[29:58.94]Alright, let me think.
[30:00.84]So I have... Here it is.
[30:01.76]A slow orb of void that eats through all obstacles.
[30:10.19]So it's a projectile.
[30:11.03]So...
[30:14.55]What's this here?
[30:15.15]Warning, this wand does not have enough mana for Black Hole.
[30:18.23]Wand has max 63 mana.
[30:19.81]Casting Black Hole requires 180 mana.
[30:20.89]Um, alright.
[30:21.43]Wait, how do I, where's the, so I need 180, I only have 63 fucking mana.
[30:36.96]How much mana does this wand have?
[30:39.32]113.
[30:39.36]What about this one?
[30:41.14]180, alright, here we go.
[30:41.72]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
[30:45.68]This has 180 mana.
[30:52.69]So now I can... But I can only shoot this three times.
[30:56.91]Is that accurate?
[31:00.61]That's the black hole.
[31:01.35]It's cool.
[31:03.41]So I can only shoot this three times, but it's super insanely powerful, right?
[31:06.94]Alright, so only do this for like an oh shit scenario.
[31:14.34]So I gotta put this somewhere else.
[31:17.44]Can I move stuff in my hotbar?
[31:21.02]I don't want that to be three.
[31:21.82]I want that to be all the way over here.
[31:29.36]What the fuck?
[31:33.69]Oh, okay.
[31:34.67]So I want this to be my main wand.
[31:38.49]Just the shooting.
[31:39.15]Just shoot.
[31:39.95]This is the secondary for the explosive.
[31:41.45]This is the bomb.

[32:29.12]This is pretty cool, actually.
[32:30.14]What does this do?
[32:35.33]10, 20 damage for a headshot?
[32:36.39]Or is it just random?
[32:41.95]Black hole does not do damage.
[32:43.39]Well, I can black hole people and then... That's alright.
[32:49.83]I can't... Whoops.

[33:06.72]A jewel!
[33:09.12]Jewels...
[33:11.84]Alright, easy.
[33:16.76]I'm not gonna black hole down there.

[33:22.80]Okay.
[33:26.99]What is this stuff classified as?
[33:28.11]This pink stuff.
[33:29.55]What is the pink stuff?
[33:30.89]Slimy clothes protect you from fire.
[33:32.63]So it's just slime.
[33:33.37]I guess get a bomb.
[33:43.51]Thank you.
[33:46.07]Wait, I can be completely protected from fire?
[33:49.05]What if I eat the slime?
[33:49.93]Whoa, don't eat the slime!
[33:51.05]You're feeling sick.
[33:51.82]Nothing stays inside.
[33:52.74]You puke.
[33:53.34]Okay, what does that do for me?
[33:56.76]Is there a debuff?
[34:02.12]That's disgusting.
[34:03.92]So, you don't get a bottle of water.
[34:05.74]I'm protected by fire, though.
[34:07.00]I'm protected by fire.
[34:08.34]Go, go, go.
[34:08.88]Quick, quick, quick.
[34:09.68]While it's still on.
[34:18.59]Ow.
[34:18.67]Alright, we're good.
[34:29.10]Slime makes you slow, though.
[34:31.00]What is this?
[34:32.76]Bloody clothes protects you from- Okay, so blood and slime protects you from fire.
[34:36.02]And you can eat blood.
[34:39.76]You can also eat gunpowder if you feel like it.
[34:41.95]But it would be a very bad idea.
[34:44.67]Gold vein?
[34:45.43]What's that?
[34:45.83]How do I get that?
[34:51.18]Oh shit, did I get it?
[34:51.94]Did I get it?
[34:59.26]Nice, okay, cool.
[35:01.46]This game's pretty fun.
[35:02.26]You know what, okay, this is- this is all the parts of Terraria that are cool without the craft- this is just non-crafting Terraria.
[35:11.68]I don't have to, like, open up a Wikipedia page with 5,000 articles on it.
[35:16.59]I just get cool item and just use.
[35:28.48]I'll get hit.
[35:29.78]That thing, that's a mega wand down there.
[35:31.48]What is that thing?
[35:37.79]Hey, whoa, he's picking up what you can hit.
[35:39.27]Wait, what?
[35:40.39]They can pick up the items?
[35:42.24]He stole that.
[35:43.42]He just stole it from me.
[35:44.88]That thing was insane.
[35:46.42]Where did he go?
[35:52.69]Where did he go?
[35:53.35]He just sniped that!
[35:55.65]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[35:56.83]Really?
[35:57.23]They can take the items?
[35:59.09]I gotta go find this motherfucker.
[36:00.61]Give me that!
[36:01.55]Oh, he- he- okay, I think he died.
[36:04.49]Wait, I don't wanna touch that though.
[36:09.58]There's poison right there.
[36:10.58]Holy shit, what is this thing?
[36:17.57]Always casts... Okay, it's a gas tank.
[36:21.37]That's a gas station.
[36:23.51]Always casts... Devil Spread.
[36:26.71]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[36:27.79]That motherfucker stole a wand again.
[36:32.21]Okay.
[36:33.33]What do I just... I don't know what it does.
[36:40.71]Spitter Bolt with Timer.
[36:42.51]A short-lived magical bolt that casts another spell after a timer runs out.
[36:48.41]Um, is that cooler than this?
[36:49.67]How much mana does it cost?
[37:05.13]Okay, this is pretty sick.
[37:12.13]It's a firework gun.
[37:18.51]You can only fire it once a second though.
[37:21.97]It's got big damage too, doesn't it?
[37:23.59]Alright, yeah, let's go.
[37:26.37]Hold on, wait, not yet.
[37:27.42]What's over here?
[37:27.84]Nothing.
[37:35.08]I need more gold?
[37:36.00]Alright, well, I don't have any money.
[37:37.70]I only have 93 bucks.
[37:40.47]I got tons of damage now.
[37:41.49]Okay, I don't know if that was weird.
[37:46.53]Let's go.
[37:50.70]I'm starting to understand how this works.
[37:51.84]Task delay.
[38:01.86]Is that thing alive down there?
[38:07.46]Put black hole on this one.
[38:08.76]Hold on.
[38:09.64]My brain cannot function that quickly.
[38:11.94]I need at least one to two hours of failing before I figure out the basic function of the video game.
[38:25.91]Ooh, slime.
[38:27.39]Alright, so remember, from the slime fork, I gotta go left and down to get to the end.
[38:36.53]Important to know.
[38:37.27]Oh, watch it.
[38:37.81]Somebody just threw that at me.
[38:41.05]Alright, I'm going up.
[38:47.08]Does the little mouse do that?
[38:54.53]What is this?
[38:55.86]Oh, right.
[38:56.32]I forgot about that.
[38:58.34]I can't get hurt by poison now.
[39:02.42]Well.
[39:05.98]I'm not going to need another item ever.
[39:08.40]This thing is insanely good.
[39:09.88]Treasure chest right here.
[39:16.21]Alright, open up the treasure chest.
[39:18.65]Okay, should I shoot it?
[39:24.16]How do I open it?
[39:28.78]Oh my god.
[39:29.74]That's a lot of money.
[39:30.32]Okay, good.
[39:31.50]Alright.
[39:32.10]I opened up the... That's a pretty fat treasure chest right there.
[39:40.56]Coded.
[39:42.62]Get it all over me.
[39:49.63]No!
[39:50.41]Give me.
[39:51.09]Sorry.
[39:52.79]This wand is massive.
[40:00.39]How much is there to explore?
[40:01.69]This is kind of insane.
[40:02.65]Can I kick this?
[40:05.29]Okay, can I kick this down?
[40:06.18]Is this going to explode on me if I kick this?
[40:10.24]Alright, good.
[40:12.14]It's infinite?
[40:17.69]Activate streamer mode.
[40:18.65]No, no, not yet.
[40:24.35]Ooh, we got two things over here.
[40:25.69]What's this?
[40:27.74]Oh, can I?
[40:28.96]Hmm.
[40:29.76]I have to blow this up.
[40:40.21]I'm on fire.
[40:40.63]I'm on fire.
[40:41.01]I'm on fire.
[40:41.57]I'm on fire.
[40:41.95]I'm on fire.
[40:42.27]Get the poison.
[40:42.75]Okay.
[40:43.85]I can stand the poison.
[40:44.79]Get the fuck away from me.
[40:55.10]Stop, please.
[40:56.60]Oh, my God.
[40:57.04]Don't die here.
[41:03.99]What the fuck, please!
[41:05.19]No, don't drink the poison!
[41:07.42]Okay, I'm fine.
[41:09.22]I'm gonna relax.
[41:11.50]Fire bats are hell.
[41:13.84]I'm trying to get this thing... Alright, what is this?
[41:15.72]Concentrated mana.
[41:16.66]What's the other one?
[41:23.99]Jump, aim, up, and kick.
[41:27.31]Oh, okay, cool.
[41:30.07]Shit, what the hell was that?
[41:32.47]What did I do?
[41:32.99]What is that?
[41:33.51]What potion?
[41:34.11]Just get in here and drink it.
[41:39.66]Worm.
[41:41.46]You feel like your future worm food.
[41:43.90]Cause ingesting worm pheromones.
[41:45.50]What does that mean?
[41:46.18]Okay.
[41:52.99]First of all.
[41:54.59]Speaking of pheromones.
[41:56.65]Let's get coated.
[41:58.65]And let's get coated in the berserk potion too.
[42:01.74]Now I'm fucking angry.
[42:02.56]What's this mean?
[42:04.06]A berserk curse affects you.
[42:05.52]Alright, what does it do?
[42:06.12]And then what's this one?
[42:09.80]Concentrated mana.
[42:14.35]You gain mana back faster.
[42:15.59]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[42:16.43]Give me that whole thing.
[42:28.17]I'm wasting it?
[42:28.74]I don't know how that works.
[42:30.10]Just drink it from the ground?
[42:33.46]Okay, let's go.
[42:42.65]I think I have enough money to leave.
[42:43.73]Yeah, let's go.
[42:50.33]Refill the health.
[42:50.97]Refill the... It's a stain.
[42:53.66]It wears off after a few seconds.
[42:54.94]Drink it instead.
[42:56.20]Oh, okay.
[42:57.94]I'm just staining my clothes.
[43:02.49]Right click a potion just to drink it.
[43:03.81]Okay.
[43:04.03]Try black hole before refilling wand.
[43:08.20]Oh, I didn't.
[43:08.70]Sorry.
[43:09.52]Alright, what do we got?
[43:11.72]This... It's too much.
[43:15.02]It's too much for me to think about.
[43:16.36]Okay, this is a lot of... I don't know what any of this is.
[43:18.26]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[43:22.28]What am I looking for?
[43:24.67]Out of all these things.
[43:26.67]Is it... Like... What am I looking for?
[43:33.76]What are the numbers that I should be looking at here?
[43:38.45]Check the perks.
[43:42.19]Oh, I see what you mean.
[43:43.15]Check and see if I can make these better.
[43:44.75]Okay, this is Wand Experimenter.
[43:48.89]I don't know what that does.
[43:51.51]Extra knockback on spells and Teleport Titus Dodge.
[44:00.15]Teleport a short distance away when an enemy projectile is near.
[44:02.78]I don't know if I want that.
[44:03.68]I feel like that kind of sucks.
[44:06.02]It's going to teleport me into a fire pit.
[44:08.02]Alright, let's take a look at these.
[44:13.68]This is question mark.
[44:14.78]Okay, this is question mark, question mark, question mark.
[44:17.80]Mystery spell.
[44:19.64]This is always cat.
[44:22.14]I don't even know what these are.
[44:26.38]Wait, what?
[44:27.96]Oh my god.
[44:28.48]What, what, what?
[44:29.12]Press E. What's happening?
[44:32.85]Those are lightsabers.
[44:35.11]Laser, laser, laser.
[44:35.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:36.77]I don't understand what's happening.
[44:38.55]What's going on?
[44:40.07]Press E to read spells.
[44:42.09]No, press E to purchase wand.
[44:44.72]Oh, okay.
[44:45.22]Right.
[44:48.38]I like this a lot.
[44:48.96]I don't want to get rid of this.
[44:52.30]This one is eh.
[44:53.12]But this can blow up walls.
[44:56.92]This one's kind of stupid.
[44:59.16]And this one is my black hole.
[45:01.54]So I'm going to... I don't like this one.
[45:05.06]What do these do?
[45:06.02]A somewhat peculiar bouncy explosive bolt.
[45:08.36]25 uses.
[45:10.17]Uses 50 mana.
[45:13.77]45 damage.
[45:14.43]That's a lot of damage.
[45:17.85]That's a shitload of damage.
[45:24.56]Alright, question for all of you experts.
[45:28.32]So, this wand has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 slots.
[45:35.41]Which means that when I click left click, it uses this one.
[45:39.03]Then when I do it again, it uses this one.
[45:40.63]When I do it again, it uses this one.
[45:42.05]And if there's another thing here, it uses that one on the fourth click.
[45:45.79]Is that how that works?
[45:48.34]If it's shuffle, it's just gonna do a random one in here, right?
[45:55.71]Okay, starting to understand.
[46:03.16]You really want non-shuffle wands.
[46:05.82]Okay.
[46:08.72]Starting to figure this out.
[46:11.96]Uh, let's see, what's this one?
[46:13.87]This one looks interesting.
[46:15.79]Shuffle no, so it just goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, always.
[46:22.28]Axe mana set to 210.
[46:25.84]Always casts increased mana.
[46:28.06]Immediately adds 30 mana to the wand.
[46:31.81]Double spell.
[46:32.67]Casts two spells.
[46:35.23]Gives a projectile a much lower cast delay, but no respect to your aim.
[46:41.48]But these aren't moves.
[46:45.68]Luminous drill with timer.
[46:46.94]A pinpointed short-range beam of concentrated light that casts another spell after a timer runs out.
[46:52.57]What spell does it cast?
[46:53.47]It just does this three times.
[46:58.70]So, I click, double spell, click, heavy, super heavy, and then click, timer!
[47:05.88]So I have to click three times.
[47:10.06]No.
[47:13.11]So I don't click one, two, three to get here.
[47:16.03]You hold the button down.
[47:19.33]Just click once.
[47:21.72]No, you click once and it just goes bananas.
[47:23.26]Okay, alright.
[47:26.08]I'll give it a try.
[47:29.30]Okay.
[47:37.48]What?
[47:43.67]How is this good?
[47:45.07]Is this what it looks like if you accidentally hit your TV with your Wiimote?
[47:53.00]How is this any good?
[47:59.86]Remove the spread on it.
[48:02.85]Heavy spread.
[48:03.65]Alright, let's take off the heavy spread.
[48:16.70]Alright.
[48:23.76]Does massive damage?
[48:29.30]Alright, cool.
[48:29.82]Alright, this is cool.
[48:31.28]Alright, now what?
[48:33.66]Okay, so now I've got my standard fried and true fireworks wand.
[48:39.07]I've got my explosive blow-up stuff wand.
[48:42.13]And I've got the... Wait, remove double.
[48:46.79]Why?
[48:46.97]Why?
[48:51.02]Why?
[48:53.92]Take the two lasers off.
[49:00.81]It already casts two.
[49:02.29]It's already doing double cast.
[49:03.87]Oh.
[49:04.67]It's just using more... Oh, I see.
[49:06.63]Okay.
[49:08.35]So should I put... Wait.
[49:09.15]Should I put something else on here?
[49:10.32]What about like... What about energy sphere?
[49:17.22]Oh!
[49:17.56]Look at that!
[49:25.95]It shoots energy sphere too.
[49:32.22]That's a lot of mana though.
[49:33.52]Yeah, you're right.
[49:34.12]It is probably very inefficient.
[49:35.90]Very inefficient.
[49:36.68]Take it off.
[49:39.92]Wait, what about these?
[49:40.44]What about like the bubble thing?
[49:42.98]No, no.
[49:43.20]Over here.
[49:50.21]I kind of like bubble laser.
[49:53.24]It's inefficient though.
[49:54.10]Ah, okay.
[49:54.78]Now I understand why everybody loves this game.
[49:57.02]This is cool.
[50:02.36]Less is more, less is more, less is more.
[50:07.36]Take off extra lasers.
[50:11.41]Did I?
[50:13.01]One laser only.
[50:14.15]Oh wait, but isn't it doing like three times the firepower?
[50:22.19]It doesn't matter.
[50:27.70]Alright, so let me ask.
[50:29.52]What's the point of having three of these on?
[50:31.84]What would it do?
[50:37.72]No, that sucks.
[50:46.19]Put them all on.
[50:51.91]Yeah.
[50:52.35]What about two?
[51:02.30]Okay, this is more consistent.
[51:05.05]It's a little less long, but I can fire way more.
[51:10.39]That's a pretty good compromise.
[51:11.81]Yeah, it is.
[51:13.07]Put bubble spark, bubble spark, then laser.
[51:20.08]Is this bubble spark?
[51:21.54]Bubble spark, where's that?
[51:24.36]Bubble spark, bubble spark.
[51:27.10]Laser, laser, laser.
[51:28.39]Laser.
[51:30.43]Laser.
[51:38.44]That's really cool.
[51:43.38]This is awesome.
[51:44.20]Okay, but no, inefficient.
[51:50.80]I'm still, okay, I'm still understanding this.
[51:55.15]So, hold on a second.
[51:57.55]This is, my brain is doing all kinds of computations here.
[52:00.99]So when I click once with shuffle on no, it starts here and does all three in a row.
[52:06.37]Whatever is in a row here just does them in a row.
[52:10.42]This is not like click once, then for this one casts, click once, then this one casts, like in a succession.
[52:15.68]I just click once and it just plays out like, just plays out the song, right?
[52:23.47]If it's shuffle, then it does it in a random direction.
[52:27.03]So like, let's say it shuffles on, it could, yeah, I click once and it goes like this way, that way, that way, that way, and that way to end the spell.
[52:39.47]Don't break the temple.
[52:42.47]I'm mixing it up.
[52:43.03]Alright, well let me just use this now.
[52:50.11]I'll get it eventually.
[52:53.53]Pretty good compromise.
[52:54.29]Alright, I got 120 bucks.
[53:01.49]Goes through all of them because they're our timer.
[53:03.91]Let's see.
[53:06.30]Limer and trigger spells can cast other spells.
[53:08.76]Oh God, this is a lot of info.
[53:10.30]But it's like, look, you know what?
[53:11.58]I'm not even going to like, I'll just get you guys help from time to time.
[53:15.02]Because I, you know, it's, I have no idea what the fuck's going on.
[53:17.25]I'll be honest with you.
[53:18.07]I kind of get it.
[53:31.30]Not a big fan of that range.
[53:32.94]Not a big fan of the range.
[53:36.18]Okay, now this is another one.
[53:37.12]What the fuck is this?
[53:38.98]Spells cast 1.
[53:40.76]Cast delay 3.
[53:41.70]Max mana capacity.
[53:42.88]What is this one?
[53:46.74]This is double double light bomb.
[53:52.17]It's trash.
[53:54.19]An explosive wand.
[53:55.01]It's just more bombs.
[53:57.83]Should I replace it with this one?
[54:09.53]So let's just double double bomb.
[54:14.74]Nah.
[54:15.54]Nah.
[54:16.38]Nah.
[54:21.45]I gotta change this up a little too.
[54:23.71]Move this.
[54:24.07]That's better.
[54:25.60]So I can really easily switch between the two of them.
[54:36.44]Dude, this is like fucking me up, man.
[54:39.90]This teleporting, I don't know if I like very much.
[54:53.30]I'm taking way too many.
[54:54.54]Wait, are these... Saving his ass?
[55:01.39]Yeah, but it's like teleporting me in random directions that I don't want to be in.
[55:09.46]You can't take the spells, chat.
[55:11.88]No, you can't.
[55:12.44]Yeah, I guess you can't, like, rip it apart.
[55:19.57]I'll be honest with you guys.
[55:20.69]I'm not sure I like this very much.
[55:24.03]It doesn't do enough damage to compensate for the fact that you gotta get pretty close.
[55:27.59]I'm not sure I like it.
[55:32.54]You can take the spells to the next mountain.
[55:39.64]Fuck, I got hurt.
[55:49.61]I hate those guys.
[55:50.49]They're so accurate.
[56:02.93]You can dig with the laser?
[56:06.99]Can?
[56:11.18]This is different.
[56:11.86]Okay, what's this one?
[56:13.86]Electric charge.
[56:14.54]It gives a projectile electric charge.
[56:16.88]It's splitter bolt.
[56:19.12]So it's an electric electricity that explodes.
[56:22.14]Alright, let's try it.
[56:30.37]Holy shit, okay.
[56:32.75]No!
[56:33.01]Give me that!
[56:33.51]Don't take that!
[56:34.07]It's mine.
[56:36.62]Use it.
[56:36.92]Pepe left.
[56:43.09]I actually kind of like it.
[56:45.05]It seems pretty good.
[56:45.77]Yeah, I like it.
[56:53.54]Does it do?
[56:53.96]Wait, how much damage does it do?
[57:01.60]Plus three damage electric.
[57:04.35]Eight.
[57:04.83]So like, you know, 15, 20, 30.
[57:10.51]I think I'm going to leave this.
[57:11.31]I don't think I want that anymore.
[57:14.52]Yeah.
[57:15.52]That's sad though.
[57:21.53]Dig.
[57:25.47]I'm digging.
[57:26.17]Look.
[57:36.66]Look.
[57:36.84]There's water down here.
[57:43.66]Who would have thought?
[57:44.84]It's a snow level.
[57:49.41]Yeah, I'm a big fan of this.
[57:52.33]It's a lot of... It's spammable.
[57:54.47]It's very damageable.
[57:55.51]It's very cool.
[57:56.19]I'm into it.
[58:00.45]Oh, this is great.
[58:01.61]This is really great, actually.
[58:02.59]This is very great.
[58:06.63]Let him burn.
[58:08.53]Let him burn.
[58:13.12]of bubble Sparks.
[58:14.12]This thing's got a lot of health.
[58:17.48]Alright, you know what?
[58:22.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[58:24.36]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[58:37.74]He's so good at aiming!
[58:39.76]I'm stuck in the wall.
[58:42.22]Help!
[58:42.46]Am I drowning?
[58:44.12]I'm not drowning, am I?
[58:46.50]Get me out of here.
[58:52.94]Get me out of here, he's gonna kill me.
[58:57.40]I don't have very much health, I gotta- Fuck, that hurt.
[59:03.17]That hurt, that hurt, that hurt.
[59:04.25]Do I have any healing potions?
[59:05.27]I thought you said right-click drinks!
[59:14.94]You guys probably right-clicked rank, didn't you?
[59:18.28]You have to do it in the inventory.
[59:19.62]Okay, so it is fucking Terraria, isn't it?
[59:23.24]Snowman?
[59:23.66]Is that an enemy?
[59:31.03]It looks like an enemy.
[59:31.69]It could be.
[59:38.17]Jesus.
[59:43.85]Okay, in the inventory.
[59:45.71]Berserk potion.
[59:47.33]Right click.
[59:49.11]Berserk, 12 seconds.
[59:51.11]Okay, I'm berserk right now.
[59:51.87]What does that mean?
[59:59.52]Get him!
[60:04.48]These guys suck.
[60:08.28]It's bigger explosions?
[60:09.44]Ooh.
[60:16.15]Watch it.
[60:17.31]Alright, I'm gonna drop a fucking bomb down there.
[60:19.27]Do I eat this stuff?
[60:26.73]This is meat, right?
[60:27.60]No, this is blood.
[60:28.70]Rotten meat.
[60:29.18]Don't eat that.
[60:32.66]Jesus.
[60:33.04]Dude, how are you supposed to dodge that shit?
[60:36.84]They fire so...
[60:45.39]Berserk mode, let's go.
[60:46.23]Whoa!
[60:59.98]Oh!
[61:00.84]It really is saving my ass so much.
[61:04.22]I complain about it because it's like hard to see what I'm doing, but it really is like saving me.
[61:08.40]That's fire and I'm dead.
[61:09.93]That's fire, I'm dead.
[61:10.57]Am I alive?
[61:18.75]That work?
[61:31.22]Use the black hole.
[61:32.78]I don't need it yet.
[61:36.40]Ocean will put out a fire, okay.
[61:43.63]Watch out for that shit.
[61:45.45]Ocean!
[61:46.09]Wait, get the money first.
[61:48.63]Oh!
[61:49.31]Should I... Should I risk it or should I just go?
[61:52.61]I only have $193.
[61:57.93]Wait, what's this?
[62:00.85]It's invisibility.
[62:02.57]Oh, good thing I didn't go right in that portal.
[62:04.91]Because look at what this is.
[62:09.27]Ah, good thing I didn't go in.
[62:14.11]Double scatter.
[62:16.36]Double-double scatter, gunpowder, and then glowing lance.
[62:24.74]Hmm.
[62:26.47]Let's give it a try.
[62:32.35]Okay, this is dangerous.
[62:37.49]That's dangerous.
[62:38.17]This is dangerous, but it's pretty good.
[62:49.08]Fires.
[62:50.56]Okay.
[62:52.94]Yeah, fuck that thing.
[63:06.41]You can take the gunpowder.
[63:07.55]Wait, what?
[63:10.61]Oh, thank God you heal every time.
[63:13.21]Leave, you dumb fuck.
[63:14.81]I... I did.
[63:16.75]I'm leaving.
[63:20.72]Spell layout's not good on this.
[63:26.22]Not.
[63:26.58]Alright, so, hold on.
[63:29.16]So, what, should I do this instead?
[63:37.46]And that guy.
[63:38.02]This has amazing stats.
[63:40.80]Alright, wait a minute.
[63:46.40]Okay, now I can buy spells, but I don't have enough money.
[63:52.21]I'm gonna have to buy this.
[63:53.53]Electric Ark.
[63:57.66]Stop hoarding the black hole, you cuck.
[64:04.86]Okay.
[64:07.44]Buy this.
[64:07.98]Alright, so let's make a cool spell.
[64:11.15]Alright, so I have Electrical Ark.
[64:13.89]I'm gonna do Electrical Ark.
[64:16.17]And then all this.
[64:17.81]What just happened?
[64:18.27]Where'd that go?
[64:21.00]Where'd that spell go?
[64:22.98]How does that look?
[64:28.14]Let's try it.
[64:41.41]Dude, this is too much.
[64:45.99]Remove the gunpowder?
[65:03.18]Put the lightning in the front.
[65:12.51]Remove one of the lances.
[65:24.31]This is pretty sick actually.
[65:27.45]Take another lance off.
[65:29.29]Let's see.
[65:39.38]Yeah, three's better.
[65:48.47]Can I make my... This is my favorite wand.
[65:50.73]Can I make this any better?
[65:52.27]Wait, what if I do electrical arcing here?
[65:54.19]Get this shit out.
[66:10.94]It's okay.
[66:11.76]It looked cool for a minute.
[66:17.70]Needs two projectiles.
[66:20.00]Oh, right.
[66:20.96]Okay, I see.
[66:23.88]So the goal here is to try to get things in the middle of this, right?
[66:29.13]So if I hit something right in the middle inside that wedge.
[66:35.33]Try putting a laser on the green wand.
[66:41.92]What do you mean, a laser?
[66:49.31]Oh, dude, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[66:52.71]Wait a minute.
[66:59.01]What happens if I do this?
[67:10.48]Nope, not very good.
[67:19.72]That's better.
[67:24.36]Laser is the green thing.
[67:29.89]Oh, okay.
[67:30.23]Hold on.
[67:30.63]Wait.
[67:30.85]Let's try this one.
[67:35.83]Oh, yeah!
[67:37.41]That's... I'm leaving it there.
[67:40.91]What happened?
[67:44.67]Why can I not fire this anymore?
[67:48.21]I have no mana.
[67:49.09]How do I get mana to go fast?
[67:52.71]That's so slow.
[67:53.79]Aww.
[67:56.75]That's too bad.
[67:58.31]What about this?
[68:00.07]Nope.
[68:06.05]Nope.
[68:19.80]Put only laser on it.
[68:21.79]No.
[68:22.71]Use double spell.
[68:23.67]No.
[68:24.15]I can't.
[68:25.15]Drink the green potion.
[68:26.49]No, I can't.
[68:27.25]I can't do it.
[68:28.25]Mana charge speed.
[68:29.07]I can't do it.
[68:29.47]It's too much for my brain right now.
[68:30.89]It's a lot of info.
[68:31.69]I can't.
[68:32.89]I like what I have right now.
[68:35.06]This is perfect.
[68:36.42]Yes, you can.
[68:37.06]I can't do it.
[68:37.60]I can't.
[68:38.58]I can't do it.
[68:39.04]I just can't.
[68:40.02]It's too much.
[68:40.52]I like this.
[68:41.10]I'm going to keep it.
[68:45.44]Put laser on one and two.
[68:47.97]On...
[68:51.40]What do you mean 1 and 2?
[68:51.94]Stop saying no.
[68:56.46]Use it as artillery.
[68:58.08]It's okay.
[68:59.13]Put a manna in the water.
[69:01.01]Don't shoot electricity in the water.
[69:03.51]I like what I got right now.
[69:05.91]Actually, this thing sucks.
[69:07.74]I don't want this anymore.
[69:08.60]I want to make this better.
[69:21.86]Good for digging?
[69:22.62]Yeah, you know what it is.
[69:23.72]You're right.
[69:25.82]This is gonna be the dig weapon.
[69:30.98]Yeah, this is dig.
[69:33.02]Two lasers to dig.
[69:36.69]I like it.
[69:37.23]I'm ready.
[69:37.57]I'm good.
[69:39.67]This is my attack wand.
[69:42.43]And I have black hole for when I need to have an insane moment.
[69:45.41]Alright, let's go.
[69:49.18]He's too indecisive.
[69:51.50]I think it's less indecisive and more I still sort of have no idea what's going on.
[69:57.36]Gold is forever.
[70:00.22]More blood and gas fire.
[70:08.65]Gold is forever.
[70:09.39]What does that mean?
[70:12.83]Do I get to keep the gold through runs?
[70:16.64]Gold nuggets never disappear.
[70:18.28]Oh.
[70:18.94]Well, that's not what I wanted.
[70:30.55]This does so much damage if you can hit it.
[70:34.77]What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
[70:45.52]What happened?
[70:48.41]I thought that was a training dummy.
[70:50.25]That's not a training dummy.
[70:51.67]I thought that was a training dummy.
[70:52.71]What do you mean I angered the gods?
[70:56.83]I thought that was like a, hey, test out your new stuff on... That's not what that is?
[71:05.70]You trained too hard.
[71:09.02]That hurt a lot.
[71:10.18]He just point blanked him with a fucking grenade launcher.
[71:19.65]Snipe him from back here through the dirt.
[71:22.66]I beheaded the statue.
[71:24.44]I didn't know that was going to happen.
[71:25.44]I thought it was just a training dummy.
[71:27.48]Alright, get me in here.
[71:41.09]Whoa, alright, easy.
[71:43.56]Should I be eating people though?
[71:44.76]Should I eat people?
[71:48.79]Your stomach is almost... But what does that mean?
[71:50.95]What does eating people do?
[71:53.23]What is this percentage thing?
[71:54.15]What does it mean?
[71:54.53]It doesn't do anything.
[71:59.10]It does nothing.
[71:59.92]Okay, so why am I doing it?
[72:09.09]Cannibalism is wrong.
[72:10.15]It's not cannibalism.
[72:11.01]I'm... Wait, what do you mean cannibalism?
[72:17.18]Oh boy, this is where it gets a little- Black hole, black hole, black hole, black hole.
[72:22.68]It didn't- Black hole didn't do anything.
[72:27.79]What the fuck?
[72:28.67]What?
[72:31.27]Oh my god, I- Voice crack, worst one I've probably done in a long time.
[72:34.71]I'm dead.
[72:37.99]Goodbye.
[72:38.89]Uh, that was-
[72:45.59]I just got spawned on by like 40 people.
[72:54.23]Black hole is for digging.
[72:55.93]Why are they fighting each other?
[72:56.96]Oh my god!

[73:42.93]I want to play non-meme.
[73:45.27]I like this game.
[73:46.03]Ooh, we got a new wand.
[74:05.05]What do we got?

[74:07.13]Whatever it is, let's go.
[74:11.02]It's a double shot this game is shit install my mod So you think this game sucks, but you loved it enough to make a mod for it.
[74:21.23]What are you talking about?
[74:22.39]And things can crit
[74:38.41]What the?
[74:39.53]Okay, why is the water on fire?
[74:41.91]You can light the mud on fire.
[74:47.81]What are you protected by?
[74:48.69]Oh, we got a bunch of chumps in here that are about to get bombed from above.
[75:01.12]Burn!
[75:02.64]Burn!
[75:05.69]Whoa!
[75:07.51]Oh, right, you can't hover forever.
[75:08.61]Okay.
[75:17.82]Fall joke.
[75:18.38]Thank God there's no fall damage.
[75:19.56]That would have been sad.
[75:22.64]This guy fucking double tapped.
[75:24.78]That guy hit his head on the ceiling and died.
[75:27.18]What an embarrassment.
[75:28.18]I can't believe I let that guy kill me.
[75:30.66]Or hurt me, you know, whatever.
[75:35.85]This is fun.
[75:39.89]Bouncing Burst.
[75:42.53]Alright.
[75:43.39]I'm willing to try everything.
[75:44.55]I think I found the one I want to use.
[75:49.96]I'm pretty sure I found the one I like.
[75:51.22]This is awesome.
[76:00.76]What just exploded?
[76:04.57]Tabula Smaragdina.
[76:07.88]What is that?
[76:09.24]Pick up Tabula Smaragdina.
[76:10.82]Okay.
[76:18.34]Can somebody take out the NES cartridge and blow in it?
[76:20.98]Oh, wait.
[76:21.44]I can read it now.
[76:23.57]If all the mountains were of silver and gold, what would they profit?
[76:27.71]A man who lives in...
[76:37.52]Okay.
[76:38.84]If all... If all the mountains were of silver and gold, what would they profit a man who lives in a constant fear of death?
[76:46.14]Hence, there cannot be in the whole world anything better than our medicine, which has the power to heal all the diseases of the flesh.
[76:54.66]Eat it?
[77:02.70]Swamp potion.
[77:06.57]Quip and throw.
[77:07.87]Swamp potion.
[77:12.43]Food poisoning.
[77:23.12]Whoa, what's that?
[77:45.25]How much more?
[77:46.37]Did I just screw myself?
[77:55.49]Keep going.
[77:57.23]I don't have enough potion to keep going.
[78:08.83]I made it.
[78:09.21]Okay, what the hell is over here?
[78:10.90]It's got to be like a treasure chest over here.
[78:13.12]It has to be.
[78:17.22]Guaranteed treasure chest down here.
[78:18.64]Uh.
[78:29.96]Okay.
[78:36.22]Uh.
[78:37.98]Entered the orb room.
[78:41.32]Oh, there's a magical sacred orb over here.
[78:43.86]And another scroll of poison.
[78:50.56]Okay, I picked up the other tablet.
[78:56.31]Among those who devote themselves to the transmutation of metals, however, there can be no such thing as mediocrity of attainment.
[79:04.59]A person who studies this art must have either everything or nothing.
[79:07.85]An alchemist, who knows only half of their craft, reaps nothing but disappointment and waste of time and money.
[79:13.24]Moreover,
[79:14.22]They lay themselves upon to the mockery of those who despise our art.
[79:18.34]Those indeed who succeed in research reaching the... Hold on.
[79:23.92]I'm like drunk reading.
[79:26.36]Okay, when you get like a drunk text and you're drunk, it's like, what did you just say?
[79:29.85]Hey, where are you?
[79:31.99]Why are you not in the hotel room?
[79:34.31]I don't know.
[79:36.81]Thus, those indeed who succeed in reaching the goal of the Magistry, have not only infinite riches, but the means of continued li- Am I- Did I just go down, like, the lore path?
[79:46.85]Where you collect, like, four of these, and it turns into a fucking demon?
[79:53.65]First, you need to pick up an orb.
[79:54.59]You've discovered an orb of true knowledge.
[80:06.17]Picked up Thunder Cloud 5.
[80:07.39]Creates a stormy cloud.
[80:14.19]Holy, that seems pretty good.
[80:21.78]I unlocked a new spell?
[80:22.70]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[80:27.80]Alright, let's go.
[80:28.36]Fill your water bottle.
[80:35.00]Can I do that?
[80:37.32]Oh, you can.
[80:41.91]I swear to fucking God, I have no idea what's wrong.
[80:44.93]I didn't mean to do that.
[80:55.84]Kill!
[80:56.94]Kill!
[80:57.60]You took my orb, right?
[81:06.68]Okay, that was fun.
[81:09.18]Is that like the last boss or something?
[81:14.72]This is probably the last boss.
[81:21.79]Hold on a second, but I unlocked the new spell.
[81:26.37]Where is it?
[81:28.78]Where is it?
[81:29.44]I unlocked it.
[81:34.42]Where is it?
[81:38.97]It's the last boss's room, son.
[81:43.77]I have to screw this more.
[81:45.37]Okay.
[81:45.67]It's still not here.
[81:49.26]It was like storm cloud, right?
[81:54.60]You have to use it to make it show up.
[81:58.64]Oh.
[82:00.98]Alright, let's go.
[82:01.64]Come on.
[82:04.96]Didn't cast it.
[82:06.02]Oh.
[82:06.46]Does that mean I didn't unlock it, though?
[82:07.68]Or does it still unlock?
[82:08.58]I don't have to do all that bullshit again, do I?
[82:12.66]Integrate us.
[82:13.20]No!
[82:13.36]Alright, I have a question for those of you that want me to do Twitch integration.
[82:21.02]Can I just type in my channel name?
[82:22.62]Or do I have to go through a major process and install a bunch of shit?
[82:25.40]Or can I just type my name in?
[82:26.34]Go left.
[82:28.01]Hold on.
[82:31.77]Just channel name.
[82:32.49]Just type your name.
[82:33.29]Okay.
[82:41.36]You have to post dick pics.
[82:56.08]That's like... That's of the same level of... Like, give me 5 BTC and I send you 10 BTC scams.
[83:08.80]In fact, that may even be worse.
[83:14.84]Uh, what's the point of going over here?
[83:22.39]Throw a bomb in here.
[83:23.11]Alright.
[83:29.34]Well, now what?
[83:32.98]It's just water.
[83:33.58]Give me some air.
[83:38.12]Give me some air.
[83:50.36]Oh shit, another scroll!
[83:53.46]Oh no!
[83:53.84]I can't wait to summon that monster again!
[83:58.97]Sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge is the highest level of... There's a mutant in here.
[84:03.81]Fuck.
[84:25.12]I'll kill him.
[84:26.36]This is the final boss.
[84:27.34]That would be pretty disappointing.
[84:29.40]This is just Terraria.
[84:30.78]Yes, it is.
[84:32.26]But it's more custom.
[84:34.34]Okay.
[84:35.44]You guys remember the game Magicka?
[84:41.49]This is Magicka and Terraria together.
[84:47.36]And I remember they made another Magicka.
[84:49.42]Where they had this awesome, incredibly fun video game.
[84:52.58]Where you combine spells and could play with your friends.
[84:55.32]And then they made another Magicka.
[84:57.41]And then I died, apparently, because I ran out of oxygen.
[85:01.61]That didn't happen like that, in that order.
[85:05.59]What?
[85:05.75]Yeah, I remember that, too.
[85:11.29]Point is, they took that franchise and threw it in the trash.
[85:17.41]If they had just expanded on Magicka 1 instead of making like a multiplayer fighter game.
[85:22.17]That could have been such a great franchise.
[85:29.47]Oh, I'm not going left again.
[85:32.78]Oh, you guys want to get integrated?
[85:34.18]Then I'm going to play the way I want to play.
[85:38.02]Okay?
[85:38.30]Silence.
[85:40.86]Demanded.
[85:43.18]You guys want to get Twitch integration?
[85:44.96]Then I'm going to play the way that I want to play.
[85:51.77]Ooh.
[85:52.51]A steel potion.
[85:53.87]What is this called?
[85:54.35]Stamina potion?
[85:55.81]A slime potion.
[85:57.31]Cool.
[85:57.95]I still don't understand anything.
[86:00.98]He's a tyrant.
[86:05.16]Kind of.
[86:09.48]I'm glad I started with a bubble wand.
[86:10.82]I like these the best.
[86:15.12]How many floors are there?
[86:17.38]I got to snow floor and then I got overwhelmed.
[86:20.92]How many actual floors are there?
[86:21.96]This game's really fun.
[86:27.90]Seven.
[86:28.92]Where did I get to?
[86:29.62]Four?
[86:30.12]Five?
[86:32.48]Holy shit, this guy is unkillable.
[86:36.04]I got to four, okay.
[86:42.75]Five?
[86:43.37]Oh.
[86:54.55]I don't know what they said, but somebody said I'm willing to be perma-banned for this.
[86:57.05]Well, I guess enjoy your perma-band, whatever you said.
[86:59.57]I don't know what it was.
[87:00.97]Have a nice day.
[87:07.13]I don't even know.
[87:08.09]That's the first thing.
[87:12.22]I don't even know what he said.
[87:13.36]I can't even read it.
[87:14.04]It should be about seven floors.
[87:23.96]What does it say?
[87:24.36]Okay.
[87:25.22]Jerma, I'm willing to bet a permaban on you liking Jedi Academy because it's like Dark Messiah.
[87:32.92]Well, why would I permaban you if I don't like a game you suggested?
[87:35.66]Isn't that kind of weird?
[87:36.98]I didn't like that game.
[87:40.31]Ban that person forever.
[87:41.49]Can I dig?
[87:42.81]Can I try to go down to the center?
[87:51.27]Something in the bottom here?
[87:56.07]Okay, well that was, what happened?
[87:58.95]Twitch chat is full of nerds.
[88:02.99]Well, that's, I mean, it's true.
[88:05.82]Aren't you one of them?
[88:07.38]I'm one of them.
[88:08.98]We're all totally nerds here now.
[88:14.66]I'm getting a lot of really hard enemy spawns, don't you think?
[88:18.26]It's like, what the fuck is that all about?
[88:19.68]I'm like dead.
[88:24.31]I don't have enough money for anything.
[88:25.09]No, I'm not going in yet.
[88:25.85]I want more money.
[88:30.45]The menu sounds like Taco Bell.
[88:40.58]Get out of here.
[88:43.68]Crunchwrap Supreme.
[88:45.64]Only $2.99 with our box combo.
[88:48.30]Come to the bell.
[88:50.55]You fucking asshole.
[88:52.85]That doesn't make you an asshole.
[88:54.11]What's wrong with me?
[88:55.93]That's so fucking funny.
[88:57.63]Just go.
[88:58.13]I'm going.
[88:58.65]Remember, don't shoot his head off.
[89:04.22]Please mod me.
[89:07.94]Wait, something's hidden down here.
[89:09.16]Is this free?
[89:09.72]Okay.
[89:18.93]Uh, I can't get that.
[89:20.35]There's a fish in here.
[89:24.11]Can I touch the fish?
[89:26.78]Catch the fish?
[89:39.40]What does it say?
[89:40.65]Meat of an innocent creature.
[89:42.23]Ooh.
[89:47.39]Oops.
[89:53.56]Sorry about that.
[89:59.23]I didn't know.
[89:59.67]I thought it was like a magic fish.
[90:00.69]Okay.
[90:01.91]Fireball.
[90:03.75]I kind of want fireball.
[90:05.55]Bouncing burst.
[90:06.89]Glitter bomb.
[90:07.73]Wait.
[90:08.91]Chainsaw.
[90:09.65]Glitter bomb.
[90:11.35]Chainsaw.
[90:11.72]I can get both.
[90:14.68]No, I can't.
[90:20.34]Good tool for cutting meat.
[90:21.50]Also has some magical properties.
[90:25.01]Painsaw bubble?
[90:37.32]How does it work?
[90:50.87]Oh!
[90:53.95]That's kind of cool.
[90:59.13]Chainsaw on two.
[90:59.97]Alright, so what about this one?
[91:00.93]Should I get a bouncing burst?
[91:04.35]I might as well.
[91:04.93]Alright, let's see.
[91:05.75]Bouncing burst and... Yeah, let's do this.
[91:15.20]That works for me.
[91:24.63]Bounce on two.
[91:25.31]Bounce on two.
[91:25.97]Bounce on two.
[91:26.57]Yeah, but then I don't have a chainsaw anymore.
[91:32.74]I mean, what, you want me to chainsaw on one?
[91:34.36]Bounce on two.
[91:35.76]Okay, that's pretty good.
[91:43.98]It's so bad on mana recharge, though.
[91:48.58]Recharge time.
[91:49.24]Mana charge speed six.
[91:50.78]That's terrible.
[91:52.88]Six?
[91:55.09]That's bad.
[91:56.91]That's bad.
[91:57.79]I'd rather have it like this.
[92:02.30]Yeah, this is more consistent.
[92:05.53]This is the chainsaw, and I can just dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
[92:07.75]Can I dig down here?
[92:16.63]I can't... Yeah, I can, but whatever.
[92:18.23]Alright, cool, let's go.
[92:25.88]Enemy radar.
[92:26.64]Freeze field.
[92:29.76]Wand radar.
[92:34.52]Hey Jeremy, I have a bit of a long message, but I've been a long time viewer.
[92:36.70]Just a quick question, how many people have you killed?
[92:39.60]Um... Zero.
[92:42.50]Thanks for the- I really thought I had something there.
[92:46.29]Okay.
[92:46.53]Uh... Wand radar.
[92:51.73]Is that- what, does something show up on a mini-map or something?
[92:55.23]Freeze field.
[92:56.13]I'm gonna do- I- I'm- Freeze field.
[92:57.89]Liquids freeze in your presence.
[93:01.59]That kind of feels like it sucks.
[93:12.20]Alright, let's move.
[93:15.64]Did I anger him again?
[93:16.48]I didn't even do anything.
[93:18.06]Liquids freeze in your presence.
[93:23.04]Wait, does this do this to lava too?
[93:25.28]If it does, that's pretty good.
[93:26.11]We'll make a little Star Wars cringe post.
[93:29.93]Because somebody said they want me to play Star Wars Jedi Academy.
[93:37.03]Star Wars cringe post.
[93:39.01]Oh, dig that out.
[93:39.69]That's gold.
[93:48.17]Take that out.
[93:48.63]Am I destroying it?
[94:03.58]Am I destroying it?
[94:06.66]Okay, no.
[94:07.11]I was going to say, why?
[94:07.81]It sounds like...
[94:13.34]Alright, I need a much bigger recharge for this one.
[94:17.16]I gotta find a recharge rate for the chainsaw.
[94:19.28]Come on, dude.
[94:19.88]Seriously.
[94:21.08]That's just terrible.
[94:21.84]It's just awful.
[94:22.48]Let's be honest.
[94:27.39]I'm gonna sneak this way, though.
[94:29.79]Probably something down here.
[94:37.21]Gold over there, too.
[94:38.47]Gold everywhere!
[94:41.55]Hold on.
[94:42.01]I gotta stick around for a minute.
[94:42.93]Hold on.
[94:59.88]Is this worth it?
[95:00.36]How much gold do you get?
[95:01.10]You don't get one.
[95:13.77]I feel like I'm doing the thing in Worms that everybody hates.
[95:17.05]When you just take one of your Worms and you just continue to drill down and just stay safe the whole time.
[95:26.32]Oh, is it my turn?
[95:27.60]Okay.
[95:31.52]I love playing this game with my friends.
[95:36.41]That's worth it.
[95:36.91]That's 100.
[95:37.11]That was like 40 gold.
[95:41.39]And then somebody finally gets, like, right there.
[95:43.69]You're, like, fucking down here.
[95:46.01]They just, like, throw, like, a... What?
[95:48.15]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[95:50.43]Hallelujah.
[96:00.62]He knows?
[96:01.34]Who doesn't know?
[96:01.96]That's, like, one of the most classic franchises ever.
[96:05.08]I know.
[96:16.63]It's a recharge faster if you don't look at it.
[96:22.56]There is a holy hand grenade in this?
[96:26.96]Are they still making worms games?
[96:31.64]I'm starting to get like the urge to play one.
[96:35.33]But not like a new age worms game.
[96:37.71]Like worms.
[96:38.57]Like original.
[96:39.11]Like worms 2.
[96:40.87]Worms Armageddon.
[96:44.62]This is a complete just pulling this out of my ass completely, but I feel like Worms is one of those franchises that would potentially be trying to modernize too much.
[96:54.07]And the game is not even close to as fun as it was before.
[96:55.93]Is that true?
[97:00.87]I have no idea.
[97:01.73]I'm making that up.
[97:02.49]I don't know, but I just feel like it could be.
[97:11.91]That game seems very iPad-able.
[97:15.37]Right?
[97:16.29]It does.
[97:18.95]Worms Mobile!
[97:21.62]And that's just all they have.
[97:25.26]Look, that's a huge chunk right there.
[97:26.52]I have to at least get that one.
[97:33.58]Is that the guy that plays iPad games?
[97:36.29]Yeah.
[97:36.89]Now I have...
[97:39.02]You know, um, E3, I know that people are going to laugh at this, maybe I've already told this story, but E3, like 2013, um, Star and I shared a hotel room together.
[97:53.05]And I was in the middle of playing Family Guy, the Family Guy, the quest for stuff.
[98:02.75]And Star was just sitting in the bed over next to me.
[98:07.61]Watching me just tap on the iPad.
[98:10.65]And like collecting coins.
[98:11.95]I had a town that was huge.
[98:16.38]It was like rivaled the best towns in the whole game.
[98:20.26]I had every character.
[98:21.32]I had Quagmire.
[98:22.14]I had Lois.
[98:23.16]I had Stewie.
[98:23.90]I had Peter.
[98:25.00]I had Professor Xavier.
[98:27.50]Whatever the guy's name is.
[98:28.50]I had all of them.
[98:30.74]And I'm going to be honest with you, I have to be honest with you because I hope that I am.
[98:34.36]I spent at least, and I'm being completely real and I hate to say this out loud, at least $100 on that game.
[98:40.58]I swear to God.
[98:41.38]At least $100.
[98:42.97]It probably was like $200.
[98:46.11]Over the course of like five months of me caring about it.
[98:49.21]I don't know why.
[98:49.69]I didn't even care.
[98:50.41]I spent at least $100 on that game.
[98:58.35]And I don't even like Family Guy that much.
[99:00.97]I don't even care.
[99:02.71]But that was right when those started becoming a thing.
[99:06.55]Like, collect coins from your buildings and wait.
[99:11.99]2012, 2013, that was when it first started.
[99:13.81]And then I figured it out.
[99:14.72]And I was like, alright, that's fucking stupid.
[99:16.26]I'm never doing that again.
[99:17.08]And then I bought like 1,400 Hearthstone cards over the course of a couple of years.
[99:21.74]It just never stopped.
[99:22.82]They just continued to do that formula in a few different other ways.
[99:32.50]It got to a point where I was buying Hearthstone cards just to buy them.
[99:37.67]And I didn't even... I was terrible.
[99:39.59]I was so bad at the game.
[99:42.19]I had no idea what the meta was.
[99:43.51]I was fucking awful at it.
[99:45.21]But everybody was playing it and I was like, I want Grom Hellscream 2.
[99:49.31]Because it is a Grom deck.
[99:53.97]Stars told this story before.
[99:55.33]Back when Hearthstone was in its beta and they were giving closed out keys to streamers and shit, I went into a bunch of people's channels with alt accounts and tried to win key giveaways.
[100:07.66]I would sit in a street because people were doing like, oh, beta key giveaway!
[100:10.52]So I'd try to find streams that I had a good chance to win.
[100:13.78]And I was just sitting there and I'd wait for a fucking beta key.
[100:18.84]Here we go, we're giving another two or three keys!
[100:20.82]And I'm like, oh, yeah, okay, hold on, me too.
[100:23.56]Give me one.
[100:23.98]These are confessions.
[100:27.98]I mean, I'm serious.
[100:31.23]Did I get one?
[100:31.89]No, I didn't.
[100:33.55]Alright, I have to remember the validity of this.
[100:41.07]Because I think Star got a key for me somehow.
[100:50.46]I think he, like, found one.
[100:51.94]Or he got it and he gave it to me.
[100:53.84]I don't even remember.
[100:54.58]He found one.
[101:02.74]I don't even, like, remember how.
[101:07.22]I was so obsessed.
[101:08.40]I was like, I need to play this so bad.
[101:10.06]Please, anything.
[101:12.58]And then I got it and I didn't play it.
[101:15.81]I played it for, like, a week or two.
[101:17.17]And I was like, I'm not good at this.
[101:18.15]I hate this.
[101:19.63]I suck at this.
[101:32.61]Money wasted.
[101:37.09]I'm so desperate to play it.
[101:39.15]I wanted it so bad.
[101:51.36]Alright, that's enough gold.
[101:52.22]Yeah, I wanted like 300.
[101:55.78]Good thing to know that our donation is being pumped into Family Guy.
[101:59.40]Then I don't- you think I still play that?
[102:01.72]It's been like seven years.
[102:20.80]Die already!
[102:23.48]No!
[102:23.78]The money!
[102:26.53]No, I can't get that money either.
[102:31.44]Stream your Family Guy, Tom.
[102:47.44]Oh my god.
[102:48.42]I have no juice left.
[102:49.12]I'm dead.
[102:49.36]I went down way too quick.
[102:50.36]Terrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.
[102:56.24]I'm okay.
[102:59.00]Worms. Do the worms strategy.
[103:21.97]No, stop coming up here.
[103:31.02]We want Family Guy.
[103:32.22]No, I don't want to play that.
[103:33.48]That game sucks.
[103:36.80]It is the worst of all the worst potential of iPad just money grab games.
[103:44.81]I don't want to play that.
[103:45.89]You don't want to see that happen.
[103:52.68]Okay, I get the 350.
[103:53.50]No, I need, I need, something's gonna cost 350 and I'm gonna be pissed that I didn't do this.
[104:05.14]Come on.
[104:08.70]This one's closer.
[104:14.04]Alright, I got it.
[104:14.84]Let's go.
[104:16.42]You can't ignore this.
[104:17.79]I don't even know if the game exists anymore.
[104:23.42]Hey, Lois.
[104:28.34]Get a load of this guy.
[104:30.06]I don't even think the game exists.
[104:36.08]How come there's been no wands here?
[104:37.18]This is 50% off.
[104:39.22]Prickly Spore Pod.
[104:42.24]Oh, here it is.
[104:45.80]Undercloud.
[104:46.32]Should I try it?
[104:48.91]Can't ignore this.
[104:49.81]Hold on.
[104:50.23]What are you linking?
[104:57.52]So stupid.
[104:59.06]This is like zero effort, but it's somehow a lot of effort, but at the same time, it's fucking zero effort too.
[105:13.39]Not that.
[105:14.35]Hold on.
[105:19.48]But did that just say to my documents?
[105:21.36]Why did I...
[105:27.45]Save image as on desktop.
[105:31.10]Why is this not saving?
[105:39.05]Oh, no.
[105:39.51]Get the file name off there, dude.
[105:42.07]Oh, here we go.
[105:54.01]Zero effort.
[105:56.31]I think I like Meg the most.
[106:05.83]From the time that I said the word Family Guy iPad game.
[106:10.17]One of you started immediately.
[106:11.59]You started right then.
[106:13.28]And you finished two minutes ago and uploaded it.
[106:15.42]Alright, what do I want?
[106:26.03]I want the, I want the thunder.
[106:27.75]I want to try it.
[106:28.23]I unlocked it.
[106:30.11]Blood is 250.
[106:31.39]Wait, everything is 50% off.
[106:34.45]Oh no, it's not.
[106:40.45]Just blood?
[106:43.35]What should I get?
[106:45.11]Chunk of soil.
[106:46.79]Personal gravity field.
[106:50.30]Second wand is machine gun.
[106:54.91]Uh, blood.
[106:57.63]And spore.
[106:58.69]There's another one.
[107:01.17]Alright, well we might as well get these out of the way.
[107:02.39]I don't know what this has to do with Family Guy, but, um... What does this have to do with Family Guy?
[107:17.88]We're on like a Family Guy kick right now.
[107:19.38]Does this have to do with Family Guy?
[107:29.29]That's a real face?
[107:33.81]I mean, it kind of looks fake.
[107:38.38]It looks a little bit fake.
[107:48.22]So handsome.
[107:50.34]Okay.
[107:55.54]Thanks, mom.
[107:57.12]Yeah.
[107:58.50]Thanks a lot, Mom, for saying that.
[108:05.58]Real Link, please.
[108:10.94]Alright, I'm going back to play Noita.
[108:17.64]So... Why did you... What did you do to my face?
[108:24.62]Why did you do that to my face?
[108:26.91]I don't understand what the point of this was.
[108:31.97]Why did you arch my back a little and give me a weird chin?
[108:35.62]I don't understand.
[108:41.98]You clicked the wrong one again.
[108:43.40]Okay, this is way better.
[108:52.99]I don't know.
[108:53.93]This could be real.
[109:05.70]Somebody said the missing link.
[109:10.70]It's not real.
[109:11.52]I don't think it is.
[109:12.30]It's just old man body.
[109:23.61]All old men over the age of like 85.
[109:25.09]This is terrible.
[109:35.58]But you put like a crispy filter on it, though.
[109:37.26]That makes it look a little worse, right?
[109:44.50]Escape from Dinosaur Island.
[109:47.78]I don't... I'm not gonna play this.
[109:48.86]What do you want me to do?
[109:49.40]I'm not playing that right now.
[109:51.92]Yeah, I've seen the toilet mouth one.
[109:55.24]Alright.
[109:56.02]This is it.
[109:56.54]Last link and I'm done with links.
[110:00.56]Okay, yeah.
[110:01.68]This is good, too.
[110:08.73]This is your camera.
[110:09.67]I know the camera sucks.
[110:10.73]I know.
[110:21.34]We've seen this one too.
[110:24.68]What is this umbrella?
[110:27.10]What is that?
[110:30.34]Why is there like a weird... Oh, that's the weird studio lights that I used to have.
[110:34.18]What is it doing in the room?
[110:35.08]What's it doing in here?
[110:40.07]Dude, this office was as big as an airplane bathroom.
[110:43.23]What was this for?
[110:44.01]A light gun stream?
[110:54.74]But why would I have that?
[110:55.84]Jim Carrey on set for The Grinch.
[111:00.72]Well, I'm not green, so sorry about that.
[111:11.43]You know, the things that, like, you... The things that you're remembered for, and the things, like, the legacy you leave behind.
[111:16.89]Gonna be a real lot of digging to find that for me.
[111:20.92]You're gonna have to really do a lot of, uh, weeding around.
[111:44.47]Now, let me tell you about the stimulus.
[111:48.39]We are not ready to move forward on a stimulus.
[111:54.13]Not yet.
[111:54.99]Maybe soon we will move forward on that.
[111:57.79]Madam Speaker.
[112:02.89]Paul McCartney.
[112:03.83]I think Paul McCartney is closer.
[112:13.52]Wrinkly asshole.
[112:17.75]Tony Hawk?
[112:19.25]Okay, I'm done.
[112:20.57]I'm done.
[112:20.99]I'm done.
[112:21.35]I'm done.
[112:22.33]I'm done.
[112:22.75]I'm done.
[112:23.13]I'm done.
[112:23.39]I'm going back to playing Noito.
[112:27.47]It was in all caps.
[112:28.82]Alright.
[112:31.74]Stop it.
[112:32.24]Enough.
[112:33.08]Silence.
[112:39.11]Do the spells.
[112:39.99]Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[112:41.11]We're playing a video game again.
[112:42.43]Alright, this just creates a stormy cloud.
[112:45.89]I need the third wand.
[112:46.85]This is kind of bad.
[112:48.73]Summons a spore pod.
[112:49.79]Let's just, I just want to see what it looks like individually.
[112:54.70]What am I doing?
[112:55.16]Alright, what does this do?
[112:58.98]Whoa, whoa!
[112:59.98]Does it hurt me?
[113:04.14]Did this explode?
[113:05.00]Does the projectile hurt me?
[113:07.22]Very important.
[113:10.96]They do.
[113:11.34]The projectile hurts me.
[113:12.78]So, um, it is being removed.
[113:17.10]Blood.
[113:18.34]Blood, blood, blood.
[113:19.40]Okay.
[113:19.72]Uh, so what, you just can cast blood on yourself?
[113:23.12]Thundercloud.
[113:24.62]This only has... Okay, move.
[113:30.10]I can't move.
[113:30.58]Move, please!
[113:41.58]Why did I get stuck?
[113:43.44]Because you froze the rain.
[113:47.80]You were standing in the rain and you froze inside the rain.
[114:06.32]I was here.
[114:07.10]Okay.
[114:08.56]Alright, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[114:09.86]I'm like into this game.
[114:11.26]I need to get to at least floor five again.
[114:14.36]Integrate, no.
[114:17.28]Oh, and if you keep asking for it, I'm not going to turn it on.
[114:24.16]I will do Twitch integration after this.
[114:28.26]You understand?
[114:33.65]If you do the integration, I will subscribe.
[114:35.17]Okay, fucking hurry up.
[114:37.21]Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[114:54.77]I subbed.
[114:55.19]What the fuck?
[114:55.75]I subbed.
[114:59.47]I need to get down to... I have to get down to at least the floor.
[115:03.01]Snow floor.
[115:07.28]Respect our existence.
[115:08.20]What are you doing?
[115:09.40]I am.
[115:09.98]Just wait.
[115:11.16]I'm getting more comfortable in the game.
[115:12.44]I'm starting to understand how the game works.
[115:17.48]It's becoming very clear what I need to do and where I need to go.
[115:24.69]Blow this up so I can get down there in a quick manner.
[115:28.33]Where's the gold?
[115:31.41]There it is.
[115:41.08]Uh, my favorite slot machine is where's the gold?
[115:43.88]By the way, if you want to know more lore, more confessions.
[115:52.96]Blow up, please.
[115:57.76]I thought it was Betty White.
[115:58.76]Yeah, Betty White isn't very good to me.
[116:00.78]I'll tell you.
[116:01.22]Betty White wasn't very good to me lately.
[116:04.92]I haven't been... Okay, let me be clear about this.
[116:07.74]I haven't, like, been to the casino to play casino games since, like, January of 2020.
[116:13.09]So, let's be clear about that first of all.
[116:15.37]Alright, who just gave $50 to say Banana Bro Integration?
[116:30.99]This year.
[116:31.97]Yeah.
[116:32.81]Um, like, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November.
[116:39.51]Yeah, so, yes, I went to the casino ten months ago and hung out for a little while.
[116:46.64]Look out!
[116:47.16]Alright, I'm gonna die, so don't make fun of me yet.
[116:54.24]And yeah, why would I want to go to a casino and, like, hang around there?
[116:56.92]Um, no thanks.
[117:04.97]It's not blood.
[117:09.26]Go right.
[117:09.72]Go right.
[117:10.08]Go right.
[117:10.66]I'm just taking a look.
[117:12.96]I'm not picking that up.
[117:13.70]It's going to spawn like this worm boss.
[117:15.16]I already did this.
[117:21.99]Who gave the $50?
[117:22.41]I missed it.
[117:22.83]It was 5,000 bits from... Who was it?
[117:24.13]Who gave it?
[117:32.52]It was me.
[117:33.12]No, it wasn't.
[117:33.48]Who was it?
[117:34.96]They say Banana Bros, like Unite or something.
[117:37.10]Whatever they said.
[117:37.82]It was a lot of money.
[117:39.15]Wait, hold on a second.
[117:40.01]Let me see.
[117:42.95]I'm sure a lot of these things saved.
[117:44.21]Alright, it was Zurich Da.
[117:50.60]Zurich Da.
[117:51.60]Thanks, Zurich.
[118:00.37]I'm just going to put this on screen for a second because I don't understand what this is.
[118:05.87]Why, uh... Why did you just link this to me?
[118:19.64]What's this supposed to be conveying?
[118:26.59]True.
[118:33.04]Spoilers?
[118:33.80]A guy throws another guy to the ground?
[118:39.13]That happens in like 8 out of 10 movies that have ever released.
[118:51.86]What were we doing?
[118:53.64]Something was happening.
[118:54.58]What happened?
[118:55.34]There was a reason why I stopped.
[118:56.40]What did I stop for?
[118:58.72]What did I stop for?
[118:59.34]There was a reason why I stopped.
[119:03.24]No, it wasn't for Twitch integration.
[119:07.02]Oh, yeah, the donation.
[119:08.31]Okay, we got it.
[119:10.33]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[119:11.23]It's a lot of money.
[119:16.51]And I'll tell you.
[119:18.67]You want to support the channel?
[119:21.57]You don't got to give me 50 bucks.
[119:23.33]You don't got to give me 5,000 bits.
[119:25.97]I actually probably would prefer if you just subbed.
[119:30.91]You know, people give so much money to this stream, it's un-fucking-believable.
[119:36.75]People have given thousands of dollars to this stream.
[119:39.61]Thousands.
[119:40.19]And I can't even comprehend how much money that is.
[119:49.09]Ungrateful.
[119:49.73]No, no, I'm just saying, I... This channel sees so much support and so much money already.
[120:02.00]That people dropping hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month.
[120:07.14]It's a lot of fucking money.
[120:08.20]And I don't want to seem like I'm ungrateful for it, but... Then integrate us already.
[120:15.75]I'm gonna.
[120:22.21]You missed subs.
[120:23.35]Oh, they just came in right now.
[120:24.47]Zurich, duh, gave 10 community subs.
[120:27.75]On top of the 50 dollars.
[120:32.20]And Chrissy just gave five community subs.
[120:36.94]Thank you, both of you.
[120:40.20]DestroyDude gave five community subs as well.
[120:43.44]Alright, let's talk about this for just a second.
[120:45.46]So, one of the reasons why, on top of the fact that I can stay here and stream longer and not do the end of the stream reading donation thing, there's been a lot less bit donations, right?
[120:57.38]Because I don't read them anymore.
[120:59.75]And like a small portion of the reason why to do that is not just because of being able to sit here for longer with the pain problems that I have, but also, people that give this channel a shitload of money, I would much prefer it if you maybe spent less on me and more on you.
[121:23.56]I know that some people can afford it, and I know there are some people that watch this channel that probably have fucking millions of dollars, and that's awesome.
[121:31.28]But I would much prefer it if you spent that money on yourself.
[121:35.82]Put me at the bottom of your list.
[121:39.16]You guys take such good fucking care of me already.
[121:42.73]Like, it's unimaginable how much monetary support just from subscriptions come into this channel.
[121:49.09]You guys can do back of the napkin math.
[121:52.88]You know how many people are subbed to this channel.
[121:54.58]It's not public information.
[121:57.88]So just be aware that I, although I do, like, I do love that people give me that kind of money.
[122:06.97]I really hope that you're taking care of yourself first.
[122:10.53]And only have me at the end of your list.
[122:13.47]Always.
[122:19.90]He's begging for subs again.
[122:22.80]Please!
[122:23.62]Please just give me subs!
[122:24.76]That's all I want!
[122:27.51]Makes 3 billion- No, what's- what was it, the- if you look at the- Why, like, streamer net worth is like 140 billion dollars, right?
[122:40.14]It's something insane.
[122:43.00]Somebody linked the website.
[122:44.22]It says I'm- my net worth is like 180 billion dollars.
[122:48.78]Somebody linked it to me, like, a few months ago.
[122:53.22]And there are a lot of people saying, like, oh, wow, this is so wholesome.
[122:55.80]I- wow, this is so wholesome of you.
[122:58.81]I make a lot of fucking money.
[123:01.45]You know?
[123:02.37]Like, I just... I'm not necessarily refusing the money.
[123:09.79]But you guys know, like, this... We crossed 10,000 subs back... I don't have that now, but we did that back in January.
[123:19.06]That's absurd.
[123:20.14]That's an absurd amount of fucking money to give somebody.
[123:25.38]And I don't want people to think that they have to give me like a hundred bucks on top of that.
[123:31.78]It's already a huge amount that I can't even comprehend people would do in the first place.
[123:39.99]Get on with the fucking game.
[123:47.81]I just want to make it clear.
[123:48.87]Because a lot of people were, like, upset that I got rid of the reading of the donations.
[123:54.39]And I can understand that.
[123:56.72]But there's another part to that, right?
[123:59.38]Alright, I'm going to get on with the game.
[124:00.74]I'm going to get on with the game.
[124:01.42]Just know that, like, you guys take already fucking insane good care of me.
[124:05.12]With subscriptions alone.
[124:06.34]It's insane.
[124:08.27]So I'm going to get on.
[124:08.91]That guy was a new viewer, and I don't want him to think I'm an asshole.
[124:12.31]So I'm going to keep going.
[124:17.16]We gotta, like, we gotta get the new viewers to stay.
[124:22.34]Destroy the tablet, quick.
[124:37.13]Did I destroy it?
[124:40.95]What does it say I'm worth?
[124:45.39]And the point of me saying that this channel makes a lot of money is not to brag.
[124:48.74]It's to tell you that I don't... That if you want to give a thousand dollars to this channel in two weeks, take care of yourself first, always.
[124:59.80]I am last on that list.
[125:10.47]Still flexing.
[125:11.97]Yeah.
[125:15.14]No, dude, come on.
[125:19.95]Devil X just gave $50, 5,000 bits, and they say for our end of the list Andy.
[125:26.25]Okay, thank you.
[125:35.12]End of the list Andy.
[125:36.64]Thanks for the fucking insane amount of money.
[125:46.11]Stop doing the permaban bet on Jedi Academy.
[125:48.37]I'm going to play it like next week or something.
[125:50.03]I don't have enough money to do anything.
[125:59.27]Don't kill that fish.
[126:00.99]Alright, let's go.
[126:03.85]Millionaire streamer can't afford anything.
[126:09.93]Hey, what is this doing?
[126:14.46]Well, I can't tell you with confidence.
[126:16.04]I can't tell you with confidence I'm not a millionaire.
[126:17.84]Let's make that clear.
[126:19.09]I am not a millionaire.
[126:20.65]Not even close.
[126:23.97]Oh, extra wand capacity.
[126:31.95]If you had to be there, you know.
[126:36.78]If I had a billion dollars, I would open up like 30 clown schools across the country and make clowns cool again.
[126:42.20]That's what I would do.
[126:45.76]Peace with gods.
[126:51.98]High mana, low capacity.
[126:55.25]Wait.
[126:55.99]Maybe that one.
[127:02.07]Clowns cool again.
[127:04.15]Yeah, clowns were cool in like the fucking 1400s.
[127:07.15]Like the 1200s or something when it was like... Weren't they cool back in like the medieval times?
[127:13.13]Like jesters?
[127:16.70]Yeah, jesters were cool.
[127:17.62]What are you talking about?
[127:22.71]People liked the jester.
[127:28.75]I'm gonna go with this one.
[127:30.67]You make peace with your gods.
[127:31.81]I don't know what that means.
[127:33.05]People hated the jester.
[127:34.11]No, they didn't.
[127:34.64]It was like the king's right-hand man.
[127:36.28]Like, jester, come and spend time with me.
[127:39.80]And he'd come out and dance and they'd all be happy.
[127:42.76]It was the king's, like, favorite person.
[127:45.66]Clowns were cool when jesters were cool.
[127:47.98]They were the clowns.
[127:48.98]I want to get that back.
[127:51.58]It's coping.
[127:52.38]Whatever.
[127:55.92]They helped with like policy decisions too, didn't they?
[128:08.53]And if this song wasn't good enough, then they were like fed to a bunch of lions.
[128:17.85]Just like, you know, Twitch chat.
[128:19.53]If my joke's not good enough, you guys scream at me and tell me I'm just ugly.
[128:30.56]True.
[128:36.64]I just got point blank shotgun in the face.
[128:41.38]Come on.
[128:50.50]The guys with the guns are the worst.
[128:51.88]They're so accurate.
[128:52.60]They're way too accurate.
[128:56.65]I want that gold.
[128:58.93]Oh, fuck you.
[129:00.67]Not you.
[129:01.03]Damn it.
[129:09.91]Turn on Twitch im-
[129:20.15]Do what now?
[129:20.55]What do you want me to do?
[129:21.52]Alright, I'm getting distracted and I have to stop, I have to play.
[129:30.16]No, no, I wanted to- I didn't wanna- I wanted to cover myself in the water so I could be alive.
[129:39.73]Oh my god, what happened?
[129:55.82]I'm getting to floor four before I do any Twitch integration.
[129:59.76]Sorry.
[130:07.01]You promised.
[130:07.63]I told you it wasn't gonna happen, but not until I was satisfied with the base game.
[130:10.81]Plus, don't you guys know that once the Twitch integration is turned on, chat is gonna be over?
[130:18.38]Because you have to, like, spam symbols or words and shit.
[130:23.02]That's when you can't chat anymore.
[130:25.25]It's just going to be a flood of nonsense.
[130:26.93]And no one will be able to chat.
[130:27.98]So I wanted like a couple hours, two or three hours of chat.
[130:31.66]And then just one, two, three, or four spammed over and over again.
[130:35.44]I didn't say to do that now.
[130:54.91]Well, they're getting a head start.
[130:56.03]Okay.
[131:01.34]If you were really good at video games, you'd probably really like this game.
[131:03.80]Just to tell you.
[131:04.52]Just to give you, like, a little bit of insight.
[131:11.24]It's one of those games.
[131:11.88]It's one of those, if you're really good at games, you're gonna love this one.
[131:16.70]Did he actually just hit me with that?
[131:18.38]No.
[131:21.43]Waffle or pancakes?
[131:22.29]Neither.
[131:22.61]I think they're both bad.
[131:25.53]Ooh, here we go.
[131:26.17]Okay.
[131:30.09]Uh, this one is... Just take it.
[131:33.33]It's just a shitty bomb, though.
[131:35.23]Yeah, this sucks.
[131:38.25]What is this?
[131:38.77]Firebolt?
[131:43.80]And what's this one?
[131:46.54]It's just as awful.
[131:47.30]Okay.
[131:49.26]Well, this sucks.
[131:52.32]You got baited?
[131:52.96]Well, no.
[131:53.48]I don't... Look.
[131:56.58]When I go to a breakfast place, I'll just give you a good indicator of what I mean.
[132:00.79]When I go to a breakfast place, and I look at the menu, I never, ever, ever, ever order the pancakes or the waffles, ever.
[132:08.29]It's always on there, but I don't order it, ever.
[132:11.90]Waffles, never.
[132:15.42]Now, if my breakfast does come with pancakes, I will enjoy one.
[132:20.77]I'm of the opinion that pancakes are... They give you like a stack of three or four of them and it's too hard to eat all of them.
[132:26.65]You always just eat one or two and you can't eat the rest of them.
[132:31.49]I got a bomb down there.
[132:43.03]It's a bad take?
[132:44.53]No, I mean, I like pancakes but they're kind of too much sometimes.
[132:51.44]I don't think that's an unpopular opinion.
[133:04.63]I'll tell you my favorite breakfast item is... Have I told you?
[133:09.55]Do you guys know?
[133:10.11]Do you guys know?
[133:19.59]Corned beef hash.
[133:21.40]Corned beef hash.
[133:23.12]Done on the skillet.
[133:24.18]Nice and crispy and delicious.
[133:27.16]With an over-medium egg on top of it.
[133:30.00]Not over-easy.
[133:30.58]I'm not an over-easy guy.
[133:32.66]Over-medium egg right on top.
[133:34.22]Just laid on top of it.
[133:36.78]I like a jammy yolk.
[133:37.70]I don't like a runny yolk.
[133:40.35]What is going on up here?
[133:42.53]Oh, shit.
[133:42.95]This is perfect.
[133:44.53]Let me in there.
[133:49.05]A nice, warm, jammy yolk is better than a runny yolk.
[133:51.07]It's way easier to handle.
[133:52.27]In my opinion.
[133:57.49]There's a lot- Look at all these people in there!
[133:59.19]This is a fucking Minecraft spawner room!
[134:14.58]Axe, HP, nice.
[134:15.58]Alright.
[134:16.98]Leaf!
[134:20.97]You're the guy that orders 12 things at McDonald's.
[134:22.77]If we can't... There's so much gold left.
[134:24.93]I... I'm sorry.
[134:25.79]I... The gold.
[134:26.39]Ah!
[134:26.81]I saw... I know.
[134:29.45]I can't... I saw... People were talking about pancakes and I fucked up.
[134:40.72]Torch.
[134:41.98]Electric torch.
[134:44.24]Rain cloud.
[134:45.80]Chain bolt.
[134:47.12]Let's try that one.
[134:49.34]Oh, yeah.
[134:49.68]Get rid of these, like, wait, wait, wait.
[134:51.28]Okay.
[134:52.66]Damage and speed, mana drain 80.
[134:56.11]Okay, so let's see.
[134:58.89]This has 170.
[135:00.09]160.
[135:00.11]Alright, so this one is the one I want to use.
[135:04.67]Get rid of this bomb.
[135:07.91]Put that on there.
[135:08.53]What does this look like?
[135:11.94]Oh, that's a Star Wars blaster sound.
[135:14.18]I like it already.
[135:18.77]It's a delicious link.
[135:48.35]I guess.
[135:52.91]Mayonnaise soft drink.
[135:55.09]What would that even taste like?
[135:56.15]I feel like it would be impossible to capture the delicious deep flavor of mayonnaise in a liquid like that.
[136:03.04]Like in a drink.
[136:07.06]This would stink.
[136:09.18]You would and it would it would smell immediately.
[136:12.88]It would just stink.
[136:16.65]This is the kind of drink that you open and the person that is upstairs in your house can smell what you're doing downstairs.
[136:34.04]Can I combine that?
[136:34.88]Let me try this.
[136:36.94]This is spark bolt and chain bolt.
[136:43.60]Oh, that sucks.
[136:44.54]Oh, it's because it's not a shuffle.
[136:54.81]Eh.
[136:56.37]Damage 25, damage 3.
[136:58.13]That's not bad.
[137:00.09]Oh, what about one of these other ones?
[137:03.23]Bouncing?
[137:03.67]Maybe bouncing?
[137:04.29]Let's try that.
[137:11.76]Now, now it sucks.
[137:23.92]This one is shuffle.
[137:28.44]Yeah, get rid of the bombs.
[137:29.48]I think they're worthless.
[137:42.33]Shuffle bad.
[137:44.43]Shuffle bad.
[137:45.19]Okay.
[137:50.17]I'm gonna keep- I like the bouncy.
[137:54.75]I don't even need this wand.
[137:56.05]I guess I could do double bomb?
[137:58.17]What is double bomb gonna do for me?
[137:59.35]That'd be pretty cool, right?
[138:04.00]Shuffle sucks, it randomizes the order.
[138:10.40]Yeah.
[138:13.20]I'll keep this for now.
[138:16.08]The rest of these I don't think are very good.
[138:17.28]Maybe I'll rain cloud.
[138:18.74]Might as well try it, right?
[138:20.98]It's a watery weather phenomenon.
[138:25.93]Eh.
[138:29.58]But bouncing into the second wand.
[138:34.12]Okay, yeah, because it's... Holy shit.
[138:38.41]Right, okay.
[138:38.83]I don't even... This wand is kind of useless now.
[138:50.48]Wait, what about... Okay, cast delay 0.2.
[138:53.26]Cast delay 0.4.
[138:54.38]Recharge 0.6.
[138:56.60]Recharge... Oh, put this up here.
[139:00.50]Mana.
[139:07.93]Oh, this sucks for mana.
[139:10.71]Whatever.
[139:12.11]Alright, that's fine.
[139:12.73]This looks good.
[139:19.39]Knockback on spells, no.
[139:20.83]Wand experimenter, I don't know what that means.
[139:22.55]Faster wands.
[139:24.23]I feel like that's good.
[139:30.13]I feel like that's good.
[139:34.41]All wands you carry until incurring gain a bonus to their cast delay.
[139:40.64]Holy shit.
[139:43.98]Oh my god.
[139:45.62]That's kind of ridiculous.
[139:51.21]I can just go into a room and just do that.
[139:52.61]Okay, so I'm just gonna go into a room, get in the middle and go.
[139:55.07]Alright, this should be the run.
[140:00.00]Wand go brr.
[140:03.56]It's green too.
[140:06.12]That makes you- what did you said even funnier?
[140:10.22]Oh, automatically right off the bat we got a fucking legend everyone.
[140:15.71]Shuffle?
[140:17.28]Above and below, cast three spells.
[140:19.52]Ahead, above, and below the caster.
[140:22.46]Reduce the spread of the spell.
[140:24.87]And then it's a spark bolt with timer.
[140:46.61]This thing's terrible.
[140:57.52]Why is that cool?
[140:58.40]It looks like it could be so cool.
[141:00.98]This is not even doing the thing it's saying it's doing.
[141:05.26]Isn't it supposed to be shooting above and below me?
[141:09.43]Ow!
[141:12.93]Alright, let's go.
[141:18.47]It has got shuffles on.
[141:19.71]Oh, whatever.
[141:27.34]Safety protocol.
[141:28.18]Let's go do that before I go anywhere.
[141:29.52]Is it safe down there yet?
[141:35.22]This thing is awesome.
[141:36.06]I love it already.
[141:43.31]Alright, what's this?
[141:43.85]Truffle, no.
[141:47.81]This is Energy Sphere.
[141:51.11]Hmm.
[141:55.43]Recharge time, 2.8 seconds.
[141:57.34]Holy shit.
[141:57.94]Throw this thing in the trash.
[142:06.76]That's four spells per cast, though.
[142:11.18]Wait.
[142:11.94]Hold on.
[142:12.84]Alright, let me try it.
[142:21.50]That's awful.
[142:32.02]I mean, maybe if I put... Maybe I hold on to this.
[142:36.03]If I do, yeah, four spells might make this pretty good.
[142:37.99]What about these four up here?
[142:40.55]I'm holding on to this thing.
[142:48.17]Keep the chain bolt, though.
[142:49.21]Alright, what should I replace?
[142:50.13]This one.
[142:50.67]This one sucks.
[142:52.90]Yeah, get rid of this dumb thing.
[143:03.02]Keep going.
[143:03.40]Fuck this wand.
[143:09.28]That's what I said.
[143:13.77]Why is this fire going on here?
[143:16.29]How is there fire in water?
[143:18.57]What is... Something on the ground.
[143:22.20]Coal vein?
[143:23.32]Oh, it's water.
[143:24.00]Oh, drink.
[143:32.91]Gainbolt is homing?
[143:37.79]Doesn't seem very homing.
[143:43.02]Is it?
[143:47.64]Okay, I like it.
[143:48.44]You're right.
[143:48.88]It's very good.
[143:56.74]I don't wanna go yet, I only have a hundred bucks.
[143:57.98]No, I'm not going yet.
[144:05.89]Unban the word Lego.
[144:07.27]Why would Lego be banned on the channel?
[144:08.94]You just said it.
[144:09.60]What?
[144:10.26]Wait, Lego is banned?
[144:14.28]Why is the word Lego banned?
[144:28.18]Does it go through walls?
[144:28.90]No.
[144:37.55]This floor sucks.
[144:38.35]There's nothing here.
[144:38.89]Do I have to go all the way around to get anywhere?
[144:48.38]What the hell?
[144:57.95]I'm... guess I'm gonna go over here.
[144:59.25]Okay, here we go.
[145:08.32]Enemies.
[145:08.66]Somebody.
[145:09.44]Something.
[145:11.46]Fight.
[145:13.46]A... attack.
[145:15.92]Ooh, what's this?
[145:17.08]Kirby!
[145:26.86]Chili egg.
[145:27.62]Oh, I'm going to save that.
[145:29.68]And I can go down here.
[145:31.52]I have nothing that explodes.
[145:32.80]I don't have anything that explodes.
[145:39.53]What about the bomb wand?
[145:45.97]Yeah, hold on.
[145:46.45]I'll go get it.
[145:46.89]Wait, I actually might be able to get up.
[145:48.41]Hold on.
[145:54.10]I love this thing.
[145:55.00]Hopefully I can power this thing up like crazy.
[145:56.82]Fuck.
[146:01.94]That hurt.
[146:03.80]Unban the word Odama.
[146:06.06]No.
[146:08.02]That's my least favorite video game.
[146:10.26]That's staying banned forever.
[146:13.56]That looks pretty good.
[146:14.49]Alright, I gotta go get the bomb wand.
[146:19.69]Look this shit over here.
[146:20.39]Look at all this stuff.
[146:20.99]Alright.
[146:21.85]Bomb wand it is.
[146:31.01]It was this one down here, right?
[146:32.50]What the fuck is this?
[146:35.56]Oh, God.
[146:38.74]Uh, heavy spread and TNT?
[146:40.88]Alright, I gotta move some things.
[146:43.94]What do I replace this with right now?
[146:46.20]This one?
[146:49.04]Alright, I'm gonna come back for four.
[146:52.00]Let's blow this shit up.
[147:03.84]Alright, what is it?
[147:06.06]This looks good.
[147:08.60]It's a double spell firebolt.
[147:13.55]Heavy spread.
[147:18.25]That's terrible.
[147:22.71]How did I light on fire?
[147:31.01]Alright, let's blow this wall up.
[147:51.05]Gold!
[147:52.67]Yeah!
[147:57.24]How much money is that?
[148:00.46]Dude, easy.
[148:18.12]I gotta get in here.
[148:18.82]Can you please turn off the sharpness filter in your OBS?
[148:23.32]What are you doing?
[148:26.31]Sharpness filter in your OBS.
[148:27.29]It's not chat that is sharpening their images.
[148:29.01]It's your program.
[148:29.77]You turned it on one time during Little Hope to prove something about pixels and ever since you forgot to turn it off.
[148:37.12]What?
[148:46.94]Sharpness filter?
[149:00.69]It's real.
[149:02.05]It's real.
[149:02.69]It's real.
[149:03.23]Alright.
[149:03.71]It's real.
[149:04.83]It's real.
[149:05.89]Let's, let's, hold on.
[149:07.81]It's real.
[149:09.85]You guys aren't fucking around.
[149:15.03]I thought, I thought they were deep fried, like, like crispy memes or something.
[149:21.08]I didn't know.
[149:22.04]I was wondering why everybody was doing this today.
[149:32.11]God damn it.
[149:42.02]This is what it was.
[149:48.42]Okay, well, turn it off.
[149:50.69]Doesn't it look worse, though?
[149:52.23]It looks terrible.
[149:53.91]I want it to look like this.
[149:55.17]Doesn't it look awful when it's not on?
[149:56.79]I feel like I can't see.
[149:57.79]I hate this.
[150:00.87]I want it back on.
[150:06.93]Okay, what do the other ones look like then?
[150:08.23]Yeah, I was curious.
[150:13.05]I was like, why does everybody have this on?
[150:16.48]Even this shit.
[150:18.48]Even this.
[150:18.98]I was like, what's with the low quality?
[150:34.86]Okay, I was wondering why everything looked like a TV from the 90s.
[150:42.19]This was considered having a good cable box back in 1991, by the way.
[150:50.12]It's unbelievable.
[150:50.74]Okay, well, thank you for telling me that.
[150:52.14]For a second, I thought it was on the game, too.
[150:59.18]I was like, holy shit, that's bad.
[151:00.38]Alright, let's go.
[151:08.54]How do I get up here?
[151:09.33]I don't want to run out of these.
[151:14.71]I can't.
[151:15.39]That's not reliable.
[151:18.81]I gotta go all the way around.
[151:29.60]Sharpen the game.
[151:30.38]The game is already really sharp.
[151:31.88]I don't want any more people to leave that haven't already.
[151:43.56]poison shit out of here.
[151:48.92]Get it off!
[152:01.93]Deep fried.
[152:02.69]Yeah.
[152:03.69]Alright.
[152:04.55]I can't get over there, guys.
[152:05.84]Okay.
[152:13.53]I'm gonna have to arc these in a way that it hits and explodes at the right time.
[152:17.15]Like kind of far away.
[152:21.57]Come on, I got five more attempts.
[152:23.84]Come on.
[152:25.58]Come on!
[152:32.98]No!
[152:35.10]Yes!
[152:45.32]What's this?
[152:45.70]You replace something?
[152:47.64]Return.
[152:48.12]After a period of time, you'll be returned to where you cast the spell.
[152:53.04]That's a torch?
[152:57.87]Hold on.
[152:58.19]I just want to see.
[153:02.83]Ow!
[153:03.05]Don't... Okay.
[153:05.55]Okay.
[153:05.97]Stop it!
[153:06.45]Stop!
[153:06.97]Stop!
[153:07.39]Stop!
[153:07.75]What the fuck is happening?! !
[153:14.72]Fuck this thing.
[153:18.86]I'm not dead.
[153:19.52]I'm not dead.
[153:19.98]I'm fine.
[153:21.03]I can't die here.
[153:21.75]What's this do?
[153:24.31]Faster wands.
[153:25.05]Alright.
[153:25.43]I don't blow this.
[153:26.31]I gotta... Can I heal somehow?
[153:30.13]Ah!
[153:30.25]Alright.
[153:33.15]It's fine.
[153:46.29]Fly to the moon.
[153:57.73]I miss every shot.
[153:58.79]Okay, no, I'm good, I'm good.
[154:16.26]Just checking.
[154:16.84]I don't want to die.
[154:23.67]God, okay.
[154:27.53]Good, we're good, we're good.
[154:28.41]Just don't get killed.
[154:31.59]That's a big thing over there.
[154:32.47]That's a huge enemy.
[154:33.17]He's dead.
[154:37.94]He dropped a lot of gold.
[154:38.94]That's a lot of money.
[154:43.58]Don't touch it.
[154:44.12]It's a risk.
[154:45.00]Too risky.
[154:51.79]Oh my God, no.
[155:07.56]No, I didn't.
[155:09.12]Oh, why did I think for some reason that if you went to the portal that it took off status effects?
[155:13.28]I don't know why.
[155:13.94]No, no, no.
[155:14.80]I'm so pissed off.
[155:15.80]No integration.
[155:17.44]No, no integration.
[155:18.16]I'm mad now.
[155:19.48]I have to be happy for the integration.
[155:22.97]I'm not going to say that.
[155:23.97]Fix this, please.
[155:30.09]Fix this.
[155:31.29]Okay, I'll fix it.
[155:32.05]Pretty good Game Boy Advance game, I will say.
[155:54.65]Okay, one, one more, and then I, okay, one more, and then I'm gonna pee, and then I'm gonna do integration.
[155:58.72]Okay.
[156:01.28]I want a good one.
[156:06.46]I just keep getting distracted.
[156:07.68]No more distractions, okay?
[156:09.44]No more.
[156:10.46]If you have something that you have to tell me, tell me after class.
[156:16.19]No more distractions.
[156:16.87]Don't bring up, like, Family Guy iPad games.
[156:18.65]Don't bring up, like, how funny I looked when I was, had bad posture or something.
[156:23.73]No.
[156:23.87]No.
[156:26.45]I don't want to know.
[156:36.77]First wand of the evening.
[156:39.92]And it is.
[156:40.44]I mean, it's just, it's just fire shot.
[156:45.68]Fire shot.
[156:56.91]Next wand is... It's not a wand.
[156:59.53]It's just water.
[157:00.79]Who cares?
[157:02.19]I'm not clicking on that link.
[157:09.34]I told you no distraction.
[157:10.16]This is a no distraction run.
[157:12.36]I'm playing as if my life depends on it.
[157:22.96]I want that gold.
[157:24.58]I don't even know where it is.
[157:25.56]Whatever.
[157:28.02]Mr. Elbertson, can I use the bathroom?
[157:29.54]No.
[157:31.44]Until after school.
[157:34.98]That's actually kind of... No, that's fucked up.
[157:36.50]No, you can go to the bathroom if you want.
[157:38.16]What is that?
[157:42.96]That's too long to wait.
[157:49.05]Can I leave this, please?
[157:54.41]I'm stuck.
[157:56.35]Snow potion.
[157:59.29]Does that help?
[158:05.36]Not really.
[158:05.80]Okay, we're good.
[158:12.00]I want to get in there.
[158:19.73]Is that not breaking?
[158:23.59]You're peeing out, viewers.
[158:24.85]I'm fine.
[158:32.17]This looks good.
[158:33.95]Oh, what is this?
[158:36.49]Slime ball.
[158:37.65]Poisonous slime.
[158:42.07]This sucks.
[158:42.61]No, oh wait, wrong thing.
[158:46.08]Looks good.
[158:48.00]This looks like it's going to be pretty sick.
[158:50.92]It's very slow.
[158:56.75]Why is he going so fast?
[159:04.91]Mr. Elbertson, can we do chat integration now?
[159:06.81]No.
[159:11.95]What a shitty school this would be.
[159:15.25]You guys just watch the teacher play Noito?
[159:24.52]Mr. Elbertson, um, when are we gonna actually do schoolwork?
[159:28.04]I don't know, later.
[159:29.48]Shut up, leave me alone.
[159:31.62]This is the run.
[159:44.85]Can I hit one of these guys and do any damage at all?
[159:48.67]Would be great.
[159:56.02]Mr. Elbertson.
[159:56.76]Can you help me with my homework?
[159:59.66]Sure, bring it here.
[160:05.09]You need help with your homework?
[160:05.98]Yeah, sure.
[160:06.68]Rig it here.
[160:07.10]Let me see it.
[160:08.42]Where's that?
[160:09.16]Oh.
[160:10.26]Oh, wow.
[160:10.64]Yeah, it looks like you didn't fail out question three, four, and five.
[160:13.84]Let me help you with this.
[160:14.58]I did the trash.
[160:19.92]Now go sit down.
[160:20.48]Um, what happened?
[160:30.15]What did I do?
[160:32.61]What's happening?
[160:34.48]What's wrong with me?
[160:37.68]What's wrong with me?
[160:41.94]What do I do?
[160:42.52]Where am I?
[160:42.86]I stuck here forever?
[160:51.14]Don't shoot yourself in the head with the... Oh, it's unstable teleportanium potion.
[161:02.09]Well, take it and drink it.
[161:09.88]Okay, where... He's got a thousand subs.
[161:19.97]What?
[161:22.39]Why?
[161:22.59]I just like choked on my own water in my mouth.
[161:34.36]Oh, shit.
[161:35.66]Get in there.
[161:39.74]I hate that feeling.
[161:40.66]Is that not enough?
[161:47.64]Really?
[161:47.90]Hold on, I gotta...
[161:58.18]Play the game?
[161:59.06]I'm, what are you, I'm, I am playing.
[162:01.17]What are you talking about?
[162:02.03]I'm currently, like, just playing the game.
[162:04.63]Alright, we're good.
[162:14.51]Do not fucking kill me, you fireball asshole.
[162:28.51]Don't you... Die!
[162:38.01]Oh, come on.
[162:41.01]How many times do I have to hit you before you die?
[162:51.96]Douse him.
[162:54.44]Snow and water potion combined.
[162:57.06]That's a good idea.
[162:57.70]Watch out!
[162:58.02]This guy's gonna throw a bomb!
[163:01.54]I got him!
[163:13.79]He dropped a shitload of money, too.
[163:17.41]What's happening?
[163:17.91]I can't move!
[163:18.77]I just locked myself in the fire.
[163:22.31]Stop, please!
[163:23.05]Alright, I'm good.
[163:28.29]Quit pretending to play the game and play the game.
[163:30.97]Alright.
[163:33.75]Let's make some spells.
[163:37.09]Splitter bolt with a timer.
[163:39.43]Odd fireball.
[163:41.18]Glitter bomb.
[163:42.28]Firebolt with a trigger.
[163:43.86]And chainsaw.
[163:46.44]We have some wands to use here.
[163:49.30]Get the chainsaw.
[163:49.80]First and foremost.
[163:52.28]Let's get firebolt with a trigger.
[163:54.76]Glitter bomb.
[163:58.31]And split bolt.
[164:03.11]Time to make something happen here.
[164:04.91]Alright, this one is the do-do-do.
[164:07.13]That one's good.
[164:09.61]This is bomb, which kind of just sucks.
[164:13.33]What does this have for?
[164:16.37]Mana charge, max mana capacity, one.
[164:21.24]Cast delay, it's very, very fast.
[164:22.78]Hold on, let me see.
[164:29.23]That mana recharge though is really awful.
[164:31.53]Glitter bomb.
[164:33.45]Summons a bomb.
[164:40.46]And... Summon a bomb.
[164:46.00]Okay, I'm going to put a chainsaw here.
[164:47.88]Yeah, there it is.
[164:55.91]Now this one, this is a shuffle.
[164:59.48]But what if we do... Let's just fuck the whole thing up.
[165:06.92]You know what I mean?
[165:07.68]This is going to be a mystery one.
[165:12.95]Cast delay 0.3 seconds.
[165:16.59]1.5 second charge time.
[165:17.63]That's terrible.
[165:27.49]Shut this down.
[165:32.56]It's please that you please never subbed not donating free entertainment.
[165:37.25]Oh, that's fine.
[165:38.29]That's cool.
[165:38.77]I don't care I think this is gonna be a super mystery wand What do I even care I take this off though I
[166:02.54]Dreamer is an idiot.
[166:03.64]Why?
[166:03.88]What are you guys doing?
[166:09.88]Will you guys settle down?
[166:11.08]What the fuck is happening?
[166:15.06]Oh shit, that turns into like a million different bombs.
[166:18.71]Okay, I like it.
[166:19.31]Alright, this is fine.
[166:36.67]Worm Detractor, High Mana, Low Capacity, or Trick Blood Money.
[166:42.69]Irma's real name is Mitch.
[166:46.14]It is not.
[166:46.82]It is not, actually, at all.
[166:54.76]What?
[166:57.51]Alright, I'll integrate just after this.
[166:59.39]I'm going to integrate just after this, okay?
[167:02.09]You will get integrated.
[167:04.44]Somebody gave me $50.
[167:05.88]They gave me 5,000 bits.
[167:07.50]It was goo berry juice.
[167:08.30]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[167:09.78]That's a 5-0.
[167:10.68]Hey, Jerma, you're ugly.
[167:12.98]Does the engineer dance from the popular multiplayer team-based shooter Team Fortress 2?
[167:16.63]Alright, how about, um...
[167:25.63]I mana low capacity.
[167:27.17]Let's go.
[167:29.11]Your currently held wand loses half its capacity, but it gains more mana.
[167:32.49]Oh fuck, currently held wand.
[167:48.71]Shit.
[167:50.87]That's not good.
[167:53.33]Oh, well, we're going to be slime boys now.
[167:58.14]Put the other spell on it.
[167:59.34]Oh, wait a minute.
[168:00.70]It's not bad yet.
[168:01.66]We're fine.
[168:05.44]Which one should I put on?
[168:13.33]Chainsaw?
[168:13.87]Ooh!
[168:21.63]Ooh!
[168:23.54]That's not even that bad.
[168:29.55]No, wrong.
[168:30.39]What?
[168:34.05]Chainsaw was good on Bomb Wand.
[168:37.01]Oh, that's good on here, too.
[168:38.57]Chainsaw is great for digging.
[168:39.55]Yeah, that'll be fine.
[168:41.43]With this one, I really fucked it up, but whatever.
[168:43.16]I'm just supposed to do this now.
[168:45.68]Alright, we're going to have to try to get good with the slime.
[169:02.62]Kill the statue.
[169:03.40]No, I know what happens when you do that.
[169:04.44]It's not good.
[169:13.21]Currently... Yeah, this is awesome, actually.
[169:19.33]I'm actually kind of glad I fucked that up, because I can dig forever.
[169:22.85]And not have to wait.
[169:24.07]This is good.
[169:25.04]This worked out pretty well.
[169:27.74]But we have to slime, which sucks.
[169:42.88]Let's dig down here.
[169:43.38]Oh, come on.
[169:46.96]What did I hit?
[169:47.44]This chat.
[169:51.58]Look at this chat room right now.
[169:53.10]It's locked.
[169:54.94]I want the gold here.
[170:11.46]I'm just gonna dig and get all this gold.
[170:12.72]Who cares?
[170:20.76]Toxicity is at a thousand percent.
[170:22.82]It is.
[170:23.14]It's getting there.
[170:23.75]Ooey gooey, ooey gooey, ooey gooey.
[170:30.93]What have I done?
[170:31.67]I've created a monster.
[170:39.14]Don't they say that the streamer's community is an offshoot of the streamer's personality?
[170:43.68]You guys are all in Arkham right now.
[170:48.50]What have I done to you?
[170:49.30]Look at all this gold down here.
[170:58.59]I can't ignore it.
[171:11.74]If you're good at something.
[171:13.70]Never do it for free.
[171:23.08]This is 2D Minecraft.
[171:24.51]Not even remotely accurate what you just said.
[171:35.07]Don't you want me to get money?
[171:36.55]Come on, don't you see the 69 number?
[171:37.72]Isn't that one funny?
[171:47.57]This is ooey gooey Terraria.
[171:49.81]You just said that in front of Terraria.
[171:52.15]That doesn't even make any sense.
[172:05.65]I really do want it, but let's go.
[172:08.93]Look at all this shit.
[172:10.41]Alright, we've got a Pog1 situation here.
[172:16.44]This is double spell, double glitter bomb.
[172:22.77]Just jumped over that.
[172:30.97]It's actually not bad.
[172:40.92]I actually like it.
[172:41.54]What's wrong with this person?
[172:50.73]Uh, die?
[172:51.35]Die?
[172:53.87]Not gonna die.
[172:57.21]Not going to die.
[173:02.75]Alright, well I'm just gonna fucking destroy him.
[173:11.91]What's that look, huh?
[173:13.19]Lit a bomb.
[173:20.55]Max HP.
[173:21.86]Go.
[173:22.14]What's this do?
[173:26.90]Oh, it's a weird thing.
[173:33.44]Nice.
[173:34.15]Alright, money.
[173:35.33]Get money, quick.
[173:35.89]Alright, there's the end.
[173:37.97]We're good.
[173:38.33]I'm fine.
[173:38.69]Look it.
[173:38.95]We're good.
[173:42.05]Please ban everyone who's in chat.
[173:43.55]Alright.
[173:44.15]Do a massive ban.
[173:52.95]Literally, I'm just kind of sucking.
[173:59.25]The blast radius is awful.
[174:05.61]What's with this crap blast radius?
[174:15.64]And I'm on fucking fire.
[174:16.64]Of course I am.
[174:25.80]How did I even light on fire?
[174:28.40]Can I not get through this?
[174:29.12]Is it too tough?
[174:31.88]Here we go.
[174:37.72]And there we are again.
[174:39.32]On fire.
[174:39.78]Uh, if you see here, I'm still on fire.
[174:43.30]I don't know if this is a glitch with the demo I recorded, but... Still on fire.
[174:51.96]So I backstabbed this guy.
[174:54.80]Still on fire.
[175:02.25]Wow, we don't even have any real true Jerma985 YouTube fans in here, do we?
[175:09.36]That's the first video I ever made.
[175:10.60]Okay.
[175:13.83]Okay, fine.
[175:25.78]You know, sometimes I envy being in chat.
[175:27.80]I do, sometimes.
[175:29.20]Because, like, you could just write the most absolute fucking nonsense statement ever and just sit there and laugh while maybe a handful of people, like, look at it and go, what the fuck is that guy talking about?
[175:39.23]Like, I kind of envy that in a way.
[175:40.71]I do.
[175:44.78]And I can't even read half the things that you guys say.
[175:49.04]But, I mean, it was just ridiculous.
[175:51.06]It was ridiculous.
[175:51.58]And you typed it, you pressed enter, and then you leaned back in the chair and you left because you knew that one or two people, including me, might see it and go, this guy's fucking crazy.
[176:01.29]This looks good.
[176:03.77]Arrow.
[176:04.93]Speed up.
[176:05.85]Triple spell.
[176:06.86]360 mana.
[176:21.29]Fast arrow.
[176:26.82]This thing is galactically good.
[176:28.58]Is that fire or is that honey?
[176:35.72]What is this?
[176:38.30]I can't pick this up?
[176:41.60]Protection from all.
[176:46.76]Oh, what?
[176:47.22]Okay.
[176:47.78]Alright, I gotta go.
[176:48.92]I gotta get out of here.
[176:51.50]I like the arrow, though.
[176:52.58]We can make it something cool.
[176:57.32]The blood.
[177:07.43]Not into the... What?
[177:08.11]No.
[177:08.35]I'm saying into this part.
[177:09.63]Alright, 200.
[177:12.83]Finally, we get some wands.
[177:17.78]Holy shit, that's a lot of slime.
[177:20.66]Four spells cast per cast.
[177:23.00]Four slimes.
[177:27.05]This is four spells.
[177:28.75]This is bouncy ball and fire.
[177:33.73]Can afford that one.
[177:35.75]Can't afford this one, unfortunately.
[177:37.25]And I can not afford that one either.
[177:43.31]Burning trail.
[177:44.59]Tons of bouncy balls.
[177:45.73]That would just kill me.
[177:49.14]It's going to bounce around everywhere and it's going to light me on fire and I'm going to die.
[177:56.96]This one, on the other hand, kind of could replace this one.
[178:01.35]Four slimes at the same time.
[178:03.63]Better cast delay.
[178:06.97]Slightly worse mana charge speed.
[178:09.51]More maximum mana.
[178:11.11]Extra capacity.
[178:15.15]Yeah, let's go.
[178:18.07]Four second recharge.
[178:19.35]Yeah, but I shoot four at the same... Yeah, it's a long time.
[178:22.17]Get the bounce wand.
[178:27.43]Alright, I'm gonna replace bounce wand with... Yeah, I'll get this thing.
[178:35.71]I mean, this thing could be good.
[178:38.59]If I could just fire a regular weapon.
[178:41.67]That cast delay is stupid.
[178:44.78]That's ridiculous.
[178:47.14]Tiny recharge time.
[178:48.42]Tiny cast time.
[178:49.32]It's a spam gun.
[178:55.03]Should I put the saw on here?
[178:56.37]Dev and chat.
[179:00.95]Dev and chat.
[179:01.63]Really?
[179:02.05]What's up?
[179:05.23]Let me just... I want to see something.
[179:06.39]Hold on.
[179:09.97]Spark bolt on this guy down here.
[179:18.27]That's really, really good.
[179:20.55]But the... Look at that.
[179:21.89]The recharge time is awful.
[179:23.23]Yeah, that's why this thing sucks.
[179:30.43]But no, wait.
[179:31.61]Recharge time of point... Oh, that is bad.
[179:36.48]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[179:37.74]Eh, forget it.
[179:39.54]I'm gonna get rid of this one.
[179:41.84]I'll get the, uh... I'll get the Hell on Earth wand.
[179:47.21]Alright, I'm gonna get hell on Earth.
[179:51.72]Let's see what it does.
[179:53.42]Please don't kill me.
[179:55.23]Yup, okay.
[179:56.03]And this, you want me to use this wand?
[179:57.23]This is the wand you want me to use?
[179:59.41]This is, this is gonna be very bad.
[180:06.35]I will try.
[180:06.96]I have no guarantees though.
[180:09.10]Alright, let's take a look at the other stuff.
[180:10.98]Chainsaw's fine.
[180:12.40]Can I make the arrows any better?
[180:13.36]Triple speed up.
[180:16.16]What about triple speed up?
[180:18.12]Get rid of the arrows.
[180:20.75]Just for a second.
[180:30.21]It doesn't hurt you, dummy.
[180:31.51]Oh, well.
[180:32.19]What about triple speed up this?
[180:33.17]No.
[180:42.72]No, don't throw it on the ground.
[180:44.05]Go get that.
[180:48.49]Projectile speed.
[180:50.03]Can I just get rid of the triple spell and just do speed?
[180:55.76]Hold on.
[181:02.91]I can use it much more often, but hold on.
[181:12.53]Yeah, I can do it more often.
[181:17.26]There's never a slowdown.
[181:22.08]Yeah, that's better.
[181:27.40]His brain.
[181:30.39]Wait, is it shooting?
[181:31.03]Wait, what?
[181:31.79]Oh, it's shuffle.
[181:32.63]Whatever.
[181:33.05]I got this wrong.
[181:46.22]Uh, remove speed.
[182:00.53]Oh, put speed back on.
[182:05.39]Welcome to the wand expo.
[182:06.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[182:09.95]I'm gonna change this though.
[182:11.45]Uh, wait, can I make this anything?
[182:12.97]I wanna make this better.
[182:15.92]Slime sucks.
[182:16.84]I want to replace it with something else.
[182:19.82]It sucks.
[182:20.20]It just does.
[182:20.96]Let's be honest.
[182:21.56]It sucks.
[182:24.77]1, 3 should be in 1, 1.
[182:25.91]1, yeah.
[182:27.19]These two I'll switch back and forth.
[182:32.07]And there's my chainsaw.
[182:32.91]Okay.
[182:37.25]Speed up the slime.
[182:40.29]Yeah, but I... Slime sucks.
[182:43.37]I'll replace it with something else later.
[182:44.49]Alright, let's go.
[182:49.83]the spread off of Wand 4.
[182:54.17]I kind of like it like this.
[182:57.87]Speed up the slime.
[183:00.14]Speed up the slime.
[183:00.94]Speed up the slime.
[183:01.86]Speed up the slime.
[183:12.10]I'll get... No.
[183:12.85]No.
[183:13.05]It's awful.
[183:15.53]It's awful.
[183:24.34]Alright, let's go.
[183:27.29]Uh, worm attractor.
[183:28.45]Kills to mana or explosion immunity.
[183:31.67]I'll take it.
[183:32.85]No direct damage from explosions ever again.
[183:35.49]Don't make the god mad.
[183:36.61]Don't make god mad.
[183:37.25]Don't make god mad.
[183:37.98]Don't make god mad.
[183:38.74]Don't make god mad.
[183:40.74]Don't make god mad.
[183:41.44]Put yourself out.
[183:45.10]Oh, I made it.
[183:54.51]Okay.
[183:55.73]I think I'm going to win this one.
[184:07.28]I don't even know if I'm firing the weapon.
[184:11.97]I need fire immunity.
[184:14.27]Then I'm good.
[184:22.32]I'm running out of oxygen.
[184:25.34]Why am I running out of oxygen?
[184:30.64]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[184:33.24]I don't even know where I am.
[184:38.62]Enough, enough, enough, enough!
[184:42.74]Okay.
[184:44.86]Don't do that.
[184:46.98]I don't want that one.
[184:47.64]It's terrible.
[184:51.21]Speed and a bunch of dynamite, who needs it?
[184:55.45]Actually, better than the slime.
[184:56.51]I can't fire that once, man.
[185:13.52]I guess I can fire that before I go into a new room?
[185:22.54]70 I already hurt myself.
[185:23.82]I've already taken tons of damage.
[185:26.00]Should have never happened.
[185:34.79]Gonna jump out and get me.
[185:39.87]Really?
[185:48.21]Well, now I am actually in trouble.
[185:59.68]I'm truly in trouble now.
[186:00.85]I need something to save me here.
[186:06.91]Fill up your flask with water.
[186:09.33]Oh shit.
[186:21.88]Get a- I'm trying to- That person has a sniper rifle.
[186:32.72]What?
[186:34.62]You know what?
[186:35.04]Fuck you.
[186:44.53]Just crouch in the water.
[186:45.83]Fill this up.
[187:02.88]What are these?
[187:03.24]Teleport, Tanium, Levatium.
[187:07.58]Wait, what is Levatium?
[187:12.76]Okay, that's pretty good.
[187:15.51]Hover around more?
[187:16.51]Oh, that's actually really nice.
[187:17.41]Alright, let's move.
[187:17.89]I don't even think about it.
[187:27.85]Go get crunk.
[187:30.14]Crunk.
[187:30.76]Follow the lever.
[187:31.54]Go get crunk.
[187:32.38]What are you talking about?
[187:39.09]Sometimes I feel like you guys are a computer.
[187:56.88]Okay.
[187:57.30]I'm still alright.
[187:57.94]This is as far as I've ever been.
[188:00.72]Almost just rolled that into me.
[188:02.22]Almost.
[188:02.56]I give you credit.
[188:03.58]You tried.
[188:03.92]Alright.
[188:22.07]Where am I going?
[188:23.93]There's nothing here.
[188:28.89]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[188:30.78]Isn't this progress?
[188:33.18]What do you mean stop?
[188:33.78]There's nothing even over here.
[188:54.18]Why would I go up when I need to go down?
[188:58.47]I'm not going up.
[188:59.03]I need to go down.
[189:11.26]You're a coward.
[189:12.58]Coward for what?
[189:13.04]I don't know.
[189:13.30]What do you mean I'm a coward?
[189:14.40]I want to go down, not up.
[189:29.70]The portal is down.
[189:31.72]What, is there something bad up there that's gonna kill me?
[189:34.43]Like this, like this, like this.
[189:35.61]Poison, drink the poison.
[189:36.41]Drink the thing.
[189:36.89]Alright, I'm good.
[189:40.01]Drink.
[189:45.05]You're a chicken boy.
[189:46.19]We can all have our opinions.
[189:48.88]It's fine.
[189:49.10]It's fine.
[189:54.61]I'm not messing around.
[189:55.33]I'm just going to start doing that.
[189:56.63]Just getting out of the way.
[189:57.89]There's something over there.
[190:06.57]Is he dead?
[190:13.44]Is he dead?
[190:13.86]I think he's dead.
[190:20.16]What is hurting me?
[190:22.78]What hurt me?
[190:25.82]Somebody's flying.
[190:29.00]Hold on, what is that?
[190:29.60]Is this good?
[190:39.11]Acid ball.
[190:41.65]Terrifying acidic projectile.
[190:45.57]And increased mana.
[190:57.22]I'll try it.
[191:01.74]Yes, I'm good.
[191:04.20]Get me out.
[191:04.64]The furthest I've ever been.
[191:06.36]I can go.
[191:12.12]I don't have enough money to buy any of these besides this one.
[191:21.50]But I don't really want it.
[191:23.14]I think I'm saving my money.
[191:27.47]Remove the fire from this.
[191:28.93]Yeah.
[191:30.43]Not a bad idea.
[191:35.50]I took the fire off!
[191:36.24]I took the fire off!
[191:37.40]I took the fire off of that!
[191:38.70]I took off the fire!
[191:39.70]Why is it doing this?
[191:40.44]What's down there?
[191:41.70]What is that?
[191:43.78]I can't fucking believe it, dude.
[191:45.50]Why?
[191:46.00]What is going on right now?
[191:46.96]I took the fire off.
[191:51.91]Why is there still fire?
[191:57.97]always casts explosion.
[192:11.84]Get rid of the spread?
[192:13.00]I'll be alright.
[192:15.14]Okay.
[192:16.22]This is where we take a look.
[192:17.12]I can only afford this, but I don't think I want it.
[192:23.63]Do more balls.
[192:25.17]I wish I had more balls.
[192:27.53]I could do one, two, three, four, but then I could do something else too.
[192:31.03]I could do three spark bolts.
[192:35.60]Shoot four at once.
[192:36.32]You don't need the spread.
[192:37.22]Hold on.
[192:41.82]Oops.
[192:42.06]Okay.
[192:50.04]So then why don't I do those four and then spark bolt as well?
[193:00.31]Does it even matter?
[193:00.85]No?
[193:01.37]Alright, so how do I get down there?
[193:06.75]Do you see that thing down there?
[193:11.01]I gotta pee really bad.
[193:13.04]I gotta pee.
[193:13.38]I'll be right back.
[196:10.27]Hey, what's up?
[196:20.02]More money came in?
[196:21.34]More $50 donations came in?
[196:24.08]Two of them.
[196:29.26]5,000.
[196:29.72]We can't hear you?
[196:30.32]You can.
[196:30.60]Hold on, I'm going to burp.
[196:35.03]No, I'm not.
[196:39.28]Uh, there was 5,000 bits from the Beer Hunter.
[196:41.94]Thank you, Beer Hunter.
[196:45.18]Herman, my new schedule at work has basically prevented me from watching you stream for several months.
[196:51.15]Uh, I miss you, and since I got the chance to catch a stream, I thought I would pop in and say hi.
[196:55.89]Well, we've all missed you too.
[196:59.01]What the f- I was about to say, what the fuck, but you got, like, a new, like, work schedule.
[197:10.32]I was going to jokingly say, seriously, thank you for the huge amount of money, and welcome back.
[197:13.96]You can catch a stream, you can.
[197:16.27]If you can't, you can't.
[197:17.75]It's all good.
[197:20.77]Thanks for the huge drop of money.
[197:22.97]And then, speaking of another huge drop of money, thank you to Spike Sensei.
[197:29.15]The 5,000 bits.
[197:31.67]Aloha, Jerma.
[197:32.35]This is my first time ever donating.
[197:33.94]Sorry for leeching free content this whole time.
[197:36.38]Hope you have a good night and the rest of your stream.
[197:39.01]It's not, you're not leeching free.
[197:41.57]But by its very design, this stream is free.
[197:47.85]Leeching.
[197:52.85]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[197:55.05]You're not a, you never were a leech.
[198:00.43]Ah, nice Powerade.
[198:02.12]I love Powerade.
[198:05.39]I really do.
[198:05.81]I don't even care if you're not supposed to drink it.
[198:07.82]Unless you're, like, working out.
[198:08.64]I don't give a shit.
[198:09.32]I love it.
[198:09.64]Alright, let's go.
[198:22.33]Suedo advertisement joke needs to stop.
[198:24.97]I love Powerade.
[198:26.27]I love McDonald's.
[198:28.07]I love Powerade and I love McDonald's.
[198:31.27]What do you want me to do?
[198:32.25]Lie to you and say that I don't like it?
[198:36.06]last cannon oil blood or angry ghost I could re-roll it that's true angry ghost
[198:58.72]What color Powerade?
[198:59.74]Uh, purple Powerade's the best.
[199:01.06]Blue Powerade's okay.
[199:02.06]Uh, red Powerade is third place, I think.
[199:05.44]And orange Powerade and orange Gatorade taste like stomach acid or throw up.
[199:09.60]I don't like either one of them.
[199:15.67]Let's do Angry Ghost.
[199:17.91]An angry spirit comes to your aid, copying nearby spells and projections.
[199:21.01]Really?
[199:24.65]I don't see you copying anything.
[199:29.16]Don't anger the god.
[199:29.78]Go.
[199:37.67]Doesn't look that angry.
[199:38.51]No, not really.
[199:41.59]Orange Gatorade made me throw up one.
[199:42.91]Yeah, it sucks.
[199:45.01]I don't understand why they... I don't know why they still make it.
[199:47.31]I have no idea why they make it still.
[199:49.07]Nobody drinks it.
[199:49.57]It's horrible.
[200:03.23]Why can I- Please move.
[200:04.73]Please move.
[200:05.49]Please?
[200:06.35]Please move?
[200:10.51]What the fuck?
[200:13.11]Dude, alright.
[200:13.79]I've had enough of this shit.
[200:16.23]Did I just get hit in the face by my own thing?
[200:20.47]What the fuck?
[200:21.23]Why am I stuck in the pixel?
[200:23.50]That's very angry inducing.
[200:25.96]I can't- I can't even move.
[200:28.46]I get stuck in like the pixel shit.
[200:35.62]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[200:37.04]What's this shoot?
[200:55.47]Sniped point blank.
[200:57.03]No, but right here I got like fucking latched on and they're all just aiming at me and firing at me.
[201:11.64]This hissy base is a madhouse.
[201:13.46]Oh, I'm dead.
[201:14.34]I just like, I just died.
[201:15.70]I'm dead.
[201:16.16]Right, fun.
[201:17.08]Right, really fun.
[201:17.76]In the first five seconds of the map, I'm dead.
[201:20.90]What is this, what is this bullshit down here?
[201:23.31]Like, I'm just, I'm just dead immediately.
[201:30.87]You get like stuck in the quicksand.
[201:34.83]I'm turning on integration.
[201:36.59]That's stupid.
[201:50.32]Alright, let me turn on streamer mode.
[201:51.50]I don't want to leak anything.
[201:52.74]Is this going to leak something?
[202:00.59]Streaming.
[202:03.09]Okay, here we go.
[202:09.15]Okay, we're apparently connected.
[202:13.59]I guess.
[202:15.37]I guess the chat is connected somehow.
[202:22.79]What does that mean?
[202:24.21]Let stream viewers interact with your game through the Twitch chat.
[202:26.41]Okay.
[202:26.63]Did it work?
[202:33.00]Next vote in 16 seconds.
[202:40.78]What are you voting for?
[202:46.56]Social Security just got DM'd to me.
[202:56.65]Voting ends.
[202:57.43]New one.
[202:58.13]Wait, is this gonna just give it to me?
[202:59.48]This just gives me shit?
[203:01.56]I told you the chat was gonna be a mess when we turn this on.
[203:11.22]Give me a... Oh, yeah.
[203:13.36]Remove the ground.
[203:14.60]Sure.
[203:15.16]That one will be fun.
[203:23.03]What does that even do?
[203:27.59]Okay, okay, I guess it removes the- ooh, what's this one?
[203:30.91]Circle of Thunder?
[203:32.83]Alright, I wanna go down.
[203:44.92]I can't fucking believe I just did that.
[203:47.80]What the fuck did I do that for?
[203:51.72]I just was trying to rush.
[203:55.74]All nearby ground disappears.
[203:59.74]Well, that ain't gonna... Thank you.
[204:01.10]You just saved my life.
[204:02.68]Thanks, guys.
[204:04.38]I appreciate that.
[204:04.98]You literally just saved me from dying.
[204:17.76]There's too many things to keep track of.
[204:26.39]How do I remove fire from the game?
[204:28.03]Hey, next time you can vote.
[204:29.71]Vote on take fire out of game.
[204:37.16]All the gold?
[204:37.70]Yeah, I can't go there because I'm going to burn.
[204:49.63]Get...
[204:51.57]Nothing I hate more than getting stuck in video games.
[204:53.79]Like getting stuck on shit.
[204:55.12]Nothing pisses me off more than getting stuck.
[204:58.62]Like... Nothing more.
[205:01.69]Nothing more than that.
[205:16.73]I'm already fucking dead.
[205:17.99]Just reset it.
[205:18.60]Reset it.
[205:19.04]Reset it.
[205:19.54]Reset it.
[205:20.06]Kill me.
[205:21.08]Reset it.
[205:29.14]It's anger inducing, huh?
[205:30.91]It is.
[205:31.75]I agree.
[205:32.25]Oh, I'm changing some of these things up a little.
[205:36.37]Now I know why everyone said this is a rage game.
[205:37.93]I didn't believe you until I got to that temple and got stuck in the ground and died.
[205:44.94]I don't want you guys to see this.
[205:45.92]Time between votes.
[205:47.26]About what?
[205:48.46]60 seconds?
[205:52.80]Voting time.
[205:54.04]30 seconds?
[205:54.32]Okay.
[206:02.59]Hide the vote count.
[206:03.77]Yep.
[206:06.65]I don't want you guys to see that.
[206:10.91]Tiny ghosts can be named after viewers.
[206:12.89]Sure.
[206:13.33]Yeah, that sounds good.
[206:13.99]Alright, that looks good.
[206:17.50]Let's go.
[206:22.68]I'm gonna try as hard as I can now.
[206:24.74]Here we go.
[206:25.44]Actually, this one's gonna be the fucking run.
[206:27.56]No more getting stuck on tiny sand pixels.
[206:35.79]Okay.
[206:40.55]Enter the mines.
[206:47.86]What did he just do to me?
[206:48.72]Did he just headbutt me?
[206:54.72]Get that money!
[206:55.22]Oh shit, I can't even see what it is either, can I?
[207:03.09]No, I can't.
[207:04.41]Sea of lava.
[207:05.07]A huge body of lava is summoned.
[207:08.39]Where?
[207:11.50]Oh, right there.
[207:12.44]Okay.
[207:17.76]You know what?
[207:18.44]I actually don't like the fact that I don't know what you guys are doing.
[207:22.86]Because it's a mystery to me too.
[207:25.14]I don't like that.
[207:37.57]What wand is this?
[207:38.29]It's dynamite.
[207:39.49]Alright, let's dynamite over there.
[207:40.49]Let's go.
[207:50.26]Um, how much mana?
[207:51.52]This thing sucks.
[207:52.12]Come here, cannibal.
[207:57.64]Come here.
[208:00.34]Come here.
[208:02.81]Come here.
[208:03.13]Come here, coward.
[208:04.67]Come here.
[208:05.05]He flipped me off.
[208:07.61]Ooh, give me that.
[208:16.65]Oh, it's poison.
[208:20.12]I can't even get in there anymore.
[208:21.74]Shit, I want whatever that... Give it to me.
[208:25.13]Drain the poison.
[208:25.91]Drain the poison.
[208:28.87]One of those fire assholes is right there too.
[208:37.98]Giga saw blades everywhere.
[208:41.22]For a time, all projectiles become giant saw blades.
[208:45.50]All...
[208:51.01]Okay.
[208:53.67]Oh my god, that did so much damage to me.
[208:58.62]That was so bad.
[209:02.44]What happened to me?
[209:03.00]I turned into a snail.
[209:07.74]Did you guys do this?
[209:14.97]Ooh, that's good.
[209:19.09]I'll fight things with saw blades.
[209:21.14]Is it still saw blades?
[209:22.88]Jesus.
[209:32.31]And I got hurt.
[209:33.93]Delete poison and fire from the game.
[209:35.43]Probably dead.
[209:42.81]I get touched once, I'm fucking dead.
[209:47.41]Do three.
[209:48.10]Do three.
[209:48.82]Do three.
[209:49.44]Do three.
[209:49.80]Everybody do three.
[209:52.24]Ooh, that was ugly.
[209:53.32]I can't even do it, man.
[210:00.39]That shit does 75 damage.
[210:03.09]I'm fucking murked.
[210:21.98]I feel like this is... I'm... You know what?
[210:23.48]I'm so glad that I did not turn this on until, like, playing for a little while.
[210:32.62]If I had done this from the second I turned the stream on, I would not have thought the game was fun.
[210:36.14]I would have been like, oh, that was cool for a little bit, I guess.
[210:38.20]No, let's move the fuck on.
[210:39.70]This is stupid.
[210:51.40]Now there's no going back, right?
[210:52.49]There's not a scenario now on stream where I turn this off.
[210:57.61]You all know it.
[211:08.67]Alcohol trail.
[211:09.45]Your projectiles leave a trail of alcohol.
[211:11.46]Wait.
[211:15.42]What the fuck is going on?
[211:17.40]Oh, that's an acid potion!
[211:19.36]Just start it over again.
[211:20.82]Start it over again.
[211:21.60]Just start over.
[211:22.26]I- Start it over.
[211:34.12]You didn't check your equipment, you nerd.
[211:35.80]I- Oh, okay, here's water.
[211:39.94]It's not acid.
[211:40.86]Can I get down to at least the second floor, please?
[211:53.49]There's so many potions in the game, I didn't even know acid was a possibility.
[211:56.67]Okay.
[211:59.47]Gotta jump.
[212:20.89]Jump!
[212:21.17]Gotta jump!
[212:25.93]Shower.
[212:26.89]A rain cloud spawns on you.
[212:28.29]Oh, cool.
[212:29.11]Thanks.
[212:29.91]That'll help with the fire.
[212:34.73]Actually, very good thing for you to do.
[212:45.26]That looks like a big wand down there.
[212:46.74]Heard him.
[212:56.87]Alright, I got the cloud still, right?
[212:58.33]How long does it last?
[212:58.95]Oh, I don't have it anymore.
[213:00.77]Is this a torch?
[213:07.36]Just a torch.
[213:09.32]That looks really cool for just what is essentially a nerf gun.
[213:27.24]Sing the raid song?
[213:27.98]Wait, I gotta raid it?
[213:29.14]Oh, there's a raid.
[213:29.71]Alright, I'll sing the raid.
[213:38.55]Thank you for the raid.
[213:39.72]Really appreciate it.
[213:41.34]I am so happy.
[213:43.66]Thanks.
[213:45.36]What was it?
[213:46.70]Busty Lugs VR.
[213:54.30]I think that's a VR streamer.
[213:55.26]Thanks a lot.
[213:56.52]Welcome.
[213:56.84]Hope you had a good stream.
[213:57.58]Welcome, everybody.
[213:58.18]We're playing Noito with Twitch integration.
[214:00.12]It's pretty cool.
[214:00.56]It's pretty fun.
[214:03.17]That was sad.
[214:04.21]Was it?
[214:06.23]I turned on, like, the auto-tune and just started making horrible noises.
[214:09.21]I hope it was painful.
[214:14.77]Oh, you guys just did the Yoshi's Island thing to me.
[214:17.71]This is not that bad.
[214:19.23]Now that's good.
[214:21.97]Yep.
[214:22.61]Alright, this just saved the run here.
[214:36.29]There's a song that goes with this too, isn't it?
[214:39.60]Yeah, it's like... That's Angry Beavers, never mind.
[215:06.51]I forgot about that show.
[215:07.65]Alright, now, when I turn the stream off, I am going to watch, like, four episodes in a row of Angry Beavers.
[215:19.56]Oh, you feel... Copy, beaver.
[215:24.26]Finally made it to the bottom.
[215:25.60]Can you believe it?
[215:28.72]Oh, wait, I'm gonna wait for this.
[215:29.50]What is this?
[215:29.94]Loot, Treasure Rain, Glisten, and Health+.
[215:31.86]Alright, give me something good.
[215:38.78]Treasure rain.
[215:40.74]Yes!
[215:42.08]Holy, wait.
[215:43.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[215:44.60]I can't walk over there.
[215:46.66]I can't walk over there.
[215:47.30]It's going to stop it.
[215:48.64]Why did I stand here?
[215:52.48]No, I can get it.
[215:56.00]Oh, it disappeared.
[215:56.92]I got it.
[215:57.65]Thanks, guys.
[215:58.77]Thanks for the treasure.
[216:04.47]Somebody just gave a lot of bits.
[216:06.25]Yeah.
[216:12.59]400.
[216:12.63]I can afford whatever I want now.
[216:16.70]Double spell, double spell.
[216:19.24]Slime ball light.
[216:21.18]It's kind of expensive.
[216:25.68]Spell only shoots one.
[216:27.98]Energy sphere.
[216:32.56]This was like four or five.
[216:38.87]That's not bad.
[216:41.31]Max mana.
[216:41.71]How much does it shoot this mana?
[216:43.53]20?
[216:46.21]That's not bad.
[216:47.39]Could be worse.
[216:49.94]Ooh.
[216:52.08]Spitterbolt.
[216:54.08]700 mana.
[216:56.52]Dogshit recharge.
[216:59.08]What?
[216:59.68]Hmm.
[217:04.09]What about this one?
[217:07.28]Giga disc projectile?
[217:09.27]I kind of like this one.
[217:24.56]Teleport bolt, magical bolt that moves you wherever it ends up.
[217:26.94]No, don't want that.
[217:27.86]Alright, I'll take the giga one.
[217:33.18]Go.
[217:34.08]Go.
[217:41.78]Did they hit me?
[217:42.34]Can they hurt me?
[217:42.76]Can these hit me?
[217:47.97]Okay.
[217:50.57]Well, alright.
[217:53.09]I'm good.
[217:53.35]Let me see if I want to change this around, though.
[217:57.31]This is cool.
[217:58.84]This is Giga.
[218:06.72]Okay.
[218:08.42]I'm happy with all this right now.
[218:13.17]that sucks actually plague rats extra knockback or your projectiles come back to you well they already do that's okay so it's extra
[218:44.42]Ah, shit.
[218:45.12]Okay, whatever.
[218:50.26]So, that probably wouldn't have happened if I didn't already have it on there.
[219:00.72]You shot yourself in the head.
[219:02.04]You need to give a thousand subs.
[219:03.40]No.
[219:03.90]This is not in the game.
[219:04.86]Little hope.
[219:09.77]That was looking like a pretty good run, too.
[219:12.35]Oh, well.
[219:16.91]What is that?
[219:25.56]That's gonna blow up that.
[219:26.52]Okay, that's oil.
[219:27.36]I get it.
[219:33.44]You become drunk.
[219:36.19]It's like a sword.
[219:38.23]I'm already on fire.
[219:42.73]What does drunk mean?
[219:44.15]Holy shit, look at the capacity on this thing.
[219:48.11]Firebolt.
[219:48.93]This has got 11 capacity?
[219:52.13]It only shoots one at a time, though.
[219:54.63]Aww.
[219:59.35]And it's shuffled.
[220:00.27]That's terrible.
[220:10.39]Bad.
[220:11.57]Eh, it's kind of bad.
[220:13.70]It can't even... Can that even become any good?
[220:16.70]Or no.
[220:17.36]Not really.
[220:23.07]Is it a double cast?
[220:23.95]No.
[220:25.13]Does it?
[220:29.03]No.
[220:33.66]Oh, that's pretty.
[220:34.18]That's really pretty.
[220:36.84]That's cool.
[220:40.33]It's burning all like the sand.
[220:54.96]Okay, go... just kick this out of the way.
[221:00.62]I'm not touching that.
[221:08.83]Oh, let's blow this up.

[221:57.43]This is going to be somebody in chat, right?
[222:01.43]Who is it?
[222:03.34]What's their name?
[222:03.74]Do they have a name?
[222:07.24]Oh no, that's a ghost.
[222:12.48]Alright, watch out.
[222:16.55]I don't want to hurt you.
[222:26.10]Okay, I want to get in there.
[222:27.10]There's something in there.
[222:27.68]There's a potion in there.
[222:32.82]Oh, sick'em!
[222:37.12]This is a Berserkium potion.
[222:46.12]And it's like a gem?
[222:48.24]Broken wand.
[222:49.18]Please get rid of an item to make space for it.
[222:50.85]What's a- what do you mean broken wand?
[222:55.75]Uh, your body has burnable gas for a time.
[222:58.37]Okay, well, I don't- what should I get rid of?
[223:00.05]Fire potion?
[223:03.64]All these, if I throw, I feel like I'm gonna explode immediately.
[223:13.90]Broken wand, what does it do?
[223:16.64]This wand has snapped in half, but it still crackles with magical energy.
[223:23.62]I stink, Cloud.
[223:24.64]Yeah, you guys did it.
[223:29.03]You can throw it for a random spell.
[223:30.69]Okay, why did I think the frogs were friendly?
[223:42.75]I thought the frogs were friendly.
[223:55.62]Not even gonna blow enough.
[223:56.92]Yes it is.
[224:08.35]It's just all poison down there.
[224:09.55]I can't even touch it.
[224:16.46]I need some more money.
[224:18.04]First and foremost.
[224:27.66]Hash.
[224:29.44]Did I just hit myself?
[224:30.18]I did, didn't I?
[224:32.74]I'm moving fast?
[224:44.51]This guy just died.
[224:48.21]Am I moving that much faster?
[224:49.29]Maybe a little.
[224:51.54]Why do I care about money?
[224:52.42]I have a thousand gold.
[224:53.50]What am I doing?
[224:54.02]I forgot about that.
[225:03.67]Poisoned.
[225:10.74]Okay.
[225:11.94]He's flexing.
[225:15.30]Sure, okay.
[225:16.38]Picked up a spell refresher.
[225:19.50]This is a teleport wand.
[225:21.25]Wait, that's kind of interesting.
[225:22.55]What does it do?
[225:24.37]Always cast gunpowder arc.
[225:28.40]And I fly wherever I move to.
[225:31.84]So is this a firewall?
[225:34.20]Or a fire walking from Diablo?
[225:41.99]It sucks.
[225:42.45]It probably sucks.
[225:47.11]Okay, four spells at the same time.
[225:49.78]Always cast magic arrow.
[225:51.16]And it's going to do all this.
[225:55.48]Lower Castellay.
[225:57.74]Spread it everywhere.
[225:59.16]Black Hole.
[226:00.50]Spark.
[226:01.10]No.
[226:02.54]God Wand.
[226:03.04]No, it's not.
[226:03.66]Fuck this thing.
[226:04.88]I tried Black Hole before and it was a disaster.
[226:15.15]Okay.
[226:17.19]It's just the Giga Saw thing again.
[226:20.99]And what is this?
[226:25.17]Bubble Spark.
[226:25.93]A bouncy, inaccurate spell, but this is huge spread and double spell.
[226:33.03]Oh, it only casts one.
[226:34.07]This thing sucks.
[226:40.24]Bubba... Bubble Spark.
[226:44.72]Third one is probably the best for stats.
[226:47.20]Max mana.
[226:48.99]Mana charge speed.
[226:49.89]Cast delay.
[226:55.01]This one's kind of good too.
[226:59.92]I kind of want to play with this one though.
[227:05.28]Always casting this is OP.
[227:06.98]How much damage does it do?
[227:10.85]10?
[227:10.99]I guess that's good.
[227:12.37]I'm gonna get it.
[227:15.83]I can just put other spells on this.
[227:19.23]A bunch of hissy appear out of thin air.
[227:20.66]What's hissy rain?
[227:48.19]is like a bad joke.
[227:52.27]Alright, how about this time?
[227:54.37]Everybody has to agree to give me the good options.
[227:57.73]I need the extra help.
[228:01.85]This is a really good start.
[228:06.03]This is a very good start.
[228:07.43]Look at this thing.
[228:08.13]It's very good.
[228:11.79]Good starter wand.
[228:15.06]And you gave me a thousand gold and you took it all away in the next room?
[228:19.76]Really?
[228:20.04]Hey, here's a thousand gold.
[228:22.30]Let's spawn like late game enemies on you and have you die.
[228:36.69]You track projectiles for a while.
[228:40.76]No!
[228:42.08]Wait, these can't hurt me.
[228:44.12]What's wrong with this frog?
[228:47.62]What happened to me?
[228:48.58]I'm a fish?
[228:50.07]He just ate me.
[229:00.25]Alright, give me something to work with.
[229:11.92]Give me something to work with.
[229:18.52]Try harder, Boomer.
[229:20.03]Alright, fine.
[229:23.17]That's how you want to play it?
[229:24.03]I'll play it like that.
[229:28.15]But if I were in the chat right now, I would be pressing 4.
[229:30.06]Hey, guys.
[229:33.36]I don't know.
[229:33.98]I'm kind of new to video games.
[229:35.82]I heard that there's a new Diablo coming out.
[229:37.68]Do you know what the iteration is?
[229:39.17]Is it 3 or is it... I don't know if there's a new Diablo coming out.
[229:43.71]How many in the series have there been?
[229:46.81]I don't even... It's tricky for me in my mind.
[229:49.58]I don't know.
[229:59.28]A huge worm appears.
[230:01.18]I'm assuming he's here.
[230:03.30]I'm assuming this huge worm is over here.
[230:05.86]Yeah, there he is.
[230:08.18]In the first room?
[230:10.22]In room one?
[230:12.44]Room one.
[230:15.36]Why would you do this to me?
[230:16.54]I just walked down out of the entrance.
[230:22.00]Alright, I just gotta leave.
[230:23.26]Get out quick.
[230:25.30]Wherever he is, he's distracted.
[230:29.28]Jesus Christ!
[230:31.44]Is he blocking it?
[230:32.16]What's he doing?
[230:34.00]What's wrong with him?
[230:34.78]Oh my god, I just blew his head up!
[230:36.55]Is it gold?
[230:40.99]There's no gold!
[230:51.45]Should've drank his blood.
[230:52.51]I don't know.
[230:53.89]I can't even do anything.
[230:56.14]Oh, I have 80 gold.
[230:57.48]Yeah, I want the saw.
[231:04.40]Fuck you didn't even do that to me, and I just did it to myself.
[231:27.76]This is my oh shit button and this is the one I'm going to use.
[231:29.40]I'm going to get... Okay.
[231:30.98]Improve my wands.
[231:32.16]All your wands in your vicinity get slightly better.
[231:36.56]Did they?
[231:38.28]Nice.
[231:41.12]Guys, I can do this forever.
[231:43.22]Why can I do this forever?
[231:43.98]It's infinite.
[231:47.34]Okay.
[231:47.94]Now, the next boat will give me health.
[231:49.72]Kirk lottery.
[231:52.28]Gold is forever.
[231:53.60]High mana, low capacity.
[231:56.35]Wait a minute.
[231:57.15]Should I do that one?
[232:03.25]Lottery, lottery, lottery, lottery, lottery.
[232:06.68]When you pick a perk, there's a 50% chance the others won't disappear.
[232:09.14]That's actually pretty awesome.
[232:10.30]Alright, now give me like max HP plus 20.
[232:11.98]Alright, on this list, is it going to be like a give the person money?
[232:18.93]Or give the person health?
[232:20.67]I want it.
[232:29.21]I'm not going to use that.
[232:29.89]It's going to kill me.
[232:31.39]Fuck that thing, seriously.
[232:32.17]Okay.
[232:39.71]Regeneration field.
[232:42.24]That's what I want.
[232:43.14]Give me that one.
[232:43.60]That means it's going to heal me, right?
[232:48.42]He's carrying a bomb.
[232:54.25]Yeah, let me get a regeneration field.
[233:03.72]Dead.
[233:06.88]Yes.
[233:08.23]Oh, yeah.
[233:09.11]There it is.
[233:09.61]You guys rock.
[233:10.43]Thank you.
[233:25.25]Oh, I can't get in there.
[233:40.59]Don't fall.
[233:41.17]The guy's holding the bomb scared the shit out of me right now.
[233:44.13]I don't want nothing to do with that.
[233:51.75]Can't go that way.
[233:52.49]Maybe I can go that way.
[233:55.04]Nice job.
[233:55.56]You kicked it the right way.
[234:01.84]God damn it, man.
[234:03.94]What the fuck?
[234:05.84]It was off the damn screen.
[234:18.04]Why?
[234:18.94]I'm never picking that up ever again.
[234:23.57]I'm not.
[234:24.49]If I see a saw blade, I'm going to rip it out immediately and throw it in the trash.
[234:27.91]I'm not using that ever again.
[234:44.72]You know, like, typically I would be so embarrassed.
[234:47.70]That's very embarrassing, but, like, no.
[234:49.90]That weapon sucks.
[234:50.81]It's too difficult to use.
[234:51.83]It's not even fun to use it.
[234:54.27]It's not good.
[234:54.97]It's bad.
[234:55.43]Nice try.
[235:02.99]Ooh.
[235:13.36]I'll take that.
[235:16.27]Summon random homunculi.
[235:18.27]A group of helpful little homunculis are here for you.
[235:20.79]Oh, there's people in chat.
[235:21.95]There you are.
[235:22.95]Look it.
[235:23.23]Oh, wow.
[235:27.62]There's four of you right there.
[235:28.86]Come on, let's go.
[235:31.94]Let's go, Wizard of Oz crew.
[235:34.02]Nice.
[235:34.86]Good Chuck.
[235:35.50]Good Chuck.
[235:36.87]CC monkey.
[235:37.65]Oh, I thought you died.
[235:45.93]Hey, sad Funda.
[235:47.99]You're in the game now.
[235:56.15]Those are fake viewers, are they?
[235:57.79]They should be here.
[235:58.33]Isn't that how it works?
[236:03.89]A horrible hallway to be in.
[236:07.03]Oh, he just got sniped.
[236:09.07]It's a really bad hallway.
[236:10.23]Actually, really horrible.
[236:11.33]Terrible.
[236:12.97]Bad hallway.
[236:13.35]Okay.
[236:19.40]Sorry, he's... You shouldn't have followed me down there.
[236:22.78]Should not have followed me down there.
[236:29.23]What's with these enemies?
[236:29.99]They're terrible.
[236:32.53]Very difficult role in the first room here.
[236:34.45]Yeah, something good.
[236:45.04]Rain cloud.
[236:46.54]Whatever.
[236:53.07]is that?
[236:53.39]Wait, that's electrifying this.
[236:55.87]New friendly ghosts.
[236:56.79]8-bit Aether and Red X Yeti.
[237:00.85]Welcome.
[237:05.45]If you guys didn't know, these are my $5,000 level Patreon tier contributors.
[237:11.99]You know, we jump in the game sometimes.
[237:16.19]Hey, give that back!
[237:18.22]Give that back, that's my- you can't just take wands.
[237:23.21]How do I get that back?
[237:27.07]Alright, give me that wand.
[237:35.89]Uh, I don't- I need money.
[237:36.79]I don't stand on that.
[237:44.27]You know what, fine, give me- whatever, just give me the wand.
[237:56.06]That's pretty good to get right now.
[237:57.10]I need health again.
[237:58.02]Where's water?
[238:03.04]No.
[238:04.42]Okay, like dilute this so I can stand in it.
[238:06.62]Okay, that looks good.
[238:13.55]I don't have that much money though, but whatever.
[238:16.41]I need health.
[238:22.11]Okay.
[238:24.27]Okay.
[238:25.75]Uh, holy shit.
[238:26.73]What is this?
[238:28.57]I wish I had money.
[238:29.31]Alright, where's the money one?
[238:31.59]Remove ground.
[238:33.09]That's great.
[238:34.37]Uh... What?
[238:37.95]Everything stays.
[238:39.27]You have angered the gods.
[238:42.69]I didn't do that, though.
[238:44.53]What?
[238:50.70]What is this?
[238:51.04]I don't know.
[238:51.72]Give me this!
[239:10.08]It's just... It's just war and peace with you guys.
[239:14.14]Hot and cold.
[239:15.16]Fire and ice.
[239:15.91]There's a thousand dollars.
[239:21.49]You're Satan.
[239:33.98]Somebody said, I feel bad now.
[239:39.20]Oh, I see a health plus on there at number three.
[239:45.39]That's a good one.
[239:46.05]Alright, can you guys just give me a god run so I can get to the end of the game?
[239:52.28]I've gotten to the second to last floor.
[239:55.08]I can't beat it.
[239:56.90]Give me a god run so I can just smoke every floor.
[240:10.25]Is that a bad thing or a good thing?
[240:22.38]I have to kill this to spite you guys.
[240:39.81]I think it just, last time this, I, wait, wasn't there, did I get the chest?
[240:44.41]I don't even know.
[240:45.49]Drink the blood, drink the blood, drink the blood, drink, okay, fine, I'll drink blood.
[240:52.34]Alright, I drank the blood.
[241:06.39]Why am I still on fire?
[241:15.14]Ooh, what's this?
[241:16.46]Fireball.
[241:17.22]Yeah, I'll take it.
[241:23.48]He's stuck down here.
[241:24.14]Alright, drink his blood.
[241:25.42]Alright, drink his blood.
[241:30.27]You're seeing things more clearly.
[241:31.51]I can't...
[241:44.31]Fuck it.
[241:44.87]Let's go.
[241:45.29]Nearby materials transmute into acid.
[241:58.72]You know, okay.
[241:59.52]Twitch integration sounds like a good idea.
[242:02.54]But I think it only works out if I activate it on the third floor or something.
[242:07.78]Because I don't even have any items.
[242:16.24]I thought it was gonna be gold.
[242:17.43]Oh, oh well.
[242:22.05]You can disable things that you don't want.
[242:23.96]Oh, but that's fun to mess around.
[242:41.53]I see a couple of options that I like on there.
[242:43.97]I'm not going to... I will not influence the vote.
[242:47.43]But I'm just telling you, at least... I swear to God.
[242:50.59]I didn't even look at what it was.
[242:52.35]It's a rocket.
[242:52.91]I thought it was a bomb.
[243:02.01]Already right at the bat.
[243:03.07]Okay, I got to get up there.
[243:08.15]50 HP.
[243:08.59]Holy shit.
[243:09.09]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[243:10.02]Give me another one of those.
[243:10.80]More.
[243:15.50]Okay.
[243:16.08]This looks like it's going to be the run.
[243:18.29]If you understand.
[243:18.79]This looks like it's going to be the run.
[243:21.17]Double spark.
[243:27.07]Super cast speed.
[243:27.95]This is the one.
[243:31.08]It is.
[243:31.54]So don't mess this up.
[243:34.72]You know what to do.
[243:44.05]You know what to do.
[243:44.67]Look at this.
[243:45.15]It's so good.
[243:47.51]It's unbelievable.
[243:48.55]It's very, very, very, very good.
[244:01.46]Get out of the way.
[244:02.28]Fire.
[244:02.60]Something else?
[244:12.53]This looks like another wand in here.
[244:20.92]Holy shit, this thing sucks.
[244:29.36]This is the worst wand of the entire game I've played so far.
[244:38.89]Yes.
[244:39.81]Shuffle.
[244:41.90]0.5 recharge time.
[244:44.42]Whatever, just take it.
[244:49.47]What am I getting here?
[244:50.51]What are we doing?
[244:51.21]Treasure rain.
[244:51.89]Hell yeah.
[244:55.47]No, no.
[244:55.81]Bad place for it.
[244:56.53]Bad place to do this.
[245:00.58]Get all the big ones.
[245:04.36]Come on.
[245:04.94]There's another big one over here.

[245:52.19]No begging, kill him.
[245:55.23]Wait, you want me to beg?
[246:05.76]We want you to beg.
[246:07.10]Hold here.
[246:18.08]I don't even know what Twitchy is.
[246:20.14]But I feel like it's not good.
[246:21.88]And I feel like I don't want it.
[246:27.66]Loot.
[246:29.54]Look at you guys working together here.
[246:32.16]It's a beautiful thing.
[246:39.55]And that's a mega wand.
[246:44.05]It's purple.
[246:44.45]Purple.
[246:48.82]Triple spell propane tank.
[246:51.84]Propane tank, propane tank, propane tank, propane tank.
[246:56.43]It's a mega wand.
[246:57.45]I don't even know what that means.
[246:59.17]It shoots ten propane tanks?
[247:02.09]Wait.
[247:04.95]It shoots two at the- Okay, so it's gonna shoot four at a time.
[247:07.89]I feel like that's gonna come in not very much handy soon.
[247:13.82]I just need to see what it does.
[247:19.56]Holy shit.
[247:22.30]Okay.
[247:22.98]That's... I don't... Okay.
[247:24.92]Okay.
[247:25.12]It hurts being in that.
[247:25.92]I don't know if that... I don't like it.
[247:27.90]I don't want it.
[247:28.26]Is this all gas?
[247:37.19]It hurts if I touch it.
[247:56.02]Do not do one.
[247:58.58]Ow!
[248:02.85]Don't do one.
[248:03.97]Do not do one.
[248:05.05]Don't do it.
[248:06.19]I'm gonna wait and see what you guys do because there's a health pack right here.
[248:11.17]Excess thank you.
[248:11.88]I got money.
[248:18.48]Triplicate bolt?
[248:22.90]Triplicate bolt.
[248:27.30]I don't want to see what it does.
[248:29.86]Teleporting cast.
[248:30.92]Don't want it.
[248:32.04]Bubble spark.
[248:34.36]And, hold on, wait.
[248:36.96]I can do another bubble spark here.
[248:45.40]Wait.
[248:47.73]Does this work?
[248:55.77]Kind of like a shotgun.
[249:01.91]Oh, it needs mana.
[249:03.45]It needs too much mana.
[249:10.71]That's so good.
[249:17.29]Wand 4 has mana cast.
[249:20.53]Wait, hold on.
[249:21.45]You're saying switch this?
[249:39.49]No.

[249:50.82]Oh, thanks.
[249:52.06]What does this do?
[249:56.20]I think that's alright.
[249:57.10]No, it's not.
[249:59.27]Too much mana.
[250:04.57]This is perfect.
[250:07.14]At all on the fourth wand.
[250:10.62]You're wasting immortality.

[253:10.27]Why is there poison in here?
[253:13.81]What is this?
[253:16.49]What is this Star Trek beam?
[253:18.83]And why is it filling the entire game?
[253:38.44]Oh, shit.
[253:41.00]Get rid of this.
[253:41.56]How do I get rid of that fire?
[253:42.73]I don't know what that is.
[253:44.55]Okay, I'm gonna...
[253:50.80]That was... Jesus.
[253:53.10]No, it's gonna follow me up here.
[254:03.11]You know what I think when I see that?
[254:04.67]I just think of, like, a soda.
[254:06.19]When you pour a coke for the first time.
[254:08.45]What on Earth?
[254:09.77]Summon egg.
[254:11.93]Summon a shitload of eggs?
[254:14.48]With fire?
[254:14.84]Fire?
[254:26.34]This is, I just, it's a friend gun.
[254:30.96]Holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[254:32.63]Okay, let's go.
[254:38.87]I'm just gonna be a Diablo II necromancer.
[254:44.73]Thanks for the 80 HP.
[254:50.11]It's recharging.
[254:51.59]Oh, I have too many people out.
[254:58.78]Alright, there's too much shit on the screen right now, and I need to douse myself.
[255:03.74]What is shooting at me?
[255:06.00]Too much on the screen.
[255:06.72]Way too much on the screen.
[255:07.50]I have no idea what's going on.
[255:10.39]I gotta turn, like, the particles down.
[255:13.17]I have absolutely no fucking idea what's happening.
[255:17.05]Are they shooting me?
[255:21.27]What the fuck is going on?
[255:23.91]Put me out!
[255:24.69]Put me out!
[255:25.69]Put me out!
[255:27.02]Put me out!
[255:28.42]Put me out!
[255:28.76]Put me out!
[255:30.30]Go into the water!
[255:42.57]Alright.
[255:49.43]It's too all over the place.
[255:50.85]I can't do it.
[255:52.85]I can't do it.
[255:53.31]Now give me a shielding gook.
[255:58.69]So, hold on a minute.
[256:00.07]What was going on there?
[256:02.43]Someone's an egg that houses a friendly creature.
[256:04.65]Don't just give it to the fire thing?
[256:07.69]Energy orb.
[256:13.15]Critical plus.
[256:15.90]Full scatter spell.
[256:20.88]Oceans appear.
[256:21.40]Are those good?
[256:25.18]These are.
[256:26.98]This better not kill me when I'm done.
[256:33.36]What is this Skittles one down here?
[256:34.68]Okay, should I eat the Skittles?
[256:40.90]No, I'm not eating anything.
[256:41.82]I'm not touching any of this shit.
[256:43.44]I kind of have to go this way.
[256:53.33]Controls are backwards.
[256:54.21]Get out of here.
[257:02.46]Drink it all?
[257:15.82]I can't leave.
[257:16.71]Okay, get... Wait.
[257:18.77]I think I... I have explosives, right?
[257:25.27]Don't... What are you doing?
[257:35.74]Why did it aim back at me?
[257:38.18]You have angered the gods.
[257:39.36]I didn't do anything.
[257:40.50]I'm trying to leave.
[257:43.58]Please let me leave.
[257:44.63]Blow up this thing over here.
[257:52.57]Be angry, but it's going to collapse, isn't it?
[257:54.39]Your projectiles leave a trail of water.
[257:58.47]I can't even move.
[258:07.51]Oh shit, there he is!
[258:09.31]He's so mad.
[258:12.97]He can't even get in here though.
[258:13.93]This is so anti-climactic.
[258:19.34]Oh no, he's charmed.
[258:20.70]He's having problems too.
[258:22.54]Drink it!
[258:23.02]I'm drinking it!
[258:26.14]Go left?
[258:35.92]Hold on, the controls are backwards.
[258:38.58]Wait.
[258:40.12]What just happened?
[258:40.62]Oh my god, where am I?
[258:52.33]Uh, okay.
[258:52.81]I think we're okay?
[259:08.17]Dude, I'm... Okay, we need to slow down.
[259:10.83]I need to slow down.
[259:14.81]And give me, um... Health.
[259:18.05]HP.
[259:24.66]There's a golden wand in here.
[259:25.68]Is it electrified?
[259:27.26]This is electrified.
[259:29.18]Shoot it.
[259:38.63]Fuck.
[259:38.97]No, just... It's electrified.
[259:42.54]I don't want to touch when it's electricity.
[259:48.78]I want a crew.
[259:49.36]How come they're not... What's wrong?
[259:56.31]Why are they not summoning anything?
[260:15.77]Who is good and who is bad?
[260:17.25]I don't know.
[260:23.49]Okay, health.
[260:27.17]Health pack.
[260:32.82]Don't shoot the friendly.
[260:33.62]They turn hostile.
[260:34.46]That's going to be hard to do.
[260:38.92]Don't shoot the friendlies.
[260:40.28]Good luck.
[260:40.96]There's like 15 of them.
[260:48.39]I don't even know what just happened.
[261:01.88]Your friend killed you.
[261:02.92]Alright.
[261:06.71]I'm so addicted to this game, but I will never complete it.
[261:09.47]I will be honest with you.
[261:19.01]I don't know what's wrong with my mind.
[261:20.63]I thought that just said expired nuts.
[261:25.64]For a second.
[261:37.40]I like the start on one.
[261:39.89]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[261:58.41]Did you guys do that or did I do that?
[262:00.89]I don't know.
[262:07.83]I don't know what you guys just did, but this fucked me all up.
[262:14.95]Take cover, boom.
[262:20.84]Too much fire on this map.
[262:32.59]I'm just getting out.
[262:33.61]Just get me out of here.
[262:35.39]I don't like that map.
[262:36.41]Didn't like the spawn rate.
[262:37.35]Didn't like any of it.
[262:41.45]Burning trail.
[262:44.19]Explosion.
[262:47.56]Should I?
[262:48.12]Hold on.
[262:50.40]Explosion for this one?
[263:03.72]It just explodes when you press the button.
[263:11.43]Of course it does.
[263:15.73]Now I don't have any more money.
[263:17.66]So we're just gonna go.
[263:18.44]You need a projectile on it.
[263:26.84]What the fuck?
[263:28.10]I just put it on.
[263:29.18]You have trouble contro-
[263:32.04]Turn it off.
[263:32.44]Turn it off.
[263:33.16]Get this off.
[263:33.98]Get it off.
[263:34.28]Get it off the bar.
[263:34.88]Get it off the hot bar.
[263:41.01]Projectile duplication.
[263:43.17]Stainless armor.
[263:48.01]I feel like these both are good.
[263:53.95]You take 50% less damage as long as you don't have any stains on you.
[263:57.86]I'm assuming that I have stains on me right now.
[264:01.96]How do you get rid of stains?
[264:11.25]Oh, you use OxiClean.
[264:12.77]I need to walk around.
[264:25.11]Okay, I take 50% less damage as long as I don't have any stains.
[264:44.30]What should we play tomorrow?
[264:46.80]Any ideas?
[264:47.20]I'm dead.
[264:48.42]Let's spawn while it lasts.
[264:49.10]Okay, cool.
[264:49.32]What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[264:55.82]More of this?
[264:56.70]No, I can't do more of this.
[264:57.76]I'm not good at this.
[265:06.20]I love this game.
[265:07.86]I love everything it stands for.
[265:09.64]I love what it is and I love all what it's about.
[265:15.28]I need like two people to play this.
[265:17.25]I need to split my body in half and have one person control the aiming and the shooting and one person to move around.
[265:23.49]Does anybody get that?
[265:28.13]It's like aiming at the enemies and I got to shoot those guys and watch out for the projectiles that are right here.
[265:33.71]I need to split myself in half and have one person have the mouse and one person have the WASD.
[265:43.43]Because two people need to pay attention in this.
[265:47.80]It's focusing on where an enemy is and aiming and shooting at him.
[265:49.96]And then watch out, there's a projectile going to hit you in the face.
[265:53.29]What was that?
[265:55.79]Oh.
[265:56.73]That was not bad.
[265:59.83]It's called motor skills?
[266:03.74]Hey, I beat Dark Souls.
[266:05.04]Hey, no, excuse me.
[266:06.16]I beat Sekiro, last boss, on stream.
[266:10.00]You know some streamers that fucking gave up on that.
[266:11.78]I beat that on stream.
[266:13.52]Final, true final boss of Sekiro, I beat it on stream.
[266:16.76]With less than like 50 attempts.
[266:19.34]So, I mean, motor skills, I don't know if that's what it is.
[266:26.89]Played Binding of Isaac.
[266:27.63]Yeah, and I did very well.
[266:29.39]But Binding of Isaac is a little different.
[266:30.74]Because Binding of Isaac is... It's like zoomed in.
[266:35.56]It's easier to like... Because an enemy over here could like shoot a projectile that moves like this and hit you.
[266:41.85]While I have to pay attention like in this sphere here.
[266:44.05]Like I need to be... It's not just like a cube this big.
[266:46.59]Like Isaac is.
[266:58.83]The game's very good.
[266:59.73]Like, this is a very good game.
[267:03.55]I find it to be very, very fun and very challenging and very interesting.
[267:15.98]I already know what you guys are gonna pick.
[267:18.48]And it's making me very upset.
[267:26.49]Though, in that case, I'm going to just run to the exit.
[267:31.17]Oh, he's not even invisible.
[267:37.85]He's just kind of... sort of opacity dragged down.
[267:53.08]Scammed?
[267:53.53]Kind of.
[267:56.10]A little bit, yeah.
[268:06.64]Who's trying to talk to me?
[268:08.24]That's a lot of money, but I can't go get it.
[268:13.29]Ow!
[268:13.51]I told you I couldn't go get it.
[268:14.65]I told you I couldn't go get it.
[268:15.81]Please put me out.
[268:20.91]No!
[268:29.76]Play Fallout 2?
[268:34.36]No, no thanks.
[268:40.35]It's a good game, but I'm just not really into it at the moment.
[268:43.93]Bubble Spark is my favorite one.
[268:46.81]Vertical Barrier, that's a good one.
[268:48.39]Luminous Drill.
[268:49.43]Ooh, what should I get?
[268:50.83]Definitely Bubble Spark.
[268:52.21]Definitely Luminous Drill.
[268:53.62]Definitely Vertical Barrier.
[268:57.21]Okay, two in town for fuck's sake.
[268:58.43]Alright, time that guy out for like five seconds.
[269:04.66]A thin vertical barrier that harms passing creatures including you.
[269:14.42]Okay.
[269:18.76]That's... I can put that up in front of me.
[269:21.11]That will cast first.
[269:22.47]Now let's shuffle.
[269:25.17]then bubble spark and luminous drill I don't know what happened it harms you if it I aimed like what it put it puts it like right where you spawn where you're standing
[269:56.02]I know, but I didn't I didn't think it was gonna like instantly kill me I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know It's a static projectile right, but like I thought it was gonna be like where I aimed the cursor Like it would place it like in front of me or something where I put the cursor not just like right where I am But did it I don't know you cause of death you are dead oh
[270:27.52]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[270:32.28]No.
[270:32.94]Do a mayo making stream tomorrow?
[270:56.66]Alright, let's get, let's, I need to get back to the, what's it, the Hisi temple or something?
[271:04.16]I got there once, and then I had one more floor to go, but it was crazy, I couldn't do it.
[271:13.15]I guess you said mayo, now I, you know what I want right now?
[271:14.95]I just want a turkey sandwich.
[271:17.17]I want a turkey sandwich with thinly sliced turkey breast.
[271:19.59]A layer of nice, just nice, thick, hearty mayo.
[271:31.04]Maybe one just slice of avocado.
[271:34.40]Just a thin slice of avocado.
[271:36.28]Nice piece of, like, American cheese on it.
[271:41.26]Cheddar cheese, maybe.
[271:42.03]Piece of big crispy lettuce.
[271:49.37]Or, you know, how about a chicken cutlet sandwich?
[271:52.25]With a big crispy piece of lettuce on it.
[271:54.85]And... Squeeze of mayo.
[271:57.44]All you need.
[272:02.65]I have this theory that people say gross to American cheese to people that pretend to hate McDonald's and then eat it like three times a week.
[272:08.85]Dude, it's gross.
[272:24.92]Well, I look, I didn't say, hey, this is the, of course it's gross.
[272:32.15]But it's still, I'd still like to eat it.
[272:33.69]Bomb?
[272:47.44]But why?
[272:47.84]I mean, just because things are a little sloppy and a little, you know, not the best thing in the world doesn't mean you don't like to have it from time to time.
[272:58.72]If that were the case, the alcohol industry wouldn't exist.
[273:10.78]Portal to someplace.
[273:11.84]Do you guys just teleport me to the... This is the run.
[273:17.27]This is... No, it's not.
[273:18.51]I'm taking a ton of damage.
[273:22.19]This is not the run.
[273:23.68]This is not the run at all.
[273:25.18]These are all late game enemies that just instantly killed me.
[273:47.26]Stage 3 is late game.
[273:48.56]Alright, but hold on.
[273:49.70]Did you see how many people were spawned?
[273:56.84]There's like 12 people around me.
[274:00.96]This is the run?
[274:01.55]Alright, if I do not get to the floor... Okay, you ready for this one?
[274:05.51]Ooh, you guys like bets.
[274:07.67]You guys call me the gambler.
[274:08.67]You guys like them a lot more than I do.
[274:11.29]If I do not get to the bottom of this room, I will give 100 community subs.
[274:17.51]of this room here.
[274:18.49]I'm freaking the fuck out, hold on.
[274:51.68]I'm gonna shut the fuck up for this one.
[275:55.08]Give me that.
[275:55.50]Give me that.
[275:59.12]What?
[275:59.42]What?
[275:59.86]What?
[276:08.10]Okay.
[276:08.52]They're gonna do three.
[276:09.80]They're gonna do three.
[276:10.38]I think that's a boss.
[276:11.79]They're gonna do three.
[276:12.31]It's a boss.
[276:12.71]Yeah.
[276:25.65]Good game, good game, man.
[276:36.32]Do it again?
[276:36.78]Fine.
[276:39.86]If I don't get to the bottom of the next one, I'll get 50 subs.
[276:43.62]It cuts in half every time because I keep winning.
[276:54.81]We're gonna go.
[276:55.57]Now.
[276:58.25]Blast cannon.
[276:59.34]Peace with the gods.
[277:00.60]Or plague rats.
[277:01.30]Peace with the gods.
[277:01.86]I don't know what that means, but I just know it's probably not bad.
[277:07.25]I have to go now.
[277:36.85]Fucking die already!
[277:38.39]Oh my goodness.
[277:45.74]What happened?
[277:46.30]What happened?
[277:46.68]What happened?
[277:47.12]What happened?
[277:47.54]I don't know what happened.
[277:48.62]I have no idea what's going on.
[277:49.90]What happened?
[277:50.22]Why did that happen?
[277:51.80]Uh-oh, they're gonna drown me with these potions.
[277:55.48]They're gonna do with the fucked up potion thing.
[277:58.34]Hurry, hurry, get up.
[277:59.50]Hurry and get up.
[277:59.98]Hurry and get up.
[278:00.48]Get up.
[278:01.34]Get up.
[278:01.52]Get up.
[278:01.66]Get up.
[278:01.92]Get up.
[278:02.14]Get up.
[278:16.39]Scammed.
[278:16.73]You picked it.
[278:17.23]I didn't.
[278:18.05]That's your own fault.
[278:19.83]Should have looked at the fine print.
[278:21.31]Drop it.
[278:36.36]Drop it.
[278:37.84]Safe.
[278:39.16]Drop it.
[278:41.37]Drop it.
[278:47.56]Actual NA aim.
[278:48.90]Like, I seriously.
[278:50.16]That was bad.
[279:02.67]Good.
[279:03.03]Okay.
[279:03.63]I made it.
[279:05.11]Now it's 25.
[279:09.46]I need these wands.
[279:10.62]I haven't upgraded a wand in like 10 minutes.
[279:16.14]Chunk of soil.
[279:16.90]I can't even buy anything.
[279:24.50]Worm detractor.
[279:26.74]Bomb materialized.
[279:27.88]Electricity immune to electricity.
[279:30.45]A helpful little homunculus comes to your aid.
[279:32.17]Wow, you really don't want me to lose, do you?
[279:39.06]Thanks.
[279:40.98]That's down to 25.
[279:42.20]You know it.
[279:42.86]I know it.
[279:43.30]Let's go.
[279:47.41]Here's the remarkable thing about this.
[279:49.53]With me needing to give subs if I lose, with the default wand that I got in the beginning of the game, I've gotten further than I've gotten in the last hour.
[279:58.23]Give me a break.
[280:04.10]I haven't upgraded one of these wands.
[280:13.81]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[280:17.41]That's a lot of money.
[280:20.09]Stop spraying that shit.
[280:20.87]I need that money.
[280:23.03]What happened?
[280:25.81]Oh, I took a little extra damage.
[280:30.10]I didn't know you take extra damage when you're, uh... Oh, there's your 25 subs.
[280:34.78]Hold on.
[280:42.46]Doing it, I'm doing it.
[280:47.09]Sub it up.
[280:47.55]It's not 100, but it's 25.
[280:49.91]A up.
[280:50.03]Gift.
[280:50.13]Gift.
[280:50.27]25 subs.
[280:50.43]A custom quantity.
[280:50.81]35.
[280:50.83]Take it or leave it.
[281:15.44]Wait.
[281:16.12]Hold on a minute.
[281:17.90]35, like, right now.
[281:19.20]Like, start over.
[281:20.21]Double or nothing.
[281:22.57]You got it.
[281:23.11]Let's go.
[281:23.41]50 subs.
[281:25.33]Double or nothing.
[281:25.77]Let's do it.
[281:26.41]Floor one.
[281:26.87]Floor number one.
[281:28.79]Here we go.
[281:31.89]Double or nothing.
[281:33.14]Floor one.
[281:42.32]And by the way, I'm going to make this fair.
[281:44.48]I made this fair.
[281:44.94]I'm not going to move until you guys get to vote.
[281:48.82]The couple is 50.
[281:49.48]It is.
[282:04.23]All these options are not very bad at all.
[282:07.87]There's no summon gigaworm, right guys?
[282:27.12]Slimy.
[282:27.60]Ooh, slime.
[282:28.38]Everyone gets covered in slime.
[282:29.80]No, don't slime me!
[282:31.91]Uh, I don't even know what this is, but I'm gonna pick it up.
[282:46.12]Get slimed, bitch.
[282:50.04]Okay.
[282:53.87]I don't even know why.
[282:54.86]Like, right now, like, that didn't do anything to me.
[282:58.56]That doesn't get you closer to the 50 community subs.
[283:00.92]But that person was just so ready to say that.
[283:04.72]Like, yeah, fuck this guy.
[283:06.66]That didn't help us.
[283:07.66]Oh, well, whatever.
[283:08.34]Still, get slime.
[283:09.46]Okay, hold on.
[283:24.80]How many water?
[283:26.98]Brine?
[283:28.12]That's water, right?
[283:29.20]Salt water.
[283:40.95]Don't touch that.
[283:42.53]Don't touch that.
[283:43.01]Don't touch that, you idiot.
[283:44.81]Don't touch that.
[283:55.32]What are these?
[283:56.04]Acid trail, fire trail, transportation barrel.
[283:57.32]I don't know what these are.
[283:59.88]I gotta get through a safe space.
[284:00.80]A safe place.
[284:01.56]Safe.
[284:02.10]This is not safe.
[284:02.70]That's not safe.
[284:03.22]That's not safe.
[284:03.69]That's not safe.
[284:09.81]Got it.
[284:10.17]Yes.
[284:17.65]Oh, they want a double or nothing again, don't they?
[284:20.02]Want another double or nothing.
[284:21.54]Back to 100.
[284:22.12]Hmm.
[284:24.72]That's not how that works.
[284:26.30]Nope, we go down to 25 again.
[284:33.12]Brimstone.
[284:35.28]Summon hollow egg.
[284:38.22]What is brimstone?
[284:42.00]Fiery explosion.
[284:49.70]Does it work on here?
[284:55.41]If you win this one, chat has to give you a kiss.
[285:06.87]Melee immunity.
[285:08.52]Extra health or explosion immunity.
[285:10.28]Okay.
[285:11.76]Okay.
[285:20.08]Let's go.
[285:20.48]Wait, I'm on fire.
[285:22.74]I'm not fire immune.
[285:42.95]Hostile ghosts, okay.
[285:45.05]Watch it.
[285:50.56]Why am I on fire?
[286:03.95]This is such a dog shit setup too.
[286:05.59]I have the list.
[286:06.39]This is so bad.
[286:08.49]This is the worst setup ever.
[286:10.07]I didn't even pay attention because I thought you guys would drop like lava.
[286:12.25]I gotta go now.
[286:20.06]Oh fuck.
[286:33.31]No!
[286:33.67]Wrong button!

[287:17.52]Armed creature.
[287:18.64]A nearby creature gets a random wand.
[287:20.96]Okay.
[287:21.88]Well, that's good to know.
[287:25.66]Water trail.
[287:28.09]This wand doesn't even have anything on it.
[287:29.25]Alright, well, whatever.
[287:31.67]Wait, do I only have... What's the best for this?
[287:34.19]0.22, 0.33.
[287:35.57]Terrible mana.
[287:36.13]It's awful.
[287:47.23]Oh, 250.
[287:52.07]0.5.
[287:52.15]Hold on a minute.
[288:02.32]Water.
[288:06.04]Ooh, that's cool looking.
[288:10.82]Wait a minute, this is not a good idea.
[288:15.53]Okay, I can drown.
[288:17.81]I kind of like, wait, did I just screw everything up?
[288:24.04]Fire immunity.
[288:26.46]It's over.
[288:28.17]I can just blow myself up down the whole hallway.
[288:40.32]What's the best for that, though?
[288:41.24]0.5.
[288:42.70]0.5 max mana.
[288:45.83]This one, probably, right?
[288:52.92]Guys, bring him on!
[288:53.92]Bring him on!
[288:54.40]Bring the worm on!
[289:17.97]I can just dig straight down.
[289:25.61]Okay, I just need to be able to get to the bottom.
[289:36.16]Sniper down here.
[289:37.82]Oh, that was a worm.
[289:38.54]I'm good.
[289:40.54]I just need to...
[289:45.50]What do I hear?
[289:46.97]What is that?
[289:48.35]Get down!
[289:48.85]Now you're down to, what?
[289:58.66]5.5? 5.6?
[290:14.11]This is the best one, because I can just go right down and go- Hello?
[290:21.49]Where did you come from?
[290:32.46]All projectiles eat the ground?
[290:34.14]I can't even move.
[290:37.70]This sucks.
[290:39.64]This is not even fair.
[290:41.92]Wait!
[291:03.95]No!
[291:06.25]What?
[291:09.41]I thought I was immune to explosions.
[291:12.39]I was immune to explosions.
[291:18.43]How am I... I was immune to fire and immune to explosions.
[291:20.23]How do I die?
[291:22.10]Blue gas.
[291:23.22]Oh, you're immune to explosions.
[291:24.64]You're immune to fire, but you can't breathe in a little gas.
[291:30.24]Six subs.
[291:34.92]Alright, I'm just going to round it up to 10.
[291:36.72]Because that's like 6.5.
[291:42.47]Quadruple of nothing.
[291:43.47]50?
[291:45.43]Alright, 50 or nothing.
[291:47.67]And this is it.
[291:48.05]The last time I'm doing this.
[291:53.94]50 or nothing right now.
[292:05.76]I'm gonna wait.
[292:27.91]That's bad.
[292:29.23]I already see what it says.
[292:30.29]I gotta get the fuck out of here now.
[292:35.90]Wait, there's a wand over here.
[292:40.04]Who cares about the wand?
[292:40.96]There's poison everywhere.
[292:41.80]Uh-oh, bad.
[292:42.57]Very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad.
[292:44.51]Go.
[292:45.59]Oh, this is a terrible place for this.
[292:51.91]Shit.
[292:53.29]Oh, shit.

[292:56.37]Uh, alright.
[292:57.09]I gotta...
[293:07.75]New wand.
[293:08.11]What is it?
[293:10.47]Kind of sucks.
[293:12.85]Chest right there.
[293:13.57]Perfect.

[293:18.27]Good.
[293:18.67]Let's go.
[293:29.63]I'm not gonna drown.
[293:30.63]Why would I drown?
[293:35.65]Stop moving.
[293:40.12]What, to give you guys a chance?
[293:40.98]Alright, fine.
[293:56.09]I'll even wait till 10 seconds.
[294:20.10]I want water.
[294:20.76]I don't want this potion.
[294:23.58]Projectiles leave a trail of poison.
[294:25.24]Alright.
[294:25.68]That's fine.
[294:26.18]I don't want this.
[294:27.02]I want water.

[299:07.90]By the way, why not, um... We're currently no longer on any bets at the moment.
[299:12.88]What?
[299:16.57]Hey, you just... Skate Tone just killed the fish.
[299:25.89]I didn't... Five second timer.
[299:30.68]It's the five second timer.
[299:34.04]You guys don't even see it on screen.
[299:36.59]It's too late.
[299:38.13]It's gotta be like ten seconds.
[299:44.80]Alright, this last one is gonna be... I can't even buy anything.
[299:47.92]Uh, I guess I can get this one?
[299:57.56]What, does it even matter?
[299:58.40]Okay, if I die here, then... No.
[300:06.72]What does worm... Worms find you attractive.
[300:08.82]Good luck.
[300:12.65]Okay, here we go.
[300:13.87]If I make it to the bottom, if I do not make it to the bottom here, then all bets are off.
[300:20.55]A huge body of random liquid?
[300:32.27]Wait, what is going on?
[300:36.36]They're on my team?
[300:41.26]Make it 12.
[300:41.92]Alright, for 12.5 subs, if I get to the bottom, I... I... I don't... I don't even... I don't know.
[300:47.84]I don't know.
[300:49.40]I don't know.
[300:50.02]I'm confused right now.
[300:51.08]I don't know what's happening.
[300:54.77]What did I just go?
[300:55.27]Okay.
[300:58.29]What am I spraying?
[301:11.88]Okay, um, I think I'm doing okay.
[301:15.40]Sniper!
[301:16.70]Oh no, I gotta give 12.5.
[301:18.18]Let's just round it up to 15 so it's easier.
[301:20.76]Times 10 or nothing.
[301:25.46]Oh, that's it.
[301:41.57]Times 10.
[301:46.42]That would be 120.
[301:48.26]No, no, I'm done.
[301:53.36]That's it.
[301:53.72]I'm done.
[301:59.51]Here, I'm gonna give 20 community subs right now.
[302:13.25]We'll go in the middle there somewhere.
[302:24.03]Now, if I just gave 20, what if we 50x'd that?
[302:38.54]This is no longer even a Noita stream anymore, this is just... Gambling for community subs on random shit that I've- it's- this is not even- I'm not even playing the game anymore.
[302:50.89]I- I told you this was gonna happen too, didn't I?
[302:54.15]I knew this was gonna happen.
[302:57.70]That's why I waited so long to do this, because you knew this is what was gonna happen.
[303:01.76]This is a pretty good start though.
[303:11.96]I'm coming alive?
[303:12.66]Nearby things turn into acid?
[303:16.70]Okay.
[303:21.30]Okay, what's happening?
[303:22.81]What's happening?
[303:24.79]What is shooting out of me?
[303:26.59]This is bad.
[303:40.11]I never agreed to that.
[303:42.13]I said imagine.
[303:43.53]I said we were done with the betting.
[303:49.47]That's 5,000!
[303:50.29]Yeah, I said what if we- I said what if we 50 times that.
[303:55.37]I didn't say this is 50 times-ing it.
[304:01.55]I said, oh, imagine.
[304:05.98]I said no more betting.
[304:07.62]I said it was over after I gave the 20.
[304:10.46]I never agreed to anything, Mr. Nixon.
[304:12.38]No, that's true.
[304:29.58]The house always wins.
[304:31.96]When it feels like it.
[304:35.48]Okay, how about this one, guys?
[304:37.90]This is not me saying imagine, by the way.
[304:39.54]This is me saying, I'm not saying like, oh, imagine if I said, oh, dude, what if it was, no.
[304:44.24]If I do not walk in the portal of this room, if I do not walk in the portal in this room, I'm, hold on, before I say anything, let me make sure I have an opportunity to do that.
[304:55.57]If I do not walk in the, okay, if I don't walk in this portal, if I do not walk in this portal, I will give 100,000 community subs.
[305:13.40]Okay, the shower energy.
[305:14.28]I'm good.
[305:18.98]Look at the map?
[305:19.98]What do you mean look at the map?
[305:28.41]What map?
[305:32.69]He didn't walk in.
[305:33.35]No, we're not gonna play semantics.
[305:35.95]I went in.
[305:37.75]I walked in.
[305:38.65]You can't play semantics right now.
[305:46.09]If I do not make it down this chute right here and live to tell the tale, then I will give 500,000 community subs.
[305:53.51]Okay.
[305:56.27]Imagine if I went right into lava.
[306:06.02]Yeah, no more betting, no more betting.
[306:08.74]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[306:17.48]Oh, there was a time when I fell down the hole and bet a bunch of community subs, but it turned out in my favor.
[306:25.72]I won.
[306:26.02]There you go.
[306:26.74]I win.
[306:26.96]Okay, if I do not direct hit the next enemy, if I do not hit the next enemy directly, then I will get 500 million community subs.
[306:46.34]By the way, I didn't fire a shot yet.
[306:47.68]I just want everyone to be very clear about this.
[306:49.93]I did not even fire a shot.
[306:51.01]I said the next enemy.
[306:52.63]The next enemy that I fire at.
[306:56.43]I didn't say it had to be a lot.
[306:57.47]I didn't say when.
[306:58.31]I just said the next shot, the next enemy.
[307:15.41]I didn't fire a shot.
[307:16.29]I did not say I have to do it in this life.
[307:18.33]I just said the next enemy that I shoot at, I have to hit.
[307:20.73]500 million community subs.
[307:26.14]How much money is that actually, though?
[307:28.04]Like, how much actually is that?
[307:48.22]Two and a half billion dollars.
[308:04.73]But I forgot to say after that, that community subs in JermaLand, it's a new game that I have coming out soon.
[308:12.72]It's a new game where we sit here and we pretend that we're all part of a giant world.
[308:17.40]And I give two, and a community sub in JermaLand is one quarter of a tenth of a quarter of one tenth of one quarter of one cent.
[308:26.09]So, if you do the math out, and this new JermaLand,
[308:35.03]I forgot to add that to the end of that billion dollars. Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[308:48.96]I was so scared.
[308:54.00]Streamer owes chat two and a half billion dollars.
[308:58.26]No, but I forgot to put the amend- the- the- the- the- addendum there.
[309:01.00]That this is- we're in the Jerma985 fun land.
[309:05.00]And on Jerma fun land every uh dollar is worth a quarter of a tenth of cent of a penny of a quarter of a penny of a quarter of a cent.
[309:13.00]So, I mean we're- it's kind of like when you're on the moon.
[309:19.92]It's kind of like when you're on the moon and the gravity is like different.
[309:22.89]It's kind of like that.
[309:24.03]I'm in Jerma land right now, so this is like my rules.
[309:26.73]I'm in my own land.
[309:27.59]It's a quarter of a tenth of a quarter percent.
[309:29.53]So, $2.5 billion turns out to actually be where I am here when you do the conversion here.
[309:37.19]It turns out to be another 50 community sub.
[309:38.87]There you are.
[309:39.27]I didn't tell you that.
[309:57.23]imagine if like alright we like obviously we're making I hey but wait a second hold on a minute folks hold on just a minute folks wait just a second here I did say that all the bets were over and there was no more betting and this was all just for fun I said there was no more bets I said that I said it was over we're not doing bets anymore so that was a fun one that was a joke one I did say that beforehand
[310:29.76]I did say, I did say, alright, we're not doing betting anymore, no more bets.
[310:33.50]And then I said, oh, 500 million subs, right?
[310:36.07]Like, that was a joke.
[310:36.85]It was a joke in funny land.
[310:46.87]Semantics Andy.
[310:48.16]No, I did say, I said, bets are over, we're not doing bets anymore.
[310:51.62]And then I made like a joke, like a comedy thing.
[311:06.52]Oh, my chest is killing me.
[311:17.23]Imagine losing a $2.5 billion bet with you, chat.
[311:19.41]Oh, my fucking chest is killing me.
[311:41.01]Look, obviously, this is just a joke, right?
[311:43.06]Like, it's just for fun.
[311:44.00]But if I gave 500 million community subs, that would mean that each one of you would get, like, there's 8,700 people here.
[311:56.82]If each one of you got an equal portion of that, like, each one of you would be getting, like, 650,000 subs worth of time on the channel.
[312:15.08]That's like 7,000 years.
[312:19.17]Oh my god, that's so funny.
[312:20.59]Alright.
[312:22.07]Double or nothing.
[312:23.69]Double or nothing.
[312:25.29]I will give 5 billion community subs.
[312:28.04]Double or nothing if I don't get to the bottom.
[312:32.36]Double or nothing.
[312:32.86]5 billion subs.
[312:49.88]That's official.
[312:50.58]That's official.
[312:51.20]Five billion community subs.
[312:52.62]That's official.
[312:54.92]Double or nothing.
[312:58.28]Don't go.
[312:58.84]I don't know what that is.
[313:16.61]I don't know what that is either.
[313:23.85]Oh, thank God.
[313:24.41]Thank God.
[313:25.31]I won.
[313:25.71]I win.
[313:26.23]No, I don't have to give 500 billion community subs.
[313:27.75]I don't have to give 5 billion community subs.
[313:28.93]Alright, let's try.
[313:29.45]How about triple or nothing?
[313:30.61]I'll give 30 billion community subs if I... Alright, that was official.
[313:43.14]That was official.
[313:43.56]I double or nothing.
[313:44.18]That was official.
[313:57.27]Oh, I'm so glad that I like doubled or nothing and I official did and I like that's it it's been stamped It's only official if he wins
[314:14.89]No, I told you I am gonna compromise.
[314:16.91]I'll compromise to give you the currency value of the Jerma985 currency.
[314:21.70]Which is 50 community subs.
[314:24.28]It's a tenth of a quarter of a quarter of a tenth of a quarter of a quarter of a tenth of a quarter and a frog and a log and a bog and the bottom of the sea worth of a cent.
[314:31.61]It's 50 community subs.
[314:37.35]What?
[314:39.53]Pay up what?
[314:42.50]No, I closed out that transaction.
[314:50.52]No, no, no.
[314:51.66]When I paused the game and I said, oh, no, here's what we're going to do.
[314:54.42]We're going to go previously to the tenth of a quarter over a tenth of a percent over a tenth of a quarter.
[315:05.09]Okay.
[315:06.39]Let's do 50 community cells.
[315:07.29]There you go.
[315:17.49]That's a tenth of a quarter of a tenth of a percent of a tenth of a quarter of a tenth of the frog of the log of the bog of the water of the flea of the hare of the log of the bottom of the sea.
[315:23.31]There you go.
[315:40.74]Uh, devil or nothing?
[315:41.78]No, I told you already.
[315:43.68]I told you already.
[315:44.31]Before we even did the 500 million, I said, I'm done.
[315:47.07]No more bets.
[315:48.01]It's over.
[315:50.45]I said that, and it was very clear.
[315:54.86]I said, anything going forward is just a fucking comedy routine.
[316:17.10]5 billion subs.
[316:18.80]No one even has that much money.
[316:23.72]Chat is enabling Jerma's gambling addiction.
[316:31.90]Only 499,999,950.
[316:32.18]Wait, I want to see official 30 billion.
[316:46.69]I'll get 30 billion community subs if I... If I what?
[316:51.39]If I what?
[316:53.15]Excuse me?
[316:54.31]If I what?
[316:56.91]Excuse... If I what?
[317:02.80]Didn't even say anything there.
[317:07.22]I could... I could... I could have... Alright, that was official.
[317:09.50]That was... I double or nothing.
[317:10.54]That was official.
[317:12.08]That was official.
[317:13.26]The thing that I just did was official.
[317:17.23]I never told you what we were betting on.
[317:22.64]I get 30 billion community subs if I... If I... What?
[317:27.98]And I said it was official the last one, which was double to nothing.
[317:33.03]And then this is it.
[317:34.69]I didn't say if I what.
[317:35.77]I could have said if I eat a fucking Oreo.
[317:37.95]That was official.
[317:38.43]I double or nothing.
[317:39.05]That was official.
[317:39.77]That was official.
[317:40.31]I double or nothing.
[317:40.74]That was official.
[317:41.22]Alright.
[317:42.86]I'm good.
[317:49.58]This is why I didn't want to turn this fucking thing on in the first place.
[317:52.14]Alright, turn it off.
[317:53.50]I'm doing a run on my own.
[318:16.59]I still, I think that's so funny.
[318:25.72]And here's the worst part about that.
[318:27.90]It had to be the bouncy one.
[318:30.36]If you watch that clip, it literally bounced.
[318:33.48]We were in a tiny corridor.
[318:35.42]And it bounced.
[318:38.14]Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[318:39.78]Around the guy a hundred times.
[318:47.08]What are we minus twoing?
[318:52.36]It's fun to gamble without consequences, isn't it?
[318:56.11]I mean, yeah, because, like... What, you think I would, like, actually put up a 500 million dollar bet?
[319:03.87]Put it back.
[319:08.93]Wait, wait, what is this?
[319:11.38]What are you guys linking?
[319:14.16]One fourth of... One fourth... No, no, he didn't listen closely.
[319:31.53]No, you didn't listen close enough.
[319:33.89]That's not what this is.
[319:35.33]You didn't listen close enough.
[319:42.30]One-fourth of one-tenth of a quarter of a percent is $15,625. $15,625.
[319:57.85]No, I said, you didn't hear me.
[320:00.24]You misheard me.
[320:02.84]I'm crying right now.
[320:04.60]You misheard me.
[320:05.20]I said one-fourth of one-quarter of one-tenth of one-quarter of one-tenth of a frog in the log of the bog of the bay at the bottom of the sea.
[320:30.70]What is this?
[320:31.44]Chowder?
[320:31.92]What's chowder?
[320:36.60]How much is a frog on the log on the bottom of the sea?
[320:39.24]That's the part that you're not calculating.
[320:42.79]A frog on the log on the bottom of the sea is like a dollar.
[320:46.85]So it's one fourth of one tenth of one percent of a dollar.
[320:59.68]Oh, my fucking back hurts right now from laughing at this.
[321:04.40]A dollar you haven't paid?
[321:05.28]I get 50 community subs.
[321:06.77]That's the backtrack.
[321:08.65]I can't fucking believe I missed the shot.
[321:21.21]Stop!
[321:21.61]I don't need to see the math.
[321:29.54]I don't know why this is so funny to me.
[321:31.46]Because, like, I'm just thinking if, like, somebody... Like, I'm just thinking if somebody really, like, actually made that bed.
[321:43.73]Oh.
[321:45.85]Oh.
[321:47.39]Oh, this is killing me.
[321:48.51]Oh.
[321:58.35]okay I have to stop I gotta I gotta go I think I actually have to what does this have to do with anything seriously what does this have to do with anything what does this have to do with anything what does this have to do with anything

[325:03.95]Let me say just one thing real quickly.
[325:07.15]That Joe Biden, he took the presidency, and he's going to lead us, hopefully,
[325:13.12]Gotta go direction.
[325:15.36]Ugh.
[325:21.73]That's politics.
[325:22.45]That's just... Whatever.
[325:24.25]Whatever.
[325:25.01]Look, I'm looking down the... That's the hardest I've probably laughed in at least a few weeks.
[325:34.74]At least like a month or two.
[325:38.38]Oh my goodness.
[325:39.30]Alright.
[325:40.22]I gotta leave.
[325:41.14]I gotta get out of here.
[325:42.52]I knew I should never have turned on the fucking Twitch integration.
[325:45.62]I knew it.
[325:46.06]How many subs does that give?
[325:51.88]75?
[325:53.74]That's the word.
[325:55.15]Alright.
[325:55.81]Let's go.
[325:56.31]I'm gonna go.
[326:02.84]You know what the worst part about, I mean, obviously it was like, it's a joke, right?
[326:06.27]Obviously.
[326:07.31]But, god damn it, every time I give community subs now for the rest of the time that I'm on Twitch, for the rest of the time, you know that people are going to be keeping a counter going and saying that, okay, dad, oh, wow, you gave 100 community subs, dude.
[326:20.21]Nice.
[326:20.53]Now you owe $499,800,005.
[326:22.00]It's going to be like that forever, isn't it?
[326:27.56]It is.
[326:29.38]Oh, god damn it.

[326:58.34]For the fun fake pretend gambling 500 million sub stream.
[327:01.84]Let me clarify, that was a funny joke that was not real.
[327:06.26]Okay, it was never real.
[327:08.32]Okay.
[327:12.54]I'll... No, don't do... Oh, no, no debt.
[327:14.76]No debt counter.
[327:18.44]Why did I have to miss the fucking shot?
[327:19.77]Like, why?
[327:20.87]Why?
[327:20.95]It was so easy.
[327:23.83]Okay, I'll... Ugh.
[327:27.71]Alright, can I... Alright, I'll trade you guys for a viewer's choice stream tomorrow.
[327:39.09]Was that clear?
[327:39.53]Did that clear the debt?
[327:42.27]Viewer's choice stream tomorrow.
[327:45.90]You get to pick whatever.
[327:46.54]Yeah, I'll play whatever the fuck you want.
[327:47.76]How's that sound?
[327:54.36]Not even close.
[327:55.52]No, it is.
[327:56.30]I've seen a lot of yeses.
[328:04.51]Porn week.
[328:07.30]Look, you can't take any bet I make seriously when I say that porn week is next week.
[328:12.94]Right?
[328:13.18]Nothing I say on here is real.
[328:20.43]Viewer's choice plus 100 subs.
[328:23.91]I'll think about it.
[328:31.19]Alright, alright, alright.
[328:32.96]We'll discuss our terms tomorrow in the pre-stream chat.
[328:36.38]How's that sound?
[328:38.22]We will discuss our terms.
[328:40.34]Come to a compromise.
[328:42.76]Or instead of two and a half billion dollars, I might play Doki Doki Literature Club tomorrow.
[328:49.43]Isn't that interesting?
[328:52.21]Not going to play that tomorrow.
[328:59.21]Alright.
[328:59.79]I actually have to get up and get out of here.
[329:01.67]I'm actually in pain right now.
[329:04.65]You know what threw me over the edge was the fucking huge ass picture.
[329:08.81]You put that there because you knew that people were spamming links, and you knew that you could get that in there maybe, and maybe out of the fucking thousands of people putting on links, I would click it, and I did.
[329:22.06]Okay.
[329:23.28]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[329:24.82]I gotta go.

[329:31.50]Thanks for subbing, everybody.
[329:32.94]Thanks to Jerma for those 75 community subs.
[329:37.41]From that deal we made where, you know, I said all gambling was off and no more bets.
[329:41.31]We were done with betting.
[329:42.49]And then after that, that was official and I made a funny little joke about 500 million things, you know, that we made that funny joke.
[329:52.56]This is what it's like to be a politician, isn't it?
[330:02.62]There's a new link?
[330:03.20]Let me see.
[330:09.42]The world's largest wetland is a series of bogs in the Siberia of Russia, the western side.
[330:14.42]Cost per square mile Louisiana purchase in return for $15 million or $18 per square mile.
[330:23.81]No, this is, I don't, multiply this number by 15,000.

[330:52.00]Ugh.
[330:54.60]Like you feel like the world is gonna explode.
[331:08.11]Here's a correct link.
[331:11.49]Credit fraud.
[331:12.35]It's not credit fraud.
[331:20.15]Oh my god.

[332:35.54]Okay.
[332:36.84]Alright.
[332:37.38]Okay.
[332:37.66]Is that it?
[332:38.14]Will that do it?
[332:40.56]Five more official emotes?
[332:43.29]This week.
[332:45.49]Five official sub emotes.
[332:48.06]This week.
[332:48.36]Is that a fair trade?
[332:55.54]Not this week.

[333:08.64]We're going to have five new sub emotes within the next seven to ten days.
[333:18.33]That'll wipe my debt claim.
[333:19.43]Do you agree?
[333:24.43]Ones in the chat, if you agree.
[333:32.63]A lot of ones.
[333:34.71]It looks like the majority is looking like they're ruling here.
[333:43.51]Do an ass emote or the debt's not cleared.
[333:46.65]I can't do that.
[333:47.67]That's like terms of service.

[334:19.83]I'm not going to be able to get over this.
[334:20.92]I'm going to laugh randomly about this every day for the next three or four days.
