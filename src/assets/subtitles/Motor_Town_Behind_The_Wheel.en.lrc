[00:35.66]Hello, hello, hello.
[00:36.78]How are you?
[00:37.62]What is up with you?
[00:54.41]Is this Chrono Trigger?
[00:55.61]Not yet.
[00:58.41]I wanted to check out this game a while ago.
[01:03.45]But I didn't get an opportunity to.
[01:09.60]It's called Motor Town.
[01:14.36]It is a driving game, so it'd be a fun one.
[01:18.99]After, I don't know, like a couple hours.
[01:23.03]In one to three hours from now.
[01:27.47]We'll move to Chrono Trigger and we'll do that late night Chrono Trigger.
[01:31.02]Kind of, you know.
[01:37.04]And we'll do that till I'm kind of ready to go to bed.
[01:49.02]Your gameplay is going to be decisive whether or not I get this game.
[01:53.28]Um, I don't think you should do that.
[01:55.08]I don't think you should.
[01:56.08]That shouldn't be an indicator for you.
[02:00.01]Why don't I get your live notifications?
[02:03.19]I don't know.
[02:04.97]Something's fucked up.
[02:13.03]Let's get the ads out of the way so pre-rolls can be turned off.
[02:19.51]Those should start here in a second.
[02:25.67]And I'm going to continue to get ready.
[02:27.81]Should be ready to go in four or five minutes from now.
[02:33.29]Okay.
[02:33.47]I'll be right back.
[03:49.67]I'm going to get cut off by the ads, but I just want to say one thing.
[03:52.81]I'm probably going to put a countdown on the stream for 10 minutes.
[03:56.71]Feels like that's a good, you know, 10 minute count.
[03:58.69]Here, they're coming.
[03:59.39]Okay.
[03:59.59]But for those of you that can still hear me, I think I'm in the corner, the top right corner.
[04:07.18]I think they're in the starting soon.
[04:08.50]I'm going to do 10 minute countdown.
[04:11.84]I've gone over some of the data.
[04:14.73]and getting the ads out of the way and starting the stream usually takes about seven to ten minutes I think that's good for people that are kind of just coming in and hanging out but yeah I'll be right back
[06:26.40]I think we're coming back here in about 25 seconds, which is good.
[06:29.30]I forgot you were here.
[06:44.89]I just turned the stream on five minutes ago.
[06:48.65]Of course, I'm in and out.
[06:50.41]I'm in and out during the beginning.
[06:59.17]Alright.
[07:00.49]Hello, how are you?
[07:02.81]Yeah, what I was saying during the the intro here is for me to kind of just talk some shit for like four or five minutes.
[07:11.05]And for the ads to play in the beginning.
[07:13.67]It seems like this takes exactly 7 to 10 minutes.
[07:17.47]So I think having a countdown on the top right for people that are coming in is probably good thing to have.
[07:23.07]It takes almost exactly 10 minutes for me to get started.
[07:28.86]Alright, pre-rolls are off.
[07:29.88]Let's go.
[07:32.28]Let's fuck around.
[07:33.14]This is Motor Town.
[07:36.70]This game, I've wanted to play it for a while.
[07:38.59]It looks pretty sick.
[07:40.79]There's a driving game and it's a... I don't know very much.
[07:43.63]I know that it's a multiple car driving game.
[07:46.63]I know that you can be... You can get like a police car.
[07:49.93]You can be a taxi driver.
[07:51.29]You can be an ambulance driver.
[07:52.96]There's a lot of shit you can do.
[07:54.12]You can do tractor trailers.
[07:56.96]I'm ready.
[08:00.72]I'm going to do private lobby.
[08:03.32]I'm just going to do it by myself for a little bit.
[08:06.35]I know you can open it up to a bunch of people, but I don't know if I'm going to do that.
[08:13.75]Alright, let's go.
[08:16.01]Here comes like goofy music.
[08:23.08]I already made my character, so it's not... Can you hear it?
[08:26.30]There you go.
[08:28.02]I already got a character.
[08:30.10]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna keep this off.
[08:33.22]It's probably not a good idea.
[08:39.25]I gotta learn how to play the game first.
[08:44.41]This is not Chrono Trigger.
[08:47.13]Look at the title!
[08:48.11]Chrono Trigger is later tonight.
[08:52.98]And yeah, I misspelled the word.
[08:54.92]I misspelled the word clowning.
[08:57.84]This is Ethel.
[09:01.39]Okay, so I guess you get a car.
[09:04.43]Oh, that mini map.
[09:06.22]Can I lock the mini map?
[09:13.38]I love Ethel.
[09:16.19]Oh, I think you get quests.
[09:17.51]Let's see.
[09:18.17]Let's talk.
[09:22.53]That sounded like there was somebody inside of my fucking room, by the way.
[09:25.49]Uh, hey, you need money, right?
[09:26.57]You can drive a pickup and do a delivery job.
[09:28.91]Just go to the warehouse.
[09:30.70]Or you can drive a taxi at the taxi office.
[09:33.10]We need some driving experience to drive a taxi.
[09:34.96]Once you have enough money in your pocket, you can buy your own vehicle and tune it.
[09:39.44]Okay.
[09:45.81]Um... Let's do... What's the easiest thing to do first?
[09:50.36]Let me just drive the car.
[09:51.38]Okay, before I do a mission, let me just make sure I know how to play the game.
[09:58.08]You can give a ride to a hitchhiker.
[09:59.88]Wait, what?
[10:08.89]I probably shouldn't go that fast.
[10:14.35]I don't know.
[10:14.97]There might not even be rules in this game.
[10:16.49]I have no idea.
[10:19.27]I know there's people, there's other drivers and shit, but you do missions.
[10:22.77]Let's pick up a, let's pick a hitchhiker up.
[10:29.51]It actually plays, it actually feels pretty good.
[10:32.01]Okay.
[10:33.73]How do I let you in?
[10:42.91]How do you pick people up?
[10:52.71]Do I have to get out of the car?
[10:53.55]Oh, here we go.
[10:55.35]Okay.
[10:56.99]I'm waiting for a taxi.
[10:59.65]What?
[11:02.15]Oh shit.
[11:02.83]That's not a taxi.
[11:03.84]Okay.
[11:04.42]I need to be a taxi.
[11:05.34]It said hitchhiker.
[11:06.78]Pick up the hitchhiker.
[11:12.00]What?
[11:14.08]Okay.
[11:14.32]Well, apparently I'm picking up Santa Claus.
[11:22.31]Oh, there we go.
[11:23.37]Could you give me a ride to where?
[11:25.13]Alright, yeah, whatever.
[11:25.89]Alright, deliver the hitchhiker.
[11:31.76]Do they care how you drive?
[11:32.94]I think there's car damage and shit.
[11:38.84]There's like a lot of stuff in this game that I was looking at.
[11:45.48]Did I stall the car already?
[12:01.89]I'm going 55.
[12:02.91]I'm losing control of the car.
[12:04.27]Oh, shit.
[12:11.42]Alright.
[12:13.66]You can't go over speed bumps like that.
[12:16.10]You got to slow way down.
[12:17.38]Alright.
[12:29.27]So this is where you want to get delivered over here.
[12:33.46]Is this like you completed the funny quest music?
[12:40.05]I got zero dollars?
[12:41.45]What?
[12:43.85]Why would I get zero dollars?
[12:47.83]You can change the vehicle's drive mode with L, B, and B. How would I get zero dollars?
[12:52.03]Did I do something wrong?
[12:55.55]You got paid in exposure.
[12:57.01]It's because you had bad driving?
[13:01.12]You got, oh, goodwill.
[13:02.54]I guess, I guess you level up?
[13:06.06]Uh, I'm gonna keep the default setting.
[13:08.58]L, B, and V is drive mode.
[13:10.18]Comfort mode is for relaxed.
[13:11.40]Automatic is higher gear.
[13:13.72]Sport mode is for racing.
[13:15.10]Automatic uses higher RPM.
[13:16.86]Okay, that's fine.
[13:21.41]Alright, so I get, let me, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do taxi driving.
[13:24.21]I feel like I should be dancing to this music, by the way.
[13:31.12]This is the kind of music that you do like the... like the Charleston 2.
[13:33.86]Alright, I gotta... where's the warehouse?
[13:39.18]Do I have a map?
[13:39.54]Alright, what am I... what do I want to do?

[20:17.76]I'll drop the sky off and then do that.
[20:27.77]That was sick.
[20:40.47]Wait, can we change cars?
[20:41.41]Hey, come out of the car and I'll swap cars.
[20:45.31]OK, I think he's fine.
[20:53.75]Teleport to your house.
[20:54.89]Alright, give me this thing.
[21:01.05]OK, find a warehouse and pick up the cargo.
[21:03.21]OK, this cargo here.
[21:11.05]You can't hit anybody, that's good.
[21:14.61]Uh... Load this.
[21:17.44]This is 2300 gold.
[21:19.38]It's a corn box.
[21:23.86]Can I load more than a few things?
[21:28.34]Carrots.
[21:30.11]And then a box.
[21:31.19]Oh shit.
[21:32.17]Um, okay.
[21:33.89]Deliver the cargo to the destination.
[21:35.17]Alright.
[21:44.37]Okay, 21% profit share.
[21:44.99]Okay.
[21:45.13]Just deliver it.
[21:45.53]Well, get away from me!
[22:17.38]Alright, let's deliver.
[22:30.04]It's all gone.
[22:30.78]I didn't know it could fall out.
[22:32.86]I didn't know it could fall out.
[22:33.98]I didn't know it could fall out.
[22:34.88]Just give me a minute.
[22:38.54]Oh, shit.
[22:39.13]Can I pick it back up?
[22:48.93]We're fine.
[22:51.88]It just got so dark in one second.
[23:04.38]Alright.
[23:04.96]The carrots are kind of everywhere, but it's fine.
[23:06.90]I'm fine.
[23:20.04]Ah, the hood's a little messed up.
[23:29.00]I love these little driving simulator games.
[23:30.90]They're so fun.
[23:32.30]They're just so cute.
[23:39.92]A car's not even allowed to be over here.
[23:44.65]This is a long drive.
[24:09.34]I could be going so much faster.
[24:15.75]So this is just a rental.
[24:16.69]Alright, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[24:43.88]It's still like two miles.
[24:45.08]Is that 18 miles?
[24:46.47]No.
[24:51.63]I should play long drive again.
[24:52.73]Okay.
[25:07.98]Who's to say that I can't just drive over there?
[25:14.10]Is that a stupid idea?
[25:30.51]I can't drive on the grass.
[25:40.14]Look, I already shaved off like 0.4 miles already.
[25:59.14]Switch to sport mode.
[26:04.54]Ooh, good thinking.
[26:06.74]Look at that.
[26:21.31]I'm so glad I decided to do that.
[26:23.64]That just saved a ton of time.
[26:29.81]I should say that was an entire mile that I just shaved off to go over here.
[26:34.96]They're both right here and then I'll come back and deliver the other ones.
[26:40.90]Watch the carrots.
[26:41.54]Yeah, I can see him.
[26:47.69]What is this?
[26:50.71]Buy this?
[26:58.21]$30,000 to buy this house?
[26:59.89]You can have a farm?
[27:01.39]Um... Hello?
[27:08.37]What's going on here?
[27:12.04]What's wrong with the car?
[27:15.28]What's wrong with the car?
[27:18.90]Oh, I was in the passenger seat.
[27:28.17]I didn't know you could sit in the passenger seat.
[27:42.60]Alright, there's no street lights here.
[27:43.84]I can't see shit.
[27:53.02]Is the multiplayer actually fun?
[27:54.16]If I open this up to the public, is it going to destroy the whole game?
[27:59.61]If I have like a server or something, is that bad?
[28:05.59]It's not fun.
[28:10.31]Just send it.
[28:13.96]I don't know if I'm ready to just send it yet.
[28:15.98]I think... Oh wait, somebody's in trouble.
[28:21.48]I'm here.
[28:21.90]What do you need?
[28:24.00]You alright?
[28:40.61]Is this an abandoned van?
[28:41.67]Can I just put the produce in here?
[28:50.15]Oh, you have to tow it.
[28:52.69]Okay.
[28:56.69]It says I can just drive it.
[29:06.11]Can't start it.
[29:06.67]Start the engine.
[29:09.21]Come on.
[29:16.22]I can't use it.
[29:25.47]There's a lot of flavor town in here.
[29:27.03]Yeah there is.
[29:46.36]The road is so slick right now.
[29:47.70]Alright, this will get me... You are now driver level 2.
[29:55.58]You can now drive a taxi.
[29:56.94]There we go.
[29:57.50]I got so excited from the news!
[30:03.72]Alright, I think I have to turn the sound... I gotta turn the soundtrack off.
[30:20.14]This is a new little town.
[30:21.42]Alright, well, let's go into comfort mode.
[30:33.73]This game has a radio system.
[30:35.19]I don't know how DMCA friendly it is.
[30:39.91]Alright, let me turn this in.
[30:55.55]Okay, which one is the carrots?
[30:58.87]Alright, give me some money.
[31:02.87]The corn box.
[31:03.74]Alright, that's $2,300.
[31:06.32]Very nice.
[31:08.30]Drive the trophy.
[31:10.26]Find a trophy taxi and drive it.
[31:12.44]Hold on, I guess I got deliveries to do still.
[31:21.17]Where's the other delivery?
[31:32.22]Holy shit.
[31:32.98]This is like fucking Pangea.
[31:35.02]There's a whole continent.
[31:39.53]Where's the other delivery?
[31:43.41]Strap the cargo down.
[31:44.63]Oh, wait a minute.
[31:58.82]That would have been good to know.
[32:11.33]OK, so now.
[32:16.12]I put this down.
[32:21.56]Where's the other deliveries?
[32:23.72]They're not on the.
[32:24.38]Are they still on the map?
[32:25.94]Because one of them was right here.
[32:27.06]There we go.
[32:37.21]I mean, we're going to get DMCA, but I'll put it on the radio.
[32:43.26]Yeah, there's an internet radio.
[32:45.60]Should we do Trucker FM?
[32:47.24]What's on Trucker FM?
[32:55.39]I mean... The stream got destroyed.
[33:08.71]Is that enough to... Okay, is that enough to... Is that just kill the VOD?
[33:12.31]Is the VOD now just dead because of that five seconds that just played right there?
[33:20.16]It's alright, guys.
[33:20.68]We can go back to...
[33:41.58]Alright, it's over there.
[33:42.24]Am I going on gas?
[33:46.80]I think I got plenty of gas.
[33:57.55]No, that's the taxi.
[33:59.45]Oh shit, it's right there.
[34:00.77]Here you go.
[34:10.21]Was this two grand?
[34:15.19]Thank you.
[34:18.01]And then the last one is all the way back across town.
[34:21.07]I kind of don't care anymore.
[34:23.34]I want to do the taxi because it's part of the tutorial.
[34:25.74]So someone's going to get a bag, a box of free carrots on the side of the road.
[34:30.36]And let's put it in the back of the taxi.
[34:46.88]Can I just open the trunk?
[34:54.03]I can't put the carrots in here?
[34:55.03]Come on, I definitely can, right?
[35:20.91]I want to put it- I want to strap it to the back of the car.
[35:45.42]Okay, so how do I- can I not- strap cargo.
[35:48.50]Shit.
[35:51.74]No, I can't.
[35:52.60]Whatever.
[35:53.26]Free carrots on the side of the road.
[35:54.34]I don't care.
[35:57.24]Okay, pick up this person here and drive them to... And they want comfort.
[36:02.38]3800.
[36:02.42]Go to pickup location.
[36:05.44]It's right there.
[36:08.07]Got it.
[36:08.33]It's right next to me.
[36:19.51]Fuck the carrots.
[36:20.11]I don't care.
[36:42.22]That's not a good sign.
[36:43.60]That's not a good sign.
[36:44.48]Alright, is there enough time for you to cancel this ride?
[36:51.30]Do you open the app and say cancel the ride and just walk away?
[36:56.51]Do you pretend to not be the guy that was looking for a pickup?
[37:00.21]Just immediately shake your hair and make your hair look fucked up like a different person and put your shirt up over your mouth?
[37:06.61]Sir, you're a different guy.
[37:08.09]Cancel the ride and just pretend like you're a different guy.
[37:13.69]Alright, let's go.
[37:17.27]And you want to go across the whole entire game.
[37:20.01]3.6 miles and you want to be comfortable.
[37:21.59]You got it.
[38:07.42]How's the music?
[38:07.92]The music okay?
[38:11.17]Actually, this is my favorite band.
[38:12.35]This is called The Rockstars and Bobby Stevenson.
[38:16.79]A great band.
[38:17.35]One of my favorites.
[38:19.49]Yeah.
[38:20.21]Are you in town for the weekend?
[38:22.63]Yeah, that concert that's going on.
[38:24.63]That's right.
[38:24.99]There is a concert going on.
[38:26.09]I forgot about that.
[38:29.11]Yeah, I like to really have conversations with my passengers.
[38:31.68]I like to really be personal.
[38:34.80]No, I'm fine.
[38:35.48]Everything's fine.
[38:36.12]Everything's safe.
[38:37.64]Are you comfortable?
[38:38.22]Do you want a water?
[38:39.88]I got a bottle, two bottles of water in the side panel there.
[38:44.48]Yeah.
[38:46.54]Actually, give me your palm.
[38:47.78]I want to read your palm now, too.
[38:52.49]Yeah, let me see.
[38:54.99]Oh, it says your love life is not going so well, is it?
[38:58.79]Yeah, that's too bad.
[38:59.89]Do you have a girlfriend?
[39:03.11]Boyfriend?
[39:03.87]Anything like that?
[39:07.72]Yeah, hold on.
[39:09.72]You want to go to the beach?
[39:17.81]The guy does not care.
[39:18.89]Put it in sand mode.
[39:28.32]Oh man, that doesn't sound good.
[39:41.02]It's so much dust.
[39:44.18]Don't... Let's blow the windows up.
[39:45.41]Don't breathe this in.
[39:55.65]Really?
[40:08.89]Just stay in the car.
[40:09.73]It'll be fine.
[40:10.37]Don't worry.
[40:10.83]Damn, Grandma is strong.
[40:21.40]I think that should be good.
[40:25.32]Alright, we're dropping you off there.
[40:33.87]Okay, let's go.
[40:53.40]Let me just get back to the road.
[40:54.24]It's fine.
[40:57.75]It's because it started raining.
[41:05.79]I can't believe this person is still in the car.
[41:09.15]Just push him the whole way.
[41:10.51]Okay, would you get out?
[41:19.74]You would get out and help, right?
[41:42.71]Alright, we're back on the road.
[41:43.73]We're good.
[41:47.34]But it's so much faster that way.
[42:18.42]Is that correct?
[42:19.82]Where's the car right now?
[42:21.00]Yeah, this is way faster.
[42:36.24]His comfort is, he's doing fine.
[42:38.52]He's, I got two bars on comfort.
[42:46.58]Alright, if there were puke bags in back of the passenger and driver seat, would you be comfortable in this car?
[43:05.03]Are they empty?
[43:05.79]Yes, they both have never been used.
[43:11.58]If it didn't start raining, I'd be fine.
[43:18.02]I gotta get the momentum.
[43:19.12]OK.
[43:26.79]This is so bad for the car.
[43:29.31]Hey, the best part about this guy, this is a rental.
[43:32.13]I don't, this is not my car.
[43:35.19]This is struggling.
[43:40.77]Wait, 1.0 MPG?
[43:43.24]One mile per gallon?
[43:45.00]That's not correct, right?
[43:47.08]That's not correct.
[43:50.50]Oh shit.
[43:59.83]Oh.
[43:59.93]I'm telling you, this guy does not care.
[44:19.83]It's kind of funny because this actually did save probably like a full minute.
[44:45.03]So anyways, as I was saying...
[44:47.92]You know, the suit that's hauled this land used to be owned by an oil baron a long time ago.
[44:52.00]I just need to get back to the road.
[45:01.36]How's this guy not talked?
[45:15.86]I guess would you talk though?
[45:17.16]I would be like, uh, fuck.
[45:18.56]Do I say anything about this?
[45:21.52]Can I push him up the mountain?
[45:27.12]Under one MPG.
[45:33.69]Under one MPG is effectively, you could probably ride a riding lawnmower and get better gas mileage.
[45:43.02]In fact, the riding lawnmower is probably like four MPG.
[45:55.99]I think some RC cars nowadays get better gas mileage than that.
[46:06.57]I'm going to get the same amount of money.
[46:07.65]It does not matter.
[46:11.35]Hey, is he comfortable?
[46:14.07]I think so.
[46:16.95]Holy shit, Granny, you're strong.
[46:26.34]Alright, I think I can get it now.
[46:36.74]I made it back to the road.
[46:37.61]There it is.
[46:45.42]0.9 MPG.
[46:46.40]Will it improve immensely when I just start driving on the road?
[46:49.16]It's already went up.
[46:59.09]0.95 MPG.
[47:08.90]Let's go.
[47:13.72]change gears I think it's on auto isn't it one mile per gallon there we go 1.1 my top speed is increasing oh shit this is that a good that was a why is it telling me that that's a good thing
[47:44.56]Ah, we've been going too fast.
[47:50.04]What?
[47:50.70]What?
[47:52.56]Excuse me?
[47:53.16]Did you say be careful?
[47:59.79]Okay.
[48:00.81]That's, uh... Now he's pissed.
[48:04.91]Not after being pushed through the sand and going through the mud and flying off the cliff.
[48:09.59]He just doesn't want to go fast.
[48:12.53]I got to here in record time and your estimate was... 3.50 p.m.
[48:16.98]It's 3.15 and I'm pulling up.
[48:21.82]Sorry, it wasn't the most comfortable ride.
[48:23.36]I was just thinking about just ghost riding him into the fucking water.
[48:31.84]Nobody fucks a granny.
[48:44.30]Alright, speed limit's 45.
[48:45.10]Like, what if I go 46?
[48:47.02]Is he gonna freak out?
[48:47.86]I was going so fast.
[49:04.57]Dude, I gotta get a top speed.
[49:05.85]I gotta get a top speed.
[49:07.71]I gotta try to go 100.
[49:08.25]It said, you did it.
[49:09.73]Top speed.
[49:12.76]Well, nobody's in the car, though, and there's no other people around.
[49:14.84]I'll do it.
[49:23.88]What?
[49:26.48]What?
[49:28.77]You know what?
[49:29.37]Fuck you, man.
[49:32.09]Oh, you want to get there?
[49:38.21]I'll get you there in time.
[49:42.29]We got a complainer in the backseat.
[49:43.83]We got a complainer.
[49:47.85]By the way, thanks for getting out and pushing when I was in a ton of need.
[49:50.93]By the way, I'm 80.
[49:51.47]See how old I am?
[49:54.23]Yeah, oh man.
[49:55.15]No, no, I can't believe it.
[49:56.31]Get the fuck out of the car.
[50:03.12]Oh shit, hold on.
[50:04.14]I gotta save him.
[50:07.54]Wasn't that sick?
[50:22.44]This is rental.
[50:22.96]I don't care.
[50:25.48]Alright.
[50:25.86]Thank you so much.
[50:27.78]Really appreciate the time.
[50:29.06]And by the way, have fun with that festival that you're going to.
[50:33.57]You're very welcome.
[50:35.59]I made 3,000 gold from that.
[50:38.21]I can drive a bus now?
[50:38.93]Let's go.
[50:54.93]Wait, what?
[50:56.03]No, I want to drive the bus.
[50:58.39]Where do you need to go?
[51:01.13]No, no, no.
[51:02.07]No, fuck you.
[51:02.65]I don't even want this car anymore.
[51:04.23]You use it.
[51:04.65]You take it.
[51:05.09]I don't want it.
[51:09.02]Teleport to your house.
[51:10.60]Uh, no, I want the bus.
[51:17.74]What is this?
[51:22.42]Charging station?
[51:30.94]Can I go in?
[51:32.90]What?
[51:35.06]Are you serious?
[51:35.56]Wait.
[51:36.16]Hold on a second.
[51:44.88]I can get my... It's 300 to get my... What is it?
[51:47.56]A Tucson?
[51:54.65]I can spawn it here.
[52:12.72]Can I get a snack?
[52:18.13]How you doing?
[52:18.61]Yep.
[52:18.89]Could I get a... Hold on.
[52:20.51]You guys changed the fucking menu all the goddamn time.
[52:24.56]I'll take a... Can't really see.
[52:28.79]I'll take a number three with onions.
[52:32.20]And I want those grilled onions.
[52:33.60]You didn't do grilled onions last time I was here.
[52:35.64]I want ketchup and mustard on it.
[52:38.20]I want extra pickles.
[52:40.80]Okay.
[52:42.14]I'll be ready for it whenever you're ready.
[52:43.46]Do you have a bathroom here?
[52:52.95]I can use the bathroom.
[53:04.49]I'm going to Austin Powers this if I'm not careful, honestly.
[53:06.67]Alright.
[53:14.95]See you later.
[53:19.69]Old people and then a handshake emote.
[53:21.64]Grilled onions.
[53:22.44]I actually can go.
[53:37.42]no oh I'm gonna do a burger delivery let's go
[54:12.93]How far is it?
[54:18.47]That's way too far.
[54:30.58]I can't commit to that.
[54:31.76]I just spent 300 bucks to get this spawned.
[54:34.20]We're trying to unlock.
[54:39.52]Wait, there's probably a timer on this delivery.
[54:44.75]What the fuck?
[54:48.36]Can I take this tire?
[55:01.87]Wait.
[55:02.89]Can I get in your car?
[55:09.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[55:10.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[55:10.93]Don't go anywhere.
[55:11.75]Wait.
[55:12.07]Stay right there.
[55:17.79]Alright, I need you to go straight and then to the right.
[55:27.62]And we have to be there in less than 20 minutes.
[55:30.04]Otherwise I'm gonna get a bad rating.
[55:38.23]It's because of this dickhead.
[55:44.66]This person here, this asshole...
[55:53.66]Dude, why can't I... How am I supposed to deliver this?
[55:55.76]No, honestly, how do you put this in the car?
[56:07.69]Do I actually have to run?
[56:08.95]On the roof.
[56:16.49]I'm telling you, if an Uber Eats driver shows up with...
[56:22.53]the bag of my food on the roof of their car, I am not going to accept it.
[56:32.34]If I'm very, if I'm, okay, if I'm really careful, I should be fine.
[56:40.54]Hey, I hope it wasn't a soup.
[56:45.08]Where is the, where even is the delivery?
[56:47.06]Deliver the blue bar or the yellow bar?
[56:50.45]It's a blue one, right?
[56:57.73]Is it yellow?
[57:05.62]No, it's blue.
[57:06.32]Yeah, right?
[57:10.37]Is it yellow?
[57:12.19]I don't think it's yellow.
[57:13.05]Oh, that's a passenger waiting to be picked up.
[57:17.49]It's definitely blue.
[57:18.79]Yeah, it's that one.
[57:19.41]Alright, let's go.
[57:26.76]As long as I just keep this right here, I'll be fine.
[57:37.00]Blue is for the bus?
[57:39.46]Where the hell's the delivery?
[57:51.37]Because that's a passenger.
[57:54.63]Your exhaust is fucked up.
[57:58.08]I think it is over here.
[57:59.30]Maybe I'm crazy.
[58:00.02]Maybe I don't know.
[58:01.23]The delivery already failed.
[58:02.85]The timer ran out.
[58:05.89]It's got, well, I'm just going to go there anyways.
[58:14.14]We're good.
[58:15.12]We're good.
[58:15.54]We're good.
[58:15.86]Everything's fine.
[58:17.34]And it's raining too.
[58:18.56]That's not good.
[58:20.52]Oh, that's awful.
[58:38.49]If the GPS would just stop correcting every five seconds.
[58:56.52]It's been ran over.
[58:57.72]Alright, it's been ran over.
[58:59.42]It's been ran over a few times.
[59:01.82]Uh, hold on.
[59:02.40]Oh, fuck it.
[59:05.12]I'm just gonna run it.
[59:24.07]Is this the right way?
[59:36.27]This is the intro to an early 2000s comedy movie.
[59:41.81]I gotta get it there before it's the time is up.
[59:47.88]This would be the early 2000s comedy movie intro to a 2025
[59:55.48]like life right like if uber eats and delivery and shit was back then I guess they would delivery drivers but not necessarily the individual like uber eats driver alright is this it no it's over here that's the yeah we're going there after oh fuck come on I can't make that
[60:28.83]I got to get there before 4.55.
[60:33.40]Alright.
[60:33.82]Thank you for choosing a big burger.
[60:42.80]Just hold on.
[60:44.14]Don't open that bag until I leave because there's a special surprise in there.
[60:56.89]Alright, well, the next tutorial is drive a minibus.
[61:07.73]You have to rent the moped in front of the delivery store.
[61:10.31]Ah, OK.
[61:12.68]Alright, so this is it, right?
[61:19.62]Yeah, I feel like this would be kind of fun like in multiplayer.
[61:24.21]Alright, let's... The first stop is... I'm coming up on an hour here.
[61:27.33]I'm coming up on a break.
[61:28.79]I'll come back to this.
[61:31.29]That's way too many stops.
[61:32.97]I'll do these two.
[61:33.67]Okay.
[61:39.11]Transport five bus passengers.
[61:41.13]Oh, God.
[61:41.61]Okay.
[61:50.59]Alright, let me... I'm going to come back to this.
[61:59.17]Get in.
[62:02.65]Okay.
[62:02.95]Oh, that was freaking me out.
[62:04.86]Alright.
[62:05.20]I'll be right back.
[62:06.84]Back in about four minutes.
[62:09.52]Get up and stretch.
[62:10.48]Move around.
[62:10.96]This game is very fun.
[62:14.10]And I'm enjoying it.
[62:14.70]And we're going to play at least for like another hour or two.
[62:17.10]And then we'll play Chrono Trigger.
[62:19.59]Chrono Trigger is going to be more of a chill out late night game tonight.
[62:22.33]So I'll be right back.
[62:26.67]See you guys in a few minutes.
[63:17.63]Thank you.
[66:01.72]Hello, hello, how are you?
[66:07.49]I've got my water.
[66:09.45]And... I put a little bit of strawberry lemonade in that water.
[66:14.95]Just a little.
[66:15.87]To give it some flavor.
[66:20.00]Let's go.
[66:20.32]Alright, what was I doing?
[66:25.52]Alright, I... Should I just... Okay.
[66:28.98]Ah, fuck, I didn't set that thing up.
[66:32.25]What should I do about the radio?
[66:33.41]Should I just turn it off?
[66:51.17]I could do like video game soundtracks probably.
[66:54.43]What's a good video game soundtrack to throw on?
[67:01.99]I mean, I don't mind this, but this is the, you know, the probably 15th time we've heard this particular song.
[67:10.71]To put Binding of Isaac on, play this song.
[67:12.99]What's this one?
[67:13.51]Okay.
[67:29.57]This is Happy Rock
[67:37.11]I have for all time sake, I'm going to leave this on.
[67:44.93]What the fuck?
[67:46.11]Oh, it's too many sounds.
[68:05.39]The Everhood soundtrack.
[68:06.31]Ooh, that might be good.
[68:07.13]Alright, I'm going.
[68:17.60]Shit, hold on.
[68:22.48]Turn it up.
[68:23.92]It's a good volume.
[68:24.54]Alright, there's apparently a passenger here.
[68:31.48]Yeah, apparently Poke had a server for this.
[68:33.52]If I can figure out how it works, I would just turn it on.
[68:36.10]That'd be fun.
[68:36.50]Wait, is this the wrong bus?
[68:38.58]I need five passengers.
[68:51.03]Oh, shit.
[68:51.35]I got five people in here?
[68:54.66]One, two, three.
[68:55.56]Alright, we got them all.
[68:57.80]Somebody close the door.
[69:00.14]Welcome to hell, motherfuckers.
[69:02.78]This is their bus ride to hell.
[69:18.11]Wait, too early.
[69:19.41]Hold on, I could actually be there in time.
[69:26.41]Why is the GPS changing?
[69:40.90]It's recalculating.
[69:41.98]Alright.
[69:42.98]Well, I don't want to get the two early, but I don't want to get the two late either.
[69:53.95]Move.
[69:54.75]I got five people here.
[70:00.88]That wasn't that bad.
[70:07.48]I just clipped a little bit.
[70:16.15]It's on comfort mode.
[70:21.98]Why is it doing that?
[70:31.12]Two minutes, 25 seconds.
[70:32.04]I'm already getting off of the junkyard?
[70:48.43]I'm still apparently too early.
[70:49.66]Dude, you can't... You cannot go 20 in a 45...
[71:02.16]Dude, what are you?
[71:03.86]You can't go 40, then 20, then 40, then 20, then 40.
[71:06.84]It's 45.
[71:07.96]What are you doing?
[71:14.32]Okay.
[71:18.85]Everybody flip this guy off.
[71:26.95]By the way, did I tell you that we've got the best flapjacks in Cincinnati?
[71:31.89]I had to turn around and tell you.
[71:33.83]In fact, I had to turn around and take you the other way because we passed it about a half mile back this way.
[71:38.67]I had to show it to you.
[71:49.10]Don't pass me.
[71:49.96]Alright.
[71:53.41]How far away is this?
[71:57.71]I'm not going to get there in one minute.
[72:00.31]How am I going to get there in one minute?
[72:14.25]Hey, we might not get you there in one piece, but we'll get you there.
[72:17.51]2.1 miles away?
[72:28.96]Wait, what?
[72:31.22]Why did it make me go this way?
[72:36.57]Why did it make me go all the way down here?
[72:41.70]I went the wrong way.
[72:42.54]Why is the GPS saying go that way?
[72:59.49]Uh, no, I'm on time.
[73:05.66]I'm right on time, apparently.
[73:20.09]It happens when you cross lanes.
[73:39.03]To be on time is to be late.
[73:43.34]I mean, I'm going to get here.
[73:44.80]It was only two stops.
[74:21.85]too fast the car can't handle it what stop is there wait I have to stop the car or there's a stop coming up
[74:59.60]Okay, here we go.
[75:00.58]This is the first stop.
[75:01.45]I'm on time.
[75:10.85]Alright, everybody good?
[75:11.59]How do I open the door?
[75:19.79]Alright, you can all get out.
[75:29.36]Thank you very much.
[75:31.16]Nice.
[75:32.06]Thank you.
[75:33.96]Level up.
[75:34.50]I didn't get anything.
[75:35.66]What did I get?
[75:36.02]$15,000.
[75:40.78]Holy shit.
[75:41.58]$8,500.
[75:41.60]Level up to driver level five.
[75:43.04]Okay.
[75:58.92]Let's get a good OST on here.
[76:01.60]This game is really fun.
[76:02.74]It's just kind of... I like it a lot.
[76:04.91]It's chill.
[76:14.77]Put on Everhood.
[76:16.01]Put the Everhood OST on.
[76:18.17]It's a good one.
[76:18.71]I gotta play Everhood too.
[76:21.49]I've heard some mixed things about it.
[76:22.79]I've heard that it's... People like the music, but don't really like anything else.
[76:27.24]I've heard very mixed things about it.
[76:44.24]Okay, let's see.
[76:47.84]Original soundtrack.
[76:48.74]There it is.
[76:49.10]Is it going?
[77:01.83]Oh, there it is.
[77:05.90]Let's get it in a good volume.
[77:06.86]Nothing too crazy.
[77:19.12]Just something in the background.
[77:21.16]I'm going to turn the sound of the game down a little.
[77:29.87]Because that... It's kind of a lot.
[77:41.64]Okay, that's good.
[77:42.26]Alright, so now I got to get to level five.
[78:02.74]I definitely want to play it though.
[78:03.74]It seems fun.
[78:06.00]I heard it's just a very different game than the first one.
[78:09.14]Which that's fine.
[78:09.88]That doesn't bother me.
[78:16.51]I want to see what this is.
[78:17.43]What's this blue over here?
[78:32.54]Did you hear about Saw 11?
[78:40.19]You should not go over 40 times... Wait, what?
[78:42.59]What's going on?
[78:45.13]This is a race.
[78:45.79]You have to do it with a specific car?
[78:50.60]Okay.
[79:09.35]Oh my God, that sound is going to drive me crazy.
[79:18.92]I try it with this one.
[79:28.92]It's probably the worst car to do this with.
[79:46.07]Are you playing on an iPad?
[79:47.43]No, the middle of the screen, I get it.
[79:49.93]It looks kind of like I could be on an iPad.
[79:51.84]I'm not.
[79:58.46]I think that's just the kind of centering of the center mass of the car.
[80:03.27]I want a motorcycle for this.
[80:29.53]Have to start raining.
[80:35.42]This is a good one.
[80:46.53]It's like the inertia.
[80:47.51]How do you feel about iPad games lately?
[80:52.13]Nah, I'm not a fan anymore.
[80:57.41]Sometimes stuff comes out that's great, but... How much penalty did I just lose?
[81:08.77]iPad games nowadays, they come out and it's just like... A lot of them are just junk.
[81:15.86]It's like a hidden object and you collect this and collect that and buy this and buy that.
[81:22.86]I don't know.
[81:24.30]I don't really mess with them anymore.
[81:31.82]Some of them can be really fun, but... Alright, I just did it.
[81:36.28]What'd I get?
[81:36.64]Not quite after this turn.
[81:42.14]Alright, punch it.
[81:56.06]That was sick.
[81:56.57]I don't even care about the penalty.
[82:00.70]Alright, my final time is 59 seconds.
[82:06.73]That was one lap?
[82:09.75]What am I on time for?
[82:10.75]There's nobody in the car, right?
[82:13.09]Alright, how do I get to my house?
[82:22.79]Where even is my house?
[82:36.11]Select button on the controller.
[82:39.43]Oh, hold on.
[82:40.65]Respawn.
[82:41.89]No, no, no, no.
[82:45.54]Quest.
[82:47.60]Gotta get to level five.
[82:52.40]No, no event town.
[82:53.80]Because this is the map.
[83:06.30]Focus on player, select... Unless it's like something on a controller.
[83:09.60]I don't know.
[83:13.38]It told me it before and I just don't remember it.
[83:15.52]It said to open this and then... High priority deliveries.
[83:23.04]Maybe it is just respawn.
[83:30.81]Only select home on the legend.
[83:35.86]Ah, OK.
[83:36.82]Where the hell is my home?
[83:37.61]100 bucks?
[83:41.97]Sure, why not?
[83:45.69]OK.
[83:48.41]I'll back at my house.
[83:49.27]Can I do anything in my house?
[83:58.07]This is a level one Sims house.
[83:59.65]Alright, sleep.
[84:09.54]Wake up.
[84:11.93]Manage the building.
[84:12.81]Destruction.
[84:13.77]No, don't destroy it.
[84:14.53]Alright, what am I?
[84:21.73]I gotta get to level 5.
[84:22.57]I'm level 3.
[84:27.88]I wanna do... I wanna do... I wanna do garbage.
[84:37.70]Can I do a garbage mission?
[84:43.88]Think of a fast food restaurant that starts with W besides Whataburger.
[84:46.38]Wendy's.
[84:47.04]I win.
[84:47.34]What do I win?
[84:47.74]Alright, where's the garbage job?
[84:52.83]I don't see a garbage job.
[85:00.75]Ambulance?
[85:03.82]No.
[85:04.60]Taxi?
[85:06.00]Oh, this is like fucked up now.
[85:16.94]Can I do this yet?
[85:37.19]Get a garbage truck at the truck dealership, but you need more trucking experience, okay?
[86:15.55]So how hard is it to open?
[86:16.89]Oh, nice.
[86:17.27]There we go.
[86:17.55]There's my car.
[86:22.25]How hard is it to open this up to have like a server?
[86:25.01]Is there anything I have to worry about with that?
[86:26.73]Or can I just like do like open it to the public?
[86:36.32]Because I feel like this would be actually really funny with like 10, 20 people just running around.
[86:48.66]Poconos.
[86:49.22]Maybe I'll ask him about it.
[86:50.06]It would be a nightmare.
[86:56.26]Can I get on the bike?
[86:58.10]Come on, let me get on the bike.
[86:59.94]Please.
[87:02.71]Please.
[87:07.13]Come on.
[87:14.89]Damn it.
[87:15.25]I need to be level 20 driving.
[87:17.47]I'm level 3.
[87:37.03]Where's my taxi cab?
[87:42.25]That just hurt my head looking at that.
[87:57.60]There's a dude you just grab and hold on.
[88:03.71]Oh shit, what am I doing to this guy?
[88:14.14]Alright, I need to do a job.
[88:15.78]I have a ton of money.
[88:16.74]Alright, now I'm pumped up.
[88:19.57]Let's go.
[88:39.28]Try the blue police car.
[88:44.98]This music is weird.
[88:46.46]It really weirdly fits this.
[88:56.59]Shit.
[88:58.37]I can't drive any of these.
[88:59.33]I need to be level five.
[89:06.60]Alright, let me get to level five.
[89:15.19]I need a car.
[89:15.97]I need a car.
[89:17.01]I need a car.
[89:17.51]I need a car.
[89:21.39]Let's do a couple of taxi missions.
[89:22.53]I'll get it in a second.
[89:24.13]Alright.
[89:24.41]This one is 4,600 comfort.
[89:26.41]You got it.
[89:27.03]Let's pick them up.
[89:43.79]I'm going to try to actually take this really seriously, too.
[89:45.59]I'll try to be very, very good.
[89:46.89]Alright, let's go.
[89:52.23]4600, we're going pretty far.
[89:53.25]Let's go.
[89:54.37]It's going to be a comfortable ride.
[89:55.82]And we're also going to pick up this trash.
[90:11.58]This is not the music you have when it comes... Wait, can I do two passengers?
[90:18.83]No, no, just go.
[90:29.93]It's like truck simulator, but with a social element.
[90:33.00]I bet you this on a server with 20 people would be really fun.
[90:37.30]People doing different jobs, people being taxi drivers.
[90:40.04]That'd be fun.
[90:43.96]I definitely want to try it at some point.
[90:55.83]Isn't that just GTA?
[90:56.55]Yeah, it'd be GTA, but not GTA.
[91:04.19]This is in Roblox.
[91:05.56]I need to play Roblox again.
[91:13.52]Ster and I are going to do the Dark Souls 3 co-op mod this weekend, I think.
[91:19.54]There's going to be some crazy shit this weekend.
[91:23.08]But besides that, there's a couple things I want to do around that.
[91:38.43]This song goes pretty hard.
[91:40.29]Damn.
[91:49.54]Alright, that was safe.
[91:50.34]We're good.
[91:50.68]Okay, I'm almost... Wait, did I lose driver points?
[91:59.19]Why am I level two?
[92:02.32]Why do I have two experience level now?
[92:19.52]Oh, it's car dependent.
[92:20.70]Okay.
[92:26.57]Slow down.
[92:27.05]I'm going too fast.
[92:27.79]Wait, it's 70.
[92:28.13]Okay.
[92:57.88]Don't go over 70 and I'm fine.
[93:01.63]Level four.
[93:02.25]Okay, I went over it for one second and I freaked out.
[93:22.56]I definitely want to try to go get a faster car and try to go as fast as I can.
[93:29.59]What?
[93:31.75]It started raining, so you're going to blame me for that.
[93:34.96]It starts raining and you get mad at me.
[93:38.86]Is he not comfortable in the rain?
[93:55.41]Into autopilot.
[93:59.04]Okay, autopilot is on and that didn't do anything.
[94:04.98]That's not my fault.
[94:06.66]I turned on autopilot and it didn't do anything.
[94:12.59]Alright, well now comfort doesn't matter.
[94:14.13]Let's just go.
[94:23.94]Oh, auto.
[94:24.32]Auto.
[94:31.64]There are blinkers in the game.
[94:32.94]I didn't even realize that.
[94:43.65]They don't even take that much money off anyways.
[94:45.17]It's fine.
[94:45.49]You're the worst driver I've ever seen consistently.
[94:59.83]In a video game, maybe.
[95:09.72]2.2 miles per gallon.
[95:10.44]That's good, yeah.
[95:16.96]There's like Mario Kart oil slick all over the ground.
[95:33.30]Is the car smoking, by the way?
[95:35.32]Or is that just the rain?
[96:01.71]I did not even do that.
[96:02.51]I'll probably be level 5 after this, I would imagine, right?
[96:37.87]Two broken down cars, too.
[96:39.01]If you had to be a driver for a living, like a taxi or a garbage truck or something, would... You're asking would I do that?
[96:49.23]Um... In real life, I drive... I like driving.
[96:53.29]It's fine.
[96:54.55]But I don't want to drive a big car.
[96:57.94]Huge cars?
[96:58.64]No, no way.
[97:00.42]Give me something small.
[97:04.48]But if I'm in a little car, I'll be fine.
[97:17.34]Nice.
[97:19.14]Okay.
[97:19.44]3,000.
[97:19.46]Did I get to level five?
[97:22.28]Okay.
[97:24.36]I'm level four.
[97:25.28]Almost there.
[97:25.68]Can I take a delivery?
[97:33.04]I need a truck.
[97:36.30]Can I spawn a truck?
[97:59.86]Can I take anything out of the fridge?
[98:04.16]Oh, also, probably going to be doing another Ichio horror game night.
[98:16.20]I don't really want this.
[98:19.51]Probably like it next week at some point.
[98:21.57]I'll get a few more of them.
[98:22.73]There's a couple I want to play again, too.
[98:28.12]Scare Thursdays is back.
[98:30.70]Be more like Scare Whenever Day.
[98:36.63]But yeah, I do want to do that again.
[98:38.45]It's fun.
[98:47.50]I got to get to at least level four.
[98:50.20]We'll take another passenger.
[98:51.00]I'm just going to go for it.
[98:55.70]It's the most expensive one.
[98:58.01]$25,000.
[98:58.27]What does it not?
[99:01.28]Oh, who cares?
[99:02.10]It's a limo.
[99:03.42]I need a limo.
[99:07.48]Shit.
[99:07.78]How do I get a limo?
[99:09.03]I can do this one.
[99:09.69]20 grand to drive you across the whole world.
[99:13.25]Alright.
[99:15.97]Where are you?
[99:16.35]Where's the pickup location?
[99:30.93]Why would somebody do this?
[99:31.90]I don't know.
[99:32.72]I feel like the car is floating.
[99:39.96]Alright, this one's going to be a huge one.
[100:04.61]You have to press the button twice for autopilot?
[100:09.73]Oh, God damn it.
[100:10.67]Okay.
[100:13.46]Well, yeah, it works now.
[100:14.46]You ever have Jollibee before?
[100:18.40]I had it once.
[100:19.80]And I remember walking into Jollibee and saying, this place is, this place is crazy.
[100:24.92]This place is very weird.
[100:26.08]There's fried chicken and spaghetti.
[100:28.36]And I was like, this is, I don't know about this place.
[100:31.20]And then I had it and I was like, holy shit, that's very good.
[100:39.26]It's good, yeah.
[100:48.21]I have not had it in a very, very long time, so I can't say that I really remember it that fondly.
[100:54.30]I really don't.
[100:57.92]I thought it was good, though.
[100:58.70]I did like it.
[101:07.22]person is far away and by the way I'm just punching it on the highway we're gonna try to go 200 miles per hour I want the person in the back seat to have their mouth be open and they're like a cartoon their lips are flapping like there's a like a leaf blower blowing into their face
[101:38.22]Slow down, uncle.
[101:44.07]Slow down, uncle.
[101:47.37]See, when I re-chat, that's the problem.
[102:03.41]This is a good song to have right now.
[102:05.08]It's a good background sound.
[102:18.73]Hold on a second.
[102:19.65]Look at that.
[102:20.15]That is begging somebody to do this.
[102:49.67]Alright, let's go.
[102:50.13]Did I just get charged for that?
[103:14.98]Did I get charged for that?
[103:17.22]Did I just get charged for that?
[103:19.14]No.
[103:19.50]Oh, I can... Motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle.
[103:22.22]6,000 for the motorcycle?
[103:29.07]Yep.
[103:30.61]I want it.
[103:32.61]What the fuck?
[103:33.41]I have to be level 20.
[103:33.99]Rent?
[103:34.25]It's 10 bucks for 10 minutes?
[103:51.45]What is this rental?
[103:53.01]Ten.
[103:53.41]Five.
[103:56.99]Shit.
[103:58.21]What the fuck?
[104:03.57]No, I think I have to keep the taxi cab.
[104:19.40]What is this?
[104:23.29]Just buy gems?
[104:26.65]What is this?
[104:27.61]Sell vehicle.
[104:28.43]I can sell it?
[104:29.11]I don't even own it.
[104:30.43]No, I'm gonna make 20 grand.
[104:35.45]And I'll get to level 5 from this.
[104:48.72]Uh, what?
[104:49.20]Wait.
[104:49.78]Where's this pickup?
[104:54.67]Okay, up there.
[105:00.37]What's my dream car?
[105:04.21]Honestly, I don't really care that much.
[105:10.23]I definitely don't want a sports car.
[105:12.17]I think a sports car just doesn't really fit with me.
[105:26.28]I think like a dream car would be... I get inside of it and I've got a backup camera.
[105:32.11]I've got left camera.
[105:33.89]I got right camera.
[105:34.61]I got a top camera.
[105:36.47]I get... I don't have to fill it up that much.
[105:39.32]It's a really good MPG.
[105:41.50]It's...
[105:54.96]I don't know.
[105:55.22]It's like a BMW, a meme answer.
[105:58.42]Like a really nice BMW.
[106:00.27]Is that a meme answer?
[106:01.31]Is that a shit answer?
[106:02.03]Or like an Audi?
[106:06.75]Like a really, really top of the line Audi?
[106:09.97]Like the best one you could get.
[106:11.46]An Audi.
[106:12.68]Is that a meme answer?
[106:13.44]I think an Audi's a nice car.
[106:27.66]That's a millionaire answer?
[106:30.68]You can't ask somebody what their dream car is and be like, what do you mean dream car?
[106:34.18]Anything you want.

[106:36.94]Yeah, anything.
[106:37.86]All the bells and whistles.
[106:38.68]Doesn't matter.
[106:39.32]It could be the most expensive thing.
[106:40.42]What do you want?
[106:41.86]I guess it'd be an Audi.
[106:43.59]Millionaire.
[106:45.59]No, you asked me.

[112:04.96]Are the police actually after me?
[112:09.81]Are they gonna get me?
[112:12.49]Does every sentence end in a question?
[112:17.67]My tires are smoking?
[112:22.39]I'm driving a taxi?
[112:23.43]John Jacob Engelheimership.
[112:35.76]His name is my name too.
[112:38.52]Son, sing along!
[112:40.29]Whenever I go out, the people always shout, there goes, come on, John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, you to the chorus, his name is my name too.
[113:10.50]That's your best bit.
[113:13.49]No, it is not.
[113:15.03]Is it?
[113:15.81]No.
[113:17.31]Singing John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt is not a good bit.
[113:21.71]It's just a... It's an exclamation.
[113:26.28]I like it though.
[113:26.82]Alright, that's our destination.
[113:40.11]I like it.
[113:40.53]I think it's fun.
[113:42.25]It's fun just to sing.
[113:43.11]Let's try to get 100 miles per hour.
[113:45.97]Here we go.
[114:04.44]Come on.
[114:07.50]Come on, punch it.
[114:12.88]I'm in fifth gear.
[114:14.90]No one's ever been in fifth gear before.
[114:16.08]Holy shit.
[114:25.57]We're going to be going into sixth gear.
[114:26.89]I think the car is stalling.
[114:39.04]Wait, is the car fucked up?
[114:52.51]The car is cooked right now.
[114:53.95]The car is cooked.
[115:02.08]It kind of is.
[115:03.06]Dude, imagine holding your foot down, pushing the pedal all the way to the bottom and holding it there like this.
[115:13.27]That would be fucking horrible.
[115:25.66]The check engine light is on.
[115:27.90]Oh, that's okay.
[115:29.06]You're right.
[115:29.36]It is.
[115:33.03]I can't slow down.
[115:36.27]Oh, we're going up.
[115:37.11]We're going up and over.
[115:55.29]That's just a movie trailer for a horror game, a horror movie.
[116:13.21]It starts off with... John Jacob in the limousine.
[116:24.22]Legends say he died two years ago.
[116:27.60]His name is my name too.
[116:31.44]From visionary director Jeremy Elbertson.
[116:37.67]The movie is eight minutes long.
[116:44.75]And it still charges full price.
[116:48.91]Critics are saying it's the scariest movie of the year.
[116:54.22]Whenever I go out, people always shout.
[116:58.50]Here comes John!
[116:59.58]John up here on screen.
[117:00.40]Jingle!
[117:02.30]John on the screen.
[117:03.98]Jacob on the screen.
[117:05.84]Jingle!
[117:06.36]Wait, John, Jacob, Jingle, Heimer, Schmidt.
[117:09.32]All on the screen.
[117:11.54]And individual words hitting the camera.
[117:16.12]And then it goes dot, dot, dot.
[117:17.88]The name of the movie is... His name is my name too.
[117:22.83]Reddit X!
[117:40.41]No, no, no.
[117:40.79]It should be his name.
[117:48.24]X is for porn?
[117:49.24]No, no, no.
[117:51.77]It's rated R.
[118:00.24]jingle hymer no no if it was called jingle hymer it would be a serious drama movie it wouldn't be a horror movie it'd be like a biopic of somebody it would be taken very seriously it would be running for the oscars they'd have a bunch of a-listers trying to get oscars
[118:40.61]I don't even know why it's that song that I'm a glue to.
[118:43.82]I don't know why.
[118:44.26]I don't get it.
[118:45.78]Why that one?
[119:24.40]Can't push him up.
[119:40.11]I hate it.
[119:40.72]I just want to go up so bad.
[119:42.02]Ah, do you know what I mean?
[119:47.38]Like it's right there.
[119:48.58]It's right there.
[119:55.83]We mend the world through us.
[120:13.69]You need an Audi for that?
[120:14.75]Yeah.
[120:24.13]He said, oh boy.
[120:27.63]Please play Everhood 2.
[120:29.19]I will, I will, I will.
[120:30.13]There's a lot to do.
[120:32.53]I got a long list of things to play.
[120:34.71]And games to play.
[120:36.93]And things to do.
[120:38.37]And fun things to do.
[120:39.85]And not fun things to do.
[120:44.23]This is still so far away.
[120:54.83]What about Death Stranding?
[120:55.89]Now that's something I don't think I want to do.
[121:01.11]I feel like Death Stranding would be a game that I would actually lose my mind over.
[121:08.36]Don't promise stuff new viewers will think you're actually going to play them.
[121:11.56]Well, they're going to have to learn just like everybody else did.
[121:36.04]Do you regret your choice to be old?
[121:39.10]Time goes in one direction.
[121:42.56]It is not a choice for it to move that way.
[121:45.03]It just moves that way.
[121:53.39]Hold on, this is a good spot.
[121:56.10]Why are we stopping?
[121:59.08]We're stopping here for just a few minutes.
[122:00.68]I'm going to take an ad break.
[122:03.10]What's an ad break?
[122:04.54]We're going to stop right here.

[122:08.20]Alright, guys.

[127:38.47]Yeah, some people heard the steam sound effect because I was over here.
[127:44.39]I just got the deck builder game.
[127:48.93]Alright, let's finish this one up and then I'll be level five.
[127:59.58]And then we'll go from there.
[128:06.59]Oh, right.
[128:06.97]Okay, my car is over there.
[128:13.91]Rip Chrono Trigger.
[128:14.93]That's not true.
[128:18.30]It's only been live.
[128:19.84]It's only been live.
[128:20.90]Oh, we're still drifting.
[128:24.28]I've only been live for like two hours.
[128:25.27]Okay, finish this up.
[128:38.39]A lot of people in Severance, I haven't seen that show.
[128:42.95]And if that's a spoiler, you're in big trouble.
[128:57.30]Yeah, Chrono Trigger is going to be for the later night.
[129:01.78]Grab some hot cocoa, get a tea, glass of wine or something, and just chill.
[129:10.59]That's the late night portion of the stream.
[129:13.77]That's the after hours portion of the stream.
[129:16.86]But right now, playing this, I'm gonna play the deck game.
[129:21.40]And I'm good.
[129:24.86]Severance is a really good show.
[129:26.32]I know, Severance is like the Game of Thrones right now.
[129:29.73]Every single person's gonna watch it.
[129:31.37]People are gonna name their babies after characters.
[129:33.15]People are gonna get tattoos.
[129:35.55]I have to see it.
[129:36.35]I know.
[129:36.69]It's one of those cultural phenomenons.
[129:38.31]I understand.
[129:42.97]Where the fuck does this guy want to go, by the way?
[129:44.74]Were you taking me to like a campsite?
[129:47.28]In a taxi?
[129:49.58]Who calls a taxi and says, yeah, you're going to be off road, by the way.
[129:52.74]This is a taxi cab.
[130:01.43]It's only two seasons.
[130:04.51]OK, but is it two seasons of 60 minute long episodes?
[130:09.06]Because I consider that to be four seasons.
[130:22.40]This guy's going to work?
[130:27.26]He took me the most hazardous way possible.
[130:32.83]I would have been happier flying this guy over here in a helicopter.
[130:45.11]I like the way you turn mocking comments into wholesome moments.
[130:53.71]That's good.
[131:00.04]Don't ever go to Colorado.
[131:01.68]I want to go to Colorado.
[131:06.22]It seems like a fun place to visit.
[131:07.42]Never been.
[131:14.80]Something is struggling up here.
[131:23.93]You gonna ski or board?
[131:24.97]Nah, just be the asshole in the turtleneck that sits in the lodge and laughs at people.
[131:35.92]No, skiing?
[131:36.98]No, no, give me the thick turtleneck and a large coffee.
[131:46.55]And there's a really... I rent these.
[131:49.01]I don't own these.
[131:49.83]I rent some of the most expensive skis in the world.
[131:53.72]I rent them for an hour.
[131:55.80]And I sit them behind me.
[131:59.04]So people go, whoa, man, who's that?
[132:01.26]Damn, okay.
[132:12.55]And then I would say, yep, gonna hit the slopes.
[132:16.77]Something wrong with the car.
[132:19.10]That's a gonna hit the slopes and I would walk out.
[132:21.62]I would turn right around the lodge.
[132:24.40]And then somebody wearing the exact same clothes as me.
[132:27.65]Puts the skis on.
[132:29.57]And puts a, you know, a face, a ski mask and a hat and goggles.
[132:35.05]And then they go up and do the hard mountain and they do the crazy shit.
[132:39.37]And then they come down and then I come back around and they go home and I go in the lodge.
[132:44.33]Everyone's clapping and I'm like, there he is.
[132:47.16]The master of the slopes.
[132:56.61]I'm right down the street here.
[133:15.89]And then if anybody wants to interview me.
[133:24.17]Like, oh, we actually want to follow you around while you ski and talk to you about it.
[133:28.29]I'd be like, I need a lot of concentration when I do this.
[133:32.81]So I can only be interviewed in this lodge.
[133:47.02]Your ego has no limit.
[133:52.92]That'd be kind of fun.
[134:04.92]Yeah, I know I would end up being the character in every single video game and movie where if there's, oh my god, there's been a murder at the lodge.
[134:12.91]I'm, it's always, I'm the prime suspect, but it's never that guy.
[134:17.71]Ever.
[134:27.30]I know that's the character I'm telling you that I'm playing here, but I just want to drink coffee and...
[134:34.32]What is this fucking course?
[134:45.90]I guess this is for $20,000.
[134:47.04]That's a lot.
[134:53.06]Yeah, suspicious Nancy Drew character.
[134:54.86]That's right.
[135:08.23]Dude, you know what?
[135:10.95]I'm fucking done with this guy.
[135:13.03]Why would you call a taxi to go here?
[135:22.28]It's raining, it's dark, and we have to go to the top of the mountain?
[135:50.30]I don't think I can even get up here.
[135:53.34]Can I cut across?
[135:58.34]I think the bumps are in the way.
[136:00.01]Maybe I can go around here.
[136:01.39]Ooh, good one.
[136:16.79]And now push it around.
[136:21.19]No fuck.
[136:28.20]I'm in the passenger seat.
[136:35.58]Thanks for calling a cab.
[136:37.56]Yeah, now we both have to walk you idiot.
[137:00.20]It's a good song for this.
[137:12.83]Come on, get up that.
[137:16.97]Sport mode.
[137:22.31]Do it.
[137:23.63]Come on, do it.
[137:26.69]I got an idea.
[137:42.67]Use the lower gear.
[137:43.47]There we go.
[137:49.21]Almost there.
[137:49.69]Come on.
[137:53.11]It is dawn.
[137:53.99]I just took out a tree.
[137:58.48]No, it's back.
[137:59.54]It's fine.
[138:02.44]Okay.
[138:05.90]I think I can bang a right here now and turn it around.
[138:08.53]There we go.
[138:11.51]Let's do it.
[138:15.37]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[138:16.23]Where do I want to go from here?
[138:17.23]I want to wrap around.
[138:18.31]Okay.
[138:20.73]I need to get a bunch of speed off of this.
[138:28.58]Just like Tony Hawk.
[138:29.32]Here we go.
[138:30.32]Go.
[138:32.18]Come on.
[138:36.71]There it is.
[138:54.62]All this mud is everywhere.
[138:56.20]I better get the 20 grand for this.
[139:19.49]I can't wait to listen to the Chrono Trigger soundtrack again.
[139:22.95]It's going to be awesome.
[139:24.19]I'm looking forward to it.
[139:35.23]Got to go fast up here.
[139:36.17]I got to keep the speed up.
[139:41.11]I'm going to see exactly why I need to keep speed up.
[139:55.25]Good.
[140:04.07]Come on, punch it.
[140:05.91]Come on, do it.
[140:07.87]Come on, excited, loud scream.
[140:13.59]Yes.
[140:36.50]Oh, fuck.
[140:37.24]I just gotta jump.
[140:42.47]We don't give a fuck.
[140:43.67]We don't give a fuck.
[140:44.85]We don't give a fuck.
[140:46.04]We don't give a fuck.
[141:07.32]He don't give a fuck.
[141:08.48]She don't give a fuck.
[141:09.66]We don't give a fuck.
[141:10.82]I don't give a fuck.
[141:11.90]We don't give a fuck.
[141:13.04]We don't give a fuck.
[141:14.22]We don't give a fuck.
[141:18.12]Why are you singing this?
[141:27.81]I made it.
[141:29.27]What's this?
[141:34.85]Oh, it's delivery?
[141:35.85]Nah.
[141:42.61]Do I have that much more to do?
[141:44.59]Did you see that?
[142:03.38]Hey, just checking.
[142:03.94]Are you still level 19 in the Barrens?
[142:08.38]I may as well be there right now.
[142:09.88]Uh, yeah.
[142:15.60]I'm still level 19.
[142:19.10]No.
[142:21.36]No.
[142:27.63]Yeah, Chaos Chris is still alive.
[142:34.89]I need more speed.
[142:35.73]Hold on.
[142:47.98]I'm running out of gas.
[142:50.76]Oh no, that's bad.
[143:03.86]I'm holding the gas down.
[143:05.02]It's not enough.
[143:20.52]Come on.
[143:23.80]Holy shit, dude.
[143:25.20]How is a taxi gonna get up here?
[143:26.98]I gotta be easy on the gas, though.
[143:36.89]We have to pretty much coast.
[143:38.74]On downhill segments, I have to coast.
[143:40.62]No gas.
[143:40.98]No gas.
[144:15.56]I think I can flip it.
[144:23.04]If I dump it down this ditch, it'll flip over.
[144:43.62]That's water?
[144:48.32]That is water.
[144:50.90]I actually think it's going to be fine, though.
[145:00.97]If I get it right on the edge like this and I just dump it, it's going to flip over and land perfectly.
[145:07.45]Trust me.
[145:08.03]Trust.
[145:09.71]Let me get your trust for a minute.
[145:10.75]Hold on.
[145:15.58]There's enough room right there.
[145:17.36]As long as I go right where that dip is.
[145:18.57]Gotta make sure that it actually goes, the wheels go first.
[145:44.01]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[145:59.63]And just want to make sure no pressure or anything, but tips are appreciated.
[146:16.64]Wait.
[146:20.22]That's actually fine.
[146:23.02]He's still in the car, right?
[146:25.76]We're good.
[146:29.06]You just... I just killed myself with a... No, I... I... No, no, no.
[146:35.38]I pushed him over and I killed him accidentally and then I fell down too and that killed me too.
[146:48.37]Oh, shut up.
[146:49.87]We just survived.
[146:53.82]Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
[146:55.66]I'm trying to make a funny joke and I fucked it up again.
[146:57.80]Whatever, just get me back on the road.
[146:59.02]I was going to do a thing with going over the fucking... Let me try.
[147:03.18]Just listen.
[147:03.62]This is what was going to happen.
[147:04.42]That would have been so perfect, too.
[147:08.17]Let's try it again.
[147:18.10]So, I mean, I would appreciate if you were to just let me do the driving and you go ahead and... Okay, I can't do that.
[147:24.82]Apparently, you can't drive over this.
[147:26.62]Okay.
[147:49.64]Where are you fucking going, by the way?
[147:52.28]And yes, I said the big F word.
[147:54.20]Big fuck.
[147:56.10]I emphasized it like crazy.
[148:10.18]I don't think I can even drive over this.
[148:22.10]My knuckles.
[148:23.54]My knuckles.
[148:28.62]Okay, at what point are you just gonna like... Just start punching it?
[148:33.54]I don't know.
[148:38.68]This is burning all my money.
[148:50.54]Drive around it?
[148:59.84]I think I have to line the wheels up perfectly.
[149:01.86]Well, we're just going to dump them.
[149:07.04]I'm losing money every time I do this.
[149:10.78]Need to go faster?
[149:11.66]Is this a jump?
[149:15.70]Or do you just... Maybe it is a jump.
[149:18.88]I think you're right.
[149:19.32]I think it is a jump.
[149:23.41]Well, this is all messed up now.
[149:44.17]I can't get roadside assistance unless I kill him.
[149:54.46]What is wrong with this guy?
[149:55.68]Can I?
[149:57.32]It says it's R. It doesn't work.
[150:04.77]What the hell just happened?
[150:08.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[150:08.61]What did I just do?
[150:09.11]What did I just do?
[150:09.57]What happened?
[150:10.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:11.36]What happened?
[150:11.72]What happened?
[150:12.06]What happened?
[150:13.97]What did I just do?
[150:14.61]Did it crash?
[150:21.28]I didn't hit respawn, did I?
[150:23.90]No, I didn't.
[150:29.17]I didn't press that button.
[150:34.19]Is he still there?
[150:42.48]I did you pressed respawn I but it didn't give me that screen did it like the screen didn't pop up did that screen pop up wicked fast and I just no I can teleport to my vehicle can I oh it's over it's over
[151:12.57]I didn't, I feel like I didn't press.
[151:14.01]I was looking for the shit.
[151:17.99]Well, that was fun.
[151:20.33]Oh man.
[151:20.85]I really wanted to see that through.
[151:24.35]You took a taxi.
[151:26.09]What?
[151:30.45]Look at your purchases.
[151:33.45]How do I see my purchases?
[151:42.17]Okay, I have 18,000 for... How do I see that?
[151:48.95]It's in the chat?
[151:49.73]How do I open the chat?
[151:52.01]I took a taxi for $100.
[151:53.09]I am the taxi.
[152:02.02]So I didn't respawn, I took a taxi?
[152:04.14]I'm very confused, but it's alright.
[152:07.94]Uh...
[152:11.73]So I took a taxi to get away from that.
[152:14.07]Alright.
[152:15.91]I actually like this game a lot.
[152:16.97]I think it's fun.
[152:18.51]It's just called Motor Town.
[152:25.48]We're going to move to the next game.
[152:27.32]The next game is the deck building game.
[152:33.89]I already have it.
[152:34.65]It's installed, so it should be ready to go.
[152:39.81]And also big shout out to the Everhood soundtrack.
[152:45.42]I feel like that was really cool.
[152:48.16]Got us in the mood.
[152:49.14]Alright, give me one second while I open it.
[153:01.39]I can't believe I took a taxi.
[153:02.43]I don't even know how I did that.
[153:08.78]Okay, let's turn that off too.
[153:11.58]We don't need a soundtrack anymore, I don't think.
[153:15.84]In case we do, I will pause it.
[153:17.18]Alright, let's play this one.
[153:19.30]Let's check it out.
[153:29.76]Rogue Light Deck Builder.
[153:36.02]I love the patch notes for this game.
[153:38.56]The patch notes say, first patch, I think I fixed everything.
[153:43.59]Well, I think it's fixed now.
[153:45.75]And then after that, another patch, I'm pretty sure I fixed everything.
[153:53.46]That's alright.
[153:54.34]This one might be pretty good.
