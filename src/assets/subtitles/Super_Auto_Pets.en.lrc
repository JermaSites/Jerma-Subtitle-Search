[00:03.63]Hey, sorry, everybody.
[00:06.90]My cat rolled all over my Twitch computer.
[00:10.96]And my cat, I have a piano that's over here that's hooked up to the screen and hooked up to my computer.
[00:17.45]Cat walked over the piano.
[00:18.59]I didn't mean to turn the stream on.
[00:22.47]Hey, good morning.
[00:24.11]How are you?
[00:30.01]So yeah, it's early.
[00:33.23]I was up late last night preparing for this exact moment.
[00:40.54]I know a lot of you are probably really confused as to why there's a stream right now.
[00:46.15]I'm participating in Ludwig's Super Auto Pets Tournament.
[00:52.33]That's right.
[00:54.45]In a game that I have a collective...
[00:58.04]The hour and 12 minutes in the game.
[01:02.60]I'm gonna get fucking annihilated.
[01:04.46]I was cramming for an exam, yeah.
[01:16.54]I was up late last night because...
[01:20.73]I was like, oh man, that game looks really cute and really fun.
[01:23.19]What a cool looking game.
[01:25.51]I saw Ludwig play it.
[01:26.77]And I saw other people playing it too.
[01:30.64]And then late last night, I found myself saying, you know what?
[01:36.30]Yeah.
[01:37.28]I think it's time to cram for that exam that I told Ludwig I would be in like a week ago.
[01:44.96]So I watched the Northernlion tier list.
[01:47.80]You know.
[01:49.06]Just trying to get an idea.
[01:50.33]I played for a little while.
[01:57.91]I actually.
[01:58.69]This is not a joke.
[02:00.22]I'm making this.
[02:01.04]This is not me making something up.
[02:02.70]This is for real.
[02:04.18]I fell asleep last night.
[02:06.83]with Northernlion telling me how good and bad things were, the different animals, while I was sleeping with the iPad on my chest.
[02:16.01]I was just sitting there with iPad on chest, listening to him.
[02:25.41]My eyes are closed and I open it up.
[02:27.15]I think the videos, it's like a two and a half hour video.
[02:31.16]I started the video.
[02:33.43]It was just like, fuck, I'm tired.
[02:34.95]I gotta know, though.
[02:36.55]I need to know.
[02:37.05]And I closed my eyes, and I kind of woke up.
[02:40.01]I think like an hour had gone by, and he was still going through the list.
[02:46.23]I think I absorbed some info.
[02:52.95]But, yeah.
[02:56.39]I'm very prepared to just be the first enemy.
[03:03.01]Of level 1.
[03:06.09]For all the people playing in the tournament today.
[03:10.09]His voice sounds so sleepy.
[03:12.20]Well, it's because I woke up 20 minutes ago.
[03:17.24]I literally rolled out and got out here.
[03:22.20]I told you I was up all night studying!
[03:26.27]The reason why I'm live... Ugh.
[03:30.23]20 minutes early Because I want to play around and everyone's I look I don't even care how bad everybody thinks I'm playing I'm not I can't even look at the chat because people gonna be like holy shit.
[03:41.00]Did you suck you got how fucking dumb are you I?
[03:45.56]Think I just barely learned what the what the alligator did that was about 15 minutes ago Let me tweet this
[04:02.60]okay yeah this is um this is and this stream is only going to be as long as the tournament is that you know I actually kind of like the voice I like half of this voice you know how you don't you know how you wonder how does the guy on the radio sound like this well it's because the guy on the radio is it's about seven or eight a.m and they they have wake up voice and they use wake up voice to their advantage
[04:33.68]See, by noon, 12 o'clock Eastern, by the way, this is gone, and those guys talk normally for the rest of the day.
[04:46.89]Sonic is the funniest movie of the year.
[04:49.91]That's my favorite joke of 2020, and nobody even voted for it.
[04:59.08]Nice hot voice Andy.
[05:03.35]Howard Stern.
[05:06.95]That hates me, Howard Stern.
[05:08.93]No, it's just being really close to a microphone with a deep voice and a compressor.
[05:16.40]When you get really close to a microphone and you have a compressor on, what it does is it takes your voice and it just transports it into everybody's minds.
[05:26.00]It's crazy what radio's done.
[05:27.26]You know?
[05:27.72]What's the next question?
[05:29.28]Uh, Phil?
[05:35.37]Alright.
[05:38.47]No, I don't want to run a fucking virus scan.
[05:44.42]I have to warm up.
[05:46.56]I actually don't even know how this is going to work, but we'll figure it out.
[05:54.72]What is this exactly?
[05:55.60]Alright, let me show you what this is.
[05:57.91]It's a game we're going to learn together before the tournament.
[06:04.37]Why is my chat not even in dark mode?
[06:07.99]What?
[06:08.17]Okay.
[06:10.25]There we go.
[06:14.45]I don't know, it's not, it's not McAfee.
[06:21.98]I should, maybe I should.
[06:23.78]Alright, here we go.
[06:27.26]So, this is Super Auto Pets.
[06:30.84]Yeah, yes, you can see, you can see my name.
[06:33.68]My name, I know at this, I'm not going to be able to play on this fucking account ever again, probably.
[06:45.15]Yeah, my name is Bert Ernie.
[06:46.96]Bert Ernie.
[06:51.32]This over here.
[06:53.48]Alright, so.
[06:55.26]This is just, okay, you know, you ever play like auto chess?
[06:58.30]I haven't, but I played Battlegrounds.
[07:02.34]Hearthstone Battlegrounds is apparently very similar to this, and it is.
[07:06.20]Very similar.
[07:08.38]Which, if Hearthstone Battlegrounds is just team fight tactics, whatever it is,
[07:18.51]That's how it works.
[07:20.26]You get in the game.
[07:21.48]You started with them.
[07:22.36]And by the way, I've got, I've got hats on.
[07:24.41]There's hats.
[07:27.18]I've got to just make sure I keep an eye on this Discord over here.
[07:30.98]Because I don't want to miss the call time.
[07:34.12]It's very cute.
[07:35.04]Okay, it's just like Hearthstone, Battlegrounds, just like probably Teamfight Tactics.
[07:41.11]I saw, I was, I'm like a reviewer.
[07:45.39]I check out, you know, games that have come out that are new.
[07:48.61]And by that, I mean I watched Ludwig play this.
[07:52.07]And then I said, wow, that looks cool.
[07:53.25]And he said, hey, do you want to play in a tournament?
[07:54.44]And I was like, sure.
[07:55.42]And then I realized that it was today.
[07:57.88]Okay.
[07:59.40]So, it's just like this is the attack, this is the heart health.
[08:04.38]What did you study?
[08:05.08]I told you I fell asleep with Northernlion's tear list.
[08:08.40]I was on my chest.
[08:11.29]No, I wasn't on my chest.
[08:12.97]I was on my... I was on my...
[08:29.73]Okay.
[08:30.07]Alright.
[08:31.91]I'm gonna try.
[08:33.39]I just spilled coffee all over me.
[08:35.59]I'm not even fucking ready.
[08:36.97]Oh, alright.
[08:41.60]Alright.
[08:42.12]No, I'm not.
[08:42.86]I'm tired.
[08:43.60]I just woke up.
[08:45.46]Everybody relax.
[08:47.68]I'm laughing and I'm very disheveled right now because I just dropped a hot coffee on my chest and I don't have any clothes on.
[08:55.93]I don't have clothes on, so I just burnt my chest.
[09:00.49]Okay.
[09:04.21]So, you really want to get, like, a... The pig sucks, from what I hear.
[09:09.65]But they fight on their own.
[09:11.05]It's automatically, right?
[09:12.17]So, I'm going to... Let's just go with cricket.
[09:15.27]Everything costs three gold.
[09:16.21]That includes the food, which is this sometimes gives permanent buffs.
[09:20.60]Sometimes it gives something temporary.
[09:22.26]Sometimes it might give health and, I almost said mana, but health and attack.
[09:28.98]So, we got a cricket.
[09:30.86]And rolling, you can roll, which gets you other ones to choose from.
[09:33.98]You're using the pay to lose pack.
[09:38.79]I didn't know what the rules were.
[09:44.07]Okay.
[09:45.01]So, you gotta get stuff up there.
[09:48.55]As Northernlion says.
[09:52.04]Forget about being the big brain tech guy.
[09:54.78]And go for wins.
[09:56.28]You don't tech into something.
[09:58.06]This is what I've been taught.
[10:00.42]By the best.
[10:01.38]By the way.
[10:05.22]Beaver's good.
[10:05.80]Beaver's alright.
[10:07.36]It's 2-2.
[10:09.05]Mosquito's pretty good.
[10:10.09]Mosquito throws a mosquito dust at somebody.
[10:14.29]To start.
[10:17.11]And you'll see how this works.
[10:19.63]Are you ready?
[10:20.19]Here we go.
[10:22.77]Name your team.
[10:23.39]The fishy lawnmowers.
[10:25.79]It's fine.
[10:27.33]No facecam.
[10:27.99]No way.
[10:29.92]I don't know how this works.
[10:34.44]I don't understand how the matchmaking works, but there's no time limit like there is in Hearthstone.
[10:39.96]I killed that guy.
[10:40.96]Got the hit there.
[10:41.62]That summons another cricket.
[10:43.85]And then there you go.
[10:45.95]Automatically does it.
[10:47.73]And there's your first win.
[10:50.08]There's no audio.
[10:53.50]Oh, okay.
[10:53.94]Well, there should be now.
[10:58.23]The audio is broken.
[10:59.75]I got it.
[11:00.03]I got it.
[11:01.75]Okay.
[11:02.45]So, if you lose, you lose a heart.
[11:05.59]And after turn three, if you lose, you lose three hearts.
[11:10.56]And I know what you're thinking.
[11:11.72]I know what you're thinking.
[11:12.30]Look, over time, over the course of like a few days, you get these back.
[11:16.80]I'm just kidding.
[11:22.96]So the cool part about this, and the reason why I think it's cool, I like it.
[11:27.68]No, that's, it's just, that was a lie.
[11:29.87]Don't believe that.
[11:31.31]This game does not have, could not connect to server, but it's alright.
[11:36.53]Are you sick?
[11:37.23]Yeah, let's just say yes.
[11:39.31]So if I have a cricket, I can upgrade this cricket by, uh oh.
[11:44.86]Uh oh.
[11:58.12]What happened?
[12:01.48]Did I get, like, banned?
[12:04.20]Oh, there we go.
[12:04.80]Alright.
[12:11.27]Sick.
[12:11.61]Yeah.
[12:12.01]Alright.
[12:13.79]So, I got, uh... Beaver.
[12:18.45]So, okay.
[12:19.14]So, everybody has a certain thing that can happen, right?
[12:23.42]So, when I sell beaver, I do sound, like, fucked right now.
[12:27.27]So, if I sell the beaver, he's going to give two random people one health.
[12:30.65]Wait, permanently, which is a big deal.
[12:35.59]Servers are bad.
[12:36.61]That's alright.
[12:39.53]I'm going to go.
[12:39.96]You know what?
[12:40.44]I'm just going to fish.
[12:43.44]Win early.
[12:44.04]Win early.
[12:44.56]Win early.
[12:45.10]Win early.
[12:45.50]That's what I've been told.
[12:47.88]Win early.
[12:48.48]Do I want to upgrade the beaver?
[12:54.24]Because if you take a copy, put it on top of what you had there twice, bang, level it up.
[13:04.41]Is that the beaver right now?
[13:06.61]I don't know.
[13:08.35]And I'm going to lose the tournament, so don't worry.
[13:11.27]But this is really fun.
[13:11.99]The game is actually really fun.
[13:16.75]I feel like that's a waste.
[13:18.69]Oops.
[13:18.97]Well, it did it anyways, I guess.
[13:20.24]Okay.
[13:22.72]Let's roll.
[13:28.39]Do I buy the food?
[13:29.15]No.
[13:29.51]We're just going fish.
[13:30.10]We're going fish at the back.
[13:33.00]I can combine this after.
[13:34.00]Let's go.
[13:40.05]Oh, you can freeze stuff too.
[13:40.93]I probably should have froze the ant.
[13:49.98]Yeah, I have maybe an hour or two in this game.
[13:54.84]And I'm going up against fucking literally, like, the Galileos of this game.
[14:02.39]No, that's not a draw.
[14:13.48]Oh, well.
[14:17.42]You studied, though.
[14:18.38]Yeah.
[14:22.38]Alright, so some of these are really, really cool.
[14:24.46]Like peacock, right?
[14:25.12]When a peacock gets hurt, it gets two attack.
[14:30.97]When the porcupine dies, it does two damage to everybody.
[14:36.53]And the dromedary... I can't be live.
[14:47.32]What am I doing here?
[14:48.58]What am I doing here?
[14:50.08]What am I doing here?
[14:53.44]I can't be in this.
[14:54.94]I can't do this.
[14:56.50]I'm going to get fucking beat the first round.
[14:58.70]And I'm going to like burp at somebody.
[15:04.65]Okay.
[15:06.25]So.
[15:09.69]Stay calm.
[15:10.07]Stay calm.
[15:10.41]Alright.
[15:10.59]I'm going to stay calm.
[15:11.35]I'm relaxed.
[15:12.05]Yeah.
[15:12.43]I'm relaxing.
[15:13.31]I'm fine.
[15:14.01]I got confidence.
[15:15.87]I should be just fine.
[15:23.72]Okay.
[15:24.90]I think we're about to start.
[15:25.83]Oh no.
[15:29.05]Oh no.
[15:34.37]I thought I was gonna have at least like 20 minutes.
[15:36.26]Oh shit.
[15:40.60]They said, hey, jump in the general.
[15:43.68]Oh.
[15:44.56]Okay.
[15:45.00]Alright, I gotta pretend like I'm not freaking out about this.
[15:48.30]You know what I mean?
[15:49.22]Like, the battleship tournament was... I knew what I was doing.
[15:53.26]I know the game very well.
[15:54.18]It was like, oh, Jerma, look, we're gonna do a battleship thing.
[15:57.27]I have no idea what's going on right now.
[15:58.47]And I, like, have to put out the air that I got completely together here.
[16:07.19]Um... Hello.
[16:09.45]Well...
[16:14.30]What's it called, Ashley?
[16:15.91]Hello?
[16:16.85]Super Auto Pets.
[16:18.69]Hello?
[16:19.97]Hello.
[16:21.09]Hello.
[16:21.39]Yo, what's up?
[16:23.65]What's going on?
[16:25.73]I'm so tired.
[16:31.19]What are we starting?
[16:36.02]Soon?
[16:38.38]Lud said we can be 10 minutes late, so I'm assuming we're starting in 10 minutes.
[16:42.96]Okay, cool.
[16:46.68]That's a freaking out.
[16:47.49]I just muted indefinite.
[16:48.29]I'm freaking out.
[16:49.15]Alright.
[16:49.69]Alright.
[16:55.87]Let's go.
[16:56.11]I got to finish at least this thing here.
[17:05.28]Everybody, everybody is stoned.
[17:07.78]Okay, let's go back to what I was doing.
[17:12.88]No more fucking around.
[17:21.18]Alright, so when you get the fish to level 2, they give everybody 1-1, which is pretty good.
[17:31.21]But I don't know if I want to do that right now.
[17:35.34]This will kill... Well, the word is faint, right?
[17:39.80]You're not muted?
[17:40.30]Yes, I am.
[17:44.34]Sell the beaver now?
[17:45.40]Yeah, that's actually a good idea.
[17:46.84]But I can't get over 10 gold, right?
[17:52.89]My mic is muted, okay?
[17:55.33]I can see it over here.
[18:00.39]No, not muted to you guys.
[18:01.57]Muted to everybody else that's in that call.
[18:10.30]Okay.
[18:12.82]Can I... What if I do this?
[18:17.90]Hear me out.
[18:23.41]So let's combine the fish.
[18:25.77]And then do I want peacock?
[18:33.36]Why would anyone ever not put the hedgehog first?
[18:37.64]Because that hurts everybody.
[18:38.50]Is it talking about me?
[18:44.92]No, they're not.
[18:47.40]Ludwig is literally muted in here.
[18:49.80]I can see people.
[18:51.42]Should I pull the head?
[18:51.97]You want me to try it?
[18:55.66]Um, I don't even know what I'm looking for here.
[18:57.16]What do I want to even try to do?
[18:58.60]Let's go peacock.
[19:00.48]When the peacock gets hurt, then it's like a frenzy mode.
[19:08.40]Alright, so let's keep the peacock back here.
[19:10.14]Unless I can get some food.
[19:13.19]Let's roll for it.
[19:13.91]Should I give her the cricket?
[19:25.62]Spider is good.
[19:30.64]I think spider is just a better cricket at this point.
[19:39.11]Alright, so do I get two spiders?
[19:43.17]Sell the beaver?
[19:43.65]Or should I just level up the spider?
[19:51.31]Or should I cupcake the peacock?
[19:59.54]Sell the otter.
[20:00.16]Yeah, I'll do that.
[20:02.88]Let's do that.
[20:06.13]That's what I wanted.
[20:06.79]Alright, we got two spiders.
[20:10.75]I don't want the shrimp.
[20:13.47]I do want this, though.
[20:14.37]Because this just adds... This is one of the buffs.
[20:19.88]Okay, it looks like people are trickling in.
[20:23.28]Ludwig's watching you?
[20:25.60]Yeah, but I mean...
[20:30.61]Honey, okay, I want the honey as well.
[20:32.89]Having honey at the last person, the first, like, five rounds is incredibly important.
[20:37.39]Spider only, that's not how it works.
[20:43.30]Why do they have little hats on?
[20:44.50]I put them on.
[20:47.06]Called me profoundly new.
[20:55.04]But... No, you have no idea.
[20:57.70]I was up all night last night preparing for this.
[21:02.87]I'm going, I'm going peacock, whale, cheetah.
[21:07.87]And it's gonna, it's gonna, everyone's gonna be in a lot of trouble.
[21:17.12]I just won a game.
[21:23.76]Oh, I like this one.
[21:25.31]Okay, bat is S tier.
[21:27.13]I know that for a fact.
[21:28.61]I know it for a fact.
[21:30.39]So, I gotta... Okay, I need to roll for a fish.
[21:39.40]I want bat.
[21:41.71]I want bat, but I want spider to have this.
[21:43.81]Because it's just five more damage.
[21:45.57]Just permanently.
[21:46.15]Unless it's taken off, of course.
[21:49.19]Alright, let's give this to you.
[21:50.47]Because that's just a win.
[21:51.75]Now, what are we looking for?
[21:52.65]Excuse me, what are we looking for?
[21:54.53]I actually don't remember.
[21:58.71]But we're going to combine the spider.
[22:07.77]So now, at the start of battle, this makes somebody weak.
[22:10.27]And all weak is... It took me a while.
[22:11.85]It took me about a couple hours to figure this out.
[22:15.67]So weak is just like an equipment slot.
[22:18.87]You see on the right?
[22:19.43]It's a bone attack.
[22:20.95]Attack for five more damage.
[22:22.85]Honeybee.
[22:23.41]Summon a 1-1-B after fainting, right?
[22:26.29]It replaces that on anybody that it hits.
[22:30.30]They're starting.
[22:30.80]Literally last night entry.
[22:34.06]Jerma, why are people coming in my chat saying he's blazed?
[22:38.87]saying that I'm having like people come in here talking about how you have ancient peyote that the lions used thank you for that I I do not I do not I've just that was very um well look the game we have some beginners can you explain the rules please like I don't even know how the game works I just installed it 15 minutes ago
[23:04.36]So the game, very simply, is an auto battler.
[23:08.65]You form a team of five, the best team you possibly can, and the team will battle against a random person.
[23:14.78]So we're going to enter a 16-person lobby.
[23:17.28]Everybody in this call will be playing.
[23:19.92]And then the top eight people from that giant group will go to a single elimination bracket.
[23:25.71]Just the sweaty people.
[23:26.87]Just the stans of the worlds.
[23:28.21]Okay?
[23:28.55]The yetis.
[23:29.83]Let's relax.
[23:30.41]Let's relax.
[23:32.77]I'm here to have fun.
[23:33.25]The bottom eight will go to a different bracket.
[23:35.69]Alright?
[23:35.95]A less sweaty one.
[23:36.93]The me youngs.
[23:38.21]Okay?
[23:38.53]The people who aren't so good at games.
[23:40.36]I'm going to get rolled.
[23:41.62]I have a chance.
[23:42.42]Why is that called that?
[23:44.44]everybody gets uh so the winner of each one will get their own award um if you win the champion bracket you get your own custom hat in game it's a trophy hat so you're the only person in the world who has it if you win the losers bracket you get a joker hat um and then also 4k for winner of champion 2k for winner of losers is that alright
[24:10.86]That's badass.
[24:11.26]Thank you.
[24:11.54]That's pretty cool.
[24:12.77]There's money?
[24:13.51]What?
[24:13.89]Let's go.
[24:15.29]I just want a hat.
[24:16.48]I just wanted the game.
[24:17.04]I want the hat.
[24:17.70]It's like triple my bank account.
[24:19.20]Yeah, the hat sounds amazing.
[24:21.88]So that's pretty much it.
[24:23.58]That's pretty much it.
[24:24.46]This is not sponsored by... People keep saying I'm sponsored because I keep playing this game.
[24:28.84]It's mostly because there's this bald guy on Twitch that I've watched a decent amount lately.
[24:32.35]Hello.
[24:34.49]Oh, Northernlion.
[24:37.29]Oh, I fell asleep to him last night.
[24:39.15]This guy in the past 24 hours.
[24:40.87]And to help out, by the way, I have a Discord channel for all of you because it doesn't make a lot of sense for all 16 of us to talk on a Discord.
[24:51.30]uh wait that sounds mean that's not what I mean like oh hey I fall asleep to you all the time dude no no no no I mean like I was I I gotta correct that I gotta correct the record like right now but I can't like interrupt right uh and I I predict if you win this it'll go max like three four hours and if you lose right away it'll go like 90 minutes to two hours
[25:14.46]How do I jump in and correct this?
[25:16.38]That was not like a, hey dude, I fell asleep to your stream last night.
[25:20.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, God.
[25:21.46]Too much time has passed.
[25:22.60]Nobody's talking.
[25:40.79]Nobody's talking.
[25:48.23]I didn't catch the last part.
[25:55.90]Okay, this is going to be a fun stream, but I'm having a great time right now.
[26:00.64]I thought this was going to be a gamer stream where I got to focus.
[26:03.79]I got to really pay attention.
[26:05.31]No, no fun right now.
[26:06.59]I'm trying to win.
[26:11.50]point yeah I should have I should have clarified I did forget about that fact um hold up actually let me abandon this uh so for this one uh everyone use the free pack just for the large one that makes sense whatever you want if you duck strat you're lame just calling it out right now I'm not gonna do it
[26:35.65]I brought this.
[26:36.31]I swear.
[26:37.37]Don't do it.
[26:38.29]Don't do it.
[26:39.37]What's the duck strat?
[26:40.57]It's where you buy ducks for five turns and no one will use the DLC.
[26:44.33]Don't leak my strats, bro.
[26:45.73]Well, I think, you know, there's no gift to the ducks.
[26:50.63]I've never played this game and I'm probably going to get rolled because I don't even know what I'm looking at here.
[26:56.32]I'm sure you'll find it.
[26:59.00]Is there like a tutorial that I can look at?
[27:02.45]Tony?
[27:03.19]I just picked the cutest ones.
[27:05.19]Guys, I have no idea what I'm looking at here, man.
[27:08.35]I need like a tutorial or like a breakdown video.
[27:12.40]Ooh, it's kind of a little too late for that.
[27:14.66]Northernlion, now's your time to advertise.
[27:17.75]I have a three-hour-long tutorial video.
[27:19.65]If you watch it on, like, 15X, you might be able to digest it.
[27:24.67]Just go to Northernlion tier list, Super Auto Pets, go to the very end, and then just look at that, and then buy the S tier.
[27:32.50]Yeah, that's pretty much how I started.
[27:35.62]That's what I fell asleep to last night.
[27:37.00]I was lying there with the iPad on my chest, just trying to cram for the exam, and I was on the Northernlion video.
[27:44.87]You're going to take that over the line?
[27:46.05]He said he fell asleep to that.
[27:47.31]It's long.
[27:48.67]It's really long.
[27:49.51]It was like 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.
[27:51.35]I put the playlist on and tried to absorb it while I slept.
[27:55.58]By the way, I think scientifically that doesn't work, Dan.
[27:59.00]Well, looks like you gotta try again tonight.
[28:01.06]And I'll put some more mid-rolls in that.
[28:03.41]See if it works.
[28:09.71]Oh, the lobby's up.
[28:10.67]Alright.
[28:10.91]No, new lobby.
[28:13.42]Oh, the new one?
[28:15.06]Yeah, I'm adding... Was there any rules that I needed to know when I missed?
[28:19.26]Or is it just go for it?
[28:21.45]No, you're good.
[28:22.55]Alright.
[28:23.31]Just pack one.
[28:24.31]Yeah, pack one for the first round.
[28:28.23]So we're just doing the same.
[28:29.83]Yeah, everybody can just kind of hop in.
[28:33.77]Wait, how do I join?
[28:36.53]So you go to private game join and then you type in the code I put in chat.
[28:44.82]It's because I didn't start it, Miong.
[28:46.20]I kind of... I kind of... Prejacked.
[28:49.03]Make sure you don't leak.
[28:49.99]It's very easy to do it.
[28:51.39]Is it easy to leak?
[28:52.11]Yeah.
[28:52.95]Yeah.
[28:53.81]Join private.
[28:54.69]Then... Enter game name.
[28:58.11]Okay.
[28:58.51]Miong wins.
[28:59.08]She gets paid and gets subs.
[29:00.24]Yeah.
[29:01.30]Don't say that.
[29:02.90]It's a rule.
[29:03.44]Okay.
[29:04.04]Okay.
[29:05.77]Should I join or am I just going to capture your stream or screen share?
[29:10.89]Yeah, my idea was everyone will enter their own call and then screen share.
[29:15.38]So you can easily bounce around watching POVs.
[29:19.54]Makes sense.
[29:23.26]But let me see how many people are in this.
[29:25.68]Yeah, Ray is not streaming.
[29:28.16]I'm going to get there in a second.
[29:29.36]Is it like a spectate mode?
[29:30.84]Why is there 17?
[29:31.52]Oh, wow.
[29:31.80]This really is super easy to leak.
[29:35.26]Yeah, it just shows the... It's just there.
[29:37.76]Until it starts.
[29:39.06]No, I did not leak.
[29:39.82]No, I did not.
[29:43.26]Okay, wait.
[29:43.74]How many people on this call?
[29:44.61]Okay, there's 14.
[29:49.45]Alright, so I think we're just missing Sykuno and Mango.
[29:54.51]And then we're set.
[29:58.62]And I think one person in this call hasn't joined.
[30:00.64]Is that right?
[30:05.67]I haven't joined, but one extra person in addition to you.
[30:11.63]Okay.
[30:12.01]Okay.
[30:15.33]You know, there's a chance Northern line.
[30:17.19]I don't know how much you want to risk it.
[30:19.03]I don't think it'll go that long.
[30:21.74]If you want to hop in and play.
[30:24.98]Here's the thing, okay?
[30:26.84]There's two things.
[30:27.92]One is I already have a one-of-one hat in the game, so I wouldn't want to take both of the one-of-ones.
[30:33.98]That's rude.
[30:35.49]And then the other one is I think my chat really has high expectations.
[30:39.81]They expect me to win, and that's a lot of pressure because there's a lot of good players, a lot of good analytical thinkers here.
[30:46.75]So I would rather just sidestep the entire –
[30:50.29]uh issue there and just commentate instead and act superior from an ivory tower and then you 1v1 the champion like in the end of Pokémon elite four hey that could work whoever wins plays Northernlion at the very end that would be it's like Pokémon if every time that someone loses you just say oh they should watch my tier list actually the tier list is out of date with the new patch uh I need to do a retcon but I digress
[31:18.31]uh psychono code is in general yep I'm already in it does it does this code leak after the lobby is something we have to hide on the screen once you go into the game you're good once we're live I think we're good yep uh I think is this everyone missing three people I think
[31:46.14]Unless I'm terrible at math, I feel like everybody in this call, if they joined, we would be at 16.
[31:54.75]I heard a distant whisper from 5UP.
[31:56.35]I did not know what he said, though.
[31:59.21]I can mute.
[32:00.23]What are you saying?
[32:04.29]Wicked rude.
[32:06.25]Who, me?
[32:07.74]I haven't even talked.
[32:09.32]Why am I wicked rude?
[32:11.96]I think I need another coffee, though, for sure.
[32:17.39]The best part about like having being a streamer that's in a call with a bunch of other streamers is like I can just leave.
[32:24.95]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[32:27.53]I think he was in the bathroom.
[32:29.51]I think he's going there.
[32:31.61]Okay, okay.
[32:33.03]Do I have time to grab a coffee?
[32:34.71]Yeah, go for it.
[32:35.65]Anthony, you're in?
[32:37.29]Yes, sir.
[32:40.29]Perfect.
[32:40.63]Alright.
[32:41.73]Love that for you.
[32:42.55]Alex, you're in?
[32:43.69]Yes, I am.
[32:44.85]Wonderful.
[32:45.17]Buddha?
[32:46.73]Oh, there's 16.
[32:47.17]It was the pooping man.
[32:50.81]Can we have help from chat or no?
[32:51.93]Can you just join and then do the old just drop from it?
[32:58.66]Oh, sure.
[32:59.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:00.52]No problem.
[33:01.72]Then it'll start when he joins.
[33:03.86]I guess we should wait a moment.
[33:05.00]So after it starts, just hop in your own Discord and then just Discord screen share.
[33:09.15]You can just mute or deafen.
[33:10.51]Oh, Discord screen share.
[33:13.45]And then that's just an easier way to spectate.
[33:15.51]Oh, shit.
[33:16.31]I might have boned Jerma right there.
[33:17.98]Alright, we're in.
[33:18.92]Uh-oh.
[33:20.29]Did we restart?
[33:23.31]We might need a classy restart because I did tell him to go get coffee and then I forgot it automatically.
[33:30.51]Back out, back out.
[33:33.83]More chances for Ducks.
[33:35.87]Good thing I got bad RNG.
[33:38.70]I had three Ducks, man.
[33:40.12]I had three.
[33:41.98]I'm actually not playing Ducks because I hate them.
[33:44.10]We were abandoning, right?
[33:44.98]It's on principle.
[33:47.24]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[33:48.32]I respect it.
[33:48.80]Everyone's on the standard pack.
[33:49.86]Unless I get three.
[33:50.94]Yeah, you have to play standard pack.
[33:52.08]Yeah, we're leaving, right?
[33:53.12]Same code, same code.
[33:55.50]Wait, are we leaving?
[33:56.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:58.16]This Jerma's going to get coffee, right?
[33:59.36]Wait, are we going to do the same code?
[34:01.89]It's going to... Yeah, do the same code, but everyone can't join at once because if it starts again, we'll have the same problem.
[34:06.75]Right, so everybody's got to leave first.
[34:09.21]It's not letting me join the same code.
[34:14.35]Well, that's here.
[34:17.13]well yeah I can't join either no we're just we're just waiting I think uh no you're good wait so I've never played this before am I allowed to get help from chat or like or is that like a no go no no absolutely please do okay alright cool
[34:42.47]Yeah, because I'm going in this blind, man.
[34:43.95]I have no idea what I'm looking at.
[34:46.35]I think a few people are going in blind, and I think that's why we have the bottom bracket.
[34:51.30]It's going to be hilarious.
[34:52.30]It's going to be funny.
[34:53.12]It's going to be good content.
[34:54.42]I don't know what we're going into, guys, and it's going to be fine.
[34:57.74]We're going to get absolutely rolled by the pros, but that's okay.
[35:00.44]Alright, new lobby code, normal line.
[35:02.28]I don't need to join this one.
[35:03.28]We'll commentate together and hop through.
[35:05.30]Understood.
[35:05.77]Alright.
[35:10.11]So 11 a.m.
[35:10.87]is early.
[35:11.27]Is this what I'm understanding?
[35:12.62]Yes.
[35:14.04]It's late for me.
[35:16.20]It's late for you?
[35:17.54]No, it's a joke, but I do wake up at like 9 a.m.
[35:19.72]right now.
[35:22.05]Bro, the sky's up at 4 a.m.
[35:23.49]in Japan, dude.
[35:24.77]I woke up last night and he's like, what time is it?
[35:30.81]I was like 11 hours from now.
[35:31.77]He's like, yeah, I'll just stay up.
[35:33.93]No, actually, I went to sleep for like four hours.
[35:37.15]Yeah, I had to.
[35:38.83]Wendy and I were awake at 7 a.m.
[35:40.16]and we're like,
[35:41.62]shouldn't go to sleep we're not going to wake up dude I got two I woke up to two flight messages from me young and mango both going like hey I'm back don't hate me but I might not be there I'm back sorry if I'm holding everybody up I gave you my word I didn't cook for the house to be here I appreciate that it's a nice afternoon here in New York that's all I'm saying okay bad news I think myung stream effed oh she's back oh
[36:10.94]I already lost a match maybe your internet no no no we had to we backed out for you so you can back out oh okay okay new code it's in general we have three more people who need to join we're good apparently mango because he's not on the call was playing against bots he's like wow dude so good he literally said I was on a run
[36:41.01]What happens when you win?
[36:42.71]Alright, I think we almost have everyone.
[36:49.55]We just need two more.
[36:52.64]What's the win condition?
[36:53.44]Is it collecting a bunch of trophies?
[36:55.14]Like all the trophies?
[36:57.00]Are we betting on Mango and Myeong?
[37:00.28]I think it's Myeong one and I don't know if the other is Mango for sure.
[37:08.24]So if you get all the trophies, that's like a win condition.
[37:11.14]Like, what would you consider a win?
[37:13.84]So the way trophies in versus is its lives and you will die and run out of lives.
[37:23.67]So you just need to live longer than the other people in this call.
[37:27.55]Okay.
[37:28.17]I see.
[37:28.39]I don't know exactly how they calculate how many lives you get because I feel like it varies sometimes.
[37:36.17]In the regular game mode, would you guys consider seven crowns to be good?
[37:41.96]Like eight crowns to be good?
[37:43.20]What's like, alright, that was a good run.
[37:46.30]Yeah, seven and eight's good.
[37:48.02]Yeah, seven and eight's great.
[37:51.04]So when I get like four... I don't think anything under ten, personally, but I can appreciate seven.
[37:55.04]What about between like three and five?
[37:57.56]Is that considered okay?
[37:58.66]Well, I should get at least five.
[38:01.70]did you hit it with a higher number and then where you're at yeah four is the only bad ones because you should just play for you should swing for the fences right zero is better than four so do you guys just leave game like you just abandon game if you have no no because then you get a dunce hat nowadays they patch oh yeah the game makes fun of you you have to play it out like a hero
[38:27.05]wait do I get a dunce hat if I already abandoned them no if you abandon a bunch you're fine oh only pubs or something alright yeah the arena resetting for that perfect triple fish staying so knowledgeable uh I think it's just me young I think she's having some audio and stream problems that just f yeah I'm also just downloading Steam so I need to say I'm just said at least we know he has friends
[38:56.80]What?
[38:57.12]Oh.
[38:58.38]Yeah?

[39:08.51]I've been wearing a Dunsat since, uh, at least 10 years ago, okay?
[39:14.04]You should play, see if they'll play Among Us after this.

[40:22.35]I'm unmuting when I have to ask somebody something.
[40:25.77]I'm not just talking over everybody right now.
[40:35.82]Will, is it just you at this moment?
[40:37.95]I have it.
[40:38.47]How do I join the game?
[40:40.09]Versus, and then there's a code that Ludwig posted in Discord.
[40:44.45]Versus, and then join private?
[40:46.74]Okay, got it.
[40:48.54]And then just the name.
[40:50.26]Don't say it out loud, because people can just snipe it.
[40:53.80]I'm definitely leaked.
[40:56.54]Go, Will.
[40:56.92]Go.
[40:57.06]It should be fine as long as Will joins in the next 13 seconds.

[41:04.82]So we go to our individual discords.
[41:07.56]Okay.
[41:07.86]Own discords.
[41:08.38]And then go live on Discord showing your perspective.
[41:11.06]Yo, good luck, guys.
[41:11.92]Good luck.
[41:12.62]You might have to pull me from my stream.
[41:14.34]You guys are going to need it, man.
[41:16.15]You're going to need it.
[41:16.83]You're about to get smacked, man.
[41:19.59]Okay.
[41:19.97]I can't do that.
[41:20.59]I'm on my phone.
[41:21.85]You're good.
[41:23.15]Okay.
[41:24.93]I'm not sure I can do that and I have like program authority problems doing that for some reason.
[41:31.20]Alright, here we go.
[41:33.10]I'm ready.
[41:34.44]Are you guys ready?
[41:36.02]We're not on like a time limit or anything, but I don't want to be slow.
[41:38.16]So hold on.
[41:38.52]Let me turn this up.
[41:43.24]Alright.
[41:43.64]So turn one, I, uh,
[41:48.49]Alright.
[41:49.71]There is a timer.
[41:50.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:51.41]What do you see a timer?
[41:52.61]Don't say that.
[41:53.23]Stop lying to me.
[42:00.42]Oh, did I do it?
[42:05.50]I didn't know there was a timer.
[42:07.56]What the fuck?
[42:08.94]I look so stupid.
[42:12.16]This is somebody that's never installed the game once.
[42:15.20]I can't fucking believe it.
[42:17.92]I didn't know there was a timer.
[42:19.12]Oh, god damn it.
[42:20.92]That's... It's over.
[42:26.66]Like, I've fucked up everything.
[42:29.18]This is bad.
[42:29.70]This is really bad.
[42:30.84]Okay.
[42:32.93]I didn't have a chance.
[42:33.87]Okay, sell.
[42:36.29]Give two random friends one health.
[42:37.83]Alright, I have to have at least two people for this.
[42:39.31]Let's do bird again.
[42:45.56]and um beaver I'm so I'm so thrown off it's over I'm on the wrong pack oh Jesus oh no how am I able to play in the game I just am not prepared
[43:10.47]Okay.
[43:11.63]Why am I... I have the wrong pack.
[43:13.73]This is... Oh, my God.
[43:15.37]I thought once we got into the game, it would be alright.
[43:18.48]But, like, I'm in the wrong pack.
[43:19.92]I may as well just fucking lose and just watch YouTube videos.
[43:39.13]Okay, so...
[43:41.38]I don't know how I'm going to salvage this.
[43:42.72]I thought I was going to do okay.
[43:44.74]But this whole thing started as such a disaster.
[43:47.26]Alright.
[43:47.48]Here we go.
[43:49.32]I mean, does this really matter anymore?
[43:51.74]This is the worst team that's ever been put.
[43:53.59]Ever.
[43:59.99]What do I want?
[44:01.39]Alright.
[44:01.87]I have to at least go.
[44:02.79]I have to get something on somebody.
[44:04.17]Now he's going to do seven damage.
[44:12.92]uh not the cat spider I take so long to do these decisions that's why I'm not used to the timer did you lose oh absolutely like literally the first two three turns like this is turn three
[44:40.91]You're not live on Discord.
[44:42.15]I don't think I can.
[44:46.22]The way that I capture through OBS, it always screws up.
[45:00.32]Let me see if I can get it to work.
[45:05.45]Is this going to work?
[45:14.70]Oh, not the webcam.
[45:22.13]Yeah, I can't get it to do my video.
[45:25.49]I've tried this before.
[45:26.55]I'm going to be the first to be eliminated after this.
[45:29.92]I just have to take this loss completely.
[45:32.62]Why am I throwing?
[45:33.94]I'm really not even trying to.
[45:35.38]I just have the wrong pack.
[45:37.90]And I missed the first two rounds.
[45:41.31]Alright, here we go.
[45:44.59]I need another.
[45:52.98]Nah, I don't think I can do the rat right now.
[45:54.44]Let me do this.
[45:59.03]Mmm.
[45:59.19]Do I get the two peacocks?
[46:01.13]I think so.
[46:09.97]Okay.
[46:11.05]Well, this fish frees fish.
[46:15.22]And I gotta move this.
[46:17.39]So this is, alright, I need to be here.
[46:20.43]Who do I want to have that attack?
[46:24.03]You.
[46:25.53]Okay, alright.
[46:26.01]Let me see, share my, let me try to, let me see if I can get it to work.
[46:33.98]Bind the fish?
[46:35.62]Yeah, I gotta freeze him though.
[46:52.04]Oh, that's actually really good.
[46:54.82]That's really good.
[46:57.72]That might be the save right there.
[46:58.88]No, definitely not.
[47:08.53]And less?
[47:08.91]I don't think so.
[47:14.33]No, too bad.
[47:23.11]I'm guaranteed to be the first person out.
[47:35.16]Alright.
[47:36.26]Can I salvage this somehow?
[47:39.34]I'm sitting there talking like a dickhead.
[47:41.16]And I wouldn't pay any attention to this.
[47:47.38]Should I give...
[47:50.60]Okay, if I find another fish, then this is potentially salvaged.
[48:02.54]I'm gonna give this to the peacock because garlic on the peacock is great because you want the peacock to get hit.
[48:08.44]Alright, give me a fish.
[48:13.00]This is good though.
[48:13.98]This is really good.
[48:15.86]I have to get rid of somebody.
[48:17.36]I have to get rid of somebody.
[48:18.22]The spider, I think.
[48:18.94]I gotta get rid of the spider and I have to put this behind the peacock.
[48:23.14]Oh, the bird?
[48:27.59]The bird has the meat.
[48:38.42]Fuck.
[48:40.12]Okay.
[48:49.05]Alright, come on.
[48:49.81]I gotta pull this back.
[49:02.48]I'm dead.
[49:03.16]It's not enough.
[49:06.20]That turn one.
[49:07.40]Turn one just killed me so bad.
[49:09.82]I can't.
[49:14.60]Okay, aren't we doing another one?
[49:15.76]We're doing more than one.
[49:17.22]I'm going to fail the first one, obviously.
[49:18.58]Alright, here we go.
[49:19.18]Finally.
[49:19.72]Alright, alright.
[49:20.26]This is important.
[49:22.45]I want to freeze you.
[49:24.61]I want to give the meat to somebody.
[49:26.91]Alright, this is going to give one one to everyone here.
[49:32.41]I got to roll.
[49:32.89]I got to roll for another peacock.
[49:39.14]Okay, hold.
[49:39.72]Okay, alright.
[49:40.58]We got...
[49:43.91]Look at that.
[49:45.25]Llama.
[49:46.49]If you have four or less pets, that's not going to work.
[49:49.25]But we're going to do this.
[49:53.31]Oh, shit.
[49:54.15]Okay.
[49:54.71]I got to get rid of somebody.
[49:55.53]Who did I get rid of?
[49:56.99]Probably the fish at this point needs to go.
[50:00.27]And I'll replace fish with rooster.
[50:03.33]I think that's play.
[50:05.19]And I'm going to give rooster the meat bone.
[50:06.97]Oh, okay.
[50:08.63]Or the chicken, maybe.
[50:09.35]Maybe.
[50:14.74]Check behind the rooster?
[50:15.62]Alright, who do I sell, though?
[50:21.73]Who do I sell?
[50:22.25]Who do I sell?
[50:22.71]The fish, probably.
[50:23.29]Fuck, I don't have enough time to think about this.
[50:26.23]I have to sell the fish.
[50:28.77]Put the rooster up.
[50:31.26]And then... I don't want to save any of these people.
[50:34.57]Okay.
[50:35.01]Alright.
[50:35.37]Alright.
[50:35.69]Hold on.
[50:36.09]Freeze you.
[50:37.25]And then... Oh, God.
[50:38.11]Oh, my God.
[50:38.49]Oh, my God.
[50:38.77]Oh, my God.
[50:39.07]Oh, my God.
[50:39.37]Where do I go?
[50:40.85]Here.
[50:41.25]Here.
[50:41.43]Like that.
[50:42.37]Okay.
[50:42.51]Because this... Yep.
[50:43.53]Alright.
[50:43.79]We're good.
[50:44.29]Everything's fine.
[50:44.71]Because he gets the buff from the bird.
[50:49.45]Alright.
[50:49.69]Alright.
[50:52.28]Come on, Gwen.
[50:52.78]Let's go.
[50:53.10]He's got the garlic armor.
[50:56.88]Garlic armor means you take two less damage.
[50:59.26]This is going to be a win.
[51:03.00]No, it's not.
[51:04.22]Fuck.
[51:04.58]That was so much overconfidence, but nothing.
[51:06.10]I actually think I'm okay.
[51:14.17]Well, I didn't lose.
[51:18.05]Oh, that's right.
[51:18.69]He summons the chick.
[51:19.53]Okay.
[51:22.43]Wowee.
[51:23.19]Oh, wowee.
[51:32.30]Let's do this.
[51:32.99]This sucks.
[51:42.27]If you buy a tier 1 pet, give current and future pets 1-1.
[51:45.94]I don't... Bison seems pretty good if you have a level 3.
[51:52.94]I like this game, but I'm not very good.
[51:54.96]Alright, I need to figure this out.
[52:00.71]I don't want any of these.
[52:06.99]The dog might be alright.
[52:08.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[52:09.79]No, he's not.
[52:11.41]No.
[52:13.83]Let's just feed some people because he gets buffed from food.
[52:17.47]And... Um... Uh...
[52:30.30]Worm is actually kind of good, but I don't know if I want to keep the worm over the potential... Okay.
[52:44.19]Alright.
[52:57.13]I just need a warm-up round.
[53:01.40]That's fine.
[53:02.74]That shark is going to be a big problem, though.
[53:06.04]This is a problem.
[53:07.29]But, I can last a pretty long time here with that Galakama.
[53:11.93]That's fun to say when you've fucking lost it, isn't it?
[53:17.01]That's alright.
[53:17.96]I can handle it.
[53:20.80]God damn it.
[53:21.88]What is this?
[53:29.76]Alright, if you're watching my perspective, I didn't play the first two rounds.
[53:32.62]I didn't know there was a timer.
[53:33.46]I was talking to chat about pancakes and waffles and shit.
[53:35.82]I didn't know there was a timer, and I'm using the wrong pack anyway, so I'm disqualified.
[53:38.64]So I'm out.
[53:47.43]Oh my god.
[53:49.01]Is anybody else out?
[53:50.99]Oh, okay.
[53:51.53]Other people were out.
[53:53.07]It wasn't just me.
[53:53.63]I was in the first one out.
[54:03.78]Alright, let me get in there with the right pack, with the right mindset, with the right everything.
[54:09.06]You know what I mean?
[54:09.55]Let me get back in there.
[54:13.49]Oh my god, he gave 35 subs.
[54:15.39]Tommy B, thanks a lot.
[54:22.42]Time for the comeback?
[54:23.18]Yeah.
[54:26.72]Lower bracket legend.
[54:29.22]Well, I'm... Finish the tier list.
[54:40.32]Yeah, I have to go here.
[54:47.94]Alright.
[54:48.97]This game is really fun.
[54:50.09]But... Alright, we need to change the hat.
[54:52.93]Let's put the flower hat on.
[54:55.83]Okay, I'm ready now.
[55:02.53]He cheated and he lost.
[55:06.86]I feel like people are just clapping for me because I'm the old guy.
[55:11.84]You know what I mean?
[55:14.20]Like, oh, Jermba, yeah, come on over to the tournament we're going to do.
[55:17.34]Oh, yeah, there you are.
[55:20.22]Hi.
[55:20.74]Yep, your seat's right there, Grandpa, right at the end of the table.
[55:27.10]I clicked to use a different pack that everybody else is using.
[55:31.20]Yep.
[55:32.22]Grandpa, hi.
[55:35.42]I don't even play the first three rounds.
[55:38.60]Oh, did you see?
[55:39.10]Grandpa just took, just, just, I have to pay $2.
[55:41.64]I landed on Park Place for Grandpa.
[55:45.26]Which I was generous.
[56:03.36]You're not, I know, I'm just kidding.
[56:06.90]I was kidding, don't worry.
[56:12.82]So, who's actually winning?
[56:14.26]Should I just watch one of the other perspectives?
[56:18.18]Or should I just do some practice?
[56:27.89]Practice?
[56:30.79]Well, good luck and congratulations to all the winners.
[56:35.01]Let's do some practice.
[56:36.96]Alright, ant.
[56:38.44]If I had a second, you know what I mean?
[56:39.74]Like, I would have already done this shit.
[56:41.09]Like, horse is bottom tier.
[56:42.63]Absolute zero.
[56:44.57]And there you are.
[56:45.21]And there it is.
[56:47.43]And there it is.
[56:48.65]That's a great starter.
[56:49.67]We're gonna be the shy... We're gonna be the shy feet.
[56:58.53]The frigid legs.
[57:00.04]I like that one, too.
[57:05.38]Yeah, I like this one.
[57:12.47]So now we got a team, right?
[57:20.87]Rigid legs.
[57:26.45]Okay.
[57:34.58]It's fine.
[57:37.00]Mosquito's good.
[57:37.76]Alright, now this is important.
[57:38.82]We're gonna give this to... Who do I wanna give this to?
[57:40.84]We'll get a beaver.
[57:44.35]And maybe a mosquito, just to round it out.
[57:48.31]And then we're going to give the... Let's roll.
[57:53.17]Okay, this is good.
[57:54.08]This is really good.
[57:57.66]Should I do this now, though?
[57:58.66]Or should I wait?
[58:00.72]Because technically, you get Tier 2, and then you can go to Tier 3, right?
[58:06.19]Okay.
[58:09.38]Because when you get to three of the same, right, when you see me combine stuff, when it's leveling up the creature, when you do that, it gives you the next tier.
[58:18.51]It pulls from the next tier of animals for you to play with.
[58:23.23]So shouldn't I wait for that to happen for us to go to tier two so that I can just get a tier three?
[58:30.20]That's kind of next turn, yeah.
[58:33.70]From my understanding.
[58:34.92]So then I'm going to freeze you and give this just to the person in the back, which is, by the way, a guaranteed win.
[58:42.74]Early on, if you honey the back line here, this person here, it's pretty much a guaranteed win because nobody does that.
[58:59.82]This should be a pretty, this should be it.
[59:00.84]I think it's going to be alright.
[59:06.67]Everybody does that?
[59:07.51]I know.
[59:08.57]Still gonna lose.
[59:18.72]Ugh.
[59:24.05]Okay, so now I have tier two.
[59:26.39]This is where... Combine this.
[59:29.95]I want somebody else up here, though.
[59:31.17]And I don't want it to be a cricket.
[59:37.81]Should I start summoning?
[59:38.53]Nah, I don't have anything that synergizes.
[59:45.09]I don't have anything that synergizes with the dog.
[59:48.86]Is this the worst stream of the year?
[59:51.88]Well... Yeah, write it down.
[59:56.02]I actually, I don't think so.
[59:57.84]I don't know.
[59:58.34]I feel like this is gonna get good.
[60:01.16]Bind the fish?
[60:01.72]Yeah, but I want another person to get the 1-1.
[60:06.33]Hmm.
[60:07.29]Okay.
[60:07.51]Well, I know I'm doing this.
[60:08.43]Because it's just so good early.
[60:15.44]Maybe beaver?
[60:16.06]Hmm.
[60:22.77]Copy health from friend ahead.
[60:27.25]Uh.
[60:31.35]Every time he attacks, he hurts the person behind him.
[60:32.99]So you need somebody that takes like a hurt.
[60:34.67]Does this.
[60:36.79]Hmm.
[60:37.65]It's really funny watching you fail.
[60:38.81]It's probably why you got invited.
[60:39.85]No, because... Hey.
[60:45.92]Now I can't afford the fish.
[60:47.96]Oh, shit in my pants.
[60:49.12]You're right.
[60:49.98]I'll do it next turn.
[61:04.98]Hmm.
[61:07.29]Spider, I guess.
[61:08.09]Spider should be up front, too.
[61:15.19]This is annoying.
[61:19.03]And then this will kill.
[61:20.64]And then... Yeah, that's fine.
[61:29.88]Remember, you suck at this game.
[61:33.04]Yeah, well, you know.
[61:35.84]That's fine.
[61:37.32]I think this is a win.
[61:41.81]Hey!
[61:47.89]I still think I got this.
[61:51.45]Wow.
[61:52.19]Um, never mind.
[61:54.23]No, I do.
[61:55.28]Yeah, I got it.
[62:00.08]Why does he only read from the rude chats?
[62:03.27]Because I have this third-party app that just shows only specific keyword users and stuff.
[62:10.38]So, loser, stupid, idiot, dumb, slow, hurry up, too slow, speed, brain.
[62:23.23]Brain's a big one that I look for.
[62:24.47]Yeah, I take my time.
[62:30.75]Sorry.
[62:33.24]I take my fucking time.
[62:39.55]Holy shit.
[62:41.31]Okay, so let's go with... I want the swan.
[62:44.87]The swan is very good.
[62:46.43]So I'm gonna get rid of the mosquito.
[62:50.00]Before I do that... This is... No.
[62:55.10]No.
[62:55.80]I'm gonna do a big brain play.
[62:57.84]Okay.
[62:59.85]If I kill this, it'll give its 2-1 to you.
[63:04.19]Put up the goose.
[63:06.57]Do the level up.
[63:07.55]And then here we go.
[63:08.37]1-1.
[63:08.93]There's the giraffe.
[63:10.67]End turn.
[63:11.17]Give friend ahead.
[63:12.05]1-1.
[63:12.65]Ooh.
[63:16.79]Is that better?
[63:17.53]Should I get rid of the beaver now?
[63:25.60]I think so.
[63:33.11]Nice.
[63:33.81]Okay.
[63:34.87]Let's put the giraffe up.
[63:35.75]Fuck it.
[63:37.57]Why did it say that?
[63:39.11]It's the only time it's ever said the name of any animal.
[63:41.49]Okay.
[63:54.72]Oh, that's good.
[63:56.25]The dodo bird.
[63:56.81]I like the dodo bird.
[63:57.73]Um...
[64:02.97]Okay, new Jerma frogs.
[64:04.39]You can call a Jerma a dumbass.
[64:05.70]Yeah, that's fine.
[64:11.08]Hmm.
[64:12.64]Giraffe to spider.
[64:14.02]The spider is going to start to get a little beefed up.
[64:20.35]Maybe not.
[64:21.31]We'll see what happens next turn.
[64:23.37]I want this, though, because I want it for the spider.
[64:26.47]Alright, let's go.
[64:29.46]I lose.
[64:30.08]I got like frozen halfway through that one.
[64:34.51]It's too early.
[64:50.88]Too bad it's the giraffe that's gonna get the melon armor, which you get one hit for free.
[64:55.17]And he's gonna just buff up this guy.
[64:58.91]Um... Just barely.
[65:05.66]Just barely we get to have a draw.
[65:20.90]Badger, when it dies, deal attack damage to adjacent pets.
[65:24.48]That kind of sucks, though, doesn't it?
[65:38.51]Shit.
[65:39.21]Ooh.
[65:45.51]The ox is good, too.
[65:46.77]I'm keeping the ox.
[65:48.15]And should I replace, um...
[65:52.57]What should I replace with this?
[65:54.41]I'm freezing everything.
[66:00.80]And a peacock.
[66:01.28]Don't want a peacock.
[66:01.88]Alright, this should be good.
[66:02.55]Next round.
[66:08.37]Yeah, I'll get rid of the mosquito.
[66:16.14]The spider will start to carry.
[66:18.04]When the spider starts to carry, that's where it's going to get good, right?
[66:21.77]So I can get over, I'll get rid of three of his first three characters.
[66:29.01]Do I have enough to kill his dodo?
[66:31.88]Oh god.
[66:33.98]I, it's going to be, yeah I do, I went.
[66:39.32]That's why you always put the bee in the back.
[66:44.83]Give something to the giraffe?
[66:45.75]Yeah.
[66:50.37]I think mosquito goes away.
[66:52.13]Alright, who am I going to give the garlic to?
[66:53.47]The swan?
[66:59.23]I think swan gets the garlic.
[67:00.69]He's got the most health besides spider.
[67:02.00]I'm going to sell the mosquito.
[67:13.06]I'm going to buy the ox...
[67:19.52]So now the Ox, when this thing dies, it summons something, which when that dies, so he's going to get this twice, and Melon Armor, and he's going to get hit with 1-1s.
[67:32.73]So he's going to be buffing the Ox.
[67:36.07]The Ox now needs the Garlic Armor.
[67:38.89]And then we round it out with Leveling Up Spider.
[67:45.97]I think that's alright.
[67:47.07]Let's see what happens.
[67:58.14]So, the tournament.
[67:59.00]I think they're still doing it.
[68:03.02]They have players here that are really... Oh my god, that was 30 damage.
[68:08.25]So, it just ended?
[68:08.83]Alright, well, we'll get into it.
[68:11.75]See what's happening here?
[68:14.03]Every time somebody dies in front of him, he gets to get two more health.
[68:17.11]I mean, two more damage.
[68:19.25]That worked out, but... Mmm...
[68:23.41]I think this is a win.
[68:25.48]This is... Oh, no, it's not.
[68:27.90]Damn it.
[68:35.03]They're waiting for you?
[68:35.77]Let me find out.
[68:44.81]Through.
[68:46.08]Hey, you think... Will...
[68:48.16]it's unfortunate you did make it through because you slightly cheated there by using the pay to impact listen I was told I could use whatever pack I wanted to I did the same thing you were you were told that yes uh this was the common conception among the pro circuit
[69:14.75]I'm glad I wasn't the only one.
[69:16.71]I got... I'm sweating.
[69:19.80]I was here and prepared like yesterday too.
[69:22.44]And it's like, oh yeah, we're not doing the expansion.
[69:24.52]What did I do?
[69:27.32]You used the pay-to-win pack, and I said it was free-to-win only for this one, and then I said the main lobby.
[69:33.75]Oh, my bad.
[69:34.69]I didn't even know.
[69:35.25]I was using a browser version.
[69:36.65]Yeah.
[69:37.15]You know, I think we'll let it slide.
[69:40.74]I honestly don't think it's, like, a big difference maker.
[69:43.56]I mean, if you don't expect it, it can be a little weird, but I don't think pay-to-win is better than free-to-win even.
[69:48.90]Sure.
[69:49.04]Okay.
[69:54.52]I have no idea which bracket I'm in.
[69:57.66]Was I the only one who didn't buy pets on the first round?
[70:00.72]No, I didn't either.
[70:06.33]I'm sitting there.
[70:07.05]I'm sitting there.
[70:08.49]I'm not knowing what I'm looking at, right?
[70:10.57]I'm thinking I'm looking at the fucking starting screen, which I was.
[70:14.59]I go into battle.
[70:15.41]My chat's like, you didn't buy any pets.
[70:16.75]I'm like, what do you mean?
[70:18.13]I literally get rolled.
[70:19.53]And then the second round, I finally have pets.
[70:21.26]And then the people have more pets than me.
[70:23.75]This guy absolutely demolished.
[70:26.35]Every single round.
[70:27.89]I just didn't know there was a timer.
[70:30.39]I set it to the normal pets now.
[70:32.90]I was quite confused.
[70:33.70]You can play whatever you want now.
[70:35.82]I was against the ladybug and then the second round there was a person with one pet.
[70:40.50]Will, you can play any deck in the second half of the tournament.
[70:43.56]Will might be in a 1v1 against me, though, for the eighth spot, so can he use it in that?
[70:47.30]Well, no, no.
[70:47.94]I believe you guys are both in top eight.
[70:50.66]You guys did draw, but you drew.
[70:52.42]So I think it's Logic, Stanz, 5Up, Abe, Yeti, Ray, Dan, and Will.
[71:00.55]And then the other bracket is Wendy, Jerma, Sykuno, Mango, Buddha, Anthony, Otto, Alex.
[71:09.86]very cool I believe is the seating for each not the seating but the the people on each um and then give me just like a couple minutes I'll get the seating up and then we'll start the tournament and everyone can just play one V one at once sounds good let's do it alright did you say we could about any pack this time does it matter on this any pack yeah any packs fine any pack I would just recommend buying I'm gonna play Anthony in the first round please
[71:36.93]Me?
[71:37.45]Yeah, me.
[71:40.03]Just don't buy pets again, please.
[71:43.67]No problem.
[71:44.27]You know what, man?
[71:44.89]I got it for you.
[71:47.31]Nasty little strat.
[71:48.99]You can go ahead and see that one.
[71:50.83]We've agreed to it.
[71:51.69]This game is really fun.
[71:54.39]It is a great game.
[71:56.87]I've been so addicted to it, man.
[71:58.19]Oh, keep playing it.
[71:59.71]So bad.
[72:00.65]I feel you.
[72:08.45]Alright, I'm muted over there.
[72:09.35]Alright, so let me see if I can play this out, because I feel like this is going to get alright.
[72:14.75]So the shark is... The shark is good.
[72:18.47]Yeah, the rest of it is all white.
[72:20.41]I think I get rid of the black.
[72:21.93]I think that someone from the winner bracket plays someone from the loser bracket.
[72:25.68]No, no, it's two separate groups of eight.
[72:28.46]Someone from the winner plays number eight winner.
[72:31.64]That, and then it goes up to the end.
[72:34.46]They're just simultaneous matches, right?
[72:37.22]Yeah.
[72:37.82]I feel like I need to replace somebody.
[72:39.20]Pepper the fish.
[72:40.76]So it's like first and AC or some shit.
[72:43.46]I would assume so.
[72:45.15]I don't know how they roll me.
[72:47.27]Is that what's going on?
[72:48.27]It's way better if they randomize it, though.
[72:49.65]Yeah, they should randomize it.
[72:54.13]Well, I just have a stream, but we had the bracket two, seven, one, eight.
[72:58.20]Oh, no.
[73:00.36]I mean, will and logic.
[73:02.32]Sounds good, too.
[73:02.80]Me versus Abe.
[73:06.65]Do I have time to use the bathroom?
[73:07.89]For sure, for sure, for sure.
[73:10.11]Alright, I think we got like a minute or two here.
[73:19.16]What, he killed it?
[73:20.16]What?
[73:20.72]What happened?
[73:22.32]How did he kill that?
[73:26.35]Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[73:28.29]I'm happy about this.
[73:31.17]Should be able to take a few hits.
[73:36.94]Come on.
[73:38.94]Well, that sucks.
[73:39.74]The whole reason I bought the shark and he died instantly.
[73:41.90]At least you're better at this game than Mario Kart.
[73:52.37]That's the first round.
[73:54.12]I really, I swear to God.
[73:56.54]It was...
[74:01.34]I just wasn't prepared.
[74:02.34]I was, but you know what I mean?
[74:03.54]Like it just, I was all fucked up and I missed the first two rounds.
[74:06.28]And then it was like, at that point I was just buying, I just bought the first three random things I could find.
[74:10.85]This one will be better.
[74:12.01]I promise.
[74:15.74]Skunk is good.
[74:18.46]Ooh, okay, wait.
[74:20.49]I need stuff that dies and comes back.
[74:22.81]Spiders.
[74:24.55]Like, let's get the... Alright, I need stuff that, like, dies and comes back.
[74:30.07]Like, another spider, I guess.
[74:31.59]Ugh, another giraffe.
[74:33.68]This is good.
[74:34.26]Mmm...
[74:46.18]Alright.
[74:46.82]Alright.
[74:47.14]Alright.
[74:53.70]Clown phase.
[74:55.08]You know what?
[74:55.62]Should have just played better.
[74:56.50]You know what?
[74:57.96]You're right.
[74:59.13]Predict the bet.
[75:00.21]Yeah, that's my fault.
[75:01.41]I chose the wrong pack.
[75:02.43]I think we're good.
[75:04.19]I still got time.
[75:05.35]Alright.
[75:06.17]We want that spider.
[75:07.19]I want this pear.
[75:08.57]If I get this to a two, that means he'll give something in front of him.
[75:12.23]Two, two, which is huge.
[75:13.11]Alright, let's go.
[75:14.49]This time, don't die.
[75:19.53]Can you say hello to my friend Ben Dover?
[75:22.89]What's going on, Ben?
[75:24.95]Hope the Dover family's doing well.
[75:30.55]Ooh.
[75:33.57]There we go.
[75:34.11]Alright.
[75:34.89]Feed the hell out of that shark.
[75:37.23]Stop that.
[75:42.62]This might be a victory.
[75:44.36]No, maybe not.
[75:49.65]Do I have enough to get through both of them?
[75:51.27]I think I do.
[75:54.68]No, it's going to be... Yeah, I do.
[76:00.20]No, you'll probably... We could have some friendly banter.
[76:03.38]I don't see a problem with that.
[76:04.50]You could have friendly banter.
[76:06.02]There's no problem with that.
[76:06.88]It's more so for me to spectate and chat.
[76:09.88]When you join... Yeah, we'll just meet up.
[76:13.31]Yeah.
[76:14.95]We'll just hop in.
[76:15.71]I guess if we're not in there, it's totally fine because most people we won't be in there for.
[76:18.67]That's not perfect.
[76:20.51]Entertainment for our own stream, yeah.
[76:23.11]How do we know who we're going against?
[76:25.53]It's in the bracket.
[76:27.16]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[76:31.66]Sorry.
[76:33.58]Do we make the games now?
[76:37.02]Yeah, we'll just... You're going to hop in the call.
[76:39.61]Yeah, make the game against each other.
[76:40.83]To make the game, by the way, if you guys don't know...
[76:43.27]um all you need to do is do create private game hit max players to make the name and then just put it in general chat and at the person alright so who we got here well I should be good to make ours alright logic I'll jump in your little thingamabob and Discord sound good by the way this is a best of one you can use any pack okay and should we get eliminated you're out
[77:10.37]Should we be in the same call as our opponent?
[77:13.15]Yes.
[77:14.07]Okay.
[77:14.97]And then are we streaming our perspective?
[77:18.41]On Discord, yeah.
[77:19.25]I mean, only once you really... I guess it'd be a bit cool if both of you did, yeah.
[77:23.09]Yeah, just stream your POV.
[77:24.78]Okay.
[77:25.42]Yeah, something about the way that my stuff hooks in through OBS, it always shuts off.
[77:30.10]Yeah, Jerem, I know you're shitfucked.
[77:31.32]That's good.
[77:31.78]You're good.
[77:32.70]Sorry about that.
[77:34.38]And also, if you... Don't start round two is the only other thing.
[77:38.57]Oh, okay.
[77:39.73]So wait until everyone's done?
[77:41.45]Yeah.
[77:41.67]Alright, are we good?
[77:44.53]Can I go to stand?
[77:45.81]Yeah, go off, go off, go off.
[77:47.71]Just enter your group, or just enter wherever.
[77:50.91]Good luck, everybody.
[77:52.37]Alright, where am I going?
[77:55.72]Hey, what's up with all the licks in your chat?
[78:00.02]Um, I don't... I don't know.
[78:03.42]I mean, they like licking.
[78:07.88]How did you have my chat open?
[78:09.56]I am restreaming your stream and then putting my face over your face so people don't notice that there's an audio to video delay.
[78:16.86]I appreciate you telling me.
[78:21.94]Alright, where am I going?
[78:23.62]Round one, group four?
[78:26.13]Jerma, you are up against Wendy.
[78:28.99]Wendy, yeah.
[78:30.13]Hi.
[78:31.07]So just any call, Wendy.
[78:32.05]Yeah, you can enter.
[78:32.65]Yeah, I... You know, people didn't really...
[78:35.84]um you know heed to the to the group location oh okay I see I see so you can pick a random one of these rooms you can just pick any room okay how about uh round one group one that sounds good oh there was another round one group one oh is there two of them yeah there's a constellation which is the one where it is
[79:00.37]Well, I did not do very well last round.
[79:02.51]Good.
[79:02.83]I'll be very honest.
[79:03.51]I made the pass already.
[79:04.56]It's a woohoo yay.
[79:06.26]If you check the general channel, I added you.
[79:10.32]Oh, is that the name of the game?
[79:11.88]Because I think that I may have just screamed you saying that.
[79:16.10]Oh, I will remake it.
[79:20.12]Let me get in.
[79:21.88]It's so easy.
[79:26.08]OK, so versus mode, join private.
[79:30.64]Okay.
[79:32.50]Okay, this is the new pass for us.
[79:38.33]Very cool.
[79:40.81]Alright.
[79:41.31]I don't want to leak it.
[79:44.59]Don't leak.
[79:46.57]I think I should be in.
[79:47.61]Alright, so they said don't do a round two.
[79:50.69]We're just doing this once.
[79:51.35]Uh, yeah.
[79:55.15]Alright, well, good luck.
[79:56.39]I believe so.
[79:58.15]How much experience do you have with the game?
[80:01.27]uh I play like a decent amount but I'm not that good at it okay yeah because I've I've been playing for about an hour or two maybe total gotcha I'm gonna try though yeah yeah yeah oh there's a timer right timer name illegal sausages that's me I need a name too
[80:31.10]Did that in the wrong order, but, you know, can't get everything correct every time.
[80:34.75]Sorry, I need a team name, too.
[80:47.15]I took so long.
[80:48.21]I'm sorry.
[80:51.46]The Talkative Piggies.
[80:52.86]How does that sound?
[80:55.06]Ah, well, I've got some piggies on my team.
[80:57.46]Okay.
[80:59.40]You don't got any on yours.
[81:00.96]No.
[81:06.46]I think I'm going otter strat.
[81:09.56]Otter strat.
[81:12.60]15 health.
[81:14.80]Oh, wow.
[81:15.65]This will get interesting.
[81:22.59]We can't really talk strategy because you're right here.
[81:26.91]That's right.
[81:29.63]We can't.
[81:34.84]I got the mute button.
[81:35.92]Alright, what do I do?
[81:37.70]I'm just kidding.
[81:38.12]Why?
[81:38.64]This game... This game has a way of doing weird things.
[81:46.18]Yeah, the servers get kind of hammered, don't they?
[81:51.79]Alright, I think I'm... I ran out of... I ran out of time!
[81:59.35]I'm muted, don't worry.
[82:02.47]God damn it!
[82:16.51]Nice.
[82:16.89]Nice.
[82:17.13]Very nice.
[82:27.46]I'm definitely going to go.
[82:28.34]I guess I'm going to switch it up a little.
[82:29.56]Let's see.
[82:30.86]Hmm.
[82:43.96]Does the buff work?
[82:45.36]I don't know.
[82:46.06]I'm very curious.
[82:47.92]We'll find out.
[83:12.15]The timer gets me like every time.
[83:14.68]yeah I actually didn't know there was a timer in the first in the seating room so I like totally messed up one of my rounds and I was like no yeah I I didn't play uh pets on the first two rounds I don't think because I was just talking oh my god I know I was so distracted I'm just so distractible
[83:46.97]Yeah, I gotta try to try to beef that Dodo up.
[83:48.99]It's gonna be close.
[83:54.23]Guys, I think it's time for Ant
[84:16.56]Don't you think so?
[84:17.94]Get rid of cricket?
[84:18.96]Go for ant?
[84:20.36]No, wait.
[84:20.84]Get rid of... Cricket, go for ant?
[84:25.72]I just said the exact same thing.
[84:30.05]Nothing that I said changed.
[84:31.39]Yeah.
[84:39.47]Okay.
[84:39.73]Is that it?
[84:46.33]The dodo needs... Oh, shit, 30 seconds.
[84:50.33]Um, the dodo needs, uh, a buff.
[84:58.60]Hmm, okay.
[85:03.52]Oh, I realize we should be streaming our stuff.
[85:07.40]Yeah, for some reason, when I try to hook through to do both, it doesn't capture one of them.
[85:12.42]And usually the one it doesn't capture is the stream I'm streaming to.
[85:16.77]I don't know why.
[85:17.25]I think I got a big play next turn.
[85:29.83]Uh-oh.
[85:34.01]I'll see.
[85:39.04]Crab.
[85:44.72]What does a crab do?
[85:46.41]Poppies.
[85:57.74]Dodo is so good.
[86:30.51]Oh, no.
[86:32.21]Did I do that wrong?
[86:33.75]I may have just done that completely wrong.
[86:35.28]Oh, well.
[87:11.36]Oh, that's a beefed up pig.
[87:12.68]Beefy pig.
[87:18.13]Oh.
[87:18.57]Got a beefy mosquito.
[87:48.10]I got a minute.
[88:05.92]I'm sitting there freaking out.
[88:06.76]I thought I had like 10 seconds left.
[88:10.60]I'm also trying to think about my life choices over here, man.
[88:15.44]Oof.
[88:37.46]Hey, OK.
[88:59.37]Alright.
[89:15.73]Oh dear.
[89:17.71]I don't think it's gonna be enough until maybe next round.
[89:20.91]Ooh, that crab.
[89:27.34]That crab getting beefed.
[89:30.64]Yeah, crab's getting beefy.
[89:54.78]I'm not throwing.
[89:56.00]I'm not throwing.
[89:56.88]I have to mute.
[89:57.44]I don't want to sound like a weirdo.
[89:59.08]Like I'm screaming at people.
[90:01.61]I'm not throwing.
[90:04.19]He sucks.
[90:05.93]You.
[90:06.31]No, I'm not going to say you.
[90:07.93]I'm going to say no.
[90:09.45]Leave me alone.
[90:09.93]Okay.
[90:11.45]The play is give the meat to the deer.
[90:13.51]Because the deer is going to do five, six damage.
[90:15.50]And it's going to do five damage to splash damage.
[90:18.12]And then the play after that is going to be... Mosquito...
[90:24.61]No.
[90:25.09]Sell... I'm going to sell the mosquito and put the kangaroo in.
[90:31.97]And then put the kangaroo behind here.
[90:34.79]I don't know.
[90:38.65]Who am I selling here?
[90:39.45]Oh my god!
[90:42.18]I have 20 seconds.
[90:44.46]Oh my god!
[90:45.12]Uh-uh.
[91:01.10]Okay.
[91:07.54]When I play, I usually like take forever to think.
[91:10.50]So this timer is freaking me out.
[91:12.91]Yeah.
[91:14.75]The only experience I have with the game is with no timer, just sitting there, just going, hmm, now I wonder what that would do.
[91:19.91]Yeah.
[91:20.29]I'm just like, hmm.
[91:31.56]I think I'm in trouble here.
[91:37.37]I think that's one or two more.
[91:44.78]Or no, three more and that's it.
[91:48.72]How much health do you have?
[91:49.96]I have five.
[91:50.74]I think like two more.
[91:57.23]I think.
[92:02.50]Hey, that looks good.
[92:03.22]He was saying, why do I still have the otter?
[92:25.07]It's cute.
[92:27.35]And he's got a cute hat on.
[92:30.52]Oh, you have hats.
[92:31.84]Oh, I have little bear hats.
[92:41.62]That's a lot of damage.
[92:46.05]Yeah, got the monkey.
[92:51.01]Oh, the monkey monkey is amazing.
[93:10.68]Alright, well... Let's see what happens.
[93:13.32]This is my last attempt here.
[93:15.38]Let's see.
[93:16.08]Let's see if I can pull through.
[93:20.94]Hmm... Your dual core CPU brain is overheating.
[93:33.87]I have at least a Pentium 3, okay?
[93:47.86]oh shit that's they just gave me like every like top tiered pet in the whole game right now okay pivot angle oops
[94:43.51]Oh You got the turkey in the cow, yeah, I think it might be it might be too little too late though GG
[95:05.36]I wish you luck in the remainder of the tournament.
[95:07.68]Thanks.
[95:10.76]I wonder if... Oh man, I wonder how long it's going to take for the winners bracket to finish and then the losers bracket and then... I have a feeling it's going to go back and forth a lot in those higher... I'm curious as to how those are going to play out.
[95:30.19]Me too.
[95:30.81]I need some more practice.
[95:35.46]Yeah, me too.
[95:38.46]Isn't that why we're here?
[95:41.54]Yeah, Ludwig was like, hey, you want to play in the tournament?
[95:44.11]I'm doing Super Auto Pets tournament.
[95:45.59]And I'm like, sure.
[95:48.39]I'll give it a whirl.
[95:51.82]It's really fun.
[95:52.30]It's actually like a really fun game.
[95:53.82]It is really fun.
[95:54.74]It's also really infuriating.
[96:06.60]Tournament loser speedrun.
[96:10.62]Did I lose?
[96:11.43]Did I lose the fastest?
[96:13.45]I have no idea.
[96:14.73]I think we have to report the winner or loser, right?
[96:29.42]Uh, yeah.
[96:30.26]Do we just put it in general?
[96:34.82]I would assume so.
[96:35.48]Okay.
[96:47.94]Have you played the DLC pack?
[96:50.14]I have, yeah.
[96:52.38]Do you like it more?
[96:53.82]Or... I really can't even tell.
[96:56.06]Because... I like the bugs.
[96:57.86]I haven't played the DLC.
[97:00.12]The bugs are cool.
[97:01.66]The bugs.
[97:02.50]Besides the bugs, it kind of gets messy.
[97:05.15]Let me take a look.
[97:09.23]Yeah, the beetles are cool.
[97:11.33]The... What else we got?
[97:12.41]Is the bat in the main game?
[97:15.37]Because the bat's incredible.
[97:18.34]Sorry, what did you say?
[97:19.68]Is the bat in the base game?
[97:22.94]Um... I'm not sure.
[97:25.16]Because that's probably one of the best abilities in the game.
[97:29.26]To give somebody weak.
[97:32.12]I don't think it's in the base game.
[97:33.86]Yeah, the bat replaces whatever you have for a buff with weakness.
[97:39.34]Oh, okay.
[97:39.88]Yeah, it's not in the base game.
[97:41.46]Yeah, that character is insane.
[97:44.04]Hmm...
[97:47.07]What else is in here?
[97:47.87]The tabby cat's new too.
[97:53.81]Everything is kind of new.
[97:55.05]There's still people in the base game that I have no idea how to play with them.
[98:01.71]Lobster.
[98:02.54]Poodle.
[98:05.26]Yeah, I haven't played with any of those.
[98:12.74]Talk about you being the sus guy.
[98:16.90]What are you talking about?
[98:18.53]What do you do?
[98:19.77]I'm, hey, I'll, by the way, just in case you didn't know, I'm the sus guy.
[98:23.41]I think that would be like a, okay.
[98:26.29]Like, who cares?
[98:28.42]What are you talking about?
[98:31.78]Well, I lost the tournament, but I'm the sus guy.
[98:33.82]I get to keep that.
[98:34.66]That's what I get to keep with me.
[98:36.59]That's like a double loss.
[98:49.10]Do you get points?
[98:50.37]It's 5,000 points to buy a new background?
[98:52.21]Yeah, I think so.
[98:56.39]Let me see.
[98:57.05]Or you can just purchase it, right?
[98:59.47]Oh, yeah, I guess so.
[99:00.85]Oh, actually, no, there's some with like 500 points and like 1,000 points or something.
[99:04.95]I don't really care about the background, so I feel like the hats are way better.
[99:08.67]Oh, yeah.
[99:10.33]I would definitely spend that money here.
[99:14.84]There's a lot of hats, too.
[99:16.53]A lot of cute hats, yeah.
[99:19.21]I love how the 5,000 point one is a golden poop as if that's the thing that shows that you're a true winner.
[99:27.52]How long does it take to get to 5,000 points?
[99:31.16]I don't know.
[99:32.28]I feel like it comes pretty quickly.
[99:36.38]Hey, what's up?
[99:42.53]Wait, I guess he was spying on us and then left.
[99:46.86]Yep.
[99:52.75]Ah, they made new channels.
[99:54.69]Yeah, I think people are moving to the general, I think, temporarily, or new stuff.
[99:58.77]Let's see.
[100:02.97]I need a sus hat.
[100:04.07]I don't need a sus hat.
[100:06.87]Why would I have a sus hat?
[100:13.67]I thought I was muted when I just said that.
[100:15.43]Thanks a lot.
[100:21.23]That makes it sound like that's all I talk about.
[100:24.10]Oh, no, chat.
[100:24.50]There's no sus hat for me.
[100:38.11]Golden poop, yo.
[100:49.39]Early Adopter hat, too.
[100:50.39]This one looks kind of cool.
[100:54.13]Mmm, yeah.
[100:54.83]It's only five bucks, right?
[100:56.66]For the expansion?
[100:58.86]The game's free.
[100:59.84]Uh, yes.
[101:01.22]Yes.
[101:03.50]It's very, very, very affordable for the kind of what you get to play.
[101:07.52]Yeah, and you can also play it on your phone if you have Android.
[101:11.26]Are you serious?
[101:12.96]Yeah, I'm playing it on my phone.
[101:14.72]Oh, my God.
[101:15.53]In bed.
[101:17.13]I have iPhone, which sucks.
[101:20.63]Oh, you have an iPhone.
[101:22.05]Yeah.
[101:23.53]I want to play it.
[101:25.57]Blop, blop, blop.
[101:30.76]I was gonna switch to Android but I just know Apple too- it's all I've used.
[101:36.00]Even though I don't like it.
[101:39.00]Yeah I've also only used like Android mostly except for like I don't know like iPods and stuff.
[101:45.00]Yeah and iPad.
[101:48.00]It's so funny because I was so against the Mac computers. I was like I'm never gonna buy one of those overpriced pieces of shit.
[101:55.00]And then I just bought all their other products.
[102:03.41]Okay, it says we can move to general.
[102:05.97]Okay.
[102:06.99]Okay, I want to move over to general.
[102:09.77]Yeah, go ahead.
[102:10.23]Let's head over there.
[102:12.63]Alright, GG's.

[102:56.05]You guys need to relax.
[103:02.05]Sounds good to me.
[103:04.05]Alright uh let's get it started, you can just join semi groups one. That's Sykkuno... trying to think.
[103:11.97]No, no, excuse me. That's uh auto mango... no that's Dan Ray. I'm smoking reefer. Okay, Dan Ray, you're auto uh you're group one and then auto mango you're group two.
[103:23.00]Sure.
[103:24.00]Uh and auto you just set it up and put the code in general, Mango will join.
[103:26.00]So let me uh- let me just make sure I'm very clear. If I lost that last game, that means I'm out of the tournament?
[103:31.00]It is single elim yeah. You're out from here.
[103:33.00]Okay.
[103:34.00]But thanks for playing Jerma.
[103:35.00]I actually had a great time, it was like actually it was like really fun.
[103:41.98]It feels like a bit of a Jerma game.
[103:44.26]It's a great game.
[103:45.80]I love it.
[103:47.16]Some people have called it the next Battleship.
[103:51.09]I mean, I don't know if I'd go that far.
[103:52.57]It's so addicting too.
[103:55.89]Battleship was pretty fun.
[103:57.09]It was really fun.
[103:57.77]It's good.
[104:02.15]Alright.
[104:02.51]Let's get it started.
[104:03.13]If you guys are... want to spectate or if you're like waiting, you can hop in.
[104:07.23]Just like mute.
[104:08.65]Okay.
[104:09.11]And... Wait.
[104:10.25]So where do I go?
[104:11.15]I go to Semmy's group one or... Number two.
[104:13.78]We're gonna hold your match because we're just doing two right now.
[104:16.30]I'll play for a little bit longer.
[104:17.06]I'm not staying in the stream.
[104:18.46]And then Auto Mango.
[104:20.50]Oh.
[104:20.68]So I watch Ray's game.
[104:22.08]You just watch Ray's game.
[104:22.82]Yeah.
[104:23.28]Okay.
[104:24.13]Thanks for having me, by the way.
[104:25.71]Thanks, Alex, so much for playing, brother.
[104:27.58]Yeah.
[104:28.02]I'll see you guys later.
[104:29.06]Bye, guys.
[104:29.44]Good luck to everybody else.
[104:31.44]Alright.
[104:32.42]Hop in.
[104:32.80]Get it started, you two.
[104:33.86]Or you four.
[104:34.36]Alright.
[104:37.30]And we're going to occasionally hop over.
[104:40.46]Yeah.
[104:40.66]Have a great time, everybody.
[104:41.88]I wish everybody really good luck on all the rest of their games for the rest of the day.
[104:45.47]And I will see you later.
[104:46.49]It was a lot of fun.
[104:56.43]longer I was muted don't worry I'm not a weirdo yeah that stream was gonna be small that was fun look I'm just yeah it was fun what time is it yeah this is gonna I knew this is gonna be a short stream I'll play a couple rounds
[105:21.67]Hi, I'm the sus guy by the way.
[105:23.25]No, I did, I did, okay, my biggest mistake with making like, um, just kind of like talk, just small talk with just anybody, is if I do like the funny voice, that's when it's like, okay, I gotta slow down.
[105:35.49]This is not small talk anymore.
[105:37.33]I'm like, I'm being like a funny guy.
[105:39.95]You know what I mean?
[105:42.92]Like, oh, a piece of shit Macintosh.
[105:45.00]Like, I, that, slow down.
[105:56.94]bit was so bad I'm not even wasn't even making a bit it was just you were so normal I've told you guys this million times before okay
[106:19.45]Like, we can be a weirdo in our own house, right?
[106:23.21]But when we go to somebody else's house, if you get invited to somebody else's house, you don't just grab a microphone in their home and just walk around and just yell stuff.
[106:36.88]They're not prepared for that.
[106:38.92]They don't want to hear that, you know what I mean?
[106:43.16]That's the quickest way to get disinvited to anything else in the future.
[106:48.35]is being in that general chat with like 15 people and being like, hey, hey, so I picked the beaver, and oh, that's kind of where the beaver goes, the beaver makes that sound, and then he goes, and then he gnaws on the corn, and then I put the horse in there, and they'd be like, alright, Jerma, like, fucking, can you stop?
[107:04.46]Like, can you leave the call?
[107:05.54]Like, stop, we're trying to like set this up.
[107:10.67]You can't be a weirdo in somebody, you could be a weirdo in your own home, right?
[107:19.37]You held that all in?
[107:20.27]I heard duck is bad.
[107:24.30]No, that was fun though.
[107:28.52]That was really cool.
[107:34.80]You held... You were holding that in the whole time.
[107:38.55]Host your own tournament where you're in charge.
[107:40.97]Yeah, but that's the thing.
[107:42.33]I could host a tournament and be in charge, but guess what?
[107:46.41]When I send those invites out, people are going to know that I'm the one in charge and they're going to be like, I don't know if I want to hear this dude neigh like 20 times.
[107:58.13]I might get, okay, I might get two people to come to that party, but it's people I don't necessarily want to be there.
[108:03.43]You know what I'm saying?
[108:06.11]Like, if you know the weird guys having the party, you might attract the weird other guy.
[108:11.72]And then you have to out-weird that person.
[108:15.10]It then becomes a competition between who's weirder.
[108:27.05]No, all jokes aside, I wish everybody else luck.
[108:30.72]It was fun.
[108:31.20]I'm glad to have been invited.
[108:34.80]It was very entertaining.
[108:36.64]So now what's going to happen is I'm going to go pee.
[108:40.43]And I'll be right back.
[108:41.41]I'll play a couple more rounds.
[108:42.87]And then I'm probably going to stop after like another 30 minutes or so.
[108:49.89]I'll be right back.
[108:50.81]We'll just chill.
[111:01.79]Thank you.
[113:05.09]Thank you.
[114:31.26]Alright, I'm back.
[114:31.88]Sorry about that.
[114:36.22]That was one of those really, really, uh, weird P's.
[114:43.77]Uh, a weird P. I was peeing.
[114:47.85]And I, like, felt like I still had to go.
[114:51.37]Like I hadn't even gone yet.
[114:53.97]Mid-P.
[114:54.43]You know what I'm sayin'?
[115:00.67]Like, after like a full 20 seconds, it was like I still hadn't gone pee yet.
[115:04.77]I was like, what's going on?
[115:08.27]It was like at the brim for some reason.
[115:11.37]No, I don't have a UTI.
[115:14.07]And then it felt like it was going... Okay, alright, let's do this a little bit.
[115:22.51]We can take our time.
[115:23.27]This game is actually pretty fun.
[115:26.31]I don't think I'm gonna stream this again, but, I mean, I did say this is a short stream.
[115:30.65]But, I think two hours is too short, and four hours is too long.
[115:35.26]It'd be a short stream.
[115:37.30]So, let's see if we can round it out in the next 30 minutes.
[115:42.44]Okay, the horse is- I don't like the horse very much.
[115:45.27]I'm not joking, that's a UTI.
[115:51.36]I'll be alright.
[115:52.56]I don't have a UTI, okay?
[115:57.21]Uh, a beaver is just good early.
[116:02.15]I keep hearing about this duck meta, and I don't really want to listen to it.
[116:07.54]But I feel like, give shop pets 1-1.
[116:10.72]Is that permanent?
[116:15.92]Or is it only the pets that are down here in the shop?
[116:18.95]Or is it a permanent thing to everybody?
[116:24.40]Just those.
[116:25.14]Huh.
[116:26.82]I feel like that's not that good.
[116:29.89]Maybe like really early you just sell them immediately.
[116:34.39]Like next round just sell it.
[116:37.57]I'll try it.
[116:43.01]I don't want the horse though.
[116:43.93]There we go.
[116:48.13]Okay.
[116:50.97]I could do two beavers.
[116:53.27]And just buff somebody up.
[116:58.52]Or fish is just a good, it's a 2-3.
[116:59.76]I'll go with fish.
[117:08.17]Alright, the confused teabags, the folded scouts.
[117:12.83]The precious teabags.
[117:14.69]The precious bikers.
[117:17.35]Oh, the precious teabags.
[117:18.49]Stop buying bees?
[117:30.00]I feel like early the bees are really good.
[117:31.64]And I wouldn't listen to anything I say because obviously I came in last place in the tournament.
[117:37.80]But they just, they seem really useful.
[117:48.21]He is ass most of the time.
[117:51.70]Well, this is good.
[117:52.30]Okay.
[117:55.96]Okay.
[117:59.17]I feel like I know people are telling me, don't do B, but I'm gonna do the B. It's my strategy.
[118:11.23]Alright, do I just want a second 2-3, or should I get a cricket?
[118:14.16]That would be a 1-1.
[118:15.86]Maybe a second fish?
[118:17.28]And I can combine them later?
[118:23.52]That looks good.
[118:27.98]Didn't I just buy?
[118:31.09]If a random friend won one, that didn't happen.
[118:35.47]Why not?
[118:41.51]Did it happen?
[118:46.70]Happens when you buy the otter.
[118:48.74]Only the otter?
[118:49.52]Oh, I thought it was when you buy... Oh, buy any... Oh, okay.
[118:53.12]Oh, shit.
[118:53.48]Alright, that's fine.
[118:59.26]I think this is a winning team right now.
[119:04.67]This looks like a win.
[119:16.64]Jeremiah, I'm convinced that you're me from another universe.
[119:21.04]Not even a win.
[119:21.92]It's just a draw.
[119:33.59]23 mana, 1-1 value is terrible.
[119:36.97]Yeah, you're probably right.
[119:43.22]But... No rat.
[119:50.45]Ant is really good.
[119:51.31]I think we combine fish and get ant.
[120:06.00]I'm thinking Leon for the 10 community subs.
[120:08.18]Community subs?
[120:11.21]Can we have a facecam?
[120:12.37]No, I'm not kidding.
[120:13.81]I don't have a t-shirt on.
[120:16.89]I rolled out of bed and turned on the stream like 30 minutes later.
[120:21.07]I was up all night studying.
[120:25.78]Do I just buff this guy up like crazy to make sure I win?
[120:31.80]Well, that's easy.
[120:41.41]I think I sell the duck next turn.
[120:44.53]If there's a fish, I sell duck.
[120:52.92]You sound tired.
[120:54.18]Well, this is okay.
[120:54.84]So for everybody that's asking, how come, dude, come on.
[120:57.28]How come you don't start at like 10, 11 o'clock in the morning?
[121:00.38]More people would be able to watch your streams.
[121:01.82]What about EU?
[121:02.59]I cannot function before noon.
[121:05.91]I can't.
[121:07.05]Even if I wake up at 8 o'clock in the morning, it doesn't matter.
[121:09.51]I don't function until at least 1, 2, or 3 p.m.
[121:14.55]Doesn't matter when I go to sleep.
[121:15.57]Doesn't matter when I wake up.
[121:18.86]So reliably getting up in the morning and doing a live stream at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock in the morning.
[121:27.04]Which means that, okay, so that means I have to get up around 8 or 9.
[121:31.01]Right?
[121:31.65]So get up at 8 a.m.
[121:32.67]and I'm just not a morning person.
[121:34.15]I've tried a million times.
[121:36.99]It's not going to happen.
[121:39.89]Alright.
[121:41.31]Well, let's do this.
[121:42.55]Hold on.
[121:45.66]I don't want to do this to the duck.
[121:51.12]Oh, god damn it.
[121:53.40]Should I do a second?
[121:54.48]Should I do level two duck?
[122:02.80]Is duck bad?
[122:04.01]Should I just not do duck?
[122:07.09]Oh, what else do I got?
[122:09.91]I like swan.
[122:10.55]Alright, I'm selling duck.
[122:12.51]And I'm getting swan.
[122:14.25]Here we go.
[122:18.70]Nice.
[122:19.74]Here comes the swan.
[122:23.00]And then here comes otter.
[122:25.86]Not bad.
[122:27.50]Shrimp.
[122:29.44]When you sell a friend, give somebody random one health.
[122:31.97]This is the only other thing I'd be selling.
[122:40.05]Although I could just, okay.
[122:44.16]I could kill the ant, give the buff to somebody, and put the shrimp up there.
[122:47.30]Because then I'm going to end up selling the beaver.
[122:53.70]There's no timer.
[122:56.94]I think that's not a bad idea.
[122:58.60]Because if I kill the ant, he'll give the 2-1 to somebody back here.
[123:02.84]And then I can put the shrimp up.
[123:03.90]It's the same stats.
[123:06.24]And then eventually I'll get the 1 health for selling the beaver.
[123:10.76]The shrimp sucks, though.
[123:15.38]I'm gonna go for it.
[123:15.94]Okay.
[123:19.74]I mean, this is gonna be the beefy guy.
[123:22.59]What?
[123:23.81]Oh, it doesn't sell it.
[123:25.05]It just deletes it.
[123:26.69]Oh, no.
[123:27.99]Oh, no.
[123:28.65]It just deletes it.
[123:29.83]I thought it sold it, too.
[123:32.47]Oh.
[123:33.47]Okay.
[123:37.01]I thought I was gonna get one gold.
[123:41.42]Shit.
[123:41.98]No, well, that plan is gone.
[123:43.20]No, what's the reason to just roll the shrimp?
[123:46.78]Oh, fuck.
[123:49.80]And you can control Z?
[123:50.90]No, you can't.
[123:59.95]Copy the health from the friend in front.
[124:01.67]Damn it.
[124:03.67]Oh, that's not good.
[124:08.73]I like the peacock.
[124:09.99]Maybe I'll hold on to the peacock.
[124:13.56]Shit.
[124:13.88]Oh, well.
[124:20.18]Did you get a spider?
[124:20.90]I actually might not lose this.
[124:27.59]They only have four as well.
[124:29.15]I might actually win this.
[124:32.36]Yeah.
[124:33.16]Okay.
[124:33.34]Is this a bot?
[124:39.50]No.
[124:42.22]Please make a joke or do a bit.
[124:45.89]I don't think I need to do that considering the first two hours of the stream was like a joke.
[124:52.06]Honestly, that whole tournament really did feel like I was in a Mr. Bean movie.
[124:57.54]Just in a video game.
[125:00.60]I just was sitting there.
[125:02.52]I made every single mistake.
[125:04.09]I didn't know there was a timer.
[125:05.39]I fucked up the first like three turns.
[125:10.59]You know like I'm playing checkers while somebody else is playing chess?
[125:14.29]No, I'm trying to stay in the lines in the coloring book.
[125:17.26]And they're playing with chess.
[125:21.47]I was not, I was just, I got thrown off so bad.
[125:24.25]Sheep is really good.
[125:25.95]We're gonna do sheep.
[125:28.95]Wait, hold on.
[125:31.70]Sell, give two friends one, one.
[125:33.44]Alright, we're gonna buy the sheep, we're gonna do the fish.
[125:38.88]This would be really good.
[125:43.67]Squirrel.
[125:44.27]Buy, clear and fill, she clears everything and fills the shop with food.
[125:51.65]Interesting.
[125:52.01]Okay.
[125:52.87]Alright.
[125:56.63]So now that, okay.
[125:59.30]Now that I have a second, like I can barely kind of explain to people like, what is even going on?
[126:02.88]I have no idea.
[126:04.82]So this game is kind of like auto chess or like Hearthstone Battlegrounds or whatever other auto battler.
[126:12.61]You have a set of 10 gold at the end of the beginning of every round.
[126:17.24]Which, everything costs 3 gold.
[126:20.04]So, it's 3 gold for me to buy this.
[126:23.32]I get 10 gold every round.
[126:26.88]And your goal is to try to, they all have little things, they're like little perks.
[126:31.88]And little, if this, then Y. If X, then Y.
[126:35.83]And you have to try to build up a team eventually that's strong enough to take you to the end.
[126:42.34]They fight on their own, just by in order.
[126:44.96]One, two, three, four, five.
[126:46.10]You can only have five.
[126:47.86]And there's no undo, and you're playing against other players.
[126:51.44]Is this like teamfight tactics?
[126:53.75]I've never played teamfight tactics, but I'm going to say yes.
[126:56.89]I would say yes.
[126:58.83]It's like a Starcraft custom map.
[127:01.19]Yes.
[127:01.79]But I don't know if I should buy the squirrel.
[127:03.41]Is it time to buy a squirrel and just feed somebody?
[127:06.37]I don't think so.
[127:08.59]What about the peacock?
[127:15.81]Hope you're doing great.
[127:16.61]I'm doing pretty good.
[127:17.35]I am.
[127:20.62]I think I just re-roll the whole thing.
[127:28.00]Alright.
[127:29.05]Now we're talking.
[127:31.01]Now we're talking.
[127:31.69]Now we got some synergy.
[127:33.68]So the whale swallows something at the beginning of battle, which is technically killing it.
[127:39.81]And then after the whale dies, it spits it out and it gets to come back as a level one.
[127:44.81]So look at that.
[127:45.71]We have a sheep.
[127:47.25]It's going to eat the sheep and summon two rams.
[127:50.72]And then when the whale dies, it gets to happen again.
[127:53.94]Now we need somebody.
[127:54.88]We need the dog.
[127:55.50]Alright.
[127:56.82]This whole thing has to be redone.
[128:00.39]This whole thing.
[128:02.85]So, I need to get rid of everybody, pretty much.
[128:06.90]Let's get rid of the beaver.
[128:07.68]I got to do this in the right order.
[128:12.44]So, fish can go.
[128:14.42]Fish, can I buy everybody with the... Let's see, this is two gold, four, five, six.
[128:18.00]Okay, I can afford both.
[128:18.90]I think the fish has... If the fish goes...
[128:30.54]Which then allows me to get the... Alright, I have to buy the dog first.
[128:35.43]So maybe the swan?
[128:36.47]Replace the swan or replace the otter?
[128:50.68]Because the beaver... I mean, 5-5 versus 6-6.
[128:55.98]Get rid of the otter first.
[128:58.33]Yeah, because then I'm going to do... Okay, we'll get rid of the otter.
[129:02.85]Now the dog goes up.
[129:05.97]Okay, and now the whale comes up, which will get a benefit from the dog.
[129:10.43]There we go.
[129:18.38]So I have to make sure this is going to... So I have to do this, right?
[129:21.84]Okay.
[129:23.60]Because technically you can only have five people up.
[129:26.08]So I don't want to have it just be wasted.
[129:31.06]Oh, wait a minute.
[129:32.10]Fuck.
[129:33.10]Um.
[129:35.44]Oh, wait.
[129:35.86]This is wrong.
[129:36.66]This is wrong.
[129:41.02]He does it at the start of the fight.
[129:43.48]So he's going to just spit out a 2-2 ram.
[129:45.51]Oh.
[129:50.01]Oh, well.
[129:52.75]I think it's still going to be alright.
[129:55.77]Okay.
[129:56.07]Well, we'll do it like this.
[129:58.11]Dog is going to start getting buffed.
[130:11.18]Okay.
[130:11.84]Well, we'll see how it goes.
[130:14.96]Still greater in the numbers game.
[130:16.12]That's true.
[130:17.44]This game's really fun.
[130:18.30]I'm probably not going to play this that much on stream, but it's...
[130:21.91]When I saw Ludwig play this, I was like, that looks cute.
[130:23.55]Alright, so there it is.
[130:27.77]He's going to get the buff.
[130:28.93]Yep.
[130:30.91]Okay.
[130:38.06]Where's my second?
[130:38.72]Oh, okay.
[130:39.02]I was like, what?
[130:39.60]There we go.
[130:43.22]The dog is just a huge pain in the ass if you have summons.
[130:45.38]But I didn't make it.
[130:51.14]Do you know how you can speed it up?
[130:52.00]Yeah, but I like to watch.
[130:57.48]Another swan.
[131:01.90]I could put this guy behind.
[131:03.26]Honey on the dog.
[131:18.92]Might be time to sell a beaver.
[131:23.99]Alright, I think I'm going to sell beaver.
[131:26.95]Upgrade swan.
[131:29.20]Sneeze directly into the microphone.
[131:38.78]After that, probably... Should I even freeze the turtle?
[131:46.97]Well, I know I'm doing this, but I don't want to... Hold on.
[131:50.21]Let's do this first.
[131:53.42]Because the dog gets a benefit from this, so it has to be on the swan, maybe?
[131:57.56]Yeah.
[132:05.87]Okay, good.
[132:08.29]Now.
[132:12.93]This can really start to stack up, especially behind here, or behind him.
[132:18.13]Ox behind whale.
[132:20.24]Because anytime somebody ahead of the ox dies, he gets a divine shield and two attack.
[132:25.32]I feel like that's really good.
[132:32.29]Or should I not do that and try to find more summons?
[132:37.77]It only applies to the person directly in front of them.
[132:40.29]Oh, that's right.
[132:46.12]Swan will... Hmm.
[132:49.80]Hmm.
[132:51.04]I think behind here.
[132:51.80]I'm gonna, let me, hold on.
[132:57.36]Let me see if there's anything else.
[132:58.29]Oh, I know I'm doing this.
[133:02.51]Just a constant stream of money, especially if it's two gold around.
[133:04.93]That's a big deal.
[133:07.53]Let me freeze this.
[133:08.69]Let's just go for something else.
[133:11.35]Okay.
[133:13.67]I don't know if I even want the turtle.
[133:18.92]Ox and salad.
[133:19.84]Yeah, it's too late.
[133:31.80]Let's try this.
[133:32.18]Let's see if this works.
[133:40.10]Remember, it hates Elden Ring.
[133:43.82]I was going to just go off on a fake elaborate story of why I think it's the worst Souls game, but why would I do that?
[134:00.71]Okay, here we go.
[134:02.24]This is where this makes sense here.
[134:04.68]He dies, so he's going to get the buff.
[134:08.40]This sheep dies.
[134:09.74]Two sheep come out.
[134:11.32]Perfect.
[134:14.62]Yeah, alright.
[134:15.50]This is going to work out as long as I level them up and beef them up a little bit.
[134:20.62]I think he might have better stuff though.
[134:25.95]I'll kill the first two.
[134:28.05]No, this is a win.
[134:29.49]Shit, no it's not.
[134:30.49]Damn it, come on.
[134:32.62]He had garlic armor on.
[134:33.94]No, it's still a draw.
[134:48.04]Ooh, monkey is so good.
[134:53.99]Give the rightmost friend 2-2 every time you, and every time you, like, go to a battle.
[135:03.56]I think it's time to get rid of the... I don't know.
[135:08.20]Who does this replace?
[135:13.09]The dog?
[135:15.43]The dog's kind of fallen off.
[135:16.81]Or the swan, maybe.
[135:17.57]Okay.
[135:24.01]What does the 1-4 do?
[135:24.93]So every time the character directly in front of the Ox, when it dies, he gets plus 2 attack and Melon Armor, which means you can take at least 20 damage one time.
[135:37.43]It's like a shield.
[135:38.01]It's like Divine Shield.
[135:44.61]I need to buff this guy.
[135:46.47]Alright, let's see.
[135:47.01]Okay, we're going to make a decision based on this.
[135:48.59]Alright, nice.
[135:51.31]That's exactly what I wanted.
[135:54.99]I think it's time to get rid of this one.
[136:03.78]Yeah.
[136:14.16]Good.
[136:14.98]Okay.
[136:16.24]Okay, now I need garlic armor or something.
[136:21.89]Oop.
[136:27.41]Ooh.
[136:28.63]Ooh, here we go.
[136:29.15]Okay.
[136:31.27]The hippo is actually really good.
[136:33.49]If you kill somebody with the hippo, you just get 2-2.
[136:35.15]You just keep doing over and over and over and over and over again.
[136:42.16]Monkey buff's gonna get wasted on the sheep.
[136:46.34]Should I have the monkey just give it to himself?
[136:55.71]Because I want the hippo eventually to be here.
[137:05.28]I think we... I think I'm actually just probably going to get rid of the sheep.
[137:09.10]And the dog, maybe.
[137:17.82]Um, well, let's just roll.
[137:22.04]Yeah, I mean, the dog is good.
[137:25.67]It's the ox for the hippo.
[137:27.05]Yeah, that's probably the play.
[137:28.11]We'll do that next time.
[137:40.54]Because I want the monkey to buff the hippo.
[137:42.18]Oh my god, I'm going to lose.
[137:43.08]Holy fucking shit, are you kidding me?
[137:56.87]This is a disaster.
[138:06.94]What episode of the Let's Play is this?
[138:08.20]I don't know, 200?
[138:19.05]What's the title mean?
[138:22.11]Um, what does it say?
[138:23.27]Oh, free space bingo perspective?
[138:25.37]Yeah, but that means I'm the free space.
[138:27.29]Whoever is playing against me in the tournament, I'm the free space.
[138:31.33]Like, you're just pretty much guaranteed to win.
[138:33.02]Alright, let me get this right.
[138:35.94]We're going dog.
[138:38.86]I'm keeping the dog.
[138:40.06]Getting rid of the ox.
[138:43.64]Right?
[138:44.06]Yes?
[138:44.66]Yes.
[138:45.18]Get rid of the ox.
[138:47.78]Hippo, going in front.
[138:52.05]And then we're going to garlic the hippo.
[139:00.59]And then we're going to go like this.
[139:06.72]And that's a leveled up dog.
[139:08.58]Next round.
[139:09.86]Oh wait, I have to live.
[139:10.56]I actually have to survive, otherwise it's over.
[139:12.90]Why are you commentating like it's a grand strategy?
[139:22.08]You know what?
[139:23.70]I'm a nice guy.
[139:26.04]I'm a nice person.
[139:28.64]But when somebody comes in here, and I'm a good guy, right?
[139:32.30]I'm a nice guy.
[139:34.08]But if you come in and just kind of talk shit to me, nice guy drops.
[139:38.88]And then you watch out.
[139:40.45]Here comes the mad guy.
[139:41.35]Here comes, you know what I mean?
[139:42.79]Like, I'm a good guy.
[139:43.57]I'm a nice guy.
[139:54.94]Do I want to save anything else?
[139:55.76]No, roll.
[139:58.80]Alright, come on.
[139:59.30]Please survive this round.
[140:00.54]Come on, hippo.
[140:01.36]Please survive.
[140:02.16]I don't think the hippo is going to survive.
[140:06.89]Maybe because of the 2-2.
[140:07.87]This is going to take off if I live the next round.
[140:16.69]Okay, come on.
[140:17.19]Let's go.
[140:24.38]Don't get on my bad side.
[140:26.04]Yeah, look, chat.
[140:27.44]I'm a nice guy.
[140:29.42]But don't, like, you know, you get me riled up and you get me pissed off.
[140:32.16]Like, you know, don't get me fucking mad and everything.
[140:34.36]You know what I mean?
[140:34.78]I'm a nice guy.
[140:35.18]I'm nice to people.
[140:36.42]I'm not a fucking dick.
[140:37.34]I'm not a bad guy.
[140:38.06]I'm a nice person.
[140:38.80]I actually might survive.
[140:45.69]Oy.
[140:48.71]No.
[140:50.13]Come on.
[140:56.38]He's got a 2116 dog.
[140:59.11]Dog's level 2.
[141:00.03]God damn it.
[141:03.49]Oh well.
[141:13.24]No, I'm a nice person.
[141:14.96]Okay?
[141:15.84]I do nice things for people.
[141:27.60]It's like, okay.
[141:29.30]Alright, so what's your point?
[141:31.93]What are you talking about?
[141:42.60]You're doing an extended bit here.
[141:44.04]This is not a bit.
[141:49.78]Alright, parasocial Andy, don't let it get under your skin.
[141:52.78]How dare you.
[141:54.64]How dare you say something like that to me.
[141:58.98]You're lucky I'm a fucking nice guy, okay?
[142:02.47]How did I lose the first round?
[142:03.97]What?
[142:04.21]Hmm.
[142:23.62]Oh, god damn it.
[142:24.78]I need... Okay.
[142:28.32]I'm being a weirdo.
[142:35.73]This should work.
[142:41.15]Do I level up one of these two or do I just feed someone?
[142:44.42]Probably just level up the beaver.
[142:47.74]Let's go.
[143:05.74]Come on.
[143:07.38]No!
[143:09.88]I think I still, yeah, I still got it.
[143:19.07]Are you this bad?
[143:19.65]I just won the, I just won the match.
[143:23.48]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[143:29.24]No, I don't want the dog.
[143:34.20]Do I kill ant?
[143:36.70]Maybe.
[143:37.00]Oh, God.
[143:43.08]Okay.
[143:44.56]So, the play here is... I'm gonna make a level 3 ant.
[143:50.11]Sell this ant.
[143:52.95]Like, just get the... Okay, let's combine the ant.
[143:57.39]One of them.
[143:59.83]Get another one.
[144:03.75]Ooh, yeah.
[144:04.93]Alright.
[144:05.71]That's really good.
[144:08.80]Play kangaroo, kill ant.
[144:12.20]Or play kangaroo, kill ant next turn.
[144:15.04]And give food to kangaroo.
[144:26.11]Hmm.
[144:34.23]Yeah, I'll do it next turn.
[144:39.95]No!
[144:40.45]No!
[144:41.71]No!
[144:42.15]I wanted to move him.
[144:43.23]I wanted to move him to the front.
[144:45.91]I wanted to move him to the front.
[144:53.46]Whatever.
[144:54.50]Come on.
[144:55.02]I was trying to move him.
[145:01.64]I think I'm alright.
[145:08.40]That's a crock of shit right there if I've ever seen one.
[145:20.60]Oh, my God.
[145:21.32]He got melon armor.
[145:25.08]I just made you win unironically.
[145:29.72]Oh, look.
[145:30.06]It doesn't even matter because I can just buy this and kill it.
[145:34.21]We're not doing that right now, though.
[145:35.41]Hold on.
[145:41.50]Ah.
[145:43.44]Interesting.
[145:46.94]Come on.
[145:47.70]The worst one.
[145:48.58]The worst tier 3 pet that you could have given me.
[145:52.14]The worst one.
[145:52.96]Okay, alright.
[145:55.74]I'm a nice guy.
[145:57.47]But when I see shit like this that I don't like, it really, it gets me fucking a little pissed off.
[146:02.05]And it makes me, I'll talk about it for a little while.
[146:04.89]I hate to say this kind of shit to somebody that, like, I like to call myself, like, a good person.
[146:19.43]Everybody hates me.
[146:23.25]No, these suck.
[146:24.85]I can't use the dog right now.
[146:34.16]Oh, listen.
[146:34.70]He's a nice guy.
[146:35.72]There we go.
[146:37.46]Dodo.
[146:38.61]Freeze.
[146:41.63]Nice guys can get pissed off too.
[146:42.95]Relax.
[146:43.09]Relax.
[146:49.16]Because of boomer rant?
[146:52.32]What?
[146:54.64]The dodo, guys, I'm gonna sell the beaver and the dodo is gonna get extra points.
[147:01.69]That's a swan meadow, look at that.
[147:03.91]Wow.
[147:06.13]I don't even know how you did this.
[147:10.12]Like, how?
[147:18.39]I think that's when it is.
[147:31.14]Hmm... Okay, if I sell... Oh, shit.
[147:35.60]Okay, it's random friends up here.
[147:39.14]Alright, this is where we do the thing that I wanted to do.
[147:41.34]We're gonna sell... We're gonna kill the ant.
[147:45.04]Give it to the kangaroo.
[147:45.72]Ayyyyyy.
[147:55.99]Mosquito's worthless now, too.
[147:57.21]Alright, who do I replace?
[147:58.19]I know I gotta buff up the Dodo, so we're definitely gonna buy the Dodo.
[148:03.93]And I'm just gonna do this, too.
[148:06.14]Wait, no, hold on.
[148:08.58]Get rid of the Mosquito for... Maybe even the Beaver.
[148:16.82]The Giraffe will buff the Dodo.
[148:18.40]Okay, let's do that.
[148:24.09]The giraffe is going to buff the dodo, who in turn is going to buff the kangaroo, who in turn is going to... Alright, that's fine.
[148:34.64]I think everyone needs to move up a little bit, though.
[148:35.98]Like that.
[148:40.64]End turn, give one start of battle, give a... Okay.
[148:46.93]And I'm going to do this.
[148:50.66]That's what I would like to call a PogChamp, but if I don't see at least 500 PogChamps in the chat right now, I'm gonna scream as loud as I fucking can.
[148:59.47]Sell the fucking beaver.
[149:00.59]Next round.
[149:10.77]Boom.
[149:11.97]Boom.
[149:15.37]Oh, this person has a background.
[149:16.27]I know what they're doing.
[149:25.00]Alright, come on.
[149:28.40]Not bad so far.
[149:29.28]The dog is really scary.
[149:32.02]I'll make it to the dog.
[149:35.30]Alright, we're good.
[149:43.61]Very nice.
[149:45.53]Okay, I gotta do this in the right order.
[149:46.85]Sell the beaver.
[149:50.63]Don't sell the beaver yet because I need to give garlic to the kangaroo.
[149:58.64]And that means now I can sell the beaver.
[150:02.28]Which will give two health to two people.
[150:06.68]I'm really hoping it hits the kangaroo.
[150:14.63]That's perfect.
[150:15.23]That's almost precisely what I wanted.
[150:18.75]Rabbit now, if a friend eats a shop food, do they get plus one health?
[150:24.87]Hmm.
[150:27.63]I wonder.
[150:29.24]That's probably good.
[150:29.82]I need to feed somebody something.
[150:34.31]I'm going to feed the dodo the garlic, and that should be plus one health as well.
[150:40.17]Let me try to get some... I have to do this because it's a sure thing.
[150:54.10]Okay, good.
[150:54.96]Freeze that.
[150:59.04]Get another roll.
[151:01.38]That's another bunny.
[151:02.72]And I'm gonna freeze the snail, too, because if you lose, if I lose the next battle, then I just have to put him up there, and he gives 2-1 to everybody, and then you just sell him.
[151:11.57]Alright.
[151:12.03]This is looking good.
[151:12.55]Alright, let's go.
[151:15.13]I think this should be alright.
[151:15.85]Is this the guy that wore the Snuggie?
[151:25.40]No.
[151:26.88]This is a loss, probably.
[151:27.76]We'll see.
[151:30.13]Garlic armor is on the crabs.
[151:36.36]Although, I think the kangaroo is going to carry.
[151:39.04]Yep, that's a kangaroo carry right there.
[151:40.82]Bingo.
[151:42.75]Do I have enough to kill the next two?
[151:45.05]Yep.
[151:48.29]Oh, shit.
[151:49.41]That was actually closer than it could have... Oh, wow.
[152:00.87]I won that, so unfortunately... I'm going to hold on to the snail, though.
[152:11.62]Give me another bunny.
[152:14.22]Okay, so if somebody eats food, they get plus one.
[152:16.46]So this is just going to give them two people plus one, plus one.
[152:19.38]So it's going to be just doubled up on the health.
[152:23.30]Oh.
[152:23.92]Oh my god, couldn't have been better than that.
[152:25.44]You could not have even given me a better one.
[152:30.35]What do you think?
[152:30.79]Should I just get the ant?
[152:32.27]Level up the ant?
[152:33.97]What's my favorite soda?
[152:34.93]It varies.
[152:35.69]Seven up.
[152:43.79]And then... Go ahead and roll it.
[152:46.14]Alright, so in case I lose, I have an opportunity here.
[152:50.52]So I think this is going to start to stack.
[152:56.10]Oh, the dodo.
[152:57.16]Why would I do that?
[153:01.23]That's a level 3 ant, which is awesome.
[153:04.61]Let's go.
[153:13.86]Watching any new shows?
[153:15.08]Not really.
[153:21.46]Not really.
[153:23.32]Give it to the kangaroo.
[153:25.27]Ah, it's alright.
[153:26.27]Spread it out a little bit.
[153:28.55]This is bad.
[153:30.97]That's a loss.
[153:38.19]That's okay.
[153:39.27]That's fine.
[153:41.56]I got a big... Oh, yeah.
[153:43.02]This is a big play here.
[153:45.08]So, I lost.
[153:46.86]Let me think this through.
[153:48.94]Okay, hear me out for a second.
[153:50.78]What if I get the ant to level 3, kill the ant, do the snail, and then give food to kangaroo?
[154:05.27]What do you think?
[154:06.75]Sell the giraffe first?
[154:11.75]Do not do the snail.
[154:13.95]Sell the giraffe.
[154:14.53]Alright, well, I know for a fact I'm gonna do this at least.
[154:21.40]Like, this is a fact.
[154:27.30]I want him to have more health.
[154:30.96]So now sell the giraffe.
[154:37.86]Okay, sell giraffe.
[154:41.05]And... Put the ant up here.
[154:44.71]And then put the snail up there.
[154:47.17]Well, let's see what we get for the triple.
[154:53.49]That's a fucking Thanksgiving turkey.
[154:55.69]That's too bad that I don't have anything to summon.
[154:57.79]Otherwise... Because this is one of the best... This is one of the best cards in the game.
[155:03.38]And I'm saying that because all I play is Hearthstone.
[155:04.84]It's the only thing I know.
[155:08.66]There's one here, I know, but I'd have to throw away this whole party, and I like what's going on right now.
[155:17.61]So what's more valuable?
[155:19.55]Giving everybody right now on this whole team 2-1?
[155:22.91]Everyone?
[155:24.55]Or throw away the rabbit, get the turkey and the sheep?
[155:34.98]I think snail.
[155:35.80]I think it's snail.
[155:45.43]And then I can sell the snail.
[155:48.85]And put the sheep up.
[155:53.25]Or should I do the deer?
[155:53.91]Put the turkey up.
[156:06.92]I think I like that.
[156:07.50]Yeah, because the bus has splash damage.
[156:12.03]Alright, so now...
[156:14.40]Did the ant go first?
[156:15.34]Because the ant could give the 6-3 to the deer.
[156:25.26]No.
[156:25.86]Alright.
[156:28.22]Now this is a big deal.
[156:29.80]Because he's going to give him 7 attack.
[156:31.46]This is huge.
[156:32.44]The dodo is huge.
[156:36.96]Alright.
[156:37.18]What's it going to go?
[156:39.70]I freeze these both.
[156:41.98]I don't think I'm doing the summon thing right now.
[156:46.72]I'll think about it.
[156:50.74]Is this game actually fun?
[156:51.73]Yeah.
[156:52.27]This is not like sponsored or anything.
[156:53.67]Ludwig just said he was wondering if I wanted just to play in the tournament.
[156:58.03]I was like, sure, why not?
[157:00.25]This is a big deal because he's going to knock this armor off.
[157:03.02]This is huge.
[157:05.74]That's a huge deal.
[157:11.38]Now we need the kangaroo to carry.
[157:19.09]Good.
[157:20.37]Alright, this is a win.
[157:27.95]You ever gonna play this again after this stream?
[157:32.00]I mean... I don't know.
[157:37.12]Oh shit, alright, it's decision time.
[157:40.90]Is it time to sell the ant, give somebody a 6-3 permanently, hopefully not the bunny?
[157:53.12]Okay, do I sell bunny first, put turkey up, get rid of ant?
[158:05.91]Unfortunately, I can't go over 10 gold, can I?
[158:10.29]Oh, you can go over 10.
[158:11.77]I thought you couldn't go over 10 unless, uh, okay.
[158:16.16]Alright, turkey goes up.
[158:20.07]Oh, the ant?
[158:20.95]Alright, I need something good here.
[158:22.11]I want this to go on the kangaroo so bad.
[158:27.09]Oh, oops.
[158:28.29]Right.
[158:28.89]I did that in the wrong order.
[158:29.65]You're right.
[158:31.05]Oh, no.
[158:31.49]Okay.
[158:31.81]Well, it's still a 1 out of 3.
[158:33.07]It was a 50-50.
[158:33.57]Fuck.
[158:34.23]It's alright.
[158:35.99]Um, shit.
[158:37.35]It's alright.
[158:38.31]Fuck.
[158:42.46]Yeah!
[158:43.98]Now we put the sheep up here.
[158:48.15]Now we're in business.
[158:49.40]We are in big business now.
[158:50.92]Because this is going to give... To anything summoned, that includes the car.
[159:02.14]So anybody that's summoned gets 3-3.
[159:04.29]This is going to be okay.
[159:07.59]I still have money.
[159:09.11]What do I want to do with my last bit of money?
[159:10.51]Let's see if this rolls.
[159:11.17]Alright.
[159:14.55]Alright.
[159:16.07]This is, okay, really, really good.
[159:19.63]Very good for me.
[159:21.19]I'm going to freeze.
[159:24.34]Do I just use the dodo now or use the food?
[159:32.48]Yeah, buy the dodo now.
[159:33.52]I'm going to hold on to these because I want to give it to, I don't know, maybe somebody.
[159:42.49]Alright, nice.
[159:43.15]Okay.
[159:43.93]Alright.
[159:45.53]Level the deer up.
[159:46.57]I don't think I'm doing the turtle.
[159:50.35]Oh.
[159:54.35]What does freezing do?
[159:55.01]Freezing means that you're guaranteeing that that will show up next turn.
[159:58.01]So it doesn't go away.
[159:59.41]It doesn't get rolled out.
[160:05.26]That is a monster back there.
[160:06.50]That kangaroo.
[160:09.02]Beautiful.
[160:10.54]Beautiful.
[160:11.78]More splash damage.
[160:12.52]Beautiful.
[160:13.82]Four.
[160:14.66]Beautiful.
[160:20.43]Oh shit, but this thing is murdering people.
[160:23.98]What was going on there?
[160:25.24]I still win.
[160:29.06]What the hell?
[160:30.32]That thing was doing so much damage.
[160:31.94]Is it on hurt?
[160:41.47]I can't do that.
[160:42.91]I guess I could.
[160:43.69]Is it time to get rid of the dodo?
[160:47.41]No.
[160:47.67]No.
[160:56.72]I'm really looking for another deer.
[160:58.24]Or another dodo.
[161:12.87]The sheep.
[161:14.87]Or the rooster.
[161:17.83]That's actually a pretty good play.
[161:23.08]Yep.
[161:25.89]Now we just use... Let me roll because I can do it.
[161:34.08]Copy ability from pet ahead as a level one until the... So this copies whatever the person in front does?
[161:38.88]Parrot could copy Dodo.
[161:46.44]So would that mean that the parrot would give the Dodo three attack?
[161:49.33]Yeah.
[161:53.11]Does the parrot copy the bus?
[161:55.40]The parrot would, yeah, the parrot would copy the deer.
[161:57.00]Parrot is trash?
[162:01.50]Well, I don't know.
[162:03.64]Copy the turkey.
[162:06.30]Oh, shit.
[162:08.24]Copy the turkey so then anything they could summon gets a 6-6.
[162:14.06]That's not bad.
[162:15.72]That's kind of cool.
[162:19.42]But what would I get rid of?
[162:22.36]I feel like everyone up here is way too important right now.
[162:24.95]It would be an 11-11 bus.
[162:29.75]I don't have space for it.
[162:30.65]I don't.
[162:40.92]Eat shop food.
[162:41.66]Give two random friends one one.
[162:43.12]Hmm.
[162:43.56]Hmm.
[162:51.73]Good.
[162:52.17]That's really good.
[162:55.19]I'm not going to give that to anybody else.
[162:56.57]Alright, come on.
[162:57.07]Let's go.
[162:57.35]How many vitamin gummies can you eat in one sitting?
[163:06.04]Why would you eat that many vitamin gummies?
[163:07.36]That's like bad for you.
[163:08.00]Alright, this is an instant kill.
[163:13.00]Thankfully, he's not going to be able to go through it.
[163:15.58]It's going to kill.
[163:16.10]Yeah, that's... Thank God.
[163:17.01]Thank God.
[163:20.85]This motherfucker, though.
[163:21.75]Die.
[163:24.49]Damn it.
[163:25.99]Oh, yes.
[163:26.75]The turkey saved it.
[163:29.89]Oh, shit.
[163:30.53]This is going to be rough.
[163:33.13]No.
[163:34.89]No.
[163:35.33]He's had so much... Damn it.
[163:45.50]Ayayay, this is where it gets weird.
[163:47.08]Alright.
[163:47.76]Gorilla, when it gets hurt, gains a coconut shield.
[163:50.78]Works one time per turn.
[163:53.13]It ignores all damage once.
[163:56.25]This is a snake.
[163:56.99]Okay, so when the person ahead of you attacks, deal five damage to a random person.
[164:11.61]These two seem like a no-brainer, but I don't know which one's better.
[164:15.41]Behind the... I feel like it would be better behind somebody that can... Probably the kangaroo, right?
[164:28.18]Because the kangaroo is going to be able to swing the most amount of times.
[164:38.57]Put the dodo on the rooster now.
[164:41.00]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[164:41.96]Or I could use the deer, but... Alright, hold on.
[164:51.60]Let's do this.
[164:52.82]If I find chocolate, then the deer is going to stay.
[164:57.45]I need to try it real once.
[165:08.12]Ah, fuck that splash damage.
[165:09.54]That's good.
[165:11.36]I feel like somebody should have this.
[165:21.28]Food with health and attack effects are doubled.
[165:27.20]Flash on the kangaroo.
[165:28.20]That's probably the play, but that would get rid of the garlic armor.
[165:36.23]I'm going to roll one more time.
[165:42.79]Give it to the deer?
[165:43.47]Yeah, because it's always 5 damage, so it's going to do 5 splash regardless.
[165:50.26]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[165:52.02]Let's do another roll.
[165:57.14]What the hell?
[165:58.86]Fly.
[165:59.00]When a friend faints, summon a 2-2 fly in its place?
[166:07.08]I feel like that would be better than the turkey.
[166:15.67]No, I see like the tier six and I go better.
[166:21.77]Turkey and the fly.
[166:24.04]So is it time to get rid of the dodo or the rooster?
[166:34.00]Turkey and fly is big, big, big.
[166:38.88]Dodo sucks.
[166:39.44]Dodo or kangaroo.
[166:40.62]But this is the only reason why I can even hurt anything right at this stage.
[166:45.82]I think sell Dodo, but that's a hard call.
[166:47.70]Yeah, I don't know.
[166:51.52]Yeah, alright.
[166:52.62]We're going to replace Dodo with a fly.
[166:54.00]And then, hold on.
[167:07.28]I have another rooster.
[167:08.28]Fly, rooster.
[167:12.12]So I'm going to 2-2 fly in its place.
[167:17.86]okay I ruined it how okay so I'm gonna do yeah okay now but there's not enough room uh does the kangaroo need to go first
[167:46.21]Because this is going to summon a bus.
[167:51.97]And it's not going to be able to summon the 2-2 fly.
[167:55.05]So I feel like this needs to be first because this has to die.
[167:59.27]Then there's enough room for all the summons.
[168:02.96]Is that wrong?
[168:07.92]No?
[168:09.94]Yeah, isn't that correct?
[168:14.45]It's fine.
[168:15.05]You just miss one fly.
[168:16.35]Perky won't buff it.
[168:19.63]Huh.
[168:23.59]Don't put Kangaroo first.
[168:24.45]It will not use its ability.
[168:25.51]Yeah, okay.
[168:28.61]That's true.
[168:29.21]Well, let's just see how this goes.
[168:35.31]Maybe like this?
[168:38.25]I think that's the play.
[168:45.51]Alright, let's go.
[168:50.51]I'm just imagining it won't summon all the flies.
[168:55.60]Well, we lost anyways.
[168:57.42]I don't think we're getting through this one.
[169:04.14]Maybe.
[169:04.56]That's so good, but it's too late.
[169:11.89]It's too late.
[169:15.96]Is it too late?
[169:16.98]Maybe... No, maybe not.
[169:21.02]I think this might be... No, it's not.
[169:22.54]This might be a win.
[169:25.75]Is it?
[169:26.05]I can't tell.
[169:26.53]21-10.
[169:28.39]This is a win.
[169:30.85]Holy shit.
[169:41.62]Alright, well that's really good.
[169:47.19]I need to level up one of these guys.
[169:49.27]Especially the fly.
[169:50.37]Or the turkey.
[169:54.27]Scorpion is so good though.
[169:55.27]It's an instant kill.
[169:56.07]It kills anything in one hit.
[170:00.92]Do I stick with the plan and just keep this team going and try to buff this team?
[170:07.34]Or do I replace somebody with the instant kill scorpion?
[170:11.34]Just stick with it?
[170:13.39]What about the food?
[170:14.25]The canned food is usually really good, right?
[170:18.89]Or are we just skipping everything and just trying to buff these guys only?
[170:28.93]Buff, buff, buff.
[170:30.27]Just only roll for food and buff this team.
[170:32.08]Food.
[170:34.24]Buff only the current team.
[170:35.42]Alright, let's go.
[170:41.36]Oh, that's cheese pizza.
[170:43.16]Okay, if the cheese pizza goes to... Oh, that's a cheese pizza.
[170:51.98]Bingo.
[170:52.88]Exactly who I wanted it on.
[170:56.76]Give me another rooster.
[170:58.14]Or another deer.
[170:58.82]Come on.
[170:59.60]Or two turkeys.
[171:00.62]I want two turkeys.
[171:09.32]Fuck.
[171:11.16]Give other level two and three friends one one.
[171:13.70]I don't have any.
[171:16.18]I guess I could just do this on the kangaroo.
[171:21.10]Let's hold that for a second.
[171:25.28]I can't sell anybody.
[171:26.10]We gotta run this to the end.
[171:29.67]Back for 20 more damage once.
[171:32.65]Oh, this shark.
[171:33.81]Friend faints 2-1.
[171:35.15]That's a lot of fainting.
[171:37.49]That's a lot of fainting.
[171:43.53]Put the stake on the deer.
[171:44.73]Oh, yeah.
[171:49.56]Is the shark a trap?
[171:52.16]Fly is better.
[171:53.38]Yeah, the fly I think might be actually better.
[171:55.02]Freeze the shark at least?
[171:58.66]Okay.
[171:59.69]Well, I can't lose.
[172:00.85]If I lose, it's over.
[172:11.37]Put the stake on the deer because it's a guaranteed more than 20 damage.
[172:16.61]I'm either going to do that or I'm going to do the 3-3 on the kangaroo.
[172:22.53]I can roll again, but do I... I think I need to save the steak.
[172:29.88]Let's roll.
[172:33.52]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[172:37.48]Why can this not be like a turn ago?
[172:39.68]Oh my god, this would be insane!
[172:42.56]Because that means he would be doing 4-4.
[172:51.23]Steak on the deer.
[172:52.25]Freeze everybody because the cow is crazy too, but I can't replace anybody.
[173:03.51]Alright, we're going steak in the front.
[173:06.62]I have to play for the win, right?
[173:07.92]He'll kill the first thing.
[173:10.90]Next round, we get a level... Okay, here we go.
[173:15.94]I should freeze the cow because then I could sell...
[173:23.07]Shark better than kangaroo?
[173:24.19]I don't know.
[173:24.51]Not at this stage.
[173:25.85]Especially if I can get him to like a 30-30.
[173:27.63]Yeah, no, no.
[173:31.88]I'm sticking with the plan.
[173:33.18]If we live, we live.
[173:34.90]I'm going.
[173:35.28]Let's go.
[173:42.40]There's nobody I can really replace.
[173:45.83]The dog is terrifying, but I think... Oh, man.
[173:49.97]Okay, hold on.
[173:50.47]Alright, what do we got?
[173:55.63]That dog is terrifying, but I should be alright.
[173:58.49]I think I'm gonna be okay.
[173:59.29]21.
[173:59.31]2.
[173:59.33]18.
[174:03.23]Alright.
[174:03.45]Come on!
[174:06.17]Come on!
[174:08.69]No!
[174:08.89]Damn it!
[174:10.01]No!
[174:12.80]He was just too strong.
[174:24.45]He's just had too much attack and too much health.
[174:27.72]Oh, well.
[174:31.86]Double monkey.
[174:33.56]I'm not sure I was going to get over that one.
[174:35.06]Damn it.
[174:39.21]That kangaroo pull couldn't happen last turn.
[174:47.98]Oh, well.
[174:49.44]That's fun.
[174:49.94]This game's fun.
[174:54.59]Alright, we're going beaver.
[174:57.37]Cricket.
[175:01.11]I mean, the horse sucks, but... I can just sell him.
[175:05.47]Or should I just roll?
[175:10.55]Cricket sucks too.
[175:11.23]The horse is worse.
[175:15.95]Just to go for the stats?
[175:16.91]Mosquito?
[175:18.21]Yeah.
[175:31.43]Try to get ant?
[175:31.97]Yeah.
[175:34.09]I think ant's the best tier one person.
[175:43.29]This is just a trade, so it's... Oh, no, it's not.
[175:46.31]Oh, no, this is a loss.
[175:47.11]Remember the timer?
[175:53.02]It's been two hours since you said 30 minutes.
[175:56.36]Yeah, but what else am I doing right now?
[175:57.42]I'm fine.
[176:02.77]Um, fuck it.
[176:13.78]It has more stats right now, but it summons the one one rat for the other team.
[176:17.96]You know, yeah, let's just go for it.
[176:25.14]Cricket first?
[176:26.94]Or no, he should probably be first.
[176:32.79]Didn't you say this is going to be like 31 minutes?
[176:34.93]Yeah, I'm having fun though.
[176:39.45]Let the rat last.
[176:48.72]Nice.
[176:55.08]Will I last?
[176:56.14]I don't know.
[176:57.48]Because he has the most health.
[176:58.36]But I kind of want him to tank.
[177:03.50]Turns out it didn't matter.
[177:04.14]Alright.
[177:09.68]Well, that cricket upgrade seemed like now a good idea.
[177:11.65]Although this is going to be tricky.
[177:15.75]No, this is a loss.
[177:16.41]If you had to give us homework, don't remind him.
[177:23.54]Oh, they're reminding me to turn the stream off.
[177:27.70]Well, I'll be back on Sunday.
[177:29.96]This is just going to be a little thing just to kind of jump in and play around with them.
[177:33.82]The tournament.
[177:42.61]Alright, that looks good.
[177:43.47]That looks good too.
[177:48.31]I like the swan.
[177:49.95]I like the spider as well.
[177:52.91]Do a bug tier list.
[177:55.05]Every single bug at F. Honeybees at S. Praying mantis at S. A big stag beetle at A. And that's it.
[178:25.06]What about butterfly?
[178:25.76]Ah, B. A. Ah, A. What about a worm?
[178:30.56]A worm's not a bug.
[178:40.81]A worm is a bug?
[178:47.11]Worm is... No, that doesn't classify as an insecto, whatever they're called.
[178:53.05]A worm is a bug?
[178:53.89]I thought a worm was something else.
[178:59.03]It's not an insect.
[178:59.97]Yeah, I thought- it's not an insect.
[179:04.89]Is it- okay.
[179:05.37]Worm?
[179:05.99]Bug?
[179:10.12]Isn't it like a nematode or something?
[179:11.68]No, worms are not insects.
[179:14.74]Both worms and insects are classified under the kingdom Anemalia?
[179:19.90]Vertebrae, animals with backbone.
[179:22.35]And invertebrae, animals without a backbone.
[179:24.21]Are worms insects or animals?
[179:26.03]Are worms considered a bug?
[179:33.12]What is it?
[179:34.00]No.
[179:38.06]It's not a bug.
[179:40.24]It's like an invertebrate worm thing.
[179:49.75]They're like nematodes or something.
[179:59.71]Okay, although they are indeed invertebrate insects, worms definitely are not insects.
[180:06.36]Even segmented worms are not classified as an insect.
[180:10.54]They're just called an invertebrate worm.
[180:16.76]Okay, well, there's a post on MMO Champion from like 10 years ago.
[180:23.03]Somebody please settle a debate with me.
[180:24.59]Are worms bugs?
[180:28.72]It looks like this has been a battle for a century.
[180:35.63]I disagree.
[180:35.97]I don't think the worms are bugs.
[180:38.11]They're like an inanimate... Not inanimate object.
[180:40.99]They're an invertebrate object.
[180:43.05]Whoa!
[180:45.53]Okay.
[180:46.29]I'm going to sell the beaver.
[180:55.03]I didn't want it to go on either one of these two.
[180:56.87]Not really.
[181:01.22]But, you know, we kind of have to do this now.
[181:11.25]Hmm.
[181:17.40]Alright.
[181:19.88]What does a level 2 rat do?
[181:23.14]Does it just get rid of the dirty 1-1 rats?
[181:32.51]I don't think I really want the spider.
[181:33.75]Let's just get something else.
[181:35.65]Oh boy, oh boy.
[181:37.73]Well, okay.
[181:38.21]I'm going to kill that next turn.
[181:47.58]Forget about the dog.
[181:59.47]Why isn't the rat last?
[182:03.97]So it summons a 1-1 for your opponent that betrays them.
[182:07.50]What does that even mean?
[182:08.28]Friend ahead deal... So you deal one damage to the friend ahead?
[182:15.07]What?
[182:37.38]Alright.
[182:39.44]Um, well, let's do this.
[182:46.25]Okay.
[182:48.49]Alright.
[182:49.25]It's time to get rid of the ant and the mosquito.
[182:58.06]Or should I roll for a level 2 ant?
[183:01.50]Let's get rid of the mosquito.
[183:05.00]Put up the penguin.
[183:10.40]Wait, let me get this in the right order.
[183:12.46]Put up the penguin.
[183:13.52]Sell the ant.
[183:17.11]Sell the ant now, probably.
[183:18.71]Because I don't really want it to go on the penguin, do I?
[183:28.33]I'd rather it go on somebody else.
[183:30.19]Okay, that's fine.
[183:32.75]Get you up there.
[183:34.54]Upgrade the rat.
[183:36.80]No, not yet.
[183:37.44]Hold on.
[183:37.78]Let's do another roll.
[183:49.96]I just do two rats.
[183:51.20]Don't upgrade.
[183:51.78]Just have two rats.
[183:54.63]It's going to, I think, screw me over later.
[183:56.05]I can roll one more time.
[184:03.17]Get the sheep.
[184:05.55]I don't... Mm-mm.
[184:09.17]Mm-mm.
[184:27.81]I think I'm just going to do the rat.
[184:40.82]He's going to give 1-1 to everybody here.
[184:45.60]Worm is a worm.
[184:47.18]Alright.
[184:48.52]This is kind of a shitty team, but whatever.
[184:50.98]The rat is the worst unit in the game.
[184:56.72]Well, sorry.
[185:01.34]You want me to read that so bad.
[185:02.92]I've seen you write that twice, at least.
[185:06.98]You want me to say that so bad.
[185:08.80]I've seen you write that more than two times.
[185:11.91]I'm not going to read it.
[185:15.75]You wrote it ten times.
[185:17.09]Okay, well, whatever.
[185:19.21]Let's go.
[185:24.33]I feel like this is not that bad.
[185:25.43]I should be able to get through the first two with the cricket.
[185:34.57]Yeah, the first three with the cricket, actually.
[185:36.01]This is good.
[185:36.43]Because the cricket's a 2-2.
[185:38.81]Oh, never mind.
[185:45.68]Shit.
[185:47.32]Shit.
[185:49.76]Shit.
[185:51.44]Shit.
[185:53.96]Shit!
[185:58.14]No!
[185:59.04]They're gonna win!
[185:59.66]That's the worst unit in the game!
[186:10.29]I'm kind of stuck with the rat.
[186:30.17]Hmm.
[186:41.32]Look at his roll.
[186:47.57]That's good, but not really.
[186:49.05]Crab?
[186:51.25]Copy the health?
[186:52.56]Eh.
[186:56.92]Eh.
[186:58.40]Whale?
[186:58.86]Rat?
[186:59.12]Why would I do that?
[187:08.67]Oh, no.
[187:09.53]I mean, I could do rabbit salad bowl.
[187:19.66]Kill the rat.
[187:24.20]The whale behind the rat.
[187:25.14]Why would I do that?
[187:28.54]Ox and otter.
[187:33.50]I'm going rabbit salad.
[187:40.92]Just in case I get something good.
[187:41.94]Hold on.
[187:45.12]Not really.
[187:52.73]Actually really good that it hit those two.
[187:59.95]Hmm.
[188:05.44]I'll hold on to the dodo, maybe.
[188:06.96]Maybe.
[188:10.18]No, actually, it's probably too late for the dodo.
[188:13.82]Yeah, let's just go.
[188:24.93]Healing the rat would just give me a 1-1.
[188:26.41]I don't know how that even works.
[188:32.86]That's a wash, but he comes back.
[188:39.22]Uh, this is gonna be tough.
[188:44.85]Yeah, I'm in trouble.
[188:46.93]I just didn't scale that well.
[188:59.99]That's not bad.
[189:05.17]That's actually really pretty good.
[189:07.07]Deal 5 damage to the lowest enemy with the lowest health?
[189:09.63]I think it's Dolphin in the back.
[189:19.51]Or even in the front.
[189:25.56]Wait, Snail first.
[189:26.62]Wait.
[189:26.80]I think I want the Dolphin to get the buff from the Snail.
[189:32.90]Can I get rid of the Rabbit?
[189:34.60]Oh, what happened?
[189:35.66]No!
[189:40.16]I was trying... I, like, apparently had this selected and I clicked... What?
[189:55.39]Oh, fuck.
[189:56.43]Okay, well, whatever.
[189:57.35]Goodbye.
[189:57.77]That kinda sucks.
[190:28.68]Put him first.
[190:33.64]Because he only does that once.
[190:36.32]Elephant would be good.
[190:37.00]I don't have anybody that can benefit.
[190:45.43]Yeah, we'll put him first.
[190:48.35]Or rat first.
[190:51.79]Is this game free?
[190:52.43]This game is free.
[190:53.31]Oh, what?
[190:59.76]I believe this is $5 to buy, like, the extra animals.
[191:04.81]So, I believe this is free.
[191:07.97]That rat sucks, but I think I win this.
[191:14.40]It's not that good, actually.
[191:15.96]That kind of is really bad.
[191:17.08]It's not good.
[191:20.84]I just gave him free buffs to everybody.
[191:26.51]I think I still might win this, though.
[191:37.14]Only one win.
[191:38.14]Oh my god.
[191:38.96]Hmm.
[191:47.33]I know I gotta get rid of the bunny.
[191:48.45]Maybe the penguin too.
[191:51.57]Penguin's not doing anything right now.
[192:02.13]Crab behind rat is not bad.
[192:03.89]And then just feed the crab.
[192:10.66]Hippo is amazing as well.
[192:18.03]I think it's time to get rid of the penguin because the rabbit I can feed the hippo.
[192:26.49]And he'll get extra health from that.
[192:32.26]I think that's what I'm doing.
[192:44.15]Very good.
[192:44.59]Roll again.
[192:49.41]Really wanted something else besides these two.
[192:51.79]It could have been anything else.
[192:55.53]It could have been anything else but these two.
[192:59.52]But, I mean, I have to use it because he's going to get the health.
[193:13.71]Okay.
[193:18.19]I feel like I should put him behind, still put him behind.
[193:20.29]I don't think he has enough damage to kill anything.
[193:24.96]Well, I'm dead anyways, so let's go.
[193:30.13]This is a dead rat run.
[193:34.89]Oh, hold on.
[193:37.03]Hold on.
[193:41.13]Oh, that's good.
[193:44.23]What did he just kill?
[193:47.08]This is okay.
[193:47.62]I think this is alright.
[193:54.90]It is.
[193:56.26]We live another day.
[193:56.94]There's a bunny, yeah.
[194:02.74]14 damage, holy shit.
[194:16.93]Splash damage on... These are all good, but it's almost like I can't even do it.
[194:26.62]It's too late.
[194:29.47]The shark with all the bees.
[194:31.23]Yeah, it's okay.
[194:32.57]I got to get rid of the rabbit.
[194:34.41]And we're going to do shark and we're going to do bee on everybody.
[194:42.76]Yeah, I'm going to put bee on the dolphin.
[194:54.69]Bee on dolphin or bee on... Yeah.
[194:57.13]Yeah.
[195:00.76]Okay.
[195:02.74]Flash damage for... No, let's roll.
[195:07.96]This emote is vile.
[195:08.90]I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[195:14.61]You couldn't give me anything that could work with me here.
[195:19.95]I could just do roll again.
[195:30.14]7 damage to the last enemy?
[195:31.60]I could just be the cricket.
[195:37.45]Yeah.
[195:39.91]This is really like kind of a last ditch effort here.
[195:43.05]Let's just try to smoke this guy up.
[195:48.68]That's the best thing I got.
[195:49.62]Let's hope I don't lose.
[195:52.78]Are you streaming on a Tuesday?
[195:53.78]Uh, I wasn't planning on streaming.
[195:56.84]Uh, but I was like, you know what?
[195:58.18]Let's go.
[195:59.54]Because I was playing in the Ludwig's Autopets tournament.
[196:03.71]Which I did okay.
[196:05.67]I did alright.
[196:06.25]I came in last place.
[196:07.79]I lost every game I played in a row.
[196:10.25]Um, and I forgot the rules the first three matches.
[196:13.51]But it was not, it wasn't bad.
[196:14.63]It was okay.
[196:18.10]I think this actually might work out.
[196:19.46]The shark's gonna get just so fed.
[196:22.19]It really depends on what happens here.
[196:26.81]I think this is a win.
[196:29.77]Yeah.
[196:30.63]He's going to be too fed.
[196:34.75]B shark strategy seems to be pretty good.
[196:36.93]Here we go.
[196:41.69]Alright.
[196:42.23]He's got 11.
[196:43.03]He'll have... How much will he have?
[196:46.01]13.
[196:48.19]Oh, fuck.
[196:48.87]No.
[196:50.18]Never mind.
[196:50.72]It's over.
[196:53.16]Oh well.
[196:54.16]That was not very great.
[196:55.00]Alright.
[197:01.57]I have to pee again.
[197:02.57]What's wrong with me?
[197:04.29]Is he not in the tournament anymore?
[197:05.31]No, I lost.
[197:05.89]I'll play another one.
[197:07.97]I'll play one more.
[197:08.97]Maybe.
[197:09.49]We'll do one more.
[197:10.60]But I have to pee again because I don't know my body.
[197:12.36]I don't know what's wrong with me.
[197:14.86]I'll be right back.
[199:00.90]Thank you.
[200:19.98]Okay.
[200:20.98]One more.
[200:30.87]Oh, it's jebaited, but it's a turkey.
[200:32.83]Okay, I get it.
[200:38.03]I was trying- I thought it was- I thought it was a flying skull.
[200:43.28]With flames behind it.
[200:44.26]Oh, he was going really fast.
[200:45.28]I don't know.
[200:50.71]Okay, let's go back.
[200:51.33]Okay.
[201:03.81]Very nice.
[201:06.17]It is time to continue.
[201:07.31]Alright, last one.
[201:11.58]Oh, right off the bat, this is a great one.
[201:19.16]Alrighty, right off the bat.
[201:22.06]Beautiful.
[201:25.74]Oh, yuck.
[201:30.73]I didn't want to do that.
[201:39.42]I wanted to move him.
[201:40.50]Fuck, come on.
[201:43.56]Okay, it's... Oh, listen to me.
[201:46.42]It's right... You hold right click to move.
[201:49.84]You don't hold left click to move.
[201:51.12]Don't make the mistake I keep making.
[201:57.08]Shit.
[202:13.95]It's right click.
[202:15.53]It's okay.
[202:16.11]I think this is still a win.
[202:19.00]Or it's a draw?
[202:19.58]No, it's a win.
[202:20.50]Because my brain just wants to move.
[202:30.44]Like, move you this way, move you that way.
[202:31.58]But I gotta burn that in my brain.
[202:33.09]It's right click, right click, right click.
[202:37.37]I like the fish on low levels.
[202:42.89]Ooh.
[202:43.01]Ooh.
[202:45.57]Okay.
[202:52.34]Nice.
[202:57.04]I like it.
[202:58.54]Looks good.
[203:00.51]You have to pee?
[203:01.05]We just went pee.
[203:14.57]Go to the fish behind you.
[203:15.39]Nice.
[203:15.73]Perfect.
[203:17.09]I'll just clean the rest of this up.
[203:27.57]I have mine.
[203:27.94]Why are you saying we?
[203:29.58]Well, we as in collectively, we all went to the bathroom five minutes ago.
[203:33.76]Oh, beautiful.
[203:37.78]The game wants me to win.
[203:39.52]It actually really wants me to win.
[203:47.32]I mean, it's just good for now.
[203:51.78]Did you say giraffe?
[203:57.96]How come it doesn't say that for anybody else?
[203:59.42]That's the only person that does that.
[204:02.72]Did I bring that up earlier?
[204:03.66]That's weird.
[204:14.00]Nice.
[204:15.91]Nice.
[204:20.19]Oh.
[204:21.39]Nice.
[204:21.71]Alright.
[204:22.87]I think I can- I'm gonna hold that sheep.
[204:24.52]I'm gonna hold the meat.
[204:27.54]I'm gonna give this to you because I want you to have more health.
[204:32.81]Yeah.
[204:34.01]Oh, they don't make noise.
[204:34.83]Oh, okay.
[204:35.57]That's cute.
[204:46.06]Hold the sheep, hold the meat.
[204:47.74]I think so.
[204:48.14]If I get another fish, then the whole thing changes.
[204:50.42]Alright.
[205:00.52]Whoa, he did way more than I thought he was going to do.
[205:02.28]What was up with that?
[205:02.80]How did he just do so much damage?
[205:10.25]Oh, how did he do that much damage?
[205:11.41]Oh, because he has meat on.
[205:13.45]Shit.
[205:13.69]Okay.
[205:13.87]Okay.
[205:16.66]Alright, well, first loss.
[205:17.48]That's fine.
[205:20.42]That's the plan.
[205:23.90]Going... Alright, I'm combining fish.
[205:31.73]And I'm going to go with sheep and dog.
[205:39.23]Or do I go sheep?
[205:47.69]Hell, the otter.
[205:51.49]That dog now.
[205:54.73]Then sheep instead of... I feel like the otter, this 2-2 is so good, though.
[206:00.47]Maybe the giraffe.
[206:06.02]Hmm.
[206:13.82]Maybe.
[206:17.45]Only when you buy otters.
[206:19.65]That's true, but giving somebody a 2-2 permanently right now is a pretty big deal.
[206:28.48]Let's put the meatbone on the dog.
[206:32.76]Or meatbone on the fish.
[206:34.86]Or ant.
[206:35.08]Okay.
[206:51.12]I like that because that's 10 damage right up front.
[206:55.73]Let's roll.
[206:56.41]I got some more rolls to do.
[206:57.73]Let's see exactly what I'm talking about.
[206:58.93]That's why I held on to him.
[207:01.53]Because this is, I mean, that's... I can't do it twice.
[207:08.53]I can put the sheep out there and I'm going to freeze the otter.
[207:13.49]We'll put out the sheep and we'll roll.
[207:25.10]okay alright whatever let's go correct order dog champ please say dog with a Boston accent dog dog dog dog I don't know what you mean
[207:53.30]Now we're gonna play the otter.
[207:55.20]And then we can just probably sell the otter after that, maybe.
[207:57.33]Depends.
[207:58.09]If I get another otter, that's a big deal.
[207:59.25]That's annoying.
[208:06.65]Save with a British accent.
[208:09.12]Dog.
[208:19.39]I needed fish too.
[208:20.59]Fish would be a big deal as well.
[208:21.77]Alright, let's roll.
[208:26.61]Garlic the dog probably.
[208:27.71]I don't want the bone anymore.
[208:28.81]Maybe give the bone to the fish.
[208:37.01]I want fish.
[208:40.11]Fish or dog again.
[208:42.85]I'll take the sheep maybe.
[208:49.28]Yeah.
[208:51.59]Do this now.
[208:52.13]Fuck.
[208:55.41]Okay.
[209:00.23]Stay with a shpee accent.
[209:02.63]Yuck.
[209:04.19]Yuck.
[209:13.61]I gotta last.
[209:14.23]If I can last a little bit longer, I can level up a bunch of stuff.
[209:23.15]No, let's go.
[209:27.82]You have to have summons for the dog.
[209:30.10]Yeah, but that fish gives 1-1 to everybody.
[209:33.00]I really want to... And he's 9-10.
[209:34.06]It's like the only thing that's hurting anything right now.
[209:38.25]Oh, come on now.
[209:39.17]Really?
[209:39.41]Did that actually just happen?
[209:53.42]Can be close, but I still gotta... Do I, though?
[209:57.25]I don't.
[209:59.39]Shit.
[209:59.79]No, I do.
[210:00.23]Alright, I was gonna be really upset about that one.
[210:05.45]No, no more accents!
[210:06.79]I'm not doing any more accents.
[210:12.98]I can pill ant.
[210:18.20]And then I need some more summon stuff.
[210:20.50]Cricket is a summon, but meh.
[210:25.51]Alright.
[210:26.41]Alright.
[210:27.43]Alright.
[210:29.85]Now we're talking a little bit here.
[210:31.37]Okay.
[210:38.76]Okay, if I get a level 2 dog, then this thing's going to get fed and it's going to be amazing.
[210:45.24]I know I'm going to do that, so I'll just do it.
[210:57.26]Do I just do this now?
[211:02.43]Roll for another dog?
[211:17.12]Yes!
[211:18.80]Bingo!
[211:20.08]Bingo!
[211:21.54]Absolute bingo right here.
[211:23.11]Hell yeah.
[211:26.03]Alright.
[211:28.51]Now.
[211:32.72]This is good too.
[211:34.12]I'm going to hold on to this.
[211:38.36]Next round we're going to make a bunch of moves.
[211:41.94]Okay.
[211:42.53]Next round is a bunch of moves.
[211:45.23]Dog is going to get 2-2 for every single person that is summoned.
[211:49.91]Which should be alright.
[211:51.07]That should probably take us through at least the next round or two.
[211:55.34]Say that when you just said it in a Brooklyn accent.
[211:58.38]So I got the dog.
[212:00.44]I got the dog at level two.
[212:02.82]And when the penguin comes up here, I'll be drinking my coffee and the penguin will fucking just annihilate everybody.
[212:10.58]That's in a row.
[212:11.32]You know what I mean?
[212:12.08]They can take people out in a row.
[212:13.29]It's pretty good.
[212:15.35]I've only had two coffees, so... I don't know.
[212:20.43]Probably going to have to have a third.
[212:26.77]Say that again, but in a dog accent.
[212:28.41]Okay.
[212:43.01]I think I lose.
[212:47.82]Oh, it depends how- if I can get past this fish, then it's over.
[212:52.26]Nine.
[212:52.74]Fuck, no!
[212:59.83]Does Jerma do literally everything chat asks him to?
[213:04.79]Not everything, just a major- okay, now we- this is- I gotta sit here for a second.
[213:11.44]Because... This gives everybody 1-1.
[213:16.36]I wanna make sure the right people are up there.
[213:17.94]This is gonna give somebody a 2-2.
[213:20.54]This, when I sell it, gives somebody a 4-2.
[213:24.14]So I need- what do I do first?
[213:28.20]Because I'm selling you, so I'm going to have to do that first.
[213:32.12]Let's do that.
[213:32.70]Because I know I'm doing that.
[213:40.03]That's the best person it could have just happened to.
[213:43.39]Now, we bring the otter in.
[213:46.80]Right?
[213:50.02]Otter is in.
[213:50.52]Oh my, you, okay, I, come on.
[213:56.16]Keep this fish?
[213:57.78]Do I keep the penguin?
[213:58.68]I don't know if I keep the penguin.
[214:07.06]I need more summons.
[214:10.02]I need some bees and shit.
[214:20.34]Or do I just do fish and then put the penguin up?
[214:25.22]Because I have three level twos.
[214:29.17]Alright, I'm going to go for it.
[214:31.21]Let's do penguin first.
[214:35.45]And then let's go with the fish.
[214:40.71]Stupid-ass parrot, really.
[214:50.47]Everyone's going to get 1-1.
[214:52.81]Except for the sheep, but that's okay.
[214:53.99]Okay.
[214:56.93]Dog needs to go last, right?
[215:02.03]Well.
[215:03.69]Alright, I have another chance after this.
[215:07.07]That's too bad.
[215:07.93]Level tier 5, that sucks.
[215:13.33]Parrot and dog, maybe.
[215:15.09]Wait.
[215:19.10]I'll try it.
[215:20.98]Sheep can't be in the front.
[215:26.44]Alright, that looks good.
[215:32.53]Nice.
[215:34.67]I think I'm okay.
[215:40.51]Looks okay.
[215:40.93]He has a lot of buffs.
[215:50.14]Ow.
[215:57.06]I need more summons bad.
[215:58.14]Otherwise that dog is not gonna... Shit.
[216:04.07]This is bad.
[216:07.01]Very bad.
[216:08.85]Very bad.
[216:12.11]I need more summons.
[216:17.13]Damn it.
[216:17.55]This like turned out... It started so well.
[216:19.21]Fuck.
[216:22.01]I gotta get rid of the otter.
[216:26.73]And the penguin, probably.
[216:27.69]No.
[216:30.06]I need somebody that summons shit.
[216:34.86]Parrot the sheep.
[216:38.68]Good parrot the sheep.
[216:43.78]Well, let's do... I mean, this is just a no-brainer.
[216:46.87]Let's roll for another sheep.
[216:51.77]And we got it.
[216:52.91]Okay, this is good.
[216:53.73]This is perfect.
[216:54.23]We're gonna parrot the sheep.
[216:57.47]Unless something crazy comes up.
[217:03.88]That's not crazy.
[217:06.26]So here we go.
[217:07.78]Let's get rid of the otter.
[217:08.96]Should I get rid of the otter?
[217:10.94]Or the penguin?
[217:11.93]Probably the otter.
[217:17.55]Yeah.
[217:17.69]Yeah.
[217:25.53]Okay, so now I get double the summon.
[217:27.29]It's going to be two, four, four rams.
[217:28.75]I'm going to hold on to this food.
[217:31.99]Hold on to both foods, actually, and see if I can get something good for the next round.
[217:34.76]I have to survive this round.
[217:39.80]No, I can't.
[217:40.68]Why would I freeze that?
[217:41.58]If I die, it's over.
[217:45.44]Okay, well, this is it.
[217:51.20]I think everyone's in the place that it possibly can be in.
[217:55.82]I have to hope that the dog can get buffed up.
[218:01.46]There won't be enough room for the rams.
[218:03.02]Should I move them back?
[218:04.64]Like this?
[218:07.42]I think that's the play.
[218:11.24]Otherwise, yeah, I won't fit.
[218:12.12]Okay.
[218:21.07]Good luck.
[218:27.30]Is this cute Darkest Dungeon?
[218:35.04]This is a victory.
[218:36.73]I get to go another time.
[218:37.47]Maybe not.
[218:41.55]Oof.
[218:44.07]Yes, I can, I think.
[218:47.23]Unless that ox causes a problem.
[218:50.12]Which I think I'm fine.
[218:50.74]Because here it comes again.
[219:00.14]Nice.
[219:01.32]Okay, we're good.
[219:09.20]Darkest Dungeon for kids.
[219:11.54]I think I just throw this whole thing away.
[219:31.74]Worm.
[219:34.72]I think it's too... Who am I going to replace?
[219:37.88]The penguin?
[219:49.64]It's too late.
[219:50.26]It's way too late.
[219:52.59]Okay, the penguin gives three people 1-1.
[219:56.21]This is him giving himself 1-1 if he eats food.
[219:59.63]It's just spread out more.
[220:00.61]No, I gotta throw the whole thing away.
[220:07.41]Hmm.
[220:10.98]A whale could eat the parrot after he copies this?
[220:19.60]Right?
[220:19.98]So then we'd get... Okay.
[220:21.74]Okay.
[220:23.72]Wail the parrot, because the parrot copies this.
[220:26.64]This is gonna happen first.
[220:35.91]Start a va- Yeah, this is start a battle, swallow friend.
[220:38.23]This is end turn, so he does this first.
[220:40.13]Parrot does it first.
[220:44.01]Use the can first, yeah.
[220:45.41]Absolutely.
[220:51.62]So, if I get rid of the penguin...
[220:54.51]Will this actually work?
[220:56.64]I'm kind of curious.
[220:57.48]Let's find out.
[221:08.18]You're going to copy your moves.
[221:10.02]You're going to die, become two.
[221:11.42]You're going to die, become two.
[221:12.68]He's going to spit you out.
[221:13.78]You're going to die and become two.
[221:20.96]Alright.
[221:26.89]Wait, the whale goes first.
[221:29.93]Oh, wait a minute.
[221:31.15]Yeah.
[221:34.86]It's at the start of the battle, so he's gonna eat him.
[221:37.50]He's gonna turn.
[221:38.14]I think it still is more.
[221:40.66]Okay.
[221:43.48]Well, let's just go.
[221:44.12]Oh, Jesus.
[221:48.09]Am I actually gonna... I have to survive.
[221:51.69]I have to survive.
[222:03.05]I think we just do Sushi.
[222:09.11]And just hope for the best.
[222:14.52]Or I could put Parrot in too.
[222:17.90]Sushi gives 3-1-1s.
[222:19.52]This will give the Parrot up to what?
[222:22.16]Like a 7-something?
[222:23.24]8-something?
[222:25.18]I think that's actually better.
[222:27.76]Yeah.
[222:27.98]8-7 is better.
[222:30.62]We can save this next turn.
[222:31.62]Alright, if I survive, then this is going to be a pretty good turn.
[222:42.41]Oh, hold on.
[222:43.31]I could have got rid of the whale.
[222:46.88]The parrot copies the other parrot.
[222:49.66]How does that work?
[222:53.78]If I had put the parrot here, a second parrot...
[222:57.20]Would that have been he copies this person, then he copies this person?
[223:01.70]Or would he copy nothing?
[223:03.74]Would the parrot copy nothing and then this parrot copy something?
[223:08.46]Oh well.
[223:09.22]Let's just go.
[223:16.26]It actually does work.
[223:17.18]Oh, because it goes right to left.
[223:22.38]This might not be a loss.
[223:29.62]I think I still win.
[223:36.62]Possible.
[223:41.37]Yeah, I definitely win.
[223:48.09]Although this elephant's got to fucking die right now because he's puffing these things up like crazy.
[223:52.77]Kill this thing.
[224:05.18]Come on.
[224:06.30]There it is.
[224:07.66]Alright, here it comes.
[224:08.76]The two.
[224:09.12]Hey!
[224:10.82]Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[224:13.51]Wait a minute.
[224:13.99]Wait just a second.
[224:16.43]Wait just a second.
[224:17.17]What's going on here?
[224:22.65]Why did he copy?
[224:23.79]What did that happen for?
[224:26.23]It turns it into a normal parrot?
[224:30.43]So when he eats something, he just removes anything that was on it before?
[224:38.46]oh man it makes an entirely new animal that it does so it's all okay it was its death was triggered which means it's a new parrot that comes out that did not copy anything oh please alright last one one more I'm done last one this is this is it
[225:12.35]This game's fun.
[225:12.99]And you know what the best part about this game is?
[225:16.99]I know that, like, okay, Hearthstone Battlegrounds I love.
[225:19.66]I used to play it all the time.
[225:22.06]Obviously haven't really played it recently at all.
[225:25.12]But I like the fact that, I don't know how this matchmaking works, but the fact that I can just sit here for an hour and not even do anything.
[225:40.25]I don't understand how the matchmaking works.
[225:46.42]Um, alright, well, I think we're just going to pick this team.
[225:51.64]Mosquito's fine early.
[225:59.12]I think I'm going to roll.
[226:01.17]Good thing I did.
[226:08.21]How about the obese posers?
[226:10.85]The obese feet?
[226:12.53]The skilled feet?
[226:14.69]The skilled posers?
[226:19.29]Obese posers.
[226:20.57]That's so stupid.
[226:25.40]The fussy piggies.
[226:33.02]You already buffed that?
[226:34.02]How?
[226:35.35]Food?
[226:37.77]That's huge.
[226:39.53]That's bad.
[226:52.27]Game's results are predetermined from the start.
[226:53.67]You just watch it unfold before your eyes.
[226:56.95]How is it matchmaking people?
[226:59.79]Is it just based on how many trophies and how many hearts you have and it just finds somebody else that has that amount of hearts and trophies?
[227:11.96]That's a really cool way to do this.
[227:18.06]It's by turn.
[227:20.20]If you're on the same turn.
[227:22.62]That's kind of cool.
[227:27.58]Because it really doesn't even matter when you press the button.
[227:35.75]These are old teams from the past that are saved.
[227:37.67]These aren't live.
[227:40.97]Really?
[227:41.23]So they're ghosts of other teams.
[227:52.35]That would explain the lack of timer.
[227:54.73]That's really, really cool.
[227:55.99]There's always a saved team somewhere.
[228:07.48]Someone is losing to you right now or beating you from yesterday or an hour ago.
[228:17.49]That's some pretty big brain game development right there.
[228:22.52]okay uh what do I want to do I think I'm throwing this whole hand away yep good um excuse me hold on a second I right clicked and dragged I swear to god I swear on everything you even saw me hesitate
[228:51.18]I hesitated, and I was like, wait, I'm going to make sure I'm right-clicking.
[228:53.64]And I right-clicked and dragged.
[228:55.64]It's not, it doesn't matter.
[228:56.58]Oh, yeah.
[229:02.57]Okay, well, let's, now I have to buy a beaver.
[229:05.55]I need, I need stats.
[229:10.65]I just, I have to buy the duck, too.
[229:11.99]Like, I need stats now.
[229:13.41]I'm screwed.
[229:22.86]Single click and move them if you're worried about them mixing.
[229:30.13]This team is awful.
[229:31.01]Well, it's about to be pretty good because I'm going to sell the duck immediately.
[229:33.61]God damn it.
[229:49.80]I think I still would have lost.
[229:56.82]We're doing that for sure.
[229:57.74]Because I want the peacock.
[230:03.40]Peacock.
[230:06.54]I'm going to combine the beaver, I think.
[230:08.56]Or just sell.
[230:09.24]Let's see what I get.
[230:20.03]Very nice.
[230:22.09]All is not lost.
[230:25.48]Yes, it is.
[230:35.63]Heal attack damage to adjacent pets.
[230:38.11]That sucks.
[230:38.89]It needs to be last.
[230:40.93]Put the badger in the back.
[230:49.27]Combine the beavers.
[230:52.41]Put the badger in the back.
[231:14.48]No.
[231:14.82]Did you fart?
[231:19.42]Yeah.
[231:29.09]Worst voice.
[231:31.09]Speaking of worst voice.
[231:32.97]The nominees are going to open up.
[231:35.15]Probably in like a week or two.
[231:36.96]Maybe like two weeks.
[231:39.66]For you to nominate things for worst and best of the year, you'll have some categories to look through.
[231:44.47]Categories will be known in advance.
[231:48.43]I'm hoping for the first week of December.
[231:50.01]And finally, victory, crying out loud.
[232:12.57]I didn't see the last part, apparently.
[232:14.61]Okay.
[232:16.05]Kill the ant.
[232:17.71]Hopefully it goes to... Alright.
[232:21.57]I'm gonna sell the mosquito.
[232:25.51]Let me roll.
[232:26.21]Sell the mosquito.
[232:29.33]Kill the ant.
[232:29.97]Hope it lands on the peacock.
[232:34.49]Sell the mosquito.
[232:35.49]Sell the beaver.
[232:36.88]But then I'm killing everybody.
[232:43.94]Alright, I know I'm selling the mosquito.
[232:46.51]If I sell the beaver, hopefully it gives it the health to him.
[232:49.65]Sell your kidneys.
[232:52.97]This sucks, but I kind of have to do it.
[232:57.00]Shit.
[232:57.92]No more crabs.
[233:03.02]Oh, the elephant.
[233:03.84]Shit, you're right.
[233:05.60]Alright, we're good.
[233:07.02]Okay, sell the beaver.
[233:11.27]That sucks, but whatever.
[233:14.18]Okay, now, pill... I'm going to have to pick... Oh, shit.
[233:17.94]Okay.
[233:18.76]Is this stupid, what I'm doing?
[233:19.92]Should I just buy the swan?
[233:33.05]Or should I roll for something better?
[233:34.15]Crab on the peacock?
[233:37.48]Swan it up.
[233:43.14]It would be an eight health crab.
[233:45.30]Yeah, that's probably better for right now.
[233:50.02]I am going to... No, I'm not.
[233:55.75]Okay.
[234:02.92]I could just... Okay.
[234:03.70]I got an idea.
[234:15.58]Why do I have a sus command?
[234:16.78]Because I've... Okay, I've been around... It's not Among Us.
[234:25.48]Before Among Us, I did a thing like five years ago.
[234:28.82]I don't even need to explain this.
[234:32.64]It's part of a game.
[234:33.49]It's part of a game called Sorcery.
[234:34.73]Steve... Okay.
[234:41.31]Oh, it's a... Yeah, it's a... Okay.
[234:50.63]I've not lost or won anything.
[234:51.91]Okay.
[235:02.31]What do we got?
[235:02.77]I know that's going to happen.
[235:06.84]Wait.
[235:07.06]Okay.
[235:11.08]So if I give this to the peacock, if he doesn't actually take the damage, does that, that means he doesn't get the buff, right?
[235:20.21]If I garlic the peacock, it's not technically going to get hurt.
[235:26.59]Needs to be hurt, right?
[235:27.63]So wouldn't it go to 0?
[235:28.31]Because it does 1 damage.
[235:32.39]It doesn't any hurt?
[235:33.45]It has to be a minimum of 1 damage.
[235:38.39]Garlic blocks to a minimum of 1 damage, not to 0?
[235:42.89]That's not what it says.
[235:43.61]It will always do at least 1, even with garlic.
[235:48.18]Okay.
[235:48.32]Okay.
[235:53.47]Now the question is... I don't really want the rabbit.
[236:01.14]Do I want the food?
[236:02.64]Let's see what happens.
[236:09.98]Okay.
[236:22.26]I need another unit though, don't I?
[236:23.74]That will make him an 8-8.
[236:54.79]I think I got this one.
[236:58.54]That's wonderful actually, what just happened.
[237:00.50]That was unbelievable what just happened.
[237:03.30]Alright, well he's gonna die regardless, but at least he'll kill the whale.
[237:21.29]Shit.
[237:25.06]It's okay, though.
[237:26.76]Turns out the crab was a great... Oh, that's bad.
[237:32.02]Oh!
[237:35.50]Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[237:37.22]Because it does its attack damage to... Now it makes sense as to why you use this.
[237:44.15]I thought this thing was terrible.
[237:49.33]Alright.
[237:58.13]Pufferfish, okay, if this guy gets to level two, he does one damage to two things behind him.
[238:05.12]So, the pufferfish would make sense, but I need another elephant.
[238:16.89]Put a bee on the badger.
[238:20.23]I'm gonna stop freezing this guy.
[238:28.98]I need an elephant or honey.
[238:34.16]But I'm out of money, so I think I'm just going to have to... I'm not sure.
[238:41.65]Should I just feed the badger and put the puffer up?
[238:58.46]But he's only going to hit one behind, and the crab needs to copy the peacock.
[239:05.18]But the peacock is the one that gets the most benefit from getting hit by this.
[239:08.09]Okay, if I do this, I just have to really hope that I get a second elephant.
[239:14.53]That's what this whole thing is based around.
[239:26.53]Alright, well, I'm going to feed the badger because that's six damage.
[239:34.20]And I'm just going to have to see if this works.
[239:36.64]Put the puffer in the front.
[239:39.66]I feel like he's going to die instantly.
[239:40.80]Because you have to get hurt and stay alive.
[239:46.82]If you die, you don't get to do it.
[239:48.14]Yeah, it has to be like this.
[240:01.75]Alright, well, I hope I get a- I have nine health.
[240:06.53]I just hope that I get another elephant.
[240:10.47]Another elephant, this is much better.
[240:12.49]It looks really good, actually.
[240:13.52]Uh-oh.
[240:24.02]Shit.
[240:25.08]Well, at least that dies.
[240:31.99]Very good.
[240:34.83]Very good.
[240:36.77]But is it good enough?
[240:38.87]Is it good enough?
[240:39.65]It is.
[240:52.40]Give me an elephant.
[240:53.30]Give me another elephant.
[240:56.56]Give me another elephant.
[241:00.24]Or another puffer.
[241:05.99]I should garlic the puffer.
[241:07.05]Alright.
[241:17.13]Elephant.
[241:19.05]Elephant.
[241:20.55]Shit.
[241:22.03]Damn it.
[241:22.81]No.
[241:23.11]Crab?
[241:27.15]Would this potentially triple?
[241:29.58]What happens if this does not upgrade when leveling?
[241:31.46]Never mind.
[241:31.86]Okay.
[241:39.36]I think it's just feed the badger.
[241:41.32]Because that's going to do seven damage.
[241:58.48]I'm just trying to like win like attrition here.
[242:01.19]I'm trying just to stay alive until I can really level up the elephant.
[242:06.10]So if everything dies, but at least it kills the last thing, that's... I want to make sure it can.
[242:13.81]Kill that monkey in the back.
[242:14.61]Come on.
[242:16.33]Again.
[242:16.55]Shit.
[242:19.80]Sorry.
[242:23.68]That's brutal.
[242:24.36]That's bad, but it's okay.
[242:26.14]I think it's still... Yep.
[242:27.84]I'm good.
[242:30.80]Badger stays alive.
[242:40.31]Nice.
[242:42.15]Very nice.
[242:43.23]Finally.
[242:43.79]Elephant.
[242:45.07]So then he'll be doing damage to two people behind him.
[242:51.25]Turkey.
[242:52.07]I don't have anything.
[242:52.69]I just don't have anything that's good enough for it.
[242:56.96]Alright.
[242:57.40]I have no summons really.
[243:06.88]I'll take it.
[243:15.11]Replace the crab with the turkey.
[243:16.37]I don't think so.
[243:17.77]Nothing's summoned.
[243:18.39]I don't have any summons.
[243:28.04]Oh, there's honey for the badger, right?
[243:30.82]Do I want to do that?
[243:31.98]I think that's what I want to do.
[243:39.90]Because then...
[243:44.14]Ooh, I want that too.
[243:46.85]Who do I replace?
[243:47.49]I don't think I can even take the monkey.
[243:56.73]I like this team.
[244:01.21]Well, we'll find out.
[244:02.67]Let's go.
[244:02.93]Now this is going to get very interesting.
[244:07.75]I need to start scaling.
[244:11.35]Yeah, that's true.
[244:22.44]Nice.
[244:24.98]At least got to do it once.
[244:28.34]Fuck.
[244:33.14]Bad.
[244:35.78]Crab has been carrying.
[244:37.10]Look at what the crab's been doing here.
[244:40.24]Oh, come on.
[244:41.06]No.
[244:44.34]Shit.
[244:44.90]It hit the wrong person.
[244:46.07]Oh, no.
[244:51.25]Oh, well.
[245:00.95]Hmm.
[245:03.64]I think I have to replace the badger.
[245:06.96]Crab has been doing so well.
[245:08.82]He's a 9-10.
[245:09.34]Crab's going to start to fall off.
[245:27.63]It's the badger and crab for the monkey and the elephant.
[245:30.91]You can really start growing your front three.
[245:38.00]The badger, maybe it is time to get rid of the crab and just put the monkey out.
[245:43.07]Yeah, that's probably the play.
[245:50.13]So then he'll be constantly giving the elephant tutu.
[246:01.17]Keep you in the back.
[246:02.15]Alright, let's feed the elephant.
[246:03.43]No, actually, not yet.
[246:04.27]There might be better food.
[246:05.37]Let's roll.
[246:11.80]Aye.
[246:12.82]Okay.
[246:17.74]I don't know if I want to do this right now.
[246:19.12]Because I think I want to give the cupcake to the elephant.
[246:24.72]I don't want to lose.
[246:41.79]The elephant has to survive for the peacock upgrade to even matter.
[246:44.23]The camel might be a good replacement for the... Alright, wait a minute.
[246:58.56]The camel gets hit.
[246:59.50]It gives one two to the person behind, which is the peacock.
[247:05.16]Which gets... So it would be giving... Every time the elephant attacks...
[247:10.62]the peacock would be getting re-two every time the elephant attacks.
[247:18.93]Which, that's kind of insane.
[247:25.10]I'm gonna go for it.
[247:40.47]I have two gold.
[247:41.27]Do I freeze the cupcake?
[247:43.29]Alright, we got something else to hold on to.
[247:50.93]Really?
[247:51.17]Oh.
[247:56.44]Oh, it's too late for the scorpion.
[248:00.18]Unless I want to get rid of the monkey?
[248:01.76]Yeah, the cupcake is temporary, but at this stage I probably need it to scale.
[248:12.46]Actually, that's not what does kind of suck right now.
[248:15.88]It's never too late for the scorpion.
[248:17.43]Yeah, but who do I replace?
[248:18.63]The monkey?
[248:19.47]I feel like the monkey needs to be here for a few turns for him to be worth even buying in the first place.
[248:31.00]Yeah, I don't think I even care about this.
[248:33.34]It's too late now.
[248:35.52]I'm going with this meta here.
[248:43.29]I have to hope that the peacock just goes absolutely crazy.
[248:46.51]Alright, there we go.
[248:51.14]It should see at least a few hits.
[248:56.76]Here it is.
[248:57.12]Boom, boom.
[249:01.20]It's gonna kill the... Alright, nice.
[249:03.78]Perfect.
[249:05.04]That counts, though, because it was alive.
[249:07.06]Does it not count?
[249:07.68]It was alive when it happened, though, right?
[249:08.96]Does it not count?
[249:14.80]Oh, this is perfect.
[249:15.62]Am I going to be able to kill the dog because of this?
[249:21.25]Oh, come on.
[249:22.15]No.
[249:23.23]Damn it.
[249:24.85]Get that shit out of here.
[249:27.29]Oh, well.
[249:38.12]I think I still lost anyways.
[249:42.92]Well, I can't die again.
[249:47.79]Aye, aye, aye.
[249:49.11]Well, this is a certain play here.
[249:51.41]Chain four attack.
[249:59.45]Why a tier one pet give all friends one one?
[250:09.48]Elephant, elephant.
[250:19.89]Maybe get rid of the badger.
[250:20.81]Freeze the dragon, maybe.
[250:26.23]Alright, elephant.
[250:27.80]Cupcake on elephant.
[250:30.26]Dude, double elephant?
[250:38.14]Get rid of badger.
[250:40.36]Go with just double elephant.
[250:45.63]I think so.
[250:48.73]Go for a camel upgrade.
[250:51.77]Wait, wouldn't double elephant not make any sense?
[250:55.33]Because it has to attack.
[250:57.65]So wouldn't I just be hitting my own elephant?
[251:00.59]I don't think that's a good idea.
[251:02.27]I mean, I could upgrade the elephant again.
[251:09.21]That uses all my money.
[251:10.45]I don't know.
[251:14.78]I almost kind of want to look for the camel.
[251:28.22]I wonder if I should try to upgrade the elephant, or should I just roll everything and look for the camel?
[251:35.86]Or if it's a levelly elephant?
[251:37.02]I have to survive, though.
[251:40.69]Whatever.
[251:41.01]Okay.
[251:49.35]Alright.
[251:51.55]Alright, we're gonna do this.
[251:56.81]And just hope for the best.
[252:09.77]Is it enough?
[252:10.17]Okay.
[252:18.84]Is it at least enough to do it twice?
[252:22.56]Bingo.
[252:29.25]Come on.
[252:30.81]Get that shit out of here.
[252:32.17]Do I lose?
[252:35.74]I think it's still, let's see, seven, seven times.
[252:39.71]Damn it.
[252:47.48]No, I only had two wins.
[252:48.78]Alright, one more.
[252:52.90]This is actually the last one, I promise.
[252:55.29]Last one.
[253:12.67]Alright, we're going with this.
[253:16.75]Leaking soup.
[253:19.50]The inedible bush.
[253:22.38]Inedible bushes.
[253:26.04]Inedible soup.
[253:28.34]Leaking package.
[253:34.75]Leaking packages.
[253:38.23]That's okay.
[253:38.77]Okay.
[253:51.16]Let chat play.
[253:53.84]The game's free.
[253:54.34]You can play right now.
[253:54.98]I was going to say, if I didn't win this, or if I didn't turn this into a draw, I'm just going to... I don't know.
[254:07.42]I'm not happy.
[254:22.88]Here we go.
[254:25.26]OK, hold on a minute here.
[254:31.03]Oh.
[254:37.83]Remember, stop losing.
[254:40.62]I'm still learning.
[254:54.60]Why do you have a 4-5 duck?
[254:55.94]What happened?
[254:58.96]You have a 4-5 duck?
[255:09.04]What the fuck?
[255:33.44]Okay.
[255:35.94]And then maybe a spider.
[255:42.03]Spider in front probably of the kangaroo.
[255:47.31]And I can't wait to get rid of this duck.
[255:53.18]Okay.
[255:53.68]Good.
[255:54.06]Let's go.
[255:58.58]Nice.
[255:59.82]Very nice.
[256:04.02]Don't talk with food in your mouth?
[256:05.94]Alright.
[256:08.33]Can't wait for the next six super auto pet streams.
[256:13.87]I mean, this game passes time very, very easily.
[256:18.40]It takes 15 seconds to open this and get in a game.
[256:21.22]It's not like I wouldn't ever play it again, but I don't know.
[256:28.06]I think it's fun.
[256:34.00]Very good.
[256:35.68]Go ahead and get this out of the way.
[256:48.69]Alright, turtle is... Okay.
[256:51.33]Sell the duck.
[256:54.93]Turtle going up.
[256:58.45]And I want turtle to go in front of the kangaroo.
[257:00.31]No, I don't.
[257:02.09]Who do I want the turtle to go in front of?
[257:11.15]I think I want to do... Okay, hold on.
[257:14.07]In front of the spider, but... I think I need to... I don't know.
[257:25.36]Sell the cricket and crab.
[257:31.73]Yeah, but he has the five damage on him, though.
[257:36.13]Is he even being funny?
[257:37.09]Dude, yeah.
[257:37.57]The reason why I'm so tired is I just did a three-hour non-stop stand-up routine.
[257:44.09]I'm just kind of chilling now.
[257:46.33]I'm exhausted.
[258:00.70]Kangaroo has to see somebody in front of him attack.
[258:05.79]turtle when it dies it gives melon armor to the person behind it I guess I'd have to be here and then I want to do this this is stupid probably but maybe
[258:37.06]This is stupid, but whatever.
[258:41.92]Oh, that's right.
[258:43.06]Melon armor cancels because it's its own thing.
[258:55.49]Well, I'm kind of screwed now.
[258:56.61]I think I have to do this.
[259:01.07]Or do this.
[259:03.80]Then the kangaroo doesn't get very much benefit.
[259:05.24]Yeah, I messed this up a little bit.
[259:13.75]Okay, so then he can hit.
[259:14.71]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[259:15.95]Alright, let's go.
[259:20.79]The spider will get to hit at least.
[259:22.55]I'm going to lose the bee, but it's being replaced by swinging at least twice.
[259:34.39]I've been streaming for four and a half hours.
[259:35.96]What the fuck is going on here?
[259:37.32]I was supposed to be live for like 45 minutes.
[259:53.55]Yeah, that's good.
[260:01.67]Alright, that's two wins.
[260:07.90]Okay.
[260:08.92]I'm thinking about let's upgrade the spider.
[260:13.90]Sell the ant.
[260:19.91]Sell the ant.
[260:21.11]Upgrade spider.
[260:24.85]I don't think anyone's leaving right now.
[260:26.25]Although, hold on.
[260:29.11]Let me just make sure no one else is leaving.
[260:35.00]Or I could pill the turtle and then they get permanent melon armor.
[260:53.11]That's not bad.
[260:54.93]That works, right?
[260:57.47]And then the spider will have melon armor forever?
[261:02.14]I can pill the ant later.
[261:03.00]The pill will show up again.
[261:08.77]He'll sell the spider in not too long from now, though.
[261:11.37]Will I, even if I upgrade him?
[261:19.97]Pill the turtle on the kangaroo?
[261:21.69]That's not a bad idea.
[261:30.91]I like that idea.
[261:31.55]Okay.
[261:38.25]Want to do this?
[261:38.81]Or do I?
[261:41.60]Let's roll.
[261:42.06]Roll again.
[261:51.08]Hold on to this in case I lose.
[261:52.62]What do I want to do here?
[261:57.52]Swan?
[262:03.53]I could do Swan and level up Spider.
[262:14.54]Yeah.
[262:19.20]Okay.
[262:20.79]Interesting.
[262:26.71]Perfect.
[262:27.57]Nice.
[262:28.44]Very, very nice.
[262:29.32]I'm really happy about that.
[262:30.38]Alright, let's go.
[262:46.44]This is going to be bad.
[262:47.32]I should have had the cricket go first.
[262:48.46]Okay.
[263:03.88]Very nice.
[263:06.74]It's not going to be enough, I don't think.
[263:09.42]Let's see.
[263:10.42]It is not.
[263:11.54]Ugh!
[263:11.84]Ugh!
[263:23.05]Okay, so I'm gonna kill the ant, play the snail, sell the snail.
[263:29.86]Go ahead and do that.
[263:39.83]Kill the ant.
[263:45.83]I didn't want you to get that, but whatever.
[263:48.23]Snail.
[263:48.69]Sell the snail.
[263:53.62]Meet the swan.
[264:01.89]Um... I mean, maybe the badger?
[264:05.65]I think that's the play.
[264:25.59]Okay.
[264:27.57]Roll the whole thing.
[264:28.09]Just in case, because I'm going to sell something next turn anyways.
[264:33.71]Ah, these are not good right now.
[264:35.46]Alright.
[264:38.54]I think this is okay.
[264:45.78]Good luck.
[264:46.90]To me.
[264:56.57]I really need splash damage.
[265:08.80]I think this is okay.
[265:15.42]That dog's not gonna be a problem.
[265:30.25]Yeah.
[265:32.91]When are you going to play Destiny 2 PvP?
[265:36.09]I already did.
[265:36.51]I just deleted the VOD because I was embarrassed about it.
[265:40.92]I just turned off notifications to subs and stuff and followers.
[265:48.34]And I just played like three or four hours of it and I was just like, I'm not into this.
[265:51.64]I mean, it's alright.
[265:53.44]I just deleted the VOD and shit because I don't want anyone to see it.
[265:57.26]I remember that, yeah.
[265:59.53]It's like fucking, yeah.
[266:01.87]Well, I won, so we're going to keep the snail frozen.
[266:07.73]Oh, honey on the badger.
[266:09.71]Honey on the badger.
[266:11.61]What am I doing?
[266:13.36]Oh, that stream was so bad.
[266:14.52]It was so sad.
[266:16.74]I know.
[266:20.12]Honey on the badger.
[266:28.75]Alright, I really, really want a spider or kangaroo upgrade.
[266:38.73]No, no!
[266:39.61]Okay, we'll do meat.
[266:41.27]No, we won't.
[266:41.85]Look at the swan.
[266:53.68]Yeah, that's the only thing I can really do.
[266:59.32]Okay.
[266:59.75]Probably gonna lose, but I'll get a good next turn.
[267:02.99]Is this a phone game?
[267:12.58]It's not a phone game.
[267:28.16]Literally a phone game.
[267:31.04]This game is on Steam right now.
[267:34.38]Is Clash of Clans on Steam?
[267:37.04]No.
[267:40.04]That's a phone game.
[267:53.37]I won again.
[267:53.91]Okay.
[267:54.27]Okay.
[267:57.03]Well, we need to roll for some upgrades.
[268:05.16]No.
[268:16.67]Just has to replace somebody, but who?
[268:23.36]I feel like I need both of these.
[268:27.40]And the rooster has to go in the front.
[268:36.60]I get rid of the cricket.
[268:38.32]I think the... Or the spider.
[268:40.26]What gets me more value here?
[268:45.36]The spider, I think.
[268:49.04]The cricket currently does more damage than the spider, but the spider makes the kangaroo better.
[268:54.49]And I'm almost about to level him up.
[269:00.51]Alright.
[269:01.23]This is bad, but we have to do it.
[269:08.90]Because then this will get really, really good.
[269:24.93]I wonder if I can... Should I move the... No, I think it stays there.
[269:29.46]But the swan might move.
[269:33.76]Hold on.
[269:34.54]Let's just see what we get here.
[269:36.02]Right?
[269:36.80]I have a roll.
[269:40.30]And I'm not going to buy any of these.
[269:41.78]You know what I mean?
[269:42.90]Let's just roll.
[269:43.36]Let's see if we get something good.
[269:51.29]Alright.
[269:52.87]This is going here.
[269:56.45]Okay.
[269:57.97]This is big.
[270:08.97]Okay.
[270:09.57]Take a look at this shit.
[270:10.69]Perfect.
[270:11.63]Roll again.
[270:14.51]Okay.
[270:14.99]Alright.
[270:15.71]Okay.
[270:17.34]I just have to survive to another turn.
[270:19.06]And this is big.
[270:19.72]This is bingo.
[270:23.20]Even if I lose, I can't sell anything.
[270:24.68]I don't think this nail might have to go.
[270:27.40]Find out.
[270:38.99]Um... Well... I'll at least get rid of the elephant.
[270:48.23]That hippo is really dangerous.
[270:49.43]Swan should kill... Not both of them, but...
[270:57.67]It's alright.
[271:01.74]Ooh.
[271:03.62]Good.
[271:06.90]Scary.
[271:07.82]Good thing I had the melon armor.
[271:10.44]That would have been very scary.
[271:12.47]What the fuck happened?
[271:14.33]No.
[271:16.99]I can't.
[271:20.40]Oh, man, that sucked.
[271:22.12]Oh, come on.
[271:22.98]Oh, but look at what it gave me.
[271:25.78]It gave me triple.
[271:27.38]Alright.
[271:28.16]Oh, shit.
[271:31.02]So, I think the play is sell the swan, get rid of the swan, upgrade the monkey, put the snail up, sell the snail for the sheep.
[271:45.16]Maybe?
[271:45.32]Maybe?
[271:53.51]Well, I know I'm doing this.
[271:54.99]This is certain.
[271:57.15]Like, this is just certainty.
[272:00.55]So, just do it.
[272:01.51]4-4.
[272:07.63]Gorilla in front.
[272:09.17]4-4.
[272:09.25]Get rid of the swan.
[272:21.44]Yeah.
[272:24.32]Okay, we're going to get rid of this one.
[272:26.44]Gorilla's going in the front.
[272:27.86]But not yet!
[272:28.38]Hold on.
[272:36.31]Okay.
[272:41.31]Let's go.
[272:49.52]This should be a winning hand.
[272:56.84]Would have been awesome to get another gorilla.
[273:01.28]Okay.
[273:05.37]I like the way this is set up.
[273:06.83]Hopefully it works out.
[273:13.91]12-12 gorilla with the coconut shield.
[273:17.01]He has to activate it though, which is scary.
[273:19.93]Okay, I will.
[273:21.36]Nice.
[273:26.61]Took off the melon armor.
[273:28.21]Oh, you son of a gun.
[273:34.20]Oh, you son of a gun.
[273:35.00]Rerecorded stream.
[273:47.57]Sag.
[273:57.50]Fuck, okay.
[274:05.36]But wait.
[274:08.04]Um... I don't know what to do at this point.
[274:20.51]I can upgrade gorilla.
[274:24.37]And then feed gorilla.
[274:31.60]The spider sucks.
[274:35.61]Put in two... Okay.
[274:40.88]Is it time to get rid of the kangaroo?
[274:42.10]Or the spider?
[274:44.44]Because the kangaroo is really awful without the spider in front of him.
[274:54.84]Kangaroo is better with the spider.
[274:56.18]Okay, so what's better though?
[274:58.35]Because this is just a free 22 damage, right?
[275:04.43]Put the rooster in front of the kangaroo.
[275:09.99]So that works still.
[275:11.77]Sell the spider.
[275:14.01]Upgrade the gorilla and have double monkey.
[275:22.85]Like, we're talking two slots, right?
[275:25.03]So the gorilla gets a 6-6?
[275:27.52]Alright, we're going for it.
[275:31.00]That's cool.
[275:34.66]So this is gonna go here.
[275:38.54]And then upgrade the gorilla.
[275:42.62]And then feed the gorilla.
[275:47.23]Alright, let's go.
[275:48.01]This is gonna be a huge deal.
[275:53.63]Alright, let's do it.
[275:59.53]21, 21.
[276:02.83]That's a big boy.
[276:05.40]Oh, but that's an even, that's a bigger one.
[276:07.66]That one's bigger though.
[276:09.86]Oh god, that's not good.
[276:13.90]I think I still do it though.
[276:15.96]Because this is the strongest thing he has.
[276:20.12]Okay.
[276:20.22]Okay.
[276:22.93]Is it okay?
[276:25.28]No, it's not.
[276:26.78]It's alright.
[276:32.06]No, it's not alright!
[276:33.78]I wanted to get an upgraded gorilla so bad.
[276:53.09]I don't want the fever.
[276:54.71]Thank you.
[276:55.03]How about the flooded ears?
[277:07.06]This is it.
[277:08.54]I'm streaming it on Sunday.
[277:10.18]I'll be back.
[277:13.06]This is too fun.
[277:34.18]What about Friday?
[277:36.72]Oh yeah, maybe it is Friday.
[277:38.66]I'll figure it out.
[277:46.60]I gotta talk to Etalyx because we're going to play Resident Evil 6.
[277:49.08]So it's either going to be Friday or Sunday.
[277:52.24]Look out for Sunday.
[278:15.49]Alright, next turn, selling both ducks.
[278:21.35]And I'm going to try to replace the two ducks.
[278:37.90]Is this a win?
[278:38.50]5-3.
[278:39.46]That's a draw.
[278:51.00]Ever played 6 before?
[278:52.33]For about 30 minutes.
[278:56.91]Okay, um... Shit.
[279:09.21]Okay, here's the... Oh no, this sucks.
[279:11.68]I screwed... Okay, I need to do...
[279:19.22]Should I just do a weirdo porcupine build?
[279:25.12]Yeah, let's go.
[279:26.82]Watch this.
[279:28.62]Okay.
[279:29.04]Sell.
[279:29.38]Give shop pets 1-1.
[279:30.38]Okay.
[279:30.70]Alright.
[279:51.62]Then I'm going to roll.
[279:56.67]Oh, hell yeah.
[280:00.23]Alright.
[280:01.59]Sell the beaver.
[280:03.99]And then put another hedgehog up here.
[280:27.26]Good.
[280:32.17]And then combine the fish.
[280:37.71]Take a look at that.
[280:40.09]Wowie.
[280:42.63]I want that turtle.
[280:52.10]Oh wait, they have to die.
[280:59.55]That's alright.
[281:04.55]So they have to die for that to trigger.
[281:14.92]Uh, this is a win.
[281:15.99]Because... Yeah, this is guaranteed.
[281:19.83]I'm guaranteed to win.
[281:25.11]Because even if they die, they will kill.
[281:28.01]Alright.
[281:30.73]Interesting.
[281:31.17]Maybe I should combine them.
[281:46.58]Yeah, this has to be in the front.
[281:49.36]Because that will die.
[281:53.14]And then do I...
[282:00.61]I could just make one that does four damage to everybody.
[282:11.88]ELC pack?
[282:12.54]Yeah, I switched it to the normal pack because we were playing on the normal pack.
[282:17.32]And I accidentally switched the expansion one and I never switched back.
[282:22.44]They're just going to kill the fish.
[282:25.10]That's true.
[282:27.21]So why don't we do this?
[282:32.79]And then this will just play out.
[282:55.28]Alright, whatever.
[283:04.16]Peacock the Hedgehog?
[283:05.00]They do too much damage.
[283:06.16]They'll just kill it.
[283:13.06]That's two damage.
[283:14.32]Peacock has five, right?
[283:15.14]They'll just kill it.
[283:15.64]Alright, how bad is this going to go?
[283:23.07]We'll find out.
[283:26.63]Okay, ow.
[283:27.35]Oh, shit.
[283:31.25]Hey.
[283:32.59]It's not a loss.
[283:48.40]Okay.
[283:48.80]Let's just give everybody 2-2.
[283:50.84]Do I just build for that?
[283:55.10]Yeah, let's do it.
[283:55.94]Who cares?
[284:11.89]What's wrong?
[284:15.59]Move the turtle?
[284:19.99]Well, this is a disaster for this guy.
[284:28.22]Here we go.
[284:39.34]Oh, kill it all.
[284:43.44]Okay.
[284:45.00]Oh, hell yeah.
[284:47.01]Everybody loses.
[285:00.08]So I guess you have to, you garlic the hedgehogs.
[285:03.94]That sounds like a shitty new Sonic character.
[285:17.77]Because they'll only take one damage now from this.
[285:28.45]No.
[285:29.93]I want a fish.
[285:30.79]Bad.
[285:31.65]Really bad.
[285:34.96]Please.
[285:36.50]No.
[285:37.28]Oh, shit.
[285:39.80]No.
[285:51.71]Fish.
[285:57.37]Move the turtle?
[285:59.86]I like the fact that this does damage with the... Oh, no!
[286:05.07]You're right!
[286:05.55]You're right, because you can only have one buff at a time.
[286:07.39]You're right.
[286:08.53]You're right.
[286:09.15]Okay.
[286:11.19]It'll work out, though.
[286:12.15]It's fine.
[286:15.78]Now it's over.
[286:17.20]Check this out.
[286:22.18]Yep.
[286:23.44]Beautiful.
[286:25.42]Beautiful.
[286:29.03]Beautiful!
[286:32.93]Nobody gets to win.
[286:33.84]Draws only.
[286:37.54]Oh, no.
[287:02.41]God damn it.
[287:03.19]Okay.
[287:03.59]Well, what does this do now?
[287:05.89]Just four damage to everybody?
[287:10.79]Um, how am I gonna know?
[287:16.05]This is gonna be fucking horrible.
[287:22.06]I'm just gonna lose.
[287:29.42]Why the front one?
[287:32.95]This one needs to go all the way to the back.
[287:34.83]Do not do that.
[287:36.45]How do I move this to the back?
[287:41.64]How do I move this?
[287:43.92]Without it combining.
[287:53.15]Okay.
[287:55.27]Very good.
[287:55.69]So I'm going to do this.
[288:02.30]Right?
[288:03.75]That makes sense.
[288:08.57]I don't have any money for garlic.
[288:22.88]This is a huge pain in the ass for anybody that fights me, even though it's not that great.
[288:26.16]This is a huge pain in the ass.
[288:39.50]Okay, that's fine.
[288:40.10]Alright.
[288:45.36]Again.
[288:45.66]Oh, shit.
[288:48.32]Come on, turtle, turtle.
[288:49.32]I need the turtle.
[288:50.98]Nice.
[288:51.66]Very good.
[288:52.16]Okay.
[288:54.48]Oh, come on.
[288:55.16]Alright.
[289:13.46]Wait, before I do anything stupid.
[289:21.27]Level 2 turtle will give 2 armors.
[289:41.12]That doesn't really help me in this stupid build.
[289:44.14]Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[289:45.38]I think I'm gonna combine the hedgehogs and have two level 2 hedgehogs.
[290:01.16]Because... That's probably better.
[290:05.24]Don't do it yet.
[290:09.69]Do it in one more turn.
[290:12.59]Um...
[290:15.45]They'll kill you.
[290:16.97]You need honey.
[290:17.81]I actually do need honey, you're right, because they're going to kill everybody.
[290:21.54]I need to roll for honey.
[290:27.00]The monkey's cool, but not for this build.
[290:29.82]Honey.
[290:32.92]Oh.
[290:34.38]Wait a second.
[290:36.06]Wait a second.
[290:37.58]Excuse me?
[290:40.60]That's a big deal.
[290:49.78]Oh shit.
[290:52.33]Okay.
[291:00.23]Alright.
[291:01.59]Are we ready?
[291:02.05]I think we're ready.
[291:04.11]Oh, should the turtle go in the front to hit?
[291:09.43]Who should the turtle give it to?
[291:15.26]Ellen will cancel the garlic, so I need to give it to you.
[291:20.41]I want... Could the fish be in the back?
[291:27.61]The fish is going to die.
[291:28.41]I think that's alright.
[291:36.11]Alright, let's go.
[291:50.41]Did you do the Elmo voice?
[291:57.55]I woke up too early.
[291:58.25]I can't do it.
[291:58.65]Alright.
[292:07.43]Kill this guy in the front.
[292:12.33]I hit Melanon.
[292:13.69]Oh, it's 20 damage.
[292:14.35]No.
[292:22.47]It only blocks 20, that's right.
[292:31.02]Alright, this shithead build is not working out very well.
[292:41.09]I could just do two level 2 hedgehogs.
[292:55.69]What is that?
[292:56.28]Oh, Douglas.
[293:06.07]It's me, Mr. Dink.
[293:10.43]That's definitely going on one of these guys.
[293:33.87]End the stream now.
[293:34.69]No!
[293:38.89]This is just so stupid.
[293:39.87]It's going to do 8 damage and kill everybody.
[293:41.31]Who cares?
[293:41.69]It's funny.
[293:42.05]This is the last one anyways.
[293:53.82]It should be like this.
[293:58.14]I do have a reroll.
[293:58.88]That's right.
[294:04.97]Not enough to do anything interesting.
[294:06.73]I'm going to garlic.
[294:10.23]What do I do?
[294:11.69]Maybe just health on the turtle or something.
[294:15.11]Health on the tiger so he stays alive long enough to at least have this happen once.
[294:24.08]Or garlic on the... Garlic on the tiger.
[294:29.60]Otherwise, he'll just die.
[294:32.10]Then he'll take two from that.
[294:33.16]Alright.
[294:35.67]Well, this is going to be stupid.
[294:38.05]I get to do this one more time.
[294:42.09]Whop the hedgehogs.
[294:47.93]Okay.
[294:51.80]Alright, let's go.
[294:58.80]Oh, Jerma Tiger will die.
[295:05.72]Can you combine it for a level 3?
[295:07.32]Do two level 2s turn into a level 3?
[295:09.95]I don't know.
[295:10.31]I'm unaware of how that works.
[295:14.83]I mean, if it goes off, it kills everybody.
[295:18.91]Literally everybody dies.
[295:29.50]Oh man, it's gonna happen.
[295:32.28]Yeah, that's it.
[295:36.30]No, stupid boss!
[295:38.02]Oh shit!
[295:43.05]Alright, okay, please confirm with me.
[295:46.17]If I combine these two, does it make a level 3?
[295:48.27]Because doing 6 damage, doing 12 damage to everyone is kind of funny.
[295:59.11]I didn't get a... Oh.
[296:05.48]This is going to do six damage to everybody.
[296:07.06]I have to keep the tiger alive.
[296:25.17]12 with tiger, yeah.
[296:26.47]This is gonna be insane.
[296:28.25]Do another one?
[296:29.14]No, I don't think I want to.
[296:30.02]Alright, I gotta roll for like a melon or something for the tiger.
[296:35.32]Yeah.
[296:36.42]I need something else just to stay in the way.
[296:47.26]This has to hit two people.
[296:50.08]Put the turtle in front of the hog.
[296:56.53]So it'll protect the both of them, I guess.
[296:58.55]I don't know.
[297:00.32]Pufferfish could be interesting.
[297:02.72]Really late for it.
[297:08.60]It's just way too late for it.
[297:12.06]Pog2 is dumb.
[297:19.06]Alright.
[297:21.60]I mean, it's just, I could buff up the tiger.
[297:31.08]Do the rooster.
[297:33.44]They just die.
[297:35.92]And rooster in the back.
[297:40.74]I don't think the rooster is going to survive.
[297:43.18]It's 12 damage, guys.
[297:46.24]If this thing goes, everyone goes.
[297:52.80]All we're hoping for is it kills everything and then the chick pops up.
[297:56.59]Okay, right.
[297:57.17]That makes sense.
[297:59.37]Well, how's this for placement?
[298:01.03]I think that's as good as it's going to get.
[298:04.61]This is so stupid.
[298:10.65]Is this stupid enough to just ruin everybody's game and have me win games?
[298:18.13]Make sure the rooster's in front of the turtle.
[298:19.50]I want him to...
[298:27.67]Die after this?
[298:29.04]We'll see.
[298:30.14]No, I think this is fine like this.
[298:34.94]Rooster needs to be last, yeah.
[298:37.32]This is fine.
[298:40.42]Here we go.
[298:41.42]Good luck.
[298:46.71]Let's see how this works.
[298:47.73]Okay.
[298:54.05]Well, this is going to be an interesting scenario.
[298:59.47]Okay, fine.
[299:04.90]12 damage.
[299:05.76]Oh, no.
[299:06.40]Come on.
[299:08.14]Oh, shit.
[299:09.96]Oh, shit.
[299:13.32]Did I win?
[299:13.74]Oh, you have a dumbass porcupine.
[299:18.51]Okay, we're good.
[299:29.71]um what's the deal here do I just keep giving food to the uh the rooster just keep buffing the chicken like crazy rooster needs honey yeah
[300:05.40]Yeah, we need to roll for either another rooster.
[300:09.93]The cat is better than the fish.
[300:13.15]It is.
[300:13.45]Okay.
[300:16.81]The fish just has garlic on it.
[300:20.74]So we can put cat instead of fish and then feed the cat a bunch.
[300:25.12]Does the cat get the benefit from this?
[300:27.48]If all current and future shop heads 2-2, does that mean he's a 4-4?
[300:36.71]Before cat you feed anything okay, so it should be four four added Well that was wrong apparently because that's only a 1011 Okay It has to be purchased first well, we know we're doing this That's so cute Steak alright.
[301:02.46]It's like this is six six oh
[301:08.51]Do this and make the cat a 16, 17?
[301:15.50]Or do I cupcake the rooster instead?
[301:22.60]Make sure that there'll be at least 11 or 12 damage.
[301:25.68]Do the cow instead of who?
[301:31.52]Who do I get rid of?
[301:35.08]I mean, freeze the cow is a good idea, but remember, this is over if I die.
[301:40.95]Get rid of the turtle at this point.
[301:45.45]And just buy the food from the cow and just give it to the cat twice.
[301:49.65]So it'll be like a 20-20.
[302:01.62]Ludwig is stealing your strats.
[302:03.24]Heh.
[302:06.50]I think we feed... Yeah, I think we get rid of the turtle.
[302:09.60]We either give it to the cat... Or just... Just stuff the rooster full of milk.
[302:19.73]Well, let's do it.
[302:21.19]Let's go for it.
[302:21.71]Okay.
[302:23.75]Cow coming in.
[302:28.69]Wait.
[302:30.23]Cupcake.
[302:30.73]Wait.
[302:31.35]Cupcake.
[302:31.99]Cupcake to rooster.
[302:33.93]No, what do I do?
[302:35.05]Cupcake to cat.
[302:36.57]And then all milk to cat.
[302:37.93]This would be like a 30-30.
[302:38.77]Because it clears the items.
[302:46.75]Cupcake to cat, that means 16-17.
[302:50.11]Two milks is 8-8.
[302:52.06]17 plus 8 is like 25 or something.
[302:55.44]And it's not going to be like 25-25.
[302:58.48]It's free.
[302:59.08]The milk is free.
[302:59.66]I don't have enough money.
[303:01.56]Oh, okay.
[303:05.27]Alright, so what I'm doing is I'm putting the cow up.
[303:07.85]Cow's gonna get the milk.
[303:12.24]Milk is going to the cat or to the rooster?
[303:14.20]Probably the rooster, right?
[303:16.68]And then the cow's just gonna die.
[303:17.84]Everyone's gonna die.
[303:18.72]Who cares?
[303:22.12]Cat or rooster?
[303:22.92]I think the safe play is rooster because then he'll come back with another to be able to kill it.
[303:26.86]I mean, we'll have a really beefy cat, but I don't know if that's good enough.
[303:35.25]Boost the rooster.
[303:36.47]That'd be 4-4 or 8-8 to the cat.
[303:40.54]I don't know.
[303:40.98]I kind of want to see it to the cat.
[303:47.66]But hold on.
[303:48.28]Here's the thing.
[303:49.85]If I give it to the rooster, the rooster will survive the apocalypse.
[303:55.47]Because this is 12 damage.
[304:00.11]I think it has to be the rooster.
[304:05.22]Yeah, it has to be.
[304:09.16]The rooster now survives the apocalypse.
[304:17.80]In fact, I'm doing it again.
[304:22.52]Here we go.
[304:24.56]Last chance, let's roll.
[304:27.44]Oh, and you're going to show me a chocolate right now?
[304:29.28]Is that what you're going to do, really?
[304:30.24]Really?
[304:32.70]Really?
[304:38.45]Well, fuck it.
[304:39.07]Here we go.
[304:42.29]Let's go.
[304:43.52]I'm curious.
[304:50.22]Look at all these levels.
[304:51.10]You got a level... 17?
[304:52.70]19 damage?
[304:54.90]19 health?
[304:55.58]That's fine.
[304:57.30]No one's surviving the apocalypse.
[305:01.09]Oh, fuck.
[305:01.63]This is not good.
[305:04.67]It is good.
[305:04.99]I win.
[305:06.99]Do I win or is it a draw?
[305:07.91]Oh.
[305:10.56]Oh, it's a draw.
[305:12.78]Oh, shit.
[305:16.40]Oh, well.
[305:17.44]This looks so bad, but this is fun.
[305:19.24]Okay.
[305:23.82]Oh, god damn it.
[305:26.66]This is... I win every game now.
[305:30.06]I win every game.
[305:31.18]There's no way I lose another game after this.
[305:34.69]Mushroom on the rooster is... I guarantee to win every single game no matter what happens.
[305:47.78]Oh, wait a minute.
[305:49.78]Should it be on the Hedgehog?
[305:50.78]Because then the Hedgehog would come back and do 12, 6 damage again?
[305:54.65]Does it come back as a level 1?
[305:59.71]No, it just comes back as a 1, 1.
[306:01.87]Okay, so that would be bad.
[306:09.06]Chocolate the Cat.
[306:11.40]1 up the Hedgehog.
[306:13.41]It would still be level 3, so nobody will ever win.
[306:17.81]This would be horrible.
[306:19.57]Just do it for the nuke build.
[306:23.84]That's 18 damage.
[306:32.14]Somebody said feed the chocolate to the cat.
[306:36.47]Okay.
[306:39.47]Do it to the rooster.
[306:40.75]I need to make sure there's no survivors.
[306:45.71]Chocolate the rooster.
[306:47.42]Wait, so this... This is not just for the cat, this is for everybody up here.
[306:51.60]So if I give it to the rooster, it'll be level two, rooster.
[306:55.48]And the rooster will make two.
[306:57.96]Oh my god.
[307:00.96]Oh my god, that's good.
[307:03.24]That's... No one will ever win.
[307:05.98]I win every game.
[307:08.32]Don't do it?
[307:08.72]No, no, no, don't do it.
[307:09.72]Only works for one?
[307:11.55]It doesn't affect chocolate?
[307:13.33]What?
[307:14.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[307:16.21]Roll first.
[307:16.61]Wait, what do you mean?
[307:17.63]It doesn't work?
[307:18.19]It's health and attack only.
[307:21.77]Oh.
[307:21.89]Alright, well, I'm giving the mushroom to the hedgehog because who cares?
[307:29.72]It's over.
[307:31.54]Who gives a shit?
[307:36.18]So now I'm looking for another cow.
[307:38.44]Yeah.
[307:41.06]Yeah.
[307:45.30]Does fly help me?
[307:46.30]I don't think so.
[307:47.50]Not at this stage.
[307:50.75]Unless I put him behind the rooster?
[307:55.17]Sushi's not bad here, no.
[308:03.74]Just use the sushi.
[308:07.82]Fly's just gonna die?
[308:08.66]That's true.
[308:09.16]Okay.
[308:14.08]I would love another cow.
[308:21.52]Sell cow and get the bison.
[308:26.54]Yeah, that's not a bad idea either.
[308:27.83]2-2 every time.
[308:30.25]Alright, I'm going to roll once.
[308:37.39]I'm going to freeze this guy because I think that's a good idea.
[308:42.13]We get one roll and we can sell.
[308:44.59]Let's see what happens.
[308:50.72]Oh well.
[308:59.72]Okay, so this is level three.
[309:02.12]I really need to... There's no defense back here.
[309:08.15]Alright, let's do it.
[309:09.05]It's time to... This is going to be stupid.
[309:12.65]Let's go.
[309:21.52]Defense is unnecessary because of the nuke, yeah.
[309:25.38]All I can tell you right now, this could be really bad.
[309:33.94]Mmm.
[309:36.15]Mmm.
[309:36.91]Okay.
[309:37.35]Here we go.
[309:42.35]Okay.
[309:43.81]Do it again.
[309:44.31]That's a win.
[309:49.40]We're never going to lose another game again.
[309:55.16]You just have to lose every time until you get level 3 hedgehog and a mushroom.
[310:02.78]The goal now is to try to get these upgraded.
[310:10.92]Okay, so... I could do cupcake on the cat.
[310:18.68]Chocolate on the tiger, that doesn't do anything.
[310:21.80]Upgrade the rooster, fuck the tiger.
[310:23.30]Yeah, the tiger- upgrades don't do anything on the tiger.
[310:28.58]We're looking for a rooster.
[310:34.40]So I'm gonna use chocolate on the rooster.
[310:36.18]And then we need to find a rooster.
[310:40.82]It's so important to find a rooster right now.
[310:43.02]I'm just gonna roll till I find one.
[310:48.15]Not a rooster.
[310:50.43]It is a bison though.
[310:53.51]Oh shit, can I do this twice?
[310:56.35]Wait, hold on.
[310:58.97]Hold on.
[311:00.05]What if... I mushroom the tiger?
[311:09.62]So then it would be 12 damage again.
[311:17.35]This is literally impossible to beat.
[311:27.36]I don't think there's a meta in this game that could beat Level 3 Hedgehog, Mushroomed, Mushroomed Tiger.
[311:37.32]I will always at least have one character left.
[311:41.76]Unless they have something in the back.
[311:45.11]It won't work?
[311:47.17]Why not?
[311:51.99]It will be dead.
[311:53.73]Well, this blows up.
[311:54.57]This does 12 damage.
[311:55.49]It comes back.
[311:57.57]And then... It does it again?
[312:02.65]Because it has to die.
[312:03.54]Because this has to die.
[312:05.26]So when it comes back, it'll die.
[312:07.48]And then this will come back and then do it.
[312:09.70]Yeah, this should work.
[312:11.00]Let's just do it.
[312:11.60]Who cares?
[312:11.96]And then we're going to give... We'll give splash damage to the bison.
[312:25.68]Fine.
[312:27.14]Okay.
[312:27.82]Good luck.
[312:34.86]I have no idea what's going to happen, but it might be funny.
[312:40.77]Oh, you're going to get wiped out, buddy.
[312:42.89]You're going to get wiped out.
[312:44.05]You have no idea.
[312:44.71]You're going to get wiped out.
[312:45.65]Oh, no.
[312:49.68]What happened?
[312:50.58]What am I going to do now?
[312:57.28]It's going to work.
[312:58.18]It's going to work.
[313:00.30]Oh, God.
[313:03.91]Wait, it didn't work?
[313:06.47]Wait, why did that not work?
[313:13.13]Why not?
[313:15.77]Come on, are you kidding me?
[313:24.42]I win.
[313:25.86]Oh my god.
[313:26.98]No, that's what I was gonna do.
[313:27.98]Don't relax, it's fine.
[313:37.68]So, I think it's just pizza.
[313:40.00]Tiger doesn't really do anything.
[313:44.49]Bee and pizza.
[313:46.15]Bee on the rooster.
[313:50.89]Rooster honey.
[313:55.79]Rooster honey.
[313:56.39]Yeah, because then it would be, yeah, it's over.
[314:00.20]Honey on the rooster for sure.
[314:03.34]Then we get a pizza.
[314:06.41]Oh man, oh man, it's over.
[314:08.31]I am... I'm gonna come back from the dead here.
[314:11.05]I was at one heart.
[314:12.64]I'm gonna win all eight of these games in a row.
[314:14.84]I don't think there's anything else I do.
[314:22.76]I think just roll for food.
[314:31.45]Which, that's a pretty good... That's pretty good.
[314:33.59]I'll keep this one.
[314:35.25]Good luck.
[314:40.60]This is just crazy enough, I think, to carry us the whole way.
[314:43.56]As long as I can keep that rooster alive.
[314:46.54]Oh boy, that's very bad.
[314:48.12]I don't think this is going to play out.
[314:50.34]Now I'm actually kind of scared.
[314:52.68]It's not enough.
[314:54.04]Is it not enough?
[314:56.58]Shit, it's not enough.
[315:03.52]Oh, it's not enough.
[315:04.94]He's going to kill everybody.
[315:07.24]No!
[315:10.23]Oh, what the hell?
[315:11.45]That was fun.
[315:14.41]Now it's over.
[315:20.72]How do you get a 50-50 goose?
[315:22.54]That doesn't make any sense.
[315:23.28]How do you get a 50-50 goose?
[315:26.96]How does that happen?
[315:27.62]Alright, no, that's it, that's it.
[315:35.18]This is only supposed to be like a stream that was like an hour long.
[315:38.84]I'll see you guys this weekend.
[315:41.22]It was fun playing.
[315:42.72]If anything, this tournament, even though I lost every game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing, this is really fun.
[315:49.22]I like this a lot.
[315:52.62]Thanks, Ludwig, for the invite.
[315:53.70]I'll do better next time.
[316:01.12]I'll see you guys this weekend, either Friday or Sunday.
[316:02.76]I'm going to see what Alex is up to.
[316:08.13]See what day probably works better.
[316:10.01]So I'll see you soon.
[316:15.03]That was Super Auto Pets.
[316:17.27]And that was a lot of fun.
[316:20.23]Take care of yourselves.
[316:23.31]We can run the credits though.
[316:25.05]How long?
[316:25.33]This stream is way longer than I thought it was.
[316:31.35]Is Ludwig still streaming?
[316:34.98]Like, what the fuck just happened?
[316:42.10]Let me see.
[316:42.73]Yeah, we'll go raid Ludwig.
[316:47.07]Playing auto-pads, right?
[316:48.77]Go say hello.
[316:50.09]Say, thanks for the invite.
[316:54.22]And I will see you guys later.
[316:58.03]Thanks for coming.
[316:59.45]Thanks to all the subs.
[317:01.15]See you guys this weekend.
[317:03.34]We can start the raid.
[317:08.88]Raid?
[317:09.28]I don't even know how many people are here.
[317:12.08]I haven't even looked the whole time.
[317:16.74]Was that fun to watch?
[317:17.54]Because it was fun to play.
[317:18.38]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[317:26.05]Take care.
[317:35.88]By the way, the game is free.
[317:38.45]It's $5 to get the DLC pets.
[317:41.47]Which I mean, like, really?
[317:43.73]It's like $4.99 or something.
[317:45.27]Take care of yourselves.
[317:49.06]See you guys soon.
[317:50.48]Have a great rest of your night.
[317:55.96]And goodbye.
