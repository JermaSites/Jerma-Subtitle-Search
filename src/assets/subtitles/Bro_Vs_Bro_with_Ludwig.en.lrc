[ve:61.7.100]

[00:04.72]Hey, good afternoon.
[00:06.88]How are you?
[00:09.56]How have you been?
[00:10.72]Good?
[00:12.34]Good.
[00:13.26]Excellent.
[00:14.38]It's very good to hear.
[00:15.36]Today's a very special day.
[00:18.31]Today, I'm going to be doing bro versus bro with Ludwig.
[00:26.75]Yes, I'm very aware of our previous bets that we had.
[00:32.97]I'm sure those are going to be addressed on camera.
[00:38.18]It'll be a fun day after that.
[00:42.38]After Bro vs. Bro.
[00:43.34]Need to do a tweet?
[00:46.20]I will.
[00:49.77]We're gonna jump back into Elden Ring.
[00:52.89]I don't think this is gonna take more than... Two hours?
[00:59.49]So right when we say goodbye to Ludwig, we're gonna hop into Elden Ring.
[01:04.51]And go for it.
[01:07.01]See if I can get to the end.
[01:09.79]He's addicted.
[01:10.57]I wanna play it!
[01:11.49]I gotta call Ludwig, by the way.
[01:15.09]I'm gonna give him a buzz in a second here.
[01:21.50]One sec!
[01:23.76]Aha, bro versus bo- bro, you know!
[01:28.62]The competition between two bros.
[01:33.09]We each pick a few games that we know that we're pretty good at.
[01:38.13]Or activities.
[01:40.53]And we compete.
[01:42.37]Whoever wins has to tweet themselves out in a Mega Milk shirt, right?
[01:50.52]Let me tell you something.
[01:51.60]From now on, bets are going to be very, very benign and boring.
[01:59.60]No more like, oh, you're gonna take your shirt off and drink milk upside down while you shit your pants and tweet it.
[02:05.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:08.49]How about like, I don't know, how about like donate to church?
[02:15.17]How about like, hold a note for five seconds.
[02:19.53]That's like such, no, it can't be like that.
[02:22.17]It can't be like, that's like Nickelodeon.
[02:26.87]How long can you hold the note for?
[02:28.37]Like, oh wow, you did it for five seconds.
[02:31.31]That was worth it.
[02:31.89]Fuck church.
[02:40.21]I just, I'm not saying donate to church, I'm just saying, like, just, I used a random noun, okay?
[02:49.28]That was the first noun that popped up in my head.
[02:52.92]I haven't been to church in probably like fucking 15 years or something, guys.
[02:57.84]I don't know.
[02:58.22]He's a heretic.
[03:04.39]Which way do you want it?
[03:05.99]Religious streamer or not religious streamer, huh?
[03:11.83]Let me tell you something.
[03:13.77]Aliens dropped us off.
[03:15.80]Aliens dropped us off in a fucking care package here, okay?
[03:19.24]Sorry to blow everybody's mind here on this.
[03:24.72]Let's see what Ludwig has to say about that.
[03:32.24]You good?
[03:37.92]Heretic.
[03:42.34]I don't know.
[03:42.90]Who knows?
[03:43.68]You don't know?
[03:44.89]Nobody knows anything.
[03:48.27]We could be amorphous blobs that evolved.
[03:53.54]Or some alien could have shot a fucking cannon out into the galaxy and we just ended up here.
[04:06.58]Start your stream.
[04:07.84]No, you said start your religion.
[04:08.94]I don't know why I said start your stream.
[04:24.20]Are you Amish?
[04:30.01]What does Amish have to- wait.
[04:31.97]What are you talking about?
[04:32.73]What does Amish have to do with that?
[04:37.00]Amish people don't believe that aliens shot us out of a cannon.
[04:42.90]Why are you saying Amish?
[04:57.31]He's streaming from rocks and twigs.
[05:00.71]I am not, actually.
[05:09.54]You're an alien?
[05:11.48]I don't know what the hell we are.
[05:16.87]Millions of years of cells that have evolved.
[05:22.08]But why?
[05:23.64]You know?
[05:24.38]Okay, we're getting way too into this now.
[05:26.84]Let's bro versus bro with Ludwig, right?
[05:30.39]We don't have to ask the why.
[05:32.57]We don't start a bro versus bro stream.
[05:35.73]Or start asking questions about humanity.
[05:38.28]And why we're here.
[05:41.60]Should we throw Ludwig a curveball?
[05:43.80]Right when he answers the phone.
[05:46.32]Why are we here?
[05:46.82]That's what he says.
[05:55.46]Why are we here?
[05:57.22]Ludwig.
[05:59.14]You know Ludwig.
[05:59.70]He'll be like, oh, play bro versus bro, of course.
[06:06.37]And then he'll go into the intro.
[06:08.71]God damn, is it a good intro.
[06:14.75]That's the thing.
[06:15.21]A lot of people, you don't understand.
[06:17.65]A good intro is a huge deal.
[06:22.71]If you got a catchy intro on YouTube, huge fucking deal.
[06:27.11]Guaranteed, guaranteed success.
[06:30.07]For instance, I'll give you an example.
[06:32.43]Hello, everybody.
[06:33.11]Welcome to Team Fortress 2.
[06:36.50]My name is Joe.
[06:37.08]I don't even know how I can do my own intro.
[06:41.24]What is this?
[06:42.94]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:45.09]What is it?
[06:45.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[06:46.49]I've heard JermaCraft so many times.
[06:48.03]Hey, what's going on?
[06:49.97]I got it, I got it.
[06:50.45]Hey, what's going on, buddy?
[06:51.86]Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[06:56.12]I would, right?
[06:56.66]You know what I'm saying?
[07:07.68]He never left.
[07:09.92]He still got it.
[07:12.53]It's so weird to think that that was so that long ago.
[07:17.19]It's weird because that feels so long ago, but it feels like it was a week ago at the same time.
[07:21.35]Like, when I think back to when I was 25, I was like 24, 25.
[07:28.28]I feel like I'm so, like, it's so long ago.
[07:30.86]Yeah.
[07:31.98]Yeah.
[07:46.54]Team Fortress 2.
[07:47.26]Alright.
[07:53.05]I think... we are... I didn't even tweet.
[07:56.05]Fuck.
[07:56.47]Did I?
[07:57.37]No, I didn't.
[07:57.79]Hold on.
[08:02.25]Let me tweet.
[08:02.71]I'm gonna say... Bro versus Bro.
[08:08.06]Bro versus Bro.
[08:13.62]Happening now.
[08:16.60]Bro versus, should it be bro versus bro versus Ludwig?
[08:20.12]No, that makes it sound like there's three people.
[08:29.60]You're pretending to be young?
[08:33.26]I don't think so.
[08:33.94]I think you guys call me out on old dated shit that I say all the time.
[08:41.61]I get question marks for references on TV shows that are like 6 or 7 plus years old.
[08:47.32]We're not talking 30 years ago, we're talking like references that are like 5 to 10 years ago.
[08:53.08]That's how I know I'm old.
[09:02.57]Yeah, I made an Andy Griffith reference, and nobody got that, which was annoying.
[09:08.24]That wasn't that long ago, that was like... 70 or 80 years ago.
[09:16.12]Alright, bro versus bro... Against... Ludwig.
[09:20.60]No, that makes it sound like it's a tag team against Ludwig.
[09:23.32]How do I say this?
[09:26.49]With Ludwig.
[09:29.31]No, that makes it sound like that Ludwig is like an accessory to that stream.
[09:32.53]Not like it's not me versus Ludwig.
[09:33.93]How do I say this?
[09:36.39]Featuring.
[09:36.95]How about starring?
[09:41.69]Starring's kind of better, isn't it?
[09:42.99]Bro vs. Bro, starring Ludwig.
[09:48.49]That's so... That's so boring.
[09:53.84]With special... No, I'm the guest today.
[09:59.26]This is Ludwig's Bro vs. Bro.
[10:02.06]I'm a participant.
[10:03.94]How about bro versus bro, let's go.
[10:05.62]That's easy.
[10:06.00]Okay, that's fine.
[10:07.94]And I'm going to add Ludwig.
[10:08.84]Yeah, that's fine.
[10:18.59]And remember, it's on twitch.tv.
[10:24.73]Ludwig's currently trying to set up one of the games that we're going to play.
[10:29.11]I'm going to just chill for a little bit.
[10:31.83]Don't worry, today's going to be a long one.
[10:35.57]like I said after we are done with bro versus bro I'm gonna go into Elden Ring and be a long one I don't know if it's gonna be too long but it'll be long enough okay there we go yeah there that's a good tweet how are you
[11:00.28]Yeah, so I think how this is going to work, like I said, we both picked three games, right?
[11:05.66]So we both have three games that we have chosen.
[11:10.06]I can tell you my games.
[11:12.24]And it's depending on if Ludwig can get one to work.
[11:15.79]We might have to pivot to something else, one of the neutral games.
[11:19.03]Should I leak it?
[11:22.19]Did he leak it?
[11:24.17]Did he already talk about it?
[11:28.82]He didn't.
[11:29.60]He didn't?
[11:29.96]Okay.
[11:30.50]He did.
[11:30.80]He already leaked it.
[11:35.18]He leaked it?
[11:35.56]Okay.
[11:39.42]Well, if he leaked it, then whatever.
[11:40.66]We can just talk about it.
[11:47.79]He said House Flipper and battleship.
[11:50.27]Yeah, we were trying to figure out how to do House Flipper, um...
[11:56.90]Competition and I was thinking is we both have to pick the same small house and Flip it in like 10 like 15 minutes And whoever has the cooler house wins.
[12:09.02]I Don't know how we would vote on that though We just do we just look like do a walkthrough of each other's houses and just be like, yeah, dude you won Whoever has most sale price That's true.
[12:20.37]But the problem with sale price and house flippers.
[12:22.05]It feels really random.
[12:23.41]I
[12:25.42]It feels incredibly random.
[12:27.90]So it could be... I'm not sure.
[12:30.54]Do we need a neutral party to come in?
[12:39.88]Do we have... I wonder if we can... Can we get a neutral party to look?
[12:43.54]That'd be kind of funny.
[12:47.42]Yeah, I have another couple games too.
[12:49.66]And one of them, by the way... Oh, I am... I'm locked in to be the victor.
[12:55.39]Like, it's almost guaranteed.
[12:58.33]I know this because Ludwig didn't even know what this game was until three days ago.
[13:04.07]I've got, like, a decade of experience in this game.
[13:07.26]He didn't even know what the game was 48 hours ago.
[13:15.74]It's over on that one, okay?
[13:18.04]I picked that one to make sure that I could at least win one game.
[13:36.47]Among Us?
[13:36.89]Why would I play?
[13:37.63]I have no experience in Among Us.
[13:39.10]Why would I play Among Us?
[13:44.60]And then I got another one that I have heard that he's pretty good at.
[13:50.02]But I don't know.
[13:50.90]I don't know in the scenario that he'll be put in if he's going to be alright.
[13:57.67]I have a lot of experience with this particular thing too.
[14:09.65]We need a face cam.
[14:10.39]Oh, there'll be a face cam today.
[14:11.61]Oh, yeah.
[14:14.50]You betcha, as they say.
[14:15.82]You betcha.
[14:18.86]Let's turn the intro music down.
[14:23.60]That's better.
[14:25.80]We're just chilling.
[14:27.39]Oh, hold on.
[14:29.31]Hold on.
[14:29.93]I'm getting a phone call.
[14:33.11]Hello?
[14:34.11]Hello, Jerma.
[14:35.37]Hi, how are you?
[14:37.51]Doing quite well, in fact.
[14:39.29]Good, good.
[14:40.21]Did you, uh, did you do all, did you get, was it settled?
[14:44.35]Oh, settled a while ago.
[14:45.71]Oh, settled, okay.
[14:46.53]I had something else come up.
[14:47.53]Yeah, I figured that out a while ago.
[14:48.85]Oh, alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, alright.
[14:50.96]So, should be all set.
[14:52.20]Should be all set to do any house flipping at all.
[14:55.96]Ooh, so did you leak what we were doing?
[14:59.54]No, no, I meant that, no.
[15:01.68]I meant house flipping, like, generally, like, flipping things in your life.
[15:05.06]Mixing things up.
[15:06.87]Oh, I leaked.
[15:08.51]Okay.
[15:09.75]That's good.
[15:11.64]Because I think maybe I left breadcrumbs.
[15:13.70]You know, people got there.
[15:14.60]Yeah.
[15:14.96]Alright.
[15:16.42]Yeah.
[15:17.02]Let's leak away.
[15:17.76]I don't think I've said all the games.
[15:19.06]You want to leak?
[15:20.38]Yeah.
[15:20.88]No.
[15:21.04]Go ahead and leak.
[15:22.16]Let's go.
[15:22.66]Let's leak.
[15:24.07]Okay.
[15:25.11]Guys, this is the surprise.
[15:27.93]We're playing Bro vs. Bro with several games, Jerma.
[15:31.07]There's four.
[15:32.43]There's four.
[15:32.97]You know this, right?
[15:33.67]You know how it works.
[15:34.67]There's four games.
[15:36.50]What's the word?
[15:37.20]Games that we're both good at?
[15:38.98]Neutral.
[15:40.66]What are the neutral games?
[15:43.26]Well, one is one that you, I want to say, invented.
[15:46.08]Really?
[15:47.80]Hasbro's Battleship.
[15:48.66]That's the one.
[15:49.18]I know that one.
[15:50.66]Amen.
[15:51.26]Amen.
[15:51.82]You made that game.
[15:53.63]That's always the starter for Bro vs. Bro.
[15:56.13]I try to keep it alive.
[15:59.07]And then the other neutral games are Rock, Paper, Scissors.
[16:03.75]Oh, shit.
[16:07.33]That one?
[16:07.83]That one gave you the oh shit?
[16:09.39]I mean, that's... I'm actually kind of nervous about that one.
[16:13.30]I feel like that... Okay, yeah.
[16:15.36]I guess, you know, you're right.
[16:16.30]Rock does beat scissors.
[16:17.20]That gets stressful.
[16:18.74]Because it's so easy to lose or win that game.
[16:21.36]Yeah, because, I mean, you know.
[16:23.48]But I think you have a good chance at all of these.
[16:25.84]Next one is Connect 4, neutral game.
[16:28.91]Okay.
[16:30.40]Why are you laughing?
[16:31.28]It sounds like you have a history with Kinect 4.
[16:33.24]No, it's just that I'm glad that these are this simple.
[16:37.06]Because I was concerned to be like, oh, yeah, we're going to hop into Fortnite.
[16:39.88]It's going to be 1v1.
[16:41.06]Oh, yeah.
[16:41.94]No items, you know.
[16:44.60]Just absolutely imbalanced and just destroy you in games you've never played.
[16:49.07]Yeah.
[16:50.09]Yeah, I tried to make it balanced because I realized that you haven't played many games on stream that came out after 1999.
[16:56.68]That's very true.
[16:58.80]So, you know.
[17:00.86]And by the way, the last, like, whole month, I've only played Elden Ring.
[17:04.02]It's the only game I play.
[17:05.58]Yeah.
[17:06.34]Well, and the last neutral one is, of course, Getting Over It by Bennett Foddy.
[17:11.41]And how long do you, how long each one of these games gonna take?
[17:14.37]We doing like 15 to 20 minutes, 30 minutes?
[17:16.73]What's your timeframe?
[17:18.56]Usually, so it's, we just play each game and it takes like about, like Battleship's just a best of one.
[17:24.14]It takes about like 20 minutes.
[17:25.44]Connect Four is like maybe a best of three.
[17:27.26]It takes like five, 10 minutes.
[17:28.92]Rock Paper Scissors shoots like a couple minutes.
[17:30.49]So it depends on the game.
[17:31.37]And Getting Over, it's about six to 12 hours.
[17:34.21]Yeah, yeah.
[17:36.09]Well, the good news is I'm actually a pro speedrunner at it and I have a five minute time, but...
[17:39.51]That's not neutral then.
[17:41.39]You seem like you're talented.
[17:42.61]Neutral?
[17:43.15]No, because you have a great way of handling anger.
[17:47.96]And I think that's why this is a good game that you might have a good chance in.
[17:52.78]You know what?
[17:53.94]Okay.
[17:54.44]I don't think that's a neutral experience.
[17:56.16]Sensing a little tension.
[17:58.20]Let's pivot.
[17:59.12]Okay.
[17:59.30]We'll pivot to something more balanced.
[18:01.70]How about just reaction speed?
[18:05.00]That works.
[18:05.40]Because one of the games that I picked is, of course...
[18:10.73]Click speed.
[18:12.55]Is that what?
[18:13.31]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[18:13.86]Click speed.
[18:14.66]Okay.
[18:15.78]How fast you can click your mouse in 10 seconds.
[18:17.86]I think I got you on that one.
[18:19.12]I think I do.
[18:19.56]Yeah.
[18:20.36]No, do you have history in that?
[18:23.10]Like clicking fast?
[18:24.82]Oh, yeah.
[18:26.30]And I know you do, too.
[18:28.52]A light amount.
[18:29.76]This is with a mouse though, right?
[18:31.40]This is with a mouse.
[18:32.10]This is not with a controller.
[18:33.00]Yeah, it changes it a bit.
[18:34.46]That changes it a bit.
[18:35.34]It does.
[18:36.27]The dynamic changes when you have to have a hand on your desk.
[18:39.89]Wait, is that a... So I can't lift the mouse?
[18:42.47]No, you cannot hold the mouse in your hand and cradle it like a baby and sit there like that.
[18:46.91]No, it's got to be... You can use two hands.
[18:49.75]You can't use your hands.
[18:50.89]The mouse needs to be on your desk.
[18:52.95]Okay, and it's just left-clicking, right?
[18:54.79]Yes, left-clicking.
[18:55.98]Okay, just clip.
[18:56.82]Okay.
[18:57.20]Am I going to get destroyed?
[18:58.26]Wait, everyone in my chat is saying I'm going to get fucking destroyed.
[19:00.82]I'm going to get destroyed?
[19:02.02]No, no.
[19:03.56]When you told me this game, I was excited for you because I knew you'd do really well.
[19:07.56]I mean, I'm like about 14 plus 15 clicks a second.
[19:10.97]Like, I'm an absolute maniac at that.
[19:14.59]People say I'm fucked.
[19:15.75]Wow, 15.
[19:16.91]That's really good.
[19:18.11]And that's because it's a lot.
[19:19.83]It's a lot of clicks in a second.
[19:23.51]Why does he sound so confident?
[19:24.59]Like way too confident.
[19:26.42]I think 15 is impressive.
[19:28.30]I think that beats most children.
[19:31.76]Yeah, but you can't hold it in your arms and like it's got to be on the table.
[19:38.88]Probably most like teachers would lose to you in this 1v1.
[19:44.04]Alright.
[19:44.54]Alright.
[19:45.44]I'm ready.
[19:45.92]I'm ready.
[19:46.38]I'm ready to compete.
[19:47.24]I'm ready to compete.
[19:47.88]Okay.
[19:48.10]Yeah.
[19:48.32]Great.
[19:48.48]Great.
[19:48.82]And you have a couple more games.
[19:49.88]Do you want to reveal them as we go?
[19:51.27]Or do you want to just... I'm going to fucking lose it.
[19:53.69]Hopefully the RNG works in my favor in Battleship because I ain't going to win any of these.
[19:57.85]Well, the good news is it's first to five.
[19:59.89]So you can't just win off your own games or even like four games.
[20:04.19]You have to win five.
[20:05.17]So we have to win some of the neutrals.
[20:06.79]Okay.
[20:07.57]That sounds good.
[20:08.57]We can reveal the games as we go.
[20:10.27]Let's just kick off with a bit of Battleship.
[20:12.27]Yeah, let's do Battleship.
[20:13.55]Do I have to be online on Steam for this?
[20:16.26]Oh, yeah, you do.
[20:17.34]Do I?
[20:17.56]Okay, that's easy.
[20:19.02]It's actually phenomenal because I just went offline.
[20:21.52]Yeah, I start every single day and offline.
[20:24.66]Wait, why?
[20:25.14]I don't know.
[20:26.46]I just always want to be offline.
[20:28.09]People give me shit for this all the time.
[20:29.27]You know that?
[20:30.58]I'm never online.
[20:31.62]I'm never online on Discord.
[20:32.84]I'm never online on Battle.net.
[20:34.24]I'm never online on Steam.
[20:35.60]Always permanently offline.
[20:36.94]Permanently.
[20:38.03]I switched to being permanently offline in Discord.
[20:41.54]really well people would judge me like I'd come to stream the day after and they'd be like oh wow ludwig three hours last night playing Jump King you know I'd be like oh yeah I I don't yeah I don't want people to see my my like my history of me playing like 500 hours of lost ark no no don't tell me that's a meme right it is a meme but I'm just saying alright alright I'd be concerned for you is there a way to leak it to just each other
[21:10.69]What, your history?
[21:12.25]Yeah, like, can you be offline, but, like, show it to friends on Steam?
[21:16.11]Maybe.
[21:16.45]I think so.
[21:17.51]I don't know.
[21:18.69]Dude, I've... I, like, privated my Steam profile, like, a half decade ago, and I don't even know how to turn it off.
[21:25.91]I have no idea how to even turn it back on.
[21:27.31]So, I have no fucking idea.
[21:30.27]I almost forgot.
[21:31.31]We have to figure out what we're playing for.
[21:34.58]Yeah, okay, so this is where it gets weird, because we had a competition a long time ago, and you won, and I had to do a series of things that never happened.
[21:46.34]I can't even remember.
[21:48.29]It was like a cartoon list of things.
[21:49.85]Yeah, it was like a Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck cartoon list of weird shit that I had to do.
[21:54.79]Uh-huh.
[21:55.85]One of them was to take a picture outside a fucking room with a Mega Milk shirt on with delivering milk.
[22:04.48]Yeah, I think you need to, like, get milked and then deliver the milk in a milk costume and then also go to, like, a casino and wager, like, $500.
[22:11.02]No, dude, it was $1,500.
[22:11.68]It was a lot.
[22:12.12]You know what?
[22:12.44]Let's just say it was $500.
[22:13.26]That's easy.
[22:18.70]Yeah, it was a lot.
[22:19.80]It was a lot.
[22:21.60]How do I verify that?
[22:22.80]You can't, like, videotape in a casino.
[22:24.87]I couldn't have, like, how do I verify?
[22:26.07]You would have to, like, be there physically to, like, watch it.
[22:28.29]Yeah.
[22:29.27]I think this is this.
[22:30.09]Okay.
[22:30.97]Look, I will.
[22:32.05]Because that's in a video.
[22:33.71]There's evidence of the cartoon list.
[22:36.35]I'll just eventually go to you and then bring all the effects.
[22:40.85]And then I can verify it like a Guinness Book of World Records judge.
[22:45.41]So if you win today.
[22:49.83]It's going to be like in those Disney movies where the guy lifts up the parchment and the thing hits the floor and he's like, Sire, this is what you need to do today.
[22:57.83]It's got like, what are you going to have me do?
[23:00.10]What else could you have me possibly do?
[23:02.46]I think at a certain point, it's just I just go over to you and I just have a week where I get my way.
[23:09.16]You want my like stream key for like two days or something?
[23:12.70]Yeah.
[23:13.14]Yeah.
[23:13.76]Yeah.
[23:14.02]We're getting there.
[23:14.86]We're getting there, you know.
[23:18.62]Take my stream key for one hour.
[23:21.18]Maybe we keep this one simple then, right?
[23:23.18]It doesn't add to the list.
[23:24.50]It's just something nice, but concrete.
[23:27.96]Yeah, like... Like donating to your local church.
[23:36.60]I already do that so much.
[23:38.46]You should have seen my face.
[23:39.22]I was smiling ear to ear.
[23:42.63]That was a joke from my chat.
[23:44.13]They all hate me.
[23:46.27]For donating to your local church?
[23:47.83]No, because we went back and forth about how I was like, let's make it easy.
[23:50.96]Like, I don't want to, like, stand on my head and drink milk with, like, my ass cheeks showing.
[23:55.06]Like, let's just say, oh, like, donate to something.
[23:57.48]And I was like, donate to, I don't know, like, church.
[23:59.26]And people were like, church?
[23:59.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[24:01.38]Is that what you expect from me?
[24:03.18]Like, something that depraved?
[24:06.02]To stand on your head and then drink, like, ass-drink milk?
[24:10.49]Well, I mean, wasn't one of the original things that I was up to show up in, like, a sexy maid outfit and deliver milk to your house?
[24:16.77]Like, that's a little... That's way different.
[24:19.68]Now you're conflating the two.
[24:20.82]You're bloviating.
[24:21.56]That one's normal.
[24:22.52]That's, like, almost... It's, like, a common request from people these days.
[24:26.54]I've been asked to do that a lot.
[24:27.53]I can't believe you haven't been... Boofing milk is obviously worse than that.
[24:30.05]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[24:32.51]Alright, I believe I am on Steam now.
[24:35.87]Should I join or... What are you guys talking about?
[24:38.25]This is bro versus bro, man!
[24:41.29]Just bros being bros, alright?
[24:42.69]Talking about... Just bros talking.
[24:44.15]Talking about maids and milk, okay?
[24:45.57]What do you want, man?
[24:46.30]What are bros supposed to talk about these days?
[24:47.70]Alright, so join... Do you want to host it or should I host it?
[24:51.10]Yeah, yeah, I'll host.
[24:51.92]I'll send you... Do you want to play on a fancy board or a simple board?
[24:55.66]That's up to you.
[24:57.96]I usually let the guests decide, but... Let's do it.
[25:00.30]Let's... Because this is just best of one, right?
[25:01.82]We're just playing this.
[25:02.40]Yes.
[25:03.16]Just one.
[25:04.32]Let's do fancy.
[25:04.96]Let's go fancy.
[25:06.00]Okay.
[25:06.16]Alright.
[25:06.50]I'm going to do hole in the middle.
[25:08.19]Oh, don't... Yeah.
[25:10.89]It sounds like you immediately hated that.
[25:12.81]That's the one... You kicked my ass on that one before.
[25:14.93]Did I?
[25:15.25]Yeah.
[25:15.83]It was bad.
[25:16.05]I think I kicked your ass on...
[25:18.18]I mean, I don't mean to be rude.
[25:19.30]I kicked your ass on every single one of them.
[25:20.86]Well, Ludwig, this is rude, and then this is factual.
[25:23.48]Okay.
[25:25.25]You can go ahead and be factual.
[25:26.17]Alright, great.
[25:27.35]Great, great, great.
[25:28.51]Okay, so play with friends.
[25:29.35]I'm going to join game.
[25:30.03]I'm not showing.
[25:30.57]I'm not leaking.
[25:32.13]An old wager I used to do is that the loser would give the winner a pair of their shoes.
[25:38.94]Okay.
[25:39.34]What size are you?
[25:39.86]11.
[25:39.88]Okay.
[25:42.60]Uh, I'm like 10.
[25:43.94]It wasn't to wear, it was more so for like, it's not like I needed an extra pair.
[25:47.34]Oh, I thought you wanted to wear, I don't know.
[25:49.84]No, I had a dream where it's like pink slips and I'd hang them up on the rafters and it would just be all like the carcasses of the foes I've slain.
[25:57.67]I thought it was just like, dude, let me take a look at your like shoe collection and see what you got.
[26:02.27]You got anything cool?
[26:03.91]And by the way, I don't.
[26:05.27]Yeah, they're like bands, they're like slip-ons usually, right?
[26:08.26]You don't...
[26:09.46]Ludwig, five out of the six pairs of shoes that I have are house flippers.
[26:14.77]Like, house flip slippers.
[26:16.47]They're house flippers.
[26:18.05]House flippers.
[26:20.21]They're fucking very basic.
[26:22.31]I don't have shoes, man.
[26:24.62]I really don't.
[26:25.40]I have, like, one pair of sneakers.
[26:27.84]I have about eight pairs of Crocs, and that's about it.
[26:31.56]Yeah, that's right.
[26:32.34]You do have a lot of Crocs.
[26:33.42]Alright, what's the code?
[26:36.35]Do you want to?
[26:36.97]It's in the chat.
[26:37.43]It's in the chat.
[26:39.45]Okay, now I'm not going to leak.
[26:41.11]No.
[26:41.41]Okay, not leaking.
[26:42.69]You can show the screen now, yeah.
[26:44.99]Alright.
[26:46.50]I think this is a good setup.
[26:49.02]Is there a champ?
[26:50.70]Do you want a neutral champ or do you want to go our separate ways?
[26:53.82]No, I like this guy.
[26:54.94]I like this Giuseppe.
[26:55.86]He's really good.
[26:56.34]Giuseppe?
[26:57.14]Yeah.
[26:57.44]Oh, yeah.
[26:57.92]Do you mind if I go William Kars like?
[27:01.41]Or do you want me to go Giuseppe too?
[27:02.69]No, no.
[27:03.21]I mean, this is a competition, so you can do what you need to do.
[27:06.49]I'm just asking questions out here.
[27:12.88]I'm prepared.
[27:14.02]Actually, really not at all, but how do you get prepared for Battleship?
[27:16.42]You just do it.
[27:18.00]Yeah, you just, you believe.
[27:19.22]You just play.
[27:20.28]Well, I actually open up twitch.tv and get, you know, just... Oh, you come over here and you take a look.
[27:25.49]Just take a peek.
[27:26.45]I mean, how do you think I won so much from you last time?
[27:29.05]Yeah, I don't, you know, I think there needs to be a verifying... Oh, by the way, speaking of verifying.
[27:35.03]House Flipper.
[27:36.76]Do we have a neutral third party?
[27:39.89]Completely neutral third party.
[27:40.91]Yes.
[27:41.73]Absolutely we do.
[27:42.71]Because if we pick a house, right?
[27:44.91]Just like one of the smaller houses.
[27:46.76]We got 20, 30 minutes, whatever, to flip it.
[27:50.96]Have a neutral third party come in.
[27:52.96]We'll do walkthroughs.
[27:54.88]A walkthrough, like real estate style.
[27:57.64]And they decide who has the better house.
[28:01.05]Yeah.
[28:01.41]I think it's a fantastic idea.
[28:02.61]Okay.
[28:04.12]I think I have a couple options.
[28:06.20]We could do... It's a little biased.
[28:08.26]I was going to say Cutie because she was an interior decorator.
[28:10.52]I think she wouldn't favor me.
[28:14.18]Or I could find someone else.
[28:16.00]Maybe Connor.
[28:17.67]Yeah, whoever would want to do it.
[28:20.27]Yeah, I like that.
[28:20.77]It's a good idea.
[28:21.27]That sounds fun.
[28:24.81]Then it takes us out of it.
[28:25.79]It takes Chad out of it.
[28:26.87]It's not like, oh, we do a poll.
[28:29.27]We have a third party come in and give us the real opinion.
[28:32.75]The facts.
[28:33.65]Nothing but the real.
[28:34.91]HGTV style.
[28:35.89]Alright, I gotta place my ships.
[28:37.54]I know I'm stalling way too much right now.
[28:40.32]Okay.
[28:40.88]I'm focused.
[28:41.74]You have somewhere to... You got a cutoff?
[28:46.72]I have a light cutoff.
[28:48.40]It's at like 637.
[28:49.62]Alright, so we should probably get rolling.
[28:53.42]I got a bit of time.
[28:53.98]I got a few hours.
[28:55.38]You have experience playing this.
[28:56.96]I've seen some of the experience you have.
[29:04.82]Oh, yeah.
[29:05.34]I get a little involved.
[29:09.86]You never want to do that.
[29:11.00]Never want to do that.
[29:13.02]Alright.
[29:14.46]I think this is good.
[29:15.84]This is terrible placement.
[29:17.73]This is not your bro versus bro.
[29:19.17]When you do bro versus bro, when you do it, then you can put your planes wherever you want, okay?
[29:25.09]Hey, man.
[29:25.65]Tell him.
[29:26.05]Tell him, Jerma.
[29:27.71]This is terrible.
[29:28.87]I don't know, dude.
[29:29.41]It can't be terrible at Battleship.
[29:31.19]There's no such thing.
[29:33.59]Alright, I'm thinking this is pretty good.
[29:36.71]I'm gonna go with this one.
[29:45.66]This sucks.
[29:46.88]It's fine!
[29:47.52]Why is everybody giving me so much shit with this?
[29:50.86]It's just basic.
[29:52.98]I'm ready.
[29:54.42]It's basic.
[29:54.84]They're all in a row.
[29:57.58]That doesn't work anyway, does it?
[30:02.21]Ah, me to start?
[30:03.57]Start like I always do?
[30:06.39]Right, yeah, mines.
[30:07.67]It's a mine meta.
[30:10.78]It's a mine meta.
[30:22.01]Is there a game you've always been chastised to play on stream?
[30:28.03]Smite.
[30:29.83]Smite because everybody hates it.
[30:31.11]They think it's funny that they hate it.
[30:33.05]And they know that I'm going to get a hundred viewers playing it.
[30:36.41]So they just play it.
[30:38.13]I guess they just want me to fail for some reason.
[30:41.03]Yeah.
[30:41.67]I have a similar thing with Toontown.
[30:44.96]Oh, Toontown.
[30:46.56]That's one that I've been looking at.
[30:49.36]Like recently?
[30:50.58]Like a year ago.
[30:51.22]Really?
[30:52.68]Only one?
[30:53.16]I got one in there.
[30:58.11]How about the loser has to play that game?
[31:01.91]The loser of this whole thing has to play Toontown.
[31:05.01]Well, no.
[31:05.55]You'd have to play Smite.
[31:06.71]Mine is Toontown.
[31:08.49]Oh.
[31:11.79]Hmm.
[31:14.61]You know... Okay.
[31:17.29]Just an hour or two?
[31:19.28]Yeah, that sounds fun.
[31:20.00]I'll make it a little yikes.
[31:22.92]People consider that to be one of my worst streams I've ever done, by the way.
[31:25.90]The Smite?
[31:26.54]Smite one, yeah.
[31:29.37]Were you just not feeling it that day?
[31:30.65]Oh, did I not intern?
[31:33.00]Oh, shit.
[31:33.40]No.
[31:34.64]No, it's just like I just was terrible and I did viewer games and there were people that played the game so much more than I do and they're so much more talented than I am.
[31:42.61]And I kind of just walked out of spawn and died like 30 or 40 times.
[31:47.85]And I made this big elaborate thing how much I played it.
[31:53.25]You hyped yourself up.
[31:54.59]People are begging me not to play.
[31:56.07]They're in the chat right now just freaking out.
[31:59.12]It's probably a good pick.
[32:02.36]Toontown is cool though.
[32:04.54]No, it was genuinely everyone begged me to play.
[32:07.50]Begged me to play.
[32:08.70]I boot up Toontown.
[32:09.68]I was averaging about 100 viewers.
[32:11.72]I dropped to 15.
[32:12.36]I did the thing where I would look at chat and I would go to read a message but there were no messages updating.
[32:22.85]100 to 15?
[32:25.29]15 people.
[32:26.67]It was hundreds begging me to play for weeks.
[32:29.87]And I looked over, there's 15 people.
[32:31.23]And the chat's not updating.
[32:32.52]I'm reading the same message.
[32:34.06]One guy said, why do you keep looking over here?
[32:36.36]There's no new messages.
[32:38.18]Somebody said that?
[32:39.06]Somebody said that to me in chat.
[32:41.00]Why are you looking over here, dude?
[32:42.60]Wow.
[32:43.90]That person, that's like an ultimate burn.
[32:46.18]I was so hurtful because he was right.
[32:49.68]He was so incredibly right.
[32:52.48]Yeah, but the rebuttal to that is, what if somebody does that?
[32:55.31]I don't want to miss it.
[32:57.89]My rebuttal to that was, oh, you're right, man.
[32:59.97]And then quietly playing Toontown for another 30 minutes before ending stream.
[33:04.53]I thought you were going to say, like, you said, fuck you, and you banned him.
[33:07.15]The only guy that was still there.
[33:08.91]I can't ban my one of 15 viewers.
[33:10.81]That's like 8%.
[33:11.59]You know, you would have, okay, you're talking about looking over and, you know, not seeing anything.
[33:19.98]Like, you would see the, like, you banned that guy message.
[33:24.84]Yeah.
[33:26.12]For a while, if you're playing Toontown, right?
[33:27.72]Yeah, like, it'd be there for probably, like, 15 minutes, and I would just look over and see, and I'd be like, you know, I'd prefer to be chastised than look at nothing.
[33:35.88]Where are your boats?
[33:38.72]Bit of a quiet round to start off.
[33:40.39]Hmm.
[33:45.17]Honest to God, where are these?
[33:46.27]Doesn't make any sense.
[33:49.33]Well, you just scanned three.
[33:56.89]Somebody said, how do you miss that much just land a shot?
[34:00.77]Because when you throw dice in the air, sometimes you look at when the dice land, it could be anything.
[34:05.55]Hey, man, they don't know about dice.
[34:09.64]Oh, devious.
[34:10.98]Bingo.
[34:13.66]Come on.
[34:14.92]Oh, there we go.
[34:15.70]Look, there we go.
[34:16.80]I thought it was the T shape.
[34:19.58]I'm very happy about that one.
[34:22.14]Okay.
[34:22.28]Alright.
[34:25.02]So you've got what are your shapes?
[34:27.13]Okay.
[34:27.35]They're on the right there, yeah.
[34:29.13]So, I mean, it's very likely.
[34:31.89]It's not likely at all, apparently.
[34:34.49]I mean, how unlikely is that?
[34:37.95]I feel like it's as likely as any of the cardinal directions, right?
[34:40.81]You put up a Mind Mandy, huh?
[34:45.19]You've changed.
[34:46.23]Bullshit, if you ask me.
[34:49.85]It's pretty early to get that Frasier in a turbo.
[34:55.09]Ooh.
[34:56.47]You started off really strong, but now it looks like I'm climbing.
[35:00.17]I'm really caught up with that.
[35:01.05]Ooh.
[35:05.45]Maybe try east or west.
[35:08.09]I mean, at this point.
[35:11.02]Whatever.
[35:13.90]It wasn't down?
[35:14.64]You have a lot of twos.
[35:16.34]Okay.
[35:16.82]Maybe if there were three and you added a mine.
[35:20.59]And you can't have a four shape.
[35:22.65]So it can't be all in the bottom three.
[35:25.43]So it probably has to be on the right.
[35:29.25]Oopsie.
[35:31.57]Somebody made an... Oh, come on.
[35:34.73]Oh, and I get the confirmation.
[35:37.46]Oh, my God.
[35:39.40]He's feeling himself.
[35:40.50]He's feeling himself.
[35:41.72]This is the worst case.
[35:45.02]But that's not the two because it would have been sunk.
[35:47.44]So that's got to be the flea.
[35:51.45]He thinks it's the fleet.
[35:53.21]He thinks it's the fleet.
[35:56.45]I really thought it was the fleet.
[35:58.71]If I'm really honest with you.
[36:00.33]Whatever, I'm fine.
[36:01.01]I'm ahead.
[36:05.10]And this is how I make my comeback.
[36:09.96]ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION!
[36:13.18]YES!
[36:13.80]Stupid fucking dumb fucking stupid fucking game.
[36:15.84]Fucking game's fucking stupid.
[36:18.22]Yeah, that's fucking stupid.
[36:21.05]Get the fuck out of here with that fucking stupid bullshit, kid.
[36:26.41]Your Boston's showing.
[36:30.37]So, oh, I wonder where he is.
[36:34.49]So that's three in a row, which means it has to be your gigantic L. Is it up or down?
[36:40.57]And by the way, if I get this right, you're taking a big L here.
[36:42.72]That's a loss for all of you at home.
[36:50.00]What's going on?
[36:52.98]What have you done?
[36:53.74]What is this?
[36:56.02]I hate when people do this.
[36:57.50]Because I'm too dumb to figure this out.
[36:59.04]I hate when people do this.
[37:04.98]It's just a ship, Jerome.
[37:06.98]No, it's three.
[37:08.06]It's like two or three ships together.
[37:09.90]It's a weirdly large ship, I know.
[37:11.94]It's weirdly large, but it's one big ship.
[37:14.84]One, two, three.
[37:18.50]God damn it.
[37:19.36]I hate this.
[37:21.09]I'll have to just...
[37:24.92]Is it this way?
[37:27.08]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[37:33.98]It's either... Okay, I'll come back to it.
[37:37.14]I'm going to come back to it.
[37:38.52]You're just going to come back to it?
[37:44.26]Oh, yes!
[37:46.24]Come on.
[37:46.82]No whammy, no whammy, no whammy, no whammy.
[37:48.16]Sorry.
[37:52.68]Come on, do it again.
[37:53.40]Now I know it's not there.
[37:54.66]I am very smart.
[38:00.69]Laugh at that?
[38:01.31]That's what you laugh at?
[38:02.05]Who says it like that?
[38:05.43]I am very smart.
[38:08.39]Oh, shit.
[38:09.46]He got it.
[38:11.20]Okay.
[38:11.64]Alright.
[38:12.06]Alright.
[38:12.36]We've tagged four of the five ships.
[38:13.58]I don't know why I thought that said ship sucks.
[38:16.22]Oh, this is actually really bad.
[38:19.06]I got to make something happen here now.
[38:21.14]Four of the five ships.
[38:22.26]This one has to go to the left.
[38:23.84]I'm in a lot of trouble now.
[38:25.80]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[38:27.38]Are you guys ready for Smite Thursday?
[38:29.78]Smite.
[38:30.18]This one's probably the long one.
[38:31.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:32.60]He's going to go left.
[38:33.26]Damn it.
[38:34.58]No.
[38:34.94]He is not.
[38:36.34]Son of a bitch.
[38:37.98]Okay.
[38:38.34]I got to get all of your ships right now.
[38:45.57]And here's the thing, though.
[38:46.51]I've been holding on to it.
[38:47.93]I've got a super soaker.
[38:50.93]You understand?
[38:51.44]Doesn't sound as threatening when you say super soaker.
[38:55.50]And I am going to just pick the place that, you know what I mean?
[38:58.80]We're going in the corner.
[39:03.30]Alright, that's fine.
[39:04.68]That's one of your... Takes one down.
[39:05.94]That's one?
[39:06.96]Takes one... I got a mine, though.
[39:08.28]You did.
[39:09.20]Come on.
[39:09.82]Come on.
[39:10.00]It's alright.
[39:10.30]Good.
[39:10.70]Good, good, good.
[39:11.45]Alright, that's tough.
[39:12.57]That's tough.
[39:13.19]That's tough.
[39:13.71]And, by the way, uh, bingo.
[39:17.55]I'm doing it again.
[39:19.67]No.
[39:20.63]Yeah, fuck it.
[39:21.41]We're going over here.
[39:24.83]Wait, you saved the two?
[39:26.55]Oh, you don't think I have a strategy?
[39:28.37]A new strategy?
[39:29.63]I think I'm going right here.
[39:32.41]Or, yeah.
[39:33.71]Yep.
[39:34.67]No.
[39:35.19]Yes.
[39:35.83]Yep.
[39:36.51]Right here.
[39:37.23]I don't know.
[39:37.89]Right here.
[39:38.53]Right there.
[39:39.57]Right here.
[39:41.99]Alright.
[39:42.29]Alright.
[39:42.87]Alright.
[39:43.57]Oh, no.
[39:44.53]Okay.
[39:45.03]Alright.
[39:47.50]Alright.
[39:48.78]Okay.
[39:53.28]Okay.
[39:54.96]This just became a video game.
[39:56.50]Okay.
[39:56.68]Okay.
[39:58.66]I have to decide now, with my slightly better than average orangutan brain, where this is, what you're doing here.
[40:07.45]I think, if I were to be smart about this, it has to be... It has to be... What the fuck is this?
[40:25.63]This has to be your Tetris piece and your L. But what way is the L going?
[40:30.79]This way.
[40:33.09]I am very good at this.
[40:35.57]I know where you are now.
[40:37.54]And now I'm going to sink the other one too.
[40:41.00]Now you're in deep shit.
[40:42.42]Well, not quite.
[40:43.78]Because you could be another way here.
[40:46.12]But I'm going to say you're over here.
[40:48.04]And you are.
[40:49.36]And this is where it gets very heated.
[40:52.38]Because I know you have a 2 right here somewhere.
[40:56.12]And ladies and gentlemen, we did it.
[41:07.83]There's no fucking way.
[41:11.43]There's no way.
[41:12.35]There's no...
[41:22.14]Oh, that's bad.
[41:23.48]That's not how you win these games, I don't think.
[41:25.47]That's the greatest mine I've ever seen both shots hit.
[41:34.25]But, uh, but you don't know what, you don't know where this is, though.
[41:39.46]It's not over.
[41:41.58]What do you mean?
[41:42.93]It's not over yet.
[41:44.39]You don't know which way the penis is going, okay?
[41:47.01]You don't.
[41:47.41]It could be going up.
[41:51.05]I lost, didn't I?
[41:53.42]What the fuck?
[41:54.88]The only way you win is if I hit a mine and it hits both of your remaining ships.
[42:00.84]Or my remaining ships.
[42:04.61]It's definitely just a T. Like, you just made a normal...
[42:08.49]Run of the mill T. It's very normal.
[42:15.05]You thought that's all I had?
[42:17.13]What?
[42:20.51]You already shot though.
[42:21.56]You already shot.
[42:23.00]You already shot.
[42:23.54]I saved my bullets.
[42:36.89]God wants me in a Mega Milk shirt.
[42:39.79]A lot of people do.
[42:43.89]He's looking down right now being like, no, no, no, I don't think so.
[42:46.45]No, no, no.
[42:47.61]And he like shoots a fucking lightning beam out and like gives you the power to do that.
[42:51.17]I gotta see him in that Mega Milk shirt.
[42:52.69]He's gotta be in that Mega Milk shirt.
[42:54.09]Otherwise, you know, what's the point of me creating?
[42:57.63]It was all for you in a Mega Milk shirt.
[43:01.05]Well, it is 1-0 in my favor now.
[43:04.66]I had that in the bag, too.
[43:06.16]Like, it's just... That's just, you know, that's how the cards lay.
[43:09.18]You know what I think your one mistake was?
[43:11.06]What was that?
[43:12.95]Destroying all my ships, even though you knew where they were.
[43:15.59]Because it gave me so many points.
[43:18.21]Yeah.
[43:19.23]Yeah, it's a whatever, though.
[43:21.51]It's fine.
[43:23.62]1-0!
[43:25.12]Jerma, where would you like to take me?
[43:29.67]Let's do the click speed.
[43:31.71]Okay.
[43:32.05]Let's go for it.
[43:34.37]Alright.
[43:34.73]Alright.
[43:34.99]God damn it.
[43:35.33]I can't believe I fucking lost that.
[43:38.01]Let's do click speed.
[43:39.15]Click speed.
[43:39.74]Click speed it is.
[43:40.38]Alright.
[43:42.56]Let's do this.
[43:43.16]So how do you want to do this?
[43:47.42]You want to do like you go and then I go?
[43:50.00]What do you want to do at the same time?
[43:52.10]Well, let's just do you go, I go.
[43:53.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:54.17]Like one at a time.
[43:55.15]Okay.
[43:56.10]And maybe we'll do like three runs each.
[43:58.52]Three runs each seems fine.
[43:59.64]Or we could do best of three, you go, I go.
[44:02.68]That works too.
[44:03.44]So you want me to go first because you want to see what you're working with here.
[44:08.00]It's your game.
[44:08.94]You picked it.
[44:09.58]You go first, then I'll go, and it's best of three.
[44:12.98]So if you win round one, et cetera.
[44:14.78]Okay.
[44:17.06]I'm going to pull up your stream, and I'll mute, and I'll let you just be in your own thoughts.
[44:21.80]Okay.
[44:37.39]Two, two, two, two, two, two, two.
[44:40.01]One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.
[44:42.01]I got it.
[44:42.83]I still got it.
[44:46.69]Mouse is on the desk.
[45:01.58]Alright, alright, alright.
[45:02.48]That's 121 clicks in 10 seconds.
[45:08.25]That's 12.1 clicks per second.
[45:10.47]121.
[45:10.49]121.
[45:11.21]That's my number to beat.
[45:16.34]Yep.
[45:22.81]I have to see what you're doing.
[45:24.89]Yeah, you can pull up the old stream there.
[45:29.95]It's a little hard to find.
[45:32.69]Let me get it.
[45:33.97]You go to youtube.com forward slash live forward slash streams forward slash now.
[45:39.29]If you blow this out of the water, I'm going to be pissed.
[45:41.29]Alright, I'm on your channel.
[45:44.23]There it is.
[45:44.51]I'm on your channel.
[45:47.38]There it is.
[45:49.58]Okay, let's see.
[45:50.22]Let's see what you got.
[45:52.78]Okay, let's see.
[45:58.35]On the table, two hands.
[46:01.02]You can use as many hands as you want, but the mouse has to be on the table.
[46:24.26]No shot.
[46:31.33]Best of three.
[46:32.59]Best of three.
[46:33.17]I just have to learn.
[46:33.87]I have to learn.
[46:35.15]I have to learn.
[46:36.67]I'm not used to keeping it on the table.
[46:41.31]He's nerfing me.
[46:43.53]Alright.
[46:43.81]It's you.
[46:44.01]It's back to you.
[46:44.97]Alright.
[46:45.17]Back to me.
[46:45.55]Back to me.
[46:45.85]Alright.
[46:48.91]Here we go.
[46:52.21]Uh, you could, you, however you want to do this, that's up to you.
[46:54.85]I just did, I did one.
[46:56.85]Just one that whole time.
[46:59.43]Let's make this hard for you.
[47:00.37]Here we go.
[47:12.82]Ah!
[47:18.60]That was a little lower than last time.
[47:20.59]I distracted you with noise.
[47:22.35]I distracted him.
[47:23.25]I thought it'd work.
[47:23.74]I thought it'd work.
[47:25.10]That was 119.
[47:25.42]Okay.
[47:26.56]Okay.
[47:28.66]119.
[47:29.26]So I have to get at least 120.
[47:31.50]You got to get at least 120 to win this one.
[47:33.26]I wish my mouse wouldn't move.
[47:38.63]If I could just do this, I would be insane.
[47:41.21]I would drop numbers that no one's ever seen before.
[47:43.13]I got to go live.
[47:45.75]There we go.
[47:47.88]How do you keep the mouse still?
[47:52.51]You want me to give you a tactic?
[47:54.49]Yeah, if you could.
[47:56.82]No.
[47:59.74]Why would I do this?
[48:00.26]It's the only game I'm going to win.
[48:02.96]No, you're not doing your feet.
[48:04.12]No, you're not doing your feet, dude.
[48:05.54]There's nothing in the rules that says a dog can't play basketball.
[48:10.27]Why do your feet look huge?
[48:13.61]What's going on?
[48:15.84]Why do you look like half your body is across the rest of the room?
[48:19.21]You look like you're sitting at the back wall and your feet are going all the way over here.
[48:24.85]What's going on with this perspective?
[48:26.01]This looks weird.
[48:28.45]You're distracting me a lot.
[48:29.72]Do you have a fisheye lens?
[48:32.06]That was really respectful.
[48:35.30]What's going on with this camera?
[48:37.32]I just need to get two feet.
[48:39.62]Alright, I'm ready.
[48:49.02]It's not even registering.
[48:54.88]You look like you're typing up like a project.
[49:01.10]I'm so frustrated.
[49:02.22]You look so tired from a full day of cramming for an exam.
[49:07.84]You're just leaning back like, fuck, man, I don't want to... How many words is a 1,200-word essay?
[49:13.16]God damn it, I'm at 1,100 words.
[49:17.66]I can't I can't do it I can't do it anymore oh my god alright alright what was your technique the technique is you you brace with whatever your non-dominant hand is and then you just spam with the other one
[49:38.60]That's not a technique.
[49:40.15]Yeah.
[49:41.37]No, I just asked you how to do a five-paragraph essay, and you said you just sit in front of the computer and you write.
[49:48.39]Yeah.
[49:50.01]What's the key?
[49:50.85]Alright.
[49:51.67]The key is... Come on over to my stream.
[49:55.14]I'll show you.
[49:55.62]I'm there.
[49:57.44]Here's the key.
[50:00.18]The key is you are not trying to click.
[50:05.25]You are trying to pulsate.
[50:08.71]Does that make sense to you?
[50:09.91]You're one finger Freddy?
[50:11.85]It's one finger Freddy and it's pulse.
[50:15.84]Like, can you pulse?
[50:22.16]For instance, let's go ahead and beat that last one.
[50:39.46]there we go alright 12.3 you should see me with a controller man you should I know that's why I picked this in particular it was a demoralizing play you're demoralizing me I gotta win at least one okay alright alright alright alright Jerm is on the board Jerm is on the board it is what it is you're putting your feet up it was like you were like lounging on a boat like that was that that I you want to go for one more don't try one more time
[51:06.38]I really don't.
[51:07.82]I really don't.
[51:09.36]I thought that you had a secret way to hold the mouse and you're using two hands.
[51:15.36]And because you kept saying as many hands as you'd like.
[51:19.13]And so I thought there was a secret hold.
[51:22.21]Oh, I would outsmart you by using my feet as the hold.
[51:26.87]I see.
[51:27.23]So you thought I was I was just kind of messing with you like that.
[51:30.05]There's a special way to do it.
[51:31.73]Yeah.
[51:32.49]Yeah, I did.
[51:33.09]I did think that I was deceived.
[51:36.65]Well, I'll take one.
[51:37.31]Let's hope I can get another one.
[51:40.55]Well, it's my game now.
[51:42.11]It's my game pick.
[51:47.94]Let's travel the world together.
[51:49.56]Let's play some GeoGuessr.
[51:51.16]Sounds good to me.
[51:51.64]A little GeoGuessr, me and you.
[51:53.42]GeoGuessr sounds good.
[51:54.38]I'm actually pretty good at this.
[51:56.54]Just to give you a quick little rundown.
[51:57.96]Really?
[51:58.82]Do you have a history?
[52:00.98]I've played it a few times on stream.
[52:02.58]Okay, sure.
[52:03.58]I think I know somewhat where I am.
[52:06.51]Now, is this world?
[52:08.17]I'm going to burp in your face.
[52:09.35]I'm really sorry.
[52:10.41]Is this world?
[52:12.05]It's actually the competitive mode.
[52:14.59]Oh.
[52:15.73]How does this work?
[52:17.09]I'll send you a link, and we duel head-to-head.
[52:19.71]We can do best of three.
[52:20.45]They're pretty fast.
[52:21.50]Okay.
[52:21.76]And...
[52:25.24]Basically, you just got to get it right, right off the bat.
[52:29.40]Yeah, you'll kind of see as it goes along.
[52:31.24]But you get as much time as it takes one person to guess.
[52:34.78]The moment one person guesses, the other person has 15 seconds to lock in a guess.
[52:39.98]You can move around, zoom, pan, whatever.
[52:43.09]But it's 15 seconds after a guess is made.
[52:45.81]And whoever is closest will get more points.
[52:48.57]And the difference in the points will take down your overall score.
[52:51.29]So you have like a life bar.
[52:53.01]Oh, okay.
[52:53.33]So am I in here?
[52:55.23]This is me.
[52:56.03]This is you.
[52:56.39]You're Sean?
[52:57.67]Yeah.
[53:00.37]Well, you didn't say the whole thing.
[53:01.65]200.
[53:02.53]Yeah.
[53:05.36]Is this like an old name?
[53:06.88]No.
[53:10.02]I just, before he became 985.
[53:13.10]Are there other 985 names on the way?
[53:16.19]Like, did you just end that Jerma?
[53:17.91]But maybe like it was Sean 200, Jeremy 201, Freddie 202.
[53:21.79]I took first names.
[53:23.15]It just kind of went from there.
[53:24.59]Right.
[53:24.99]Great.
[53:25.25]Yeah.
[53:26.99]I asked my chat earlier what the 985 was, and they said, well, this makes sense now.
[53:32.57]With a little bit of tinkering in your brain, it should make sense.
[53:36.98]Yeah, I think I get there.
[53:40.48]It's grams is what it is.
[53:41.67]That's how many grams of sugar I put in my coffee.
[53:43.91]For those that don't know.
[53:46.00]Alright, so- Are you ready?
[53:47.54]Explain how this works, but one, two, three, four, five.
[53:48.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:49.50]Just look around, look around.
[53:50.71]Well, I'm not gonna guess right away here, but you look around and you make an educated guess.
[53:55.15]Is this anywhere in the world or is this United States only?
[53:57.51]Anywhere in the world, anywhere.
[53:58.52]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[54:00.94]And then you just, when you feel comfortable and confident, you just drop a guessing.
[54:05.61]I don't want to say anything because I don't want to give you- If you prefer to mute up, you can mute up and kind of talk through your thought process.
[54:13.05]Here, I'll expedite it a bit for you, okay?
[54:15.05]Okay.
[54:17.83]You already guessed.
[54:19.91]Yeah, well, I thought I'd expedite it for you, you know?
[54:24.63]Oh, fuck.
[54:25.11]Okay.
[54:25.51]Um, well, I don't know.
[54:27.09]Seven seconds.
[54:27.75]I would click somewhere.
[54:28.49]How did you fucking- How did you do that?
[54:34.60]How did you do that?
[54:35.94]Well, the license plates had blue on each side, which is exclusive to Italy and Albania.
[54:40.92]How would you know that?
[54:42.20]Are you this well-traveled?
[54:44.40]Yeah, you know, I like to get out every once in a while.
[54:47.15]You know, I'm fluent in French.
[54:49.09]Yeah.
[54:50.03]Homage.
[54:50.95]Dude, I have not left continental North America.
[54:53.31]You understand?
[54:54.47]Ever?
[54:55.01]Ever.
[54:55.45]In my whole life.
[54:57.65]I thought you played the game a bit, though.
[54:59.07]You know, maybe...
[55:01.92]Alright.
[55:03.44]I know what this is.
[55:04.16]I know what this could be because this is very specific.
[55:07.30]Okay.
[55:07.74]Alright.
[55:08.00]10 seconds.
[55:09.06]You can speak out loud.
[55:09.96]Speak free.
[55:10.34]I'm a guest.
[55:10.74]Oklahoma.
[55:11.10]Somewhere in Oklahoma.
[55:13.05]What?
[55:13.25]What are you talking about?
[55:14.39]How would you know that?
[55:15.39]There was a guy on a lawnmower.
[55:16.75]How do you know that that's in fucking Austria?
[55:23.39]No, I need to explain your thought process on that.
[55:25.11]A guy was on a fucking rider mower.
[55:26.96]That's like John Deere.
[55:28.26]We're in Oklahoma.
[55:29.04]How did you figure that out?
[55:35.56]I figured it out because I drove by a car and it had a European license plates.
[55:41.62]And then if you look around, it's a bit gloomy, so I figured it's a bit south, right?
[55:46.35]We're not so north because it's still quite flourishing with wildlife.
[55:51.33]How many countries have you been to?
[55:53.83]I've only been to like 12.
[55:56.99]I play the game a bit.
[56:00.78]And then I just figured it was, it was middle EU.
[56:04.14]I got lucky on the hungry.
[56:05.56]I thought we were in like fucking like Oklahoma.
[56:09.30]They had a European license plate.
[56:11.34]I didn't, I, you, you guessed too quickly.
[56:13.48]I couldn't even look at the license plate.
[56:14.64]I just saw a guy in like a lawnmower and I was like, alright, this guy's got a big yard.
[56:18.11]He's got a big, a lot of grass.
[56:19.27]I don't know where his house is.
[56:21.05]I wonder, is there a dual mode with just NA?
[56:24.77]No, we, no, we, we can do Europe.
[56:27.89]That was a good one.
[56:28.75]I'll take the road back to Europe.
[56:30.43]Oh, no, I can't.
[56:31.01]I can't.
[56:32.53]I'll just change.
[56:32.99]I'll change it to United States for round two.
[56:34.70]I won one.
[56:35.28]It's now it's round two and it's just U.S.
[56:36.88]This one.
[56:37.62]Alright.
[56:38.60]Yeah, we can do whatever.
[56:39.92]I think you can click on duels and maybe that'll do.
[56:42.34]Do you need a link again?
[56:43.06]Do I just go to the menu?
[56:46.06]I can also do this for you.
[56:46.90]I think you have like a. Oh, yeah.
[56:49.85]Does that work?
[56:51.15]I think so.
[56:51.59]Yeah, it should.
[56:52.91]Shouldn't it?
[56:55.23]It does, doesn't it?
[56:56.59]OK.
[56:58.17]Alright, just U.S.
[56:58.89]This is just the United States.
[57:03.87]Bro, this is Canada.
[57:07.09]I can tell because there's a license plate.
[57:08.44]The Canadian flag is right there in the red on the license plate.
[57:11.64]You see?
[57:12.20]The lights are red.
[57:13.10]The back lights are red and white.
[57:15.08]Alright, stop fucking around before I...
[57:31.69]How?
[57:33.51]This one was just to rattle you.
[57:35.17]I have no idea.
[57:35.83]Is it just to rattle me?
[57:37.49]I have zero idea where this is.
[57:39.86]I won't even be close with my guess.
[57:43.56]Texas.
[57:44.64]I thought somewhere in New England.
[57:46.90]I thought New Hampshire?
[57:47.96]I just picked somewhere.
[57:50.37]I couldn't even zoom in fast enough.
[57:51.47]I just picked the spot up in New England.
[58:04.46]Whoa, hurry up!
[58:05.40]I don't know what- I don't know.
[58:07.76]There's gonna be a sign here.
[58:51.06]What the fuck did that say?
[59:19.07]Uh, who's closer?
[59:20.37]Me.
[59:20.77]Slightly.
[59:22.71]Did you find one of the highways?
[59:23.65]Nah, I just figured it was like somewhere in the middle.
[59:28.78]I was trying to go to the airport.
[59:32.14]You were trying to go to the airport?
[59:33.72]Yeah, because it'd be like, oh, welcome to beautiful, like, Chicago or something, right?
[59:37.65]Like at the airport.
[59:38.33]Right, right, right.
[59:50.63]Oh, you must have found something.
[59:59.51]I don't know.
[60:00.45]Fucking Utah?
[60:02.11]I got stuck in the parking lot.
[60:06.07]Yeah, me too.
[60:06.63]I just clicked.
[60:07.57]I clicked because I figured you would think I know what I'm doing, but I didn't.
[60:12.04]That's actually a pretty good strategy, I think.
[60:16.32]Try to get close enough and have the other person panic.
[60:18.40]Yeah.
[60:19.95]I just guessed central enough.
[60:31.72]Very obviously, I know where we are.
[60:35.52]But where are we?
[60:37.72]No way.
[60:53.99]no way I thought it was like somewhere in like this like Ohio Pittsburgh I got lucky a guy had a Philadelphia eagles sticker on his uh car oh this is a healing round so you can't lose here it's all about just getting close and you can recover up to a quarter of the points for your guess
[61:25.04]Yeah, that's a good strategy.
[61:26.24]Look for, like, stickers on cars.
[61:28.56]Uh-huh.
[61:30.06]Yeah, people are very, um, proud.
[61:36.59]You ever thought about a Jerma985 bumper sticker?
[61:38.89]No.
[61:39.07]It's time to start thinking about it.
[61:44.93]So I can drive around and find, see if somebody has it, and, like, beep, beep, like, beep at them and be like, hey, man!
[61:50.94]You know how Jeep owners, they do a nod?
[61:54.96]It's like a thing if you have a Jeep, you nod at other Jeep owners.
[61:57.54]Maybe Jerma sticker havers do like a sign to each other that only they know.
[62:02.60]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[62:07.63]Have a little secret handshake.
[62:10.19]Exactly.
[62:10.79]Where the hell does this want me to go?
[62:12.61]I don't want to go that way.
[62:16.27]What's that?
[62:27.06]What's that?
[62:34.56]Did I get it?
[62:39.19]Oh.
[62:39.63]Oh, you were closer.
[62:41.15]It was Arkansas.
[62:41.77]I was thinking like Kansas, Oklahoma.
[62:44.17]Yeah, yeah.
[62:45.53]Just throwing AR on it.
[62:46.37]You're there.
[62:47.29]Here we go.
[62:48.62]This is where it gets real.
[62:50.54]Your 1.5x damage.
[62:51.28]Yeah, you could beat me in one fell swoop if you get a good enough guess.
[63:01.20]It's just literally, this is every neighborhood in America.
[63:03.40]I know, seriously.
[63:06.50]I'm lost in cul-de-sacs.
[63:19.94]This could be anywhere.
[63:23.14]Gotta find a main road.
[63:26.52]Or, do not.
[63:31.95]Oh, I thought that was going to be like a, I'm running for Senator here.
[63:50.49]I'm just like making noises on your screen.
[63:54.95]I'm so deep in thought that your noise is, it's like a good buffer.
[64:10.57]Main road does not help.
[64:11.97]I feel like that's a guess.
[64:17.53]That was a bad guess.
[64:19.79]That was a bad guess for me.
[64:29.25]Oh, it's a great guess from him.
[64:31.54]That's a go.
[64:35.18]Indiana.
[64:36.60]I think I've seen Indiana.
[64:45.25]Well I didn't say Indiana.
[64:47.81]This is the big one, this is gonna be whoever, this is gonna be it.
[64:50.57]This could be, unless we're both very close, yeah.
[64:54.80]This could seal it.
[64:55.62]Alright, we're going straight up.
[65:25.47]No info.
[65:27.17]What's this?
[65:28.37]I thought that was a Krispy Kreme.
[65:31.67]Oh, what the fuck?
[65:54.03]Big?
[65:54.69]This place is called Big D?
[65:56.53]Any guesses on your end?
[66:00.39]I'm a little lost.
[66:29.89]He's not going to be close.
[66:30.51]Sorry.
[66:30.69]I'm going to win.
[66:35.99]Oh, I lost.
[66:36.41]I thought you said you had lost.
[66:39.40]Yeah, I lied.
[66:40.04]That's why I was like, oh, I'll just be close.
[66:44.64]I'll be close enough.
[66:45.94]Oh, no, no.
[66:46.90]I found a sign.
[66:47.74]I found a sign.
[66:50.02]Shit.
[66:51.93]2-1 then.
[66:52.43]2-1 then, Jerma.
[66:53.61]Yeah, it's 2-1.
[66:56.95]2-1.
[66:57.55]And your pick as well.
[66:58.57]Mm-hmm.
[66:59.99]Okay, don't be down on yourself.
[67:01.59]I won my game.
[67:02.27]It's normal.
[67:03.93]I don't know how well you're going to do on this next one.
[67:08.42]Because we're playing pick Ross.
[67:12.56]Did you have any opportunity to sit down and play pick Ross to even know how the game works?
[67:19.16]This is picked up picks, right?
[67:20.18]It's picked up picks.
[67:22.70]Not one second.
[67:23.70]You have not played even one second of this.
[67:26.08]Okay.
[67:26.58]So, I mean, this is a guaranteed win.
[67:30.09]You didn't play one second?
[67:32.53]I thought I would just naturally beat you out with my gaming skills.
[67:35.69]Oh, dude.
[67:37.27]Oh, I don't know, man.
[67:40.21]This is like a thing you need to know how to play.
[67:43.70]But if you win... This could be a lie, too.
[67:46.28]You could be making this up.
[67:48.08]If you beat me without any experience, you have no idea what's going on, then I'm hanging up the gloves.
[67:53.22]Is this single player?
[67:54.04]Oh, yeah.
[67:55.18]Here's what's going to happen.
[67:57.60]We are going to... I'm going to pick you a puzzle.
[68:00.18]We're both going to do the puzzle at the same time, starting at the same time.
[68:03.68]And whoever completes the puzzle first wins that round.
[68:08.54]We'll do best two out of three.
[68:10.16]Oh, love that.
[68:12.87]So let's go ahead.
[68:13.53]We can be very democratic about this.
[68:15.67]Okay, okay.
[68:19.19]Great song, by the way.
[68:20.83]Oh, yeah.
[68:21.15]No, PictoPix is great.
[68:22.43]Picross is great, too.
[68:24.07]I hope you enjoy what you're doing because it's very, very much one of the greatest mind puzzles ever.
[68:32.88]Is there a difference?
[68:36.36]I probably should give you at least a small rundown of what's going on.
[68:42.33]I kind of have to.
[68:44.41]In general, it doesn't have to be in depth.
[68:46.81]Don't feel bad for me.
[68:49.55]I brought you to GeoGuessr and you clicked on Oklahoma when it was hungry.
[68:52.95]That's true.
[68:54.87]Okay, let's go ahead and let's do a tutorial.
[68:57.75]I feel like that's fair.
[69:00.26]Okay, sure.
[69:01.18]It's not fair if you're not getting a tutorial.
[69:03.50]It's just a fact.
[69:06.44]Let me open it up.
[69:08.22]Do you have access to the ones that are 15 by 15, by the way?
[69:25.74]Or are they all locked?
[69:26.70]In classic mode?
[69:27.94]Just in classic mode.
[69:28.67]Are they locked?
[69:33.07]Yeah, I think I can do it.
[69:34.41]Okay.
[69:34.71]Oh, no, they're locked.
[69:35.51]Oh, they are locked.
[69:36.67]Okay.
[69:36.77]They're absolutely locked, yeah.
[69:38.53]This is going to be tricky.
[69:39.82]I can only do five by fives.
[69:41.46]Oh, you can only do the five by fives.
[69:45.54]What's wrong with that?
[69:46.06]Is that bad?
[69:46.88]That means we can't do the same puzzle.
[69:49.30]Wait, you can't do the five by fives?
[69:50.46]Or are you already done?
[69:51.09]I've already done those five by fives.
[69:54.38]There's an endless mode.
[69:55.74]What if we just do that?
[69:56.68]What is endless mode?
[69:58.18]Let me try to get this captured.
[69:59.78]I can't get it captured.
[70:00.56]Why not?
[70:05.08]Game capture.
[70:05.78]What's going on here, dude?
[70:10.48]Oh, this is just Voltorb Flip.
[70:11.64]This is what?
[70:15.39]This is Voltorb Flip.
[70:17.07]I've played this game before.
[70:18.09]Voltorb Flip?
[70:19.55]Uh-huh.
[70:19.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:22.19]Yeah, in Pokémon, they have a game called Voltorb Flip, and it's very similar to this.
[70:29.81]Is Voltorb Flip Picross?
[70:33.33]It is.
[70:34.31]That is exactly what this is.
[70:36.47]It is Voltorb Flip.
[70:38.37]Yeah, slightly less.
[70:39.37]There's a little more guessing in that game, but yeah.
[70:42.39]Alright.
[70:43.60]So here's what we're going to do.
[70:46.22]We'll do minimum width, max width, do 15.
[70:51.98]Wait, wait, minimum width, max width?
[70:54.12]Yeah, make it 15 by 15.
[70:56.98]Or 15, we can do 10 by 10.
[71:00.23]How do you know when you're done, by the way, out of curiosity?
[71:02.21]It'll complete.
[71:04.47]You're making a picture.
[71:06.55]Great.
[71:07.31]So do 10 by 10, and just do play.
[71:09.99]Okay.
[71:10.94]Let's go over some very basic, I'm so happy, by the way, that you're playing this.
[71:16.02]okay because dude this is the new meta I'm telling you this is the new another this is another forget battleship which where do you want me to go for this I do endless and do 10 by 10. endless max width 10 max height 10. uh now it's probably gonna give us it's probably gonna give us different puzzles I'm gonna yeah
[71:38.05]Because yours probably does not look like mine.
[71:41.25]No, I see your screen.
[71:41.87]They're different.
[71:42.55]They are different.
[71:43.05]Okay.
[71:43.59]So, hmm.
[71:45.91]We may have to pivot.
[71:47.24]We may have to pivot to neutral.
[71:48.24]No, no, no.
[71:48.72]Click through a couple times here.
[71:49.86]Let me see what you're getting into.
[71:51.02]Okay.
[71:51.40]So let's do tutorial.
[71:53.16]This is awesome.
[71:54.92]Okay.
[71:55.88]So how Picross works.
[71:57.19]Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[71:58.05]Welcome.
[71:59.05]How Picross works, my friend, is this.
[72:02.19]You have a grid and you have a series of numbers.
[72:04.74]This is not Sudoku.
[72:07.16]So shut up.
[72:08.34]This is different.
[72:09.96]Where you start is you see these numbers I have on the left and numbers I have on top.
[72:14.12]For instance, this one here is six.
[72:15.97]What this means is this means that six of these squares are going to be filled in on this row, okay?
[72:26.55]They will also be filled in
[72:29.37]horizontally.
[72:30.83]So this six is part of this one two one two.
[72:34.55]Do you understand?
[72:35.53]What is one two?
[72:36.39]Why do they express it one two one two?
[72:38.89]I'm so glad you asked that question.
[72:40.42]A six.
[72:41.54]So on the left side, in between each one of these numbers, there has to be at least one space.
[72:50.82]So let's say, for instance, if the one was right here,
[72:53.75]The two would have to be at least here.
[72:56.57]Oh, the twos are connected.
[72:58.71]Yeah, they cannot be... If there's a space in between, they cannot be touching.
[73:04.25]So, for instance, we got four, one, one down here.
[73:07.87]That means there's going to be four in a row somewhere, a space, a one, and a space.
[73:12.73]That space does not mean one space.
[73:15.03]That means any amount of spaces.
[73:18.03]So that means that could be one, two, three, four.
[73:20.85]All these spaces, one, space, one.
[73:26.28]And you have to use logic to deduce exactly where these pieces need to go.
[73:32.81]So, let's do a little bit of logic here.
[73:35.23]So, if you've got 10 spaces here, it has to be some of the middle that are filled in.
[73:40.05]It has to be.
[73:43.77]It has to be.
[73:45.45]So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[73:47.27]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[73:48.57]You know for certain these two have to be filled in.
[73:50.59]They have to be.
[73:51.33]100% of the time.
[73:52.48]Follow me?
[73:57.38]I'm following.
[73:59.06]So this is where it gets hard, because you have to figure out where, because you're looking up the top row, you're looking at the bottom row, and there's no way for you to tell initially.
[74:08.09]You have to kind of work backwards in a way.
[74:10.49]So let's start here.
[74:12.03]By the way, there's only 10 spaces, so if you have an opportunity where it's like 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, you know that 8 of these spaces are filled in.
[74:21.30]There's only 10.
[74:21.64]So...
[74:23.59]I mean, it's fun.
[74:25.09]It's really.
[74:25.47]The top 10 game on... Oh, we already did it.
[74:28.19]What?
[74:29.79]No, I... No, no, no.
[74:31.13]I'm just... I'm working on it a little bit here.
[74:32.65]Okay.
[74:35.17]So that's the concept of the game.
[74:36.91]Okay.
[74:37.77]So let's see if I can do this.
[74:39.99]This one's kind of tricky.
[74:42.36]Because that's 4-1-1.
[74:43.62]It has to be the high.
[74:47.30]Actually, I don't know.
[74:51.90]One, four, one.
[74:52.62]Any of these equal 10?
[74:54.28]I don't think so.
[74:55.34]Wait, three, four, five, six, seven.
[74:56.64]Okay.
[74:56.78]Alright.
[74:57.82]Perfect example.
[74:59.06]Perfect example.
[75:00.14]You see this one right here?
[75:00.92]Uh-huh.
[75:02.40]You see how that's a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[75:07.76]And there are three spaces.
[75:09.70]Eight, nine, 10.
[75:11.20]Take a look at that.
[75:12.53]Ladies and gentlemen, now you've got yourself a full row.
[75:15.69]And block these out so you don't fuck it up for yourself later.
[75:19.23]Interesting.
[75:19.75]That's a right click, by the way.
[75:21.05]Interesting.
[75:21.98]Now, if there's other one, two, three ones, you know that that's certain that they're going to be filled in.
[75:28.39]And that gives you information here as well.
[75:30.01]See these ones up here?
[75:32.37]Excuse me.
[75:33.82]If these are all ones, you know for a fact there has to be a space between them.
[75:39.02]There has to be.
[75:39.94]So that's blocked off and that's blocked off.
[75:42.14]Mm-hmm.
[75:46.31]Someone said stop.
[75:47.03]This is awful.
[75:48.25]What?
[75:49.05]I think this is great.
[75:49.95]This is great.
[75:50.51]This is a good... I think it's delightful.
[75:53.89]He's pretending.
[75:55.15]I don't think you're pretending.
[75:56.80]I'm pretending.
[75:57.44]What would I be pretending?
[75:58.28]Yeah, I know.
[75:58.88]What?
[75:59.82]Alright, so here.
[76:01.42]2-1-2.
[76:01.50]2-1-2.
[76:03.08]It's... Let me... Student Ludwig.
[76:05.76]Uh-huh.
[76:06.76]Yeah, please.
[76:07.16]Would you... What would you... What would you consider doing here?
[76:11.88]On the, which one?
[76:12.82]The 212?
[76:13.66]Yeah, what would you, I mean, do you have any information that you think you could give me?
[76:16.42]Right, right.
[76:17.49]212.
[76:17.59]Let's take a peek at this bad boy on the 212 over here.
[76:22.15]Yeah, yeah.
[76:24.42]Oh, a lot of information, actually, now that I'm, I'm like, I'm zooming out a bit.
[76:27.74]I'm zooming out a bit.
[76:28.80]Yeah.
[76:29.79]To be clear, you're talking about the 2-1-2, the left.
[76:31.73]I'm talking about the left 2-1-2 here.
[76:33.33]Right.
[76:33.69]The left 2-1-2.
[76:35.61]The information in so interesting.
[76:37.97]It's funny you bring it up.
[76:39.17]The middle probably can't have anything around it, right?
[76:41.79]That is exactly precisely what's going on.
[76:44.30]So probably got to block those guys out.
[76:46.72]Yes.
[76:47.04]Shut off the blinds there is minimum.
[76:49.54]Now, you know, you know that this is the two.
[76:53.24]Oh, yeah.
[76:53.70]Has to go this way or it has to go this way.
[76:55.22]You don't have that info, so don't be careful.
[76:56.80]Don't do it.
[76:57.30]Don't know yet.
[76:57.94]Don't know yet.
[76:58.32]We'll get there.
[76:59.02]You might get there.
[76:59.56]Baby steps, you know?
[77:01.18]There's another thing.
[77:01.86]You know that the other two is here somewhere.
[77:03.97]You don't know if it's here.
[77:04.79]It's like Battleship, right?
[77:06.33]You're trying to figure out where that ship is.
[77:08.87]Where's that two?
[77:10.01]Where is it?
[77:10.35]Could it be sticking this way?
[77:11.23]Could it be over here?
[77:12.93]It's too early to tell.
[77:15.23]I'd say it's similar to Battleship, yeah.
[77:17.35]But again, take a look down here.
[77:20.86]What would you do with this?
[77:23.99]uh down four one one you probably gotta do all the four on the left right bottom left well hold on slow down I guess I guess that's not necessarily the case what do you absolutely know with this right here uh this can't be the four because obviously if that was the four remember it's it's sequential this has to be the first number in in this row right if this is part of the four
[77:49.13]It would have to be like 1, 2, 3.
[77:51.09]Let's see.
[77:52.05]Yeah.
[77:52.47]If this was the 4, it would have to be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[77:56.83]And then space 1, space 1.
[77:58.41]But you don't know that information yet.
[77:59.90]So this is impossible.
[78:02.00]It could be part of the 4.
[78:03.78]You never just YOLO guess and rip it?
[78:05.82]You could, but you got to get it right.
[78:07.14]Right.
[78:08.28]If you YOLO guess and rip it, the picture will not complete.
[78:12.29]Makes sense.
[78:12.81]Makes sense.
[78:14.19]So it's always a picture.
[78:14.99]Is that the case?
[78:15.91]It's always a picture.
[78:17.15]Interesting.
[78:17.73]Interesting.
[78:19.71]Okay.
[78:20.42]Alright.
[78:20.86]I think I'm getting the hang of it.
[78:21.88]You know, I think I'm slightly... Yeah, I think I'm slightly getting the hang of it.
[78:25.92]I'm getting like inch by inch, you know?
[78:27.74]Yeah.
[78:28.42]Rome was built today.
[78:29.30]It's a really fun game.
[78:30.52]I would highly recommend it.
[78:31.52]Alright, so let me see if I can figure this one out while we... Alright, you do that one and let me mull this guy over, right?
[78:38.27]Let me just... Yeah, mull it over.
[78:39.69]You're good.
[78:40.75]Give it a stab.
[78:41.43]Yeah, just mull it over.
[78:44.53]So I'll start this mulling.
[78:47.42]This one, this is part of the two, but I don't know where.
[78:51.16]This is part of the two, but I'm not entirely sure.
[78:53.04]Two, three, four, five, six, nine.
[78:55.64]I don't have that info yet.
[78:59.23]This one's tricky.
[78:59.83]This one actually is pretty tricky, because there's really a lot of low numbers here.
[79:06.49]It really could be anywhere.
[79:10.31]Or... I mean, okay, it has to be.
[79:12.52]Take a look at this, right?
[79:16.52]We know that.
[79:18.43]I mean, he's already done.
[79:19.23]I'm not done.
[79:21.43]Come on.
[79:21.73]They're just, they're toying around, right?
[79:23.07]What are you talking about?
[79:23.83]Have you been, wait, this is, is it, are we doing this one for real?
[79:27.01]What's up?
[79:27.47]No, we're just having fun right now.
[79:28.81]You're getting stressed out.
[79:30.33]Alright.
[79:30.65]This is, this one's for, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[79:32.76]He's, he, I see what you're doing.
[79:35.64]I'm going to be quiet because I can't talk and play this game.
[79:39.56]It takes way too much of my brain power.
[79:42.04]I don't blame you.
[79:50.90]one's fucking hard this one's actually really hard I got a really hard one
[80:12.41]What makes it hard?
[80:13.15]A lot of low numbers.
[80:14.13]Just not having like free ones, like free spaces.
[80:17.39]Where this game gets really hard is when you have a lot of low numbers that do not equal close to the maximum on the grid.
[80:23.97]So if you have a bunch of ones and twos, you have to really work backwards.
[80:32.94]Shit.
[80:39.56]I've got to make a decision here.
[80:41.55]I've got to make a decision.
[80:43.63]I got a terrible one.
[80:47.02]It's okay.
[80:47.54]So the ones that are endless, I think are random.
[80:50.08]So I don't know if I can like logically deduce this one.
[80:57.22]Okay.
[80:57.50]So I did my puzzle.
[80:58.64]I think I got it.
[81:00.40]Did it finish?
[81:01.58]Yeah, yeah, it, like, popped up and it said, well done.
[81:03.82]Oh, you finished it.
[81:04.64]Alright, okay.
[81:05.58]Alright, so you get it.
[81:06.86]I think I get it.
[81:07.60]Alright, you get it.
[81:09.20]Let's do one for real.
[81:10.36]Alright, you want to do a big one?
[81:12.14]Yeah, 15 by 15, is that the normal?
[81:14.28]Let's do 15 by 15.
[81:15.46]Okay, and endless mode, I suppose?
[81:17.51]I guess we'll do endless mode.
[81:18.63]Okay, alright.
[81:19.53]And we're going to, I guess we'll mute because I'm going to be, I need to focus intensely.
[81:22.55]Yeah, no, I think that's fair.
[81:23.57]I think that's fair.
[81:24.43]You click on the size multiples of five in square grid check boxes, right?
[81:28.75]Um... Hold on...
[81:34.84]Endless isn't like concrete pictures if that's right.
[81:37.18]Size multiple of five.
[81:38.20]Yeah, what's that?
[81:38.62]I don't know what that means.
[81:41.04]It was pre-checked, so I guess I'll keep it.
[81:42.48]Maybe yours was pre-checked?
[81:44.65]Yeah.
[81:45.67]Oh, yeah.
[81:45.91]I think that, okay.
[81:46.47]Checked means is the, okay.
[81:47.83]Yeah, I see.
[81:48.47]Yeah.
[81:48.75]Alright.
[81:49.15]You ready to do it?
[81:50.13]Yeah, let's boot up.
[81:51.01]Alright.
[81:51.31]I'm muting.
[81:52.05]Good luck.
[81:52.51]Yeah, yeah.
[81:55.33]Let's go.
[81:58.05]15 by 15.
[81:58.21]Let's do it.
[82:00.01]Fuck yeah.
[82:00.75]Fuck yeah!
[82:01.41]Picross, baby.
[82:02.85]Alright, 15.
[82:04.46]Shit, this is gonna take a long time.
[82:05.68]I don't think he's prepared.
[82:07.02]This is gonna take like an hour.
[82:10.60]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[82:11.10]Shit, it's close though.
[82:13.23]It's gotta be a guarantee.
[82:16.81]Shit, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[82:17.25]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[82:17.45]Fuck you!
[82:25.03]Did I count wrong?
[82:28.05]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[82:29.67]I don't know.
[82:32.63]I can't make that deduction.
[82:37.94]I can get the 9.
[82:38.40]9.
[82:38.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[82:38.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[82:56.35]We got that.
[82:56.81]Good start.
[82:58.33]Good start.
[82:58.83]Fuck.
[82:59.61]Five.
[83:01.16]Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
[83:03.82]I'm gonna lose.
[83:17.61]In my own fucking game.
[83:22.99]14, it's not enough.
[83:23.55]It could either be here and down or here and down, right?
[83:26.39]But fuck, there's no way for me to tell.
[83:30.17]Fuck, I'm going to lose in my own game.
[83:31.44]I'm going to lose in my own game that I picked, and I was so confident.
[83:44.92]Six.
[83:45.26]Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[83:47.94]Mm-mm.
[83:56.74]That's 14.
[83:57.04]I'm gonna lose in my own game.
[84:03.82]I can't even go anywhere.
[84:15.54]I don't know where to start from this.
[84:23.53]This is probably the one, but I don't know.
[84:25.79]It could be anything.
[84:26.51]It's nine.
[84:35.92]This, I'm going to have to just go for it.
[84:38.82]But there's no way for me to know.
[84:41.38]One, two, three, four.
[84:43.08]One, two, three, four.
[84:44.38]There has to be one here.
[84:47.28]And then somewhere in the middle, the three...
[84:50.95]Why did I pick Picross?
[84:53.45]The endless mode is random numbers!
[84:55.04]I didn't know it was gonna be random!
[85:04.40]I'm fucked.
[85:14.73]Alright, start over here.
[85:19.58]10, 11, 12.
[85:22.52]4, 1.
[85:22.70]No, I can't do it.
[85:27.47]4, 5, 6, 7.
[85:28.49]There's nowhere to start.
[85:30.19]There's nowhere to start.
[85:34.09]Bro, there's nowhere to start.
[85:35.31]There's nowhere for me to go from here.
[85:36.99]I don't think I can fucking do this one.
[85:39.15]There's nowhere for me to go.
[85:40.03]I have to guess.
[85:40.57]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[85:45.82]This is part of the... I don't fucking know.
[85:56.25]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[85:58.21]The thing is, if I get this wrong, the whole thing is fucked up.
[86:05.27]Okay, relax.
[86:08.43]It has to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 1.
[86:13.81]It has to be this.
[86:16.31]It has to be.
[86:22.93]And then the 3, I don't know where the 3 is though.
[86:27.87]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[86:28.53]1, 2, 3.
[86:28.79]I don't know.
[86:29.95]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[86:31.81]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[86:33.63]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[86:34.25]OK, this has to be this.
[86:36.27]2, 3, 4, 5.
[86:36.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[86:37.25]Right?
[86:37.61]Yeah.
[87:29.09]It's gonna be so embarrassing when he comes over to the stream.
[87:31.89]When he comes over and he finishes and he sees this, it's gonna be the most embarrassing moment of my career.
[87:38.70]It's gonna be the most embarrassing moment of my entire career.
[87:43.26]He's gonna be like, alright man, that was pretty easy.
[87:44.82]And he's gonna come over and I'm gonna be like, I don't know, I have four spaces filled in.
[88:08.52]It's so fucking much harder than the regular ones.
[88:12.00]Okay.
[88:14.55]4, 2, I don't fucking know, man.
[88:16.41]I have to guess in random directions, I think.
[88:18.25]I have to guess.
[88:19.37]I have to guess.
[88:21.66]Fuck.
[88:22.80]Okay, it's time to guess.
[88:24.46]Because there's no way for me to logically fucking deduce this random mode.
[88:40.12]If it's wrong, the whole thing's fucked anyways.
[88:48.75]It's wrong.
[88:50.51]This is definitely not... This is one of the ones.
[88:52.23]I got it.
[88:54.99]It's wrong.
[88:55.77]That has to go... Yeah.
[88:59.96]Yep.
[89:01.36]I deduced this one with my fucking brain.
[89:03.10]Check this out.
[89:08.11]See this?
[89:09.37]That's definitely one of the ones.
[89:10.52]The two is over here somewhere.
[89:11.84]I've deduced it.
[89:15.02]Shit, no I didn't.
[89:35.48]I don't think I can actually logically figure this out.
[89:38.39]But if you guess and it's wrong, the whole thing is over.
[89:41.61]I'm trying to hit you with a battle axe.
[89:54.03]He's like fucking swinging at me and I'm dodging.
[89:58.77]I have to go for it, because how the fuck?
[90:01.37]And maybe I know that, at least.
[90:02.77]Because there's no way this is part of the two.
[90:04.10]Am I getting a bloody nose from this?
[90:06.74]No.
[90:08.84]So this is probably part of the four.
[90:10.34]It is.
[90:11.54]This is probably part of the four.
[90:13.48]One, two, three, four.
[90:14.68]So we're going to say it can't be that way.
[90:18.70]This also is... Maybe not, though.
[90:22.07]I don't know that.
[90:24.66]Because this could be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[90:27.58]1, 2.
[90:27.66]Yeah.
[90:28.04]I don't fucking know that.
[90:29.04]Bro.
[90:34.27]This is so hard.
[90:48.94]If I'm going to at least say that this is not the 2, then I'm going to commit to it.
[90:55.00]If I commit to that, then that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[90:57.60]1, 2, 3, 4.
[90:59.53]These can be filled in.
[91:04.63]Now, is that the 1 or part of the 3?
[91:09.05]Is this the 2?
[91:11.09]There's no way to tell.
[91:12.52]There's no way to tell.
[91:24.60]Ludwig said, please, let's do an easier one.
[91:28.12]Hey, what's up?
[91:30.80]Hello, hello.
[91:31.52]How you doing?
[91:32.40]I'm doing okay.
[91:33.95]Did you finish?
[91:34.31]A little bit of guessing.
[91:35.63]No, did you?
[91:36.17]You didn't?
[91:37.11]Oh, my God, dude.
[91:37.87]Look at my stream.
[91:39.09]You didn't finish?
[91:39.67]Wait, what are you?
[91:42.51]You're barely through it.
[91:43.35]This is way too hard.
[91:47.49]15 by 15 is a bit, it's a bit, it's a lot.
[91:50.39]It's a mental task.
[91:53.17]I think part of the problem is because it's endless random mode.
[91:57.21]It might be even harder because when you completed the last one, did you make a picture?
[92:02.38]It was like vines.
[92:04.84]Okay.
[92:05.06]It was like over Earth.
[92:06.38]Like I would not have seen it as a picture normally.
[92:09.82]How are you doing?
[92:12.46]I'm doing okay, you know, I'm hanging in there.
[92:15.14]Would you like to go to a 10x10?
[92:18.26]I am down to go to a 10x10, yeah, because I think this would take me a good 45 minutes.
[92:22.10]Yeah, and I know you've got to go at like 6 or something, so... No, no, I've got to at least 6, 7, yeah, yeah, roughly.
[92:27.73]I suppose it's too hard, so... Alright, alright, alright.
[92:31.87]Let's do a 10x10.
[92:34.25]You have no idea.
[92:35.97]I thought you were running through it.
[92:37.59]I thought you were just smoking me.
[92:38.67]I'm sitting here panicking.
[92:39.87]I was like, this is over.
[92:40.99]Like I picked the game and I can't even do it.
[92:43.20]I think it's, I'm going fast, but I was so worried that it's like at the end, it's not going to complete.
[92:50.64]And I'm going to look back and be like, oh, cause it's a couple of points.
[92:52.98]I'm just like, I'll put the six there.
[92:55.96]Because it just feels nice.
[92:57.80]It feels good to just click it.
[92:59.52]But if you're wrong, the whole thing's messed up.
[93:01.60]Exactly.
[93:02.12]Yeah, yeah.
[93:02.62]So I was making a lot of risky plays.
[93:04.52]10 by 10 will be a lot easier.
[93:07.76]10 by 10, I feel great.
[93:09.44]We're going to cap this out in 10 minutes each, I imagine.
[93:11.92]I think so.
[93:12.20]Alright, you ready?
[93:13.34]Alright.
[93:13.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[93:14.40]Good luck, good luck.
[93:14.92]See you soon.
[93:15.30]Good luck.
[93:17.12]Let's go.
[93:20.38]Much better.
[93:20.80]Much better.
[93:21.28]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[93:21.64]Anything filled?
[93:28.03]Eight.

[93:36.39]One, two, three, four, five.
[93:37.67]Fuck, I don't know that.
[93:38.31]I can't do that.
[93:38.77]Yes, I can.
[93:41.06]Fuck you.
[93:41.34]What are you talking about?
[93:42.10]The two.

[94:02.34]Okay, that's part of the one.
[94:13.27]That's part of this one.
[94:17.23]Also part of the one.
[94:18.33]This is part of the three.
[94:19.09]This is part of the two.
[94:19.85]One, two, or one, two.
[94:20.77]The rest of this cannot be filled in.

[97:29.34]This has to be there.
[97:30.02]There you go.
[97:30.32]Get rid of this.
[97:32.57]This is the 2, but what direction?
[97:34.24]That way.
[97:36.26]This is the 3, but what direction?
[97:37.40]I don't know.
[97:39.42]Is it 3?
[97:46.27]2, 2, this is the 1.
[97:49.21]No, it might not be.
[97:50.29]Yes, it is.
[97:51.49]Is it 2?
[97:53.17]1, 1.
[97:53.73]Fuck!
[97:54.19]No, wrong.
[97:57.44]Um, is this the 2?

[98:31.37]Bingo.
[98:35.17]I got it.
[98:38.99]That's a that's a completed picture.
[98:40.79]I know where you were quick.
[98:43.15]I have no idea what this is.
[98:45.35]I want you to know you bested me.
[98:48.09]Because I was still I was still really thinking I was still mulling it over.
[98:54.02]This is this is it's a hard game.
[98:56.24]It's very hard.
[98:59.58]Which means this
[99:04.65]I'm sorry.
[99:05.73]I don't want to stall and finish my painting.
[99:07.17]I'm just close.
[99:07.99]No, no, do it.
[99:09.73]I mean, I just did it.
[99:10.73]So, yeah, I mean, they're tricky, man.
[99:13.45]They really are.
[99:19.30]Okay.
[99:19.86]One, one, two.
[99:22.00]They're really fun, though.
[99:27.25]Got it.
[99:28.79]Dude, you were literally 30 seconds behind me.
[99:35.60]so yeah it took me six minutes ten seconds a little over a little over alright that's your win though that's your win yeah so you know hey credit where credit's due but that's a good game oh do you want to do best no we don't win can I ask you a serious question be please I you know you and I know each other pretty well now uh-huh how do you hate this
[99:56.60]This game?
[99:57.06]Yeah.
[99:58.14]No, I actually think this game's fun.
[99:59.58]Okay, alright, cool.
[100:00.88]I played a game on the... I think it's Pokémon Platinum.
[100:07.53]Maybe earlier.
[100:08.17]But there's a game called Voltorb Flip that is very similar to this.
[100:11.61]Yep.
[100:11.99]But there is a level of RNG in it.
[100:15.15]So it's only 5x5.
[100:19.94]But there are, like, bad squares, and if you click the bad squares, you lose.
[100:23.74]Yeah, there are versions that will do that, too.
[100:27.27]Right.
[100:27.99]They add, like, a minute to your time or something if you get it wrong.
[100:31.43]I've probably played that game for maybe eight hours straight.
[100:37.72]Yeah.
[100:38.72]Just, like, getting upset.
[100:40.02]I've melted eight to ten hours just lying in bed playing the one on the DS.
[100:47.18]And it's like 12 o'clock at night or like 1 o'clock in the morning.
[100:51.40]And the sun starts coming up and you're just like, oh, shit.
[100:54.54]You just put it down and roll over and go to bed.
[100:56.52]Yeah.
[100:57.62]I can't imagine.
[100:58.30]I'm looking at classic mode, right?
[100:59.70]And it has the, what is it?
[101:02.78]The 40 by 40s.
[101:05.37]I can't imagine that.
[101:06.59]No.
[101:06.85]That's like a 2,000 piece jigsaw.
[101:10.79]It would take me like a...
[101:12.95]few weeks to chew through I feel like some of these would be almost impossible to do with in less than a day or why did you get two crowns um probably gets under six minutes five minutes maybe it's weird I don't even have access to the 40 by 41 so 40 by 30 uh alright let's let's boot up next game Jerma are we going
[101:37.02]That's a good game.
[101:38.48]It is really good.
[101:39.02]I'm telling you.
[101:40.02]In your off time, you boot up like the pick.
[101:43.41]The one on Switch is really good too.
[101:44.69]The S7.
[101:45.43]Are you just zoned out playing that?
[101:48.09]Just edging on the couch?
[101:49.41]It's so awesome.
[101:50.39]Because you can just have that like on your lap while you're watching TV or something.
[101:53.82]And it's just something that sits there.
[101:54.88]It's awesome.
[101:56.74]That sounds awesome.
[101:57.38]So where are we going?
[101:59.88]Super Auto Pets.
[102:01.92]Okay.
[102:02.46]So it's going to be two to two?
[102:05.00]Because there's no way I win this.
[102:06.23]Yeah.
[102:07.84]I will try.
[102:10.08]How do we play together?
[102:11.24]Are we just trying to get to... We're going against each other, yeah.
[102:14.18]Oh, really?
[102:14.72]Uh-huh.
[102:16.95]That's kind of cool.
[102:17.77]Is that new?
[102:19.21]They've had it, but it was a little laggy at the start.
[102:21.59]It's a little... We did the tournament this way.
[102:26.83]Oh, okay.
[102:27.65]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[102:30.42]I'm sending you a code.
[102:31.88]Do I need any of the expansions or anything?
[102:34.91]No.
[102:36.15]I think I have one of the first expansion pet pack.
[102:40.15]Yeah, that's the only one there is.
[102:41.95]Okay, cool.
[102:44.63]Hit it open.
[102:46.40]So you're still into this, huh?
[102:48.40]You're still into this game?
[102:49.12]Yeah, I've been seeing you playing it.
[102:50.76]They just released a new pack that has, like, there were 80 pets originally.

[104:04.92]We can talk during the battle.
[104:06.24]Okay.
[104:07.44]Okay, 13 seconds.
[104:07.76]Oh, there's also a timer at the bottom right and it's ticking down fast.
[104:09.86]Okay.
[104:17.37]I don't know.
[104:17.85]I don't know!
[104:18.33]I don't know.
[104:20.67]I honestly forgot how to play.
[104:21.85]I forgot everything about the game.
[104:23.67]Did you get a full?
[104:24.29]Oh, you got a full squad off.
[104:25.27]Okay.
[104:25.73]I was worried.
[104:26.55]Yeah.
[104:26.93]I kind of forgot everything.
[104:30.27]I mean, it's a great start.
[104:31.76]That is not a bad start.
[104:36.56]That's alright.
[104:36.92]I'll take a trade.
[104:40.75]How much time is on the clock for you?
[104:43.33]Uh... Seven seconds?
[104:46.17]Good, great, great, great.
[104:47.81]Excuse me?
[104:50.73]Excuse me?
[104:51.89]What?
[104:52.85]Did you get to even do your turn?
[104:53.87]I just put random shit up here.
[104:59.42]Yeah, that was a random bunch of shit.
[105:02.76]Let me double check to see the clock.
[105:06.27]I like it.
[105:06.97]You know what?
[105:07.35]No, no.
[105:08.60]My timer is stuck at 15.
[105:09.48]I'm going to redo.
[105:10.52]I'm going to redo.
[105:11.10]Alright.
[105:11.74]Alright.
[105:13.80]That's so funny.
[105:14.70]Okay.
[105:18.92]Turn on fast forward to get more time.
[105:20.76]I don't know what that means.
[105:26.49]I'll just give us 60 seconds per turn.
[105:29.73]Abandoned game?
[105:31.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[105:32.31]Abandoned.
[105:35.75]Same code, though.
[105:37.13]Same code.
[105:38.67]Is it available now?
[105:40.05]Should be.
[105:45.63]Oh, you are using the pay-to-win pack.
[105:47.59]I am?
[105:48.95]Which is fine.
[105:49.59]I think that's fine.
[105:50.49]Should I turn that off?
[105:51.42]I can turn it off.
[105:52.94]No, let me just also use it.
[105:53.98]We can both use it.
[105:54.58]Okay.
[105:58.88]Alright.
[106:00.08]Add an S at the end of the code, and it should be good now.
[106:04.48]Actually, no, no.
[106:06.73]I'm sorry.
[106:07.77]Don't go in?
[106:10.34]Add two S's at the end.
[106:13.04]Two S's?
[106:13.62]People are saying show your screen.
[106:15.30]Why do you think I'm not showing the screen between these things?
[106:17.60]Okay, I am in.
[106:22.14]Now you can show the screen, and we have about a minute per turn.
[106:25.30]Alright, perfect.
[106:25.88]Alright, good luck, man.
[106:27.34]Good luck, good luck.
[106:30.04]I mean, I'm not supposed to tell you a fucking story when I went to the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru, because I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
[106:37.13]How about this one?
[106:38.53]This bird?
[106:41.12]Buy food 1-1 until end of battle.
[106:43.72]Mosquito.
[106:45.96]I like that.
[106:46.56]Hold on.
[106:48.72]I can roll, right?
[106:50.15]How much money?
[106:50.89]What does it cost?
[106:51.61]3 to pick to get people?
[106:58.75]I know this is good.
[107:02.66]So then, end turn, give left-most friend one attack.
[107:09.86]I think that sounds fun.
[107:11.26]I mean, that's an oxymoron, right?
[107:25.15]Alright, what do you got?
[107:27.29]Honey?
[107:29.10]Oh, I went with the little honey play.
[107:30.52]Okay.
[107:37.27]That summons the bug.
[107:38.33]That's right.
[107:38.80]Alright.
[107:39.28]Okay.
[107:41.24]It's just a start.
[107:41.90]It's just the first part.
[107:42.64]It's fine.
[107:43.62]Early.
[107:44.12]It's early game.
[107:45.26]Yeah.
[107:46.38]You don't even see my screen right now, which is holy shit.
[107:48.69]The next turn is going to be unbelievable.
[107:50.11]See you in a minute.
[108:16.80]I don't know.
[108:21.15]This is random, so we're hoping it goes to the mosquito.
[108:26.83]Use the honey?
[108:27.71]What?
[108:27.87]How much does it cost?
[108:29.03]I thought it was three.
[108:34.17]Is it one?
[108:35.09]No, it's three.
[108:35.63]Yeah.
[108:35.73]Oh, right in the back.
[108:40.40]I see you doing fish strategy.
[108:41.62]I see.
[108:54.81]Take that one.
[108:59.71]Didn't even respond to me, he's still muted.
[109:01.25]Alright, this is, okay, hold on.
[109:10.02]Did I fuck that up?
[109:13.44]End turn, give five five to a friend ahead of, what?
[109:15.68]That sounds insane.
[109:24.04]I wanted to know I didn't ignore you.
[109:25.30]It was just, it was the longest piss I've ever done in my life.
[109:29.64]Oh fuck.
[109:31.30]Oh fuck.
[109:31.56]Oh fuck.
[109:31.84]Oh fuck.
[109:32.61]I don't know what that does.
[109:35.71]I think, I think I'm good.
[109:40.37]It's like awesome powers.
[109:41.51]It just kept coming.
[109:45.07]Oh my God.
[109:48.04]What a behemoth!
[109:49.04]You have a chick?
[109:49.82]What, are you practicing?
[109:53.30]Hey, I mean, when you tell me that we're doing a bro versus bro, I need to be at least somewhat prepared for it.
[110:00.69]Got to bring the A game, I guess.
[110:01.85]I took a bath last night.
[110:05.39]Where's the relevance?
[110:06.95]There is none.
[110:07.39]I haven't played this game in about four months.
[110:10.40]You take baths a lot?
[110:11.28]You a bath guy?
[110:12.00]I am.
[110:13.12]Are you a bath guy?
[110:14.36]I love taking baths.
[110:15.74]Really?
[110:17.04]Yes.
[110:17.84]What's your favorite Epsom salt flavor?
[110:19.44]That's an important question.
[110:20.76]I've been going to Himalayan recently.
[110:22.57]I like the orange one.
[110:25.65]Yeah, that's fair.
[110:27.77]I pretend I'm an athlete when I use the salts.
[110:32.63]You do in like a cold bath?
[110:35.11]No, it's warm, but I feel like the salt, it's like, oh, my muscles are rejuvenating.
[110:40.62]I have an athlete's heart rate.
[110:41.74]Did you know that?
[110:42.98]That's pretty sick.
[110:44.38]What's your resting?
[110:46.84]120?
[110:48.87]Whatever it is.
[110:49.41]100?
[110:49.45]Maybe 90?
[110:50.21]100?
[110:50.57]I have no idea.
[110:54.03]Mine's 40.
[110:55.77]You have a 40 resting heart rate?
[110:57.49]It's 47, yeah.
[110:58.39]No, you do not.
[110:59.41]I have a 47 resting heart rate, yeah.
[111:03.34]Are you lying?
[111:04.22]You just keep juicing this guy.
[111:05.98]I'm not lying to you.
[111:06.80]I got a 40 resting heart rate.
[111:07.76]Holy shit.
[111:10.68]Were you actually, like, an athlete?
[111:12.92]You know, I played on soccer teams.
[111:16.33]I was involved in the action.
[111:18.65]Actually, that's really, really good.
[111:24.01]I think my resting heart rate is probably 70, 75.
[111:27.98]I mean, I don't think that's great.
[111:29.82]I'm a neurotic fuck, though, dude.
[111:31.26]Like, I'm all over the place.
[111:34.05]In what sense?
[111:35.93]My heart rate just... My energy level just skyrockets and comes down and skyrockets.
[111:41.26]I'm kind of a mess.
[111:43.64]I feel that.
[111:44.20]I feel that.
[111:51.69]Are you a daily coffee drinker?
[111:54.79]Yes, I am.
[111:58.51]I quit recently.
[112:00.59]Somewhat quit.
[112:02.87]you do any other caffeinated beverages or did you just every day okay green or black uh black tea black tea black tea that's good oh this is where we get started this is where we get started rev it up rev it up rev it up baby oh slow it down slowly turn the engine off this is the comeback this is the comeback I needed
[112:31.12]I like green tea.
[112:32.20]You want me to prove it?
[112:35.52]You want me to prove it?
[112:36.86]Yeah, why would I need to prove that to you?
[112:40.04]Yeah, I don't know.
[112:41.48]Prove it.
[112:41.84]Prove that you like green tea to me.
[112:42.83]Yeah, dude, prove it.
[112:46.73]I want you to prove to me that you've drank green tea recently.
[112:53.92]That is so dumb.
[112:55.28]I apologize.
[112:55.66]Pull up my stream and I'll prove it to you right now that I'm a black tea guy.
[112:58.18]That you're a black tea drinker?
[113:00.22]Hold on.
[113:00.58]I need to.
[113:01.92]I gotta... Hold on a second.
[113:06.61]Do you want to see where I'm getting down with?
[113:09.25]What are you getting down with?
[113:12.05]You see this?
[113:12.91]Pull this bad boy up.
[113:14.93]I gotta pull the stream up.
[113:22.02]Why did it sign me out?
[113:28.44]Are you going to win here?
[113:31.36]Yes.
[113:31.76]I don't want to go over the game though.
[113:37.65]Oh, you're good.
[113:38.67]You're good.
[113:40.94]I gotta move it more towards your right.
[113:44.58]My right?
[113:45.74]My right?
[113:46.68]Wait, where are you sitting?
[113:48.46]I'm sitting... Why do you have... You're drinking a quad mug?
[113:51.74]Yeah, because I like... So I have one tea, it's English breakfast, but then I often drink Throat Goat, which is my other favorite tea.
[113:59.69]Dude, I thought you were... That's how you were drinking it.
[114:02.21]Like you were holding it like that and taking sips out of it.
[114:06.33]I go for the whole big picture.
[114:09.71]I go around.
[114:10.31]Oh my god.
[114:11.63]I have to play the game.
[114:13.61]You focus.
[114:14.09]I'm distracting you.
[114:16.11]Back to muting.
[114:22.11]Am I doing a homina?
[114:24.73]Why am I doing that?
[114:28.99]You're nervous.
[114:29.53]You're anxious.
[114:30.76]I was so confused.
[114:31.92]I wanted to see your teeth.
[114:36.72]So, do you like green?
[114:39.08]I like green tea.
[114:39.80]It just doesn't have enough caffeine.
[114:43.36]That I can justify.
[114:45.04]Yeah.
[114:46.54]No, I get it.
[114:51.49]Still using a 2-1 bird?
[114:53.71]You know, this game is so cool.
[115:00.13]It really is so much fun.
[115:10.54]Um, is this food?
[115:11.68]Okay.
[115:13.31]I mean, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[115:19.93]Is the lobster any good?
[115:21.65]Lobster's terrible.
[115:24.33]One of the worst, I would say.
[115:28.50]You could also hit the fast forward button during the fight, and then you get more time to play.
[115:34.06]Oh, you do?
[115:35.74]Yeah, because it actually, for whatever reason, because the game already knows inherently what happens.
[115:41.16]Oh, okay.
[115:41.60]So you get a little more time.
[115:42.46]It just starts the timer.
[115:43.46]It's kind of weird, but.
[115:44.36]How'd you get a 19, 24 blowfish?
[115:47.30]I fed it a lot of pears.
[115:48.55]That skunk was a great decision.
[115:51.03]Yep.
[115:51.69]That's what I was thinking.
[115:54.31]I think it's a narrow victory.
[115:56.63]Narrow.
[116:03.07]Ooh.
[116:04.49]Unfortunate.
[116:10.11]If I lose one more, I'm done.
[116:12.76]It's a quick GG, yeah.
[116:15.02]Alright, this is where I really, really get involved here.
[116:31.16]What?
[116:32.52]What?
[116:33.12]What happened?
[116:33.70]Why?
[116:34.31]Why didn't I do the thing?
[116:35.01]He's supposed to give us power.
[116:36.95]Wait, who did you pill?
[116:38.09]Don't tell me you pulled something.
[116:40.25]Oh, I sold it.
[116:40.89]I didn't pill it.
[116:41.65]Oops.
[116:44.22]I thought selling did the same thing.
[116:50.10]I'm noticing this time crunch.
[116:51.56]Is it the best for you?
[116:55.44]I sold the ant.
[116:56.46]I didn't kill the ant.
[116:57.66]I thought it was the same thing.
[117:00.08]Oh, this is bad.
[117:00.98]Hey, well, I got pick Ross.
[117:02.30]You got super auto set.
[117:03.26]Yeah, you know what?
[117:04.66]Come on.
[117:04.89]I got to win one, right?
[117:06.27]It's my game.
[117:09.63]Alright.
[117:10.09]Alright.
[117:10.49]Alright.
[117:10.87]Alright.
[117:11.23]Hey, it was an excellent bout.
[117:13.07]This game is fun, though.
[117:14.41]I like this game a lot.
[117:16.59]Three to two, Jermo.
[117:18.01]You actually did inspire me in this game.
[117:20.20]I did.
[117:20.36]With your hedgehog shenanigans.
[117:24.27]Oh, yeah.
[117:24.77]You did the triple hedgehog, right?
[117:26.95]Uh-huh.
[117:27.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[117:29.70]So, are we doing... Is that this one?
[117:32.86]It is... Say it again.
[117:33.88]That's a different pack.
[117:35.67]Are we doing another one?
[117:37.81]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[117:39.33]It's your turn.
[117:40.31]Your pick.
[117:40.73]Your pick of a game.
[117:41.93]Alright.
[117:42.17]Three to two, and you have one game left, I believe.
[117:44.77]I do have one game left, and I feel like it's going to be a bit... So, it's the first person to get to three wins?
[117:49.81]Three, like, game wins?
[117:51.88]Five.
[117:52.44]Five, because I'm at three right now.
[117:53.64]So, I'm at three, you're at two.
[117:56.60]So, House Flipper is the last game that I have picked.
[118:00.52]Mm-hmm.
[118:01.62]And we're going to need a third party.
[118:03.69]ConnorEatsPants DM me.
[118:05.25]Okay.
[118:06.05]He's ready, able, and willing for the cause.
[118:08.51]So we're going to have to set a time limit.
[118:11.86]I think 15... Is 15 too short?
[118:14.09]Maybe 30?
[118:14.75]I would say at least 20 to 25 minutes.
[118:18.87]Let's do... I mean, I'm happy to do 30.
[118:20.55]I think that'd be probably best.
[118:22.99]Knight's still young.
[118:23.53]It's only 5.
[118:24.41]Knight is still young.
[118:25.92]Congratulations on your Super Auto Pets win.
[118:28.90]Thank you.
[118:29.46]Thank you.
[118:30.00]You know, I thought I'd speed that up so we have more time for House Flipper.
[118:32.86]I mean, this is going to be great.
[118:33.86]I feel like this is going to be... So, have you played House Flipper before?
[118:36.46]No.
[118:37.26]I have three hours in the game.
[118:38.73]I watched Clint Stevens play it about four years ago, and I played it too for about 40 viewers.
[118:44.23]And that's my history of House Flipper.
[118:47.53]What's yours?
[118:48.34]I mean, this is one of my top streamed games.
[118:51.82]Ever?
[118:52.48]Ever.
[118:53.82]More than like your numerous, numerous hours in Blackjack?
[118:59.61]No.
[119:00.63]This is one of my favorite games ever made.
[119:02.91]You have a disgusting amount of hours in Blackjack.
[119:04.57]You know that, right?
[119:05.51]I have a lot.
[119:06.69]Disgusting is, I think, a little harsh.
[119:08.57]Gross.
[119:10.35]It's like 6,000 to 7,000 hours.
[119:12.73]People play League of Legends for like 10,000 hours.
[119:14.54]It's not a big deal.
[119:15.30]Dripping in hours.
[119:18.96]Alright, so you know how to... There's not... Okay, the competition here is who can make a cooler looking house.
[119:24.98]Right.
[119:25.36]It's not like gamer skills or anything.
[119:27.32]This is just like your design skills.
[119:30.44]This is, like, from the heart.
[119:32.44]Yeah.
[119:32.84]Make something beautiful.
[119:34.85]I have a feeling that you're going to be pretty good on this.
[119:38.03]I'm not kind of hoping, but we'll see.
[119:39.91]So we have the third party that we're going to do a walkthrough, and they're going to pick which house is better.
[119:44.24]Which house is better looking, more well-designed, right?
[119:47.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:49.14]The better house.
[119:50.58]So we need to pick a house that's small.
[119:54.98]Yeah, let me see.
[119:57.24]I'm booting in right now.
[119:58.83]You all up to date here?
[120:00.97]You got all your tools and money and everything?
[120:04.11]Let me double check.
[120:05.23]I should, right?
[120:05.89]Because I think I went offline mode, which was my one problem.
[120:09.33]Okay, that's a terrible start.
[120:13.49]Oh!
[120:14.67]I can't believe that worked.
[120:15.31]Did it work?
[120:16.05]Alright, if I hit continue game, what happens?
[120:22.44]How much money do you got?
[120:25.70]280,000.
[120:25.72]There you go.
[120:27.62]Alright.
[120:28.18]So.
[120:28.76]And only my hand?
[120:31.19]You only have your hand?
[120:32.05]Well, here you probably only have your hand.
[120:33.63]Well, no, if you hold down right click, you should have pretty much everything.
[120:35.93]I'm seeing one big old hand.
[120:39.45]He just got the hand.
[120:40.99]I added your files.
[120:42.64]Yeah, so you should have.
[120:44.10]You should have all the tools here.
[120:46.32]You don't have a flamethrower?
[120:50.88]Say it again?
[120:54.23]Let me go to the burned house and see if maybe things are different.
[120:57.02]Maybe the abandoned house?
[120:59.68]Let me go to the abandoned house and see what's going on over there.
[121:02.72]It might take you a second or two.
[121:07.40]You might have to do the missions, though, to unlock the tools, right?
[121:12.30]No, I know how to do this.
[121:13.67]This shouldn't take me more than 15 to 20 seconds max.
[121:16.33]Okay.
[121:17.81]So we need to pick a house that's small.
[121:20.87]It's not going to take us like two hours to do.
[121:23.28]Yes.
[121:24.94]What is your recommendation?
[121:26.00]Where does your heart lead you?
[121:27.42]I would say if you go to, when you go to the laptop and you go to browse, like for purchase.
[121:32.61]Uh-huh.
[121:34.15]We're talking about maybe the many generations house or the home.
[121:39.39]Slightly larger.
[121:40.11]Do you want to go bigger?
[121:41.55]We can go bigger.
[121:42.45]No, that's what I mean.
[121:43.77]It's slightly larger.
[121:44.39]I was thinking abandoned or the burned house.
[121:48.87]A home admin legends could be fine too.
[121:52.70]I think that's great.
[121:53.48]I'm down.
[121:54.16]Let's do the home admin legend.
[121:56.23]Home admin legends?
[121:58.17]Yeah.
[121:58.67]Okay, great.
[121:59.83]Great, great, great.
[122:03.71]Actually, that might be too small.
[122:06.76]Let's do... Hmm.
[122:13.42]Maybe the one to move into might be good.
[122:15.10]Now this apartment.
[122:16.86]We gotta find one that's got enough that we can really design stuff in.
[122:19.99]Uh-huh.
[122:22.24]I mean, this is like the Breaking Bad house.
[122:24.74]Right?
[122:26.65]The Breaking Bad house?
[122:29.33]Yeah, it's like a reference to Breaking Bad.
[122:32.57]What about the century old house?
[122:35.11]Like a real one, not a contrived one?
[122:39.41]Okay, the century house, I think, is where we're going to go here.
[122:43.26]That's big enough.
[122:43.76]It's got two floors.
[122:44.62]Got a big living area.
[122:47.84]I think this is good.
[122:50.41]Alright, I'm coming in hot.
[122:51.21]I'm coming in hot.
[122:52.01]This surely worked.
[122:57.18]And you're going to buy that house?
[122:59.30]The century-old house, and then you're going to go there.
[123:01.92]I'm not going to touch anything, by the way.
[123:04.48]Is this a Germanism?
[123:07.00]My chat just became Jerma.
[123:10.08]Wait, you just... Does that happen to you ever?
[123:13.15]You're reading Jerma in your chat?
[123:14.61]Yeah, everyone's speaking in Jerma.
[123:18.15]What?
[123:19.11]I don't know if that's one of those Jerma things.
[123:20.89]It's like, ah, it's time to speak Jerma, everybody.
[123:24.08]Not that I'm aware of.
[123:25.12]I hope that didn't start it.
[123:29.54]Or did you change your language on, like, the little cogwheel?
[123:36.39]No, no, it's like, it's auto-correcting.
[123:39.23]Yeah.
[123:40.15]No, they're just speaking good old-fashioned Jerma.
[123:43.53]Really?
[123:43.83]Okay, interesting.
[123:45.87]Alright.
[123:46.21]Alright.
[123:46.43]Let's see the house we're going with.
[123:48.19]By the way, I want to make this really clear.
[123:50.13]Outside and inside.
[123:53.09]Outside and inside.
[123:53.95]Outside and inside.
[123:54.45]Be aware of that because whoever, you know, Connor walks through.
[123:57.15]How's your yard look?
[123:59.70]How's the front door look?
[124:00.78]Many generations house.
[124:01.88]I think that's good.
[124:04.16]Many generations.
[124:04.90]I think it's a good house.
[124:09.16]Are we running that one?
[124:10.46]That's the one, yeah.
[124:11.82]And then I have not moved.
[124:14.28]Alright.
[124:14.96]I don't think I have many tools, but I also don't need many tools.
[124:18.22]Do you have access to painting, tiling, demolition, brush cutter?
[124:27.91]Huh?
[124:28.63]Brush cutter?
[124:29.49]So I got my hands.
[124:33.65]And a good work ethic.
[124:36.49]Wait, wrong house?
[124:37.31]Wait, it was the Many Generations house.
[124:38.73]Wait, did I do the wrong house?
[124:40.75]Oh, maybe I said that and that's not what it was.
[124:44.09]Oh, Ludwig said the wrong house.
[124:45.37]Oh.
[124:46.99]Oh, I just said the wrong house and you disagreed with me.
[124:49.31]Oh, century old house.
[124:50.51]Is that, what did I say?
[124:51.19]Uh, it is supposed to be the Many Generations, not the Many, it's the century house.
[124:59.58]You need to be able to clean and stuff.
[125:01.88]Oh, look at this, the Turtle House.
[125:05.09]If you don't have access to your tools, you're not going to be able to do it.
[125:08.47]I can clean everything.
[125:10.22]I can pick things up.
[125:11.96]Wait, which house is it?
[125:13.44]Unless you have the specific mop, I don't think you can do it.
[125:16.02]What was this house again?
[125:19.73]Century old house.
[125:23.05]How expensive are we talking?
[125:25.05]Like $100,000?
[125:28.75]gonna run me out yeah you might be able to go I think you can go into your like config file and give yourself all the tools yeah that's what I was trying to do um I I yeah I gave him my save but it won't it for some reason the tools won't click um many century chat chat am I dumb is there a house here am I just missing it century am I am I stupid let me see
[125:59.60]is this DLC oh this might be a DLC house okay that changes things then you have a DLC house I own all the DLC for this game alright so that might yeah that is DLC it is yeah yeah yeah okay okay so let's do what what do you have access to what's like the biggest house you have access to uh the biggest house
[126:20.61]The absolute largest is the house on the castle or the house on the moon, just married.
[126:25.63]But the ones that I think would be good for this would be like the home and car, turtle house, you know, the boring house.
[126:34.48]That's a fun one because then you have to spruce it up.
[126:36.64]I wanted to flip the turtle house.
[126:39.88]Turtle house is small though.
[126:42.47]But we only have 30 minutes.
[126:43.91]That's true.
[126:44.77]You're right.
[126:45.25]We don't have all day.
[126:47.17]Which one is bigger?
[126:48.07]Turtle House or the one to flip?
[126:49.99]I think... Do I have the one to flip?
[126:54.02]We'll do Turtle.
[126:55.50]Turtle's very easy.
[126:57.04]I'm just concerned you don't have access to tools.
[127:01.02]Let me get into it and then see.
[127:05.02]Let me go there and see.
[127:05.80]Goku?
[127:14.23]Yeah, because if you don't have access to the painting tool, then, I mean, you can't paint the walls.
[127:20.18]Yeah, all I can do is lift things and move them around.
[127:23.24]Oh, no.
[127:25.08]I'll just readjust where everything... Cleaning not available yet.
[127:28.10]That's absurd.
[127:28.82]Okay, okay.
[127:30.03]Yeah.
[127:30.51]I thought I had it earlier.
[127:32.03]There's missions you can do that unlock all the tools, but it takes like 45 minutes.
[127:35.37]Right, right, right, right.
[127:37.79]That save file I gave you should work, but I don't know why it's not.
[127:41.24]It's supposed to work in the sense that it's supposed to give you the tools?
[127:44.64]You're just supposed to have my save file, essentially.
[127:48.06]Right.
[127:48.62]Okay.
[127:49.44]Let me give it one more console command.
[127:51.98]Is there a console here?
[127:52.90]Is there a console command?
[127:54.96]Oh, is there really?
[127:55.63]Okay.
[127:57.61]How do you enable console commands?
[127:59.63]Because I used to do it with an INI file.
[128:03.15]Oh, you don't have the DLC, so the save won't work.
[128:07.38]that's what it is okay that makes sense alright let me buy the DLC then either either that or there's somebody's people saying there's console commands that I don't necessarily go into your save game
[128:26.01]Press tilde and enter... Press... What the fuck is that?
[128:30.99]Enter the code IDDQD.
[128:33.12]Leave the pause screen.
[128:34.36]Cheats are now enabled.
[128:35.62]To open console, just press that little tilde.
[128:43.14]Have you tried this?
[128:44.62]I have not.
[128:45.06]I don't know what this is.
[128:46.73]Is that... You're not fucking around with this, right?
[128:48.59]That actually works?
[128:49.45]I have to get all the DLCs?
[128:53.32]I would try the IDD.
[128:54.80]Let me try this guy.
[128:57.58]Am I just saying something out loud that was bad?
[128:59.34]There's like five DLCs.
[129:02.22]What is this?
[129:05.70]Okay, press tilde and enter the code.
[129:08.72]In the game.
[129:09.76]Yeah, so I guess in the game.
[129:11.16]Can you open up the dev console?
[129:12.82]I'm booting in.
[129:17.29]That's the fucking Doom code.
[129:18.55]Never mind.
[129:20.35]Oh, it's a bit of a meme here.
[129:23.58]Yeah, I think you are right that it's through the system files.
[129:27.65]I know you can do it through the system files, but it might be a little too much stalling for this remainder of this afternoon here.
[129:34.75]Oh, there is a code, though, if you put in tilde.
[129:37.91]Hmm.
[129:40.51]Is there a code that you can... What's a good code?
[129:45.46]We have a few.
[129:46.72]The IDDQ thing isn't fake.
[129:48.74]That's real.
[129:49.48]Wait, is it real?
[129:50.12]Why are people saying that was the Doom code?
[129:54.47]Okay.
[129:54.89]Google House Flipper unlock all tools command.
[130:00.05]Okay.
[130:00.65]I think we're making progress.
[130:01.95]Okay.
[130:02.13]Cool.
[130:02.33]Very cool.
[130:03.11]Because now what I'm supposed to do is hit... Cheats are now enabled to open the console.
[130:10.67]Press this in game.
[130:13.33]Be careful.
[130:13.71]I was going to say be careful opening a dev console.
[130:18.19]What happened?
[130:19.35]Nothing.
[130:19.67]You just worried me.
[130:22.38]And then...
[130:24.34]I'm saying, I don't know what it's going to show.
[130:26.12]Like, I would just, I don't know.
[130:27.48]Who knows?
[130:28.00]Right, right, right.
[130:28.62]If I hit, apparently, if I have this code, and then I hit F3, I get all the tools.
[130:34.35]Did you get them?
[130:35.57]And then if I hit F5, I get all the money.
[130:38.43]Oh!
[130:38.49]Alright, we're in business.
[130:41.73]And then F8 improves all the tools.
[130:43.98]Oh!
[130:47.78]That's great.
[130:49.32]Are we in business?
[130:50.70]Oh, we're in business.
[130:51.56]We are in, I have everything now.
[130:54.36]Alright.
[130:54.66]Awesome.
[130:55.10]Perfect.
[130:55.96]So, um, so let me give you a quick little rundown of House Flipper.
[130:59.36]So you see, you have a grid, you have, it should be like a, it looks like the house is on bricks and a foundation.
[131:04.90]it's like a 10 by 10 sometimes 15 by 15 the grid on the foundation and you'll see these numbers that correspond to where you need to place your tiling and if you see on the left side there's like a four a three and a two you need there has to be at least one tile on the ground alright let's just go before I embarrass myself anymore um okay yeah understood noted noted
[131:28.68]Alright, so timer starts now?
[131:30.84]You actually know how to play?
[131:31.58]Because there's like a specific stupid shit that you need to... Like, you have to clean with the mop.
[131:35.68]You can't use your hands.
[131:36.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[131:38.06]Hey, me?
[131:39.22]Come on.
[131:40.04]Talking to Mr. House Flipper.
[131:41.88]I'm excited.
[131:42.46]I'm really.
[131:42.90]Alright, so you need to make this look as dazzling and beautiful as possible.
[131:46.93]Connor's coming in.
[131:48.33]Bingo.
[131:50.13]Connor's coming in, and he wants the best house possible.
[131:53.41]Okay.
[131:54.11]Let's get to it.
[131:55.61]Timer starts now.
[131:56.31]Good luck.
[131:56.99]Goodbye.
[131:59.78]Okay, here we go.
[132:00.72]First of all, get rid of this shit.
[132:03.22]We gotta cut this grass.
[132:05.16]He's gonna forget about the fucking lawn, and mine's gonna look incredible.
[132:09.26]He is going to completely neglect and completely forget the lawn.
[132:14.95]Connor's gonna look over and he's gonna be like, this is disgustingly ugly.
[132:18.31]By the way, Connor, I hope you're gonna be very, very, um, thorough.
[132:30.51]What was that?
[132:34.75]What the fuck was that?
[132:35.43]Okay, that looks alright.
[132:38.13]Make sure there's nothing around the back.
[132:43.59]That was a Dragon Ball?
[132:46.43]Why?
[132:49.61]He's gonna go in there and, look, Ludwig is gonna have a ten minute debacle where he can't figure out what kind of couch he's picking while his lawn is uncut.
[132:59.04]Do this first.
[133:04.16]I don't give a shit about the couch.
[133:07.02]All an interior really is, is like the accent walls and a chandelier.
[133:11.54]And you wow... Wait, I gotta stop talking.
[133:13.52]Connor might be watching.
[133:22.87]Connor can't watch these streams.
[133:25.03]He needs to be completely... He needs to not know anything.
[133:28.64]Okay, looks good.
[133:35.18]No weeds, right?
[133:36.52]Right here, get rid of that.
[133:37.24]I'm gonna plant a couple trees.
[133:44.55]I'm telling you, he's gonna, he is going to neglect the fuck out of his front, out front, outside.
[133:49.61]Garden.
[133:54.06]Oh my god, I'm not gonna be a streamer in there.
[133:56.12]Plants, let's go, let's go.
[133:57.18]How about, let's, something.
[134:00.54]Um, let's do these.
[134:04.22]Oh yeah, let's go.
[134:13.68]Look at that.
[134:15.36]Already perfect.
[134:25.18]Not bad.
[134:26.01]Gonna extend this out a little bit with some gravel.
[134:30.77]We need, uh... We need outside.
[134:32.57]We need floor.
[134:36.95]We need outside shit.
[134:38.23]Here we go.
[134:42.59]Floor coverings.
[134:43.83]I just want stone.
[134:45.85]I want crushed stone.
[134:49.19]Where is crushed stone?
[134:53.02]Stone.
[134:55.22]Where's crushed stone?
[135:01.54]Where is it?
[135:05.77]It's like...
[135:13.34]Where is it?
[135:13.82]What the fuck?
[135:17.74]They're not gonna fucking... They're not gonna tell the difference, so who cares?
[135:20.34]Cobblestone, here it is.
[135:26.55]Delete that.
[135:27.19]Delete that.
[135:27.57]Delete that.
[135:27.89]Delete that.
[135:29.49]Why am I fucking Santa Claus?
[135:45.61]Alright, I just want a little bit more of a bedazzle.
[135:52.64]It's all about first impressions.
[136:00.34]I'm gonna put like a nice thing of flowers here, right there.
[136:02.99]It's a first impression.
[136:19.39]Okay, that's alright.
[136:21.37]Line that with flowers.
[136:22.11]I need to, like, delete this.
[136:30.21]Let's take care of the outside, the paint on the outside.
[136:32.88]Hold on.
[136:34.34]Alright.
[136:35.52]Maybe something funky, right?
[136:37.02]Something funky.
[136:39.12]Somebody said Connor is too dumb to notice that.
[136:44.86]Hunter is like an incredibly intelligent young man, okay?
[136:48.56]Um, excuse me.
[136:55.88]Alright, what's something that doesn't scream, I'm trying too hard to make the judge like me, but is pizzazzy enough where it's going to stand out?
[137:06.65]I'm going to say the outside of the house is going to be fresh morning, this thing right here.
[137:13.03]A fresh morning.
[137:23.49]How's that look?
[137:28.79]I don't like it.
[137:29.49]No, it's alright.
[137:29.97]It's fine.
[137:30.19]It's fine.
[137:30.39]It's fine.
[137:30.91]Is it fine?
[137:31.45]It's fine.
[137:32.51]That is it.
[137:33.29]Is that an awful color?
[137:34.33]I can't tell.
[137:34.73]What's Connor's favorite color?
[137:37.63]Does anybody know?
[137:38.57]Who here watches Connor's stream regularly?
[137:40.87]What's his favorite color?
[137:46.97]I'm gonna say it's probably, like, blue, right?
[137:48.69]Just put all of Connor's favorite things in the house.
[137:52.48]Like, just have them on tables and shit.
[137:56.00]Is it blue?
[137:57.28]Okay, yeah, we're going blue.
[137:58.65]We're going fucking, like, bright blue.
[138:06.55]Uh, paint.
[138:07.69]Blue.
[138:08.56]But isn't that wicked ugly?
[138:15.74]Oh, that's right.
[138:16.46]He does.
[138:16.78]He loves Sonic the Hedgehog.
[138:22.71]I'm playing to... I'm playing to strength here.
[138:26.91]He loves Sonic the Hedgehog.
[138:30.32]I remember, yeah, we took an Uber together at the Streamer Awards.
[138:32.58]I remember we had, um, headphones in, like, uh, AirPods.
[138:37.75]And he was just, like, sitting there, like, fucking going like this, like, pumping himself up, uh, and just, like, hanging out.
[138:42.05]And we were like, oh, shit, why don't we... And all you could hear was, like, blasting in his ears.
[138:45.69]It was like, Sonic Heroes!
[138:48.50]I was like, that's a good song.
[138:59.63]That's based, oh yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[139:05.45]I gotta get up higher.
[139:06.81]This house is fucking ugly.
[139:13.63]I'm really curious what he is doing over there.
[139:17.09]I can't wait to find out.
[139:19.87]This, what a fun, I, this is, I like this idea.
[139:23.95]Is you give two people like 30 minutes to like 40 minutes to flip a house.
[139:28.52]And then somebody, a third party has to come in.
[139:30.96]I love this.
[139:31.44]This is fun.
[139:32.04]I like this a lot.
[139:40.75]I think we're going to be time efficient here.
[139:51.93]I know he's going to neglect so much shit.
[139:55.38]He's probably, like, walking around with a flamethrower, like, laughing, right?
[139:58.53]Like, he's gonna have to be.
[139:59.75]That's what I did when I first got the flamethrower.
[140:01.45]He didn't have the flamethrower before, no way.
[140:10.66]Look, you might be thinking I'm wasting time on the exterior.
[140:13.38]I don't think so.
[140:17.04]The interior is easy.
[140:18.98]It's out here.
[140:20.48]The first impression that matters the absolute most.
[140:25.79]I need to get a scaffolding.
[140:26.59]Fuck, this is gonna take like, this is gonna take the whole time.
[140:42.72]How long have we been doing this for?
[140:44.66]You're wasting time.
[140:45.48]How long, how long, how much longer do I have?
[140:52.80]Nine minutes?! !
[140:54.98]What do you mean nine minutes?
[140:59.00]I have 20.
[141:00.12]Okay, it's been.
[141:00.92]Okay, I have 20 minutes.
[141:03.27]That's plenty of time to get in there and whoosh it up a little bit.
[141:12.17]Delete the rocks.
[141:17.58]I have unlimited money, so who cares?
[141:22.82]Also, huge tip.
[141:26.07]I gotta get rid of these paint cans and shit, because that's an eyesore.
[141:29.61]That's a big problem, and I don't think Ludwig's gonna do that.
[141:34.37]Oh, like the debris and shit that you- Yeah.

[162:23.70]Is this the wrong way?
[162:26.86]I gotta flip this.
[162:27.42]It's the wrong way.
[162:29.62]Imagine you get an order to make this in somebody's house and you build it the fucking wrong direction.
[162:37.26]That's got to be flush.
[162:38.02]Connor is going to be very detailed.
[162:43.25]Nice.
[162:43.71]Good.
[162:43.95]We need a fridge.

[163:26.28]This will brighten it up a little bit.
[163:27.44]Yep, this will brighten it up.
[163:33.06]This looks like an operating room.
[163:35.26]No.
[163:36.38]No, no.
[163:36.86]I only have like eight minutes.
[163:42.66]Hmm.
[163:46.86]I don't... I like... I kind of like that color.
[163:53.06]Where's the TV gonna go?
[163:55.61]This is too big.
[163:56.27]Oh, fuck.
[164:00.27]That's too big.
[164:01.13]It's a ping pong table.
[164:10.48]Countess table?
[164:14.29]That's a detail that somebody will overlook.
[164:15.73]That's a cutting board.
[164:16.27]How about like a round table?
[164:24.92]Round table auto!
[164:25.98]Oh my god.
[164:26.90]Perfect.

[164:51.14]These are fine.
[165:02.96]Whatever, it doesn't matter.

[165:08.10]I gotta close these.
[165:09.72]Fuck, I need to paint the walls.
[165:10.93]I need a different floor.
[165:11.63]We need carpets and shit.
[165:12.47]I need a bed.
[165:13.65]How much time is left?
[165:14.35]It's a big Dracula bed.
[165:21.43]Alright, I'm doing a huge Dracula bed.

[166:17.58]It says what?

[174:36.08]I know it's been stressful.
[174:38.26]Do you want to wrap maybe like another, what is it, two minutes left?
[174:42.95]43, 30 is on my clock, maybe 45, 30.
[174:44.85]How are you doing?
[174:46.43]Do you think you want an extra two or three minutes?
[174:48.77]I mean, I've been done for like a little bit here, but I'm happy to.

[175:34.75]Question.
[175:35.99]Alright.
[175:36.21]So you got to start from outside the house.
[175:40.99]Standing where the beach is.
[175:43.13]Right.
[175:43.35]Okay.
[175:45.19]And we're going to have Connor.
[175:47.86]He can open up each one of our streams.
[175:48.98]He can bring them in this call.
[175:51.20]And we will individually do a nice slow walkthrough of our property.
[175:58.18]And from there, Connor can decide who has the better designed house.
[176:04.62]I think that sounds excellent to me.
[176:06.81]And pencils down, by the way.
[176:08.95]Right now, pencils down?
[176:09.77]Pencils down.
[176:11.01]What about one plumbing system, though?
[176:13.79]Pencils down.
[176:14.85]Pencils down.
[176:16.02]Pencils down.
[176:16.76]I don't need another pencil.
[176:17.88]You don't need any more.
[176:18.90]You don't have to sharpen it.
[176:20.00]We're good.
[176:21.66]Alright.
[176:22.48]Alright, alright, alright.
[176:23.68]Pencils down.
[176:24.34]I'm outside my house.
[176:25.04]I'm ready to go.
[176:26.10]I'll bring Connor on the call.
[176:27.16]Do we want to do yours first or mine first?
[176:30.40]Let's do a tour of... I made you go first earlier.
[176:33.74]We can do mine if you'd like.
[176:35.16]Let me open your stream.
[176:37.28]I'll Discord screen share.
[176:38.70]If that's easier for you.
[176:39.80]Hey, guys.
[176:42.08]Connor!
[176:42.40]One second.
[176:42.72]I need some water.
[176:43.44]I'm a little anxious.
[176:44.50]Give me water.
[176:45.61]Yeah.
[176:45.87]I got your stream.
[176:46.55]I got it.
[176:47.47]Is he okay?
[176:48.47]I think he's okay.
[176:51.25]He's very nervous it sounds.
[176:52.37]I haven't heard him like that in a long time.
[176:55.01]What's up, dude?
[176:56.31]I'm doing good.
[176:57.17]I'm ready to judge.
[176:59.23]I'm just... I'm so ready.
[177:01.07]I'm kind of nervous too if I'm honest.
[177:03.99]You alright?
[177:04.87]I don't know.
[177:07.60]how's it going what's what's like online uh for this entire contest if he loses he has to play smite on stream and uh and if I lose I have to play toontown oh so oh okay if you prefer Connor do you know what you're doing here yeah I have to like I have to figure out turn you up I don't know how to work audio the audio is dumb
[177:34.34]uh yeah basically Connor is here as our representative uh who who will be who will be judging which house is the best um based off the the constraints given the house we had in the time given okay your job is to come in here and just complete independent third party we're gonna give you a walk through of both houses
[178:00.79]And you are to determine whose is better.
[178:04.65]Sounds good.
[178:05.45]Does two minutes on the clock for a walkthrough sound fair to you, Jerma?
[178:09.41]Do I watch a stream or am I able to do it in like, do I have to boot up my own house?
[178:12.69]I think a solid three minutes.
[178:14.33]Three minutes.
[178:14.75]Three minutes sounds great.
[178:15.75]I'm Discord screen sharing, but also my stream, it's up to you.
[178:18.70]I imagine Discord screen sharing might be a bit easier.
[178:21.32]Yeah.
[178:22.94]I'll cover Ludwig's face with my face because your audio is delayed because I'm watching your stream.
[178:30.39]uh and if I can start can I go or let me know when you're ready Connor okay I'm ready alright let me let me get my timer set a timer for three minutes okay great um Connor welcome
[178:46.48]to our house which we've called um relax as you can see when you walk in there's an accent wall um two accent walls in fact because I wanted to I wanted it to be like a like a dream house right this to make you remember what it was like being young you know oh so let's let's actually head down walking in I don't want to reveal too much if we look to our right you can see we have a television a nice little this reminds me of my dad
[179:15.01]couch yeah yeah you might notice the gun um we just like a little bit of safety I guess a little bit of safety uh we'll turn here and we have some nice bonsai trees um just to decompress um and and we'll keep moving over here's the kitchen area now again turn off the flashlight
[179:35.09]oh sorry yeah oh yeah there's like a big like Resident Evil my bad sorry I'm so stressed there you go this is the kitchen this is the kitchen very pink themed again very very relaxed base so we have our our fridge here we have our microwave right this is you know but but but also hold on okay wait a minute why is the microwave just like on like a children's table
[179:56.80]It's because we actually have a really short member living in this house.
[180:00.80]Also, I don't know why I pointed out that it was on the children's table, not that there is a pistol sitting on the microwave.
[180:06.32]Safety is key.
[180:07.42]So we have this as our main kitchenette area.
[180:11.10]There's a stove, a sink.
[180:13.07]We'll ignore that.
[180:14.07]Now, let's move over to the bathroom.
[180:16.33]So we have his and hers.
[180:19.09]His, I can see, you're breathtaking.

[180:24.21]And then hers...
[180:25.79]it's it's you know it's a little girls would like that that's a good girl toilet but it also has safety considerations because I understand this is a turret I understand that it's it's it's it's it's scarier it's scary women have been asking for that they've been like they've been asking for like solutions to the problems you know where's the wall do you like streaming Connor uh it's open floor pan I think I do I enjoy it check this out

[182:47.31]Okay.
[182:48.17]Here we go.
[182:48.58]Connor, hi, welcome to the house.
[182:50.08]The first thing you notice.
[182:50.98]I like the Christmas, like, price gun.
[182:53.53]Exactly.
[182:54.17]First of all.
[182:54.85]Right.
[182:55.35]Points already.
[182:56.45]So as you notice, we're on the beach.
[182:58.21]We don't have to spend too much time in that.
[182:59.41]But as you see, I have a nice cobblestone walkway leading towards two relics that have been lit up pretty well.
[183:06.51]Those are very, very, very, very expensive bronze statues.
[183:09.93]How are you doing?
[183:11.83]You know, it's a thing that we ask every time somebody comes.
[183:14.07]It's like it's like welcoming.
[183:15.39]Like, you know, you know what it's about.
[183:17.33]So you're feeding into them a little bit.
[183:18.61]We want people to come in and tell us how they're doing.
[183:21.25]Right.
[183:21.57]And hopefully we're doing well.
[183:23.45]I got a cool a painting of I don't know.
[183:25.84]I don't know who that is.
[183:26.60]It just was expensive Come in the front door as you see pretty beautiful plan here We've got the the mustard walls got a little bit of this is smart TV, by the way I don't think Ludwig had a smart TV in his house.
[183:38.67]I had a curved monitor, which I mean that's kind of a meme, isn't it?
[183:41.95]Yeah, I don't really get the application of those Really impartial not really impartial He's right
[183:50.71]I mean, the kitchen, it's a small kitchen, but, you know, the big coup de grâce here is this is a sauna.
[183:55.51]Smart TVs cause cancer.
[183:57.31]So this is a nice sauna.
[183:58.37]You can get in here, sit down, relax, turn on.
[184:00.71]Have you ever been to a sauna before?
[184:02.69]No, he thought about that, though, because saunas prevent cancer.
[184:05.68]So if you go to the smart TV, you can walk in the sauna and then you're fine.
[184:08.82]And then you can sweat out all the talking and everything.
[184:12.04]Beach.
[184:12.66]Yep.
[184:12.96]Fucking beach.
[184:13.52]It's really nice.
[184:13.96]This door.
[184:14.22]Go outside.
[184:14.48]Okay.
[184:17.30]That is, um, don't forget about the fact that this is like an apartment door.
[184:21.41]I think it was cool.
[184:22.67]Number 12.
[184:23.69]Bathroom's in there.
[184:24.43]Yeah, who fucking cares about the bathroom?
[184:25.97]Bathrooms are dumb anyways.
[184:27.44]Uh, this is just a little- Well, let's take a look inside.
[184:29.76]You can hang your coat over there if you wanted.
[184:32.04]Is that the toilet?
[184:34.30]What's that blue paint splotch?
[184:35.99]it's where that's not it was just somebody that's it's an accident that's here's the sink that's great yeah toilet paper this is a state-of-the-art uh oh it's one of those nice toilets it is I like the yeah it's on the wall the shower for me I walk in the shower sure yeah
[184:53.97]There's like some exposed plumbing in some spots.
[185:02.64]It's hard to get out of, but this, by the way, this door is fucking tiny.
[185:06.36]It's like a his and hers shower.
[185:08.16]Yeah.
[185:09.62]It's at any... Wherever.
[185:11.88]Okay, here we go.
[185:13.21]Down here into the... This is just a bedroom area.
[185:16.35]I got your... This is also a smart TV.
[185:19.09]And you got the big... Be careful.
[185:22.29]Master bedroom.
[185:24.60]Really, it's up to you what you want to put in here if you want to have this house.
[185:28.14]You could put... Because there's nothing in there right now.
[185:30.04]Yeah.
[185:30.46]I mean, you could put...
[185:31.98]uh like it could be like a den down here there could be a place like yeah yeah I feel like uh yeah it's a fixer-upper down there but I feel like this reminds me of the movie room yeah that's what it reminds me of with the brie larson but I but I really feel like it's that's the sauna connected to the kitchen um I think the design especially the exterior the blue I think speaks a lot to one of my favorite series and it might be yours too it's not the hedgehog
[185:57.91]Oh, I love Sonic.
[185:58.87]Yeah, one of my favorites.
[185:59.79]Alright, time's up, time's up, time's up, time's up.
[186:01.39]Brown-nosing over, brown-nosing over.
[186:02.49]Tails is cool, too, isn't it?
[186:03.39]Because this color is Tails.
[186:04.99]It's like... He's right.
[186:07.63]I had pink, which was like... You said it was like Dragon Ball.
[186:11.75]No, it was like Sonic's balls, which are very... They're not pink.
[186:16.65]They're not pink.
[186:17.25]That's not even correct.
[186:19.27]A new picture of him.
[186:21.45]There's a lot of pictures.
[186:22.27]I'm sure you can find many different colors.
[186:24.48]Amy?
[186:24.74]Amy?
[186:26.46]Why is everybody spamming Smite Sunday to me right now?
[186:30.48]So, Connor, with all that information, where's your head at?
[186:36.26]What are you thinking?
[186:37.86]Talk to us.
[186:39.12]Do I need to give, like, a number score for each or just say, like, which one is better?
[186:42.83]You could, yeah, give a number score.
[186:46.41]Starting with me, if you could.
[186:50.83]What I like about yours, Ludwig, was, you know, the...
[186:56.16]It had heart, you know?
[186:57.46]You obviously had a vision when you went into it.
[187:03.72]I like how a third of the space was a bathroom, or two bathrooms.
[187:08.69]His and hers, you know?
[187:10.47]Exactly.
[187:10.93]People get so caught up on his story.
[187:13.43]But Jerma has a his and hers shower, which I thought was kind of a neat addition.
[187:17.79]You said that, not him.
[187:19.19]I just want to cut inside and cut you off.
[187:21.68]He never said those words.
[187:22.88]Let's be very, very clear.
[187:24.16]This is a shower.
[187:26.06]You can enter from two different spots.
[187:28.02]You can enter from two different spots.
[187:29.56]It just makes it a hazard.
[187:33.63]I want to be clear about that.
[187:34.91]That glass door opening into a wall is a threat.
[187:38.45]It's a liability.
[187:40.53]Alright.
[187:41.20]But yeah, I see where your head's at.
[187:43.32]Yeah I like um, I liked your basement Ludwig. Because I - you know, I'm a streamer and I like how uh it kind of thought of that you know because like if I'm going to live in one of these I'd probably need that that space. Um.
[187:54.32]Yeah, as a streamer I always feel like I want a ready to go house-
[187:54.32]Yeah but don't you want to do- don't you want to decorate your own your space?
[188:00.32]Yeah it's see- and that's that's what I like about Jerma's though. Jerma not only does he have a bedroom downstairs with a smart TV, but he also thought of like you know preventative measures with the smart TV with the sauna.
[188:10.97]And you can say, like, you know, the sauna's unnecessary because it's, like, they're on the beach, but...
[188:16.76]It's- at the same time though, sometimes you don't want to be in the sun and you want to like-
[188:20.76]Feel the heat?
[188:21.76]You want to, maybe- I don't want to go outside all the time.
[188:24.00]Right but so it's like I'm in the sun I don't want to-
[188:29.00]Sauna kind of doesn't make any sense in like a summer beach house does it? Not really.
[188:35.00]But you know it's kind of like a status symbol though it's like: yeah I'm rich enough to have a sauna while I live on the beach.
[188:41.00]Connected to your kitchen by the way.
[188:44.00]It is connected to the kitchen, it's very accessible.
[188:46.70]Although, this kind of... I'm not going to tell you anything bad about my house.
[188:50.68]It's a great house.
[188:52.24]So, Connor, what would you give my score, final score, keeping the stream room in consideration, also the protection?
[188:58.60]It's hard for me to give a number score, but this guy just spoke for the first time I chatted.
[189:02.60]His name is MinecraftQuickscoper2007, and I'm going to have him pick.
[189:06.94]I'm going to have him give you a number.
[189:09.92]MinecraftQuickscoper, what do you think, man?
[189:12.02]Is he going to do Chermas 2, or...?
[189:14.69]Yeah, I mean, maybe.
[189:15.79]Whatever he wants.
[189:17.57]That's weird.
[189:18.15]Okay, he gave you a five, Ludwig.
[189:19.49]You got a five.
[189:20.17]Out of five?
[189:20.95]Five or out of ten?
[189:22.55]Did he clarify?
[189:23.35]I don't know.
[189:23.85]He just said five.
[189:27.04]Well, okay.
[189:28.64]He said Jerma's an eight.
[189:31.42]Excuse me.
[189:32.82]Thank you.
[189:34.48]What about you, Connor?
[189:35.52]How much watch time does he have on both of our channels?
[189:38.91]His account was made today.
[189:43.34]This could be like a banned account for me that's, you know, making their way over to you.
[189:48.60]I think it's a pretty accurate, like, score, though.
[189:50.86]It's a banned account on your channel.
[189:53.24]Uh-huh.
[189:54.22]Uh-huh.
[189:54.46]Could be, you know.
[189:55.66]So, alright.
[189:56.82]So, you give me a five.
[189:58.50]Jerma gets a point.
[190:00.37]I will say eight is a little generous for Jerma, only because...
[190:04.61]You did point out the fact that the shower does go into the wall, which kind of goes against the whole his and hers idea of the bathroom, because then it's tough to enter.
[190:13.23]So I will say Jerma was a bit more of like a seven instead of an eight.
[190:17.41]I also like Jerma's better because I don't like Dragon Ball.
[190:23.98]I don't watch anime.
[190:24.74]The only anime I watch is Pokémon.
[190:26.44]such a deep deep deep insight I told you I told everybody in my chat that's why you clean up the dragon balls you don't know what series they don't know exactly exactly and ledwig knows that too which is why I was a little surprised by that like I can't wait to collect them all and pray for you to leave this I would rather collect all the Pokémon is what I would do rather than dragon balls
[190:46.63]He literally just has a big old bag of Dragon Balls that he just brought outside of his house.
[190:50.63]He only has three of them, though.
[190:51.59]You had, like, a lot of them.
[190:53.73]Oh, it's a fucking cat toy.
[190:54.89]What are you talking about?
[190:55.77]He also just brought it back.
[190:57.03]Oh, I have a cat.
[190:59.40]Yeah, you put, like, you put, like, a little, uh, it spins around, like, the mice kind of move around.
[191:03.54]It's a cat toy.
[191:04.38]Okay, yeah, Jerma got a 7.5.
[191:05.72]Alright, Connor, feels like you made your mind up.
[191:07.54]Feels like you made your mind up.
[191:08.50]Feels like Jerma won that.
[191:09.28]Thank you so much, Connor.
[191:10.11]Really, really great insight there.
[191:11.27]Really great insight.
[191:11.75]No problem, guys.
[191:12.49]Yeah, no problem.
[191:13.31]No problem.
[191:13.93]What are you up to later today?
[191:15.41]Um...
[191:16.90]Oh, you booted him.
[191:17.80]Oh, that was me?
[191:18.24]Piece of shit.
[191:19.32]Absolute piece of shit.
[191:21.06]His and hers.
[191:22.18]His and hers.
[191:23.00]From the get-go, he was on your side, Jerma.
[191:25.44]Well, to be fair, we've got to be fair.
[191:28.02]We can critique each other's work at this point.
[191:30.65]I mean, half your house is a bathroom.
[191:33.35]I couldn't have a better basement.
[191:35.49]I could not have a better basement.
[191:36.87]I mean, and there are weapons pointing in every direction to people.
[191:40.01]Why are you saying it like it's a bad thing?
[191:42.15]I just don't think I would want to have a weapon, like a turret in the house.
[191:46.62]Okay, I disagree.
[191:48.66]I bought it because I was scared the liberals would take it away, so I stocked up early and often.
[191:54.82]Okay?
[191:56.48]But, you know, to each their own, I guess.
[191:59.95]Okay, your bedroom was... I thought I lost on your bedroom alone.
[192:04.63]I just should have started dreamer bedroom was like oh no it was like beautiful you had the big accent wall with the lights I was like this is bad I had a beautiful beautiful Persian rug but you know admittedly my upstairs could you I I I do like how you terraformed your house yeah I I exterior was important to me uh interior too because you added the whole wall right across you made it two rooms
[192:30.68]And I had the sauna, you know, that was, that was the sauna.
[192:33.14]You probably spent a little too much time on that.
[192:34.92]I won't, I won't lie to you.
[192:36.00]That was, yeah.
[192:38.95]Well, Jerma, that does make it three, three now.
[192:41.07]Okay.
[192:43.35]Three, two, three, which makes it my turn.
[192:47.65]It does.
[192:48.07]Uh, which means I get to pick the game.
[192:50.77]What games do I even have left?
[192:52.43]So where are we going?
[192:54.55]What games do I even have left?
[192:59.42]Let me just take a little squeak over here.
[193:01.59]Take a look.
[193:04.69]Ah!
[193:06.75]Of course.
[193:07.83]I don't like that.
[193:08.33]I don't like that realization that you found something good.
[193:13.63]Yeah, I'm just going to send you a link.
[193:16.04]A link?
[193:17.10]I don't even get to know what it is?
[193:18.24]No, you'll see.
[193:19.54]You'll see.
[193:20.86]You'll see the link, and you'll get to play.
[193:23.40]Don't leak the link, if you could.
[193:25.12]I will not leak the link.
[193:36.39]Okay.
[193:36.79]What's wrong?
[193:40.81]How much experience do you have with this?
[193:42.87]With this game?
[193:44.55]With this game in particular.
[193:46.33]A mild amount of experience.
[193:47.81]A mild amount of experience.
[193:49.09]Occasionally, I have booted up a game once.
[193:53.99]Oh, God damn it, dude.
[193:56.65]A year.
[193:57.95]Okay, how do I make a name?
[194:01.03]Click on a seat and then just type your name in.
[194:06.21]What about intended stack?
[194:08.92]Let's just put 1,000.
[194:09.68]Okay.
[194:12.46]He's making me play poker.
[194:14.26]It's heads up poker.
[194:16.34]That's right.
[194:17.40]That is right.
[194:18.44]I need the owner to approve of this.
[194:20.60]Approved.
[194:22.27]Okay.
[194:22.61]Approved.
[194:24.01]Hold on.
[194:24.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[194:25.19]I don't, I don't.
[194:26.19]There's no timer.
[194:26.79]There's no timer.
[194:27.55]I don't know.
[194:28.75]Okay.
[194:28.95]No, there's no timer.
[194:30.23]Alright.
[194:30.83]There's no timer.
[194:31.81]You can take your sweet.
[194:32.53]Oh, well, there's a timer at the bottom of your screen.
[194:34.97]So yeah, but there's a timer, but-
[194:35.97]Is this like Texas hold em?
[194:36.97]What's beeping?
[194:37.95]Texas hold em, that's right. Oh, because there is a timer and you got a little bit time left.
[194:41.00]What?
[194:41.99]Well when I said there's no timer I meant that more like metaphorically.
[194:45.00]Okay, alright so why- I can see your hand though?
[194:48.00]I just showed it to you.
[194:49.00]What?
[194:50.00]So like for example: I can- I can raise right here I'll just- I'll do a slight raise we have a thousand chips total whoever has all the chips at the end wins and that that could happen-
[194:56.00]But like the river comes out! Is it Texas hold em?
[194:59.60]Yeah it's Texas hold em, so the flop will come out but you have to call - there's the flop.
[195:05.30]You know? And then it's the action to you and then you can check you can raise.
[195:09.30]Alright, let's go ahead and bet.
[195:10.30]Hey I'll call it. I'll call it and then... there's an ace action to you again.
[195:15.30]So, what? You just keep betting, right?
[195:18.30]Yeah you just keep betting and whoever gets all the- and then like you bet like a little bit there and then maybe I'd- I'd be like- I'd be like, you know, what's 50 more? You know what I mean? Just small - it's a nominal amount, it's a nominal amount.
[195:33.23]What does that mean? oh Jerma you absolute idiot am I stupid because I just won the game that's a three of a kind you just got sharked I just shocked him I play poker all the time it's one of my favorite games
[195:34.23]Oh, Jerma - you absolute idiot.
[195:40.23]Am I stupid? Because I just won the game!
[195:49.23]That's a three of a kind. You just got sharked! I just shocked him! I play poker all the time, it's one of my favorite games.
[196:01.78]I play poker every day of my life.
[196:04.34]I play it more than Blackjack.
[196:05.40]I play it more than Elden Ring.
[196:08.86]It's a shark.
[196:09.80]You flopped a set?
[196:12.44]You flopped a set?
[196:15.55]I thought he was being stupid.
[196:16.95]I thought he was being, I don't know what I'm doing.
[196:19.57]I thought he was actually stupid.
[196:21.55]I'm still in it.
[196:22.17]I'm still in it.
[196:22.95]I'm still in it.
[196:23.41]What are we playing to?
[196:24.73]I'm still, it's whoever gets the most chips.
[196:25.95]Do you have to get all my chips?
[196:29.04]It's whoever gets all the chips.
[196:30.40]I still had 50.
[196:30.88]How many chips do you have?
[196:33.96]I had 75.
[196:34.98]Oh, bro.
[196:35.72]I'm taking them all.
[196:38.10]Chip in a chair.
[196:38.90]Let's go.
[196:39.54]King.

[196:48.92]Yes.
[196:52.08]Give me a nine.
[196:52.48]Give me a nine.
[196:53.96]Oh.
[196:54.42]That's alright.
[196:54.96]It's alright.

[197:12.13]Come on!
[197:13.57]Let's just... How about we just go all in?
[197:15.59]You're going all in with 150 chips.
[197:18.25]You're sitting next to a billionaire right now.
[197:21.47]I'm gone.
[197:21.91]It doesn't matter to me.
[197:24.95]Just trying to bluff him.
[197:25.93]I'm taking all these chips right now.
[197:27.93]No, no, no.
[197:28.23]I can win.
[197:28.55]I can win.
[197:28.91]Nine.
[197:29.57]Nine.
[197:29.73]It's a nine.

[198:24.87]Like I thought I had a I knew what was happening there.
[198:29.49]I hate you.
[198:31.63]You had a choice.
[198:33.81]Oh, yeah.
[198:34.01]What were the choices?
[198:35.21]You could have folded.
[198:37.96]You son of a bitch.
[198:40.68]You son of a bitch.
[198:42.80]So what's the what's the score right now?
[198:44.30]Four to three?
[198:44.92]Four to three.
[198:45.92]It's game point for you.
[198:47.25]So how many games we have left?
[198:49.95]Well, if you win this, it's over.
[198:51.85]The only games left are the neutral games.
[198:54.52]Oh, shit.
[198:54.82]What are the neutral games that we have if this keeps going?
[198:57.02]Connect 4, Rock, Paper, Scissors, and you get to pick between Rock, Paper, Scissors and React Time if I win this.
[199:01.90]Oh, dude.
[199:02.76]This might come down to Rock, Paper, Scissors.
[199:04.66]What a fucking disaster.
[199:06.44]Okay.
[199:06.94]Alright.
[199:07.36]Here you go.
[199:07.94]Here you go, Jerma.

[199:13.56]This is Best of 5?
[199:16.54]Yeah.
[199:18.18]I'm assuming I don't want to show this.
[199:19.52]Not playing Toontown, Chad.
[199:20.77]I'm not playing Toontown.
[199:21.97]I'm assuming I don't want to show this, right?
[199:24.69]I would not show this.
[199:25.43]Yeah, I would keep this private.
[199:27.41]I can show this.
[199:29.33]Yeah.
[199:30.15]Timers on the screen.
[199:30.85]It's your move.
[199:32.03]Of course it goes first.
[199:47.47]I haven't played Connect Four since I was probably four.
[199:49.49]That's got to be a joke.
[200:12.68]It wasn't.
[200:14.44]It wasn't?
[200:15.04]What is this?
[200:33.17]What are these moves?
[200:34.03]Guys, I don't know.
[200:34.61]I don't play Connect Four.
[200:35.69]I know you just get four in a row.
[200:37.33]I don't know.
[200:39.45]I panicked.
[200:39.89]I panicked.
[200:44.89]Ah!
[200:45.54]Whatever.
[200:45.96]Fuck.
[200:46.30]Who cares?
[200:46.90]Yeah!
[200:47.46]Alright, fuck.
[200:48.92]Who cares?
[200:49.28]That's one.
[200:49.64]That's a five.
[200:50.24]That's a five.
[200:50.66]That's a lot of game.
[200:51.70]It's a lot.
[200:52.22]Just rematch?
[200:53.38]Yeah, rematch.
[200:53.86]Rematch.
[200:56.10]He starts again, of course.
[200:56.98]He starts again.
[201:08.90]Mmm, a mirror match.
[202:42.84]Time's up.
[202:57.87]Fuck.
[202:58.37]I don't know.
[202:58.85]I don't know.
[203:00.79]I don't know.
[203:01.25]I actually don't know.
[203:02.01]I'm scared.
[203:02.41]Got to make a call.
[203:03.14]Got to make a play.
[203:04.80]That's not it.
[203:25.79]Alright, Jerma.
[203:26.81]Yeah.
[203:29.07]One game away from this being a game nine situation.
[203:35.12]Oh, fuck.
[203:35.70]I'm not good at this.
[203:38.44]I'm not good at this.
[203:39.50]You ought to make it a major comeback.
[203:41.22]Yeah, I'm not good at this.
[203:42.20]I'm not very good at this thing.
[203:43.72]This game.
[203:46.28]I'm starting first here.
[203:59.94]You have no Connect Force skills?
[204:01.27]I know.
[204:02.01]I don't know what I'm doing.
[204:02.87]I just know that there's two colors on the screen and I have to... I don't know how this works.
[204:07.89]I mean, I do, but... Let's throw a wild card in here.
[204:26.38]Oh, you're trying to do this, like, diagonal shit.
[204:31.12]I'm just mulling over options.
[204:32.64]I got nothing right now.
[204:33.52]It's quite shut down.
[204:34.56]Uh-oh.
[205:16.64]Ah!
[205:22.36]Oh, fuck.
[205:22.80]I lose.
[205:27.97]It's over.
[205:33.79]Okay.
[205:34.09]Connect four is too...
[205:40.18]Tech 4 is like tic-tac-toe.
[205:41.74]It's like one way to make sure you win every game.
[205:44.19]And that's it.
[205:45.63]I didn't throw.
[205:46.63]I promise I didn't throw.
[205:48.93]Alright.
[205:49.85]How are we going to do this?
[205:52.87]Rock, paper, scissors?
[205:54.54]Oh my god.
[205:55.46]I can't believe this is going to end with rock, paper, scissors.
[205:58.18]We're just going to have to go full cam for this then, huh?
[206:04.40]We can do full cam.
[206:05.04]There's also a pretty good website for it.
[206:08.77]How do you want to do it?
[206:09.99]I'll link it to you.
[206:10.55]You take a look at that.
[206:11.37]Okay.
[206:18.69]Wait, no.
[206:18.97]I sent you a bad link.
[206:19.85]This link.
[206:20.69]Sorry.
[206:20.85]Alright.
[206:24.73]You want to do it through the website?
[206:26.62]I think it's pretty hard if you do it with the delay.
[206:29.88]I've tried it before.
[206:30.44]Yeah, that's true.
[206:32.37]That's absolutely true.
[206:33.43]Exciting as the throw the fist, but it's best of five, just so you see.
[206:39.15]It's best of five.
[206:41.25]Yeah.
[206:42.33]Am I good to show this?
[206:43.99]I have a question for you.
[206:45.43]Yeah, you can show everything.
[206:47.89]Before we jump in, do you happen to watch anime?
[206:53.14]I'm not going to answer any of your questions because I feel like if I give you an anime, it's going to be tied to one of these items.
[206:58.14]That would be, it's a. Like if I'm like, well, why would you, that's a weird paper.
[207:01.98]Cause it's written down.
[207:02.88]It's scissors.
[207:03.72]Cause they, they edit it and cut it up.
[207:05.36]It's a rock because you got to have a skull of a rock to do it.
[207:09.29]I come on.
[207:10.21]I don't know.
[207:10.55]I feel like that, that question, I'm going to say like full metal alchemist and you're gonna be like scissors and you're going to get it.
[207:14.45]So I'm not gonna say anything.
[207:17.49]Weird that you would name an anime though.
[207:20.23]Attack on Titan.
[207:21.07]Full Metal Alchemist.
[207:22.45]Cowboy Bebop.
[207:22.97]There you go.
[207:24.43]There's the rock, paper, scissors.
[207:25.20]Now you don't know.
[207:25.98]You have no idea which one I'm going to do.
[207:32.46]Okay.
[207:32.74]I've got a question for you then.
[207:34.14]Yeah, please.
[207:34.52]What's your favorite vegetable?
[207:37.94]Carrot.
[207:38.34]Okay.
[207:41.82]Is it really?
[207:43.50]Are you sure it's carrot?
[207:46.41]I like carrot.
[207:49.92]Hmm.
[207:51.68]That means... Okay.
[207:55.82]He must be a fan of orange.
[207:56.84]I knew it!
[207:58.56]I knew it!
[208:01.68]Wait, why would I pick that?
[208:02.77]That was your thing!
[208:03.75]Oh my god, anime.
[208:07.23]Everyone who watches anime picks scissors first.
[208:12.03]It was subconscious.
[208:15.75]Ask me a question.
[208:19.53]Okay.
[208:22.63]Would you consider yourself solid like a stone?
[208:27.46]Are you somebody that can be relied on?
[208:32.06]Are you constantly, constantly cutting things out of your life and trying to drop stuff from your life?
[208:39.15]Or are you the type of person that would want to get under the covers and get covered?
[208:49.52]I feel like, I'll say this honestly, I feel like I'm more go with the wind.
[208:54.17]Are you?
[208:55.21]Yeah, I go with the wind.
[208:56.59]Mm-hmm.
[208:59.47]Got him.
[209:00.89]How did you know?
[209:01.51]I thought you would think on paper.
[209:03.27]Exactly.
[209:04.57]Oh, fuck.
[209:05.85]Got him.
[209:06.11]Because rocks go with the wind.
[209:07.55]They do.
[209:09.29]Fuck.
[209:10.03]Go to paper.
[209:12.63]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[209:14.05]Mm-hmm.
[209:20.39]If... You already selected.
[209:23.78]You selected rock.
[209:24.70]You hesitated.
[209:26.32]You hesitated, which meant you're going to pick paper because that's the safest choice.
[209:28.98]It's right in the middle.
[209:32.32]I made a decision.
[209:33.16]You did.
[209:35.00]Yes!
[209:35.50]Fuck.
[209:36.41]Okay.
[209:52.12]Give me just one moment.
[210:14.10]It's not happening.
[210:16.11]What's not happening?
[210:18.39]I had a plan.
[210:19.67]I had a whole plan.
[210:20.55]It failed.
[210:22.74]I had a whole plan, it failed!
[210:24.60]What was the plan?
[210:26.18]My music's been buffering all day, so I was gonna count until it buffered, but then the music didn't buffer this time, so I've just been counting.
[210:34.01]Rock.
[210:35.05]FUCK!
[210:43.55]Oh, that was stressful!
[210:46.80]That was stressful.
[210:51.39]It was my tried and true.
[210:52.75]You always go back to your tried and trues.
[210:55.63]It hadn't been picked in a while.
[210:56.97]Rock had not been picked in a while.
[210:58.67]You knew that.
[211:00.23]I thought you were going to go scissors initially.
[211:02.09]That's why I was like, wait.
[211:02.93]But that's why you going scissors was like, wait a minute.
[211:05.76]He's going to know that I think he's going scissors.
[211:09.36]You booed me.
[211:10.14]You booed me today, Jerma.
[211:12.92]That's alright.
[211:13.84]I still owe you $1,500 at the roulette table.
[211:15.78]Yeah, I'll still go to Vegas and give you a costume and...
[211:20.32]Actually, a lot of things.
[211:21.22]Look at a bucket list of things to do.
[211:22.60]Enjoy Toontown.
[211:23.86]I heard it's pretty good.
[211:25.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[211:26.12]I'm looking forward to it.
[211:28.82]Oh, that was fun.
[211:30.06]That was a blast.
[211:30.88]That was a good time.
[211:32.60]Thank you very much, Jerma, for gaming.
[211:35.13]Absolutely.
[211:35.61]Anytime, man.
[211:36.81]You know, I've lost almost every single one of these.
[211:38.85]Have you really?
[211:41.37]Almost exclusively lost these.
[211:43.79]It must be cursed.
[211:46.27]I think I'm just a bad gamer is what it turns out to be.
[211:49.76]That was close.
[211:50.72]That was really close.
[211:52.92]If I was 30 seconds factor on PyCross, I'm going to play that game on the plane.
[211:58.75]Yeah, the PyCross, I think, is what really did you in.
[212:04.01]Alright, brother.
[212:05.31]Yeah, thanks a lot.
[212:06.25]Have fun with whatever you're doing next.
[212:08.15]I got a jet.
[212:08.69]I got a jet.
[212:09.33]Are you staying live for a bit?
[212:10.76]I'll be live, yeah.
[212:11.30]I'll be live for like an hour.
[212:12.10]Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[212:12.60]Alright, well, have a good one, brother.
[212:14.32]Have a good stream.
[212:14.86]Yeah, thanks a lot.
[212:15.34]It was fun.
[212:16.00]Peace.
[212:18.53]That was a lot of fun.
[212:20.24]That was awesome.
[212:21.68]I actually won one of these.
[212:23.32]I never win one of these.
[212:26.62]He has a jet.
[212:31.36]I've never won these.
[212:32.73]I don't ever win.
[212:33.93]I thought he was going to get me in the end here.
[212:37.85]That was fun.
[212:38.81]Alright, I'm going to take a quick break.
[212:41.19]I'm going to refill my drink and I'm going to jump into Elden Ring for a few hours.
[212:45.94]I'll see you guys in... Oh, the poker shit.
[212:48.50]Yeah.
[212:49.20]Oh, man.
[212:49.82]That was bad.
[212:53.60]Oh, he got so screwed there.
[212:57.80]I can't believe you did it.
[212:59.28]I can't believe you did that.
[213:00.16]Alright.
[213:03.77]I'll be back in like two, three minutes.
[213:05.03]I'm going to go pee and get a drink.
[213:07.09]I'll see you guys in a minute.
