[07:08.74]I'd rebuild his house if I had the funds.
[07:10.88]Donate 999 GP.
[07:14.68]I don't have that.
[07:18.38]Once united, the four sacred children of Gerudo have the power of summoning the forces of nature.
[07:24.28]They could help us if we could find them.
[07:26.10]Alright.
[07:26.64]This is fucking PogChamp if I've ever seen one.
[07:31.48]So you have to, like, rebuild shit?
[07:32.78]Alright, let's go.
[07:36.14]I can't do any business without a nice shop.
[07:38.04]What shall I do?
[07:39.22]Donate 700... I don't have that.
[07:40.52]Alright, let's... This is all upgradable.

[07:46.29]It's already got me.
[07:47.37]Alright.
[07:48.81]Those little cows are so cute.
[07:49.95]It would be a shame if they got lost and hurt themselves.

[07:55.69]Again, 100 GP.
[07:58.35]Please accept this reward as a token of my gratitude.

[08:10.15]Donate 350... Alright, I need to get GP.
[08:13.82]Time to unbox.
[08:18.12]Without a watermill, we can't produce flour.
[08:20.28]People are starving.
[08:21.50]Uh, look, I can only do one thing at a time here.
[08:25.65]Alright, let's... Alright, how do I leave?
[08:33.53]Do I just leave?
[08:37.74]Oh, shit.
[08:38.20]Alright.
[08:40.16]Clover Village.
[08:45.30]Oh, alright.
[08:45.82]Let's do it.
[08:46.26]This is it.
[08:46.86]This is where we get money.
[08:47.66]I don't have any fire left.
[08:59.39]Alright.
[09:00.05]What am I doing?
[09:00.49]Okay.
[09:01.29]My brain is freaking out.
[09:02.54]It's just mouse.
[09:03.06]It's just the mouse.
[09:05.94]I'm doing like W-A-S-D.
[09:09.41]You can move it with WASD.
[09:10.95]Okay, I got fireballs now.
[09:11.89]Can I break them?
[09:12.77]You can break them with a fireball.
[09:13.96]Holy shit.
[09:15.00]Alright, this is overwhelming me.
[09:16.18]This is fun.
[09:17.66]I actually like this.
[09:23.28]Yep.
[09:23.76]Alright, it's not hard.
[09:24.52]Fuck!
[09:24.82]It's not hard.
[09:25.26]Alright, alright.
[09:25.86]It's fun.
[09:26.24]It's fun.
[09:26.50]It's fun.
[09:26.80]Continue.
[09:27.10]Continue.
[09:27.36]I only have three continues.
[09:28.66]What?
[09:30.47]No, reach, reach.
[09:31.45]Oh, okay.
[09:32.03]Hold on.
[09:32.35]Hold on.
[09:34.07]Re, um, reach.
[09:36.57]Do I only have three continues ever?
[09:44.64]Alright, don't mess with me.
[09:45.52]Oh my god.
[09:46.38]Why am I so... I'm overexcited and shit.
[09:48.72]Like, what's wrong with me?
[09:50.08]I'm freaking out.
[09:50.90]Alright, got the bad guy.
[09:56.45]Am I getting GP?
[10:00.17]Holy fuck, that was close.
[10:20.31]I can break the last two over here.
[10:25.77]It's got... The ball moves really fast.
[10:29.41]Got it.
[10:29.83]Alright.
[10:34.66]Oops.
[10:36.06]So Red Ruby's 10 GP.
[10:37.54]Cool.
[10:40.93]That's level 1.
[10:46.49]Alright.
[10:47.37]I gotta get it up in the top so it bounces on top of everything.
[10:50.15]Here we go.
[10:50.51]Ready?
[10:51.81]First try.
[10:52.27]Get it.
[10:53.20]Thank you.
[10:57.66]And I can't shoot these, so I have to... It has to go up there.
[11:01.12]What is K?
[11:02.84]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[11:03.52]What did I just do?
[11:04.40]Alright, well, K does what?
[11:07.36]Oh, it's wind.
[11:09.02]It's the right mount.
[11:10.74]I'm not sure what it does.
[11:17.42]I just fucking blew that.
[11:18.40]Alright, let's go.
[11:22.54]Altar?
[11:26.54]So you can blow it the other direction?
[11:28.56]Huh.
[11:35.70]I see.
[11:36.20]Alright.
[11:36.59]Well, that was easy.
[11:41.37]It's pushing me towards the paddle.
[11:42.67]Is that what's going on?
[11:46.72]Yeah, but this shit's on hard.
[11:48.30]Okay, level... Let's go... Where should I go?
[11:54.44]I'm gonna try to go... I'm gonna try to get stuck in the top right.
[11:57.44]Fucked it up.
[11:58.02]Sorry.
[11:58.72]Open the crates.
[12:06.61]Stay on that right.
[12:07.31]Stay on that left side.
[12:12.45]Yeah!
[12:12.75]Yeah!
[12:15.99]When did this game come out?
[12:17.01]Why did I not know this game existed?
[12:28.24]Came out in 1980?
[12:28.94]No, it's not.
[12:34.03]It's got great sounds, too.
[12:44.35]I have enough to do, what, the lumber mill?
[12:46.25]Whatever it is.
[12:46.65]Maybe I'll do that.
[12:54.74]Get on there.
[13:05.40]The farmer?
[13:06.44]Yeah, yeah, we'll pick one.
[13:07.86]2011 was almost 10 years ago.
[13:12.42]I know, it's ridiculous.
[13:17.96]I'm making a lot of money, though.
[13:21.56]Jerma, this is a fun minigame.
[13:22.56]Can you please go back to solving the main mystery in Nancy Drew?
[13:26.44]Nah.
[13:27.60]Nah, I'm good for now.
[13:28.52]I only have two more continues, though.
[13:35.71]I'm kind of concerned about that.
[13:36.87]Did I blow the whole thing?
[13:37.97]Do I only get three continues in the whole game?
[13:45.65]I wasted all my ammo.
[13:46.95]Can I sneak it up the side?
[13:49.73]Oh, yeah.
[13:52.67]Yep.
[13:54.57]Oh, this is nice.
[13:55.83]I like this.
[13:56.33]This is relaxing to me.
[14:04.44]Shit, I missed the coin.
[14:08.74]Whoa.
[14:11.10]What just happened?
[14:12.40]It's like pinball?
[14:15.28]Alright, pop it!
[14:15.84]Pop it all!
[14:18.14]Do I have any time?
[14:21.56]Or is it just whenever I fall?
[14:28.73]Oh, this is cool.
[14:32.11]There's like 20 plus hours of Nance Drew on YouTube now?
[14:34.43]What do you mean?
[14:36.43]20 plus hours?
[14:38.65]You're talking about from this channel?
[14:44.84]I mean, yeah.
[14:46.36]We played three of the games and beaten two of them.
[14:52.97]I have to be careful, though.
[14:54.93]Because... If you... There are some Twitch metrics that you can look at.
[15:01.83]And you can see, you can analyze your stream, you can analyze data and all this shit, right?
[15:06.67]Once you... I don't want to cross the threshold when Nancy Drew...
[15:12.15]is in, like, the top five of most time on stream.
[15:20.67]I have to be careful with that.
[15:24.73]Because, oh, Nancy Drew, 20 hours.
[15:26.45]Nancy Drew, like, Nancy Drew, 40 hours.
[15:28.35]Nancy Drew, like, 180 hours of Nancy Drew.
[15:31.57]That trumps every single game I've ever played.
[15:36.07]Oh, shit.
[15:36.73]I can press a button and go in?
[15:37.77]I didn't know that.
[15:44.57]I'm going to use the fireball here.
[15:46.13]Right at the front.
[15:48.45]Get in there.
[15:49.63]Give me the bonus.
[15:51.71]Bonus.
[15:52.11]Give it to me.
[15:55.07]No.
[15:55.77]No.
[15:56.81]Get in there.
[15:57.28]Does it close?
[15:58.80]Get in.
[16:05.74]Get in.
[16:07.48]Get in.
[16:07.88]No.
[16:08.16]Yes.
[16:08.32]Uh...
[16:17.36]What is this for?
[16:18.49]75... Is this a magnet?
[16:26.41]Let's the orb stick to the magic wand when they collide.
[16:29.29]Oh, that's pretty good.
[16:30.01]I don't know.
[16:34.86]For 75, though, I don't know about that.
[16:36.10]This is just another live?
[16:44.34]I think I'm gonna get... Yeah, replenish his magic.
[16:45.84]I'm gonna get this.
[16:48.14]Yeah, that feels... Look at my bar.
[16:49.26]Alright, cool.
[16:49.70]Alright, I'm gonna save the rest.
[16:52.10]What is this?
[16:56.14]I don't get it.
[16:57.76]What did I just do?
[16:59.70]Is that a curse?
[17:00.92]Oh no, oh no, oh no.
[17:03.46]What?
[17:03.94]What's wrong?
[17:18.31]What?
[17:19.39]What happened?
[17:23.27]Are there bosses in this game?
[17:33.42]Yeah?
[17:35.22]He doesn't know.
[17:35.84]What happened?
[17:40.40]Oh, I had 666 coins.
[17:43.20]Now I see your concern.
[17:44.52]It's okay, I'm fine.
[17:50.46]I feel like I don't want to touch that in here.
[18:01.97]There are other spells available when the ball hits the paddle?
[18:05.17]Really?
[18:07.21]Oh, shit, there is.
[18:11.01]What does K do?
[18:15.85]Get in there.
[18:16.35]Get stuck up there.
[18:17.09]Come on.
[18:19.18]Get stuck up there.
[18:20.00]Get in the middle and bounce around all over the place.
[18:24.89]Oh, shit, there is.
[18:28.25]Oh, it turns into fire?
[18:29.57]I don't have enough to do it.
[18:32.72]What is... I don't understand.
[18:37.30]That's all my magic is gone.
[18:40.70]I don't know what that did.
[18:51.68]Open the chest, I'll get him.
[18:56.37]Ooh, that was close.
[18:59.87]The fairy lets you control the ball.
[19:02.05]Ah.
[19:04.67]Very cool.
[19:10.10]Streamer plays mobile game for 6k viewers.
[19:12.64]This game ain't even on mobile.
[19:14.50]What are you on about?
[19:15.22]You can't even get this on mobile.
[19:27.12]You should be able to.
[19:28.20]I feel like it'd be hard on mobile.
[19:30.14]You have to have your finger on the screen just drag back and forth like crazy.
[19:33.10]I mean, maybe it would not be hard.
[19:41.86]A lot of money.
[19:42.48]That was awesome.
[19:46.52]How is that hard?
[19:47.24]It just, it is.
[19:48.10]Your finger gets like greasy and shit and it can't register.
[19:52.25]By the way, I think this game is like $2.
[19:54.65]I'm not kidding.
[19:55.25]This game is like $2 or $3.
[19:57.11]Tops.
[20:04.36]Fuck.
[20:04.92]I blew it.
[20:06.08]Now I can still save it.
[20:07.10]Just get up there.
[20:09.10]Get in there.
[20:09.64]Come on.
[20:10.07]I can still do it.
[20:11.11]Yes.
[20:11.97]No.
[20:12.13]No.
[20:19.23]Get up there.
[20:20.75]Don't break this.
[20:21.47]Whatever.
[20:23.61]It's over.
[20:26.19]Okay, that's amazing.
[20:28.07]I just was shocked.
[20:31.39]That's awesome.
[20:33.79]It goes through everything?
[20:35.94]Save up for that one.
[20:39.08]It's literally three dollars.
[20:40.48]Yeah, this game is three dollars.
[20:54.96]I think I'm playing pretty well.
[20:56.04]Ooh, that was close.
[21:03.57]Alright, I'm just going to get it.
[21:08.63]Kill the two bears.
[21:15.92]There it is.
[21:17.62]What's left?
[21:18.02]What is left?
[21:22.62]Oh, the top left corner is shit.
[21:24.96]Alright, let me just... Box top left.
[21:29.40]I got it.
[21:34.08]Four dollars.
[21:34.85]Wow, this game must be bad.
[21:40.01]Four dollars must be awful then.
[21:49.03]No, if a game, it might be fun.
[21:50.63]No, I want to... Not worth it.
[21:56.28]I'll buy this.
[22:02.22]Saving.
[22:08.28]You're a real stinker.
[22:09.31]What do you mean?
[22:15.65]I want the magnet.
[22:18.05]Well, I wanna fix the town up first.
[22:19.97]I don't wanna just go straight for the magnet.
[22:25.10]I think that's using keys.
[22:29.42]What about the left door?
[22:42.44]Get in that left door.
[22:46.44]Alright, I gotta feed it up there.
[22:48.44]Very gently.
[22:50.44]Yeah.
[22:52.08]Damn it.
[22:53.48]Jesus!
[22:57.21]Get up there!
[22:58.45]Yes.
[23:01.63]What about the button?
[23:04.95]I didn't get the button.
[23:05.91]I feel completely unsatisfied.
[23:07.85]Aww.
[23:17.15]I feel terrible right now.
[23:21.86]Alright, watch this.
[23:22.38]Oh, Jesus!
[23:30.16]Give me it!
[23:31.12]Yeah, that's pretty damn good.
[23:39.47]I don't want to get... Ah!
[23:41.19]I did... What?
[23:44.65]Teleport spell?
[23:50.40]I didn't want to get grabbed.
[23:51.40]I still don't know what the grab does.
[24:02.71]You're cheating?
[24:04.91]You lose money.
[24:05.73]Oh, that's terrible.
[24:07.07]How much do you lose?
[24:07.75]I feel like my paddle is smaller.
[24:12.60]Or am I making that up?
[24:25.23]Oh my god, I'm not making this up.
[24:29.97]It's alright, I got plenty of lives.
[24:34.59]You've always had a small paddle.
[24:39.56]I don't even know what you're referring to.
[24:47.72]Keep going.
[24:50.80]No, no, turn, turn!
[24:52.06]Yes!
[24:56.31]We can just watch the movie play out.
[25:03.63]Here it is.
[25:04.13]I don't even have to do shit.
[25:07.69]Telekinesis achievement.
[25:16.63]I want to see another Scare Saturday.
[25:20.45]Well, the scary games that I want to play has got to come out.
[25:24.53]This one's odd.
[25:25.47]Although I can go straight up.
[25:26.65]Do I have a key?
[25:27.35]I've got two keys.
[25:27.99]Oops.
[25:32.36]Get in.
[25:36.50]The same magnet.
[25:37.36]Should I just get it?
[25:40.08]I mean, it's just going to be here every time.
[25:43.27]I'm getting it.
[25:47.75]And I'm getting the heart.
[25:49.35]No, I'm not.
[25:50.75]Yeah, fuck it.
[25:52.77]Uh, I'll give you the magic.
[25:53.90]Yeah.
[25:54.06]Alright, I'm up.
[25:56.30]Should I get the heart, too?
[25:57.00]Alright, I got plenty of money.
[26:01.98]Wait, what?
[26:02.84]Adds one life?
[26:04.20]Oh, I can buy this as many times as I want.
[26:05.52]Alright, I'm doing five and I'm up.
[26:11.75]Alright, I gotta watch it.
[26:12.51]I'm gonna sneak it through right there.
[26:14.37]Oh.
[26:14.65]Wait, what?
[26:18.48]Does it keep the same trajectory?
[26:21.72]No, you can actually move it.
[26:22.90]That's great.
[26:25.12]Oh, maybe it does.
[26:28.64]That's not cheating.
[26:35.64]It's an item in the game.
[26:36.38]Sorry, I gotta use... I have so much magic.
[26:50.86]I couldn't get them both.
[26:52.04]You know I couldn't.
[26:54.24]Now you're on easy mode.
[26:55.86]Well, this is only level one.
[26:57.25]I have to assume it gets harder after this.
[27:12.64]Sure it does.
[27:13.18]Kappa.
[27:18.69]I actually don't like it.
[27:19.73]I'm trying to figure out how the trajectory works.
[27:30.12]So, I think it just keeps following the... No, it doesn't.
[27:32.84]I thought it kept following the path.
[27:40.53]It's based on where it is on the paddle.
[27:42.45]That makes sense.
[27:45.01]So I want to get it on the left side.
[27:46.99]Like this.
[27:48.29]And then, yeah.
[27:48.95]Alright, I feel you.
[27:49.83]I feel you.
[27:55.07]Come on, get over there.
[27:59.89]Nice.
[28:05.54]VIP this person?
[28:06.80]VIP who?
[28:08.88]Somebody here?
[28:12.13]I'm falling asleep here.
[28:13.15]That's alright.
[28:16.50]We're just chilling.
[28:19.30]I mean, we're just chilling right now.
[28:21.28]I'm relaxing.
[28:22.10]I'm just fucking chilling.
[28:24.76]Just lying back.
[28:27.52]Yeah, this is like pretty nice actually.
[28:29.82]This is pretty nice to me.
[28:35.60]Honestly, all I need right now is just a large pizza.
[28:39.73]That's my large pizza.
[28:43.79]After every level, I take just a huge bite of like this crispy pepperoni pizza.
[28:48.71]You know what I mean?
[28:55.97]I love pizza.
[28:58.81]I know when... Every time somebody... When you ask anyone what their favorite food is from the second to the eighth grade... Pizza!
[29:08.92]But I love pizza.
[29:10.10]That's seriously one of my favorite things on Earth.
[29:14.10]I would probably still have like the fourth grade answer.
[29:21.40]French fries.
[29:22.44]No.
[29:23.42]Pizza.
[29:30.25]People happy.
[29:31.31]Pizza.
[29:33.65]It's so good though.
[29:34.69]It really is.
[29:41.21]I could probably eat pizza every single day.
[29:45.92]You know, I could.
[29:58.75]That sounds bad.
[29:59.75]I'm just saying.
[30:01.13]I'm not gonna do it, but I probably could.
[30:03.23]I'm actually pretty easy to please when it comes to food.
[30:08.11]I really am.
[30:12.03]There are people that would say, like, man, I mean, I've eaten pizza, like, four times this week.
[30:15.87]Fuck that.
[30:16.47]I want something else.
[30:17.23]And I'm the guy that's like, yeah.
[30:19.67]Fuck that.
[30:22.07]I would eat it again, though.
[30:22.91]If you, like, wanted to get it, I would eat it.
[30:25.29]I would eat it every day.
[30:29.60]I'm pretty easy to please.
[30:35.36]Yeah, fuck that.
[30:36.64]I've had pizza, like, three times this week.
[30:38.58]Fuck, but, I mean, like, what else is open?
[30:42.04]I mean, it's like, we're not, we could go to, like, McDonald's, but that's, like, what else is open?
[30:46.36]We don't have fucking options besides maybe, like, pizza.
[30:52.01]That's true, though.
[30:52.61]It actually is.
[31:05.80]But Uber Eats is a thing now.
[31:10.66]Oh, hold on.
[31:11.48]We got a boss battle.
[31:13.14]Do I have a health bar?
[31:15.64]How does this work?
[31:19.01]Holy shit.
[31:20.93]Alright.
[31:23.41]Alright, I gotta get like the...
[31:34.33]I'm wasting these shots.
[31:36.41]Here we are.
[31:37.89]Alright.
[31:40.91]Giant wolf.
[31:49.32]Watch it.
[31:55.44]Yeah, there aren't many... There really aren't that many foods I could eat every day.
[31:59.95]What?
[32:00.47]Pizza?
[32:01.45]Uh-oh.
[32:09.72]Very small.
[32:12.12]Tiny.
[32:13.64]I got it.
[32:14.88]First boss.
[32:21.76]Seven lives, too.
[32:26.15]Am I going back to town?
[32:28.85]There's another slime fort.
[32:30.83]No, hold on.
[32:31.29]Let's go back to town.
[32:33.29]Kingdom of Gerudo.
[32:38.60]Alright, who do we, um... Who do we give money to?
[32:42.78]I have 1,400.
[32:44.70]I love my tavern.
[32:45.36]I'll be in ruin.
[32:46.02]I'll miss all the gossip going around.
[32:47.52]Donate.
[32:48.10]Yeah, let's get the tavern going.
[32:49.92]You just saved my business.
[32:50.92]Please accept this reward.
[32:52.84]You got an extra life.
[32:58.22]Alright, well, we're gonna get a tavern.
[33:00.05]Um... What is this?
[33:01.55]An enormous flying eye struck my house with a lightning bolt and burnt it to the ground.
[33:08.84]Yeah, alright, let's get your house built.
[33:12.20]Got a key.
[33:15.28]Woof, woof.
[33:16.04]Donate a house... to the dog?
[33:17.50]Barf.
[33:20.28]You got a key.
[33:20.86]Let's open up the shop.
[33:29.78]I need a nice shop.
[33:30.46]What should I do?
[33:31.60]Alright, I gotta do the shop.
[33:32.66]Yeah.
[33:34.52]750.
[33:35.87]Shop will be open after I do one more.
[33:39.50]Alright, I got three keys, eight lives.
[33:40.66]Let's go to the next area.
[33:47.73]Slime Forest.
[33:48.75]Level two, one.
[34:00.99]Wait, do I keep everything from la- Oh, I do!
[34:04.23]I keep everything!
[34:06.40]I still have the magnet.
[34:07.50]That's pretty awesome.
[34:16.22]I gotta get in the corner.
[34:22.29]Get up there.
[34:24.99]Damn it.
[34:29.99]Damn it.
[34:32.67]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[34:40.88]Magnet run.
[34:41.88]Magnet run.
[34:44.98]Why can't I go in there?
[34:54.04]Is there a button somewhere I'm missing?
[34:58.03]Get it!
[34:58.37]I almost have 10 health.
[35:05.88]Oh, there's one problem I'm seeing with the magnet.
[35:07.50]I can't do the fireball.
[35:08.62]I don't think the fireball is possible to do.
[35:11.06]Because it gets stuck.
[35:28.23]How'd I get in that door?
[35:32.14]Draw off the Maginar, I'm going to bed.
[35:38.72]Relax!
[35:39.34]What?
[35:39.52]This is just a slime room.
[35:45.53]Holy fuck, that was... Okay.
[35:59.13]I had to use it.
[36:02.31]Wait!
[36:02.63]What's my... What happened?
[36:03.79]My paddle's back to normal.
[36:05.21]I don't have a magnet anymore?
[36:08.86]I draw... Okay, you're staying up then.
[36:11.96]You're not going to bed anymore.
[36:17.36]You lose whatever you get when you... Oh, that sucks.
[36:20.23]Okay, well, good to know.
[36:35.10]Holy shit, dude.
[36:35.72]Jerm is a god at Breakout.
[36:37.14]I appreciate that.
[36:41.20]Thank you.
[36:48.76]What's going on?
[36:52.54]Oh.
[36:55.11]I think I just got Luigi'd.
[36:59.41]If it becomes impossible, it just gives it to you.
[37:01.61]That's pretty cool.
[37:02.29]I'm gonna sneeze, though, just to make everyone aware.
[37:16.87]I do actually like Breakout.
[37:18.21]It's fun.
[37:21.73]I don't know what that does, but I don't know if those are bad, apparently, somehow.
[37:24.97]I don't even know what that is, so I'm not going to answer it.
[37:39.96]What do these slimes do?
[37:41.00]I'm terrified to touch them.
[37:49.35]Jerma, quick, give me your opinion on this thing.
[37:50.93]You don't know what it is.
[37:53.15]Oh, alright.
[38:06.70]He knows.
[38:07.38]Go make a wall.
[38:08.20]He knows.
[38:10.82]He doesn't... He doesn't actually know.
[38:13.50]I don't know what you're doing.
[38:17.49]Guys, I didn't know what Uh-Oh Stinky was.
[38:25.67]Why would I know what anything else is?
[38:34.32]And yes, I've seen the video.
[38:38.48]I've seen it.
[38:39.08]How do you know what Ayaya is?
[38:43.41]Well, that's easy because I... You know how many times I've seen that link put in chats on Twitch?
[38:49.29]You know how many times I've been linked to that video randomly by people?
[38:54.05]You know how many times I've seen that random thing pop up?
[38:57.01]I've seen those words pop up a hundred times?
[39:08.30]Apologize.
[39:09.12]I already did.
[39:09.92]I said I was sorry like five times.
[39:17.53]How many times do I have to apologize every day?
[39:20.69]Hey everybody, welcome to another stream.
[39:27.10]This is stream number 15 since the Ayaya incident.
[39:31.62]Just want to make sure I make this really well aware.
[39:34.18]I'm really sorry about that.
[39:35.94]I'm incredibly sorry.
[39:36.76]I'm embarrassed about it.
[39:37.55]Ooh, huge paddle.
[39:49.51]No, I don't want this one.
[39:50.77]Alright, that's good.
[39:57.34]Is this even any bigger?
[39:58.16]It doesn't even look that bad much bigger.
[40:03.53]Yeah, I have to apologize every day for saying the... doing the ayaya thing.
[40:10.05]I have to say sorry every day.
[40:19.51]Alright, don't die because you'll lose your power-ups.
[40:22.52]Alright, shoot him.
[40:28.56]God damn it, come on.
[40:30.06]And I didn't even need to do that.
[40:32.22]Ugh!
[40:34.00]You have to apologize to God.
[40:37.88]Apologize on Twitter.
[40:44.64]I already did my apology.
[40:46.04]I already said I was sorry.
[40:48.52]I don't have to... I'm not apologizing on Twitter.
[40:57.28]That would break my... Uh oh.
[40:59.17]Get it off!
[40:59.61]Off!
[41:00.77]That would break my rule of having five tweets a year that aren't going live tweets.
[41:18.83]Get in that cave.
[41:19.53]It's gonna be a bonus room.
[41:21.38]I just know it.
[41:23.50]What the fuck is that?
[41:32.38]You have five new tweets?
[41:33.82]No, I don't.
[41:35.27]What are you spamming here?
[41:40.43]Attention to parents and grandparents.
[41:42.45]Herbal life.
[41:43.13]Hold on.
[41:43.71]You're gonna make me pause the game for this.
[41:46.21]Get in the cave.
[41:47.25]Fall in cave.
[41:48.11]Fall in cave.
[41:48.77]Attention parents.
[41:52.11]I don't even know what it is.
[41:55.09]Look at all this money.
[41:55.85]Attention parents, your incredible life is excruciating for their affordable growth plan.
[42:00.05]Alright, whatever.
[42:07.22]This is crazy.
[42:09.68]Oh, I got them all so far.
[42:10.74]Come on, keep it going.

[42:27.52]Yep, I'm gonna get them all.
[42:31.24]Ha ha ha ha ha, funny memes!
[42:38.63]Have you ever listened to penis music before?
[42:41.81]You just replaced a noun with the word penis.
[42:45.79]That's all you did.
[42:50.37]I mean, come on.
[42:51.41]You gotta get a little more effort than that.
[43:05.34]There's gotta be some more effort than that.
[43:12.31]You guys critique my jokes sometimes, it's time to critique yours.
[43:32.80]Just kidding, I'm not gonna hit that one, ever.

[44:12.27]It's Pac-Man-ing.
[44:15.21]Holy shit, it is Pac-Man-ing.
[44:22.39]I don't know, this is perfect.
[44:26.50]I don't have to do anything.
[44:29.90]I do, I'm gonna shoot this one.
[44:31.00]Didn't even need, alright.
[44:32.80]No, no, no, no, no, no.

[44:38.66]Yes, yes Did the raid just come in or am I crazy?
[44:51.61]Why is it not listed here?
[45:01.17]Was there a raid it's not on my why is it not on my stream labs?
[45:06.69]It's I mean it says
[45:08.75]Who came in with a raid?
[45:13.53]It was a while ago?
[45:14.45]When was it?

[45:20.50]Where?
[45:20.80]No, it wasn't.
[45:26.10]No, this just happened, like, right now.
[45:34.92]Why is this?
[45:35.60]I swear to God, I just saw that a raid came in.
[45:41.04]From Gmart?
[45:44.40]Am I making this up?
[45:53.20]I swear to God.
[46:01.95]I have to be insane.
[46:02.93]I swear to God I looked over and I saw it.
[46:07.81]Whoever you are, thank you for fucking raiding.
[46:09.51]Seriously.
[46:10.35]Thanks for the raid.
[46:11.19]I swear to god this happened.
[46:12.68]I'm not crazy.
[46:26.03]Is somebody hosting this channel right now called Gmart or something?
[46:32.86]It was like 600 people.
[46:34.40]I swear to God, I'm not insane.
[46:37.35]Thank you so much for the raid.
[46:38.59]Seriously.
[46:55.91]No, yeah, thanks a lot.
[46:57.19]Seriously, whatever you were doing, hopefully you had a good time.
[46:59.87]We're playing... We are playing... I just lost my paddle.
[47:05.39]Fuck.
[47:06.13]We're playing this breakout game.
[47:07.43]It's only $3 on Steam.
[47:10.89]You can do shit like that.
[47:12.21]Pretty damn cool.
[47:17.61]Welcome, though.
[47:18.21]Welcome.
[47:22.79]Get it.
[47:27.19]Sponsored.
[47:27.69]Sponsored by a $3 game.
[47:28.55]What are you talking about?
[47:35.44]This was made with passion and love.
[47:42.18]And they're charging almost nothing for it.
[47:44.72]I thought I was going to bounce higher.
[47:54.99]Alright, I can't get cocky.
[47:59.88]That was pretty PogChamp right there, I'll tell you.
[48:02.84]That was pog.
[48:11.57]But yeah, like I said again, welcome.
[48:15.75]I'm saying your name right.
[48:19.19]Gmar, right?
[48:19.93]Gmar?
[48:25.01]You're so bad at this.
[48:25.93]I'm playing on hard!
[48:26.45]What are you talking about?
[48:29.45]So why did that not show up in my streamlabs?
[48:32.29]I saw it, like, below by the chat.
[48:53.86]That's a lot of free... That's two free lives.
[49:09.34]I wonder how many levels are in the game.
[49:13.74]Holy fuck!
[49:26.66]Another door.
[49:27.26]And there's another key?
[49:29.06]What is this?
[49:30.76]The orb starts at speed twice slower.
[49:33.26]Yeah, let's get it.
[49:35.38]And, give it a little magic, too.
[49:48.30]Holy shit.
[49:49.42]Wait.
[49:51.08]Oh, I didn't want to do that.
[49:54.20]Yeah, that's too slow.
[49:57.36]I just increased the time I'm going to play the game by 50% or 100%.
[49:59.53]That's all I did.
[50:00.31]More time on stream.
[50:16.87]Yeah, I don't like this.
[50:17.49]I want it to be faster.
[50:25.78]No, I didn't want to do that either.
[50:26.88]Fuck.
[50:29.38]I'm gonna... Alright, I'm gonna let it fall.
[50:30.68]I'm gonna let it fall.
[50:32.32]I'm gonna let it fall.
[50:33.54]Just fall.
[50:34.10]I don't want this anymore.
[50:38.40]I still have it, don't I?
[50:39.14]Do I still have it?
[50:49.75]No, I don't?
[50:54.84]I feel like this is slower.
[50:55.80]I know, I'm trying to get it.
[51:01.16]I can't get it.
[51:01.78]It's too- it's a weird spot.
[51:03.76]Your reaction times have ascended here.
[51:22.75]Yeah, just throw coins in the trash, you're right.
[51:25.35]Unfortunate.
[51:27.83]Unfortunate.
[51:43.79]Damn it!
[51:44.46]I tried.
[51:44.92]I tried again to sneak it in there.
[51:46.66]Oh, it would've been awesome too.
[51:48.94]It would've been so cool.
[51:51.10]Oh well.
[51:56.79]I would have eaten everything.
[51:59.03]How many of you guys got a pizza?
[52:05.44]Seriously, how many?
[52:27.49]At least, like, three of you?
[52:28.41]Actually you?
[52:29.13]Good.
[52:31.32]Explain how it tastes to me.
[52:35.30]How is it?
[52:35.72]Like, is it crunchy?
[52:37.08]Is it doughy?
[52:37.78]Is it deep?
[52:39.36]Explain it to me.
[52:41.69]In full detail.
[52:44.64]Is the sauce tangy?
[52:45.98]Is the sauce... Is it, like, thin sauce?
[52:49.34]Is it soupy?
[52:50.10]You know, don't ever think that a soup pizza is bad at... Fuck.
[52:55.22]Alright.
[52:56.25]If you don't guess what it was, me and Burgah Boy used to call them soup pizzas.
[52:59.87]Because when you got a fresh, hot pizza that was so hot that just came out of the oven...
[53:05.01]where the cheese, the sauce, and the oil all mix together into this moving lava.
[53:11.87]And you pick up a piece of pizza, and it's just, the whole thing is liquid.
[53:17.16]That's a soup pizza.
[53:18.48]And don't, don't think that a soup pizza is not good.
[53:22.86]It can be very good.
[53:31.51]And sometimes it's like, alright, this sucks, but it's a soup pizza, it's pretty good.
[53:36.41]You pick up a slice and it all just starts, it's all liquid, all really, really thin.
[53:40.85]And you have to fold it together and like, you keep having to do this shit.
[53:45.82]Hold on, pause it.
[53:47.66]You keep having to do this shit.
[53:48.74]Can you guys even see me?
[53:53.62]You keep having to do this, right?
[53:55.38]So, you have to keep going like, like, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, over and over again with the cheese.
[54:06.91]He's handsome?
[54:11.06]Not really.
[54:12.58]Yes, I am.
[54:17.82]You'll go in for a bite, and everything will start to fall, and you put your hand under here, and your hand's accepting hot lava.
[54:24.22]And you fold it back up on top of the pizza, and like... And you keep folding it on top of each other and eating it, and eventually you churn it like butter.
[54:36.45]It sucks, but sometimes it's okay.
[54:44.15]Sometimes it's actually exactly what you're looking for.
[54:55.81]Worst noise of 2020.
[54:56.83]Well, make sure you clip it because you'll make sure you remember where it is.
[55:00.75]Damn it.
[55:18.24]It's not going to hit it, is it?
[55:19.18]Yes, it is.
[55:26.33]Do you own more than three shirts?
[55:30.57]Yes, I do.
[55:33.03]These are comfortable.
[55:35.27]You have no idea how comfortable this Nightwing shirt is.
[55:39.01]You have no idea.
[55:40.91]It's ridiculous.
[55:42.41]It is the most soft, wonderful material.
[55:45.89]And it's washed.
[55:47.09]I wear it a couple times and you wash it.
[55:48.49]It's one of the most comfortable things I own.
[55:56.62]Plus, I like to fucking, like, pretend I'm Nightwing.
[56:00.94]Not even, not as cool as Batman, and I used to be Robin, remember me?
[56:06.94]But I got two fucking batons now.
[56:12.35]Cool, it's the, it's cooler than Robin, and like, definitely like, definitely like sexier than Batman, you know what I mean?
[56:20.87]Nightwing.
[56:22.61]Bruce Wayne ain't got nothing on me, okay?
[56:26.07]Was it Drew Carey?
[56:27.52]What's his name?
[56:30.92]Not Drew Carey.
[56:32.20]Who is Nightwing?
[56:38.22]Who is Nightwing?
[56:42.38]Not Bruce Wayne.
[56:43.46]I'm talking about Nightwing.
[56:46.60]Yeah, Drew Carey.
[56:56.17]Good, good.
[56:56.99]Drew Carey can be Nightwing if you want.
[56:58.89]Did you see how fucking PogChamp that just was?
[57:09.17]That was the most pog- put- nominate that shit.
[57:21.19]Watch this, ready?
[57:26.84]What is that?
[57:28.84]Oh my goodness Fuck, it's okay Yeah, Batman's old news
[57:59.44]God damn it, I didn't move my hand fast enough.
[58:07.78]Dude, he's begging for nominations.
[58:10.43]Eye roll.
[58:11.09]Uh, me and Joel are gonna play the bomb game.
[58:17.35]Yes, we were supposed to play it today.
[58:19.31]But, uh, he kind of last second got, uh, ill.
[58:23.63]I think he was feeling under the weather.
[58:25.95]So instead of it being... Alright, let's... We want Joel to be in, you know, peak health while we do that, so... He wasn't feeling well.
[58:35.53]So I just was like, you know what, fine, it's all good.
[58:37.23]I'll just do something else today.
[58:38.65]And we'll do it tomorrow.
[58:42.03]Obviously, if Joel's feeling alright.
[58:47.10]Otherwise, we'll do something else.
[58:51.76]There we go, get in there.
[58:54.67]Should I do the bigger paddle?
[58:55.49]Yeah.
[58:59.80]And... No, that's fine.
[59:05.26]Joel's streaming the bomb game right now.
[59:08.51]Now, that would have actually been pretty hilarious.
[59:12.57]Um, can you imagine if... Hey, sorry, um, no, we're not doing it.
[59:17.33]And then just streaming it with somebody else.
[59:21.32]You'd be like, oh, shit.
[59:23.95]No, I can assure you that is not the case.
[59:25.97]I don't like these ice blocks.
[59:39.81]Don't do it.
[59:40.25]Neither does... Whoa!
[59:51.27]I don't like Ice Block.
[59:52.93]Oh, and neither does... Oh, anybody that played WoW PvP back in 2005.
[60:00.99]Fuck!
[60:02.43]I tried to stop it.
[60:10.77]I'm sorry.
[60:11.35]I fucking couldn't stop.
[60:12.53]I couldn't stop it.
[60:13.89]I couldn't stop it, I had to say.
[60:15.08]I couldn't stop.
[60:16.54]I tried to stop.
[60:24.25]Don't worry, I'll apologize for the next, like, five days straight.
[60:26.33]Don't worry.
[60:27.65]You're a psycho.
[60:31.38]Who said that?
[60:52.71]I love this game.
[60:53.47]This game is actually fun.
[60:54.55]This is just a fun game just to sit here and just dick around.
[61:04.72]Come on, get back in there.
[61:07.16]Is there a button I can press?
[61:11.42]But no, long story short, yeah, we'll do Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes tomorrow.
[61:16.07]We're very prepared for it.
[61:19.03]Like I said earlier, I think a lot of people really are underestimating just how much we're going to be prepared for these streams.
[61:26.15]Or the stream, whatever it is.
[61:29.87]I'm going to take it dead serious.
[61:31.31]Even if he does not take it seriously, I'm going to take it as dead serious as humanly possible.
[61:36.53]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[61:39.63]I'm going to be very clear with my instructions.
[61:42.21]I'm not going to... Whoa, what if I say this and I fuck it up?
[61:46.70]Laugh!
[61:48.39]laugh nope not gonna happen oh dude I'm gonna say cut like the blue wire and he's gonna cut it he's gonna explode and it's gonna be no I'm gonna try as hard as I fucking can whoa he actually he can get attacked
[62:29.87]I'm so excited for the explode joke next stream.
[62:34.31]That's not gonna happen.
[62:36.03]I mean, we're probably gonna lose.
[62:40.07]It's a very complicated game.
[62:49.01]He's dead?
[62:55.68]Oh, jelly beans?
[62:57.18]What did I just get?
[63:04.76]Keep pogging and nobody explodes.
[63:07.68]Should I go back?
[63:08.14]Yeah, let's go back and see what the town looks like now.
[63:12.06]Oh, look at this!
[63:22.64]I can go in the houses.
[63:24.85]Oh, it's the tavern.
[63:26.15]This is cool.
[63:26.97]I guess this is opening up me.
[63:31.32]Heard that everywhere else in Gerudo, people turned into ghosts and vanished.
[63:35.64]Isn't that creepy?
[63:37.90]Do you sell stuff?
[63:41.86]Can I play the piano?
[63:42.42]I don't think so.
[63:48.87]Ooh, a chest.
[63:52.01]I'm not sure I can do anything with this yet.
[63:58.29]Dog oh I can't take their okay.
[64:09.33]I would have never believed that such a hideous creatures existed if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes She's talking about you can I go to the dog house
[64:33.75]I want to do it too
[65:06.45]Alright, I did the shop.
[65:07.33]Let's go to the shop.
[65:13.69]I already own all this stuff.
[65:15.53]I'm out.
[65:19.03]Slow.
[65:20.23]Alright.
[65:21.60]Farmer?
[65:22.22]The windmill.
[65:23.96]Watermill.
[65:25.22]People are starving.
[65:26.12]350.
[65:26.58]Yes.
[65:27.04]Thank you.
[65:29.06]You got an extra life.
[65:29.80]Good.
[65:33.22]Can I repair this?
[65:34.40]Or...
[65:36.01]Provide the entire time with milk.
[65:37.93]Alright, let's fix the farm.
[65:41.45]350.
[65:41.55]Except this, you got an extra life.
[65:44.45]Cool.
[65:48.13]Anything else need to be fixed?
[65:49.01]Couple houses up here.
[65:49.83]What is this for?
[65:52.27]The mayor cares more for his citizens than for himself.
[65:55.69]I'd rebuild this house if I had the funds.
[65:57.38]999.
[65:58.10]Alright, well, I don't have that.
[66:00.12]Alright, well, let's just build this house back up then.
[66:06.53]OMEGALUL link I had to like double take for a second here Bomb game don't tell Jerma
[66:37.99]Don't tell them.
[66:38.77]Don't tell them.
[66:46.83]Imagine if this is real.
[66:56.00]Imagine if it was real.
[66:58.92]Now that would be ridiculous.
[67:00.76]Alright, this is terrible.
[67:01.58]These monsters took away everything.
[67:03.59]Here.
[67:04.19]250.
[67:05.13]I got a key.
[67:06.85]What about you?
[67:09.88]What do you need?
[67:11.68]How could those monsters destroy a statue?
[67:13.56]Boo hoo!
[67:14.06]Donate 500 for the statue!
[67:15.48]I don't have it.
[67:16.24]Alright, let's go.
[67:16.68]That sounds gross.
[67:42.45]Don't make them meatballs, they're wrong.
[67:49.80]What does that thing in the middle mean?
[67:56.86]Stay up there, get up top.
[68:08.43]Oh, my fucking hand slipped.
[68:09.63]It's alright.
[68:10.65]I don't have any power-ups anyways.
[68:12.43]Greed?
[68:24.81]Well, yeah.
[68:25.35]I need that money to rebuild the whole town.
[68:38.53]Should've saved it, that was dumb.
[68:47.73]Alright, top 5 favorite superheroes.
[68:50.07]Or supervillains.
[68:50.99]They can both be on the same list.
[68:52.23]Who are they?
[68:53.93]That's a good question, let's find out.
[68:56.57]Hmm.
[69:00.46]Peter?
[69:02.49]That's not a superhero.
[69:04.37]That's just... That's a word that I've said a few times.
[69:11.73]Alright, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go... Hmm... Shit, this is tough.
[69:32.07]Who's the best, coolest... It's too bad because I would have said... I would say Deadpool.
[69:42.48]But Deadpool has been meme-ified now.
[69:44.72]You know what I'm saying?
[69:46.16]It's very hipster of me to say that.
[69:48.39]Deadpool is too popular for me to say that now.
[70:16.22]So many people were just like, what the fuck, fuck you, man.
[70:21.36]Uh, no, alright, it's probably Deadpool.
[70:30.99]Um... Spider-Man, Deadpool.
[70:41.96]lame stop I'm trying to have conflicting backtracking opinions stop stop stop it don't you understand I'm saying something engaging what everybody says and then I'm just gonna go with what you are all saying and backtrack I'm gonna make a statement and then I immediately tell you otherwise and see what you guys say and then I'm gonna that's what my opinion is gonna be
[71:17.42]Dude, this guy's fucking smart.
[71:20.04]No, for real though, no jokes.
[71:22.18]No bullshit.
[71:23.00]It's probably Spider-Man.
[71:23.84]Spider-Man.
[71:30.52]It's Spider-Man.
[71:31.08]It's definitely Spider-Man.
[71:31.86]It's Spider-Man.
[71:34.49]What's cooler than Spider-Man?
[71:35.47]Nothing's cooler than Spider-Man.
[71:38.85]It's not Captain America.
[71:40.13]I'm sorry.
[71:40.53]I'm going to have to put my foot down there.
[71:41.95]It's not Captain America.
[71:43.93]It's Spider-Man.
[71:46.81]Spider-Man.
[71:48.57]Venom.
[71:54.68]Aquaman.
[71:55.30]No.
[71:56.18]No.
[71:57.76]I don't think so.
[71:58.42]Not for me.
[72:00.80]He makes great t-shirts, but not for a superhero.
[72:03.34]Um...
[72:16.47]Some of the X-Men, too.
[72:19.17]The problem with the X-Men is, the X-Men were so cool, and then they made... Like, the last two or three movies were just real bad.
[72:26.70]So it's kind of... They gotta get the X-Men in somebody else's hands.
[72:34.92]The actors were fine for the X-Men, I think.
[72:37.40]Um...
[72:41.24]When I was younger, it was Gambit.
[72:43.26]What is this?
[72:43.66]The magic wand launches three at once.
[72:48.58]Oh, fuck yeah.
[72:54.33]Gambit was my favorite superhero when I was like 14, 15, 16.
[72:57.63]Eh, might still be.
[73:06.27]They haven't put Gambit anywhere, really.
[73:08.76]Besides the cartoon.
[73:09.80]Okay, I'm going to have to show you guys some skill here.
[73:27.45]Alright.
[73:34.81]Do I get three balls at once forever?
[73:37.76]Yeah, I do.
[73:38.08]Alright, I gotta be really, really good here.
[73:54.93]That fucked it up.
[73:55.61]Sorry.
[74:06.45]What does that even do?
[74:07.31]Is it taking my health?
[74:09.33]Wait, is it taking my health?
[74:22.00]It drains you magic.
[74:22.94]Ah, that sucks.
[74:23.92]I'm so happy you get this for every level, though.
[74:26.16]This is great.
[74:28.44]Not much I can do there.
[74:35.54]Oh fuck, that instantly kills you.
[74:46.42]Yeah, the Avengers are cool.
[74:49.26]They're alright, they're interesting.
[74:55.30]Although, is it weird that I really only like those movies because Spider-Man's in them?
[75:00.58]Even though they're good.
[75:17.21]I love that latest Spider-Man.
[75:18.59]Spider-Man movies are great.
[75:19.53]I love them.
[75:20.05]All of them.
[75:20.33]They're all so good.
[75:28.52]Me hate popular thing.
[75:29.90]Me interesting.
[75:30.76]Wait, what?
[75:33.34]Spider-Man is insanely popular.
[75:35.44]He's like the most popular superhero ever.
[75:38.84]It's the Deadpool thing that I said, isn't it?
[75:41.12]People are going to be mad at me now.
[75:44.29]I like Deadpool.
[75:45.59]I was just fucking... I was just joshing everybody.
[76:09.11]Super villain, though.
[76:14.13]Hmm.
[76:15.83]Spider-Man superhero.
[76:20.32]Who's the best, like, who's the best villain?
[76:32.27]Mr. Freeze?
[76:35.29]That's not a bad pick.
[76:40.11]That's not a bad pick.
[76:41.73]I don't know.
[76:49.57]Who else, though?
[76:53.17]I like the Riddler.
[76:53.85]The Riddler's cool.
[76:56.10]Because the Riddler doesn't even have any superpowers.
[77:00.08]He's just a dick.
[77:06.17]Like, the Riddler doesn't have superpowers.
[77:07.99]He's just like... He's just like a really good lawyer.
[77:20.43]Alright, uh, get the balls again.
[77:22.49]He was super intelligent.
[77:32.59]Yeah, but... That's alright.
[77:35.22]I mean, yeah, that's fine, but... Riddler sucks just tells shitty puns.
[77:42.67]I was kind of sad when in the Christopher Nolan series it was Bane.
[77:49.54]I really thought it was going to be the Riddler and we were going to get a Christopher Nolan Riddler and that would have been awesome.
[77:55.81]Can you imagine a Christopher Nolan Riddler?
[78:12.03]I missed it.
[78:13.20]I have to keep him alive.
[78:17.30]Weren't they in talks to maybe do a Riddler?
[78:21.02]Long time ago.
[78:22.42]Why do I feel like it was gonna be Johnny Depp?
[78:24.38]Why have I heard that somewhere?
[78:28.98]Am I insane?
[78:41.47]Jim Carrey?
[78:41.97]Yeah, but the only Riddler we ever got on TV was... or in the movies, was the guy from the 60s, and Jim Carrey.
[78:49.83]And although I love Jim Carrey's Riddler, it was more the Joker than it was the Riddler.
[78:54.34]But he still was good.
[78:55.54]I fucked it up.
[79:08.87]Get stuck in there.
[79:09.55]How did you even get out?
[79:17.53]The Arkham Riddler was the best one.
[79:18.85]Yeah, it was pretty good.
[79:22.43]It was.
[79:26.82]We haven't got a TV or movie Riddler.
[79:29.22]Besides, I mean, the one from Gotham.
[79:31.46]I don't really watch Gotham, though.
[79:32.54]Is that a good show?
[79:43.00]I'm seeing a lot of conflicting opinions here.
[79:46.22]Of course not.
[79:52.54]Wasn't the penguin good on that show, though?
[79:56.26]I heard that was the reason to watch the show, because the penguin was really good.
[80:03.38]Oh, the wind?
[80:03.96]Yeah, I'm an idiot.
[80:15.34]Yeah, alright, if we already got a really good penguin locked down, then we gotta get him to move it.
[80:26.59]Danny DeVito was the best penguin.
[80:30.25]I mean, that's not even up for debate, though.
[80:32.41]Yeah, that's... But Danny DeVito, I don't know, how old is Danny DeVito now?
[80:47.13]That movie is so awful, even though DeVito's great.
[80:49.31]Yeah.
[80:57.13]I don't remember much of that movie.
[81:00.63]But I... No, I can't say that.
[81:02.24]Michael Keaton's in that movie.
[81:04.76]It's automatically a good movie.
[81:06.80]If you guys didn't know, Michael Keaton's, like, my favorite actor.
[81:24.76]Alright, I gotta... Hold on.
[81:25.66]This thing is launching around.
[81:26.66]Have I seen Birdman?
[81:28.76]Yes, I have.
[81:29.72]This is fantastic.
[81:35.01]He was great as... Batman.
[81:37.87]He was great in Birdman.
[81:41.67]He was great in... Spider-Man.
[81:45.07]All the other... All the man movies.
[81:47.70]He was great in... Beetlejuice.
[82:04.70]It's one of those scenarios where anytime there's a Beetlejuice ever again, it's just going to be, you're not Michael Keaton.
[82:11.54]I don't like this movie.
[82:12.68]You're not Michael Keaton.
[82:13.82]No, we can't.
[82:14.82]It's not going to work.
[82:16.56]It's impossible.
[82:19.66]It has to be Michael Keaton.
[82:21.02]It can't be anybody else.
[82:23.12]It can't be.
[82:29.49]What is this one?
[82:31.60]The evolve deals double damage until it's lost.
[82:34.10]Um, okay, I gotta re- Wait, does that mean I get double damage and the three balls?
[82:41.81]No.
[82:47.75]Yeah, Michael Keaton.
[82:48.55]That's great.
[82:52.77]Who else do- What other actors do I really like?
[82:55.37]What's my superhero, uh, actor list, I think?
[82:58.68]Hmm.
[83:01.87]Michael Keaton.
[83:11.00]Tom Holland.
[83:11.92]Yeah, but... We'll see, though.
[83:15.00]Tom Holland is awesome.
[83:16.72]Got a long career ahead of him.
[83:19.96]Ask me in 15 years.
[83:24.54]Willem Dafoe, Jim Carrey.
[83:27.54]Yeah.
[83:39.32]Woody Harrelson?
[83:41.90]Yeah.
[83:43.06]Woody Harrelson's pretty good, too.
[83:54.37]Don't die.
[83:55.22]I was trying to sneak it in.
[84:03.88]Sorry.
[84:16.19]Uh, Cate Blanchett is awesome in almost everything.
[84:20.71]Who else?
[84:30.82]Ooh!
[84:35.84]Ryan Gosling.
[84:40.39]Yeah, he's done some good work.
[84:43.13]He's done some good work, you're right.
[84:50.03]Die!
[84:51.19]Sorry.
[84:52.04]Fuck.
[84:52.80]I needed that.
[84:53.58]No, I didn't.
[85:01.96]You know who actually tops that list, besides Michael Keaton, is probably Gene Wilder.
[85:10.10]Gene Wilder was awesome in everything.
[85:13.12]In everything.
[85:19.88]original Willy Wonka yeah and way more on an incredibly storied career he was just so interesting he was so funny and fun and everything he said was just you carried weight it was he was amazing
[85:53.92]Gene Wilder influenced a lot of people that you watch now.
[86:01.09]Including me.
[86:03.37]So, you're here now.
[86:05.83]Oh, fuck.
[86:06.39]Don't touch anything.
[86:17.44]God damn it, why am I so stupid about that?
[86:19.40]I gotta be...
[86:24.67]Hold on, wait, I want to know what this means.
[86:26.37]Somebody said, I feel like I'm at a family get-together.
[86:29.36]And then they said, ResidentSleeper.
[86:31.10]Wait, do you mean that this is as boring as being at a family get-together?
[86:38.18]Well, go get fucking Yahtzee!
[86:40.70]Or Uno!
[86:41.44]What are you doing?
[86:42.68]Why is that my fault?
[86:49.80]Go open up Monopoly and play six rounds and then everybody has to leave.
[86:56.90]Speaking of Monopoly, we should play Monopoly.
[87:07.42]Do I have Uno?
[87:09.48]I don't remember how to play Uno, if I'm honest with you.
[87:11.80]I really don't know.
[87:13.46]You're supposed to be the entertainer.
[87:22.88]Yeah, but I'm like stuck here.
[87:27.76]I'm like in traffic right now.

[87:33.34]And I'm... I'm alright.
[87:41.31]You have Uno.
[87:42.49]What do you mean I have... How do you know I have Uno?

[88:08.64]What is this?
[88:17.44]You have Uno.
[88:20.37]I don't have Uno.
[88:25.25]Why is me saying I don't have Uno as strange as me saying when I turn the faucet, no water comes out?
[88:32.07]What are you talking about?
[88:33.26]You fucking turn your faucet?
[88:34.48]What are you... What?
[88:40.60]Like, it's not as... What are you talking about?

[88:47.52]Oh, I'm getting memed on.

[93:19.42]I haven't talked to you about the whole thing.
[93:21.86]I've heard that you can cast special magic spells if you press a magic button when the orb hits the magic wand.

[94:05.00]Um... I was talking about cleaning games.
[94:08.18]And this is like, I don't know, maybe three or four days ago?
[94:10.82]When I last streamed?
[94:11.88]Before New Year's?
[94:14.10]And it was like, oh, you would love Chibi-Robo!

[94:17.87]That sounds like fun.
[94:19.45]This fucking game is $200.
[94:21.17]Is this like some extremely rare video game?
[94:26.67]It's like 200 fucking bucks.
[94:33.74]Somebody just said, I have it.
[94:35.48]Um, well, you might be able to make, like, at least $180.
[94:40.86]Time to sell it.
[94:42.86]Yeah, yeah, all, yeah, all of you sell it.
[94:44.58]All of you sell it.
[94:45.20]Flood the market.
[94:45.92]Flood the market so it comes down to, like, fucking 80 bucks.
[94:49.68]So all of you sell.
[94:50.58]All of you sell.
[94:54.68]All of you sell it.
[94:59.12]Somebody said they have two copies.
[95:02.33]Holy shit, am I... You lose a life and it bounces back up.
[95:05.84]This could get really bad.
[95:09.24]I just lost two lives in a row.
[95:23.69]Have I thought I'm playing Control?
[95:29.42]Yeah, but control sits kind of in that weird spot.
[95:33.54]Kind of where Jedi Fallen Order is.
[95:35.21]It's something I want to do and want to play, but... I... I just... I'm probably not gonna.
[95:43.41]And why is this happening?
[95:53.80]Maybe... It's on the list.
[95:55.58]It is, but it would have to...
[96:02.15]Okay.
[96:04.97]Just like Breath of the Wild.
[96:07.69]I might play Breath of the Wild.
[96:09.19]I mean, I got, look, I have to come clean with you guys.
[96:11.73]I have to be completely realistic.
[96:13.80]I did put on the list of games, the ones that I've bought, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games 2020.
[96:20.76]So, could I really play that without playing Breath of the Wild?
[96:29.24]I feel like that would be upsetting to a lot of people.
[96:57.47]But yeah, also another game that I really, really want to play desperately.
[97:01.67]And this game is also $250 for the GameCube.
[97:06.66]It's called Gotcha Force.
[97:08.06]Anybody remember that one?
[97:15.16]Game was ridiculous.
[97:18.26]It was so much fun.
[97:26.81]Super Mario Sunshine is also on that list.
[97:29.25]What the fuck is this?
[97:41.76]10,000 for the crown?
[97:47.59]Jesus.
[97:51.51]I'm not getting a crown.
[97:52.37]It's not going to happen.
[97:59.90]I... fuck.
[98:01.08]I got distracted.
[98:07.26]When you have this shit out, I feel the same way about multiball and pinball.
[98:12.57]It's like you need to have two eyes going two different directions.
[98:22.35]OMEGALUL bits?
[98:23.55]Wait, what?
[98:24.91]Hold on.
[98:29.91]Bylacr just gave $250 in bits.
[98:35.16]25,000 bits.
[98:36.94]Buy Gachaforce, you sweaty streamer fuck.
[98:43.06]I'm gonna buy Gachaforce.
[98:45.44]I'm gonna buy it, and I'm gonna own it, and then I'm gonna be the guy that owns Gachaforce.
[98:54.79]I'll be one of, like, five people on Earth, and then I will lock it away.
[99:00.43]It's gonna be an asset that I hold for the rest of my life.
[99:02.43]Uh, but Phylacter, Jesus, that's... Insane amount of money, again.
[99:12.34]Let's be clear, again.
[99:15.10]Thanks a lot, dude, seriously.
[99:18.72]Buy it now, you fucking liar.
[99:20.18]I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy it!
[99:21.99]Jesus!
[99:43.80]Damn it.
[99:45.66]He's gonna use it on pizza instead.
[99:49.60]Okay, I'm gonna buy a $250 pizza.
[99:56.69]I'm gonna get a special ordered 600-foot wide pizza.
[100:00.83]Make it real soupy this time, too.
[100:06.35]Make it real soupy.
[100:13.39]Yeah, make me an old-fashioned old-fashioned work.
[100:22.29]I can't, I can't see.
[100:23.90]I can't, I can't see.
[100:25.80]He can't see, I can't see.
[100:28.42]Why am I quoting It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World?
[100:30.34]What the fuck is going on?
[100:40.29]That's a movie from like the fucking 50s.
[100:45.98]Have I quoted it before?
[100:48.68]Wait, hold on.
[100:49.20]I've quoted It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World before.
[100:55.23]When?
[100:55.47]I do it all the time?
[101:05.36]Do I actually do this?
[101:09.18]It's under the big W.
[101:12.90]It was Smilak Rogan and the Great Tuna Factory Robbery.
[101:19.25]Yeah, I used to watch that movie all the time when I was younger.
[101:31.69]In fact, when I was younger, we had that movie recorded on a blank VHS tape, but the movie is so long that we never got to see as kids the end of the movie because it was like 90 minutes for a VHS tape or something.
[101:46.33]It was 60 minutes.
[101:47.97]And we would always get to the apex of the entire movie and we never got to see it because we didn't have the second part recorded.
[101:54.11]So we just watched the first like hour and 12 minutes or whatever it was.
[102:04.82]My parents used to just describe... Oh, and by the way, this is what happens at the end.
[102:08.54]Oh, yeah, okay, that's funny.
[102:20.81]I'll give you a dollar.
[102:22.37]Um, three dollars.
[102:25.01]Three dollars!
[102:26.47]I'm remembering the whole movie.
[102:33.21]Ray, we're gonna have to kill him!
[102:37.35]At the gas station?
[102:38.84]Where Jonathan Winters is like freaking the fuck out and like beating the shit out of those two guys?
[102:49.10]Okay, has that movie influenced more in my life than I give it credit for?
[102:59.43]Probably.
[103:00.09]I don't know.
[103:05.17]I mean, that was one of like six VHS tapes that I had.
[103:08.94]So when I was, I don't know, 12, 10, 9, 10, 11, 12, I probably watched the first hour and 10 minutes of that movie 150 times.
[103:35.19]Listen to your mother!
[103:37.11]He's holding the two phones up and the mother is like yelling at the daughter?
[103:42.69]He's holding the- he's on two different phones.
[103:45.27]And he's talking to his daughter and his mother and he holds the phones up together.
[103:49.89]So they can talk to each other.
[103:52.99]I gotta watch this movie again.
[103:54.27]This movie's fucking crazy.
[104:04.30]That movie's not public domain, no way it is.
[104:12.66]Mama, I'm coming to save you!
[104:19.88]It's all coming back to me, it really is.
[104:28.39]Now that's what we call, lock it in there.
[104:36.77]I still- I can't afford that.
[104:45.29]There's that one scene where the two guys are fighting outside in like the sand, like the desert area.
[104:51.61]And they do the classic- I think they like came up with it maybe, I don't know.
[104:56.19]They both throw a punch at each other.
[104:58.63]And they connect with their fists in the air.
[105:03.73]And they get hurt.
[105:04.66]It's like fucking funny.
[105:08.29]They throw a punch at the exact same time and they fucking smash fists together.
[105:18.63]That's hilarious, Boomer.
[105:23.94]Hey!
[105:26.44]Some of the- come on!
[105:32.88]It's a comedy movie.
[105:40.93]It seriously has some great stunts in it.
[105:42.51]Yeah, it really was.
[105:45.49]It really was like a... I can't remember.
[105:47.27]Alright, we're gonna get in that right side.
[105:55.08]And then we don't.
[105:55.62]It's over.
[105:58.80]What movie?
[105:59.42]The movie's called It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
[106:03.56]It's the actual title of the movie.
[106:12.51]It's public domain?
[106:15.41]No, it's not.
[106:17.17]It's public domain?
[106:18.17]Am I, am I, wait, am I finally going to get to see the end of this movie?
[106:36.03]Yeah, I still want to do that.
[106:37.41]Watch public domain movies.
[106:42.56]In fact, I want to show you guys a skill called, we're going to watch a bunch of public domain movies, and we're going to do what I do when I watch regular movies sometimes on Netflix.
[106:52.67]And that's the, you'll get the gist of the entire movie.
[106:54.95]You watch for two minutes, and then you skip 20.
[106:57.91]Watch for three minutes, skip 30 minutes.
[107:00.35]Watch for five minutes, skip 10 minutes.
[107:16.80]Why would you do that?
[107:20.26]Um... What do you mean, why would I do that?
[107:27.16]I... Some... Guys, there are a lot of movies that aren't very good.
[107:32.83]And I just want to get the gist of them.
[107:53.24]You're a psycho.
[107:54.42]What?
[107:55.37]And watch movies that are good.
[107:56.41]Yeah, but sometimes... What's the last one I did it with?
[108:02.89]I did it with... Dad's Home 2?
[108:11.74]The one with John Cena and... No, yeah.
[108:13.98]The one with John... No.
[108:16.62]Will Ferrell?
[108:19.01]Will Ferrell and...
[108:22.39]You've heard this before.
[108:23.17]Yeah, I'm telling you, that's the last time I did it.
[108:29.47]Yeah, Mark Wahlberg, Will Ferrell.
[108:33.74]Yeah, I've seen that whole movie.
[108:35.78]I just have to skip like 20 minutes every five minutes.
[108:39.52]You'd be surprised how many movies you can watch and understand everything that's happening when you do this role.
[108:51.70]Can we just get in there, please?
[108:56.98]Come here.
[109:06.00]Just read the Wikipedia?
[109:09.42]No, that's- that's way worse.
[109:22.18]Yeah, at least I get to see some of the scenes in the movie.
[109:25.76]And I only do this with movies that are not good.
[109:32.01]Because I'm not going to do this with The Godfather.
[109:37.53]I think, like, the Sherlock Holmes Will Ferrell movie is not a movie I want to spend two fucking hours watching.
[109:42.38]So I'll watch it for 12 minutes.
[110:01.60]Plus, it means I can reference scenes so people think I actually watched the whole movie.
[110:08.39]I can reference specific quotes from the movie that I wouldn't know unless I saw it otherwise.
[110:12.51]So now at the office I can be like, remember that scene with the bees?
[110:19.35]Hey, remember that scene in Dad and Daddy's Home 2?
[110:26.02]With the thermostat, they all freak out.
[110:28.18]And they're like, who's changing the thermostat?
[110:29.82]And John Lithgow comes out and is like, it's a billion degrees in here.
[110:33.64]See?
[110:46.45]It's not hard.
[110:53.94]Alright, I don't want to die here.
[110:55.40]This is like the last level.
[110:59.50]Clean it up.
[111:01.42]Clean it up.
[111:16.14]One, two... Come on.
[111:21.55]Oh, I could play Bubble Bobble, too.
[111:23.19]That's a classic game.
[111:28.56]And no, not Buster Move.
[111:31.16]Not, ready, go!
[111:32.90]No, I'm talking about the original Bubble Bobble.
[111:36.64]They really threw those two dragons under the bus, by the way.
[111:39.82]Because, like, where's Bubble Bobble?
[111:41.76]Like, where's the actual Bubble Bobble game sequel?
[111:55.07]Buster move is better?
[111:57.39]That's... I don't think so.
[112:00.41]I don't think that's correct.
[112:04.29]They took those two dragons and turned them into an iPad game.
[112:09.53]And have they even appeared anywhere else ever?
[112:11.17]They were really iconic characters.
[112:12.96]What happened to them?
[112:17.70]What happened to those two dragons?
[112:29.72]They're public domain now.
[112:31.22]Alright.
[112:32.14]But really.
[112:36.51]Who owns those characters?
[112:37.41]Are those Namco characters?
[112:40.57]No.
[112:41.13]Konami?
[112:41.73]Who owns the two dragons?
[112:42.91]Taiko.
[112:47.47]Tai?
[112:48.78]Taito.
[112:49.40]Okay.
[112:54.60]What has Taito done recently?
[112:56.16]Anything?
[112:56.72]Or did they get liquidated somewhere?
[113:06.66]Nothing.
[113:09.92]They're under Square Enix now.
[113:11.00]Oh, okay.
[113:13.08]I'd love to see a new Bubble Bobble inspired video game with those two dragons.
[113:17.97]And I'm going to lose this game.
[113:21.51]Get in there.
[113:24.27]Finally.
[113:40.20]Get in there!
[113:44.65]This was always the worst when you played Breakout, when you ended up with one that you needed to get and it was just... you couldn't do it no matter what you did.
[113:49.97]Oh my god.
[114:11.95]Finally, jeez.
[114:15.87]Square Enix owns them now?
[114:16.89]I'm now picturing a Bubble Bobble RPG.
[114:21.69]It'd probably be pretty fun.
[114:30.98]What are the characters that the, uh, because Taito was around right from the very beginning of the NES.
[114:36.60]They probably have a bunch of characters.
[114:38.40]Are they, are they snake rattle and roll?
[114:41.02]Is it Snake, Rattle, and Roll, they title?
[114:43.96]Who owns Snake, Rattle, and Roll?
[114:47.24]Rare does?
[114:49.86]Why, what the hell are they doing?
[115:11.23]How have they not done Snake Rattle and Roll 2?
[115:19.39]I feel so bad for Rare, because I really feel like they're just, like, frozen in cryostasis.
[115:31.95]Like, they have Rare frozen in cryostasis, so Microsoft gets to walk into the museum where they are and just look at them every once in a while, and it'd be like if they have a big cigar in their mouth being like...
[115:41.75]That's right.
[115:43.05]I remember Banjo-Kazooie.
[115:45.67]Nobody else does.
[115:47.66]And then close the fucking door and lock it.
[115:49.12]Like, spoilers for Star Wars, but who cares?
[115:56.07]No, do people care about, like, the ones from the 70s?
[115:59.33]Probably.
[116:18.95]Who gives a fuck?
[116:24.31]Oh, no, that's right.
[116:25.21]That's not... It doesn't matter.
[116:25.99]I've already talked about it on stream because I've already shown it on stream.
[116:31.71]You can't stop me now.
[116:32.98]The carbonite is gone.
[116:34.42]Yeah, alright.
[116:36.72]That's true.
[116:55.58]How much money do you think that Raiden Solo makes because that song exists?
[117:03.34]What do you think?
[117:13.78]It's probably locked.
[117:20.82]Get in there.
[117:21.36]Wait, why is this locked?
[117:24.88]Don't waste all your gold.
[117:26.32]Actually, I can... Ready?
[117:28.68]This is going to be a big moment for me.
[117:31.08]No, it's not.
[117:31.56]I just, like, shook.
[117:32.22]I need more magic.
[117:34.58]Ah, I fucked it up.
[117:37.26]It's in just dance, too.
[117:44.79]Give me more magic.
[117:45.61]I could have done a huge line here.
[117:51.56]Do they still make Just Dance games?
[117:53.29]Yes, yeah, they do.
[117:55.15]In fact, I think they still release for the Wii.
[117:59.59]Original Wii, not Wii U. It's accurate, yeah.
[118:22.44]Pepsi.
[118:26.50]The Wii is still going pretty strong from my understanding.
[118:33.36]And the GameCube.
[118:34.63]I love those little discs.
[118:36.89]Little GameCube discs.
[118:38.49]Oh, they're so cool.
[118:46.47]They're so cool.
[118:47.13]I can't wait to spend $500 on two discs.
[118:58.98]Door.
[118:59.62]Oh, door, door, door.
[119:00.42]Yeah.
[119:05.90]Come on, get in there.
[119:07.94]Don't.
[119:08.70]I can't.
[119:09.32]Guys, it's hard to get it in there.
[119:12.44]Oh, well.
[119:22.25]Chibi-Robo.
[119:23.21]Look at this room.
[119:24.63]It's all treasure chests.
[119:32.42]Nice.
[119:33.64]Ooh.
[119:45.72]This is a fun game.
[119:46.70]This is a cute little game.
[119:48.02]Alright, let me tell you.
[119:48.90]You can tell when a game is good.
[119:50.16]Guys, I've spilt coffees on me that were more expensive than this.
[119:53.31]So, come on.
[120:06.09]You can- Time for the final boss?
[120:16.08]What kind of coffee is that expensive?
[120:19.28]A- a Trenta iced Frappuccino with extra sugar, double milk, double cream, 10 pumps of French vanilla.
[120:31.93]The drink is like $11.
[120:53.28]No, I don't owe to that.
[120:54.88]Oh, do, what am I doing?
[120:55.76]Do the thing!
[121:09.53]Thing is going fast!
[121:16.60]Thing is going faaaast!
[121:35.66]How big is the Trenta?
[121:36.36]Anybody know?
[121:39.04]How many ounces?
[121:40.36]And how big is the supersize that they, like, made illegal?
[121:42.68]30 ounces?
[121:46.80]What's the supersize?
[121:56.69]Supersize is 80?
[122:02.66]Wait, a supersize for McDonald's was 80 ounces?
[122:08.94]No, holy shit.
[122:15.67]Wait, how many ounces is in a two liter?
[122:19.17]Was a supersize as big as a two liter?
[122:39.92]No magic allowed on the final boss.
[122:41.46]I think that's an instant kill.
[122:42.92]Only four lives left.
[122:44.04]This could go to shit really quickly, actually.
[122:53.13]80 ounces is like three liters.
[122:54.49]I kind of want to look this up.
[123:00.19]What's the, um... The biggest purchasable large drink.
[123:09.61]Big Gulp from 7-Up.
[123:12.21]Supersize from McDonald's.
[123:13.47]Which one?
[123:13.71]What was it?
[123:16.27]Oh, fuck.
[123:16.65]There's another one.
[123:17.73]The Netherworld.
[123:23.05]Oh, wait.
[123:30.80]There's another one to build?
[123:34.02]Oh, look.
[123:34.24]There it is.
[123:34.56]Is that me?
[123:42.16]There we go.
[123:42.44]Alright, this is the mayor's house.
[123:51.29]Alright, so who do I talk to now?
[123:55.71]The four sacred children have the power of summoning the forces of nature.
[123:58.71]They could help us if we could find them.
[123:59.99]I got them.
[124:03.42]Have I ever heard of Fury?
[124:04.50]I've played Fury on stream.
[124:05.58]I think I got like halfway through it.
[124:10.94]And then like a lot of games I've ever played on this channel years ago.
[124:13.32]I sort of gave up on Yeah, I did like four years ago or something Okay, this looks ridiculous We're in the nether go back go back to the map I forgot about somebody
[124:47.64]I only have four lives left.

[124:56.47]Donate one GP.
[125:00.31]Haha, gotcha.
[125:00.77]I've never had a house, but thanks.
[125:05.58]Today's a great day for Tarot.
[125:06.76]Thanks to you, this town will flourish once again.
[125:08.74]Again, once evil is vanquished.
[125:10.88]By the way, we found this amulet piece in the debris.
[125:14.36]You got the fire amulet piece.
[125:20.32]What does that do?
[125:26.82]Alright, let's go.
[125:34.26]Oh, buy.
[125:34.76]I could buy.
[125:35.16]I'm even gonna buy stuff.
[125:35.96]I'm gonna buy hearts.
[125:37.48]Oh, here we go.
[125:43.67]Here's, uh... The biggest big gulps.
[125:46.85]The original fountain drink from McDonald's was 7 ounces.
[125:51.13]Hold on, let's see.
[125:53.09]Let's get this on screen.
[125:54.01]I want to look at this.
[126:00.11]Okay, so... The biggest of big gulps.
[126:08.17]The kid-sized McDonald's in 2012 was 12 ounces.
[126:14.62]Super-sized for McDonald's was 42 ounces.
[126:16.20]That's it?
[126:20.85]The Great Biggie from Wendy's.
[126:22.85]The King Size.
[126:23.61]They were all the same.
[126:25.55]The KFC Mega Jug?
[126:30.51]What is the KFC Mega Jug?
[126:34.45]The Beast?
[126:37.21]What is Arco?
[126:38.03]I've never heard of Arco.
[126:41.81]Like a gas station?
[126:46.91]The Humongous Come and Go.
[126:52.33]What the fuck?
[126:52.89]I feel like that's... Is that a made-up name?
[126:54.57]It's real?
[127:03.66]No, it's a... Come and Go is a convenience store.
[127:06.10]Okay, well, why is it... Why is it spelled like that?
[127:09.20]It's kind of like... Oh, okay.
[127:10.34]The Team Gulp from 7-Eleven was 128 ounces?
[127:14.49]What's the Team Gulp?
[127:27.78]This is just the thing that they dump on the coach when people win the football game.
[127:35.13]Team Gulp.
[127:37.25]Why would somebody order this?
[127:44.37]This is... this is just a trash barrel with... Yeah, this is gross.
[127:50.32]This is just like a weird trash barrel full of liquid.
[127:57.86]This is a gallon.
[128:01.38]Gross.
[128:11.51]Look at that thing.
[128:14.97]That's the thing that has fucking fertilizer in it, in your garage.
[128:20.90]You don't want to drink out of that.
[128:30.82]Propane tank?
[128:31.86]Yeah.
[128:33.41]Jesus.
[128:34.83]What is this?
[128:38.67]A Jerm of golf?
[128:40.33]This is coffee.
[128:42.93]I hate this picture.
[129:09.04]I don't even want this on camera.
[129:11.85]I don't want that on camera.
[129:12.91]That looks just... I don't like it.
[129:15.07]I do not like that picture.
[129:16.39]I don't like it.
[129:18.77]I'm not leaving it.
[129:19.43]Oh, wait.
[129:22.97]I was going to buy stuff here.
[129:23.71]I need more.
[129:30.32]Here we go.
[129:34.24]Let's refill all our magic.
[129:36.98]Let's get a bunch of health.
[129:41.92]Hey.
[129:44.66]One life.
[129:45.30]Oh, dude took ten.
[129:46.10]I think that's enough.
[129:53.51]Twelve.
[129:55.89]Alright, I guess I need a thousand.
[129:56.97]Let's go.
[129:59.73]We want it back.
[130:00.55]We want coffee mug back.
[130:04.83]No, it's just, I don't... That looks like a good cup of coffee, though.
[130:09.21]I love coffee.
[130:12.59]There's two things that are certain in life for me.
[130:14.59]That's pizza and coffee.
[130:16.51]Both of them.
[130:31.32]Can I kill these things?
[130:33.18]Ooh, they block.
[130:35.08]You fuckers.
[130:40.14]Gotta hit him from behind.
[130:41.44]Oh, shit.
[130:41.94]This is bad.
[130:42.58]Can you let us hear your BPM?
[130:57.58]Beats per minute?
[130:58.40]Like, my heart?
[131:01.18]How would you guys even be able to hear that?
[131:10.33]Put the microphone up to my chest and mute everything and make everything really, really quiet?
[131:16.34]I'm not even sure you still hear it.
[131:25.10]Get up there.
[131:25.68]Get up there!
[131:29.57]Try it?
[131:30.93]I feel like a lot of people will leave if I do that.
[131:32.59]That's... I mean, I... There's a difference between, like... I don't think people would want to hear that.
[131:43.22]Imagine if I put my chest up here, and it's like... Like, holy fuck, man.
[131:51.83]Jeremy, go to the doctor.
[131:52.83]It's like... That's not normal?
[132:03.35]Oh, I got it in the mouth.
[132:09.21]Oh boy.
[132:12.39]Really could use... this right now.
[132:17.33]Damn it.
[132:18.09]I don't have any more.
[132:29.18]There it is.
[132:29.60]I don't want to die!
[132:40.83]This reminds me of a cake.
[132:42.82]Yeah, it's kind of cakey.
[132:45.24]It's like a cake.
[132:51.29]Oh!
[132:51.81]I forgot to show you guys.
[132:52.81]I got something cool.
[132:55.07]I got something cool.
[132:57.65]Not like I forgot to show you guys.
[133:12.20]Hold on.
[133:12.42]Yeah, I'll show you.
[133:13.70]Just hold on.
[133:18.10]This is tough.
[133:18.50]I don't want to lose this.
[133:27.07]There's a lot of opportunity for me to lose.
[133:28.33]And I don't want it right now.
[133:29.27]Not this Narno.
[133:38.15]Oh!
[133:38.81]Yes!
[133:40.95]Was this a bonus room?
[133:41.93]I don't know.
[133:45.37]I'll show you after.
[133:46.31]Before I turn the stream off, I'll show you.
[133:52.84]What level is this one?
[133:53.56]Alright, I'm gonna sneak it up underneath.
[133:56.14]No.
[133:56.40]There we go.
[133:59.36]Get stuck.
[134:00.44]Get stuck.
[134:02.06]Get stuck.
[134:03.54]Get stuck.
[134:07.89]Get in there.
[134:08.51]Get stuck.
[134:14.11]Show us... I got... You mentioned the cake thing.
[134:18.70]Oh, that instantly kills me.
[134:20.12]I just lost two lives.
[134:20.98]I got a great portrait of Cake Mario.
[134:25.38]It's going up.
[134:26.18]I'm gonna hang on to the magic.
[134:40.05]In fact, actually, is it Cake Mario, though?
[134:42.55]Further inspection.
[134:43.39]I'll look at it in a minute.
[134:49.51]I think it's Cake Mario.
[135:03.88]Chat doesn't know?
[135:04.64]A lot of new viewers?
[135:05.98]Oh.
[135:06.06]Well, whatever.
[135:07.78]It's just Cake Mario.
[135:14.72]Alright, this guy's gonna die.
[135:19.98]Get it.
[135:21.38]Get it.
[135:30.89]Die.
[135:31.41]What?
[135:33.17]That hit him right in the back.
[135:44.35]How did I let the... I was going to say, I ain't fucking around anymore.
[136:00.16]Have I played Noita?
[136:01.64]No.
[136:03.02]I have not.
[136:09.53]Jesus oh alright nine left play it right now I'm about to beat this breakout game
[136:35.85]You say Noito?
[136:37.14]How do you say it?
[136:38.44]Noito?
[136:39.64]Noito?
[136:41.32]Noito?
[136:54.81]Shit!
[136:56.33]That was bad.
[136:56.79]Alright, there can't be many more levels after this.
[137:00.03]Hopefully I don't blow it.
[137:02.57]He's not going to ever play in Noito.
[137:03.57]Noito?
[137:06.20]Um, I don't know.
[137:08.90]We got a lot of stuff to do.
[137:11.55]And I also have seven streams that are not video games.
[137:20.67]That might be fun.
[137:25.60]That's right, you heard that right.
[137:26.76]Seven.
[137:31.70]Seven.
[137:33.67]Ugh!
[137:38.13]Did you give up on FTK?
[137:39.45]No, actually.
[137:40.11]I have a meeting with the people that made it.
[137:43.06]Because now I believe it is pretty close to being really, truly ready.
[137:47.16]And that test that we did a few weeks back was very, very, very helpful.
[137:54.11]Yeah, I have a meeting with those guys on... I think on Monday.
[138:01.29]You'll hear more about that soon.
[138:06.30]They all unlock the puzzle card game.

[140:06.04]Wait, what?
[140:06.46]Talk to her in the town.
[140:21.57]Oh.
[140:23.35]Demons could have used our magic to open a breach to the Netherworld.
[140:31.07]Uh That's one fourth of the game is it though, where's the other where are the other children?
[140:54.44]Are they hidden they might be hidden in other levels I'm telling you simple living is the best lifestyle

[141:06.93]Wait, what?
[141:14.09]There's 60 levels?
[141:16.31]Across the five worlds?
[141:17.85]Wait, so I have to find the way to get in?
[141:33.25]Wait, didn't I go in this thing's mouth?
[141:37.25]I'm confused.

[141:53.23]Yeah, I'm gonna clear this level.
[141:54.67]Fuck.
[141:56.97]There's only five lives, too.
[141:59.79]Shit, I'm in trouble.
[142:04.97]I should have bought lives.
[142:05.79]That was a mistake.
[142:12.40]How the fuck did I miss all those?
[142:13.98]I'm so sad.
[142:14.58]Alright, come on.
[142:31.29]But yeah, after tomorrow...
[142:33.89]I'm not sure what we're doing after that.
[142:38.31]There's a ton of things on this list.
[142:40.49]We'll just pick one.
[142:42.05]Got a lot of things to stream.
[142:47.89]Alright, I don't want to get accidentally put in there.
[142:55.87]Katana 0?
[142:56.65]I'm gonna play Katana 0.
[142:59.89]Maybe that's what we'll do after playing Keep Talking Nobody Explodes.
[143:05.77]possible next day or the day after whatever it's on the list I would show you the list but I don't want to spoil everything oh my god dude I forgot that I played that police game
[143:36.51]That game is weird.
[143:39.01]I completely forgot about that game.
[143:41.03]That was like yesterday in my brain.
[143:53.24]Okay.
[143:54.65]There it is.
[144:02.05]Is Pikmin on that list?

[147:25.96]I don't know if we're going to get them all.
[147:30.99]Well, we're going up here.
[147:33.95]Ooh, this will be interesting.
[147:36.91]Three orbs, double power.
[147:41.18]And catch them all.
[147:43.84]Let's go.
[147:52.37]It's just a shotgun that I get to catch.
[147:53.91]Fuck!
[147:56.15]What?
[147:56.49]How?
[147:57.65]How?
[147:58.37]I'm done playing the game.
[147:59.83]That just made me so sad.
[148:00.95]Like, that actually made me so sad.
[148:02.29]I can't believe it.
[148:06.36]That's actually ridiculous.
[148:08.24]I can't believe I fucked that up.
[148:16.60]Is this gonna go down?
[148:27.17]Damn it, I'm so... What the fuck?
[148:32.27]Alright, I'm in trouble.
[148:33.31]If I die, I'm... If I die, this is a cute game.
[148:37.57]This is a really cute game.
[148:39.39]I'm done with it, if it's cute.
[148:41.33]If it's a cute game, I'm done with it.
[148:45.20]Alright, I'm... Okay.
[148:47.46]I actually am, like, fucking starting to freak out.
[148:51.37]I just want a pizza.
[148:52.51]No, alright.
[148:53.21]I'm not going to be able to.
[148:53.85]Who cares?
[148:54.21]There's hearts in here.
[148:56.13]Don't even get the chest.
[148:57.59]What is going on right now, guys?
[148:59.49]What's going on?
[149:01.07]What am I doing?
[149:02.57]I just... I'm throwing.
[149:04.55]I'm not even trying to throw.
[149:05.69]I swear to god.
[149:26.04]You motherfucker.
[149:29.62]Yellow!
[149:34.79]Alright.
[149:41.19]Bart!
[149:41.97]Bart!
[149:43.91]Bart!
[149:47.58]Your mind says game but your heart says pizza.
[149:56.97]Or, like, maybe, like, tacos or something.
[149:58.56]Or, like, good, like, a good, nice, like, soft shell, you know what I mean?
[150:05.68]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[150:07.74]That's what I'm talking about.
[150:08.64]Get up there.
[150:24.51]Uh-oh.
[150:26.37]Alright.
[150:27.01]Pull it together here, seriously.
[150:28.05]Before I lose.
[150:30.51]Well, I got one child, right?
[150:32.51]So that's alright.
[150:37.90]Look, I need to get the four children of power!
[150:40.84]Alright, well with this I'll be able to at least turn on... Our TVs at least will work.
[150:46.04]Right?
[151:09.04]His brain is mush.
[151:25.37]Oh my god, I was looking at chat.
[151:27.55]Alright, it- yeah, alright.
[151:28.67]Okay, there it is.
[151:29.59]Alright, yup, yup, yup, yeah.
[151:31.35]Yup, yup.
[151:35.03]This game's actually really fun though.
[151:37.02]I like this game.
[151:42.42]He's done?
[151:43.06]No, I'm... Not yet.
[151:45.28]I'll get to one more boss.
[151:54.59]You said the same thing about Jump King?
[151:55.81]Yeah, but Jump King was... So you guys don't know this, but... Like two days ago, I had this extreme urge to play the DLC.
[152:08.48]I was like, I want to play Jumping DLC right now.
[152:09.90]And then I stopped myself.
[152:12.16]I was like, I don't want to do that.
[152:15.17]That does not sound like a good idea.
[152:16.29]Alright, this is it.
[152:23.52]No losing here.
[152:31.40]Get it up top.
[152:33.06]Nice, there it is.
[152:35.64]Go out again.
[152:36.68]Good, good, good, good, good.
[152:37.38]Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent.
[152:43.56]That's just exactly what I wanted to have happen.
[152:55.50]So there are two Jump King DLCs.
[152:57.12]I'm dead.
[153:02.87]No, we're good.
[153:03.25]We're good.
[153:03.47]I can do it again.
[153:19.34]The second one on average is between 25 and 40 hours.
[153:23.38]Yeah, I know.
[153:24.74]I've seen... I've seen a lot of the clips of streamers and falling...
[153:34.44]And I'm just like, that's probably gonna be me, and... It's just like, damn, that's a lot.
[153:44.61]Some of these people handle that shit way better than I would.
[154:00.92]Seriously.
[154:09.64]It takes an average of like 20 to 40 hours.
[154:16.56]Maybe.
[154:17.12]We'll see.
[154:18.32]I really know what's going to happen.
[154:20.04]I said this to myself.
[154:22.38]I'm going to open it.
[154:23.22]I'm going to be really into it.
[154:24.26]Yeah, let's go.
[154:24.80]I want to do the DLC.
[154:25.62]I'm going to get into it.
[154:26.18]I'm going to beat it.
[154:28.16]And after like two or three hours, I'm going to be sitting there.
[154:30.06]And you guys won't even hear about this.
[154:32.32]It'll be me internally saying to myself, not out loud, just going, what a fucking mistake this was.
[154:39.57]I could have fucking played Nancy Drew.
[154:41.31]Or anything.
[154:41.69]I could have played fucking No More Heroes or something.
[154:43.51]But now I'm here.
[154:45.93]Fucking idiot.
[154:46.47]Stupid fucking goddamn idiot.
[154:51.32]And now I can't leave.
[155:02.11]That would be internalizing that.
[155:11.86]Get him.
[155:12.24]How is it not getting him?
[155:25.50]Jump in real life instead.
[155:26.88]That would be interesting, wouldn't it?
[155:39.48]Play this game if you're a streamer or a YouTuber.
[155:44.01]I'm just happy that I beat it.
[155:46.85]And I... Look, if I never beat it again... If I never do anything... But I did the base game, and I'm like, okay.
[155:55.74]But if you start the DLC... You are accepting...
[156:02.80]the fact that you have to try to finish it.
[156:07.66]You don't start the Jump King DLC and go, man, alright, it's Jump King DLC!
[156:12.03]It's been an hour.
[156:12.99]No, I'm out.
[156:14.21]I'm not doing that.
[156:15.61]It's like you've... No, you have to stay there.
[156:25.09]You did it.
[156:25.59]You did that.
[156:28.01]Oh, I didn't.
[156:29.99]When did I do that?
[156:52.19]Oh, you tried out both DLCs.
[156:53.51]Yeah, but that was before even... One of those times is I just stumbled upon it accidentally.
[156:59.13]I thought it was another area in the game.
[157:00.95]I didn't know it was DLC.
[157:03.20]Yeah, of course, I wanted to see what it looked like.
[157:07.22]I didn't start playing the DLC.
[157:08.84]I just wanted to see what it looked like.
[157:27.93]Oh, you started it.
[157:30.17]I didn't even start it.
[157:39.81]I did, yeah, I did one screen.
[157:41.57]Come on, I'm playing a game that's relaxing, that's not Jump King.
[157:55.97]This stream has been kind of interesting.
[157:57.71]This was like... I was... That emergency game was crazy.
[158:03.36]And now I'm just, like, mouth open.
[158:05.10]It's pretty rare.
[158:15.51]We don't want you to relax.
[158:16.53]We want you to play Jump King.
[158:17.63]Don't relax.
[158:18.29]Stop relaxing.
[158:22.51]Fine.
[158:25.51]Fine, I'll open it.
[158:35.23]I'm not gonna beat it.
[158:37.52]No, no.
[158:38.78]Don't let him get to you.
[158:40.44]Don't let him feed on your vices and your insecurities.
[158:45.06]Don't let him.
[158:46.90]I don't want to open it.
[158:58.32]I'm not going to beat it tonight.
[159:03.17]I've been streaming for six hours.
[159:04.43]I'm not going to beat Jump King DLC tonight.
[159:09.13]You guys just told me it takes like 50 hours to beat this thing.
[159:12.12]I'm not going to beat it now.
[159:14.28]Me and Joel are playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes tomorrow.
[159:28.73]Fuck, I wanna play it right now.
