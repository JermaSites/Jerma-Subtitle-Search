[00:42.19]Hey.
[00:44.19]Welcome.
[00:46.43]Welcome.
[00:47.87]You've got mail.
[00:52.50]Remember that one?
[00:53.34]Remember AOL?
[00:54.58]Remember America on time?
[00:57.96]Remember America on time?
[00:58.90]Remember when America was actually on time?
[01:01.48]And they gave a shit about fucking everything?
[01:03.30]You know what I mean?
[01:04.47]I'm angry.
[01:05.35]Welcome.
[01:11.87]Yeah, we're three minutes early.
[01:17.27]90s reference.
[01:20.36]We start every stream these days with me talking shit about something or ranting about something.
[01:24.86]So we got a couple of things to talk about before we start streaming Gothic 1.
[01:27.50]So first of all, why do they serve drinks at the mall?
[01:36.48]They're like, you know, you go to like a mall, a big mall.
[01:39.84]There's a mall that's like very, very close.
[01:44.21]It's like maybe like, I don't know.
[01:46.51]There's a mall.
[01:47.21]Let's just put it this way.
[01:47.95]There's a mall that I go to sometimes that's like close enough.
[01:52.43]It's kind of a pain in the ass, but whatever.
[01:54.26]It's close enough.
[01:55.96]So, you have the bottom floor, and you've got a top floor, right?
[02:01.01]And on the top floor, people are walking around.
[02:02.77]It's open.
[02:03.59]There's just a railing that you can look over and look down and see all the fucking ant people, all the other ant human beings that you're at the mall with.
[02:11.55]So, I'm walking on the bottom floor, minding my own fucking business.
[02:15.80]Literally my own business.
[02:17.40]I didn't say anything to anybody.
[02:19.14]Didn't fucking talk shit to anybody.
[02:21.08]And what's that?
[02:21.66]What's that little trickle?
[02:22.82]I feel wetness on my head.
[02:24.77]Somebody fucking dumped a drink on my head at the ball today.
[02:28.35]And I get hit with this water and shit.
[02:32.10]And I'm like, what the fuck was that?
[02:33.62]I got rained on.
[02:35.58]And I look up, and this old motherfucker is sitting there hanging over the top railing.
[02:40.93]With this dirty, fucking soggy Coca-Cola cup in his hand.
[02:46.09]And I had this extreme...
[02:50.79]My brain hit a wall because this guy was an old fuck You know I mean this guy was like this guy had to be like 75 years old at least So what do I do?
[02:58.93]I was like I pointed my finger up and I put and I curled the finger back and I was like that guy's so old He doesn't even know he did that and like if I start screaming at an old guy I'm the bad guy you know I mean if I'm like hey you old fuck
[03:12.51]It's like, whoa!
[03:14.15]Hold on a second here, buddy.
[03:15.86]You gotta calm down.
[03:17.06]You can't yell at this old man.
[03:19.26]People just thought I was sweaty.
[03:23.00]But yeah, I got literally a drink that was fucking dumped on me today.
[03:27.52]And maybe I'm embellishing a little bit, but it was like, you know when you're outside in the rain, and you get hit with like 10 or 20 drops in a row, and you're like, what the fuck?
[03:35.13]Oh shit, it's raining, I think.
[03:36.87]It was like that.
[03:37.39]I got a fucking drink dumped on me.
[03:43.52]Good story.
[03:45.90]So anyways, we're gonna play Gothic.
[03:49.36]Gothic 1, the original Gothic.
[03:57.30]It's my favorite King of the Hill episode.
[03:58.84]I don't know.
[04:01.53]I don't know.
[04:03.57]First time ever not late.
[04:04.63]That's not true.
[04:06.95]But then another thing, like I found out this afternoon...
[04:10.12]And, like, I got a little shit for this on Twitter.
[04:14.48]I'm talking about, like, Call of Duty in, like, modern world.
[04:17.68]I made, like, three Call of Duty jokes.
[04:20.40]I mean, I was just, like, talking shit about Call of Duty and just hanging out in the mall getting drinks dumped on me.
[04:25.10]And, like, apparently, like, apparently I'm a psycho.
[04:29.00]And, like, I gotta stop, like, tweeting so much.
[04:32.28]Well, like, I had a little something to say about the Call of Duty.
[04:35.86]World War II is the only war ever fought.
[04:38.35]That's why we only make video games on World War II.
[04:41.45]Forget about, like, World War I or, like, the Civil War.
[04:44.69]Forget about, like, any... Forget about anywhere else that, like, didn't have anything to do with, like, an allied country.
[04:48.64]Like, you know, we just... Only World War II exists.
[04:54.34]You know, I better just delete my Twitter account.
[04:59.08]Historically accurate.
[05:00.54]No dude.
[05:01.22]Do you guys know what they did?
[05:02.32]This is fucking crazy?
[05:04.06]How is like nobody talking about this?
[05:07.16]Like am I am I are people talking about this am I insane have I lost my mind Or is everybody a made-up person are you guys all part of my imagination?
[05:16.26]Call the new Call of Duty is introducing a mechanic where if you watch people open loot boxes you get prizes and
[05:26.14]Like, you get loot boxes.
[05:27.88]I'm, I'm, I'm, look, this is complete speculation, because I don't know.
[05:31.49]You get prizes for watching other people open prizes.
[05:37.11]What?
[05:38.99]Oh, it's like, you're going around in a giant, like, fucking endless mirror.
[05:42.68]So you're gonna, like, watch your friend open a box, and then you open a box that he watches, and then you watch a streamer stream himself opening boxes while, like...
[05:50.79]What the fuck is going on right now?
[05:52.35]Like, have we really gone that far?
[05:54.61]Where, like, you're gonna play, you're gonna log into Call of Duty to watch somebody open boxes so then you get a free box?
[06:00.51]Yeah.
[06:01.73]Get rid of the boxes.
[06:02.87]Like, I don't, I don't, look, look, no, no, I don't mind loot boxes.
[06:05.93]I don't care about loot boxes.
[06:07.52]I've bought them before.
[06:08.40]I've opened them before.
[06:09.20]It can be fun sometimes.
[06:10.90]But, like, adding that extra layer of, like, watching someone open boxes for you to get boxes?
[06:17.82]I don't know.
[06:18.44]That's, that's where we get a little weird for me.
[06:21.84]Anyways, let's play Gothic.
[06:27.79]Everything seems to be in working order.
[06:30.03]Make sure I get this here.
[06:31.05]I do.
[06:31.59]Okay.
[06:33.27]Never played this game.
[06:34.99]Complain stream.
[06:35.69]No, I just like... Sometimes you gotta talk shit.
[06:38.73]It's true.
[06:41.23]It's true.
[06:42.89]Okay, here we go.
[06:43.99]How do I look?
[06:45.33]How do I look?
[06:47.03]New game.
[06:47.43]I don't know.
[06:48.07]This is probably gonna be loud.
[06:52.95]Buy some gothic loot boxes.
[07:00.64]Windows!
[07:02.18]Windows update!
[07:03.96]Windows update is fucking taking over the computer.
[07:06.80]I can't control this.
[07:09.33]It says newest feature of Windows is here.
[07:11.17]How do I get rid of this shit?
[07:14.84]Get off my screen.
[07:17.97]I can't do anything.
[07:19.65]Can you guys see this shit?
[07:20.51]Is it on your screen?
[07:22.01]I can't even tell.
[07:26.41]What the fuck?
[07:27.03]I can't move my mouse.
[07:31.77]I can't move my mouse.
[07:34.31]What the fuck?
[07:42.76]The newest feat.
[07:43.70]We can't even see the fucking cutscene.
[07:47.88]The war against the orcs took its toll.
[07:51.22]And the prisoners of the realm were to pay the price.
[07:55.10]We have to rewatch this cutscene because that looks like it could have been funny.
[07:57.40]I don't even know.
[07:57.98]The king needed swords for his army.
[08:01.30]And every man guilty of a crime.
[08:06.69]I keep... Fucking get off my screen.
[08:08.09]Hold on.
[08:09.07]God damn it.
[08:09.37]This piece of shit.
[08:09.91]I don't... Stop it!
[08:42.45]I think I can tell it to fuck off now.
[08:44.49]Pick a time, snooze.
[08:46.50]Snooze.
[08:48.34]The newest feature of Windows is here.
[08:49.68]Restart now, pick a time to do it, or snooze.
[08:54.00]Why are they treating fucking Windows updates like an alarm clock?
[08:57.42]Get out of here.
[08:57.96]Pick a time.
[08:58.50]Hey, how does fucking never sound?
[09:02.41]Off.
[09:06.03]Jesus fucking Christ.
[09:09.79]Alright.
[09:10.43]I think we're okay here.
[09:12.88]Am I back in the game?
[09:13.60]I am, all right.
[09:16.20]Okay, what do I need to know about this place?
[09:18.70]We call it the colony.
[09:20.44]You'll know already that we produce ore for the king.
[09:23.51]Well, at least we do in the old camp.
[09:25.93]This is pretty loud.
[09:26.59]There are three camps within the barrier.
[09:28.99]Three camps.
[09:29.43]The old camp is the biggest, and it was the first.
[09:32.69]This guy's bow is... What happened to this?
[09:37.40]Huh?
[09:38.20]Okay, good.
[09:43.31]The game already broke.
[09:55.84]I didn't do anything.
[09:56.62]I can't even hit escape.
[10:01.20]Fucking Windows update, man.
[10:02.48]Every stream, I swear to God, something happens.
[10:07.33]It took over the stream.
[10:09.41]Oh, God damn it, man.
[10:11.29]Whoa, wait, wait, hold on.
[10:14.52]Okay, if I press tab, I can get my life back together.

[10:56.50]I just picked up something off the ground.
[10:59.30]Alright, we have to restart the game.
[11:07.34]There's no way this is not gonna get restarted.
[11:09.44]It's all fucked up.
[11:13.24]We gotta fucking just redo it.
[11:19.13]Gothic 2.
[11:20.64]Let's move on to Gothic 2, guys.
[11:24.34]No, we gotta at least get out of the water.
[11:31.16]I can't exit the game.
[11:33.24]I blame Windows Update, man.
[11:34.54]I really do.
[11:35.06]I can't exit the game.
[11:40.61]Holy shit.

[13:22.96]I can't turn it down either.
[13:23.84]United by King Robar II.
[13:32.60]During the long years of his reign, he was able to defeat all foes of his realm.
[13:38.26]Doesn't it look like you're looking through a tunnel?
[13:39.54]No, you're in a movie theater.
[13:40.62]Hey, this is authentic.
[13:41.46]All except one.
[13:43.11]You guys are in a movie theater right now, and you're sitting, like, far back.
[13:47.21]It's a fucking movie theater mode.
[13:48.73]Just everybody shut up.
[13:54.20]That's sick.
[14:02.14]No talking at the movie.
[14:06.86]The war against the orcs took its toll.
[14:09.61]And the prisoners of the realm were to pay the price.
[14:13.43]How far back are we sitting?
[14:14.41]There's like 30,000 people in this theater.
[14:16.95]The king needed swords for his army.
[14:20.33]And every man guilty of a crime
[14:23.36]How insignificant was forced to work in the ore mines of Khorinis.
[14:29.76]To make it impossible for them to escape, the king sent out the best magicians of the kingdom to create a magic barrier around the entire valley.
[14:40.45]I was one of them.
[14:41.81]Something disturbed the delicate structure of magic.
[14:49.83]I can't believe that.
[14:50.55]That was a pretty sick firework.
[14:52.96]That was a firework filter.
[14:55.08]They bought that particle effect from some particle effect vendor.
[15:01.63]Khorinis was now under the control
[15:13.90]This is like a smart beer.
[15:15.52]Month after month, the king supplied everything the prisoners needed.
[15:18.91]Month after month, they brought the ore to the edge of the barrier in exchange.
[15:36.57]As me in the name of King robot the second in the name of chef boy idea of Verant I Sentence 2200 ravioli ingestion convict.
[15:46.91]I've got an offer to make you this letter must reach the leader of the magicians of fire Okay, you're wasting your time.
[15:53.82]You may choose your own reward They'll give you anything you ask for okay?
[15:59.58]My freedom very well.
[16:01.34]I'll take your letter I
[16:04.70]on one condition.
[16:06.02]He would kind of spare me the rest of his nonsense.
[16:08.64]How dare you?
[16:09.24]Keep silent.
[16:10.83]Right.
[16:11.41]Send him in.
[16:11.93]He just slit his hand.
[16:16.89]It's just Dark Messiah again, people screaming.
[16:22.96]Welcome to the colony.
[16:27.68]That's enough.
[16:28.68]Leave him alone.
[16:29.85]And now scram.
[16:31.15]I love this game already.
[16:33.41]It's me, your mentor.
[16:37.23]And this is where the game starts.
[16:38.39]Here we go.
[16:39.63]I'm Diego.
[16:40.57]Hello, Diego.
[16:41.25]I'm... I'm not interested in who you are.
[16:44.41]You've just arrived.
[16:46.11]I look after the new arrivals.
[16:48.23]That's all for now.
[16:49.61]If you plan to stay alive for a while, you should talk to me.
[16:53.24]But of course, I won't keep you from choosing your own destruction.
[16:56.37]Hmm.
[16:57.07]Well, what do you think?
[16:58.49]Okay.
[17:00.15]Okay, what do I need to know about this place?
[17:01.85]Why did you help me?
[17:02.80]I have a letter for the High Magician of the Circle of Fire.
[17:08.04]I have a letter for the High Magician of the Circle of Fire.
[17:10.74]Really?
[17:12.04]I was given it by a mage shortly before they threw me in here.
[17:15.35]You're lucky I can't afford to show my face around the mages anymore.
[17:19.47]Anyone else would gladly slit your throat for that letter.
[17:22.93]That's because the mages pay their couriers a lot.
[17:25.65]And most people here don't have anything.
[17:28.48]If I were you, I'd shut up until I met one of the mages.
[17:32.00]I feel like he was talking to me.
[17:32.86]Although in your situation, that's not likely to happen.
[17:35.50]Get out of the water.
[17:36.08]Why not?
[17:37.02]The mages are in the castle in the old camp.
[17:40.03]Only Gomez's people are allowed to enter the castle.
[17:43.89]Not bad.
[17:44.33]Okay, what do I need to know about this place?
[17:47.17]Who's Gomez?
[17:47.91]Let's assume I want to join his people.
[17:49.35]What do I do?
[17:50.60]Why did you help me?
[17:51.42]Alright, let's assume I want to...
[17:54.92]What do I need to know about this place?
[17:56.02]Shut up!
[17:56.48]Yeah, that boat is like going through his body.
[17:57.73]That boat is way too big.
[17:58.63]How do you shoot that boat?
[18:17.79]Does this guy lie down and, like, curl his legs back and shoot himself with the bow?
[18:22.96]That's the only way that bow is possible to use.
[18:26.02]Somebody has to, like, four guys have to hold this guy and, like, slingshot catapult him with that bow.
[18:32.17]That's not a bow for... That's a person bow.
[18:36.19]Let's assume I... How do I get to the old camp?
[18:38.82]How do I get to the old camp?
[18:40.76]You just follow this path.
[18:42.92]The old camp is the next reasonably safe looking place you'll come across.
[18:48.25]That wasn't even a joke.
[18:49.91]That wasn't a joke.
[18:52.05]That was me observing how big the bow was.
[18:54.29]Everybody get out of town.
[18:56.11]I got a drink dumped on me today.
[18:58.09]I get at least a little credit.
[19:01.55]Where do I get up the fucking newest version of Windows update is now available fuck off now fuck off pick it up I Swear to fucking god Where do I get a weapon when you get to the old mine have a look around?

[19:27.84]I said I'm gonna pick a time, and now I'm just perpetually picking a time.
[19:32.64]And I didn't even hear what he said, because fucking stupid blue windows.
[19:35.95]Oh, man.
[19:42.17]Why did you help me?
[19:43.45]Because you needed help.
[19:45.13]Otherwise, Bullet and his boys might have killed you.
[19:48.05]And I couldn't just stand by and watch.
[19:50.63]Because I came all this way to make a suggestion.
[19:53.49]A suggestion?
[19:54.41]Yes.
[19:55.47]After this little incident with Bullet and his guys, you should be aware now that you need protection.
[20:01.33]Everyone who arrives here has a choice.
[20:03.62]There are three camps in the colony.
[20:06.26]You'll have to join one of them.

[22:20.61]I don't have any weapons.
[22:21.41]So this is jump.
[22:27.07]Cool.
[22:27.53]Okay, so left control is action.
[22:30.57]Doesn't seem to do anything.
[22:33.58]Can I pick that up?
[22:36.06]I can't pick up the blueberries, I guess.
[22:39.64]Oh, I got, like, a karate kick.
[22:42.36]Sick.
[22:42.74]Alright, nice.
[22:43.70]So, I guess you have to go into, like, action mode and then, like, karate kick.
[22:48.49]What kind of fucking game has, like, a karate kick as the default attack?
[22:54.25]Can I kick this guy?
[22:55.13]Oh!
[23:03.18]Okay, yeah, I don't want to push my luck here.
[23:09.05]I guess the mouse, I can move the mouse, but it doesn't really do very much.
[23:14.89]There's like weird gray chocobos, alright.
[23:21.67]Oh, a sword!
[23:22.17]There's a sword, right.
[23:22.83]What kind of sword is sitting in the ground here?
[23:24.29]Alright, pick this up.
[23:29.67]How do I get that?
[23:30.31]Old sword.
[23:35.36]What's like the pick up weapon button?
[23:38.75]Keyboard.
[23:39.13]Okay.
[23:40.33]Action.
[23:40.69]Left control.
[23:42.95]Tab or backspace?
[23:44.25]Left control is action.
[23:45.67]Alright.
[23:52.80]That doesn't seem to do anything.
[23:59.48]Control and... Do I have to look at it?
[24:07.28]I very clearly have to pick this sword up, so we're gonna have to figure this out.
[24:11.04]No, don't do the stupid karate move.
[24:15.94]G?
[24:17.09]It's G. It's not G. Control up.
[24:25.49]Well, that's very fucking specific.
[24:27.03]Okay.
[24:27.53]Well, I have a weapon now.
[24:30.50]Uh, there it is.
[24:33.64]Where did it go?
[24:34.06]Okay.
[24:34.70]Okay.
[24:36.84]How do I equip this fucking thing?
[24:40.26]Old sword.
[24:41.86]Value.
[24:42.30]Okay, equip it.
[24:50.86]Got it.
[24:52.26]Nice.
[24:52.78]First weapon of the game.
[24:59.20]This is an old sword.
[25:00.05]Left control is swing.
[25:05.46]I think you have to be moving to swing the sword.
[25:08.94]That's block.
[25:10.34]That's swing.
[25:11.26]Alright, let's go.
[25:12.84]Is this the camp, right?
[25:14.78]Does the sword bark?
[25:16.88]So up in control, you put the sword away and that's how you pick shit up.
[25:21.23]Got it.
[25:22.95]Orc leaf.
[25:28.25]That seems odd.
[25:29.25]I should rebind it.
[25:30.01]Yeah, I might in a minute.
[25:33.07]There's no sprint.
[25:33.77]You just automatically are sprinting.
[25:35.09]Let's get these radishes.
[25:38.87]I kinda lost control of where that guy was.
[25:41.10]Remember, you gotta give this game a little credit here, guys.
[25:46.78]This is old.
[25:48.52]This game came out in 2001.
[25:52.24]Get some guys up here.
[25:53.04]I don't know if they're hostile.
[25:56.31]They look friendly enough.
[25:58.44]How do I talk?
[25:58.76]Uh-huh.
[25:58.90]Just kick them.
[26:15.68]There are different areas in this colony which are all more or less dangerous.
[26:20.38]The paths between the camps are quite safe, but even there you might come across some wolves which look on you as easy prey.
[26:27.82]Why am I not kicking people off the cliffs?
[26:29.16]And that's exactly what you are until you get a proper weapon and armor.
[26:32.68]Well, I do have a weapon.
[26:34.94]Where can I get better stuff?
[26:37.02]Where can I get better equipment?
[26:38.94]The nearest place is that old camp.
[26:41.42]Just follow the path that brought you here.
[26:43.38]Just gonna follow the path.
[26:44.14]You can get the stuff cheaper in our new camp, provided you know the right people.
[26:48.68]If you go to the old camp, ask for more training.
[26:50.80]Why is this place so dangerous?
[26:51.70]It's not.
[26:52.00]He's one of us.
[26:53.58]For just a little ore, he'll sell you the proper goods.
[26:59.20]Okay, thanks for your help.
[27:02.17]Thank you.
[27:02.69]Let's save this game again.
[27:11.02]Put the damn weapon away.
[27:12.80]That was a different voice actor.
[27:14.10]Okay.
[27:14.56]That was lucky.
[27:16.66]So these guys actually react if you pull out a weapon.
[27:18.68]I found somebody.
[27:19.44]You're in trouble.
[27:20.40]That's how it goes.
[27:21.90]How do I sneak?
[27:25.64]Same old story.
[27:27.06]Every time.
[27:29.06]Put the weapon away.
[27:30.96]That was lucky.
[27:33.06]Put the weapon.
[27:34.96]Lucky for you.
[27:35.66]I'm going to fuck it around.
[27:36.76]Let's go.
[27:38.44]Put it back in the holster.
[27:40.36]That was just a fucking... What are these chicken noises?
[27:56.67]Oh my god, this game is fucking so... I love it.
[28:04.33]Howdy.
[28:06.62]Put the damn weapon away!
[28:08.28]So you can't have weapons out.
[28:09.42]That was lucky.
[28:11.34]If you take a weapon out, people get very angry with you.
[28:13.18]Well, let's just go to the cave.
[28:13.94]Let's, like, progress the game.
[28:20.77]I'm gonna do this jump the whole way there.
[28:24.33]What the fuck are those?
[28:29.71]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:31.32]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[28:35.74]Oh, shit.
[28:38.90]How does this work?
[28:46.82]The whole camp is after me now.
[28:49.55]Put it away and run.
[28:53.51]I'm bleeding right now.
[28:55.31]Do I need to get bandaged?
[28:57.43]What the fuck was that?
[29:01.15]The bird is attacking me now.
[29:03.12]What's with all this danger?
[29:09.71]Save the game?
[29:10.31]I'm bleeding out.
[29:11.01]Why would I want to save the game?
[29:14.84]God damn it.
[29:17.86]Which way do I go?
[29:19.66]I don't know which way to go.
[29:22.82]Is the camp this thing on the left?
[29:42.57]It's such a cartoon scream.
[29:55.10]Alright, well let's go.
[29:57.16]I ain't done.
[30:00.63]Windows update.
[30:01.91]Was that the death sound of the character?
[30:03.31]That's what it sounded like.
[30:05.67]That was my death animation and my death sound.
[30:10.04]Oh, imagine.
[30:11.12]That would be so funny.
[30:12.85]Alright, so here's the camp.
[30:13.79]Obviously this is the camp.
[30:14.67]Alright, protect me.
[30:17.23]Protect me, men of the honor guard.
[30:19.93]Let me... Let me pass.
[30:24.19]Just walk around me.
[30:27.25]Walk around me.
[30:29.25]There's so much... Let me pass.
[30:31.09]Are you talking to me or are you talking to him?
[30:34.03]Because you're blocking him and I'm blocking him.
[30:37.59]Who's...
[30:40.52]let me pass my god you both so dumb now I pick this thing up have you got any advice for me yeah don't go in the forest on your own okay unless you're strong enough to fight off all the beasts okay sure okay bye make sure you get to the old camp they're holding a pickaxe for you
[31:10.42]Alright, what the fuck is that?
[31:13.99]Why did they turn into like an old country prospector?
[31:17.25]Oh, they're holding a little thing for you.
[31:18.95]Alright.
[31:25.13]I need proper armor.
[31:26.07]We gotta go talk to our friend in here.
[31:28.74]We have to say Diego sent us, right?
[31:31.68]And that gets us all the free shit.
[31:34.94]Save the game, just in case.
[31:36.36]You know, back in the day, back in like the fucking 2000s,
[31:39.95]You could actually save scum, and it was perfect.
[31:42.01]It was great.
[31:42.47]Everything worked good.
[31:43.47]Where do you think you're going?
[31:45.42]To the camp.
[31:46.50]You ain't come to make trouble, have you?
[31:49.00]No.
[31:49.92]Diego says I'm to meet him in the camp.
[31:51.24]I just want to take a look around.
[31:52.22]Sure, I plan on to take the whole camp on.
[31:55.14]Sure.
[31:55.74]I plan to take on the whole camp.
[31:57.58]Hey, this guy's funny.
[32:00.23]I don't like funny guys.
[32:01.73]Sure, I I'm here to take the whole camp on.
[32:06.21]Well, you try that again, and you'll regret it.
[32:11.52]Is he robbing me?
[32:15.74]What the fuck happened?
[32:16.64]Wait, they just like almost killed me?
[32:19.35]How do I get up?
[32:21.45]I'm not dead.
[32:22.15]Oh, there we go.
[32:39.46]Try that again, and you'll regret it.
[32:42.78]He just tried to do this, and that didn't have anything to do with it.
[32:45.04]Shit!
[32:45.20]He hasn't even got any ore on him!
[32:46.81]It's the same guy who tried to do the same thing.
[32:50.19]You already searched me, dude.
[32:54.63]Alright, get up.
[32:59.55]Shit, it didn't even have any ore on him.
[33:02.78]I can't believe it.
[33:07.22]Where do you think you're going?
[33:09.39]Yeah, I've actually came to take on the whole camp.
[33:15.38]Diego.
[33:16.02]Diego says I'm to meet him in the camp.
[33:18.20]Hey, train, thanks for the six bucks.
[33:21.34]Hey, German, watched you for a long time, and since you started playing, I can't... I can't read it, I'm sorry.
[33:27.17]If I alt-tab... I'm in deep shit if I alt-tab.
[33:35.84]What the fuck?
[33:37.94]What happened?
[33:40.26]I didn't... I just grabbed like... I grabbed the ship wheel and all of a sudden I can't do... Hey, how dare you grab my imaginary pirate ship wood.
[33:57.63]Get up.
[34:02.08]Apparently I can't touch anything.
[34:05.81]Fine.
[34:06.35]I'm just making... Hold on a minute.
[34:11.57]Where's the blood?
[34:12.53]Look at all this blood.
[34:13.97]I'm making a fucking mess.
[34:16.23]I'm making a fucking mess.
[34:33.55]My final words.
[34:33.95]I'll give you my last fucking will and testament.
[34:35.37]I'm gonna spell it out for you.
[34:53.53]I'm trying to write fucking cursive.
[34:58.21]Okay.
[34:58.45]Make a K quick before I die.
[34:59.93]There we go.
[35:00.75]Does it say...
[35:24.41]No, it doesn't.
[35:25.51]It doesn't say it.
[35:27.18]Oh, I wouldn't like to be on his shoes while I play with my iPad.
[35:31.92]Oh, no, it's cheese.
[35:34.32]Okay.
[35:36.50]How do I turn on the light?
[35:37.96]I want to start a fire.
[35:39.68]Where'd you get that cheese?
[35:42.94]Okay, let's forget about our little argument.
[35:48.95]Tell me how I can not bleed to death.
[35:50.79]Take care.
[35:52.96]Now where are you?
[35:53.76]There he is, Diego.
[35:57.68]Diego, I need to talk to you.
[36:04.46]Tell me more about the barrier.
[36:05.44]Tell me more about the barrier.
[36:07.40]There isn't much to tell.
[36:09.08]It's impenetrable.
[36:10.46]This is uncomfortable.
[36:10.92]What happens if I just walk out of here?
[36:13.06]The last one who tried that reached the other side a dead man.
[36:16.24]I don't know why you have to be this close.
[36:17.80]This damn barrier lets you in, but you'll never get out of here.
[36:22.19]If there's a way out, I'll find it.
[36:24.43]You're already in a rush to get out of here?
[36:26.69]But you've only just arrived.
[36:29.92]Okay.
[36:32.82]Tell me something about the old camp.
[36:34.90]It's the biggest and most powerful of the three camps.
[36:38.90]Gomez and his guys control the camp and thereby the whole ore trade.
[36:44.07]Once a month, the king sends us everything we need.
[36:47.31]We've got the old guy in our grip, you understand?
[36:51.07]He sends us wine, bread, meat, weapons, everything.
[36:55.52]You can also get some of it.
[36:57.44]All you have to do is join Gomez's people.
[36:59.94]All right, well, I'm just going to join it.
[37:01.24]Like, where is he?
[37:02.40]Like, let me talk to him.
[37:03.05]Who's Gomez?
[37:04.53]Gomez is the most powerful ore baron.
[37:07.19]He's the boss of the old camp.
[37:08.67]The most powerful man in the colony.
[37:10.53]Find him and make this work.
[37:13.24]Find Gomez.
[37:13.66]Take care.
[37:18.00]Am I still bleeding?
[37:19.84]I'm still just fucking bleeding everywhere.
[37:24.92]Where's Gomez?
[37:25.98]Gomez!
[37:26.92]No, there is Gomez.
[37:31.46]Hold on a minute.
[37:31.98]I need to eat this food.
[37:33.26]Can I steal this food from this guy or am I going to get attacked for this?
[37:35.56]Okay, he's cooking.
[37:35.92]He's cooking.
[37:36.18]Can we get away with this?
[37:38.06]We're going to hide in the water.
[37:50.46]I can't, like, steal the pan.
[37:51.65]Did he just spit that out and put it back in the pan?
[37:58.21]He did.
[38:02.52]This dude is just, like, continuously regurgitating this meat and throwing it in here.
[38:09.57]Come here, let me...
[38:12.34]How are you doing?
[38:13.70]Well since I stopped working in the mine I can't really complain.
[38:17.18]And where do you get your ore from?
[38:20.06]I help people who have problems.
[38:22.73]If you get into trouble with influential people here I can help you sort the thing out.
[38:27.89]Lots of weird positions here.
[38:35.15]belongs to the influential people here.
[38:37.43]You ought to impress the right people, do you?
[38:39.97]I do.
[38:40.53]Diego has the most power of all the shadows.
[38:42.87]Obviously, shut up.
[38:45.26]I don't care about you anymore.
[38:46.20]We've got to find Diego.
[38:48.78]And we have to become, like, popular.
[38:51.12]We have to be one of the popular kids.
[38:54.26]Where's his house?
[38:58.59]Diego probably has, like, the biggest, best house.
[39:00.25]Can I sleep in this guy's bed?
[39:03.43]Alright, we gotta sleep in the bed.
[39:07.43]Sleep.
[39:09.95]Sleep in this bed.
[39:11.61]You very clearly need to rest.
[39:13.01]Sleep in the bed.
[39:15.46]I can't sleep in the bed.
[39:16.82]Ooh, a chest.
[39:18.06]Open it.
[39:18.26]Why the fuck can I open this?
[39:20.78]No, don't!
[39:21.20]What do I...
[39:33.30]Skipping dialogue.
[39:34.44]Control up?
[39:34.98]That's what I was doing.
[39:35.77]He just did like the, I don't know.
[39:40.99]Nobody has this much blood.
[39:42.99]Oh, a tumbler.
[39:45.45]And a plate.
[39:47.47]Nice.
[39:50.94]I keep putting the sword... I guess I need like a key to open these chests.
[39:58.10]Control down?
[39:59.46]Control down is like a little step.
[40:01.06]It's a little like, whoopsie.
[40:04.29]Okay, uh, looking for Gomez.
[40:08.39]What is that noise?
[40:09.37]Is it about to start raining?
[40:13.91]What?
[40:16.37]Just follow the trail of blood, you'll find me.
[40:20.03]What is it?
[40:21.35]Who's trying to call me?
[40:22.11]This guy?
[40:22.93]What?
[40:23.17]What do you want?
[40:24.11]Uh...
[40:34.99]What do I have to do to get admitted?
[40:36.10]What do I have to do if I want to get admitted to this camp?
[40:39.40]Well, first of all, you have to become a shadow.
[40:42.60]Therefore, you have to find somebody who supports you, somebody who explains everything to you and takes responsibility for you.
[40:51.10]If I was you, I'd try to keep close to Diego.
[40:54.51]I did it like that.
[40:55.81]He's quite all right.
[40:57.11]He'll make you take the test of faith.
[40:59.49]That's different from everybody.
[41:01.59]If you manage them, you'll be with us.
[41:03.95]Cool.
[41:05.17]Okay.
[41:06.01]It was your faith.
[41:06.99]Why am I that nosy?
[41:08.96]I don't care.
[41:09.96]We're going to save.
[41:11.00]Save it.
[41:11.58]Diego, where is this guy?
[41:21.21]Take care.
[41:22.89]Okay.
[41:23.63]Where is this guy's house?
[41:25.34]He has to be over in a house somewhere, right?
[41:27.28]Gomez.
[41:29.88]Guard.
[41:30.34]Maybe up here?
[41:33.28]Hey, you!
[41:35.22]Are you talking to me?
[41:36.70]I'm warning you, people like you can get into trouble awfully quick around here.
[41:40.85]And most of the guys they chuck in here are bastards.
[41:45.43]They think they can do what they like to you, but we won't allow that.
[41:49.63]Gomez wants some peace in the camp, and we guards make sure he gets it.
[41:53.69]But it's a job that doesn't come cheap.
[41:56.36]That's why I'm asking you for some ore.
[41:58.82]Look on it as a kind of token of friendship.
[42:00.82]Oh, come on.
[42:01.04]Don't make me go get ore.
[42:01.68]You help us, and we'll help you.
[42:03.66]If you get in trouble, we'll be there for you.
[42:05.84]Okay.
[42:07.46]Is that a threat?
[42:08.15]You want me to pay protection money?
[42:10.19]Why not?
[42:10.61]How much ore do you want?
[42:11.87]Why not?
[42:12.77]How much ore were you thinking of?
[42:15.19]Not much.
[42:15.87]Ten ore, that's all I need.
[42:17.25]Ten ore?! !
[42:18.70]That's like 50,000 in old medieval times.
[42:21.30]I don't have tenor.
[42:22.36]I don't have tenor.
[42:24.14]Then I'll take whatever you have.
[42:25.84]That's okay.
[42:26.62]I have zero.
[42:27.10]You can give me the rest next time I see you.
[42:30.78]Let me see.
[42:32.15]Zero.
[42:32.77]You really are broke, aren't you?
[42:34.87]Well, I guess there's always next time.
[42:37.11]Okay, so thanks.
[42:39.61]See you.
[42:39.91]I appreciate it.
[42:40.53]Don't you worry about anything here in the camp.
[42:42.89]We'll be looking out for you.
[42:45.88]Mate, I pass through here.
[42:49.09]All right, well, that guy was all talk.
[42:53.13]Hey, lookit.
[42:53.85]All right, nice.
[42:54.45]That guy's smoking a joint, by the way.
[42:57.07]What is that?
[42:59.81]I need to talk to these guys.
[43:02.21]All of this is cheese and weed and blood.
[43:04.62]Could I interest you in a transfusion?
[43:10.55]What's up?
[43:10.89]What are the most important places?
[43:12.07]Who's the boss?
[43:12.75]How can I join this camp?
[43:13.80]Where can I find?
[43:15.36]What's up?
[43:16.18]What's up?
[43:17.38]You'll learn soon enough.
[43:19.06]Be on your guard at all times.
[43:21.78]I haven't slept properly for days.
[43:23.98]If you don't sleep in this colony, then you're doing double time.
[43:27.94]Oh, dude, you never drop the joint, dude.
[43:29.72]That's a fucking party foul.
[43:31.91]Thank God he had an extra one in his cartoon jacket.
[43:38.97]What about this guy?
[43:39.69]I want to talk to this guy.
[43:47.79]I want to talk to this guy.
[43:50.04]Here we go.
[43:51.30]I'm new here.
[43:51.76]Who are you?
[43:52.62]I'm new here.
[43:53.54]Who are you?
[43:54.96]I am Baal Taran of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper.
[43:58.68]Of course the guy that smokes all the weed is the Sleeper.
[44:02.42]Get me in the castle.
[44:03.04]I need to get into the castle.
[44:04.42]Can you help me?
[44:05.61]I fear I cannot, brother.
[44:07.95]The only ones among us who may enter the castle are those who supply the weed to Gomez.
[44:13.39]Are you fucking serious?
[44:14.23]We gather swamp weed and sell part of it to the old camp in exchange for goods from the outside world.
[44:20.22]That actually is weed.
[44:21.44]If you were one of the couriers working for Cor Calum, you could get into the castle.
[44:27.42]But for that, you would need to be one of us.
[44:30.08]Are you serious?
[44:30.88]What do you want to do in the castle anyway?
[44:33.10]Okay.
[44:34.96]I have a letter for this guy.
[44:36.88]I have a letter for the High Magician.
[44:38.38]He's part of the Weed Empire.
[44:40.17]Oh.
[44:41.27]And where did you get that from?
[44:43.41]The mages gave you that before they threw you in here, right?
[44:45.85]This game's fucking awesome.
[44:46.53]That guy's eating a brick.
[44:47.21]That guy just ate a fucking brick.
[44:53.50]But do yourself a favor and don't tell anybody else about it either.
[44:58.36]The people here might slit anybody's throat for a thing like that.
[45:02.64]Most people would love to earn the reward you get for a message from the outside world.
[45:10.18]What is the Brotherhood of the Sleeping?
[45:13.06]Okay.
[45:15.77]Who is the sleeper?
[45:16.96]Who is the sleeper?
[45:17.96]The sleeper is our redeemer.
[45:20.84]He disclosed himself five years ago through E-Barian.
[45:25.52]Since then, we have renounced the three gods.
[45:29.72]The gods just stood by and watched while we were exiled to this prison.
[45:35.20]But the sleeper will lead us to freedom.
[45:39.12]Okay, well, how does your god prove his might?
[45:40.48]What will the way to freedom look like?
[45:41.84]I need to get into the castle.
[45:42.94]All right, I'm joining this guy.
[45:45.12]What will the way to freedom look like?
[45:46.82]We are preparing a great invocation of the sleeper, in which all novices create the contact to... In this invocation, the sleeper will reveal the path to freedom.
[46:00.39]Okay.
[46:02.37]Sure.
[46:05.93]Graham.
[46:07.81]Kettle.
[46:10.56]Uh, what is this guy?
[46:11.30]Graham.
[46:14.84]So let's, like, wrap around here and let's take a look at these guys.
[46:18.31]These guys are all, like, workers, I'm assuming, right?
[46:24.27]Well, I wonder what this guy's gonna do here.
[46:26.57]I'm a newcomer.
[46:27.13]You get a job.
[46:27.65]What is it?
[46:29.15]You have a job for me?
[46:30.75]What is it?
[46:36.98]One of our guards has disappeared.
[46:38.88]He's called Neck.
[46:40.60]He might have gone over to the new camp.
[46:42.75]You're new here, and you'll get around quite a lot, so keep your eyes peeled.
[46:47.19]If you find him, I'll speak up for you in the camp.
[46:49.91]I'm gonna go find Neck.
[46:52.37]I'll see if I can find him.
[46:53.39]I'll see if I can find him.
[46:55.28]If you meet Fletcher, ask him about Neck.
[46:57.84]He's taken over his district since Neck disappeared.
[47:01.14]Where will I find him?
[47:02.58]His district is the district of the arena.
[47:06.34]It was a very oddly written piece of dialogue.
[47:09.10]And let me see here.
[47:09.82]I got this... I still have this.
[47:13.21]Didn't I pick up like berries and shit?
[47:14.99]So I gotta go to the other camp?
[47:22.41]I gotta save this game.
[47:24.39]What the fuck is going on?
[47:25.62]Everyone be quiet.
[47:27.76]I'm scared that like, if something bad happens, then I can't have my save points in a bad spot.
[47:34.13]What is this guy gonna demand of me?
[47:35.66]Mate, I pass through!
[47:39.60]How often have I told you bastards not to run through my hut?
[47:44.11]What?
[47:44.63]What's your problem?
[47:46.43]Leave me alone, man.
[47:49.01]Everyone's a problem with me.
[47:51.01]It all started when I built my hut.
[47:53.21]Don't build your hut close to the ditch, they said.
[47:56.79]But none of these bastards told me what would happen if I still did it.
[48:00.66]When I came back from the mine a few days ago, I had a second door.
[48:04.82]This guy's voice.
[48:05.94]Jesus Christ.
[48:07.42]I can't tell you how much I hate him.
[48:09.66]Now everybody runs through my hut.
[48:12.52]Every idiot!
[48:14.76]Idiot!
[48:19.04]Alright, well, fuck you.
[48:22.84]Alright, this guy's eating bricks.
[48:28.13]So I need to, um... I need to, like... I need to go do, like, a mission.
[48:33.87]Do I have, like, a journal or anything?
[48:36.38]Current missions.
[48:37.10]Vanquished guard.
[48:38.64]Admission to the old camp.
[48:39.82]To be allowed to join Gomez people in the old, I need to see Thoros.
[48:45.08]Okay, we need to find Thoros?
[48:46.83]Where was that guy?
[48:47.45]We're looking for Thoros.
[48:53.08]Thoros, one of you guys.
[48:54.50]Shadow Jackal.
[48:56.89]Ah, new face.
[48:58.17]What do you want?
[48:59.23]I want to offer you help.
[49:00.95]You're new here, and the new ones always get into trouble.
[49:03.29]You can save yourself a lot by making a small donation.
[49:06.89]I don't have anything to do.
[49:08.73]Just ten ore, man.
[49:10.17]That ain't much to ask.
[49:11.11]Another ten ore.
[49:12.11]All right, sure.
[49:13.09]Here's ten ore, and you'll have to help me if I get in trouble.
[49:17.52]Here's 10 ore, and you'll have to help me if I get into trouble.
[49:20.16]Okay.
[49:20.90]Hey, watch who you're trying to fool.
[49:23.51]Come back when you have the ore.
[49:24.79]I want to kick this guy off the edge so bad.
[49:30.53]All right, well, I need to find Thoros, but who knows where the fuck that guy is.
[49:41.63]I thought that was going to kill me, but it didn't.
[49:45.13]The sleeper be with you, stranger.
[49:47.91]I'm here to guide you onto the right path.
[49:54.18]Which is the right path?
[49:55.96]The path of the sleeper.
[49:58.30]He alone has the power to set us free.
[50:01.02]The gurus are preparing a great invocation in our camp.
[50:05.79]So far, he's just talked to us in visions.
[50:08.91]But now, it's time to get in touch with him.
[50:12.39]We'll need as many supporters as possible for that.
[50:15.73]By focusing our spiritual power, we'll get through to him.
[50:20.01]Our camp is some distance away in the swamp.
[50:23.25]I can take you there, though, if you want.
[50:25.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
[50:27.34]Take me to the camp.
[50:28.04]I want to have a look at it.
[50:29.68]Yes.
[50:30.62]Take me to your camp.
[50:31.88]I want to have a look at it.
[50:33.78]Very good.
[50:34.82]I'll go ahead.
[50:35.98]Follow me.
[50:36.54]Let's do it.
[50:38.06]We've got a mission.
[50:41.93]This guy's a little faster than me, though.
[50:43.33]Okay, so save game.
[50:49.45]Uh... There.
[50:57.09]Okay.
[50:58.96]Let's go.
[50:59.46]I feel like this guy can protect me.
[51:00.50]We're gonna be fine.
[51:01.08]We're gonna get to his camp.
[51:05.74]No, get the fuck out of here.
[51:07.94]He's waiting for me.
[51:09.28]Show me your goods.
[51:09.92]Wait a minute.
[51:12.43]Oh, shit.
[51:13.59]Okay, what do we got?
[51:14.65]Okay, we got a handgun, dynamite, an egg sack, a kazoo, nothing, a tooth, essence of healing, a brick, a fake beard, an egg inside of a nest, and a fishing pole.
[51:35.98]Okay, which one do I want?
[51:39.61]What do I have?
[51:39.91]Where's my money?
[51:42.07]How much money do I have?
[51:47.02]Value 8.
[51:48.96]25.
[51:49.00]I need to heal.
[51:49.62]I don't know.
[51:55.56]Do I have, like, money anywhere?
[51:57.50]Where's my money?
[51:58.18]Well, I can sell this tumbler, right?
[52:03.95]Refuse, accept, refuse back.
[52:05.51]Wait, what's going on?
[52:08.45]Show me your goods.
[52:09.99]Choose something.
[52:13.72]Like... It's, like, cut off by the fucking window.
[52:18.40]I'm gonna buy a healing potion.
[52:20.48]Did I buy it?
[52:24.62]Show me your... Choose something.
[52:27.34]Apparently I can't afford it.
[52:28.32]So, like, I'm gonna go over here and, like, sell this.
[52:34.76]Show me your... Choose something.
[52:44.43]How do I, like, put something in... How do I, like, select something to put over here?
[52:52.76]Alt.
[52:54.50]I thought I tried that.
[52:55.52]Alright, so let's just say I want, like, a piece of bread, right?
[53:03.32]I can't... It doesn't do anything.
[53:04.82]Or you're, like, messy.
[53:11.08]Control doesn't do anything.
[53:14.56]Alt doesn't do anything.
[53:16.74]Space doesn't do anything.
[53:17.94]Ah.
[53:20.16]Ah.
[53:20.28]There we go.
[53:27.48]Okay, so you have to... Okay, I got it.
[53:28.96]So I'll give you a branch.
[53:34.22]Okay, I have a beard and I have three brains, a beard, and a plant.
[53:38.52]So you take that.
[53:40.70]And then...
[53:46.55]God, this is messy.
[53:49.17]Oh my God.
[53:50.72]Okay, so I want a piece of bread.
[54:02.45]Bread for one of my... Wait, this is way more expensive.
[54:09.16]Okay.
[54:12.08]I want to get back over to the left.
[54:13.39]There we go.
[54:14.67]Give me a healing potion.
[54:15.55]A healing potion and a brick.
[54:19.11]I'll give you a stick of dynamite, an egg sack, and I don't even know where my fucking cursor is.
[54:28.80]There we go.
[54:30.00]And I'll give you none of these.
[54:36.82]I'll give you a throw and a beer, too.
[54:39.14]How's that sound?
[54:46.90]Accepted.
[54:49.24]Okay, let's go.
[54:59.85]Apparently, I don't... I didn't do anything, apparently.
[55:04.10]And the screen is cut off to a point where I don't know where it is.
[55:17.95]No, that's a bad idea.
[55:20.85]Although I do... Hold on.
[55:22.23]Can I just use this shit?
[55:27.39]There we go.
[55:27.75]I just take the leap.
[55:30.23]Life bonus.
[55:30.77]Alright, am I back?
[55:32.31]I'm at full health now.
[55:36.11]Back here.
[55:37.43]And we're good.
[55:37.79]Let's go.
[55:38.65]I'm no longer bleeding.
[55:44.31]Do I have any community patches?
[55:45.83]No, I do not.
[55:47.63]I do not have any community patches for the game yet.
[55:50.81]I just was checking it out.
[55:55.42]Are we really going to walk by the fucking Resident Evil licker?
[56:00.22]You sure about this?
[56:03.54]Can you handle this?
[56:07.02]I'll help him.
[56:10.82]I just... I just hit him.
[56:16.38]Please don't be mad at me.
[56:18.02]He's not mad, right?
[56:20.25]Can I, like, skin him?
[56:21.55]Lizard?
[56:22.11]Can't do anything.
[56:24.75]There were some healing items over here, though.
[56:29.79]We did get some action.
[56:37.50]At least I'm picking items up.
[56:43.10]Watch out for the water.
[56:43.84]Don't fall in the water.
[56:44.52]I have to learn to skin.
[56:48.58]Oh, okay.
[56:50.06]Watch out for the wolf.
[56:58.85]I helped.
[57:00.61]Look, I helped.
[57:02.63]I sat out here like a child with my sword.
[57:04.85]Good job, buddy.
[57:10.15]Only stream Gothic from now on.
[57:12.53]Well, there are a shitload of them.
[57:13.69]There are like four or five of these games.
[57:18.15]I'm just leeching off this guy for XP.
[57:20.59]Bugs.
[57:30.12]Red blood.
[57:32.72]Come on, dude.
[57:33.28]I already got mine.
[57:33.90]You can't even handle a fucking bee?
[57:37.18]Get with the program, dude.
[57:41.16]Where's the rope bow?
[57:46.36]Looks like a weird Morrowind mod.
[57:52.23]Oh, here we go again.
[57:54.13]Oh, come on.
[57:59.93]What the fuck?
[58:02.53]Why?
[58:04.51]Did I just get triple tapped?
[58:07.76]Can he revive me?
[58:10.71]He's gonna revive me, right?
[58:22.25]Where's my friend?
[58:23.13]Oh my god, this game is fucking... This game is a harsh...
[58:37.22]I just got deci- No!
[58:39.24]Oh, and I didn't even eat my stupid plant.
[58:40.84]I don't even care.
[58:42.33]What do you want?
[58:42.83]No, yeah, I'm leaving, by the way.
[58:44.53]I'm only safe in the camp.
[58:45.35]Okay, thanks.
[58:45.67]I appreciate the- I appreciate the concern.
[58:46.83]But I gotta go.
[58:47.63]Let's eat the fucking plant again.
[59:10.02]Okay, let's move.
[59:11.20]This time I'm not gonna die.
[59:12.20]I'm not gonna mess around.
[59:22.17]Gothic is such an asshole.
[59:25.35]It really is.
[59:27.22]I want to just be like a magician or something.
[59:29.06]What if I get to learn magic?
[59:30.20]I don't want to get up there and fight.
[59:33.22]I just want to leech XP.
[59:35.48]I do have to like tag the monster, right?
[59:36.82]No, I don't.
[59:38.02]I don't have to do anything.
[59:38.88]This guy's got me covered.
[59:40.63]Put the weapon down!
[59:41.47]Are you fucking kidding me?
[59:44.59]We just fought together.
[59:45.57]What do you think you're doing?
[59:47.15]You want trouble with me?
[59:48.11]I don't want any trouble.
[59:49.13]You and I just left the camp together and a monster just attacked us.
[59:55.05]Try that again and you'll regret it.
[59:58.75]He's robbing me!
[60:01.11]No ore.
[60:02.23]Dammit!
[60:08.37]Just trying to make some friends.
[60:14.80]I just wanted some friends.
[60:15.92]Everybody's scared about ore.
[60:17.72]They're all addicted to fucking ore.
[60:20.22]What the hell did I do?
[60:21.34]I got betrayed.
[60:25.97]Of course, why would I trust the drug dealer?
[60:32.08]Hold on.
[60:37.16]I gotta like put this thing over here for a second.
[60:41.44]Don't do it.
[60:42.78]Don't do it, Windows.
[60:44.22]Okay, we're back.
[60:46.25]We're back.
[60:46.51]We're back.
[60:46.73]We're good.
[60:46.95]We're good.
[60:47.19]We're good.
[60:47.41]We're good.
[60:47.79]Okay.
[60:55.05]I assume the berries, they're just everywhere and you can just eat them, right?
[60:57.59]I would hope so.
[60:58.09]I would hope that's the case.
[61:00.55]Down here.
[61:01.13]Ore is a way of life.
[61:02.09]Look at all these mushrooms.
[61:05.49]This is bread?
[61:09.93]What's this called?
[61:10.89]Slave bread?
[61:12.18]It's a mushroom.
[61:13.20]I don't get it.
[61:16.26]This is just called a mushroom.
[61:22.28]Control up.
[61:23.06]Come on.
[61:23.28]I gotta get that down.
[61:25.47]Well, dude, I got, like, an actually, like, a pretty good idea.
[61:28.01]So, this guy is, like, an NPC, and he's really, really strong.
[61:31.69]So, why don't I just lure all these monsters over to him and get a bunch of free experience?
[61:37.16]If you don't think that's what we're doing, that's what we're doing.
[61:39.86]Now, let's eat this.
[61:40.66]Let's eat these.
[61:41.18]How much is a berry?
[61:42.04]Life bonus, 10, 15, 6.
[61:45.20]We'll just go with this first, and then one of these, and one more of those.
[61:49.95]Okay.
[61:51.43]Save the game.
[61:57.60]You do not want to play this game.
[61:59.48]Wait, why?
[62:01.32]What's wrong with this game?
[62:03.86]Now watch this.
[62:07.35]Easy fucking money.
[62:08.31]Wait, I gotta find that guy.
[62:09.77]That's the guy I had to find.
[62:10.59]Watch this.
[62:11.15]Come on.
[62:12.87]Bring him over to the NPC and get free experience.
[62:17.95]There he is.
[62:18.31]Alright, here we go.
[62:22.33]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:23.50]Come this way.
[62:26.60]Do they have an aggro leash?
[62:28.00]No, they don't.
[62:28.66]This game's from 2001.
[62:29.12]There's no such thing as an aggro leash.
[62:35.25]There's a guy lying down in there.
[62:38.87]Sooner or later, we're going to quit this and never finish it.
[62:42.25]I mean, that's like, you know, that might be true, but it's not 100% true.
[62:45.83]All right, come on, hungry, hungry hippos.
[62:51.34]Let's go.
[62:53.00]Run over here.
[62:54.94]Keep going.
[62:55.80]You're almost there.
[62:57.48]All right, go get them, Bale.
[63:00.65]Off the rock, though.
[63:01.63]Off the rock.
[63:03.29]Look at that, 50 experience.
[63:08.03]All right, dude, you have to come down.
[63:09.61]Easy.
[63:09.89]Don't hit me.
[63:11.40]Is he hitting me?
[63:17.40]Nice work.
[63:18.88]Free experience.
[63:20.28]Thank you.
[63:21.16]I want to see who's in here.
[63:21.89]There's a guy lying down in here.
[63:25.01]Just doing experience farming.
[63:26.67]That's all we're doing.
[63:30.11]Yeah, this guy's like, thank you for saving me.
[63:35.69]Wasn't there a guy I had to, like, find out here anyways?
[63:37.27]Let's just see what this is.
[63:42.66]There's, like, thunder now.
[63:45.10]Dead garden.
[63:47.62]Ah, just found my ten nuggets, by the way.
[63:50.78]Thank you.
[63:54.30]Just picked up my ten nuggets.
[63:56.11]And... And... There was a Snaticat in here.
[64:00.05]An axe.
[64:03.23]An apple.
[64:04.13]Healing herbs.
[64:06.59]People tell me I don't make the fucking right decisions.
[64:10.05]No, no, we're actually, no, no, no.
[64:12.79]Don't do it.
[64:14.27]Change time.
[64:15.15]Stop this.
[64:16.29]Stop it.
[64:16.81]This is fucking ridiculous.
[64:18.64]Get the fuck out of here.
[64:20.24]Why does this have to fucking happen?
[64:22.20]Stop this.
[64:24.82]Turn off scheduled fucking updates.
[64:27.16]Stop it.
[64:27.74]Like, fuck off.
[64:28.44]Pick a time.
[64:28.96]2 a, 3 a.m.
[64:31.38]Like, get the fuck out of here.
[64:35.41]This time is in the past.
[64:37.97]Next fucking Saturday.
[64:39.19]I don't care.
[64:40.29]Get out of here.
[64:43.94]Holy shit.
[64:48.12]It literally gave me like a countdown.
[64:51.94]I don't want to have the stream just turn off.
[64:53.76]Oh, man.
[64:55.84]I understand Windows.
[64:57.08]Listen, Microsoft, I get it.
[64:59.19]you do that because a bunch of the stupid fucking idiot old people that don't understand a computer and they don't know you're like doing this like for the greater good thing where I if I have like an idiot grandmother that has no idea how to use a computer sure that's fine but when I like turn this shit off very clearly don't keep turning it back on like do grandmothers accidentally go into the settings and turn off
[65:25.87]Scheduling times for updates?
[65:28.21]No, my grandmother can't even fucking open up an email.
[65:32.09]My grandmother still uses MSN.
[65:35.21]That shit isn't... My grandmother... My grandpa thinks that MSN is the internet.
[65:40.81]Like, you know... Do you think he's gonna open up fucking the settings and go into... I'm done.
[65:48.00]I ain't talking about it anymore.
[65:49.60]I don't understand.
[65:50.12]I don't know how that's possible.
[65:56.93]Like they do these features for like the lowest fucking common denominator of people.
[66:05.49]Grandma just unsubscribed.
[66:07.97]It's true though.
[66:08.77]Like I don't understand.
[66:10.75]Like if you're going to have power users and casual users, I'm a power user.
[66:16.89]Not a very good power user, but I am.
[66:20.49]Let me like just check it.
[66:21.39]Look, when I open up my computer, open up Windows, install Windows for the first time.
[66:26.34]Give me a checkbox that says, are you a fucking idiot?
[66:30.33]Have you ever used a computer in your life?
[66:32.67]Can I check the box that says yes?
[66:35.23]And where did the guy go?
[66:36.79]Where did my friend go?
[66:39.59]God damn it.
[66:45.13]Where did he go?
[66:45.61]I have no idea.
[66:48.32]He's gone.
[66:48.64]He left me.
[66:54.02]I got ditched.
[66:55.68]there's apparently this guy over here so we're going to talk to this guy hey you who me no your grandmother who else could I be I wouldn't go down that way if I were you why not you can't have been here long man that's the way to the earth they'll make mincemeat out of you guys listen oh you're welcome sorry there are orcs down here okay
[67:23.94]No, you idiot.
[67:25.10]Your stupid grandfather.
[67:26.28]We're not even on weed anymore.
[67:41.04]He knows.
[67:44.40]That'll be ten ores.
[67:45.56]I can actually go back and do that, but we gotta do an interesting thing.
[67:52.47]That seems like way too many enemies placed in the road.
[68:00.81]Okay, that's pretty deliberate.
[68:04.97]So we're just going to go around.
[68:08.47]Ten ores joke incoming.
[68:09.99]Ten orcs joke.
[68:13.79]This is getting bright.
[68:18.40]It's easy, guys.
[68:20.44]You just have to walk around and go over the tunnel.
[68:24.13]And then you make it to the orc lands.
[68:25.85]Okay, they're the orcs.
[68:28.27]Now, are orcs like sentient in this game or are they kill on sight?
[68:33.72]Looks like they're... Looks like they are kill on sight.
[68:39.68]Oh dear.
[68:40.86]We're going... Why are they elephants?
[68:44.16]Why are they elephants?
[68:47.91]Off-road.
[68:52.96]Oh, God, no we won't.
[68:57.68]Okay.
[69:06.73]We stood up to die.
[69:08.03]I love how we did like a PUBG fucking parachute dive.
[69:21.81]Alright, let's go.
[69:26.35]Where's the real... Let's go back to the weed.
[69:32.09]I need to fucking be... I want to do that.
[69:35.95]Where is he?
[69:38.99]Where's my friend?
[69:40.91]I don't want to lose this guy.
[69:44.37]He must have... He just killed this shit.
[69:47.75]Where did he go?
[69:52.00]But where is he?
[69:53.54]Wasn't he just standing right here?
[69:54.70]Next to the angry chickens?
[69:58.76]Which way?
[69:59.44]Why did he leave?
[70:03.22]Did he go back to the camp?
[70:10.43]Get out of here.
[70:11.07]We're going to reload this.
[70:13.41]I have all this shit.
[70:18.61]Well, we can't go that way.
[70:21.38]And I'm like on this quest with this guy that doesn't exist.
[70:30.25]I'm gonna backtrack and just like... See, the first guy that asks for ore is gonna get it too.
[70:37.57]He was down here, right?
[70:42.13]Yeah, I know.
[70:45.71]Why does that guy have to stop me every time?
[70:48.49]You want some ore?
[70:52.00]Where is he?
[70:53.36]He's not down there.
[70:55.64]Over here.
[70:56.07]Is this the guy that wants the ore?
[70:59.29]The guy with the McDonald's french fry for a weapon?
[71:02.85]What is this guy using for a weapon?
[71:05.95]Is that a gun?
[71:08.07]Oh, no.
[71:08.47]It's a crossbow.
[71:09.31]Let me pass!
[71:10.11]Where was that guy?
[71:11.51]Somebody's kissing over here.
[71:12.49]I hear smooches.
[71:24.61]No, shadow.
[71:25.35]Wait a minute.
[71:25.90]Didn't say I needed to impress this guy?
[71:27.94]You shouldn't believe everything in here.
[71:33.16]I'd like to join the... Alright, well... I'd like to join the shadow.
[71:36.40]We're going to join this guy.
[71:37.42]Oh.
[71:38.61]Then you should know that Gomez doesn't tolerate failures.
[71:41.61]I got ten ore for you.
[71:42.38]If you want to be one of us, you have to be prepared to go through fire for him.
[71:47.72]Only half of those who tried ever got accepted.
[71:50.44]Only the most difficult, horrible things.
[71:51.82]They're probably sitting in the new camp munching rice.
[71:56.93]It's so hard.
[71:58.29]Only the best can join the shadows.
[72:01.57]No one else can do it.
[72:04.17]That'll be ten ore.
[72:06.11]I'd like to join the shadows.
[72:07.68]Oh.
[72:08.82]then you should only half of those what happened to the rest of them they're probably okay so how do I like I want to join this guy didn't help me at all thanks a lot thanks for nothing well let's go back to weed guy where is he no he's not over here I'm not gonna like track him down again
[72:38.64]They're probably over there, like, eating food.
[72:41.91]Yeah, no shit.
[72:46.07]See?
[72:46.39]They're here to hang on.
[72:47.11]I'm not gonna rush into anything.
[72:48.21]Those are the guys that were just, like, smooching.
[72:49.53]Shadow.
[72:50.12]Oh, no, that's... Okay, I get it.
[72:50.84]This Fletcher.
[72:51.96]Here are the guys that are... What happened to the guy that... God.
[73:07.19]I have the worst sense of direction.
[73:09.59]Well, I mean, come on, man.
[73:12.39]Give me a little bit of slack.
[73:14.61]The guy disappeared.
[73:15.51]I shouldn't have to come down here again.
[73:18.17]A bunch of people gave bits, too.
[73:26.65]Hold on a second.
[73:27.27]I need to take a look at this.
[73:30.08]It's a giant circle.
[73:31.48]I don't remember where that guy was.
[73:35.21]That guy was in two different places.
[73:36.78]See, here he is.
[73:39.70]He smokes weed up here, and then he appears somewhere else.
[73:42.88]Like, it's this guy.
[73:48.42]I need to get into the castle.
[73:50.42]Can you help me?
[73:51.80]I fear I cannot, brother.
[73:53.66]We gather swamp wood.
[73:55.02]Okay, I know, but let's go.
[73:59.23]I have a letter for the High Magician of the Circle of Fire.
[74:01.89]Oh.
[74:03.00]And where did you get that?
[74:04.08]You're stupid, but do yourself most... Yeah, he talks a bunch of shit.
[74:10.21]And then, like, he appears later down the road.
[74:12.77]This guy is two times in this game.
[74:16.35]You understand?
[74:16.93]Like, that guy's down here, too.
[74:20.21]Is it sense of direction, or is it the guy is a double-bodied person?
[74:26.23]Stupid.
[74:27.45]Because then he was down this way, right?
[74:31.61]They're different people.
[74:35.63]Are they actually different people?
[74:40.67]Am I lost again?
[74:41.45]Oh, but dude, that's all I do is get lost in games like this.
[74:45.69]Well, welcome to the stream.
[74:48.71]Hey, man.
[74:50.35]I'm Fisk.
[74:51.86]I trade goods of all kinds.
[74:53.34]Why does this guy get music?
[74:54.36]If you ever need anything, you're in the right place here.
[74:59.66]Alright, well, cool.
[75:01.46]Show me your goods.
[75:02.12]You're the one that gets music.
[75:04.94]Ore nugget.
[75:06.00]One.
[75:06.16]Alright, so I can get a bunch of ore.
[75:08.76]Rusty sword.
[75:09.66]Should I get some more ore nuggets?
[75:13.33]Let's get like 10 more ore nuggets.
[75:16.09]That sounds about right.
[75:18.49]Yeah, let's do that.
[75:19.23]Apparently not.
[75:31.77]Show me your goods.
[75:35.09]Oh, this is the guy playing the music.
[75:37.67]Okay, I thought the guy just had, like, a song playing for no reason.
[75:42.83]Some meat?
[75:43.25]Alright.
[75:46.95]Did I voice all the characters in this game?
[75:49.71]That would be very funny.
[75:52.35]Maybe, maybe one day.
[75:53.77]Alright, so, like, where was... Where was that guy?
[75:59.13]He was, like, over here.
[75:59.95]This is where, like, Mordrag is.
[76:03.54]Where's the fucking weed guy?
[76:07.10]Oh my god.
[76:08.16]We left out this way.
[76:11.56]He was like, follow me!
[76:12.94]But I don't even... Dude, so much dumb shit happened in between that.
[76:15.66]I don't even remember where the hell he was in the first place.
[76:18.10]Because then I'm back here with this guy.
[76:23.33]He went up to the swamp without me.
[76:24.51]He may have actually done that.
[76:29.61]He may have gone to the swamp.
[76:34.59]is that a possibility that he's just there the guy was where you just were but he's not there anymore so hey he must be in in the swamp so we're gonna go to the swamp what a waste of like eight minutes he ditched me well I figured whatever let's just go this way I I think he was gonna go up here
[77:04.94]Somebody's wrote in all caps.
[77:06.00]Oh my god.
[77:06.66]Stop playing this.
[77:08.40]No.
[77:10.02]He went across the bridge.
[77:10.90]I remember the dog.
[77:14.52]Does it have a quest journal?
[77:15.50]It does have a quest journal, but it's pretty... Concurrent missions.
[77:20.04]Admission to the old camp.
[77:21.13]Admission to the swamp camp.
[77:23.49]Bael Parvez is a missionary in the Brotherhood.
[77:25.47]He stays in the old camp to look up for new believers in the sleeper.
[77:30.39]He offered to accompany me to the swamp camp, the home of the Brotherhood.
[77:34.51]But that's about it, though.
[77:37.26]That's all I get.
[77:38.40]Which, it's apparently over this way.
[77:40.52]I'm going to save.
[77:42.36]I'm going to continue this one.
[77:48.50]I want to try to avoid fights, because I'm not going to be able to do it by myself.
[77:56.90]I'm just going to say it's over here.
[77:59.10]Hopefully not too far.
[78:02.84]Alright, if I were a swamp, because I remember the bees.
[78:05.60]I remember we got attacked by the bees and I died over here.
[78:08.26]So it's this way.
[78:17.23]God damn it.
[78:19.87]Well, here's the impasse.
[78:21.09]Is it to the left or to the right?
[78:23.81]I'm going to say we're going to check the right.
[78:32.63]Is this them?
[78:35.33]This doesn't look like them.
[78:38.35]No, in fact... In fact, don't... That don't look like them at all.
[78:42.42]These are wolverines with sticks in their hands.
[78:50.88]Alright.
[78:51.70]Everybody fucking said...
[79:13.48]Oh, there's the thumbnail.
[79:14.38]Fucking little shits.
[79:23.54]I ain't gonna let a couple of goblins fuck this up for me.
[79:29.06]I'm gonna cut this rope.
[79:30.40]I wonder if it'll work.
[79:36.44]Alright, let's train the bees over here.
[79:54.80]Okay, obviously not going that way.
[80:02.80]We're going the other way.
[80:03.74]We're going up here.
[80:13.47]That chicken sound is in like a bunch of Looney Tunes cartoons.
[80:18.31]Alright, we're looking for a swamp.
[80:20.94]Up by the swamp.
[80:22.02]Over here?
[80:22.40]They're like rubber ducks.
[80:29.45]Is it possible to kill anything in this game?
[80:31.77]I think there is.
[80:32.57]But I need to do the mission.
[80:35.85]But I got distracted.
[80:37.53]And I helped a guy.
[80:38.49]And now I don't know where I am.
[80:41.51]Because the guy that was supposed to accompany me just ditched me.
[80:43.73]And there's no way to find him.
[80:46.08]This looks like a swamp to me.
[80:47.80]Or a forest.
[80:57.27]Let's try over here.
[80:59.47]I need to get stronger.
[81:00.35]I need to level up.
[81:03.13]And if I know anything about games like this, I need to hit some things with some heavy objects and then find my way into the skill tree.
[81:12.60]Can I go in the water here?
[81:18.36]I'm not going to go over the edge here and die, right?
[81:23.97]Okay, you can swim in this game.
[81:26.75]And by swim, I mean, like, hold my body upside down and... I think that's it, though.
[81:50.54]I think that's the place.
[81:54.88]Hey, you're good!
[81:58.05]Is this Wirehead again?
[82:04.07]Well, let's go up here.
[82:09.19]101 ways to die.
[82:11.27]That is the swamp camp.
[82:12.55]It has to be.
[82:14.61]That was a swamp.
[82:16.71]If this bridge breaks, then we're gonna have an issue.
[82:20.81]Don't do it.
[82:22.87]Don't put those fucked up noises on me.
[82:25.81]Don't treat me like an idiot.
[82:26.97]This is the first time there's been any audio to anything that I've stepped on or touched.
[82:33.95]Oh, it's just there to scare you.
[82:35.07]Okay.
[82:39.26]They just, they, they followed that with a kind of rocking chair.
[82:42.64]And it's still, I can still hear it.
[82:44.24]And there's like a sacrifice circle over there.
[82:45.98]Wait, did I, where, where did I go?
[82:48.86]Where's the waterfall?
[82:50.00]Right there, right?
[82:51.88]Is that the camp?
[82:54.01]Did I make it?
[82:57.29]Let's save it.
[83:03.81]Why was all the skulls and shit?
[83:06.99]I feel like I didn't go the right way.
[83:10.83]I have to get down there though.
[83:12.89]Just don't run into any suspicious people.
[83:17.56]Oh god, I think I have to go that way.
[83:19.80]Is there a way to drop down safely?
[83:25.00]I don't think so.
[83:27.30]Great.
[83:32.34]I don't think I can make it.
[83:33.19]No, I can't make it.
[83:34.73]Where's the correct way to get... Okay, there's a road over there.
[83:37.47]There's a road next to the waterfall.
[83:39.21]God.
[83:40.95]Aye, aye, aye.
[83:41.63]We're gonna go for a fucking skate here.
[83:43.85]I'm, like, pretty good at this shit, guys.
[83:45.97]I actually am pretty good at this.
[83:49.47]Like, I'm not gonna lie to you guys.
[83:50.84]Like, I might be able to pull this off.
[83:58.86]It's a feature in the game.
[84:03.40]Fucking what did I tell you?
[84:16.37]It was going so well.
[84:23.06]It was going so well, too.
[84:25.54]Well, at least I know where to go.
[84:29.53]And nearly had it.
[84:34.06]Good feature.
[84:36.96]We just got to go down this road.
[84:38.56]And we'll finally get there.
[84:40.36]And then we can end this madness.
[84:43.30]Anyways.
[84:45.00]Thank you so much to Dreadful Judge.
[84:47.94]Yo, German.
[84:48.42]Really enjoying the streams.
[84:49.25]Especially Wirehead.
[84:50.13]I know this isn't a stream related.
[84:51.77]But would you consider streaming a Borderlands game?
[84:57.55]No.
[84:58.01]Probably no.
[85:00.55]No.
[85:02.53]Borderlands is like... I can't say it because it'll make people angry.
[85:07.26]And I don't want to make you guys angry.
[85:10.04]But I don't... Borderlands is dumb.
[85:14.46]I just did it.
[85:15.00]I just said it.
[85:16.32]And now I'm in big trouble with the whole internet.
[85:20.40]I'm sorry.
[85:20.98]I'm sorry.
[85:21.64]I said it.
[85:24.28]Like... Okay, Borderlands 1...
[85:31.20]okay cool interesting idea there he is there's the guy uh he's been waiting for me this whole time what a what a bro well look look look look look look okay here here's the thing with the here's the thing with gearbox gearbox like accidentally made borderlands and then they they made it like three more times and then they made a bunch of other awful games
[85:56.63]They fell down and smashed a clock in their hands.
[85:59.89]A broken clock is right twice a day.
[86:02.73]Gearbox fucking sucks.
[86:04.29]And they made one decent kind of game that was kind of good.
[86:10.92]I'm sorry.
[86:11.66]That's honestly how I feel.
[86:19.00]I really, really believe that.
[86:21.06]Here we are.
[86:22.48]Down there lies the camp of the Brotherhood.
[86:25.40]Go through the gate and speak to my brothers.
[86:27.74]Borderlands is not a bad game.
[86:28.66]I'm sure you haven't come here for nothing.
[86:31.06]Ask for Kor Kalam.
[86:33.02]He's in charge of the novices and tutors.
[86:35.88]I'll go back to the old camp.
[86:37.65]There are still many infidels who need to be guided to the right path.
[86:42.17]Good luck.
[86:42.99]Look at their last... Look at Borderlands... Look at Gearbox's last... Wait, did he just...
[86:50.78]Hold on, he couldn't have just... Why did he come with me?
[86:54.46]This guy told me to come all the way down here to tell me that, to leave, to go back home, to go back to the camp.
[87:00.55]Why wouldn't you just tell me where the camp is?
[87:02.99]That seems really dumb.
[87:07.77]Whatever.
[87:09.73]But Gearbox's last few games have been just abysmal launches.
[87:17.82]Like, you're talking about, like, Battleborn.
[87:19.39]You're talking about aliens, colonial marines.
[87:23.59]Like, what the fuck have they been doing the last, like, three years?
[87:26.11]Four, like, even, like, five years?
[87:27.39]All right, well, here we go.
[87:30.93]I've joined them.
[87:33.51]Borderlands is cool.
[87:34.38]I want to join you.
[87:44.02]I've heard you're looking for new people.
[87:45.68]I want to join you.
[87:47.06]Then, be welcome.
[87:49.68]The Brotherhood of the Sleeper has a place for everybody who wants to be led by the spirit of the Sleeper.
[87:56.59]If you're really serious, you should try to get Baal Namib's attention.
[88:01.33]He's standing in the courtyard just behind the gate.
[88:05.07]But you may not speak to him.
[88:06.87]Wait until he addresses you.
[88:12.79]Here we go.
[88:13.87]I need I need stuff.
[88:14.91]I need armor You have to earn a Templars armor like I'm wearing but you can have a novices loincloth better than nothing You won't get it for free though weapons 500 or
[88:36.12]Loincloth protection weapons 15 fire 500 or for a loincloth Okay, give me the loincloth come back as soon as you have enough or that's a horse shit these guys suck Okay, let's go in and talk So well my the point I was making before
[88:57.42]So, Gearbox... Gearbox made those Half-Life games.
[89:02.16]The games that were, like, the Half-Life offshoots, right?
[89:05.46]And then they started to do their own shit.
[89:07.35]And, like, they made a couple of decent things in a row.
[89:09.27]But look at the last, like, five years.
[89:11.93]You had Battleborn last year, which, like, what the hell happened there?
[89:16.43]You had, like, Duke Nukem.
[89:17.77]Like, what the fuck happened there?
[89:19.99]You had, like, the weird other, like, Borderlands offshoot games.
[89:24.07]And then you had Aliens Colonial Marines.
[89:28.55]Like, what the fuck has that... Like, what have they even been doing?
[89:36.59]Like, 2010 to the present.
[89:37.41]Let's see here.
[89:40.72]Apparently they're making another Duke Nukem game.
[89:43.82]Why wouldn't you just throw that shit in the trash?
[89:48.38]You know what I mean?
[89:48.94]Like, what... Why are you even making another Duke Nukem game?
[89:53.81]What the hell are you thinking?
[89:54.68]Alright, uh, we're going to say the guy was behind the tree or something.
[90:01.04]Hi, I'm new here.
[90:02.92]Hi, I'm new here.
[90:11.37]Is everything alright, pal?
[90:16.13]Is he asleep?
[90:17.61]The sleeper be with you.
[90:21.79]Alright, what about this guy?
[90:22.75]Does this guy have anything to say?
[90:24.13]You addressed a guru.
[90:26.31]Never do that again.
[90:27.99]It's sacrilege.
[90:29.39]If a master wants to talk to you, he shall address you.
[90:36.03]But I want to talk to the master.
[90:37.75]But I want to talk to your master.
[90:39.67]Forget it.
[90:40.75]I'm sure I can help you with any of your problems.
[90:45.60]Who are you?
[90:46.56]I'm Lester.
[90:47.86]I take care of the strangers who arrive here.
[90:51.72]Okay, I want to become a member of the camp.
[90:54.74]I want to become a member of the Brotherhood.
[90:57.38]Kor Kolom decides whether you're ready to join the Brotherhood.
[91:01.16]But he relies on the advice of other gurus.
[91:04.40]Bal Namib over there is one of them.
[91:06.60]First, you'll have to prove that you're worthy.
[91:09.54]And then one of the gurus will send you to Kor Kolom.
[91:12.60]All right.
[91:15.59]How's that supposed to work if none of the gurus will talk to me?
[91:19.95]It might not look like it, but the gurus observe everything you do here in the camp.
[91:25.33]If they think that you deserve to become a member of the community, they'll talk to you.
[91:30.39]You're bound to have opportunities in the camp to prove that you're worthy.
[91:37.99]May the sleeper protect you.
[91:41.02]Apparently not all of us, though.
[91:45.35]I'm gonna give this one more shot here.
[91:47.17]I'm gonna talk to like one more Naree.
[91:49.63]What's his name?
[91:50.23]Is he over here?
[91:54.62]This game is just a series of like get stopped by guy that is angry with you or that wants something from you.
[91:59.78]Come on.
[92:00.72]Where is he?
[92:02.28]Novice.
[92:03.42]Smoking out of a peace pipe.
[92:04.91]Joru.
[92:06.93]None of you guys have that name.
[92:15.75]Brothers in arms.
[92:16.61]So where is he?
[92:23.31]Where's this, like, magic mystery guy?
[92:28.84]In this one?
[92:30.96]Or am I gonna get yelled at for being in here?
[92:32.42]Do quests in the camp.
[92:36.27]Alright, well... Give me a quest, man!
[92:40.97]How about you?
[92:43.39]Does this guy have something for me to do?
[92:48.32]What are you doing?
[92:49.80]I'm still a novice myself, but soon I'll be a bow.
[92:53.80]I've even spoken to Iberian.
[92:55.46]He's the chosen one.
[92:56.90]He told me that, but I'm still putting that off.
[92:59.48]There's no rush, you understand?
[93:01.18]I can still become a master.
[93:03.68]At the moment, I'm quite happy about my current task.
[93:06.45]When did I say that?
[93:09.36]When did I say I was going to complete all the Gothic games?
[93:11.69]I said we were going to start Gothic.
[93:13.49]And guess what?
[93:13.99]There's five of them.
[93:15.07]We'll find the right one.
[93:16.19]We'll find the one that's fun to play.
[93:18.27]And that's the one we're going to play.
[93:21.53]I am having fun with this one.
[93:24.19]Come on.
[93:26.64]I didn't say that yesterday.
[93:27.64]What are you talking about?
[93:28.36]I'd like to join your camp.
[93:30.24]Can you help me?
[93:31.42]You want to join us?
[93:32.54]That's good.
[93:33.46]Just wait.
[93:34.62]Yes, I think I can help you.
[93:37.14]I'm not a guru yet, but I have some influence in the Brotherhood.
[93:41.41]You'd have to do me a favor.
[93:43.59]Have you seen Fortuno yet?
[93:45.65]No, that's a person that I've never spoken to.
[93:48.61]Then go.
[93:49.59]See him and collect your daily ration.
[93:51.79]If you leave me all the swamp weed he gives you, we're in business.
[93:55.03]Wait, he wants my weed?
[93:55.87]I'll think about it.
[93:59.34]I have swamp weed on me.
[94:00.48]You can have it.
[94:02.94]Okay, well, where is he?
[94:03.88]Hold on.
[94:05.50]Somebody was saying the sound is a little high.
[94:10.58]Effects and language.
[94:13.36]Music on sound provider miles fast.
[94:17.24]Okay, that might be a little bit better.
[94:20.13]Alright, let's go get our ration.
[94:25.23]Novice, novice.
[94:29.80]Um... Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[94:34.72]To get my daily ration of food.
[94:36.34]Over here?
[94:36.70]Yeah, this looks like a place I haven't been.
[94:43.26]Talos?
[94:44.33]Alright.
[94:44.89]What about you?
[94:51.00]Templar.
[94:54.39]I think that guy up there, is it the food guy?
[94:56.19]Is it you?
[95:00.45]Valtirion?
[95:01.17]No.
[95:01.71]We need the guy that gives the food.
[95:02.83]I'm just gonna, I'm completing this quest.
[95:05.33]I'm gonna give this guy my shit.
[95:09.65]I want my daily, I want my daily dose.
[95:11.95]Where's my drug dealer?
[95:12.85]Come on.
[95:15.09]Templar.
[95:18.03]Templar, where is he?
[95:21.90]I'm climbing up the ziggurat right now.
[95:25.00]Okay.
[95:27.40]Go get a guide?
[95:37.29]Well, that's not... I don't want to go get a guide.
[95:42.28]Isn't that just cheating?
[95:44.76]Then I'll be opening up console commands.
[95:50.53]Give the guard you read.
[95:56.97]One hour and 35 minutes to complete one quest.
[96:00.99]Well, to be fair, we've hit the brakes a few times.
[96:07.93]Spawn the NPC I need.
[96:09.31]It is looking like that.
[96:12.49]No clip to rope.
[96:14.01]The way you run is hilarious.
[96:15.88]It is quite humorous.
[96:16.80]I see a guy kneeling over here.
[96:18.56]Hold on.
[96:22.69]Spawn a deathclaw.
[96:24.57]Novice.
[96:25.65]Novice.
[96:26.15]Come on.
[96:27.49]Where's this guy that I need to talk to?
[96:29.94]Templar.
[96:31.48]Maybe this guy... Just tell me where this guy is.
[96:36.50]Where can I find... No, not this guy.
[96:40.40]Second level?
[96:40.98]Second level?
[96:51.87]What the fuck are you even talking about, man?
[96:55.97]I never said I was going to finish this game.
[96:57.39]I said I wanted to check these games out.
[97:03.61]Second level.
[97:07.07]The alchemy lab?
[97:08.27]Like, of... It is very dark, too.
[97:15.07]Very probably.
[97:15.83]What about you?
[97:17.55]No, not this guy.
[97:22.83]Water pipe?
[97:23.51]Can I smoke that?
[97:24.19]Am I gonna get in trouble?
[97:25.31]I don't think I can use it.
[97:33.94]Should I go in the tree?
[97:40.26]I'm going to bore 90% of my audience to death.
[97:43.74]Well, we're just checking it out.
[97:45.32]We're just checking this game out.
[97:47.78]Come on, give me a break.
[97:52.85]You guys voted for this.
[97:55.65]You guys had an option.
[97:58.81]It was either this or red faction gorilla and you guys chose this.
[98:05.51]I am doing control up.
[98:07.07]That's what you don't understand.
[98:08.68]I hit control up on that peace pipe and I sat there and didn't do anything.
[98:12.92]And this guy's just sitting right here.
[98:19.06]I know how to use items.
[98:24.88]Who the fuck chose this?
[98:27.06]No, this is a classic.
[98:29.50]But with classic games comes classic responsibility.
[98:34.98]Climb the fucking ladder.
[98:39.67]Okay.
[98:41.03]That's apparently how we do it.
[98:47.29]Okay, for future reference, do not let go of control and up at the same time.
[98:55.44]I'm going to get bored and stop spawning shit.
[99:00.08]Well, I'm on the second level now.
[99:03.28]Not that big.
[99:04.78]Don't get angry with me.
[99:05.54]I'm just looking for one specific person.
[99:08.51]What are you talking about?
[99:09.13]I'm just trying to find this guy that's going to give me weed for free.
[99:12.69]Oh my god.
[99:15.41]It's too dark.
[99:20.25]Where is he?
[99:26.73]Don't make me get into the console this early.
[99:31.59]Classic.
[99:32.09]This is a classic game.
[99:36.79]Yeah, we're on the quest for free weed in the dark black temple.
[99:41.03]Alright, we're on the second level now.
[99:48.65]I'm hoping to find the guy that I'm looking to find.
[99:50.43]Here's the training area.
[99:52.37]Where they train the novices.
[99:54.53]Gornatov.
[99:55.71]That's not the guy.
[99:59.40]Wait, this is... No, that is the same.
[100:01.42]Is this the guy?
[100:04.60]Will you train me?
[100:05.86]You want to become a strong warrior.
[100:08.50]So now you're looking for someone to instruct you.
[100:11.34]That's what I just asked.
[100:12.36]But I'm not the man you want.
[100:14.04]I just asked him that.
[100:15.07]I dedicate my time only to those belonging to the holy circle of Templars.
[100:21.83]Okay.
[100:22.55]Well, how do I become one?
[100:23.77]How can I become a Templar?
[100:25.53]First, you will have to serve as a novice for a while to prove that you truly believe in the sleeper.
[100:32.56]Then come back to me, and I will instruct you.
[100:36.84]I have to say that I'm a novice.
[100:38.44]I don't know who I do that to.
[100:40.40]Templar.
[100:41.36]Kor Angar has spoken to you?
[100:43.86]What did he say?
[100:45.82]He said I should come back as soon as I'm a Templar.
[100:48.36]He said he never liked the swamp sharks.
[100:50.08]He says you'd be unworthy of wearing the armor of a Templar.
[100:53.67]He says you'll be unworthy of wearing the armor of a Templar.
[100:56.85]Never.
[100:57.55]He could not have said that.
[100:58.87]Not about me.
[100:59.83]He did.
[101:00.65]He's a fucking...
[101:03.26]What the fuck?
[101:03.96]I thought he was gonna ta- oh my god.
[101:09.48]You get attacked with a sword for fucking gossip?
[101:11.54]He just- I have ore.
[101:17.63]I have ore in my backpack.
[101:20.35]I thought he was gonna go after the guy that I said he was talking shit.
[101:26.76]Killed for fucking lying.
[101:28.30]Come on, man.
[101:29.12]And I have ore.
[101:33.66]What happened to my ore?
[101:34.50]I had 10 ore.
[101:36.80]Look.
[101:37.68]Dude, you don't really know how to search pockets very well, do you?
[101:41.82]Fucking idiot.
[101:48.66]Alright.
[101:49.56]Well, thanks for nothing.
[101:51.49]Is there a day and night cycle?
[101:53.47]Or is it just darker always?
[101:54.67]I'm gonna accidentally fucking fall off.
[101:58.85]I swear to God.
[102:05.04]Where's the quest for free weed?
[102:07.08]That's what this whole stream has been.
[102:13.39]Novice, novice.
[102:17.57]It's just... I don't know.
[102:24.36]I guess we're gonna go over here.
[102:28.18]Kill him and take it back.
[102:29.02]He didn't take anything.
[102:34.17]Maybe if he took something from me, I would try to take it back.
[102:47.84]Did I find him?
[102:48.86]Is this the guy?
[102:51.14]No, there's so many named people.
[102:53.76]Who the hell are you?
[102:56.16]I'm sure you won't mind me going in there.
[102:57.84]I'm sure you won't mind me going in there.
[102:59.86]If you're disrespectful to my master, I'll kill you.
[103:05.04]Okay.
[103:06.12]I will keep that in mind.
[103:09.32]There he is.
[103:10.58]There he is.
[103:11.28]There's like the main guy, right?
[103:13.11]The main alchemy guy?
[103:15.13]Save it.
[103:21.91]Alright.
[103:22.51]This is the guy I need to talk to.
[103:23.51]Don't shrug.
[103:27.48]Just talk to him.
[103:29.90]I would like to join the brotherhood.
[103:34.69]I would like to join the Brotherhood.
[103:36.70]I've heard you're the master of the novices and that you decide who's allowed to join.
[103:40.04]I don't have time.
[103:42.78]My experiments are too important for me to spend any time on new novices.
[103:48.00]I'll rely on the judgment of the Baals.
[103:50.45]When they say you're ready to wear the robe of a novice, come back to me.
[103:55.27]You're just making me go in all these different directions, man.
[104:02.25]This is just...
[104:04.24]Go ask your father.
[104:06.05]Like, I want to go to the mall, right?
[104:08.25]So I go, I ask my dad, hey dad, can I go to the mall?
[104:11.39]I don't know, go ask your mother.
[104:13.63]And then I go to my mother and I'm like, hey mom, I just, dad wanted to know if I could go to the mall.
[104:18.12]He said, can I go?
[104:20.80]Go ask your father.
[104:22.80]That's all this is.
[104:23.48]This is go ask your father the game.
[104:25.22]You know, you don't even do anything.
[104:26.24]You just go ask people for things.
[104:44.84]Serves him.
[104:46.30]No, that's my ore.
[104:47.16]Give it back.
[104:48.84]Dickhead.
