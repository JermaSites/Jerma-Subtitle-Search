[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.03]a fake name that you would just say on the spot.
[00:04.89]Incredible.
[00:05.37]There we go.
[00:06.11]Let's queue up.
[00:06.77]Let's do this.
[00:09.97]Welcome to the party.
[00:11.53]This will probably be the last game of the stream.
[00:15.66]Hashtag orange favorite color.
[00:18.38]This pink pizza hat.
[00:20.44]The answer was orange.
[00:21.16]Let's do more Etalyx questions.
[00:23.86]What would have been question number two if nobody answered that correctly?
[00:26.62]If nobody answered that correctly...
[00:30.90]Well, earlier I told everyone what my real name was.
[00:33.44]It probably would have been like, how do you correctly spell my first name or something like that.
[00:38.90]Why was Abraham Lincoln no longer president?
[00:43.61]Because he was shot by MLC_St3alth in the time machine.
[00:46.89]Alright, so I got a question for you.
[00:48.31]What is your home address and the times that you are not there?
[00:57.62]What's your home address and precisely the time that you and the people that live in your house are not going to be in the house?
[01:04.59]Well, usually between like 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:07.67]Yeah, we had a winner for how do you spell my name correctly.
[01:09.69]It was Edward Tallix.
[01:11.37]So, yeah, correct answer by Gil Malta.
[01:14.95]Edward Tallix.
[01:15.95]E-Tallix.
[01:17.19]Edward Tallixson.
[01:20.43]Edward Tallixson.
[01:24.69]I might just officially change my name to that.
[01:28.48]What if I did?
[01:29.20]Like, what if, what if, what if Boo changed, officially, like, his name is Bill Boomenson, like, he just got it, like, legally changed.
[01:36.42]And Jerma... Oh, yeah, you're right, I forgot.
[01:38.72]Sorry, what if I got my name changed, officially, to Edward Talickson?
[01:44.00]I would be like, dude, that's, you're the man.
[01:50.02]That's not a bad name, though, let's be honest.
[01:51.98]Edward Talickson.
[01:52.82]That sounds like a strong name.
[01:55.04]It sounds like a reporter's name.
[01:58.34]And we're here tonight with Edward Talikson.
[02:00.76]Edward Talikson, reporting the news.
[02:03.08]I can't really, like, Jerma is like my name.
[02:06.20]Like, Jeremy, Jerma.
[02:07.82]You'd have to be Jim Jerminson.
[02:10.00]Yeah, that'd have to be Jim Jerminson.
[02:12.10]It would have to be that, yes.
[02:13.24]Jim Jerminson.
[02:17.22]Jim Jerminson.
[02:22.51]Hmm.
[02:24.03]Alright, last game.
[02:25.17]There it is.
[02:26.94]Oh yeah.
[02:28.08]Dude, Ares is so good in this.
[02:36.04]Ares is so good.
[02:43.27]Oh, we got more than one viewer on this game.
[02:45.01]Apparently we got someone playing against us as well.
[02:49.95]Gonna beat me.
[02:51.70]He better not be watching and listening to the stream so he doesn't know where we're at.
[02:59.72]Who is it?
[03:00.24]Which one is it?
[03:01.12]Lost86 on the other team, I think.
[03:04.82]Watch out for that guy.
[03:06.48]Right, keep quiet when we're going to fight.
[03:08.36]Make sure you get wards, blah blah blah, you know the rest.
[03:13.62]How funny would it be if there really was Fire Giant in this?
[03:17.56]Where would he be?
[03:20.70]In the middle.
[03:21.54]The middle of the whole map.
[03:22.90]He's just standing in the middle of the map.
[03:26.56]I think at like 10 minutes, he should just rise from the ground and come up from the middle.
[03:30.79]And he's got like a 70 yard aggro radius.
[03:34.09]And he just starts attacking everybody, no matter what.
[03:36.87]That sounds like TF2.
[03:37.81]Yeah, or Merasmus, the new boss.
[03:45.23]I didn't lock him.
[03:46.85]He's tough.
[03:48.11]He's hard.
[03:49.69]He is tough.
[03:50.82]You gotta go at him with a bunch of huntsmen.
[03:52.76]I had to fight him every time in Trade Service.
[04:01.10]Ares, Agni, Cupid, Anho.
[04:05.59]We got a Vamana on their team.
[04:08.95]Watch out, guys.
[04:10.95]And there's a Vamana.
[04:17.52]Alright, let's get it on.
[04:19.02]Sound the drums.
[04:20.36]Alright, let's get it on.
[04:23.90]What should I build?
[04:25.08]Debuilding a Zeus?
[04:27.42]Damage.
[04:27.86]What?
[04:28.85]No, I mean like in what order?
[04:30.21]I would go Boots first.
[04:34.41]It's safe.
[04:36.11]I would go Boots and then... No, I wouldn't go Doom Orb.
[04:40.62]I would go Boots, followed by Void Stone.
[04:44.78]I'd get Spear first.
[04:45.74]They've got three strong magics on their team.
[04:49.64]Yeah, but they also have Loki.
[04:50.36]I'd get Void Stone after this.
[04:52.74]After Spear and the Boots.
[04:53.52]I wish I had Mid Guardian.
[04:54.72]It would be good against Loki, but he kills you too fast.
[04:57.64]I love the steps that this Volcanic Agni places me in.
[05:00.74]What about Sovereignty on Loki?
[05:03.98]That would be great.
[05:04.46]That would be good during this.
[05:06.14]If one of us has it, like, I'll help you.
[05:09.81]Yep.
[05:11.66]Do I like oranges?
[05:12.60]Yes.
[05:13.72]Oranges are pretty great.
[05:14.44]How did that not hit?
[05:18.46]Love, find your mark.
[05:21.01]Uh-oh.
[05:26.45]Ow.
[05:28.05]That wasn't so bad.
[05:31.08]Ow, Hebo.
[05:32.02]Why is Loki going back?
[05:34.43]I don't know.
[05:34.79]He's a fruit trick.
[05:35.53]Hey, remember, Loki, it's a trick.
[05:37.17]He can, like, fake and go back.
[05:38.19]It's one of his moves.
[05:40.77]Imagine that.
[05:41.33]That's one of his actions.
[05:42.45]A god runs, like, to the back of the map.
[05:44.03]That'd be good, actually.
[05:44.59]Could you do that?
[05:45.29]While you, like, recall with Loki, just hit one and, like, disappear.
[05:48.09]This is what I thought.
[05:49.91]I thought Loki would have this ability.
[05:51.19]Like, you know the assassin in Borderlands?
[05:55.20]I thought he was gonna have, like, that ability.
[05:57.46]Like, he goes invisible, and then, like, he has another version of him, like, continue to run forward.
[06:04.82]To like trick everybody?
[06:05.68]Oh, get that Ares!
[06:06.46]Get that Ares!
[06:07.08]Both of them!
[06:08.22]Got him!
[06:10.44]I got him!
[06:10.94]I got him!
[06:11.64]I got him!
[06:15.13]I got him!
[06:16.41]I got him!
[06:17.55]I got him!
[06:17.91]I got him!
[06:18.41]I got him!
[06:26.96]Oh god!
[06:27.98]Oh no!
[06:29.58]You alright?
[06:32.00]Oh, do I have enough mana?
[06:32.82]I need to detonate him and he'll probably die!
[06:35.73]Come on, mana!
[06:36.65]Too late, it's gone.
[06:39.35]The charges last three seconds.
[06:40.49]Speaking of mana, that's a good idea.
[06:48.12]Shoot.
[06:48.46]Zeus is so good at escaping slows.
[06:54.60]Man, Loki is so scary.
[06:55.35]Let's get Fatalis as well.
[06:57.09]Where's he at, by the way?
[06:57.83]I don't know.
[06:58.17]I think he's to the left of us.
[07:07.39]Look at that lino minions.
[07:08.61]Minions.
[07:14.18]Alright, random question that probably no one knows the answer to.
[07:17.48]If you heartbomb someone and then upgrade your heartbomb before it explodes, does it do the upgraded damage or the old damage?
[07:24.65]Probably the old one.
[07:26.71]Who would ever do that?
[07:28.25]I just did it.
[07:30.95]That's why I was curious.
[07:31.71]I just wanted to know.
[07:35.62]We've got three votes for old and one vote for upgraded in the chat.
[07:39.50]Oh, you're like voting for it.
[07:40.80]Yeah.
[07:41.60]Ow.
[07:43.30]Alright, Ares wants a piece.
[07:48.23]There he goes.
[07:48.59]He's just going to go straight for Agni.
[07:49.83]He doesn't even care.
[07:54.55]I stunned him for you.
[07:56.17]Oh man, he's hurting me.
[07:58.69]Get that Loki.
[08:00.53]I'll detonate him if he gets away.
[08:01.87]Nice.
[08:02.59]Good job, good job.
[08:04.35]I'm low on mana.
[08:05.43]That Ares really only went for me.
[08:07.93]Yeah.
[08:08.27]It's weird.
[08:09.45]They're all too spread out.
[08:10.55]I need boots.
[08:12.63]Too slow.
[08:21.41]That Ares is pretty low.
[08:28.95]And Zeus is going to have to go back now.
[08:37.15]I see you, Loki.
[08:38.31]You don't fool me.
[08:38.85]Oh, I thought I was going to be able to hit him.
[08:40.65]Come on.
[08:40.93]Bring it.
[08:41.33]Come on.
[08:42.27]He didn't do it.
[08:42.74]That's show.
[08:45.28]Watch out.
[08:45.78]We got a couple people here.
[08:47.84]Loki's here, too.
[08:49.22]Whose back is he going to jump on?
[08:51.66]Probably mine.
[08:52.88]I thought he was going to jump on mine, but he didn't.
[08:55.97]lives to be a producing skills if this uses this print I gather you invisible is out up now you go as slow as like a parked car cop car parked car I'll as well the cop car the red car as low as a you know how well-known they are for jeans need bring that
[09:21.47]I knew it.
[09:23.89]That's so Etalyx.
[09:25.77]Actually, that's usually stealth.
[09:27.51]It's usually stealth.
[09:28.71]Wait, what did I do?
[09:29.77]You didn't say, like, the daisy red car joke thing.
[09:34.26]Oh, dang it.
[09:35.30]What am I thinking?
[09:35.84]I did.
[09:36.34]I said it instead.
[09:37.08]It's okay.
[09:38.52]I got three of them.
[09:39.66]Come on, instead.
[09:40.96]Oh, well, I pulled them away from your thing.
[09:42.18]I'm sorry.
[09:43.90]Oh, detonate.
[09:45.18]Oh.
[09:45.50]Nice.
[09:46.30]Oh, no.
[09:46.84]Ares is low.
[09:49.97]I tried the Aegis in case he detonated and he didn't detonate.
[09:52.64]Man, I can't hurt that guy.
[09:56.26]I'll get that Ares.
[09:58.60]Heal up and go back out into the fray.
[10:00.44]Ares.
[10:03.76]Loki's got no mana.
[10:04.75]We're doing pretty good this time.
[10:06.59]Doing pretty good.
[10:18.69]Yeah, I'd say so.
[10:20.41]We don't have an O in whatever Loki this time?
[10:26.02]Ugh.
[10:26.94]Oh, he's hurt.
[10:30.74]Now he's big baby.
[10:32.19]We made him pop the baby.
[10:38.55]That phrase.
[10:40.49]I see Ares looking suspicious over there.
[10:43.30]Who'd you just shoot at?
[10:46.30]Domano was dashing in that way and then he just took a U-turn.
[10:49.98]Ares is about to come in on us.
[10:51.30]I feel like he wants him.
[10:54.02]I just stunned Loki out of his stealth.
[10:59.45]They're playing really far back.
[11:03.25]Where's Loki?
[11:03.97]I'm always terrified of him.
[11:05.51]How long until your ultimate?
[11:07.09]three seconds.
[11:08.39]We're like waiting on his ultimate.
[11:10.15]Yeah.
[11:12.63]Oh, my God.
[11:13.35]I got all five.
[11:16.11]I got one.
[11:16.67]That was just absolute cottage.
[11:18.61]I had four of them.
[11:20.17]Well, we got one of them.
[11:22.65]Uh-oh.
[11:23.05]Uh-oh.
[11:25.73]Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
[11:26.99]No, he was the only one there.
[11:31.19]My chain's... I got the player kill!
[11:33.29]I got the kill for that!
[11:34.83]Wow!
[11:35.83]Nice job!
[11:36.63]Oh!
[11:37.61]Oh, poor guy.
[11:39.54]What happened?
[11:41.00]Oh, no.
[11:42.32]Oh, this is a mana.
[11:47.02]Okay.
[11:49.14]Oh, no.
[11:49.62]They're all charging.
[11:51.50]Run, Zeus.
[11:52.44]Run.
[11:53.23]Oh, man.
[11:59.37]He takes a long time.
[12:01.03]My goodness, man.
[12:01.83]That guy died in literally less than one second.
[12:09.87]That was ridiculous.
[12:11.61]Close up.
[12:12.82]Yeah, nice stun.
[12:14.66]Cool.
[12:15.32]Yeah, Hibo.
[12:16.04]You better run, Hibo.
[12:18.32]We'll get you.
[12:19.96]If you can grab him again, boo.
[12:22.79]I got eight seconds.
[12:40.22]because it's awesome.
[12:41.82]I just dropped my ultimate right in the middle of where you come down.
[12:44.68]Uh-oh.
[12:49.30]Here it comes.
[12:50.28]Here it comes.
[12:52.32]And... Just the Ares.
[12:55.62]The worst one.
[12:56.22]Nice.
[13:01.53]So fun.
[13:02.99]I love Ares.
[13:03.71]He's such a baller.
[13:04.53]He is really strong.
[13:08.86]I only have two kills.
[13:09.68]Whoops.
[13:18.63]Oh no, I'm gonna die.
[13:20.37]Yeah, Ares is coming this way.
[13:21.79]Watch out.
[13:25.21]No, I'm gonna die.
[13:27.05]No, you don't.
[13:27.87]Yeah, I'm getting out of here.
[13:31.04]This looks dangerous.
[13:31.82]I might die.
[13:38.58]I'm trying, Boo.
[13:40.22]Thanks.
[13:41.16]Pick up the hearts.
[13:43.14]Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[13:44.28]Thanks.
[13:45.12]Now I'm going to die.
[13:46.64]Oh, he got me.
[13:47.56]How?
[13:47.98]Did he just come into the tower?
[13:50.42]Yes.
[13:51.45]Wow.
[13:52.53]Okay, okay.
[13:53.59]I see how it is.
[13:55.41]Oh, you've got to stop that.
[13:59.47]Oh, he got him.
[14:00.13]No, he didn't.
[14:00.77]Oh, he almost did, though.
[14:01.95]Just barely.
[14:02.43]Oh, I might get him.
[14:04.87]Oh, minions so close.
[14:05.95]Yep, I got him.
[14:06.65]I got the minions.
[14:13.36]Alright, we're good.
[14:17.20]Where's their team?
[14:19.84]In the middle of the map.
[14:21.22]Oh, they're grouping up.
[14:24.04]Look at that.
[14:28.87]Punish Ares for using Aegis too late.
[14:33.93]I have no mana.
[14:35.39]I want to dive in there, but... Do it.
[14:40.53]Well, I'm a cupid.
[14:42.15]Holy Zeus.
[14:43.99]Oh, I almost killed him.
[14:44.91]Hey, Hebo comes out, pops his abilities, and then instantly runs back.
[14:48.65]Watch out for Loki.
[14:51.64]Oh, boy.
[14:52.10]Loki's on me.
[14:52.72]I'm going down.
[14:53.22]Okay.
[15:00.87]Oh, he just needs one more shot.
[15:03.47]Oh, meanwhile, with Ares.
[15:05.71]Hi.
[15:06.61]Don't mind me.
[15:07.65]I'm just going to get heboed over my face for talking about him dirty.
[15:12.05]I shouldn't have said anything.
[15:13.32]This is getting close.
[15:15.46]Yeah.
[15:18.28]Who is playing with Etalyx, asks Louie.
[15:20.98]I'm currently playing with Jerma, MLC_St3alth, and BooMan61.
[15:27.62]Those are all the beautiful people in this chat.
[15:31.36]You're not so bad looking yourself.
[15:37.04]Oh, those charges.
[15:38.84]Oh, my.
[15:42.54]Ouch.
[15:43.32]Run.
[15:45.89]Yes, run.
[15:46.75]Oh, no.
[15:50.45]No, no, no.
[15:55.95]You gotta be kidding me.
[15:57.11]He waited until after I ages to strike and I only had five health left or something ridiculous.
[16:02.71]Oh That was close No, we're losing the lady Look he's over there.
[16:12.03]I Thought you said monkey for a second.
[16:15.71]I was like what see in this game We got a group
[16:24.07]Loki's got like three buffs now.
[16:27.42]Man, I am so scared of Loki right now.
[16:35.32]Not anymore.
[16:36.86]You guys need some Aegis.
[16:44.43]I have Aegis.
[16:45.95]It's down.
[16:46.45]I got it right now.
[16:46.99]I'm using it.
[16:48.45]I'm so dead when I come out of this.

[17:25.85]Yep.
[17:27.77]You doing super damage now?
[17:32.98]Getting smoked by Loki.
[17:35.92]Oh, his health is going way down.
[17:38.44]Oh, baby.
[17:39.48]I can never get last hit on any of these guys.
[17:41.24]Oh, I'm dead.
[17:46.42]I tried.
[17:47.84]Yeah, this is gonna happen.
[17:50.14]Once Ares gets his burns on you, that's GG.
[17:56.75]Rod of Tahu is recommended for Ares.
[18:01.05]Kind of unusual.
[18:06.86]Oh, you pushed him out of my... Oh, there we go.
[18:10.32]It's okay.
[18:13.28]Where is he?
[18:13.62]He's on airs.
[18:14.89]An enemy has been slain.
[18:17.17]Ulti overkill!
[18:18.21]Wow, I just had to get rid of that guy.
[18:24.37]When you had that much health to stick around, you just paid for it.
[18:28.23]You know, I would love to give away some gems, but I don't have any gems.
[18:31.72]Not even for myself.
[18:33.62]Give them.
[18:34.24]I have none.
[18:35.12]I have zero.
[18:39.58]Oops.
[18:40.46]Here comes a pull.
[18:44.20]I actually have Aegis this time.
[18:46.84]I didn't have it.
[18:47.82]Loki's... Oh!
[18:48.98]He's on me!
[18:51.58]What?
[18:52.54]Oh, I got killed by the bleed damage.
[18:56.28]Oh, Vamana's low.
[18:56.90]No, I missed my Aegis.
[19:03.83]Both entire teams have Aegis.
[19:16.35]Like a retreat I've got literally who is that I got sovereignty No boy fall back Nice no boy.
[19:23.78]Oh boy.
[19:24.18]Oh
[19:40.09]Watch out, they got enemies coming towards us, watch out!
[19:42.17]Enemies incoming!
[19:43.17]Loki behind behind.
[19:44.03]Watch out for Loki, watch out for Loki.
[19:47.05]He's to the left.
[19:48.79]Where?
[19:49.58]They're like trying to circle us around like sharks.
[19:52.16]Everybody stand right next to each other.
[19:53.98]I'm standing in the tower.
[19:55.60]Stand in the vortex so we can kill the minions as they come in.
[19:58.58]Oh he's back, he's back, he's left, he's right here.
[20:02.50]Okay, maybe that wasn't such a great idea.
[20:04.78]Sounded like a good idea.
[20:07.87]Wow.
[20:08.83]Three blocks, so I couldn't finish Zeus with my chains.
[20:11.55]I can't believe that heart bomb didn't finish him, that boy.
[20:13.23]We're gonna pull him in a second.
[20:17.13]Getting killed by Loki in 2.5 seconds.
[20:22.09]Oh, is he dead?
[20:24.33]Haha, got you with my heart bomb, Loki.
[20:26.05]I'm getting minions.
[20:27.41]That was nuts.
[20:32.43]We survived that.
[20:34.87]An enemy has been slain.
[20:36.81]Double kill.
[20:38.87]Triple kill.
[20:40.89]An ally has been slain.
[20:43.47]We're winning.
[20:44.09]Uh-oh, here it comes.
[20:45.23]I don't think so, Loki.
[20:48.87]I don't think so, Loki.
[20:54.01]Alright.
[20:58.09]So, 77 more points left to tick down.
[21:00.81]It's going pretty well.
[21:03.73]Ares wants a pull, but I've got Aegis.
[21:06.41]So he can deal with it.
[21:11.17]I don't think Ares has a pull.
[21:17.11]Oh, I hear Loki.
[21:18.59]He's on that Agni.
[21:22.98]I noticed.
[21:26.36]I think I saw that, yes.
[21:27.80]He's on that Agni.
[21:29.06]I felt that.

[23:19.79]They did, yeah.
[23:21.37]Yeah, it looks like it.
[23:23.01]Good game, good game.
[23:24.03]I will take 10 and 5 any day of the week.
[23:29.79]You just come up to me and you're like, hey, do you want 10 and 5?

[23:34.76]I would even take 10 and 5 on the weekend.
[23:37.46]Well, it is the weekend, so I would definitely take it then, too.
[23:41.30]Alright, well, it's been, what, two hours now?
[23:43.32]We've been playing some Smite.
[23:45.45]Been a lot of fun.
[23:46.63]Yeah, I know.
[23:47.09]It goes so fast, right?
[23:48.65]Wait, how long did you say?
[23:49.77]Two hours.
[23:51.47]Stop playing.
[23:53.48]What?
[23:54.30]Let me check.
[23:54.78]Stop lying.
[23:56.38]I think it says stop lying.
[23:58.24]Yeah, it's actually been two hours.
[24:00.34]It's been about 15, 20 minutes.
[24:03.28]Well, I mean, do we want to push our luck and do one more?
[24:05.52]Are you guys done or what?
[24:07.11]I might already be on another Warcraft.
[24:11.61]I got to grab some food.
[24:12.87]Alright, well, then that'll be the final game then.
[24:16.05]It was a good run.
[24:16.71]We only lost one or two out of like five.
[24:20.56]All I got to say is thank you, Edward Tallix, for letting us hang out.
[24:27.06]The great thing about Arena is being able to queue with whatever number you want, I think, is probably the best part about it, in my opinion.
[24:35.89]Yeah, good stream, guys.
[24:37.15]Thanks, everybody, who came out.
[24:38.17]Next week, I don't know what I'm going to be playing yet.
[24:40.51]Maybe I should do, like, Jerma and, like, start a vote.
[24:43.45]on things.
[24:44.71]Maybe I'll just, like, steal your idea and let people pick what I end up playing.
[24:49.53]But anyways, I will be streaming again next Saturday at 3 p.m.
[24:52.66]Central Standard Time, and of course, making tweets and announcements about it, so if you're not following me on Twitter or my Steam group, that's where I'll be announcing it.
[25:00.44]So, until next time, I'll see you guys then.
[25:04.98]What?
[25:06.28]Bless you, child!
[25:07.32]What if you, like, ruin an outro?
[25:12.52]Like top ten ways to ruin an outro.
[25:14.66]That's probably like number three.
[25:17.58]That's probably number three.
[25:20.65]Okay.
[25:21.17]People sneeze, alright?
[25:23.21]But anyways, guys, I will see you soon.
