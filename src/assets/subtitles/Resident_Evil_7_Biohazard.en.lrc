[01:08.41]Wait, what?
[01:17.14]Hi.
[01:19.00]Hi, guys.
[01:19.98]Hi.
[01:24.28]Sorry that I'm this late.
[01:26.96]I did not intend to.
[01:29.03]But that's what happens when you buy third party.
[01:33.94]And that's what also happens when you have to set up your entire PSVR.
[01:37.34]I thought it was just like you plug the fucking thing into the outlet, and that was it.
[01:41.06]Nope.
[01:43.48]The PSVR has its own tiny PlayStation 4.
[01:50.13]There's a small PlayStation 4 that comes in the box that you hook up to your PlayStation 4.
[01:54.75]I thought it was just plug-and-play, man.
[01:58.75]But I had a lot of shit happen.
[02:00.43]I had a lot of things to do today.
[02:01.95]And I'm sorry that I'm late.
[02:05.17]We're going now.
[02:08.85]Let's just... I'm just going to pull it over.
[02:10.23]Hold on.

[02:17.02]Hold on.
[02:17.92]Let me make sure it's not too loud.
[02:20.32]While I say hello to you guys.
[02:29.66]Please tell me it worked.
[02:31.16]Please tell me it worked.
[02:34.38]Did it work?
[02:37.46]Alright.

[02:54.53]I'm not ready to go yet.
[02:55.45]I need to put the helmet on.
[02:58.94]Is there any sound?
[03:02.68]Where's the audio?
[03:06.67]Okay, there it is.
[03:11.90]This game is not a safe feature.
[03:13.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah, it did not turn on.

[03:55.60]Options.
[03:56.74]Okay, here we go.

[05:14.28]Am I delayed talking to myself?
[05:17.57]Let's try to sing a song together.
[05:20.63]Are they clear of things that you might bump into?
[05:22.25]Alright, let's do a check.
[05:23.13]We're gonna do a check.
[05:23.85]You ready?
[05:25.27]Let's see if I bump into anything.
[05:27.83]Holy shit!
[05:30.33]Oh, I'm on the fucking rollercoaster!
[05:33.60]Alright, I think we're good.
[05:35.66]I don't think I'm gonna bump into anything.
[05:37.14]Unless it's the microphone, which I probably will.
[05:39.68]This is freaking me out, man.
[05:40.96]There's two of me on the screen!
[05:44.33]Alright, I think we're... Hold on.

[05:52.72]Hold on.
[05:54.36]Wait a second.
[05:56.04]Wait right there.
[05:57.42]Don't you fucking move.
[05:58.70]Stop fucking moving.
[06:02.62]Alright.
[06:03.30]There they are.
[06:11.18]There they are.
[06:11.86]I'm like so nervous right now.
[06:18.21]I can't fucking believe I'm doing this shit.
[06:19.75]I hope you're ready for VR.
[06:26.78]This is- I've never done VR ever in my whole life.
[06:31.98]Not one time.
[06:34.82]I did like a random demo at PAX East this past year and that's fucking it.
[06:42.14]Oh god, I hate having things in both of my fucking ears.
[06:47.65]Alright, well, good luck.
[06:52.36]I'll see you guys on the other side.
[06:53.82]Wait, what?
[06:56.46]How do I put this on?
[06:58.46]Wait, hold on, this is all fucked up.
[07:02.52]Come over here.
[07:03.88]I'm so sorry, I'm bumping into shit already.
[07:05.70]I didn't even read the instruction manual.
[07:09.10]Is that alright?
[07:09.86]That right there?
[07:11.52]This needs to be plugged in here.
[07:14.23]Where does this go?
[07:15.89]Where the fuck does this go?
[07:23.33]Where's my stereo audio go?
[07:28.10]What the fuck?
[07:33.50]Does anybody know where this goes?
[07:34.50]I don't see it.
[07:39.18]Don't hit the lampshade.
[07:42.92]I'm just going to press X. It's all clear.
[07:47.36]Oh, boy.
[07:49.94]Where does it go?
[07:50.46]I don't see a spot for it.
[07:58.53]In the controller?
[08:00.41]Wait, what?
[08:02.05]Up your ass.
[08:03.39]I don't think it goes up my ass.
[08:09.26]Hold on.
[08:10.54]Wait, what?
[08:15.77]I thought I got- hold on, where's my instruction manual?
[08:20.31]I'm gonna do the VR tutorial by the way, I ain't fucking around here.
[08:25.07]Plug it into the controller?
[08:26.65]That feels like it wouldn't even reach.
[08:28.35]Why is this so awkward?
[08:29.71]Look at this.
[08:30.85]What the fuck is going on here?
[08:33.16]This is like the most awkward thing I've ever seen.
[08:36.60]Never ask for- nah, I get the manual right here.
[08:39.70]I like spiked it into the ground because I was pissed off at it, but here we go.
[08:46.18]Okay, A, B. A. There it is!
[08:57.01]Got it!
[08:59.23]Got it.
[09:02.19]I'm delaying so fucking hard because I don't want to do this.
[09:06.41]Look at this fucking delay that I'm doing.
[09:10.20]I am so badly just stalling.
[09:15.40]I gotta stop fucking stalling and just get it over with.
[09:18.86]Okay, fuck me.
[09:19.96]Here we go.
[09:22.36]Ayayay.
[09:27.12]Let's go.
[09:33.33]Wait, what?
[09:35.73]Okay.
[09:37.51]I can't see.
[09:38.99]Can you guys see me still?
[09:41.41]Start the VR tutorial.
[09:44.44]I can't even tell if you guys even can see me.
[09:46.12]Where's my controller?
[09:48.50]Where's my controller?
[09:49.78]There it is.
[09:50.56]Hold on.
[09:52.00]Alright, you can change advanced settings and play the VR mode.
[09:54.26]Okay.
[09:56.32]Let's do it.
[09:58.48]How do I turn it up?
[10:00.16]How do I turn it up?
[10:01.42]Oh dear.
[10:02.00]Get yourself in a comfortable position and then hold.
[10:06.54]Can you guys see this on the screen?
[10:13.88]What do I do?
[10:14.52]Okay, comfortable.
[10:15.62]Holding options will register your current position.
[10:18.42]If you significantly change your posture and feel that the tracking is off, hold options are okay.
[10:23.66]There are red markings on the top, bottom, right, so yeah.
[10:31.31]Okay.
[10:33.21]Oh god, I'm gonna fucking die.
[10:39.53]Are you guys like seeing the camera move?
[10:44.22]Oh, okay.
[10:48.56]Oh, God.
[10:49.20]I don't know if I can do this.
[10:51.33]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this.
[10:53.97]Hold on.
[10:55.65]Hold on a second.
[10:58.25]I gotta turn this up.
[11:00.15]Right?
[11:01.03]This shit's gotta be loud.
[11:02.03]You know what I'm saying?
[11:03.30]Give me a second.
[11:04.96]I'm hearing noises already.
[11:09.28]Hold on.
[11:14.62]We'll go with like, we'll go with like 65%.
[11:22.59]Turn it up.
[11:29.21]Is that louder?
[11:30.07]Well, I can hear myself breathing.
[11:35.88]Okay.
[11:37.64]The white lines around you will give you a better understanding of distances in the virtual world around you.
[11:41.24]They can be turned on or off in the options menu.
[11:44.84]Use R to turn 30 degree intervals.
[11:46.46]Doing so is... You can turn by moving your head, but you can't turn as much as you'd like using R instead.
[11:58.07]Try moving to the three gull areas around you.
[12:04.71]How loud is it?
[12:05.43]Loud?
[12:09.92]Pushing R up will set your head's current facing direction as the default forward.
[12:13.60]Okay.
[12:13.70]Okay.
[12:19.73]Got it.
[12:28.91]There are many VR mode related settings and options once you've got used to VR mode.
[12:33.71]Okay.
[12:35.79]This is the end of the VR tutorial.
[12:39.27]Alright.
[12:40.15]Are you guys ready?
[12:41.49]You ready for this?
[12:43.25]Are you ready for this shit?

[13:51.65]I miss you so much.
[13:52.67]Oh, man.

[14:37.42]I just want to make sure.
[14:38.47]Before I get going, like, for real.
[14:41.07]Like, can you guys hear this shit?
[14:47.64]You guys can hear this shit, right?
[14:49.06]Hey, it's, uh, it's Ethan.
[14:50.80]Oh, hey.

[14:55.43]Yeah, no, I'm good.
[14:56.43]I'm good.
[14:58.13]It's good.
[14:58.45]Alright.
[14:59.81]She's not dead.
[15:00.41]She's alive.
[15:01.55]She's back.
[15:02.37]They found her?
[15:03.39]How?

[15:08.99]She's back somehow.
[15:10.01]Wait, what?
[15:11.27]Maybe it's a prank.
[15:13.07]She wants me to come and get her.
[15:14.48]Where is she?
[15:16.14]Dolphie.
[15:17.49]Alright, this is me in the car, right?
[15:29.97]How do I drive?
[15:34.41]Oh, this is a cutscene.
[15:35.29]This is just a cutscene, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:37.21]Don't worry.
[15:45.80]Oh my god, this is too much.

[21:57.19]Okay.
[21:57.47]What the fuck is it?
[22:00.38]Is this my... Mia's driver's license.
[22:04.74]It's covered in a strange black substance.
[22:13.45]I'm trying to, like, see closer.
[22:14.77]I can't.
[22:15.53]Okay, well, whatever.

[78:03.61]We drop down the trapdoor.
[78:05.64]Cause I can't, I get the key, but... Fuckin' hell.
[78:11.01]It is so hard to fucking concentrate on anything that's going on when you're inside this fucking game and inside this world.
[78:21.34]Like, it's fucking too real.
[78:25.42]If I was playing this, like, just with the controller in my hand, just looking at the screen, this would be fucking easy.
[78:32.42]But I'm fucking in the game in real life.
[78:36.33]It's a little more fucking difficult.

[79:16.98]So where did it put... Okay, right here.
[79:18.72]Good.
[79:19.12]Okay.
[79:21.80]It was handgun ammo.
[79:23.60]It's also fairly difficult to control in VR because I have to deal with this thing.
[79:30.77]And, like, looking around is... But, you know, this is fucking awesome.
[79:36.89]If you have a PSVR for some reason...
[79:40.79]And you want this... Ah, that's a... I thought that was a gun.
[79:44.19]I was looking at it like this.
[79:46.15]I was looking at it like this.
[79:48.61]That was a gun on the ground.
[79:50.75]Nope.
[79:51.35]It's just a fucking shoe.
[79:54.44]Great.
[79:55.86]Okay, so he's right there.
[79:56.80]So this right here can... Okay, the key is for this door.
[80:02.16]We gotta bait him, run around, grab the key, open that door, and get the fuck out of here.
[80:05.55]We got it.
[80:09.17]I missed handgunning.
[80:09.89]Where the hell was it?
[80:16.71]At this point, I kind of just want to get out of this area.
[80:19.39]Oh, the herb.
[80:19.95]Don't forget about the herb.
[80:23.15]Where was that handgun ammo in here?
[80:25.63]I'm going to open all these doors just because I need to run around in circles.
[80:31.30]Don't get lost in here.
[80:32.94]I can hide.
[80:35.68]I don't know where that handgun ammo was.
[80:36.96]I forget.
[80:37.44]I'm just too engrossed in this fucking crazy ass game.
[80:42.31]What about here?
[80:44.19]Looks fragile.
[80:44.67]Maybe you can break it with something.
[80:47.44]Garage.
[80:49.24]Shit, let's check down here first.
[80:51.26]Right?
[80:51.52]Might as well.
[80:54.68]Secure with a tape that can't be removed by hand.
[80:56.62]Okay.
[81:00.41]You got it?
[81:03.55]I guess I just have to get down there.
[81:05.25]So let's try it.
[81:05.87]Here we go.
[81:17.95]Maybe I can hide down there.
[81:18.71]Alright.
[81:25.97]A hiding place.
[81:26.53]What's a good hiding place?
[81:27.19]I don't know where he goes, though.
[81:28.19]That's the thing.
[81:28.59]I don't know where he goes.
[81:29.21]Let's go down here.
[81:29.73]I'm gonna hide down here.
[81:35.61]Like, he's not gonna come down here.
[81:42.93]Right?
[81:46.13]Right?
[81:54.81]Oh, I can hear him.
[82:45.21]Oh, yeah, you know.

[85:02.21]Time to go for it.
[85:02.89]Alright, get ready.
[85:03.69]We're fucking sprinting over there.
[85:06.99]He's in that room.
[85:09.33]He's in that fucking room.
[85:14.72]Who's, who's, huh?
[85:16.16]Who is?
[85:17.48]Who is it?
[85:26.70]I just gotta go open it.

[86:36.02]Open the door and get in!
[86:36.70]Open the door and get in!
[86:43.34]Oh my lord and fuck.
[86:53.25]Jesus.
[86:54.45]Make sure I didn't miss anything in here.
[87:09.34]Okay.
[87:11.18]We're safe.
[87:12.70]Close this again, please.
[87:16.92]Let's go.
[87:22.05]Alright, back at square one.
[87:30.37]Antique coin.
[87:31.17]Okay.
[87:32.93]Okay.
[88:03.80]What?
[88:06.74]Save point.
[88:09.77]Jesus.
[88:12.61]I like, I've like gone all the way over here.
[88:17.41]Damn.
[88:21.51]What is this underneath my father's castle?
[88:31.05]Oh my god.
[88:33.85]Checkpoint.
[88:34.33]We're good.
[88:35.05]We're good.
[88:35.73]Alright, back to the game.
[88:37.39]Let's do it, boys and girls.
[88:38.65]Let's tighten this shit up.
[88:47.36]And let's do the VR experience.
[88:54.04]Okay, I got the house map.
[88:55.02]Nice.
[88:55.92]Good.
[88:57.21]So where the hell am I now?
[89:00.12]Laundry room, kitchen, escape from the house.
[89:04.70]Okay.
[89:08.50]Well, there's only one way to go, and that's this way.
[89:10.72]Just give me a gun, please.
[89:14.38]Chemical fluid, combine items.
[89:16.47]Okay.
[89:22.99]Okay, so an herb and a chemical fluid is one healing potion, essentially.
[89:27.37]Okay.
[89:27.49]Okay.
[89:34.71]Okay.
[89:35.27]I actually really wanted to, like, put that at whatever.
[89:42.95]I did get fucked up by that guy, so maybe that wasn't a bad idea to just kill the full... What's in here?
[89:52.18]Can you open it?
[89:58.36]Open it up!
[89:59.54]Oh, there we go.
[90:03.86]Lockpick.
[90:05.58]I bet that'll come in handy.
[90:09.00]I unlocked it.
[90:14.06]Shut up.
[90:20.04]You did good, Ethan.
[90:21.42]Zoe, right?
[90:22.91]What the fuck are you?
[90:23.79]Shut up and listen if you want to stay alive.
[90:25.57]Live.
[90:25.67]You gotta get out of that house.
[90:28.32]There might be a way out through the main hall.
[90:30.22]Alright.
[90:30.92]Oh.
[90:31.62]And that thing on your wrist is a codex.
[90:33.62]Don't lose it.
[90:34.04]It's important.
[90:36.17]It's like too close to my face.
[90:37.47]That was too close to my face.
[90:41.91]What is in this?
[90:44.83]You can store items here.
[90:48.57]Well.
[90:51.15]I think I need a lot of that shit, don't I?
[90:52.83]Anything else?
[90:59.25]Okay, where's the main hall?
[91:01.53]Main house.
[91:02.07]So, main hall's over there.
[91:03.39]I gotta open that door.
[91:04.45]I just don't know where to go.
[91:16.03]That old lady's gone.
[91:16.93]Oh, wait a minute.
[91:19.60]Wait a minute.
[91:19.94]Wait a minute.
[91:20.44]Wait a second.
[91:22.36]What about over here?
[91:26.41]Can't use that.
[91:29.44]Can't use that.
[91:31.16]Damn it.
[91:31.60]I really thought the coin might have been able to go there.
[91:33.42]Alright, let's go back and look over here.
[91:40.99]Get the fuck out of the way.
[91:43.35]Get out of the way!
[91:44.01]Like, pressing my face up to it.
[91:57.72]I can't break it with my screwdriver?
[92:04.81]You tell me I can't rip this shit off with my screwdriver?
[92:14.19]Fuck.
[92:18.81]Well, where was I going to go?
[92:21.39]Let me go look over here while I have this.
[92:22.63]Actually, wait, wait, wait.
[92:23.25]This door.
[92:23.63]I couldn't open this before.
[92:25.91]Okay, Ken.
[92:26.99]Now this is the door I came in.
[92:29.54]There's the fucking underground lair.
[92:32.44]Look at the map again.
[92:34.68]What the fuck was that?
[92:35.50]What the fuck was... What's going on?
[92:36.74]What's happening?
[92:40.60]Video... Get out of here!
[92:41.82]Okay, right and then down.
[92:45.92]Maybe I can go that way.
[92:52.45]That's the garage.
[92:53.69]That's the main hall.
[92:55.77]Do I have something to open this now?
[93:01.78]Oh my god.
[93:05.92]The coin?
[93:09.22]Can't use that here.
[93:10.04]There's no keyhole.
[93:25.13]Is there anything actually down here?
[93:29.70]No.
[93:33.54]So where have I not been?
[93:34.46]I mean, the laundry room is a save point.
[93:40.03]Up the stairs, maybe?
[93:41.15]Yeah, okay, so if I go out, if I go straight... No, I can't get over there.
[94:07.49]Kitchen, pantry.
[94:08.39]Did I go in the pantry?
[94:10.09]Hey.
[94:13.72]What?
[94:14.66]Open up.
[94:15.06]What the fuck is he talking about?
[94:19.12]Open up what?
[94:19.60]Open up.
[94:20.38]There's a guy there.
[94:21.82]Hey, over here.
[94:27.17]Hey, you gotta help me.
[94:28.71]Hold on, back up.
[94:30.31]Now, sir, do you live here?
[94:32.61]I mean, is this your property?
[94:34.60]What?
[94:35.42]Me?
[94:35.58]No, no.
[94:37.28]Alright, now we got several calls about some missing persons.
[94:40.70]This guy's dead.
[94:42.02]I gotta get out of here.
[94:43.48]An axe is gonna come across and hit him in the face.
[94:45.34]You're not listening to me.
[94:46.58]There are crazy people in this house trying to fucking kill me.
[94:49.26]Well, alright, let me tell you this.
[94:51.17]You don't exactly seem like you're playing with a full deck yourself, alright?
[94:54.17]He's dead.
[94:54.53]You kidding me?
[94:55.21]Three, two, one.
[94:59.29]Dead.
[95:00.15]And I can't rule out that an outsider like yourself may not be involved.
[95:06.07]I'll tell you whatever you want.
[95:07.83]Alright.
[95:08.57]Now, that's more like it.
[95:09.73]Now, meet me in the garage.
[95:11.79]We'll talk later.
[95:13.01]Hey, wait.
[95:14.25]You gotta give me your gun.
[95:15.19]You must have lost your mind.
[95:19.91]Look, officer.
[95:21.96]Deputy.
[95:23.68]Right.
[95:24.76]Deputy.
[95:26.28]Now, you want to see my name in the obituaries, but you want to be a hero and save my life.
[95:31.36]Oh, I'm gonna, like, puke.
[95:32.08]Give me the gun.
[95:34.10]I will definitely take that gun.
[95:37.86]Oh.
[95:38.24]Oh.
[95:43.49]Well, I can open up shit.
[95:44.67]Dude, this is gonna turn to be one of those things where this guy's in on it, too.
[95:50.55]Yeah, that guy's in on it, too.
[95:56.16]He's gonna... I'm gonna open the door, and he's gonna be like, Ha ha, I told you not to open that door.
[96:04.46]Cool.
[96:15.00]Well, that works too.
[96:16.68]At least I have a weapon now.
[96:21.65]God damn.
[96:30.92]We gotta get the fuck out of here.
[96:31.94]Now, first you need to tell me what you're doing out here alone in the middle of the night.
[96:35.36]Me?
[96:36.06]What about you?
[96:36.60]Now, it's my job.
[96:37.20]Why don't you do your job and tell me?
[96:39.37]Answer my questions.
[96:40.45]You're not gonna believe me if I told you.
[96:41.91]I'm trying.
[96:42.41]Hey, hey, look.
[96:43.51]Hey, what'd they do to him?
[96:45.21]What'd they do to him?
[96:47.01]Wait!
[96:47.17]I knew it.
[96:47.53]I told you he was dead.
[96:48.99]I told you he was dead.
[96:49.86]Fucking stab him.
[96:55.30]Stab him.
[97:02.38]Woo-hoo!
[97:08.46]Oh.
[97:09.56]How do I get out of here?
[97:11.72]Give me his gun!
[97:12.32]Give me his gun!
[97:13.68]I gotta get his gun.

[97:44.60]This is fucking ridiculous.
[97:50.34]This is fucking ridiculous.
[98:20.31]It's like driving around full speed in a garage.
[98:24.53]What a fucking psycho.
[98:26.77]What a psycho.
[98:43.98]Why would you ever do something like that?
[98:45.84]Why would you ever do that?
[98:48.90]Why would you ever do that?
[98:52.53]I can't get over that.
[98:56.49]How do I skip?
[98:58.99]I'm gonna see him die again.
[98:59.84]I'm gonna get close.
[99:00.38]Alright, real close.
[99:14.76]I can't look!
[99:16.68]Oh, it's too gruesome!

[102:30.26]Alright.
[102:32.72]Main hall.
[102:34.26]I'm in the garage right now.
[102:36.58]I gotta get to the main hall.
[102:43.24]Let me make sure I don't miss anything here.
[102:44.62]Anything in the fucking driver's seat or anything?
[102:48.88]No, I don't think so.
[102:50.97]Not that I can tell.
[102:51.67]There we go.
[102:55.93]First aid.
[102:56.53]How am I on health?
[102:57.95]I wish I could see that better.
[103:00.37]It's hard to see that.
[103:02.67]I can't open the garage door.
[103:03.93]There we go.
[103:07.51]I can go up.
[103:13.09]Fuck!
[103:31.68]Does he have anything on him?
[103:33.96]You don't have anything on you?
[103:36.17]Chem fluid.
[103:39.49]Jesus Christ!
[103:46.88]Wow.
[103:47.44]Wow.
[103:50.00]Wow.

[103:57.88]When is there gonna be a shotgun?
[104:04.21]Ooh!
[104:04.71]I know what I need this for!
[104:07.75]This goes in the door to get to the main hall, just like any other Resident Evil game ever made.
[104:16.07]Can I get it?
[104:16.87]Hello?
[104:18.63]Awk statue.
[104:20.15]Got it.
[104:28.91]Yikes.
[104:31.03]Okay.
[104:32.63]Now I should be able to just get out of here, right?
[104:37.64]Yeah, I think so.
[104:39.92]Alright.
[104:40.96]Let's go open up the door.
[104:42.06]Let's hope we don't get attacked by another one of the insane family members.
[104:46.39]That'd be nice.
[104:47.73]At least I have a fucking gun.
[104:50.75]It's been too long without this gun in this crazy house.
[104:53.65]Too long.
[104:57.61]Well, you could... Shotgun... Can I store shit here?
[105:03.78]Alright, so I can bring out the... The knife is left.
[105:09.04]Up and left.
[105:09.64]Okay.
[105:09.96]Let's keep the gun out.
[105:12.02]Let's go open that door.
[105:23.27]I'm waiting for someone's fucking hand to jump out from right there.
[105:30.44]Work statue.
[105:33.00]Get in there.
[105:33.48]Fuck me.
[105:44.92]Fuck me.
[105:56.25]Damn.
[105:58.25]This is elaborate.
[106:00.33]Main hall we can go.
[106:01.31]Let's try to the right first.
[106:02.59]Let's look at the table and make sure nothing's here that I need.
[106:05.33]I don't think I can do anything here.
[106:10.33]Shotgun.
[106:20.07]Shotgun!
[106:25.24]Shotgun!
[106:27.56]Didn't I get shotgun shells?
[106:31.46]Only one shotgun shell.

[106:40.40]Thank you, Walt Disney.
[106:46.04]Alright, let's... What do you mean it's locked?
[106:48.06]Hit.
[106:54.34]Fuck.
[107:01.24]I need to replace this with something, obviously.
[107:05.24]Gonna have to come back later.
[107:11.56]Any other doors?
[107:12.92]Yeah, this one back here.
[107:18.75]Coin?
[107:23.51]What?
[107:28.31]What am I doing?

[107:33.33]L and R is rotate and okay.
[107:36.26]Oh, okay, I see.
[107:42.56]What is it trying to do?
[107:43.48]I have to like make this coin do something on the wall over there?
[107:58.16]I'm gonna assume I don't know what that is.
[107:59.76]Sky, what's it called?
[108:00.68]Sky what?
[108:05.87]Well, we'll figure that out later.
[108:14.53]Sky Hunter.
[108:16.56]Okay.
[108:19.28]Sky Hunter.
[108:24.56]Tighten it a little.
[108:27.52]That's better.
[108:28.78]That's better.
[108:33.72]Um...
[108:36.43]Looks like we're gonna go over here.
[108:41.03]Over 20 missing in two years.
[108:42.47]Yeah, Captain Hollow from State Police Hill reporters.
[108:44.31]There's a bunch of people missing.
[108:46.58]There sure are people missing.
[108:51.32]Clock pendulum.
[108:52.56]Oh, I gotta bring that back to the other room.
[108:56.28]You got it.
[108:59.36]Scorpion.
[109:01.96]That clock pendulum's gotta be brought back
[109:12.50]Where's the fucking phone?
[109:14.84]Another coin.
[109:21.49]Oh, two coins now.
[109:22.33]Alright.
[109:22.81]Coins.
[109:24.19]Cool.
[109:25.57]Where's that phone?
[109:29.69]There it is.
[109:34.05]Yeah?
[109:35.21]Did my daddy give you a hard time?
[109:37.21]That's your father?
[109:38.89]Who are you speaking to?
[109:40.47]Okay.
[109:40.89]Okay.
[110:00.15]Nice and cryptic, just the way I like it.
[110:01.89]Okay.
[110:03.77]Can't go that way.
[110:05.75]But... This is locked.
[110:09.79]Nothing I can do about that.
[110:11.14]Okay.
[110:13.26]Up the stairs we go!
[110:14.78]Although I have two coins.
[110:16.86]I guess I could just put them there and see what happens.
[110:22.45]Do I need more than one, or is it just this one?
[110:26.83]I don't know.
[110:28.80]I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking at with that.
[110:31.85]But, you know.
[110:35.03]Probably we'll figure that out later.
[110:36.15]Oh, shit.
[110:44.51]This is... This is right here.
[110:47.45]Okay, let's put the pendulum on the clock.
[110:57.38]Let's do clock two.
[111:11.24]Alright, let's do it.
[111:18.01]White dog head.
[111:21.63]That's annoying.
[111:22.21]Alright, I got one piece of it.
[111:27.05]Let's go up the stairs now and see what we can find.
[111:36.55]Actually, did I want to... Was there anything else I couldn't do in here?
[111:40.61]No.
[111:43.36]I really should save the game.
[111:45.24]But, you know, fuck it, right?
[111:47.00]Who cares?
[111:47.38]Let's go up the stairs.
[111:54.15]Although, maybe I can put this in here right now.
[111:55.39]Yeah, I can.
[112:01.12]One of the three dog heads is now in place.
[112:12.05]Chem fluid.
[112:14.15]Let's combine some of these.
[112:15.27]Do I have any herbs?
[112:19.79]Yeah, I do.
[112:24.58]Consolidate a little bit here.
[112:29.74]Shotgun, staircase.
[112:30.90]Let's go up.
[112:38.96]Wait, what do I do?
[112:39.54]Should I shoot first, ask questions later?
[112:42.35]What do you think?
[112:57.56]Okay.
[112:58.58]Essentially harmless.
[112:59.76]Essentially harmless.
[113:01.89]No, she's gonna have a Satan face.
[113:03.51]Guaranteed.
[113:05.21]Fucking guaranteed she's gonna be behind me.
[113:07.07]Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[113:07.93]Come follow me.
[113:11.17]You fucking old lady in the goddamn wheelchair.
[113:13.75]Get out of here.
[113:17.11]Oh, Tom Brady's helmet.
[113:17.95]Is there anything on it that I need to know?
[113:25.18]Like his number or... Anything at all?
[113:56.11]And gun ammo.
[114:03.58]Shotgun shells.
[114:04.26]I got four now.
[114:05.20]Five.
[114:05.60]You count the one I already have.
[114:16.02]Can't do anything there.
[114:19.02]Chem fluid.
[114:30.58]Christ.
[114:34.63]There's just black fluid in here.
[114:38.97]Wooden statuette.
[114:40.09]Okay.
[114:45.08]I feel like that's for the puzzle downstairs with the coin.
[114:52.00]More handgun ammo.
[114:52.78]I'm gonna have to use this pretty soon.
[114:56.46]If I were to take a guess... Toilet.
[114:59.90]Antique coin in the toilet.
[115:06.68]I think we're good to go.
[115:15.63]Lots of rooms to look at out here.
[115:23.95]Oh, his hand is right in my eye!
[115:28.65]My little girl has given us a gift.
[115:31.55]And this gift will last forever.
[115:33.56]Fuck.
[115:37.02]Whoa!
[115:38.74]As you prefer.
[115:42.34]Which in a word... Uh... Uh... Oh, how the fuck are you right behind me right now?
[115:49.75]How are you right behind me?
[115:50.89]It's not possible.
[115:52.75]Close the door.
[116:06.77]Come on.
[116:07.67]Come on.
[116:08.63]Come on.
[116:09.69]Come on.
[116:10.71]Wait a minute!
[116:11.35]Wait a minute!
[116:11.77]I told you.
[116:14.83]Don't you fuck with me.
[116:19.41]I thought he was gonna be right behind me.
[116:40.56]Run!
[116:40.84]Gotta run, need to reload.
[117:07.64]Can I take his fucking tooth break away from him, please?
[117:14.18]Son of a Jesus.
[117:23.59]I'm gonna use that.
[117:24.55]I don't have anything to open this with.
[117:31.45]Okay, grandma's room.
[117:34.73]Let's go to grandma's room.
[117:38.30]Okay.
[117:41.18]Anything in here?
[117:41.84]There's a TV in here.
[117:42.75]Another VHS called Mia.
[117:49.65]Oh, I need a second.
[117:54.91]I need a minute.
[117:56.83]Okay.
[118:00.36]No heal, no block Resident Evil 7 run?
[118:02.64]Alright.
[118:08.21]Here we go.
[118:13.91]Sometimes I just gotta come out of this thing.
[118:15.45]It's like coming up for air.
[118:16.46]It's like oxygen.
[118:26.60]That works.
[118:27.69]That's good.
[118:28.83]Okay.
[118:31.77]Let's watch this tape.
[118:32.59]Mia.
[118:38.02]Oh, stressful.
[118:40.31]Ethan, please watch this.
[118:44.39]Okay.
[118:45.49]What do you think I'm doing?
[118:46.93]Mia?
[118:57.09]Yeah?
[118:59.71]It's going to be one of those interactive things when I have to follow people around and be scared.
[119:10.67]Ethan, if you find this, I know I can't expect anything from you.
[119:16.33]Not after what happened.
[119:17.90]After what I did.
[119:19.80]But I just want you to know that wasn't me.
[119:22.96]I don't know what happened.
[119:26.14]There's so much that you need to know.
[119:27.91]There you are.
[119:29.15]You gave us quite a scare, young lady.
[119:39.69]Oh, wait, it's me.
[119:42.73]I have to be her?
[119:43.49]Oh, that's creepy.
[119:48.98]Babies, yeah.
[119:50.64]Very, very, very, very good here.
[119:52.90]Okay, what's that?
[119:57.80]She just kind of keeps going.
[119:59.54]Can I jump down?
[120:01.25]No.
[120:08.29]Where am I supposed to be going?
[120:13.96]Hey!
[120:14.62]What the fuck?
[120:17.52]Oh, God.
[120:19.10]Oh, God.
[120:21.72]Over here, mommy.
[120:23.07]What?
[120:31.35]Oh, don't start saying mommy and shit.
[120:34.89]I'm not prepared for that.
[120:36.13]That's not something I can pick up.
[120:48.00]Whoa!
[120:48.38]What?
[120:49.54]What?
[120:50.00]This is where we go.
[121:17.07]For the love of God.
[121:19.53]For the love of God.
[121:21.17]It hurts.
[121:22.47]It fucking hurts.
[121:24.23]It hurts.
[121:42.50]Can I crouch?
[121:43.52]I guess maybe I can just...
[121:51.64]I need to hide.
[121:53.44]I need to hide.
[121:54.02]Is this a good hiding spot?
[121:58.38]What have I done to deserve this?
[122:00.74]Except open my home and feed you.
[122:07.49]I don't understand you at all.
[122:19.34]This is me.
[122:23.60]Bye.
[122:24.72]What the fuck is this?
[122:34.73]Wait a minute.
[122:35.87]Wait a minute.
[122:37.39]Wait a minute.
[122:38.65]Hold on a second.
[122:39.25]Wait a minute.
[122:40.11]This is the... I gotta remember this.
[122:42.45]Screenshot it.
[122:43.29]Somebody screenshot that.
[122:44.77]Somebody get a screenshot.
[122:47.33]Somebody... Somebody get a... What is that?
[122:49.78]What did I get?
[122:51.14]What's going on?
[122:53.78]Put it down.
[122:54.52]Put it down.
[122:56.00]Put it down.
[123:00.33]Oh, fuck.
[123:01.51]Oh, no.
[123:03.63]I'm fucking dead again.
[123:04.87]Don't come over here.
[123:15.02]Don't come over here.
[123:17.00]Don't come over here.
[123:36.44]That's what I said!
[123:38.34]That's what I just said.
[123:39.31]That's what I just said.
[123:41.15]Don't come over here.
[123:48.07]What?
[123:59.86]Can I...
[124:04.29]Fucking shove her.
[124:04.97]Shove her.
[124:05.43]Shove her.
[124:05.85]Shove her.
[124:06.51]Shove her, right?
[124:07.42]Push her down the...
[124:37.65]I was gonna, like, fucking push her over the edge!
[124:50.03]Let's go.
[124:52.47]I'll get it this time, don't worry.
[124:53.91]I wanna just, like, throw her over the edge.
[124:59.75]Don't worry, it's gonna put me, like, right there, it's gonna be fine.
[125:07.17]And if it doesn't, then fuck.
[125:14.41]Fucking virtual reality.
[125:17.22]Yeah, see, we're right here.
[125:18.06]We're good.
[125:18.58]Yeah, we're right here.
[125:19.70]We're good to go.
[125:26.52]So I can't... No, don't go that way.
[125:27.68]I just want to see what was over there.
[125:30.78]Get out of the... Get out of the way.
[125:32.03]Door.
[125:32.45]Door, get the fuck out of the way.
[125:36.78]Like, I wish I could do something with this.
[125:38.12]Can I shoot her with this?
[125:40.21]Take it and shoot her!
[125:41.07]Alright, so I need to map this out.
[125:45.55]So we're going... Out, out, out.
[125:49.19]Okay.
[125:53.78]Sneak by.
[126:02.38]She comes out here, sneak around...
[126:07.32]And get in... Just get away from her.
[126:12.41]Here she comes.
[126:19.21]Stay here.
[126:20.63]Do not fuck this up.
[126:24.84]Here we go.
[126:34.18]Wait till I can see her.
[126:40.05]What are you doing?
[126:40.47]Don't- What are you doing?
[126:41.81]Don't come over here!
[126:42.61]Shhh!

[127:22.45]What the fuck happened there?
[127:23.53]What?
[127:23.79]I can't get out?
[127:27.74]What the fuck?
[127:32.00]I can't go anywhere else.
[127:37.96]This door doesn't open.
[127:38.72]Do I have to follow her in there?
[127:47.22]I'm so confused right now.
[127:49.86]No other doors open.
[128:06.33]What?
[128:08.08]I just did this shit.
[128:09.10]I don't understand.
[128:09.88]Why can't I get out of here?
[128:16.16]Oh, wait a minute.
[128:16.86]Okay.
[128:22.68]It's a spider.
[128:23.18]It's got to be a spider.
[128:24.19]Make it a spider.
[128:25.15]Just like that.
[128:25.63]A little bit more to the left.
[128:27.17]A little bit more to the right.
[128:28.43]No.
[128:29.19]Like right here.
[128:30.39]Right there.
[128:41.40]Get out.
[128:51.27]Why is it going black?
[128:56.85]Is that me, like, blinking?
[128:57.89]I don't understand.
[128:58.53]The hand's gonna come out.
[129:02.99]Oh, a fucking hand's gonna come out right here.

[129:57.50]Jesus Christ!
[129:59.60]There are known unknowns here, and you are not paying fucking attention!
[130:07.53]Jesus!
[130:09.61]You think little Evie's gonna put up with your shit forever, bitch?
[130:24.89]I can't.
[130:34.75]I can't.
[130:36.26]I can't.
[130:37.40]Where am I going?
[130:38.04]Straight to the right?
[130:39.58]Okay.
[130:44.10]Here we go.
[130:46.10]We're going straight to the right.
[130:48.71]Here we go, as Super Mario once said.
[130:56.93]Fucking hell.
[130:58.13]What the fuck is that?
[130:59.79]Who's that?
[131:21.88]Oh no.
[131:25.49]Where do you think you're going?
[131:43.60]Goddamn.
[131:49.98]I need to take like a breather here.
[131:53.80]I gotta, like, look at my phone.
[132:01.06]Mission failed?
[132:01.70]No, mission not failed.
[132:08.13]Damn.
[132:13.51]Zombie Grandpa is gonna be right behind him, I bet.
[132:17.15]I don't know.
[132:20.17]You're going through a lot right now.
[132:22.55]He looks like he's been crying.
[132:23.81]Yeah, you guys can't even tell.
[132:25.19]Like, I've been crying under here.
[132:29.61]Your face is red and your eyes are watering.
[132:32.15]No, we don't take any breaks.
[132:34.27]Unless we have to pee.
[132:38.39]I want to go for at least, like, three hours.
[132:42.44]We ain't stopping for at least three hours.
[132:44.44]Hold on, I think we need to reset this here.
[132:46.16]There you go.
[132:48.89]Three hours, and then we'll see how I feel.
[132:55.29]This has been fucking awesome, though, so far.
[133:04.72]This shit has taken a fairly long time to load.
[133:08.68]Here we go.
[133:10.50]Okay, what was I doing?
[133:16.32]Grandma's room.
[133:17.52]Alright, grandma's room.
[133:20.12]Can I get into grandma's there again?
[133:22.24]I don't have any keys or anything.
[133:35.67]Can't get into grandma's room.
[133:39.09]Fucking grandma.
[133:39.79]Alright.
[133:42.27]Looks like we can go up and we got to go to the master bedroom, right?
[133:47.04]Yeah.
[133:48.78]Master bedroom and storage over there we have not gone to.
[133:52.82]So we gotta go just out through that door and then around.
[133:57.15]Let's go.
[134:00.17]I got nine bullets.
[134:03.71]Move that piece of shit hippie we caught from the hall to the processing area.
[134:19.25]A giant book.
[134:20.99]Blue dog's head, eh?
[134:21.87]There's another one.
[134:24.17]Need one more.
[134:31.06]Gunpowder.
[134:31.64]Okay, I'm going to assume that gunpowder can be used for something, right?
[134:38.08]Storm's coming.
[134:40.32]Whatever.
[134:46.02]Trash.
[134:48.62]Okay, let's go.
[134:54.34]Straight through here.
[134:55.02]There's that creepy dude's trailer.
[135:03.48]And we wanna go this way.
[135:13.53]Oh, you motherfucker, how are you awake again?
[135:15.71]How are you awake again?
[135:23.51]Which way is he gonna... I only have nine bullets.
[135:29.66]I gotta run.
[135:30.26]I gotta outrun this guy.
[135:34.64]Shit.
[135:36.14]Go.
[135:37.14]Right now.
[135:38.86]Wait, let's see what he does.
[135:44.90]Go.
[135:51.30]Yeah, this way.
[136:02.16]Master bedroom.

[138:16.24]He's gonna be like, well, there you are, you little shit.
[138:19.39]I told you I was gonna catch up to you sooner or later.
[138:23.43]I've died five fucking times already.
[138:28.56]You psycho... Psychostimulants to find items.
[138:33.41]What?
[138:34.83]The fuck are you talking about?
[138:36.01]They're giving me lots of ammo.
[138:41.43]You know what that means, usually.
[138:48.68]Box.
[138:49.18]Shit.
[138:52.78]Shit.
[138:54.94]Item detection.
[138:55.72]I got a lot of this stuff.
[138:56.60]I need herbs.
[138:57.18]I don't have a screwdriver.
[139:03.42]Damn it.
[139:08.99]Can't get into that.
[139:10.33]Oh well.
[139:11.67]Hopefully nothing important is in there.
[139:12.87]Did you hear that?
[139:35.90]Whoa!
[139:36.52]What the fuck is that thing?
[139:38.51]It's like a death wraith!
[139:45.85]Is it dead?
[139:50.63]Is that thing dead?
[139:53.94]I hope that thing is dead.
[139:54.98]Is it dead?
[139:56.20]Are you dead?
[140:00.72]You're dead, right?
[140:02.00]You're dead.
[140:02.42]Okay, he's dead.
[140:33.00]Let's just see what I need to do here.
[140:34.14]There's definitely... There's gonna be a scorpion key.
[140:39.64]Guaranteed.
[140:40.26]Just don't have it yet.
[140:44.53]Let's try here first.
[140:56.45]I have not saved my game in a long time.
[140:58.17]Thank God.
[141:01.15]Thank God.
[141:06.09]Overwrite the save data.
[141:07.09]Yes, I do.
[141:12.61]Of course, there's a Scorpion King.
[141:20.20]So how does this look for you?
[141:21.14]I mean, I didn't even consider like what this actually looked like for you guys.
[141:28.31]I guess it looks like pretty interesting, I guess.
[141:31.43]That's weird.
[141:32.61]I'm looking at it from the OBS perspective.
[141:37.68]That's really weird looking.
[141:40.86]Immersion broken.
[141:43.54]Yeah, oh well.
[141:44.66]Alright, here we go.
[141:47.36]Here we go!
[141:50.23]Sometimes I gotta come up for air.
[141:53.85]But let's keep going.
[142:02.36]I need, like, a key.
[142:03.15]I gotta store some shit.
[142:04.11]I have way too many things.
[142:05.69]Alright, let's get rid of... this.
[142:15.35]Psycho... Mia.
[142:16.93]I gotta get rid of the videotape from Mia.
[142:18.59]I don't think I need that right now.
[142:23.32]I don't know.
[142:23.86]I know... What the fuck do these coins even do?
[142:28.43]I have no idea what the coins are even for.
[142:31.83]I'm gonna put them away for now.
[142:33.68]If I need them, I just come back.
[142:35.16]Okay, that's better.
[142:40.28]What is this?
[142:43.84]Okay.
[142:46.45]Wait, what did that say?
[142:50.18]It must be something... It must be that shit they made me eat.
[142:54.18]If I'm gonna die, I'd at least like to go out fighting.
[142:57.74]I'm gonna get a hold of that shotgun I saw in the rec room and make them regret what they did to me.
[143:02.24]You need to get out of here.
[143:03.16]I love you, Courtney.
[143:06.42]I knew that there was a shotgun in the rec room already.
[143:10.06]But thank you for your concern.
[143:11.50]Handgun ammo.
[143:15.59]We're full.
[143:16.93]That...
[143:21.77]Okay, let's go.
[143:26.03]Down the stairs.
[143:29.48]Down the stairs, yeah.
[143:34.98]Right, there we go.
[143:39.54]Whoops.
[143:43.63]Another fucking slime monster, guarantee it.
[143:52.00]Lord um try this door first why not try this one first lock from the other side Don't you do it
[144:22.22]Don't you do it to me.
[144:23.44]What the fuck are you?
[144:37.59]These things remind me of the Regenerators from Resident Evil 4.
[144:40.79]Those enemies are the worst.
[144:42.25]I fucking hate the Regenerators.
[144:46.30]They look exactly like them.
[145:15.88]Shit.
[145:17.26]Can I climb in there?
[145:31.45]Tomorrow.
[145:33.31]Tomorrow, Sean... William... Laura...
[145:47.52]Travis.
[145:49.30]Travis.
[145:51.10]Travis don't want to open.
[145:53.08]Okay.
[145:55.94]Whatever you say, Travis.
[145:56.90]Can I get in there?
[145:57.90]I can't, like, climb in?
[146:04.24]I don't know.
[146:07.48]I mean, you'd figure I'd be able to climb through there, but I guess not.
[146:16.52]I'm sweating right now.
[146:18.20]It's fucking insane how much I'm sweating.
[146:20.62]What is that?
[146:31.51]Look, as I caught the guy who keeps trying to escape, I've locked him up in the leftmost incinerator so he can't get away.
[146:37.71]Take him out when he's ready.
[146:39.97]You know how to open the door, don't you?
[146:41.27]Just remember, three A's and a handprint.
[146:44.87]Do what you want with this girl.
[146:51.67]Three A's and a handprint.
[146:59.63]Let's see here.
[147:06.25]Three A's and a handprint.
[147:08.73]There's an A in this name.
[147:09.73]There's an A in that name.
[147:12.98]There's an A in that name.
[147:22.83]Three A's and a handprint.
[147:24.49]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[147:25.27]Okay, hold on.
[147:25.63]That has two A's.
[147:26.35]So there's one, two.
[147:30.55]Close this one up.
[147:31.39]That's one, two, three.
[147:32.97]Right?
[147:33.57]No, close this one.
[147:35.23]Alright, so that's one, two, three, handprint.
[147:42.41]Okay.
[147:43.36]So just open this one.
[147:45.44]That should open now.
[147:46.34]Okay.
[147:47.42]No.
[147:51.62]Close that.
[147:55.13]Maybe this is the third A. Lara.
[148:01.17]Three A's in a handprint.
[148:02.23]Isn't that what I just did?
[148:05.62]William.
[148:07.32]Sean.
[148:12.28]Right?
[148:14.64]Travis has an A?
[148:17.50]Yeah, I know.
[148:20.03]I can't open Travis, though.
[148:21.05]It says it's locked.
[148:32.71]Alright.
[148:33.85]William, Sean.
[148:38.63]One, two, three.
[148:39.63]Okay, that's three A's.
[148:41.13]There we go.
[148:45.25]That's it.
[148:45.87]Got it.
[148:51.06]Whoa!
[148:56.50]Out of ammo.
[148:57.72]Out of ammo, Travis.
[148:59.08]Out of fucking ammo.
[149:00.65]Wonderful.
[149:07.91]I don't know where I'm going.
[149:11.97]What the fuck was that?
[149:13.09]Block it!
[149:50.52]Did you guys hear a gunshot?
[150:02.31]I swear to god I heard a fucking gunshot.
[150:07.99]I gotta go back and see if there's anything in that room.
[150:16.79]Anything that was a strong chem fluid.
[150:19.65]I don't have any herbs.
[150:30.38]Dissection room key.
[150:33.48]That works.
[150:34.69]That works for me.
[150:35.61]I need ammo so bad.
[150:40.89]Alright, let's try over here.
[150:46.21]No, it's locked on the other side.
[150:48.13]We're gonna go this way.
[150:53.13]Item room.
[151:01.42]Thank god.
[151:02.96]Processing area map.
[151:05.34]There's an herb.
[151:07.46]I hear somebody.
[151:22.00]Not yet.
[151:22.32]I don't want to go in there yet.
[151:23.30]Let's see if there's anything else in here.
[151:24.46]Can I get my fucking hand out of the way?
[151:38.93]Okay, I have a strong first aid.
[151:42.55]Okay.
[151:48.07]Lockpick.
[151:50.29]Treasure photo.
[151:53.89]What the hell was that?
[151:55.40]Treasure photo?
[151:58.38]Ah, scorpion key!
[151:59.38]Perfect.
[152:01.96]Exactly what we needed.
[152:08.16]Can still go this way.
[152:09.95]Just keep going.
[152:11.47]I can turn around if I need to.
[152:15.09]Don't have enough space.
[152:24.49]I hit something nice here.
[152:25.63]Try to find it if you can.
[152:26.81]It looks like a fireplace.
[152:29.87]Remember what that looks like.
[152:30.79]How do I?
[152:33.69]Just delete it.
[152:36.75]Do you guys have a screenshot of that?
[152:38.09]You'll know what it looks like.
[152:53.94]Shotgun shells.
[152:55.04]I need that fucking shotgun.
[153:00.44]Doesn't fit this lock.
[153:03.08]Really.
[153:05.67]Was that a snake key?
[153:16.51]Whatever.
[153:17.07]I'm gonna go back.
[153:17.57]I have that scorpion key now, and I want to open up that other door that I didn't go into, which is over here.
[153:42.75]God in VR this is so fucking hard to aim.
[153:45.87]Oh my god It's so hard to shoot this guy
[153:54.85]With my face!
[153:55.67]I have to, like... God damn it.
[154:04.55]What's my health look like?
[154:05.94]Oh, God.
[154:13.50]No!
[154:13.94]No!
[154:14.14]I don't have any ammo!
[154:15.06]I can't fight this guy!
[154:16.34]I can't fight this fucking guy!
[154:17.36]I gotta run!
[154:25.83]Fucking hell, man!
[154:32.73]You stupid person!
[154:34.98]You stupid person!
[154:52.29]Alright, I'm gonna go to this workshop.
[155:04.86]It's locked on the other side.
[155:06.04]What?
[155:11.86]What the fuck was that?
[155:27.19]No.
[155:27.43]No.
[155:28.45]No.
[155:29.75]No.
[155:36.37]Oh, no.
[155:39.11]Not another one.
[155:49.79]I'm kind of getting lost right now, guys.
[155:53.29]I just want to go open this scorpion door.
[155:54.87]Just run.
[156:04.67]Where am I?
[156:06.48]Where the fuck- No!
[156:10.72]No way!
[156:11.96]No way!
[156:12.70]No how!
[156:20.10]What do these buttons do?
[156:22.22]Do I even have the key?
[156:23.28]Is this a- Fuck me!
[156:27.02]Fuck me!
[156:28.34]Fuck me!
[156:29.76]Fuck!
[156:54.38]I don't know if it's the right key.
[156:55.67]I probably isn't.
[156:59.91]Stupid fucking god asshole!
[157:11.51]Okay, I can't go that way, I guess.
[157:14.99]Ugh.
[157:17.59]Let me open this locker real quick.
[157:24.01]Stupid.
[157:30.00]Look at this shit.
[157:33.08]I'm like destroyed right now.
[157:37.00]Oh my god, look at my fucking hair.
[157:38.96]Look at this.
[157:39.46]This is like a broken person.
[157:42.50]I'm so fucked up right now.
[157:47.31]I have like hat hair times five right now.
[157:53.91]Jesus.
[157:55.88]Well, I mean, I guess I'm going to take a break.
[157:58.72]I'm just going to go take a pee and get a drink and remember who the fuck I am as a human being.
[158:05.32]I will be right back.
[158:06.34]I'll see you guys in like five minutes.
[158:12.16]BRB.
[160:47.11]okay so did somebody say my audio went out of sync it should no well I have just a minute here I'm gonna just hang out and just chill for like a few minutes or so I'm gonna take a little break right now I mean I I don't know I start to get a little bit of a headache but it's okay I'm gonna keep going for like at least another 30 or 40 minutes but um am I out of sync
[161:20.08]It's a little bit out of sync.
[161:21.14]I don't know how this keeps fucking happening.
[161:25.18]Canvas slightly behind.
[161:26.46]I don't know why it would be.
[161:35.21]It's synced again?
[161:35.95]It is synced?
[161:41.35]Oh, okay.
[161:44.61]Not anymore?
[161:45.13]Maybe it's something to do when they're both going at the same time.
[161:47.56]I don't know.
[161:52.17]Do it without the head machine?
[161:55.17]Well, the whole point is that I have the head machine on.
[162:02.94]Just refreshed a few times and it fixed it.
[162:06.44]I just want to see it.
[162:07.16]I'm just curious.
[162:10.72]Yeah, this is fucking intense, guys.
[162:13.30]It is like crazy.
[162:14.87]I'm having a blast.
[162:16.73]The only problem with stuff like this, though, is...
[162:19.61]I feel like I really do need to take a long break here soon.
[162:23.73]Because just walking up the stairs, it was kind of hard to do.
[162:28.66]I felt like I was in a game again.
[162:30.80]Let me just look at this.
[162:31.92]This is fucking intense, guys.
[162:34.22]It is like crazy.
[162:35.78]I'm having a blast.
[162:37.64]The only problem with stuff like this, though, is I feel like I really do need to take a long break here soon.
[162:45.62]It's NSYNC for me.
[162:46.80]I don't know.
[162:48.54]Just wanted to make sure it was NSYNC on my end.
[162:52.05]But, yeah.
[162:54.03]Shoe on head or pre-recorded?
[162:56.69]Well, there's my hand on my head.
[163:00.40]Alright, we're going back in.
[163:04.33]We are going back in, and I'm gonna try to get the fuck out of there, but I'm probably gonna have to take a longer break.
[163:10.43]I'm probably gonna have to just call it till tomorrow, because we'll do this again tomorrow.
[163:15.18]And, um... Yeah, damn, this is like... This is already dirty!
[163:20.90]My VR helmet is already fucking dirty and greasy and shit where the eyes are.
[163:25.30]Have I just been, like, breathing up into this?
[163:27.32]Hold on.
[163:29.72]Yeah, I must have been just breathing up into this, like, scared.
[163:35.03]Because it's like all foggy.
[163:36.11]Let's see if that helps.
[163:41.29]Alright, we're going back in.
[163:43.81]I'm going to lose contact with you guys for a little while.
[163:47.39]Maybe like another 30 or 40 minutes.
[163:48.90]And then I'm going to have to call it for the night.
[163:51.14]Because you can really only do this in slightly small doses.
[163:57.44]Sweaty?
[163:57.84]Yeah, I know.
[164:05.26]Try to mouth breathe instead of breathing through your nose.
[164:10.30]Alright, let's go.
[164:13.82]Scotty, beam me back in.
[164:18.07]I'm like sweating too.
[164:19.23]Is that on there?
[164:32.07]Lock me in.
[164:33.61]Here we go.
[164:35.56]We in?
[164:37.84]We are in.
[164:38.36]Okay.
[164:42.89]Oh, let me just make sure that shit is done with.
[164:46.81]Okay.
[164:48.83]Okay.
[164:50.57]Let's go.
[164:52.85]Retry.
[164:53.49]Where's the controller?
[164:58.26]Out of play area.
[164:59.06]Bullshit.
[164:59.38]I'm right here.
[165:01.98]So what the hell do I need to do?
[165:06.21]I don't remember.
[165:06.67]I need to just get out of here.
[165:08.59]I wonder where it's going to put me.
[165:16.54]Holy sh- Wow, that's fucking horrible.
[165:19.62]That is so far away.
[165:23.00]Let me just, first of all, where's the scorpion key door?
[165:27.50]Right there.
[165:28.50]What the fuck does that even mean?
[165:32.71]Are there any other scorpion key doors?
[165:48.10]I want to look at the map again, not pour acid on my hand.
[165:51.32]There we go.
[166:09.51]Well, the scorpion door is over there.
[166:17.92]It's down to the right.
[166:21.16]So, we just gotta go get the fucking key again.
[166:24.38]I'm turning around and I'm running.
[166:25.36]I'm not wasting bullets on these things.
[166:27.40]I'm only gonna kill the ones that I know that I have to kill.
[166:34.19]Like this one.
[166:35.01]This one right here.
[166:35.89]Gotta get him right in the head.
[166:38.71]Right in his head.
[166:44.71]Come on, you fucking asshole.
[166:55.29]Got him.
[166:55.79]Okay.
[166:57.19]Four shots in the head kills them.
[167:00.05]I have to land headshots.
[167:01.63]As difficult as that is with a fucking VR helmet.
[167:05.53]I forgot about you!
[167:07.00]Okay.
[167:07.32]Yeah, Tamara.
[167:13.74]Yep, yep, yep.
[167:24.69]There's one in there.
[167:25.69]That's where you get the key.
[167:28.71]Be ready to shoot this guy in the face.
[167:35.11]Here we go.

[174:46.77]I really think I'm getting exhausted to the point where it's like impossible for me to track anybody with this fucking thing on my face.
[175:05.11]Shoot his legs.
[175:07.39]It's definitely fucking worse when they're on the ground Oh Curse you Travis VR is hard mode.

[175:42.09]I feel like a fucking bug.
[175:43.85]I feel like a bird.
[175:44.97]I feel like a fucking bird looking for somebody.
[175:51.47]And I can't go get the shotgun.
[175:55.36]Ugh.
[175:56.84]It might be time to take that break I was talking about.

[177:27.07]I want to get the key and I want to get the fuck out of here.
[177:33.25]I might just say fuck it to Travis.
[177:35.07]You know what I mean?
[177:37.05]Do I need Travis?
[177:39.12]I'm not sure I even need Travis.

[177:58.41]I don't even want to fight Travis.
[178:03.81]Why fight Travis?
[178:06.69]When there's a perfectly good door I can open over here.
[178:32.35]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[178:34.91]There ain't many left.
[178:36.75]There's like one or two in here, right?
[178:39.25]There's one in here.
[178:40.97]Wow!

[179:19.50]There's one behind me.
[179:41.14]My hand was just so fucked up.
[179:55.10]I can't see him.

[180:21.58]Die, you fucking alien.
[180:28.68]Oh, my god.
[180:30.82]Will it ever end?

[180:39.18]OK.
[180:42.21]Whew.
[180:48.13]Okay.
[180:49.77]Should I go fight Travis?
[180:54.55]I don't think I want to fight Travis.
[181:07.29]Oh.
[181:09.05]Very good job.
[181:14.20]Hey, how come this stream has a chat?
[181:16.28]What do you mean?
[181:16.74]Go fuck up Travis?
[181:17.72]No, I'm just using the key.
[181:20.10]Get me out of here.
[181:21.14]No fucking way.
[181:25.56]I'm not fighting Travis.
[181:26.98]All I have is a knife.
[181:29.60]That's gonna be bad, bad, bad news.
[181:33.59]Alright, now where do I- I gotta- not the boiler room.
[181:37.13]Up here, right?
[181:41.68]Because Travis still is not open.
[181:43.76]I just need to... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[181:47.08]Hold on.
[181:47.77]I'm getting turned around here.
[181:50.37]Fuck the treasure photo.
[181:51.23]I don't want it.
[181:51.63]Give me the screwdriver.
[181:55.55]What was the... Is it... Boiler room.
[181:59.87]Alright.
[182:00.71]Over here?
[182:06.44]Chem fluid.
[182:10.09]This is going to take us around here.
[182:11.52]This is down to the morgue.
[182:14.14]Was there another bad guy over here, though?
[182:16.96]I don't remember.
[182:17.46]No.
[182:19.04]Okay, this is the empty door.
[182:20.24]Can't get in here.
[182:23.82]This is not Scorpion.
[182:24.82]Alright.
[182:28.28]First floor.
[182:29.02]There it is.
[182:32.62]So I gotta go... Right, and then...
[182:39.95]Yeah, so through here, over toward the incinerator room.
[182:43.13]Got it.
[182:50.62]Through here.
[182:51.56]Yep.
[182:58.12]And then up.
[183:00.06]No!
[183:00.36]No!
[183:00.90]No!
[183:01.94]No!
[183:02.26]I forgot about you!
[183:05.96]I gotta bait this guy.
[183:06.93]I'm not fighting him.
[183:09.58]Let's play Ring Around the Rosie on the table.
[183:12.76]You're gonna go that way?
[183:14.22]Go on.
[183:21.23]Right, and then to the left.
[183:23.31]Right.
[183:26.83]Up the stairs.
[183:30.15]The save room was over here.
[183:31.25]Does he come up the stairs?
[183:35.23]I hope not.
[183:37.23]Wait, what was that?
[183:38.23]Oh, it's just a bush.
[183:41.69]Alright, fuck off, please.
[183:43.87]An herb, I need that desperately.
[184:00.40]Okay.
[184:01.88]Save it.
[184:04.06]Oh my lord.
[184:04.74]Am I playing with the Kinect?
[184:08.03]Yeah, it's the Xbox Kinect.
[184:15.45]I'm using the controller.
[184:16.17]Yeah, there's no PlayStation Move controller support for the game.
[184:20.55]I'm using the right stick to move left and right quickly, and then the head is everything else, and then forward and back on the other analog.
[184:32.91]Okay, save it here.
[184:40.92]Make ammo.
[184:42.10]I actually was going to try to do that.
[184:45.07]Yeah, the 180 turn is down in circle.
[184:47.31]I'll spin you around.
[184:50.39]Let me go back in here and start making shit.
[184:54.93]Let's make some bullets.
[184:59.33]Get rid of the... I don't want this fucking treasure photo.
[185:09.05]Ten handgun ammo.
[185:10.07]Let's do that again.
[185:14.13]Alright, that looks good.
[185:15.97]Eight shotgun shells.
[185:19.11]Keep the... Yeah, okay.
[185:25.57]Game is saved.
[185:26.45]Let's just save it again.
[185:27.39]And then we'll go down and see what we can do with this key.
[185:31.01]And try to get the shotgun.
[185:31.89]This is fucking wild, man.
[185:43.34]Alright, we're safe.
[185:44.74]That was a disaster for like 10 to 15 straight minutes, I will say.
[185:48.99]Alright, this is the door over here on the right.
[185:52.07]Let's open it with our new key and see what the fuck happens.
[185:58.24]Here we go.
[186:16.55]What?
[186:17.63]That's it?
[186:19.08]That's all that did?
[186:24.04]Huh.
[186:28.58]Alright, so now how do I get this?
[186:39.91]Like, what do I have to put over here?
[186:45.26]I can't, like, leave with the shotgun.
[186:55.10]It's Walt Disney again.
[186:58.96]Yeah, everyone was telling me that I could go get the shotgun, but how is that possible?
[187:03.99]I gotta go get the... Okay, I gotta... Yeah.
[187:07.25]I can go up to Grandma.
[187:09.99]I forgot that I could open that door now.
[187:14.07]Let's go to grandma's room.
[187:15.07]Grandma's room was... Oh, this is a little wonky looking right now.
[187:20.55]Why does it look so weird right now?
[187:23.98]What's going on here?
[187:27.76]What the fuck?
[187:32.08]Oh my God.
[187:35.58]What the fuck, man?
[187:37.28]That was the biggest scare so far.
[187:39.86]I did not expect that guy just to fucking be here.
[187:43.44]I don't have this, this is snake.
[187:47.49]Jesus fucking tap, tap water.
[187:50.11]Alright, grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma.
[188:15.29]Does he know I'm in here?
[188:18.93]I gotta hide.
[188:19.85]We're hiding.
[188:27.33]Don't come in here.
[188:41.80]Don't.
[188:51.04]I'm like, I'm so turned around right now.
[188:56.02]I'm like turning in different directions.
[188:57.70]I don't care.
[189:10.46]Close it.
[189:14.90]I can smell you.
[189:17.56]Shotgun shells.
[189:31.25]I hate this.
[189:32.03]I hate that he's up here.
[189:34.43]Nothing in there, right?
[189:36.87]Where is he?
[189:57.58]Okay, I don't see him.
[190:05.95]I hear him.
[190:06.41]I hear him right now.
[190:07.23]I hear him right now.
[190:08.27]I hear him right now.
[190:11.63]What the fuck is that?
[190:12.57]An ashtray?

[191:59.11]Down the stairs here.
[192:01.81]Back into this room.
[192:05.12]Let's go.
[192:07.46]Whew.
[192:15.88]What was that?
[192:16.28]Oh, it's a coat rack.
[192:16.92]It's okay.
[192:17.70]Just a coat rack.
[192:18.52]Alright, let's go kill Travis.
[192:34.24]Travis now dies.
[192:36.10]What do I got for shots?

[192:38.14]Okay, up is the shotgun.
[192:45.77]Alright, back down we go to go to the dissection room.
[192:55.35]Thankfully, all these things are already dead.
[192:56.89]Where's the dissection room?
[192:58.81]I think we just gotta, just gotta go down, save it.
[193:09.70]My goodness.
[193:14.32]Save over this.
[193:16.53]Overwrite the save.
[193:17.27]Yep.
[193:17.43]Oh boy.
[193:21.04]I'm late.
[193:21.42]Did he puke yet?
[193:22.22]Not yet.
[193:23.90]Not yet.
[193:25.24]No pukes yet.
[193:31.58]Alright.
[193:33.10]Here we go.
[193:40.44]Alright, Travis.
[193:44.41]Give me my last piece of the head.
[193:51.35]I need the key that he has.
[193:52.37]I got the shotgun.
[193:55.37]These things don't respawn, right?
[194:00.13]Like, these motherfuckers don't respawn, right?
[194:03.57]If they do, I'm going to be real upset.
[194:07.81]Please do not respawn.
[194:10.68]Don't respawn.
[194:12.60]Ah, they don't respawn.
[194:13.50]Thank God.
[194:20.37]Alright, Travis.
[194:23.23]I've had just about enough of your shit.
[194:27.55]It is time for you to die once and for all.
[194:32.97]What up, Travis?
[194:38.87]You alright, Travis?
[194:44.19]You look a little under the weather.
[194:52.65]Put this away for now.
[194:54.01]We can use the regular gun.
[194:55.41]Alright, dissecting room is down here.
[195:06.30]Left, and that's great.
[195:10.42]And to the right.
[195:21.79]But is this the key?
[195:24.25]I don't think this worked the last time I came over here.
[195:29.15]I guess it does now.
[195:29.93]Okay, here we go.
[195:33.03]Never been here before.
[195:35.67]Good luck.
[195:38.33]What the fuck is that?
[195:45.56]Dog's head.
[195:46.20]Okay.
[195:52.90]I knew it, I knew it.
[195:53.97]So this guy, I have to kill this guy.
[196:01.57]Good thing we have the shotgun.
[196:25.02]Hmm.
[196:26.12]You guys ready for a fucking Satan face?
[196:27.68]It's gonna happen.
[196:38.24]That's the boiler.
[196:39.00]I'm gonna open this because now it can be opened from this side.
[196:43.96]And down we go.
[196:58.79]Well, they sure are preparing me.
[197:09.04]Twelve shots.
[197:11.06]With the shotgun.
[197:14.12]That should be... I feel like that should be enough.
[197:18.63]This looks like a place where you fight a guy.
[197:23.01]I would say.
[197:31.72]Let's take a look.
[197:45.24]Satan face.
[197:47.68]Poor deputy.
[197:54.70]Ah.
[198:04.52]Fucking hell.
[198:11.94]I hear something moving.
[198:12.77]The tension is sure building.
[198:37.05]Maybe I can stun him or something when we... Oh, there's the dog head.
[198:44.52]He's gonna be right behind me.
[198:47.98]Yep.
[198:48.36]Here we go.
[198:50.64]Fuck off.
[198:53.69]No way.
[199:09.98]Seriously, what?
[199:10.88]He didn't get staggered from that shit?
[199:13.90]What the fuck?
[199:14.78]Okay, we're good.
[199:19.93]I like you.
[199:26.49]For what's on the inside.
[199:28.55]You know.
[199:44.14]Back it up!
[199:44.78]Back it up!
[199:49.15]Wow!
[199:49.59]No!
[199:49.89]What is going on with this?
[200:09.62]What is going on with this neck?
[200:14.61]Okay.
[200:15.29]Fuck!
[200:24.66]Do I get one of those?
[200:30.14]Wow!

[201:20.81]Trying to fucking attack with this thing I feel like I'm gonna give myself fucking whiplash Just do it again
[201:59.23]I'm trying just to get him.
[202:01.37]That is so awkward.
[202:02.43]Alright, I just can't get hit.
[202:09.87]Easier said than done, though.
[202:13.10]Can I, like, open this?
[202:14.56]I wonder if I can just do it from the other side or something.
[202:25.60]This is where he is.
[202:26.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[202:27.80]Oh, poor deputy.
[202:34.98]Yep.
[202:37.46]Ugh.
[202:41.93]Like... That's not helping me right now, if I'm honest.
[202:53.28]In fact, I... Here's what I'm going to do for this fight.
[203:07.14]That might be a little too much.
[203:12.01]Well, fuck it.
[203:12.53]Let's go.
[203:12.85]Let's go, you fucking asshole.
[203:20.67]Time to die.
[204:02.12]That's my health, I can't even see it.
[204:10.85]It's not bad, but it's not great!
[204:19.03]Go, you fucker!
[204:26.25]Here we go.
[204:33.84]What the fuck?
[204:38.43]Here he goes.
[204:42.97]Give me mine, give me mine, give me mine.
[204:44.68]Give me my chainsaw.
[204:59.30]That didn't do anything.
[205:01.26]That doesn't do anything!
[205:34.65]God damn it!
[205:48.48]Die!
[205:57.65]Oh my God, what is happening?
[206:01.09]What the fuck is happening?
[206:02.45]I'm out of gas!
[206:17.71]No!
[206:24.03]I don't have any healing.
[206:46.75]I'm gonna die!
[207:30.61]Turn off the VR?
[207:32.21]No, I have to beat him in VR.
[207:36.11]As much as an awkward fucking mess as this is in VR playing against a boss like this.
[207:41.00]I have to beat him in VR.
[207:42.04]It's VR stream.
[207:42.88]I have to.
[207:43.26]God damn it.
[207:54.08]I can only heal twice.
[207:54.80]I can't get hit in the very beginning.
[207:56.24]I just can't.
[208:03.30]Fucking hell.
[208:04.52]I was so close.
[208:07.06]Is there any more healing that I know of?
[208:08.78]Can I, like, use that fucking super thing?
[208:10.40]Eh, poor deputy.
[208:15.53]Right.
[208:16.31]God damn it.
[208:25.05]Oh, I gotta readjust.
[208:31.51]Ugh.
[208:34.24]Zap them.
[208:37.83]L2 and R2.
[208:38.45]I was doing L2 and R2.
[208:39.31]I only have two healing things.
[208:46.29]Alright, I'll give this one more attempt.
[208:48.17]And then I really have to take a break.
[208:50.09]Because I've been fucking VR helmeting for like three and a half hours now.
[208:55.10]And it's starting to kill me.
[208:58.16]So I'm gonna, after this fucking attempt, win or lose, I gotta get out of here.
[209:02.68]I gotta take a break.
[209:07.61]Hopefully I can kill him here.
[209:15.05]What am I stuck on?
[209:15.85]Fucking wall.
[209:41.41]Alright, here we go.
[209:42.87]Let's go.
[209:45.09]Get, please get out of the fucking way and go get your stupid chainsaw.
[209:49.04]Please, your stupid AI, just go get it.
[209:51.14]Go get it.
[209:51.46]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[210:20.52]Die, you motherfucker!
[210:37.69]I'm almost out of gas.
[210:52.28]I gotta reload this thing.
[211:00.11]Reload it!
[211:01.17]Reload it!
[211:01.67]Come on!
[211:23.44]No!
[211:26.12]No, it's... Please stop moving around!
[211:28.80]Come on!
[211:53.75]No, don't come at me
[212:12.13]Die!
[212:12.95]Please!
[212:21.19]Fucking die!
[212:22.31]Die!
[212:23.13]Die!
[212:26.27]Hey!
[212:26.89]Hey!
[212:27.71]Hey!
[212:28.83]Hey!
[212:36.26]Do me a favor and stay dead.
[212:43.98]Okay.
[212:48.64]Alright.
[213:10.44]My fucking body hurts.
[213:14.59]What a beautiful thing to end tonight on.
[213:16.21]Yeah, I know.
[213:16.77]Let's... Oh, I just ripped my fucking hair out.
[213:20.11]Ow!
[213:22.21]Ow.
[213:25.22]Jesus, that fucking hurt.
[213:36.85]Alright.
[213:37.63]Let's wrap it up, huh?
[213:41.27]What do I need to do?
[213:41.77]There's something here I need to do.
[213:42.89]Just open the door and get the fuck out of here.
[213:59.73]Ugh.
[214:00.91]Okay.
[214:01.71]That's done with.
[214:02.53]I'm done with you, Chainsaw, apparently.
[214:06.28]Anything else that I missed?
[214:09.70]Oh, there we go.
[214:13.22]Don't want to miss that.
[214:13.90]That's my health.
[214:14.64]I'm okay.
[214:19.28]Phew.
[214:19.84]That was fucking intense.
[214:23.67]Hold on.
[214:24.07]Don't want to leave without breaking the box.
[214:29.81]Alright.
[214:30.43]Time to go.
[214:36.99]That'll bring us right to here.
[214:38.36]I have the last head.
[214:44.56]I'm gonna save it, and we're gonna call it there.
[214:49.02]So if you just joined us, if you were here just for the Resident Evil VR shit, thanks for hanging out.
[214:57.17]Thank you for sticking around.
[214:58.97]But I just need to get the hell out of here.
[215:03.85]Get to the save point, and I'm gonna call this stream.
[215:07.95]Before I go, though, I'm going to take a look at the people that subscribed and shit.
[215:14.17]I'm just going to take a look at if there was any large bit donations or something like that.
[215:18.64]Am I even going the right fucking way?
[215:20.04]Yeah.
[215:21.62]If there are any large donations, I'd like to say hello to the people that did it.
[215:27.04]It doesn't open from this side.
[215:28.08]I probably missed something there, but who cares right now?
[215:31.40]Here.
[215:36.10]You want to know my consensus on this game in VR?
[215:38.39]It's fucking awesome.
[215:41.37]It is fucking awesome.
[215:43.15]No, that's not right.
[215:46.59]The one issue I have with this game in VR is it can be sort of... And when I say sort of, I mean extremely difficult to aim.
[216:09.57]Somebody's singing now.
[216:21.23]Satan.
[216:22.29]Satan?
[216:35.57]Okay.
[216:38.85]Just get me the save room.
[216:41.34]That was the save room.
[216:43.96]Grandma, we'll have to deal with this tomorrow.
[216:46.54]I ain't talking to you right now.
[216:53.24]Whoa, alrighty.
[216:58.17]Saving game, overwrite, yes.
[217:04.69]The spook counter?
[217:06.37]You guys got a spook counter going?
[217:10.02]Well, there we go.
[217:14.22]What a nice old lady.
[217:20.36]Well, that's gonna be it, everybody.
[217:23.18]My lips are chapped.
[217:25.92]My eyes are bloodshot.
[217:29.66]That was a lot of fun, though.
[217:30.56]I actually did enjoy that very much.
[217:33.18]So Resident Evil 7 in VR.
[217:34.88]There it is.
[217:35.64]It's fucking crazy.
[217:39.22]But thanks a lot for coming everybody.
[217:40.70]See you later.
[217:41.62]I don't have very much else planned besides to go take a break.
[217:47.52]Hope you enjoyed yourselves.
[217:48.32]See you tomorrow.
[217:49.82]We'll probably... I don't know if I'll... I might start with VR tomorrow.
[217:54.40]We'll see.
[217:56.98]We'll see what happens tomorrow.
[217:58.90]Hopefully I don't have like a massive headache tomorrow.
[218:02.13]But yeah, just before I go, I want to say, let me see if anybody... All the subs, I couldn't see any of my head notifications turned off for most of it, but... Some people gave us a lot of money, it looked like.
[218:14.97]Unit2321 gave at least $25 or $30.
[218:18.50]So, thanks a lot, dude.
[218:23.98]I just want to scroll through and make sure I didn't miss any big, big donations.
[218:29.32]Which I'm not sure I did.
[218:32.50]No, I don't think I did.
[218:34.90]But yeah.
[218:35.82]Thank you for watching.
[218:36.89]Take care.
[218:37.27]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[218:38.87]We'll pick up right where we left off.
[218:41.51]And let's see where the VR trip takes us.
[218:44.67]So goodnight, guys.
[218:45.77]Thank you so much.
[218:47.55]See you tomorrow.
[218:49.52]There's not going to be any delay tomorrow.
[218:50.92]We're going to start at the regular time.
[218:53.10]Because I just had to set everything up.
[218:55.86]Much love, everybody.
[218:57.12]See you soon.
[219:00.60]Take care, everybody.
[219:07.87]Small donations can fuck off.
[219:09.25]No, that's not... I just didn't want to make sure.
[219:11.05]I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss, like... Oh, somebody gave you, like, a thousand dollars.
[219:15.30]Like, holy shit, I would not want to, like, miss that.
[219:18.30]I appreciate all you guys that give any fucking money or any subs.
[219:21.02]I just didn't see any of them because all the notifications were off.
[219:24.78]But goodbye, everybody.
[219:25.90]See you tomorrow.
[219:44.84]you
[220:19.71]you
