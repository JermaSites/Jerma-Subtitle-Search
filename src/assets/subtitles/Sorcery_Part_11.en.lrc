[01:32.82]Listen to that music.
[01:37.94]I had to let that play out for like at least, you know, 20 or 30 seconds.
[01:43.88]Happy Friday.
[01:45.74]Happy Friday evening, to be more exact.
[01:51.84]He clicked.
[01:52.38]I did click here, right?
[01:59.89]Let me move some stuff around.
[02:04.47]Yeah, it's Slick Rick.
[02:06.01]Slick Rick Jerva.
[02:12.34]Sombra?
[02:13.46]What?
[02:13.94]Sombra got announced?
[02:17.00]What are her moves?
[02:17.65]Does she go... Bet you she does.
[02:37.05]Let's get the game over here.
[02:39.67]Hey, look.
[02:42.89]Sorcery, part four.
[02:43.93]We're going to try to beat it tonight.
[02:45.65]Or come at least fairly close to beating it tonight.
[02:56.43]Describe what in two words it was.
[02:58.12]What was that?
[03:03.52]Only two months?
[03:04.33]What a loser.
[03:05.19]What are you talking about?
[03:09.93]That's plenty of time.
[03:11.97]Dampy123 and XenosDB.
[03:15.59]Thank you both for two months, respectively.
[03:20.24]Casino Night?
[03:21.04]We did Casino Night last night.
[03:27.72]It's a disappointing moveset reveal, is it really?
[03:29.68]I mean, I don't really play Overwatch anymore.
[03:35.80]Why am I not watching Star play?
[03:37.14]Because I stream at 7 o'clock on Friday.
[03:40.26]I'm not going to cancel the stream because one of my friends is playing in a game.
[03:49.55]Stream's cancelled.
[03:50.69]Somebody I know is playing in a tournament.
[03:54.41]That ain't going to happen.
[04:01.34]The moveset seems annoying.
[04:09.92]But America.
[04:11.08]I forgot about your own holiday Friday.
[04:27.89]Friday is no holiday.
[04:35.62]Looks like a more annoying tracer.
[04:37.68]I didn't even look at... So she does like a teleport.
[04:40.64]She puts down a little device and can teleport to it, right?
[04:42.74]And she can go invisible.
[04:44.08]And she can destroy shields.
[04:47.08]Seems... What a crappy friend.
[04:51.53]Well, thank you, Crodon, for the 1500.
[04:54.09]Reverse the roles.
[04:56.77]I guarantee you, if I was playing in the tournament, Star wouldn't cancel his stream to come watch it.
[05:03.61]No goddamn way.
[05:06.52]He'd call me a loser and keep playing whatever he was doing.
[05:11.94]And you all know it.
[05:15.01]But again, thanks, Grodin, for the 1500.
[05:16.21]Nope.
[05:29.14]True.
[05:30.58]True.
[05:31.82]He wouldn't even think about it.
[05:37.44]Feels bad.
[05:41.48]She can hack health kits to make them not work for the other team.
[05:53.13]I love this guy's name.
[05:53.93]Soup or Salad.
[05:56.43]Yeah, we're just chilling for a little bit because I don't want to start until... Give it a few minutes for people to trickle in.
[06:03.08]Give it a few minutes.
[06:08.05]But Super Salad is a great name.
[06:12.12]And thank you to the real... RKiteKT, the real man to subscribe.
[06:19.04]Thanks, dude.
[06:20.75]Cornstalk77, thank you for five months.
[06:22.65]And thank you, my vengeance, for two months.
[06:24.25]Welcome, dude.
[06:26.51]Welcome.
[06:30.02]Cornstalk Hand.
[06:35.59]Alright.
[06:36.09]I guess enough time has kind of gone by now.
[06:39.51]I usually like to give like five or ten minutes.
[06:43.20]You know, before we really get going.
[06:48.21]Why does my dashboard say that I'm offline?
[06:50.67]It shouldn't.
[06:53.24]Look, we'll put it this way.
[06:55.80]Star, really hope Team USA brings it home.
[07:00.03]Star and Seagull are on that team, right?
[07:02.23]And other good players.
[07:04.05]I wish them the best of luck.
[07:05.73]But I got Sorcery to play.
[07:07.65]You know what I'm saying?
[07:09.47]Got Sorcery to play.
[07:10.50]Part 4, almost to the Archmage.
[07:15.28]They're going to win.
[07:16.22]You guys all know they're going to win.
[07:22.47]The best part was Blizzard hilariously mishandled the ARG.
[07:26.89]5-hour stream?
[07:27.95]I'll probably go a long time tonight, I would assume.
[07:38.26]Playing video games is better than supporting your friends.
[07:41.35]Let that be known.
[07:43.45]No.
[07:44.19]Saucery.
[07:45.77]Part 4.
[07:47.33]Less than, like, probably a couple hours away from the Archmage.
[07:55.73]Plus, I mean, like, I'm gonna be honest again.
[07:57.59]I... I don't really... I'm, like, I'm bumping into the fucking mic and shit.
[08:03.05]I don't really, uh... play Overwatch.
[08:05.33]I don't really care about it right now.
[08:09.82]I mean, maybe when Sombra comes out, I'll probably give it another play.
[08:12.82]Maybe go and do another season or something, but... It's a good game, but I don't... Shit, you know what I mean?
[08:20.38]I don't really care.
[08:21.70]Ah!
[08:25.45]This is why he invaded you last night.
[08:36.04]He's getting flustered.
[08:38.02]Move my damn mic.
[08:39.36]I can't.
[08:39.78]There's nowhere else for it to go.
[08:42.26]I'm so sorry.
[08:45.92]I dropped Overwatch faster than TF2.
[08:47.54]No, I...
[08:52.46]Still watching part two?
[08:57.08]Well, you got a long way to go.
[08:58.06]There's like 30 hours of streams.
[09:01.83]Get out of here.
[09:02.49]Don't watch this.
[09:03.73]Rewind back to part two.
[09:04.91]That's what you got to do.
[09:09.01]But thanks for the 1500 croton.
[09:11.29]Thank you to Tender Tacos for subscribing.
[09:13.98]Suicidal Spree, thanks for two months.
[09:15.40]Good day from Australia.
[09:16.34]Good day.
[09:17.80]Good day, mate.
[09:19.16]Can only catch these streams when I'm not at work, but I subbed anyway because you're awesome.
[09:22.36]Well, you're awesome, dude.
[09:26.69]Welcome to Clever Virus and ZYZX.
[09:29.39]I saw him chatting earlier.
[09:30.59]Thanks, ZYZX.
[09:32.37]ZZX.
[09:34.26]And Lolladucho, thanks for three months.
[09:39.88]Oh yeah, and I got my vengeance.
[09:42.18]And then Crodon with another 200.
[09:44.02]Crodon!
[09:45.68]Crodon, stop spending money and go watch part two.
[09:50.82]Money wasted on bits counter?
[09:54.64]No.
[09:55.62]No, no, no.
[09:58.34]But thanks a lot, guys.
[09:59.04]We're gonna get started now.
[10:01.20]Here we go.
[10:02.94]If you do not remember where we were, I'm gonna give a brief synopsis of what happened in the last stream.
[10:09.66]We got to Mampang.
[10:11.42]Fortress of Mampang.
[10:12.48]We actually got into the main gate.
[10:16.40]Which is right here.
[10:18.46]Started back here.
[10:19.18]There's all kinds of trials and tribulations.
[10:21.54]I remember I burnt a goat person.
[10:24.06]Had a giant skunk bear fart in my face a few times.
[10:26.21]Made it through the chasm.
[10:28.39]We got in this room.
[10:29.67]I pulled the door open with six people.
[10:32.63]Eventually I snuck in a wagon.
[10:34.97]Got in the front door.
[10:36.78]We're not quite in the city yet.
[10:38.80]This is the city here.
[10:41.73]Where, uh, Hi-Zammon and Manpang are.
[10:47.35]Is the view counter wrong or is there only 58 people here?
[10:50.23]Um... According to what mine says, there's just over 700 right now.
[10:56.39]Maybe the view counter is, uh, slow or broken?
[10:59.59]I don't know.
[11:01.41]If there were 58, who cares?
[11:02.66]If there's 700, who cares?
[11:03.88]That's... Whoever's here is here.
[11:08.96]I love you all regardless.
[11:11.56]Where did Flanker go?
[11:12.34]I have no idea.
[11:13.58]It was a brief moment where we kind of met.
[11:17.65]Eye to eye, and then he took off again.
[11:19.63]We had a great little bromance.
[11:21.03]It was awesome.
[11:22.87]Alright, let's continue.
[11:23.65]We went to the kitchen.
[11:25.91]We snuck in, got to the kitchen, made a shitty goblin soup, and then snuck down here into the tunnels, which seemed to lead potentially up into this actual city.
[11:39.22]Let's go.
[11:40.58]In the tunnel.
[11:43.28]You slither and slide your way down into the darkness of the tunnel.
[11:46.46]It is unclear who built this.
[11:48.34]There are no supports or indications of construction.
[11:50.78]There seem to be tooth marks in the walls.
[11:54.61]Hmm.
[11:56.19]Tooth marks.
[11:59.57]You splash on through the shallow water, the rock walls drip with dank memes, and the smell is stale and fetid.
[12:05.90]I can't believe I just said that.
[12:07.88]There is no way to tell how much more of this there is to go.
[12:11.88]I just fucking said dank memes.
[12:13.70]Great.
[12:15.82]You splash onwards, the tunnel turns a corner here, rising upwards towards a chink of light.
[12:22.16]So there's like a small little light here.
[12:24.18]Okay.
[12:26.14]Okay.
[12:28.07]You climb upwards using the rough edge of the tunnel as footholds to ascend.
[12:32.43]There is a fresh scent from somewhere overhead.
[12:36.59]Dank memes.
[12:37.67]And I don't know why I said it.
[12:39.19]I just like... It just was like... It was right there on my tongue.
[12:43.13]I had to say it.
[12:43.81]Alright.
[12:48.31]After some more clamoring, you come with inside of a grate in the ceiling.
[12:53.61]Light feel... Did somebody just clip me saying dank memes?
[13:04.09]And standing right on top of it are a pair of feet.
[13:05.85]So there's like, I'm looking up at the grate right now.
[13:12.01]No, what, what, what race?
[13:13.86]What's this racist?
[13:14.86]What is, what the hell are you guys talking about?
[13:22.12]What did I do?
[13:22.54]That was racist.
[13:24.06]What is happening?
[13:36.30]What?
[13:36.70]What?
[13:37.94]What did I do?
[13:38.68]Wait, what did I say?
[13:40.10]You guys got me all sorts of confused now.
[13:44.85]I can't even look up.
[13:45.83]I can't even see what happened.
[13:46.77]Oh.
[13:46.91]Oh, right, right.
[13:52.37]Okay, alright.
[13:55.47]Settle down.
[13:55.91]Settle down.
[13:56.53]Settle down.
[13:57.76]Settle down.
[14:11.24]Now I see.
[14:15.44]Well, be easy, guys.
[14:18.52]Don't worry.
[14:19.06]Alright.
[14:21.16]I'm looking up somebody's feet.
[14:25.12]He said settle down.
[14:27.05]Settling down.
[14:29.33]After some more clamoring, yeah, I'm looking up this feet of the great.
[14:31.47]Look at the great.
[14:32.53]There's people standing on it.
[14:34.85]Should I like
[14:39.71]I don't know, should I fucking throw something at the grate?
[14:48.24]I'm gonna listen.
[14:49.48]No, I don't want to cast a spell.
[14:57.89]Listen.
[15:02.79]You wait a few seconds and are rewarded as the guards above begin to chatter.
[15:06.47]Keep your eyes open.
[15:07.99]They say he's on his way.
[15:10.30]Who?
[15:11.16]You know who.
[15:12.86]I'm not worried.
[15:14.32]No assassin can kill the Archmage, however clever they are.
[15:17.91]Alright, they're talking about, uh... They're talking about... This has to be Flaker they're referring to, right?
[15:29.15]Ad block for you.
[15:30.05]Thank you, Todd.
[15:36.43]Uh... I'm gonna...
[15:39.99]I'm going to press on.
[15:40.57]No.
[15:40.63]I'm going to look up.
[15:44.94]The grate looks fixed into the stone.
[15:46.38]It is not hinged or designed to be opened, but presumably just to let this tunnel vent steam.
[15:58.90]What can I do for spells?
[16:01.66]I wonder.
[16:13.17]Could I drop the grate from underneath these guys?
[16:19.22]What happens if I open the grate?
[16:20.24]Are they both going to fall down?
[16:27.22]I could zap the grate.
[16:29.22]I could zap it.
[16:37.21]Yeah, but talk with animals.
[16:38.41]It's like two guys standing on a sewer grate.
[16:44.92]It isn't a door.
[16:45.52]That's right, it's not a door.
[16:46.48]Is someone a replica creature?
[16:59.67]What?
[16:59.83]There's no creature even here.
[17:06.68]Uh, I can't.
[17:07.28]It's... Wait a minute.
[17:09.24]Zob?
[17:09.76]No.
[17:13.06]Zen?
[17:13.42]I can float.
[17:13.84]Okay, I'm gonna float to the grate and grab the guy.
[17:20.08]You weave the spell and the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently up into the air.
[17:25.43]Open the crate.
[17:26.19]Should I just, like, ninja turtle out of this thing?
[17:28.45]I'm gonna open it.
[17:33.46]You float up to the grate and try to push it open, but it is too old and rusted sealed for you to get any purchase on it.
[17:41.71]Fuck.
[17:42.55]I'm just like floating underneath these guys' feet.
[17:48.90]Zob, zob, zob.
[17:55.46]What can I throw?
[17:56.72]Beer.
[17:59.52]You grab a pebble and toss it up against the grate.
[18:01.96]The guard stopped talking immediately and you see the feet move this way and that.
[18:06.12]What was that?
[18:07.60]Sounds like it came from down here.
[18:12.34]Hey, it's me.
[18:14.74]Greetings.
[18:16.48]Greetings, replies the guard uncertainly.
[18:19.73]What are you doing down there?
[18:23.09]I'm the Anor Lander.
[18:24.51]I'm lost.
[18:30.13]Should I just say I've lost?
[18:32.61]I've lost.
[18:34.55]You certainly are.
[18:35.67]That's a sewer.
[18:38.33]Can you get me out of here?
[18:41.31]No.
[18:41.79]Apologies, brother.
[18:43.43]These grates don't open.
[18:44.99]Never have.
[18:46.79]Just keep going along, the other guard remarks.
[18:49.49]You'll find your way out somewhere.
[18:51.73]Good luck.
[18:55.05]Good luck, huh?
[18:57.58]Hmm.
[19:00.05]Yeah.
[19:02.62]Well, good luck to you, too.
[19:05.42]Zap him!
[19:08.30]Consulting the stars, you bind the magic, generating a charge of electrical energy within your palm.
[19:12.90]Blast the grate or blast the guards?
[19:15.78]Blast off the grate!
[19:17.66]You fire the blast up at the Great, which lights up with electricity.
[19:21.88]The guard screams as he jumps clear.
[19:24.88]But by Grend's nostrils!
[19:27.01]How?
[19:28.15]You don't think it's the Anor Lander?
[19:30.59]Could be.
[19:31.67]We better call the captain.
[19:33.59]You hear their feet pounding away.
[19:35.13]More light filters down from above now that the guards have gone away.
[19:48.51]uh okay bye don't hiss alright let's go to the tunnel's end yeah the hiss is back you reach the end of the tunnel a short flight of slick stone step slick stone steps leads up to a trap door in the ceiling your weight returns and you settle gradually back down to the ground when I was floating that whole time
[20:19.36]Look at the trapdoor.
[20:21.32]The trapdoor is set neatly into the rocky ceiling and is closed tight.
[20:25.18]It looks as though it hasn't been opened in a very long time.
[20:29.54]Can it just be opened?
[20:32.12]You scramble quickly upwards, keen to get out of the tunnel as quickly as possible.
[20:36.16]But the trapdoor, when you reach it, is so firmly locked it does not even shiver when you shove it.
[20:43.04]Well, let's stop it.
[20:48.98]Let's give it the old DOP.
[20:50.44]What do you say?
[20:53.12]Open doors.
[20:56.70]You gather the stars, but nothing happens.
[20:58.88]The trapdoor does not even shake.
[21:00.66]Perhaps it is protected by some magical defense.
[21:03.26]Or else, there's not a door at all.
[21:08.85]You blasted off the sewer grate for fun?
[21:10.79]That didn't even work.
[21:11.91]I shot the sewer grate and I scared a bunch of guys.
[21:14.93]You bang on the trapdoor, it doesn't budge.
[21:17.43]Not even slightly.
[21:18.17]More suspiciously, it barely even booms.
[21:23.13]You pull the wood of the trapdoor, and after some work with the chopping knife, a strip falls away, revealing smooth rock beneath.
[21:30.54]Seems this was once a trapdoor, but has since been filled in, perhaps with a petrification spell cast onto the wood itself.
[21:38.79]Turn back.
[21:39.21]How do I get out of here?
[21:42.93]You have to go back to the grate?
[21:45.67]How am I gonna open this?
[21:49.78]You return along the tunnel when you hear something growling.
[21:52.56]It seems your banging has attracted attention.
[21:56.86]Pull the sword out.
[21:59.84]You draw your sword in readiness and not a moment too soon.
[22:02.33]There is a splash of a footfall as something approaches its speed.
[22:06.29]It's a towering ratbear.
[22:08.37]It's always a ratbear.
[22:12.11]Should I yap the Ratbear?
[22:20.68]Let me read its mind.
[22:24.24]Dop the Great?
[22:26.92]I could Dop the Great, but it doesn't even have handles.
[22:34.59]Gum, create glue.
[22:39.29]Wait a minute.
[22:41.11]Oh, hold on.
[22:43.88]I think we might be able to cause a little lively dancing to this ratbear jig.
[22:52.08]You craft the enchantment, pulling out your bamboo flute and starting to play.
[22:55.54]For a moment, it seems like it is having no effect.
[22:58.20]The ratbear lashes at you with its tail and claws, but then you notice the attacks are rhythmic and symmetric.
[23:05.03]The creature is dancing, nasty, spiky dancing that would kill anyone who came too close, but dancing nonetheless.
[23:12.61]It is unclear how this will help you, however.
[23:16.21]Lead him down the tunnel?
[23:19.17]Lead the ratbear down the tunnel dancing.
[23:23.36]Definitely.
[23:24.98]You lead the ratbear a short way along the tunnel.
[23:26.82]It splashes and twists in the water, making strange shapes and movements with its tail.
[23:32.41]Keep playing.
[23:34.33]You keep playing, hoping to wear the creature out.
[23:36.35]Perhaps it is working.
[23:37.55]Perhaps it is working.
[23:38.19]It's hard to tell.
[23:39.17]You finish your playing and lower the pipe from your lips.
[23:41.79]The ratbear ceases its dance and looks at you through narrow animal eyes.
[23:46.72]Then it bows its head, turns and disappears down the passage into the dark.
[23:52.03]You stop to recover your breath.
[23:53.95]But though you are alive, you're still stuck down in the dark.
[24:00.60]What?
[24:02.58]Why?
[24:03.24]What?
[24:05.18]He's just like, oh, thanks for making me dance.
[24:06.78]Bye.
[24:08.28]Okay.
[24:11.42]Sure thing.
[24:15.83]Major 598,000 bits.
[24:17.53]Jeremy, you suck.
[24:18.51]Sorcery sucks.
[24:19.45]Bits suck.
[24:21.74]Thanks for the thousand, man.
[24:22.72]I appreciate it.
[24:25.36]You have a load of dance.
[24:27.38]Also, thanks to Salt621 for subscribing.
[24:29.24]Welcome, dude.
[24:31.60]And where is the lemur also subscribed?
[24:36.65]Welcome.
[24:38.03]Welcome.
[24:40.31]Alright, well, let's drop the gate.
[24:42.65]I'm underneath the gate right now, right?
[24:47.34]I was hoping I could bring him to the grate and make him break it and unleash him on the town or something crazy.
[24:51.98]Alright, let's drop the gate, see if it works.
[24:56.04]Open locks and doors.
[24:58.88]Reaching up to the constellations, you create the spell and the grate overhead flips open.
[25:02.16]It actually worked.
[25:03.64]Climb through the grate.
[25:06.87]You must obey the dance commander.
[25:09.83]You jump to try and grab the overhead grate, but you cannot reach it.
[25:12.47]Ah, no, I gotta float up there.
[25:19.88]Now I can zen and I just float up there.
[25:23.85]Hover in the air, grab the ledge and get out of here.
[25:27.97]Float through the grate.
[25:30.21]You float up and out through the open grate.
[25:32.14]Cool.
[25:33.16]Out of the tunnel.
[25:36.43]You settle to the dirt of Mampang and kick the grate shut behind you.
[25:40.53]You're in a narrow alley between two large buildings.
[25:43.38]At the far end, you see a glimpse of some kind of plaza.
[25:47.24]The sun has reached its highest point now.
[25:49.40]You slip your way forwards.
[25:52.94]We've made it into the city, along the alley.
[25:55.89]Nice stamina.
[25:58.25]There's barely enough space to walk between the two buildings, which list inwards on both sides.
[26:04.92]Look at the buildings.
[26:05.52]The buildings on both sides are topped by large glass domes.
[26:09.03]The one on the right larger than that on the left.
[26:12.01]You siddle onwards down the alley.
[26:15.73]The widening alley.
[26:19.17]The alley widens out a little bit here as you approach the square at the end.
[26:23.57]You're inside the city.
[26:25.65]Time to explore.
[26:27.81]Looking around, you're surprised to find this part of Mampang is more like a city than you expected.
[26:32.30]There are merchants, laborers, and swaggering guards washing hangs from hooks outside the stacked houses.
[26:38.52]Of course, there are far more wicked glares and knives tucked into belts than ever, even in Ikari.
[26:44.40]Suddenly, you feel hooked fingers catch your arm.
[26:48.90]Draw my sword.
[26:50.44]You go for your sword, but a voice murmurs, You won't be needing that.
[26:54.52]There's no one else here.
[26:56.62]You blink with surprise.
[26:58.54]A moment later, the tall buildings of Mampang that you traveled so far to reach have disappeared.
[27:02.90]Now we're in Kare.
[27:09.76]Okay.
[27:11.00]You stand in a humid climate.
[27:13.38]Yeah.
[27:15.00]Tall plants lean down on all sides, and a thin, watery sunlight leaks through some kind of glass ceiling, choked with weeds.
[27:25.33]Is this the lady again?
[27:26.47]Libra?
[27:28.47]There's no sign of the goddess.
[27:29.75]A beggar stands beside you, however, but no longer holding your arm.
[27:33.74]He stands taller and seems better fed.
[27:36.38]That's better.
[27:37.78]Now we can talk more freely.
[27:41.29]Where are we?
[27:43.14]This is a favorite little spot of mine, forgotten corner of Kari.
[27:47.04]The Lost Gardens of Briar.
[27:49.24]Even the gardeners who work here can't remember the way in.
[27:52.28]It's all on the maps, but no one can find the entrance.
[27:55.50]My own little fortress.
[27:57.66]He reaches rather tenderly for a nearby plant and pulls off a graying leaf.
[28:04.89]Who the fuck is this guy?
[28:05.69]Who are you?
[28:07.15]My name is Throbben.
[28:09.24]The beggar bows most politely.
[28:10.99]You notice he wears a circle of finger bones on his head.
[28:14.49]Some have called me Necromancer, but they only mean that death has never stopped my work.
[28:21.69]Foul magic.
[28:23.79]All magic is foul to those who have not tasted it.
[28:26.79]Throben smiles.
[28:28.19]Come, let's walk a little, shall we?
[28:31.31]He begins to saunter between the trees and you follow.
[28:35.27]Throben, Throben, Throben.
[28:40.61]What have you done?
[28:42.27]Moved us elsewhere, so we can talk.
[28:46.07]This place is hidden from the Archmage?
[28:48.85]Quite so.
[28:50.17]The Archmage would chew a Death Sponge mushroom and then eat my brains if he had the chance.
[28:55.24]Best for us all if that doesn't happen.
[28:58.08]Throbben points at a nearby flower.
[29:00.82]Do you see this one?
[29:02.24]Purple Thornweed.
[29:03.90]Only grows in one place.
[29:05.62]The slopes above my home village.
[29:09.53]Very nice.
[29:11.01]It was.
[29:11.45]I grew up in the same village as the archmage, you know.
[29:15.40]A small place called Karimia, Karimana.
[29:18.22]I forget the name of my own village.
[29:20.20]Maybe you've heard of it.
[29:21.69]He sweeps away, his face hidden from view.
[29:24.09]This way now.
[29:25.79]He steps between two plants and then disappears.
[29:30.31]Into the gardens.
[29:33.63]You push your way between the plants and find the beggar waiting.
[29:36.72]Only now he is no beggar, but a tall, handsome man wearing a long cloak embroidered with runes of power.
[29:43.99]There you are.
[29:45.55]I was told to expect you.
[29:49.33]Where the hell's the old man?
[29:51.37]Safely in my future.
[29:53.55]Please excuse any confusion.
[29:55.23]I use these gardens for conversations quite extensively.
[29:58.53]But I veer to... I have to space them out, you know.
[30:00.62]I don't want to get too old.
[30:02.32]One cannot have things overlapping.
[30:04.60]Now then, I believe we... I will be talking about Mampang and your impending death.
[30:12.88]I'm not going to die.
[30:13.64]What are you talking about?
[30:14.84]Oh, you most certainly are.
[30:16.46]Often, I shouldn't wonder.
[30:18.79]He points up.
[30:19.49]The dome is gone, and it is now nighttime.
[30:22.27]Stars shine overhead.
[30:24.57]I like these gardens for one reason above all.
[30:27.33]Can you see what it is?
[30:28.25]I don't see anything.
[30:33.10]He sighs with evident pleasure.
[30:35.18]Look up there, he declares, pointing and proving you quite correct.
[30:39.60]There is one of the only two places in Kare where the stars of the Zed can be spelled out here.
[30:47.08]The other is by the North Gate, but that spot's rather too busy.
[30:53.97]What do you know of that spell?
[30:56.65]The mention of Zed makes you stop short.
[30:59.01]The secret magic, the most powerful knowledge unknown to all.
[31:03.95]What do you know of that spell?
[31:06.25]Zed is the great discovery of the Necromancers.
[31:09.31]A spell powered by and fascinated by death.
[31:13.18]Some thought it prevented death, but it does not.
[31:15.80]Quite the opposite.
[31:16.92]The stars of Zed cause a death of the most significant final kind.
[31:23.10]What was it for?
[31:25.58]The man nods.
[31:27.23]It is a spell of such power and significance that secret must never be divulged.
[31:31.61]I have told you enough in this place, please.
[31:34.71]He gestures at another path leading between trees as wide as bears that have fallen together to form an arch.
[31:40.97]After you.
[31:43.77]Okay.
[31:46.39]You slip under the arch and arrive in a field of bright yellow and purple flowers, terrifically overgrown.
[31:52.12]Bramble choked the edges of the path.
[31:54.10]The man does not follow.
[31:57.78]You call out but hear no response.
[31:59.08]It seems you are quite alone.
[32:00.92]High above you see two harpies flying past, screaming to each other and pointing.
[32:05.84]But they are not coming for you.
[32:09.96]Where did he go?
[32:12.14]You search the bushes but find nothing.
[32:14.10]There is nothing hiding there.
[32:15.92]Nothing waiting for you.
[32:18.36]The beggar has abandoned you.
[32:20.06]It seems you must find the path back to Mampang yourself.
[32:25.43]From part two.
[32:30.20]whatever let's go you push forward through the towering flowers into an area of cracked blue paving and fronded shrubs and glass pots to your relief the beggar is here once more he looks older than ever now you understand now you see why you have to die I think you may have missed something dude
[32:58.55]Possibly.
[32:59.23]It is hard to keep things in the right order when you are cursed as I am.
[33:08.13]You said I was to die.
[33:10.10]You must.
[33:11.42]The Zed spell is difficult to cast, you see, because you can't cast it at once.
[33:16.62]You have to cast it two separate times.
[33:19.06]Two times, but one casting.
[33:21.40]Got it?
[33:22.18]Like left and right hands clashed together.
[33:25.27]He demonstrates, linking thumbs and flapping his fingers like a butterfly.
[33:33.39]Uh, okay.
[33:35.23]You begin now and finish later?
[33:37.82]No, he says, wincing slightly as he speaks.
[33:40.86]I mean, when both castings are cast, they are the same casting.
[33:45.44]Two castings at different times cannot be at different times.
[33:49.18]So the time between disappears.
[33:51.79]He squashes his butterfly flingers into a single two-handed fist.
[33:58.47]Time collapses.
[34:01.83]What is he, what?
[34:03.63]The time collapses.
[34:05.37]Beautifully put.
[34:06.91]The beggar spits a tooth, then picks it up to admire.
[34:11.02]Be valuable that one of these days, he remarks.
[34:15.11]Give me your teeth.
[34:15.99]Give it to me.
[34:17.32]You reach down for it.
[34:19.00]Uncouth villain!
[34:20.66]Batting away your hand, I hit you.
[34:22.88]Now we'd best be getting on.
[34:24.44]We don't want you coming back here when you finally die.
[34:26.76]Alright, this guy's fucking freaking me out.
[34:31.14]You nod.
[34:31.48]Whatever the beggar is talking about, it is simply impossible to follow.
[34:34.48]Throbin closes his dirt-smudged eyes and concentrates.
[34:38.48]And slowly the walls of Mampang return.
[34:42.70]Whoa, we're back here.
[34:48.56]There you are again, smiles the beggar.
[34:51.16]He lifts a crooked finger.
[34:53.10]Not a word.
[34:54.36]There are spies everywhere.
[34:57.14]One last thing to do.
[34:59.21]Draw your sword.
[35:02.73]Why?
[35:04.03]you ask suspiciously.
[35:06.29]It's the sort of thing people do in Mampang.
[35:09.03]Draw it.
[35:11.69]Fine, draw your blade.
[35:12.79]You obediently draw your blade.
[35:14.57]Throbin beams with glee, and then before you can stop him, he runs himself deep onto the blade.
[35:21.77]For the ghosts of the Backlands, I curse you with this, he whispers, and there is a fury in his eyes.
[35:27.55]In the last moments, you see him hurl up his arms, creating some kind of incantation.
[35:32.11]A terrible force builds around his body, but then seems to only half explode.
[35:36.49]You are caught at the moment of detonation.
[35:45.01]The explosion dies away, its force curiously unspent, as though waiting.
[35:49.44]But you feel stronger for it.
[35:54.26]You look around, still disoriented.
[35:56.40]There's no sign of the beggar.
[35:58.04]The narrow alley mouth opens into the square.
[36:01.77]Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.
[36:03.77]Soon it will be dark once more.
[36:04.89]Alright, so that guy just murdered himself on my sword and then disappeared.
[36:12.33]Throbin Lorag.
[36:13.37]Yeah, I know, right?
[36:16.29]I think I might have just gotten swindled.
[36:21.73]Did that go well?
[36:22.55]Alright.
[36:28.66]Yeah, Lorag.
[36:29.34]No, that was Throbin.
[36:31.44]That was Throbin.
[36:34.30]Thank you to Ochre Pact for your subscription and Ding for your subscription as well.
[36:42.92]Let's keep going.
[36:45.02]Into the square.
[36:48.66]You emerge from the alley into the edge of the main square.
[36:53.66]We now have a few different places to go.
[36:59.30]Where do you guys want to go first?
[37:00.68]Let's do a poll.
[37:02.26]Let's poll it up.
[37:03.22]What do you say?
[37:11.74]My computer's going a little slow for my taste.
[37:13.96]There we go.
[37:19.20]Straw pole.
[37:19.86]Alright, we're going to go into the square.
[37:21.72]We're going to go east side or west side.
[37:27.68]Let's go with west side.
[37:29.36]Square.
[37:31.82]Or east side.
[37:38.29]What do you guys want to do first?
[37:40.77]Because it looks like... I mean, whatever happens here... Looks like I'll be going back into here anyways.
[37:49.75]Or will I?
[37:52.39]Or will I?
[37:53.41]Here's the whole map.
[37:53.99]We can go this way, this way, or this way.
[38:05.10]But it looks like...
[38:07.64]Looks like there's enough room to go around here.
[38:09.98]Like this.
[38:12.20]And I have to assume, like all the other games, that we'll be going in this direction at some point.
[38:19.40]Here is the poll.
[38:22.46]Go vote with your hearts content.
[38:31.59]You're currently horribly, violently ill.
[38:33.15]Do I think my stream will cure you?
[38:35.98]I, uh... I don't think so.
[38:39.48]I don't think I can cure all you.
[38:54.45]It looks like West Side seems to be winning.
[38:55.91]Uh, by not a whole lot, so we're gonna give it like another 10 seconds.
[39:03.52]Change my name from Jerma to dumb idiot stupid face.
[39:07.88]That was very specific.
[39:16.15]All I can do is wish you luck.
[39:18.15]Hopefully you get better in your sickness.
[39:22.04]Ooh, it got real close real quick here.
[39:32.48]Only separated by four votes.
[39:35.92]We might have to let this one kind of trickle out.
[39:43.57]Oh, 112 to 113?
[39:47.45]Two votes!
[39:48.47]Two votes!
[39:55.89]Remove the Ralph Nader.
[40:00.46]Oh, it's really fucking close, but...
[40:04.30]117, 115.
[40:09.43]Alright, I'm going to have to close it.
[40:11.09]No, no.
[40:11.99]Oh, 125, 125.
[40:18.07]I'm going to have to close it here.
[40:22.37]I'm counting to... Oh!
[40:25.01]Wow, with a surge.
[40:27.32]Last minute pull.
[40:28.80]Square has taken the lead.
[40:34.27]Oh my god, why is this closed?
[40:38.25]Alright, I'm not kidding.
[40:39.47]Whatever it is at the time of closing, I don't care.
[40:41.44]I don't care what happens after I say the poll is closed.
[40:46.80]We're closing the poll in five seconds.
[40:49.08]Five.
[40:50.40]Four.
[40:51.54]Three.
[40:52.86]Two.
[40:54.20]One.
[40:55.52]Zero.
[40:56.32]At time of closing, it is 150 to 140.
[40:59.22]Square wins.
[41:00.54]Thank you for voting.
[41:01.12]That was damn close.
[41:04.27]That was damn close.
[41:06.27]Thank you for voting.
[41:07.17]Poll is over.
[41:07.97]It's done.
[41:08.87]Square wins.
[41:10.05]Let's move on.
[41:13.20]Let us move on.
[41:15.30]Into the square.
[41:20.89]Another night begins, you should try to find a place to sleep, especially on an empty stomach.
[41:24.55]You stride out into the middle of the public square where Manpang's inhabitants go about their business.
[41:29.95]In the center is a huge statue of a faceless man holding a crown aloft.
[41:34.97]The Archmage.
[41:35.71]Okay.
[41:41.85]Look at the statue.
[41:42.49]Let's look at it.
[41:43.93]The statue seems unimaginably old, and yet the Archmage as depicted here is definitely holding the crown of kings.
[41:50.68]Has he been planning this theft for such a long time then?
[41:53.98]Or is this prophecy a celebration of a day destined to come?
[42:00.78]I'm going to go to bed.
[42:03.34]You curl up against the base of the statue and pull your cloak up over your body.
[42:08.02]Laying your pack down, you try to rest under your habit despite the strange noises that drift through the air.
[42:13.40]You've eaten nothing today and you have ample provisions remaining.
[42:18.51]I'm not eating a damn thing.
[42:20.03]It's a waste.
[42:21.47]Because I will... No, not eating.
[42:24.47]Don't eat.
[42:26.22]You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[42:29.72]Dream.
[42:31.92]What the hell was that, Otto?
[42:35.20]He just looked at me and went, What?
[42:39.82]What?
[42:40.00]Should I have eaten?
[42:40.56]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[42:41.92]Yeah, it's a good dog.
[42:43.76]I know.
[42:44.02]Okay.
[42:45.70]Okay.
[42:47.99]What is left of the night is restless with visions.
[42:51.23]You are curled up on a bed of straw and bones.
[42:54.24]A bird maid is carefully plucking grit from your skin and nuzzling you with its cruel hooked beak.
[43:00.66]You are safe, warm.
[43:03.24]She feeds you with still living rabbit.
[43:05.82]A pair of rich black eyes are fixed on you.
[43:08.92]A figure in shadow purrs your name.
[43:11.38]The voice is rich, beautiful, and compelling.
[43:15.97]Flanker, my love,
[43:18.32]I am here for you.
[43:20.46]I will take your hand.
[43:22.99]And all the while, you hear distant laughter from the east.
[43:27.15]Alright, we gained provisions.
[43:39.90]Head to the Citadel and we're cursed with the Zed spell.
[43:43.06]What?
[43:43.90]Wait, wait, wait, what?
[43:45.96]Wait, what?
[43:48.12]The Archmage is now aware of you.
[43:51.86]Sure thing.
[43:57.50]Okay, you wake to the sound of people in tramping guards that hurry to your feet once more.
[44:01.90]Look around, cast a spell, make a move.
[44:08.02]What can I even do for a spell here?
[44:12.50]East came back to bite you, so he's just laughing from the east somewhere.
[44:17.92]How?
[44:18.72]Find safe passage.
[44:25.93]Sense danger.
[44:26.89]Let's go ahead and do it.
[44:30.09]You cast the spell in a steady voice because to speak to you, you receive a strong feeling of trepidation about the alley to the east.
[44:38.08]There are guards patrolling frequently even here.
[44:40.40]You will have to be careful to blend in, especially with the citadel on alert.
[44:45.38]So east was like death, apparently.
[44:47.86]What else can I do here in the middle of the town center?
[44:58.23]Rap?
[44:58.53]Talk all languages?
[44:59.67]Can I talk to the statue?
[45:03.65]Resurrect the dead?
[45:04.43]Yeah.
[45:07.69]East side sucks.
[45:08.39]Hey, I'm from the east side.
[45:09.79]How dare you?
[45:12.33]Let's see the future.
[45:12.83]Lizzy Orb.
[45:16.94]You settle into a sitting position on the ground and take out the Orb of Crystal.
[45:20.13]Looking to the stars, you craft the magic and suddenly you find yourself somewhere quite new.
[45:24.11]You stand amongst broken towers that rise from churning waters.
[45:28.21]From one tower rises a cloud of foul gas.
[45:31.46]Another crawls with goblins whose long knives cut into one another.
[45:35.56]Starlight charges from one building to another forming a powerful web.
[45:38.84]The vision fades.
[45:41.18]Being so near the gates means there is a greater number of merchants and travelers here.
[45:45.89]The further into the keep you go, the inhabitants will become increasingly wary of outsiders.
[45:51.59]Okay.
[45:53.73]Thank you, Invishand.
[45:56.09]Go to the casino.
[45:59.27]Is somebody trying to do a Tinder command?
[46:01.79]I hope there's no Tinder command.
[46:08.15]Let's make a move.
[46:09.81]You can head in several directions.
[46:11.71]Oh, boy.
[46:14.59]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[46:15.81]Okay.
[46:17.01]Well.
[46:21.65]Jesus.
[46:29.14]I'm either going to go up here or... Well, this is the gate to the... The Archmage is in here.
[46:40.16]We're going straight in.
[46:41.46]Fuck it.
[46:41.92]Let's go.
[46:44.43]This section is dominated by a wide road that leads upwards into the inner tower.
[46:48.91]Guards flank the way, scowling at anyone who gets too close.
[46:52.67]Nearby, you also spy a pillory with a lone prisoner shackled in.
[46:56.87]A bustling market is in full swing further north.
[46:59.39]The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[47:04.60]Pillar.
[47:07.83]You walk over to the pillory, behind it a gallows looms, noose swaying in the breeze.
[47:13.93]Oh shit.
[47:15.19]A prisoner is here, dressed in rags.
[47:17.09]The skin on his neck and wrists has been rubbed raw by the wood.
[47:20.94]He lifts his head just enough to scowl as you approach.
[47:25.66]Okay.
[47:26.86]He is brawny, but thinned by the punishment.
[47:28.96]His shaggy hair is covered in filth, clumping together in places.
[47:34.29]He's surprisingly lucid for somebody who has spent a week in the stock, so I'm gonna cough.
[47:38.72]Ugh.
[47:38.86]Master Toaster.
[47:39.62]Love you, streaming videos.
[47:40.82]You're a goof and a half.
[47:42.10]Love you, Jerma's son.
[48:04.42]Well, Master Toaster, I love you back.
[48:07.32]Thanks for sticking around.
[48:09.38]All these years.
[48:12.42]That's ten bucks.
[48:14.84]Why is he talking out of a bucket?
[48:17.78]Give him some food.
[48:18.58]Offer to free him.
[48:19.41]Taunt him.
[48:19.93]What are you going to do in that pillory, you fucking wanker?
[48:25.93]Free him.
[48:27.13]I could free you.
[48:28.39]He raises his eyebrows.
[48:30.83]Could you?
[48:31.85]But why would you?
[48:33.43]So you won't.
[48:36.92]uh maybe in return for some information whatever I can tell you I will but frankly quickly before someone notices I pulled the wood you tug at the wood but it is firm smash the lock you bash at the lock with the handle of your sword but it does nothing the padlock holds cast a spell
[49:06.17]I can't zap it.
[49:07.65]Zop?
[49:08.67]Well, pop.
[49:09.35]Create explosions?
[49:10.93]Wait.
[49:14.94]Zap?
[49:15.38]I could zap him.
[49:16.44]I could zap the lock.
[49:22.16]No!
[49:23.10]No!
[49:24.06]You move the starlight, building a formidable electric force in your head.
[49:27.25]I have to kill him.
[49:28.69]No!
[49:30.67]No, he's trapped.
[49:37.00]I'm so kill him No You point at the man and release the lightning bolt a moment later the pillory is a smoking ruin There's nothing more to be done.
[49:51.87]You leave the gruesome sight at the pillory behind You could head out into the square.
[49:55.99]Why the fuck did I do that?
[50:01.73]I can't even rewind.
[50:04.00]Why did I do that shit?
[50:09.00]Oh, motherfucker.
[50:09.92]That, like, wasn't even funny.
[50:13.22]No, that guy... Okay.
[50:18.33]Bye.
[50:18.61]I just fucking electrocuted a guy that was tied up in stalks for no reason.
[50:29.52]That did nothing for me.
[50:30.34]It just killed a guy.
[50:30.98]That's it.
[50:33.68]I'm not doing that again.
[50:35.93]I'm not doing that shit again.
[50:37.85]I can guarantee you.
[50:42.07]Zap?
[50:42.85]We're done with the zap.
[50:43.81]I'm putting zap in the fucking pocket and closing it.
[50:48.93]We're not casting zap at another person again.
[50:51.88]I promise.
[50:54.24]If there's an opportunity to do it, I'm not gonna do it.
[50:56.54]No more fucking zapping.
[51:00.54]I threw three stamina away to disintegrate a prisoner.
[51:08.33]The air stirs a little still cold, but fresh fuck a few yards from the square a group of guards block the road They stand sharpened to attention Sheltering in the shade of a nearby hut two of them hold snarling dogs on chains Never saved me Don't lie to me you know you will no more zap unfollowed It's the signature spell
[51:39.72]Yeah, but all it does is kill people.
[51:41.47]It doesn't even, like... I gotta get some self-control, man.
[51:46.29]I could have zapped the lock and probably freed him.
[51:50.11]It was just dumb.
[51:53.71]Alright, let's look at the guards.
[51:55.83]Okay.
[52:10.10]Thank you, Skorita, for your sub.
[52:12.84]And thank you also to Wiley Spencer, a wild Spencer.
[52:16.46]For three months, welcome back.
[52:19.16]Baked Flakes, that was fixed.
[52:21.21]1500 bits by Baked Flakes.
[52:24.49]And Banana Slamma Jr., thank you for five months.
[52:28.65]And of course, Master Toaster as well, thank you guys.
[52:32.35]Welcome back to the channel.
[52:35.08]Okay.
[52:35.18]Okay.
[52:36.27]We're going to... Look at the road.
[52:39.79]The road is wide and clear.
[52:41.03]Why the fuck did I zap that guy?
[52:42.65]Seriously.
[52:45.73]I can't even get over it.
[52:46.81]I'm still fucking mad about that.
[52:49.56]The road is wide and clear with a rising rock on one side and a drop on the other.
[52:53.12]There are no places to hide.
[52:55.22]One of the guards spies you and stamps forward.
[52:58.38]The nearest comes out to greet you with a growl.
[53:01.26]Well, the guard snaps.
[53:05.03]Why are there so many guards?
[53:10.43]To stop the likes of you from coming past.
[53:13.32]That's a woman.
[53:14.50]To stop the likes of you from coming past.
[53:18.64]Where does this road go?
[53:21.06]Where does this road lead?
[53:23.32]You what?
[53:24.38]The inner fortress.
[53:25.36]Can't you see it?
[53:29.38]Get out of my fucking way!
[53:30.80]Push back!
[53:31.40]You shove her suddenly, but she doesn't topple over and simply shoves back.
[53:35.10]The guard crosses her arm, scowling at you.
[53:37.62]Other guards mill about nearby.
[53:39.04]Get out of my fucking way!
[53:42.12]This time you use your full weight and shoulder barge the guard, throwing her back.
[53:45.94]Then you break into a run.
[53:47.86]But in your long monk's habit, you cannot run very fast.
[53:51.06]Give me the fuck up that road!
[53:54.40]You are running up the incline of the road as fast as you can.
[53:56.89]The guards are hot on your heels.
[53:58.01]Then you trip.
[54:00.65]Roll aside.
[54:01.57]You roll just as two guards leap and they land on empty Earth, giving you enough time to get back to your feet.
[54:06.70]Keep running.
[54:07.74]The breath is short and hot in your lungs, but you keep going.
[54:10.32]There is no alternative.
[54:11.73]With a bit of luck, there'll be somewhere to hide around the corner.
[54:14.03]Go, go, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[54:17.49]The road turns.
[54:18.39]Your legs are like fire, but you hear the guards in their heavy armor are beginning to tire.
[54:24.11]The road ends in a small wooden door built into a wooden palisade.
[54:28.37]What is that word?
[54:29.85]The door appears unguarded.
[54:31.37]Footsteps are coming closer.
[54:33.97]Climb it.
[54:34.79]Climb it.
[54:37.49]You haul yourself up using the rivets in the wood to climb, but you cannot climb faster enough.
[54:41.85]The guards appear around the corner and launch themselves upon you.
[54:44.39]You are trussed up and hauled away.
[54:50.52]Ah, what?
[54:53.16]Bound and gagged, you are dragged by your ankles by two guards who mutter about the trouble caused.
[54:59.20]They gossip to passing companions about you.
[55:01.68]I'll give you money.
[55:04.74]I've got 20 gold pieces.
[55:08.30]Cast a spell.
[55:10.16]You try to cast a spell, but with your arms tied, you cannot reach for the starlight you require.
[55:15.27]Should they untie you at any point, then you will have a chance, but not before.
[55:19.63]Hopelessly, you are dragged into the office of the Commander of the Guard.
[55:22.68]The room is windowless, but lit by a half dozen lamps scattered about.
[55:35.76]Khartoum, Commander of the Guards of Mampang, sits behind a wooden desk covered in scattered parchments.
[55:42.33]Hello there.
[55:43.53]You open your mouth to speak, but one of the guards smacks you in the cheek, silencing you.
[55:49.51]The Anor Lander.
[55:51.09]Standing right before me?
[55:54.65]I should have you killed as fast as possible.
[55:58.29]You try it!
[56:00.20]He stares back at you and you see fear creeping in his eyes.
[56:04.40]They tell the strangest stories about you.
[56:07.12]They say, for instance, that you're over a thousand years old.
[56:11.24]They say it was you that ravaged the world outside these walls, though I do not know if that could be true.
[56:20.07]What do you believe?
[56:23.53]In the end, I'm a soldier.
[56:25.37]I believe I can run you through with a sword, and if you get up again afterwards, I believe I can run you through again.
[56:32.26]I believe that if I toss you into our highest cell, you will not fly away.
[56:39.49]If you kill me, I will come back for you.
[56:46.16]He holds your gaze for a moment and then laughs.
[56:51.44]Well now, you really are as black-hearted as they say, aren't you?
[56:57.19]We better then put this immortality of yours to the test.
[57:01.91]Guards, take him to the block and don't waste another moment of my time.
[57:10.05]Wait, what?
[57:11.51]Just fucking stop swinging.
[57:15.25]You whip your sword from your scabbard before anyone can stop you.
[57:18.41]The first of the guards drops to the floor, but you cannot hope to overpower all of them.
[57:22.81]They soon have your arms twisted up behind your back.
[57:26.05]The commander is grimacing.
[57:28.75]Get this one out of my office.
[57:31.13]Remove his head and bring it back to me.
[57:34.65]I need somewhere to keep my pencils.
[57:40.29]No!
[57:41.59]The chopping block.
[57:47.01]Your head bumps over the cobblestones as you are dragged up to a rough wooden block.
[57:51.99]A massive man, shirtless but masked, lounges in the shadow of the wall with an axe.
[57:57.76]The guards call him over.
[58:00.04]Welcome, he says, spreading his arms.
[58:02.90]Always nice to see a new face.
[58:05.70]What would your name be, then?
[58:07.04]Hate to have a face without a name.
[58:12.85]I am the Annalander.
[58:16.17]The Annalander?
[58:17.93]What an honor for me.
[58:19.07]I have heard quite a bit about you.
[58:21.91]Caused some trouble, I'm told.
[58:24.55]Well, good for you.
[58:25.92]Here's an end to your journey, then.
[58:28.76]Suddenly, the man falls silent, looking up at the tower above as though something had caught his attention.
[58:38.84]Look up.
[58:41.14]You turn and look, but see nothing but the sunlight gleaming off a high tower window.
[58:47.03]Yes, my lord.
[58:48.09]At once, my lord.
[58:49.45]The large man says to the empty air.
[58:51.55]Then he turns back to you.
[58:54.13]The order's given.
[58:55.43]It, well, it doesn't look good for you.
[58:58.71]He scoops you up and positions you on the block, securing an iron band around the base of your neck.
[59:05.84]Let's talk about this.
[59:08.71]As he readies his blade, you have time for maybe one last question.
[59:13.75]How do I get in the tower?
[59:23.10]Why would I ask?
[59:23.86]What's the greatest treasure?
[59:29.78]Okay, what's the easiest thing?
[59:32.39]Okay.
[59:36.08]Where's the greatest treasure in all of Banpeng?
[59:40.18]The executioner nods sagely.
[59:42.62]The vaults.
[59:44.82]But thing is, no one knows where the vaults are.
[59:48.12]I reckon somewhere in the city.
[59:49.66]Just somewhere no one wants to go.
[59:52.12]Then he swings up the enormous axe.
[59:54.83]You hear the singing as it slices the air.
[59:59.31]Come on, pray.
[60:01.57]Prey, you close your eyes and whisper a quiet prayer.
[60:05.57]The edge of the axe gleams in the sun.
[60:08.17]Look on the bright side, he remarks, blade quivering in the air.
[60:12.11]Not every day the Archmage comes to watch me work.
[60:15.90]A moment before the axe falls, you see from the corner of your eye that someone has come to watch.
[60:21.76]A tiny dwarf figure leading on a staff.
[60:25.66]The Executioner greets the newcomer.
[60:28.36]Evening there.
[60:29.60]One of yours, is he?
[60:34.62]Uh... I'm gonna look up.
[60:38.90]You twist your neck as far as you can and peer from the corner of your eyes.
[60:43.84]Cut clean!
[60:45.20]Request the newcomer.
[60:46.70]A tidy slice below the chin.
[60:49.37]For myself, I only wish for the limb.
[60:54.57]Wait a minute.
[60:54.97]That's... That's... Is that VanCast?
[60:58.49]He's coming to get the leg!
[61:00.59]He's coming to get my leg!
[61:05.04]It is bad.
[61:05.62]Bad cast.
[61:07.67]All journeys end, all plans are mislaid, and every price is eventually paid.
[61:13.91]The axe comes down.
[61:16.75]You've been executed.
[61:21.70]What?
[61:23.34]Why is he here?
[61:24.28]Why the fuck?
[61:29.42]Ugh.
[61:30.82]You feel the cold veil of death surrounding you, but a moment later you found yourself moving.
[61:37.18]Upwards.
[61:52.49]Oh, it's Zed.
[61:54.19]We cast Zed.
[61:55.63]We're gonna, yeah, alright.
[61:59.06]You do not cast the spell, but rather it casts you, pulling you open only to scatter you into the winds.
[62:08.11]Yep, okay.
[62:14.74]Okay, now I, I, alright, yep.
[62:21.65]You are being wrenched in directions you did not know existed.
[62:24.54]The pain is unbearable, and just when you think you will go mad from it, the forces tear you apart.
[62:29.48]Then you hit the ground in one piece, in the thin alleyway leading from the grate.
[62:34.18]It is where you met the beggar, but he's nowhere to be seen.
[62:37.88]You've lost one point of maximum stamina.
[62:45.52]You pat yourself down, you're quite alive.
[62:48.08]What is more, you have all your possessions and gold and knowledge intact.
[62:52.05]The narrow alley mouth opens into the square.
[62:54.25]Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.
[62:57.45]Soon it'll be dark once more.
[63:03.15]No rewinds.
[63:04.91]Except I'm back here now, into the square.
[63:09.54]Do I still have my leg?
[63:12.72]You emerge from the alley into the edge of the main square.
[63:19.84]Alright, well, obviously... Hold on.
[63:24.93]Into the square.
[63:25.53]I'm curious.
[63:28.11]Another night begins.
[63:29.39]You should try to find a place to sleep, especially on an empty stomach.
[63:31.95]You stride out into the middle of the public square where Manpang's inhabitants go about their business.
[63:36.40]Here's the statue, the Archmage, again.
[63:43.18]Please don't nuke the guy in the pillory.
[63:46.50]Alright, sleep again.
[63:47.74]I'm gonna sleep.
[63:48.08]I'm gonna do the same thing.
[63:49.64]You curl up against the base of the statue and pull your cloak above your body.
[63:52.94]Laying your pack down.
[63:53.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[63:54.63]Okay, I'm gonna eat something this time.
[63:57.21]You eat some cheese and then you dream.
[64:01.51]What is left of the night is restless with visions.
[64:05.19]You are lying on cool, moist ground underneath a tall, swaying tree.
[64:08.96]There is a nagging pain in your leg and you look down to see a sapling growing up through your thigh.
[64:16.01]Rip it out.
[64:17.83]You try to pull it free, but every tug makes you scream in agony as though you were pulling at your own tendons.
[64:23.43]All the while, you hear a distant laughter from the east.
[64:31.12]You lost max stamina, ate prisoners, died, found one clue.
[64:38.00]So, I've got... I'm back to where I was before.
[64:41.16]Alright.
[64:44.50]So, make a move.
[64:50.14]Is this guy gonna be here again?
[64:51.38]I think he has to be, right?
[64:53.26]Everything seems to be back to, like, normal.
[64:57.44]The pillory.
[64:57.88]Let's see.
[65:00.68]Yeah.
[65:00.90]This guy's, like, here again.
[65:01.89]So, what?
[65:02.23]It just, like, rewinds time?
[65:03.77]It's a full rewind.
[65:04.75]Okay.
[65:05.95]I understand.
[65:08.41]You walk over to the pillory behind the gallo looms noose.
[65:10.55]Yeah, yeah.
[65:10.91]Yeah, it's this guy.
[65:11.81]He's... Alright.
[65:15.53]Do not zap this guy.
[65:19.88]Do the same thing.
[65:26.14]No, okay.
[65:26.70]I'm gonna free him this time.
[65:29.98]I want information.
[65:32.23]Alright.
[65:33.05]Cast a spell.
[65:34.43]I'm not going to fucking break this.
[65:38.61]Not break this.
[65:39.13]I'm not going to break this... Zap this guy.
[65:42.49]I want to break this.
[65:43.41]Stop.
[65:51.26]You cast the spell, the spell is formed, but the lock itself refuses to budge.
[65:55.27]The lock is... The lock is infused with minimite blood.
[65:59.11]Makes it impervious to magic.
[66:01.23]With a mutter, he adds, Wish someone had bathed the bloody archmage in that stuff as a baby.
[66:08.90]So, I can't... Alright.
[66:19.53]Nope.
[66:22.20]So if it's impervious to magic, then I'm not... Can I even... Pep?
[66:27.66]Cause strength?
[66:28.44]I don't have fire water.
[66:32.79]Great explosions.
[66:38.43]I feel like that's just gonna kill him.
[66:40.73]What about Raz?
[66:45.67]Sharpen blade.
[66:46.47]I could try that.
[66:52.37]I'm gonna try that.
[66:53.21]I have plenty of beeswax.
[66:54.39]Let's try to sharpen the blade.
[66:56.78]And just break it open.
[67:00.94]Using a little of your beeswax, you coat the edge of your broadsword and then cast your spell.
[67:04.86]The blade flashes and glows as the metal binds itself tighter into a razor blade edge.
[67:11.69]Cut through the pillory, cut through the lock.
[67:15.85]Cut through the pillory.
[67:18.05]You cut the pillory itself, slicing through the wood around the lock with a whisper.
[67:22.46]The lock and chunk of wood falls to the ground.
[67:26.02]The gleam on your sword edge fades.
[67:27.86]The prisoner is free.
[67:29.30]He rubs his wrists and thanks you profusely.
[67:32.84]Alright.
[67:33.74]Info, buddy.
[67:35.50]You follow the prisoner as he skulks down beyond the wooden frame out of sight from the square.
[67:42.64]Thank you again.
[67:43.44]I will remember this.
[67:46.41]I'm thinking you're a stranger here.
[67:48.46]No citizen of the fortress would show such kindness.
[67:51.42]I can tell you what I know of this place.
[67:56.81]Who are you?
[67:58.71]Just a laborer.
[67:59.95]No one important.
[68:01.31]I worked too hard, then complained too much of the tavern.
[68:04.25]So I ended up here.
[68:06.71]What was your crime?
[68:08.71]Plotting.
[68:09.83]They caught me plotting.
[68:11.37]Against him upstairs.
[68:14.86]Plotting?
[68:16.96]Plotting with who?
[68:19.29]No one, really.
[68:20.99]I was just in the bony hand, saying that maybe it'd be good if he showed his face around here a little.
[68:26.19]Gave us all a bit of pep.
[68:28.35]But any kind of talk like that isn't straight talk.
[68:30.55]It's bent talk.
[68:31.79]That's what they say.
[68:33.35]I've learned my lesson.
[68:34.21]Won't do it again.
[68:35.03]Who turned you in?
[68:39.08]No one did.
[68:40.24]The Archmage is watching, see?
[68:42.04]Watching everything.
[68:43.64]He knows what you're going to do before you do it.
[68:46.34]And then Birdman swoop, and then that's it.
[68:49.33]They say there's only one place in the whole fortress you can be, and he won't see what you're doing.
[68:54.78]And that's by them big doors up the steps of the tower.
[68:58.58]He can't point his telescope there or something.
[69:00.84]I don't fucking know.
[69:02.76]Only the guards go up to the bottom of the spike.
[69:05.58]He is rather agitated by this point.
[69:08.06]I appreciate this, but I must flee.
[69:10.33]As soon as they notice I'm gone, I will be hunted.
[69:13.03]Farewell.
[69:15.83]Wait, tell me something useful.
[69:21.32]Uh... Good luck to you!
[69:26.92]He nods at that, then ducks down an alley.
[69:28.46]You could head out into the square or cut across the guarded road that heads uphill from here.
[69:31.46]Alright, well last time I barreled through and that didn't really work.
[69:40.00]So, let's go... Let's go this way.
[69:49.12]Clues!
[69:51.39]You head back to the north side of the square.
[69:52.79]This section is dominated by a wide road that leads upwards towards the inner tower.
[69:56.96]Guards flank the way, scowling at anyone who gets too close.
[70:00.16]Nearby is the pillory.
[70:01.46]A bustling market is in full swing further north.
[70:05.42]Market.
[70:09.24]The market is busy with traders and stalls, a city in miniature.
[70:12.88]The market is not as large as those you encountered in Kare, but still it bustles with life.
[70:17.92]Even in Mampang, people need to go about their days.
[70:22.11]The stalls, the tents.
[70:26.23]This, like, scared me.
[70:29.53]The stalls.
[70:30.75]I got lots of money.
[70:33.20]Most of the stalls are mundane, roughly made household goods and some trinkets.
[70:37.40]Despite the number of shoppers, there are in fact very few goods.
[70:41.06]But as you wander the stands, you do spot a weapons dealer flaunting his wares, and a bent-backed peddler with unusual items spread on a cloth.
[70:52.46]New weapon?
[70:58.07]You approach the weapon stall.
[70:59.63]The trader is extraordinarily thin.
[71:01.21]He might disappear if he turns sideways.
[71:04.51]Welcome, friend.
[71:05.99]The army has procured most of my goods, but I have a few items left to sell for my original stock.
[71:13.31]What do you have?
[71:15.31]I can see you're a seasoned one, so I won't waste your time with the lumps of common soldier get stuck with.
[71:20.75]I have this long sword, which is yours for 25 pieces.
[71:23.89]And the best sword in my possession is this cutlass for 600 pieces.
[71:27.67]600?
[71:28.49]Of course.
[71:29.29]At these prices, you are practically robbing me.
[71:32.01]But then so has everyone in this place.
[71:35.67]600 gold pieces for this cutlass.
[71:37.29]You're way too expensive.
[71:39.21]He shakes his head.
[71:40.79]This is the best you'll find in this fortress.
[71:43.21]I'm nearly destitute thanks to Nihilok.
[71:46.09]I cannot go any lower.
[71:48.77]but six hundred gold pieces.
[71:52.95]This is no ordinary cutlass.
[71:55.11]The edge is unbreakable, the weight perfect.
[71:57.67]The blade cannot be dropped or slipped from the hand.
[71:59.97]It cannot miss.
[72:01.39]This blade will make you all but invincible.
[72:04.11]Spit in my mouth.
[72:06.29]It's pretty good, see?
[72:07.17]Give me a better deal.
[72:10.80]Friend, this morning a beast man was so upset about the price, he threatened me with the very sword I was trying to sell him.
[72:17.50]I can see you have a lot to learn about haggling in Mampang.
[72:21.42]You've seen enough, you nod to the trader.
[72:26.06]Were you not from Mampang?
[72:27.08]I don't understand.
[72:28.54]I don't get you.
[72:30.78]There are safer trade routes, yes, I know.
[72:33.76]But as a bald young man, I heard that the Archmage was offering a fortune for weapons.
[72:38.04]The trader waves his hand vaguely.
[72:40.26]Outfitting a new army or something, I'm not so sure.
[72:43.46]Of course, once I got here, well, you know, you know, well... You know, that snake Nylock would only pay me half.
[72:52.75]And left me stuck on the wrong side of the wall.
[72:56.69]But what could I do?
[72:58.27]If I tried to leave some bird man, would have no doubt swooped down, and that would have been the end of it.
[73:03.12]At least I'm in a state to appreciate my poverty.
[73:06.54]But what can I do for you?
[73:09.32]Nylok.
[73:11.14]He makes a rude noise.
[73:12.78]Zap him and steal his sword.
[73:30.04]Oh indeed, though I certainly couldn't tell you who they're supposed to be fighting.
[73:33.87]Everyone outside the walls is now dead, or so they say.
[73:36.25]Now are you gonna buy something or are you gonna get out of my fucking face?
[73:40.39]Bye.
[73:43.63]Peddler.
[73:46.70]The peddler smiles as you approach, and he gestures across a motley collection of objects laid out on a blanket.
[73:52.38]There's chipped pottery, dull knives, and empty picture frames.
[73:56.14]The man is not old, but a hard life has aged his looks.
[74:01.74]Junk, refuse, and memorabilia.
[74:04.12]All for the discerning customer.
[74:07.58]Ooh, I can sell my gems here.
[74:11.20]Offer to sell gems.
[74:13.74]Do you buy as well?
[74:14.74]I have gems for sale.
[74:16.90]Gems?
[74:18.26]No.
[74:19.06]No point in me buying gems.
[74:21.16]What would happen if I put them on my rug out here?
[74:23.08]What do you think?
[74:24.14]Would I make my money back?
[74:25.26]Don't think so.
[74:29.04]Yeah, they're enough to escape man-pang.
[74:32.01]and be free, you murmur below your breath.
[74:35.32]No!
[74:36.14]I don't need to see them to know that they're not.
[74:39.58]Who can I sell these to?
[74:42.02]Try Hummingbird, the weapons dealer.
[74:43.50]He's nuts.
[74:45.14]That guy told me to fuck off.
[74:49.52]What's he got?
[74:51.36]You nod, smiling at the man's whimsy.
[74:53.46]So, going to buy anything, he asks.
[74:56.02]You look at his assortment of junk, you can see a few items that might be useful.
[75:01.98]Brass pendulum.
[75:03.50]Gold-backed mirror.
[75:04.72]Okay, what items do I not have here?
[75:08.64]Give the Jerma Gems to the Cutlass guy?
[75:12.39]Could I... Was there even an opportunity to do that?
[75:19.65]If I... It looked like he just wouldn't want to tell me fucking his life story.
[75:25.50]Um... Which one of these do I not have?
[75:30.60]Blimberry...
[75:33.64]Some glue.
[75:34.26]Alright, how much?
[75:40.48]Viola potion, fresh.
[75:41.82]Fresh enough.
[75:42.24]18 gold pieces.
[75:43.58]Are you shitting me?
[75:44.72]No way.
[75:47.90]You seen any blimp?
[75:48.70]No, I'm not gonna buy that for 18 gold.
[75:50.50]I have three rations.
[75:51.58]Get out of town.
[75:54.94]No.
[75:55.64]Fuck this guy.
[75:56.16]I'm going back.
[75:57.54]I can sell that to the guy?
[75:59.08]What?
[76:01.93]Oh, alright.
[76:02.47]I have the option to.
[76:03.39]Do you buy gemstones, buddy?
[76:06.62]I was told you might.
[76:08.66]I might.
[76:09.10]May I see?
[76:09.94]Perhaps a trade in kind?
[76:13.24]Oh, gems for a sword?
[76:14.88]Gems for a sword.
[76:17.28]How about this?
[76:17.96]He lifts a cutlass from the mat.
[76:19.95]Really is my finest blade.
[76:21.17]You know, strong, supple perfection.
[76:27.01]What if this thing's a piece of shit?
[76:30.53]Let's do it.
[76:32.63]You take the blade and hand over the gems.
[76:33.95]The sword is truly magnificent.
[76:35.53]You've never held anything like it.
[76:38.83]The merchant nods with evident pleasure.
[76:40.73]Very well.
[76:41.31]Alright, well, let me look at that thing.
[76:44.55]Are you shitting me?
[76:47.97]Cutlass plus six!
[76:49.15]Holy god.
[76:54.71]A plus six cutlass?
[76:59.27]That'll do.
[77:05.23]Yeah, I'm glad I could get rid of the gems, to be honest.
[77:08.23]I stole them from, uh... Cougar, whatever his name was, like fucking 30 hours ago.
[77:18.51]Oh, PogChamp.
[77:21.07]Okay, there are a few large tents set up, and some stone buildings too.
[77:24.64]There's a hawker loudly proclaiming that mysteries and wonders await in his tent.
[77:29.06]In one corner, a long line of creatures queue outside a low stone building.
[77:39.79]Fortune teller or the hawker?
[77:40.93]Let's go to the hawker.
[77:47.88]I can't get over this guy in my ear going... You walk by the hawker who is plying her tray to the crowd.
[77:56.76]Examine the wondrous stone of secrets.
[77:59.22]Marvel as it speaks, advises, and prophesizes.
[78:03.02]Talk to her.
[78:04.68]You approach the hawker who points right at you.
[78:07.54]Now here is a discerning patron of the weird and wonderful.
[78:10.68]Will he enter and experience the mysteries that even our best magical knowledge cannot explain?
[78:14.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[78:18.28]How much?
[78:20.78]You may enter for the astonishingly small sum of two gold pieces.
[78:24.11]What a bargain!
[78:25.17]What a steal!
[78:26.47]Only two.
[78:26.97]Yes, two gold pieces for an entertaining, enlightening, life-changing experience.
[78:33.63]I can afford that, so I... What is it?
[78:37.13]She puffs herself up.
[78:39.45]The Stone of Secrets is an incredibly rare artifact discovered deep within a lost cave of many moons ago.
[78:45.38]It is the only stone in the world which can speak.
[78:48.04]It is not powered by magic, but a strange alien force unique in the old world.
[78:52.72]The greatest magicians of our age have examined it and walked away confounded.
[79:01.52]Let's do it.
[79:03.02]You pay the fee and the hawker beams, her gaze already slipping past you.
[79:07.53]Here is a brave soul who has chosen to embrace mystery and wonder who will follow him.
[79:13.29]Let's see what it is.
[79:16.31]Inside the tent, it is dim and cramped.
[79:19.10]A large stack of boxes sits to one side, a cloth draped over them.
[79:23.44]Other curiosities, no doubt, that the hawker has shelved in favor of the more profitable stone.
[79:30.25]Search the boxes.
[79:31.89]You begin to rifle through the boxes when suddenly you're stopped short.
[79:34.85]Then a voice booms through the tent.
[79:37.53]ANALANDA!
[79:40.07]A familiar voice.
[79:41.47]The voice is familiar, but quite impossible.
[79:44.23]It is the booming tone of Shadrach, the hermit from the backlands.
[79:52.42]This is a trick.
[79:54.63]Alas, no trick, replies the voice happily.
[79:57.97]A fairly poor outcome for me, I'll warrant, but no trick.
[80:03.82]Shadrach?
[80:05.38]Yes, it is I. It is good to see you again.
[80:09.66]After a fashion, at least.
[80:13.84]Why is he a rock?
[80:16.06]What happened?
[80:17.80]I bound a piece of my spirit to this rock.
[80:20.16]A desperate move.
[80:22.41]That's the tree I burnt down, by the way.
[80:24.29]I will avenge you.
[80:44.56]I thank you, but you must forget about the troubles of an old man.
[80:48.18]Focus on your mission.
[80:49.76]Without the crown, my suffering will pale in comparison to that of the old world.
[80:56.87]Can I, like, get him out of the rock?
[80:59.75]Ah, no.
[81:00.99]It is best you put me out of your mind.
[81:03.03]Your own task is all that matters.
[81:09.22]Uh, can you help me?
[81:12.45]I only hope I can help.
[81:14.07]I am but a rock.
[81:15.59]The stone dulls in color a touch, as though it sighed.
[81:20.31]But all I have learned of Mangpang has made my heart heavier.
[81:30.23]How do I reach the Archmage?
[81:32.93]You must enter the Sorcerer's Spike, but its doors have never opened.
[81:36.96]They were made by the necromancer Throben.
[81:39.54]Locked in three ways and then sealed in a fourth.
[81:42.38]The last seal was a bind that required he took his life.
[81:46.04]But the only power that can defeat the crown lies behind those doors.
[81:52.88]What about the vaults?
[81:55.34]The stone would shake its head if it had a head to shake.
[81:58.22]Nothing!
[81:59.02]But the crown will not be in any vault.
[82:01.04]It is too precious for that.
[82:04.67]Sense danger?
[82:09.86]What can you tell me about the city?
[82:13.02]Mampang the city holds a thousand captive souls, all of whom are subservient to the Archmage's will, though he rarely chooses to employ them.
[82:21.39]People here wander around their lives like rain through channels in a rock.
[82:25.56]The rock rattles and then falls still for a time.
[82:28.90]I am sorry, Anor Lander.
[82:30.84]I lack the strength to continue speaking.
[82:33.80]My body has already failed, and my spirit cannot stay anchored to this rock forever.
[82:39.23]Keep your wits about you, and know that... that I am proud.
[82:43.07]No!
[82:51.30]Shadrach!
[82:52.90]Outside the tent, the Hawker claps you on the shoulder.
[82:55.29]Well, friend, did the stone unlock the mysteries of the universe for you?
[82:58.29]Did it dazzle your senses, delight your spirit?
[83:02.69]You are exploiting that creature.
[83:06.39]Of course not.
[83:07.51]How could I do that?
[83:08.43]It's a rock.
[83:09.47]It needs only visitors, but that mission requires donations, you see, as there are a variety of expenses.
[83:15.12]The Hawker's words flow like oil, slippery yet empty.
[83:18.60]You leave mid-sentence.
[83:21.88]Walk away.
[83:24.38]Now, let me look at the clues so far.
[83:25.44]Let's take a look at the clues.
[83:29.57]Manpang hides a vault, secret vault.
[83:31.81]The Throben Doors.
[83:32.97]The central tower of the Archmage is guarded by the fearsome Throben Doors.
[83:37.05]Archmage cannot see the doors.
[83:39.42]The Scratched Message.
[83:42.82]Third spell.
[83:43.44]The third spell of the Throben Doors is Invisibility.
[83:47.86]Okay.
[83:50.31]Minimites prevent magic, yes.
[83:53.45]I don't have any silver weapons.
[83:55.56]Snaticats are invisible.
[83:57.18]I wish that was still listed here.
[84:02.98]Thank you, D. Rick Game.
[84:04.84]Thanks for subbing.
[84:06.30]Zombieman4, thanks for eight months.
[84:08.92]Mr. Clegg.
[84:11.08]Thank you for the sub.
[84:13.64]A little hand to you.
[84:15.20]Thanks for two months.
[84:16.48]And then RipDarkSouls2.
[84:18.60]Thank you also for two months.
[84:21.36]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[84:24.89]Let's continue.
[84:26.65]Alright.
[84:31.39]Fortune teller.
[84:35.07]You join a long line of creatures outside the low stone building of the fortune teller.
[84:38.41]They are waiting with surprising patience.
[84:43.45]The creature in front of you is a hobgoblin with long blonde hair and two protruding hooked teeth.
[84:50.61]What is inside this building?
[84:53.14]You don't know?
[84:54.50]Why are you waiting here if you don't know?
[84:58.16]I saw the line.
[85:00.24]So you just joined.
[85:01.48]Well, I suppose when I first joined the line, it was for the same reason.
[85:06.20]But it seems so long ago now.
[85:07.78]How long have you been waiting?
[85:12.71]This time?
[85:13.53]A few hours, maybe.
[85:14.47]What do you mean, this time?
[85:18.71]Well, this isn't my first visit.
[85:20.59]No one visits wide only once.
[85:24.86]Did you say wide?
[85:26.50]That's right.
[85:27.16]Fair and wide.
[85:28.08]The great seer of Lower Mampang.
[85:30.54]Yeah, look at how gross my teeth are.
[85:32.94]See?
[85:33.88]You have heard of him.
[85:35.34]She pauses to scratch her chin.
[85:37.50]If you don't mind, I'd like to get back to waiting.
[85:42.96]Wait.
[85:44.08]You wait.
[85:45.16]A thin creature emerges from the building with a curious half-smile on his face.
[85:49.32]The next creature, a dwarf, enters.
[85:55.09]Wait.
[85:55.91]You continue waiting, nothing happens.
[86:02.81]You continue to wait, and the dwarf emerges.
[86:05.05]She too has a curious half-smile on her face.
[86:07.35]A black elf goes inside next.
[86:14.77]Wait.
[86:15.81]You keep waiting.
[86:17.33]Wait.
[86:18.19]You wait a little longer.
[86:19.79]Wait.
[86:20.57]The black elf emerges looking furious about something.
[86:23.23]A wood golem enters the building.
[86:28.99]Let's just push to the front of the line.
[86:31.53]You slip out of the line again, which closes up behind you immediately, and you walk towards the door of the building.
[86:37.00]A goblin stops you.
[86:39.18]What do you think you're doing?
[86:43.56]Get out of my way.
[86:44.22]I heard the teller's name is Wide.
[86:46.38]Can you believe it?
[86:50.40]I heard the teller's name is Wide.
[86:52.75]That's right, so what?
[86:56.63]I want to see if it's worth waiting for.
[86:59.12]Oh, it's worth it.
[87:00.48]This is my 13th time.
[87:05.65]Get in the fucking... You push the creature aside and barge your way into the building.
[87:10.51]To your surprise, those waiting in line give no response.
[87:17.45]What the fuck is this guy?
[87:19.05]You step inside the low building just as the wood golem leaves.
[87:23.11]Inside the room appears to be empty.
[87:25.28]Then a moment later you notice a squat, ugly figure behind the door clutching a pot.
[87:31.08]The creature meets your eyes and stares with fear.
[87:33.72]It's clear he was about to try to strike you on the head.
[87:39.85]Grab the pot.
[87:40.79]You grab for the pot and toss it away into a corner.
[87:44.70]Sorry about that.
[87:46.60]I saw you coming, you see.
[87:48.04]I knew you'd be trouble.
[87:53.82]You are fair and wide.
[87:56.18]I am.
[87:57.32]The greatest fortune teller in Lower Mampang.
[88:00.28]The only one, really.
[88:02.28]The others were all, well, unpopular.
[88:07.22]And you are very popular.
[88:10.94]Yeah, and you're very popular, aren't you?
[88:14.52]And loyal.
[88:15.32]I could tell my little ruse wouldn't work with you, so I didn't bother.
[88:21.34]People who come looking for fortunes never really want to hear them, you see.
[88:25.61]They always want to just be... They always want to be just about to hear them.
[88:30.95]So that's what I do.
[88:33.95]So he pretends to tell people fortunes?
[88:39.33]So you're a con artist?
[88:40.99]Oh, no, no, no.
[88:41.98]I really can see their futures, all of them.
[88:44.34]But why tell them?
[88:45.58]Who wants to know they're going to die of stomach blight?
[88:48.50]Or that their husband's going to leave them for a rock goblin?
[88:51.77]What good does it do?
[88:55.61]What's my fortune?
[88:58.05]Won't say.
[88:59.19]Can't make me say.
[89:03.62]You ball your fingers into a fist and wide cowers.
[89:07.04]Told you you'd make trouble.
[89:08.18]I'm never wrong, see?
[89:11.85]Tell me my future.
[89:13.85]Farron is clearly terrified, but still shakes his head.
[89:16.79]Won't do it.
[89:17.91]Can't do it.
[89:23.29]You're an imposter.
[89:25.61]No.
[89:26.41]No, I'm not.
[89:27.29]I'm not.
[89:27.81]Answer a question for me.
[89:30.47]Is it possible to pass the throbbing doors?
[89:32.76]Oh, no.
[89:33.94]Oh, no.
[89:34.32]It's impossible.
[89:35.84]Oh, I can't.
[89:36.82]Please don't ask me anything.
[89:38.30]Everything you say makes it more and more obvious.
[89:42.41]Makes what obvious?
[89:44.43]Who you are.
[89:45.15]Oh, it's no good.
[89:47.63]It's no good.
[89:48.15]Too late already.
[89:49.43]Wide looks at the floor.
[89:51.29]Please go.
[89:52.28]I've got lots of people waiting.
[89:55.72]Outside, the line shuffles forward as you emerge.
[90:03.39]This is so cute and so sad.
[90:06.33]Should I get sorcery or get the books?
[90:07.66]Get sorcery.
[90:08.70]The books are very complicated.
[90:11.18]There's a lot to them.
[90:13.18]There's a lot to... You need actual dice, I think, to play the books.
[90:21.67]I think we're done with the market area here.
[90:28.53]You head away from the maze of stalls and shops.
[90:30.29]There's a sudden commotion amongst the crowd.
[90:31.97]People are shouting and pointing.
[90:33.77]Looking up, the skies have been darkened by widespread wings.
[90:36.95]Birdmen.
[90:39.34]Apparently some guy thinks this is pretty fucking funny.
[90:44.16]Let's watch.
[90:46.52]You watch motionless.
[90:48.26]Perhaps they've not yet seen you.
[90:50.08]The people of Mampang are terrified and scatter in all directions around you.
[90:54.44]The birdmen swoop down onto the ground in the now empty market.
[90:58.82]Then they begin to pound across the flagstones, but not towards you.
[91:02.82]Instead, they enter the hut of the fortune teller, far and wide.
[91:05.84]A moment later, everything is still.
[91:09.92]Oh no.
[91:11.70]Keep watching.
[91:13.68]You keep watching.
[91:14.44]What are they doing?
[91:15.52]Are they arresting him for talking to you?
[91:17.75]And will he sell you out?
[91:21.07]Keep watching.
[91:22.35]You stay low watching.
[91:23.93]Nothing happens.
[91:25.35]And then the thatched roof of the low building explodes outwards and the birdmen rise from inside.
[91:31.07]Farron Y dangles from their talons limp.
[91:34.73]The birdmen wheel about and disappear towards the inner tower.
[91:37.48]Which way now?
[91:41.72]Danny DeVito got scooped up.
[91:46.35]Far and wide.
[91:47.57]Far and wide.
[91:51.11]We're over here already.
[91:52.05]Might as well just go this way.
[91:55.76]I got him fucking killed.
[91:57.00]I wanted to know my fortune.
[92:06.79]An old beggar woman lounges against a well nearby, watching people come and go from the market.
[92:11.96]A wider road leads west into a rundown area of the city.
[92:15.58]The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[92:17.06]A lot of beggars in this game, huh?
[92:24.52]A beggar.
[92:27.78]You walk over to the well where an old woman, little more than a bundle of rags, sits.
[92:32.75]She does not look at you as you approach.
[92:38.12]Her face is obscured by a shapeless hood.
[92:40.62]She rarely acknowledges anyone, not even holding out her hand for alms.
[92:48.81]Look into the well.
[92:50.79]You peer down into the well.
[92:53.75]Jump if you like.
[92:55.95]There's no bottom to it.
[93:01.91]Greet her.
[93:02.33]Well met, you declare.
[93:03.27]Oh...
[93:23.76]Her voice then... Her voice when she speaks is raspy, barely above a whisper.
[93:34.58]Her eyes are smooth, glossy black.
[93:41.67]There you are, brother.
[93:44.09]Found you.
[93:45.89]Now, spare an old blind woman a coin.
[93:50.15]And have to buy a crust of bread, perhaps.
[93:57.40]She looks pretty evil.
[94:01.14]I got enough.
[94:05.02]Look at this lady.
[94:06.10]Alright, give her a coin.
[94:07.02]Fine.
[94:08.43]You toss a gold coin onto her lap, and she rocks back and forth, grinning.
[94:14.33]Oh, love.
[94:15.93]You have made Javine a happy woman.
[94:18.73]Bless you for helping me live out my last days.
[94:22.15]She pauses to test the coin between her teeth and nods.
[94:25.51]Now, love, anything else for an old blind woman?
[94:33.46]Who are you?
[94:35.02]Well, now, my love, most call me... But you could just call me Javine.
[94:43.08]It's my prettier name.
[94:44.24]What happened to your eyes?
[94:49.78]Well, you don't waste time with pleasantries, do you?
[94:53.16]But I'll tell you my tale.
[94:55.22]I was called on by the Archmage himself to examine one of his creatures.
[94:59.86]The Archmage makes creatures.
[95:01.72]You see, all mixes and kinds.
[95:03.96]This one was a mucusy, slimy sort of thing called a... A mucolyte.
[95:09.34]A mucolytic.
[95:11.04]A miserable thing born totally without fear.
[95:14.26]They are almost deaf and speak only in whispers and they... They go like that.
[95:21.06]Uh, what happened?
[95:23.30]It was a single stupid minute.
[95:25.87]I got too close.
[95:27.29]So close that it attacked.
[95:29.07]And that was that.
[95:30.49]I lost me eyes to it.
[95:36.71]But you survived.
[95:39.26]If you call this existence of mine survival, then yes.
[95:42.68]But I don't know why that's what it is.
[95:45.68]I'm about to cry.
[95:48.60]And now you're a beggar.
[95:50.51]I was a healer before, but now, yes, now I beg.
[95:53.91]I sit here every day with little to pass the time for the tormenting I receive from the Sight Masters.
[96:01.13]Sight Masters?
[96:02.31]Here in Mampang, surely she is mistaken.
[96:06.56]Why did you stop healing?
[96:09.12]I couldn't heal once my eyes went.
[96:11.68]No one has much use for a blind healer, do they?
[96:14.62]Or a blind anything, if you listen to the Sight Monsters from Anorland.
[96:22.11]Sightmasters in Mampang.
[96:24.53]Oh, indeed, my lovely, indeed.
[96:30.49]Those bug-eyed monsters delight in my suffering.
[96:34.12]One lacking sight is a source of much curiosity to them.
[96:38.12]Half of them want to kill me, and half of them are in love with me.
[96:42.54]And those halves aren't entirely separate halves.
[96:45.32]Goddess, forgive me my foul mouth.
[96:50.58]I can help you.
[96:53.55]You could.
[96:54.39]You could.
[96:55.91]Kill one.
[96:57.51]There are too many for me to be free of their cruelty, but a death or two would taste good in the mouth.
[97:08.06]Uh, what do I get in return?
[97:10.40]I will reward you.
[97:12.49]I still can heal, and I also hear many things, love, and some are secrets that you might want to know.
[97:19.64]She yawns with such vigor that she throws a cascade of spittle into your shoulder.
[97:24.21]What a lovely chat.
[97:27.45]I so rarely get to talk these days, love.
[97:30.49]Come back any time, she grins.
[97:33.87]Especially if you do know, you know, you do the thing we talked about.
[97:39.14]And she draws a line across her throat.
[97:47.35]I have killed a sightmaster.
[97:50.90]Just lie to her?
[97:51.52]Hey, I did it!
[97:53.50]Hey, I did it!
[97:56.25]No, if I... No, hold on.
[97:57.67]She was like a fortune teller or something.
[97:59.65]She was like a healer and like a sorceress.
[98:01.51]She's gonna know I'm lying.
[98:05.67]No.
[98:07.30]I'll see you later.
[98:09.30]Goodbye, you declare with a nod.
[98:10.64]You leave the woman huddled by the well.
[98:17.84]Didn't I?
[98:19.15]No, I didn't kill any side masters.
[98:23.40]In the lake?
[98:24.14]Those are sightmasters in the lake?
[98:25.38]I thought those were goblins.
[98:28.06]Plus, aren't sightmasters my people, kind of?
[98:33.04]Let's go back to the square.
[98:34.15]I'm going to take a quick little break.
[98:35.03]I've got to use the bathroom and grab another drink.
[98:36.69]I'll be right back.
[98:38.75]Don't go anywhere.
[98:40.31]Don't go anywhere.
[100:54.16]I'm back.
[100:57.07]So.
[101:01.13]Let's just take a look.
[101:05.39]Going up and through here.
[101:06.97]There.
[101:11.05]I wish I could still have the markers from where I was.
[101:13.05]Because then I could see where I've been.
[101:18.76]Let's go down the road.
[101:22.28]He didn't wash his hands.
[101:23.07]No, I didn't wash my hands.
[101:24.69]I took a piss, I didn't wash my hands, and then I made food.
[101:27.31]Yeah, I made like chicken salad with my hands.
[101:36.27]I took like a big long piss and then made fucking tuna salad with my bare hands.
[101:43.86]And then fucking fed it to my enemies.
[101:50.10]I didn't do it.
[101:50.96]I washed my hands.
[101:51.68]I always wash my hands.
[101:52.76]I'm a clean freak when it comes to that type of hygienic shit.
[101:55.56]Okay?
[102:06.11]Alright.
[102:08.65]You walk west out of the square following a wide road that passes by a large gate.
[102:13.48]Before you is a stone facade that stretches the length of the street.
[102:16.72]Two men in heavy robes sit on the steps.
[102:23.54]Hey, Jeremy, did you know that Snaticats are invisible?
[102:25.46]I did not know that until right now, Gardner.
[102:28.07]Thank you for two months.
[102:31.53]But they are.
[102:33.01]And then the real Mr. Zombie, thank you for the 300 bits.
[102:35.13]Jeremy, you're a comedy gem.
[102:37.75]Only you can make me laugh hard enough to almost throw up.
[102:41.99]Well, I'm... I guess I'm glad and worried that I have that effect on you, dude.
[102:47.28]But thank you.
[102:47.96]Appreciate it.
[102:51.94]And that's it, I think.
[102:53.26]Thank you for the bits.
[102:53.90]People have been dropping the bits.
[102:57.54]Alright, look at the building.
[102:59.29]Arched windows are placed evenly.
[103:01.37]Though several panes are missing, worn steps lead to a door that is rather small for such a large building.
[103:06.71]The iron-studded doors are thrown open, and you glimpse a courtyard within.
[103:12.88]Greet the men.
[103:14.32]You greet the two men, and one of them grins.
[103:17.20]Greetings, brother.
[103:18.68]Feel free to enter, but you'll have to excuse us.
[103:21.55]My companion and I are a little busy betting on the patterns of the crowd.
[103:27.46]Okay, go inside.
[103:29.18]You nod and make your way through the gate.
[103:36.88]You step into the yard of the monastery.
[103:39.64]It is much quieter here and a sense of calm peace exudes from the building as though protected from the evil of the citadel around.
[103:47.44]A short flight of steps leads further inside to a wide, busy hall.
[103:51.60]Nearby, a monk watches you with gentle interest.
[103:56.26]Talk to the monk.
[103:58.44]Greetings.
[103:59.70]You must be an Oviatt.
[104:03.99]I have been for many years.
[104:05.05]That is correct.
[104:09.33]Yeah, that's correct.
[104:11.69]Welcome to the Fold, then.
[104:13.45]How are you settling in?
[104:14.37]Eh, it's... It's a difficult life.
[104:20.55]That's a shame you find it so.
[104:22.69]Is there anything in particular?
[104:25.71]Food is terrible.
[104:26.61]I've lost my faith.
[104:31.71]Shit.
[104:34.61]I killed the Sightmaster?
[104:35.73]Well, alright.
[104:42.75]I've lost my faith.
[104:45.10]That was quick.
[104:46.90]You're free to leave the monastery, of course.
[104:48.92]Several do.
[104:50.12]Though Effie still may watch over you until you pledge yourself to another spirit.
[104:57.90]Oh, is this like a new god?
[104:59.38]Tell me.
[105:00.90]Well, long ago, when the world was intact, there was a group of monks who took a vow of silence.
[105:06.68]They could only speak once a year.
[105:09.03]This is a guy, not a girl.
[105:11.85]Do you need assistance, Naviat?
[105:17.81]Where can I get a... Can monks go anywhere in the city?
[105:22.07]For the most part, yes.
[105:23.57]Of course, our chores and worship keep us to the monastery mostly.
[105:27.85]But if we are sent on an errand, the guards do not bother us.
[105:32.42]even in the restricted parts of the city hmm oh yes it really is not a bother I suppose the guards think us harmless you move away disguise intact I have the robes on cries and cheers come from inside the monastery building I have these like fucking drapes on okay inside the monastery
[105:59.14]You climb the steps into the monastery building.
[106:00.96]This place seems rather busy for a monastery.
[106:03.86]Monks and citizens crowd around long tables, and a commotion is coming from a crowd to one side.
[106:09.51]Wide doors lead deeper into the monastery itself.
[106:12.75]Small iron-lined windows dot the walls, allowing a little light.
[106:19.97]What can I do?
[106:26.32]Uh... Sense danger!
[106:32.46]Looking to the stars, you craft a magic and a steady voice begins to speak to you.
[106:36.12]But for once, the voice is reassuring.
[106:39.01]This place holds no unwelcome surprises.
[106:42.03]It's message delivered.
[106:42.97]The spell goes away.
[106:49.78]Look around.
[106:51.20]Most of Effie's monks are gambling or betting in one way or another.
[106:55.66]One stands on one leg while another counts seconds.
[106:58.80]Opposite two monks stand under a tree, guessing when a particular leaf will fall.
[107:03.61]A log of firewall, surrounded by many spectators, is an intricate race course for rats.
[107:10.27]Most people here are gambling.
[107:12.01]Several monks supervise the betting of various sorts, but most... I'm in a casino.
[107:16.02]You guys, somebody told... Who told me there was a casino in this game?
[107:19.10]Because we're in.
[107:22.32]Enjoy the next two hours of this stream because we're not leaving here.
[107:26.70]Let's... Okay.
[107:27.85]Yeah, the rattle of dice and the grumble of betting comes from a side chamber.
[107:31.47]Alright, the rat run, the dice chamber, rat run.
[107:39.01]You walk up to the rat course, elbowing your way through the crowd.
[107:43.09]Four rats are hurrying through an assortment of turns and obstacles, trying to reach a molding morsel of OWW fixed to a spike at the far end.
[107:51.60]A monk with scars on his face directs the proceedings.
[107:55.02]The scarred monk looks up at you.
[107:57.64]Here to bet?
[108:02.37]High-speed, high-octane rat racing gameplay, that's right.
[108:07.70]I have questions.
[108:09.20]Ask away.
[108:12.36]Are the rats magical?
[108:13.84]What?
[108:14.18]No!
[108:14.94]Why would we use magic rats?
[108:16.66]They just run, after all.
[108:18.74]What a horrible idea, anyway.
[108:20.10]A magical rat.
[108:26.08]What can I win?
[108:28.06]Uh, gold, of course.
[108:30.04]That's what betting is.
[108:31.36]Are you new to this?
[108:32.55]He peers at your habit curiously.
[108:35.87]Alright, place a bet.
[108:37.31]I wish to bet, you declare.
[108:39.81]This should be an interesting race.
[108:41.53]The monk handling the wages assures you.
[108:44.29]The stake will be 30 gold pieces.
[108:48.97]Fuck, I only have 17 gold.
[108:51.97]That's too much.
[108:53.45]The scarred monk shrugs and the race begins.
[108:55.07]You leave the rat course behind.
[108:56.85]Any 30 gold for that shit?
[109:05.44]It's night outside.
[109:06.44]30 gold.
[109:08.56]The dice chamber.
[109:12.15]You walk over a long room set with a wooden table on which several games of Swindlestones are being played.
[109:17.93]You find a monk who grins at you.
[109:20.03]Fancy a game, brother?
[109:21.35]We stake 10 gold pieces in Ify's honor.
[109:25.86]My cheer didn't show up.
[109:27.04]I am ashamed.
[109:27.74]Alright, let's do it.
[109:30.94]10 gold.
[109:32.18]It's time to play in the casino.
[109:36.31]The monk counts out three dice each and takes the first bid.
[109:39.01]Three dice each?
[109:42.33]Bye, Effie.
[109:44.25]I've never seen you before, brother.
[109:46.25]You are new here?
[109:47.01]Alright.
[109:50.19]Three dice each.
[109:51.82]So I have two ones.
[109:53.10]I could say there's two ones right off the bat.
[109:59.70]Or I could, you know, let's just say...
[110:05.85]Should I say three ones?
[110:07.59]Because you might know that's a mistake.
[110:09.23]I'm going to go two fours.
[110:14.66]Threes.
[110:15.98]Two threes.
[110:18.88]Don't you dare call.
[110:20.14]Three threes.
[110:23.56]Oh, really?
[110:25.52]Don't fucking think so, buddy.
[110:27.24]Call.
[110:27.66]You have to have three.
[110:36.97]The game is mine.
[110:38.30]He has two dice.
[110:38.90]I can count.
[110:43.02]Go to the fish and chips machine room.
[110:45.48]Alright, two twos.
[110:48.24]It's always good when you start with two.
[110:53.87]We're going to go right to it.
[110:56.85]Two threes.
[111:03.32]Alright, no.
[111:04.24]God, wait a minute.
[111:05.02]This might be bad.
[111:06.36]He might have two threes.
[111:08.54]In which case, I lose the game.
[111:12.13]He has to have two threes, right?
[111:17.51]Fuck, I'm going to have to call it.
[111:18.57]The probabilities of him having two threes is pretty low.
[111:21.99]Yep, I win.
[111:23.75]Get fucking swindled this round.
[111:29.20]Call him.
[111:29.86]Call him.
[111:30.46]Call.
[111:30.98]Call.
[111:32.99]I have noticed the guards seem most agitated, brother.
[111:35.31]Alright.
[111:37.75]One, one.
[111:41.29]Two ones.
[111:42.75]He has a one.
[111:44.91]I have a one, two.
[111:45.51]Two ones.
[111:47.13]Don't you dare.
[111:48.21]Three ones.
[111:48.81]That's impossible.
[111:49.91]Ladies and gentlemen, that's a flawless victory.
[111:52.59]I win the game.
[111:55.18]This guy just got swindled.
[111:56.28]27 gold.
[112:00.81]The monk nods with great pleasure and hands over ten gold pieces as you take back your stake.
[112:04.89]A fine match.
[112:06.10]Another?
[112:09.04]Let's increase the stake a little.
[112:12.14]The monk nods.
[112:12.68]How much?
[112:15.34]Ten.
[112:15.88]Ten gold pieces.
[112:17.82]This is a twenty gold piece game.
[112:19.72]Come on.
[112:20.83]Come on.
[112:21.17]Let's do some swindle swinding.
[112:26.23]One, one.
[112:29.74]Alright, I got two threes.
[112:33.41]Let's go with two ones.
[112:35.29]Yeah, I have a one.
[112:36.23]Dickhead.
[112:39.70]Three ones.
[112:41.10]Nope.
[112:41.80]There's almost no way that you have three ones.
[112:44.86]That's pretty impossible.
[112:47.22]Wow, that was close.
[112:47.94]He had two ones.
[112:56.15]It's rigged.
[112:58.23]Oh, boy.
[112:58.79]This is a guaranteed winning round.
[112:59.97]I gotta play it right, though.
[113:04.18]That's a straight up three twos.
[113:09.02]We're gonna just fuck with them right now.
[113:10.43]Two ones.
[113:13.15]Two ones.
[113:16.27]Oh, I have two fours.
[113:17.61]That's not good.
[113:18.45]Here we go.
[113:18.89]No, I can still... Yeah, guess what?
[113:21.03]Oh, two fours.
[113:22.93]Three twos.
[113:25.01]He's going to call this and he's going to lose.
[113:29.23]I knew it.
[113:29.55]Yep.
[113:29.85]Sorry, buddy.
[113:31.31]I did have three twos.
[113:34.55]Game is yours.
[113:38.82]Do it again.
[113:40.52]The probability of me winning is pretty damn high.
[113:45.03]One five.
[113:46.53]One four.
[113:49.23]Oh, okay.
[113:52.07]Two fours.
[113:55.31]Sure.
[113:55.87]He's going to say three fours.
[113:58.27]And you lost.
[113:59.44]I just made a bunch of money.
[114:01.36]Call it.
[114:02.26]I'll take the victory.
[114:04.48]The game is mine.
[114:07.04]Get swindled.
[114:07.76]47 gold.
[114:10.89]The monk smiles benevolently and gives you 20 gold pieces as you collect your winnings.
[114:15.21]An exciting round, again?
[114:16.71]No, I want to go to the rat race.
[114:23.09]47 gold, it's 30 gold for the rat race.
[114:25.77]Rats, decline.
[114:27.87]The monk nods.
[114:28.94]True luck does not always favor play.
[114:31.18]He agrees.
[114:32.26]You get up from the long table, the monk bidding you goodbye, and return to the courtyard.
[114:35.94]Time for rat race.
[114:41.69]Uh, make a move.
[114:43.67]Seems the gambling at the monastery goes on well into the night.
[114:46.25]Yeah, like every other casino.
[114:47.37]They're all 24 hours.
[114:49.53]24-hour casino in Sw- This is awesome.
[114:53.36]Alright.
[114:54.44]You head back to the rat course.
[114:55.40]The track is illuminated by a line of torches allowing the gambling to go long into the night.
[114:59.92]The scarred monk greets you.
[115:00.90]A bet, I hope.
[115:02.52]Place a bet.
[115:04.24]I wish to bet.
[115:06.08]This will be an odd round, the monk handling the wagers assures you.
[115:10.09]It's 30 gold pieces, what do you say?
[115:15.55]Place a stake.
[115:16.85]You place your coin on a promising-looking rat.
[115:19.99]The four rats shoot off, climbing a steep hill made of wood and paper.
[115:24.30]Your pick stumbles near the top.
[115:27.26]The rats then jostle through a narrow tunnel, and your favorite nearly gains the lead.
[115:32.79]The rat rounds a sharp corner and then rush towards the finish line.
[115:36.56]Yours looks confident as it nears the end, though it is hard to tell with a rat.
[115:41.58]The race finishes and your rat loses.
[115:43.72]It placed second just behind the winner.
[115:45.83]It had raced bravely.
[115:47.25]The scarred monk pockets your money with glee.
[115:49.21]The rats are scooped up and watered and then placed back at the start.
[115:52.39]They seem eager to do so.
[115:53.53]What the fuck?
[116:03.30]Hold on.
[116:07.08]Eat something.
[116:11.18]Go back over here.

[123:41.68]should be an exciting race alright play a stake alright you bet your money on a hungry seeming contender the four rats begin climbing a steep hill made of wooden paper your favorite takes the lead near the top the rats then scurry through a narrow tunnel and your rat nearly gets stuck in the tunnel the rats take the tight corner and then race towards the final flag yours appears worried as it approaches the finish line
[124:07.06]The race finishes and your rat loses.
[124:08.64]It placed third, well behind the winner.
[124:11.44]It had been distracted by the roaring crowd.
[124:19.11]Do it again.
[124:20.99]Before rats start running, climbing up the steep hill, your rat quickly vomits near the top.
[124:28.33]The rats then bustle through a narrow tunnel and your pick nearly loses an eye.
[124:33.72]The rats run the tight corner and then power towards the finish line.
[124:36.68]Yours is distracted as it closes the end of the course.
[124:40.22]Your rat comes in.
[124:41.70]It scurries across the finish line.
[124:50.00]I win.
[124:50.92]The monk's groan as the race ends.
[125:02.46]I did it.

[127:08.24]Alright.
[127:10.28]Is there any other games to play in here?
[127:14.64]A hall.
[127:16.93]You walk deeper into the cool of the monastery.
[127:19.49]It's much quieter in here.
[127:21.11]Your footsteps echo on the cool stone floor as you emerge into a wide hall.
[127:25.85]Pews line one side and an altar is in the corner.
[127:31.75]Move on.
[127:32.72]You could explore the monastery further or return to the streets.
[127:37.32]The Altar.
[127:40.44]You move closer to the altar in the pew as some kind of service is going on.
[127:44.54]Monks are clustered in groups chanting in a slurring monotone.
[127:48.07]A monk in bright red robes, the abbot, stands with arms outstretched.
[127:54.03]Watch the service.
[127:57.15]You stand and watch the service.
[127:58.86]The chanting is odd, a droning buzz lacking discernible phrases.
[128:02.90]You catch snatches of what might be words,
[128:06.20]but they sound like a strange imitation of a language.
[128:08.68]Some monks are jovial, whispering to each other and jostling, but others are solemn.
[128:15.79]Cast a spell.
[128:23.81]Zip cause teleportation.
[128:25.29]They just ruin their sermon.
[128:30.53]Pot?
[128:32.13]Throw a fireball?
[128:34.51]I don't like this service.
[128:36.21]I'm gonna take a bunch of money from your casino and then burn it down.
[128:41.57]Rap?
[128:41.89]Talk all languages.
[128:47.78]Uh, six?
[128:48.86]Clone the caster?
[128:49.92]Why would I want to do that?
[128:54.66]Uh, nap?
[128:55.94]Cause sleepiness?
[129:00.48]Those age-old vomit strats.
[129:04.62]I'm not sure what to do here.
[129:11.36]Make them dance?
[129:12.06]I don't have jig right now.
[129:13.04]I have God, Illusion of Worship.
[129:17.24]I just go up there and stand up there.
[129:18.36]Hey, believe in me!
[129:23.54]Yeah, there's no jig.
[129:24.76]I would do it right now.
[129:29.03]Hot.
[129:29.53]Oh, man.
[129:32.31]This deserves a pull.
[129:33.51]A pull for what?
[129:35.03]If I'm going to throw a fireball into the... I know you guys are going to make me burn the casino down.
[129:38.71]How am I going to come back in here and do my rat races?
[129:45.68]I could do rat... Yeah, I could understand them.
[129:47.08]Yeah, we'll do rat.
[129:48.44]Talk all languages.
[129:49.26]Cast.
[129:52.32]Pulling out the green wig, you put it on and cast the spell.
[129:56.20]Under the influence of the spell, the words from the choir's chant translate themselves.
[130:00.69]They are meaningless murmurs, nonsense words, repeated over and over.
[130:05.17]Left and right, sing the choir.
[130:07.11]Up and down.
[130:07.91]Back and forth.
[130:09.09]Dead and alive.
[130:10.31]Lucky and unlucky.
[130:12.05]And so forth, over and over.
[130:14.08]You take off the wig, having learned nothing.
[130:16.94]The abbot, his bright habit distinguishing him, stands placidly in front of the room.
[130:21.62]The altar near him is covered in bronze, its top battered and pitted.
[130:25.82]Atop is a small bowl and a set of metal dice.
[130:28.99]The chanting peters out and the abbot smiles.
[130:33.47]Wait.
[130:35.10]Brothers and sisters, we give thanks to Effie.
[130:39.44]We meditate on the changes and chances that fill our lives.
[130:43.50]We give ourselves over to the dice roll, to the risk, and let her nudge as she sees fit.
[130:50.55]He gestures to a monk who approaches the altar.
[130:53.31]Sister, it is your day to roll.
[130:59.71]Wait.
[131:01.83]A monk approaches, grasps the dice, and then tosses them across the altar with a clang.
[131:06.70]The abbot considers the dice and tuts.
[131:09.92]No luck for you.
[131:11.64]Half rations for a day.
[131:13.70]Think upon this chance.
[131:17.80]It keeps wanting me to go to bed.
[131:20.58]Wait, there is a long stretch of chanting and then the service comes to an end.
[131:25.82]The monks file out towards the gardens or linger by the altar.
[131:28.65]The echoes die away.
[131:30.63]The monks stand and file away.
[131:33.87]Cloister.
[131:36.29]You step back to the doors once more.
[131:38.65]All is quiet in the chamber.
[131:41.99]Let's rest.
[131:44.16]You take a moment to rest on the stone benches.
[131:45.84]It is a peaceful spot, perhaps the most peaceful in all of Mampang.
[131:49.38]All is quiet in the chamber.
[131:51.00]Monks move softly around the darkened rooms.
[131:55.75]The dormitory.
[131:59.59]You head down a short flight of steps into the dormitories, nodding at bypassing brethren.
[132:04.79]You find a row of plain cots and a table cluttered with different games of chance.
[132:09.54]The cots are filled with sleeping bodies.
[132:12.23]Give me one second while I blow my fucking dirty, gross-ass nose.
[132:25.46]Okay.
[132:27.18]Uh, sleep.
[132:29.18]Trusting that your habit will keep you out of trouble, you stretch out on a berth.
[132:32.70]Removing your pack, you try to settle despite the hard floor.
[132:35.50]At least you've eaten once already today.
[132:37.58]So do not need to eat again to avoid hunger.
[132:42.44]Close my eyes.
[132:43.90]You lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[132:45.70]You feel quite safe here, and you do not dream.
[132:51.28]Thank you, Can, or Concerto.
[132:53.30]Concerto, thank you for your sub.
[132:58.00]You changed to using the Cutlass, plus six, ate one provision and gained a huge amount of gold.
[133:04.23]Entered the monastery of Effie the Fortuitous and spoke to Shadrick Stone.
[133:09.45]The Archmage is aware of you.
[133:12.07]And you blew your nose, and you feel better for it.
[133:16.61]You wake refreshed, then sit bolt upright as you find six monks sitting around the bed, watching you intently.
[133:24.20]As your eyes open, one punches the air, and the others shake their heads.
[133:29.46]They exchange a few coins, nod to you, and then move away.
[133:32.89]You climb back up the stairs to the quiet chamber.
[133:35.75]Wait, were they betting on if I was going to wake up or not?
[133:44.49]You head back to the main chamber.
[133:46.41]Chanting fills the space.
[133:49.35]Listen to the singing.
[133:51.41]You pause for a while to listen to the singing.
[133:52.81]It is a strange tune, restless, sometimes harmonious, but at other times horrifically atonal.
[133:58.80]It is as though all the singers are singing their own songs, letting them coincide or conflict as luck would have it.
[134:05.88]The effect is rather unsettling and not especially pleasant, like me needing to blow my nose again.
[134:10.47]I'll be right back.
[134:27.93]God.
[134:29.05]Monks move this way and that about their business.
[134:30.71]I think I'm done here, huh?
[134:37.49]The courtyard.
[134:39.79]You step back into the main courtyard.
[134:44.66]What can I even do here?
[134:45.68]That's a spell.
[134:46.46]I mean, there's sense danger, there's sap, cause depression.
[134:53.94]Should I make all these gambling addicts depressed?
[134:56.38]That doesn't sound like a good idea.
[135:03.42]What do I do on my way out?
[135:06.51]How safe passage.
[135:11.93]Yap.
[135:13.07]Oh, the rats, the rats, the rats, the rats.
[135:17.43]I need to, okay, let's talk to the rats.
[135:23.87]Rats, rats, rats.
[135:25.89]Yap.
[135:26.99]Talk with animals.
[135:29.52]Taking the wig from your pack, you wear it and form your spell.
[135:32.58]There are no animals around you to talk to, but from the rat race course you can hear a tiny voice.
[135:36.99]I win again!
[135:40.03]The cheese is mine, you pumpkins!
[135:45.96]Aw, that was dumb.
[135:48.14]Make a move.
[135:54.73]The cheese is behind you.
[135:55.87]I fucking love rats.
[135:57.54]Who doesn't like rats?
[135:58.82]Rats get a really bad rap, by the way.
[136:01.80]This guy's laughing in my face.
[136:08.86]This guy's gonna laugh again and it's gonna interrupt me.
[136:12.00]Shut up.
[136:15.86]Whoa.
[136:17.66]Whoa.
[136:20.46]Let's get out of here.
[136:23.02]You make your way down the steps and out of the monastery.
[136:26.51]Yeah, everybody, like, hates rats.
[136:30.84]Like, rats and mice get a really bad rap.
[136:33.98]They're mammals.
[136:35.22]That's why people hate them so much.
[136:37.10]I get it.
[136:38.24]They, like, hide in your walls, and they shit in your bed, and they eat through your fucking PlayStation cords and stuff, but, like, the actual animal rats and mice, they're fucking cool.
[136:48.20]Like, rats are wicked cute and funny, and they have, like, their little faces, and they're, like, big and fat and ugly and stupid and bad and a shitty dumb animal.
[136:54.23]I love them.
[136:57.17]And they stink.
[136:57.75]They fucking have this terrible stench.
[137:03.93]Let's contradict ourselves.
[137:08.01]No, I love rats.
[137:13.15]Real talk, seriously.
[137:17.06]I think rats... I like rats better than cats.
[137:19.38]You know what I mean?
[137:21.34]Like, I'd rather have, like, a rat than, like, a cat.
[137:28.61]I probably just made a ton of people angry.
[137:33.39]You step out of the calm oasis of the monastery and back into the dust and gray of Mampang.
[137:37.50]The road stretches a short way in both directions.
[137:43.50]You know, I think... Hold on a second.
[137:44.54]Is my birthday the rat?
[137:47.04]Am I a rat?
[137:48.08]I need to know.
[137:48.74]Hold on.
[137:49.06]Alright, what months are the rat?
[137:56.68]In, uh, like, astrology.
[137:58.33]In the Chinese zodiac.
[138:00.85]Chinese zodiac rat.
[138:02.59]What is it?
[138:06.62]I hope it's me.
[138:10.85]Oh, no!
[138:11.65]By one year!
[138:15.25]The years of the... A rat year occurs every 12 years.
[138:17.97]Rat years are 1912, 1924, 36, 48, 60, 72, 80, 1984, 96, 2008, and 2020.
[138:18.83]Fuck.
[138:19.03]Damn it.
[138:19.21]By one year.
[138:36.14]What is... Alright, what is 85?
[138:41.48]What boring fucking animal am I?
[138:43.96]I'm the ox.
[138:45.10]Oh, great.
[138:47.62]1985.
[138:47.68]Can't wait to be a fucking ox.
[138:51.19]By the way, ox... Ox has too good of a rap.
[138:54.61]Can we be very clear here?
[138:56.11]Rats have a really bad rap.
[138:57.85]Oxes have a way too cool rap.
[139:00.83]Oxes aren't cool.
[139:02.97]They're big pig donkeys.
[139:09.77]Everybody loves oxes.
[139:10.79]Oh!
[139:11.19]Oh, by the way, the American bison is the official animal of America.
[139:16.30]It should be a fucking rat.
[139:26.08]You should not have cast your invisible.
[139:28.24]Let's go.
[139:31.84]Don't worry, Jerma.
[139:32.52]Nobody here thinks you're cool.
[139:34.95]Ah, well, you just got permanently banned.
[139:37.09]So.
[139:37.93]I'm gonna be- No, I'll do it myself.
[139:40.40]Don't worry, I'll do it myself.
[139:41.18]I'll permanently ban him myself.
[139:44.10]Don't worry, the mods don't even have to take care of it.
[139:46.04]I already did it.
[139:49.59]Just right-click.
[139:51.17]Ban.
[139:52.39]Permanently.
[139:54.45]See ya later.
[139:59.97]Forever.
[140:00.83]Permanently.
[140:08.34]I love how every opinion I have is, this is the best ever, but this sucks.
[140:15.27]Fucking get banned!
[140:16.83]Ban that guy, too!
[140:22.03]Alright.
[140:24.29]The road curves along the edge of a tall stone wall, eventually reaching a low metal door.
[140:28.64]The air moves a little around you, still icy, but fresh.
[140:32.40]Nobody... I can't do it.
[140:34.42]There's a lot of people to ban in this chat.
[140:36.44]Because at least... Jeremy, you're old?
[140:39.21]You're old?
[140:39.73]Well... Fuck you.
[140:43.25]What do you say about that?
[140:51.49]Everything you guys have said has just been deleted.
[140:54.39]Calling me old and shit.
[140:56.22]How dare you.
[140:58.54]How fucking dare you.
[141:06.23]but always made of thin strips of metal riveted together with a few gaps and holes between the plates.
[141:12.34]Peering through the holes, you can make out a sea of waving grass stalks tall.
[141:15.46]I have to blow my nose again.
[141:16.94]I'm going to ban my fucking nose in one minute.
[142:10.96]go.
[142:13.70]Alright.
[142:15.96]Let's go inside this building.
[142:17.82]Or inside this... What is over here anyways?
[142:20.88]Big open field.
[142:24.66]The fields.
[142:26.93]Sure, why not?
[142:30.55]Mystery stream.
[142:33.79]You slip under the archway into a wide field of wheatgrass.
[142:36.59]Each stalk is taller than you stand.
[142:38.45]The heavy door slams shut behind you.
[142:42.69]Oh, let's move on.
[142:43.25]That slammed shut behind me.
[142:45.13]Alright, you move away from the door into the grasslands.
[142:51.89]Wading through the long wheat like this will be hard work.
[142:54.45]A few clouds move across the heavens.
[142:58.75]Well, shit.
[143:01.39]Well, it's either this way or that way.
[143:02.79]Why would you go this way?
[143:06.23]Let's head towards the dome.
[143:09.71]Jerma is a mistake.
[143:12.76]You walk on through the long grass, then something large slithers over your foot.
[143:17.30]Hopping back, you see a large snake disappear into the wheat.
[143:22.84]Attack.
[143:24.47]You slash at the snake, but only manage to scythe a few stalks.
[143:28.47]You lose sight of the beast as it slithers away.
[143:30.25]I want to test my new weapon, really.
[143:36.87]Wolfie B, thanks for two months, too.
[143:37.93]Welcome back.
[143:40.69]The spire.
[143:43.93]Yeah, there is always snakes in the grass.
[143:46.72]Thank you, Zito.
[143:47.30]Welcome.
[143:48.90]You stride onward through the field of wheat.
[143:50.72]The spire stands in front of you as high as an ancient tree, but impossibly thin.
[143:55.29]How can it stay upright?
[143:57.53]At the base is an opening just large enough to enter.
[143:59.53]Let's look at it.
[144:03.51]The spire is built from tiny stacked stones into a low pointed tower.
[144:07.94]It is clearly old and somewhat poorly maintained.
[144:11.28]There's a low door at its base, though it hardly seems large enough for a person to enter.
[144:15.50]You could venture inside the dim space within the narrow spire.
[144:18.11]As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[144:21.37]Sure.
[144:26.37]Weak light filters in from above, but the ceiling is shrouded from view.
[144:30.57]There is no floor, but the grass underfoot is pale and short.
[144:34.01]At the center of the room is a small shrine, a cut stump of wood on which stands a tiny clay idol.
[144:43.08]Let's take a look around here.
[144:45.08]You investigate around the shrine, but find nothing except a rotten ladder bolted to one wall, most of its rungs missing.
[144:55.86]Uh, let's go up.
[144:57.78]You attempt to scale the ladder, but there are too few handholds and the ladder is far too old to be of any use.
[145:03.34]Even if there was anything worth climbing up to.
[145:09.40]What did I just get?
[145:10.34]Who's clipped?
[145:10.74]What happened?
[145:11.34]I just got clipped?
[145:13.94]What is this?
[145:14.42]I want to watch this.
[145:16.50]Declare.
[145:23.04]Oh, that's what it was.
[145:23.84]Okay.
[145:29.24]That was fucking gross.
[145:31.27]Uh, let's go to the shrine.
[145:32.13]Uh, you approach the shrine, a hefty tree stump has been carried here and carefully cut and sanded.
[145:38.95]The idol on top is unpainted clay.
[145:43.24]Pray at the shrine...
[145:51.67]let's look at the idol the idol is small enough that you need to squat to see it it is roughly made with pits and defects it is human shaped clutching a sword that points towards the ground it lacks a face and is unnaturally cold to the touch as though it drank your warmth oh boy pray at the shrine leave the shrine or destroy the idol
[146:23.77]Clip him watching the clip.
[146:27.82]Hold on a second.
[146:28.96]Hold on.
[146:29.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[146:30.38]Wait a minute.
[146:34.20]Alright, somebody has to... Somebody clip this.
[146:37.48]Declare.
[146:39.00]Oh, what the fuck was that?
[146:41.92]That was disgusting.
[146:43.71]I can't believe I did that.
[146:45.79]What a fucking weirdo.
[146:47.93]Clip that.
[146:48.89]Clip it.
[147:02.22]I'm going to do a straw poll, but this is important.
[147:13.08]Good acting.
[147:19.45]Somebody link the clip.
[147:26.09]Acting stream.
[147:29.19]Nobody did it.
[147:31.78]Nobody fucking did it.
[147:33.69]Oh, there it is.
[147:35.99]Okay.
[147:36.47]What is this clip of?
[147:37.33]Hold on.
[147:37.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[147:38.77]Wait a minute.
[147:39.33]Holy shit.
[147:40.41]Wait, wait, what?
[147:41.31]Alright.
[147:42.77]Somebody clip this.
[147:44.09]What are we talking about?
[147:45.11]Clip this.
[147:45.85]Declare.
[147:47.80]Huh?
[147:49.46]What the fuck?
[147:50.14]That was disgusting.
[147:51.76]I can't believe I did that.
[147:53.22]Oh, shut up.
[147:53.44]Shut up, you.
[147:54.10]What a fucking weirdo.
[147:55.90]Clip it.
[147:56.24]Quick.
[148:19.03]Be tooth marks in the walls.
[148:21.51]That's not even the right clip.
[148:24.30]Wait, wait, what?
[148:25.36]Alright, somebody has to, somebody clip this.
[148:27.62]What are we talking about clip this?
[148:28.96]We're talking about you getting clipped.
[148:31.10]Huh?
[148:31.64]Me burping it.
[148:32.76]What the fuck is that?
[148:33.80]That's disgusting.
[148:35.06]Why do you believe I did that?
[148:36.74]Oh, shut up.
[148:37.26]This is fucking stupid.
[148:39.47]Clip it, quick.
[148:58.37]Somebody get... Chip.
[149:09.82]That's not even it.
[149:11.06]Where is it?
[149:11.90]You're giving me the wrong clips.
[149:14.86]You're not even giving me the right clips.
[149:17.30]We're talking about you getting clipped.
[149:19.98]Me burping.
[149:21.14]Somebody clip it.
[149:22.00]Clip it quick.
[149:22.92]Get it.
[149:23.52]Get it clipped.
[149:23.92]We're talking about you getting clipped.
[149:26.10]I'm going to smash a bottle over your fucking head, Jerma.
[149:38.80]Got it.
[149:39.22]Come on.
[149:41.21]Come on.
[149:42.67]Give me it.
[149:47.51]This is the wrong clip.
[149:49.81]This isn't the right fucking clip.
[149:52.83]Not the right one.
[149:55.56]That's not even the right clip.
[149:56.80]Where is it?
[149:57.48]You gave me the wrong clip.
[149:58.82]You gave me the right clip.
[150:03.04]We're talking about you getting clipped.
[150:05.03]That's not even it.
[150:06.33]Where is it?
[150:06.95]You gave me the wrong clip.
[150:08.15]You gave me the right clip.
[150:10.89]Clip it quick!

[150:18.08]Yeah, I'm gonna smash a bottle over your fucking head.
[150:20.94]I just... Jerma.
[150:21.98]Spilled everywhere.
[150:22.88]It's everywhere.
[150:23.44]I spilled my drink everywhere.
[150:24.72]Come on.
[150:26.18]I fucking spilled everywhere.
[150:27.82]That's not even the right clip.
[150:29.10]Where is it?
[150:29.79]Wrong clip.
[150:31.03]This is the wrong clip.
[150:32.31]Right clip.
[150:32.93]This isn't the right fucking clip.
[150:35.29]We're talking about you getting clipped.
[150:36.97]Not the right one.
[150:37.55]That's not even it.
[150:38.49]Where is it?
[150:39.55]I'm lost.
[150:40.01]I can't even get it.
[150:40.71]This isn't the right clip.
[150:42.29]How do I close it?
[150:43.07]Where is it?
[150:43.71]No, I've got to close it.
[150:44.85]Where is it?
[150:45.35]Where is it?
[151:03.72]Fuck
[151:31.37]No, one more clips.
[151:32.17]No more clips.
[151:32.57]I'm done.
[151:33.31]Hold on.
[151:33.57]I need a minute, man.
[151:35.07]I am in fucking pain.
[151:37.71]I've ruined my... I spit fucking a drink.
[151:39.97]My whole drink dumped all over my penis and all over my keyboard and shit.
[151:44.94]Oh, my God.
[151:47.96]Oh.
[151:49.22]So many fucking... No, what was getting me was like the other burps.
[151:54.48]Hold on.
[151:55.02]I gotta be right back.
[151:56.46]Oh, fucking somebody just gave me $100.
[151:57.92]Hold on a second.
[151:59.56]Give me a second.
[152:01.02]Get some tea.
[152:02.29]One second.
[152:41.40]I can't even move.
[152:42.30]Hold on.
[152:42.77]I'll be back.
[153:41.34]Yeah.
[154:18.04]Man, oh man.
[154:21.08]I need to clean my whole desk.
[154:23.14]There's shit everywhere.
[154:25.69]This is not good.
[154:26.35]I'm going to have to get a new keyboard.
[154:27.57]I'm not even kidding.
[154:29.67]A whole drink just dumped into the middle of the keyboard.
[154:35.49]Jesus.
[154:36.37]Fucking tap dancing.
[154:38.13]God.
[154:40.24]I did not expect that to be as funny as that was.
[154:44.34]It was just the burps.
[154:45.00]It was the fucking burps and the fact that people would just spit.
[154:47.17]People were putting the wrong clips in.
[154:49.45]People were putting the wrong clips in.
[154:51.73]That's so fucking funny.
[154:52.83]I was clicking them.
[154:53.73]So, like, there were other shit from, like, three weeks ago being played.
[155:00.70]God.
[155:06.14]If that kept going, I would have choked and died.
[155:07.75]Me too.
[155:10.01]Like, I would have died on stream.
[155:11.94]I would have choked on this drink and died.
[155:14.92]Well, that was fun.
[155:21.18]What was I talking about?
[155:24.98]Smash a bottle over somebody's head?
[155:28.51]You had surgery to have a metal bar put in my chest and you nearly made me burst it out of my rib cage.
[155:32.53]Oh, Jesus, dude.

[156:10.56]That was... I laughed.
[156:11.68]That was... Yeah.
[156:14.90]I mean, I've laughed at a lot of things over the last couple of months.
[156:18.90]But for some reason, that just seriously just dug into my body and wouldn't let go.
[156:26.04]Man.
[156:28.54]But yeah, thanks, guys.
[156:29.36]Thanks also to the resubs here.

[156:51.53]Thank you, real zombie Jesus.
[156:53.51]Let me, uh, get rid of this.
[156:57.03]I don't have much to give, but seriously, Jerma, I fucking love you.
[157:00.09]Don't worry, bud.
[157:00.79]Don't worry.
[157:02.11]No one's ever expected to give money to me.
[157:03.97]Ever.
[157:04.39]So... I'm just happy that you're here and that we're kind of having fun together, so... That's all that matters to me.
[157:10.27]Ugh.
[157:10.99]What was I gonna do?
[157:11.65]I was gonna fucking... Uh... Quara, thanks for subbing, dude.
[157:18.11]My chair... This is gonna be ruined now.
[157:20.33]I need to go buy a new chair and a new keyboard.
[157:23.07]But this chair sucks anyway, so whatever.
[157:26.98]Okay.
[157:27.20]Well, I was going to do a poll to see what I was going to do here.
[157:32.05]So let's get a poll going.
[157:35.47]Oh, man.
[157:36.51]That made me like have way more boogers.
[157:42.36]Okay.
[157:43.78]Idle.
[157:47.60]Pray.
[157:50.68]Leave.
[157:53.66]Or destroy.
[157:54.20]Destroy.
[158:02.05]pray leave or destroy what do you guys want to do we'll let this go for a minute while we get our bearings thank you for voting if you vote I started this from a stupid shitty clip of Jerm I made the moment that made me laugh harder than I've ever laughed in my life I literally puked a little on my desk I honestly what I don't even know is this real
[158:25.53]Yeah, what even started that?
[158:27.51]Somebody linked, like, a random, like, Twitch clip of something, and I was like, oh, you, like, linked that.
[158:34.07]And... And then I just decided to tell everyone to do that.
[158:38.29]To keep linking clips.
[158:40.35]Don't ask me why.
[158:41.92]But that was a lot of fun.
[158:44.90]Oh, I was drunk when this happened and just lost it.
[158:48.60]I'm here for the zaps.
[158:50.72]If that doesn't go in the second channel... Oh, it absolutely will.
[158:52.76]It will.
[158:53.30]I can promise you that.
[158:58.29]It was me, yeah, it was you.
[159:00.00]It was never trustapurple was the one that started this all this nonsense.
[159:04.74]Destroy the idol seems to be winning.
[159:09.30]I subbed because of the clip.
[159:12.02]Yeah, somebody was like linking the Mafia 3 kick.
[159:14.76]That got in there.
[159:16.78]That's how, that's where the wrong clip line came from.
[159:26.54]Yeah, I don't even remember what the fuck that even just was.
[159:31.84]Yeah, somebody suggested to watch the clip of the clip and then I just kept clicking them.
[159:37.32]What a fucking psycho I am.
[159:39.02]What a real psychopath.
[159:43.78]No, that was a community effort.
[159:46.57]So well done, everybody.
[159:47.97]That was fucking hilarious.
[159:51.51]Cheers to you guys.
[159:57.69]Alright, looks like we're breaking the shrine.
[160:02.30]And then TNColin with 1500 bits.
[160:04.10]Holy shit, Jerma.
[160:05.28]I love you so much.
[160:06.18]I honestly have watched your YouTube at least 5,000 times.
[160:09.66]Well, thanks, man.
[160:11.71]I'm glad you like him so much.
[160:13.03]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[160:15.67]I am happy you enjoy the videos.
[160:18.13]Because you're the people I make them for.
[160:23.17]And then Sip.
[160:24.49]Sip.
[160:24.73]Thanks, Sip.
[160:25.49]Sippy Angelo.
[160:26.27]Sippy Angelo.
[160:27.51]Thank you.
[160:30.14]Oh, man.
[160:34.34]I'm not going to click any more of these clips because I know it'll start again.
[160:41.44]Yes, I record every single stream.
[160:43.89]So I have that kind of latched on forever.
[160:48.01]Alright.
[160:48.21]We're going to break the idol.
[160:49.11]Destroy the idol.
[160:49.77]I don't know what it's going to do, but we'll see.
[160:53.93]But thank you.
[160:56.37]Let's move on.
[160:57.11]Let's try to continue our sorcery playthrough.
[161:00.57]If it's even possible to recuperate at this point.
[161:02.67]Alright.
[161:04.22]Destroy.
[161:04.94]Destroy the idol.
[161:06.76]You smash the idol with a swipe of your blade.
[161:08.86]The clay lump shatters.
[161:10.86]There is the slightest tremor beneath your feet as if the idol's fragments spill onto the ground.
[161:17.28]The warmth of Throf's approval fills your chest.
[161:22.82]Okay.
[161:24.54]So this was another god that Throff doesn't like?
[161:27.27]I've had Throff for a long time.
[161:28.95]Surprised that she's still with me.
[161:32.81]When Jerma misses you a bit.
[161:34.05]Let me see.
[161:35.93]Where are you?
[161:36.73]Where for not?
[161:38.06]Where are you?
[161:41.50]There you are.
[161:41.94]Where for not?
[161:42.32]I can't remember when I laughed so hard.
[161:43.44]Never change.
[161:44.28]You never change, dude.
[161:47.71]and thank you the unsnackable for your subscription and renegade coaster before the bits giving you more because 100 wasn't enough for enough for making my night uh well I appreciate it dude I'm glad you could have some fun I bought bits for the first time well I am I'm humbled that you bought bits for me that is very very nice thing to do for somebody
[162:17.56]Alright, let's keep going.
[162:18.78]I'm going to leave.
[162:19.54]The sun climbs towards its peak.
[162:22.66]The winds pick up a little.
[162:25.14]So we came in through this door.
[162:28.08]We're going to go through this way.
[162:33.07]You pace on through the wall.
[162:34.39]Tall, swaying stems.
[162:35.73]Stocks break and crack around you as you walk.
[162:39.05]Ruins are filled.
[162:39.63]Let's go to the ruins.
[162:40.27]Ruins.
[162:43.27]You move onwards through the long grass.
[162:44.53]The grass here is strewn with rubble and rocks, which make the going difficult.
[162:48.69]The blocks have fallen from the outer wall, and a sheer drop beckons to the west.
[162:56.34]You would have gotten a higher stamina count if you had prayed.
[162:59.50]Well, but I would lose Throff, wouldn't I?
[163:03.18]Do I necessarily want to do that?
[163:04.18]I don't know.
[163:05.96]Alright, let's search the stones.
[163:07.75]You search through and around the stones.
[163:10.27]Eventually you come across something.
[163:11.73]A human arm bone underneath one large block.
[163:14.97]Presumably this unfortunate was standing below the wall when it fell.
[163:18.51]On his wrist is a bracelet made of tiny carved white beads.
[163:23.78]Free shit, I'll take it.
[163:25.92]You slip the bracelet from the skeleton and push it down onto your own wrist with a shiver.
[163:31.52]It's pure out over the edge.
[163:34.37]You peer down over the edge of the cliff and are quickly overcome by an overwhelming compulsion to jump and to fall.
[163:42.21]What?
[163:42.85]No, no, get away.
[163:44.85]You step away, but with every step back you feel a giddiness as though you were about to trip and stumble.
[163:51.75]What the fuck am I doing?
[163:53.68]Move away!
[163:56.05]You take another step backwards.
[163:57.23]This time you are sure that something is wrong.
[163:59.09]It is as though your legs were attached, the drop by chains, and those chains were being slowly tightened, ratchet by ratchet, dragging you towards the edge.
[164:09.28]Oh, no.
[164:12.42]Uh, the cliff edge.
[164:19.06]You come to your senses after about ten minutes of climbing to find yourself clinging to bare rock by your fingertips and the toes of your boots.
[164:28.30]The crumbled wall seems endlessly far above you, and thankfully you cannot move your head far enough to look down.
[164:35.11]Whatever force compelled you to come this way has lost its grip on you for the moment, but no doubt it is waiting at the top once more.
[164:43.21]Well, this is a good enough opportunity.
[164:44.99]Pray for aid.
[164:47.30]You close your eyes and raise a prayer to your goddess, but nothing changes.
[164:50.52]The rock wall grows, no handholds, and your fingers regain none of their failing strength.
[164:57.79]Fuck.
[164:59.61]You're about to open your arms to gather the starlight and cast a spell, hoping to levitate to the surface, or at least protect your body with a force field, but of course you cannot let go of the rock to begin casting.
[165:12.20]Climb back up.
[165:14.26]You begin to climb slowly laboriously back up the side of the cliff your heart is in your mouth with every stretch and every toehold Slowly the towers of manpang come back into sight and you are overtaken by a powerful urge to let go What why Should I like yeah
[165:40.81]I was listening to this while I was studying at the library.
[165:42.50]You made me laugh so hard I vomited.
[165:43.82]I had to run to a trash can so I wouldn't cause more of a scene.
[165:47.84]Holy shit.
[165:51.50]Let go.
[165:53.89]You open your fingers and let go.
[165:55.09]For a moment, the world seems to hover frozen in place.
[165:57.37]Then you begin to fall.
[166:00.61]Oh, shit.
[166:01.79]I put too much faith in my goddess falling down.
[166:07.36]You are falling and almost at the river.
[166:09.38]You can hear it rushing and splashing over rocks and stones.
[166:12.86]As it hurtles and spreads through the valleys below, what are you doing here?
[166:17.00]What misstep has led you to this point?
[166:19.08]What of your quest?
[166:20.84]Suddenly, without warning, you are retched from the air by something gripping your shoulders.
[166:27.68]You twist your neck to look around but can see nothing.
[166:30.19]To all appearances, you are now hovering in midair.
[166:36.74]There's nothing here.
[166:40.64]A gold-crest eagle?
[166:42.32]Surely so.
[166:43.98]And as the panic recedes, you hear the flap of wings.
[166:47.40]The eagles then are here, presumably to aid you, and for the moment, in secret.
[166:51.83]This one must have come out of hiding to save your life.
[166:57.45]The eagles!
[166:58.13]They're glorious!
[167:01.29]Thank you, Ninjutsun, for the sub.
[167:03.75]And Huffle... Huffle... Oh, God.
[167:08.47]Huff... Huffleumumpegus.
[167:11.86]Huffle... I can't fucking say your name.
[167:13.46]I'm delirious.
[167:15.12]Thank you, Huffle, for the 500 bits.
[167:17.68]Will I ever play with Star ever again?
[167:19.08]Not even TF2, just like anything.
[167:21.16]Yeah, I mean, we played Shadow Warrior together on stream, like, a couple weeks ago.
[167:27.44]Me and Star... Look, me and Star don't hate each other.
[167:29.08]I don't know... I don't know where that came from.
[167:32.43]It's rumors, man.
[167:33.15]Don't listen to rumors.
[167:35.13]We've been together for eight months.
[167:36.18]Is it time to get more serious?
[167:37.34]Thank you, Jake.
[167:40.36]I'd say, like, two-year-long relationship is when you get serious.
[167:45.86]I was gonna do 100 at a time, but the time is annoying.
[167:48.03]Make it stop.
[167:49.09]Thanks for the bits, dude.
[167:49.97]Appreciate it.
[167:50.85]KoiTF, thanks for subscribing.
[167:53.23]And Ninja again.
[167:54.55]500 bits again.
[167:58.28]Damn, dude.
[167:58.62]Thanks.
[168:00.07]Love your content.
[168:00.63]I almost fell out of my chair because I couldn't breathe.
[168:02.37]Keep up the great work.
[168:03.11]P.S.
[168:03.43]Wait, what is my text tone?
[168:05.69]Thank you for that.
[168:08.94]This bit thing is addicting.
[168:11.02]Addicting.
[168:15.60]Renegade coaster.
[168:16.88]Yeah.
[168:17.32]You guys, seriously.
[168:18.68]You guys are spoiling me right now.
[168:22.90]Thank you so much, guys.
[168:23.78]I don't deserve it, but thank you.
[168:26.39]I don't deserve this cash, but I've been rescued.
[168:32.67]You are now high.
[168:34.34]You are high now.
[168:35.22]Mampang is far below.
[168:36.68]Uh, I'm gonna say thank you.
[168:40.58]You call to the bird, but it makes no reply.
[168:42.00]The eagles cannot speak, only crow.
[168:44.42]And this one clearly prefers to be silent.
[168:47.58]Where's he gonna take me?
[168:49.02]Like, all the way around?
[168:54.35]The eagle climbs a little, swooping around the walls of Mampang towards an area of many turrets.
[169:00.83]A barefoot cool boy in zirconium flash.
[169:03.37]Thanks for subbing, guys.
[169:07.37]Is he gonna bring me back to where I was?
[169:08.47]I'll give a wave bye.
[169:30.44]You wave to the creature, hoping it escapes to its hiding spot without being detected.
[169:33.72]Then you look around to see where you have ended up.
[169:39.31]The ruined courtyard.
[169:45.79]Thanks, Renegade.
[169:48.39]You are by the base of a stone tower with a curved archway at its base.
[169:51.98]What is this place?
[169:53.38]It looks like no part of Mampang you have yet encountered.
[169:55.88]The air itself is somehow different.
[169:58.98]There is a tension here.
[170:00.79]The air itself feels tightened as though the world is stretched thin here.
[170:04.36]A taut drum skin pulled over too wide a frame.
[170:07.70]It feels as though the tiniest step might unleash a powerful rupture.
[170:13.74]You walk softly, hoping not to anger whatever powers control this place.
[170:21.73]Hmm.
[170:24.09]Nearby towers.
[170:26.72]You look over at the nearby tower.
[170:28.70]It is a squat and ugly, low, slightly squalid... Oh my god, I can't even read.
[170:34.82]Let's try that again.
[170:37.00]You look over at the nearby tower.
[170:38.67]It is squat and ugly, with a low, slightly squalid archway leading inside.
[170:44.09]But you must keep moving.
[170:44.85]Tower.
[170:50.27]Tower.
[170:53.29]Night has fallen.
[170:54.21]You need to rest, especially on an empty stomach.
[170:57.15]You cross the waters and push your way inside the crumbling tower without knowing what you might find.
[171:02.29]Once inside, you immediately break out into a smile.
[171:05.89]This tower might be gloomy, but it's certainly a relief after the ruin outside.
[171:12.68]Cast a spell.
[171:14.42]Uh... Look around.
[171:34.98]You have a quick peek around the room this way and that.
[171:37.18]It is curiously dark.
[171:39.08]You pay special attention to the corners, hoping to find something interesting.
[171:43.16]A colorful spider, maybe, or some nice juicy moss.
[171:47.22]You don't see anything.
[171:48.46]And after a while, start to feel a bit let down.
[171:50.47]Uh, look at the doors.
[171:59.39]You look over at the doors.
[172:00.69]There's one behind you and one in front.
[172:02.65]But when you try to count them, you find you can't quite manage it.
[172:06.21]It's probably because turning to look at one means the other one is behind, so you can't see it anymore.
[172:11.56]And you can hardly count something you can't see after all.
[172:15.02]Eventually, you decide there are most likely two doors here, even if you can't really be certain.
[172:20.90]What's wrong with my character?
[172:25.13]Sit down.
[172:27.31]You drop down onto all fours quite merrily.
[172:30.71]This is no kind of place to sleep, but it's a great place to cross your legs.
[172:35.04]You try crossing them one way and then the other, but neither way is really comfortable.
[172:39.96]You're forced to stand up once more.
[172:42.25]Clearly there's something wrong with the floor.
[172:47.87]Look at the floor.
[172:50.37]You pause where you stand to regard the cracks in the flagstones underfoot.
[172:54.41]You trace them this way and that, they form loops, branch, and then rejoin.
[172:58.70]It is, you realize after some time, almost as though all the stones fitted together.
[173:03.62]After tracing a crack for several minutes, only to have it disappear under your own boot, you look up once more.
[173:10.03]Wait, what?
[173:12.94]Leave.
[173:13.32]You head for the door but get distracted by the way the view of the world outside moves left and right a little as you sway from side to side.
[173:20.85]You are soon standing on the spot and just swaying.
[173:27.79]She's not helping me.
[173:30.37]Thanks, Shakeable Lake, for two months.
[173:32.21]Am I cool?
[173:32.61]Yeah, of course you are.
[173:35.34]Gatol3 or Gatol3, thanks for the sub, man.
[173:38.04]Welcome.
[173:40.30]Did I get Zirconium Flash?
[173:42.61]Did I get Zirconia?
[173:43.19]I don't think I got Zirconia in Flash.
[173:45.73]And JakeXLlama, 8 months.
[173:48.73]Did I even say your name?
[173:50.97]God, I feel like I'm the character inside here right now.
[173:54.74]Pray for aid.
[173:56.52]You close your eyes and attempt to offer a prayer, but end up singing a song from your childhood instead.
[174:02.19]Five sightmasters wearing spiky hats.
[174:05.29]The song brings a smile to your face, and it must be said, a tear to your eye.
[174:10.21]Why would you leave?
[174:11.41]This empty chamber is fascinating.
[174:13.27]You turn around on the spot a few times to get a full view and fall over.
[174:16.53]You have another try for the door, though you are now turned around enough that you can't really be sure which way is which.
[174:23.19]Stepping out into the open, you feel a slight headache coming on, as though you had drunk too much ale.
[174:31.16]What the fuck was that?
[174:35.80]The east door.
[174:37.94]You step back out onto the path and follow it a short way.
[174:41.80]The moon climbs the sky, filling the world with thin silver light.
[174:45.44]Three paths meet at this point in the shadow of the eastern rock.
[174:48.18]From the eastern tower, you hear the faintest sound of music.
[174:52.17]The wind picks up a little spray from the water and splashes it into your face.
[174:55.31]It stings where it touches you.
[174:56.77]I'm not gonna sleep here.
[175:00.47]Are you shitting me?
[175:03.25]air crackles with secret energy what's with these like tin can houses nearby tower oh boy you enter the next tower nervously this chamber is large circular and peppered with dark alcoves the floor is pure marble as are the walls in the center standing on a pedestal of rough stone is a large sculpture of a ram
[175:32.36]study the statue you pause to admire the statue it is about twice your height cut smoothly into the glossy rock the craftsmanship is impressive sculpted fur that looks soft enough to touch there's only one flaw the eyes lack pupils and are instead solid white orbs you cannot shake the feeling that the statue is looking at you uh look around the room
[176:00.38]You scan the room, nothing moves, but the darkness in the alcoves might hide something.
[176:04.22]Across the room is a set of double doors, large enough that three ogres could walk through.
[176:09.01]Another doorway leads north, but the path in that direction has crumbled into ruin.
[176:16.28]Have some bits, Jerma.
[176:17.02]Well, thank you, Mexican.
[176:18.20]Mexican Tea Radio.
[176:20.76]Mexicant radio.
[176:22.00]Mexicant radio.
[176:23.58]And then Will Sarcasm thinks it's six months.
[176:25.82]Six months is half a year.
[176:26.76]Fuck, it's been half a year.
[176:28.26]It has been half a year.
[176:29.68]We all get older every day.
[176:35.06]Uh, I searched the alt clips.
[176:41.44]Oh, whoops.
[176:43.56]The luck with these towers, these weird things in every one of them.
[176:47.34]There's weird shit in every single tower.
[176:48.86]Oh, boy.
[176:49.95]Alright.
[176:51.65]I'm going to search the alcoves.
[176:53.47]You perk one of the alcoves.
[176:55.11]You pick one of the alcoves at random to explore.
[176:57.01]It seems bare at first, more of a stone niche than anything else.
[177:00.87]But then you see something piled in the corner.
[177:03.71]Just then, the statue behind you moves.
[177:07.42]Its marble body groans with strain as its head lifts to face you.
[177:12.39]It shakes itself, the stone flaking.
[177:15.05]Two blank eyes stare you down.
[177:17.23]It jerks and twitches as it raises its leg.
[177:19.47]It brings a hoof down onto the stone.
[177:21.36]Boom!
[177:22.40]The air shudders with the force of a single step.
[177:25.00]Boom!
[177:25.82]The ram descends from the pedestal, never taking its eyes off you.
[177:28.78]Boom!
[177:29.66]You shift your weight, ready to leap or attack, but the ram simply stares, unblinking and unmoving.
[177:35.64]Then it takes one more halting step, lowers its head, and begins to charge.
[177:47.19]Dodge sideways.
[177:48.45]You leap sideways, but the rampaging beast still clips you as it passes, knocking you to the floor.
[177:54.08]Dazed on the ground, you hear the thunderous steps as the creature turns.
[177:58.80]Fuck, I gotta get out of here.
[178:01.14]You get to your feet nauseous.
[178:03.30]By simply entering this room, you have sealed your fate.
[178:05.64]This is now a fight for your life.
[178:08.91]Is it now?
[178:12.01]You must sing!
[178:16.71]Oh yeah, sap!
[178:18.57]No.
[178:25.92]Six of us are gonna take this motherfucker on.
[178:28.86]Sap.
[178:30.22]Depression.
[178:32.37]I think I'd like to have, like, six of us and five of them distract this guy.
[178:40.14]I could do wall, too.
[178:41.98]Wall might be a good idea.
[178:54.31]I can't pop him.
[178:55.33]There's no P here.
[178:58.21]Uh, dumb?
[178:59.17]I can cause clumsiness.
[179:03.70]Call Slowness, I could Dawes.
[179:05.36]Slowness, that might work.
[179:09.11]I'm gonna go with the six.
[179:10.11]I'm gonna clone six of us.
[179:11.35]And we're gonna fucking run around in a circle.
[179:18.75]Visible three stamina though, that's so much.
[179:24.59]We're going with six.
[179:27.75]S-I-X.
[179:30.31]Do it.
[179:33.22]You move the starlight into order around you and five clones step out from behind you, forming a semicircle.
[179:38.52]The clones run in all directions, taunting the ram.
[179:41.83]The creature at first is confused, but falls for the bait, charging after the clones and leaving the way clear for you to run for the far door.
[179:49.59]Get out.
[179:51.29]You tug on the far doors of the chamber, but they do not budge.
[179:53.97]The ram pulverizes your faithful clones one by one until the room is littered with broken bodies, each with your features.
[180:03.07]You turn from the frightful sight and face the door.
[180:05.47]You weave the enchantment of the double doors at the end, fly open, then begin to fall shut once more under their own weight.
[180:25.02]You dive quickly through, gasping for air.
[180:31.40]Let's get out of here.
[180:32.96]So each one of these towers has just something fucking stupid in them?
[180:40.93]You stand atop a short walkway between two towers.
[180:44.39]A stone archway passage holds a doorway, but the door has been bricked over.
[180:48.62]The work looks shoddy and rushed.
[180:52.64]Kick the wall.
[180:54.45]you kick the wall it bows with the blow mortar crumbling away it is weakened for just a moment you catch the sound of muttering coming from somewhere nearby kick the wall again kick the wall again the weakened wall does not crumble but you do hurt your foot listen you press your ear to a gap in the mortar you hear grunting scratching and the tearing of flesh
[181:23.36]There is a thump as something is thrown against the wall and what might be a bone snapping.
[181:30.84]Break this whole... Break it down.
[181:34.25]You push against the weakened spot in the wall where you kicked and it gives way.
[181:37.57]The bricks crumble inwards leaving a choking cloud of dust.
[181:41.21]A moment later, two goblins squeeze through the hole in the wall knocking you to the ground in their haste.
[181:46.86]It seems they were bricked up inside the tower.
[181:54.54]Look in the room.
[181:56.62]The sight that meets your eyes is truly foul.
[182:00.08]The room within the tower is crowded with goblins, both living and dead.
[182:05.03]It seems they have been trapped here for some time.
[182:07.69]The walls and floor are slick with gore, layers and layers of it.
[182:12.45]The goblins themselves do not seem to have noticed you.
[182:15.26]They are too busy rolling this way and that fighting.
[182:20.32]Jesus.
[182:21.66]Keep watching.
[182:23.70]As you watch, a new goblin pops into existence quite from nowhere.
[182:27.37]She whips her head around in confusion for a second before being tackled to the ground by three others.
[182:32.87]They snap her neck and tear into her flesh.
[182:36.20]They eat her raw.
[182:39.78]The scene is repeated a moment later in another part of the room.
[182:42.44]There are clumps of hair and teeth littering the corners.
[182:47.78]I'm going in.
[182:49.34]Stealing your courage and with your hand at your sword held, you step inside the foul-spelling tower.
[182:55.44]Why the fuck am I doing this?
[182:59.62]You step into the chamber.
[183:00.56]The smell is worse than you could have imagined.
[183:03.13]A few of the goblins look up from their rampant cannibalism to stare at you with slack-jawed expressions.
[183:08.61]How long have they been stuck here?
[183:12.21]Hold on.
[183:13.35]One second.
[183:13.75]I gotta blow it out.
[183:22.12]Okay.
[183:24.68]Cast a spell.
[183:33.65]Gak.
[183:34.17]Cause fear.
[183:37.05]That would have been great right now.
[183:38.79]Worship.
[183:39.47]God.
[183:42.91]Jig.
[183:43.23]There is no jig.
[183:44.52]There's no J. Okay.
[183:48.54]huff I could just cause a store is gonna be disgusting I'm doing it I don't even care huff consulting the constellations overhead you bind the spell placing your gale horn to your lips and playing a clear tone the goblins cover their ears with their hands but the noise that issues is much quieter than the roar of the wind that follows it bowls through the tiny chamber sending the creatures piling up against the far wall
[184:16.93]With the crazed mob cowed by your spellcasting, you have a moment to act.
[184:22.29]Go for the fire door.
[184:22.99]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[184:24.79]You take advantage of the lull to race across the room.
[184:26.89]The door to the east is locked, and the door in the west wall is open.
[184:33.93]Open the east door.
[184:34.51]Get it open.
[184:36.71]You try the door.
[184:37.35]It is locked.
[184:37.95]Your spell will not last much longer.
[184:39.51]If you cannot escape, you will be trapped in here with these creatures.
[184:43.33]You try your keys in turn, but nothing fits the lock.
[184:46.63]Your spell gives out and the goblins begin creeping.
[184:48.39]Smash the door!
[184:50.24]You charge the door with your shoulder and it shudders, but it does not break.
[184:53.62]Goblins leech up, clutching your arms and chest in a frenzy.
[184:57.78]You are brought down, rolling along the sticky floor as more pile on top of you.
[185:02.25]Pain flares up along your body as the crazed goblins tear into your flesh.
[185:08.61]Ah, fuck.
[185:10.49]Fight!
[185:12.63]You see...
[185:14.71]You try to fight, but your limbs are pinned.
[185:16.51]The creature's already flaying strips of skin.
[185:20.39]You convulse as your gut is ripped open.
[185:24.35]Looking down, you see two fighting over your liver, shoving each other away as they devour it.
[185:33.50]You open your mouth to cry out, but a beefy goblin kneels down on your throat, fingers clawing at the sweet taste of your eyes.
[185:40.18]Long nails find their target, and everything goes black.
[185:45.89]What's my fate?
[185:46.55]You've been devoured by goblins.
[185:49.29]Once again, death grasps you and its icy hands only lift you up impossibly high upwards!
[186:01.14]Catch pig!
[186:04.10]That's Z-E-D-Zed.
[186:09.68]The spell finishes in a blinding net of starlight that winds around your body like a sheet.
[186:14.65]Oh god.
[186:19.80]Oh, fuck me.
[186:26.94]The second time is no more pleasant than the first.
[186:29.44]The pain builds and then you explode outwards, teeth and skull and limbs flying in all directions.
[186:34.27]Once more the explosion dies back as though receding.
[186:37.37]You look around yourself once more.
[186:39.55]You've lost another point of maximum stamina.
[186:46.06]You pat yourself down.
[186:47.02]You're quite alive.
[186:47.72]What is more, you have all your possessions and gold and knowledge.
[186:51.90]It must be morning now.
[186:52.70]You've been awake all night and been weaker.
[186:54.77]Are you shitting me?
[186:55.85]I just teleported through space and time.
[187:00.81]Well, we're back here again.
[187:03.01]We rewind to this spot every time we die.
[187:06.95]Fuck.
[187:08.91]I gotta pee.
[187:09.87]I'll be right back.
[188:01.99]Wait, what?
[188:41.74]Goddamn.
[188:45.13]I'm peeing so-
[189:22.86]Oh fuck, I really was muted.
[189:23.96]Holy shit.
[189:26.40]You really got me.
[189:27.26]Yeah, I would not... You know what?
[189:28.64]We would have just played for like at least 10 minutes before I noticed.
[189:30.74]Alright, so let's take a look at where we were.
[189:41.09]So I went... God, I wish I had those red markers.
[189:43.77]I really do.
[189:44.49]Even if you... When you get sent back in time.
[189:48.98]We went through here.
[189:49.62]I bought the sword.
[189:50.84]I got the money from here, right?
[189:54.40]I did this.
[189:54.94]I did Effie.
[189:56.96]Got the sword.
[189:57.66]Talked to the rock.
[189:59.78]Went this way.
[190:01.58]Down here.
[190:02.40]Did the smash the idol.
[190:04.03]Fell down.
[190:04.47]Got picked up by the eagle.
[190:06.55]There's a lot of fucking towers over here.
[190:08.49]And there were the same things over on this side, too.
[190:12.23]Oh, boy.
[190:12.61]Okay.
[190:14.63]This time, let's go this way.
[190:19.57]Did I die again?
[190:20.43]Yeah, I did.
[190:23.71]Could get some more money, I could.
[190:24.87]I also haven't even looked in, like, here.
[190:27.31]Or here, if I even can.
[190:32.82]Stream is sponsored by Totino's Pizza Rolls?
[190:38.54]No, it isn't.
[190:39.60]I don't have a sponsored stream.
[190:40.70]What are you talking about, man?
[190:43.16]Alright, let's just go.
[190:43.84]Oh, I want to talk to... You guys said I killed a Sightmaster, like, four games ago.
[190:49.37]Let's go talk to her then.
[190:51.04]See if I can have that option.
[190:55.40]Sleep against the statue.
[190:56.46]No, no sleeping.
[190:59.36]Statue of the Archmage.
[191:03.27]Do I not have the option to talk to the beggar again?
[191:08.09]Wasn't she right here?
[191:12.67]Come on now.
[191:13.43]What?
[191:15.92]Yeah.
[191:18.26]Fuck, it's now nighttime and I'm like stuck here.
[191:20.30]The market is shuttered up for the night.
[191:21.89]I sleep under a damn stall.
[191:25.47]You find a stall to curl up underneath.
[191:26.67]You should be shut up here and hopefully out of sight.
[191:28.75]You lay your pack down.
[191:31.11]Lots of strange noises.
[191:32.29]I'm going to eat one of my provisions.
[191:35.06]Feel quite safe and you do not dream.
[191:36.64]You lost some max stamina, ate a provision, searched the wheat fields, died again, and found no new clues.
[191:49.99]thank you cyber risk thank you cyber risk it for your new sub in the middleman's 11 months coffee cheetos question mark I wonder what the question mark is could be anything thanks for 11 months dude almost a year alright you're awoken by a stall owner kicking you out from under her stand by the time you scramble away you've sustained some bruising great which way now

[192:21.23]Yeah, there she is.
[192:21.79]Okay, good.
[192:23.15]So, I... You guys... Did you not fuck with me?
[192:25.17]I did kill somebody.
[192:25.93]I did kill a, uh... Sightmaster.
[192:31.88]Drop a coin in the well.
[192:33.46]I got plenty of money.
[192:34.32]Oh, fuck.
[192:37.14]I thought that was her, like, little spot.
[192:40.20]Waste of good gold.
[192:42.23]Oh, goddammit.
[192:42.95]Go greet her.
[192:44.89]There she is.
[192:48.51]Uh, give her a coin.
[192:49.41]Am I going to go through all this bullshit again?
[192:54.08]Alright, who are you?
[192:56.98]You're a beggar.
[192:58.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[192:59.40]Why did you stop?
[193:00.04]Sightmasters, why did you stop healing?
[193:01.36]Oh, I don't know why I stopped.
[193:02.82]Sightmasters in Mampang?
[193:05.96]Oh, I can help you.
[193:06.70]Uh, what do I get in return?
[193:11.31]Okay.
[193:15.13]Okay, tell me what happened to your eyes.
[193:16.23]Yadda yadda yadda.
[193:18.99]Oh, what happened?
[193:20.29]Oh, no.
[193:22.21]So those creatures should be... Well, how you survived.
[193:26.41]Okay.
[193:27.63]I've killed a sightmaster.
[193:36.95]I've killed a sightmaster.
[193:37.87]You lie.
[193:38.67]I didn't even do it.
[193:40.79]You're a silver-tongued one, aren't you?
[193:42.27]You know all the right things to say, but it's no good.
[193:44.44]I'm not stupid.
[193:45.74]I got sight.
[193:47.12]Oh, fuck.
[193:50.74]Ah, damn it.
[193:55.90]I want to go this way.
[193:56.66]We're going to go to the center.
[193:57.78]We're going to go that way.
[194:00.21]Got him.
[194:00.67]Got him.
[194:01.63]That's what you're going to say?
[194:02.31]Got him?
[194:04.15]God damn it.
[194:05.19]We're going to head east.
[194:10.49]East side.
[194:16.29]Okay, let's go.
[194:19.12]The buildings on the eastern edge are a little more ramshackle.
[194:22.07]An arch leads to another smaller yard.
[194:24.53]An alley runs past it.
[194:26.55]A pillory sits to the north of here.
[194:28.59]As the sun climbs towards its peak, the winds blowing between the buildings pick up a little.
[194:32.42]Okay.
[194:35.84]Make a move.
[194:37.38]You can cross the square or explore the fringes.
[194:39.76]There's the pillory.
[194:40.72]There's the guy again.
[194:43.88]What is in here?
[194:46.97]Ooh, this is a new room.
[194:49.52]You stroll through the arch into a well-appointed empty courtyard.
[194:52.84]From a small booth by the entranceway, a guard nods to you.
[194:56.35]Brother?
[194:56.63]Okay, this is a... This place is pretty fucking huge, okay.
[195:03.46]Courtyard.
[195:07.63]You step out into the central courtyard that fills this enclosure.
[195:10.63]The place is blessedly quiet, with several routes leading out of it.
[195:14.85]A dome looks up at the sky and you spot the occasional birdman flying overhead.
[195:18.57]A fountain plays in the center of the courtyard.
[195:25.04]Search the courtyard.
[195:27.44]You look around the courtyard, but there isn't much to see beyond the fountain and the benches that surround it.
[195:31.92]The doors are a mixture of shops and storage rooms.
[195:35.23]A few brightly feathered birds flap past overhead.
[195:37.91]This little square is almost comfortable.
[195:41.59]Look at the fountain.
[195:43.40]The water from the fountain plays merrily over several stone statues set into the center of the bowl.
[195:48.60]Arching satyrs, weeping maidens, aged men, head-butting orcs.
[195:54.41]It must tell some legend, but what that legend might be has been clearly lost to time in the wearing water.
[196:01.94]Drink from the fountain.
[196:03.88]You cup a handful of the sparkling water to rinse it to your lips.
[196:06.98]A moment later, you spit it out, gasping for breath.
[196:08.92]The water is quite foul.
[196:10.17]Oh, that's gross.
[196:11.07]Okay, move on.
[196:13.95]A door leads up... This guy, this guy's name.
[196:17.61]A door leads out to the main square of the inner city, but there are several other doors leading off from the courtyard.
[196:22.51]One is signposted Nylok.
[196:26.19]Oh, deary me.
[196:28.51]Nylok was the guy that is a bad guy, right?
[196:36.29]Satyrs.
[196:40.55]Satyrs.
[196:41.29]Satyrs.
[196:42.23]Whatever the fuck it is.
[196:42.93]Who cares?
[196:45.13]Side chamber.
[196:49.22]You slip into a small side room.
[196:51.34]Inside are a pile of crates and a side room that are marked with the seal of Kare.
[196:56.92]Open one of the crates.
[196:59.19]Robbed this fucking place.
[197:00.11]The crates are nailed shut, but you manage to slip your cutlass between the two boards.
[197:03.36]You pry off the lid.
[197:05.60]Stacks of cloth, spearheads, and other miscellaneous goods.
[197:08.42]Much of it is junk, but the marks indicated originated in Kare.
[197:12.58]Do these date from before the goblin attack, or is it possible someone escaped the city's destruction?
[197:20.27]Okay.
[197:21.85]There are several stacked crates, each bearing Kare custom stamps that predate the destruction of the city.
[197:26.75]What are they doing here?
[197:28.62]A few large empty crates lie undisturbed at the back of the room.
[197:34.87]Open an empty crate.
[197:37.59]You open one of the large crates, empty and roomy.
[197:41.27]It occurs to you that you could hide your monk's habit in one of the boxes for later use.
[197:45.29]Should I do that now?
[197:59.33]Uh, no, I'm gonna keep it on.
[198:03.27]Not now.
[198:04.09]Courtyard.
[198:06.13]Yeah, Car Ray was destroyed.
[198:07.15]It was, uh, burnt to the ground.
[198:11.54]Okay, the Sun and Man Pang.
[198:12.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:13.26]Let's move on.
[198:13.84]Which way?
[198:14.44]We're gonna go to... Might as well explore each little room, right?
[198:18.74]Guard's room.
[198:22.74]You approach the guard's room.
[198:23.82]The guard turns to you with narrowed, unfriendly eyes.
[198:27.28]What?
[198:31.26]There's a thief in the courtyard.
[198:35.02]She shrugs.
[198:36.04]There is.
[198:37.06]Her name is Nylok.
[198:38.98]With that, she waves you away.
[198:40.28]You head back to the courtyard.
[198:49.05]You step out into the courtyard once more.
[198:50.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:56.27]Side chamber, dark hallway, Nylok shop.
[199:00.42]Let's go to Nylock's shop.
[199:05.08]Look at this mess.
[199:08.40]You enter a trade post of some kind.
[199:10.30]A bald woman with one eye leans on a counter, flanked by shelves stacked with goods and trinkets.
[199:18.64]At this moment, she's talking to a shoddily dressed traveler.
[199:23.66]The merchant Nylock glances up as you enter, then returns to her bargaining.
[199:29.90]Steal something.
[199:30.62]I'm gonna listen and wait.
[199:34.20]The merchant is shaking her head, not meeting the eyes of the traveler.
[199:38.39]Listen, I do what you have.
[199:41.37]Oh no, let me redo that.
[199:42.93]Listen, I do want what you have, but if I buy it at that price, the archmage will have my head.
[199:49.13]I'm already doing you a favor by not tossing you out.
[199:53.17]I see.
[199:54.47]I must give this some thought.
[199:57.87]Keep listening.
[199:59.34]You hover listening, but the trader behind the counter has noticed you.
[200:03.12]Well, and what do you want?
[200:06.44]The man at the counter seems to notice you for the first time.
[200:09.54]Something about the man seems familiar, and it would appear the feeling is mutual.
[200:14.86]You, the man gasps.
[200:20.36]Indeed, you reply with no idea who the man is.
[200:24.76]I saw you in the darkness when the gate opened and we were overrun.
[200:31.42]Shit.
[200:33.56]Vic?
[200:34.26]Sansus?
[200:35.60]Who are you?
[200:36.18]Think back.
[200:38.42]Vic?
[200:42.57]It's not Flanker.
[200:43.33]I would have recognized Flanker.
[200:45.09]It's definitely not Flanker.
[200:52.91]Is it Vic or Sansus?
[200:54.27]Wasn't Sansus killed?
[200:59.78]Think back.
[201:02.70]Is it Lorag?
[201:08.22]Think for once in your life, please.
[201:12.16]Sansus is dead.
[201:15.97]Isn't Vic dead too?
[201:21.47]Fuck.
[201:23.07]I feel like I have to get this right.
[201:32.32]It's the time, sir, but I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, Vic.
[201:36.55]Vic?
[201:37.93]But of course!
[201:39.13]You must have seen sketches of my face, at least, on the walls and pamphlets that covered Kare.
[201:43.45]The man puffs out his chest.
[201:45.31]Vic Shenshal.
[201:47.00]First noble of the city port of thieves.
[201:49.54]In exile now, of course.
[201:51.30]And you, I think, are you the Anorlander?
[201:55.80]You see the hatred in his eyes as hot as fire.
[202:01.50]You are mistaken.
[202:03.76]You insist.
[202:05.50]Anorlander?
[202:06.76]Nylock asks, still intent on her ledger.
[202:09.97]You don't know about the Anorlander?
[202:12.21]This is the foul crobbler that destroyed Kari, and he's here bent on destroying Mampang now, I shouldn't wonder.
[202:19.25]Pack your bags, Nylock.
[202:20.79]This one leaves nothing standing.
[202:24.19]No way out of Mampang anyway, and I just bumped my hand on my desk.
[202:28.21]It hurt a little.
[202:31.64]Kari wasn't my fault, and I'd do it again.
[202:38.46]Should I just dial the dick up to 100?
[202:40.28]Yeah, I did, and I'd fucking do it again.
[202:47.55]Crobbler.
[202:51.17]And I'd do it again!
[202:53.43]He heaves with rage.
[202:55.05]You barbarian!
[202:56.67]I'll have nothing to do with you!
[202:58.39]I hope you rot in one of the Archmage's cells or get eaten by a skunk bear!
[203:03.57]He goes over to a pile of papers still muttering to himself and begins sorting through them.
[203:07.98]Nyluck is unimpressed.
[203:14.32]Karei sucked.
[203:15.00]That place was trash.
[203:21.25]Regard Nylock.
[203:24.29]You regard the traitor properly next.
[203:26.81]Nylock leans over a ledger and looks like she has held that same pose for a hundred years or more.
[203:35.94]It wants me to steal so bad.
[203:39.14]Actually, funny you mention that.
[203:40.42]We have been eaten by a skunk bear like five times.
[203:42.68]Yeah, you're right.
[203:46.12]Ask Nylock about her good...
[203:49.91]You stroll over to the back of the room.
[203:53.85]Isn't she just watching me do this?
[203:57.41]Vic and Nylock are both distracted by their bargaining.
[204:00.40]You pretend to examine a stack of pelts while spying some likely trinkets from the corner of your eye.
[204:07.24]Grab something and run.
[204:09.38]Quietly pocket something or don't risk it.
[204:16.68]Alright, quietly pocket something.
[204:19.67]You knock over a pot with practiced ease, making excuses as you replace it on the shelf.
[204:24.91]As you do so, you slip a black face mask into your pocket.
[204:31.20]Hey, so, uh, what kind of goods are traded here, you know?
[204:36.28]What?
[204:37.39]Oh, you're still here?
[204:38.21]I'm robbing you.
[204:45.45]I'm robbing you.
[204:53.83]That's so forthcoming.
[204:56.37]Dude, how many times have I gained and lost the face mask?
[204:59.69]I think it's been at least three times.
[205:06.40]Ugh.
[205:10.62]Steal when I have that much money.
[205:14.21]Honesty.
[205:14.67]Mm-hmm.
[205:22.65]I'm robbing you.
[205:25.31]Vic looks shocked.
[205:26.91]Nylock doesn't look up.
[205:28.35]That's nice.
[205:31.02]I said I'm robbing you.
[205:32.90]You wave your hand in front of her face.
[205:35.30]I heard you.
[205:36.50]I've got one eye, but two ears.
[205:39.08]Vic raises an eyebrow at you.
[205:41.46]What did I tell you?
[205:42.78]He remarks to Nylock.
[205:55.55]I need to pull for this one.
[205:56.59]I can't do it.
[205:57.94]I cannot be... No, I need to pull.
[206:04.56]What do I do?
[206:07.56]Grab something.
[206:09.81]Striker.
[206:13.01]Or laugh it off.
[206:15.95]This is so weird.
[206:17.01]Why?
[206:17.43]What is going on?
[206:21.14]Alright, guys.
[206:21.64]What do I do?
[206:27.80]I'm robbing you.
[206:29.12]I'm robbing you.
[206:30.76]That's nice.
[206:39.37]Laugh it off is currently winning.
[206:44.53]Strike her.
[206:45.21]Laugh it off.
[206:45.77]Grab something.
[206:46.51]Laugh it off.
[206:51.38]Please vote strike her.
[206:57.66]Oh, look at me.
[206:58.46]I'm chat.
[206:59.12]I'm no fun.
[206:59.92]This whole playthrough is botched.
[207:13.27]Oh, man.
[207:14.45]I love this game.
[207:15.69]This whole series is like just a total joy to play through.
[207:18.29]I hope you guys are enjoying it as much as I am.
[207:21.57]It's a lot of fun.
[207:29.63]What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
[207:33.74]Alright, 10 seconds.
[207:34.86]Looks like Laffadoff is going to win.
[207:41.40]45 to 40%.
[207:45.08]Strike.
[207:45.82]Strike.
[207:46.54]Oh god.
[207:47.14]I want to change my vote to hit her.
[207:55.00]Let's play it all over again.
[207:56.06]No, I don't want to play it again.
[207:57.70]I don't want to start and do different stuff.
[207:59.86]If you guys want to buy it, if you guys want to get it, I'd rather you be able to experience different things than me.
[208:10.39]Like, could I go to the very beginning and play through part one again and do different shit?
[208:13.81]Sure.
[208:14.97]But I'd like it if you guys could experience it too.
[208:17.98]Like on your own, kind of, if you ever had the urge to play it.
[208:21.60]Alright.
[208:23.00]Poll is closing in three, two, one.
[208:28.52]Laugh it off.
[208:29.34]We're just going to laugh.
[208:32.67]Thank you for voting.
[208:33.71]Appreciate it.
[208:35.73]Poll is closed.
[208:37.19]Laugh it off.
[208:41.31]I see cock-a-bat humor does not go down well in this citadel.
[208:46.43]Nylok shrugs.
[208:48.39]I sold my sense of humor for my husband's legacy, rest his soul.
[208:52.25]I don't miss either.
[208:55.54]I want to buy something.
[208:58.66]Good for you.
[208:59.72]He browses around her stock.
[209:02.62]Buy four blood candles, brass pendulum, golden egg, provisions.
[209:08.81]Just buy it all.
[209:10.39]Four blood candles.
[209:11.17]I'll take them.
[209:13.67]Gutsy.
[209:15.87]They're just candles, Vic observes.
[209:18.33]Vic is fusing around at the back of the shop.
[209:23.31]Why do you say that?
[209:24.91]You demand.
[209:25.73]But Nyluck refuses to elaborate.
[209:28.33]Ignore her, these manpanigans.
[209:31.34]Nyluck makes a mark in her ledger to note the sale.
[209:36.53]Fucking, we're bloated right now.
[209:37.87]Buy it all.
[209:39.31]You buy the brass pendulum, and Nylok nods.
[209:42.65]You must have a very specific clock to fix, but you're welcome to it.
[209:46.84]The trader smiles icily, perhaps hoping you'll buy more, perhaps hoping you'll leave.
[209:51.20]Vic watches you with jealous interest.
[209:54.00]And I'll take a fucking golden egg from a golden goose.
[209:57.34]You buy a golden egg built inside a gold-spun nest.
[210:00.86]Nylok doesn't know what it's for.
[210:03.64]For a lady friend, maybe.
[210:06.20]Vic teases.
[210:08.54]Buy some provisions.
[210:10.40]How many provisions do I get for eight gold?
[210:12.62]How many?
[210:13.24]You get a meal.
[210:14.16]Take it or don't.
[210:18.16]That's extortionate.
[210:20.04]It's the price.
[210:21.22]It's robbery.
[210:22.43]Like the other price that we were discussing.
[210:24.65]Fine, buy it.
[210:25.13]I don't give a shit.
[210:25.99]I'll take it.
[210:29.35]Everybody has to eat.
[210:30.61]You sell some strange things.
[210:35.49]Go to the market if you want the usual stuff.
[210:37.37]Don't bother me about it.
[210:38.49]That's enough.
[210:40.09]I have some questions for you.
[210:43.62]Good for you.
[210:44.66]Picking her teeth.
[210:45.54]This lady doesn't say shit.
[210:48.52]What can you tell me about the Archmage?
[210:50.48]He employs me.
[210:51.18]You know anything about the crown?
[210:54.80]The what?
[210:56.02]The crown of kings.
[210:57.94]She underlines something.
[211:00.00]Never heard of it.
[211:02.54]Where's the Archmage?
[211:04.44]Here in Manpang, of course.
[211:06.90]In the spike?
[211:08.18]Maybe.
[211:08.64]He's probably dead.
[211:09.90]But I didn't say that.
[211:10.85]I just handled the training.
[211:14.65]You've never seen the Archmage, then?
[211:18.01]No, but the guards talk about him often enough.
[211:20.85]Always talk him up.
[211:22.41]She pauses to scratch.
[211:24.11]Scratching my asshole.
[211:26.76]Now, she says, do you want anything else?
[211:29.34]I'm leaving.
[211:31.00]Splendid.
[211:32.65]Vic salutes you.
[211:34.06]Be seeing you, he grumbles.
[211:36.30]For the last look at Vic, you head for the courtyard outside, but as you reach the door, you hear Nylock mutter.
[211:43.22]I bet he stole something, she says to Vic.
[211:47.30]Oh, he probably has.
[211:48.40]That's it?
[211:51.75]Free shit?
[211:52.53]Nice.
[211:55.73]I move on.
[211:57.21]Which way?
[211:57.81]I haven't gone down here yet.
[211:59.27]Side chamber.
[211:59.55]Side chamber.
[212:03.07]what is this little freak like hiding behind the bed oh that's just look at this creepy image you choose a small side door which opens to reveal a dirty living quarters a bare rug covers the floor and an unmade bed lists in the corner a wood chest sits at its foot facing an empty table this is presumably home to some lowly guard or other
[212:35.48]Uh, examine the bed.
[212:39.02]You go over to the bed and rifle through the ratty covers to discover nothing but a stained mattress.
[212:44.24]Hay pokes out of one side.
[212:46.06]It doesn't look like anyone has slept in it for a while.
[212:50.36]Look under the bed.
[212:52.42]You peer underneath the bed with your weapon drawn, but all you find is an old shirt.
[212:56.24]Wait, what?
[212:59.48]Dig in the hay.
[213:00.71]You dig around in the hay and discover the last rat to attempt the same thing, but nothing more.
[213:07.72]lie down the room seems safe enough so you rest the bed is uncomfortable but you still feel refreshed after a short time stand up you get to your feet once more then you hear a slight click from the ceiling a portcullis begins to drop across the doorway
[213:29.05]Jump.
[213:30.17]You dash forward and take a heroic leap for the closing gap, but you don't make it.
[213:34.71]The gate catches you in the leg, pinning you into place.
[213:38.37]The hissing noise grows from somewhere behind you.
[213:41.81]Struggle.
[213:43.37]Oh, God.
[213:45.23]No, you struggle against the door, but you cannot move.
[213:47.49]The portcullis has fallen through your leg.
[213:50.43]The fumes surround you now, a choking green cloud.
[213:53.50]As your life gives out, you see something white floating near your eyes.
[213:59.69]Look.
[214:01.70]You struggle to focus your eyes as a toothy grin moves down to eye level.
[214:05.40]There we are.
[214:08.12]That wasn't so hard.
[214:10.54]There is a snap as the death wraith breaks off a finger and it goes away, chomping happily.
[214:17.69]You've been poisoned.
[214:21.69]Fuck.
[214:23.50]I want to go back in there and...
[214:28.84]Fucking Zed.
[214:30.88]Wake me up inside.
[214:31.88]At least it's right here.
[214:37.50]18 stamina now.
[214:43.91]Fuck.
[214:44.17]Alright, well that's not going to happen again.
[214:49.51]Into the square and I'm going right back here.
[214:50.91]I want to explode that other room.
[214:56.26]I lost one more max stamina.
[214:57.86]That's fine.
[214:58.56]Who cares?
[215:03.99]Guard's asleep.
[215:04.77]Let's go back in that room.
[215:05.95]I'm fucking cutting somebody's face off.
[215:15.09]There it is.
[215:15.59]Okay.
[215:16.87]Not gonna happen again.
[215:20.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[215:21.35]Wood chest.
[215:21.81]It's a foot.
[215:22.67]But you know this room is for what it is.
[215:24.13]It's a trap.
[215:25.78]Pull up the rug.
[215:28.52]You grab the edge of the rug, cutlass at the ready, flip it over.
[215:32.50]You flip it aside to find a small trap door set into the floor of the room.
[215:36.30]Open it.
[215:40.65]You grasp the handle and pull with all your might, but it doesn't budge.
[215:43.45]The door doesn't even rattle.
[215:46.92]Examine it closely.
[215:47.78]You feel along the edges, discovering that it's a fake.
[215:52.33]The wood has merely been cleverly cut to appear like a trapdoor.
[215:54.97]You let the rug fall once more.
[215:57.65]Leave.
[216:00.17]Oh, come on.
[216:00.75]You stroll towards the doorway, then you hear a slight click from the ceiling.
[216:04.67]Look around.
[216:05.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[216:06.15]You hear a hissing noise.
[216:09.57]You look quickly around, but see nothing from somewhere nearby.
[216:11.57]You hear a hissing noise.
[216:12.55]Yeah.
[216:14.01]Look up.
[216:17.46]You look up to see a greenish cloud descend from the ceiling.
[216:20.24]Poison gas.
[216:22.08]This is not anyone's living quarters.
[216:23.68]This room is nothing but a trap, and you have walked straight into it.
[216:27.61]Break open the portcullis, hold my breath, cast a spell.
[216:34.27]Alright.
[216:35.87]We're going with, uh... Can we zip?
[216:39.55]No.
[216:40.48]Can't teleport out of the fucking room.
[216:41.82]Okay.
[216:44.67]It's burning.
[216:45.73]Oh, no, no, no.
[216:46.73]Huff.
[216:47.73]Ooh!
[216:48.67]Galehorn, baby.
[216:49.43]Blow it away.
[216:53.03]You cast a spell, placing your Galehorn to your lips and playing a clear tone.
[216:55.87]The mighty Gale howls about the room, blowing the poison gas out through the portcullis.
[217:00.79]The clean air tastes sweet.
[217:02.89]You approach the portcullis.
[217:06.42]I hope I'm saying that name right.
[217:10.54]Look over the portcullis.
[217:11.74]Looking over the gate, you can see it descends from a hidden panel in the ceiling, but you can't see any switches or levers on the walls either side.
[217:21.05]Lift the gate.
[217:22.69]In your healthy condition, you have no trouble lifting the gate.
[217:24.84]It rolls up and you hold it aloft before diving under it.
[217:31.06]Problem solved.
[217:31.70]That's right.
[217:32.62]Sweet air.
[217:35.63]Alright.
[217:35.95]One more place to check.
[217:37.19]One more place to go.
[217:39.66]And that's, God, there's way more than one more place to go.
[217:44.62]Dark hallway.
[217:48.61]Thank you, you veins, for two months.
[217:51.97]Much appreciated.
[217:52.77]Welcome back.
[217:54.81]At the far end of the courtyard is a gloomy hallway.
[217:57.43]It seems like a strange addition to the otherwise clean merchant's quarter.
[218:03.48]Far end.
[218:06.89]You emerge into a small, dirt-filled room.
[218:09.71]There is an untidy pile of timber in the center and a door at the far end.
[218:15.36]Search the room.
[218:16.58]There's a little bit of dust, and it gets into your nostrils from the timber on the ground, and you sneeze.
[218:23.28]As far as you can see, the only thing in the room is the pile of wood in the middle of the floor.
[218:26.75]The timber looks half-rotten.
[218:28.57]It is covered in curious black splotches.
[218:35.13]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[218:37.19]I wanted to kick it.
[218:39.17]I fat-fingered this with a tiny finger.
[218:47.24]No, look at the far door.
[218:51.36]You cross the room and rattle the handle of the far door, but it does not turn.
[218:54.79]Is it locked?
[218:58.35]Kick the door down.
[219:00.63]One good kick and the door flies open.
[219:05.84]Look at the door.
[219:06.42]The door is heavy wood, tightly joined, and yet from between its planks a thick oil seems to ooze.
[219:12.44]The far door opens into a staircase heading downwards.
[219:17.36]Let's go.
[219:20.30]You step onto the top step of a flight of stairs that runs down the darkness below.
[219:26.24]More stairs.
[219:27.29]Halfway down.
[219:29.99]The smell grows worse with every downward step you take.
[219:36.29]This is not looking good.
[219:37.22]The bottom of the steps.
[219:41.24]The smell is fetid down here.
[219:43.12]What is this place?
[219:44.32]A low doorway is set in the wall.
[219:48.60]Listen at the door.
[219:50.50]Behind the door you hear shuffling and snuffling and scraping.
[219:55.09]What buried horrors lie beyond the door?
[220:03.39]Low door.
[220:06.92]Oh, goodness.
[220:09.12]You stride into the underground room to be stopped short by a chaotic scene.
[220:14.03]Inside the cramped chamber are more than a dozen grotesque creatures clamoring all over each other.
[220:26.65]Look at this fucking weirdo.
[220:30.01]It's just a head with two feet on his neck.
[220:41.59]What else is in this picture?
[220:44.79]This is crazy.
[220:47.45]Look at the creatures.
[220:49.49]The creatures resemble goblins in the way a wax puddle resembles a candlestick.
[220:54.53]All have been cursed and stunted with horrendous growths and changes.
[220:59.59]One has a large bulbous head, puffy like a sack of potatoes.
[221:04.19]Another has hands growing all over its torso, while a third seems to lack any bones at all and flops and rolls around the room.
[221:13.89]Hey, guys!
[221:15.53]You step forward to greet one of the creatures.
[221:17.23]You notice her tongue is snaking out of her mouth and coils twice around her neck.
[221:23.65]Who are you, she asks.
[221:27.97]Are you looking for the vault?
[221:31.30]That's not how I... I'm not doing that right.
[221:35.40]What's the vault?
[221:37.18]You must be looking for the vault, the mutant answers, rolling her head in its sockets.
[221:44.25]No one comes down here.
[221:47.23]The other mutants lumber towards you, a few more circle around as though trying to approach you sideways.
[221:54.42]I mean you no harm.
[221:56.66]The mutant seems taken aback, her tongue is retreated at least.
[222:00.52]You lie.
[222:04.77]What happened to you?
[222:06.97]The long-tongued goblin is silent.
[222:09.59]Another steps forward, one with small mouths in place of eyes.
[222:13.70]All three mouths speak at once with jarring harmony.
[222:18.34]Harmony.
[222:21.95]Hold on, give me one second.
[222:22.93]I will be right back.
[222:24.47]Give me a minute.
[222:25.43]Give me one minute.
[222:26.27]I swear to God, give me one minute.
[224:13.90]Okay, let's read this again.
[224:16.24]So it says... Sorry about that, guys.
[224:20.03]What happened to you?
[224:20.93]The long-tongued goblin is silent.
[224:23.39]Another steps forward, one with small mouths in place of eyes.
[224:26.13]All three mouths speak at once with jarring harmony.
[224:30.95]That's so fucking loud!
[224:33.55]Oh my god, I'm so sorry!
[224:37.03]Hold on, let me do this again.
[224:38.51]Hold on a second.
[224:39.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[224:40.78]Okay, here we go, here we go.
[224:42.84]We exist at the Archmage's pleasure.
[224:46.78]We are her little toys.
[224:48.91]They say he searches for the secrets of life itself.
[224:55.33]You are disgusting!
[224:56.80]Can I pass?
[225:06.79]that up so bad.
[225:10.83]Too quiet.
[225:13.01]I'll do it again.
[225:13.59]It was too loud that it was too quiet.
[225:22.28]There, here it is.
[225:23.40]We exist at the Archmage's pleasure.
[225:27.44]We are her little toys.
[225:29.54]They say he searches for the secrets of life itself.
[225:35.99]Okay.
[225:36.99]Can I go?
[225:37.43]Bye.
[225:37.67]Oh, shit.
[225:39.09]Hold on.
[225:39.39]Give me a minute.
[226:30.29]Okay, so let's go through this again.
[226:34.49]Okay.
[226:36.54]So, may I pass through?
[226:38.80]And explore the vaults?
[226:44.44]Yes, I want to explore the vaults.
[226:46.96]Thank you for considering.
[226:48.12]The vaults are guarded, guarded by traps and beasts.
[226:53.75]And the word, adds the long-tongued one,
[227:03.57]Uh, what is... Offer them something.
[227:08.01]You open your pouch, showing them your hefty supply of gold, but the long-ton goblin laughs.
[227:14.99]Gold?
[227:15.91]Can you eat gold?
[227:17.45]Does it help you to walk or smile or laugh?
[227:27.78]Then what do you want?
[227:31.72]Nothing you can give.
[227:32.68]You cannot remake what has been made.
[227:36.46]What is the word for the vaults?
[227:39.36]To your surprise, the long-tongued goblin replies, but it is a messy slur of symbols and you cannot make it out.
[227:46.66]The other mutants nod vigorously, however.
[227:50.32]Tell me again.
[227:53.38]Hold on, I gotta get this.
[227:54.78]Hold on one second.
[227:55.92]I gotta do the spell.
[227:59.84]One second.
[229:05.99]Alright, what's the password?
[229:06.99]What's the password?
[229:08.67]Tell me again the password.
[229:10.21]I couldn't make that out the first time.
[229:11.57]Okay.
[229:16.49]Got it.
[229:17.91]Do it one more time.
[229:19.09]I couldn't... I didn't get that.
[229:23.77]You got one more.
[229:25.29]Just gonna do a little slower.
[229:31.50]Okay, thank you for your time guys.
[229:33.18]I appreciate that if you could Be so kind as to I'm gonna have to threaten them God what the fuck am I even doing?
[229:48.83]I've lost all control.
[229:51.81]I Could do me just a quick favor.
[229:53.07]Can you do that one more time for me?
[229:56.99]But like say it a little bit slower
[230:01.86]No, fuck.
[230:02.38]Hold on.
[230:02.84]Wait a minute.
[230:03.20]Wait.
[230:03.38]No, no, no.
[230:03.78]Go back.
[230:04.10]I fucked it up.
[230:07.54]I have fucked it up.
[230:08.94]There we go.
[230:09.86]Do it a little bit slower for me, please.
[230:13.90]Okay, I'm getting the fuck out of this.
[230:19.11]Bye.
[230:19.43]I'm sorry.
[230:23.95]I'm sorry.
[230:25.57]Threaten them.
[230:27.67]What the hell is this?
[230:29.10]Back away or I'll be forced to act.
[230:32.34]The creatures pause, eyeing your weapon warily.
[230:35.44]Then one with the coiling tongue balls her fists.
[230:40.38]We have weapons too, she answers coldly.
[230:44.26]As she speaks, a hulking mutant lowers himself from a sticky pool on the ceiling.
[230:49.21]His body is extremely skinny, but his arms are like tree trunks and he advances with ground-shaking steps.
[230:55.67]Take a hostage!
[230:57.31]You grab the nearest mutant by the neck and press the point of your weapon against his throat.
[231:00.77]The room is still.
[231:01.53]The champion pauses.
[231:03.85]Let her go, hisses the mutant.
[231:09.85]Why does everything have to go to shit?
[231:14.99]Call off the attack.
[231:17.78]The mutant shakes her head.
[231:19.64]I was giving you advice!
[231:22.04]The mutant in your arms begins to weep with terror.
[231:25.12]Where his tears fall on your arm, they burn like acid.
[231:28.40]Your flesh begins to sizzle and smoke.
[231:31.19]Fucking hold on!
[231:32.33]You keep a tight grip, and the blubbering mutant's acid tears continue to burn.
[231:37.65]You circle around the crowd using him as a shield.
[231:40.93]The champion bellows but keeps his distance.
[231:43.77]Head for the far door.
[231:45.76]You reach the door and finally push away the crying mutant who stumbles into the crowd.
[231:51.00]But tugging at the door, you find it does not open.
[231:52.90]The champion advances.
[231:54.58]The mutant knocks your blade aside with his club and stomps closer.
[231:58.41]You'll have to use your fists.
[232:01.57]Oh, shit.
[232:02.43]Fall blast, right?
[232:04.49]Got him.
[232:06.05]That was a big punch right to his face.
[232:09.03]The mutant champion raises its spike club into the air and you punch him directly in his face.
[232:14.14]I need to... Oh, boy.
[232:16.82]How much... He doesn't have very much stamina, does he?
[232:20.50]That was a mistake.
[232:21.45]It's okay.
[232:23.51]Steps backwards across the slippery chamber, putting space between you.
[232:26.25]He's coming in.
[232:26.69]No, I wouldn't be able to do it anyways.
[232:29.01]It's fine.
[232:31.85]You dodge the blow as it passes, and the thing frowns stupidly in annoyance.
[232:38.78]Shit.
[232:38.90]I thought he was going to come with, like, a three.
[232:40.10]Okay.
[232:43.02]Okay.
[232:43.50]The Mutant Champion drops into a defensive crouch, moving with more speed than you expect.
[232:48.05]Can I cut him out?
[232:48.55]No, block it.
[232:49.75]Okay.
[232:50.65]Alright.
[232:51.71]Good to go.
[232:55.05]The Mutant Champion peers at you in return from under its heavy brawl.
[232:58.73]Block.
[232:59.79]Yep.
[233:01.61]Back up to full stamina, full blast him.
[233:03.87]It beats its huge chest and roars.
[233:06.11]Full blast.
[233:08.15]Got him.
[233:11.39]So much for that expensive sword, I know, right?
[233:13.31]Really.
[233:15.05]It moves away towards the other corner.
[233:16.65]I can do another one here.
[233:18.39]Oh, fuck!
[233:19.11]Okay, it's holding back now.
[233:24.87]Block.
[233:26.15]Shit, I could've overpowered that.
[233:27.21]It's okay.
[233:29.55]Mutant Champion tries a weak punch, but you duck out of its way.
[233:31.74]6.0.
[233:33.20]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[233:37.86]He deflects my fist.
[233:40.12]He's gonna block here.
[233:42.20]Yep.
[233:46.12]The crowd are spurring on the champion.
[233:48.04]Shaking its stupid head, it picks itself up once more.
[233:49.74]Yeah, he's coming in hard here.
[233:50.96]Okay, now I can just do like a 2.6.
[233:56.56]And then we're going full blast and we're going to kill him.
[233:59.50]Champion pauses to grunt its fellow kind.
[234:01.62]6.7.
[234:02.22]You lose.
[234:03.36]I beat you with my bare hands.
[234:08.42]Bare handed this guy.
[234:11.14]Thank you, Sergeant Chickenwing, for 300 bits.
[234:13.90]Uh, thanks for making me laugh.
[234:16.84]I'm glad you thought that was funny.
[234:18.96]Thanks, Kiki, for the sub, and thank you to Sturry for the sub as well.
[234:23.42]Megalomaniacal Halid, thanks for 333 bits.
[234:25.57]Good joke, Jerma.
[234:26.21]Your dedication to silly voices is staggering and inspiring.
[234:29.45]I think I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[234:34.09]Brilliant boxing.
[234:37.73]The other mutants back away as you snatch up your cutlass once more.
[234:41.39]The long-tongued goblin rubs her hands with worry.
[234:44.37]Who will protect us now?
[234:47.38]What will we do without a champion?
[234:50.24]They cluster around each other, fearing that you will turn on them next.
[234:58.54]Leave this place, you reply passionately.
[235:01.98]Do not live in hiding.
[235:03.56]Rise up.
[235:05.06]But the mutants click their tongues and shake their heads.
[235:08.07]No, no, no, we don't like the light.
[235:11.73]Don't like it at all.
[235:15.14]You leave them to their fretting.
[235:20.58]Okay.
[235:21.78]Cross the room, bottom of the stairs.
[235:24.10]Hold on, let me take a look at that clue.
[235:27.80]Manpinghide, the inner vault word, requires a secret word.
[235:33.29]What the hell was it called?
[235:35.37]The Archmage may be dead.
[235:36.49]What the fuck was it?
[235:38.15]Oh, I gotta listen to my sound clip back.
[235:40.37]I don't remember what the sound was.
[235:44.79]Let's keep going.
[235:46.75]Trevor the Bully?
[235:51.27]Slamming the door behind you, you jog down a short hallway.
[235:54.47]The walls echo with the sound of the mutants pounding at the door, but it does not open.
[235:59.75]At the far end of the corridor is another door.
[236:02.52]Listen at the door.
[236:04.16]You press your ear to the door but hear nothing through the wood, but you do catch the faintest smell of grease.
[236:10.10]The door is unlocked.
[236:10.82]It swings smoothly open on well-oiled hinges.
[236:14.86]The oily room.
[236:16.52]Okay.
[236:19.98]You enter the room, which is even darker than the mutant's chamber.
[236:22.64]The corners are lost, and there's nothing of the far wall behind the faint outline of a doorway.
[236:28.24]A faint, oily smell hangs in the room.
[236:32.86]Call out.
[236:34.43]There's no response.
[236:35.57]Step forward.
[236:37.67]You step forward another pace in, letting your eyes adjust.
[236:41.37]The floor is slightly slippery, as if someone had spilled fat everywhere.
[236:46.15]In the far corner, a dark shape looms.
[236:50.08]You take another step into the room and kick something that rattles away across the ground.
[236:54.60]Glass?
[236:57.18]Find it.
[236:59.43]You reach down for the object, but your fingers find nothing.
[237:02.76]Feeling across the slick ground, your palms become thick with oil.
[237:06.86]From nearby, you hear a sound, a faint wheezing of sorts.
[237:10.62]It seems to crawl along the walls.
[237:14.94]You strain your ears and make out a fleshy scraping behind you.
[237:21.43]There is a pause, the wheezing comes again, and then the scraping again.
[237:25.73]Sounds like a haunch of meat being dragged across the tiled floor.
[237:30.04]Swing violently.
[237:32.40]You turn with a wild swing with your cutlass meets only ear.
[237:38.38]Walk forward.
[237:40.79]You walk forward, keeping your cutlass in front.
[237:42.75]The scraping dies down, but the wheezing remains.
[237:45.49]Something crunches underfoot.
[237:47.39]The glass object.
[237:49.01]A vial or a glass box, perhaps it is now crushed.
[237:52.90]Look through the glass.
[237:54.68]You feel through the shards, careful not to cut yourself, until your fingers find something metal.
[237:59.83]It is a small key.
[238:01.83]You pocket the key and your hand brushes something else.
[238:05.51]Lash out.
[238:08.63]Whoa.
[238:10.04]It's like snuffleupagus.
[238:12.51]You swing up with your sword and hit something solid and fleshy.
[238:15.73]You hear a wail of pain.
[238:17.85]Blood mixes with oil as the creature's shoulder bleeds, yet it still doesn't attack.
[238:23.50]In fact, as it lumbers into the light, it gestures with its trunk and holds a hand up to its ear.
[238:30.40]It is a Mukalictic, a foul creature of the Archmage.
[238:34.13]But what does it want?
[238:42.50]I'm gonna yap this motherfucker.
[238:44.58]We're gonna yap this guy.
[238:49.79]Tell... I could... No more zapping.
[238:53.37]We're gonna read his mind.
[238:54.61]Tell.
[238:56.21]Let's see what he wants.
[239:00.06]Drawing the skullcap from your pack, you cast the spell.
[239:02.14]The thoughts of the creature come through clearly.
[239:04.69]It wants desperately to talk to you.
[239:07.09]To talk to anyone.
[239:08.49]Just to be heard.
[239:09.69]It has things to say that are never heard.
[239:12.07]It wants to be heard.
[239:13.73]The thoughts go on and on.
[239:14.71]You remove the skullcap and a blessed silence descends upon your mind.
[239:20.63]Then we're going to listen to it.
[239:23.59]You lean in to hear the creature's message.
[239:26.05]It inches near.
[239:28.70]It exhales.
[239:31.69]Before you can react, it exhales a cloud of poison breath and- What?
[239:37.69]What the fuck?
[239:42.75]A cloud of poison breath envelops you.
[239:45.31]You've been poisoned by a mucolytic.
[239:51.72]No, that's fucking bullshit.
[239:54.64]He just wanted to talk to me.
[239:55.86]I read his mind.
[239:56.70]Oh my god.
[240:03.10]Fucking bullshit.
[240:05.36]I even read his damn mind.
[240:06.66]He didn't say anything in there about breathing poison down my throat.
[240:19.70]Down to 17.
[240:20.10]God damn it.
[240:24.18]What a pain in the ass.
[240:28.34]That's what happens when you don't zap.
[240:29.50]That's, you know, you know, you got, that's true.
[240:32.60]That is true.
[240:36.10]Into the square.
[240:39.12]Morning breath.
[240:43.40]Back this way.
[240:44.14]I'm not going in there again.
[240:46.92]Make a move.
[240:47.40]I have five damn stamina.
[240:50.87]This is such a fucking nightmare.
[240:53.13]Down the alley.
[240:57.28]You make your way along the alleyway.
[240:58.65]Helene leads off.
[240:59.57]The moon climbs the sky, filling the world with thin silver light.
[241:03.47]Make a move.
[241:03.83]I need to find somewhere to sleep.
[241:07.07]Tavern.
[241:07.71]Perfect.
[241:08.31]Tavern.
[241:13.07]A sign hangs outside the tavern door.
[241:14.65]This is the bony hand.
[241:18.37]Enter.
[241:21.28]To enter the tavern, you are forced to duck under the low doorframe.
[241:24.20]The whole building seems to have sunk at least a foot into the ground, either from age, neglect, or both.
[241:29.26]You're probably safe from the guard patrols in here.
[241:32.35]Look around.
[241:35.55]Are you done being a self-righteous biab about zapping people now?
[241:38.15]That thing wasn't even a person.
[241:41.45]Yeah, I guess you're right.
[241:43.75]And I also thank you to smiteisbetterthanlol.
[241:47.48]Welcome, thanks for your subscription.
[241:50.94]Okay, most of the crowd are merchants or other visitors to Mampang.
[241:53.80]You see a good number of messengers and clerks returning from far-flung eastern areas of the Archmage's growing kingdom.
[242:00.81]The crown has extended its grip across a wide area, much of it normally occupied by proud cultures who would fight back if it were not for the artifact's controlling powers.
[242:11.25]Now it takes nearly as many bureaucrats as soldiers to maintain it all.
[242:17.32]Explore.
[242:17.68]There are several tables, both occupied and empty, and a little space at the bar.
[242:23.75]Let me take a look here.
[242:27.73]Alright, we're going to... We are going to do the storyline, whatever it is, in here.
[242:34.75]And then I'm probably going to call it for the night.
[242:38.30]My throat's getting a little parched here.
[242:40.86]And I can feel my nose already filling up again.
[242:43.58]So... We'll do what's in this area here.
[242:48.33]And...
[242:49.90]Funnily enough, this is taking longer than I thought it was going to be, so there's a lot more left to explore.
[242:54.10]All this shit over here, all this shit over here, this whole fortress.
[242:57.36]There's a lot to do, so we're not quite done with sorcery.
[243:01.73]Not yet.
[243:04.45]Go grab some tea.
[243:06.27]No, no tea's going to fix me.
[243:09.39]I need a new nose.
[243:12.51]Oh, who called that you wouldn't finish tonight?
[243:15.48]I guess I just didn't take into consideration the fact that you kind of have to go back in time and start over again from the middle point of the game.
[243:27.80]But, I mean, I figured it was going to be... At least we'll see a lot of this shit here.
[243:32.58]Two more streams?
[243:33.21]I don't think so.
[243:35.13]We've already been down here and down here and up here.
[243:38.01]I think one, maybe two will do it.
[243:40.69]I don't know.
[243:41.07]It depends on how much more there is.
[243:44.45]Am I going to stream this next Tuesday?
[243:46.61]I will probably stream this on Thursday.
[243:52.30]Actually, no, maybe not.
[243:53.22]We'll see.
[243:53.54]Let's put it this way.
[243:55.98]If I don't have a plan, if I don't have a plan on Tuesday, or if I don't stream again, I might throw in an off-schedule stream this weekend or on Monday or something.
[244:06.76]Maybe we'll play this again.
[244:09.21]I haven't decided yet.
[244:15.19]Yeah, if this game were bad, that'd be a horrible mechanic, but sorcery is great, so it gets a pass.
[244:22.53]Yeah, I love this game.
[244:24.33]This whole series has just been fun.
[244:27.35]Alright, let's... There's a dice table here.
[244:32.24]The bar.
[244:34.66]Let's go to the bar.
[244:38.44]I'll probably turn it on Saturday.
[244:39.58]It depends on what I do.
[244:40.82]We'll see.
[244:41.66]I definitely will do an off-schedule stream.
[244:45.26]Sombra comes out, plays some Overwatch.
[244:46.46]Is she coming out on the PTR, or is she coming out in full?
[244:51.66]I don't know.
[244:54.77]The sides of Mampang are some of the best parts of Part 4.
[244:58.37]Yeah, there's a lot left to see, so... Alright, you fight your way to the bar, but the bartender ignores you.
[245:05.51]Oh, shit, I'm wearing, like, the monk's clothes.
[245:09.82]Attract his attention.
[245:12.18]He frowns at you.
[245:13.72]We don't serve monks too much false money.
[245:17.20]The bartender moves away.
[245:18.89]Hey, but look, uh, fuck you.
[245:23.09]Should I just take the damn thing off?
[245:26.85]No, let's go empty table.
[245:32.20]Oh, you find a corner table and sit down.
[245:33.94]Look at the other drinkers.
[245:36.27]You survey the room, marveling at how such a jolly place exists in Mampang.
[245:40.18]The rest does you well, and you feel a little stronger for it.
[245:44.04]A stranger walks up to your table, their face completely obscured by a plain yellow cloth.
[245:49.28]May I sit?
[245:49.88]Oh, hold on.
[245:52.42]Give me a second.
[245:58.14]May I sit?
[245:59.64]They ask, voice muffled.
[246:02.14]Please, go ahead.
[246:04.08]Gesturing to the seat, you say please.
[246:06.36]The stranger bows a fraction, then sits.
[246:09.60]My thanks.
[246:10.92]It's been a tiring journey.
[246:12.64]I move very slowly.
[246:14.25]You understand?
[246:17.69]Why is that?
[246:19.59]I am very old.
[246:21.43]I would have died a hundred years ago if the sun serpent's light were not keeping me alive.
[246:26.47]He makes a sign with his hand, moving his fingers in a coiling fashion.
[246:32.98]A most powerful goddess, I am certain.
[246:35.78]The priest nods.
[246:38.32]Why is your face covered?
[246:40.64]So I'm not blinded by the glory of the Sun Serpent.
[246:43.80]To gaze upon its light would be too much for the eyes of a mere mortal.
[246:49.92]You know where a man-pang, well... It is a tissue.
[246:54.66]How the fuck did you know that?
[246:55.50]I don't know how you could get that.
[246:59.33]Changing the subject away.
[247:00.81]Indeed.
[247:02.11]I have shown the goddess light into every corner of this place.
[247:07.28]Perhaps you can help me.
[247:09.08]I need to find a way inside the tower.
[247:11.55]The serpent priest hisses a thin laugh.
[247:18.17]No one enters the tower but the accursed bird men.
[247:22.47]Well, this was most edifying.
[247:27.15]Goodbye.
[247:29.03]But you are done resting.
[247:29.91]You get to your feet once more.
[247:33.19]Go talk.
[247:36.07]Oh, yeah.
[247:37.27]You walk over to a group of black elves clustered around a table.
[247:40.31]Empty cups are scattered on the floor around them, and a dagger sticks out of the table.
[247:44.67]They're dressed in armor, though they seem to be relaxed.
[247:47.75]Mercenaries.
[247:50.02]One points at you as you pass.
[247:52.45]Brother, you are lost.
[247:54.80]What's a godly type like you doing in a drinking hole like this?
[247:59.32]He looks like something dragged up from the river.
[248:03.29]I said that.
[248:03.89]It was me.
[248:04.51]He looks like something dragged up from the river.
[248:09.17]The others laugh at your expense.
[248:48.09]The others laugh at your expense.
[248:49.67]Fucking idiot.
[248:54.39]I laugh along.
[248:57.29]The black elf continues to insult you.
[249:05.16]Fucking slap him.
[249:05.98]You swing out a hand and saw them blow his jaw.
[249:08.28]He staggers back and snarls and leaps forward.
[249:11.75]Raise your fist.
[249:13.79]Fall fucking blast him.
[249:14.73]Kill him.
[249:19.20]Alright, the muscles in the black elf's arm tighten.
[249:20.92]The gathered crowd murmur with interest.
[249:23.90]Oh, nice.
[249:24.44]No, good throw.
[249:25.28]Good punch.
[249:28.72]He steps back around an onlooker.
[249:30.47]He's back a little bit.
[249:31.83]I can get him with a three.
[249:36.23]And we're going to 6.5.
[249:36.97]Ooh, you took two points of damage.
[249:40.21]What are we going to do?
[249:40.93]We're going to do a 3.2.
[249:42.87]Oh, that was not smart.
[249:46.06]He faints left, banging into a table.
[249:49.63]Got him.
[249:54.61]He has to defend here.
[249:55.89]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[249:57.31]I don't care.
[250:05.89]He's coming in hard.
[250:07.31]Knew it.
[250:08.11]And this is the way we win.
[250:09.54]What a fucking display.
[250:11.56]Bash him.
[250:16.21]You launch a heavy punch for his throat, you trip the black elf and give him one final blow to the head as he lies on his back.
[250:21.79]He waves you off, admitting defeat.
[250:29.86]The elf turns over the table as he collapses, upsetting the drinks.
[250:32.12]The watching crowd are too delighted by the fight to mind.
[250:36.91]You quickly pat down the fallen elf's body and his companions make no move to stop you.
[250:41.53]You find a valuable-looking pearl ring.
[250:44.57]You leave them with a smirk.
[250:46.19]They cheer your fine fisticuffs.
[250:48.96]They cheer your...
[252:10.42]Alright, so you leave them with a smirk and they cheer you with fists in the air!
[252:17.74]No, I did it the wrong way, it was supposed to be... Whoops.
[252:27.91]It wasn't supposed to be like that.
[252:29.23]It wasn't supposed to be like Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[252:38.17]Let's go to the dice table.
[252:42.43]Do I?
[252:44.81]You see a few tables where there may be a hunched over swindle stones.
[252:49.43]You see an unkempt merchant alone at the table waiting for a game.
[252:51.95]You approach your table.
[252:53.81]Looking for a game?
[252:55.17]No, that was me.
[252:55.87]Looking for a game, you ask?
[252:57.66]I am, but I only play for money.
[252:59.50]I will play.
[253:01.90]The merchant calls for ale and she takes out her dice.
[253:04.12]The steak?
[253:05.72]Ten gold pieces.
[253:09.11]Four dice apiece.
[253:11.27]Here we go.
[253:12.05]Roll the dice.
[253:14.63]Swindles bones.
[253:17.33]Alright, we got two ones.
[253:19.92]Let's just be fucking insane and say three twos.
[253:27.90]Oh boy, you took the bait hard.
[253:29.48]Okay, that means she has to have two.
[253:37.03]I'm gonna call that.
[253:37.61]I don't think she has two.
[253:43.45]Thank you very much.
[253:44.77]I will take the first round.
[253:52.17]What a funny guy.
[253:54.71]Thank you, Mr. Sandman, for this ten bucks.
[253:59.52]Oh, you should watch out.
[254:00.94]I was taught by the monks of Effie.
[254:02.42]Oh, I am a monk of Effie.
[254:03.98]Dummy.
[254:04.28]Alright, one, three.
[254:07.24]I have one three.
[254:07.90]Let's go ahead and say two threes.
[254:12.48]I hope she says three.
[254:13.84]That means she has to have two.
[254:19.45]I'm going to call that bullshit.
[254:23.05]Fuck, she actually had two.
[254:24.03]Hold on.
[254:27.50]I'm going to keep playing, but give me a second.
[255:16.87]This one's not even fucking funny.
[255:19.27]This one sucks.
[255:20.53]Alright.
[255:21.37]I have an amazing hand here.
[255:24.99]I'm going to say one, two.
[255:28.25]I'm going to go three twos.
[255:29.39]Oh, two twos.
[255:30.03]Really?
[255:30.39]How about... She must have a two.
[255:34.07]Three twos.
[255:37.07]Call it.
[255:37.89]Do it.
[255:38.67]Four twos.
[255:43.45]Holy shit.
[255:43.99]We might both have...
[255:46.26]So she has to have two.
[255:48.06]Fuck.
[255:50.81]I think I'm in trouble here.
[255:51.59]Call it.
[255:53.81]She had... Wow!
[255:56.19]That's just not fair.
[255:57.17]That's just unlucky right there.
[255:58.65]We both had a full hand of twos.
[256:05.35]Unlucky.
[256:09.03]One three.
[256:09.61]Let's go two threes.
[256:16.00]Really get her to go three threes.
[256:17.60]Come on.
[256:18.58]Yes.
[256:20.84]Now that is just almost impossible for you to have a full hand again.
[256:23.98]No, it's... Yeah, get out of here.
[256:26.94]Roll again.
[256:30.10]Three to two.
[256:30.64]I'm going to say there are two ones.
[256:36.38]Two twos.
[256:40.60]Two... Oh, shit.
[256:47.28]Three twos.
[256:50.44]Oh, no.
[256:54.23]Oh, shit.
[256:56.03]No.
[256:57.65]I thought I won that one somehow.
[256:59.21]One.
[256:59.37]Okay, I'm going to fuck it over right now.
[257:03.19]One.
[257:04.57]Four.
[257:06.17]I have to say two.
[257:06.97]I have to pretend like I have a four.
[257:08.65]Two fours.
[257:10.15]I got to pretend.
[257:15.89]I'll lose.
[257:17.21]I lost.
[257:17.53]Yeah, I lost.
[257:18.59]That was fucking good.
[257:25.50]It wasn't long enough.
[257:32.62]God damn it.
[257:36.39]It was only like two people saying poop.
[257:38.77]Alright, I'm out of here.
[257:39.67]The stream's over.
[257:45.83]Thank God.
[257:47.20]I only lost 10 gold.
[257:48.06]It's not a big deal.
[257:48.68]I'm loaded.
[257:49.24]I'm still up on the casino.
[257:50.40]Don't worry.
[257:54.06]This guy sucks.
[257:58.18]I had one prepared for win and one prepared for lose.
[258:05.08]I've done everything I can do in the bar.
[258:14.41]Thank you to Neverhoodlum for your five months.
[258:19.45]Some zap fan art.
[258:22.33]Thanks for the funny stream.
[258:23.21]Well, thank you, Cyrus.
[258:24.01]I appreciate the kind words.
[258:28.54]Alright, that was fun.
[258:30.56]We have not even come close to completing Sorcery.
[258:32.40]I thought we were going to come close, but no, we still probably got at least another stream or two for it.
[258:37.51]I did have 120 gold, but I bought a shitload of stuff.
[258:45.19]Thank you, everyone, for watching.
[258:46.29]That's gonna be it.
[258:47.35]Much appreciation.
[258:48.03]Show us the win one, please.
[258:50.41]It was here.
[258:51.53]Here.
[259:00.02]Right here.
[259:01.48]You did it!
[259:03.98]You did it!
[259:04.40]That's it.
[259:05.82]You did it!
[259:08.46]You did it!
[259:21.84]You did it I'm so oh my god.
[259:28.11]That's so fucking loud.
[259:29.41]I'm so sorry I'm so sorry.
[259:35.23]I'm fucking so sorry guys.
[259:37.56]I did not realize it was as loud as it was
[259:42.55]Oh, my God.
[259:44.03]I do.
[259:47.79]Have a good night, guys.
[259:49.57]Sorry for just mashing sounds into your ear.
[259:54.70]Good night.
[259:55.14]Good luck.
[259:56.66]Thanks for sticking around.
[259:57.70]We'll be live at the very least next week on Tuesday.
[260:01.50]7 o'clock, but I probably will do another stream.
[260:06.22]My ears.
[260:07.30]I'm so fucking sorry.
[260:08.46]I hate doing that to people.
[260:12.78]Sub sound?
[260:13.82]You want that to be the sub?
[260:15.38]That would be terrible.
[260:18.28]You did it!
[260:21.88]You need a new nose.
[260:22.58]I need new ears.
[260:23.24]I'm fucking terribly sorry.
[260:26.24]Good night, guys.
[260:27.77]We'll talk to you guys at some point soon in the future.
[260:30.99]Again, like I said, we'll either be live on Tuesday or we'll be live on somewhere over the weekend, maybe.
[260:36.73]Depends on how I feel.
[260:38.91]Good night.
[260:39.47]Much love.
[260:40.65]Take care, everybody.
[260:42.25]Have a good rest of your night.
[262:29.40]And goodbye, love.
