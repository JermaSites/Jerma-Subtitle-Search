[01:04.24]What's up?
[01:05.40]It's not dead?
[01:10.34]No.
[01:11.02]No, I'm here.
[01:14.18]I'm very much here.
[01:18.07]You have returned.
[01:22.45]Well, I told you.
[01:24.19]Every so often we were going to do a stream.
[01:26.53]And that was going to be various different things.
[01:28.33]Sometimes it might be a mac and cheese review stream.
[01:30.41]Sometimes it might be a
[01:33.28]Elden Ring hype stream.
[01:37.56]We didn't talk about that, did we?
[01:44.59]Yeah, who cares?
[01:45.65]Elden Ring DLC is coming out.
[01:46.69]It's going to be fun.
[01:49.19]What more do you need me to say?
[01:50.57]Right.
[01:51.53]We're going to talk about that one for a little while.
[01:55.57]But today...
[01:58.12]I did tell you I was going to do something very, very special.
[02:02.22]And by very special, I mean... Probably will get a lot of you to leave.
[02:06.68]Permanently.
[02:08.92]But, you know, whatever.
[02:09.70]It's okay.
[02:11.77]Can you hear?
[02:12.15]Can you hear what's on the table here?
[02:18.05]This piece is fucked up.
[02:19.97]Oh, no, it's not.
[02:20.65]There we go.
[02:22.91]I got a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle.
[02:24.81]I'm going to chill and do it.
[02:26.91]Are you ready?
[02:30.10]What's up?
[02:31.84]I don't have tea.
[02:32.54]I'm sorry.
[02:33.86]I have a, uh... I have a spiced Coke.
[02:40.85]Which is weird.
[02:42.11]Why are you wearing the gloves?
[02:43.09]Yeah, I look like I'm fucking presenting meat.
[02:47.45]Oh, so yeah, when you cut it down, look, you've got to go against the grain here.
[02:50.49]Look at the juices.
[02:51.55]And look at the juices.
[02:54.00]Well, I don't want to mess it up.
[02:55.58]I don't want to mess anything up.
[02:59.04]I had to wear the chef gloves.
[03:00.24]I don't know.
[03:00.84]I thought it would be funny.
[03:04.40]You're missing pieces?
[03:06.41]How did you know that yet?
[03:08.69]You don't even know what the puzzle... You don't even know what we're doing.
[03:12.41]I was going to have you guys pick the puzzle, but I was like, you know what?
[03:15.99]Nah, we got to do this one for a very specific reason.
[03:19.24]Are you ready?
[03:20.86]Here is the puzzle we're doing tonight.
[03:25.18]It's called Imaginary Dragons.
[03:29.87]And let me go ahead and read you.
[03:31.21]I want to read you the back.
[03:34.79]By the way, I did not know this when this was purchased.
[03:37.71]I had no idea.
[03:39.83]Brandish your swords and take up your shields, for the mighty battle is about to begin.
[03:44.03]Fly into the mountains of Europe, with Eric on the wings of a dragon in all shapes, colors, and sizes.
[03:51.00]See if you can defend your castle with allied dragons like Aspinentia, Invidia, and Solntyr, against evil dragon lords like Superbia, Ira, and Avaritia.
[04:08.02]One of Eric's favorite bands, Imagine Dragons, inspired this painting.
[04:13.66]And if you study it, you'll see his tribute to them in loose form.
[04:19.47]I did not fucking know that when this was purchased.
[04:22.65]It was just a cool looking dragon puzzle.
[04:24.17]And I was like, you know what?
[04:24.75]I'll do it.
[04:25.03]But now we have to do this.
[04:26.65]This is the Imagine Dragons puzzle.
[04:31.03]Okay.
[04:32.97]So here we go.
[04:33.83]How long do you think it's going to take me to do this?
[04:41.14]Should we get some bets going?
[04:42.60]Because I feel like it could take me all night.
[04:46.28]I did flip the pieces already, though.
[04:48.04]I did flip them preemptively.
[04:51.91]Four hours?
[04:52.39]Okay.
[04:55.95]Two hours?
[04:58.99]I'm thinking this could be a one hour.
[05:05.05]You're going to give up in 50 minutes?
[05:08.00]Alright.
[05:08.98]Mods, can we get a poll?
[05:11.91]Give up within an hour.
[05:16.01]Two hours.
[05:18.09]And then four hours.
[05:23.00]Alright, I'm going to show you how I do puzzles.
[05:27.28]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[05:38.02]Hold on.
[05:43.59]I'm so glad I stopped there very quickly because if you oh I gotta get a few pieces I think only one dropped got it okay alright what do you guys do puzzles do you break them up into color because here's what I'm thinking right check this out why the gloves I'm keep I was only gonna wear them for 10 minutes I'm keeping them on the whole day alright I'm thinking that I start down here
[06:14.50]This orange and red dragon down here.
[06:17.26]So we separate the pieces.
[06:19.77]So I'm only looking for this dragon down here.
[06:24.05]Imagine that.
[06:26.71]Alright, I see some red here.
[06:28.11]And don't fucking tell me that my quadrants aren't correct.
[06:37.55]looks pretty good right this looks like it's I'm gonna do this okay and it's down the lower right let me go ahead and do it down here we are just separating pieces right now I really do I need to like have a stake in front of me like I'm not opening magic the gathering cards why I don't know I I just thought it was funny I'm keeping them okay this one over here
[07:03.88]I know a lot of people do edges first.
[07:06.70]We don't do that here.
[07:08.88]We go color.
[07:10.80]Red.
[07:12.39]Yellow.
[07:13.23]Blue.
[07:14.15]Orange.
[07:15.33]Separate the colors.
[07:16.07]This is going to take me four hours.
[07:18.15]This is going to take me four hours.
[07:22.59]Can you guys see over here?
[07:24.75]Let's actually do it.
[07:25.49]I'll work like this.
[07:27.09]You can better see what's going on here.
[07:31.06]See?
[07:32.44]Take a look.
[07:33.87]I think I... I think we got our first connection.
[07:41.05]Who cares?
[07:48.25]Wowee!
[07:49.35]We got our first connection, guys.
[07:52.19]I should stop after every time I make a connection and spend like 10 minutes talking to you guys.
[08:01.26]Okay.
[08:02.22]What do we got here?
[08:05.03]Looks like it could fit.
[08:06.01]I still want to separate the colors.
[08:08.50]Hold on.
[08:09.04]We might have our first connection.
[08:10.94]Hey!
[08:13.86]First connection of the evening.
[08:17.58]That... Whoa!
[08:20.52]I'm like sticking to the pieces.
[08:24.94]Alright, I'm done.
[08:25.88]Fuck this.
[08:29.64]No, that doesn't go here.
[08:32.12]I hope I have enough space.
[08:34.34]Because this is kind of a big puzzle.
[08:39.98]He's got sticky hands.
[08:41.01]I mean, it's just kind of coming through here.
[08:42.63]Alright, so how about this one?
[08:45.93]Don't do anything but separate the colors.
[08:48.01]But you're doing it at home, too.
[08:48.97]You're doing it at home, so you know.
[08:51.39]We're all doing the Imagine Dragons puzzle.
[08:59.19]I can't grab it.
[08:59.97]My fingernail's not long enough.
[09:03.04]There we go.
[09:03.58]I'm going to do it like a claw machine.
[09:06.02]Okay.
[09:11.70]Where does this one go?
[09:13.38]Oh, that's one of the knights.
[09:14.70]Hey, look.
[09:18.26]Down here?
[09:19.78]That's one of the knights.
[09:22.04]So that does actually come down here.
[09:23.44]So let's move these over here.
[09:26.60]Anything that's not red, go away.
[09:30.57]So let's do this.
[09:33.58]Oh, this is red here.
[09:34.46]Is that his face?
[09:35.80]I don't think so.
[09:39.23]No, that's the other dragon over there.
[09:43.47]I really think I could do this in two hours.
[09:44.69]That one's orange.
[09:47.37]No, this is red.
[09:48.01]This is red.
[09:48.41]This is a red book.
[09:49.43]It's going to take you like a thousand years.
[09:53.24]No, it won't.
[09:53.80]I'll be fine.
[09:54.84]This guy right here.
[09:56.92]See the face?
[09:58.38]I'm trying to get this one over.
[10:00.14]Wait a minute.
[10:01.40]Yeah, that's correct.
[10:06.76]I don't know why I feel like the Swedish chef whenever these are on.
[10:09.34]Because you know what I'm talking about by that?
[10:11.36]Yeah, so what we got to do here, guys, is we need to make sure we do this.
[10:16.17]I'm going to fucking lose pieces if I'm not careful.
[10:17.79]You know what I'm talking about?
[10:20.39]Like the Muffet hands?
[10:21.51]Like the puppetry hands where a real guy's hands are right here?
[10:25.57]That's what it feels like.
[10:27.54]So, and it's always very over-exaggerated.
[10:30.49]And you can't really see the hands, so it ends up looking like this.
[10:33.65]Look at the top right camera.
[10:35.67]It's like, okay, so I am looking for the red pieces.
[10:41.91]That's what I want.
[10:44.60]Gotta over-exaggerate.
[10:53.72]Drink is not on the coaster?
[10:58.33]Not this expensive fucking wood.
[11:00.27]This table's not expensive.
[11:04.55]Okay, stop distracting me.
[11:05.87]I have to put my pieces together.
[11:09.90]This one is orange.
[11:10.94]Can you see?
[11:11.68]Take a look.
[11:12.98]Once you get one thing done, then you can just keep fucking rolling.
[11:17.10]Okay.
[11:22.85]Okay.
[11:27.25]I'm sweating through these.
[11:29.49]Just in case you wanted to know.
[11:31.21]I know the theory is you do the edges first, but... I want to do this dragon first.
[11:37.70]Okay.
[11:41.00]I think I can start making pieces here.
[11:42.84]Go like this.
[11:43.30]Move this out of the way.
[11:46.11]I'm going to have one missing piece, and it's going to be from the very beginning.
[11:48.07]I was an idiot.
[11:49.01]Just dropped it.
[11:51.13]Alright.
[11:51.55]So what do we have here?
[11:56.34]we need a wing I don't know if you can see the can you see the wing here sorry I just had a big breakfast okay this one goes here right does that go here oh yeah oh that's that's another one that's another one that's two pieces connected let's see they're keeping score back home
[12:28.53]I think I got the head too.
[12:29.45]Look at this.
[12:32.53]That doesn't work.
[12:34.33]Does that work?
[12:39.16]That doesn't fit.
[12:40.94]It doesn't matter.
[12:41.74]It doesn't matter if it fits.
[12:44.46]We meld the world around us.
[12:48.24]It fits.
[13:02.52]That was a joke that was made up, I want to say, a week and a half ago.
[13:06.86]I thought it was very funny.
[13:09.80]Alright, so I don't have the head here.
[13:11.76]I've been working on that one for a while.
[13:19.13]No?
[13:22.53]No?
[13:23.85]It doesn't fit either.
[13:26.37]Hold on.
[13:30.35]These gloves are coming off in 10 seconds, by the way, because I actually can't pick them up.
[13:35.30]How about this one?
[13:35.86]This one here?
[13:39.56]That's another connection.
[13:40.72]Yes, it is.
[13:43.32]Almost got a full dragon over here.
[13:49.24]Hand reveal.
[13:53.00]Well, they're on tight.
[13:57.75]I have really big fucking hands.
[14:11.76]Okay.
[14:13.48]This is much better.
[14:14.24]Let's roll the sleeves up.
[14:16.62]Okay.
[14:17.32]So.
[14:18.30]That looks good.
[14:18.98]This looks good.
[14:19.92]I should have just not cut my fingernails for like a month.
[14:23.00]That would have been so funny to reveal that.
[14:24.38]Oh well.
[14:25.54]Alright.
[14:27.46]Where are we?
[14:30.53]These should connect here.
[14:31.41]I don't think they do.
[14:34.07]No.
[14:35.87]Where the fuck did it go?
[14:45.15]How many people said I was going to give up in an hour?
[14:48.47]You were going to be so wrong.
[14:50.93]So incorrect.
[14:52.77]Okay.
[14:54.85]This is another part of the red monster.
[14:57.45]Fuck, that's not a connection.
[15:01.98]Looks like it.
[15:02.56]That's close enough.
[15:05.52]Also, another part of the red dragon.
[15:07.78]They're on opposite sides, though.
[15:09.44]Remind me, please.
[15:14.07]Alright.
[15:14.87]It's part of the claw.
[15:39.78]What the fuck?
[15:49.33]happening here?
[15:52.21]Ah!
[15:52.39]It's got to go like that.
[15:54.17]See?
[15:55.43]Like this.
[15:56.73]Because that's the left side.
[15:59.59]So now I need the body coming down here.
[16:01.37]Okay.
[16:04.01]Easy.
[16:05.67]That's cheating?
[16:09.05]You don't... You sit there and you have the puzzle in front of you the whole time.
[16:11.79]That's not... What do you mean it's cheating?
[16:14.46]Who doesn't do a jigsaw puzzle with the picture of the box sitting right there?
[16:17.84]What?
[16:26.74]That's not cheating.
[16:28.84]That's how, how would you, no, that's how you do a jigsaw puzzle.
[16:31.72]You guys are full of shit.
[16:34.22]Okay.
[16:36.26]Let me, let me get the sky up here.
[16:37.96]I think that'd be easy.
[16:39.08]All these sky pieces, those all go up here.
[16:43.61]Anything that has a cloud on it, get it up there.
[16:47.35]Because it's all, it's all the top layer, right?
[16:49.61]So let's get them all up there.
[16:52.51]I also don't want to fuck up my workspace either, so.
[16:56.65]Ah, hey!
[16:59.09]I know where that goes.
[16:59.81]Down here somewhere.
[17:02.21]Okay, there's a connection there.
[17:11.72]Looks alright so far.
[17:12.74]Okay.
[17:16.08]We're going to steamroll this once we actually get all the pieces out.
[17:23.65]Cheater, cheater, Pikmin eater.
[17:26.53]I don't play Pikmin.
[17:28.35]Didn't a new one come out?
[17:29.43]Wasn't there like a Pikmin 5 or Pikmin 4 or something?
[17:31.97]Oh, there we go.
[17:32.81]Where does that one go?
[17:37.35]I'm going to say like right here.
[17:38.31]Kind of.
[17:42.43]Really?
[17:43.87]Shit.
[17:44.13]Right there.
[17:48.79]There we go.
[17:51.54]That's good.
[17:52.64]Now, can this connect to here is the question.
[17:54.33]I think it can.
[17:55.13]Ready?
[17:55.35]Check this out.
[17:55.91]Here it is.
[17:56.25]There's going to be a big connection here.
[17:58.87]Another one.
[18:11.35]Alright.
[18:12.19]This dragon's getting close to being done.
[18:14.21]That's getting close.
[18:17.98]And that's okay.
[18:18.74]Let me actually move that over here.
[18:20.02]Because I can actually start to build the corner.
[18:23.22]And gold.
[18:24.78]Did I tell you I was drinking spiced Coke?
[18:28.64]It's really weird.
[18:29.32]It's like a raspberry Coke, but it's spiced.
[18:31.22]You guys have one of these yet?
[18:36.83]Alright.
[18:38.39]That tastes like like the end of an apple cider, but it's a Coke.
[18:47.03]No, it's good.
[18:47.59]I like it.
[18:49.25]I genuinely like it.
[18:52.65]Alright, here we go.
[18:53.55]More of these sky pieces.
[19:02.76]If you see a sky piece, definitely let me know because I'm looking for them.
[19:07.92]They're all going up here.
[19:10.96]How much time has it been?
[19:12.91]I think this is actually just the corner.
[19:14.95]I think that's just the corner of the map, like up there.
[19:18.37]I'll give you another good look.
[19:22.76]I think that's actually right... I think that's right there.
[19:29.18]What do you guys think?
[19:33.84]It's right there.
[19:34.50]What do you mean it's right there?
[19:37.90]You're talking about the orange dragon?
[19:39.82]You're talking about the red dragon.
[19:42.10]Which one?
[19:53.14]Looks like sky pieces to me.
[19:54.86]Once you have to do the castles, that's what's going to get actually kind of hard.
[19:59.55]But I can start to build it out.
[20:00.99]It's all about just slowly at your own pace.
[20:04.61]Sometimes up to six hours.
[20:06.75]Sometimes longer.
[20:07.53]Depending on the difficulty of the puzzle, you know, sometimes you take your time.
[20:11.14]And that's exactly what we're doing today.
[20:14.40]That's a castle right there.
[20:15.36]Right there, right?
[20:19.43]Nobody to rush.
[20:20.11]No, I'm not rushing at all.
[20:23.06]Anything right there?
[20:23.68]That's pretty close.
[20:28.64]Make sure I keep that in its right section, in the right quadrant.
[20:31.90]Okay.
[20:33.52]How have you guys been?
[20:35.94]I didn't even ask you.
[20:37.04]What is wrong with my voice?
[20:37.96]How have you guys been?
[20:40.26]You guys doing good?
[20:40.84]It's been like a month, a couple months.
[20:46.62]Doing good?
[20:46.94]You're going to eat soup?
[20:50.21]Oh, you know, you want me to eat soup.
[20:51.89]Oh, yeah.
[20:52.29]Alright.
[20:52.69]That sounds good.
[20:53.77]I can do that.
[20:57.41]You got a cold?
[20:57.93]Hopefully you recover from your cold very quickly.
[21:03.64]I don't think that's a sky piece.
[21:04.88]I need to find more dragon pieces.
[21:07.24]Wait, hold on.
[21:07.68]That's another one of those.
[21:12.53]Because it is red.
[21:14.02]Where's the orange?
[21:14.96]Oh, here we go.
[21:15.30]Okay.
[21:15.64]This is orange, right?
[21:16.48]That's orange dragon.
[21:18.10]It looks like it could be over here.
[21:19.08]You guys can't even see that.
[21:20.96]Can you see this?
[21:22.56]We'll get a good view of that.
[21:23.54]Because that shit's in.
[21:27.74]Okay.
[21:35.23]How do you feel about beef stew?
[21:37.79]It either sucks or it's the greatest thing in the world.
[21:40.71]It really depends on who made it.
[21:45.13]That's my opinion on beef stew.
[21:47.19]I've had beef stew that was better than anything I've ever eaten in my entire life, and I've had beef stew that I wanted to return.
[21:52.83]That's another red dragon right here.
[21:58.61]I actually might be able to put some of this together.
[22:07.36]Out of your stomach?
[22:09.06]No, no, I'm talking about the like... I'm talking about like, oh yeah, I had some of that soup.
[22:24.34]Not going to agree.
[22:25.10]I don't know about that one.
[22:27.72]That's what I'm talking about.
[22:32.06]You know the kind of beef stew that you chew longer than a piece of bubble gum?
[22:39.16]You know who you are that makes it like that.
[22:42.35]Come on.
[22:45.69]Tenderize it.
[22:46.95]For the love of God.
[22:49.37]Hey!
[22:52.85]Got a connection.
[22:56.28]Alright, don't do this yet.
[22:57.83]That's stupid.
[22:59.81]I always end up with like three or four different individual puzzles at the same time, which I don't want to do that.
[23:05.13]I want to do the dragon first.
[23:09.09]Chew your food.
[23:10.25]I do chew my food.
[23:10.91]That's what I'm saying.
[23:15.53]Find the corners.
[23:17.91]I got one up here.
[23:20.80]This table might just barely not be big enough to do this puzzle, but...
[23:26.96]It's all good.
[23:28.12]I'll make it fit.
[23:28.72]I think it should be like 16 pieces by 20.
[23:30.63]We're just going for it.
[23:33.43]Whatever.
[23:33.81]Who cares?
[23:34.21]Still looking for dragons.
[23:41.17]That's a goofy guy, don't you think?
[23:43.40]Where's that one?
[23:47.64]See this one?
[23:52.54]Cute.
[23:52.78]Cute.
[23:57.73]I'm finding a bunch of little dragons, but I'm not finding the rest of this one.
[24:01.27]Although this one's almost done.
[24:02.29]I would say I need to go up from there.
[24:05.43]So I'm looking for soldiers.
[24:07.42]I'm looking for these guys.
[24:09.92]Right there.
[24:11.38]See these guys right here?
[24:13.20]Right above the head.
[24:14.70]See the head here?
[24:15.34]It looks... Whatever, I don't care.
[24:19.43]It looks like they're right above.
[24:22.31]So I'm looking for little two soldiers that are standing with... I think they have spears?
[24:32.50]This is definitely down here.
[24:34.56]Ah.
[24:35.94]Ah, dragon.
[24:38.42]This is like a blue dragon.
[24:39.54]I think that's fine over there.
[24:43.25]More sky.
[24:43.99]Get it up there.
[24:44.57]I like this.
[24:48.59]This is kind of relaxing.
[24:52.23]Get the elves in there.
[24:52.99]Why are you doing it like this?
[24:55.85]I can see your bald spot.
[24:56.87]I'm 40.
[24:57.31]I don't care.
[24:58.55]I'm glad there's a bald spot.
[25:01.07]Do the edges first.
[25:03.08]Yeah, but the edges are like... I don't know.
[25:04.70]I feel like it's hard mode.
[25:07.11]See, I play on hardcore mode.
[25:08.61]You play on standard difficulty.
[25:14.79]But I guess I'll humor you.
[25:16.93]I'll do the top.
[25:18.10]Okay, that's probably a good idea.
[25:19.78]Let's do the top.
[25:27.32]Alright, these are all the top pieces because they're all lined like that.
[25:32.67]Not a top piece, that is.
[25:35.61]I guess they could be side pieces too.
[25:36.95]Well, this is a corner right here.
[25:39.05]Find the corners, I just found one.
[25:40.19]Okay.
[25:43.59]Boom.
[25:50.50]We mend the world around us!
[25:55.70]It fits!
[26:01.04]Okay.
[26:02.90]uh it does not fit but this one might aha there we go alright is that one that's not the top oh it's not oh there we go okay I'll get the whole top row
[26:24.29]And then that person can sit down.
[26:26.35]They're jumping up and down on their desk right now.
[26:29.51]I get it.
[26:30.01]I'm doing the top.
[26:31.91]Relax.
[26:33.41]Jesus.
[26:38.90]No.
[26:42.18]No.
[26:43.18]Not quite.
[26:43.72]Is that it?
[26:50.28]No.
[26:52.84]Fuck.
[27:02.32]Ah, hold on.
[27:04.44]That's a big one.
[27:07.18]I think these are all in the top too.
[27:08.30]Yeah, it's right in the middle.
[27:15.10]Good.
[27:15.32]Okay.
[27:16.12]Getting there.
[27:19.72]Getting there.
[27:20.32]Is that it?
[27:24.28]No.
[27:25.98]What are you saying?
[27:28.78]864p?
[27:28.86]I haven't
[27:33.82]It's so funny that I kind of pulled back from streaming before ever having a 1080p stream.
[27:39.09]Don't you guys think that's kind of funny?
[27:41.45]I'm from the old times.
[27:42.67]I'm from the old times.
[27:47.03]I never had a 1080p stream the whole time.
[27:53.09]Something about that is kind of sad, but the other end is like, whatever.
[28:06.24]You want me to throw in some music?
[28:09.90]You should eat some weed.
[28:11.40]Well, that would be a really, really bad idea.
[28:14.18]Because if I were to have some marijuana right now, I think I would end up going like this.
[28:27.97]And I would just sit here for probably three hours.
[28:30.77]And the whole time, I would just be watching an Ernest movie in my head.
[28:34.83]I would see back-to-back Ernest movies.
[28:39.66]That's what would be going on up here.
[28:43.22]Which actually, that sounds kind of awesome to watch the Ernest movie right now.
[28:45.70]I mean, that sounds... I mean, which one?
[28:47.58]There are so many good ones.
[28:48.66]Alright.
[28:52.80]Oh!
[28:55.50]Doesn't that look like something?
[29:04.42]got it it's one more above that one I need okay there's two of those though fuck oh fuck this one I think that's like a little guy I think that's a little guy not part of this I think he's a bro where is he
[29:36.16]He's holding it.
[29:36.80]He's facing the left.
[29:41.50]Where is this guy?
[29:44.88]Oh, he's riding the dragon.
[29:47.50]You can't see because of the light, but... Right there on the purple dragon.
[29:52.04]Alright, so he's riding the purple dragon, which is over here.
[29:58.37]That's like up this way.
[30:00.53]Okay.
[30:02.39]I'm still trying to separate out colors.
[30:07.80]gonna have to get my stomach in the camera I'm sorry I could probably start to do this too just get them out of the way alright if you see I think this is the red dragon over here the claw on his head maybe over there somewhere okay
[30:34.01]I almost actually have it pretty much all the major colors are up here and over here.
[30:39.48]Wait.
[30:41.86]Looks like it could be the dragon.
[30:48.12]Eat the pieces.
[30:49.63]You're so organized.
[30:50.45]I actually kind of, I'm not right now.
[30:52.45]I thought I was going to be, but it's alright.
[30:57.05]I'll get these up here.
[30:59.58]It is true, though.
[31:00.06]Once you do get the outline, then you can actually start to go.
[31:02.78]This is the bottom piece, for sure.
[31:04.52]Yes, it is.
[31:06.16]These are probably all bottoms.
[31:11.10]I think this is the guy riding.
[31:14.66]No, I think it's this.
[31:15.46]I think we got it.
[31:16.08]Did we get it?
[31:17.84]Hey, we got it.
[31:22.18]No, we didn't.
[31:23.79]Damn it.
[31:24.05]Does that really not go there?
[31:33.74]Not right.
[31:34.32]It's alright.
[31:34.74]I'll get it later.
[31:35.40]I got this dragon pretty much done.
[31:44.68]Alright, let's go back up here.
[31:45.55]I'm sorry, I'm gonna be like bumping into you because I need to like get over here.
[31:51.29]And this table might seem like a regular table.
[31:53.83]This is a long ass table.
[31:55.65]Like I have to reach across the whole thing.
[31:57.99]Like I'm reaching across the whole table right now.
[32:00.31]It's a very long and wide table.
[32:03.08]So I stole a piece.
[32:06.46]That's fine, I don't need to finish the whole thing.
[32:09.00]I was never gonna finish this.
[32:09.92]I was gonna work on it for maybe 10 minutes at a time.
[32:13.05]So, like, we're getting close to the end.
[32:15.75]I think it's pretty good progress.
[32:18.38]Okay, now let it sit on the table for three weeks, walk by it every fucking day, and then eventually just take your arm and drag it across and put it back in the box.
[32:28.68]Okay.
[32:30.42]Alright, cool.
[32:32.44]I'm not giving up that easily.
[32:42.47]it's a little too bright I might turn this down a little it's easier to see the pieces now than what it was before the glare a little too much glare maybe puzzles are not chill yeah they are did you what do you mean what do I look like this one's too hard
[33:07.08]This is not too hard.
[33:08.58]I'm fine.
[33:09.44]I'm just going.
[33:10.46]This is not too hard.
[33:13.48]How have my hemorrhoids been?
[33:35.77]Huh?
[33:44.57]hmm hey shield guy take a look shield guy is that not going to connect can you see I got a shield guy right here you might not be able to see it but it's close wait maybe this shield guy can connect up here damn it there are there only two shield guys so what the hell's the problem here
[34:17.11]One?
[34:17.25]Dude, there's more than two shield guys?
[34:21.48]Oh my god, there's like a hundred shield guys.
[34:24.48]There's like twenty.
[34:25.56]There's ten.
[34:26.74]At least, over here on the right.
[34:29.88]Okay, I thought it was only two.
[34:37.45]Well, put all the shield guys over here.
[34:39.23]Alright, I'm coming over here.
[34:42.07]You're not going to be able to see.
[34:43.69]That's fucking awful.
[34:46.29]Let's see if I can make it so you can see.
[34:47.51]Because I want you to see kind of what I'm doing.
[34:58.27]Where the fuck does this one go?
[34:59.71]This one doesn't go to anything.
[35:00.67]Look how big this... It's got like a big butt on the end.
[35:04.59]It doesn't go into anything.
[35:05.45]This one has like a huge butt.
[35:12.44]But it won't go into anything.
[35:28.21]I think this is part of the snowy mountain.
[35:32.03]Like up here somewhere?
[35:32.93]Like right there?
[35:33.41]Part of the mountain?
[35:35.33]Flip it this way?
[35:36.11]Like that?
[35:38.35]I think this is part of the snowy mountain.
[35:41.15]Yeah, it definitely is.
[35:44.68]of the cloud yes the cloud but it's also the mountain so would be going like this maybe there we go alright there we go there we go I got it right there alright now this cloud travels this way ah that's only 300 pieces it's not like 3 000. it's only gonna take like another few hours or maybe not well I'm just chilling I told you I wanted to do a jigsaw and that's exactly what we're doing
[36:15.16]Alright, well, these, this is alright.
[36:18.84]Find the one that matches.
[36:22.43]Hold on.
[36:24.43]Right here.
[36:26.95]No, shit.
[36:30.17]Leave this here for now.
[36:30.98]It's going to be longer than it took you to beat Elden Ring.
[36:39.03]long did it take me to beat Malenia how many attempts did it take for me to beat Malenia put on some music what do you guys want for music I think it was like four hours or three hours for me to beat Malenia can I do a 300 piece jigsaw puzzle in the time it took me to beat Malenia what do you think no put on Elden Ring music
[37:08.54]Elden Ring DLC?
[37:10.78]OST?
[37:11.72]Wait, that doesn't exist yet?
[37:16.89]I'll put on Elden Ring OST.
[37:27.23]I'm going to put it pretty low, though, because it can get pretty intense, can't it?
[37:31.78]I won't be able to hear it.
[37:34.53]but you very much will.
[37:36.19]I don't know what you can hear right now, but I think you can hear me.
[37:44.10]Okay.
[37:47.96]How's that?
[37:48.28]Is that alright?
[37:53.28]Your mic is kind of low.
[37:54.66]I think it's because of where I am.
[37:55.82]I could drop it a little bit, but I don't want to get in the way of the puzzle.
[38:02.04]When I'm standing here like this, it probably sounds fine.
[38:04.83]Alright.
[38:10.01]So.
[38:10.25]It's good now?
[38:10.73]Yeah, it's only going to be like that when I go that way.
[38:12.77]Alright.
[38:14.85]I'm going to get a sip.
[38:17.22]This is way too intense.
[38:23.36]Go on.
[39:01.35]Where's the orange dragon?
[39:11.38]I see shield, guys.
[39:12.84]I am being weird tonight, and I apologize already.
[39:16.32]I haven't streamed in like two months.
[39:18.58]I forgot how to do it.
[39:28.03]These are going to start connecting, though, over here.
[39:30.66]Alright, I need to get this shit out of my fucking peripheral.
[39:34.40]Because it's actually annoying me.
[39:36.91]When there's this much shit in the middle, it pisses me off.
[39:41.05]Get the fuck away from me.
[39:42.49]And look at that.
[39:43.51]I ended up... Hey, you want to see how fucking greasy I am?
[39:48.13]Hey, what do you think about that?
[39:50.17]Okay.
[39:55.20]Get some more sky.
[39:57.24]He's getting pissed.
[40:10.67]okay hey hey up there it goes I see a snowy mountain okay another snowy uh snow and clouds okay okay
[40:33.28]Once I get actually all a top row, then I'll be able to know how many pieces it is across.
[40:39.80]It probably says it on the box, but it's cheating.
[40:43.13]You figure it out as you go.
[40:43.97]A lot of grass.
[40:53.35]I see a shield guy.
[40:54.49]Anybody see a shield guy?
[40:56.26]Speak up.
[40:56.68]Anybody see a shield guy?
[41:04.79]Bottom left.
[41:15.74]You did see a shield guy.
[41:17.46]You were not lying.
[41:18.66]Okay.
[41:19.12]Alright.
[41:19.42]Any more shield guys?
[41:24.37]He's already connected.
[41:25.37]That's cheating.
[41:43.03]What is so funny?
[41:44.53]What's so funny?
[41:45.94]I can hear you laughing.
[41:46.98]What's so funny?
[41:48.42]What's so funny?
[41:50.10]I can hear you laughing.
[41:51.34]What's so funny?
[42:00.41]Why does the music sound so scary?
[42:02.05]This is the Elden Ring OST.
[42:03.57]I don't know.
[42:14.82]Has he said Gideon off near yet?
[42:18.52]That's my favorite part.
[42:19.40]Alright, I think we're getting kind of close to doing the entire top pot.
[42:27.56]Look at that.
[42:29.04]Look at how good I've separated.
[42:31.36]Hey, shield guy!
[42:38.23]No, that's not a shield guy.
[42:39.93]What even is this?
[42:48.59]this is I got it already that's good now where is that I need to get a good view of where that is shut up shut up okay oh it's right there look okay that's kind of right to the left okay
[43:22.96]Oh!
[43:25.02]Hey!
[43:26.24]So, I'm working on some stuff at Offbrand.
[43:29.52]Why don't we talk about it for a few minutes?
[43:31.33]Sounds good to me.
[43:32.07]Okay.
[43:32.87]So, you may have seen on Ludwig's channel a show called Unpaid Intern.
[43:38.09]I've been working on that show a lot.
[43:41.92]It's been really fun.
[43:42.76]It's a series on Ludwig's channel.
[43:47.04]A lot of the stuff you see on that show is stuff that I had a lot to do with.
[43:51.60]I'm in it.
[43:53.48]I'm a character in it.
[43:56.06]It's been fun to do that.
[43:58.91]Yeah, I think shooting for a bunch of episodes, so that should be really cool.
[44:04.47]If you want to kind of see what I've been working on, it's Unpaid Intern.
[44:10.40]Second episode, we'll see you pretty soon.
[44:15.19]Alright, enough about work.
[44:16.41]Hey, how the heck are the kids?
[44:19.63]Huh?
[44:20.25]How the heck are the kids?
[44:22.15]Doing good?
[44:25.06]I don't give a shit about your kids.
[44:26.42]I just say that to sound like I care.
[44:29.12]I genuinely do not fucking care.
[44:34.80]Okay.
[44:36.40]So... That looks like it fits.
[44:40.75]Doesn't though.
[44:41.23]Alright, I can start to do the talk.
[44:46.08]That was evil?
[44:50.45]We meld.
[44:51.23]We mend the world.
[44:52.53]We meld the world to our own image.
[44:55.89]I think I have no more pieces in the sky.
[44:57.29]I think one more here.
[45:03.33]Alright.
[45:04.21]It's going to be weird, but I might do the puzzle from that end.
[45:07.63]So I might be in the way.
[45:10.45]Do you really care that much?
[45:14.74]Because I'm kind of constricted here.
[45:16.32]Alright, hold on.
[45:22.20]I need a solid blue for right there.
[45:25.10]Solid blue.
[45:36.29]I don't see any solid blue.
[45:52.30]I got it.
[45:56.63]And then, no, no, no way.
[45:58.49]No way, right?
[46:00.09]No way.
[46:01.09]No way.
[46:01.47]This is fucking ridiculous if this actually happens.
[46:05.86]No way.
[46:07.50]No way.
[46:16.10]That one didn't work.
[46:19.53]Okay, now I need... This is where you start to really... Oh, this is when you just steamroll it.
[46:27.54]Yeah, here we go.
[46:28.58]Uh-huh.
[46:32.40]Let me get a good look at that, huh?
[46:34.16]Let me see.
[46:35.72]Uh-huh.
[46:36.36]Okay.
[46:37.78]Yeah, you see, you fucked it all up.
[46:39.18]I wouldn't have done it like that.
[46:43.82]I still don't have all the way to the left.
[46:50.61]none of these fit leave one that oh no it's gonna have a top no no that look at that that fits that's like perfect look at this look at that that's no it's kind of perfect
[47:27.01]no this is not working this was hidden down here alright there was a big piece there's a big there's a big one where is it it was a big one
[48:00.20]That's it.
[48:00.78]I got it.
[48:09.12]I need like a little... I need like a pouch right here.
[48:12.20]Like a kangaroo pouch to hold all this.
[48:16.65]Limgrave OST is too low energy for this.
[48:18.97]Oh, wait.
[48:19.35]Is this the one that goes... Or is that different?
[48:35.00]I think that's, that's fine.
[48:36.98]I think it's okay for right now.
[48:42.10]Did I get it lined up?
[48:44.78]Genuinely, it is exactly that.
[48:51.03]Doesn't it do that for like 25 straight minutes?
[48:55.11]It does it for a pretty long time from what I remember.
[48:56.87]Okay.
[48:58.01]Alright.
[48:58.55]Back to what we were doing.
[48:59.57]I'm doing, I'm, I'm moving.
[49:05.15]Already got shit working down here that I didn't even realize was here.
[49:07.59]Already... Look at this.
[49:11.64]That one doesn't fit.
[49:14.28]It's okay.
[49:18.70]No, we're doing the top.
[49:19.90]Stop going anywhere else.
[49:21.12]We're doing the top.
[49:23.05]I fucking know it's going to an F. Okay.
[49:28.69]Okay.
[49:38.02]They're all the same color.
[49:39.38]That's the part that makes it so hard.
[49:43.18]It's like they're all blue.
[49:44.76]All of these things are blue.
[49:47.80]And they don't fit.
[49:48.64]You have to really push them.
[49:50.56]I just broke this one.
[49:52.66]Where are my gloves?
[49:56.94]Oh.
[49:59.72]Got it.
[50:01.58]Okay.
[50:03.84]Now we move down this way.
[50:13.36]Okay, hold on.
[50:14.10]Just get the ones that look exactly the same right next to each other.
[50:17.86]I don't know.
[50:18.16]I don't understand how this is not the piece that goes here.
[50:20.52]I need like a little cloud at the corner.
[50:42.42]I feel like I'm looking for bugs to eat.
[50:45.68]Like, if I'm just going to every so often just be like... There has to be... Okay, there is another piece.
[50:54.96]What is on the end of that?
[51:00.42]There is a dragon that flies by here, so I'm going to put it here.
[51:05.33]I don't know what is connected to that one.
[51:39.98]trying to take the glare off the pieces which doesn't look too bad I don't think okay anything that's green is going in my pockets
[52:15.93]I need a better visual than just a bunch of fucking slop.
[52:20.79]I want more than just slop on the table.
[52:24.73]Because then you can see, oh yeah, there's that piece, there's that piece.
[52:29.31]You gotta work smarter.
[52:32.01]Not hotter.
[52:32.47]Alright, that's getting a little bit better for my brain to comprehend what the fuck is even happening here.
[52:40.58]Okay.
[52:45.47]dragon this is a this is the face of a green dragon where's the green dragon up top yeah green dragon's right up there that okay that's kind of up in the middle now I don't need to worry about that yet I can definitely put this together up here what is taking so long
[53:12.05]It's absolutely this corner.
[53:13.87]Let me try to build up from the top right corner, because I feel like I'm able to get that much easier than for some reason this side, which I don't know why I can't.
[53:25.06]I seem to be missing some piece somewhere.
[53:26.78]I don't know.
[53:34.33]I'm obsessing over this one piece that goes up top, but I need it.
[53:40.88]There's no piece in the ground or something, right?
[53:44.06]But when I was like being an idiot and I pushed my hands out in the beginning?
[53:47.06]I don't think so.
[53:59.35]Oh, fuck you.
[54:01.17]There it is.
[54:01.55]That's it right there.
[54:04.01]Okay, good.
[54:10.27]Disconnect it here.
[54:12.59]No.
[54:12.93]No.
[54:15.19]Oh, who told me to do the... Oh, there it is.
[54:20.79]Okay.
[54:21.39]Who told me to do the clouds first?
[54:22.53]Because that was smart.
[54:26.63]Because I can get all these stupid pieces out of the goddamn way.
[54:31.07]Okay.
[54:34.19]Does that look good?
[54:38.19]Yep, there we go.
[54:38.89]These two...
[54:44.02]okay there we go alright we've almost got the top row and when I say we I mean me because I'm the one doing the puzzle you are merely laughing at your screen maybe you're doing your own I hope you are put on Silent Hill
[55:20.75]No.
[55:22.40]We gotta listen to Elden Ring for a few... Can you even hear it?
[55:26.96]It's not even... What's even happening?
[55:30.02]Okay, it is playing.
[55:30.64]I was just making sure it was still playing.
[55:34.35]Yep.
[55:34.85]Boom.
[55:36.41]And I got this.
[55:37.15]I'm about to get the whole top row.
[55:39.13]And I am going to fucking freak out.
[55:43.77]gonna be like oh man here we go this is where this is where it all comes down to right here this is okay this is how we go through this uh-huh okay this is how we go for it connected in up here no this is doesn't fit up here
[56:08.72]This is how we go for it.
[56:10.66]This is the way we do it.
[56:13.52]Wait, no.
[56:18.98]Desperately trying to make this exciting.
[56:22.12]Okay, and this is the way we go.
[56:24.32]This is how we do it, guys.
[56:25.92]I don't really care if it's exciting.
[56:33.35]It's just kind of fun to do.
[56:34.51]If this doesn't excite you.
[56:40.56]Whatever.
[56:43.06]Exciting me.
[56:45.08]Oh, no.
[56:53.81]Where's the one hour mark?
[56:56.29]Oh, yeah.
[56:56.77]No, that's fine.
[56:58.99]Once you get all the pieces kind of in the right spot, it's very much easy to... It's very simple.
[57:06.60]You need to get the right...
[57:09.94]Alright, so let me at least finish this top part.
[57:14.46]Is this the end?
[57:15.02]Hey, that's the end.
[57:16.50]I got the end.
[57:17.42]I got the corner right now.
[57:18.98]It's over.
[57:19.42]Look.
[57:21.36]Corner has been initiated.
[57:25.79]Now... I've got to connect this over here.
[57:30.87]Wait, hold on.
[57:32.39]Any more top pieces?
[57:33.87]So this one is the other corner.
[57:37.15]This one needs to go here.
[57:38.11]Then I get a really good idea of what the heck is happening.
[57:42.03]Okay.
[57:46.31]Or pieces that go up, like into the clouds.
[57:52.85]If there's a piece with a tip of the cloud on the end, I'm interested in it.
[58:00.55]How's auto?
[58:01.03]Auto's doing great.
[58:03.38]Oh, there we go.
[58:04.36]Good.
[58:05.14]Uh, Otto just had, I think I said this last time, but he just had a dental.
[58:08.72]It had been a long time, so glad to get that out of the way.
[58:13.02]Because it had been more than like a year or two, a couple of years since he had it done.
[58:17.37]So he needed it.
[58:17.99]There we go.
[58:20.17]Alright, I got this side here.
[58:23.65]Whoa, don't drop a bunch of shit.
[58:24.79]I'm going to end up with like three pieces missing and I'm going to be so annoyed by it, but whatever.
[58:29.17]Okay.
[58:32.49]So this is now this end.
[58:34.25]Is that right?
[58:38.82]That's right.
[58:39.40]Okay.
[58:39.68]So there it is.
[58:40.38]I just got to get this middle piece and then I got the whole top row.
[58:50.38]And then we build down from the top row.
[58:55.28]Get it?
[59:02.36]Is there not one piece that can... Oh, wait a minute.
[59:06.86]Oh shit, this thing is much bigger than I thought it was.
[59:10.03]Okay, so what's missing here?
[59:19.66]Was there a blanket on the wall behind me?
[59:21.42]For sound dampening.
[59:22.88]When I did VR streams, the room was so echoey that I had to put a blanket up to absorb some of the sound.
[59:30.58]Otherwise it would be horrible.
[59:31.46]It would be big reverberating in your ears right now.
[59:35.85]It has to be a flat top like that.
[59:37.81]Ladies and gentlemen.
[59:43.61]It is a complete top row.
[59:50.20]How long has it been?
[59:51.18]An hour or two?
[59:52.68]In a couple hours?
[59:54.50]You didn't see the dragon that was down here.
[59:55.82]Almost nearing completion.
[59:58.55]Okay.
[59:59.37]So now, let's stick with the clouds and just come down.
[60:06.35]This is a cloud piece right here.
[60:09.17]You fucking idiot.
[60:10.17]How can you not see that?
[60:12.16]Look.
[60:13.46]God.
[60:13.78]I have to spell it out.
[60:24.04]said what a moron I don't know if you're talking about me or the fake person that I made up because either or that's funny okay no oh right no no this there's some grass on this I'm gonna leave this one down this one right there could be right here no no so this one is oh yep there it is cool
[60:55.64]This is also kind of half in the clouds.
[61:00.07]Let me get another look at this.
[61:10.65]I think it's right there.
[61:11.53]Is the grass on the edge?
[61:14.50]You think grass on the edge right there?
[61:15.94]I'm thinking right there.
[61:18.42]Do you see shrubberies?
[61:33.72]Right here?
[61:34.98]Right there?
[61:35.66]Probably right here, though.
[61:41.05]You've got shrubbery on it, too.
[61:48.17]No.
[61:51.21]No.
[61:52.35]I need some side... I need some side pieces, please.
[62:02.44]Good.
[62:05.34]I need another side.
[62:06.08]I need another side piece.
[62:09.90]And it needs to be... Okay, that's the top of the snowy mountain over here.
[62:14.11]There is a dragon.
[62:21.13]Oh, the music's still... Yeah, it's fine.
[62:23.55]Alright, so we're right here.
[62:24.43]I don't know if you can see that very well, but...
[62:28.08]I have this left edge right there.
[62:30.44]Looks like we're about to touch the top of the mountain.
[62:33.23]So I need snowy mountain and then grass as a left side piece.
[62:38.13]No, not in this one.
[62:50.79]That has to be there, right?
[62:51.83]That has to be.
[62:53.17]I can't think of another place where that is.
[62:56.15]This is actually like stuck on there now.
[62:58.21]It was so close that it moved, but it was right there.
[63:02.84]Once this comes down, I'm going to move this down and I'll move the pieces to the top.
[63:06.04]So it's much easier for you to see.
[63:08.36]I think this is over here.
[63:17.93]What?
[63:20.73]The music is terrifying.
[63:25.41]I can't hear it.
[63:26.39]I don't know what it is.
[63:27.37]I know it's Elden Ring.
[63:35.57]I'm working on a puzzle right now, okay?
[63:39.15]These are together.
[63:40.85]In what way, I don't know.
[63:41.77]Ooh, there's a couple of these that are together.
[63:43.31]Alright, let's start actually getting this shit out of the way because I want to be able to build it down from here.
[63:47.93]I promise I didn't steal these.
[63:52.18]I didn't steal these.
[63:53.06]I didn't steal them.
[63:55.62]Taking him out of my pockets.
[63:56.62]I didn't steal them.
[64:03.05]There's another cloud.
[64:03.81]I'm thinking... I'm thinking, hold on, I've got to do this placement correctly.
[64:14.45]No.
[64:15.51]Bingo.
[64:16.65]No, shit.
[64:18.66]Bingo.
[64:19.80]Nope.
[64:21.30]Bingo.
[64:22.50]Yep.
[64:22.94]Nope.
[64:25.08]Oh, fucking yep.
[64:26.10]Bingo.
[64:27.96]Yeah.
[64:28.70]No, that's not the one.
[64:34.86]So what the hell?
[64:37.70]I don't know.
[64:40.56]I guess I'll try this one.
[64:42.68]This one's weird.
[64:43.42]Okay.
[64:45.32]Got it.
[64:47.56]Very good.
[64:48.14]There's a dragon forming up here.
[64:54.11]Alright, let's go ahead and make this a little bit better, as this looks like shit.
[65:01.44]So, uh, I'm gonna move something.
[65:03.70]Green dragon.
[65:04.60]Green dragon is about right here.
[65:07.44]Start putting the shit where it belongs.
[65:10.66]It's been two hours?
[65:11.76]It has not been two hours.
[65:14.78]How long has it been?
[65:16.00]It's been like 45 minutes.
[65:18.55]How long has it been?
[65:21.95]it has been one hour yeah we're just getting started we're just hanging out I tell you I'm just hanging out it was the worst when I had a schizophrenia breakdown in so there's a lot of ads on this alright I need left pieces and I'm gonna lose them
[65:48.43]It's a lot of grass.
[65:49.83]And I took my grass pieces out already.
[65:54.58]Okay, I'm gonna... How about if I talk like this for the rest of the time I play?
[66:01.38]This piece looks like it could probably go here.
[66:04.90]Right there, I think.
[66:07.43]That one.
[66:11.95]I think this one... Oh, that's a left side piece.
[66:27.74]I love just relaxing with my puzzles what song is on right now it's probably like oh I love puzzles
[66:49.86]Maybe we should just move shit with your mind.
[66:51.46]Because like, I could do this so much faster if I could just be like, that one goes there, that's there, that one goes over there, that one goes up there, that one goes down, this one goes down.
[66:58.72]Instead of having to be like... Oh, I need telekinesis.
[67:12.72]I haven't put a piece in in 10 straight minutes.
[67:15.12]Alright, just stop talking and do it.
[67:17.95]side piece side piece going down this edge here I hope I hope so okay alright going up from the dragon head I'm gonna do this right now forget about this those of you that wanted me to finish the clouds oh you're gonna you're gonna unfollow because we're moving on from that
[67:43.74]I have a ton of these little guys here and I'm going to try to build this out.
[68:09.00]Nothing fucking fits.
[68:17.43]I just need to get the top part of the dragon's head.
[68:22.29]That doesn't fit?
[68:24.50]What?
[68:26.62]That looks like it should fit perfectly.
[68:33.10]God damn it.
[68:36.70]Side piece, bottom left.
[68:38.36]Side pieces, bottom left.
[68:43.04]Thank you.
[68:46.04]Side piece here too.
[68:47.02]Alright.
[68:48.50]Wait, don't mess this up.
[68:52.44]Can I connect one of these?
[68:53.56]Check it out.
[69:01.57]Oh, you know it's going to feel good when I put this one on.
[69:06.21]It doesn't go there.
[69:07.98]But I do have... Take a look.
[69:09.32]I'll show you.
[69:09.70]I'll get a good close-up so you can see what we're working with here.
[69:12.46]That is a connected...
[69:14.89]I feel like I'm presenting coins on, like, fucking QVC.
[69:20.02]So, as you see here, fully from the mint.
[69:23.84]Sterling silver.
[69:25.38]Sterling silver, by the way.
[69:28.76]Only 200 ever printed.
[69:29.81]Can you see the shield?
[69:40.75]Come on.
[69:43.71]Yep.
[69:44.69]Nope.
[69:47.37]There's one, two, there's three standing.
[69:49.57]One has a big thing in his hand.
[69:53.75]Is there any more shield guys over here?
[69:57.42]I don't know what that guy's doing, but he's hanging out.
[70:02.66]Side piece.
[70:03.40]Thank you.
[70:03.84]Side piece is coming to our building.
[70:09.15]Watch me do this in front.
[70:10.37]Oh, no.
[70:26.61]I'm not cheating you look at the thing before you do it okay don't get excited we've got a long way to go these are all side pieces though so this is great you know I really appreciate that I appreciate it I appreciate when you guys help me I appreciate that
[70:55.52]Alpha brain help support your focus at moments with countless tasks and preparation Get off my greasy hands Alright shield guy shield guy alert No, these are spear guys different

[71:18.71]Right down here.
[71:19.26]I don't know what is so funny right now, but I'm laughing at it for no reason.
[71:26.99]I don't even know what it is.
[71:53.55]It's not ready yet Whose tail is that?
[72:28.70]watching a caveman try to make fire well that would be easy I could do that very easily okay this goes here though alright alright alright left side pieces excuse me please I could use a little bit of that help and no I don't because that one goes over here somewhere this is not a side piece that could be
[72:53.17]That could also be a down piece.
[72:56.23]What are these bushes?
[72:57.11]There's so many bushes.
[72:57.97]It's so hard to tell which bush is what bush.
[73:00.89]Like, how am I supposed to tell which bush is which bush?
[73:02.79]Part of the green dragon.
[73:08.70]Alright, hold on.
[73:10.34]Dude, I've got these shield guys.
[73:14.10]And these guys with the spears.
[73:18.08]I've got to get them in the same spot.
[73:21.10]How's it going to get to it?
[73:23.50]another spear guy spear guy down is that a shield guy I mean they all belong in the lower left this is a side piece of some kind it looks like it could be a shield guy
[73:51.25]I know exactly where that is.
[73:53.25]Right freaking there.
[73:56.13]Right there.
[73:57.84]Alright.
[74:00.08]I think so.
[74:04.84]Like right here somewhere.
[74:10.76]Right down here.
[74:12.62]Change the music please.
[74:13.66]Alright.
[74:14.04]What do you guys want for new music?
[74:16.93]Just give me some options.
[74:18.93]I'll change it but I want some options.
[74:22.92]And don't say pluck.
[74:28.88]I love pluck, but don't say it.
[74:31.20]Alright, we've got a green hand.
[74:36.18]Right there.
[74:41.98]There's a big green hand.
[74:48.70]Where's that?
[74:49.22]Are those trees?
[74:51.76]Those might be trees.
[74:56.09]Ah, there it is.
[74:58.23]Right there.
[75:00.55]That is what we call a left side piece.
[75:05.05]That goes like right here.
[75:05.99]I think that actually might be pretty close.
[75:08.84]That's pretty close to the bottom, but not all the way.
[75:10.90]Okay.
[75:14.16]Parcel good.
[75:14.72]We know that this is kind of down here.
[75:18.20]Alright, we've got some side pieces.
[75:21.16]Alright.
[75:27.07]There's a right side piece.
[75:30.99]God damn it, really?
[75:36.28]Where are the clouds?
[75:37.06]Oh, hold on.
[75:57.50]Alright, there's a shitload of clouds up here.
[76:00.52]Go down, wait, side piece.
[76:02.74]Could be a left side piece, but it could be a right side piece.
[76:05.15]I'm going to put it over here for now.
[76:07.63]Just for now.
[76:12.33]You can't always plan when you'll need a gun.
[76:14.71]Rational gun owners carry not because it's a weapon, but because... We need, okay, we need a bunch...
[76:26.70]Alright, I... I don't... I don't... Ads are just playing.
[76:30.98]I don't know what the fuck is happening.
[76:32.52]I'm not on my... I'm not on like a YouTube fucking premium or whatever.
[76:45.03]Where... I'm gonna smash.
[76:49.77]This is a right side piece.
[76:51.55]Oh...
[76:55.40]Take a look.
[76:56.44]You can't see it, but you can still kind of see it.
[76:59.70]If you squint your eyes really hard, you can see it.
[77:04.51]This is a dragon over there.
[77:05.67]I know that.
[77:07.27]This is not where that goes.
[77:15.03]Bingo.
[77:15.71]Yes.
[77:18.96]Yes.
[77:21.66]More of that.
[77:25.55]Get it in a row.
[77:26.53]Bingo.
[77:31.69]This is part of the dragon.
[77:34.01]Kind of.
[77:34.65]No, not quite.
[77:39.88]Oh, more snow and a little bit of top 10 woodcutting tricks.
[77:46.52]Alright.
[77:48.38]Alright.
[77:48.82]Alright.
[77:49.04]Well, it's been an hour.
[77:49.88]Let's change the music.
[77:51.30]It's been 38 minutes.
[77:52.15]What do you guys want to hear?
[77:53.97]Come to a consensus and I'll change it.
[77:58.83]Okay, so this guy is up there.
[78:02.07]So this is going to be a pretty sick placement.
[78:05.35]Very, very soon.
[78:06.61]Right there.
[78:09.22]Yep.
[78:10.44]Is that dragon coming down here?
[78:13.86]See, now I'm starting to put it together.
[78:17.38]Got this kind of combo one here.
[78:18.80]Boom.
[78:23.22]Alright.
[78:23.74]I'm almost ready to move a bunch of pieces out of the gosh damn it fucking way.
[78:36.89]And then we really just, you know, that's when we really start fucking cooking.
[78:40.69]What does that look like?
[78:48.37]What does that look like?
[78:48.99]I'll show you what it looks like.
[79:03.18]That's him, right?
[79:03.82]Yeah, that's him.
[79:08.43]Oh, it's a side piece.
[79:15.41]That's cheating.
[79:17.71]All the people that are calling me cheaters, I feel like you've not ever done a jigsaw puzzle before.
[79:21.27]Yep.
[79:37.12]Looking good.
[79:42.06]Finish the big dragon and I don't know what you said.
[79:44.04]I don't know what you're going to do.
[79:47.62]Make it appropriate.
[79:50.54]Who's saying what?
[79:51.91]Two side pieces, bottom left.
[79:57.57]Hold on.
[80:02.49]Let me see.
[80:03.33]I'm going to show you what I got working with here.
[80:06.80]That needs to be a much better system than what I have.
[80:11.00]They weren't kidding.
[80:12.99]This one's pretty close to all these, then.
[80:14.89]Hold on.
[80:19.37]Damn it.
[80:20.21]It's up here somewhere.
[80:22.40]No, you're right.
[80:22.92]You're right.
[80:23.26]You got it.
[80:23.88]You're right.
[80:25.18]I'll keep it over there.
[80:29.74]Ooh.
[80:29.84]It's great when you find a random connection.
[80:36.65]Now, this is the... This one's up.
[80:39.66]it's the green one right there yeah so this is this one I'll try to make it right now is this the red dragon this is the green dragon I don't know what song they're from but is this the green dragon not even close
[81:11.78]Is Elden Ring still playing?
[81:12.50]Alright, what are we doing?
[81:14.24]Miku.
[81:20.88]I think this stream is going to get claimed.
[81:27.31]How about let's end with Miku?
[81:30.29]Let's have Miku be the thing that the last piece goes in, and then Miku plays this out.
[81:34.49]You alright with that?
[81:39.81]Mm-hmm.
[81:45.73]Alright, so what should we do instead?
[81:48.63]What was the next on the list?
[81:51.07]I guess I could just click it, couldn't I?
[81:53.64]What else is on here?
[81:56.26]Katamari.
[81:57.14]Yeah, that sounds good.
[82:00.60]I could go over here for a second.
[82:01.90]Keyboard's over here.
[82:02.46]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[82:14.79]How's that for a volume?
[82:19.79]Is that good for volume?
[82:20.81]We don't want it to be too loud.
[82:22.23]We just want it to be kind of in the background.
[82:30.70]This looks perfect right here.
[82:32.40]Check this out.
[82:32.92]Just let gravity do it.
[82:35.42]You know what I mean?
[82:36.50]Just let gravity do it.
[82:39.12]Alright.
[82:40.54]Nice.
[82:51.11]need here that is just all all bushes and I mean all pretty much all bushes and I think I got it right there another thing all bushes with a with a nub at the top

[85:28.35]Is right there.
[85:39.56]Alright, good good.
[85:42.56]There are two side pieces in the middle
[85:59.77]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[86:02.57]I'm cooking with something over here, hold on.
[86:07.56]Hold on, cooking with something.
[86:10.22]Hold on.
[86:14.32]Yeah.
[86:16.44]Yeah.
[86:21.32]This is the castle that's in the middle.
[86:28.89]And then this builds up to this part.
[86:30.85]Okay, I know where this is.
[86:34.10]I just need the connecting piece.
[86:35.26]And then where is that?
[86:35.84]That's like right here.
[86:37.32]Okay.
[86:40.06]Yep.
[86:41.18]Time to do a little bit of upkeep.
[86:44.12]Over the next 10 to 20 minutes or so, I'm going to be separating these into grass and dragon.
[86:49.75]Kind of grass.
[86:54.51]This is dragon.
[87:01.16]okay okay that looks good grass or dragon I don't care about anything else this is uh here good just start pulling them out just start pulling them out don't even think about it this dragon red dragon
[87:29.78]I don't want to see what it looks like these are very disappointed oh who has the okay you have these red dragon has the wings to do that I'm gonna be hard alright only talking about okay look look at this where's that supposed to go who the hell knows getting in the zone
[87:59.66]yeah I'm getting the zone this is green dragon green dragon's legs alright green dragon is kind of weird still am I I'm missing these two pieces for the clouds up here
[88:26.94]guys see any clouds I see this one here but that's this one right there boom what nursing home are you streaming from right now I'm of complete puzzle interest right now nothing else matters to me
[88:56.87]Okay, I got, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:59.34]It's out of the way.
[89:00.28]Because I got the piece here.
[89:02.34]That works.
[89:05.62]Like that.
[89:07.76]And I think, can this connect to the top here?
[89:09.64]If it does, I'm going to, oh, no.
[89:15.50]No.
[89:17.40]What?
[89:18.62]Go here?
[89:19.08]It does.
[89:20.90]Alright, I'm starting to build up the middle.
[89:22.50]What about right there?
[89:23.26]No.
[89:23.46]No.
[89:25.24]Okay, so this is above this.
[89:28.32]Alright, get more of this shit out of the way.
[89:32.16]I'll put it in my pockets for now.
[89:35.44]Just remind me that I have it.
[89:37.62]Green dragon is right there.
[89:38.78]Again, all these just... These are just like fucking green.
[89:44.03]I need a better visual.
[89:44.81]I need a much better visual.
[89:49.85]Yeah, all these dark green, dark green, dark green, dark green, dark green.
[89:52.25]Now get out of here.
[89:53.89]Deal with you later.
[90:01.70]Okay, this is right... This castle thing here is right in the middle.
[90:07.73]So, you know what I'm gonna do?
[90:10.87]Whatever.
[90:11.23]Let's just build the middle out.
[90:12.21]Oh, here we go.
[90:19.36]Don't eat the pieces.
[90:21.08]We should use binoculars.
[90:21.76]Binoculars.
[90:31.69]Okay, this is another one here.
[90:32.91]Yep.
[90:35.79]See, now the middle is going to start to get built.
[90:38.79]I can start to move some pieces around.
[90:40.31]I can... I'll get this done.
[90:43.75]I'll get this done in no time.
[90:48.51]No, not quite.
[90:50.07]This is right here, though.
[90:54.52]How we doing?
[90:54.90]How you guys doing?
[90:59.02]Can you guys see?
[91:00.48]Can you guys see what's going on here?
[91:13.06]Looks like it should fit.
[91:14.31]It does.
[91:14.63]Alright, so that fits there.
[91:16.33]A little building piece.
[91:19.41]Oh no, this is this one up here.
[91:24.35]Alright, orange is a little lighter for you, but darker orange is up top left.
[91:30.87]So this kind of lighter white beige is in the middle.
[91:35.65]Nice.
[91:57.15]get the glare off these I'm having trouble seeing too I'm also having trouble seeing some of them because I got a light right here but I have the overhead light too to be causing the problems but once it gets a little darker I think I can still green dragon oh this is this is also a green dragon isn't it
[92:24.50]Side piece, far middle left.
[92:36.39]Oh shit, it is!
[92:40.85]This is absolutely a side piece, you're right.
[92:42.85]Alright, cool.
[92:43.91]But it can't connect anything.
[92:45.19]Is none of this gonna fit here?
[93:03.04]What?
[93:05.41]I'm shocked that these are not going together.
[93:07.23]These are the pieces up here that I'm neglecting, hold on.
[93:24.12]Is it upside down?
[93:30.02]I think it just goes down here.
[93:31.32]I've just got to get them all in the same spot.
[93:39.00]These are kind of connected.
[93:40.28]Disconnected.
[93:42.24]Boom.
[93:42.34]Alright, get them in the middle.
[93:44.84]Get everything else out of the way.
[93:48.80]Shit, I'm never gonna fuckin' beat the, you can't do a puzzle in three hours fuckin' bullshit, am I?
[93:55.56]This is part of the orange one, which is up, actually, let me do this too.
[93:58.97]We got, lookit, we got this up here.
[94:00.91]I got this movin'.
[94:04.29]Once they're all up in the right spot, I'll probably be able to put these together pretty quickly.
[94:12.25]Okay, I know, pieces just dropped.
[94:14.63]Crap.
[94:21.22]Alright looking good This is kind of fun Oh, okay, uh, we weren't sure It's upside down
[94:52.99]Oh, wait, this might be over here.
[94:54.15]Oh, wait a minute.
[94:54.83]Hold on.
[94:55.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[94:56.63]This is definitely over here.
[94:57.87]Okay, because then there's the dragon right there.
[94:59.83]There's a dragon right here.
[95:24.20]okay this is right here yep is that fitting is that right there I can't tell I can't tell this too there are two orange castles it might even be upside down
[96:00.90]It's hard to tell.
[96:16.61]Sorry, I bumped you.
[96:18.19]You messed it up.
[96:20.48]Oh, hold on.
[96:22.54]God, doing puzzles is like, man, it's a workout!
[96:42.77]Alright.
[96:45.23]I'm going- I- I- this- I still gotta build from the top.
[96:47.85]Cause it's so clear, like where the hell- where the fuck is this piece?
[96:51.31]Where is this piece?
[96:53.09]This is like a cloud piece, but where- there are no cloud pieces in this room.
[97:02.83]Where the hell is this thing?
[97:05.55]Where's there?
[97:06.35]I'm missing three cloud pieces.
[97:13.56]Green dragon.
[97:15.98]Right there.
[97:19.12]Cloud piece.
[97:34.08]No, this is all grass.
[97:35.54]There's no clouds in here.
[97:36.44]Yeah, these are all like grass.
[98:01.20]Somebody like trying to place this piece like good fucking luck Okay, there are no more cloud pieces I swear to god I'm picking up every single piece individually until I find a cloud
[98:38.35]this kind of goes together but hey okay where's this where's this guy oh okay right in the middle right there okay so that's right above with drums it's right below this castle it's like down here somewhere
[99:19.11]When I lean forward, they all turn white.
[99:21.51]Because of the light.
[99:23.99]Hold on a second.
[99:35.47]Like 10 frames a second.
[99:39.00]That looks way worse for everybody now.
[99:48.47]The light is just, like, right here.
[99:50.23]So I leaned in, and it's just like... Do you fit here?
[100:06.45]I got a connection right there.
[100:10.51]He's really doing it.
[100:14.61]Oh, you better believe it, and I'm gonna get it.
[100:18.52]So this is the top of a pillar.
[100:21.22]I think it's in the middle over here.
[100:23.74]Alright, so this is going fine.
[100:25.18]There's a little bit more of this shit.
[100:28.18]This one's kind of blue.
[100:34.30]Once you get one major connection, like down here, you can see better.
[100:40.32]Okay, that looks good.
[100:45.24]That looks good, but it's not right.
[100:48.70]Somehow.
[100:50.62]At least 20 more minutes?
[100:51.64]Oh, at least... I would say two more hours.
[100:56.48]I'll get it, though.
[101:01.26]I think if I do this again, I'm going to move the table like three feet this way.
[101:07.45]Just to be able to see better.
[101:10.93]Where is this thing?
[101:13.49]A little dragon kind of hanging out.
[101:25.11]right there watch ready perfect absolutely perfect I just need that dragon's body and I think yeah another like cloud and mountain move this out of the way for now too I gotta have like a few different sections otherwise I'll never get it done
[102:01.75]Stay up there.
[102:06.21]What about the bottom row?
[102:07.19]The bottom row is now just a bunch of bushes.
[102:08.69]It'd be too hard.
[102:10.04]I guess I could do it like this.
[102:11.06]At least start it.
[102:12.54]Let me know if you see a bottom piece.
[102:19.76]That would be very helpful to get the bottom and the top.
[102:30.60]Separate all the side pieces?
[102:35.40]Probably a good idea.
[102:36.18]Alright, I was going to do some inventory, so let me do some separating.
[102:46.70]If I find a connection, I'll just do it.
[102:50.67]But at the very least, I need to get all the bottom pieces.
[102:57.90]Bottom.
[102:58.34]Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.
[103:02.86]Bottom.
[103:03.86]Well, this could be... This could be a side piece.
[103:07.58]These could be side pieces, too.
[103:09.02]For all I fucking know.
[103:09.98]Who knows?
[103:11.43]All the side pieces, unfortunately, in this one look identical.
[103:13.57]Because they're all bushes.
[103:16.87]So, I guess the only way you could tell is the side pieces here.
[103:20.77]They have, like, a guy there.
[103:22.81]But it's kind of hard to tell.
[103:23.82]It's all just a bunch of, like, bushes.
[103:27.81]Get there eventually, though.
[103:28.67]It's all about separating and moving things in the right direction.
[103:33.03]Let me see if I can find a side piece that connects to this.
[103:39.20]That would be very, very good.
[103:40.30]I think I got it right here.
[103:42.24]Fuck.
[103:43.16]Wait.
[103:43.36]No.
[103:50.12]Okay.
[103:56.05]okay um these guys are down here next to this dragon this other dragon's like right here I need a second table
[104:23.85]We're only doing corners.
[104:26.07]Or edges.
[104:29.55]We're gonna connect them all.
[104:31.29]Everything else is going up top for now.
[104:34.53]If it's bi- If I have more than two pieces connected, they stay.
[104:41.08]And I'm gonna try to put them in the right, like, kind of separate them into different kind of sections.
[104:49.38]If it's dragging, that's fine.
[104:51.22]I just need edges.
[104:55.19]edge okay that's fine that's fine that's fine that's fine that's fine that's fine that's fine this is an edge that's fine that's oh this is purple I think I just saw this one right here yeah look at edges first I did build some of this out already so that's fine all edges you're not an edge get out of the way
[105:45.61]Gonna take a minute.
[105:49.77]An edge?
[105:51.07]Hmm.
[105:52.37]Kinda.
[105:54.10]It's technically an edge.
[105:54.96]Some of these are technically edges.
[106:09.63]Remind me I have the red dragon in my pocket.
[106:11.53]Because I will forget.
[106:27.32]Okay.
[106:29.67]Beautiful.
[106:31.01]Very beautiful.
[106:38.97]These can stay together, because I just gotta piece this shit together.
[106:48.89]Then, once all the edges are done, we're gonna go top left, down to bottom right.
[106:53.17]That sounds insane, but you know what?
[106:55.21]We're doing it.
[106:58.66]edge no edge no edge just too much to look at you don't do it like this there's a three so there's three side pieces for the clown clouds that's a weird sentence okay okay okay
[107:32.20]Getting there.
[107:32.56]They're also over here.
[107:42.58]They're part of this green dragon, which is right here, so I'm gonna keep you there.
[107:47.00]Okay.
[107:47.24]I think I've got enough room here to start to make the edges.
[107:51.69]Get a few more of these out of the way.
[107:55.27]What are you guys doing?
[107:58.95]You guys having fun?
[108:01.59]ban that guy um okay I don't know what they did but I just banned him I guess okay okay okay how many times can you say okay before you okay actually okay do something okay
[108:22.81]hey it's time I've got this edge is this the correct edge it looks like there's a lot of these um soldiers of the spheres over here and this is a right edge piece so you don't get rid of those
[108:52.85]Right here?
[108:54.03]I think it's right there.
[108:58.81]Okay.
[109:00.57]Shit!
[109:02.07]Okay.
[109:02.21]I'm trying to start piecing them together.
[109:08.10]I need the corner!
[109:12.08]Ah!
[109:13.40]No!
[109:18.30]Or is this this lower left corner?
[109:24.84]hard to tell what corner it is but this okay they were like trees with trunks find trees with trunks
[110:44.01]Got it.
[110:44.39]Okay.
[110:45.77]Good.
[110:46.11]Alright, now let's start to fill it out.
[110:49.01]Come on.
[110:49.35]Let's go.
[110:49.77]Okay, I need bush.
[110:52.27]Kind of bush looking stuff.
[110:54.11]Bottom piece.
[110:56.24]Or this could even be a side piece.
[110:57.36]Something good?
[111:00.08]Nope.
[111:01.80]No.
[111:13.43]I need like two or three more pieces before I can make that distinction Those look like tree trunks to me
[111:43.72]Down here.
[111:44.12]I need another piece that has a tree trunk on the hook.
[111:52.34]What?
[111:53.44]Oh, that's so sad.
[111:54.72]That's not it.
[112:06.93]They're all the same color.
[112:24.94]damn it it's just green green green green green green green bush I didn't put away how's the puzzle going it's gone it's gone
[112:52.19]I'm having trouble with the outline.
[112:54.91]Because it seems like every single piece of the outline is the same piece.
[113:03.77]But, you know, gotta do what you gotta do.
[113:11.32]You are smart.
[113:12.02]Hey.
[113:14.12]Thanks.
[113:15.74]It's gonna be a piece in my pocket, I guarantee it.
[113:17.78]Wouldn't be surprised.
[113:33.97]Even the ones that feel like they should fit, they just don't.
[113:38.31]I feel like this is the worst thing to do right now.
[113:40.09]Where are the cloud pieces?
[113:50.38]Find me these last two cloud pieces.
[113:52.22]Because, oh my god, it's driving me crazy.
[113:55.40]We need right here.
[113:57.98]right see right this mountain I just need mountain and clouds green mountain and clouds where is it in your pockets there's a lot in here there's so many
[114:30.23]oh the misery found the peace to my puzzle tree I need one more piece up there um it's clouds and a mountain
[115:01.04]Well, I was in a mountain.
[115:01.68]Let's see if it's in my pocket.
[115:02.64]If that, I'll be happy.
[115:03.72]I must have two full rows.
[115:06.16]Just gets way easier from here on out.
[115:09.80]Whatever.
[115:13.46]Wait.
[115:14.72]No.
[115:41.28]Oh, there's a dragon on this castle down here.
[115:44.66]Oh, dude.
[115:49.79]That's fucked up.
[115:50.69]Do you think they're going to be okay?
[115:53.33]I think it goes over there.
[116:14.77]Fucking grass.
[116:19.29]Alright.
[116:19.91]I'm gonna... I gotta try to build one of these.
[116:22.07]Because I have to connect this shit.
[116:23.47]This is probably the most able to be connected.
[116:26.61]I need the peak of this building on the right.
[116:29.77]I need the peak.
[116:30.51]Because that peak is right next to this dragon's face.
[116:35.73]See the peak right here?
[116:37.92]It's probably hard for you to see it, but it's right there.
[116:40.64]I need this there.
[116:48.19]let's see if I can get it done it's gonna be the peak then a little bit more maybe a little mountain on the side for a peak peak of the of the temple over here it's orange
[117:19.79]Wait.
[117:21.15]Okay, this is good.
[117:22.06]This is good.
[117:22.46]This is good.
[117:24.42]Down to the third row.
[117:32.91]You can see, like, a little washed out over here, but I assure you it's looking good.
[117:40.67]Okay, now it's time to build this down, and now it's... Okay.
[117:43.69]Here we go.
[117:50.32]Let me get that.
[117:51.06]It's like the bottom little rung of the... Shit.
[118:04.59]Come on.
[118:04.77]Hey!
[118:07.23]Alright.
[118:08.91]Coming down.
[118:10.91]Coming down.
[118:12.47]See?
[118:12.77]Look, I'll put some... Take the glare off for a second so you can see.
[118:17.10]I'm just knocked over the fucking soda.
[118:20.63]Go faster.
[118:31.25]Accidental piece just got made.
[118:33.55]Dude, call clip that.
[118:34.93]You should clip that.
[118:36.03]I didn't even do that.
[118:36.95]You should clip that.
[118:37.63]That was fucking crazy.
[118:40.05]I didn't even mean to do that.
[118:42.65]And I got one.
[118:43.25]Okay.
[118:47.57]What is this one doing?
[118:51.26]like this it's hard to tell the orientation here okay alright I need this peak is that it right there it is you see look at that we have it's almost looking good over on this side you know if we're in this table here
[119:23.50]Take a look.
[119:24.32]We're doing well.
[119:25.70]I need this part right here.
[119:29.28]A little more this way.
[119:36.34]This kind of builds out.
[119:37.63]This, to me, is over here.
[119:40.35]Any more orange that you guys can see?
[119:49.33]Again, hard to tell.
[120:03.06]What is right here?
[120:04.46]Okay, this is the dragon.
[120:06.93]Dragon right there.
[120:08.17]And then this spot.
[120:10.35]So I'm looking for the dragon tail.
[120:12.69]And then a little connecting spot over there.
[120:14.95]Little dragon tail.
[120:21.05]Streamer is old.
[120:22.19]Yeah, getting there.
[120:24.33]Getting there.
[120:31.34]Okay, this is up there.
[120:34.34]Next to the shaft of that thing.
[120:36.34]Not quite.
[120:49.50]We need the rest of this mountain.
[120:51.84]So I need a blue mountain.
[120:57.28]Yep.
[120:57.66]Okay.
[120:58.08]Good.
[120:59.88]Need the rest of this mountain over here.
[121:06.41]Feeding up a little.
[121:07.05]This is part of this.
[121:10.25]This is part of this.
[121:14.11]Hard to tell.
[121:14.71]Hard to tell.
[121:24.07]Side piece.
[121:27.22]You could probably make this dragon.
[121:30.32]He's going like this.
[121:39.88]Yeah, he's gonna be a little too weird I feel like the pieces are just so cut so strangely for that dragon that I'm gonna wait
[122:03.54]I'm working on over here.
[122:04.31]Get the green out of here.
[122:12.05]Alright.
[122:14.05]Dude.
[122:14.17]What the fuck is happening over here?
[122:20.08]I hate it.
[122:20.46]There's so many of these soldiers.
[122:23.00]They could be anywhere.
[122:26.08]I can't like a couple of them have like a fucking blue hat on or something so I can actually tell what's going on here.
[122:49.19]God damn it.
[122:50.07]How does this not fit?
[122:51.61]How many fucking people are there?
[122:55.82]There's only like three pieces that have people on them.
[123:09.02]Where's this guy?
[123:10.20]This guy's riding the dragon.
[123:11.60]I don't give a shit about any of that.
[123:14.81]Here's what we're gonna do.
[123:22.88]I need this tip.
[123:38.82]Hold on, I have some extra tickets.
[123:40.30]Can you still count these?
[123:41.54]Getting close to being able to put that up because this is part of the big shaft that's right there.
[124:04.36]top and then a cloud so that's the top of this I need a piece that connects I need like the crown like the crown piece that has all coming out of the top and that will be starting to look good alright looking for the crown this is up here the drums
[124:35.40]I have no idea what this one is.
[124:39.76]It's up here.
[124:44.00]Love this song.
[124:45.94]Katamari's got some really great music.
[124:47.32]It's probably top five.
[124:51.39]Best.
[124:56.25]Best soundtracks ever, I think.
[124:58.43]For a video game.
[125:02.01]It's going to be such trial and error with these ones.
[125:07.24]I don't even know if that is correct.
[125:10.14]That's not correct, right?
[125:11.14]No.
[125:12.20]This is not right, is it?
[125:16.22]I don't think so.
[125:20.28]I've only connected one of these so far.
[125:28.13]Right, okay.
[125:28.59]This is right here.
[125:30.99]Very close.
[125:31.81]Right here.
[125:39.84]I really need your energy right now.
[125:41.06]I hope I didn't hurt you.
[125:49.09]I'm just saying.
[125:49.81]I'm just trying to give you a little bit of extra electricity.
[125:58.57]That person like blew that person back through their back wall.
[126:06.60]Tail?
[126:07.46]Tail.
[126:07.74]This has to be this tail, right?
[126:37.34]tail like this the top of the tree down here right where is this oh squeaks right
[127:06.58]What's up?
[127:07.18]Thanks Squeaks.
[127:07.84]Welcome everybody.
[127:10.00]We're doing a puzzle today.
[127:11.06]Jigsaw puzzle.
[127:12.56]It's a chill stream where I just hang out.
[127:15.67]Do a puzzle.
[127:16.99]We're having a grand time.
[127:18.73]Having a good time.
[127:21.03]Squeaks.
[127:21.81]Hey.
[127:25.11]Thank you.
[127:28.37]Bottom right is Dragontail.
[127:30.03]Bottom right Dragontail.
[127:31.67]Bottom right Dragontail.
[127:36.12]You mean right here?
[127:38.60]That's not the tail.
[127:39.62]That's not this dragon's tail.
[127:44.49]What is this?
[127:45.45]Is it?
[127:46.43]Why is this thing so fucking strange?
[127:51.63]Is that...
[128:17.95]It's the wing tip?
[128:22.31]Oh shit, it's not a tail?
[128:24.95]It's, yeah, it's right here.
[128:27.01]It's the tip.
[128:27.75]I thought it was his tail.
[128:30.56]Shit.
[128:31.06]Okay, well, thank you.
[128:32.44]We got it.
[128:33.30]We're good.
[128:33.62]Okay.
[128:36.64]I'm happy.
[128:37.30]We're good.
[128:38.48]Okay.
[128:39.10]I still need that tail.
[128:41.88]There's still a tail piece.
[128:44.84]I don't know what the hell that is.
[128:45.68]Alright.
[128:47.30]What do we got in here?
[128:50.04]This is still kind of messed up, but whatever.
[128:54.43]He's also cheating on the puzzle.
[128:56.35]I want the Squeaksers to tell me, how do you do a puzzle?
[129:00.47]How do you guys do a puzzle?
[129:02.15]When you take the puzzle out of the box... Hold on.
[129:06.13]Let me not get made fun of.
[129:08.19]When you take the puzzle out of the box, you set the box up and just... Oh, there it is.
[129:13.33]Let's see where it is.
[129:14.43]Let's see what you do.
[129:15.47]How would you ever do... If you didn't know what the picture was, how would you do the puzzle?
[129:21.33]That sounds like a real shit time to me.
[129:27.68]I'm actually making some pretty good progress here.
[129:32.14]Alright, where's Green Dragon?
[129:37.62]No, I need the top of that.
[129:39.34]I need the top of that shaft.
[129:42.41]This right, you see what I'm talking about?
[129:44.19]I need the piece that connects these here.
[129:46.01]There's one more piece that goes right there and connects these two together.
[129:51.87]Find it.
[129:54.77]Do not disappoint me.
[130:15.66]Hey.
[130:20.54]Alright.
[130:28.41]Green dragon.
[130:31.27]This is the tail.
[130:32.39]This is the tail.
[130:49.38]Is that one piece every 25 minutes?
[131:03.25]It'll be done in about three weeks.
[131:09.93]I need... What are you saying?
[131:17.49]This is the hard part.
[131:18.31]Once the hard part is over, we get to the easy part.
[131:26.19]These are all soldiers that have... Believe.
[131:33.80]Okay.
[131:41.23]Can't do anything with these right now.
[131:48.18]of that pillar.
[131:57.20]Fuck, everything looks the same.
[132:02.96]Here.
[132:03.82]At least I'm putting all those pieces up there and I'll be able to find them very easily.
[132:07.22]Green dragon.
[132:11.38]Don't really know.
[132:12.24]Can't tell.
[132:12.76]Kind of a green mix.
[132:16.59]I think it's down here.
[132:21.32]Bottom piece.
[132:23.84]Oh boy, what the fuck is that?
[132:27.17]Ooh, wait a minute.
[132:28.57]This is a... This is a trees.
[132:31.85]Two trees.
[132:32.81]That's three trees.
[132:34.21]Three trees is over here on the left.
[132:36.67]Yep.
[132:40.13]That looks like right there.
[132:42.81]Doesn't it?
[132:44.58]There.
[132:44.96]That's right below a spear guy.
[132:50.33]It's like right over here somewhere, I'll deal with that later.
[132:52.33]Fuck!
[133:09.19]Crap!
[133:13.14]Clear guy.
[133:13.64]Yep, they're aiming this way.
[133:20.66]I don't know what this is.
[133:21.74]Stripes?
[133:24.44]He's got stripes.
[133:25.06]I think there's a kind of flying machine up here.
[133:29.48]Like here somewhere.
[133:30.38]This looks like an edge.
[133:38.08]Another spear guy.
[133:38.95]I might have to actually put the spear guys together before doing anything else.
[133:45.75]This looks like 500.
[133:47.17]It's supposed to be three.
[133:52.08]I don't know.
[133:52.56]I have no idea what the fuck that is.
[133:55.93]I have no idea what the fuck that is.
[133:57.95]I have no idea what that is.
[133:58.87]I have no idea what these are.
[134:02.41]I have no idea what that is.
[134:04.27]I have absolutely no idea what that is.
[134:06.41]I have no idea what this is.
[134:07.39]I don't know.
[134:13.15]Dragon.
[134:13.55]More spear guys on this side I think.
[134:20.84]I don't know.
[134:21.74]I think it's in the middle here.
[134:22.74]Let's put it up here.
[134:24.18]There's a roof to one of these.
[134:35.65]Did Evolution forget to have you recognize a pattern?
[134:40.31]I want you to look at all the green on the bottom and all the green on the edge and all the green on this edge.
[134:50.61]Where does that go?
[134:54.95]Smarty pants.
[134:56.69]It could go over here.
[134:57.37]It could go down here.
[134:59.61]It could go on the... Now you made me angry and I punched you.
[135:08.74]The bottom somewhere?
[135:09.62]Yeah, I don't know.
[135:10.28]Too much fucking green.
[135:13.80]Where's all the reds and the oranges and the blues?
[135:20.91]Alright, well that's all the pieces.
[135:21.93]So... I'm gonna do a fun thing called... Find the fuckin' top!
[135:53.46]over here I think this is actually over here the color difference is minuscule you're stressing me out go take a walk
[136:25.71]wait now where is that this is the dragon's head but there's a bunch of spear people right below there's a guy standing there and then at the left here at 19. it's kind of hard like all the architecture is so angular that it's
[136:59.50]very clearly there's a dragon's face red dragon's like mouth I need to like alright remind me when I do this again I need a second table because I need a table for pieces and then a table to like place pieces because right now I am like paving the road and driving on it at the same time
[137:32.20]I think I can start to do this, though.
[137:34.54]Because I have enough of the spear guys, I think, to start to build this.
[137:41.50]Because I have a ton of it over here.
[137:42.60]Alright, let's try to get this done.
[137:46.33]At least the spear part.
[137:47.27]Pretty sick.
[137:47.81]Good.
[137:48.11]Good.
[138:01.48]Spear, spear, spear.
[138:06.58]Why does it fit perfectly and it's not correct?
[138:08.44]I feel like it fits perfectly.
[138:10.56]I don't think that's not right.
[138:17.61]Where is that?
[138:28.19]That's right.
[138:29.45]Is it?
[138:31.42]Okay.
[138:34.78]There's a sphere right here.
[138:35.72]Okay.
[138:40.34]Cool.
[138:44.87]There is a guy standing.
[138:48.75]Okay.
[139:01.90]lighting is killing me it's killing me too I don't know why it's just so glossy it's like I have to like go like this to see them it's like they've painted with like a shellac
[139:37.34]Make him nice and shiny for me.
[139:42.02]Is this a spear?
[139:47.58]Oh, we still got Katamari going, right?
[139:48.78]Okay.
[140:05.87]Let me move this.
[140:07.55]I wonder if I were to go like... That kind of helped me.
[140:23.00]I don't know if that helped you at all, but that helped me.
[140:26.85]Did that help you at all?
[140:33.39]Is it better better?
[140:36.97]Still hard to see these ones.
[140:40.17]But that helped me.
[140:41.69]So I'm going to continue using it.
[140:43.55]Okay.
[140:44.13]I can actually see now.
[140:45.26]That's amazing.
[140:45.94]Okay, hold on.
[140:48.84]It helps you even more.
[140:52.44]Yeah, I didn't really get a good puzzle that had come up on stream well.
[140:56.24]Because there's just so much going on.
[140:57.94]But I think you can get the gist of it.
[141:00.34]Once it starts to spread out a little more.
[141:01.80]Okay.
[141:05.20]Let's go back to the shields.
[141:15.42]green dragon so many shield guys can one of these connect to here that would be amazing that would start to help out so much this is a good puzzle yeah that's it's good so far it's definitely challenging enough fun enough that
[141:41.55]Like all the way down here.
[141:43.81]Yeah, this one's like deep over this way.
[141:46.16]Right there.
[141:50.86]Hmm.
[142:12.61]My hands look perfect, but the pieces look terrible.
[142:14.93]Okay.
[142:18.34]Oh, this other camera did not like that at all.
[142:19.84]You gonna watch more videos?
[142:25.05]I wanna do the- I wanna eat mac and cheese, dude.
[142:26.79]I got a lot.
[142:27.35]I can show you some of the boxes I got.
[142:36.77]Another one of those.
[142:37.47]I almost have all of the shield guys.
[142:40.76]I know you can't really see it that well, but I promise you they're almost done over here.
[142:52.55]No...
[143:05.27]It's hard to tell where this even is.
[143:15.26]It's like, they go like a line down here surrounded by fucking green!
[143:26.29]Two guys stand at the very end.
[143:31.91]I can see the little bits.
[143:44.87]Try that for a little while.
[143:46.53]I think that actually makes it better.
[143:47.67]A little bit.
[143:49.13]Maybe the angle that you could come down.
[143:52.47]Maybe this will help.
[144:00.52]Better angle.
[144:01.44]Maybe you can see a little better now.
[144:13.32]Should have done all the sides first.
[144:15.10]Okay.
[144:16.18]Alright, stop.
[144:16.78]This is what happens when you get stuck and you don't do anything.
[144:19.82]You get stuck and then you just don't do anything.
[144:21.33]You get stuck.
[144:22.53]I need to take a sip and then I'm going to continue.
[144:31.03]Ooh.
[144:36.40]Fucking flipped the whole thing.
[144:39.12]Just...
[144:45.58]A lot of colors.
[144:48.82]Where am I going?
[144:51.80]I need that.

[153:20.72]Bye-bye!
[153:24.88]Oh, finally!
[153:26.42]Finally!

[153:34.78]Should've done that an hour ago.
[153:36.40]God, I fucking hate this guy.
[153:38.70]What are you doing here?
[153:42.33]You could be fucking writing a book report.
[153:45.63]You could be playing Fortnite.
[153:47.61]You could be shoveling dirt for fun.
[153:51.49]I don't know.
[153:52.07]You could do whatever you want.
[154:03.22]What
[154:22.17]calling it right now he's not gonna finish it he's gonna like get mad he's gonna just like be 40 done he's gonna be like guys okay it's been like two and a half hours like I'm done I'll see you in like three months that's definitely what he's gonna do
[154:58.35]Okay.
[155:01.05]So here's what we're going to do guys.
[155:05.80]I'm huddling up.
[155:06.96]I'm about to like coach little league.
[155:10.90]Okay.
[155:11.32]So I think what's going to happen is we're going to go for a double play.
[155:15.08]You know what a double play is?
[155:27.41]I've touched the same piece like 30 times.
[155:29.95]I'm so sick of touching that piece.
[155:32.44]And it's not even accurate.
[155:34.58]I melded it, I bent it to my will and it's not even working anymore for me.
[155:52.35]know it's painful for me to do this but I gotta get the left edge I've gotta get it and I keep looking at it and I keep going I hate it but I have to do it I have to finish that part oh there's gotta be more pieces over here
[156:19.56]are all bottoms maybe?
[156:20.86]I don't know.
[156:21.68]It's so hard to tell which is a bottom and which is a left or a right.
[156:24.82]I don't know.
[156:26.42]I don't know.
[156:27.00]I don't know.
[156:29.22]I'm starting to turn into Bugleberry.
[156:32.76]I know.
[156:33.30]I'm starting to get problems with what I'm doing.
[156:35.84]I haven't seen Bugleberry in a long time, have I?
[156:40.66]I wonder what he's up to.
[156:53.50]Is that it?
[156:56.80]I don't think so.
[156:59.86]I think that's like the middle part.
[157:26.30]Oh, it's down here.
[157:28.16]Hey!
[157:31.86]And... Does this fit?
[157:37.97]No.
[157:38.11]Oh, sorry.
[157:38.95]Different sphere guy on the left side.
[157:43.89]We're getting there.
[157:48.08]Okay, I'm going to use the housing rod to find the piece.
[157:56.80]Bingo.
[157:57.30]Bingo.
[158:11.09]Down here.
[158:13.17]Slowly but surely.
[158:14.41]This is one of those slow but sure puzzles.
[158:16.25]It's like a bunch of shit.
[158:22.19]Okay, I could sit here and just like make excuses.
[158:25.17]I will sit here for like an hour and be like, this is the reason why I don't want to do this.
[158:28.96]Not don't want to do it, but this is why I'm having trouble with this puzzle.
[158:31.72]This is the reason for this.
[158:32.78]And this is the reason for this.
[158:33.88]And this is what I have to say about this.
[158:37.61]Alright.
[158:40.35]That is...
[158:52.24]Up there.
[158:55.83]Ah!
[158:57.81]There's a little snake coming out of there top right.
[159:02.55]Looks to be... Where are these trees?
[159:13.54]Is this blue?
[159:16.22]Oh, fuck!
[159:16.74]That's right in the middle.
[159:18.87]It's right there.
[159:21.74]I keep finding these middle pieces.
[159:23.12]It's not going to help me.
[159:33.61]It's not right.
[159:44.21]How could there not be like 10 of these just right here?
[159:47.57]I can't see them.
[159:49.09]I don't know where they are.
[159:49.78]Where are they?
[160:03.35]There's a whole house here.
[160:04.49]You got old man sight.
[160:07.91]Oh, the music's over.
[160:08.55]What else we got?
[160:10.64]You guys want to do a new poll for music?
[160:16.40]Anything you feel like?
[160:17.04]I don't want to go this way.
[160:24.77]I want to go that way.
[160:30.27]This is so close to being connected.
[160:32.39]It's not even funny.
[160:34.85]There's one line here of guys holding spears facing this way.
[160:49.27]Fuck.
[160:56.56]These guys are down here.
[160:59.96]Guys are down here.
[161:00.88]These guys are... I think they're right there.
[161:20.19]What the fuck are you talking about?
[161:26.31]How does that not go there?
[161:29.15]That does not go there?
[161:31.35]It doesn't go there.
[161:34.73]That is shocking.
[161:38.11]It doesn't go here either.
[161:40.59]Yes, it does.
[161:42.64]Shocking.
[161:46.22]There it is.
[161:48.94]Okay.
[161:54.02]Playing Resident Evil 4, it's a good game.
[161:55.60]Alright, what are we putting on?
[162:05.79]I'm good?
[162:06.17]Hollow Knight?
[162:18.32]That's a good one.
[162:19.16]I'll do Hollow Knight.
[162:24.96]Okay.
[162:34.92]Vegas steaks no not right now alright I'm ready now I just have to get this side and I'm I'll be very I'll be really happy so it looks like art with the dragon's head
[163:02.74]Start with the dragon's head right there.
[163:06.70]There.
[163:06.92]So that dragon's head, there's a guy standing next to the dragon.
[163:11.81]So there's a guy that's just going like this.
[163:16.96]Just need to find that guy standing there like this.
[163:20.38]Where is he?
[163:36.73]You He's like
[164:05.87]what is it oh yeah this thing what is it alright now we need because I can connect these if I can get the guy standing there it's like the kind of flying machine thing
[164:33.78]That's not correct, but... No, it is, is it?
[164:38.29]No, but close enough.
[164:44.29]Fuck.
[164:47.53]I've been swearing a lot today.
[164:48.65]I'm going to pull back on the swearing.
[164:54.15]Another one down here.
[164:55.13]This is starting... Once I can connect any of these, this is going to get really easy.
[165:01.00]question is like getting all these I got like eight pieces here nine pieces here 16 pieces connected here they just need to and then I can and then I can and then I can and then I can very very quickly right after that
[165:31.61]Is it the flying machine?
[165:42.78]This guy's riding a dragon.
[165:48.16]This dragon is down here.
[165:53.01]So that's a whole fucking other thing I gotta do.
[165:58.78]Where is he?
[165:59.38]I just need him and I can connect him.
[166:01.48]Come on, where are you?
[166:07.90]Another shield guy connected down here.
[166:10.17]You can't even see it.
[166:12.25]But I assure you there is a lot of progress happening down here.
[166:16.79]You just can't see it.
[166:18.77]You'll see when it connects.
[166:26.83]Okay, I got a huge connection down here.
[166:29.25]This is monstrous.
[166:32.16]This is monstrous.
[166:33.14]I wish you could see it.
[166:33.92]It's absolutely monstrous.
[166:35.86]You know what?
[166:36.52]I want you to see it.
[166:37.90]Okay.
[166:55.65]Okay.
[166:57.59]Here is this group here.
[166:58.71]These are all the shield guys.
[167:13.02]Too much shit on the screen.
[167:13.98]Okay, now can I connect this to something?
[167:20.23]Can I connect this to something here?
[167:30.12]Screen?
[167:30.56]What about it?
[167:30.94]Did he play Sekiro like this?
[167:37.13]I beat Sekiro on stream.
[167:46.51]And he hated every second of it?
[167:48.87]I didn't hate every second of it.
[167:51.97]I'd say just maybe like some parts of it.
[167:55.23]That's good.
[167:55.93]This is coming along down here.
[167:59.10]This is coming along down here very well.
[168:00.53]And I think... Okay.
[168:07.45]Hold on now.
[168:09.17]This is right here.
[168:12.39]Shit.
[168:15.31]Okay, I need... I need something right here.
[168:21.15]All this is so close to each other.
[168:25.25]It's like right... It's like this.
[168:29.03]How to get the most of Grammarly free.
[168:31.35]It's on behalf of Grammarly to tell you all about the free version of the best communication assistant in the world.
[168:37.40]Millions have chosen to go beyond their default grammar checkers and use Grammarly.
[168:41.92]My cousin Izzy, a graphic designer, is one of them.
[168:45.44]Izzy loves how quick and reliable Grammarly is at providing feedback.
[168:49.15]Another reason Izzy signed up for Grammarly is its conciseness suggestions, something she wasn't getting from default grammar checkers.
[168:56.27]Grammarly notices
[168:57.63]I don't know what dragon this is, but it's a dragon.
[168:59.61]I'm going to have to move all this out of the middle, unfortunately.
[169:03.51]I might actually be able to do some of that now.
[169:35.01]Just trying to separate out until I can get rid of most of the ones that are very clearly not any of these connected Way down There
[170:00.20]Come on.
[170:05.76]Give me a break.
[170:11.79]I'm really surprised it does not fit.
[170:15.33]So surprised, in fact, that it does fit here.
[170:21.51]You're just spinning pieces around.
[170:28.06]We just fell over that way.
[170:31.85]Boom!
[170:32.51]Oh my god, that would have been bad.
[170:33.77]This is... Where's this little... I can probably place this.
[170:45.32]Down here, lower left.
[170:46.50]Okay, so pretty close to the edge.
[170:49.56]And there's like a weird... Mound.
[170:51.96]Connecting to... Is that it?
[171:02.89]Are you going to smash your own skull accidentally?
[171:08.09]Yeah.
[171:08.49]It happens.
[171:09.72]It happens.
[171:12.66]OK.
[171:13.70]Almost ready to connect.
[171:43.70]Tale of this one up here.
[171:50.02]There's a lot of progress on the right side.
[172:02.84]I cover it, you can get a good idea.
[172:04.16]We got almost this whole castle here done, and almost this one too.
[172:10.68]The middle one should be the easiest part.
[172:12.06]Shit.
[172:27.18]do you have to say about that you're a funny man um I think that comedy is very subjective and the things that I say you might not think are funny but maybe you do I don't really necessarily even think I'm like a funny person I just like to make up and say it out loud that's pretty much it
[172:53.07]I like to write too.
[172:53.83]A lot of stuff I do with off-brand is writing.
[172:57.45]Kind of just like, oh, hey, we're doing this thing.
[172:59.43]Alright, let me come up with some stuff or let me come up with like a concept or like a pitch.
[173:03.26]So that's a lot of that.
[173:07.29]I love making pitches.
[173:08.85]I love, you know, the... They call them the, like, the one-to-three pagers.
[173:12.41]Where you just kind of write exactly what the show is.
[173:16.69]Kind of be like, this is what I want to see, and this is what I want to look like, this is the jokes, and this is what I want to do.
[173:22.04]I have so much fun doing those that, yeah, I get to kind of do that for a living now.
[173:26.90]Which is really, really awesome.
[173:28.50]I'm very excited.
[173:35.09]Where is this spear guy?
[173:40.46]I can't believe it doesn't fit.
[173:51.03]That one does.
[173:53.27]Ah!
[173:54.41]Getting closer.
[173:55.35]Being in.
[173:57.69]Oh, not quite there.
[174:01.72]Behind you?
[174:02.18]What?
[174:14.66]One more guy standing facing that way.
[174:18.89]And then I should be able to connect them.
[174:20.41]Make sure it's not in here.
[174:26.69]Wait.
[174:26.95]Where is that motherfucker?
[174:39.02]Oh no, this is like the camp.
[174:42.38]Nope.
[174:46.39]Yeah, that's the king right in the middle.
[175:31.76]Found the king.
[175:32.28]Found another piece of the king over here.
[175:38.80]You don't even see it.
[175:39.38]This puzzle is like 19% done.
[175:51.83]Well, I think it's like 50%.
[176:00.68]I think it's like 50% done, just in different stages.
[176:06.51]But once you get the actual snap, like, then you can start to go, oh, that goes there, that goes there.
[176:12.79]It's a question of getting the annoying parts done.
[176:27.55]There.
[176:30.88]What?
[176:31.54]Damn it.
[176:34.42]God damn it.
[177:05.99]Ah!
[177:36.76]Where is this guy with the standing on the thing?
[177:40.04]This goddamn puzzle is green.
[177:45.28]That's not even correct.
[178:09.05]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[178:10.51]This is not correct either.
[178:11.51]You're taking as long as possible to complete it.
[178:27.78]I am assuring you right now that this is difficult.
[178:32.97]This is not an easy puzzle.
[178:35.84]It said intermediate grades 7 through 10 on the box.
[178:53.58]This is one of those puzzles where everything looks the same.
[178:56.68]So maybe I really should just build out the edges.
[179:01.38]But I could get a really great connection right here.
[179:03.74]But
[179:07.62]What?
[179:07.92]Wait a minute.
[179:10.04]Get in there.
[179:18.52]That feels like it doesn't... That feels like it's... I'm forcing it in there.
[179:21.72]Is that forcing it in?
[179:25.76]This one right here?
[179:29.03]No.
[179:29.29]No, that's it.
[179:29.83]That's it.
[179:30.19]Alright.
[179:30.49]Thank God.
[179:31.11]That felt like it didn't fit before.
[179:33.57]Oh my goodness.
[179:34.27]Alright.
[179:34.49]Now we can connect this one.
[179:41.14]No.
[179:43.69]Shit!
[179:47.09]I'm not yelling either.
[179:51.39]Shit!
[179:59.68]Let him cook.
[180:00.36]Yeah, I'm still cooking.
[180:02.04]And I got this now.
[180:03.02]Hold on.
[180:04.69]There's a little bit of space here.
[180:05.89]And there's the flying machine.
[180:08.63]So I need... Oh god, it's like all green.
[180:12.62]It's just completely green.
[180:26.87]Shit's all green.
[180:44.45]Is it over here?
[180:46.19]I didn't know.
[180:47.29]No?
[180:47.75]No?
[180:47.85]Oh, it's not cooking?
[180:53.63]Kind of.
[180:53.91]Should've probably got a seat, too.
[181:02.80]I thought standing was gonna be... It's not.
[181:06.76]Alright.
[181:07.82]So.
[181:10.38]What do we got?
[181:13.47]I am shocked that I cannot find whatever pieces need to finish this.
[181:17.13]It's like, it's remarkable.
[181:20.08]Where the hell are these pieces?
[181:24.63]If they're on the ground, I'm putting a hole in my monitor.
[182:02.08]I got it
[183:36.54]so so
[184:12.43]Shit!
[184:13.73]I'm so sorry, I have a lot of saliva in my mouth.
[184:16.83]Shit!
[184:21.43]I still, alightly, cannot find the rest of these people's spirits.
[184:34.14]There's a whole line over here.
[184:40.74]I almost have the left side down here.
[184:41.93]Alright, let's just find the side.
[184:46.41]This is like kind of... What else is down here?
[184:54.03]below okay I know what I'm doing to the right of this spear guy one two three four we got one two three four the right of the spear guy is the wing of the red dragon I'm gonna try to build that out from here it's like the end of the wing of the red dragon and the red dragon's wing is blue
[185:23.85]So, let's go ahead and do that.
[185:28.41]That will help.
[185:29.15]Is this a red dragon?
[185:34.23]A lot of red dragons.
[185:36.68]Is this a red dragon?
[185:37.60]Is this a red dragon?
[185:44.66]Red dragon?
[185:45.28]Red dragon?
[185:45.92]Red dragon?
[185:49.70]Um...
[185:59.77]Red Dragon's wing.
[186:01.57]Okay.
[186:05.52]Start that process.
[186:07.42]There it is.
[186:13.16]Right here.
[186:18.62]Red Dragon.
[186:21.56]I believe so.
[186:31.70]The red one looks, this red place looks tasty.
[187:03.67]uh uh
[187:33.70]Is this some high level gameplay?
[187:36.52]I think it is.
[187:36.98]Definitely a high level something.
[187:44.64]Awkward pieces.
[187:45.34]Fucking red dragon.
[187:47.63]He's like all over the place.
[187:54.17]There's huge wings.
[187:57.27]Like some of them are completely blown out like this.
[187:59.87]Okay.
[188:00.11]I think I got a lot of it.
[188:06.32]Is he on drugs?
[188:08.38]I'm just doing a puzzle.
[188:15.57]I'm not like, oh, you know what, man?
[188:17.07]I think I'm going to take out a lot of drugs and then stream today.
[188:21.27]That sounds like a great idea.
[188:22.79]Let me just get as fucked up as possible.
[188:27.59]Oh, because it's this way.
[188:28.87]Okay.
[188:51.93]gotta line up like these things but there we go how big is this wing it's huge this is ridiculous this guy's huge he's way bigger than the picture
[189:27.98]You know, if I was working on a jigsaw puzzle for three hours, I wouldn't be sober for it.
[189:40.69]I mean... Am I crazy?
[190:07.95]he's almost done yeah this does not fit here feels like it should body okay so it's down there it's part of the tail pull up the picture
[190:39.16]Okay, so that was the tail.
[190:40.82]I need the top.
[190:41.38]There's like a spiky part of his head up here.
[190:45.40]I just saw it.
[190:46.16]Where was it?
[190:46.62]There it is.
[190:49.26]Ooh, feels good.
[190:50.36]Alright.
[190:52.28]Now... This needs to connect to here.
[191:00.49]Getting there.
[191:04.75]Little piece of the wing.
[191:10.95]Alright.
[191:11.27]I think we've made our connection.
[191:12.83]I think I can do it.
[191:19.60]Not quite.
[191:20.24]It's right on the end of the top part.
[191:24.38]So this is... I got it right here, I think.
[191:26.56]I think this is it.
[191:28.32]Okay.
[191:36.27]Yes!
[191:38.79]Now!
[191:47.37]Dragon.
[191:48.45]Red dragon.
[191:51.87]People with the pole arms.
[191:54.01]This castle up here.
[191:56.91]I got the whole top row.
[191:57.97]It ends right here.
[191:59.89]Coming down this way.
[192:00.83]This is where the other castle is.
[192:02.01]I got this other dragon here.
[192:10.92]That's why he's the goat.
[192:14.90]You know, I will say...
[192:17.99]It's super, like, charming.
[192:19.47]That... That's so cute.
[192:22.11]That's... That's so cute.
[192:25.04]Saying that... I don't know.
[192:26.22]That's just funny.
[192:26.88]I like that.
[192:29.92]Monday morning.
[192:30.94]Monday at 3 p.m.
[192:32.10]Did we get everybody think positive thoughts about me?
[192:38.36]Can you imagine somebody, like, on fucking, like, TikTok live?
[192:41.76]That's where I see that.
[192:43.49]I see that on, like, Instagram live.
[192:45.95]Like, guys, it's 3 o'clock.
[192:48.05]Where's the positive thoughts?
[192:53.91]I feel like I don't feel it.
[192:55.79]Okay.
[193:02.80]Close?
[193:04.38]Not close at all.
[193:05.02]There's quite a bit left.
[193:07.68]Where do I go from here?
[193:09.14]Above the dragon, maybe?
[193:11.50]Above the dragon's wing is...
[193:16.84]that thing right above the wing there's a little bit of bush that thing that's connected to the other dragon so I think I have that it's right here right perfect better
[193:49.42]see part of the green dragon I could try to build green dragon the gray dragon's like up there actually that might be good to do I'm doing that yeah forget about this I got what I want to do over here pretty nicely let's go ahead
[194:16.36]Do you have Elmer's glue?
[194:17.92]Um, I don't, but I'll make sure I paint it so it can stay together.
[194:23.66]Okay.
[194:26.29]I'm doing Green Dragon at the top.
[194:27.95]Green Dragon goes right here.
[194:31.81]And let's just start putting pieces over there.
[194:35.93]Shellac.
[194:46.94]Alright, what does he look like?
[194:48.02]He's got two big wings spread out like that.
[194:53.78]That looks right there.
[195:20.45]I feel like that's better.
[195:21.35]Am I crazy or is that better?
[195:24.19]I feel like I'm sitting on an iPod 12.
[195:28.90]Superior?
[195:29.98]Way better this way?
[195:50.75]hey look at that I think that's better just the only thing is the shellac is over here now but that's okay better is it lotion on the ground
[196:35.74]it's gonna be like shellacked on some of them I just I can't stop the light from coming through like that I don't know why it's picking it up like that though it's bizarre I guess I could like if I lean like in the perfect way you can see that
[196:53.44]You can see most of it.
[196:56.03]I'm going to try one more thing.
[197:01.03]That's kind of better.
[197:16.91]Better.
[197:17.11]I think it looks good.
[197:19.17]Alright.
[197:19.57]That seems a little bit better.
[197:29.49]Put the gloves back on?
[197:31.47]No.
[197:31.67]I threw them over there.
[197:33.09]Okay.
[197:34.61]I was working on green dragon.
[197:35.99]Continue that.
[197:38.77]That looks pretty good.
[197:43.01]I'd be upside down.
[197:52.63]There's so many dragons.
[197:55.01]There are a lot of dragons in here.
[198:13.30]yeah I said then because he's going like this one wing's that way one wing's going that way that's kind of hard to tell I don't know
[198:45.95]Accurate.
[198:48.45]Accurate.
[198:51.67]Not accurate.
[198:53.95]Accurate.
[198:56.77]Coming together.
[198:57.29]This is not even the Green Dragon's face.
[199:11.38]I'm trying to mush it on there.
[199:13.24]Who is it?
[199:13.64]Who is it?
[199:18.75]What character is that?
[199:24.61]Oh, shit!
[199:25.01]It's right there.
[199:25.97]Okay.
[199:28.85]That's not even... That's not even close to... Oh.
[199:32.50]Red Dragon.
[199:34.86]It's down here.
[199:35.40]Down here somewhere.
[199:41.88]Figure that out later.
[199:44.64]That's for later.
[199:47.79]Okay.
[199:50.41]Green dragon pieces.
[199:51.99]I would love to find a few more.
[199:53.45]He has a weird face.
[200:03.46]Kind of like side profile.
[200:04.36]Have you watched Tron?
[200:09.12]I have not seen Tron.
[200:11.84]Sorry, everybody.
[200:12.50]I didn't see Tron.
[200:16.86]Never seen Back to the Future 1, 2, or 3.
[200:22.52]Don't know how to ice skate.
[200:25.55]Never seen Jaws.
[200:27.57]Never seen Jaws 2.
[200:33.01]I have eaten dog food.
[200:43.20]This is over here somewhere.
[200:44.82]Can't figure that out yet.
[200:54.03]Okay, that's going over here.
[200:55.49]Wait.
[200:59.87]Another piece of the puzzle.
[201:01.73]It's over here somewhere.
[201:05.76]Okay.
[201:06.86]Stop thinking about that and think about green dragon.
[201:11.48]This looks like a piece of green dragon.
[201:14.42]Corner or something.
[201:20.07]Got it.
[201:20.27]Right there.
[201:20.99]Okay.
[201:21.31]Okay.
[201:24.43]Huh?
[201:26.17]You see my whole puzzle?
[201:30.37]Otto is starving.
[201:31.85]Otto, I think, just ate like an hour ago.
[201:35.57]Two hours ago?
[201:36.03]An hour and a half ago?
[201:39.35]Alright.
[201:39.81]I need the green dragon's face.
[201:42.54]Big time.
[201:51.06]Green dragon's face.
[201:56.32]this is pre-recorded uh if you believe it's pre-recorded that's uh it's up to you who's this
[202:31.45]down here that's accurate red dragon it's like kind of down there though next to it no you don't think so this is purple dragon
[202:53.12]Oh, shit.
[202:53.44]This is Purple Dragon, isn't it?
[202:54.76]Okay.
[202:55.68]That's above him.
[202:56.82]Up here.
[203:00.44]Up here somewhere.
[203:04.33]Where is his face?
[203:05.25]Where is his face?
[203:21.20]Shit.
[203:26.16]This is definitely this tale.
[203:29.46]Right?
[203:29.94]It's definitely this one here.
[203:30.86]Can you prove it's not pre-recorded?
[203:33.88]I just read your message.
[203:39.97]It goes down here, but I don't quite have the connection port.
[203:47.23]Later.
[203:47.55]Okay.
[203:54.45]Look what I found.
[203:56.53]finally I found it Jesus I've been looking for that piece for an hour and a half at least an hour how could it be so bright on camera and not be bright for me
[204:27.12]understand it okay um what else what else what else what else more shield guys down here which is kind of difficult to find a place for this one got it okay I can't really see that well but the shield guys look great getting close to connecting shield guys and dragon
[204:55.75]like this dragon is below shield guys how close to the okay shield guys are gonna wait a second wait just a second got it this is top of the tower and shield guys as you can see let me see if I can give you a better view
[205:26.68]shield guys and tower here like that okay this I'm gonna move some stuff out of the way this now has to go down here because this orange or yellow dragon is down here
[205:57.65]Can I connect this now?
[205:58.63]Ooh, I can.
[206:00.56]Okay, I got almost this whole side here now.
[206:02.68]I can connect this.
[206:11.34]Nice.
[206:11.74]Okay.
[206:12.28]Very cool.
[206:13.98]Progress is actually being made now.
[206:15.94]So this is all the side with the dragon and the shield guys.
[206:20.48]Now... Let's see.
[206:24.70]Can I...
[206:29.40]I don't think I'm ever going to get the non-schlacked pieces, unfortunately.
[206:39.19]That's okay.
[206:46.21]It's a little bit better.
[206:56.96]Alright, without this getting too out of control here, I need to finish this bottom side because there's like a bunch of bullshit over here.
[207:05.24]Or maybe not.
[207:06.96]Maybe I don't do that.
[207:09.24]Because this is going to be a pain in the ass to get this like the last section down here.
[207:17.65]Fill it out.
[207:19.31]Where's purple dragon?
[207:25.72]right there purple dragon's face purple dragon's kind of thin right next to these guys over here purple dragon's like right there can't really do purple dragon yet still looking for this guy's face
[207:57.13]Who's this guy?
[207:58.41]See what I mean, like what?
[208:25.27]what is this to me this looks like I don't know where is this see this like this shingles I don't see these shingles anywhere one of these roofs has those shingles
[208:55.91]Top right?
[208:59.56]Yeah, but that's like... This house is blue.
[209:03.10]This is not a blue house.
[209:04.10]It's shingles and then a shaded house.
[209:17.79]Offside the cliff to the left, maybe?
[209:22.69]I don't see the top part there, though.
[209:26.27]Is it upside down?
[209:28.37]Upside down.
[209:30.03]It's upside down.
[209:31.71]Alright.
[209:31.95]It's upside down.
[209:33.75]That's really good to know because I think it goes right here.
[209:36.49]I think that goes literally right here.
[209:44.18]It does.
[209:45.18]Okay.
[209:46.48]Well, there's that.
[209:48.72]That was that part right here.
[209:51.95]Alright.
[209:52.73]Nice.
[209:53.61]Cool.
[209:54.35]It's upside down.
[210:06.24]Now this middle area is a little funky.
[210:15.13]Kick the table?
[210:15.79]That would be a disaster.
[210:16.71]I can't do that right now.
[210:19.63]That would be a disaster.
[210:21.26]So no, I'm not going to kick the table.
[210:33.39]Hmm.
[210:37.65]Above the red dragon's head.
[210:42.27]How far above the red dragon is that little guy?
[210:44.44]Oh, he's to the left.
[210:47.20]He's over here.
[210:47.80]He's, like, here.
[210:56.67]Here?
[210:56.99]Put him down, maybe?
[211:08.43]I have ready yet there's like one more section to go like right there damn it I just saw this bingo that's right here very cool see very well

[217:33.20]I don't know what you're asking.
[217:38.06]Okay.
[217:40.26]I already see a couple of things to solve here.
[217:47.36]I did see this.
[217:49.26]This is going right there.
[217:51.94]Perfect.
[217:54.11]There is a piece here.
[217:55.39]Right there.
[217:57.33]Part of the tail.
[218:00.43]Then that means I can also probably go like this.
[218:02.87]And I can.
[218:04.57]Okay, so this is starting to... I'm going to have to pull this up even further.
[218:09.54]See the whole thing?
[218:10.52]We're getting there.
[218:23.47]alright cool now okay with the loose pieces in the box you know you're smart very smart thing to do you know what else is really smart to do is find this bush
[218:52.59]He looked up a guide.
[218:53.56]See, on the back of some jigsaw puzzles, it actually says the number of the piece, which you just put them in a row.
[219:02.34]I don't cheat.
[219:04.52]I'm playing the real game.
[219:19.13]How much further down does this go?
[219:23.03]Because this is still going.
[219:26.03]How big is this?
[219:27.37]Because this is still going down here.
[219:30.59]I might have to pull this back even further.
[219:31.97]Can't be that much more pieces after that, right?
[219:39.50]It's like a... This thing's fucking huge!
[219:44.81]this thing's huge better?
[220:04.78]I don't want it to fall on you
[220:12.93]good he's kind of falling down here guys got pac-man everything
[220:43.44]A shit stain on the carpet?
[220:46.30]Okay, don't move.
[220:53.24]Why are you surrounded by Pac-Man?
[220:57.43]I don't know, because I like Pac-Man.
[221:00.81]What, I can't have a Pac-Man carpet?
[221:04.55]Pac-Man fucking toy?
[221:05.93]Pac-Man clock?
[221:07.47]Pac-Man toys?
[221:08.63]Why not?
[221:13.62]Actually, I only have two Pac-Man things.
[221:16.84]Correct the record.
[221:19.58]Alright, enough of your bullshit.
[221:21.40]We got work to do.
[221:23.91]Alright, where am I going?
[221:26.77]Enough of this bullshit.
[221:27.61]We got work to do.
[221:28.21]Okay, this...
[221:49.50]Stop with the toys.
[221:50.94]Is a jigsaw puzzle a toy?
[221:53.04]Or is a jigsaw puzzle a... Is it a toy?
[221:57.48]I wouldn't call it a toy.
[222:03.87]Purple dragon?
[222:07.17]Purple dragon's weird.
[222:07.89]He's kind of... It's kind of like he's long.
[222:13.53]Uh... Wait a minute.
[222:28.74]Okay.
[222:29.92]And then... This is right there.
[222:37.07]What's right underneath?
[222:38.01]Okay, this is where it gets annoying.
[222:41.05]This is where it gets really annoying.
[222:43.85]Because... We've got a good area here.
[222:49.67]This is where I can start to plug and play.
[222:57.52]Plug and play.
[222:59.99]This is water.
[223:03.58]Breeze.
[223:04.78]Where is that?
[223:09.20]Right there.
[223:11.40]There.
[223:12.86]Middle.
[223:14.10]Right there.
[223:17.10]Still a little bit further below this.
[223:19.34]I can't put that here, but it's kind of like right there.
[223:29.81]Let me finish the shield, guys, because there's a couple more over here.
[223:32.03]There's like two more, and they're right side pieces.
[223:43.66]I don't know what that is, but I think it's part of this.
[223:49.80]Hard to tell.
[223:52.55]Okay.
[223:55.47]Okay.
[223:57.48]Silent Hill OST.
[223:58.18]Maybe we'll do that after.
[223:59.98]Purple dragon or is this blue dragon?
[224:10.22]Is there a blue dragon?
[224:17.66]Okay.
[224:17.98]This is part of this dragon down here.
[224:28.77]I can almost connect this to here.
[224:29.89]Where's the king?
[224:32.13]Okay.
[224:37.43]Getting there.
[224:41.29]There are the shield.
[224:42.19]There are the other shield guys.
[224:45.23]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[224:46.11]I'm going to be able to start to build this out.
[224:49.49]This should go over here.
[224:50.63]Close.
[224:53.33]Oh, fuck you.
[225:01.77]How is this even just connected?
[225:07.95]Okay.
[225:08.15]It's there.
[225:10.39]I've been live for three hours and 45 minutes.
[225:14.93]No, I haven't.
[225:17.21]I'm just kind of having fun.
[225:18.83]I'm fine with this.
[225:21.65]Okay, I'm going to say this is going to take me another one hour.
[225:25.25]I'll be done at about 4.40.
[225:26.37]Let's check this out.
[225:28.65]Ready?
[225:28.81]Ready?
[225:34.30]I got no more pieces in my pockets.
[225:44.16]Beautiful.
[225:44.66]Perfect.
[225:46.93]That's the connection right there.
[225:49.37]Can you see?
[225:53.47]Not really.
[225:59.02]This ends... The dragon's tail is right there.
[226:05.26]Alright, more shield guys.
[226:06.56]Here they are.
[226:07.02]I don't think that's correct.
[226:12.96]How many are there?
[226:13.54]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[226:13.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[226:13.92]Damn it.
[226:37.51]ah aha okay looking pretty good over here just need where it just gets kind of funky because different colors so what is this one what's right above his head blue and a door it's blue in like a doorway
[227:06.43]Can we listen to Yes?
[227:07.51]I don't know what that means.
[227:09.39]Okay.
[227:12.49]I have a ton of these pieces, but I don't know if I'm ready to do this part yet.
[227:17.40]I think so.
[227:18.64]It's so erratic.
[227:23.92]I'm just completely guessing, okay?
[227:25.92]Because there's so many different windows.
[227:27.50]So many different pillars.
[227:31.93]The one thing, though, is this dragon right here is coming up.
[227:37.80]right here okay it was right next to the dragon it sounded like a door just a door close to the edge by yes close to the edge you said close to the edge did you find one oh my god yes please huh
[228:07.84]Oh, yes is a different song.
[228:09.48]If I can get this in there.
[228:35.99]I think so.
[228:38.72]Too many pieces.
[228:39.32]Too many colors.
[228:42.58]Too many colors.
[228:44.42]Ugh.
[228:48.28]Too many colors.
[228:51.74]Why didn't I know?
[228:52.20]I should have got a puzzle that was like... Blue.
[228:55.77]Orange.
[228:58.01]Just a yellow face.
[229:00.49]With just two... That would have been actually horrible.
[229:04.13]Speaking of every color being like green.
[229:05.85]If every color was yellow, it would be like... Why even do the puzzle?
[229:14.44]The end here, and there's one or two pieces below this.
[229:22.18]Okay.
[229:22.82]There's an egg.
[229:25.82]He's a Pac-Man enjoyer?
[229:27.21]I would call myself a Pac-Man enjoyer.
[229:28.67]I just think Pac-Man's a cool character.
[229:30.73]I just think he's funny.
[229:33.37]I like Pac-Man as an actor, not as a video game.
[230:07.37]This is like here somewhere.
[230:18.25]I need a much bigger table.
[230:19.37]Honestly, I would say like half the problem is my workspace is dog shit.
[230:25.76]This is a dog shit workspace.
[230:28.70]And I can't fix it until the next time I do this.
[230:31.50]So I have to live with it.
[230:33.04]Hmm.
[230:44.87]I have so many, like, sections done.
[230:48.77]Not all of it.
[230:49.71]Let's see if I can start working down here.
[230:55.86]You can't see.
[230:56.34]Well, you can a little.
[231:00.83]Alright, I'm just going to be an old man and I'll be down here for a minute.
[231:08.42]I'm doing the bottom.
[231:09.04]Alright, I'll be right back.
[231:43.15]Does?
[231:45.11]It sure does.
[231:45.83]Okay.
[231:49.37]Does that go over there too?
[231:52.58]No.
[231:56.58]Is he riding the purple dragon?
[232:05.48]He is.
[232:05.82]This guy's riding the purple dragon.
[232:09.43]I was wondering, like, where the hell does he go?
[232:11.41]He's right here.
[232:16.08]Okay, with that, knowing that... Kind of a mess over there.
[232:26.74]Um... There goes the paper, but whatever.
[232:37.41]Hmm.
[232:44.60]I don't need to get this edge, but... How can you even fucking tell?
[232:48.42]That's not right.
[232:56.30]Eh, that's not right either.
[233:11.73]It's all GREEN!
[233:16.79]Everything looks like this fucking piece!
[233:24.65]It's all bushes!
[233:39.42]Where the fuck is this guy supposed to go?
[233:41.14]It's a bush!
[233:54.25]alright there's the door okay deal right yeah I got like so much done
[234:24.82]This is one of my favorite streams of yours?
[234:30.19]Thanks.
[234:31.35]Is it 480p camera?
[234:33.29]No, no, it's not.
[234:35.83]Here's something that you need to know.
[234:38.11]All webcams that have ever come out in the last 10 years, for some reason, all look identical.
[234:44.73]No matter what.
[234:45.59]They just all look exactly the fucking same.
[234:48.15]And it's been the same technology for like 12 years.
[234:51.39]I don't understand.
[234:55.95]Dude, I've probably had like nine different webcams over the course of, I want to say, 15 years.
[235:02.97]They all have looked identical.
[235:05.51]And we're talking from 720p to fucking 4K.
[235:08.92]They've all been identical.
[235:11.10]Doesn't matter what kind of lighting I have.
[235:12.76]It's the same exact image.
[235:13.84]They're identical.
[235:15.36]All of them.
[235:16.02]All of them.
[235:17.62]All of them.
[235:19.94]They're all bad.
[235:29.42]Alright, speaking of cameras.
[235:36.30]I have a solution to my current problem.
[235:39.85]Here's what I'm going to do.
[235:43.27]I'm going to do this.
[235:47.75]I need to move this way up here.
[235:51.89]Okay.
[235:53.45]Then all pieces need to go back
[235:59.57]Man, all this green shit.
[236:06.02]I gotta get the only way.
[236:08.32]It's the only way.
[236:08.98]It's gonna be painful, but I have to do it.
[236:13.58]Try to find every edge.
[236:16.10]Every edge is the same color, so that's gonna be fun.
[236:33.10]bottom.
[236:35.22]Is this the bottom left corner?
[236:40.32]Like, where is this?
[236:45.58]Maybe?
[236:45.88]It could be the bottom right corner, though, couldn't it?
[236:50.91]It could be either one.
[236:53.17]That's my problem.
[236:58.97]I know this is on the left.
[237:10.10]Yes.
[237:13.14]On the edge.
[237:30.02]Oh.
[237:34.54]Oh.
[237:39.68]I guess it belongs over there.
[237:40.59]There's an edge.
[238:10.26]more grim oh this is a good song I need like the thing that looks like a nest this thing is way longer than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be like here but this is like long and not that wide apparently
[238:43.20]Get the sword.
[238:46.94]There.
[239:13.27]Doesn't really help me, though.
[239:14.35]Got another piece to connect to this one.
[239:28.26]This is the right wing?
[239:44.23]That's like kind of right here.
[239:47.25]Can't really put it there yet.
[239:48.95]Okay.
[239:56.46]Where's the rest of that blue dragon?
[239:57.98]I don't think I've seen his body since starting.
[240:01.02]Okay.
[240:16.92]Any more left edges that I have not found?
[240:24.90]That's accurate.
[240:33.18]Come on.
[240:34.65]Talk you over.
[240:53.37]This could be the bottom here, though, too.
[240:54.87]Could be a bottom piece.
[240:57.51]Gonna go play Hollow Knight?
[240:58.59]Have fun.
[240:59.11]I hope it's as exhilarating as I think it would be.
[241:03.21]Bottom.
[241:08.83]Same as all the other pieces.
[241:22.26]Check your pockets.
[241:24.76]Oh, I got nothing to talk about.
[241:25.76]They all gotta be here somewhere.
[241:28.48]Hmm.
[241:57.19]I think this is the green dragon.
[241:58.85]Okay.
[242:06.92]Remember, when you're retired, what do you plan on doing?
[242:08.72]Like, you're a pretty good actor.
[242:10.82]You could probably do some stuff.
[242:13.24]Um, I don't know, honestly.
[242:15.24]I think I'm just kind of playing this sort of retirement.
[242:20.69]Just kind of by ear.
[242:21.77]I don't really have a plan, but...
[242:26.46]I don't know I kind of like what I'm doing now production stuff behind the scenes type stuff I think I have a lot of fun with it um
[242:52.80]Who said that?
[242:54.58]There's a big highlighted message here.
[242:56.28]I'm not making it up.
[243:01.14]There's a blue dragon.
[243:07.57]Good.
[243:10.29]This side is going to be pretty much done soon.
[243:13.33]Should be a voice actor.
[243:17.65]I mean, also, too, I'll be really honest with you guys.
[243:23.40]I don't know how much I want to, like, do, like, in front of the camera stuff.
[243:28.48]I think I'm happy doing stuff in front of the camera, but I definitely like the kind of writing and creative direction and that kind of stuff.
[243:39.32]I think that's where I'll probably always end up.
[243:41.60]It's not that I don't like being in front of the camera.
[243:45.19]I mean, obviously, how the fuck could I ever say that and have it be an accurate statement, right?
[243:51.67]But...
[243:54.34]I definitely, as I've gotten a little older, I've had a little bit more fun behind the camera.
[244:03.10]Still live?
[244:03.56]Yeah, I'll be live until this is done.
[244:05.58]Where... This is really coming together, though.
[244:08.20]It is.
[244:09.14]Just the green shit I have to worry about.
[244:10.89]At least a bit over here.
[244:20.83]One of these does.
[244:22.95]Kind of has to, right?
[244:23.83]Okay.
[244:26.05]okay where am I going what am I doing who am I filling in what's up there okay what's the underneath this dragon over here which I don't know how well you can see but it's a big puzzle I gotta find all this shit and put it in the right place and it's just this missing spot right here
[244:52.89]Okay, there's a guy with drums.
[244:55.55]Where is that guy?
[244:56.39]He's got his hands up like this.
[244:57.95]I have no idea where he is.
[245:02.59]That's a piece that I need.
[245:03.95]I saw him earlier.
[245:09.33]Where the fuck is this guy?
[245:10.33]I don't know where the hell that goes.
[245:22.72]Is there another egg?
[245:23.84]Is there another egg?
[245:32.78]See the mac and cheese that you have?
[245:34.41]I'll show you the boxes in a few minutes.
[245:37.59]Oh, is it an egg?
[245:39.03]It's sitting in a nest.
[245:40.95]The egg part is the one that's missing from the right side.
[245:43.25]There's an egg in the lower left.
[245:56.35]Where's this other egg?
[245:58.67]Oh, it's above these guys.
[246:00.51]Shit.
[246:03.91]The thing is, I have all these pieces, but all the in-between green pieces are just not even remotely done.
[246:12.25]That's going to be the huge hang-up here, even if I connect these.
[246:17.39]Alright, back down to the ground.
[246:43.83]Where's that other egg piece that I just had right there?
[246:45.42]I don't know, dude.
[246:51.80]I don't know.
[247:09.10]Alright.
[247:19.21]So you can get your dad.
[247:20.85]Okay.
[247:21.79]That's all?
[247:24.61]I'm just getting started.
[247:27.76]Back to bed.
[247:49.34]stitches are gonna drive me crazy okay oh it's like you see one and you see them all they're all the same like they're all the same piece jet and they could be any side
[248:38.78]I can't believe there are people that thought he was going to finish this.
[248:42.74]If I had the sides, man, but all the fucking sides, they're all the same.
[248:48.28]I got it.
[248:51.99]Don't worry.
[248:52.35]I'll figure it out.
[249:00.07]Go under the table and peek?
[249:04.44]Oh, you mean like...
[249:34.96]are you finding the green pieces like a person should not be here that that does not make any sense logically but it was still fun oh here you want to see you didn't think that we were doing bald and cheesy
[249:57.36]Cheetos?
[249:58.30]Macaroni and cheese?
[249:59.00]You didn't think that didn't... You didn't think they made the cut?
[250:01.90]Oh.
[250:02.86]Well, the crate and barrel.
[250:05.82]A cracker... Cracker barrel.
[250:15.87]I will tell you.
[250:17.89]Uh, Cracker Barrel is, is my favorite.
[250:20.88]So I already know what my favorite is, but we can still, we can still figure it out.
[250:25.24]Uh, there's like seven or eight more boxes over there.
[250:29.02]Go to bed.
[250:31.32]I have to finish this puzzle because I got it.
[250:33.81]I was like, oh, it's 300.
[250:35.41]It's going to be fucking like three or four hours.
[250:37.47]I didn't realize all the green shit.
[250:42.37]Don't get angry.
[250:51.77]already been yeah but here's the thing I put a piece in and then we talk for 10 minutes like I put a piece in we talk for five minutes put a piece in we talk for five minutes like I I'm not just in a quiet room with just no lights on with a flashlight just doing this um we're talking we're hanging out alright ready I'm walking here
[252:28.13]What happened to the camera uh, I moved it because it we started to get more real estate What fucking hell is going on Gotta get lucky
[252:54.51]Left or right?
[252:55.11]That's the part that's really impossible to tell.
[252:58.27]Even with the picture.
[253:05.59]The whole right side of these bushes.
[253:07.21]The whole left side of these bushes, too.
[253:09.75]And the whole bottom.
[253:12.39]Oy vey.
[253:13.13]Okay.
[253:21.80]Almost have the left side, though.
[253:25.27]Got all these edges, but
[253:56.14]I've tried every combination except the one that works.
[254:01.35]I've tried every single combination of every edge.
[254:04.57]Except it's been so randomized to me that I have not found one match.
[254:12.08]This looks connected.
[254:14.44]But look, I don't think it is.
[254:17.48]That doesn't make sense.
[254:18.62]That doesn't work.
[254:21.40]I mean, it should look, but it's weird.
[254:48.40]this is absolutely the bottom because this is where they're standing this is like the Resident Evil puzzle it's just it's just all the stuff that is exactly like this part's gonna be hell too like this is gonna be hell this is hell this is hell this is hell
[255:16.85]It could be anywhere.
[255:17.67]It could be anywhere.
[255:19.13]If you have a bush in your hand, it could literally be anywhere on this whole map.
[255:29.81]I had better progress building out from the middle.
[255:33.61]That's exactly what we're going to do.
[255:37.47]You can be seated.
[255:41.87]Get all this the fuck out of my way before I airmail it across the room
[255:48.00]Okay, goodbye.
[255:49.08]Thank you.
[255:49.66]It was a swell time.
[255:51.42]It's been swell.
[255:53.22]It's been swell.
[255:54.84]Bush number 450.
[255:56.42]It's been fun.
[255:58.39]Okay, please get out of my way.
[256:01.33]Let's do the house in the middle.
[256:02.25]I thought you were putting them in the box?
[256:06.83]Well, the thing is, if you put them in the box, then you can't... If you put them all in the box, then it's like, I need this piece.
[256:13.85]It's like, well, I gotta go back in the box.
[256:15.29]I might as well just keep it out.
[256:31.94]Is he molding at a puzzle?
[256:34.41]Yeah.
[256:35.83]Yeah, I am.
[256:39.53]Yeah.
[256:39.71]Could you tell?
[256:43.37]I need to get them all down here.
[256:48.96]And I need to see what the orientation is.
[256:51.18]Because some of them are, like, dark.
[256:53.46]Some of them are light.
[256:56.38]Some of them are dark.
[256:57.34]Some of them are lighter.
[256:58.27]So, okay.
[257:06.13]If I build it down here, I should be fine.
[257:08.09]Alright, I know what I'm doing.
[257:10.25]Then I can connect that to this.
[257:11.45]Let's start that.
[257:21.87]Put all those pieces together.
[257:26.10]Too much of a pain in the ass, but you never know.
[257:28.42]Let's find out.
[257:29.06]Okay, so this is it.
[257:34.08]Am I going the right way here?
[257:40.65]This is why you need the box right here.
[257:43.60]I didn't even mean to rip it.
[257:51.30]You can't see it, but I can.
[257:53.81]I'm just going to hold it.
[258:01.73]CrazyStreamer solves a puzzle.
[258:03.89]Oh, this is a nuclear reactor?
[258:11.21]so all the ones that are darker are right in the middle and it looks like it's circles the circles are the way up
[258:40.96]there's like a weird magician guy hold on where does he go this is an insane method of doing a puzzle I would okay I would have done the edges but I didn't know how big it was going to be and the edges were kind of confusing because they're all green so that's my method to my madness
[259:08.09]He's like on the right side of this thing here.
[259:16.16]Up here.
[259:16.62]You know when you do a puzzle and you feel like it's not big enough?
[259:20.98]I feel like he's so much further away on the paper than this guy.
[259:25.68]Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear, right?
[259:28.24]I feel like this is way far away.
[259:54.65]I need a fucking magnifying glass.
[260:03.38]Alright.
[260:03.64]That's like right in the middle.
[260:09.86]No, is it?
[260:10.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[260:11.06]It's like that because the top of that part.
[260:14.24]Okay.
[260:16.32]That's that.
[260:17.13]I wish I had a 10 times bigger fucking table.
[260:23.95]Everything's like in the way.
[260:24.93]Okay.
[260:33.08]If you're blue, you're on the bottom.
[260:34.44]This is the roof.
[260:38.23]This is the house.
[260:39.31]Is this upside down?
[260:42.05]It is not.
[260:56.72]players in this castle.
[261:05.98]Is that a weird king guy?
[261:22.59]No, that's not.
[261:28.73]Define the online guide.
[261:33.85]This is difficult.
[261:35.60]I would call this puzzle difficult.
[261:36.84]You know what's funny?
[261:39.02]I had one that was just cats.
[261:41.38]And then this hard one.
[261:42.70]I was like, why did I not pick cats?
[261:45.72]Why did I not just pick the cat one?
[261:47.92]With distinct cat faces.
[261:49.38]It was cats.
[261:54.24]It was funny cats.
[262:01.57]I'm still in good shape, though.
[262:02.87]I would say I just need to get this situated.
[262:06.61]Once you get up, like, the writer's block of certain parts of a puzzle, just keep moving.
[262:12.28]And I'm doing alright.
[262:13.94]I'm doing alright.
[262:23.08]Need...
[262:26.04]This middle part is weird because it's like red.
[262:28.48]Because it's a different building.
[262:29.46]Because it's two buildings like right on top of each other.
[262:36.19]Oh, fuck me.
[262:39.57]Okay.
[262:54.63]a bush great let me go get some of this because I I know it's all bushes this is like right here it could be anything oh great gravy wait let's do this goes
[263:30.50]sub stream just did a puzzle in two hours yeah you got like 50 you got like 100 people working on it you tell me sub stream and the Discord just finished a puzzle and puzzle in two hours you've got 150 people I'm just one idiot you've got like 500 people doing that I'm one dickhead
[264:05.61]Fuck you, puzzle.
[264:07.63]Okay.
[264:09.19]I gotta get it out of my system.
[264:15.00]Shit.
[264:17.62]Oh, I'm like trapped because all the pieces are like that same kind of green.
[264:23.00]And I'm like, I'm trapped here.
[264:26.21]I need to find a way out of this.
[264:27.49]And the way out is to pick a section and forget about all the green bushes.
[264:33.07]Just do this one.
[264:34.75]What is right there?
[264:35.49]I got it.
[264:35.85]I got it.
[264:36.15]I got it.
[264:36.43]Here we go.
[264:37.17]It's a mountain.
[264:38.43]It's a mountain.
[264:40.75]See?
[264:42.50]The edges are... I'm not gonna be able to do the edges.
[264:44.98]There are three different edges that are the same exact edge.
[264:48.94]I don't know.
[264:50.54]I'll do that later.
[264:56.74]This is an egg.
[264:57.40]I think that's down here.
[264:59.70]Alright, I need pieces that look like a mountain.
[265:16.07]This is a mountain.
[265:20.03]This is a mountain.
[265:21.59]A mountain here.
[265:23.89]I'm just getting the little shaded mountain pieces.
[265:28.03]I should be able to do that over here okay because then that can connect there okay that's a mountain okay did he rip it again no it I it's it was just ripped already this is part of that mountain alright now let me put this down
[265:55.38]Because then there's this blue dragon on this mountain.
[265:59.93]There he is.
[266:00.45]And now the question is, where's the rest of the blue dragon?
[266:05.81]He's climbing up.
[266:09.75]This is the purple dragon.
[266:13.59]Where's the blue dragon?
[266:14.96]This is blue dragon.
[266:25.22]I just did a piece.
[266:25.94]Would you look at that?
[266:27.76]I need more purple, I mean, more blue dragon.
[266:34.87]Just saw that and I had to complete it.
[266:37.81]Blue dragon's body.
[266:39.11]There we go.
[266:44.45]Green dragon's face.
[266:47.15]Oh, I'm spooked.
[266:51.80]Purple dragon something.
[266:54.54]I don't know what, but I'm going to put it with purple dragon.
[266:56.98]This is also purple dragon.
[267:00.68]I have no idea.
[267:01.54]I think actually it's here.
[267:02.68]Blue dragon.
[267:11.29]Blue, blue, blue, blue.
[267:24.71]red okay this goes here show Otto he's right here he'll come over if he wants to come over hey look come over here what are you doing you want to be on camera
[267:53.66]You want to watch me have a meltdown?
[267:54.82]Well, I can't finish this puzzle.
[267:59.65]Okay.
[268:00.99]I got blue.
[268:02.01]No, this is green dragon.
[268:04.67]Okay.
[268:11.32]Green dragon is pretty much almost done completely.
[268:14.70]This is... Oh, here it is.
[268:19.02]Good.
[268:19.36]Okay.
[268:19.74]Now I'm moving.
[268:20.54]Now I'm moving.
[268:21.02]Okay.
[268:24.53]Oh, Blue Dragon is done.
[268:25.61]I need the tip.
[268:35.94]I need the tip of Blue Dragon's wing.
[268:37.87]Oh, let me grab it.
[268:54.91]got hey we got the velveta one we got annie's this one's I don't think this one's gonna be very good I I have nothing against I have nothing against velveta but I have everything against velveta do you know what I mean by that
[269:19.99]I will eat something that has Velveeta on it and go, wow, that was kind of great.
[269:25.05]But then I'll kind of be like, oh, I really wish I didn't do that.
[269:30.89]But it's really good.
[269:32.40]It is good.
[269:33.06]Where's the Stouffer's?
[269:33.80]Don't worry.
[269:35.08]Oh, Otto, right.
[269:36.16]He ran away.
[269:37.54]Maybe he'll come.
[269:38.30]He's like, he runs around.
[269:39.56]He'll see him again.
[269:40.10]Okay.
[269:42.28]What the hell was I just doing?
[269:50.38]Realistically, there's not very many pieces left that are not connected.
[269:54.06]It's true.
[269:57.55]There's probably like 50 pieces that are not connected.
[270:01.07]It's just connecting these pieces of... It's fun.
[270:06.71]What's this one?
[270:08.17]Okay, wait.
[270:08.79]Got that right there.
[270:13.14]Smaller chunks.
[270:15.52]I think I'm doing a pretty good job right now.
[270:17.46]Alright, where's the duck?
[270:24.99]Where's the little duck?
[270:45.61]Oh, okay.
[270:46.13]Right next to this blue dragon down here.
[270:54.24]Okay, still don't have enough to connect that, which is crazy.
[271:04.97]What's next to the blue dragon?
[271:07.43]Another one of these, kind of?
[271:09.91]Yep, right here.
[271:12.71]Okay.
[271:14.71]And then next to that, a little bit more trunk down, which I think is right here.
[271:25.45]no it is okay cool what is that piece to the left hard to tell when approaching the green pieces think about the light source how the light is hitting the trees and bushes yeah it's gonna have to be last because
[271:51.95]I know where this could be, but I don't even want to think about it.
[271:59.13]This is here.
[272:03.16]Where is that?
[272:10.16]Is that right there next to the duck?
[272:13.20]No, it's not.
[272:16.78]Okay, above the duck.
[272:21.16]you know where it could be just put it there well I don't that's the thing I have no idea there's a lot of those green bush pieces that could be on any side so I'm just trying to work with stuff that I know where it actually is supposed to be which is this stuff now I got that which is part of I don't really tape this thing in front of my eyes
[272:53.06]Is it upside down?
[273:01.77]Tape it together.
[273:02.55]It is upside down.
[273:14.10]That part right there.
[273:14.92]Okay, so that's like below the peak of
[273:22.54]next to this guy peak is it is though but it isn't it's the other side of this thing
[274:19.48]only one peak on this thing because if it is it's right there no there's more than there's like five oh my god there's like so many peaks uh different song
[275:04.33]I don't know somewhere over here put on Deltarune let me just connect let me get this connected because like there's just so much missing space just puke
[275:40.64]I just saw that.
[275:41.56]Where is it?
[275:43.30]It's like Rapunzel or something.
[275:48.67]What else?
[275:49.13]Hold on.
[275:51.61]Okay, that's also on the peak.
[275:55.75]But not quite.
[275:56.58]It's so spread out.
[276:24.03]Alright, I'm going for it.
[276:30.13]Alright, let's do it.
[276:33.35]We're only going to have edges out, and I'm just going to do it.
[276:35.80]I keep saying I'm going to do it, and now we're doing it for real.
[276:43.34]Put everything in my pockets and only have edges.
[276:46.11]Only.
[276:46.35]Only.
[276:48.98]is just needing to come to terms with needing to do that with these pieces makes me want to puke.
[276:55.30]But you know what?
[276:56.02]Let's go for it.
[277:01.22]I need that guy.
[277:01.94]I don't know for what, but I need him.
[277:11.05]Ed Stratt, Ed Stratt, Ed Stratt.
[277:12.39]Yeah, that's what I usually would do.
[277:19.20]Edge Strat with this one was not ideal for me.
[277:34.59]Those green pieces on the left should fit.
[277:37.41]You would think so.
[277:40.02]Okay.
[277:44.12]It's not an edge.
[277:44.94]It's going in my pocket.
[277:46.16]I don't care how done it is.
[278:01.01]Remind me, I have those over there.
[278:28.66]Eh.
[278:29.98]Stick with the plan.
[278:30.70]I need to stick to the plan or it won't work.
[278:58.80]Oh, it is silent.
[279:00.48]It's just... Okay.
[279:15.83]Edges are the only thing that are here.
[279:19.73]So... Where do you all go?
[281:33.33]Why is this out here?
[281:34.23]There's only a certain amount of combinations it can even be, right?
[281:44.09]Why do I feel like I don't have enough pieces?
[281:59.90]There's probably a bunch on the floor.
[282:02.33]I have a bunch of my pockets, but... I feel like I just... Where are all these pieces?
[282:09.04]I know this is on the bottom.
[282:10.20]I'm certain of it.
[282:14.06]I haven't been able to connect one piece down here.
[282:18.92]They could be fucking anywhere.
[282:21.74]And even if I get it right, it's kind of hard to tell.
[282:39.55]he looking at the picture it doesn't really help because it's just a bunch of bushes some of these make sense like over here it has to be like that but that doesn't fit this looks like this dragon's like part of the dragon
[283:11.02]Because there's two trees down here and two trees over here.
[283:14.10]But guess what?
[283:15.65]There are trees here.
[283:16.77]There are trees here.
[283:17.93]There are trees here.
[283:20.93]There's tree trunks around the whole thing.
[283:24.31]So I need these two tree trunks.
[283:28.94]I think these are them.
[283:31.52]And then I need a bush connected to the tree trunks.
[283:36.34]And then a big pine tree.
[283:49.23]I have to be... There has to be pieces in my fucking pockets that I don't have out.
[283:54.96]Right?
[283:55.18]There has to be, right?
[283:57.08]Because I feel like this is not enough.
[284:00.02]Let me see how many of these I can even connect.
[284:08.59]It's like... This is correct, but it's not quite.
[284:13.25]I'm not even sure this... This might be on the right side.
[284:27.04]Because right underneath these guys is like the end of the puzzle.
[284:36.60]One, two, three, four, five, six of them.
[284:45.05]Fuck me.
[284:47.65]Okay.
[284:48.41]This is way lower.
[284:50.57]This is a weird ass puzzle.
[284:52.91]Is this thing like this long?
[284:54.99]And like this wide?
[284:57.66]What is the dimensions of this thing?
[285:00.82]Because there's like a lot more underneath this.
[285:06.22]Like 16 by 20 or something?
[285:07.74]Or maybe more?
[285:10.96]Work your way up to the middle?
[285:13.81]Yeah.
[285:15.29]It's easier said than done right now.
[285:38.97]Top was easy because it was distinct clouds.
[285:43.27]There are just so many trees.
[285:44.89]I need to, can I even find the tops of these?
[285:50.18]Where's the three trees?
[285:51.18]I'm looking for a triple tree.
[285:55.76]Okay, the three tree is on the left.
[285:58.66]Underneath these guys?
[286:03.12]That's not correct, but it's down here somewhere.
[286:08.16]the last guy is see what I'm saying like this is the three trees right there right kind of has to be doesn't it and it's like then there's a bush on top and then the guy there's more down here
[286:43.90]mobile ad no this is this is hard this is hard everything just looks the same this is like part of a tree but I don't think this is okay alright I gotta walk away for a second left side is upside down
[287:17.30]But then it would be a right side then, right?
[287:23.34]Oh, that was annoying.
[287:25.22]Okay, well that works.
[287:30.22]It's all fucking green!
[287:33.70]Don't ever get angry at a puzzle.
[287:35.04]There's no reason to.
[287:41.19]This thing is deep!
[287:44.32]Look at how deep this goes.
[287:45.66]This is like even deeper than what we have.
[287:47.74]I don't have this.
[287:49.16]I don't have this many pieces in my pocket still.
[287:51.70]Fuck this green shit.
[288:24.62]It's not that.
[288:30.08]It's a tree trunk right there.
[288:31.34]It's not that tree trunk.
[288:36.67]Some other trees.
[288:37.53]No, no.
[288:43.25]So then what is this?
[288:44.13]Is this the same side?
[288:49.05]Come on, do the corners.
[288:54.60]I don't know.
[288:55.23]It could be this one, but that could be over here too.
[288:58.21]It's the exact same piece.
[289:00.69]And I really mean that if you look at the corners.
[289:02.27]Okay.
[289:06.23]I'm getting it.
[289:06.71]I'm getting it.
[289:07.59]I'm getting it.
[289:08.07]I'm getting it.
[289:08.93]I'm getting it.
[289:16.34]Bro.
[289:18.20]Which one of these are you?
[289:32.06]This shit has to be an edge.
[289:34.32]I swear I have pieces in my pockets that I just fucking haphazardly threw in here.
[289:44.69]He's getting it.
[289:45.51]Almost hour number five.
[289:46.57]I was thinking it was going to be like a three to four hour thing.
[289:52.03]I have been talking a lot.
[289:53.91]I have been just kind of saying random things.
[289:56.57]But neither here nor there.
[290:00.69]Almost done.
[290:03.27]Does the bottom edge piece go on the top right?
[290:06.25]So I have the top right.
[290:08.73]I have the top.
[290:09.73]The whole top is done.
[290:12.79]It's just getting these pieces in the right spot.
[290:16.93]Just mind-numbing.
[290:18.42]I have to have pieces in here that I didn't do.
[290:22.60]I have an edge.
[290:27.54]Yeah, this has an edge.
[290:28.50]What are you doing?
[290:38.99]OK.
[290:42.97]This might even miss.
[290:43.61]Is it right here?
[290:45.59]No, it is not.
[290:53.72]That's an edge.
[290:55.98]Is that it?
[290:57.04]No.
[291:02.60]I miss all these edges.
[291:24.71]No, I think they're all out there.
[291:25.89]This one's kind of an edge.
[291:29.65]Okay.
[291:43.73]Huh?
[291:46.64]Don't throw pieces away.
[291:47.60]You might not finish it.
[291:48.76]I'm just putting them over here.
[291:54.19]Is that technically an edge?
[292:01.84]I think that's up here somewhere.
[292:03.44]I believe that's accurate.
[292:21.76]Well, I'm down to the last bit here.
[292:24.00]Not it either.
[293:00.05]Doesn't even go together.
[293:02.55]OK, so here are all the green pieces that have an edge.
[293:07.17]At least 99% of them.
[293:12.86]I need to find one that has a tree trunk like in here.
[293:17.62]That one does, but it doesn't fit there.
[293:24.20]This one doesn't fit here either.
[293:34.53]This one doesn't fit here either.
[293:41.84]Son of a fuck.
[293:48.30]Okay.
[293:50.78]I'm going to lose my bet.
[293:53.88]I really didn't think it was going to take this long.
[293:55.54]This is way more complicated on the edges than I thought it was going to be.
[294:00.83]But that we have to put it, we have to deal with it because I did say, and I just was talking like SpongeBob there.
[294:07.14]By the way, that piece didn't want to go in, but it's the right one.
[294:17.46]It needs to be like dark with a light green on the end here.
[294:34.35]I can't, for the life of me, I cannot find this fucking piece.
[294:43.59]It really might be on the ground, and I'm gonna be so mad if it is.
[294:46.33]I've had these three connected for so long.
[295:02.05]Everything just feels like it just doesn't match.
[295:05.62]Oh, I need music.
[295:06.86]How about Pluck?
[295:23.27]Hey, look at Pluck.
[295:30.74]Deltarune?
[295:31.44]Yeah, actually, that's a good one.
[295:45.85]hey look music okay I still don't understand how I can't find this one
[296:10.09]yeah it's like a it's like his hand it's like the end of his hand and then this sand where is his hand I don't have his hand like I I don't see a claw
[296:41.54]Because it's not an end piece.
[296:43.65]Then I don't need it.
[296:44.43]So what is right below that?
[296:53.26]It's more bush.
[296:54.80]It's more just dark bush.
[296:59.22]Maybe a little sand on the bottom?
[297:12.77]Fucking eat my ass.
[297:14.61]Like, honestly, god.
[297:15.67]And it's just a- and it's all bush.
[298:36.08]I don't know.
[298:40.73]Is it a light green?
[298:41.67]Is that it?
[298:47.85]I can't... I don't know.
[298:49.63]I don't think that's it, but it could be.
[298:52.15]It's identical.
[298:56.25]Well, I know that's over there now.
[298:57.79]Put this away.
[298:59.19]We'll just brute force on it.
[299:37.10]Is that it?
[299:37.64]I don't- it feels like it isn't though.
[299:43.15]I feel like that's not correct.
[299:45.73]We're at the five hour mark?
[299:47.71]Yeah, I don't think... Once this is done, it won't take much longer.
[299:51.03]I've got, like, another... You know, like, hundred fucking pieces to do.
[299:54.35]So, yeah.
[300:01.18]Great.
[300:07.76]I think this goes here?
[300:10.53]No, this is, like, part of a claw.
[300:14.55]More like 200 pieces.
[300:16.27]I don't think it's that many.
[300:17.37]I think it's like 60.
[300:17.85]Where are those two stupid ass trees?
[300:45.69]Okay, so then there's a bush next to that, and then two trees.
[300:49.61]I don't think I have this one.
[301:41.08]well let me try this because this is like blue
[301:51.72]And then there's green with what's underneath it.
[302:01.10]Alright, if you took away the video, take the visual away.
[302:05.07]I am a grumpy dad making an Ikea chair.
[302:08.61]There's a fucking paper.
[302:11.03]Give it and let me see it.
[302:12.29]Okay.
[302:14.35]It's all green.
[302:16.05]I don't understand.
[302:16.95]Where did the green piece go?
[302:19.93]Oh, this is a real crock of shit.
[302:26.34]They just add screwdriver sounds and like hammer sounds every so often.
[302:31.28]I don't understand how I'm supposed to do this.
[302:37.58]You can't.
[302:37.94]Where's the wood?
[302:38.96]Where's the trees?
[302:41.08]Like, yeah, yeah.
[302:44.62]Can you read the instructions?
[302:47.75]I don't need to read the instructions?
[302:49.37]No!
[302:49.81]I work... I do... middle out!
[302:54.21]That's how I do it!
[303:00.23]I want to give myself ten times more work!
[303:04.19]Okay.
[303:08.85]This looks... like it goes over here.
[303:12.96]Alright, we need...
[303:17.58]Shield guy, top of shield guy's head, and bush.
[303:24.27]I might have a few over here that I'm missing.
[303:30.73]Shield guy is the last one, and then there's a tree over his head.
[303:34.33]There's a single tree trunk.
[303:38.06]So where the fuck is the single tree trunk?
[303:48.39]has to be over there somewhere in the pile I you see a single tree trunk I don't it's right it goes right there and you probably can't see very much of anything on that side one tree trunk
[304:29.57]got the right side done now just have to deal with the bottom here and we can continue to finish the puzzle which I'm very excited about I feel like I'm having a good old time here but we need to get this thing rolling this is over here okay
[304:55.05]So, uh, they can't be very many other options.
[304:57.95]This is definitely over here.
[304:59.07]Got it.
[305:00.36]Definitely right here.
[305:07.60]Fuck you then.
[305:11.54]Okay.
[305:14.01]Telling the truth.
[305:15.73]Is some joke like once he finishes the puzzle, he announces a new baseball stream?
[305:20.81]Uh, no.
[305:22.05]No, it's just a puzzle.
[305:24.20]just a puzzle and it's just me just six or seven hundred thousand of you this is definitely a right side bottom so close yet so far still it has to be made up of these pieces
[305:55.29]Let's go.
[305:55.51]Come on.
[305:55.85]Come on.
[305:56.17]Come on!
[306:06.45]Trees.
[306:07.46]Tree trunks.
[306:09.94]Tree trunk.
[306:11.96]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[306:13.44]Okay, trees.
[306:14.24]Tree trunk.
[306:17.91]Does this not go there?
[306:19.57]What's that not go there?
[306:21.55]Try flipping them upside down.
[306:22.59]Well these have to be the bottom.
[306:33.82]This whole quadrant is done.
[306:36.84]One or two more pieces to get down to here.
[306:43.16]That is good.
[306:44.24]This is good.
[306:49.04]It's not that.
[306:50.28]You've got to be kidding me.
[306:57.87]Does this connect to here?
[306:58.67]No, it doesn't.
[307:04.10]Shit.
[307:04.70]There.
[307:13.53]I still feel like that one is being annoying, but I feel like it's supposed to go there.
[307:17.45]Alright, where's the one with the tree?
[307:20.53]There it is.
[307:21.05]I need that to plug into here.
[307:41.26]There's another tree.
[307:45.05]This tree is over here.
[307:46.23]Oh, I'm sorry.
[307:47.15]Here.
[307:47.71]What the fuck?
[307:54.46]What goes into here?
[307:55.26]This is the edge.
[307:57.97]Corner, I mean.
[308:30.84]I really feel like some of these should fit.
[308:32.34]I just don't.
[308:32.88]That was like a Rick Sanchez.
[308:53.33]That was a Rick Sanchez in real life.
[308:56.55]I just want to make sure you know that.
[309:00.74]I really did that.
[309:01.84]That actually came out of my body.
[309:04.88]I wasn't doing like, oh, I'm doing Rick.
[309:06.46]No, I did that.
[309:07.44]For real.
[309:15.38]This is over here.
[309:41.45]It's light.
[309:43.11]It's light ones.
[309:51.96]Corner.
[309:53.20]Where's the other tree?
[309:54.32]Right in the middle.
[309:55.48]Right there.
[309:58.04]The double tree is here.
[309:59.40]And the triple tree is up there.
[310:04.24]Okay.
[310:06.33]It's just all bushes.
[310:07.25]I just have to make it work.
[310:08.45]I have to make it work.
[310:09.33]I have to make this work.
[310:11.52]all there is to it just there's no way to look it's just it's all bushes after this so just connect it it's been five hours
[310:39.96]Yeah, if you gotta go to bed, go to bed.
[310:41.10]I'm still here.
[310:45.41]I am of my own free will to be here.
[310:48.39]So don't worry.
[310:52.64]I'm gonna finish it.
[311:15.20]This is by far the worst part of the entire thing.
[311:18.56]Once this is done, I can actually get in there.
[311:22.27]Finish it.
[311:39.52]Wow.
[311:43.60]Go fix this one.
[311:50.84]all of chat did a puzzle with yeah you guys have 500 people working on it you don't get this green edge dog shit like I do you don't have the green edge shit you had green edges you'd be fucked
[312:19.61]Now we're getting into like this shit here.
[312:33.88]What do you say, man?
[312:40.30]All this bullshit.
[312:41.48]I didn't have the bullshit I would have been done an hour and a half ago.
[312:47.66]There's so many bushes to deal with.
[312:51.36]All bush shit.
[312:55.79]Okay.
[313:00.79]There's like a pine tree down here.
[313:04.94]Fuck these pieces even go.
[313:06.12]I want to get my iPhone and shine a light on these.
[313:34.08]I also might be running out of pieces that I... because I don't think any of these work.
[313:43.92]This doesn't look like it.
[313:48.12]No, it doesn't.
[313:48.86]How the fuck does that make any sense?
[313:55.82]Whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop!
[313:58.12]The fuck is that?
[314:05.34]don't understand this no no it's up it's so it's we have to return it we have to return it oh if you guys can see that alright okay yes
[314:33.93]To the left of those double trees here is more double tree, which that doesn't make any sense.
[314:42.10]Where's the top of the tree?
[314:44.64]Somewhere.
[314:45.14]I think I have some pieces that aren't here.
[314:55.61]The tree trunk.
[315:35.04]Alright, there's physically one piece left over here Camera's in the way.
[315:45.28]Hey, you didn't have a camera in the way either
[315:55.36]Oh there.
[315:55.76]I think I'm missing some stuff.
[316:24.63]the last piece of it.
[317:22.87]How the fuck is that possible?
[317:25.77]What?
[317:28.01]How many pieces long is the left side?
[317:29.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... It's 20 pieces, right?
[317:33.81]Not like 40 by... What?
[317:45.78]I worry for your neck and back.
[317:47.40]That is becoming a pretty major problem.
[317:50.10]I will tell you.
[317:52.49]But...
[317:53.90]If I can just get this fucking edge done.
[318:03.50]Why wouldn't I have done the castle?
[318:17.45]Okay, getting there.
[318:49.55]Triple trees are upside down.
[318:50.99]Those go like up here, don't they?
[319:06.96]Alright, I need one piece there.
[319:08.33]Which is one of those sideways pieces.
[319:12.53]Which I don't think I have this.
[319:13.99]What am I going to do?
[319:19.55]I definitely have pieces missing.
[319:21.79]Without a doubt.
[319:24.61]Unless it's this one.
[319:26.67]Ooh, it is that one!
[319:27.77]He's eating them.
[319:41.12]I have only eaten two!
[319:48.58]Alright.
[319:49.16]We are actually getting there.
[319:51.22]We're getting there.
[319:52.20]Actually getting there.
[319:52.94]Fucking piece of shit.
[320:06.83]It's not that way.
[320:07.29]It's not that way either.
[320:47.53]I actually think I can probably start to bring up new things, new pieces, very soon here.
[320:52.47]This edge has been so fucking painful.
[321:04.71]I need this piece here.
[321:07.49]Is this my song?
[321:12.29]Ooh, there's some good songs here.
[321:26.81]That's so much more complicated than I wanted to do right now To go this way, alright, what is next to the dragon?
[321:50.19]Right next to the dragon is
[321:53.21]bushes and then this thing right here so it's a bunch of fucking bushes here and then this good luck there's a tree right next to its face like a two-pronged tree oh my god it's gonna sound like a needle in a haystack
[322:34.38]Up here somewhere, it's like one of these pieces.
[322:50.06]There.
[323:06.95]Okay, now I can almost connect this.
[323:08.93]Are you seeing this?
[323:10.45]Are you witnessing?
[323:14.11]Because it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[323:17.59]Where's the other guy?
[323:18.69]Because that's how I can connect these.
[323:33.46]Who fucking knows?
[323:53.36]Found somebody's hair.
[323:54.12]Oh no, that's an egg.
[324:01.91]Finding stuff in the house.
[324:03.27]I found hair.
[324:05.65]Oh look, I found an egg over here.
[324:07.17]Wow.
[324:07.29]We're good.
[324:24.02]Almost weren't good, but we are.
[324:25.72]I'm going to have to concede defeat on this puzzle, I think.
[324:36.52]I can definitely finish it, but I don't know if I can stand for another two or three hours.
[324:42.42]My chest problem is starting to rear its ugly head.
[324:46.18]I think I can probably do it.
[324:54.58]give it another hour I'm done I probably should have sat a mistake on my part and it is my apology I should have thought about that but then again I didn't think I was going to be standing here for more than three and a half hours doing it that's a one it's one piece per hour that's how ridiculous this is how ridiculous this has been
[325:27.76]Still really wanted to complete the fucking edge.
[325:35.36]But then I got all the all this here is a whole nother nightmare.
[325:57.90]I have no idea
[326:28.38]They're like the drummers, but I need this bottom piece!
[326:31.60]I have to search.
[326:38.72]I was putting him on the ground.
[326:56.97]Way easier.
[327:00.84]I'll pull him up when I'm ready.
[327:14.50]It's gonna be the last piece I turn over.
[327:30.83]It's literally gonna be the last piece I turn on.
[327:45.28]Where are these spear guys?
[328:15.36]It's the spear guy's head.
[328:26.59]There's one, two, three, four, five, six spear guys.
[328:32.45]Where's the other spear guy?
[328:34.81]He's a whole piece.
[328:40.45]Check the ceiling.
[328:53.78]Plenty of purple dragons, but no spear guys.
[329:32.01]There are six spear guys and we're missing spear guy number five Fucking finally
[330:02.49]oh connect all of it please connect it all oh thank thank goodness okay I don't know what you wrote it was gone in literally half a second
[332:03.42]How could there be this many pieces and none of them fit together down here?
[332:07.24]This is the... That didn't go in before.
[332:13.41]It was a broken piece.
[332:18.87]That shit was broken.
[332:21.55]Guys, my... I don't...
[332:23.81]I don't understand what's going on.
[332:26.52]No, I'm pressing the buttons.
[332:28.60]Did I press A like five times?
[332:30.46]I think my control is broken.
[332:33.58]It is.
[332:34.66]Look.
[332:36.54]By the way, look at that.
[332:37.16]That was flipper two.
[332:38.78]Decal.
[332:43.03]Feels good to play.
[332:48.29]If this puzzle was a person, I'd punch it in the face, by the way.
[332:50.61]Okay.
[332:53.82]Just saying.
[333:00.18]I need three more pieces down here.
[333:12.06]Oh, clicking, clicking.
[333:17.04]Oh, look at what we got here.
[333:20.78]Oh, it feels so good when you get a whole chunk like that.
[333:36.19]Well, it has to be one of these three pieces.
[333:49.14]Okay.
[334:31.67]Alright.
[334:32.87]We... This is it.
[334:34.37]This is all we got left.
[334:35.91]We just gotta fill it in.
[334:37.59]We just gotta fill it in.
[334:40.97]Just gotta fill it in now.
[334:42.05]Alright.
[334:43.11]We just gotta fill it in.
[334:45.41]That sounded like I was cutting to do like a YouTube edit, but you know what I'm saying?
[334:48.32]We just gotta fill it in.
[334:50.32]Now let's go for that.
[334:51.66]Alright.
[334:52.88]So.
[334:54.72]What do I want to build first?
[334:57.50]What I want to build is I want to build up this...
[335:01.82]So we're going to take that.
[335:03.52]We're going to move some of these pieces out of here.
[335:05.76]Because we got some middle work to do here.
[335:11.70]Okay.
[335:26.93]Where's this piece?
[335:30.60]That's sort of ridiculous.
[335:31.54]Where's that piece?
[335:32.70]I'm missing a cloud piece?
[335:35.22]Are you shitting me?
[335:39.16]That doesn't make any sense.
[335:40.78]How could I have missed a cloud piece five hours into this?
[335:53.96]There's no way.
[335:56.70]There's no way that I missed a cloud piece.
[336:01.15]I'm disturbed right now.
[336:02.57]Okay, well, whatever.
[336:08.52]Alright, let me take a look at this.
[336:10.08]And now I have all the pieces pretty much turned over.
[336:12.42]Now it's time to start filling this in.
[336:14.92]So what is right above...
[336:18.19]This shit, okay, this is the dragon, right next to the dragon.
[336:22.91]This green one.
[336:24.25]It looks like red and a pillar.
[336:26.87]So it's this pillar, and it's red in the middle.
[336:29.31]I'm looking for red with a pillar shit.
[336:36.96]That's not quite it.
[336:42.68]You think you would have done that?
[336:56.81]Okay.
[336:57.81]Right below is bushes.
[337:00.29]And I don't know if I can get it yet.
[337:02.73]Right below is... Yeah, it's like a gray with a bush and a tree.
[337:10.44]Yeah, I don't know about that one right now.
[337:11.92]Yeah, that's going to be a little too difficult for right this second.
[337:17.48]Okay.
[337:22.05]let's I'm going to keep building this middle part right above the dragon is this kind of more of this sort of it looks like almost like a beveled edges which is right here and it's close but not really
[337:54.42]Not quite.
[337:55.10]Okay.
[338:00.64]There it is.
[338:01.16]Yes!
[338:04.46]Keep building up.
[338:11.34]It's gonna start to get really lightning fast here.
[338:14.30]It's gonna start to really speed the heck up.
[338:21.42]I would hold on to something.
[338:33.13]That's on the left side.
[338:36.38]That's on the left side, and that's connected to here.
[338:43.08]Lessons done.
[338:44.82]Now we can build from there, which there is plenty of space.
[338:58.57]I'm going to stick with here.
[339:13.80]Told you it was going to start to get a little faster once I could actually get in there.
[339:22.03]Once I could actually cut through all the crap.
[339:28.23]Wait, what's wrong with that?
[339:33.01]Always down.
[339:33.91]Okay, they're like up there.
[339:40.19]Hmm What
[340:07.42]Can you turn anti-aliasing on?
[340:09.56]Um, I think it's just every webcam sucks.
[340:12.18]Asshole.
[340:12.46]Uh, I don't do like a, I don't do a, like a DSLR or anything.
[340:18.78]I've only been a webcam Andy the whole time.
[340:20.50]And they suck.
[340:22.48]Can you find me a webcam that actually has like a great picture?
[340:27.09]Can run at 60 FPS?
[340:30.15]Isn't a piece of fucking dog shit?
[340:33.43]Sign me up.
[340:36.26]I've had a problem with every webcam I've ever bought in my whole life.
[340:39.44]Every single one.
[340:40.06]Alright, slow it down.
[340:55.23]What am I... What is the wing of?
[341:02.57]This is the wing of this dragon.
[341:07.13]really weird spot but it went yes okay you run such high production shows but then you can't get your own webcam I mean all every webcam I've ever had was terrible even the ones that are like oh this is like an amazing expensive one those things were fucking dog shit too
[341:37.34]Stop using a webcam.
[341:40.71]I mean, I'm only going to be streaming like... I mean, I stream like once a month.
[341:45.25]Okay.
[341:45.47]I don't think I need to do a DSLR setup right now.
[341:52.85]I don't even stream in 1080p.
[341:57.51]This is a window.
[341:58.43]That is... Oh no.
[342:09.61]I must have this done.
[342:13.13]Just filling in spots.
[342:17.21]Where's the guy with the green face?
[342:26.65]Do it by like eyeballing it.
[342:28.27]This is the top.
[342:53.30]oh okay okay I'm removing all green that's a weird looking one I think I should know what that one just is
[343:22.93]That is like the exact same piece.
[343:24.93]I'm surprised it does not fit.
[343:26.75]It's like the same exact shape.
[343:32.76]It's a little different.
[343:33.42]How far away is the dragon?
[343:56.67]Looks like right here.
[344:00.15]He's right here.
[344:03.24]Is it Dragon's face?
[344:04.12]Fuck.
[344:31.53]I just made that harder for you to see, but... For some reason, I have the absolute worst possible setup right now.
[344:55.45]Like, the worst.
[344:57.35]The light is in the perfect spot to wash out the whole thing.
[345:02.00]I'm... I... What the hell was I thinking?
[345:05.28]What was I thinking?
[345:05.78]Should I sit down?
[345:10.06]If I sit down, I'm gonna be laying down here.
[345:13.94]Because this table is, like... I'm gonna say, it's pretty high off the ground.
[345:19.48]It's a pretty tall table.
[345:28.97]I'm close.
[345:34.09]Every time I lean in, I'm just white.
[345:52.27]Get a booster seat?
[345:53.19]Nah.
[345:55.17]I made that somehow worse but better at the same time.
[345:58.86]I don't know how the fuck I managed that.
[346:06.36]shit I have to call it nobody bet any money on this right oh just my back is killing me uh let me sit down for five minutes I'll sit right here
[346:42.39]Did you see any good movies?
[346:43.67]Okay.
[346:55.10]Because I think we've gotten to probably, like, the part that really wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[347:09.71]But...
[347:12.23]I just don't know, man.
[347:15.11]I don't know.
[347:15.95]What I need to do, it's really not that much left.
[347:24.79]It really isn't.
[347:25.47]It's like, it is actually like probably 50 pieces.
[347:28.99]What is the most painful, most obnoxious part of the whole puzzle?
[347:32.21]Which is like all green, like oops, all fucking berries.
[347:34.40]It's like really all it is.
[347:48.49]There's probably a hundred pieces at least.
[347:49.98]I think it's less than that.
[348:20.23]My work zone is is not good
[348:59.85]All the dragon shit, because then I can actually just build the middle.
[349:18.33]There somewhere.
[349:33.14]have to build it down here goodbye all the green see you later deal with you another time why are you physically torturing yourself
[349:57.82]Because I have made this setup a certain way, and it would need, I would need to, it would take like a half an hour to get it to a different setup, so.
[350:07.53]Because I'd have to move my shit out of the way, I'd have to get a chair, because I'm like, I'm pretty much right against the wall.
[350:14.60]So, I, yeah, it's, it's working for right now.
[350:28.86]be a stool.
[350:30.54]It actually might be tall enough.
[350:34.02]Ooh, I... Thank you, sir.
[350:38.42]Oh!
[350:38.98]Let's see.
[350:41.40]I have another... I have a new problem, though.
[350:45.39]This is a bad table.
[350:47.09]Like, I'm reaching across the entire table.
[350:51.31]Like, this is how far I have to go.
[350:53.39]It's huge.
[350:54.81]This table is so long.
[350:56.25]It's crazy.
[350:56.87]Alright.
[350:58.01]Alright.
[350:59.30]I got it.
[350:59.60]No more complaining.
[351:02.50]It's a jigsaw puzzle.
[351:04.18]Not Dark Souls.
[351:05.50]Just do it.
[351:06.10]Okay.
[351:18.31]I completed all of Limgrave and you're still here?
[351:21.08]Well, you're probably going to be able to do Caelid and I'll probably still be sitting here.
[351:24.10]Alright, I need a piece that goes into here.
[351:31.74]Not quite.
[351:36.48]They're all just such goofy pieces.
[351:52.67]They changed like shading.
[351:53.95]I don't even know how I ripped this.
[352:01.59]It's like changes.
[352:02.44]She can't even it doesn't come up on camera, but it's like this like three different colors in here Okay What are the mac and cheese we got over there Yeah, I shouldn't she doesn't Um, no, it's good right there I can see it from here
[352:38.89]So what side is that one on?
[352:42.25]It's the duck.
[352:42.93]The duck is on the left side.
[352:43.95]Everything's just surrounded by bushes.
[352:59.76]I actually think I need to, it needs to be like right, literally right here.
[353:03.32]I don't think I can physically do it because there's so many little details that it's just not possible.
[353:11.34]Great.
[353:11.58]It's like over here.
[353:21.99]Okay.
[353:28.44]Right above that, or right to the right of that is... the top of the cathedral?
[353:35.15]I don't know if this is cathedral or something?
[353:39.65]Door, and then there's a bunch of windows in a row.
[353:42.43]Like that.
[353:47.32]Okay.
[353:49.60]To the left of that door is the peak of one of these blue towers.
[354:01.53]Purple guy.
[354:02.23]The peak of a blue tower.
[354:12.39]Yep, okay.
[354:18.08]Underneath that I need the rest of the blue tower.
[354:19.96]Is there any weird shit?
[354:24.40]Oh, it's just blue.
[354:26.64]Just blue.
[354:33.48]welcome to the city what oh yeah you know that song welcome to the city yeah I love that one too I should think if I turn that light off it'll be better now now that I'm sitting
[355:12.02]okay so that looks pretty good getting there what is right above the door here is a shaded three windows shaded
[355:40.82]Uh, three windows.
[355:41.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[355:47.63]Good.
[355:49.97]And then... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[355:52.63]Where's the king?
[355:54.45]There you are.
[355:54.99]Okay, then above that is the peak and the tail of the green dragon.
[356:31.05]We've got a full vertical connection.
[356:37.14]Full vertical connection engaged.
[356:43.10]Alright.
[356:44.18]I still need a right side of the peak here for here.
[356:47.44]That one.
[356:53.47]Which I think I saw that.
[356:54.77]That's not it.
[357:09.51]Look at that I'm moving I am I am this is a sprinting pace now I am sprinting Okay, hey look at this Sprinting
[357:45.86]quite not quite where's there it is this should click into here oh it's because it clicks into here duck what
[358:22.10]Smoothing it out.
[358:23.30]There's only green bullshit left after this.
[358:25.74]Where's this piece?
[358:45.63]Over here.
[359:08.57]Right there, somewhere too.
[359:10.22]Where's this house?
[359:11.40]This lid.
[359:15.52]Right to the bottom of this.
[359:20.22]There.
[359:23.12]I'm cooking, look!
[359:25.16]I am baking goods right now.
[359:27.38]I'm actually doing very well.
[359:30.66]I'm very happy about how things are progressing here.
[359:34.14]Okay, now what's right?
[359:39.58]What's to the left of this?
[359:49.00]First of all...
[360:17.81]I can't just do it by eyeballing it.
[360:19.41]I need to know where the hell I'm going.
[360:20.55]Alright, where... There's a second peak.
[360:25.11]I believe the second peak is right here.
[360:27.45]Because that's the big one.
[360:30.88]That's the tall one.
[360:34.92]That should... Does it not?
[360:35.86]Actually, no.
[360:37.78]Shit.
[360:46.70]He's already looking way too busy.
[360:48.37]Yeah, I'm looking busy because I'm trying to get this done.
[360:55.25]I need to stand.
[361:03.87]It's just too far away to see it.
[361:05.15]Oh, fuck you.
[361:18.40]Stop with this nonsense.
[361:19.46]Finish this part here.
[361:20.44]Kind of yellow.
[361:29.47]It's like yellowy.
[361:33.57]Okay.

[364:55.26]It's a mountain.
[365:07.02]Put the milk.
[365:34.13]This is much better.
[365:35.15]I'm so much happier now than I was 30 to 40 minutes ago.

[366:37.88]We're almost done.
[366:39.62]We don't have very much left.
[366:40.98]It's just finesse at this point.
[366:44.07]Things are looking great.
[366:45.19]Things are looking up.
[367:03.49]Uh-huh.
[367:05.87]Looking for another peak.
[367:06.91]Uh-huh.
[367:16.58]Check this out.
[367:19.15]Pieces are just falling in there now.
[367:24.83]Absolutely falling in there now.
[367:29.53]Purple dragon is beginning up here.
[367:35.79]We're going to move him out of the way for now.

[368:07.52]I actually don't, I can't hear it.
[368:09.64]The music is for you.
[368:10.58]It's to just have chill music in the background while I have a chill stream where I just start, you know, yelling about fucking green puzzle pieces the whole time.
[368:21.31]Okay, second puzzle.
[368:29.67]Say, yeah, I'm gonna have a chill stream where I do a jigsaw puzzle, and then I'm gonna complain about the puzzle for four straight hours.
[368:35.19]I just can't be helped.
[368:44.98]I just can't be helped.
[368:45.94]I really can't be helped.
[368:48.56]I just can't be helped, you know what I mean?
[368:50.38]Like, I just, this is the way it is.
[368:56.10]Look at how cool, look at how this is coming together.

[387:50.80]Actually, after you turn like 11, you can't really make those jokes anymore.
[387:57.90]Give me a little bit extra time.
[388:01.33]I put my finger on my nose.
[388:12.85]I shoved my finger up my nose.

[389:30.11]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[389:33.45]Critics are saying Jack Black puts in an unbelievable performance.
[389:39.14]Kung Fu Bandit 4.
[389:41.04]I rated PG.
[389:48.89]Steve Stevens of the New York Times says, I laughed until I peed myself.
[389:55.10]Jack Black 4.
[389:57.72]Rated PG.
[390:13.69]Come on.
[390:14.11]We must bend it to our will.
[390:20.35]Bend the puzzle to our will even if it doesn't go in.
[390:25.13]We mold the world around us.
[390:28.86]It won't go in.
[390:30.60]I've made that joke like five times and it was funny all five times.
[390:33.94]At least I think so.
[390:47.32]they're slowed down to a crawl I have like 12 pieces to put in where just put them in man they're right here just put them in I'm they're right here just put them in look six the mound

[393:40.51]What is that?
[393:43.59]What is that?
[393:48.73]There's no wrong way to eat a fucking Reese's.
[393:55.33]I'm going to let that one play because Reese's is my favorite candy.
[394:04.88]So that one gets to play.
[394:13.14]I just have these just neat.
[394:15.06]I'm just going to match them by shape.
[394:19.34]Bye.
[394:45.35]This is fucking ludicrous.
[394:47.11]Like, what?
[394:47.87]How?
[394:48.33]This is... Look at this piece.
[394:51.63]You see the turquoise?

[395:45.22]I finished my puzzle five hours ago.
[395:46.86]Yeah!
[395:54.13]What do you want me to do?

[396:04.66]Why would- You- No, you bless me!
[396:06.02]That's- No, I need your power.
[396:07.52]You bless me instead.
[396:20.23]I'm the one that's going slow, not you.
[396:23.75]By the way, we don't know what puzzle you did.
[396:27.13]You could have opened up a Sesame Street puzzle with Elmo and Cookie Monster, and it was nine pieces, and you could be accurate.
[396:37.62]This was 300.
[396:38.50]This was 300 puzzle pieces.
[396:39.56]This was hard, okay?
[396:40.52]This was a hard puzzle.
[396:44.18]This was a hard one.
[396:51.26]There was a lot going on.
[396:52.60]Look at how much is going on here.
[396:54.82]This isn't just like a solid blue thing.
[396:58.98]Look at how much is happening under this canvas.
[397:01.97]Okay.
[397:07.51]Where did these go?
[397:08.33]Where's the sheet?
[397:10.67]Okay.
[397:19.17]I want this to go up there so bad, but it doesn't go up there.
[397:21.41]13.
[397:36.68]I'm knocking other pieces out accidentally.
[397:38.42]Get out of here.
[397:38.94]Hey, hey, hey.
[397:42.67]Cut it out.
[398:01.05]14 where is this one 15
[398:29.89]when you picture a cat lady house in your head it probably doesn't look like this but guess what my friends it's 2024 and cat ladies can have beautiful interiors too thanks to collections like Nate and Jeremiah for pet smart what is this ad for beautifully designed pieces that can seamlessly blend in with

[402:03.78]It was, it was violent.
[402:19.48]I'm done.
[402:20.20]I finished it.
[402:20.92]It's over.
[402:21.43]I did it.
[402:22.23]I finished it.
[402:22.69]Look.
[402:23.63]I actually finished it.
[402:25.33]It's just these stupid pieces that I just don't know where they go.
[402:28.35]20.
[402:33.79]I'm going to stop counting.
[402:39.77]Hold on.
[402:40.09]Here it is.
[402:40.77]Really?
[402:42.93]You're going to do this to me right now?
[402:47.13]you're actually gonna do this to me nothing else even fits there how could you possibly do this to me excuse me 21
[403:19.44]Alright sitting there three
[403:46.74]Like a prank puzzle?
[403:49.35]Oh no, that would be funny.
[403:50.83]Make a prank puzzle and have it be a 500 piece puzzle and have there be 600 pieces in the box.
[403:57.15]100 of them don't have anything to do with this puzzle.
[403:59.75]Oh, that would be awful.
[404:00.81]And make them kind of look like they match.
[404:07.89]I'm so right there.
[404:13.27]I just need to get it in the right spot.
[405:01.02]Spike.
[405:08.81]Hey, hey, look, look, look.
[405:12.11]Look who just finished a 3,000 piece Omega puzzle.
[405:29.83]I got a little help from chat.
[405:31.03]They did tell me where a few things were, but this is 3,000 pieces.
[405:33.07]Took me about four and a half hours, which I'm very happy with that time.
[405:39.20]Could have been a little shorter, and I could have...
[406:34.35]okay guys okay the only reason why I did this stream was just to chill and do a puzzle but that's not what it really was it was a big joke because when he puts the last piece in he's gonna go to put it in and he's gonna sh
[406:52.35]smear his hands all over it and ruin everything.
[406:54.47]Look at all this green shit.
[407:07.15]I didn't think I was going to do it.
[407:08.68]Neither did I. But here we are.
[407:28.71]uh we have a problem we have a small problem there's a there's a missing piece small problem not a big one but big enough
[407:53.24]What's missing?
[407:56.70]Okay, it's some green shit.
[407:59.14]That there?
[408:06.48]Looks kind of nice.
[408:16.41]Oh, hey.
[408:17.41]Hey.
[408:23.78]Got something behind your ear.
[408:24.60]This is the second camp, which is ruining the trick.
[408:52.47]But hold on.
[408:53.71]I didn't say anything.
[408:54.47]I didn't say a toast.
[408:57.33]Please raise your glasses, everybody.
[408:58.67]Come on.
[409:03.50]I just want to say that bride and groom over there look fantastic.
[409:09.60]I remember, you know, I went to college with the groom over there.
[409:14.84]But today's my day.
[409:21.34]Please raise your glasses to me completing this 300-piece puzzle at your shitty wedding.
[409:30.51]Had a lot of time.
[409:34.05]Yay!
[409:35.23]I did it!
[409:35.89]12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
[409:43.24]I've just been fucking around for seven hours.
[409:49.75]What did I do all day?
[409:53.47]That was fun.
[409:59.55]This one was tricky.
[410:01.09]This one was tough.
[410:03.75]I want better lighting next time, too.
[410:05.79]Because you can see, but I want a good quality camera pointing at this.
[410:14.36]That was a lot of fun.
[410:16.84]But take a look.
[410:17.70]Okay, see like... Like all this...
[410:23.30]all this on here because the in here could have been potentially down here same thing as up here the color is a little different but it's really really not this is cool this is I like I like the dragons I like the old medieval stuff too this is a good one this is tricky but it was a good one
[410:53.42]We should break it down?
[410:54.22]No, no.
[410:59.37]I want to like... First of all, I need to take a look.
[411:03.81]I don't know what's happening over here.
[411:10.49]I like it.
[411:13.78]Who made this puzzle?
[411:15.32]Nice job.
[411:16.83]It's the Imagine Dragons puzzle.
[411:19.04]I completely forgot this.
[411:20.56]Those of you that came to the stream like three or four hours later, this is an Imagine Dragons puzzle with the band Imagine Dragons.
[411:29.14]I think it's a fan made.
[411:31.44]I don't know exactly, but it was very good.
[411:36.12]I'm going to give it an A+, except for the green stuff.
[411:41.62]I didn't like that part because it was hard, and I don't like hard things.
[411:46.32]I only like when things are really easy.
[411:48.28]But, oh yeah, let me pass me that.
[411:50.80]Let me see.
[411:52.69]This is the one, this is the other one.
[411:55.69]We had an opportunity to do, like, cats at the beach.
[412:00.70]So, there'll be another, there'll be more.
[412:02.58]Alright.
[412:05.92]Let me ask you guys a question.
[412:07.70]This was just like a do this.
[412:09.62]I was going to do it until it was done.
[412:10.74]I definitely will be seated a lot longer next time.
[412:14.72]I thought that was a good time.
[412:16.92]I'm going to have a poll run to the chat right now.
[412:21.67]Do you want to see the cat puzzle at some point?
[412:27.03]Would you like a cat puzzle?
[412:32.23]Yeah.
[412:32.35]Yeah.
[412:34.98]I want to get better lighting to make it so it's like maybe isolate this a little better.
[412:38.58]So it's easier for you to see.
[412:45.25]That cat puzzle will be easier because I think the pieces are a little bit bigger.
[412:49.07]There's less pieces, it's bigger.
[412:50.35]And I think it's, I think it'd be easier for me to see and separate the images better.
[412:59.13]That's an overwhelming yes.
[413:00.35]Okay.
[413:02.89]Well, hell yeah.
[413:05.48]Oh, shit.
[413:05.90]Alright.
[413:06.18]Yeah.
[413:06.60]Cool.
[413:08.39]That was great.
[413:11.05]Yeah, I'll do the cat one.
[413:12.55]But then the next time you see me, I'm going to do the mac and cheese review stream.
[413:16.57]So let me get these back over here.
[413:22.43]I didn't show this one.
[413:24.35]Oh, the ones that I... Here, of course.
[413:26.17]This is like the... This is the Kraft mac and cheese deluxe edition.
[413:31.47]So... People like it.
[413:35.29]find out uh I am missing the trader Joe's mac and cheese and there's one more trader Joe's and stouffer's are the two I didn't no I don't think I have stouffer's did I say I had stouffer's I might so those are those are the ones
[414:01.67]I like how long the hair is.
[414:02.59]It's so funny.
[414:04.37]That first episode of Unpaid Intern, I was in it.
[414:07.96]And I remember reading a couple things in the comments.
[414:10.20]People were like, this had to be filmed in like November or October or something of last year.
[414:14.98]Because look at how long his hair is.
[414:17.22]Because I got my hair cut.
[414:18.84]So now it's just, I got it cut.
[414:24.18]See you all next time in another nine months.
[414:30.50]No, I want to do that.
[414:32.34]So just keep an eye on the stuff.
[414:35.99]I imagine you'll see that in the next week or two.
[414:38.81]I really want to do that because it's been sitting around.
[414:41.41]I want to get it done because I actually genuinely think that'd be a fun time.
[414:44.91]So we'll do that.
[414:46.69]Thank you for watching.
[414:47.53]Thanks for hanging out.
[414:48.27]This has been the Imagine Dragons 300 difficult piece.
[414:55.02]Difficult piece.
[414:56.56]Puzzle.
[414:58.42]I had fun.
[414:58.86]I hope you guys did too.
[415:00.58]If you did, I'll see you again.
[415:08.66]I'm already messing it up.
[415:14.37]Okay.
[415:15.71]Yeah.
[415:17.79]That's it.
[415:19.63]I'll see you later.
[415:23.51]Maybe I'll give you a date range.
[415:25.51]Let's see here.
[415:27.80]Is it 8th?
[415:31.42]Yeah.
[415:32.42]Keep an eye on the stuff over the next week or two.
[415:35.00]Because I want to get this done before the end of March.
[415:39.66]Alright.
[415:40.24]See you guys later.
[415:41.00]Take care.
[415:41.78]Have a great night.
[415:48.20]Oh, that is an empty cinema.
[415:51.17]This is the cinema we were looking for.
[415:57.07]And...
[416:12.96]uh there are a lot of subscriptions I am going to reiterate again I didn't post anything in the Discord because I don't know I feel like I do I really need to make a statement about all this I feel like I've made the statement like a thousand times on stream
[416:28.76]But I am no longer considered a, I would say, a streamer.
[416:34.90]So if you have a subscription and you want to use it, I would say use it on somebody else.
[416:41.77]There are a lot of great streamers that are very, very, very active.
[416:46.87]not to say you will never see me again but I do think that there are a lot of people that deserve that sub that are not me especially if I'm only going to be live like once or twice a month if that maybe yeah he's retiring again
[417:10.78]No, I have to retire every single stream because there's probably a few thousand people that have not heard me say that yet.
[417:17.84]So I have to retire every stream.
[417:37.08]Is there...
[417:40.79]I'll keep giving you my money until it falls out of my cold, dead hands.
[417:45.95]Well, I cannot.
[417:48.33]And I mean, I don't know.
[417:49.29]I think my partnership might like run out one of these days.
[417:53.05]I got to see what actually.
[417:55.49]Oh, shit.
[417:57.17]I got to figure that out.
[418:03.68]Will I lose like transcoding?
[418:08.40]If I just, like, don't give a shit and just don't even fucking up, I don't even care.
[418:11.92]What happens?
[418:18.08]Oh.
[418:20.16]Probably would need to at least up the partnership so I can still have transcoding.
[418:28.90]That's a problem for another day.
[418:36.67]That's a problem for next week.
[418:57.71]Still with my affiliate status, I think.
[418:59.61]Pretty lenient on that, yeah.
[419:05.57]Yeah, well, I gotta figure that out because I think my Twitch partnership, I think, ends soon.
[419:13.24]So, I don't know.
[419:15.28]But yeah, I'm gonna show up when I show up.
[419:20.44]And we'll do more puzzles and eat mac and cheese and it'll be swell.
[419:25.38]See you guys in the next week or two.
[419:27.20]Have a wonderful, wonderful rest of your night.
[419:31.36]Good to catch up and good to see everybody again.
[419:34.76]I'll see you again.
[419:36.50]Next time I am live, I will be eating a bunch of different mac and cheese.
[419:41.28]Hopefully it's good.
[419:42.41]Take care.
[419:44.73]Call your mother.
[419:45.21]See you guys later.
[419:47.85]Have a good one.
