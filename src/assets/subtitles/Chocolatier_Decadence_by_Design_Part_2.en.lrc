[00:01.59]PlayStation stream.
[00:02.57]Go to the PlayStation.
[00:04.93]PlayStation Direct.
[00:05.99]No, no, no.
[00:07.61]No, I'm not.
[00:08.29]I'm not watching another direct.
[00:11.49]The last one disappointed me.
[00:13.01]I'm not what?
[00:13.77]For me to learn what?
[00:14.55]What are we going to learn on this direct?
[00:18.81]PlayStation Direct.
[00:23.63]PlayStation Direct.
[00:25.55]It actually is called PlayStation Direct.
[00:32.03]PlayStation Direct.
[00:34.31]No, this is like a shipping company.
[00:37.67]Wait, PlayStation Direct.
[00:40.30]Limited time only.
[00:41.54]Free shipping on your entire order with any accessories purchased of $60 or more.
[00:47.66]Must meet order threshold of $60.
[00:48.90]Some customers may be affected by... Okay.
[00:55.23]Watch it.
[00:56.45]No, I don't want to watch the PlayStation.
[00:58.69]Okay, when did it start?
[01:00.20]When did it start?
[01:06.88]30 minutes ago?
[01:07.44]Alright.
[01:07.84]And how long is it going to go?
[01:09.54]You give me updates, okay?
[01:15.32]When the Ratchet and Clank IRL movie comes out, you just let me know when they announce it.
[01:25.42]I'm not watching another Direct.
[01:26.52]Not unless it's one I want to watch.
[01:32.07]I know more of those.
[01:32.83]It just ended.
[01:37.19]You haven't missed anything?
[01:39.83]It ended when you started.
[01:40.85]Oh, so you've just fucked with me.
[01:42.03]Okay.
[01:46.00]It was a Crash Bandicoot.
[01:49.60]Yeah.
[01:51.70]They'll keep making Crash Bandicoot.
[01:56.89]I never was concerned they wouldn't do it.
[02:02.67]Ever since they did the the insane trilogy.
[02:06.43]Come on, of course they're going to do another one.
[02:10.65]Elden Ring.
[02:15.62]No, there was the hold on.
[02:16.86]Was there an Elden Ring thing?
[02:19.28]What has it been on the PlayStation 1?
[02:23.30]Elden Ring leaks posted by impatient fans are fake.
[02:29.58]Okay.
[02:31.94]Elden Ring insider shares update.
[02:34.72]Okay.
[02:36.48]That's not real.
[02:43.17]Whatever.
[02:44.73]You tell me what happens.
[02:48.23]You know, sitting there for 60 minutes with my fingers in my mouth, just biting my fingernails.
[02:51.99]Are they going to announce?
[02:53.06]Are they going to announce Super Street Fighter 7?
[02:56.74]No, I can read it in a tweet.
[02:58.92]Five minutes after the thing's over.
[03:01.94]I'd rather relax and just like make chocolates.
[03:05.12]And then, oh, wait a minute.
[03:06.92]Elden Ring has an announcement?
[03:09.34]Date?
[03:10.74]Oh, okay.
[03:11.34]I can be in the bathtub and read that.
[03:14.16]It's too much.
[03:14.84]Too much stress.
[03:18.59]I lived through that.
[03:19.49]I did that shit.
[03:20.49]I lived through that.
[03:21.39]And I don't want to live through that again.
[03:24.17]I remember Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
[03:27.39]Sakurai would do weekly Friday updates.
[03:31.74]Announcing a new character or a new thing that was in the game.
[03:35.44]And that was what you did.
[03:36.58]It was at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[03:39.14]And it was all I cared about.
[03:40.94]Oh my god, is this the day?
[03:41.90]Oh my god, is Donkey Kong in this one?
[03:46.08]It consumed like four months of my life.
[03:49.69]And then I played Brawl for probably a total of... Oh, no, no, no.
[03:54.29]That's the one I played a lot of.
[03:55.79]Yeah, that was worth it.
[04:03.05]It's so funny because Brawl is the one that I put all the time into.
[04:05.66]And it's the one that everybody says is the worst one.
[04:10.30]Right?
[04:10.68]By a lot.
[04:12.30]I thought it was fun.
[04:13.66]But I know that most people say that that's the absolute worst one.
[04:18.44]It's the one I actually played.
[04:22.18]Meta Knight was in the game.
[04:23.34]Oh yeah, I remember people playing Meta Knight.
[04:25.56]They just turned into the drill and just flew around and just won every single match.
[04:28.77]I remember that.
[04:33.85]Brawl was the best casual one.
[04:35.41]Yeah, I mean it was fun.
[04:37.21]That's the one I put all the time into.
[04:38.33]Why don't you stream the awful PlayStation Direct?
[04:49.45]No, we're not doing that.
[04:53.46]We are gonna- I'm gonna just change the camera because- Wait, I didn't even tweet this.
[04:56.11]I'm not even here.
[04:56.59]I'll be right back.
[06:15.87]This shit ended an hour ago.
[06:18.08]You liars.
[06:18.94]This ended like a full hour ago.
[06:22.82]I'm sitting here being like, eh, maybe I should stream this.
[06:25.32]Eh, maybe it's almost, maybe there'll be an announcement at the end.
[06:27.32]There's nothing on here.
[06:28.40]This was like over.
[06:30.48]It ended seven minutes ago.
[06:31.76]Well, then look.
[06:33.22]Then, good, it was good I didn't stream it.
[06:36.22]Because guess what?
[06:37.58]I don't see anybody talking about anything in this direct.
[06:42.89]I've seen like two things that people thought was cool.
[06:47.20]It would have been spammed if something huge was announced.
[06:51.09]So, what?
[06:52.33]Whatever.
[06:52.85]Alright, I'm ready.
[06:53.67]I didn't even tweet anything.
[06:55.20]I'll be right back.
[07:13.32]Do I not know how to spell chocolate so badly that my iPhone thought I was trying to say cholesterol?
[07:22.33]How do you spell it?
[07:22.89]It's cho-co-late, right?
[07:26.80]Cho-co-late.
[07:29.66]Factory.
[07:31.92]Entrepreneur.
[07:36.43]Holy shit.
[07:37.55]Chocolate.
[07:38.23]Fav-tory.
[07:39.55]Entry.
[07:40.25]Nor.
[07:40.85]Near.
[07:41.23]I can't type.
[07:42.91]I hate these fucking things.
[07:44.60]I hate phones.
[07:46.04]I hate them.
[07:46.64]I don't want them anymore.
[07:47.60]I don't want to use this phone anymore.
[07:48.92]Fucking try.
[07:49.58]Get me by goddamn.
[07:52.76]Send a telegram.
[08:01.45]I'm going to give you guys a stream notification by telegram.
[08:08.87]Alright, hold on.
[08:09.39]I'm almost ready.
[08:12.43]PlayStation Direct.
[08:18.54]Dude, what do you think would happen if Super Mario was announced for PlayStation?
[08:24.24]What would happen?
[08:28.82]I think Twitter would go down.
[08:34.61]Like, if it was like, Super Mario!
[08:37.64]It's 8 or something.
[08:39.19]Like, Super Mario Galaxy 3 was on PlayStation 5.
[08:41.75]What do you think happened?
[08:47.63]Chocolate factory entrepreneur.
[08:48.37]Alright, there we go.
[08:48.81]Alright, we're going to pick up where we left off yesterday.
[08:51.52]I really like this game.
[08:52.26]I think it's fun.
[08:53.84]That would make no sense.
[08:55.56]I know that would make no fucking sense.
[09:02.48]That would make absolutely no sense.
[09:07.63]That's a good dream that you have, right?
[09:10.07]What I just said was so stupid and just so like, I'm just stalling to make a tweet that you have a dream where that happens.
[09:21.54]And it's a dream that you forget when you wake up.
[09:23.88]It's so asinine and just so just not important at all.
[09:28.50]That's the ones you forget.
[09:31.38]What the fuck was that dream?
[09:32.50]I don't know.
[09:33.16]Something about like game.
[09:34.00]I don't know.
[09:34.76]I forget it.
[09:35.18]It was so fucking inconsequential to me.
[09:40.37]Alright, let's go.
[09:40.93]This camera not on, right?
[09:46.34]I'm always so paranoid about this shit.
[09:48.06]I swear to God.
[09:49.60]Oh, wait, hold on.
[09:55.58]Need to go into full screen, man.
[09:58.96]Ooh, I remember this music.
[10:06.63]What the fuck?
[10:07.21]Naked.
[10:07.97]Yeah, you wish.
[10:11.58]Alright, so where we left off, if you missed the last stream, this is Chocolatier.
[10:18.76]I forget, I don't know, there's a hashtag.
[10:20.74]Not a hashtag, there's a colon.
[10:22.66]It's called, it's just Chocolatier.
[10:25.18]You make chocolates.
[10:26.78]You have to fly around the world, buy ingredients, make money.
[10:29.72]If you weren't here yesterday, you missed a lot of money.
[10:35.60]The last thing I was doing, we have a quest log here.
[10:37.80]Right, okay, I remember.
[10:40.55]It was gambling.
[10:41.17]Yes, there is.
[10:41.65]But I'm not going to go do that right now.
[10:42.95]I'm going to just chill and play.
[10:44.55]I got to do my quests.
[10:49.98]That was disgusting.
[10:51.04]I'm sad that that got picked up by the microphone.
[10:56.78]Alright.
[10:57.02]So I got coffee here.
[10:59.68]This is my Cuban clock cleaner.
[11:02.42]It's got Cayenne pepper, Cuban coffee, and honey.
[11:05.69]If I'm not mistaken.
[11:07.43]This is a huge cellar.
[11:12.76]And then I'm making a special reserve.
[11:14.62]Right.
[11:14.94]I'm making it for a reason, though.
[11:15.90]I have 40 cases of Arabian Bold in inventory.
[11:20.78]I'm going to go back to this fine coffee maker here.
[11:22.63]I have two cases of... Oh, wait.
[11:24.87]This guy.
[11:25.19]The guy that gave us the tip.
[11:26.31]I forgot about this guy.
[11:28.75]He doesn't want very much.
[11:29.57]Okay.
[11:30.13]We'd have to give him two cases of raspberry.
[11:32.60]24 cases of cafe con leche.
[11:35.32]Okay.
[11:36.93]Alright, 34 cases of special 66% African cacao reserves.
[11:41.83]Which I should have.
[11:43.25]Talk to, um, oh wait, we have to go back to this person?
[11:49.50]Wait.
[11:56.00]This guy wants to bring two cases of raspberry, and he gave us a recipe, but he also wants 34 cases of the special reserve for a recipe.
[12:07.69]Okay.
[12:09.11]So I gotta make the raspberry ones, too.
[12:10.72]I can't go back empty-handed here.
[12:11.94]Alright, let's go back to the chocolate factory.
[12:20.12]Leche means milk.
[12:23.23]Why is that confusing you?
[12:26.43]Look, it's been a day.
[12:28.93]The chocolate arc.
[12:29.97]That's right.
[12:30.47]Alright, so what do we got?
[12:32.71]I have 30, okay, I need 34 of the special reserve.
[12:35.57]I have 34 cube and clock cleaners.
[12:37.18]This is gonna be a fucking huge sale.
[12:39.54]Oh, that's not good.
[12:41.14]No, no, I'm not selling it here.
[12:42.82]Get out of here with these low prices.
[12:48.48]What else do I need to make?
[12:49.12]I need to continue making this.
[12:52.34]Almost out of peppers.
[12:54.52]I gotta change what coffee I'm making, but first of all...
[12:58.61]I'm just going to make this right now and I'm going to change it to raspberry.
[13:03.27]Because we need a bunch of these.
[13:05.23]Make it.
[13:05.59]Here we go.
[13:06.83]Let's see how rusty I am.
[13:11.32]Put poison in the coffee.
[13:14.24]Well, you're a psycho.
[13:19.00]Hey dude, I got a wicked good idea of how you can really grow your business.
[13:22.34]Put poison in the coffee.
[13:24.72]I think your business would not last very long.
[13:30.34]You'd be out of business very shortly.
[13:37.78]Put poison in the coffee.
[13:46.99]You spend all the time, all the money, all the resources to get the factories, get the permits.
[13:54.46]And the first thing you want to do, the factory's ready to go.
[13:58.10]You got the chocolate.
[13:58.96]You've got the recipes.
[13:59.88]It was passed out by your fucking grandmother.
[14:03.78]Spray Windex and all that.
[14:06.60]What the fuck, dude?
[14:07.60]No.
[14:07.84]What are you doing?
[14:08.36]What's wrong with you?
[14:09.14]What the fuck, dude?
[14:10.98]Fuck you.
[14:11.50]Alright.
[14:14.55]Well, that's the end of that day.
[14:20.52]Like, oh, we got our chocolate spinning in that big vat that you see on every single one of those How It's Made videos.
[14:25.67]With the churning.
[14:27.69]It's a big bowl that's sideways that's spinning.
[14:31.05]And some guy comes over with a ladle.
[14:33.01]And he drops, like, flavorings in it.
[14:34.42]It spins around.
[14:37.02]And then the CEO comes over with Windex.
[14:39.76]And goes... Fuck you.
[14:46.85]Get out of here.
[14:47.93]I'm doing shit here.
[14:54.08]He just opened the factory.
[14:56.42]Get the fuck out of here.
[14:58.48]Go home.
[15:00.04]He throws cigarettes in.
[15:01.82]He just has a lit cigarette.
[15:04.06]That chocolate looks really good.
[15:07.38]Flick!
[15:10.51]Imagine being the chocolatier and being like, you fucking asshole.
[15:13.79]Now we gotta shut the whole thing down.
[15:18.61]God.
[15:20.19]Well, I'm not that guy.
[15:22.04]He's actually mad.
[15:23.10]I am mad at this guy.
[15:24.22]That was stupid what he did.
[15:25.98]He shouldn't have done that.
[15:27.34]He sprayed Windex into my chocolate spinning undulator, and it's making me very mad.
[15:32.96]This person doesn't exist, but I hate them.
[15:35.04]I hate this person.
[15:38.59]Oh, we're out of coffee.
[15:39.19]Okay.
[15:42.87]You're mad at a made-up person.
[15:44.81]So what?
[15:50.37]Could be real.
[15:51.63]Okay.
[15:52.31]Now, okay, we need to change this.
[15:53.57]We need more of the special reserve chocolate.
[15:56.26]I love this game.
[15:57.08]This game is so cool.
[15:57.94]Alright.
[16:00.78]I need to do change recipe.
[16:02.16]I need raspberry.
[16:04.94]Ooh, look at that.
[16:06.72]How many cases do I need?
[16:10.83]Just two, right?
[16:12.07]But we could probably sell this for pretty good.
[16:13.53]Alright.
[16:16.33]Let's go for it.
[16:21.27]beef in the chocolate I mean I don't know how the in-depth game gets later but I know for a fact that uh we have at least four of the pages that we have not made chocolates on that's a full stack that's a full stack I'm really happy about that one really happy that turned out
[16:43.92]I wish, I wish, are there more games like this?
[16:47.60]I don't care about any other video game.
[16:49.72]You guys wanted me to watch the fucking PlayStation Direct?
[16:52.10]I care about this.
[16:53.00]I want, I want to play this.
[16:58.01]Like, PlayStation could have come up with a press release that said if you watched the Direct, you got $50 deposited into your bank account, and I would be like, I'd rather play the chocolate game.
[17:04.51]I don't care.
[17:06.11]I'd be like, no, I don't care.
[17:12.89]I'm busy.
[17:13.97]I'm very busy.
[17:18.47]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[17:25.21]Rich streamers.
[17:36.51]No, am I the weird CEO?
[17:41.07]No, I don't want to be the weird CEO guy that, like, just, I'm playing my chocolate game.
[17:45.71]Leave me alone.
[17:54.20]You're a millennial CEO.
[17:56.86]I've got, I've got like a fucking Star Wars t-shirt on.
[18:02.10]I'm wearing slippers and like jogging pants.
[18:06.62]And I like skipped out on the company meeting because I'm playing an old nostalgic chocolate making game.
[18:11.98]Oh no.
[18:18.48]Guys, this shit like kind of happened.
[18:24.76]I've got like important stuff going on.
[18:26.80]I've got a huge fucking stream coming up.
[18:29.14]And I skipped out on a fucking meeting.
[18:31.68]It didn't happen today, but it may have happened like yesterday.
[18:40.98]It's real.
[18:44.20]No, no, no, no, don't worry.
[18:46.06]It's okay.
[18:46.86]I'll bring myself down a few pegs when I do the Catboy stream, right?
[18:59.01]Down a few pegs.
[18:59.99]It's a term.
[19:01.15]It's cleaning your clock.
[19:02.38]It's down a few pegs.
[19:03.34]It's getting knocked down a few.
[19:06.02]You have no idea what my plan is for that stream.
[19:08.36]I'm going to tell you one of the plans, and I can't do it.
[19:11.66]Hold on.
[19:13.17]I have to ask if I can do it.
[19:14.17]No.
[19:14.29]You know what?
[19:14.69]I was going to tell you one of the things I was going to do.
[19:15.99]You don't think I'm going to be knocked down a few pegs?
[19:18.31]I wanted to have... Should I tell you?
[19:21.09]Should I tell you?
[19:21.79]Should I keep it a secret for that Catboy stream?
[19:23.76]That's something that will knock me down a few pegs.
[19:26.67]Hmm?
[19:27.55]Maybe I'll tell you.
[19:28.65]No.
[19:29.02]No, I can't tell you.
[19:29.58]Because if I can do it, it's worth it.
[19:32.78]Secret.
[19:33.04]Alright.
[19:33.24]It's a secret.
[19:33.74]Fine.
[19:33.98]Fine.
[19:34.26]Fine.
[19:34.92]Alright.
[19:40.22]How about this?
[19:40.62]If I can't do it, I'll tell you.
[19:44.35]If I cannot do the thing I want to do on the Catboy stream, after the Catboy stream, I will tell you what it was.
[19:52.17]And then you can decide if it was a bad or a good idea or not.

[20:32.61]Remember, it's two Catboy streams.
[20:35.68]Yeah.
[20:36.32]Well... The first Catboy stream is gonna be... A little wild.
[20:42.58]The second Catboy stream... I don't know.

[20:52.15]I'm just kidding.
[20:52.65]It'll happen in like a few months.
[20:54.31]I'm just kidding.
[20:54.77]It'll happen in probably like three months.
[20:56.07]Four months.
[20:57.44]Alright, let's go.
[20:58.96]I need to travel to... Where was this going?
[21:05.88]Okay.
[21:07.76]Angiers.
[21:12.12]It's not tomorrow, no.
[21:13.07]Alright, here we go.
[21:18.15]Hasty.
[21:18.93]So that was the two raspberry.
[21:22.21]Oh, so we got this guy as a contact now.
[21:24.39]And then 34 cases of the reserve.
[21:25.65]There it is.
[21:26.81]I trust Felix had something to do with this.
[21:28.35]In which case, it's my pleasure to give you a new coffee recipe.
[21:31.47]Special blend.
[21:33.35]And of course, you can find the Moroccan coffee for this recipe at the market here in Tangiers.
[21:37.77]Stop by in a month or so.
[21:39.05]I hear all kinds of things down at the port.
[21:41.79]Ooh.
[21:44.27]Special blend.
[21:48.76]I have a lot of this.
[21:50.40]Should I make some special blend coffee now?
[21:53.06]No, what was that?
[21:53.52]That was a weird voice.
[21:55.44]I had a fucking dream about SpongeBob.
[21:56.64]What was it?
[21:58.92]Oh my god, what was the dream about SpongeBob?
[22:00.96]I had one of those stupid inconsequential dreams.
[22:04.68]Remember we talked about how Super Mario was on PlayStation 5?
[22:07.38]And that's like a dumb dream that like who cares and you wake up and you don't even give a shit anymore and you forget it in an hour?
[22:11.92]I had a SpongeBob on TV did something dream that was so dumb and inconsequential it meant nothing.
[22:17.70]But what was it?
[22:22.26]Oh my god, what was it?
[22:24.36]It was so inconsequential.
[22:25.91]It was stupid.
[22:27.69]I think the re- Okay.
[22:31.57]I think the reason why I said the imagine if Mario was on PlayStation thing was because I think the only thing that was weird about the dream was SpongeBob was on TBS or something.
[22:44.59]That was it.
[22:44.93]I was like, oh, why SpongeBob's on TBS?
[22:47.50]He's not on this network.
[22:48.70]I think that's why I said that today.
[22:53.63]Is that really what happened?
[22:54.91]Am I just retroactively adding that memory in?
[22:56.99]I don't know.
[22:58.31]I think that's what happened, though.
[22:59.29]Okay, let's... Alright, I need to sell.
[23:06.46]Fine.
[23:07.20]I trusted you with the recipe, silly zonka wonka.
[23:10.46]I also trust that the next time you darken my doorway, you'll have 40 cases of Arabian Bold we agreed upon.
[23:15.78]Uh-oh.
[23:24.95]That's not a bad price considering I flooded the market with this stuff.
[23:34.03]Oh, no, no, no.
[23:34.69]I'm not going to sell it here.
[23:36.27]Let me just play the game.
[23:37.11]This is playing the game.
[23:37.89]It's fucking talking and making deals.
[23:41.37]What are we talking about?
[23:42.37]Play the game.
[23:42.85]I'm talking and making deals with people.
[23:53.84]Jesus, that's so expensive.
[23:55.18]Alright, I'm going to go... I'm going to go sell this.
[24:00.59]Do you have peppers?
[24:03.57]No.
[24:03.97]Okay, I need to get peppers.
[24:07.39]Let's see if we can sell this Cuban clock cleaner for like 150 grand.
[24:14.35]I can... Alright, I can get it, but this is cheap.
[24:15.96]Fuck.
[24:20.74]I had an opportunity to get rid of all this.
[24:25.34]That's not a bad price for this, though.
[24:27.18]Yeah, I'll sell it.
[24:31.09]Not a bad price for the raspberry, either.
[24:32.33]I'm gonna sell it.
[24:38.33]I want someone to... Previously seen for $15 to $45.
[24:42.51]I could have sold it for $22.38 in Tangiers.
[24:45.22]Fuck.
[24:49.76]Did I hear that you might be able to move a bit on your offer?
[24:52.50]Oh, but that's still not enough.
[24:56.38]Is that the best price I'm going to get for this until I have to change coffees?
[25:00.66]Is this the Among Us guy?
[25:07.41]No.
[25:10.29]People keep confusing me for that person.
[25:17.45]People confuse me for that person all the time.
[25:21.03]I don't know who that person is.
[25:26.13]You're a liar.
[25:29.19]They used jermaSus at the Sony conference.
[25:31.61]What the fuck are you talking about?
[25:32.91]No, they didn't.

[27:23.37]That is sense danger.
[27:25.53]It is from sorcery.
[27:27.24]I've had that command since like 2015.
[27:28.46]That's a command from, it's a spell in the game sorcery.
[27:35.10]Way before all this among us shit.
[27:37.58]I said shit with like an angry mean voice, but I meant to say like among us shit.
[27:42.44]Like all this among us stuff.
[27:45.26]I had that for like five years, and I ain't changing it.
[27:47.36]Alright, well, I'm on a black screen right now.
[27:54.32]Alright, thanks for the link.
[27:57.50]The PlayStation Direct.
[27:59.62]Let's go back to playing the video game, please.
[28:01.36]What's going on with you guys today?
[28:07.15]Hmm.
[28:08.87]Full moon.
[28:09.97]Is there a full moon?
[28:10.55]Check.
[28:10.77]Everybody check and see if there's a full moon tonight.
[28:19.15]Is it?
[28:19.75]I bet it is.
[28:22.87]I bet it is.
[28:23.35]Okay, so I can... I don't know if I want to sell this for $18.87.
[28:30.77]I can get a better price somewhere else.
[28:32.93]Although I should buy some more peppers.
[28:36.62]Is this price final here?
[28:39.10]Is there a little bit of wiggle room here?
[28:40.68]Thank you.
[28:41.68]Boy, that really is a little bit.
[28:42.86]That was like a dollar off.
[28:47.08]That was three dollars off
[28:50.50]The full moon tomorrow.
[28:51.48]Yeah, I know.
[28:52.46]Trust me, I know.
[28:57.52]Well, whatever.
[28:58.82]I need enough to get rid of the honey.
[29:02.31]I'm going big.
[29:06.23]I'm going to sell a shitload of these.
[29:07.37]Alright, you might think that was a bad idea, but I needed the peppers.
[29:13.21]Almonds are pretty cheap here.
[29:17.71]Ooh, that's cheap.
[29:20.45]Prince, these are really cheap.
[29:23.61]Yeah, I'm going to get a bunch of these too.
[29:26.54]Let's get 100 of these.
[29:27.18]I got tons of sugar already.
[29:35.72]Alright, that should continue to produce.
[29:37.28]By the way, if you don't know why I did that, if this is me that weren't here yesterday.
[29:41.34]Every time I travel or make a new batch of chocolate, a week goes by.
[29:46.20]So this is not producing chocolate right now.
[29:48.26]It only starts to produce when I cycle through time.
[29:51.80]We have not done that yet.
[29:53.22]Every time I do a task, no one cares?
[29:58.18]Oh, okay.
[29:59.82]No one cares, says Jerma Zerked on stream.
[30:11.35]Sherpa zerked on stream says hey nobody cares Do we modem for an hour No, I can't see that alright back like oh
[30:29.61]Back, like, years ago.
[30:31.41]Like, oh, mod that guy.
[30:32.55]Oh, yeah, I modded that guy for, like, 45 minutes or something.
[30:36.75]There are whole systems in place now across, like, the Discord and the channel where modding somebody for, like, 30 minutes might pose complete disaster to detonate the entire community.
[30:47.94]Like, they could cause mayhem if they really wanted to.
[30:50.44]So, like, I can't do that anymore.
[30:56.40]It's a funny thought, though, isn't it?
[31:00.30]True, so do it.
[31:01.52]No, VIP them.
[31:05.18]There are whole systems in place now.
[31:06.72]Alright, play the fucking game.
[31:09.06]13% of people that watch the stream on the census want you to play the video game.
[31:12.52]I have to make them happy!
[31:13.50]Holy shit, I gotta take a picture of this.
[31:18.48]What the fuck is going on?
[31:20.10]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[31:21.28]This battery just is standing on end.
[31:23.06]This is like a magic thing.
[31:24.28]I have no idea what's going on.
[31:24.96]I don't know how this is happening.
[31:25.76]How this is happening.
[31:27.54]I gotta get a picture of this.
[31:30.24]Oh my fucking god, what is doing this?
[31:33.80]It's floating.
[31:34.38]I have a floating battery in front of me.
[31:37.58]Why?
[31:46.17]Why?
[31:49.25]Holy shit, why is that happening?
[31:52.17]Okay, okay, I have to... Let me get... I have to... I'm gonna put this on the Discord.
[31:58.95]Or... I just... I'm gonna put it on here.
[32:03.09]the cam on no no no I can't I'm naked why did this happen you guys have to see this I gotta get this I'll tweet I'm gonna tweet this out here comes a tweet
[32:34.00]I don't understand why this happened.
[32:41.00]You tell me what's going on here.
[32:50.20]This is probably so easily explainable, but I can't explain it.
[32:53.19]So I'm going to delete this tweet in like an hour.
[33:04.48]Okay, here it goes.
[33:10.68]Tell me what's going on here.
[33:18.84]Did it go through?
[33:23.66]Why did that happen?
[33:28.48]Why is this floating?
[33:36.90]It's a magnet.
[33:39.00]This is not a magnet.
[33:40.78]That's the base of my monitors.
[33:41.94]That's a monitor stand.
[33:44.04]It's dusty.
[33:45.32]Come on.
[33:47.18]But what do you mean magnet?
[33:48.14]This is the bottom of my monitor stand.
[33:52.32]There's not a magnet right here.
[33:59.65]Static electricity.
[34:00.39]Why is the battery stuck?
[34:01.35]I don't know.
[34:01.67]It's stuck hard.
[34:02.81]There's a magnet in the battery.
[34:07.89]You can't see the magnets in the monitor.
[34:09.25]What?
[34:10.83]Your monitor has magnetic properties.
[34:12.25]I'm going to put it on stream.
[34:14.51]Do you guys see it?
[34:17.51]It's all magnets.
[34:18.13]This literally has to be a magnet in there.
[34:19.45]Why would there be a magnet on the bottom of my monitor?
[34:26.03]What the fuck would the point be having a monitor stand with a magnet in the bottom?
[34:29.73]Why would you tweet this?
[34:30.47]I don't know.
[34:31.19]I'm deleting it.
[34:44.03]Batteries are magnetic.
[34:44.95]Yeah, but I have like a plastic stand.
[34:53.60]I think that's magic.
[35:05.65]Okay, that's the image you send, like, to your mom, being like, Mom, what the heck is going on?
[35:10.89]And she's like, oh, honey, that's really, really interesting.
[35:14.13]No, there are magnets.
[35:15.73]A battery is magnetized, and it's sticking to the metal base of your monitor.
[35:20.75]Really neat, though.
[35:21.73]Really, really cool that it happened that way.
[35:23.57]I didn't put it there.
[35:26.32]I'm telling you, I just, like, I took a sip of my coffee, and I heard, and I looked over, and this fucking Duracell just sticking out of my monitor.
[35:36.55]was weird it's neat okay neat things alright clean your desk it's dusty I live in Las Vegas it's dry and dusty here dust it no I I did I do and no no that that's
[36:00.04]Oh, no, no, I see what you guys are seeing.
[36:02.10]Uh, that's just, like, a weird finish on the bottom of my, uh, monitor.
[36:10.15]I see what you guys are seeing.
[36:10.91]That, like, the dust on the thing is not actually dust.
[36:13.33]It's, like, a... It's, like, just speckled for some reason.
[36:16.12]Yeah, I want to see what a fucking desk looked like, okay?
[36:23.24]Right now, at least 5,000 of you just crumpled up the fucking, like, McDonald's french fry container you have on there.
[36:32.01]Just sitting there with, like, three just dead gross fries at the bottom that you didn't eat.
[36:37.09]And you're just like, I threw that away.
[36:38.53]That's not on my desk.
[36:43.09]Sure.
[36:43.67]But I have a little bit of dust on my desk.
[36:45.57]I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[36:47.79]I'm sorry.
[36:48.59]Okay, let's go.
[36:51.47]You're projecting.
[36:52.49]No, it's called I am leveling with you.
[36:58.49]We're not American.
[37:01.73]Only Americans eat McDonald's?
[37:04.85]This person is lost, by the way.
[37:08.07]They just keep driving around in a circle.
[37:09.73]I feel like I almost want to stop this person.
[37:15.48]How much cocaine do you do?
[37:16.84]Zero.
[37:17.94]I have no drugs in my system and I never have.
[37:22.49]I am naturally fucking out of my mind, okay?
[37:26.03]It's natural.
[37:32.72]What about red wine?
[37:33.52]No.
[37:33.98]I just, today, I don't know.
[37:34.70]I'm just like, I don't, I'm like, I'm uppity today.
[37:37.08]You know, I'm very up, up here.
[37:38.38]I don't know why.
[37:40.28]What's going on?
[37:40.72]What happened today?
[37:43.23]Cheap.
[37:45.17]You're kidding.
[37:45.55]These are laughable.
[37:53.10]Uh, this coffee sells really well.
[37:54.76]Let's get 200.
[37:59.50]You're absolutely on something illegal.
[38:07.55]I wonder how can, you know, it's really funny.
[38:10.07]I've had conversations with people in the past and like, okay, let's be, let's just truly just take a second here and just talk about this.
[38:16.08]I've had people in the past actually tell me
[38:19.09]Yeah, dude, like, I thought, like, maybe at some point, maybe you were on drugs at some point.
[38:24.35]No.
[38:25.35]I'm just like, really?
[38:25.97]You actually fucking thought that?
[38:27.73]Like, yeah, I, like, figured maybe you could have been.
[38:30.32]I'm like, no, I'm not at all.
[38:32.50]Like, get out of here.
[38:35.94]I've had that asked before.
[38:38.60]Like, dude, like, be honest, though.
[38:40.18]Like, you've dabbled a little while on stream.
[38:43.39]No, absolutely not.
[38:44.49]At zero.
[38:45.09]Never in my life.
[38:45.87]In my whole life.
[38:49.39]Like, that's okay.
[38:51.47]And it's almost, like, more bizarre to them that that's the case.
[38:55.85]Like, wait.
[38:56.53]Alright, man.
[38:58.75]No, but you have, though, right?
[38:59.67]Like, you can tell me.
[39:00.74]We're, like, close.
[39:02.10]No.
[39:09.28]He's just fucked up.
[39:10.30]I'm not even fucked up.
[39:11.26]I'm just, like, uppity today.
[39:17.73]ADHD?
[39:17.87]Yeah, that's what it is.
[39:20.20]Yeah, of course.
[39:21.22]Company equals high.
[39:26.30]Alright, let's play the game.
[39:27.84]That's a bad excuse.
[39:33.73]I'm not even making an excuse.
[39:34.97]I'm just having fun, man.
[39:36.93]Okay, so I have enough coffee.
[39:39.85]Let's go to Australia because I... No, there's no...
[39:45.24]I have a feeling that I can go to Kona and sell this incredible coffee.
[39:50.86]It's a big trip.
[39:51.47]I'm willing to take it.
[39:52.09]Let's go.
[39:56.45]I have ADHD.
[39:56.95]I'm not a weirdo.
[40:01.94]Why do you have to be a weirdo if you have ADHD?
[40:04.12]What are you talking about?
[40:12.36]Oh.
[40:13.60]Silly Zonkawonka, I have heard from Alexandra.
[40:16.20]She needs to speak with you right away.
[40:17.64]She will wait for you at the Hotel de Cuba.
[40:19.68]Please go see her.
[40:20.33]Alright, cool.
[40:20.69]Fuck.
[40:29.69]Ah, somebody... I have 110 cases.
[40:31.53]I'll take two grand for this.
[40:35.28]So expensive.
[40:35.98]I'm almost out of raspberries.
[40:37.42]Do you have raspberries?
[40:45.19]Damn it.
[40:45.67]What a waste of a trip.
[40:53.45]I hate that.
[40:54.95]I hate it.
[40:55.89]I should have solved it.
[41:03.54]I need a... Okay, let's do Arabian Bold.
[41:07.72]I have this cone of coffee.
[41:09.84]Moroccan coffee.
[41:10.60]Okay, I've used almost all my Cuban coffee.
[41:15.34]Who would buy?
[41:16.36]Maybe if I go to Cuba, will they like that?
[41:18.69]I'm just going to go to Cuba.
[41:20.39]Cuban coffee in Cuba.
[41:21.41]Have you not been to Cuba?
[41:22.37]Have you not met Gina Famosa?
[41:24.43]Have you not made me my cafe con leche?
[41:30.56]This is the person that we owe like 40 cases of coffee to.
[41:33.08]What happened to all your limes?
[41:38.48]I still have 880.
[41:38.88]Alright, come on.

[51:18.51]It'll cost $250,000.
[51:19.01]You want to purchase the machinery.
[51:30.90]That's a lot of money.
[51:38.12]Maybe over the... Coffee is... No.
[51:41.08]Not worth it.

[55:01.58]And I need to go hand this in to Tangier.
[55:06.12]Alright, let's go.
[55:11.52]You're ignoring chat.
[55:12.42]Yeah, because like all it is is just people saying like Obama raid.
[55:16.10]What do you want me to pull out from here?
[55:20.38]You want me to just stare at the chat while I just see Obama raid, Obama raid.
[55:23.80]Look, it's Obama.
[55:24.74]Obama's here.
[55:25.62]Obama raid.
[55:26.76]What am I pulling from the chat that I'm not seeing?
[55:29.89]That I didn't see eight minutes ago?
[55:35.61]Ooh, hold on.
[55:41.61]Good to see you back in Tangier, silly zonkawonka.
[55:44.31]Listen, there will be some mighty fine cinnamon available here soon.
[55:47.99]Now that's an ingredient used in loads of delicious coffee recipes.
[55:51.11]In fact, I've got one such recipe for you here.
[55:54.11]If I give it to you now, will you be willing to do something for me?
[55:57.43]Yep.
[55:59.79]Cinnamon.
[56:01.97]Cinnamon coffee.
[56:02.73]People go nuts over this shit.
[56:08.15]Just gonna make a regular coffee.
[56:10.21]With regular, like, just Folgers coffee beans.
[56:13.01]And then just... Tap two things of cinnamon on top of it.
[56:17.54]And sell it for nine bucks.
[56:20.32]Oh!
[56:22.36]Mmm!
[56:23.08]Mmm!
[56:23.30]Wow!
[56:23.70]Cinnamon coffee!
[56:24.68]Yep, that'll be nine dollars.
[56:29.99]Sixty cases?! !
[56:39.02]No, they're not smelling.
[56:39.98]No, it's not sniffing it.
[56:42.30]They're not going.
[56:42.86]I mean, they could be.
[56:44.92]I'm sure that some people that buy coffee do that.
[56:50.14]Swell, bring 60 cases of chocolate with caramel here in town.
[56:56.15]Oh, okay.
[56:56.69]So I have to make 60 cases of caramel chocolate to get to unlock cinnamon.
[57:02.53]Okay.
[57:03.43]That's a lot.
[57:07.88]It is here.
[57:08.20]I delivered my 40.
[57:08.94]Ooh.
[57:09.22]Okay.
[57:18.21]Another recipe.
[57:20.91]Coffee mint.
[57:23.87]Coffee with mint.
[57:25.51]Colombian coffee, Moroccan coffee, and mint.
[57:27.31]I don't have any mint, so whatever.
[57:29.15]I think we should explore entering into a partnership for this shop.
[57:34.09]There would be many benefits for you.
[57:35.57]For starters, I'd always offer you the highest prices for your wares.
[57:39.37]More importantly, I'd be able to start taking special orders on your behalf.
[57:44.29]Really.
[57:46.07]Special orders work like this.
[57:47.29]I'll accept orders on your behalf, and then send you a telegram with the details of each order as I receive them.
[57:52.98]You can decide whether or not to accept each order, but I assure you special orders command the highest profit margins you will ever see.
[58:00.58]I will incur some startup costs to get the special order system up and running.
[58:05.06]If you're willing to share these costs by bringing me some products, we'll be square, and I'll be ready to enter into the partnership we discussed.
[58:12.02]Deal?
[58:12.32]Deal.
[58:20.18]Splendid!
[58:21.92]While I don't carry chocolates in my shop, I love them all the same.
[58:25.50]First, bring me 100 cases of special reserve 66% African cocoa.
[58:32.03]Holy shit, this goes for a lot.
[58:36.91]Oh, wait, we're in a partnership, aren't we?
[58:38.45]Oh, not yet.
[58:49.05]I need, um... I need Moroccan coffee.
[58:52.47]Yes, it's true, I'm expecting a new spice soon, and I'd be happy to offer you it for sale as soon as you show up with 60 cases of chocolate with caramel.
[59:01.58]I need, um... I need more coffee.
[59:09.65]I need more Moroccan coffee.
[59:15.85]Okay.
[59:18.63]That's a lot.
[59:27.23]Yes!
[59:29.88]Good deal.
[59:32.39]So I need a lot of Moroccan coffee.
[59:35.19]Let's do 200.
[59:35.91]Okay.
[59:38.47]Yeah.
[59:38.75]Yep.
[59:39.33]That's fine.
[59:39.74]I'll make it back.
[59:40.20]Can we get a battery cam?
[59:47.58]No.
[59:48.94]No, you can't.
[59:50.47]No, there will be no battery cam.
[59:58.46]Alright, this is going to keep producing.
[60:00.50]I'm going to go... I need... I'm going to go make a reserve.
[60:06.19]Recipe.
[60:06.55]Hold on.
[60:09.47]This is... Dualan Cocoa.
[60:13.02]And sugar.
[60:14.50]I have a ton... I was prepared.
[60:16.06]Remember I bought this at a discount and everyone said, Jerma, don't buy that.
[60:18.36]What are you buying that for?
[60:19.22]I bought it at a discount.
[60:20.24]I haggled with the guy.
[60:21.48]Now I have a shitload of it.
[60:22.58]I need a hundred of these.
[60:23.26]Let's go back to Zerk.
[60:37.51]Good price.
[60:37.89]That's a good price.
[60:40.63]That's a good price too.
[60:50.70]72 cases of this shit.
[60:52.38]Nice.
[60:54.44]I'm holding on to this.
[60:55.22]This is going to be, I'm going to make so much money on this.
[60:57.66]This would be, this would be like 50 times what I put in.
[61:01.04]Alright.
[61:02.92]I need to make the, this one here.
[61:07.54]26 cases per week.
[61:08.38]I don't need to do the thing.
[61:10.06]That's good enough.
[61:12.60]We want to see the battery.
[61:14.12]No.
[61:15.32]You don't need to see the battery.
[61:19.94]Should I?
[61:20.30]Do I have space to do?
[61:23.57]No, I don't have any room.
[61:27.17]Why can't I delete these?
[61:28.33]These are such junk.
[61:29.33]I want to delete them.
[61:36.56]Maybe I should just keep making this.
[61:41.32]Open up a new factory.
[61:45.91]Um, what do I got for quests right now?
[61:47.69]A new spice.
[61:48.31]Okay.
[61:51.19]I need 60 cases of the chocolate with caramel.
[61:54.65]I'm doing this first.
[61:56.79]Because I'm bringing 100 cases to this guy.
[61:59.44]So then I get a partnership with this guy.
[62:01.92]And then I can sell this Arabian Bold for the maximum profit to this guy.
[62:10.13]Oh shit, I forgot.
[62:12.96]I need 24 cases of cafe con leche shit.
[62:17.36]I keep blowing that lady off.
[62:19.06]Okay, how much?
[62:19.78]What does it take?
[62:24.92]Cuban.
[62:25.30]I need more Cuban coffee.
[62:26.62]It's Cuban coffee.
[62:30.61]Milk and sugar.
[62:32.49]Alright, let's go to Cuba.
[62:40.53]I don't have it yet.
[62:41.73]Oh.
[62:43.97]Wait.
[62:47.95]Silly Zonka Wonka.
[62:49.47]I understand whipped cream has recently become available.
[62:52.00]I have a recipe here that uses that very ingredient.
[62:54.64]Coffee with whipped cream.
[62:56.42]What a recipe.
[62:59.58]Wow.
[63:01.14]Coffee with whipped cream on top?
[63:04.48]What's the secret?
[63:05.86]What are you holding back from us?
[63:07.92]Holy smokes.
[63:11.15]What do I need to get the secret from you?
[63:14.62]If you'd be willing to take 28 cases to Nino Bragger in Zurich, he will pay you well for the goods.
[63:20.84]Sure.
[63:22.32]Oh, boy.
[63:23.24]The secret recipe.
[63:27.15]It's brew a coffee and then hold the can upside down and go.
[63:34.31]Only your great, great, great grandmother knew that.
[63:46.71]So expensive.
[63:49.79]Although this is actually on the low end.
[63:52.91]Last seen in... Okay, the last time I was here, this is $515 a stack.
[64:00.44]Do I dare try to come down?
[64:02.12]I mean, this is on the low end.
[64:06.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[64:07.32]It's already so good.
[64:14.25]Here we go.
[64:22.35]Alright, it's $100,000.
[64:22.75]$100,000.
[64:22.77]There's $520,000 in here.
[64:23.15]There's $100,000 on the line.
[64:23.91]There's three whammies here.
[64:25.07]Don't click a whammy.
[64:25.61]Alright.
[64:25.89]Okay, we're almost... Alright, alright, alright.
[64:28.25]I'm up.
[64:28.53]One more.
[64:28.83]I'm done.
[64:29.01]Oh, fuck yeah.
[64:56.65]Oh, hell yeah.
[64:57.25]That felt good.
[64:58.93]That felt good.
[64:59.49]I haven't really used any allspice.
[65:06.64]Let us choose.
[65:07.40]That's going to be really hard to do.
[65:10.58]I really want to do that, but like alt tabbing and turning on the extension and getting it to be in the right spot might be hard.
[65:19.37]We'll see.
[65:20.01]Maybe I'll do it later.
[65:23.02]Thank you, James, for the 10 community.
[65:24.48]Oh, sorry.

[66:03.75]And just put it on top of your coffee.
[66:05.65]You don't need me to do this for you.
[66:07.91]I don't have to do this part for you.
[66:10.37]Alright, so we're looking for 100.

[66:59.98]Somebody came in here and, like, killed me and muted the microphone right by... Ow.

[80:07.77]lemons can rot can lemons go bad in real life yeah they can eat a rotten lime on stream why do I have this weird thing in my brain that lemons have this self sustainable internal like it they like bacteria like a lemon juice is so sour and so acidic that like it cannot go bad because it kills all the bacteria and germs in the middle
[80:36.26]Why do I have this weird thing that as long as the skin's on, they have like a whole ecosystem where they can be like clean in there?
[80:43.36]I know that's not true, but why do I think it could be?
[80:50.47]It's immortal lemons.
[80:54.03]Because you're dumb.
[80:54.73]No, it's just a little thought project.
[80:57.51]I know that lemons go bad.
[80:58.91]I'm just saying, like, why is it in my mind a lemon is like this ecosystem that is immutable?
[81:06.04]You know, kind of like blockchain technology.
[81:08.49]You've heard of that yet?
[81:23.54]Because you're two feet tall?
[81:24.64]Paying that person for at least an hour.

[83:56.97]Nope.
[83:57.27]Not right now.
[84:05.86]Holy shit.
[84:09.28]Holy shit.
[84:10.06]Holy shit.
[84:10.78]Holy shit.
[84:11.44]That's $400,000.
[84:11.66]Oh my God.
[84:12.82]That's 400 grand.
[84:13.66]Holy shit.
[84:14.08]I almost got a million dollars.
[84:16.64]Oh, wow.
[84:19.57]Oh, wow.
[84:20.15]Okay, don't- I'm never gambling ever again in the game.
[84:22.57]Because that's like half a million dollars almost.
[84:26.37]That's a lot of coffee.
[84:31.27]Why is tea so expensive?
[84:34.54]Listen, friend.
[84:35.78]I just harvested a- Ow!
[84:44.44]I just walked into the store and bumped my elbow on the-
[84:48.26]Like the side opening the door to the shop.
[84:51.30]It's the dagger.
[84:55.41]That's the reaction.
[84:57.19]Instead of being like... No, no, no.
[85:01.55]It's... Ow!
[85:03.55]And then I'm dead?
[85:10.09]Listen, friend.
[85:10.73]I just harvested a bumper crop of coffee beans here.
[85:15.56]There's not a whole lot I can do on the price, but I'd be willing to trade 5,000 sacks of Cuban coffee for 75 cases of special blend.
[85:28.20]Are you kidding me?
[85:32.19]That's 5,000.
[85:33.47]Okay, hold on.
[85:34.17]It's like 300 to 400 bucks a sack.
[85:38.53]I need to do some calculation here.
[85:40.45]It's like $340 a sack.
[85:46.35]So 340 times 5,000, that's $1.7 million of product.
[85:54.05]For just 75 cases of Special Blend.
[85:56.44]How much does it cost to make Special Blend?
[86:01.42]Isn't Special Blend just all three of them?
[86:03.54]Holy shit, that's incredible.
[86:10.38]Oh my god, why would you be giving this to me?
[86:13.40]That's 400 times...
[86:16.95]This is $2 million in inventory.
[86:22.15]Why would I buy this?
[86:23.00]No.
[86:24.66]Excuse me.
[86:25.08]No, I'm not going to buy any of that from you.
[86:26.46]Hey, man, please talk about the Duncaccino.
[86:32.58]Al Duncaccino, the king of the coffee.
[86:35.16]Oh, wait.
[86:35.60]Are you referring to?
[86:36.63]This is going to get a ton of minus twos.
[86:40.01]And a bunch of people are going to be cringing over this.
[86:41.63]I know.
[86:45.67]I don't care.
[86:49.05]That's the only part of the movie that I even watched.
[87:00.78]Alright.
[87:01.82]75k is a special blend.
[87:03.18]I came here to get coffee and I have... I'll come back later for it.
[87:06.58]How are we doing on inventory?
[87:14.73]Alright, I'm almost at the Sprite Sponge, which I probably should go.
[87:16.87]Alright, I'm going to go to Zurich and I change this to Tar to the Moon.
[87:20.39]Nope, not yet.
[87:21.03]How many does he want?
[87:22.31]10.
[87:22.53]Let's go to Zurich anyways.
[87:28.00]That was Bernie.
[87:33.70]I like to call a meeting.
[87:36.58]I would like five minutes of time.
[87:40.88]The senator from Vermont is being recognized for five minutes.
[87:44.68]I just have to say that the Dunkin' Chino from Dunkin' Donuts is the best coffee that I've ever had.
[87:55.39]Is that all from the Senator of Vermont?
[87:58.25]No, of course not.
[88:00.03]Fuck all you.
[88:01.43]Everybody here.
[88:03.01]You all fucked this whole thing up over the last like 25 years.
[88:06.97]You're all a bunch of fucking idiots.
[88:12.21]Okay, the Senator's time is up.
[88:22.42]How can you tell him, Barney?
[88:29.54]You're based Andy.
[88:31.12]Oh, what?
[88:32.58]That's political streamer?
[88:34.22]Is it?
[88:41.41]And by the way, he's waving around an extra large Dunkachino.
[88:46.17]The ones that aren't even on the menu.
[88:47.19]The ones you have to actually order special.

[106:17.01]That's so expensive.
[106:19.32]But you're a millionaire.
[106:21.88]Yes, okay.
[106:22.86]I am a millionaire.
[106:23.92]But if I buy 200 cases, I won't be a millionaire anymore.
[106:30.95]If I buy 200 cases, I'm not a millionaire anymore.
[106:40.62]Not true.
[106:41.62]Math.

[106:44.66]I'm buying 200 of each.
[106:47.67]There's two things to buy here, and they're both expensive.
[106:51.33]I have to be buying a bunch of these, too.
[106:53.85]Will I still be a millionaire?
[106:56.79]Oh, thank God.
[106:57.71]Thank God.
[106:58.73]Oh, thank God.

[107:24.14]And then bring the special blend.
[107:25.80]I have 75 cases.
[107:27.28]Let's go to Cuba.
[107:31.16]Anything else I can do here?
[107:31.90]Temple.
[107:34.81]Temple.
[107:38.30]Spend the rest of your money on lemons.
[107:42.08]Just buy a million dollars worth of lemons.
[107:48.78]Just corner the entire lemon market.
[107:51.46]It would be the stupidest thing you'd ever do.
[107:56.02]I need to change.
[107:57.30]Let's change this recipe first.
[108:01.60]What do I want to make?
[108:03.34]I could do the coffee and whipped cream.
[108:07.25]Yeah.
[108:09.71]Oh, hold on.
[108:12.74]Hello again.
[108:13.22]I see you have acquired the recipe for coffee with Amaretto.
[108:15.82]I've got over 100 sacks of Amaretto here you could use.
[108:18.60]Would you be willing to complete an order for some of those products?
[108:20.98]Yeah, sure.
[108:22.72]Here are 160 sacks of Amaretto.
[108:25.10]Rufus Loddington will be staying here in town at the Longshore Lodge for the next few months.
[108:29.53]If you can bring him 80 cases of coffee with Amaretto before he leaves, he'll pay for the products.
[108:36.17]Okay.
[108:37.93]I want to do this one.
[108:39.36]How much do I have to make?
[108:41.90]I need 28.
[108:42.50]I just need to make 28.
[108:52.26]Take the bag and run.
[108:55.91]I own the establishment.
[108:57.73]That would be very bizarre.
[108:58.75]If the CEO had product lined up.
[109:05.58]meeting one of his employees, and they said, hey, we have a bunch of, the truck just came in with 200 sacks of amaretto, and I grabbed them and ran away.
[109:13.94]It'd be like, okay, well, he's coming back because he owns this place.
[109:16.48]Like, you...
[109:35.24]It's like running away from your own house with it.
[109:37.44]Where are you going to go?
[109:38.08]You're on a plane?
[109:41.58]I need a hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.
[109:48.90]Alright, there we go.
[109:53.37]What did I need?
[109:54.15]28?
[109:54.89]Almost got it exactly.
[110:01.05]That order is done.
[110:06.22]28 at the bank in Zurich.
[110:09.41]Now we need 80 cases of coffee with Amaretto.
[110:18.67]I got a lot of inventory.
[110:19.49]I got to sell some stuff.
[110:21.55]I'm going to go visit my brother Dieter in Tokyo.
[110:24.93]He was not too wild about my coffee idea, but seeing the success you have with these products, I think he's come around.
[110:29.52]He's got a pretty nice factory over there.
[110:31.14]I believe he's also to manufacture infusions.
[110:34.68]Oh, yeah.
[110:39.37]Alright, who wanted what?
[110:40.69]Amaretto.
[110:44.57]Use that recipe.
[110:45.21]Let's go for it.
[110:45.75]Alright, let's make more.
[111:01.85]I need to make a bunch of these.
[111:03.01]I need 80 cases.
[111:23.50]Oh shit, come on, I gotta connect these.
[111:26.28]Come on.
[111:29.54]No!
[111:30.16]Oh my god, it sucks.
[111:35.55]I hate this thing.

[116:29.59]You've built like a camera tripod.
[116:36.92]whatever alright I need how many I need to make 80. alright complete all tasks before November with honey okay I gotta first of all let me go to Cuba let me go to Cuba and get my 5 000 sacks of cuban coffee
[117:06.06]There we are.
[117:07.56]I'll take the special blend and hand over the beans.
[117:09.44]I'm glad this worked out so well.
[117:11.40]I can't imagine you need any more Cuban coffee at this juncture, but it never hurts to review prices.
[117:16.28]You're right.
[117:16.68]Can I sell it back to you?
[117:24.01]5,000 Cuban coffee beans.
[117:32.57]That's a lot.
[117:35.63]Oh, that's a lot too.
[117:38.93]Alright, I need to go back to... Where's the guy?
[117:41.31]Where's my guy that takes all coffee?
[117:44.99]Just take these gross things from me.
[117:52.02]Wait, did I do the thing in... Yeah, I did.
[117:57.42]I need to keep the caramel.
[118:00.28]I have 60.
[118:02.02]All coffee now is going to get sold to the other guy.
[118:07.01]So now where is this?
[118:10.38]Okay, whipped cream.
[118:12.32]That's Zurich.
[118:17.12]And this is in Tangiers.
[118:21.48]Okay, Tangiers and then Zurich.
[118:23.02]Let's go.
[118:31.78]Okay, make sure that you're continually introducing new coffees.
[118:33.78]Here we go.
[118:34.62]These chocolate bars with caramel are simply scrumptious.
[118:37.36]Oh, they are scrumptious.
[118:38.60]Of course they are.
[118:39.90]I made them.
[118:41.32]In exchange, I'd like to present you with 200 sacks of a wonderful spice, cinnamon.
[118:47.81]You won't find finer cinnamon anywhere in the world.
[118:50.41]Be sure to come back if you need any more.
[118:51.69]Nice.
[118:52.47]Holy shit, that's good.
[118:53.35]200.
[118:54.47]That's $157,000 in inventory for free.
[118:55.27]I didn't do anything.
[119:07.74]Very nice.
[119:10.01]Welcome back to your shop, silly Zonkamonka.
[119:11.67]It is always a pleasure to see you again.
[119:12.89]Alright.
[119:15.21]Let me show you how to screw this up.
[119:19.93]80.
[119:20.35]So the coffee with amaretto off table.
[119:23.13]No, I can't sell it.
[119:24.43]Coffee with whipped cream and amaretto off the table.
[119:27.93]Everything else is fair game.
[119:30.65]Mocha.
[119:31.72]Fair game.
[119:35.22]That's a good price.
[119:37.86]Sell it.
[119:40.26]Special blend.
[119:41.78]Sell it.
[119:44.25]That's another big take.
[119:45.81]Alright.
[119:46.49]Whipped cream and amaretto.
[119:47.61]Leave them alone.
[119:52.85]Why do you type the number when there's a giant sell all button you can use for each item?
[119:56.41]It's a very good question.
[119:57.93]I'll tell you.
[119:58.83]The reason why I do that is so I can see the number, the actual number, the actual amount of money I will receive.
[120:04.23]Because if you hit sell all, it does not tell you the number.
[120:08.10]It's nice to kind of have a visual of how much money it's going to be worth.
[120:10.46]I like to kind of see it.
[120:15.94]I don't like corporate Jerma.
[120:17.80]Yeah, he went all corporate.
[120:22.77]Alright, we have the... We can go back to... We'll go to Zurich first.
[120:27.73]We'll start some new chocolate.
[120:35.05]Make a chocolate called When the Imposter is Sus.
[120:37.43]Am I... Moretto.
[120:52.73]Alright, this guy was the whipped cream.
[120:55.91]Coffee with whipped cream?
[120:57.15]Oh, what an incredible luxury.
[120:59.57]Here's $45,000 for 28 cases.
[121:02.97]Also, if you find your way to Tangier's one day, I understand there's a new spice.
[121:07.63]Nutmeg.
[121:10.65]What a dope.
[121:14.25]That's the guy running the bank?
[121:16.23]Is this in charge of our money?
[121:21.31]That should scare you.
[121:27.44]Nobody else has a... I almost said quiz.
[121:29.54]Nobody has a quiz for me here?
[121:35.86]Let's do this special order.

[123:14.38]Okay.

[124:13.62]Use them.
[124:13.86]Okay.
[124:23.72]Savannah.

[125:25.78]You want coffee with whipped cream?
[125:27.16]Don't I have some of that already?
[125:31.06]Is that what I'm currently making?

[142:50.13]I thought I had to come... There was a reason why I wanted to come here.
[142:52.81]For coffee, right?
[142:55.07]I wanted to come here for a reason.
[142:57.35]I think it was to buy coffee.
[142:59.11]It was.
[142:59.70]Okay.
[143:00.46]I'm not out of my mind.
[143:13.61]Previous $12 to $74.

[143:17.78]I'm going to buy a shitload of cream while it's low.
[143:22.62]Let's buy 500 cream.

[143:48.36]Go back to Hawaii and meet with her.
[143:53.28]What?
[143:59.46]Holy shit.
[144:00.38]It has a lot of money.
[144:01.42]Hold on.
[144:04.50]Yeah, I was supposed to go there.
[144:06.40]Alright, let's dump this.
[144:09.84]100 cases.
[144:13.82]That feels good.
[144:14.88]That feels really good to sell at that amount of money.
[144:20.70]$451,000.
[144:20.84]Just dumped.
[144:27.26]Moroccan coffee.
[144:28.10]We could use a little more.
[144:28.92]Okay.
[144:39.48]Nutmeg as well.
[144:41.46]It sells for a lot.
[144:43.06]I'm just going to let it produce.
[144:44.20]People are going to think I'm fucking crazy for this.
[144:46.78]People are going to be like, holy shit, dude, you are insane.
[144:50.28]Am I though?
[144:52.14]Because this is just going to produce for the next three or four weeks and I'm going to be able to sell it for like a million dollars.
[144:57.39]This will be my first one million dollar drop.
[145:00.85]A million dollar drop over here at the Moroccan coffee shop.
[145:04.13]Guaranteed.
[145:05.53]See you in like two weeks when I do that.
[145:09.08]This chocolate needs to change.
[145:10.06]This is horrible.
[145:13.36]I mean, come on.
[145:16.04]Change that over.
[145:19.42]What?
[145:21.06]I have no idea how, but Kawaki over at Uluru managed to get a hold of 7,500 sacks of cacao she's trying to offload.
[145:31.17]Bring her 100 cases of Irish coffee.
[145:33.09]No, get out of here.
[145:37.79]That's like... Wait.
[145:39.44]I already bought... Look.
[145:41.64]See, what you don't know... Sorry, lady.
[145:45.20]Back... Like, before this took off... Before... Like, before Coco took off... I got it at like five bucks.
[145:53.91]Eight bucks.
[145:54.81]I bought 2,000 of them.
[145:56.51]I don't need it.
[145:56.91]Your milk is rotting.
[145:59.49]It's fine.
[146:04.94]Alright, we gotta change this.
[146:07.18]Something that I actually have.
[146:08.22]Milk chocolate.
[146:14.29]Well, I bought a shitload of caramel, so maybe I'll just do that.
[146:19.41]My accidental caramel purchase might come in handy here.
[146:22.65]Okay, yeah.
[146:28.02]Use this one.
[146:28.90]I can do more than 18 a week.
[146:35.45]You're the kind of guy that eats monster cans.
[146:41.79]Eats the physical can of monster energy drink?
[146:44.91]Well, I'll tell you, I'm a guy that doesn't drink monster energy drink.
[146:47.22]I think you got me wrong.
[146:58.94]No, I just eat the cans, right?
[147:00.64]I'm not even looking at chat, and I know that's what you're writing.
[147:16.35]This lag is pissing me off.
[147:20.88]Makes it hard to do.
[147:21.52]This is kind of hard to do with the lag being like this.
[147:36.29]Yeah, this is like annoying to do with the lag.
[147:40.63]20 cases is better than I had before.
[147:41.87]Alright.
[147:50.00]Take a look at this.
[147:51.28]62 already.
[147:51.66]I haven't even done anything.
[147:53.74]Sell this tar to the moon.
[147:54.54]It's fucking useless.
[148:00.94]Okay.
[148:01.80]I am ready to go to Kona...
[148:05.15]And talk.
[148:06.07]Business.
[148:11.31]Silly Zonkabonka, I couldn't help but notice that you've got chocolate bars with caramel on hand.
[148:16.79]I happen to have a craving for those chocolates right now.
[148:20.49]If you'll give me 25 cases, I'll pay you $10,000.
[148:22.77]Extraordinary price for those chocolates.
[148:24.37]I'm sure you agree.
[148:25.07]What do you say?
[148:25.55]25 cases for $10,000?
[148:29.75]Take them.
[148:39.75]That's a lot for just chocolate with caramel.
[148:47.20]Did I get scammed?
[148:49.76]No, I didn't.
[148:50.16]25 cases of those just chocolate with caramel is probably like... It's probably not more than 10.
[148:58.77]Zach was most pleased with your delivery.
[149:00.41]And I thank you for that, silly Zonkabonka.
[149:02.39]Next, I'd like to ask you to bring me 60 cases of Cup of Joe and 60 cases of mocha.
[149:09.71]Okay.
[149:11.47]It's 60 cases of Cup of Joe, 60 cases of mocha.
[149:17.17]Have the ingredients for that, right?
[149:21.16]Cup of Joe.

[151:23.02]Are you ready?
[151:23.84]Everyone that said, what the hell are you doing here?
[151:26.70]What am I doing here?
[151:27.53]I'm making almost a million dollars in one trade.
[151:31.17]That's what I'm doing here.
[151:31.91]That was the Omega Lil, not a million.
[151:40.91]That, okay.
[151:42.21]Well, no, no, I didn't make it.
[151:47.57]Big boy coming in with the big bucks.
[151:49.27]Yeah.
[151:49.45]How am I doing on Moroccan coffee?
[151:53.65]I feel like I'm such a guy.
[151:54.65]I was like a wheeler and dealer.
[151:57.44]I just had a coffee in my hand.
[151:58.86]Like, was it ice?
[151:59.52]I took a little sip.
[152:01.02]And I'm like, how am I doing on Moroccan coffee?
[152:02.62]Let's take a quick look.
[152:03.24]Get some inventory up there.
[152:06.06]Let's get a little bit more inventory.
[152:11.80]Looks good to me.
[152:12.24]100.
[152:12.26]You don't have any more caramel left.
[152:21.12]Shit, what do I have?
[152:23.30]Oh, I'm out of, like, candy material.
[152:28.53]I don't have any more candy material left.
[152:30.31]I need to... What should I be making?
[152:36.29]Special Reserve?
[152:41.96]Lemon.
[152:43.54]Raspberry.
[152:44.08]Probably Special Reserve.
[152:48.60]Or is it a coffee time?
[152:50.62]Is it time to go back?
[152:53.12]I think it's time to have coffee.
[152:57.15]Is this straight coffee right now?
[152:58.31]I think so.
[152:59.89]Because I have this guy here.
[153:00.91]But I also am about to have somebody else.
[153:06.45]Tokyo.
[153:06.81]Go to Tokyo.
[153:07.45]Alright.
[153:07.71]I'm going to Tokyo right now.
[153:08.82]Go.
[153:08.94]Alright.
[153:14.28]Here we are.
[153:16.76]Who do I have to talk to?
[153:19.46]Hello silly zonkowonko, and welcome to Japan.
[153:22.14]We have a fantastic factory here, set up to manufacture infusions.
[153:26.90]You'll notice that if you're able to make complete trays with ingredients all the same color, you'll earn a significant production bonus.
[153:32.36]To get you along, here's a recipe for dark chocolate pecan infusions.
[153:38.75]Complete tray with ingredients all the same color.
[153:44.29]Nutty pecan filling encased in the finest chocolate.
[153:46.71]I want one of these.
[153:52.54]I am willing to consider your candidacy to become our CEO, but I'm a man who likes specific goals.
[153:58.96]If you're able to learn at least nine infusions recipes and are able to take ownership of a second retail location, I'll be convinced that you have the skills to lead the company.
[154:08.71]Incidentally, if you look around, you should be able to find pecans you'll need for that recipe I gave you.
[154:13.93]And it seems that Bianca Rabiti over in Tangiers is very interested in getting her hands on some of our dark chocolate pecan infusions.
[154:20.11]She'll pay $20,000 for 32...
[154:24.26]Oh, I can't say no.
[154:27.37]Splendid.
[154:29.29]I'm not sure why she's so interested in our wares, but her money is as good as anyone else's.
[154:33.15]Take those 32 cases to her at the lookout in Tangiers.
[154:37.00]Okay.
[154:38.66]Uh, hold on.
[154:39.18]I need to... Mark it.
[154:42.58]Look on an ingredient.
[154:44.71]Wasabi.
[154:45.61]Oh!
[154:48.26]Oh my God.
[154:49.14]Wasabi chocolate.
[154:50.42]Are you kidding me?
[154:52.02]I want wasabi in... I want... When I make my own, it's going to be chocolate with wasabi in the middle.
[154:59.43]Pumpkin.
[155:00.93]Ginger.
[155:11.42]Station.
[155:11.70]You'd be wise to make sure that you're continually introducing new confections.
[155:14.12]Sure.
[155:15.58]Here's an offer you won't want to refuse.
[155:17.42]A chance to get two new infusion recipes.
[155:20.12]I'll give you the recipe for milk chocolate infusion with allspice right now.
[155:23.72]There were 50 cases as my gift to my friend Daisuke Sato here in Tokyo.
[155:31.38]Station.
[155:32.78]I'll hand over the recipe for vanilla cinnamon infusion.
[155:34.50]It's a deal.
[155:34.80]Okay.
[155:44.38]It can be a smart move to haggle at markets, silly zonka wonka.
[155:48.28]As long as you've got a sense of whom you're haggling with and a good idea about his or her current prices.
[155:53.04]I've seen this lady before.
[155:57.76]Is this lady just on permanent vacation around the whole world?
[156:02.48]I've seen her in like two or three different places.
[156:10.69]Tokyo Tower.
[156:12.69]Silly Zanko Wonka, we are constantly offering official tours of the tower and I need party favors.
[156:17.63]I've heard wonderful things about a couple of products of yours.
[156:20.21]Chocolate bars with raspberry and cinnamon coffee.
[156:23.25]If you promise to bring me 45 cases of each of these products, I will not only pay you well, but also present you with a pair of wonderful infusion recipes that utilize fresh fruits.
[156:33.29]You can count on me.
[156:36.37]The fruits you will need can now be found at the market in Tangier.
[156:43.42]The more chocolate I eat, the more I seem to crave it.
[156:45.10]Okay.
[156:48.83]I need... I need pecans.
[156:52.75]Change recipe.
[156:54.15]I need allspice.
[156:55.17]I need... I want to make my own.
[156:56.64]I have tons of... I need a bunch of pecans.
[157:12.77]Alright, where do I get- where were the last places that pecans were available?
[157:15.84]We have a sea scene in Kona for 229.
[157:21.66]Alright, we're going to Kona.
[157:28.21]I gotta change this.
[157:29.95]How much- no, it's 60 cup of Joe.
[157:31.37]Shit.
[157:31.73]Alright, I gotta go- I gotta fly across the entire world.
[157:36.67]Wait.
[157:37.53]There's so many quests now.
[157:38.41]Hold on.
[157:40.86]50 cases of milk chocolate.
[157:43.98]Infusions.
[157:46.86]32 cases of dark chocolate Buchanan infusions.
[157:51.82]45 cases of cinnamon coffee.
[157:53.04]45 cases of chocolate with raspberry.
[157:55.27]Alright.
[157:57.53]I need chocolate with raspberry.
[157:59.93]We gotta get raspberries.
[158:00.81]Where are raspberries?
[158:08.00]Tangiers.
[158:08.44]Okay.
[158:08.88]Let's go to Tangiers.
[158:16.67]cherries blueberries raspberries three weeks you must be taking a zeppelin alright I need a hundred let's get that going and then cinnamon coffee alright we're gonna do that next it's definitely cherry
[158:45.30]I definitely need cherries.
[158:46.08]I'm going to need them.
[158:51.31]It's either going to be blueberries or cherries with the secret ingredient.
[159:02.43]I'm going to get them now.
[159:07.47]You're rolling.
[159:08.39]Get them both.
[159:11.01]I'll get even more.
[159:17.38]Alright.
[159:17.98]I have a shitload of cherries now.
[159:23.73]I need to change this coffee to cinnamon.
[159:25.59]And we're going to change the chocolate as well.
[159:29.05]Alright.
[159:29.39]I'm right here.
[159:29.97]Let's go change the chocolate.
[159:31.05]What are we doing for chocolate bars?
[159:32.13]We need raspberry chocolate bars.
[159:33.29]Let's go.
[159:42.12]Use that one.
[159:42.66]17 a week.
[159:43.82]Get the fuck out of here.
[159:44.72]Make that better.
[159:45.24]It's going to be laggy.
[159:49.97]I mean, do you eat every single nugget with sauce?
[159:51.93]I don't.
[160:20.66]I would say 70% to 60% of every nugget is dipped in sauce.
[160:25.18]Sometimes you just want a nugget.
[160:28.02]Not every single one has to be dipped in sauce.
[160:39.81]How many raspberries?
[160:52.58]Serial killer behavior.
[160:55.32]I don't dip every single nugget into sweet and sour or something.
[161:04.31]Usually I do.
[161:05.87]And by the way, how many sauces are we talking here?
[161:08.51]Do you guys do one sauce?
[161:09.85]Do you do two sauces?
[161:11.59]Three different sauces?
[161:12.41]How many?
[161:15.33]I would say two to three.
[161:18.00]Usually it's about two.
[161:20.35]Usually it's maybe it's if it's a McNuggets.
[161:24.19]Sweet and sour sauce.
[161:26.54]And maybe honey mustard barbecue.
[161:29.86]Depends on how I feel.
[161:33.72]The sweet and sour sauce from McDonald's is the best.
[161:36.90]That you can find anywhere.
[161:44.23]It's based.
[161:44.81]Well, no, that's yeah, of course it is.

[162:29.51]400 bottles of whiskey.
[162:34.41]Make a custom that's just three whiskeys.
[162:37.45]In fact, we're going to do 500 bottles of whiskey.
[162:44.03]I got a good deal here.
[162:49.85]Do I need any more of this stuff?
[162:51.17]Maybe some more cherries.
[162:57.80]Alright, that's it.
[162:59.92]22 sacks of milk.
[163:01.12]That's a good deal.
[163:02.34]I'll take... I'll take 500.
[163:04.36]Alcohol doesn't go bad.
[163:25.49]And what kind of coffee is Irish coffee?
[163:29.59]Oh, alcohol just gets better with age.
[163:35.97]The recipe for Irish coffee is 600.
[163:37.49]I need cream.
[163:40.39]I don't even need to look at the coffee, so I just need a little bit more cream.
[163:42.49]I need like 200, 300 more cream.
[163:45.41]Good.
[163:46.18]Alright.
[163:47.60]We've got this being made.
[163:49.06]Our quest is for 45 cases.
[163:51.38]It'll be done.
[163:52.38]We're going to go down and make cinnamon coffee down in Cape Town right now.
[164:06.35]Cinnamon coffee.
[164:09.55]Honey Moroccan coffee, plenty of sugar, plenty of cinnamon.
[164:12.06]Use this one.
[164:13.04]Here we go.
[164:18.14]Ingredients that are not alcohol will go bad.
[164:22.18]I'll just, I'm going to put it in like a bunch of oak barrels.
[164:23.94]I'll just put it back in the barrel.
[164:38.91]Oh my god, you know, I try- what do you think I was doing?
[164:45.07]It's so annoying.
[164:58.28]Oh my god!
[165:07.39]No!
[165:07.89]I'm trying to go here!
[165:08.73]Alright.
[165:20.72]These are Among Us kill sounds.
[165:27.57]Alright.
[165:28.43]So by the time that I fly... to... back to Tokyo...
[165:34.40]I will have the inventory that she requires.
[165:37.30]I need to go back to Tokyo with something else.
[165:39.28]Okay.
[165:47.81]I need 60 cases of mocha.
[165:49.59]Shit.
[165:49.69]Alright, we're going... We're going back to Tokyo.
[166:00.68]So I can trade this in.
[166:07.95]Don't have enough?
[166:09.07]Okay, I was gonna say, what?
[166:10.71]Trade these in?
[166:14.55]There you are.
[166:16.91]It's $50,000 and a couple of fruit recipes.
[166:19.73]This is blueberry and cherry.
[166:22.05]Yes!
[166:23.19]I knew it.
[166:23.75]I told you guys it was gonna be cherries.
[166:25.27]I'm gonna make a shitload of these.
[166:27.35]I can make these now.
[166:29.19]So, I'm gonna do cherry.
[166:31.71]We're gonna make a ton of cherries.
[166:33.65]Ton of them.
[166:34.81]Like, 300 of these.
[166:36.45]I'm gonna make them right now.
[166:40.60]We often host special events here at the tower.
[166:42.38]In fact, I could use 45 cases each of the infusion recipes I gave you.
[166:48.11]That's not enough.
[166:50.25]100,000?
[166:50.27]Make that a million.
[166:52.39]45 cases each?
[167:03.53]That would be almost 100k.
[167:05.01]That's 90 cases of what she just did.
[167:06.67]I can get way more than that.
[167:08.39]No thanks.
[167:10.91]Alright, let's actually do the... Let's get it rolling.
[167:15.95]Things about your success.
[167:17.79]Alright, change that recipe.

[167:31.42]And they have this weird coloring system?
[167:37.75]Um...
[167:40.64]Oh, they're just trying to fuck with your head.
[167:42.24]That's two.
[167:56.91]Um...
[168:09.41]Oh, man.
[168:11.47]Wait, why is it color coded?
[168:17.67]I'm so confused.
[168:28.40]What do the colors mean?
[168:29.30]I don't know.
[168:30.36]17 cases a week.
[168:44.22]That's it?
[168:45.66]Only a thousand?
[168:49.31]My delicious cinnamon coffee.
[168:54.99]Same color gets you a bonus.
[168:56.15]Oh, okay.
[168:56.41]Alright, I'm ready to... I'm just gonna... I'm not gonna dump this cinnamon coffee.
[169:04.27]This is gonna be worth way more at my place.

[169:37.15]Who has a couple of fantastic infusions recipes she might be willing to barter for.
[169:41.01]For $10,000, I'll be willing to secure passage for you.

[173:47.68]The remote telegraph.
[173:48.86]Once hooked up, you'll be able to reconfigure your factories without needing to travel there.
[173:52.08]That's insane.
[173:54.22]You can reset factories to any product they have previously produced.
[173:58.75]Believe me, this is well worth $100,000.
[173:59.65]Oh, you bet.
[173:59.93]Okay.
[174:09.96]Oh my god, that's so much better.
[174:11.50]I can do this remote now.
[174:16.87]I don't have to fly across the world to change recipes.
[174:23.72]Perfect.
[174:24.40]Awesome.
[174:24.78]Alright.
[174:25.06]Alright, I gotta pee again.

[190:41.88]Should've made one of those.
[190:42.56]Alright.
[190:48.27]Deep, rich, Colombian chocolate.
[190:51.73]Mixed with the nutmeg, which is... Nutmeg would be on top.

[191:05.66]soup.
[191:08.17]Deep, richest color of the nutmeg with the... Pick it.
[191:15.41]Alright.
[191:18.49]Nutmeg is like this, right?
[191:21.17]So this, I want that to be that.
[191:26.67]What style do I want this to be?
[191:27.85]Because there's whiskey in here.
[191:29.57]Okay.
[191:29.81]I like that.
[191:35.27]Definitely.

[191:38.79]Oh, wait.
[191:39.11]So the whiskey... Now, the whiskey is a dab on top.
[191:44.31]That's a dab of whiskey.
[191:45.19]It's like a toothpaste.
[191:49.29]There's the whiskey dab right there.
[191:52.05]And then that means this needs to be like this.
[191:56.21]Holy shit.
[191:58.55]There's your nutmeg.
[191:59.49]There's your Colombian cocoa.
[192:03.26]Wait, that's honey.

[192:37.49]Alright, this is called the, uh... I don't know.

[195:29.86]I can't do any more mocha, but I needed 60 mocha.
[195:32.04]Did I get 60 mocha?
[195:33.16]Yes or no?
[195:34.51]I do.
[195:34.89]Alright, we can change this coffee.
[195:38.94]We're going to change the coffee to Irish coffee.
[195:41.48]Here you go.
[195:44.66]Oh, I have to go there to do it.
[195:47.87]Anybody want any coffee?
[195:53.53]No.
[195:55.45]I'm ready to go back to Kona with this shit.
[196:01.29]But I have to do this first.
[196:09.40]Let's stop making just an absolute shitload of Irish coffees.
[196:11.98]We're on sub only mode?
[196:17.05]Why?
[196:50.29]I need milk, I need milk, I need milk, I need milk!
[197:05.86]Oh shit, it's going too fast
[197:17.17]Alright.
[197:17.45]That's a lot.
[197:18.87]That's a decent, that's 35 cases a week.
[197:20.37]Nice.
[197:28.21]Only 35.
[197:28.93]That's a lot.
[197:30.33]And that's enough for me to just keep this on forever.
[197:32.38]Alright.
[197:33.76]They are making these.
[197:35.08]How many of these do I own now?
[197:36.26]A lot probably.
[197:38.76]187.
[197:39.08]Who wants these?
[197:40.04]Who would buy these at a decent price?
[197:47.17]Not here.
[197:50.37]Alright, these are doing well.
[197:51.69]How many more do I need?
[197:52.85]Let's go now.
[197:53.35]Let's go to Kona.
[197:55.73]Oh.
[197:58.33]The cherries cost more than the chocolate.
[197:59.77]Yeah, that sucks.
[198:01.47]Ooh.
[198:04.01]You manufacture at least 10 different coffee products.
[198:05.89]Nice.
[198:06.07]Alright, here we go.
[198:15.68]You really know how to work wonders with my beans.
[198:17.99]Stop by and see Leoloa next door.
[198:24.87]I knew this was going to work out swimmingly.
[198:26.81]Trust me, having an outpost here in Hawaii will be great for your business.
[198:29.83]We see a lot of tourists, especially tourists with disposable dollars for confections.
[198:33.45]There's one last thing I'll need you to do.
[198:36.17]Bring me 50 cases each of chocolate with honey, Arabian bold, and your The Cuban Clock Cleaner.
[198:43.35]Oh my god, that's so much.
[198:50.24]Sounds like you had to look down.
[198:52.80]I'll take, uh, 50 cases of chocolate bars with honey, Arabian Bold, and... Your The Cuban Clock Cleaner.
[198:59.80]Aw, damn it.
[199:04.33]Okay, that's a lot.
[199:07.75]I'm just... I'm gonna make Irish coffees for a while.
[199:09.55]I need money.
[199:13.07]I have enough for this special order of, uh, peanuts.
[199:18.53]Okay, we gotta go to Bogota.
[199:21.78]We're gonna start doing infusion stuff for Japan.
[199:23.56]Alright, let's go to Pagoda.
[199:32.61]Here you go.
[199:38.25]I take it your sprite sponge products are earning a healthy profit.
[199:40.77]No, not at all, actually.
[199:47.42]Excellent.
[199:48.38]They are even better than I had led to believe.
[199:50.57]Here's a recipe I mentioned for refreshing dark Colombian cocoa lime infusions.
[199:57.31]Nice.
[199:57.59]Okay.
[200:00.63]My infusions are way better though.
[200:05.05]Can you bring me 45 cases?
[200:06.49]I'll give you a second one.
[200:08.26]Sure.
[200:11.84]You guys like cherries?

[200:31.81]I'm alright for now.
[200:36.15]Are these bad for you?
[200:37.13]Are these bad and you should feel bad?
[200:39.89]What's wrong with you today?
[200:48.45]Okay, I have to do... This order is absurd.
[200:53.71]Chocolate bars with peanuts.
[201:02.44]I need peanuts.

[201:49.20]Thank you.
[201:50.52]Only 18 a week.
[201:51.62]Holy shit, that's horrible.
[201:53.72]It's 60 cases.
[201:54.60]Alright, is it time?
[202:00.38]These cherries, why did nobody like them?
[202:03.30]I'm missing out.
[202:03.81]This is such a horrible loss.
[202:08.57]I keep making Irish coffees.
[202:09.53]They're probably worth a shitload.
[202:13.02]They are.
[202:13.97]Okay.
[202:15.03]Just keep making them.
[202:18.81]I am going to go... I have to sell.
[202:21.31]I'm going here.
[202:28.31]Irish coffee.
[202:29.21]Only 2,000.
[202:31.96]Cinnamon... Are you kidding me?
[202:37.32]Cinnamon coffee is worth more than an Irish coffee.
[202:40.22]Irish coffee has whiskey in it.
[202:53.91]This is spices.
[202:58.01]Joe, make sure I don't need any of this stuff.
[203:05.06]OK, I need Arabian bold.
[203:06.38]OK, no, I don't need any of this shit.
[203:10.48]Get rid of the Cup of Joe.
[203:13.98]Take some money back here.
[203:15.24]Mocha don't need any mocha.
[203:17.96]Irish coffee, really?
[203:19.14]That's it.
[203:25.54]I mean, that's almost half a million dollars, but I feel like I was going to get more than that.
[203:39.36]So he's still not using the sell all button.
[203:41.58]No, I told you why.
[203:44.28]Look, if I hover over sell all, it doesn't say how much I get.
[203:47.44]I just do it.
[203:50.16]Putting in the maximum that I can do.
[203:51.96]It shows you, and I like to see it.
[203:57.36]Uh, I'm gonna hold it for now.
[203:58.70]No, I'm not.
[203:59.66]Gonna revolve it.
[204:03.86]That price is just gonna drop.
[204:04.90]It probably will.
[204:07.89]Uh, I need... Alright, I gotta change this.
[204:12.29]Special order.
[204:17.13]Yeah, the peanuts order is coming.
[204:20.15]50 cases.
[204:20.57]Milk chocolate infusion with all spice.
[204:23.89]Milk chocolate infusion with all spice.
[204:29.58]I have the necessary ingredients but I cannot do it because I have to make it in oh I hate that thing I gotta go back to Japan alright back to Japan we're making some new confections I mean do I hold on to these nobody wants them that's such a low price it's a thousand bucks it's like 1300 bucks for cherries
[205:02.77]Should I just take a loss here?
[205:03.73]Or should I just hold it?
[205:08.91]Alright.
[205:11.47]The rest of this junk we're getting rid of.
[205:12.71]No more sprite sponges.
[205:21.41]Peanuts we need.
[205:23.19]Do we need caramel?
[205:24.57]I don't think we need raspberry anymore either.
[205:26.23]No.
[205:28.09]No.
[205:34.08]Chocolate with peanuts, chocolate with caramel.
[205:35.40]I don't think I need these either.
[205:41.20]I need to make new infusions though.
[205:42.62]Alright, new infusion.
[205:44.86]What do I want to do?
[205:48.98]This is the one with all spice.
[205:51.26]Let's do this one.
[205:53.38]Alright, I'm going to try to do this right.

[207:03.50]I thought I was doing bad.
[207:04.48]Alright.
[207:05.94]It's really important just to do that.
[207:06.98]Okay.
[207:14.50]You sell cream?
[207:15.48]No.
[207:19.32]Oh, that's what happened.
[207:21.58]I bought the cherries at the most expensive they ever were in the course of the game.
[207:25.70]They're $474 now.
[207:27.44]They were $1,300 like a month ago in-game.
[207:34.15]Well, then I'm just gonna... I'm gonna... The price is probably just gonna keep going down.
[207:36.83]Just sell them all.
[207:37.89]Sell them all.
[207:39.29]The price is gonna keep going down.
[207:40.21]Get rid of them.
[207:41.15]I don't even want them.

[215:03.21]These chocolate bars of peanuts are perfect.
[215:04.72]Look forward to ordering from this company again.
[215:07.22]That's a clean $120,000.
[215:09.18]Nice.
[215:16.96]Irish coffee.
[215:17.68]No, it's still cheap.
[215:22.75]I'm going to hold on to those.
[215:23.47]They're junk, right?
[215:25.37]But whatever.
[215:28.41]Do I have enough Arabian Bold?
[215:35.03]No, I need 50 Arabian Bold.
[215:36.83]One more week.
[215:38.39]Let's go back to Tokyo.
[215:47.98]Turn this in.
[215:51.72]A gift from Yoshikawai.
[215:54.24]How wonderful!
[215:54.92]He must have known I'd give you this recipe for vanilla cinnamon infusions.
[215:59.67]Note that the vanilla you need for this is now available in Douala.
[216:05.07]I had an opportunity to get vanilla.
[216:08.47]By the way, we got an unusual situation.
[216:12.34]Reiko Tsunade over at Nakamise Market has gotten her hands on a thousand sacks of cocoa.
[216:18.06]She's not going to be able to sell here.
[216:20.50]If you bring her 31 cases of vanilla cinnamon infusions within two months, she'll give you all that wonderful cocoa in exchange.
[216:29.47]Wait, that's 10,000.
[216:29.85]Ha!
[216:34.84]That's 10,000 sacks.
[216:39.38]I'll take it.
[216:40.04]Yeah, sure.
[216:40.96]That's insane.
[216:41.86]That's 10,000 sacks.
[216:45.01]I'll never have to buy it again.
[216:46.21]What do you got?
[216:52.39]Give me wasabi.
[216:52.99]I want it in my recipes.
[216:56.33]And ginger.
[216:56.73]I want to be able to put ginger in my recipes.
[216:59.83]I have 200 pumpkins.
[217:00.94]What am I doing with these?
[217:08.31]I got the Arabian Bold.
[217:09.23]I can stop with the Arabian Bold.
[217:12.17]I can actually sell the Arabian Bold here if I wanted to.
[217:15.97]But I'm not going to.
[217:16.67]We're going to keep making it.
[217:20.04]What was the other thing that she wanted?
[217:21.76]The Cuban Clock Cleaner.
[217:28.70]I need Cayenne pepper.
[217:31.70]Wait, somebody was going to give me Cayenne pepper.
[217:33.16]A lot of it.
[217:34.30]Where's that quest?
[217:46.80]Did somebody give it to me?
[218:02.07]She didn't give it to me.
[218:02.69]I thought she gave me a hundred.
[218:16.40]You have to make it.
[218:17.48]Oh.
[218:18.76]Alright, how do I make this shit?
[218:27.15]It's this one.
[218:29.17]Okay.
[218:30.31]I can make 25, 25, 25, invest, use this recipe.
[218:31.65]Let's do it.
[218:32.07]Hit this right.
[218:47.99]Um... Uh... I can't throw this away.
[219:01.08]Whatever.
[219:09.03]Blue.
[219:09.37]It's blue.
[219:09.89]It's blue!
[219:12.55]Ah!
[219:14.31]Um...
[219:19.49]Shit.
[219:22.41]Fuck.
[219:40.86]Oh boy, that was bad.
[219:42.22]Do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again.
[220:03.94]Shit.
[220:08.82]Mmm.
[220:26.05]Uh.
[220:27.53]Mmm.
[220:29.13]Mmm.
[220:46.59]How many cases?
[220:47.43]50 cases a week?
[220:56.10]Jesus.
[220:56.42]Alright.
[220:58.24]I need anise.
[220:59.26]We're going to go to Douala.
[221:00.56]We're going to Douala.
[221:01.26]We're going to bring a ton of peppers and anise.
[221:03.56]Let's go.
[221:12.81]I thought this was going to be cheap.
[221:19.35]I want to see you do something with your prices for me.
[221:21.65]Might there be a little bit of wiggle room?
[221:22.71]You're charging tourist prices here.
[221:24.09]Do something for me or I take my business somewhere else.
[221:26.59]Yeah.
[221:28.42]That was a tourist price.
[221:29.20]I need cocoa.
[221:46.23]I have to just do it temporarily.
[221:50.27]What about vanilla?
[221:51.35]Get the vanilla?
[221:58.86]Oh, this is so much money, though.
[222:01.50]Get vanilla?
[222:03.06]That's so expensive.
[222:04.42]Should I get 200?
[222:05.06]Okay, that's good.
[222:08.17]That's good, that's good, that's good.
[222:16.49]What am I making over here?
[222:21.85]This is a... Okay.
[222:23.47]Very curious.
[222:24.15]31 case of vanilla cinnamon infusions.
[222:30.84]Vanilla cinnamon infusion.
[222:31.92]So I need cinnamon.
[222:33.88]How much cinnamon do I have?
[222:36.06]Not a lot.
[222:36.50]Let's buy it here.
[222:37.22]Because it's cheap here now.
[222:48.57]Okay.
[222:48.79]Vanilla cinnamon infusion.
[222:52.31]Alright, you gotta make something else here.
[222:53.91]What do I have?
[222:54.47]What can I make?
[222:54.95]I have a shitload of lemons.
[222:57.73]Why do I have so many lemons?
[222:59.09]Just make them, whatever.
[222:59.81]Let me keep an eye on you.
[223:15.78]Gentlemen, this is Joe Zidon.
[223:17.02]Not to be confused with Joe Biden.
[223:18.42]I'm willing to take one billion off the debt if you let chat create their own candy bar.
[223:34.38]That coffee pasta, really?
[223:36.82]Jerma, it's me, Joe Ziden.
[223:38.74]Not Joe Biden.
[223:40.30]Let chat make a candy for a billion off the debt.
[223:42.80]Joe Ziden.
[223:45.90]That's it?
[223:53.08]It's going to be hard to do that.
[223:57.00]You bought a thousand lemons from that lady to spite her the other day.
[223:59.57]Oh, right.
[223:59.89]Okay.
[224:03.83]I need... Wait, there was something else I needed to do before I got sidetracked.
[224:10.48]You.
[224:11.02]Okay.
[224:12.80]That's going good.
[224:14.60]What do I need for coffee?
[224:17.04]Anything else?
[224:17.56]For coffee?
[224:19.86]Chocolate bars with honey.
[224:21.02]Do you sell honey here?
[224:23.78]You do not.
[224:27.46]Okay.
[224:28.24]Where do they sell honey?
[224:35.46]Whatever funds he has at the end of the game, he gets off the debt times 100.
[224:38.08]Oh, shit.
[224:42.21]You guys ready for that one?
[224:53.01]Deal, deal, deal, deal.
[224:54.37]Alright, hold on.
[224:59.68]How about this?
[225:01.20]Whatever I have at the end of the stream tonight...
[225:05.86]times 100 but I have to scroll my mouse over the casino at least once a month in game I have to I have to I have to click on the casino at least once a month
[225:35.66]That's so easy.
[225:36.50]Every once every two weeks.
[225:42.36]No, that's I have to be able to play the game.
[225:43.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[225:49.70]You must have more than 2 million in profit.
[226:00.08]No, no, because I just have to not gamble, which I mean, that's debt money.
[226:04.91]I can do it.
[226:05.93]No, no deal.
[226:07.93]No deal.
[226:13.89]Yeah, it's too easy.
[226:14.69]No deal.
[226:17.87]Let's go to the coffee shop and sell our Arabian Bold.
[226:23.24]We have too much of it.
[226:25.71]It's worth a lot, though.
[226:26.37]I'm just going to keep making it.
[226:28.55]Do I have enough to make something that's worth more?
[226:30.15]Did you sell nutmeg here?
[226:34.05]Holy shit.
[226:49.60]I'm going to get nutmeg.
[226:57.97]I'm going to go back to Tokyo.
[227:02.79]Actually, no.
[227:07.23]Oh, that's right.

[228:01.94]I'm alright.
[228:02.60]I got time.
[228:02.96]Alright.
[228:06.00]We need to do... What the hell am I doing here?
[228:09.76]Right.
[228:10.14]Honey.
[228:13.48]And you got any wiggle room?
[228:14.38]This is horrible.
[228:16.04]You probably suck.
[228:16.85]I don't care.
[228:17.31]Fuck you.
[228:39.53]I need 50 Cuban clock cleaner and 50 chocolate bars with honey.

[229:14.78]Marvelous!
[229:15.30]Thank you for tracking me down here.
[229:16.98]And for bringing the spicy dark chocolate infusions.
[229:20.26]Hope the recipe serves you well.
[229:23.68]Thank you.
[229:24.08]Wait, what did I do that for?
[229:31.10]Shit, I gotta pay a premium on this.
[229:32.32]100 million for a Jar Jar Binks impression.
[229:42.83]No.
[229:45.58]Okay.
[229:46.72]I'm going to go back to Tokyo.
[229:47.64]We're going to do Vanilla Cinnamon Infusions.
[229:49.12]Tokyo Quest, please.

[230:06.49]Wait.

[230:45.60]Alright, I got it.
[230:46.02]I got it.
[230:47.23]Honey, I can go back and we can finally have this stupid partnership with the Hawaiian shop.
[230:56.51]Okay, don't sell the honey.
[230:58.50]Don't sell the Arabian bull.
[230:59.58]Don't sell the Cuban clock cleaner.
[231:01.44]Everything else can go.
[231:05.22]Oh, the chocolate bar was peanuts.
[231:06.62]Get the fuck out of here.
[231:15.45]Irish coffee.
[231:17.83]Yeah, I sell this shit too.
[231:21.22]Milk chocolate with allspice.
[231:26.00]Who wants that?
[231:31.78]Why do I have so many of these?
[231:32.81]Alright, here we go.
[231:36.83]Change recipe.
[231:38.49]Vanilla cinnamon infusion.
[231:39.83]I have enough.
[231:40.97]Let's get it.
[231:42.01]Use this recipe.
[231:46.32]And yes, I'm giving it away.
[231:47.54]What is that?
[231:59.05]What is that from?
[231:59.97]I know that.
[232:01.03]Why do I know that?
[232:05.49]Why do I know that?
[232:06.21]I fucked it up.
[232:17.27]Come on, man.
[232:22.09]No!
[232:39.90]Come on, come on, come on.
[232:40.92]Ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-
[232:47.01]Whatever.
[232:49.35]31 cases.
[232:51.71]How many does she want?
[232:56.37]Oh, I got it.
[232:59.04]You usually look delicious, silly Zonka Wonka.
[233:01.44]Here you go.
[233:01.92]Here's 10,000 cocoa.
[233:02.58]I think it's scammed.
[233:10.55]No, there it is.
[233:15.51]10,000 stacks.
[233:16.64]I'll never have to buy another one.
[233:20.06]Alright.
[233:21.30]I have reached my limit here.
[233:23.46]I need to go back to Kona.
[233:27.20]Wait.
[233:27.42]Dark Chocolate Pecan Infusions.
[233:28.95]I feel like these are going to be worth a lot of money.
[233:35.15]I'm going to let this ride for a little bit.
[233:36.39]This is probably going to be worth a shitload of money.
[233:41.54]Let's go do the partnership.
[233:49.87]What we got here for coffee that I can still make?
[233:51.37]I could do Arabian Bold.
[233:55.29]I got plenty of coffee for that.
[233:56.37]Yeah, let's just throw in Arabian Bold for the trip.
[234:02.33]Let's change this over to, uh... Lemon for the trip.
[234:06.76]Let's go.
[234:16.97]One time I was at a candy store buying a nice treat for my son.
[234:19.05]Jerma came up from behind us and kicked my son like a football.
[234:26.37]This shop is now yours.
[234:29.53]Premium prices for all your goods.
[234:32.78]Oh my God.
[234:35.44]That's the ticket right there.
[234:38.50]Oh my goodness.
[234:39.60]We're about to make lots of money.
[234:42.20]So this is, I'm going to wait.
[234:43.96]This is 93. $100,000.
[234:50.89]Let's go.
[234:52.01]Give it to me.
[234:52.41]I'll take it.
[234:54.70]Milk chocolate infused without... Why is this so cheap?
[234:58.78]Sell it all.
[235:10.15]We just crossed 2 million.
[235:13.63]Sell everything.
[235:16.60]That's 2.2 million.
[235:24.74]I'm going to load up on cinnamon and vanilla.
[235:27.04]We're going to go to Douala.
[235:36.02]Go to Douala.
[235:36.66]Let's buy a shitload more of this.
[235:40.93]Go to the casino.
[235:41.93]That's not a bad idea, but not yet.
[235:46.92]Silly Zonkowonka.
[235:48.22]What if I told you that I've just come from a special place, a magical place, a place not on your map, where fortunes are won and lost?
[235:55.13]And perhaps, more importantly for you, a place where one can find fresh, beautiful strawberries.
[236:00.28]Would you do something for me if I can get you such a place?
[236:02.66]Yeah?
[236:04.78]You won't be disappointed.
[236:05.66]The place is Las Vegas, Nevada.
[236:08.40]There are riches to be had there.
[236:10.56]But beware, I nearly lost my kimono.
[236:13.02]All I would like you to do is to get me a hundred sacks of strawberries.
[236:15.52]I'll find you in a couple of months.
[236:20.21]Oh, we got it.
[236:20.79]Let's get your strawberries right now.
[236:26.21]We get a ticket to Vegas?
[236:28.07]I'm going home.
[236:28.65]What are you trying to do?
[236:32.37]Rip me off?
[236:35.89]get sucked into a wormhole!
[237:16.05]Come on, hurry up and make these.
[237:17.39]He's in the game.
[237:22.10]Okay, have a hundred sacks of strawberries.
[237:29.24]Where do I get the strawberries?
[237:30.50]Did she tell me?
[237:37.51]Where do I get them?
[237:45.62]You get them in Vegas?
[237:46.56]But, like, it says, have a hundred sacks in your inventory.
[237:48.98]She'll find you.
[237:54.51]I have to have the strawberries in my inventory, don't I?
[238:06.20]You're so stupid.
[238:08.60]You're so vain.
[238:10.60]You probably think this song is about you.
[238:14.36]About you.
[238:16.38]You're so vain.
[238:17.96]I actually should get some of this.
[238:20.26]Yeah, why not?
[238:24.94]Give me some.
[238:25.26]Alright, I have some quests.
[238:34.32]45 dark Colombian cocoa lime infusions.
[238:40.26]Do I have any limes?
[238:48.45]Holy fuck.
[238:50.77]Yeah.
[238:50.95]78 cases with just honey.
[238:51.81]$200,000.
[238:51.83]Let's go.
[239:04.19]okay dark chocolate cocoa lime infusion alright I need some more colombian cocoa we need to go to bogota not yet let's go to Tokyo get this started go to Vegas now I hold on let me I know just give me a second
[239:28.39]Just give me a second.
[239:29.35]I'm going to go home real quick.
[239:31.77]I didn't know that Vegas was in this game.
[239:33.13]There's probably slot machines fucking everywhere.
[239:35.31]I can't wait.
[239:35.89]Okay.
[239:53.42]I'm going to make these first because I want to get this out of my inventory.
[240:53.22]What?
[240:53.72]I didn't miss?
[240:55.00]Fuck!
[241:00.74]Fuck!
[241:04.86]Uh... Whoa, wait, I see $500,000.
[241:12.63]Silly Zonkabonka, I'm sure you're aware of how high travel costs have gotten.
[241:19.17]Bad news is that this trend is likely to continue.
[241:22.11]The good news is that I am here to offer you a corporate airline.
[241:25.65]For an investment of $500,000, you'll be able to fly direct from any port to any port, and all of your future travel costs will be zero.
[241:35.54]This certainly makes a difference as you fly in and out of secret ports.
[241:38.72]And this is not even considering the bump to your style and grace.
[241:41.08]What do you say?
[241:44.06]I'll take it.
[241:44.96]It's half a million dollars.
[241:45.86]Private airline.
[241:46.36]Let's go.
[241:49.73]Think about how much we lose going back and forth.
[241:52.41]It's like $2,000 or $3,000 a trip.
[241:57.08]My corporate airline is ready to go.
[241:58.38]I got 154 cases.
[242:03.96]Let's change this to the one with the lime.
[242:10.32]Use this recipe.
[242:10.94]Let's go.
[242:20.89]And then we go bang, bang, bang, bang.
[242:41.50]Shit.
[242:45.33]Shit.
[242:47.01]Shit.
[242:48.85]Shit.
[242:50.64]Shit.
[242:53.34]Shit.
[242:59.70]No!
[243:00.54]I just messed it up.
[243:03.12]Oh, the one with the doubles just fucks up my head.
[243:06.58]I don't... Look at this dog shit we're getting.
[243:12.40]I need limes.
[243:13.08]I haven't seen a lime in like two years.
[243:14.75]I didn't see a... No, do that again.
[243:17.67]No lime came up.
[243:18.47]The RNG was terrible.
[243:53.71]I just got electrocuted.
[243:54.75]I just put both hands on the stove.
[244:11.50]Limes, limes, limes, limes, limes, limes.
[244:13.44]I need limes.
[244:15.48]Whatever.
[244:19.96]That's fine.
[244:20.76]That's good.
[244:26.20]Actually, is that enough?
[244:33.04]32 cases.
[244:33.50]Wait, where is it?
[244:38.08]45 cases.
[244:38.52]Okay, well, whatever.
[244:39.20]I need Colombian cocoa.
[244:46.66]Okay, what happened?
[244:47.48]I need to... I'm running out of coffee.
[244:49.04]Alright, we'll just make Cafe La Leche for now.
[244:56.76]Throw this on... Yeah, we'll just do secret.

[267:41.69]You've done it.
[267:42.87]You've earned my endorsement.
[267:45.51]By showing me your ability to accumulate recipes for infusions, way to go.
[267:49.47]There's still plenty of work to be done, but you are making excellent progress.
[267:52.19]I have no doubt you're going to succeed.

[268:07.41]Not everybody born in Boston goes to Harvard.
[268:09.25]It's just a thing that people say that are from Boston, so you think that they're smarter than they actually are.
[268:15.35]Yeah, we got Harvard here.
[268:17.33]You didn't go there.
[268:18.49]Yeah, I know, but it's here.
[268:20.39]That means we're all intelligent here.
[268:22.67]That's not what it means.
[268:23.19]You didn't go to Harvard.
[268:31.80]Yeah, throw it away.
[268:33.66]Oh, my God.
[268:34.08]I tried to throw it away.

[269:13.28]It hurts my head.
[269:16.86]Look, not everybody that lives in Boston went to Harvard, okay?
[269:20.20]We just went over it.

[285:59.90]I thought that was raw meat for a second.
[286:06.78]Here's the deal.
[286:07.32]Each of the other members of the board of directors, some of whom you've met, some of whom you haven't, is holding a truffle recipe for you.
[286:15.04]What you need to do is present each member with a case of truffles to exchange for their recipe.
[286:21.05]The tricky part is you need to figure out which recipe goes with which board member.
[286:24.67]Oh boy.
[286:29.15]Each of the ingredients you will need to make each of the five truffle recipes are at a market somewhere.
[286:35.28]What the hell are you trying to tell me to do?
[286:40.54]Travel to Toronto and Wellington now where you'll meet the remaining members of the board.
[286:47.14]Each board member will yell, yeah, you know, and give you a rah, but how do I know what they like?
[286:56.75]When you show up with the correct type of truffle in your inventory... Whatever.
[287:03.69]Go to hell.
[287:08.32]How many do I have?
[287:08.82]21. 21.
[287:16.21]But for now, I gotta do the lime.
[287:19.61]Gotta get lime chocolates.
[287:22.85]Yeah, let's go do, let's get the lime thing ready.
[287:24.49]Oh, this is the, I'm almost done with my shitty pecan investment.
[287:31.84]Go ahead and change it to that so I can, and then where does he, where does he live?
[287:38.04]Uh, Pagoda.
[287:41.58]And then we're gonna go, we're gonna just go to Toronto and then Wellington and see what happens.
[287:51.36]Thank you.
[287:51.88]It's like $300,000.
[287:52.42]That's that done.
[287:57.59]I need to get 11 truffle recipes.
[288:00.19]40 cases of mango clove infusions.
[288:09.33]Mango clove, huh?
[288:10.67]I got clove.
[288:14.97]I need mango.
[288:17.91]Who sells mangoes?
[288:24.74]I don't know.
[288:27.64]100 million if you do the Truffle Shuffle.
[288:38.19]I'm not going to do the Truffle Shuffle.
[288:39.57]Sorry.
[288:40.83]I have 100 strawberries.
[288:41.77]Alright.
[288:43.03]Back to Tokyo.
[288:47.01]No.
[288:58.57]I need to have some type of chocolate production going here.
[289:00.93]Alright, I'm just gonna do raspberries.
[289:04.22]There are raspberries here.
[289:07.84]There are not raspberries here.
[289:08.72]What the hell even is here?
[289:10.32]Pumpkin chocolate.
[289:12.52]Hazelnut.
[289:12.78]I'm gonna do hazelnut chocolate.
[289:13.76]Let's just buy a shitload of this.
[289:21.93]Yeah, just use this one.
[289:23.85]And that's a horrible... Are you kidding me?
[289:25.63]Do I really have to travel back there to make that better?
[289:28.87]Just thinking about it, I was.
[289:29.93]Alright, Toronto.
[289:47.50]Big town market.
[289:51.60]Nothing really here.
[289:52.64]Waterfront Suites.
[289:56.62]It is true, indeed.
[289:57.72]I'm holding onto a truffle recipe for you.
[289:59.88]It is also true I'm looking for you to have a particular truffle on hand before I'm willing to hand it over.
[290:04.45]Okay.
[290:05.83]These are still worth a lot.
[290:15.83]Breakfast blend.
[290:16.63]Alright, I gotta... I gotta go to breakfast blend.
[290:20.20]Dark chocolate pecan infusions.
[290:26.18]I got to dump a bunch of stuff.
[290:27.52]I have to sell.
[290:29.06]All my quests are done.
[290:31.02]Yeah.
[290:31.70]Time to sell a huge bunch.
[290:32.86]It's time to dump.
[290:42.07]Oh.
[290:43.67]As long as you're using an ingredient at one of the factories, it will not expire.
[290:48.61]After a number of weeks of not using it, however, the ingredient will expire.
[290:52.32]Okay.
[290:52.92]That makes sense.
[291:02.42]I need to go sell.
[291:04.82]Let's take a trip to... Let's go to Tangiers.
[291:06.64]I'm going to dump everything.

[296:54.77]Let's do it.
[297:00.45]What if I happen to dig in for gold?
[297:02.99]Um, I think it just sucked.
[297:05.14]I didn't get a chance to make it.
[297:06.74]Oh, for the love of God.
[297:33.55]That was a shitty RNG again.
[297:37.87]Terrible RNG.
[297:38.61]Just awful.
[297:40.03]Really awful.
[297:42.37]It's truly terrible RNG.
[297:43.57]Like what a disaster.
[297:44.15]Let's do it again.
[298:25.07]Much better.
[298:25.71]Much better RNG.
[298:38.67]So much better.
[298:39.35]Oh, this is like the god run.

[299:15.09]So that's good.
[299:16.41]Breakfast blend is still just cranking out.
[299:21.20]37 per week.
[299:22.02]Hazelnut chocolate bar.
[299:23.38]Look at all these white truffles.

[299:32.20]We're gonna go get more Balinese and Colombian coffee.

[300:33.11]So, these are going.
[300:33.91]They'll be going for a little while.

[302:19.18]You guys ready to cross at least the 3 million mark?
[302:24.12]Here it comes.
[302:28.93]Look at this breakfast blend.
[302:31.25]Dark chocolate infusion with ginger.
[302:35.13]It's crossed three million, we say.
[302:42.61]No, don't sell this here.
[302:43.59]The coffee shop guy has a better price.
[302:56.82]Yeah, coffee shop guy has a much better price.
[303:03.82]Whatever.
[303:04.12]I just messed up.
[303:04.89]I was going to do 200, but I did 320.
[303:06.53]Don't care.
[303:09.65]The Rain Streamer is panic selling all of his stocks.
[303:16.07]I want to go change the recipe to this.
[303:17.88]So we have to go to Tokyo.
[303:18.66]First, I'm going to take a stop in Cape Town.
[303:24.10]Now, why am I going to Cape Town?
[303:27.76]Where are the new recipes coming from?
[303:28.96]I don't know.
[303:30.69]I didn't want to go here.
[303:31.33]I messed up.
[303:43.41]Over three million dollars.
[303:44.93]Today was supposed to be a fun Kinect stream, not some shitty chocolate game I'd find on my grandma's PC.
[303:51.17]Ban that person.
[303:52.67]For at least an hour.
[304:06.38]No, you know what?
[304:07.19]We'll dial it back to 20 minutes.
[304:11.61]We have to face the truth.
[304:18.75]What?
[304:20.82]I like the chocolate money-making simulator.
[304:28.12]I'm playing Kinect tomorrow.
[304:30.10]Okay, look.
[304:31.34]This is not... Okay.
[304:33.12]I didn't say, guys, today we're going to play Chocolatier again.
[304:36.63]Oh, and by the way, I burnt the Kinect.
[304:40.05]I put it into a giant fucking steel trash can along with all the Kinect games and I light them on fire.
[304:46.92]I smashed it.
[304:47.68]I stomped on it like grapes and I made fucking connect wine.
[304:51.05]That didn't happen.
[304:52.89]It's right behind me.
[304:53.91]We're doing it tomorrow.
[304:58.41]But now, I'm enjoying making chocolates and getting $5 million.
[305:04.23]You see, that's what happens.
[305:06.43]Once I get to $5 million, I'm going to go gamble until I get to $10 million or turn the stream off.
[305:12.13]That's what's going to happen.
[305:20.39]I'm going to save it first because I like this game.
[305:23.01]It's kind of fun.
[305:26.10]So now we got to do the... What are you doing, Otto?
[305:30.74]Almost running out of breakfast blend.
[305:33.14]Let's take it.
[305:33.54]We'll go to Tokyo.
[305:37.53]Yeah, I want to do the mango.
[305:40.29]Oh, nice, Otto.
[305:43.23]I want to sneeze.
[305:43.91]I'm not about to sneeze.
[306:01.87]Here we go.
[306:02.59]This is gonna be a big, big money maker I got.
[306:04.80]I'm gonna make 500 of these.
[306:06.04]I need snowballs.
[306:38.50]They're trying to make it harder on me.
[306:44.66]They're trying to make it harder.
[306:52.48]Shit.
[306:52.67]It's okay.
[307:06.56]Come on, get me higher than 50 cases.
[307:09.02]I just need the cases.
[307:10.04]51 cases.
[307:12.78]Bingo.
[307:20.14]There we are.
[307:20.64]51 cases.
[307:22.74]Time to go turn this into Tangiers.
[307:33.17]Breakfast blend.
[307:35.43]Come on, give me 5 million.
[307:39.37]You silly zonka wonka.
[307:41.01]You're a gifted chocolatier.
[307:42.11]Here's the recipe I mentioned.
[307:43.07]It may be a while before you can get a hold of all these specialty cocos, but it'll be worth it.
[307:47.61]Ooh.
[307:48.49]Blended cocoa, dark chocolate infusion.
[307:55.67]Where's Peruvian cocoa?
[308:03.25]Oh, need more Moroccan coffee.
[308:04.50]No, we don't.
[308:07.51]I need Bolognese and Colombian.
[308:11.75]Bolognese and Colombian.
[308:12.59]Okay, Bolognese, coffee.
[308:15.05]I need hazelnuts.
[308:21.43]Fuck, that wasn't a hazelnut.
[308:23.05]That was a nutmeg.
[308:28.91]Oh, that's a lot.
[308:29.75]Can we make a nutmeg chocolate by any chance?
[308:42.04]Oh, thank God, digging for gold is nutmeg.
[308:49.43]I need hazelnuts.
[308:50.33]Alright, Balinese coffee, Colombian coffee.
[309:00.92]Go.
[309:08.16]Uh, give me a better deal where I'm getting out of.
[309:09.84]No.
[309:10.10]No.
[309:18.81]God damn it, I need it.
[309:20.31]I have to do it.
[309:31.11]I'm going to make it back.
[309:31.99]I need it.
[309:34.67]I need Colombian coffee.
[309:45.12]You got owned.
[309:46.36]I did.
[309:54.95]Maybe he won't be mad at me anymore if I go back there.
[309:57.41]Let's see.
[309:57.73]Can you haggle somebody until they give up on their business?
[310:03.43]Oh, fuck.
[310:03.77]Let's go to Wellington.
[310:04.47]I haven't even been here yet.
[310:05.35]Don't even give up on their business.
[310:10.72]You're doing swell, silly Zonkawonka, and I very much look forward to working with you soon to launch our exotics.
[310:18.78]Oh, God.
[310:19.31]Oh, God.
[310:23.79]I mean, launch your exotics.
[310:30.84]Pass the whiskey.
[310:31.86]It's all... Wait, it went bad.
[310:35.84]I had 500 whiskey and it went bad.
[310:37.14]I bought these for like $200,000.
[310:40.14]I'm very bad at this, but it's still fun.
[310:53.54]It doesn't matter.
[310:54.53]I'm just losing money.
[310:56.17]Hand over fist.
[310:57.51]Whatever that saying is.
[310:58.29]I should have done something with success.
[311:07.65]What else do I have to do here?
[311:08.45]Alright, here we go.
[311:17.72]I'm going all the way back to flying across the whole world.
[311:22.74]You seem to be in a big hurry.
[311:23.90]Three million.
[311:35.04]Four million.
[311:35.52]Let's go.
[311:38.36]Come on.
[311:40.72]Four million.
[311:41.46]Coming on.
[311:45.90]There's so many truffles.
[311:48.40]That's four million.
[311:49.50]We're almost there.
[311:51.43]Somebody tell you the casino guy looks like you.
[312:19.20]The raid?
[312:23.00]Did I sell everything?
[312:26.26]Was there a raid?
[312:28.86]It was.
[312:30.58]From the gray fruit.
[312:33.58]Hey, I got plenty of gray fruits on me right now.
[312:35.92]Thanks for the raid, dude.
[312:37.90]Take a look.
[312:39.02]Wait, that's not gray.
[312:39.78]Do I have a gray fruit?
[312:42.16]I thought I had a gray fruit.
[312:43.34]Well, this one's kind of gray.
[312:44.44]Thanks for the raid.
[312:48.81]Welcome, everybody.
[312:50.94]We are getting... We're trying to get to $5 million in the chocolate game.
[312:56.98]And in the chocolate game, when you get to $5 million, you go to the casino and you spend it until you get to $10 million and you turn the stream off.
[313:01.22]That's what's going to happen.
[313:05.04]You're losing your vision?
[313:07.28]That's gray right there.
[313:10.22]I didn't say the whole fruit was gray.
[313:14.48]This is gray.
[313:15.64]Right there is gray.
[313:17.98]That's not green.
[313:19.08]What are you talking about?

[313:50.36]That's green.
[313:52.06]That's gray.
[313:54.00]This is green.
[313:54.80]That's gray.
[313:55.60]This is green.
[313:56.38]That's gray.
[313:57.06]How is this?
[313:57.68]How is what?
[313:58.72]Where my cursor is right now.
[314:01.32]How is it green?
[314:02.00]That's not green.
[314:06.76]You guys are liars.
[314:07.48]You're just fucking with me.
[314:09.64]What was I even doing?
[314:13.66]Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[314:14.74]Getting to $5 million.
[314:15.86]$5 million.
[314:21.81]Okay, I need to... Truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles.
[314:27.67]Here we are.
[314:28.18]Alright.
[314:29.38]I want to make the Bowser one.
[314:31.08]Spicy currant truffles.
[314:34.40]I'm going to currants, Cayenne peppers.
[314:37.85]I'm going to go to Wellington.
[314:38.89]Wellington, we're going to do this.
[314:46.55]Let's recap it in eyedrop tool and paint and look at the RGB value.
[314:50.29]One of you will do it and then I'm gladly will show it on stream.
[314:56.21]What are you crazy?
[314:57.17]Okay, is that what I needed?
[315:20.22]200, 200, 6,000, 6,000, 700.
[315:20.34]Alright, I need a bunch.
[315:21.12]I'm going to get 500, 500, 500.
[315:22.26]Let's go for... How many do I have?
[315:23.38]Go on, one more.
[315:24.38]This is going to be the big ticket.
[315:25.24]Now I need powder.
[315:25.86]It's hex, zero, zero.
[315:51.52]Put your money where your mouth is.
[315:52.44]Let's be 100 million that it's green according to an RGB value.
[315:56.62]But here's the thing, though.
[315:57.38]What if it is green on the RGB scale, but it's like a gray green?
[316:02.49]The RGB is hash.
[316:03.43]Hold on.
[316:14.64]Green is still green.
[316:16.20]Wait, hold on.
[316:16.94]If it's green, but if it's gray too, then why am I wrong?
[316:21.84]How come you get to be right if it's green in there, but I get to be wrong if there's gray in there?
[316:27.23]Isn't that fair?
[316:31.83]Because it's green.
[316:33.27]Why can't it be both colors?
[316:35.45]It's gray.
[316:37.95]Life isn't fair.
[316:41.12]You said it was gray.
[316:42.56]Show it to me.
[316:43.02]Give me the RGB value.
[316:43.94]I want to see it.
[316:46.18]Gray isn't a color, buddy.
[316:47.64]Oh, sorry.
[316:51.26]Sorry.
[316:52.18]Gray is not a color, I guess.
[316:56.11]It's... What is it?
[316:57.37]5-5 something?
[317:00.81]Give me one sec.
[317:04.87]I'm all tabbing for this.
[317:09.57]It is... Hash 5-5?
[317:11.51]L-D-Megan?
[317:18.98]Turning links on.
[317:21.30]Does anybody have it?
[317:26.18]5E... 5E573D.
[317:27.20]Is that a lie?
[317:28.90]Is that the right one?
[317:30.75]5E573D.
[317:31.09]That's bullshit.
[317:39.57]That's not even right.
[317:46.41]That's not even correct.
[317:50.54]That's a troll color.
[317:51.30]You're fucking with me.
[317:53.50]That's not the right color.
[317:55.18]By the way, that's like yellow.
[317:56.84]You guys were wrong.
[317:58.20]If you think it's that one, that's yellow.
[318:05.11]It's 5-5.
[318:06.33]Somebody got the right one.
[318:07.03]Let me see it.
[318:07.39]5-5-5-5-23-E.
[318:11.39]5-5-5-23-E.
[318:21.03]No, that's not right.
[318:21.63]You just picked it.
[318:24.34]Give it Discord.
[318:25.70]I want an image.
[318:27.38]I demand it.
[318:27.94]I command it.
[318:39.15]You changed... That's not what it looks like on my screen.
[318:41.01]Can I screenshot mine?
[318:45.73]Is my color wrong on my computer?
[318:55.66]It doesn't look like this on my screen.
[319:05.13]That doesn't look like that.
[319:05.97]Why is yours way darker?
[319:15.59]Does it look like that?
[319:17.33]Mine is way lighter than that.
[319:19.36]I'm going to take a screenshot.
[319:27.96]Everybody hold on a second.
[319:36.91]Print screen.
[319:39.73]Hold on.
[319:43.09]I'm going to put this up next to this.
[319:47.47]I feel like this is a lie.
[319:48.37]Hold on.
[320:07.71]A crop?
[320:08.99]Is it the same picture?
[320:31.38]Whatever.
[320:35.42]Um.
[320:36.66]So.
[320:38.91]My monitor's colors are fucked up bad.
[320:43.03]It is not.
[320:45.63]It is incredibly.
[320:46.73]It's five times lighter when I look at it.
[320:49.00]Oh, boy.
[320:52.46]This is the image I just took.
[321:08.50]And in fact, I think this is darker.
[321:14.05]Alright, but just do me a favor.
[321:16.59]Do me a quick little favor here.
[321:18.35]And I know you say green, green, green.
[321:20.75]Green, green, green.
[321:21.75]But what is that?
[321:23.67]What's that right there?
[321:25.31]That little sliver there?
[321:26.64]That little white area?
[321:28.12]What is that?
[321:34.92]What color could be in there?
[321:37.98]Gray?
[321:38.34]My monitor is fucked.
[321:44.71]It's way lighter on my screen.
[321:47.43]That's mold.
[321:49.39]Whatever, I don't even care.
[321:58.45]I was so... Alright, well, good thing I didn't bet.
[322:01.71]I didn't bet any money.
[322:05.41]What the fuck happened?

[372:06.73]I don't know.
[372:07.31]We can use them.
[372:08.97]What do we use them for?
[372:10.19]I don't know.
[372:11.05]I probably should have.
[372:12.55]2020 hindsight.
[372:13.61]Probably should have.
[372:16.66]Probably should have got like milk and like something.
[372:20.42]I don't know.
[372:21.44]Sell the limes.
[372:22.30]You can't sell limes.
[372:24.56]We're going to be Lime City.
[372:26.48]Oh, what?
[372:26.72]You got a casino here?
[372:27.70]Oh, of course.
[372:29.72]Can I use limes to play the slot machine?
[372:35.47]Make a lime recipe.
[372:36.71]That's only limes.
[372:38.83]Oh my God.
[372:45.79]Oh.
[372:49.19]Wait, okay.
[372:49.73]I just paid her $7,500.
[372:50.41]And then she just paid me $2,500.
[372:56.42]She just paid me another $2,500.
[372:57.70]She gave me another $2,500.
[372:59.60]What is wrong with you?
[373:15.19]I so badly want to do this and just make like a thousand of them.
[373:18.11]Come on.
[373:19.47]I need to get another spot.
[373:23.38]No, I can't delete a spot.
[373:26.28]I can't make just a fucking all lime truffle?
[373:28.64]I need truffle powder.
[373:45.11]Flavors.
[373:45.91]Where's truffle powder?
[373:55.14]Do a new bar?
[373:55.85]I can't.
[373:56.71]I don't have any more slots and I can't delete slots.
[374:09.80]I have to do this whole quest.
[374:12.20]It's going to take hours.
[374:14.18]Ugh.
[374:25.35]Come on, really?
[374:26.07]You have to fill all the evi- Oh, come on.
[374:33.33]Start over.
[374:40.46]You're lime locked.
[374:42.92]Load the save?
[374:44.40]I didn't make my own truffle yet.
[374:46.00]I didn't unlock it.
[374:50.06]See?
[374:51.32]I have not unlocked the truffle.
[374:55.37]Load the old save.
[375:02.68]My old save didn't have the billion dollars.
[375:12.06]You owe me $10,000.
[375:13.28]If I were you, I'd get the dough together.
[375:15.32]Just a reminder, you owe me $20,000.
[375:17.58]I'll find you.
[375:18.90]This is a friendly reminder.
[375:20.00]You owe me $10,000.
[375:21.14]I'll be seeing you around.
[375:26.30]Just a reminder, you owe me $10,000.
[375:27.87]Get that dough.
[375:28.51]You owe me $20,000.
[375:28.95]I'm gonna find you.
[375:30.57]You owe me $10,000.
[375:31.37]I'll be seeing you around.
[375:33.35]Hey, uh, neat line.
[375:37.44]Get the dough together.
[375:38.14]I'm gonna find you.
[375:40.42]Where do I buy, like, a fucking gun or something to protect myself?
[375:43.64]I gotta hide somewhere.
[375:44.86]Just coming after me with, like, hitmen.
[375:58.42]I'll find you.
[375:59.40]Okay, sure you will.
[376:01.54]I'm like one of those famous people on Earth.
[376:04.40]I'm the guy that made a billion dollars in three days and then bought a billion dollars worth of limes.
[376:10.86]I've been all over the news and you'll know where I am.
[376:12.60]Maybe she can't find me if I just fucking fly everywhere.
[376:19.60]I got a private jet.
[376:20.30]She won't find me.
[376:31.67]Wait, hold on.
[376:31.95]Wait a second.
[376:38.80]That was $1 billion in 1952.
[376:39.34]What's that now?
[376:39.70]Was there even a billionaire in 1950?
[376:40.54]What would that be?
[376:41.62]Was there billionaires in like 1930, 1940?
[376:42.68]$10 billion.
[376:43.12]$10 billion.
[377:03.55]Howard Hughes?
[377:04.97]What was Howard Hughes worth back in like 1940, 1950?
[377:10.12]Rockefeller was before that.
[377:11.06]How much was Rockefeller worth?
[377:21.44]He was worth 3 million limes.
[377:23.02]So Rockefeller was worth 10 billion dollars.
[377:27.15]So I was worth more than Rockefeller.
[377:29.07]9.8 billion.
[377:36.55]Agent 47, this is Jeremy Elbertson, also known as Mr. Green.
[377:40.63]Yes, wait.
[377:42.17]I can't read this.
[377:44.07]I can't read this.
[377:44.57]It's going too fast.
[377:46.25]Agent 47, this is Jeremy Elbertson, also known as Mr. Green.
[377:49.78]He has been known as the Lime Salesman.
[377:54.40]Who owns over 3 million limes.
[377:55.82]His debt is high, but the price is higher.
[377:58.16]Get to work, 47.
[377:59.50]You'll be able to know who he is
[378:06.89]by his very, very quintessential lime green skin.
[378:11.85]Some say it's from eating 200,000 limes over the last two years.
[378:16.89]47, he's very dangerous and is always surrounded by his henchmen.
[378:21.99]Who are also lime green skin.
[378:26.92]Imagine playing like this.
[378:28.48]Find the guy, find like the lime guy.
[378:30.68]His henchmen, the banana bros.
[378:35.48]Are shaped like bananas.
[378:37.56]They've also been eating fruits only.
[378:41.08]I don't think this lady does anything.
[378:43.26]I think it's just only threats.
[378:48.06]Yeah, she's gone.
[378:49.18]I think I lost her.
[378:50.90]The benefits of having a private jet.
[378:52.18]She can't find me.
[378:53.89]Yeah, I lost her.
[378:57.12]She has no idea where I am.
[378:58.16]You're going to have to get... Hey, you're going to have to get a bunch of fucking sixth graders to try to find me on a game show.
[379:04.18]Where in the world could I be?
[379:05.34]You're not going to find me.
[379:06.24]Honestly, I really think that she's gone.
[379:18.41]I think I win.
[379:21.03]January 12th, 1952.
[379:26.74]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[379:27.38]I win.
[379:32.57]She died trying to find you.
[379:37.33]I win.
[379:37.75]I escape.
[379:38.87]No, I didn't.
[379:44.57]I want to know if she like kills you.
[379:53.50]Oh, by the way, these are going to go bad.
[380:07.27]flying around in a jet, a cargo jet with 3 million limes, just panicking.
[380:14.05]And by the way, they're going bad in a week.
[380:19.48]Wait, she's giving me more money.
[380:21.58]Listen, silly Zonka Wonka.
[380:23.80]I'm going to take that $10,000 that you owe me.
[380:26.18]You should do a better job minding your finances.
[380:28.72]I'll be willing to loan you money again, of course, but my interest rate's going up.
[380:32.87]Jeez.
[380:40.33]Get $20,000 together.
[380:42.07]Okay.
[380:47.60]I'm going to get it from her.
[380:49.00]This lady's nuts.
[381:04.21]She just paid herself the loan back.
[381:05.91]Maybe she was sick of me.
[381:09.68]Coin, coin, coin!
[381:12.40]Yes!
[381:20.24]Alright, I know I owe you money.
[381:29.80]Coin!
[381:30.72]There it is.
[381:31.06]Alright, is she gonna take the money?
[381:36.68]Well, hello there, silly Zonkawonka.
[381:38.76]I'll take that $20,000 we agreed to.
[381:41.04]Goodbye.
[381:43.28]Oh, silly Zonkawonka.
[381:44.38]Fancy seeing you here.
[381:45.54]I'm going to give you $10,000.
[381:46.12]Here, of course.
[381:46.66]Take $10,000.
[381:46.80]Do I owe her money still?
[381:51.75]Did I finally get to the end?
[381:52.65]Yeah.
[382:01.96]That entire fiasco netted me $10,000 that I don't have to pay her back.
[382:17.35]That's the scam.
[382:18.51]Just fly around the world for three months to make $10,000 from somebody that you're just scamming.
[382:35.96]No, these are my limes.
[382:37.83]No one's getting these.
[382:45.07]I'm done.
[382:53.96]Alright, just for shits, I just want to see if I reload the game.
[383:00.26]If I have like 500 million dollars.
[383:05.71]Let's find out.
[383:10.35]If I just force quit the game.
[383:11.97]Don't save it.
[383:12.73]Just quit the game.
[383:13.81]Just force quit the application.
[383:14.97]Because you have to save and quit.
[383:18.79]If I just force quit.
[383:21.39]Do I still have 500 million dollars?
[383:22.97]Okay.
[383:31.77]Here comes a moment of truth.
[383:35.78]Does the game autosave?
[383:38.84]If not, then I win.
[383:41.30]Find out.
[383:49.19]And... Oh, oof.
[383:52.51]Oh, it autosaves.
[383:53.41]That's a big oof.
[383:56.35]Ooh, that's a big oof.
[383:57.69]That's a huge oof.
[383:59.45]Oh well.
[383:59.83]Do I still have my limes?
[384:00.81]I do.
[384:02.53]I do.
[384:07.15]I'm good.
[384:09.64]I win.
[384:16.08]That's it.
[384:16.28]I'll see you tomorrow.
[384:17.54]We're going to play Connect tomorrow.
[384:18.58]We're going to play Connect the most first.
[384:22.43]I'll see you guys later.
[384:24.25]Thanks for joining me.
[384:25.23]That was Chocolatier Decadence.
[384:27.69]Delightful Decadence.
[384:28.45]I don't know.
[384:28.81]It's a great game.
[384:30.65]Made a billion dollars.
[384:32.65]Actually surprised we got there.
[384:39.86]Oh, this is where I get the phone call from the guy that I yelled at.
[384:42.40]That said I was going to buy all the shares of his company and he heard what happened.
[384:49.39]He calls and he just says, Hey, you want $2,500?
[384:53.11]I go, shut up.
[384:58.49]You shut up.
[384:58.91]I'll get you.
[385:03.53]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[385:05.83]Let's do the credits.
[385:08.73]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[385:11.29]That's probably the last time you will see Chocolatier.
[385:15.92]It was a good one.
[385:21.84]There were a lot of community subs today, as you can see by how insane this is going by.
[385:27.10]Thank you.
[385:29.70]Oh my goodness, I just burped.
[385:30.70]I don't have a longer one tonight, but I feel like we had to see that through.
[385:41.85]We will catch you tomorrow.
[385:43.66]Connect.
[385:44.36]Let me see how many games I have.
[385:47.60]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[385:48.12]There are like 10 Connect games that I have to play.
[385:54.36]I'm going to spend a bunch of time in Connectables, though.
[385:56.70]That's the plan.
[386:03.25]So, in the meantime, let's see here.
[386:12.78]Uh, we are going to go... I'm going to send you guys to Vinny.
[386:23.51]What's he up to?
[386:23.97]What's Vinny up to?
[386:28.03]And no raid songs, okay?
[386:30.33]Stop the raid songs.
[386:32.05]Here we go.
[386:33.37]If somebody's busy and they're into something or doing something or talking about something, don't force people to do a goddamn raid song.
[386:39.18]You're making us look like assholes.
[386:46.13]You know, I've gotten DMs from people saying, hey, man, what's with the fucking Raid song?
[386:50.41]Stop doing this fucking Raid song thing.
[386:51.99]And I'm like, I'm sorry, dude.
[386:52.81]And he's like, no, it's your fault.
[386:54.44]Don't fucking talk to me anymore.
[386:56.02]Don't talk to me anymore.
[386:57.48]And I go, dude, what the fuck?
[386:58.56]I'm sorry.
[386:59.00]And he's like, don't.
[386:59.90]I just told you not to talk to me anymore.
[387:07.59]Who did that?
[387:09.79]No one.
[387:11.87]I made up a person again.
[387:19.09]But really though, like let people like stream.
[387:21.19]If somebody doesn't want to do the raid song, don't like demand they do something.
[387:26.95]Are they going to be mad at me?
[387:28.09]It comes back to me.
[387:28.89]Alright.
[387:31.83]I'll see you guys later.
[387:33.05]Let's go raid Vinny.
[387:33.71]Go say hello.
[387:34.25]I think he's doing a podcast.
[387:38.16]Talk shows and podcasts.
[387:42.94]Final Fantasy 7 stuff.
[387:44.16]Mario 3D World FTL.
[387:45.56]Okay, cool.
[387:49.79]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[387:51.65]Good night.
[387:52.07]Goodbye.
[387:52.41]Take care of yourselves.
[387:53.69]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[387:56.63]Good night.
[388:42.23]Thank you.
[389:17.21]you
