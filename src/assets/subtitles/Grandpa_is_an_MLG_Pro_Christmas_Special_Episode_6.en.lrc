[00:05.36]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06.92]Welcome to episode six on a Christmas special.
[00:11.05]Hope you're having a fantastic Christmas day for all of us here.
[00:15.51]Frank, shut up.
[00:17.80]I think... Shut the fuck up, Frank!
[00:19.68]Alright, Jesus Christ.
[00:20.28]Okay, so what we're going to do today is me and my bridge club are going to play you a special holiday song.
[00:27.75]And we're going to do it over some Modern Warfare 3, Battlefield 3, and Team Fortress 2 gameplay the way it should be on Machinima Respawn.
[00:38.78]So you'll know the words if you want to jump in and sing along.
[00:42.24]Everybody, happy holidays!
[00:44.22]Let's do it!
[00:46.38]Whenever you're ready to get in there, Frank.
[00:47.86]Let's do it, buddy.
[00:48.56]We're doing a small prank.
[00:51.49]Here we go.
[00:52.11]Everybody know the words.
[00:53.85]Dashing through the snow.
[00:56.19]With a one-horse open sleigh.
[00:58.95]All the way we go.
[01:01.22]Laughing all the way.
[01:03.58]Bells on my tail ring.
[01:05.42]Frank, you're doing it wrong.
[01:07.08]Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
[01:13.05]Hey!
[01:13.65]Stop it!
[01:14.71]Stop it!
[01:15.13]Frank!
[01:16.15]Start over.
[01:16.93]You've missed an entire fucking lyric.
[01:18.87]You've been doing this all night, okay?
[01:21.33]I don't know how many beers you've had, but you need to cut back a little bit.
[01:24.61]Calm down.
[01:25.04]Calm down.
[01:25.56]Alright, alright.
[01:26.60]From the top now.
[01:27.58]Let's do it again.
[01:28.78]Don't screw it up this time.
[01:30.58]Alright, whatever you say.
[01:33.70]You know what?
[01:35.14]Get the fuck off this thing!
[01:37.38]I'll do it!
[02:00.19]Stupid fucking idiot!
[02:01.79]Get out of my house!
[02:02.99]Get the fuck out of my house!
[02:05.23]I will kick the shit... Let me at him!
[02:07.75]He's ruining my fucking Christmas party!
[02:09.52]Hey, whoa, shut up!
[02:10.04]Whoa, whoa!
[02:10.96]Alright, when I can hear you guys from the neighbor's Christmas party to this Christmas party, something's going on.
[02:16.14]What the hell is going on here?
[02:17.52]He's a dick that should be killed.
[02:20.44]I didn't do anything!
[02:21.90]Why is the keyboard broken in the corner?
[02:23.88]What the hell happened?
[02:26.13]Alright, alright, listen, listen.
[02:27.71]You guys don't want the cops called on this house.
[02:29.99]I don't want that either, so cut the shit.
[02:32.43]Okay.
[02:32.61]I'm going back to the Stevenson's.
[02:34.47]I don't want to come back here again, so just chill out, alright?
[02:36.85]Okay, whatever.
[02:37.87]Okay.
[02:38.45]I will see you guys later tonight.
[02:40.01]Bye-bye.
[02:40.62]Okay, see you later.
[02:41.62]Sorry, Jeremy.
[02:43.40]Alright, I'm sorry.
[02:44.88]Alright, from the top this time!
[02:46.30]Let's do it again!
[02:47.10]The keyboard's broken.
[02:49.08]Oh, shit.
[02:51.28]Um... Does anybody want any more vodka?
