[00:00.90]Hey, what's happening guys?
[00:02.10]Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[00:04.26]Today I'm going to be playing on Modern Warfare 3.
[00:07.89]And I gotta tell you, this is a pretty, pretty awesome gameplay.
[00:10.97]Not because of the numbers.
[00:13.17]Alright, this is not a good gameplay because of the numbers.
[00:16.39]I go 24 and 7.
[00:18.33]I just kind of jumped into this game.
[00:20.27]I got sucked in.
[00:21.05]Somebody must have rage quit.
[00:22.63]Somebody must have disconnected.
[00:24.00]I don't know what happened.
[00:25.76]I just clicked on free-for-all and it went, oh, we're going to load this up for you.
[00:28.94]Hold on one second, my friend.
[00:30.16]Here we go.
[00:30.52]Here we are.
[00:31.64]And I just got dropped into somebody else's game that was in the middle of progress.
[00:36.34]It's like, okay, let me just grab my gun and try and win the game now when I'm down by 500 points.
[00:42.01]Which actually is the goal for this particular gameplay.
[00:46.01]Trying to be the comeback kid in this gameplay, guys.
[00:48.57]We'll see if it works.
[00:49.49]I'm not going to spoil it for you.
[00:50.61]We'll see what happens.
[00:51.79]So the gun I'm using is the PM9.
[00:54.71]The attachments on it are rapid fire and reduced kick.
[00:58.29]The strike package I'm using is my pretty much default, the UAV, the predator missile, and the attack helicopter.
[01:04.01]Just got the attack helicopter right there, and I have my predator missile as well.
[01:08.46]I'm afraid to use the killstreaks in a free-for-all, guys, only because right there, if I had used it right there, remember, you're very, very vulnerable for a good one or two seconds while you press it, and I always, it always seems that I press that button and get shot in the face while I'm pressing it.
[01:24.42]happens all the time.
[01:25.94]So that's why I'm very, very cautious whenever I play free-for-all and have a killstreak ready to go.
[01:31.61]I always hold onto it for a second.
[01:33.60]Here is my first death right here, and I definitely should not have been doing that.
[01:38.44]I shouldn't have been aiming down the iron sights.
[01:41.20]Using an SMG and with the attachments I have on it right now, I have rapid fire and I have on reduced kick.
[01:47.46]So, why would I be aiming down the sights at somebody?
[01:50.66]And if you're wondering, Jerma, why don't you just put on a red dot sight or put on one of the assault rifles?
[01:55.32]I'm terrible with the assault rifles.
[01:57.09]I never was good at iron sights.
[01:59.23]That's mainly the reason why I played Counter-Strike, because Counter-Strike doesn't have iron sights.
[02:04.30]You don't use an iron sight, you don't have to go down the scope and go down the sights, because I was very bad with it, and I still am quite bad with it.
[02:10.61]That's the number one reason why I use the SMGs in this game, because the SMGs are very close to mid-range, and it's all about, you know, jumping around corners, sneaking around a side, trying to get in very close range of somebody.
[02:21.53]And I still find myself aiming down the iron sights with people that are a hundred feet away, thousand feet away, thinking I can kill them, when I'll get one or two hit markers on them, and they'll just do what that guy did, just turn around and aim down their sights and shoot me and kill me in five seconds.
[02:36.10]And it's just like, what did I do wrong?
[02:39.26]And then I realize, oh, right, this is an SMG, and he has probably a friggin' assault rifle.
[02:45.04]What am I doing?
[02:46.44]Now, I don't just spray people, guys.
[02:48.36]Like, I do use the iron sights for close to medium-range fights.
[02:51.84]You've probably seen it a few times already, this gameplay.
[02:54.08]But I'm talking about long-range, long-distance fights with people.
[02:57.20]That's what I mean.
[02:58.60]So right now what's going on, I promise you guys I am not camping.
[03:01.85]This is not me camping this spot.
[03:04.11]Take a look at the mini-map.
[03:05.25]They have an attack helicopter and it is right here.
[03:08.31]And I literally can't go anywhere.
[03:10.19]If I step out of here I'm gonna get myself killed.
[03:11.91]See this guy was actually trying to take it down with a grenade launcher or something and I just shot him.
[03:17.50]I was being a jerk.
[03:18.64]So see how I'm getting shot at from behind right now?
[03:20.46]There's only this little corridor I can stay in.
[03:23.08]Spray this last guy right here.
[03:24.52]Get my attack helicopter.
[03:25.74]That was the main reason why I wouldn't move out of this corridor.
[03:29.12]Because I had my killstreaks going pretty high.
[03:30.90]Wanted to make sure I got my attack helicopter.
[03:33.56]So I got it.
[03:34.16]Let's press the button.
[03:35.32]Boink.
[03:35.96]Here comes my chopper, baby.
[03:38.35]Turn around.
[03:39.01]I see this guy.
[03:39.81]Try and go for another long-range iron sight kill with an SMG.
[03:43.93]Not gonna happen.
[03:44.83]I get myself killed.
[03:46.41]Pulling out the predator missile, dropping it on this guy's skullcap, get the kill.
[03:50.85]Getting very close to potentially taking over the lead here, guys.
[03:54.09]I'm only 150 points behind the guy in first place.
[03:57.03]So right there, I just started to rage.
[03:59.41]You should have heard me.
[04:00.73]I think I said every swear word in the dictionary right there.
[04:03.99]Because I thought I was going to take it over.
[04:05.79]I thought I was so close.
[04:06.81]I was like, come on, that was my journey.
[04:09.88]I can't believe it.
[04:11.36]As you can imagine, I get pretty close, but I start to lose it right here.
[04:15.70]Getting very, very frantic.
[04:17.48]I come up here, kill a couple more people.
[04:19.32]I'm in try-hard mode right now, guys.
[04:21.32]I really want this.
[04:22.86]I thought this was going to be the best comeback gameplay ever.
[04:26.09]I was like, this is awesome.
[04:27.51]I'm going to do it.
[04:28.01]I'm going to do it.
[04:28.59]Right here, I was thinking, I'm going to do it.
[04:30.43]Here's a guy right here.
[04:31.19]Let me just kill him.
[04:31.83]Iron sights.
[04:32.23]He's really close.
[04:33.33]Nope.
[04:34.29]I died.
[04:34.79]Oh my god.
[04:37.37]See, at this point, I kind of realized it was over, and I did not get the victory I wanted, but it was still a very interesting gameplay.
[04:45.62]I came in, they were already in progress, and I ended up getting right up to second place pretty quickly.
[04:50.56]So thank you guys so much for watching.
[04:52.36]I really do appreciate it.
[04:53.48]If you like this video, go ahead and shoot me a like, and I will see you guys all next time.
[04:58.41]Take care, everybody.
