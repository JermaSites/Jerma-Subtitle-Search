[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]I had one real banger.
[00:05.68]What game are we playing?
[00:06.54]I need to download it right now.
[00:08.42]Lego Party.
[00:09.86]Wait, Lego first or another one?
[00:12.91]We can do whatever you guys want.
[00:14.33]There's some decent options.
[00:16.31]There's obviously Lego Party.
[00:18.47]There's also Ranch Simulator or Crime Simulator.
[00:24.66]Oh, that's all the options?
[00:26.29]I mean, that that's, I just looking at the list.
[00:29.23]And that's Oh, because he asked me what I wanted to play.
[00:32.16]And then you said, LOL, look at my viewer count kid.
[00:34.82]And then you suggested those two.
[00:37.16]Okay.
[00:38.51]That's fair.
[00:38.91]Wow.
[00:40.43]I didn't say LOL, though.
[00:43.31]Yeah, you're more of a low L guy now.
[00:45.72]Well, what did you want to play?
[00:47.23]Lowell didn't read any of the group chat and then said this is what we're playing you linked a pinned message and the pinned message has ranch simulator crime simulator no what did I say after that I have like a full paragraph phantom squad you want to play phantoms no we'll play like ranch simulator or another another drive together friends game
[01:17.77]When you said Phantom Squad, none of the other boys said anything.
[01:22.56]I don't know about Phantom Squad.
[01:25.86]Yeah.
[01:26.77]I don't want to look it up right now, fellas.
[01:29.19]It looks like, oh, this is the first time you're looking it up because I've brought up Phantom Squad three times.
[01:34.61]Uh-huh.
[01:36.66]Mostly positive.
[01:40.14]Hmm.
[01:41.48]It doesn't say overwhelmingly positive to me, sir.
[01:44.85]Oh, well then look up Ranch Simulator.
[01:48.50]Hey, hold on a second here.
[01:51.17]The first one of these is overwhelming.
[01:53.37]When I brought up Ranch Simulator to you like three months ago, it was like, this seems like a good idea.
[02:00.30]That's not the point of contention.
[02:02.72]I agree that Ranch Simulator will be a fun time.
[02:04.76]It's just that nobody read my message and this is the third time that I've suggested Phantom Squad.
[02:10.15]Well, you play him too much Battlefield.
[02:14.71]I want to throw this one out here again, Jerma.
[02:16.69]You could have called at any time.
[02:19.35]I don't want to play Battlefield.
[02:21.84]I do.
[02:22.10]Do you have an extra code?
[02:24.10]Do you know how I can get one?
[02:26.16]Get what?
[02:27.30]A code for Battlefield.
[02:32.53]I'll play that with you guys right now.
[02:34.30]You can buy it.
[02:36.18]Oh, that's how you get a code?
[02:37.54]Yeah, that's how I got mine.
[02:39.64]No, I'm joking.
[02:41.87]Do you want to play Lego Party at first?
[02:43.69]Because my chat is really into Legos.
[02:47.38]and I am playing a bit of lego party it's really good are we doing lego party if it's Ster wonderful I I would have said the sir said we would do that after guys phantom squad and then lego party and then the ranch simulator putting my foots down you know what poke I respect that oh you respect when poke does it I respect when poke does it as well as my buddy Jerma yeah
[03:13.47]Okay.
[03:14.77]Let me just get it.
[03:16.61]I already have it.
[03:17.63]It just needs to be installed.
[03:18.85]Give me a sec.
[03:21.88]It'd be pretty quick.
[03:23.34]Wait, which game?
[03:24.32]Phantom Squad.
[03:25.18]Phantom Squad.
[03:27.08]Alright.
[03:28.10]I'll buy that real quick.
[03:29.46]Yeah, same.
[03:32.33]See, sir?
[03:32.79]No, sir.
[03:34.03]You see, this is your choice.
[03:36.85]And I want to respect...
[03:41.23]I'm currently downloading the game, so...
[03:43.90]uh vinny didn't stop talking because I'm downloading the game and it's great choice yeah Ster has gout so he can't put his foot down you know that's a meat that's fucked up chat member hey Ster I don't play phantom squad I was born wrong next time we should just honestly get every game 77 we will stop dropping the call in a second
[04:11.49]I'm kidding.
[04:12.19]So we don't sit here like, you know, maybe with this game, we should have the like, who has like, I don't I don't refund games personally ever.
[04:20.74]Yeah, same.
[04:21.86]Also, it's like we got to get Gabe Newell's like Steam Diamond account, which just makes every single game available so we can just play all of them.
[04:31.39]OK, let's do the Four Horsemen.
[04:34.80]Gabe Newell would sponsor the Four Horsemen.
[04:37.86]Opening Phantom Squad now.
[04:43.45]Jack, be patient.
[04:44.31]Lego Party will occur, I promise.
[04:46.11]Oh, we're going to go hard in Lego Party, by the way.
[04:48.07]There's going to be stakes on that.
[04:51.32]Yeah, I got a new computer.
[04:52.32]I haven't had the chance to test it on RoboCop yet, but it's pretty good.
[04:59.13]Oh, do you actually get a new computer?
[05:03.42]Yeah.
[05:03.60]What is it?
[05:05.68]A custom show.
[05:06.56]I don't know.
[05:07.52]Ooh, nice.
[05:09.54]have a 50 80. uh 50 90. Jesus you got a 50 90. my god yeah it was a loud headshot the game intro is loud I freaked out poking I I always mute everything now I'm too I'm so paranoid now alright alright um you got a 50 90 in there yep holy
[05:35.68]The whole reason I built a new computer, I was going to replace everything except for my GPU, but then I got it all set up and I was like, what the hell?
[05:43.90]So nonchalant.
[05:45.36]What are you using it with?
[05:46.55]Just Battlefield mostly?
[05:47.73]Or is there any other games you want to get maximum performance out of?
[05:51.23]White Knuckle.
[05:53.21]We were playing Absalom.
[05:54.73]It was a really good game.
[05:56.29]I heard that was good.
[05:57.39]Castle Crashers.
[05:58.62]Maybe Ball X Pit.
[06:01.58]Vinny, you're in this game.
[06:02.78]You're in the cinematic.
[06:05.09]You're in the cutscene.
[06:06.69]I just skipped it.
[06:07.91]Is a guy like me?
[06:09.33]Yes.
[06:10.06]So are we doing tutorial off stream?
[06:11.70]On stream, but off?
[06:13.22]It says we should do it.
[06:14.54]Or are we just going in?
[06:18.61]We should do no tutorial.
[06:19.89]No tutorial?
[06:20.69]Just going in?
[06:21.95]It'd be better if we don't know what we're doing.
[06:23.56]Okay.
[06:24.92]I'm ready for whatever.
[06:26.90]Alright.
[06:28.88]I actually love when we open a game and try to host a session.
[06:33.13]That's my favorite part.
[06:35.06]Yeah, that's when the horsemen are at their best.
[06:38.90]What do you mean, host a session?
[06:41.13]Like, who's inviting?
[06:42.29]Did you get the invite?
[06:43.19]Oh, fuck, my Steam's offline.
[06:45.17]Shit like that.
[06:46.17]See, like, I try and be that guy, and I make, like, lists of the games, and Jerma fucking berates me about my list, and then overwrites the list anyway.
[06:55.72]Or you could just say, you know, picks one of two other games on the list that you provided.
[07:01.47]I picked two games on the list.
[07:03.78]I picked one.
[07:05.16]Three times.
[07:07.10]You added Phantom Squad.
[07:09.47]Late.
[07:10.97]Yeah, so like, why should I make the group?
[07:12.37]You make the group.
[07:13.45]We're gonna join your group.
[07:15.90]You just didn't come into my group.
[07:18.42]This is...
[07:19.40]The vibes are fucked.
[07:21.18]They're rancid.
[07:22.77]Ster's coming in hot today.
[07:24.77]Well, fucking, Vinny hates me.
[07:27.04]I do not.
[07:29.26]People assume I hate you because of the way I act.
[07:34.99]Hold on.
[07:36.35]Let me correct the record.
[07:37.89]I do hate him.
[07:39.20]Okay, let me just make sure that's very clear.
[07:42.02]But I love him.
[07:44.30]Yeah, I like the video a lot.
[07:48.23]What's up, Poke?
[07:49.33]Nothing.
[07:50.55]Keep your enemies close.
[07:52.01]It was a dumb joke.
[07:53.88]I don't want to hear it.
[07:54.96]I watched the Vinny Hatester compilation.
[07:58.74]Yeah, someone was like, Vinny, do you want to see this?
[08:00.57]I was like, no!
[08:01.39]And then I fucking banned them from my life.
[08:02.95]Wait, it's a real thing?
[08:04.27]I haven't seen it.
[08:05.03]I just know it exists.
[08:06.64]Wait, I just made it up.
[08:07.48]Yeah, there is a video that exists about me and Star hating each other.
[08:11.10]And the freaks that done all those clips and put them in there.
[08:14.72]totally out of context and they don't include any of the positive moments okay and now I'm dead because Ster killed me oh he hates you and I'm the host what I thought we were all shooting each other wait are you this isn't my game how did I join wait you guys just joined off steam yeah I got a steam invite from the alpha I respect alphas dude everyone respects an alpha

[08:47.38]You guys are alive.
[08:48.10]I'm dead.
[08:48.96]Can we revive?
[08:50.34]No, don't.

[14:14.06]Are you giving us a way?
[14:18.10]Ready or not?
[14:19.67]We play that.
[14:21.11]No, I did.
[14:22.81]We should play that one day.
[14:23.63]It's like top down ready.
[14:27.02]Take a swap.
[14:27.98]It's walking.
[14:32.52]This is co-op Hotline Miami.
[14:34.94]I love Hotline Miami.
[14:35.78]Blueprints.
[14:37.95]I think I had the biggest crash out of my entire life playing that game.
[14:42.38]Whoa, I'm down.
[14:44.10]Yeah, back up.
[14:44.64]That was a lot of gentlemen.
[14:47.98]What happened, Jerma, that you crashed out so hard?
[14:50.83]There's one level, especially in Hotline Miami 2, where there's a bunch of mirrors or a bunch of windows people can shoot through.
[14:56.90]There's windows on, it goes straight through windows across the entire game.
[15:00.91]So anybody in the game that has a line of sight can just shoot you.
[15:04.20]And I think I, I actually think I bit my controller.
[15:08.54]I made teeth marks on it and I had to go to the dentist and actually had to get like tooth caps and stuff because of it.
[15:14.12]Oh my God.
[15:14.90]No, I just don't want you to think that's real, but it's pretend if I did.
[15:17.76]Oh, alright.
[15:18.52]That's crazy though, man.
[15:21.41]The genuine, oh my god, that was... That was great.

[15:40.45]Wait, how'd you get up there?
[15:41.77]Can you just respawn?

[18:38.19]I thought you killed them.
[18:38.93]Yeah, you did.
[18:39.59]You did.
[18:40.65]I locked in and I was able to get the job done.
[18:44.30]Let's breath the... Let's breath the... Oh, it's hostage!
[18:48.51]I'm going to get the hostages back to the doorway.
[18:51.64]It's such a good thing that this game was so kind to give each of us three revives.
[18:57.40]I used two of my healths on me.
[18:59.82]Dude, it's going to be like Hitman.
[19:01.17]We're going to get one star because too many bad things happened.
[19:05.87]At least... Oh, wait, wait.
[19:09.19]Which one is floor 34?
[19:10.29]How do we even know that?
[19:12.34]Can we check up here?
[19:14.46]What about up here?
[19:16.50]Oh my god!
[19:17.88]We're fine.
[19:19.54]Two hostages here.
[19:23.76]Get up.
[19:26.11]Grab that other one.
[19:26.89]There's another basement area here.
[19:29.59]Nice.
[19:33.35]That was a big deal because I've got two hostages right here.
[19:36.86]Okay.
[19:37.28]Is there an extraction point?
[19:39.78]I don't know.
[19:42.20]I don't know either.
[19:43.15]I'm sure there is.
[19:43.65]Put all the hostages over here.
[19:48.57]Okay.
[19:50.53]There's two here.
[19:51.56]Just have them stay.
[19:53.38]There we go.
[19:56.12]Four have to stay alive, so we have five.
[19:59.29]I got one right here.
[20:04.07]I'll watch the hostages.
[20:06.28]Okay.
[20:09.58]It looks like we've done... Oh, no.
[20:12.75]Hold on.
[20:12.95]Is that clear?
[20:15.69]Is that clear?
[20:17.11]I think we've cleared most of it.
[20:19.27]Is there another stairwell?
[20:20.51]Access to next floor is down here.
[20:22.95]I'm going to draw.
[20:25.54]Follow the red line.
[20:27.14]The double red line.
[20:29.54]Alright, I'll draw.
[20:30.18]Here you go.
[20:32.49]Right here?
[20:33.79]Oh, there's another hostage here.
[20:35.57]Yeah, I brought him here.
[20:37.05]I don't know what we do with him.
[20:40.31]I was making a big circle on the map to make sure people could see it.
[20:49.14]Is it a time for another coffee?
[20:52.86]Poke.
[20:53.92]We're at the bottom.
[20:54.72]Poke.
[20:55.63]I'm bringing all the hostages.
[20:58.01]Probably not a bad idea.
[21:03.14]Stop.
[21:06.54]Do we bring them down with us or?
[21:09.09]You guys go clear it.
[21:10.07]I'll wait here and then I'll bring it down.
[21:13.18]I think there were even more than that.
[21:15.04]Alright, this floor... Oh dude, this floor is fucking hard, dude.
[21:18.03]This is where it gets real.
[21:20.01]Have you played this before?
[21:21.35]No.
[21:22.19]Oh.
[21:22.43]Okay.
[21:22.87]I don't see...
[21:23.82]Nothing on the...
[21:24.60]I think I should probably...
[21:25.66]I'm going to throw a flash in here.
[21:28.76]Shite.
[21:29.84]And who... Ster.
[21:30.76]So you ready?
[21:31.24]I'm going to throw the flash in and then you breach and then just go do what you need to do.
[21:36.41]Mm-hmm.
[21:39.75]Breach it.
[21:41.96]Nice job.
[21:42.24]Clear.
[21:42.94]Clear.
[21:45.60]okay oh okay we got a guy with the rifle right there you want you want to do this play again yep I think it's too late I think oh man what happened uh one of us went off like lone wolf style and died I wonder who could have been with me
[22:11.22]Okay.
[22:12.30]I don't know if this should be like... You're limit testing.
[22:14.86]You're walking around like a fucking bunch of Pikmin.
[22:17.49]I don't know if we should be doing... We shouldn't be doing Pikmin right now because it's going to be like...
[22:22.35]They're all going to fucking die.
[22:23.47]I think we leave them.
[22:24.10]Keep them here.
[22:24.96]Keep them here.
[22:33.97]Clear!
[22:35.65]Oh.
[22:36.77]Thanks, man.
[22:40.16]The money's on the table.
[22:41.26]Watch out!
[22:44.74]Blast.
[22:47.27]He's dead.
[22:49.41]Alright, dude.
[22:49.75]He's dead.
[22:50.23]$100,000 on here.
[22:52.76]Oh, we did it.
[22:55.66]Nice.
[22:57.48]Fail, but we did... We did okay.
[23:02.07]Players down to six.
[23:03.98]There's only four of us.
[23:06.85]We did alright for our first one.
[23:08.73]There was new equipment too, so I guess you can equip up.
[23:14.52]I am not trusted with a grenade.
[23:16.76]Do not let me have that.
[23:19.28]Sidearm.
[23:21.26]Oh, you can do like a taser?
[23:28.85]We should do non-lethal.
[23:30.03]All of us non-lethal.
[23:31.35]You'd probably get more points.
[23:34.76]Heartbeat detector?
[23:39.83]Please trust.
[23:40.67]Whoa, my God.
[23:43.91]What the fuck?

[29:46.85]You don't let anyone else get the cranberries?
[29:51.75]You know what?
[29:52.53]It's going to be unpopular.
[29:53.71]I'm not a fan of the cranberries on Thanksgiving.
[29:57.50]Oh.
[29:58.56]Me neither.
[29:59.00]No, that could be a problem.
[30:01.04]Dude, I'm the guy that goes up there and the plate is so full.
[30:04.51]There's turkey on top of mashed potatoes.
[30:06.43]There's nowhere for anything to go.
[30:07.97]I've got like a pound of turkey on that plate.
[30:10.55]And I look to the person next to me that's also there at Thanksgiving.
[30:13.84]This is a flash from you teleporting through.
[30:15.58]I say, wow, really running out of real estate on this plate.
[30:19.34]Flash out.

[35:12.34]The VIP should stay here for a second.
[35:19.08]I think we're clear.
[35:22.23]We're good.
[35:23.93]Alright, bring the VIP down.
[35:28.63]Where am I?

[35:38.04]I thought that was you, Poke.
[35:42.41]I thought you were trying to kill me.
[35:49.45]Poke, I thought you turned the corner and just started shooting at me.
[35:54.74]I have a shield.
[35:56.84]This game's... Alright.
[35:59.26]Wait, there was three civilians?
[36:02.19]Didn't tell us that.
[36:02.99]We might have killed them.
[36:04.05]I threw a grenade in one of the rooms.
[36:09.99]game's cool is that code word for let's play lego party or what it needs work hey let me just tell you guys I'm happy I'm just having fun with y'all I'm having fun no matter what we do I don't care what it is wow I am abstain from voting but if I were light sticks if I had to pick
[36:38.52]I'm thinking either a ranch simulator scenario or a Lego party scenario.
[36:43.35]If I had to pick, but I'm abstaining.
[36:46.52]Alright.
[36:47.32]Ranch scenario.
[36:49.28]Do we want to do another mission or just jump over to ranch?
[36:53.59]I was actually kidding.
[36:55.09]We can do whatever.
[36:58.17]Well, now the vibes.
[37:00.03]No, I want to take a temperature check because I like this.
[37:02.21]I would do another mission, but I'm down for ranching.
[37:05.43]Let's do another mission.
[37:06.46]I think we just got into the game.
[37:07.52]I think we just got to the good part.
[37:10.00]Alright.
[37:10.30]Are you sure?
[37:13.38]One more mission and we'll see how it goes.
[37:15.51]Yeah, we'll see how we feel.
[37:16.49]Temperature check after that.
[37:18.07]Yeah.
[37:26.56]Taking the shotgun.
[37:28.03]Gosh, you guys.
[37:30.00]I'm also taking the shotgun.

[37:32.50]You know, I'll take a... Oh, you have a health dispenser still?
[37:38.24]Yeah, I'll bring health.
[37:40.79]Do not kill armored enemy.
[37:42.59]Do not destroy any art piece.
[37:45.19]Extract three hostage.
[37:47.85]Okay.
[37:50.74]This mission depends on tactical precision, restraint, and coordination.
[37:55.20]We're fucked.
[37:56.14]So, shotgun...
[37:59.02]uh maybe I won't bring a shotgun then shotgun seems strong it seems really strong yeah but we're gonna destroy those paintings like guaranteed wait how do we start where's the start zone again I think you have to do it did I not select the mission I'm just gonna go be ready I'm gonna be a ready randall
[38:34.08]I can go pro in this game.
[38:37.03]Can you?
[38:38.69]I feel like I could.
[38:39.81]You got the battlefield brain.
[38:42.89]I liked it.
[38:43.45]Did you like the Brooklyn mission?
[38:46.90]I didn't do the campaign at all.
[38:48.84]No, I mean the map.
[38:50.12]The Brooklyn map.

[39:33.75]Stupid fucking thing.
[39:35.77]Christopher.
[39:38.98]Christopher, what are you doing, Christopher?
[39:42.41]Have a seat.
[39:45.90]Did you see that YouTube poop, sir?
[39:48.05]The one where they're doing the intervention with Christopher and they keep telling him to have a seat and Pauly punches him in the face like 20 times?
[39:55.87]No, I have not seen this.
[39:57.74]Almost shot that hostage.
[39:58.58]I would like to.
[39:59.44]We're good.

[40:07.89]Alright, Polk and I have secured the top right of the facility.
[40:14.11]We're good.
[40:19.11]Good job.
[40:19.75]Good work.
[40:27.21]There's probably art in here.
[40:29.25]That looks like expensive art.
[40:31.83]What is this?
[40:32.35]Sidearm.
[40:33.40]I think that's expensive art.
[40:34.42]Guys, guys, guys.
[40:35.14]Don't go in.
[40:35.80]I have a heartbeat detector.
[40:36.94]There's guys in here.
[40:37.90]I'm drawing some...
[40:39.14]There's like four guys.
[40:41.05]Do you guys want to have a gamer moment?
[40:43.01]We all time these door opens?
[40:44.83]We're on opposite sides of the map.
[40:47.06]Oh.

[40:48.98]Oh, I just shot the hostage in the head.
[40:50.40]Never mind.
[40:52.51]I'm just trying to save him.
[40:53.47]We can save the hostage.
[40:56.17]Guys, run in this room and save the hostage.
[40:58.37]Save the hostage!

[41:10.33]Oh.
[41:11.53]Yeah, I might have shot him in the head by accident.
[41:15.32]Oh.
[41:16.98]Alright.
[41:17.64]That was, that was fun though.
[41:18.96]That was like a tough one.
[41:21.58]Alright, let's do it again.
[41:22.20]One more shot and we'll ranch it up, maybe.
[41:24.46]Or Lego it up.
[41:25.20]I know, you know, my audience loves Legos.
[41:27.33]So I want, at some point tonight, I'd love to do that.
[41:32.13]Shot him up!
[41:32.75]I feel like, I feel like we're going to really like Lego.
[41:36.23]I'm so sorry for having you guys play something else.
[41:38.54]We can just close it now.
[41:40.82]No, it's, this is chill.
[41:41.98]I like this game.
[41:42.68]I like that we're trying.
[41:43.72]We've been talking about Lego Party the whole time.
[41:47.00]It's fine.
[41:47.58]It's just the art.
[41:48.48]Sure, the game just didn't hit that hard.
[41:50.78]But you're the best for trying.
[41:54.11]So we can move on if that's the vibe.
[41:56.59]No, no, no.
[41:57.11]The vibe is good.
[41:58.13]The vibes?
[41:58.61]I'm having it.
[41:59.92]I love the vibe.
[42:00.94]I've got ninjas!

[42:11.65]I'm down.
[42:16.21]I used two of my eels.
[42:18.87]Oh, the hostage just...
[42:27.80]Okay, we know where they are now.
[42:29.97]Alright, we need to do some drawing here.
[42:31.43]We gotta get this completely situated.
[42:34.53]Okay.
[42:35.51]All of us are gonna go in this room here.
[42:37.52]There's a couple people in here.

[43:03.52]Oh, well, we did.
[43:04.74]You have to like, yeah, like stun them or something, I guess.
[43:08.79]Just not go in that room.

[43:39.84]According to this, this is good, but I will tell you there's like five people in here.
[43:45.91]Okay.
[43:48.09]So let's see if we can get a snipe situation maybe a little bit.
[43:51.18]Maybe with one of the sidearms.
[43:54.42]Someone flash on the top and I'll flash on the bottom.
[43:56.98]Alright, I'm going to flash the top.
[43:59.91]I'm ready to throw it in.
[44:01.75]Ready?
[44:02.73]3, 2, 1, going in.
[44:10.98]I'm...
[44:13.04]I'm dead.
[44:14.26]I had my flash still equipped.
[44:22.57]I was trying to shoot, but he was cocking the...
[44:25.17]I got the hostage.
[44:26.11]Hostage is alright.
[44:28.11]Okay, one more hostage.
[44:32.02]Guys, let me check the heartbeat.
[44:33.34]Let me check the heartbeat.
[44:36.40]Flash didn't go in?
[44:37.00]I don't detect any heartbeats in here.
[44:38.34]I'm still gonna flash though.
[44:40.76]Oh, this door's locked.
[44:42.16]Good.
[44:46.31]Checking the heartbeat.
[44:50.21]Player.
[44:52.07]Player, dude.
[44:52.56]We have other players invading.
[44:55.64]Okay, so who's left?
[44:58.22]I think this top left area.
[44:59.22]Okay, this top left area is where there's a million people in there.
[45:02.31]And there's a hostage in this room at the top left.
[45:03.91]We've got to plan that one big.
[45:07.71]Alright.
[45:07.91]I'm going to flash down this hall.
[45:14.97]Okay.
[45:16.07]Over here.
[45:16.81]Alright, Polk.
[45:20.47]We got a lot of people in this room.
[45:21.94]There's a guy right there at the tail end.
[45:23.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[45:24.04]Let's do it together.
[45:24.70]Let's do it together.
[45:25.34]I'm going to jump in.
[45:26.32]I'm going to jump in.
[45:26.76]Oh, they're coming out.
[45:27.24]They're coming out.
[45:27.84]They're coming out.
[45:28.26]They're coming out.
[45:31.91]I'm hopping in real quick.
[45:32.49]I'm hopping in.
[45:32.81]Oh, it's a good... Oh, God.
[45:33.43]We're flashing.
[45:34.27]Flashing.
[45:36.82]Flash.
[45:38.98]He splashed.
[45:43.00]Alright.
[45:43.25]Flash.
[45:43.49]Flash.
[45:46.35]Double flash.
[45:48.92]Did we hit the hostage in the head with the flashbang?
[45:54.98]No, I don't know.
[45:58.05]Maybe when they hear us coming, they shoot him and he's like already dying by the time we walk up.
[46:04.15]That's weird.
[46:06.44]We got to be way quieter.
[46:08.52]I think maybe shotguns.
[46:09.54]Let's start with the top one.
[46:11.70]That one seems to be the one that's given us the most problems.
[46:13.69]So let's try that.
[46:17.08]Yeah, let's do that.
[46:18.48]That's got like 10 people in it.
[46:19.67]Maybe we should restart.
[46:21.59]Someone took over my PC.
[46:24.87]I don't know if there is a restart.
[46:26.89]Are we going to die?
[46:28.74]Or go kill a hostage real quick?
[46:31.00]Okay.
[46:31.60]No.
[46:33.14]No, we're good.
[46:33.56]We're good.
[46:39.39]Someone over there.
[46:40.41]Someone over there to the left.

[49:29.21]Just no communication.
[49:31.09]Just fucking grenades, flashbangs.
[49:34.25]This is, I guess, how we do.
[49:38.82]Until we win.
[49:40.76]This is like a battlefield lobby.
[49:42.38]It's just like fucking flashbangs everywhere, explosions.
[49:46.74]Heartbeat detector has detected.
[49:50.40]Okay, he's dead.
