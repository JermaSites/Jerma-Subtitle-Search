[00:43.88]secret stream well I'm hitting you with the uh I'm hitting you with the extreme reverse delay this is extreme the sus said Thursday it's Tuesday what an extreme reverse delay
[01:14.80]Anyways, how are you?
[01:15.50]Hope you're having a good day.
[01:19.08]So is there no stream on Thursday?
[01:21.10]Um, there probably still will be.
[01:24.58]I don't know.
[01:24.84]It depends.
[01:29.84]Does the music sound weird?
[01:33.31]Shouldn't.
[01:35.41]Surprise stream?
[01:37.41]Yeah, technically.
[01:47.83]Does the music taste weird?
[01:49.27]If you're curious why I turned the stream on, I'm just going to play a game and chill.
[02:00.68]I think I talked a little bit about a few weeks ago as we went into 2023.
[02:04.68]I want to do much more stuff like this.
[02:09.42]But we're just chilling.
[02:11.66]Doesn't need to be anything crazy going on.
[02:13.34]Doesn't need to be anything elaborate.
[02:14.72]I'm just going to play Plants vs. Zombies and hang out.
[02:17.28]I think there were a lot of people over the last year or two that have been like, you know, I really miss when he just fucking relaxed and played Plants vs. Zombies.
[02:28.21]I feel like a lot of people have had that opinion.
[02:32.50]And I join your opinion.
[02:35.18]I think I kind of missed being able to just chill and hang out and just do whatever.
[02:40.98]So they're coming back.
[02:43.99]I promise there won't be any McDonald's rants tonight.
[02:46.81]Well, I can't promise that.
[02:50.29]But, you know.
[02:51.17]How long are you going to go for?
[02:56.13]I think that's the other thing too.
[02:59.71]No time limit.
[03:01.07]No kind of rhyme or reason to anything here.
[03:04.49]Just going to play a game, hang out, talk.
[03:12.13]This is going to be 15 hours?
[03:14.01]No.
[03:16.67]I don't think I'll ever go over 14.
[03:21.94]Also, too, there's not going to be a cam tonight.
[03:24.36]I'm going to try some, go back to kind of the way, if you don't know, back before 2020.
[03:31.58]2021, 2020.
[03:32.94]I never did facecam.
[03:35.45]It was something that was very rare.
[03:41.29]So we're going to be doing less facecam.
[03:44.75]But no, it's not going away.
[03:45.89]Let me be really upfront.
[03:47.29]People be like, wait a minute.
[03:48.39]Why is he taking the facecam off permanently?
[03:51.27]No, it's just when I feel like hanging out and chilling, it's not going to be on.
[03:56.03]That's right.
[03:56.65]I get to be naked again.
[03:58.47]It's awesome.
[04:00.14]You know how long?
[04:00.98]Don't.
[04:01.30]I'm not going to rant about anything.
[04:02.80]This is a chill stream.
[04:07.32]I've been waiting for the opportunity.
[04:10.32]No, I'm just kidding.
[04:13.53]But yeah, well, I don't really have a plan.
[04:15.77]The plan was, uh, I was in offline chat just kind of hanging out for a minute and gave a few options.
[04:21.88]Like, let's just play Plants vs. Zombies.
[04:23.02]I don't think I ever beat this game.
[04:29.58]Maybe we'll beat it tonight.
[04:30.36]I don't know.
[04:32.95]Maybe I'll play for an hour.
[04:34.23]Maybe I'll play for four hours.
[04:36.03]Maybe I'll be here all night.
[04:38.49]But let's just relax and have some, uh, have some fun.
[04:44.41]Breath of the Wild.
[04:44.95]Breath of the Wild is going to.
[04:47.97]It's going to be funny because.
[04:49.07]So the first like six Breath of the Wild streams.
[04:54.23]Were there's a lot going on.
[04:56.09]It's like the second part of the Breath of the Wild series is going to be so much more like chilled out and kind of turned down a lot, right?
[05:04.22]You're going to get to the second half and be like, wow, he must have really what the fuck happened to him.
[05:15.32]But anyways, yeah, let's open it up.
[05:16.92]Hope you guys are doing well.
[05:19.36]I know this is going to be new for a lot of you.
[05:22.54]But it's something I wanted to do this year.
[05:25.56]Spend a lot more time just doing stuff like this.
[05:30.14]Let's go.
[05:30.46]Is there anything weird that I need to do?
[05:34.94]With Clans vs. Zombies?
[05:36.30]It's been so long.
[05:37.16]Do I have the... Is this the right version?
[05:42.10]Did I get the wrong version?
[05:44.94]Are you on your iPad?
[05:45.56]That would actually be kind of funny.
[05:50.56]Fuck, this looks old.
[05:52.65]Well, that's because it is old.
[05:55.45]It is very old.
[05:58.43]When did Plants vs. Zombies come out?
[06:00.79]I don't remember.
[06:02.95]Make your own zombie?
[06:04.17]What does this mean?
[06:04.69]I don't know what this means.
[06:09.50]Make your own zombie.
[06:10.44]I clicked on this and it was like, I had to agree to terms here.
[06:15.23]What's this?
[06:17.41]I had this on my family PC.
[06:19.36]Yeah.
[06:23.86]Fix the aspect ratio?
[06:26.30]I don't think that's possible.
[06:30.74]Wait, so I can make a zombie?
[06:33.98]Is this what they look like when they come down the lanes?
[06:42.91]Oh, okay.
[06:43.27]Okay.
[06:45.08]Do I have to unlock these, or are they just all available?
[06:52.79]Um, okay.
[06:58.57]Just the first zombie with the flag.
[07:00.31]Oh, okay.
[07:01.77]Cool.
[07:04.75]Hmm.
[07:10.28]Aw, dude, look at this.
[07:11.10]Look at this character creator.
[07:15.24]I like that.
[07:18.72]Use plenty of sunflowers.
[07:20.58]I used to be pretty damn good at this game.
[07:24.08]I don't think I ever beat it.
[07:25.14]How long is the campaign?
[07:28.94]Oh, definitely that.
[07:34.51]Yep.
[07:37.83]It's like 30 hours.
[07:41.63]You could probably finish it in one sitting.
[07:43.79]30 hours, I don't think.
[07:44.89]One sitting, that's a long time.
[07:47.05]That sounds like a while.
[07:51.07]Hold on, let me move my chair.
[07:53.51]I got a pretty good tea here, too.
[07:58.83]Here we go.
[08:03.25]Here we go.
[08:05.35]Okay.
[08:08.05]Okay.
[08:08.28]Okay.
[08:10.86]Sorry.
[08:13.35]Oh no, I put my cord underneath it.
[08:14.67]What are you doing?
[08:20.43]I'm moving my chair.
[08:24.09]Yeah, people are asking, no cam tonight.
[08:27.81]This is a relaxed night.
[08:30.39]What should I be wearing?
[08:34.09]Oh, I got an orange spiced tea, by the way.
[08:38.89]Ooh.
[08:39.11]It's very smooth.
[08:43.15]Clown costume.
[08:49.14]This song is comfy.
[08:50.20]Yeah.
[08:54.26]I'll do the clown.
[08:59.68]Oh, these are teeth.
[09:00.52]Okay.
[09:03.57]White collar.
[09:05.23]Gold teeth, I think.
[09:06.11]Play insane aquarium.
[09:11.73]I think I did a long time ago.
[09:16.75]Remember, this is pre-recorded.
[09:20.17]You might think that.
[09:21.45]It says probably feel that way.
[09:24.81]What do we got here?
[09:25.45]Gold teeth.
[09:26.07]Okay.
[09:29.24]It's an AI generated stream.
[09:31.22]I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice.
[09:33.32]It's an AI generated stream.
[09:38.50]I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice.
[09:43.51]It's an AI-generated stream.
[09:45.03]I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice.
[09:46.86]I'm thinking this.
[09:58.12]I like the gold teeth.
[09:59.12]I'll stay gold.
[10:08.07]Hey, just because I'm relaxing doesn't mean I'm not going to be weird.
[10:12.31]Come on.
[10:17.23]Oh, that's right.
[10:19.21]Somebody said this too.
[10:20.73]The last time I played this game, it was, I couldn't beat the tutorial during the Halloween special from a few years ago.
[10:32.22]That's right.
[10:34.44]It's just, there was no attention there at all.
[10:36.64]Zero.
[10:38.40]Zero attention.
[10:41.79]So, let's see if I can, uh, fix that.
[10:45.17]Let's see if we can actually beat the first level.
[10:46.93]That'd be great.
[10:47.55]I think this is fine.
[10:53.83]Be sure you're done creating your... Zompatar.
[10:58.75]If you wish to make any changes, you'll need to start over.
[11:01.85]So what?
[11:04.55]What?
[11:07.27]Your Zompatar has been saved to your desktop.
[11:09.69]Why did it do that?
[11:15.08]That's weird.
[11:16.28]That's weird.
[11:16.90]I don't like that.
[11:18.32]I really don't like that.
[11:19.80]Where is it?
[11:20.32]Hold on.
[11:20.74]Is it actually on my desktop?
[11:25.57]Yeah, it is.
[11:26.03]That's strange.
[11:33.09]Okay.
[11:35.19]Oh, yeah.
[11:35.49]I have to capture the... Sorry.
[11:37.96]The window needs to be captured.
[11:39.20]There you go.
[11:46.79]You can't capture this game as a game.
[11:48.17]It has to be a window.
[11:49.47]Alright, so there it is.
[11:50.31]Cool.
[11:50.57]Alright, let's go.
[11:57.68]Make that your Twitch avatar.
[12:06.71]Oh, this is a replay of the last game that I played.
[12:08.67]Look at that placement.
[12:14.39]Alright.
[12:15.89]I can't lose the tutorial?
[12:17.01]I mean, there's no way, right?
[12:19.79]How did I lose the tutorial?
[12:21.17]I should probably turn it up, shouldn't I?
[12:26.66]No, I'm like actually genuinely asking, how did I lose the tutorial?
[12:30.90]You can't.
[12:34.90]There we go.
[12:35.22]Is that better?
[12:35.64]Okay, you put it back here.
[12:39.15]And you always want to have the sunflowers in the back row.
[12:41.07]You might remember.
[12:41.91]Okay.
[12:45.32]Did I actually lose on this level?
[12:46.80]I cannot believe that.
[12:48.28]It seems impossible.
[12:54.41]It was this screen?
[13:03.47]You lost to one lane.
[13:04.89]How?
[13:06.09]Because you can't.
[13:12.94]I forget how cool this game was.
[13:15.32]I forget how awesome this game was, and I forget just how much I was so sad when the second one came out.
[13:25.50]It's too loud.
[13:32.32]How's that?
[13:32.58]Is that better?
[13:34.32]How is that still too loud?
[13:36.81]Come on, dude.
[13:38.97]There we go.
[13:44.00]Play the YouTube video of you ranting about the in-game currency.
[13:47.90]The one thing that I remember about Plants vs. Zombies 2 was that.
[13:50.19]It was the fact that some levels, it was just like, oh yeah, there's like electricity lightning moves.
[13:57.43]You just put your finger over it and you just destroy every single enemy on the screen.
[14:01.09]And it was, it cost money to do it.
[14:04.47]There we go.
[14:05.11]It's Sunflower.
[14:12.13]Make the music and the sound effects the same volume.
[14:14.99]Okay.
[14:17.91]We gotta get the perfect... It's gotta be chill.
[14:20.90]This is not chill.
[14:22.56]This is chill.
[14:23.28]This is not chill.
[14:24.16]I think it's in a good spot.
[14:28.36]Alright, yeah, the sunflowers are going back row.
[14:31.44]You guys gotta help me with decisions, though.
[14:34.06]Because I know that eventually you can buy things.
[14:37.02]You guys probably know a lot more than I do.
[14:47.53]Yeah, this feels pretty nice, doesn't it?
[14:53.77]There are a lot of people that probably think this is a joke, like, ah, ah, no, I like this, this is cool.
[15:03.84]So I used to do double Sunflower, right?
[15:07.64]It's like kind of overkill, but I used to like it.
[15:09.89]It was like, yeah, give me the double the power.
[15:17.80]Some people are against the double sunflower lane, but I always wanted extra power.
[15:28.49]I'm probably going to continue to do double sunflower.
[15:30.13]Hey, when is the bit going to end?
[15:35.77]Oh, shit.
[15:36.31]Yeah, a screamer is going to show up in about one to two minutes, I think.
[15:40.94]I have it programmed so that a screamer just goes right in the middle of the screen.
[15:50.12]How pissed would some of you be if that happened and the stream turned off?
[15:53.70]I feel like a lot of people would be really mad at me.
[16:01.96]Do three rows of sunflowers?
[16:03.48]Nah, now you're just asking too much.
[16:15.19]Can you ever make the cooldown faster on these?
[16:16.87]I don't think so, right?
[16:23.58]This is a chill grandpa stream.
[16:25.85]Yeah.
[16:26.67]That's what I like to hear.
[16:34.09]Best gamer moment.
[16:35.03]Beating the tutorial.
[16:38.75]Oh, look.
[16:39.39]There's our guy.
[16:42.49]Dude, he was so cool.
[16:43.55]I don't have to do anything else.
[16:54.88]Ooh, I remember this.
[17:01.17]I support grandfathers across America.
[17:05.63]So is this a lane or is this just the air, like just a small area?
[17:08.89]I forgot.
[17:09.99]No, the chili pepper is the lane, right?
[17:12.46]From what I remember.
[17:15.54]And why does this game have a 3D acceleration option?
[17:17.94]What does that do?
[17:24.91]a three by three square so like oh all I remember about this is at every convention there were those cones were on everybody's head if you went to a gaming convention between like 2000 like 11 to like 2014 it was like that was that was like a fashion statement wearing one of these cones
[17:54.28]I feel like you're lying.
[17:55.24]No?
[17:59.02]No, I'm going double.
[17:59.76]I gotta go double row.
[18:00.76]Come on.
[18:01.08]I feel like you've said that before.
[18:04.18]Ah, probably.
[18:16.91]Double row?
[18:23.37]Look out for that zombie.
[18:24.25]I got plenty of time, don't worry.
[18:30.64]If Jerma doesn't respond to this, then it's pre-recorded.
[18:40.24]Well, how do you know that I didn't make sure I specifically addressed comments like yours?
[18:44.92]In the pre-recorded video.
[18:49.44]Look out.
[18:49.90]What?
[18:53.26]Got it.
[18:59.54]Actually, it might be kind of funny if I just respond to stuff that's not there.
[19:02.53]Yeah, maybe I'll do that for a minute or so.
[19:13.05]What's my favorite kind of steak?
[19:14.89]I'm not really a huge steak guy.
[19:18.12]But I like kind of a medium, medium well.
[19:20.86]Just like a flat kind of iron steak.
[19:37.18]Come on.
[19:38.54]I can't get... I cannot have any of my flowers get touched once in the first zone.
[19:46.46]That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it?
[20:00.60]You making up stuff?
[20:03.08]Uh, hold on.
[20:05.89]Is there pizza?
[20:07.51]Standard pepperoni is pretty much how I like to eat my pizza.
[20:13.95]I fucked it up.
[20:15.35]I fucked it up.
[20:15.83]I'm gonna lose.
[20:22.29]Type mustache.
[20:25.13]Is that a cheat code or something?
[20:27.73]Look at that placement.
[20:28.49]Awful.
[20:30.35]Is it gonna give me unlimited money?
[20:31.63]I'm not gonna do that.
[20:38.28]I wonder how... This game gets actually kind of difficult, doesn't it?
[20:54.55]It gives the zombies mustaches.
[20:55.89]Hmm.
[21:08.22]Technically, yes.
[21:10.10]Does it add money or anything?
[21:12.20]I don't want to... Hold on.
[21:13.20]No, no, no.
[21:13.70]Why am I doing that?
[21:14.27]Save that.
[21:25.93]I always want to get a row down first.
[21:31.22]I'm going to do double row until I can't.
[21:43.99]That's the screamer code.
[21:47.41]You type mustache and it just goes.
[21:59.50]Don't you dare.
[22:01.42]Good.
[22:01.66]Okay.
[22:14.82]I always want to make sure there's at least one person in each row.
[22:18.23]Please type mustache.
[22:19.29]No.
[22:19.83]No.
[22:20.33]No.
[22:25.27]Would I rather eat a burger or a pizza?
[22:29.26]I think that's an impossible question.
[22:32.38]Because there are some days where you really feel like a pizza, and there are some days where you really don't feel like a pizza.
[22:49.41]I think honestly though, if I had to delete one of them, if I had to delete pizza or delete burgers from Earth, they were just gone.
[22:59.16]They were just Thanos snapped out.
[23:03.22]I don't know.
[23:08.55]What do I care about more?
[23:11.17]Do I like pizza more than hamburgers?
[23:17.03]I probably, oh, that's hard.
[23:24.63]Pizza is better.
[23:25.21]Pizza is better than burgers.
[23:26.35]I would probably say pizza probably is better than burgers in most cases.
[23:31.08]But if I feel like a burger, like if I really feel like a burger, I don't think it can match like the taste of a burger.
[23:40.95]Pizza is very versatile.
[23:42.09]Burgers are versatile too, but I feel like there's a lot you can do with a pizza.
[23:55.93]If you delete burgers, the BS won't exist anymore.
[23:58.11]I think they could eat pizza.
[24:02.85]They would be happy with that.
[24:04.00]Oh, hold on a minute.
[24:06.50]Am I deleting like beef?
[24:10.42]Or just like how you make a burger?
[24:13.16]Like the bun, the cheese, the patty.
[24:15.56]Am I deleting beef?
[24:18.18]Because I would not do that.
[24:19.50]I don't think I would do that.
[24:28.18]No, just burgers.
[24:31.70]I think I can live with that, though.
[24:37.38]Deleting beef.
[24:38.44]Yeah.
[24:40.60]What difficulty are you on?
[24:41.58]I don't think there are other difficulties in this game.
[24:43.68]Oh!
[24:43.78]There he is!
[24:44.10]Crazy Dave!
[24:45.24]Oh!
[24:55.99]I need you to clear your lawn.
[24:57.57]Use your shovel to dig up those plants.
[24:59.43]Okay.
[25:04.36]What purpose is this to serve again?
[25:08.14]Do an impression?
[25:08.86]Okay.
[25:09.50]I'm not doing that one.
[25:13.08]I'm not doing that one either, but here you go.
[25:21.27]There's a chill stream.
[25:22.01]There's gonna be weird voices.
[25:23.15]Hey!
[25:25.02]That's not what I said.
[25:26.02]Oh, right.
[25:32.26]I remember now.
[25:35.64]Oh, wait.
[25:36.22]Is this... Oh!
[25:37.88]Wait a minute.
[25:38.48]That's right.
[25:40.26]Okay.
[25:41.12]Was this explode or not?
[25:47.28]Right.
[25:47.50]Okay.
[25:47.72]I remember.
[25:52.33]It's kind of like a puzzle.
[26:03.52]How's the music this good?
[26:05.87]All these old PopCap games were... I don't even know what happened.
[26:17.28]PopCap made banger after banger after banger.
[26:21.73]O.E.A.
[26:23.19]Get that sometimes.
[26:31.66]Don't let any through.
[26:32.74]I don't think any will get through.
[26:41.03]I have a really important question, though.
[26:42.31]What actually happened to PopCap?
[26:44.15]Are they still doing anything?
[26:46.39]I mean, Peggle 2 was the last... God, that had to have been at least five plus years ago, wasn't it?
[26:59.19]It was all mobile.
[27:01.38]Uh-oh.
[27:02.44]Uh-oh.
[27:04.44]Uh-oh.
[27:06.02]I actually might be in trouble.
[27:09.42]Yeah, they got bought by EA.
[27:25.51]Oh, the Garden Warfare games.
[27:27.01]That's right.
[27:30.89]You know, I actually heard those games were pretty fun.
[27:32.81]They are.
[27:42.96]Play them.
[27:45.40]But I actually like them.
[27:46.30]I feel like that's the kind of multiplayer first person or third person shooter type game that I probably really actually would like.
[27:55.24]There's a couple of them, right?
[27:56.02]There's a Garden Warfare, Garden Warfare 2, Garden Warfare, uh, Neighborhood or something.
[28:01.22]Isn't there like a few of them?
[28:07.54]It's very similar to TF2.
[28:08.50]Really?
[28:08.68]Hmm.
[28:18.89]Sure, but you would be assed at bowling.
[28:25.14]Let me be really, really honest with you, though.
[28:28.20]Be real, and I want you to be honest.
[28:30.40]How many of you... How many of you... One's in the chat if you actually can reliably get a strike in bowling.
[28:40.03]I don't think it's anybody.
[28:40.93]I don't think anybody does.
[28:44.67]No, you cannot.
[28:45.69]Come on.
[28:51.72]And I'm not talking about just a strike.
[28:53.30]I'm talking about like... And it curves across the whole lane.
[28:57.69]And boom!
[28:58.87]Blows up all the pins.
[28:59.69]And you can do that more than once or twice in a row.
[29:04.61]Uh-oh.
[29:06.87]I don't believe you.
[29:15.47]I can bowl a 60?
[29:16.09]Is that good?
[29:21.03]Whoa.
[29:24.83]Look at how big that is.
[29:28.49]You can tell the resolution is really small just because of how huge that was.
[29:33.72]That was gigantic.
[29:47.07]That might have been weird placement, but I think it was good.
[29:50.21]Max is 300.
[30:05.27]What about mashed potatoes versus mac and cheese?
[30:09.65]Mac and cheese gets to stay.
[30:13.73]Oh shit.
[30:15.03]Uh oh.
[30:16.15]Hold on.
[30:16.49]I have to panic here.
[30:17.73]Because they can jump over these things, right?
[30:24.38]Can they jump over these?
[30:31.04]You can jump over those.
[30:32.52]Uh oh.
[30:39.84]Don't you dare.
[30:41.66]Don't.
[30:42.40]I have to go flawless.
[30:43.42]Come on.
[30:46.34]No.
[30:46.66]No.
[30:46.86]You have to.
[30:47.28]I have to be flawless.
[30:49.34]No.
[30:49.70]No.
[30:52.42]No.
[30:52.74]Uh oh.
[30:54.73]This is actually kind of bad.
[30:58.35]No.
[30:58.45]Stop eating that.
[31:00.25]No.
[31:00.45]I gotta get it.
[31:01.51]I gotta get it right.
[31:02.71]I can't have a lot more happen right now.
[31:05.27]Oh my god.
[31:05.95]What do I do?
[31:20.38]Oh, he can only jump once.
[31:21.22]Alright, okay.
[31:25.56]Why can you panic so easily?
[31:26.70]I don't know.
[31:27.52]Alright, you're going to jump that.
[31:32.95]No, good luck.
[31:33.51]You're not going to make it faster.
[31:40.63]I got double... Yeah, there we go.
[31:53.04]Alright, we're good.
[31:56.29]Everything has the right amount.
[31:58.19]I have my explosion.
[31:59.07]I'm going to use it probably over here.
[32:00.23]I'm going to use it right here.
[32:09.19]We're good?
[32:10.01]Okay, we're fine.
[32:13.49]He's still doing the Elden Ring stuff on the weekend?
[32:15.27]Oh yeah, 100%.
[32:23.88]Bro does not have a green thumb.
[32:27.37]I was actually, uh... So, Ster's playing Nioh 2 right now.
[32:33.87]And I just was catching a little bit of it.
[32:35.91]And I was laughing because somebody in his chat said... What was it?
[32:40.04]It was like... Dude, you're gonna do so good.
[32:43.14]You're gonna... It was like a little paragraph.
[32:45.02]It was just... Oh, hey man, don't worry.
[32:47.20]You're gonna learn this game and you're gonna make it rain on these enemies and do it like a boss.
[32:52.18]It was... I just loved it.
[32:53.74]It was so funny.
[32:56.43]It was like... It was like one of my favorite comments.
[33:00.67]Dude, you're gonna make it rain.
[33:03.35]Like a bot.
[33:04.11]It was like all the little taglines from that stream, like in one comment.
[33:07.97]It was, I loved it.
[33:18.65]Alright.
[33:18.85]Maybe the strategy, wait.
[33:19.91]Ooh.
[33:20.05]Okay.
[33:22.23]I got to rethink my strategy.
[33:23.27]Okay.
[33:26.27]We're not going double lane, but we're going to do one row.
[33:30.37]I'm putting this here because I don't want to deal with this yet.
[33:36.25]It's like Jermis streaming from his alt account.
[33:41.42]I mean, honestly, I just kind of want to do more of these.
[33:44.24]Not every stream we got to be fucking crazy, you know what I mean?
[33:56.47]Do double lane?
[33:59.96]I'm going to leave the opportunity to.
[34:11.41]Does this dude do more damage than this?
[34:13.67]Because this is a slow, right?
[34:17.60]Yeah.
[34:18.22]Does it do more damage?
[34:25.54]Yeah, we used to do a lot of these.
[34:26.78]This was something, for the most part, the stream back in like 2016, 2017, 2018.
[34:31.96]There's a lot of stuff like this, and I really want to bring it back.
[34:43.94]Pottage.
[34:44.38]I do a second line.
[34:48.70]I don't think no.
[34:50.14]Yes.
[34:54.82]Come on, let's go.
[34:56.92]Did you do a flappy bird stream?
[34:58.16]Maybe I will.
[34:58.91]What are my thoughts on Greek yogurt?
[35:02.37]It's good.
[35:05.67]I will say I don't like plain Greek yogurt unless it's put in a smoothie or something, but.
[35:11.28]It's good.
[35:12.96]I like vanilla Greek yogurt.
[35:20.58]Okay, this is... I have to read this.
[35:32.74]Nobody goes.
[35:33.22]What are your thoughts on Greek politics?
[35:37.99]Yeah, let's transition to that.
[35:40.79]Let's talk about that now.
[35:43.03]Hey dude, what are your thoughts on Greek yogurt?
[35:44.69]What about Greek politics?
[35:57.92]How do you feel about ancient Greek?
[36:01.90]I wasn't there, so I don't know.
[36:09.38]I know, this is not aesthetically pleasing.
[36:11.73]They're not lined up correctly.
[36:14.97]They're haphazardly placed.
[36:16.35]I know.
[36:16.63]I can do better.
[36:19.45]Hmm.
[36:28.30]Every lane needs one of these.
[36:36.86]I wanted you to jump over that.
[36:38.18]Exactly what I wanted.
[36:39.16]Fell into my trap.
[36:41.28]Stupid.
[36:47.51]I don't think you can ever take this off.
[36:48.79]I really don't.
[36:49.93]I think it's way too important.
[37:03.88]Overpriced, though.
[37:07.74]I think 150 to be able to clear potentially a half dozen enemies.
[37:14.34]I think it's pretty good.
[37:17.60]It's also instant too.
[37:23.31]This makes me want to play Insane Aquarium.
[37:25.49]It really does.
[37:26.07]That game is so good.
[37:28.35]It's not even funny.
[37:43.15]What are your thoughts on wireless toilets?
[37:47.00]What does that mean?
[37:54.78]Like, you flush the toilet with your phone?
[38:01.63]I don't understand.
[38:05.33]What an extra step that doesn't need to be there.
[38:09.20]Oh, I gotta flush.
[38:09.86]Hold on.
[38:10.12]Let me open up the app.
[38:11.18]And then go to, like, wait for it to load and then touch flush on the app.
[38:14.76]I don't know.
[38:20.34]Sometimes, like, with the way that, like, tech is going, why do I feel like that that's something that would happen?
[38:27.63]Well, you don't understand.
[38:28.41]You see, it's on your phone.
[38:33.65]The Wi-Fi is out.
[38:34.53]I can't flush my toilet.
[38:52.30]This is why we hold on to this.
[38:54.83]Yep.
[38:58.55]You know what my favorite item in the game was?
[39:02.85]The triple shooter.
[39:13.10]Oh, this one eats people, right?
[39:14.64]It takes like a minute or so to chew them up.
[39:23.26]Garbage, don't use it.
[39:33.09]Why is my game lagging?
[39:36.41]Yeah, this seems like... You think this is expensive.
[39:38.39]This is way too expensive, I think.
[39:45.00]Yeah, I'm keeping the original crew here.
[39:50.40]Comber's good.
[39:57.03]Why can your PC not handle this?
[40:06.40]What's your favorite veggie?
[40:07.26]This is the first stream I've ever been to.
[40:09.62]That's actually a really important question to ask.
[40:13.10]Probably broccoli.
[40:21.70]Mayonnaise.
[40:22.30]Yeah, my favorite vegetable is mayonnaise.
[40:34.05]Broccoli's great.
[40:35.07]I actually... I like raw broccoli.
[40:39.59]I actually prefer raw broccoli to cooked.
[40:42.83]I like the snap.
[40:50.53]Or maybe very, very, like, steamed very slightly.
[40:59.62]Come on.
[41:01.10]Come on!
[41:02.12]Yes!
[41:09.14]I don't really like really cooked broccoli.
[41:10.82]It kind of falls apart.
[41:12.65]It turns into weird mush.
[41:15.15]Especially if it's, I don't know, I don't like mushy broccoli.
[41:17.91]I much prefer cooked broccoli.
[41:34.74]I like it just gently cooked.
[41:39.47]Alright, now we go blue.
[41:43.31]Let's prepare with, you know, put a nut here to prepare.
[41:58.82]It's kind of funny because I prefer raw carrots too.
[42:03.75]I prefer most of the vegetables raw.
[42:07.85]Carrots raw.
[42:09.70]Broccoli raw.
[42:10.96]What else?
[42:15.88]Radishes.
[42:16.84]Just kind of clean them up.
[42:18.42]Eat them.
[42:22.24]Yeah.
[42:30.27]Is it going to work out or what?
[42:31.43]I don't want to use this right now, but if I have to, I will.
[42:43.13]I'm actually not a... I don't really like potatoes.
[42:45.76]Have I talked about my kind of love-hate relationship with potatoes?
[42:55.98]A baked potato is not really that appetizing to me at all.
[43:10.27]That's an L take.
[43:12.07]Yeah, that's OK though.
[43:15.03]Alright, this is the big one.
[43:20.09]Whatever you say broccoli boy.
[43:21.59]Sorry.
[43:46.33]Ooh, this is the double shooter, isn't it?
[43:51.68]Risk it on a baked potato?
[44:00.32]That's an AI strategy?
[44:01.52]I don't think so.
[44:15.30]What the hell are you guys writing?
[44:16.20]What is this?
[44:20.91]Oh, it's a dream.
[44:21.91]Okay.
[44:22.27]I was like, what did I do?
[44:23.91]I was like, what happened?
[44:28.78]Something about this loading screen it doesn't like.
[44:30.96]Definitely this.
[44:31.70]And I'll tell you, people are going to be like, bro, settle down.
[44:35.16]This is a bad idea.
[44:36.10]We'll see.
[44:45.29]Is this the first loss of the evening?
[44:46.39]Is it a bad idea?
[45:06.94]We'll see.
[45:09.50]Each row has to have one of these.
[45:10.56]Uh-oh.
[45:12.84]Oh, this could have been a huge mistake.
[45:26.39]Pretty greedy.
[45:27.24]It is, but it's alright.
[45:38.35]So much greed, yeah.
[45:39.99]It's a lot of greed.
[45:45.59]I'm thinking about going even further with it.
[45:47.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[46:07.31]That'll pop up now, right?
[46:08.71]I'm in a good spot.
[46:20.88]For the love of God, Goddess Athena, please purchase a chomper.
[46:30.64]For the love of God.
[46:31.50]I love how you clarify.
[46:33.84]Goddess Athena.
[46:36.20]Just in case we weren't sure.
[46:38.30]Alright, good.
[46:52.41]I'm glad he's there.
[46:53.07]Alright, I've got my two rows.
[46:55.25]I'm good.
[46:57.05]I ain't fucking around there.
[47:18.87]You're gonna make it rain like a boss once you figure it out.
[47:23.97]We're doing fine.
[47:24.65]Everything's good.
[47:48.33]double shooter alright good we've got our base here now we go with the freeze I've got my wave one coming
[48:17.08]This is not gaming.
[48:17.92]You need to be sipping on a big gulp.
[48:20.10]True.
[48:25.38]Worth it.
[48:47.44]Look at all this is clean.
[49:09.55]Look at this.
[49:10.05]This is very nice.
[49:23.48]Wait, what?
[49:23.88]You just made this up?
[49:51.92]Hey, if you don't mind, could you please type mustache real quick?
[49:54.86]Yeah, let me type in mustache.
[50:03.63]No, don't do that.
[50:04.63]That'd be stupid.
[50:10.50]Nothing's getting by.
[50:30.52]Alright, I'm ready.
[50:31.02]Is anything missing?
[50:33.09]This row needs something, right?
[50:34.05]I'm going to wait for 200.
[50:40.42]Every row is protected.
[50:41.56]Every row is good to go.
[50:42.68]I've got all kinds of explosives everywhere.
[50:45.95]Everything is good.
[50:55.83]I'm gonna hold this.
[50:58.07]Um, wait.
[50:59.49]Wait.
[51:02.45]Ow.
[51:05.47]Nice.
[51:06.01]Nice.
[51:09.19]Easy.
[51:10.98]Simple.
[51:15.90]Alright, now that's essentially the tutorial.
[51:17.82]The tutorial's over.
[51:21.94]Hello.
[51:22.66]We're about to launch an all-out attack on your house.
[51:25.12]Sincerely, Zombie.
[51:35.36]No, it's another one of these.
[51:36.20]I actually am really not good at these levels, but I'll try.
[51:39.77]Let me assess the situation first.
[51:45.49]Okay.
[51:47.61]Okay, obviously.
[51:58.56]They just, they don't go off the screen, right?
[52:00.06]They just go stack.
[52:12.67]Every row needs something.
[52:25.85]Right.
[52:33.39]row this one right here have I ever used this thing oops sorry thank you goddess Athena
[53:16.88]Yeah, I got an orange spice.
[53:18.36]I might pick another one too.
[53:30.81]You play Hades?
[53:34.34]Yeah, I beat it once or twice, right?
[53:39.10]But I didn't really... That's like saying I beat Binding of Isaac because I killed Mom's heart once.
[53:44.84]Right?
[53:45.04]That's not accurate.
[53:47.62]But I did complete the game in quotes.
[53:58.89]Sorry, buddy.
[54:06.62]Play it fully then.
[54:08.36]Immediately.
[54:09.02]Alright, this is a victory.
[54:26.10]Play The Sims.
[54:29.98]I'll probably go back to it at some point.
[54:41.71]I almost have too much though.
[54:46.27]I've got three bombs there just waiting.
[54:54.26]How far do you think you can get?
[54:55.32]I don't remember how much was in the game.
[55:01.67]This is the last of... How many zones are there?
[55:04.27]Alright, don't go too crazy here.
[55:08.03]I don't want to waste all these.
[55:27.71]Please, alright.
[55:28.05]There's a bunch of shit everywhere.
[55:33.78]Oh, that's right, there's a bonus.
[55:34.68]There are the bonus stages.
[55:40.72]Hey dude, I love your stream.
[55:41.70]Can you type mustache real quick?
[55:43.10]Yeah.
[55:43.20]Just type it real quick.
[55:47.30]Alright, it's a really long word.
[55:49.42]S-A-U-S-T-A-A-S.
[55:53.03]Okay, pretty long.
[56:00.17]I can't even place anything.
[56:01.07]I have to wait until something dies like that.
[56:03.35]This isn't even the big wave.
[56:09.24]I mean, might as well just replace these with better ones.
[56:42.30]I'm ready to pop this.
[56:46.76]Oh, that's right.
[56:52.00]Nighttime.
[56:52.80]I forgot about nighttime.
[57:04.12]Yeah, nighttime, you can't use plants.
[57:06.30]You have to use the mushrooms.
[57:08.73]Cool.
[57:09.30]So are they limited or I forget how it works?
[57:12.40]So wait, I can still do this, can I?
[57:15.32]These wait, this I don't remember.
[57:38.37]What do I do?
[57:39.69]No, I can use those, can't I?
[57:44.45]Alright, okay.
[57:45.19]Alright, so let me do... I definitely want to bring you.
[57:50.91]Bring you.
[57:54.14]You.
[57:55.16]You.
[57:59.08]Yeah, they work.
[58:03.65]Yeah, okay.
[58:05.79]From what I remember, you just gotta get these out quick.
[58:24.00]Bro.
[58:31.52]What?
[58:31.76]I'm fine.
[58:38.49]It's really short range.
[58:39.41]That's okay.
[58:42.29]I'll just make sure that this thing dies.
[58:44.39]This bro has no idea.
[58:58.68]I know what I'm doing.
[59:03.04]Just wait till I get my full row.
[59:13.09]So these are just a deterrent from me.
[59:16.25]They can go right through these, right?
[59:26.42]Can they be dug up?
[59:27.80]No.
[59:31.44]Okay, there we go.
[59:42.32]Alright.
[59:45.04]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[59:49.89]Okay.
[59:51.81]Ooh, money!
[60:30.40]What?
[60:30.98]Oh, his pants.
[60:31.71]Did his pants come down?
[60:35.53]Oh, right.
[60:36.57]No.
[60:36.93]Oh, I thought his... No, he drops his... I thought his pants came down.
[60:42.61]I was like, oh, he's like, oh, my pants!
[60:44.33]And then I saw the underwear.
[60:45.29]I didn't really look at... I thought I saw... I didn't look behind the newspaper.
[61:04.48]Bro, you must be high as fuck.
[61:06.16]No, I'm fine.
[61:07.22]What are you talking about?
[61:14.14]I want one of these in every lane.
[61:19.84]It's a little sloppy, but I think it's fine.
[61:38.80]I still have the bombs here.
[61:51.82]I see this as an issue.
[61:52.58]Don't worry.
[62:07.76]You're doing everything wrong.
[62:10.28]If I was doing everything wrong, how did I just beat the level without a single lawnmower being used?
[62:15.44]Flawlessly.
[62:20.03]There we go.
[62:28.19]Small sun at first and normal sun later. ...
[62:39.67]Hey, you've collected $270 in coins.
[62:42.93]When you collect $750, I'll sell you something really neat.
[62:45.17]If you want to make it big in the Plants vs. Zombies world, you need to get it together, chump.
[62:57.06]Okay.
[62:58.22]So should I just go all mushroom?
[62:59.98]I'm going to try it.
[63:02.32]This is probably dumb, but I'm doing it.
[63:19.70]That's not bad.
[63:20.20]You should play slots.
[63:29.63]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[63:46.64]Double row?
[63:47.52]I'm doing double row.
[63:55.68]So it's two spaces.
[63:56.74]Okay.
[63:57.58]Two squares.
[63:58.08]Dude, I just found a shard of bone in a sausage I was eating.
[64:03.83]Holy shit.
[64:04.55]Be careful.
[64:06.15]Be careful.
[64:06.73]Somebody just said, I think he's watching a long play and commentating.
[64:17.49]I'm just sitting here watching a gameplay.
[64:22.20]I got my arms behind my back, like behind my head.
[64:24.84]Just sitting here.
[64:33.94]That's exactly what he's doing.
[64:42.93]What's your next physical?
[64:45.15]I actually probably really should get one.
[64:49.74]Not to get too, um, depressing or real or whatever, but I kind of hit a point a year or two ago with all the medical shit where I kind of just was like, fuck, whatever.
[65:05.73]And I just, not that I stopped going, but I had so many, back in like 20, I want to say 2018, 2019,
[65:20.64]I had probably, I don't even know how many.
[65:24.70]I was like scanned a fucking hundred times.
[65:27.18]Like almost every single part of my body was checked.
[65:30.72]And in my brain, it's almost like, you know what?
[65:32.18]I spent so much time with the doctor in like 2018 through 2020 that they scanned everything.
[65:40.67]So that would be, I think I'm alright for a little while.
[65:42.83]It's always a good idea to get checked up on.
[65:59.44]I shouldn't read this, but I'm going to.
[66:01.22]No, I mean, it was... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[66:03.46]I can't... I'm about to... Hold on.
[66:04.74]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[66:05.40]This is important.
[66:24.80]I actually like this room.
[66:25.48]It's the cheap... Uh-oh.
[66:31.65]C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
[67:02.25]I fucked it up.
[67:02.85]It's alright.
[67:03.79]It's okay.
[67:04.63]Everything's fine.
[67:06.67]How did I not have anything in this whole row?
[67:24.89]There we go.
[67:25.17]Alright.
[67:28.68]I really thought I could arm it fast enough, but I couldn't.
[67:40.62]This run is dead.
[67:42.00]No, it's not.
[67:48.67]I should have took the bomb.
[68:09.06]I think that'll be armed.
[68:20.75]Yeah, I think I'm alright.
[68:28.39]Am I?
[68:28.67]I think so.
[68:35.37]That will... No!
[68:41.31]Oh!
[68:42.15]What did I do?
[68:43.85]I think I really fucked that up big time.
[68:56.62]We wouldn't read the message.
[69:05.64]Alright, I gotta pay attention here.
[69:16.73]There's a walnut in front of everything.
[69:21.62]Yeah, we're good.
[69:23.34]I lost the lawnmower.
[69:24.06]That kind of sucks.
[69:39.81]Are your late night streaming issues fixed now?
[69:43.17]I gotta be really honest.
[69:44.09]I have no idea what the hell is going on.
[69:48.09]Those of you that don't know, randomly, sometimes between like 7 and 8 o'clock, my internet would just die.
[69:58.84]I died.
[69:59.64]I'd never figured it out.
[70:00.68]There was never an answer.
[70:01.62]There was never a reason.
[70:04.30]It could have been Twitch.
[70:05.26]It could have been my connection to Twitch.
[70:06.86]It's really possible.
[70:10.62]It's fumes that can pass through screen doors Is this any good?
[70:35.53]Hmm.
[70:37.17]I'm focusing way too much on this.
[70:38.61]It's making me save too much money.
[70:39.75]I don't like it.
[70:41.65]I'm going with this.
[70:43.85]How many squares forward does it do?
[70:51.83]Shit, I wanted that here.
[70:53.45]Like four?
[70:54.83]So like one, like one, two, three.
[70:56.53]I should put it like here.
[70:57.80]One, two, three, four.
[71:08.10]Who's your favorite actor?
[71:08.92]I kind of think that's impossible to answer.
[71:12.70]Because I really don't know.
[71:16.19]Alright, this is a better start than last time.
[71:23.62]I thought they could shoot down the whole lane.
[71:25.26]This should be a better start.
[71:40.42]It's your favorite plant in the game.
[71:42.78]The triple shooter.
[71:43.44]Alright, so I want to put this thing here.
[71:59.32]That's one, two, three, four.
[72:00.72]Okay.
[72:03.08]Why is this a fake stream?
[72:05.34]No, what?
[72:05.60]What are you talking about?
[72:23.73]Ooh, how much damage does this do relative to everything else?
[72:29.33]I'm very concerned about it.
[72:30.55]Uh-oh, that's why.
[72:42.64]This shoots through screen doors.
[72:44.20]Alright, no more of these.
[72:46.46]Is that good?
[72:53.26]If you could be any plant from Plants vs. Zombies, who would you be?
[72:56.54]No, probably the walnut.
[72:59.64]I feel like you're really strong.
[73:02.46]Or, I don't know, maybe one of these mushrooms.
[73:04.41]They're pretty cool.
[73:12.11]Who's saying these messages?
[73:13.29]I don't know, you're writing them.
[73:15.70]You're writing them.
[73:18.90]There's a lot of messages that go by.
[73:29.38]Okay.
[73:30.82]I want one of these in each lane.
[73:35.63]Now we're doing freezing T-Shooters down here.
[73:38.85]On every row.
[73:39.75]I don't want to hear about the bad strategy.
[73:44.09]Oh, we're not going to have enough time to do that.
[73:50.53]Never mind.
[73:51.41]Let's wait.
[73:53.33]What time is it?
[73:56.24]It is 8.18 PM Pacific Time.
[74:03.37]Alright, we're good.
[74:05.45]I think this is fine, right?
[74:20.00]What time is it in ancient Greece?
[74:23.83]Well, you're asking what time is it in Greece right now, and I don't think I'd even answer that if I tried.
[74:31.86]Would I even answer that?
[74:32.74]Let's see.
[74:35.58]Greece is... Pacific time.
[74:43.17]What is... Like London is what, eight hours ahead?
[74:47.93]10 hours ahead right now?
[74:51.33]No, what time is it in ancient Greece?
[74:56.56]What does that even mean?
[74:59.44]What does that mean?
[75:01.45]Isn't ancient Greece Greece?
[75:03.58]Wouldn't it be?
[75:04.62]It would be the same time.
[75:10.72]Why would the time change?
[75:12.22]It's not like time... Was ancient Greece on a four-hour clock?
[75:18.88]What are you talking about?
[75:22.12]Ooh.
[75:25.16]Seven seeds.
[75:25.86]Should I do it?
[75:28.46]Why not?
[75:30.24]Now it's 5,000.
[75:34.42]What about the continental shift?
[75:41.93]I don't know.
[75:45.17]What about the continental shift?
[75:53.11]I actually like this.
[75:53.71]I'm going to use it.
[76:03.50]I think I like this setup.
[76:04.36]It's a lot cheaper.
[76:10.44]Well, ancient Greece would be in the past.
[76:13.08]That's right.
[76:14.83]That's true.
[76:21.21]Who's your favorite ancient Greek philosopher?
[76:23.41]Oh, that's easy.
[76:24.53]Any of the ones that have their arm up and they're wearing like a big, you know, they're wearing like a toga and their arm is up and it looks like they're like almost singing, like as they're talking.
[76:35.34]Who is that?
[76:37.34]Like they have the big elaborate arm is up.
[76:40.18]They're like, oh, like this, like a big elaborate arm up in the air.
[76:43.43]Like they're like presenting something.
[76:46.11]Who is that?
[76:52.19]All of them.
[76:53.25]Yeah.
[76:55.55]That's Roman.
[76:58.09]That's okay.
[77:05.97]I know this is risky, but it's gonna work.
[77:11.20]It worked.
[77:14.52]That was dumb.
[77:19.80]But, whatever.
[77:22.49]Okay, okay, don't, don't do that.
[77:24.07]I gotta fix this.
[77:40.74]Nice, okay, good.
[77:43.74]This is not a bad spot.
[77:45.54]I just gotta, I gotta get some walnuts down.
[77:54.04]me a good toothbrush strat uh don't go too hard a lot of people like brush the fuck out of their mouth and it's just like yes you're going way too hard you want small circular motions in the teeth and don't just like don't just grind out your gums and shit don't do that
[78:32.24]Alright, we're good with this.
[78:35.63]I need something here.
[78:43.41]I need something here.
[78:44.37]I think that'll do it.
[79:04.33]Don't you dare kill that.
[79:05.29]That was expensive.
[79:06.13]Don't kill that.
[79:15.42]This feels like one of those phone game ads where someone's intentionally playing bad.
[79:18.93]Yeah, you used that one a few days ago.
[79:21.01]That one doesn't work two times in a row.
[79:24.59]Yeah, you said that a few days ago.
[79:26.07]That one don't work two times in a row.
[79:47.78]Give me a hundred.
[79:48.76]I sound like a Minecraft zombie.
[80:06.63]Not bad.
[80:11.56]What's your opinion on blue cheese?
[80:15.48]I think it's one of the best things in the world.
[80:19.56]Genuinely, it's one of the best things in the world.
[80:29.06]People really hate it, or they love it.
[80:32.71]But... I don't know.
[80:35.29]I feel like people give blue cheese a really bad rap, but they eat other shit that's way grosser.
[80:42.37]That blue cheese, that's absolutely disgusting while they're drinking kombucha.
[81:03.49]on, whatever.
[81:03.87]If you don't like it, you don't like it.
[81:10.11]I think blue cheese goes well with a lot of stuff.
[81:18.50]Does every row have one of these?
[81:19.72]No.
[81:19.84]That was now.
[81:22.20]Am I safe here?
[81:27.20]I think this is okay.
[81:31.43]No, I think I'm alright.
[81:32.05]Alright, this is a good setup.
[81:37.11]Buffalo and blue cheese.
[81:39.17]If you were to ask me, if you say, hey, dude, what?
[81:41.17]I've probably said this before, but whatever.
[81:44.45]If you asked me, hey, what is the best flavor in the world?
[81:49.93]The best taste in the world?
[81:53.62]I would probably say blue cheese and hot sauce together is probably the greatest sensation on Earth.
[82:05.71]Like, blue cheese and buffalo chicken.
[82:07.76]Like, buffalo chicken with blue cheese.
[82:10.20]I don't think there's anything that tastes better than that to me.
[82:16.14]It's just like, it's the best tasting thing in the world, I think.
[82:21.80]That, or... I don't know, how could I rank this?
[82:27.01]A really good piece of salmon.
[82:29.43]And I'm talking top tier restaurant salmon.
[82:34.18]That's close.
[82:35.90]Roasted garlic?
[82:37.16]Very, very close.
[82:39.62]Oh, cool.
[82:39.88]I don't know.
[82:45.17]Blue cheese and buffalo chicken?
[82:46.75]Or just that blue cheese and hot sauce flavor?
[82:51.55]I just don't... When I... Okay.
[82:55.71]Let's talk.
[82:57.11]So, pizza.
[82:58.77]Hold on.
[82:59.09]He's talking.
[83:00.95]Uh-huh.
[83:05.92]Okay, so they can come out of the ground, right?
[83:12.31]Wait.
[83:13.15]Oh, I just have to actually click them.
[83:26.84]I'll just start with this.
[83:28.44]I'm a click master.
[83:30.94]No one's getting by.
[83:44.43]I'll do this.
[83:45.27]I'll put them at the very end just in case something happens, something crazy.
[83:57.29]Don't ask me why I'm clearing all these.
[84:04.69]Is there a benefit to this?
[84:05.59]Whatever.
[84:06.06]I'll do it with my hand.
[84:12.38]He's been hardened by years of iPad gaming.
[84:17.25]This kind of is a lot of iPad games.
[84:20.41]There.
[84:21.05]There.
[84:21.47]I know what you mean.
[84:30.00]No, iPad games have come a really long way.
[84:33.94]You gotta give him at least a little bit of credit.
[84:35.74]Come on.
[84:40.38]Are you on the toilet?
[84:42.84]No, I'm not, but... Get rid of those, Grave.
[84:47.13]Is there even a big wave?
[85:00.62]No, I got this.
[85:23.45]Dude, you installed the wrong aim lab?
[85:26.07]I feel like this is pretty good.
[85:29.49]Alright, here we go.
[85:33.99]I don't need anything.
[85:40.00]Nobody does better than me.
[85:40.98]Ooh, cool.
[85:56.54]Oh, speaking of iPad games, the Pintar Poker dev was really, really nice on Twitter.
[86:04.79]They were like, hey, you've mentioned Pintar Poker, oh shit.
[86:09.75]Seems like a really cool dude.
[86:18.50]I like the mushrooms.
[86:23.30]Mmm...
[86:26.40]How good is this?
[86:26.90]Let's find out.
[86:33.96]Is there no audio?
[86:34.79]There should be.
[86:44.55]How far does this go?
[86:47.38]Is this a whole lane or do they have to touch it or something?
[87:01.07]Don't you dare kill that.
[87:03.29]Come on.
[87:03.75]I need to do this.
[87:04.85]Hurry.
[87:05.19]Come on.
[87:06.57]Come on.
[87:07.11]What the fuck are you doing?
[87:10.39]Okay, we're good.
[87:18.19]Sound effects are a little loud.
[87:19.15]Okay.
[87:22.31]This is bad.
[87:28.90]So this should go up front then.
[87:37.74]Should this go in the front row?
[87:56.10]crunching noises are loud hmm I don't know if I can turn those specifically down this is a problem come on the one-time use oh shit I thought he was I thought he was just gonna start walking around the battlefield like attacking people okay never mind alright I get it I get it
[88:25.58]That was a pretty big waste.
[88:26.62]Yeah, it was.
[88:27.10]It's alright.
[88:33.93]Forget what this guy does.
[88:34.77]What the hell do you do?
[88:42.21]Are you just strong?
[88:43.05]Are you strong?
[88:59.41]That thing actually... Okay, think about it like this.
[89:01.62]That's 75 cents to make somebody turn around.
[89:05.14]I actually like that.
[89:13.78]Okay.
[89:31.99]Hmm.
[89:32.17]I'm going to hold it.
[89:33.64]Hmm.
[89:52.01]I'm not in a bad spot.
[89:52.83]It's fine.
[90:14.47]up there alright I'm ready to use it what uh which lane should I use it on that's the question where's the I need someone who runs up here right oh shit wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute go okay I'm gonna do bomb right here
[90:43.71]Alright, that worked out.
[90:45.33]Get out of here.
[91:00.00]Dude, you're a strategic genius.
[91:04.04]I'm okay.
[91:05.74]I'm okay.
[91:06.48]Ooh, what's this thing?
[91:23.76]Actually, someone did say that.
[91:25.75]Oh, I didn't read that shit.
[91:27.69]All he's saying, nobody said that, nobody said that.
[91:29.31]Somebody in chat said, actually, somebody did say that.
[91:40.72]Hmm.
[91:48.97]I feel like every single loadout has to have this.
[91:50.99]What do you guys think?
[92:01.00]Do mushrooms only?
[92:02.90]I think that's what's about to happen.
[92:07.94]Is this your first time playing it?
[92:09.96]I played it a long time ago.
[92:11.62]I think I got...
[92:13.90]Like the third or fourth world.
[92:15.30]I don't think I ever finished it.
[92:17.94]Maybe I did.
[92:18.22]It's been a long time.
[92:20.42]I'll try this.
[92:21.19]So these things are long range and they duck down when they get close.
[92:29.57]Oh shit.
[92:30.09]This might be bad.
[92:37.70]I love how cheap the mushrooms are though.
[92:48.90]Alright, this one's gonna be hard.
[92:49.86]I gotta prepare this one.
[92:51.50]I should have brought the grave thing.
[92:52.78]Yeah, this is gonna be a problem.
[92:56.07]I think I can do it still.
[93:07.47]Restart?
[93:08.21]No.
[93:11.48]I don't have to restart.
[93:12.16]I think I'm fine.
[93:34.31]You gonna play anything else tonight?
[93:37.25]Um, I don't know.
[93:38.89]I'm kind of just going until, you know, just whenever.
[93:41.49]This new thing of, I talked about it before early on the stream, but a lot of you showed up a little bit after I talked about it.
[93:57.60]But chill out streams are going to be a lot more frequent.
[94:05.23]I kind of miss them.
[94:06.61]I like just kind of hanging out.
[94:09.13]Doesn't have to be crazy every time.
[94:15.75]Are we gonna get a rock outbreak?
[94:24.89]What about the speedruns?
[94:27.79]Hey, you're talking, I'm sorry, but you're talking to the seventh place Bob the Builder PlayStation 1 speedrunner?
[94:36.28]Just remember who you're talking to when you, you know, approach me.
[94:44.72]Uh, I wonder how much damage these really do.
[94:57.09]Alright, I can't.
[94:58.43]This is really bad because I got no opportunity for these.
[95:11.69]lane I don't like.
[95:16.61]I should, I need to put a walnut here.
[95:30.32]Do you play magic or anything?
[95:31.46]I'm excited for Grotto Beasts.
[95:33.90]Um, not really.
[95:35.10]I wasn't really like a card game fan or anything.
[95:38.80]And it's interesting because Grotto Beasts is sort of a... I mentioned it a little bit briefly, but it's like... It's like a decade of stream references and YouTube references and stuff.
[95:54.14]And originally, it was no game.
[95:58.02]It was just, oh, maybe we find to kind of do like, oh, you can open up and get like a holographic blue man or something like that.
[96:03.40]That was like an interesting concept to me.
[96:06.10]Like just like a physical card, just trading.
[96:09.22]Just for fun, just merch, right?
[96:13.12]But then we got this game designer who just everything.
[96:18.35]He's just like, oh, what about this and this and this?
[96:19.91]It's like, holy shit, this is actually turning out to be like really, really cool.
[96:26.45]So... Hopefully a lot of you guys like it.
[96:31.33]If you don't buy, you know, it's no pressure, right?
[96:34.20]But it's definitely one of those projects that... It's been kind of a long time coming.
[96:43.66]I know people, you know, do I have to like know, do I have to like play Magic the Gathering type games to care?
[96:51.65]that's not necessarily the intention it's just I've always thought of years and years and years ago um it was like what if what if we did like cards or something like get like a bunch of artists to do it and a bunch of cards and you can open them as packs it was like a kind of a fleeting thought years ago and decided to sort of kind of capitalize on it and just do it
[97:20.39]yeah there's a game component if you just want to get packs to do it if you want to get the starter kit and just be able to have it it was in my brain it was merch that was oh no where can we get some more t-shirts can we get some more this more that I'm just thinking what about just like a bunch of cards with a bunch of references and shit I feel like it'd be fun there are 200 cards
[97:45.55]I think there's like over a hundred cards that have some type of stream reference or stream character on them.
[97:50.65]Are they NFTs?
[98:02.92]No.
[98:05.98]It's more akin to Pokémon than it is like an NFT.
[98:14.46]Or like, you know, Magic the Gathering or something.
[98:26.82]Oh, fuck.
[98:31.58]I got too cocky.
[98:34.52]I got too cocky with like a thousand gold.
[98:36.95]Oops.
[98:38.03]I think I'm alright.
[98:44.36]Oh, don't do it.
[98:46.90]Don't do it.
[98:49.38]Shit, I missed it.
[98:50.88]I missed it.
[98:53.60]No.
[98:53.84]I don't know what to do.
[98:58.38]I'm freaking out.
[98:58.88]Got him.
[99:11.31]He just completely blew it.
[99:12.31]No, I didn't.
[99:12.69]I'm fine.
[99:20.49]I mean, the end got a little messed up, but it's alright.
[99:23.80]Do you think Grotto Beasts will be competitive?
[99:30.16]I don't know.
[99:30.54]I mean, that wasn't really the intention.
[99:33.78]It was just like some fun merch for people to collect if they wanted to.
[99:40.56]And the way it stands up right now is we have, um, there's a starter kit that'll have two decks in it with like some dice and some other cool stuff.
[99:49.05]And when that, when that actually gets time to kind of talk about it, I'll go into way more detail.
[99:53.41]But each booster pack is going to have one guaranteed rare and one guaranteed hollow.
[100:00.77]So you'll be able to kind of, if you want, it's just, oh, cool.
[100:04.77]There's like a hollow and a rare in every single pack.
[100:09.34]Years ago, there was this, like I mentioned earlier, of like, imagine if there was like a holographic blue man that you could get in a card pack.
[100:18.23]That was like interesting to me.
[100:19.29]It was like funny to me in a way.
[100:20.49]Like, wow, that's cool.
[100:28.94]I actually kind of don't, this thing's okay.
[100:30.36]Okay.
[100:38.54]Because there was always the question of, how would people in the community play with each other?
[100:42.14]It's like, not really sure, but I'm sure some people maybe, I mean, I'm sure a lot of you guys at this point know each other.
[100:49.81]I think there's a lot of people in real life that know each other, just over the years.
[100:55.80]But that's, you know, that's just extra awesome shit that's on top of the project.
[101:03.18]What is this?
[101:13.06]Immobilizes all zombies on the screen.
[101:14.94]Is it worth it?
[101:28.11]I'll try it.
[101:30.11]Oh, what the hell am I thinking?
[101:32.93]This is, you have to have this in every single loadout.
[101:36.40]I really think so.
[101:38.46]Oh shit, the grave buster.
[101:41.96]I have to rely on this, though.
[101:43.10]I need it.
[101:46.53]What's the prices?
[101:47.17]How much would the cards be?
[101:48.49]We're trying to make it so... Because it's tricky.
[101:53.71]Because I really don't want to charge some crazy amount of money for this stuff.
[101:58.39]But because it's a limited amount of cards and we have to essentially...
[102:04.77]kind of commission up the manufacturing.
[102:07.52]We're trying to make it affordable, but also, I mean, I don't want to just kind of blow up my bank account.
[102:17.64]I think this is okay.
[102:18.22]I'll go with this.
[102:27.11]There are some prices we're floating around at and I'm trying to keep it reasonable if I can.
[102:37.73]Is it going to be under 100?
[102:38.43]Yes.
[102:38.51]You're talking about for the starter kit?
[102:42.77]Starter kit has, I believe, and I don't want to give any wrong information, but starter kit is going to have two full decks in it.
[102:51.94]I think a couple of booster packs in the starter kit.
[102:56.06]Some placemat, some dice, custom dice.
[103:00.86]And it will be under $100.
[103:03.70]I can promise you that.
[103:08.79]Well under $100.
[103:09.41]Not like $99.99.
[103:09.69]That would be so... Yeah, guys, it's going to be well under $100 for the starter kit.
[103:21.36]Yeah, like $97.98.
[103:21.68]Of course, like $99.98.
[103:22.06]No.
[103:22.16]No.
[103:52.97]And trying to price this stuff too.
[103:56.15]We've had tons of conversations about it.
[104:00.31]I don't want to make it so expensive that people just can't fucking afford it.
[104:03.09]It's like, wait, should the starter... How much should the packs be?
[104:07.35]Like, 15 bucks?
[104:09.09]20?
[104:09.30]No.
[104:11.52]I don't want to do that.
[104:14.74]Even with manufacturing costs included and everything, it...
[104:24.05]Oh, this is going to die.
[104:27.99]What the fuck does that do?
[104:29.71]What is going on here?
[104:32.36]I need the explosion.
[104:33.08]I don't know what to do.
[104:37.00]See, this is a crutch for me.
[104:38.36]I'm just... Okay, no, that's fine.
[104:43.31]See how much I need that?
[104:44.71]Imagine if that wasn't in the loadout.
[104:55.88]And there are a limited amount of them.
[104:58.48]So... We don't really have... Oh, it's this store and... It's just... We have some kind of agreement where it's just going to be printed forever.
[105:08.69]That's not really the case right now.
[105:10.99]We're trying to gauge how... How many people actually want to buy it.
[105:14.37]Or how many people actually would purchase something like that.
[105:17.15]Because it's asking a lot.
[105:18.05]It is.
[105:18.35]And I understand that.
[105:19.05]And I want to make sure you guys get that too.
[105:21.79]That...
[105:24.04]even if I try to get like a starter kit somewhere in that like under a hundred dollar range that's still a lot of fucking money to ask somebody to be like hey spend like a bunch of fucking money on this thing I don't want people to feel like it's not worth it or something what are you talking about talking about grotto pieces
[105:51.18]And the idea is to make it so, to make sure people can get them if you want them.
[105:56.98]Perfect opportunity.
[105:57.64]Can you tell me why that?
[105:58.84]Can you tell me that this shouldn't be in every single loadout?
[106:03.74]From my understanding, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to get them will be able to get them.
[106:09.87]If you know what I mean.
[106:18.00]Could you play Grotto Beasts on the toilet?
[106:20.68]um I think that would be very that would be impossible I think how about international shipping we that was a question we've recently asked to the our fulfillment people and I don't think it's going to be anything terrible
[106:45.02]what we were told but I want to make sure you guys get the right info and I don't I mean this is obviously I'm just like oh chill stream we're just talking I don't want to give you wrong info can we buy boosters with channel points no you cannot doom shroom
[107:11.02]International shipping is always a nightmare.
[107:13.85]Yeah, and unfortunately there's not much I can really do about it.
[107:16.79]It just kind of is what it is.
[107:20.87]But I don't think it's going to be terrible.
[107:30.08]I'll try the dooms room.
[107:36.70]For the different rarities.
[107:37.52]Uh, so there's... There are common cards.
[107:42.12]And there are rare cards.
[107:43.69]And then obviously there's hollow versions, I think, of everything.
[107:46.53]You get a hollow in every pack.
[107:49.01]Uh, you get a rare in every pack.
[107:53.39]But what those are?
[107:54.79]That's all kind of random.
[107:57.33]You didn't get the Grave Buster?
[107:58.35]Shit.
[107:58.69]It's alright.
[108:06.25]What about anything digital?
[108:10.50]It's really tricky because I don't really know if I even have an answer to that question.
[108:13.74]Because we have this plan of like, we have this limited amount of these cards and these kits.
[108:21.58]That's what we got and that's what we're going to do.
[108:27.41]All that stuff would have to come later depending on how many people care about it or buy it or you know, all that stuff.
[108:51.43]Are they standard sized cards?
[108:52.53]I believe they are.
[108:53.57]I believe they are.
[108:56.02]Will it be possible to collect all the cards with it being limited?
[109:04.02]See that?
[109:05.56]I don't... I don't know.
[109:07.28]I don't think so.
[109:10.82]We still were talking about, like, what happens after.
[109:13.51]How do we handle something like that?
[109:16.09]Because at the very, very end of the day, it was sort of just a... It was sort of a project that was based around... Hey, what do you get in this pack?
[109:29.14]Oh, whoa, cool.
[109:29.84]What did you get in yours?
[109:30.72]Kind of thing.
[109:31.28]Alright, like, don't tell anybody this because it's a secret.
[109:39.00]I thought about putting in, like, golden tickets.
[109:43.57]And, like, just something... Like, what the fuck is this?
[109:46.87]Put, like, a hundred golden tickets in packs or something?
[109:50.17]I'm gonna lose.
[109:50.87]Okay, hold on.
[109:55.04]I thought about like, oh, what if like this just, I don't know, me giving like the middle finger in a Polaroid, like wrapped in a golden foil or something in them.
[110:03.37]But I was like, oh, we kind of, we probably can't.
[110:05.25]I got to use this right now before I lose.
[110:08.87]Oh, fuck.
[110:09.29]Hold on.
[110:09.59]I was talking.
[110:11.95]But like, I don't want to do that.
[110:13.87]That's probably a bad idea.
[110:15.23]Reset, reset, reset, reset, reset, reset.
[110:17.45]This is, I fucked it up.
[110:25.75]Reset.
[110:32.32]This time I'm taking this.
[110:34.14]Alright, I think that's good.
[110:35.52]Let's go.
[110:43.65]This sucks, but it's okay.
[110:48.85]Remember, my child bought a pack.
[110:51.37]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[110:54.27]I want it to be very just kind of general audience.
[110:57.19]Like it doesn't matter.
[110:57.83]I kind of want like some little kid.
[111:00.87]Oh, Grotto Beasts.
[111:02.65]What's this?
[111:03.19]And they open it.
[111:03.61]It's just me with like a cigarette in my mouth, giving like Two Fingers.
[111:07.40]No, that's not a good idea.
[111:10.24]That would be bad.
[111:16.86]Don't ask me why there would be a cigarette, like a cigar or something.
[111:48.97]Have you thought about Kickstarter to do anything more like this?
[111:53.43]I've thought about it, but I don't want to do it.
[111:56.32]I would rather need to be sort of... I would rather need to answer to myself than have to answer to a bunch of people's money I took.
[112:08.62]I don't know if I'm completely comfortable doing that.
[112:11.40]And I don't have anything wrong, I don't think, with something like a Kickstarter, but just personally, I would rather be the one responsible for it.
[112:21.31]Because who knows, right?
[112:22.29]And look, I am not certain how well or how poorly this project's going to do.
[112:28.51]I don't know.
[112:28.87]I would rather just be able to exist and be like a fun thing that people think maybe for a little while is cool, and maybe not.
[112:35.43]Maybe people really like it.
[112:37.54]But I would rather be beholden to myself with that and not be like, yeah, hey, everybody.
[112:42.00]I want to do this project called Grotto Beasts.
[112:44.74]Please give me hundreds of thousands of fucking dollars.
[112:48.76]And yeah, let me, uh, cool.
[112:51.09]And then it like it comes out.
[112:52.09]And what if it's not?
[112:52.71]What if you don't like it?
[112:56.23]I don't ever want that to happen.
[112:58.21]I really don't.
[112:59.77]I would rather it be something that I did than something that you had to pay for.
[113:10.73]This guy's English is terrible.
[113:13.07]My English?
[113:13.65]What do you mean?
[113:18.58]My English?
[113:19.36]What do you mean my English is bad?
[113:25.08]Are you in bed?
[113:25.74]Yeah, I'm lying on my back right now.
[113:28.56]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[113:38.24]I think I'm going to do an explosion over here.
[113:40.82]Preparing for it.
[113:41.32]Hold on.
[113:45.49]Hold on.
[113:45.89]Stop yelling at me.
[113:46.91]Stop yelling at me.
[113:47.79]Oh, he's got a huge raid coming.
[113:53.11]Boxbox, what's up?
[113:54.86]Welcome all Boxbox viewers.
[113:58.22]Chilling out playing some Plants vs. Zombies.
[114:02.76]Hope you had a good stream, Boxbox.
[114:06.05]Yeah, people are just chilling out.
[114:13.47]No cam or anything.
[114:14.39]Just relaxing.
[114:16.54]Oh, wait.
[114:22.40]No, this is fine.
[114:24.20]I have a lot of money now.
[114:25.24]Let's get rid of some more of these.
[114:43.58]I think I'm safe.
[114:44.16]I need to start replacing these though.
[115:06.58]It'll probably respawn by the time I'm here, right?
[115:09.60]Better.
[115:09.90]I didn't want to put it there.
[115:14.72]I'm annoyed by that.
[115:15.38]Okay, I think I'm in a good spot.
[115:41.24]There we go.
[115:41.68]Good.
[115:43.02]Everything is solid.
[115:56.58]What about, are you doing anything about scalpers?
[115:59.50]So because we have a limited amount, it's not just like, oh yeah, there's going to be like hundreds of millions of packs are being created, right?
[116:08.64]we're gonna be doing a system where I think we're gonna and I don't want to get this wrong so it could change but there are things we're gonna be doing to make it so whoever wants to order them can be like I want these and I want this many and then when the limited run is over that's kind of it
[116:45.11]Something like pre-orders.
[116:47.08]Yeah, we've talked about stuff like pre-sales to kind of be like, alright, who's buying this?
[116:54.40]Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[116:55.68]Because like I said, I want to make sure that it's like a fun thing for the community to do.
[117:00.83]Because that's what it is at the end of the day.
[117:07.59]It's sort of that
[117:09.82]I don't know, like, it's 10 plus years of references and stuff, and it's kind of like Omega merch in a way.
[117:20.13]Set these back here.
[117:28.82]What about stuff like tournaments?
[117:31.06]I really, I don't know.
[117:34.12]I think I really, we really kind of need to see what happens, like how people kind of consume it and what they think about it.
[117:41.35]And I am much more concerned with people being like, this was fun.
[117:45.23]I enjoyed this.
[117:48.69]Oops.
[117:49.19]No, that's okay.
[117:51.49]I think that kind of stuff has to happen after, later after the fact.
[118:12.40]I really like this chill stream format.
[118:14.26]Can you please do some backflips and jumping jacks?
[118:19.28]Oh, I'm alright.
[118:34.41]Yeah, there is a... You can follow the Grotto Beasts Twitter.
[118:37.21]You can sign up on the Grotto Beasts website.
[118:42.99]Um, what if I just do this?
[118:46.35]Okay, that thing's insane, but I can't put anything else there, right?
[118:52.44]A lot of these.
[118:57.96]Are you ever gonna get a tattoo of your channel logo?
[119:00.66]No.
[119:19.59]I just hope people like it.
[119:20.37]A lot of the concerns that I always have with anything, whether it's a show or a stream or like if people genuinely think that was like okay or cool or fun or whatever, it goes through my mind a lot.
[119:42.76]Freeze him, dummy.
[119:44.34]I'm going to hold on to my freezes.
[119:52.44]Oh shit, I'm out of room.
[119:58.17]Uh, hopefully this... Okay.
[119:59.71]Ooh, that's a lot of money.
[120:08.38]Come on, come on, come on.
[120:16.72]There we go.
[120:23.71]Do you have any life-sized cardboard cutouts of you?
[120:33.68]I do not.
[120:36.04]Sorry to disappoint you.
[120:49.47]There was hesitation in your voice?
[120:53.28]Uh-oh, look out.
[120:55.12]Hold on.
[120:55.70]I gotta do this.
[121:04.16]Freeze.
[121:04.44]Oh, this is the second area done.
[121:15.97]What about the battle axe stream?
[121:18.71]Yeah, the battle axe stream has changed a few times.
[121:23.49]I made it way more elaborate, and then I simplified it, and then I made it way more elaborate again.
[121:28.68]It's my own fault.
[122:01.44]Ah, I missed.
[122:01.98]Sorry.
[122:03.50]Just die.
[122:09.43]Your face is all smushed up.
[122:10.51]Just die already.
[122:12.71]Die!
[122:16.81]Die!
[122:17.83]Why is he still alive?
[122:21.88]Fine.
[122:33.65]Alright, this is gonna be huge.
[122:38.07]You have a bunch of dooms?
[122:38.89]Yeah, I'm gonna use them right here.
[122:40.01]Check this out.
[122:40.53]That's why you save them.
[122:51.94]That was cheese.
[123:06.31]Do you plant non-aqua... Oh, okay, right.
[123:10.03]Oh, they introduced this stuff, right?
[123:11.57]I forgot about this.
[123:12.91]Okay.
[123:16.85]So you need to put the lay pads down.
[123:22.63]Well, I mean, that's incredibly important.
[123:30.25]Do utility first.
[123:33.37]Uh... The pool stages are the best.
[123:41.96]How come you said that, like, this was a recent update to the game?
[123:46.24]Yeah.
[123:50.78]Oh, yeah, the most recent patch.
[123:53.64]They probably, the last patch for Plants vs. Zombies 1 was probably, like, 2012.
[123:57.06]What should I bring?
[124:04.99]It's pretty standard, right?
[124:06.37]I'll just, I'm gonna be greedy.
[124:10.23]Yeah, let's be wicked greedy.
[124:13.96]Yep.
[124:20.50]The last patch of the game was the Steam update.
[124:23.64]Oh, then like actually porting it to Steam.
[124:30.12]What is the oldest reference in Grotto Beasts?
[124:43.08]Ah.
[124:45.67]Hmm.
[124:49.07]That's a good question, I wonder.
[124:50.39]I'd have to look into it.
[124:54.81]Get armed, please.
[125:06.11]I'll tell you a little bit of lore, though.
[125:09.19]There are a couple of cards that are referencing a stream that never happened.
[125:16.35]And there's a story there.
[125:19.53]I thought... Okay, so... A stream was going to happen that ended up not happening.
[125:28.27]And there are Grotto Beasts references to this stream.
[125:33.31]And it never happened.
[125:35.80]So people are going to be like, what does this even mean?
[125:39.52]Why is this a card?
[125:42.33]Because I thought it was going to happen before Groudon Beast came out.
[125:56.78]Come on.
[125:57.14]I know you can do it.
[125:58.84]Come on.
[125:59.44]I know you can do it.
[126:00.68]Come on.
[126:01.14]I know you can do it.
[126:01.92]Come on.
[126:02.48]I know you can do it.
[126:03.20]Come on.
[126:03.66]I know you can do it.
[126:04.28]Come on.
[126:30.72]Wait, what?
[126:31.92]Sunflowers should go back here to protect them.
[126:35.76]Dude, don't get me started.
[126:38.46]I might do a triple column.
[126:54.33]Do not blow up from that.
[126:55.31]I'd be pissed.
[127:01.24]Will it happen in the future?
[127:02.22]No.
[127:04.60]That's the interesting thing.
[127:06.32]No.
[127:22.17]What stream was it?
[127:23.55]I wonder if you guys... Maybe we'll figure it out.
[127:25.51]I'm curious if people know.
[127:26.89]You will know.
[127:29.82]It's referencing a couple of direct jokes from that stream that was going to happen.
[127:35.38]I think they were pretty funny.
[127:37.12]But that's just me.
[127:48.79]No, it's not the hamster stream.
[127:57.77]Well, you're talking about the hamster stream, like that was a stream that was going to happen.
[128:02.43]And that stream was not going to happen.
[128:04.65]They haven't even come close.
[128:36.36]Was it Mr. Green's casino?
[128:42.03]Yes.
[128:45.97]Yes, it was.
[128:57.47]Yep, it was.
[129:04.55]I guess the stream's not happening anymore, so why don't we just talk about it?
[129:12.76]I was going to do a stream kind of late last year where I got in as, I'm talking like Jim Carrey Grinch level prosthetics and painted myself green and ran a casino and invited a bunch of streamers to it.
[129:34.78]yeah it was gonna be fucked up too it was gonna be fucking wild and there's gonna be all kinds of fucked up games like oh there's blackjack but what the hell is that over there
[130:02.85]Was it because of the gambling ban?
[130:05.53]Um, it had some to do with it, but I think just logistically it was going to be hard to do at the end of that year.
[130:10.75]And there was a lot of other stuff that I wanted to do at the end of the year.
[130:15.17]But it had a little bit to do with it, I think.
[130:17.77]Okay, wait, this thing is actually kind of good, isn't it?
[130:30.24]Yeah, I was gonna walk around.
[130:31.26]There was gonna be like four assistants behind me.
[130:34.56]You know, doing those kind of routines.
[130:42.40]If for some reason this ever does happen for any reason, which I'm telling you it's not.
[130:48.85]There is some stuff that's really fun in there, I think.
[130:54.29]Why won't it happen?
[130:55.03]Because it's a very expensive show.
[131:01.52]And I learned that, too, through the process of trying to figure out how to do it.
[131:06.04]That's a show that's very expensive.
[131:11.09]We will pay for it.
[131:12.29]No, no, no.
[131:13.53]No, we're not doing Kickstarters.
[131:19.29]What do I want to bring?
[131:22.75]I like this thing a lot.
[131:24.38]I'm keeping it.
[131:31.77]Mmm, yeah.
[131:42.95]Let's go.
[131:43.99]Kickstart me to open up my own casino.
[131:48.12]If you came across that on Kickstarter, I'm pretty sure you would immediately click the X in the top right corner.
[132:04.67]Yeah, the squash is OP.
[132:10.54]In fact, I'm gonna use it probably right now.
[132:19.12]Yep.
[132:19.96]Oh, wow.
[132:20.40]It's only 50 cents, too.
[132:25.93]I think if you had the money, it would be easier.
[132:34.79]Um, sometimes it's really not about the money, it's about like how logistically to even get it off the ground in the first place.
[132:41.84]Look at me just utilizing this.
[132:50.51]It's not about the money.
[133:09.09]Is this game easy?
[133:09.77]I would say this game is... I don't think it's really hard.
[133:15.19]It's more just kind of fun, relaxing.
[133:19.77]I think it gets really hard eventually.
[133:23.08]It's casual.
[133:23.74]It's a casual game, but, you know, we play those.
[133:26.12]Nothing wrong with that.
[133:42.19]Would it be more expensive than Dollhouse?
[133:44.35]Yes.
[133:46.19]At least that was the thought process.
[133:50.57]Do not come close, please.
[134:02.72]No!
[134:06.22]Ooh!
[134:07.88]A present.
[134:09.22]Minigames unlocked.
[134:09.96]Ooh.
[134:12.26]Um, okay, I gotta thank God for the squash.
[134:21.20]Something else that's important too, and I mean, this is kind of a real talk stream maybe in a way too.
[134:27.96]I also don't want, I don't know, I kind of don't want to fly too close to the sun in a way.
[134:32.99]Because it's like, oh, look at all these things to do, look at all these ideas, all these things, so maybe I'll do this, or maybe I'll do that.
[134:44.66]I really don't want to, you know, go too hard on something.
[134:48.34]Uh-oh.
[134:51.47]Oh my god!
[134:52.29]I need to do this right now!
[134:57.17]Oh my god, I'm not even paying any attention.
[135:01.82]Let's real talk for a second.
[135:03.82]I'm not playing the game anymore.
[135:05.46]You can very clearly tell.
[135:19.50]Somebody just called me Icarus?
[135:21.12]What is Icarus?
[135:27.12]You don't want to overexert yourself.
[135:29.74]I feel like I've had so much fun and so many of these projects have been so much just fun to work on.
[135:34.23]I guess like there's a little bit of fear that if you go too hard, too much, I gotta go bigger, I've gotta go better, I've gotta do more.
[135:46.35]I don't want to fuck it up for myself in a way.
[135:51.35]Kind of forcing myself to do a huge thing is almost... I don't know.
[136:01.03]You just referenced Icarus?
[136:06.08]Yeah.
[136:07.02]I know.
[136:07.86]Did I?
[136:09.70]You're uneducated.
[136:11.22]I've heard that term before!
[136:17.32]Oh shit, I flew too close to the sun.
[136:19.06]Uh-oh.
[136:20.68]It happened.
[136:22.26]Little bro doesn't know the myth.
[136:30.64]What?
[136:30.90]I feel like I've heard it on like TV before.
[136:41.39]He can't be serious.
[136:42.47]That can be hard.
[136:57.42]He probably thought it was from Kid Icarus.
[137:06.51]You know, I was gonna ask.
[137:08.81]Oh, you mean... Hey, they ain't even coming close.
[137:32.99]To finish that thought, one of the reasons to bring streams like this back is so I don't do that.
[137:41.80]I don't kind of just fly into outer space.
[137:50.06]I think streams like this, bringing these back, are kind of grounding for me in a way.
[137:56.63]If that makes sense.
[138:05.61]He wants us to lower our expectations.
[138:11.19]If that's how you see it, then that's probably what I mean.
[138:23.08]One winged Andy.
[138:31.11]Ladies and gentlemen, the playthrough has just begun.
[138:37.86]This is my favorite plant in the game.
[138:48.57]This is so expensive.
[138:54.18]I like the double flower too.
[139:14.65]Oh, the shop.
[139:15.57]That's right.
[139:16.01]There is the shop.
[139:18.01]Can I go to the main menu?
[139:21.17]Wait a minute.
[139:24.69]How do I get there?
[139:31.17]I haven't unlocked it yet.
[139:32.04]Okay.
[139:38.09]That laugh.
[139:38.65]I don't need this anymore.
[139:51.83]I'm going to use this.
[139:53.11]Let's go.
[139:55.70]Wait.
[139:57.64]No, I need this.
[140:11.87]Oh, after beating 3-4.
[140:12.45]Are you excited for Pikmin 4?
[140:15.88]Nobody tell him.
[140:43.19]Do you guys remember the Pikmin streams for the Wii?
[140:53.24]I, I got so irrationally angry at that game.
[140:58.53]I don't even know why it's, it's just kind of, I mean, it's not, it's not a relaxing game.
[141:03.31]You're against the clock.
[141:07.17]I complained about the Wiimote, and this is not an exaggeration, probably 30 times.
[141:12.65]Over the course of, what, two, five to six hour streams, if you break it down, it's like I complained about the Wiimote once every probably 12 minutes.
[141:27.94]And we're not talking about very, no, the Wiimote stinks.
[141:31.02]No, it was like, fuck this whole system.
[141:33.31]Like, I hated it for a while, right?
[141:37.49]Like, I was embarrassingly angry at that game.
[141:40.15]Come on.
[141:41.83]Come on.
[142:00.15]No!
[142:00.41]What did I do that for?
[142:01.13]It's alright.
[142:03.77]It shoots in three lanes.
[142:06.13]I fucked up.
[142:08.97]But, good thing I have the crutch.
[142:12.04]We're good.
[142:14.72]I wanted to cover the whole pool.
[142:17.62]But, I forgot what I was doing.
[142:23.89]There's a 32 minute video called Weemote Woes.
[142:30.33]Yeah, I'm sure there is.
[142:39.85]Look at that.
[142:40.69]Look at that coverage now.
[142:42.21]You're probably asking, what about this spot, man?
[142:46.60]Fuck this guy.
[142:47.15]Who cares?
[142:47.51]He ain't doing shit.
[143:38.06]I said, bro, what?
[143:39.14]I'm fine.
[143:42.21]This is... I'm teching right now.
[143:44.29]Don't you understand?
[143:47.28]I'm teching.
[144:17.16]I'm teching!
[145:05.52]getting overwhelmed there my teching is almost done what does teching mean it means uh when you play an rts right and you don't do anything but build all like the upgraded buildings and just hope that nobody comes and attacks you in the first like 30 minutes of the game
[145:52.36]There's plans for zombies.
[145:53.34]You don't have to tech.
[145:55.08]Yeah, but I wanna.
[145:57.10]Look, now the huge wave is gonna come and I've got a lot of stuff.
[146:03.39]We're doubling up here too.
[146:04.31]Alright, I think I'm good.
[146:08.69]A lot of coverage.
[146:11.85]I think.
[146:19.99]Nice.
[146:33.58]How come you put a three-shot in the top lane?
[146:37.19]Um... Yeah, I messed that one up.
[146:42.19]That's on me.
[146:47.57]You're nothing without your bombs.
[146:51.61]That's good.
[146:52.25]I like that.
[146:52.63]Aquatic plant that pulls a zombie underwater.
[146:56.31]Nice.
[146:57.86]What flavor deodorant do you wear?
[146:59.85]Deodorants don't have a flavor.
[147:02.05]They have a smell.
[147:04.39]Hey, dude, what flavor deodorant do you have on?
[147:10.09]Oh, it's a green apple.
[147:12.53]Um...
[147:26.05]I'll be honest, I don't really have a preference.
[147:27.91]It's just whatever is... Whatever the first thing that I see that smells remotely okay.
[147:34.29]In like a drugstore or something.
[147:35.65]It's like, okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
[147:41.70]I really don't like the deodorants that have that heavy, heavy smell.
[147:47.46]Nah, it's not for me.
[147:54.54]Alright, I gotta be careful I don't do too much, like, you know, tech.
[147:59.25]This is a lot of utility.
[148:02.05]And not a whole lot of damage.
[148:03.65]It's alright, I'll just tech.
[148:06.22]I'll be fine.
[148:06.78]I'm just gonna, yeah, I'll be fine.
[148:09.38]Let me do a regular, though.
[148:14.06]There we go.
[148:14.46]Okay.
[148:31.47]No, don't you hate when that happens?
[148:33.35]It's OK.
[148:42.23]I don't like the start, but it's OK.
[149:00.73]Why are you throwing?
[149:01.41]I haven't... We got... Look at all... We got plenty of time.
[149:05.45]I'm in no rush.
[149:23.37]Oh my goodness.
[149:23.93]Thank God.
[149:24.74]Okay, we need to do that.
[149:43.57]This is not throwing.
[149:44.55]When somebody jumps in the water, they're gonna get pulled down.
[150:12.28]Your Elden Ring streams were more chill than this?
[150:16.91]I, uh... I disagree.
[150:19.89]I don't think that's accurate.
[150:26.12]I almost, like, bit my camera during those streams.
[150:28.96]I think you're wrong on that one.
[150:51.36]That's why you tech.
[150:57.77]Look at that placement, too.
[151:01.87]Oh, you just dream of placement like that.
[151:04.85]Alright, see?
[151:16.60]This is why I did this.
[151:24.21]I want one here and one here.
[151:25.59]And then I'll stop with the triples.
[151:38.45]My favorite item.
[151:39.01]Of course I'm going to use it.
[151:53.54]Would you say that you're the Jim Carrey of streaming?
[151:55.77]No.
[152:01.09]I think comparing yourselves to other- comparing yourself to other people is always a kind of a recipe for kind of disaster in my mind.
[152:10.41]I'm just trying to be- I'm just trying to be this dude here.
[152:14.17]You know what?
[152:21.09]Fuck it, let's go even more.
[152:32.96]I'm like, how do you even make that comparison?
[152:34.50]No, I wouldn't.
[152:43.19]Would you say that you're the Jerma985 on Twitch?
[152:47.79]Yeah, I'm not.
[152:48.73]Yeah, I mean, that's close.
[152:49.61]I think maybe.
[152:54.73]This is godly placement, by the way.
[153:07.06]What do you think you're doing?
[153:08.70]Oh, what?
[153:09.08]It's okay.
[153:09.62]Just be safe.
[153:10.40]Kind of neglecting the top and bottom row, but it's alright.
[153:18.77]Did I miss money?
[153:19.33]Is that even possible?
[153:37.35]These things are useful.
[153:42.03]Alright.
[153:55.92]I need to slow down with these things.
[154:01.72]You missed money?
[154:02.62]Oh shit.
[154:04.14]It's alright.
[154:05.58]Come on, I got like five grand down here.
[154:23.80]Pretty good.
[154:51.74]You know what?
[154:52.55]Okay, let's just triple up on it.
[155:24.93]Let's go.
[155:25.63]He's like swallowed that word.
[155:28.84]Replace the peashooter?
[155:31.14]No, but he...
[155:57.67]Good.
[156:00.55]Carry bomb.
[156:05.43]After this, I'm going to take a quick break.
[156:07.59]I hear Otto.
[156:09.85]He wants to go outside.
[156:11.22]You can now visit the shop.
[156:17.14]Cool.
[156:19.34]My car keys.
[156:22.80]Uh-huh.
[156:25.19]Ooh.
[156:27.55]20,000.
[156:31.44]Alright.
[156:31.74]Let me look at this first.
[156:32.40]I'll take a quick break.
[156:33.28]I'll be right back.
[156:34.36]I'm just going to let Otto out.
[156:35.90]Maybe get some more tea.
[156:39.64]I'll be right back.
[156:44.29]I'll just keep this music.
[156:45.17]It's fine.
[156:46.45]See you in a sec. ...
[159:12.97]But I don't feel like this is a problem.
[159:17.67]This is absolutely not a problem.
[160:49.31]Blah blah blah.
[162:24.71]But I don't feel like doing that.
[163:44.41]Thank you for watching!
[165:02.00]But I don't feel it's a problem.
[165:07.12]Blah blah blah blah blah.
[165:35.38]Rawr!
[166:07.83]I don't know what you're talking about.
[166:39.15]Did it work?
[166:41.95]He's just been talking.
[166:42.91]He's just going like... Stop this madman.
[166:53.40]He's just been talking to you.
[166:58.24]Cancel Dave?
[166:59.44]What the fuck?
[167:09.70]Alright, let's keep going.

[168:14.94]No, it's not.
[168:16.70]It's twice the sun.
[168:27.23]I fucked it up, but it's alright.
[168:31.81]Is Dave a Mohg like?
[168:33.73]No, I wouldn't say so.
[168:58.52]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[169:08.31]Got it.
[169:13.05]I kind of have to.
[169:28.77]It's 1153 around front.
[169:29.77]Should I drink a coffee?
[169:31.65]1153 p.m.?
[169:32.75]Or is that a.m.?
[169:36.95]A.m.
[169:37.21]or p.m.?
[169:41.14]P.m.?
[169:42.98]Um... I'm not going to tell you what you should and shouldn't do with your life, but... I feel like that's a very late... Well, when did you get up?
[169:52.09]That's another question.
[169:55.29]Did you wake up at 1030 p.m.? ?
[170:05.44]That's a question.
[170:10.07]Are you on like a reverse schedule right now?
[170:11.81]These are all important questions to ask.
[170:30.54]no coffee past three I would tell you that but that's that's a lie there's tons of times you've seen me scream past five six seven o'clock where I've had coffee or something these bomb placements they're just so good and also what's your relationship with caffeine too that's important
[171:00.68]I need something up here.
[171:04.00]He's crying with laughter.
[171:08.95]Wasn't it good though?
[171:09.63]Wasn't it funny though?
[171:10.77]Wasn't it funny?
[171:16.68]This is gonna die, right?
[171:17.48]Yeah.
[171:31.93]A nice cappuccino is nice, though.
[171:37.64]Cappuccino is a nice kind of night coffee.
[171:40.40]Afternoon coffee, I think.
[171:52.02]Espresso and shit.
[171:58.05]Cappuccinos are fine.
[172:01.04]I'll order a cappuccino at a restaurant just to kind of make people think, like, oh, yeah, of course.
[172:06.55]Any desserts or coffee or anything?
[172:08.17]Of course.
[172:09.27]I'll take a cappuccino.
[172:11.17]Oh, okay.
[172:12.69]That's what you're ordering.
[172:14.01]Yeah.
[172:20.05]And then when I get it, I hold it up and I take a little sip and I go, mmm, oh, perfect.
[172:29.31]I don't actually do that.
[172:35.59]You psycho.
[172:36.43]I'm kidding, I don't do that.
[172:44.84]I actually really like this one.
[172:45.78]Alright, we're back to- wait, wait, wait.
[172:50.52]This thing runs over plants, right?
[172:55.54]Is it two hands or one on the coffee?
[172:57.48]I'm imagining both hands holding it from the bottom.
[173:01.91]And slowly dipping it up.
[173:06.09]Blink, blink, blink, blink.
[173:07.35]Eyes going up.
[173:07.91]Blink, blink, blink.
[173:09.13]It's so good.
[173:18.22]You're going to spill it, dude.
[173:19.34]Alright, what do I want to do?
[173:27.44]the are you talking about we're talking about drinking cappuccino guys the last time I drank cappuccino I I don't even I there's no memory I know I've done it like three times um this needs to go here is that uh no no no no alright I'm doing a new crutch it's the jalapeño
[174:02.13]I think that's a new crutch.
[174:02.87]That's a great comment.
[174:47.91]Someone said, don't use lilies at the beginning.
[174:49.33]You're ruining your economy.
[174:52.54]I think you're actually right.
[174:54.72]But it's in my brain.
[174:56.02]It's kind of wired there.
[175:07.65]I got a plan to earn.
[175:25.22]My economy's doing fine.
[175:27.78]I almost did it.
[175:28.36]See?
[175:28.66]I thought about what that person in chat said.
[175:30.97]I didn't do it.
[175:31.39]See?
[175:33.83]I thought about it.
[175:34.33]Uh-oh.
[176:08.07]I need some big ones.
[176:08.99]Alright, I need some triples.
[176:09.75]That was a waste.
[176:13.05]Maybe for you it was.
[176:15.17]It wasn't for me.
[176:15.77]This is gonna die, right?
[176:19.72]This is gonna die, right?
[176:20.70]Alright, this is where it begins.
[176:25.66]We did our attacking in the beginning.
[176:28.24]Now it's time to really, really let it all loose here.
[176:50.50]now I'm gonna put one right here and we just steamroll
[177:42.82]Everything's fine.
[177:46.59]Did you just make the whole area sunflowers?
[177:48.81]I mean, I would just lose.
[177:54.62]Maybe you'd think it was funny for a minute.
[178:13.29]Can that hit more than one person?
[178:23.61]It can.
[178:24.05]Holy shit.
[178:24.57]I didn't know that.
[178:31.67]Going down the middle again.
[178:49.68]Okay man, give me enough.
[179:00.05]I missed a gold coin.
[179:01.77]Oh fuck.
[179:02.87]Alright here comes a big one.
[179:16.60]Pick up the coins.
[179:17.50]I was picking up the fucking sun.
[179:24.50]1AM plans for a zombie skill is pretty hard.
[179:31.94]Alright, this is it.
[179:34.55]I think I'm good.
[179:35.09]I got everything I need.
[179:36.09]Let's preemptively...
[179:45.85]Alright, I'm preparing.
[179:49.39]And I think I'm alright.
[179:50.57]I'm going to drop this right here.
[179:55.81]Ready?
[179:56.25]Nice.
[180:05.15]Here we go.
[180:05.91]You lost the symmetry.
[180:06.79]You don't need symmetry.
[180:18.22]So is this a damage over time?
[180:19.50]I think somebody's asked me about my viewer count or something.
[180:32.59]I try not to pay attention to it.
[180:35.18]Because view count is one of those things that you really kind of get in your head and I really don't want it to.
[180:46.07]we make jokes a lot of time of like oh my god a bunch of people left but you know I mean I'm just I don't really I don't want to pay that much attention to it hold on every single zombie is my enemy is the thing no this thing's probably bad here it's gonna be it's a lot of water right how much is it right in the middle
[181:13.55]Is that worth taking?
[181:14.13]I'll try it.
[181:14.63]Why not?
[181:15.99]How could I forget my favorite?
[181:17.01]Does anybody else have to line them up correctly?
[181:25.10]In my brain, this is the correct order.
[181:34.43]Alright, let's try it.
[181:40.95]I'm not going to do it this time.
[181:41.83]I'm going to skip this.
[181:43.53]I'm not going to put two of these lily pads down.
[181:45.95]I almost just did it while I was talking about it.
[181:53.34]You can't play Plants vs. Zombies without beatboxing once.
[181:56.48]Dude, come on.
[182:06.69]Why is that accurate though?
[182:08.15]That's funny.
[182:24.93]Remember, what's a nutmeg?
[182:25.91]I have no idea.
[182:27.89]I just know you grind it against a shaver thing and you put it on stuff.
[182:35.47]Is it a nut of some kind?
[182:37.27]I don't have any idea what it is.
[182:52.56]It's a spice?
[182:53.86]I mean, what the hell even is it?
[182:56.94]It's a nut.
[182:57.56]Yeah, that's what I said.
[183:00.20]I said, I don't know like what the deal is.
[183:01.87]I just know it's a nut and you shave it on to make like things tasty.
[183:10.22]Speaking of that, have you guys ever seen how weird chocolate is?
[183:15.04]I'm convinced that aliens fucking put chocolate on this planet.
[183:18.87]It's literally like alien eggs.
[183:20.57]Have you ever seen what it looks like?
[183:21.89]Like a cocoa pod?
[183:24.61]It's fucking insane looking.
[183:27.97]Here we go.
[183:28.57]Uh-oh, wait a minute.
[183:31.25]Wait a minute.
[183:33.85]Yeah, hold on.
[183:34.91]Hold on.
[183:39.73]Hold on a second.
[183:42.83]Now that's right.
[183:43.61]We're gonna relax.
[183:44.95]There's no reason to talk about aliens.
[183:49.85]And if they may or may not have landed here and dropped cocoa pods with like alien fucking fluid in them.
[184:04.23]I get it.
[184:18.61]I'm going to put one here.
[184:19.75]You know what?
[184:22.01]Let's try this.
[184:22.53]I'm just curious.
[184:24.71]How does this work?
[184:28.71]I got some more tea, by the way.
[184:29.83]Anybody else get any?
[184:34.71]Bottom row, yeah.
[184:37.26]Good ball.
[184:43.76]I'm going to put a triple here.
[184:50.03]Is it chamomile?
[184:51.38]Uh, it's orange spice.
[184:52.48]I don't know exactly what it is.
[184:53.48]I don't know what nutmeg is.
[184:56.19]Something fucking weird.
[184:59.17]Shaved the nutmeg in it myself.
[185:33.91]Here... Yeah, here.
[185:39.77]I should get this, but I might not.
[185:42.52]And it's making me very concerned.
[185:44.78]Yep.
[185:45.14]I'm just gonna go for it.
[185:48.99]It's all about the tech.
[186:02.78]I kind of like these.
[186:03.78]They stick around forever.
[186:04.48]Can anything break those?
[186:05.80]This is a nice little bit of damage before they get over here.
[186:24.83]Uh, this is going to be only breaking.
[186:31.56]Too much nutmeg can actually poison you.
[186:34.37]Really?
[186:34.59]That's... that's terrifying.
[186:35.93]I feel like a lot of things are like that though.
[186:54.58]Too much of anything will kill you, yeah?
[187:00.75]That's why you just gotta follow that philosophy.
[187:02.51]Too much of anything is gonna kill you.
[187:06.79]Just do everything in moderation.
[187:10.77]Just put a little bit of nutmeg on it.
[187:12.15]Not the whole bottle, but I don't know what this conversation is, if I'm honest with you.
[187:24.37]Uh, I want one here.
[187:27.13]Symmetry's broken here, but whatever.
[187:42.38]What about too much Jerma?
[187:45.44]Yeah.
[187:48.03]I would save that too.
[187:58.59]Die.
[187:58.99]Come on.
[187:59.43]What?
[188:00.68]Come on.
[188:00.98]Come on.
[188:01.30]I need like a thousand health.
[188:18.56]I've been holding this tea in my hand, and I haven't taken one sip in my... I was like, why does my arm hurt?
[188:24.72]It's because I've just been holding it up in my hand.
[188:29.40]Hold on.
[188:33.78]Look at that.
[188:37.59]Pretty clean.
[188:41.07]One more wave.
[188:41.61]I gotta defend the top and bottom rows here.
[188:57.49]Anybody else feel like that you kind of want to play this game from 15 feet away?
[189:01.95]I feel like that would be easier.
[189:05.25]I feel like I could see more if I would just sat like 20 feet away.
[189:09.48]Just old?
[189:11.64]Yeah, that's true.
[189:30.88]Broke through my defenses.
[189:33.36]Guys!
[189:48.26]No!
[189:49.06]No, the Symmetry!
[189:50.72]No!
[189:59.67]Feels like watching a VOD from years ago in real time.
[190:02.55]Glad you're bringing these back.
[190:07.40]Yeah, I'm glad to hear that.
[190:08.62]I hope it's been a chill time.
[190:13.96]So many games to play to just hang out and do this.
[190:20.79]Expect way more of these.
[190:26.53]These streams are wicked chill, man.
[190:31.79]Check the shop.
[190:32.39]Ooh, good idea.
[190:35.85]Are these actually worth it?
[190:40.33]An extra line of... Should I buy it?
[190:42.05]I want to save up for my favorite thing.
[190:54.93]Would you play Old School RuneScape?
[190:56.33]I'm going to save.
[191:04.78]Oh, these things are awesome.
[191:08.38]I'm gonna be... If I take this, I'm gonna be such a tech idiot.
[191:13.95]I'm gonna spend the entire first three waves just building out this tech.
[191:20.85]Shit.
[191:22.45]I'm doing it.
[191:22.95]I don't care.
[191:28.36]Should I even... No, I need...
[191:32.35]I think this is good.
[191:33.29]I got a lot of things I can do.
[191:34.83]I'll try it.
[191:35.23]Fuck it.
[191:37.55]Let's tech.
[191:44.17]Play OSRS.
[191:48.98]You have no cheap attackers?
[191:50.26]It's alright.
[191:53.80]I got this.
[191:54.38]I got this.
[191:55.44]I just need to get to a point where I can put one of these down.
[192:07.52]Play Garden Warfare?
[192:11.85]I'm up for anything, I really am.
[192:13.09]See?
[192:13.93]Check this out.
[192:16.85]We good?
[192:37.58]He's not even close.
[192:44.24]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[192:45.34]Just playing something like a Garden Warfare.
[192:50.68]Like, who cares?
[192:52.45]I'm sure a lot of you guys probably join in the games and stuff.
[192:54.81]Whatever, just be fun.
[192:56.85]Oh, I actually blew it.
[193:00.15]I blew it.
[193:00.95]Maybe not.
[193:04.11]I blew it.
[193:07.97]I blew it.
[193:08.98]I blew it.
[193:09.48]I gotta restart.
[193:11.42]That was my own fault.
[193:16.48]No, I blew it.
[193:19.62]I shouldn't have put the lily pads down.
[193:21.16]Okay.
[193:32.85]Let's try that.
[193:38.60]I won't fuck it up this time.
[193:40.68]This is a hard game to take a sip of a drink, by the way.
[193:44.60]Like, my finger has to constantly be on the mouse.
[193:47.14]Because if I miss clicking one of these, people are going to Omega Lull.
[193:58.59]And I'm going to be incredibly embarrassed.
[194:07.53]Okay.
[194:08.53]No more.
[194:10.05]Just wait.
[194:10.87]Put one of these down here.
[194:11.67]There.
[194:12.29]I think the crisis has been averted.
[194:16.95]I'm getting so greedy.
[194:29.72]I had to.
[194:35.56]Oh, wait.
[194:35.86]I don't have my smasher.
[194:38.90]Uh-oh.
[194:45.97]I'm nothing without this masher.
[194:56.34]I have to stop doing this.
[194:57.40]I'm just obsessed with it.
[194:58.36]I'm obsessed with, like, sunflower money.
[195:18.75]You're so tan today.
[195:23.69]Thanks.
[195:24.07]I'm getting some sun.
[195:26.06]Alright, I gotta focus on this.
[195:45.79]Alright, fire as it goes here.
[195:48.48]Please kill that.
[196:28.15]You should play Viva Piñata again.
[196:30.89]I've actually thought about playing something like that again.
[196:33.33]Alright, hold on.
[196:33.83]This is important.
[196:35.19]This is super important.
[196:36.99]Uh-oh.
[196:41.31]Important, important moment.
[196:44.97]Okay, this is my opportunity here.
[196:49.12]There it is.
[196:49.48]Alright.
[196:52.46]Now I gotta get two triples.
[196:53.54]Down here.
[197:01.94]What the hell was that?
[197:02.64]I thought that was a monkey.
[197:31.80]Uh-oh.
[197:32.88]I... Okay, hold on.
[197:35.56]Oh, shit.
[197:39.02]Um... I need my smusher!
[197:41.25]I'm nothing without the smusher.
[197:42.53]I really am.
[197:47.75]I'm in trouble here.
[197:48.51]I have to do this.
[197:49.95]Here we go.
[198:10.47]We're good.
[198:17.37]Where are you going?
[198:31.38]Where?
[198:31.70]Right there.
[198:32.02]Got it.
[198:32.30]Okay.
[198:32.80]Got it.
[199:00.11]Alright, this is a big deal.
[199:02.86]Use the spike weed before the walnut.
[199:06.14]Oh shit, you're right.
[199:12.06]Hold on.
[199:12.72]Alright, that should take care of the middle.
[199:20.68]You jumped over it?
[199:22.92]You piece of crap.
[199:34.92]what's your language oh I have a big one
[200:04.74]Yeah, plans for zombies is... When was the last thing they released?
[200:12.04]Is garden warfare 2 the last thing they made?
[200:19.01]Alright, we got these dolphin assholes.
[200:28.43]So I need to hold these for when they show up.
[200:33.99]They're making three, but it looks soulless.
[200:38.49]Oh.
[200:41.25]That's unfortunate.
[200:49.56]If I remember, you don't take both.
[200:51.96]You take one or the other.
[200:53.38]I'm going to take this one.
[200:56.33]I need this, though.
[200:57.67]You saw how bad that was.
[201:04.64]Play something in the first lane so the water ones jump right over it.
[201:09.10]Good idea.
[201:17.44]I'll try this.
[201:17.88]I'm okay with this for now.
[201:23.14]Doflin can't jump over the tall nut.
[201:34.09]Paid out the dolphin with a lily.
[201:38.16]That's true, but they're the same price.
[201:40.10]I guess this is on cooldown.
[201:41.20]Okay, this is a big one.
[201:50.20]Save money.
[201:51.64]Squash is my favorite.
[201:52.44]Yeah.
[201:54.32]I think it is.
[201:55.75]Very useful.
[202:14.75]Let's get one in there.
[202:15.35]Probably shouldn't have done this yet, but it's alright.
[202:32.75]Stare?
[202:33.21]Fuck you.
[202:34.31]Why did you say fuck you?
[202:49.13]What is stair?
[202:50.15]What is that?
[202:53.96]Is it an emote?
[203:03.77]I can't see it for some reason.
[203:19.49]I don't know what to do.
[203:24.17]Wait, I have an idea.
[203:25.01]No, I have to do this.
[203:30.69]Oh, fuck.
[203:33.29]Oh, shit.
[203:34.09]I was paying.
[203:35.33]I... I... I... Just restart.
[203:40.63]I'm so mad.
[203:44.66]I was looking over at chat, and somebody said, fuck you, and it made me laugh, so I forgot what I was doing.
[203:52.39]Okay.
[203:52.51]Let's try that again.
[203:55.83]This is too expensive for now.
[203:57.09]It really is.
[203:57.49]I'm gonna stop using it.
[203:59.03]Okay.
[204:17.23]Skill issue.
[204:22.84]Usually is.
[204:23.36]Is it a tech issue?
[204:32.87]No, I think it's pretty good.
[204:48.98]Got to use these quick because then it'll go and recharge immediately.
[204:51.36]Brains.
[204:56.22]Brains.
[204:58.80]This will be charged by the time he gets down here.
[205:25.51]There we go.
[205:32.76]Alright.
[205:34.94]This is much better.
[205:35.72]I got way more money coming in.
[206:04.20]Good, done.
[206:04.78]Okay, we're going.
[206:06.46]We're on it now.
[206:15.29]Again, that.
[206:15.81]I'm going to put one of these in every single lane.
[206:19.04]Just you watch.
[206:26.62]pride I'm not I'm fine I'm just chilling man don't jump over that jump on his head yeah two of us can do that
[206:57.58]Can't jump over that.
[206:58.30]Alright, this is so much better.
[207:16.36]Now we load these all up.
[207:18.85]It's gonna be sick.
[207:28.96]Big wave?
[207:29.56]Oh shit.
[207:30.20]Come on, I'm not ready.
[207:38.33]I have the cherry bombs, right?
[207:52.90]I do.
[208:11.02]Okay, going strong.
[208:17.02]Go.
[208:18.86]Alright, we're good.
[208:24.50]I'm going to put one of these here.
[208:26.74]And then I want to put a big nut over there.
[208:29.02]Like that.
[208:33.65]There we go.
[208:37.67]I think this is a win.
[208:57.26]much cleaner.
[209:02.67]Nobody's getting by this shit.
[209:05.83]Look at that.
[209:06.37]Look at that unbelievable wall of defense.
[209:11.38]You'd be full of shit if you think you get over that.
[209:23.72]Two more big waves, though.
[209:25.72]Not that I'm concerned, but it would get ugly.
[209:35.64]Oh, he's still here.
[209:37.42]Really?
[209:37.72]No, don't do that.
[209:39.48]Are you kidding me?
[209:42.36]Why did he make it that far?
[210:08.10]I know that's stupid, but you know, whatever.
[210:09.75]I don't have very much options right now.
[210:12.17]I should have put these closer forward, but it's alright.
[210:19.43]It's alright.
[210:19.95]It's gonna be fine.
[210:23.04]I understand that I screwed up, but it's okay.
[210:48.66]I have a bomb here.
[210:49.78]Get that shit out of here.
[211:01.06]Get that shit out of here.
[211:07.75]OK, I don't know what that was, but I'm glad I had this smusher.
[211:15.65]What?
[211:18.08]Oh my goodness.
[211:35.36]That was a whole bobsled team.
[211:43.55]Alright, where do I put this last nut?
[211:45.07]Down here, probably.
[211:45.81]Yeah, like right here.
[211:47.83]Excuse me?
[211:51.08]Why can't I... Alright, come on, pray.
[211:57.90]Okay, come on.
[211:58.72]I think I'm alright.
[212:11.01]It's smushed.
[212:12.93]Best thing in the whole game.
[212:15.66]Without a doubt.
[212:27.15]We're praying.
[212:27.59]Do you feel it?
[212:28.37]I kind of did.
[212:28.77]Uh, heard you were having a pool party.
[212:34.19]We think that is fun.
[212:36.09]We'll be right over.
[212:42.25]I'm probably going to screw this one up a few times.
[212:45.49]We'll see.
[212:45.81]Zombies are coming.
[212:52.24]Is that enough room, you think?
[213:03.29]What is this?
[213:05.55]Give me something to work with.
[213:09.95]Give me something to work with.
[213:18.22]Give me something to work with.
[213:19.78]You gotta give me something to work with.
[213:41.35]See?
[213:41.65]Look, it's random.
[213:42.32]It was terrible RNG.
[214:30.74]Who's someone to work with?
[215:17.19]Alright, I think I'm okay.
[215:30.47]I see the vision.
[215:31.19]Yeah.
[215:31.63]We're coming together.
[215:33.55]Who's I gonna work with?
[215:56.55]Fuck outta here with this shit.
[216:25.56]That gets squashed.
[216:27.43]They can't even get close.
[216:32.01]It's worked out.
[216:56.43]I need another bullet pad here.
[216:59.62]We are doing this down here.
[217:00.92]Sorry.
[217:16.95]Alright, this is working out.
[217:25.58]lilies right here.
[217:28.20]Dude, come on.
[217:29.68]Here we go.
[217:40.08]Out of the top and bottom?
[217:42.88]Not yet.
[217:43.76]Not until I get everything squared away here.
[217:46.34]It's kind of hard to even see where the mouse is.
[218:11.17]They just run over the... Wait, they can run the... They run the nuts over?
[218:14.08]I didn't know that.
[218:28.19]Give me another lily pad.
[218:45.75]What?
[218:45.97]Because I said I'm going to run my nuts over?
[218:48.49]Alright, here comes the big wave.
[218:52.69]I need to just... Alright, I got to place them.
[218:56.92]I have to put these down.
[219:18.56]Finally, bro.
[219:19.53]What?
[219:19.93]I'm doing fine.
[219:32.33]Look at that.
[219:39.08]We're good.
[219:43.80]Aquatic plant that shoots short-ranged spores.
[219:49.11]Cool.
[219:53.51]You know, they used to call me Fog Man.
[219:56.51]Because I would hang out in the fog and jump out at people.
[220:01.03]Those were the days.
[220:01.55]Get out of my face.
[220:07.96]Okay, this is nighttime.
[220:10.92]What is this?
[220:18.20]Jeremy, it's been 10 years.
[220:24.49]Okay.
[220:25.25]Yep.
[220:25.79]Yep.
[220:27.23]Yep.
[220:27.59]Yep.
[220:32.27]Wait.
[220:34.09]Is it... Are we still... Is there a pool still?
[220:38.52]Is there still a pool?
[220:40.78]No, we're not in a pool.
[220:41.88]Is there still a pool?
[220:43.68]There is?
[220:52.86]They have to be in the correct order.
[220:54.08]I'm sorry.
[220:54.46]They just have to be.
[220:55.06]Fuck it.
[220:58.13]Let's try it.
[221:24.65]Why did I just put a lily pad down here?
[221:27.33]Wait.
[221:27.67]Wait.
[221:54.84]I'll try it still.
[221:57.18]I don't need lily pads.
[221:59.97]Not necessarily.
[222:13.37]Oh, the sun shrooms.
[222:14.15]That's right.
[222:16.24]Good call.
[222:26.60]Come on, hurry up!
[222:29.86]Okay, I know I can't really see, but this should be alright.
[222:52.76]I gotta move stuff up even though I can't see.
[222:59.46]What the hell is this?
[223:01.52]Uh-oh.
[223:06.80]What do you do?
[223:07.32]I forget.
[223:08.82]What the hell does this thing do?
[223:14.70]What does it do?
[223:15.26]I don't even know what it does.
[223:28.57]You'll see.
[223:30.67]You'll see with like a little hee hee hee face.
[223:33.35]I didn't even use any of these.
[224:00.82]I don't even have enough time to... On these early levels, probably shouldn't even do a second row.
[224:05.29]Kind of unnecessary.
[224:38.68]I don't like the fog though.
[224:43.34]Assuming that's to get rid of it.
[224:45.03]That was too close.
[224:56.18]That was not close.
[224:59.92]Hmm.
[225:01.84]Okay.
[225:03.40]Explosive surprise.
[225:06.88]I'm assuming if he plays the whole song, then it'll blow up.
[225:14.02]You'll see.
[225:14.52]Alright, so what did I do wrong there?
[225:19.35]What can I improve on?
[225:20.67]Tell me.
[225:20.89]What can I improve on?
[225:22.29]I think I'm doing one column of that.
[225:31.97]These things are just too important.
[225:33.85]Anyway, I need the holy pads.
[225:36.67]I like these.
[225:38.71]Don't take the water shroom.
[225:51.14]Hmm.
[225:53.56]Squash is important.
[225:54.40]I need to take the lantern, right?
[225:59.71]I don't want to just have no damage though.
[226:01.63]I feel like this is not enough.
[226:02.45]Is that not enough?
[226:06.03]Maybe just a regular peashooter?
[226:09.39]Don't take any lily pads.
[226:19.18]I'll try no lily pads.
[226:24.80]Just utilize this stuff.
[226:27.54]This is... I'll try it.
[226:28.88]I'll try it.
[226:35.52]If you're getting less sunlight, you should do the walnut.
[226:39.18]That's a good point, but let's try it.
[226:48.15]Bold move.
[226:55.71]I need that lantern.
[227:15.06]Okay, so it's only an area.
[227:19.18]Still helpful, though.
[227:19.82]How are you going to attack the middle?
[227:24.45]With my aquatic sea shrooms.
[227:44.12]Something in the water?
[227:45.57]Don't eat that!
[227:58.20]You piece of shit.
[228:24.13]Yeah, I should have listened to that chatter.
[228:26.37]That was the right call.
[228:30.06]I fucked it up.
[228:31.74]No, I fucked it up.
[228:33.36]I'm just gonna reset.
[228:47.45]I played it before, but not really to this extent.
[228:51.95]I played the second one on iPad and had a pretty horrible experience.
[229:08.80]Okay.
[229:16.91]Was the second one too hard?
[229:18.59]Um, the second one just... It was just kind of annoying.
[229:24.01]It really, really kind of encouraged you spending a ton of money on it.
[229:28.59]Some of the levels were so, so hard.
[229:31.88]It had these pay mechanics where you could use a certain currency and buy, like, a lightning move.
[229:38.08]It just wiped out the whole screen.
[229:39.76]And I'm talking, like, wiped out the entire screen.
[230:04.56]I just got like so pissed.
[230:33.17]I think I'll do it, but it's going to be ugly.
[230:34.96]It's going to be very ugly.
[230:45.60]I might lose the medal.
[230:53.35]Have I played Bloons?
[230:55.47]It was that time years ago when we did Community Bloons.
[230:58.78]But you guys picked every single spot because I was too dumb to do it.
[231:22.92]Where are you?
[231:23.88]Die.
[231:29.18]I think we're okay.
[231:33.72]I don't think we're gonna lose.
[231:38.32]We might though.
[231:48.28]Play Temple Run?
[231:50.00]Is it fun?
[231:58.01]Alright, don't hook this up.
[232:03.14]No.
[232:03.36]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[232:31.75]What about subway surfers?
[232:35.37]I feel like I would get bored of those games pretty easily.
[232:49.02]Would you stream Bloons... Wait, what'd you say?
[232:53.89]Would you stream Bloons TD6 for a year straight?
[232:58.49]I don't think I'd want to ever do anything for a year straight.
[233:05.01]Ooh.
[233:05.21]I like that.
[233:12.24]Two bloons with clickmaps again.
[233:15.30]That was really fun.
[233:27.63]Yeah, the clickmaps drivers were... They were up there.
[233:30.75]Do you guys remember...
[233:35.27]That was such new, cool shit on Twitch back like five years ago.
[233:41.89]I used, I overused the hell out of that.
[233:44.47]Click maps were just such a wild concept.
[233:52.92]I used them almost, I think I want to say once a week at one point.
[233:58.06]Um, not quite there.
[234:04.26]Okay.
[234:06.55]Cactus.
[234:08.87]Why is that up there?
[234:09.89]Look at this.
[234:11.49]I really like the fume shroom.
[234:13.93]It's pretty cool.
[234:19.58]Are these... Is this a sunlight plant?
[234:26.08]Can I use this here?
[234:34.25]You need the cactus.
[234:35.13]You don't need sunlight, okay.
[234:39.55]What about Peggle?
[234:41.59]I wanted to play Peglin.
[234:45.43]That, like, Peggle kind of game, right?
[234:47.17]That looks fun.
[234:51.58]Peggle is... Yeah, I've never... Did I play Peggle 2 on stream?
[234:56.98]I don't think so.
[235:00.60]Uh, this is... I'll take the small one.
[235:02.18]I feel like this is... I need the lily pad, I do.
[235:08.58]Alright, let's go.
[235:11.31]Pegolin's a lot of fun.
[235:20.62]I played the original Pegolio.
[235:34.06]It's kind of sus you didn't take squash.
[235:38.15]Oh, you're right, I didn't.
[235:39.45]That's true.
[235:44.71]This could be a problem.
[235:46.03]You're right.
[235:53.49]Let's see what the hell's going on here.
[236:00.14]Nobody down here, I guarantee it.
[236:02.64]What about Deep Rock Galactic?
[236:14.14]I'm down to play pretty much anything.
[236:15.38]You're gonna get through, that's okay.
[236:36.65]It's pissing me off, but it's okay.
[236:48.19]I don't want to do this, but I might have to.
[236:51.25]I have to, whatever.
[236:59.67]Terrible place for that.
[237:01.27]Oh, shit.
[237:01.73]I got to pop that.
[237:02.43]Uh-oh.
[237:05.57]Uh-oh.
[237:07.75]Oh, no.
[237:13.48]Well, that doesn't help.
[237:18.83]I'm not restarting yet.
[237:19.79]I was about to, but I'm not gonna.
[237:22.51]I didn't know what this thing did.
[237:23.41]I want to restart so bad.
[237:32.40]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[237:33.56]No, I'm so... Let's pull the band-aid off.
[237:37.42]Let's go.
[237:42.15]Okay, I need to get the lantern.
[237:43.73]I gotta get this thing down first.
[237:54.95]That thing flies across the whole lane.
[237:56.45]Nothing can shoot it.
[238:01.59]Embarrassing.
[238:02.95]Frankly, that was embarrassing.
[238:15.80]Could you please abruptly end the stream?
[238:17.36]I'm kind of tired.
[238:19.88]You should go to bed.
[238:20.86]You're not going to stay up?
[238:24.43]mmm that's the problem squash wasn't there alright this is a terrible team but I don't care no it's fine
[238:58.51]There you are
[239:28.95]Alright, not bad.
[239:29.57]Could have been worse.
[239:43.71]Why did you move from Boston?
[239:46.67]Um... I kind of wanted to change.
[239:53.20]I'd been in New England almost my entire life, so... Like...
[239:59.98]At that point, it was a lot of, I want to do projects and just big stuff that I want to try to do.
[240:05.12]And it just felt like being on the West Coast was easier.
[240:11.58]Just because, wait, LA is right there.
[240:13.52]Vegas has a lot of cool stuff.
[240:15.26]There's a lot of resources and opportunity and stuff out here for like the entertainment industry.
[240:21.17]Like, you know what?
[240:21.77]Why not?
[240:22.87]But I didn't really want to live in LA.
[240:24.01]I didn't want to be like in California, really.
[240:29.64]No, let's just put this down now.
[240:31.36]Oh, I need one of those poppers.
[240:35.34]I need a pop.
[240:36.40]I need you to get popped.
[240:38.84]Come on.
[240:39.50]It's so close.
[240:42.21]You fucking asshole.
[240:44.71]Alright, pop.
[240:47.77]Is this still shoot?
[240:49.47]Thank God.
[241:17.45]I was going to say it didn't get through, right?
[241:30.20]Somebody shoot it.
[241:37.14]Hope nothing comes down this way.
[241:38.28]Okay.
[241:47.44]Alright, this is it.
[241:49.46]Where is the top person going?
[241:57.56]That's not cool.
[242:01.34]Oh, that's not cool.
[242:03.21]Wait a minute.
[242:05.23]Come on, squash.
[242:06.57]You can do it.
[242:06.89]It all lies on you.
[242:10.15]Oh...
[242:31.96]Okay.
[242:32.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[242:32.76]Squash is almost ready.
[242:37.46]I need some fucking damage right now.
[242:39.98]Alright.
[242:40.20]Alright.
[242:40.40]Hold on.
[242:40.72]Okay.
[242:46.31]Oops.
[242:48.49]Please heal that.
[242:49.45]Thank God.
[242:49.97]Alright.
[242:50.25]We're good.
[243:01.23]You really should play Sly Cooper.
[243:05.17]I think I would like it.
[243:09.89]Nice.
[243:11.91]I'm eating my greens.
[243:16.36]What do you got?
[243:17.24]Kale?
[243:17.60]Spinach?
[243:18.60]Lettuce?
[243:18.86]What do you got?
[243:26.96]You said, wasn't I going to go soon?
[243:28.12]I think I missed that.
[243:33.25]That was a really stressful Saturday night.
[243:40.06]Blows away all... Ooh, that's cheaper.
[243:43.44]And fog?
[243:44.10]That's pretty good.
[243:56.63]It's only temporary.
[243:58.73]It's only one time.
[244:07.70]Blower's actually better than the cactus.
[244:10.30]That's right.
[244:11.24]You gotta try each one at least one time, right?
[244:14.77]Alright, I'm seeing dolphins and I'm seeing balloons, so... Definitely need to do this.
[244:35.44]I think I'm okay with that, but we'll see.
[244:37.92]If you got invited to something like Comic-Con as a guest, would you go?
[244:57.15]Um, I don't know.
[245:01.95]Maybe, but if I'm really, really completely upfront with everybody here, probably not.
[245:21.61]Why not?
[245:24.33]Uh, I don't know.
[245:29.53]I don't really have a great answer.
[245:33.52]I think I went to a lot of conventions pretty early on in the YouTube arc, if you want to call it that.
[245:39.20]I went to PAX East, PAX Prime, E3.
[245:44.71]I went to all of them every single year.
[245:52.79]And I think as I got a little bit older and as I kind of went to a lot of them,
[246:00.52]It just started to become something that I didn't... Because what used to happen was... And obviously this is not like this anymore, but... It would be... It kind of takes a lot of time.
[246:13.15]Like you're kind of dedicating a week to go travel and... What are you going to do?
[246:20.27]Are you going to stream anything during that time?
[246:22.53]I don't really do IRL content really at all.
[246:27.73]So it's not like, oh, I'm going to go to like PAX East and stream.
[246:30.41]I'm actually much more comfortable just kind of in my own space, if that makes sense.
[246:42.88]It's funny because I'm an incredible extrovert.
[246:47.54]Very selectively.
[246:49.76]It's kind of weird how that works out.
[247:03.02]You're a popular loner.
[247:12.78]Don't eat that.
[247:22.30]I know I wasn't supposed to do that, but I did it anyways.
[247:31.65]Funny Ludwig said that exact thing about you.
[247:33.99]Really?
[247:34.27]That's funny.
[247:40.86]Oh shit, Atriok, what's up?
[247:43.88]That's a meaty Atriok raid.
[247:47.18]What's going on?
[247:51.19]Currently in the middle of playing... Holy shit, why did I do that?
[247:55.16]Uh-oh.
[247:57.84]Did I waste that?
[247:59.46]Oh, the recharge is insane on that.
[248:02.04]No, I'm good.
[248:02.62]We're good.
[248:04.70]Yeah, I'm just chilling out.
[248:12.07]Playing some Plants vs. Zombies.
[248:13.51]I've played it before, but...
[248:17.03]Just relaxing on this Tuesday night.
[248:21.49]Get out of here.
[248:23.53]This thing's actually awesome.
[248:25.61]I like how it disappears.
[248:26.53]The disappearing is actually perfect.
[248:36.38]Are you zonked?
[248:37.72]No, no, no, no.
[248:43.80]This is way too many mushrooms.
[248:45.30]It's way too many.
[248:47.46]Yeah, Atriox is awesome.
[248:48.62]If you don't follow Atriox.
[248:52.22]What the heck are you doing?
[248:53.35]I don't want to lose this.
[248:57.69]Come on, hurry up.
[249:06.66]I really like this thing.
[249:07.46]I think it's really useful.
[249:12.27]He is Zonkey.
[249:13.23]Put the sun shrooms in the front.
[249:15.47]You don't really want me to put them in the front, right?
[249:17.55]I feel like that's a bad idea.
[249:21.60]And look what happened when I misclicked.
[249:24.28]Sorry.
[249:24.98]Double defense.
[249:28.41]Please do your Mitch McConnell impression.
[249:34.43]You know what's making me laugh about that?
[249:35.82]It's like... Dude, it's like... What time is it where you are?
[249:39.40]It is 11.15pm here.
[249:42.22]I wonder what time it is.
[249:45.16]Are you tired?
[249:45.70]You want me to do Mitch McConnell right now?
[249:49.96]Isn't it kind of late?
[249:50.72]It's like too late for that.
[249:52.40]It's late.
[249:54.27]Why do you... At 11.15pm, give us a Mitch McConnell.
[250:05.51]Now, I'm not going to do with Mr. Connell what I'm going to do.
[250:10.34]We're going to have Plants vs. Zombies, and I'm going to play it, and I'm playing it well.
[250:27.34]yay voices hooray you're throwing right now I don't think I can throw I think I'm in a good spot
[251:01.39]When was Mitch McConnell elected?
[251:02.84]Imagine like looking over in chat and it's like, you know, like Mitch McConnell, like 96.
[251:09.00]Just like, fuck you.
[251:19.58]Oh shit.
[251:20.20]Oh my god.
[251:22.14]Oh god.
[251:22.54]I don't have anything here.
[251:24.28]I have no defense here.
[251:27.30]Well, we're gonna lose the two.
[251:28.25]I don't know.
[251:28.55]Whatever.
[251:28.85]It's okay.
[251:30.35]It's okay.
[251:30.81]It's alright.
[251:31.25]Wait, it hasn't happened yet.
[251:32.27]Can I push him back or anything?
[251:36.09]It hasn't happened yet.
[251:36.71]I'm still okay.
[251:37.89]Should be fine.
[251:38.37]Everybody relax.
[251:46.86]If I get this, it's gonna be good.
[251:51.07]Oh shit, hold on.
[251:53.35]Oh, I got it.
[251:54.83]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[251:57.38]Come on, come on, come on.
[251:58.42]I think it's still possible.
[252:05.30]It's definitely I got it.
[252:06.18]Yeah, I'm good.
[252:06.84]Nice.
[252:14.22]Now do foghorn leghorn.
[252:16.52]Just rewind two minutes and pretend that's what I was doing.
[252:23.67]Okay.
[252:24.73]Thousand bucks?
[252:33.88]That's an old PopCap sound.
[252:35.04]Haven't heard that in a while.
[252:38.60]This is what I want.
[252:40.68]What is that?
[252:56.00]I told you that's what I was saving for.
[252:59.13]Get Cattail?
[253:08.94]Cattail's going to attack any lane and really?
[253:14.45]I kind of feel like I should have bought that.
[253:24.39]Do your best second Jerma impression.
[253:27.76]Is that close?
[253:39.30]What is this?
[253:39.88]Let's discourage the cowardly dog, yeah.
[253:49.66]Break it.
[253:52.46]Look on a vase to see what's inside.
[253:56.00]Ooh.
[254:00.82]Oh, shit.
[254:01.36]Hold on.
[254:03.02]You just woke everybody up.
[254:07.16]I probably did.
[254:16.25]That is... Do you see what just happened right there?
[254:18.59]That was perfect.
[254:32.69]Wait, they disappear.
[254:38.20]Okay.
[254:41.76]Please type mustache.
[254:42.79]I'm about to fucking explode.
[254:44.37]Okay.
[254:45.29]Don't bring him too fast.
[255:01.90]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[255:08.85]They do disappear.
[255:09.80]They do exist.
[255:35.83]Okay, try that again.
[256:04.41]Do it one row at a time.
[256:08.71]That's the strategy.
[256:12.61]There we go.
[256:16.18]Okay.
[256:35.27]very cool but what's wrong what the why am I why I'm seeing a lot of question marks why is everybody why are they question marking
[257:19.70]Let's go!
[257:19.96]I'm gonna turn and he's gonna kill that guy.
[257:40.63]Why you bonked out of your mind?
[257:42.23]That's the worst strategy I've ever seen.
[257:44.83]It's called the quick strategy.
[257:46.25]It's called the strategy that's fast.
[257:49.49]Just sped it up.
[257:51.67]You're definitely zooted and naked.
[257:58.66]What's that tweet?
[257:59.40]That fake-ass tweet that somebody put up of, like, I burnt my nuts with a blunt or something?
[258:04.36]That was a fake-ass tweet, by the way.
[258:06.36]I didn't write that.
[258:13.91]That's not real.
[258:20.33]This goes forward and backwards.
[258:21.37]Nice.
[258:27.03]Yeah, smoking butt naked and just drop the blunt on my balls.
[258:29.75]I scrum so fucking loud.
[258:35.00]I didn't say this.
[258:36.88]That's not a real tweet.
[258:41.80]Yeah, dude, that actually happened.
[258:47.63]You just said it though.
[258:49.71]Yeah, but come on.
[258:50.45]You should just tweet that now and pin it.
[258:56.57]You know, if you, if I, editing tweets, like if I could edit tweets from like years ago, part of me just wants me to go edit one from like six years ago and just make it that.
[259:11.04]Whatever.
[259:12.86]Scrum.
[259:13.16]Scrum.
[259:17.70]Okay, this is still nighttime.
[259:19.22]What does this person do?
[259:23.84]I want to use this.
[259:24.40]Is this the fog?
[259:26.20]I hate this fog.
[259:26.94]I want to get rid of it so bad.
[259:27.84]There's no balloons, but I like this better than this.
[259:44.08]This is not that expensive, and you can just get rid of everything.
[259:46.02]I'll try it for now.
[259:53.48]Take the little green one.
[259:55.56]Alright, let's go.
[260:15.09]How many worlds are there?
[260:16.91]I want to say seven or eight.
[260:19.19]I don't know.
[260:26.27]There are five?
[260:28.46]Oh damn, okay.
[260:29.68]Probably beat this night.
[260:32.63]He thinks he's gonna beat it tonight.
[260:59.76]Why'd you take the two headed?
[261:00.70]Uh, because it was new and it looked shiny, so I picked it up.
[261:12.98]Play the mini games too.
[261:14.38]I'll try them for sure.
[261:20.03]I'm tired, but I don't want to miss the rest of the stream.
[261:21.95]What do I do?
[261:23.65]Well, I have good news for you.
[261:26.57]If you like this stream, if you're having a good time,
[261:30.73]There's way... There can be way more of these.
[261:32.59]Don't worry.
[261:34.01]You can just catch the next one.
[261:39.71]You're just messing up my aesthetic and I hate you.
[261:44.39]Like, he... You know what I mean?
[261:46.33]That was perfect symmetry right there and he just messed it up.
[261:54.19]No, not... I wasn't saying that to that person.
[262:04.14]Oh, you're really messing up my aesthetic right now.
[262:06.88]What kind of horseshit is that?
[262:14.54]Can you imagine?
[262:15.24]What a dumb thing to say.
[262:17.24]You know what I mean?
[262:17.78]That's not what happened.
[262:19.39]Oh, shit.
[262:20.03]Okay, that's why you need to have this.
[262:23.69]What the hell?
[262:24.79]Okay, well...
[262:29.31]Get rid of this fog for a second.
[262:31.03]I need to see what's going on here.
[262:33.56]They're eating my shit backwards.
[262:34.90]It's annoying.
[262:37.90]Vibes are officially off.
[262:41.30]Vibes are fine.
[262:43.40]I'm not having a vibe issue right now.
[262:50.65]It lasts a long time, too.
[262:51.97]I like this thing a lot.
[262:57.46]I need some more stuff down here though.
[262:59.04]Look at the bottom, jump to the bottom.
[263:12.42]I'm good.
[263:12.68]Okay.
[263:25.29]Alright, he picked the same row, which is good.
[263:27.63]This is safe.
[263:40.87]I want one of these fumes over here.
[263:46.69]Alright, clean.
[264:00.85]You should definitely get the cattails.
[264:05.20]Starfruit?
[264:06.62]Shoot stars in five directions.
[264:08.32]Should I put that on a lily pad in the middle?
[264:12.41]Like right in the middle?
[264:14.03]I feel like that's awesome.
[264:22.34]I think that's the play.
[264:30.36]Yeah, that's the strategy I'm going for.
[264:34.20]I need my blower.
[264:35.22]Maybe one of these.
[264:37.40]And... I think I could work with this.
[264:40.76]It has to be in the right spot.
[264:46.59]Or I'm going to lose my mind.
[264:50.27]Any... Okay, there it is.
[264:54.95]Okay, that looks alright.
[265:00.87]Why are you guys doing that face?
[265:19.02]That's acting weird.
[265:21.41]Why are you acting so weird?
[265:22.51]What happened?
[265:31.69]Blade pad going right here.
[265:33.77]After I set up, after I do some tech.
[265:42.80]Brains.
[265:49.71]I feel like I want a lot.
[265:53.31]I feel like this is going to be kind of hard.
[265:55.75]Who's shooting?
[265:58.25]I can't tell who's firing.
[265:59.67]Right here?
[266:02.37]Okay, yeah, right here.
[266:07.57]I'm just attacking it.
[266:17.16]I'm just gonna get ready.
[266:19.76]Okay.
[266:28.27]Who's shooting?
[266:29.40]You are.
[266:29.80]Alright.
[266:34.04]Star is going to go here and star going to go here.
[266:35.48]Probably two stars are going to go in the middle like that.
[266:48.35]Because this is shoot behind, too, right?
[266:55.22]Theoretically.
[267:10.32]Is this a good spot?
[267:15.74]Kinda.
[267:16.44]That works out pretty well.
[267:17.76]If I do another one here and here.
[267:26.69]Never mind.
[267:27.15]He's a stupid nerd.
[267:28.23]What?
[267:28.47]What did I do wrong?
[267:30.37]Oh, why did you say that?
[267:31.71]Now I am a stupid nerd.
[267:33.77]Look what I did.
[267:35.21]What happened?
[267:38.47]Oh, that's sad.
[267:51.05]These things are awesome!
[267:53.43]I'm never... I'm gonna just only make these.
[267:54.81]Do they have to go on a lily pad or can they go on anything?
[267:59.37]Anything, right?
[268:05.06]They can go on anything.
[268:08.34]Nice.
[268:11.98]Okay, let's do it.
[268:44.12]more here.
[269:05.14]I don't want to neglect the bottom and top.
[269:06.98]Probably should have deleted this.
[269:21.48]Oh, the star has that thing.
[269:34.36]I haven't seen you play this game since you food yourself.
[270:08.72]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[270:11.21]During the Halloween stream.
[270:13.25]Yeah, now I know.
[270:17.67]Can you stars shoot this boy, please?
[270:20.67]They're all missing.
[270:21.35]Are they not hitting?
[270:39.30]Dude, he just screwed everything up.
[270:41.94]That was a disaster.
[270:46.70]They don't hit behind themselves.
[270:52.46]I think I should still make it though.
[271:13.43]He scrum and shit himself.
[271:15.73]God damn it.
[271:24.37]It's okay.
[271:25.13]Whatever.
[271:25.61]I misclicked.
[271:30.20]Is anybody gonna kill this guy?
[271:49.14]Pumpkin.
[271:51.34]Protects plants that are within the shell.
[271:54.40]Oh, it's like a personal walnut.
[271:56.03]That's cool.
[272:03.79]Still nighttime, though.
[272:11.30]Hmm.
[272:13.81]I think I'm going to do the same strategy.
[272:15.72]There's no pickaxe people here, so... Same deal.
[272:24.44]I don't think I even want one of these.
[272:25.62]I feel like I can cover it with the stars.
[272:27.90]If I'm wrong, we'll find out.
[272:41.25]Sure, why not?
[272:49.19]Starfruit sucks.
[272:52.30]I think it did pretty well last time.
[273:17.88]Does the pumpkin scale with faith?
[273:20.26]Duh, Dex.
[273:20.80]I can't believe you even asked that question.
[273:25.56]You didn't know that?
[273:28.22]Read the game manual, dude.
[273:32.31]With the rest of us.
[273:41.27]Can you... Is soup a drink?
[273:49.73]I don't know.
[273:50.21]Wait.
[273:53.48]I have to restart.
[273:54.62]I didn't see this guy.
[274:00.51]Soup a drink.
[274:02.91]This is the hot dog sandwich shit, right?
[274:16.76]I mean, I guess, kinda.
[274:20.82]Okay, you know those, um, like when you get a ramen, like the cup and noodle thing?
[274:25.32]It's like the cup and you put the water in it and eventually you eat all the noodles out of it where you're just kind of drinking it.
[274:30.94]You're just kind of sipping on it.
[274:33.58]I bet those of you that have had bone broth before, you just heat it up and you sip it.
[274:40.37]That's technically a soup, but it's, you can sip on it.
[274:43.89]It's kind of a nice little thing.
[274:49.16]You guys ever have bone broth before?
[274:55.17]Yes, you can drink a soup.
[274:57.77]Especially if it's just a broth.
[274:59.15]I think that makes sense.
[275:02.19]It's good for you?
[275:02.73]Bone broth is very good for you, yes.
[275:10.49]It is very good for you.
[275:13.06]Just be careful with the salt, though.
[275:14.28]It could be high in sodium.
[275:15.64]Just be careful.
[275:23.09]Okay.
[275:25.35]This is also important.
[275:26.29]Are chips dinner?
[275:27.49]No.
[275:28.69]I'm going to have to agree with your mother on this one.
[275:31.35]No, they're not.
[275:34.58]Okay.
[275:46.52]Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[275:50.50]Is this alright?
[275:52.04]What did I screw up last time?
[275:53.24]I don't remember.
[275:53.68]I screwed something up, but I think this is alright.
[276:08.51]What about nachos?
[276:09.57]See, nachos are not just chips.
[276:11.27]It's more than that.
[276:12.93]Nachos have sometimes cheese, salsa, sour cream, meat.
[276:18.05]It's not just a tortilla chip for dinner.
[276:21.03]It covers at least a few food groups.
[276:22.94]For me, dinner, lunch, dinner, whatever, needs to cover at least two food groups for it to be like a meal.
[276:31.74]It has to be at least two food groups.
[276:39.57]So if you had chips, and like crumbled on top of the chips was hamburger meat, that's not a great meal.
[276:45.61]But it's still, that's, I would, that would fly for me as sort of food.
[276:55.15]If you had a hot dog, just a single hot dog, I don't think that's a meal.
[276:58.45]Hot dog and bread, there you go.
[277:08.93]Cheese and chips.
[277:11.49]I mean, nachos are kind of... I mean, technically... I just lost again.
[277:20.52]Actually, no, I didn't.
[277:21.08]I think I'm okay.
[277:27.12]What about just a steak?
[277:28.10]No, I don't find that to be a meal.
[277:31.54]If you're just gonna eat a steak and just nothing else on the plate, it's just a cooked steak and that's it.
[277:36.90]No, like, mushroom risotto.
[277:39.60]No, um... You know what I mean?
[277:42.26]No, nothing else.
[277:43.66]No, I don't think so.
[277:46.07]Oh, fuck.
[277:50.25]No, like, broccolini.
[277:51.71]You gotta have something.
[277:56.21]Get out of here.
[278:02.93]What about water?
[278:03.73]I don't think that's... I wouldn't say that's dinner.
[278:10.83]Please die on this so I don't have to... Okay, good.
[278:15.90]You know what?
[278:16.20]I need to see.
[278:16.68]I got my setup here.
[278:18.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[278:27.82]Um...
[278:32.20]You just jump over shit And I've it's okay.
[278:36.56]I don't care about this.
[278:37.64]It's fine.
[278:38.50]It's it's fine.
[278:39.10]I'll be alright We don't need to get 100 on every level
[279:02.28]Who's being eaten?
[279:22.80]Waste, wasteful, very wasteful, but it's okay.
[279:26.97]Partly wasteful.
[279:29.63]You're not going to actually die, right?
[279:31.19]Okay.
[279:49.65]Alright, be careful.
[279:50.55]It's almost 3 AM.
[279:54.67]Yeah, I don't think I'm going to go much longer.
[279:59.33]See if I can maybe get to the last zone, maybe.
[280:08.58]Okay, I was going to say I was about to put that down.
[280:26.55]Yeah, we're good.
[280:32.67]Don't let that guy win.
[280:33.65]Keep streaming.
[280:34.33]Ooh.
[280:39.18]That's nice.
[280:42.82]Don't let that guy win.
[280:44.04]That guy is probably going to bed.
[280:47.66]It's probably like 5 o'clock in the morning or 3 o'clock in the morning or something.
[280:58.70]Don't be a coward.
[281:00.90]No, I'm good.
[281:01.46]I think we'll probably beat it tonight.
[281:02.70]At least get through the fifth zone.
[281:07.39]They just said it was 3am.
[281:10.51]Aren't you the guy that eats mayo from the jar?
[281:12.03]I don't.
[281:16.44]I like mayo.
[281:17.74]I think it goes great with a lot of stuff.
[281:19.04]Especially with tuna fish and pretzels.
[281:25.15]I wonder how many people actually think I'm a disgusting piece of shit.
[281:28.66]And then they go, you know what?
[281:29.62]Just for the meme, I'm going to do it one day.
[281:32.32]Just for the meme.
[281:32.88]Like, all of you guys are hanging out.
[281:34.16]There's like a thousand of you.
[281:34.92]There's like a hundred of you in this, like, I don't know, fucking dance hall, wherever you are.
[281:39.14]And you make a big vat of this.
[281:40.66]And it's like, oh, yeah, remember when he said this?
[281:42.60]We're going to do it for the meme.
[281:43.60]And it's going to become your favorite snack.
[281:46.22]And you're not going to say shit, are you?
[281:49.71]You're not going to say shit.
[281:51.73]You're going to be like, oh, it's delicious, but I can't.
[281:55.24]I can't say that make tuna fish with mayo slop it you know slop it up a little bit get it in the bowl and then get pretzel rods dip it in dunk it like a dunkaroo and bite it and I want you to report back I really want you to report back
[282:22.58]tuna I already there's a lot of people writing it's guys somebody said why the are you eating gruel you don't is that what you think about tuna fish you think tuna fish is gruel come on what it's not gruel
[282:55.25]All I'm saying is give it a try.
[282:59.43]Look, if you don't like tuna fish, then you're obviously gonna hate this.
[283:05.29]I grew up on tuna fish.
[283:06.77]I grew up on tuna fish sandwiches.
[283:16.26]Shit.
[283:20.94]I sound like I have a shit face.
[283:25.56]You kids don't know what it's like.
[283:27.18]I grew up on tuna fish sandwiches.
[283:29.82]And they were fucking delicious.
[283:32.16]Look how I turned out, you little shits.
[283:40.24]Okay, let's go.
[283:42.96]This is the last level.
[283:49.43]Should I take the smush?
[283:52.51]Nah.
[283:55.70]I don't really like these.
[283:56.46]Not for here.
[283:58.14]I'll try this, though.
[284:03.90]Tuna sandwich and a can of ginger ale.
[284:05.40]Mega comfort food.
[284:08.78]Leather jacket said that.
[284:09.81]Oh, man.
[284:10.43]That sounds pretty great.
[284:14.35]A nice fresh ginger ale.
[284:18.47]Which is like a tuna sandwich with a piece of Swiss cheese on it.
[284:25.41]Even a tuna melt or something.
[284:26.57]Tuna melts.
[284:27.39]Oh, well, maybe a little bit.
[284:28.70]Maybe get a little wild.
[284:30.14]Put a little bit of avocado on it.
[284:32.18]You know what I mean?
[284:44.70]Tuna melts are really good.
[284:48.09]There's a lot of people that really don't like fish at all.
[284:51.03]And I get it.
[284:52.13]But to me, tuna fish is barely even fish.
[284:56.87]Maybe it's because I was just so used to it growing up eating it.
[285:00.19]I had it all the time.
[285:00.88]It was not... Oh, it's fish.
[285:05.22]I know that sounds weird to say that, but it doesn't feel like it's fish.
[285:10.88]It feels like it's just food.
[285:13.88]I'm explaining this really wrong.
[285:16.20]What about pickles?
[285:16.84]Yeah.
[285:27.11]Who's firing?
[285:28.01]OK, you guys are firing.
[285:35.36]It's like chicken.
[285:39.53]Especially if you add a little bit of pickles or relish or something.
[285:43.00]A little bit of cheese.
[285:45.72]I think people... Tuna fish, obviously, you don't want to eat it all the fucking time.
[285:51.18]Because tuna has Mercury and you can't have Mercury.
[285:55.05]You can't have too much Mercury.
[285:56.13]You can get it.
[286:00.83]But it's really easy.
[286:04.04]You can get a bunch of tuna, and here's the good thing about tuna from a can, right?
[286:07.91]Just regular ass tuna.
[286:09.67]Nothing crazy.
[286:11.57]It lasts a really long time.
[286:13.07]And you can just get a bunch of it, and you can make a full meal with a can of this shit.
[286:31.34]Okay, I gotta be ready here.
[286:47.02]Don't eat that.
[286:48.12]Where are you?
[286:48.60]Okay.
[286:49.16]This is alright.
[286:55.09]How about this?
[287:00.41]Get that hat off.
[287:04.07]Wait.
[287:04.79]How close does that have to be?
[287:08.74]Uh-oh.
[287:16.45]It's not metal?
[287:17.79]I thought it took... I thought it was metal and hats.
[287:20.29]I thought it was hats.
[287:28.09]It's plastic.
[287:29.63]Yeah, but I thought it was like removes hats.
[287:49.34]Okay, I should be alright.
[288:03.38]Missed middle row.
[288:04.14]Alright, I'm good.
[288:05.50]Oops, sorry.
[288:16.82]Oh shit.
[288:17.88]Oh shit.
[288:18.36]Oh shit.
[288:18.88]Oh shit.
[288:19.40]Oh shit.
[288:19.96]Oh shit.
[288:21.44]Oh shit.
[288:22.08]Oh shit.
[288:23.48]Can he float over that?
[288:25.89]Wait!
[288:26.09]Oh boy!
[288:26.61]What am I thinking?
[288:27.83]What a waste.
[288:29.85]I'm sorry.
[288:30.31]That was dumb.
[288:43.48]Alright, I'm still fine.
[288:45.78]Gotta take care of this bottom row here.
[289:03.89]Take this hat off!
[289:04.79]This is metal?
[289:06.01]This is made out of fucking aluminum!
[289:22.58]I think it's so good.
[289:26.98]So many of these assholes too.
[289:38.65]Yeah, it started pretty late.
[289:43.33]No real plan with this one.
[289:44.23]I just kind of felt like turning it on.
[289:51.27]Which, expect way more of these.
[289:52.92]I know I keep saying that, but... I really like this shit.
[289:56.02]I do.
[289:59.94]I did miss it a lot.
[290:03.32]Don't eat that.
[290:11.86]Um... Come on.
[290:17.59]Uh-oh.
[290:19.21]Uh-oh.
[290:20.21]No, we're good.
[290:29.15]get something in the way.
[290:31.88]This second to last row has nothing on it.
[290:34.54]I'm going to hold that for now.
[291:07.67]They gotta be close.
[291:11.30]Jesus.
[291:16.72]Alright, world four done.
[291:20.82]Look at that.
[291:28.49]Only one more world, yeah.
[291:35.44]This is your mother.
[291:36.02]Please come over to my house for meatloaf.
[291:38.20]Leave your front door open and your lawn unguarded.
[291:40.66]This is not the zombies.
[291:45.74]I think it's so dark.
[291:48.86]Can't be good.
[291:49.96]Oh well, hope you survive the night.
[291:51.00]Do you guys like meatloaf?
[292:05.46]Meatloaf sucks.
[292:07.26]Unless your mom makes it.
[292:10.59]That's just a fact, I think.
[292:11.63]Come on, let me see.
[292:22.32]Okay, it's right there.
[292:26.38]Oh, shit.
[292:27.94]Okay, hold on a second.
[292:29.14]Okay.
[292:34.99]He said the same thing five years ago.
[292:36.25]It's true.
[292:46.98]This can go anywhere.
[293:12.30]Don't crunch.
[293:14.24]Ah, I hear the crunches.
[293:18.06]Ah!
[293:18.22]Shit.
[293:37.92]Motherfuckers down here.
[293:51.09]Oh my god.
[293:53.21]Dr. Clay just linked a fucking sandwich and the thing looks awesome.
[293:58.18]Holy shit.
[294:03.06]Turkey sub with everything on it.
[294:07.34]Oh, that sounds awesome.
[294:16.87]He goes, oh, whoops.
[294:18.11]Sorry about that.
[294:18.91]No, it's all good.
[294:21.67]With everything on it?
[294:22.25]Oh, you know when everything's on it.
[294:23.93]You know it's gonna be good.
[294:26.65]Get that thing stacked up.
[294:27.95]Lettuce.
[294:29.41]Pickles.
[294:30.01]Mayo.
[294:30.83]Cheese and shit.
[294:35.69]Get everything on that.
[294:36.50]And I want it to be... I want the lettuce to be falling out of the outside of the bun.
[294:43.38]It's fucked up.
[295:11.08]I don't really want them anymore.
[295:40.29]Okay.
[295:42.09]Not a bad setup.
[295:46.67]Yeah, I don't think there's anything better.
[295:47.87]Should I use this?
[295:51.61]Is everybody flying right now?
[296:02.02]Use the blower to get rid of it.
[296:02.80]I missed it.
[296:24.60]He's dead, okay.
[296:26.92]Oh shit, we're good.
[296:33.44]Is there any space for anything?
[296:52.66]Show me!
[297:25.17]Shit.
[297:27.79]This top water lane needs a... Give me a blower.
[297:33.77]Give me a blower.
[297:34.47]Give me a blower before I'm in trouble.
[297:36.59]Give me a blower.
[297:37.05]Give me a blower.
[297:37.49]Give me a blower.
[297:37.85]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[297:39.53]Place it.
[297:41.47]Yes.
[297:41.73]I got it.
[297:58.10]It's almost a full stack of shit here.
[298:13.22]Any more flying people?
[298:14.08]No.
[298:14.60]Oh, we're good.
[298:20.18]Ooh!
[298:25.18]A cabbage thrower.
[298:29.89]Is that achievement?
[298:31.09]Burrows cabbages at the enemy.
[298:33.45]They even found a way onto your roof.
[298:39.00]Those are some persistent zombies, dude.
[298:41.16]There's a cabbage pulse.
[298:44.02]Okay.
[298:47.39]You can finish the game in one sitting.
[298:51.01]Yeah.
[298:52.15]I think that's probably accurate.
[299:00.38]I don't know what that thing is, but it's kind of scary.
[299:05.85]I'm going to drive people crazy with this, by the way.
[299:10.57]I'm only taking this.
[299:14.68]And I'm going to drive some of you crazy.
[299:23.00]Okay.
[299:23.78]So we got cabbage.
[299:27.10]Triple shooter.
[299:27.69]Does this work here?
[299:30.64]squasher uh boom boom uh boom boom no boom um boom no boom no yeah okay
[300:01.31]I'm already getting Luigi'd?

[300:35.53]Right You have to put it on a sunflower Oh Yeah, oh I can only put it in this many slots This game sucks
[301:17.77]Omegalo shrew.
[301:24.15]What?
[301:25.13]Oh, that's annoying.
[301:25.73]Cool.
[301:51.75]I know people are going to say, stop doing this.
[301:53.95]Just let me do it.
[301:58.88]I want a million, son.
[302:24.08]Okay, almost.
[302:24.82]Alright, now we double all of these.
[302:32.01]Oh, fuck.
[302:32.49]Alright.
[302:32.83]Oops.
[302:33.43]I think it's okay.
[302:36.48]It's not okay.
[302:58.75]What's that?
[303:02.80]That same enemy is in Sekiro.
[303:38.13]Can you shoot?
[303:38.55]Is this working?
[303:40.57]Is it hitting the ground?
[303:42.51]Oh, shit.
[303:46.12]I think it's hitting the ground.
[303:50.76]Can you only use the cabbage?
[304:09.26]Oh, shit.
[304:09.72]Okay, well, that's good to know.
[304:16.64]Is there any way I can stop that from happening?
[304:19.96]That sucks.
[304:36.07]Shit, I want to get all of them.
[304:38.00]Ah!
[304:49.43]Well, now I know.
[304:50.05]Extra pot.
[304:58.84]You don't have lawnmowers.
[305:00.76]Ooh.
[305:01.04]Interesting.
[305:01.40]Did I get this?
[305:39.29]Only losers get that.
[305:40.93]What does it do?
[305:55.57]So, it's only the cabbages can hurt anything.
[305:58.13]And the smoosher.
[306:01.43]These can't shoot up.
[306:15.16]The cat is OP.
[306:18.91]The front most plants can attack.
[306:22.37]Oh, well then let's fucking go.
[306:41.21]The pumpkin will protect the grab.
[306:43.51]Oh, good.
[306:44.13]That's good to know.
[306:44.81]If I don't do it this time, I'll do it.
[307:12.95]I'm gonna hold off.
[307:13.55]I got an interesting plan here.
[307:41.53]That turkey sandwich looked fucking awesome.
[307:44.47]It really did.
[308:02.49]He loves tuna sandwiches.
[308:03.75]Uh-oh.
[308:04.17]It's alright.
[308:05.66]No, no, no.
[308:05.88]I got the squisher.
[308:07.38]This is why you bring the squisher every time.
[308:09.04]There's no reason to ever take this off of your loadout.
[308:11.22]Ever.
[308:13.91]An instant kill and it's only 50 cents.
[308:18.93]So good.
[308:32.36]Landmines better the landmines a little cheaper But it takes too long to arm if you really are in a pinch and you really need to you got to get out of there This question is your friend
[308:59.05]This is definitely pre-recorded.
[309:00.28]You're definitely naked and watching the VOD right now.
[309:03.36]Like, with you guys?
[309:04.28]Oh.
[309:11.52]Based.
[309:26.63]What you guys don't know is, at the end of the stream, I forgot to make sure the stream turned off.
[309:33.51]I fell asleep here.
[309:36.12]And the video just starts over again.
[309:37.64]Okay, let me get this right.
[310:00.50]I'm not going to let you do that.
[310:01.38]Wrong lane, you idiot.
[310:06.73]I thought he was at the top.
[310:08.77]Shit.
[310:13.51]This is why the smusher is the best thing.
[310:15.20]Look at this.
[310:16.30]You think this guy is going to let you get by?
[310:17.90]Get out of here.
[310:34.59]It would be way more effort for you to pretend to play than to just play.
[310:37.69]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[310:45.07]How much of a fraud do you guys think I am?
[310:53.80]There we go.
[310:54.32]Perfect placement.
[311:15.41]Detective stream was a neat idea.
[311:27.03]You know, that's one of my favorite streams.
[311:30.89]That's one of my favorite things I've ever done.
[311:32.31]I had so much fun on that night.
[311:57.52]I don't know if there's a lot of people that don't know what we're talking about, but five years ago, I pre-recorded a whole stream, and the whole goal was I had a bunch of fake accounts that were me, and I was just typing in the chat, watching the VOD with everybody on fake accounts, and every like 30 minutes or so, every 20 minutes, the video would stop, and an alarm would sound, and everybody had 10 seconds to guess who I was in the chat.
[312:27.66]I don't think we could do that again.
[312:28.80]I think there's too many people here now.
[312:34.63]That was back... that was... what were there?
[312:36.97]Like a thousand viewers or something?
[312:38.67]Fifteen hundred or something?
[312:45.88]I don't know if that would work very well now.
[312:48.46]Like 3k?
[312:48.98]Yeah.
[312:53.06]Leave my shit alone!
[312:57.68]Whatever.
[312:57.94]I have so much money.
[313:14.29]I had a great name, too.
[313:17.69]One of my favorite names, what was it?
[313:19.43]Binaryman0010110001.
[313:31.04]I forget what some of the other ones were.
[313:33.66]I had like seven or eight, didn't I?
[313:43.94]Ooh, corn.
[313:55.13]That's the worst joke of all time.
[313:57.89]I don't think so.
[313:58.59]I thought it was fun.
[314:10.36]I'm happy with this.
[314:18.16]Even less.
[314:19.25]That kind of sucks.
[314:21.25]Maybe when you did a rebroadcast of The Simpsons Hit and Run.
[314:38.09]And I wouldn't just let it play.
[314:39.47]I kept showing up and pausing it and being like, oh, let me tell you about this.
[314:43.67]I remember people screaming at me, just saying, get the fuck out of here.
[314:48.59]We're trying to watch this.
[314:49.41]Did corn go first?
[315:05.16]It's just the butter, right?
[315:07.28]Or is it butter or is it kernels?
[315:09.02]Let's find out.
[315:12.31]It's butter, right?
[315:15.01]Oh, no, it's kernels.
[315:16.35]I thought he had like a pat of butter.
[315:24.30]Oh, it is both, okay.
[315:40.07]You're gonna eat the pot?
[315:41.79]Get out of here.
[315:42.51]You just made me waste 25 cents.
[315:53.58]Got a pre-recorded webcam bit from Hotline Miami.
[316:00.58]Oh, yeah.
[316:03.24]Yeah.
[316:03.54]I don't even remember what that was.
[316:22.09]you kept talking while you were drinking oh that's right yeah because I I recorded like 10 minutes straight of webcam footage and just looped it in the corner of the screen what the hell am I what the hell is wrong with me
[316:53.05]Don't.
[316:54.71]Did I just really kill him?
[316:56.24]I did, didn't I?
[316:57.08]Come on.
[316:59.18]What the fuck?
[316:59.87]This guy's superhuman.
[317:01.25]You're superhuman.
[317:02.05]Why are you still alive?
[317:33.70]I'm gonna die and then the next one's gonna get killed by the... Okay.
[317:59.42]I don't think I'm prepared, but we'll see what happens.
[318:07.13]Is this too much corn?
[318:15.81]Are you sleepy?
[318:20.05]I'm a little bit tired, but I'm okay.
[318:24.59]I figured probably at the end of this, I'll maybe try a minigame or two and then take off.
[318:38.56]Did I miss a dime?
[318:40.58]Whatever that is.
[318:55.52]Okay.
[318:57.12]Just doing all corn.
[318:59.57]Corn only.
[319:17.78]You know, actually, I'm not a huge corn fan.
[319:22.74]I love... I love that corn is in something.
[319:26.40]You know, like corn meal.
[319:27.80]Like corn tortillas.
[319:31.29]But I'm... I don't know.
[319:32.73]I'm not like a... Just an ear of corn.
[319:34.59]I have to be really in the mood for it.
[319:38.89]What the hell?
[319:43.42]That's not good.
[319:55.32]but I need to really really want it I just don't like what it does to your teeth it seems like every single space between every single tooth has like paper stuck in it after you eat corn this is like a lot of the way it tastes but it's just kind of annoying
[320:24.61]I don't know why I just did that, but okay.
[320:27.53]Why is this ladder still here?
[320:34.34]Nope.
[320:49.45]What?
[320:51.05]You can even climb over the big ones?
[321:01.47]Then they can climb over them.
[321:02.81]That's annoying.
[321:03.47]I need a mushroom to wake it up.
[321:09.23]Wake it up.
[321:29.18]I mean, I can use... Oh.
[321:35.91]Hmm.
[321:40.82]I kind of like the setup I had.
[321:49.15]I don't think there's anything I really want from here.
[322:04.30]Bring the magnet.
[322:08.58]Yeah, I don't think I want to do that.
[322:09.58]I'll stick with what I was doing.
[322:11.46]I think it was better.
[322:33.37]Oh, that's right.
[322:33.89]No squish.
[322:34.33]It's okay.
[322:37.29]We'll deal.
[322:40.61]We'll deal with it.
[322:41.70]Okay.
[322:51.72]Magnet is a shroom.
[322:53.36]Oh.
[322:53.50]That's right.
[322:59.46]I'll deal with it.
[323:14.82]Does the cabbage do more damage than the corn?
[323:16.91]I have to imagine it probably does because the corn is a slow stun.
[323:26.61]I probably need a few more of those then.
[323:27.77]I did way too much corn last time.
[323:30.49]It does pea shooter damage.
[323:58.93]You gotta go.
[323:59.59]I don't have my smush.
[324:00.37]Done.
[324:00.75]Done.
[324:04.63]Done.
[324:05.19]Nice.
[324:30.50]It's done again!
[324:30.92]It's done again!
[324:33.36]Yes!
[324:36.63]Brains.
[324:42.39]This has got three.
[324:48.29]This is gonna be tricky.
[324:55.73]This game won a Grammy for its soundtrack.
[324:57.65]I mean, the soundtrack does go really hard.
[324:59.45]It's a really good soundtrack.
[325:11.89]I gotta have at least two in each row.
[325:21.88]Bro, why are you streaming right now?
[325:23.78]I'm just hanging up.
[325:34.18]down here.
[325:34.52]It was unironically added to the Library of Congress.
[325:51.24]Didn't you guys give me shit for that before?
[325:52.74]Because you said that Cars 2 is in the Library of Congress and there was a bunch of people laughing about it.
[326:05.36]I made some argument saying, no, no, you don't understand.
[326:07.72]This is in the library of Congress.
[326:09.34]And people were like, yeah, bro.
[326:11.04]Cars 2 is as well.
[326:19.51]Done.
[326:21.65]Can we get a stun?
[326:24.53]Thank goodness.
[326:28.97]Everything is in the library of Congress.
[326:33.13]It's true.
[326:37.26]You know what's funny?
[326:37.96]I've never seen a single Cars movie.
[326:42.33]If you said I'll give you a million dollars if you can name three characters in that movie, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[326:46.71]I wouldn't be able to name you two.
[326:50.11]I think I can name you one.
[326:57.46]I could not name you more than two people in that movie.
[327:11.25]I've never seen any of the Cars movies.
[327:12.45]None of them.
[327:13.91]Alright, this is where I'm going to be prepared.
[327:31.87]I think I'm prepared.
[327:34.57]Pretty good setup.
[327:38.05]Some walnuts here.
[327:43.02]Ah, give me that.
[327:51.49]He's dead, never mind.
[327:59.62]I'd rather eat a head of lettuce or a raw ear of corn.
[328:01.96]Isn't a raw ear of corn hard?
[328:03.76]Where they kind of hurt, break your teeth or something?
[328:05.58]Are they like really kind of like...
[328:28.87]It's so fresh and crisp.
[328:32.11]I'm going to have to disagree.
[328:35.49]Sorry.
[328:35.83]There's a whole other wave coming too.
[328:45.24]I think it's just protect.
[328:46.06]And that's it.
[329:15.88]No, give that to me!
[329:16.68]Uh-oh.
[329:18.18]I got really... Oh, I got really cocky.
[329:21.42]I got really cocky.
[329:22.34]I'm gonna have to replace this shit.
[329:33.89]Come on, it's okay.
[329:38.48]Just kill him.
[329:40.84]Dude, you're not actually gonna... You fucking asshole.
[329:49.33]You fucking dick.
[329:50.99]Get out of here.
[329:53.89]He's ruining everything.
[330:15.35]They're all getting through.
[330:50.70]How are you still alive?
[330:52.28]Does this make any sense?
[330:53.32]Die.
[330:53.64]Oh my goodness.
[330:56.98]Uh-oh.
[331:03.12]Suck that thing out of his hands.
[331:05.18]Oh, this thing is a mushroom.
[331:06.95]I forgot.
[331:07.73]Oh, no.
[331:08.29]Alright.
[331:08.73]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[331:16.95]I'm still going to be fine.
[331:22.53]Oh, fuck.
[331:24.69]Oh, fuck.
[331:27.43]Oh, shit.
[331:28.57]Oh, shit.
[331:29.49]Oh, shit.
[331:35.83]Everything needs to be clicked on.
[331:37.07]That's alright.
[331:37.75]I don't care.
[331:38.15]I didn't have to 100% it.
[331:38.75]It's fine.
[331:41.03]Just get run over.
[331:42.80]Whatever.
[331:45.24]Jeremy, you'd be really bad at StarCraft.
[331:49.06]Yeah, I'm never gonna play StarCraft.
[331:54.64]That sounds like a bad idea.
[332:00.69]Now you can play Zen Garden mode.
[332:02.69]Oh.
[332:03.21]Couple of sprouts.
[332:03.83]Ooh, money.
[332:24.36]How much should I do this for?
[332:25.18]Can I just do this forever?
[332:28.91]It's 10 bucks every time.
[332:39.36]Your plant needs fertilizer.
[332:40.62]Visit the shop, pick up some fertilizer?
[332:42.20]Oh dear.
[332:55.76]That's pretty good.
[333:03.21]I mean, I feel like I don't want to buy that right now.
[333:07.59]Nah.
[333:09.77]Oh, he gave me some for free.
[333:13.81]Cool.
[333:13.91]Cool.
[333:27.02]Zedengar is pretty nifty, huh?
[333:28.52]You can visit it at any time from the main menu.
[333:31.40]Bend your house.
[333:32.02]I have to warn you.
[333:32.64]You're going to hate this next level.
[333:35.09]It's non-stop bungee zombie after bungee zombie.
[333:37.83]I hate those.
[333:38.57]Alright, so I need... So the strategy here is... Oh.
[333:40.47]Okay.
[333:40.85]Okay.
[334:00.25]I have to use it.
[334:00.89]Oh, I can do this?
[334:04.65]Chomper!
[334:05.33]Thanks.
[334:38.47]Is he going to be chewed by the time he gets over here?
[334:41.26]Yep.
[334:42.08]Chew.
[334:42.64]Chew him up.
[335:13.03]Swallow him, hurry.
[335:13.93]Swallow him.
[335:18.81]Oh my goodness.
[335:19.39]Did you just eat him already?
[336:18.43]Oh, they have bigger range.
[336:21.11]Okay, cool.
[336:23.34]Do you have bombs?
[336:35.05]I'm saving them.
[336:51.47]Hey!
[336:53.93]Oh, they get eaten though.
[336:58.51]Great bone.
[336:59.75]I'm not letting that guy over here.
[337:18.32]Somebody eat him.
[337:20.05]Somebody eat him!
[337:22.47]What is happening?
[337:25.18]Eat this guy!
[337:51.83]Okay.
[337:55.83]That's the strategy right there.
[338:07.59]I'm gonna do that.
[338:11.09]Yeah.
[338:11.75]I got this.
[338:12.15]It's in the bag.
[338:12.53]It's already.
[338:12.95]I win.
[338:18.14]Okay.
[338:32.09]Here comes.
[338:38.58]Had to do that.
[338:39.14]Everything's good.
[338:44.89]OK.
[338:44.95]This is where I go boom, boom, boom, three times, four times.
[339:21.42]One of you has to stop chewing here in a second, right?
[339:25.62]Alright.
[339:28.54]Here we go.
[339:28.96]Here we go.
[340:01.15]They'd really be crunching.
[340:03.65]Divert zombies into other lanes.
[340:07.82]Okay.
[340:12.88]Catapult zombie?
[340:16.48]What the hell does that mean?
[340:19.50]I got fucking garlic, dude.
[340:23.05]Alright.
[340:26.25]Just that.
[340:33.87]I'll try it.
[340:43.82]Diverse into other lanes, so it'll move up or down?
[340:46.78]Does it choose a path or do I have to pick it?
[340:55.29]Oh, he said it.
[340:55.69]He said the thing.
[340:58.71]It's random.
[341:14.77]Put them all the way at the end.
[341:26.23]Two tiers of double sun.
[341:27.70]I feel like I'm probably going to need that eventually, but not immediately.
[341:33.40]Maybe like the next three levels at the end of the game.
[341:48.53]Dude, you're totally gaming right now.
[341:50.69]Yeah.
[342:00.67]The garlic in the top and bottom row.
[342:05.27]Like all the way back here as a defense.
[342:06.83]Yeah.
[342:08.95]No.
[342:29.55]I have to eat it.
[342:30.25]Oh, shit.
[342:31.45]I'm gonna do three cabbage and then one corn.
[342:42.76]I think that'll be good.
[343:01.79]Are you winning, son?
[343:06.82]Yeah, Dad.
[343:10.44]Oh.
[343:34.43]I need three rows of cabbages, or I'll quit the game.
[343:38.76]It's what I require.
[343:40.72]Uh-oh.
[343:51.98]Is this stupid?
[343:58.13]Was it dumb to, like, tech this whole time just to get cabbages?
[344:00.48]Or is that... I think I'm alright.
[344:01.66]I don't know what this thing... What this guy does, though.
[344:05.24]I put... I'm gonna make... I'm gonna... What do I... Should I... Squish him.
[344:17.77]Found a solution.
[344:24.99]Kill him.
[344:25.25]Come on.
[344:32.13]He's not gonna kill my sunflowers, right?
[344:34.21]You are such a dick.
[344:37.15]I can't believe that.
[344:38.01]That was 150 bucks.
[344:43.25]That's actually bad.
[344:44.82]It's gonna set me behind.
[345:02.20]Okay, I got all the rows I want of cabbage.
[345:07.55]This is where I gotta get ready.
[345:08.99]I'm gonna do one row of corn, that's it.
[345:11.29]What's the difference?
[345:16.33]Corn does less damage than cabbage, but has a random chance to throw a big thing of butter, which stuns them like that.
[345:22.25]It's pretty useful.
[345:32.53]Can't even.
[345:33.41]Fuck you.
[345:35.14]Stun him!
[345:35.94]Stun him!
[345:36.74]Stun him!
[345:38.12]Stun him!
[345:38.90]Sorry.
[346:02.63]Not that bad.
[346:04.75]Could be worse.
[346:09.90]What are your thoughts on corn?
[346:48.27]Corn is really good.
[346:48.99]Yeah, it is.
[346:55.68]Ah, I see.
[346:58.70]Buys you a little time, too.
[346:59.74]Which is good.
[347:04.94]I'm gonna sneeze.
[347:08.01]I'm so sorry.
[347:08.51]I probably woke up like a thousand people.
[347:10.23]I'm sorry.
[347:11.47]There was no escaping that.
[347:12.61]It was just coming out.
[347:15.11]I tried to look away from the microphone too.
[347:16.75]This is supposed to be a chill night.
[347:19.99]I just probably scared the shit out of like a million of you.
[347:24.25]Sorry.
[347:26.65]Ooh.
[347:33.53]Okay.
[347:36.83]Protecting nearby plants, is that... Do they have to be touching?
[347:40.93]Or is it just in a square?
[347:42.39]Kind of adjacent squares?
[347:48.75]Is it 3x3?
[347:49.33]Okay.
[347:50.67]I'll try it.
[347:52.57]Order, come on.
[347:58.77]Mmm.
[348:19.31]Remember when he said stimulus?
[348:27.97]That was a little more put together though.
[348:29.71]That was not quite it.
[348:30.67]Alright, final three levels.
[348:46.81]Let's go.
[348:58.32]I didn't tech last time, and I think it was a problem.
[349:00.92]I'm gonna focus on that right now.
[349:02.01]We're doing double lane of flowers, by the way.
[349:08.49]Even if it ruins everything.
[349:09.43]Because I can kill this one, and I can kill that one, and then go forth from there.
[349:49.40]Yeah, now this is gonna be unbelievable.
[349:52.75]I'm gonna stack at least a few of these.
[349:54.09]And I'll be in the money.
[350:27.13]Look at this.
[350:27.43]This is gonna be awesome.
[350:29.35]It's gonna be good.
[350:38.71]Your economy's doing great right now?
[350:40.01]Thanks, dude.
[350:44.01]I'm trying.
[351:13.82]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[351:19.06]Okay.
[351:33.42]Come on, where's my economy?
[352:27.95]Nice placement.
[352:29.39]Look at all this money.
[352:32.47]It's just piling in right now.
[353:10.31]Die!
[353:10.55]Die!
[353:48.94]He's blowing it.
[353:49.94]No, I'm not.
[353:50.34]I'm good.
[353:51.58]I'm not blowing it.
[353:59.05]I didn't blow it.
[354:00.47]There's so much damage here.
[354:06.04]Look at this.
[354:06.34]An unbelievable amount of damage here.
[354:07.78]I'm doing fine.
[354:40.46]You need to optimize your strategy.
[354:42.66]Look it, no one's even getting close.
[354:46.86]No one's even come close.
[354:57.69]Look it, I got a thousand bucks.
[354:58.77]Go ahead, take it.
[355:00.51]What is that?
[355:02.25]Oh my god, it's a thousand dollars.
[355:03.81]Wait, why did I preemptively say that?
[355:07.75]Oh, because I had a thousand dollars, right?
[355:12.90]No, I want you to hit this guy.
[355:24.59]He must be pissed seeing that.
[355:27.24]Oh, what the fuck?
[355:44.30]more money than you can even count.
[355:46.04]I think I care.
[355:48.56]I've got $800.
[355:49.01]I don't care.
[355:52.19]Alright.
[355:58.51]Big wave coming.
[356:02.06]I don't think I need to do anything.
[356:17.62]You know what?
[356:17.92]Fuck it.
[356:23.59]This one, I don't even need it.
[356:31.16]Damage only.
[356:31.72]That was clean.
[356:33.70]Very clean.
[356:45.93]What would you be?
[356:46.63]Um... I don't like aloe vera.
[356:50.11]Uh-oh.
[356:51.73]Dude, you're dead.
[357:16.60]I don't think so.
[357:21.35]I'm happy with that strategy.
[357:22.27]I think it works fine.
[357:24.49]Smush.
[357:28.23]No, I gotta work on the economy first.
[357:29.62]Especially with a big guy like this.
[357:41.48]Hmm.
[357:45.95]Hmm.
[357:53.10]You would be a cactus.
[357:54.84]Probably, you're right.
[357:55.72]Alright, I think this is good.
[357:56.51]Let's go.
[358:03.67]Only one more level after this.
[358:04.67]Damn.
[358:06.15]Alright, we're going to beat this tonight.
[358:10.49]I feel like I've been playing pretty well.
[358:11.67]I feel like I've been pretty locked in.
[358:12.85]I don't think I've failed one mission.
[358:16.54]Maybe one?
[358:18.08]Look at this.
[358:25.61]Remember, economy.
[358:44.44]The restarts don't count?
[358:46.86]No, they do.
[358:50.30]Economy.
[358:52.82]I had a huge economy last time and it was the reason why I won.
[359:13.19]Come on.
[359:18.53]This game is really fun.
[359:21.11]Why didn't they just make more of these?
[359:22.47]I feel like there's so much more they could have probably done with this franchise in this way, not in the FPS way or the shooter way.
[359:31.22]I would have loved to have done like Plants vs. Zombies again.
[359:35.00]Yeah, I mean, Plants vs. Zombies 2 got a bunch of updates and stuff, but it was just a regular standalone game.
[359:47.78]Okay, let's go.
[359:49.26]Alright, time to go.
[359:56.26]There's not going to be any real rhyme or reason to the placement.
[360:03.96]People are going to be pissed about it, but it's okay.
[360:11.58]Just as they come up, I have a lot of money.
[360:13.36]It's coming up.
[360:21.33]Symmetry's gonna suck, but it's okay.
[360:23.72]Same damage, same stuff's happening.
[360:25.62]Just need to get it out there.
[360:28.22]Bottom row, come on.
[360:32.39]I gotta quickly get this built.
[360:54.21]Draw a dick with the pots.
[361:03.19]Have I just started doing that?
[361:05.84]No, I'm not going to do that.
[361:14.64]Get rid of him.
[361:15.92]Alright.
[361:23.01]First test.
[361:36.46]Okay, what is it?
[361:37.18]Not bad.
[361:37.88]Not a terrible wave.
[362:21.31]Oh shit.
[362:28.38]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on over here?
[362:35.91]Uh-oh.
[362:40.01]What?
[362:42.77]No.
[362:43.75]Okay, it's fine.
[362:44.53]Um.
[362:46.86]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[363:24.88]Nice.
[363:27.04]Put a dunce cap on.
[363:28.12]I saved that.
[363:29.86]No lawnmowers got hit there.
[363:31.97]What are you on about?
[363:35.71]What are you talking about?
[363:48.80]Holly can't sleep because Jeremiah keeps playing PVC at full volume at 1am.
[364:00.18]I'm being really quiet though.
[364:04.83]Okay, here it comes.
[364:12.83]Alright, wherever the big guy is, that's where I put this thing.
[364:19.91]There's a big guy down here.
[364:20.97]He squished it.
[364:38.96]He actually smushed it.
[364:39.80]Oh, my God.
[365:04.04]Come on, damn it.
[365:07.70]Die.
[365:08.76]Oh, no.
[365:12.70]Crash him.
[365:14.14]Yes.
[365:14.66]Okay.
[365:15.22]5-9 coming up.
[365:35.82]Watermelons?
[365:39.74]Heavy damage to groups of zombies.
[365:41.94]Should I just only do those?
[365:48.30]I think I'm just going to go ultra tech and only do watermelons.
[365:57.70]Watermelons and corn only.
[366:01.22]It's pretty pricey.
[366:06.72]That's what the coin's for.
[366:23.01]What am I doing?
[366:24.81]Of course.
[366:25.39]Okay, here we go.
[366:25.83]Let's go.
[366:31.84]This is it.
[366:32.18]I think there's only one more level after this, and it's like a minigame level, right?
[366:40.11]If I can make some money early, then this should work out fine.
[366:49.10]Yep, this is the original Plants vs Zombies.
[367:05.10]About the second one...
[367:07.75]It's the game of the year edition.
[367:09.15]I don't know what that they added anything or what that means Alright, come on first economy fun
[367:38.93]That doesn't mean anything.
[367:39.91]I didn't expect it to.
[367:51.90]Just more content.
[367:54.08]Will you play Zoombinis ever again?
[368:02.77]It's funny you say that.
[368:05.11]I think I have it installed right now.
[368:20.60]play it tonight we can play some beanies again if you want I'm down for that for sure not tonight but eventually alright we got a row of corn row of watermelon
[368:47.23]Come on, man.
[368:47.65]Look at that.
[368:48.77]Oh, yeah.
[368:50.17]Oh, there's no way they can buy.
[368:53.36]Remind me to protect the watermelons.
[368:56.04]Because I will forget.
[369:17.54]Need something down here.
[369:18.16]Before the big wave shows up.
[369:20.64]There we go.
[369:24.10]There we go.
[369:26.08]Nice.
[369:29.78]Okay.
[369:30.12]Not a bad spot.
[369:53.47]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[369:55.85]I need to get at least three here.
[369:57.05]There it is.
[370:00.42]Nice.
[370:00.58]Okay, right in the middle.
[370:04.88]I'm going to do another one.
[370:05.46]I'm going to do another row of corn.
[370:06.68]No.
[370:08.08]No, we're not.
[370:10.42]Only watermelons.
[370:48.48]There it is.
[370:49.78]Perfect.
[370:55.20]Another row of watermelons.
[370:57.48]I have a little bit of time.
[371:17.82]Protect them first.
[371:19.71]Uh, I will.
[371:23.65]Look at this economy back here.
[371:32.39]That's not happening.
[371:33.55]Sorry.
[371:48.58]Don't you dare.
[371:49.38]That took so long.
[371:51.72]Please.
[371:54.52]Shit.
[371:55.04]Right at the end.
[371:55.57]You piece of shit.
[371:56.43]Whatever.
[371:56.71]It's fine.
[371:57.11]Good luck getting over here.
[372:22.92]Alright, big wave.
[372:24.16]I need this.
[373:16.15]Okay, if I get two rows of watermelons, then it's game over.
[373:19.14]It just is.
[373:29.27]Getting watermelon launched at your head must really hurt.
[373:33.19]Yeah, big watermelons are... They can weigh a lot.
[373:49.21]Get him out of the way.
[373:54.53]Alright, getting there.
[374:03.45]Okay, that's it.
[374:05.31]That's it.
[374:05.61]No more upgrading.
[374:06.45]Jeez.
[374:06.75]Alright, good.
[374:43.84]Hey Dermot, can you crush a watermelon between your thighs?
[374:47.26]Uh, sorry.
[374:50.20]Sorry dude, I don't think that's happening.
[374:51.68]Alright, this is it!
[375:01.29]Come on!
[375:02.09]Fire!
[375:09.80]Launch!
[375:47.74]Die already.
[375:51.48]Come on, keep him frozen, keep him frozen.
[375:55.07]That luck.
[375:58.31]Oh shit.
[376:00.65]No!
[376:01.15]Come on, I'm not, my click speed isn't fast enough.
[376:11.60]Yes!

[376:15.56]Squashed with the clutch.

[376:42.00]Uh-oh, he's here.
[376:44.12]Better get ready.
[376:45.04]Gonna be one heck of a fight.
[376:47.92]His weakness is... Hit him in the pancreas.
[376:50.43]Dave!
[376:50.71]Uh-oh.
[377:16.57]It is Dave.
[377:22.11]Can I?
[377:22.39]Alright, here we go.
[377:28.42]It's the last level, right?
[377:37.83]Nope.
[377:38.15]Use it early.
[377:38.59]Use it early.
[377:39.79]Use it early so I can get a good, you know what I mean?
[377:42.31]Use it early.
[377:44.30]Watermelon going right in the middle.
[377:45.76]Perfect lane already.
[377:49.94]Not dealing with that.
[378:03.97]Not dealing with this right now.
[378:11.63]What the fuck?
[378:14.11]Do I attack him?
[378:15.29]Wait, freeze.
[378:20.24]Ooh, that hurts a lot.
[378:21.46]Okay.
[378:24.68]Um, what do I do about that?
[378:27.22]What the fuck do I do about that?
[378:30.70]What the fuck do I do about that?
[378:32.00]He just crushed everything.
[378:34.46]What?
[378:37.04]What the hell?
[378:37.42]He just rolled a fucking, like, blueberry snowball at me and it killed everything.
[378:42.89]What the hell happened?
[378:49.93]I need to use fire.
[378:51.49]Oh, that makes sense.
[379:15.49]Okay, I've got a pretty good thing here.
[379:16.89]Yeah, this works.
[379:30.00]Slowest clicker in the entire world, by the way.
[379:55.65]not putting up with that alright focus fire freeze what I need ice ice ice ice ice ice
[380:27.22]Now what?
[380:27.60]That's unfair.
[380:28.36]This is kind of a dick move.
[380:55.85]Fire, ice, cat.
[381:06.90]Almost halfway.
[381:10.70]Didn't take any watermelons.
[381:18.84]Good.
[381:22.69]I'm kind of running out of
[381:26.32]Wrong.
[381:29.36]But it was a waste, but it's OK.
[381:35.88]It's not a huge problem.
[381:41.42]That's OK, he should die right now.
[381:51.60]We got fire.
[382:04.43]Probably should just freeze him again.
[382:12.33]Hey!
[382:13.61]That was fucked up.
[382:16.87]That was annoying.
[382:19.03]What the?
[382:21.57]Freeze.
[382:34.80]I need some more shit.
[382:35.59]Dude, come on!
[382:38.13]Give me something besides the hot and the cold.
[382:44.44]Oh, Jesus.
[382:49.41]Uh...
[383:12.73]Okay, what are you gonna do?
[383:13.43]Ice?
[383:14.23]Fire?
[383:17.51]What is that?
[383:26.45]Is he gonna get... I feel like my teeth just came out.
[383:32.39]My fake teeth just came out of my mouth when I said that.
[383:39.27]My dentures just flew out.
[384:01.73]There's nobody even in this lane.
[384:03.15]Shit.
[384:04.33]Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.
[384:09.55]Oh, goodness.
[384:21.78]Oh, my God.
[384:22.86]I hope you don't.
[384:27.36]Oh, please don't do ice fire.
[384:36.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[384:42.45]Oh, I can't click correctly.
[384:45.07]I can't.
[384:49.24]I can't click correctly.
[384:50.98]I can't.
[384:52.70]I just, it's like, it's okay.
[385:02.66]I'm so close.
[385:17.45]Now, will this guy die already?
[385:24.32]This is the wrong lane, you dope!
[385:28.86]Alright, put your head down.
[386:15.33]Cool.
[386:19.99]$8,600.
[386:20.35]Cool.
[386:21.29]Okay, you win.
[386:27.45]No more eaten brains for us.
[386:30.43]We just want to make music video with you now.
[386:33.23]Sincerely, Zombies.
[386:37.76]Cool.
[386:38.68]I should probably turn this up.
[386:43.28]I don't think I can though.
[386:45.60]Let's be quiet.
[387:11.87]I used to play football.
[387:39.23]Like flashing me.
[388:12.72]That might be the worst enemy in the game.
[388:15.76]Probably the hardest to deal with at least.
[388:19.75]Playing it now.
[388:51.82]Oh, the cat jams.
[388:53.16]Oh, dancing.
[388:53.82]Cool.
[388:54.22]Hey, there it is.
[389:26.57]Oh, that was fun.
[389:30.19]I do real quickly want to see the minigame stuff.
[389:41.84]Yeah, that was cute.
[389:43.38]It's been a long time since I played it.
[389:45.53]It's actually been on the list for a while of just play this game.
[389:51.81]And I'm sitting there going, oh, how do I play Plants vs. Birds?
[389:53.89]How do I do that?
[389:56.31]But I think we just do what we did tonight.
[390:01.51]It's just hang out, play a game.
[390:15.59]Can you do more late night streams?
[390:19.75]You're going to see a lot more stuff like this this year.
[390:30.31]very cool game of the year content hmm cool alright minigames puzzles what's a minigame I'm curious oh oh what
[390:53.89]But if you guys like this, I'm happy you did.
[390:56.73]Because, I don't know, a lot of times when I'm thinking about what to do for a stream or something, it's like, oh, what's it going to be?
[391:05.10]It's going to be something fun or funny or crazy or wacky or... No, I don't think it has to be.
[391:11.46]I really don't think so.
[391:13.62]I think I'm changing my philosophy on what it means to kind of stream to Twitch and stuff.
[391:21.63]And...
[391:23.50]There's gonna be more of this shit.
[391:25.46]It's fun.
[391:28.06]What about what's happening right now?
[391:33.71]Wait, I need to actually get three?
[391:41.69]What if I don't get anything?
[391:45.65]Uh-huh.
[391:59.39]Can I get anything?
[392:09.34]This is kind of fucked up, I'm not going to lie.
[392:21.53]Okay, there we go.
[392:37.81]Dude, you suck at gambling.
[392:41.99]I'm trying as hard as I can.
[392:43.09]Oh my god, it's late.
[392:47.60]I just realized it's like almost 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific.
[392:50.02]What?
[392:50.76]I didn't know it was that late.
[392:53.36]There's still a lot of you here.
[392:56.48]Jesus.
[393:09.75]A lot of people probably fell asleep.
[393:18.84]Oh, here we go again.
[393:26.70]Eastern time.
[393:27.30]Almost 5 a.m.
[393:30.00]Eastern.
[393:35.32]The late night crowd is usually pretty chill from what I've seen.
[394:00.11]I'm surprised I'm still doing fine here.
[394:12.47]Do you still get up before noon?
[394:17.05]Yeah.
[394:20.60]I've been starting my day around like 9?
[394:23.10]9.30?
[394:23.12]10?
[394:23.98]The last probably couple years.
[394:29.30]At least the last year.
[394:32.95]Uh-oh.
[394:33.51]Uh-oh.
[394:34.15]Why?
[394:35.13]Uh-oh.
[394:35.85]Alright, what else I got?
[394:36.99]That's pretty cool.
[394:42.23]Some botany?
[394:46.27]Classic walnut bowling.
[395:13.64]Jesus.
[395:15.22]Click on the right spot, please.
[395:17.14]Okay, I gotta leave.
[395:18.60]I was trying to click here.
[395:20.70]Oops.
[395:31.34]It's fine.
[395:32.00]I got enough.
[395:53.33]I tried to do it again.
[395:56.33]See, look at, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look where my finger is.
[395:59.16]Look, look, look, look at that.

[396:02.34]Look at that.
[396:02.92]See?
[396:03.70]That's in the square down here.
[396:05.56]That's in that bottom square.
[396:07.26]Okay.
[396:22.50]This is actually really fun.
[396:23.56]I can see why people like this game mode.
[396:27.23]That didn't hit?
[396:29.83]Weird.
[396:57.73]Shit.
[396:58.11]Get the cat, you have a lot of money.
[397:02.57]Uh oh.
[397:41.85]I think that's where I lose.
[397:47.42]Explosive.
[397:52.72]Oh.
[397:54.72]Not quite.
[397:55.16]I feel like I'm playing Dr. Mario or something or Tetris.
[398:02.13]I hate this.
[398:03.89]I don't hate this.
[398:04.49]I just hate that feeling.
[398:08.81]Oh, it's over.
[398:16.76]Actually, if I get a bomb, I'll be fine.
[398:57.83]shit I thought I could get out in time okay is it rng I haven't seen a bomb in like in at least two hours where are the bombs where are the bombs
[399:26.33]There really hasn't been a bomb at all.
[399:29.01]Look at all this junk here.
[399:30.07]How am I supposed to hit this?
[399:31.73]I need a bomb.
[399:38.76]You have to save the... Ooh, a present.
[399:40.38]It's over.
[399:56.26]Well, maybe not.
[399:59.35]Hold on.
[399:59.85]Thanks for the bombs.
[400:13.16]Finally.
[400:13.58]Alright.
[400:14.40]This has to go right there.
[400:15.22]That didn't do anything.
[400:17.42]What?
[400:17.60]That hit two people.
[400:20.92]That hit two people?
[400:24.23]There's 10 people standing here.
[400:27.05]What?
[400:29.87]OK.
[400:29.99]Yes, this is GG here.
[400:32.71]Yeah, it's still fun.
[400:34.24]Unless I get some insane luck right now.
[401:01.70]Nope.
[401:03.25]Nope.
[401:10.51]Nope.
[401:13.34]Close.
[401:14.92]I think I spammed him too much in the beginning.
[401:24.61]Alright, let's go.
[401:30.04]Looks like there's space for way more of these.
[401:31.78]That's a lot.
[401:35.02]What is this?
[401:39.08]Oh, yeah.
[401:39.86]I don't want to do this one.
[401:41.10]Yeah, no.
[401:41.70]No, thank you.
[401:43.43]They attack back.
[401:44.81]No.
[401:47.17]That's too hard.
[401:53.87]Oh, I don't have enough.
[401:56.85]Alright.
[401:57.75]I'm going to call it here.
[402:00.41]Thanks for hanging out.
[402:07.65]We'll see you again the next time I'm going to stream.
[402:09.58]I planned on streaming on Thursday.
[402:11.84]We'll see.
[402:15.82]If not Thursday, then maybe... Because Ster and I are going to do Saturday-Sunday with Elden Ring Randomizer co-op again.
[402:24.54]So just keep an eye on the sus.
[402:26.12]If you don't see anything in the next few days, the next two days, then expect everything on Saturday, Sunday.
[402:33.98]I might just show up and do what I did tonight.
[402:39.35]I was really actually... If you want me to be real, I was kind of going, how are people going to react to this stream?
[402:46.99]I didn't know if people were going to be like, you know, this is...
[402:52.15]I don't know.
[402:52.47]I don't like this or something.
[402:54.65]So I'm glad that people seem to have a good time.
[403:00.60]So that's great.
[403:01.16]I'm glad to see that because that means I'm going to do way more of them.
[403:06.65]Get hydrated.
[403:07.19]I've been drinking tea.
[403:08.67]I had some water a little bit earlier too when I went downstairs.
[403:18.51]It was chill.
[403:19.57]Good.
[403:20.63]Why do you what are you so worried about?
[403:37.43]Would be terrible.
[403:38.29]Would be terrible to have a random stream on Friday, my birthday.
[403:46.38]You didn't even type mustache.
[403:47.92]No, I didn't.
[403:55.48]I really didn't.
[403:57.86]That's okay.
[404:01.72]Any news on Grotto Beasts?
[404:02.74]I actually talked a lot about it earlier at the beginning of the stream.
[404:05.62]The first hour or two.
[404:11.82]It gives them all mustaches.
[404:15.70]Yeah, keep an eye on the sauce.
[404:16.62]I'll see you this weekend.
[404:19.38]Guaranteed.
[404:22.46]And then maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll show up again before this weekend.
[404:26.06]If not, then expect Saturday, Sunday.
[404:29.26]Good old Ster.
[404:31.28]Or Elden Ring.
