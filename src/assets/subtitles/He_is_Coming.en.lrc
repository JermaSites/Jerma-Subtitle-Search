[ve:61.1.100]

[00:32.79]Good morning.
[00:33.53]If only one for one day only, that's right.
[00:44.86]For one day only.
[00:50.74]We're back.
[00:55.07]What's wrong with you?
[00:55.79]It's noon.
[00:56.63]Well, it's actually 9 AM.
[01:00.69]Starting early today.
[01:03.36]And the reason for that is twofold.
[01:05.99]Number one, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
[01:14.91]Scheduling.
[01:15.51]We've been scheduling.
[01:17.58]And it turns out that this morning is the best time for all of us to do anything.
[01:24.30]What was asked in that little chat over there was, hey, who can do this?
[01:28.77]And I was the one that blew up the last one.
[01:32.74]Because I was like, oh, I can't.
[01:34.20]I can't do it.
[01:34.71]I can't.
[01:36.41]So we moved it.
[01:39.19]We've been talking.
[01:41.67]And turns out this morning is the perfect time.
[01:47.42]I think it's not for like another hour or two.
[01:51.33]So I think we're going to chill for a little bit.
[01:53.73]I want to play Vinny.
[01:54.75]Speaking of Horseman, Vinny mentioned this game.
[02:00.57]Last time we played a couple weeks ago.
[02:04.43]It's called he is.
[02:05.81]Humming.
[02:09.98]He is on his way.
[02:11.38]I kind of just play it.
[02:15.68]Just going to poke around with it for like an hour hour or two until everybody's around and then we're going to play Michael Punk.
[02:24.23]We've been planning on playing that for awhile.
[02:26.42]That game looks kind of crazy.
[02:29.75]And we might play that for a while.
[02:31.17]I don't know.
[02:31.79]We'll see how long that goes.
[02:32.93]And then my plan is maybe the stream hasn't gone for too too long.
[02:38.11]That we will train the remainder of the crew.
[02:42.24]The what I do crew.
[02:45.26]For the Monster Rancher tournament.
[02:49.05]That's kind of a packed up day today.
[02:53.25]But ads are going to start.
[02:54.43]I'll be right back.
[02:55.81]We'll get rid of the pre-rolls.
[02:57.09]You know the drill.
[02:59.67]I'll be back in two or three minutes to start.
[03:02.33]See you in a minute.
[04:25.26]I just sat back down.
[04:30.14]Alright, game is up.
[04:30.88]Let me see.
[04:32.22]Let me do my settings.
[04:34.65]They look fine.
[04:38.27]The tags are even funnier now that he specifically asked for its removal.
[04:45.64]I'm just saying, but we got a low capture rate on those tags.
[04:47.88]We figured that out last night.
[04:56.07]You gonna play Destiny 2?
[04:59.31]Uh, no.
[05:06.00]Didn't some of the people that are working on Destiny 2 say that they're kind of sad because they've added so much content to the game that new players physically can't even experience the game because they added too much stuff?
[05:29.58]Yeah, they messed it all up.
[05:35.17]They removed half of it and made it worse.
[05:39.16]They deleted all the old stuff.
[05:45.40]They deleted an entire DLC's worth of content.
[05:48.61]That's so crazy to think about that.
[05:51.73]Like, you've made so many expansions.
[05:53.65]World of Warcraft had this problem too, but they had an interesting way to fix it.
[05:58.24]In Retail WoW, you can go back and just activate an expansion.
[06:07.01]And it's like, okay, hey, let me tell you something.
[06:08.95]You are scaled crazy here.
[06:11.88]But you can go play in Outlands if you want.
[06:15.30]We're just going to scale the game to whatever level you are.
[06:17.86]Go ahead and enjoy it.
[06:18.79]You can be like level 8.
[06:20.49]Who cares?
[06:20.95]I guess when you make so much content, what do you do with it?
[06:31.31]How many expansions does Destiny 2 have?
[06:33.56]10?
[06:45.01]At least 3.
[06:46.39]Well, that's definitely more than 3.
[06:51.30]There's 12.
[06:53.38]There's 10.
[06:54.32]12.
[06:54.58]12 expansions.
[07:02.33]That's that's crazy.
[07:08.42]More than half of them are vaulted.
[07:11.34]Does that mean that does that?
[07:12.42]What does that mean?
[07:12.98]What does vaulted mean?
[07:13.92]12 and two story DLC's.
[07:23.20]Yeah, I gotta be honest when I think about playing a game like Destiny 2, it's I feel the same way about one piece.
[07:29.94]Hey, are you going to watch One Piece?
[07:31.12]That's like 3,000 episodes of TV.
[07:33.56]No, I'm not going to.
[07:35.28]I don't think so.
[07:46.07]If there's like two decades worth of content and you got to go through it, I don't know.
[07:52.14]I don't know if I would want to do that.
[07:53.64]Maybe I would.
[07:54.28]I guess it's...
[07:57.93]I'm telling you, I think the retail wow way is the way to do it.
[08:02.50]Have a goofy little character that's like, oh, hello there.
[08:05.20]Would you like to go back in time and play this?
[08:07.22]It's going to be a piece of shit, but like you can do it.
[08:10.98]I think that's the way to do it.
[08:20.73]They're doing a remade, shortened, reanimated series.
[08:24.80]To make it more watchable.
[08:26.42]I don't think it's not watchable.
[08:32.39]I just think that if you're going to watch the whole thing, it's a commitment, right?
[08:38.14]Just because One Piece has a thousand episodes or whatever doesn't mean I don't think it's not watchable.
[08:43.71]I just don't have the commitment process to start at one.
[08:58.43]Once you get into it, you'll get sucked in.
[09:01.93]Yeah, I... Well, here's the thing.
[09:05.78]Here's how the story goes.
[09:08.37]You'll find out as I tell it.
[09:11.07]About that... This... The treasure... There's a grand line.
[09:15.28]There's no doubt about this, by the way.
[09:17.72]Absolutely no doubt in your mind.
[09:19.33]In my mind, either.
[09:21.78]Uh, it'll be singing.
[09:23.53]There's pirates that sing.
[09:24.67]Uh, it'll be king of the pirates.
[09:28.11]Um, the king is somebody that when they get crowned, they rule.
[09:31.56]Um, he's gonna be king, I think.
[09:34.78]Yeah, yo.
[09:36.46]Yeah, yo.
[09:45.52]Alright, let's play this game.
[09:47.90]Those of you that know, you know.
[09:49.12]Those of you that don't know...
[09:51.31]Don't give it up.
[09:53.62]Hey, no, actually, why don't you give it up?
[10:01.51]How many people in here even, like, care about what I just said?
[10:08.44]Alright, let's play.
[10:09.12]This is called He Is Coming.
[10:11.20]And he sure certainly is.
[10:14.30]By the way, we have a problem.
[10:16.81]A big problem.
[10:18.99]There is a mosquito, I think, in the room.
[10:24.44]And I am ready to fight.
[10:28.82]I manifested this thing.
[10:30.98]I heard the buzzing.
[10:31.94]I saw him flying around.
[10:33.14]It had that little mosquito body.
[10:35.77]We don't get mosquitoes in Vegas.
[10:38.81]What is going on here?
[10:42.05]I'm ready to... I'm ready for total Mortal Kombat right now.
[10:46.14]Alright, long ago in an age lost to time, mortals and demons waged war against each other.
[10:50.17]At the heart of their conflict was the crown, a magical artifact.
[10:56.32]When the crown fell into the hands of the Demon King, darkness spread across the land, and the people suffered under his reign.
[11:05.85]I'm quick, too.
[11:07.19]I can do it quick.
[11:08.66]If I hear that... I will... I can hurt myself.
[11:13.13]You know what I mean?
[11:14.71]That my hand is smashing, clasping my face and hair and ears, I'm gonna get it.
[11:27.96]I would rather have a slap mark on my face and get it, or smack my ear and deal with that, than know there's a mosquito in this room that could bite me at any moment that will bite me.
[11:42.73]I would rather slap myself in the face hard.
[11:49.02]I didn't even read the rest of this.
[11:59.97]What if you shake your head and 20 mosquitoes come out?
[12:02.13]Alright, this is game... Vinny recommended this game.
[12:04.22]He said it was pretty good.
[12:05.64]And it looks kind of good.
[12:07.90]Let me turn it up a little bit on my end.
[12:10.91]Alright, so I have to... I move around.
[12:12.53]Apparently you have a day.
[12:15.38]You have one day before a monster comes and gets you.
[12:18.16]What do I have?
[12:18.50]I got a stick.
[12:22.11]Is it arrow keys?
[12:23.71]It is arrow keys.
[12:24.67]Is it controller?
[12:25.74]That would be sick if it was.
[12:27.32]Okay, it's controller.
[12:29.44]We'll do controller.
[12:32.59]Move this out of the way and turn this around.
[12:34.91]Alright, hopefully I'm not making a mistake.
[12:36.07]I think every time you move... Let's go get the treasure.
[12:43.13]Alright, what do we got?
[12:43.75]We got Razorthorn Spear.
[12:46.49]Two thorns on hit.
[12:48.96]Boots.
[12:50.54]Or wet stone.
[12:53.36]It's on Steam.
[12:56.98]Why did you spin around in your chair when you said that?
[13:00.23]Because I'm having fun!
[13:03.43]What, I can't have fun?
[13:04.41]I can't spin around?
[13:06.95]Uh, how much damage does this do?
[13:08.30]One?
[13:09.58]Maybe I should take the weapon.
[13:12.06]Alright, I'm taking the weapon.
[13:15.05]Deal damage equal to your thorns when struck.
[13:19.11]Then, okay.
[13:19.85]So, I gave myself thorns.
[13:23.30]Alright, I'm gonna go up.
[13:24.00]Alright, there's a monster over there.
[13:28.55]What is R1?
[13:29.17]Oh, wait.
[13:30.79]Razor Tusk Hog, I think, is the thing chasing me.
[13:34.32]If Razor Tusk Hog has more speed than you, his first strike deals 10 additional damage.
[13:38.61]Oh, that's not good.
[13:43.26]Should I fight this?
[13:44.68]Alright, I'm gonna fight this.
[13:45.38]Hopefully he doesn't kill me.
[13:49.23]Alright, battles resolve automatically.
[13:51.17]You and your opponent take turns attacking each other.
[13:53.03]If your health reaches zero, you lose.
[13:55.30]Cool.
[13:56.98]That's how much damage you deal.
[13:58.20]And that's how much damage you absorb.
[14:01.10]Okay.
[14:05.31]And speed is who goes first, so I have zero speed.
[14:08.89]Uh, I can adjust the speed.
[14:11.16]Uh, let's just do regular.
[14:15.86]Alright, so I don't have thorns.
[14:17.81]He should take two damage, right?
[14:26.82]Alright, that thing's actually... I'm glad I did that.
[14:32.67]I feel like this game is going to be sick.
[14:34.43]You know what I mean?
[14:35.31]This feels like a good one.
[14:38.82]Somebody in chat called this a Nightreign clone.
[14:43.34]Uh... What?
[14:45.44]I mean, I... We have to hold your judgment on that.
[14:52.03]I need defense.
[14:52.87]I'm taking the vest.
[14:54.81]I need... How much speed does he have?
[14:56.25]Okay, he has four speed.
[14:57.41]I need to make sure I have five speed.
[14:59.82]Or at least four speed, or he's gonna kill me in one hit.
[15:02.90]This is the guy coming over here in the top right.
[15:04.90]That's the guy that's coming.
[15:06.52]He is coming.
[15:07.77]Is the name of the game.
[15:09.75]Relax.
[15:12.35]Do I fight this bear?
[15:15.84]What if I die?
[15:18.00]I'll do it.
[15:22.57]Oh shit, he gets attack while I have armor.
[15:27.39]Uh, that hurt a lot.
[15:34.04]Okay, how do you heal?
[15:35.16]I need health potions!
[15:38.58]I'm gonna die!
[15:43.48]Oh, here we go, okay.
[15:46.95]Exposed.
[15:47.93]Triggers when you lose all of your armor for the first time.
[15:51.41]You can lose armor?
[15:56.56]If you're able to capture the mosquito, don't kill it and suck its blood.
[16:00.09]How disgusting is that?
[16:01.98]You know how many people's blood could be in that mosquito?
[16:04.10]I don't want to do that.
[16:07.07]You know what the worst thing in the world is?
[16:09.65]I know we're getting gross and we've been gross since last night.
[16:12.72]When you kill a mosquito, if a mosquito lands on you, you're like, get it!
[16:16.97]And then you have blood on your arm.
[16:20.53]What goes through my mind is how many mixture of DNA of people's blood is inside of this thing's stomach right now.
[16:29.10]That mosquito could have bitten somebody in Cincinnati.
[16:33.50]and made it all the way over to your county.
[16:36.75]And you've got somebody, you've got like Dave's blood on your arm from fucking like Milwaukee on you.
[16:42.37]What?
[16:42.81]No, thank you.
[16:47.87]Yeah, I know that that's not how it works.
[16:49.90]I'm just saying.
[16:51.14]I'm giving an outlandish example of what I'm talking about.
[16:55.87]I know that they're not going to migrate from Milwaukee to Vegas.
[16:59.23]And they're going to eat that.
[17:00.52]They'll digest it.
[17:01.56]They'll shit it out.
[17:02.62]I get it.
[17:03.00]But still, the point still stands.
[17:09.77]If your health is not full... Ooh, that's good.
[17:13.25]I need that.
[17:14.66]Okay.
[17:16.44]Left or right?
[17:17.40]Where does he come from?
[17:20.84]Fuck.
[17:20.96]I don't think I want to fight either one of these right now.
[17:23.63]What if I go this way?
[17:25.55]Is backtracking bad?
[17:26.45]Ooh, what's this?
[17:29.39]Checkpoint?
[17:31.25]Sleep until the next day and restore 10 health.
[17:34.50]Oh!
[17:35.16]Yes.
[17:36.40]Okay, when you sleep, he... comes... he walks faster.
[17:44.20]You're delusional.
[17:45.90]YOU'RE delusional!
[17:51.93]Alright, full health.
[17:56.03]Okay, so the armor is effectively just extra health.
[17:58.74]It's just like a health over buff.
[18:01.16]Because it's gone now.
[18:06.64]Alright, that's good.
[18:09.45]If you sleep, you lose the entire night to get stronger.
[18:15.20]Alright, that bat wasn't that bad.
[18:16.74]I don't know what that is, but there's items over here.
[18:22.21]There we go.
[18:23.97]Hey, can you please FaceTime my son?
[18:28.68]I mean, my cameo is $1,000 per 30 seconds.
[18:35.38]And it's only birthday and birthday, anniversary, or graduations.
[18:41.51]I don't do anything else.
[18:44.73]And yeah, I've gotten criticisms, and I'll address it, I've gotten a lot of criticism.
[18:48.84]Of, hey dude, we were suspicious of this, so me and my friend both bought your graduation cameo thing.
[18:58.21]And you just said the same exact thing, your eyes were going across the screen reading the same sentences.
[19:05.61]And you just replaced our names with each other's names.
[19:10.44]And they found it to be annoying, but what I said is, look, you're paying for the likeness.
[19:14.72]You're paying for the likeness, and I'm sorry.
[19:17.06]That's what you're getting.
[19:19.75]That's what the brand is worth.
[19:26.96]Why are you stalling?
[19:27.94]I'm not stalling!
[19:28.98]I'm just talking!
[19:30.90]Alright, so I got a checkpoint here.
[19:36.43]That website... Yeah, I think the website is... Is that website still up?
[19:39.08]Where you could, uh... Just put your name in and it'll be... I'll do anything?
[19:44.47]I forgot about that.
[19:45.63]That was, like, years ago.
[19:54.95]Ah, I want speed.
[19:56.13]Don't want that.
[19:58.73]There we go.
[19:59.93]Wait, can you have more than one vest on?
[20:02.68]Or will this replace the vest I have on right now?
[20:05.98]Can I, like, double up the clothes like it's pulled outside?
[20:08.68]Okay, you can.
[20:11.43]That's cool.
[20:12.05]Alright, I need two more speed.
[20:15.57]Hold on this way.
[20:23.00]Ooh!
[20:24.32]After three strikes, lose two attack.
[20:26.29]Wait, it's four attack.
[20:31.19]Is that better than the thorns?
[20:32.44]I feel like it is.
[20:33.78]Taking it.
[20:37.40]Why are you so smug?
[20:40.67]Um, we just make believe, man.
[20:41.99]We just make him believe.
[20:47.58]When is the Thanksgiving family dinner part two?
[20:50.95]That can't ever have a part two.
[20:53.77]Don't you understand?
[20:56.20]Having a part two of that, it absolutely just... It makes the original.
[21:04.55]No.
[21:05.87]Then you're talking about it, you know.
[21:09.09]What's the word I'm looking for here?
[21:13.14]Dilute.
[21:14.56]You dilute the first one.
[21:15.92]I don't want to dilute the first one.
[21:21.92]This should kill him in one shot, right?
[21:29.69]There we go.
[21:33.40]You're the type of guy to do a handstand?
[21:34.92]No, not really.
[21:42.87]Okay, should I do- I'm gonna do more- no.
[21:47.05]This is just a permanent.
[21:48.11]Every time you hit something, you just get an extra health.
[21:51.49]Or just damage, damage, damage.
[21:55.48]I'll take the damage then.
[21:56.96]Okay, so this does five damage a hit now.
[21:59.68]I think I'm gonna beat him.
[22:01.08]How much health does he have?
[22:01.88]He's got five health!
[22:02.67]I'm gonna kill him in one hit!
[22:05.25]He's got no armor.
[22:06.99]Wait, he's gonna do ten damage to me.
[22:08.77]Okay.
[22:09.61]As long as I have twelve damage, I should be fine.
[22:11.73]Or twelve health.
[22:15.22]What is that?
[22:17.58]Transform into an item, or transform an item into another item of the same rarity.
[22:24.61]I don't think I want to do that.
[22:26.33]I think I'm good.
[22:30.70]I'm not going to use that campfire over there.
[22:33.08]Let's go kill this, what is this, hog or whatever it is.
[22:41.15]We're good.
[22:43.95]It's 10 additional on top of his 4.
[22:46.70]Oh, shit.
[22:48.64]Okay, I need... Uh-oh.
[22:52.83]Am I screwed?
[22:57.76]Oh, he's coming.
[23:00.57]He's coming.
[23:04.61]Steal gold?
[23:06.26]No, kill him.
[23:09.81]Is there a shop or something I can buy stuff from?
[23:12.05]I need more gear.
[23:12.71]I need a chest right now.
[23:23.46]I swear to God, I thought I heard the mosquito.
[23:27.17]Okay, if you... I just wanted to give a warning here.
[23:28.95]If you randomly hear an explosion of stuff falling down and breaking and stuff, I got him.
[23:35.20]But I'm probably gonna have to replace some equipment.
[23:36.88]You know what I mean?
[23:42.39]Alright, what is this?
[23:45.25]Ahhhh.
[23:46.46]Okay, that thing right there, that looks like a big gem chest or something.
[23:50.22]Should I go for it?
[24:04.72]A jewelry box.
[24:07.82]Um... Too late for this.
[24:13.59]okay hold on a second this will give me I think I think this is good this will do it right because I'll have 10 health but I'll have nine armor this is good item slots are numbered and will trigger sequentially this means the item in slot one will trigger before the item in slot two okay let me take a look here
[24:43.92]That's at battle start.
[24:46.26]Okay, none of these matter what order they're in.
[24:48.98]So I can take one hit from the hog.
[24:52.17]And I should kill him in one hit.
[24:58.72]I don't want to get hurt.
[25:00.24]I don't know how much... Is the spider bad?
[25:05.65]No, that's stupid.
[25:06.49]I'm going to go down here.
[25:07.61]The hog was easier, right?
[25:10.97]Um, should I just kill time until he comes?
[25:13.99]I'm gonna do that, I think.
[25:16.39]There's a checkpoint right here, too.
[25:20.12]Ooh!
[25:24.26]Alright, I'll be ready.
[25:25.46]I got a campfire right here.
[25:33.21]Alright, here it comes.
[25:34.21]Maybe I shouldn't use this.
[25:37.26]I don't think I need to use this right now.
[25:38.26]I have a full everything.
[25:40.04]Should I just bait him...
[25:45.09]Uh-oh, somebody else is coming.
[25:59.68]There he is, okay.
[26:04.26]Okay, if Razortest Hog is more speed than you, which he does, he's going to hit me for 14 damage.
[26:12.19]But I should be able to eat it.
[26:13.73]So let's go.
[26:14.85]And I'll kill him in one hit.
[26:17.63]Ouch.
[26:24.28]Okay.
[26:25.70]Got him.
[26:30.13]I'm glad I didn't touch this, because I need it.
[26:33.94]A stag.
[26:35.70]Strikes three times per turn.
[26:38.67]Got ten health.
[26:39.37]He's gonna do nine damage per swing.
[26:40.97]He's got ten armor, too.
[26:42.41]Okay.
[26:47.88]Wait, why can I use this?
[26:48.96]Can I only use this at night?
[26:51.49]Oh, shit.
[26:51.93]I think I can only use that at night.
[26:57.40]Combine two of the same common or golden item.
[27:02.54]Oh!
[27:04.59]What's that gonna do?
[27:09.53]That's sick.
[27:10.19]Okay, so... Alright, this game's pretty good.
[27:13.26]This is a cool game.
[27:13.86]I like it.
[27:14.38]And now I have more slots and stuff.
[27:16.68]This is a cool game.
[27:19.43]Okay.
[27:22.19]I don't wanna lose, so... What do I do with money?
[27:25.49]Go this way.
[27:29.30]What's that?
[27:31.10]Reveal a location of interest.
[27:34.54]Um... I don't know what these two are.
[27:44.13]This is to upgrade the weapon again, but I feel like I want... What are these?
[27:49.02]It's oil and a shop.
[27:50.94]I kind of want to see where a shop is.
[27:52.10]I have money.
[27:55.01]I'm imagining this is the shop.
[27:58.05]Okay, that's right there.
[28:01.74]Oh, give me that.
[28:04.90]Sleep until the next day?
[28:11.15]Okay, I get it.
[28:14.59]Shit.
[28:14.97]Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[28:22.24]I got a ton of armor now, though.
[28:28.65]Why are you awake at this hour?
[28:30.67]We got a, uh... We got some Four Horsemen stuff coming up in like 30 minutes.
[28:35.83]Okay, temporarily gains two attack.
[28:45.53]How long does this last though, just one turn?
[28:53.60]That's good.
[28:57.18]Healing Potion or... the Whetstone?
[29:04.32]You can't have two weapons at the same time, right?
[29:13.36]Are you fitting this all in last minute?
[29:14.91]No, we've been talking about this for like a couple days.
[29:19.51]I'm gonna take this.
[29:20.09]I feel like it's gonna be more helpful.
[29:29.34]Yeah!
[29:31.70]Okay, I want that treasure.
[29:35.15]It's cool they move at night.
[29:40.07]What are you guys gonna play?
[29:40.79]We're gonna play Mycopunk.
[29:45.98]That's the plan.
[29:53.49]I don't think I... I don't think I have anything that's rare.
[30:00.42]No, I don't... That's a cool thing, but I don't need it.
[30:05.84]Alright, two speed.
[30:06.80]Alright, what, what, what, look, he's almost here.
[30:10.49]He's coming right now.
[30:12.47]He's got a shitload of health.
[30:13.49]He has effectively 20 HP.
[30:18.00]I don't, I won't last if he swings.
[30:24.93]Okay, if he attacks, three, that's it.
[30:27.92]Okay, I can take two turns of him attacking me.
[30:31.78]But I'm only going to be doing ten damage after those, I think I'm going to die.
[30:42.11]I mean, that's kind of huge.
[30:44.81]Do I get max HP?
[30:49.92]Maybe, I don't know.
[30:50.54]Should I take the... I think I want the health.
[31:00.26]Okay, now let's hope that whatever's at the shop is going to save my life.
[31:15.81]okay 12. but there's a campfire right here that should be fine alright what does he got you have zero base armor restore health to full okay well that's not the case I have too much armor if you have armor gain additional armor it's only gonna be one
[31:42.37]Okay, whenever you restore health, you get one additional health, which I have the potion.
[31:46.03]Which, that's not a whole lot, though.
[31:48.39]Is this every turn?
[31:50.55]Oh, it is every turn.
[31:52.02]Okay, that's kind of huge.
[31:59.16]How much speed do I have?
[32:00.02]That's not going to happen.
[32:05.15]Although, wait.
[32:11.49]That's good, too.
[32:15.24]Okay, I know for a fact as if I'm taking the gloves.
[32:19.47]Can I only buy one item?
[32:21.63]Oh, I can buy more than one item!
[32:36.23]That's... I'm gonna do that.
[32:39.34]What do I... can I sell?
[32:43.84]That's cool, but... Convert 3 speed to 9 armor.
[32:54.15]I don't have 3 speed.
[33:02.36]Is this something I can just get rid of?
[33:07.11]I mean, that's good.
[33:08.11]I feel like, I don't know.
[33:09.33]Should I just... Should I live with it?
[33:12.25]I think this is going to keep me alive.
[33:15.58]Give her the potion.
[33:17.95]I feel like that's gonna come in the clutch and save me, though.
[33:23.78]I'm not a math guy, but he's going to take me down to 50% on the first swing.
[33:32.99]I need a different weapon.
[33:37.38]Oh, shit.
[33:38.46]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[33:41.66]No, the thing's good, but... It's gonna be four atta- It's five damage, but I'm gonna have to attack him more than twice.
[33:58.78]Uh... I could reroll again.
[34:01.54]Dammit.
[34:10.80]How much is this?
[34:11.58]Ten?
[34:12.84]Shit!
[34:16.06]It's alright.
[34:17.49]It's alright, I think I'll be fine.
[34:18.51]I have to sleep in the bed.
[34:20.29]I made the bed, right?
[34:24.03]You have no armor, no.
[34:27.91]Give yourself and the enemy five freezes.
[34:34.78]This is good.
[34:36.90]Your attack is halved as long as you have freeze stacks.
[34:41.04]So he's going to swing three times, three, six, nine.
[34:42.90]He'll only do three damage.
[34:46.85]Maybe this is the way to do it.
[34:47.75]Maybe I should get rid of something.
[34:48.97]Maybe I get rid of the potion for this.
[34:51.17]Because he'll only hit me for three.
[34:55.94]But you'll also have it too.
[34:57.98]So that'll be, I'll be doing what?
[34:59.31]Two and a half damage a swing?
[35:02.01]He has 20 health?
[35:05.21]I'll take him down to 50%.
[35:06.27]Nah, it's not going to be helpful.
[35:19.01]It'll kill your good for the first three hits.
[35:24.29]I think I'm good.
[35:25.06]I think I'm good.
[35:25.58]What's gonna go?
[35:27.66]I think I'm good to go.
[35:33.85]Maybe... Okay.
[35:36.35]I'm good to go.
[35:39.25]I got a campfire right here.
[35:40.33]I'll probably find a treasure or something.
[35:42.44]I'll get, like, something else.
[35:46.76]Yep.
[35:47.56]Yep.
[35:50.65]Uh, is that better?
[35:56.19]Maybe I should just take this.
[36:06.71]Should I take this?
[36:11.87]I upgraded this thing though.
[36:13.45]No?
[36:22.15]Ditch the cloak for the shield.
[36:25.82]Or ditch the cloak for the helmet.
[36:36.21]Or ditch the potion for the... helmet.
[36:41.62]Yeah, ditch the potion for the helmet.
[36:42.92]Because the helmet's going to do what the potion's doing anyways.
[36:46.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:49.07]How do I get rid of it?
[36:55.13]Can I sell it or something?
[36:56.63]Delete it?
[37:02.72]Oh, okay.
[37:04.92]I think that's the right idea, because I'm going to take the heal at half health anyways, so I might as well just have armor and health on it.
[37:17.91]Alright, campfire's right there.
[37:19.00]I should be able to kill, get this, and then go up.
[37:29.44]You saw Ster play this?
[37:31.80]Am I the third friend to play it?
[37:34.22]I wanted to be the second friend to play it.
[37:36.76]After Vinny's recommendation.
[37:38.51]Dammit.
[37:40.33]I'm the third friend to play it?
[37:42.23]Great.
[37:56.23]Nah.
[37:58.36]Hey, here's what sucks.
[37:59.58]I could have got the shield back there, got this shield, and combined them, and had six.
[38:08.85]Nah.
[38:10.39]Alright, I gotta go up, and we're ready for the battle.
[38:16.16]Come on... I want full health for this fight.
[38:23.23]Alright, here we go.
[38:24.55]He strikes three times.
[38:27.08]He's gonna hit me for... nine.
[38:30.86]I should absorb it all, and I should whack him.
[38:40.33]Okay.
[38:41.57]Alright, bros.
[38:43.31]Listen up.
[38:44.62]He's gonna do it again.
[38:46.18]And I think I lose.
[38:55.31]I'm good.
[38:58.18]Here comes the heal.
[39:01.20]Why did it not trigger?
[39:01.86]It didn't trigger.
[39:04.27]Why did this not trigger?
[39:05.17]What?
[39:07.31]Why?
[39:07.51]That didn't trigger at all.
[39:08.73]Exposed.
[39:09.61]Why did it?
[39:10.87]Wasn't I exposed?
[39:12.78]It triggered already?
[39:16.32]You lost to the stag, dude.
[39:18.54]Hey, I beat the first boss.
[39:21.63]It triggered earlier?
[39:23.17]It happened already?
[39:29.77]Ooh.
[39:32.07]You unlock a loot?
[39:33.36]This game's awesome.
[39:34.28]Okay.
[39:35.78]Restore health equal to damage dealt by the strikes on first turn.
[39:40.99]Defeat the first boss with only common items.
[39:42.81]Dude, who else has that?
[39:45.65]As like the seventh friend that played this, I think I'm the only one that got that achievement.
[39:51.02]Oh, that's cool.
[40:02.24]We went against the hog for the first time, now this is in the pool.
[40:07.91]The water item.
[40:15.88]Uh, this is kind of insane, isn't it?
[40:26.11]Ooh, holy shit, there's a lot of challenges.
[40:33.56]Okay, I gotta win against the golem for the first time.
[40:36.76]Put three copies of the same item.
[40:38.43]Or I have to win a battle with one health remaining.
[40:44.00]Got it.
[40:47.02]Uh, let me just check in with the boys here.
[40:51.85]Let's see what the deal is if people are... getting... getting ready.
[40:56.86]Is there a time for another one?
[40:58.98]Looks like people aren't around yet.
[41:00.89]Maybe like another 10 to 15 minutes.
[41:02.23]I can get one done in 10 minutes.
[41:06.01]Let's go.
[41:06.51]This game's fun.
[41:09.07]Alright, new run.
[41:09.95]It is a new boss.
[41:10.73]This is the Brittlebark Beast.
[41:16.36]Whenever Brittlebark takes damage, he takes 3 additional damage.
[41:23.95]Okay, so...
[41:29.89]That's... okay.
[41:34.65]Maybe I should do more morning streams because I can talk like this.
[41:41.84]You hear this?
[41:42.42]You guys hear this?
[41:45.51]This is actually... I can sound super professional now.
[41:50.58]I got the morning voice.
[41:53.44]When are you gonna play Balatro?
[41:56.33]Uh, I've put probably hundreds of hours into that game sitting on the toilet, so... I'm, uh, I've played it, I loved it, it was amazing, I loved every second of it.
[42:09.76]Okay, deal, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[42:11.23]Deal one damage two times.
[42:13.55]That will hurt him even more, right?
[42:15.41]But then I can't fight anything.
[42:19.00]Is this a consumable?
[42:20.66]Will this go away if I... or does this happen every time?
[42:30.88]No, it stays.
[42:32.08]Oh, yep.
[42:34.04]Because that would mean... That'll just hurt him and he'll take six damage.
[42:40.57]Just from that item.
[42:44.41]Oh, baby.
[42:49.00]Uh, yeah.
[42:52.93]Definitely.
[42:54.87]Just for health.
[42:55.73]Always get a weapon, right?
[43:01.44]Maybe should I upgrade this weapon right now?
[43:07.88]Wait, is the strat to leave this and just come back to it when I have something better?
[43:14.37]Or is the strategy just to try to beat the boss at the end?
[43:18.11]Just make sure you're going to beat this boss at the end.
[43:22.33]You can't leave it.
[43:24.23]Ahhh.
[43:31.08]There's multiple anvils, okay.
[43:33.24]I'm gonna do... Let's do the health restore.
[43:41.99]What's this one again?
[43:46.28]Oh, show me where another one is.
[43:48.44]Okay, I'm gonna make my way up to that because I wanna do it again.
[44:00.60]That's good.
[44:09.81]Every other turn, I feel like turns don't last more than four or five turns.
[44:13.67]Maybe I should try to build to this.
[44:24.74]Right?
[44:25.89]So now I get this and I try to find a ton of speed items.
[44:29.65]I'll do that.
[44:32.34]As I'm surrounded.
[44:41.99]Nice.
[44:47.50]Okay, speed.
[44:50.56]God damn it, I knew I should have waited.
[44:52.00]That's a lot of armor.
[45:00.94]But...
[45:01.90]It's not gonna kill anything.
[45:16.44]Should I just do it?
[45:17.70]Get it over with and just upgrade it to the other anvil?
[45:24.13]No, this thing is too much too good.
[45:30.41]Get three thorns at the, that's awesome.
[45:32.86]But this is good too, cause the armor.
[45:38.86]Hmm, I'll take the armor.
[45:56.98]Okay.
[45:58.41]That's one if I combine two items that are the same.
[46:00.35]It makes them better, right?
[46:13.70]Alright, show me where a shop is.
[46:16.66]Alright, good.
[46:17.84]I mean, make some more money and we're going to go up there.
[46:28.90]Hedgehogs die instantly and I don't have to do anything because of the cherry.
[46:39.31]Alright, I'm gonna kill, I'm gonna rest, and then I'm making my way up to the, uh, anvil.
[46:47.34]You piece of shit.
[46:48.24]Do you get the money back when you beat it?
[46:50.15]Why would you?
[46:54.55]Yes!
[47:01.23]I mean, it's definitely this, right?
[47:05.53]Alright, can I make it to the campfire before it happens?
[47:07.28]No!
[47:14.72]That's not good.
[47:24.16]Alright, at least I can buy something.
[47:35.23]10 thorns?!
[47:39.26]Oh my god, how much do I need?
[47:40.84]Okay.
[47:42.34]Maybe I should take this.
[47:51.13]Regain your- I don't have any armor.
[47:52.78]I have three.
[47:57.28]This would be good.
[47:58.42]But, no.
[48:06.67]I think I'm taking this and just say screw it, right?
[48:16.50]Am I realistically gonna get five speed right now?
[48:18.88]No.
[48:19.89]I think I'm gonna replace this.
[48:29.68]I'm doing it.
[48:32.52]Okay, so I'm gonna do... I'll do 11 thorns damage.
[48:38.01]I hope this doesn't end up killing me, but it might.
[48:40.53]Whatever.
[48:42.53]And then I'm going up.
[48:45.40]Because I want to get that anvil.
[48:48.88]And then where's the nearest... Okay, this would be... It's money!
[48:55.03]It costs money now?
[48:56.71]I thought it was free!
[48:57.82]It's ten gold?!
[48:58.72]!
[49:08.20]It replaces it.
[49:12.44]Oh, okay.
[49:18.89]Okay, map mode.
[49:25.32]Oh!
[49:26.71]Waypoints allow you to fast travel over them.
[49:31.96]Oh, that's a massive, massive reason to click those.
[49:36.38]Okay.
[49:36.66]Alright, I need a... Where's the campfire?
[49:41.95]I didn't end up even using this one, so I'll be... Alright, I'm good.
[49:44.00]Let's go.
[49:45.98]I hope I can get there without... He's coming.
[49:50.03]Uh-oh, I'm dead.
[49:53.03]I'm not gonna make it.
[50:02.31]Yes!
[50:05.40]Okay.
[50:06.74]So.
[50:09.50]He's gonna take three additional damage when he takes damage.
[50:13.15]So he'll do... This'll do... This'll do eight damage to him right in the very beginning.
[50:20.02]I'm gonna get hurt for five.
[50:22.54]Which then it'll do... Okay, I think I'm fine.
[50:27.44]Yeah.
[50:28.69]I should fuck him up right now pretty bad.
[50:35.96]Look at that.
[50:38.89]Oh!
[50:39.83]That thorns damage is insane.
[50:43.45]Hit me again.
[50:51.74]How come he's not getting hit for thorns?
[51:00.75]Why is the thorns not doing it?
[51:05.93]I just barely beat him.
[51:09.40]Holy shit.
[51:10.38]Okay, I got it.
[51:11.64]It's a one-time item?
[51:16.41]Oh, only at battle start, not every turn.
[51:19.13]Oh shit.
[51:19.89]Okay, well I got him.
[51:20.73]I beat him!
[51:22.93]Who's next?
[51:24.24]Wait.
[51:26.38]I can't get sucked into this right now.
[51:27.62]I gotta check in on the boys.
[51:28.52]I think they're pretty much ready.
[51:34.81]Ster and Vinny are both getting ready here.
[51:40.73]Vinny said he's going to be going live in a second.
[51:42.43]Okay.
[51:44.13]Can I save it here?
[51:47.40]Or should I just die to see the unlockables?
[51:51.16]I think I'm just going to die.
[51:57.69]You can't save.
[51:58.31]Okay, so I'll just die.
[51:59.87]Let's let this thing kill us.
[52:06.67]This game's awesome, though.
[52:07.59]I like it a lot.
[52:16.13]Let's see what we unlocked.
[52:19.98]Okay, win against Brittle Bark.
[52:24.20]That's a lot of health.
[52:29.07]Who cares?
[52:29.53]One additional damage.
[52:30.75]That's nothing.
[52:32.57]That's an insane amount of HP.
[52:38.93]Ten or more damage with thorns in a single turn.
[52:41.45]Okay, cool.
[52:43.18]Ooh.
[52:45.98]Two attack for each stack of thorn you have.
[52:51.39]Kind of, uh, great.
[52:56.85]Take five or more damage from your own items in one turn.
[53:03.42]A lot of thorns items.
[53:08.29]Gain two thorns for each armor removed by the enemy's first strike.
[53:11.68]Cool.
[53:15.30]I want to go to the menu.
[53:15.90]I want to see the other... Alright.
[53:20.68]Spend a total of 30 gold in a single run.
[53:22.83]Alright.
[53:24.49]Well, this game's awesome.
[53:25.81]He is coming.
[53:26.81]It's on Steam.
[53:28.77]It is available right now.
[53:31.81]And I think it's worth checking out.
[53:34.60]I'm going to go BRB.
[53:36.02]I'm going to get rid of the pre-rolls.
[53:39.70]And we should be playing Mycopunk.
[53:44.87]I'll be back.
[53:46.71]And then when you see me in two or three minutes, I'll be in a call with some buddies.
[53:54.58]I'll be right back.
[54:17.09]Oh, I forgot to mute.
[54:17.88]Sorry, guys.
[54:18.33]I was moving around.
