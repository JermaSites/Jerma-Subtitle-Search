[00:02.35]Yeah, let's play House of Dead.
[00:03.33]That was Dinosaur Fossil Hunter, and it was a really interesting game.
[00:05.59]It was really cool.
[00:06.39]But I want to play, I want to, like, shoot the zombies right now.
[00:12.56]NA Infrastructure, OMEGALUL.
[00:15.81]Nevada, Las Vegas is, like, one of the top five in the country for infrastructure, so excuse me, take that back, please.
[00:22.61]Nevada, like, honestly is, like, number three in infrastructure in the whole country.
[00:26.45]I just, I mean, I have to correct people when they say something incorrect.
[00:29.25]Alright, House of the Dead.
[00:31.11]Do I play this with a mouse?
[00:38.72]Is it just a mouse aiming game?
[00:43.30]So this is a House of the Dead remake.
[00:50.32]Hopefully it's not loud.
[00:51.02]Please don't be loud.
[00:51.66]Please don't be loud.
[00:52.24]I turned it down, but please don't be loud.
[00:53.52]Okay, here it comes.
[01:06.77]I need a game capture, new capture.
[01:10.67]Let's go.
[01:11.41]Where is it?
[01:15.93]Right here.
[01:18.89]There it is.
[01:27.55]Okay.
[01:29.05]Why's my camera all laggy now?
[01:36.18]Uh... The wind!
[01:39.64]This game does not want to be captured.
[01:44.30]What the fuck is happening?
[01:45.60]Watch out for... What is going on?
[01:49.52]Okay, I think we're alright.
[01:53.28]What the fuck just happened?
[02:01.87]Options.
[02:04.72]Is this the- Did I open the right ga- Hello?
[02:07.00]Who's there?
[02:07.44]Oh!
[02:15.16]Um, shadow quality medium?
[02:25.85]That was very jarring.
[02:29.88]Okay, so display.
[02:32.34]Huge scale.
[02:34.08]Hide the HUD.
[02:35.74]Brightness, I don't know, here.
[02:39.97]Quality, what frame rate is this at?
[02:42.45]Gameplay.
[02:44.07]Use vibrations, no.
[02:45.25]No.
[02:48.23]Ammo on crosshair?
[02:50.93]Maybe?
[02:51.45]No, that's ugly.
[02:53.00]Automatic reload.
[02:54.70]Quiet!
[02:56.22]Automatic reload.
[02:57.18]Aim assist medium?
[02:58.34]I don't know what that means.
[03:00.95]What should my player color be?
[03:05.09]Outside thickness.
[03:10.98]Crosshair speed?
[03:12.80]I don't know.
[03:14.28]Sound.
[03:17.23]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[03:18.45]Keyboard, mouse, sensitivity, turn it down.
[03:20.23]Alright, let's go.
[03:26.03]Let's go.
[03:27.84]Welcome in the House of the Dead remake.
[03:30.77]There are many ways to play the game, so make sure you review all options and create a session that suits you best.
[03:36.31]Okay, got it.
[03:37.95]Original.
[03:39.11]Okay, difficulty normal.
[03:40.53]Classic mode.
[03:42.63]Multiplayer mode.
[03:43.45]I don't want to play fucking multiplayer.
[03:45.15]Alright, this one.
[03:47.60]Chapter 1.
[03:48.88]Tragedy.
[03:50.10]Just shoot the fucking zombies.
[03:55.98]I bet you can't name a field of research this is based off of.
[04:02.14]The morgue?
[04:02.60]Alright, let's go!
[04:12.20]Uh, can one of the mods change the game?
[04:19.70]Jesus Christ!
[04:28.57]Nice.
[04:33.33]Alright, let's go.
[04:34.98]House of the Dead.
[04:40.30]Sensitivity's not bad.
[04:49.51]I might need him a little bit higher.
[04:50.57]How do I reload?
[04:53.69]How do you reload?
[04:54.73]R?
[05:01.20]Is the calibration wrong?
[05:06.60]Yeah, guys, I'm holding up the gun like this, and this is where the gun is aiming, and here is where it is on the screen.
[05:15.37]God, these old machines are such pieces of shit.
[05:17.71]Turn aim assist off.
[05:18.77]Okay.
[05:21.51]That always sucked the most.
[05:24.61]Every time that you went with, like, two or three of your friends, and there was, like, a time crisis, or, like, a house of the dead, and you were the sorry motherfucker that got the one that had, like, seven inches of wrong calibration, it was such a pain.
[05:36.84]Because it cost money.
[05:38.06]You had to spend 50 cents per life to do that?
[05:40.78]That's not fair.
[05:42.49]Alright, turn off.
[05:43.35]Turn this off.
[05:43.89]Yeah, I don't need, I don't want that.
[05:49.29]Alright, let's go.
[05:52.25]I think sensitivity needs to be a little bit higher.
[05:54.29]Before my whole- Before my house blows down, okay?
[05:58.16]Like, honest to god, I'm like- I feel like- I feel like they're com- Zombies are coming for me right now.
[06:08.86]I feel like I'm pretty good at this.
[06:20.37]This music!
[06:25.54]Does the game feel like it's in x2 speed for anybody else?
[06:52.25]Got it.
[06:56.83]Extra health, right?
[06:57.75]Nice.
[07:05.33]I wish I had a light gun right now.
[07:07.85]Whoa!
[07:15.16]Close.
[07:28.22]Frog.
[07:36.29]Jesus.
[07:46.60]I feel like I'm hunting extra coffee.
[07:49.96]Shit.
[07:54.00]I feel like I drank too much coffee.
[07:55.14]Did I have way too much coffee?
[07:57.40]Everything feels like it's a hundred miles per hour.
[07:58.75]I drank way too much coffee.
[08:09.61]No, I got to shoot that bug.
[08:12.98]Oh no, I just got the Gigachad.
[08:22.18]I just knew... I freaked out.
[08:24.70]Why did I do that?
[08:26.04]Why did I do that?
[08:26.88]I don't... I sat there for so long.
[08:31.17]I like knew what was happening.
[08:36.11]I was in slow motion.
[08:37.58]The only part that was in slow motion was what just happened.
[08:54.00]Now give me some health.
[09:11.75]Got it.
[09:13.41]AH!
[09:19.69]Fuck you, I'm gonna die.
[09:23.85]There's like skin all over my mouth.
[09:28.73]Skin all over my mouth.
[09:33.05]We're good.
[09:38.15]Who's this?
[09:43.77]Holy shit.
[09:56.84]carry type weak point in the chest.
[10:11.38]I got him!
[10:27.26]I did it!
[10:30.34]That was insane!
[10:40.23]Dead?
[10:44.43]Why would I take a picture?
[10:50.34]Why did I take a pic- Oh, these are all the people that are left alive, okay.
[10:56.52]Alright, not bad.
[10:57.06]Is this hidden treasure somewhere in this area?
[11:06.80]Second chapter.
[11:14.85]Alright, stop panic firing and just shoot.
[11:37.19]Excuse me?
[11:37.99]What was that?
[11:38.61]How did I die?
[11:47.27]Shut the fuck up.
[11:48.30]Continue.
[11:48.70]How many credits do I have?
[11:49.58]10?
[11:49.96]I got 10 coins.
[12:05.18]Party Kroger Oh
[12:36.03]This game's terrifying.
[12:37.33]It's too much.
[12:40.08]The worst part about playing these games alone is there's not three other people in the room that I can pretend I'm playing and they can actually shoot this shit.
[12:47.08]I have to actually kill everything.
[12:55.35]I can't miss.
[12:55.87]I have to kill them.
[13:15.67]Got him.
[13:17.40]Give me that health.
[13:30.30]I shot him in the head like three times.
[13:31.95]That's bullshit.
[13:32.47]Reload.
[13:32.73]Reload.
[13:39.37]Reload.
[13:57.06]Alright.
[13:58.58]Shut up!
[14:07.23]Woah!
[14:07.85]I missed and I haven't pre-fired him!
[14:24.30]Oh my goodness!
[14:39.43]Treasure chest!
[14:40.03]Oh, there's a person behind there.
[14:41.85]Oh, I hate that.
[14:53.45]In mid-air, you go all the way back out.
[14:56.38]That guy didn't even know what happened.
[14:57.92]You're welcome.
[15:40.54]I'm good.
[15:42.96]Nice.
[16:00.34]Oh!
[16:02.88]We're good.
[16:13.30]Don't run in front of me!
[16:24.00]Give me a treasure chest!
[16:32.53]Oh shit.
[16:33.69]How am I supposed to fall asleep to this?
[16:38.21]Hi.
[16:42.37]Weak point.
[16:44.19]Top right.
[16:44.69]Okay, let's go.
[16:47.23]Reload.
[16:48.81]Reload.
[17:05.68]Reload.
[17:07.70]Reload.
[17:09.72]Reload.
[17:28.86]I hate this.
[17:30.52]I hate seeing him throw up.
[17:33.99]Wait, auto reload.
[17:47.16]5 seconds?
[17:48.30]Every second?
[17:59.03]Okay, okay, I'm good What the title is reload
[18:35.18]We won't let you have it your way, Kyrian.
[18:39.24]I think auto-reload is probably worse.
[18:48.63]Afraid of spiders, oh god.
[18:54.31]Truth.
[18:59.66]Yeah, auto-reload sucks.
[19:01.00]Can I turn off the guy saying reload?
[19:06.06]Okay, you can mute reload.
[19:11.33]That's funny.
[19:11.81]Okay, now I don't care.
[19:14.77]Nice.
[19:21.02]Nice.
[19:32.99]Go back?
[19:34.61]No, it's... I don't want to go back.
[19:50.02]Jesus!
[19:50.82]The bullet's bouncing around the room a million times.
[19:55.15]Duck, man.
[19:55.93]Get out of the way.
[19:56.61]Unlock.
[20:09.35]That was pretty good.
[20:10.37]That was a pretty good shot.
[20:13.29]Wait, what?
[20:22.20]What happened?
[20:22.80]I don't get it.
[20:26.58]What happened?
[20:33.66]I threw like a handful of change in the dryer, okay?
[20:36.60]That's like, this is fucking crazy.
[20:38.46]I can't even play the game.
[20:47.30]Alright, see if I can do it.
[20:59.66]Am I winning?
[21:15.24]What happened?
[21:16.04]Oh, I died.
[21:29.82]Bring back reload.
[21:30.83]No!
[21:31.03]I don't like it.
[21:45.46]Isn't there machine guns in the game?
[21:46.62]You can like click on and it's like... That didn't even hit me, that's such bullshit.
[22:14.22]Come on get out of my way here.
[22:16.60]This is a classic game.
[22:17.69]Can you play the classic version without the updated graphics?
[22:27.33]No Hit again
[22:44.87]I'm gonna run out of coins.
[23:01.63]Say reload.

[23:46.27]Just wanna play the game.
[23:47.99]Who cares?
[24:11.71]Watch out!
[24:18.80]What is that weird voice?
[24:21.07]It's hard for me to even hear what I'm even saying.
[24:22.97]I'll be honest.
[24:30.78]The voice changer is not still on.
[24:35.16]You guys are making me waste continues and I don't want to fucking have to use all my fucking fucking say swears.
[24:40.92]I'm not swearing ever again.
[25:00.68]sure am I must compliment you I didn't think you could make it this far however is this the last level this is it let's see how good you really are alright in the head
[25:34.43]That was easy.
[25:36.35]Wait, was I supposed to win that fast?
[25:51.35]Holy shit!
[25:52.09]My ostrich almost flew over.
[25:53.21]That was really loud.
[25:55.25]That was scary.
[26:15.08]Alright.
[26:19.78]I only have seven coins left.
[26:25.08]You're not using a dysfunctional NES light gun.
[26:27.10]This doesn't count.
[26:31.71]I mean, okay.
[26:34.13]I have some thoughts about this game.
[26:37.49]Oh, this is it.
[26:40.63]I think it's hard to make a game like this when you use the mouse.
[26:44.15]When... I mean, the difficulty in this game comes from being able to actually aim a light gun.
[26:49.95]Zit?
[26:52.39]What?
[26:56.25]Why do you think it's Zit?
[26:57.49]Where?
[26:59.79]Where?
[27:00.05]What are you talking about?
[27:01.07]Where?
[27:03.19]Where?
[27:10.01]Where?
[27:11.80]What do you see as it?
[27:12.28]What are you talking about?
[27:16.07]Photo mode.
[27:17.97]Okay.
[27:25.13]God damn it.
[27:43.74]Oh shit!
[27:59.53]Shit!
[27:59.85]My arm hurts!
[28:02.53]My fucking arm hurts!
[28:10.43]My fucking hand hurts!
[28:15.07]Alright, I'm good.
[28:22.17]I don't want to fight the guy that flies, right?
[28:23.69]Do I have to?
[28:24.19]Of course I do.
[28:37.62]Ugh!
[28:45.37]Oh my god, I can shoot with the spacebar.
[28:46.90]Everything has changed.
[28:48.43]Everything's changed.
[28:49.05]I can shoot with spacebar.
[29:17.64]Ow.
[29:20.06]Oh!
[29:50.25]Find reload to your mouse?
[29:52.03]No man, that's not happening.
[29:53.05]Ow.
[29:55.08]I'm going to run out of continues.
[29:58.48]Is that?
[30:15.38]I don't know.
[30:16.66]I think I can take it.
[30:40.34]Nobody gives me instructions.
[30:44.45]I shall destroy everything.
[30:52.99]What happened?
[30:54.53]Why don't you follow my instructions?
[31:01.38]What did he drop?
[31:01.88]What happened?
[31:04.48]What happened?
[31:08.23]Uh oh.
[31:09.87]Unknown.
[31:10.43]Oh shit, it's Mewtwo.
[31:16.84]You gotta shoot him in the muscle tissue.
[31:36.00]This game is giving me a headache.
[31:40.56]I actually have a headache again.
[31:42.46]Because this game is so fucking loud.
[31:45.60]And like the sound effects.
[31:55.08]It sounds like an animal got into a fucking restaurant kitchen.
[32:00.16]And started running around and smashing stuff.
[32:15.96]Somebody get that!
[32:16.64]Somebody get that fox!
[32:22.18]Somebody get him!
[32:23.02]Somebody grab that fox!
[32:31.47]Oh my god.
[32:32.25]I can't lose here.
[32:32.89]I got four continues.
[32:33.71]I can't fuck this up.
[32:48.58]Oh shit, I'm gonna have to- I'm gonna lose.
[32:50.02]Fuck!
[32:59.56]No, don't lose.
[33:00.32]I'm getting weak.
[33:02.75]I'm getting weak.
[33:11.11]Guys, I'm get- I'm- Guys, I'm getting weak.
[33:22.08]Like one of the chefs, one of the chefs like comes out and comes out of the restaurant.
[33:27.24]Comes out of like the door of the kitchen and the fox is like on his face.
[33:31.44]And he's like running around like bumping into tables and shit.
[33:40.34]Is this as loud as it for me as it is for you?
[33:42.35]Okay, no, don't fuck, I have two continues.
[35:03.37]I can't.
[35:45.60]Oh, I'm getting weak.
[35:46.74]Oh, I'm slowing down.
[35:47.78]I actually am slowing down.
[35:52.98]Okay, I win.
[36:05.19]Well, no.
[36:05.75]It's not going to be phase two, right?
[36:17.04]Everything is over.
[36:19.60]I have nothing more to lose.
[36:22.68]However, I must go on.
[36:34.83]Goodbye, Kyrie.
[36:37.41]Farewell, Sophie.
[36:50.69]I did it.
[37:01.53]Accept.
[37:04.55]How do I accept?
[37:06.11]Accept.
[37:07.37]Tab is accept?
[37:10.09]I don't care.
[37:21.12]That was crazy.
[37:22.80]That was just crazy.
[37:24.68]I feel like that was weird.
[37:25.65]A new chapter came out?
[37:26.11]Okay.
[37:26.25]New chapter?
[37:49.33]Okay, wait.
[37:49.75]New campaign.
[37:51.99]Oh, I can do horde mode.
[37:53.41]Let me try this.
[37:59.15]And then... Maybe I shouldn't.
[38:02.43]My head's killing me right now.
[38:07.04]Let's go into the... Let's go into chapter 4.
[38:10.78]Horde mode.
[38:11.12]Horde mode.
[38:19.18]Take a break.
[38:20.04]I'm probably going to end the stream.
[38:25.44]Honestly, I was laughing at like... Alright, what does horde mode mean?
[38:28.82]I just want to know what it means.
[38:33.49]Oh, no way.
[38:34.43]It was kind of... Dude, how the fuck are you supposed to do this?
[38:51.72]I used bit raid?
[38:52.24]What do you mean?
[39:07.37]Alright, yeah, I'm done.
[39:08.39]I'm done.
[39:08.67]This is like making it worse.
[39:10.43]This is making it worse.
[39:15.31]This game is fun.
[39:16.91]It's alright.
[39:18.82]It's cool they remade it.
[39:20.02]I mean, I would like a light gun in my hand, but you know, whatever.
[39:30.89]I just want to see what makes this Horde mode.
[39:37.33]I'm done.
[39:37.65]I'm not playing against this guy.
[39:38.43]I'm not playing against that guy.
[39:42.97]Nope.
[39:46.80]That was kind of fun.
[39:47.30]That was House of the Dead remake.
[39:50.45]Okay.
[39:53.10]So here's the plan.
[39:59.04]I didn't stream yesterday because I had a bad migraine.
[40:00.76]And I was like, I'm going to be careful today because I don't want to make it worse so I don't fuck up the rest of the week's streams.
[40:06.31]So I'm just going to stop.
[40:11.31]I'm drinking water.
[40:11.91]I'm alright.
[40:13.91]That was kind of fucking wild.
[40:16.61]Short one today.
[40:17.19]Okay.
[40:18.97]But I will be back.
[40:20.01]We will do a full one on... Where's today?
[40:27.14]We'll be back on Tuesday.
[40:28.04]Probably Tuesday and Wednesday.
[40:28.88]I have a lot of games to play.
[40:31.20]We got Later Alligator.
[40:33.88]Blood Wash.
[40:34.46]Horror game shit.
[40:36.56]We got Murder House.
[40:38.14]Oh my... This fucking wind is... Oh my god.
[40:46.35]Oh my... Hold on.
[40:49.88]Listen to this shit.
[40:53.42]Okay.
[40:54.84]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[40:59.72]We will do later alligator because that's what pre-stream chat voted on.
[41:05.18]Sorry, I'm only here for like three and a half hours.
[41:08.06]I kind of planned on only streaming for like three or four hours today just because of how I felt yesterday.
[41:11.88]I had a good time.
[41:13.94]That was a lot of fun.
[41:14.66]Dinosaur game was fun.
[41:15.62]That was cool.
[41:16.06]I thought it was like an interesting game.
[41:19.74]The House of Dead remake.
[41:20.64]It was alright.
[41:22.94]I mean, I think it was a little too intense, probably.
[41:25.98]It was, I think, fun.
[41:27.68]If you had a light gun, I think it would be way better.
[41:30.69]This guy hates streaming.
[41:35.69]I don't hate streaming.
[41:37.67]Zip, by the way.
[41:39.67]I developed a zip from that game.
[41:42.35]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[41:43.53]Thanks for watching.
[41:45.47]Quick one.
[41:47.67]I'll be back on Tuesday, Wednesday.
[41:51.19]Maybe like Tuesday, Friday?
[41:52.75]Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday?
[41:53.89]We'll see.
[41:54.47]Whatever.
[41:55.33]My schedule is all over the place, so we'll see.
[42:05.16]Thank you.
[42:06.18]Wait!
[42:06.38]I didn't want to do that immediately.
[42:08.42]I wanted to do this.
[42:11.22]There we go.
[42:11.54]Yeah, we'll raid somebody.
[42:16.26]Let's see.
[42:16.58]Who's live right now?
[42:21.72]Who is currently live?
[42:32.77]Is Con- is Connor live?
[42:35.71]Yeah, we'll raid Connor.
[42:41.99]That sounds like a plan.
[42:46.45]Jesus.
[42:50.57]You can hear that, right?
[42:54.88]mouth sounds.
[42:56.46]Because my noise gate is off.
[42:58.98]So you guys get to hear like... Yeah, this is why I have a noise gate.
[43:06.65]This is why all streamers have a noise gate.
[43:10.67]There, I fixed it.
[43:12.85]Everybody has a noise gate so you don't hear the weird mouth sounds.
[43:18.26]Yeah, like... God damn it, I fucking hate that.
[43:22.76]You just saw me naked.
[43:26.17]Okay, let's raid Connor.
[43:37.02]What's Connor doing?
[43:37.66]What are you up to?
[43:48.42]Just chatting.
[43:51.48]Oh, I think Connor's in the process of raiding, doing a tier list of all the consoles, all the old consoles.
[43:58.56]That should be pretty interesting stuff.
[44:01.46]Pretty cool.
[44:04.33]Look forward to his absolutely incorrect opinions on everything, right?
[44:11.83]Alright, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[44:13.21]Thanks for watching.
[44:13.87]Bye, take care of yourselves.
[44:16.57]Call your mother.
[44:18.73]Mother's Day, especially.
[44:22.59]Take care of yourselves.
[44:26.77]Good night.
[44:29.04]And goodbye.
[45:04.42]So,
