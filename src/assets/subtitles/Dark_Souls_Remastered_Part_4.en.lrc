[00:01.98]Hi guys.
[00:04.92]Welcome to the party.
[00:08.92]I'm holding my breath here because I was running a stream test just to the fake Twitch servers.
[00:17.23]And it looked okay.
[00:19.23]We were green.
[00:20.81]But near the end here, it got a little on the maybe side.
[00:27.19]Let's just hope that maybe doesn't turn into awful.
[00:31.54]It looks like it's holding up at this one specific spot.
[00:37.29]Let's see what happens.
[00:38.25]I told you I was gonna give it a try again today.
[00:39.85]We're gonna try it again today.
[00:47.48]You sound like a weatherman.
[00:51.18]Well, if you take a look here, we got a cold front coming in.
[00:54.28]Gonna be a little bit chilly out there, so make sure you grab yourself an umbrella.
[00:58.74]Because rain, freezing rain, this is the kind of rain that'll damage your car.
[01:03.17]So, bundle up out there, guys.
[01:09.89]Especially in this Milwaukee area here.
[01:13.19]Get a coat.
[01:14.13]Don't wait.
[01:15.17]Don't wait till the future.
[01:17.72]Be a present man.
[01:28.25]It's summer?
[01:29.27]Not on the other side of the world.
[01:31.55]It might be summer for you.
[01:33.45]Who said that was Milwaukee, United States?
[01:36.92]I was talking about Milwaukee, Japan.
[01:41.52]Come on, guys.
[01:42.06]Alright, give me a second.
[01:45.56]I'm going to just make sure this is all working.
[01:47.47]More Dark Souls.
[01:48.07]We're going to try to continue Sentence Fortress.
[01:51.03]Hope it works.
[01:51.99]See you in a minute.
[02:11.52]Milwaukee, Russia.
[02:12.79]Not Milwaukee, Japan.
[02:13.97]Milwaukee, France.
[02:19.11]It's winter somewhere in the world.
[02:20.63]I just don't know where currently.
[02:32.30]Where is it winter right now?
[02:33.52]It's winter somewhere.
[02:37.38]Is it winter in Australia?
[02:40.31]It's winter in Australia.
[02:41.41]Milwaukee, Australia.
[02:42.61]See?
[02:43.61]Get a coat, for Christ's sake.
[02:45.37]You're gonna catch a cold.
[02:46.25]Alright, here we go.
[03:10.34]Move back to here.
[03:13.24]There is Dark Souls.
[03:15.83]There it is.
[03:16.53]Cool.
[03:17.17]Very cool.
[03:20.07]Move this bad guy out of the way.
[03:23.55]Which puts us here.
[03:24.57]How's the sound?
[03:25.39]Sounds alright.
[03:26.25]Looks alright.
[03:27.99]Sven's Fortress.
[03:30.02]Got the bonfire.
[03:30.80]I was going to kindle this bonfire.
[03:33.96]I didn't do it yet, so let's kindle it.
[03:39.54]Let's get those 10 Estus flasks.
[03:43.12]Heck yeah, that's not Asus.
[03:44.48]It's a Zeus.
[03:45.24]It's not Estus.
[03:46.12]It's Estus.
[03:50.12]I don't think I can level up anything, can I?
[03:57.14]I cannot.
[03:57.58]Do I have any crunchies?
[03:59.94]I don't know if I have any cheese crunchies.
[04:03.11]I don't.
[04:06.37]You know, I'm just so sick of people mispronouncing that.
[04:11.59]So, I panicked.
[04:13.01]I haven't even walked in this door yet.
[04:14.71]Can I go anywhere from here?
[04:17.31]No.
[04:19.25]There's nowhere to go from here.
[04:24.56]So, we're going to continue through Sen's Fortress.
[04:28.24]I got the shortcut, kind of.
[04:30.20]There's a staircase there.
[04:34.01]Illusory wall.
[04:35.19]Nope.
[04:35.73]Not that way.
[04:39.73]I guess I have to go here.
[04:42.75]Now, where does this go?
[04:45.54]So, you go through the window.
[04:48.46]So, that's the shortcut, because that's the... Okay.
[04:52.84]Which leads us up here, because this is where the... This is where the guys are throwing rocks at us.
[04:59.03]Okay.
[04:59.67]Okay, I feel ya.
[05:00.35]Okay.
[05:02.81]Didn't go... I'm gonna go right.
[05:05.65]No, no, no, no.
[05:06.25]I'm gonna go this way.
[05:08.75]We didn't even walk down here.
[05:09.79]I'm sure there's probably something...
[05:13.59]Like a, you know, like a guy throwing rocks.
[05:15.63]That's definitely what's over here.
[05:20.61]How far does he throw the rocks, and where is he currently standing?
[05:23.52]And why would this be here?
[05:24.54]There's definitely an illusionary wall here.
[05:28.00]Right?
[05:28.36]Why would this be over here?
[05:31.38]There's nothing here.
[05:32.58]Besides this illusionary wall.
[05:37.32]Jeremiah, make funny sounds, please.
[05:38.94]See, I told you there was an illusionary wall here.
[05:41.28]That's this guy's first and last name.
[05:51.68]Titanite shard, okay.
[05:54.37]Where did he come from?
[05:55.59]Did he follow me all the way down here?
[06:02.50]Okay, there's more to go down.
[06:04.24]Didn't even see it because I'm a little slow to react, but wait.
[06:08.94]Item.
[06:12.95]Can I get it from dropping down here?
[06:18.91]I don't think I can get that.
[06:20.13]Maybe can I jump from there?
[06:21.51]Can I jump over this and over to there?
[06:27.87]It's worth a shot, guys.
[06:34.02]Oh.
[06:39.96]Okay.
[06:44.42]Okay.
[06:47.39]Now, now I understand.
[06:49.37]Okay.
[06:52.51]Well, whatever.
[06:53.09]Let's try it again.
[06:54.75]I think I just had to stay still.
[07:00.09]I'm not so sure about that.
[07:03.33]Let's see what happens if I go like this!
[07:10.54]Hooray!
[07:12.16]I got the item!
[07:14.40]Sniper crossbow, sniper bolt.
[07:19.31]Looks like that's all I can do.
[07:23.37]Nothing else, right?
[07:27.17]It's the worst ranged weapon in the game.
[07:30.02]Well, I'm really glad that I picked it up.
[07:31.44]Alright, now we're down here.
[07:32.38]Back where this guy is.
[07:33.28]See if we can falling R1 on this guy.
[07:41.30]Got ya.
[07:43.39]Okay.
[07:43.99]That is, I think, everything that's down here.
[07:45.83]No, there's one of these guys.
[07:51.39]Damn it, I can never get that.
[07:58.09]Switching over to the... Wait, hold on.
[08:03.02]Is this thing alive?
[08:10.92]He would have got up, right?
[08:17.36]Okay, good.
[08:21.01]Flame Stoneplate Ring.
[08:23.53]What is that?
[08:28.37]Boost Fire Defense.
[08:29.57]Maybe I should put it on.
[08:31.71]Considering people are throwing bombs at me.
[08:47.55]Eat the fucking raspberry.
[08:48.79]Somebody just died over there.
[08:49.79]How?
[08:49.91]Alright, I think that's all I can do down there.
[08:51.83]I feel like this is a pre-recorded stream.
[08:57.23]Why?
[08:57.41]Because I'm like checking out down here.
[08:59.85]Okay, what's over there?
[09:01.79]Nice, a ring.
[09:02.52]Got the ring.
[09:03.04]Okay.
[09:03.86]Cool ring.
[09:04.34]That looks good on me.
[09:06.08]I guess I'm doing like active reactionary commentary about everything.
[09:11.42]God damn it!
[09:12.14]Pay attention!
[09:12.78]The guy that throws the stuff is up there!
[09:16.46]Whatever.
[09:33.19]Wait, he throws it over here too?
[09:34.15]He throws it over here!
[09:34.79]I haven't been up here yet.
[09:42.33]I, I, I, I, I, I... That's where the bonfire is.
[09:47.68]What in the name of God?
[09:49.18]Where are you even throwing that from?
[09:51.58]What?
[09:52.48]I'm... I've been that close to a fire before in real life and it didn't burn me.
[09:57.04]Come on now, please.
[09:59.96]Where is he throwing this from?
[10:03.16]I'm just, is it this guy throwing it?
[10:07.58]There's probably like four of them throwing these things.
[10:11.32]I'm gonna go over here.
[10:12.34]There's a guy over there, though.
[10:18.86]Okay.
[10:20.10]Can I kill these guys?
[10:25.73]Let me just take a look.
[10:31.47]I'm scared that guy's gonna just bowling ball that over here right now.
[10:33.69]No, he's not.
[10:34.03]Alright, so... We got a spot over there.
[10:36.47]We can go down.
[10:37.65]Let's just see what happens.
[10:38.73]Okay, guy with a... Guy shooting a bow and arrow.
[10:42.60]Oh my god.
[10:44.58]Oh my god.
[10:46.42]Oh god, it's this guy.
[10:48.78]It's you.
[10:49.94]You're doing that.
[10:53.76]Okay.
[11:04.73]I think it's a jump to There's a guy over there What's that something over there let's deal with this guy first I
[11:29.33]How's the stream looking?
[11:30.15]Are we lagging?
[11:31.11]Are we good?
[11:31.63]Any dropped frames?
[11:32.31]Doesn't look like it so far.
[11:34.11]That makes me happy.
[11:38.05]What's this?
[11:38.73]Looks like an elevator maybe?
[11:39.67]I can't tell.
[11:46.19]This looks like one of those Bloodborne elevators.
[11:49.89]Can I open this up and get in or anything?
[11:54.84]I can.
[11:55.32]Okay.
[11:55.98]It is.
[11:57.46]Where's this going to take me?
[12:00.08]It's locked.
[12:00.76]Shit, really?
[12:10.89]Somebody up here.
[12:12.93]I'm getting closer to the top of this fortress.
[12:18.02]I really wanted to explore more of that.
[12:19.78]What was going on over there.
[12:20.70]I feel like this is more progression.
[12:27.74]I'm just waiting for a guy to throw something.
[12:30.41]You know what I mean?
[12:31.77]One of those boulders is going to land over here.
[12:35.17]It's going to happen.
[12:35.71]When is it going to happen?
[12:36.39]Where is he?
[12:40.91]I knew it.
[12:41.27]I knew it.
[12:41.55]I knew it.
[12:41.77]Tight Night Shard.
[12:52.12]Where is it going?
[12:53.14]Yeah, I knew it was going to happen, man.
[12:56.08]This place is rough.
[12:58.98]Oh, it's Havel!
[13:01.42]Should I go kill Havel too?
[13:10.24]Not yet.
[13:10.72]Not now.
[13:12.34]I need like a safe zone.
[13:15.04]Well, forget about safe zone because there is the boss right here.
[13:19.76]Is there a little shortcut I can take or anything?
[13:25.47]I can go up this way.
[13:28.67]Wait, is this one of those scenarios where I can talk to the guy?
[13:32.01]Like, remember the giant in Bloodborne?
[13:33.53]And he's like, oh, make peace.
[13:35.89]Right?
[13:36.81]They stole that from this game.
[13:39.31]No, he's not.
[13:40.17]He's a hostile.
[13:40.85]He's a hostile.
[13:43.27]Not Bloodborne.
[13:43.81]It was in Dark Souls 3.
[14:00.75]I don't want him throwing shit anymore.
[14:01.79]I'm killing him.
[14:06.18]I didn't even hit him.
[14:29.62]Got him.
[14:30.32]No more rocks.
[14:37.23]Finally.
[14:37.63]I don't have to worry about the rocks anymore.
[14:43.85]Oh, I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore.
[14:46.07]I can take my time through this place.
[14:47.47]Oh, so there's the boss.
[14:54.19]We can fight him on that little platform.
[14:55.97]Should be fun.
[14:56.83]Can't wait.
[14:59.50]Nothing else up here behind the blocks here.
[15:07.33]Those are not rocks, but I just call them blocks.
[15:12.47]Alright.
[15:13.92]We got safety.
[15:22.19]I'm not done.
[15:23.27]I'm not going to go in the boss door yet.
[15:24.66]I want to look out and explore a little.
[15:26.22]Now that I don't have to worry about bombs raining down on me.
[15:31.22]I could go down there and fight the Havel too.
[15:35.54]That fall won't kill me.
[15:36.72]I'm going to keep that in mind.
[15:37.88]Let me just see what's over here.
[15:43.99]NPC or something?
[15:45.67]What is this?
[15:46.85]This is very clearly something here.
[15:49.57]There's going to be an illusionary wall here.
[15:54.49]What's the purpose of this building?
[15:58.45]Come on, this floor breaks or something, right?
[16:10.14]This is strange.
[16:11.14]Something up?
[16:16.30]Oh, there's a summon here if I'm a human.
[16:19.45]Oh, well.
[16:19.97]Okay.
[16:20.79]I'm not done yet.
[16:21.47]I'm not going over there.
[16:22.15]I want to see if I can do this.
[16:25.41]Hopefully this doesn't kill me.
[16:28.53]Look, we're exploring around.
[16:29.46]I don't have to worry about Mr. Rockman anymore, so... Oh, no.
[16:33.40]Holy... No!
[16:34.46]God damn it!
[16:39.37]I didn't jump.
[16:56.66]Whatever.
[16:56.98]I don't have to... The whole point of doing all that was to not... The rock guy's not there.
[17:00.66]That's all I care about.
[17:01.86]Now I'm just going to keep exploring.
[17:04.26]There's only one rock guy.
[17:10.52]Where are my souls?
[17:11.04]Are they going to be all the way up there or are they going to be down where I died?
[17:13.18]There's another place I could go.
[17:31.67]down here.
[17:32.75]What a secret.
[17:33.81]What a secret place, huh?
[17:35.63]I could have just walked over here.
[17:38.60]God damn it, man.
[17:42.26]Well, I can't dodge around him because he's too big.
[17:44.56]I'm going to have to pull him back.
[17:45.38]Yeah, go on.
[17:52.16]Come on up here.
[17:54.54]Up the stairs.
[17:55.02]I ain't going to fuck around with you on the stairs.
[17:56.22]I can't backstab you on the stairs.
[17:57.68]You ass.
[18:01.80]Apparently I can't backstab you there either.
[18:09.20]Can't backstab you there.
[18:10.08]Come on, what's... Don't you dare.
[18:11.14]Alright.
[18:14.93]He didn't even drop anything.
[18:17.81]13k cells down the drain?
[18:18.99]No.
[18:19.33]They're gonna be up where I fell, right?
[18:21.05]Isn't it point of death?
[18:22.97]It's like point of entry, right?
[18:24.19]Where you fall.
[18:26.95]See, look, there's another thing over here.
[18:28.25]Okay, so I'm not done yet.
[18:29.71]I'm not doing the boss yet.
[18:31.25]I want to see what else is here.
[18:33.31]We'll get our souls.
[18:34.05]I'm not going to die.
[18:34.65]There's nothing else dangerous over here.
[18:36.07]Probably not.
[18:40.13]There's another thing over here.
[18:50.02]Fine, go ahead and shoot.
[18:53.50]Shoot it.
[18:55.90]Look, I know.
[18:56.66]I understand.
[18:57.46]I understand that you gave this game like an 8.5 when it came out.
[19:01.25]But Mr. IGN reviewer, you know, you could use a different weapon.
[19:05.79]This guy's kind of scaring me.
[19:14.38]Oh my god!
[19:14.78]He's going to kill me!
[19:15.36]Alright, I can't.
[19:18.18]This is too fast to parry.
[19:24.83]Why is the IGN guy so good?
[19:32.44]Ooh, Rickard.
[19:35.82]That was Rickard.
[19:38.60]He's poking through my armor.
[19:39.92]Yeah, he had to just die.
[19:40.94]I was going to try and parry him.
[19:42.85]Oh, okay.
[19:43.17]I got Rickard's armor.
[19:56.61]Ooh, divine blessing.
[19:57.43]Nice.
[20:01.73]I don't think it... Rare ring of sacrifice.
[20:13.96]What does that mean?
[20:15.36]Does that give you more souls?
[20:16.86]Die, lose nothing, nullify curse, ring breaks.
[20:20.14]Ooh.
[20:20.30]Ooh.
[20:25.96]Okay, so this is, you can get rid of a curse.
[20:29.02]That's good to have.
[20:31.20]Alright, we've got the items.
[20:32.14]I got Rickard's Rappaport.
[20:36.76]I got, you know, I picked up the Michael Rappaport weapon, so I'm fine.
[20:47.97]Anything else to do in Sen's Fortress?
[20:54.91]Does a door mimic
[20:59.18]Die, wear a ring to die instantly.
[21:02.18]That would be fucked up.
[21:07.40]Yeah, you know, if Dark Souls wants to come up with a Dark Souls 4, they need to start adding, like, Stair Mimics.
[21:13.56]That would really throw people off.
[21:16.22]Like, oh, wow, this looks like a really easy way for me to go up there.
[21:18.40]I thought I had to go all the way around to Sven's Fortress.
[21:21.84]Nope, you step on it and it, like, opens its mouth and bites you.
[21:25.08]You really want to start?
[21:26.16]Add Kaizo Blocks to Dark Souls.
[21:29.47]You go for a jump and you hit your head on it.
[21:31.65]It shows up on the screen.
[21:35.11]I didn't do anything here.
[21:37.85]I feel like I can drop on that and walk across it or something.
[21:41.13]I could go that way.
[21:43.73]Let's not make any mistakes.
[21:47.95]Also this way.
[21:49.23]Alright, here we go.
[21:50.49]Come on.
[21:56.07]I can do it.
[21:59.13]Need to go a little bit further.
[22:11.33]Baldur's Sidesword?
[22:12.42]That's new.
[22:15.26]Get the souls.
[22:18.30]It's alright.
[22:19.10]Those souls will be fine.
[22:22.04]Go get the souls.
[22:22.92]Well, where are they?
[22:24.12]Shouldn't they have been up where I was?
[22:27.84]Come on.
[22:28.16]Let me go get... I'll go get the souls.
[22:33.44]Is that actually, like, the best sword in the game?
[22:35.25]Did I just get a rare drop?
[22:40.77]Let me see if I can see my souls in the ground and see where they are.
[22:54.79]That's so funny.
[22:56.15]Nice.
[22:56.41]I got a cool sword.
[22:57.25]I still have to go that way.
[22:59.48]Where do I fall off?
[23:04.26]It's rare, but it's not that great.
[23:05.44]I'll still look at it in a minute when we get a check-in.
[23:07.72]When we get a check-in?
[23:09.73]When we get one check-in, guys, I'll take a look.
[23:13.89]Okay, I didn't fall over there.
[23:28.01]What about around the side?
[23:29.37]Isn't this where I did it?
[23:30.19]Where did I do it?
[23:33.13]No, it's up a little further.
[23:34.26]I gotta, like, look down.
[23:42.38]The boss is visible, you're right.
[23:44.28]So where did I fucking jump off from?
[23:45.62]Isn't it, like, here or there?
[23:48.22]I don't even remember.
[23:48.84]It was, like, up.
[23:49.34]There it is.
[23:49.74]Alright, there are my souls.
[23:50.68]There they are.
[23:52.28]So I gotta go down.
[23:56.15]Out through there.
[24:06.24]Okay, got him.
[24:07.54]I got him.
[24:08.74]Souls retrieved.
[24:13.00]I'm thinking I should probably go back to the bonfire too.
[24:15.86]Because this is too many souls to lose.
[24:18.50]I'm about to fight a boss.
[24:25.55]I'm going to go back and walk the other way.
[24:29.43]There's a guy down there.
[24:30.27]There's another way I didn't go.
[24:31.11]No boss yet.
[24:33.50]Hold on.
[24:37.45]Where was that spot?
[24:39.61]In here, right?
[24:42.17]There's another way to go.
[24:43.33]And there was a guy at the end of the tunnel.
[24:47.61]Yeah, down here.
[24:48.15]I didn't go down here yet.
[24:52.97]Okay.
[24:53.27]Well, there's the gap.
[24:55.15]But you are guarding some kind of secret.
[25:05.94]Or maybe you're not.
[25:08.51]What was down here?
[25:12.98]That's it?
[25:14.40]That's it?
[25:16.40]Just a view?
[25:21.34]Oh, well.
[25:21.72]Alright, let's go level up.
[25:23.05]I don't want to lose these souls, because I'll probably die to the boss at least once or twice.
[25:29.29]And you understand, like, I'm going for it.
[25:36.42]Oh my god, I almost just fell off.
[25:44.66]Just give me my weapon back I'm fucking standing here give me my weapon give him my weapon back.
[25:58.74]Oh There's a guy in here Who's this
[26:08.38]Undead.
[26:09.58]Not so much of an optimist.
[26:12.66]Oh, you're a hunter.
[26:37.04]Ooh, this guy sells green blossoms.
[26:39.12]I know what those do.
[26:40.16]Ooh, large Titanite shards.
[26:41.56]Green Titanite shards.
[26:44.02]Great sword, great axe, balder shield.
[26:48.14]He sells the Katarina armor.
[26:49.68]Should I be the onion?
[26:51.92]I think this weighs too much for me.
[26:58.62]Thunderstone plate.
[27:00.20]Spellstone plate.
[27:01.08]Should I be fat onion guy?
[27:06.28]Is this going to weigh too much, though?
[27:13.20]Why does he have the onion guy stuff?
[27:22.09]Steel helm.
[27:22.65]Let me just see what else he has.
[27:24.39]Balder helm.
[27:28.81]How much is this to buy it all?
[27:31.91]My god, that's 10,000.
[27:32.73]This is too much.
[27:36.21]It's too much.
[27:37.58]Can I just get the marshmallow outfit?
[27:41.90]How much poise does this have?
[27:44.08]A lot.
[27:44.58]Okay, but is it more than what I have now?
[27:51.04]Hold on.
[27:55.76]I need to look at this.
[27:58.52]Elite Knight has how much poise?
[28:00.43]More.
[28:00.85]This is just so much better.
[28:13.33]Toggle display.
[28:14.15]Can I do a comparison here?
[28:18.87]21.
[28:18.89]Oh, it's a little bit there.
[28:22.59]Just get these two.
[28:25.11]And just wear like little baby pants.
[28:33.16]Okay, hold on.
[28:34.24]I'm going to look so stupid.
[28:41.76]Okay, where is it?
[28:48.39]Okay, are you sure you guys I'm not just a bee?
[28:54.05]I'm a fucking bee.
[28:58.67]This looks so bad.
[28:59.87]Alright, well, I guess I'm running around as the bumblebee.
[29:06.55]What's my equipment load?
[29:08.70]Pretty high already.
[29:13.36]I need 10,000 more souls.
[29:15.86]No, I don't want the helmet.
[29:16.72]I want to be the bumblebee.
[29:20.10]I need to look more like a bee.
[29:25.40]Is it like a bright yellow helmet?
[29:28.96]What is the most bug bee like here?
[29:31.00]Probably this.
[29:31.56]I don't want to wear shoes either.
[29:39.19]I feel like that looks fun.
[29:45.89]What about gloves?
[29:47.29]Are they like black gloves I can wear?
[29:50.60]Here we go.
[29:51.08]Black gloves and... No pants.
[29:57.76]For now.
[30:00.10]We have to be the B for a few minutes.
[30:06.29]I'm still... I'm mid-rolling.
[30:07.31]I'm fine.
[30:15.27]Yeah, I'm fine.
[30:18.42]Because if I put any... This is going to get too high for me.
[30:23.83]I wish there was still like a bare feet I could put on.
[30:29.95]Let me look at the sack head again.
[30:32.61]Standard helm.
[30:34.79]Wait, hold on.
[30:36.76]No, I don't like that.
[30:39.86]This one?
[30:43.22]No, I look like a gnome.
[30:47.36]It's gonna have to be the sack.
[30:53.90]Yeah, the fucking barefoot bumblebee bandit.
[30:56.43]I like it.
[30:58.15]We can always go back.
[30:59.93]Actually, you know, I want to buy some of those stamina boosters as well.
[31:07.63]Purchase, I want... Anything else?
[31:11.11]Yeah, I definitely want those green blossoms.
[31:12.83]I want a ton of them.
[31:19.45]Those things are so useful.
[31:23.21]Alright, well, we used our stuff, so I'm gonna... Is there maybe a... There might be a door to open here.
[31:34.40]And then this shortcut is like a guaranteed you're gonna die half the time you do it, but it's probably a shortcut to the boss.
[31:38.48]Let's find out.
[31:42.89]Maybe.
[31:47.51]Oh, hey there.
[31:50.62]You wanna fuck with a bumblebee?
[31:51.64]You're gonna get the stinger!
[32:00.23]Cage key.
[32:01.33]Hey, that's what I'm looking for.
[32:02.51]Just roll down the stairs.
[32:12.41]I guess one thing that sucks about this is I should be using a rapier, right?
[32:16.13]Or a real stinger.
[32:21.72]Well, we're really not playing the part.
[32:22.90]This is annoying me, actually.
[32:24.53]I'm switching my entire character to use, like, a little rapier.
[32:26.69]Alright, I can open the door now.
[32:32.81]I don't know if I can make this.
[32:43.01]I almost didn't make it.
[32:44.05]Okay, now let's go to where the cages are.
[32:48.43]Yeah, the rapier is dex.
[32:49.35]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[32:50.55]Oh, well.
[32:55.42]I love how this looks.
[32:57.60]It's so stupid.
[32:59.28]Alright.
[33:00.38]Use the cage key.
[33:01.46]Now get in the cage.
[33:04.08]Take me down.
[33:05.14]Can I even fit in here?
[33:14.96]Oh my god.
[33:15.62]Wait.
[33:16.16]I don't... I don't want to go out here.
[33:18.20]Hold on.
[33:22.23]This is like right in the... This is right in the front door.
[33:28.51]Oh my, I'm dead!
[33:31.10]I was, I'm... That's not a good place to go.
[33:38.53]Oh no, fucking bonfire!
[33:43.97]Oh shit!
[34:00.53]Damn it.
[34:00.95]I'm just gonna go down and do it there I'm gonna go touch the bonfire down here.
[34:04.92]Oh That's so far down god damn it man seriously Is the cage can I call the cage back up Can I like pull the cage back up or is it still just down there I Mean I've dropped the cage already down and can I like call it back?
[34:27.90]I guess I can just call it back up, huh?
[34:29.20]Oh
[34:31.59]Okay.
[34:32.03]Now I'm not as annoyed.
[34:42.94]Go to the boss?
[34:43.54]Well, I want to get a better run back to the boss.
[34:48.64]That's a much better run back.
[34:50.32]It's just going to the first bonfire and running to the front door.
[35:02.09]Just do it again.
[35:03.41]That freaked me out.
[35:10.69]Wait, this is better?
[35:13.17]Why is this even here?
[35:18.66]You know what?
[35:19.64]I guess this is worse.
[35:23.16]I'm thinking about this right now.
[35:25.06]And yeah, this is kind of worse.
[35:26.98]This is a worse way to go.
[35:29.30]Isn't it?
[35:36.53]I don't know, it's faster.
[35:43.39]It's definitely faster.
[35:53.82]Why would they even put that there?
[35:56.20]Why is it even there?
[35:57.26]What's the point of that shortcut?
[36:06.28]Alright, I figured that if I get a shortcut, why would I do that?
[36:16.17]For later?
[36:18.11]What else?
[36:18.43]There's more to do in Sen's fortress.
[36:24.11]Okay, well, I guess I'm wrong in thinking that I should use the other bonfire.
[36:29.94]So I'm just gonna go fight the boss.
[36:36.55]You don't have to run through the whole thing when you return.
[36:39.37]I guess so.
[36:40.41]Alright.
[36:43.48]I'll go in the fog gate now.
[36:55.60]This boss is not that hard anyways.
[36:57.01]Well, don't say that to me.
[37:01.35]I've been very well known to one shot, one hit kill, one shot, one time, the hardest bosses in this whole series, and get stuck on the easiest boss in the game for like an hour and a half.
[37:12.86]It's happened before.
[37:15.39]It'll happen many times, actually.
[37:29.48]Don't put it past me to, like, do terrible at, like, an easy boss.
[37:32.16]Because I will.
[37:32.68]Imagine if I got in the cage again.
[37:38.11]Alright, here we go.
[37:39.33]Let's go.
[37:40.97]Bumblebee versus Giant Knight.
[37:42.91]Who would win?
[37:44.69]Iron Golem.
[37:48.41]This is a tiny area.
[37:49.47]You throw shit?
[37:50.01]Okay, you have, like, a wave attack.
[37:53.87]What else do you do?
[38:04.84]For the legs, I guess?
[38:07.24]Jump around.
[38:08.42]I'm gonna get stuck on one of these rocks, I know it.
[38:14.67]How many times does he swing?
[38:19.01]I will roll off this cliff, I guarantee it.
[38:24.87]I will roll off this cliff.
[38:54.30]Oh, he does it a few times, doesn't he?
[39:00.20]But just for the sake of it, I'm gonna top off, because I feel like...
[39:03.72]This really is not that bad.
[39:05.84]And I should be at like 100% health.
[39:09.32]Just in case something crazy happens.
[39:30.55]What's he got?
[39:31.29]Can I like knock him down?
[39:32.25]Well, he's like staggered right now.
[39:36.87]I could have like ended the fight here.
[39:47.02]That's the easiest boss in any Dark Souls game.
[39:48.90]Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, Dark, any of them.
[39:53.28]That guy was easier than the Taurus Demon.
[39:58.50]Okay.
[40:00.16]I was scared there.
[40:01.44]40,000 souls, too.
[40:08.15]I honestly believe that that guy was easier than the Taurus Demon.
[40:12.25]Okay.
[40:12.77]Well.
[40:20.75]Full onion now.
[40:22.07]No, no, no.
[40:23.11]I can't get full onion.
[40:23.93]I have to be the bumblebee with my tiny little blue legs.
[40:26.35]You know bumblebees are blue?
[40:28.70]No, I'm not buying the rest of the onion.
[40:34.06]I don't want it.
[40:35.20]This is what I want to look like.
[40:36.84]I want to look like this.
[40:37.82]This is how I want to look.
[40:41.83]I want to be the layered onion bumblebee.
[40:43.65]Is there anything else I can grab here before I get sucked into the next area?
[40:56.48]Like an illusion wall or something weird.
[40:58.06]These guys put weird stuff in this game all the time.
[41:07.61]I guess we're just gonna examine the light.
[41:11.19]Okay, then I gotta ring the third bell.
[41:27.28]These are the brain monkeys.
[41:28.41]Where are you taking me?
[41:40.67]I love how it takes two of them to carry me.
[41:42.37]That just looks funny.
[41:44.81]That's nice looking.
[41:49.86]Oh my god!
[41:50.62]You guys are taking me to Elsa's castle?! !
[41:55.85]This is awesome!
[41:56.81]What a view!
[41:57.47]I love Disney!
[42:04.83]You know it's Elsa's castle now?
[42:06.04]How fucked up is that?
[42:07.94]How much does that suck?
[42:10.64]Anybody else think that's bullshit?
[42:13.10]That was Cinderella's castle for like 75 years and then all of a sudden they had a really popular movie so they changed it to Elsa's castle.
[42:21.45]Elsa's castle didn't look anything like that.
[42:25.88]Yikes.
[42:28.28]What do you mean, yikes?
[42:33.25]This is for taking me without my permission!
[42:36.31]Disney.
[42:36.81]What's with all the H-A-H and then uppercase A-A?
[42:53.01]Is there a bonfire somewhere I can do this with?
[42:55.21]I don't know if I want to fight a new enemy right now without a bonfire.
[42:59.14]In fact, I really don't.
[43:07.86]I don't think this guy's going to be hostile.
[43:09.16]Is there a bonfire?
[43:14.00]He's not hostile.
[43:15.40]Yes, he is.
[43:21.40]I got a bone.
[43:22.10]I'm boning out of here.
[43:25.31]I have too many souls.
[43:32.60]Well, that didn't hit him.
[43:34.54]I gotta get around him.
[43:53.97]I'm gonna run by him.
[43:55.49]See if there's something... Come on, keep going back.
[43:57.63]Go back!
[43:59.59]Get out of here!
[44:01.07]Go back to your spawn point.
[44:06.14]Go!
[44:06.62]Get out.
[44:07.20]Leave.
[44:10.92]Yes, I understand.
[44:11.58]That's a really funny joke.
[44:12.82]It looks like you're going downstairs.
[44:14.62]There is a platform in front of you that's waist or chest high and it looks like you're going down the stairs.
[44:18.80]That's funny.
[44:20.96]Take it somewhere else, you fucking idiot.
[44:23.38]You shitty little party joke.
[44:24.80]Fuck you.
[44:28.62]Oh my god, you really... Fucking god.
[44:37.59]Okay, I'm gonna kill him.
[44:39.05]I'm gonna kill this guy.

[45:39.98]Jesus Christ.
[45:41.02]Oh, man.

[45:44.96]Oh, wait.

[45:45.70]Oh, man.
[45:46.18]Think fast.
[45:47.86]Where am I going?
[45:50.32]I don't like this big open area.
[45:59.42]I can't move.
[46:04.25]He needs two hits.
[46:06.79]Oh my god, the dodge didn't work.
[46:08.55]The dodge didn't work!
[46:12.11]Shit didn't fucking work.
[46:14.14]I hate when that happens.
[46:14.86]Oh my fucking god.
[46:21.66]I'm gonna die here.
[46:33.92]Swear to God I hate these slow enemies.

[47:35.52]I have too many souls.
[47:36.30]I have to get rid of these.
[47:41.23]Two guys in there.
[47:42.07]Oh, yes.
[47:46.23]Oh, yes.
[47:46.77]Yes.
[47:47.95]The answer is yes.
[47:54.58]Yeah, we've got to cash in, guys.
[48:04.30]I need more vitality.
[48:05.48]34 strength is fine for now.
[48:09.66]Vitality, let's just get this to 25.
[48:11.81]I feel like that's lacking right now.
[48:19.60]Who are you?
[48:21.03]Well, you are a rare visitor.
[48:23.79]Welcome to the lost city of Anor Londo, chosen undead.
[48:27.89]If you seek Lord Gwyn's old keep, exit here.
[48:30.73]I'm going to be done with vitality for now.
[48:32.47]I just want to give it 25.
[48:33.57]If you are the chosen one, a revelation shall visit thee.
[48:37.59]What follows thereafter depends upon you.
[48:42.80]Oh, you can reinforce the flasks now.
[48:44.30]That's cool.
[48:45.12]What am I?
[48:46.08]She's a firekeeper.
[48:47.54]Well...
[48:49.09]I am the keeper of the bonfire.
[48:50.69]This goldfish head lady?
[48:52.93]What beacon would there be in this lost city?
[48:55.43]A gatekeeper.
[48:57.15]And a guide.
[48:58.97]That is my calling.
[49:02.57]Well, it's good to know that I can do that.
[49:03.95]And this is already reinforced, so that's great.
[49:08.05]It's just great.
[49:10.69]Now I don't feel terrible.
[49:11.81]I'm not scared.
[49:12.73]Let's go explore this place a little bit.
[49:18.24]You know, you are right.
[49:18.84]She is carrying, like, the Hornet B helmet.
[49:22.44]Let me just go back here.
[49:23.32]I really should upgrade this again.
[49:32.38]I can... This chest and stuff.
[49:34.08]Let me... Hold on.
[49:34.74]This is a new area.
[49:35.76]Let me not, like, not freak out because I hate fighting this guy.
[49:38.87]Alright, where's the spell where I can turn that guy onto his friend?
[49:50.79]Just get the chest before you get killed.
[49:55.10]Demon Titanite.
[49:55.84]Cool.
[49:57.96]No, not cool.
[50:01.32]Not cool.
[50:01.84]Not cool.
[50:04.02]Is that all that's over there?
[50:04.88]I don't think these guys even matter.
[50:07.43]They were just guarding the... Okay, well, I'm trying to look.
[50:10.13]I'm just trying to look.
[50:21.62]Just go.
[50:22.02]I wanted to get the item.
[50:25.58]There is no just go in this game.
[50:27.54]I'm going to see.
[50:28.74]I want to experience the game.
[50:30.22]I've never seen this before.
[50:32.61]Hurry up.
[50:33.03]Get to the boss quick.
[50:34.97]Skip everything else.
[50:36.15]What the fuck are you doing?
[50:37.49]Go fight Gwyn now.
[50:38.61]You can do it now.
[50:39.47]Do it.
[50:49.58]Why are you not at the boss yet?
[50:50.78]I've seen somebody beat this game in an hour and 12 minutes.
[50:53.30]Why are you not one of them?
[51:09.84]These guys are also guarding two treasure chests.
[51:16.07]I want them.
[51:17.17]I want them.
[51:17.81]So I'm going to get them.
[51:19.05]And you're invulnerable when you open up a chest.
[51:27.72]I'm alive.
[51:28.14]I'm alive.
[51:28.50]I'm alive.
[51:28.84]I'm alive.
[51:29.16]I'm alive.
[51:29.48]I'm alive.
[51:32.64]Invulnerable.
[51:33.10]Get it.
[51:35.52]Twinkling Titanite.
[51:46.66]You are invulnerable when you open a chest.
[51:50.92]It's not one that has teeth.
[51:54.96]Well, now I want to kill that thing.
[52:06.46]I feel like... Yeah, okay.
[52:08.51]There's more over here.
[52:09.29]Hold on.
[52:09.55]Let's pull these guys.
[52:12.95]I'm going to kill the mimic, too.
[52:16.53]These guys need to be hit twice.
[52:17.51]I wonder, will this do me favors here?
[52:20.73]If I do the R2 here.
[52:24.49]Not at all.
[52:25.37]Like, not in the slightest.
[52:26.61]I might not have been close enough, but whatever.
[52:33.87]Just get rid of one of them.
[52:38.76]Too slow.
[52:44.46]Dead.
[52:44.80]Okay.
[52:45.32]Now you.
[52:51.81]Damn it.
[52:52.73]Thought I had enough time.
[52:56.53]Oh my lord.
[52:57.09]I am so bad at fighting these guys.
[52:58.69]This is like the bane of the whole game for me right now.
[53:03.95]These guys, I just can't time them correctly for some reason.
[53:07.04]Alright, let's kill the Mimic.
[53:08.14]3, 2, 1, and...
[53:25.83]Goodbye.
[53:28.37]What did I get?
[53:33.01]Crystal Halberd.
[53:34.03]That's pretty cool.
[53:34.93]Another one of these guys.
[53:41.85]Do you have a sword or do you have a spear?
[53:43.09]It was worth a shot.
[53:50.64]I can't fight these guys.
[53:51.50]I really can't.
[53:52.30]I can't fight you.
[53:56.01]Who's the mutant that can, like, make it so you can't see or can't, like, react?
[53:59.57]There's, like, a mutant that has a power that makes it a Quicksilver.
[54:02.61]These guys are Quicksilver to me, and they're this slow.
[54:04.55]I haven't gotten hit by more of the same fucking guy than this guy.
[54:15.03]No, not Spider-Man.
[54:15.85]I'm talking about the guy that has the fun music.
[54:19.03]They give him a soundtrack, and he does a bunch of crazy shit.
[54:21.09]He, like, eats pizza and, like, goes around and throws people out of windows on a mattress.
[54:25.50]Quicksilver.
[54:31.11]This is a room here.
[54:35.77]I'm not sure what this is.
[54:36.77]This looks like a boss room.
[54:40.59]I guess this is a room.
[54:44.03]Well, fuck it.
[54:44.56]We're here.
[54:45.50]Brilliant light.
[54:49.40]Um...
[54:53.41]We can't even go in here.
[54:54.77]Sealed by the great lord's power.
[55:02.50]That's one of the other bosses.
[55:09.66]Guess I come back here later.
[55:15.15]P-Wall.
[55:15.91]Yeah, the song that plays, he dances around and he put
[55:24.79]I didn't even look at that.
[55:28.29]Who's the frog?
[55:32.65]Well, there was a way to go down.
[55:33.65]Let's just rest at the bonfire again.
[55:46.48]Super frog.
[55:49.16]So we're going to go down.
[55:57.49]Can't level up.
[56:01.65]I so desperately need... I need another one of those... Fire... To make my flask.
[56:08.41]+2.
[56:09.11]Have I not come across any others?
[56:11.33]I feel like I've tried.
[56:12.16]I've been exploring and... Where's this elevator?
[56:17.70]Come on.
[56:23.40]I want it down here.
[56:33.22]No, no, I wanted to do this one.
[56:35.92]What's the one where you jump?
[56:37.35]It's this one.
[56:37.81]Here it is.
[56:40.61]Made it.
[56:41.39]You see that?
[56:42.45]You see that?
[56:42.99]Yeah.
[56:43.47]Fuck yeah!
[56:51.05]Nothing else to do here.
[56:54.91]I like the way this looks.
[56:55.99]That's really cool looking.
[57:07.12]Items.
[57:08.30]I need them.
[57:17.66]Hmm.
[57:20.96]Oh, he's happy to see me.
[57:21.90]Yes, Dad's home from work.
[57:23.72]I can't wait to see...
[57:43.55]Gargoyle helm.
[57:46.05]Ooh.
[57:47.31]Hold on there, boys and girls.
[58:01.42]I finally got my bee helmet!
[58:04.22]Yes!
[58:05.91]It's perfect!
[58:12.17]And it's much better than what I had on, and I'm still mid-rolling, so I'm happy.
[58:28.40]Um... I don't think I can do this.
[58:37.10]I remember this from Dark Souls 3, though.
[58:39.95]Is this place even in Dark Souls 2?
[58:41.39]I don't remember this being in Dark Souls 2.
[58:48.48]I guess not.
[58:49.08]Well, there's a place to go over here.
[58:50.34]Hold on.
[58:53.82]Just jump.
[58:54.70]I'm not gonna jump off.
[59:00.63]I do, like, you can walk up these planks and shit, right?
[59:13.63]Anything else?
[59:18.92]Try jumping.
[59:19.88]No thanks.
[59:20.86]Alright, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[59:24.66]No, you're legit.
[59:25.68]Okay.
[59:25.90]I like the way this...
[59:43.32]I just got a Windows Update thing.
[59:44.42]Hold on.
[60:00.43]Windows Update came back.
[60:02.67]I disabled the service.
[60:05.25]I turned it off.
[60:07.31]I got to make sure this isn't going to restart.
[60:08.97]My only option was wait an hour.
[60:15.15]I need to stop the whole service with like a command prompt.
[60:24.98]This is net stop w u a w u a. And then like you serve, right?
[60:48.30]I hope I don't kill the stream with this.
[60:51.30]Disable it in the registry too.
[60:56.18]Yeah, it's net stop W-U-A-U-S-E-R-V, right?
[61:01.65]That's like the Windows Update Service.
[61:04.49]One of you guys that does a lot of extra computer time, if you could like reiterate that that's what it is.
[61:09.05]That's like the Windows Update Service, right?
[61:29.87]Sounds good to be.
[61:39.03]Okay.
[61:41.98]So we should be alright.
[61:50.16]Yeah, that's it.
[61:51.02]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[62:02.50]The Windows Update service is stopping.
[62:04.63]The Windows Update service could not be stopped.
[62:11.43]What kind of 80s horror movie is this?
[62:13.99]Why is this an 80s horror villain?
[62:15.98]What are you talking about?
[62:17.10]Computers don't say that.
[62:22.46]Computers don't say that.
[62:23.88]Whatever.
[62:35.03]Okay, so apparently, for some reason, the stream's been live for one hour.
[62:40.60]I need you guys to remind me because I will be in a boss fight.
[62:44.60]At exactly 55 minutes, I need a reminder here from you guys because I'm not going to go in a boss store.
[62:58.69]Make sure I'm not fighting a boss in 55 minutes.
[63:05.63]Alright, got it.
[63:06.61]Check.
[63:09.21]55 minutes.
[63:09.53]Now computing.
[63:10.19]Okay.
[63:13.77]Let's go back to playing.
[63:18.41]A whole lot of nothing up here.
[63:19.64]Really?
[63:23.36]There's nothing over here?
[63:25.64]Come on.
[63:26.02]Really?
[63:27.74]I know I have to like... Maybe I just can't come here yet.
[63:32.16]I don't think I can be here yet.
[63:36.71]I guess I just can't be here yet.
[63:41.77]No.
[63:42.17]Alright, well let's just go back.
[63:50.37]Unless I die.
[63:50.99]I feel like in Dark Souls 3, there was a thing you turn.
[63:53.57]No, I'm not going to die if I do that.
[64:07.59]I need to find a thing you turn.
[64:08.71]Because there's nothing else down here.
[64:15.11]I mean, honest to God, honest to God, this is the right thing to do.
[64:18.38]Honest to God, I know it is.
[64:20.00]I've seen this level before in Dark Souls 3 that you walk up these weird things.
[64:26.64]Honest to God, I knew it.
[64:27.74]I knew it.
[64:31.99]You did this in Dark Souls 3, so why wouldn't you do it in Dark Souls original?
[64:41.12]This is an awkward fall, though.
[64:42.90]I'm dead.
[64:43.96]Wow.
[64:45.24]Take your vitamins, always, because that's how you make a jump like that.
[64:52.38]If I never played Dark Souls 3, I never would have done that.
[64:54.47]I would not have known to do that.
[64:56.69]Ever.
[64:56.97]In a million years.
[64:58.81]Alright, is that an NPC or what?
[65:05.13]That guy could have been friendly.
[65:05.93]He could have been trying to warn me about something, but that's too soon.
[65:08.09]I'm sorry, man.
[65:14.56]Alright, you're good.
[65:19.08]You move really fast.
[65:22.74]Too bad.
[65:23.52]You think you move fast for the king of all bugs?
[65:32.33]Bumblebee is the smartest, the fastest...
[65:37.90]And the best animal.
[65:39.82]I'm stuck.
[65:40.36]Whatever.
[65:40.70]I'm trying to look around for something to look at.
[65:43.26]I can't make a reference or a shitty joke at the same time.
[65:47.04]Not gonna happen.
[65:51.00]More climbing and walking.
[65:52.04]Well, looks like we got... I can get on the chandelier.
[65:57.38]Oh, dear.
[65:58.18]Nope.
[65:58.70]Don't think that's gonna happen.
[65:59.80]Sorry, guys.
[66:01.46]We're not gonna do it like this.
[66:05.16]Give me the bow or something.
[66:06.88]Sniper crossbow.
[66:10.11]I'm not fucking around here.
[66:11.13]Are you serious?
[66:21.71]Come on.
[66:22.61]I need to aim this.
[66:24.71]I can't aim a crossbow, can I?
[66:35.78]This is bad news.
[66:44.39]Man, I don't like this.
[66:46.18]Oh my god.
[66:46.50]He's coming towards me Shoot him shoot him with the crossbow I'm panicking just don't move Okay, I didn't I didn't I didn't know he they walk towards you I thought he's gonna throw his daggers at me I can kill him from
[67:14.98]I thought he was going to throw shit at me, not run at me.
[67:19.36]I'm putting this on.
[67:23.06]This is definitely a spot to use this.
[67:30.71]I know, but I just panicked.
[67:33.41]Panic sets in, and then what next?
[67:36.79]I was expecting him to throw, not to run.
[67:46.48]Come on, hurry up.
[67:57.18]Because I don't move that far with this.
[67:58.80]I can even one-hand this if I... Yeah, I can one-hand this.
[68:02.90]Don't think I'm going to need to, though.
[68:06.58]I missed the first cycle.
[68:08.22]Oh, well.
[68:09.50]Oh, well.
[68:10.22]It doesn't matter.
[68:12.64]You don't have to be first.
[68:14.62]You just have to do good enough to pass the class.
[68:18.68]You guys should know that by now.
[68:19.78]It's over here.
[68:26.37]Look, a guy that does it first try and a guy that does it in three tries, we both get the certificate that we did it.
[68:31.23]It doesn't say how many tries you did when you beat the Iron Giant.
[68:36.93]It's just, did you beat him?
[68:39.15]Yes or no?
[68:40.29]No one else knows.
[68:41.47]The Steam achievement doesn't say you beat it first try.
[68:43.47]It just says you beat it.
[68:47.83]I'm gonna fuck that up royally one time.
[68:50.86]Trust me.
[68:51.20]Alright, it's one swing.
[68:57.16]This thing is great.
[68:58.08]Why don't I just use this forever?
[69:11.86]Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[69:14.32]Let's see.
[69:14.86]Kyra told me thank you for the 50 big bits, 50 bucks.
[69:20.49]Thank you, dude.
[69:23.07]$50, and they say, Jerma, to kill Windows Update Service, open Task Manager to go to Services, find the PID for Windows Update Service 2, open a command prompt that says Administrator, type Task Kill FPID, PID of what do you serve, you found.
[69:42.63]Alright, that's a lot.
[69:44.10]Hold on.
[69:46.76]And that's how I get access to all of your data.
[69:51.10]Alright, I need a break to do that, though.
[69:53.82]When I go on my first pee break, I'll try to do that.
[69:56.28]But please remind me when we get to 45 minutes from now.
[70:00.42]Okay, I need to get one solid clean hit on the guy, and he's dead.
[70:03.85]I guess I could go... No, I can't go down.
[70:06.61]I'll be stuck there forever.
[70:09.73]I hate this.
[70:12.92]I hate this so much.
[70:13.82]Okay, here he comes.
[70:19.69]And now he doesn't.
[70:21.21]Why are you not running over here now?
[70:23.23]This is the thing I thought you were going to do, that I was preparing for, and you didn't do it last time.
[70:26.85]Now you're doing it.
[70:27.43]Okay, hold on.
[70:32.31]Alright, we're good.
[70:36.47]We're safe.
[70:37.25]Everything is safe.
[70:41.76]I'm so scared.
[70:43.21]I don't want to do this part.
[70:44.37]Can somebody else do this part for me?
[70:47.27]Who has a save file that's at the end of this platform?
[70:55.82]Slow.
[70:57.52]Just take it slow.
[70:58.32]I like this little spot.
[70:59.58]There's more place to stand.
[71:11.04]Should I jump on the... Should I hit the chandelier?
[71:13.04]Can I hit this down?
[71:16.69]You can.
[71:17.05]Okay.
[71:17.37]So that knocks the chandelier.
[71:22.41]Just gotta keep going, man.
[71:24.65]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say right side because it's closer to the ladder that's over there.
[71:32.26]Anything on the left?
[71:33.26]There's a chest over on the left.
[71:35.70]We need to... We're explorers.
[71:36.84]I have to get the shit that's over on the left.
[71:40.50]I have to.
[71:40.90]This is my first playthrough.
[71:43.08]I need to do it.
[71:45.26]Just wait for him to make a mistake, because he will.
[71:55.30]Good.
[71:56.52]That's the tactic.
[71:58.14]That's the strategy.
[71:59.20]I can go this way.
[72:00.26]There's a ladder there.
[72:05.38]That leads to the boss.
[72:09.93]Can I even go over there, though?
[72:11.67]That's a risky move to try to go over there.
[72:13.31]No.
[72:14.33]Let's just go the right way.
[72:18.37]Wait for him to move, and he'll jump off the edge, and then I can finally be safe and open up this shortcut.
[72:26.54]Here he comes, right?
[72:36.41]Whew!
[72:37.25]Alright, I feel good.
[72:38.13]I feel okay now.
[72:42.97]Chest.
[72:45.41]Anywhere else to go?
[72:48.15]I can go over there, but should I go over there right now?
[72:54.29]What about going backwards here?
[72:55.39]Okay, there's a staircase there.
[72:56.49]Alright, now this is the right way.
[73:02.36]I can definitely, I don't have to, I see how this is going to work.
[73:06.28]Just don't fall off.
[73:10.97]Oh my god, I almost fell off.
[73:11.97]Oh my god, my finger just kept pushing over there.
[73:13.83]It's like... I got possessed and got moved.
[73:16.77]I just... I seriously just Ouija boarded this.
[73:20.52]And I almost just walked right off the edge.
[73:23.32]Just over psyching myself up.
[73:24.70]I'm not going in there.
[73:31.70]Alright, let's... We have an opportunity to go down.
[73:33.60]Come on up the stairs, stupid.
[73:46.56]Fast enemies were using the backup throwing knife good Be another one some guys gonna be right here Not quite Shit Shit is this a death if I go down there I
[74:18.44]Is that the only way to go?
[74:19.71]That's the only way I can go, huh?
[74:26.61]I'm going to have to do it.
[74:32.37]Unless I can go from here to there.
[74:35.07]And from there, can I jump through there?
[74:40.23]I just don't know.
[74:43.00]I'm so scared to do this.
[74:51.19]Be yourself.
[75:02.36]Is this not a boss?
[75:18.91]Alright, so this is how to move the thing.
[75:22.45]Alright, we're looking dandy.
[75:24.77]And then this connects back up there, and you go straight up, and that's how you get inside the first floor.
[75:33.04]Cool.
[75:37.64]But before I do that, I do want to see if there's anything down here, because I might not be able to get to this particular... And look at that.
[75:45.12]There's Mr...
[75:48.37]I was going to call him an angry bird.
[75:49.57]I don't know why.
[75:50.03]Any items or any way to go or jump before turning this?
[76:02.02]Delusion.
[76:04.79]No.
[76:07.27]It's just going to bring me back up there.
[76:08.49]Alright, let's spin it.
[76:17.21]They copied this from Dark Souls 3.
[76:18.77]Yeah, what the fuck, man?
[76:21.56]Like, they're gonna reuse content?
[76:24.96]They're gonna put this... This was from Dark Souls 3.
[76:28.94]How dare they put this in Dark Souls 1?
[76:37.74]Why am I not playing online?
[76:39.92]Uh, because I don't want somebody to throw a beach ball at me and have my character get deleted.
[76:43.32]Oh!
[76:47.64]Oh, boy.
[76:48.30]Alright.
[76:48.60]Well, it's pulled.
[77:10.22]My face.
[77:11.14]Let's get some stamina here.
[77:16.32]Oh, that was a turnaround.
[77:17.50]Oh, well.
[77:20.30]This thing is very much... It's only plus 5.
[77:24.86]But I like it.
[77:26.22]I'll probably get this to plus 10, plus 15.
[77:27.90]What can you do?
[77:34.14]There he goes.
[77:34.60]Okay.
[77:38.28]Ooh, Gargoyle's Halberd, Gargoyle's Shield.
[77:42.22]Okay, that's pretty nice.
[77:45.24]Hold on.
[77:45.66]Let's... Bonfire, right?
[77:48.92]Not Bonfire.
[77:49.58]Where the fuck am I?
[77:50.24]I just went all the way up there.
[77:51.26]That's the new door.
[77:53.08]So this goes... Hold on.
[77:54.28]I just want to look around.
[78:07.14]There's a bunch of new areas here.
[78:18.85]Alright, now here we are.
[78:20.97]Beautiful.
[78:22.31]Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[78:23.87]Okay.
[78:29.14]So the butcher's knife is refilling 5 HP per hit.
[78:31.58]Does that get any better or is it just that forever?
[78:38.61]Okay, there are a lot of these guys.
[78:39.61]I really don't want to fuck this up.
[78:40.85]So let's try to pull them one at a time.
[78:42.11]I'm going to play this safe.
[78:46.60]Unless there's some trigger point where I walk and they all run at me.
[78:49.44]In which case, you're going to hear a scream.
[78:58.51]You know what?
[79:00.41]Check this out.
[79:02.57]I would like to show you guys how to play this fucking game for real.
[79:08.70]You want to see how you fucking really play a goddamn video game?
[79:13.62]Check it.
[79:17.76]Tell me if you've ever seen anyone play a video game like this before.
[79:38.10]Okay, I'm getting scared.
[79:40.24]You saw what I was trying to do, now I'm scared to do it.
[79:42.84]I got two of them.
[79:43.70]That's good.
[79:44.18]Two is better than one.
[79:45.80]Two is better than one person getting gotten.
[79:48.63]Don't you think?
[79:50.65]Don't you guys think so?
[80:00.41]Weapons are going to break.
[80:01.13]That's fine.
[80:01.57]I got a backup.
[80:10.30]Painting Guardian Sword?
[80:11.36]There's so many weapons in these games.
[80:15.40]These games can just be played a thousand times and they never get old.
[80:23.37]Okay, more guys.
[80:24.91]I wonder if I can do the same tactic.
[80:27.31]No, it's not worth it.
[80:27.95]There's like a bonfire right here.
[80:29.21]Why would I do this?
[80:32.75]I mean, if I have to pull somebody, I'll pull them.
[80:34.69]I don't need to prove anything to you guys.
[80:38.19]You've already seen me.
[80:39.19]I beat Flamelurker first try.
[80:41.60]What else do I have to prove to you guys?
[80:44.04]Is there much else to prove?
[80:46.88]I beat Champion Gundyr first try.
[80:48.54]Dancer first try.
[80:50.00]What do I do?
[80:50.90]Do you need something else?
[80:52.20]Should I do a fucking card trick?
[81:03.96]Beat the next boss first try.
[81:13.48]What dropped from the chandelier?
[81:14.90]That's what I'm curious about.
[81:19.09]Oh, sorcery.
[81:22.53]Sorcery is a lot of fun.
[81:29.17]Go beat my deer.
[81:31.23]Yeah, that's optional, though.
[81:34.31]I don't have to do that.
[81:35.21]That was a nice move.
[81:37.47]I commend it.
[81:37.89]Really?
[81:39.15]I'm trying to dodge around you.
[81:40.25]Okay, don't blow this.
[81:41.55]You're fucking right here, man.
[81:50.33]Right into it.
[81:51.23]Thank you.
[81:56.21]Black Iron Helm.
[81:58.52]Great sword, black iron, great shield.
[82:01.46]New set and a new weapon.
[82:05.24]And... This thing.
[82:10.03]Whatever it is.
[82:14.01]That's a bridge going into... That's like a really just a bad vacation photo.
[82:29.12]Look at it.
[82:29.68]Look at it.
[82:30.42]I just did.
[82:30.88]I just looked at it.
[82:32.64]I just looked at it.
[82:34.70]Look.
[82:37.28]Oh shit.
[82:54.58]No, I'm not I'm not ready for this shit Don't pull me into the Mario world.
[82:59.68]I don't want to do this right now.
[83:01.26]This is like this is probably DLC or something oh Wait no this this is I know what this is Okay, I want to go back.
[83:11.98]I'd like to go back now
[83:24.61]You fucking jokers.
[83:30.78]This is from Dark Souls 3 as well.
[83:32.14]For the love of God.
[83:35.12]I was like in the middle of doing something.
[83:37.75]Who are you?
[83:38.11]Who are you?
[83:38.45]Okay, I'm fine.
[83:41.59]I have to bone back now and go all through that bullshit again.
[83:44.99]Come on.
[83:45.80]Really?
[84:03.27]Don't die here.
[84:04.16]Don't die here.
[84:05.10]I'm like just trying to examine my surroundings.
[84:07.20]Why wouldn't I just leave?
[84:09.40]Good thing I just got a septuple kill right there.
[84:13.68]I'm getting out of here.
[84:23.73]Bones don't work here.
[84:24.77]Give me a break.
[84:38.41]Why am I actually trapped here?
[84:41.09]You guys, I thought if you don't, you light the bonfire, as long as you don't sit at the bonfire.
[84:49.24]If you don't sit at the bonfire, then if you, were you guys just giving me shit there?
[84:53.34]Was that fucking not real?
[84:57.00]I thought it was if you don't sit at the bonfire, it's not locked to you.
[85:03.71]Why must you guys do this to me?
[85:12.75]Don't touch it at all.
[85:17.71]So I have to, how do I get out of here?
[85:34.86]What if I try to jump out the way I came in?
[85:37.42]Well, alright, looks like I'm... Time to beat the game's first DLC, because we can't go anywhere else.
[85:55.75]Just keep chugging.
[86:02.24]That's fine.
[86:03.42]It's not DLC.
[86:04.44]Oh, well, how come people told me it was DLC?
[86:12.28]I just... I can never trust anything anybody says here.
[86:15.76]Ever.
[86:16.52]You guys want me to trust you?
[86:18.86]How do you expect me to do that?
[86:23.94]Kindle the bonfire.
[86:24.80]Look, there's a boss over there.
[86:25.82]Okay, this is probably going to be one of those areas that...
[86:29.49]I'm gonna Kindle, Kindle, Kindle.
[86:32.00]Kindle Bonfire.
[86:33.58]Smart idea.
[86:41.38]You can trust me.
[86:43.96]Can I?
[86:48.28]Gotta go back and Kindle.
[86:54.39]No, take another one.
[87:08.72]Let's give this a plus 10.
[87:12.10]Somebody invade me.
[87:12.94]You can't... I'm not gonna... No.
[87:14.12]No one's gonna be able to invade me.
[87:18.80]Alright.
[87:19.38]Looks like we're doing this zone.
[87:24.09]Well, I forgot that these guys were here because I rested at the bonfire.
[87:28.41]So, I'm gonna reset it.
[87:29.51]Just... I might as well just go die.
[87:31.86]Because these... I'm gonna... I also... Enough with the nonsense.
[87:38.13]These are... These are small, frail enemies.
[87:40.39]I really should get this upgraded, though.
[87:47.59]It's so necessary.
[87:59.51]Alright.
[87:59.79]These guys... I don't need the big one for this.
[88:01.21]Can I open this door?
[88:01.85]No.
[88:03.55]So that's the shortcut to whatever is over there.
[88:08.31]Have to go around the right.
[88:09.25]I do like this place, though, so I'm not... You know what?
[88:10.79]I'm happy you guys told me to press this.
[88:13.05]This might be actual progression through where I needed to go.
[88:17.02]I'm alright.
[88:17.70]This is fine.
[88:18.52]I like the snow.
[88:20.24]It's an interesting concept.
[88:22.90]You know, water evaporates into the clouds, and when it gets cold enough, the water condensates back down to Earth as ice crystals.
[88:32.42]And I do think the concept is interesting, so I'm okay with being here.
[88:45.87]I want the items, so we're going over here.
[88:53.93]Whoa!
[88:57.99]Alright, we got heart people.
[89:05.80]Now you're going to throw living... Oh, no!
[89:08.60]I was going to say, are you going to throw living, breathing organs at me?
[89:11.02]Why?
[89:11.54]I didn't know...
[89:13.20]Do I have any more?
[89:13.90]No.
[89:14.70]Oh, god damn it.
[89:17.06]God damn it.
[89:20.71]Just go as far as I can.
[89:21.61]Item run.
[89:22.03]I'm not gonna... Just heal through it.
[89:24.05]Item run.
[89:30.52]You see?
[89:30.90]Item, pick it up.
[89:31.96]Nothing else matters.
[89:34.06]See?
[89:34.26]There's an item over there.
[89:35.14]Item run.
[89:35.66]Get it.
[89:44.35]Didn't get it.
[89:48.23]Can I even do it from here?
[89:49.64]Probably not.
[89:58.56]I bet you I have to fall from a different place.
[90:02.88]No.
[90:03.22]Oh, well.
[90:04.48]Well, we're in here, so let's just go down.
[90:07.74]Wait, what if I take off some of this armor?
[90:16.66]Shit.
[90:20.14]No, I don't want this.
[90:20.66]I want this.
[90:24.98]What else is even down here?
[90:25.96]A fucking fancy rat.
[90:28.26]That's fine.
[90:32.63]Souls.
[90:33.09]That's good.
[90:33.63]Souls.
[90:34.07]Just make sure I don't die before I go back and... Are you still... Are you alive over here?
[90:40.83]I guess you are.
[90:43.93]That's it.
[90:44.35]It was just a soul...
[90:48.60]This is also why I don't have to come back down here when I eventually go back.
[90:51.18]But I really want to get that, though.
[91:00.76]How do I... I probably can get up there a different way.
[91:03.02]Well, let's just keep going.
[91:05.22]Item over there.
[91:05.86]That's a guy you chop down.
[91:07.13]Fine.
[91:07.79]I'll do it.
[91:08.19]Might as well just get toxic from everything.
[91:12.17]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[91:25.85]I died from the Toxic.
[91:36.28]That was stupid.
[91:37.28]I turned around and just hit the wall.
[91:39.10]Alright.
[91:40.86]Well, here we go.
[91:41.70]Don't kill those guys and stand near them.
[91:48.42]Just restart it.
[91:49.36]Restart it.
[91:50.40]I wasn't... Restart.
[91:52.28]Fresh start.
[91:52.84]Do it again.
[92:01.91]Just fresh restarted.
[92:14.22]Why did chat do this?
[92:15.30]I'm legit sad.
[92:17.81]Because they like to watch a guy who's never played before through here to get stuck at this part.
[92:28.00]Because they knew I was on a progression and they knew that I wasn't going to be happy about this.
[92:31.70]And they have an LOL, fucking LUL moment.
[92:38.61]I can go up here.
[92:52.39]Whatever, I'm going to first try this boss.
[92:56.27]Whoever it is.
[92:59.44]They're dead.
[92:59.82]I need to go back to the blacksmith.
[93:07.23]There's so much to do.
[93:09.47]There's so much to see.
[93:12.57]So chat, please.
[93:15.05]Get on with the backseat.
[93:20.72]What the fuck is this bird person?
[93:26.22]What in the name of God happened?
[93:28.04]Did I just kill her?
[93:40.36]Is that the lyrics?
[93:41.16]So what's wrong with taking the backseat?
[93:44.14]So what's wrong with being in the backseat?
[93:48.69]So much to see, so much to sew.
[93:51.11]So what's wrong with being in the backseat?
[93:54.75]You'll never know if you don't get in the backseat.
[93:58.69]You'll never drive here in the backseat.
[94:01.23]Okay, I'm panicking.
[94:02.85]I'm panicking right now.
[94:04.09]This is panic.
[94:05.25]You're seeing it.
[94:14.88]Let me go up.
[94:21.08]Oh, fuck you.
[94:26.00]How do I say fuck you in every language, man?
[94:27.82]Don't you ever, like, want to know?
[94:36.16]How do you say fuck you in, like... Hold on.
[94:43.72]Well, that didn't work.
[94:46.59]Okay, now that I have a second, just slow down here so I can at least see where I am.
[94:50.80]Picking up a lot of random shit.
[94:55.30]I can go there.
[94:56.18]What the hell was that?
[94:59.98]No, don't think so.
[95:03.54]This place is really weird.
[95:07.51]Seems like there's a lot of random little tiny roads and nooks and crannies to go in.
[95:11.55]Am I going to die if I fall down there?
[95:14.89]Maybe.
[95:15.17]I don't know.
[95:17.43]Definitely not there.
[95:20.39]I'll die there.
[95:21.02]Maybe I have to go down there.
[95:34.46]These guys are just waiting for me to... Okay, I think I have to go over here.
[95:37.78]There's no other place to go.
[95:38.62]Alright.
[95:43.94]There's a door down there.
[95:46.76]Um... My feet are probably so cold right now.
[96:01.15]I'm just realizing this.
[96:03.31]There's rats in here.
[96:12.56]Painting Guardian Hood.
[96:13.84]Another set.
[96:14.18]Where the fuck am I?
[96:26.22]Where am I?
[96:30.96]I have no idea what's going on.
[96:35.08]I guess there's an empty room here.
[96:40.98]No illusions or anything?
[96:51.61]Trapped in the Mario painting forever.
[96:53.13]It's alright.
[97:01.32]Is somebody behind me now?
[97:02.30]No.
[97:07.40]Okay, if I were a boss, I would look like that.
[97:14.47]I really don't want to die here, though, because this is so confusing that I don't really know where the hell I would even come back from.
[97:24.01]A lot of these sell the Brave Warrior, though, which is good.
[97:28.85]I'm going to go and hug this wall.
[97:34.77]This is where the toxic people were.
[97:36.47]Where do you think you're going?
[97:48.64]Okay, well.
[97:52.80]Wow.
[97:53.44]Hold it.
[97:53.68]How am I still falling?
[97:54.94]Fall.
[97:55.34]Don't fall.
[97:56.70]Holy shit.
[97:59.26]Egg verbiage.
[98:04.13]Where the fuck am I going?
[98:05.23]Is it going through the window?
[98:06.31]I guess I'm going this way.
[98:16.01]Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.
[98:17.78]No, don't.
[98:22.34]Ooh, another way.
[98:22.90]That can go down to the left.
[98:23.92]Left.
[98:25.34]I was already in that room.
[98:26.32]And I didn't kill any of those things.
[98:27.30]That's why they're all there.
[98:27.98]Can I go up?
[98:35.36]I guess I can go this way.
[98:38.21]All the way up in this black night up here, right?
[98:43.17]I know it's gonna happen.
[98:44.99]Might as well be one.
[98:45.65]They're all coming up here.
[98:51.78]Alright, I got it.
[98:52.32]I killed her.
[98:53.48]Okay, slow down.
[98:54.66]I'm being chased by everybody.
[98:59.28]Uh... Oh, wait a minute.
[99:01.78]Wait a minute.
[99:02.30]Wait a minute.
[99:02.92]It ends.
[99:05.07]Wait a minute.
[99:06.23]Hold on.
[99:06.79]Don't... Can I make this jump?
[99:09.17]I'm going for it.
[99:11.97]Um... Wait a minute.
[99:13.61]Um... Safe.
[99:23.55]Oh, there's an item there!
[99:27.99]Are they dead?
[99:28.39]I think they're gone.
[99:36.67]Okay, I'm safe.
[99:46.66]Another soul.
[99:47.14]Good.
[99:47.54]I'm glad I got it.
[99:49.16]So I got the invasion stone thing.
[99:52.90]Alright, let's be safe.
[99:59.80]That's it.
[100:00.54]Back down.
[100:01.56]No windows or anything that I've missed out on or something?
[100:05.11]Random spots to fall down or look down?
[100:07.91]That's an illusion wall, isn't it?
[100:09.69]Why would that be an illusion wall?
[100:10.95]What are you talking about?
[100:14.01]I'm overthinking all this.
[100:15.31]Here comes another guy.
[100:24.19]Oh shit, she's still alive.
[100:29.75]I don't even know what the hell you guys are all still doing in here.
[100:35.71]Alright, they left the room, so this is not going to kill me.
[100:44.02]Just be careful.
[100:44.76]And there's a bridge over there that I can go to.
[100:48.98]Just going to get out of here.
[100:49.78]Oh!
[100:51.78]There it is.
[100:53.66]Oh.
[100:54.64]Oh no!
[100:55.50]Oh my god, you have a lot of health.
[101:15.62]You hit so fucking hard.
[101:24.91]Get me around you.
[101:30.87]I can't open this door.
[101:33.79]You've got to be kidding me.
[101:34.99]This looks like the front entrance.
[101:40.93]Oh, no.
[101:43.42]There's the boss room right there.
[101:44.90]Has to be.
[101:55.71]I want to open this door.
[102:02.40]There has to be some way to skip this.
[102:04.28]I need to take a look.
[102:14.13]Because there was another way to go besides that way.
[102:19.35]There's items and shit.
[102:21.49]Oh my god.
[102:35.66]Why is that thing getting up?
[102:38.02]Oh my God.
[102:38.47]Wait a minute.
[102:39.19]Oh my God.
[102:40.17]Oh my God.
[102:41.29]Oh my God.
[102:44.01]What is he doing here?
[102:45.09]Why is he here?
[102:48.25]Did he wake up?
[102:51.25]What do I do?
[102:51.71]How do I get away from him?
[102:53.41]What do I do?
[102:53.81]I have to get away from him.
[102:55.70]How do I get away from him?
[103:00.98]Oh, fuck.
[103:07.50]He's not still trying to come in here, is he?
[103:25.35]What the fuck?
[103:26.25]I thought I... I have one, don't I?
[103:31.34]Thank God.
[103:33.28]Thank the heavens.
[103:42.87]No, these stupid shitty controls.
[104:15.44]Oh, he shoots puke down here.
[104:21.44]I can't even... Why is it going all the way down the stairs?
[104:32.02]Can I even go now?
[104:34.58]I don't think I can even go anywhere.
[104:41.67]Oh, here comes the Windows update.
[104:42.73]Alright.
[104:45.55]Where do I go from here?
[104:46.63]Up and to the left?
[104:48.67]He needs to kill that lady.
[104:52.21]Please kill that lady.
[104:59.70]Go into the fog.
[105:01.58]So this is not a boss room?
[105:03.02]I thought this would be a boss room all the way down here.
[105:12.14]Shit, it's not.
[105:12.79]Okay.
[105:12.95]Okay.
[105:52.85]There are so many things.
[105:53.79]There are so many people here.
[105:54.81]Is this a bad idea?
[106:28.80]Machine gun.
[106:29.72]Oh god fucking damn it.
[106:31.54]Whatever Good luck getting back there.
[106:40.46]I can't wait.
[106:44.70]I Have so many souls over there don't just God
[106:49.10]I've got to remember how to even do this.
[106:50.30]This place is such a mess.
[106:51.45]I've got to go up and then in.
[106:54.25]Which way was that?
[107:00.63]Up and around here?
[107:01.35]I don't even fucking remember.
[107:07.37]I'm busy not trying to panic.
[107:16.97]Get your body out of the way.
[107:18.41]No, I'm supposed to go this way.
[107:20.47]You asshole, really?
[107:25.88]This brings me down, and then... I just gotta get to that bridge area, which is over here.
[107:39.67]Right?
[107:40.17]I don't fucking... I don't remember.
[107:41.53]I really don't.
[107:43.79]I'm pretty sure I'm going the right way.
[107:47.57]I don't kill these guys for any reason.
[107:51.45]This brings me to the bridge.
[107:52.59]There's the undead dragon.
[107:54.15]Yep, okay.
[107:58.53]Back down.
[108:00.61]Into here.
[108:02.69]Alright, we're back where we were.
[108:06.57]Now that I have Estus, I'm going to just go through.
[108:08.33]I'm just going to walk down there.
[108:16.36]I mean, how the hell am I supposed to know what I'm doing here?
[108:18.46]Unless there's... Maybe there's aggro's.
[108:20.48]I'm gonna go straight ahead.
[108:21.16]I'm gonna run right to the front door there.
[108:24.09]Oh, my god!
[108:24.65]Don't run to the front door yet.
[108:25.81]Wait till they disperse.
[108:29.55]Maybe I can pull them.
[108:35.31]No.
[108:35.97]Stop doing that.
[108:36.99]This controller is so bad.
[108:39.95]Sometimes when I press down on the D-pad, it... Alright, shut up.
[108:43.40]Put it into hand!
[108:50.69]Come on, I know this is gonna work.
[108:52.58]I know this is gonna work.
[108:57.22]Wait till they all get up here.
[109:02.50]Do it!
[109:05.74]I don't care, I'm gonna break the weapon.
[109:19.51]What happens if the weapon breaks?
[109:21.77]Jerma, get the thing to repair on the fly.
[109:23.33]Jerma, get the thing that repairs on the fly.
[109:32.80]And I didn't even get it.
[109:45.85]Takes him a while to turn around, doesn't it?
[109:49.06]I'm gonna pull him up here.
[109:54.18]What the fuck?
[109:58.72]I need to just get in there.
[109:59.72]Oh my god, please, really?
[110:16.05]How on Earth were you supposed to do this?
[110:20.04]Apparently I'm getting hit.
[110:20.70]There's so many of them.
[110:30.59]Just run?
[110:31.05]I mean, I kind of can't now.
[110:34.87]I've sort of ruined that chance.
[110:48.49]That's so useless.
[110:53.46]Eat shit!
[111:00.36]I almost had it.
[111:15.83]Oh, fuck, okay.

[112:42.86]Are they respawning?
[112:44.26]Somebody just said they've respawned.
[112:48.42]I will shit my pants if that's true.
[112:53.24]No, they're not.

[113:32.63]They actually are spawning off each other, I think.
[113:38.90]Get out of my way.
[113:39.38]Out of my way.
[113:39.76]I don't have time for this shit.
[113:49.57]Oh my fucking god.

[114:47.95]Nope.
[114:53.15]No, I don't think so.
[114:54.03]I don't think so.
[115:02.56]All they needed to show me was that blurry hallway with the item and a guy turn around.
[115:07.08]I don't believe I'm going to do that.

[116:37.19]I've got 30,000 souls.
[116:39.17]Here it comes.
[116:52.50]Just uninstall Windows.
[116:53.87]I wish I could.
[116:58.41]Here it comes.
[117:03.39]Disable Windows update?
[117:04.45]I did.
[117:05.55]I've done it like eight times.
[117:11.82]My Windows is corrupted.
[117:15.70]I have to do a fresh install of Windows.
[117:17.22]I already looked it up.
[117:28.52]Come on, where is it?
[117:29.30]It's like right now.
[117:40.09]I don't have a pirated version of Windows.
[117:42.27]If I do, that would be a big surprise.
[117:44.97]Alright, come on.
[117:45.59]Where is it?
[117:51.96]Fresh soft install?
[117:53.34]Yeah, I mean, I have to do like a... I have to re... Whatever the reset process is where I have to delete everything except for my documents.
[118:03.41]It should have happened by now.
[118:04.27]Why has it not happened yet?
[118:15.18]It should have happened by now.
[118:23.40]I'm afraid to move.
[118:24.30]This is... Corrupted update.
[118:30.02]Yeah, that's why I didn't do it, because I was too... That little save file that's in my folder...
[118:40.10]That little save file, that's a Dark Souls save file.
[118:42.64]I'm terrified that if I just pull that out, it's gonna be not gonna work.
[118:46.40]That's why I didn't do it.
[118:48.43]Alright, this is it.
[118:49.19]It's time to go.
[118:49.71]I think we missed it.
[118:54.19]We're almost at two hours completely.
[118:55.63]Well, wasn't it one hour and three minutes?
[119:01.23]This is so stupid.
[119:03.41]I can't believe I'm sitting here.
[119:10.05]Windows 10 is a thing where it won't pop up mid-game.
[119:12.02]Oh, it does.
[119:12.82]It does.
[119:13.16]Trust me.
[119:20.56]Come on.
[119:21.14]Do it.
[119:24.76]Just quit.
[119:25.24]Alright.
[119:25.98]For the people that weren't here, that don't know what I'm referring to here, I have a fucked up corrupted version of Windows right now.
[119:34.87]I've had the same update to install that will not install.
[119:38.43]It keeps telling me I need to restart my computer no matter what I do.
[119:42.01]I've disabled Windows Update.
[119:43.65]I've done virus scans.
[119:45.41]I've looked this up.
[119:46.07]I've done a lot of research.
[119:47.05]I just have to do a fresh install of Windows.
[119:49.83]So I can't disable this.
[119:51.37]I can't stop it.
[119:52.67]I've tried everything.
[119:54.92]This April 2018 fucking Windows feature update has taken over my computer completely.
[120:05.62]And I cannot do it.
[120:06.90]It keeps telling me, oh, well, your update's done.
[120:08.86]Restart your computer.
[120:10.38]And I restart my computer.
[120:11.72]Oh, well, the update failed.
[120:13.20]Please restart your computer to do it again.
[120:15.34]No, I don't want to do that.
[120:16.34]Well, you know, the update failed.
[120:17.28]We're going to try it again.
[120:18.30]No, disable Windows update.
[120:19.74]Okay, you disabled Windows update.
[120:21.36]Did you restart the computer since saying to do that?
[120:24.00]Yes, I have.
[120:24.60]Well, you know, you have to do the Windows 10 April 2018 feature update.
[120:27.80]I don't want to do that.
[120:28.40]Well, restart your computer just to be sure.
[120:30.36]Okay, I'm going to restart my computer.
[120:31.76]Okay, doing the update.
[120:33.68]The update failed.
[120:35.33]Now, I don't want, just disable it completely in the registry.
[120:43.58]Where is it?
[120:44.14]It should have popped up by now.
[120:52.02]Directly, I've tried to do the manual install as well.
[120:56.49]I've downloaded the manual install package with a fresh... I've renamed all the... to .old.
[121:02.54]I've renamed the old... I've deleted the old cache files.
[121:05.64]It doesn't work.
[121:11.58]Come on.
[121:12.36]Where is it?
[121:13.44]If it doesn't show up in the next 60 seconds, it's not going to happen.
[121:16.52]Okay, I'm just going to go for the shortcut door.
[121:18.04]Where is it?
[121:18.40]Right there?
[121:18.94]That big door is the shortcut door?
[121:22.64]Well, that's where I came out of.
[121:29.36]Reset your router.
[121:34.38]Windows, please do it.
[121:35.61]I know you're going to do it.
[121:36.29]It said wait an hour and it's been an hour.
[121:39.05]At two hours and three minutes on the stream.
[121:42.50]If it doesn't show up.
[121:43.72]It's right underneath me.
[122:00.73]I don't have arms.
[122:02.87]I really am just like a bee with this thing in my hands.
[122:05.24]10 seconds.
[122:09.16]203.
[122:09.78]It's not here.
[122:13.44]Okay, that's it.
[122:14.46]That means it's not going to happen.
[122:16.38]I'm going.
[122:26.89]I'm so paranoid.
[122:27.79]I'm still waiting for it.
[122:30.89]No, I already went down there.
[122:45.33]Okay, it doesn't even matter if it happens.
[122:46.83]I got the shortcut.
[122:57.75]Okay.
[122:58.83]I don't know why it doesn't happen.
[123:01.46]I could have ran back to the bonfire by now.
[123:04.68]Probably.
[123:06.48]Alright, so are we about to hit the... Are we at the soft cap of strength?
[123:10.00]Or is it 40?
[123:10.58]I feel like I need to just keep doing endurance from now on.
[123:22.63]Is it 50 or 40 is the soft cap?
[123:24.43]40?
[123:24.71]Okay.
[123:27.69]So we can just nonchalantly get there.
[123:29.83]I do want endurance.
[123:35.64]I'll do Endurance and then I'll crack a skull open and get 99 for optimal build.
[123:45.97]Maybe you could say that.
[123:46.71]I have a lot of these.
[123:47.51]I think we only need to use one though.
[123:56.13]I want more Endurance.
[123:56.83]I want to get that to like 30.
[124:04.84]You want all endurance.
[124:06.00]It still doesn't happen.
[124:06.82]This is concerning me.
[124:09.96]It's gonna... It said wait an hour and guess what?
[124:13.20]You know, you understand this is gonna pop up in like 45 fucking minutes?
[124:18.20]Reset it.
[124:18.71]Start it over.
[124:22.43]Use all my souls.
[124:23.27]You have no balls.
[124:26.39]Did that actually... Come on.
[124:32.85]This is not going to be good.
[124:34.13]I need to... This is only a plus 5 weapon.
[124:38.65]I really cannot afford to have the... That weapon break.
[124:42.39]There's a lot of items over here.
[124:45.83]Alright, item run.
[124:46.43]Don't fall.
[124:54.94]Don't die.
[125:02.93]Please oh, please please item run god damn it.
[125:06.27]Fuck you windows Sitting here with my asshole clenched waiting for them to click a button because I have a corrupted version of Windows I
[125:30.06]Because Microsoft doesn't understand how to deploy updates to all their software.
[125:35.42]Oh, did we brick like 100,000 computers?
[125:37.82]Well, whoops.
[125:38.79]Just tell them to like fucking reinstall Windows on their own time.
[125:53.21]Alright, there's no more item brown.
[125:54.43]Let's see.
[125:54.77]Anything else there?
[125:55.59]Doesn't look like it.
[126:05.94]You can hear the clenching through the mic.
[126:09.40]I'm sure you can.
[126:09.92]Alright, there's nothing else over here?
[126:11.95]That's it.
[126:12.33]There's no other fun thing to do over here?
[126:16.01]I guess not.
[126:18.61]Well, we're going back.
[126:25.49]There's only one other way to go.
[126:30.13]That's over... I mean, I could go this way.
[126:32.74]Let's try over here.
[126:37.99]Now, oh, I forgot there's a lot of guys throwing spears there.
[126:41.67]Oh, I could go down and try to, you know what, let's go, I want to go fight that guy down there.
[126:44.87]I'm not afraid.
[126:55.85]Wait, secret.
[126:57.92]Secret.
[127:03.60]I want to get that, whatever it is.
[127:15.59]Starts to panic roll.
[127:19.15]Yes, I did.
[127:19.79]That's because I forgot that there were a bunch of slimes with spears.
[127:26.17]Where was that?
[127:27.37]I was panicking.
[127:28.09]I forgot where it was.
[127:30.82]Over here.
[127:31.20]Straight ahead.
[127:33.08]Right there.
[127:37.26]Just dodged into that somehow.
[127:39.72]Another Soul of a Brave Warrior.
[127:41.26]I'll take it.
[127:44.93]Nothing else, right?
[127:46.73]Uh-huh.
[127:53.40]See that?
[127:55.30]That's what we call juking somebody out of the way.
[128:01.56]Ring of sacrifice.
[128:04.14]Okay, I'm gonna go fight that guy.
[128:18.19]This is not a fat roll, is it?
[128:20.65]No.
[128:21.43]Not quite.
[128:24.61]Where was that dude over here?
[128:25.79]Down to the... Down there.
[128:27.69]I'm going to wait.
[128:30.17]This one skeleton is going to screw this whole thing up.
[128:33.03]Yeah, I'm not going to have that happen.
[128:34.13]I'm going to mid-fight.
[128:35.93]All of a sudden this stupid guy is going to come down and stab me in the back.
[128:40.57]Okay, let's go fight this thing.
[128:46.28]Alright.
[128:47.85]What is it?
[128:48.21]Alright, okay, so that... These guys turn into tires and run you over with their car.
[129:08.10]Interesting.
[129:12.60]There looks to be a lot of them down there, so I should prepare.
[129:19.55]Can you even stagger them when they're like that?
[129:20.99]I feel like you can't.
[129:24.01]Let's try it again.
[129:33.50]Slide.
[129:41.82]I can pull one of the... Okay, got one, got one.
[129:48.77]Does that not hurt him?
[129:51.49]I was doing no damage to him.
[129:54.93]Didn't drop anything?
[129:55.53]Alright, well there's one.
[129:59.25]Get out of here!
[130:00.09]Get out of here, you fucking pinball machine!
[130:01.78]Another one right, right there.
[130:05.74]Another one, right there.
[130:17.62]Safe.
[130:19.40]Just stay on the corners.
[130:20.92]That's all I'm going to do.
[130:23.48]Wait till they're all gone.
[130:27.03]There he is.
[130:35.85]Got it.
[130:41.49]These guys look bigger than the other ones.
[130:45.29]Nope.
[130:45.73]Same size.
[130:53.10]This is the underground area from Dark Souls 3.
[130:57.07]It is.
[130:57.99]It is.
[131:01.21]I'm cleaning everybody out here.
[131:02.39]Okay, is that the master of the wheel?
[131:07.47]There's a guy over there.
[131:14.54]Solo Proud Knight., there's another item over there.
[131:17.68]This guy's lit up.
[131:19.52]Does he have two of them?
[131:21.24]Is he double wheeled?
[131:22.41]No.
[131:26.82]Forgive my ignorance here.
[131:33.14]Alright.
[131:34.18]I did it.
[131:37.76]Is there anything else to see here besides this?
[131:42.04]Whatever was hiding back here is now mine.
[131:44.22]Just a soul.
[131:46.97]Well, there's this.
[131:50.07]Of course, that, that's an illusion.
[131:51.29]Hold on.
[131:55.47]That's going back up.
[131:59.96]Further along we go.
[132:00.98]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[132:06.99]Okay.
[132:10.69]Just keep the shield up.
[132:15.63]Yep, I knew it.
[132:24.76]I'm not going to get torn apart here.
[132:26.40]That would be such a bad move.
[132:29.64]Just keep it forward facing.
[132:34.88]No guy over here.
[132:40.50]Annex key.
[132:43.52]Interesting.
[132:45.38]Annex key.
[132:54.13]That just wraps around again.
[132:55.47]I can go left.
[133:00.25]Is that a guy?
[133:00.71]That looks like another wheel.
[133:08.38]Oh my god.
[133:08.90]Don't panic here.
[133:10.22]Don't panic.
[133:10.62]Just rank.
[133:12.88]I ate too many hits.
[133:13.58]Oh my god.
[133:14.18]I'm fine.
[133:25.06]Probably something else in here.
[133:31.35]That turn.
[133:34.49]His brain doesn't contain this information.
[133:36.63]What do you mean my brain doesn't contain this information?
[133:41.75]This is a scary place.
[133:45.75]There's nothing down here.
[133:46.73]It's just a dead end.
[133:47.59]That's all this was.
[133:49.03]Was it just to get that annex key or is there anything else here?
[133:51.17]Oh.
[133:52.45]Now wait a minute.
[133:57.34]This is different.
[134:02.10]What?
[134:02.28]Where the hell am I?
[134:07.56]Is this just... Wait a minute.
[134:11.38]What?
[134:13.68]Oh, okay.
[134:14.34]I understand.
[134:14.78]It's just a shortcut.
[134:18.00]Did I miss anything down here, though?
[134:28.73]Where's my lantern?
[134:29.57]I need a lamp.
[134:35.50]Oh, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!
[134:42.50]I'm dead.
[134:43.22]Oh, why did I change the shield?
[134:44.74]Why did I change out the shield?
[134:46.46]God, why?
[134:48.91]Did I switch to two-hander?
[134:50.71]I just, like, slipped and pressed the button.
[134:53.43]Ugh!
[134:57.19]I, like, I was pressing... I was gonna... Oh, my God.
[135:00.62]What the fuck?
[135:02.46]How angering.
[135:03.60]How infuriating.
[135:09.28]There's no reason to ever have this weapon in two-handed down here.
[135:11.74]Just seriously.
[135:13.12]What in the name of... I'm so pissed off.
[135:20.43]Is he behind me?
[135:27.63]You know, it would help if this thing was upgraded at all.
[135:32.43]It'd be nice if this thing wasn't plus five right now, instead of like plus fucking nine.
[135:38.46]I'm like stuck here.
[135:39.34]I can't even go back to fucking Grendel, whatever his name is.
[135:42.86]What's the black six?
[135:43.82]What's his name?
[135:46.96]Andy?
[135:58.26]He's dead.
[135:58.74]God, die.
[136:01.47]Where was that?
[136:02.03]I was over here.
[136:02.65]No, it was the other way.
[136:16.15]He's right here.
[136:16.83]Okay, don't let that happen again.
[136:21.37]This corner sucks, like really... Kill him before he does it again!
[136:29.57]I'm fine.
[136:37.13]What's this?
[136:37.87]Somewhere...
[136:43.74]What is going on here?
[136:46.30]Can you see me?
[136:50.81]There's no ladder there.
[136:51.49]I thought there was a ladder.
[136:57.98]Why is he not hostile?
[136:58.90]What's going on?
[137:11.87]Why can I not talk to him?
[137:12.67]He's an NPC.
[137:13.33]I can't talk to him.
[137:13.91]He doesn't know where else to go.
[137:50.08]He's a... Take it off.
[137:54.02]What do you mean, take it off?
[138:01.09]I'm not going to kill him.
[138:02.59]I feel like he's useful somewhere, but... Is that all I can do down here?
[138:08.93]There's so many twists and turns.
[138:15.33]I need to be going the right way.
[138:20.40]is just oh no you guys respond oh my fucking god damn it holy mother in heaven hallowed be thy name holy kingdom come holy god oh I'm gonna dead end

[138:51.44]I don't wanna be down here anymore.
[138:52.64]I don't wanna be in this place.
[138:54.71]This place is awful.
[139:04.23]The guys that spin and do 500 swings at you.
[139:20.12]It's like God It's wrong way, I thought he came from that way And I can't even swing down here this is such a disaster I Just hit the fucking wall.
[139:40.89]Oh God, I'm Great, this is just great.
[139:44.73]Oh

[139:50.07]Can you see?
[139:50.69]I'm not going to open this yet.
[140:00.45]I want to see something else to do down here.
[140:06.52]Where is this guy?
[140:12.12]That's the same guy that I fought before.
[140:13.34]I would love to lock onto him.
[140:14.58]Let me lock onto him.

[143:44.15]That's 10,000 souls.
[143:45.45]I'm going to go level up now.
[143:46.59]That's a lot of souls to just get.
[143:57.60]Okay, I can hear them spinning around.
[143:58.92]I really thought they were coming up the stairs.
[144:12.92]Go down there and teach them a lesson.
[144:18.62]Okay.
[144:19.76]Let me see.
[144:20.14]What do I need?
[144:21.42]16,000.

[144:27.74]One of these.
[144:28.34]One more.
[144:37.41]What does this thing?
[144:37.89]Removes parasitic egg from body.
[144:39.93]Weird.

[145:10.07]Straight through here.
[145:10.73]Mm-hmm.
[145:18.71]You're all aiming at me.
[145:19.49]That's fine.
[145:20.13]Alright.
[145:21.47]New spot.
[145:22.97]I see a boss door all the way at the end.
[145:30.12]Everyone's screaming.
[145:30.74]Everyone's saying, become human.
[145:36.55]Why would I want to be human here?
[145:56.25]Disperse.
[145:56.95]Disperse.
[146:02.49]Stream it again.
[146:03.47]Stream Detroit become human again.
[146:06.98]Why?
[146:07.26]There's an invader that drops a funny bee hat down there.
[146:18.30]Well, how am I supposed to know that?
[146:22.75]Everyone's yelling at me for information I never had in the first place.
[146:28.39]What in the name of God are you fucking a guy's all doing here?
[146:41.62]Hold on easy, buddy.
[146:48.24]Oh Shit I didn't need to switch with this.
[146:49.60]I forgot I'm not using the stupid dragon sword anymore.
[146:51.62]God damn it These little tiny little things have fucking pissed me off.
[146:57.59]These little stupid things that I do sometimes.
[147:01.07]Just my brain is so used to not using it.
[147:02.96]Oh, that was too long.
[147:10.83]Oh, that hurts.
[147:12.35]I probably would have killed him too.
[147:34.33]And there's a... Is there a reason why that's not happening there?
[147:44.85]I don't... I don't know.
[147:47.52]Oh, he can't be buried in riposte.
[147:50.58]Whatever that word is.
[147:57.12]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[148:00.72]Please.
[148:06.25]Alright, so you want me to go get the bee hat?
[148:08.01]I go become human and then go stand in the graveyard and get invaded and get a bee hat?
[148:16.25]Alright, I'm wearing a bee hat.
[148:17.51]This thing's like a bee.
[148:22.72]Go get the bee hat.
[148:23.72]Okay, I will try to get the bee hat.
[148:41.49]Okay, so I need to become human here.

[149:28.02]In the graveyard, okay.
[149:35.56]Okay, I need to clear this place first, though, of these idiots.
[149:37.96]If I'm going to get invaded right now...
[149:52.12]Lord Which we die to the random skeletons and that being embarrassment, okay.
[150:00.00]Alright, where are you?

[150:54.70]Is that his hat?
[150:58.75]Okay, well, that is a pretty cool hat.
[151:01.71]What does he do?
[151:02.29]He's a magic man.
[151:05.83]Alright, guys, that's like an earthworm.
[151:07.52]That's not a bee.
[151:10.20]He's just aiming a gun at me.
[151:12.16]Put the gun down.
[151:25.24]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[151:27.54]How did that happen?
[151:31.51]I got a ring that protects me against fire damage.
[151:37.71]You Xbox piece of shit controller.
[151:39.49]Oh my god, burn this controller.
[151:41.05]Burn it!

[151:53.34]Because it hit right four times.
[152:04.48]This guy is fucking terrifying, man.
[152:08.49]I'm just playing like hide and go seek with him.
[152:09.95]I don't...
[152:18.65]I could have done it again, but I didn't want to because it wouldn't have enough stamina to do anything.
[152:21.55]Give me that, give me that, give me that, give me that.
[152:23.01]He's not dead.
[152:26.69]Got it.

[152:36.62]Humanity acquired.
[152:38.30]Notched whip.

[152:44.29]You guys promised me an earthworm helmet and it's not here.
[153:06.99]What the heck?
[153:13.84]Look at how many souls I have.

[154:20.45]Come on, Quinn.
[154:23.19]I'm not just going to put like 75 strength in.
[154:40.01]There's a lot of you guys fighting me right now, and I don't like it.
[154:42.61]I don't even want to be locked on.
[154:48.53]What's the point?
[154:56.00]Here they all come.
[155:00.12]Somebody drop something.
[155:00.86]What'd you get?
[155:03.36]A shitty bow.
[155:05.08]Hello.
[155:05.48]Well, I don't even want to fight you.
[155:06.54]Like, because why would I?
[155:08.29]I'm just going to go in the door.
[155:13.62]Did I drop?
[155:14.46]No.
[155:16.44]Alright, boss time.
[155:18.08]Time to fight.
[155:26.69]Traverse the light.
[155:30.77]And it's time.
[155:32.19]He comes in?
[155:32.81]No.
[155:35.95]Where's the, uh... Wait, what?
[155:38.85]Where's the boss bar?
[155:42.20]Where's the health bar?
[155:50.46]What?
[155:51.10]Uh, really?
[155:52.04]Because everybody here sucks.
[156:18.26]Plunge down from the plank and hurry home.
[156:22.64]Wait, she's giving me an out?
[156:26.67]Is she like a cat lady?
[156:28.27]This is weird.
[156:28.85]Alright.
[156:32.99]Can I cut her tail off and run away?
[156:34.43]I don't understand.
[156:39.07]So this is like an optional boss.
[156:41.59]I can just leave.
[156:51.11]Somebody said the hat didn't spawn.
[156:52.57]What do you mean the hat didn't spawn?
[157:00.65]Well, I came all this way.
[157:01.93]No, you know what?
[157:02.57]No, no.
[157:02.97]This thing is a plus five.
[157:04.32]I'm out of here.
[157:07.88]I'm not gonna fight somebody with a weapon that's like an underleveled weapon.
[157:10.28]That would be stupid.
[157:10.96]Alright, can I come back and kill her?
[157:16.76]I can come back and attack her and fight her, right?
[157:30.65]Everyone's fucking freaking out.
[157:37.82]Oh my goodness.
[157:41.02]No balls, words, not... Slay the freak.
[157:45.36]God, quit out.
[157:50.91]Let's... Let's go.
[158:00.87]I'm cutting her tail off.
[158:06.57]It's gonna get in the right spot.
[158:15.70]No, no, no!
[158:19.60]If you attack her, you can't leave until you kill her.
[158:22.30]Well, it looks like I'm gonna have to kill her.
[158:29.27]This is so fucking crazy.
[158:34.65]I'm doing it!
[158:35.51]I expected as much from thee.
[158:38.25]Why dost thee hurry toward thine death?
[158:44.13]Did I beat her?
[158:45.32]Oh, ow.
[158:48.44]Where'd she go?
[158:51.12]She's invisible?
[158:52.36]Wait, why is she invisible?
[158:56.24]How do I make her visible?
[159:07.32]What happened here?
[159:20.29]I can go home still
[159:46.91]Am I stuck here forever until I can kill the invisible boss?
[159:50.80]So I have to kill her while she's invisible?
[160:02.50]No fucking way.
[160:23.11]Punishment for attacking her.
[160:26.50]I really do need to just stop reading chat completely.
[160:30.38]I just need to turn it off.
[160:33.08]Because half of you guys are helpful, the other half of you want to like break the game for me.
[160:39.86]I'm not looking to chat for the rest of the stream.
[160:48.38]Okay.
[160:52.73]Where is she?
[160:57.33]She's dead.
[160:57.73]She fell off the cliff.
[161:00.15]Oh my god, this is bad.
[161:01.75]Okay, you can see her footprints.
[161:04.41]How the fuck are you supposed to kill her?
[161:12.40]She's right here.
[161:13.72]I gotta take the shield off for this one.
[161:20.22]No, I got it.
[161:28.28]Fucking believe in fighting a goddamn invisible lady right now Fuck you guys this is bullshit.
[161:48.42]This is absolute dog shit.
[161:50.34]Oh
[161:59.07]This is unbelievable!
[162:11.06]How could you do this to me?
[162:13.80]How could you do this to me?
[162:27.79]Shit!
[162:44.76]Why?
[162:45.22]This is not fair.
[162:47.31]Where are my moon shoes?
[162:48.41]Alright, I'm doing everything.
[162:50.47]It's alright.
[162:50.81]It's doing fine.
[162:51.33]It's not that big of a deal.
[162:54.99]Just heal.
[162:55.91]She's probably at like 40%.
[162:56.63]Here are the shoes.
[163:12.36]Got it!
[163:12.64]Got it!
[163:12.87]She's alive!
[163:17.37]Okay, I can see her now.
[163:18.25]Thank God.
[163:25.16]No!
[163:26.46]No!
[163:26.78]She just... Why is she easier invisible?
[163:52.50]Ow.
[164:06.08]Where are you?
[164:06.42]Ooh!
[164:06.60]I don't know.
[164:21.30]I'm rolling into her right now.
[164:22.42]Get away.
[164:22.74]I can't believe I'm fighting a boss invisible right now.
[164:30.18]This is so dumb.
[164:33.14]She has to be really close though.
[165:00.16]Come on, stomp over here.
[165:00.94]I win.
[165:06.23]Fuck you.
[165:22.34]Fuck that.
[165:23.50]Fuck this.
[165:24.92]I can go home now, right?
[165:34.23]Where's my hat that you guys all promised me?
[165:37.05]Huh?
[165:37.47]Where's all the spoils of war that I was promised for doing this?
[165:55.73]She told me I could leave this way.
[166:03.71]Oh.
[166:16.58]I hate this.
[166:18.44]I don't want this.
[166:19.14]I'm not putting the giant wooden spoon on my head, guys.
[166:22.48]It blocks my view.
[166:27.36]Do you see how much this blocks the view?
[166:29.03]I'm not using this shit.
[166:31.97]Are you kidding me?
[166:55.51]What do you mean don't laugh?
[166:56.23]It helps.
[166:57.95]It helps enemies run at me in a straight line and have me die.
[167:22.54]Whoa, I'm back here now.
[167:26.67]Alright, well, I have a lot of souls.
[167:27.99]I don't want to lose these.
[167:28.71]I need to go back to Andre, whatever his name is.
[167:38.30]Get it off.
[167:38.90]I... Nope.
[167:52.65]I'm not... Is Bone... Bone's going to take me back to the bonfire.
[167:58.25]If I bone, it's going to take me back to that bonfire, isn't it?
[168:01.77]That's what I would think.
[168:07.07]Oh my fucking god.
[168:08.45]No.
[168:08.69]Dude.
[168:09.73]No.
[168:10.18]What are you doing?
[168:10.98]No.
[168:11.32]I tried to take the item.
[168:13.04]I wanted to take the item.
[168:14.76]I wanted to take his item.
[168:44.34]I'm... I'm... Oh my fucking god.
[168:46.96]How do I get... Can I get out of here for real now?
[168:51.54]Is there a way I could... Can I get the fuck out of here for real?
[168:53.93]No, like, joking around.
[168:54.87]No debates.
[168:55.89]Can I just get out of here?
[168:58.67]If I bone... It's gonna take me back to here.
[169:05.19]Why would the bone not... The bone's gonna bring me right here.
[169:12.91]What are you guys talking about?
[169:13.99]Stop.
[169:26.87]I have to go run and touch it again.
[169:28.58]I'm fine.
[169:29.32]Just wait a minute.
[169:31.30]I knew it.
[169:31.94]I don't even know what... I was supposed to look at chat ever again.
[169:37.42]Just let me level up.
[169:38.36]Ay-yi-yi.
[169:40.40]40 strength.
[169:42.78]Done deal.
[169:49.27]Just go walk off the bridge again.
[170:15.24]Watch out for the respawns.
[170:16.46]I'm going to be alright.
[170:17.30]She's not... It's a boss.
[170:18.12]She doesn't respawn.
[170:25.75]Watch her respawn.
[170:28.39]Yeah, I don't have the Lord Vessel.
[170:29.57]I can't respawn.
[170:30.37]I can't not respawn.
[170:31.87]Why are you in that spot?
[170:34.03]I don't... I just want to get around you.
[170:35.33]I don't care about fighting you.
[170:36.63]Please do not make me do this again.
[170:38.71]Please do not make me do it again.
[170:40.31]Don't make me do it again.
[170:42.67]Oh my god, they're gonna make me do it again.
[170:43.67]They're gonna make me do it again.
[170:44.57]They're gonna make me do it again.
[170:45.45]They are.
[170:45.83]Look at them.
[170:46.97]Look at them.
[170:47.27]They're trying to make me do it again.
[170:48.07]They're gonna get me to do it again.
[170:51.85]Off the cliff.
[170:52.45]Come on.
[170:56.65]He's right behind me.
[171:01.19]Okay, we're fine.
[171:07.15]I know you won't believe this, but using the bone outside would have taken you to Anolando.
[171:17.05]I skipped it, don't worry.
[171:18.41]Look at how much health I have.
[171:19.49]Oh, fuck.
[171:21.69]Okay.
[171:24.03]What the hell was I doing here?
[171:26.73]I don't even remember.
[171:28.09]It's been so long.
[171:34.47]No, I'm not going to use the bone now.
[171:36.03]I don't need to.
[171:38.81]I didn't get done exploring this area.
[171:40.95]There might be a place to go or a place to walk.
[171:44.76]I didn't... I can't... Somebody said, look at the painting, and I clicked it.
[171:47.47]I want to see if anything else is down here.
[171:50.89]Let's go back in the painting.
[171:54.25]Is that, like, staircase?
[171:55.27]Hold on.
[171:55.67]Just give me a minute.
[172:04.26]Yeah.
[172:06.02]Hey, maybe the painting will work.
[172:11.62]Nothing else here, huh?
[172:19.11]It's out here.
[172:19.71]Hold on.
[172:20.11]Just wait.
[172:21.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[172:22.02]You like that, Dodge?
[172:26.44]Look, it's all good.
[172:27.94]Everything's fine.
[172:28.68]That's what I knew.
[172:29.26]That's what was down there.
[172:31.16]Now we go up here.
[172:37.51]The doll from the tutorial was opening the painting.
[172:39.57]Oh, that's cool.
[172:42.45]That's cool.
[172:42.83]I like it.
[172:43.83]I'm into it.
[172:49.06]Look at the painting and you get a cool bee hat.
[172:52.78]Alright, so.
[172:54.64]Now, we've got two places to go here.
[172:57.32]I need... Where's my bonfire?
[173:09.93]From all that time ago.
[173:17.41]Bonfire is down, isn't it?
[173:28.21]Wait, did I miss it then?
[173:37.59]Oh, right, right, right.
[173:38.25]Okay.
[173:39.75]No, I don't know.
[173:40.77]I'm stupid.
[173:41.51]I have no idea where it is.
[173:42.63]Because I turned this and I came down.
[173:48.04]This is just like an hour and a half ago.
[173:57.28]Nope.
[174:03.00]Oh, the stairs need to be moved, right?
[174:05.49]Okay.
[174:13.85]Why am I not wearing pants?
[174:16.57]I mean, because I'm doing... I was being a bee for a while, and it was laugh-out-loud fucking funny, wasn't it?
[174:23.40]But now I feel like I'm ruining the character.
[174:33.84]Down we go.
[174:36.84]Wait, there's probably something I can do with this.
[174:38.82]Like jump off at the right time and there's an item.
[174:44.30]That's what I would think.
[174:44.94]Alright, now we're back here.
[174:50.46]And then... Is it down now?
[174:52.88]I don't... Just let me explore.
[174:54.68]Let me make the mistake so I don't make it again.
[174:58.08]Let me make this mistake.
[175:01.00]Okay, there it is.
[175:13.30]New Bonfire.
[175:14.24]There it is.
[175:22.11]Ring of Suns Firstborn.
[175:25.93]What is that?
[175:26.61]Let's see.
[175:29.25]Fire Defense.
[175:30.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[175:31.89]Boost Miracles.
[175:32.83]Don't have any.
[175:38.25]I really kind of want to put this one on, but... You know.
[175:44.03]Alright, you get to have this on for, like, the next 30 minutes, and then it comes off.
[175:47.87]Alright, rest.
[175:51.25]I don't think I need to kindle this.
[176:02.49]Hit the statue.
[176:03.21]I just did.
[176:06.35]I'm hitting the statue.
[176:07.07]Nothing's happening.
[176:11.11]What, does the statue come alive and fight me?
[176:14.44]Not on this planet.
[176:19.08]Yeah, use the dirty Q-tip that was already in somebody's ear.
[176:29.24]Hit it for an hour.
[176:32.85]What are you guys talking about?
[176:39.37]Okay, so this thing can be moved.
[176:40.41]So now if I go... I really need to go back to the blacksmith.
[176:45.80]Yeah, I'm making the trek back to Blacksmith and we're upgrading the weapons.
[176:50.53]I ain't running around with these shit items anymore.
[176:53.27]So now I need to pull it and go... How the fuck do I get out of here?
[177:09.12]I gotta think about how to get out of this place.
[177:19.96]I don't think I've gone over.
[177:20.86]Have I gone over here?
[177:21.80]I think this is... Yeah, this is the way to go.
[177:29.34]That spiral thing in the middle.
[177:31.22]Yeah, this is where I went before.
[177:32.26]This is where I came from.
[177:37.16]Is that the thing that goes up and down?
[177:39.72]Right?
[177:44.64]Or is it?
[177:45.63]Is this the place to go in the...
[177:51.83]I don't think it is.
[177:52.55]Is it?
[177:52.77]No, this goes... No, this goes... Is this, is this, is this, is this, is this?
[177:59.33]No, I know.
[177:59.91]Okay, so this is the other way.
[178:13.05]Back out of this to climb up again?
[178:19.00]Wait, I was right.
[178:24.09]Because I had to pull the lever to go down.
[178:29.31]I'm so confused at what's happening.
[178:30.59]Me too.
[178:30.91]Because I want to go back to the black.
[178:33.52]There's two ways to go here.
[178:34.78]I can keep going this way.
[178:37.82]I'm just lost.
[178:38.44]Dude, what is straight ahead here?
[178:48.25]I'm going this way.
[178:49.05]I haven't gone this way yet, so I'm going to go this way.
[178:53.68]We might not just even look.
[178:54.54]Because I'd have to go all the way back to... Okay, this is... Yeah, I have not been this way yet.
[179:09.20]Bonfire's back there.
[179:10.16]These guys attack?
[179:13.44]I feel like they do.
[179:21.81]Two of these idiots.
[179:28.70]What's the durability on this right now?
[179:29.86]85 out of 400, okay.
[179:38.38]This thing is tiny in comparison to my head.
[179:40.46]Oh my god.
[179:55.72]I don't like the bee head.
[179:56.94]It's too big.
[179:58.34]It's causing too many problems.
[180:00.86]Well, that's a shortcut.
[180:08.49]I'm going to go over here.
[180:14.63]Why don't you ever want to wear this thing?
[180:21.70]I'm dead.
[180:23.06]I'm so dead.
[180:25.94]I need to just run.
[180:27.72]But where to?
[180:28.46]That's the question.
[180:30.82]What about over here?
[180:31.42]Oh, this is a way to get one of those items.
[180:34.44]And these weird brain frogs.
[180:37.52]They're still right behind me, isn't he?
[180:39.32]He's right behind me.
[180:44.72]I keep thinking the weapon is my head.
[180:50.63]How did that not hit you?
[180:51.89]I'll never understand.
[180:52.73]Alright, so I'm safe.
[181:04.62]That didn't hit him.
[181:10.14]Just barely.
[181:10.86]That sucks.
[181:11.63]Just barely not enough damage to kill him in two hits.
[181:15.07]Demon spear.
[181:18.43]Way down there.
[181:19.01]I have to take this thing off.
[181:32.19]It's sincerely getting in my way.
[181:35.73]It's hurting my video game.
[181:38.11]It's causing me problems.
[181:39.83]I'll wear it to like laugh at a boss fight or something one day.
[181:42.51]Come here.
[181:50.99]What about that way?
[181:53.11]Illusion?
[181:55.33]No.
[181:58.87]This has to have a point, right?
[182:00.03]Maybe not.
[182:04.20]That one, I guess the other one over here.
[182:14.85]So it's too huge.
[182:21.83]My character looks like a bell.
[182:23.23]Yeah, he does.
[182:33.03]This is bad.
[182:33.51]This is very bad.
[182:36.35]And that, a spike just went right into my face.
[182:39.57]Oh man, this is not good.
[182:43.06]Where the fuck am I supposed to go from here?
[182:47.32]Oh my god, you two are fucking relentless.
[182:52.12]Can I just get even like a fucking second to even see where the hell I am?
[183:00.01]What?
[183:01.07]What is happening right now?
[183:06.13]Is there any point to that?
[183:12.65]That could go down there?
[183:13.79]Hey!
[183:15.89]Hey!
[183:17.01]You can't curve arrows!
[183:18.21]I need- I'm gonna die.
[183:30.13]I was trying to roll.
[183:33.43]I can't even stand still.
[183:34.33]They're just swinging every fucking... I can't... What am I supposed to do down there?
[183:38.02]I have to kill them, but I have no fucking healing.
[183:39.82]I need to kindle this bonfire.
[183:43.90]And I... I need more than... I need to go back to the blacksmith is what I need to do.
[183:55.85]Because this is bad.
[184:24.02]There's a new smith here?
[184:24.86]Yeah, but I have to get to him.
[184:37.95]You know, I still have to get there.
[184:42.89]I'm using a plus one right here, and then I have a plus five.
[184:45.95]I need to get this to, like, plus four.
[184:50.82]Honestly, I need to just not use it.
[184:52.54]What is this?
[184:53.00]Let's see.
[184:53.34]These new items.
[184:56.34]This is a lightning spear.
[184:58.12]No scaling.
[184:58.86]That's cool.
[185:07.16]Demon spear.
[185:08.42]That's not bad.
[185:10.09]That's pretty good scaling.
[185:17.21]D... D...
[185:20.81]That's another whip.
[185:21.51]Notched whip.
[185:23.11]V scaling.
[185:23.95]Cool.
[185:28.38]Let me just check.
[185:28.82]I want to see what it does.
[185:30.18]Lightning spear.
[185:35.52]It's just like a standard spear.
[185:36.74]I'm sure it makes electricity noises when you stab somebody.
[185:42.58]What about the demon spear?
[185:43.92]Ooh, this thing's cool.
[185:46.29]That's a lot of reach.
[185:52.98]Wow, that's actually pretty cool.
[185:55.79]Oh yeah, there's the bee stinger.
[186:04.99]What is the scaling on this?
[186:05.87]This thing is actually pretty cool.
[186:08.09]CC.
[186:09.79]Carved from the bones of fellow demons, wielded by the slim, lesser batwing demons.
[186:14.11]The weapon of these chaos demons wandering on Orlando are different from those of the chaos demons that are imbued with lightning.
[186:19.81]Yeah.
[186:23.91]Let's go back to Butcher for now, because it's the only thing I have upgraded.
[186:27.11]Alright, let's try this again.
[186:37.71]So this is out here.
[186:39.23]I need to pull this again.
[186:57.52]Let's go!
[187:07.18]135 plus 112.
[187:11.96]This is 144 and 144.
[187:16.56]So this is actually more damage right now.
[187:19.56]The lightning spear is actually better.
[187:25.19]Can I wear it?
[187:25.65]Can I put it on?
[187:29.31]This thing's actually better.
[187:32.84]Just straight up number wise, right?
[187:39.10]This is even better.
[187:45.53]There's no scaling on it, but I'm just temporarily just to use now because this is not as good.
[188:00.08]Let me try it.
[188:01.94]Let's give it a go.
[188:06.34]Split damage, yeah.
[188:07.94]I just want to see.
[188:12.35]R2 on the Demon Spirit knocks down people.
[188:17.51]We'll have to give it a try.
[188:25.78]I am a beast.
[188:26.34]It is a beast thing, though.
[188:37.10]This way.
[188:44.62]I'm still in Anor Lando?
[188:45.62]Well, I just did the whole painting world instead of finishing this.
[188:49.40]I'm not sure if you missed that part.
[188:52.14]You may have.
[188:55.63]I went in the painting.
[189:00.19]You're too calm for this to be a Dark Souls game?
[189:04.87]I mean, that might be true.
[189:11.29]How much damage is this even going to do to these guys?
[189:13.75]No, don't pull your friend.
[189:15.01]I just want you.
[189:15.87]Just you.
[189:18.68]Take this slow.
[189:25.80]Oh, that's not doing very much damage.
[189:27.04]I mean, it makes a cool sound.
[189:33.80]These guys... It does not do much damage to these guys.
[189:41.24]Thanks for the boost.
[189:51.07]It is very fast.
[189:54.71]I don't hate it.
[189:55.29]I think it's cool.
[189:56.17]I like it.
[190:07.63]Swing again.
[190:11.77]Alright, no more back jumping.
[190:14.71]I know, it's cool, you can do it.
[190:25.59]Actual B. We did get there.
[190:32.89]Why is this easier for me to use than the other thing I was just using?
[190:37.84]Giant's Halberd.
[190:41.41]Hold on now.
[190:42.07]Wait just a second here.
[190:45.84]140.
[190:50.48]Traces of lightning.
[190:52.56]So this is also lightning.
[190:53.60]36.
[190:56.90]I had 12.
[190:58.44]God damn it.
[191:02.82]I could put the crystal halberd.
[191:03.92]No, I can't.
[191:04.68]12.
[191:05.30]No dex.
[191:05.94]Shit.
[191:07.28]That's unfortunate.
[191:11.40]Um, what about this one?
[191:12.72]This one actually is more damage because of the scaling, right?
[191:15.33]No, what's the math there?
[191:16.69]154, 120, 144, 144.
[191:18.15]It's like the same thing, isn't it?
[191:25.57]No, this one's a little worse.
[191:28.09]Yeah.
[191:32.65]Alright, now that I can actually look around here, let's see if I can do anything else.
[191:36.07]This is all locked.
[191:36.85]This is a shortcut here as well, right there.
[191:41.04]That can't open.
[191:46.28]Two-hand the halberd?
[191:47.03]I thought I needed dex for that.
[191:53.33]Don't you need to have that dex to even be able to put the item on?
[191:56.43]Alright, if I was an illusion wall, I would be right there.
[192:06.14]I would.
[192:06.82]I would be right next to that.
[192:10.24]If I'm a game designer, I put it right here.
[192:13.68]Well, looks like I won't be designing any games anytime soon.
[192:25.43]No, I'm not still here.
[192:27.89]Everybody that comes in and goes, why are you still here?
[192:30.47]What the fuck are you still doing here?
[192:31.75]I did a whole nother world.
[192:34.89]I did the painted world of Hariando.
[192:37.53]That took like two hours.
[192:46.35]I haven't just been stuck in Anor Lando for like five hours.
[192:50.37]What is that?
[192:50.71]Come here.
[192:53.23]Come on.
[192:53.61]One at a time.
[192:58.00]Fuck this guy.
[192:59.14]He sucks.
[193:02.38]God damn it.
[193:03.68]I hate these guys.
[193:04.46]They're just so erratic and their fucking bodies are all over the place.
[193:13.27]They're just such huge sloppy bodies and they have long ass spears.
[193:17.66]Jeremy, shut the fuck up.
[193:19.40]And play the game.
[193:20.20]Before you're grounded.
[193:22.40]Oh my god, I can't even hurt these guys.
[193:27.97]I just did 45 damage to that dude.
[193:29.39]These guys are lightning too.
[193:31.57]This is bad.
[193:37.15]I need to put the demon spear on.
[193:44.54]I'm so fucked right now.
[193:45.68]I need my weapon.
[193:46.52]I need to use a weapon that I actually want to upgrade.
[193:53.75]Okay, I can use it.
[194:02.78]Oh, fucking god.
[194:04.58]This is a nightmare.
[194:20.66]Fuck this place.
[194:22.24]This place sucks.
[194:35.45]I have to just go back to the thing I know what I'm doing with.
[194:38.24]Even if it's not leveled up.
[194:41.28]Yeah.
[195:04.36]What's going on here?
[195:05.76]What am I doing?
[195:07.30]I'm so angry right now that I even forgot.
[195:09.47]I need to press the button.
[195:28.50]I'm just gonna hold my shield out.
[195:30.46]And block everything.
[195:31.58]In fact, do I have a lightning shield?
[195:33.32]I probably do.
[195:35.72]Lightning.
[195:36.08]Where is it?
[195:36.80]Eagle shield.
[195:37.48]75 for the eagle shield.
[195:48.39]I'm just gonna hold the fucking eagle shield out.
[195:50.37]And just walk.
[196:08.97]There is no fast traveling in Dark Souls 1 until you get a specific item, which I do not have.
[196:30.72]I thought you were going to do a move.
[196:31.50]Apparently not.
[196:36.78]Oh, these are my least two favorite enemies in the whole game.
[196:41.01]These guys and the brain monkeys are the two worst enemies.
[196:43.85]I can't fight them.
[196:44.99]I hate them.
[196:45.37]I don't know why.
[196:49.69]Something about them.
[197:01.19]Look at how easy these guys are.
[197:03.87]It just causes me so much pain.
[197:08.84]Okay.
[197:09.72]It's time to cheese the shit out of this stupid enemy.
[197:13.40]Fuck you.
[197:13.62]You guys suck.
[197:43.01]Yeah, when you can fight one, it's not that bad.
[197:44.89]When you have to fight two or three at the same time.
[197:52.78]Look, there's one right here.
[197:53.60]I bet you didn't see him.
[197:54.36]Yeah, you can fly.
[198:11.74]Not using your wings, though, are you?
[198:23.56]Fuck you.
[198:25.66]My rage holds no bounds against these dudes right now.
[198:29.90]Alright, so we got over there.
[198:36.77]He's still on Anuleto.
[198:38.91]Wow, he's still here?
[198:40.49]Stop it.
[198:41.51]Cut it out.
[198:43.99]Don't be so mean to me.
[198:51.38]God, what am I thinking here?
[198:54.16]It's not don't fight.
[198:55.36]It's impossible to fight them here.
[198:59.84]And when you go over there, you have to stand in the middle while they both fucking throw a bunch of shit at you.
[199:14.07]Just do the pancake part.
[199:16.66]And here he comes.
[199:20.22]Get over here.
[199:23.19]Get over here.
[199:24.83]Stop this.
[199:25.71]Get your sword out and fight me like a man.
[199:29.55]Not both of you, though.
[199:30.37]Not both of you.
[199:31.42]Only one of you was supposed to do that.
[199:33.56]Fall.
[199:34.88]Fall, I command it.
[199:51.68]Thank God.
[199:52.18]Okay.
[199:52.64]Jesus.
[199:58.87]How are we doing?
[199:59.97]Where are we at now?
[200:09.79]I hate this place.
[200:11.92]You know what?
[200:12.38]I think I hated this place in Dark Souls 3 as well.
[200:18.70]Oh my goodness.
[200:27.65]Stop.
[200:28.55]It just sounds like a basketball is hitting me.
[200:39.09]Okay, we're safe.
[200:45.59]Oh, no.
[200:46.45]Not this bullshit.
[200:51.17]Oh, no.
[200:52.95]Oh, no.
[200:53.37]Wait, I gotta get a look at the other side.
[200:54.75]Where am I going from here?
[201:08.86]Oh, through the glass.
[201:10.70]Damn it!
[201:12.06]Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[201:14.46]Damn it.
[201:16.26]Oh, damn it.
[201:16.78]Oh, damn.
[201:17.42]Oh, damn.
[201:23.94]Oh, damn it.
[201:24.68]Oh, damn it.
[201:32.33]Oh, my fucking God.
[201:33.67]I'm trying...
[201:35.45]Holy shit, how unbearable.
[201:37.35]How un-fucking-bearable.
[201:44.77]Wow.
[201:46.55]I just needed to- I was trying to parry him, but every time I would put this to parry, I would get shot by a fucking arrow.
[201:53.12]Wait, I can't parry with this shield?! !
[202:11.12]This is like, no wonder!
[202:12.28]I'm like, why?
[202:12.82]What's happening to me?
[202:17.18]It's a great shield, but I'm a great man!
[202:19.22]Don't you understand?
[202:19.88]I'm a, I'm a 39, I'm a 40 strength man!
[202:23.97]You tellin' me a 40 strength man can't parry with this shield?
[202:31.79]Alright, I'm, I'm gonna get through this shit.
[202:35.65]Now I know that's there, and that, there's an item over there, but I'm, I'm, I gotta go the other way first.
[202:41.87]Oh, man.
[202:48.92]Why is he still here?
[202:57.97]I love these games.
[202:59.65]I love Dark Souls.
[203:00.49]I love Bloodborne.
[203:01.27]Bloodborne is one of my favorite games ever made in the history of video games.
[203:05.25]But God damn it, man.
[203:07.77]Does this company just sometimes try to find ways
[203:11.52]What's the most frustrating thing we could ever do in this situation?
[203:15.02]Do it.
[203:17.22]It happens in like once or twice in every game.
[203:19.57]There's that one place that just sucks absolute asshole.
[203:23.51]The whole time.
[203:29.27]They don't do it through the whole game.
[203:30.49]They put it in like one or two spots through the whole experience.
[203:54.54]Oh, fuck Anor Londo.
[203:55.78]It's time for a break?
[204:04.26]No, I'm fine.
[204:05.02]I'm fine!
[204:06.10]I'm fine.
[204:11.20]I must need the bee hat.
[204:19.07]Is this the new thing?
[204:20.47]Is this like the new meme?
[204:22.97]Are you gonna meme me here with a new one with the, I just got back?
[204:26.38]Well, he's still fucking at it, Orlando.
[204:29.28]You want me to look over there and be like, ah!
[204:42.77]Go inspect the painting.
[204:50.54]Look, if it just didn't take so long to do this part... Can't you just like have the bonfire like sitting in the middle inside of this stupid machine?
[205:19.27]Go to the graveyard as a human.
[205:20.73]I already did that.
[205:22.91]I killed that guy.
[205:30.77]I just have to do this.
[205:32.57]I just can't.
[205:33.55]You have to just kill everything here.
[205:35.25]Maybe not these.
[205:39.82]No, I don't.
[205:40.86]No, I don't.
[205:41.48]It's time to be a goddamn man, okay?
[205:48.82]It's time to man up.
[205:50.19]It's time to put on my pants, heal, and get to the top of the fucking tower in one run.
[205:55.96]Are you ready?
[205:56.40]Begin.
[205:57.80]Begin.
[206:27.79]Lightning bolt to me!
[206:28.49]Alright, I'm good.
[206:43.00]This shield can't parry.
[206:43.86]This shield can't parry.
[206:44.86]This shield can't parry.
[206:46.78]Say it a million times, maybe it'll work.
[206:49.67]Oh boy, bouncing around like a beach ball!
[206:57.30]Oh, we fuck you in my... I did it.
[207:03.96]I did it.
[207:04.42]I did it.
[207:04.72]I did it.
[207:05.06]I did it.
[207:05.34]I did it.
[207:05.62]I did it.
[207:05.98]I did it.
[207:07.18]I did it.
[207:11.96]Okay.
[207:14.34]There's a place to go in there.
[207:25.81]What's this?
[207:27.69]What's this?
[207:30.30]What's this?
[207:31.02]What's this?
[207:35.78]Bonfire.
[207:37.38]Special bonfire.
[207:40.88]And guess what?
[207:41.46]Here's a special bonfire just for you.
[207:46.77]There's a Black Knight in here.
[207:57.01]What's in this one?
[208:05.11]And there's our friend.
[208:21.92]What a game.
[208:25.94]What does he have to say?
[208:28.72]Oh, there you are.
[208:30.38]Smooth summoning out there.
[208:32.16]Anytime you see my brilliantly shining signature, do not hesitate to call upon me.
[208:37.33]You've left me with quite an impression.
[208:39.53]I would relish a chance to assist you.
[208:43.95]So Lara's here, which means he did all that on his own without help.
[208:46.85]I didn't get help.
[208:48.96]Who helped me?
[208:51.58]I'm wearing a fucking inflated Michelin Man costume.
[208:53.94]You think that's help?
[209:05.69]Chat didn't help.
[209:11.39]Yeah, this is the same chat that told me to do a bunch of weird fucked up shit and screwed up my character.
[209:19.93]He's good.
[209:21.61]Alright, I'm going to take a piss.
[209:28.21]Give me a moment.
[209:29.56]Take a quick break.
[209:30.38]I'm coming back.
[209:35.02]Take care.
[209:35.66]See you in two minutes.
[209:37.31]Time to pee.
[209:37.89]Grab a drink.
[209:38.96]See you in a sec.
[212:38.66]Hey, what's up?
[212:39.85]We're back.
[212:40.35]That's a good water.
[212:58.62]This over here.
[213:01.79]Hey, remember this video game that you've seen before?
[213:06.21]Your chance to make that joke is at the painting.
[213:07.67]Just pretend I did.
[213:11.15]Alright, let's go back to my green crest.
[213:14.97]Please, Xbox One.
[213:17.69]I hate you.
[213:20.47]So is that all he can do?
[213:21.71]I guess so.
[213:23.17]I should probably kindle this bonfire, I would assume.
[213:29.17]I'm using a lot of humanity here.
[213:30.39]I need two, right?
[213:35.29]Twin humanities!
[213:40.42]Gain two humanity.
[213:43.34]Take one.
[213:52.14]Xbox, please.
[213:57.64]Do a triple humanity?
[213:59.68]I don't need to do a triple humanity.
[214:02.60]Why are you doing that?
[214:05.12]Seriously, that's going to do something terrible to me one day here.
[214:11.73]Alright.
[214:17.03]So.
[214:19.25]That looks good.
[214:19.81]We've got a bonfire in here now.
[214:21.22]Now I'm going to go fight the Black Knight and not get hit one time.
[214:28.94]Alright, let's see.
[214:29.88]Don't get hit once.
[214:31.12]Literally one time will not happen.
[214:33.10]Guaranteed.
[214:44.87]What'd I tell you?
[214:46.35]He didn't even fucking come close, dude.
[215:00.35]No Black Knight armor.
[215:02.95]Three sunlight metals.
[215:04.25]Cool.
[215:05.91]Whatever that does.
[215:12.15]I like the inside of this place.
[215:15.52]I like the way it looks inside.
[215:16.74]Okay, now... I would like... To go backwards a little bit here.
[215:22.42]I want to go back.
[215:23.88]Because there's an item out there...
[215:27.08]There's a couple things I've ran right by because I was terrified, but I want to see if I can... Wait, is that even possible anymore?
[215:33.70]Because I jumped down, right?
[215:37.40]No, never mind.
[215:37.92]I can't even do it.
[215:38.84]No.
[215:39.18]Well, let's just go in this way.
[215:44.53]Fucking dumb game.
[215:48.23]I can't even go back?
[215:50.77]What, like a fucking 9.5 out of 10?
[216:03.14]Ooh, that didn't kill you, which I thought it was going to.
[216:05.74]Okay, now I'm... Okay, I'm seriously... Like, this is why I need this to be upgraded.
[216:14.33]This is why this thing can't be plus five.
[216:16.86]Because that guy just should be dead.
[216:18.80]Like, honest to God, I'm using such a gimped fucking shit weapon right now.
[216:21.90]It's unbelievable.
[216:34.28]Nobody in here?
[216:35.58]Body parts?
[216:41.54]Nothing It's just fun to do that, you know?
[216:54.03]A poor craftsman blames his tools.
[216:56.39]Yeah, you know, you're allowed to blame... Okay.
[216:58.79]If I was building a staircase, and I'm a major, number one, best craftsman in the world, and you hand me a rusty hammer that you duct tape the top onto, and if I hit too hard on the nail, the head falls off.
[217:12.83]Is that really blaming the craftsman?
[217:14.93]Or is that blaming the shitty tool he has to use?
[217:19.12]You could be number one craftsman in the world and, hey, screw this screw in with your hand.
[217:23.63]You don't get a drill.
[217:25.27]That's impossible.
[217:29.49]You're only as strong as your weakest tool.
[217:39.20]And yes, the number one craftsman in the world may have forgotten his tool bag.
[217:44.78]But that's why he has to go back and get it.
[217:48.78]You could be the best at something.
[217:49.86]You could be number one.
[217:51.05]But, you know, you forgot your tool somewhere.
[218:03.50]He's alive.
[218:04.20]He's alive.
[218:04.68]He's alive.
[218:05.28]I can see it.
[218:29.67]Damn it.
[218:30.49]He didn't get me.
[218:31.01]Thank God And it is silver coin Is there more than one mimic in here
[218:50.61]This is a mimic too, isn't it?
[218:52.99]Yeah, it is.
[218:53.89]God damn, man.
[219:05.10]Really?
[219:05.38]You back swung me?
[219:06.52]You hit the catcher with the bat?
[219:07.62]Fuck you.
[219:22.17]Wow, I thought I missed.
[219:23.17]Good thing that's a gigantic zone there.
[219:29.49]Gold coin.
[219:31.79]I guess I don't understand what the deal with these are.
[219:41.46]Is that alive?
[219:43.54]That thing's going to turn and be like... It's going to start talking to me or something.
[219:46.18]It's going to shoot fire out of its mouth.
[219:48.74]That thing is elaborate looking.
[219:49.88]Why wouldn't it?
[219:57.51]Look at that thing.
[219:58.07]Come on.
[219:58.29]That thing's going to turn into... Look at me.
[220:00.53]I know it is.
[220:01.07]It's so menacing looking.
[220:07.98]All of a sudden, the thing starts to sing.
[220:09.26]Yeah, the big mouth bass.
[220:20.09]Hello there.
[220:35.02]I wish I could kind of move out of the way here.
[220:41.50]Come on, get him out of the way.
[220:56.02]This is awkward.
[221:03.48]What a shitty fight.
[221:11.24]I just wish I could see anything, man.
[221:13.22]Come on.
[221:30.66]I...
[221:36.93]This is so dumb.
[221:40.82]I just slammed the whole bottle.
[221:42.12]Alright, get out of my fucking way!
[221:44.93]Get out of here!
[222:05.51]There he goes again, like, screaming.
[222:07.31]There he goes.
[222:16.72]There goes Jerma985 again, fucking screaming.
[222:19.02]Somebody in the bed?
[222:35.62]Huh?
[222:36.02]Who's that?
[222:37.42]Who is it?
[222:37.76]I'm confused.
[222:42.56]See what I'm talking about?
[223:04.24]With an upgraded weapon, he's dead.
[223:08.24]I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.
[223:19.41]What about the bed?
[223:20.01]Illusionary bed.
[223:23.51]I don't know if that means anything.
[223:24.99]I hear somebody walking around.
[223:44.01]How many are there?
[223:46.48]Is it just the one guy here?
[223:48.74]No, it's two.
[223:54.75]Really need to hug the wall here and fight the guy with the bow and arrow.
[223:58.00]Do they all have bows?
[224:24.25]Okay.
[224:24.57]We can go down there.
[224:31.10]There's another guy over here, though.
[224:32.06]I want to clear him out.
[224:40.90]I didn't block that?
[224:43.45]I thought I did.
[224:54.39]Weird audio.
[224:55.07]What do you mean, weird audio?
[225:02.56]We've got weird audio here?
[225:03.90]Ooh!
[225:09.50]It's my friend!
[225:11.54]I'm so glad to see him.
[225:13.46]What are you trying to get out the window?
[225:21.49]Do you see that I'm wearing the same thing as you?
[225:26.34]We could be in the same club.
[225:42.20]There's this weird voice talking over the game.
[225:49.95]It's really annoying.
[225:50.77]I don't know what it is.
[225:51.39]Okay, well, I don't know what that means, buddy.
[226:06.84]In the name of God, you've got... Sigward!
[226:09.18]Squidward!
[226:10.30]Squidward!
[226:15.15]We're not going that way.
[226:20.07]Oh, shit.
[226:21.37]Oh, shit.
[226:23.19]Oh, shit.
[226:24.05]He's in hot pursuit.
[226:25.35]Shit.
[226:26.73]Oh, my God.
[226:27.21]Just go.
[226:27.67]Run.
[226:28.03]Run from him.
[226:36.43]Oh man, oh man, he's behind me.
[226:39.03]Is he behind me?
[226:40.19]Is there a guy in here?
[226:43.87]He's still there!
[226:44.41]Fuck you.
[227:10.09]I can't go in here.
[227:10.79]I can't go in here.
[227:15.23]Guys, I can't go in here.
[227:46.46]He's got a spear.
[227:50.97]The bane of my whole video game existence.
[227:54.11]I'm going to try to get around him.
[228:01.22]Let's pull him out.
[228:02.82]I can't fuck around right now.
[228:03.72]I need to find another place to go.
[228:04.74]Come on up.
[228:13.46]That went through.
[228:15.15]Somehow.
[228:16.99]Okay.
[228:17.81]Oh, I'm just spinning around in a goddamn fucking circle.
[228:21.47]Stop the lock-on.
[228:22.63]Stop the lock-on nonsense.
[228:27.55]Enough with the lock-on.
[228:29.61]Oh, no.
[228:30.61]Open this door.
[228:36.84]Where did I end up?
[228:38.48]I don't know.
[228:38.82]First floor?
[228:40.36]Isn't the bonfire somewhere around here?
[228:42.82]Somebody said fireplace.
[228:44.37]Got it.
[228:44.73]Fireplace.
[228:45.19]Fireplace.
[228:45.63]Got it.
[228:52.39]What's down here?
[229:01.24]I hear somebody walking.
[229:02.04]I hear somebody walking.
[229:02.94]This chest is everywhere.
[229:07.86]I'm leaning into my screen right now.
[229:12.26]Okay, hold on.
[229:16.52]This is not a Mimic.
[229:20.68]I got the Havel set now.
[229:25.08]All of it, apparently.
[229:35.27]Dragon Tooth.
[229:37.33]This is a Mimic.
[229:39.45]Let's check everything else.
[229:44.39]Okay, let's see if I can kill this guy without dying here.
[229:48.83]It would be so bad if I died.
[229:49.89]I gotta make this count.
[230:10.25]Can't backstab mimics?
[230:12.03]That's dumb.
[230:26.87]Okay, we're good.
[230:33.65]A cult club.
[230:34.43]We've got some new weapons here now.
[230:38.95]His back's too high.
[230:39.85]Oh, you can just go like this.
[230:41.67]I can reach up there and slash.
[230:43.09]Alright, anything else in here?
[230:46.57]Or is it just those chests?
[230:51.96]Looks like that's it.
[230:57.46]Now, I opened up the door that led back up there, so... Let me see if... Where's the bonfire from here?
[231:06.47]Isn't it, like, right around the corner here?
[231:09.09]Because then I opened up this door.
[231:12.95]This is the shortcut here.
[231:15.66]So then... Fireplace is back here.
[231:21.26]Yeah.
[231:27.00]No, other one.
[231:29.72]Alright.
[231:30.64]Nice.
[231:30.80]I'm glad I got that escape there.
[231:36.61]It's time to crush some stuff.
[231:42.65]So, I don't think I'm going to use these.
[231:44.95]Priscilla, Iron Golem.
[231:46.51]I mean, I feel like maybe there's something cool there.
[231:47.92]Let's take a look at the new stuff, though.
[231:53.92]Dragon Tooth.
[231:58.50]290 plus 86.
[231:59.67]D scaling.
[232:03.69]What else did I get here?
[232:04.55]The giants thing, yeah.
[232:07.31]Occult club was another one.
[232:10.83]Here's the balder side sword that everyone told me was decent.
[232:15.05]I guess if you're dexterity.
[232:20.32]Great sword.
[232:23.28]Painting guardian sword.
[232:24.18]That's A scaling base.
[232:25.42]That's pretty great.
[232:30.39]Put your knife five.
[232:33.47]Occult Club.
[232:34.23]D and A. This thing scales with... Is that Faith?
[232:40.35]No, that's Faith, right?
[232:43.73]That's pretty cool.
[232:50.18]Iron Golem Soul is used for a Golem Axe.
[232:56.34]The Priscilla thing, I'm going to crush Priscilla.
[233:01.66]I'm not gonna use the thing that she has, I don't think.
[233:05.60]No.
[233:06.24]It's like a dex weapon.
[233:10.62]Let me just check out this tooth.
[233:17.87]It's just a big, sloppy... I already have one of these.
[233:21.03]I look insane.
[233:32.66]Alright, we got other things.
[233:33.76]Here's Havel, whatever.
[233:35.58]Well, that's a huge poise increase.
[233:41.94]Right, I mean, where's the rest of it?
[233:43.40]47 poise.
[233:47.07]God damn.
[233:50.39]I think I'm gonna have to be, uh... Let's just see with it all on.
[233:58.53]What's my poise at right now?
[233:59.57]71 out of 100.
[234:08.32]No, I can't use it.
[234:09.20]Alright, I look like one of the Muppets.
[234:16.93]Alright, this is like Havel's sleepover party.
[234:23.01]I'm ready for my sleepover.
[234:24.55]All my friends are here.
[234:25.59]Solaire.
[234:27.99]Sigward.
[234:29.13]I can't wait.
[234:29.53]We're going to watch TV until at least 10 o'clock at night.
[234:40.64]No, I don't want to be Pajama Havel.
[234:48.45]This is Havel's first day of school.
[234:54.65]I need to go back to the B. Okay, no.
[235:00.75]I can't wear all this.
[235:01.63]I might be able to keep on the Cookie Monster hands, though.
[235:09.74]That's possible.
[235:10.32]Let's see.
[235:13.86]You need some poise here.
[235:15.09]Black iron leggings.
[235:16.13]18.
[235:17.57]That's 28.
[235:20.69]That's so much.
[235:23.65]Elite is 12.
[235:29.70]18.
[235:29.74]What does that do for me?
[235:33.54]Let's put the weapon we were just using back on.
[235:37.24]I'm not going to use this thing.
[235:44.46]52 out of 100 still over it.
[235:47.94]So I have to take off the helmet.
[235:53.46]Nope, still not there.
[235:56.88]50.4.
[235:56.90]48.9.
[235:57.32]There we go.
[236:02.08]I can put it on the gloves.
[236:05.70]That'll give me some extra poise.
[236:06.62]Yeah, I got better poise now.
[236:11.95]Works out.
[236:16.02]Mr. Trumpstick.
[236:18.68]Alright, now I got a lot of these.
[236:22.91]I don't want to do too much of this because I need to go to the blacksmith.
[236:25.79]So I'm going to hold on to those for now.
[236:26.93]Let's level up my... What do I got?
[236:31.39]Endurance or vitality here.
[236:32.84]I think it's just endurance until 30.
[236:39.36]Crush one.
[236:40.62]No.
[236:41.48]Yeah, because I don't want to have zero.
[236:42.68]Yeah, I'm going to crush one.
[236:47.93]Get rid of this.
[236:48.39]That should bring me to... Let's see.
[236:51.56]I need one more.
[237:02.34]Proud Knight.
[237:04.08]That should take me there.
[237:08.49]20,000.
[237:08.71]Level up.
[237:09.39]Yeah!
[237:10.17]Alright.
[237:10.51]One more in Endurance.
[237:11.75]Get it to 30,000.
[237:17.14]Poises for cowards.
[237:19.50]No poises for bumblebees.
[237:20.80]Get it?
[237:21.06]Come on.
[237:21.42]You gotta get it right.
[237:24.08]Okay.
[237:24.98]Let's just keep... Oh, right.
[237:28.14]Alright.
[237:28.60]Hold on.
[237:30.60]We got an alright here.
[237:33.38]$100.
[237:35.72]Goddamn.
[237:38.38]You guys have been dropping some real money lately.
[237:42.72]Look at that top.
[237:43.48]Look at up there.

[238:39.77]I think you want to add another zero there.
[238:42.01]And maybe some more.
[238:45.89]You guys are too good to me.
[238:47.85]You guys spoil me like a rotten child.
[238:55.05]But thank you so much, everybody.
[238:57.19]And again, especially thank you, Pass.
[239:00.69]That's a lot of fucking money.
[239:06.23]Damn it.
[239:11.40]Swing, man.
[239:12.00]Swing.
[239:18.07]I should have had more Windows updates by now.
[239:19.73]That's true.
[239:20.15]I don't know what's going on.
[239:21.59]Why are we not getting them?
[239:25.03]Ninja makes that in five minutes?
[239:28.78]Do you see how many people are here?
[239:35.70]Doesn't Ninja get like 150,000 concurrent viewers?
[239:42.37]That's quite a lot more people that are here.
[239:53.29]Really?
[239:53.59]That didn't blow up good.
[239:59.61]Play Dark Souls with Drake.
[240:06.02]I don't know how that would work out so well, but...
[240:10.49]Silver Knight.
[240:11.13]I'm going to assume it's more Silver Knight.
[240:14.65]It is.
[240:15.81]You can look like those guys.
[240:16.87]That's kind of cool.
[240:17.61]You know how much more interesting?
[240:20.25]How much more respect would I get if I had that on right now?
[240:23.71]Instead of this.
[240:26.26]I don't know.
[240:27.34]We're not in it for the respect, though.
[240:28.56]We're in it to win it.
[240:32.26]I got at least 25 inches of padding before somebody hits me to the bone.
[240:40.72]Alright, so... I panicked a little bit here, so let's just keep looking around.
[240:45.00]Wah!
[240:45.64]Oh!
[240:47.20]Forgot, forgot he was there, forgot he was there.
[240:48.98]Oh my god, my whole fucking head, my head hurts.
[240:53.62]That caused pain, for real.
[240:55.26]I need to put on the other weapon for this.
[241:01.57]Give me the dragon thing.
[241:13.99]And a weapon's at risk, I know.
[241:16.39]Oh no, now I'm fat rolling.
[241:18.21]Well, we can deal with it.
[241:22.05]Or can we?
[241:32.22]What a mess.
[241:42.92]Oh my god, fat rolling is... How do people play this game with fat rolling?
[241:49.26]I have to go take this shit off.
[241:57.88]Is this guy susceptible to lightning or anything?
[242:00.34]Can I zap this dude?
[242:01.18]58, that's not bad.
[242:15.44]Fighting this guy in this room sucks, by the way.
[242:17.04]It's been a long time since we fought.
[242:23.40]I'm gonna die.
[242:35.77]I hate this room.
[242:37.67]It's like they put this guy in a room that is... Hey, where are you not ever supposed to fight this guy?
[242:42.71]How about a tiny room?
[242:46.30]Check on the other weapons.
[242:49.16]I don't think I can equip the occult, can I?
[242:57.89]I guess I can put it on.
[242:59.29]Try it.
[243:06.17]Poke him from the door?
[243:06.97]God.
[243:25.38]No, I'm gonna go back to the... I don't even know.
[243:28.48]I hate the room you have to fight him in.
[243:31.89]There's all this shit all over the ground that you bump into and get stuck on.
[243:37.71]I'm just dead here.
[243:40.22]Unfortunately.
[243:50.63]He's not even at 50%.
[243:52.57]What's even in here?
[243:53.57]Is there something in a box or something?
[243:55.33]What's the point of me doing this?
[243:57.35]Is it just, hey, fight this... Remember this guy?
[243:59.05]This funny guy that's a huge guy?
[244:00.57]Fight him in a tiny room?
[244:01.42]No.
[244:01.80]What's in here?
[244:02.32]Is there anything in this room?
[244:07.34]Just kill me.
[244:17.68]There's just nothing here.
[244:20.84]Remember, there's no point to most of this area.
[244:26.09]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[244:33.80]Only to get Demon Titanite?
[244:35.98]No, I don't even want it.
[244:47.45]They always fake me out.
[244:48.17]I feel like they're always going for a thrust.
[244:50.55]But then they lift the sword up and then they just fuck with me.
[245:00.68]Through the door.
[245:09.21]He's still in here.
[245:13.73]I can't believe he's still at Orlando.
[245:16.17]He's still in Orlando, Florida.
[245:19.49]I should have had that.
[245:27.06]Two Demon Titanite's pretty big.
[245:29.64]Probably is, but am I going to use it?
[245:32.06]Is the question.
[245:32.71]I don't think so.
[245:34.84]Probably not in the first playthrough.
[245:36.54]I have like the two weapons that I'm upgrading here.
[245:38.80]I don't know if I'm going to use those for anything in particular.
[245:44.08]Okay, here we are.
[245:45.52]I can go back this way or let's try to see what's up here.
[245:50.98]You might.
[245:51.34]Yeah, I know.
[245:52.02]But then I can always come back too, right?
[245:53.44]Okay, this is back.
[246:01.05]A couple of big guys.
[246:04.52]Too big, guys.
[246:05.32]How about up?
[246:13.78]Not the first area.
[246:15.88]Yeah, I'm still having trouble in the tutorial, guys.
[246:17.60]Just bear with me here.
[246:18.32]There's a hole in the wall.
[246:24.71]But why?
[246:27.61]What for?
[246:28.31]I'm not going down there yet.
[246:38.92]There's like a couple places to go here.
[246:47.49]Um... What's this?
[246:54.60]He's a worker!
[246:55.28]He's working on stuff!
[246:56.10]That's a blacksmith!
[246:57.42]Yes!
[246:59.82]I just saw his little baby hands going ding ding ding!
[247:04.20]Yeah!
[247:05.00]There he is!
[247:05.54]This guy's crazy.
[247:12.50]Nice First and foremost repair this please prepare everything pretty much Just prepare it all prepare everything get everything been tip-top shape I
[247:41.68]These are the things I'm wearing.
[247:50.07]Now let me crush one of my things.
[247:57.35]Large soul, use it.
[248:01.83]Okay, so let me think.
[248:04.47]I can upgrade this to plus six or so, modify equipment.
[248:12.83]Reinforced weapon.
[248:17.65]This needs 10,000 souls.
[248:27.69]I guess I can only upgrade my ice cream stick.
[248:43.00]I have to go back to the original blacksmith to get a plus six.
[248:49.36]Well, let me at least get the ice cream stick upgraded.
[248:51.56]Of course.
[249:06.99]Where are you?
[249:08.96]There you are.
[249:10.30]So this will get to four +2, which is I need a dragon skill.
[249:13.52]I have it.
[249:17.64]I need another 10,000 souls.
[249:18.94]I can do it one more time.
[249:27.13]Should be able to get the 10,000.
[249:29.61]With these, right?
[249:30.71]Yeah, I can maybe one.
[249:31.63]I'm going to use two of these.
[249:33.11]This should get me there.
[249:34.25]Yeah.
[249:37.19]A little over, but it's alright.
[249:45.05]Two dragon scale, +2, plus three.
[249:48.93]Okay.
[249:51.15]This thing's way better now.
[249:57.05]Can't upgrade anything else.
[250:01.82]And that's pretty much all I'm gonna do.
[250:07.60]What about armor?
[250:08.56]I mean, I know we've had this discussion before.
[250:11.79]I know I'm gonna wear the inflatable suit.
[250:15.73]I'm certain of it.
[250:17.07]Should I just get this to, like, plus one or +2?
[250:20.59]This is guaranteed to never come off my body.
[250:23.33]For the rest of the game.
[250:24.03]Guaranteed.
[250:28.65]Not worth it?
[250:29.03]It's just not worth the materials.
[250:36.50]Okay.
[250:38.58]Alright, well, I got... Now I'm going to put my ice cream back on.
[250:42.04]Because this thing is now almost 100 damage more than it was.
[250:49.51]Thank you, giant.
[250:51.29]This is a problem, because now I'm fat rolling.
[250:52.85]Okay.
[250:53.19]62.
[250:55.53]I'm going to have to take these off.
[250:59.78]Or these, maybe.
[251:07.39]I'm gonna lose poise, but he's a 9.
[251:09.75]Hard leather.
[251:18.04]Could just go naked again.
[251:23.02]Damn it.
[251:25.18]Oh no!
[251:28.69]That's not good.
[251:30.47]I have to take these off too?
[251:31.69]I need more endurance.
[251:35.51]There's still poise on the silver knight gauntlets.
[251:37.13]I'll put them on.
[251:37.85]Let's see about that.
[251:39.43]Alright, now can I... What do I have now?
[251:44.75]47.
[251:44.98]Anything I got?
[251:45.46]That's pants that weigh like 2 pounds.
[251:47.32]3 pounds.
[251:50.52]Leather.
[251:53.06]Okay.
[251:54.90]Black iron.
[251:55.34]That's too much.
[251:55.96]54.
[251:59.40]That's too much.
[252:04.86]51 49 I could put these boots on I could put those on leather boots What do you mean yoga?
[252:17.34]I don't see any yoga pants Where are the yoga pants?
[252:28.79]That's fine.
[252:29.19]That's better.
[252:29.65]Okay.
[252:30.51]I can use the black leather.
[252:31.95]Take the shield off.
[252:32.65]The shield is doing a lot of good things for my stamina.
[252:37.03]Let's test it on this guy.
[252:43.38]That's exactly what should have happened the first time.
[252:47.24]What you're talking about should have been able to one R1 these guys from the very beginning of this whole area.
[252:54.46]One solitary R1.
[253:01.48]Here's the shortcut.
[253:06.70]Beautiful.
[253:14.01]Okay.
[253:15.91]There's an item there that I kind of want.
[253:17.65]Watch.
[253:17.93]This guy can't fit through there.
[253:19.01]That's a little door.
[253:20.49]Everything's going to be fine.
[253:29.37]Come up here.
[253:32.53]That's a lot of damage.
[253:35.21]Another- There's three up here?
[253:36.39]There always is three.
[253:37.17]There always is a pair of three.
[253:41.03]Oh wait, you've got such like a strong burnt hamburger.
[253:47.03]It's very strong.
[253:47.85]There's a chunk.
[253:52.24]Okay.
[253:54.12]So should I get the bonfire again back here?
[253:57.16]Or do I just say fucking just keep this bonfire?
[254:05.57]I'm not sure which one is a better bonfire to have for the upcoming fights.
[254:17.68]Okay.
[254:18.76]Well, thanks for making my weapon not terrible.
[254:20.54]I appreciate it, man.
[254:26.81]Now at least I know where he is.
[254:37.59]That leads to this way.
[254:41.38]Didn't look over here.
[254:42.24]I want to go in here.
[254:44.24]Or do I?
[254:44.62]Can I get back in?
[254:51.55]Where does this take you?
[254:54.59]I mean, the curiosity is going to kill the cat here.
[254:57.25]This too let it have to go down.
[254:58.23]Okay.
[254:58.51]Okay.
[255:16.60]Dragonslayer Greatbow.
[255:18.68]It's the thing that they're using.
[255:22.46]I'm stuck up here.
[255:24.90]How do I get out of here?
[255:27.76]Oh.
[255:28.54]That way.
[255:34.26]Can I go through there?
[255:39.24]It locked me in a cage.
[255:40.32]No, I can go right through here.
[255:42.86]Well...
[255:47.32]And this is just back to where he was.
[255:56.57]Well, I can sell that.
[255:57.91]I gotta get to... I gotta go back to Frampt.
[256:03.27]I got so much stuff to sell him.
[256:09.03]I am Frampt.
[256:12.26]Feed me your weapons and I will...
[256:16.55]Be very thankful.
[256:22.17]I can go... This way.
[256:32.09]You have one of those big things.
[256:36.45]Now we both did the same thing and you got the lucky one and I didn't get the lucky one.
[256:42.32]Just die in one hit.
[256:44.34]Stupid.
[256:52.15]What's going on?
[256:53.85]What's going on?
[256:57.27]Don't Windows update me, Dark Souls.
[256:59.69]Why are you doing that?
[257:01.47]I had to just press circle to get out of that.
[257:07.28]Black Eye Orb is pulsing.
[257:08.86]Um, okay.
[257:15.78]He just died?
[257:16.94]Opportunity.
[257:19.70]It's still alive?
[257:22.35]No.
[257:24.27]What is he doing?
[257:24.95]What the fuck?
[257:25.51]He's healing.
[257:26.15]He healed to full health.
[257:27.69]Now that's just fun, isn't it?
[257:29.99]That's the fun.
[257:30.53]That is the boss.
[257:37.55]I'm gonna go up this way.
[257:38.31]I'm curious.
[257:44.00]What is up here?
[257:49.28]Alright, I'm going for it.
[257:50.34]I'm going to go for a... No, okay, I can get this guy from here.
[257:59.48]Give me a break.
[258:00.26]Why do you guys have to be so big?
[258:05.57]Where is this taking me now?
[258:08.53]This is back out here where the bonfire is.
[258:12.11]Not the bonfire, the skip, right?
[258:15.14]Yeah.
[258:17.42]Well, there are my souls.
[258:19.20]Did I have any?
[258:23.58]A little bit.
[258:28.59]This takes you back to the skip area.
[258:31.97]Up those stairs.
[258:36.15]Interesting.
[258:39.19]What's up here?
[258:44.66]I feel like I didn't even go up here.
[258:47.67]Maybe I... Did I come from here?
[258:49.11]I was up... Okay, now this is back this way.
[258:58.48]Okay.
[259:03.74]I'm lost?
[259:04.26]No, I'm not.
[259:04.98]I'm just looking around.
[259:06.07]I'm trying to, like, keep my brain to remember where the hell I'm even going.
[259:13.51]Because this is where the big dude is.
[259:14.99]And then this is where the stairs here go down.
[259:17.49]I'm just going to refill.
[259:22.49]Look, I'm not just going to rush to the boss.
[259:25.14]I want to be prepared.
[259:28.22]Look, I know.
[259:28.94]We've talked about this.
[259:29.74]I know you've probably seen somebody beat this boss 5,000 times.
[259:36.77]I'm aware.
[259:37.53]I'm aware that this game came out in 2011.
[259:40.51]And you yourself may have beaten the next boss 95 times.
[259:47.51]But let me just fucking get ready.
[259:55.97]This is my first experience of the game.
[259:57.35]I don't want to just rush through it.
[259:58.99]That would be ruining the game for me.
[260:14.56]I can do this.
[260:15.06]Give it one or two.
[260:16.06]Yeah, I got enough.
[260:17.22]I need to get like 21 more of the little ones.
[260:37.85]Alright.
[260:41.05]Done with Endurance for now.
[260:42.29]Let's go back to Vitality.
[260:50.79]So that takes us back over here.
[260:54.47]Through the secret door.
[260:57.39]One-hit kill this guy.
[261:01.98]Ass like that.
[261:08.40]Oh, I thought I dodged it.
[261:09.54]Oh well.
[261:09.74]I don't think I need to fight these guys.
[261:14.12]But I'm going to so he doesn't follow me all the way over here.
[261:22.00]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[261:25.92]Just go.
[261:26.82]Just run by them.
[261:27.60]You don't have to touch them.
[261:28.48]Just run by them.
[261:29.76]I know where the door is.
[261:30.66]I'm a waste of fucking three Estes.
[261:35.92]Seriously.
[261:40.86]Fucking god damn it, man.
[261:43.77]I still have to kill these guys because I want to just do it just because.
[261:56.94]The camera can just be in the wall, that's great.
[261:58.68]Alright, if one more person tells me to use the orb, I'm going to turn off the fucking stream.
[262:12.83]Are you ready?
[262:13.27]Alright, here we go!
[262:17.69]It's going off!
[262:31.62]Alright, here we go!
[262:33.70]Use orb!
[262:34.42]Use orb!
[262:34.88]Hurry, please!
[262:35.54]God!
[262:36.58]Nothing satiates my anger unless you use the fucking orb!
[262:42.30]Entire chat is orb!
[262:44.56]Don't ever turn off!
[262:45.58]Put orb on!
[262:46.46]Only orb!
[262:47.16]Do it!
[262:47.54]Go!
[262:48.08]Hurry!
[262:50.88]I can't even do it!
[262:57.52]I have to do it!
[263:00.89]No!
[263:01.47]Xbox, please!
[263:03.61]Oh, I did it!
[263:15.06]Are you happy?
[263:15.61]Are you happy I pressed the OR button?
[263:28.66]Let's go see the funny secret thing to do.
[263:36.99]Who the fuck are these people?
[263:38.45]Okay, these are the bad guys.
[263:41.73]I just got into the evil lair.
[263:42.93]The henchmen are gonna come out.
[263:43.77]I'm gonna kill them both in one swing.
[263:46.83]Just watch.
[263:50.46]Oh, it's three on one.
[263:51.52]Alright, that's fine.
[263:53.20]I'm dead.
[263:57.76]What happens if I die here?
[264:02.94]Am I stuck here forever?
[264:03.78]Am I gonna get stuck in another painting?
[264:05.10]I wish I could press X right now.
[264:11.96]They're just like chasing me around.
[264:23.32]Oh, that's a corner.
[264:23.94]Well, I'm in the corner.
[264:24.66]Game over.
[264:27.82]Fuck away from me!
[264:30.97]I did it!
[265:20.39]Quick, use the orb!
[265:21.43]Do it again!
[265:21.95]Alright, are you happy?
[265:30.66]Are you satisfied?
[265:31.68]Have you been satisfied that I killed the three guys?
[265:34.88]What is this?
[265:58.50]Now here's the front door.
[265:59.54]Oh, that's better.
[266:02.40]Look at that.
[266:03.24]So now I can just run right through.
[266:04.50]Use ring.
[266:08.58]Why?
[266:09.18]You guys.
[266:09.98]You guys, come.
[266:11.06]Give me a second.
[266:13.22]This is like Twitch plays Dark Souls through angry fucking insecure human.
[266:20.89]It breaks when I take it off.
[266:22.45]Wait a minute.
[266:22.93]Hold on.
[266:24.83]I can never take this off ever again.
[266:30.11]wait wait just hold on I opened up the front door which means I can now I can go like this I can I'm gonna go back and just sit I'm gonna I just want to say I wanted that I want this spawned by this looks like a much easier run just running right through
[266:59.95]It's longer.
[267:00.51]Is this a- Is it- It's a straight- You're just- You walk straight.
[267:07.07]Oh my god.
[267:19.40]Sometimes I forget I'm playing Dark Souls.
[267:21.28]A.K.A.
[267:22.28]I'm holding Chat's family hostage.
[267:28.53]I forgot streaming Dark Souls blind is I'm holding chat's family hostage.
[267:42.36]I need to go back down.
[267:48.78]Let them go.
[267:49.54]Look, this is a nicer run for me.
[267:56.56]It's just slow and easy.
[267:59.71]I can just walk right through the front door.
[268:01.13]I don't have to worry about running by like the two silver knights.
[268:05.78]This is how I'm going to do it.
[268:07.78]This is how I'm going to do it.
[268:12.24]That's the way it is.
[268:15.13]This is just no enemies.
[268:16.31]There's two guys at the front door.
[268:17.53]I'm just going to walk by.
[268:18.37]Yeah.
[268:28.35]Jump off the edge.
[268:29.43]Secret.
[268:31.03]Secret.
[268:35.89]Secret.
[268:36.53]109?
[268:36.55]What do you mean 109?
[268:39.35]See, look, I can just relax.
[268:40.83]I can just press the lever and go in the front door.
[268:47.34]Even if it is slower, I don't even care.
[268:57.51]I don't care if this is a full five minutes longer.
[269:08.49]Look, no enemies.
[269:10.13]There's nothing scary.
[269:10.99]It's just a big door.
[269:11.91]It's just a big door in the center.
[269:21.94]Look, all I have to do is just walk through these guys.
[269:23.80]They're pretty much like a welcoming party.
[269:27.05]That's all I gotta do.
[269:28.05]And then right through here.
[269:30.99]It's just these guys.
[269:31.97]That's it.
[269:36.41]Ow, he hit me with the fucking... He hit me with the needle point of that.
[269:40.97]Okay, avoid this guy.
[269:45.77]I couldn't see.
[269:48.35]He blocked my view.
[269:49.21]They work together to do that.
[269:52.73]That was such horseshit.
[269:54.78]He fucking just did like a basketball block on me.
[270:02.38]It's supposed to be an easier run.
[270:04.53]What?
[270:42.58]Should have had a separate spoiler chat for Dark Souls.
[270:46.38]It's not even spoilers.
[270:50.88]It's nothing to do with spoilers.
[270:52.14]I don't care about like tips and spoilers, but like commands.
[271:03.29]What do you fucking think you're doing?
[271:05.09]What do you think you're doing?
[271:07.21]The thing just showed up on your screen and said, look at your dark orb.
[271:11.80]You've never seen or heard of this before.
[271:14.18]Open it and press it.
[271:15.00]Press it right now.
[271:16.42]Give me my family back.
[271:18.04]You have my family in there.
[271:19.92]It's there inside the orb.
[271:21.08]Crack it or they're all going to go away.
[271:33.15]Okay, let's see.
[271:34.27]Where is the easy... Can I close the door?
[271:37.05]No, I'm going to go this way.
[271:42.19]Hugging that wall.
[271:45.21]Get that stamina back.
[271:49.23]Oh my god, you slow enemies.
[271:50.59]The slow enemies are the worst.
[271:51.49]Okay, can I see what this boss is?
[272:00.09]Let's go.
[272:01.69]Boss time.
[272:08.52]Oh, going up against the frog.
[272:15.41]The frog and the cat.
[272:17.99]I've seen this, like, this Japanese proverb before.
[272:21.83]This, like, Japanese story.
[272:23.01]Like, the frog and the cat.
[272:23.90]Oh, it's too... Oh, no.
[272:24.82]Okay, that's a slow... Oh, my God.
[272:33.14]Okay, wait a minute.
[272:35.47]Okay, it's big guy and little guy.
[272:36.85]Big guy, little guy.
[272:37.69]I got it.
[272:38.73]Little guy got to die first, definitely, because little guy way, way faster than big guy.
[272:44.55]Can I separate them?
[272:53.48]Oh, owie.
[272:55.88]Can they hurt each other?
[272:56.66]Is it like friendly fire?
[272:57.48]Okay, that's a slow move.
[273:01.06]Very slow, very slow.
[273:03.03]They both move very slowly.
[273:04.61]Okay, hold on a minute here.
[273:06.88]I'm alive.
[273:08.80]Not for long.
[273:09.24]I definitely don't want to fight them both at the same time.
[273:22.31]That's a... They're just like the Ninja Turtles.
[273:24.43]What were those two?
[273:25.23]The turtle and the wolf...
[273:35.37]Ooh, he's right behind me, okay.
[273:39.72]Just get out of the way, out of the fucking way.
[273:49.58]Holy shit, here he comes with the train!
[274:09.06]Back it up.
[274:11.66]Ooh, I didn't see you.
[274:13.68]Didn't see him.
[274:28.92]I got the... Ornstein is almost dead.
[274:31.52]Ornstein.
[274:41.89]I wish they... I need you to go slower than that, man.
[274:47.36]God damn it.
[274:48.04]I need you to go slower than this.
[274:49.22]Well, now you're too slow.
[274:56.99]Okay, that's what I wanted.
[275:02.41]Holy shit, he's right here.
[275:08.95]Shit, bad...
[275:13.37]Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[275:23.30]He needs to like zip all the way over here like he just did.
[275:32.48]Oh, but not like this.
[275:33.54]Excuse me.
[275:42.87]Where is he?
[275:48.54]Here he comes.
[276:04.40]Alright, Ornstein down.
[276:07.10]No, no, no.
[276:07.44]What is he like?
[276:09.69]What does this mean?
[276:12.81]Does he turn into like another guy?
[276:13.95]Oh!
[276:22.54]Okay, now he supercharged the frog.
[276:25.52]Oh god.
[276:32.28]Holy fuck!
[276:33.54]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[276:35.12]Okay, hold on.
[276:44.33]Play it easy.
[276:44.71]It's only one guy.
[276:56.15]Let's get to full health.
[277:09.36]Oh!
[277:09.74]I'm not... Oh my god.
[277:10.57]I need humanity.
[277:12.43]I'm dead.
[277:13.11]Fuck!
[277:15.11]Oh, god damn it.
[277:15.93]I just ran out of health.
[277:19.21]Oh, that sucks.
[277:24.08]Hey, but please, like, please have, like, hey, please have throwing knives and black fire bombs on your bar.
[277:30.36]For no fucking reason.
[277:34.06]Idiot.
[277:39.15]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[277:47.97]I may have actually got that heal up.
[277:51.22]if I didn't have throwing knives on my bar like a brainless moron just make sure you have a fire bomb because you know you have one there just leave it there forever just treat it like a pop figurine on your desk
[278:29.82]Let's try it again.
[278:35.97]Use the orb to make the fight easier.
[278:39.97]I'm going the wrong way.
[278:41.05]God damn it.
[278:59.11]I thought I had chance.
[278:59.71]You know, it's just trying to determine.
[279:02.40]If I didn't get hit by that, like, train move, you gotta dodge to the right.
[279:06.70]You have to dodge almost through it.
[279:09.84]No, to the left, probably.
[279:11.40]I'm trying to think of the best way to get to that.
[279:12.91]Because I got hit by that train move, like, three times.
[279:14.95]I feel like I should put on the other, that other item, too.
[279:24.47]It's kind of too late now, is it?
[279:33.51]I haven't used these at all.
[279:34.53]I really need to, though.
[279:41.86]Go back in the painting.
[279:46.86]Can you please, seriously?
[279:47.88]Like, why do you have to have these guys here in front of the boss door?
[279:50.00]Like, do you really have to do that?
[279:53.39]You have to do that.
[279:54.03]Like, just, it's so hard enough to do this shit.
[279:56.09]Like, why do you have to have that guy there?
[279:59.69]Really?
[280:01.67]What just fucking happened there?
[280:06.30]I got hit through the door, didn't I?
[280:07.48]Yeah, I did.
[280:19.65]I also might go back and heal.
[280:21.63]Hold on.
[280:30.27]I need that +2 Estus Flask.
[280:32.77]Like, very badly.
[280:33.71]I feel like it would help immensely.
[280:53.18]Is there a point to hurting the both or is he going to get full health anyways?
[280:57.32]I would assume probably not.
[281:13.84]Ouch, ouch, ouch.
[281:18.20]There it is, I got hit by it again.
[281:19.18]He rears it back.
[281:21.56]He pulls it back.
[281:23.53]He goes, oh!
[281:24.65]See, that's why it's hitting me.
[281:28.91]There we go.
[281:29.43]That's easy to dodge there.
[281:31.39]Now I get how that move works.
[281:42.46]Fuck, I just gotta get out of the way.
[281:45.52]He's stuck in the corner now.
[281:46.46]I'm fucked.
[281:48.55]I'm going back to Firelink.
[281:50.53]I want that +2.
[281:51.31]This is stupid without it.
[281:56.78]I'm just gimping myself so hard without being able to have a better heal there.
[282:02.16]I have to go somewhere where I can get that +2.
[282:05.68]Because this is actually really stupid to not have it.
[282:08.78]Alright, where was that lady?
[282:19.94]Oh, not necessarily.
[282:20.88]Not Firelink.
[282:21.52]Where's the lady?
[282:30.88]Trying to think of where that lady was.
[282:32.06]That wasn't that far, was it?
[282:35.02]Going back to, um... What, uh... Where was she?
[282:42.79]She was a fire keeper.
[282:43.75]It wasn't the spider.
[283:03.97]It's at the first bonfire of Anor Lando.
[283:07.77]So... If I... Oh my god, I'm trying my brain.
[283:12.33]This is why I just hate not having fast travel, because I have to, like, backtrack through the whole game to get +2 Estus Blast.
[283:29.78]It would be back this way, right?
[283:42.20]You don't need +2?
[283:43.00]You almost had it.
[283:44.06]Yeah, I know, but like, it's... As you can see, when I get hit by something, having to drink twice to heal what I should be just to drink once, I'm just using extra Estus for no reason.
[283:58.28]Might as well just do it, just to give myself the best chance.
[284:01.26]Because I already missed one.
[284:03.94]Shouldn't I technically... I should technically already be at, like, plus three, right?
[284:11.24]I definitely should not be at plus one at this point.
[284:32.47]It's back here.
[284:35.35]Okay.
[284:37.39]And then... Where am I going?
[284:49.80]Let's back this way.
[284:50.40]Alright, hold on.
[284:51.90]So... Let me see what this does.
[284:54.68]Holy shit.
[285:04.53]Oh my god, this thing is insane.
[285:08.93]I can just never take this off.
[285:09.97]Don't ever take it off, right?
[285:10.83]120 equipment load...
[285:17.83]That's so much stamina and health to get for this.
[285:19.65]Alright, it's going on.
[285:29.64]It's never coming back.
[285:31.00]I have to just never take it off.
[285:34.48]That's probably the... I'm putting it on.
[285:36.92]It's on.
[285:40.33]Oh my god.
[285:41.11]Look at my endurance bar.
[285:44.97]So I could, if I had this on, I probably would have beat it.
[285:50.93]The plebs wanted the best for you.
[285:55.83]No, I never doubted the orb.
[285:57.37]I just, that's all I saw in the whole chat room.
[286:01.42]I didn't see anything else.
[286:03.64]I'm sitting there trying to figure out what it is and people just tell me, screaming at me to click on it.
[286:08.30]I don't know, people told me to click on the painting.
[286:23.93]Usually when the chat's the loudest, that means they're trying to get me to do something crazy.
[286:28.95]Wait, this is not correct.
[286:38.30]Where's this first bonfire?
[286:40.46]Like, through here?
[286:41.22]I just don't remember.
[286:42.74]I just don't remember.
[286:46.34]This was so long ago.
[286:47.22]This was actually probably four hours ago.
[286:49.72]It was the last time I was standing in this room.
[286:54.49]Oh, it's down here to the left.
[286:55.31]Okay.
[287:13.58]Alright.
[287:15.60]What do I got for you?
[287:20.99]So I can use this to bring the lady back.
[287:24.01]Or I can do plus to get an upgrade.
[287:28.44]I mean, can I do that with any of these?
[287:33.94]This is another one of those moments where everyone's going to scream at me to not do this.
[287:47.82]This one is special.
[287:51.19]This is the only one that can revive her.
[287:56.89]Alright, well, so what do I get for doing that?
[288:01.84]The bonfire at Firelink will always be out if I use it.
[288:13.24]I guess that is fairly important.
[288:14.70]That bonfire is just so necessary.
[288:19.08]No... No, let's just do it.
[288:22.57]That putting that ring on is essentially me adding health and stamina and defense.
[288:28.29]Yeah, we're running all the way back.
[288:29.17]What's gonna burn?
[288:33.35]I'll hold on to it.
[288:40.42]I put that ring on... That's gonna be... That's so much more for all these stats.
[288:57.35]I can't get hit by the guy that runs through behind me.
[289:05.74]The Dark Souls classic.
[289:12.89]The Fappenhavel rings.
[289:18.11]Also, I can do this now.
[289:19.19]Alright, so... Silver Knight is...
[289:27.27]It's 52.
[289:29.31]Silver Knight is... Can I put these on?
[289:32.89]I can still put these on and not be fat rolling.
[289:34.45]I'm looking for like 60-something, right?
[289:39.45]66.
[289:43.73]That's too much.
[289:50.97]61.
[289:50.99]Elite Knight might be okay.
[289:54.03]Or Silver Knight.
[289:55.87]Did I get those?
[289:56.95]Silver Knight.
[289:57.49]There we go.
[289:59.67]61.
[290:01.57]Oh my god, I look so dumb.
[290:12.38]I look so awful.
[290:18.06]Alright, let's try it again.
[290:33.17]Come on, just don't get hit.
[290:34.39]Don't you understand?
[290:34.99]That's how it works.
[290:35.87]Just don't get hit.
[290:39.76]I went from a bee to a beetle.
[290:40.90]Alright, regardless, after I beat these two, I'm going to conclude tonight's stream.
[290:52.75]So, however long that takes, I'm going to try to win.
[290:56.37]The stream will be over at the end of that.
[291:05.88]This is fat fuck Hollow Knight.
[291:12.08]It really is, isn't it?
[291:14.28]Okay, I dodged it, like... It's just wastes of waste.
[291:27.67]It's such a waste to have to go here.
[291:31.00]It's a waste!
[291:34.01]It's a waste.
[291:34.61]Look at the... Whoa!
[291:41.73]He's already here.
[291:42.49]God damn it.
[291:43.10]I didn't even get a chance to do it.
[291:50.90]I hate that shit.
[291:51.90]The guy's as big as the whole fucking zone.
[291:54.30]Like, you can't... The term I'm looking for here is not cool.
[292:06.58]And there's a tactic.
[292:07.52]Hey, there's a tactic.
[292:17.82]What'd I miss?
[292:28.03]You see what I'm talking about though?
[292:28.97]Like, this is... I feel like I don't need to do that twice.
[292:31.63]Like, that's such shit healing.
[292:36.22]I need to go get the other one.
[292:37.69]I really do.
[292:38.25]It's so bad.
[293:04.63]I need you to dive over here so I can sidestep you.
[293:08.30]Please.
[293:19.38]Please.
[293:20.30]Come on.
[293:29.31]Come over here.
[293:45.04]One more step.
[293:45.50]That was weird.
[293:48.12]I don't know.
[293:48.62]That was strange.
[293:49.14]That was really strange.
[293:51.00]He's moving around like a weirdo.
[293:52.22]What is he doing?
[293:52.92]What's this weirdo shit that he's doing?
[293:57.41]Damn it.
[294:00.37]I'm so off-putting.
[294:10.07]That's almost trouble.
[294:14.04]Yeah, I'm fucked.
[294:17.30]This is probably it.
[294:25.05]Whoa, I... Alright.
[294:30.61]I almost had a free... You know what?
[294:31.47]I actually might need to take a break.
[294:34.03]I'm just gonna die.
[294:35.77]This is, like, too much for me right now.
[294:41.64]I really want that extra healing.
[294:44.07]It sucks having to drink two Estuses to heal from getting hit one time.
[294:52.05]I really need it.
[294:53.17]Desperately.
[294:53.63]There's only so much Dark Souls I can physically take before I have to stop playing.
[295:08.90]Ugh.
[295:12.55]Also, I want to do this.
[295:13.55]Like, I feel like this is just killing me here.
[295:17.89]Even though it's going to be less damage, I'm just so open to be... I need to get this upgraded, too.
[295:23.10]There's so many things I wish I could do that I didn't have to run all the way backwards to the blacksmith for.
[295:31.08]If I could just fast travel right there and get this, like, to plus six and then get it to, like, plus eight or something.
[295:37.57]I just... It's irritating that I have to do that.
[295:51.97]Just try fast rolling the boss.
[295:53.29]Let's just... Yeah, let's do that too.
[295:54.79]Where are we at now?
[296:01.61]Still mid-rolling.
[296:02.29]Alright, let's try this.
[296:20.75]I'm going the wrong way again.
[296:22.03]The armor combination gets worse every time.
[296:28.72]It just sucks that I was so close that first try and now I'm just like... I'm just physically exhausted.
[296:39.86]These games are exhausting.
[296:46.58]I guess I could put on the fucking electricity shit too.
[296:49.12]Just see what I can do.
[296:50.46]Do I have any fire?
[296:51.36]Let's see.
[297:12.12]So I'm an NPC?
[297:12.84]No, no way.
[297:15.45]I'm very confident I can beat this.
[297:17.71]For sure.
[297:19.39]I got close enough the first try.
[297:21.26]I need to be in the right mood and mindset.
[297:26.80]Let's see if I can just do something here.
[297:42.24]Whoa, that's what happens in the camera.
[297:43.90]No, really don't do that.
[297:44.94]Come on.
[297:45.32]Don't have that guy be there and hit me Watch out for you Oh, that's not good
[298:17.50]Really?
[299:06.08]Excuse me.
[299:21.83]No, you're too close.
[299:24.54]What a waste of electricity move.
[299:37.18]Come on, I gotta get you.
[299:38.46]Come on!
[299:40.34]No!
[299:43.52]Do it!
[299:45.85]Oh, fuck you.
[299:47.55]Fuck you.
[300:19.00]No, why did you kick?
[300:20.64]Of all the things to have happen.
[300:23.90]I hate that fucking move.
[300:25.80]I wish I could disable it.
[300:28.14]Honest to God.
[300:29.46]I wish I could turn off the kick.
[300:31.00]It just happens for no reason sometimes.
[300:33.50]It's so... Calm down.
[300:46.09]I gotta turn... I gotta...
[300:55.50]Close.
[301:01.14]That was quick.
[301:05.97]That was quick too.
[301:06.77]Fucking asshole.
[301:14.87]He's gonna do it again.
[301:16.73]Gotta be ready.
[301:26.16]One more hit.
[301:30.83]Oh, come on!
[301:31.59]The range!
[301:32.81]The range!
[301:33.75]Why are you doing this to me?
[301:38.41]Oh, come on.
[301:39.47]Fuck you, range.
[301:41.09]That's such... Give me a fucking break.
[301:50.03]It was like a quarter of a goddamn fucking centimeter.
[302:06.77]That's so dumb.
[302:26.83]I was going better.
[302:27.55]I feel like I was playing better.
[302:57.25]I definitely need to stop playing though.
[302:59.85]I'm starting to get that true exhaustion where anger is becoming exhaustion and exhaustion is becoming like hatred.
[303:09.95]You know what I'm talking about?
[303:11.65]We're like, oh, what the fuck, I'm angry!
[303:13.17]Now I'm exhausted and angry, and, like, I hate this game.
[303:17.09]That's, like, the path that's going down after, like, another three or four deaths at this fight.
[303:35.27]No, get out of the fucking way.
[303:38.47]Why are you here?
[303:39.91]Why are you here?
[303:41.19]Patch him out.
[303:42.13]Patch this guy out of the game.
[303:44.15]Remaster.
[303:45.35]Fucking remaster?
[303:46.89]No, go back and redo it.
[303:57.62]I'm dead.
[304:01.90]I'm fucking dead.
[304:12.45]God damn it, man.
[304:14.37]This is so dumb.
[304:18.90]They put this asshole right before the gate that you have to desperately get the fuck away from.
[304:23.60]And in this unbearable fight.
[304:44.92]I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[304:46.67]Somewhere over there.
[305:01.68]It also hurts, too, that this is just a plus five.
[305:05.94]This is just not going to happen.
[305:08.14]It could if I played really well.
[305:09.70]Like, it could happen.
[305:10.40]But I'm just unnecessarily gimped right now.
[305:14.80]Both with my Estus and with my weapon.
[305:19.82]I could be coming in here and hitting for so much harder.
[305:21.91]And healing for so much more.
[305:23.17]It's just like, fuck me.
[305:24.35]Yeah.
[305:30.67]That's it.
[305:32.03]If I don't beat it right now, I have to go back and level up shit.
[305:36.22]Especially for a fight that's supposed to be like this.
[305:38.95]No.
[305:39.55]That ain't gonna fucking happen.
[305:46.66]102 damage a swing here.
[305:47.52]I need to be doing like 130.
[306:08.75]He looks like he just hit him.
[306:11.83]He like hit him in the face with the hammer.
[306:19.46]I'm so in trouble here.
[306:26.48]The burger was doing more damage.
[306:27.73]Yeah, but I just... It's so hard to use one of those against these guys right now.
[306:32.56]One swing is like... And I almost... You know, it's just a question of... I'm in that, like, denial phase where I hate everything.
[306:41.45]So I'm gonna have to stop playing.
[306:43.81]You know, I'm in the phase right now where literally I despise everything right now.
[306:47.59]So I have to stop.
[306:52.50]That's where you know it's, like, time for a break.
[306:54.46]When you're just like, oh, I hate this game and everything about it.
[306:59.20]You really have to.
[307:00.32]You have to stop.
[307:03.84]You have to.
[307:04.54]Yeah, see what I'm doing?
[307:05.64]I'm stopping.
[307:06.21]I wonder if it's... Oh, good idea.
[307:15.33]To... Let's see.
[307:26.64]Am I still mid-rolling?
[307:37.00]Okay, hold on.
[307:37.66]Let me... Is that still a mid-roll?
[307:40.08]How?
[307:41.00]Really?
[307:41.28]I almost just took it off.
[307:45.34]In this, like, fucking anger that I'm in right now.
[307:48.80]Holy shit, that would have been so bad.
[307:54.16]What am I, 30 right now?
[307:56.10]I don't think I can wear anything. 25%.
[308:07.01]I can't wear anything.
[308:07.95]It's got to come off.
[308:09.32]I have to try it.
[308:09.82]I have to try at least once with just the hamburger.
[308:22.90]They'll be easier tomorrow.
[308:24.24]Yeah, I know.
[308:25.02]It's just that... I'm at that stage where my face is like sweaty.
[308:35.86]I just hate missing shit, and I should have just upgraded these other things.
[308:41.44]Because I really don't want to use this here.
[308:42.72]It's so slow and it leaves you so vulnerable.
[308:46.26]That, as you saw, even like swinging it, I just leave myself.
[308:50.18]Just, hey, come and do the dashing spear thing and murder me.
[308:52.83]This is the last attempt.
[308:56.97]Final attempt here.
[308:58.59]And then I'm going to take a break.
[309:00.31]I am not streaming tomorrow, though.
[309:02.57]The next time you will see me live will be Saturday.
[309:06.56]Saturday afternoon And we'll continue and if I don't beat them right now, but I'm going to beat them the first time we turn the game on Yeah It's a fucking magic show I can't believe I just I can't believe it I can gold pine this No, I can't this is technically a really I
[309:36.25]Wow, I can.
[309:37.27]Oh, come on, man.
[309:38.85]Not even going to give me a second.
[309:43.72]No, I... Alright, you can't do that here.
[309:49.28]There's a chance that he will literally, when you come in the door, will attack you.
[309:57.83]That's a terrible start.
[309:59.95]I just want to see what it does for damage.
[310:01.91]Come on, for the love of God.
[310:10.00]It's not a question of tilting myself, it's a question of getting hit right when you open the fog gate.
[310:15.92]It's not fair.
[310:21.47]It hurts, but I really need to do the running swing.
[310:24.13]It's just too slow.
[310:50.21]Here he comes, fat guy.
[310:51.47]Try killing smog first.
[311:02.87]Yeah, I'm probably doing this wrong, but I just, I have to stop playing.
[311:08.48]I just do.
[311:10.20]I can always tell when, like, shit ain't going well and, like, I'm just tired and, like, mentally exhausted here.
[311:18.37]That's how you know when it's time to... It's time to stop.
[311:22.50]Because, like, I'm losing fundamentals, too.
[311:24.68]Like, I'm just like, fucking run and swing.
[311:26.22]I don't even want to.
[311:27.04]Fucking game's dumb.
[311:29.96]You're on, like, full tilt.
[311:37.90]Yeah, that's it.
[311:40.18]And that's... It.
[311:58.94]Yeah, that's it.
[312:08.76]It's like the casino, right?
[312:09.80]Dark Souls, seriously, is like the casino.
[312:12.93]I love this game.
[312:13.73]I think it's fucking fantastic.
[312:14.85]I love everything about it.
[312:16.91]But man, if you lose like $500 in a slot machine, you have to get up from the fucking slot machine.
[312:22.51]You have to.
[312:23.01]Otherwise, you're going to lose everything.
[312:52.54]Alright, I got my last hundred dollar bill.
[312:54.77]My last hundred dollar bill.
[312:55.87]Here it comes.
[312:56.55]Final hundred dollar bill.
[313:03.83]I lost it all.
[313:05.17]I got one more bill in my pocket and I just sat down at the first machine I saw.
[313:09.30]This is it.
[313:17.48]This is it, this is it, this is it.
[313:19.48]The end, the end, the end.
[313:20.17]This is the end.
[313:38.70]I'm like, how's sub?
[313:39.54]Yeah, turn off sub mode.
[313:40.64]Let him loose.
[313:41.68]Let him loose.
[313:42.60]I didn't even know it was on.
[313:46.71]Oh, fuck.
[313:49.25]I lost like $40 on one spin already.
[313:51.81]Okay, the Estus Flask is how much money I have left.
[314:03.30]I'm down to $90.
[314:03.78]It's $10 for one swig.
[314:14.11]Come on, I can do it.
[314:14.78]If I last, like, $10.
[314:15.16]Let's go.
[315:32.40]60 bucks.
[316:10.06]Bring it on, come on!
[316:11.56]60 bucks!
[316:12.58]I got 60 dollars left!
[316:14.69]Let's go!
[316:51.70]50.
[316:52.60]I got one $50 bill.
[316:53.54]You fat fuck.
[317:19.30]Come here.
[317:36.14]Two in a row, fuck you.
[317:59.82]Jackpot!
[318:19.92]$50,000 for that.
[318:21.14]Goddamn.
[318:25.64]Okay.
[318:43.33]Sometimes you gotta, my last hundred bucks turned into 50,000, man.
[318:53.41]Now what do I do?
[318:54.01]There's a chest in here?
[319:06.53]Oh.
[319:07.55]Wait, hold on.
[319:10.69]Now it's time to turn off the game.
[319:25.37]That was intense.
[319:30.66]The thing about that fight though, that fight's like not unfair.
[319:35.38]Just the very beginning.
[319:36.54]Just when he like can hit you for one second.
[319:39.84]That's not, that fight's not unfair.
[319:48.79]I think, what's up here?
[319:53.64]There's a big chest ahead?
[319:55.69]I'm looking forward to it.
[320:01.97]Ooh!
[320:02.63]It's that guy's stuff.
[320:14.86]This is the biggest chest I'm ever gonna find.
[320:16.54]Okay.
[320:16.80]There's like a bunch of items in this chest.
[320:23.44]Let me rest here.
[320:25.03]And level... Level up.
[320:30.45]Vitality.
[320:32.83]Two points in vitality.
[320:40.80]Let's see.
[320:44.16]What's the biggest chest in the game?
[320:53.48]Why is she so huge?
[321:04.91]This is a trick?
[321:06.05]Or should I forward R2?
[321:07.23]Okay, sure.
[321:14.08]Oh, Chosen Undead.
[321:16.66]I am Guinevere.
[321:19.24]How many attempts was that on Smog and... Smog?
[321:22.20]Oh yay.
[321:23.20]Oh yay, I got the item.
[321:24.66]Thank God.
[321:25.26]I can now teleport.
[321:52.66]What if I, like, shot an arrow right into her head?
[321:56.82]Okay.
[321:57.76]So, now I can actually fast travel.
[322:00.26]All the things I complained about are now gone from the game.
[322:04.00]Let's fast travel back.
[322:07.09]Warp.
[322:08.99]Oh.
[322:10.13]My god, I've missed you so much.
[322:14.93]I've missed this.
[322:16.13]I've missed you.
[322:27.26]So now I can bring this lady back to life?
[322:39.53]Return Firekeeper Soul.
[322:43.87]So this is something I should be doing, right?
[322:57.19]I let her die.
[322:58.01]Oh, I didn't know.
[322:58.79]I didn't let her die.
[322:59.89]She just kind of died.
[323:00.91]I mean, she did die.
[323:06.49]She's back.
[323:10.85]So, now you're going to give me some stuff in return.
[323:13.27]Can you give me something for this?
[323:25.11]Alright, now should I go back and kill the other lady that's standing at the other one?
[323:42.98]Well, I just lost a +2, man.
[323:44.74]Come on.
[323:50.05]There it is.
[323:50.47]Rest at this bonfire.
[323:54.05]alright I have a couple of things I want to look at here before I the stream I am going to end the stream though
[324:08.08]Right when you're at the darkest.
[324:10.20]Right when you feel yourself like, fucking hate you.
[324:14.02]Look, in every cartoon, every anime, every Marvel movie you've ever seen.
[324:19.56]It's over.
[324:21.65]The bad guy wins.
[324:23.29]And there's no hope.
[324:24.79]And Captain America's lying on his back.
[324:27.29]And he's like, I've been defeated.
[324:28.77]I hate everything.
[324:29.51]I'm not a superhero.
[324:31.07]All of a sudden, his eyes light up.
[324:33.33]He opens his eyes.
[324:34.13]And he has some revelation.
[324:35.34]And he just goes...
[324:36.96]And he turns into the strongest he's ever fucking been.
[324:55.81]Wrong superhero.
[324:58.12]It doesn't matter.
[324:58.78]It's...
[325:00.39]I hit the bottom.
[325:02.11]I landed right in the bottom of the well, but my superpowers, like, I was like, no, I'm fighting for justice.
[325:07.89]And I flew out of the well, and in a straight shot, my hand went right through the guy's jaw, and I kept going, and it didn't stop.
[325:14.38]I went into the stars, into the atmosphere, into the cosmos, and I became a fucking supernova star, and I exploded and turned into 15 new planets.
[325:24.10]And I'm just a giant face in the sky, and I look down, and I'm like, yes, mm-hmm.
[325:27.28]That's what just happened.
[325:32.99]I kind of already know what this is because I remember watching somebody... 15 new emotes.
[325:43.74]I've seen the hammer.
[325:46.42]I caught random live streams of this game years ago.
[325:50.94]I know the hammer exists and I know that it's available.
[325:57.06]I don't think I want to use it though.
[326:01.61]It is like a jokey Tom and Jerry hammer, I know.
[326:06.73]But is it worth it?
[326:08.33]Should I?
[326:08.63]I have been spoiled on the hammer, yes.
[326:16.79]I mean, I could get the cartoon hammer.
[326:28.74]But let's use these.
[326:33.17]Let's go through our collection of souls and use them all.
[326:41.04]It's a really good strength weapon.
[326:42.04]How much strength do you need to use it?
[326:44.81]And who the hell do I even talk to to do boss weapons?
[327:03.67]It's 39 strength, the two-handed.
[327:07.33]Go back to the giant.
[327:10.64]I'm just curious.
[327:11.52]Let me just look at it.
[327:12.76]Let me see.
[327:13.20]It might be fun.
[327:15.32]Where's Frant?
[327:18.30]Where's Mr. Frant?
[327:21.91]Over here, right?
[327:22.63]Somewhere in the water.
[327:26.01]There you are.
[327:29.45]I'm back.
[327:31.77]heavens you have done it you have retrieved the lord vessel after a thousand years it is you it is really you what if it is held on r2 right now
[327:52.99]Forgive me.
[327:54.41]I really should calm down.
[327:56.63]Now, let us take that vessel on a journey.
[328:00.52]I assume that you are ready.
[328:01.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[328:02.76]What's he doing?
[328:03.22]Now, be still.
[328:05.02]I'm not ready?
[328:05.46]Oh, God.
[328:07.00]I'm not ready for this.
[328:12.16]Is it eating me?
[328:14.62]What the fuck?
[328:18.45]Okay.
[328:21.07]That's different.
[328:29.84]Looks like a dog.
[328:30.54]Okay.
[328:33.92]When does the blood rush to his head?
[328:37.07]Where's his body?
[328:59.80]Okay, let's... Wait, don't I not want to do this?
[329:04.52]Because wouldn't... I mean, don't I need this to travel around?
[329:07.70]I'm not going to give this up, am I?
[329:18.69]Okay.
[329:28.01]I've been carrying that around the whole time.
[329:32.27]I don't believe that that would be possible.
[329:36.37]Why isn't that not a weapon?
[329:38.43]You hold it in two hands as a giant ball?
[329:57.86]You found the Lord Vessel.
[330:00.94]Now you can go into that magic pea door.
[330:03.22]Remember that one?
[330:03.90]Remember Chat made all those pea jokes?
[330:06.94]You can now go inside of them.
[330:10.50]All of them.
[330:11.10]These ones you didn't even see.
[330:12.45]Because you're not good enough at the game at this point.
[330:15.95]I can rest here.
[330:21.47]Wait, offer souls to the lord vessel?
[330:25.95]What does this do?
[330:29.51]I don't know.
[330:30.91]Okay, Frampt, I did it.
[330:36.03]As Kingseeker, I shall now instruct you, the Lord's successor, in your next task.
[330:43.18]To achieve your fate, fill the vessel with powerful souls, commensurate to the great soul of Gwyn.
[330:51.80]Scarce few possess such brilliant souls.
[330:55.53]Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, the four kings of New Londo, who inherited the shards of Gwyn's soul, and Lord Gwyn's former confidant, Seath the Scareless.
[331:12.25]All of their souls are required to satiate the Lord Vessel.
[331:16.95]Satiate, chat, and make sure you crack the orb.
[331:20.68]Then we shall return.
[331:22.64]Stay still for a moment.
[331:26.89]I tried.
[331:27.35]I got really close to the edge, too, and it's unfortunate.
[331:49.52]Okay, now, but I also want to feed you a bunch of stuff.
[331:51.90]I am pleased to see you well.
[331:54.06]Is it something urgent?
[331:57.93]feed let's feed him some of this trash uh let's I'm not gonna use the drake sword ever I mean all these I'm not gonna use any of these things some of these are cool I'm just gonna hit one soul value what are you talking about
[332:28.30]why I mean the whip these are all some of these are cool I just you know if they don't take up space it's not a big deal to keep some of the interesting ones there was a couple for like five thousand
[332:57.76]Dragontooth is 5,000.
[332:59.06]I'm not going to use it.
[333:08.77]Yeah, it's 5,000 souls.
[333:10.26]Just get rid of the damn thing.
[333:11.56]I'm never going to upgrade it.
[333:13.74]This is free money.
[333:28.95]What happened?
[333:32.61]What do you mean?
[333:33.29]What?
[333:33.89]What's the matter?
[333:36.46]No dra- Wait, wait.
[333:37.70]I... I sold the dragon tooth.
[333:43.00]Wait, you... It's not a big deal.
[333:45.44]It's just a tooth.
[333:47.25]It was a free item.
[333:49.93]I'm just getting rid of it.
[333:52.97]I don't want it anymore.
[333:56.49]Alright, let's go.
[333:56.97]I want to go before I end the stream.
[333:58.44]I do want to... Let's go to the... I need to go to Anolando.
[334:10.02]But it's a big tooth.
[334:10.90]Yeah, it's... I don't know.
[334:14.95]Alright, now... I need to go back to the giant.
[334:20.97]You can't get the items back?
[334:22.61]That's alright.
[334:23.07]I mean, I'm not going to use them.
[334:29.45]I have no intention of ever equipping that Dragontooth for any reason.
[334:39.64]I want to see you smogs, Hammer.
[334:45.11]How am I going to cosplay as Havel?
[334:47.77]You know, that's true.
[335:00.45]He's still here.
[335:02.63]What are you still doing here?
[335:04.11]I'm never gonna leave.
[335:08.77]I will always be here.
[335:11.95]I will always be in Anor Lando.
[335:15.16]Wait, isn't it up there?
[335:17.46]It is, isn't it?
[335:28.41]He's still there.
[335:40.91]Isn't it right here to the left?
[335:42.67]Is the gate that I opened, right?
[335:50.11]Yeah, it's right here.
[335:56.29]I just had to do that because, like, fuck that guy, you know what I mean?
[336:04.82]Come on, what?
[336:08.17]Just don't kick him.
[336:10.40]Hit him with your weapon.
[336:13.28]The thing that's equipped on your body.
[336:15.84]Right now.
[336:24.31]Strong.
[336:24.73]Okay.
[336:26.19]What do you got?
[336:29.73]He sells giant stuff.
[336:31.15]He sells actual giant stuff.
[336:35.88]This is the real giant stuff.
[336:38.86]Okay, what else do you got?
[336:39.80]Weaponsmith box.
[336:40.60]Tool used to etch Titanite into weapons for reinforcement.
[336:45.03]Repair box.
[336:48.03]Alright.
[336:49.75]Reinforced weapon.
[336:53.93]So I need two Dragon Scale.
[336:57.23]Good luck with that.
[337:00.61]But I need a club, people are saying.
[337:04.98]Does this count?
[337:09.46]Why did you... Okay.
[337:14.82]This takes white Titanite, so that's not really what I want.
[337:18.51]Does he sell a regular club?
[337:28.95]Divine club plus five.
[337:30.47]I don't know.
[337:41.78]So this turns it into a plus five.
[337:48.19]I need a plus ten weapon to be able to do that.
[337:52.01]So I need a club, and he doesn't sell one, right?
[337:56.31]No.
[337:58.68]I need to go to Andre.
[338:08.20]Downgrade to divine and then downgrade it again.
[338:10.33]Will that work?
[338:15.25]What does it take to do this?
[338:17.89]Nothing.
[338:26.14]This is now divine plus five.
[338:27.34]Now I can turn it into a club plus five.
[338:39.97]So it needs to be just a regular club.
[338:47.25]Go to bed.
[338:48.81]I will.
[338:49.13]I just wanted to see what this does.
[338:50.29]I just wanted to check it out.
[338:57.68]This is what I'm supposed to be doing, right?
[339:01.46]This is what I need to do, I think, right?
[339:04.14]I think so.
[339:04.64]That's what I'm going to do.
[339:10.00]Okay.
[339:15.52]Club plus 5.
[339:16.76]Where's club plus 5?
[339:21.08]Where did it go?
[339:27.77]Why is it not here?
[339:29.73]Do I have to go to Andre to get it to plus 10?
[339:33.95]Ah, fuck.
[339:39.44]Okay.
[339:40.80]Well, let's go!
[339:41.80]Only Andre can do it to plus 10.
[339:53.42]Okay.
[340:02.55]This is so lazy, but I'm gonna boom.
[340:14.88]Okay, so Chamber of the Princess, Darkwing, Daughter of Chaos, Depths, Undead Parish.
[340:20.83]What's the quickest way to get to Andre from here?
[340:24.75]The Depths?
[340:25.89]And turn around?
[340:26.69]I'm going to think it's the Depths and turn around.
[340:33.50]Either there or the Parish.
[340:35.22]I know the way to get there from the Parish.
[340:38.96]You're wasting time.
[340:41.04]Well, I mean, the stream's pretty much over anyways.
[340:44.14]Ah, okay, there we go.
[340:44.68]Yeah, he is right here.
[340:48.66]The stream ended right when I hit the jackpot.
[340:52.83]Okay.
[340:54.33]Let's talk.
[341:00.92]Alright.
[341:02.52]We need... But here's the thing.
[341:04.34]This is just getting this to be able to use Smog's Hammer, but I really want to upgrade this.
[341:10.96]Large Titanite shards.
[341:12.10]Let me just... Let me do this first.
[341:15.50]I want to get... Because I want to be able to use this thing.
[341:20.80]So, I'm going to do this first.
[341:37.51]So, plus six is all you can do here?
[341:44.77]We need the Great Club for Smog's Hammer.
[341:48.14]Is that for real?
[341:56.04]He doesn't even have it.
[341:59.19]How can I turn it into that?
[342:00.35]Club, Raw Club, Divine Club, Spear.
[342:04.91]The Normal Club will work too.
[342:17.32]So if I just get this to plus 10, this will work.
[342:20.54]Okay.
[342:24.74]So now how do I get this to plus 7?
[342:26.43]Now I have to... Okay, plus 7.
[342:33.91]This is confusing.
[342:42.32]I'm doing this... I can buy the shit.
[342:45.10]I told you guys I need to do this first.
[342:57.39]Okay.
[342:57.83]How many do I need to get this to 10?
[342:59.71]I wanted to get that to plus 10.
[343:06.42]Plus 10, butcher knife.
[343:10.40]Now, how much is it for titanites?
[343:13.98]The giant sells them.
[343:16.12]Oh, damn it.
[343:16.80]I got to go back and forth now.
[343:21.50]How many do I need for large titanites for this?
[343:24.30]Go get yourself killed, knight.
[343:27.92]Put that back on.
[343:33.00]Plus 10.
[343:34.00]There you are.
[343:34.48]180 plus 148.
[343:39.46]That's so much better.
[343:44.64]That's probably 30% more damage than it was before.
[343:48.99]Large Titanite's actually a major pain to get.
[344:03.11]Yeah, so here's what I'm gonna do.
[344:05.33]It is getting late.
[344:05.97]I don't know a lot of you guys are like still staying up late, late, late, late here.
[344:09.39]So we're gonna end now.
[344:13.01]Off stream before Saturday.
[344:14.49]We'll stream on Saturday too.
[344:16.53]I'm gonna just keep going.
[344:18.83]I'm going to just get some tight night and get these things ready to go and we'll go from there.
[344:27.32]Because it is like getting to be 1 o'clock in the morning and I know a lot of people are like trying to get to sleep.
[344:33.08]So, I will see you guys on Saturday.
[344:38.16]Thank you for bearing with my rage.
[344:41.46]Although, I wasn't getting mad necessarily at the game.
[344:44.96]There was one... There was a couple things.
[344:47.56]There was that fucking guy that was outside the door.
[344:50.59]Fuck that guy.
[344:51.99]Hate that guy.
[344:53.17]Hate this game.
[344:53.81]You know what I mean?
[344:56.67]But besides that, no, this... It's been... I was angry at, like... I wasn't even angry.
[345:01.69]I was just getting exhausted.
[345:02.57]I was getting tired.
[345:05.15]Rage is a natural part of Dark Souls.
[345:06.67]I know, but I just... I don't want you to think I'm some fucking psychopath.
[345:09.89]You know what I mean?
[345:12.91]Revising history.
[345:14.13]No.
[345:17.18]This is great.
[345:18.94]This is probably... Now that I can warp... Oh, man.
[345:23.16]I love it.
[345:26.46]I wasn't angry at the game.
[345:27.42]Fuck this game.
[345:28.14]I hate this game.
[345:30.37]No, but that was just me saying that to let some of the steam out of the teapot.
[345:34.47]You know what I mean?
[345:38.13]We got you a ring and you silenced us.
[345:42.24]Well, come on.
[345:42.70]Alright, let me... Before we go.
[345:45.08]Like... That's like I'm lying on... Imagine if I was lying in bed.
[345:50.22]And I'm watching a movie that I've never seen before.
[345:53.26]Okay?
[345:54.02]And the movie is... Attack of the... Attack of the Zombie Priests!
[346:00.17]I've never seen this movie, okay?
[346:02.07]And I'm like, oh, I've never seen this movie.
[346:03.17]I want to experience this movie.
[346:04.29]Cool, I've heard it was really good.
[346:05.61]I heard it was a fantastic movie.
[346:07.27]And there is a cult of people that love this movie, right?
[346:10.61]One of the best movies ever made, considered by a lot of people.
[346:13.77]I announce on Twitter that I'm going to watch Attack of the Zombie Priests.
[346:20.36]Invasion of the zombie priests and everyone's like oh wow he's gonna be he's gonna watch that movie I love that movie and I'm sitting there on my couch watching and All of a sudden right before a major moment happens, you know right before the zombie priests invade and there's a big twist People just people just start knocking on my windows screaming and
[346:42.19]Hey, the priest is actually the bad guy.
[346:44.87]The priest is the bad guy the whole movie.
[346:46.75]And I'm just like, what are the people saying out there?
[346:48.19]I'm trying to watch a movie here.
[346:49.55]Hey, the priest is the bad guy.
[346:51.25]No, hey, watch.
[346:52.11]Watch right now.
[346:52.69]The priest is an asshole.
[346:53.53]He's a bad guy.
[346:54.21]And I'm just like, what?
[346:56.18]The priest is a bad guy?
[346:57.72]Yeah, the priest is a bad guy.
[346:58.86]The priest is a bad guy.
[347:01.48]And then the priest shows up and he's standing like 10 seconds later, the priest gets out of the fucking alien spaceship and you're like, holy fuck, it was the priest up there the whole time.
[347:10.97]That was the cracked orb bit right there.
[347:23.45]Spoilers, I was gonna watch that.
[347:31.07]And it's not even just one person.
[347:32.59]We're talking about, imagine like a hundred people at every window in your house, all banging at the same time, all screaming, the priest is a bad guy.
[347:42.70]I like have to change around my head.
[347:43.96]I'm just like what the fuck is happening here?
[347:52.16]Just don't look at chat no, but I want to look at chat cuz I think that the things you guys say are fucking funny and I like seeing what you guys are saying and I like getting tips and Extra strategies and hey go touch the fireplace.
[348:06.24]I'm okay with that.
[348:06.92]This is this game's 2011 It's alright
[348:14.98]But just stay away from my goddamn windows.
[348:28.57]Like, the part I get baited into the painting.
[348:31.60]That's fine, though.
[348:32.70]That's fun.
[348:33.34]Like, I didn't even get to go down the stairs.
[348:40.80]To see the message on my screen that says, hey, the cracked orb is glowing.
[348:45.10]I looked over and I just see... Cracked orb, cracked orb, cracked orb, and I'm just like... What?
[348:50.80]What do I need?
[348:51.28]What?
[348:52.04]And then, like, the movie shows up on my screen.
[348:54.57]I'm, like, watching the movie in, like, a 15 second chat.
[348:57.09]I have, like, a chat... Forwarding here.
[349:00.65]You guys are telling me the movie as the movie's about to play.
[349:08.29]But regardless...
[349:16.56]use the zombie priest that's gonna be it I said I was gonna end the stream an hour ago and then I put another hundred dollars in the machine and I beat Ornstein and Smough just admit that you hate us why would I do that when it's just not true
[349:43.72]There's a few spoilers every now and then.
[349:45.22]It's minor things.
[349:45.96]That's not the problem.
[349:46.74]The problem is when hundreds of people are screaming at him to do something, it pressures him to do it immediately and stops him from playing the way he's going to play.
[349:54.98]Especially when it's something he can figure out on his own, like the orb.
[349:58.38]I started panicking.
[350:00.08]I thought I did something wrong.
[350:08.38]But the priest, he was a bad guy.
[350:14.61]No, at the end of the day, I really don't, like, care.
[350:16.55]I mean, we're having a 15-minute conversation at the end of the stream about it.
[350:22.61]But... I know, I, I, I, I, like, understand.
[350:27.49]I know, I, I, I really do.
[350:30.46]And I know a lot of you guys just jump on it and are just like, fucking Orb, Orb, Orb!
[350:33.74]And then I died to Ornstein Smog, like, five times.
[350:47.02]And I know you wanted me to get the good ring, and it helped a lot.
[350:50.92]And thanks, because I may not have done it.
[350:53.38]I don't know.
[350:55.66]But here come the credits.
[350:56.36]Thanks to all the new subs, all the resubs.
[350:59.26]You guys rock.
[351:04.52]Five times is pretty good.
[351:07.22]I don't even know what it was.
[351:09.86]It was either four, five, or six.
[351:11.68]Maybe one more.
[351:12.24]I don't know.
[351:13.76]You were just trying to help me.
[351:14.77]I know.
[351:15.11]And I really do appreciate it.
[351:16.63]I do.
[351:17.67]Because these games are fucking hard and confusing.
[351:19.47]Especially this one.
[351:25.93]It was six times.
[351:30.13]Well, at least it wasn't the Crystal Sage.
[351:31.67]I died to the Crystal Sage 15 times.
[351:36.95]Do you remember that?
[351:39.26]Were you guys here?
[351:40.36]How many of you guys were here for the Crystal Sage meltdown?
[351:46.10]I wonder.
[351:53.70]You there?
[351:59.07]Crystal Sage is bullshit?
[352:01.21]Oh, it was... That was a real meltdown, though.
[352:03.95]One of the worst.
[352:07.68]Dark Souls 3.
[352:17.95]I'm fucking ending the stream if I see the orb again.
[352:21.27]And everybody just fucking starts spamming it.
[352:28.14]It's so funny.
[352:28.70]What would happen?
[352:30.83]What if I just did turn off the stream right there?
[352:33.57]What would have happened?
[352:34.23]I mean, it'd be like, oh, fuck.
[352:35.57]It worked.
[352:37.11]It worked.
[352:45.57]Anyways, thank you, everybody, for your subscriptions, all the resubs, and the new subs.

[355:40.44]I don't want to give you any ideas.
[355:43.90]But thank you guys.
[355:44.46]That was a lot of subscriptions.
[355:46.72]You guys rock.
[355:47.20]Thank you so much.
[355:49.15]And now, let's do the bits.
[355:52.53]And I'm going to do these bits very, very, very fast.
[355:55.99]And I'm not kidding.
[355:57.43]I'm not kidding when I say super fast.
[356:01.45]Are you ready?
[356:02.91]I'm ready.
[356:04.53]Let's get it started here.
[356:06.27]If you're leaving, if you're taking off, see you on Saturday.
[356:09.09]Saturday, probably late afternoon.
[356:12.94]Just, the sus command will probably just be at 7.
[356:15.90]But I'm going to try to start a couple hours before that.
[356:17.62]But just 7, just 7, before 7 at some point.
[356:23.94]Here we go.
[356:24.44]Lightning fast.
[356:26.46]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.50.
[356:28.72]What's my opinion on the Squatty Potty?
[356:31.98]Uh... I bought one since I've been having flare-ups lately.
[356:34.42]It comes tomorrow.
[356:35.12]Before, I used an upside-down bucket, but then I crushed it while on the loo.
[356:39.85]What?
[356:40.15]A Squatty Potty?
[356:41.11]I don't know what that is.
[356:45.31]Squatty Potty.
[356:48.35]I have no opinion.
[356:48.99]I can't give it to you.
[356:49.61]Sorry, man.
[356:50.57]Hopefully it works.
[356:53.58]Thank you, Miracy, for the 250.
[356:54.47]You're gonna read this after you've had many an aneurysm due to Dark Soul, uh, juiced.
[357:00.31]Just watch.
[357:02.39]That's true.
[357:02.77]Yeah.
[357:03.83]That was six hours ago.
[357:06.17]I mean, I did have a slight... I did, um... Would you guys classify the Ornstein and Smough whole thing as an aneurysm or a meltdown?
[357:12.98]I don't think I would.
[357:14.38]I think I was getting... I was just accepting how much I was losing.
[357:17.06]I wasn't getting actually that angry, was I?
[357:19.24]I don't remember.
[357:19.66]I was in a blind rage.
[357:21.88]I don't remember.
[357:28.12]I was more sad than I was angry I think.
[357:44.53]You did hate the game.
[357:45.81]I was so angry I don't remember.
[358:01.89]You know, I'm gonna tell you just a little insight here.
[358:04.51]You wanna know when I'm really actually angry?
[358:08.44]When my voice drops down like this, and I'm just like, it's fucking stupid.
[358:13.86]It's like, this is not even fucking fun.
[358:17.30]When I get like down to like that lower tone, that's how you know, oh man, this is not good.
[358:24.89]It's just like fucking stupid and I can't even fucking do it.
[358:27.11]I'm just not having any fucking fun.
[358:29.79]Like, what the fuck?
[358:30.59]Whoa!
[358:31.35]I can't believe I died!
[358:32.51]That's not, like, that's like just kind of excitement and a little bit of anger.
[358:36.35]But... No, this ain't fucking cool.
[358:38.55]I'm not having a fucking fun time.
[358:39.55]This is stupid.
[358:42.12]That's like, I'm actually upset when I start talking like that.
[358:48.64]Pretty much, go back and cross-reference every time I've talked about Microsoft or Comcast.
[358:53.50]That's how you can tell that's real deep-seated, like, meltdown coming up.
[359:00.95]That's how you sounded playing Kahoot.
[359:09.93]We like watching you win and lose.
[359:11.35]I know!
[359:11.85]It's part of the process.
[359:13.94]That's why I wasn't trying to get too upset at it.
[359:16.66]I was just casino sad.
[359:17.96]That was a good fight though.
[359:26.85]That fight is very hard.
[359:30.66]But I wasn't really... Nothing really... Everything seemed like it was possible to get away from.
[359:37.31]You can get screwed a few times, like the very beginning.
[359:42.59]That was... That was tough.
[359:44.81]It's tough.
[359:48.29]Lightning fast!
[359:50.03]We've done two.
[359:52.42]Hey, thank you Gabe DeGrossi for the five dollars.
[359:54.06]Jerma, it's an inspiration to join.
[359:55.46]A stroke of luck to have you around.
[359:56.92]To have a content creator like yourself.
[359:58.99]True to his roots and brilliant to his community.
[360:01.65]Honestly, a privilege, man.
[360:02.73]Hopefully your Wi-Fi is chill tonight.
[360:04.21]Thank you.
[360:05.47]Thank you, Gabe DeGrossi, for the five dollars.
[360:07.31]And yes, if you weren't here earlier, if you were here, you know, during like that, I did threaten chat with me turning the stream off because I was so angry with them.
[360:15.70]So, like, I'm so good to this community.
[360:18.42]Look at how good I am to you guys.
[360:21.11]I just threatened you with one Twitch stream turn off midstream.
[360:30.87]But thank you, for real.
[360:31.71]It means a lot.
[360:34.85]Hey, Shrewberry, thanks for the dollar.
[360:35.98]Hey, Jeremy, you're cool.
[360:36.70]Thanks a lot, man.
[360:37.36]Thank you, Shabalabadingdon, for the one dollar.
[360:40.80]Bribe Comcast with this.
[360:43.28]I think they need a little bit more than a dollar.
[360:45.40]But you'll be giving that.
[360:46.50]It's okay.
[360:46.94]You don't have to give me more than a dollar.
[360:48.48]Thank you.
[360:51.55]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for the $1.
[360:53.85]It's a screenshot here.
[360:54.69]Well, well, well, fancy meeting you here, squirmy Jerm.
[360:57.33]I've almost got my $50 badge, JJ the Jet Plane, which is impressive considering $35 of those dollars are made up of quarters.
[361:03.18]But enough about me, let's get down to brass tacks.
[361:05.98]I know you don't like singing on camera, but what cartoon theme song really stuck with you?
[361:10.12]Thanks for all the laughs, and enjoy the comic.
[361:13.04]Now, here's a comic.
[361:13.78]My favorite is the original Spider-Man theme song.
[361:18.55]The one that goes... The guy... Like the Bon Jovi guy has the thing like that... And he's like, Spider-Blood, Spider-Blood.
[361:25.85]Radioactive Spider-Blood.
[361:28.45]That's the best one by far.
[361:31.08]Man, Jerma's streaming today.
[361:32.06]I'm not really feeling up to typing another Garfagraph though.
[361:37.18]Tragic.
[361:37.78]Poor guy's only on his first Garfagraph and he's already hit writer's block.
[361:41.14]Why are you making these?
[361:46.71]Why are you making these?
[361:50.71]This takes effort and time, and... Thank you, though, Garfield.
[361:57.30]Thank you, BonelessBacon, for the $1.
[361:58.92]I see your internet's doing better than yesterday.
[362:00.36]Good to see that.
[362:02.02]Still hoping for more interactive streams with things like Kahoot.
[362:06.36]Yeah, the new Jackbox came out last year, like, not that long ago or so.
[362:11.65]I was gonna do that.
[362:13.21]Still plan on it, but...
[362:15.26]No, that was fun.
[362:16.70]Thank you, dude.
[362:18.44]Glad we had internet today.
[362:19.96]Again, this is like the erratic nonsense that is this fucking company Comcast.
[362:24.54]Seven hours stream two days ago.
[362:27.71]Two hours stream yesterday because the internet doesn't work.
[362:30.43]Six hours stream tonight.
[362:32.21]Perfect.
[362:33.19]Not one drop frame.
[362:34.89]It just doesn't make any sense.
[362:36.72]There's no rhyme or reason to any of it.
[362:41.26]But thank you.
[362:42.90]Thank you, Luke.
[362:43.42]Warm soda can for the $1.
[362:45.26]I've spent like four hours farming for the Balder Swag Sword, you fucker.
[362:48.48]I got it first try, man.
[362:52.81]That's just what happens when you go to the casino.
[362:55.63]Real freaking funny.
[362:56.43]Thanks for the dollar.
[362:57.01]Good luck with the move to Vegas.
[362:58.01]Just make sure you don't gamble too much.
[363:00.83]I agree with you, but as you saw at the end of the stream here, gambling sometimes works.
[363:05.42]For some people, sometimes.
[363:07.50]Not all the time.
[363:09.79]Clever cactus, thanks for the dollar.
[363:11.01]What's the scariest kind of bee?
[363:12.46]A booby.
[363:14.68]That was a, uh, that was a sexual, uh, sexually charged joke there.
[363:19.76]Thank you, Mighty Waffle, for the one dollar.
[363:21.22]Jerma, last night you said jermaSaturn wasn't cool because it isn't big, cold, or gassy.
[363:25.83]Saturn is the second largest planet right after Jerma Jupiter.
[363:29.59]Saturn's temperature is over 170 degrees Celsius negative, and Saturn is made almost entirely out of hydrogen and helium.
[363:36.15]What do you have to say now, Jerma?
[363:38.21]Saturn just exists.
[363:39.23]985.
[363:39.35]It's still the worst planet.
[363:48.24]The planet ain't even red.
[363:49.62]Get the fuck out of here.
[363:51.74]You know what I mean?
[363:52.22]Like, get that fucking thing out of here.
[363:53.80]De-planetize it.
[363:55.24]It ain't even red or blue.
[363:56.97]They're not even cool looking.
[363:59.17]It's not huge.
[364:03.85]Thank you, Bone Jackal, for the one dollar.
[364:06.49]He says, snap, haha.
[364:10.15]T-Taurus, yep.
[364:12.29]This one's going in my cringe compilation.
[364:20.14]Whatever the fuck that... I don't know what I did, but whatever.
[364:23.09]Alright.
[364:25.61]Thank you, wonderful telephone, for the $1.
[364:27.59]This absolute unit with his little fucking blue legs, I can't handle it.
[364:31.95]Bumblebee.
[364:34.21]Eternally Gaming, thanks for the $1.
[364:35.47]Hey, Jeremiah, I work with computers and help another popular streamer with his computer stuff.
[364:39.51]If you ever want me to help you, feel free to get in contact.
[364:42.15]My PMs are open.
[364:44.14]Well, first of all, thank you for putting me in a category of popular streamers.
[364:49.12]I just got called a popular streamer, guys.
[364:52.92]By the way, it's been a few weeks.
[364:55.52]Where are we on the list?
[365:00.52]Am I over 900?
[365:01.50]Am I in the low nines now?
[365:05.50]Did I lose a place or gain a place in the top 1,000?
[365:17.58]Did I get knocked out?
[365:22.68]I'm off the list because of Comcast.
[365:24.14]$953?
[365:24.16]What was I?
[365:25.32]$970 something?
[365:25.86]$980?
[365:29.80]We're doing alright.
[365:30.53]What is this list?
[365:31.03]Top 1000 Twitch streamers.
[365:32.77]I'm there.
[365:50.20]But thanks a lot, man.
[365:52.96]Yeah, if I... Every time I have computer issues, I'm always looking for people, so... Appreciate the offer.
[366:06.17]I'm gonna just burn this thing to the ground.
[366:08.51]It says I got a B+.
[366:10.35]I'm alright with that.
[366:12.01]I don't want an A+.
[366:12.99]People would expect too much out of you.
[366:16.51]B to B plus is like, alright.
[366:19.45]I don't expect much, but it's pretty good.
[366:22.37]Right?
[366:23.03]It's good enough.
[366:26.07]Thank you, CairoToby, again earlier for $50.
[366:28.83]Thank you so much, CairoToby.
[366:32.21]HeavyIt, thanks for the $1.
[366:33.19]Glad your internet's good enough to stream today.
[366:34.87]Thank you, HeavyIt.
[366:36.27]Me too.
[366:37.52]For sure, me too.
[366:38.74]Sorry to hear about that, but it is great that you put at least three or four channel references in there.
[367:02.75]Oh, it was through my mouth.
[367:04.27]Not kidding.
[367:04.75]I'm not even kidding.
[367:05.33]It really did happen.
[367:05.93]Not even kidding.
[367:07.31]Not even kidding.
[367:08.11]I'm not even kidding.
[367:09.69]Do I say that too much?
[367:11.23]Like, of course I'm not kidding when I say... Actually, I might be kidding, though.
[367:15.12]Not even kidding.
[367:15.74]Like, guys, I'm not even kidding.
[367:17.56]I'm dead serious.
[367:18.78]I'm dead serious.
[367:19.74]Not even kidding.
[367:21.68]That's one of my filler lines that I say all the time.
[367:26.86]But happy birthday, man.
[367:27.72]Sorry, the clown didn't come.
[367:38.03]I do say it a lot, not even kidding.
[367:41.18]I tell you, not even kidding.
[367:46.52]Check out VTTV.
[367:48.86]Yeah, I've heard you use it.
[367:52.87]Your whole performance is a joke.
[367:54.37]Of course you need to say you're not kidding.
[367:55.89]I don't know if that's a compliment or if that's an insult.
[368:00.65]Either way, I mean, maybe.
[368:07.11]But, thank you, Casey.
[368:08.21]Happy birthday again.
[368:11.05]Thank you, too.
[368:12.70]Almost got me a couple of times here.
[368:15.82]Almost got me.
[368:17.18]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[368:18.36]Why does Silver Penne look like the Michelin Man?
[368:20.50]Because he's got the Sigward gear on and he looks like the Marshmallow Dude.
[368:28.68]McMully, thanks for the $5.
[368:29.56]Hey, Jerma, in five minutes, make sure you're not in a boss fight.
[368:33.12]It didn't happen.
[368:33.78]It didn't pop up at all.
[368:35.00]I clicked wait an hour.
[368:37.85]And five hours went by and it's still not there.
[368:43.39]I don't know why, but thank you for the reminder.
[368:45.92]Imagine if you had that kind of power.
[369:04.99]Even I forgot about that?
[369:06.05]Yeah, I did.
[369:06.59]And did we?
[369:07.57]Everyone forgot about that.
[369:09.49]Imagine that popped up in the end of that Ornstein and Smough fight.
[369:14.16]I... Honestly, that was good.
[369:15.96]That fight went so well, I really probably would have put my foot through my computer.
[369:24.92]And I would have, like, called up some PC company and been like, Give me a new computer for sponsorship!
[369:30.08]I'll say your name.
[369:31.53]Once.
[369:32.55]And then hang up.
[369:35.73]Yes, this is a Super Master PC.
[369:37.99]How can I help you?
[369:39.03]Yeah, I'm a top 1,000 Twitch streamer, and I want to do a computer sponsorship, maybe, and I have a lot of viewers.
[369:48.42]Oh, okay, cool.
[369:49.64]That sounds like an interesting idea.
[369:51.32]We'll soup you up with an 8-core hydro-liquid-quieted-cooled computer.
[369:55.68]That sounds good.
[369:56.98]And I'm going to say your name once only.
[369:58.94]Okay, man.
[370:01.94]That sounds great.
[370:02.60]Thanks, bye.
[370:05.28]It'll be easy.
[370:10.76]But thank you, Captain Morgan.
[370:16.19]How the fuck did somebody make that name that fast?
[370:21.87]Are they here?
[370:23.57]I didn't just say somebody's name, did I?
[370:28.63]Super Master PC?
[370:29.69]Did somebody in here named that?
[370:37.74]Whatever.
[370:39.36]That's... Oh, he's just... Okay, he's just fucking wrong.
[370:42.54]I get you.
[370:44.55]I was like, holy shit, that was quick.
[370:46.59]That's bot level quick.
[370:49.01]But thank you, Captain Morgan, for the $1.50.
[370:50.43]You need to show them that they mess with gamers, Jerma.
[370:52.49]Gamers.
[370:54.04]The great gamer prophecy foretells that if you beat Dark Souls on stream with under 100 deaths, all Veronica's will leave their chads for gamer gentlemen.
[371:04.41]Please hurry, Jeremiah.
[371:05.23]I'm a nice guy who needs... Well, I already died over 100 times, so that doesn't... It's over.
[371:12.45]That's not gonna happen.
[371:13.50]Prophecy failed.
[371:17.02]Thank you, Sir Phelan, for the $1.
[371:19.40]Welcome to the bone zone.
[371:22.98]I was there.
[371:26.86]Sir Feline, thanks for the one dollar.
[371:28.00]Jeremy, you can't kill your only furry friend.
[371:32.18]Thanks again for the one dollar, Sir Feline.
[371:33.96]The madman did it.
[371:36.49]That invisible fight made no sense.
[371:39.05]I'm sure there's a reason why that happened, but, you know, whatever.
[371:43.75]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the one dollar.
[371:45.29]First you call androids not people, then you call scalies scalios, then you call snakemen not people, then you hurt the cat lady.
[371:53.02]I'm a xenophobe.
[372:05.35]Androids are robots.
[372:07.85]Scales... Scalios are snakes.
[372:11.32]Snake men are not a person.
[372:13.58]It's a snake standing up on two feet.
[372:18.60]And I did... Yes, the one thing you got me on here is I did swing an axe at the cat lady.
[372:24.04]I did.
[372:25.92]The other shit, come on.
[372:34.75]It's a lizard.
[372:36.51]It's an iguana.
[372:39.46]Yes, I'm sorry.
[372:40.36]Iguanas are not people.
[372:43.44]They are iguanas.
[372:45.08]They are iguanai.
[372:47.38]An iguana is not a human.
[372:49.26]It's an iguanai.
[372:58.11]Okay, the dragon lady is... It could be a person that had some weird DNA that went in there.
[373:08.10]She's a dragon lady, whatever she is.
[373:09.84]An iguana is a lizard.
[373:19.23]Okay, I'm gonna type in, Google right now.
[373:26.66]What is people?
[373:28.66]What is people?
[373:32.30]People, human beings in general or considered collectively.
[373:39.08]human beings in general, or considered collectively.
[373:45.06]This does not say people, human beings, and also iguanas in general, human beings and also dragons in general,
[374:06.73]A person is a humanoid with free will.
[374:09.81]A fucking lizard is not a fucking human.
[374:16.46]Iguanas are humans.
[374:19.24]Oh my god, you guys are just being a couple of humans right now.
[374:27.05]Did you just complain that the definition of the word people didn't include the term people?
[374:31.63]No, I'm saying that the term people does not include...
[374:36.13]lizards If lizards aren't people then what are lizard people?
[374:50.31]Something Tolkien came up with a hundred years ago That's what a lizard person is Some old guy had an imagination a hundred and fifty years ago.
[375:01.59]That's what a lizard person is
[375:12.99]Checkmate.
[375:23.36]Imagination isn't... No, alright, I'm moving on.
[375:26.08]I'm moving on.
[375:27.82]You find me... You find me a fucking lizard person.
[375:30.84]And I will retract that statement.
[375:34.07]Newsflash to me.
[375:36.25]Have you ever seen my eyes?
[375:37.79]They go like...
[375:41.37]I'm just really trying to detract and, like, throw you guys off big time here.
[375:45.61]Watch my eyes next time.
[375:46.71]Watch my eyes.
[375:47.19]Oh, God.
[375:57.55]Okay, I gotta go.
[375:58.17]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[376:00.07]The Madman did it.
[376:00.73]Sticks Renegade, thank you for the $1.
[376:02.37]Lukewarm, Soda Can, thanks for the $1.
[376:04.11]Turn on sub only.
[376:06.77]I must have been having a meltdown.
[376:09.04]Thank you Snooze and Copter for the $1.
[376:10.50]I actually enjoy chat being so torn.
[376:12.72]It really gives you the original Dark Souls experience because you can see all these crazy messages offline.
[376:17.87]But chat replaces those.
[376:20.63]That's actually really true.
[376:23.77]That's a hell of a statement.
[376:25.65]You guys are the notes on the ground.
[376:33.18]That's such a perfect way to put that.
[376:40.11]Thank you, dude.
[376:40.87]Thank you, lukewarm soda can for the one dollar.
[376:42.81]You killed fluffy tail waifu, you monster.
[376:47.34]I need to find out why that makes me a monster later on in the game when Gwyn yells at me when I go into his Gwyn room.
[376:55.00]Thank you to Ajajaja for the two bucks.
[376:57.42]Rest in feets.
[376:59.54]Rest in feets.
[377:01.34]Oh yeah, when I killed the lady.
[377:02.34]I'm sorry.
[377:03.42]OG Jeffed her thanks for the ten bucks.
[377:04.72]You murdered Nicole Blood.
[377:06.76]Jerma, she was going to let you go, but you killed her.
[377:10.57]That's because I wanted her stuff.
[377:13.67]So... I wanted her... I wanted to get the free head and the free helmet.
[377:21.20]The helmet you guys were... telling me to get.
[377:25.32]The... The spoon head.
[377:38.47]The spoon helmet.
[377:48.79]Thank you to OG Jeff Tor for the 10 bucks.
[377:51.75]Appreciate it.
[377:54.21]You're not even using it because it takes up so much of the screen.
[377:56.59]Do you see how much real estate that takes up?
[378:00.27]That's a negative.
[378:02.94]That makes the game harder.
[378:10.68]I should just turn on... I really might just try to do this for like an hour on Saturday.
[378:16.88]Turn on the...
[378:19.91]The thing where you can click on the screen.
[378:22.29]And you guys can guide me for the first hour of the game.
[378:29.76]You know that extension?
[378:30.86]Twitch extensions?
[378:31.62]I feel like they would give you some fun stuff to do here.
[378:37.62]Maybe we'll try that on Saturday.
[378:39.21]But thank you.
[378:39.79]Acknowledge John for the $1.
[378:41.75]Please use your Dark Souls character Fat Man Mr. Upskirt Arm Clipping Stein for Jerma Rumble 2019.
[378:47.10]Thank you.
[378:50.54]Thank you.
[378:50.90]And Adam for the $1.
[378:51.80]Wear the drumstick hat or I unsubscribe.
[378:54.10]I'm sorry.
[378:54.64]I had to take it off.
[378:56.04]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[378:57.18]I literally cried out in anguish when Jerma said he was going to do backwards through sends to upgrade his weapon.
[379:07.86]I didn't know there was another guy.
[379:12.10]Again, I haven't seen this movie.
[379:15.32]I didn't see the part where the giant is at the bottom of those stairs.
[379:20.17]I can see your breath on my window.
[379:21.95]Your face is pressed up and you're... I didn't know it existed.
[379:32.29]Thank you, though.
[379:33.61]Thank you, NoControl, for the $1.
[379:34.87]They just said cheer.
[379:35.81]Thanks, man.
[379:36.21]Thank you, Hydra, for the $1.
[379:38.50]Hey, just want to thank you for playing one of my favorite games.
[379:42.14]I know that chat is trying to mess you up, but I want to let you know that you have not eaten any bad raspberries and you're doing just great.
[379:48.26]Keep it up, champ.
[379:50.71]Thank you, Hydra.
[379:51.65]I can see why this is one of your favorite games for sure.
[379:57.65]It is a good one.
[380:00.27]It is very good.
[380:03.47]I'm just sad that I'm probably halfway through the game.
[380:06.45]What would you guys say at this point?
[380:09.59]Is this like the 50%, 40, 50% mark here?
[380:12.63]Am I like at the halfway point after getting the Lord Vessel?
[380:18.77]Or is it more than that?
[380:22.05]If we're talking about including DLC.
[380:27.68]It's a bit over 50%.
[380:28.28]60-ish.
[380:28.48]That's cool.
[380:35.66]I'm glad.
[380:36.26]I love it, man.
[380:37.22]I'm having a great time.
[380:41.08]But thank you, Hydra.
[380:43.06]Thank you, Kelidinus for the 10 bucks.
[380:47.20]If you head back to where you entered Anor Londo at the top of the sunlight lift, there's a gargoyle who will carry you back to Sen's Fortress.
[380:57.38]40 with a DLC?
[381:00.24]That's good.
[381:01.14]Because I want to beat the whole thing.
[381:07.48]I am immensely enjoying this game.
[381:16.79]Oinstein and Smog are the final boss.
[381:20.46]So where... Okay, hold on.
[381:21.34]Before we keep going.
[381:23.20]Where are those two in regards to fight difficulty in the game?
[381:31.06]Are they somewhere in like the top five, top ten?
[381:33.42]Where would those guys sit in boss difficulty for this game?
[381:43.02]Top five?
[381:46.32]Really?
[381:46.62]They're like the third or second hardest in the game.
[381:52.36]Holy shit.
[381:52.84]They're some of the hardest bosses in Souls, period.
[382:01.68]They're the hardest without being total bullshit.
[382:03.44]But that's the thing, right?
[382:04.96]Like I mentioned before.
[382:05.78]That fight sucks, but it's not... You can see how you're dying.
[382:17.27]I am very tired.
[382:18.58]Yes, I am very tired.
[382:21.80]That's cool.
[382:26.66]Alright, I was just curious because that was pretty rough.
[382:35.03]Considering I struggled with Crystal Sage in First Try Dancer, I don't even know.
[382:38.29]I don't know, I guess.
[382:44.66]Alright, speed reading.
[382:47.14]Thank you to Casey for the $1.
[382:49.14]Are you still planning on changing the subsound to Tim Allen?
[382:52.34]Yeah.
[382:54.60]Buy Saturday or I'll delete my Twitch channel.
[382:59.36]Thank you Mystic Slay for the $10.
[383:01.51]Is this streamer still at Anor Londo?
[383:04.90]Yes.
[383:06.12]Technically, yes.
[383:07.76]Thank you for the ten bucks, dude.
[383:09.76]Bro, look, thanks for the one dollar.
[383:11.00]He's going insane.
[383:12.66]Let's see how, why.
[383:13.60]Fuck you.
[383:14.00]What is this?
[383:14.42]What?
[383:14.54]What am I doing?
[383:15.24]What am I talking about?
[383:18.58]Fuck you.
[383:18.84]You guys suck.
[383:35.35]Oh, I'm talking about the dumb gargoyle brain.
[383:38.07]Okay.
[383:39.99]For a second, I'm like, what the fuck am I talking about?
[383:44.61]But, thank you.
[383:45.67]Yes, I am going insane.
[383:47.93]Thank you, Stix.
[383:48.45]Renegade for the $1.
[383:49.79]I always love it when you beatbox like that.
[383:51.48]My favorite one is still the Meet the Sniper theme you did when you streamed Sniper Elite 4.
[383:58.46]That's an easy one to do, though.
[384:02.56]You want a link?
[384:04.16]Here's the link.
[384:09.79]Thank you, though.
[384:10.29]Thank you, TwoSticks.
[384:11.21]Thank you, Frexter, for the five bucks.
[384:12.60]Good night and good morning from when I watched the VOD.
[384:15.76]Loving the Dark Souls streams.
[384:18.12]Well, Frexter, you're probably going to... I just want to apologize for that meltdown you just watched an hour ago.
[384:24.08]It was embarrassing, and I apologize.
[384:26.31]I apologize for that meltdown.
[384:28.53]Okay.
[384:31.81]But good night and good morning, Frexter.
[384:34.66]Yeah.
[384:34.88]I really do need another Fire Soul, though.
[384:35.98]It's like... I was told that I should have at least two or three by now.
[384:38.00]I'm really starting to feel that.
[384:39.22]Especially with a health bar this big.
[385:09.22]Needing to drink two full chugs to get even remotely a significant portion of my health bar.
[385:14.19]That sucks.
[385:18.33]Whoa, what's going on here?
[385:19.01]We're deleting people?
[385:20.11]What's happening?
[385:22.58]Oh my god, what's happening?
[385:28.22]I think I missed something.
[385:29.06]Something just went down in the chat I just missed.
[385:35.89]There's apparently one in Blighttown.
[385:37.03]I'm...
[385:38.97]Maybe on Saturday before we keep going, I'll stick around and blow.
[385:41.89]Maybe I'll just do it off-stream.
[385:44.05]I might off-stream just go back to Blighttown and just pick up the soul.
[385:51.58]Don't worry about it.
[385:52.22]It's over.
[385:52.84]Oh.
[385:54.70]Somebody was being bad.
[385:56.52]Oh.
[385:59.74]But don't be bad.
[386:00.32]Come on, man.
[386:01.99]We're just hanging out here, man.
[386:07.97]Okay, so...
[386:10.42]Thank you, Lukewarm.
[386:12.50]Thank you, PrimeVino, for the $1.7 bits to help you get the best Razer gaming optical internet west of the Mississippi.
[386:18.54]Hope it goes well on the move.
[386:19.42]Thanks, man.
[386:22.32]There's another clip here.
[386:27.37]Yeah, this is a dragon comes over and goes...
[386:32.70]I mean, I knew it was going to happen, obviously, because there's a bridge in every Dark Souls game that a dragon flies by and breathes fire on.
[386:41.76]And plus, I've seen that before, but I didn't, you know, obviously.
[386:45.06]That was pretty good timing.
[386:50.32]But thank you, Prime Video, and thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[386:54.35]This guy is seriously going to go insane soon, calling it now.
[386:57.95]Here's another one from right after that.
[387:03.20]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[387:04.60]Also, Jeremy, you said there'd be new subsounds or you would delete your Twitch channel.
[387:08.23]What's your channel still doing?
[387:09.29]A lot.
[387:10.01]Then there's my Ethereum address.
[387:11.89]Alright.
[387:13.07]Thank you, Tel Naga, for the $1.55.
[387:17.37]I promise these are ad-generated.
[387:20.42]I'm somewhere new and better thanks to a lot of good people and I'm working on medical stuff.
[387:25.20]Thank you, love you, Terps.
[387:26.50]Thank you, Tel.
[387:29.18]Good to hear that you're doing better.
[387:31.56]Good to hear that you are doing better.
[387:37.67]Take care of yourself.
[387:44.15]Glad to see you here.
[387:51.73]Power star?
[387:52.51]What's this?
[387:53.65]Are there any more of those balls?
[387:56.07]I feel like one's going to come crashing through the wall here or something downstairs.
[387:59.04]I keep hearing it.
[387:59.66]I keep hearing the noise.
[388:00.52]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[388:08.41]Okay, I just did... Super Mario got a star.
[388:12.15]I did?
[388:12.45]Wow, that's true.
[388:16.01]I've told you... We've talked about this before, but you guys realize I don't remember anything I've ever said, right?
[388:24.04]It's fine.
[388:24.54]People will link me clips of shit that I don't even... It's new to me.
[388:30.58]I'm like, wow, okay, cool, yeah, man.
[388:34.66]Like, I've never heard that before in my life.
[388:42.32]Thank you, The Past, again, for 100 bucks.
[388:44.00]Thanks a lot, man.
[388:46.32]We touched upon it earlier, but... Thank you so much for that.
[388:52.36]Much appreciated.
[388:54.52]Lukewarm Soda Can, thanks for the dollar.
[388:55.94]It was real money.
[388:58.08]It was real money.
[389:00.84]Real money.
[389:02.84]Thank you, dude.
[389:03.32]Thank you, Sir Phelan, for the one dollar.
[389:04.82]I can't believe he's still in Anor Lando.
[389:08.25]Neither can I. The next two or three in a row are about how I'm still in Anor Lando.
[389:14.87]They missed it.
[389:15.31]They missed it.
[389:15.75]They missed it.
[389:16.15]I was gone.
[389:16.67]I went to the painting and I came back to Anor Lando.
[389:20.24]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[389:21.24]I'm sorry Chad is ruining the game for you.
[389:24.08]No, that's not true.
[389:25.84]That's not true at all.
[389:28.59]Chad is making the experience more interesting for me.
[389:34.44]I'm covered in fucking bugs.
[389:35.92]I've got poison ivy all over me.
[389:38.38]That's challenge mode.
[389:39.23]That's hard mode one.
[389:40.83]And then watching chat fight each other and me at the same time.
[389:45.15]Yelling at me to do different things.
[389:46.51]That's also another challenge.
[389:48.85]Also, this chair is not good.
[389:50.56]This chair sucks.
[389:51.60]I need a new chair.
[389:52.88]That's plus four hard mode.
[389:59.90]What is this?
[390:00.38]Wow, okay, cool.
[390:03.73]People will link me clips of shit that I don't even... It's new to me.
[390:09.77]I'm like, wow, okay, cool, yeah, man.
[390:13.85]I've never heard that before in my life.
[390:15.57]When did I say this?
[390:19.38]I haven't heard that... Did I just say that?
[390:24.46]That's weird.
[390:25.06]Because this is a stream over, so I must have done it not that long ago.
[390:31.60]That's weird.
[390:31.94]Okay.
[390:33.08]I don't remember saying that.
[390:38.77]Thanks, little dude.
[390:42.41]Still in Orlando.
[390:43.33]Yes, I am.
[390:46.03]Jerma, will you return to Darkest Dungeon now that a new DLC has come out?
[390:49.81]Love you, pal.
[390:50.45]Sir Feline, thanks a lot.
[390:52.05]Probably not.
[390:53.69]I don't think so.
[390:57.52]I think I got what I wanted from Darkest Dungeon.
[390:59.20]It's a fantastic game, but it's very, very punishing and very hard.
[391:03.72]Later.
[391:04.52]So, probably not.
[391:08.97]Getting close to the end here.
[391:09.91]Thank you, Dalek Squirrel, for the five bucks.
[391:13.17]Please, God, can we be in sub only and ban all the backseaters for the rest of the Dark Souls streams?
[391:22.18]No, I can't.
[391:25.61]Sub only?
[391:26.25]Here's the thing about sub only.
[391:27.39]You piss people off with sub only.
[391:30.69]Because it makes a point of monetary entry to interact with the chat in the stream.
[391:35.60]And it does serve a purpose.
[391:39.72]It serves a purpose.
[391:42.30]But turning it on, I feel like I'm going to piss people off.
[391:44.98]I don't want to anger people.
[391:47.11]Because it's like a shut up button.
[391:48.57]And I don't want to tell people to shut the fuck up.
[391:50.49]You know what I mean?
[391:54.00]I don't want to do that.
[391:56.92]Like, sub only mode can work, but it is kind of one of those, especially if you do it midstream, it's like a shut up.
[392:07.66]So, I don't really like to use it that often.
[392:13.40]That's not your job, it's ours.
[392:18.47]It needs to happen sometimes, but... I'm a proponent where, like, if you poke the bear, the bear is going to actually bite you now.
[392:26.65]Like, now put it in sub-only mode.
[392:28.07]Shut up, stupid idiot.
[392:29.57]It's on sub-only.
[392:31.61]It's like, oh, fuck you, dude.
[392:32.51]Thanks a lot.
[392:33.47]You do that, like, enough times?
[392:35.81]No, no, no.
[392:36.23]I don't like what that guy said.
[392:37.65]Shut up.
[392:38.87]Turn it on.
[392:39.27]Turn it on pay-me-money-only mode.
[392:45.05]I don't... I don't like to do that.
[392:47.05]But anyways, what is this?
[392:50.77]It's funny.
[392:51.25]People will link the clips of shit that I don't even... It's new to me.
[392:57.29]I'm like, wow.
[392:58.25]Okay, cool.
[392:58.77]Yeah, man.
[393:01.40]I've never heard that before in my life.
[393:03.10]When did I say this?
[393:04.22]That's weird.
[393:06.92]I haven't heard that.
[393:08.56]Did I just say that?
[393:11.40]How long ago was that?
[393:12.02]That's weird.
[393:14.40]That had to have been at least two or three hours ago, right?
[393:19.10]The stream over is still here, so I must have said it pretty recently, I guess.
[393:23.94]I don't know.
[393:29.05]That's strange.
[393:30.05]Maybe that might have been last night.
[393:32.85]No, that was last night because I remember somebody referenced the fact that I was watching a clip.
[393:43.97]Where am I?
[393:44.59]Okay, no, this is what we're doing.
[393:45.77]Okay.
[393:47.35]Thank you to Lukewarm Soda Can for the $1.
[393:49.17]Ornstein and Smough and Anor Lando are easily my favorite parts of this game.
[393:52.15]Didn't I say I fucking hate this place?
[393:53.77]I hate it.
[393:57.96]I don't actually hate it, though.
[393:59.92]I just hate that one part.
[394:01.94]Ornstein and Smough are awesome.
[394:07.34]They were very, very interesting.
[394:11.52]Thank you to Mr. McMully for the $1 here.
[394:15.36]Thanks a lot.
[394:17.57]Sylveon, thanks for the two bucks.
[394:18.79]Don't you dare go hollow.
[394:20.99]Okay, here we go.
[394:24.75]Here comes like the... Jerma is angry here.
[394:29.15]Thank you, CleverCactus, for the $1.
[394:30.58]Sub only still.
[394:31.44]I don't get it.
[394:32.46]Jerma looks at chat every 5 to 10 minutes.
[394:35.32]Are spoilers the problem?
[394:36.44]Spam?
[394:36.90]Did you guys even try using slow mode or similar?
[394:40.62]Well, the first thing, I look at chat probably every 12 seconds.
[394:45.22]I re-chat way too often.
[394:47.43]I don't look at chat every 10 minutes.
[394:49.47]I look at chat at least 20 times every minute.
[394:54.29]I'm always looking over there.
[394:55.97]I don't always say like a reply to something.
[394:59.57]I just kind of glance over and see what people are saying.
[395:06.17]Spoilers are not the problem.
[395:08.25]It's just when shit kind of gets crazy.
[395:13.83]Then read this.
[395:14.51]I mean, I am.
[395:17.18]Reading chat gets me killed all the fucking time.
[395:22.16]I glance.
[395:22.90]It's like driving a car.
[395:25.00]How many times when you drive in a car do you just check your rear view mirrors?
[395:28.65]All the time.
[395:29.41]You don't even know you're doing it.
[395:30.21]You just glance over and do it.
[395:37.23]But stuff like slow mode and sub only are supposed to prevent things like 500 people screaming at me to use a cracked orb.
[395:47.71]When it gets kind of out of hand like that is when something has to happen, right?
[395:53.22]It can't just be like a major item spoiler in the entire chat room.
[396:03.01]Actually, rear view all the time.
[396:04.13]Yeah.
[396:06.01]Do you acknowledge that you're looking in your rear view mirror all the time?
[396:08.79]You just do.
[396:15.89]I drive backwards.
[396:25.82]Clever Cactus, thank you for the $1.
[396:29.04]You're explaining why I don't use it.
[396:31.87]I don't use it very often.
[396:35.77]I probably do sub only mode.
[396:40.25]It has to be less than five times a year.
[396:43.66]It has to be.
[396:50.15]What's this one?
[396:51.33]Remember This.
[396:56.29]Wait, what happened?
[396:56.81]That's weird.
[397:21.00]I haven't heard that.
[397:22.44]Did I just say that?
[397:25.30]How long ago was that?
[397:25.92]That's weird.
[397:28.30]That had to have been like two or three hours ago, right?
[397:31.88]People do send me clips all the time.
[397:33.19]The stream over is still here, so I must have said it pretty recently, I guess.
[397:38.21]I don't know.
[397:40.89]No, you're looking at me shit from like a year ago.
[397:44.11]Okay, now I get it.
[397:45.27]Alright, you're doing this thing where you're sending me like shit from... Because remember when we did the clip joke from like a year ago and people were clipping me?
[397:54.69]This was... No, but that was during a stream.
[397:56.61]This is a stream over.
[398:00.44]I don't know what that is, but thanks, man.
[398:08.06]But thank you to Bloody Doctor for the $2.45.
[398:11.35]Cheers to you.
[398:11.91]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[398:13.21]You're the one that gets things done around here.
[398:16.41]One of the best tracks I've ever heard.
[398:20.93]Thank you, Asian Turtle, for the $1 sweating already.
[398:23.22]Oh boy, are you in for a treat once you move down here?
[398:26.24]I'm in Arizona and the temperatures have been in the high 90s the past couple of weeks.
[398:30.26]And I've been sweating like a mule in a three-piece suit.
[398:33.45]Just make sure you hydrate often.
[398:38.05]Yeah, I've heard it's brutal down there.
[398:39.83]Especially in the southwestern part of the United States.
[398:43.24]It can break a hundred.
[398:44.24]It can break a hundred plus.
[398:50.22]I'm ready for it.
[398:51.26]I got my swimmies.
[398:53.68]Upward dig!
[398:54.44]Thanks for the one dollar.
[398:55.14]This should be a pleb-only mode.
[398:57.26]No sub-only mode should just be used, like, sparingly throughout the year.
[399:00.74]Not more than a few times a year.
[399:03.42]Dark Souls kind of is just one of those games that needs it sometimes.
[399:08.56]But like I said, I just said it.
[399:11.33]I don't like to use it.
[399:14.27]It's like kind of too much power.
[399:18.37]Because if sub only was something else besides you have to pay $5 to talk, then maybe I would use it more often if there was like a way to, I don't know.
[399:29.09]I just don't want to make it like that.
[399:34.65]Slow mode helps, but I mean, when you have three, 34, whether they were like 32, 30, over 3000 people here, it's hard.
[399:45.19]It's difficult to moderate and manage a channel that has a bunch of people in the chat.
[399:52.71]Especially when shit goes like out of control.
[399:54.61]There's a lot of people to kind of go out of control.
[400:01.39]One year follower only mode.
[400:08.79]But thank you, dude.
[400:09.85]Thank you to Broluck for the $1.
[400:13.01]Start the fucking Donos, boys.
[400:16.15]We won the jackpot.
[400:19.94]We did.
[400:20.34]All it took was me to take off my clothes.
[400:23.04]In-game, as you are aware.
[400:24.26]Thank you, Bugchips, for the $1.
[400:25.60]Powerful.
[400:26.10]Thank you.
[400:27.28]Shrewberry, thanks for the $1.
[400:28.54]Here's some money for beating Ornstein and Smough.
[400:30.24]Hope you like it, Jellybean.
[400:31.44]Looking dumbo.
[400:32.16]Thank you, Shrewberry.
[400:34.73]It was a good fight.
[400:37.44]Thank you, lukewarm soda can for the $1.
[400:38.86]Yay, Ornstein is smogger.
[400:40.06]Great.
[400:40.38]Second phase, Ornstein gets like 25 feet tall.
[400:42.88]It's fantastic.
[400:44.86]The fight is fun because it's extremely fair, but you have to have a good grasp of the game to win.
[400:52.32]Yeah, that's a great fight.
[400:54.82]Challenging.
[400:59.08]It's needing to pay attention to both at the same time.
[401:02.59]They don't really move that fast.
[401:03.95]I mean, Orenstein has that dash across the whole area move.
[401:10.47]But you can see it coming.
[401:11.57]There's a little white tail that kind of goes on the end of his spear there.
[401:15.41]So you can know it's coming.
[401:18.30]They both move slow enough where you just have to, who's going to do where?
[401:21.06]Where are you?
[401:21.70]Just keeping track of the two of them at the same time is challenging but fun.
[401:31.32]Second phase smog is a cakewalk.
[401:33.94]Yeah, honestly, when he does the charge and he throws his hammer up in the air, he goes like, wham!
[401:41.18]Just timing that correctly.
[401:44.39]I had to figure that out because he doesn't just go straight.
[401:47.17]He kind of pulls his hammer back just a couple of frames.
[401:51.05]It's just like, what?
[401:52.19]And then he comes forward.
[401:54.05]So right when you kind of see the face of his hammer showing up, that's when you start the dodge.
[401:59.45]Not before that, which is what I was doing before.
[402:04.43]It was a good fight.
[402:08.63]Thank you, though.
[402:09.51]Thank you, though, lukewarm soda.
[402:12.21]Spoocha, thanks for the five dollars.
[402:13.69]I said I would donate if you beat them on your last round, and holy shit.
[402:19.28]My ass has never been so clenched from just watching that fight.
[402:21.88]I'm so proud of you.
[402:22.90]Enjoy it.
[402:24.00]Thank you so much.
[402:27.16]Again, when you're at the bottom... Guys, when you're at the bottom, there's only one way to go.
[402:31.14]Up.
[402:35.25]Where else to go?
[402:35.79]Especially when you're lying on concrete.
[402:39.03]Are you going to dig through the concrete with your hands?
[402:42.93]Thank you, Drew Burt, for the 10 bucks.
[402:45.98]That last Ornstein and Smough boss fight was possibly the best thing I've ever seen in a stream.
[402:50.04]You are the best, Jeremiah.
[402:55.24]I'm happy you think that highly of that.
[403:00.82]Thank you so much.
[403:03.64]There's probably more shit, harder things in the game, maybe.
[403:06.66]Hopefully I can beat them.
[403:10.10]But that's... Thank you so much for saying that.
[403:12.80]Appreciate it.
[403:15.12]Thanks for the ten bucks as well, Drew.
[403:17.42]Blue Misfortune, thanks for the five dollars.
[403:19.50]Jex Awakened, jermaJex.
[403:22.84]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the one dollar.
[403:24.38]Hey Jerma, I downloaded the game Cryptarch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised to hear your voice slipping into my ears.
[403:33.02]Yeah, I am in that game.
[403:35.48]I am one of the characters in Cryptark.
[403:39.42]So, Grandpa Engineer Frog.
[403:46.47]Thank you, though.
[403:47.33]Thank you, Morta.
[403:49.51]Mortag for the... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[403:52.31]Whatever.
[403:53.33]He's here.
[403:53.85]He's, like, here in the chat.
[403:54.91]I just want to make sure you knew he was here.
[403:57.45]Mighty Waffle, thanks for the $1.
[403:58.69]Is that story about exploding into planets the official solar system lore?
[404:02.55]Yes.
[404:04.14]Hey, Brolock, thanks for the $1.
[404:05.06]And it's a Twitch clip and it's probably the snort.
[404:07.30]No, it's not.
[404:19.01]You can hear me.
[404:21.31]Listen to this.
[404:21.85]You can hear me moving around in this.
[404:28.80]Just watch this.
[404:30.39]This is after losing, this is after dying or something and being really angry.
[404:33.17]Listen to me fucking moving around like fidgeting around the fucking chair.
[404:36.06]Listen to that.
[404:48.46]That's funny you can actually hear me move around.
[404:53.74]It's a new sub sound.
[404:55.63]I would lose a lot of viewers.
[404:59.26]Thank you Luke Wormsortican again for the $1.
[405:01.00]The backseating in chat today has been fucking unreal.
[405:04.09]Jesus Christ, guys.
[405:05.23]Let him play how he wants.
[405:08.43]It's okay.
[405:10.39]It's okay.
[405:12.97]Yeah.
[405:14.41]We got it.
[405:14.81]We did it.
[405:17.60]Thank you Tar Alacrin for the $1.
[405:19.10]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[405:23.40]New subsound when?
[405:24.90]Saturday or the Twitch channel gets deleted.
[405:28.64]No soup for you.
[405:29.24]Thanks for the $5.
[405:30.00]Here's your consolation prize.
[405:30.90]Again, I only died to Ornstein and Smough six times, so well done.
[405:34.52]Enjoy the rest of the game Saturday.
[405:35.87]I won't be there.
[405:37.57]jermaPluto.
[405:39.93]Well, we will take your energy soup.
[405:41.31]Thank you for your support.
[405:46.00]Appreciate it.
[405:47.56]Smitty W, thanks for the two bucks.
[405:48.72]Is it bad that hearing fake spoilers for zombie priests actually made me feel mad for being spoiled?
[405:55.12]It's just an ASMR.
[405:56.32]It's an auditory, systematic, mundane reaction.
[406:01.28]It's an auditory ASMR reaction to hearing a spoiler, so it's okay.
[406:09.05]I feel you.
[406:11.67]Thank you, Reaper, for the $1.
[406:13.11]Jerma the Priest is the bad guy.
[406:14.33]Also, remember to eat that raspberry.
[406:19.24]I will choose to eat or not eat the raspberries whenever I decide to.
[406:22.46]Thank you, though.
[406:24.89]Thank you, lukewarm soda can again for the one dollar.
[406:26.83]There's a few spoilers every now and again on minor things.
[406:28.89]That's not the problem.
[406:30.67]We mentioned this before when you came in with it.
[406:33.84]Hundreds of people are screaming at him to do something.
[406:35.30]It pressures him to do it.
[406:38.42]I mean, here, one more thing I'll add to that is because this game's been out for a long time and because there's a lot of things you can do in Dark Souls to fuck up a run in quotes
[406:56.29]an item that I could have gotten or should have gotten that would really be good, a piece of gear that you really should fucking get.
[407:04.63]I understand.
[407:05.25]I look at that.
[407:08.07]I know that when people are writing, hey, get it, do this, do this, do this, do this, I don't want to miss content, but I also don't, like you said, want to be pressured to have to get something specific.
[407:22.69]You can just play it again anyways.
[407:24.73]Yeah, I know, but
[407:27.82]I think a lot of people want me, want you, whatever, to get the specific thing that they know that you kind of should have and need because everybody does because everybody knows where it is.
[407:38.45]I think it might be, there probably are a lot of people that don't know that this is 100% blind from here and not from me.
[407:56.21]Ater beating the scorpion lava queen I don't know anything else in the whole game.
[408:01.21]I've never even used the lord vessel once.
[408:06.21]This is all new material for me from here on out.
[408:09.21]I don't maybe come maybe people pop in the chat and they go: What the fuck is this guy doing? Why has he not done this yet?
[408:15.21]I mean everybody's played Dark Souls by this point. What the hell are you doing?
[408:17.21]You didn- what you didn't get that sword? What are you doing? Did you forget?
[408:22.21]Did you forget to get the sword? I should remind him to get that sword.
[408:31.80]So, I don't know.
[408:33.52]Most of it's not malicious.
[408:35.30]Why would it be, right?
[408:36.82]People want to be helpful.
[408:39.40]I've clearly watched speedrunners.
[408:42.47]Yeah, but I mean, a Dark Souls speedrun is... They jump over whole levels.
[408:50.35]They skip whole pieces of content.
[408:52.32]They miss the whole game.
[408:55.67]I've watched, and it's been a long time, but one of the, I think it was like an AGDQ.
[409:02.59]I had it on in the background and I was watching it.
[409:04.97]It was the last time I saw like a Dark Souls 1 speedrun.
[409:07.90]They beat the game in like an hour, not even.
[409:10.14]I remember watching and this guy literally jumped off a cliff and jumped over an entire level.
[409:17.22]And then he was at some boss.
[409:18.36]I don't even know who it is.
[409:23.84]So, I mean, just because I may have seen portions or parts of a Dark Souls 1 speedrun doesn't mean I know where all the items are in the game and how to have specific NPCs do specific pieces of dialogue to get me certain items.
[409:39.38]I may have seen a couple of the bosses and I'm like, oh yeah, I remember seeing that in a random speedrun.
[409:48.68]It's a little over an hour.
[409:52.58]You can skip 40% of Bloodborne by jumping over a fence in the game.
[409:56.38]That's what I mean.
[409:56.90]If you can't fly, you're doing it wrong.
[410:08.87]You don't like super glitchy runs.
[410:10.13]You want to see game mastery, not avoiding playing.
[410:13.11]Well, that's where any percent comes in, right?
[410:16.11]Any percent just means do it as fast as you can and beat the game.
[410:18.65]Get to the end screen as fast as possible.
[410:21.26]All boss runs, I mean, those still exist, don't they?
[410:27.88]Completely blind.
[410:28.88]I've seen a lot of the bosses, though.
[410:32.16]Yeah, I mean, well, blind enough.
[410:38.79]Look, okay.
[410:40.67]I know what Gwyn looks like.
[410:43.05]That's it.
[410:44.69]Then you know why the whole completely blind have seen bosses?
[410:49.11]Guys, I don't even know what Gwyn does for a move.
[410:54.81]I don't know what he does.
[410:55.97]I've never seen him swing a sword.
[410:58.65]I watched a speedrun.
[411:01.11]He dies in one hit in every speedrun.
[411:03.95]I've never seen him swing a weapon.
[411:09.79]I don't know what he does.
[411:15.71]He's dead in that speedrun every time.
[411:21.68]So blind?
[411:22.42]Yes, I've seen a picture of Gwyn.
[411:26.52]There you go.
[411:27.76]Is that enough to say that I can't say I'm blind in the game?
[411:30.62]Yeah, I've seen a series of photos of these bosses.
[411:37.01]That's it.
[411:37.29]Because they all die in less than one or two hits anyways from everybody speedrunning them.
[411:45.54]So, I mean, that is blind.
[411:51.17]Is this the most transparent streamer?
[411:52.93]Yes, it is.
[411:53.47]I proved it.
[412:01.61]You see him, so you're not blind.
[412:04.30]Well, I mean, in like a game sense, like a gameplay sense.
[412:06.94]I've never played through Dark Souls 1.
[412:09.70]I may have seen what some of the bosses look like.
[412:14.98]But that doesn't matter.
[412:16.18]You can show me a picture of Ornstein and Smough.
[412:18.80]That's fine.
[412:20.16]How am I supposed to... I don't know how to play against them.
[412:28.15]Are you sure you can handle the Vegas heat?
[412:30.87]Maybe not.
[412:33.02]But anyways, we're almost done here.
[412:37.46]Where are we?
[412:40.63]Where, where, where, where?
[412:41.47]Here we go.
[412:42.11]Uh, Kyra, Toby, thanks for the one dollar.
[412:43.43]Gentlemen, remember this one?
[412:44.27]How far we've come.
[412:47.21]He's gonna get me in here.
[412:57.09]Oh my god, what a, what a chimpanzee.
[413:02.13]You gotta be kidding me.
[413:10.13]That just scared the shit out of me.
[413:11.95]And I did it.
[413:12.48]He's gonna get me in here.
[413:15.06]What happened there?
[413:15.64]Okay, I was trying to parry with my hand.
[413:25.36]Donkey Kong.
[413:26.02]Oh my god.
[413:26.88]Relax.
[413:31.72]Thank you, Super Spy Burger Flipper.
[413:40.22]Thank you for the 50 cents.
[413:42.32]Whoops.
[413:42.76]Thank you.
[413:43.20]Upward dig for the $1.
[413:44.50]Appreciate that, Super.
[413:46.44]Snap.
[413:47.04]Yep, that's going in the cringe compilation.
[413:48.97]Why?
[413:49.19]What's with the snap?
[413:50.03]Why are you like, hey, that's the one.
[413:51.45]I don't understand.
[413:53.99]You're the third person that's gone.
[413:55.51]Yeah.
[413:57.35]Like, are you putting your hand down?
[413:58.37]Like, bang.
[414:00.83]Mighty Waffle, thanks for the $1.
[414:01.83]What did jermaSaturn do to you?
[414:03.51]Nothing.
[414:05.10]Lukewarm soda can, thanks for the $1.
[414:06.54]I bet a guy yesterday that you wouldn't reach 150 deaths on yesterday's stream.
[414:10.73]I still gave money, though, because I'm an idiot who doesn't understand betting.
[414:14.97]Take me with you to Vegas.
[414:18.15]But you bet a guy that I wouldn't reach 150 deaths on yesterday's stream.
[414:23.68]I didn't.
[414:27.54]I didn't die 150 times.
[414:32.27]You still gave him the money.
[414:33.57]So wait, so you won, but you still gave him money.
[414:41.66]You won the bet.
[414:42.22]I don't know.
[414:46.42]Thank you, Morgan.
[414:47.74]Morgan P. for the $1.
[414:49.18]Thanks for the great content, Jerma.
[414:50.20]Get some rest.
[414:50.62]I'll see you when I awake from my slumber.
[414:52.28]Thank you.
[414:52.85]Have a good night.
[414:55.27]Kato Ava.
[414:55.95]Thanks for the $1.
[414:56.59]Looking forward to more of the Big B-Boy.
[414:58.31]Have a great night and see you Saturday.
[415:00.73]See you then.
[415:01.72]Take care.
[415:02.80]Morgan P., thanks for the $1.
[415:04.02]Do you like the Dropkick Murphys?
[415:06.13]Shippin' up to Boston.
[415:07.59]Oh, oh, oh.
[415:09.15]Shippin' up to Boston.
[415:11.69]Of course I do.
[415:13.33]Thank you, Tar Alecren, for the $1.
[415:15.17]Here is a clip.
[415:16.07]It's a Twitch clip.
[415:17.74]Fuck you.
[415:17.96]You guys suck.
[415:26.57]Thank you, Morgan P., for the $1.
[415:28.33]Cheer 100.
[415:28.89]Thanks a lot, man.
[415:30.13]BroLuck, thanks for the $1.
[415:31.35]Just set up certain amount of time, follower-only mode.
[415:35.69]We'll see how it goes Saturday.
[415:36.67]I think it'll be fine.
[415:38.60]VR Josh, thanks for the $5.
[415:39.80]I've been watching your videos since way back in the TF2 days.
[415:43.20]I'm rooting for you to be successful, and I hope you achieve all your life goals.
[415:47.20]You've made a difference in a lot of people's lives just by being entertaining in a world that can feel really rough a lot of the time.
[415:55.23]Thank you so much, VR Josh.
[415:59.32]A lot of really nice things that you just said.
[416:03.44]Worlds can be pretty rough.
[416:05.88]That's why you gotta fucking make jokes.
[416:11.24]Might as well laugh, right?
[416:14.38]Might as well laugh at a world that's fucking rough as shit.
[416:19.80]We're all in this goddamn thing together.
[416:24.29]Dark Souls is rough.
[416:29.25]It's a ghost party, thanks for the $5.55.
[416:31.65]Gerber, when will you change your subsound?
[416:34.31]I miss Paul Bearer.
[416:35.09]Saturday, the whole channel gets deleted, and my YouTube account will get deleted too.
[416:39.07]And I will sell my house, and I'm going to delete my house.
[416:42.78]And I'll live in a box.
[416:45.70]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.00.
[416:47.16]Finally, at the very end, I like how you just assumed I'd post a snort link.
[416:51.02]Why are you going to do that to me, considering you try to get me fired from work?
[416:57.04]Broluck, thanks again for the $1.00.
[416:59.95]fuck's sake I can't look at this mum part mate it's so annoying looking at my co-worker in this game it's so similar she even acts the same fuck I don't know uh I got an idea for you bro like maybe you should stop watching streams at work that's true what are you doing at work
[417:26.43]Put in an earphone.
[417:27.27]Put in an earphone and then just pull up the presentation that you're working on and have it, like, lowered down while you're watching it at work.
[417:35.67]And then Clueless Sniper at the very end.
[417:36.94]Wow, thanks for the $1.
[417:38.28]Is this guy still on stream over screen?
[417:42.14]Yes, he is, but not anymore.
[417:44.60]Thanks again for watching, everybody.
[417:46.04]See you on Saturday.
[417:47.06]More Dark Souls.
[417:48.82]Ornstein and Spock down.
[417:49.66]Awesome, man.
[417:51.32]Sweet.
[417:52.64]I'm trying to end.
[417:53.30]I don't know what to say.
[417:55.82]Um...
[417:58.39]Got a little heated at the end.
[418:00.54]That was some depression heat.
[418:01.66]That was like gamer depression, gamer exhaustion heat.
[418:06.74]That wasn't real heat.
[418:07.52]You want to see real heat, catch Saturday.
[418:09.44]You know what I mean?
[418:10.50]Hey, don't want to miss Saturday.
[418:12.36]I bet you he's going to fucking freak out on Saturday.
[418:15.07]Don't miss that stream.
[418:16.05]He goes nuts sometimes.
[418:20.01]Thank you, guys.
[418:21.65]Much love to you.
[418:22.39]See you Saturday.
[418:25.17]I just got back because he's still here.
[418:26.43]Yes, not anymore.
[418:27.43]Good night.
[418:28.31]Goodbye, bro-luck.
[418:29.59]Goodbye.
[418:33.88]I just realized that that was off the whole time, but now it's on.
[418:41.94]Fuck outta here!
[418:48.41]Where is it?
[418:53.67]No!
[419:02.34]Calm down.
[419:14.11]What the hell was that?
[419:14.99]I don't even know how I did that shit.
[419:18.01]It said Jerma sprinkler.
[419:21.47]What is this Jerm of box?
[419:22.65]What's with all these clips at the end here?
[419:24.55]I like this.
[419:29.44]Hey, what's up?
[419:40.82]We're back.
[419:44.86]What kind of drugs do I take?
[419:46.98]None, but like how many?
[419:48.83]Zero.
[419:49.17]Have a good night.
