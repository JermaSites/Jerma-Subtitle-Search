[00:06.51]And now a thunderstorm.
[00:08.45]What was that?
[00:09.41]It was like, it was just thunder.
[00:11.55]Oh, oh.
[00:13.13]I gotta turn my volume down again.
[00:15.83]Get that, son of a bee.
[00:19.27]Alright, so you're saying we should... Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[00:22.83]I'm making a chest so we can store like 30 bones.
[00:27.30]I brought just a little bit of wood, just enough to make a chest.
[00:30.14]What can we do with the fermented spider sack?
[00:32.48]What is that?
[00:32.94]What are we doing with that?
[00:33.84]Ugh.
[00:35.23]I think it's for potion making.
[00:37.39]But I don't know.
[00:38.35]I'm not good with potions.
[00:42.27]There's redstone torches in here too.
[00:43.69]Should we just take them?
[00:46.55]If there's redstone torches, yeah.
[00:47.88]Take those and we'll put them in the chest as well.
[00:52.12]I got seven arrows in here for some reason.
[00:54.36]Probably from the skeletons.
[00:56.88]I'm throwing down... Where'd you go?
[00:59.16]Oh, over there.
[01:01.57]Oh, relay.
[01:03.37]Redstone torches are going to be on your way back here.
[01:05.51]They're right on the ground over there.
[01:06.43]I'm doing some more exploring.
[01:09.06]I'm trying to find some stuff.
[01:13.08]Alright, and I've only got two loaves of bread left.
[01:17.38]I guess, here's the thing.
[01:18.20]Whenever we start getting hungry, we can just come back out and use all of the bones on the wheat farm that we just replanted.
[01:28.11]What does it mean when there's just a thing of fire just sitting here burning on obsidian?
[01:33.29]Where are we at?
[01:35.67]I think that's just netherrack.
[01:38.18]But all the redstone torches around it kind of freak me out.
[01:41.56]I'm not gonna lie.
[01:43.56]I got a bunch of arrows now.
[01:45.88]Here's seven more.
[01:47.02]Alright, here's what we're gonna have to do.
[01:50.33]See how the floor is made out of obsidian?
[01:52.35]Yeah.
[01:53.26]That's scary, because there could be explosions here.
[01:55.78]Obsidian is resistant to explosions, so like... You know what I'm saying?
[02:00.33]Like the floor won't crumble.
[02:01.79]Okay, I see.
[02:02.11]When something explodes.
[02:03.95]So... Be careful when you're removing these redstone torches, because they could set off... Explosion.
[02:10.43]Yeah, so we gotta listen.
[02:13.93]Alright.
[02:15.52]We're good.
[02:16.42]And that's... What is that?
[02:17.52]Netherrack.
[02:19.14]So is this just, that's it?
[02:20.46]There's nothing else here?
[02:21.18]I hope we don't just randomly explode.
[02:24.62]I feel like there should be, like, another area or something.
[02:29.72]What's with, like, the broken edges on these walls?
[02:32.16]You know what I mean?
[02:32.62]See how, like, the walls are kind of cracked over here?
[02:34.28]Um, I... What's that mean?
[02:37.62]Yeah, that's... I don't know.
[02:39.36]Ooh, there's another area.
[02:40.32]Good find, Jerma.
[02:41.82]Good find.
[02:43.20]Watch out, that's lava.
[02:44.84]Okay.
[02:47.52]Can you get that chest without... Ooh, a golden sword, which is not the greatest thing in the world, but there's another one over here.
[02:54.00]Okay, do you have a pickaxe?
[02:55.94]Did I already ask you that?
[02:57.04]I do not have a pickaxe.
[02:58.18]Here, take mine.
[02:59.20]I've got a lot more stuff than you, so break the other side.
[03:03.42]I'm really scared something's going to explode in here.
[03:05.38]Alright, here we go.
[03:09.65]I'm, like, trying to stay as far back as I can.
[03:11.27]Alright, it's a very long hallway and a sign.
[03:16.25]You can have that back.
[03:20.42]You want me to go first?
[03:21.69]I guess, man.
[03:22.49]Obsidian Hall.
[03:23.55]Well, nothing can get through us in this hallway.
[03:26.27]Shivering Sands.
[03:27.55]One record.
[03:28.85]This is a whole other area, it sounds like.
[03:30.85]Well, apparently you dropped down.
[03:35.08]That looks kind of sketchy.
[03:36.72]I know.
[03:36.88]I don't know about that.
[03:38.98]Hang on.
[03:39.22]I think I saw something back up where we just were.
[03:41.16]Let's check that out first.
[03:43.69]Yeah, we gotta break down all the cracked walls.
[03:46.73]I think one of these is actually made out of cobblestone, so that would definitely be more obvious.
[03:54.36]Oh yeah, more chests!
[03:56.44]Man, one of these rooms is gonna be a trap.
[03:58.16]There's no way there's this much free stuff.
[04:01.94]Seriously.
[04:02.60]Buckets!
[04:03.30]So we can, like, move our wheat farm.
[04:07.48]We can, like, pick up water with the bucket.
[04:09.58]Here, just in case one of us dies, here's the other bucket.
[04:12.90]Ooh, a bucket!
[04:14.46]So we can pick up and move water.
[04:16.84]That's good.
[04:17.68]Or lava, if we wanted to.
[04:18.86]And do you see how some of these are different?
[04:21.27]Why is it so dark in here?
[04:22.29]I'm kind of freaking out.
[04:23.61]That's because I took all the redstone torches.
[04:27.54]I'll use one torch, just so nothing spawns behind us.
[04:30.24]I guess this just leads to the other hallway.
[04:33.21]Yeah.
[04:33.81]Ah!
[04:34.25]Oh no, it's a silverfish!
[04:36.25]Ah!
[04:36.73]Shoot it!
[04:37.75]Kill it!
[04:38.57]It's silverfish, so all of the light-colored stones are silverfish, I think.
[04:43.29]I don't know, what are they on your texture pack?
[04:45.93]This is, uh, DokuCraft.
[04:48.53]On mine.
[04:50.12]What stone am I looking at?
[04:51.10]Like, uh, this stone right here, and this stone right below it.
[04:54.90]Like this one right there?
[04:56.34]Yeah.
[04:57.08]It just looks like a regular stone.
[04:58.90]Okay, so apparently, for some reason with Dokka Craft, they're distinguished.
[05:02.40]Some of these stones in here are silverfish, so if you break them, then those little things come out and try to eat you.
[05:09.67]Can we, like, tame them as pets?
[05:13.01]That would be awesome.
[05:14.09]But what's funny is if, like, one silverfish comes across another block, he'll, like, unlock that one, too.
[05:19.67]Oh, really?
[05:20.55]So, like, you could have, like, a little army of silverfish.
[05:23.47]Do you want to go take a peek at that, like, sand whatever area?
[05:26.85]Yeah, you might as well, right?
[05:29.06]You gotta be careful, though, because there's a chance when you get to the bottom of the ladder that there won't be a way to get back up or something.
[05:36.31]Yeah.
[05:38.09]If that's the case, I'll just write you a postcard when I get back.
[05:42.46]You want me to go first?
[05:43.78]I don't know, man.
[05:44.54]Hang on, hang on.
[05:45.18]I got a sword for you if you can promise not to die with it.
[05:49.52]Um... Okay.
[05:52.50]I don't know which is better.
[05:53.50]I guess, uh... Well, I have a ton of arrows with this bow.
[05:57.63]Here, then take this sword.
[05:59.81]Give me the worst thing you have.
[06:01.61]I don't know which one of these is better.
[06:02.79]This golden sword has Smite 3 enchanted on it, which sounds awesome, so I'm gonna use that.
[06:08.51]Alright, um... Here we go.
[06:16.03]I'm gonna follow close behind.
[06:17.96]There's something down here.
[06:19.06]I just saw it move.
[06:19.96]If you hold shift, then you stop moving down.
[06:22.40]Okay, yeah, there's definitely a bunch of monsters down here.
[06:24.44]Are you right above me?
[06:25.56]Yeah.
[06:25.78]Alright, here we go.
[06:26.78]This is it.
[06:27.10]What kind of monsters?
[06:27.80]Why is it blinking down here?
[06:29.94]It's a spawner.
[06:31.74]Oh, there's a bunch of dudes.
[06:35.52]Why is my screen flashing?
[06:37.88]Oh, I think it froze.
[06:38.86]It froze.
[06:40.58]Oh my gosh.
[06:41.92]The server just froze down here.
[06:44.29]Did it really?
[06:46.39]We're good.
[06:47.11]I'm alive in here.
[06:47.81]We're good.
[06:48.75]Okay, guys, the server just crashed.
[06:52.03]And is likely to do so again because this map has trouble with Minecraft 1.2.3.
[06:56.94]At least we got our stuff.
[07:00.18]It's doing the armor glitch again, I think.
[07:02.44]Oh yeah, it definitely is.
[07:03.54]Can you see mine now?
[07:05.08]Can you see mine now?
[07:08.14]Is it on?
[07:09.48]Mine's on.
[07:09.90]I can't see yours.
[07:10.48]Is this thing on?
[07:11.71]Is it working?
[07:12.73]Testing, hello?
[07:14.23]I don't see yours.
[07:15.09]Can you see mine?
[07:16.31]Maybe it takes a second to load.
[07:17.59]Can you hear me now?
[07:19.83]I'll take it all off.
[07:22.07]Oh, yeah, that's where it's shooting at.
[07:25.04]Alright, mine is all off.
[07:26.52]Here we go.
[07:28.16]Here comes the helmet.
[07:29.54]Here comes the tunic, pants, boots.
[07:32.72]I see nothing, so I'm just going to assume that you're clothed.
[07:36.15]Alright, same here.
[07:37.11]Oh, no.
[07:40.48]Ain't going to work.
[07:41.02]Ain't going to work.
