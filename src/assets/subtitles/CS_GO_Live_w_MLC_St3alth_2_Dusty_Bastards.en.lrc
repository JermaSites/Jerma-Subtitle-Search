[00:06.95]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:10.73]Jerma and MLC Stealth here.
[00:13.33]We're going to be playing some CSGO Live.
[00:16.23]And I'm not sure how well he's going to do, but I know I'm not going to do that well.
[00:20.34]But that's okay.
[00:21.70]Oh, I'm already dead.
[00:23.00]Oh, that's one.
[00:24.28]So, I'm not going to do very well.
[00:27.36]You better spectate me.
[00:28.20]I'm going to go in a tirade.
[00:29.68]This guy right here.
[00:32.76]Oh, get locked out.
[00:35.68]Oh, that's his name.
[00:36.64]I just, like, said the guy's name while I shot him.
[00:38.34]Anybody?
[00:38.74]What we got?
[00:40.08]Did you not mean to?
[00:40.72]I didn't... I said his name, and I was subconsciously saying it, and I said it by looking at it.
[00:46.52]That was weird.
[00:47.34]Oh.
[00:47.46]Alright, I don't... There's nobody left.
[00:49.76]What are you doing?
[00:50.71]I'm checking to see if there's any spawn brats.
[00:52.73]I don't know.
[00:53.93]This isn't Call of Duty.
[00:55.75]There might be somebody that's, like, AFK.
[00:58.05]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[00:59.39]There's only me and... Yeah, you don't even have dead silence on.
[01:01.63]You're just running rampart.
[01:03.41]Rampart.
[01:04.11]Rampant.
[01:05.60]Our teammate's dead.
[01:06.94]Oh, so it's a one-on-one, huh?
[01:08.92]Where'd he die?
[01:10.22]Oh, wait.
[01:10.58]Okay.
[01:11.06]Okay, this is where it gets interesting.
[01:14.36]Pick up that sniper.
[01:15.26]Hey, just hit E, like, control me.
[01:16.92]I'm a bot.
[01:17.70]I'm trying.
[01:19.11]Oh, get out of town!
[01:20.79]Oh, yeah, nice crouching.
[01:23.57]Nice 60% of the team killing.
[01:25.33]I didn't really introduce me, but you introduced me for me, so it's alright.
[01:30.11]Well, introduce yourself for you now.
[01:31.65]Hey, everybody!
[01:33.45]Alright, that's...
[01:34.99]Hey, everybody.
[01:37.14]Wait, I already have everything?
[01:39.36]Oh yeah, so we tried doing this live commentary once, but about 14 seconds into it, my computer said, no, and it just, like, canceled out of Counter-Strike.
[01:48.11]But as I was saying before, we're both, like, awful at live commentaries because we can't multitask.
[01:53.31]Yeah, I will agree with that.
[01:56.63]Please don't hit me.
[01:59.07]I have the op now.
[02:00.14]Why did I just click?
[02:01.02]I'm an idiot.
[02:02.08]I need to buy some grenades.
[02:02.98]Oh my god.
[02:05.34]Lockdown got his revenge.
[02:09.36]That means I can follow you.
[02:10.24]Well, there you are.
[02:11.54]Oh, you dead?
[02:12.20]Yeah, I'm spectating you now.
[02:14.94]Where am I getting shot from?
[02:17.94]Top and bottom, it looks like.
[02:20.82]Oh, really?
[02:22.56]Come on, Slater.
[02:24.30]Did he shoot through the surface?
[02:27.54]Is that what that... I got killed by Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[02:31.93]Well, there goes my AWP.
[02:34.52]Oh, yeah, I got killed by Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[02:38.62]Yeah, I think that means they shot through a surface.
[02:41.00]I'm pretty sure that's what that means.
[02:42.61]I'm two and three.
[02:45.69]Dang, I'm just... See, I'm used to bots not knowing how to, like, move and standing still in spawn and running the same way every single time.
[02:53.65]Why aren't these guys doing that?
[02:54.91]I don't know.
[02:55.79]I mean, these are... There's only one bot in this whole game, and he's on our team.
[03:02.48]Anyone see him?
[03:03.36]Already dead.
[03:04.36]Oh my god.
[03:05.48]Got killed by Dwayne again.
[03:07.12]Where is this guy that you just got killed by?
[03:10.60]Oh, people are really gonna love the live commentary on my part.
[03:13.82]Spectating the whole time.
[03:17.39]Wait, ugh.
[03:18.47]It's just me!
[03:19.05]I'm the only person alive!
[03:20.19]Oh, great.
[03:21.25]Yeah, it's a one versus five.
[03:22.95]This is fantastic.
[03:24.71]Get outta here.
[03:27.47]Oh, where was that guy?
[03:29.35]He's killing a lot of us.
[03:30.81]He's four.
[03:31.36]He must have seen me kill his brethren.
[03:35.60]He must have seen you kill Gangster Bobber.
[03:39.30]Only explanation.
[03:40.40]I didn't even use my grenades.
[03:42.06]I was so taken back by my team getting destroyed.
[03:47.03]Alright, this is gonna be the one.
[03:48.85]Me and you are both gonna kill the whole team.
[03:50.25]You ready?
[03:50.67]Really sure?
[03:52.07]I'm gonna get that MVP again like I did that one time?
[03:55.19]That you weren't recording?
[03:57.70]I actually was recording.
[03:59.92]But you said you were.
[04:01.28]Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that I didn't have any pressure on.
[04:03.12]Alright, I'm right behind you.
[04:05.44]I'm throwing, I'm throwing, watch out.
[04:06.56]I'm throwing this in there.
[04:07.77]Eat fire!
[04:08.81]Oh, I'm dead.
[04:10.69]Do I have a bomb?
[04:11.65]Oh, eat fire.
[04:14.69]Where's the guy?
[04:16.99]He's right down there.
[04:17.83]I'm sure if you keep shooting, he'll eventually run into your balls.
[04:21.59]I don't want to get lucky headshotted, though.
[04:23.05]I always just turn the corner and go, and just get nailed.
[04:25.89]Oh, that's what I've done for five rounds in a row.
[04:32.09]Not even guarding the bomb.
[04:33.21]Trying to get that last kill.
[04:34.76]There he is.
[04:35.96]Come on.
[04:37.70]Oh!
[04:38.30]God damn it.
[04:42.92]That sucks.
[04:44.38]Is he just gonna sit back there the whole time?
[04:45.98]I don't know, probably.
[04:46.87]Look at our guy with the AK just trying to, like, straight shoot.
[04:49.37]Hopefully this Pyro gets him, though.
[04:51.75]There you go.
[04:53.01]He sure did.
[04:53.97]Oh, no, no, no.
[04:54.57]Somebody else did.
[04:55.19]There you go.
[04:58.65]Do I have... I don't have money, because I keep sucking.
[05:03.08]I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go Deagle.
[05:05.64]I think I'm gonna go Deagle this round.
[05:07.02]Hey, give me money.
[05:07.90]I don't even have enough for, like, things.
[05:09.46]Hey, open a trade.
[05:10.02]I'll give you, like, a thousand dollars.
[05:13.20]Is that even possible in this game?
[05:15.20]I don't think so.
[05:16.38]Because, I'm not sure if you're joking or this is... Yeah, hey, open up a trade.
[05:20.63]Let me give you, like, a couple of guns.
[05:22.01]Hey, let's go right again.
[05:23.09]Because I have a sniper now.
[05:24.43]I'm way behind.
[05:25.51]I'm behind you.
[05:27.47]Oh.
[05:27.73]Looks like they're... You said you went where?
[05:29.57]You went right?
[05:29.99]Right.
[05:30.88]Yeah.
[05:32.24]Oh my god!
[05:36.25]This game scares the hell out of me, man.
[05:37.85]It really does.
[05:39.71]Can you crouch jump in this?
[05:41.68]Oh, don't worry.
[05:42.10]I took control of the bot.
[05:43.22]I'm good.
[05:46.77]I have a sniper rifle.
[05:48.43]Why does this bot have the default pistol?
[05:51.05]Oh, I just, oh, I almost shot you in the head, Jerma.
[05:54.39]Well, don't worry, I got shot in the head regardless from Gangsta Boobies, whatever that guy's name is.
[06:00.00]I'm pretty sure I shot him in the head and nothing happened.
[06:01.66]Oh, there you are.
[06:03.58]Oh, no!
[06:05.70]I shot his up.
[06:06.84]God, Gangsta Bobby.
[06:10.30]Gangsta Bobby.
[06:11.36]Hey, look, I killed him.
[06:13.13]Are you kidding?
[06:13.90]No, not even.
[06:14.52]Oh, I'm on Eagle.
[06:16.60]Eagle is a reptile.
[06:17.54]Let's go ahead and pull.
[06:22.24]Time to buy the AUG and no body armor.
[06:26.04]See, that's a... Run with the pistol, man.
[06:28.46]Try and get one kill with the pistol so you don't have to waste money.
[06:30.77]I've tried that several times.
[06:35.57]I'm just awful at this game.
[06:38.01]Right now.
[06:38.53]Right now, anyways.
[06:39.37]Don't be so down on yourself.
[06:40.91]You know what?
[06:41.25]You're right.
[06:43.89]I'm just, I'm gonna throw this bomb over here.
[06:48.05]Now they can't come over here.
[06:49.51]Actually, that pretty much did absolutely nothing.
[06:51.61]I don't know why it did that.
[06:54.92]I'll shoot you through the barrels, you bastard.
[06:57.26]Oh, what?
[06:58.08]Oh, that again.
[06:59.08]Who killed that guy?
[06:59.94]I didn't kill him.
[07:02.42]You're the only one alive.
[07:03.44]Oh, come on, no.
[07:04.02]Oh, I, there's two others alive.
[07:05.72]One other alive.
[07:07.08]Damn.
[07:09.86]This guy's trying to get, like, a wallbang.
[07:11.58]It's not even shooting at people.
[07:12.44]Alright, let's go EG Reptile.
[07:14.50]I'm pressing E. If we both press E at the same time, we might be able to override his command.
[07:21.68]Let's see if he can do it.
[07:22.38]Yeah, throw that grenade.
[07:27.02]He's all smoked out right now.
[07:28.44]He's in trouble.
[07:32.56]Oh!
[07:36.78]Oh my god!
[07:37.56]Oh my god, this guy's gonna do it.
[07:42.12]He like, had that.
[07:43.74]He really did.
[07:44.92]I have to say something, I have to say.
[07:46.90]Damn.
[07:50.79]Alright, give me that Kevlar and helmet and no money for anything else.
[07:54.93]You're just rolling around with Kevlar and helmet in the default?
[07:57.77]Mhm.
[07:58.87]Well at least you'll live.
[08:01.05]I'm starting out with zero dollars each round.
[08:03.45]You might live longer.
[08:07.08]This guy said, I don't miss.
[08:08.22]Okay, bullseye.
[08:12.00]I missed.
[08:13.04]Okay, Carlos Farrell from Phone Booth.
[08:16.30]Oh, I just got flashed.
[08:19.26]Jeez, I'm like afraid.
[08:20.74]This game scares me.
[08:22.65]Playing against bots, I'm all calm, but I can't even aim when I see a person.
[08:26.77]Grenade out.
[08:28.07]It's just me again versus five people.
[08:31.77]Do I have a grenade?
[08:32.35]I do.
[08:32.91]Eat it.
[08:35.82]I rolled like a foot in front of him.
[08:37.70]I didn't really.
[08:39.56]I pretty much grenade blew myself up.
[08:44.24]Damn, this other team is whooping our ass.
