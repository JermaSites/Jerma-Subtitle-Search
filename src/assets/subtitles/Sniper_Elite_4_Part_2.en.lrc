[00:55.63]Yeah.
[01:03.36]Hey.
[01:06.94]Give me a minute.
[01:10.92]Sniper Elite 4.
[01:11.52]We're going to play it a little bit tonight.
[01:13.66]You know.
[01:15.83]We're here.
[01:18.91]You know.
[01:19.93]Sniper Elite 4 is the game we're going to be playing tonight.
[01:25.95]I still have to fix another fucking dog.
[01:27.49]Alright, give me one minute.
[01:34.36]I gotta get the game open and stuff.
[01:37.06]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[01:39.56]Three minutes.
[01:41.10]Ten minutes.
[01:42.26]One minute.
[01:48.94]Wait, what?
[02:15.51]Even when the stream is live it's still late No guys guys guys, this is a soft 7
[02:24.93]You understand?
[02:26.01]My stream, I'm a soft 7.
[02:28.41]You understand?
[02:34.37]I'm not a hard 7.
[02:36.27]I'm a soft 7.
[02:41.44]Pizza stream.
[02:42.32]Alright.
[02:48.34]Oh, by the way, welcome our newest mod to the table.
[02:52.76]Everyone say hello to our newest mod, Will Sarcasm.
[02:57.86]Will, welcome to the mod team.
[03:03.38]Don't abuse your power, or I will be very upset.
[03:08.73]Why isn't the sun in the middle?
[03:09.89]Because the moon is the center of the universe.
[03:14.87]I mean, all you have to do is go to simple grade school to know that the moon is the center of the fucking universe.
[03:22.76]You know?
[03:27.83]Alright, let me move this.
[03:29.07]Let's get Sniper Elite going.
[03:31.49]Close your ears, by the way.
[03:33.79]This shit's gonna be loud again, because this game... Every video game that ever existed, all their splash screens... You know what?
[03:40.15]Let's talk about this.
[03:41.27]You know what?
[03:41.85]I thought that was Let's Talk.
[03:44.51]No.
[03:45.84]This is the Let's Talk picture.
[03:48.44]Right?
[03:49.18]When you see this picture, that means we're gonna talk about something.
[03:53.02]Why does every single video game splash screen?
[03:58.32]It's always at 1000% volume.
[04:01.52]Always.
[04:02.78]Even when you drop it.
[04:05.24]In the menu.
[04:06.85]It's like they have a separate audio cue.
[04:10.03]People need to stop doing that shit.
[04:11.27]Like, for instance, your eardrums are going to hurt in five seconds.
[04:15.59]Five, four, three, two, one.
[04:22.22]See, like, what is this?
[04:24.88]Why?
[04:26.52]The game volume is turned way down.
[04:29.40]Like, come on, fucking Nintendo.
[04:31.26]Get with the program.
[04:32.36]Look, the game crashed, by the way.
[04:36.46]Uh... No, it didn't.
[04:41.30]Why is the dog talking again?
[04:47.41]Why is my whole computer is crashing?
[04:51.22]What in the name of God is happening right now?
[04:58.96]Okay, I think it's because the game is loading.
[05:00.98]This is really weird.
[05:01.72]This is like freaking me out at the moment.
[05:06.17]Okay.
[05:10.29]Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[05:13.35]Already made the tweet.
[05:14.34]Single player.
[05:14.92]We're just going to continue the campaign.
[05:18.39]And we ended up here at Little Reno Dockyard.
[05:20.51]Let me just take off my jacket.
[05:24.61]This is on PC, yes.
[05:26.91]Did anybody even ask that question?
[05:29.79]I don't think anybody even asked.
[05:31.17]Why did I say that?
[05:32.55]Oh yeah, this is on PC, yes.
[05:35.07]A guy that didn't even ask that question.
[05:42.75]Oh, my little dog's down here.
[05:43.65]Hold on, I'm going to see if the little dog wants to stay in here or not.
[05:47.89]Wait, what?
[05:48.89]I'm going to put the dog upstairs.
[05:51.10]We'll start in about two seconds here.
[05:58.30]Beer.
[06:13.30]Thank you.
[07:17.58]Auto or we riot.
[07:20.34]No, I don't want him to stay down here.
[07:25.93]Should I even take the same weapon I had last time?
[07:29.07]I feel like that weapon sucks.
[07:30.96]And I run out of ammo in two seconds.
[07:32.94]Wait, what?
[07:36.82]I think I'm just going to keep using it.
[07:41.26]By the way, thank you to Squeaking Hiccups for the six bucks.
[07:44.51]Say sup, Jerma.
[07:45.23]What's up, Squeaking Hiccups?
[07:47.63]Beer.
[07:50.65]I'll keep using it.
[07:51.39]Just don't be a fucking idiot.
[07:53.03]I got three bucks.
[07:54.94]Let's just go.
[07:57.68]How'd the Easy Mac spaghetti go yesterday?
[08:02.32]I used a little too much milk and it was watery and gross.
[08:06.81]It was my bad.
[08:13.71]What were we doing here?
[08:17.41]This is where we skip every single cutscene.
[08:19.15]I forgot.
[08:19.43]I got a real creepy fucking voice.
[08:28.02]Did that guy inhale helium before he talked to me?
[08:32.38]What the fuck is that?
[08:35.48]What is this dude?
[08:41.98]Nothing on your mind.
[08:44.16]I do like that each one of these people gives you a mission.
[08:47.24]I don't know.
[08:47.56]A lot of side missions.
[08:57.57]Let me get a piece of that chocolate.
[09:00.68]It was my father's.
[09:01.84]It was my father's chocolate.
[09:04.56]Beer.
[09:06.06]Okay, who cares.
[09:10.08]Let's go snipe people.
[09:15.55]Beer.
[09:22.34]Hey, you won't be able to watch my streams while you're at boot camp.
[09:26.40]Thanks for the vids, bro.
[09:31.50]Take care, man.
[09:32.74]Boot camp, man.
[09:33.90]That's... Gonna be in the military.
[09:37.28]Military man.
[09:38.31]Military man or woman.
[09:39.27]Whoever you are.
[09:41.23]Well, good luck to you.
[09:41.77]Alright.
[09:45.41]Wait, there's a guy already... That guy was just sleeping.
[09:51.37]That guy was just sleeping.
[09:53.47]No.
[09:53.58]No.
[09:53.98]No.
[09:57.43]No.
[10:00.45]No.
[10:01.45]Wait.
[10:02.57]Just wait.
[10:04.49]Give me a minute, guys.
[10:05.53]This is fairly... This is fairly important.
[10:08.59]He's reading a book.
[10:09.75]Oh, God.
[10:10.69]He's reading a book.
[10:11.31]This is just like from the movies, except he's not in a gorilla costume.
[10:17.31]Hey, look.
[10:20.76]Gorilla reading a book.
[10:25.82]I better be careful.
[10:33.60]Oh, God.
[10:35.32]Wait.
[10:38.87]A hundred bucks from Nairo.
[10:41.43]Nairo gave money yesterday, I believe, too.
[10:44.27]But, Nairo.
[10:46.31]A hundred dollars, and he says, Kevin said dinner's on him.
[10:51.72]This whole... Thanks a lot, Kevin.
[10:52.58]Not a hundred dollars, dude.
[11:00.19]That's crazy.
[11:02.11]What a great timing for... Alright.
[11:04.11]$100 joke?
[11:06.25]Okay, you got it.
[11:08.69]Anytime somebody gives $100, it has to be a $100 joke.
[11:11.34]It's very important, you know?
[11:13.60]I'll show you what that $100 joke is going to be, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:15.66]Please prepare yourself for the $100 joke.
[11:17.00]It's going to take a little bit of prep work.
[11:21.55]It is.
[11:22.37]But it'll be worth it.
[11:33.93]This is gonna take some prep work.
[11:41.76]Just give you a moment.
[11:49.02]This wasn't the joke.
[11:50.42]That wasn't it, that wasn't it.
[11:53.06]Okay, here we go.
[11:56.75]This is the type of quality humor you can expect.
[12:01.65]For 100 bucks.
[12:09.55]Somebody gave $10.
[12:11.97]Squeaking hiccups says I'm too broke to make it rain $100 bills, but I can make it rain with small change.
[12:15.99]Well, squeaking hiccups.
[12:16.72]Don't ever feel obligated to do that.
[12:18.38]What's this guy doing?
[12:20.04]I guess he's throwing up.
[12:21.66]Hold on.
[12:21.90]No, he has to be sitting.
[12:22.46]Go back and read the book.
[12:26.02]Why did he get up?
[12:29.73]I have to do my $100 joke.
[12:30.83]This guy got up.
[12:34.59]I want him to be reading the book and the body just to fall in front of him.
[12:38.05]He'll go back and sit down.
[12:38.77]Just give me a minute.
[12:43.35]Oh, for the love of God.
[12:44.05]You know what?
[12:44.69]Joke's over.
[12:52.17]Why is he scared of that?
[12:56.25]Okay.
[12:57.89]Alright.
[12:59.29]That's enough.
[13:07.30]Great joke.
[13:08.10]Don't worry.
[13:09.02]I'll get... Oh, God damn it.
[13:12.12]I don't want to have to do this again.
[13:13.90]Go get a refund.
[13:24.15]Alright, fuck it.
[13:26.13]Go, go, go, go, go.
[13:27.65]It's like it never happened.
[13:30.23]The joke is my gameplay?
[13:32.73]Okay, perfect.
[13:33.83]Now here's the joke.
[13:35.77]This is the $100 joke you're gonna get.
[13:37.37]It will be worth it.
[13:38.18]You ready?
[13:38.40]This is what you paid for.
[14:05.89]Into the fire.
[14:06.57]Oh, that would have been a hundred bucks.
[14:07.73]That would have been a hundred dollar joke right there.
[14:09.79]Okay, there you go.
[14:14.31]Let's just go.
[14:19.89]Sneak increase to 45.
[14:21.01]Hundred dollar joke.
[14:38.88]Wait, what just happened?
[14:41.06]What is he doing?
[14:51.51]I can't get me out of this.
[14:52.91]Just fucking play the game already.
[14:55.03]Why do I keep doing this shit?
[14:59.46]Alright, let's just... I told you, when you give me something to do, I don't stop.
[15:10.03]Okay.
[15:11.59]So.
[15:13.11]Disable searchlights.
[15:14.25]Destroy guns.
[15:16.63]Disable to destroy.
[15:17.71]Disable searchlights.
[15:18.65]There's a lot of random shit to do here apparently.
[15:20.79]Find out what the Germans are transporting.
[15:26.97]Let's locate the intel.
[15:27.85]I'm here.
[15:28.55]I'm literally right here.
[15:29.41]So let's do that first.
[15:33.53]Let's take a look at the binoculars.
[15:34.63]See if we can get anybody.
[15:35.41]There's a guy right there.
[15:37.37]Spot this guy.
[15:41.45]Just stealth melee him.
[15:42.59]No, I'm not going that way.
[15:45.41]Oh, this guy's easy enough.
[15:51.11]Anybody understand what just happened right there?
[15:57.08]I shot that guy with a fake bullet, apparently.
[16:01.74]I legit shot that guy directly in his face and it didn't do anything.
[16:04.36]Okay.
[16:05.44]Fine.
[16:10.25]Who can see me?
[16:10.75]You guys in the truck?
[16:13.53]Cover below.
[16:14.25]Hold on.
[16:15.35]That's fine.
[16:15.69]I want to shoot the guy in the truck so bad.
[16:40.99]Got it!
[16:44.35]Did it get the guy next to him too?
[16:49.55]Come on!
[16:50.89]There's no penetration with this thing.
[16:57.22]Where'd he go?
[17:00.06]Is there a guy above me?
[17:04.90]There there is.
[17:12.11]He's up there.
[17:13.53]Let's wrap around.
[17:17.26]Get wrecked.
[17:17.94]I only have such little ammo.
[17:24.62]It's Hitman all over again.
[17:25.70]I know, I can't help it.
[17:27.84]But... Why is there somebody shooting?
[17:32.56]Nobody can even see me right now.
[17:36.01]Can you tell?
[17:36.37]Who's like... I don't understand.
[17:38.21]Oh, it's this guy.
[17:42.83]I just blew up his helmet Do I know it's a stealth game?
[17:53.86]Hey, whatever you want.
[17:56.20]Oh Whatever you want it to be, right?
[18:00.52]It's an open-ended game Is this like Hitman?
[18:06.62]I mean yeah, it sure is Can you do this in Hitman though?
[18:10.72]I don't think so
[18:17.23]The quest for a better joke.
[18:19.09]This guy is just running around in circles.
[18:32.92]I think I knew where I was.
[18:35.54]Yeah, I'll take that intel, boys and girls.
[18:42.23]What do you think?
[18:48.66]Alright.
[18:48.96]Now we can be stealthy.
[18:52.48]We'll just do some save scumming right here and we'll be stealthy.
[18:59.62]They don't know where I am.
[19:00.88]In the building.
[19:01.38]We'll do some melee stealth kills.
[19:03.53]Get ourselves back on track.
[19:06.73]Get my rocks out.
[19:07.47]I'm going to need them.
[19:10.57]I'm going to be a guy right here.
[19:11.47]There's a lot of people in here actually.
[19:20.02]Let's take a look.
[19:21.02]Peek around the corner.
[19:21.60]Got one guy right there.
[19:23.82]Alright, we're going to just be really... Okay.
[19:28.58]That was a pretty good stealth kill.
[19:34.99]Okay, now they're all distracted.
[19:37.43]Sprint over here.
[19:40.67]Got it.
[19:44.73]Couple people over that way distracted.
[19:46.21]They're distracted.
[19:46.77]Okay, one guy going to come in the boxcar.
[19:52.30]Easy.
[19:53.93]Into the boxcar.
[19:54.99]Here he comes.
[19:58.71]Not quite.
[19:59.91]Where is he?
[20:01.29]No, they're searching over there.
[20:03.01]Nice.
[20:04.60]Doing well.
[20:08.60]Trying to look good on easy.
[20:09.54]This is not easy.
[20:10.24]This is not normal.
[20:12.36]Don't ever accuse me of being on easy.
[20:35.74]This ain't on easy.
[20:37.94]This is on slightly easy.
[20:42.97]Okay.
[20:57.14]So far so good.
[20:58.50]There's the intel.
[21:01.68]Slightly easy.
[21:02.48]Yeah, this is slightly easy mode.
[21:04.05]This isn't easy mode.
[21:10.12]When this guy comes around the corner, I'll just poke him right in the face.
[21:21.12]Nice.
[21:22.06]It took three shots, but I got him.
[21:29.80]The ammo.
[21:33.08]Where's the intel?
[21:36.59]Is it up top?
[21:43.33]Where's the intelligence?
[21:50.47]Ooh!
[21:52.95]Talking about easy mode.
[21:56.84]Easy mode.
[21:57.42]That was right in his head.
[22:01.40]Ooh, I broke his back on the... Okay, good.
[22:05.04]Nice job.
[22:05.35]There's the intel.
[22:05.89]Oh, it's just a bag.
[22:08.31]Just a backpack.
[22:16.69]These soldiers are so bad.
[22:22.26]My cat is watching me?
[22:23.88]Your cat is watching me.
[22:24.92]What does your cat think?
[22:30.20]Does your cat think I'm cool?
[22:36.12]Wait!
[22:38.36]Holy shit!
[22:41.71]Alright, well, I just broke through the window and killed him.
[22:48.51]Easy mode?
[22:48.85]It's not easy.
[22:49.35]This is not on easy mode.
[22:54.03]You want me to prove it to you?
[22:54.95]I can prove it to you.
[22:57.03]Use the code.
[22:58.65]Got it from the officer, right?
[23:01.97]There's the intel.
[23:02.59]Ooh, wait.
[23:04.57]What was that?
[23:05.55]Damn.
[23:06.37]See how much damage this thing does?
[23:10.43]Holy shit.
[23:11.41]This thing's going to be insane.
[23:13.85]Okay.
[23:14.93]So now...
[23:17.54]Uh, what's the actual... Okay, shipment's being sent to Alagra.
[23:22.06]Find out what the Germans are transporting and disable to destroy the harbor air defenses.
[23:26.26]So, there's one right here.
[23:30.91]Let's go take care of that, then.
[23:36.59]Now I'm gonna just go blast this guy.
[23:48.56]I feel like that was lag.
[23:49.67]I shot him right in the head and then it took like 500 milliseconds for him to do a backflip.
[23:56.41]Anybody else feel that way?
[23:57.23]Okay, let's stand up.
[24:01.33]How do I get out of here the fastest way?
[24:02.74]This way.
[24:05.76]Out.
[24:08.94]Please come to Gamescom.
[24:11.90]I actually want to do a lot of traveling this year.
[24:14.72]I want to go to like DreamHack.
[24:15.99]I want to do...
[24:17.44]All the Paxes, I want to go to E3.
[24:18.76]I want to do it all this year, you know?
[24:21.46]Wow, what am I thinking?
[24:22.40]Don't just walk out into everybody.
[24:25.98]Save it.
[24:30.73]Lag in single player.
[24:31.85]There's a lot of people here.
[24:34.43]Fuck, I have to actually be stealthy.
[24:37.35]Oh no, this guy's just... Who is that?! !
[24:41.64]I think I see a person over there.
[24:44.88]Maybe not.
[24:45.96]I was trying to shoot him in the fucking head.
[24:54.07]Come on.
[24:56.87]I was trying to shoot that guy in the face.
[24:59.53]And I did.
[25:00.12]And it just... Fuck it.
[25:05.18]Fuck it.
[25:06.18]You know what?
[25:06.62]Fuck it.
[25:11.87]Climb up.
[25:13.15]Yep.
[25:13.65]That's what 007 James Bond would have done.
[25:17.42]I'm right there.
[25:18.64]Check this out.
[25:19.82]This is what 007 James Bond would do.
[25:21.48]I thought there was a guy up there.
[25:29.02]This is what 007 would do.
[25:32.31]And then you go like this.
[25:47.14]That's what James Bond would have done.
[25:50.84]I'm being shot at from so many places.
[25:53.09]James Bond!
[25:53.91]Back down!
[26:05.29]I thought I was going to slide.
[26:09.82]Alright, this time, can we please not have... Remember this one?
[26:15.33]Oh, I see somebody over there.
[26:16.99]Hey guys, when in doubt, just fucking sprint.
[26:30.64]James Bond, everybody.
[26:52.96]There's- there's gold!
[26:56.73]Woohoo!
[26:59.27]Woohoo!
[27:21.49]Jesus!
[27:22.63]Who's whistling?
[27:30.27]It's up there.
[27:30.85]I guess I do have to climb up.
[27:38.17]No, no I don't.
[27:39.01]Okay.
[27:42.81]No witnesses?
[27:43.89]Not necessarily.
[27:46.63]Are they up here?
[27:51.40]I have no clue.
[27:52.28]I think there's gotta be, like, one or two people sitting on that, like, searchlight, right?
[27:56.06]No?
[27:56.81]I think I'm in the clear.
[27:57.87]Yeah.
[27:58.99]Alright, let's turn this off.
[28:02.71]It was that easy, apparently.
[28:04.19]Alright, where's the next one?
[28:08.53]Uh, this is not part of the mission, so who cares?
[28:13.33]We're going this way.
[28:14.09]We're gonna turn around.
[28:16.03]Continue that way.
[28:21.95]Let's drop right here.
[28:22.79]I'm a horror movie serial killer.
[28:26.40]Why?
[28:27.88]Because I'm whistling?
[28:32.70]Now, let's take out some people tactically.
[28:34.52]Ah, there's a sniper.
[28:36.78]This is where we're going to separate the easy from the normal, you know what I'm saying?
[28:42.34]Yeah, separate the easy from the normal.
[28:43.94]Oh, he's on easy.
[28:45.16]Yeah, didn't even know I could do that, did you?
[28:58.06]That was a long shot.
[29:02.19]Who else?
[29:04.03]What the fuck?
[29:31.88]Honest to God.
[29:39.73]Well, okay.
[29:40.49]Whoops.
[29:46.95]Hey, gamers.
[29:51.43]I just, I did not think I was going to just leap off into the fucking water.
[29:57.82]Where's this guy?
[30:00.80]I don't want you fucking this up for me.
[30:01.98]Where'd you go?
[30:04.62]Ah, you're worthless.
[30:05.40]Who cares?
[30:07.10]See?
[30:07.30]Like, this is what I wanted to do.
[30:08.64]It's like that.
[30:09.29]Even though I hurt myself real bad, it's okay.
[30:22.04]Hey, gamers.
[30:25.36]There he is.
[30:27.54]Shit.
[30:37.73]I spend every day with him.
[30:38.87]He's lame.
[30:41.87]What's that, Kim?
[30:42.99]What?
[30:43.57]What?
[30:46.78]Oh yeah, Kim says I'm lame, huh?
[30:48.44]Would a lame guy be able to do something like this?
[30:53.72]Would a lame guy be able to do this?
[30:54.76]Right in the shin?
[31:01.10]I don't think so.
[31:03.74]Please turn aim assist off.
[31:05.66]I will if you want me to not progress the game.
[31:20.59]Can I just get this shit out?
[31:21.55]Wait, hold on.
[31:23.49]This is important.
[31:26.85]Fucking machine gun at me over here.
[31:37.52]Bet you can't do that in person.
[31:40.99]What, you don't think I'd be able to do that in person?
[31:46.33]No, I couldn't.
[31:46.93]That's why it's a video game.
[31:49.27]There are so many people behind me.
[31:51.85]What a deal.
[32:02.37]Take care of these guys real quick in this stealth game.
[32:05.39]Not a big deal.
[32:07.55]Oh, I'm almost out of ammo.
[32:11.47]It's all good.
[32:12.79]Just gotta get up there.
[32:14.45]Where is this guy?
[32:18.94]Oh, you're right there.
[32:24.70]Right through the neck cavity.
[32:29.51]I need bullets, though.
[32:30.89]Equipment in the radial menu.
[32:32.01]What are you talking about?
[32:33.03]I know how to use the radial menu.
[32:34.19]Why are you telling me how to use the radial menu?
[32:40.94]Grenades and shit.
[32:41.74]Oh, there's a lot of stuff here.
[32:42.74]They're refilling me.
[32:45.76]Uh, yeah.
[32:47.16]I will definitely take that.
[32:50.67]Cool.
[32:51.57]Okay.
[32:52.49]We're good.
[32:53.33]Ow!
[32:53.45]Ow!
[32:56.88]Seriously.
[32:57.24]Alright, officer down.
[33:03.30]Let's reload this and get some more ammo for it.
[33:12.04]Is that the only ammo I can take?
[33:13.10]Apparently.
[33:15.46]Yeah, I guess so.
[33:22.81]Whatever.
[33:25.68]What do you have on you?
[33:26.84]Anything useful?
[33:30.56]I guess not.
[33:32.00]Well, now I have the option to do it.
[33:38.01]Guess I grabbed everything useful.
[33:39.59]I'm going to fight Yhorm the Giant.
[33:45.23]Here they come.
[33:49.21]Oh, here come the people that are gonna try to stop me from doing this.
[33:53.07]It's alright.
[33:53.51]Cause I'm good.
[33:58.59]Alright, no aim assist?
[34:05.76]I can do no aim assist if you want.
[34:07.94]Although, not going to be very good.
[34:15.02]Got him.
[34:18.50]Okay.
[34:20.16]How many more of these do I need?
[34:23.63]I gotta do the three down here and then this one right here.
[34:27.36]Locate shipments.
[34:29.16]Sure thing.
[34:31.98]Jeremy's fucking getting toasted by me.
[34:33.54]Why are you toasting me in the chat?
[34:37.44]Why am I being toasted right now?
[34:39.93]What did I do?
[34:40.51]I don't deserve any toasting.
[34:48.01]Ain't no bread.
[34:52.74]The power of boners?
[34:54.28]What the fuck are you talking about, man?
[34:58.98]Yeah, I don't need aim assist when I have the Razer Death- OH!
[35:02.12]There's a lot of people in this room that are all running after me.
[35:14.59]Shit.
[35:19.25]Why do they all freak out when I can- this is ridiculous.
[35:26.46]Just push him into the water.
[35:31.47]Bread boner.
[35:32.91]Check this out.
[35:33.65]This is how you get in.
[35:36.07]Yep.
[35:37.87]And we dive behind this.
[35:40.05]James Bond would fucking be so proud of me.
[35:42.20]Watch this.
[35:45.84]James Bond would be proud of this one.
[35:55.79]See, that's what you do.
[35:56.55]You blow the door and everyone freaks the fuck out and tries to go to the door.
[35:58.85]That's what James Bond would... See, then they all come around this way to... Where the fuck am I?
[36:17.91]No, I'm okay.
[36:21.69]James Bond looks like a coward.
[36:34.35]Hey, gamers.
[36:35.05]Alright, no more fucking around.
[36:38.17]I'm gonna actually do this the way I'm supposed to do it.
[36:40.57]And that's sit here and wait until they stop being on high alert.
[36:51.03]Why are they all coming down here?
[36:54.41]This doesn't make any sense.
[36:55.25]What the fuck are they all pouring down here for?
[36:56.85]You know what I mean?
[37:00.77]Why are you here?
[37:07.69]Why are you here?
[37:09.29]What the fuck is this doing here?
[37:10.71]Hold on, that's the headshot.
[37:14.02]That's the headshot right there.
[37:20.94]Why did it stop?
[37:21.60]Come on, I want to headshot this thing.
[37:31.31]I don't even understand, like, where the, like, where...
[37:38.40]What the fuck is happening?
[37:41.90]Who is shooting right now?
[37:43.92]There's nobody with a gun.
[37:49.50]This is seriously freaking me out.
[37:56.39]Okay, now they're gonna all pour this way for some reason.
[37:59.07]I mean, I know it's on alert right now, but seriously, what?
[38:03.77]Why is it this ridiculous?
[38:07.92]Now it's not happening.
[38:10.10]Okay.
[38:13.27]I don't... I don't think I had... No, no.
[38:15.23]Here they come.
[38:15.65]Okay.
[38:15.87]I'm just gonna hide.
[38:22.91]Fuck it.
[38:25.58]They all end up coming this way.
[38:26.56]They're both gonna go which way?
[38:27.82]That way and... Both going that way.
[38:33.54]Let's do this right.
[38:36.89]Why the fuck is the tank here?
[38:38.87]I don't... This tank wasn't here before.
[38:46.99]The tank just rolls up now.
[38:51.75]Why?
[38:53.72]What the fuck does the tank roll up for?
[38:57.82]Why is everything so... Why is everything red?
[39:05.85]You two, like, of all the dumb fucking people, like, really?
[39:09.00]You're gonna let me get away with this?
[39:37.67]Let's do it.
[39:40.35]Now, I'm going... Okay.
[39:41.75]Because of the situation that I have here, right?
[39:44.67]I'm restarting at the checkpoint.
[39:46.71]And it's just red and people are just sprinting over here.
[39:54.46]This is the shit I was talking about yesterday with the restart checkpoint stuff.
[39:59.36]Why do you put me here?
[40:01.22]Why do you put me at restart checkpoint?
[40:04.72]In the middle of a red high alert.
[40:07.48]And I can't fucking go anywhere or do anything.
[40:09.50]I have to sit here.
[40:14.71]Look.
[40:15.65]Why is this a checkpoint?
[40:18.05]This shouldn't be a checkpoint.
[40:36.63]He's really selling the death adder to me.
[40:43.20]Complaint.
[40:44.52]Did they all just run over here?
[40:52.80]I don't want this to be my checkpoint.
[40:58.98]I don't think the devs expected you to sprint through the level.
[41:01.74]I haven't really sprinted through the level.
[41:08.00]Regardless of how fast I'm going through the level, if you're going to have a checkpoint system in the game, shouldn't it put you in a place where you could kind of start over and do it again?
[41:18.07]Rather than it's just permanently red and people are sprinting around everywhere.
[41:24.85]Because I have to just sit here.
[41:28.76]I have to sit here until the computer decides to stop popping question marks all over my screen.
[41:37.71]I'm not even over there.
[41:44.28]Everyone's just so confused over there.
[41:48.00]I have nothing to do with... Look it.
[41:49.02]I have nothing to do with their confusion.
[41:51.52]Something... Like somebody dropped a glass in that room.
[41:55.26]Or like a fucking... A dog got loose in there.
[41:58.01]That's what's going on in there.
[41:58.99]I'm not even over there.
[42:01.75]Whose dog is this?
[42:05.19]Okay.
[42:05.29]Okay.
[42:10.25]Save it right here.
[42:18.11]Why are they all running out here?
[42:25.10]Let me guess.
[42:25.70]The tank's going to roll up, too.
[42:28.98]They always run... No.
[42:30.36]Oh, goddammit.
[42:31.14]Please don't even see.
[42:32.04]Ah!
[42:38.83]This is getting real dumb.
[42:44.29]Just hide in here.
[42:48.95]You're triangulated.
[42:50.49]Yeah, I'm triangulated over there.
[42:52.62]Look at the mini-map.
[42:55.20]That's where they have the triangulation.
[42:58.28]I'm just in the permanent red zone.
[43:01.58]Dude, I'm just in the permanent red zone.
[43:03.36]Yo, man, I feel like the Patriots.
[43:05.74]You know what I'm saying?
[43:06.54]I feel like the Patriots right now.
[43:09.40]Just permanently in the red zone like the Super Bowl.
[43:12.11]You know what I'm saying?
[43:14.17]Woo-hoo-hoo!
[43:16.05]There's the tank.
[43:16.59]Fuck.
[43:26.38]Will this please go by?
[43:32.08]Is this going to park in here?
[43:36.23]Wow, it's not red anymore.
[43:37.65]What a miracle.
[43:40.56]That one's for free.
[43:46.68]I'm saving it right here.
[43:47.86]I'm not dealing with that shit again.
[43:49.18]Even if I have to restart the checkpoint, the checkpoint's awful.
[43:51.56]I can at least come right here.
[43:57.15]Whoa!
[43:59.05]Hey, Quentin.
[43:59.55]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[44:00.35]Best joke all night.
[44:04.12]Thank you, Harlan, for the 10 bucks, 1,000 bits.
[44:06.55]Thanks a lot, man.
[44:11.51]I need to go in here.
[44:14.65]So... We're going to have to do some real sneaking.
[44:21.20]Okay, this is where the rocks are going to come in handy.
[44:24.59]I fucking didn't want to whistle.
[44:25.74]I wanted a rock.
[44:26.44]I wanted a rock.
[44:27.04]I wanted a rock.

[44:30.54]I wanted a rock.
[44:32.82]Oh, fucking whatever.
[44:39.62]Let's pretend that didn't happen.

[45:23.04]Everybody heard the rock.
[45:24.15]I threw the rock over at a bush over there.
[45:25.89]And people behind a brick wall heard it.
[45:27.23]Hey, somebody threw a rock!
[45:30.97]Oh boy, I heard that through the fucking... I'm sitting on the can right now and I heard a rock outside.
[45:35.57]Alright.
[45:49.36]Who's he?
[45:49.63]Is there anybody up here?
[45:52.59]No.
[45:56.21]I need to be in this building.
[45:57.23]Locate the shipments.
[45:59.09]So I gotta go down.
[46:03.01]Save scum.
[46:05.25]Just call me a scumbag.
[46:06.41]I don't even care.

[46:14.62]But good luck because there's a ton of people.
[46:16.62]I wonder, can I... This is silenced, right?
[46:18.68]Alright, I gotta have good aim here.
[46:29.07]I hit him in the head twice, so don't worry.

[47:30.12]Oh.
[47:36.33]Come on.
[47:37.91]Get up here.
[47:38.29]Look, we both can't do this all day, you know.
[47:46.12]One of us eventually is gonna have to make a move and be seen.
[47:56.74]God damn it.
[48:01.58]Oh my god.
[48:02.30]Just stand up and shoot him.
[48:05.14]Jeez.

[48:14.22]No!
[48:16.26]I killed him.
[48:17.80]No, I didn't.
[48:22.42]I just scared the shit out of him.
[48:24.04]Shootout of the year.
[48:32.59]What a fucking lame shootout.
[48:34.85]That was so bad.
[48:35.85]Alright, you got like a fucking... Somebody pulled the alarm or something?
[48:42.11]What's this?
[48:42.43]I don't know.
[48:46.20]What's the next primary objective?
[48:49.58]Okay, so we got one here.
[48:54.12]Disable the searchlight.
[48:54.96]We'll do that first.
[48:58.15]Can I kick through this door?
[48:59.11]That was such an awful vault.
[49:06.12]You could have done a better vault than that, man.
[49:07.68]Like, really.
[49:10.64]Let's go up there.
[49:11.84]176 meters that way.
[49:14.98]Won't be long now.
[49:15.60]I'm going to take the route over the house.
[49:21.81]Put it back in the house.
[49:25.67]Now I can use my sniping skills.
[49:28.56]If I do this one right, I'm gonna track some people, tag them.
[49:36.38]I hear the scary music is playing now.
[49:39.44]I'm not sure why.
[49:42.69]Why is scary music playing?
[49:47.23]I don't know.
[49:50.53]There's one more guy over there, no?
[49:57.39]Might as well just tag it.
[49:58.71]Okay.
[49:59.49]Alright, let's use the sniping skills.
[50:00.95]We're gonna go one.
[50:02.25]Bingo.
[50:05.97]Before anybody has any chance to react, we're gonna go one, two.
[50:09.33]Two tagged guys right here.
[50:11.45]Bingo.
[50:13.31]Right through the window.
[50:15.51]Got to the right.
[50:16.23]We're gonna get this guy right in his shin.
[50:19.75]Got it.
[50:21.01]And then right into his jugular vein.
[50:27.71]And that should be enough.
[50:30.11]Hit him in the same spot every time.
[50:31.98]You know what I mean?
[50:33.54]And that should be it.
[50:34.64]Now we can safely...
[51:06.65]OK.
[51:06.75]I sent you down slow.
[51:35.58]I want this guy to move.
[51:36.92]Oh, fuck it.
[51:37.42]Whatever.
[51:37.70]I'm going this way.
[51:40.84]I'm an impatient man.
[51:42.84]What did I do wrong?
[51:44.36]I took out the main threats.
[51:50.41]I'm supposed to go in this building.
[52:03.53]Yeah.
[52:06.36]Didn't expect me to be right behind you, did you?
[52:09.66]No, you didn't.
[52:12.32]That revolver's not silenced.
[52:13.60]I know, I know.
[52:14.92]I'm gonna do this again.
[52:16.37]I'm gonna just go in the building.
[52:19.95]Fucking god game.
[52:20.97]Why the fuck would you make a checkpoint right here?
[52:27.61]Why can't, like, back where, when I first got, why is there a checkpoint here?
[52:33.03]Why the fuck is it, why did it put me here?
[52:36.54]I'm fucked.
[52:37.30]I'm so screwed.
[52:38.32]I didn't save the game here.
[52:44.67]Oh my god.
[52:45.55]Oh, looks like you're in the middle of some shit right now, son.
[52:52.35]Let's go ahead and make a checkpoint for you right there.
[52:58.15]Son of a fuck, man.
[53:01.01]Did I make it into where I need to be?
[53:05.88]No.
[53:06.80]I'm supposed to be over here.
[53:09.39]Well, we're going to wrap around.
[53:10.19]I'm going to this one.
[53:10.91]We're going to wrap around.
[53:11.65]Because obviously this is causing too many problems.
[53:15.93]The game wants to put me in a position where I'm not able to do anything with checkpoint.
[53:19.51]So who's out here?
[53:23.66]There's like three people out here.
[53:25.66]Save it.
[53:34.22]Can I just destroy this?
[53:37.59]No.
[53:39.73]It's like two guys here.
[53:40.69]Are they up top?
[53:43.53]Where are these two guys?
[53:51.87]On the building?
[54:07.34]You know, I like really wish... Watch what happens.
[54:09.32]It's gonna put... Like, why is it... Okay, here's my theory.
[54:14.04]The game's checkpoint system is not actually any checkpoints.
[54:17.76]It's just auto-saving the game every five fucking seconds.
[54:22.37]That's what's happening.
[54:24.03]Sniper Elite 4's checkpoint system is, hey, we're gonna save the game every ten seconds, and whatever that last one was is your checkpoint.
[54:31.31]That's just the way it is.
[54:31.89]Apparently.
[54:33.29]Apparently.
[54:35.71]Don't ask me how or why, but that's what it is.
[54:40.84]You need to really fuck off, dude.
[54:42.38]Like, seriously.
[54:49.04]That was a double kill.
[54:52.16]I better see at least one PogChamp for that.
[54:58.24]See that reaction time?
[55:00.48]That's what happens when you're a fucking true 60 FPS gamer.
[55:08.85]This is on normal difficulty.
[55:10.97]Fucking hell, come on.
[55:15.15]I don't... I want to reload one of my saves, but... I'm in such a terrible position.
[55:27.14]Let's go this way.
[55:27.94]That was a sound.
[55:29.44]Oh my god.
[55:30.22]Oh my god, I hate you, game.
[55:38.91]Casual 60 FPS death.
[55:42.11]No, it's not my fault.
[55:43.27]Like, why is this guy over here?
[55:44.79]What the fuck are you doing over here?
[55:46.74]Whoa, I got scared of this guy.
[55:47.96]There's a person over here.
[55:49.04]Oh, my whole face is caved in now.
[55:52.34]Ow!
[55:54.50]Fuck you.
[55:55.16]Get out of here.
[55:55.78]There's no reason for that guy to be over here.
[55:58.15]I just completed an objective.
[56:02.29]Was it to kill the fucking random scared guy?
[56:09.87]Rage quit no no rage funny That's more like it How's this one?
[56:22.58]Okay, they come like I heard me picking up items This guy hurts me pick up a gun Wait a minute.
[56:33.06]Oh, wait a minute.
[56:34.04]There's there's 30 of us in this place everything useful
[56:38.36]There are 30 of us in here.
[56:40.20]I don't know.
[56:40.68]I heard somebody touch a gun in this room.
[56:43.46]Yeah.
[56:44.28]Uh-oh.
[56:44.70]We better line up.
[56:45.64]Get the whole cavalry in here.
[56:46.74]You search.
[56:47.44]I heard somebody pick up an item.
[56:49.10]Yeah, I did too.
[56:51.34]Could it have been one of the 40 people in this room?
[56:53.65]That's one of us?
[56:54.39]No, it couldn't be.
[56:55.61]There's just shit lying around everywhere.
[56:57.15]Who knows who could grab it?
[56:58.45]Just draw your gun's name.
[57:01.61]He's definitely in this room.
[57:05.82]You're a slide.
[57:07.06]I'll do a slide too.
[57:08.78]Yeah, you go in there first, Greg.
[57:10.48]I'll go in there first.
[57:11.12]I'll find him.
[57:12.66]He's right there.
[57:21.57]How do I get out of this ruck and rub?
[57:36.70]I'm just going to the top.
[57:38.32]See me at the top.
[57:39.74]What's that meme?
[57:42.32]Catch me outside.
[57:43.20]How does that sound, motherfucker?
[57:44.86]I wonder where the checkpoint's gonna be.
[57:51.64]Oh, yeah, right where I expected.
[57:53.02]Right where you get, like, playing hide and seek with these people.
[58:04.50]There he is again.
[58:13.27]Okay.
[58:15.77]Oh, okay.
[58:16.99]Somebody's searching.
[58:17.71]Here he comes.
[58:19.29]Yep.
[58:20.33]Now he can see me.
[58:22.98]Yep, there is a guy back here.
[58:25.90]There's something there.
[58:26.88]You should come look at it.
[58:27.70]Did that guy say he's hallucinating?
[58:35.33]These guys think they're hallucinating.
[58:37.51]What kind of fucking drugs are you guys taking in this base?
[58:43.54]I don't know.
[58:43.86]I think I might be hallucinating.
[58:48.94]Yeah, something tells me you're not hallucinating, man.
[58:51.66]This is very real right now.
[58:53.68]You're not hallucinating.
[58:56.37]Get the fuck out of here!
[59:01.35]What do I need to do in here?
[59:04.16]Oh god, there's a sniper right there.

[59:20.57]I don't suck.

[59:24.26]I'm gonna die.
[59:24.90]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:25.96]Heal.
[59:26.82]Full health.
[59:28.40]How does... This isn't... This isn't... This isn't normal!

[60:14.47]I'm fucking very good.
[60:15.41]I'm extremely good.
[60:24.32]Let's see where the checkpoint's gonna put me.
[60:26.84]What do you guys think?
[60:28.58]Hmm.
[60:30.84]Oh.
[60:31.46]This exact same spot again.
[60:33.86]Can't fucking wait.
[60:35.37]And you know what?
[60:36.45]Fuck it.
[60:37.37]I'm gonna go pee and we'll see what happens.
[60:39.29]I'll be right back.
[60:41.93]I'm gonna go pee.
[62:07.33]so so
[63:42.90]Dude, I'm convinced.
[63:44.84]I'm fucking convinced this game's not allowed to kill you.
[63:48.18]Unless you're moving.
[63:48.88]Let's see what happens if I take one step this way.
[63:59.53]Yeah, I'm not moving.
[64:00.43]Like, the game's not allowed to kill me.
[64:03.63]Like, this guy, randomly, is shooting me over and over again.
[64:06.55]He's gonna accidentally kill me.
[64:09.11]Yeah.
[64:14.70]Alright, let's go.
[64:15.38]Don't even give it a chance.
[64:16.48]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[64:19.88]This is not on easy mode.
[64:21.08]It's not.
[64:21.50]I swear to God.
[64:22.62]Look, you guys want me to prove myself?
[64:25.03]Difficulty.
[64:25.67]Look.
[64:26.71]We're fucking going on authentic.
[64:28.57]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[64:29.67]No, we're not.
[64:30.15]We're not doing that.
[64:31.71]We're not doing that.
[64:33.11]We're not doing that.
[64:35.81]We're not doing that.
[64:36.53]Just get me the fuck off.
[64:37.93]What are you... Why?
[64:41.86]Just hanging out there that guy was hanging out there for fun This is so bad like why the fuck did you put me here every time?
[65:00.29]Maybe if I put the difficulty up to normal here's the guy that's just seven a cigarette like right here.
[65:05.29]Oh
[65:09.41]Seriously.
[65:11.67]Everybody has their own stupid path that they take.
[65:14.49]And that guy's just sprint over here and crouch.
[65:17.98]Why did I do that?
[65:41.14]Okay, that was like a play.
[65:47.67]Okay, that was a play.
[65:49.69]Oh shit, I heard something in here.
[65:51.07]Oh, it was you.
[65:51.81]That was a fucking play.
[65:56.11]Me and that guy just went back and forth like he forgot his line.
[66:01.70]I can't even make the joke I want to make because everyone's so dumb sprinting up here.
[66:07.24]Me and that guy screwed up our stage reenactment for like a fight.
[66:11.34]And then he just let me do my move.
[66:21.79]I didn't... I wanted to shoot this guy.
[66:25.43]Not drop the... lobster pot full of magazines.
[66:37.35]Something else exploded.
[66:42.05]Gotta get out of here.
[66:43.63]Not that way.
[66:44.84]Is there an escape this way?
[66:45.74]Yes, there is.
[66:47.74]Vault out of here.
[66:48.36]Nice broken glass.
[66:51.14]Remember that one?
[66:55.08]Don't kill me.
[66:55.56]This is gonna kill me.
[66:57.46]Don't kill me.
[66:58.85]What am I thinking?
[66:59.45]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[67:06.94]I have aim assist on?
[67:07.84]Yeah, I do, for fun.
[67:09.22]I'm playing the game for fun.
[67:10.60]I don't have to use it.
[67:21.89]Everybody so badly wants me to turn it off.
[67:23.87]You want me to turn off aim assist?
[67:25.03]Everyone's like, oh my god, how dare somebody play this game with aim assist?
[67:30.49]How dare you?
[67:31.27]I'm not comfortable with this.
[67:39.54]Share game information.
[67:42.56]Really EA?
[67:44.80]Really EA?
[67:46.52]Sharing your game information will help make Sniper Elite 4 even better.
[67:49.58]Our developers can use data to inform gameplay changes, patches, new content, and more.
[67:54.00]It might even influence future games.
[67:56.22]All information sent from the game to Rebellion, a subsidiary of EA, is completely anonymous and isn't tied to your name, Steam profile, or anything else that could identify you.
[68:06.21]We will never share this data with anyone else.
[68:08.84]Wow.
[68:09.52]Interesting.
[68:10.62]Interesting.
[68:12.06]Well, how much data do you have that your checkpoint system is a piece of shit?
[68:16.22]Huh?
[68:16.72]How's that sound?
[68:19.12]Where's the aim assist?
[68:20.18]Yeah.
[68:20.62]I'll turn it off.
[68:21.04]There you go, guys.
[68:24.00]There.
[68:25.48]You want me to turn off aim assist?
[68:26.54]You got it.
[68:33.41]I'm gonna prove to you guys why.
[68:34.63]Like, you know, I just want to do a little casual, fun playthrough on the stream.
[68:38.68]Just hang out and, like, make a couple jokes.
[68:41.12]Fine.
[68:42.36]You want me to turn it on?
[68:42.98]You want me to turn on, like, 2012... ...Jerma?
[68:46.23]That, like, is good at video games?
[68:47.71]Sure, we can do that.
[68:56.24]Why don't we?
[69:07.67]Why don't we do that?
[69:15.78]Why don't we do that, boys?
[69:16.62]That guy up there fucking screwed it up.
[69:35.89]That guy up there behind me screwed it all up.
[69:38.01]That would've been fine.
[69:38.51]That would've been good.
[69:48.65]Sorry, that guy's an idiot.
[70:11.94]Show yourself, buddy.
[70:19.99]Hey, he's back.
[70:32.84]Ladies and gentlemen.
[70:36.52]He's back.
[70:52.33]He's back.
[71:03.32]He's back.
[71:05.14]He was never gone to begin with.
[71:10.09]Although he is getting surrounded though.
[71:24.55]Going up here.
[71:25.09]Take care of this guy up here.
[71:26.08]Watch this one.
[71:27.06]One shot.
[71:27.88]One fucking shot.
[71:29.76]See?
[71:30.04]Now I got his attention.
[71:31.78]Through the hoop.
[71:35.82]I killed that guy so good he exploded.
[71:38.56]I beat that guy so badly he fucking blew up.
[71:45.05]We're not even done.
[71:46.93]Aim assist.
[71:47.77]Guy needs to play on easy with aim assist.
[71:50.05]Yeah, I'm sure he does.
[72:03.19]I mean, like, he... Oh, you think he does, doesn't he?
[72:11.34]Guy needs to play on fucking aim assist, huh?
[72:18.66]He's made absolutely no progress.
[72:40.70]Okay, I saw the guy like fucking five times.
[72:47.49]I killed, look at that guy like jumping rope.
[72:49.81]I got him in the neck so bad.
[72:52.57]No!
[73:08.45]Let me let me just ask you something right well.
[73:10.65]I want to go over this because this this is fucking stupid You can't like jump in this game.
[73:16.81]There's no there's no jump in this game, right?
[73:20.49]There's a hang It's the same fucking action For me to hang from a ledge and jump from a ledge.
[73:27.97]It's space Why they cut what I wanted to hang from this fucking ledge I
[73:37.73]Like, come on, man.
[73:39.81]What the fuck?
[73:42.05]Are you sure you didn't want to just leap?
[73:44.05]Why would this even be an option if it's guaranteed to kill you?
[73:46.21]You think I fucking need aim assist?
[73:57.28]I want to hang from the sledge.
[73:59.70]Oh my god.
[74:03.06]Like, this is... I can't fucking physically get out of here.
[74:05.82]Unless I take the stairs down.
[74:12.78]See, right when I was starting to get back into it, I just get something that angers me a little, and I can't do it.
[74:17.30]Turn off jump assist.
[74:23.81]Where is this guy?
[74:31.15]Well... It's that fucking tank.
[74:39.50]Great.
[74:42.57]At least these guys are dead.
[74:46.31]Guy up top left.
[74:59.48]I fucking got this stupid fucking tank.
[75:02.22]Get away from me.
[75:06.18]It's just a tank shooting at me.
[75:15.87]Yeah, good luck helping your friend now.
[75:17.01]What are you, like an EMT?
[75:20.63]No, and there's still a guy behind me.
[75:23.82]Fuck it.
[75:28.48]Yeah, nice tank meta.
[75:30.12]He's going up there with a machine gun.
[75:31.16]Fuck this.
[75:31.86]This is just getting on my nerves at this point.
[75:44.74]Drink the ester soup.
[75:46.78]That's actual.
[75:49.56]Let's go.
[75:55.16]Let's go.
[76:04.71]Oh, he broke his neck.
[76:05.61]Get him some aloe vera.
[76:07.43]Get him some aloe vera gel.
[76:10.91]Alright, only two more and that's it.
[76:15.53]I'm just going to sit here for a second while I look at the map.
[76:19.97]Right here, I need to get rid of this one and then that one, and that's it.
[76:22.81]This one's behind me.
[76:25.09]This one's that way.
[76:26.23]Alright.
[76:27.45]I'm just going to chill right here.
[76:31.62]Tank incoming, but that's okay.
[76:33.44]I'm going to spot right here.
[76:42.48]Wait until we get off high alert.
[76:45.99]When will we finish this mission?
[76:47.61]This mission's actually kind of long.
[76:49.15]You have to, like, go around and destroy a bunch of shit.
[76:52.77]There's, like, five different objectives I have to blow up.
[76:56.13]It's the time of 2019.
[76:56.67]Hey!
[76:56.83]Hey!
[76:56.95]Wait.
[76:57.29]Got it.
[76:57.69]Uh...
[77:15.24]Turns out I didn't have to walk up and destroy them.
[77:21.31]Oh.
[77:23.17]Okay.
[77:25.09]Oh.
[77:26.97]Turns out I can just shoot them.
[77:32.30]Oops.
[77:40.82]Okay, now I'm okay with jumping here.
[77:43.54]Because I know I'm going to land on that.
[77:48.16]That almost fucking killed me.
[77:51.58]He jumped so far that I almost died.
[77:53.32]The one time I actually want to jump.
[78:00.92]Heaven forbid.
[78:06.01]He jumped over the whole thing.
[78:09.01]Shit, I gotta get out of here.
[78:17.25]Was that the joke?
[78:17.99]No, that was... I was trying to jump on this ledge and he jumped the whole thing.
[78:20.95]Like a fucking dummy.
[78:31.96]Okay, that tank's coming this way.
[78:33.44]Uh, I just need to get to the searchlight, but... Get over to the tank.
[78:41.71]One guy with a question mark on his head.
[78:47.19]Here they all come.
[78:48.79]Yep.
[78:49.43]Everybody now wants to know what's going on down here.
[78:52.35]Nobody wants to, like, go eat breakfast.
[78:58.19]Like... Don't you guys have other things to do besides walk around like this?
[79:13.36]Don't you have anything else to do?
[79:18.48]Shoot the tank in the head.
[79:19.35]I actually tried that.
[79:20.65]You, like, shoot the lights.
[79:23.93]Well, I'm... I can't really do anything right now.
[79:27.09]There's nothing I can do.
[79:30.97]There.
[79:31.49]That's my... That's what I can do.
[79:40.36]They all come over.
[79:41.38]Yeah.
[79:45.63]Oh, yeah.
[79:46.99]It was a rocket, guys.
[79:48.37]You figured it out.
[79:51.19]Oh, God.
[79:53.07]I just need to go that way.
[79:54.30]I think I can go that way now.
[79:57.30]So, just so we're clear of what's happening right now, right?
[80:00.64]This tank?
[80:01.56]This...
[80:10.14]Why did you do that?
[80:11.72]Why did you do that?
[80:13.62]Why did you?
[80:16.34]That was not something you should have done.
[80:18.24]That was no reason to do that.
[80:22.19]Okay.
[80:23.73]Well, thanks for killing those three guys.
[80:25.95]Thanks for getting rid of those three guys.
[80:27.67]That was going to be kind of a pain in the ass to get rid of.
[80:30.23]That was going to be...
[80:42.25]What the fuck?
[80:44.74]Out of all the things that possibly could have just happened.
[80:54.28]This game is fucking phenomenal.
[80:56.66]Turn off the tank assist.
[80:57.70]Jesus.
[81:14.55]Oh, boy.
[81:15.11]Oh, boy.
[81:17.39]There's your $100 joke.
[81:18.05]There's your $100 joke.
[81:22.75]And it wasn't even me that made it.
[81:25.16]I just threw a rock.
[81:26.06]That's all I did.
[81:27.66]The comedy just unfolded.
[81:28.92]All I did was throw a small rock.
[81:35.86]Do I have any health kits or anything?
[81:37.74]No.
[81:40.19]Jesus.
[81:45.76]You know what's funny about that?
[81:52.94]You know what's funny about that?
[81:55.54]If that didn't happen, I would not have been able to progress through the game.
[81:59.85]It's a good thing that happened.
[82:11.95]Optional objective.
[82:12.95]Whatever.
[82:13.35]I...
[82:15.35]There's, like, guns in here and shit.
[82:16.55]Hold on.
[82:16.89]Get out of my way.
[82:20.71]Let's take this thing.
[82:21.47]I don't have any more healing, though.
[82:25.48]How much better is this thing, you think?
[82:30.50]I just have to chill in here.
[82:31.50]I can't do anything stupid.
[82:33.20]Just save it here.
[82:33.84]I literally did need it.
[82:37.84]I needed tank assist.
[82:39.12]That's how fucking crazy that was.
[82:45.02]What did I just do?
[82:48.56]Oh, shit.
[82:49.02]No, cancel that.
[82:49.58]Do I have any grenades?
[82:52.52]No.
[82:52.86]I have, like, a mine.
[82:53.70]Can I, like, fucking fan that out here?
[82:59.72]No.
[83:00.66]That's bad news.
[83:02.22]Trip mine, S mine.
[83:05.41]Double press.
[83:06.05]I don't even know what the fuck that means.
[83:08.49]I just have to play well and shoot people.
[83:17.21]This is my only shot.
[83:18.01]Oh, my God.
[83:28.18]Come on.
[83:28.84]Why do you always... Why does everybody stand still in this game?
[83:33.08]Somebody move.
[83:35.20]Somebody just move from their spot.
[83:38.53]They have this room on complete lockdown.
[83:46.26]These people are so dumb, but they just don't move, so it's hard to do anything.
[83:51.28]Yeah.
[83:58.12]Come on.
[84:00.22]Come on.
[84:02.08]Oh, my God.
[84:03.89]Look at fucking the three stooges over here.
[84:07.17]Oh, nice job, Curly, Larry, and fucking Moe, the one behind me.
[84:12.77]What the f- Mmm!
[84:17.01]You know, I'm kind of just done.
[84:18.21]I'm kind of done with this.
[84:20.41]Like, I'm kind of done doing this.
[84:21.85]Like, I've just get, like... Get me the fuck out of this room.
[84:30.59]Getting killed by the fucking three stooges.
[84:32.52]Because I can't leave this room.
[84:35.52]There's no way for me to go.
[84:36.40]I legit have to just sit in the corner.
[84:43.34]There's nothing else I can do.
[84:44.10]I have to do this.
[84:46.82]This is gonna be fun.
[84:47.76]Oh, look at how fun this is.
[84:53.34]It's gonna wait for them to randomly decide that they're gonna come down the hall.
[84:58.39]Okay.
[84:58.63]I feel like I'm playing Rainbow Six Siege right now.
[85:06.68]You know, the game where, like, nobody moves.
[85:09.28]That dude just came in the window.
[85:20.51]Come in the window.
[85:21.91]Be an idiot just like your friend.
[85:32.10]I think I'm going to have to load a different save.
[85:33.54]I'm not sure I'm getting out of this, guys.
[85:35.56]This is continuously feeding through.
[85:37.62]Unless, like, somebody has a health kit.
[85:44.57]Nobody has any health or anything.
[85:46.89]So I'm just destined to have, like, an endless supply of people just keep running down this hall.
[85:52.24]My best bet is this one.
[85:55.30]Alright, we're going for the best bet here.
[85:56.85]Ready?
[85:57.03]That wasn't a good bet either.
[86:03.29]There's no way for me to go.
[86:09.55]I'm trapped.
[86:11.91]I'm fucking trapped up here.
[86:23.99]Get the fuck... What the fuck was that little hop?
[86:27.49]What am I doing?
[86:28.23]What the fuck are you doing?
[86:39.60]Okay.
[86:40.76]I just scooped him up.
[86:44.24]Ah.
[86:44.52]Ah.
[86:53.85]Back out, ahhh.
[86:55.21]Oh my god.
[87:04.54]Right through the eye.
[87:15.38]Okay, so here comes him, his friend.
[87:22.18]Okay.
[87:23.18]That gets rid of those two.
[87:25.60]But they just keep feeding down here.
[87:28.72]This is just the booze from Super Mario.
[87:30.51]It really is.
[87:34.45]Look, this guy's not even moving.
[87:35.51]I'm going to turn around.
[87:38.95]Look it.
[87:39.41]I told you.
[87:40.15]I fucking told you.
[87:41.96]I was trying to say this the whole time.
[87:44.22]Nobody believed me.
[87:53.22]Oh my god.
[87:53.74]Oh, sorry, my back was turned, boo.
[88:03.58]I can't, like, go outside either because this fucking tank is right here.
[88:06.38]I'm gonna save it right here.
[88:10.54]Yeah, there's one dude there.
[88:23.95]Bandage?
[88:24.33]I used it already.
[88:26.55]I already used the bandage.
[88:28.29]What are you guys on about?
[88:29.23]Come on, peek your head out.
[88:37.97]Now they're all here.
[88:40.73]Oh my god.
[88:42.35]This is just like... Alright, if you're all going to do that, then guess which way I'm going to go.
[88:49.76]Hopefully this way.
[88:53.51]Wait, what?
[88:55.01]Good, not every single person's here.
[88:57.09]Ooh, lucky.
[88:57.73]Lucky, they were all running around me.
[88:59.15]They all did the boo.
[89:00.15]They all did the boo.
[89:03.89]Did I just whistle at this guy?
[89:08.73]Okay, what else am I doing?
[89:09.54]Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab.
[89:10.74]Grab.
[89:12.12]Grab it.
[89:13.24]It's just a game of chase.
[89:15.18]This is called Chase the Guy.
[89:20.19]I win.
[89:22.11]Get to the radio.
[89:23.21]That was the radio.
[89:23.73]I was just there.
[89:24.87]Oh, no.
[89:26.29]Oh, no.
[89:27.97]Oh, no.
[89:30.81]That is... That's the radio I need to use.
[89:32.71]God damn it.
[89:40.56]Fuck.
[89:41.96]And now it's... I'm so dead.
[89:47.02]There's like... There's nothing.
[89:48.01]I can't do anything about this.
[89:51.38]I can't, what am I supposed to do about this?
[89:52.56]There's one guy up there.
[90:00.79]They're all just sprinting over here.
[90:02.47]What a flying fuck dude.
[90:17.52]Through his mouth.
[90:21.09]Fold.
[90:22.65]I'm going to have to fold here in a second.
[90:26.69]Of course, they're just going to keep feeding down here until forever.
[90:29.80]Wait, this might be an opportunity, maybe.
[90:33.50]Right.
[90:36.18]One more.
[90:37.08]Come on.
[90:37.54]Then just give me the radio room.
[90:44.28]No!
[90:45.72]Thank God you're the dumbest person in the game.
[90:48.10]Thank God you are so stupid.
[90:56.12]Thank God you guys have the size of your pee brains.
[91:02.86]Interact.
[91:03.20]Stop reloading.
[91:03.70]Interact.
[91:04.52]Alright, nice.
[91:05.20]Good thing we got a cut to leaving the mission.
[91:25.10]Hog champ, hog champ, hog champ.
[91:27.22]Truman is successful.
[91:37.83]Hey, look at that.
[91:39.89]Mission results.
[91:40.74]How much money did I make?
[91:41.46]Enough to buy another weapon?
[91:45.58]I'm going to switch to authentic mode.
[91:52.58]I can do authentic mode.
[91:54.48]Okay, I'm gonna give authentic mode one try.
[91:58.68]No, uh, custom.
[92:02.22]Wait, what?
[92:05.02]Okay.
[92:06.16]Custom difficulty.
[92:07.51]Hardcore.
[92:08.13]Authentic.
[92:14.97]Uh, I have eight dollars.
[92:17.69]Eight dollars.
[92:24.33]What about the Carcano?
[92:26.99]Really slow rate of fire, but no, don't fuck that.
[92:29.15]I guess it doesn't really matter.
[92:35.09]Should I get a new weapon?
[92:36.41]Like a new secondary?
[92:37.17]What do you guys think?
[92:39.95]I don't think I'm going to hold onto him for now.
[92:49.55]Unless I want to add like a health pack or something.
[92:53.21]Two bucks.
[92:53.91]I can't purchase these.
[92:55.77]I guess we'll be kind of... Yeah, that's better.
[93:02.80]More healing.
[93:03.92]I, like, need it.
[93:04.42]I'm willing to spend the money to do it because I'm always so short.
[93:12.72]Skins, upgrades, damage.
[93:14.57]I don't have that yet.
[93:16.89]Not for this one.
[93:18.21]Skill tree.
[93:18.77]Acquire extra items and ammo.
[93:22.49]Yeah.
[93:23.99]Fuck the other one.
[93:27.91]Whatever.
[93:28.49]We're doing authentic.
[93:29.31]We'll do edit custom.
[93:31.33]Aggression.
[93:39.14]Authentic suppressors.
[93:40.24]Yes.
[93:42.56]Marksman.
[93:43.34]Authentic.
[93:44.22]Auto heal.
[93:45.42]No.
[93:46.30]HUD.
[93:47.84]Player toughness.
[93:49.41]Weapons.
[93:51.69]Friendly fire.
[93:52.43]Yes.
[93:54.57]Gravity, uh, no.
[93:56.91]Uh, yes.
[93:57.73]Wind, yes.
[93:58.99]Scope, drift.
[94:01.13]And, uh, yes.
[94:01.79]Throw away shit.
[94:02.82]Throw away shit.
[94:03.48]Okay.
[94:03.62]Let's go.
[94:04.90]Just gonna try it.
[94:15.56]Authentic mode.
[94:26.27]Shut up.
[94:26.65]Okay.
[94:27.03]We're going to have to go around and talk to people again.
[94:40.74]Because for some reason in Sniper Elite 4, they thought this was a cool idea.
[94:45.94]For you to walk around and talk to four people for missions.
[94:50.18]Cool.
[94:50.42]This is the guy with the weird voice, isn't it?
[94:59.11]Those anti-tank guns will decimate the allies if we come this way.
[95:06.12]Whatever.
[95:10.02]Didn't need to jump that far for that.
[95:11.62]Alright, let's go.
[95:14.39]Authentic mode.
[95:15.37]Good old Authentic.
[95:16.85]There's no map.
[95:29.80]Oh boy.
[95:32.11]There's no map.
[95:32.81]There's no HUD.
[95:33.39]There's no mini-map.
[95:40.01]There's no fucking map.
[95:42.60]I'm dead.
[95:42.94]Okay.
[95:46.84]Gotta deal with Kappa.
[96:04.26]Got him.
[96:05.78]Guys didn't think I could handle authentic mode.
[96:08.86]Did ya?
[96:10.42]Oh, didn't think I could handle authentic mode, they tell me.
[96:17.33]Well, turns out he can.
[96:22.49]Wait, what?
[96:28.21]Dermot can't handle authentic mode.
[96:29.97]Can't really aim that well, can he?
[96:33.95]Got that guy right in his large intestine.
[96:40.45]He's bleeding out.
[96:44.22]Don't even worry.
[96:44.68]Right in his spleen.
[96:49.30]Who else?
[96:54.32]Yeah, see that whinge?
[96:55.67]I see him compensating for the wind.
[96:56.91]See the top right?
[96:58.11]Boink.
[96:58.93]Watch this wind shot.
[97:01.47]Look at that compensation.
[97:02.63]Perfect compensation.
[97:08.58]I have no more bullets.
[97:10.38]Okay, no more bullets.
[97:11.82]Let's go!
[97:17.30]Yeah.
[97:17.76]We're gonna put this back on normal.
[97:27.27]Is this an authentic streamer?
[97:31.45]Uh, yeah.
[97:32.11]We're gonna restart this game on normal.
[97:37.01]Is this the way it's gonna be?
[97:39.51]I'm gonna go get another drink.
[97:42.67]I'm getting a drink.
[97:43.45]Thirsty.
[97:43.93]Beer bag.
[97:44.23]I want a refill.
[97:46.28]Watch the cutscene while I get a refill.
[97:49.44]...must be in full swing.
[97:51.58]The components I found couldn't have been for any other purpose.
[97:56.19]Sure, we wrecked the operation.
[97:58.89]But how many of these components have already been shipped to Alagra?
[98:02.75]How close are the Nazis to mass production of the new missile?
[98:07.09]One thing's for certain.
[98:08.71]The Mafia were the ones disrupting the operation of the dockyard.
[98:13.65]It's a connection OSS are keen to exploit.
[98:17.07]Especially given Mafia involvement in Operation Husky, in which the Allies took Sicily.
[98:24.46]Weaver wants me to meet Salvatore Dinelli, an infamous mob kingpin.
[98:30.20]He thinks I can convince him to work with the Allies and the Partisans.
[98:34.56]But everything comes at a price.
[99:46.45]Yo.
[99:46.61]I just wanted to get a refill, man.
[99:52.91]Alright, we'll do this all normal.
[99:54.25]Let's get the Tommy gun.
[99:58.33]Ah, cozy fire.
[99:59.20]Nice and cozy.
[100:00.46]Ah, cozy.
[100:02.66]Just start the fucking mission.
[100:03.58]I don't want to talk to any of these people.
[100:04.62]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[100:10.48]It's a fucking authentic experience.
[100:17.47]Alright.
[100:18.55]Kill Piero.
[100:21.49]Cap up.
[100:23.64]And kill all soldiers.
[100:24.72]Wait.
[100:24.94]Kill all.
[100:25.52]Kill everybody.
[100:27.86]Kill Piero, Capo.
[100:29.58]And kill everyone.
[100:33.48]That's my kind of mission, guys.
[100:34.78]Okay.
[100:34.94]We're going to go here first.
[100:38.80]Who cares about any of these side missions?
[100:40.12]We're not doing those.
[100:45.23]This...
[100:58.67]You think you know where I am?
[101:00.15]Gotta triangulate that.
[101:07.09]Triangulate that.
[101:09.49]Yeah, triangulate that, motherfucker.
[101:12.67]They triangulated me.
[101:20.76]Triangulate this.
[101:21.54]Can I jump this?
[101:33.69]All I have to do is kill Kappa.
[101:36.57]Kappa?
[101:36.85]What's his name?
[101:37.29]Kapo?
[101:38.23]Whatever his name is.
[101:40.37]Getting there.
[101:47.98]Okay, they're not looking this way.
[101:49.08]I think I can get around them just by simply sprinting.
[101:51.22]Yep.
[101:51.40]Okay.
[101:53.34]Can I ride the tractor?
[101:56.25]No.
[101:57.91]Where are we at?
[101:59.29]I need to be here.
[102:01.35]So if I hug this wall, I should be okay.
[102:03.87]And I gotta get rid of everybody over here.
[102:06.87]I guess.
[102:10.11]It's probably not the safest thing to do.
[102:13.41]No, it is not.
[102:14.09]But, you know.
[102:16.41]I missed.
[102:21.30]Fucking aim assist.
[102:22.12]You know, I've been so used to using aim assist this whole fucking time.
[102:26.06]And now there's like a boat shooting me.
[102:28.84]Great.
[102:29.24]I'm dead.
[102:36.16]Motherfucker's been so used to aim assist the entire time he's played the game that he can't even turn it off.
[102:48.93]We're not going that way.
[102:49.83]I'm gonna wrap around this side.
[102:56.97]Okay.
[102:58.11]Calm down.
[102:58.91]Everybody around here has to go.
[103:04.03]That's a very land-based boat.
[103:14.46]Gotta play this one smart.
[103:16.97]Let's get this one, you know?
[103:20.19]Don't throw it at his head.
[103:25.83]The one guy I wanted to distract with that, I did not distract.
[103:30.74]Okay.
[103:35.22]Far away now.
[103:36.92]Destroy the O2 now.
[103:37.94]Kill all soldiers over here.
[103:40.91]Oh, shit.
[103:41.57]Okay.
[103:42.08]I gotta... I need, like, a fucking suppressor.
[103:45.64]I need to buy, like, suppressing ammo.
[103:46.96]I never have it.
[103:52.40]You know what I'm saying?
[103:53.04]Like, I have to get rid of these guys, but, like, I have to... How the fuck am I gonna do that and not be seen?
[103:56.38]That's just not gonna happen.
[103:58.78]I mean, like... I'll get, like, these two guys.
[104:09.70]He's still fucking alive, really.
[104:10.82]Okay, what if I just... I didn't even know that... He's so dead.
[104:18.53]Wait, this guy... I just stabbed that guy in the fucking penis.
[104:34.90]Make sure you get the guy in the fucking penis before you die.
[104:44.53]It just puts me right here, really.
[104:45.91]What the fuck?
[104:48.29]I can't go that way.
[104:49.47]I have to go around.
[104:50.72]I love how these are called stealth kills, but very clearly, this guy's making a shitload of noise when I get him.
[105:14.61]We gotta play it like Hitman.
[105:17.29]When you play it like Hitman, you gotta get rid of bodies.
[105:22.45]Okay, let's go.
[105:24.93]Guy up there.
[105:27.14]No, of course.
[105:28.88]Of course not.
[105:38.12]Everybody knows where I am now.
[105:41.34]You gotta triangulate me.
[105:42.54]That's fine.
[105:54.19]Right in the chest.
[105:54.71]Alright, does anybody feel like half this game wants you to be stealthy, and the other half is just like, fuck it, there's enemies everywhere, and when you shoot, you're gonna have to fight them all.
[106:08.98]Am I crazy?
[106:11.36]Make sure you get that stealth kill.
[106:12.80]Oh, by the way, when you fire your gun, be ready to fight every single fucking enemy.
[106:17.52]Because they did fucking, they did trigonometry and found you.
[106:36.30]Got him right in his ass.
[106:43.28]That's why you gotta fire from a square.
[106:46.12]Just don't shoot the gun.
[106:48.48]Apparently not.
[106:49.69]There's like people over here.
[106:50.79]This random fucking idiot.
[106:53.13]I'm almost out of ammo.
[106:58.09]I just made that guy trip.
[106:59.25]That's all I did.
[107:03.26]I shot that guy in the chest and he's like just fell down.
[107:06.56]That's what happened to him.
[107:09.12]I just gotta get out of here.
[107:10.03]I'm fucking getting like in this building and do Ring Around the Rosie for a minute.
[107:25.48]I wish, you know, people made like the comparison to like Metal Gear and Hitman and shit, but... So, in those games, you're talking about like Hitman, like games that are like this.
[107:36.48]Because like, there's no opportunity to like go hide.
[107:40.25]There's no opportunity to go hide.
[107:41.55]Why have like a hide and watch out for the alert system when it's a fucking sniping game?
[107:49.81]Like, what the, like, where the fuck is even, like, why even have it in the game?
[107:58.19]Nobody ever searches for you.
[107:59.98]They just are always aware that you exist.
[108:03.48]There's no searching.
[108:04.38]It's just, we know he's there, and there's a hundred fucking red dots.
[108:09.10]When he shows himself, we're gonna just big boo the fuck out of him and destroy him.
[108:16.52]Like Hitman, you shoot a guy, you run away, people look for you, and then you can hide.
[108:20.20]No, everything's red.
[108:22.82]A guy fired his gun.
[108:24.78]That means we're all red and we're just gonna shoot forever!
[108:30.58]We're not gonna move!
[108:32.28]Why would we move?
[108:34.62]We're just gonna wait for him to stand up and we're gonna go Everybody just stands in the same spot in this game and waits for you to stand up and then unloads their whole clip
[109:01.95]There he is!
[109:02.95]I knew he's over there!
[109:05.33]Now I'll move!
[109:07.05]Oh, shit!
[109:10.28]My chin!
[109:13.34]Play on easy mode?
[109:15.56]Easy mode doesn't stop the fact that the stealth system in this game is fucking stupid.
[109:27.52]Seriously, leave it to fucking Bethesda to make a game like this.
[109:38.66]I was standing next to the tree!
[109:41.20]I wasn't actually going to come look for you.
[109:42.46]I was waiting for you to walk in my line of sight and fire.
[109:45.68]I wasn't actually going to move.
[109:46.58]I was comfortable next to the tree.
[109:48.64]What about you?
[109:51.02]I was sitting right here.
[109:51.82]Oh my god.
[109:57.34]And now I'm stuck here forever.
[109:59.16]I'm stuck here with cover blown, surrounded by red dots.
[110:03.47]You know what?
[110:04.39]These guys are sentry guns.
[110:10.09]I'm surrounded by sentry guns.
[110:14.60]There's no hiding.
[110:15.44]There's no sneaking.
[110:16.84]It's just activate all the red sentry guns.
[110:20.10]That's Sniper Elite 4.
[110:26.00]Alright, like in this situation What am I supposed to do here?
[110:31.24]Just run this way backwards completely and like hope that they actually move?
[110:44.69]See exactly, exactly Shaggy Shagman gets it For a game about sniping, it's pretty stupid making sniping the worst possible thing you can do
[110:55.85]This is a game where you- This is called Sniper Elite.
[110:59.15]Not... Tactical Espion- Oh, hold on.
[111:01.85]Sorry, I got in the line of sight of the sentry guns.
[111:03.43]Let me just- Hold on just one second.
[111:09.47]Where the fuck is this?
[111:10.31]Where's the sentry gun?
[111:12.79]I can't even see where the sentry gun is.
[111:15.91]Now they're all- Now they all decide to move.
[111:17.31]Goddamn.
[111:22.83]Go play COD?
[111:24.11]Wait, what?
[111:27.33]I love Metal Gear, I love Hitman, they're like some of my favorite games ever.
[111:32.67]This game's called Sniper Elite and you're not supposed to snipe.
[111:36.61]What?
[111:43.16]Game sucks, game sucks.
[111:44.70]The game doesn't even suck.
[111:47.42]This part of the game is fucking stupid.
[111:51.72]This is just fucking stupid.
[112:03.26]I'd rather eat God.
[112:09.11]I think I have to restart the whole game.
[112:11.69]Because my great game checkpoint is in the middle of everyone.
[112:19.91]There's nothing I can do about this.
[112:22.33]The only thing I can do is sprint the fuck out of here.
[112:25.69]And hope that I can go hide somewhere where there's no enemies.
[112:27.95]What the fuck is that guy doing?
[112:35.73]What does that mean?
[112:37.25]I've seen that twice now.
[112:43.01]So, like, for me to continue playing without restarting the whole mission... Somebody just made fun of me saying this was COD.
[112:53.24]Somebody just called an airstrike on me.
[112:55.44]How many kills did that guy get in a row?
[113:00.94]Dude, this is the shit I was talking about, right?
[113:05.35]How long do I have to sit here for?
[113:07.85]They're not even looking for me.
[113:10.03]They're still sitting in the same spots, just red.
[113:16.45]If you're gonna have a system like this, why have it take this long?
[113:21.54]No one's moved.
[113:23.68]Some guy called an airstrike and everyone's standing still.
[113:28.66]Wait, what?
[113:30.08]It would be probably faster to restart the entire mission.
[113:35.67]Oh, now they're looking for me.
[113:38.21]Interesting.
[113:38.89]Not one dot has moved.
[113:42.85]You guys see him from where you're sitting?
[113:44.43]No.
[113:45.45]What about you?
[113:46.27]Nah.
[113:48.56]We're looking for him.
[113:52.08]Oh, wait, a guy moved.
[113:52.94]That guy moved.
[113:55.06]I think that guy just went to the bathroom.
[114:00.50]He was right here.
[114:02.44]I swear.
[114:09.67]Wait, what?
[114:10.81]This isn't the kind of talk of someone who beat Dark Souls 3.
[114:17.49]They have a person in every tree.
[114:19.06]They have a guy just next to every tree.
[114:21.70]I'm going this way.
[114:30.56]There's a boat.
[114:32.04]Can I please... This is like developer console.
[114:35.34]Don't even tell me there's a developer console.
[114:36.84]Don't tell me to do that.
[114:39.41]Okay.
[114:40.51]Well, now I know what I'm doing.
[114:42.15]Okay, don't be spotted by this.
[114:45.45]How am I going to get around this guy?
[114:54.76]Can I, like, get around him?
[115:06.09]Why can't I?
[115:06.57]I can't go anywhere.
[115:07.89]What the fuck?
[115:12.72]I can't go.
[115:13.42]This is shit.
[115:14.38]I can't go anywhere.
[115:16.94]I thought maybe I could sneak around.
[115:18.94]Nope.
[115:19.44]The boos have found me.
[115:29.37]Guess I'm gonna go this way.
[115:37.47]Look for a fuel tank on the boat.
[115:42.51]What's that sound?
[115:51.48]If there's ever a time to, like, not want to draw attention, you can shoot their grenades and they just fucking... Sometimes the people just explode.
[116:01.70]Sometimes the people just explode.
[116:03.47]I wonder what that sound was.
[116:07.68]You shot, he exploded.
[116:08.84]I need to heal so bad.
[116:23.86]Silent grenade.
[116:24.68]I need to go that way.
[116:37.09]I can't really throw a rock here.
[116:40.01]Oh, God.
[116:55.46]No, here we go.
[116:57.26]Here we go.
[116:58.64]Somebody's seeing me from behind, somebody's seeing me from... You know what, boys?
[117:01.79]I've had just about enough of you.
[117:09.77]Everybody shoot.
[117:11.49]Back where we started.
[117:12.37]Back where we started last time.
[117:18.38]Back where we fucking started.
[117:20.24]This is where it happened before.
[117:22.52]The whole fucking map turned red.
[117:31.31]Oh my god.
[117:39.19]I just... I... I don't know where to go.
[117:41.50]I'm gonna get seen.
[117:44.84]Just slide.
[117:52.12]Oh, I spotted something.
[117:53.12]Of course you did.
[117:53.72]They're all gonna run ahead like in a train.
[118:05.21]I will just train you guys through this whole house.
[118:11.91]I can't snipe these guys.
[118:17.15]Like if I could shoot these guys and like move to the right and move forward.
[118:19.78]No, if I shoot this gun, the whole map turns red.
[118:23.06]I mean, I get like the noise cue.
[118:26.84]Did I get the noise cue?
[118:27.80]I didn't even kill that guy either.
[118:32.48]No, it doesn't matter.
[118:33.28]He's not dead.
[118:33.72]And here comes a swarm of fucking bees that are coming in this room right now.
[118:42.13]Somehow I have not been spotted.
[118:43.45]Don't ask me how.
[118:48.88]No ammo either.
[118:49.56]I don't have any bolts.
[118:58.78]Well, this is gonna be fun.
[119:02.03]Should we go for a fucking sprint?
[119:09.80]We might have to do a fucking sprint.
[119:11.18]Oh, good.
[119:11.84]Thank God.
[119:13.08]Thank God you people are so dumb.
[119:15.33]Come search over here.
[119:21.45]Wait till your friend gets over here, and then we're gonna go one, two.
[119:23.87]One, two.
[119:27.51]Why did that first shot not fucking kill him?
[119:31.10]Just fucking hide.
[119:32.94]Sit in here.
[119:35.85]Come on.
[119:37.49]You want me to be cheap about this?
[119:38.67]I will be as cheap as I can fucking possibly be.
[119:43.09]Come look in the grass.
[119:46.37]This is just like League.
[119:49.13]Never gonna expect a gank.
[119:52.05]Just like Tevo.
[119:53.99]What's his name?
[119:54.53]Tevo?
[119:55.76]I got...
[120:05.87]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[120:19.65]Yeah.
[120:21.01]And just like that, just like the character TiVo from League of Legends.
[120:24.93]The guy that drops the poison mushrooms.
[120:27.32]I was a poison mushroom.
[120:32.96]And also TiVo can record your favorite shows.
[120:38.06]Save up to 25 gigs of data on your TiVo.
[120:46.87]Yeah, we're in the vineyard.
[120:49.17]So everybody here has to die, right?
[120:53.05]I think.
[120:58.55]Can't, like, blow up a wall or something?
[120:59.75]No.
[121:07.39]There we go, right here.
[121:22.20]That didn't work.
[121:25.39]What is that, ammo?
[121:29.37]Kill all.
[121:36.63]Ah.
[121:37.75]Oh well.
[121:43.88]Cheater.
[121:44.52]Nobody died.
[121:45.18]Everybody's fine.
[121:49.04]Play your place at me.
[121:50.58]Stop spawning deathclaws.
[121:51.72]Can I climb this wall?
[122:00.08]No.
[122:05.64]Who was that?
[122:07.93]No, no, nothing.
[122:11.51]There's a guy right here.
[122:16.97]I'm gonna whistle for this guy.
[122:17.83]And I'm gonna pull him over.
[122:23.18]No, I'm over, like, this side.
[122:25.48]This side.
[122:26.40]You don't hear me on this side?
[122:31.42]The guy around the corner heard it, but not the guy right here.
[122:38.44]Is this guy a dog?
[122:42.29]Oh my god, you guys.
[122:43.63]Fucking seriously.
[122:44.53]Well, that's my cue to get the fuck in here.
[122:47.27]All these guys have to die.
[122:49.53]Fine.
[122:58.04]Feed down these fucking stairs, buddy.
[123:05.96]That guy's right behind me.
[123:06.66]I just don't want to get collapsed upon.
[123:13.70]Somebody's doing Morse Co- Oh, come on!
[123:20.73]Son of a bitch.
[123:24.83]I need, like, ammo.
[123:36.27]Throw a grenade, maybe somebody will hear it.
[123:37.63]I know, right?
[123:39.29]Why do they do that shit?
[123:40.21]That stupid backflip.
[124:18.68]I gotta just kill everybody in here or something.
[124:20.24]Whatever.
[124:20.66]I got him right in his pelvic bone.
[124:24.04]I got him right in his pretzel bone.
[124:32.53]Oh shit.
[124:33.81]There's a guy up top.
[124:38.39]Where is he?
[124:53.38]I didn't get him the head.
[124:54.10]Fuck you.
[124:58.86]Fuck you all.
[125:02.16]Are they just going to keep feeding in here?
[125:03.96]There's an explosion.
[125:16.77]Well.
[125:21.17]There's a guy in this house.
[125:22.03]It's just bad.
[125:22.73]I wish these people would just move.
[125:29.53]I would sit here all fucking day.
[125:37.20]Oh, shit.
[125:40.08]The ammo's almost out empty.
[125:51.80]This is fucking... Like... Fucking come on.
[125:58.36]Like, seriously.
[125:59.14]This is... I'm about to fucking... I'm about to return this to GameStop.
[126:06.33]I guess we're going this way.
[126:20.63]Now he decides to come and get me.
[126:32.18]You really don't understand.
[126:33.18]I understand this game completely.
[126:38.60]But when it tells me I have to kill all enemies... Like... And I... This just... It's just... It's just... It's just not... It's just not... It's not... It's not!
[126:51.73]It's not!
[127:08.53]Everybody's hiding.
[127:09.43]And I don't have any ammo.
[127:15.65]Everybody's sitting in the corner.
[127:16.71]I told you.
[127:17.05]It's just like I'm playing fucking Rainbow Six right now.
[127:21.55]Sometimes a guy sprints across the map.
[127:40.23]Where are these guys even going?
[127:42.20]Where the fuck are you people going?
[127:43.66]I don't even know.
[127:48.38]Why?
[127:54.33]King of snipe.
[127:55.23]Yeah, we're playing pistol elite right now.
[128:02.57]I'm so dead.
[128:08.19]Well, I guess I can, like, maybe go around the other way.
[128:12.88]Hope I don't get shot by the sentry guns that this game has for AI for people.
[128:22.88]This series is terrible.
[128:26.54]I don't think so.
[128:27.36]But see, look, this is what I'm talking about.
[128:28.58]Like, why, like... They're just Boo from fucking Super Mario.
[128:37.68]Look, this guy's gonna come up the stairs.
[128:39.86]He was just standing completely still the whole time.
[128:42.64]He's gonna walk up these stairs.
[128:44.88]And I'm gonna kill him.
[128:47.69]I'm gonna kill them both.
[128:49.43]You know what?
[128:49.85]Fuck it.
[128:51.01]Eat shit.
[128:53.51]Oh no, a grenade!
[128:57.63]Ow.
[129:01.75]I'm still down here, though.
[129:07.44]What is he doing down there?
[129:10.78]There's a guy still there, right?
[129:20.66]Where is he?
[129:22.33]Fuck.
[129:30.29]Here comes another guy.
[129:32.31]Here comes another guy.
[129:33.07]He's gonna come up there.
[129:35.80]Here he comes.
[129:37.74]Should I go up this ladder or should I not?
[129:39.42]I'm not sure.
[129:40.62]Oh, there he is.
[129:41.28]I found him, boys.
[129:42.52]Ow.
[129:46.36]Give me your shit.
[129:52.02]I'm going to save.
[129:52.42]Yeah, I will.
[129:54.26]Need more bullets.
[130:02.49]Okay, well, here comes another guy around the other side.
[130:08.65]uh well at least I have that did anybody drop a bandage or anything well of course it didn't alright well I'm doing okay at the moment at this moment right now there's one more guy and what do you know ladies and gentlemen he's just going to come up the ladder because in sniper elite
[130:40.41]People are fucking dumb.
[130:45.99]There's even more people.
[130:47.71]More people just feeding up the ladder.
[130:52.35]I don't want to keep doing this.
[130:54.91]I don't want to keep doing this shit.
[130:57.87]I thought that guy was still alive.
[131:03.57]Oh, they're shooting at me.
[131:05.92]Here, take that.
[131:07.26]It's a present.
[131:09.98]You've got to be, like, fucking kidding me.
[131:12.62]You've got to be kidding me.
[131:16.75]I, like, don't... Why do they keep doing this?
[131:20.29]Just let me move on with my fucking life and, like, continue the mission.
[131:24.05]Why do you have to have just fucking brainless idiots just go stand over here and climb the ladder for no reason?
[131:29.04]And they're not gonna do anything.
[131:31.04]They only do something if you're a fucking... I'm fucking going.
[131:35.54]This is... I'm out.
[131:36.44]Bye.
[131:41.55]I have to kill these two?
[131:43.58]But people just keep spawning.
[131:49.94]Who else?
[131:50.54]Just people over here?
[131:51.36]Okay.
[132:01.72]Kill all soldiers in and around Castle Hill.
[132:12.06]Returning to GameStop.
[132:13.04]No, the game's fun.
[132:14.48]I like this game.
[132:16.24]It's just when you give me a mission to kill every enemy, you don't think I'm going to get spotted?
[132:24.03]This is going to fucking happen every time.
[132:25.63]I wish I had my audio.
[132:32.83]I wish I could hear anything.
[132:38.23]We've got to the point of the stream where it's a complaint stream.
[132:46.26]No ammo, shit.
[132:48.28]Shit.
[132:52.60]Did I do it?
[132:54.74]I think I did it.
[132:55.22]Can't find anything else.
[133:04.94]It's always a complete stream.
[133:08.29]That's not true.
[133:09.03]Sometimes we drive gorillas with cars.
[133:12.57]Sometimes we do a paint stream.
[133:13.89]Sometimes we presto bajesto.
[133:15.07]It's not always that.
[133:19.83]I just got fucking insta-killed.
[133:24.50]This mission's fucking stupid.
[133:26.90]I'm sorry.
[133:27.72]That would be a complaint stream if I want, but kill all enemies.
[133:30.62]Like, this is the stupidest fucking thing in a sniper game.
[133:34.26]Kill all enemies.
[133:40.54]There were like 15 fucking people over here, and there's still a guy left.
[133:46.22]There's still a guy hanging out up here.
[133:49.76]He's just sitting over here.
[133:50.79]I guess I'll come out now.
[133:53.75]Is it safe?
[133:55.65]Oh, it wasn't safe.
[133:58.83]That guy had diarrhea.
[134:00.39]You see that?
[134:03.05]That motherfucker had diarrhea.
[134:11.36]There's not one more.
[134:12.10]I have to kill this guy too.
[134:15.38]Come on.
[134:21.54]Go kill this guy.
[134:22.54]Oh, and these two guys, I think.
[134:24.04]I don't know.
[134:26.60]I'm not actually sure at this point.
[134:28.36]For real.
[134:34.54]I did it.
[134:35.94]I killed everybody in fucking cranberry juice, whatever the fuck it is.
[134:43.82]What is this other objective that I'm just here?
[134:45.60]I might as well look at it.
[134:48.33]Destroy the gun.
[134:49.17]I'm sitting right here.
[134:50.17]Why not?
[134:54.35]Okay, now I can go actually go complete the mission, right?
[134:56.69]I can really use a health pack, though.
[135:08.88]Killed everyone.
[135:10.48]Use my med kit?
[135:11.65]I don't have a med kit.
[135:15.25]I don't have one of those things.
[135:18.27]I will continue to search.
[135:22.71]Where does it go?
[135:24.31]Bandage.
[135:24.67]Thank God.

[135:36.23]Oh, that's gonna be... That's gonna be a fun time.
[135:39.45]I can already tell.
[135:41.26]I'm already complaining about it, and there's no reason to complain.
[135:43.66]How do I get there?
[135:45.32]This way?
[135:48.92]Go left?
[135:58.52]Don't hurt me.

[136:03.34]That wouldn't hurt me.
[136:06.56]Guys, if you were hanging from here and you dropped like that far, you'd be fine.
[136:13.94]Take a look at my health.
[136:15.22]I am half dead.
[136:17.68]Dropping from like fucking nine feet makes you half dead.
[136:23.50]You're like close to death from falling from like eight feet.
[136:33.13]One out of two dead Okay, random dude coming over here two random guys Just reload this shit

[137:50.81]The guy sneaking around is creeping me the fuck out.
[137:59.89]Telescope joke.

[138:27.05]Where's his body?
[138:29.66]No.
[138:29.80]Am I being seen by somebody?
[138:33.84]Is there a sniper up there?
[138:36.03]I hope not.
[138:39.84]Oh my god, I picked up an item.
[138:42.46]I picked up a fucking clip on the ground.
[138:45.72]Why do these guys have supersonic clip hearing?
[138:47.93]It's only when you pick up a weapon.
[138:50.73]Who's he talking to?
[138:53.03]I got nothing to raid.
[139:12.52]Okay, I got some band to use this right now.
[139:16.05]How am I on that ammo?
[139:25.31]Well, I'm running.
[139:25.85]I need to make these count.
[139:32.12]We might just go for a throw a grenade at Capo.
[139:35.12]That's a possibility, guys.
[139:37.56]It really depends.
[139:39.44]I'm fully willing to just throw a grenade at Capo.
[139:42.48]And just sprint to the exit.
[139:44.48]I'll play this like Hitman.
[139:45.42]I don't give a fuck.
[139:51.25]Any ins this way?
[139:52.27]I don't think so.
[139:58.81]I hear people practicing shooting.
[140:06.19]Um, anything on this table that I can use?
[140:09.11]I wish I had the hammer.
[140:10.09]I wish I could do melee kills.

[142:22.16]How do we kill this guy?
[142:23.46]There's gotta be, like, an elaborate way we can do this, right?
[142:27.67]Yeah.

[145:18.37]No.
[145:18.73]Apparently that's in cover blonde.
[145:21.63]Don't save this game.
[145:25.28]Go back here and silently get rid of this guy.
[145:27.42]I obviously can't do anything.
[145:29.52]So just get rid of him and I have to snipe Piero.
[145:31.96]That's exactly what I have to do.
[145:33.76]Stealth kill this idiot.
[145:35.73]Give him a DDT.
[145:36.41]Okay.
[145:38.89]Okay.
[145:44.77]Planted in his pathing?
[145:45.71]He has no pathing.
[145:48.57]His pathing is stand still.
[145:51.93]And then un-fucking-load if you see the person.
[145:57.25]Is this like a good spot?
[145:59.57]Where is Piero?
[146:00.77]Is that him?
[146:02.45]I would laugh if that was just him.
[146:09.64]Investigate Abbott.
[146:10.96]Investigate Abbott.
[146:12.54]Maybe he like comes out here or something.
[146:18.74]Why would they put a little roost here for no reason?
[146:23.71]Oh well.
[146:28.99]I'll keep going.
[146:30.43]Whatever.
[146:30.73]I have no idea where he'll be.
[146:40.34]Who knows?
[146:47.52]At least that sniper is gone.
[146:48.94]Well, what about over here?
[146:49.72]Can I, like... Is there a reason why I could do this?
[146:56.10]Maybe?
[147:01.76]No.
[147:03.14]Uh, well, I guess I'll just go this way.
[147:07.55]Can I, like, go in?
[147:08.93]This is where I just was.
[147:10.55]So I'll just go straight through, I guess?
[147:13.23]I don't know.
[147:22.32]kill capo he's probably gonna be taking like a bath somewhere who knows oh wait is that maybe that's him the blue circle running low on ammo I wish you would stop talking so the guy doesn't like well people can hear you speak man
[147:54.50]Okay.
[147:56.94]Got some ammo.
[147:58.52]I'm cool with that.
[148:01.34]Okay.
[148:08.51]I guess I just keep going around.
[148:12.05]Maybe I'll be able to climb up a window or something.
[148:15.15]Eventually.
[148:15.59]If I go all the way around the whole damn house.
[148:17.61]Sniper early.
[148:22.51]Sniper early.
[148:25.90]Sneak around a fucking house.
[148:28.78]With a silenced pistol.
[148:39.67]I have to assume he's going to be down here.
[148:41.07]Do you have anything important on you?
[148:51.58]Sorry I made that so uncomfortable for you.
[148:56.84]Got a bandage.
[148:57.44]Good, good, good, good.
[148:58.52]Let me just make sure.
[149:04.05]No, that's Investigate Abbott.
[149:05.15]He's just in there somewhere.
[149:11.03]I don't know.
[149:11.49]I guess just go to the marker.
[149:13.47]Hopefully there's a way I can sneak in over there.
[149:26.17]Are those doors open?
[149:38.16]No.
[149:39.70]Every time I shoot the gun.
[149:42.70]Yes, I'm aware that I'm low on ammo.
[149:45.18]Please keep reminding me every time I fire my weapon.
[149:56.02]Hello, friendos.
[149:57.14]Oh, hello there.
[149:59.54]Just take them both on.
[150:08.97]No.
[150:09.33]Oh, my god.
[150:10.69]I just wanted to get the attention of this guy and his friend, and the whole place heard it.
[150:16.73]Oh, god.
[150:25.63]Here we go.
[150:27.07]Oh, here we go.
[150:27.97]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[150:28.83]Easy.
[150:32.73]Use the box.
[150:33.29]Get behind the box.
[150:36.07]Turns out that was a good thing to do.
[150:38.31]Turns out that that was actually, like, not stupid.
[150:42.27]Stupid.
[150:46.37]Is that him?
[150:47.79]No, that's a guy I marked.
[150:51.57]Where the fuck is this guy?
[150:52.43]Where is he?
[150:52.81]Is that him?
[150:56.75]I don't think that was him.
[151:05.79]Is he just in, like, the church?
[151:12.04]He's definitely, like, just standing at the altar doing, like, his fucking sacrifice.
[151:22.18]Yep, he has to be in there doing a sacrifice.
[151:23.78]Something fucked up, you know what I mean?
[151:33.70]Just keep murdering people.
[151:34.70]Eventually, it'll be the right person.
[151:38.02]I know, right?
[151:39.34]Seriously.
[151:40.74]That didn't hit him in the head either.
[151:42.00]Fuck.
[151:42.96]Well, you know, sometimes, when you're in a position like this, you gotta go balls in.
[151:51.13]Pin your balls on the wall and go for it.
[151:56.11]Where is he?
[151:57.39]Where's Pierre?
[151:58.91]Where's Pierrot?
[152:04.64]Come on, Pierre.
[152:06.34]You're going to be one of these people.
[152:07.32]You have to be.
[152:10.22]I think it might be that.
[152:11.26]He's inside the building.
[152:13.34]That guy's throwing a grenade.
[152:23.32]Alright, Pierre.
[152:24.32]Where is he?
[152:26.07]Where is he?
[152:26.61]It's definitely this guy right here.
[152:28.75]He's definitely this guy in the jail cell.
[152:31.25]Is this him?
[152:33.47]Where is he?
[152:35.84]Come on.
[152:38.12]Where the fuck is this guy?
[152:41.94]Where is he?
[152:42.44]That's not him.
[152:45.34]I'm gonna laugh so hard if it's him.
[152:57.30]He's in this church.
[153:00.06]I would be so shocked if he wasn't.
[153:01.54]He's just the guy that's standing in the back there.
[153:05.34]But how the fuck do I get up there?
[153:06.44]Oop!
[153:07.02]Okay, here we go.
[153:09.08]Got you, Pierre.
[153:11.66]Thought you could get away from me?
[153:12.54]Nope, I'll search your... Your whole dining room for you.
[153:20.08]Where... Where the fuck is this guy?
[153:25.58]It has to be that person.
[153:30.72]But he's in such a strange spot.
[153:33.36]Good luck.
[153:36.07]Give me like a staircase up or a staircase down or anything.
[153:49.08]He's here.
[153:53.40]He's below me.
[153:58.22]Down, up.
[154:06.27]I'll search your whole house, man.
[154:09.18]The only thing I can think of is just to keep, I guess, going.

[156:17.49]This is going to give me fucking... I'm seriously going to have a stomach ache at the end of this.
[156:28.06]Now we get to play the fun game of Sniper Elite where everyone stands still and you have to... There's nowhere to go.

[163:22.97]Here they all come again.
[163:23.89]Oh my god.
[163:34.12]I'm gonna give this like one or two more tries and then I'm fucking never playing this fucking game again.
[163:37.80]The fuck am I supposed to even do here?
[163:44.45]Look at the top left.
[163:51.93]Like, up here?
[163:53.01]Or you mean like in a circle?
[164:03.62]I know that the objective marker is saying, hey, this is where you need to go, but... There are like 12 people sitting where I need to go.
[164:11.14]And they will not move.
[164:14.76]These, like, these fucking, like, 20 people in the middle here are just never going to move.
[164:19.46]And they're always going to kill me.
[164:23.59]And then shit like this is going to happen, and then I'm guaranteed to lose.
[164:28.77]Like, 109, 110, like, I wish I could follow that, but this whole courtyard is full of fucking people.
[164:53.37]I'm gonna have to just kill everybody.
[164:59.84]This is gonna be real fun.
[165:10.80]It's gonna feed into here.
[165:11.92]It says die.
[165:29.12]Okay.
[165:39.44]I'm almost out of ammo.
[165:53.43]Once every single person is dead in here, apparently, then I'm going to go for it.
[166:10.24]That guy has a sniper rifle.
[166:16.76]Okay.
[166:18.18]So.
[166:20.36]Submachine gun elite.
[166:25.20]Everybody's fucking dead.
[166:26.92]Except for this guy.
[166:27.84]And now he's dead.
[166:36.65]Okay.
[166:38.63]Let's go find Mr. Capo.
[166:46.89]129, 128, 127.
[166:47.49]No, now we got a different objective.
[167:01.68]It's tracking the other objective now.
[167:09.30]I swear to God if that's him.
[167:11.87]Please have that be him.
[167:13.61]Shit.
[167:14.73]You hungry?
[167:15.37]Hold on.
[167:56.49]She'll eat.
[167:57.71]We'll eat.
[167:58.03]It's going to be fine.
[167:58.75]It's early.
[167:59.37]It's fine.
[168:32.14]Okay.
[168:39.88]No, we were just discussing what we were doing.
[168:41.92]What food we were going to do.
[168:48.89]Cover blown.
[168:49.71]Oh no.
[168:50.55]Cover blown for the one guy that's still here.
[168:52.07]There's another guy over here.
[168:58.13]Who is this person?
[168:59.95]Look at these magical non-existent people.
[169:02.49]Like this guy.
[169:13.05]Kill Capo.
[169:13.87]Like, okay.
[169:15.09]Okay, I'd love to do that.
[169:17.61]Why is this... 125 meters now.
[169:27.52]Let's just get rid of this and see what happens.
[169:34.09]Investigate this thing, apparently.
[169:35.85]Like, in here?
[169:46.67]No, down?
[169:47.45]Down?
[169:52.93]I'm just gonna go down.
[169:54.29]I just don't even care.
[169:59.03]Please end this fucking madness that is this mission.
[170:15.98]If he's this little blip over here in the corner, I'm going to have a heart attack.
[170:20.06]Okay, I'm investigating.
[170:30.66]Did I investigate it?
[170:32.06]Apparently not.
[170:32.64]There's nobody even around.
[170:40.69]Who cares?
[170:41.13]Just blow it up.
[170:43.33]We gotta find the Abbott's documents.
[170:49.52]I just want to kill Capo.
[170:51.40]But he just doesn't exist.
[170:52.38]I don't want to track this anymore.
[170:59.25]Please.
[171:00.35]Please track this.
[171:02.47]I just want to kill Capo.
[171:06.75]The mystery person.
[171:17.57]I mean, this looks like a living space, right?
[171:22.94]This guy's gonna be sitting here reading a book or something.
[171:30.79]Somebody just Google this for me.
[171:35.71]Because this is getting real dumb.
[171:38.44]Real fucking quick.
[171:47.45]Like over here?
[171:52.53]Apparently I'm getting closer.
[171:55.10]I think.
[172:03.06]It's nearby objective is like, now I'm not going the right way, but I'm going to leave the marker.
[172:11.75]Look at the marker.
[172:17.06]You guys want to see me get real mad at this game?
[172:19.82]If it's those blips over there in the corner, not even inside this circle, you're going to see me get real mad.
[172:29.12]Because that's fucking real dumb, if that's the case.
[172:33.35]In fact, I think that is what it is.
[172:36.79]Yeah, that's definitely what it is.
[172:38.23]They're in that fucking house.
[172:39.85]They're in that house.
[172:41.55]That house is not in this marker.
[172:46.35]Why would you put this marker here?
[172:48.97]If it is that totally fucking meaningless.
[172:53.65]Yeah, that's what it is.
[172:54.85]Mm-hmm.
[172:58.83]Let's go there.
[173:00.66]Now the question is, how the fuck do I go there?
[173:09.66]Just get me out of this fucking maze.
[173:15.46]Okay.
[173:16.36]Oh, that's such bullshit.
[173:17.74]Don't even, yeah.
[173:20.38]Okay.
[173:27.90]Not even in the circle.
[173:32.90]Where is he?
[173:35.11]Where is, oh, there he is!
[173:36.71]Oh, there's Capo.
[173:39.07]He's downstairs.
[173:42.51]Downstairs in the dungeon.
[173:46.72]God there.
[173:47.18]He is.
[173:47.40]I think I heard something.
[173:49.86]Yeah, you did I'm so fucking done man.
[174:00.28]I'm so done with this.
[174:01.60]I'm fucking done.
[174:02.98]I'm done.
[174:03.58]I'm done Fuck this Fuck you capo I'm not doing this shit anymore
[174:17.10]Why don't you come over here?
[174:17.92]Why don't you come over here?
[174:21.32]I can't tell if that was angry or if that hurt him.
[174:47.90]Why would they be in here?
[174:48.96]Are they escaping?
[174:53.00]They're not escaping, are they?
[174:55.74]They're like the fucking wine cellar.
[174:59.26]They're escaping.
[175:01.60]There he is.
[175:02.70]He's dead.
[175:03.06]I win.
[175:10.53]Game actually sucks.
[175:17.21]Got him.
[175:23.48]Alright, I win.
[175:30.25]Exfoliate the area.
[175:31.85]What?
[175:33.51]Alright, get me out.
[175:36.21]Run.
[175:39.41]I don't know.
[175:39.81]Just get me out of this fucking game.
[175:41.37]I'm done.
[175:42.89]We're reloading.
[175:43.95]We're just going to run.
[175:44.62]We're just going right to the exit.
[175:45.92]The exit is right up here.
[175:46.84]We're just going to take a left and sprint.
[175:50.10]Just get out of here and get the fuck out.
[175:54.04]Run for our fucking lives.
[175:57.56]This way, right?
[176:04.66]Down here.
[176:06.73]Why would you block that off?
[176:08.05]God damn it.
[176:10.20]I don't even care about the stupid side mission.
[176:11.80]Just get me.
[176:12.90]I win.
[176:13.82]I beat the mission.
[176:14.42]That's all I care about.
[176:16.32]I'll get me done.
[176:17.12]We win.
[176:20.64]I just gotta go out.
[176:27.74]Ugh.
[176:30.82]Enemy's searching.
[176:31.58]I don't care.
[176:35.14]Sorry, guys.
[176:35.54]There was sentry guns here.
[176:40.66]We're having a picnic.
[176:41.66]What the fuck are they doing out here?
[176:46.84]Oh my god.
[176:55.16]I wanted to throw the TNT.
[177:06.76]How does it explode?
[177:08.86]Is that a gun?
[177:12.50]Will that blow up?
[177:13.70]If somebody touches it or what?
[177:16.73]Come and get me.
[177:23.99]And... Come on.
[177:31.40]What?
[177:35.66]All that guy's skin just came off.
[177:37.32]Where did he come from?
[177:42.59]This guy just appeared here to die.
[177:44.21]This dude wasn't here.
[177:45.77]That guy wasn't here.
[177:52.84]Get me out.
[177:53.32]Get me out.
[177:53.72]Get me out.
[177:54.22]Exfoliate.
[177:55.12]Exfoliate.
[177:59.36]Almost.
[178:01.14]Go.
[178:02.28]Get out.
[178:07.17]Intentional.
[178:07.95]Yeah.
[178:09.43]Somewhat.
[178:14.52]Oh, come on.
[178:18.78]A tank.
[178:20.00]A fucking tank.
[178:21.40]Where's the exit?
[178:22.74]Right up here on the right.
[178:27.24]You gotta make it so not easy for me to do it, don't you?
[178:32.10]Whatever, just go.
[178:34.78]Go.
[178:37.12]I'm surprised that didn't kill me.
[178:42.23]Alright, we're out.
[178:44.11]Win.
[178:44.71]Game over.
[178:50.23]I gotta say a couple of prayers first.
[178:55.89]That was not good.
[178:58.53]That mission?
[179:00.25]That mission sucked ass.
[179:01.27]That was the worst mission so far.
[179:09.84]That mission was kill every single enemy in a large area and run around aimlessly in a spot where the enemy was not even.
[179:18.99]Kill every fucking enemy and then, by the way, search your ass off to your heart's content this giant circle where this guy is supposed to be.
[179:26.77]Just kidding, he's in a bunker way up to the top where, like, he's not even in the circle.
[179:34.67]That mission was dog shit.
[179:36.68]Just beat the game.
[179:43.43]I thought for a second I was like, did it win?
[179:45.09]Alright.
[179:47.45]Alright.
[179:48.65]That's gonna be it for tonight.
[179:53.99]This game, I do like this game though.
[179:55.17]I'm having fun.
[179:59.04]This is my kind of mission.
[180:03.34]So, that's gonna be it for this weekend.
[180:06.52]I'm going to... I won't be around tomorrow, but...
[180:10.64]I might still... I might just play this game.
[180:13.54]Again, like on Sunday or Monday.
[180:15.12]Not sure.
[180:18.78]Because I feel like I'm this far into it.
[180:20.34]How many more missions can there possibly be?
[180:21.86]Like four or five?
[180:24.42]Are there like more than ten missions in this game?
[180:27.74]Like eight?
[180:28.24]Something like that?
[180:38.43]Only two hours?
[180:38.89]I've been streaming for three hours.
[180:44.34]We've been live for three hours.
[180:50.14]This game's definitely fucking hilarious.
[180:55.94]We'll see.
[180:56.44]I'm not sure.
[180:56.76]I know there's a couple other things I'd like to do.
[180:59.02]I might like to get back into For Honor.
[181:01.50]And try that another time.
[181:02.83]Try to get better at it.
[181:05.83]Or, I mean, I do want to play the movies.
[181:07.41]Because there was...
[181:12.70]There is a couple of things I want to do in the movies that could be really funny.
[181:21.50]Three-hour stream felt like an eternity.
[181:26.25]We'll see, though.
[181:27.99]Before I go, I do want to make sure that I say... I didn't want to miss anything for bits and shit.
[181:38.39]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[181:39.13]Hey, Jaybird, thanks for the $5.00.
[181:42.43]A little while ago.
[181:44.25]Gummy Monk gave $5 too.
[181:45.51]Don't be mad.
[181:46.03]We still love you.
[181:50.12]Thanks a lot, guys.
[181:50.76]And I'm still trying to find a solution for these sub-notifications.
[181:55.20]That's something that I'm working on.
[181:56.94]I'm trying to figure out what I want to do.
[182:01.54]Once I figure it out, I'll let you know.
[182:04.06]But I'm actively thinking of what to do.
[182:08.00]Anyways, have a good rest of your night, guys.
[182:09.63]I will see you.
[182:10.39]If I don't see you this weekend, then of course I'll see you on Tuesday.
[182:15.47]I don't think I want to do another scheduled Sniper Elite stream.
[182:20.45]But it might be worth it just to try to do another couple missions.
[182:23.81]Maybe off schedule or something like that.
[182:25.29]We'll see.
[182:27.59]Have a good night.
[182:28.57]I'll talk to you guys if I see you.
[182:30.39]I'll see you.
[182:30.79]If not, then I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[182:32.87]Take care, everybody.
[182:33.79]See you all soon.
[182:35.76]Good night.
[182:50.77]you
[183:25.71]you
