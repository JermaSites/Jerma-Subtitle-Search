[00:01.11]Too many people needed them.
[00:02.77]So Pyro, what you're saying is you want to just run in there with the flamethrower like instantly?
[00:07.03]Is that what you meant?
[00:08.03]Sure.
[00:08.93]Absolutely.
[00:12.81]Oh, that's a Flog Pyro.
[00:13.77]Oh my god.
[00:17.79]This Pyro... I can't hit you that fast.
[00:23.76]He's gonna... He's gonna... Are you serious?
[00:31.23]One more hit would have done it.
[00:32.91]One crap.
[00:33.45]He was just so overhealed.
[00:34.71]He had like 400 something health.
[00:44.61]Hello.
[00:45.03]This is a very long wait.
[00:51.40]I'm not waiting.
[00:54.08]You have a Quick-Fix.
[00:54.78]I should have rocket jumped forward with you.
[00:56.68]Would have taken us both.
[00:59.98]It wouldn't have really done a whole lot.
[01:04.32]It would have saved me like half a second, a second or so.
[01:08.73]So much death.
[01:10.63]He's behind you!
[01:14.71]He jumped into me!
[01:16.23]I will not be held responsible.
[01:17.21]Alright, I'm going to play Demoman.
[01:25.44]I guess what I do like about the black box is that it's not, like, terrible to shoot people from long range, because no matter how much damage you do, you always get 15 health back if you hit someone.
[01:33.48]Yep.
[01:33.98]That's a good thing about it, I guess.
[01:35.32]I don't know.
[01:35.94]It's growing on me.
[01:36.96]It's growing on me.
[01:38.12]And I like the sound it makes.
[01:39.28]It's fantastic.
[01:43.06]Here we go.
[01:47.27]What the... Ah!
[01:48.89]I'm out of ammo!
[01:49.55]Shit!
[01:49.81]I just blown the Conqueror!
[01:51.63]I, like, blew the Conqueror!
[01:52.75]I'm trying to switch back to my rocket launcher and I'm stuck on a Zatoichi!
[01:55.92]Oh, this is shitty.
[01:56.84]I need a dispenser.
[01:57.62]Oh, you sure you don't want me to build my sentry, like, inside your sentry?
[02:06.87]Oh my god, that was so dumb.
[02:08.59]I didn't even mean to do that.
[02:11.65]One direct hit or lock and load is gonna destroy the whole show.
[02:15.49]Oh, I'm dead.
[02:18.50]Is it still there?
[02:19.44]Dude, if you had both the sentries wrangled there, how, like, insanely hard to kill would that be?
[02:25.25]It would be impossible without a... Spy?
[02:28.80]At least... I mean, you'd have to be a pretty good spy.
[02:33.04]Because if there's two people doing that, they're obviously communicating.
[02:38.04]You know, Black Box is cool.
[02:39.84]I'm using it with the Conqueror as well.
[02:40.82]Conqueror seems kind of nice.
[02:41.99]Yeah, that's actually a really good combo.
[02:44.17]Actually, I just realized I'm a complete lifesteal soldier.
[02:47.61]Black Box, Conjurer, has a Toichi.
[02:50.71]Yeah, that's like the super heal.
[02:53.60]You get an overheal.
[02:54.72]Well, not overheal.
[02:56.16]You get a, uh... Like, you are, like, your own, like, overhealing medic.
[03:01.00]Alright, goodbye.
[03:09.55]Oh, crap.
[03:11.25]Hey, I'm still alive.
[03:11.87]What do you know?
[03:13.75]Yeah.
[03:15.38]I always love the first... The first, like, five seconds of every Team Fortress game is always just... It's just... It's always the exact same.
[03:24.00]I love it so much.
[03:24.74]It's just complete and total carnage.
[03:26.98]I'm, like, stuck with my sword.
[03:28.95]I have to go back to the cabinet to reset it.
[03:32.45]It will never change, unless it's, like, a CP map, but a payload map with, like, cards.
[03:37.35]Oh, yeah, it's just utterly dumb.
[03:40.36]The stickies at the door, the Ubers at the ready, the sniper's dots etched onto the garage door.
[03:45.82]The garage door or the chain door?
[03:47.78]I don't know.
[03:48.24]Chain link fence.
[03:49.34]Uh, yeah, just, yeah, whatever.
[03:51.12]Garage door.
[03:55.37]Come here, friend.
[03:55.87]There can only be one.
[03:57.21]Thank you.
[04:01.51]I love getting a House of Toichi kill.
[04:05.00]It is very, very satisfying.
[04:07.94]Let's push.
[04:10.39]Ah, that's a spy in front of me.
[04:11.55]I can't shoot him.
[04:12.83]Oh, I'm such a shithead.
[04:15.13]It's like a blatant spy in front of me.
[04:16.47]I'm trying to shoot him, but I'm, like, blowing the horn.
[04:17.95]The animations last so long.
[04:19.67]I just let my pyro friend die because of that.
[04:22.00]I'm such a bad teammate.
[04:29.84]Oh, no, he's mine.
[04:31.12]Give me...
[04:34.39]Thank God.
[04:35.89]Me and this friendly Demoman.
[04:37.37]We both had our halves of Toichizo.
[04:39.27]Thankfully I won the race so I could switch weapon again.
[04:41.71]Did we really?
[04:42.21]Oh my God.
[04:42.91]I don't even have time to build like a level 3 Sentry.
[04:47.29]Oh no!
[04:48.03]I died at the end because someone crit me with a Conscience Object.
[04:51.13]Fuck.
[04:52.05]A protest sign.
[04:54.70]One second away from capping there when I was just about to blow up the whole room and I just got drilled.
[04:58.80]Shit.
