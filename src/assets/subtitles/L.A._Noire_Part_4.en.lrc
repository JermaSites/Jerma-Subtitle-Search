[02:04.73]Hey, good pickup.
[02:13.46]Well, anyways, hi, guys.
[02:15.38]We're going to play L.A.
[02:16.26]Noire again.
[02:19.32]Because that's just kind of what we're doing.
[02:22.53]We've got a lot of these games that I started and got halfway through.
[02:26.57]I'd like to at least attempt to try to finish them.
[02:33.28]How could I be a substitute teacher if I can't spell unknown?
[02:35.60]Well, here's the thing.
[02:36.47]It's called pressing the keys too fast and not pressing down hard enough on the N. And you graze by it and you keep going.
[02:47.13]That's where 90% of my problems come from when I'm using the computer.
[02:50.85]It's just grazing keys and not pressing down hard enough.
[02:59.50]Making excuses to seem smart.
[03:02.81]I mean, do I need excuses?
[03:05.17]Graduated at the bottom of my class.
[03:08.19]Barely scraped by high school.
[03:14.86]Got like a 2.7 GPA in college.
[03:18.68]And... Got a degree in communication.
[03:26.95]Got a gamer degree in... Blockbuster video.
[03:33.41]I think I did okay, you know?
[03:44.20]I got the boomer degree.
[03:46.38]How does communication work?
[03:48.80]Communication is film, TV, and radio.
[03:53.04]It's, you know, it's mass media.
[03:55.14]That's what it is.
[04:00.80]Fake gamer certificate.
[04:06.96]Boomer jokes were never funny.
[04:11.84]I'm not making them.
[04:12.70]I'm just responding to them.
[04:14.53]Should I stop responding to the boomer jokes?
[04:19.05]Should I do that?
[04:24.76]Let's get that smooth, Jasmine, but yes.
[04:27.30]All the negative comments.
[04:28.68]I don't read just negative comments.
[04:31.36]I read nice ones, too.
[04:34.64]Like, for instance, Smellyboy says, Found the boomer.
[04:44.21]Another one.
[04:48.31]Senpai says, Change outfit, you dirty man.
[04:52.55]I can't read them.
[04:54.82]I can't... King Crawfil says, idiot streamer.
[05:00.00]I'm trying to read good... I don't... I can't read them.
[05:03.76]They're... Play elf bowling, you idiot, you idiot, you eater, you... It's something about... I'm not reading that one.
[05:17.13]Alright, let's go.
[05:17.78]I'm gonna pick up where we left off last night.
[05:22.61]And then, guys, you know, because I've decided, I'm gonna, let's stream, you know what I mean?
[05:28.66]We're gonna be streaming tomorrow as well.
[05:31.52]And judging by how far we get here, we're gonna go tomorrow too?
[05:37.10]So my plan is to go tomorrow, and then I'm gonna take Sunday and Monday off, because I really need to prepare for the green screen, screen, screen, because, listen, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we've got a solid date here now.
[05:51.16]Thursday the 15th is the green screen stream.
[05:58.07]Locked in with the studio.
[06:00.95]Should be a good time. 15.
[06:07.85]So there's going to be a poll that will show up here on tomorrow.
[06:14.36]For tomorrow's stream.
[06:16.02]And it's going to be... You're going to have to vote for your top few favorite meme actions you want me to do.
[06:21.64]Because I'm not doing all of them.
[06:23.34]There's like 15 to 20 options.
[06:24.36]You're going to have to narrow it down to like three.
[06:31.82]So there'll be a poll tomorrow.
[06:33.96]I will give it to you before the stream, during the stream, and after the stream as well.
[06:39.06]And before he streams a blank green background for four hours.
[06:42.25]Oh, but so much work has gone into this.
[06:44.33]That would be the dumbest thing I've ever done.
[06:48.31]Timur, please turn the game volume down.
[06:50.31]My wife can't hear it.
[06:52.09]Turn the game volume down?
[06:55.06]I don't understand.
[06:59.86]So tomorrow is an elf bowling stream.
[07:01.60]It is not.
[07:03.54]I'm not going to play the virus fucking cereal box game.
[07:06.65]Sorry.
[07:12.95]lego island you guys it's not just it's not that easy it's you know it's not that easy I have to like do a virtual machine to for like 25 minutes of content we did see this last night but might as well just get another view
[07:42.01]it's such a bad game of course we will look into it yes I'm aware that it's an election year more like 25 streams of fun keep a hold of your head counselor now is not the time to lose your nerve it would appear that someone has hooked a rose gold wedding ring and matching engagement
[08:10.00]So, to catch everybody up here, there's been a series of murders, wedding rings being carved off of fingers, naked bodies, attacks, death, and I've got to put it all together.
[08:20.42]Play Knack 2.
[08:21.08]I'm not going to play Knack 2.
[08:42.12]Real, Yard, and Pawnbroker.
[08:47.55]And Act 2 is like... You guys are mixing, like, somebody else's joke here.
[08:53.33]You know what I mean?
[08:53.87]Like, that's a funny joke.
[08:54.75]It's a joke, but it's that...
[09:08.58]Like, you want me to go up on stage and do, like, Steve Martin's whole routine and pretend it was me?
[09:13.02]Isn't that the cop who caught the guy that was pretending?
[09:14.88]You know what I mean?
[09:15.52]Like... You want me to, like, steal, like, a comedian's whole routine?
[09:23.09]Alright, let's go to the pawn shop.
[09:29.32]Yes.
[09:30.36]Uh...
[09:38.97]Do a donkey voice.
[09:40.29]No, like, that's the equivalent.
[09:42.23]This is the equivalent of, like... No, I'm not gonna say it, because, like, I don't want to, like, make people... I don't want... No.
[09:47.15]We're gonna move on from this, because I don't want to, like, have... Oh, yeah.
[09:49.91]If he said this out loud, that means I have to say it to this guy.
[09:52.64]That's... But, like... Okay, whatever.
[09:58.44]It's not, like, anything bad.
[09:59.38]That's, like, telling... That's, like... No.
[10:01.66]Never mind.
[10:03.02]I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep my hands clean of this one.
[10:11.57]We'll just leave it at this.
[10:15.39]Dunkey is a very talented, funny comedian, online content creator.
[10:19.69]And he has that, he has a back two joke.
[10:22.43]And, uh, I, that's, that's really funny.
[10:27.23]It's his, he does it.
[10:33.27]This is what happens when you kill your own memes.
[10:43.56]Detectives Phelps and Galloway, LAPD.
[10:46.55]You have a rose gold wedding and engagement ring?
[10:49.27]David Bremner.
[10:51.13]Oh, by the way, half the people in this chat are going to be really disappointed.
[10:54.49]No, I mean half the people that were here last night.
[10:56.34]I got it.
[10:56.74]But not yet.
[10:57.36]Trust me on this.
[11:15.87]Need to wait.
[11:18.53]One more day.
[11:20.21]Because there's something else that I found that is important.
[11:25.37]Isn't that a whiskey?
[11:27.39]That's a whiskey, isn't it?
[11:29.19]What is happening?
[11:30.65]Nothing.
[11:43.17]What is he talking about?
[11:44.11]Well, if you were here last night at the very end of the stream, we talked about something not bad.
[11:49.12]Does this mark mean anything?
[11:51.30]Hallmark.
[11:52.42]Gives you an idea of the quality.
[12:00.01]Okay.
[12:01.31]Whatever.
[12:02.75]What have you got on the guy who brought these in?
[12:05.44]That's far away.
[12:06.24]Can you give us a description of the man who pawned these rings?
[12:11.82]What if he was, like, ugly?
[12:13.36]Really ugly.
[12:13.66]Ugliest guy I've ever seen.
[12:14.38]Okay.
[12:35.27]I like this desk.
[12:36.93]This is the kind of desk that I wish that I had.
[12:41.52]On the right, you get a drawer to put your stuff.
[12:44.14]Enough place for three monitors.
[12:45.82]Computer can go under here.
[12:47.18]And then a big storage thing.
[12:48.94]I wish they sold this.
[12:52.00]I'm not a big fan of the finish.
[12:53.34]I would actually prefer a walnut finish.
[12:59.59]That desk I have is nice.
[13:01.93]But... It's lacking storage.
[13:05.94]Grailyard.
[13:06.42]What's my game of the year so far?
[13:07.50]Red Dead Redemption 2 made it unfair.
[13:26.68]We have a problem.
[13:28.40]I'm not gonna include Red Dead Redemption 2 in my list of games of the year.
[13:36.31]Because that's just cheating.
[13:37.43]It's not fair.
[13:40.27]That's like an S tier.
[13:41.83]That always is number one.
[13:43.01]And then we have to find out what the other ones underneath it are.
[13:45.63]The Dahlia letters are genuine.
[13:47.01]And the man who killed Elizabeth Short may have also killed Deirdre Muller.
[13:52.16]Like if you do a top five and like the golden locked slot up above the top five is Red Dead Redemption 2 Red Dead Redemption 2 is zero?
[14:21.06]Have you played it?
[14:24.03]It's very fun.
[14:27.19]I still have to play God of War.
[14:28.67]That's people talking about how great that was.
[14:33.70]Spider-Man was really good.
[14:35.44]House Flipper.
[14:38.42]And I really do mean that completely not joking.
[14:41.51]Like, I'm not kidding when I say that.
[14:46.79]He does even think that's a joke.
[14:48.17]I mean, it sounds like a joke, but it's not.
[14:57.67]0 is below 1.
[14:58.49]Well, yeah, 0, yeah.
[15:02.61]0 would not be above 1.
[15:06.35]A Way Out.
[15:06.88]A Way Out was a really interesting game that had a really interesting, cool finish.
[15:10.84]But the whole game of A Way Out was a little... It was a little... I don't know.
[15:16.45]The climax of A Way Out was amazing.
[15:20.35]I don't know.
[15:35.20]What else came out this year?
[15:36.62]This is so much further away than the objective.
[15:38.80]By the way, this is like... I don't even want to do this anymore.
[15:41.34]It's too far away.
[15:49.24]What was better?
[15:49.82]Detroit, become human, or a way out?
[15:51.27]Uh... Um...
[16:06.44]I don't know.
[16:06.96]I mean, probably a way out because a way out was something very different.
[16:17.29]It gets an extra notch on the belt for being all different.
[16:28.77]If Detroit Become Human got rid of the other two storylines, and it was just Connor and Hank go on missions together, and it's like a buddy cop game, I would probably think it was way better than it was.
[16:43.48]Don't shoot him.
[16:44.18]Wow, he shot him.
[16:57.83]Why did he start running this way?
[16:59.11]What?
[17:01.67]This isn't like a football game, man.
[17:06.94]You don't have to like... Oh boy.
[17:10.08]Sorry.
[17:10.36]Alright, don't kill this guy.
[17:13.70]I need to apprehend him.
[17:19.49]Killing this guy is not... I need to apprehend the suspect.
[17:23.63]No more code fours.
[17:31.97]I almost shot that guy right there because he had the same clothes on.
[17:34.57]Why is this guy so much faster?
[17:41.03]Okay, here we go.
[17:42.51]Wait, he's not getting in a car?
[17:48.45]He's in the car.
[17:49.77]Which car is he in?
[17:56.12]What's with these people?
[17:57.04]It's a stitch-up!
[18:21.82]I thought he was tr- okay, I thought if you followed him for long enough he was gonna- got in the car and was gonna leave, and then I saw the gunshots and I didn't know which car he was behind, and then it was too late by the time he got behind the car, like, you- the death sentence was already there, so.
[18:46.19]He was there for a solid fi- I doesn't- I- I- I'm sorry.
[18:51.04]But he got behind the car and I was already backing up.
[18:53.16]And I didn't feel like getting out to like pursue him.
[18:56.44]He probably would have shot me and then I would have seen LUL in the chat a hundred times.
[19:00.42]You know?
[19:02.32]I would have got out like, how do I arrest him?
[19:04.70]What's the arrest button?
[19:05.68]What's the arrest button?
[19:06.36]And then he would have shot me in the head and it would have been like LUL.
[19:09.82]Like failed fish.
[19:10.92]Like idiot.
[19:11.50]Guy's dumb.
[19:12.26]Stupid idiot.
[19:12.88]126 IQ.
[19:13.08]I would have looked over and would have saw it.
[19:16.26]So I took it into my own hands and he got in the way.
[19:18.30]So it's just, I'll finish.
[19:34.55]I still saw LUL a hundred times.
[19:37.63]But that was not me intentionally trying to receive LULs.
[19:41.88]Because there's plenty of moments where you can tell.
[19:44.52]I'm intentionally trying to get some LULs out of you guys.
[19:50.34]I would say it's like 30% is intentional LUL moments.
[19:54.81]And the other 70% is unintentional LUL moments.
[20:01.67]And that was one of those.
[20:08.47]Goddammit.
[20:19.67]If we survive this, it's going to be a miracle.
[20:21.93]And I mean, another thing just to briefly bring up, and me saying LUL and you guys, you know, kind of be inceptioning that into your head.
[20:28.95]I got the analytics and the data behind it, and certain companies that contact me, well, how funny is your stream?
[20:35.74]Well, you know, if you take a look at the amount of LULs that happened last night, a lot here, 4,300 LULs.
[20:40.10]I'm here for you, Company B, Company A.
[20:51.32]I mean, I'm gaming analytics right now.
[20:53.48]You know what I'm saying?
[20:59.86]So if any company's ever looking for like a really, really, really funny guy, I mean, I've got to be number one.
[21:06.10]You're crazy.
[21:07.35]I'm crazy.
[21:07.87]It's your fault.
[21:08.49]Like a guy with a gun.
[21:09.75]Behind my back.
[21:11.31]How am I supposed to trust you?
[21:12.39]God damn it.
[21:16.16]Shooter everybody just shoots the person saying sir.
[21:18.86]I think you ought to calm down.
[21:20.54]He's Kenny mind your own goddamn business Why is everybody always on my case?
[21:26.31]Told you Here comes the sprint run away Give it up old man
[21:44.21]Where is he?
[21:45.71]Where is the, where, wait, what?
[21:47.82]Oh, he's right here.
[21:49.22]Okay, okay, okay.
[21:59.19]I got it, okay, did I kill him?
[22:13.03]Come on, code two, code two.
[22:15.67]Car 11K, code four at Olvera Street, but I'll need an ambulance.
[22:19.79]Shot's fired, suspect is down.
[22:23.62]Roger, on your ambulance, 11K, all units be advised, code four at the Olvera Street Plaza.
[22:31.64]Solved that big case.
[22:33.44]Look at all those LULs.
[22:38.88]LUL moments.
[22:43.97]Like isn't Twitch will keep their own metrics and eventually when Twitch implements like top lolul moment of the week I'll be in that compilation and they like they'll have the chat on the side Funny man crazy man German on a five one of our resident top 1000 twitch partners Did something outrageous?
[23:05.27]chasing down an old man in a parking lot and
[23:08.63]He actually ran him over with the car.
[23:10.59]It'd be like Bob Saget.
[23:12.69]When he used to do the voiceovers.
[23:15.72]On home videos.
[23:17.92]Somebody at special will start doing voiceovers.
[23:19.82]And like, oh, hey, it's me.
[23:21.00]I'm the old man.
[23:22.12]Wink, wink.
[23:22.68]Add like fucking barking sounds.
[23:24.12]And funny like baby noises and stuff.
[23:30.42]I'll be on that compilation.
[23:31.32]Because I'll be able to look at the chat and see how many LULs were there.
[23:33.82]I'll be in the top LUL moments of the week.
[23:40.04]Those of you that don't understand that reference... It's pretty specific, and it's pretty old, too.
[23:50.74]Kids in chat never saw... American... Another one of these!
[23:56.44]Too young... Hey, I'm old enough to remember when it wasn't abbreviated to AFV.
[24:02.12]It was America's Funniest Home Videos.
[24:05.25]Not America's Funniest Videos.
[24:10.23]And Bob Saget was the host, and every single clip he did the same baby voice.
[24:16.82]And added comedic effect to every single clip.
[24:19.28]And somebody won at the end.
[24:25.39]Would it be funny to do that?
[24:26.73]Do like a top clips from Twitch?
[24:30.25]And they're already there, but I just voice over them?
[24:33.15]Like Bob Saget used to do?
[24:45.93]Oh yeah, wait, that already... that did already happen.
[24:53.40]Yeah, but like, Ray William Johnson didn't do funny baby voices over all the footage.
[24:59.98]Did he?
[25:00.26]He did?
[25:07.72]I don't remember him doing that.
[25:21.13]He pitch-shifted his voice up.
[25:24.25]Oh, yeah, he did do that.
[25:30.11]I forgot.
[25:30.71]Yeah, he did, like, pitch-shift his voice up and say things.
[25:34.00]He did do the Bob Saget.
[25:35.78]Holy shit.
[25:45.92]Alright, here we go.
[25:48.38]This'll be the third street crime in a row.
[25:53.68]You should have iced those folks.
[25:55.84]You leave no witnesses, you stay out of the park.
[25:57.94]I'm not riding all the way to Santa Ana and then on to Cincinnati with you pissing in my ear.
[26:01.21]But I'm tired of always being on the lam.
[26:02.23]I don't think anyone wants me to pee in their ear.
[26:03.49]I don't have a choice.
[26:04.79]A stick-up charge is still a stick-up charge and I ain't going back inside.
[26:10.27]You think I'd stuck that place up?
[26:11.41]You're in trouble.
[26:11.91]Don't do anything stupid.
[26:16.60]Alright, this one won't be a code 4 because I'm not shooting anybody.
[26:21.96]This one is just pursued.
[26:25.46]Whoops.
[26:34.16]Wow, this is tight.
[26:36.14]Tight corners here.
[26:36.95]I got like a little buggy.
[27:08.67]What is this driving?
[27:14.24]Is this what it looks like from back behind?
[27:16.24]A different angle?
[27:17.38]Me driving?
[27:19.22]It is.
[27:19.62]It has to be.
[27:21.25]See?
[27:23.35]This is just, I'm just watching Mario Kart ghost footage.
[27:26.98]Did somebody just come out of, jump out of the car?
[27:29.48]Hit him, Cole!
[27:30.40]Spit him out!
[27:39.06]Apprehend the suspect.
[27:43.48]Oh, they got in a car accident.
[27:45.60]All right, Jeremy, that's enough reckless driving for you.
[27:50.20]LAPD!
[27:59.36]See?
[28:00.84]They lived.
[28:02.36]Hold on.
[28:04.64]I had nothing to do with that.
[28:08.88]I had nothing to do with it.
[28:11.50]They got in a straight-on head-on collision.
[28:13.61]I didn't do that.
[28:17.51]Are you guys certain that code 4 means they died?
[28:19.75]Or does code 4 mean, like, we got them?
[28:24.99]What does it mean?
[28:27.29]Cole, come on!
[28:31.50]Code 4 means no further assistance.
[28:33.82]That doesn't mean they died.
[28:34.92]You guys are telling me code 4 means dead.
[28:49.09]We got a code 4.
[28:51.49]What?
[28:53.67]Oh, thank god you can't go through windshields.
[28:55.37]Imagine we both fly through the windshield.
[29:13.58]You can fly through the windshield in Red Dead.
[29:15.80]There is no windshield though.
[29:17.74]I'm getting fucking old.
[29:22.06]I'm getting old.
[29:25.33]But seriously, I got like the... I got the body of like a fucking 50 year old man.
[29:33.53]I turned 30 and it's just a light switch flip.
[29:45.22]Am I gonna play Hitman 2?
[29:46.24]Absolutely.
[29:53.77]Why does he not have a webcam?
[29:56.51]I don't understand.
[29:57.71]Why is there no webcam on?
[30:02.99]I wonder.
[30:14.33]Gaffigan voice.
[30:17.23]That really was.
[30:18.17]I really just got possessed by Jim Gaffigan.
[30:44.21]How do I get down there?
[30:47.46]I don't want to drive there.
[30:49.94]Come on.
[30:51.66]Come on, it's right there.
[30:53.96]It's right there.
[30:54.74]There has to be a way I can just jump this.
[30:59.33]It's right here!
[31:10.27]clip through the wall.
[31:11.05]No, I have to drive.
[31:11.59]I have to go right, right, right, right.
[31:14.78]Do my best Donald Trump impression and I will subscribe.
[31:20.70]I've done Trump like a thousand times.
[31:34.75]How do I get over there?
[31:36.53]Am I out of my mind?
[31:39.99]Do I have to go through this gate?
[31:41.57]Okay, well there we go.
[31:43.16]Gimme a break.
[31:46.80]Finally, okay.
[31:47.40]Made it.
[31:47.70]Rail yard.
[32:11.55]Skipper.
[32:11.91]Alright, let's investigate the crime.
[32:14.45]Do an impression of Donkey Kong.
[32:17.05]Well, there's two different Donkey Kongs.
[32:40.96]Hard, isn't it?
[32:41.82]Yeah.
[32:42.84]I look out for all the rail depots.
[32:44.04]There's the Donkey Kong that could talk.
[32:45.60]The Negro, Nelson Gaines, called it in.
[32:47.44]There is tropical freeze.
[32:48.22]I came down here to make sure him and the other guy, Jameson, stuck around.
[32:51.62]Jameson found the body?
[32:53.54]Something like that.
[32:55.06]Guy makes me sick.
[32:56.72]We'll talk to the coroner.
[32:57.87]Keep an eye on both of them.
[33:02.93]All right, let's investigate.
[33:03.71]But yeah, there's when... What have we got here?
[33:09.39]It was when he was just a gorilla.
[33:10.59]Remember he used to go... That's all he did.
[33:12.65]He didn't have any other lines.
[33:14.03]Okay, midnight.
[33:35.50]Okay, let's see if we can... No, you need to go... Just examine.
[33:42.05]No neck mark.
[33:43.51]No rope around the neck on this particular case here.
[33:47.17]Do funny baby voice.
[34:10.60]Funny baby voice.
[34:12.27]What does that mean?
[34:14.19]The ring is gone though.
[34:15.21]He thought about it.
[34:17.09]I'm trying to figure out what it meant.
[34:18.39]The baby voice is the shpee voice.
[34:19.47]No, but it's not though.
[34:43.07]Anything else?
[34:46.49]I can't do anything else.
[34:55.62]That's nothing?
[34:57.00]Where are the markers?
[34:58.78]Where's the this is evidence marker?
[35:00.18]Here's a giant yellow square.
[35:03.24]Somebody put down a giant marker for me.
[35:11.00]Do Christopher walk in?
[35:12.81]Well, okay.
[35:20.47]Dear Evelyn, I hope that this letter finds you in a better way than when you were last parted.
[35:29.31]Bitter words were exchanged.
[35:31.71]You are taking too much liquor.
[35:33.65]This is Bernie Sanders.
[35:35.91]Whoops.
[35:38.66]That's Bernie Sanders.
[35:40.39]I don't know why that happened.
[35:51.80]Uh, but I am not writing to harass.
[35:54.83]I'm writing to apologize.
[35:55.91]I was heartbroken seeing what had become of my little girl and what she is doing to destroy herself.
[36:04.53]Uh, you are destroying your body and, uh, believe me, your soul.
[36:09.00]I can't do it anymore.
[36:11.69]No, no, no, Evelyn, Evelyn, let me, excuse me, excuse me.
[36:15.86]It is harder for me to, no, excuse me.
[36:18.46]Let me finish, excuse me.
[36:20.00]It's harder for me to watch than you can imagine, okay?
[36:24.32]Believe me.
[36:24.66]I can't.
[36:28.04]I can't.
[36:29.76]I can't do it.
[36:30.86]There you go.
[36:36.08]Is that guy gonna subscribe?
[36:44.81]We could go over to the lot and see what they know about her.
[36:47.39]No.
[36:47.65]That's going to be difficult, Cole.
[36:50.41]Keystone Studio lot, close back 41.
[36:52.15]He did it?
[36:52.63]Did I get conned here?
[37:14.71]There we go.
[37:15.15]We got matches with a... looks like some kind of a dress on it.
[37:19.33]Come on.
[37:28.83]You mess with the Germba, you get the perma.
[37:35.81]I'll sub if you finish Oblivion.
[37:38.01]Oh, Doug, I see you in 60 hours.
[37:39.91]This is a chit for personal items, not booze.
[37:43.51]That's like 20 streams from now.
[37:48.65]Okay, two large suitcases.
[37:50.81]Small suitcase, bedroll, pillow, plain bed sheet.
[37:53.91]A hairbrush, bowling pin, statuette, makeup, clothes.
[37:57.96]Is that it?
[37:58.30]I think that's it.
[38:08.46]That's not it.
[38:11.01]Anybody to talk to?
[38:12.51]Did I not...
[38:19.10]Sing the overwatch song I don't even know.
[38:23.86]What are you talking about?
[38:24.91]I already did that I I don't I don't know what you mean
[38:45.42]There's apparently still evidence somewhere.
[38:50.91]Like, are you talking about the song that goes like... That like... That was not... Detective Phelps and Galloway, homicide.
[39:03.57]Can you tell me exactly what happened?
[39:05.25]The thing that plays before every trailer.
[39:07.25]When I saw this man here lying on top of this woman.
[39:11.31]The woman wasn't moving and seemed to be in a bad way.
[39:14.86]What time was this?
[39:16.00]About 7.30 this morning, sir.
[39:18.04]Thanks for your help.
[39:19.04]Have you given Patrolman Hart your details?
[39:20.52]That was horrible.
[39:21.34]Thank you.
[39:22.00]You can go now.
[39:22.58]Does he need to pick up the phone?
[39:29.83]Any other evidence?
[39:35.61]Nope.
[39:40.60]No good to me.
[39:52.47]Do I know what TikTok is?
[39:54.09]Yes, I do.
[39:54.95]I know what TikTok is.
[39:58.77]I've seen plenty of memes.
[40:00.17]I've seen plenty of weird... What are you thinking?
[40:02.96]I'm not... The city keeps tossing us dead bodies.
[40:07.32]We're just running to catch up.
[40:15.40]I'm in touch with the youth.
[40:17.18]I know.
[40:17.56]I just told you I know what it is.
[40:19.74]I don't know anything else.
[40:22.10]Detective Phelps, LAPD homicide.
[40:25.08]John Ferdinand Jameson.
[40:26.86]We need you to answer some questions, John.
[40:29.64]If you don't mind, I prefer Ferdinand.
[40:31.52]Don't push your luck, knucklehead.
[40:33.32]What were you doing to the body, Ferdinand?
[40:35.56]Are you sure you won't be upset?
[40:38.56]Try me, Ferdinand.
[40:42.46]I was kissing her.
[40:43.97]Whoa!
[40:45.33]It's not against the law.
[40:46.21]Shut up.
[40:46.55]There's no law against it.
[40:47.31]Take your beating like a man.
[40:49.20]Turn out your pockets, Ferdinand.
[40:51.56]What's he got in your pockets?
[40:55.84]You fucking asshole.
[41:00.32]Classic Carmine.
[41:02.24]I've seen this lipstick before.
[41:07.61]Is this yours, Ferdinand?
[41:09.21]No.
[41:10.47]I found it near her purse.
[41:12.59]I thought she could use some lipstick.
[41:13.99]Rusty, stop!
[41:15.25]Here he goes again.
[41:16.99]This guy is fucked.
[41:20.59]Alright, well... You, uh, went through her purse?
[41:24.43]It wasn't like she needed it.
[41:26.25]I took a look.
[41:27.59]Let's get fucking Pee Wee Herman.
[41:36.96]Is he posing for pictures?
[41:44.48]He's posing for this.
[41:46.66]Okay, uh...
[41:50.00]That's like a straight-on scare.
[41:51.28]Okay.
[41:51.38]Well, that's not true.
[42:15.77]Why didn't you report the body, Jameson?
[42:17.51]Do you know how this is going to look to a jury?
[42:20.11]A jury?
[42:21.29]What gives?
[42:23.27]I could tell that she was dead.
[42:24.55]A jury?
[42:25.61]What are you talking about?
[42:27.33]She wasn't here then.
[42:28.35]Let me belt him again.
[42:30.41]You're under arrest, Jameson.
[42:32.05]We'll see how this plays out.
[42:33.71]Until then, you can think a little on how you'd like to be treated if you were found dead.
[42:37.37]I'm telling you it's not illegal.
[42:39.17]Me and some friends of mine...
[42:42.65]All right.
[42:44.04]Call it in.
[42:44.58]Did I drink?
[42:44.88]No.
[42:45.00]Why do I have to be drunk if I do something weird?
[43:13.51]See?
[43:13.69]This is... Look.
[43:14.03]This is... coffee.
[43:14.47]From Starbucks.
[43:17.69]Thanks for your help.
[43:45.60]Alright, so now we gotta go... Haha, pilly voice.
[43:49.72]Jeremiah, are you drunk?
[43:58.92]Get drunk and do something weird.
[44:00.88]Wait, wait, relax?
[44:01.98]What are you... Alright, crime scene.
[44:08.38]Wait.
[44:11.76]Isn't that where I'm already here?
[44:14.16]Do I need to come back here?
[44:15.26]Did I miss something?
[44:15.88]Hold on.
[44:35.64]We should do a drawing stream where I draw stuff from bit messages.
[44:38.72]I'm so bad at drawing.
[44:39.68]That would be embarrassing.
[44:43.07]Oh, hold on.
[44:50.71]Alright, here comes the Legend of Zelda.
[44:54.81]You opened up a treasure chest and you got something inside!
[44:57.11]Nope.
[45:10.18]That's it?
[45:10.74]What else is there for me to do here?
[45:14.00]This is the crime scene.
[45:17.37]Oh, hold on.
[45:20.55]It doesn't appear to be connected.
[45:23.51]What the fuck?
[45:26.86]Once the music stops, you're done.
[45:32.84]Yeah, but what?
[45:34.16]Did I miss something on the body?
[45:37.66]No.
[45:50.60]Back to the note?
[45:52.98]Wait, did I not read this?
[45:57.06]Is this something on the other side?
[45:57.98]Nothing on here.
[46:04.07]Read the letter.
[46:05.21]Didn't I do that already?
[46:18.83]Oh.
[46:19.15]I opened it before.
[46:26.38]Like, I already did that, but I didn't, like, scroll all the way down.
[46:29.08]There it is.
[46:32.34]Okay.
[46:43.57]Locations.
[46:44.25]Let's go to the back.
[46:46.81]Set as destination.
[46:50.07]Dangus.
[46:51.55]Sorry, I opened it and read it and looked at it.
[46:53.77]But I didn't go all the way down to the bottom of the paper to get the you looked at the clue thing to pop up.
[47:02.34]I'm sorry.
[47:04.30]I'm sorry.
[47:05.20]Yeah.
[47:05.32]Yeah, I read about that.
[47:09.92]Those people are starving.
[47:11.16]They can't do that.
[47:13.22]Want to sell the food to fund the civil war against the communists.
[47:17.19]Really?
[47:17.49]I guess that's okay then.
[47:21.79]Go through!
[47:23.73]Oh, what?
[47:24.29]Is this even a Rockstar game?
[47:26.53]Did Rockstar have anything to do with this game?
[47:27.95]Because that chain link fence goes down.
[47:29.59]That one does.
[47:32.09]Rockstar published the game.
[47:45.03]Rockstar.
[47:45.33]Sure, let's do it.
[47:45.85]I can't turn down a crime.
[47:46.93]I can't turn down a chase guy around and then shoot him.
[47:48.91]There's a dev in the chat.
[47:56.79]What's up, man?
[48:16.90]And remarkably, not one person was injured.
[48:33.73]Really enjoying your game, though, man.
[48:36.05]Dev in the chat.
[48:37.15]That's crazy, man.
[48:38.82]What's up, dude?
[48:41.38]Hey, what's going on, kid?
[48:42.72]What's up, man?
[48:51.33]So I got a question for you dude, what's up dude?
[48:56.33]How long did it take you to make some of the animations in the game?
[49:01.79]Some of the facial animations from the last cutscene dude.
[49:11.36]Took a couple months?
[49:12.38]Nice kid.
[49:21.30]No, I can't... Son of a... Ah, son of a god!
[49:30.01]Can I really not do anything?
[49:31.17]This is just, what, a lookout point?
[49:32.93]What's the purpose of this?
[49:38.65]So what next?
[49:45.10]So this is Dev in the chat.
[49:46.74]First of all, I mean, what's up, dude?
[49:49.08]What's going on, man?
[49:50.18]I'm happy to have you, man.
[49:52.98]Uh, what happened to, um, the part up here?
[49:55.50]Why would you walk back in the path?
[50:08.66]Is it up there?
[50:09.30]Oh, man.
[50:18.23]There is no joke.
[50:18.93]I'm just pretending to be, like, a streamer that sees a dev in the chat.
[50:37.68]For a joke, no.
[50:39.12]For pretend.
[50:40.60]Why don't you come on out, Jimmy?
[50:42.46]I'm pretending.
[50:42.82]I won't let them hurt you.
[50:44.18]Not my honey boy.
[50:45.96]Wait, oh, I remember this one.
[50:47.02]This is the guy... Now shut the hell up!
[50:48.80]This is the shotgun guy, okay.
[50:50.44]You shut the hell up!
[50:51.61]Is that the lady of the house?
[50:57.27]It's a nice story.
[50:58.61]Two old lovebirds just moved in together.
[51:00.83]But they had a falling out, and he chased her across the yard with a 12-gauge.
[51:05.01]Now, Tim Ross...
[51:12.72]Let's go.
[51:15.62]Multi-kill.
[51:20.62]Godlike.
[51:27.62]Shut down.
[51:28.36]Shut down.
[51:30.00]Shut down.
[51:30.97]How do you do that guy's voice?
[51:38.38]God-like.
[51:39.46]No.
[51:43.32]God-like.
[51:45.44]God-like.
[51:46.88]That's not how it is, is it?
[52:02.43]Frog-like.
[52:06.64]How do you make those noises with your mouth?
[52:08.76]Well, first of all, what's up, dude?
[52:10.30]What's up, kid?
[52:11.10]Thanks for coming in.
[52:14.36]Or we'll... You shape your throat in directions.
[52:17.83]Thanks, but hey, what's up, man?
[52:26.59]I get the point.
[52:38.19]That mailbox went flying.
[52:47.07]This is why people randomly hate you?
[52:50.71]What?
[52:51.25]Who hates me?
[52:55.83]What?
[52:56.43]Who randomly hates me?
[53:16.92]Gently... I don't... I don't know... I don't want people to hate me.
[53:33.30]But at the same time... If I wanna... If I'm gonna say godlike in a frog voice, I'm gonna do it.
[53:39.64]And nothing's going to stop me from doing it.
[53:41.38]You know?
[53:46.41]Evelyn Summers, what is it now?
[53:49.50]You knew Evelyn?
[53:50.50]As well as I wanted to know Evelyn.
[53:51.84]Did somebody really hate me because I did a frog voice for five seconds?
[53:54.76]Imagine drinks, never had any money.
[53:56.94]That'd be a really weird reason to hate somebody.
[53:59.42]Did she ever tell you where she was staying?
[54:01.76]I don't know.
[54:03.00]I think she was living rough.
[54:04.32]She had that kind of shtunk about her.
[54:05.48]Yeah, I went to this guy's stream and he did like a frog voice.
[54:08.48]I fucking hate this guy.
[54:09.96]All right, what are we doing?
[54:16.17]What's your name?
[54:17.97]Grosvenor McCaffrey.
[54:19.60]Mind if I ask you some questions, Mr. McCaffrey?
[54:22.40]I'm just a starving writer, detective.
[54:25.58]What do you want to ask about?
[54:26.94]Evelyn Summers and why she was found beaten and strangled in the rail depot on Santa Fe.
[54:33.13]Okay.
[54:34.71]I see your point.
[54:36.85]How well did you know her?
[54:38.97]I can't say that I knew her.
[54:40.67]It was more like I was aware of her.
[54:47.44]What was your last contact with a bitch?
[54:49.92]That's bullshit.
[54:58.69]Maybe not.
[54:59.05]I mean, you're moving around a lot, though, but he's not darting his eyes around.
[55:16.85]Do you want to get dragged into this, McCaffrey?
[55:18.61]Do you want us to get interested in you?
[55:20.83]She hung out with this powder puff, James Tiernan.
[55:24.43]They haunted the public library together.
[55:26.87]How well do you know James Tiernan?
[55:29.01]I know he works some kind of plebeian job at Rawlings Bowling Alley.
[55:35.56]Rawlings?
[55:36.58]I know that place.
[55:37.46]Corner of 9th and Grand.
[55:39.28]A lot of cops bowl there on Tuesday nights.
[55:44.18]Nobody hates me, right?
[55:45.02]Like, nobody hates me here?
[55:45.88]Just making sure.
[55:47.02]Do you have a criminal record, Mr. McCaffrey?
[56:02.63]Nothing serious.
[56:05.15]Some people might.
[56:16.37]It was a fucking joke.
[56:18.87]But I'm rebounding the joke.
[56:21.50]See, I had a joke force-filled up.
[56:28.30]Alright, well, hold on.
[56:31.20]What the fuck did you just say?
[56:58.87]He's doing a lot of blinking.
[56:59.81]Do you want to save me some time, or do you want me to look up your file?
[57:08.91]Industrial disputes, strikes, workers' rights, that kind of thing.
[57:16.03]A regular fifth columnist.
[57:18.49]Nice to meet you, comrade.
[57:19.93]So I was going to do a thing, and I might have some time to do it.
[57:23.63]Mr. McCaffrey.
[57:26.01]where I was going to do a, um, I wonder if there's an extension I could use to do it.
[57:31.85]It'd kind of be fun.
[57:33.19]But this would just, the reason why I can't is because this would just be the lie detector stream again, but a different version of it.
[57:40.04]Or I would just put the prompts on the screen and just sit in the right position and have you guys interview me.
[57:45.92]But we already, like, we already did that.
[57:49.96]Okay.
[57:52.46]Um, let's go.
[58:06.53]Let's go to the bar.
[58:08.12]Wait, we already went to the bar.
[58:09.12]There's something else here.
[58:16.92]Yeah, do the same camera angle and sound effects.
[58:18.62]That would take some time to put together, but it'd be fun.
[58:21.90]Did I miss something here?
[58:22.66]Go to a casino for a stream?
[58:26.74]Like, I... You're not allowed to film in a casino.
[58:38.50]You'll get a hand swat down on your hand.
[58:41.32]I got an idea, though.
[58:54.93]Why don't I just, like, run my own casino from my house?
[58:57.99]You know what I mean?
[59:00.31]I could, like, instead of... I could try to make some extra money on the side by inviting people over to play, like, blackjack in my... This is a Will Ferrell movie, never mind.
[59:20.19]I don't think I can do anything else here.
[59:21.29]I mean, there's this person here, but I don't think I can talk to him.
[59:27.49]Okay, well, I didn't think I could.
[59:28.79]Okay.
[59:58.81]Okay.
[59:59.13]What's next?
[60:01.66]Uh, the liquor store.
[60:02.44]I don't know what I'm missing here, but I don't know what it is, so we're just gonna go.
[60:07.94]You hate the new Wendy's ad.
[60:09.13]What is the Wendy?
[60:09.71]What is it?
[60:11.77]Let me guess.
[60:15.69]Two close friends sitting at, inside, eating in the restaurant.
[60:20.81]Which, by the way, that very never, very rarely does that happen.
[60:24.10]I don't know what it is with fast food companies where they depict, like, whole people going in, whole families and friends, like, having, like, getting together and sitting around, like, a big table and eating McDonald's.
[60:36.22]That, no one does that.
[60:39.34]That's first, that's the first mistake.
[60:41.04]Phelps!
[60:44.63]Oh, people.
[60:46.57]And the second mistake is people being excited about peeling off stickers that give you, like, 20 cents off of a large soda.
[60:54.05]Like, oh, man, yeah, bro, I won!
[60:55.79]And they hold it up, and it's like, oh, me too!
[60:57.69]I won a nugget!
[60:59.47]You rip it off, and you're like, I don't fucking care.
[61:01.19]You never use it, because you throw it in the trash.
[61:02.79]You never bring it back.
[61:05.82]What can I do for you?
[61:07.20]LAPD, Phelps and Galloway.
[61:09.34]We're making inquiries into the murder of Evelyn Summers.
[61:13.36]Evelyn?
[61:14.62]She's dead?
[61:15.54]You knew Evelyn Summers, Mr.?
[61:17.74]Robbins.
[61:19.00]Yes, I knew Evelyn.
[61:21.02]I was a good friend of her ex-husband.
[61:23.15]She kept some of her stuff here.
[61:24.37]Yeah, boardwalk and park place.
[61:25.79]Collect them both and you get a jet.
[61:28.11]You get a million dollars.
[61:30.05]They don't even print those, you know.
[61:33.43]They don't even print boardwalk.
[61:35.71]They print park place.
[61:37.07]And park place is so common...
[61:39.74]Everybody gets Park Place, and then they go, oh, shit, dude, I just need Boardwalk, and they don't even print Boardwalk.
[61:44.23]It's not even printed.
[61:48.53]The CEO of McDonald's, like, gets on a plane to some random town in Iowa, and he, like, slips Boardwalk on, he slips one of the drinks down into fucking some random place, and the next person in line gets it.
[62:05.77]There's one printed.
[62:14.36]All right, what am I looking for here?
[62:21.48]Bowling pin.
[62:28.28]Rawlings Bowling Alley.
[62:29.58]Rawlings Bowling.
[62:30.46]Maybe Evelyn did something other than drink in her spare time.
[62:33.06]So she was a bowler.
[62:39.25]The CEO slipped.
[62:40.09]The CEO just like goes into a random store with... It's in a case!
[62:45.43]That large McDonald's fucking soda with the boardwalk on it is in a locked gold case that only the CEO is allowed to touch.
[62:54.97]And he, in his weird fucking creepy tower, throws a dart at the board in the United States and picks the one place that he's gonna go sneak and put like a fake mustache on and drop off the golden case.
[63:10.47]Evelyn Summers.
[63:10.85]1938.
[63:10.91]Okay.
[63:11.05]You've said too much already.
[63:15.77]Is the volume low?
[63:16.45]I'll turn it up for you.
[63:17.89]Picture.
[63:46.00]Okay.
[63:48.30]Is that it?
[63:54.11]No.
[64:02.51]Evelyn was reading Aristotle?
[64:05.08]Aristotle Metaphysics.
[64:08.06]What else is in here?
[64:12.50]And she was borrowing books from Grosvenor McCaffrey.
[64:17.47]Can I read?
[64:22.14]Yes.
[64:22.88]Yes, I know how to read.
[64:24.32]Thank you.
[64:26.14]Okay.
[64:26.92]Ronald McDonald hates you because you said all those mean things about McDonald's.
[64:38.55]I didn't say anything mean about McDonald's.
[64:43.10]What did I say bad about McDonald's?
[64:44.48]I was just speaking candidly in my opinion of the contest of the Monopoly contest.
[64:51.40]I didn't say it was bad.
[64:52.44]I eat McDonald's.
[64:56.78]McDonald's is fine.
[64:58.18]It tastes good.
[64:59.12]Big Mac, number one.
[64:59.94]I mean, you really can't beat a number one, I don't think.
[65:12.44]Big Macs are awful?
[65:13.98]No, but I don't think so.
[65:18.64]Number two, the two single cheeseburgers.
[65:20.74]I mean, it's hard to argue.
[65:23.59]It's hard to argue with facts, okay?
[65:26.55]The number one from McDonald's is probably the best fast food item.
[65:33.46]Besides that, you're talking about the Wendy's crispy chicken sandwich.
[65:36.16]No offense, but having cops in the store scares away customers.
[65:38.73]The Wendy's crispy chicken sandwich or the Burger King long chicken sandwich.
[65:44.93]I mean, I think those are tied for first place.
[65:48.99]Gentlemen, I have a store to run.
[65:51.52]What are we doing?
[65:54.04]We're trying to account for everyone's movements yesterday.
[65:56.32]The thing is, Burger King sucks, okay?
[65:57.92]Burger King doesn't do anything good anymore.
[65:59.98]Let's pick up some of our things.
[66:02.58]Burger King just goes, food sucks really bad.
[66:06.26]So let's just dump a bunch of sauce and bacon on every sandwich.
[66:09.49]And that's how they get customers, and it tastes good.
[66:21.91]I'm surprised Burger King is still in business.
[66:25.07]Look, I don't hate Burger King.
[66:26.95]It tastes fine.
[66:28.31]I ate Burger King like two weeks ago, and I was like, oh, this is good.
[66:32.52]But I mean, you can't, and Taco Bell is in this here too.
[66:38.94]The cheesy gordita crunch beats the Big Mac in a one-to-one fight, right?
[66:44.31]But if the Big Mac has the number two in the corner as a tag team, nothing else on the whole Taco Bell menu is worth eating.
[66:50.07]You know what I'm saying?
[66:52.13]So one-on-one fight, cheesy gordita crunch will win every time.
[66:55.31]No offense, but having cops in the store scares away customers.
[67:00.89]What about KFC?
[67:03.65]Top of that, you... Chick-fil-A, you... No, no, guys, guys, guys.
[67:08.91]Like, you can't bring in, like, the higher tiered fast food places.
[67:13.39]They're in different weight classes.
[67:16.25]Like, the featherweight doesn't fight the heavyweight.
[67:18.21]You know what I'm saying?
[67:19.11]They're in different weight classes.
[67:23.88]No, KFC's not at a higher tier.
[67:25.32]Chick-fil-A is a higher tier.
[67:27.24]Arby's is a higher tier.
[67:34.55]I'm not putting KFC in high tier.
[67:36.16]I'm putting KFC in the, in the other, in the... Gentlemen, I have a store to run.
[67:39.94]Arby's is garbage.
[67:41.36]But it's like, it's, it's, but they have fresh turkey, okay?
[67:44.60]There's fresh turkey at Arby's.
[67:46.24]They don't have that at McDonald's.
[67:49.38]What was the question?
[67:50.39]I don't even remember.
[67:51.13]I don't know what he even said.
[67:55.67]Can I review the information?
[68:02.67]KFC is good.
[68:03.47]You're all idiots.
[68:09.03]You're all idiots.
[68:13.73]No, I'm not saying that.
[68:15.48]I'm saying what somebody said.
[68:23.78]I was quoting what somebody else said.
[68:28.16]gentlemen I've okay I'm just gonna pick one I don't know what he did but he looks like he's telling the truth any idea where the money came from she didn't mention it but she did say the booze was a present for a boy she said they had been fighting and she had to make it up to him okay
[68:54.43]I don't, I don't, KFC is good.
[68:55.95]What's wrong with KFC?
[68:58.71]How many people will be sad she's gone?
[69:00.41]It's not at the same quality and tier of, like, uh, give me some higher tier, like, fast food places.
[69:09.41]You've got, um, you've got Arby's.
[69:16.00]I'm not paying attention anymore.
[69:18.18]Fuck.
[69:18.96]Why does this have to happen?
[69:19.98]I'm gonna lose this case.
[69:25.34]Fresh turkey.
[69:30.30]I've only had Arby's one time.
[69:32.82]I have no opinion on Arby's.
[69:40.21]What did he say?
[69:44.60]I got the impression that Evelyn had been sleeping rough of late.
[69:47.54]This is why people hate you.
[69:48.34]It would be difficult for me to have her stay.
[69:50.79]Why am I shilling it?
[69:51.73]I'm just, I'm not.
[69:52.31]Her mother was trying to get her back on the straight and narrow.
[69:54.65]Look, I already told you.
[69:55.67]She's old now.
[69:55.95]The number one and the number two for McDonald's.
[69:58.25]To be honest, you have to have a good reason to want to get back on it.
[70:01.43]Very difficult to beat on their own.
[70:04.23]Unless you're a cheeser, go do the crunch.
[70:09.23]I got them both right.
[70:13.75]Do you know a friend of Evelyn's by the name of McCaffrey?
[70:16.87]Not personally.
[70:22.06]This guy's just telling the truth, isn't he?
[70:27.48]No, he's not.
[70:30.34]We're struggling for leads, Robbins.
[70:32.76]Did she know McCaffrey?
[70:34.72]She idolized him.
[70:37.97]From what I gather, the feeling was far from mutual.
[70:41.43]Streaming admits to eating dog food tier fast food on stream.
[70:48.07]It's all bad.
[70:51.42]None of it's like any good.
[70:53.34]I got them all correct.
[70:59.00]I'd like to make arrangements for the funeral.
[71:01.62]You think I could get in touch with Evelyn's mother?
[71:04.06]Put in a call to the watch commander.
[71:05.46]What's my favorite brand of chicken nugget?
[71:07.38]He'll be trying to reach the next of kin.
[71:08.84]Well, I bred my own chicken nuggets.
[71:13.16]And I make them from scratch.
[71:14.60]Evelyn never hurt anybody.
[71:16.80]Not Wendy's.
[71:17.24]Okay.
[71:17.38]So, we need to go...
[71:44.23]Chick-fil-A, but I don't have a Chick-fil-A.
[71:46.63]I don't eat Chick-fil-A.
[71:48.83]Chick-fil-A, at least, I don't know if there's any in Las Vegas, but in Massachusetts, I think there was one Chick-fil-A in the entire state of Massachusetts.
[71:58.66]You know what I mean?
[71:59.64]Like it wasn't available.
[72:01.88]All right, let's go to the bowling alley.
[72:08.30]We just, like, learned that.
[72:10.60]It's my favorite new place in Vegas to eat.
[72:28.29]Uh, boy, I could never tell you.
[72:32.57]Some of the best restaurants I've ever eaten are here.
[72:35.94]So I can't tell you.
[72:39.42]I mean, Gordon Ramsay's steak was probably the best piece of meat I've ever eaten.
[72:45.52]So, I mean, it's that.
[72:56.63]It just was.
[72:58.19]I can't just be like, well, you know.
[73:01.05]It was the best piece of red meat I've probably ever had.
[73:08.46]Hello, Rusty.
[73:10.06]Two on your usual lane?
[73:13.82]I'm Detective Phelps.
[73:15.40]Homicide.
[73:16.28]You must be new.
[73:18.57]What's your shoe size?
[73:19.69]More like shoe things.
[73:23.17]You got a guy who works here by the name of Tiernan?
[73:25.53]Sure we do.
[73:27.41]He's a pin setter.
[73:29.85]Clears the jams, works the gutters.
[73:34.27]Go right in.
[73:35.93]What a great old lady actress.
[73:37.65]That's what I'm going to do.
[73:38.77]I'm going to be... When I get to be like 60, 70, like 75 years old, I want to be the old man at the desk in movies and TV shows.
[74:06.36]Alright, did she say he was like back here?
[74:07.82]I just don't know how to dance to bebop.
[74:10.20]Or do I have to go like down the lanes?
[74:12.39]Is he like in the back?
[74:13.29]That broad has socks in it for zero.
[74:14.85]You want a tip?
[74:16.85]Do I have to like run down the alley?
[74:29.51]He's like, where did she say he just was?
[74:31.71]I'm sorry, we've been talking about fast food.
[74:33.47]I don't even know what the case is anymore.
[74:38.30]The women don't find you handsome, they should only find you handy.
[74:47.71]Tiernan!
[74:48.87]LAPD!
[74:49.09]Here we go.
[75:01.27]Uh-oh.
[75:02.70]Well, at least we got the camera on his face.
[75:04.54]We know what he looks like.
[75:09.80]What are you waiting for?
[75:10.90]Get after him!
[75:12.04]We might go faster if we weren't carrying the extra weight.
[75:15.99]Wow.
[75:16.99]These are flashy cars to be parked outside of bowling alley.
[75:19.71]The lanes attract a fast-living individual with money to burn.
[75:23.85]Or a middle-aged individual with the need to feel hero.
[75:26.55]Yeah.
[75:28.65]Keep it steady and I'll try to bust his tires!
[75:35.48]Hit him!
[75:36.24]Clean this asshole off the road!
[75:38.34]So now I have to hit him because you couldn't do your job.
[75:41.38]Don't go to sleep on me!
[75:42.62]Get me back in close!
[75:45.98]So I'll take care of him is what you're saying.
[75:48.58]Hit him Cole!
[75:49.52]Spit him out!
[75:52.40]Another runner.
[75:53.50]At least we've got a suspect.
[75:55.10]Why do they always run?
[75:56.26]I'm sure we've got the wrong person in more than one of these homicides.
[75:59.74]Why do they always run?
[76:04.90]That's not him spinning out.
[76:06.06]That's him just dropping through the park.
[76:07.86]Okay.
[76:10.38]If this isn't the killer, we can at least get him for reckless endangerment.
[76:13.50]That's unless he runs into a wall and saves us all the trouble.
[76:16.13]This car is going to explode.
[76:21.42]Oh, looks like we're going into the tunnel.
[76:23.19]God damn it, he'll kill himself.
[76:25.43]Alright, knock him into the train.
[76:26.75]Damn it.
[76:27.43]That's the end of that.
[76:34.19]It's about fucking time.
[76:37.81]Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up.
[76:42.73]Put your hands in the air!
[76:52.69]Why is he in a train conductor uniform?
[77:06.76]He isn't?
[77:08.84]What?
[77:09.56]That's what he was wearing.
[77:13.59]So what does that mean?
[77:15.17]So that's the suspect.
[77:16.95]So now we've got...
[77:19.69]I don't know why the bar is still on here, but now we have to go to the police station.
[77:44.32]Is Mario wearing a conductor's uniform?
[77:48.63]Well, Mario has overalls, but not a train conductor's hat.
[77:53.45]That's what was really completing that for me, was the train conductor hat.
[78:11.26]God, you're gonna kill us!
[78:13.69]What happened to that lady?
[78:14.65]Is that lady alive?
[78:24.03]Who killed this lady?
[78:25.07]Uh, okay.
[78:31.57]Well, I don't know.
[78:33.01]Interesting.
[78:35.68]You did.
[78:36.12]No, I didn't.
[78:37.02]She fell down.
[78:42.22]I did not.
[78:42.62]I ran into the medium.
[78:43.52]I didn't kill anybody.
[78:49.52]I'll do that.
[78:54.86]Is somebody going to tell us what the hell is going on?
[78:56.56]Is anybody going to tell us what the heck is happening here?
[78:59.99]Hey, any of you guys down here want to tell us what the heck is going on down here?
[79:03.31]Ray and Mal have some concerns over the Henry and Moller cases, which I don't want aired outside of this room.
[79:09.05]The evidence is solid, Captain.
[79:11.17]I agree, Rusty.
[79:12.33]It's just that corpses keep piling up.
[79:14.52]Copycats.
[79:16.23]I've been banging the same drum, but the notes and the lipstick messages.
[79:20.73]Evelyn Summers, Cartel Classic Carmite.
[79:23.57]Each woman, same brand, same color.
[79:26.76]Theresa Terrelson didn't have a lipstick message.
[79:28.68]The lipstick murderer.
[79:29.62]Technically, you're right, Rusty.
[79:30.90]She didn't have any lipstick, but she did have a message.
[79:34.04]We found it beneath her dress, scraped with a sharp stick.
[79:37.00]What did it say?
[79:37.92]You sure you want to know, Ray?
[79:41.16]As far as we can be sure, it said, cunt BD.
[79:44.85]That's one way of looking at it.
[79:46.99]Looking at what?
[79:48.69]Content is all about access, Phelps.
[79:51.31]You're married, so yours is mortgage.
[79:53.65]Some of us like to pay by installments.
[79:55.77]This guy doesn't like to pay at all.
[79:59.03]Why are you so angry, Mal?
[80:00.11]Because I just had to fire one of my assistants.
[80:03.78]He was a friend of Jameson's.
[80:05.18]God knows what he might have been up to.
[80:07.62]Captain, we have good leads in the Summers case.
[80:10.34]But it's up to you to decide how we proceed.
[80:12.64]Keep this under your hat for now.
[80:15.02]Follow up on Evelyn Summers.
[80:16.94]I want daily reports.
[80:27.64]I'm back.
[80:28.20]Alright, I was just in the bathroom.
[80:29.72]What'd I miss?
[80:30.14]We got our orders.
[80:31.28]Back to the Summers case.
[80:33.36]I'm just kidding.
[80:34.50]I'm just kidding.
[80:35.28]You know what I mean?
[80:36.06]I'm just kidding.
[80:38.76]Trace address on the Governor's McCaffery.
[80:41.48]Well, you don't see that every day.
[80:50.44]I'm just looking for a phone.
[80:51.61]It's apparently here.
[80:52.31]Where's your phone?
[80:54.57]Where's the police phone?
[81:00.43]Operator, message for KGPL.
[81:04.36]Putting you through now.
[81:08.08]Phelps, batch 1247.
[81:08.78]I'm going to get 1247 tattooed on my back.
[81:14.08]I need an address for a Grosvenor McCaffrey.
[81:18.15]Grosvenor McCaffrey.
[81:21.20]Apartment 6, 126 Yale Street, between Ord and Alpine.
[81:27.30]Thanks, ma'am.
[81:29.40]Okay, investigate the apartment.
[81:42.21]What happened to the car?
[81:43.03]Ah, there it is.
[81:43.68]He's already in it.
[81:46.73]O-G-F-6-5-8.
[81:48.03]I'm gonna get that tattooed on my back.
[81:50.09]That guy definitely... These people all got hit.
[81:52.75]All of them got run over.
[82:15.58]I'm gonna get the German 985 tattooed on my tongue So every time I brush my teeth, I'm reminded of who I... what my channel is Shortcut possible, maybe?
[82:34.36]Does this break?
[82:37.30]No
[82:43.97]I can probably stuff through here.
[82:45.11]What are you doing?
[82:47.17]What are you doing?
[82:47.75]Get out of here.
[82:48.65]Get away from me.
[82:51.37]That's just big enough for the car, isn't it?
[82:53.37]Come on.
[82:54.82]It's like the baby toys.
[82:55.96]Whatever.
[83:03.34]Hold on.
[83:12.05]Can I do it?
[83:12.67]Let's see.
[83:14.32]J-E-R-M-A-9-8-5.
[83:18.54]I could do it.
[83:19.48]I could get J-E-R-M-A-9-8-5 on the front of my knuckles here.
[83:22.91]I put them together and it'll say J-E-R-M-A-9-8-5.
[83:25.01]I could hold both my hands up straight, like high five.
[83:33.59]And instead of a high five on my fingers, it's just J-E-R-M-A-9-8-5.
[84:03.61]I'm not gonna do that.
[84:04.73]Why would... I'm not going to do that.
[84:24.39]Now we're gonna find... Wait, hold on.
[84:25.57]I was gonna look at the list of people.
[84:30.89]Apparently not.
[84:32.35]Okay, it was on the other side.
[84:33.55]Where's McCaffery?
[84:35.33]McCaffery is in apartment six.
[84:36.69]Apartment six.
[84:47.49]Six.
[84:48.67]It's kind of hard to see.
[84:49.79]It's dark.
[84:51.33]Four.
[84:59.46]Two.
[85:01.65]One.
[85:01.79]I don't have to go up, do I?
[85:07.11]Three?
[85:07.39]If I have to go up the stairs, wouldn't this be, like, eleven?
[85:11.48]Or, like, different floors?
[85:13.26]No?
[85:17.58]Level two.
[85:18.84]Aye, come on, man.
[85:21.76]What is that?
[85:26.82]Doesn't look like anybody's home.
[85:28.54]Kick it, Phelps.
[85:31.23]Okay.
[85:36.01]God forbid you need to take the stairs.
[85:37.23]I'm not complaining about the stairs.
[85:38.35]I'm just complaining about the fact that it should be 101, 102, 103, 104, 201, 202, 203, 204.
[85:41.58]Here's the bottom part of that letter.
[85:43.42]The letter we found beside the body.
[86:00.69]At the very least, I'd say it ties McCaffrey to the scene.
[86:04.30]Okay.
[86:08.32]Anything else?
[86:10.68]A book?
[86:11.44]Ooh, it's also another... This isn't what we're... Critical theory.
[86:22.11]Well, there's...
[86:24.47]I will say that the criminals have been very, very bad at not leaving the bloody clothes and murder weapon on the ground in their apartment.
[86:36.24]At least put it in the closet.
[86:37.98]Specifically the tire irons.
[86:49.05]Who are you guys?
[86:50.39]What are you doing in here?
[86:51.17]We're from the LAPD, ma'am.
[86:52.81]Do you know where we might find McCaffrey?
[86:54.83]I'm his neighbor.
[86:56.59]Is he in trouble?
[86:57.57]Look, lady, we need to find him, and in a hurry.
[87:00.66]Are you gonna give me trouble?
[87:01.78]He has a pigeon coop up on the roof.
[87:05.28]He spends his mornings up there when he's been drinking.
[87:07.50]How do we get up there?
[87:08.32]He drinks with pigeons?
[87:09.42]Down the hall and up the stairs.
[87:12.34]It's kind of... It's kind of badass, actually.
[87:16.34]Like, getting drunk with pigeons.
[87:20.34]Change the outfit again.
[87:21.46]Why?
[87:21.68]I want to be Officer Phelps.
[87:28.78]So we're going to go up on the roof.
[87:35.29]That way, stupid.
[87:43.68]Rooms 9 and 10.
[87:44.88]Room 11.
[87:46.32]No, that's not it.
[87:47.60]We gotta go up.
[87:48.24]We are at the top.
[87:52.72]But what?
[87:53.56]Out the window?
[87:54.24]No.
[87:57.58]There's roof access.
[87:58.76]Okay.
[88:11.22]Running on a hangover, McCaffrey?
[88:13.10]Sit down and we'll talk!
[88:14.66]Did he think that was gonna work?
[88:15.82]I'm gonna throw a bird at you.
[88:21.91]Nice try.
[88:23.35]No, get down!
[88:23.89]Go back up.
[88:26.51]Alright, come here, Grover!
[88:30.93]Grover, McCaffrey, you are under arrest.
[88:40.24]He just got stuck there.
[88:41.42]Tackle.
[88:53.38]Tackle.
[88:54.91]Tackle him.
[88:58.03]Not yet.
[89:02.27]I mean, I think he knows where you're from at this point, Phelps.
[89:09.65]You're wearing a police outfit.
[89:11.31]You've said it three times.
[89:12.69]Here comes the tackle.
[89:14.75]Tackle.
[89:16.11]Tackle him.
[89:19.03]Tackle him.
[89:20.66]Tackle him!
[89:21.14]There it is.
[89:27.78]Can't we talk about this?
[89:29.76]What the fuck?
[90:05.44]That whole thing was kind of messed up.
[90:12.14]We need to get downtown and wrap this thing up.
[90:14.42]It's got to be McCaffrey.
[90:16.82]Unless Tiernan set him up.
[90:19.08]We talk about... You don't think that asshole Jameson could have done it, do you?
[90:25.08]His brain just shut up.
[90:28.60]His brain queued up that line.
[90:31.16]And it was already into his mouth through his vocal cords by the time he was knocked out.
[90:34.80]I'm gonna ride on this side.
[90:35.54]I ain't scared.
[90:56.46]Still didn't do it.
[90:57.90]I'm not scared.
[90:58.42]I'm not even gonna get off this either.
[91:12.43]Whoa, I passed it.
[91:18.19]I was too focused on driving on the tracks.
[91:29.50]I was hoping it was going to go into the cutscene.
[91:36.08]But it didn't.
[91:38.68]Excuse, excuses, excuses, excuse.
[91:40.64]Alright, we gotta line up.
[91:49.09]We have a couple of suspects.
[91:52.71]It's either McCaffrey or Tiernan, sir.
[91:54.99]Alright, let's go... Where do we go?
[91:58.21]Who do we go first?
[91:59.70]Oh no.
[91:59.88]Whatever one of this is.
[92:00.86]Two.
[92:21.23]Who's in interview 2?
[92:24.35]It's you, ready to answer some questions.
[92:26.65]You think I have all the answers?
[92:28.87]People who run from the police usually have something to hide.
[92:32.12]Touché, detective.
[92:35.06]Let's see where this takes us.
[92:40.68]Relationship with the victim.
[92:42.97]But wait a minute.
[92:44.76]I need to see some things here.
[92:46.12]Because we have pawned rings.
[92:47.62]Rings pawned by suspect Percy B. Shelley.
[92:50.37]Dark hair, medium height, and build.
[92:54.05]Show vagrant lifestyle.
[92:55.65]Missing ring added from marks on victim's skin.
[92:57.81]The ring was gone.
[93:00.33]Digest after midnight.
[93:01.39]Handbag.
[93:05.40]Movie lot employee ID found among victim's personal effects.
[93:11.22]This is the lipstick in possession of John Ferdinand Jameson.
[93:18.04]Torn letter addressed to Evelyn pieces found in possession of victim and McCaffrey.
[93:23.27]And this is the one... Okay, so this ties them together.
[93:29.73]Inscribed.
[93:30.69]This is the McCaffrey found amongst her personal things.
[93:33.67]This is his book.
[93:35.05]So, I don't know who she is.
[93:36.37]She'd never let me borrow a library book.
[93:38.35]Oh, yeah?
[93:38.69]I got it right here.
[93:42.34]Victim bought whiskey for a boy after an argument.
[93:46.96]And then there's a tie-iron.
[93:47.91]Okay.
[93:50.43]What is your relationship with the victim?
[93:52.37]You told us you barely knew Evelyn Summers.
[93:55.03]She hung around sometimes.
[93:57.85]I had very little to do with it.
[94:00.37]Well, that's not true.
[94:03.01]Now, the question is... Is it like the book?
[94:08.12]You lent her a book.
[94:12.08]That's very clearly your signature and you lent it to her.
[94:15.80]Or this letter.
[94:20.59]You'll have to do better than that, Grosvenor.
[94:22.37]We know about you and Evelyn.
[94:24.05]Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that.
[94:27.65]You can't link her to me.
[94:30.61]Alright, well... Which one is more damning, though?
[94:36.42]Did he write this?
[94:37.90]Who wrote this?
[94:42.81]I mean, the book is... It's clearly... It just has his signature in it.
[94:51.06]But, yeah, I mean, that's... We know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of the metaphysics.
[94:55.76]I what?
[94:57.44]I did no such thing.
[94:58.69]That bitch stole that book from my apartment.
[95:01.67]The impudent fucking moron.
[95:03.75]And that made you angry?
[95:05.01]Angry?
[95:05.31]I was livid.
[95:07.57]Looking up at me with that stupid face of hers, begging me to forgive her.
[95:14.70]Aha.
[95:16.46]Very good.
[95:18.58]That's one to you, detective.
[95:20.77]This guy's fucking crazy.
[95:25.61]What?
[95:25.91]Okay, alibi.
[95:29.49]What's your alibi?
[95:30.59]Evelyn died sometime around midnight.
[95:33.11]Remind me, where were you?
[95:35.58]I was at home.
[95:37.48]Writing.
[95:38.98]I'm working on a manuscript.
[95:45.30]Uh, or you know.
[95:47.62]You're going to need to do better if you don't want to swing for this.
[95:51.38]I was having a political meeting in my apartment.
[95:53.55]Cheese and crackers for the fifth columnist.
[95:56.37]Some of these people will corroborate your story.
[95:59.33]I won't give up names of party members.
[96:01.99]Good.
[96:02.37]It's your funeral.
[96:05.63]It's either going to be you or Tiernan Grobner.
[96:09.16]Make it stick, detective.
[96:11.48]The party has good lawyers.
[96:14.88]No, you've got me.
[96:15.68]You got me there.
[96:16.36]Touché.
[96:18.64]Well, let's go talk to the other guy.
[96:20.30]Alright, we need to interview room one.
[96:29.83]Which is this way.
[96:35.44]No guns.
[96:36.56]Wait, is this an interview room?
[96:39.20]No, this is the holding cell.
[96:44.84]Here's interview room one.
[96:49.12]Why did you run, Tiernan?
[96:52.30]I was the last one to see Evelyn that night.
[96:54.43]I knew you would think it was me.
[96:55.69]All right, this is the bowling alley guy.
[97:01.60]So, hold on.
[97:02.36]Relationship with the bowling alley guy.
[97:06.55]Handbag, movie lot, liquor purchase.
[97:13.82]So liquor purchase.
[97:15.58]Store owner Robbins testifies victim bought whiskey for a boy after an argument, right?
[97:20.72]So he's going to, this is the boy, right?
[97:23.86]Can you describe your relationship with Evelyn?
[97:27.36]I barely knew Evelyn.
[97:38.33]Sounds like half an answer to me, Tiernan.
[97:40.43]Were you sleeping with her?
[97:42.93]That's none of your business.
[97:46.13]Fuck.
[97:47.57]But... Aristotle's Metaphysics.
[97:53.31]The book that belonged to McCaffrey.
[97:55.51]McCaffrey saw her looking at her once and laughed in her face.
[97:58.29]What's in his front pocket?
[97:59.17]Cigarettes?
[97:59.39]And you're saying Evelyn stole it.
[98:01.98]She wanted something of his.
[98:08.79]Truth?
[98:09.09]I mean, he's staring directly.
[98:15.29]That's truth.
[98:18.99]Look at his eyes.
[98:20.20]He is locked in.
[98:24.46]You don't like McCaffrey, do you, Tiernan?
[98:28.20]He's full of the common man routine, but he props up a bar like the rest of us.
[98:32.92]Evelyn thought he was going to be a great novelist.
[98:36.92]He had nothing but vitriol for her.
[98:40.05]Holy shit, that's wrong.
[98:41.61]Okay, so this guy... He wasn't darting.
[98:44.91]Okay, alibi for... You and Evelyn were drinking together last night, and she had no other place to stay.
[98:51.22]I don't know what happened last night.
[98:54.30]I don't remember.
[98:54.92]Well, we got him here, because this is the... Yeah, I'm sorry, dude.
[99:00.46]You're lying, Tierney.
[99:01.32]She bought you booze, and you know it.
[99:04.55]I'm not lying!
[99:05.55]She got up and left!
[99:06.37]That was it!
[99:11.13]Well, sorry, but the facts stay the other way.
[99:16.07]She left, but she came back.
[99:17.96]She bought you a quart of whiskey to make it up to you.
[99:20.26]She told the liquor store owner, you're in deep trouble, buddy.
[99:24.52]She said she loved me.
[99:27.40]She wanted to care for me.
[99:28.28]Uh-oh.
[99:30.18]Confession.
[99:30.55]She never stopped talking about McCaffrey.
[99:32.25]Confession.
[99:33.71]McCaffrey was a writer, McCaffrey was a hero, McCaffrey cared for the little guy.
[99:38.25]Did you kill her, Tiernan?
[99:39.41]Confession.
[99:40.54]Might as well have.
[99:41.36]Confession.
[99:43.00]Kicked her out.
[99:44.16]I kicked her.
[99:44.76]She had nowhere to go.
[99:45.80]In her mouth.
[99:47.04]Okay, well.
[99:51.86]Do you own a car, Tiernan?
[99:53.77]No, I don't.
[99:56.99]Have access to a lug wrench?
[99:59.13]We use a lot of them.
[100:00.43]To clear jams in the pin setting machines.
[100:05.64]Okay, he's lying.
[100:06.54]But, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[100:16.55]But that's not... I don't think I can connect it.
[100:22.81]Coroner's report says that Evelyn was killed with a wrench.
[100:26.15]I think you did it and then planted the evidence at McCaffrey's apartment for us to find.
[100:31.11]We went to his apartment.
[100:33.11]McCaffrey was up on the roof.
[100:35.29]Evelyn stole the book.
[100:37.83]McCaffrey went crazy when he found out.
[100:39.61]He said he would put her out of her misery.
[100:42.53]He can be very cruel.
[100:45.28]Alan was missing a ring from her right hand.
[100:47.34]That's strange.
[100:49.34]She always wore it.
[100:51.42]A big black circular disc with a white E in the middle.
[100:56.72]It was made from an old typewriter key, present from the prop department at her old movie studio.
[101:00.52]50%.
[101:00.70]We're going to talk to McCaffrey.
[101:04.15]You need to think about what you've told us, Tiernan.
[101:06.17]You're not in the clear.
[101:09.33]Okay, so... Let's see.
[101:18.94]I got this Gadget Whiz guy putting recording devices in his place.
[101:22.96]So I have to go to the other room.
[101:26.08]Sit down.
[101:26.92]Hey, so did you do it?
[101:30.36]I want to ask you another question.
[101:34.04]Access to the tire iron.
[101:37.06]We found the lug wrench that Evelyn was battered with in your apartment, and the note from her mother, and your blood-stained clothing.
[101:44.04]We have you cold, McCaffrey.
[101:46.56]You think if I could be bothered to murder Evelyn Summers, I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment?
[102:00.17]Tiernan testifies to threats of violence against a victim made by McCaffrey.
[102:06.19]So, we got you.
[102:09.59]I don't believe you, Grosvenor.
[102:11.07]The evidence says that you killed her.
[102:14.05]You can prove that I wanted to kill Evelyn,
[102:22.08]Tiernan is prepared to testify that you threatened Evelyn's life in his presence.
[102:27.07]Self-preservation.
[102:28.73]That's understandable.
[102:31.81]Okay, I'll level with you.
[102:33.55]This guy's so weird.
[102:34.61]Tiernan killed Evelyn.
[102:36.42]He came to me for help.
[102:38.00]I listened to him, and he explained why he did it.
[102:40.90]Tiernan went to you for help.
[102:42.34]I expect me to buy that.
[102:43.62]Back in there.
[102:44.12]That's how it went down.
[102:45.22]Back and forth.
[102:46.21]I told him he made a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away if he went to the cops.
[102:50.53]I took his things and told him I would dispose of them.
[102:53.67]But you didn't.
[102:55.31]Speak to Tiernan.
[102:57.35]Oh, God.
[102:59.71]Okay, so now we gotta go back in there and say, hey, he says you did it.
[103:04.51]Well, he did it.
[103:05.24]Well, he says you did it.
[103:06.28]Well, I say he did it.
[103:08.90]Jesus.
[103:09.20]Jesus.
[103:10.42]Okay.
[103:15.76]Oops.
[103:17.08]Wrong way.
[103:24.52]Where's the other interview room?
[103:30.53]It's over here, right?
[103:36.57]No!
[103:37.07]No!
[103:37.59]God!
[103:42.06]I hate the camera spin, third person angle that they stuff in these small corridors.
[103:56.33]Okay, so.
[104:00.81]Rawlings bowling alley employee and friend, yeah.
[104:03.19]Okay, wait a minute, so let me see.
[104:05.23]Here's this accusation.
[104:08.07]Gaffer testifies to Tiernan confessing and asking for help disposing of evidence.
[104:17.25]So Evelyn passed out, and you walked out.
[104:19.79]What happened next?
[104:22.79]I woke up in the morning.
[104:25.00]Mary hungover.
[104:28.60]I thought Evelyn would have come back.
[104:32.86]OK.
[104:35.26]Well.
[104:37.10]I know you're lying, James.
[104:38.38]You went out looking for her.
[104:40.20]Tell me what really happened.
[104:43.31]I don't know what you're talking about.
[104:46.43]How can you say I wasn't in that hotel room?
[104:49.55]This is a dub.
[104:52.99]Can't we just hook something up to your brain and see what your thoughts are?
[104:57.07]You wound up at McCaffrey's.
[104:58.25]You were still incredibly drunk.
[104:59.63]You passed out on his floor.
[105:01.15]It's time to tell me what really happened.
[105:07.49]McCaffrey woke me up in the next morning.
[105:11.27]Wait a minute.
[105:11.77]Is this for real?
[105:14.07]He showed me the lug wrench and the letter and the box.
[105:19.23]And he said I came in with him last night.
[105:27.73]He said that I killed Evelyn.
[105:29.60]But what if he didn't, though?
[105:31.10]Did you?
[105:31.44]And then it was all over the radio.
[105:32.62]And that he would protect me.
[105:39.37]I don't know.
[105:39.73]I don't know.
[105:40.19]There's not enough evidence.
[105:40.99]Ugh.
[106:07.53]So, the scenario is... Other guy... Tiernan... Tiernan tells... Hey, I found all this stuff in your apartment and you killed this girl.
[106:18.24]And he doesn't remember anything from the night before.
[106:21.66]But what's... That's too fishy for me.
[106:26.06]It's weird.
[106:34.96]He was...
[106:38.87]Wait here.
[106:41.96]Is there any... I don't know.
[106:53.82]If you're... I'm the other guy, I think.
[107:00.95]Let me, like, talk to this guy one more time.
[107:02.25]I think we bust in there and find the goddamn evidence.
[107:07.11]Can I talk to you for a second?
[107:09.05]Railroad someone else.
[107:11.07]I'm not saying anything.
[107:20.44]Uh-oh.
[107:21.10]I can't talk to this guy?
[107:24.04]Phone, phone, phone, phone, phone.
[107:26.02]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[107:28.76]Yes, there's a phone here.
[107:32.12]Operator, give me dispatch.
[107:37.03]Putting you through now.
[107:40.29]Cole Phelps, Batch 1247.
[107:45.25]How could I help, Detective?
[107:47.67]I need the jacket on a Grosvenor McCaffrey.
[107:51.17]Just a moment, Detective.
[107:53.59]McCaffrey was formerly under surveillance by the Red Squad.
[107:59.17]Convictions for petty theft.
[107:59.85]Dishonorable discharge from the Army during training at Syracuse.
[108:02.07]Oh, God.
[108:03.29]All right, well.
[108:05.37]He did it.
[108:06.09]Thanks.
[108:09.50]Need a drink.
[108:10.02]I got the jitters again.
[108:14.51]Way to make it real easy for me.
[108:27.85]James Tiernan, I'm charging you with the murder of... Oh, wrong guy!
[108:31.54]I believe you didn't know what you were doing.
[108:33.36]Oh, my head.
[108:34.46]Oh, I have an instant headache.
[108:35.24]That's the best I can do.
[108:44.48]Load it.
[108:44.84]How do I load that scene?
[108:49.32]I need to reload the cutscene.
[108:51.56]Oh, he didn't do it.
[108:52.50]I knew it.
[108:53.40]I went the wrong room.
[108:54.94]Whoa, my blood pressure just went up to like 100.
[109:00.52]How do I restart that?
[109:03.28]That's not the guy I wanted.
[109:04.16]I'm going to assume that you both have very good excuses for what happened to my station today.
[109:09.40]You had a perfectly good candidate for a capital case.
[109:12.26]And some- But quits- quits- that's- but where's it gonna put me though, man?
[109:18.34]Where's it gonna put me?
[109:18.94]Where's it gonna put me?
[109:26.35]Is it gonna be alright?
[109:27.03]I- you guys all know that's not what I wanted to do.
[109:35.97]I just like pressed the- I was in the wrong place to press the wrong button.
[109:41.07]You know, I solved the mystery.
[109:42.57]Oh, I just gave myself a fucking migraine.
[109:47.19]I just got electrocuted up here.
[110:01.58]Pretending for... No.
[110:03.44]I swear to God.
[110:04.56]I just... I mixed up the names.
[110:15.67]She was 13 if she was a day.
[110:18.94]Okay, so we're just gonna do this again.
[110:21.42]We knew what I was gonna do.
[110:23.82]We just gotta skip.
[110:24.88]You ready to answer some questions?
[110:26.78]You think I have all the answers?
[110:28.00]I don't even remember the things I did.
[110:29.06]People who run from the police usually have something to hide.
[110:31.36]Touché, detective.
[110:34.71]Okay, so.
[110:35.77]Let's see where this takes us.
[110:37.63]It was the book, right?
[110:40.43]You told us you barely knew Evelyn Summers.
[110:43.31]She hung around sometimes.
[110:46.13]I had very little to do with her.
[110:50.35]Okay, so this is the book.
[110:52.83]You'll have to do better than that, Grosvenor.
[110:54.61]We know about you and Evelyn.
[110:56.29]Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that.
[110:59.90]You can't link her to me.
[111:04.32]Oh, thank God.
[111:05.40]I just gave myself a fucking migraine.
[111:08.14]We know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of The Metaphysics.
[111:11.48]I what?
[111:13.16]I did no such thing.
[111:14.40]That bitch stole that book from my apartment.
[111:17.36]The impudent fucking moron.
[111:19.50]And that made you angry?
[111:20.76]Angry?
[111:21.04]I was livid.
[111:23.30]Drinking more water?
[111:25.30]I haven't been drinking water.
[111:29.47]God damn it.
[111:30.47]Aha.
[111:32.23]Very good.
[111:34.33]That's one to you, detective.
[111:40.27]Evelyn died sometime around midnight.
[111:42.78]Remind me, where were you?
[111:45.26]I was at home, writing.
[111:48.67]I'm working on a manuscript.
[111:52.15]Okay, that was a lie.
[111:55.37]You're going to need to do better if you don't want to swing for this.
[111:59.13]I was having a political meeting in my apartment.
[112:01.67]Cheese and crackers for the fifth columnist.
[112:04.09]Some of these people will corroborate your story.
[112:07.05]I won't give up names of party members.
[112:08.99]Same mistake.
[112:09.83]Good.
[112:10.38]I'm not going to pretend I... I'm not going to... It's either going to be you or Tiernan and Grosvenor.
[112:16.30]You want to go back and make... I'm a stick detective.
[112:18.76]I did it wrong.
[112:19.34]The party has good lawyers.
[112:22.06]You want me to go back?
[112:22.74]I just need to correct the mistake that I made.
[112:25.04]I don't care about the in-between.
[112:27.20]You want me to go cheese and get a perfect score?
[112:29.64]No, that's not fair.
[112:33.12]Alright, telephone.
[112:36.86]Apparently not.
[112:39.95]Telephone isn't here yet.
[112:43.75]No, I didn't cheese.
[112:44.99]I made a mistake.
[112:46.21]And I pressed the wrong button.
[112:52.85]I swear to fucking God.
[112:56.60]Get out of the goddamn way.
[113:00.14]Why did you run, Tiernan?
[113:03.32]I was the last one to see Evelyn that night.
[113:05.10]I knew you would think it was me.
[113:08.56]Can you describe your relationship with Evelyn?
[113:10.74]Same mistakes.
[113:12.06]It's gotta be authentic.
[113:13.80]I barely knew her.
[113:14.54]Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
[113:18.54]Sounds like half an answer to me, Tiernan.
[113:20.64]Were you sleeping with her?
[113:23.15]That's none of your business.
[113:25.19]Yep, yep, yep, we got that one wrong.
[113:26.47]I remember.
[113:27.49]Aristotle's Metaphysics, the book that belonged to McCaffrey.
[113:31.23]McCaffrey saw her looking at her once and laughed in her face.
[113:33.98]I'm going to do the same things I did before.
[113:35.26]You're saying Evelyn stole it.
[113:37.70]We're not cheesing a 100%.
[113:39.88]I'm doing the same answers.
[113:43.82]We either hang this on you or McCaffrey.
[113:46.02]You better give us something.
[113:49.27]McCaffrey's been in trouble with the law before.
[113:51.33]I mean, he always makes out with some kind of labor dispute, but I'm not so sure.
[113:57.26]Lame streamer.
[113:58.22]How dare you?
[113:58.64]How dare you?
[113:59.90]You and Evelyn were drinking together last night, and she had no other place to stay.
[114:04.30]I don't know what happened last night.
[114:07.38]I don't remember.
[114:08.82]Liquor purchase, I've got you.
[114:10.69]You're lying, Tiernan.
[114:12.11]You've been fighting with her.
[114:13.63]You fought, and... I'm not lying!
[114:15.83]She got up and left!
[114:16.65]That was
[114:17.48]Trailer moment, by the way.
[114:18.56]That was in the trailer.
[114:23.34]She left, but she came back.
[114:25.22]She bought you a quart of whiskey to make it up to you.
[114:27.53]She told the liquor store owner, you're in deep trouble, buddy.
[114:31.81]She said she loved me.
[114:34.69]She wanted to care for me.
[114:37.66]She would never stop talking about McCaffrey.
[114:40.96]McCaffrey was a writer.
[114:42.13]McCaffrey was a hero.
[114:43.41]McCaffrey cared for the little guy.
[114:45.55]Did you kill her, Tiernan?
[114:47.83]Might as well have.
[114:48.37]I just keep flashing back to my brain.
[114:50.39]Kicked her out.
[114:52.07]She had nowhere to go.
[114:54.47]Access to the murder weapon.
[114:56.37]Yeah, right.
[114:56.95]Do you own a car, Tiernan?
[114:58.25]Yeah, right.
[115:01.62]Have access to a lug wrench?
[115:03.78]We use a lot of them to clear jams in the pin setting machines.
[115:09.49]Coroner's report says that Evelyn was killed with a wrench.
[115:12.83]I think you did it and then planted the evidence at McCaffrey's apartment for us to find.
[115:17.79]We went to his apartment.
[115:19.80]McCaffrey was up on the roof.
[115:21.96]Evelyn stole the book.
[115:24.52]McCaffrey went crazy when he found out.
[115:26.30]He said he would put her out of her misery.
[115:29.23]He can be very cruel.
[115:31.66]Mm-hmm.
[115:41.66]E e e e e e e.
[116:05.54]That's all I hear.
[116:06.14]That's all I can hear right now.
[116:09.46]Alright, let's go accuse the KF Reapers.
[116:17.57]We've got an accusation, and you did it!
[116:21.73]Wait!
[116:25.07]Do I have to do this first?
[116:30.27]Why is he telling me what to do?
[116:33.07]I can't get up.
[116:35.42]I can't get up.
[116:38.38]Why is he commanding me to stay?
[116:48.38]We found the lug wrench that Evelyn was battered with in your apartment and the note from her mother and your blood-stained clothing.
[116:55.38]We have you cold, McCaffrey.
[116:57.88]You think if I could be bothered to murder Evelyn Summers, I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment?
[117:07.21]I don't believe you, Grosvenor.
[117:08.69]The evidence says that you killed her.
[117:11.67]You can prove that I wanted to kill Evelyn?
[117:15.73]Yes.
[117:19.33]Tiernan is prepared to testify that you threatened Evelyn's life in his presence.
[117:24.46]Banjo-Kazooie.
[117:25.10]Oh, yeah.
[117:29.05]Okay, I'll level with you.
[117:31.79]Tiernan killed Evelyn.
[117:33.67]He came to me for help.
[117:35.25]I listened to him, and he explained why he did it.
[117:38.16]Tiernan went to you for help.
[117:39.80]You expect me to buy that?
[117:41.16]Wow.
[117:41.48]That's how it went down.
[117:42.50]That's how it went down.
[117:43.46]I told him he made a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away if he went to the cops.
[117:47.62]I took his things and told him I would dispose of them.
[117:50.60]Sometimes.
[117:51.02]I mean, it depends if there's a certain scenario.
[117:52.70]Speak to Tiernan.
[117:54.58]He'll give it up.
[117:56.30]Okay, thank you.
[118:01.47]Telephone call for Mr. Phelps.
[118:03.75]We've got some information.
[118:09.31]Operator, give me R&I.
[118:12.97]Putting you through now.
[118:16.65]Phelps, 1247.
[118:17.18]Tattoo.
[118:17.56]How can I help, Detective?
[118:23.88]I need the jacket on a Grosvenor McCaffrey.
[118:27.62]Just a moment, Detective.
[118:29.00]Different voice.
[118:32.35]Thank you.
[118:33.01]Okay, uh, so... Is that all we need?
[118:36.53]What happened here?
[119:04.45]Do I have to do the other guy first?
[119:05.75]The thing was, he was a really nice guy.
[119:09.33]I felt lousy collaring him.
[119:11.47]Who?
[119:11.75]What?
[119:14.75]You were in the war?
[119:16.33]Yes, I was.
[119:18.37]Seeing the things that I saw.
[119:21.25]It changes a man.
[119:23.55]I came back here determined to change things.
[119:26.75]All I wanted was a pen and an opportunity to speak out.
[119:31.40]You told us before that you had only minor run-ins with the police.
[119:35.57]You didn't mention petty theft.
[119:37.03]I've never been in trouble for violence.
[119:38.53]That's the salient point here, isn't it?
[119:43.41]You're lying, McCaffrey.
[119:45.01]You have a history of violence towards women.
[119:47.95]How do you turn a couple parking tickets and a petty theft misdemeanor into an assault charge?
[119:54.78]Because we've got it.
[119:59.48]I almost just clicked this.
[120:04.98]I would have been very upset.
[120:06.87]I would have been very upset.
[120:09.84]We know all about you and your dishonorable discharge, beating some poor woman near to death in Syracuse.
[120:16.53]You've never been in combat, McCaffrey.
[120:18.57]Your whole life is a fraud.
[120:20.49]She was a goddamn peasant whore.
[120:22.81]She tried to steal from my wallet.
[120:24.25]I could have fought for this country.
[120:26.01]I could have... You beat her because she stole from you, because she tried to outsmart you.
[120:30.76]The ignorant audacity of the bitch.
[120:33.42]What is a man supposed to do?
[120:35.46]Sit there and take it?
[120:37.56]How is a man supposed to call himself a man?
[120:39.98]And Evelyn Summers, a poor, drunken nobody, stole your book.
[120:44.25]And she got what was coming to her.
[120:47.55]Oh, well, I'll see you in the slammer.
[120:51.95]Governor McCaffrey, I'm charging you with the murder of Evelyn Summers.
[120:54.98]That's what was supposed to happen.
[120:56.00]She was a sad lady who never hurt anyone except herself.
[120:59.70]I hope God finds a way to forgive you.
[121:04.98]wrong guy congratulations boys you bagged the fine catch another red to boot go back do it again he didn't do it I want you to put this business about a repeat offender out of your mind this mcafree creature shows no remorse and neither will the grand jury you would have to walk a long mile to find a better candidate for an unmarked plot at a prison graveyard thanks dad
[121:41.13]Alright, so, uh, I am going to find out first.
[121:45.05]That's not bad.
[121:46.47]Only, uh, it's too much damage.
[121:50.76]No injuries, though.
[121:57.62]Alright, so, I'm going to, uh, get a drink.
[122:01.72]After we get a point to stop him.
[122:07.49]We have lost most of Shaughnessy and Dunn's squad.
[122:09.49]The gunny is dead.
[122:10.19]First platoon is in worse shape.
[122:11.35]That medic is still crazy.
[122:12.51]The bravest man alive.
[122:13.41]That way, Rowley, with the first.
[122:14.47]They're trying for the naboots.
[122:15.73]It's here to the left.
[122:16.69]To the right, it goes right through a pass with two naboots and Inflate.
[122:19.49]Mate!
[122:19.87]I might need a banana.
[122:20.89]Can I get a banana?
[122:25.06]And we just saved your ass by boarding the river my orders are to reconnoiter I Think that point is now moved.
[122:30.02]You have 10 men left.
[122:30.50]My orders are to save what's left move out
[122:55.23]We keep getting those flashbacks.
[123:02.34]Quarter moon murders.
[123:05.90]Coming up next.
[123:12.42]Well done, lads.
[123:13.32]You did well with the Summers case.
[123:15.46]But we have a problem.
[123:16.38]The examiner received a new letter today.
[123:18.64]Do you mind if I take a look, Ray?
[123:22.26]Uh... Come find me where I hid myself.
[123:24.62]Okay.
[123:55.41]looking another snippet from the shelly looking in wonder up to heaven while yet the music peeled along I hit myself within a fountain in the public square right lay like the reflex of the moon seen in a wave under green leaves waste of paper man you could have added a little bit more couple more paragraphs all right uh let me just percy
[124:22.42]The poetic works of Percy Beechy Shelley.
[124:25.52]To suffer woes which hope thinks infinite.
[124:32.27]To forgive wrongs darker than death or night.
[124:36.73]To defy power which seems omnipotent.
[124:39.97]To love and bear, to hope till hope creates.
[124:43.70]From now until my final watch.
[124:48.15]Because it's time to start the Night's Watch.
[124:50.87]I don't remember it.
[124:52.33]I don't know how it goes.
[124:53.23]I'll be back.
[124:53.55]I'll see you in a minute.
[124:54.25]I'm gonna make a smoothie.
[124:54.93]Hang on a moment, Skipper.
[124:56.01]Let me finish, Rusty!
[125:10.44]We have five birds in hand and half in the bush.
[125:13.72]The department will not survive a scandal if we have to let them all go without catching a fiend first.
[125:18.48]Your careers will be over for a start, gentlemen.
[125:23.07]Looking in wonder... Ah, fuck it!
[125:25.57]I knew this technical support would be true.
[125:27.93]I hid myself within a fountain in the public square.
[125:31.79]You like that stuff?
[125:33.97]What is it supposed to mean?
[125:35.81]Forget what it's supposed to mean.
[125:36.85]What does he want?
[125:37.79]Where are you going with this, Cole?
[125:39.11]He's obviously taunting us.
[125:40.77]He believes he's far more intelligent than we are.
[125:42.84]Okay.
[125:43.28]It's some kind of story, right?
[125:45.12]A guy that God hates chains him up.
[125:47.16]It's an allegory, Rusty.
[125:48.82]A story with two meanings.
[125:50.98]Which one of the guys in the room is the guy planting all this doing this?
[125:54.06]Are you using it literally?
[125:55.18]Within a fountain in a public square?
[125:56.63]Could it be somebody in the room?
[125:57.39]Could it be that easy?
[125:58.45]Did somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?
[126:01.23]The fountain in Pershing Square.
[126:04.19]What if this is me?
[126:07.11]What if it was just me?
[126:10.59]It's my game.
[126:11.15]It's gonna be him.
[126:12.68]Right?
[126:12.92]Alright.
[126:15.56]I'll see you guys in T-minus two minutes.
[126:19.38]I'm gonna make a smoothie.
[126:20.38]Be right back.
[126:44.46]What are we waiting for?
[127:55.98]Hey, Cole, let's get moving.
[127:58.20]Yeah, I'm thinking of moving up to a 45.
[128:03.41]I want to put him down to one round.
[128:55.74]What are we waiting for?
[129:50.86]Need a drink.
[129:52.00]I got the jitters again.
[129:55.91]Hey Cole, let's get moving.
[130:39.42]What are we waiting for?
[131:23.01]What's going on?
[131:26.53]By the way, I made this a little too thick.
[131:31.41]It's kind of like drinking paint.
[131:37.38]What are you waiting for?
[131:38.26]What is going on?
[131:38.84]What the hell are you doing?
[131:55.78]Hey, Cole!
[131:57.38]Get moving!
[131:59.70]What do you mean, what do we... Was he just talking the whole time?
[132:05.38]That's fine.
[132:13.72]What the hell are we doing?
[132:14.94]It's getting harder to pay attention.
[132:20.03]City Park.
[132:20.51]Okay, it's the current destination.
[132:21.69]I was so on the ball last night.
[132:24.88]Now I'm thinking about fast food and bananas and paint.
[132:29.36]I'm lost.
[132:34.94]This seriously has the same consistency as paint, though.
[132:38.11]This is like drinking paint.
[132:39.25]Oh, Jerma, how do you know what paint tastes like?
[132:41.17]Because I drank it.
[132:41.99]A lot.
[132:42.29]7855, code 6.
[132:52.15]Okay.
[132:52.33]That was beautiful, by the way.
[132:53.69]By the way.
[132:54.23]By the way.
[132:54.89]By the way.
[132:55.25]You know what I love?
[132:56.59]I love, you know, by the way.
[133:20.24]I love how... I love how... X. I love how... I love... Hey, by the way... It's like how 60% of every sentence I say when I stream starts with... I love how... By the way... Watch where you're driving, you...
[133:56.55]What happened?
[134:01.47]Rather you than me, Phelps.
[134:06.51]Where's the crime scene?
[134:13.14]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:13.88]That's right.
[134:14.18]That's right.
[134:14.60]That's right.
[134:15.36]In the fountain we shall shine.
[134:16.94]When it's time to dine.
[134:19.06]My social security number.
[134:25.79]is there for you to find.
[134:26.97]Elizabeth Short.
[134:28.92]Oh shit, that's mine.
[134:30.00]Whoa, what?
[134:32.59]By the way, I love how that would be my number if it was potential.
[134:46.80]That was potential.
[134:49.00]Use your words and make it count, Jeremy.
[134:50.50]There's a cave all overgrown with trailing odorous plants which curtain out the day.
[134:57.36]Where next?
[135:01.89]Elizabeth Short's social security card.
[135:04.03]Jesus Christ!
[135:06.03]Jeremy, 985 is short.
[135:07.35]Here's his social security card.
[135:08.69]I already told the joke that you guys are writing, so please.
[135:14.67]You got a city map?
[135:16.79]See if he can work out where he's taking us.
[135:19.13]See, if I do it, you can't.
[135:20.07]How is this freak leading us around by the nose?
[135:23.93]It's the big landmarks.
[135:32.46]What the fuck is it trying to tell me to do?
[135:46.63]Hidden vehicle.
[135:57.36]This is a huge map.
[136:10.92]Go get the hidden car.
[136:14.47]We're in the middle of a mission.
[136:22.33]uh hold on a minute let me making square decide for the second excerpt what was the can I look at the excerpt again please right
[136:43.55]There's a cave all overgrown with trailing odorous plants, which curtain out the day with leaves and flowers, and paved with veined emerald in a fountain, leaps in the midst with an awakening sound.
[136:54.77]From its curved roof, the mountain's frozen tears, like snow or silver or long diamond spires, hang downward, raining.
[137:01.22]I don't know what this is.
[137:15.45]Where the fuck am I supposed to find this?
[137:18.87]Is it another fountain?
[137:19.79]I need to go find another fountain.
[137:24.25]The cave.
[137:42.56]There's a treasure in the caves.
[138:10.71]The station could be a cave.
[138:28.82]Cave!
[138:34.06]Bingo.
[138:39.49]Why are we running there?
[138:53.41]I should take a car.
[138:55.61]I'm so proud of myself.
[138:58.00]I forgot the car.
[138:59.48]Out of the car!
[139:00.24]Police!
[139:00.66]Wait, officer!
[139:01.22]My bag's in there!
[139:08.23]Wait, hold on, I gotta wait for Harold.
[139:10.87]Come on, Harold!
[139:13.29]Him.
[139:19.62]It's really him, the fuck who killed the Dahlia.
[139:21.62]Can you believe this?
[139:24.22]He's leading us.
[139:25.87]It's his game, Rusty.
[139:27.71]You may want someone to catch him, but he's extremely dangerous.
[139:31.40]I doubt if he will give up easily.
[139:33.06]It's me.
[139:33.44]It's me.
[139:33.76]It's me.
[139:34.16]We clip this fuck and we get citation.
[139:39.08]What a day to be a cop.
[139:41.34]Have you guys seen Phelps without his hat on?
[139:45.79]I haven't.
[139:46.15]There are going to be fucking horns under there.
[139:50.31]Come on.
[140:06.86]This is what you get for not fucking getting out of the way.
[140:18.05]Alright, well, you're very good at this, so I'll let you live.
[140:25.60]Alright, we're looking for the... Thank god.
[140:41.27]All right, everybody be quiet for this part.
[140:47.55]I want total concentration.
[140:49.11]No text.
[141:06.66]Can I help you, sir?
[141:09.64]Scale the chandelier?
[141:11.06]This is very important, sir.
[141:12.60]How do we get to the top of the chandelier?
[141:14.30]You what?
[141:14.94]Have a little faith, pal.
[141:16.56]We're in a real hurry.
[141:17.50]Head up to the top floor.
[141:18.98]There's an access panel and a ladder in the maintenance room.
[141:28.35]My concentration, I don't know, somehow is breaking here.
[141:30.85]I thought I asked for complete silence, no talk, no text, nothing in the chat.
[141:46.82]Can you guys do it?
[141:49.90]I wonder if there could be no messages.
[141:55.29]Let's do an experiment here.
[141:56.39]Can there be no messages in this chat for like one straight minute?
[142:02.73]Twitch plays don't talk.
[142:04.53]There's no way.
[142:20.42]This is absolutely no way.
[142:25.69]It's impossible.
[142:27.49]Coffee room.
[142:29.49]Fire department.
[142:34.03]No, see, emote-only mode doesn't help because emote-only mode is just screaming.
[142:42.78]Electrical.
[142:45.16]Private.
[142:46.81]Every time I see an emote, I imagine that emote yelling its name like Pokemon.
[142:53.34]Police department records.
[143:01.84]Got it.
[143:03.56]Oh, hey.
[143:04.13]Let's go.
[143:18.51]Oh, come on, really?
[143:22.17]I thought I could just keep swinging back and forth.
[144:03.41]You found my clue.
[144:04.43]Good for you.
[144:07.13]Now it's up to you.
[144:10.80]Upon my mouth, I do chew.
[144:14.70]What am I?
[144:21.60]Oh, and a stew.
[144:22.70]What is this?
[144:23.12]It's just a watch.
[144:34.65]From the temples high of man's ear and eye.
[144:37.19]From the temples high of man's ear and eye, roofed over sculptures and posy.
[144:41.03]Where have I seen that?
[144:42.07]From the moorings of the Dunshield Springs where science produces dead air wings.
[144:50.21]Oh, look out!
[144:52.30]Mario!
[144:52.98]Get off that goddamn thing!
[144:54.16]Hit the chain, Mario!
[144:55.46]Find a rope, Rusty!
[144:56.30]There is a time.
[144:58.38]If you can swing that thing from side to side, get it over the edge, then jump for it.
[145:05.01]I'm not really going to do that.
[145:07.17]Swing it!
[145:09.59]Uh, swing the chandelier.
[145:11.83]Oh, come on!
[145:12.69]I've only got a few more teeth on this chandelier.
[145:17.22]It's gonna go in a second.
[145:18.84]Swing that goddamn thing and jump for it.
[145:26.93]One!
[145:44.63]Two!
[145:44.85]Three!
[145:45.31]Whoa!
[145:45.69]Well, that's $200,000 in city damages.
[145:47.27]That's not going to be on the bill at the end of the level, right?
[145:49.29]The higher you climb, the further you fall.
[145:51.45]Let's get out of here.
[145:53.59]Another Dahlia clue?
[145:55.54]No.
[145:56.40]A yellow-gold wristwatch.
[145:58.50]A molar dame.
[145:59.60]Yes.
[146:00.40]And a scrap of the poem.
[146:02.42]Another location.
[146:03.22]If I can work it out.
[146:04.04]All right.
[146:11.32]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[146:14.06]From the temple's high of man's ear and eye, roofed over sculpture and posy.
[146:24.64]the mermings of unsealed springs with science bedews his detail wings man's ear and eye temple high no a station could be in here an ear canal
[147:11.47]No, I was just there.
[147:13.79]The RKO Theater.
[147:22.16]That's it, huh?
[147:39.55]Hmm.
[147:54.93]From the temples high of man's ear and eye.
[147:59.75]Roofed over sculpture and posy.
[148:03.64]Looking for a temple?
[148:10.40]The most monogamous interior.
[148:12.24]We don't give a shit about interior.
[148:15.55]World's shortest railroad.
[148:24.33]Temple!
[148:33.31]KTI radio reminds you an ounce of prevention saves many an emergency.
[148:39.46]Jesus, Phelps!
[148:40.28]Your home has a first aid kit for safety.
[148:44.50]Just looking for the word.
[148:45.70]One word.
[148:47.70]This guy needs to be taken out of circulation.
[148:51.24]He takes pleasure in stringing us along.
[148:53.56]Demonstrating how much smarter he is.
[148:55.30]Why am I not interacting?
[148:57.22]If we survive this, it's going to be a miracle.
[148:59.98]I'm trying to decipher clues.
[149:03.56]Why are you guys counting?
[149:07.00]Didn't I snap counting his neck like six months ago?
[149:19.21]Watch it, will ya?
[149:22.29]Maybe I drive better if you shut the hell up.
[149:29.36]On a solid kick.
[149:30.88]Always looking ready, man.
[149:33.55]I'm on another side.
[149:35.99]I'm a shark.
[150:04.11]Jesus, Phelps!
[150:04.83]You're terrorizing these poor slobs!
[150:07.22]You okay?
[150:14.93]His name is Phelps.
[150:15.69]It's always... I've read about him.
[150:17.55]Yeah, I just read his license plate as it drove into my face.
[150:22.07]It's now permanently imprinted into my forehead.
[150:48.60]Climb the library tower.
[150:49.30]I'm pulling rank here, Cole.
[150:50.07]I'm not hauling myself up there.
[150:53.23]Go get him, Tiger.
[150:55.91]You'd slow me down anyway, old timer.
[151:00.55]Don't even have... Oh, another pigeon.
[151:05.37]Another pigeon NPC.
[151:11.51]It's gonna be the lady from Home Alone 2.
[151:55.71]Horns, there they are.
[151:58.15]Demon horns.
[152:06.66]A plus commentary.
[152:08.08]What do you want me to say?
[152:10.90]Climbing up here.
[152:11.60]Okay.
[152:11.78]What do we got here?
[152:15.65]Looks like another scaffolding, another ladder.
[152:17.27]Let's make climbing up this ladder.
[152:19.83]All right, here we go.
[152:20.67]Climbing up the ladder.
[152:22.84]What's next?
[152:23.38]A jump?
[152:23.78]Let me just jump this.
[152:25.02]Okay, I jumped it.
[152:26.92]And let's jump this one.
[152:28.58]Two jumps.
[152:32.88]Stop talking.
[152:33.77]You see?
[152:45.91]Smartass.
[152:50.01]Alright, this is what I get for reading.
[153:02.60]Sometimes a step backwards is a step in the right direction.
[153:09.50]That's what I'm trying to do.
[153:11.81]Why are you not interacting?
[153:13.11]Alright, alright, that's it.
[153:17.39]That's it.
[153:18.79]Alright, that's it.
[153:20.11]Ooh, that was... What?
[153:23.36]I'm alive, okay.
[153:24.14]Okay.
[153:33.05]He's supposed to go up there.
[153:34.45]Thank you very much.
[153:35.71]Yeah, that would hurt.
[153:42.07]He rolled on his neck.
[153:43.13]I have to go all the way to the top?
[153:54.60]It's a locket and a letter.
[153:56.42]Here's the next one.
[153:57.18]I can't wait for another clue.
[154:01.18]Round which death laughed, sepulchred emblems of dead destruction, ruin within ruin.
[154:07.78]So this is a treasure hunt.
[154:12.91]Oh.
[154:12.97]We're looking for skeletons.
[154:13.91]We're looking for the word skeleton, that's what we're looking for.
[154:20.71]Our Lady of Guadalupe, ripped from Antonia's necklace.
[154:28.86]Read it out loud in a funny voice.
[154:32.62]No.
[154:34.10]No, I understand that this is a boring mission, guys, okay?
[154:37.62]I get it.
[154:39.24]But it has to be done.
[154:46.25]What is it this time?
[154:47.51]The religious medal from the Maldonado case.
[154:49.45]The Dahlia, Moller, Maldonado.
[154:53.05]When this gets out... We still have to find the guy, Rusty.
[154:55.89]Another poem.
[154:57.69]He must have some idea, right?
[154:59.17]Come on, Phelps.
[155:02.59]We're on a roll here.
[155:03.55]Don't let me down.
[155:05.31]If only we were just having the fast food conversation now.
[155:08.25]Fourth excerpt.
[155:14.79]Let me read it again and pull out the one word that I need to remember.
[155:17.83]Fourth excerpt.
[155:20.38]Round, laugh, dead, ruin, wreck, population, mortal, monster, skeleton, statue, home, shape, gray, jam, hard.
[155:34.92]Okay.

[156:42.19]Fuck.
[157:00.37]What is that?
[157:02.05]Street crime.
[157:20.72]Anything down here?
[157:36.62]Checking the same couple of bills.
[157:37.87]I'm trying to... None of the words were there.
[157:45.73]Thank you for listening to KTI Radio.
[157:54.70]Serving California and the West Coast.
[157:57.42]Come on.
[157:59.22]Arnold, get in here.
[158:00.12]Come on.
[158:02.63]Hold on, wait.
[158:05.15]I did it wrong.
[158:06.39]Did I just get spoiled?
[158:07.47]Did somebody just spoil me?
[158:08.47]Harold, I just got spoiled.
[158:29.47]Harold, I'm sorry, but we've been spoiled.
[158:31.51]Who is Harold?
[158:34.07]So then, where is it then?
[158:35.25]If I did just get spoiled, I don't see it anywhere.
[158:39.23]That's what I just put.
[159:04.78]Oh, there's other... I didn't even know these existed.
[159:10.10]I thought these were vehicles, but apparently they're places.
[159:17.19]Skeleton.
[159:18.21]Alright.
[159:18.59]Okay.
[159:18.97]We're gonna catch hell for this.
[159:22.79]Banging up innocent men.
[159:25.41]The newspapers will crucify the guy.
[159:27.73]They won't have time to wonder about our mistakes.
[159:30.29]We'll be okay, Rusty.
[159:31.61]As long as we catch the guy.
[159:34.25]I hope you're right, Cole.
[159:35.73]We'll be famous if we make this case.
[159:40.93]It's me.
[159:41.93]I'm the killer.
[159:50.95]So, you know how, like, some references and some jokes and memes just live forever?
[159:56.55]Do you think that I made this?
[159:57.97]I did it?
[159:58.51]Do you think it's ever going to go away?
[160:01.01]Ever?
[160:02.37]I don't think it will.
[160:02.95]I think it's here forever.
[160:03.78]I won't let it.
[160:04.60]No.
[160:21.07]I wonder who actually is the first person to do it I wonder if they're here right now you know that'd be interesting if they were here
[160:54.17]What, are the streamer jokes gonna end?
[160:56.67]What do you mean, streamer jokes?
[160:59.57]I found a wall, a Walmart, a Walmart, a hall, a landmark.
[161:24.42]Watch out for me.
[161:26.18]Easy.
[161:26.64]Streamer, insert comment or current situation.
[161:50.59]Just go easy, Phelps.
[161:56.38]Bad streamer, or like streamer does.
[161:59.52]Streamer, local streamer, that kind of stuff.
[162:02.92]Streamer reads information.
[162:04.00]No, I know what you mean, no.
[162:06.89]They can't walk up this...
[162:20.05]Why did I just freeze?
[162:20.95]Can I walk in this?
[162:30.20]I'm not gonna get a game over screen if I walk in here, am I?
[162:32.66]Um...
[162:47.51]So, what's the deal?
[162:49.05]Uh, gotta go where the elephants are.
[162:53.91]It's Tar.
[162:56.37]Yeah, well, that never stopped anybody from jumping in the water in GTA.
[163:10.98]What even is Tar?
[163:16.77]What a weird substance.
[163:24.11]What the fuck?
[163:24.73]Holy shit.
[163:25.11]I thought that was actually an animal.
[163:33.60]What am I supposed to be looking at here?
[163:34.50]I mean, this is definitely a location here.
[163:51.32]Oh, there's the... There's the you found it.
[164:09.16]Alright, well... Why did you bring me all the way back here?
[164:15.57]These are my best shoes, Phelps.
[164:17.57]I'll leave you to it.
[164:19.23]Well, sure, I'll do everything.
[164:20.55]That's fine.
[164:23.87]is let me take care of literally every single thing.
[164:33.54]Reach the island.
[164:34.32]Move quickly between safe platforms.
[164:38.48]For the love of God.
[164:55.07]I am moving quick.
[164:56.09]I can't go that way.
[165:04.81]That quickly?
[165:05.47]You've died that fast?
[165:07.65]How did anybody do?
[165:08.71]Why are these boards here?
[165:09.59]Who did maintenance here?
[165:10.75]This is all fucked up.
[165:28.72]I'd be doing better if you were the one trying to get across this thing.
[165:33.36]Straight or right?
[165:34.24]Right.
[165:39.64]Easy.
[165:39.94]Get to the island.
[165:52.61]Hang a left.
[165:55.03]Steady.
[165:55.95]Okay, go right.
[165:57.16]That's at the forefront of my thinking.
[166:01.52]This is long.
[166:04.58]Right?
[166:05.80]Right.
[166:13.18]So what was... what's on here that I need?
[166:15.62]Cigarettes?
[166:17.56]Shoes?
[166:22.26]One of Theresa Tarelson's shoes.
[166:25.47]Okay.
[166:27.51]The size is size 8.
[166:28.31]And from the other opening... Okay.
[166:37.10]Where to now?
[166:41.22]Alright, sphere, crystal.
[166:44.94]Sphere, crystal, music, and light.
[166:57.24]What?
[166:57.56]Why couldn't I just get in one of these?
[166:59.30]How many are there?
[166:59.90]Fifth excerpt.
[167:29.69]This is the fifth time I've had to do this.
[167:31.15]Okay, from wood opening, the wood rushes loud and whirlwind heartbeat.
[167:35.51]Sphere.
[167:37.21]Crystal solid.
[167:38.35]Lots of sphere.
[167:42.04]Sphere.
[167:49.98]Sphere.
[167:50.72]Oh, I didn't even need that first attempt.
[167:52.50]It's right here.
[167:53.36]Got it.
[167:53.74]Done.
[168:06.27]I'm really glad it's right here.
[168:10.12]I hope this is it.
[168:11.54]This guy looks out for women in bars who've had too much to drink.
[168:15.32]Who are emotionally disturbed.
[168:17.38]Need a shoulder to cry on, he plies them with booze.
[168:20.44]Probably offers them a lift home.
[168:22.20]Then beats their brains out and strangles them.
[168:25.17]It's just a wooden fence.
[168:26.60]It's a wooden fence.
[168:27.40]You're telling me I can't drive through it?
[168:29.18]It's a really good wooden fence.
[168:30.28]Alright, now what do we have to traverse?
[168:59.73]No, don't you fucking dare.
[169:01.75]I ain't playing Resident Evil 4 again.
[169:10.87]On it goes.
[169:12.66]What do you think will reach the end of this thing?
[169:18.28]I refuse.
[169:18.72]I'm gonna try to break the game.
[169:21.56]Reach the center of the maze.
[169:26.25]Oh, okay.
[169:28.87]I'm gonna try to reach the center of the maze.
[169:37.21]You ever been in here, Gallo?
[169:38.23]I got to do that again?
[169:39.15]No.
[169:40.45]I have no intention of going in.
[169:42.85]I heard that thing's tricky.
[169:43.89]I'm gonna wait here and have a quiet smoke.
[169:49.04]Think about hidden meanings.
[169:53.99]It's been a while since I've been able to do that.
[169:56.83]Dolores, good to see you again.
[170:02.38]Where is the center of the maze?
[171:05.84]Of course, I reached the center of the maze.
[171:15.46]Once belonging to Selene Axford Henry.
[171:18.00]All right, here's the big climax right here.
[171:23.09]Well, you found me, but not so fast.
[171:27.81]Thrones, altars, judgment seats, prisons.
[171:31.91]No, it couldn't be.
[171:38.66]Okay, cutscene Thank God I was in there for a long time Took me a long time to get out
[172:17.92]All right.
[172:20.12]Let's look at the clue again.
[172:20.98]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[172:26.16]Thrones, altars, judgments, seats, prisons, wretched men, horns, swords, chains, reason, wrong, blows, ignorance, were those monsters, barbaric, ghosts, obelisks,
[172:48.99]Democratic.
[172:49.75]No.
[172:54.79]Nine beds.
[172:56.71]No.
[173:02.76]Throne.
[173:06.46]Was it a throne there?
[173:12.56]Egypt.
[173:12.96]No.
[173:14.84]I don't remember the picture.
[173:22.17]God.
[173:22.91]Court.
[173:23.35]Cage.
[173:23.93]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[173:32.80]Fuck.
[173:32.94]Thrones.
[173:33.16]Yep.
[173:33.38]I got it.
[173:52.57]Where is it?
[173:53.12]Where is it?
[173:53.58]Where is it?
[173:54.10]Right there.
[173:55.92]Throwing.
[173:57.70]Oh, I got it alright.
[173:58.96]I'm ready to go.
[174:03.39]Let's do the padded one hour long drive around town and look at landmark mission.
[174:21.77]He's leaving us this trail of evidence.
[174:25.53]Why?
[174:26.39]Vanity.
[174:27.53]He wants to see if there's anyone out there smart enough to catch him.
[174:31.48]He leaves us evidence, but every location is a trap.
[174:34.84]Why?
[174:35.04]He's testing us, physically and mentally, to see whether we are worthy of him.
[174:40.12]The Titan guy.
[174:41.60]Not to stouse with God.
[174:43.60]Very good.
[174:44.78]You thinking about reading some jelly?
[174:47.68]All that egghead stuff?
[174:50.90]I'm sticking to the funny papers.
[174:53.70]Jesus, Phelps!
[174:57.58]What's wrong with you?
[174:59.74]Ugh.
[175:01.54]Forget drones.
[175:15.25]Is this the end?
[175:16.55]Can this please be the end?
[175:20.48]I don't... I really don't want to do this anymore.
[175:26.02]It was fun running guys around and jumping on them and shooting and... ...finding out if somebody's lying or not.
[175:32.33]I don't like the treasure hunt, read the fucking comb mission.
[175:49.91]Calm down!
[175:51.13]Skip the driving.
[175:52.03]What, by marking it and making him drive?
[175:58.41]There's the throne up there.
[176:11.68]There's the throne.
[176:18.59]No, I don't want to run out.
[176:21.89]How about, like, high school story?
[176:28.01]That's what the new title of this is going to be.
[176:34.24]So this one time in high school, now, I was a pretty rough kid.
[176:39.28]I was a pretty wild kid.
[176:46.10]That's it.
[176:52.84]Can I jump to that?
[177:00.26]What am I doing?
[177:00.92]I don't know.
[177:01.58]I'm bored.
[177:02.12]Thanks.
[177:05.66]Thanks for the help.
[177:28.29]I can't just no no so from up here so I need to go down I just have to go over to where harold is
[178:09.13]Oh, that way.
[178:10.27]Okay.
[178:16.69]Thanks a lot, Harold.
[178:19.43]I appreciate it.
[178:21.54]That's not his name.
[178:24.30]It is now.
[178:32.58]Jesus, now look what you did!
[178:34.22]Hang on!
[178:34.60]What am I doing?
[178:35.06]I'll get you off of there!
[178:36.26]Whoa, Mike!
[178:37.86]Why did this turn into a Mario Party minigame?
[178:50.52]I don't understand what he's doing.
[178:51.60]You gotta make it to the next platform.
[178:54.05]Get that thing as close as you can, then jump!
[179:07.59]What am I doing now?
[179:24.96]Scaffolding?
[179:35.74]Yeah, I have to get over here, right?
[179:37.44]Do I have to jump up to here?
[179:42.74]Climb this?
[180:03.25]Apparently not.
[180:10.48]Somebody's yelling at me saying there's a ladder.
[180:16.21]Ladder.
[180:22.01]Where is there a ladder?
[180:22.83]Do I have to go down?
[180:30.20]I thought I had to go up.
[180:40.46]Okay.
[180:47.08]Alright.
[180:55.75]E. There it is.
[180:57.19]No!
[180:59.99]A seventh excerpt!
[181:01.93]Why did this game become so fucking boring?
[181:04.60]What the hell, man?
[181:17.52]This game was very interesting and fun.
[181:19.70]I really don't want to do this again.
[181:22.91]This is the seventh time.
[181:24.41]It has nothing to do with reading.
[181:29.37]It has to do with SEVEN times.
[181:34.15]Okay.
[181:40.32]There it is.
[181:40.78]Give me the cutscene.
[181:53.28]No, no, no!
[182:34.39]I thought the whole thing was going to come crashing down on you.
[182:37.59]It almost did.
[182:38.19]I thought so too.
[182:39.69]He murdered Evelyn Summers, Rusty.
[182:41.61]The last trophy was her ring.
[182:43.41]What does it say on it?
[182:44.05]The piece of the poem?
[182:45.09]Yes.
[182:46.21]I would love to say it.
[182:47.23]You sure, Cole?
[182:48.08]But it'll antagonize chat.
[182:51.80]Seventh excerpt.
[182:52.59]Here we go.
[182:53.09]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[182:58.90]remit anguish that lighted stare close thy wan lips let that thorn wounded brow stream not blood it mingles with thy tears fix fix fix those tortured orbs and peace and deaths of the sick rose shake not that crucifix so those pale figures play thy now go harble thy name I will not speak it have become a curse I know what it is
[183:31.85]You said the word crucifix.
[183:33.11]That's all I needed, right?
[183:35.92]No?
[183:36.50]Where is it?
[183:39.12]Where is it?
[183:41.46]An angel.
[183:42.18]Wait, maybe I'm wrong.
[183:43.82]Angel?
[183:58.60]There it is.
[183:59.92]That's Thorin.
[184:02.16]There it is.
[184:02.58]That's the church.
[184:03.72]I just needed to find the church.
[184:08.40]I might see this.
[184:11.21]Crucifix ain't the archaeo theater.
[184:13.01]God save Phelps.
[184:14.63]I'm not trying to justify this.
[184:16.05]Hear me out.
[184:19.09]This guy has been successfully slaughtering half of you.
[184:23.71]Maybe longer.
[184:25.15]He researches weaklings.
[184:26.97]and then plants evidence so that we always have someone to go at.
[184:29.60]If he hadn't sent the letters and the poem... Okay, where is he?
[184:34.16]Where is the bad guy?
[184:56.29]Boom!
[184:56.69]Doors break open.
[184:58.11]You found me!
[185:00.11]You'll never take me alive!
[185:01.44]He's going to be praying at the altar.
[185:07.26]Watch this.
[185:09.04]Praying at the altar.
[185:20.31]He was a religious nut the whole time!
[185:22.81]Look out!
[185:23.75]Watch out!
[185:27.42]There's a light coming from the house.
[185:30.24]Nothing hasty, gentlemen.
[185:32.48]Oh, wait, you see?
[185:34.22]I'll be forced to redecorate the stucco with your entrance.
[185:39.31]We're from the LAPD, sir.
[185:41.61]I'm going to tell you only once to lower your weapon.
[185:45.41]The LAPD, you say?
[185:47.49]Is it really possible you could have found me after all this time?
[185:52.78]Put down the gun, shit bird.
[185:54.92]Last warning.
[185:56.26]This boorish ignoramus could never have found me.
[185:58.46]It was you, wasn't it?
[186:01.82]Do you remember me, detective?
[186:03.98]The temp bartender.
[186:05.64]Yes, you found me.
[186:07.88]It was the bartender.
[186:10.82]Wait, what?
[186:14.68]What a reveal.
[186:16.44]I can't believe it.
[186:17.30]It was the temporary bartender.
[186:20.12]Not like the captain or me or...
[186:25.85]Where'd he go?
[186:32.47]Where did he go?
[186:34.31]Down the tunnel?
[186:36.03]You can't let the son of a bitch get away.
[186:39.35]The house, Rusty.
[186:40.11]There must be another entrance into the house.
[186:41.87]He did say it was me, though.
[186:49.90]Enter the catacombs.
[186:56.67]I'm gonna turn the dial.
[186:57.53]There's a secret.
[187:01.00]Any secrets?
[187:02.68]Any secrets?
[187:09.12]Secrets?
[187:17.75]Secret!
[187:26.20]Any secrets over here?
[187:27.06]Secret!
[187:34.85]Okay, never mind.
[188:07.22]Uh... Okay.
[188:14.35]LAPD!
[188:15.31]Give yourself up!
[188:25.53]I... I don't know if he's in... Apparently you are in here somewhere.
[188:35.37]Come on in.
[188:39.37]You mean like the bedroom?
[188:43.81]Where the hell is this guy?
[188:51.10]Uh... Okay.
[188:58.34]Is he just hiding in here?
[188:59.42]I mean, there's a door.
[189:01.92]I couldn't open this door.
[189:02.94]Could I open this one?
[189:03.60]Alright, I can open this one.
[189:07.55]Wait, Jesus.
[189:11.76]You realize this must have been the place, Rusty.
[189:15.00]This is where he did it all.
[189:17.08]That's fucked up.
[189:25.94]It's the basis for all his riddles.
[189:28.30]Prometheus defied the cruel gods.
[189:30.78]This guy thinks he's doing the same thing.
[189:32.10]No, it's the basest from that.
[189:33.58]I thought he said it was the basest.
[189:34.40]Finding gods can be hazardous to your health.
[189:37.77]Wow, that is kind of like a bassist pose, isn't it?
[189:39.86]I really don't even need to try this guy.
[189:49.00]This is evidence, right?
[189:49.96]I kind of need to look at it.
[190:04.65]Had a cool experience, baby.
[190:06.11]At least some working knowledge of biology.
[190:09.29]He's cruel and he's methodical.
[190:12.29]Anything else?
[190:12.79]I don't think so.
[190:17.73]Well... Kill Garrett Mason.
[190:28.47]I'll go.
[190:29.39]So not even... Call for backup and keep an eye out above ground and see where the stick comes out.
[190:32.79]Capture... arrest... kill...
[190:35.00]Oh, there he is.
[190:45.00]Why is he holding the gun like that?
[190:56.57]He got the hat.
[191:00.77]Alright, just fuck this, man.
[191:08.94]Go put him in the bathtub.
[191:14.64]Where's the press, Cap?
[191:17.00]I think Phelps and I should get a medal for this.
[191:18.86]This has got to be the case of the year, right?
[191:21.59]The case of the century when you think about it.
[191:23.47]Are you finished?
[191:25.11]Yes, Skipper.
[191:26.13]Good.
[191:27.96]Because there won't be any press briefings or commendations.
[191:31.20]It was my son.
[191:31.82]What are you talking about?
[191:33.78]We got the werewolf, the guy who killed the Dahlia, killed all the other broads.
[191:37.86]You got no one.
[191:39.74]Mason was a ghost.
[191:40.78]Can you at least tell us why, Captain?
[191:44.53]Mason is the half-brother of one of the most highly elected officials in this country.
[191:49.17]How high?
[191:52.11]Beyond the moon for mere mortals like us, Rusty.
[191:56.08]There'll be no more mention of him.
[191:58.21]The senator's half-brother.
[192:00.59]There'll be no mileage in ever bringing this up again.
[192:02.67]What's gonna happen to the suspects in the cases, Captain?
[192:05.11]I won't be a part of that.
[192:06.01]A bit of missing evidence at the grand jury.
[192:11.09]Procedural error here, mistake there.
[192:14.37]They'll all be quietly let go.
[192:17.49]The D.A.
[192:17.99]knows how we'll have to play it.
[192:19.73]That's it?
[192:21.21]I'm afraid it is.
[192:23.95]And I have some news for you folks.
[192:26.69]No more rooting around in the entrails of cadavers and corpses for you.
[192:31.03]The head of vice has asked to chief you.
[192:34.83]I'm reluctant to see you go to the glory boys of that vice, but my hands are tied.
[192:41.06]Go home to that lovely wife of yours.
[192:43.18]The real villain was politics.
[192:55.12]Apparently...
[192:58.16]The Simple Art of Murder.
[192:59.28]Case Report.
[193:00.46]15 out of 15.
[193:05.84]Who is injured?
[193:08.62]Remains open the truth lost to all but a handful of men.
[193:13.85]Prepare for reassignment.
[193:17.57]Breathe out, kid.
[193:24.19]You'll go purple.
[193:25.91]I'm scared, Sarge.
[193:27.19]Everybody's scared, kid.
[193:29.03]Anyone who says he isn't is a damn liar.
[193:32.03]How many times have you been in combat, Sarge?
[193:34.38]I was with Raider Battalion on Peleliu my first time.
[193:37.50]Was it bad?
[193:38.96]It's always bad.
[193:40.36]Will this be bad?
[193:41.91]As bad as it gets, kid.
[193:43.53]As bad?
[193:44.03]Is it gonna be bad?
[193:44.85]It's always bad.
[193:46.23]Will this be bad?
[193:48.09]Some of the guys, they aren't very friendly so much.
[193:50.89]They've lost a lot of their friends in the last couple of days, kid.
[193:53.67]They think if they don't get to know you that they won't have to grieve for you if you get killed.
[193:57.59]They're wrong.
[193:58.56]It doesn't work that way.
[194:00.08]Don't worry.
[194:01.04]No Marine in this company will let you down.
[194:08.52]Okay.
[194:12.32]So, what's next?
[194:14.94]Black Caesar.
[194:21.89]Hollywood Police Station.
[194:26.73]Phelps, welcome to Vice.
[194:29.29]This is your new partner, Roy Earl.
[194:32.27]Take a seat.
[194:33.97]Roy Earl.
[194:34.47]A special request was made to transfer you to Add Vice.
[194:38.89]We need a man with your kind of starch on this desk, son.
[194:42.81]We have two dead Negroes found in an apartment this morning on Yucca Street.
[194:47.71]Number 6358, apartment 5.
[194:49.39]We've got better things to be doing than wasting our time on two dead junkies.
[194:54.07]Did I ask your opinion, detective?
[194:57.31]Two men dead on U.S.
[194:58.65]Army-issue morphine.
[195:00.70]That makes it an advice case.
[195:04.42]Beat it!
[195:05.88]Yes, sir.
[195:08.32]Oh, is this my partner?
[195:09.60]I remember this guy.
[195:10.80]This guy sucks.
[195:13.64]Ugh.
[195:15.14]You and the lieutenant have some history?
[195:18.04]You could say that.
[195:19.10]I thought he stepped out of the way and was like that other guy behind him.
[195:22.34]So, you're working with the big boys now, Cole?
[195:24.54]I guess so, Roy.
[195:26.50]I thought homicide was the primo assignment.
[195:31.04]That may be the case.
[195:32.96]I asked for you personally, Phelps.
[195:34.72]I had to pull a few strings to get you over to Advice.
[195:37.60]How does it feel?
[195:40.48]The lieutenant seems to think I'm doing okay.
[195:44.67]Okay?
[195:46.79]Don't get humble on me, Phelps.
[195:49.33]You're doing great.
[195:50.49]You're the department pinup boy.
[195:52.53]War hero and crime fighter.
[195:54.47]What a combination.
[195:57.02]I can assure you I'm no war hero, detective.
[196:02.52]Let's rouse some hopheads.
[196:05.66]Investigate the crime scene.
[196:13.13]When is polar bear golfing?
[196:14.53]Nice car, Roy.
[196:15.89]Is that department issue?
[196:17.99]Uh, never.
[196:18.83]No, this is my sled.
[196:21.31]You can't be seen slumming it in a Nash if you're in vice, Cole.
[196:25.23]Meanwhile, we got needle freaks kissing.
[196:27.14]Wait, do I have another...
[196:33.56]Outfits?
[196:34.71]He's about to be standing.
[196:39.51]Wreck his car.
[196:40.27]Look where you're going!
[197:19.76]Not going to say anything about his car.
[197:20.58]You can't do this.
[197:21.56]Oh, I'm so starstruck.
[197:22.28]Oh.
[197:54.27]I discovered a landmark!
[197:57.19]Whoa, whoa!
[197:58.75]Easy, whoa!
[198:09.80]Phelps is the swimming guy, right?
[198:13.18]Uh, yes.
[198:14.75]Phelps is the swimming guy.
[198:27.56]What's going on here we drop a couple frames looks like it
[198:47.05]He seems pretty happy about it.
[198:48.15]A couple of frames.
[198:48.65]More like a million frames.
[199:22.96]How long you think you can hold out Let's move up Oh Fuck he's getting it
[199:51.96]Got him.
[199:52.30]That's it.
[199:53.94]That's all of them.
[199:58.46]Good thing my partner can shoot.
[200:14.23]That's it.
[200:23.61]20 out of 40 Street Primes complete.
[200:27.61]Nice.
[200:27.93]I earned an achievement.
[200:31.41]Johnny on the spot.
[200:36.03]We still good on frames?
[200:48.52]Yeah.
[200:49.84]A little hiccup.
[200:52.48]It's bound to happen.
[200:56.86]Dropping 400 frames in three and a half hours is... I'll take it.
[201:01.86]Christ!
[201:05.14]Okay.
[201:09.17]Crime scene.
[201:16.69]What are you doing?
[201:17.85]What did I hit?
[201:20.77]I hit a divot in the ground?
[201:35.91]Okay, here we go.
[201:36.69]Yes.
[201:36.85]I want to see?
[201:37.53]Uh... No.
[201:37.65]Carry on.
[201:37.93]I want to see.
[201:39.31]Okay.
[202:07.76]I've got friends who work at the Examiner.
[202:09.65]Oh, sure.
[202:10.83]About $50 for an exclusive.
[202:13.59]Where's the actual crime scene?
[202:17.99]Up here?
[202:28.11]No.
[202:30.47]You're coming from a crime scene.
[202:31.31]Come on, Doug.
[202:32.74]Your show now.
[202:36.25]He said up the stairs.
[202:37.13]I'm just looking around.
[202:37.98]I'm just looking around.
[202:39.32]Jesus.
[202:41.36]What have we got?
[202:42.80]Two stiffs.
[202:43.82]Overdosed.
[202:44.94]Been dead a couple of days.
[202:46.66]Government issue morphine?
[202:48.40]We use the same surets in Okinawa.
[202:51.02]Fucking negro junkies can't take supply this pure.
[202:54.00]You know these guys?
[202:55.66]I know of them.
[202:56.96]The younger one's a two-bit horn player by the name of Cornell Tyree.
[203:00.89]The other one works in distribution.
[203:03.07]Started using a little too much of his own product and Jack D took exception.
[203:07.45]He wasn't born that ugly.
[203:09.34]His name's Lamont.
[203:11.06]Tyrone Lamont.
[203:12.76]I don't like this guy's tie either.
[203:14.14]So who's supplying the drugs?
[203:16.06]That's easy.
[203:16.86]Whoever knocked off the wharves in San Pedro.
[203:19.87]Jack Dragna, Mickey Cohen.
[203:21.81]Dope's been all upside down ever since Jimmy Utley started the long walk at Quentin.
[203:26.07]Finally, this guy sucks.
[203:27.83]And he's wearing, like, a tampon tie.
[203:32.09]We are supposed to uphold the law.
[203:33.55]What the hell is this tie?
[203:34.51]Yeah, and we do.
[203:35.93]But we can't change people.
[203:38.94]The truth is, everyone wants the license to get a little dirty now and then.
[203:43.54]Our job is to keep it manageable.
[203:45.28]That's how you see it?
[203:47.22]Contact lens cases.
[203:51.36]Can we get on with this today, preferably?
[203:58.78]Okay.
[204:00.30]So we get a wallet.
[204:03.48]Once the red is enough to knock you off a combat drum, two of them will stop your heart.
[204:10.59]There it is.
[204:17.42]Interesting.
[204:17.90]Does he have anything else?
[204:18.92]Another wallet.
[204:47.83]You always check the wallets first.
[204:48.95]Okay.
[205:18.47]So wallet on ground, wallet on guy.
[205:20.77]Find anything interesting?
[205:23.25]Cheat music.
[205:23.75]I wonder what's the correlation between love of the needle and love of the music.
[205:47.60]Some kind of fruit?
[205:48.82]A bell?
[205:49.40]It's a slot machine.
[205:51.84]Strange doodle.
[205:55.56]You catch all the good ones, Phelps.
[205:58.97]What did I miss?
[206:01.39]People are yelling at me.
[206:03.51]Okay.
[206:11.49]Who is JJ?
[206:12.13]And why do these two care about his taste in music?
[206:16.81]He listens to 275 FM.
[206:18.67]Anything else on this guy?
[206:25.01]Find anything interesting?
[206:32.98]Looks like it was always going to end this way.
[206:52.27]Never the same, are they?
[206:53.67]Nothing else?
[206:54.17]Okay.
[207:02.54]Did I pick up this?
[207:03.78]What is on the- oh, it's popcorn.
[207:08.96]Black Caesar.
[207:10.73]From the joint across the street.
[207:16.43]Looks like something was taped to the bottom of the cup.
[207:23.60]That's really weird looking popcorn.
[207:28.68]It's almost like a... Keyed in.
[207:37.85]Took his jolt and drifted off.
[207:40.19]And I suppose his friend wasn't in any condition to notice that he had stopped breathing.
[207:46.79]Nothing else.
[207:52.86]Superglue.
[207:55.57]Morphine.
[207:56.19]And this one last piece here.
[207:57.73]Kitchen.
[208:26.09]Bread.
[208:28.19]A bit heavy for an empty cup.
[208:32.25]Something in this one?
[208:34.55]Well.
[208:34.95]There it is.
[208:35.23]Food hut.
[208:35.53]Okay.
[208:35.67]Eggs.
[208:35.81]Come on.
[208:36.01]There's eggs on the ground.
[208:36.83]So that's it.
[208:57.79]You catch all the good ones, Phelps.
[208:59.97]Hey, thanks.
[209:00.33]Is there nothing else to look at?
[209:18.18]I don't think so.
[209:26.36]Wasn't it night four minutes ago?
[209:34.62]Let's go to the food hut.
[209:37.38]Right.
[209:38.22]Let's wrap this up before I actually have to work overtime instead of just claiming for it.
[209:44.07]Time moves really fast in LA.
[209:44.99]You're a true inspiration to us all, Roy.
[209:46.95]Apparently it does.
[209:52.35]It's right here.
[209:53.35]OK.
[209:59.76]Help you?
[210:00.80]Detectives Phelps and Earl, LAPD.
[210:03.56]We're inquiring into the deaths of... Hand over the popcorn, numbskull, before we kick the door in.
[210:09.02]Uh, you know, I was actually just... Get that son of a bitch.
[210:14.63]Come here.
[210:15.91]Give us the popcorn.
[210:32.67]I was waiting for it.
[210:33.57]I knew it was gonna happen, too.
[210:42.74]I was going too fast.
[210:43.72]The game was like, hey, you're doing- you're going too fast.
[210:46.29]You can just slow down.
[211:04.35]Haven't I done this bit, like, ten times already?
[211:08.26]Yep.
[211:09.64]I sure have.
[211:10.48]Did I lose?
[211:17.87]Eddie, help me out, man!
[211:18.77]They're trying to kill me!
[211:19.45]You gotta help me out!
[211:20.75]What the hell going on here?
[211:22.71]Martin!
[211:24.15]That you?
[211:25.99]You picked the wrong cop, you fucking animals.
[211:34.58]Oh, I'm pressing circle.
[211:36.95]A different Rockstar game.
[211:39.61]This is going to end in tears.
[212:11.85]Uh, he's on the ground.
[212:14.13]He's- I- alright.
[212:15.93]That's a creepy smile.
[212:17.37]Oh.
[212:41.98]Wallet?
[212:48.04]I doubt it.
[212:48.48]It should be stamped on the reverse by the issuer.
[213:01.37]It was the trumpet.
[213:02.91]Here's the plunger.
[213:03.59]Something in here.
[213:09.43]Payout 625.
[213:10.13]These number slips might affect your tone, Fleetwood.
[213:15.83]Okay.
[213:18.84]That's a silencer.
[213:19.98]It's a trumpet silencer.
[213:35.83]Morphing.
[213:37.66]Might not be filling, but I'm sure it's satisfying.
[213:40.48]There it is.
[213:47.25]What else you putting in the popcorn here?
[213:50.53]Eggs?
[213:50.81]See, I told you we needed to look at eggs.
[213:52.35]Optimistic, Cole.
[213:54.04]Oh.
[213:58.92]Doesn't tell me anything.
[214:02.88]Not at all.
[214:07.13]Oh, what am I?
[214:07.65]Ooh.
[214:11.04]Somebody's gonna eat all this.
[214:14.92]Should I turn the stove off?
[214:21.61]Reverse side of ticket.
[214:33.19]Okay.
[214:34.43]What would I do without you guys?
[214:37.17]About time we heard what Fleetwood here has to say, Cole.
[214:48.32]All right, let's see.
[214:53.51]Advice?
[214:55.01]Get the kid's story.
[214:56.29]He's a small fry, but he could give... We're inquiring about the deaths of two men in an apartment across the street, Fleetwood.
[215:01.89]We want answers.
[215:04.00]Of course.
[215:05.24]I'll do my best, mister.
[215:06.66]Chad is the second mind.
[215:10.04]Yeah, I just need to look over here and see, like, the word, and I go, oh, that, like, I need to find that word that I just saw.
[215:20.50]You sold the drugs to Cornell Tyree and Tyrone Lamont.
[215:23.70]Oh, I sell... I sell fried steaks and black-eyed peas.
[215:29.82]Well, I'm sorry...
[215:32.78]Buddy, you have morphine inside of your boxes.
[215:35.50]I can.
[215:36.06]I can.
[215:36.28]Okay, if that was in the apartment.
[215:38.18]Here it is.
[215:54.11]flipping burgers and strapping jolts of morphine to the bottom of popcorn cups, Fleetwood.
[215:59.35]Now I want the truth.
[216:00.95]Who supplies the drugs?
[216:02.39]Cat by the name of Armstrong Edwards.
[216:05.15]He brings his stuff around about once a day.
[216:08.03]I know Armstrong.
[216:09.25]He's a two-bounce, strictly small-time.
[216:11.75]Who's he working for, Fleetwood?
[216:15.18]Jermaine Jones.
[216:18.24]Okay.
[216:19.18]We got our distributor.
[216:21.35]We have you for the hop and resisting arrest.
[216:24.85]Tell us about the numbers if you want our help.
[216:26.77]Look, the numbers are the white man's tax on poor folk.
[216:30.19]All right, now what else you want to know?
[216:36.15]Looking at the ground.
[216:44.89]We have an address on the slips.
[216:46.75]We're gonna go down there now and rat you out, Fleetwood.
[216:49.46]Tell whoever it is that you rolled over and gave them up.
[216:52.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:53.84]Look, I've been cooperative, okay?
[216:55.52]Now, you gotta help me some.
[216:57.24]Fleetwood, I'm gonna speak personally to the judge on your behalf.
[217:00.72]A name, Fleetwood.
[217:02.52]He's a real slick dude.
[217:04.51]Wears a hat and swings a cane.
[217:05.83]Goes by the name of Merlin, all right?
[217:07.13]I ain't got a last name.
[217:09.87]See you at the station, Fleetwood.
[217:13.01]Wait, you're gonna help me, right?
[217:15.20]Of course, kid.
[217:16.24]You helped us out.
[217:17.64]We always like to repay a favor.
[217:20.00]Can you see that Fleetwood gets a nice cell, Wallace?
[217:22.72]One with a window and a nice fresh pillow.
[217:32.77]Oh.
[217:38.27]I see phone on map.
[217:39.47]I talk phone.
[217:41.93]Operator, message for KGPL.
[217:46.02]I'm putting you through now.
[217:49.56]Phelps, batch 1247.
[217:52.89]How can I help, detective?
[217:55.21]I need an address on a Jermaine Jones musical booking agency.
[218:00.35]Just a moment, detective.
[218:03.71]Jermaine Jones.
[218:05.13]The office is listed as 5528 Santa Monica Boulevard.
[218:09.44]This is my favorite voice actress in the whole thing.
[218:12.50]She sounds so real.
[218:16.50]That's just... I'm just kind of reading.
[218:18.60]That's it.
[218:18.96]Who cares?
[218:26.81]Numbers operation.
[218:30.21]That's where we're going.
[218:30.99]Gambling den and lottery operation.
[218:32.67]Work address of Merlin Auty.
[218:35.35]Okay.
[219:00.60]Otto.
[219:03.09]Otto peed.
[219:04.11]Uh, yeah, that's funny.
[219:05.23]He's right behind me.
[219:06.11]You can't pull that same bullshit twice.
[219:12.19]That doesn't work twice.
[219:14.31]Phelps!
[219:18.18]You wanna see Otto?
[219:31.83]You will.
[219:32.29]Let's do it.
[219:43.73]Show us now.
[219:44.69]I can't.
[219:45.05]I'm driving this car.
[219:46.29]Give me a second.
[219:47.07]All right, here.
[220:02.20]You want to see Otto?
[220:06.92]It's too dark in here.
[220:07.96]Hold on.
[220:15.26]Turn it up.
[220:22.30]It's still too dark.
[220:23.08]You're not going to be able to see him that well.
[220:41.28]No, you're not gonna be able to see him.
[220:43.16]I'll grab him.
[220:45.36]Hold on.
[220:50.05]Look, he was just trying to sleep.
[220:56.77]Now I have to bring him in front of the camera?
[221:03.02]Cole, we got things to do?
[221:06.87]You know, he smells the peanut butter and banana.
[221:10.40]Dogs go crazy for that shit.
[221:12.76]Can you hear him sniffing into the microphone?
[221:15.56]Hey, what are you doing?
[221:22.79]Yes.
[221:24.23]Yes.
[221:25.15]Your breath stinks.
[221:26.67]Alright, back to it.
[221:27.68]Back to what you were doing.
[221:30.24]Peanut dog.
[221:42.92]Keep the face cam there at that size while playing.
[221:45.56]I did that joke already.
[221:50.19]That was a joke from eons ago.
[221:54.09]Alright, do I have my... Speaking of camera.
[221:58.97]Okay, just making sure I have it off.
[222:01.50]Alright.
[222:02.70]That's the only reason why I watch.
[222:04.08]Well, I'm glad you're here watching.
[222:11.41]Detectives Phelps and Earl, LAPD.
[222:13.39]The name's Marilyn Odie.
[222:16.58]I run a strictly legitimate bookmakers, detective.
[222:19.74]So that's not an illegal wire service that your colleagues are running?
[222:22.68]And the number slips that I've been picking up all morning with this address on them have nothing to do with you?
[222:27.83]I pay my kick to the wops, and they pay their cut to the LAPD.
[222:31.86]You can't go shaking me down.
[222:33.64]You're a loud mouth motherfucker, aren't you?
[222:36.60]Anyone ever tell you the criminals are supposed to keep their mouths shut?
[222:40.25]Stay where you are while we look around.
[222:42.13]Okay.
[222:49.73]Hold on.
[222:50.89]Okay.
[222:55.74]Trying to... What are you doing over there?
[222:59.34]Now he's like trying to have fun.
[223:04.25]Finishing the end of my smoothie.
[223:08.35]Alright.
[223:12.04]Golf clubs.
[223:13.36]Baseball.
[223:16.54]Nothing.
[223:24.28]Lamp.
[223:24.78]Record player.
[223:28.71]We got a...
[223:34.20]Moose paper.
[223:34.88]We got telephones.
[223:40.39]Why so many phones?
[223:41.21]Slot machine!
[224:05.74]I'll just lick the button and press to hold a symbol.
[224:10.01]Oh, hold on.
[224:16.27]Where's that thing?
[224:18.77]No.
[224:22.22]Cherry Bell win.
[224:30.28]So we need Cherry Bell.
[224:31.95]We get Cherry in the first slot.
[224:35.70]Oh, I was just one.
[224:42.80]Cherry.
[224:43.44]Cherry.
[224:44.28]Hold the cherry, please.
[224:49.06]Cherry Bell.
[224:52.23]No.
[224:54.67]You can't do this on slot machines.
[224:56.85]You can't hold a symbol forever.
[225:08.00]Got it.
[225:10.74]And here's all the morphine.
[225:12.02]There's a lot in here.
[225:17.62]And we got tickets.
[225:18.24]Free morphine!
[225:18.74]That's what you win.
[225:37.42]Oh, that's quite a win for a dime, Merlin.
[225:39.54]You better start talking.
[225:41.31]Get after him, Phelps.
[225:43.19]Chase.
[225:43.93]Give it up, Artie.
[225:57.37]Go after him, Phelps.
[226:00.02]Okay.
[226:05.72]Who did that?
[226:07.46]This is a secure area.
[226:08.66]You all need to leave.
[226:14.06]How do I stop him?
[226:16.64]Alright, alright, relax motherfucker, you got me.
[226:20.92]He ran into somebody.
[226:22.66]Too bad you couldn't pull off your vanishing act.
[226:25.92]Make your jokes, my guy.
[226:27.34]But don't damage that.
[226:28.74]That there is a valuable antique.
[226:31.90]You don't say.
[226:33.98]Maybe you ought to have a look at this, Cole.
[226:41.69]okay let's look at look at the what is this is a this is a what is it I think that's it would you like to calculate the odds on you going to prison for a very long time merlin
[227:12.03]Where'd you get the morphine?
[227:12.85]Lie.
[227:39.15]Okay Merlin, behave like a moron.
[227:41.73]The two dead guys, I'm telling the DA that you sold them the hop.
[227:45.79]Are you hearing this?
[227:48.23]Loud and clear, motherfucker.
[227:50.87]I have chips, and I'm not throwing my cards in this easy.
[227:57.81]Ramez seems to owe you a lot of money.
[227:59.95]We all owe somebody.
[228:06.16]That's it?
[228:13.06]So it has nothing to do with the proceeds of the morphine shipment?
[228:16.84]It's a gambling debt.
[228:18.48]The heaps took over the Y service and screwed me.
[228:21.28]Now I just do what I'm told.
[228:22.84]Run numbers and shift dope.
[228:24.72]Jose's no different.
[228:26.52]He just thinks he's a big man that can run up tabs.
[228:31.04]You're not the guy we want, Merlin.
[228:32.63]But we're taking you in.
[228:33.89]Maybe some time will sell when I remember something worthwhile.
[228:37.35]Fuck you, and fuck you.
[228:40.29]You'll never put a charge on me.
[228:44.58]I was just gonna make the joke.
[228:48.71]I can't- I was just gonna make that joke about how like, oh and then it cuts to him in a squad car.
[228:54.33]I didn't make it because I made it already.
[228:58.39]I almost wish I said it now.
[229:02.54]That's unfortunate.
[229:03.30]I was gonna say it.
[229:14.44]Mickey Cohen runs the dope rack?
[229:16.16]Always sunny theme plays.
[229:18.48]Mickey does what he's told.
[229:20.64]Benny Siegel will take a cut if any action is gone.
[229:24.73]I thought Jack Dragna was... Dragna's an old-time greaser.
[229:28.89]He keeps his head down and pays his dues.
[229:31.35]Word is he's gonna clip Bugsy.
[229:34.23]Whose word?
[229:36.25]What does it matter?
[229:37.73]One lowlife killing another lowlife makes our job easier.
[229:42.80]I'm just gonna go here.
[229:44.10]I already arrested the guy.
[229:45.76]Can I do anything?
[229:46.82]Sounds like me singing.
[230:13.75]Don't take notes while you drive.
[230:15.69]That's true.
[230:16.45]You shouldn't do anything like that.
[230:28.18]Thank God we're not in my car.
[230:32.07]Well, that's because I destroyed your car.
[230:34.35]In front of you, and I burnt it.
[230:36.31]So... I don't know what you mean by that, exactly.
[230:41.51]Goddamn maniac!
[230:50.98]Is there a penalty for running people over?
[230:52.38]There's a penalty for doing any damage at all.
[230:55.92]Bumping into cars, hitting anybody, you get a monetary penalty.
[231:00.08]Every single fender bender.
[231:01.22]I thought it was this door, I thought it was that door, and we were gonna get a cutscene.
[231:10.82]I thought wrong.
[231:15.31]Do you use money?
[231:16.65]No, I do not believe so.
[231:17.83]At least not at this point, not that I can tell.
[231:25.81]Look at this place.
[231:27.71]I'm guessing not much talent comes out of this talent agency.
[231:32.23]Not much.
[231:38.10]But, wait.
[231:42.79]We're looking for two, three, eight.
[231:44.29]Here we are, Jermaine Jones, 238.
[231:55.34]Two, four, one, two, three, nine, two, three, eight.
[232:02.37]Hey.
[232:03.51]Hey.
[232:03.87]Who let you in?
[232:05.43]I did.
[232:06.73]Your door was unlocked.
[232:08.67]Jermaine Jones.
[232:09.83]Don't bother getting up.
[232:11.40]Your flunky Fleetwood Morgan just snitched you out.
[232:14.20]I wasn't planning to.
[232:16.84]Now you think you can tell me who the hell you are?
[232:19.64]LAPD.
[232:20.48]We're cropped.
[232:20.86]We'd like to take a look around.
[232:22.73]The hell you will, motherfucker.
[232:25.03]You carrying a warrant?
[232:28.01]No, do we need one?
[232:31.37]Search the place, Cole.
[232:35.05]What do you think you're gonna find, policeman?
[232:39.63]Scott Phantom?
[232:41.73]Find radio.
[232:42.23]AM, FM.
[232:43.39]Shortwave, AM and FM.
[232:45.51]My father has a Scott.
[232:48.59]You have no right to do this.
[232:50.27]I got rights.
[232:51.39]Do I have, like, any megahertz here?
[232:57.64]Radio station note!
[233:01.58]275 FM.
[233:04.58]Let's get the morphine out of here, too.
[233:09.68]So we got FM.
[233:13.60]Now we have to tune it.
[233:21.90]Oh.
[233:24.14]That's volume.
[233:27.04]You're not max.
[233:35.39]Two, seventy, five.
[233:44.11]Bingo!
[233:46.63]We got cauliflower.
[233:48.21]We got pencil erasers.
[233:51.25]Brandon, Wilt, get over here.
[233:54.91]Take these assholes apart.
[233:57.87]You heard the boss.
[234:02.67]More fighting.
[234:04.05]Is this the best you got?
[234:05.14]These mugs are dope to the eyeballs.
[234:08.82]Clean them up quick, boys.
[234:09.90]I ain't got time for this.
[234:11.64]Come on, come on.
[234:12.64]Beat these sons of bitches down.
[234:17.88]Sit tight, asshole.
[234:19.65]Pretend you're at the parlor getting your nails done.
[234:22.61]Cole, you better search through that stuff on the radio before you brace our friend here.
[234:30.27]Come on.
[234:32.33]Money.
[234:33.53]There must be at least $30 in here.
[234:35.11]How many starving musicians pay with perfect clean 50s?
[234:39.40]50?
[234:43.94]Too much for felony possession.
[234:46.10]I'm thinking intent to supply.
[234:51.84]We also have another super glue morphine.
[234:54.92]392.
[234:54.96]What was that?
[235:15.29]Ramez removals.
[235:16.43]Ramez removals.
[235:17.07]They must have taken special care delivering this for you.
[235:21.52]Okay.
[235:23.92]Well, would you look at that?
[235:25.40]Now let's talk.
[235:38.36]Lamont and Tyree are dead.
[235:40.22]At a stretch, the DA could have you on felony murder for supplying stolen government... Tyrone and Cornell are dead.
[235:47.02]They're on a slab downtown with the ME examining their last meal.
[235:50.80]Popcorn washed down with morphine.
[235:54.78]You offering me a deal?
[235:56.84]I have a pet judge who hates blacks.
[235:59.58]He'll give you 50 years for your two buddies, another 30 for stealing from Uncle Sam.
[236:04.33]You'll be out by the time you're 110.
[236:08.25]Imagine the changes you'll see.
[236:12.09]I get the message.
[236:14.10]How much is this going to cost me?
[236:19.56]Okay.
[236:22.50]Who supplies the morphine?
[236:23.90]Where is the morphine?
[236:24.70]I don't know nothing about that.
[236:30.35]It's in your jukebox over there, man.
[236:38.93]So we make you for all of it.
[236:40.39]You're the fall guy from Mickey Cohen.
[236:42.27]You're the fall guy.
[236:43.23]In case you haven't noticed, I'm a colored man.
[236:46.59]You see any Jew boys running around here?
[236:49.91]I collect my cut.
[236:51.77]Lenny the Fink controls the action.
[236:53.91]Lenny who?
[236:55.35]Lenny Finkelstein.
[236:56.93]Mickey's dipshit brother-in-law.
[237:01.82]Okay.
[237:02.76]What is the link between the morphine and the numbers slips?
[237:05.74]There is no link.
[237:08.65]You're wasting your time here.
[237:13.79]His face.
[237:16.79]His face went like immediately from confident to whoa.
[237:23.73]He just got sad.
[237:28.26]You either rat out the next link in the chain or you spend the rest of your life in jail.
[237:33.16]Are you gonna put that in writing, asshole?
[237:39.50]What's the score with Remez removals?
[237:41.70]I brought a radio from there.
[237:43.94]That's all.
[237:50.53]What are these faces?
[238:05.58]I kind of want to just watch for a little while.
[238:25.79]Oh, he's back to being... Oh, no, no, no.
[238:27.37]He was sad there for a second.
[238:29.71]This is okay.
[238:30.21]You know those artificial intelligence robot demonstrations?
[238:34.74]Where the... It's like that mannequin face will go from sad to happy to scared to crying.
[238:40.58]It's just one of those tech demos.
[238:46.53]So when we visit Rem as removals and tell them that we want a special bookcase or wardrobe to hide our dope in, you're gonna be copacetic?
[238:55.22]And when we tell them their good friend Jermaine sent us and said they could do a nice deal for the LAPD... I could use an act like you two.
[239:02.64]There's Fux Abbot and Costello on the slide.
[239:07.96]Hollywood could use another couple of deeply unfunny white bread humps like you.
[239:11.79]Very good, Jermaine.
[239:13.53]You have character.
[239:15.03]Now cough it up.
[239:16.03]Ramez is a good friend of Lenny the Fink.
[239:19.27]You getting the picture?
[239:22.31]Take them all in.
[239:23.29]We have a deal, right?
[239:25.67]We're after the morphine.
[239:27.16]I'll speak to the DA on your behalf.
[239:29.14]You have my word.
[239:32.72]What?
[239:45.52]Okay.
[239:51.24]Phone.
[239:57.27]Phelps, badge 1247.
[240:00.95]How can I help, detective?
[240:03.35]I need an address for Ramez Removals.
[240:05.14]That's Ramez, R-A-M-E-Z.
[240:05.82]Just checking.
[240:06.64]Ramez Removals, corner Sunset and Wilton.
[240:09.94]Owned by a Jose Victor Ramirez.
[240:15.37]Thanks, man.
[240:16.59]Thanks.
[240:21.28]Oh, it's the three briefcase boys.
[240:24.42]They all have the same briefcase.
[240:35.42]So Mickey Cohen or Jack Dragner stole the army surplus morphine and they are selling it on the streets?
[240:40.67]They're on their way to the briefcase convention.
[240:42.31]Looks that way.
[240:44.28]But the mob wants returned customers, not corpses.
[240:47.06]Why haven't they cut the morphing?
[240:50.38]Good question, detective.
[240:53.40]This robbery happened months ago, right?
[240:57.14]The beginning of the year.
[240:58.06]So why are the proceeds suddenly turning up now?
[241:03.54]Another good question.
[241:04.76]But where does it get us?
[241:07.64]I think I'm doing okay.
[241:08.88]Am I going to finish this game?
[241:10.42]Definitely not tonight.
[241:11.22]That's for sure.
[241:35.22]LAPD.
[241:36.56]We're here to see Jose Ramez.
[241:38.34]What's it about?
[241:39.56]Routine inquiries, sir.
[241:41.27]Can you tell us where we can find him?
[241:42.59]You missed him.
[241:44.97]He was in the delivery truck.
[241:46.17]Just went out.
[241:46.95]God damn it.
[241:48.13]Good luck.
[241:52.93]11K calling KGPL.
[241:53.92]Go ahead, 11K.
[241:57.10]11K requesting assistance in pursuit of narcotic suspects aboard a GM delivery truck.
[242:02.10]Commercial license David Charles 457.
[242:04.16]Roger, 11K.
[242:07.72]Well, I thought I had it.
[242:09.84]What does this lunatic think he's doing?
[242:11.14]What the hell are you doing?
[242:12.50]Hit him, Cole.
[242:13.36]Spit him out.
[242:14.84]We're not playing around here.
[242:16.18]Get this clown off the road.
[242:17.67]He just got chaired.
[242:20.17]Oh no, here comes the sofa!
[242:23.39]Here comes the cavalry.
[242:24.23]Don't do the fridge.
[242:26.07]Don't do the fridge.
[242:26.89]Let's see how fast he runs on bare rims.
[242:29.55]He's over the head.
[242:31.69]Hit him.
[242:32.37]Clear this asshole off the road.
[242:34.99]That's too bad.
[242:35.69]I really was wishing he was gonna throw the fridge.
[242:43.10]Step on it, huh?
[242:44.10]Just give me a little closer.
[242:49.45]He's going left onto Hollywood.
[242:50.91]Get alongside him and take him out.
[242:56.83]Show me your hands!
[242:59.93]He's going for the sink.
[243:08.90]No tires.
[243:11.77]Do I have a DLC?
[243:13.65]I do not.
[243:15.35]Unless it's bundled in the PS4 version, I don't know.
[243:21.48]Hey, hold your horses.
[243:24.26]I supply furniture, not drugs.
[243:27.38]And that thing back there?
[243:28.40]That was an accident.
[243:30.72]Some furniture came loose.
[243:33.18]That's all.
[243:34.34]Save it for the DA, Chico.
[243:36.83]Keep an eye on him.
[243:38.25]We're gonna take a look around inside.
[243:41.37]Let's take a look.
[243:55.47]Shoe size.
[243:56.01]Are you going to the slammer?
[244:03.71]Is this going to be a furniture maze?
[244:07.26]It is, isn't it?
[244:10.65]Oh, I'm so happy to do the furniture maze.
[244:13.37]What would you do with all this stuff?
[244:14.45]No, it's not the wardrobe.
[244:19.68]What a pile of junk.
[244:40.66]my mother would be in heaven well the water is here I bet this is the kind of crap you love cole 20 years out of fashion am I crazy that was where the water was leaving people in here
[245:12.26]Is there water on the ground over here?
[245:26.79]I fucked it all up.
[245:29.13]I'm gonna get the- I just came in the- Who lives in a pineapple?
[245:38.19]Alright, I followed the water.
[245:40.12]What happened?
[245:42.79]Water this way.
[245:44.39]Water this way.
[245:46.57]Following water.
[246:01.23]What happened to the water?
[246:03.29]There it is.
[246:10.08]Is there water over here?
[246:11.02]There is not.
[246:12.06]There's water this way.
[246:12.94]This is where I ended up before.
[246:16.18]So the water just stops right here.
[246:20.74]So what the hell do I do?
[246:21.72]What do you mean, the front desk?
[246:41.11]Time to check Jose's books.
[246:42.93]See where he makes his delivery runs.
[246:44.81]Try the front desk.
[246:49.73]Hold on a second.
[246:51.39]Are you telling me to just go to the very beginning?
[246:53.81]See where he makes his delivery runs.
[246:55.79]Try the front desk.
[246:58.61]So there was no reason for me to go and follow the water trail to there?
[247:03.53]Is that what you're saying?
[247:25.29]Are you fucking serious?
[247:28.54]Where's he been delivering?
[247:29.76]And who's been delivering here?
[247:31.50]Any repeat business in the ledger, Cole?
[247:34.34]Okay.
[247:40.04]Uh, so I need to find... What am I looking for?
[247:42.61]Do I have to go... Number slip?
[248:14.53]Say something funny.
[248:17.47]Well, there's the thing everyone's saying.
[248:19.35]Nice finger.
[248:19.79]Well, here's the rest of this.
[249:16.91]Couldn't you think anywhere else to meet, kid?
[249:18.63]We like to choose our ground.
[249:20.23]What is that supposed to mean?
[249:21.05]This dude is in a lot of these.
[249:21.89]It's something Wellington said at Waterloo.
[249:23.75]The guys who win normally choose where to fight.
[249:25.71]We're gonna fight, kid?
[249:26.47]The two of you versus my boys here?
[249:28.95]I love the fight game.
[249:30.68]I went a few rounds myself.
[249:32.98]You and your friend, uh, he looks tough, but, uh, I don't like your chances.
[249:38.04]Nah.
[249:38.62]We don't have to fight, Mr. Cohen.
[249:40.96]We have you in Infolate.
[249:42.46]What the fuck is that?
[249:43.76]Some kind of steak?
[249:46.25]It means my men are in cover, but that they can still shoot you.
[249:52.99]If those were my orders, you would all be dead now.
[249:55.39]Are you kidding me?
[249:57.03]This is a $200 coat.
[249:59.34]You got some balls.
[250:00.04]Kelso.
[250:01.88]I hope you didn't scratch the paint of my new Lincoln.
[250:05.76]These guys are getting out of the dope business, Mr. Cohen.
[250:08.36]You'll have no more problems from them.
[250:12.36]The morphine is going to disappear back into the sea.
[250:14.78]Hang on.
[250:15.34]You're getting hasty.
[250:17.48]There's a lot of dough on offer here.
[250:18.88]Thanks for the offer, Mr. Cohen, but we are going to have to politely decline.
[250:22.54]After today, the morphine is no more.
[250:24.35]This isn't the way we normally do business.
[250:26.39]I'm aware of that, Mr. Cohen.
[250:28.09]Call me Mickey.
[250:30.01]Are you aware of the risk, huh?
[250:32.13]I'm giving it to you straight, Mr. Cohen.
[250:34.08]There will be no more morphine.
[250:36.53]We made a mistake and would like to back out gracefully.
[250:38.99]If you come after us, we will be forced to come after you.
[250:41.73]You've been polite up till now.
[250:43.58]So don't start making threats.
[250:44.48]Holy shit, big money.
[250:45.12]I don't make threats, Mr. Cohen.
[250:49.64]I'd like to thank you for your time.
[250:51.42]After this cutscene, I will graciously take a look.
[250:53.84]Is that guy your idea of muscle, kid?
[250:56.64]There's something you should know about Jack, Mr. Cohen.
[251:00.10]He killed six Japs hand to hand with just a bayonet and a K-bar knife.
[251:04.90]His outfit, the Six Marines, killed over 100,000 Japs in three months in Okinawa, and he was in the thick of it.
[251:12.08]Those Japs are little guys, right?
[251:14.74]Yes, Mr. Cohen.
[251:16.66]About your size.
[251:32.61]All right.
[251:43.43]We're loading?
[251:44.60]Oh.
[251:46.04]Okay.
[251:55.46]Newspapers!
[252:00.66]Alright.
[252:01.02]We don't need to do anything else here.
[252:02.08]Any more Red Dead Redemption?
[252:07.42]Red Dead Redemption?
[252:08.93]Yes.
[252:09.77]I'll probably be playing that again after this.
[252:11.87]This is the second LA Demar stream.
[252:21.18]But let me get to the... CookieCRM gave $50...
[252:25.95]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, Cookie.
[252:29.70]Cookie says, hey there, German.
[252:30.94]It's been a rough, tough few months for me.
[252:33.10]So it's nice to come and watch the stream.
[252:34.48]My crappy time got better, got the better of me.
[252:37.30]And I kind of acted like a jerk on your last stream in Boston.
[252:41.18]I made a few jokes about how your stream sucks after donating $115, but I don't think the joke went through well.
[252:47.58]I've felt awful about it ever since, so here's some more money to go with my apology, even if you feel it's not needed to enjoy a gift to kickstart your gambling addiction.
[252:59.71]I don't remember any mean comments or anything.
[253:09.35]but thank you for the $50 here, Cookie.
[253:13.81]Sorry to hear about your, that you're having a tough time.
[253:18.21]Hope it's better now.
[253:18.95]Hope you're having a better time.
[253:25.67]You were crying?
[253:26.47]I was really drinking.
[253:34.47]I was drinking heavily that stream.
[253:39.86]But anyways, thank you so much, dude.
[253:42.88]Don't worry about it.
[253:43.94]I don't really know.
[253:45.54]I don't really remember.
[253:48.82]But it's all good.
[253:51.95]All right.
[253:52.15]Is there anything else I need to do in here?
[253:59.65]I clicked on this because somebody said it.
[254:08.32]Merlinati is buying a lot of furniture.
[254:13.86]This stream sucks, by the way.
[254:17.27]Well... That's your opinion.
[254:20.89]I'm glad you have one.
[254:31.63]You'd be bad if you didn't.
[254:35.91]Alright, now follow Trail of Water.
[254:40.15]Oh, there's a trail of water here.
[254:41.41]Okay.
[254:59.10]Drink the water.
[255:12.23]Door or ladder?
[255:14.30]Ladder.
[255:15.04]Alright, uh... Phelps, I think it's time for you to join the American Ninja Warrior crew.
[255:34.27]Holy shit.
[255:45.25]Buttons.
[255:52.95]What is this for?
[256:14.03]Grab the guy.
[256:16.51]Can you?
[256:17.05]Can I like pick him up?
[256:25.59]Crush him.
[256:26.17]Crush him!
[256:28.25]Wait, did I just block myself?
[256:36.41]Did I just let him in?
[256:37.37]I think I have to pick that up again and move it.
[256:47.81]He was right there.
[256:49.09]He tried.
[257:00.98]He didn't block the door again.
[257:04.26]Alright.
[257:06.95]What are you... Uh... Some kind of shortcut?
[257:19.49]Or... what?
[257:22.60]Now block him in.
[257:35.20]No, I'm not jumping.
[257:38.13]I'm not restarting this mission.
[257:42.79]Yeah.
[257:52.66]Ugh, I'm not gonna make it.
[257:55.44]What I was gonna say was a mosquito or like a Jurassic Park fucking fossil, whatever.
[257:59.51]Uh... Okay.
[258:22.39]Giant Jenga!
[258:23.31]I've played this at a bar before.
[258:25.82]This must be how they transport the morphine.
[258:49.52]LAPD, leave it right there.
[258:51.56]Everyone out of the vehicle and put your hands up.
[258:54.64]There's something in the ice.
[258:56.90]He's making a run for it.
[258:58.24]There's something in the ice.
[259:02.28]Oh, get him!
[259:04.26]No, don't lose me in the furniture maze.
[259:06.08]I'm wide open here.
[259:07.18]Oh, fuck.
[259:08.61]Oh, no.
[259:11.97]Show me your face, motherfucker!
[259:24.72]He's dead.
[259:26.31]I think no, he's good.
[259:29.97]Take them all to Hollywood station.
[259:31.41]Have the ME and tech services go over this place.
[259:34.83]What will you be?
[259:35.91]Hunting polar bear.
[259:39.38]Polar golf.
[259:40.50]Polar bear ice golf.
[259:45.98]Is Adi serious?
[259:47.08]Is the LAPD turning a blind eye to narcotics?
[259:51.37]Keep your shirt on, Phelps.
[259:53.85]Drugs are prohibited.
[259:55.27]Doesn't mean people don't want to take them.
[259:57.24]Play it.
[259:57.74]Limiting supply doesn't mean that we have limited demand.
[260:02.02]I understand that.
[260:03.37]I know that the average Joe needs to unwind a little.
[260:05.29]A glandular switch?
[260:06.43]Or a V-switch?
[260:07.65]Heroin?
[260:10.99]It's important to demonize Hop, Phelps.
[260:13.00]Looks good in the papers.
[260:14.58]But when all is said and done, it's just another chemical like booze.
[260:18.18]A lot of people in high places think we're doing the city a favor by keeping the dope rolling into Central Avenue.
[260:24.07]Donnelly certainly believes we need to keep them anesthetized.
[260:28.63]Better jobs and opportunities would go a lot further.
[260:32.75]Will you listen to yourself?
[260:35.97]No!
[260:39.35]Sorry, I'm not doing it.
[260:41.07]I don't think so.
[260:42.57]Landmark.
[261:06.91]Oh, that's right.
[261:07.51]This is his car.
[261:10.55]Must have gotten fixed.
[261:11.39]I missed a turn.
[261:19.21]Oh, I didn't.
[261:25.48]You're paying for every last scratch!
[261:29.24]The factory is closed.
[261:37.36]Has been for years.
[261:39.32]How much call for ice anymore with all those new-fangled refrigerators?
[261:43.88]Save it for someone who wants to hear it.
[261:46.28]How many janitors carry a gat?
[261:48.16]That's one way of announcing we're here.
[261:56.34]Give it up, Finkelstein.
[261:57.75]Your brother-in-law will get you a good lawyer.
[261:59.57]My brother-in-law hates my guts.
[262:02.23]Come and get me if you want some daylight through that suit of yours.
[262:06.14]Well, that's three.
[262:07.20]I'm trying to just get him really quickly.
[262:33.29]DAMMIT!
[262:41.80]I don't know where he is.
[262:42.60]Who cares?
[262:45.44]What?
[262:51.58]Don't do it again.
[262:52.40]Don't do it again.
[262:54.22]Throw out the guns.
[262:57.14]That didn't hit him at all?
[263:01.11]That didn't hit him in the face?
[263:04.39]Ooh, you had a smart head there.
[263:13.54]Easy.
[263:13.78]Give me some cover!
[263:15.64]Push forward!
[263:36.30]They're all dead Finkelstein leave the weapon and put your hands up now.
[263:55.26]Oh
[263:56.49]It says press X to pick up weapon, but it doesn't actually mean it.
[264:02.03]You have to be standing on the weapon.
[264:15.98]Let's have a look around.
[264:16.96]Now that we've finally got some peace and quiet.
[264:19.89]I think I've had enough ice for one day.
[264:25.89]Until the scotch I pour myself as soon as we get out of here.
[264:30.71]Three guesses what's in the box.
[264:32.93]Open her up, Cole.
[264:34.49]It's gonna be drugs.
[264:36.03]There it is.
[264:37.83]This stuff has got to be worth at least a hundred grand.
[264:41.31]So Finkelstein robbed the ship?
[264:44.63]My guess is Lenny took it off their hands.
[264:47.87]This is big.
[264:49.73]This is going to make the papers, Phelps.
[264:52.13]As senior investigator, I'll do the talking.
[265:03.64]Biggest drug bust ever.
[265:05.60]Well, well.
[265:06.62]Who would have thought that Roy Earl's hand-picked new partner would have turned out to be such a great case man?
[265:12.81]This is a good result, Phelps.
[265:14.93]As far as we can tell, Lenny the Fink was moving the morphine across the city and as far north as Frisco.
[265:20.56]This makes the feds very happy, and it makes Mickey Cohen look bad.
[265:25.64]I won't lie to you, kid.
[265:27.78]I like the headlines.
[265:29.76]I like them a lot.
[265:31.88]You keep this squad in the papers, and we'll get along just fine.
[265:45.70]I did it.
[265:51.29]Case report.
[265:53.45]Not that great.
[265:54.43]But it's alright.
[266:00.48]The death of Lenny Finkelstein should keep administrative advice in the headlines for now.
[266:20.29]You know a Freddy Calhoun?
[266:22.99]Sure, I know Freddy.
[266:24.00]Freddy needs money to get out of town.
[266:26.74]Says he's prepared to blow us a little... No, I'm not clicking on it.
[266:29.80]It's a wild tangent game.
[266:32.42]As he said, how much it's gonna cost?
[266:33.88]50 bucks.
[266:34.66]And the department will front me the 50?
[266:36.36]You can put in an expense claim.
[266:40.06]He's over at Mike Lyman's on Hollywood Boulevard.
[266:42.18]See what you can find out.
[266:50.63]All right.
[266:51.65]I, unfortunately, looking at my phone a couple of times here, I have to make a few phone calls about important matters.
[267:07.40]I need to make two phone calls.
[267:11.30]So I have to go.
[267:15.00]Uh, don't worry, everything's fine.
[267:16.91]It's just about a couple of loose ends that need tying.
[267:27.13]So, I need to, um, I gotta skedaddle while it's still, uh, what time is it?
[267:35.79]It's still, it's still not even midnight.
[267:37.65]Oh yeah, I gotta make, I have to, I gotta go.
[267:39.90]Oh, I gotta go.
[267:40.52]I gotta get out of here.
[267:43.10]But I'll be live tomorrow.
[267:45.50]This should give us just enough time to go through the bits.
[267:50.76]Just make your calls and come back.
[267:52.56]That's not gonna happen.
[267:54.96]I'll probably be on the phone for like 30 or 40 minutes.
[267:57.23]And at that point, it's 12, 30, 1 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[268:01.79]Might as well just start again tomorrow.
[268:03.77]So the plan tomorrow is you'll see.
[268:06.49]Not the green screen.
[268:07.17]Green screen is Thursday.
[268:10.08]But I'm going to do something else tomorrow.
[268:18.59]Something that should be fun.
[268:22.79]Not Deltarune.
[268:25.47]No.
[268:26.39]Something else.
[268:28.21]Something else.
[268:30.83]A pumpkin carving?
[268:32.57]Nope.
[268:40.74]I have to make two phone calls.
[268:42.46]Each one is going to last probably 15 to 20 minutes each.
[268:46.08]Maybe more.
[268:48.90]So that's where the 40 plus minutes comes from.
[268:53.88]And at that point, it's going to be kind of too late to come back, I think, to start another stream.
[269:00.87]Yes, one of them is my mother.
[269:02.31]That's correct.
[269:06.75]You are correct.
[269:10.03]But thank you for sticking around.
[269:12.05]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[269:14.51]I'm going to start earlier tomorrow.
[269:16.77]Probably around like 4 or 5 p.m.
[269:21.38]Eastern.
[269:21.82]So like the typical time that I started yesterday, the day before.
[269:24.80]I had to do some stuff today, which is why I wasn't here until about 6.37 Eastern.
[269:32.90]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[269:35.58]Earlier for something else.
[269:38.87]Take care if you're leaving.
[269:39.65]See you tomorrow.
[269:41.48]And if you're still here, why don't we go ahead and do this?
[269:49.08]Let's go back to Lazy Luke.
[269:52.92]$10 from Lazy Luke.
[269:53.48]Thank you so much.
[269:55.66]No message, just $10.
[269:57.46]Appreciate it, dude.
[269:59.54]Kesh Wolf, thanks for the $10 as well.

[270:03.08]Jerma Hart, thank you.

[270:15.25]Thank you.

[270:40.06]Uh, thank you though.
[270:40.72]Thank you, InfiniteTheodorant.
[270:41.62]Thank you, DivUSP, for the three bucks.
[270:43.10]No message.
[270:43.56]Thank you, Div.
[270:45.76]Uh, a pepperoni.
[270:46.44]Thanks for the one dollar.
[270:47.18]This used to be a Maynay stream.
[270:50.62]Oh, that's an old one.
[270:55.05]That's an old... That's... That's old.
[270:58.39]That's Stardew Valley, man.
[271:01.81]I survived Jerma985's stream and all I got was this LA Snores stream.
[271:06.83]Well, you already survived the stream.
[271:09.54]So, you've survived the stream, and you got a stream.
[271:23.15]But, thank you.
[271:23.77]Thank you to, uh... Itrusa... Itrusgara, thanks for the $1.
[271:30.52]Do Thanksgiving stream.

[273:43.10]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[273:45.81]Garf is dropping in from the rafters.
[273:48.17]A flying slobberknocker to Charlie Cheesnip.
[273:51.17]So what's this?
[273:51.89]Odie comes up from the ropes.
[273:52.93]He's using his tongue twister on him.
[273:55.33]It's a Jim Davis tag team.
[273:57.41]I've never seen anything like it, folks.
[273:59.39]Glue Man doesn't look so good.
[274:00.53]Garf is relentless.
[274:01.86]Garf would never be allowed in the Rumble.
[274:05.96]I mean, well, he ever again, I mean.
[274:11.69]Garfield would just never be allowed ever again.
[274:20.38]He's too powerful.
[274:23.14]How much do you want to bet Jerma stops reading these bits midway through?
[274:28.72]He's right.
[274:29.76]You're right.
[274:30.40]You got me.
[274:31.76]Yeah.
[274:40.76]That's absolutely what just happened.
[274:43.38]How much you want to bet that I stop reading them halfway through?
[274:46.22]And chooses instead to go on a wild tangent about how many Garf bits there are.
[274:52.07]I just want to impress you, Father.
[274:56.59]Thank you.
[274:58.05]Thank you, Garfield.
[274:59.95]You did get me there.
[275:00.67]That was pretty good.
[275:02.73]Cookie gave the $50 earlier.
[275:04.75]Huge thank you to CookieCRM.
[275:08.63]Thank you for the astronomical amount of money.
[275:12.71]It means a lot.
[275:13.29]Thank you so much.
[275:13.89]Uh, actual... Dragon tears.
[275:20.87]Thank you.
[275:22.57]Hey, Germa, uh... Life's been dealing me a shithand lately.
[275:29.03]I've got hurt and got sent home.
[275:31.38]My grandpa just died.
[275:32.76]I just want to say that I finally watched your murder house video and laughed harder than I have in a long time.
[275:37.54]Thank you.
[275:38.96]I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[275:40.38]That's... Um...
[275:43.58]That sucks.
[275:46.44]But if you can get any joy or happiness or take your mind off something, I'm happy that you think that my shit's worth watching and worth putting on that kind of a pedestal up there.
[276:01.77]That's... I don't know what to say.
[276:03.89]Thank you.
[276:06.46]Sorry to hear about your loss.
[276:15.26]That's it for the bits Thank you so much everybody as always sorry for the kind of abrupt stream ending but I'm getting texts here and It's I need to make sure I can make these calls because I'm on Pacific time and I keep forgetting that It's not late for me, but it's late for everybody else.
[276:38.79]I
[276:41.85]Uh, and then right at the end, it's Surugara for the $1.
[276:45.00]Sims 4 is getting a first-person mode.
[276:47.03]Will you do another one with that?
[276:48.37]Another murder stream.
[276:51.49]I don't know, maybe.
[276:52.77]Probably not though, because that was like, I can't, I don't like going back and doing stuff that I already did.
[276:59.23]Because at some point, you know, it was so interesting and so funny to me that going and doing it again is like, we're doing it again!
[277:08.14]Remember the thing we did again?
[277:10.30]I don't know, I feel like I'd like to keep that preserved.
[277:18.70]But thank you.
[277:20.02]We'll see, I'll take a look.
[277:21.02]I'll take a look at that, you know, in quotes.
[277:25.88]Uh, thank you Dr. Clay at the end here for $5.
[277:28.42]Finally got a chance to join the stream in the beginning this time.
[277:31.17]With your new schedule, it's a little hard to join the stream live because I tend to be at work when you start.
[277:35.93]Thanks for the stream today.
[277:37.67]Yeah, I'll have a more clear schedule.
[277:40.19]Probably start after the green screen stream is when I'm gonna really hunger down here and get all that done.
[277:48.85]I would say but in my opinion the green screen stream is like the start of Here we go here comes more streams here comes like the stream shit these this last week or so I mean remember I The Internet's been all fucked up, and I've been moving and stuff so these last week or so of streams have just been Hey, I'm I'm here
[278:15.15]And I've had a lot of fun.
[278:15.88]Red Dead has been fucking a ton of fun.
[278:17.36]L.A.
[278:17.46]Noire has been a lot of fun, too.
[278:19.46]But I'm still trying to get back into the swing of things.
[278:21.94]And this week has been what that's been.
[278:30.49]But we'll see how it goes.
[278:34.01]Thank you, though.
[278:35.11]And let's do the credits.
[278:37.97]The credits are going to roll right now.
[278:40.05]Thank you, everybody, for your continued support.
[278:42.22]You guys are amazing.
[278:43.62]All the subs, old subs, new subs.
[278:46.81]And I will see you tomorrow.
[278:50.54]He's been moving for six months.
[278:52.66]Well, not really.
[278:54.36]I'm here now.
[278:57.66]He does the credits after the bits.
[278:59.04]Well, people have subscribed during the bits.
[279:03.57]Sometimes the bit readings can go an hour.
[279:07.53]Sometimes, you know, 20, 30, 40 minutes, hour, two hours.
[279:10.83]And, you know, people subscribe during that.
[279:13.46]So I figured I'd just do it after.
[279:18.05]Remember when bits were two hours?
[279:21.07]Uh... Well, also remember, another thing to keep in mind is... During my normal stream schedule, it would be, you know, four to six hours three times a week.
[279:30.94]Right?
[279:34.46]I've been streaming pretty much every single day for seven to ten hours a day.
[279:40.77]Why are the credits off to the side a little?
[279:44.59]Um... I didn't even know that.
[279:45.93]Thanks.
[279:52.13]That would mean more bits.
[279:53.53]Well, that... Whatever.
[279:58.39]That's fine.
[279:58.91]That's not... Streaming longer doesn't necessarily mean more, like, money from people giving bits.
[280:07.45]It just... Just kind of... You know, people give money, they give money.
[280:12.69]That's how I see it.
[280:13.53]I don't... I'm not putting, like, a quota of how much money and bits I have to receive per stream.
[280:19.30]That's just...
[280:25.83]You should play more old school games.
[280:27.15]Too many AAA titles recently.
[280:30.09]You mean Red Dead Redemption?
[280:31.13]Because that's the only one.
[280:37.20]I played Lethal League with Star and then L.A.
[280:38.98]Noire, which came out like seven years ago.
[280:45.01]That's all I've done since coming back.
[280:47.63]You know?
[280:55.45]It's still triple A. Well, I mean... Here's the thing, right?
[281:08.35]It's kind of like damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[281:11.33]So like Red Dead, I started Red Dead and I streamed Red Dead four times in a row.
[281:15.62]And if I stopped playing Red Dead completely, there's probably a lot of people here that'd be like, why won't you do, do you want to go do Red Dead again?
[281:24.17]Why are you leaving Red Dead?
[281:25.39]You know, go play something else and then three days go by, go back to Red Dead.
[281:30.29]It's trying to do a balance, you know.
[281:46.08]And plus, all these huge, you know, 5-10 year in the making games.
[281:51.72]Like, Red Dead Redemption 2, specifically, is more than 5-10 years in the making.
[281:58.63]So it's not like a typical... I don't really play that many AAA games to begin with.
[282:04.59]You know?
[282:05.35]Like... For the most part, I kind of just do whatever.
[282:15.60]But that's one of those titles that I would like to experience and play and have fun with everybody with.
[282:20.04]Because it's just... It's just the new Rockstar game that... It's just so... There's so much to do and so much to see.
[282:31.77]But I will see you all tomorrow.
[282:34.67]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[282:36.85]Make sure I didn't miss any bits of the very end here.
[282:38.53]I did not.
[282:43.89]So much to do, so much to see.
[282:48.26]It's almost like you cannot tie loose ends up at midnight.
[282:52.02]Yeah, I'm going to turn into a pumpkin.
[282:55.09]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[282:56.85]We're going to do something different.
[282:57.95]Don't worry.
[282:58.37]We're doing something different tomorrow.
[283:02.57]What is it, Otto?
[283:05.21]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[283:06.39]Have a good night.
[283:07.05]Goodbye.
[283:07.93]Take care.
