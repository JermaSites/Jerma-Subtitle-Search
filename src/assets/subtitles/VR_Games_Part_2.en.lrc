[00:01.17]Oh, hello again, everybody.
[00:03.17]Let me just make sure the audio's working.
[00:05.63]Is it?
[00:06.27]It is.
[00:06.97]Would you look at that?
[00:08.01]It's beautiful!
[00:10.76]Hey!
[00:13.82]Welcome to VR Day... 2.
[00:16.20]We did VR Day 1 yesterday.
[00:19.82]And we're gonna keep going.
[00:25.03]I've got some special treats for you.
[00:28.61]I'm gonna play SUPERHOT VR first.
[00:32.16]And then after that, I got all the Beat Saber mods.
[00:36.59]Sorry, this thing's like weighing my head down.
[00:38.65]Let me go like this.
[00:39.89]I got the Beat Saber mods, SUPERHOT VR, and then pertaining to time, we're going to see if I go back to budget cuts or not and how I feel.
[00:53.18]How do you feel?
[00:55.06]How are you doing today?
[00:58.59]SUPERHOT VR sounds crazy.
[01:00.49]It looks crazy.
[01:01.89]So I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:05.45]Oh, my legs sore.
[01:08.48]My whole body is sore.
[01:10.74]I did like a five straight hour Zumba workout yesterday.
[01:15.74]I haven't moved around that much in probably like five months.
[01:21.09]But let me tweet this out.
[01:22.23]I'll be here in two seconds.
[01:24.15]And we can get started.
[02:31.20]Okay, it's taking like 15... This tweet is still apparently sending the tweet.
[02:38.79]I don't know how.
[02:39.31]It's like, oh, we're still sending 0.2k of data.
[02:43.11]What?
[02:45.51]What the hell are you talking about?
[02:52.00]Is it there?
[02:52.50]Can you guys see my tweet?
[03:00.68]Oh, fuck.
[03:01.08]I just buffed it.
[03:01.58]I'm sorry.
[03:02.76]No, you can't.
[03:04.20]Uh, okay.
[03:04.68]Well, let me try that again.
[03:05.94]That's odd.
[03:13.41]Alright, I'll be right back again.
[03:36.47]I literally cannot send a tweet.
[03:39.51]It will not let me do it.
[03:42.41]Does Twitter have server problems or something?
[03:47.84]What is this bullshit?
[03:50.72]Did I get banned?
[03:54.70]Why would I get banned from Twitter?
[03:56.18]I write like... Stream starting now.
[04:00.09]Hey guys, sorry for the internet problem.
[04:01.75]Streams will happen tomorrow.
[04:05.90]Now what do you guys think about Starbucks lids?
[04:08.54]Why would I get banned?
[04:09.34]Alright, well fuck it, no tweet apparently.
[04:13.22]Cause like, Twitter sucks.
[04:19.41]Banned for spam?
[04:20.53]I, uh, I make a tweet like once every three days.
[04:23.53]Are you kidding me?
[04:27.52]How many people do you guys follow that put a goddamn tweet up every 30 minutes?
[04:35.96]But anyways, let's see how I look today.
[04:43.15]I came ready today.
[04:44.41]That's right.
[04:46.01]Active wear.
[04:48.63]I got active gear on.
[04:50.43]This is like a breathable shirt.
[04:54.03]What's with my autofocus?
[05:01.09]What is this piece of shit camera doing?
[05:06.58]What the fuck?
[05:09.56]Oh, that's right.
[05:10.14]Every time my computer turns back on, all the autofocus settings are on default.
[05:18.09]Who even made a goddamn computer?
[05:20.13]Like, seriously?
[05:20.73]That's better?
[05:25.60]Alright, we're good.
[05:27.78]Alright, so we're gonna play SUPERHOT VR right now.
[05:30.00]And by right now, I mean like right, like right now.
[05:36.07]Let me just get in.
[05:36.99]Hold on, let me take one more sip of wine.
[05:41.43]I actually, I also untangled the cord here.
[05:44.67]And boy, was that a pain in the ass.
[05:48.61]Get this off.
[05:52.85]Okay, I gotta like, I gotta like sign an agreement with Twitch.
[05:56.71]Not Twitch, with, what is that doing?
[05:58.81]No.
[06:00.27]Alright, I'm going in.
[06:02.77]See you guys soon.
[06:05.17]Yeah, because, you know, I'm not going to be able to see anybody.
[06:06.91]I'm not going to be able to... I can't see what you guys are writing, you know?
[06:09.23]That's, like, the worst part about it.
[06:10.27]Let me just get my tools here.
[06:14.30]The worst part about this is just not being able to... Oh, what's that?
[06:16.58]There you are.
[06:23.50]I fucking got that working, too!
[06:25.00]Alright, how do I say yes?
[06:33.19]Okay, how do I play the game?
[06:35.40]Super hot.
[06:38.92]Update.
[06:40.62]Why is it in a different language?
[06:43.68]Your game.
[06:44.48]Yeah, I'm in it, right?
[06:45.30]Yeah, I'm playing it, right?
[06:52.92]Whoa!
[06:55.44]Ooh, that's painful.
[06:57.70]That's so...
[07:00.01]That's so loud.
[07:00.83]Hold on.
[07:01.36]No, it's not.
[07:02.08]It's face loud.
[07:02.94]You know what I mean?
[07:05.06]It's really face loud.
[07:06.62]Just give me one second.
[07:12.46]I didn't put on my fucking headphones.
[07:17.96]Alright, what do they want me to do?
[07:18.82]Okay.
[07:28.07]Going back in.
[07:29.49]I gotta make sure I'm in the right spot.
[07:31.95]Wait, what about my latte?
[07:40.52]What?
[07:43.10]I can't even drink out of this.
[07:44.18]Fucking computers, man.
[07:45.10]If it's not a computer, it's a material object.
[08:09.56]It's really heavy.
[08:11.14]Like there's a shitload of liquid in here.
[08:16.44]Why can't I drink out of this?
[08:21.81]That was a good latte.
[08:23.29]Alright.
[08:23.67]Sounds good to me.
[08:24.93]I just put a little too much ice in it because, you know, you got to cool a latte down somehow.
[08:29.21]You can't just not.
[08:33.12]Alright.
[08:33.64]What's it want me to do with the latte?
[08:37.47]Thank God it shows your hands.
[08:38.63]What are you guys saying about me?
[08:45.35]Oh my God, you gotta read.
[08:50.26]It's hard for me to read.
[08:53.04]It's a little, it's, I, well, alright, here we go.
[08:56.80]I'm ready.
[08:58.08]Grab gun.
[09:08.39]I did it!
[09:09.81]Time moves when you move.
[09:11.75]Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[09:17.95]I completely forgot about this.
[09:19.43]This game was like, wild.
[09:23.81]What, did I even kill that guy?
[09:32.69]Time moves when you move, right?
[09:34.08]So shouldn't this be moving?
[09:37.61]Yes, that's right.
[09:38.55]Yes, I'm your surgeon.
[09:40.37]Just give me one moment here.
[09:41.39]I've got to make one incision.
[09:43.11]I'm 85.
[09:43.41]I've been doing this for a long time.
[09:45.01]Don't worry.
[09:45.69]What do I do?
[09:50.43]Why am I so small?
[09:53.32]Shouldn't I be taller than this?
[09:55.18]The lighthouses are not correct.
[09:56.94]I should not be... Can I not reach him?
[10:10.00]Oh, okay.
[10:32.90]Last round.
[10:35.87]Whose last round?
[10:36.85]My last round?
[10:39.71]What are they getting away from?
[10:45.15]Break your fucking head.
[10:46.88]What are you guys saying?
[10:48.60]Ooh, super hot.
[10:50.54]Ooh, I missed.
[10:56.47]If you missed it, fuck it, you know what to do.
[11:16.48]That's so cool.
[11:17.42]What an interesting... Now, thank you to VRJosh, by the way, for telling me how to do that.
[11:23.23]It was kind of hard.
[11:24.69]With a big white background, it's hard to see everything, but... Turn around and look out, there's someone else in the room.
[11:38.75]He's gonna shoot me, right?
[11:46.36]Oh, that's so weird.
[11:47.26]He's going to shoot me right in the head.
[11:52.98]Dude, imagine you had this.
[11:58.17]He's going to shoot me right in the head.
[11:59.41]Can I grab the gun?
[12:08.90]This is fun.
[12:09.60]Hey, how's the audio?
[12:10.72]Is the audio good?
[12:13.22]What do you guys think?
[12:21.16]Yeah, it's good.
[12:24.56]Looks good.
[12:29.58]Oh.
[12:34.30]Thank you.
[12:36.54]You can throw.
[12:37.22]This is going to be so fun.
[12:39.16]I can't wait to throw martini glasses at somebody.
[12:43.73]Straps.
[12:47.97]Straps.
[12:48.95]Straps.
[12:53.18]It's easy to forget because you get so immersed.
[12:55.98]These are my hands.
[12:59.53]It's easy to get immersed.
[13:04.53]Okay.
[13:05.37]We good?
[13:09.35]We're good.
[13:09.73]Alright, let's go.
[13:12.76]Hard catch.
[13:15.90]How do I... I should have probably paid attention to how to throw.
[13:28.32]How do I let it go?
[13:32.10]What?
[13:34.64]There it is, okay.
[13:37.51]I missed.
[13:37.85]Alright, come on down here.
[13:44.35]Oh.
[13:46.27]Okay, there it is.

[13:54.91]Super hot.
[13:59.65]That's so cool.
[14:00.25]Yeah, I feel like fucking laughing at me.
[14:03.99]Give it a try.
[14:07.63]What am I getting?
[14:22.76]I don't think so.
[14:23.84]Whoa, another gun.
[14:24.48]There's another gun there.
[14:25.28]Oops.
[14:28.50]No, I made it.
[14:30.66]Damn it.
[14:34.00]Oh, raise your hand.
[14:36.50]Like this?
[14:36.90]Is he gonna punch?
[15:03.27]Raise your hands.
[15:04.60]Did I get hit?
[15:07.26]Like, am I supposed to just block a punch here?
[15:11.48]Like, block.
[15:18.58]Nobody behind me, right?
[15:23.02]I think I got hit.
[15:23.82]Yeah, I must have gotten hit by somebody over here.
[15:26.24]Alright, flight is canceled.
[15:37.77]Whoa!
[15:44.20]Oh, my face!
[15:49.99]Would I have to do that all over again?
[16:17.85]How close am I to the fucking wall?
[16:27.74]Ah, fuck, get him!
[16:37.89]Ah!

[17:12.52]There's the gun.
[17:31.45]Time to pay.
[17:32.53]You guys gotta act quick and grab a gun first.
[17:43.44]Where, why are you?
[17:44.84]Super hot.
[17:47.84]Super hot.
[17:50.12]They come from all angles.
[17:51.30]They turn around.
[17:51.94]Oh, this is unbelievable.
[17:57.80]Are you ready to play?
[17:58.73]I think I am.
[17:59.89]I hope I am.
[18:03.23]Show your dedication.
[18:09.43]This is sick.
[18:10.09]It is.
[18:10.35]It really is.
[18:12.23]Show your dedication.
[18:14.66]Aim for the head, okay?
[18:20.30]Oh, I get it.
[18:32.64]Oh, God.

[18:54.44]There we go.

[18:58.35]Super hot disk beat.
[19:01.43]What's with these games and discs?
[19:02.63]I thought they were just bugs in my room.
[19:07.37]Disk B. Where am I in my room?
[19:14.42]Please put on your headset.
[19:15.78]It's on?
[19:18.80]Oh, you mean like this thing.
[19:21.16]Can I bring it down?
[19:21.88]It's on?
[19:31.91]How do I get it on?
[19:36.13]I wasn't... I didn't... What do we got?
[19:47.37]Out of the helicopter?
[19:48.13]No?
[19:48.45]Alright.
[19:50.21]Closing down.
[19:51.07]Okay, I got two machine guns.
[19:53.10]Let's get denominations here.

[20:00.35]We're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang.
[20:02.05]Here we go.
[20:02.45]That didn't really work.
[20:11.35]That's it, right?

[21:13.29]Oh, you're not gonna rob this bank!
[21:17.67]Emergency exit.
[21:23.46]Just making sure no one's behind me.
[21:25.84]Here we go, I've got a place to hide.

[22:20.90]Let's get him with this one.
[22:22.64]No, he dodged.
[22:23.22]Alright, we'll get you with this one, motherfucker.
[22:25.02]Right in the knee, oops.
[22:32.30]It's alright, we don't even need it.
[22:35.44]Oh my god.
[22:45.01]He's right behind me.
[22:46.37]Got that one.
[23:14.01]Okay, I'm done playing Nerf Funtime in the living room, Mom.
[23:21.97]My older brother's way better than me at Nerf.
[23:26.60]Oi!

[23:42.73]What?
[23:43.89]What?
[23:47.00]What happened?
[23:47.90]Right in the knee.
[23:53.98]Oh, it worked.
[23:56.98]What is this?
[24:05.55]Good.
[24:05.65]Alright, what happened here?
[24:10.03]Ah, yes, I got it.
[24:23.11]Holy shit!
[24:25.11]Okay, hold on.
[24:26.45]Guy in front.
[24:26.75]I gotta punch this guy.
[24:27.45]Guy with a gun somewhere?
[24:28.39]Right in the gut.
[24:30.13]Right in the gut.
[24:46.31]Watch that bullet!
[24:47.16]I can see it!
[24:51.70]Oh, come on!
[24:53.58]Come on, man!
[24:54.70]I don't even know where I am!
[25:12.50]Where am I?
[25:12.96]I need to fucking figure out where I am.
[25:28.78]God, I fucking miss you all.
[25:54.56]Who's left?
[25:55.06]Where?
[26:11.48]Yes!
[26:14.02]Same deal.
[26:14.48]Bingo.
[26:16.06]I'm ready.
[26:18.70]Okay, here we go.
[26:20.67]Right there.
[26:24.19]No, pick it up.
[26:26.67]No, god damn it.
[26:31.61]Who's gonna throw?
[26:32.75]I got a bullet over here.
[26:33.79]Ah!
[26:35.04]Ah!
[26:50.37]I'm gonna move really slow.
[26:52.20]I'm dead.
[26:57.56]Fucking god.
[27:01.78]Oh my god, this is fucking insanity.
[27:22.55]SQUEEZER!
[27:24.92]Oh, you hit me in the stomach!
[28:18.18]You can block bullets with your gun.
[28:49.10]Oh.
[29:24.81]Come on, get him.
[29:30.99]Oh, this one's fucking hard.
[29:32.06]I'm losing it.
[29:57.96]Alright, get slow, slow.
[30:16.21]Oh, God.
[30:17.21]Super hot.
[30:19.42]Super hot.
[30:22.56]Oh, man, I'm shaking.
[30:30.56]That was fucking intense.
[30:31.70]That was great.
[30:43.46]Bye-bye.
[30:47.82]What comes up?
[30:56.38]Oh, I didn't get them.
[31:03.01]You know, I gotta give you something.
[31:04.67]You gotta start working on your chest a little more.
[31:06.35]That's what I'm talking about, it's fragile!
[31:24.24]Make them pay.
[31:34.80]Who shot the gun?
[31:36.97]I heard a gunshot.
[31:37.73]I don't know where it came from.
[31:44.16]Oh my god.
[32:11.12]Let loose.
[32:13.44]I assume let loose means this.
[32:31.13]Let loose.
[32:31.77]There it is.
[32:33.79]Wait for it.
[32:38.15]Do I have a gun?
[32:38.63]I don't have a weapon.
[32:48.99]I don't have a gun.
[32:52.19]Chad, I don't have a gun.
[33:00.26]What?
[33:04.34]Did I lose it?
[33:08.20]Oh.
[33:11.72]That was supposed to happen, okay.
[33:17.10]Anything else change in the environment?
[33:21.46]Alright, hold on.
[33:24.61]Where am I?
[33:26.13]I gotta be careful.
[33:27.03]I gotta take like a step over here.
[33:29.39]Alright.
[33:31.69]Get it in there.
[33:32.19]Do I have to put the heli back on too?
[33:40.12]If I can fucking reach it, right?
[33:43.55]This is going to be fuel for so many fires made out of gasoline on this channel, I swear to God.
[33:59.22]Come on.
[34:24.82]Get away from me, please.
[34:28.37]Oh, whoa!
[34:58.69]Right in the head.
[34:59.27]Right in the leg.
[35:00.90]Yes.
[35:54.63]Get out of my fucking life!
[36:23.60]Oops, that only has two shots.
[36:27.36]Okay, get ready.
[36:31.04]Special delivery.
[36:32.72]Gun.
[36:33.76]Axe.
[36:43.23]I'm so bad.
[36:46.91]You know what, come on over here.
[36:49.05]I'll just do this all day.
[37:29.97]He's going for the balls.
[37:30.63]He's going to shoot me right in the nuts.
[37:50.54]Holy shit!
[37:51.78]In my face!
[38:04.98]Why'd I try to catch a knife?
[38:10.68]Beautiful, let's go.
[38:26.95]Give me that fucking thing.
[38:29.85]I ain't even messing around anymore, let's go.
[38:37.15]Okay, here we go.
[38:37.71]Bring it on, let's go, fast!
[38:47.21]Where's the wall?
[38:48.93]Guys, am I gonna back into the wall?
[38:50.31]I can't look at the thing.
[38:57.36]Motherfucker.
[39:10.41]Whoa, when you shoot.
[39:11.68]Oh, I had it.
[39:12.30]Fuck, when you shoot the gun right.
[39:13.76]God damn it.
[39:52.32]Oh, where am I?
[39:52.94]Where is this?
[39:54.94]Where is this?
[39:55.34]I don't know where this is.
[39:58.81]I'm running into something.
[40:01.99]Alright, I'm gonna do it old-fashioned way.
[40:04.61]Come on.
[40:18.96]Where am I?
[40:19.44]Fuck.
[40:22.43]I didn't hit a... I don't know how that happened, but it did.
[41:00.79]Damn it, what?
[41:01.76]Oh, come on.
[41:02.48]What, did it hit the wall?
[41:13.47]God damn it, I'm losing my...
[41:30.99]I missed.
[41:39.18]Alright, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[41:46.19]Slow, slow.
[42:05.39]Okay.
[42:09.21]Here we go.
[42:15.92]I gotta grab the gun and then block the bullets, I think.
[42:21.72]There's nothing else here.
[42:22.48]Okay, I just gotta dodge.
[42:24.40]Why did he walk that way?
[42:25.26]Okay, shh.
[42:32.52]Oh, no.
[42:33.48]Oh, no.
[42:34.26]What is this?
[42:35.90]What am I hitting?
[42:53.99]Oh, God!
[42:54.77]Ah!
[43:26.87]That was fucking wild.
[43:28.33]I think I bumped into the lighthouse again.
[43:34.12]It's so much worse when it's in your face in real life.
[43:36.98]Bam, bam.
[43:44.26]What do we got?
[43:48.26]Just one.
[43:48.70]There's a guy walking around here.
[43:58.34]I don't see anybody else.
[44:06.66]Last words.
[44:10.43]I don't see anything around me.
[44:11.29]How am I going to get out of this?
[44:24.63]Oh, I did it.
[44:27.71]Surprise, mother hacker.
[44:44.00]Oh, over and out.
[44:46.00]Couple people up top.
[44:46.84]Let's go with the easy stuff first.
[44:49.16]Bingo.
[44:49.96]Headshot.
[44:51.50]Headshot.
[44:53.34]And then let's get one more headshot.
[44:54.60]Just a good measure on this guy right here.
[44:58.64]You know, why don't we make it a quadruple headshot?
[45:00.93]I don't know what we're going for here.
[45:13.40]Super.
[45:14.82]Halt.
[45:15.70]Almost at him.
[45:16.42]Super.
[45:17.84]Halt.
[45:19.43]Triple headshot.
[45:20.33]Yeah, it's alright.
[45:27.69]calling his shots that would have been great okay what dodge this well I dodged it I did what you asked I think I'm getting close to the camera somebody behind me
[46:23.45]Is somebody else gonna open the door?
[46:24.95]Oops.
[46:29.17]Come to me.
[46:41.84]One of these days I'll get this right.
[46:43.06]Get out of the way.
[46:55.52]Butter hands.
[46:56.42]Yeah.
[47:01.27]Crash the party!
[47:09.45]What exploded his head?
[47:12.89]Did I shoot a bullet over there?
[47:14.77]And hit him in the face?
[47:15.56]I have no idea what's happening.
[47:21.26]Show your commitment.
[47:24.52]Look down.
[47:27.74]Oh boy, this is actually pretty... If you got A Fear of Heights, this is not a game that you'd want to be doing right now.
[47:33.03]You're going to hand it over to a friend of yours.
[47:38.41]I felt myself falling.
[47:43.27]I can feel it.
[47:46.68]Any more discs?
[47:53.58]Don't do it.
[47:54.38]Don't do it.
[47:58.96]Can I unmute now?
[48:00.12]What do you mean unmute?
[48:00.92]What are you talking about?
[48:04.66]Oh.
[48:08.90]Bodies are disposable.
[48:10.61]Mind is software.
[48:16.57]So, when I first heard this game, when they announced it, when they came out with it, I thought this was just a VR mode for the original game.
[48:26.35]I did not know that it was a completely made-from-the-ground-up VR experience, and it's fantastic so far.
[48:34.27]Don't worry, I got it.
[48:35.13]Okay, so we got... I can charge up my fists by holding.
[48:41.61]So I have to grip.
[48:52.09]I have to hold the grips down, too.
[49:01.05]I have, like, laser hands.
[49:03.57]Try again.
[49:03.99]Can I only do that once?
[49:16.26]I think I can only do that one time.
[49:18.59]I should have done it on this guy.
[49:19.53]It's all good.
[49:23.13]Again.
[49:24.21]Again.
[49:31.13]No, my little kid powers aren't working, my imaginary powers.
[49:49.66]Kid, I don't think it's gonna work.
[50:07.27]Come on, why is it not doing anything?
[50:09.41]Am I missing something here?
[50:19.50]Help me out here, what's going on?
[50:24.34]Triggers and grips, yeah.
[50:26.24]Triggers, grips.
[50:29.06]Triggers, grips.
[50:30.72]Do I have to get closer?
[50:43.93]Triggers.
[50:44.71]Grips.
[50:49.57]I'm not sure I can get much closer than this.
[50:52.23]I'm, like, out of the play zone right now.
[51:00.95]Uh, maybe something screwed up?
[51:03.33]Yeah, I'll help you here.
[51:06.12]What?
[51:12.48]Did I, like, charge...
[51:15.12]What the fuck is going on right now?
[51:17.29]Do I have to get shot in the hands?
[51:32.91]You have to dab to activate.
[51:44.78]Well, let's try it again.
[51:45.52]Mind blown.
[51:50.27]Try again.
[52:18.11]Throw the gun forward and catch it.
[52:21.32]Catch the bullets.
[52:22.34]I can't, like, throw them.
[52:48.68]It looks like I can do it, but I can't.
[52:56.24]Is it getting baited?
[53:21.22]Do I just have to... I think I just have to dodge.
[53:34.75]Because it... I can't go like closer at it.
[53:38.02]If I... I'll walk into the computer.
[53:42.06]Alright, okay.
[53:49.62]Throw the gun forward.
[53:57.68]Well, let's... Did I actually get hit by that?
[53:59.80]Why would I have known to throw the gun forward?
[54:09.20]Alright, come here.
[54:12.82]Give me the gun.
[54:18.20]Shoot it.
[54:18.62]Go on.
[54:18.90]Shoot me.
[54:20.48]Shoot me.
[54:20.84]Try it.
[54:31.71]I mean, who... This is the first time we've had an experience like this.
[54:36.02]Did I miss?
[54:46.76]God damn it, I fucking missed.
[54:50.17]Wait, again?
[54:52.79]What's it say?
[55:01.16]Hit me!
[55:01.46]I'm right here!
[55:03.72]Right in the face!
[55:05.15]Alright, I get it.
[55:14.42]It's Groundhog Day.
[55:15.66]I don't even care anymore about dying.
[55:29.98]I'm not even gonna shoot you.
[55:30.78]I'm gonna take the gun and punch you in the face.
[55:39.35]Yes, I am.
[55:44.45]Oh, watch out for the fucking wall.
[55:45.94]See, this is why it's so hard to do this shit.
[55:48.98]I need it in the other hand.
[55:50.14]I can't aim with my fucking left hand.
[55:58.96]That's right, throw this gun like down the street!
[56:05.33]Again?
[56:05.51]Again?
[56:05.67]Again!
[56:05.89]You're almost ready.
[56:29.78]Oh.
[56:31.44]Ooh, a nice hat.
[56:34.50]Oh, no, it's a dog bowl.
[56:39.62]Come on, let's go.
[56:40.04]Give me that fucking hammer.
[56:48.63]I wish I could keep the hammer.
[56:49.89]Shoot them.
[56:53.17]I don't think so.
[56:54.01]Alright, fine.
[57:05.08]Thought he was going to move to his left.
[57:11.50]Walk into it.
[57:12.32]Ah, you didn't walk into it.
[57:13.36]I'm trying to space invaders you, motherfucker.
[57:15.05]Let's go.
[57:15.47]Holy fuck.
[57:29.18]I got him.
[57:40.18]I figured that would've been cool.
[58:11.94]Give it to me.
[58:14.54]Come on.
[58:16.04]Okay, now where was I?
[58:16.84]Where did I go?
[58:17.84]Down there?
[58:20.78]Shit!
[58:30.50]Jesus Christ, did I go over the shotgun on the one?
[58:38.09]I turned skinny and didn't get hit by that.
[58:41.28]I went so skinny, you have no idea how skinny I just got.
[58:48.23]What about to go somewhere else, like that way?
[58:50.67]Down in there?
[58:52.21]I don't know where it's going to put me.
[58:59.77]It is in there.
[59:01.32]Okay.
[59:02.16]I don't even need to do that.
[59:09.80]Come on, you stopped at the fucking exact moment.
[59:13.80]Give me that, give me that, give me that fucking thing.
[59:24.46]Where am I?
[59:26.05]Hello?
[59:28.19]Alright, now I'm going up there, right?
[59:32.49]We'll try two of them, see if I can get it.
[59:42.12]Yeah.
[59:43.22]Not quite.
[59:46.53]Jesus Christ!
[59:47.39]That was fucking fast!
[59:48.88]Fucking fast!
[60:17.20]Is that not a gun?
[60:35.75]God damn it!
[60:54.74]It's like you have to move around so much.
[60:57.04]I have like the minimum of what you're allowed to have to play VR at a room scale.
[61:03.62]Locked in a goddamn box.
[61:09.92]It's my own damn fault.
[61:11.36]I wanted to be able to walk around in a circle.
[61:12.84]I don't have like a fucking 1300 square foot living room.
[61:21.37]I'm like trapped in a fucking ice cube tray.
[61:24.29]Alright, I'm fucking- I gotta slow down, I'm getting angry.
[61:39.58]That didn't hit him?
[61:47.37]Come on.
[61:49.57]I didn't throw it.
[62:13.63]What?
[62:14.85]How the fuck did I not hit him?
[62:15.91]I don't even have enough bolts in this thing, but let's fucking play with it.
[62:18.93]It's gone.
[62:25.72]Okay, back where I was.
[62:26.98]Let me get, like, situated so I don't have to walk into a fucking wall.
[62:29.54]Got it.
[62:38.65]But... But... Um...
[62:44.88]Okay, that way, I think, right?
[62:49.94]Doesn't matter.
[62:52.70]It was that way.
[62:59.51]Did I hit the wall?
[63:12.25]Holy fuck, that's gonna hit me in the head.
[63:14.34]Hit him!
[63:25.29]I got it right in the fucking face.
[63:33.96]Whew.
[63:35.04]Okay.
[63:36.98]Sure, I'll take it.
[64:04.71]Oh man, that's coming for me.
[64:09.51]Oh, that's wild.
[64:14.91]What the fuck was that?
[64:20.15]Okay.
[64:23.01]One more guy.
[64:52.50]Give me that gun.
[64:53.20]Come to me.
[64:53.72]Come to me, gun.
[64:54.80]Come to me, gun.
[64:56.07]Come to me, gun.
[64:57.73]Come on.
[64:58.07]I'm going to fall over.
[65:31.08]You what?
[65:36.08]This is so fucking fun.
[65:40.59]It is a workout though, I'll tell you.
[65:42.77]In my little fucking ice cube box.
[65:46.33]I don't know where the wall is.
[65:49.15]That's the fake wall.
[65:55.66]Oh, we got one guy here.
[65:57.16]Right in his face.
[66:03.12]careful.
[66:04.22]This like swinging shit.
[66:06.06]The walls are so wide I can't even see where the borders are.
[66:09.34]For instance, what the hell happened here?
[66:14.56]Where did I just go?
[66:28.83]Got him.
[66:31.87]Ah!
[66:36.91]I'm gonna fucking swing so hard down, it's gonna be bad!
[66:40.31]I'm so fucked up about it.
[66:51.06]That was a double knife throw.
[66:52.18]I liked it.
[66:53.00]Okay.
[66:53.94]Escape.
[67:11.78]Oh.
[67:19.85]Where am I, what am I escaping to?
[67:21.39]I don't understand.
[67:28.58]Where am I going?
[67:53.56]That's it.
[68:05.95]Ah!
[68:06.99]Got the knife.
[68:07.89]And that's it, I think.
[68:28.01]Shot the bullet out of the ear.
[68:31.37]Prove your worth.
[68:32.25]Breach the pyramid.
[68:39.04]Obey.
[68:44.44]This is one of those scenarios where I shouldn't have obeyed.
[69:00.11]Did I do the wrong thing?
[69:02.89]Oh, I may have.
[69:07.95]Yeah, I'll get it.
[69:08.63]This is the broken disk.
[69:12.50]Alright, we got a shoe.
[69:14.14]No, we don't.
[69:14.56]We don't have a shoe.
[69:22.96]Dance, dance, dance.
[69:36.54]This is going to be hard to do.
[69:45.27]Has he shot yet?
[70:02.38]Oh my god.
[70:13.66]Fuck.
[70:23.46]I can't even get over there.
[70:25.92]I'm just rolling around on the ground.
[70:29.80]He's going for the ground shot.
[70:31.94]What if I lifted my legs?
[70:32.90]Fuck.
[70:56.43]God, fuck you.
[70:57.65]Fucking damn it.
[70:58.83]Get over here!
[71:01.83]I just got shot right in the head immediately.
[71:03.51]Oh, my mouth!
[71:10.39]He shoots.
[71:11.35]Dodge this way.
[71:12.65]Punch him in the face.
[71:14.70]Okay, he blocks like three shots for me.
[71:16.48]I'm gonna stand in the corner over here.
[71:19.86]I'm gonna hit something.
[71:26.34]Let's move this way.
[71:36.62]Okay, just gotta get it.
[71:37.48]Jesus Christ!
[71:39.88]Dodge this.
[72:06.61]Dodged it.
[72:08.05]I Q-Balled that guy.
[72:27.59]No, no, no, don't use this yet.
[72:44.83]Oh yeah!
[72:46.92]Super.
[72:48.22]Kill it.
[72:49.66]Scout Scattergun.
[72:50.48]It really is, isn't it?
[72:51.24]You're right.
[72:53.14]It kind of is the Scout Scattergun, isn't it?
[72:56.52]Here we go.
[72:56.96]Double Knives.
[72:57.64]Let's go for it.
[73:00.60]Hello.
[73:02.61]Hello.
[73:04.13]Easy.
[73:04.41]Easy.
[73:22.07]Alright, we're getting away?
[73:39.33]What if I do like the beam thing?
[74:06.14]They gave me weapons everywhere.
[74:07.88]Intercept.
[74:08.40]I think I was supposed to do that.
[74:22.73]One guy right there.
[74:23.42]One guy over there.
[74:37.63]Oh, I'm in fucking trouble, Dad.
[74:39.03]Oi!
[74:39.45]Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai.
[75:06.72]He's gonna be right behind me, isn't he?
[75:21.53]Interfere.
[75:29.81]Shit in my fucking face, dude!
[75:32.02]No, no, no!
[75:43.38]Intensity level is like an eight or a nine.
[75:48.71]Meat cleaver time.
[75:50.57]Where am I?
[75:51.01]Okay, I think I'm in the right spot.
[75:53.77]I'm gonna go across.
[75:58.56]So down like this, down like that.
[76:01.88]Grab the other one, grab his head.
[76:06.50]Oh, this guy right there.
[76:07.20]You know how fucking cool that would've been?
[76:16.65]Not gonna fucking do that to me this time.
[76:54.80]Bingo.
[76:55.56]Oh, he got cocky.
[77:05.03]I got too cocky on that one.
[77:09.19]Too cocky, it's alright.
[77:10.45]Oh, what, he's showing him the way over here.
[77:17.86]Fuck you.
[77:34.44]Fuck.
[77:35.48]This is raining bullets.
[77:56.63]One shot, get it!
[77:58.91]Yes!
[78:01.41]Alright, this one's tough.
[78:17.80]Holy fuck!

[79:51.50]Tilt the camera so I can see you while you... I can't... Tilt the camera!
[79:58.16]I can't do that, like, in the middle of the game.
[80:01.76]You can see me down here.
[80:05.50]Okay.
[80:07.42]Destroy the pyramid.
[80:09.14]I'll give it a try.

[128:47.72]I might as well just do it, right?
[128:49.68]How long is it?
[128:50.28]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[128:51.64]Welcome to episode... Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[128:55.24]Welcome to episode one.
[128:57.06]This is not easy.
[128:59.19]The series where I play Minecraft.
[129:01.39]This is going to be a single-player Let's Play.
[129:04.11]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term...
[129:07.10]Pretty loosely, because I'm an idiot in this game.
[129:10.18]You're gonna see lots of fails, you're gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I hope.
[129:14.72]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[129:18.30]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[129:20.31]Let me get the sip.
[129:22.69]Ah, that's a good shot.
[129:25.61]Alright, so let's get this started.
[129:28.05]Create new world.
[129:30.21]World name is going to be...
[129:38.08]I can't
[130:13.76]I can't feel it.
[130:17.16]What?
[130:17.38]Where the hell am I?
[130:37.79]I spawned on top of a mountain top.
[130:39.63]Okay, hold on.
[130:40.63]Sound has to be lowered, definitely.
[130:42.39]Okay, lower that, lower that.
[130:46.34]Maybe a little lower.
[130:48.62]Sounds about right.
[130:50.34]I actually have to crouch.
[130:53.40]Alright, so apparently I spawned on top of a mountain.
[130:59.30]This is a good seed.
[131:00.52]What's that?
[131:01.68]We're going to explore it right now.
[131:02.78]Go!
[131:11.41]I'm best!
[131:11.85]I want to get down to that.
[131:12.59]That's the home right there.
[131:13.59]I want to live right there.
[131:14.49]No, I don't even have to explore.
[131:17.29]See if I can't do this.
[131:18.25]I got a whole lot.
[131:18.99]I got an idea.
[131:19.51]I got a plan.
[131:20.95]Kermit Rack, Episode 1.
[131:22.65]This is how we do it.
[131:24.92]You guys ready?
[131:26.18]I don't know if you guys are actually really ready.
[131:29.48]Here we go.
[131:31.08]We're going for a skydive here.
[131:36.72]Remember, if you hold shift, you don't fall off.
[131:39.40]That's something I didn't know when I used to live stream this game.
[131:43.88]You guys ready?
[131:44.98]I've only done Minecraft like three times in my life.
[131:48.28]All righty then.
[131:49.08]What the hell is that?
[131:53.19]Oh, it's an octopus.
[131:56.11]Look at this little quaint little place.
[132:00.13]I love it already.
[132:05.19]Fuck.
[132:05.35]I'm getting so stupid.
[132:35.41]I'm losing stamina.
[132:36.11]No, nobody got it.
[132:37.95]Nobody got it.
[132:39.37]Who cares?
[132:39.85]If somebody got like a drink.
[132:41.91]It's not easy.
[133:05.17]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of JermaCraft.
[133:10.77]It's not easy.
[133:12.01]This is gonna be a single player Let's Play.
[133:15.55]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[133:21.78]You're gonna see lots of fails.
[133:31.34]Oh my fucking god.
[133:36.15]I can do it on no fail mode?
[133:37.67]No, I don't even want to do that.
[133:44.66]It's like 19 minutes long.
[133:46.42]This is gonna be fucking hard too.
[133:49.72]God damn it, it comes there.
[133:50.94]This is expert.
[133:53.12]Not mislabeled as easy.
[135:54.60]See!
[135:54.86]That's a good song.
[136:00.38]Search.
[136:01.90]Do the rat song.
[136:02.86]Do the rat song.
[136:05.45]Play your dang what?
[136:07.85]Rat, rat, rat.

[202:55.08]It is Han Solo.
[202:57.00]No, it's not.
[202:57.70]Why the fuck would the hardest thing in the game be Han Solo?

[209:45.78]Does anybody else get this sweaty and disgusting when they play VR?
[209:50.26]Am I like the only streamer that like there's a whole body deteriorates?
[209:59.98]Okay.
[210:01.30]So give me one second.

[211:51.15]Alright.
[211:52.31]I apparently didn't install this game.
[211:54.03]I thought I did.
[211:55.19]So we got three minutes to just hang out.
[211:58.72]Which is good.
[211:59.12]This is a good enough time for me to relax for a minute.
[212:02.25]Alright, so let me tell you my first impressions.
[212:05.67]Super hot VR was phenomenal.
[212:10.05]Experience is only like an hour and a half or so, one to two hours long, which is, I mean, what you get is worth it, I think.
[212:15.19]There's a lot of replayability to try to get your scores better.
[212:19.69]Game was amazing.
[212:21.65]Beat Saber is just a new, better version of what Guitar Hero tried to do, like, years ago.
[212:28.46]You know what I mean?
[212:29.46]It gets you up, it gets you moving.
[212:30.90]You actually have to feel the beat with your hands.
[212:33.50]I mean, rock band and shit like that with the drums, that was cool.
[212:37.34]But you weren't, like, inside of the beat.
[212:43.80]He's got a receding hairline.
[212:45.20]What?
[212:47.16]I can't do the whole... Guys, I can't do the whole Shrek movie.
[212:52.07]If I do the whole Shrek movie, I'll be lucky if the stream... I'm gonna get, like, a... I'm gonna get a knock on my fucking door by, like, Twitch staff.
[213:01.37]Hey, man, like, don't fucking... Don't do that.
[213:03.37]Don't, like, just play random movie clips and full copyright songs.
[213:08.90]Alright, let me get ready.
[213:16.54]This should be back on like this.
[213:21.06]You just did?
[213:21.64]Oh, I know.
[213:25.68]This looks... I don't even care.
[213:27.78]You know, like, sometimes you give a shit about your appearance.
[213:30.40]When the webcam goes on, right?
[213:33.90]And I know the webcam's on.
[213:35.42]Usually, I'm a little self-conscious.
[213:37.08]You know, I want to make sure that I look okay.
[213:39.22]How's my face look?
[213:40.40]Do I look alright?
[213:41.24]Do I look okay?
[213:43.10]I don't care right now.
[213:44.06]And you can just tell.
[213:45.86]These images are going to come back to haunt me in, like, fucking two years.
[213:52.37]I don't even care.
[213:53.27]Like, I just don't.
[213:54.73]Typically, I'd be like, oh, hold on, before I turn the camera on, let me like, okay.
[214:00.63]Hey, guys.
[214:02.49]Hey, what's up?
[214:04.03]Hey.

[256:04.80]You're good.
[256:05.10]That's enough of that.
[256:06.04]But the game's going to be mad if I don't fill it up.
[256:08.84]I'm only allowed to put a certain amount of ice.
[256:10.34]It has to be full.
[256:12.44]I'm going to go with a vodka.
[256:14.57]Make sure it's good, high quality vodka.
[256:16.49]You want to fill it up about... I'd say the whole glass.
[256:24.37]Even if it's a little more, it's okay.
[256:29.93]And then what you want to do is you want to grab a lime.
[256:32.97]Stick a lime up on the end there.
[256:35.15]And what I like to do is I like to do a little splash of cranberry.
[256:40.57]Just to get it... There it is.
[256:42.95]And there you go.
[256:43.49]Get a napkin on there.

[256:55.94]The real one.
[256:56.46]First of all, get...
[257:05.07]About 40 milliliters.
[257:06.29]Grab yourself a soda can here.
[257:07.78]Snap it off.
[257:08.36]Bingo.
[257:08.90]Throw it up.
[257:13.28]Rest of the way.
[257:13.84]That's enough.
[257:14.72]Get it out of there.
[257:15.44]Grab the cranberry.
[257:16.26]Get it in there too.
[257:17.80]This is like a vodka soda cranberry.
[257:19.20]Grab a lime.
[257:21.36]A couple of them, actually.
[257:28.44]You can forego the lime if you want.
[257:30.24]Grab a straw.
[257:30.98]Finish it off with some crushed ice.
[257:35.64]There you go.
[257:37.30]Order up!
[258:00.93]Okay, I'm fine.
[258:02.95]Okay.
[258:03.27]Here's another one.
[258:05.95]You can impress some of your friends at a party if you do this one.
[258:08.39]First of all, you get a glass.
[259:06.10]And then you put a little bit of orange juice in there.
[259:11.66]Just enough to get it so you know when it gets sappy.
[259:14.40]Grab the squisher, squish it.
[259:15.82]Then you got a little orange puree in here.
[259:22.86]And then what you want to do is you want to go to the, do you have any milk?
[259:30.95]Just pretend this is, or you could use heavy cream too.
[259:34.31]Just pretend this is heavy cream.
[259:38.08]Put like 73 milliliters of heavy cream in there.
[259:40.03]That's when you want to get it shaken up.
[259:41.21]You want to Ster it a little.
[259:41.87]Okay.
[259:48.33]Now you want sugar syrup, which is right here.
[259:52.06]Just enough.
[259:55.32]Okay.
[259:55.72]Now you want crushed ice.
[259:59.44]It's important that it's the crushed ice because you're going to do something here.
[260:05.90]Get that full.
[260:07.12]That's pretty good.
[260:08.22]Now we're going to add a little bit of vodka.
[260:12.30]Just enough to the brim, about 30 milliliters.
[260:14.26]Ster it up again.
[260:20.51]So it gets all happy and all crushed up and all pureed.
[260:24.57]Grab yourself another little orange with a cherry just to get on there so it looks nice.
[260:30.69]And I like to do, usually you share this,
[260:45.30]Okay, well, forget about that.
[260:48.18]I call this one the orange creamsicle dream.
[260:53.71]Bon appetit.
[260:58.15]Just awful.
[261:02.11]This next one I'm gonna show ya.
[261:07.42]Get yourself a few glasses.
[261:10.68]Bingo.
[261:11.60]Little bit of cube dice in all of them.
[261:20.32]across all the glasses, this is important.
[261:23.58]I need some more glasses though.
[261:28.59]This one goes up here.
[261:29.59]Well, I guess I can't do that.
[261:36.15]Nevermind, we'll just line them up the way that I had it before.
[261:38.05]So I got the ice and all my vodka in all three of them.
[261:44.50]Okay, a little bit of Prosecco.
[261:51.15]Okay, then we top it off with some soda.
[261:58.19]Give it a little kick at the end.
[262:02.81]There's like five or six customers out here watching this, you know what I mean?
[262:08.07]So then you want to leave a little bit of room because nobody wants a full drink stuffed in their mouth.
[262:14.33]And then what you do after this is you stand back as the bartender, and this one is called
[262:21.22]the ball-throwing midway game that nobody can beat.
[262:25.94]You try to get... you gotta get right in the middle.
[262:28.49]It's kind of great, but... I don't think it worked.

[262:51.01]Alright, this next one is called Jerma ran out of stuff to do in the game.

[266:43.04]I got a question for you guys.
[266:45.20]Are we dropping frames, I think?
[266:46.80]A little bit.
[266:49.18]So, my question to you all is... Let's get that off the screen for a minute.
[266:57.81]Hey, it's me.
[267:06.15]Remember the person that said that they get really bad anxiety when I take this off?

[267:20.40]So.
[267:23.05]I am not going to be streaming for the next day or two.
[267:25.39]I'll be back.
[267:25.91]Because I did want to do three days in a row, and we did three days in a row here.
[267:31.99]And do you guys want me to come back with more VR, or do you want me to pivot away for a little while?
[267:36.98]What do you think?
[267:38.02]I still fucking love it.
[267:44.34]Yes, yes, more, more, more.

[267:52.27]I have a list.
[267:54.96]A very long one.
[268:02.89]Alright, so I'm gonna leave the room set up the way it is, but I'm gonna take like a couple days.
[268:06.87]I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[268:09.55]So I can't really, it's tomorrow afternoon.
[268:12.35]And then the day after that, I have some house stuff that I'd like to get done.
[268:16.33]So you won't see me for probably two days.
[268:18.61]I'll come back here and we'll do some more VR.
[268:22.73]But this is fucking a lot of fun.
[268:25.51]What a blast.
[268:27.07]I just wish I had the stamina to do it for more than like five hours.
[268:36.25]Ah, is it a... Dude, okay, I just... This is why you gotta take breaks in this space here.
[268:42.87]Look what just happened.
[268:44.07]I just tried to place my glass on my desk.
[268:47.98]And I, like, went too far and almost dropped it.
[268:50.20]This is why, like, you gotta spend some time in the real world.
[268:56.88]But I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[268:59.14]We're gonna pivot to the bits.
[269:00.70]Thanks for joining me.
[269:03.59]I've had a lot of fun the last few days.
[269:07.24]I just can only do it for so long before I have to go like take a shower.
[269:16.27]If you spend too long in VR, you're going to get stuck there.
[269:23.50]That's what happens when you practice throwing and breaking glasses.
[269:29.44]I was really throwing them too.
[269:31.22]I was really trying to throw those with weight behind them.
[269:37.73]SuperhotVR was incredible.
[269:39.56]Beat Saber, obviously a ton of fun.
[269:43.20]And we're gonna go to the bits.
[269:44.14]For those of you that are maybe new to the stream, I don't read bits during a stream or subs.
[269:51.63]We do like a bit reading segment where we wind down at the end.
[269:55.27]That's exactly what we're about to do right now.
[270:02.64]First time viewer here.
[270:06.95]But thanks again.
[270:09.31]If you want something, if you want to see something in VR, I highly recommend you go to the Discord and put 40 months from Leather Jacket.
[270:18.77]Oh my god.
[270:20.71]If you want some certain VR games, I know Gorn is on the list.
[270:24.40]That's like another one that I really want to play.
[270:25.76]There's like two or three others that I really want to play.
[270:28.68]But please go to the recommended channel.
[270:30.08]I'll look at them over the course of the next couple days.
[270:32.82]We'll see what we can do.
[270:36.76]But let's go back to earlier, about five hours ago.
[270:43.98]We had five dolls come in from Miss Melon Tea.
[270:46.78]Five bucks.
[270:48.52]Thank you so much, Miss Melon Tea.
[270:49.52]Hey, Jerma, I ordered the Night Sky shirt the minute it was announced.
[270:52.49]Still waiting for it to get here since I'm all the way in Australia.
[270:55.85]But I love the design so much I was inspired to remake it completely from scratch in pixel art.
[271:02.15]As well as adding a few extra stuff.
[271:04.47]Hope you both and chat like it.
[271:07.65]That's fucking awesome.
[271:09.05]Let's see.
[271:10.89]Oh, that's so... That is so cool.
[271:16.20]That's awesome.
[271:17.74]Unfortunately, Jerma Mercury is not on that shirt, and neither is Saturn, so you added those other planets.
[271:25.64]Those planets got voted off.
[271:29.53]Well, nicely done.
[271:31.79]Thank you.
[271:34.26]Like a get out of this still like in the program here I think I need to go like this.
[271:42.14]Okay, there we go I'm the best emote There we are now I can see But thank you for the five dollars as well
[272:00.46]Binary Man, thanks for five bucks, Binary Man.
[272:02.86]I'm honestly so sorry, Jerma.
[272:04.20]I really am.
[272:04.78]Please don't hate me for this.
[272:05.90]What do you mean, hate me for this?
[272:08.14]This is a video called The Pinnacle of Gamers.
[272:15.80]Let me get it on here.
[272:20.44]Oh, sorry.
[272:21.16]God damn it.
[272:22.00]I'm so close to the... The vibe is still over here.
[272:23.94]I just, like, probably blew out somebody's ears.
[272:25.32]I'm really sorry.
[272:29.59]That was like an explosion.
[272:31.29]Is this gonna play?
[272:41.97]Yeah, it will.
[272:44.56]Okay, here we go.
[272:47.12]This is called the Pinnacle of Gamers.
[273:09.84]Did you speed this up or was I actually doing that?
[273:13.62]GOD DAMN IT!
[273:14.28]What the fuck did you do that for?
[273:16.32]Oh my god!
[273:17.30]Oh, you dick.
[273:35.15]You dick.
[273:36.21]You fucking dick.
[273:38.75]Alright, I'm telling you, I like to play videos that people send me.
[273:42.33]But I'm gonna be real Frank with you here.
[273:47.69]Don't pee in the soup.
[273:49.35]Do not piss in the soup.
[273:54.28]Otherwise they're gonna have to get pre-screened.
[274:01.74]If you don't know what I'm talking about, if one guy pisses in the soup, nobody can eat it.
[274:06.70]Link the video?
[274:07.52]I'm not going to link that video.
[274:08.58]That's too loud.
[274:19.35]Who was that?
[274:19.69]It was Binary Man?
[274:20.51]I'm really sorry for this?
[274:22.36]Well, I'm really sorry for like the three-day ban you're about to get.
[274:41.55]Show no mercy.
[274:42.55]I can't show mercy on that one.
[274:45.61]You're not streaming until then.
[274:47.59]Yes, I am.
[274:48.19]I'm streaming on the third day.
[274:51.94]He's getting suspended from school before a vacation.
[274:55.84]Don't worry.
[275:00.80]Oh, but don't do that shit.
[275:02.54]Really?
[275:03.01]Come on.
[275:04.69]Don't make me have to fucking change that policy because you want to blow out everybody's eardrums.
[275:19.39]One guy.
[275:22.70]But anyways, thank you SoupOrSeal for the $2.50.
[275:26.08]I do that to you guys all the time, but mine's not intentional and they're never that loud.
[275:38.07]Anytime I accidentally blow out eardrums is because like a game setting is too high or I open up a game for the first time and it's loud.
[275:45.05]That was like, I'm gonna put it to red as loud as possible.
[275:58.20]Dad's not mad, he's disappointed.
[275:59.98]No, I'm good.
[276:02.50]I did like the video up until the last tenth of a second.
[276:08.44]But, thank you SuperSeal for the two bucks and fifty cents.
[276:10.78]Here's an MS Paint drawing of you as a coal miner.
[276:16.65]Jesus.
[276:20.73]I hope you like it.
[276:21.71]Thank you SuperSeal for the two fifty.
[276:28.16]God, that makes me look like a zombie from a Resident Evil game.
[276:33.10]I look fucking terrible.
[276:37.38]Look at that lower right corner.
[276:38.60]Look at that Resident Evil, I'm about to turn 45 year old man.
[276:49.29]Rude?
[276:49.83]No, I'm not talking about the drawing.
[276:51.13]I'm talking about me, my actual face.
[277:04.58]That's the cover of a horror novel.
[277:05.92]Yeah, that's like the scary stories.
[277:11.08]Oh my goodness.
[277:12.48]But that's... That's fucking awesome.
[277:17.31]Thank you for the fucking coal miner.
[277:19.33]I don't have my... Where are my eyes?
[277:25.50]Why do I have no eyes?
[277:30.66]But thank you.
[277:32.10]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[277:33.80]How's a nice chicken sandwich sound?
[277:36.39]Actually sounds pretty good.
[277:39.25]Sounds pretty good.
[277:42.63]Thank you for the $1.
[277:44.33]Thank you, Magellan, for the five community subs earlier.
[277:48.45]Beginning of the stream.
[277:49.11]Thank you so much.
[277:51.13]Hey, Divas, thanks for two bucks.
[277:53.05]Two bucks from Divas, that's it.
[277:54.77]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[277:57.23]Your aiming is impeccable as always, jermaJex.
[278:02.55]from SUPERHOT.
[278:04.43]I feel like it did okay.
[278:08.43]Once, maybe like after 45 minutes or so, I thought I was doing pretty good.
[278:11.95]I'm gonna check the chat link.
[278:24.76]Manhole cover.
[278:27.87]Vocal stream of rescue from Vegas sewer claims faulty room scale.
[278:32.67]Alright, I'm not going to lie.
[278:36.81]I thought the thing in the top left was a pizza or a waffle.
[278:42.51]And then I realized, wait, OK, that's a sewer cover.
[278:49.30]Oh, that's so great.
[278:52.95]But thank you, Frodeon, for the $2.50.
[278:54.45]Thank you, Nate, for the $1.00.
[278:56.67]Hey, Jerma, I saw an old Twitter post with your SEGA CD.
[278:59.57]It has a SEGA Genesis on the right.
[279:01.51]Do I still have it?
[279:04.25]I do not.
[279:05.92]I do not.
[279:09.66]Unfortunately, my SEGA CD and Genesis are both gone.
[279:13.80]But thank you.
[279:15.94]Thank you, Smashly, for the 10 community subs.
[279:21.50]10 coming in from Smash League.
[279:23.08]Thank you.
[279:25.50]That's a lot of subs to give.
[279:28.96]Uh, but... It's unfair.
[279:30.72]Talking about the SEGA... SEGA, was it?
[279:32.90]Not Dreamcast.
[279:33.92]The CD.
[279:34.46]I actually came across, like, three or four more SEGA CD games that I really want to play.
[279:39.70]And I'm so disappointed that I couldn't bring it with me in the move.
[279:43.12]I gave it away, and I don't have it anymore.
[279:45.68]And I'm like, I want to play the Cliffhanger game.
[279:52.55]I might have to get another one.
[279:56.95]But we'll see about that.
[279:59.33]Ask for it back?
[280:01.02]I can't ask for it back.
[280:06.96]Hey, thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $2.50.
[280:08.96]Where is my venti soy latte?
[280:12.96]Talking about my hair.
[280:16.71]Talking about my hair.
[280:20.17]Theo, Mighty Bob, thanks for the $2.00.
[280:23.75]BrodyMuppet, thanks for the $2.50.
[280:24.93]This stream has been amazing, man.
[280:27.77]I don't care if the VOD is deleted or muted.
[280:29.78]Hope you had a blast, because I sure as hell did.
[280:31.80]Rock on, sir.
[280:35.30]Yeah, as much as I... I mean, I only complained about how small my room was once.
[280:40.49]It was a very flash rage.
[280:42.89]It wasn't really that... I wasn't really angry.
[280:46.09]It's been a phenomenal experience so far.
[280:49.03]The VOD is going to get hit horribly, though.
[280:51.99]So, unfortunately, there's not much I can do about that.
[280:58.33]But thank you, Freudian.
[280:59.18]It was a blast.
[280:59.76]Hope you had a good time, too.
[281:02.50]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $2.45.
[281:03.78]Do all the single furries.
[281:10.07]I'm not going to play all the single furries on Beat Saber.
[281:16.44]Thank you, Nate, for the $1 and Bozak for the $1.
[281:20.54]Back to back here.
[281:22.86]It's a me channel theme.
[281:24.58]Too bad it was all shut down.
[281:26.64]That's true.
[281:28.14]That's very true.
[281:31.04]Hey, JelloX, thanks for the $2.50.
[281:32.95]Hey, Gerbo, going to Navy boot camp in two days.
[281:36.99]Thanks for all the entertainment.
[281:38.15]Hopefully I can catch the streams sometime soon.
[281:41.93]I wish you the best of luck.
[281:42.63]Good luck to you.
[281:50.00]Hopefully we can see you again real soon.
[281:52.50]Thank you so much for being around.
[281:57.14]Good luck.
[281:57.46]Yeah, hopefully we can see you again soon.
[282:11.81]And thank you so much for the $2.50.
[282:17.77]Uh, Bozak came in with another $3.
[282:20.25]They say, PogChamp.
[282:22.49]Jerma for Super Bowl halftime show 2020.
[282:24.35]Oh, because of sweet victory.
[282:30.39]Thank you so much for the three bucks, Bozak, and yeah.
[282:34.37]What did I get for a grade on that one?
[282:36.23]That one got hard.
[282:36.85]A lot of different, uh, angle changes in the middle.
[282:47.00]Thank you, Nate, again for two bucks.
[282:48.26]Sweet victory.
[282:48.92]Do you hate the NFL for what they did to SpongeBob?
[282:54.47]I mean, the halftime show is, it's unfortunate, but the halftime show usually is just, they just get like a bunch of actors to come show up in the front row and dance around and they do some songs.
[283:06.87]So, I mean, some Super Bowl halftime shows are really good.
[283:16.12]I mean, I guess if you bring in SpongeBob for three seconds, you can't even give him, like, ten?
[283:26.03]You can't even give SpongeBob, like, fifteen seconds?
[283:33.01]But, what can you do?
[283:34.35]Uh, I think there was, uh, probably the best Super Bowl halftime show, it was probably Bruno Mars.
[283:41.09]He did it, what, like, three or four years ago?
[283:44.55]He went fucking hard.
[283:47.30]He played, like, every instrument.
[283:51.90]It was very, very well done.
[283:55.37]Like, you can't have a Super Bowl halftime show ever again when Bruno Mars put on that show.
[284:02.47]Michael, yeah, Michael Jackson, too, from way back.
[284:04.37]Well, I'm talking, like, recently, the last, like, ten years.
[284:06.98]Last, like, five to ten years.
[284:10.70]Prince, yeah.
[284:13.34]It's really good Super Bowl halftime shows.
[284:19.47]Janet Jackson, oh yeah.
[284:26.28]But in very recent memory, I remember Bruno Mars was ridiculous.
[284:32.54]He was like singing and moving around and doing all these awesome choreography.
[284:35.87]And then he went and like sat down at a drum set and just played like a fucking whole drum solo and was singing still.
[284:41.73]It was like, how the hell are you this talented?
[284:44.53]How could you do that?
[284:51.61]It's great.
[284:52.87]But, uh, thank you, Gapsy, for this one.
[284:55.27]Hey, whoa, the $1.
[284:56.35]Uh, do the Pirate Spy song.
[284:58.91]I didn't catch it, unfortunately.
[285:04.44]He played Beat Saber.
[285:06.78]I did.
[285:09.92]90% of that show was lip-synced?
[285:11.28]Well, they, uh, here's something you guys need to understand about, um, songs, right?
[285:15.58]Here's the thing.
[285:16.76]Okay?
[285:16.94]I'm gonna show you something.
[285:18.92]The reason why they lip-sync...
[285:21.78]All those songs is because when you go like this, when you're like jumping and fucking throwing your hands everywhere and like kicking and shit.
[285:31.35]Okay, I'm going to make up a song here.
[285:32.99]It's going to be called like Let's Get To It, Let's Get With It, right?
[285:38.10]That's like the name of the song.
[285:39.80]And it's like bang, bang, like let's get to it, let's get with it.
[285:44.50]So I'm going to show you how hard that is to do while you're like fucking throwing your arms around and moving around.
[285:49.09]Let's get with it.
[285:50.43]Let's get to it.
[285:51.16]You can't.
[285:51.48]It's not impossible.
[285:53.06]You're like, you can't do it.
[285:58.20]So what they do is they just lip sync and they have like a thing go over.
[286:00.95]So it sounds like the song that you like that you've heard before.
[286:06.59]If you're like jumping and like swinging around, you're going to sound all fucked up.
[286:21.72]It's called vocal training?
[286:24.45]Beyonce does it?
[286:25.37]Alright, but like... Can you... Explain Broadway.
[286:38.17]Broadway is...
[286:49.79]They're all C in the world at like 0.96 speed.
[286:52.39]You know what I'm saying?
[286:55.31]For the rest of us.
[286:58.31]Alright, I'm wrong.
[286:58.95]I'll admit that I'm wrong.
[287:00.55]But I'm not, though, because it's hard.
[287:05.15]I'll admit that I'm wrong.
[287:06.75]That's okay.
[287:15.83]Sometimes you're wrong.
[287:18.37]but like 99.9999.9% of the time I'm right.
[287:24.00]I'll take one I said something wrong or incorrect out of 655,000 times that I've ever said anything correct.
[287:33.16]I would put my bet on that horse.
[287:43.31]First time he's ever been wrong.
[287:47.77]I wouldn't neither would I that's that's like a bet that you you'd get paid a shitload for me saying something correct but you'd be you'd be risking your money a lot that's a very high risk investment but thank you to I don't remember how that started oh right bozak for the three dollars
[288:17.36]Thank you... No, that was... What the hell?
[288:22.64]How did I get on that?
[288:23.42]I don't remember.
[288:25.24]But Freudian Weapon... Freudian Weapon was the one that gave $53.
[288:32.73]$53.50 from Freudian Weapon.
[288:34.35]I heard it, but I couldn't come out of the VR.
[288:37.51]I was stuck in there.
[288:39.65]But it was over $53.
[288:42.51]Thank you so much.
[288:43.23]They say, Hi, it's me again derailing your stream.
[288:46.57]You're such a delight to watch.
[288:47.90]Love all that you do.
[288:49.28]And you really do help brighten my day whenever I watch your streams or videos.
[288:52.76]So thanks so much for keeping me going.
[288:55.84]Thank you.
[288:57.06]Frodeon Weapon.
[288:58.56]You didn't derail the stream.
[288:59.86]I didn't really have a chance to see it.
[289:02.11]It's not derailing the stream, by the way.
[289:06.03]If somebody drops like 50, 100 fucking bucks, it's okay to, you know, I just want to make sure that I don't miss it because that's a lot of money.
[289:21.26]Oh, it's the Bruno Mars halftime show thing.
[289:23.70]Oh, okay.
[289:24.06]Right, right, right.
[289:26.22]Thank you, Freudian Weapon.
[289:27.38]Much love to you.
[289:27.90]Thank you for your huge amount of money.
[289:32.13]Purple Rose Tattoo, thanks for the five bucks.
[289:34.29]You should do an Etalyx teacher's Jerma how to play Civ stream.
[289:38.37]I would get bored out of my mind.
[289:41.11]I respect those games.
[289:44.69]Civilization...
[289:47.12]What a great franchise, right?
[289:49.71]I could never sit down and play those games.
[289:51.43]Ever.
[289:55.39]To me, it's a giant board game that lasts.
[290:01.85]They seem interesting.
[290:03.15]They're really cool for what they are.
[290:04.49]It's just not something that I would want to play.
[290:10.47]That's the kind of thing that I would watch over somebody's shoulder and say, Oh!
[290:15.58]Now what's going on over there?
[290:17.09]What's happening there?
[290:19.15]Oh, well, you see, I'm taking these troops and moving over here to this country, and I've got a diplomatic thing with that guy.
[290:25.07]So I've got to be careful.
[290:25.77]And she's coming back this way, and I've got to be diplomatic with her.
[290:28.25]And I've got my resources.
[290:29.29]I've got coal.
[290:30.91]I've got VR coal.
[290:31.85]I've got wood.
[290:33.43]And I'm just nodding my head, just pretending.
[290:35.97]Oh, yeah, no, no, that's cool.
[290:36.76]That's cool.
[290:37.78]Nice, nice.
[290:39.08]So I'm going to ask a question that is me pretending to understand what I just heard.
[290:46.56]So when you get 100 wood, can you turn that into something else?
[290:50.90]Or do you use that to build?
[290:52.49]I have no idea what I'm talking about.
[290:54.21]I don't give a shit.
[290:55.15]But I'm just pretending that I do know what I'm talking about.
[290:58.63]So who do you have selected for... I know that Gandhi's in the game.
[291:01.87]Is Gandhi in this game now?
[291:04.17]I'm pretending to know or understand what I'm watching?
[291:13.28]I do that to everyone.
[291:15.20]I only do that in specific cases where someone's playing Civilization.
[291:22.53]I'm out of water.
[291:23.89]And coffee.
[291:25.93]And that's a good thing because it's 9 p.m.
[291:29.55]Question marks at the end of everything you say.
[291:31.07]Yeah.
[291:32.77]Because then you can't be wrong.
[291:35.92]Nothing you say is stupid if you have a question mark at the end of your sentence.
[291:42.89]So does a thousand wood give you something?
[291:46.51]Oh, I see.
[291:46.95]So those troops over there are stronger than those troops that are next to them?
[291:53.29]You can never be wrong.
[291:56.32]And then the person loves that you just asked that question.
[292:00.08]And then they'll just talk for like four or five straight minutes.
[292:03.58]And you're having a pretend conversation with somebody.
[292:05.48]It's really easy.
[292:17.71]Global warming, what?
[292:22.73]My professor says every sentence like that.
[292:26.78]That's because your professor knows that he can never be wrong when he does that.
[292:31.68]If you want to challenge that professor, it's just like, I'm just posing the question.
[292:38.23]That's for you to answer and you to understand and for us to come together and get the question answered.
[292:49.59]Yoda.
[292:51.25]Now, but Civ is cool.
[292:52.79]Just not a fan of those kinds of games.
[292:54.99]I'm not a big strategy player.
[292:58.71]Never have been.
[292:59.85]Probably never will be.
[293:04.55]It's some type of currency thing.
[293:05.75]I'm not sure.
[293:06.27]Yeah, I use that really well.
[293:09.29]Hey, Future Gamer, thanks for the $1.
[293:11.40]Payday 2 VR has it so you can play with non-VR users.
[293:15.80]An interesting stream idea.
[293:19.36]Really?
[293:20.42]That person's probably such a burden.
[293:27.62]The person's probably so sloppy looking.
[293:34.37]Uh, but thank you to Future Gamer.
[293:37.03]Thank you, HaveGun, for the $2.50.
[293:40.87]Uh, Jerma, you think you're gonna take me out that easy, you scumbag?
[293:45.35]And then Star says, I've been waiting a long time for this.
[293:48.07]And I say, Jerma, and I say, come get it.
[293:52.29]And then Star says, my ride is going to whip your ass.
[293:56.08]I say, Jerma, in your dreams.
[293:59.60]What the hell is this?
[294:08.20]Come get me, you streamer.
[294:12.02]I don't know what that is, but thanks for the $2.50.
[294:14.36]There's a dialog here between me, Star, and Etalyx.
[294:23.19]Thank you, though.
[294:24.53]This looks so much fun.
[294:25.07]It is.
[294:38.10]I'm not going to pretend that that wasn't the last... That wasn't the most fun I've had in a long time.
[294:48.78]Just in a pure video game sense.
[294:52.46]Right?
[294:53.94]Well, I mean... Okay, Resident Evil 2 was amazing.
[294:59.54]It was a great experience, start to finish.
[295:02.82]And then you got super hot VR, Beat Saber, Spells and Sorcery, Blade and Sorcery, whatever.
[295:10.58]But man, if some of those experiences aren't the most interesting, intense, and fun things I've done in probably the last five years.
[295:26.68]Sorry if I am influencing a purchase.
[295:30.84]But it just is.
[295:33.70]You mean to tell me that was fake excitement playing Africa?
[295:37.60]No, that was just a chill stream.
[295:38.70]We were just chilling, taking pictures.
[295:41.36]I had an equally amount of fun time in that game.
[295:45.45]It just wasn't the best thing I've ever done.
[295:50.95]Will we see more Beat Saber?
[295:51.93]It was really fun to watch you play.
[295:55.63]I don't see why not.
[295:56.39]Maybe I could, like, kind of warm up with VR with Beat Saber and get a playlist or something.
[296:06.71]I'm not opposed to that.
[296:14.62]The next time I do VR, whether it's two days from now or so, but not sit there for like an hour and a half or two hours.
[296:22.30]I was in there for like an hour and a half.
[296:24.68]I would say probably warm up with it for like 30 minutes.
[296:30.96]I am into it.
[296:33.57]But thank you, Frodeon.
[296:35.35]Thank you, C4G, for the $2.50.
[296:37.29]Carly Rae Jepsen, or I will cry, will get it on the list.
[296:44.99]Here's the one unfortunate thing about doing Beat Saber all the time.
[296:48.77]All the VODs will just get ruined.
[296:52.63]And maybe that's something we should go out on, rather than start with.
[296:57.12]Because there's a possibility that it might kill the whole VOD.
[296:59.92]I don't know.
[297:05.05]I will have to look into that for real.
[297:09.40]Call?
[297:09.66]Who's crying?
[297:10.12]What are you talking about?
[297:11.84]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[297:14.38]But thanks for the $2.50.
[297:16.90]Hey, Renix, thanks for the $5.00.
[297:17.97]Do reptile theme from Mortal Kombat.
[297:25.01]He had his own theme?
[297:32.14]Did he?
[297:35.37]I didn't know about that.
[297:36.07]I would not be able to get the duct tape off.
[297:38.96]I would need some extra help there.
[298:03.61]But thank you, Frodeon Weapon, for the $2.50.
[298:05.77]Don't mind me, just contributing to my absolute favorite streamer.
[298:10.30]You stream to the highlight of my day, man.
[298:12.14]These past few have been an absolute blast.
[298:14.64]Thanks so much.
[298:17.14]I've had a lot of fun.
[298:20.01]Three days in a row.
[298:22.51]It's been great.
[298:25.05]And there's way more to look forward to, so we're going to be doing it again.
[298:29.21]Thank you, Frodeon.
[298:31.94]Uh, Slavik, thank you for the four dollars, Slavik God.
[298:36.00]And he says they're drunk boys.
[298:40.64]Drunk?
[298:41.16]I wasn't drunk.
[298:46.70]Maybe I was drunk in the head from being in the device for more than two or three hours.
[298:54.57]But thank you, Slavik, for the four dollars.
[298:57.03]Busterboy, thanks for $1.
[298:58.25]Hey Jerma, was just gonna let you know earlier today I was telling myself I hope you don't play Beat Saber, because I really wanted to see it and I had to work.
[299:05.06]But you did it anyways.
[299:06.32]Thanks.
[299:09.40]Well, I mean, I did say last night that my plan was to play it again today.
[299:16.37]So I'm sorry, but I did.
[299:19.85]Painted Potatoes, thanks for the $1.
[299:21.33]Poop.
[299:22.43]Okay.
[299:23.74]Uh, GTX 1080 Quad SLI.
[299:26.70]Thanks for the $2.50.
[299:27.70]Hey, Jerma, recently started watching you again.
[299:30.92]Let me tell you, I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
[299:33.97]The movie night was god tier and I can't wait for the next one.
[299:37.11]Also, you should play Pavlov VR next time you stream.
[299:40.67]That would be great.
[299:42.40]Also, could you say, um, say Nappy is epic.
[299:47.44]That would make his day.
[299:50.42]There you go.
[299:53.33]Thank you for the 250.
[299:58.13]Pavlov is Counter-Strike in VR.
[300:02.33]Oh, I would get stomped.
[300:03.53]I would get absolutely destroyed.
[300:11.69]I have a list, though, that I need to go through.
[300:16.39]From recommendations and things that I knew I wanted to play.
[300:22.40]I will play Vive as much as I need to to get what I want out of it, right?
[300:30.34]But thank you GTX 1080.
[300:32.26]Multitrip thanks to the 250.
[300:33.52]If you had to die with the Vive on, what VR game would you like to die inside?
[300:37.30]None of them.
[300:41.29]If you had to die in the Vive... I don't know, um... Revive the Human Simulator?
[300:50.93]It's a realistic, incredibly realistic being revived simulator.
[300:54.79]Maybe it'll bring me back.
[301:04.07]I love that game.
[301:04.79]No, maybe I'll play it.
[301:07.29]Hey Topac, thanks for the five dollars, Topac.
[301:10.05]I want to see Shito again.
[301:11.27]Show Shito.
[301:14.98]Shito is going to put the VR headset on next time.
[301:17.58]I have a blast.
[301:22.82]Shido is not dead.
[301:24.12]He's just sleeping for a long time.
[301:27.20]He'll be back.
[301:31.34]He's just in a closet somewhere.
[301:35.24]Hanging out.
[301:35.70]He likes to be in there.
[301:37.06]He likes to be in like a shoebox.
[301:39.88]He has a little bed in his shoebox.
[301:42.85]And he likes to be in there.
[301:53.75]Thank you Timmy Timtan for the $1.
[301:55.55]You're my comedy humor joke idol.
[301:58.51]Not just because you're funny, but because you're so genuine.
[302:00.97]If a scandal comes out and you kicked a homeless person once, I'll be crushed.
[302:05.62]Fuck you, Jeremy.
[302:06.54]Why did you do that?
[302:08.10]Why the fuck did you do that?
[302:09.92]I didn't do that.
[302:22.17]Uh, well, thank you for the $1.
[302:24.05]But I did not do the thing I'm being accused of.
[302:26.77]There you go.
[302:31.22]That's kind of fucked up.
[302:32.12]It is bad.
[302:32.58]It's really fucked up, actually.
[302:34.96]Good thing I didn't do it.
[302:47.10]But thank you.
[302:48.36]Hey, Zalasky, thanks for the $2.55.
[302:52.18]And we get the inevitable, uh, Jerma is bald, actually bald image.
[303:03.85]Thank you for the $2.55.
[303:14.32]Hey, Future Gamer, thanks for the $1.
[303:16.22]Not mine, they say.
[303:19.00]Oh, that's the... Yeah, we saw that one already.
[303:21.07]In the, uh... Under the man cover.
[303:23.81]Manhole?
[303:24.27]Whatever the hell it is.
[303:24.81]Hey, Convo Breaker, thanks for the $2.50.
[303:26.95]Hey, Jerma, love ya in a platonic way.
[303:30.51]Nothing creepy.
[303:31.79]I hope.
[303:32.73]Well, I hope so too.
[303:35.90]I hope.
[303:36.72]Anyways, you didn't tweet out the stream today, and I missed most of it because of that.
[303:39.54]Yeah, I don't know what the hell that was about.
[303:46.76]I tried to tweet twice, and it just wouldn't go through.
[303:49.62]So I'm sorry that if you usually go through Twitter to find out if I'm streaming, I tried twice.
[304:00.86]My Twitter account got banned for no reason.
[304:05.44]No, it's fine.
[304:06.40]It's probably just an internet thing.
[304:07.44]It's probably too far away from the Wi-Fi box or something, strangely enough.
[304:15.07]Love VR streams more than most, and now I'm gonna have to watch it later without being able to call you funny names like GeniusBoomer and GodGamer.
[304:22.60]As much as I like having a VOD to watch while you're gone, still makes me sad.
[304:26.62]Please keep tweeting consistently.
[304:28.62]Also, play Pyre.
[304:31.98]Yeah, I wish there was something I could do.
[304:33.66]I tried it twice.
[304:35.54]Five minutes apart.
[304:38.00]But I really appreciate it, ConvoBreaker.
[304:46.83]I got the Discord app.
[304:47.85]Yeah, if you're in the Discord, usually there's a ping, I think, right?
[304:51.61]When the stream goes live, usually the whole Discord gets a ping.
[304:57.97]So Twitter's probably less reliable than that.
[305:00.21]If you want total reliability, then you could join the Discord server and get a ping.
[305:09.34]Because Twitter's weird, because Twitter can just kind of... You get buried in a feed sometimes.
[305:14.74]But thank you.
[305:16.10]Snoozingcopter, thanks for the $1, so this is the last time I can give you 100 bits without my message not being read, huh?
[305:21.26]In honor, can we watch this video?
[305:24.24]Imagine someone walking in a field of flowers, falling off a tiny slope, and then keeps walking.
[305:31.61]Let's see.
[305:44.04]Is this the right video?
[305:47.06]What- why did you just link me?
[305:55.71]Oh, this is when like the kid falls off and rolls down the- That's the wrong video?
[306:08.66]Why is this one playing?
[306:13.38]There's the greatest voice crack in history.
[306:40.00]So we're supposed to imagine someone walking in a field of flowers and falling off a tiny slope, and then they just keep walking.
[306:46.24]Alright, now I get it.
[306:50.66]That's funny.
[306:53.40]Thank you, though, Snoozycopter.
[306:56.27]And yes, as of this stream, $2.50 is now the minimum.
[307:02.03]I put it in... I changed some of the information down in the info.
[307:07.05]So if anyone scrolls down, new viewers will be able to see it.
[307:10.33]As of today, $2.50 is the minimum.
[307:12.97]As of today.
[307:13.63]To be read.
[307:15.47]You can still give $0.10 or $0.25 if you want.
[307:17.67]That's fine.
[307:17.93]Don't worry about...
[307:22.44]you know oh wait hold on I can't even give bits if it's less than 250. no that's still available just to be read at the end is 250. end of a bit era greedy streamer greed now if you've been like if you've been here you know what I've talked about a lot over the last month or two
[307:50.14]first we raised it to one it used alright for the let me like hold on let me let me put up like a shield here let me in my defense I don't want it to get to a position where I don't read anything you say under five to ten dollars you know what I mean no I know you I know you're joking but I there are probably people that are probably actually annoyed by this
[308:15.92]But there are, you know, I don't do TTS.
[308:20.94]A ton of streamers that have similar view counts have like $3.50, $5 TTS that just pops up.
[308:29.33]I'm not ever going to do that.
[308:37.37]I'm not going to ever put it behind like $10 at the end of a stream.
[308:40.73]But this is, I do things sort of differently.
[308:44.16]We hang out at the end.
[308:47.68]Which is memeing.
[308:48.34]No, I know.
[308:49.04]I know.
[308:49.48]Trust me.
[308:49.74]I know like 98% of everybody.
[308:52.93]We've talked about it plenty of times.
[308:55.87]But if anyone is upset by this, which I'm sure there are, it's not, no, I just want, just give me more money.
[309:03.81]Please, I'll take some more money, please.
[309:06.34]That's not the intention.
[309:09.50]It's just to keep it efficient.
[309:11.96]That's all there is to it.
[309:17.56]Post-stream hangout is always fun.
[309:18.90]And I want to keep it like that.
[309:22.36]Because I never want to get to a point where I'm sitting here going, oh, let me look at the time.
[309:27.10]What time is it?
[309:27.66]Oh, it's been a while.
[309:28.40]Like three hours and the stream end.
[309:30.42]I want to keep, I still want to give attention to like every comment, every message that comes through.
[309:37.19]I don't just want to blow through them.
[309:38.51]I hope you understand.
[309:47.22]But it sounds like most of you do.
[309:51.50]And we're almost done with the bits here.
[309:52.56]Got a few more.
[309:56.63]Where are we?
[309:57.35]Where are we?
[309:58.01]Hey, Marsh Mila, thanks for the two bucks.
[310:00.71]You should play VR Minecraft.
[310:04.83]Does it exist?
[310:07.25]But no, that's just regular Minecraft, but... No, that wouldn't change very much.
[310:19.29]VR Minecraft it's really good unironically really that's maybe but that's really somewhere in the bottom of the list that's like the macaroni and cheese you get all the macaroni and cheese out of the pot and then you're just scraping the bottom of the pan and getting all the sticked on gross macaroni it's I mean I'm still gonna eat it but it's down there
[310:51.06]Hey, Bingo Sunshine, thanks for $5, Bingo Sunshine.
[310:54.72]Jerma, why didn't you search for the opening and ending themes from your favorite anime, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, in Beat Saber?
[311:00.54]There's some bangers in there, and you know it.
[311:04.46]Yeah, play it again.
[311:05.64]I like it.
[311:09.54]I think it's really fun.
[311:11.50]I'm definitely going to play it again.
[311:15.34]But thank you, Bingo Sunshine.
[311:17.26]And thank you for the suggestion.
[311:20.03]Hey Dragon Breath, thanks for the $1 Dragon Breath.
[311:22.95]I made a silly video last night of you in VR.
[311:25.00]It's not long and doesn't deafen you at the end.
[311:27.20]Hey, well that's good.
[311:33.88]Let's put it on here.
[311:35.55]This is called That's the Cutest Jerma I've Ever Seen.
[311:49.89]I don't understand, how do I move?
[311:53.09]That's the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[312:22.76]That link.
[312:23.34]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[312:28.92]That's fucking ridiculous.
[312:30.16]There you go.
[312:33.12]That was great, thank you.
[312:36.39]Oh.
[312:52.76]Thank you Topac for the $1.
[312:54.44]Are these bits?
[312:55.50]They are.
[312:56.98]Those are bits.
[313:01.38]Hey Skullgirl!
[313:02.40]Thank you for the $2.50.
[313:04.56]Jerma, thanks for playing my JermaCraft map, even though you suck at it.
[313:10.10]It was a pleasure, but I just downloaded Beat Saber yesterday.
[313:16.46]And I jumped into hard and expert only.
[313:20.83]I think in like the four hours I've played, I'm doing alright.
[313:24.61]Okay, I'm doing okay.
[313:25.95]I'm doing good enough to pass the exam.
[313:31.10]But no, that was hilarious.
[313:32.58]Thank you.
[313:39.08]Oh, yes.
[313:39.42]So where am I here?
[313:40.48]Got lost.
[313:43.04]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam for the $1.
[313:44.46]Damn, the Jerva Bucks inflation rate is crazy.
[313:48.87]Inflation rate?
[313:52.09]Thank you, Nate, for the $1.
[313:52.89]Could you say SEGA does what Nintendon't?
[313:57.19]No, but I was a Super Nintendo fan.
[313:58.83]I thought the Super Nintendo was king during that era.
[314:05.10]You got the, I mean, forget about blast processing from the SEGA Genesis.
[314:08.32]What about the sound quality?
[314:09.74]The sound system that was in the SNES?
[314:10.98]I mean, the Super Nintendo had really good sound and music.
[314:23.85]But thank you.
[314:24.29]Yeah, you're a friend, Quincy.
[314:25.53]Thanks for the $5.
[314:25.95]Hey, Jeremy, you should check out the Waltz of the Wizard.
[314:29.56]It's a free VR game.
[314:30.68]It has a lot of things to goof around with.
[314:32.24]I think you'd enjoy it.
[314:36.10]Waltz of the Wizard.
[314:39.44]Yeah, I'll play it.
[314:40.22]I'll play them all.
[314:41.50]I will play them all.
[314:43.67]There was a dinosaur island game.
[314:45.51]It's called like Island 359 or something.
[314:50.89]You have to survive on an island with dinosaurs?
[314:53.58]I want to play that.
[314:57.66]There's too many things to do.
[314:59.20]But yeah, hell yeah.
[315:02.10]And then Topac, thanks for the $2.50.
[315:03.22]Tons of people say this daily, but thanks for the awesome streams.
[315:07.95]Recently graduated and your streams helped me put me through engineering.
[315:11.53]No kidding.
[315:13.07]Always come back to VODs or otherwise just to chill and hang out.
[315:16.91]Take care.
[315:17.35]Get better soon.
[315:20.06]I'll get better soon.
[315:20.80]You're talking about the doctor's appointment.
[315:23.58]Well, the doctor's appointment is about an ongoing, annoying issue I've had to deal with for the last six to eight months.
[315:31.48]Nothing major.
[315:32.56]It's just for some reason.
[315:34.10]There's some weird stuff that I'm trying to figure out that's not major, but it's just annoying.
[315:42.53]I'm going tomorrow to figure it out.
[315:46.64]But yeah, thank you so much for the $2.50.
[315:49.52]And I'm happy that you have fun.
[315:54.00]And it's an honor that I helped in any way help you get through engineering.
[316:01.05]That's a smart cookie there.
[316:03.57]Thank you, Topec.
[316:06.19]And CDT, thanks for the $2.50.
[316:07.61]If you're worried about losing viewership during the after stream talk, why not just turn on facecam?
[316:12.96]It's all the people want.
[316:15.27]No, I don't care about losing people during the end.
[316:19.58]It was a question of a stream going on for, you know, five to eight hours and then it being late and we're just kind of hanging out at the end and it's like 2, 3, 4, 5 a.m.
[316:31.48]for a lot of people.
[316:32.24]It's like gets to be 11, 12, 1, 2 a.m.
[316:34.42]for me.
[316:36.58]It's just to streamline the process and make it more efficient.
[316:45.21]Yeah, the view count drop at the end of the stream doesn't bother me.
[316:50.51]I mean, maybe, okay, if I like really, really, really gave a shit about what my Twitch analytics page looks like, then I'd be like, oh, my average viewer count, my total average, I gotta get that up.
[317:04.24]No.
[317:08.12]That doesn't bother me at all.
[317:16.00]It bothers me.
[317:16.86]But thank you.
[317:24.83]It's clear that you care, Jeremy.
[317:26.17]You dropped Kenshi because of, like, Five Guys who didn't like it.
[317:29.84]Now, I'm going to call baloney on that one.
[317:33.16]You go watch that Kenshi VOD, and you go from the first stream to the second stream, and you tell me how many ResidentSleepers, you tell me how many people were like, do anything else.
[317:43.07]Oh, it was like, do anything else.
[317:45.15]Next, next, anything else.
[317:46.41]Five Guys?
[317:47.61]Add two zeros.
[317:50.69]It was more than Five Guys.
[318:00.42]Burgers and fries.
[318:02.84]Some people only know you as a Kenshi streamer.
[318:05.13]Yeah.
[318:05.33]Some people came to that stream and then never came to another one again.
[318:09.15]I'm just the Kenshi guy.
[318:15.11]It was maybe like a hundred people repeating the same thing.
[318:18.00]Have you guys heard of this Kenshi streamer?
[318:22.90]Yeah.
[318:23.36]What's his name?
[318:25.14]Jerma?
[318:25.94]Jerma985.
[318:31.32]I don't think I'll be going back, though.
[318:36.72]But, thank you to CDT for the $2.50.
[318:41.04]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.00.
[318:42.21]If you thought about playing Skyrim VR...
[318:45.58]All like the new games.
[318:47.30]All like the games that came out and then gave themselves VR after the fact.
[318:52.24]I'm not really interested in yet.
[318:54.67]I'd like to play the games that are VR from the ground up.
[318:58.99]That were made only to be played in VR.
[319:02.93]And then we can do like Doom in VR.
[319:07.53]Skyrim in VR.
[319:09.33]But I'd rather do the actual VR true experiences first.
[319:16.11]I don't really have an interest in playing Skyrim, so I don't know if putting my head inside of my character's face is enough to make me want to play it.
[319:32.80]But probably eventually.
[319:36.50]And CDT thanks for the dollar!
[319:38.61]Also, where is Otto's Adventure 3?
[319:40.97]That's why you moved to Vegas, right?
[319:45.69]Autonomous Adventure 3 is every day.
[319:47.45]We have an adventure every day.
[319:52.47]And then Nate dropped this photo of a PlayStation Super Nintendo.
[320:01.56]Thank you for the $1, Nate.
[320:02.46]Yeah, this is... Sony and Nintendo worked together for a long time.
[320:09.24]And then there was an issue, right?
[320:12.63]That made them split off and then Sony ended up doing their own thing.
[320:22.25]Where is, where is, where is?
[320:28.87]There's a penis in that picture.
[320:30.27]Don't fucking tell me that.
[320:32.41]No, there's not.
[320:34.85]Thank you for that photo.
[320:36.75]And here come the credits.
[320:40.37]Thank you to all the new subs, but not the old ones.
[320:43.50]It'll be scrolling up here in just a moment.
[320:50.50]The controller looks like the NES controller.
[320:51.85]Yeah, it does.
[320:59.60]You're setting sus for Wednesday.
[321:01.18]Yes, you are.
[321:05.02]Wednesday between 3 and 4 p.m.
[321:06.68]Pacific.
[321:07.46]I'll see you guys again with more VR.
[321:10.67]And we'll do the same thing.
[321:11.65]Maybe we'll do another, like, two or three days in a row of VR.
[321:15.69]I don't want to overdo it, though.
[321:18.05]I feel like four or five VR streams in a row might be worth taking a break.
[321:23.63]And instead of doing, like, three, four to five hour streams in a row, do, like, you know, something else.
[321:29.93]Because I do have plenty of other things to do.
[321:36.40]But we will definitely be back on Wednesday with more VR.
[321:40.32]I'm now going to be the VR streamer.
[321:44.42]I have, yeah, I got Space Channel 5 Part 1.
[321:47.55]I've got Seaman.
[321:49.17]We've got a couple of Dreamcast.
[321:50.09]I've got a ton of PlayStation 2.
[321:52.55]There's like some new games that came out as well.
[321:55.51]It might be worth playing Far Cry New Dawn for a stream just to fuck around in it and have some fun.
[322:04.86]Who knows?
[322:12.92]Fix the webcam setup for Wednesday?
[322:14.36]For a better angle?
[322:15.82]See, the issue with a better angle is... There's... Because I tried to get it as wide as I could for the room... I'm always going to be moving around and I can't see in real time where I am.
[322:27.93]So I'm always probably going to be in... Because look, sometimes I was just in the corner.
[322:32.47]Just sitting there staring at the wall and I didn't even know that I was over there.
[322:36.17]So I tried to get as good of a wide angle of me standing.
[322:41.26]Maybe I'll try to get it a little better for next time.
[322:43.64]Maybe I'll add... Maybe I'll make it bigger and try to make it... I don't think I can make the camera wider.
[322:53.21]Put cameras everywhere.
[323:03.99]What was the percentage of time that I was looking at the webcam versus looking over in a corner?
[323:14.15]Was it more than 50% of the time that I wasn't actually standing straight at the camera?
[323:23.18]Your back was turned a lot.
[323:24.74]80% you were off screen.
[323:34.15]You were halfway off the screen.
[323:35.77]Well, also when I go down to...
[323:45.02]You frequently ended up on the side of the room.
[323:53.26]I spent a lot of time on the floor.
[323:54.56]Yeah, I did.
[323:58.29]Do you ever watch your own VOD to see these things?
[324:00.11]No, I mean, not necessarily.
[324:02.43]I'll go back and just see what it looks like.
[324:04.21]Get a tracking camera?
[324:11.27]During bartender sim, you were half off the screen most of the time.
[324:17.16]You almost hit your door at least eight times.
[324:22.13]Ugh.
[324:27.35]At one point you were right in our face and kept bumping into the mic.
[324:35.87]Ugh.
[324:37.94]Pro, hold on, let me see this.
[324:39.36]Somebody's linked a clip.
[324:40.10]It's down.
[324:44.06]Yeah, I am, just like over in the corner.
[324:53.10]This is so stupid.
[324:54.55]It's just my room.
[325:01.23]Imagine they spin the drink.
[325:04.77]You make the whole drink.
[325:05.63]The guy's like, alright, let's do it.
[325:09.62]Oh, that's so funny.
[325:12.64]I wouldn't want to be in that room.
[325:15.02]You would be fucking dangerous in there.
[325:20.78]But, thank you all.
[325:21.82]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[325:26.37]We had two more bits come in right at the end here.
[325:29.71]Nate, for two bucks.
[325:31.21]Nintendo betrayed Sony by going to the rival Philips.
[325:36.41]Yeah, until Philips CD-I came out and it was abysmal.
[325:41.03]But thank you.
[325:41.49]Thank you, Commando, for the two bucks.
[325:43.49]Next time in the Laser Sword game you play, do Hadway What Is Love, please.
[325:48.63]Song suits you.
[325:52.53]We'll get a playlist.
[325:54.44]And then Topac right at the very end, $1, say BibleThump.
[325:57.74]Why?
[325:59.58]BibleThump.
[326:03.93]Mic abuse.
[326:04.55]Hold on, I want to see this.
[326:32.13]You just don't know.
[326:33.11]You have no idea.
[326:35.93]That could be a microphone.
[326:37.15]That could be a wall.
[326:37.93]That could be a window shade.
[326:39.55]Alright, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[326:46.26]Have a great rest of your night.
[326:49.28]Take care, guys.
[326:59.71]See you very soon.
[327:03.60]you
