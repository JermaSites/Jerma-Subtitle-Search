[00:04.36]Hello.
[00:08.40]I have returned.
[00:11.24]Let's see if this will stay on and if it will work.
[00:22.39]Meme incoming.
[00:24.17]No.
[00:30.99]Where's Otto?
[00:31.49]He's lying down.
[00:33.29]Downstairs.
[00:34.67]Just hanging out.
[00:36.17]I said hello to him.
[00:38.39]I said hi to him for you guys.
[00:40.79]As well.
[00:41.09]I said, hey, chat says hi.
[00:43.79]Wagged his tail a little bit.
[00:45.89]Gave him a pat.
[00:49.50]So I just tried to load up into a online just random deathmatch mission to see what happens.
[00:55.76]Oof.
[01:02.87]That's not good.
[01:19.63]Well...
[01:21.22]If it's having problems for people now, what the hell is going to happen when they open it up tomorrow or the next day to potentially 100% to 200% more people?
[01:30.40]I don't know.
[01:49.85]It's the GTA 5 launch all over again.
[02:00.17]Only 25% of those people will actually be able to play.
[02:06.24]Yeah, I don't think... I mean... Unless it's a regional thing.
[02:10.02]Those of you guys that are having problems, what region are you in?
[02:16.18]If you're seeing the same disconnect every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes thing, are you West Coast?
[02:22.59]Or does it even matter?
[02:34.31]West Elizabeth.
[02:35.17]Alright, well, I'm in.
[02:37.37]I'm currently in.
[02:39.98]And there are players here, right?
[02:44.62]There are.
[02:45.84]There are players.
[02:52.39]So this is... If the hat fits.
[03:01.40]It's right here.
[03:03.96]Let's see if I can get it to work.
[03:05.12]Let's see if I can play a mission.
[03:08.88]Just send me a shitty horse, that's fine.
[03:18.90]Never do it for free.
[03:21.54]Level 8 stamina.
[03:22.60]What's the highest stamina you can have?
[03:30.44]Go fast, go fast, go fast.
[03:31.54]The faster I've gone, the... Actually, the more I've been able to connect.
[03:35.38]Hyenas.
[03:41.48]Watch out.
[03:44.67]This, uh, yes, this is online.
[03:46.79]We are now in online.
[03:48.13]How long we will be here is the real question.
[04:01.24]Howdy.
[04:03.34]Start matchmaking.
[04:05.58]Get us in the game.
[04:13.90]If this horse goes under 45 miles per hour, we're all dead.
[04:23.00]When do you get the ability to sell pelts?
[04:28.21]Look at that character.
[04:36.85]Okay, game details.
[04:37.69]Let's go.
[04:39.17]So, we... We're gonna try to take this guy alive as a crew here?
[04:41.21]Make the character a skeleton.
[05:06.25]I don't think you can.
[05:07.35]They're gonna fire me.
[05:09.38]Oh, you'll get to keep your job, but they'll fire me, and they've got every right to fire me, because I'm the idiot who employed you.
[05:18.50]Oh, look.
[05:19.84]Guests.
[05:21.50]Skip, one out of three.
[05:22.33]You're a moron, partner.
[05:23.93]Huh?
[05:25.29]Well, you can't be any worse than us, because this idiot...
[05:30.83]this idiot right here just let the most notorious con man in the whole goddamn state walk clean out of a cell clean out and not a shot fired now uh you get him back for us we'll happily pay you are you with the same players earlier I don't think so about that it would be very odd
[05:55.14]We got two out of three skips.
[05:59.10]It's almost over.
[05:59.56]Well, I just didn't skip in the very beginning, but... If you're gonna sit through the movie, you're gonna get up right before the big reveal happens.
[06:27.19]Alright, go to camp.
[06:29.05]Oh, I took... We're taking all the wrong horses.
[06:33.65]Nice musical chairs.
[06:35.33]Alright, we're good.
[06:43.84]We got two lives.
[06:45.60]Track this guy down.
[06:51.67]Watch it.
[06:52.17]Easy, easy!
[06:58.81]A gang is protecting the outlaw.
[07:00.19]Take him out.
[07:07.71]Sorry.
[07:08.65]Sorry.
[07:20.24]Explosion.
[07:20.64]Watch this.
[07:21.06]Ready?
[07:35.10]Alright, uh... Okay, we've got more left.
[07:42.92]Little guy.
[07:46.81]Have I been shooting the rock the whole time?
[07:48.13]Somebody's coming up.
[07:52.21]Hold him there!
[07:58.94]Just shoot the fucking rock!
[08:03.38]I'm gonna get low score.
[08:04.42]No, I'm not.
[08:05.36]Go get the outlaw.
[08:20.35]No, don't stop!
[08:21.91]Don't lose all of our lives!
[08:29.48]Okay.
[08:30.62]Let's leave this up to you.
[08:34.36]You just go get the outlaw.
[08:38.26]What are you doing?
[08:40.40]Where's the outlaw?
[08:43.96]Okay, we're... This is so stupid.
[08:59.98]This is not how this is supposed to be done.
[09:05.99]Hogtie the outlaw.
[09:10.27]How are we gonna get him back up?
[09:15.98]Anybody have a horse?
[09:25.38]Okay, let's go.
[09:25.98]Deliver the outlaw.
[09:27.60]In one piece.
[09:35.06]What just happened?
[09:39.07]Oh, no.
[09:43.40]Oh, this is not good.
[09:44.54]Alright, you guys gotta protect me.
[09:46.26]Protect me!
[09:47.52]Protect me!
[09:48.20]I'm the guy with the outlaw on my back!
[09:51.80]Alright, we can't die.
[10:00.32]Dying is bad.
[10:00.94]Uh, up there?
[10:07.24]On the cliff too?
[10:09.70]I think we have to just, we have to get out of here.
[10:11.62]We have to leave.
[10:16.12]That's it, right?
[10:17.94]No, I need a horse.
[10:25.24]Alright, I'll take care of the outlaw.
[10:32.71]You guys just keep me... You're on my horse.
[10:35.18]That's my horse!
[10:42.44]I love just how all over the place this happens.
[10:45.12]Every time.
[10:47.36]Alright, let's go.
[10:50.15]Just have to deliver him and he's gonna be alive.
[10:52.23]We're gonna get a good bounty for it.
[10:58.57]There's a watch.
[10:59.57]Yep.
[11:00.09]I knew it was gonna happen.
[11:04.48]What just happened?
[11:05.20]You can't whistle for your horse right now.
[11:13.98]Gotta get left.
[11:23.23]Horse, get over here!
[11:29.39]Oh no, no, no, no, no!
[11:30.17]He's gonna die!
[11:32.23]Get him up!
[11:35.42]Revive him before we lose.
[11:37.96]Okay, there we go.
[11:43.93]Epic teamwork.
[11:45.77]Alright, we good?
[12:06.26]Good guy, Jerma.
[12:07.49]Oh, what you mean to say is.
[12:09.19]Team lives won.
[12:15.97]More explosions.
[12:16.93]Explor- Explarsions.
[12:21.24]Now this mission's been fun.
[12:30.30]This is a cool one.
[12:36.30]I can totally see me doing with like Star, you know what I mean?
[12:41.87]Vitalik.
[12:43.93]Vinny.
[12:49.21]Yeah, once this is more stable, this would be fun to have like three or four people.
[13:02.58]I would definitely do this again.
[13:07.45]Instead of being like a QA tester, I'd like to get into it.
[13:14.13]Who are the current teammates?
[13:15.05]Uh, yeah, just a couple of other YouTubers.
[13:19.22]You know?
[13:25.74]Ow.
[13:29.12]Come on, I gotta hit the explosion.
[13:39.51]See off the gang.
[13:40.99]See off.
[13:41.45]That's it.
[13:42.11]Alright, we need a horse.
[13:43.53]Drop the outlaw by the camp.
[13:48.05]Why are we doing it like this?
[14:08.46]Let me go.
[14:09.58]Let me go.
[14:10.22]I've got money.
[14:11.56]I've got a lot of money.
[14:13.58]And I'll pay.
[14:14.08]I'll pay a lot.
[14:15.78]Hey, here's an idea.
[14:17.24]Take my hat.
[14:18.78]Put it on the dead guy over there.
[14:20.60]You take him in as me.
[14:22.49]I go free.
[14:23.33]And you get rich.
[14:24.59]Oh, and I won't kill anybody else.
[14:27.31]I swear.
[14:28.85]I'm reformed.
[14:30.31]I'm a changed man.
[14:31.67]I'm better.
[14:32.87]Please.
[14:33.79]Please.
[14:34.69]I'm begging you.
[14:35.31]Set me free.
[14:36.53]Have a heart.
[14:37.07]Do we have to vote on this?
[14:42.58]Refuse offer.
[14:43.40]Oh my god, take off or let the timer expire refute.
[14:48.93]I got it.
[14:49.25]I got majority Majority I really would like his hat Shawn's back
[15:13.81]It's a pretty ugly hat anyways.
[15:14.96]Yeah, it is.
[15:15.86]It is a really ugly hat.
[15:25.12]But is the material it's made out of expensive?
[15:27.99]It could very well be.
[15:29.87]I probably shouldn't do that again.
[15:46.98]Don't stop in front of me!
[15:52.20]I didn't even escape from that jail.
[15:54.64]I was released by the deputy.
[15:56.26]Did she just fall off?
[15:58.60]I'm an unfortunate victim of circumstance.
[16:02.72]And now I'm a victim of some self-righteous idiots, too.
[16:06.80]It's not particularly fair.
[16:09.22]Grandma got DC'd.
[16:11.60]But they never keep me very long.
[16:14.02]Take that as a threat if you want to.
[16:28.27]Excuse me.
[16:34.59]Feed the hook.
[16:35.01]Yeah, this guy does look really good.
[16:40.20]It is a gorgeous guy.
[16:51.69]Right into a rock.
[16:53.07]Not after how long that took.
[16:56.36]Take him in.
[17:15.56]I could've just jumped to horse.
[17:17.62]Seven dollars!
[17:18.32]Seven dollars.
[17:19.48]That's enough for me to, uh, take a ride to Blackwater.
[17:23.50]I made the money back that I wasted on the horse, yeah?
[17:28.04]I did.
[17:51.04]Free hat?
[17:52.56]No, we didn't get the hat.
[17:53.28]You get the hat if you let him live.
[17:55.54]No, you don't turn him in.
[18:07.29]Hey, I got to play Red Dead Online for 30 minutes.
[18:11.74]And we're still here.
[18:25.51]Yeah, don't jinx it.
[18:28.73]We'll see if it happens.
[18:32.74]No, we're still here.
[18:34.86]Visit each sheriff to continue your work for Horley.
[18:38.86]Alright.
[18:39.04]What was that?
[18:53.26]Snake?
[18:56.21]Whoa, that's a perfect rattlesnake.
[19:09.42]How do I not destroy the meat here?
[19:27.67]Whatever.
[19:39.24]Once was good, I was scared.
[19:40.48]Alright, it costs money to just be alive in this game.
[19:54.43]Who's this person hiding the cactuses?
[20:12.18]Don't mind me, I'm just... existing.
[20:33.53]Can I let you interact with him?
[20:45.39]I just disconnected him.
[20:47.55]Oh no, I just made that guy DC.
[20:53.59]Right now he's probably sitting in his room.
[20:56.34]What the fuck?
[20:57.18]I just DC'd again!
[20:59.74]Why?
[21:00.20]What happened?
[21:01.60]God damn it.
[21:04.90]Who the hell is that?
[21:13.20]He's back.
[21:20.63]No, it's not.
[21:20.93]It's a different guy.
[21:24.39]How long do they stay like this for?
[21:29.97]Hold on.
[21:30.87]This guy is just... I just have this guy.
[21:35.85]I've fucking DC'd him too.
[21:43.69]Oh, just the fucking serial disconnector.
[21:59.60]There's somebody else over here now.
[22:02.44]There he is.
[22:03.10]What?
[22:03.36]Hold on a second.
[22:28.76]Why did I... could I not hogtie him?
[22:32.78]I died instantly.
[22:40.27]He wasn't even looking.
[22:41.71]He just swung in a circle and hit me right in the head.
[22:44.30]And hit me in the temple.
[22:55.31]So what's over here?
[22:55.97]Where are they?
[22:56.63]I think they got DC'd.
[23:00.67]He used all the power of his internet to hit me and then disconnect.
[23:13.05]So what am I chasing over here?
[23:25.34]Hmm, there they are.
[23:29.63]Oh no, that's very far away.
[23:36.05]No, that person's not even here.
[23:38.51]See?
[23:40.39]Let's head to town.
[23:41.43]Let's try to make some friends.
[23:42.30]I want to lasso somebody in the bar and then throw them over the balcony and then run away.
[24:02.74]Make a new death train.
[24:09.40]Make friends in a Rockstar game.
[24:10.62]Good luck.
[24:10.98]Yo, that's what I mean.
[24:12.92]Another few days or so.
[24:13.96]I feel like maybe like a week and they get all the bugs ironed out.
[24:25.40]Come in with like a group of like three or four people.
[24:27.78]Just have some fun.
[24:30.90]I think that's gonna be the plan.
[24:33.88]What the hell was that?
[24:53.09]What?
[24:59.43]Why?
[25:00.11]Why did I let it go?
[25:04.25]Was I just not close enough?
[25:07.37]Oh, they can break free.
[25:13.81]So you gotta be real close.
[25:19.02]To even attempt it.
[25:29.44]Come here!
[25:37.50]It takes so long to get over to them!
[25:49.04]Press the melee button?
[25:50.40]Well, that... I... I have to be close enough to do it.
[26:04.01]Come here!
[26:04.57]I'm gonna get you with this!
[26:25.59]This is so odd.
[26:31.01]Wait, what?
[27:06.67]Oh shit!
[27:09.74]Oh shit!
[27:10.58]Oh shit!
[27:13.56]Oh shit!
[27:29.31]No!
[27:42.39]Oh, the disconnect.
[27:47.64]I just ran into a stop sign.
[27:52.96]Imagine being on his end and watching that.
[27:55.96]Oh, I would be dead.
[27:56.90]It would kill me.
[27:58.60]I would be dead.
[28:02.22]You'd have to resurrect me.
[28:33.96]That reminds me of once when I kicked sand at somebody in elementary school and turned to run and smacked into a pole.
[28:47.19]Uh, I love that shit.
[28:48.51]It's so stupid.
[28:49.33]So, okay, so you can break out if you're actually hogtied and stowed.
[28:54.80]So what's the point of being hogtied and stowed?
[29:00.42]If it lasts, uh, like, ten seconds.
[29:06.76]I would love if that lasted... like, at least five minutes.
[29:18.70]I would so... I would love to be hogtied.
[29:20.56]And just... rot around and just... Yeah, I hear you.
[29:27.71]That'd be so funny.
[29:28.59]Alright, a rival gang is doing something.
[29:32.57]Man, just being part of somebody else's video game where you're just an NPC but you're not...
[29:49.25]I'm just having a conversation, just hanging out.
[29:50.89]I'm just like, okay.
[29:53.35]I'm still here.
[29:53.99]Alright, which one of these rival gangs?
[30:03.73]Apparently this is the rival gang I'm about to stop.
[30:06.59]I have to stop this person here.
[30:10.23]Who?
[30:14.00]Who needs to be stopped?
[30:16.34]I don't see anybody.
[30:21.18]Maybe I wasn't fast enough.
[30:25.12]Let's see if I can do it this time.
[30:31.31]No missions right now, really, because you got nothing to do?
[30:51.00]going on?
[30:53.70]Doesn't have any missions.
[30:54.58]Okay.
[30:59.10]I guess that is a response, yeah.
[31:09.09]So who we got?
[31:09.59]I could do another one of those story missions.
[31:14.42]There seems to be a lot of people...
[31:19.03]Down here.
[31:20.47]Somebody right behind me.
[31:23.73]Somebody overlooking the view down there.
[31:29.41]What does that marker mean?
[31:33.03]Index.
[31:34.27]What does it mean?
[31:34.69]I don't understand what that means.
[31:44.02]Well, I'm going to take the stagecoach to St.
[31:45.62]Denis.
[31:46.84]There's a lot of people down there.
[31:50.20]Let me spend all of my money to do that.
[31:51.76]It's only three bucks.
[32:00.41]Never mind.
[32:00.81]We're good.
[32:01.07]There's a free revolver?
[32:16.02]Well, I'll get it.
[32:17.02]I'll get it later.
[32:20.93]Can you rob people?
[32:23.89]I don't think you can just rob another player.
[32:27.61]Unless it's a specific mission where you're trying to stop them.
[32:33.54]Alright, here we are.
[32:35.74]St.
[32:35.96]Denis.
[32:41.30]Somebody this way, somebody that way.
[32:42.56]This person's trying to go do this mission, I think.
[32:45.12]Let's see if I can... No, maybe not.
[32:53.41]You got a mission?
[32:54.01]Alright, so I'm gonna be the target here.
[32:57.08]Pick up the mail bag.
[33:17.90]Deliver the mail to a series of recipients within the time limit to earn the full reward.
[33:22.26]Where's the mail?
[33:24.64]Where's the mailbag?
[33:27.18]Mailbag?
[33:30.80]Where's the mailbag?
[33:31.38]It's my friendly face, isn't it?
[33:43.96]I'm stuck in here now.
[33:45.18]I locked myself in with this fucking guy.
[33:47.92]What?
[33:49.00]How is that even possible?
[33:53.20]The door is locked.
[34:05.42]I can't pick up the mailbag because I can't get out of the mailroom.
[34:25.41]I can't do it.
[34:26.09]I'm stuck here forever.
[34:31.59]Somebody help me!
[34:32.33]Somebody come help me!
[34:36.38]How do I get someone to know that I'm in here?
[34:38.00]It makes me put it away immediately.
[35:00.04]How do you whistle?
[35:00.52]Whistle?
[35:03.59]What's a whistle?
[35:04.05]What's a whistle?
[35:09.99]I can't punch him.
[35:12.87]How do I whistle?
[35:16.21]How do I invite everybody?
[35:18.46]Lots of folks think I get bored in this job.
[35:22.04]You can see the things I've seen.
[35:25.16]Alright.
[35:26.16]Bye then.
[35:28.84]Somebody let the bird out!
[35:33.95]Respawn?
[35:34.61]I feel like I want to be in here, though.
[35:35.85]I feel like somebody could... This could be fun.
[35:39.07]How do I invite people to my location?
[35:41.35]Invites.
[35:43.27]Okay, this person here.
[35:53.74]Where's the nearest person?
[35:57.68]Just a person getting their hair cut right here.
[36:03.92]Damn it.
[36:06.90]How do I report myself?
[36:08.02]I can't.
[36:08.44]I'm stuck.
[36:08.96]Whatever.
[36:09.33]Would've been kind of fun to be in here and be the guy that is locked in here.
[36:23.61]No.
[36:24.17]I'm just fucked.
[36:31.02]How do I just respawn myself?
[36:38.12]Do I just go in and out?
[36:39.48]I'm just an NPC now.
[36:50.61]Quick join.
[36:51.41]Just quick join again.
[36:54.79]Just wait out the 10 minutes and see what happens.
[36:56.41]That's not a bad idea.
[37:00.63]That really isn't a bad idea.
[37:01.67]Ooh, I think- I figured out what to do.
[37:08.26]Somebody help me!
[37:11.22]I'm stuck in here!
[37:14.24]Help me!
[37:18.82]Help!
[37:19.70]Somebody just drove by.
[37:24.40]Somebody stop!
[37:24.88]I'm stuck in here!
[37:25.34]Somebody help me!
[37:27.12]Help me!
[37:29.28]Help!
[37:33.70]Get in here and do something, please!
[37:42.53]Help me!
[37:43.55]Open the door!
[37:44.69]See, I... I can't get out of here!
[37:51.47]See?
[37:52.35]Look!
[37:53.64]I tried everything!
[37:57.96]Help!
[38:02.42]Go get it!
[38:02.78]Go get some friends!
[38:05.14]Go get some dynamite!
[38:06.00]Do anything!
[38:06.98]Blow this up!
[38:13.90]Help!
[38:14.32]No, don't go do a mission!
[38:15.38]Help me!
[38:15.78]I'm in here!
[38:24.64]I tried the same thing.
[38:25.64]It doesn't work.
[38:32.06]There's a spot where I can shoot right here.
[38:49.43]Got it!
[38:51.61]Where is it?
[38:51.99]Right here?
[38:53.39]Right there.
[38:59.72]This guy doesn't even care that I'm just smashing the place up.
[39:03.85]Have them shoot through the window.
[39:04.91]Maybe they can shoot me through the window.
[39:05.99]I gotta get in the right place, though.
[39:20.90]Time's counting down.
[39:21.62]I wanna see what happens.
[39:27.81]Okay, it needs to be perfect in the right position.
[39:30.04]No, a little bit more to the right and right there.
[39:58.50]I was really hoping that I could shoot somebody from out of there.
[40:05.19]If I knew that I could aim out the window like that, and that guy stood there, just put it between his eyes, and then have him get angry to the point where he needs to figure out a way to get in to get to me.
[40:21.30]At that point, he's going to throw a dynamite into the window.
[40:43.99]Are admins paying attention to what the players are doing?
[40:46.15]No.
[40:47.93]It's just a problem with, uh... For some reason.
[40:51.47]I don't know what it is with my West Coast connection to the Rockstar servers, but they don't want me on here.
[40:59.82]Rockstar's servers, for me, just keep dropping.
[41:05.83]It's not my internet.
[41:07.21]My internet's fine.
[41:09.99]That somehow, wherever I'm going, doesn't like me there.
[41:14.08]Kill all the players to rise up to the leaderboard.
[41:15.34]The higher you get, the more points you're worth.
[41:16.54]See if I can just play it.
[41:24.52]Rockstar hates your rat videos.
[41:37.29]Well, I got to hear the... I got to at least hear it.
[41:44.84]Um... Well, we're going on about six hours here.
[41:53.27]It might be time to throw the towel in after, like, another couple attempts.
[42:05.12]Don't you fucking... Well... The end of the stream voice.
[42:11.38]How good does it feel to say it's not my internet?
[42:12.98]It actually feels pretty great.
[42:24.35]Do I have an opinion on online yet?
[42:25.87]No, I don't.
[42:27.19]I really don't.
[42:30.62]It looks very fun.
[42:33.24]And from the random snippets of time that I get to be in it, oh, it's great.
[42:50.87]It seems very cool once it's actually stable.
[42:57.68]He's doing the concerned professional voice.
[42:59.60]Well, you know... I'm gonna give my opinion on the video game.
[43:04.74]I'm gonna sound at least somewhat professional, so when somebody links this to... rockstar.com... Alright.
[43:20.56]Where are we right now?
[43:21.84]There's somebody over here.
[43:24.94]Okay, I'm gonna just go visit that person.
[43:33.29]Or try to do this mission.
[43:40.44]Hopefully I don't get locked into the mail room.
[43:43.04]Whatever the hell it is.
[43:43.72]I went around every inch of your house except the one place to go in.
[44:06.91]What the fuck do you want, huh?
[44:08.58]What is it?
[44:09.30]You want to get yourself killed or something, huh?
[44:12.14]I don't like getting surprised.
[44:13.92]Don't go inside.
[44:14.34]I'm going to get trapped in here.
[44:15.34]What are you looking for?
[44:19.00]You looking for work?
[44:20.02]Why am I made out of plastic?
[44:22.65]My character is made out of plastic.
[44:24.41]I know the type, eh?
[44:25.85]Strong, silent, real frightening.
[44:28.83]Still waters run deep.
[44:30.69]That type of shite, is it?
[44:33.10]Android person.
[44:33.84]Temporarily lost me friends.
[44:35.32]It's a fucking disaster.
[44:37.82]I had them.
[44:39.00]I went away for a couple of days on a killing of a bastard I owed a killing to.
[44:43.88]Good man.
[44:44.66]Melting wax figurine.
[44:46.90]Big bunch.
[44:47.66]Not like you, la.
[44:49.15]We lived like sultans in our fucking tents.
[44:52.25]I'll find them again.
[44:53.31]I've lost them before.
[44:54.87]Once it was for three months it was.
[44:57.03]That's how it goes, I guess.
[44:59.03]Anyway, where was I?
[45:01.15]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[45:02.29]Murder and mayhem.
[45:04.45]Now, I don't like to kill innocent folk myself.
[45:06.91]Gives me a real nasty feeling inside.
[45:09.31]But these bastards, well... Where does this take place during the story?
[45:12.62]These bastards are.
[45:14.32]There's a stage.
[45:15.18]I'm actually not sure.
[45:17.24]I heard a fella say it's laden with silver.
[45:19.64]I can't rob it.
[45:20.72]I can't guarantee someone else isn't going to try.
[45:23.34]But it'd be a rotten shame to let it pass by.
[45:26.14]Anyways, on with yous.
[45:30.80]Alright, matchmaking time.
[45:35.66]Ambush and rob the stagecoach.
[45:41.01]Not matchmaking.
[45:45.83]Stop the stagecoach.
[45:49.83]And steal the loot bag within the time limit.
[45:54.57]I'm assuming there's other people that are also doing this.
[45:58.53]Or trying to stop me from doing this.
[46:06.34]That would be interesting.
[46:09.42]How far away is it?
[46:10.08]Oh, it's right there.
[46:11.80]That's convenient.
[46:19.91]Right in front of me.
[46:20.45]Take on the driver, yeah!
[46:23.35]I'll try.
[46:41.89]There's so many people in there.
[46:43.95]There's a lot of people in here.
[46:47.43]Full party in this wagon.
[46:55.33]Okay, target the passengers and take the loot.
[47:04.15]What?
[47:07.46]You're not going anywhere.
[47:10.74]Give me that loot bag.
[47:12.10]Alright, get out of here.
[47:14.36]Bag.
[47:14.58]Alright, deliver the loot bag.
[47:36.62]Get out of the road.
[47:37.34]I can't stop.
[47:37.88]Get out of the road.
[47:38.42]I can't stop.
[47:42.90]That was fucking quick.
[47:56.99]Rival players can steal the loot bag.
[48:00.45]Well, they won't be doing that.
[48:02.27]That's damn... damn sure about that.
[48:16.28]Well, he's dead.
[48:17.00]No.
[48:18.02]I'm too far away.
[48:21.58]I'm kind of in the middle of fucking nowhere.
[48:25.76]Can you eat the bag?
[48:31.90]I don't think you can eat it.
[48:32.56]Alright, the horse is getting too tired.
[48:42.90]Yeah, if I get disconnected here before turning this in... Then I think that's a throw the towel up in the air situation.
[48:52.49]That's what I think.
[48:54.61]I got a bag.
[48:57.67]And it's full of loot.
[49:05.23]Stuck in the loot bag.
[49:08.95]So what do I get for doing that?
[49:12.77]One cent and two dollars.
[49:18.35]And you're telling me people can fight over that bag?
[49:22.93]Why would you fight over that bag?
[49:41.10]Is this my horse?
[49:49.39]Yeah, I can do it too, bird.
[49:56.55]Okay.
[49:57.33]Let me go into the city center.
[49:59.22]Well, that would have been cool if somebody tried to stop me.
[50:03.12]I think we're here alone.
[50:10.43]I don't think there's anybody in this session.
[50:15.23]God damn it.
[50:22.88]That's why.
[50:44.37]Well... Whoops.
[51:00.78]I think that's gonna be it.
[51:02.08]I think it's time to throw the towel in.
[51:07.71]It's just not ready yet.
[51:09.69]At least for me to play it.
[51:11.43]Maybe you can stay connected.
[51:13.21]You're from a part of the world or the country where you're able to stay connected.
[51:17.73]But Rockstar does not want me to be connected to their game for some reason.
[51:22.83]I don't know why.
[51:32.81]Sure is beautiful out here.
[51:44.96]I haven't DC'd all day.
[51:47.06]Yeah, I think it's just depending on what region you're connecting to or where you're connecting from.
[51:52.25]King of the Castle.
[51:53.17]Alright.
[51:54.15]A free roam event.
[51:55.39]Yes, I'll do it.
[51:56.47]Take me there.
[52:03.66]That's how I feel right now.
[52:16.96]Well, thanks for coming to the stream.
[52:22.90]That's, uh... That's Red Dead Redemption 2 Online.
[52:31.69]You've been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar Game Services.
[52:41.00]Red Dead Offline.
[52:43.86]Yep.
[52:46.23]well it wasn't a total loss because there was some stuff to see there and hopefully over the next day or two the service is brought up to the task of a higher standard to be able to be allowed to connect to it stay connected to it
[53:05.73]But that's going to be the end of the stream.
[53:07.77]So, again, let me make this very clear.
[53:09.95]Tomorrow night is the last day and night for you to do a green screen submission from the green screen stream a couple weeks ago.
[53:20.84]If you want to put something in, it's got to be at least 10 seconds.
[53:23.48]Can't be more than two minutes.
[53:26.48]There are rules to read that are pinned in that Discord's channel.
[53:31.08]Got to be a YouTube link.
[53:33.75]Because it's going to be going on a giant playlist.
[53:35.89]And that deadline is tomorrow.
[53:39.23]Tomorrow night.
[53:41.27]Submissions will not be considered if they come in after tomorrow night.
[53:47.82]And with that, I will see you guys on Friday.
[53:52.82]Friday, we're going to do Jackbox.
[53:56.08]Which will lead us into Sunday.
[53:59.36]Which will be the green screen movie night.
[54:03.72]this should be the thumbnail and I may even stream on Saturday as well we might go Friday Saturday Sunday depending on uh what's available because if Red Dead works by Saturday then maybe we'll do a thing where it's Friday is jackbox Saturday is Red Dead online maybe get a few friends get a few people to join into a squad and then Sunday will be movie night so we'll give it a try
[54:31.33]Do I have a schedule yet?
[54:32.45]I don't.
[54:33.99]I don't.
[54:34.33]And I know it's been about three or four straight weeks here of streaming in Vegas on Pacific Time.
[54:40.15]And I'm like, yeah, I got a schedule.
[54:44.49]I don't know.
[54:48.35]Maybe I just won't.
[54:53.33]Maybe I'll just stream.
[54:55.43]Because I... Here's the long and short of that.
[55:00.95]I've been streaming more often since being here.
[55:03.51]Right?
[55:05.41]So let me put the outro on so people don't think I'm sticking around.
[55:10.07]I've been streaming more often.
[55:13.16]So... I think that having the opportunity to just kind of plan each week.
[55:23.76]Because then it's like, oh, okay, so here's what's going to happen.
[55:25.36]I'm going to do this on Monday, Tuesday, and then like Thursday, Friday.
[55:28.94]Maybe I'll just stay with it for a while.
[55:32.70]I think the start time will always be the same.
[55:34.70]It'll always be somewhere around 3 p.m.
[55:37.62]Pacific.
[55:38.82]Between like 2 to 3 p.m., 3-ish p.m.
[55:42.34]Pacific.
[55:49.97]But I'm not sure.
[55:50.63]I think when I have a schedule... I've talked about schedules before, and it's great, and it helps.
[55:57.13]But I feel like I've been streaming more often.
[56:00.47]Because when I have a schedule...
[56:02.55]Oh, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[56:04.41]That's it.
[56:05.53]That's when I stream.
[56:06.35]Just Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[56:07.87]That's when I'm live.
[56:09.41]I'm not live any... I don't do anything else.
[56:12.09]Having no schedule allows me to kind of just do what I want, and sometimes that even means streaming four or five days a week.
[56:19.30]I don't know.
[56:19.62]I haven't come to a conclusion yet, but for now, I'm still going to be schedule-less for now.
[56:29.23]But, let's do the bits.
[56:30.71]Thanks for sticking around.
[56:31.57]I'll see you hopefully on Friday for Jackbox 5.
[56:39.52]And then hope to see you again this weekend.
[56:44.62]I gotta take the offline screen down, but I gotta change it before I do that.
[56:48.36]Because I don't want it to just be like a default thing.
[56:50.50]I gotta have that ready.
[56:51.98]It's gonna go in and just edit it.
[56:55.49]But, let's start back six plus hours ago here.
[56:59.81]Shrapnel, or Shcrapnel, thanks for the $1.
[57:04.72]Thanks also to MostlyLostForThe$1.
[57:07.06]Jerma, if all you did for the rest of your career was just stream character creation sequences, I'd be perfectly happy.
[57:15.92]I do love creating characters.
[57:17.48]It is a lot of fun.
[57:20.21]It is one of my favorite things.
[57:22.99]But, thank you.
[57:25.85]Thank you to Divas P for the three bucks.
[57:29.44]Coming in with a three spot.

[57:37.14]Thank you for the three dollars.
[57:38.20]Thank you for consistent three dollars pretty much every stream.
[57:42.25]And more than that.

[57:46.71]Thank you.

[58:27.27]Uh, Yen Wen, thank you Yen Wen, Yen Wen Lin for the $1.
[58:32.43]I've been enjoying your Red Dead streams, especially the two and a half hour death train bit you did.
[58:37.49]I decided to draw a picture of you and Francis the Fox.
[58:40.52]You technically owe me like $200 now, but I'll let it slide.
[58:44.18]Wait, what?
[58:45.64]This image is for you only.
[58:47.32]You can show chat, but please don't share the link.

[60:03.40]You gotta look at this shit, guys.
[60:04.54]Oh my god.
[60:13.26]I feel like I need to hang this in my living room.
[60:29.12]That has to go over a mantle.
[60:32.21]Wow.
[60:42.37]Nice fucking job.
[60:51.48]Hanging in the living room.
[60:55.58]I'm gonna, like, just have a... I'm gonna have a copy of that.
[60:57.48]It's gonna be sitting right here on my desk.
[61:02.06]But thank you.
[61:02.58]That's Yen Wen Len.
[61:04.56]Yen Wen Len.

[63:24.67]There are a couple of very obvious answers here.
[63:25.89]Uh... There's... Diablo II is one of my favorite games.
[63:27.01]I have thousands of hours in that game.
[63:27.95]Binding of Isaac is another one.
[63:55.02]If you just want to just fall into a video game and just keep doing run after run, and it's just something that you always play, Binding of Isaac is probably the best one, I would say, in this current kind of generation.
[64:04.99]Uh, I'd also tell you to play Team Fortress 2.
[64:09.71]But, I mean, maybe if, like, maybe if you asked this, like, two or three years ago, maybe I'd say that.
[64:15.46]I just, I don't know what the state of the game is, really, at all.
[64:19.08]So, but, if you've never played TF2 before, it's kind of just, uh,
[64:24.05]It's kind of just opening up an entire world of fun shit to do.
[64:33.56]Diablo II, he's a boomer.
[64:36.08]Diablo II is so good.
[64:38.45]It is so much fun.
[64:44.15]It's just the best, but it's just not... Maybe, you know, take Diablo II off that list unless you can handle like an 800x600 window.
[64:52.06]Because the game has never been patched up and never been brought to current graphical standards.
[64:58.84]If you can tolerate that game for being technically horrible, then it is definitely one of the best games I've ever played.
[65:07.97]It's amazing.
[65:13.31]But yeah, Binding of Isaac is probably the easiest one to say.
[65:18.45]You can put an infinite amount of time in that game and still have fun.
[65:23.33]And apparently a new expansion is coming out here in the next few months, right?
[65:28.75]Isn't Edmund going to kind of bring in that mod?
[65:33.89]That kind of fan-made mod or something?
[65:39.67]Oh, look at me.
[65:40.07]I'm Jerma.
[65:40.55]I beat Bael and Mephisto and Andariel.
[65:42.81]Oh, I'm a boomer.
[65:47.29]Yeah, there are plenty of people that are like 19 right now that just played through Diablo II last weekend.
[65:56.15]Oh, look at me.
[65:59.10]But, uh, thank you, WildFox.
[66:03.06]Enjoy your gaming.
[66:05.24]And enjoy your time off.
[66:10.14]Mostly lost.
[66:10.62]Thanks for the $1.
[66:11.39]Here's barking.
[66:12.13]Oh my god.

[66:14.47]jermaIQ?
[66:19.97]JLPag, thanks for the $6.
[66:23.29]Six bucks from JL.
[66:27.25]How come you never juggle on stream?
[66:28.45]I'd like to spectate you juggling again.
[66:33.02]I'll try it.
[66:33.44]Alright, next stream, on Friday before we do, uh, any, anything at all.
[66:39.68]I'm, I'll juggle.
[66:40.76]I'll get like three dog toys and juggle them.
[66:47.05]Uh, thank you Ammit the Devourer for the $1.
[66:50.19]Chat, if you don't know, today is Jeremy's birthday.
[66:53.03]It's not true, but thank you for the happy, happy birthday wishes.
[66:56.66]Thanks a lot.
[66:57.22]Thank you MostlyLost for the $1.
[66:59.99]When you asked if you could hogtie people, literally one guy in chat said no.
[67:03.62]And everyone else said yes.
[67:05.26]And you somehow picked out that one guy.
[67:15.32]The key word in quotes there is one guy.
[67:20.18]I can't wait to surprise you guys at the next like Jerma Rumble like six months from now.
[67:24.98]The one guy is going to be in there and he's going to win.
[67:28.80]I'm going to say it's that one guy from chat that asked if he could be in the Rumble tonight, and I said yes.
[67:34.16]The one guy.
[67:35.22]There it is.
[67:35.88]There's a new character for you.
[67:39.60]Yeah.
[67:44.00]Yeah, I just looked over at chat, and then one guy just was like, hey, can I please just be in the Rumble tonight?
[67:48.32]And I said, sure, and I put him in.
[67:50.94]That's proof that you could be that one guy soon.
[67:57.01]Thank you, Holobunzombie, for the $1.
[67:58.55]No message.
[67:59.01]Thank you.
[68:00.55]Thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[68:01.99]Broke half my thumbnail off.
[68:04.53]Still working on that painting, though.
[68:05.89]Hope the rest of your night goes smoothly.
[68:08.23]Thank you, Jess.
[68:12.73]Well, I had fun.
[68:15.77]I feel pretty good.
[68:18.26]I mean, look, the game was a little, a little janky all over the place tonight, but, you know, that's not, nothing that we can do about that.
[68:25.44]Just gonna have to deal with it, right?
[68:30.63]But no, I feel good.
[68:32.27]I had fun.
[68:34.93]Hey, Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[68:36.37]That was a pretty good IRL stream.
[68:37.81]I think I've seen better, though.
[68:38.99]IRL?
[68:48.77]Uh, thank you, Flugboy, for the one dollar.
[68:51.19]Garbage?
[68:51.41]What?
[69:09.06]No, don't think that.
[69:13.01]Look, it's not a contest.
[69:15.45]Nobody wins.
[69:16.81]There is no, oh, that's the best one, you win.
[69:19.17]No.
[69:19.87]We're just gonna have fun, we're gonna watch a bunch of shit.
[69:24.80]It's just gonna be a fun night.
[69:27.76]No one is gonna be judging everybody.
[69:31.01]No, it's just for fun.
[69:46.56]I'll be judging everyone.
[69:50.78]No, it's gonna be fun.
[69:51.84]I can't wait.
[69:52.24]I'm actually very excited for it, so.
[69:55.61]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[69:56.93]Any thoughts on the Flintstones GTA title Rockstar is making?
[70:02.17]It's probably gonna be terrible.
[70:04.15]Hey, I'm Pink.
[70:04.85]Thanks for the $5, I'm Pink.
[70:06.05]Hey, Jerma, I watched you back when you started TF2, and I have now just somehow found your streams.
[70:10.84]Much love.
[70:11.88]Well, it was a long time ago.
[70:14.16]Welcome back.
[70:16.41]still going just kind of in a different avenue I've since I've since stopped all uh all youtube main channel we've talked about it a lot of times but the transition to Twitch has been uh has been pretty smooth I think for me so but transitioning to Twitch does not mean that I stopped trying to do the things that I wanted to do
[70:45.91]I hope I have made that clear.
[70:48.29]I hope I've... you know... I hope my actions have tried to prove that moving from YouTube to Twitch has not changed how I approach anything.
[70:58.91]I hope I've achieved that.
[71:00.61]But I'm still trying, so... Need another Spider-Man video.
[71:11.39]When can I buy shirts?
[71:13.42]Coming soon!
[71:15.10]Coming soon.
[71:19.56]You've changed, man.
[71:24.58]Where are the shirts?
[71:25.16]Where are the shirts?
[71:25.72]I know, I know.
[71:26.30]I know.
[71:29.10]They'll be here at some point.
[71:34.17]But thank you, I'm Pink for the $5.
[71:35.85]Welcome back.
[71:36.25]If we see you again, we see you again.
[71:38.69]Maybe you'll check in on us again soon.
[71:41.11]Take care.
[71:42.66]And thank you for your $5.
[71:43.54]Thank you, JLPag, again for $5.
[71:46.28]Me and these people pay good money to watch you juggle, but instead you're killing people.
[71:50.55]What would your parents say?
[71:55.97]I told you, I'm gonna juggle on Friday.
[72:03.71]Thank you, JL.
[72:04.43]Thank you, Dr. Nub.
[72:07.21]Dr. Nub Stein for the $5. $5?
[72:11.26]Jeremy, I purchased my first bits ever to tell you that your stream volume is so low compared to the rest of Twitch, my TV is maxed.
[72:18.78]You used this money to buy extra volume.
[72:24.01]But is it though?
[72:24.89]Okay, right now I'm looking over at, I'm looking over at my OBS.
[72:30.89]And my OBS right now is telling me that I am right now in the yellow.
[72:37.87]I am at minus 6 dB when I'm talking, which is barely into red.
[72:49.14]Volume levels are all fine, but the master level is super low.
[72:51.90]I don't know why that is.
[72:53.72]Because... Whenever an ad plays, it's really fucking loud.
[73:00.94]I don't know how to fix this thing either.
[73:05.95]So yeah, but that's just like the nature of the internet with ads.
[73:14.43]Your stream is always very quiet.
[73:15.87]I mean, even the game too, like for instance, ready?
[73:19.64]Like how is this for volume?
[73:21.18]What does that sound like?
[73:24.18]Because right now, according to OBS, I'm about to like peak, I'm about to peak my system audio.
[73:37.05]Wait, ready?
[73:38.05]Right now, I am matching the volume.
[73:40.85]So right now, I should be as loud as the thing that you were listening to right now.
[73:44.80]On OBS, they are matched up perfectly.
[73:48.38]And I'm not.
[73:50.52]That's very strange.
[73:51.76]Because they are exactly the same on OBS.
[73:53.60]I don't know why.
[74:04.62]Bro, this is loud.
[74:08.38]Maybe it's like a thing of how OBS is pumping out the audio.
[74:14.25]I'm going to look into that.
[74:16.15]I actually am because I'm curious about that.
[74:18.25]It makes no sense.
[74:27.31]OBS does the same thing for me.
[74:33.82]You're always more quiet than other media I watch on my computer?
[74:38.24]That's so odd.
[74:40.78]I don't know.
[74:41.83]I'll see if there's any settings or something I can change, or maybe I... Because if I go any louder than this, and I'm gonna give you a fair warning here, I'm gonna get loud, so just prepare it.
[74:51.31]So right now, like, I am not loud to you, right?
[74:54.18]This is like, oh, he's quiet, I gotta turn him way up.
[74:57.28]If I start to get loud, or if I pull this further to the max, it's gonna... So, I'm about to peak right now.
[75:06.58]I'm gonna peak.
[75:07.00]I'm just warning you, just be ready for it.
[75:08.98]Like, I'm gonna peak my microphone, and it's gonna be as loud as it's possibly able to be on OBS.
[75:18.26]Was that, like, was that the... Did that match the other media on your computer?
[75:28.75]That wasn't even that loud.
[75:31.61]That's like, on OBS, I was at the very end of the red, the red bar was like, don't fucking do that, pull back.
[75:47.84]Well, I don't know, that's weird.
[75:51.72]I might, maybe I'll ask Twitch about it.
[75:53.24]See if I, maybe I'll get an answer.
[75:54.80]See if there's something I should do or something that needs to be done.
[76:02.44]That was quieter than when you were explaining you were going to be loud.
[76:06.78]That's really weird.
[76:10.04]Don't you have a compressor?
[76:11.34]I mean, I have a software compressor.
[76:13.92]But that doesn't change the fact that all of the audio is low.
[76:21.25]The Windows mic volume input is about, is it 100?
[76:23.13]Because watch this, ready?
[76:29.31]If I fuck with the gain on this thing,
[76:31.91]Now we're in like really fucked up territory, right?
[76:34.47]Because this is very, very loud and that's so loud.
[76:42.45]But you tell me, is this matching... Is this matching how loud your computer game is?
[76:54.20]This is on par with other streams.
[76:58.76]I hear airplanes.
[77:01.57]So I need to be louder than this.
[77:03.23]Are you sure that you want me to do that?
[77:05.71]Because this is just too... I... This is better.
[77:10.35]Are you... I am in... I'm gonna peak.
[77:18.00]This is actually good.
[77:19.06]It's gonna break.
[77:21.40]I'm gonna break it.
[77:22.48]OBS is telling me, turn this down.
[77:24.68]This is so fucking awful.
[77:28.17]Okay, back to where we were before.
[77:31.01]So now OBS is telling me, okay, thank God you did that because this was awful.
[77:40.22]Just be flattered that people are raising their volume just to watch you.
[77:45.54]But I mean, is that really that big of a deal?
[77:48.84]That, what, you have to drag the bar an inch to the right?
[77:51.56]It is?
[77:59.79]I had to click.
[78:00.53]I had to go into a scream test.
[78:02.23]Is that loud?
[78:15.79]How loud is that?
[78:18.89]Is it quieter?
[78:19.57]Louder?
[78:26.35]Now it's too quiet.
[78:28.74]Well, that's because I'm turning it up and down.
[78:37.35]It's really... Alright, let's move on before I fucking get stuck doing this for like an hour.
[78:46.69]Alright, so... We only have a couple more bits.
[78:49.31]Thank you to... The... The Lemon Guy.
[78:55.08]Thank you, The Lemon Guy, for the 10 bucks.
[78:58.89]Gerber is a ploopy poopy with bad audio.
[79:01.95]I don't have bad audio.
[79:06.85]If you want me to have bad audio, I'll plug in the webcam mic or like a headset mic.
[79:16.38]What'd he say?
[79:16.88]I can't hear him.
[79:17.90]What'd he say?
[79:18.56]I can't hear him.
[79:24.88]Thank you for the $10 though, Lemon Guy.
[79:27.05]I appreciate it.
[79:29.59]Thank you to Garfield, the Monday Killer for the $1.
[79:32.00]Thanks, Garfield.
[79:33.85]They say, reach for the sky, there's a snake in my boots.
[79:36.93]And other cowboy quotes.
[79:38.04]Howdy there, Jerma.
[79:38.76]Don't y'all find today a mite historic?
[79:42.34]Remember your first Red Dead stream when you were ranting about my comics?
[79:45.96]That's actually what got me to start making enough money to give you my rootin' tootin' Garfagraphs every single stream.
[79:52.11]Feels like yesterday you were placing censor bars over pictures of me, Garfield.
[79:56.61]Well, Jerma, I guess everything comes full circle.
[79:58.21]Cowboys and Garfields like Earth and Tent.
[80:03.74]You're genuinely quiet now.
[80:06.06]Well, hold on a minute.
[80:06.80]Let me fix that.
[80:07.94]Let me fix that and scream as loud as I can into the microphone.
[80:11.10]No.
[80:11.42]There we go.
[80:11.72]We're good?
[80:12.22]Good?
[80:12.60]Are we good now?
[80:13.96]How's that?
[80:15.20]I think I fixed it.
[80:15.88]We're good right there.
[80:16.84]We're good right there.
[80:19.02]Well, thank you, Garfield, for your $1.
[80:21.70]Appreciate it.
[80:23.22]And for... Yeah, that is true.
[80:25.44]That was the Red Dead, original Red Dead stream.
[80:30.78]Thank you, Garfield, for sticking around this long.
[80:37.29]Well, welcome to the Boomer Club because how would you know something like that?
[80:47.57]You would only know that if you were also a Boomer too.
[80:52.73]So you know that.
[80:53.85]What, you're gonna look that up on D2 Wikipedia?
[80:57.36]No, you need extreme detailed knowledge of that game to know what that even means.
[81:01.58]So welcome to the Boomer Club!
[81:04.08]Thanks for joining!
[81:06.96]Thank you, Pin.
[81:11.67]Uh, Gond or Lane, thanks for the $1.
[81:12.87]If you're looking for a game suggestion, I already suggested this in the Discord, but you certainly enjoy the Sam & Max games.
[81:18.35]A very comedic puzzle series with comedy very similar to yours.
[81:21.96]I feel it's been a long while since you played a point-and-click series.
[81:25.43]If you're looking to start, start with Season 1 and play through 2.
[81:29.47]3 is kind of meh, but it's still a really good series.
[81:33.69]Good point-and-click puzzle with comedy to match yours.
[81:36.33]It's on Steam and it's on Good Old Games.
[81:44.80]Yeah, I love point-and-click adventure games.
[81:50.38]It's a me, Mario.
[81:54.70]But yeah.
[81:58.66]I never really gave SamMX a look.
[82:02.15]People look into it.
[82:03.17]I never gave it a look, you know?
[82:04.09]I never gave it a look.
[82:05.77]I never looked into it.
[82:07.95]But I look into it.
[82:12.12]Wasn't it a cartoon?
[82:14.14]It was a cartoon, right?
[82:19.95]Now, maybe we'll do a adventure game again.
[82:22.09]It needs to be the right time and the right mindset where I can kind of just chill and do it.
[82:27.48]There's so many games that have come out, there's so many things that I still have to do and so many things that I want to do.
[82:32.68]When there's a lull here in game releases and projects that I'd like to put together or try to do, then we can kind of start to tap into stuff that is not like, on the cards right now, in quotes, right?
[82:48.28]But, thank you for the suggestion.
[82:51.69]Maybe some points in.
[82:56.87]Uh, and then ExtraCheesy at the end, thanks for $1, ExtraCheesy.
[82:59.89]Can you make a line of Jerma Gucci purses, please?
[83:02.19]I need it to look cool in school.
[83:07.45]Uh, I don't know how cool you'd look with a purse from me.
[83:12.05]People would probably look at you and say, what the fuck is that?
[83:16.62]Why, who's, who's Jerma?
[83:21.72]And then you'd have to explain who I am.
[83:24.34]And it would be a long conversation.
[83:29.80]But, as the credits roll for the subs... Shitload of subs tonight.
[83:36.84]I feel like there's a shitload of subs every fucking time.
[83:42.25]There are so many people.
[83:43.69]Every time.
[83:49.05]Would love to see a Peggle stream.
[83:53.82]Sure you would.
[83:55.82]Sure you would.
[83:57.86]Wait till Peggle 3 comes out.
[84:03.06]I'm just gonna play Peggle 3.
[84:03.82]In, like, the bathtub.
[84:04.68]200,000 followers soon?
[84:05.04]Oh, fuck, yeah, that's right.
[84:21.06]5 million views.
[84:22.06]5.4 million views.
[84:23.84]We passed 5 million views.
[84:25.40]Thanks for that.
[84:26.13]That's a lot.
[84:28.41]Getting close to 200,000 followers.
[84:31.01]Holy shit, that's a lot of people following on Twitch.
[84:34.49]Well, thanks guys.
[84:37.96]200,000 followers, almost.
[84:39.40]That's a lot.
[84:42.06]He cares more about his followers than his 50,000 seagulls.
[84:53.44]That's true.
[84:57.39]I mean, yeah, I do.
[84:59.47]Sorry, what's that?
[85:00.03]I care more about the 200,000 people that have decided to follow this stream and that watch the stream?
[85:07.32]Yes, I do.
[85:07.98]I care more about the viewers of this stream than a seagull meme from seven months ago.
[85:16.10]I mean, I do.
[85:18.13]Are you?
[85:18.77]What?
[85:25.18]Money givers?
[85:26.90]What?
[85:27.34]No, I said followers.
[85:28.66]I didn't say subscribers.
[85:31.08]Followers are not subscribers.
[85:33.38]It's free to follow.
[85:39.13]200,000 piggy banks.
[85:42.87]No.
[85:44.53]Don't say that or I'm going to ban you.
[85:47.91]Next person to say that or I'm going to ban you.
[85:50.69]You know what I'm saying?
[85:56.61]I am unfollowing to support the seagulls.
[86:06.55]Jerma doesn't care about subs.
[86:08.40]What?!
[86:10.46]DickyStreamer doesn't like seagulls!
[86:14.46]I'm gonna hide behind my 50,000 seagull army that we saved.
[86:27.04]Oh, what's that?
[86:27.90]Get out of here!
[86:28.28]Wait, you don't think I can do it again?
[86:31.56]What's this?
[86:38.30]It's gone again!
[86:40.36]No one can talk.
[86:42.92]No one's allowed to talk now.
[86:53.79]I have better twitch.tv I can still see.
[86:57.40]They should do something about that, because the streamer shouldn't want to be in control of his own stream.
[87:02.37]And being able to dodge a clear of that, that shouldn't happen.
[87:06.19]I want to talk to somebody who makes it so they don't have that anymore.
[87:20.48]Okay.
[87:22.32]That was a mouthful.
[87:24.86]That's gonna be it, guys.
[87:25.72]I'll see you on Friday.
[87:26.87]Thanks for sticking around.
[87:28.15]Thanks for having fun.
[87:29.35]I had fun.
[87:31.97]We'll play some video games this weekend, I can assure you.
[87:37.43]Take care, everybody.
[87:39.17]We did have a couple of small bits come in.
[87:41.35]One, two, three.
[87:42.35]$1 from Cosmic Moses, $1 from Zazasalt, and $1 from Aerolus.
[87:47.92]Thank you for your $1 each.
[87:50.26]You guys are fucking awesome.
[87:54.76]We did have a little bit of bits that came in.
[87:59.38]Cosmic Mimosa says, you did this.
[88:09.13]I don't... What the fuck?
[88:22.18]I don't understand.
[88:28.07]And you guys wanted me to put the beard back on.
[88:34.06]I was getting screamed at.
[88:35.08]There were almost 4,000 people in this chat.
[88:38.52]When we were starting.
[88:40.56]Over 4,000 people were yelling as loud as they could.
[88:43.46]Put the beard back on.
[88:54.48]But thank you.
[88:54.98]Thank you also for Zaza for $1 paying my follower tax.
[88:59.20]Thank you.
[88:59.98]And then errorless at the very end.
[89:02.74]I don't know if anyone's mentioned this yet, but I think most of us would be totally fine with you using WWE 2K14 in future rumbles instead of the crap that is 2K19.
[89:10.64]I agree with you.
[89:11.70]There's one issue.
[89:13.32]It does not hold up well.
[89:14.40]The loading times are so bad.
[89:15.88]And once you have more than 5 to 10, 20 characters that are created in that game, and when you have more than like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 layers in 2K14, it takes like a full minute to load hair on somebody.
[89:29.77]It's just not, it doesn't hold up.
[89:35.14]Unfortunately.
[89:36.18]Going back would be hard to do.
[89:42.41]But with that, I'll see you guys on Friday.
[89:47.59]Have a great rest of your week.
[89:49.47]See you soon.
[89:50.35]Friday, Saturday, Sunday is the plan.
[89:53.30]At this moment.
[89:55.01]Good night.
[89:55.59]Good luck.
[89:56.77]Get your submission into the green screen.
[89:58.33]If you haven't done it already, go check it out.
[89:59.99]It's tomorrow night around 12 a.m.
[90:04.19]at 1201.
[90:05.07]They are no longer... They are no longer allowed to be... They are no longer... Western Pennsylvania is the most patriotic, patriotic, loving place in all of America.
[90:19.04]And that's why...
