[00:02.91]Hello, everybody.
[00:03.51]Welcome to the stream.
[00:07.81]Sorry, I was in chat talking about taxes.
[00:12.39]We were discussing taxes.
[00:15.99]Paying taxes and all that stuff.
[00:18.43]What are taxes?
[00:19.25]You know, we had to go through an entire... This is for the VOD viewers, by the way.
[00:23.32]We had to go through an entire thing of what taxes are dating back to the British, right?
[00:30.50]That's where it started.
[00:33.37]That's you know, that's how that's where it began and now the British now run the IRS so we still have to pay England It's weird, but you know No
[00:54.59]The one thing about taxes I will tell you is if you are 1099, right?
[01:01.31]Because I used to be, you get a W-2 and somebody pays your taxes.
[01:06.70]And so you took out money for health insurance and retirement and okay, I don't have to do anything.
[01:13.36]When you become full 1099, it's all you, man.
[01:16.86]You got to do it all.
[01:17.44]And it's just like, wait, hold on.
[01:20.51]What do I have to do?
[01:24.51]But, uh... Back in 2011, I got a CPA.
[01:29.53]And I made sure, I was like, please, like, make sure this is all correct, thank you!
[01:32.69]And I've been using them for, like, seven years.
[01:43.41]Keep those receipts, oh yeah.
[01:47.65]And they have to, like, under- that's, like, the next part, is understanding what is, like, an expense, what isn't an expense.
[01:54.56]Yeah.
[01:56.72]It's difficult stuff.
[02:00.26]QuickBooks self-employed is pretty helpful.
[02:03.72]Yeah, I just, I'm an idiot and I'll fuck something up.
[02:06.78]I'd rather just have somebody that knows what they're doing that specializes in it be able to do it because I can't.
[02:14.00]I'll open up QuickBooks and I'll be like, oh yeah, this, this, this, this.
[02:17.34]Send it in.
[02:17.90]I'll get it wrong.
[02:19.18]Mm-mm.
[02:22.96]No, no, no.
[02:28.25]A good accountant is like a good mechanic.
[02:30.23]If you find one, do everything you can to keep them.
[02:32.61]That's the best statement I've read in the last 10 seconds.
[02:43.09]Even everything laid out, it's... And never do it for free.
[02:55.53]The next statement is the best.
[02:58.07]What about a barber?
[02:59.22]Yeah, there are a couple of things that you really need to hold on to in life.
[03:03.30]A good CPA, like a good accountant, right?
[03:07.84]A good doctor, right?
[03:09.83]Everybody wants a good doctor, good accountant, good doctor, good car mechanic.
[03:13.99]A good lawyer.
[03:16.43]A good chef.
[03:17.39]Make sure you always have a good chef around in your house.
[03:21.12]A good maid to make sure you're very clean.
[03:25.42]All these people have to come with you, by the way, wherever you go.
[03:28.56]And they all need a room in your house.
[03:31.71]A good mailman, that's right, yeah.
[03:41.77]Imagine you had a doctor live in your house.
[03:44.83]That'd be fucking amazing.
[03:46.91]That'd be the best thing ever.
[03:49.21]I wish that were the case.
[03:51.78]Imagine waking up, like you're brushing your teeth and you're like, wait, hold on.
[03:55.16]You like, you stick your tongue out.
[03:56.70]There's like a little spot on your tongue and like your tongue hurts.
[03:59.68]That's happened to me.
[04:00.33]And what, am I going to make a doctor's appointment for that?
[04:03.43]No, no.
[04:03.77]You just go bang, bang, just like, hey doc.
[04:07.77]And he's like, it's like six o'clock in the morning.
[04:10.03]He's like, fuck, what is it?
[04:11.67]Hey, look at my tongue for a second.
[04:13.74]He's like, hold on to me.
[04:14.60]And he pulls the tongue and let me see that.
[04:16.96]No, that's just an inflamed taste bud.
[04:18.42]You're going to be fine.
[04:19.26]It's like, oh God.
[04:20.18]And he goes back to bed.
[04:26.44]And then like you go to the next, while that happens, I drop a plate and it smashes on the ground and the doctor goes back to bed and I'm like, yeah, don't worry about it.
[04:33.73]I go to the next door.
[04:36.42]Uh, do- Maid?
[04:38.79]Open the door?
[04:39.27]Yeah?
[04:40.17]I just dropped a plane on the ground.
[04:41.49]Can you, like, help?
[04:42.11]Can you take care of that?
[04:43.93]Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
[04:44.73]Like, they take care of that, and you're good.
[04:49.54]Oh, God, that's got $50.
[04:50.28]I'm just gonna have, like, a hotel of employees.
[04:56.97]Not even employees, though.
[05:00.35]It's just all people that do jobs.
[05:03.19]That are very, like, skilled jobs.
[05:06.43]Things that are difficult to do.
[05:09.65]Service jobs.
[05:11.86]Have, like, a police officer, too.
[05:13.48]Just to have in here.
[05:14.94]Just in case, like, the doctor fights the mechanic.
[05:18.44]Over breakfast or something.
[05:19.44]Like, somebody picks up a fork and he starts to lunge.
[05:21.48]No, the cop is gonna take care of that.
[05:29.85]Just explaining.
[05:31.05]This is the White House.
[05:33.07]This is just being the president.
[05:36.27]This is being the president.
[05:48.96]Anyways.
[05:52.93]Thank you to- to- alright, to back us up here.
[05:56.07]Yes.
[05:57.62]Uh... Having a good... accountant is a good thing to have, especially if you're 1099.
[06:03.96]Because you gotta make sure you buy the book.
[06:07.78]Otherwise, uh... I'm gonna have to answer that door.
[06:11.21]And it's my turn to open the door.
[06:13.57]And it's a fucking laundry list of, excuse me, you're coming to court now.
[06:17.11]And I'm like, hold on, wait a minute.
[06:19.01]Get the chef!
[06:19.75]And the chef comes down, he's like, what's happening?
[06:23.12]And he's like, oh, you're getting arrested.
[06:24.60]Alright, whatever.
[06:25.12]I can't do anything about that.
[06:32.57]Or it was the chef.
[06:33.79]And I take the chef and I push him in front of it.
[06:35.97]It was the chef that did it.
[06:36.89]What are you talking about?
[06:40.69]I just cooked it.
[06:41.26]They like cuff him up.
[06:50.08]He, oh yeah, he was cooking the books, don't you understand?
[06:53.54]And then I like wink at the, I wink at the fucking guy, at the, at the, the, the officer at the door.
[06:58.57]I'm like... Fuck that whole segment.
[07:12.82]What do you mean that joke was awful?
[07:14.30]Somebody, one of you guys said that.
[07:15.82]I was responding to it.
[07:21.22]That was a great joke, actually.
[07:24.00]Mod that guy that made it.
[07:26.55]No one said that.
[07:27.25]Yes, they did.
[07:28.21]Scroll up.
[07:29.11]They're now modded.
[07:32.57]Okay, anyway, what are we doing?
[07:34.17]Where am I?
[07:34.93]I'm in front of a stream.
[07:39.21]Oh, shift the blame.
[07:40.03]Yeah, it was this guy.
[07:41.29]It was this guy.
[07:41.83]Take him.
[07:45.27]It was me.
[07:50.52]Alright, we're gonna play Jack Pox... Jack Pox Party Pox.
[07:55.42]That's what we call it here.
[07:56.30]We're gonna play Jack Box tonight.
[07:58.74]And we might as well just switch over to it right now because why not?
[08:01.65]It's right here.
[08:03.81]Jack Pox Party Pack... Jack Pox Party Pack 5.
[08:11.00]It is going to be fun.
[08:15.30]Did I say it was going to be fun?
[08:17.64]Why am I speaking in the past tense here?
[08:19.30]That doesn't make very much sense.
[08:22.19]But!
[08:22.91]But more importantly, $50 came in from CookieCRM.
[08:26.17]Fifty.
[08:27.65]Fifty.
[08:29.01]Dollars.
[08:30.03]Thank you Cookie for the 50 bucks.
[08:33.11]Hey Jerma, just a heads up.
[08:34.57]Patently Stupid is not a good game for stream.
[08:36.87]It's not very funny or fun to play.
[08:39.91]Split the Room and Madverse City are fantastic.
[08:45.72]Alright, well, we'll see.
[08:48.72]I mean, we're going to try them all.
[08:51.16]Even if we do it once.
[08:52.80]But I have heard that a few of these, at least two or three of them are very fun and very funny.
[08:58.87]But whatever, this is community night.
[09:02.91]You know, we do sometimes, we do community night here.
[09:05.86]You know what I mean?
[09:14.70]By the way, speaking of that, how this is going to work tonight is... Whoa, that just kind of scared me.
[09:22.13]So, in the sub room of the Discord is going to get the code.
[09:28.65]There are a lot of you now, so good luck getting into the room.
[09:33.04]If you get into the room, we kindly ask that you do not come back for another game.
[09:41.37]uh you can only play once if there's a way that I can remove somebody or I have to restart or something that's what we're going to do or we might have to make a separate room I will figure it out right but only one time only one time so
[10:02.42]I hope you're ready to begin.
[10:03.60]Because I'm ready to begin.
[10:05.20]Which one are we gonna start with?
[10:06.38]How about we just go from top to bottom?
[10:08.24]Does that make sense?
[10:09.70]Why is this one not family-friendly?
[10:11.32]This is the only one that's not family-friendly.
[10:17.11]What does that mean?
[10:21.54]We mean it.
[10:22.48]Well, what does that mean, though?
[10:28.73]Alright, well, apparently, okay, this is the not safe for work trivia game.
[10:36.36]Alright, let's do it.
[10:37.22]You don't know Jack.
[10:39.24]You don't know Jack shit.
[10:42.06]So how's the audio?
[10:42.70]Should I turn myself down?
[10:43.48]What are you trying to say?
[10:45.56]What are you trying to say?
[10:47.76]What are you trying to say?
[10:54.02]Oh, I didn't tell Twitter.
[10:59.74]You're right, I didn't tell Twitter.
[11:07.92]What do you say?
[11:08.62]This is the stream, this is people looking up at my bald fucking head.
[11:11.80]I'm not even bald.
[11:13.82]Why do we do this thing on this channel where things are just absolutely 100% not true, and we treat them like they are?
[11:22.05]You died to pinwheel.
[11:22.91]No, I didn't.
[11:23.73]You're bald.
[11:24.43]I have fucking more hair than probably half the people on this website.
[11:30.58]I got a full head of hair.
[11:31.78]What's the bulb thing?
[11:38.54]You're stupid.
[11:39.92]Oh, really?
[11:40.32]I can't... Alright, well that one might... I can't fight that one.
[11:51.27]You're short.
[11:53.57]Not that short.
[11:55.23]It's...
[12:01.21]Alright, let me tweet this up.
[12:04.87]Oh, Chunky Baloney!
[12:08.30]Chunky Baloney giving out five community subs.
[12:12.00]Thank you, Chunky.
[12:16.02]That is five.
[12:17.30]That is a five spot from Chunky Baloney.
[12:21.58]I got one.
[12:22.16]I got one!
[12:24.89]Thanks a lot, man.
[12:27.37]Your hair smells.
[12:29.45]My whole body smells.
[12:32.31]Like, what are you talking about?
[12:37.98]No, no, I mean, not right now.
[12:40.16]Hold on a second.
[12:40.86]I'm supposed to be tweeting out the stream.
[12:46.96]Jackbox5.
[12:53.91]And then after the stream... Hold on.
[13:02.56]Jackbox5.
[13:03.04]See, now I tweeted it out.
[13:05.40]Now everyone can turn their lives, you know what I'm saying?
[13:11.34]Describe the smell.
[13:18.11]Cinnamon.
[13:23.57]Jade.
[13:25.48]Cinnamon and jade.
[13:27.98]Clean cinnamon jade laundry.
[13:29.68]There you go.
[13:30.84]Alright, this needs to be... Right, audience is on.
[13:37.88]Require Twitch, right?
[13:39.40]That's important.
[13:41.64]Post game sharing.
[13:43.85]I don't think I want to even do that.
[13:46.83]Hide gibberish.
[13:47.59]I would have to delete my Twitch channel if that were the case.
[13:51.35]Allow room hiding.
[13:52.79]Yep.
[13:54.05]Allow room code to be hidden to prevent players from joining early.
[13:56.99]Recommend it if you're streaming the game.
[13:58.41]Yes.
[13:59.23]Max players.
[14:00.49]Eight.
[14:01.97]Sounds about right.
[14:04.87]Sounds about right.
[14:07.03]Let's scroll up a little bit here.
[14:09.13]Okay.
[14:09.31]Okay.
[14:10.09]Alright.
[14:11.23]I think that's good.
[14:13.67]Make the game loud.
[14:14.91]Oh, no.
[14:15.78]That was them just... Alright.
[14:16.54]Here we go.
[14:16.90]So, programmatically generated content.
[14:22.26]I think I'm gonna... I think I'm ready.
[14:25.91]So how Jackbox works, if you haven't played it, they'll tell you.
[14:28.03]What does that mean?
[14:28.61]So you go to jackbox.TV.
[14:29.65]And once you're in jackbox.TV, you're going to get a room code.
[14:32.15]If you're in the sub-Discord...
[14:55.13]It's gonna show up there in just a moment.
[14:56.75]What's the matter, Mark?
[14:58.05]I'm trying to find my blood type, but these medical forms are just so complicated.
[15:02.62]Never mind.
[15:05.42]Not for this first game, by the way.
[15:06.98]No, just send all your information to Binge Pipe, and they'll find
[15:11.46]Well, not for the first one.
[15:12.89]Hey, come on in, everybody.
[15:14.81]Welcome to the first game.
[15:16.09]Yeah.
[15:16.73]History, credit card details, voting record, deepest fears, food allergies, romantic preferences, and lucky numbers.
[15:22.89]And they'll sort through it to find the data I need and keep the leftover details for themselves.
[15:27.46]Wow, that sounds great.
[15:29.48]Looks like I won't need this paperwork.
[15:31.90]And with the extra time, we can get dinner.
[15:33.72]Whatever.
[15:34.40]Do you like burritos?
[15:35.91]I don't know.
[15:36.79]I'll have to ask Binge Pipe.
[15:39.83]Sorry.
[15:41.09]Sorry.
[15:42.03]We'll do it again.
[15:42.71]Go to... Whatever.
[15:43.03]We're going to be here for like four or five hours.
[15:45.44]It's okay.
[15:45.72]Go to jackbox.TV, put in H-Z-N-E.
[15:47.02]You'll be able to participate as the audience.
[15:48.36]H-Z-N-E.
[15:48.60]Hmm.
[16:08.34]Yeah, I wanted a mod or two to play the first game and then I was gonna put it in the sub Discord and then I accidentally pressed that button.
[16:13.83]And now, you saw what happened.
[16:14.71]I felt that was going to happen.
[16:15.67]I'm in the room, what are you talking about?
[16:16.63]I'm in the sub Discord right now.
[16:36.17]Alright, so everybody's in.
[16:37.63]Press everybody's in to start.
[16:39.25]Press everybody's in.
[16:40.10]Do I have to join?
[16:41.24]No, wait, what?
[16:41.92]Do I have to do that?
[16:43.08]$50.
[16:43.12]$50. $50.
[17:06.34]Alright.
[17:07.29]I'm Cookie Masterson, and I have no idea why they call him... Cookie?
[17:10.42]Cookie CRM just gave $50.
[17:11.52]What do you mean I'm not in the game?
[17:15.26]That reminds me of my childhood dog, because he also ate people.
[17:19.64]What?
[17:19.84]Specifically my... I don't... It doesn't automatically put me in because I'm the host?
[17:24.01]Yeah, he ate a finger.
[17:26.01]I have to go on my phone?
[17:27.77]What?
[17:28.39]I was the host of the game.
[17:38.45]I have to... Oh, fuck me.
[17:42.73]I have to be in the browser.
[17:44.09]I thought... I haven't played in like two years.
[17:46.56]Whatever.
[17:46.96]I'm not even in the audience.
[17:50.08]I gotta join the audience.
[17:53.20]No!
[17:53.28]No, I'm turning this off.
[17:54.92]I can't fucking believe I'm about to do this.
[17:56.24]What was the room code?
[17:56.94]H-Z-H-N?
[17:57.12]What's the room code?
[17:57.76]H-Z-N-E.
[17:57.94]Enter your name.
[17:58.50]Bill!
[18:22.29]Okay, I'm ready.
[18:26.74]I'm in the audience.
[18:27.94]Alright, so... It's a Septillioner, yeah.
[18:42.19]A quintillion has 18 zeros and consequently six commas to go along with it.
[18:49.86]I need to like stop.
[18:51.34]No, this is funny.
[18:52.58]This is cool.
[18:53.28]I want to participate.
[18:54.70]I mean, I would keep all my money, of course, but the poor can have half the punctuation.
[18:58.68]Can I participate?
[18:59.50]I can't, I can't.
[19:08.50]Alright, I run the server here.
[19:09.94]After this question, I'm gonna start over.
[19:14.31]Everyone's gonna be mad.
[19:15.19]I'm gonna disconnect everybody.
[19:16.83]I'm the server.
[19:18.19]I'm just hosting this for people.
[19:19.19]I don't know.
[19:32.49]Fucking damn it, man.
[19:33.95]Right at the very beginning, too.
[19:35.15]How could I possibly screw it up?
[19:37.45]But, um, Cookie... Okay, what'd you pick?
[19:45.39]You did a bad job.
[19:47.25]Ooh, you did a bad job.
[19:49.54]Well, now we can correct our mistake from the beginning.
[19:54.30]Now when you run into...
[19:58.57]I just spit all over my fucking screen.
[20:02.39]God fucking damn it.
[20:03.91]I'm so upset right now.
[20:05.15]You have no idea how mad I am.
[20:07.80]Not at the... I mean, whatever.
[20:08.86]I screwed up.
[20:09.34]I spit all... This is a new monitor.
[20:10.72]This is new monitors in front of me.
[20:17.72]Alright, so this time... First of all, Cookie has given $100.
[20:22.86]Cookie says, Jerma, we know you screwed up.
[20:24.58]It's okay.
[20:25.14]We love you.
[20:25.70]Anyways, big hearts all around.
[20:26.88]Have some more money.
[20:28.55]Cutie.
[20:29.39]Thank you.
[20:31.03]Thank you.
[20:33.07]Thank you.
[20:36.29]Thanks a lot, Cookie.
[20:38.33]Let's go back in.
[20:39.61]I'm not going to fuck this up again.
[20:40.75]I'm the goddamn host of the game.
[20:43.95]We're getting a chance.
[20:45.33]I do want to mod in because it's fun.
[20:47.53]For the first game, we're going to have mods.
[20:50.17]Right?
[20:50.95]Right.
[20:52.63]Like, I'm gonna put, like, a weird body slider in and, like, pull his eyebrows off.
[20:57.59]Okay, don't show the fucking room code.
[20:59.27]Okay.
[20:59.49]Turn that off.
[21:00.13]Oh, okay.
[21:00.43]Here we go.
[21:01.01]Okay.
[21:01.29]That's that.
[21:02.15]Let's make sure we get... I have to go in, too.
[21:05.49]That's very important.
[21:24.60]I almost did it again.
[21:25.64]I can make sure I get it right.
[21:27.70]I almost just said the name of the room out loud.
[21:29.31]Requires Twitch to log in.
[21:30.41]I have Twitch.
[21:43.82]Hold on, I gotta like open up another fucking browser.
[21:46.30]What?
[21:46.42]What's the fucking code?
[21:47.40]Thank you, BingePipe.
[21:48.10]Thank you, BingePipe.
[21:48.78]Thank you, BingePipe.
[21:50.22]BingePipe.
[22:05.73]What do you mean?
[22:06.13]I am logged in.
[22:06.75]Twitch.
[22:07.17]Am I in?
[22:07.35]I'm in.
[22:08.47]I'm in.
[22:09.41]I'm in as Twitch.
[22:10.11]Alright, I'm in as Twitch.
[22:11.09]Alright, here we go.
[22:26.33]Step out and then back in.
[22:27.51]I'm in Twitch.
[22:28.29]I'm in.
[22:28.53]Or is it just me?
[22:30.16]Alright, let's put this into the sub-Discord.
[22:32.28]Good luck, everybody.
[22:33.04]And we are full.
[22:39.36]Welcome, everybody.
[22:40.46]Thanks for playing.
[22:42.42]Here we are.
[22:42.82]Don't say any fucking bad words.
[22:45.48]Alright, everybody's in.
[22:51.50]Sit back and relax.
[22:52.86]I'm in.
[22:53.40]Everybody's in, right?
[22:55.84]That's me, right?
[22:56.62]That's not like another person?
[22:57.46]How do I get this back over here?
[23:07.23]Alright, we can play now.
[23:08.13]Finally.
[23:08.53]I'm Cookie Masterson, and if my mom could see me now, I'd say, What are you doing, Mom?
[23:12.78]I told you to stay in the car while I hosted this game.
[23:16.48]Everyone in?
[23:17.58]I didn't think you knew this many people.
[23:19.58]And I see we've got some gawkers in the audience, which means they'll be adding an audience bonus to every question.
[23:27.15]And then we've got a bunch of other random people.
[23:30.25]But, if the audience really tanks it, that right answer is going to be worth big bucks.
[23:36.66]Alright, now we start for real.
[23:38.79]Thanks for hanging out.
[23:39.92]Thanks for being so patient.
[23:41.44]Thanks for being so patient, guys.
[23:46.39]First question.
[23:47.24]Alright.
[23:47.80]Remember Cheers?
[23:49.28]I do.
[23:50.12]If after taking a sociology class, Diane convinced the patrons of Cheers to start calling Norm one of the four types of cultural norms, what would they not shout as he walked through the door?
[24:00.78]Folkways!
[24:02.64]Folkways!
[24:04.07]Ethics!
[24:05.09]Or taboos!
[24:07.87]So hold on a second.
[24:09.31]If after taking a sociology class... That's not even a... This is even a question.
[24:14.65]This is not even a real question.
[24:20.89]I mean, I know the answer, but that, what kind of question is that?
[24:23.61]Can't do anything right, can you?
[24:26.91]Mori's, Folkways, Tetons, and laws are four cultural norms.
[24:31.07]Ethics can only help shape norms.
[24:34.92]Although drinking 12 beers a night also has an effect on the shape of norms.
[24:39.90]And how would our lovely audience do?
[24:42.64]Oh, just what I look for in an audience.
[24:45.30]25% correct.
[24:46.10]That means that right answer is worth even more.
[24:48.23]700 of you.
[24:49.11]You can thank me later.
[24:52.90]Alright, here we go.
[24:53.50]No, I don't want another question.
[24:57.48]I want one of these weird things.
[24:59.04]How is this not safe for work?
[25:00.06]Wasn't this one the not safe for work one?
[25:12.77]If the Musketeer left out of the umbrella term Three Musketeers, angrily trademarked their own candy bar, what could they call it?
[25:20.46]What could they call it?
[25:21.02]Lumiere's Nut Log, the Porto's Peanut Chew, Maurice's Milky Way, or D'Artagnan's Date Bar?
[25:30.90]What?
[25:37.27]I don't... I don't... These are like computer-generated Google questions that an AI decided.
[25:44.11]...will never go near something called Lumiere's nut log.
[25:47.12]Oh, what not safer work!
[25:51.16]...the three musketeers, but he spends the whole book as musketeer number four.
[25:58.92]It's alright, I got $744.
[25:59.68]Alright, super hot aliens.
[26:00.48]I got it right, 35%.
[26:00.92]Wow, how do we get to do these cool ones down here?
[26:21.69]Dis or dat?
[26:22.39]I'm gonna list seven things, and for each one, you tell me if it's something that happened to Paddington Bear in the delightful family film Paddington 2, something that happened to rapper Lil Wayne in real life, or both.
[26:37.36]Don't think too hard.
[26:38.10]What do you mean, both?
[26:38.76]I'm only giving you a few seconds to decide between Paddington... Spoilers for Paddington Bear!
[26:45.81]And you're all doing this together, so... Okay, let's do it.
[26:51.18]No, I don't want to see that.
[26:52.54]Born in New Orleans.
[26:54.08]Um... I don't know.
[26:56.40]I... Yeah.
[26:58.54]Uh... No!
[26:59.50]I don't know.
[27:06.08]It could be both.
[27:08.05]Worked... Was Paddington Bear a window cleaner?
[27:12.49]He was!
[27:15.23]Uh, this has got to be some story where Paddington Bear... Oh, shit, I didn't answer.
[27:21.15]Why would... Paddington Bear is not a human being, so... No.
[27:28.96]That's Paddington Bear.
[27:33.04]That's Paddington Bear.
[27:33.88]That's not Lil Wayne.
[27:38.48]I don't think Lil Wayne was ever in a coma.
[27:42.40]What?
[27:42.64]When was Lil Wayne in a coma?
[27:44.72]You can't spell disastrous without us.
[27:47.66]But you, Jesus.
[27:48.56]What?
[27:48.70]He was?
[27:49.34]You just plain sucked at that dis or dat.
[27:52.89]Holy shit.
[27:53.67]Binge pipe customer retention protocol has been activated.
[27:57.24]This is too much.
[27:58.92]This is like an ADHD computer.
[28:24.72]The question that doesn't care.
[28:26.51]See, but that sentence is hurting me.
[28:28.55]Dolph Lundgren is the guy from Rocky.
[28:30.87]No, that's not him.
[28:51.38]Uh, I don't know.
[28:52.82]Oh, I just gave everybody an answer.
[28:57.96]Dolph Lundgren did not found Ikea.
[29:01.53]No, wait, Dolph Lundgren is the WWE guy.
[29:03.05]Oh, no, that's another Dolph.
[29:07.07]I'm sure that's not a bad sign.
[29:22.84]Ugh.
[29:25.70]What is sex?
[29:26.44]Oh, that's why you can't join it.
[29:27.16]Bob's house.
[29:27.52]Method by a mile.
[29:28.42]What?
[29:28.66]Oh, he made it harder.
[29:29.36]I don't understand.
[29:30.76]They just made it hard to read?
[29:53.90]No, I just picked the wrong one because I got screwed.
[29:57.12]I just picked the wrong one.
[30:05.50]It's incorrect on this side.
[30:06.86]Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity.
[30:14.23]That's the whole point.
[30:16.29]Yeah, well, why are we giving people in Jack Puck's party pack...
[30:22.74]The blue turtle shell from Mario Kart is trivia questions, man.
[30:25.97]Currently player four is in the lead.
[30:34.75]Alright, Josephilia, doing alright.
[30:36.46]And as a counterpoint, these players are making everyone feel bad.
[30:40.56]So here come the screws.
[30:42.32]And don't forget, round two screws are more powerful.
[30:45.62]And they'll net you more cash for each player that gets the question wrong.
[30:49.18]So don't be afraid to use them.
[30:50.60]The rest of you better answer quick or you'll end up screwed.
[30:53.46]Oh, and remember, questions are worth twice as much.
[30:57.41]Oh, +2?
[30:57.81]What are you trying to say?
[30:58.59]Just wonderful, Cookie.
[31:00.17]Six trombones is none of our business.
[31:05.78]More levels of hell or seasons of entourage?
[31:08.12]What the fuck?
[31:09.26]I'm just trying to answer the question!
[31:11.88]What did the- been to the password?
[31:13.80]We have to put a password in!
[31:15.45]What?
[31:37.96]Did I get it?
[31:39.44]Wrong password.
[31:44.68]I can't even type the password in right!
[31:46.38]I did type the phrase, and I couldn't get it.
[31:48.30]What is entourage?
[32:03.86]It's when Mark Wahlberg showed on camera how cool his life is.
[32:14.32]That's the whole show.
[32:16.18]That's actually the entire show.
[32:18.86]There's nothing else to that show besides Mark Wahlberg has a really cool life.
[32:22.39]That's it.
[32:27.30]Spoilers.
[32:27.68]What?
[32:27.86]What is on Scooby Doo's collar?
[32:29.70]I think it's... It has his initials on it.
[32:31.56]STOP GIVING PEOPLE ANSWERS!
[33:02.13]Scooby-Doo's color tag is in place with his big gold initials, SD.
[33:09.32]Yo, congratulations, everybody.
[33:17.02]Player's choice now offers content surveys.
[33:20.18]What does that mean?
[33:21.38]Would you like an attractive question or a question with a great sense of humor?
[33:25.82]Use your device to select your preference.
[33:28.87]Uh, I'm going to say... Well, I'm not going to tell you who I vote for.
[33:31.90]Because that would be against... You know, I'm going in there and I don't want you to know.
[33:43.08]What was I doing?
[33:43.74]Oh yeah, I didn't turn my lights on.
[33:45.27]It's dark in here.
[33:46.97]It's dark in this room.
[33:48.11]There we go.
[33:48.83]Nice.
[33:49.87]Wait, why didn't that not work?
[33:50.65]What a great sense of humor.
[33:59.67]Up next, a question with a great sense of humor.
[34:02.96]I voted for this.
[34:04.50]I know this.
[34:04.86]I know this.
[34:05.44]I know this.
[34:05.70]I would say it right now, but you guys would all hear me.
[34:31.16]I love this part.
[34:34.02]See, phlegm is one of them, blood is one of them.
[34:36.86]The humors were believed to be blood, phlegm, black bile, and the fourth was yellow bile.
[34:44.93]Got some smart people here.
[34:46.39]Yes, there were two biles.
[34:48.05]Just like modern humor, the Greeks... Oh, Cheeto!
[34:51.21]Cheeto's confirmed for Smash Brothers!
[34:58.64]Behold a community first a business second who wrote that track What is it I could do without these splash screens in Polaris and Vega we thought you'd like Dancing with the Stars RuPaul's Drag Race Shark Tank or Duck Dynasty Polaris and Vega
[35:26.27]I don't know what it's even asking us.
[35:27.85]I'm gonna pick this one.
[35:32.78]I'm gonna go with that one.
[35:37.18]Because that would make the most sense to me.
[35:39.28]Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
[35:40.57]Ooh, minus 2,000.
[35:43.05]Yeah, those are stars.
[35:43.77]Those are stars.
[35:48.43]Dancing with Polaris.
[35:49.92]Dancing with Vega.
[35:50.96]You know what I'm saying?
[35:52.84]The YouTube joke.
[35:53.54]I hate to tell you, Jack.
[35:54.26]There's an entire group.
[36:03.92]Wasn't there an entire YouTube group that was called Polaris?
[36:06.72]It was like 5,000 YouTubers.
[36:07.34]So, you were right.
[36:08.05]Who offers the most stable relationship?
[36:09.57]No.
[36:09.71]No.
[36:09.81]No.
[36:09.93]I know this one.
[36:30.91]Are we in emote-only mode because of, uh, answers?
[36:37.94]It's not the rhombus?
[36:39.50]The rhombus has, like, the legs and the... No, it's not.
[36:41.52]That's bullshit.
[36:42.38]The rhombus has the frayed-out bottom.
[36:44.66]They did that because they wanted to make a pizza reference.
[37:02.53]Pizza should be cut into rhombus shapes.
[37:05.27]You made it to the attack.
[37:07.47]When you see an answer that matches the category, tap it on your device.
[37:12.09]The faster you pick up an answer, the more cash you make.
[37:15.23]Oh, Elmo, the latest Avenger.
[37:17.69]Each time you're wrong, I'm taking some cash away.
[37:21.49]And be careful.
[37:22.88]Alright, what are we doing?
[37:24.25]Hey, uh... What's screaming at me?
[37:26.01]Why are you screaming at me?
[37:26.83]Huh?
[37:27.75]What?
[37:28.17]I have to scroll down here.
[37:30.17]Um...
[37:53.41]I think I did it.
[38:02.89]Oh, and we're still going.
[38:03.73]I'm like being quiet.
[38:08.15]I don't know.
[38:08.57]I don't understand.
[38:10.75]That's not it?
[38:13.28]I thought that was it and we're still going.
[38:23.59]No, no, no.
[38:28.53]This is very, very odd.
[38:30.15]What?
[38:30.39]How is that?
[38:30.91]How is a laser not energy?
[38:33.98]The laser isn't energy, guys.
[38:43.18]Oh...
[38:44.81]What?
[38:45.01]They come in in secret!
[38:47.03]No!
[38:49.51]No, they don't.
[38:51.37]No, they don't.
[38:52.45]They, uh, I got it wrong.
[39:00.23]No, they don't, like, sneak in.
[39:06.37]I have to, it has to be, to match up with...
[39:23.24]No, I don't... M.A.S.H.
[39:25.82]That was a... M.A.S.H.
[39:27.20]was a show about medicine.
[39:30.64]What?
[39:32.90]What?
[39:33.08]It's a show about absurd medical people and... What?
[39:41.09]It wasn't a show about a... It wasn't medical at all, apparently.
[39:44.07]M.A.S.H.
[39:44.39]was not a medical show.
[39:50.16]Player four wins!
[39:54.54]Nice work, player four.
[39:56.22]Try to enjoy this fleeting moment of glory before you remember.
[39:59.95]You don't know Jack!
[40:07.63]At least I have $587.
[40:08.29]Alright.
[40:09.01]Thanks for playing, guys.
[40:16.32]Alright, so one, two, three, four.
[40:20.69]Remember these names, because we want new players!
[40:22.68]New players.
[40:23.18]I don't want to play this one, though.
[40:29.74]Alright, now we're going to go to... We're just going to go down in order.
[40:36.84]I'm going to go split the room.
[40:39.04]The what-if game, where anything is possible creates strange and divisive hypothetical situations.
[40:48.34]Cool.
[40:51.45]I'm looking forward to this one.
[40:53.29]Let's get the settings right here.
[40:56.63]Audience is enabled.
[40:57.77]Yeah, make sure the other stuff is as well.
[41:01.54]Require Twitch.
[41:02.40]Yes, please.
[41:04.12]Allows the first player in to censor players' answers.
[41:07.00]Uh-huh.
[41:09.42]Yep.
[41:11.43]Post-game sharing.
[41:12.65]Allow room code hiding.
[41:14.25]And eight players.
[41:16.81]Extended timers.
[41:21.47]Oh, it says recommended for streamed games.
[41:23.57]Okay.
[41:27.33]No, I'm not... I want to be able to censor answers, because what if they're bad?
[41:32.44]Okay.
[41:33.66]Turn down the host if you want to be confused and lonely.
[41:36.22]So that looks good.
[41:39.22]I got room hiding on.
[41:41.78]Right?
[41:42.52]Yes.
[41:42.98]Okay.
[41:44.70]Time to play.
[41:46.20]Same deal as last time.
[41:48.68]Uh...
[41:50.95]Here, this time, no mods on this one.
[41:55.04]I'm going to deuce the sub game.
[41:56.56]Let me just make sure I don't show this on stream yet.
[42:03.84]Join us.
[42:05.70]Alright, good luck.
[42:07.82]If you already played, then we will have to get rid of you if you come to this one.
[42:15.17]So, good luck.
[42:20.64]Okay.
[42:21.86]Looks pretty good.
[42:23.86]Looks like we got some new people.
[42:31.65]Right?
[42:31.91]I don't see any familiar names here.
[42:34.80]Come on in.
[42:41.60]If they can change their names, well, they have to be linked to Twitch.
[42:45.20]You have to have your Twitch linked.
[42:46.22]God damn it!
[43:14.39]I'm just like putting the code over here and... Oh, fuck me.
[43:19.11]Honest to God.
[43:21.09]There's room for more.
[43:33.29]Fucking Jesus.
[43:38.39]Join the party.
[43:40.39]Sorry, I'm sorry, everybody.
[43:42.33]Like, I just... My brain is like in three different places.
[43:56.76]Okay, I'm in.
[43:58.02]I'm in this one.
[44:01.66]Mother of fucking god.
[44:08.59]Come on in.
[44:11.06]I'm sorry to the people that got in before.
[44:13.28]That's my fault.
[44:13.98]I'm sorry.
[44:16.76]Takes me three tries to learn.
[44:19.12]I have to fall down on the bike three fucking times before I realize I have to pedal the bike.
[44:22.82]You know what I mean?
[44:23.30]Like, give me a break.
[44:26.92]Mom, I don't understand.
[44:28.14]I fell down on the bike twice.
[44:30.67]You have to pedal, Jeremy.
[44:32.97]Oh.
[44:34.19]Oh, right.
[44:34.77]Okay.
[44:39.66]I'm sorry, guys.
[44:40.60]Seriously.
[44:46.33]But I think everyone's in.
[44:47.65]Let's go.
[44:51.44]Not if you start on a hill.
[44:52.58]God damn it.
[44:55.45]Fuck.
[44:55.63]I'm so embarrassed.
[44:56.81]I really am.
[44:57.81]I'm embarrassed right now.
[44:58.87]Okay.
[44:59.09]Okay.
[45:20.67]is life better there are infinite possibilities you could write into complete that's kind of funny choose wisely though because everybody else will then answer yes or no
[45:34.10]And you will earn more points if you split the room.
[45:37.54]Fitting name, huh?
[45:38.90]For those of you in the audience, you'll be competing as one player.
[45:42.30]Your answers will be determined by a majority vote.
[45:45.42]Yes, even in a nebulous void, democracy is important.
[45:49.48]Yes, you do not need the game to play.
[45:51.64]You just need to go to the browser.
[45:55.08]Got it?
[45:55.74]Good.
[45:56.44]Now let's begin.
[45:58.69]You don't have to have the game.
[46:00.45]You just have to have a browser on a tablet, phone, browser.
[46:02.85]What?
[46:02.97]Complete the scenario.
[46:03.49]Do I try to read this?
[46:04.23]I don't think I should read this.
[46:28.84]Okay, I'm not going to read this.
[46:32.56]I have to read it out loud, though, or I won't understand.
[46:34.79]Okay, I got it.
[46:41.71]I got it.
[46:51.00]That's from Undertale.
[46:52.80]That's from Undertale.
[46:54.20]That's the flower from Undertale.
[47:06.74]Okay.
[47:10.56]Now we're just waiting for the vote.
[47:15.19]And we're gonna see why it was a good idea to add the extended timers.
[47:20.57]There it is, 30 seconds.
[47:31.72]Okay.
[47:32.00]Split the room.
[47:35.43]Chapter 1 of 9.
[47:36.05]Oh!
[47:36.11]Uh... The government has just outlawed me.
[47:38.03]A friend introduces you to the black market.
[47:41.27]Do you risk significant jail time in order to get to be able to watch the stream?
[48:05.94]I mean, I don't want to influence this vote or anything, but... I mean, unless I'm... No, I'm not going to influence the vote.
[48:17.67]I'll take one Jerma, please.
[48:22.49]On one hand, though, I mean... Maybe if I was made out of gold.
[48:27.66]Right?
[48:28.50]Not currently, but maybe you'd really enjoy the stream.
[48:31.22]But I'm not made out of gold, so...
[48:43.72]The longer it takes the room to answer, the more bonus points you get.
[48:46.82]I'm the only one that said no.
[48:52.02]What about you guys?
[48:52.88]Did we split the room?
[48:54.44]Purchaser, beware.
[48:56.14]What?
[48:57.86]You just found your dream house, and it's super affordable.
[49:00.65]However, you discover it's so cheap because there's this.
[49:05.51]In the basement, do you buy the house?
[49:22.17]You buy the house?
[49:23.29]You just found your dream house, super affordable, hopefully you discover it's cheap because the flower from Undertale is in the basement.
[49:27.65]Are you still going to buy it?
[49:31.27]Then on one hand, you're going to have a really cool adventure probably.
[49:34.39]You're going to meet some characters.
[49:38.51]Have fun with your new friend Sans from Undertale.
[49:43.61]On the other hand though, you just want to live in a house and it's not worth it.
[49:47.21]Even if it's cheap, just go next door.
[49:48.95]You don't have to worry about it.
[49:59.57]There we go, Andy!
[50:02.86]Split the room!
[50:05.02]I split the room!
[50:14.51]Brace yourself for... The Compliment Bible.
[50:19.75]I said that loud loud and I typed it.
[50:20.51]Okay.
[50:20.61]It's a nice book.
[50:20.95]Looking at... Is a book full of every nice thing anyone has ever said about you?
[50:23.00]I don't want to know that.
[50:24.18]For every minute you spend looking at... I mean, that's...
[50:50.75]I mean, I don't wanna... Why would you want a book that has everything that someone said about you nice?
[50:56.61]You know what I mean?
[50:57.05]Like, if you open it up, you're gonna start to pretty much think about what they're saying.
[51:03.08]Oh, wow, I really think Jeremy's hair is so nice.
[51:06.46]I really hope he doesn't cut his hair ever.
[51:08.94]It's the nicest hair.
[51:09.80]Oh, Jeremy's hair is so nice.
[51:11.04]It's like, I can't cut my hair ever again.
[51:14.31]What if I get a haircut, like a short haircut, and then that person is not in the book anymore?
[51:18.23]I'm flipping through, freaking out, like, wait, wait, no one's talking about the hair anymore.
[51:21.46]They hate it.
[51:29.26]You wouldn't see the, yo, because it would disappear, because it would be gone, because that person wouldn't write it.
[51:32.54]It said yes.
[51:40.65]I'm trying to work the room, don't you understand?
[51:42.91]Five bucks an hour.
[51:43.53]Okay.
[51:43.73]So for five dollars an hour, you can hire- I could hire an impersonator to stream for me.
[51:46.51]Everyone will just think it's me.
[51:47.73]Their work is very good, but they have one- they dab spontaneously.
[52:12.47]Here's one I like to call shelf help.
[52:17.69]You're somebody who feels lost in life.
[52:20.03]One day you stumble upon a self-help book at a store.
[52:22.79]You open it and immediately find answers to your life.
[52:25.49]When you flip to the cover, you notice it was written by this person.
[52:29.25]Do you buy it?
[52:33.46]You're somebody who feels lost in life.
[52:35.06]One day you stumble upon a self-help book at a store.
[52:36.88]You open it and immediately find answers to your life.
[52:38.70]You flip over the cover, you notice it was written by you.
[52:40.96]Do you buy it?
[52:46.72]I mean, that is a cursed object, yeah.
[52:50.28]But why is it cursed?
[52:51.33]Are you going to put it back?
[52:53.85]Don't you want to know?
[52:56.13]On the other end, opening that book could change the course of your entire life, right?
[53:03.90]And maybe just picking it up and putting it back is enough for you to understand that, holy shit, there's some things that I'm going to have to do some stuff, you know what I mean?
[53:24.66]I would buy it.
[53:25.20]I would fucking buy it.
[53:26.38]Are you kidding me?
[53:31.16]Chunky baloney would not buy it.
[53:32.88]I wouldn't want to read that in a dark room.
[53:39.44]Where nobody could see me.
[53:41.51]Nobody knows what I'm doing.
[53:42.21]What?
[53:52.92]Your hometown wants to build a statue of you in your honor.
[53:57.96]It has a unique donor group.
[53:59.96]The plaque will read that the moment was paid by tax dodgers.
[54:02.81]Do you let them build it?
[54:10.45]Well, okay, so you get one hand.
[54:12.21]I don't want to be associated with, like, tax dodgers, right?
[54:16.78]That's not a good thing.
[54:19.36]But does the monument go up if, you know, is that... I don't...
[54:29.94]Whoa, hold on a minute here.
[54:32.00]It's kind of split.
[54:41.52]I got a perfect split.
[54:44.02]Justice can see.
[54:47.42]You've been accused of a crime you didn't commit.
[54:49.62]A pro bono lawyer reaches out to represent you.
[54:52.33]This individual is intelligent and has a lot of experience.
[54:55.17]However, they just so happen to be this.
[54:58.77]Do you let this person represent you?
[55:14.06]What?
[55:14.70]Are they a lawyer?
[55:21.22]Am I going to get... There's no part two to this.
[55:23.97]You know what I'm saying?
[55:30.65]For free.
[55:32.01]Intelligent has a lot of experience.
[55:34.38]They're just sans.
[55:35.84]That's the second Undertale reference, and I don't even fucking play that game.
[55:42.58]I played Undertale three years ago, and then I played Deltarune.
[55:47.89]It's not something we talk about all the time.
[55:50.03]Why are we getting all these Undertale references?
[55:59.36]He literally just played Deltarune.
[56:01.48]Yeah, but like, yeah, he was in the Rumble.
[56:04.14]Yeah, he was.
[56:05.90]Feast your eyes on.
[56:08.04]You must be this tall to vote.
[56:11.00]Oh, I wonder how funny this one's gonna be.
[56:14.08]Before you are considered eligible to vote, you must do this.
[56:18.48]There's an actual dog on this year's ballot that is close to being elected.
[56:22.18]Do you step up and vote?
[56:27.95]Uh...
[56:31.49]Before you're considered eligible, you get a free iPod.
[56:43.48]That's it.
[56:51.52]Who doesn't want a free iPod with no strings attached?
[56:56.39]Oh, hey, welcome to the polls.
[56:58.41]Yeah.
[56:59.37]Here's a free iPod for showing up.
[57:03.53]Actually, that would be... I actually wouldn't... No, can I change my answer?
[57:07.07]I wouldn't want to go.
[57:07.59]That would be insane.
[57:09.34]That would cause a fucking riot.
[57:11.64]Free iPods to everybody?
[57:14.18]It'd be like Black Friday.
[57:17.50]Why did I say yes?
[57:26.45]Alright, here's the last one.
[57:28.69]Okay, yeah.
[57:29.29]Sure.
[57:29.83]Having a fist... Oh, man.
[58:08.39]But what is that?
[58:09.65]What is that?
[58:21.41]What is it?
[58:31.08]It's mystery, but what if mystery is... It could, yeah, but like, no, I don't know what it is.
[58:40.53]If mystery meat could be like vegan hot dogs, right?
[58:46.63]Technically.
[58:47.11]Here's where everybody stacks up at the moment.
[58:52.26]How we doing?
[58:52.62]How we doing?
[58:52.94]How we doing?
[58:58.55]First place.
[58:59.15]First place.
[58:59.81]Okay.
[58:59.95]Chat second place.
[59:01.08]Oh, shit.
[59:01.28]Okay.
[59:01.40]I'm ready.
[59:01.66]Okay.
[59:29.51]Okay, I got it.
[59:30.53]Ooh, okay.
[59:41.28]Ooh!
[59:44.62]Hmm, I gotta think something good for this one.
[59:46.34]Ugh!
[59:53.85]Ugh!
[60:00.10]Oh, this is so fucking hard
[60:37.60]I'm ready!
[60:51.34]It's almost starting.
[60:51.88]I almost got the fire.
[60:54.44]Almost got the fire.
[60:56.96]It's starting.
[60:59.14]Oh, fuck.
[60:59.52]Why'd I start a fire in my room?
[61:02.05]Why am I so excited right now?
[61:03.15]I don't know why.
[61:07.96]Roar.
[61:09.78]You have to pick your forever home.
[61:11.58]You're down to two options.
[61:13.04]One has doorways that are only five feet tall and the other has this.
[61:17.45]Which apartment floor do you settle for?
[61:19.35]Carpet is kitchen.
[61:43.02]Imagine fucking building a carpeted kitchen.
[61:44.16]Which apartment do you settle for?
[61:45.12]God!
[61:45.26]No, my lord!
[62:08.97]If you didn't have any sinks, what the hell would you do?
[62:10.95]How are you gonna wash your hands?
[62:12.62]Are you gonna wash your hands in the bathtub?
[62:14.26]You're gonna do dishes in the bathtub?
[62:20.64]Oh.
[62:20.96]Well.
[62:21.06]Never mind.
[62:35.67]Oh, what do you settle for?
[62:37.37]Doorways only five feet tall or a dad in the walls.
[62:49.83]Five foot tall doorways really are fucking... that sucks.
[62:54.70]That really sucks.
[62:57.16]Got the correct prediction, too.
[63:01.50]Let's switch things up.
[63:03.67]You and four other patrons at a buffet restaurant are being held captive.
[63:06.81]At a buffet?
[63:07.41]If you eat everything that's left in an hour, you'll be let go.
[63:10.21]You can either drink a gallon of gravy or this food.
[63:13.53]Which food do you want for your life?
[63:16.53]Nobody can drink a gallon of gravy.
[63:24.43]A gallon of gravy with 10 pounds of mashed potatoes.
[63:31.01]No, I...
[63:35.24]You can't physically eat 10 pounds of mashed potatoes.
[63:41.00]You'll die.
[63:42.71]You'll die if you eat this.
[63:52.63]You don't know me.
[63:54.69]You die.
[63:58.59]I picked that in a second.
[64:00.13]It took me one second to pick that.
[64:04.33]The second that door opened, it took me a second to click on the answer.
[64:12.66]Gallon gravy or a can of worms?
[64:17.10]I would eat the can of worms in a fucking second.
[64:19.66]Are you kidding me?
[64:22.70]A gallon of gravy versus just deal with just eating a can of worms and you get to leave?
[64:34.37]Who's ass?
[64:36.95]I don't understand.
[64:50.82]Does it matter?
[64:52.43]I mean, kind of.
[64:57.65]Which car?
[64:58.23]Nobody even knows what that fucking means.
[65:26.74]You know what I mean?
[65:27.46]Nobody knows what this is, so who cares?
[65:32.96]Yeah, the 4,000 people here know what that is, but if you're driving around in a rental car, you're like some random lady on a bus is gonna look over and be like, oh my god, he died to Pinwheel from Dark Souls.
[65:51.34]That's fine.
[65:57.48]It's an easy pick.
[66:01.58]The Clown Convention.
[66:09.24]Everybody... I mean, why would... who cares about the Clown Convention?
[66:19.43]Gentleman's Club or a police car with siren blazing.
[66:25.07]Which... what do you drive around in?
[66:45.12]It's an ad.
[66:45.82]That's not how it works.
[66:51.70]Ah, my stomach.
[66:54.41]I was like, instead of a rental car, whatever.
[66:58.59]Come on, I won.
[67:00.05]I won the game.
[67:01.87]I won the game.
[67:09.56]Don't stop.
[67:10.20]Get out of here.
[67:14.06]The audience got the most likes.
[67:15.32]Did you look at that?
[67:18.78]Most death likes.
[67:20.74]Oh my god.
[67:21.48]That one was kind of fun.
[67:28.94]Alright, we can play through other ones.
[67:32.96]But that one was fun.
[67:34.84]Let's go back to... Mad vs. City.
[67:44.47]This is the one coming up next.
[67:48.45]But before we do that, I've been drinking soda and coffee, and I have to pee really bad.
[67:53.10]So this is gonna be like a two-second break.
[67:56.06]I'll be right back.
[67:57.44]This is a quick just piss.
[68:00.57]Really quick.
[69:39.57]Alright, let's do this.
[69:42.11]So just quickly, we've been going for about just over an hour.
[69:45.46]I want to make sure everybody's aware of the remaining schedule for this week.
[69:51.21]So, obviously we're going to do this tonight.
[69:53.65]I don't really have like a time limit for this, or how long this is going to be.
[69:58.20]Maybe like another couple hours, few hours of this.
[70:00.38]Tomorrow, tomorrow, around the same time, maybe, I'm actually not sure.
[70:07.45]I'm going to play Red Dead Redemption 2 online with a friend or two.
[70:15.19]You'll see who.
[70:17.01]You'll see who.
[70:18.58]Spoiler alert.
[70:19.86]It's Vinny.
[70:21.14]Whoops.
[70:26.74]So I'm not sure when that's going to be starting.
[70:30.75]And maybe another one or two people too.
[70:32.69]If we can maybe find somebody that would like to play.
[70:34.53]But that's kind of what we're going to do tomorrow.
[70:38.01]I don't have a start time.
[70:39.93]But that's what's going to happen tomorrow.
[70:43.19]Unless, I mean, there could be a reason why it doesn't happen, but... Because he saw the internet, how it was kind of... The Rockstar internet servers, the Rockstar servers would fall fucked up, so... We'll see if we can even play it.
[70:59.48]And then Sunday is the movie night.
[71:01.89]The... Sunday's movie night.
[71:07.35]Submissions are closed, by the way.
[71:11.19]Just in case you were curious.
[71:14.18]They're gonna watch a bunch of random shit.
[71:16.60]So we've got three streams in a row here coming up.
[71:19.34]Including this one.
[71:22.82]So, that's the plan.
[71:24.95]That's the tentative plan.
[71:25.99]I'm gonna try Red Dead tomorrow.
[71:30.29]Let's keep going.
[71:32.07]Mad... Oh, yeah, I can do the settings in here.
[71:41.60]Alright, same deal.
[71:42.62]Audience is on.
[71:43.60]Extended timers is on.
[71:45.08]Require Twitch is on.
[71:46.46]Manual censoring is on.
[71:49.74]Hide.
[71:50.28]Allow room code hiding.
[71:53.12]Yes.
[71:53.72]Eight players.
[71:54.72]Sounds good.
[71:58.33]So, I don't know how this one works, but this is Mad vs. City.
[72:02.61]Don't forget to join.
[72:03.83]Oh, I will not forget.
[72:05.15]I'm not going to forget this time.
[72:19.45]Alright.
[72:21.55]Again, if you've already played, we will remove you if you play again.
[72:28.54]Just be aware.
[72:31.86]Come on in.
[72:32.16]I think that looks good.
[72:37.28]I think that looks okay.
[72:43.43]Don't see any of the names from previously, so sweet.
[72:48.61]Come on in, guys.
[72:52.65]What's the Discord?
[72:53.93]This will be a link.
[72:56.59]Somebody can link it.
[73:00.75]Just wait for a couple more seconds or so.
[73:15.06]So close.
[73:17.95]Here we go.
[73:18.75]I have no idea how this works, but this is a... Apparently you make lyrics.
[73:25.24]Or something like that.
[73:26.32]We'll find the fuck out.
[73:27.90]Cookie.
[73:28.76]How's it work?
[73:29.52]Never mind.
[73:46.66]Here's how you do it.
[73:47.65]We'll ask you for a word or a phrase.
[73:48.99]What's up with your... Use it to complete line one of your rap.
[73:52.43]You'll then write a line that rhymes with it.
[73:55.21]We do that about two times and you have your four line verse.
[73:59.57]What?
[73:59.85]Okay, so we have to rhyme?
[74:00.97]We vote on that winner.
[74:02.23]Which, honestly, you all are.
[74:05.36]Alright, so this is... No, no, no, no, no.
[74:08.22]They can stay.
[74:08.92]So we have to put a word?
[74:10.16]I don't care if robots destroy the city, do you?
[74:12.24]Get your words together.
[74:14.12]Time to get it started.
[74:16.61]Alright, I'm ready.
[74:17.55]God.
[74:18.69]Alright.
[74:18.91]Alright, here we go.
[74:19.49]And you're going up against somebody.
[74:20.77]Alright, I'm gonna fill this out.
[74:57.16]I've got to run a line here.
[75:14.01]Bang.
[75:14.75]Got it.
[75:22.79]Hohoho, this one is gonna light him up!
[75:25.16]Okay, here we go, another one.
[75:43.01]Uhh...
[75:51.07]Oh fuck, can I go back?
[76:04.39]Oh fuck, hold on, I got a minute, I'm fine.
[76:33.10]Okay.
[76:34.22]What is this?
[76:34.76]What's this?
[76:35.06]What's this?
[76:39.67]What?
[76:39.85]I don't understand.
[76:43.35]I guess I'm ready.
[76:46.61]Yeah, I'm ready.
[76:58.09]Okay, we're almost done.
[76:59.09]I kinda screwed up, but it's alright.
[77:07.12]Click faster!
[77:08.30]Well, I only got 20 more seconds.
[77:12.42]I'm clicking as hard as I can.
[77:13.94]I don't understand.
[77:15.24]What do you mean, click faster?
[77:16.14]Round one.
[77:16.89]Alright.
[77:28.61]I missed the Sandman versus Krawski.
[77:31.11]My talent's so big we're running out of gold.
[77:34.08]And no short streamer running in my way.
[77:36.30]I'm sold.
[77:37.14]I ain't about in it.
[77:38.02]It's the fact that I'm chatting.
[77:40.08]Posting memes, emotes, and procrastinating.
[77:46.30]You need to do something else.
[77:47.60]Don't ever think about writing ever again in life.
[77:51.99]It's time for you to answer that one.
[77:53.61]You gotta come strong, too.
[77:58.13]I got big plans.
[77:59.39]I'm a brainiac.
[78:01.11]Roses are red.
[78:02.35]Violets are blue.
[78:03.65]That's it.
[78:03.99]My lines melt on the tongue like cheeseburger.
[78:07.13]One thing's for sure.
[78:08.37]I wrote this line.
[78:10.17]Ah, fool!
[78:10.86]Get him off the stage!
[78:11.70]I'm gonna give you a pass on that, because this is your first time doing this, but don't ever come back with that whack.
[78:18.02]You know, there's another round.
[78:20.28]Right now is the time to vote.
[78:21.50]Round two.
[78:23.60]Time to vote.
[78:27.20]Well, I mean...
[78:34.14]I voted.
[78:39.43]I'm not gonna tell you who I voted for, but... Democracy fails?
[78:45.09]I don't think democracy will work out here.
[78:54.59]Let's see.
[78:56.47]Total votes, 797.
[79:00.70]71% cash.
[79:03.90]And cheer bonus.
[79:07.45]Congratulations.
[79:08.49]I wrote this line.
[79:12.09]Alright, we got Kenny versus Box Guy.
[79:17.79]Box Guy's going first.
[79:18.49]Watch me work.
[79:19.37]I'm a master stream.
[79:21.27]I came here to win, but I will lose.
[79:24.25]I'm no gangsta.
[79:25.17]I'm the original Rottweiler.
[79:26.53]In bed.
[79:35.82]People are angry.
[79:40.20]We need some heat.
[79:42.22]I'm too hot.
[79:42.90]My body's made of red hot chili peppers.
[79:45.22]I see your thoughts, and she has to help us.
[79:48.27]My mouth's like a trumpet, my brain's like a piano.
[79:51.23]My rhyme's real good, don't you know?
[79:54.83]No, you guys are gonna cheer that one?
[79:55.85]That wasn't half bad.
[79:57.93]I gotta see a little bit more though.
[79:59.81]Alright, now it's time for you to use your devices and vote.
[80:11.09]It actually kinda rhymed.
[80:12.45]Hit the voting button, pick somebody.
[80:26.08]In bed.
[80:36.13]Total vote, 783.
[80:37.49]Less people voted than last time.
[80:40.41]What happened?
[80:40.93]Victory to Kenny.
[80:44.43]Alright, let's go.
[80:44.89]I'm ready.
[80:45.59]I'm ready!
[80:55.11]Bring it on.
[80:55.83]Bring it on, Scrooge.
[80:56.78]Yeah.
[80:56.88]Oh!
[80:56.96]How am I gonna answer that one?
[80:58.96]How am I gonna beat this one?
[81:17.50]It's a showdown and my words are my laser.
[81:20.56]Electricity is a game.
[81:22.18]Hope you brought a taser.
[81:23.60]Don't look now.
[81:24.80]I stole your jelly.
[81:26.81]What did you say?
[81:27.89]Hold the jelly.
[81:31.35]I fucked it up.
[81:32.53]But the first line was fire, okay?
[81:35.21]Ding, ding.
[81:37.21]The bell has rang.
[81:38.63]Vote to see who was the dopest MC.
[81:45.71]It told me to name a place!
[81:47.69]So I said, the deli, instead of deli.
[81:49.97]So I added an extra word.
[81:51.07]That doesn't mean it wasn't fucking on, like, burning!
[82:13.18]Let's see.
[82:14.46]8.59.
[82:14.48]Oh, what?
[82:15.00]What?
[82:15.28]This one's fun.
[82:16.88]I like this one.
[82:22.82]Alright.
[82:24.10]Kaiju versus...
[82:39.78]My rhymes fly like rockets, explode like gamers.
[82:42.96]Those rockets work on to my haters.
[82:45.48]Air horning you, because you're great.
[82:51.97]You know it's your turn, Ryder.
[82:55.73]My ribs are so fresh, they smell like a croissant.
[82:58.87]The important thing is, we're all having fun.
[83:01.20]My fun food routine is brush floss and eat.
[83:05.32]Rinse and repeat.
[83:11.94]The best part about that was how it said croissant.
[83:17.01]It was like croissant.
[83:33.10]They were both good.
[83:34.44]They were both good.
[83:44.76]Oh, this one's great.
[83:48.57]I'm curious who's gonna win this one.
[83:53.67]834... I'm surprised by that.
[83:55.67]Wow.
[83:57.59]I thought it was gonna be close.
[84:00.64]That's how you say it.
[84:01.52]Oh, I know.
[84:02.02]But it's funny that the game decided to do that.
[84:08.56]Let's check the scores.
[84:11.95]Yeah, well, it's alright.
[84:14.49]Just wait till I get my hands on it next time.
[84:17.75]Now tell us where you think you're all at.
[84:19.64]Follow those instructions on your device.
[84:21.66]Okay, I'm gonna destroy this one.
[84:35.75]Uh, how do I?
[84:36.13]I don't know how to fucking... I don't know how to spell that.
[84:38.25]I gotta figure out how to spell that word.
[84:58.74]Right?
[84:58.92]Is that correct?
[84:59.36]Is that how you spell it?
[85:03.80]Yep.
[85:04.52]Okay.
[85:13.72]Oh, bingo!
[85:23.64]Oh, man.
[85:25.66]Good luck.
[85:31.62]Good luck to whoever comes up against me, that's all I gotta say.
[85:48.78]Okay, and now I need this.
[85:50.08]Okay, this is where I'm gonna bring it home, right here.
[86:22.54]Okay, here we go.
[86:53.17]And... Got it.
[87:01.64]Why can I not pick one of these?
[87:02.52]Why can I not pick one of these?
[87:07.20]Destroy... Click it!
[87:10.82]Why can I... Did I already get one?
[87:14.81]Yeah, good luck to anybody that's going up against me.
[87:16.23]I got... Good luck.
[87:20.87]I'm gonna get signed after this one.
[87:25.23]Here's the undercard and main event for round two.
[87:27.77]Somebody better come get this money.
[87:29.47]Battle of number one, battle of number two.
[87:32.31]Let's go.
[87:36.18]Bring it on.
[87:37.86]You're gonna feel me right in the medulla oblongata.
[87:40.96]You looking all angry while I sip this rum chata.
[87:44.06]Your accent above you sound just like the Beatles.
[87:47.20]You're in God's house now.
[87:48.88]Welcome to the steeple.
[87:51.74]Give me a break!
[88:02.84]Maybe you'll understand when you're shorter.
[88:05.92]You're the size of a quarter.
[88:08.38]Oh, yeah.
[88:09.12]Anyone home in there?
[88:10.77]Hey.
[88:12.31]Oh, I almost stepped on Yerma.
[88:15.19]Oh, what a great rep.
[88:18.07]God, what a great one.
[88:20.51]Come on.
[88:21.45]That was so crafted.
[88:22.17]Yeah, I might be shorter, but come on.
[88:57.28]Toad had more heart on his.
[88:58.86]That was, that was, that 60-40.
[89:03.52]Holy shit, that was closer than it should have been.
[89:07.48]It's time for our next battle.
[89:12.58]So we need the next two cats to step up and get down.
[89:16.74]Alright, Box Guy versus Mister.
[89:20.24]Right on the street is where you're full of potato.
[89:23.44]And your face is red as a tomato.
[89:26.60]Have you ever considered a career in buying a convention?
[89:29.80]My doctor says I'm rhyme intolerant.
[89:32.53]Okay.
[89:33.37]Word.
[89:35.77]Cool.
[89:36.49]Let's go.
[89:37.23]Now let's keep it moving.
[89:38.89]It's time for you to come back and show them your strength.
[89:44.18]Hold on.
[89:44.62]Now you're about to get maimed.
[89:46.14]Uh-oh.
[89:47.40]While these enemy gamers get destroyed.
[89:49.44]Uh-oh.
[89:50.66]Freight trains coming right at your toe.
[89:53.72]Real unlucky that you're my foe.
[89:56.89]That last one was alright.
[89:59.79]That last one was okay.
[90:01.11]Oh, that's tough.
[90:02.15]Find another hobby.
[90:04.02]Voting time.
[90:05.04]Right now.
[90:26.71]Well, we're all not professionals here, guys.
[90:28.71]Okay.
[90:34.97]I'm rhyme intolerant.
[90:40.48]Let's see.
[90:43.96]Wow!
[90:47.82]That's actually pretty surprising.
[90:52.38]I was under the assumption that would be pretty close.
[90:56.13]Okay, the next one.
[90:56.63]Alright, we got Kenny versus Krosky again.
[91:00.07]I'm a hurricane.
[91:01.25]You're a rain.
[91:03.12]I'm not one bling, but you're insane.
[91:06.18]Your flow's a disaster like a Category 5 bird.
[91:09.38]Let me see in the chat some journey up.
[91:16.41]Alright, thanks.
[91:17.39]Category 5 bird?
[91:18.95]What the fuck does that mean?
[91:21.81]Ready, kid?
[91:22.65]Here comes another oath.
[91:24.95]Don't pop a lid.
[91:25.87]Here's a loaf.
[91:28.03]Flip to the end and see that I dab.
[91:31.13]Witness the sick memes that I can grab.
[91:34.69]Oh, man.
[91:36.47]Alright, alright.
[91:38.50]We heard that.
[91:39.76]Uh, you... Kroski played to the audience, though.
[91:44.54]He's talking about dabbing, and I don't know.
[91:47.86]That's tough.
[91:48.46]You gotta get them votes in.
[91:57.39]The vote's in.
[92:02.41]They both win.
[92:05.33]A category 5 berth.
[92:16.34]Gross, he takes it. $25,000!
[92:28.18]I need my next two couple of MCs to step up.
[92:31.00]Alright.
[92:31.26]So this is the last one, right?
[92:35.26]Alright.
[92:36.14]See you, Kaiju.
[92:39.04]This stream's got me feeling hazy.
[92:42.85]Banging on your door like a fat bitch.
[92:46.67]Let's settle this with a race around the block.
[92:50.46]God, you had it!
[92:51.72]You had it.
[92:52.44]It was right there.
[92:53.78]It was a meatball down the middle of the plate.
[93:01.97]That's your music?
[93:03.13]I thought it was a Yerma.
[93:05.77]Spouting gibberish like a shitty streamer.
[93:09.50]Your rhymes are a mess.
[93:10.48]Go get a mop.
[93:13.36]You can't beat me.
[93:14.50]My rhymes just bopped.
[93:17.82]The last line.
[93:18.72]Yerma.
[93:20.26]It's always Yerma.
[93:21.70]You're just a shitty streamer.
[93:49.49]Let's settle this for the race around the block.
[93:52.73]I don't want to rap battle anymore.
[93:54.75]Let's see who can run faster.
[93:56.05]$25,000.
[93:56.07]We got another round?
[94:00.95]One more?
[94:01.25]Let's see who's winning this right now.
[94:21.54]Alright, I got a little bit of room here.
[94:23.06]I think I'm up to the finals.
[94:25.48]Okay, here we go.
[94:26.10]Let's see, let's see how to get this going.
[94:48.26]I'm sure I spell it right.
[94:49.56]I could spell it wrong.
[94:51.76]I could spell it wrong.
[95:03.23]God damn it.
[95:03.85]Now I'm gonna lose.
[95:34.83]Okay Okay, something good
[96:25.53]I gotta get this.
[96:26.11]Um, um, um, um, um, I don't know.
[96:51.20]I don't know!
[96:51.90]Quick, take the headphones off.
[96:59.30]Now if you can't think of anything at all, you can use that write for me button.
[97:13.53]Oh, okay.
[97:20.95]Got it.
[97:23.35]That was at the buzzer.
[97:24.23]I got it just barely.
[97:24.93]Alright, I'm ready.
[97:37.94]This game ain't over until I see you die.
[97:41.08]Let's go home and have a little fun.
[97:44.12]You try to match wits but can only match hacks.
[97:47.32]Hiding at home while I'm out catching rats.
[97:50.79]Alright.
[97:51.61]Hot fire, hot fire coming from them.
[97:56.99]Hot fire.
[97:59.22]Last round.
[97:59.80]Come on.
[98:00.08]Let's see it.
[98:01.24]You done over there?
[98:02.64]Or you gonna keep beating?
[98:04.34]This game is hard.
[98:05.20]I feel like cheating.
[98:06.19]It's hard not to choke when your rhymes are trash.
[98:10.49]This game sucks.
[98:11.39]Gotta go clear my cache.
[98:14.99]Oh, man.
[98:17.83]Okay, now it's over.
[98:21.77]Who's the dopest rapper?
[98:23.19]Who's the wackest cat?
[98:26.24]That was good.
[98:26.84]He got it.
[98:27.40]That was, I mean...
[98:30.22]Foxguy, that was a good attempt.
[98:31.70]It was.
[98:34.52]That was a good one.
[99:02.82]What the fuck is Chap doing?
[99:08.51]What the hell is going on over here?
[99:09.95]Alright Kenny, let's see.
[99:12.99]Good start.
[99:13.91]Hmm.
[99:14.13]That was...
[99:30.73]That had some structure to it.
[99:32.11]Did you hear what they just said?
[99:33.31]You gonna let them get away with that?
[99:36.93]That had structure to it.
[99:38.97]What's wrong with you?
[99:40.25]Were you raised by donkos?
[99:42.45]I see you round park sniffing ass, though.
[99:45.94]Listen to you?
[99:46.92]I'd rather listen to Kane.
[99:49.40]And I would even pay.
[99:56.82]Kane.
[99:57.04]18 seconds to decide who is the rap god of this round.
[100:33.27]Let's see.
[100:33.83]Who won?
[100:42.72]What the fuck is happening?
[100:44.16]Alright.
[100:44.62]Put it in sub only.
[100:46.06]It has to happen.
[100:48.35]Unfortunately.
[100:50.37]Unfortunately, that has to happen.
[100:52.53]Listen.
[101:06.38]Whatever it didn't say it right Didn't say it right Your mom is so dumb she says rap rhymes with taco No wonder you're such a wacko
[101:23.87]Trying to keep up?
[101:25.21]Let me get you in front.
[101:27.33]Watch out for that dunk.
[101:30.90]Oh, I almost just skipped it.
[101:31.86]Thank God I didn't.
[101:33.14]Time to pick somebody to vote for.
[101:36.64]Let's get those votes in.
[101:38.46]I had some misspellings in.
[101:40.16]They didn't phonetically pronounce the correct way.
[101:48.73]Time to vote.
[102:01.45]Come on.
[102:02.67]I think I did a decent job.
[102:15.38]Oh well.
[102:17.78]Oh well.
[102:18.40]I tried.
[102:18.82]I did try.
[102:19.94]Oh, beat her.
[102:20.52]Beat her.
[102:30.66]Alright, here's the last one.
[102:31.98]Listen now, and shut your ass.
[102:33.64]I'm gonna pop your son, be the top A class.
[102:38.18]Your game is ancient, like Mario.
[102:41.20]I'm gonna pop ya, and say in quote, sorry bro, in quote.
[102:47.95]Say in quotes.
[102:49.87]Now what you gonna say after that?
[102:51.19]In quotes.
[102:53.85]Is this how you play?
[102:55.23]Acting like a bum?
[102:56.89]I've got more talent just in my thumb.
[102:59.43]That was a buff pretty good.
[103:01.49]Those are both really good.
[103:04.23]Those are both good.
[103:07.65]Swear penalty?
[103:08.79]That's hard, but I think I made the right choice here.
[103:34.69]This is the final vote, right?
[103:39.91]Raph with a swear, you get a penalty, yeah.
[103:45.66]End quote.
[103:48.36]I knew it was gonna be close.
[103:58.37]Who won?
[104:05.11]Who's the winner?
[104:05.96]Who's the victor?
[104:08.90]Scooged.
[104:10.44]Almost a million dollars.
[104:12.14]Congratulations.
[104:13.22]Grats to you.
[104:14.20]Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
[104:23.23]Well... That was really fun.
[104:29.77]That's the best one so far.
[104:37.94]Alright, what else we got?
[104:38.78]We got two more?
[104:42.02]Patently Stupid and then Zeeple Dome.
[104:49.09]This one doesn't have an audience.
[104:50.59]I heard this one sucks.
[104:55.23]This is just like a party game you play with five, six people, right?
[105:01.62]They don't work.
[105:02.12]Okay.
[105:03.50]Okay.
[105:09.20]play it anyway?
[105:11.92]I mean, I kind of want to just see what it is.
[105:13.82]I mean, I can just kill the server in a second.
[105:25.58]No, no, it sucks that bad?
[105:28.95]One guy said that.
[105:38.80]Delius, fling yourself and win.
[105:40.68]You fling yourself around.
[105:42.05]Yeah, this isn't, like, questions.
[105:46.87]You just kind of jump around a screen.
[105:50.43]This does sound like Splatoon.
[105:56.39]And... Oh, well, I think the game crashed.
[106:01.21]How does Jackbox crash?
[106:02.68]That seems like something that's impossible to crash.
[106:12.13]Alright, well, what about the other one?
[106:13.71]Patently stupid.
[106:15.41]Do you need people to be talking?
[106:19.23]Maybe I'll save that one.
[106:24.82]So that's when you play with like a room full of people.
[106:29.52]Okay.
[106:33.04]Well.
[106:36.48]It's kinda air without people who are talking.
[106:43.16]Alright, well, um... I want to do this one again.
[106:47.26]This one was fun.
[106:49.82]We'll do these two again.
[106:50.94]This one was kind of eh.
[106:52.44]Split the Room was fun.
[106:56.38]This one was really fun.
[107:00.51]This one is just a party game.
[107:03.91]And then this one you need people to talk.
[107:05.55]Alright, let's do Split the Room.
[107:15.31]Go to the other jackbox.
[107:16.53]I could play the fourth one, too.
[107:19.79]I just wanted to check this one out first, you know?
[107:25.13]Okay.
[107:25.97]Required Twitch.
[107:29.20]Room censoring.
[107:30.16]That's right.
[107:32.84]Extended time isn't wrong.
[107:33.80]Okay.
[107:45.98]And, yeah, Monster Seeking Monster is really fun.
[107:47.80]We'll play that one.
[107:48.32]Alright, let me, uh, make sure I don't show this and make sure I get in.
[108:03.17]I'm in.
[108:08.29]Okay, guys.
[108:09.15]Remember, if you've already played, leave room for those that have not.
[108:15.40]I think we got all new people.
[108:20.27]Join us.
[108:20.63]I'm in.
[108:33.36]I misspelled it.
[108:34.72]Everybody's in.
[108:35.24]Let's go.
[108:36.86]Split the room.
[108:39.58]This one was fun.
[108:40.76]Oh, we already know how to do this.
[108:42.44]We already know how to do this.
[108:44.00]This is our second time.
[108:45.08]99 seconds.
[109:09.65]Alright.
[109:10.49]I got a scenario here, time to complete it.
[109:14.13]Okay.
[109:19.37]What?
[109:37.37]Alright, that's pretty good.
[109:38.47]I like this one.
[109:46.34]We already know what Chad is gonna choose.
[109:49.62]What do you guys have for Chad?
[109:53.64]Oh wait, actually, I don't wanna know that.
[109:55.64]It's supposed to be a secret, I'm not supposed to know.
[110:02.09]Oh yes, we know.
[110:13.79]It's a secret.
[110:15.23]Don't tell him.
[110:16.11]Alright, well, we'll find out.
[110:17.95]We'll see what you pranksters are doing.
[110:30.46]What's going on?
[110:32.72]He just got really angry.
[110:33.56]What was that?
[110:33.92]Hurry up.
[110:37.56]Time's running out.
[110:45.20]Three, two, wow, right at the buzzer.
[110:47.08]Somebody did it.
[110:47.80]Why sub only?
[110:48.25]Because people were just spamming.
[110:50.07]I don't know what the hell was going on.
[110:54.01]Okay.
[111:07.32]Oh my god, you awaken a genie.
[111:10.18]You and your best friend each get one wish.
[111:11.78]It's a prank.
[111:12.32]Your pal wishes your right foot was placed with a webcam facing up.
[111:16.18]Do you use your one wish to change it back?
[111:22.53]I mean, is the webcam connected to anything?
[111:27.87]Where is it?
[111:28.47]Is it broadcasting?
[111:29.57]Is it recording?
[111:30.37]Is it even plugged in?
[111:31.99]This is a very, very important question.
[111:37.14]Can I, like, cover it?
[111:38.34]Can I put, like, a sock over it?
[111:39.58]Can I put tape on it?
[111:49.53]What a shitty friend.
[111:50.41]Yeah, I know, really.
[111:51.05]I'm overcomplicating it.
[111:59.32]Well, you did a good job.
[112:02.54]You split the room.
[112:08.70]The longer it takes the room to answer, the more bonus points you get.
[112:12.64]Oh, damn.
[112:17.06]Up next is... Why wouldn't you vote no?
[112:20.06]Well, because, I don't know, you could find a way to figure it out.
[112:23.83]Baby on the way.
[112:24.73]Free childcare.
[112:25.15]And they're gonna name it this.
[112:26.39]Do you agree to the terms?
[112:36.28]Absolutely fucking 100%.
[112:37.64]No, who cares?
[112:38.70]Free child care for seven years?
[112:40.16]And I have to make boneless pizza?
[112:54.74]Free child care.
[112:59.56]The kid would be a legend.
[113:00.62]No.
[113:16.67]You can just rename him after.
[113:18.19]That'll save $450,000.
[113:18.93]Seven years... Yeah, the name is a lifetime.
[113:25.44]That name... See?
[113:30.40]Yes.
[113:31.22]Really?
[113:37.70]Room code is right here.
[113:39.32]O-Z-U-N.
[113:40.18]Know your angles.
[113:44.80]You have figured out the key to a perfect photogenic smile.
[113:47.68]But it means that instead of saying cheese, you have to say this.
[113:51.74]You are taking a photo with Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.
[113:55.90]Do you use your trick?
[113:58.16]I was literally about to hit censor as fast as I could.
[114:02.14]I had no idea what that could have been.
[114:07.23]Instead of cheese... The whole thing is to split the room, though.
[114:11.71]I mean, what...
[114:23.63]Tinky cheese!
[114:25.87]Cheese!
[114:45.12]It's cute.
[114:45.70]I don't think any...
[114:51.30]You would not say stinky cheese.
[114:56.44]Seven to one split.
[114:59.04]And a time bonus.
[115:01.80]Brace yourself for real friends.
[115:05.92]Real friends.
[115:07.10]Your imaginary friend since childhood suddenly materializes as this thing.
[115:11.99]It follows you everywhere.
[115:13.51]The only way to get rid of it is to kill it.
[115:15.57]You're on your way to work.
[115:16.87]Do you get rid of it?
[115:19.97]Huh?
[115:20.57]What do you do?
[115:21.95]You have to kill it to get rid of it.
[115:24.47]You're on your way to work.
[115:27.43]You're gonna kill it.
[115:28.09]You gonna get rid of it?
[115:28.63]Use him to get to work.
[115:59.70]Absolutely not.
[116:05.80]Sell it.
[116:08.48]Zero, here we go.
[116:10.98]Split it!
[116:12.52]Split the rope!
[116:13.62]Come on!
[116:19.71]Just sits behind you, drives around next to you.
[116:22.15]This scenario is called the saint versus the scoundrel.
[116:28.33]You run a charity that feeds and clothes the poor, but an evil billionaire decides that every time you raise $10 to help the unfortunate, he will do this.
[116:36.44]Do you still help the poor?
[116:41.12]Oh my god, but that, it's like, you're gonna die.
[116:46.73]You're gonna die.
[116:47.51]Your testicles are gonna explode.
[117:02.06]What are you supposed to do?
[117:02.92]Do you get to wear a cup?
[117:06.90]Can I wear like four pairs of jeans?
[117:12.32]Does it have to be?
[117:13.28]Do I have to have it just kind of hanging out?
[117:24.74]He's naked.
[117:28.68]That's causing damage.
[117:29.49]That's real damage.
[117:30.03]Yes.
[117:30.17]Feast your eyes on...
[117:47.54]Sauce that is awesome.
[117:49.08]Sauce that is awesome.
[117:51.00]You have the power to remove the word awesome sauce from the English lexicon.
[117:54.98]It will never be heard again.
[117:56.70]However, it will be replaced with this new popular expression.
[118:00.48]Is it worth it?
[118:04.06]Who cares?
[118:05.72]Awesome sauce?
[118:12.12]Just so somebody says, awesome sauce!
[118:15.02]What's wrong with that?
[118:16.88]Like, if you were at, for instance, like, you were just at the casino, maybe, like, two weeks ago, and you pulled a lever and you won 40 bucks on, like, a $1 spin, and you say, awesome sauce, and you high-five your friend, was that something wrong with doing that?
[118:33.78]Something wrong with doing that, apparently.
[118:36.66]Why is that such a bad thing?
[118:45.00]I mean, it's one of my favorite words.
[118:48.92]Oh, I hope it doesn't get replaced.
[118:50.02]I say it, like, every five minutes.
[118:54.52]And I just, like, stupidly split the room.
[119:01.30]I don't say awesome sauce, don't worry.
[119:03.36]Okay.
[119:04.64]Okay.
[119:11.55]You have been banned from New York City.
[119:13.47]Banned from New York City.
[119:15.07]In order to set foot in there again, you must do this.
[119:18.72]Do you do it?
[119:19.38]Yeah, you've been banned from New York.
[119:24.54]In order to set foot there, you must... I live in... Alright, what do I have to do?
[119:38.40]Do I just have to go stand in front of it?
[119:41.97]You're banned from New York City.
[119:43.92]And for some reason, you have to just go stand there.
[119:48.12]What's the catch?
[119:48.84]Is there a catch?
[119:57.22]How do you get there?
[119:58.97]Visit.
[119:59.47]Go in.
[119:59.91]Can you just walk in and turn around?
[120:09.89]I just have to walk in.
[120:17.25]Visiting doesn't mean anything.
[120:19.45]If you're banned from New York City, like you are banned from ever going to New York City, you just have to go to, you just walk in and then walk out?
[120:30.46]Uh...
[120:51.87]You say a hundred wonderful things, but when it comes to your new husband, you totally blank the only thing you can remember is that he tapped.
[121:00.35]The only thing you can remember.
[121:09.78]Censor it quick.
[121:28.07]What do we got?
[121:32.70]Yeah, whatever.
[121:33.22]It don't matter.
[121:37.08]So what if he dabbed on stream?
[121:38.48]I'm sure he's a wonderful, wonderful person.
[121:40.85]Caring.
[121:43.07]Fun to be around.
[121:45.51]Very intelligent.
[121:46.33]Very handsome.
[121:47.05]Like, it's okay.
[121:50.17]One of your good childhood friends recently moved to the city you reside in.
[121:53.74]He means well, but when he's in big groups, he starts over-explaining this subject.
[121:58.80]Even when no one asks, do you invite him to your birthday party?
[122:04.64]Well, here's the problem.
[122:06.42]I do this.
[122:07.86]Like, you know, I've got colitis, and my colon's all fucked up, diarrhea.
[122:12.23]I am this friend.
[122:12.87]You didn't even have to make the joke.
[122:15.09]So, I mean, yes, why not?
[122:17.07]Invite him to the birthday party, of course, because I've been invited to birthday parties and done this before.
[122:25.17]I've been at parties and get-togethers where I'm avoiding the cheese dip.
[122:29.47]Oh, you gotta try the cheese dip!
[122:31.44]No, see, I can't.
[122:32.86]You know, I've got that blood and the colitis.
[122:35.38]I have diarrhea and it's a thing.
[122:37.58]But back in like 2009, I was diagnosed with it.
[122:40.28]And yeah, I've done that before.
[122:41.34]Invite me to your fucking party.
[122:55.49]what what why would you oh it's you're actually actually writing colons here's where everybody stacks up at the moment
[123:21.29]What the fuck is that?
[123:24.75]What is that?
[123:26.68]There will be two options to choose from.
[123:28.84]Door number one is already provided.
[123:30.98]You will decide what's behind door number three.
[123:32.96]I can't.
[123:33.14]I'm sorry.
[123:33.34]I looked over at the Discord.
[123:34.74]What the fuck is that?
[123:37.68]What is that?
[123:39.70]You'll earn some bonus points.
[123:41.61]Let's begin.
[123:43.51]Alright.
[123:44.05]Okay.
[123:44.85]Let's pick the door.
[123:46.13]Write an option that you think only some people would choose.
[123:51.57]Okay, let me think about this for a second.
[123:59.98]Okay.
[124:16.22]This one's like, I don't know.
[124:24.69]That's tough.
[124:25.53]That's kind of tough.
[124:26.73]That's a tough one.
[124:41.58]I guess it's time to lose the image rights in the sub Discord again.
[124:47.83]Silence!
[124:48.81]Silence in the Discord!
[125:02.59]Shut up, Dad!
[125:10.85]Alright, we're almost done here?
[125:14.35]We ready?
[125:18.29]These are cat memes, you're right.
[125:22.69]This is a real cat meme.
[125:24.59]You got it.
[125:25.84]Here it is.
[125:32.30]You have booked a week on a specialized party cruise, but you screwed up the dates.
[125:36.02]You screwed up the dates.
[125:36.74]As you walk the dock, the only two gangways available are for senior singles or this.
[125:43.02]Senior singles.
[125:47.36]Um, that sounds kind of interesting.
[125:52.18]Uh...
[125:54.69]I don't... I don't understand.
[126:08.45]I mean, it... I... This is just, like, seniors.
[126:11.31]You could probably get some interesting stories here.
[126:14.52]I'm gonna pick this every time.
[126:18.24]This is... this is not bad.
[126:19.16]This is interesting.
[126:19.90]You know how many stories you're gonna hear here?
[126:24.18]Okay.
[126:26.31]Oh, that's tough, though.
[126:29.25]That makes it even harder.
[126:30.93]These are both very interesting.
[126:39.54]Seniors or amateur jugglers?
[126:44.93]Yeah, you might get hurt there, though.
[126:58.56]Which themed... Or like Macaulay Culkin, kind of like Child Star.
[127:10.47]I don't get it.
[127:24.58]Or grandma or who?
[127:26.40]The grandma or the kitchen chef.
[127:46.84]I mean, one of those is embarrassing, and the other one, like, well, I mean, in defense, is your grandma cool with this?
[127:52.30]Might be one of those grandmas that's just like, whatever.
[127:54.30]Do what makes you happy.
[127:55.84]Okay.
[127:56.66]I don't know.
[128:07.24]No bonus points for you.
[128:16.50]Who do you pick as your emergency contact?
[128:18.22]Your grandmother or your ex?
[128:27.67]Hmm?
[128:29.45]I wonder.
[128:37.82]Oh, I thought that was gonna be much harder!
[128:39.72]Wow!
[128:43.92]I'm surprised.
[128:44.68]I really thought that you guys would rather get grandma called your grandma or your priest.
[128:55.27]I'll just never go to church again.
[129:04.23]Hey, call the priest.
[129:05.67]That's alright.
[129:06.25]I'll just change churches.
[129:19.56]Now for something different You've died and become a ghost you can either haunt the Newark airport or this spot which location do you haunt?
[129:29.40]You need a haunt the airport Boring
[129:48.29]There's so much more to, like, see and listen to.
[129:52.94]People, like, traveling and seeing, going places.
[129:56.26]Applebee's is just people eating fucking riblets.
[130:00.56]Or, like, shitty sandwiches.
[130:02.28]Like, turkey BLT, you know what I mean?
[130:04.16]Like, that's not interesting.
[130:06.96]The- oh.
[130:17.54]I don't know, like... No.
[130:26.41]Nothing interesting happens at the Elbertson house, don't worry.
[130:34.28]That was a pretty good meme answer, though.
[130:35.82]Good meme answer.
[130:47.03]Why would you do that to me?
[130:49.73]Why would you do that to me?
[130:51.65]The airport is so much more interesting.
[130:58.37]Hey, joke's on you.
[130:59.55]My router already is haunted.
[131:01.31]You're gonna have to fight another fucking ghost to get in there.
[131:05.41]And it's a strong spirit, too.
[131:07.45]Good luck.
[131:12.15]It all comes down to this.

[138:25.29]I love all my MCs, but y'all gotta back up.
[138:28.27]I'm not about to be a statistic down here.
[138:31.73]Okay, it's your turn, Rach.
[138:33.67]I gotta figure out what's going on with all these robots.
[138:37.13]Wait, is that the guy that makes Jerma videos?
[138:40.09]That is Holy Mac.
[138:41.51]Second Jerma.
[138:42.16]We'll ask you for a word or a phrase.
[138:44.26]We'll use it to complete line one of your rap.
[138:47.00]You then write a line that rhymes with it.
[138:49.82]We do that about two times and you have your four line verse.
[138:54.52]We hear him back and we vote on that winner.
[138:56.66]Vote for Mac.
[138:57.32]Honestly, you all are.
[139:00.79]Are we going to get a Holy Mack versus Jerma scenario?
[139:03.73]It's possible.
[139:04.35]Alright.
[139:05.19]We got three minutes.
[139:06.49]Let's see what we can get.
[139:28.56]Oh, my opponent is Holy Mac!
[139:30.82]Here it comes!
[139:31.80]Alright, it's gonna be good.
[139:33.54]It happened.
[139:34.14]It's happening.
[139:35.12]It's happening.
[139:35.68]Okay.
[140:04.37]Ooh.
[140:13.88]Okay.
[140:25.73]Damn it.
[140:26.87]I might get locked up here.
[140:30.63]I think I might get locked up on this one.
[140:41.40]Shit.
[140:45.68]Shit!
[140:49.30]No, I got it.
[140:50.02]Just give me, just give me time.
[140:51.02]Give me some time here.
[141:03.04]Okay, do do do do do do do do do.
[141:15.53]Oh, this does not work with what I JUST WROTE!
[141:25.52]OH!
[141:27.04]It's just too- it's so- it's so nerve-wracking!
[141:53.42]Oh, hold on.
[141:54.94]Oh, I might be.
[141:55.60]I do.
[141:55.78]Got it.
[142:16.95]I think.
[142:17.19]Oh, here we go.
[142:17.75]Denver versus Mac.
[142:18.95]Let's see it.
[142:19.93]My words are magical.
[142:20.89]Call me Gandalf the Grey.
[142:22.07]One ring to rule this feat.
[142:22.87]Why you running away?
[142:23.69]I won a Nobel Prize for Washington.
[142:46.86]Mount Doom calling you.
[142:48.06]It's your final resting.
[142:50.30]Fuck.
[142:50.90]It's washing.
[142:51.99]It's good.
[142:52.59]I see we got a pro around us yet, superstar rapper.
[142:56.63]Ooh, you've got to respond to that.
[143:01.51]I deliver it hot as spaghetti.
[143:04.95]You wanna fight me?
[143:06.31]You're gonna regret it.
[143:08.45]My words are presents I deliver like Harry Potter.
[143:11.83]You can't step to the mat.
[143:13.33]You're a fish out of water.
[143:15.25]Well, we both had references.
[143:17.11]We both had pretty good references.
[143:18.54]Let's keep it moving.
[143:20.78]Yo, check it out.
[143:21.78]Now it's time to use your devices to vote on who brought it stronger.
[143:31.86]They were both fucking unbelievable.
[143:38.10]Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.
[143:40.03]It's pretty much what your favorite series is.
[143:43.03]What we're going to find out right now is Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings more popular.
[143:47.66]That's it.
[144:06.71]Okay.
[144:07.11]Here's your winner.
[144:08.05]Congrats.
[144:10.10]Where my two MCs at?
[144:11.44]Let's go.
[144:15.66]What?
[144:16.06]That... That... I got... My raps are so furious they cause the rain.
[144:22.07]I'm sorry.
[144:22.57]I didn't mean to join again.
[144:24.99]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[144:26.47]Hold on, were you here before?
[144:29.03]Hold on, you were here before.
[144:31.35]You were here before.
[144:32.59]Oh shit, he was in the first game.
[144:47.69]That was just a full, full of references.
[144:50.03]Each line, one by one.
[144:51.13]Each one of those lines.
[145:20.28]You gotta get them votes in.
[145:26.85]Vote for honesty.
[145:32.33]Banned me.
[145:36.53]I can't.
[145:40.75]We're in the middle of the game.
[145:47.96]Oh, wow.
[145:48.40]You know what you're doing, you know how you're doing, and it's done.
[145:53.84]You won.
[145:55.50]He was honest at least.
[145:56.34]The next two battlers are up and they're ready to roll.
[145:58.42]Alright, Mint Ramney versus Mr. Dunwich.
[146:03.18]Kanye and Drake, they call me for a raid, so I dress up as a maid.
[146:09.18]I can do it all, like Jerma.
[146:12.18]Vote for me to win a free iPad.
[146:17.16]Your pass on that because this is your first time doing this but don't ever come back with that wackiness Yo, where the next body get your gears in gear?
[146:28.67]My features as bright as a burning medium thin crust with my opponent's face telling me they're food My lines are so sweet.
[146:35.73]They're covered in galaxies Milky way bitch your verses are all fallacies.
[146:40.72]Oh
[146:47.56]You put too many syllables, too many words in the first line.
[146:54.54]That was pretty good poetic structure.
[147:20.27]He just said, if I win, I'm gonna feel bad.
[147:25.64]Why?
[147:31.14]iPad contains a virus.
[147:33.92]Okay, good job, good job.
[147:35.44]We got your winner.
[147:36.77]Hey man, come on, watch where you're stepping.
[147:39.75]Alright, where my next two MCs at?
[147:41.35]Alright, here we go.
[147:43.47]We got Lucratius versus, uh, Thancora.
[147:46.03]That's so tough.
[147:46.97]They call me Stephen Hawking.
[147:49.29]Touch me and you will be the one not walking.
[147:52.50]Oh boy.
[147:53.12]My arms are fresh like a ripe new potato.
[147:55.48]Oh boy.
[147:56.00]That's, uh... Time for you to be like Chairman Pluto.
[148:00.50]Ooh.
[148:02.18]Ooh, that was it.
[148:04.32]Yo, you gotta get that.
[148:11.00]The game crashed.
[148:13.23]The game crashed.
[148:13.89]It gets disconnected.
[148:15.95]I didn't do it.
[148:16.53]Oh.
[148:30.91]The game fucking crashed.
[148:33.63]Oh, dear.
[148:36.83]What was your line?
[148:37.73]What was your rap, Luke?
[148:49.82]Why is Jackbox crashing?
[148:53.12]What is here to crash?
[148:56.42]Well, um... Luke is the new green screen.
[149:07.67]Too many graphics.
[149:11.49]Well, I think we're going to do... I think that was as any time as any to open up Party Pack 4.
[149:18.20]Do I have Party Pack 4?
[149:22.70]It crashed for me as well.
[149:25.50]That's annoying.
[149:28.32]Do I not have this?
[149:30.59]How did I play this before?
[149:41.01]No, I already own this.
[149:45.57]Was it on PS4?
[149:46.55]I might have owned it on PS4.
[149:51.87]Yeah, I think it's on PS4.
[149:52.69]Oh, maybe not.
[149:58.54]It might be on the wrong thing here.
[150:04.38]No, yeah, your account already owns this game, so why can I not install it?
[150:07.91]That's weird.
[150:12.19]No, it was telling me, oh, you can purchase it, but that's weird.
[150:15.91]Alright, let's get Party Pack 4 going here.
[150:23.48]That's so annoying.
[150:25.46]That one's definitely the best one.
[150:26.52]I think maybe we need some other people in, like, voice to do the other games.
[150:32.18]So I'm just going to put this up temporarily while I get this going.
[150:40.69]Give me one second.
[150:46.95]Here's Jackbox.
[150:50.20]Yeah, I have all of them.
[150:51.22]The only one I don't have is two.
[150:53.22]I don't have two.
[150:54.64]So for some reason I have every single one.
[150:57.24]But two.
[151:02.22]The other one is you give presentations.
[151:05.72]So it's way better when people are talking.
[151:07.16]Yeah, that's true.
[151:13.24]Is it the same site for Jackbox 4?
[151:14.70]It is the same site for all of them.
[151:16.00]So you are good to go.
[151:26.86]I'm opening it.
[151:27.58]I'm going to mute the audio here because it's probably going to be very loud.
[151:30.88]So, opening Party Pack 4!
[151:31.92]Probably should change the title to Party Pack 4.
[151:38.79]It is very loud, so... Alright.
[151:49.92]Yeah, we got Fibbage 3, save the internet.
[151:53.78]Full screen mode is on.
[151:55.36]I need to just change this to make sure it's getting the right screen, of course.
[152:01.59]And here we go.
[152:06.23]Party back four.
[152:09.49]We're sorry, we can't seem to... Oh, there we go.
[152:11.01]That was weird.
[152:13.78]So we can survive the internet.
[152:15.80]Monster seeking monster.
[152:19.46]Survive the internet.
[152:24.25]5H3.
[152:27.11]Well, let's do Monster Seeking Monster.
[152:28.63]I remember this being a lot of fun.
[152:34.03]This one was a ton of fun.
[152:42.12]Let's turn the audio back on.
[152:47.61]Okay.
[152:48.43]Audience.
[152:49.23]Extended timers.
[152:50.38]Yes.
[152:51.06]Require Twitch.
[152:52.52]Room code hiding.
[152:53.52]Alright, here we go.
[152:59.36]Let me make sure it's hidden.
[153:06.48]Alright.
[153:06.86]Same deal.
[153:07.16]I'm going to put it into the... Let's try to get the... If Luke, if you and Mac want to play again.
[153:16.14]You did get kind of cut off there.
[153:21.47]You did get cut off if any of the mods would like to play this one.
[153:24.67]And then I'll put it into the sub Discord.
[153:31.76]Alright, Luke is in.
[153:38.40]And if Mac wants to play as well, if you don't...
[153:52.82]Anybody?
[153:54.32]Anybody?
[153:55.88]Just Luke?
[153:58.98]Think it's just Luke?
[154:02.41]Alright, looks like it's just Luke for this one.
[154:08.61]So here we go, sub Discord.
[154:11.57]Please only join if you have not played before.
[154:22.26]Oh, I have to join too.
[154:23.44]That's very important.
[154:25.49]Come on in!
[154:30.87]Uh... Hold on a second here.
[154:34.39]We've got somebody here that's not supposed to be in here!
[154:45.04]Uh, Scooge is in.
[154:46.56]Scooge?
[154:51.76]Sorry, Scouge, we need to open up that spot!
[154:59.00]Gotta open up that spot!
[155:09.82]How do I... can I, like, just... Luke is... oh, Luke's VIP.
[155:16.62]Is there a way, Luke, that you can open up that spot?
[155:24.94]I'm not sure we can even do it.
[155:27.04]You should be able to.
[155:28.74]Can you?
[155:31.00]You can't.
[155:33.83]Oh.
[155:33.99]Oh, he says he left.
[155:42.41]Uh, huh.
[155:45.39]Alright, hold on.
[155:46.07]We'll try it again.
[155:49.27]That was so loud for some reason.
[155:54.82]Alright, we're going for it again.
[156:00.02]Here you go, Luke.
[156:02.74]I think it messed up when he left the game.
[156:09.31]Alright, here we go.
[156:17.59]No, I know you can't see.
[156:18.39]You're not supposed to see.
[156:23.34]Alright, I'm joining myself.
[156:24.84]Alright, we got Moo this time.
[156:30.51]Moo means Moo and Lucretius.
[156:33.71]And now, let's try it again.
[156:40.37]Hey, there we go.
[156:41.33]Look at that.
[156:42.13]Bingo.
[156:48.69]Come on in.
[156:52.65]Look at Moo.
[157:00.67]Sorry, everybody that joined.
[157:05.03]It's tough.
[157:05.81]It's tough to moderate it.
[157:07.27]Be nice.
[157:24.21]The room codes are too complicated.
[157:25.63]Y, C, W, Q.
[157:30.01]Alright, everybody in?
[157:32.13]So this is when we have to date each other.
[157:33.27]You text to each other, you try to go on a date.
[157:48.32]You can add more player slots.
[157:49.84]I thought it was eight.
[157:53.06]Isn't eight the max on every one of these games?
[158:02.49]Oh, right, Luke has to press it.
[158:04.39]Oh, because I forgot I'm not VIP.
[158:05.50]Alright, Luke, Flash, everybody's in!
[158:15.09]Audience is player 8.
[158:17.05]Oh, yeah.
[158:20.05]More slots would be... That would be impossible to do.
[158:24.88]It would take so long.
[158:26.42]Oh, okay.
[158:26.94]Six nights.
[158:28.78]Mm-hmm.
[158:49.15]Did I mention you're all secrets and monsters?
[158:51.05]It's fun that chat can play.
[158:51.75]Check your devices now to see your secret powers and how you can earn bonus hearts if you put them to good use.
[158:57.46]Oh, and you can date the audience, which is collectively controlling this player by voting on everything they do.
[159:02.94]Oh, I wish I could play.
[159:05.74]Join the audience if you want to play.
[159:13.46]Date me.
[159:13.96]Alright, knight number one.
[159:17.55]Let's start by chatting with other players and trying to set up dates.
[159:21.35]You can only send four messages each night, so use them once- Dude, you're only allowed to do four texts.
[159:30.50]Alright, so... Who do I want to chat with?
[159:47.21]Oh, the audience's first message is automatically sent to everyone each night.
[159:51.58]And it shows up here on the screen too.
[159:53.80]Isn't that fun?
[159:54.48]This is where you secretly have to type.
[160:12.30]I probably should have mentioned that some of your conversations will appear on screen during the dates.
[160:17.35]Oh well, I'm sure it won't be incriminating.
[160:46.13]20 seconds left to send your messages.
[160:51.64]Don't dilly-dally.
[161:15.13]Now, on your device, pick the one person you hope you're going on a date with tonight.
[161:21.61]I'm keeping my mandibles crossed for everyone to do well.
[161:24.71]Alright, let's see it.
[161:26.15]OK, let's see who everyone tried to date.
[161:37.18]And if you don't get a date, don't worry.
[161:38.74]This is just the first night.
[161:43.33]Night Queen asked out the audience.
[161:45.89]Hey chat, how's it going?
[161:47.13]Not sure if I like moo means moo.
[161:48.95]jermaVenus, if you see this, don't trust moo means moo.
[161:51.55]Have fun, you lovelies.
[161:52.88]Have more fun, all you need is murder.
[161:57.02]Rejected.
[161:57.62]Oh, Luke asked out chat.
[162:06.08]I know we've had our ups and downs, but you know I love you, even if I took away your images.
[162:10.02]Don't trust Moomijmoo!
[162:11.76]Agreed.
[162:12.18]It really smells like swamps around here.
[162:14.84]You rejected him!
[162:18.58]Moomijmoo wants to date!
[162:20.23]Oh?
[162:21.09]Anything?
[162:22.03]Nah.
[162:24.31]Well, why did you say yes?!
[162:27.73]Why did you say yes?!
[162:28.95]Oh no!
[162:36.92]A spiff-assed out card?
[162:39.38]Hey babes, you?
[162:40.10]You.
[162:41.20]Yo.
[162:42.20]Oh, give me a break.
[162:45.30]Just delete the game.
[163:03.76]So you are doing the best and you are doing less so.
[163:07.80]A quick word of warning.
[163:09.42]Whoever is in the top spot at the end of the second night of dates will have their monster power.
[163:13.84]They will have their monster powers shown to everybody.
[163:16.80]Same for the highest ranking unrevealed monster.
[163:19.30]Alright, night number two.
[163:25.42]The secret word is movie.
[163:27.66]In case that affects your monster power.
[163:30.13]What does that mean?
[163:30.67]Secret word.
[163:35.84]Alright, I'm gonna... Let's make it happen.
[163:37.12]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[164:03.72]Maybe, come on.
[164:44.56]Oh, this chatting in secret is so much fun.
[164:48.53]He blocked.
[164:59.41]Nothing relaxes me like taxes.
[165:01.60]How is that something you could even pick?
[165:05.67]How is that even possible?
[165:06.95]Alright, let's see.
[165:07.57]It's time for dates.
[165:08.75]Spartan cat is interested in spiff.
[165:11.29]The face again, the face again.
[165:36.40]No, it didn't work this time.
[165:39.17]Even she said it.
[165:41.43]It might help to use OOF if... Oh, it asked me out.
[165:45.71]You know, I'm the best mod, so I'm the best date.
[165:48.29]Hmm.
[165:49.79]I accept this proposal.
[165:51.17]I also want a raise.
[165:53.09]That's where you get rejected.
[165:55.36]You had me until... Come on, man.
[166:00.30]Only if you ban the dab emote.
[166:01.80]Get out of here.
[166:08.72]Did you take a shower?
[166:10.18]Thinking about dressing as trash.
[166:15.52]What?!
[166:27.13]Oh, I hate this.
[166:34.26]Moo asked out Lucratius.
[166:36.38]Uh-oh.
[166:45.68]Raar at Nuzzles, how are you?
[166:47.79]Oh, hides under the- ain't by anything lately.
[166:49.57]Oh, my fucking god.
[166:56.17]I can't believe I was rejected.
[166:57.65]I was gonna give you a chance.
[166:58.83]You may not trust you.
[166:59.53]You lost your chance.
[167:00.15]Serial killer.
[167:19.66]The serial killer steals two hearts from a player the second time they date each other.
[167:24.30]Okay, so you don't want to date the serial killer twice.
[167:25.88]You can do that again whenever you want on your device by hitting the info button on their chat screen.
[167:30.07]The same goes for any monster after they're revealed.
[167:38.23]Night number three.
[167:39.56]Almost to the halfway point.
[167:41.14]Uh-oh, full moon tonight.
[167:42.30]Okay.
[167:46.70]Message time.
[167:50.40]Message time.
[168:08.17]I'm gonna get some hands on some fingers.
[168:10.93]What the fuck?
[168:49.08]What are you talking about?
[168:50.70]Hey, what about me?
[168:56.45]20 seconds and counting.
[169:18.64]I don't have any messages left.
[169:39.17]I'm just like laughing over here.
[169:43.80]I'm not even saying anything.
[169:45.06]The creature who wants to date?
[169:46.58]Card.
[169:47.78]Oh, that's crazy.
[169:48.48]What do you do though?
[169:49.90]You know, ban and people.
[169:51.24]Oh, that's crazy.
[169:52.70]By the way, what's your Discord?
[169:54.06]What?
[169:57.68]I thought he said bang and... If you stack two lasagnas on top, how many lasagnas is it?
[170:05.07]I don't- what?
[170:07.13]Another one.
[170:09.44]It's chat!
[170:10.90]I need to get my hands on some fingers.
[170:12.18]I got two hands full of those.
[170:13.82]I think you could use more Jerma.
[170:15.22]That's me, so I mean, maybe.
[170:16.98]What are your thoughts on, uh... You're my favorite mod.
[170:28.45]Kisses.
[170:28.99]Blush.
[170:29.75]Uh-oh.
[170:35.29]But what about me?
[170:36.21]Oh, rejection.
[170:36.47]Spiff wants to date Moo.
[170:37.11]Already dating.
[170:37.69]We chose wrong.
[171:05.81]Come on, you guys... I picked you guys the first night, and then you rejected me, so I'm getting my rejection revenge.
[171:14.21]You rejected us first.
[171:19.47]You rejected me, and then I rejected you.
[171:22.30]I rejected you first, and then you rejected me, and then I rejected you back.
[171:42.42]Get to messaging.
[172:18.28]Hmm...
[172:54.18]20 second warning.
[173:04.50]I got confused about what I just said.
[173:10.85]I just got really confused by my own words.
[173:12.95]Okay, time's up.
[173:15.61]Alright, it's time to pick dates again.
[173:17.71]This part always makes me giggle.
[173:30.94]I don't even fucking know what I'm saying.
[173:38.77]Here we go.
[173:42.31]Spiff wants to date Spartan Cat.
[173:47.43]Who rejected who there?
[173:48.35]I don't understand.
[173:49.03]Oh, Moo means Moo wants to date the audience.
[173:53.00]You had me at apathy.
[173:54.48]I don't care.
[173:55.96]If bad jokes is wrong, I don't want to be right.
[173:57.68]Then Jerma's the wrongest man I know.
[174:00.00]Rejected.
[174:02.15]Uh... Hey guys.
[174:06.03]I know I've been cruel, but this time I think it's for real.
[174:08.97]You had me at apathy.
[174:09.65]See?
[174:09.75]It worked, huh?
[174:12.09]Must've dated me.
[174:14.41]Already dating.
[174:15.47]Sorry.
[174:15.65]Sorry.
[174:37.05]I'd love to get banned for my second favorite mod.
[174:39.27]Thanks.
[174:39.47]We'll visit you later.
[174:40.37]Wait, why can't I type in chat anymore?
[174:51.35]Let's see if any of that changed the social pecking order.
[174:55.08]Ooh, moving it around.
[174:57.02]Still in second to last place.
[174:58.06]What is chat?
[174:58.72]Chat is the ghost?
[175:05.78]The vengeful ghost starts the game with a bonus heart.
[175:08.44]When the vengeful ghost asks someone on a date and gets rejected, that person loses a heart.
[175:13.41]Be careful around the vengeful ghost.
[175:16.91]What?
[175:20.11]What the fuck?
[175:24.09]So that's what's been happening this whole time.
[175:28.80]That's why I'm in last place.
[175:30.56]Message time.
[176:03.31]Ha ha ha!
[176:41.96]We're down to 20 seconds.
[177:01.13]Oh, sorry.
[177:02.31]Time's up.
[177:03.68]Fuck, I read it in time.
[177:04.96]Time to pick your date.
[177:07.84]The suspense is killing me.
[177:09.82]Not literally.
[177:10.74]I'm immortal.
[177:20.48]Joke's on you.
[177:21.62]They never answer.
[177:22.84]If you don't pick anyone, you'll be severely penalized.
[177:38.32]Let's see those dates.
[177:42.89]I'm asking out the audience.
[177:50.29]Wait.
[177:51.73]Looks like someone had the same idea.
[177:54.17]Let's see.
[177:55.55]Same idea?
[177:56.21]Fucking assholes.
[178:13.06]Why are you doing?
[178:14.26]Well, who do you?
[178:17.76]Who the fuck is it then?
[178:18.58]You asked out Moo.
[178:19.68]Okay.
[178:28.99]Yeah, you guys got rejected.
[178:30.29]Get rejected.
[178:32.67]Oh, but... Moo means Moo asked out Lucratius.
[178:38.49]Oh, okay.
[178:39.08]That's not good.
[178:48.25]Are they gonna do, like, the fucking face again?
[178:50.16]Do you hate sand?
[178:52.16]It's very rough.
[178:52.80]It does get everywhere.
[178:54.52]It gets everywhere.
[178:55.34]Yeah.
[178:55.56]Uh-oh, I got two werewolves now.
[179:27.13]Let's see what's what now.
[179:29.46]Well, well, well.
[179:30.14]Stuff definitely happened there.
[179:31.80]Hey, not in the last place.
[179:33.34]Time for another reveal.
[179:34.40]You are a leprechaun.
[179:40.76]Everyone who dates an unrevealed leprechaun gets two fake hearts.
[179:46.45]That's not good.
[179:47.57]All fake hearts disappear.
[179:49.73]At this moment, leprechauns get one bonus heart for every player that drops in the rankings.
[179:59.56]So sorry, guys.
[180:00.94]One player dropped in the rankings.
[180:02.38]You could have just got screwed.
[180:11.59]Oh my god, no.
[180:12.01]The Blood Harvest Festival.
[180:13.57]You get two hearts for dating now because it's such a special night.
[180:21.33]Get to messaging.
[180:24.59]Okay, here we go.
[180:28.52]Hmm.
[181:00.03]Cheers.
[181:32.81]Just 20 more seconds.
[181:34.15]Okay, time's up.
[181:35.64]Alright, it's time for big dates again.
[182:00.35]Here we go!
[182:00.87]Final night!
[182:01.67]He lost a heart.
[182:03.02]Audience asked out, moo means moo.
[182:04.24]Oh, silence.
[182:25.13]When I close my eyes, I see youth culture.
[182:26.82]You guys get rejected every time.
[182:29.62]You guys get rejected every time.
[182:32.64]Ooh, I asked out Lucratius.
[182:38.01]You know what?
[182:38.53]Fuck chat.
[182:39.45]I just remembered to wear protection.
[182:47.47]Hey, she just wants to date Spartan Cat.
[182:50.31]I know it's a full moon tonight, but you're the only moon I would like to howl at.
[182:52.88]Chat is better by not having even- What?
[182:55.18]Someone's lining up, hoping to be next.
[182:57.52]Let's see what happens.
[182:59.80]Nooooooo!
[183:04.72]I'm gonna go!
[183:06.47]I may be willing to forgive.
[183:07.55]Let's put aside our past.
[183:08.45]What did you say?
[183:09.81]Really?
[183:11.37]One last O.W.O.
[183:11.85]for the road.
[183:18.00]Oh, no.
[183:18.36]That's not good.
[183:33.53]Yeah!
[183:33.83]Scammer.
[183:46.62]One last thing it's time for the after party time to reveal any remaining hidden monster powers.
[183:57.85]Okay.
[183:58.37]Let's see your secret I'm a Monster Hunter at the end of the game the Monster Hunter gets a bonus heart for every time they date the monster type They've secretly been told to hunt
[184:13.11]Hmm.
[184:14.31]Hmm.
[184:15.01]Vampire.
[184:16.81]And Alucard.
[184:18.47]Everyone the vampire dates becomes a vampire, and then so do the people they date.
[184:22.62]At the end, this vampire receives half a bonus heart for every vampire in the game.
[184:29.44]Glob.
[184:32.93]Every time the glob successfully dates three new players, its heart tally doubles.
[184:37.87]That's a lot to remember.
[184:39.55]Invisible person.
[184:43.36]The invisible person started the game with two bonus hearts.
[184:46.32]The invisible person's score is invisible, so they appear to be in last place until the end of the game.
[184:52.04]Not fair.
[184:52.56]Time to tally up any after-party bonus hearts.
[184:55.99]Let's see if anybody became a werewolf.
[184:59.53]Hmm, two werewolves were created.
[185:01.23]That doesn't affect the score.
[185:02.05]I just keep my eye on werewolves.
[185:05.29]Who was the Monster Hunter hunting this whole time?
[185:08.59]The vampire, who they never did successfully date.
[185:12.47]Sorry, Monster Hunter.
[185:15.11]Let's see how many of you were turned into vampires.
[185:20.83]Poor vampires.
[185:22.03]How does that affect the final game?
[185:31.39]SpartaCat, congratulations.
[185:32.55]You won.
[185:38.68]Five and a half hearts created two werewolves.
[185:41.47]And you dated.
[185:43.85]Dated.
[185:45.33]Couldn't get anyone to date a second time, unfortunately.
[185:47.83]Ore.
[185:53.05]Uh, tricked two players with a total of four fake hearts.
[185:55.76]Spiff.
[185:56.58]Nice work.
[185:57.48]Nice work!
[186:00.48]Uh, directly made one vampire, and they made three more vampires.
[186:08.61]Real rank each night.
[186:09.79]Second, second, second, second, third, fifth.
[186:12.45]My god.
[186:15.63]Tracked vampire all game.
[186:17.21]Never did manage to date them.
[186:21.84]Couldn't do it.
[186:23.22]Inflicted five.
[186:24.00]Lost hearts of damage on players who scorned them.
[186:28.04]Yes, you did.
[186:30.54]Minus 1.5.
[186:32.72]Dated two players.
[186:33.76]Never quite doubled.
[186:35.75]Hahaha.
[186:39.45]Alright.
[186:40.77]Cool.
[186:43.07]Uh, let's go back to the other one.
[186:46.74]So we got, uh, we got Civic Doodle.
[186:52.60]Racketeering.
[186:53.77]Survive the internet.
[186:56.15]It is very low.
[187:00.21]Civic Doodle.
[187:02.27]You've been hired to create murals all over Doodle Valley.
[187:06.63]Compete to see who can make the best additions in your attempt to beautify the city.
[187:10.19]Let's do this one.
[187:18.80]I don't think we even did this one last time.
[187:25.68]I'm not sure we even did this one last time we played it.
[187:30.68]Uh, I don't think extended timer should be on for this one.
[187:33.40]Because it's already a long time to draw.
[187:35.11]Okay.
[187:39.97]We did do it a bunch of times.
[187:41.67]Yeah, Fireman was the shirt game.
[187:50.81]Yeah, Fireman was TKO.
[187:54.03]That is true.
[187:57.13]Alright, let's try this one once.
[187:58.97]And then we'll do Fibbage.
[188:01.79]And then we'll see where we're at.
[188:05.15]Okay, play a game.
[188:12.37]So, let's get... Let's do mods again.
[188:15.26]I feel like the mods have been adding some fun to this.
[188:20.54]If anybody wants to do it.
[188:22.96]Let me go like this.
[188:28.70]Anybody else that hasn't played on the mod team that would like to play?
[188:36.09]If not, then... I'm pretty sure... Yeah, I think all the mods have played.
[188:47.32]Yeah, let's just go like this.
[188:54.93]Let me get in myself before I put that in the chat.
[188:57.97]That would be a plus.
[189:00.35]For sure.
[189:00.83]Uh, why is that not working?
[189:05.26]Come on now.
[189:06.84]Come on now.
[189:12.04]Come on now.
[189:12.72]There we go.
[189:14.34]Alright.
[189:15.28]Civic Doodle.
[189:21.01]I am in.
[189:24.73]Uh... Grump, do you wanna play?
[189:28.63]Oh, why not?
[189:34.39]Why not?
[189:34.92]If you wanna play, it's there.
[189:36.70]And in ten seconds, I'm gonna put it into the sub-Discord.
[189:45.86]Here it comes.
[189:47.49]In three... Two... One... Go!
[189:54.37]Okay... I think we've got... I think we've got every- I think that no one's been here before.
[190:05.02]Okay... There you go.
[190:15.04]I don't think anyone was here before that I can remember.
[190:17.42]Alright, I get to draw myself.
[190:21.88]Um...
[190:45.19]Okay, let's get some hair.
[190:46.57]Hey look, it's me!
[191:02.54]I'm the audience, you guys don't get to draw.
[191:04.14]Alright, let's go.
[191:13.34]Civic Doodle.
[191:14.20]Hey, guys.
[191:14.92]Hey, guys.
[191:16.97]Welcome to Doodle Valley.
[191:18.63]I'm authorized to give you one hug each.
[191:21.66]Any takers?
[191:23.29]So you have to add to this?
[191:26.41]You have to keep adding to it, right?
[191:27.91]Oh, it's this guy!
[191:28.57]I remember.
[191:47.87]I remember, he's doing the voice.
[191:49.52]I remember this.
[191:50.06]Where's your follow through, pal?
[192:08.41]We believe in a little thing called democracy around here.
[192:12.43]So I'll let two of you make additions to the drawing and your fellow volunteers will vote on who makes better.
[192:17.20]Oh, which one's better?
[192:18.18]Right.
[192:18.70]Okay.
[192:20.34]Oh, and I'm keeping you on a short timer to make sure you don't overthink it.
[192:23.62]Short timer.
[192:24.46]Okay, volunteers.
[192:25.30]Ready?
[192:26.58]Still ready?
[192:27.74]Oh!
[192:28.95]Ready.
[192:29.75]I mean, go.
[192:35.07]Alright, good luck.
[192:37.95]While these two are drawing, the rest of you can express your feelings about their work with the buttons on your device.
[192:43.81]This is very short.
[192:48.34]What?
[192:51.64]What is going on?
[192:52.66]Tinky Winky.
[192:57.80]Tinky Winky.
[193:00.06]You took up the whole space.
[193:01.48]You took up the whole space.
[193:05.18]This balloon head.
[193:06.80]This person's a balloon.
[193:08.00]I don't know, it's tough.
[193:18.76]Oh shit, somebody's getting 50 bucks.
[193:21.30]Carlos the Clam, thanks for the 50 dollars.
[193:26.17]50 bucks from Carlos the Clam.
[193:31.25]Turn the volume down!
[193:32.63]That's right, I forgot it was loud, right?
[193:35.72]This is the loud one.
[193:36.58]Uh, here's a $50 bribe to let me in the next game.
[193:38.45]No bribes.
[193:38.73]No bribes work.
[193:39.23]But thank you so much for $50, dude.
[193:56.44]That sounds like somebody's desperately trying to do Meatwad and Donald Duck at the same time.
[194:04.40]Alright, so let's see.
[194:04.98]What are you gonna add to it?
[194:10.52]What's going on?
[194:11.44]What are you adding?
[194:13.67]What can you even add to this?
[194:18.53]Horns and hair.
[194:25.86]Is he crying?
[194:27.88]It's voting time!
[194:30.80]I... I don't know.
[194:32.28]Horns and Crying or Bart Simpson.
[194:45.74]Let's see how that shook out.
[194:48.92]Flux the audience.
[194:51.55]Where'd you go?
[194:52.01]Wow, that was... That's gonna keep happening.
[194:55.51]The most confusing drawing.
[194:56.47]Oh, wow.
[195:17.30]Alright, what are you gonna add?
[195:20.00]You got horns and crying.
[195:28.15]What's this?
[195:28.67]Why is this an eggplant?
[195:32.91]Holy shit!
[195:36.65]What?
[195:39.36]They want the mouth!
[195:43.68]Time to vote!
[195:59.26]Papyrus or Satan?
[196:01.21]Why do you have to do that to us every time?
[196:13.91]That's why I have to turn it down.
[196:15.01]Okay, next up.
[196:47.81]He's catching a snowflake on his tongue!
[196:49.31]Vote away!
[196:51.37]He's crying into his own mouth!
[197:04.09]Never mind.
[197:04.61]I got it wrong.
[197:06.11]Rack up those votes!
[197:09.49]Toss those audience votes in!
[197:23.61]The Y makes perfect sense there too.
[198:02.36]Which one is it going to be?
[198:03.78]Let's vote.
[198:08.53]Disney live at no Jerma.
[198:10.73]Why, as far as I'm concerned, was Sour Blueberry quite a Jerma stream experience?
[198:21.64]What did the audience think?
[198:30.20]Oh, this is the Jerma stream experience.
[198:31.96]You cry into your own mouth.
[198:35.66]Well, there we go.
[198:37.88]Nice job, Cookie.
[198:38.94]Let's go.
[199:02.80]That's the cow.
[199:03.66]He can't hear anything.
[199:04.54]Alright, it looks like there's a couple ways you can take this.
[199:15.91]Making a second ear on the left.
[199:19.35]Playing hangman on the right.
[199:20.91]So we've got bunny and hangman.
[199:28.78]What's the hangman game, though?
[199:35.38]I mean... They're both pretty... That could be... Let's see.
[199:48.39]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[199:51.73]Stream.
[199:52.47]Let me take care of this.
[200:00.02]Alright, I got it.
[200:02.72]It looks like we could play Hangman.
[200:07.64]Drink?
[200:08.86]Uh, let's see.
[200:10.87]Uh, let's... Okay, I gotta get rid of some letters here.
[200:23.51]No!
[200:24.01]No, I gotta get this right!
[200:36.24]Here we go.
[200:40.39]Oh, cool, yeah.
[200:41.97]I'm playing, I'm doing the actual thing.
[200:44.91]You just, how are you going to change this?
[200:46.59]What are you going to do with this?
[200:48.03]Sans Undertale with the eye.
[200:50.21]Okay, great.
[200:51.55]We're playing Hangman over here.
[200:52.88]I love this part.
[201:05.05]Don't even tell me.
[201:10.11]Sans Undertale.
[201:12.07]Yeah, let's play Hangman.
[201:13.75]Not like... Alright, good luck.
[201:20.86]So there's no A's.
[201:23.70]Good luck.
[201:27.96]Not Sans Undertale again.
[201:31.06]No, what the...
[201:37.38]Oh no!
[201:38.70]Why?
[201:42.93]No!
[201:51.15]They're both ruined completely.
[201:54.00]They're both completely fucking ruined.
[201:58.40]I don't know which one is worse.
[202:03.59]I don't- I can't tell you which one is a worse option.
[202:06.43]Susie?
[202:12.99]The left just always seems to have Undertale.
[202:18.09]We can still play Hangman.
[202:18.93]Look, somebody got- There's no S. There's no S, see?
[202:22.05]They just wrote it twice.
[202:23.37]There's no A and there's no S. And that's just what he drew- That's what he drew the first part.
[202:27.83]No A and no S, go for it.
[202:35.11]Oh my god.
[202:49.60]Ass.
[202:50.00]Why?
[202:50.38]Eat ass.
[202:51.58]Yeah, and then like a sand.
[202:53.56]Yeah, good.
[202:54.52]Almost.
[202:55.54]Okay.
[202:56.80]Looks like we got it.
[202:57.88]Hangman.
[202:58.52]Bingo.
[203:00.47]This one's already completed, but this one's no.
[203:02.57]I-
[203:07.06]I mean, that's a pretty good quick drawing, but... This one's still possible.
[203:12.44]But S and A are both already gone.
[203:15.49]The up top means... It's supposed to be A and S have already been... They caused the hangman to go down.
[203:20.85]Now they're up there.
[203:22.71]The only two letters that were supposed to be disqualified are on here.
[203:26.93]What have you done?
[203:28.23]What have you done?
[203:28.67]Oh, that's it.
[203:30.25]Alright, I'm gonna solve it.
[203:34.87]I'm gonna try to solve it.
[203:49.29]That's too many letters.
[203:49.95]Is that too... Oh, fucking whatever.
[204:03.54]Okay, vote for your favorite.
[204:20.40]What was that laugh?
[204:25.50]Why am I so invested in the hangman thing?
[204:28.29]Because that was interesting.
[204:29.43]That was an interesting thing.
[204:31.31]Sans ass 18+.
[204:31.67]Somebody's vandalized a church.
[204:32.97]Okay.
[204:51.99]Oh, I got a special treat for our budding artist, Melvin.
[204:55.97]It's not... Fine.
[204:58.59]What is it?
[204:59.03]You're all so dumb.
[205:00.58]I want to commission you to do a portrait to hang right in town hall.
[205:06.48]Ooh.
[205:12.74]Somebody was trying to play hangman.
[205:14.02]And then someone ruined it.
[205:15.78]I was drawing at the same time.
[205:20.33]If somebody- okay.
[205:23.13]Don't even- don't do it.
[205:24.79]No- everyone's gonna do it.
[205:26.73]Don't do it.
[205:27.95]I know you're going to.
[205:28.71]I know everyone's going to.
[205:31.61]And now, uh, now we have to- oh, I'll do it.
[205:34.17]Oh my god.
[205:39.38]totally sure what he's getting at but let's just start by drawing some eyes any eyes you want
[206:26.23]Nobody did it!
[206:26.91]I'm the only one!
[206:28.29]Only two of us did it!
[206:31.01]I was trying to stop it!
[206:33.05]I thought everybody was going to do it, so I was just... I was like, if you can't beat him, join him, and it ended up being two people did it.
[206:55.29]And now, and now, good.
[206:57.31]Thank God.
[207:30.56]I'm done, whatever.
[207:31.62]Fuck it.
[207:32.38]Fuck this.
[207:45.47]What the hell are these?
[207:56.96]Audience?
[208:03.12]What?
[208:03.44]How are we supposed to add to this?
[208:37.25]How much time do I have?
[208:46.59]What the fuck?
[208:56.70]Four!
[208:57.26]Fuuuuck!
[208:58.70]Fuuuck!
[209:07.37]You don't think that's funny?
[209:12.10]I got one.
[209:13.88]I got an idea.
[209:17.54]How about this idea?
[210:04.45]These are all so bad.
[210:22.64]What is this?
[210:23.00]Why did this get 60- 70%?
[210:31.85]Oh, it's the green screen.
[210:33.47]Oh, I get it.
[210:34.25]I get it.
[210:34.63]I get it.
[210:38.40]Makes sense.
[210:39.30]Let's see.
[210:39.88]Saved.
[210:40.20]Nice job.
[210:41.28]Nice job, Sue.
[211:04.88]Save it!
[211:05.56]Oh no!
[211:07.46]Wait, do you get to draw?
[211:13.11]What do you get to draw at the end?
[211:18.77]Free... Who's drawing?
[211:20.93]Who's drawing right now?
[211:23.31]Free iPad.
[211:24.07]Why can't I not draw?
[211:25.43]I can't draw.
[211:26.07]Oh my god.
[211:42.99]This really is perfect music for the end here.
[211:58.69]Unplug it.
[212:02.83]Come on, what can you get?
[212:03.41]What can you get?
[212:04.19]Three seconds.
[212:04.65]One.
[212:05.53]Two.
[212:06.41]Three.
[212:06.91]One.
[212:07.93]Two.
[212:08.87]Three.
[212:09.85]One.
[212:10.79]Two.
[212:11.71]Three.
[212:13.57]Actually pretty quick.
[212:14.15]Alright, let's get new players.
[212:21.04]YouTube annotation spam.
[212:22.82]Yeah, that's really... You're right.
[212:24.52]That one was fun.
[212:27.76]I want to do it again.
[212:38.21]Any of the mods want to join in civic doodle?
[212:40.45]Let's do this one one more time and then we'll go play probably, I don't know, one or two more?
[212:57.96]Let's play.
[213:02.68]This one's fun.
[213:05.54]Don't unhide that yet.
[213:08.10]Alright, I'm going to put it into the... I'm going to see if any of the mods want to play this time.
[213:12.92]Let's see if they'd like to join.
[213:14.50]You got about 5 to 10 seconds.
[213:18.36]Before that goes into subs.
[213:30.50]Hold on.
[213:31.34]Almost.
[213:35.34]I am in.
[213:39.24]Alright, here we go.
[213:44.63]Three, two, one.
[213:47.43]Go for it.
[213:49.15]Alright, let's see.
[213:51.93]Uh, I see.
[213:56.33]Ah, I'm sorry everybody.
[213:57.85]I see people that were here before.
[213:59.17]Let's do it again.
[214:02.07]I think there were at least one or two people that were there before.
[214:08.92]Here we go, let's do it again.
[214:09.70]Let's do it again.
[214:17.53]Quickly now, with the swiftness, let's go.
[214:19.77]Let's try it again.
[214:24.93]And not gonna give you any time, not gonna give you any time, go!
[214:34.39]I think... I think we're good.
[214:38.90]I think we have nobody here before.
[214:48.98]Oh, I actually didn't get to... I didn't get a chance to see.
[214:53.10]Because everyone started drawing.
[214:55.90]So now I don't know who's in here.
[214:57.18]But, okay.
[214:59.42]I think we're good.
[215:05.06]So I saw like these two.
[215:06.76]I was like, oh, no, but...
[215:08.82]And then we start drawing.
[215:12.08]Yeah, I'm putting it in the Discord, in the sub Discord.
[215:14.52]Alright, now let me put a, let's see, let's see, let's see.
[215:23.67]Oh, the audience is in again.
[215:33.31]There, that's just my name.
[215:34.37]Alright, let's go.
[215:42.02]Hello?
[215:43.88]Welcome to Doodle Valley.
[215:45.38]The one city Anthony Bourdain still refuses to visit.
[215:49.36]Oh, we'll get him, alright.
[215:51.04]The traps have been set.
[215:52.38]Where should we spread artistic joy today, Mr. Mayor?
[215:55.01]I can't skip.
[215:57.41]Skip!
[215:58.63]Is there a no skip?
[215:59.35]I don't think there is.
[216:02.77]Alright, here we go.
[216:03.41]Keep in mind, I'm putting you on a short timer so you don't get lost in artistic thought.
[216:08.20]Okay, everybody.
[216:09.38]Ready?
[216:11.47]Good luck to you.
[216:42.47]I wanna play- Oh, that's Tetris.
[216:44.29]That's... That's pretty good.
[216:45.65]That's pretty good.
[216:46.69]That's pretty good.
[216:47.83]Whatever.
[217:14.28]I want to play Hangman, and nobody wants to play Hangman with me.
[217:20.58]Nobody wants to play... They want to play Tetris instead of Hangman.
[217:23.74]Alright, what are you going to do with Tetris?
[217:37.57]I'm curious to see how this... Somebody's just going to do Tetris.
[217:41.50]Just continuously do it.
[217:44.83]No, apparently not.
[217:45.99]That was under the assumption we were gonna get an actual game of Tetris.
[217:53.03]Is this... What is going on?
[217:56.87]Is that supposed to be legs?
[218:03.09]Well, it's either legs or... I don't know what this is and then... Is that supposed to be like Rick?
[218:07.67]That's Rick from Rick and Morty.
[218:08.83]He was gonna write, this is Rick.
[218:16.13]Alright, so we got a guy with... This guy with legs.
[218:32.68]Congratulations, good luck.
[218:36.20]How is that Rick?
[218:37.32]I don't know, it just is.
[218:38.12]Alright, good luck.
[218:42.49]What are you gonna do with the...
[218:45.68]Adding hair.
[218:46.90]Or an antenna.
[218:48.20]I think it is an antenna.
[218:49.86]Turning this into a television, maybe?
[218:51.11]TV?
[218:55.19]Um... I don't know.
[219:07.01]Okay.
[219:08.79]The arms!
[219:20.13]What are those arms?
[219:24.68]Those are the biggest, most buff, fluffy arms.
[219:35.19]Let's start as Tetris turned into this.
[219:41.59]Alright.
[219:46.72]Good luck.
[219:47.18]I'm really focusing on the face on this one and not necessarily the rest of the body.
[219:53.04]Uh... I don't- what's this?
[220:01.12]Is somebody- is that a person?
[220:02.28]The person's climbing on top.
[220:11.53]TV Sans.
[220:13.63]I know I- I didn't- I cut- I was too- I was too much in shock.
[220:41.08]What are we even drawing here?
[220:42.32]That's supposed to be an arm?
[220:44.12]Where's it going?
[220:45.16]Alright.
[220:45.48]Um...
[221:16.66]There you go, I guess.
[221:18.18]Now vote for your favorite.
[221:34.00]I don't... I don't know.
[221:36.54]I can't even, man.
[221:39.26]Add in the audience.
[221:42.74]LucasFramer crushed by 300 pound TV.
[221:50.23]That's not an ice cream shop.
[221:53.82]For the love of God.
[222:01.62]Alright.
[222:02.76]Moving on.
[222:03.38]Round two.
[222:04.30]And it was 400 pounds, that's right.
[222:05.70]There's a 450 pound television.
[222:22.95]The start of some kind of circle, or maybe a... Um, an ear?
[222:32.99]That was quick!
[222:33.71]Uh... Let's see...
[222:47.53]See.
[222:49.47]See your face.
[222:57.87]That was really quick.
[222:59.38]And it's the baseline here.
[223:04.86]Where are you going with it?
[223:16.91]Get Jexed.
[223:22.12]So, I need to add to this.
[223:25.40]Good luck to you two.
[223:26.94]Make it happen.
[223:35.82]Uhhh... Chat.
[223:39.23]Chat.
[223:40.41]Rules.
[223:42.37]And then a Sanzai.
[223:45.88]Sans eye on the right.
[223:48.24]And then chat rules on the left.
[223:50.96]And a tooth.
[223:59.37]I think a sans eye at this point is an automatic disqualification.
[224:06.99]Does that make any sense?
[224:11.35]I think that breaks the rules at this point.
[224:16.93]Alright, so chat rules.
[224:29.12]Chat rules.
[224:30.65]Alright, how can I add to this?
[224:31.69]Let me think.
[225:01.84]It's a puppet.
[225:02.38]It's a puppet or a screaming powerful spell.
[225:11.21]Let's see.
[225:11.59]Pretty even, actually.
[225:12.17]Pretty even.
[225:31.58]But, and then 10 shits.
[225:35.41]It looks like we're going for the puppet.
[225:42.77]Chat rules.
[225:44.69]Now is that supposed to be somebody, that, okay, so here, this is what I'm assuming here.
[225:50.22]Chat... rules.
[225:53.43]Well, see, the chat... you are the person there, right?
[225:58.81]And the puppet is your avatar on the internet.
[226:03.11]And you're essentially talking through that.
[226:06.47]So this could be made into a very very good piece, actually.
[226:11.14]Chat drools with some...
[226:25.72]No memes!
[226:26.68]No like random... Was that a... Ow!
[226:30.28]No... I don't... I know that's just a thing that... That's like asking... Come on.
[227:14.91]Got it.
[227:17.49]Take your favorite and vote.
[227:35.08]Me.
[227:36.56]Me chat.
[227:39.06]And the audience?
[227:42.16]Oh, yeah, sure.
[227:45.26]Sure.
[227:45.56]It's time for Final Jeopardy!
[227:49.92]Final Jeopardy.
[228:15.62]I'm going to try really, really hard on this one.
[228:18.08]I'm going to give it my best.
[228:35.15]No sans or censored.
[228:37.53]That's right.
[228:37.95]If you put down sans, you're getting censored.
[229:23.46]Okay, no sans, good.
[229:24.70]This one's like upside down.
[229:35.88]That one's- is that an upside down image?
[229:44.53]Alright, looks like we're going- nobody wanted mine.
[229:50.41]Looks like we're going with this one.
[229:53.93]Hmm...
[230:34.84]Okay.
[230:38.86]Wait, why is mine not colored in?
[230:40.10]I colored it in, there we go.
[230:41.16]Everyone adds boogers.
[230:48.45]Everybody.
[230:49.89]Everyone adds boogers.
[230:53.69]It's the easiest thing to do, it really is.
[231:05.33]Hmm, add a mouth.
[231:45.73]Fucking no.
[231:54.14]I don't know.
[232:02.44]He's sticking his finger in the nose.
[232:07.11]Nobody fucking voted for me, mine was so bad.
[232:16.55]This actually is looking pretty good.
[232:57.88]I'm trying- I'm trying to get like an a- an a- whatever.
[233:00.76]I was trying to add legs.
[233:04.64]This is too fast.
[233:09.65]Don't fuck with that one.
[233:10.91]Fucking Jesus.
[233:13.11]No.
[233:17.45]Ugh.
[233:28.76]Thrust your teeth if you don't want to go to fucking jail.
[233:35.98]That actually looks pretty good.
[233:37.34]Good job, Jex.
[233:37.70]You did it.
[234:01.00]Hey, look!
[234:01.94]We can draw whatever we want!
[234:11.63]Draw sans and you get perma-banned.
[234:16.81]Alright, let me, uh... Let's do one more thing.
[234:19.01]That one's drawing like a penis, right?
[234:23.83]I'm getting out of here.
[234:28.54]Congratulations.
[234:30.41]Thanks for playing.
[234:31.11]That one's fun.
[234:34.41]So, let's do... We can do Fibbage.
[234:38.58]Fibbage is fun.
[234:43.02]How about this?
[234:43.52]We'll do Fibbage, and then we'll do Monster Seeking Monster one more time.
[234:59.50]Let me make sure these settings are correct.
[235:01.12]Full screen mode is on.
[235:02.80]Family friendly.
[235:04.14]Put the timers on for this one.
[235:05.24]Why not?
[235:06.59]I can censor bad things if they show up.
[235:09.21]That's good.
[235:09.75]Okay.
[235:12.41]Play Fibbage.
[235:13.55]Enough about you.
[235:15.43]No, let's just do the regular one.
[235:26.48]Okay.
[235:26.58]Okay.
[235:28.03]So, let me, uh, see if anyone wants to play.
[235:34.17]Let me get this in there.
[235:35.47]Dude, I've just seriously been just slamming cokes this whole time.
[235:41.23]This is like, I'm gonna have to go on my, I'm going on my third coke.
[235:46.81]Uh, why can't I... I'd like to unhide this, please.
[235:51.19]There we go.
[235:53.61]I'll put it in the mod chat just in case somebody in the mod team would like to play.
[236:04.10]Okay.
[236:07.20]But I've had to piss every hour on the hour.
[236:10.40]This will be piss number three coming up.
[236:13.48]How does the audience join?
[236:14.58]You're going to just go to jackbox.TV and type this code that you see on the screen into the room code and you can participate if you want.
[236:24.99]Alright, let's go into the sub chat.
[236:31.00]Good luck.
[236:36.35]Alright.
[236:37.43]We've got pretty much all new people, I think.
[236:40.59]We do.
[236:42.77]So now, I'm going to go like this, and piss, and I will be right back.
[236:49.00]Just be-

[239:05.54]What's wrong with my chair?
[239:06.40]Oh No
[239:19.05]Here's the code if you wanna join in.
[239:20.65]That's what you get to do.
[239:21.31]Alright, round one, Fibbage.
[239:22.03]It's about lying.
[239:22.81]I do this 85% of the time I ever talk.
[239:24.63]I think I'm gonna be pretty good at this.
[239:49.01]Choose a category.
[239:57.83]This isn't the Friends version?
[240:00.46]I don't think so.
[240:01.38]I think this is the regular one.
[240:03.34]Boston Red Sox.
[240:04.26]Hmm.
[240:04.78]Interesting.
[240:05.66]He sliced open his butt cheek when he slid into second with this in his pocket.
[240:48.43]Oh, enter your lies.
[240:57.74]Write something quick or use the lie for me button.
[241:05.17]Lie for me.
[241:06.79]Googling?
[241:09.55]Google, I just typed in the... What are you talking about?
[241:11.77]Look for the truth and tap it on your device.
[241:17.58]I mean, he has false teeth, fake teeth, uh...
[241:47.75]His Magnum Dong.
[241:50.47]Well, that's definitely not the answer, considering he's not Frank Reynolds.
[241:57.66]That was mine.
[242:04.24]Yeah, come on, that's... You know, sometimes you get the hunger bites here, you know what I mean?
[242:12.25]Tuna can lid is sharp as fuck, by the way.
[242:14.27]Be careful with those.
[242:22.10]If that was true, I would say there's no way in hell.
[242:28.32]That's it, right?
[242:30.72]That would make some sense.
[242:31.68]What was it, fake teeth?
[242:37.76]What, did two people Google it?
[242:39.36]Is that what happened?
[242:40.02]That's the audience's lie, okay.
[242:52.39]So we got a couple of Googlers.
[242:57.05]I won't say it really bit him in the ass, but well, too late.
[243:02.24]Fake teeth, false teeth.
[243:12.07]He slid into second base with an fake teeth.
[243:20.92]Time to look at this.
[243:21.74]As they... Uh... I don't know...
[243:49.91]Yeah, you guys get to pick one.
[243:52.59]In the audience, you get to put your own lie up.
[243:58.45]As long as you all can come to a consensus that it... Hurry, use the lie for me button if you're stuck.
[244:05.44]Alright.
[244:14.42]Depicting... Okay, take a look and find the truth.
[244:22.34]Are you talking to me?
[244:30.42]I... I don't know.
[244:36.83]I don't know.
[244:43.79]Expand their brains.
[244:45.97]Meditate.
[244:49.20]Go stunning.
[244:50.20]Ride a frog.
[244:59.91]Expand.
[245:00.73]The aud- That's the audience?
[245:08.75]That's what you guys picked?
[245:10.99]What the fuck?
[245:15.35]What?
[245:21.64]Wow.
[245:25.06]Meditate- So what is it then?
[245:27.40]Riding a frog?
[245:28.34]Eating a frog?
[245:30.64]It's not expanding their brains.
[245:37.30]It's probably ride a catfish.
[245:41.22]Or... Is it ride a frog or ride a catfish?
[245:46.20]No.
[245:50.41]Is him eating a frog?
[245:51.79]I mean... Okay, well... That's it.
[245:59.83]He's riding on a catfish.
[246:08.94]It has whiskers.
[246:10.20]Oh, we got a Googler in here among us.

[247:18.36]Mine's the worst.
[247:19.74]I hope nobody votes for mine because it really is the worst one here.
[247:22.09]It's pro- it's probably, honest to God,
[247:39.41]I mean, like, it has to be one of these fucked up answers.
[247:45.79]Hold on, is it?
[247:46.79]It might be.
[247:54.91]Motley Crue is a rock band from the 80s, yeah.
[248:07.39]Motley Rand applesauce.
[248:09.41]Wait, hold on.
[248:13.11]Is it applesauce?
[248:15.13]Nobody could type that in.
[248:17.99]Nobody has a keyboard that's capable.
[248:19.31]Nobody knows what... It's like Alt-1-4-2 or something, right?
[248:22.99]1-4-1 to do that.
[248:25.01]Nobody knows that.
[248:25.67]I told you mine was the worst one.
[248:35.55]I fucking panicked.
[248:42.55]You motherfuckers.
[248:50.67]Truck nuts.

[249:43.86]The means.
[249:44.10]No wind.
[249:44.44]There's a place, there's a spot on Earth that has absolutely no wind.
[249:48.50]The odd name of the idea that there's no wind here is this kind of, is this theorem.
[250:19.69]There it is.
[250:24.49]No, it's not the... It's not the... We got half the people here who have no idea what to write.
[250:46.24]Alright, I got... The name of this... The odd name of this is the area above Jerma because he's so short.
[250:59.89]Absolutely, that's what it is.
[251:01.42]That's definitely what this one is.
[251:03.60]That's a pretty good one.
[251:05.66]No Windiness effect thingy.

[251:25.55]No, it can't be, right?
[251:30.42]It's okay to be insecure.
[251:34.74]No wind here.
[251:36.80]Oh, that's too bad.
[251:41.37]El Nino.
[251:50.01]What is that?

[252:23.37]The hairy ball.
[252:24.55]Googling.
[252:24.79]Well, the whole point is you're supposed to make it up.
[252:45.69]You're supposed to lie.
[252:49.15]You're not supposed to put the truth up there.
[252:50.83]Scented bottoms.
[252:58.19]Scented soy candle with the name the bottom of blank.
[253:01.45]Scented soy candle with the name the bottom of

[255:00.42]The bottom of St.
[255:01.49]Louis.
[255:07.07]The bottom of Satan's shoe!
[255:10.77]What?
[255:15.15]I don't get it.
[255:15.67]That ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
[255:34.46]You can't be in the... The bottom of mom's purse?
[255:42.42]Hey, what's the question?
[255:44.86]What is that candle called?
[255:46.54]Give me a category.
[256:08.11]There's a cockroach in here.
[256:09.21]Cappadocia region was surprised to find... While renovating his home... This man was surprised to find... I... I wonder...
[256:55.63]Yeah, I already know.
[256:56.78]I already know.
[256:58.16]I already know what's gonna happen.
[257:01.94]And I'm gonna censor all of them.
[257:03.59]They're all getting censored.
[257:08.23]Alright, find the truth.
[257:13.78]While renovating his home, the Turkish man found, he was very surprised to find, a tunnel, a stash of rare comic books, a skeleton that his home had already been renovated, the corpse of a dwarf, a rat cave, a wall dad, a lost city, or a grenade.
[257:48.96]Censor it all.
[257:52.98]And what did people pick?
[257:54.30]A skeleton.
[257:57.82]If this was the audience, I'm gonna be mad.
[257:59.25]Thank god.
[257:59.67]A wall dad.
[258:06.81]No, no wall dad in there.
[258:08.31]A tunnel.
[258:14.02]That was a good one.
[258:18.79]Nobody voted for it.
[258:22.33]That his home had already been renovated.
[258:26.23]What are you, knock down the wall and there's like a pristine wall behind it?
[258:30.16]And you all just got fucking destroyed.
[258:31.94]I mean, we're talking like absolutely destroyed.
[258:40.52]Oh, and you guys got destroyed by Graveyard.
[258:42.20]A lost city.
[258:50.08]I don't understand.
[258:52.24]You found a city in your house.
[258:57.09]Is this Fraggle Rock?
[259:01.87]How big is the city?
[259:06.27]Final Fibbage coming up.
[259:12.14]In a post-game interview, Ghanaian football star Mohamed Anas turned some heads by thanking both blank and blank.
[259:20.80]Alright, type in your lies.
[259:31.52]Uh, let's see.
[259:35.74]Uh... It's probably... That's not a lie, though.
[259:38.52]You know, it could be...
[259:57.16]I don't know.
[260:12.24]I think this is the first Fibbage question that I actually know.
[260:20.01]Turn some heads by thanking these two things.
[260:28.90]Okay, uh, his wife and his girlfriend, his trainer and his wife's killer?
[260:33.56]What the fuck?
[260:35.42]Satan and God, himself and himself, Spider-Man and Venom, priest and rabbi, foot and ball?
[260:44.81]What the fuck are these?
[260:47.27]It might be this.
[260:48.67]It actually might be this.
[260:56.58]Like, it really could be that.
[261:18.78]Alright, let's see it.
[261:19.58]I think I got it right.
[261:24.36]Foot and ball is Miracy.
[261:27.50]Incorrect.
[261:30.88]Uh, a priest and a rabbi?
[261:32.48]Nope.
[261:36.50]Uh, it's definitely not this one.
[261:43.24]Spider-Man and Venom.
[261:46.08]Whatever.
[261:49.18]His trainer and his wife's killer.
[261:53.48]Why did you guys come up with that?
[261:55.56]Himself and himself, right?
[261:58.34]Aw, come on.
[262:01.56]Satan and God.
[262:02.60]This could be the other one.
[262:04.34]No.
[262:10.89]No.
[262:11.37]So wait, hold on.
[262:12.25]It's... His wife and his girlfriend.
[262:19.49]Hope he remembered to thank his divorce lawyer.
[262:21.59]Oh.
[262:26.03]Right.
[262:26.71]Hey, thank you for playing!
[262:34.71]Congratulations.
[262:39.04]I like how the leaves, we actually write them.
[262:41.62]No, I know you don't write them.
[262:42.84]How would you be able to do it?
[262:54.24]Thanks for playing, guys.
[262:56.02]Alright, let's close this out here by doing one more of the Monster Seeking Monster.
[263:08.83]Monster Seeking Monster.
[263:12.55]And then we are going to close it for the night.
[263:16.08]And you'll see me tomorrow.
[263:18.16]Tomorrow is Red Dead Redemption 2 online.
[263:21.10]And I think I'm going to try to get a couple people involved.
[263:27.51]I know I've already spoken to Vinny.
[263:30.07]Me and Vinny at least are going to try to get in and play.
[263:34.33]And then Sunday, the day after that, is movie night.
[263:38.39]Green screen movie night.
[263:40.66]So we got a 1, 2, 3.
[263:42.60]Friday, Saturday, Sunday here.
[263:48.53]When am I going to start streaming?
[263:50.27]I, for tomorrow, I really don't know because I kind of have to see what Vinny's schedule is.
[263:56.83]What his plan is and if he's going to be around.
[263:59.47]So, we will, he usually starts a little later.
[264:03.99]So, I might not start until a little bit later tomorrow night.
[264:08.70]But then Sunday, Sunday we'll be starting at around 4 p.m.
[264:12.06]Pacific.
[264:13.50]It's probably the best time to start that, around 7 p.m.
[264:15.18]Eastern.
[264:17.23]So, we'll see.
[264:19.57]Let's play Monster Seeking Monster.
[264:26.69]Are there any... Let's see.
[264:29.43]Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.
[264:39.25]Monster Seeking Monster.
[264:47.26]I need to... I almost did it.
[264:49.84]Okay.
[264:53.45]Anybody in the mod chat want to play Monster Seeking Monster?
[264:56.51]There is the code.
[265:02.31]Come on in.
[265:06.13]This is the last one of the night.
[265:08.19]See you tomorrow if you're taking off.
[265:10.55]Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer.
[265:16.91]Make sure I get into this as well.
[265:19.27]Alright, Moo is going to join us.
[265:22.55]And good luck to you guys.
[265:30.03]Do we have anybody that's already been in?
[265:33.99]We do.
[265:35.11]We do, unfortunately.
[265:36.29]We have to do it again.
[265:39.35]We do.
[265:40.59]There are at least one or two.
[265:43.01]I'm going to go for it again.
[265:51.03]Uh, Moo will give it to you again.
[265:52.05]Here you go, Moo!
[265:56.62]And here you go, subs!
[266:08.48]Give it a go!
[266:10.28]One, two, three!
[266:16.14]I think... I think we got... Oh, let's see.
[266:20.94]Pretty sure nobody has played yet from here.
[266:23.92]I don't think so.
[266:25.34]Not that I can remember.
[266:27.54]You can kick them.
[266:28.41]You cannot kick, unfortunately.
[266:32.13]There is no kicking.
[266:38.89]At least from what I can see.
[266:39.85]Alright, so here we go.
[266:42.70]Monster seeking monster, that's the room code.
[266:45.06]Everybody's in, everybody's ready.
[266:45.96]I think, Moo, you have to press start.
[266:48.79]Because you came in first and I came in after.
[266:53.51]Jerva should be out of here.
[266:54.61]He's been in every game.
[266:57.47]Yeah, I know.
[266:57.89]It's that guy's problem, anyways.
[267:04.51]And by the way, the audience gets to very much participate in this game.
[267:08.46]So, this is probably the most audience engagement out of probably all the games so far.
[267:14.50]So, if you'd like to play, join it.
[267:16.16]Let's do it.
[267:20.84]Hello there, and welcome to Monster Seeking Monster.
[267:24.40]I'm your host, Felicia the Teeth Nasher, which is why I have this return- She's a game hog.
[267:29.66]I'll be hosting six nights of putrid pairings.
[267:32.49]Well, that is true.
[267:33.21]I didn't, uh... I skip it.
[267:34.55]Skip!
[267:34.85]I actually didn't play in the first game.
[267:36.71]You're right.
[267:37.77]That's true.
[267:38.41]You are correct.
[267:38.83]At the end of the game, we have some eager little monsters.
[267:40.57]Okay, then.
[267:51.27]Ah, there you go.
[267:51.83]Moo, there you go.
[267:54.15]Alright, this time I plan on dating so many people.
[267:57.27]You don't have any idea.
[267:59.49]Let's start the chat.
[268:00.31]Stream delay is real.
[268:01.04]Alright.
[268:29.16]Oh, the audience's first message is automatically sent to everyone each night, and it shows up here on the screen too.
[268:36.26]Isn't that fun?
[268:54.13]Did I mention that your secret conversations might be seen by everyone during the dates?
[269:10.25]Why am I so dumb?
[269:23.19]I'm so stupid.
[269:24.61]I actually...
[269:26.55]You only get four messages, and I did three.
[269:28.97]And I'm trying to respond to one other person.
[269:31.57]But I fucked up the spelling, and I corrected it just out of... That's just what my brain does.
[269:36.90]Oh, sorry, like, with the asterisk for me to change that, I fucked that up.
[269:41.54]There goes all four.
[269:42.30]20 seconds.
[269:59.98]Now, on your device, pick the one person you hope you're going on a date with tonight.
[270:06.53]Oh, this is so romantic.
[270:08.55]Sorry, I'm a bit of a gooey-goo.
[270:10.63]Choose who you're going to date.
[270:12.99]Let's go.
[270:17.63]Okay, let's see who picked who and who, you know, didn't.
[270:21.45]And if you don't get a date, don't worry.
[270:23.15]This is just the first night.
[270:25.40]Mm-hmm.
[270:27.12]Audience wants to date Jerma.
[270:30.00]I want to get back together.
[270:30.92]When I think of you, I think about money.
[270:32.76]Not what you're talking about.
[270:34.54]What's your first memory of Jerma985?
[270:36.76]That's right.
[270:40.25]You guys make me think about my memory.
[270:41.55]You guys make me bring up the first time I ever streamed.

[271:37.94]Okay.
[272:05.10]Hey, if you need to block another player from messaging you, when you hit the info button on their chat screen, you can also find a block button so you won't see their messages.
[272:51.79]Oh, we're just having lots of love over here.
[273:10.06]Time's up!
[273:13.66]What's up with- WHAT?!

[275:16.47]I can't wait for everybody to laugh.
[275:20.03]Because she's little.
[275:23.90]Look at her.
[275:24.50]Look at her.
[275:25.06]She's so little.
[275:26.92]She's so little.
[275:30.80]Oh, by the way, there's a full moon out tonight in case that affects your monster power.
[275:39.41]Get to messaging!
[275:59.51]What did I just do?
[276:00.59]If you don't see a lot of audience messages appear on the screen, that probably means they're not getting a lot of messages from other players.
[276:49.03]We're down to 20 seconds.
[277:08.78]Okay, time's up.
[277:12.86]Alright, it's time to pick dates again.
[277:17.33]I love just the silence.
[277:24.99]Who wants to date?
[277:26.65]The number one spot.
[277:28.52]That's the question.
[277:30.46]Uh, Spaghetti wants to date Zombie.
[277:36.50]What's your favorite Teletubby?
[277:38.32]Tinky Winky resonates with me.
[277:41.22]If you only get one message from someone, they're probably not that into it.
[277:48.83]Boo means Boo wants to date the audience.
[277:51.35]I can't get butts out of my mind.
[277:52.73]Me either.
[277:53.91]Don't talk to me before I've had my evil.
[277:56.27]So you're looking for a bad boy.
[277:57.64]I'm thinking about dressing as a locust for Halloween.
[278:00.28]Can't believe you just rejected him.
[278:04.52]Zombie.
[278:06.06]I can't get butts out of my mind.
[278:07.26]Sorry, I only do ear- gold child in.
[278:10.47]What?
[278:14.86]Audience asked out- You did.
[278:17.00]I can't get butts out of my mind, you know this isn't gonna work.
[278:22.60]No, this ain't gonna work, guys.
[278:25.00]You knew I was gonna- Yeah, I think we both agree, chat sucks.

[278:46.20]Rejected.
[279:06.57]Ban chat, they suck.
[279:07.77]Alright, everybody knows my superpower, though.
[279:09.85]Let's see, who are you?
[279:11.65]Oh, I definitely don't want to be dating you.
[279:14.29]Hmm.
[279:34.61]Hmm.
[279:36.64]Uh-oh.
[279:40.72]Can we stop thinking about Jerma for a second?
[280:53.90]What's happening?
[280:57.74]What is going on?
[281:03.54]Can't... Hmm.

[281:19.91]Bottom text.
[281:20.65]It's time to pick your date.
[281:24.23]Alright, let's do it.
[281:28.71]The audience is freaking out right now.
[281:30.83]What have you guys done?
[281:37.26]It was a zombie.
[281:38.06]Hey, sorry for betraying you.
[281:38.88]Makeup date.
[281:42.06]Rejected.
[281:45.70]Spoodo.
[281:46.76]Please date me.
[281:47.48]Nobody loves me.
[281:48.44]I'm committed.
[281:48.98]Let me prove it.
[281:49.61]X. X. X. X.
[281:54.20]Heart.
[281:55.60]Heart.
[281:57.00]Heart.
[281:57.26]You guys playing Connect Four?
[281:58.28]Well, apparently.
[281:58.80]Oh, that doesn't end well.
[281:59.76]Rejected automatically.
[282:19.45]MooMeansMoo asked out the audience.
[282:21.35]Oh, God.
[282:38.98]I'll tell you my social security number if you hit the date button.
[282:41.70]Hello, please PM me.
[282:43.08]I put a gorilla in a fake gorilla.
[282:44.58]Hey, sorry, PM.
[282:46.28]In a fake looking gorilla costume.
[282:47.82]Profit.
[282:49.01]Real gorilla.
[282:51.77]I can't fucking believe it worked.
[282:53.09]I can't believe it worked.
[283:03.47]That accident- I think he accidentally clicked the date button on me.
[283:06.13]Alright audience, what do you got?
[283:10.59]Your cookie mom.
[283:11.49]Their child does not get a date?
[283:14.46]So who's the- who's your child?
[283:32.13]Only two more.
[283:32.57]Alright.
[284:51.37]I'm really into this whole, uh...
[285:17.36]if I had real human emotions alright let's see what happens right now I know it's hard to choose but if you don't pick anyone you'll be time to see the dates
[285:41.17]Audience is looking for spaghetti.
[285:42.61]Don't worry, I've had plenty of butts.
[285:44.13]I, too, actually want to do it.
[285:45.37]If dung is wrong, I don't want to- If dung is wrong!
[285:48.51]Okay, here we go.
[286:02.16]What do you mean, wait?
[286:09.27]Yeah!
[286:09.83]Thank you!
[286:10.07]Ooh, that's not good.
[286:10.95]Sorry, Boo.
[286:11.25]I can't.
[286:11.43]I'm already taken.
[286:40.41]Giving me free points?
[286:41.79]It's not free points if you earn them with your exceptional dating skills.
[286:45.81]Uh-oh, let's see what we got here.
[286:50.33]I think I could be the child.
[286:51.83]Please let me out of here.
[286:53.62]You don't want a... She's mothering me.
[286:56.06]Rescue.
[286:56.58]Oh my god.
[287:02.72]What just happened there?
[287:07.38]Let's see if any of that changed the central pecking order.
[287:11.01]Wow.
[287:11.49]Somebody cheated?
[287:12.47]This cheating going on here?
[287:14.17]Uh-oh.
[287:14.71]Time for another reveal.
[287:15.79]Alright, what are you able to do?
[287:19.33]Two-faced creep.
[287:21.15]Two-faced creep.
[287:22.07]The creep earns a bonus heart for every player they reject, but only on nights they successfully get a date.
[287:27.87]It can be hard to trust a creep.
[287:29.27]Really is too bad that you guys in chat weren't the creep.
[287:34.16]Because you would have had, what, five, six extra hearts in the first round?
[287:37.57]Here we go.
[287:37.99]Final night.
[287:38.53]Hmm.
[287:38.71]Hmm.
[288:13.11]Hmm...
[289:02.92]22nd morning.
[289:03.36]Oh, sorry.
[289:04.44]Time's up.
[289:05.20]Once again, it's time to pick your date.
[289:29.42]Ooh, I've got butterflies in my stomach.
[289:31.86]Literally, I ate a lot of butterflies.
[289:35.30]Give me the victory!
[289:41.02]Okay, let's see.
[289:42.02]Oh, I accidentally voted for the Chad.
[289:43.70]MooMeesMoo wants to date Sputop.
[289:47.40]Think about hot singles in your local area.
[289:48.94]Click here, fffsingles.com.
[289:51.26]No, he's just a spam.
[289:53.34]You just junk mail.
[289:56.59]Spooda wants to take the audience.
[289:57.55]What about whispers?
[289:58.97]Chad walks over to you.
[289:59.89]I'll whisper everything.
[290:00.63]What do you not like about politics?
[290:01.81]Let's forget about these politics.
[290:02.87]What do you say?
[290:04.29]Looks like someone had the same idea.
[290:06.76]Let's see how this works out.
[290:10.62]Oh, man.
[290:11.20]Uh-oh.
[290:15.98]Last chance, Chad.
[290:16.76]I need a redemption arc.
[290:17.70]What do you not like about politics?
[290:18.98]How political this streamer is.
[290:20.38]Knock, knock.
[290:20.76]Who's there?
[290:21.22]The past.
[290:25.21]Oh, you get double hearts too.
[290:26.63]Isn't that cute?
[290:31.45]You're mine.
[290:31.93]Mine!
[290:32.33]You don't even know!
[290:33.05]I always was.
[290:39.02]What's that person's name in chat?
[290:39.92]I want them permanently banned from the channel.
[290:43.69]Give me your ghost power.
[290:44.67]I'll pick you no matter what.
[290:46.27]I got you.
[290:47.25]Want some ectoplasm.
[290:48.63]Yeah, slam through the wall.
[290:50.27]Oh, but what about me?
[290:55.63]Yeah.
[290:55.97]Yeah, that's what you deserve.
[290:56.93]That's what you deserve.
[290:59.23]You deserve that.
[291:04.73]Hey, Chad.
[291:05.25]Wanna do it.
[291:06.29]You bet.
[291:06.69]I won't... Do what?
[291:09.65]It wasn't even Chad, though.
[291:10.59]It was this weird guy.
[291:15.00]Wow.
[291:15.46]You guys switched.
[291:16.96]Did I get enough hearts?
[291:21.64]I wonder.
[291:22.02]Mom's not gonna win, right?
[291:22.84]What do you mean?
[291:24.26]The... body swapper?
[291:24.90]Oh, shit.
[291:25.24]I think I dated them, like, twice.
[291:45.30]Everyone the zombie dates turns into a zombie, and everyone new zombies date also turn into a zombie at the end of the next night.
[291:51.95]At the end of the game, if everyone has been infected, it's the end of the world.
[291:58.51]Oh, God.
[292:00.81]Here's the Monster Hunter.
[292:02.03]At the end of the game, the Monster Hunter gets a bonus heart for every time they date the monster type they've secretly been told to hunt.
[292:09.60]How could you betray me?
[292:11.68]Glob!
[292:12.16]Uh-oh.
[292:13.91]Every time the Glob successfully dates three new players, its heart tally doubles.
[292:19.58]Did Wu get it?
[292:22.76]Who is the Monster Hunter hunting this whole time?
[292:25.02]The body swapper.
[292:27.14]The body swapper?
[292:29.32]That's not a monster, is it?
[292:30.42]No.
[292:30.52]Oh, it is.
[292:33.05]How does that affect the final standings?
[292:37.25]Nope.
[292:37.49]Oh, God.
[292:37.73]I hope not.
[292:38.51]Oh, shit.
[292:38.81]That's... Okay, thank God.
[292:39.57]We only have two hearts.
[292:40.33]Fuck.
[292:40.63]Swooped in and dated a player that had just been rejected three times.
[293:03.84]That's what I did.
[293:05.04]We both won.
[293:06.28]Swapped all hearts at once.
[293:09.03]It was a tie.
[293:11.13]Nice work.
[293:14.79]Inflicted three lost hearts of damage on players who scorned them.
[293:19.91]We would have been up there.
[293:21.93]Rejected other players two times and earned two hearts.
[293:25.97]I fucking hate this game.
[293:27.59]This is what somebody just wrote.
[293:29.41]Tracked body swapper all game.
[293:30.99]Dated them once.
[293:37.92]Directly infected three players with a zombie virus.
[293:41.44]I'm glad that didn't happen.
[293:45.12]Never quite doubled.
[293:46.38]Sorry, Moo.
[293:52.80]Earned three hearts for each and either child.
[293:54.48]Feistel went dateless.
[293:58.68]And then I won.
[294:00.20]Hooray.
[294:00.68]Alright.
[294:05.48]That brings us to the five-hour mark and the end of tonight's stream.
[294:17.38]That was bullshit.
[294:20.28]I gotta go out on a victory here, right?
[294:21.85]Come on.
[294:23.72]So you will see Jackbox again because there are a couple that I'd like to do with at least a couple of people that are in the call.
[294:34.63]So you'll see it again.
[294:37.09]Probably at some point like the next week or two.
[294:43.63]I'm heartbroken.
[294:47.71]Yeah, we'll do the bits and everything.
[294:48.94]Just be aware that tomorrow there's a stream tomorrow and there's a stream on Sunday.
[294:52.08]We're gonna go three days in a row.
[294:57.54]Tomorrow's Red Dead Redemption 2 online with a friend-o.
[295:02.61]And then the movie night is Sunday at 4 p.m.
[295:06.85]Pacific.
[295:09.69]And with that, thank you for joining me.
[295:12.95]Hope you had fun.
[295:13.81]Thank you for playing.
[295:14.84]Everyone that got a chance to play.
[295:17.02]We will be doing it again soon.
[295:21.88]So let's skedaddle out of here.
[295:25.49]Put on the outro.
[295:26.23]Get rid of that.
[295:27.39]Hey, look at that.
[295:27.99]There it is.
[295:31.71]Let's go back into the bits.
[295:35.30]Oh, the A comes at the end of the stream, boys.
[295:39.36]We had some big donations tonight.
[295:42.26]So, thank you.
[295:44.38]You guys rock.
[295:47.42]If you take it off, see you tomorrow.
[295:48.82]Or the next day.
[295:49.40]Whenever you end up coming back.
[295:51.14]We'd love to have you.
[295:53.04]Hey, HoneyChain, thank you HoneyChain for the $10 here.
[295:57.66]Is this an expense?
[296:00.38]Uh, no.

[296:49.71]I don't... I don't get it.
[296:50.69]What is that?
[296:59.98]It's just my sad face and Hulk Hogan's stomach.

[297:43.63]Where is my mod, dad?
[297:44.93]Don't you love your kids?
[297:49.83]Can't give mod to all the children, understand?
[297:55.13]Hulk Hogan looks like a walrus.

[298:30.16]Hey, Jeremy, big fan of your work.
[298:33.54]You are brilliant, and I love your sense of humor.
[298:37.16]Very, very kind of you to say that.
[298:38.30]Thank you so much.
[298:40.02]He got it?
[298:40.42]Yeah, I've been saying it correctly the last few streams.
[298:46.34]But, that means a lot.
[298:47.86]Thank you so much.
[298:49.08]Hope you stick around.
[298:49.74]There's gonna be more to see.
[298:50.88]Thank you for the $10.
[298:51.72]10 bucks.
[298:55.96]Also, thank you to... Uh... The David Cage for the $1.
[299:02.46]Love you, Dad.
[299:03.36]Hey, thanks a lot.
[299:04.78]Thank you.
[299:06.56]Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the $10.
[299:08.12]Old man is confused by technology.
[299:11.43]Timmy Tim Tam, $10.
[299:12.29]I, you know, technology does confuse me sometimes.
[299:22.34]But I adapt, and I try, and I put my 100% of my brain goes into trying to figure stuff out on stream.
[299:30.64]Sometimes that's I forgot to punch in the game code.
[299:33.78]I'm getting older.
[299:34.73]That happens.
[299:36.17]Thank you so much, Timmy.
[299:38.85]Appreciate the $10.
[299:42.01]We also have... Maxie!
[299:45.95]Thank you, Maxie, for the two bucks.
[299:48.59]Baby Thanos distracts streamer from winning.
[299:53.49]Baby Thanos.
[299:56.26]Earl of Illusion, thanks for the $1.
[299:57.92]Local streamer doesn't know ass from elbow forgets to join his own game.
[300:01.94]I'll take that, yeah.
[300:03.74]That's right, that's true.
[300:08.26]TheLongEgg also says, I forgot to start today's stream by juggling like you promised.
[300:13.06]I don't have anything.
[300:14.62]We're going to the grocery store tonight, and I'm going to get oranges.
[300:18.62]I was going to get oranges to do this.
[300:22.10]So, don't worry.
[300:23.92]You'll see it.
[300:25.52]I just got nothing to juggle.
[300:27.00]And I'm not juggling Coke cans.
[300:28.36]Because if I drop one of those and it explodes, it's going to ruin my room.
[300:32.17]So, I'm sorry.
[300:32.67]All I have is Coca-Cola cans.
[300:37.33]In the whole house.
[300:40.19]You'll see it.
[300:40.57]Don't worry.
[300:41.05]Kill Code.
[300:41.59]Thanks for the $1 Kill Code.
[300:42.79]Hey, it's my birthday today, Jerma.
[300:43.85]I just wanted to say thanks for being a funny guy.
[300:45.35]And I hope you like my video on Sunday.
[300:49.57]There are a lot of submissions.
[300:52.02]And I do need to say this.
[300:54.22]There were hundreds of submissions.
[300:56.70]Hundreds of them.
[300:58.72]And each one was screened and talked about and I just want to make sure everyone's aware that just because if it does not get shown on Sunday does not mean
[301:10.68]Oh, it sucked.
[301:11.58]Oh, I didn't like it.
[301:12.68]No, no, no.
[301:13.71]Just there is some specific guidelines, specific rules, and there were a lot of submissions.
[301:18.29]So... We're not showing every single submission on Sunday.
[301:24.25]Just to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[301:26.71]None of this was a contest.
[301:28.39]It's just which ones fit certain criteria.
[301:31.77]It's not like, this person wins!
[301:32.79]Just want to make that very clear.
[301:36.27]That would be really hard.
[301:37.71]It... it is.
[301:39.76]I don't want to disappoint anybody by saying, oh, sorry, I'm not showing yours, but this is just for the purposes of Sunday.
[301:45.83]Uh, we have to try to keep it as cleaned up as we can, kind of, because this is like the movie night.
[301:54.30]That doesn't mean we're not going to do something like this again.
[301:56.79]So...
[302:04.00]But the mods have done an absolutely fantastic job.
[302:08.08]Double claps here for the mods.
[302:11.22]Because they've been a huge part of this process the whole time.
[302:22.11]Thank you.
[302:24.29]And moving on from that, we also got $5 from Lazy Luke.
[302:27.34]No message.
[302:27.80]Thank you, Lazy Luke.
[302:30.66]And happy birthday, by the way, to Kill Code.
[302:32.54]Happy birthday, dude.
[302:33.89]Hope you had a good one.
[302:35.47]And hopefully it's still your birthday.
[302:37.65]That was a few hours ago, but happy birthday, man.
[302:44.61]But thank you, Lazy Luke, for the $5.
[302:46.13]Thank you, Kill Code, for the $1.
[302:50.10]Thank you also to Marvash Magali for the $1.
[302:53.04]Why is Jackbox crashing, you ask?
[302:55.80]Maybe this is a sign that the green screen isn't dead.
[303:00.70]The green screen will... The green screen lives forever.
[303:05.02]Because it can be anything.
[303:07.28]Anything.
[303:13.68]Thank you.
[303:15.41]Thank you, uh, Dirty.
[303:16.63]Thank you, Dirty Margaret for the $1.
[303:19.43]To the guy who made the Murder House alignment chart.
[303:22.53]If you watched the opening seconds of the Murder House ladder match...
[303:26.22]Please change it.
[303:26.90]Thank you, Dirty Margaret.
[303:28.08]Appreciate it.
[303:56.09]Uh, Carlos the Clam gave $50 earlier.
[303:58.83]Big money, Carlos.
[303:59.81]Thank you.
[304:01.71]Trying to bribe into a game, but that's not how it works.
[304:04.49]That's not how it works.
[304:07.99]I do appreciate the absolutely enormous amount of money, though.
[304:10.68]Thank you.
[304:14.46]Uh, Honey Chain again.
[304:15.38]Thanks for $1, Honey Chain.
[304:16.66]Jerma, I'm drinking boxed rose wine.
[304:19.44]It is the worst thing I've ever had.
[304:21.14]I should have gotten the red blend and spent seven hours building a labo.
[304:26.12]I could have told you that.
[304:30.42]Rose wine over a red blend?
[304:34.33]Come on.
[304:36.95]I mean, that was a big mistake.
[304:37.95]Well, at least you'll know for next time.
[304:43.13]You'll know for next time.
[304:45.51]So thank you, Honey Chain.
[304:46.23]Hopefully you at least got some use out of it.
[304:49.57]Some use out of the wine.
[304:51.53]It was on sale.
[304:52.55]Well, okay, well that, that, whatever.
[304:54.05]If you're gonna, look, if you're gonna buy wine on sale, then you gotta be prepared for the potentially sub-par taste, flavor, and profile it's gonna have, right?
[305:04.12]It's just, there's a very real possibility.
[305:07.89]But thank you.
[305:09.23]Uh, thank you Wyrwood for the one dollar, just dropping a dollar.
[305:11.77]Do you remember that PS2 game with Geo?
[305:13.95]Uh, any chance you'll continue to play it one day?
[305:17.09]The mascot with the Geo- oh yeah, with the big... the big mole creature thing.
[305:21.61]Yeah, that was like the... the disaster game where there's like an earthquake and you try to escape.
[305:28.76]There actually is still about seven or eight PlayStation 2 games that we didn't play.
[305:34.48]And it's just all boxed up and in the closet back here.
[305:38.18]So, there'll be a time, probably sooner rather than later, where there's not a whole lot of releases for games, or if I'm not working on a particular project or something like that, it'll be available.
[305:54.03]So, there's a lot of Dreamcast, a lot of PlayStation 2.
[305:57.15]Could always go back to Monster Rancher 2, because that game was a lot of fun.
[306:07.53]It's very possible.
[306:14.83]It's very possible.
[306:17.77]So, uh, also to... What else we got?
[306:24.83]Timmy Tim Tim again, thanks for the one dollar.
[306:26.76]Do I have anything to declare?
[306:28.20]Oh, I never have anything to declare.
[306:31.10]I don't have anything to declare.
[306:37.97]Oh, hold on a second.
[306:38.87]What is this?
[306:40.49]At the customs.
[306:42.47]Good morning.
[306:43.33]Can I see your passport?
[306:44.58]Certainly.
[306:45.32]Here it is.
[306:46.30]Yes, that's alright.
[306:47.94]Have you got anything to declare?
[306:49.58]Yes, I have.
[306:51.00]I've got some whiskey and some cigarettes.
[306:53.20]How much whiskey have you got?
[306:54.70]A liter.
[306:55.68]That's alright.
[306:56.73]And how many cigarettes have you got?
[306:58.59]Two hundred.
[307:04.35]200?
[307:04.37]200?
[307:04.39]Open your case, please.
[307:06.55]Pardon?
[307:07.49]Open your case, please.
[307:09.08]Open it now.
[307:10.42]Oh, dear.
[307:11.12]Look at this.
[307:11.90]You've got three bottles of whiskey, 400 cigarettes, and a lot of perfume.
[307:16.96]Does that mean I can't go?
[307:20.07]Oh, look at this.
[307:21.97]You've got three bottles of whiskey.
[307:23.55]So, okay.
[307:37.60]What's the difference this time?
[307:39.66]Open your case, please.
[307:40.44]Open your case, please.
[307:43.86]Open it now.
[307:44.24]Oh, dear.
[307:44.42]I love that, does that mean I can't go?
[307:45.84]Yes, that's what it means.
[307:46.76]You can't, you're not, you cannot go.
[307:48.14]Sorry.
[308:09.90]Oh, dear!
[308:11.56]Oh, that's right.
[308:12.24]Hold on.
[308:12.64]That way it's 2.5 speed.
[308:20.26]That's alright.
[308:21.23]Have you got anything to declare?
[308:22.89]Yes, I have.
[308:24.47]I've got.
[308:25.49]And how?
[308:25.89]Open it now!
[308:29.53]Oh, dear.
[308:30.97]Look at this.
[308:32.51]You've got three bottles of whiskey, 400 cigarettes, and a lot of perfume.
[308:42.68]Does that mean I can't go?
[308:50.28]What a treasure trove of just comedy.
[308:54.88]There's so much there.
[308:58.75]to declare.
[308:59.19]Thank you, Timmy.
[309:00.03]Tim Tim.
[309:02.65]Kite So.
[309:03.49]Thank you, Kite So, for the $1.
[309:05.38]Jeremy, your imitation of a keyboard sent my dog into a frenzy.
[309:08.76]My computer monitor is shattered and on the floor and my wife is filing for divorce.
[309:15.26]It was quiet.
[309:16.08]I'm not going to do it again.
[309:17.39]I don't want to break your dog.
[309:18.31]I don't want to send your computer into a frenzy, so I'm not going to do it again.
[309:23.19]But thank you.
[309:24.71]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the one dollar.
[309:26.47]Do you have a goblin body or a football jock body?
[309:31.81]There is no in-between.
[309:34.80]What?
[309:35.94]Extra cheesy, thanks for the two bucks.
[309:37.48]Look, Jeremiah, I found your soulmate.
[309:41.62]She's a funny streamer who says stuff and loves to comb her hair.
[309:49.37]Oh my fucking lord, what the hell...
[309:55.46]Is it?
[310:02.92]Is that me?
[310:05.89]That's me.
[310:07.45]What did you do?
[310:09.35]What is this?
[310:11.11]What is this from?
[310:19.56]It's the face app thing.
[310:21.02]Oh.
[310:27.04]She's... Oh my god.
[310:35.63]Okay, well... Thank you.
[310:40.43]You guys just saw it.
[310:42.25]I just linked it.
[310:44.59]Did I not link it?
[310:45.31]Yeah, I did.
[310:46.67]I linked it.
[310:55.82]Yeah, it's been linked.
[311:00.06]Oh, the music.
[311:01.16]Sorry about that.
[311:02.58]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for that.
[311:03.60]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer, for the $1.
[311:05.48]Watch this.
[311:05.84]Jeremy Goff is going to make this Garfbuck disappear right before your eyes.
[311:09.59]Just going to do the magic words.
[311:12.99]I'm not saying these magic words.
[311:15.35]Absolutely not.
[311:16.13]Dermot, check your wallet.
[311:16.97]You just got an extra Garf buck through the magic of Paws Incorporated.
[311:20.55]Thank you.
[311:20.85]You've been a great audience.
[311:21.77]Hey, Derm, welcome for the backstage pass to Garf's magic show.
[311:25.65]I thought we could get more cats watching.
[311:27.23]Any cartoon cats?
[311:29.17]None of them.
[311:30.18]The only, no.
[311:30.80]Alright, cat dog.
[311:32.06]I want cat dog there.
[311:34.30]That's it.
[311:36.36]Say it.
[311:38.00]I'm not gonna say it.
[311:38.82]I'm gonna link it.
[311:39.52]That's, I'm not saying it.
[311:42.27]It's like, snapity, snoopity, snee, send.
[311:45.59]No, I'm not doing it.
[311:47.96]Thank you for the dollar, Garfield.
[311:49.46]Thank you.
[311:52.00]I want cat dog there.
[311:55.22]Thank you, uh, pockets for the two bucks.
[311:58.16]Pockets.
[312:01.83]A bunch of my friends and I religiously watched you for the past six years.
[312:05.12]So a large part of our friendship has been based around the shit that you've said.
[312:08.62]My one friend showed up at a party with an actual dork cube.
[312:11.80]It was a mess.
[312:13.42]Oh god.
[312:13.92]Anyways, thanks for having such a positive impact.
[312:15.88]We all really appreciate you so much.
[312:17.63]I can't count how many shitty days you've improved.
[312:20.07]Really means a lot.
[312:21.03]P.S.
[312:21.37]Not buying a Gloom Man shirt was the biggest regret of my life.
[312:23.67]What's the plan for those?
[312:24.55]They're coming back.
[312:27.51]There is a plan over the next probably couple months where there might be three shirts to buy.
[312:35.97]Just available for a month or so.
[312:38.54]Like last time, just three of them.
[312:40.08]Just not going to have them come out.
[312:42.90]Oh, this one and then this one and this.
[312:44.02]Just have them all at the same time.
[312:45.26]And if you want them, you want them.
[312:46.20]If not, then you don't, right?
[312:49.02]It's going to happen.
[312:52.62]But thank you so much, Pockets.
[312:55.50]Six years is a long damn time.
[312:59.46]I am absolutely honored that you and your friends can have fun based around some of the things you've seen here.
[313:09.07]So, I'm honored.
[313:14.75]Thank you.
[313:17.03]Thank you eDragon for the $5.
[313:18.65]Thanks for the fun stream.
[313:19.41]Time to start my 14-page paper due Monday.
[313:23.66]Good luck.
[313:24.00]That's a lot.
[313:24.98]That's a lot of words.
[313:27.98]You're gonna be fine, though.
[313:29.08]You'll get it done.
[313:30.62]You'll get it done over the next couple days.
[313:33.07]You'll breeze through it.
[313:34.25]You'll just be on a... You'll go on a spree.
[313:36.69]Trust me.
[313:36.99]You'll be good.
[313:38.91]Thank you, eDragon, for the five bucks.
[313:40.07]Thanks for sticking around.
[313:42.27]Spaghetti Tony, thanks for the five dollars.
[313:44.00]Had a wonderful time playing with you tonight.
[313:46.66]Stay amazing.
[313:47.24]You too.
[313:49.12]Thanks for playing.
[313:51.36]It's always fun to play games like this and try to get people involved, right?
[313:56.02]I don't do it that often, but
[313:58.34]When it's available, it's... Especially when it's easy to do.
[314:02.19]Something like Jackbox, you can just kind of throw it on for a few hours and just play.
[314:06.03]It's not lobbies and... Oh, hold on, I gotta, like, who do, who can I add?
[314:10.41]Just makes it easy.
[314:11.87]So, it's fun.
[314:14.75]Uh, thank you, though.
[314:15.35]Thank you, Fourth Consecutive Line, for the 20 bucks.
[314:19.14]$20 from Fourth Consecutive Line.
[314:21.88]Uh, love you, Jerma.
[314:22.62]Keep being an amazing entertainer.
[314:23.86]Thanks for everything.
[314:24.40]You have no idea how much you've helped me over the years.
[314:28.85]My pleasure.
[314:30.77]Thanks for being here for the years.
[314:33.57]And thanks for your contributions.
[314:37.96]Thank you so much.
[314:40.72]I hope you still enjoy it.
[314:43.00]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[314:44.63]No message, Clueless.
[314:45.39]Thanks a lot, man.
[314:47.10]Super Spy, Burger Flipper, thanks for the $1.
[314:48.72]It was an honor to play with you and chat.
[314:50.20]Love your stuff.
[314:51.32]I was the Jex guy in the drawing game.
[314:53.92]Can't wait for movie night.
[314:55.36]I am so excited.
[314:57.46]I am so excited for movie night.
[315:03.30]That's just going to be like a chill, fun stream just to relax and just watch stuff.
[315:11.13]Sunday evening.
[315:13.39]Uh, Blastoise, thanks for the $1.
[315:14.75]Hey Jerma, have you ever played Spyro?
[315:16.47]The remastered trilogy came out on PS4.
[315:18.09]Highly recommend to fans of the original and new players alike.
[315:21.95]I played the original Spyro for not very long.
[315:28.35]And I didn't experience it at all.
[315:32.37]I think I... I don't know how I got my hands on it.
[315:36.63]I may have like rented it or something.
[315:40.84]Maybe.
[315:42.12]I had- I played it for like a couple hours and I didn't do anything.
[315:46.70]So, I mean, I definitely would play it.
[315:49.80]I'm not sure if I would stream it, but... I don't know, it depends.
[315:55.87]Thank you for the $1 and the recommendation.
[315:58.21]Hey Gonderlane, thanks for the $1.
[315:59.47]I got really close to getting you to play Bookworm Adventures the other day.
[316:02.01]I'll never stop trying you to get it to play it.
[316:04.41]I fight an eternal crusade.
[316:09.27]Add it to... Okay, when I play Lego Island, I'm gonna play Bookwormer Adventures right after it.
[316:16.45]We'll have a most wanted stream.
[316:22.76]Thank you, Gondoline.
[316:24.02]Thank you, Lazy Luke, again for $5.
[316:25.58]No message.
[316:26.08]Thanks for the five bucks, Lazy Luke.
[316:28.64]DoubleD11, thanks for the $1.
[316:29.92]Make a full Jupiter in chat right now.
[316:31.64]I bet you won't be able to.
[316:42.42]I did it.
[316:44.64]Take me and Chalmers.
[316:46.17]Me and Chalmers did it.
[316:48.85]Oh, no.
[316:49.69]I screwed it up.
[316:50.11]It don't matter.
[316:51.73]Well, you win.
[316:53.29]Thank you, Lazy Luke, again for $5.
[316:55.79]$5 again.
[316:56.19]No message.
[316:56.71]Thank you.
[316:57.59]Again, Lazy Luke, $5.
[316:59.33]$5, $10, $15, $20.
[317:01.71]Lazy Luke coming in with $5 over and over again.
[317:03.56]Thank you.
[317:04.76]No messages here.
[317:05.46]It means a lot.
[317:06.76]Thank you so much, man.
[317:11.33]No.
[317:11.53]Well, those of you that have played Dark Souls games, you know that you have to be currently playing a Dark Souls game to be able to play a Dark Souls game.
[317:32.44]You can't play a shitload of Dark Souls for like four or five days straight, and then two months go by and you come back and just go where you left off.
[317:39.68]Oh, no way.
[317:42.74]Mm-mm.
[317:43.12]You gotta be currently playing a Dark Souls game to be able to even consider playing a Dark Souls game.
[317:52.48]It's just the truth.
[317:54.84]But thank you.
[317:56.10]Thank you, Spoodo.
[317:57.54]Did I ever beat him?
[317:58.24]I didn't.
[317:59.80]I didn't.
[318:00.04]Well, I mean, we Mario Party beat him, didn't we?
[318:03.76]Maybe.
[318:08.32]Challenge run?
[318:09.02]I would get too upset.
[318:10.60]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[318:12.93]Thank you, Shoosh, for room for the $1 green screen.
[318:14.90]Man broke into my school and stole my lunch money.
[318:17.52]You need to fix him.
[318:23.23]I can't.
[318:23.53]He can be anywhere.
[318:29.13]Thank you Shoestroom for the one dollar.
[318:31.41]Thank you Darkstar.
[318:32.13]And again, I'm gonna punch home on this again.
[318:58.79]This is not a contest, it's just a chill night where we just play videos that were submitted, that met criteria, that we thought were interesting, or fun, or funny, or cool, you know, or cool, or epic, you know what I mean?
[319:11.63]So, don't worry, it's not, there was no contest or anything.
[319:18.87]But what I have seen, yes, some of them are very, very well made.
[319:25.99]Epic fail.
[319:27.63]I hate that fucking word.
[319:30.30]I hate the word epic.
[319:32.66]I really do.
[319:35.62]But thanks a lot, Darkstar.
[319:40.22]Boxguy.
[319:40.82]Thank you, Boxguy, for the $1.
[319:41.99]Hey, Jeremiah, I joined in during that robot rapping game and sucked real bad.
[319:45.31]Jeremiah Pluto.
[319:45.95]But I'm just glad I finally managed to get into a Jackbox game with my favorite streamer.
[319:51.97]It was all in good fun, Boxguy.
[319:55.85]It was very enjoyable.
[319:57.06]So, thank you.
[320:00.92]Thanks for the fun, Jerma.
[320:02.76]And don't worry, we still love you even though you never beat Pinwheel.
[320:05.14]Thanks, appreciate that.
[320:07.80]You know, maybe one day I will.
[320:10.55]Thank you, Whatscracken, for the $5.
[320:11.91]And lastly, DoubleD11, thanks for the $1.
[320:14.93]Get a Etalyx in here.
[320:17.07]I heard him outside your room.
[320:20.25]He's not there.
[320:21.87]He's in his office.
[320:24.32]Somewhere in this fucking house.
[320:26.24]I have no idea.
[320:26.74]I thought there were like six different doors.
[320:30.06]Let's roll the credits!
[320:31.90]Thanks everybody for sticking around.
[320:32.94]I hope you had fun.
[320:36.33]Looks like there were a shitload of subs tonight too.
[320:41.21]An uncountable amount of people continue to subscribe to this channel every time I stream.
[320:47.03]Returning or new.
[320:52.90]Chat wanted to know how your hair was doing.
[320:54.86]It's doing okay.
[320:58.04]Did somebody gifted a sub to Fortnite?
[321:01.06]Did that happen?
[321:03.96]Why does Fortnite have a sub?
[321:09.67]Fortnite.
[321:11.63]Do you think that anybody at the Fortnite marketing team or whatever or the Twitch channel just opens up who they're subscribed to?
[321:17.95]And there's just hundreds of people they're subscribed to?
[321:28.64]But thank you, all of you.
[321:33.26]I wouldn't be surprised.
[321:37.14]Timmy Tim Tam, does it bother you when people like me make a bunch of donations in one night using 100 bits at a time?
[321:43.36]No.
[321:46.00]No, absolutely not.
[321:49.32]The only time, I mean, the only time where it would ever become an issue is...
[321:56.39]if it starts to become too much, you know what I mean?
[322:01.80]So let's say that as we continue to go here, there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of messages at the end of the night, you know what I mean?
[322:14.21]At that point, it is physically not possible for me to read them all.
[322:17.89]It would take six, seven, eight hours to do that, you know what I mean?
[322:22.75]So if we have to figure out what to do, then we have to figure out what to do.
[322:26.75]If the minimum has to increase, if that has to happen, I try to wait as long as possible before needing to do something like that.
[322:33.89]I will never turn on text-to-speech ever.
[322:37.71]It'll literally never happen.
[322:39.77]So that's not an option.
[322:50.66]Literally.
[322:51.58]Literally.
[322:54.39]Look at all these fucking subs, my god.
[322:56.33]Can you see how many people are here?
[323:00.37]Do you see this?
[323:01.05]You're seeing this, right?
[323:05.38]You guys can see that on the screen.
[323:15.55]Literally.
[323:20.51]Almost every chat member is subbed.
[323:22.13]That is remarkable.
[323:29.59]Hundreds of people subscribed today.
[323:37.02]Thank you guys.
[323:41.24]Sub only mode.
[323:42.50]Sub only mode ain't gonna do very much.
[323:45.82]I mean, think about that.
[323:51.38]Hey, turn on sub only mode!
[323:52.62]Oh, everybody in chat has subbed.
[323:54.26]Oh!
[323:55.06]Alright!
[324:05.09]Thank you guys.
[324:13.10]Thank you for subscribing, thank you for... watching.
[324:17.82]I can only say thanks so many times.
[324:20.26]You know?
[324:20.72]And I've broken record myself a lot.
[324:24.64]I just do.
[324:28.19]But just know that it's appreciated.
[324:29.61]Speaking of subs, Double D... Double D just gave up five community subs.
[324:38.27]Thank you, Double D. Five community subs from Double D right at the end.
[324:47.84]And just like that, right?
[324:48.84]That's five more.
[324:51.67]Oh, and speaking of five, speaking of ten.
[324:54.63]Ten coming in from Kairotobi.
[324:55.89]Ten community subs from Kairotobi.
[325:00.19]Oh my god.
[325:01.73]Kairotobi, you have given a lot of these.
[325:10.22]Five from Double D and then ten.
[325:13.64]Ten people just got subscribed from Kairotobi.
[325:16.32]Thank you, Kairotobi.
[325:20.16]New emotes when?
[325:21.98]I actually think I may have another... I think I have slots now.
[325:25.05]I'm gonna have to look and see what I would want to do.
[325:31.70]But... Kairotope, thank you.
[325:35.49]then thanks all of you for being here.
[325:38.37]And that's the end.
[325:39.33]That's the time.
[325:40.31]I'll see you tomorrow for maybe Red Dead 2 Online.
[325:44.15]I have to talk to a couple people that were involved in maybe setting it up.
[325:50.25]If that does not happen, which it may not happen, I'm going to figure out if it's going to happen or not for a few different reasons.
[325:59.17]If it doesn't, then I'll figure something out.
[326:02.60]We'll figure something out for tomorrow.
[326:06.08]So don't worry.
[326:07.52]There'll be a stream tomorrow.
[326:11.42]As the remaining subs come through.
[326:16.84]We also had, right at the end, MooMeansMoo gave a dollar.
[326:19.26]Glad I was able to be part of this epic stream.
[326:21.77]Delete that.
[326:22.33]It was quite a win.
[326:23.79]Anyway, gotta go back to looking at those LOL cat memes.
[326:27.21]They're hilarious.
[326:27.99]I sure hope he gets his cheeseburger someday.
[326:30.67]Check out his hilarious site called Shoes if you get a chance.
[326:34.47]Much love, buddy.
[326:35.11]Have a good night.
[326:37.55]Uh, Platu- PlatuDunius, thanks for the $5.25 at the very end.
[326:41.32]I got kicked from the last game of MSM when someone else joined, but it was worth it knowing that we got to see Zombie betray the chat.
[326:51.55]Sorry that I had to kind of detonate the room a couple of times, but thank you so much.
[326:59.86]And right at the very end, MooBeansMoo, real talk, watching your channel grow has been truly awesome.
[327:03.97]Few other people on the site deserve it more than you.
[327:06.15]You work crazy hard in the stream shows, on the stream of yours, and I've been able to watch through the years.
[327:13.99]It's been amazing.
[327:14.97]So many of your streams feel like an event to look forward to, so on behalf of the community, thank you for all you do.
[327:21.07]Thank you.
[327:24.84]My intention is to try to make each stream as fun and interesting as I can.
[327:32.07]And if it's not, if I feel like it's not, then I feel bad.
[327:37.57]So, just know that that's the goal every time.
[327:41.77]And thank you ExtraCheesy for the two bucks.
[327:43.31]Jerma, you're an epic sauce streamer.
[327:45.27]Thank you very much.
[327:48.26]See you guys tomorrow.
[327:50.60]Have a great rest of your night.
[327:52.82]And goodbye.
[327:54.35]And thank you, Timmy Tim Tim, for the $1.
[327:55.77]Stalling you, leaving like you stall the next mission in L.A.
[327:58.12]Noire.
[327:58.46]There it is.
[327:59.00]Okay, good night.
[327:59.80]Have a good one.
[328:00.24]I'll see you tomorrow.
[328:01.76]Get some sleep.
