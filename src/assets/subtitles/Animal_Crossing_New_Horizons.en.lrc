[ve:61.7.100]

[00:01.32]Hey, I probably should change the title to, uh, instead of 5 plus hours, 2?
[00:09.64]3?
[00:11.20]3 plus?
[00:13.88]2 plus?
[00:16.11]Maybe?
[00:16.39]5 is a lot.
[00:18.05]That's a lot of picking up fruits and vegetables and breaking the leaves.
[00:23.51]Well, good afternoon.
[00:24.57]How are you?
[00:27.51]Welcome to the stream.
[00:29.58]Today, if you didn't know, if you just clicked on the stream and you weren't, you didn't see the tweet, you didn't, you just, here I am.
[00:37.27]We're going to be playing Animal Crossing New, almost said Leaf, New Horizons.
[00:42.35]It's a different, it's new.
[00:44.85]Animal Crossing New Horizons, it's out.
[00:47.36]It's out now on the Nintendo Switch.
[00:51.34]Uh, I played New Leaf on the DS.
[00:53.65]I thought it was fun.
[00:55.55]And I kind of, I mean, we can just chill for a little bit and start our world, right?
[01:02.53]After last night's insanity, I wanted to slow it down a little bit.
[01:07.11]If, for some reason, this game bores the shit out of me in three or four hours, then we'd go back to Fuckface City.
[01:16.14]Wink Dink City is still available for us to continue.
[01:20.70]If, after a few hours, I'm kind of... We'll see.
[01:24.57]I might play this all night.
[01:26.61]I might play it for four hours.
[01:27.79]I might play it for seven hours.
[01:29.01]I have no idea.
[01:32.58]I cannot give you the answer there.
[01:33.72]Spoiler alert, the game is boring.
[01:38.25]Yeah, but sometimes that's what you want.
[01:39.39]Sometimes I just want to rake leaves.
[01:42.21]It's like fish and stuff.
[01:47.17]It's a chores game.
[01:49.07]It fits under the category for me of number one genre.
[01:54.41]You guys all know this by now.
[01:58.70]I'm ready to fucking harvest carrots.
[02:02.89]Why am I always playing chores games?
[02:04.61]Because I don't know, I like them.
[02:09.81]Why do you eat fucking gross ass raisin oat bread?
[02:14.19]No, no, because you like it.
[02:15.39]I don't like it.
[02:15.95]I think like raisin bread is disgusting, but that isn't you.
[02:18.29]You can, you can like raisin bread.
[02:23.75]But I can, I can put my hands up and go, no, thank you.
[02:26.85]I do not want fucking, I don't know.
[02:29.05]I don't want hard, sweet boogers in my bread.
[02:31.81]No, thank you.
[02:35.59]We all are allowed to have things and like things that we like.
[02:41.19]Anyways.
[02:42.68]Let's move on.
[02:44.38]To... Animal Crossing.
[02:50.30]Word on New Horizons.
[02:53.02]Here it comes.
[03:00.95]Here it comes.
[03:03.15]Friends online.
[03:04.67]One.
[03:05.79]Oh, you have one friend online.
[03:09.29]Oh.
[03:10.33]That's good.
[03:10.93]I didn't even know that you could have friends on a Nintendo Switch.
[03:20.42]Don't they not allow that?
[03:26.16]Wait, there's more than one Tom Nook?
[03:28.40]Good afternoon, we're so excited to have you here.
[03:31.34]Have you here.
[03:33.54]There's so much to look forward to, but first!
[03:35.10]Let me introduce myself.
[03:36.13]I'm Tom Nook.
[03:36.61]And I'm Tom Nook, too!
[03:40.35]We'll be flying to the island with you to help you get settled.
[04:02.95]Think of us as your partners, and we're in it for the long haul, so let's get started, shall we?
[04:06.55]Oh, please!
[04:07.25]Oh, come on, alright, I forgot we got some fuckin' Animal Crossing fans in here!
[04:11.50]I should- yeah, be careful what I say!
[04:16.32]Okay, alright, alright!
[04:22.99]Now then, we'll need to look up your application.
[04:24.53]Can we have your name and birthday?
[04:25.75]You don't get- fuckin'... What, are you gonna sell this shit, Nintendo?
[04:32.25]You can't change this.
[04:33.41]This can only be seen- this can be seen by others.
[04:38.13]Uh... You just ruined the game for me.
[04:43.48]It just came out, like, a day ago.
[04:46.18]You'll be alright.
[04:47.54]This is the first 15 seconds.
[04:49.24]Alright, how about, uh... This doesn't even matter.
[04:54.73]Naming the character doesn't even fucking matter.
[04:58.22]Make sure it's super funny.
[04:59.24]You can change it later.
[05:00.86]It says you can't change this in red letters.
[05:03.48]You can't change it.
[05:06.06]How about, uh... Uh... Sweet... Uh... Sweet... Um... Yummy... Uh... Oh... Boo... Boo... This isn't complicated.
[05:25.30]Just use your name.
[05:26.34]Oh.
[05:26.48]Yeah.
[05:26.96]Yeah.
[05:28.69]Right.
[05:30.55]That's what- that's my name.
[05:31.97]That makes a funny noise, hold on.
[05:44.01]Oh.
[05:44.95]Right, it's just my name.
[05:46.03]Uh, okay.
[05:57.45]What's your birthday?
[05:58.29]You cannot change your birthday later.
[05:59.89]People... You cannot change your birthday later.
[06:01.91]People you don't know might see this.
[06:04.25]Oh.
[06:05.35]So... Does it also include the... Almost three or four thousand people that are staring at the screen right now?
[06:14.41]Oh.
[06:15.15]Well.
[06:16.93]I was born on the fucking 4th of July.
[06:32.99]Jeremy, Jeremy, let's see.
[06:34.31]Fourth of July!
[06:36.45]Oh yes, here you are.
[06:40.03]Our next step will be to take a picture of you.
[06:41.87]Wait, there's a camera on this thing?
[06:43.63]Don't worry, take as much time as you need to get yourself looking- Wait, what do you mean there's a camera?
[06:47.31]Is there a camera on here?
[06:49.23]Is there a camera?
[06:50.95]Does the Switch have a camera on it?
[06:54.06]Oh.
[06:57.40]I don't know why, I was like, please choose your style.
[07:01.93]Yeah, you just you make a me you make it you make a me mode, right?
[07:06.33]Okay That's kind of accurate there is that it for hairstyles I
[07:35.69]What kind of eyes do I have?
[07:36.90]Okay, those are kind of my eyes.
[07:55.27]Hmm.
[07:56.22]Hmm.
[07:57.58]Those are kind... No, those are my... Those are kind of my eyes.
[08:00.68]And I have a nice... I have a nice cool slate gray-blue eye.
[08:09.39]Like that.
[08:11.11]No, it's like... It's somewhere between here and here.
[08:20.44]It's like that.
[08:21.02]It's like this one.
[08:22.46]Whatever.
[08:23.48]It's blue.
[08:24.32]Yeah, but I want it to be perfect.
[08:25.60]Hey, you want to make your Animal Crossing character the way you want.
[08:28.32]I'm going to make my Animal Crossing character the way that I want.
[08:32.64]My face is this constantly.
[08:36.38]Yeah, that's pretty accurate.
[08:39.52]What is this?
[08:39.96]Zits?
[08:40.76]Can I put zits?
[08:41.36]Okay, no.
[08:46.59]Alright, that's good.
[08:50.23]Good.
[08:52.95]Does everything look okay?
[08:53.87]It does.
[08:57.30]I'm not that pale.
[09:01.30]Great, you're all set.
[09:02.28]All set.
[09:04.19]I'll just go ahead and add that picture to your records.
[09:07.71]And now, let's start talking about your new home.
[09:11.13]So exciting.
[09:12.05]Exciting.
[09:12.45]For sure.
[09:14.89]You see, we're quite proud of the work we've done to help you feel comfortable in your new life.
[09:18.59]Oh yes, in fact, if you want, you can even experience the seasons the same way you're used to them.
[09:23.36]What I mean is, we have islands in both the northern and southern hemisphere.
[09:30.10]The villagers are going to throw a birthday party for you on July 4th.
[09:33.40]That's alright.
[09:34.12]It's the 4th of July.
[09:34.88]We're going to have a party anyways.
[09:37.35]We recommend choosing an island that has the same seasonal pattern as your current home.
[09:42.19]Current home?
[09:43.11]Why the fuck am I doing that?
[09:44.23]So tell me, Jeremy.
[09:45.69]Where do you live now?
[09:49.57]I live in North America.
[09:51.80]Ah, excellent.
[09:53.20]That information really helps us focus on just the right island for you.
[09:57.06]Naturally, we'd recommend that you relocate to an island in the Northern Hemisphere.
[10:00.26]There are a few more decisions to make, but does that sound okay to you so far?
[10:04.30]So far?
[10:05.38]Oh!
[10:06.33]Okay, if I do that again, I want everyone to leave.
[10:08.87]If I do that again, everyone leave.
[10:12.33]Watch another stream if I do that again.
[10:15.53]Okay, here we go.
[10:19.29]Should I go to Southern Hemisphere?
[10:26.44]No, I want to stay here.
[10:30.10]We have a number of lovely uninhabited islands in the northern hemisphere to choose from.
[10:33.88]Now, then, all of our islands are approximately the same size, and they're all quite natural.
[10:38.37]So don't worry about whether you'll have enough space or comfort.
[10:41.19]You can't go wrong.
[10:42.71]Just follow your instincts and choose an island with a layout that looks appealing.
[10:45.27]That's how I do it.
[10:46.87]Oh, look at how cute this is.
[10:49.14]I'll show you some maps now, and you can choose the best one for your new home.
[11:03.80]Um... Okay, which one do I want?
[11:12.81]The penis one.
[11:15.37]Um... These... Okay, these all could be penises, guys.
[11:20.86]So... I don't know what you're talking about.
[11:25.35]Everything on this screen right now could be a dick.
[11:28.46]So... And some... So you could interpret it somehow.
[11:31.78]So I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[11:32.88]I'm gonna go with the one that there's no way could possibly ever be interpreted as that.
[11:39.96]Which is this one.
[11:40.50]I mean, there is a small... There is a little... There's like a mini... Okay, that's... Okay, I get it.
[11:47.82]Why am I even doing this?
[11:48.66]Alright, I'm gonna do... Oh, what have I done?
[11:51.18]I'm gonna do this one.
[11:57.51]Wonderful choice.
[11:58.53]I can't wait to show it off to you.
[12:02.60]What do you mean, ruined?
[12:03.32]Ah, but before we depart, I have just one final question.
[12:07.52]If you could only bring one thing with you to a deserted island, what would it be?
[12:12.82]Sleeping bag, a lamp, some food.
[12:16.15]Something to... I don't know why, I thought... I didn't read the last word there.
[12:21.19]Something to kill.
[12:22.43]I was like, what?
[12:24.63]Sleeping bag, lamps, food, something to kill.
[12:28.66]Something to kill?
[12:32.52]Okay.
[12:34.48]I'd bring food.
[12:36.65]A bunch of it.
[12:38.23]Oh, they didn't like that answer.
[12:40.91]Oh.
[12:41.77]I'm sorry, that was just a hypothetical question.
[12:46.11]Uh, Nook Inc.
[12:47.13]will fully cover all of your basic needs.
[12:48.67]Yes.
[12:51.78]Wait, they come with me?
[13:14.71]Hello everyone.
[13:16.01]Thank you for taking this chartered flight as part of Nook Inc's deserted island getaway package.
[13:20.10]Please sit back, relax, and enjoy a complimentary video presentation about deserted island life.
[13:28.50]Cutscene?
[13:29.05]Opening cutscene.
[13:33.57]Oh, look it.
[13:34.25]That's our beach.
[13:36.73]Oh wait, no, that's somebody else's beach.
[13:40.74]Oh!
[13:43.75]Oh, I don't want to be here.
[13:44.72]Ah!
[13:45.00]There's bugs everywhere.
[13:49.07]Huge bugs.
[13:51.29]This place sucks.
[13:52.23]I want to go home.
[13:52.73]I don't want to be here.
[14:12.34]Wait, why are we doing, like, the end of the movie breakdown of where all the characters ended up?
[14:18.21]We haven't even started.
[14:20.15]Alright, I can't wait to pick up my first shell.
[14:36.38]I can't wait.
[14:41.96]I can't wait to have a bag full of useless shit that people desperately try to tell me, please get rid of the fucking five clams you have in your backpack, it's a waste of time.
[14:51.24]So what's my- wait, everybody gets different fruit, right?
[14:54.05]What do I get?
[14:55.63]I got peaches!
[14:57.29]I got peaches!
[14:59.21]I- uh, listen, I was gonna go a little louder.
[15:01.05]Is peaches good?
[15:04.48]Everybody gets different fruit, right?
[15:08.60]We're here.
[15:09.04]I'm fucking huge.
[15:11.22]Now, I know you must be incredibly excited to explore your new island home, but I have one small request.
[15:14.75]Would you please join us for a short orientation session?
[15:18.31]Yes.
[15:19.59]Our fearless leader himself will be giving a presentation, so I'd hate for you to miss it.
[15:24.95]Fearless leader.
[15:29.58]We're heading there right now.
[15:30.60]If you'd like to move, follow us.
[15:33.32]Alright, well, if you hear the term, our fearless leader... Uh...
[15:39.99]I might- I might start swimming.
[15:48.94]Oh, this is cool.
[15:50.32]Dude, it's like- look, it's like Mario Galaxy.
[15:52.08]The world, like, moves with you.
[15:53.68]The world spins.
[15:55.24]Give me one of these fucking- give me these!
[16:00.00]How do you pick up something?
[16:00.76]Uh-oh.
[16:07.06]How do you pick up?
[16:08.18]B.
[16:10.31]What?
[16:12.55]I can't pick these up.
[16:13.25]Are they gonna rot?
[16:17.97]Oh.
[16:18.87]Hi.
[16:21.75]Alright, is that everyone?
[16:23.37]Let's see.
[16:23.78]Wait, are these the other two suckers that took the trip?
[16:30.12]Is Phoebe here?
[16:31.12]And how about Flip?
[16:35.54]And there's Jeremy, of course.
[16:37.90]Yeah, great.
[16:39.12]We're all here.
[16:42.42]I'll turn it over to you, Mr. Nook.
[16:44.20]Our three adventurers are ready to get started.
[16:47.44]Alright, so we're, like, on the deserted island.
[16:49.92]This is, uh, these two characters are not main characters.
[16:52.51]It's just, okay, these two, these are the two that are the first to die on the deserted island, right?
[16:57.45]I'm the main character of this story.
[16:59.09]So what happens to these two?
[17:02.00]Yes, yes, very good.
[17:04.28]Let's see how she- I mean, this is brand new introductions.
[17:06.20]We don't know these people.
[17:07.20]This is the- In the movie, these two- This guy gets, like- His head, like, dropped like a rock on him or something, right?
[17:14.35]They're my friends.
[17:15.11]Wait, did I- Did they come with me?
[17:19.43]These people come with me.
[17:20.39]These are my friends?
[17:21.27]They came with- Wait, they got on the plane with me.
[17:25.13]Oh, wait, we didn't all get, like, Smash Bros.
[17:26.92]invitations to be here?
[17:29.92]Oh, okay.
[17:31.38]Let's see, how shall I begin?
[17:34.02]Yes, of course.
[17:34.96]Welcome, Erwin.
[17:35.62]Welcome to your new island.
[17:38.10]They're my friends.
[17:39.76]They're my parents.
[17:43.04]Oh.
[17:44.12]No, what?
[17:45.14]Okay, these are my parents?
[17:47.71]What?
[17:48.37]Okay, let's just play.
[17:50.39]Welcome to your new island.
[17:51.29]My name is Tom Nook, and I'm the founder and president of Nook Inc.
[17:53.69]Yes, yes.
[17:54.91]Today is the first day of your new life on this pristine, lovely island, so congratulations.
[17:59.81]And this is a package deal.
[18:00.89]Hmm.
[18:01.02]Hmm.
[18:02.37]Saw!
[18:34.88]Here you go, Jeremy.
[18:36.16]Your very own tent.
[18:39.70]And a funny hammer.
[18:41.69]Once you find the perfect spot, press X to access your inventory, then select your tent!
[18:46.21]Don't worry.
[18:46.65]You'll get a chance to see what it looks like before making your final decision.
[18:49.13]And you want a little breathing room, so take your time finding a space that works for you.
[18:52.05]Oh, I suppose I probably should set you up with a map, too.
[18:59.21]Once you've put your tent, please find your way back here.
[19:01.29]Use your new map if you need to.
[19:02.97]Well, off you go.
[19:03.67]Hope you find a great spot.
[19:17.63]Fuck, I can't pick up sticks.
[19:19.06]Where do I want my house?
[19:19.86]Oh, shit.
[19:23.48]Alright, where do I, uh... Uh-oh, I gotta... Alright, I'm in direct competition with these motherfuckers.
[19:27.82]Alright, nah, uh...
[19:30.59]I want my house right here.
[19:31.49]This is my house.
[19:32.91]I want it right here.
[19:34.41]Right here.
[19:38.45]Wait.
[19:40.01]Should I do it by, like, the river?
[19:40.89]This is a competition, guys.
[19:46.29]This is, like, yeah, this is Survivor.
[19:48.25]We're gonna do, like, challenges and shit.
[19:51.79]People are gonna get eliminated.
[19:52.73]Maybe right here.
[19:57.30]I kind of like it right on the crest.
[19:59.60]Right here.
[20:00.62]Right where the waterfall is.
[20:01.54]That's perfect.
[20:03.70]Is that too... Is that too basic?
[20:07.64]That's very basic, right?
[20:09.67]How many people... Okay, everyone is streaming this game.
[20:11.75]Literally, literally every fucking human on Twitch is streaming Animal Crossing, like, right now.
[20:17.41]Is this the spot that everybody picked?
[20:23.15]I don't want my house to be in the same spot.
[20:26.16]No.
[20:26.58]Nobody picks this?
[20:27.70]No, this spot is based.
[20:30.37]Okay, I don't really know what that means in this scenario here.
[20:34.07]I'm doing it right here.
[20:40.29]Too close to the water.
[20:41.53]Oh, what about this big rock?
[20:44.01]Does that matter?
[20:44.51]Too close to the water.
[20:56.43]Should I put my tent here?
[20:58.25]Is it... All maps are random, you idiot.
[21:04.91]Uh... Okay, check the box of... Check the box of... I played maybe like two hours of New Leaf, and that's the only time in Animal Crossing I've ever had.
[21:19.26]Center it.
[21:20.06]I'm not gonna center it just to make you angry.
[21:22.36]No, that's gonna fuck me up.
[21:24.98]Um... I need to rethink this.
[21:36.22]Here we go.
[21:39.12]Let me imagine it.
[21:44.69]Oh.
[21:45.51]Oh, it's so beautiful.
[21:46.29]Look at that.
[21:46.61]Look at that photo in the background.
[21:47.97]We'll have to do a little landscaping, but we can make this work.
[21:51.85]Don't build over the rock, please.
[21:53.43]Why?
[21:53.69]This is beautiful.
[21:55.51]What's wrong?
[21:55.89]This is like a fucking picture-perfect place.
[22:03.50]Wait.
[22:03.98]Do it.
[22:04.28]Don't do it.
[22:04.82]Don't do it.
[22:05.34]The rock respawns.
[22:06.84]Rock re- The rock- Oh, I'm gone.
[22:10.23]Perfect.
[22:14.59]I set up my tent.
[22:16.35]That's a big first step.
[22:19.15]Do you sleep on the rock?
[22:21.53]Alright, I did it.
[22:22.53]I got the best fucking place.
[22:25.58]Oh, you're gonna dream of this real estate.
[22:27.78]Look at that.
[22:28.88]Imagine.
[22:29.80]Imagine having that in your backyard.
[22:34.37]What's the competition doing?
[22:37.09]Let me see.
[22:42.05]Oh.
[22:42.57]So you're gonna put your shit in like the weeds next to trees and no water?
[22:46.07]That's not even gonna be prime real estate.
[22:47.45]You know what I'm saying?
[22:48.03]That's not gonna appreciate in value over the next decade.
[22:50.00]Mine will.
[22:51.62]Fucking idiot.
[22:53.86]What about you?
[22:54.28]Where's the monkey?
[22:59.28]Oh, whatever.
[23:03.78]You must have found a suitable spot for your tent.
[23:05.70]Talk to them.
[23:06.86]You're the first one back, so I suppose the others must still be searching for the right location.
[23:10.43]You know, since you've already done some scouting.
[23:12.61]The others may appreciate your assistance.
[23:16.77]Oh.
[23:20.63]You want my help?
[23:22.01]Sure.
[23:28.33]Okay, I know there's only so far I can throw that stick, but I'm liking this.
[23:31.86]I like this person.
[23:58.55]Wait, I can find a spot for you?
[24:03.61]Why don't I just, like, put both their tents right next to each other and, like... The weeds down, all the way down... Then I have the best spot.
[24:18.24]Don't do that!
[24:19.78]Don't do that, please!
[24:22.46]Wait, this game's about positivity?
[24:26.64]Oh, yeah?
[24:29.75]This game is about never-endingly paying back a bank for the house that apparently I couldn't afford.
[24:35.59]It's a positive game?
[24:43.07]I'll- I'll find you a spot.
[24:45.40]Woah, for real?
[24:45.94]You're gonna pick out the perfect spot for me?
[24:47.48]You'd do that for someone you just met?
[24:50.64]You know, you're alright, Jeremy.
[24:52.60]In that case, here you go.
[24:54.14]It's your show now, Sparky.
[24:58.11]This is where I turn around and just javelin throw the flag as fucking far as I can over the horizon.
[25:05.45]Into like the water.
[25:10.75]And I make like a very audible like... So it goes flying.
[25:15.89]I'm gonna wait at the plaza in the meantime, okay?
[25:22.88]Alright, let's... Wait, I could have had a beach house?
[25:28.76]I could have had a beach house.
[25:30.36]Could I build on the... I could have had a beach house?
[25:34.12]Fuck.
[25:35.60]I want to be... Can I replace my... Okay, can I take... You can have my house.
[25:39.04]I want this one.
[25:40.06]I could have had a beach house.
[25:41.90]Oh.
[25:43.80]Oh.
[25:44.26]Fire's remorse.
[25:45.39]No.
[25:46.89]No.
[25:51.87]It's too late.
[25:53.63]Oh, look at how...
[26:02.07]Fuck.
[26:02.31]Okay, I want you to have a beach house.
[26:04.09]Because I want to be able to visit your beach house.
[26:12.63]Yes.
[26:21.03]Cool.
[26:21.83]Oh, that's so cool.
[26:22.51]Alright, the other person is going to have a beach house too.
[26:25.32]Yes.
[26:27.96]Wait, the tide's going to come in.
[26:31.76]The tide comes in and just wipes out- that's- alright, is that possible?
[26:40.65]That's not possible, right?
[26:42.65]No, this is a fucking- this is a kid's game.
[26:44.97]Alright, where's the- where's the monkey?
[26:53.84]Why do they want to have houses in the worst- no, I'm giving- you want beach house.
[26:59.79]Nice to meet you.
[27:00.43]You already set up your tent, eh?
[27:01.97]I'm still trying to find the perfect spot.
[27:03.83]I'll be doing some serious cardio, so it's got to have lots of fresh air.
[27:07.07]I think this spot will do the trick, but I don't know.
[27:09.68]What do you think, Jeremy?
[27:11.40]I'll find you a better spot.
[27:12.34]How about on the beach?
[27:15.90]You'll find me a sweet spot to put this tent?
[27:19.26]Oh, we just met and you're already doing some heavy lifting on our friendship, Jeremy.
[27:22.76]Okay, then.
[27:23.64]Can't wait to see the epic spot you picked for me.
[27:25.30]Excuse me, what did you say, Andy?
[27:29.62]The epic spot.
[27:35.28]If you need me, I'll be over at the plaza visualizing how awesome island life is going to be.
[27:44.29]Alright, you... I want two... They both have a beach house.
[27:51.85]Wait, should I put this guy... Should I put this guy underneath the airport?
[27:54.61]Wait, that's not a good place.
[28:08.67]I don't want to be too far away.
[28:09.69]I don't want to walk that far.
[28:11.13]No.
[28:12.07]Here's my fucking play, guys.
[28:13.19]I'm going to have to talk to these two all the time.
[28:15.81]So why not just put their tents right next to each other?
[28:21.59]I'm going to be coming over here and talking to you and then talking to you and then I can move on with my day.
[28:26.24]I don't want to walk across the entire map to talk to somebody.
[28:31.84]You guys are both going to have beach property.
[28:44.34]This is the laziest thing ever.
[28:47.20]Or is it the most efficient thing ever?
[28:49.14]Look, see?
[29:05.71]Can I make everybody live down here?
[29:16.03]beach property welcome back everyone hope you all just found the right spot to set up your new homes
[29:26.08]Of course you can sleep on it for a while.
[29:27.70]Really get a feel for how it suits you.
[29:29.84]And with that taken care of, we can move on to more serious business.
[29:32.67]Like throwing an island warming party.
[29:34.29]We'll have it right here in the plaza with a roaring campfire.
[29:36.75]Any marshmallows involved?
[29:37.95]Like, this is where you lean in.
[29:39.93]You lean in and, like, move your hand a little bit.
[29:42.33]Like, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch up to your mouth.
[29:45.44]Like, leaning in, like, talking very quietly but loudly.
[29:47.90]And you lean forward and you say, Are there marshmallows involved?
[29:51.04]You know, your finger flat pointing up.
[29:52.34]You know what I'm saying?
[29:54.09]And everyone goes, oh!
[29:54.67]Just need a few supplies.
[29:59.67]Yeah, good.
[30:16.85]I feed off of it.
[30:18.39]Oh, I feed off of that negative energy in chat.
[30:22.31]Ah, you made me ten times fucking stronger.
[30:25.19]Timmy, Phoebe, Tommy, and Flip can set up things in here in the plaza.
[30:30.79]Meanwhile, Jeremy and I will work on gathering firewood.
[30:38.52]This guy's a freak.
[30:41.32]Oh, fuck.
[30:41.78]I gotta, okay.
[30:43.02]I gotta...
[30:44.59]Alright, now I can stop being, like, a fucking weirdo.
[30:46.47]Because, like, this is Animal Crossing.
[30:49.71]This is a game that came out within the last week.
[30:51.96]This is the first time I've played a new game in probably a year.
[30:55.46]This is the first time I've played a game that came out after 2006.
[30:59.36]In probably, like, a year and a half.
[31:01.34]So there are people that are probably just going to be coming looking for Animal Crossing gameplay.
[31:05.88]And, like, I'm fucked up.
[31:07.49]So I'm going to, like, tone it down a little bit from here on out.
[31:14.64]Alright everyone, let's get to it.
[31:16.80]Literally yesterday.
[31:17.88]City Skylines came out in like 2007!
[31:18.98]When did it come out?
[31:20.88]2010?
[31:20.92]Jeremy, would you come see me for a moment?
[31:26.69]What, like I walk up there?
[31:27.47]What are you, like a judge?
[31:32.65]Oh, Jeremy.
[31:34.49]I just wanted to go over what we'll need for the campfire.
[31:37.81]I think roughly 10 tree branches should do the trick and find them scattered about the island.
[31:44.58]When you find one lying on the ground, press Y to pick it up.
[31:46.80]Meanwhile, I'll investigate the peach-like items growing in the trees.
[31:50.90]I suspect they're real peaches.
[31:54.12]How did you get to the top?
[31:57.25]Oh.
[32:04.31]Any tree branches you find on the ground or shake out of the trees will work just fine.
[32:07.47]I'm on it.
[32:14.96]Yep.
[32:16.34]I just want to make sure I have these.
[32:19.38]First quest.
[32:20.32]Free branch.
[32:21.40]Got it.
[32:22.08]One.
[32:24.31]Two.
[32:26.63]Three.
[32:28.67]Four.
[32:31.43]Five.
[32:33.69]Rock.
[32:34.46]Give it to me.
[32:39.50]Take the trees.
[32:45.98]Wow.
[32:47.12]Six.
[32:48.24]Seven.
[32:49.54]Eight.
[32:51.68]Nine.
[32:53.66]Ten.
[32:54.30]Done.
[32:54.48]Did I get any?
[33:00.11]Should I collect the peaches and stuff?
[33:01.73]Or no?
[33:07.29]I got him.
[33:08.43]Welcome back.
[33:08.89]I trust you had some success foraging for tree branches.
[33:11.91]Very well.
[33:12.31]Allow me to lighten your load.
[33:16.27]Yes, that should be plenty for our campfire.
[33:18.19]You made quick work of that.
[33:19.55]I'm quite glad that I'll be sharing this desolate island with such a hard worker.
[33:22.55]Ho ho!
[33:23.47]Thinking of surviving on a desolate island, our next task is to round up something to snack on.
[33:29.73]While you were collecting branches, I was evaluating the fruit that seems to be abundant here.
[33:32.63]They look like peaches, they smell like peaches, and they even taste like peaches.
[33:36.19]In fact, they are 100% without a doubt genuine peaches.
[33:40.07]So will you collect six of them for me?
[33:43.55]Mmm.
[33:44.25]You see a tree growing peaches.
[33:45.71]You can press A to shake it and then pick up the fruit.
[33:48.13]We'll have plenty of peaches for us in no time.
[33:50.42]We're gonna sit at a campfire and eat peaches.
[33:52.26]This is such a great Saturday morning children's cartoon.
[33:57.22]I can't wait.
[34:04.70]That is the perfect quest for... Wait, what?
[34:10.51]Oh.
[34:15.91]Wait, that's six.
[34:17.63]Seven, eight, nine.
[34:20.59]Bug.
[34:25.83]Why are people saying 34?
[34:27.69]34.
[34:29.25]That's how old I am.
[34:34.85]That's cute.
[34:36.77]That's fun.
[34:37.31]Yeah, I can be 30.
[34:41.19]I can be 34 and enjoy a game about eating marshmallows around a campfire.
[34:45.69]Well, I knew you were right for the job.
[34:49.19]Thank you once again.
[34:50.31]I'll go ahead and take those peaches off your hands and get started on the preparations.
[34:57.28]Ew, he's 34.
[34:57.70]Hey.
[34:58.18]Relax.
[35:03.94]Time for the campfire.
[35:04.58]Now, is that everything?
[35:06.06]Yes, I believe it is.
[35:06.96]Let's get started with the festivities.
[35:09.95]Is there like a dance button?
[35:12.31]This is a huge fire.
[35:13.51]What the fuck?
[35:16.71]This is like Burning Man.
[35:18.09]Why is this so huge?
[35:19.25]Okay.
[35:19.58]Now please, if you would, pass this chalice around.
[35:21.86]And drink from the blood!
[35:22.82]And it's like, yeah, we're passing around a fucking blood chalice.
[35:48.79]And perhaps my skills as an outdoorsman, hmm.
[35:52.45]Now we may not have the kind of numbers that I originally envisioned.
[35:56.15]That just means we'll have to rise to the challenge.
[36:00.07]And I have no doubt that with hard work and perseverance, we'll shape this deserted island into... I suppose we can't call this a deserted island anymore.
[36:08.38]Hmm, what should we call it?
[36:10.32]What if this rang the back of his head?
[36:18.46]That was weird.
[36:19.46]I sense a great opportunity.
[36:21.68]As the first residents of this island, we should be the ones to name it.
[36:23.88]And in the spirit of democracy, we should put it to a vote.
[36:27.84]Majority rules.
[36:30.28]I told you this is my competition.
[36:31.68]You guys didn't say so.
[36:34.18]Present your ideas.
[36:36.56]Just a name for the island.
[36:40.56]How about... It's an island...
[36:49.02]Like basking.
[36:53.29]I'm not gonna name it Wink Dink Island.
[36:54.95]How about, um... Sea Salty... Salt... Salted... Salted Crest.
[37:08.00]Crested Salt.
[37:09.66]Salted Crest Island.
[37:11.32]I like that.
[37:11.76]Salted Crest Island.
[37:13.54]Salted Crest Island.
[37:21.77]Salted Crest.
[37:27.50]What?
[37:31.98]Salted... Salted C-T?
[37:35.74]No, Salted Crest.
[37:42.22]You know, I'm getting real sick and fucking tired of video games doing this shit.
[37:46.66]If you have a character limit, do not, under any circumstances, have extra hangman spaces after the fucking limit is there.
[37:58.13]Every game does this shit.
[38:09.19]Um... Crested...
[38:13.99]I want- I like the crested part.
[38:16.28]Crested... Crested, uh... Crested crust.
[38:23.50]Crested salt.
[38:25.50]Can I do crested salt?
[38:27.73]Crested salt.
[38:29.91]Crested salt.
[38:33.85]Crested salt.
[38:35.29]Crested sa- ah!
[38:40.16]Salt crest.
[38:42.10]Done.
[38:44.49]Salt Crest Island.
[38:54.59]Oh, it's perfect.
[38:55.39]Salt Crest Island.
[39:01.49]It has to be all one word?
[39:02.91]Why?
[39:03.21]No, it doesn't.
[39:07.81]Are you okay with Salt Crest?
[39:09.51]The world of Animal Crossing is welcoming to all, so don't include personal info.
[39:15.53]Oh, okay.
[39:16.86]Don't include personal info.
[39:19.14]Are, like, kids putting in their home address here?
[39:25.54]That's, like, gotta be bad, right?
[39:28.36]Are you okay with Saltcrest?
[39:30.00]Yes.
[39:32.07]What's wrong with Saltcrest?
[39:33.33]It's nice.
[39:34.07]It's got a nice ring to it.
[39:38.81]It's an ugly name.
[39:39.87]Saltcrest.
[39:43.95]Make it one word.
[39:45.19]Why?
[39:46.09]It's Saltcrest.
[39:48.64]It has no flavor.
[39:49.82]It doesn't... No!
[39:50.40]It doesn't matter!
[39:51.60]Look at... Alright, is everyone ready?
[39:56.98]Let's try saying our ideas at the same time.
[39:59.70]Ready, go!
[40:01.98]Roxolot.
[40:02.90]Isle de Biceps.
[40:03.94]Saltcrest.
[40:04.28]I actually like the one on the right.
[40:06.44]Actually, I like Isle de Biceps.
[40:10.01]Can I vote for that guy?
[40:15.06]Clap for the one you think is the best.
[40:17.34]Jeremy seems to have the enthusiasm and the naming sensibilities.
[40:20.25]Let's start there.
[40:21.27]So Jeremy suggested Salt Crest.
[40:27.27]Yeah!
[40:29.79]Wow, that's an overwhelmingly positive response.
[40:32.92]Wait, how come the little monkey guy got more spaces than me?
[40:41.50]You just go with Saltcrest.
[40:48.20]And from now, this island will be known as Saltcrest.
[40:50.72]Well, Jeremy, since you've proven yourself by naming Saltcrest, I'd like to rely on you for other critical decisions we'll need to make on the island.
[40:58.04]Yes, I hereby name you the resident representative of Saltcrest.
[41:08.02]Wait.
[41:09.64]Yes, Jeremy, your hand's in the air.
[41:11.79]Why is your hand up?
[41:13.81]I just... There's a salt water around us, right?
[41:17.79]There's no fresh water.
[41:20.09]Otherwise, we're going to have to go with the fucking bicep one.
[41:23.55]And we're surrounded by salt water, right?
[41:28.73]Where are we?
[41:48.39]Oh, it's so easy.
[41:50.31]It's so easy.
[41:52.05]Howdy!
[41:52.55]A word or two.
[41:53.45]You can count on me.
[41:55.01]I'll be the new spokesperson.
[42:02.68]He acts like it was intentional.
[42:05.88]Okay.
[42:10.66]I'm a fucking mystery!
[42:12.38]We've settled on a name for our island and we've settled on our resident representative.
[42:15.52]It's been a big day, but it's gotten rather late.
[42:17.89]Let's have a toast.
[42:22.29]Everyone have a beverage at hand?
[42:24.41]It's fresh juice made from peaches.
[42:27.41]Our new resident representative harvested on this very island.
[42:31.95]And without further ado, a toast to Saltcrest and the happiness of its residents.
[42:35.85]Cheers!
[42:43.55]Why poop cocktail?
[42:44.97]What the fuck?
[42:47.05]Alright, that was fun!
[42:48.39]Now that's all I can do in Animal Crossing till I wake up tomorrow morning.
[42:51.44]Cool!
[42:52.48]That was fun.
[42:57.02]I don't know how you can play an instrument.
[42:58.28]I feel like I'm on vacation, but we actually get to live here.
[43:02.55]Rerack.
[43:09.08]We all just met, but chillin' by the fire like this makes me feel like we've been best buds for ages, Sparky.
[43:17.13]I like to sit down.
[43:23.42]What am I doing?
[43:23.92]Oh, there we go.
[43:28.54]Ah!
[43:37.55]That was fun.
[43:39.15]Different music?
[43:48.17]Oh, I can't put things here?
[43:50.48]Alright, so... Alright.
[43:52.60]Hi Jeremy, having a good time?
[43:55.98]This is all a bit much, but if you like taking a short nap in your tent, by all means, go ahead.
[43:59.82]Keep the fire going.
[44:02.28]I'm not tired yet.
[44:06.25]Enjoy the moment.
[44:06.89]Alright, that spam is fucking stupid.
[44:17.36]I'm not even gonna give it the fucking... Not even gonna read it out loud.
[44:20.52]Alright, what about these boxes?
[44:26.97]Can I just start picking stuff up?
[44:29.15]I mean, isn't there like something you can only do at night in Animal Crossing?
[44:39.54]Yeah, that's fucking fucking funny.
[44:43.58]And I'm the guy with the minus twos.
[44:45.36]I'm the one piling up the minus twos.
[44:48.57]Oh yeah?
[44:57.65]I'm just gonna go to bed.
[45:01.02]When do I get my shovel?
[45:12.92]Do I have any mail?
[45:14.79]Oh, no new mail.
[45:15.69]Fuck.
[45:16.63]What does the inside of my house look like?
[45:19.17]I should probably chat with Tom Nook before I turn in.
[45:21.97]Why do I need Tom Nook's permission to go to sleep?
[45:24.27]What?
[45:26.07]Did he just tell me to do that?
[45:31.58]Oh, you have a flag in your hand.
[45:34.64]Saltcrest!
[45:35.32]Saltcrest!
[45:36.72]What a great name.
[45:37.32]Just rolls off the tongue.
[45:38.79]Thank you for offering such a wonderful idea to the group.
[45:45.31]Ah, Jeremy, having a good time?
[45:46.47]I know so.
[45:47.81]Yeah, so take a short nap in your tent.
[45:49.66]Go ahead.
[45:50.20]We'll keep the fire burning.
[45:51.48]I'm gonna go to take a nap.
[45:53.44]You'll probably want this.
[45:54.62]Bleak.
[45:58.24]It's your very own camping pot.
[46:00.06]You'll want to set it up in your tent before you lie down.
[46:02.16]There are a few packages waiting for you in your tent as well.
[46:05.57]Just a few items that might be useful.
[46:06.87]Okay.
[46:07.21]First aid.
[46:10.65]We've got another big day tomorrow, so rest up.
[46:16.01]That's all from me, sweet dream.
[46:17.61]Cool.
[46:18.53]Alright, let's go.
[46:23.09]Wait, you got electricity in there?
[46:24.33]Where are you going?
[46:26.37]What's in there?
[46:27.76]Excuse me, we're setting up a resident services facility in there, but it's not ready for you just yet.
[46:31.56]Please give us a little more time.
[46:34.92]You got fucking lights in there, man.
[46:40.39]Do I have a lamp?
[46:49.85]What's he hiding?
[46:50.57]I don't know.
[46:56.71]Oh, a radio!
[47:04.04]It's a fucking Silent Hill.
[47:07.70]Turn it off!
[47:08.22]I don't want to hear this.
[47:11.26]Turn it off!
[47:13.14]That was scary.
[47:15.00]What's this?
[47:16.34]Oh, a lamp.
[47:17.91]Alright, I want the lamp in the corner.
[47:19.07]Okay, I want this in the other corner.
[47:33.26]Actually, this could go right over here.
[47:39.70]Do I need to use the cot?
[47:42.26]Or can I lie flat on my back staring at the ceiling?
[47:51.00]Put it down.
[47:52.40]See?
[47:53.04]That's good.
[47:53.48]Can I put... I mean, I'm not sure about the design here, but... Look, it's comfortable.
[48:02.41]Alright, let's go to bed.
[48:07.71]Rest my head for a little while.
[48:08.91]Yes.
[48:09.93]Yes.
[48:11.79]I'm getting sleepy.
[48:29.30]Oh, there he is!
[48:29.80]There's, uh, there's, what's his name?
[48:32.14]Kwee Kwa?
[48:32.84]His name's Kwee Kwa?
[48:33.60]Oh, KK.
[48:34.26]KK Slider, right.
[48:38.81]So, looks like you've decided to make your own way in the world.
[48:40.81]Get out there, explore new frontiers.
[48:43.87]That's all the way, right?
[48:46.05]Daddy-o, you don't need to live by anyone's rules but your own.
[48:48.71]The world is made for exploring, you know?
[48:52.98]Living free, being out there is a great feeling.
[48:57.19]Yeah, I don't know.
[49:01.23]Yeah, but take it from a cat who's been on the road, being by your lonesome can grind on the soul.
[49:05.92]You gotta make friends along the way.
[49:08.26]Rambling this crazy world is squaresville without some pals.
[49:11.78]Yeah, man, friends are where it's at.
[49:13.79]Speaking of rambling, I'm doing a bit of that myself.
[49:16.53]My bad.
[49:17.15]Maybe it's about time for you to wake up to your new life.
[49:21.75]But listen up.
[49:22.75]That rap I just gave you about friends?
[49:24.67]Pretty key.
[49:25.91]You'll dig this island life a whole lot more if you share it with some friends, if that's your scene.
[49:29.63]I don't have any friends.
[49:31.23]An island Paradise with your best pal sounds pretty groovy to me.
[49:33.55]Cool.
[49:34.79]When you wake up, you'll be in sync with real time.
[49:38.60]Dig that island life and catch you later.
[49:40.20]We're in real time now.
[49:54.00]Jeremy!
[49:54.88]Are you in there?
[49:55.70]Oh, I hope I haven't woken you abruptly.
[49:57.50]Ah, but I do wish to discuss something with you.
[49:58.92]Yes!
[49:59.18]I'll be here when you're ready.
[50:00.43]Oh.
[50:09.00]Save electricity.
[50:21.93]Ah, there you are.
[50:22.41]Hope you had a pleasant nap.
[50:25.67]Oh, well, I suppose it was a bit more than a nap, wasn't it?
[50:27.35]It's fucking bright out.
[50:28.61]It's a brand new day.
[50:29.45]Uh, I needed that.
[50:34.62]Oh, yes, it's quite normal to be worn out from such a long trip and a major life event.
[50:38.98]Speaking of which, I have a few more things that you might find useful as you adjust to life in our little Paradise.
[50:44.54]First, you need one of these.
[50:48.23]Oh wait, they added iPhones?
[50:53.26]You knew it was coming eventually.
[50:55.90]You knew it was coming eventually.
[50:58.98]It's your own Nook phone.
[51:01.02]I had these made especially for island residents.
[51:05.34]I want to make sure it's working, right?
[51:06.90]So could you try turning it on for me?
[51:08.38]Yeah.
[51:13.73]Welcome.
[51:19.09]Tracking.
[51:20.51]Good, good.
[51:21.33]Looks like you're getting good reception as well.
[51:23.29]Feel free to put it away.
[51:24.43]Hey Jeremy, have you ever used a smartphone before?
[51:29.25]Um... I... I don't... I've never done... I don't know what that is, sonny.
[51:38.52]Is that so?
[51:39.28]How wonderful of you, I dare say, do you seem especially well suited for life on this rustic island.
[51:44.06]Nevertheless, I believe you'll find this nook phone quite handy, so do take the time to learn how to use it.
[51:48.83]I have one more thing for you.
[51:49.85]It's a deed to the house.
[51:54.19]It's your itemized bill.
[51:56.49]This includes everything.
[51:57.21]Airfare, accommodations, labor tax, and of course, your Nook phone.
[52:00.93]Hmm.
[52:01.63]Bringing your grand total to the modest sum of $49,800.
[52:03.79]Okay.
[52:04.13]Yes, well then... Wait!
[52:11.77]They don't have any bells!
[52:12.87]I can't believe I didn't think of this.
[52:16.40]Of course.
[52:16.86]Well, no need to worry.
[52:20.16]I was prepared for exactly this type of tricky situation.
[52:23.66]For the getaway package, you can pay your fees with miles instead of the standard bells.
[52:29.89]I call this extremely helpful service the Nook Mileage Program.
[52:36.51]What the fuck are you talking about?
[52:38.81]It's quite extraordinary if I do say so myself.
[52:40.51]For the Nook Mileage Program, you can earn miles by simply living your life here on Saltcrest.
[52:47.06]I dare say the more you enjoy your island life, the more Nook Miles you can earn.
[52:50.40]And you can use them to pay back your move-in fees, and much more.
[52:54.63]The bottom line is you'd need 49,800 bells to pay your move-in fees, but with this new service, would you believe it, it only comes to 5,000 miles.
[53:05.84]Let's go ahead and register you so you can pay in miles.
[53:10.00]Yes, yes, but there are more details available with your Nook phone.
[53:12.48]Just open the Nook Miles app.
[53:14.00]And you see that you've earned some miles just for traveling to the island and joining the program.
[53:20.01]Holy shit.
[53:20.89]Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to a few other matters, but let me heartily congratulate you once again on your arrival.
[53:25.63]So happy to have you as a resident of Salt Crest and a client of Nook Incorporated.
[53:32.74]Fucking miles.
[53:37.95]My new life is underway.
[53:38.99]I can do whatever I want.
[53:40.33]Woohoo, let's go.
[53:41.17]From now on, island time will match the flow of time in the real world.
[53:46.53]Do not touch the power button when you see the autosave indicator in the top right screen.
[53:50.33]You can also save and quit your game by pressing the minus button.
[53:56.05]4.45 p.m.
[53:57.51]March 21st, Saturday.
[53:59.17]Here's the phone.
[54:01.27]Camera.
[54:01.71]Take pictures using various filters and effects.
[54:04.43]What?
[54:05.55]Pictures will be saved to the album on the home menu and other users who use the same system will be able to see them.
[54:10.66]Okay.
[54:13.92]Wait, how do I take a better picture than this?
[54:49.13]Oh, wait.
[54:54.27]Yeah, that's my house.
[55:02.60]That sucked!
[55:03.74]Do it again.
[55:06.34]Why are they so bad?
[55:18.53]Why are they so out of focus?
[55:19.51]Okay.
[55:40.34]It's an emulator glitch.
[55:56.60]This is just what you do when you buy a new camera.
[55:59.43]You're just like, I love this thing!
[56:00.75]And you take like a thousand stupid fucking pictures.
[56:02.95]Okay, I'm done.
[56:09.46]Is that my low on battery?
[56:10.52]Here's the miles.
[56:14.58]You're enrolled in the Nook mileage program.
[56:17.71]Ooh.
[56:17.95]Ooh.
[56:47.96]Let me get him.
[56:50.08]You got 500 miles.
[56:54.85]Uh... Learning how to fish is an essential skill for living on a remote island, hmm?
[56:59.63]Nook Inc.
[57:00.07]encourages all island residents who are aiming to become... Yes!
[57:04.61]One of the goals of Nook Inc.
[57:05.65]is resident togetherness.
[57:07.63]Our Gregarious Greetings initiative aims to reward you with Nook Miles just for chatting with residents.
[57:13.39]Try to talk to all your neighbors every day.
[57:16.80]Okay, earn miles just for catching creepy crawlies.
[57:19.92]Every bug you catch is one that won't be surprising someone in their sock drawer.
[57:25.80]Planting flowers makes our island beautiful.
[57:28.06]Cool.
[57:29.24]You'll get nook miles based on the amount of fruit you've sold.
[57:31.20]Remember, if you sell our island's specialty fruits on other islands, you might be able to get better prices.
[57:35.90]And go ahead and be selfish.
[57:38.50]Okay, there's like a thousand of these.
[57:41.72]Wait.
[57:44.57]You took your first island photo.
[57:52.69]Do I have any more?
[57:53.31]Ooh.
[57:54.25]Edit credit.
[57:56.17]Your passport has some information you can edit.
[57:58.05]Nook Inc.
[57:58.49]will give Nook Miles to folks who customize their profiles.
[58:01.13]Take it slow.
[58:01.63]Think about it and make your own.
[58:02.51]Oh.
[58:07.38]Okay.
[58:09.04]Custom designs.
[58:10.88]With this app, you can create custom designs to wear on clothing or display around the island.
[58:15.10]When you save custom designs to the app, you can share them with other residents.
[58:19.23]There's a chance that your custom designs will be seen by other players during network play, but when you visit it, whatever.
[58:24.25]Please don't create anything that infringes on others' rights.
[58:27.06]Don't use private information or offensive words or images.
[58:35.02]Design, display, change design.
[58:40.74]What?! !
[59:39.47]Um, okay.
[59:48.42]Wait, why is this the thing in the middle?
[59:54.76]Wait, it's if you can make it face paint?
[59:56.92]Hold on a second.
[60:02.51]What?
[60:02.81]It can be, why can it be face paint?
[60:15.77]Okay, well that's... Interesting.
[60:20.99]No, you know what?
[60:22.31]I look like I'm about to go... I look like I'm about to go to like a 49ers game.
[60:36.38]Where's my points?
[60:37.40]There we go.
[60:43.87]San Francisco clowns.
[60:48.16]Dude, can you guys... Do you have any idea just how fucking popular and how insane it would be?
[60:54.78]Everybody would eat it up.
[60:56.02]It would be the most popular fucking team.
[60:57.52]It would have so many fans.
[60:59.95]If they were like the Cincinnati clowns and their uniforms were just clown fucking colored and they had clown hair and shit, I would be the biggest fucking fan ever.
[61:15.06]Why are you guys spamming this link?
[61:18.18]Alright, alright, I got it, I got it.
[61:20.22]What the fuck is that?
[61:25.28]What the hell is this?
[61:29.60]Why is there a giant, weird, like, Satan QR code?
[61:35.97]Scan it?
[61:38.37]Wait, I can scan- how do I scan that?
[61:50.31]With the phone app?
[61:55.37]Hold on.
[61:55.91]Map.
[61:57.01]You have to upgrade the app first.
[61:59.95]Alright.
[62:01.81]How did you get that?
[62:05.38]Check the map for your current location.
[62:09.04]You can also press X to change the settings and choose whether to display the minimap during your day-to-day activities.
[62:12.94]Cool.
[62:14.66]Oh, look.
[62:17.52]And on your IRL phone.
[62:20.84]Oh.
[62:21.70]So wait, I have to download the Nintendo app and log in and sync it and shit?
[62:31.78]Your passport information is shown here.
[62:33.18]This information may be seen by other players when visiting another island, for example, okay?
[62:39.42]You can change your photo, title, or comment at any time.
[62:42.88]Customize, whatever.
[62:55.30]That's fine.
[62:56.50]Wait, take photo.
[63:03.62]I don't care.
[63:04.16]Okay.
[63:05.08]No!
[63:30.19]Are there more of these?
[63:37.09]How many more of these exist?
[63:43.31]Oh, it's a fireman.
[63:44.63]Dude, should I do the face paint to that face?
[63:48.33]Alright, how long is it gonna- I don't even know what my- Guys, I'm gonna be honest, I don't even know what my Nintendo account is.
[64:07.21]Do it manually.
[64:08.09]Do it, what, like... Hold on, I want to go in here.
[64:14.65]Who's got that Fireman QR code?
[64:17.66]Hi, Jeremy, welcome, welcome.
[64:19.18]I can see it's quite cozy in here.
[64:20.48]It's funny how cozy doesn't always mean comfortable, hmm?
[64:23.68]Let me know if you need advice on how to spend your time on the island, or anything else.
[64:28.78]If you need some advice about basic island materials, you should talk to Timmy.
[64:33.27]Not strictly advisable from a business perspective, but quite generous.
[64:35.85]Yes.
[64:35.95]Hmm?
[64:54.70]Alright, yeah, I got peaches for you.
[64:57.02]Welcome, welcome.
[64:57.80]You don't waste any time, do you?
[64:58.84]We're still setting up, but for starters, we intend to offer a small selection of goods.
[65:03.30]Space is limited right now, but we'll try to have some fresh stock each and every day.
[65:06.40]I'm sure you're busy, but feel free to take a look at some of the items we're thinking of selling.
[65:10.46]I'll take a look.

[66:14.02]Nice.
[66:14.62]Uh, I still gotta tell you something about the fruit.
[66:18.00]When you eat food like fruit, you'll find yourself energized with more power than you might have possibly imagined.
[66:24.01]Has anyone shared that with you?
[66:25.91]What I mean is you could break open rocks or maybe even dig up a whole tree if you had the right tool.
[66:29.99]Now, it's fine for you to sell me your fruit, but you should try eating it once in a while.
[66:34.87]Alright, well, I have some other stuff for you.

[70:55.08]That was perfect.
[70:56.18]As you can see, crafting is quite simple, provided you have the correct recipe.
[71:00.60]That concludes my free DIY workshop.
[71:02.52]There's one last thing.
[71:05.50]I have a few common DIY recipes for you, free of charge, naturally.
[71:08.66]I'll just need to send them to your Nook phone.
[71:11.79]Would you mind opening it up?
[71:20.93]Ooh, DIY recipes.
[71:26.88]Ready for you to use the DIY app.
[71:29.94]And the flimsy fishing rod you just crafted is yours to keep.
[71:31.92]It may not last forever, but it should serve you well for a little while at least.
[71:35.98]Speaking of fishing, I'm no master angler, but perhaps I can give you a few tips.
[71:41.14]Aim in the front shadow.
[71:43.72]You should aim in front of the shadow of a fish when you cast your line.
[71:47.16]Yes.
[71:48.16]I'd love to see anything you can manage to catch.
[71:49.86]I'm quite curious about the local fauna.
[71:54.31]Alright, let's take a look at our fucking app.
[72:03.03]Whatever, I don't even... I don't need to make it now.
[72:11.20]Pain in the ass.
[72:15.86]I gotta get my miles!
[72:16.68]Alright, I didn't make five?
[72:18.66]Have a nice DIY, okay.
[72:22.77]A lot of stuff to do.
[72:23.45]Alright, I got my tools.
[72:25.65]I'm ready.
[72:26.95]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[72:34.64]He's addicted to his phone.
[72:36.48]How do you pause the game?
[72:37.58]Oh, you can't.
[72:38.18]I'll just fucking look at my phone.
[72:40.14]That's like pausing in real life anyways.
[72:41.76]I'll be right back.
[74:23.23]Thank you.
[75:25.45]You know how cow has like four stomachs?
[75:29.30]Sometimes I'm convinced that I have four or five bladders.
[75:32.64]And they just all fill up over the course of like a week.
[75:36.70]And then I just pee like a full three minute piss.
[75:43.97]Back to it.
[75:47.49]Alright, let me... 5.07 p.m.
[75:52.01]What the fuck have I been doing?
[75:55.34]Wait, eat?
[75:56.56]Eat and then hit the rock with my head or something, right?
[75:58.54]Oh, I don't have anything.
[76:00.84]Oh wait, fishing rod!
[76:02.60]Wait, watering can.
[76:03.66]Wait, give me the net.
[76:04.76]Hold it.
[76:07.39]How do I use it?
[76:08.97]Okay, I'm gonna go get a butterfly.
[76:19.41]What is it?
[76:21.23]Whoa!
[76:22.64]I caught a common butterfly.
[76:24.36]That's not very good.
[76:33.24]This one's yellow.
[76:33.80]This one must be rare.
[76:35.82]Yes.
[76:36.66]I caught a yellow butterfly.
[76:37.92]Shouldn't all butterflies be yellow?
[76:40.50]Ah, that's cute.
[76:46.82]Yo, Jeremy.
[76:47.38]I'm getting a real good vibe from the tent plot you picked for me.
[76:49.94]Thanks for the hand.
[76:52.93]You've got to look out for each other.
[76:54.21]Why are you minus... You don't... Minus twoing... I didn't do that.
[77:00.13]Some of you guys really don't understand the concept of -2 and +2.
[77:05.98]And it's you minus twoing me.
[77:08.24]The game made the joke.
[77:09.62]I'm sitting here saying the same damn thing as you.
[77:14.45]What?
[77:14.63]What do you want me to click on?
[77:15.55]Another fucking... Look, I know that there's like 5,000 red bubble scam shit, like shower curtains with my face on it and stuff.
[77:23.93]I know.
[77:25.53]What the fuck?
[77:35.91]I... What?
[77:39.53]That's just not even... That's just not even legal.
[77:44.19]That's illegal!
[77:46.05]Stop!
[77:47.25]Alright.
[77:48.17]I... What do you mean it isn't?
[77:54.37]Oh yeah, that character... That's... That's Creepy Chris!
[77:59.31]And I created him on stream an hour ago!
[78:01.79]That's my intellectual property!
[78:07.00]I was about to think about how to thank you, but I can't find a recipe for a leaf umbrella.
[78:14.27]What do you mean I didn't copyright it?
[78:16.07]Doesn't matter.
[78:16.45]I sat here and said, that's creepy, Chris!
[78:18.55]And I sit here, I created the character.
[78:21.25]It's legal tender at that point.
[78:23.71]It's legal tender.
[78:24.47]Alright, so the first thing... Wait, does it make an umbrella?
[78:30.19]That's a lot of weeds.
[78:32.47]That's kind of where I got the idea.
[78:34.47]That's a DIY project that uses weeds.
[78:37.37]Think about it.
[78:37.93]Weeds are the most abundant natural resource we have.
[78:40.25]May as well use them, Sparky.
[78:44.71]Alright, how many do you want?
[78:49.19]Why are these common french fry boxes?
[79:00.06]How many do I have?
[79:01.06]Let me look at my DIY fucking project list.
[79:09.96]Wait, didn't... Was I not paying attention?
[79:12.19]I was!
[79:13.98]I'm back for more, huh?
[79:15.42]Must be my winning personality, Sparky.
[79:16.98]Oh, I have to learn it.
[79:19.08]Okay.
[79:19.63]You have to learn it.
[79:23.05]You have to learn it.
[79:25.73]Learn it in your inventory.
[79:27.87]Ah!
[79:29.49]Bye, Sparky!
[79:30.33]Okay, it's like a little card you have to learn.
[79:34.94]Huh?
[79:37.44]Okay.
[79:38.76]Sweet, another D.I.R.A.
[79:40.56]Leaf Umbrella.
[79:48.30]And I need 15 clumps of weeds.
[79:50.98]Well, fuck your house.
[79:52.62]I'm going to my house to take care of the weeds.
[79:54.68]You gotta do your own house.
[80:01.42]See, I gotta take care of my own house.
[80:03.26]It's going crazy.
[80:05.31]There we go.
[80:10.55]You got mail.
[80:14.09]From Nintendo.
[80:17.86]Congratulations on your big move.
[80:19.20]We hope you enjoy your new island life.
[80:20.68]To celebrate this fresh start, we'd like to give you a gift that's sure to come in handy.
[80:23.46]From Nintendo.
[80:24.44]Fuck.
[80:30.68]You can't throw it away.
[80:32.08]What's in it?
[80:35.87]Hooray!
[80:38.03]Another one from Nintendo.
[80:40.15]Thank you for downloading the update.
[80:45.36]Okay.
[80:46.14]You get free stuff for downloading updates.
[80:48.70]What is it?
[80:53.43]Simple DIY workbench!
[80:58.83]I learned a DIY- or a simple DIY workbench.
[81:01.01]Okay, what about the other one?
[81:05.17]Open.
[81:06.79]Nintendo Switch.
[81:09.14]Wait, I just- I just got a Nintendo Switch?!
[81:12.04]I won a Nintendo Switch?! !
[81:16.83]Holy shit.
[81:17.91]Hold on.
[81:32.74]What?!
[81:33.98]Wow.
[81:35.80]Can I- Oh, yes.
[81:42.71]I've always wanted one of these things.
[81:47.39]Alright, this is the TV for now.
[81:50.07]You can watch, like, Netflix on this, right?
[81:52.81]There.
[81:56.69]There, that's the TV.
[82:09.27]I have to lie flat on my stomach and put my head down.
[82:22.97]Alright, let's make the umbrella.
[82:29.05]That sounds like fun.
[82:34.63]And... Oh, I need a workbench.
[82:37.27]Oh, wait.
[82:37.75]How do I make the workbench?
[82:44.30]Hardwood and iron nugget.
[82:46.10]Okay.
[82:55.14]Let's make the umbrella.
[82:58.86]Wait, did I just smash his tent?
[83:09.44]Yes.
[83:11.34]Let's craft.
[83:14.14]Pump of weeds, a leaf umbrella.
[83:15.54]Cool.
[83:21.92]Uh, that's all I can do now.
[83:32.12]Should I give this back to Phoebe?
[83:38.24]Phoebe, I have an umbrella for you.
[83:49.83]Phoebe?
[83:50.97]Phoebe?
[83:52.09]Phoebe, you're not... I just came back, what's on your face?
[83:56.59]Um...
[84:09.15]Can you get a lawnmower?
[84:10.07]It's gotta be a lawnmower unlockable, right?
[84:20.25]This place is a fucking mess.
[84:25.24]Why am I doing this?
[84:37.67]Remember, you missed it.
[84:52.61]You missed one, I'm... It's a cleaning game, of course I'm gonna sit here!
[84:58.43]How many do I have?
[84:59.29]Should I sell these?
[85:03.23]Remember why you said you won't stream Luigi's Mansion?
[85:07.05]Oh, shit.
[85:07.59]You're right.
[85:08.77]Yeah.
[85:17.18]I'm an absolute freak show when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[85:21.04]Wait.
[85:21.76]How does this work?
[85:35.49]Get it.
[85:37.27]Get it!
[85:40.25]Go get it!
[85:40.65]Go get it!
[85:50.58]Cap?
[85:50.92]Tepe?
[85:54.48]Yes.
[85:55.48]I caught a black bass.
[85:56.78]The most metal of all fish.
[86:14.26]I have 75 leads!
[86:25.25]What are they, stacks of 100?
[86:37.24]It stacks 100.
[86:37.76]Hey, what can you tell me?
[86:40.14]Oh, Jeremy, it's great to see you.
[86:42.12]That campfire was a lot of fun.
[86:43.26]We're keeping resident services open at night, so feel free to stop by if you need to talk about anything.
[86:48.20]Oh yeah, don't stores close?
[86:49.46]That was my biggest problem with the 3DS one.
[86:53.07]I played New Leaf, and every time I turned it on, I remember it was like always 10, 11, 12 a.m.
[87:03.69]And I could never play the game.
[87:05.43]I would turn it on and be like, ah, time for Animal Crossing.
[87:07.40]I can't play it.
[87:07.90]Everything's closed.
[87:08.80]Oh, well, I'm not playing this now.
[87:13.26]Not this one.
[87:14.02]Okay.
[87:16.36]For the time being, I'll be out and about checking out with everything.
[87:19.12]See how... I don't know what's wrong with my brain.
[87:22.44]A few things.
[87:23.40]If you're ever unsure about what you should do, don't hesitate to stop me for a chat.
[87:30.15]That's what I just did.
[87:31.71]I want to get a couple more fish.
[87:34.25]What else can I craft?
[87:35.03]I'm in a super crafting mood today.
[87:40.17]A campfire.
[87:40.81]A DIY bench.
[87:45.71]Some miles.
[87:47.35]Can I sort these by ones that are available to claim?
[87:52.89]Seller of unwanted stuff.
[88:04.00]First time buyer.
[88:04.74]First custom design.
[88:13.23]Okay.
[88:14.13]2200 miles.
[88:16.83]Cast master?
[88:17.63]Oh, okay.
[88:19.61]Get 10 fish.
[88:21.01]That's the quest I'm doing right now.
[88:33.72]Wait, seashell!
[88:37.36]In a row, no failures.
[88:38.66]That's easy.
[88:40.26]Without missing.
[88:40.94]That's easy.
[88:41.58]What are you doing?
[89:08.45]Fish are all asleep?
[89:09.75]No, they're not.
[89:15.71]Giant bird!
[89:16.55]MonkaS!
[89:17.86]What the fuck is that back there?
[89:19.36]Alright, that does look like Phoebe is like 600 feet tall.
[89:29.92]Giant bird.
[89:33.75]Come here!
[89:50.93]Right in front of you.
[89:51.85]Get it!
[89:52.11]Awww!
[90:01.69]Phoebe unit.
[90:05.55]Hello?
[90:05.87]Anybody in here?
[90:08.21]Looks like no one's here.
[90:09.05]Phoebe.
[90:15.83]Are you here?
[90:16.17]Looks like no one's here.
[90:21.10]Gotta wait for the bite, Jeremy.
[90:23.00]I know.
[90:23.62]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[90:25.28]I gotta find a place where there's a lot of fish.
[90:40.10]Wait!
[90:40.39]Fuck.
[90:47.61]Come here.
[90:50.33]Yellow butterfly.
[90:53.37]Shouldn't all butterflies be yellow?
[90:54.79]Dammit.
[91:02.56]Ah, I got the net wet.
[91:25.69]Wait, what is going on with it?
[91:26.89]Like, spam bots in here?
[91:31.94]I literally can't even see what they're writing.
[91:33.98]Good job, mods.
[91:35.78]You're doing great work.
[91:57.41]Ah, throw it in sub-only.
[91:59.01]Sub-only, sub-only.
[92:00.79]Sub-only, sub-only, sub-only.
[92:05.31]Wait, what is it?
[92:05.99]What?
[92:06.23]I thought you were gonna give it attention.
[92:08.96]Oh, hi guys.
[92:33.16]This is such a fun bug collecting and weed pulling game.
[92:44.81]Wait!
[92:45.97]That's like a monarch butterfly, isn't it?
[92:47.65]Let me get it.
[92:49.69]That's a huge one.
[92:55.53]Come on, fly over here.
[92:58.65]That thing is gigantic.
[93:00.74]Shit, can I even... I can't even get over there, can I?
[93:09.50]No, I don't have a bridge.
[93:10.34]Here we go.
[93:15.32]Ah!
[93:17.86]Fly over here!
[93:18.50]Right into my trajectory, please.
[93:23.34]What?
[93:24.78]Okay, got it.
[93:27.20]Yes.
[93:28.14]I caught a tiger butterfly.
[93:29.52]I've earned my stripes.
[93:32.18]The bridges cost 200,000 bells.
[93:34.50]Well, that's a fucking ton.
[93:45.93]Alright, I'm gonna start, uh, I'm gonna sell the weeds.
[93:47.63]I can get a pole vault?
[93:54.13]That's funny.
[94:04.72]Tax everyone.
[94:05.86]I'm not in charge of the taxes.
[94:10.18]Shit.
[94:11.60]Okay, go on.
[94:13.74]You missed a peach?
[94:14.54]I'll go get it.
[94:20.87]So do you sell these?
[94:21.73]What do you do with these animals?
[94:29.04]Oh, I can't carry anything else.
[94:30.36]Swap it.
[94:32.20]Swap it with... Oh, um... A common butterfly.
[94:39.92]I mean, or at least a common butterfly.
[94:44.21]Alright, I'm gonna go sell all this stuff.
[94:46.35]White peach.
[94:56.28]Ruined?
[94:56.76]How?
[95:01.84]Those ones are rare?
[95:07.52]Are they?
[95:08.36]Hello, hello.
[95:09.69]What would you like to talk to me about?
[95:11.63]I'm all ears.
[95:13.09]Um, I found a creature.
[95:19.35]A tiger butterfly.
[95:20.17]Soft-blocked.
[95:26.38]What a catch.
[95:26.78]I do believe this is a tiger butterfly.
[95:28.24]Hmm.
[95:29.28]If this island can support a tiger butterfly, why, who knows what other fantastic creatures we might find living here.
[95:35.56]Here, I have an idea.
[95:36.28]An old friend of mine runs a museum and would love to... I'd love to send it to him for a closer look.
[95:42.76]Would you be okay with that?
[95:43.94]Yeah.
[95:49.91]Oh, that reminds me.
[95:55.99]This is in no way tied to your generous donation just now, but I have a useful app to show you.
[96:08.36]Ooh, it's Critterpedia.
[96:10.56]I sent you the Critterpedia app.
[96:13.24]It's a terrific resource for an aspiring island researcher such as yourself.
[96:17.42]With this one app, you'll get all the important details about the bugs and fish you catch.
[96:21.29]Yes.
[96:23.63]I do hope you'll continue to fill it up with your discoveries and share them with me too.
[96:29.09]I'm sure I'll be able to come up with some kind of additional reward, hmm?
[96:34.72]Cool.
[96:35.70]Alright, now sell them.
[96:37.48]Wait.
[96:39.38]Interpedia.
[96:41.10]Check this out for information on the bugs and fish you caught.
[96:42.82]So this is like evolutions?
[96:48.24]Common.
[96:48.84]Level 1 common butterfly.
[96:50.60]Level 99.
[96:50.75]Whatever that joke is.
[96:54.77]Somebody will make it.
[97:00.22]Do people think that's still funny?
[97:03.16]From the response, it doesn't seem like it.
[97:05.80]Okay.
[97:08.56]Okay.
[97:10.24]I wasn't sure.
[97:11.67]I didn't know if it was still a relevant thing.
[97:13.79]People thought it was funny.
[97:15.45]And it looks like that's not the case anymore.
[97:17.27]Okay.
[97:18.35]Yes, but please, quick, Rickroll him.
[97:20.83]Again.
[97:20.99]Okay.
[97:22.97]Send him the video again.
[97:27.65]You guys just want to have your cake and eat it too.
[97:32.88]Not fair.
[97:34.02]It's not fair.
[97:37.22]Seasonality.
[97:39.00]Oh, that's cool.
[97:39.52]Tells you when you can get it.
[97:40.16]That's cool.
[97:44.98]Wait, this is just butterflies?
[97:49.05]Okay, that's a lot of butterflies.
[97:52.13]Look at all these butterflies!
[97:53.43]Oh, it's just, okay, it's insects.
[98:00.39]I see.
[98:00.67]I thought this was the butterfly tab.
[98:04.54]Okay, I have some things to sell you.
[98:08.30]I want to offer you...
[98:20.11]A bunch of weeds.
[98:23.13]Beaches.
[98:23.49]A bunch of butterflies.
[98:24.81]A sand dollar.
[98:28.11]A giant clam.
[98:30.43]A... some twigs.
[98:32.07]A bass.
[98:32.85]And a cowrie.
[98:38.18]What?
[98:39.42]Don't sell the butterflies.
[98:43.14]Well, I can sell all the butterflies, but one of each type.
[98:48.44]Right?
[98:52.68]Yeah, so, yeah, what are you talking about?
[98:59.45]I'm good.
[98:59.93]Look at all the fine things you've brought today.
[99:02.39]Allow me to do some numbers.
[99:03.47]4,500 bells.
[99:05.27]That sounds good to me.
[99:06.33]Sold.
[99:06.55]3D Weeder.
[99:23.90]137.
[99:23.94]Oh, don't give me a reason to pull a thousand weeds, please.
[99:29.53]I'll do it.
[99:32.25]The Greedy Grinner.
[99:39.18]This is fun.
[99:40.70]Okay, cool.
[99:41.14]Let's go.
[99:43.40]This is ATM.
[99:46.86]Make sure you donate all the new animals you find for the amazing rewards.
[99:49.96]Yeah, I will.
[99:57.92]Look, we just go back to collecting.
[99:59.36]Look at it.
[99:59.86]Look!
[100:05.11]I just sold a rare fish.
[100:07.29]I did?
[100:07.59]There's no way that was a rare fish.
[100:26.64]Definitely not.
[100:27.88]Oh, you saw the rare fish.
[100:43.12]It was, but okay.
[100:45.72]Is there a way to switch between tools quickly?
[100:51.31]Or do I just have to... There we go.
[101:02.48]Ooh!
[101:03.82]This is cute!
[101:05.79]There's another yellow butterfly?
[101:20.52]What, it exploded?
[101:21.48]Oh no, the end of the line from my flimsy net.
[101:23.40]Oh.
[101:32.03]More bugs!
[101:36.87]From Dark Souls streamer to Animal Crossing, how the mighty have... fallen, what did you say?
[101:44.99]What, because you've played Dark Souls doesn't mean you're not allowed to play Animal Crossing?
[101:49.35]Dude, if you play Dark Souls, you can't play a game like Animal Crossing.
[102:02.66]Wait, this game doesn't have a dodge roll?
[102:05.30]Then fucking don't even load it.
[102:06.79]Don't even install it.
[102:22.82]No iframes?
[102:24.18]Yes, there are.
[102:24.66]Excuse me, there are iframes.
[102:27.40]To catch the bug, you have to... There are frames.
[102:30.56]No, that's invincibility frames, not...
[102:33.77]No, they're not in here.
[102:34.37]Never mind.
[102:50.79]Rare.
[102:52.16]I caught a Prussian carp.
[102:53.72]My skills are sharp.
[102:56.78]You need eye frames to dodge the bees.
[103:12.03]There are scorpions?
[103:13.69]Are there scorpions?
[103:16.35]Oh wait, yeah, there are.
[103:17.07]There are all kinds of bugs.
[103:22.47]I am relaxed the fuck out right now.
[103:24.91]This is... I like this.
[103:25.97]I'm just relaxed the fuck out.
[103:27.79]I'm gonna clean up my area.
[103:40.45]I want it to look nice.
[103:55.09]This is the perfect dream of a sleep stream.
[103:59.31]Whatever.
[103:59.70]That's alright.
[104:02.08]Come on, come here.
[104:05.46]I missed a bug?
[104:06.34]It's fine.
[104:10.41]Get it.
[104:10.65]Can I influence this at all or no?
[104:27.75]With bait, I can.
[104:28.63]Can I influence this at all?
[104:34.10]Oh, maybe I could.
[104:35.08]If only I started talking about powdered fucking Gatorade, maybe the fish would come over here.
[104:41.36]Hey, look at that.
[104:47.58]I caught a bitterling.
[104:49.82]It's mad at me, but only a little.
[104:55.94]Is that rare?
[105:06.38]Very rare.
[105:07.16]Oh, yeah, dude.
[105:09.58]It's very, very rare.
[105:11.62]Very.
[105:19.07]0.5% chance.
[105:26.10]Ah, now my front lawn looks good.
[105:34.08]Don't, just don't ask us about anything.
[105:37.73]Yeah.
[105:38.91]Yeah, that I'm gonna refrain, I think.
[105:41.32]What's the point of asking you guys anything at this point?
[105:45.66]Hey guys, is that rare?
[105:46.72]Yup.
[105:47.28]No.
[105:49.64]And in between there somewhere is somebody saying, I shit my pants or something.
[105:54.98]So, I'm not sure how much useful information I'll get out of chat today.
[106:13.91]I gotta be careful.
[106:14.37]I don't want to take all the fruit, right?
[106:15.95]Don't I want to... Okay, so I have to plant a peach, right?
[106:19.39]Don't I have to dig a hole and plant one of these in the ground?
[106:25.21]So don't throw them all in the trash.
[106:26.65]Any more weeds?
[106:36.49]Nice and clean.
[106:39.15]Oh, I'm asking questions.
[106:40.11]Right, sorry.
[106:42.83]Can you take this game seriously, please?
[106:49.53]How do you take this game?
[106:51.57]Anyway, I'm curious.
[106:59.22]It's a game where you clean your lawn and collect items.
[107:14.60]Is there a, like, a correct way to play Animal Crossing?
[107:17.58]Is there, like, a serious way to play?
[107:19.82]I thought it was just, like, have your eyelids close halfway and throw your line in the water and collect fish while you dig a hole.
[107:27.60]Speaking of fish.
[107:39.96]Oh, big one.
[107:41.30]Huge, huge, rare fish.
[107:45.33]I wonder how rare this one is.
[107:46.51]Oh, come on.
[108:16.48]I got fucking faded.
[108:18.52]I thought it was gonna be there.
[108:21.26]No No He'll be back don't worry he'll be back
[108:44.44]I just gave 5,000 bits $50 from hyaluronic acid.
[108:53.62]Just gave $50.
[108:54.28]Thanks for the huge fucking money drop.
[108:59.78]They say, hey Jerma, this game is amazing, just like you.
[109:02.66]Well, that's fucking very kind of you.
[109:06.06]Thank you.
[109:09.12]Thanks a lot.
[109:11.12]Thanks for the 50,000 bells.
[109:16.33]But seriously, that's a lot of money.
[109:17.75]Thanks for 5,000 bits.
[109:18.95]50 fucking dollars.
[109:20.91]I will use it to buy a Nintendo Switch.
[109:26.44]Thank you.
[109:33.42]Come here.
[109:41.23]He's emulating.
[109:44.16]Emulating day one Switch game.
[109:47.40]I guess is that it?
[109:48.24]I don't even want to discuss this because that's I don't even want to think about that.
[109:53.38]I don't even want to... Day two?
[110:01.99]Fresh water?
[110:02.49]It is fresh water.
[110:03.85]It is fresh water!
[110:05.65]It is fresh water!
[110:23.01]So I did ask the right question in the beginning, and everyone made fun of me.
[110:26.09]There's no salt water here.
[110:27.67]This is not an ocean.
[110:31.09]I have to rename this place, Fresh Crest.
[110:36.41]Now it will be a toothpaste.
[110:40.15]It's a river.
[110:40.75]Yeah, but what do you mean it's a river?
[110:51.27]Rivers have fresh water, dummy.
[110:55.64]Hold on, if a river is connected to the- if the ocean is supplying the water to the river, the river becomes fresh water.
[111:01.58]Logic much?
[111:10.69]Wait, what's this?
[111:11.35]It's a fucking smash ball!
[111:13.55]How do I get that?
[111:18.13]How do I get the smash ball present?
[111:21.29]How do I get this?
[111:22.01]I need a slingshot.
[111:23.63]Okay, slingshot.
[111:24.81]Oh, I want it right now.
[111:45.77]Yellow perch.
[111:47.85]Those yellow birds have to sit somewhere.
[111:49.29]Throw rock at it.
[111:51.21]I'm not gonna be able to get it.
[111:52.47]It's over.
[112:03.56]Every single time I get a fish, people are gonna spam rare with a PogChamp.
[112:11.16]New viewers are gonna think you guys are fucking imbeciles.
[112:27.22]Oh, there's an animal crossing stream.
[112:29.08]Oh, we got a perch.
[112:31.10]Fucking rare.
[112:32.08]What the fuck?
[112:33.06]Rare.
[112:33.54]Wait, what the fuck is wrong with these people?
[112:46.18]They'd be right.
[112:48.58]Hey, slow down there.
[112:50.55]I didn't say that.
[112:51.19]What?
[112:57.62]I caught a yellow perch!
[113:00.75]Nice.
[113:29.98]Alright, yeah, but if I bring a bunch of rares to somebody to sell, doesn't that mean they're not rare if you have a bunch of them?
[113:39.43]Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of them being rare?
[113:41.47]That doesn't make any sense.
[113:46.26]They wouldn't be rare anymore, they wouldn't be.
[114:04.41]Only two perch in existence.
[114:10.56]Oh, I love just picking up weeds.
[114:12.16]I can't play this game.
[114:14.24]What's this guy doing?
[114:19.86]Yo, Jeremy, that spot you found for me is just incredible.
[114:21.74]Thanks.
[114:22.00]Hope we can keep looking out for each other like this.
[114:24.84]It's good to have buddies.
[114:25.88]Re-rack.
[114:27.89]Alright, I've got something here for you.
[114:29.13]Re-rack.
[114:30.21]Thanks again for finding a place for my place.
[114:38.84]That plain cap is perfect for Saltcrest.
[114:41.22]You can try it on.
[114:43.08]Aw, nice.
[114:46.62]Choose wear if you want to put it on.
[114:47.82]You can always change later if you need a workout.
[114:49.90]Rerack.
[114:59.78]That's not even the right color.
[115:00.64]Wasn't it red?
[115:16.91]Wait, can I paint on this?
[115:17.81]Come on, you gotta have something in there.
[115:35.99]I want another fish.
[115:44.91]This is one- I love this.
[115:53.18]A Crucian Carp!
[115:54.82]My skills are sharp.
[116:03.38]Fuck!
[116:03.83]Okay, I gotta get the- Give me the slingshot.
[116:06.87]How do I make a- Can I make a slingshot?
[116:08.45]There's lo- There's just presents everywhere and I'm missing them.
[116:15.10]I gotta go.
[116:15.56]I'm buying the slingshot.
[116:16.34]I don't even care.
[116:16.82]There's presents everywhere.
[116:30.36]Hello.
[116:31.07]Coming in.
[116:33.63]My message is not unique.
[116:35.43]With a sad face?
[116:38.83]What?
[116:39.83]What are you talking about?
[116:40.51]You're good.
[116:42.94]Hey, hello, hello.
[116:43.92]What would you like to talk to me about?
[116:46.12]Uh, uh, uh.
[116:48.18]I found a creature.
[116:52.49]I found a... Freshwater gobby.
[117:00.31]Yes.
[117:06.99]Stop picking- I beg you, stop picking up weeds.
[117:09.33]They're less than chump change.
[117:10.65]You get more from fish or bugs.
[117:12.93]Please look at the ATM.
[117:17.91]Almond or Wi-Fi?
[117:18.85]I'm not sure what you mean.
[117:22.57]You've taken advantage of the DIY bench?
[117:25.42]Yep.
[117:25.60]Almond or... One guy...
[117:36.61]I have seen you tinkering around a bit over there.
[117:38.35]Keep up the good work.
[117:39.03]That reminds me.
[117:40.13]I've been meaning to share some more DIY recipes with you.
[117:43.86]Mind turning on your phone?
[117:55.36]Wood, along with a recipe to craft an axe.
[117:57.58]Yes, yes, I think an axe would become quite useful on this island.
[118:00.00]Because so many other things are made of wood.
[118:01.80]Hope you'll keep bringing me new discoveries to examine.
[118:04.56]It's all part of the island experience.
[118:09.24]How do I make it?
[118:09.68]Let's craft something.
[118:13.52]Alright, we can do... Bonfire.
[118:20.55]Tiki torch.
[118:22.01]I thought those were pencils.
[118:23.43]I thought these were pencils.
[118:27.69]Log stakes.
[118:28.43]Birdhouse!
[118:32.93]Cool.
[118:33.31]How do you make an axe?
[118:35.17]Stone and a tree branch.
[118:36.09]I need one more tree branch.
[118:44.06]Alright, I gotta get another tree branch.
[118:46.02]Go to the ATM, somebody said.
[118:47.20]Sure.
[118:48.76]Oh, how could I forget?
[118:49.42]I should give you an explanation about that terminal.
[118:53.94]That is our Nook Stop.
[118:55.46]It's a terminal for services that will further enhance your island life.
[118:58.68]At the moment, you can use two services, Jeremy.
[119:01.50]Nook Shopping.
[119:02.74]The catalog shopping service for items.
[119:05.40]Second, this terminal serves as an automatic bell dispenser, or ABD, for the Bank of Nook.
[119:11.56]We're also working on a service by which you will redeem Nook Miles for various things.
[119:16.40]Please take advantage of these wonderful services.
[119:18.10]Quite beneficial indeed.
[119:19.06]Yes.
[119:21.16]Welcome to Nook Stop, a multimedia terminal from Nook Incorporated.
[119:25.30]Once per day, accessing the Nook Stop will award you bonus miles.
[119:30.00]Day 1.
[119:31.54]50 miles.
[119:33.86]Alright, Nook Shopping.
[119:39.00]Um...
[119:41.25]I don't care.
[119:42.05]I'm instantly buying this.
[119:43.67]I don't fucking care if it's... I'm just getting it immediately.
[119:50.77]Loafers?
[119:51.74]Oh, it's nice!
[120:00.14]I want these.
[120:00.56]Can I get two elephant slides?
[120:07.13]No.
[120:11.98]Alright, A, B, D. Does it get interest?
[120:26.52]What do I put this in here for?
[120:40.53]Set your system time a year from now.
[120:50.70]Futurama already made that joke.
[120:54.38]Pretty good one.
[120:59.68]Futurama Fry has like a savings account that has like four dollars in it.
[121:04.71]And then, because he fast-forwarded, like, thousands of years, it was worth, like, billions of dollars.
[121:12.46]That's a funny show.
[121:13.34]That's a good show.
[121:20.28]This is a good one.
[121:20.88]Alright, anything else?
[121:23.75]This.
[121:25.47]Shop to it.
[121:30.07]But inflation made it $4 again.
[121:41.88]When are you gonna do a Futurama React stream?
[121:45.66]I can't do that.
[121:46.48]I wouldn't even- I- What?
[121:48.55]What are you talking about?
[121:52.73]Alright, let's go get a twig so I can make an axe.
[121:59.83]Oh, by the way, has anyone ever used the Twitch watches thing?
[122:03.96]Or did that just absolutely fail miserably?
[122:06.60]Did they just delete that because nobody used it?
[122:11.97]hundred dollars in that tree.
[122:25.06]Yeah, so that's what I mean.
[122:26.98]That's how I know that it was a failure.
[122:28.24]You guys don't even know what I'm talking about.
[122:30.12]Twitch implemented a feature where you could watch, like, Amazon Prime TV shows with your audience.
[122:39.38]Like, as a group, with, like, your community.
[122:43.68]But you couldn't have a face cam and you couldn't talk.
[122:49.74]So you just were in the chat, watching the TV.
[122:52.39]It was meaningless.
[122:55.73]It was absolutely meaningless.
[122:58.31]Let's make that accent.
[123:03.78]Like, I could do that on Discord right now.
[123:05.97]I could say right now, hey guys, we're gonna watch... We're gonna watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit right now.
[123:12.29]If you haven't, just go on the Who Framed Roger Rabbit Discord channel.
[123:17.11]And that would be it.
[123:17.79]It's a great movie.
[123:37.46]Wait, campfire.
[123:38.92]Yeah!
[123:40.62]Sure, just make everything.
[123:43.72]What's this toy box?
[123:54.32]Silly me, I need to give you a brief introduction to the box over there.
[123:57.18]That's a recycle box for all the island residents to use.
[123:59.80]You'll be using it for items removed during construction and such.
[124:02.66]If you see anything you like, feel free to take it right on home.
[124:06.51]If the box gets full, we'll get rid of the oldest items first.
[124:09.73]Don't delay in picking up what you want.
[124:12.33]What?
[124:12.71]Cardboard box?
[124:13.71]Yeah, give it to me.
[124:16.83]I'll take the rock.
[124:19.01]Well, I'll just... Okay, hold on.
[124:22.84]I want to sell some shit.
[124:24.78]Sell.
[124:28.90]Sell.
[124:30.30]Oh, that's a lot.
[124:34.44]That's a lot.
[124:35.49]And you can take all the peaches.
[124:37.87]And the butterfly.
[124:39.07]And the perch.
[124:40.95]I want the campfire.
[124:41.65]And that.
[124:43.23]And the free branch.
[124:44.61]And this.
[124:55.21]5700 bells.
[124:55.75]Holy shit.
[124:58.09]Don't sell the weeds.
[124:59.45]Why not?
[125:02.46]I didn't show the yellow butterfly to Nook?
[125:04.64]I didn't?
[125:06.06]I found a creature.
[125:19.03]Uh, this is leftover spaghetti.
[125:23.51]You said you had an animal on you?
[125:27.11]Yes, send it please.
[125:36.96]Proper reward this time.
[125:40.99]I've given you a red hyacinth bag.
[125:44.95]Just a little sampling of a product we sell.
[125:48.20]Go ahead and do some planting, and after a few days, you'll have beautiful blooming flowers.
[125:51.04]Cool.
[125:51.40]Good world, and if you enjoy gardening, stop by and buy more.
[125:56.00]You'll keep bringing me new discoveries to examine.
[125:57.92]It's all part of the island experience.
[125:59.34]Yes.
[126:02.54]Cool.
[126:04.68]Alright, now I'll give you that stuff.
[126:05.76]This is dumpster stuff.
[126:09.87]I'll take it.
[126:10.27]Okay, bye.
[126:14.17]Another slide.
[126:23.29]Alright, I'm gonna break the rock with the axe, right?
[126:25.17]We got some rare shit in here.
[126:39.90]What's that, iron?
[126:41.58]Alright, that's all that's in there.
[126:49.02]Cut this tree down.
[127:13.90]He's hitting it as quickly as possible.
[127:14.98]There's a timer?
[127:15.74]What do you mean, timer?
[127:29.81]On the rocks.
[127:31.03]Oh, okay.
[127:35.34]Alright, what about this big rock?
[127:54.57]Holding an axe outside their tent.
[127:56.49]This is how every Jason movie begins.
[128:00.41]I already got these.
[128:14.60]What's wrong?
[128:15.46]Hey!
[128:16.38]It's gone?
[128:16.86]They're really easy to make.
[128:20.65]Just make like three of them.
[128:27.05]Has my slide arrived yet?
[128:28.05]Okay, I guess I can make some other stuff.
[128:41.77]Wait.
[128:44.24]Wait, I'm gonna plant these next to my house.
[128:45.38]I'm gonna put them right here.
[128:54.18]Okay.
[128:57.64]Huge ass fish.
[128:58.66]That's the biggest fish I think I've ever seen.
[129:07.71]But it did it?
[129:08.23]Ah, it was blocking the way.
[129:09.27]Whatever.
[129:12.05]Ooh, okay.
[129:27.85]Plants.
[129:29.63]Plants again?
[129:35.85]Cool.
[129:36.41]Alright, now we water them.
[129:37.91]How much do I need to water them?
[129:43.62]Just once?
[129:51.52]Oh, they're sparkling, so that's how you know they've been watered.
[129:59.05]Ah!
[130:01.01]Wonderful.
[130:06.61]Greedy Weeder.
[130:07.37]Alright, I've done this.
[130:09.51]Somebody's saying don't pick up weeds, but I need to pick up 10,000.
[130:14.28]Flower Tender.
[130:22.84]Miles for that.
[130:23.47]Nice.
[130:26.41]Nice.
[130:35.39]Okay.
[130:36.61]So now I'm gonna... What is this thing?
[130:39.05]Venus Comb.
[130:42.25]Pay Nook.
[130:44.04]Why?
[130:46.04]No, I want cash.
[130:56.43]Pay off the debt?
[130:57.09]I want cash!
[131:02.93]Ah, Jeremy, hello!
[131:04.27]What would you like to talk to me about?
[131:06.13]I have a creature.
[131:06.85]Look.
[131:11.53]Look at this thing.
[131:13.39]This is a bitterling.
[131:15.52]Bet you think this is real cool.
[131:16.96]Yes.
[131:30.82]You have to mention something about the flowers.
[131:32.06]The flowers that grow will be very strong.
[131:35.48]They'll spring up even if you just plant them and forget them.
[131:37.90]But if you water them each day, that's where the magic happens.
[131:41.42]Watering opens up the possibility of propagating and crossbreeding your flowers to develop rare colors.
[131:51.71]Okay.
[131:52.91]And how might you water them?
[131:53.97]Well, I already have.
[131:55.15]I already did it.
[131:59.01]My accountant warned me about giving this sort of thing away for free.
[132:01.05]I already bought it.
[132:01.73]Here, take another thing.
[132:03.33]Found another creature.
[132:04.69]I found... a... yellow perch!
[132:06.70]Oh, what a catch!
[132:27.98]Send it.
[132:28.90]Oh, hold the phone.
[132:35.08]Someone's calling.
[132:35.62]Blathers, is that you?
[132:41.67]Oh, what splendid timing.
[132:43.77]Yes, do you remember the venture we discussed?
[132:45.51]Well, it's coming to fruition.
[132:46.75]I'm currently stationed on an island that we decided to call Saltcrest.
[132:53.55]Yes, the local fauna are as abundant as expected, just as I told you.
[132:58.04]Mm-hmm.
[132:59.12]How many precisely, you ask?
[133:00.40]Well, there's no way of knowing just yet.
[133:02.42]But I have received, let's see, five outstanding specimens so far.
[133:05.82]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[133:08.28]Oh, seriously?
[133:08.82]Well, that is very exciting.
[133:11.34]Oh, but you'll have to excuse me.
[133:12.74]I'm with a customer right now.
[133:16.08]I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
[133:18.90]That was my friend Blathers, the one who curates a museum.
[133:22.96]Believe it or not, he's going to come to our island to help us identify and preserve the local creatures.
[133:27.07]But I could use your help, Jeremy.
[133:28.09]Since you've done so much scouting and collecting, would you be able to help find a spot for Blathers?
[133:34.95]We need a good-sized space to really build out a world-class museum.
[133:39.64]So do that, keep that in mind.
[133:40.92]Just going down to the beach.
[133:42.44]Everything is going on the beach, because I will always know where the fuck it is.
[133:46.44]I'm never gonna have to open the map.
[133:47.99]Ever.
[133:49.07]It'll just be whatever it is, it'll be on the beach somewhere.
[133:58.58]Let's go.
[133:59.82]Wait.
[133:59.98]I wanna... I can craft some shit, can't I?
[134:12.82]Ooh, look at this.
[134:13.54]Log stakes.
[134:14.30]What are these for?
[134:27.03]To kill vampires.
[134:28.21]That'd be so stupid.
[134:37.45]Simple DIY wor- Oh, I need more hardwood.
[134:40.16]I can put this in my house.
[134:40.96]Alright, I need another axe.
[134:44.24]Okay, I'm gonna make like three of these.
[134:47.22]Here.
[134:47.62]I'll pay my debt down.
[134:51.04]About my moving fees.
[134:55.25]Yes, very well.
[134:56.31]You owe me 5,000 miles.
[134:58.02]What?
[135:01.56]I just got these.
[135:02.34]This is a happy day for us both.
[135:13.26]You're free and clear of debt, living on a thriving scenic island.
[135:15.94]What could be better?
[135:16.46]Well, that wasn't actually a rhetorical question.
[135:19.32]Let's be more specific.
[135:20.14]How is that tent treating you?
[135:21.48]That could be better.
[135:24.55]Sorry to hear that.
[135:26.81]No one ever said that developing an island Paradise would be easy.
[135:29.89]We don't do things because they are easy.
[135:31.59]We do them because they are profitable.
[135:33.07]Hmm.
[135:36.39]Well, yes, I suppose the time is right to discuss the possibility of building a custom house.
[135:39.89]Now there are certain challenges to building fabulous homes in remote locations such as this.
[135:44.39]Challenges that do translate directly into costs, I'm afraid.
[135:47.89]With zero interest financing, an extremely lax repayment plan, anything is possible.
[135:53.64]So, Jeremy, if you ever find yourself interested in a new home, do come see me.
[135:57.24]One more thing.
[135:59.48]We have a Miles Redemption service for Nook Miles you've collected.
[136:02.94]When you access the Nook Stop, you'll be able to redeem your Miles for lots of interesting things, and the chat is just purple with a link.
[136:16.10]What the fuck?
[136:28.29]I would say that this is funny, but it's kind of scary.
[136:33.71]This is scary.
[136:34.73]Why is it like this?
[136:38.44]It's like a hospital?
[137:00.01]Alright, you're freaking me out, man.
[137:01.79]It's a fax machine.
[137:04.67]Okay, let's go.
[137:05.35]Hope you continue to enjoy your getaway package.
[137:07.43]Uh, I want a house.
[137:12.48]Wait, am I gonna redeem Miles for redeeming Miles?
[137:15.96]Yeah.
[137:25.24]Alright, I want a house.
[137:29.67]About my house.
[137:32.19]Oh, Jeremy, have you made a decision about home ownership, ready to move forward into comfort and luxury?
[137:36.89]As fun as living in a tent can be, a house gives you more space and has you put down roots.
[137:41.52]Now, building a house means tying down a new loan in the amount of $98,000.
[137:43.80]Yes, let's do it.
[137:53.41]You get to choose eight different colors for the roof.
[137:55.21]Would you please select a roof color from this list?
[137:58.79]Red, pink, yellow, black, different.
[138:02.18]I don't want red.
[138:02.92]I don't want pink.
[138:04.22]I don't want yellow.
[138:04.90]I don't want black.
[138:05.84]I want a different color.
[138:09.42]Blue, aqua, green, purple.
[138:11.30]It's going to be green or aqua.
[138:15.08]If you had a... Wouldn't a black roof just absorb all the sunlight and make your house really hot?
[138:28.17]Marine or Aqua?
[138:32.09]Aqua.
[138:34.95]Aqua's my favorite color, why would I not do Aqua?
[138:37.57]Homeowners get an automatic Nook mileage program upgrade.
[138:44.39]Give me a moment.
[138:44.93]So what does that do?
[138:51.03]Do I get bonus miles?
[138:56.73]Nook Miles Plus benefits.
[138:59.03]Nook Miles Plus includes a nifty way to earn additional miles for special circumstances.
[139:04.12]This is funny.
[139:05.20]You'll see the details when you launch the app, so please give it a look when you can.
[139:08.52]That's all from me.
[139:11.46]Your wonderful new home should be ready tomorrow.
[139:12.96]Quite exciting.
[139:14.20]Yeah.
[139:15.94]I'm excited.
[139:17.79]I'm excited.
[139:18.09]Can you tell?
[139:18.65]Alright, I need a... I gotta go down to the beach and put somebody's house down there.
[139:30.74]An easy way to earn miles.
[139:31.88]What am I gonna say about that?
[139:32.76]Alright, I need, um... I need some twigs.
[140:04.14]Okay, so where do I want this?
[140:05.78]Alright, residents.
[140:07.34]Residential will be on the left side of the beach.
[140:10.08]And... Ooh, DNA.
[140:13.32]Residential will be on the left side of the beach.
[140:15.74]And shops and stores will be on the right side.
[140:29.29]Residential sleeper.
[140:43.06]I'll get it.
[140:43.44]Little bit further up.
[140:48.50]Almost.
[140:50.00]Gotta go further to the right.
[141:16.45]Here we go.
[141:18.03]Perfect spot.
[141:31.56]Yes.
[141:38.63]Perfect.
[141:38.93]Is this a good spot?
[141:40.23]It is.
[141:47.34]Lapis can set up his place now.
[141:48.56]What are you doing out here?
[141:53.64]You again?
[141:53.98]Is this island not big enough for the both of us?
[141:55.70]Do we need a bigger island, Sparky?
[141:59.22]What's the latest?
[141:59.78]Hey, how'd you sleep last night?
[142:02.70]This island's so quiet at night.
[142:03.92]It's almost weird, Sparky.
[142:06.30]I mean, don't get me wrong.
[142:07.22]I slept like a log, but I wouldn't mind some more action around here.
[142:10.22]What's up, Sparky?
[142:15.74]Nothing.
[142:20.40]He's scaring the fish.
[142:21.12]Get out of the way.
[142:39.69]Yes!
[142:39.97]I caught a horse mackerel.
[142:42.09]Of course, mackerel.
[142:43.73]Hey, look at this.
[142:52.15]What do you think about that?
[142:59.37]Alright, now come in.
[142:59.93]I want a photo of the two of us.
[143:06.43]Come here.
[143:14.32]I want a picture of the two of us.
[143:30.01]No, come... This is fucking weird.
[143:43.68]D-pad?
[143:44.19]I was pressing the D-pad.
[143:46.79]Okay, hold on.
[143:47.57]Let's try this one more time.
[143:52.41]A D-pad only moves the camera so far.
[143:59.85]There's me, I did it.
[144:15.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:43.36]Is this a horror movie?
[145:03.79]I'm trying to get other people.
[145:05.57]I'm trying to get two of us looking over here.
[145:24.28]Ooh, Kara Milestone.
[145:26.98]Nook Miles with a plus.
[145:29.32]Your rank has increased, and you can now use Nook Miles Plus.
[145:33.32]Make it even easier to earn miles as you go about your enjoying your everyday life.
[145:37.66]Special redemption options that only Nook Miles Plus members get.
[145:40.26]Take advantage of this amazing opportunity.
[145:43.94]Okay.
[145:44.10]Ooh, we have a lot of claims.
[145:51.28]Nook Miles Plus.
[145:55.04]fuck dude capture like what earn bells by selling items oh it's times two I get it
[146:15.74]Alright, let's go.
[146:16.14]What did I want to do?
[146:17.30]Alright, from back... Give me a break for a second.
[146:20.38]I thought there was the pyramids back there.
[146:22.71]In fact, I'm taking a fake vacation photo.
[146:26.33]Meet the pyramids.
[146:27.81]Hmm.
[146:51.73]Okay.
[146:54.74]No, you're not in here.
[146:55.82]You didn't come with me.
[146:56.96]You're not on vacation with me.
[146:57.98]Get the fuck out of here.
[147:00.54]Out!
[147:01.46]Out!
[147:02.06]Out!
[147:06.62]Yeah, so just meet the pyramids.
[147:07.84]Just hanging out.
[147:19.66]This picture sucks.
[147:20.32]Why is it so blurry?
[147:27.97]Wait, there wouldn't be a tree.
[147:29.11]Whatever.
[147:43.60]Try hard focusing.
[147:44.94]I can't.
[147:45.44]Put the trees down.
[147:54.15]I can't.
[147:54.51]I'm not even strong enough.
[147:58.78]Alright, there we go.
[147:59.26]I need these twigs because I need to make an axe.
[148:00.70]What was that?
[148:18.10]They stung my eyeball out.
[148:28.54]Uh, is there a doctor on the island?
[148:39.81]Ritz Cracker Eye!
[148:46.28]That's a good one.
[148:47.00]I wanna make like two or three axes.
[149:03.46]It's not permanent.
[149:04.56]That's not permanent.
[149:11.14]Why are none of my net messages unique?
[149:12.76]What the fuck?
[149:13.30]Why do people keep saying that?
[149:17.65]Hey, Jeremy.
[149:18.19]I take it you found a suitable spot for Blathers to set up.
[149:21.59]I'll let Blathers know that he can move in as soon as he wants.
[149:26.89]Good.
[149:27.71]I'm gonna go break some rocks.
[149:34.38]Okay.
[149:35.44]Make a axe.
[149:40.99]Can I make more than one?
[149:44.69]Do I only have enough rocks for that?
[149:47.27]I cannot.
[149:50.05]I mean, I can make another log stakes, but how do I make the birdhouse?
[149:54.07]I need softwood.
[149:56.07]Okay, I want a birdhouse.
[149:58.09]I'm gonna have a huge fire next to my house.
[150:00.17]I'm gonna surround my house with fire.
[150:03.62]The house can't burn down in this game, right?
[150:07.23]Alright, I need more branches.
[150:08.17]Okay.
[150:21.45]Let's go.
[150:23.10]We need a rock.
[150:29.30]Ew, um, maybe you're going for a new look, but that seems a little bit extreme, Rerak.
[150:37.03]Let's talk.
[150:39.69]Hey, isn't that the hat I gave you?
[150:41.85]It looks great.
[150:42.25]It really shows off your head muscle, Rerak.
[150:56.92]Alright, I'm gonna make the birdhouse.
[151:05.74]Talk to Phoebe, Jeremy.
[151:10.07]I will, eventually.
[151:10.87]Let me just pick up this cheese.
[151:32.93]Okay, I want a rock.
[151:34.73]Is there a rock that I didn't smash into?
[151:36.82]But first, let's catch this big fish.
[151:46.44]Did I time travel?
[151:47.32]I did not.
[151:48.92]I did not.
[152:03.73]Yes, you did.
[152:04.19]You did?
[152:09.23]Eat it.
[152:11.35]Uh, swap it with... Oh, shit, I have all this stuff.
[152:15.69]Can't... Wait a minute.
[152:17.03]Oh, man, I got cardboard blocks, log stakes and shit, DNA strands.
[152:22.05]Alright, I'm gonna put it back.
[152:23.53]Throw it away.
[152:28.79]I need a net.
[152:39.87]When do I get my house?
[152:45.09]Okay.
[152:46.27]I'm gonna put down... We got cardboard box.
[152:48.66]Put it down.
[152:49.02]I mean, what's the point of having a cardboard box sitting outside your house?
[153:02.21]Okay.
[153:04.17]Log stakes.
[153:04.87]Here we go.
[153:05.25]I'm gonna make it like a fence over here.
[153:08.17]Right here.
[153:17.91]Um, this is not a fence.
[153:18.83]This is like, I'm gonna put cans on here and shoot it with an old-fashioned revolver.
[153:22.14]I'm going to bed.
[153:37.16]The BB gun, yeah.
[153:52.60]Go to bed.
[154:02.47]Oh, right.
[154:03.39]It's real time.
[154:06.47]The game's in real time.
[154:07.87]Right, right, right, right.
[154:13.56]Right.
[154:15.76]Alright, but...
[154:18.18]I Love You is currently playing.
[154:19.74]Turn it off.
[154:26.65]Um, okay.
[154:28.67]So, if I change the system clock to tomorrow, what if I want to play this tomorrow?
[154:33.43]I have to set this- I'm gonna have to do this forever.
[154:46.83]Well, I'm not done.
[154:47.89]I said I was done.
[154:52.14]Who cares?
[154:53.92]Don't.
[154:54.16]It's gonna fuck your game.
[154:56.36]Isn't Mr. Resetti gonna come out and be like, You think you can pull that shit?
[154:59.44]Not this time, motherfucker!
[155:03.62]It's gonna happen.
[155:10.39]What is this place?
[155:12.01]Dodo Airlines.
[155:15.01]Hang on a second.
[155:17.37]How'd you get in here?
[155:17.99]Could've swore I locked the front door.
[155:19.55]Doesn't matter.
[155:21.12]We're still getting set up in here, so there's no flights today.
[155:24.72]Sorry, bud.
[155:25.22]That should be open for flights tomorrow, though, so be sure to come back then.
[155:37.33]Time traveling is safe.
[155:41.46]Alright, so I got a scenario for you.
[155:43.90]So if I time travel to tomorrow... Okay, I time travel to tomorrow.
[155:49.46]And then my system clock, I change it back tomorrow to the right day.
[155:54.89]Does the game break?
[156:04.44]Probably, no.
[156:07.17]Yes.
[156:08.97]Your switch explodes.
[156:11.59]Oh, I should be careful then.
[156:25.80]Don't you fucking dare.
[156:31.95]If you time travel, you have to commit.
[156:33.27]So that means that I would always have to have my switch be one day forward forever.
[156:40.70]Or what if?
[156:41.24]Why are you asking us?
[156:46.24]I don't know.
[156:47.16]Who's asking?
[156:54.46]Aww.
[156:54.61]You're cheating.
[156:55.89]Cheating.
[156:56.25]Alright, yeah.
[156:56.99]Cheating in the game that's specifically designed for you to play it over a long period of time.
[157:01.91]I have another scenario for you.
[157:07.71]So what if...
[157:10.48]What if we just checked up on this little village?
[157:15.44]And did, like, some chores and stuff, and then just did what we were gonna do on, like, the regular stream?
[157:20.29]You know what I mean?
[157:26.41]What if this is how I, like, ended a bunch of my streams over the next... Oh, I fucking got it instantly.
[157:32.20]Instant.
[157:32.78]Instant.
[157:34.57]Instead of the end of the stream screen, I'm going to read bits and do the end of the stream hangout.
[157:41.27]And just do chores and Animal Crossing.
[157:43.47]I figured it out.
[157:49.68]It's a done deal.
[157:53.84]But I'm not done right now.
[157:54.98]I still want to play it.
[158:06.85]You're gonna get bored in like a month?
[158:09.59]Well, that's alright.
[158:12.24]That's fine.
[158:14.56]Even if it only lasts a couple weeks, whatever.
[158:16.38]I don't care.
[158:17.44]Get it!
[158:25.91]Get it!
[158:31.71]Turn the mini-map to always on.
[158:33.07]Oh, this is new.

[158:58.42]Nook Miles Plus.
[159:04.49]I love how they get replaced.
[159:05.75]There's only one black bass in the whole game.
[159:13.43]Got a new recipe.
[159:17.07]What did I learn?
[159:21.12]Ooh, I can craft this now.
[159:22.06]Should I make this and put it in the house?
[159:24.94]Or should I just make a shitload of these?
[159:27.56]Birdhouse.
[159:29.52]How much, uh... Okay, it's the tree branch and... Hardwood and iron nugget.
[159:34.95]Okay, we'll make a birdhouse.
[159:49.67]There.
[159:50.01]Take the bass.
[159:51.78]No, no, no.
[159:58.14]What should I do?
[159:58.70]I have a creature.
[159:59.68]It doesn't want it anymore?
[160:06.83]Ooh!

[168:55.92]How does this boring stream have this many viewers?
[168:59.12]Oh, well, it's very simple to explain.
[169:02.05]I'm doing my entire family reunion on stream, and this is all just family members.
[169:09.19]Yeah, I went to Ancestry.com and found out every single living person that I'm related to, and we're doing a big family get-together.
[169:22.68]Uncle Steve!
[169:23.92]Uncle Steve always comes back with the funny shit.
[169:25.62]There he is.

[169:35.09]Big Thick Ass?
[169:36.45]Oh, Dad.
[169:37.15]We probably should change that, Dad.
[169:41.23]We'll probably change that.
[169:48.58]Alright, Log Stakes.
[169:49.42]Put it down.
[169:51.88]See, look.
[169:52.40]It's off-center, but it's alright.
[170:00.32]You can't even have that fucking name.
[170:03.81]You can't even have that name.
[170:05.83]You just can't.
[170:07.01]Where's the birdhouse gonna go?
[170:09.05]Next to the cactuses?
[170:09.87]How about back here?
[170:10.71]Alright, this is a good spot for it.
[170:13.25]Yeah.
[170:14.77]Yeah, there we go.
[170:18.20]I need to move these.
[170:20.72]Here.
[170:23.24]Here.
[170:33.51]I mean, in two weeks this will look cool.
[170:36.56]Look, I'm moving.
[170:37.30]See, the box is because I'm moving.
[170:41.48]There's no way that that's a username.
[170:44.58]There's no way!
[170:48.30]Big... Big... No... What?
[170:56.02]That's... Well, congratulations, that name will be gone in probably two days.
[171:04.66]Dad!
[171:06.74]He subbed.
[171:08.48]Fuck.
[171:11.34]There's no way that name lasts more than 24 hours.
[171:13.96]I'm just gonna be honest.
[171:15.38]Okay, that's a good spot.
[171:24.91]I can't fucking believe it.
[171:26.91]Do I have any deliveries?
[171:29.47]Where am I gonna put the sofa?
[171:33.92]You have to mod your dad.
[171:35.28]No, I don't want to mod my dad.
[171:36.58]Alright, inflatable sofa.
[171:44.21]Nice.
[171:45.49]See, we can both have a bed and watch the Switch TV.
[171:58.54]You guys remember those little hot dog bag things that were wicked squiggly?
[172:04.26]It was weird like gooey, slippery thing inside and you could hold it around.
[172:09.14]It was like a little toy.
[172:09.88]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[172:13.42]It was a toy that you held it and it was hard to hold and it slipped around and shit.
[172:21.58]It was like a little baggy tube like that.
[172:23.21]What are those things called?
[172:30.69]They got a name, right?
[172:33.95]It was filled with goo and fake shit.
[172:35.69]Yeah, it was, yeah, those things, what were they called?
[172:37.53]I'm not, that's not what they're called.
[172:39.45]That's not what it's called.
[172:40.41]Hot dog bag.
[172:42.03]That's not what it's called.
[172:45.31]Water worms?
[172:46.03]There we go, right?
[172:47.01]Well, let's see.
[172:47.53]Water worms.
[172:53.72]No, that's not correct.
[172:56.78]Water wiggler?
[173:01.99]Bingo.
[173:02.61]You got it.
[173:04.31]Water wigglers.
[173:06.45]Yeah.
[173:07.21]That's what it looks like.
[173:11.96]Alright, let's hang out and watch some Switch!
[173:17.88]Yeah!
[173:18.48]Ooh, that's as hard as a rock!
[173:23.78]I'm gonna deflate that thing, man.
[173:25.16]There's way too much air in there.
[173:28.54]I thought I was gonna go, like, suck down in the butt crack.
[173:43.42]Frozen water bed.
[173:45.10]Are these already watered?
[173:48.62]They're sparkling and glistening.
[173:50.23]Okay, cool.
[173:53.17]Now, chores.
[174:05.30]I got in trouble for selling those in school.
[174:09.50]Wait a minute.
[174:11.57]Hold on.
[174:12.51]You used to sell at your school... water wigglers.
[174:23.33]What do you mean?
[174:24.26]Like, you brought a bunch in a backpack and were like, Hey man, take a look at this.
[174:27.84]And like, took it out like a wet piece of spaghetti and dangled it in front of people?
[175:06.89]Okay.
[175:09.87]Ugh.
[175:16.00]Hey.
[175:17.02]Uh, we're good.
[175:17.82]Let's move on from that.
[175:18.94]Freeze!
[175:24.64]Anymore?
[175:30.37]Same eye, too?
[175:31.39]Awww.
[175:36.43]Do I have to run?
[175:37.05]Am I not running?
[175:38.51]Wait, what?
[175:39.07]There's a Resident Evil run button?
[175:40.67]Okay.
[175:52.16]Well, at least I got the honey.
[175:54.40]Okay, portable radio.
[175:56.80]Campfire.
[175:57.28]Oh, right.
[175:57.72]I want the campfire in front of the house.
[176:01.02]Right here.
[176:09.15]Light it.
[176:10.25]There.
[176:11.11]Nice.
[176:14.77]Okay, now... I need to find another rock.
[176:38.82]Oh, what time is it?
[176:39.52]Why does it look so dark out?
[176:47.55]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's up with your face?
[176:49.23]Did you get stung by a wasp?
[176:50.95]Does it hurt?
[176:51.41]Are you okay?
[176:52.27]Yeah, they can be mean sometimes.
[176:54.28]All times.
[176:55.12]Gotta be careful around them, you know?
[176:57.50]Uh, well, it's kind of too late to be careful now, but you know what I mean, Sparky.
[177:00.16]I bet that does hurt, though.
[177:02.62]If I had medicine with me, I'd give it to you.
[177:04.59]Tell you what, I'll show you how to make medicine.
[177:07.65]My mom taught me when I was little.
[177:08.95]Here we go.
[177:09.33]Wow.
[177:11.89]Thanks, Sparky.
[177:14.05]Just get all the stuff for the recipe together and you can whip up some medicine in no time.
[177:17.17]Good luck.
[177:18.46]Nice.
[177:34.41]Somebody said mod her.
[177:37.31]Okay.
[177:45.04]There we go.
[177:45.74]That's what I need.
[177:53.69]We had $50 just come in right now.
[177:56.11]$5 million in bits.
[177:58.09]Thanks to the $50 Z-curve.
[178:04.11]Zcurve1, thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[178:07.49]And your message, of course.
[178:09.34]I don't have a fishing rod anymore, so I can't even do this.
[178:11.16]How does this work?
[178:18.58]What did I even shoot that at?
[178:19.52]Uh, you say, it's my sister Claire's birthday today.
[178:25.20]And she wanted her favorite streamer to wish her a happy birthday.
[178:28.47]P.S.
[178:29.61]Play Hearthstone Battlegrounds, because bad streams are good streams.
[178:32.59]Uh, I...
[178:34.56]Hearthstone streams are bad streams.
[178:37.56]And Hearthstone bad streams are not good streams.
[178:41.96]But.
[178:42.96]Anyways.
[178:44.82]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[178:46.96]And hey, Claire.

[179:07.66]Wait, what's that?
[179:08.46]How do I not shoot?
[179:10.46]How do I aim?
[179:17.01]Oh, happy birthday.
[179:18.07]Hope you had a good one.
[179:18.69]Hope you continue to have a good one.
[179:21.53]Taking ice cream is on the way.
[179:22.71]That's right.
[179:23.43]Do I run out of bullets?
[179:31.03]No, stop.
[179:31.71]Put this away.
[179:32.03]It's going to run out.
[179:45.94]Just collect a bunch of sticks.
[179:47.10]Why even not?
[179:48.40]Why not just collect them?
[179:49.42]Do they use rocks for ammo?
[179:53.30]They do?
[179:56.42]Oh, right.
[179:56.72]I did get the new thing.
[179:57.46]Let me see how it's worth using.
[180:01.92]Ah, that is pretty useful.
[180:03.59]That's pretty useful.
[180:04.33]Alright, I'm going to make another axe.
[180:11.91]And I'm going to try to find one more rock.
[180:24.54]Happy birthday!
[180:25.20]In the chat right now?

[180:38.17]I see there's a present floating Do I have to be right underneath it?
[180:44.35]How does this work?
[180:52.74]What is it?
[180:54.22]Open it, open it, open it, open it, open it!
[180:58.34]Spinning wheel?
[181:01.46]Whoa!
[181:02.74]Wait.
[181:03.92]Is this like, uh, Rumpelstiltskin?
[181:05.78]What's that fairy tale?
[181:19.20]That's cool.
[181:20.29]Any more?
[181:25.69]I gotta put this down in my house.
[181:26.57]Pronto.
[181:28.13]Uh, where should it go?
[181:37.90]Uh, right here.
[181:38.28]I kinda wanna cut the tree down.
[181:40.82]It's kinda annoying.
[181:41.48]It's messing up my view.
[181:45.18]Sleeping Beauty?
[181:46.38]No, Rumpelstiltskin.
[181:48.40]What did Rumpelstiltskin do?
[181:51.09]old guy that slept for like a thousand years and had a big beard and he used his beard to make string?
[181:58.65]No.
[181:59.05]Who am I thinking of?
[182:00.83]Who's the guy that used his beard to make string with this stuff?
[182:08.93]Not fucking Gandalf.
[182:17.86]Hold on.
[182:19.27]Rumpelstiltskin.
[182:22.14]This is correct, right?
[182:24.36]Rumpelstiltskin.
[182:26.06]It's a fairy tale.
[182:29.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[182:30.70]Okay.
[182:34.81]Yes, the guy that spins straw into gold.
[182:37.59]The liar.
[182:39.65]Rip Van Winkle is the guy that slept for a thousand years.
[182:41.81]Okay.
[182:49.52]May I put the radio back over here?
[182:53.58]If you eat fruit, you can move trees with the shovel.
[182:55.58]I don't have that.
[182:56.60]When do I get the shovel?
[182:58.71]Oh, I want to go on that vacation.
[183:00.03]I want to go on the vacation.
[183:05.53]And put the radio over here next to the switch.
[183:07.17]This is where the media center is.
[183:11.35]There we go.
[183:12.29]There's like our media center.
[183:13.41]Turn it off, though.
[183:14.13]Conserve battery.
[183:27.90]The next day is at 2 a.m.
[183:29.62]for you.
[183:30.99]Really?
[183:35.01]What did I just get?
[183:36.19]Board?
[183:37.51]Put more furniture in your house.
[183:38.99]Oh, okay, cool.
[183:42.33]I need 2,000 miles.
[183:43.93]Alright, we gotta do cast, master.
[183:47.58]Cast your line carefully if you want to reel in this row.
[183:49.18]You need to nab a bunch of fish in a row without a single one getting away.
[183:52.28]Alright, I'm gonna do this.
[183:54.24]I need another fishing rod.
[183:59.47]Stink redeemed.
[184:03.32]What?
[184:13.56]Give me fishing rod.
[184:14.36]I'll take it.
[184:25.13]Real wink.
[184:27.29]Channel points are all fucked up right now.
[184:30.49]And what else should I make?
[184:31.31]Another what?
[184:32.35]Another bug net.
[184:40.98]You guys, hold on to your channel points.
[184:42.28]Trust me.
[184:42.80]You'll use them eventually.
[184:44.36]There'll be something to use it for.
[184:51.75]No.
[184:55.95]He's got market manipulation.
[185:00.65]What?
[185:01.31]Okay.
[185:01.87]Uh, fishing rod.
[185:03.87]Fishing rod.
[185:04.51]Let's go get- I gotta get six more fish in a row.
[185:12.26]Like this guy right here.
[185:13.06]This'll be five.
[185:17.70]Turn.
[185:18.88]Turn!
[185:20.18]Turn!
[185:23.23]Oh, you're using your points!
[185:24.13]It's a big mistake!
[185:24.75]I'm just being realistic.
[185:26.37]That's a big mistake!
[185:29.94]Just wait till at some point in the next week where, um, if... If, uh, if fucking, I don't know, if... If a million channel points come in, and I fucking missed.
[185:42.59]If a million channel points come in on a stream next week, I'll eat a shoe.
[185:45.69]How about that?
[185:50.95]I'll set it up.
[185:51.49]I'll have it just like shoe deposit.
[185:53.97]It'll be like 100,000 points.
[185:56.29]We'll see.
[185:56.59]If you guys can get there, I'll eat a fucking shoe.
[186:00.49]Rock!
[186:00.89]Oh, I don't have enough... No!
[186:07.20]I need to make another axe.
[186:22.54]Everyone has 100k right now.
[186:23.74]Yeah, but I mean, it needs to be more than 1 million collectively.
[186:27.39]I need a million points.
[186:29.33]I'll let you know.
[186:29.81]I'll turn it on.
[186:30.25]It'll be like shoe-eating deposit, is what I'll name it.
[186:32.97]You get to a million, I'll eat the shoe off my fucking foot.
[186:35.08]I'll pull it off and eat it on camera.
[186:36.14]The second we cross it.
[186:37.76]The second we cross that threshold, I will turn it on.
[186:41.22]And I'll take the shoe off and I'll eat the shoe on camera.
[186:43.91]That day.
[186:44.31]That day.
[186:45.95]That day.
[186:54.84]I swear.
[186:55.14]What, are you going to catch me in a lie?
[187:10.14]Mods, add the word liar to ban list, please.
[187:25.19]Make the medicine.
[187:25.93]Sorry.
[187:29.99]Forgot about that.
[187:30.53]Fuck.
[187:32.03]Fuck.
[187:32.67]Fuck.
[187:36.45]The Drew crew literally spent two million points on that stream to watch for three hours and you didn't do it.
[187:42.37]See, what you don't understand is the Drew crew came together with two million points, but I got a stockpile of a hundred million points.
[187:54.36]So.
[188:03.26]Wasp nest and clump of weeds.
[188:04.90]Oh, that's actually pretty easy.
[188:07.32]He's a market manipulator.
[188:11.24]Actual liar.
[188:13.20]See, the thing is, guys, I don't need to even lie to you.
[188:15.72]Because I'm the one giving you the points.
[188:19.09]I'm the one that produces the points.
[188:21.93]I'm the bank.
[188:33.18]I'm the point factory, yes I am the Senate So it's BB-8 unit then Okay, I need a weed
[188:59.23]I cleaned up all the weeds.
[189:02.27]There are no weeds left.
[189:03.31]I picked up all of them.
[189:04.19]I picked up like 500.
[189:07.01]I picked up 500.
[189:08.09]There are no more.
[189:10.36]I cleaned the whole town.
[189:11.32]There's no... Every single weed is gone.
[189:23.96]Did you already donate to Tom Nook?
[189:25.28]I did.
[189:27.52]There are no weeds.
[189:28.48]I can't even make them.
[189:29.18]I'm gonna have to wait for tomorrow for the weeds!
[189:34.20]What the hell did I do that for?
[189:35.26]What is this bulletin board?
[189:38.73]We use this board to post important notices and other useful bits of information to everyone.
[189:41.49]Yes.
[189:42.73]Highland residents and visitors alike should feel free to use the bulletin board to communicate with each other, celebrate special events, and more.
[189:46.89]Okay.
[189:48.46]Yeah, but just fucking erase it.
[189:49.84]Erase this time.
[190:01.98]Can I put something up here?
[190:07.25]Yeah, I can.
[190:16.70]Wait, I can't write, like, I can't write, like, fuck you or something.
[190:19.58]I'll get banned, right?
[190:45.89]Okay, so is this like baby Jesus?
[190:58.97]What am I doing?
[191:01.94]What am I doing here?
[191:41.78]Fuck, he really is.
[192:25.81]No, not eat.
[192:28.53]What?
[192:33.36]Eat.
[192:38.96]Eat up.
[192:46.16]Eat shoe.
[192:47.56]Eat shoe.
[193:12.72]Y. T. T. O. N. N. O. O. K. S. S. O. U. S. T. K. U. S. T. T. O. I. N.
[193:50.38]Okay, how do I move this?
[194:07.38]No, shit!
[194:10.04]How do I erase the guy in the back?
[194:37.95]Because he's the signature.
[194:40.19]That's Tom Nook's signature.
[194:42.47]Okay.
[194:43.39]How do I get rid of the guy in the back?
[194:45.19]I can't like move him around?
[195:08.19]How can I make the text like a different color?
[195:10.05]Okay, it's posted.
[195:35.66]Wait, my signature's on it.
[195:50.50]Why would I sign that?
[195:52.38]I forged his signature and then wrote my signature on it underneath.
[195:57.27]I gotta take credit for it, apparently.
[195:59.79]Signing a forged letter.
[196:01.11]What the fuck are you doing?
[196:10.05]Influencer.
[196:10.84]Alright.
[196:12.22]I need another co- What?
[196:13.34]How many?
[196:13.78]Hundreds?
[196:19.64]I need 550 miles.
[196:25.12]So let's see.
[196:27.64]Bugs don't bug me.
[196:29.58]You can earn miles for filling out your Critterpedia.
[196:31.46]Can you find every bug and unlock every entry?
[196:37.46]Using a tool until it breaks is proof of your hard work.
[196:45.38]I need a lot of materials.
[196:46.24]I'm giving away Nook Miles based on how much wood you've chopped from trees.
[196:49.42]I could probably try doing that.
[196:50.58]Alright.
[196:54.13]Planting flowers.
[196:54.97]Flower tender.
[196:55.75]I got a bunch.
[196:59.75]Fruit you've sold.
[197:00.65]Yeah.
[197:05.03]Number of seashells you... seashells... Number of seashells you sell.
[197:10.59]Seashells you sell.
[197:11.47]Seashells you sell by the seashore.
[197:14.31]Seashells you sell by the seashore.
[197:16.07]Seashells you sell by the seashore.
[197:17.51]Seashells you sell by the seashore.
[197:18.83]Is that Critmaster?
[197:23.86]Wait, my axe.
[197:25.76]My axe.
[197:26.98]And my bow.
[197:28.80]And my sword!
[197:29.64]And my axe!
[197:32.32]And my bow!
[197:33.92]And my sword!
[197:35.66]Right, how does it go?
[197:48.20]Alright, go, go, go!
[197:50.86]There's a limited time limit!
[197:56.79]Where's that bug?
[198:17.67]Where's that bug?
[198:19.79]Dammit.
[198:28.49]There's like a centipede, too.
[198:29.99]Shit.
[198:33.13]Ugh, I'm... What if I just like fucking SMASHED my controller?
[198:38.12]You think anyone's ever smashed their controller over Animal Crossing before?
[198:47.24]Not going to fucking get away this time.
[198:53.69]Got him.
[198:55.71]Yeah.
[198:56.71]I caught a centipede.
[198:57.53]99 more and I'll have a dollar-pede.
[199:01.71]Okay, dad.
[199:10.16]I need more wood.
[199:16.86]Have I gotten all the wood from these trees today?
[199:18.92]I feel like there's a few I didn't do.
[199:25.00]Yep, here we go.
[199:33.80]Don't miss too hard.
[199:39.68]One, two, three.
[199:46.08]Why can't he do jokes like that?
[199:47.76]Why don't you?
[199:51.54]I do jokes like that sometimes, and people freak the fuck out.
[199:54.78]Is that a bug?
[200:02.93]Wait, what was that?
[200:05.03]That was a bug.
[200:05.59]Wait.
[200:13.95]What?
[200:16.99]Tom, small Tom, get the fuck out of the way.
[200:19.41]Got it.
[200:29.08]Yes, what is it?
[200:30.92]Cinnamon?
[200:32.28]Bagworm, guess I'll bragworm.
[200:50.36]Ah, you knew it was gonna happen eventually.
[200:51.70]Present up top.
[200:59.12]No, that's not a slingshot.
[201:04.89]Give it to me.
[201:07.31]What's in it?
[201:09.29]Open.
[201:11.63]Clay furnace.
[201:13.91]What?
[201:14.09]What?
[201:21.92]Alright, put it in my hut.
[201:26.25]Uh, I'll put it right here.
[201:28.25]Nobody steals this stuff, right?
[201:29.49]This is no crime.
[201:30.89]In Animal Crossing.
[201:35.92]Holy shit!
[201:37.52]What is this?
[201:37.88]Can I actually use it?
[201:43.94]It's a pizza oven.
[201:46.46]That's awesome.
[201:47.80]Display furniture outside!
[201:49.07]Oh!
[201:56.32]What else did I get?
[201:56.90]Anything?
[202:07.43]Okay.
[202:09.63]Did I get anything else?
[202:10.29]Can I cook on this or something?
[202:15.98]I kind of want to put it over here.
[202:27.51]Yeah, that's fine.
[202:28.79]That's better.
[202:31.39]Do the nook miles plus.
[202:34.11]Quick miles.
[202:34.79]What do we got?
[202:41.17]Plant trees.
[202:41.83]I could buy a tree and plant it.
[202:43.53]Okay.
[202:44.69]Catch a bitterling.
[202:46.56]Earn bells by selling items.
[202:47.88]Okay.
[202:49.46]Catch bugs.
[202:50.76]Catch fish.
[202:51.38]Alright, let's do some of these.
[202:53.08]Let's catch some fish.
[202:53.66]How much shit do I have?
[202:57.42]Okay, I got a lot of shit I need to sell.
[202:58.66]This game's very cute.
[203:12.41]Very cute game.
[203:16.50]Okay, so...
[203:24.51]Uh, this.
[203:25.39]This.
[203:26.75]Both of these.
[203:27.29]Uh... Actually, I can't tell the worms.
[203:32.52]The museum's not open yet.
[203:36.00]Do I wait until tomorrow to sell these?
[203:39.66]To give this to the museum?
[203:40.96]Okay.
[203:50.05]Okay.
[203:53.73]920 bells sold.
[203:55.27]Alright.
[203:55.81]Let me make another axe.
[203:59.19]Do I have enough?
[204:08.57]Fuck.
[204:10.09]I need one tree branch.
[204:13.32]Put him on the ground.
[204:14.64]You can put him on the ground outside the museum.
[204:16.46]Will the bug stay there?
[204:17.48]Won't the bug crawl away?
[204:40.37]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[204:49.34]Okay, I have a question.
[204:51.48]Is there... Is there a bot that is just pulling every frame from this stream and selling it
[205:10.53]What the fuck?
[205:15.23]What the fuck, man?
[205:16.56]Alright, let's go catch some fish, catch some bugs, and hit a few rocks.
[205:30.97]Who would buy this?
[205:32.93]I don't think... Look, I understand that there's a market out there for the strange.
[205:38.39]And the odd.
[205:39.51]Oh man, it would be really funny if I... Yeah.
[205:42.35]I'll buy a Jerma985 shower curtain with the Jerma Rumble face on it as big as the whole curtain.
[205:48.28]Yeah, I'll do that.
[205:49.88]And you'll leave it in your closet forever and you wasted money.
[205:52.34]And like three people will do it.
[205:53.90]It's not profitable business.
[205:55.72]It's not.
[205:56.06]You...
[205:59.59]Somebody will accidentally maybe purchase one of them or two of them, and it's not worth it.
[206:03.15]It's not profitable business.
[206:04.15]This is where I look over.
[206:14.54]And I say, how long you been here for?
[206:18.54]Oh, you know, six or seven hours.
[206:21.96]What did that take me, two minutes?
[206:29.61]Excuse me.
[206:30.77]Want me to show you how to do this?
[206:31.53]That's rude.
[206:37.17]Ooh, look at that.
[206:40.39]Alright, I'm almost there.
[206:41.82]I almost have enough for the ticket.
[206:42.82]I need to catch one more fish and catch two more bugs.
[206:46.76]Got it.
[206:56.55]Addicted.
[206:58.87]The whole point of this game is to get addicted to doing random things.
[207:03.75]It's not like a problem to be addicted to Animal Crossing.
[207:07.59]What's that?
[207:07.89]Do I have to hit it with an axe?
[207:10.97]Collect it!
[207:15.55]Oh, it's a hermit crab.
[207:18.89]I think it wanted to be left alone.
[207:21.83]Oh, wow.
[207:22.33]Okay, cool.
[207:26.41]I'm out of room.
[207:28.73]Uh, just drop it.
[207:29.43]This thing's worthless.
[207:33.55]Wait!
[207:33.87]Somebody's here!
[207:34.25]Wait, I can just walk in?
[207:48.58]You have one of these weird sleeping bags.
[207:52.81]These sleeping bags are scary.
[208:07.03]I wouldn't want my head to be covered like that.
[208:08.80]I feel like I'd freak out in there.
[208:13.18]Let's chat.
[208:13.92]This place keeps me so pumped.
[208:20.61]The breeze, crashing waves, nature all around, it's all awesome.
[208:24.51]I just want to jog laps around the island and catch bugs and fish and lift and lift and lift and re-rack!
[208:35.79]How's it going, re-rack?
[208:37.93]At least he re-racks.
[208:49.83]Eight out of ten people that go to the gym don't.
[208:51.65]So I'm glad he's making awareness there.
[208:53.65]Alright, I need to catch another fish.
[209:01.31]Here we go.
[209:08.77]Come get it!
[209:13.45]Put the bugs on the ground.
[209:15.36]Bugs on the ground.
[209:16.18]Bugs on the ground.
[209:17.02]Bugs on the ground.
[209:17.66]So if I put the bugs on the ground, they're not gonna run away?
[209:20.16]Alright, I'm gonna try it.
[209:24.64]I'm gonna put Centipede on the ground.
[209:31.07]Just wanted to make sure you saw it.
[209:32.89]Place item.
[209:34.17]Oh!
[209:34.43]Wait, they have their own little containers!
[209:38.34]Cool.
[209:38.98]I can make my own little pet shop.
[209:44.38]Wow!
[209:52.27]There's no room?
[209:53.15]Oh, turn around.
[210:00.19]Wait, then you need a bigger... You need... These guys need bigger cages.
[210:18.44]This is just a moth.
[210:22.16]I don't want a moth.
[210:25.68]There's like 50 million of them.
[210:36.11]I wasn't looking.
[210:49.82]Roach Ranch is back.
[210:51.08]God.
[210:53.90]I never played that game ever again after that.
[210:55.74]I need one more fish.
[211:12.70]Ooh!
[211:15.19]Russian Crark.
[211:15.99]I think I have enough for the ticket.
[211:20.48]Should, right?
[211:21.96]I do.
[211:24.16]But, let me just get one more bug.
[211:28.48]Wait, I have more.
[211:29.27]Go ahead, be shellfish.
[211:35.37]Oh, I picked up a bunch of seashells on the seashore.
[211:42.85]Right?
[211:43.89]Nook miles for miles.
[211:45.95]Earning nook miles for earning nook miles.
[211:47.81]Yes, yes.
[211:48.25]You just earned miles for finishing nook miles plus goals.
[211:50.85]But where will it end?
[211:51.59]Probably never does.
[211:56.62]You get one for free tomorrow.
[211:58.82]I do.
[212:00.56]But don't buy this with 2,000... How much are channel points?
[212:20.44]Go get the inventory upgrade and the haircuts.
[212:23.78]I will, I just need to catch one more bug.
[212:30.14]Weeds!
[212:31.44]I can make medicine.
[212:33.94]Maybe.
[212:39.81]Here we go.
[212:40.41]Wait, is this the same moth that I had before?
[212:47.86]You just get a free ticket tomorrow.
[212:49.42]So just stockpile my points then.
[212:56.73]Let me see what else I can buy.
[212:57.61]I didn't really look that hard.
[213:05.36]It's 5,000 points for a bigger inventory.
[213:07.18]Let me take a look.
[213:16.98]It is that.
[213:18.68]Custom design pro.
[213:19.72]Pretty good tools recipe.
[213:24.00]Collection of six DIY recipes.
[213:26.31]Tools with excellent durability.
[213:28.87]That's better.
[213:30.59]Market organization guy.
[213:31.69]There it is.
[213:35.41]Top eight pop hairstyles.
[213:38.61]Change your look at a mirror or vanity with these pop hairstyles.
[213:43.33]Cool hairstyles.
[213:44.37]Stylish hair color.
[213:47.54]Some t-shirts.
[213:56.82]Yeah, this kind of does remind me of... Weren't there some old websites where you could redeem points for shit?
[214:11.63]It was like 500 million points.
[214:15.46]like an iPad.
[214:17.28]Oh!
[214:17.54]I wanna ask you something!
[214:19.12]Uh, I saw something on TV about this website where you can buy, like, TVs for, like, five cents and shit.
[214:24.48]They would, like, auction weird, like, fucked up website.
[214:27.22]Where it's like, I got this plasma TV for 98% off!
[214:30.84]How does that work?
[214:34.86]How is that even possible?
[214:36.20]It's just a, it can't be real.
[214:45.09]It's like, I got this iPad Pro for only $3.
[214:47.69]It's just like a weird penny auction site.
[214:54.98]You pay regardless if you win.
[214:57.32]You're the 10,000th person to log in.
[215:02.12]You don't actually pay $3.
[215:11.04]You pay for bids.
[215:13.24]So wait, so if I pay like $50 to bid 3 cents... Then I won a... You pay to bid.
[215:25.02]So I pay $100 to bid 10 cents on this iPad Pro.
[215:32.27]So if I bid 5 times, I pay for the iPad Pro.
[215:39.96]Why would anyone, ever, ever do that?
[215:45.76]For any reason?
[215:47.76]Can you actually get something for like a dollar?
[215:49.54]It's impossible.
[215:54.44]It's just gambling.
[215:56.50]They take your bid even if you fail to win.
[215:58.12]I was so confused.
[216:02.83]I was like, how does it make any fucking sense?
[216:07.43]Because idiots like you aren't sure if it's real.
[216:10.97]What?
[216:12.15]Hold on.
[216:12.57]Whoa.
[216:13.57]Hit the brakes here for a second.
[216:15.11]Pump the brakes.
[216:16.45]I said, this is bullshit.
[216:18.59]That's fucking impossible.
[216:20.11]Those are the first words I said.
[216:22.07]I did not go, hey guys, I'm thinking about buying an iPad for five cents tomorrow.
[216:29.01]I opened the statement with, this is ridiculous.
[216:32.51]There's no fucking way it's real.
[216:34.33]But anyways, how does it work?
[216:38.68]Didn't say I was doing it.
[216:40.02]Alright, am I buying this or not?
[216:48.42]I want the hairstyles.
[216:50.66]Top 8 cool hairstyles.
[216:59.53]Did I get the cool hairstyles or pop hairstyles?
[217:03.93]No, don't.
[217:04.67]It's not worth it.
[217:06.05]Alright, I'll save them.
[217:10.69]Let's put some more money in the bank.
[217:13.36]Deposit.
[217:17.98]I got some cash.
[217:23.38]Get the pocket upgrade.
[217:25.27]Alright, is there anything new in the... I think I have to wait until tomorrow for this.
[217:28.67]I'm going to buy another elephant.
[217:35.43]Hey, good thing I just put that money away because I would have bought a third elephant.
[217:40.53]What do you got in here?
[217:46.09]Okay.
[217:48.27]So.
[217:50.81]I think I have exhausted everything I can do in the game today.
[217:54.37]For the first day.
[217:56.49]That's pretty much all I can do, right?
[218:06.66]Oh, I need to make medicine.
[218:07.50]I'll do that, yeah.
[218:08.80]How many weeds do I have?
[218:12.38]I have one weed.
[218:16.40]Wait, did I only need one?
[218:17.88]How much did I need?
[218:18.46]No, I'm not done streaming.
[218:24.02]We're gonna keep going.
[218:28.84]We're probably gonna go back to Fuckface City for like an hour or two.
[218:36.23]Check on it.
[218:37.09]Maybe make a few adjustments.
[218:41.36]But I do want to see one thing.
[218:42.60]I want to see how much it... what it takes to do the, uh... No, I need more than one.
[218:53.74]Alright.
[218:56.52]Yeah, okay.
[218:56.88]Alright.
[218:58.28]That's it for today.
[218:59.91]Or, no, not the stream, but this.
[219:01.59]Like, Animal Crossing.
[219:02.41]How do I do it?
[219:02.85]Do you just leave?
[219:03.45]Do I just hit... just save the... how do you save the game?
[219:15.57]Helicopter rescue, get me out of here.
[219:22.07]Oh, there we go.
[219:22.57]Ready to wrap things up for now.
[219:23.97]Yes, I am.
[219:24.87]Okay.
[219:25.25]Alright, I'm going to take a quick break.
[219:27.29]I'm going to come back.
[219:28.01]When I come back, we're going to open up the city's skylines city.
[219:34.15]And hang out for a little bit longer.
[219:36.86]Maybe like another hour or two.
[219:37.96]We'll see.
[219:38.22]I'll be right back.
