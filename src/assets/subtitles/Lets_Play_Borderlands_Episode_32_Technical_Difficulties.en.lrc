[00:11.71]Hello, everybody.
[00:12.57]Welcome back to our Borderlands playthrough.
[00:14.73]We're back in action, ready to start stomping some foes.
[00:18.13]Running into some quest trouble at the beginning here, trying to figure out what's going on.
[00:21.14]But, Lepta, how are you doing, man?
[00:23.32]I am good.
[00:23.90]I am just bouncing up on top of this car, just chilling.
[00:27.20]And we need to go travel with this claptrap.
[00:30.48]Shoot your ass in the eye.
[00:31.74]We need to figure out this quest tomfoolery, what's going on here.
[00:38.10]New Haven.
[00:38.66]We've never seen this place before, I don't think.
[00:40.60]Nope.
[00:42.88]I can't say nope without hearing the engineer now.
[00:46.46]Nope.
[00:47.16]Nope.
[00:47.78]I've been to New Haven.
[00:48.68]New Haven, Connecticut.
[00:50.28]Very nice.
[00:51.56]That's an actual place.
[00:53.74]Borderlands takes place in Connecticut.
[00:56.05]Oh, I heard that.
[00:58.83]Imagine.
[00:59.31]Who's that stupid?
[01:02.49]Welcome to Borderlands.
[01:03.83]Connecticut.
[01:04.19]Let's see what they have here.
[01:06.03]They have a Berserker class mod.
[01:07.59]They have some... They have a...
[01:10.90]A hunter class mod for $53,000.
[01:12.60]Let me go rob a bank before I try and buy that.
[01:17.49]How much money do you have, by the way?
[01:23.83]$3,000?
[01:23.85]$3,100?
[01:24.17]Well, I did just buy a bunch of stuff at the end of the last episode.
[01:28.29]Oh yeah, that's true.
[01:29.53]I bought a lot of things.
[01:30.83]Where do we have to turn this in, exactly?
[01:33.47]Let's see.
[01:34.05]Alright, well we have to go far into this city, so let's check that out.
[01:38.95]We got a car.
[01:39.65]The car's back here.
[01:40.61]Really?
[01:41.19]Yeah, it's just sitting back here.
[01:44.01]You wanna grab one?
[01:48.14]A car?
[01:48.48]Oh, I'm just getting our car.
[01:49.84]That was still back here.
[01:53.26]Is the car spawned?
[01:54.16]Okay, cool.
[01:55.38]Oh, and it also has, there we go.
[01:57.78]There's tabs at the top that say, here, you can have this car, you can have that car.
[02:02.75]There's a machine gun car and there's a rocket car, right?
[02:07.04]Yeah.
[02:09.48]And now that we do know how to target on enemies, this should be way easier than that rodeo thing.
[02:15.16]Yeah.
[02:15.56]That rodeo thing would have been so much easier.
[02:20.60]Welcome to New Haven.
[02:37.41]sounds like a little real real jerk yeah who's that so looks like in this building hey who are you ever thought about settling down no I don't want to settle down these guys get like a mask on yeah alright here we have someone in here alright here turn in collect reward very nice oh we got us weapon equip slot as do you nice now we have more backpack space dude really
[03:07.38]I'm off of that.
[03:08.28]I'm off of that.
[03:09.84]Oh, no, no, no.
[03:10.34]We don't have more space.
[03:11.24]We have another weapon slot.
[03:14.12]Oh.
[03:14.50]Oh, yeah.
[03:15.44]People told me to get rid of the static repeater.
[03:17.58]I don't want to.
[03:21.84]I don't want to.
[03:22.34]That's my favorite gun.
[03:23.48]I love that thing.
[03:27.83]Alright.
[03:28.93]So where are we going to go now?
[03:30.03]We're going to go right down there, actually.
[03:33.16]I want to see what's around here, if there's anything we can get.
[03:35.50]And there's a quest that I can get here.
[03:37.46]Power to the people.
[03:38.26]We have to turn on generators around New Haven.
[03:41.91]Oh, you already got that.
[03:45.69]How did I already get that?
[03:47.49]I've never been here before.
[03:50.65]Yeah, I think whatever quest you take, I take too.
[03:53.78]Oh, there's a generator up top there, so do we have to go in through here?
[03:57.24]I believe so, yeah.
[04:02.73]You in here?
[04:03.61]How do we get up there?
[04:06.05]Guess not.
[04:07.41]Might be a different way to go.
[04:08.13]Ooh, walkers.
[04:12.14]Ooh.
[04:13.42]Mad cash.
[04:14.46]Ten monies.
[04:15.14]How much did we get?
[04:17.22]Oh, $29.
[04:17.84]Wow.
[04:18.76]That's enough to buy, like, a McDonald's cheeseburger.
[04:20.82]Oh, I got up here.
[04:22.85]Oh, there's a generator right here.
[04:24.59]I just abused it.
[04:26.37]Ooh, look.
[04:27.27]Weapon chest up here.
[04:29.65]Ooh, ooh, hello!
[04:31.09]GGN blast sniper and a patrol SMG.
[04:34.95]Ooh.
[04:36.73]So I just turned on that generator.
[04:38.64]No idea what it's gonna do.
[04:42.34]Well, this sniper's a thousand bucks.
[04:44.06]I mean, if you want to get it, it's worth it.
[04:48.16]Oh, I just fell.
[04:50.29]Oh, God, I fell, like, into a crevice.
[04:52.55]There we go.
[04:53.91]No, I got a better one.
[04:55.27]Mine's better.
[04:55.97]Nah.
[04:57.19]I got enough worries than having to sell that thing.
[04:59.86]Alrighty.
[05:00.94]Let's go find that other spot, too.
[05:03.06]Alright, it's down there.
[05:04.82]People actually are saying that they're finding about us both through Borderlands, and it's actually pretty interesting.
[05:13.06]I never expected this series to be something that people discovered me through it, you know?
[05:21.59]Yeah, I know, it's weird.
[05:22.77]I mean, I guess because when people just type in, look, they're looking for Borderlands, let's play, so Borderlands, let's play, you know, and they're just kind of searching for it, so that's kind of cool.
[05:32.95]Yeah.
[05:33.58]So if you never know me or Lepter before, nice to meet you.
[05:40.83]Alright, where's the other one now?
[05:41.99]I think we gotta go back, right?
[05:45.97]Yeah.
[05:47.73]Northgate power.
[05:48.77]Oh, no, wait.
[05:49.57]I have a skill point I can use.
[05:51.97]Well, you gotta put that in before people yell at you.
[05:54.35]Oh, I can get that final one.
[05:56.67]Why don't you use your skill points?
[05:59.94]Put that skill point in Lepter.
[06:01.32]Are you nuts?
[06:04.74]home and so on that and then finally I have a each for you fires a chance a day's enemies which is actually really well you stuck in need I threw my purple I'll hurts like on fire fire thing so washing machine with stuff in it I that's kinda funny ladies there's that one now there's I was a year

[07:03.65]Here's the last one.
[07:06.16]I believe, at least.
[07:07.94]Nope, there's another one.
[07:08.72]Apparently.
[07:10.92]I'm trying to get up here, because there was a box up there, an ammo box, from the looks of it.
[07:16.82]Oh, well, the gate's open now.
[07:17.95]We just have to go turn it in.
[07:19.53]Yeah, just give me a sec, because... Hey, what gate's open?
[07:23.95]The power generators?
[07:25.15]We were doing that so we could turn the gate on, so the gate would open.
[07:29.45]The gate looks like it's now open.
[07:30.38]Now we just have to turn it in.
[07:33.04]Let the lady say, thank you for turning on the power.
[07:36.32]Wait, I just want to see this weapon chest.
[07:40.85]Alright, alright.
[07:41.55]Shotguns, this is shotguns.
[07:46.13]You know, I'm still going to take all these things at face value.
[07:50.23]Sell, sell, sell.
[07:54.11]Damn it.
[07:54.71]I didn't mean to press that button.
[07:56.47]What else do we have here?
[08:01.48]No, people were like, you're an idiot for selling Sledge's shotgun.
[08:05.80]And I'm like, yep, sorry.
[08:07.47]Here, wait, where do we have to turn in?
[08:09.23]Oh, washing machine.
[08:09.91]I think it's over here.
[08:11.19]Alright.
[08:12.55]I think it's this lady in this room.
[08:16.89]Over here.
[08:17.47]We actually haven't played this in a while.
[08:18.93]When's the last time we played this?
[08:20.89]Probably at least a week ago.
[08:22.21]At least a couple weeks ago, maybe.
[08:26.24]Down here.
[08:28.98]I'm just checking what's on sale here.
[08:32.06]Someone's shooting at you.
[08:34.06]Someone's shooting at you.
[08:37.61]It's me.
[08:40.75]Why do I keep pressing that button?
[08:44.03]This city is pretty cool.
[08:46.33]It's actually enclosed.
[08:48.69]It's not just like a hut with a couple doors.
[08:50.71]Alright, here we go.
[08:54.17]We got some XP from that.
[08:55.73]Seek out Tannis.
[08:58.78]Alright, so we have to talk to a Claptrap.
[09:02.21]I'm looking for some combat.
[09:04.67]Yeah.
[09:06.27]I think we may have a problem.
[09:09.11]Why?
[09:09.93]Because I'm not getting any experience for anything you're turning in.
[09:13.37]Really?
[09:14.13]No.
[09:17.09]Here, wait.
[09:17.91]Do you remember what that last thing was called?
[09:19.59]Let me see.
[09:21.29]Completed... Does it go in order?
[09:23.63]I hope it does.
[09:24.37]Claptrap Rescue Safehouse.
[09:28.40]Oh, no.
[09:30.12]Because it says I'm ineligible for these, I guess.
[09:33.12]But we already did this.
[09:34.19]We did this.
[09:37.77]Like, I'm not sure what the... How I would be behind you.
[09:43.39]It doesn't make any sense.
[09:44.79]I'm trying to think.
[09:53.40]You know what?
[09:53.80]I think there was a Borderlands patch...
[09:57.58]There was a big 300 meg Borderlands patch, and I think it might have kind of screwed up our game.
[10:07.67]Do you have that next target thing that I'm looking at, man?
[10:11.35]I have it.
[10:11.87]It says Tannis found, but it says ineligible.
[10:14.88]Really?
[10:15.56]So I think I can play through the game with you, but I'm not going to get any experience with any of the quests.
[10:21.62]uh... do you want to restart the recording like it was a little and the game in the world we set it back up and all will still be in this area so yeah let's I mean because that without that just sucks I mean I don't know because it did you sell the Patrick it was a huge like two hundred three hundred back that I didn't see it because I leave us the monogram yeah there was a big catcher Borderlands and I think it kind of screwed us up so let's see how it's right again try to get back I hope for a uh... what what's maybe other than I should host the game that
[10:50.64]See you guys in a second.
[10:52.44]Yeah, sorry about this.
[10:54.94]Alrighty guys, hello again, hello again.
[10:57.62]This is the deal, basically.
[10:59.72]We just went back and had to do a couple of quests that Jerma, for some reason, didn't have completed.
[11:06.25]And I guess it's because of that patch that glitched out or whatnot, but the gist is that hopefully, upon turning this in, everything starts working again.
[11:18.17]So Jerma, do the honors.
[11:20.68]Let's hope so.
[11:22.10]Holy crap, this woman's old.
[11:24.34]Those scars.
[11:25.58]Alright, so we gotta... Oh no, all we have to do is turn in this.
[11:31.10]Power to the people.
[11:32.40]This is the thing that we have to do now.
[11:34.98]Turn the power on the generators.
[11:37.37]Oh, we have to redo that again?
[11:40.53]Yeah.
[11:41.05]I guess basically what happened is Borderlands came out with a huge patch.
[11:46.11]And I guess it kind of broke co-op, I guess, because...
[11:50.36]I had to go back and do like three or four quests like Leptis said.
[11:52.88]It was pretty weird.
[11:54.17]But we're on the same page now, so it should be okay.
[12:00.13]I'm looking around for all the random generators.
[12:03.19]There's one over here too.
[12:08.01]Oh my god.
[12:09.19]Oh, we have to rescue this guy.
[12:10.55]That's the best though.
[12:13.25]We really could use the extra backpack space.
[12:16.61]claptrap rescue okay so there's one more the rooftop on the West Gate and I kinda wanna find a new like really good shotgun to kinda equip as my fourth gun because I do have that space right here instead of that static SMG because I have couple of them yeah I have two static guns the better one being let's see
[12:46.64]is this one better is this one better got this one that one's on yeah that one's better well this one looks way damn cooler don't get much better than that did you get it did you get the last one
[13:15.04]uh... but is it's back uh... it's near you you're walking over towards a right now audit that this one on the roof that one's right here is the one with the jump and get before we go well can I make the job yet medical part of the people of our on the same page to turn this in and we can just get going
[13:43.82]Here, Jeremy, you do it so that it doesn't glitch out at all.
[13:47.58]There we go.
[13:47.82]I'm going to select that claptrap rescue because that one's really, I mean, it's a good one to be doing.
[13:54.20]Yep.
[13:54.32]I've got to put a skill point in.
[13:56.51]Hold on.
[14:04.91]Why isn't it letting me select this one?
[14:08.25]Oh, do we have to go all the way back to the haven?
[14:10.65]I think I have to select it because I hosted it.
[14:13.31]Yeah.
[14:14.13]So which of the clap track, New Haven one?
[14:15.51]Yeah.
[14:15.67]This one?
[14:16.19]Okay, cool.
[14:17.47]It's being tracked right now.
[14:19.67]For me, it's still Seek Out Tannis.
[14:21.87]Oh no, there we go, it finally did it.
[14:24.11]Repair kit.
[14:24.59]Alright, where do we have to go?
[14:27.09]Apparently there's a repair kit right here, I think.
[14:31.08]The map says.
[14:31.48]Is it on the roof?
[14:33.38]Oh, I don't know.
[14:34.28]Maybe in this... Maybe it is on the roof.
[14:37.90]Yeah, seems like it.
[14:38.66]You have to jump up here and then... Ooh, hello!
[14:43.56]Bye.
