[00:15.17]First of all, PAX East was amazing, and a special shout-out to everybody I met there, all the people I hung out with, all the cool dudes that really came out to say hello.
[00:23.79]It was amazing, a lot of fun, a lot of friends.
[00:26.01]And I just want to say that a lot of this footage is a little bit on the low-quality side.
[00:30.82]I wasn't going there as really press, but I wanted to get a couple iPhone interviews, wanted to do some, you know, Sony Handycam stuff, so keep that in mind.
[00:37.60]The audio isn't really the best you'll ever hear in your life.
[00:40.56]and I have about maybe enough footage for one more video I'm not really sure about that but we shall see but enjoy this video guys and I'll see you all soon so take care everybody we're on our way to the pc free play right now pc free plays where it's at am I right hey hey pc pc free plays where it's at right right come on we gotta get a chant going

[01:21.97]I'll tell you what we're going to play.
[01:23.58]We're going to play Team Fortress 2.
[01:25.26]Team Fortress 2.
[01:25.94]Team Fortress 2.
[01:27.18]Team Fortress 2.
[01:28.72]Team Fortress 2.
[01:30.16]Team Fortress 2.
[01:31.66]Team Fortress.
[01:32.76]Oh, everyone hates me.
[01:34.55]How do we even get downstairs?
[01:36.71]Oh, man.
[01:42.59]Right there.
[01:43.07]That's where we're going, boys and girls.
[01:44.69]We're going to the PC free playroom.
[01:46.50]Wait, hold on a second.
[01:47.72]Hold on.
[01:49.82]Hey, is that... This down here is, uh, I think that's like the tabletop stuff.
[01:57.84]It's fun.
[01:58.58]It's a fun time.
[02:00.10]I highly suggest... Oh, it's going this way.
[02:02.84]Going this way.
[02:04.94]Look at all those PCs.
[02:07.87]I wonder how much energy this is using.
[02:10.67]Like, how much electricity is powering all these computers?
[02:13.79]Oh, my God.
[02:16.69]Jeremy here with Dan from StealthMachines.com.
[02:18.49]This is a crazy PC building company.
[02:20.33]I'm going to let him go off and tell you what it's all about.
[02:24.13]Go ahead, Dan, tell them.
[02:25.35]Basically, our company started with $200.
[02:27.94]It was eight years ago, and all we did was build the best machines we could, and we used the word of mouth of building the best machines.
[02:35.88]Now we're finally starting to market.
[02:37.94]We're getting our name out there besides just Peer Gamers.
[02:41.14]We have a 10-year warranty and almost a perfect record.
[02:44.43]A 10-year warranty.
[02:46.97]Most PC builders, they have like a three year warranty, but you have to pay for a four or five year warranty.
[02:53.69]So a 10 year warranty is like, that's insane.
[02:57.15]This is the first time I just walked over here, we were looking at this stuff, and it was like, oh my God.
[03:03.95]Dude, you've got to go home.
[03:05.69]Just everywhere.
[03:07.03]No matter where you are, they'll get you.
[03:10.21]You can hand deliver anywhere.
[03:12.86]Hell yeah, man.
[03:14.22]Next time.
[03:15.52]Take a look at this beast.
[03:19.36]So this is the fastest AMD graphics card on the planet right now.
[03:24.50]It's the AMD Radeon 7970.
[03:26.36]Over three gigs of RAM.
[03:29.18]Oh my god, there it is.
[03:31.15]Look at that alien spaceship.
[03:55.10]I'm here with Dee, who is the creative head, and the guy responsible, I guess you could say, for Dust and Elysium Tale, which is an Xbox Live Arcade release.
[04:04.05]Coming out, no release date yet, but he's still working on it.
[04:07.29]He's done everything for this game.
[04:09.60]So I want you to introduce yourself to the audience and tell them what you're doing here.
[04:12.92]It's amazing.
[04:13.70]Alright, so I come at this as an artist, you know.
[04:17.10]My background is in animation.
[04:19.47]And I wanted to learn how to program.
[04:21.05]So I decided, you know, I'll pick up X and A and C sharp.
[04:24.20]And before I knew it, I started making a gig.
[04:26.74]And Microsoft showed interest in it.
[04:28.66]And now here I am, almost four years later, showing up at PAX, and it's great.
[04:34.27]Four years of work.
[04:35.75]Yeah.
[04:35.93]So let me get this.
[04:36.65]You did all the artwork.
[04:39.05]You're doing all the programming.
[04:41.23]What have you not done on the CD?
[04:43.13]I'm not handling the audio.
[04:44.37]I've got people having music.
[04:46.15]But I'm doing all the design.
[04:47.66]It's crazy.
[04:51.12]But it's a dream come true.
[04:52.70]Anything you can give us about when it potentially might be coming out?
[04:56.54]Well, the game will definitely be finished this year.
[04:59.70]Well, we found it.
[05:00.50]The Team Fortress 2 store.
[05:01.50]Look at all that stuff.
[05:19.61]I'm about to instantly transform my outfit into one of these.
[05:25.13]Absolutely.
[05:28.89]Who's Kirby?
[05:38.92]Who's Kirby?
[05:41.54]Kirby's gonna whoop everybody's ass.
[05:56.20]Pax East, bitch!
[05:57.76]Burger Boy.
[05:58.58]Pax East.
[05:59.69]Yeah!
[06:01.91]So, Burger Boy, I was talking to you the other day, and I figured out that... That was a spy.
[06:05.51]That was a spy.
[06:06.11]Spy!
