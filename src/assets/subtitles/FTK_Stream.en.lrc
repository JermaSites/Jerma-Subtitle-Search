[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.71]Hello!
[00:06.57]We're an hour and ten minutes late, but who cares?
[00:12.11]Good, good, good, good, good.
[00:13.61]Hi, how are you?
[00:16.30]I am as excited... Get these people away from me, by the way.
[00:21.08]If you're within like a ten second radius of the king.
[00:26.18]We have a little bit of... We have some problems.
[00:28.58]We're trying to get through.
[00:29.60]There are currently, I think, two or three hundred people on the server right now.
[00:32.56]Welcome to FTK, the first alpha test of FTK.
[00:39.02]It's a 10 second race.
[00:40.44]I'm Jerma, how are you?
[00:41.42]Good to see you.
[00:42.74]We've been debugging back and forth.
[00:47.22]But the kingdom is currently full with people at the moment.
[00:52.37]Some of which I don't know where they are.
[00:56.75]Early access, early access, yes.
[00:59.25]Yes, very much so.
[01:02.54]This is the first he killed three people.
[01:05.04]I didn't kill anybody, okay?
[01:06.68]I've been debugging his server!
[01:09.38]Well, I haven't, but there's been some devs.
[01:12.36]If you're in the game right now, a couple of very important things.
[01:16.04]Actually, I need to tweet this.
[01:17.59]I don't even know where the fuck is my phone.
[01:21.05]I have no idea where my phone is.
[01:25.11]Way more people were interested in this than I thought were.
[01:30.27]There is no whitelist.
[01:32.33]We had to can that last second because there was a lot of API problems that we had to work around.
[01:38.87]But no shit, Sherlock.
[01:42.58]Look, I know, I know, I know.
[01:45.94]It's a new video game.
[01:47.64]Look, I'm outside right now and I got a fucking paddle and I'm in a boat and we're just rowing.
[01:55.92]We're just rowing in the water.
[01:57.20]No one's ever done anything like this before.
[02:00.77]We're charting new territory!
[02:05.37]Show us?
[02:07.97]Oh, we can show you right now.
[02:11.97]It's an eight-year-old game.
[02:14.69]Little did Jerma985 think that 5,000 people all trying to connect to the same server at the same time, even with like three servers and a bunch of shit in place.
[02:25.21]I mean, he's just a fucking idiot.
[02:26.73]That's all you need to know.
[02:30.17]Anyways, I'm surprised no one's tried to attack me as the king.
[02:34.82]But if you can see the screen here, I'm not sure if we can see anything.
[02:38.82]This is the kingdom.
[02:43.52]Welcome, everybody.
[02:45.08]There are currently fucking hundreds of people in here.
[02:49.40]And you know how this game works.
[02:51.92]So if anyone gets too close... I'm going to my throne room.
[02:55.56]I'm like, guards, stay with me.
[03:03.11]If anybody tries anything, just get rid of him.
[03:06.61]Push him off.
[03:10.39]This is my bedroom, if you wanted to see.
[03:12.49]There's a ton of people in my... I don't feel safe right now.
[03:15.04]We look like crazy.
[03:17.44]Oh, and there's the music!
[03:20.04]Welcome, everybody, to Fuck the King!
[03:24.93]Oh, it's because they're all children.
[03:26.37]Right, okay, I get it.
[03:30.85]Somebody just punched me.
[03:32.17]Somebody just punched me.
[03:33.59]I don't know who it was.
[03:34.25]Alright, I'm gonna go down to my throne.
[03:39.98]The server actually is stable.
[03:42.16]You gotta be kidding me.
[03:42.94]I'm so happy right now the server's stable.
[03:45.64]We were getting fucking screwed.
[03:51.23]If you are under...
[03:59.25]If you are under the age of five, you can't mine.
[04:03.67]So that's why everyone, get away from me.
[04:05.65]I'm gonna punch this person.
[04:08.25]Wait, are you a mod?
[04:09.17]Alright, this is the dining room.
[04:17.75]You can't mine until you're five years old.
[04:24.38]I can't believe, why is nobody trying to kill me?
[04:26.97]This is the throne.
[04:27.86]Alright, if you're on the throne... You just killed that person.
[04:31.46]Okay, that person's dead.
[04:39.50]Don't let anybody on the throne.
[04:45.83]Somebody got killed.
[04:50.41]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the kingdom, all of you.
[04:56.83]What did you throw to me?
[04:58.28]The king needs to eat.
[05:00.52]Get the fuck out of here!
[05:01.70]Go exist in the kingdom!
[05:08.36]Why are you all standing here?
[05:13.36]Why are there a hundred of you standing in front of the throne?
[05:18.69]Get out of my castle!
[05:21.87]Okay, alright.
[05:23.73]If the throne room has anyone in it in the next 15 seconds, you will die.
[05:32.34]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
[05:53.95]Fifteen.
[05:54.97]Oh, you just made it out.
[05:56.83]Go exist!
[06:00.91]My gods will protect me from all this bullshit.
[06:05.92]Oh, this food is delicious.
[06:10.92]You know, there's an entire kingdom.
[06:13.90]In fact, it's so good to see you.
[06:17.18]I may, in fact, have a song that I would like to sing.
[06:21.68]It's so good to see everyone.
[06:29.54]You're all so wonderful.
[06:31.88]This is the first stream of the kingdom.
[06:35.22]I think I have a song coming on.
[06:37.22]What a little town.
[06:46.96]What a quiet little village.
[06:51.42]Every day, like the day before, absolutely beautiful.
[06:58.90]There's so many people here.
[07:01.46]Come with me.
[07:06.76]What a quiet village.
[07:07.64]The castle, and all of its participants, the hundreds of them.
[07:18.57]I just have one thing to say to you.
[07:20.93]Bonjour!
[07:22.01]Bonjour!
[07:22.85]Bonjour!
[07:25.50]There goes the baker with his tray like always.
[07:29.56]Don't hit me!
[07:32.44]Every day it's just the same.
[07:34.17]In the kingdom, just the same.
[07:35.97]Alright, kill them!
[07:36.87]Kill them!
[07:37.83]Kill them!
[07:38.31]They're attacking!
[07:39.99]Kill them!
[07:43.67]I'm going back to my castle!
[07:48.30]I can't sprint!
[07:50.22]Kill everyone!
[08:01.31]We shouldn't have attacked them!
[08:04.57]Okay, let's get back to the castle, because we just deleted like 30 people.
[08:09.29]By the way, uh, this is the first ever test, uh, of FTK, sir.
[08:11.71]There's no way I'm gonna die.
[08:12.75]I am not gonna die.
[08:33.15]Those are all babies.
[08:34.35]How old were they?
[08:36.36]Somebody just wrote, what am I supposed to do?
[08:40.46]Kill this guy!
[08:42.16]No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[08:43.26]A day like always, we check the garden and the stalls.
[08:56.24]Every morning, just the same.
[08:57.64]Me and my guards, we have to tame all the crazy people that will try to jump to the server at the same time that 5,000 connections crash the server.
[09:09.37]Get them away from me.
[09:16.73]Okay, let's... let's...
[09:19.19]Delete the music from Beauty and the Pig.
[09:22.19]Because we will get the vomit claimed in less than five minutes.
[09:27.22]So we should probably get rid of it.
[09:30.88]There goes the baker.
[09:33.20]The vomit is going to be defucking deleted if you do not kill this music.
[09:39.85]What a beautiful garden.
[09:41.65]What a wonderful garden.
[09:43.51]I couldn't think of any that have a random garden.
[09:45.45]Thank you for your participation.
[09:47.29]Thank you everyone for joining the server.
[09:49.49]Where's the castle?
[09:58.38]My trusted guards, let's go over them one by one.
[10:02.04]Cad, the video game developer.
[10:05.74]We're ready.
[10:07.52]Destroyer.
[10:08.84]Fresh-baked flakes, the cereal worker.
[10:13.14]Are you a guard?
[10:14.08]I don't know.
[10:18.18]Supressor, the suit-based guard.
[10:21.46]He doesn't know his own kingdom.
[10:25.10]We must find... You have to eat food or you can't participate.
[10:28.06]The king needs to get back to his castle.
[10:29.51]Will one of the guards please show him how to get back to the castle?
[10:34.18]And by the way, there is no whitelist on this server.
[10:36.67]You are going to be manually landed because this fucking API was fucked!
[10:44.49]My kingdom.
[10:45.37]I'm currently in the Outer Lands right now.
[10:49.47]TP me to the castle.
[10:50.91]The king requires a TP to the castle.
[10:54.22]Because he's stupid and doesn't know where his own shit is.
[11:01.36]TP me to the castle.
[11:02.58]I don't know where it is.
[11:04.51]The king can cheat if he wants to.
[11:11.38]Can I just say, oh, and there's the throne room.
[11:16.92]My beautiful throne.
[11:18.02]Nice fail RP, somebody said in the chat room.
[11:23.66]Well, that person can fuck off.
[11:29.18]Currently in my throne room.
[11:31.67]The king will exist here until someone just punched me.
[11:36.85]Get that person out of here.
[11:38.73]I don't want them in my kingdom.
[11:40.41]I don't want them near my throne.
[11:47.39]Currently 31 years old.
[11:50.91]And if we could start to... I know at least 30 people died right there.
[11:54.90]If we could bring some more people into the server, it would be fantastic for you.
[12:01.68]It's been one year, and the harvest has been completely fruitful.
[12:18.64]Why?
[12:18.92]Why did this happen?
[12:20.72]Fuck.
[12:29.83]I would like to address the crowd, if I may.
[12:32.55]I'm going to go up to my balcony.
[12:37.41]Whoops, that's a wall.
[12:41.83]Remember, there are up to two, three, four hundred people in the server at the same time.
[12:46.72]In my kingdom, in my journey.
[12:49.34]There's nothing in this chest.
[12:55.18]I'm going to go visit the outskirts.
[13:00.71]I see only about 10 people in the courtyard.
[13:08.91]The king has been drinking for the last hour and a half, because the king was not sure this server was going to turn on.
[13:15.61]So he's a little tipsy at the moment, if we can just be very Frank.
[13:22.28]My subjects, some of you which are not even present at the moment, how have none of you started to eat?
[13:33.31]Here, take a few chickens on me, your king.
[13:40.43]In fact, have a few mutton, too.
[13:42.99]I'm a good king.
[13:43.89]You don't want to get rid of me.
[13:47.75]I'm a good king.
[13:52.01]How many people are here right now?
[13:53.79]Where are all of my subjects in the kingdom of Germelonia?
[13:59.35]Yes, that's correct.
[14:00.49]That's the name of this whole thing.
[14:02.61]I just came up with that right now.
[14:04.79]Jim Maloney.
[14:07.85]Are you dying of starvation yet?
[14:09.29]I somehow have de-aged.
[14:11.81]I have gone back a year.
[14:14.19]I was 31 and now I'm 30.
[14:17.99]My loyal subjects, if you could please do something for your very, very, very noble king,
[14:29.97]I require a gold block statue of my likeness in the middle of the outlined courtyard within the next 30 minutes, or I will execute 50 people.
[14:47.49]I want a gold dick that's representative of my life.
[14:54.66]I will show you.
[14:55.36]Wait, I don't want to fall off the edge because I deleted.
[15:02.83]Why don't I have this?
[15:03.53]Here, take this, you fucking peasant!
[15:06.19]I say that in a very noble way.
[15:09.71]Would anyone like a piece of bread?
[15:15.51]By the way, my loyal servant, my loyal guard, if anyone comes up these stairs, kill them instantly.
[15:26.97]I want a gold statue of me, and I'll show you where it is.
[15:30.79]I'll show you where I want it.
[15:31.89]Guards, come with me.
[15:33.85]Set the castle on fire.
[15:36.43]Set the castle on fire.
[15:37.33]Good luck.
[15:44.12]I'm getting lost in my own castle.
[15:49.36]Who is this person?
[15:50.60]Why are they in here?
[15:53.84]Oh, bread for the king.
[15:55.06]Thank you so much.
[15:55.88]I appreciate it.
[15:58.76]You're doing a very good thing.
[16:00.83]Thank you for the bread.
[16:02.21]Let me show you.
[16:07.49]Follow me.
[16:08.19]I'll show you.
[16:09.01]Somebody just punched me.
[16:11.13]Who just punched me?
[16:12.31]I'd like to know who it was.
[16:13.71]Oh, I'm going a little too far.
[16:16.45]The common people.
[16:21.11]This bread is just no good.
[16:22.49]Here, someone else eat this.
[16:27.94]How did you make 64 bread?
[16:31.83]That was impossible!
[16:34.68]Don't let them in!
[16:35.34]Don't let them in!
[16:36.58]Get these!
[16:37.50]Fishes!
[16:39.20]What?
[16:39.70]I will shower you with love!
[16:42.81]Keep following me!
[17:03.02]Shit.
[17:04.62]I'm away from everybody.
[17:07.48]I don't have any cards.
[17:08.98]This is a mistake.
[17:12.54]Where are my cards?
[17:16.15]I would like the gold statue.
[17:17.65]By the way, I'm not kidding.
[17:20.11]If there's not a gold block statue right here.
[17:25.45]Right here.
[17:26.81]Where I'm standing in 30 minutes from right now, I will execute 50 people.
[17:31.29]Good luck.
[17:32.43]Start the timer now.
[17:42.43]We can't mine.
[18:04.74]If you're outside of the red border, you can do whatever you want.
[18:10.24]Inside of the red border is where you cannot do anything.
[18:14.86]You can do whatever you want outside as long as you were five years old.
[18:17.55]Okay, good luck.
[18:19.63]How is this already done?
[18:22.75]Where did this person get the gold blocks?
[18:25.65]Is this person cheating?
[18:29.58]How did they get gold?
[18:30.48]No, there's no way they have that many gold blocks.
[18:32.08]Kill them.
[18:42.59]How many people?
[18:59.04]There's a lot of people in here.
[19:00.70]What was the explosion?
[19:12.42]I heard a fucking explosion.
[19:17.44]Who has- Who has creative mode?
[19:20.00]That shouldn't be a thing.
[19:21.08]Nobody should have TNT.
[19:23.85]Okay, there's like 300 people here.
[19:26.75]Where the fuck are they?
[19:43.66]I'm actually getting kind of nervous.
[19:46.69]Oh my god.
[19:47.57]Okay, somebody just punched me.
[19:54.05]Somebody punched me.
[20:01.70]You know what?
[20:02.40]I'm gonna go into my town.
[20:03.90]You can get whatever the hell you want out here.
[20:06.70]I don't matter.
[20:07.28]Oh, is that Chino?
[20:08.84]Oh, Chino.
[20:17.49]What age am I?
[20:18.27]I'm 31, what age are you?
[20:28.62]I'm two, six, seven, two, I'm two.
[20:32.14]Yeah, maybe eventually some of you plebs, because that's what you actually are.
[20:42.87]I'm gonna go enjoy my fountain.
[20:50.20]Don't let anybody in here.
[20:54.70]If you come inside, you are dead.
[20:58.04]Do not let anyone inside.
[20:59.26]I have things to do.
[21:11.43]Like exist in my throne room.
[21:17.21]What happened to the throne room?
[21:20.36]Why is my throne room flooded?
[21:25.10]I want you to find who did this and I want you to kill them.
[21:29.19]Someone.
[21:38.17]Oh!
[21:46.74]Don't let anyone in the front gates, no matter what.
[22:00.45]I'm age seven, yet I still have mining fatigue, too.
[22:11.60]I think, you know what I'd like to do?
[22:15.76]Is this Colgate Island?
[22:17.12]What?
[22:20.96]I'd like to meet my loyal subjects.
[22:22.61]Let's go explore the town a little bit.
[22:28.79]Come on.
[22:36.98]What's the matter?
[22:38.62]What are you all doing out here?
[22:43.19]Don't you have things to do?
[22:45.33]You need food.
[22:46.77]You need food.
[22:49.59]Join voice chat.
[22:51.26]Why?
[22:51.66]What does that mean?
[22:52.36]Join voice chat.
[23:24.47]Oh, I just went into the voice chat.
[23:27.79]There's screaming.
[23:35.80]I live in the castle.
[23:37.10]No, you don't.
[23:40.40]Somebody said they killed Fortnite guy.
[23:42.64]Hey, excuse me.
[23:49.84]Thank you for that ladder.
[23:52.28]Please, food.
[23:53.06]Go get food!
[23:55.06]Fine!
[23:56.40]Listen, this is the only time you're gonna get a handout like this.
[24:00.24]Fight for it!
[24:04.24]Go get it!
[24:08.36]Don't!
[24:09.22]Don't let them in!
[24:10.46]Get rid of them!
[24:11.64]Get rid of them!
[24:14.10]How dare you!
[24:19.40]I'm starving.
[24:21.46]Well, then make some food!
[24:22.64]I can't be the one that provides everything!
[24:24.39]I didn't anticipate... Somebody came in the server and said, What is this?
[24:41.50]Dude, you're gonna fucking die.
[25:02.21]Are there no animals?
[25:03.47]There should be.
[25:10.45]Someone give me the coordinates of the town.
[25:12.55]I'm lost.
[25:17.15]There is no food.
[25:30.97]Oh my god.
[25:32.47]This is fucking so stupid.
[25:34.23]There's no way no one's gonna kill me.
[25:37.39]I am never going to die.
[25:41.06]No, there's not a chance in hell.
[25:42.70]Even if three, four, five hundred of you work together, no way.
[25:51.31]The guards are too strong.
[25:59.06]My king, I would like to offer my jester services.
[26:03.72]Okay.
[26:04.84]Psychostatic.
[26:07.42]You are dressed like a jester.
[26:08.76]Let's get you in here.
[26:09.54]That'll be fun.
[26:11.40]Psychostatic is allowed inside the king.
[26:23.20]Yes, very, very, very funny.
[26:31.36]Absolutely hilarious!
[26:36.19]Now kill him.
[26:55.95]Why is he still here?
[26:58.98]I gave a specific order to my subordinates.
[27:28.04]Why are my crafts dirty?
[27:29.64]You don't!
[27:30.88]You just pick it up, man!
[27:32.90]You just pick it up!
[27:35.76]Okay, I need to... Oh, ow!
[27:48.97]Hey!
[27:49.31]You have to take a look outside!
[27:52.63]Get out of my way!
[27:54.81]Here, look!

[29:05.89]I need a fishing rod.
[29:07.11]No.
[29:30.56]Everyone thought I was gonna die in five minutes.
[29:38.03]Do I have a fishing rod yet?
[29:45.81]Wait, the guards are in creative mode?
[29:49.12]Get these guards out of creative mode!

[51:00.49]Someone's dropping sand on here.
[51:02.59]Okay.
[51:03.07]Ow, that hurts.
[51:04.23]That hurts.
[51:04.55]Somebody's fucking doing crazy.

[51:45.32]Long live the king.
[51:46.64]That's right.
[51:49.83]Don't dig straight down, my brethren.
[51:54.75]Somebody died from falling.
[51:56.05]I just saw it in the chat.
[52:05.86]I ain't going that way.
[52:06.86]I'm not going to get killed by a creeper.
[52:09.70]Somebody else go.
[52:10.36]Vec, you go first.
[52:11.16]I'm not doing it.
[52:21.22]Do we have any torches?
[52:22.84]I need to eat.
[52:28.73]King Jerma, I come from a faraway land to offer some of my wrestling talent to you.
[52:33.17]You come nearer, you're dead.
[52:43.38]Don't even come within 10 feet of me.
[52:46.18]Okay, at this point now...
[52:48.43]At this point in the game, guards, if anyone comes within five feet of me, kill them.
[52:56.24]Do not let them survive.
[53:01.02]We cannot have an opportunity where somebody comes in with a diamond axe and kills them.
[53:06.23]What's five feet?
[53:07.21]I'll show you.
[53:09.31]This is five feet.
[53:10.19]1.5 blocks.
[53:18.50]Can we open the server back up again for more people to come in?
[53:33.67]Somebody said iPhone mic.
[53:34.83]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[53:38.01]iPhone mic.
[53:39.79]Shit mic.
[53:49.72]People aren't getting kicked when they die.
[53:52.06]Yeah, I know.
[53:52.96]We got a lot of systems we're trying to fix.
[54:01.05]It's a Game Boy mic.
[54:04.89]Why did I get hurt?
[54:05.61]Why are you on fire?
[54:11.26]You alright?
[54:14.46]It's a webcam mic.
[54:15.60]It's not a webcam mic!
[54:29.15]I hear, uh, growling.
[54:32.63]How many people we got in the server now?
[54:48.80]Alright, let's load like another hundred people in.
[54:50.68]Nobody can join, you're only playing with guards.
[54:55.14]That's not true!
[54:55.80]There's like, sick, there's like ten guards!
[55:05.19]I see iron.
[55:06.13]I'm not gonna mine it.
[55:06.95]Somebody else mine it for me.
[55:13.21]Alright, 150 now.
[55:19.21]Give me food.
[55:20.55]No, get your own food!
[55:25.10]Watch that exit here.
[55:33.74]Now, you know what?
[55:35.44]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:36.56]Watch the water.
[55:37.20]Watch the water.
[55:37.72]Watch the water.
[55:40.08]Guards, get out of here.
[55:40.86]This is stupid for us to be doing.
[55:43.98]I would like 50 citizens to dig up the rest of this cave for us, please.
[55:52.91]There will be four stakes on the ground.
[55:56.53]That's a diamond pickaxe.
[55:57.51]Give me that.
[56:01.26]I don't want to do this anymore, this is fucking too long.
[56:03.81]Bring in like 50 people to dig this first.
[56:05.95]Until we find a cool cave and find gold.
[56:07.43]If you take the gold back, you're dead.
[56:20.44]Who is this person?
[56:21.84]You know what?
[56:22.48]I'm killing this person.
[56:23.64]Like, just kill this person.
[56:25.20]Look at how menacing that is.
[56:30.72]Okay, why am I on fire?
[56:31.84]Why am I on fire?
[56:33.08]Why am I on fire?
[56:33.98]Why am I on fire?
[56:34.64]Why am I on fire?
[56:37.98]Stop hitting me!
[56:45.09]Don't- Someone's gonna drop a fucking anvil on us.
[56:47.13]Alright, all the guard- Watch it, watch it, watch out for this Chad guy.
[57:01.16]Don't let him get away.
[57:01.98]Kill him, please.
[57:08.65]PS2 Mike.
[57:17.23]Is the stamina system working?
[57:18.67]I can't see anything.
[57:32.24]Dermot, I can't eat anything.
[57:35.73]That sounds like a you problem.
[57:40.83]Ow, my stomach.
[57:53.57]Wait, people in the castle?
[57:56.58]Since when?
[57:59.57]We have mining fatigue.
[58:03.09]I gotta get to the castle.
[58:10.96]Okay, I need to stop laughing.
[58:13.90]You can only eat cooked food, guys.
[58:16.52]Wait, I need my guards.
[58:17.40]There's people here.
[58:22.04]The castle's getting griefed?
[58:23.40]What?

[58:51.44]Kill him!
[58:52.14]You don't cook bread.
[58:53.36]You just eat it.
[59:07.99]What happened to the throne?
[59:17.98]Alright, if... Let me give you this.
[59:21.02]Citizens of Earth!
[59:23.94]If there is not 100 iron bars given to the front of the castle in 15 minutes,

[59:41.91]Starting now.
[59:48.62]100 iron bars.
[59:50.86]There's like 200 of you here.
[59:55.94]I want it at the front of the castle.
[59:57.12]Nobody pick it up.
[59:58.48]Or I will execute 50 people.
[59:59.62]At random.
[60:04.38]Nobody pick them up.
[60:05.16]Nobody touch them.
[60:07.63]We can't mine.
[60:08.51]We're babies.
[60:18.00]Good luck.
[60:19.14]We can't even eat yet.
[60:23.11]Okay, listen, listen, very important.

[61:04.61]There's twelve people in the server.
[61:06.09]There's like two or three hundred people in the server.
[61:15.74]I don't see any gold, uh, any iron bars up here.
[61:33.32]The whitelist is broken, open it back up!
[61:39.40]Open, open the first server up, let's go!

[62:58.42]Alright, I got an idea.
[63:00.04]I got an idea.
[63:00.58]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, kill him!
[63:03.89]I got an idea.
[63:04.49]I got an idea.
[63:06.13]Age everybody to 15.
[63:07.89]Go.
[63:08.27]Do it.
[63:08.63]Let's go.
[63:29.78]Somebody just died from a skeleton.
[63:32.15]I'm sorry to hear that.
[63:38.81]Please don't steal two years of my life.
[63:41.04]Stealing years of my life, you king.
[63:42.78]I'm dying.
[63:43.32]I'm trapped in a building.
[63:44.76]Jerma, if you're eating this, fuck you.
[63:46.50]Food, please.
[63:47.26]I still have fucking mining fatigue.
[63:49.12]At age 15, you've got mining fatigue.
[63:51.18]15, you heard him.
[63:51.68]I was only three weeks in front of me to be aged.
[64:01.82]Mining fatigue.
[64:10.73]This is how it was back in the day?
[64:23.32]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[64:24.70]Somebody said, mic fatigue.
[64:27.60]Alright, hold on, wait.
[64:28.50]Alright, guards, important guards.
[64:33.41]Protect me, I have to pee.
[64:35.81]Do not let me die, I actually have to go pee.
[64:39.37]Let a shitload of people on the server and fucking put everybody at age 15.
[67:16.38]Where am I?
[67:16.70]Where am I?
[67:21.10]Where the fuck am I?
[67:30.21]You put me in a box?
[67:31.25]Why?
[67:31.51]Alright, well get me out of here.
[67:35.29]How do I get out of here?
[67:35.93]Oh, it's nighttime.
[67:42.24]So why are there people still in front of the castle gates?
[67:51.92]Uh-oh.
[67:54.58]Uh-oh.
[67:54.84]I think the whole thing's dead.
[67:59.32]Yeah, it crashed.
[68:06.23]I have to execute 50 people now.
[68:08.47]We're good.
[68:17.83]Just come back in.
[68:22.80]I want to see some of the cool things that people have done on the outside of the town.
[68:26.76]I'm going for it.
[68:27.44]I'm gonna go look.
[68:34.81]Just whitelist everyone?
[68:36.89]Oh yeah, everything's broken.
[68:38.89]Yeah.
[68:40.09]We... You know what?
[68:42.78]Kill the music.
[68:43.52]Kill the music.
[68:46.84]Let's talk real talk here.
[68:49.10]So the whitelisting server had some API issues.
[68:54.60]So we can't implement that now.
[68:57.00]So what we've done is just said, fuck it, and open the whole thing up.
[69:01.66]And sometimes when you do that, you open up to thousands of connections at the same time.
[69:09.24]I'm still alive, though.
[69:12.94]128 RAM is not enough.
[69:16.00]There's like three servers here.
[69:23.01]You died?
[69:23.47]I did not die before.
[69:24.67]That was not real.
[69:30.89]I just found diamond and now I can't rejoin.
[69:33.57]Fuck!
[69:42.07]I'm a cheater.
[69:43.65]Somebody just punched me.
[69:44.49]I don't know who it was.
[69:51.64]Alright, let's drop the whitelist server again.
[69:54.72]Open up the floodgates for like five minutes or so.
[69:57.67]A couple minutes.
[69:59.53]Get a bunch of people in here, close it up.
[70:05.19]I've been trying to mine wood for ten years so I don't starve to death.
[70:08.57]Please help.
[70:18.40]That's so funny.
[70:20.97]How do I get a shield?
[70:22.19]Alright, I want to go look outside.
[70:27.04]Now that we have... There's a ton of people in here now.
[70:28.64]Alright, you ready?
[70:37.26]I want to go look outside.
[70:38.28]I'm going this way.
[70:44.52]Please follow me, guards.
[70:50.37]I'm going outside the city limits.
[70:53.60]Every time you say open up a server, it goes down.
[70:58.32]It's all good.
[71:00.14]I'm surprised that people are just following.
[71:01.92]I guess they're not old enough to attack me.
[71:12.55]Oh, pog.
[71:13.15]I'm 15 now.
[71:14.15]Good.
[71:15.76]Yeah, I would just make everybody 15 and get rid of the mining fatigue.
[71:19.20]I heard an explosion somehow.
[71:26.17]I don't know what that was.
[71:27.01]Alright, we're almost outside the... Did anybody have anything interesting out here that I can see?
[71:43.41]Somebody has.
[71:48.04]crafting table and a furnace nobody can do anything alright get him get him please get him don't let him do that alright most people are 15 now you shouldn't have mining fatigue anymore
[72:16.77]Where's all the cool stuff in my kingdom?
[72:21.92]I'm too funny face.
[72:25.04]What is this?
[72:25.58]This is cool.
[72:30.31]How did you make this out of fucking fences?
[72:32.23]Let's break it.
[72:34.67]What does it take you like five years to make?
[72:42.73]Alright, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
[72:44.09]Don't break it.
[72:44.65]That's not nice.
[72:46.09]That's mean.
[72:46.73]That's mean.
[72:47.27]Let's keep moving.
[72:50.35]Here comes the heel turn.
[72:52.67]Oh, look, somebody has a house out here.
[72:55.53]This is what I'm talking about.
[72:56.53]Watch out for that creeper.
[72:57.41]Kill that.
[73:02.05]Whose house is this?
[73:04.03]What's it say?
[73:05.25]Noodle's communal house.
[73:06.52]No rebels here.
[73:09.12]Just doing a quick inspection to make sure nothing is out of the ordinary.
[73:12.57]What do you have in here?
[73:14.01]I'll take those trees and your, take that too.
[73:20.21]Okay.
[73:22.07]That's a nice little house you have there.
[73:24.71]Taxes?
[73:25.27]No, not yet.
[73:31.96]One house.
[73:35.46]Taxation equals theft.
[73:37.58]Taxation equals theft.
[73:41.22]How many players we got in the server?
[73:54.23]Can we open it up again?
[73:56.91]I would open it up again, try to get to 200 and just get rid of all the limitations.
[74:02.51]Why is there an Enderman in here?
[74:03.91]Why is there an Enderman?
[74:05.37]Why is there an Enderman?
[74:06.65]There's an Enderman in the server.
[74:11.87]I don't think that's supposed to be here.
[74:21.08]Maybe for a second.
[74:23.74]Maybe bring in like 50 more people, 100 more people, maybe.
[74:29.73]Why are you telling people to be creative when you'll ruin their creations?
[74:32.31]I didn't ruin anything.
[74:33.17]I just deleted a couple blocks.
[74:40.11]Nothing else over here.
[74:44.93]We opened it up.
[74:47.93]Oh, shit.
[74:48.87]Somebody wrote, I'm in.
[74:51.67]Can anyone else not break blocks?
[74:55.25]When you get in the server, we're going to open it up so you don't have to worry about being a baby anymore.
[75:02.19]What is this?
[75:04.53]Why is this here?
[75:07.34]Cut this down.
[75:07.88]I don't like that.
[75:18.88]There's 150, almost 200 people here.
[75:20.62]I'm trying to see if we can see anything.
[75:23.84]I want to go check out the community.
[75:37.48]Yeah, you guys have been babies for so long.
[75:39.06]Everyone's been a baby.
[75:45.36]Wait, does that mean that I've been killing babies?
[75:48.88]Is that what that means?
[75:54.27]Oh, shit.
[75:54.85]I've been killing actual babies this whole time.
[75:59.41]So the guy that was Chad striding, he was a baby.
[76:03.27]Yes, I'm a monster.
[76:05.02]I'm not, though.
[76:09.77]Well, what are you doing?
[76:11.18]If you're a baby, why would you walk into the front door?
[76:21.85]Why would you come into the front door of the tower?
[76:23.87]You're dead.
[76:26.17]Because he's a baby, he didn't know.
[76:27.63]Yes, they did.
[76:38.63]Babies don't know.
[76:39.69]Yes, they do.
[76:41.13]Babies don't have logic.
[76:42.26]No, they just can't mine blocks.
[76:50.46]People are killing each other.
[76:53.75]Alright, we've got to be careful.
[76:55.11]We shouldn't roam too far.
[77:05.53]King Jerma, I'm starving three-year-old.
[77:07.87]Help me, please.
[77:09.45]Okay.
[77:11.37]Yeah.
[77:12.89]I'll help you.
[77:14.35]Where are you?
[77:16.29]I'm a man of the people.
[77:17.33]Where are you?
[77:19.29]Jerma, please.
[77:19.99]Food.
[77:20.41]Food.
[77:21.45]I'll help you.
[77:22.25]What is this?
[77:23.76]What is that thing?
[77:26.14]What the hell was that?
[77:27.68]What the fuck was that?
[77:33.32]What was that?
[77:35.21]I'm lost, scared, please guide me.
[77:37.39]I don't know where I am.
[77:38.39]Alright, let's go back.
[77:48.03]I'm starving.
[77:50.03]Well, go get food.
[77:52.45]You have the whole Outer Bounds to look through.
[77:59.82]There's food everywhere.
[78:03.07]Please feed us.
[78:03.73]You're my king.
[78:04.45]Please feed us.
[78:05.11]People are starving.
[78:05.97]I don't think that's a... You should... Where are the animals?
[78:12.19]I have a pig in front of me right now!
[78:13.63]I have three pigs in front of me.
[78:16.51]Alright, can one of the guards please show me back to the castle?
[78:21.71]I have no idea where the fuck we are.
[78:28.03]And can we get the music back on too so I can fucking jam?
[78:39.77]That was a little scuffed.
[78:42.59]Ooh!
[78:47.88]Little town.
[78:49.50]It's a quiet little village.
[78:52.90]Every day like the one before.
[78:54.44]It's so full of people here.
[79:02.97]So many things to see.
[79:05.91]So many people to talk to.
[79:12.84]It's my kingdom.
[79:23.47]Oh, bonjour.
[79:24.57]Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour.
[79:27.77]There goes the baker with his tray of groceries.
[79:31.62]The only person following the guards and me.
[79:34.76]Every morning it's the same.
[79:36.32]The server can't handle more than a hundred people and there's no way we can do the game we wanted.
[79:42.61]Is that Belle?
[79:43.41]No, it's not Belle.
[79:44.25]It's another person, Gerber.
[79:54.63]Lots of groceries.
[79:57.91]I can't wait to... Where is the fucking capital?
[80:02.09]Where's the capital?
[80:03.64]I don't know where we are.
[80:05.90]I have bread in my... What does that mean?
[80:08.76]Someone's punching me.
[80:11.74]Where's the capital?
[80:13.72]I don't know where we are.
[80:19.44]This way?
[80:19.86]Alright, alright.
[80:22.10]We saw one house.
[80:23.06]Good.
[80:30.18]Don't die falling down.
[80:34.34]Someone's fucking punching me.
[80:46.78]Is this the server?
[80:49.00]Am I in the right one?
[80:53.62]I can't, man.
[80:54.46]This is fucking so... Watch these people.
[80:59.47]Where's all the wheat?
[81:04.75]Where's all my stuff?
[81:15.76]All the crops are gone.
[81:18.04]My lord, there's no food in here.
[81:22.76]People are trying to plant new food.
[81:26.71]People are desperately trying to replace the food.
[81:50.75]I think I'm gonna starve.
[82:16.96]Timon, please sign my loaf of bread.
[82:22.26]Okay, hold on.
[82:24.34]How many people are on the server now?
[82:49.03]Nobody can kill me because nobody can eat me.
[82:52.03]Everyone's starving to death.
[82:54.71]There was a whole huge wheat farm right there and it's gone.
[82:59.29]It's empty.
[83:00.97]It's fucking empty.
[83:03.55]People are desperately planting new crops and I'm walking around and nobody can even join.
[83:16.88]Oh my god, my fucking stomach hurts.
[83:23.30]It's my kingdom too- Alright, okay.
[83:25.42]I'm gonna plant some seeds.
[83:29.05]Isn't everybody still alive?
[83:30.19]What do you mean there's people in the throne room doing things to my throne?
[83:42.80]Guards with me, please.
[83:50.62]Get out of my way.
[83:51.38]What do you mean there's people doing things on my throne?
[83:57.79]What does that mean?
[83:58.89]The castle is full of skeletons.
[84:00.67]No, it's not.
[84:04.25]Get in there.
[84:07.84]Oh, my fucking chest.
[84:11.28]The second I saw the person with the, like, one wall built of their house...
[84:23.98]Somebody had like one wall of wood and that was their house.
[84:29.56]What's wrong?
[84:36.20]Okay.
[84:36.91]What?
[84:39.25]Help me!
[84:39.61]Help!
[84:39.83]Help!
[84:40.03]Help!
[84:40.41]Help!
[84:40.77]Help!
[84:41.11]Help!
[84:41.43]Help!
[84:42.39]Help me!
[84:46.67]I need light!
[84:47.13]We need light!
[84:47.79]Chad!
[84:48.37]Chad!
[84:48.67]Put light down here.
[84:49.43]We need light!
[84:51.55]We need light!
[84:58.45]Uh, someone's sleeping in my bed?
[84:59.96]They're dead.
[85:01.02]Whoever's in my bed is fucking dead.
[85:02.74]You're gonna sleep in the king's bed, for Christ's sake?
[85:31.67]Get out of my bed!
[85:35.54]How dare you.
[85:36.70]I'm going to sleep.
[85:46.54]Watch out, watch out, watch out, he's trying to kill me.
[85:49.25]Hey, you got any torches?
[86:04.28]Air for sale?
[86:05.46]You can't sell air in my kingdom, guys.
[86:07.64]Give me a bottle.
[86:08.18]I'm gonna start sniping people.
[86:09.47]Fuck it.
[86:09.81]Let's go.
[86:18.81]Don't you fucking... Seriously?
[86:21.11]Who did that?
[86:25.72]Really?
[86:30.64]Get away from me.
[86:31.32]Get away from me.
[86:31.78]Don't come near me.
[86:33.10]Don't come near me.
[86:33.84]Don't come near me.
[86:34.58]Don't come near me.
[86:37.06]Don't come near me.
[86:41.43]The baby... This is the baby rush?
[86:44.03]The babies have just been sitting in the bed.
[86:48.45]Jerma, my sire, you need a queen.
[86:50.06]Allow me to service you.
[86:52.46]Who's that?
[87:03.62]I'm sitting on the throne.
[87:04.66]I'm almost 50 years old, guys.
[87:11.14]I'm not going to say that out loud.
[87:13.40]I don't know what that is.
[87:15.26]I will suck you for bread.
[87:28.02]Get them away from my throne.
[87:29.22]I don't want them even near me.
[87:36.16]Get out of here, you disgusting peasants!
[87:54.15]Cad the Brave, V.R.
[87:55.87]Josh the Virtual, and the person that just showed the escape route, Will Sarcasm,
[88:04.32]The comedy comedian.
[88:06.32]I'd like for you to go out and find the pub inside of the kingdom.
[88:11.76]Go find the kingdom and take yourselves out of creative mode.
[88:17.26]I want to know more about this pub and I'd like to know if it's kosher.
[88:31.81]Request.
[88:33.22]Go on and find this pub that's been created.
[88:35.54]I've heard a pub has been created in my name.
[88:38.57]I'd like to maybe have a drink there.
[88:49.79]I'm dying, please.
[88:51.13]You'll figure it out.
[88:53.08]Scum.
[89:05.20]What was that?
[89:08.08]Watch the back entrance, make sure no one can get in the back.
[89:12.16]Someone took my bed.
[89:14.86]Get, Greg from Nvidia, get out of the castle or you will die in 10 seconds.
[89:20.20]Two, nine, hey Morty, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, okay, they're okay.
[89:33.31]They're okay.
[89:37.20]RDM, RDM admin, he killed me.
[89:39.20]Good luck.
[89:43.88]No, nobody liked that one.
[89:50.83]A nice bed that doesn't exist anymore.
[89:55.71]Oh, somebody took it.
[89:56.79]Somebody stole the bed.
[89:59.25]Now that's just interesting.
[90:03.43]Okay.
[90:05.59]Are they trying to... Did they find a way behind?
[90:09.17]What is this?
[90:10.35]Can we get some light in here?
[90:13.97]What is this?
[90:16.87]Secret little hiding room?
[90:19.79]Get the fuck out of here.
[90:20.71]There's like diamonds back here.
[90:25.07]How do I hold the torch out?
[90:31.63]What the fuck is going on over here?
[90:34.83]I didn't make this.
[90:36.11]Investigate this, please.
[90:38.50]Someone was trying to kill me when I lied down to go to sleep.
[90:40.80]I need to eat food!
[90:43.70]The king has not eaten in like two days.
[90:48.34]And watch this!
[90:49.16]This is kind of bull- this is ridiculous.
[90:52.22]Somebody got in here and made this.
[90:59.62]Who made that?
[91:01.66]I need food.
[91:02.48]Oh, no.
[91:02.72]I got it.
[91:03.10]I got it.
[91:03.44]I got it.
[91:08.15]Food.
[91:08.79]Well, let me just tell you guys something.
[91:11.03]If you're going to go for an assassination attempt, don't remove the bed.
[91:19.27]Don't get rid of the bed.
[91:20.29]That's like a giveaway.
[91:21.17]Why would you take the bed?
[91:29.49]Sorry, we have found the pub.
[91:31.72]What's in the pub?
[91:33.40]Where is it?
[91:37.20]I'd like to go have a drink at this pub.
[91:43.11]Okay, let's go.
[91:43.97]Somebody lead me to the pub.
[91:45.13]I'd like to have a drink at this new pub.
[91:51.77]Watch out.
[91:52.21]Watch out.
[91:52.83]Watch out.
[91:53.19]Watch out.
[91:53.55]Watch out.
[91:53.87]Watch out.
[91:54.21]Please help me.
[91:56.75]Somebody just rushed.
[91:59.88]Fuck them.
[92:10.65]Hold on, I need a sword.

[112:30.24]Mr. Comcast.
[112:35.80]This is the wrong guy.
[112:36.86]No, it's not.

[112:40.50]I'm almost as old as Jerma.
[112:43.54]Nice booster seat is what John Comcast says.
[112:46.95]Well, that just confirms that I have made a sentencing.
[112:52.47]for you to die.
[112:54.45]How do you think about that, John Comcast?
[112:56.63]I said your name wrong.
[112:57.36]Don't kill him yet.
[112:58.04]I want to hear what he has to say.
[113:03.12]I'm on a booster seat.
[113:04.16]Isn't that funny?

[114:44.75]Oh.
[114:44.91]Screen Freak, how do you plead?
[114:46.17]You killed somebody that made a sign that said Jerma985 is tiny and you killed them.
[114:50.46]Are you trying to act up on the King's wishes or was that for... It was a display of loyalty.
[114:58.54]I'm not guilty.
[114:59.72]Interesting.
[115:01.26]Display of loyalty.

[132:29.69]They went and got 60 bread to take back to the community and fucking build another pub.
[132:33.37]Who cares?
[132:33.87]I think the server crashed.
[132:43.97]Server's dead.
[132:47.48]O, O, F, exclamation point.
[132:51.48]Big F on the... Ooh, there we are.

[133:26.77]I'm only wearing pants?
[133:28.01]I know!
[133:28.35]I think we lost everybody.
[133:37.10]I'm disappointed, Dermot.
[133:38.02]You're feeding your Napoleon complex by just cheating in a five-year-old game.
[133:43.02]You could... You could have embraced your inner Jax and... But your and your team of corrupt mods have ruined it.
[133:54.95]Okay, fine.
[133:55.45]Fuck it.
[133:55.75]Uh, all guards take off your armor, please.
[134:00.29]Wanna see how much I give a shit about that?
[134:01.63]Take off your- All guards take your- Okay.
[134:10.41]Fine.
[134:12.63]Stop the trial.
[134:13.27]John Comcast is innocent.
[134:23.12]It was Jonas Bones was the real culprit.
[134:26.43]Okay.
[134:27.83]He has returned.
[134:29.37]Well, get him and John Comcast in a trial by combat.
[134:32.73]Let them kill each other.
[134:39.25]Get them inside of that circle.
[134:41.94]Jonas Bones and John Comcast.
[134:43.58]Lawyer versus client.
[134:49.08]John Comcast did nothing wrong.
[134:50.72]I don't...
[134:53.34]Do you think I care?
[134:56.30]He came to your defense.
[134:58.37]And now you're gonna have to come to your own defense.
[135:00.79]Against his blade.
[135:01.65]Good luck.
[135:08.49]Alright, are we ready?
[135:14.67]Jonas Bonus versus John Comcast in the trial by... Snack on me.
[135:27.09]Alright, let's start it up.
[135:28.37]Trial by combat.
[135:29.41]Can we get some appropriate music for this, please?
[135:40.02]John Comcast, you don't scare, you don't stand accused of anything.
[135:42.90]Jonah's made the, his tiny thing.
[135:45.84]So you should just be banned forever and like, fuck you.
[135:48.32]But we're going to have you fight John Comcast to discern if you're going to stay in the server permanently or not.
[135:59.24]Cereal box microphone is really taking off.
[136:02.92]When I say go, I would like for you to attack each other.
[136:07.89]Jonas, bonus.
[136:09.39]Good luck.
[136:10.15]John Comcast, you're absolutely innocent, but you're just here for some reason.
[136:15.09]Good.
[136:15.23]Get away from me.
[136:19.02]Three, two, one.
[136:21.52]Commence the battle for my amusement.
[136:27.00]Oh, it was...
[136:33.31]One hit.
[136:35.13]You did a great job.
[136:40.22]John Cobcast is the victor of the battle.
[136:44.53]He and Wumsley...
[136:57.45]John Comcast, congratulations.
[137:00.75]Congratulations.
[137:01.31]Absolutely fantastic.
[137:04.93]Let me in here.
[137:06.79]John Comcast, I'd like to present to you what you have won as a victory prize.
[137:12.52]You've won a full year's supply of bread.
[137:19.28]And Comcast killed the server at the exact moment that he died.
[137:23.74]F in the chat.
[137:32.47]Oh, my stomach fucking hurts, man.
[137:38.71]This is so fucking ridiculous.
[137:42.96]Who would have thought that having thousands of people connect to the same place was a bad idea?
[137:48.16]John Comcast, correct.
[137:49.90]You have won.
[137:54.54]Where's John Comcast?
[137:57.52]Are they back in the server?
[138:04.69]Jeremy, you're feeding your Garfield complex by just cheating a Garfield year-old game.
[138:09.29]You could have embraced your inner Garfield and rose to the Garfield.
[138:12.63]What are you talking about?
[138:17.09]John Comcast, congratulations.
[138:20.95]Please take this supply of food forever.
[138:26.76]John Comcast is with us again.
[138:30.34]I would like to go in the box of John Comcast.
[138:34.20]What the fuck just happened?
[138:38.04]Gargoyle is dead.
[138:39.98]John Comcast, please take your at least 10 year supply of food.
[138:47.43]And your 35 gold bars.
[138:48.79]Congratulations.
[138:55.57]Nice work.
[139:01.74]Okay.
[139:02.60]Now fuck off.
[139:03.72]Before I change my mind.
[139:04.60]Alright, it's time.
[139:12.53]I'm 81 years old.
[139:13.51]It's time for the mods to take their armor off.
[139:16.27]And replace it with leather armor.
[139:19.83]This is a Stadia server.
[139:21.29]Get outta here.
[139:30.49]All king's guards take all of their armor off.
[139:42.28]Why did you kill him?
[139:44.72]There was no reason for him to die.
[139:48.16]He was in gold armor.
[139:49.40]How did he die?
[139:50.14]Why is there an ear of corn over here?
[139:56.87]Help me, help me, please, help me.
[139:58.95]Somebody in the box, jumped in the box, tried to kill me.
[140:03.54]Alright, I'm out.
[140:04.44]Get me out, seriously.
[140:06.80]Protect me, seriously, seriously.
[140:08.00]Help me, help me, help me, help me.
[140:08.86]Alright, I'm going back in the throne room.
[140:14.55]Fuck this, they're revolting.
[140:15.87]I'm out.
[140:19.93]I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[140:20.77]I'm going to the throne.
[140:25.69]Oh, fuck, people are dead.
[140:29.86]Oh my fucking God.
[140:31.04]They're chasing me.
[140:31.98]I need people to follow me up to the bedroom.
[140:34.78]Uh, how long have you been streaming for?
[140:36.20]It's been two hours.
[140:41.04]Holy fuck.
[140:42.44]Wait, somebody, somebody's in my bedroom.
[140:44.78]Somebody's in my, I gotta get up.

[143:46.18]He fell for the Sky Town ruse.
[143:50.35]Is that for real?
[143:55.98]It's part of the Farmer's Guild.
[143:59.40]Where is that?
[144:03.18]No one made anything to remember they were killed by your guards.
[144:23.51]Somebody tried to put something together, but it didn't work.
[144:34.09]Let me finish it.
[144:37.85]This is my statue.
[144:42.86]Oh my God.

[155:35.98]The crop is so fucked.
[155:43.72]There was a lot of wheat there and it's now empty.
[155:46.80]I'm 96.
[155:47.31]I'm almost dead.
[155:51.14]Where?

[156:25.94]I'm fucking a hundred.
[156:35.10]I died a long, painful death.
[156:39.20]Cheater.
[156:43.78]I have a half a heart.
[156:44.98]I'm fucked.
[156:54.08]yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I was cheating no I was not rebels be like fort fork runner no killing no stealing no rebels long right 10 000 years

[157:43.80]I have no- I don't know where I am.
[157:55.42]Where am I now?
[157:57.14]People have pens of animals already?
[158:01.29]I'm dead.
[158:02.81]I died.
[158:04.61]How the fuck did you make all this in two hours?
[158:08.87]Two hours!
[158:09.78]Two hours!
[158:23.88]you could actually get all this done in this one time.
[158:29.48]Nice work, holy shit.
[158:39.57]That's very little for two- well, considering how many times the server crashed.
[158:42.31]Let me see what else you got down here.
[158:50.54]We're starving in quotes.
[158:52.02]Yeah, not really.
[158:55.34]I want to see what's down here.
[158:59.80]What the fuck?
[159:01.72]Quarry for Cobble.
[159:04.94]You guys have been busy.
[159:08.98]All the bullshit we were doing in the castle.
[159:13.70]You guys were playing Minecraft over here the whole time.
[159:16.28]Wow.
[159:21.03]Seriously, nice work.
[159:29.27]Am I going to open up a server?
[159:30.35]Well, we're going to pull the data from... And first of all, the whitelist didn't work.
[159:37.29]So that's another thing.
[159:38.11]There was no whitelist.
[159:39.57]This goes down really fucking far.
[159:43.55]We did this today to make sure that we got info of people connecting to the server.
[159:51.36]We're going to save it the way it is.
[159:53.70]And we're going to do this again.
[159:55.66]Don't tell anybody there's anything down here.
[159:56.98]But look what's down here.
[160:04.28]There was only one way we could test anything that was doing it.
[160:08.08]That's the only way.
[160:11.03]This is huge, by the way.
[160:20.78]Breaking with bread.
[160:25.42]So this was actually probably the real versus yesterday and the day before.
[160:36.57]So what was our max amount of people in the server?
[160:41.81]200?
[160:41.83]400?
[160:42.01]300?
[160:42.03]200 something?
[160:53.82]So now we know for next time what we can do.
[160:55.54]Uh, yeah, just take people out.
[161:05.48]Discord, Mike.
[161:10.59]It should be 2,000.
[161:12.15]Well, that's a lot harder than it looks.
[161:13.73]Because getting even 200 or 300 people in the same server is insane.
[161:24.92]108?
[161:24.94]Somebody just kill him.
[161:25.72]Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[161:33.72]Just play RuneScape instead.
[161:47.85]I'm jumping off a building.
[162:00.02]The sun sets.
[162:01.04]What a beautiful... What?
[162:07.13]Well, some of you did a great community here.
[162:08.77]Some of us died, and the server crashed like 10 times.
[162:13.59]So we got what we needed for data.
[162:17.88]Thanks for participating, because this is probably what we're going to call it.
[162:23.16]So if we do this again, we're going to make sure that we have the whitelisting in place next time.
[162:28.70]We were like 10 minutes away from But I was like, no, fuck it.
[162:33.15]Let's just do it.
[162:33.61]Who cares?
[162:33.89]I didn't even give a shit.
[162:46.95]How did a spider get in the kingdom?
[162:51.29]Somebody found... Yeah, I think we learned a lot from this stream, so that's good.
[163:04.90]So, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[163:10.38]We're gonna we're gonna pull as much as we can from this and try to make see this that's like another stress test essentially The microphone
[163:37.32]Did I name the kingdom?
[163:38.22]I didn't even name the kingdom.
[163:39.26]It's called... No, yeah, I did.
[163:46.06]We're gonna save everything that's here now.
[163:50.05]And next time we're gonna try a couple different things.
[163:53.81]I wanna do this at least one more time.
[163:55.23]And then hopefully we can have the actual stuff that we're creating.
[164:03.27]Why am I getting attacked by... Stop attacking me!
[164:05.43]What's going on?
[164:08.94]Prove it's not creative.
[164:10.60]I'm dying right now.
[164:12.08]I'm being literally killed right now.
[164:14.16]I'm dead.
[164:17.30]Don't cheat.
[164:18.02]I'm not cheating.
[164:26.86]Next time, no cheating.
[164:34.50]I get to still be 108 years old, but...
[164:39.66]You still owe me for crashing my jetpack in GTA Castle.
[164:43.14]Oh, the server's dead.
[164:48.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[164:50.08]That'll be it for tonight.
[164:54.02]Those of you that got to participate, we were minutes away from canceling the stream.
[164:59.96]But thanks for stress testing this and putting this in a position where we can figure out things we can do to put in place to make it a little bit better.
[165:14.29]Yeah.
[165:14.55]If you want to, here's the people that are literally sitting, trying to, uh, make this whole thing work.
[165:23.85]I had fun at least for the first couple hours.
[165:33.46]Let's see if we can get some more bugs ironed out and let's try this.
[165:37.47]But I'll see you guys tomorrow, tomorrow afternoon.
[165:43.51]Thanks for participating in the experiment and the stress test.
[165:48.83]We'll see what we can do with it next week.
[165:53.35]Kick some mic tomorrow.
[165:54.79]Don't worry.
[165:55.23]The mic's going to be back to normal.
[165:56.17]Good night, guys.
[166:00.59]Thank you again.
[166:02.13]Sorry for the late start.
[166:05.54]See you tomorrow.
[166:12.42]The bits and the subs, I will do those tomorrow because I'm not... So I don't have access to the information, right?
[166:18.94]We'll go with the bits and subs tomorrow.
[166:21.70]Tomorrow after the stream, probably.
[166:24.48]I am not currently live from my own home.
[166:27.90]We're at a mobile studio right now.
[166:37.05]Nerf the guards?
[166:37.85]Yeah.
[166:40.77]I told you we were gonna have to do, like, a test of this to see how it worked out.
[166:46.08]I still had fun.
[166:46.68]I thought it was fucking funny.
[166:50.42]The mod should wear chainmail.
[166:52.00]Yeah.
[166:53.22]We'll do that next time.
[166:56.08]Good night, though.
[166:56.56]We'll see you tomorrow.
[166:58.68]Thanks for participating.
[166:59.93]See you soon.
[167:01.15]Take care, guys.
