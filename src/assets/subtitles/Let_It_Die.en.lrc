[ve:60.16.100]

[00:31.69]You think I was gonna be you know the dick that was gonna be late that I was gonna be like seven minutes late
[01:05.66]And that's why I've seen so many people in this guy.
[01:13.22]You're going to come to my stream and you're going to talk.
[01:22.29]Hi, guys.
[01:26.91]As eight minutes late.
[01:27.64]Yeah, whatever.
[01:28.10]It's fine.
[01:32.76]I was cutting out.
[01:33.48]Oh, shit.
[01:33.84]I said a lot of really, really important stuff.
[01:40.19]No, that was an on-purpose mic cutting.
[01:42.27]Come on, guys.
[01:43.37]Don't you know me better by now?
[01:44.27]We're going to probably let it die tonight.
[01:51.71]It's a Souls-like game.
[01:52.93]If you can categorize it as that.
[01:55.77]Not very many people are talking about this game.
[01:59.53]Or playing it, for that matter.
[02:03.49]Every time I go on to Twitch and I'm like, oh, the game came out like last week.
[02:07.43]Nobody seems to care.
[02:10.23]I didn't even know about this until people in my chat were talking about it.
[02:16.68]So we're going to try it.
[02:17.48]I mean, who knows?
[02:18.08]It's got kind of shaky reviews, but it's by a grasshopper manufacturer.
[02:26.48]So if you play No More Heroes and other games that Suda51... I don't think Suda51 had anything to do with this game, though.
[02:37.93]But that company made this game.
[02:41.93]Regardless, we're going to give it a try.
[02:45.63]I bought some in-game currency.
[02:49.61]So, we have something to play with in case you actually really need it.
[02:56.40]Did I voice a character in this?
[02:57.76]No.
[03:00.56]I did not voice a character in this game.
[03:06.42]Pay to win?
[03:07.79]I don't know.
[03:08.83]I dropped like 13 bucks.
[03:16.88]I spent $13 on this game.
[03:19.16]Because I don't want to get to a situation where... You know, like I die and you have to pay money to live.
[03:26.09]And I'm just like, well, stream's over.
[03:28.55]So I figured I'd at least pay a little bit of money.
[03:31.93]Disclose?
[03:32.99]I have nothing to do with this shit.
[03:35.85]I don't have anything to do with anything, ever.
[03:40.36]Yeah, let me disclose to you guys that I spent $13 on a free-to-play game.
[03:43.76]That's the disclosure there.
[03:47.07]Am I going to act stupid today?
[03:49.77]I don't act stupid any day.
[03:53.71]I think you just think I'm stupid.
[03:56.38]And everyone has a right to their opinion.
[03:58.28]And you have one.
[04:02.66]Did you think I would forget that promise for beatboxing?
[04:07.64]I'm gonna, like, give you, like, a personal beatbox.
[04:09.62]I'm gonna, like, fucking PM it to you.
[04:11.82]I don't have... I lost my mojo and my confidence in doing stuff like that, like beatboxing.
[04:16.08]I haven't, like, practiced.
[04:17.04]I don't, like, do it anymore.
[04:21.89]But I just made a tweet.
[04:22.87]We're gonna wait for a second, and then we're gonna go.
[04:24.85]The game's probably gonna be really, really fucking loud.
[04:30.96]So be prepared for extremely loud noises when I change over here, which is going to happen right now.
[04:40.63]I wonder how loud of a noise we're going to get.
[04:46.23]And there we go.
[04:47.01]Okay.
[04:48.69]So this game is not supposed to be taken that seriously, I guess.
[04:50.84]It's very jokey, but it's like a Souls-like.
[04:55.22]And before we get started, thank you, by the way, Sam, for the 200 bits.
[05:00.68]Cornstalkhand77 for six months.
[05:02.31]Thanks a lot.
[05:02.75]TheManOfStraw for three months.
[05:04.67]When am I going to play FistfulOfFrags?
[05:07.49]How much money do you need to give me for me to play FistfulOfFrags?
[05:12.73]No amount of money is going to make me play FistfulOfFrags.
[05:15.13]I'm going to play FistfulOfFrags when I decide I want to play it again, if I ever do.
[05:23.81]No jokes.
[05:24.25]It's a serious game.
[05:26.07]But thank you for the subscription, dude.
[05:30.39]And then people subbed when I was offline earlier, so thank you to those people.
[05:34.36]My Serious Face, Official Syrah, FateUX, and I Hate Generic Cereal.
[05:41.68]Thank you for your subscriptions off stream.
[05:46.00]And yeah, let's get rolling.
[05:49.68]What do you say?
[05:51.81]Prepare for how loud this is going to be.
[05:53.85]I'm just going to give you that warning right now.
[05:55.51]Loud game.
[05:57.69]Loud fucking game.
[05:58.83]Here it comes.
[06:00.96]Until I can go in the options.
[06:02.00]I like came in just to like see if it ran at like 60 FPS or not.
[06:06.32]But I didn't do any audio adjustments.
[06:07.86]So prepare yourselves.
[06:09.90]Because I think there's a cutscene coming right now.
[06:12.04]Prepare.
[06:16.32]In the year 2026 AD, the Earth Rage tectonic disturbance occurred around the world, splitting the Earth into four terrestrial masses.
[06:27.82]Domination, war, disaster and famine broke out in the four lands and mankind fell into disarray.
[06:38.47]In the center of the world, a single tower rose steeply into the sky.
[06:43.81]It was a great structure looking down upon the Earth from the heavens above.
[06:49.23]People believed that it held the key to the future.
[06:53.39]It became known as the Tower of Bonds.
[06:55.49]That is Mark Hamill.
[06:56.87]A place at which one could come closest to God.
[07:03.97]That is Mark Hamill, isn't it?
[07:05.45]Oh, shit.
[07:06.75]That's cool.
[07:15.32]Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da.
[07:33.70]That's the coolest bike.
[07:46.23]That bike has a face on it.
[08:00.86]What?
[08:01.66]Another new arrival.
[08:04.39]Looks like things are about to get busy around here.
[08:07.45]Alright.
[08:12.01]Death on a skateboard, though.
[08:13.67]That's pretty cool.
[08:34.23]Good female actors.
[08:37.19]Ah, it's still so loud.
[08:38.31]I gotta turn it down a second, I'm able to.
[08:39.87]Select fighter.
[08:47.40]Okay.
[08:48.16]Good male.
[08:51.24]Is there like a John Kerry?
[08:57.99]I don't think this is John Kerry.
[08:59.69]That's the closest to John Kerry we're gonna get.
[09:11.06]What the hell is this?
[09:11.78]This is, uh, Let It Die.
[09:13.78]It's a free-to-play Souls-like game that came out last week and nobody's fucking talking about it.
[09:18.30]I don't know why.
[09:23.10]The game might just suck.
[09:24.38]Maybe that's why.
[09:25.12]We're gonna find out.
[09:35.22]Senpai!
[09:37.00]I was waiting for you.
[09:38.78]This is your first time riding Line 15, huh?
[09:41.70]I know, it's not a very well-known lie, I admit.
[09:44.92]Anyway, this is the last stop.
[09:48.73]Okay.
[09:55.05]Alright, that's a punch.
[09:57.70]Left handed and right handed punches?
[09:59.52]The naked guy?
[10:03.44]Alright, what do we do?
[10:09.27]I can't talk to that guy.
[10:10.19]There's like a dodge roll.
[10:12.41]There's a jump.
[10:12.95]Alright, well.
[10:19.80]Oh, yeah.
[10:20.66]Here, take this.
[10:22.34]It's called an underwater rolodex.
[10:24.83]And it's super important.
[10:30.89]I forgot to mention.
[10:31.71]I thought he was going to sing.
[10:32.91]Yes, Uncle Death.
[10:35.68]I have a feeling we're going to get along just fine.
[10:40.26]Uncle Death.
[10:41.52]No.
[10:45.52]No.
[10:53.12]Alright.
[10:53.46]Give me a second here.
[10:54.30]I want to... Oh, there he is up there.
[10:55.72]Config.
[10:59.04]Let's see.
[10:59.56]Music.
[11:01.00]Effects.
[11:02.70]Let's just turn this shit a little bit down so we can hear ourselves think.
[11:09.00]That would be a plus.
[11:10.04]What do you think?
[11:12.22]That's probably a little bit better.
[11:17.28]Confirm it.
[11:17.84]Alright.
[11:19.96]I don't know what any of this means.
[11:21.06]We're just going to keep going.
[11:23.22]Is that better?
[11:24.16]That sounds like it's better.
[11:30.10]I guess when your heart beats like that, it means you're out of stamina.
[11:36.44]Alright.
[11:40.06]That's a broken hand.
[11:50.10]Well, there's only one other way to go.
[11:54.56]The game's unreal.
[11:55.28]I don't see the paper in his underwear.
[12:00.24]What does that mean?
[12:04.44]Thank you, Soundof and GurkPro for your subscriptions.
[12:07.20]Welcome, guys.
[12:12.62]I was doing all bare hands, an unarmed build.
[12:15.13]Is that what we're doing?
[12:20.68]Is the stream kind of jerky?
[12:21.90]I think right now it's loading.
[12:24.54]When it loads, it kind of freezes up for a second.
[12:26.71]Is it, though?
[12:27.59]Let me know if it is.
[12:31.11]Is the game, looks like it's running badly or something?
[12:33.73]Because it's pretty smooth, right?
[12:36.65]He's coming out of the PS4 controller.
[12:40.27]Oh, God.
[12:44.87]Yeah.
[12:48.25]Is it... You let me know, because I don't want to... I want to fix it if it's happening.
[12:53.49]Is it smooth right now?
[12:55.01]Should be.
[12:58.10]He talked through the fucking phone.
[13:00.90]Looks fine to me.
[13:01.66]Alright, let's take... There's a balloon here.
[13:10.02]Alright, left-hand attack.
[13:11.76]Hey, by the way, fuck the tutorial.
[13:14.81]Here's every control in the game.
[13:16.33]Let's take a look.
[13:22.66]Left-hand attack or aim two-handed gun.
[13:26.49]That's options.
[13:27.17]Right-hand attack.
[13:28.13]Jump.
[13:28.65]Guard.
[13:29.71]Dodge.
[13:30.17]Okay, so you can hold that and that's guard.
[13:32.73]And that's that way any, you know, direction is dodge.
[13:35.79]Map display.
[13:36.69]Interact.
[13:38.33]Move.
[13:39.23]Dash.
[13:39.59]Press while moving to dash.
[13:41.72]Press while still to crouch.
[13:44.01]Thank you for playing Let It Die on the Death Drive 128.
[13:46.55]Please read Barb's Bible thoroughly to aid you in your brutality.
[13:51.11]I almost said birthday.
[13:52.63]You can be at any time in the Underworld Rolodex.
[13:53.95]You can open... You can open the Underworld Rolodex from the options menu.
[13:59.13]It's like a weird Captain America face.
[14:01.55]With like a snowboarding logo on his head.
[14:05.05]Okay, well... There, that's guard.
[14:07.65]Let's just... Okay, you have to tap it to dodge.
[14:12.43]There's sprint...
[14:18.02]L1 and R1 don't... Okay, I guess... I don't know how I did that.
[14:23.55]I just did that somehow.
[14:29.25]Good thing you guys have subtitles.
[14:36.30]Here we go, first enemy.
[14:37.32]He's holding a corkscrew.
[14:42.90]Three levels of punishment.
[14:44.40]How come he gets that and I don't?
[14:45.44]Let me try.
[14:47.86]Alright, I'm going to try to combo him.
[14:52.85]Oh, I'm just going to get, like, shocked.
[14:55.91]Okay, he's going to do three in a row.
[15:02.90]The dodge doesn't seem to stay locked on.
[15:05.62]I'm just going to go by the...
[15:12.70]Okay.
[15:14.30]What happens if I guard?
[15:17.50]You can't like guard that thing.
[15:25.47]One more.
[15:28.07]I beat the game.
[15:31.40]Oh, that's his item.
[15:32.44]Okay, hold on.
[15:40.27]Okay, buzzsaw, knuckles, one-handed weapon required, HP 200.
[15:42.81]You have to have a certain amount of health to put it on.
[15:48.61]And then what?
[15:48.99]You put it in your left hand, we'll put it in the right hand, I guess.
[15:51.19]10, 19, okay.
[15:57.18]Right?
[15:59.98]This is fucking loud.
[16:03.66]We're gonna have to turn it down again.
[16:09.93]Hold on, speaker... Is that speaker as in... I kind of want to turn that off.
[16:15.41]Is that speaker as in that's him talking through the phone?
[16:21.22]I'm going to assume that's what that is.
[16:22.78]I'm going to turn vibration up too.
[16:24.72]I don't want that shit.
[16:30.02]Alright, this thing is going to kick ass.
[16:31.06]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[16:33.63]Can I carve up the body?
[16:36.91]I don't think so.
[16:38.11]Let's keep going.
[16:45.07]The X's interact, alright.
[16:49.75]Alright, this is like a Dark Souls type game.
[16:51.25]You know that shit around the corners is gonna grab you and like suck all your HP down.
[16:56.51]About equipment.
[16:57.15]Many pieces of equipment are featured in the game.
[16:59.01]Let's take a look at a few basic rules.
[17:01.82]Equipment includes weapons which may be equipped on the right, left, or both hands, and three types of armor.
[17:07.46]Head, upper body, and lower body.
[17:09.53]Every piece of equipment has durability, which decreases each time it is used.
[17:13.59]When the durability reaches zero, the equipment will break, so be careful.
[17:16.60]Okay.
[17:19.26]There are single-handed weapons, which you can equip in each hand, and double-handed weapons you can equip in one of.
[17:24.60]It's your choice which weapon you become proficient with.
[17:27.73]You can store and carry the various items you find in the tower in your death bag.
[17:31.37]Just an inventory.
[17:34.87]Both the left and right arm have three weapon slots.
[17:37.61]Use the directional buttons to quickly switch between weapons equipped in these slots.
[17:43.17]Alright.
[17:44.35]I see.
[17:44.65]Okay, so... Oh boy, that's a little... That's a little funky.
[17:48.15]So, left on the D-pad cycles through your left hand and right on the D-pad cycles... Alright.
[17:54.14]Let's keep moving.
[17:54.88]And there's no durability with your hands, I guess, so... Cool.
[17:57.38]Yeah, you should be able to jump and shimmy up there somehow.
[18:06.57]Dude, I just played The Last Guardian.
[18:07.78]Don't think I know how to do that yet.
[18:10.38]Oh, another fucking weather balloon.
[18:12.60]Another weather balloon that tells you info.
[18:15.55]Rage Moves.
[18:17.61]In this game, you can unleash rage moves, techniques which are stronger than regular attacks.
[18:22.07]If you use these effectively, you will have an advantage in battle.
[18:25.39]Each time you deal damage to an enemy, your rage will build.
[18:28.66]This will increase in level until it reaches the maximum.
[18:31.92]When the rage gauge is full, hold triangle as you attack to unleash a powerful rage move with your equipped weapon.
[18:38.52]So what is that, like an EX meter?
[18:41.51]I assume that's an EX meter, right?
[18:43.67]The number of gauges used up by the rage move depends on the weapon you're holding.
[18:49.15]Okay, I'm going to pretend that that's an EX meter.
[18:52.40]We'll find out, but let's be careful here.
[18:54.20]Can I like... Oh, rage.
[19:00.82]Alright, we got two enemies at the same time.
[19:07.85]When do you think I'm gonna die first?
[19:09.53]Remember in Bloodborne when you fight the werewolf in the first room and it's supposed to kill you?
[19:14.48]I wonder when I'm supposed to die.
[19:15.72]Yeah, these guys are like two levels higher than me.
[19:17.40]Oh, okay.
[19:17.90]Well, never mind.
[19:18.76]I just destroyed that lady.
[19:36.53]This guy's got a gun!
[19:38.05]That guy has a gun!
[19:39.33]That's not fair.
[19:39.93]It's like a little BB gun, but a gun nonetheless.
[19:51.90]Oh shit, I can't move.
[19:55.52]Okay, so when you run to the stamina, you physically just can't even move.
[20:00.80]This thing's almost broken.
[20:01.70]I want to save that for a big boss.
[20:10.96]Really?
[20:15.16]Get out of the jail cell!
[20:23.60]Reminds me of Manhunt, so you pick up, like, coins?
[20:28.23]Ooh, road shocker coat?
[20:32.59]I have no armor, so, I mean, that's...
[20:36.07]Those numbers are totally meaningless to me right now.
[20:40.58]What do those even mean?
[20:41.60]Can I get his gun?
[20:43.92]I guess he didn't drop it.
[20:45.66]Okay, now I'm just like a creepy man in a yellow hat from Curious George.
[20:52.15]Why would I kill the girl back here?
[20:55.29]She didn't drop anything either.
[20:58.13]Let's keep going.
[21:00.65]Yeah, type of fashion souls, right?
[21:05.97]I got three levels of rage.
[21:08.16]I thought that meant I was level three for some reason.
[21:10.14]Okay, well, I'll use it next time.
[21:13.88]Just a crossing guard.
[21:16.32]A crossing guard with like an evil drill.
[21:18.72]Let's give it a try.
[21:19.34]I'll try the rage move this time.
[21:20.80]Okay, we get to read some more.
[21:27.83]Eating mushrooms.
[21:29.53]You will encounter various types of mushrooms in this game.
[21:31.67]They have many uses, but here we'll explain their role as a food item.
[21:36.31]When you draw close to a mushroom, you can consume it quickly by selecting the eat icon, which will be displayed.
[21:43.27]When you put mushrooms in your death bag, they will be displayed in the flick box at the top right of the screen.
[21:50.28]Flick on the mushroom you want to eat with the touchpad and eat it by clicking the right side of the touchpad button.
[21:58.68]Okay.
[21:59.72]Not all mushrooms are beneficial to the player.
[22:01.34]Some mushrooms contain poison that can result in death, so be careful.
[22:06.93]The flick pad.
[22:09.85]Is this going to be the first game I've ever played to utilize the touchpad on the PS4 controller?
[22:15.24]Okay, Yogeshroom.
[22:21.48]Healing.
[22:23.81]I think I want to put it in my bag.
[22:24.95]Okay, so it's up there.
[22:29.45]How do I... I guess I click on the right side if I want to eat it.
[22:33.29]I have full health right now.
[22:37.18]licking my mushroom.
[22:38.68]Okay, now I get the joke.
[22:41.50]Alright, what is this?
[22:44.40]Gear elements.
[22:44.96]There are six types of equipment.
[22:46.26]Slashing, blunt, piercing, fire, lightning, and poison.
[22:51.42]Okay, weapon types.
[22:53.24]You can hold up to two types of weapon at the same time.
[22:55.86]It's important to pay attention to the type of armor the enemy is wearing and manage your weapons accordingly.
[23:01.84]Armor has a defense value that varies with the type.
[23:04.24]It's important to pay attention to the enemy's weapon and switch accordingly.
[23:08.77]Okay, well, how the hell do you know what vulnerability they have?
[23:11.75]I guess we'll find that out at some point.
[23:13.38]Let's open the briefcase.
[23:16.14]Ooh, magnum.
[23:20.38]Cool.
[23:20.92]Okay, I kind of want to... Should I put that in the left hand?
[23:23.66]I'm going to put that in the left hand.
[23:28.68]I guess it... No, does it have to be in the left?
[23:30.01]I guess, yeah.
[23:30.37]Okay, left hand.
[23:32.63]Magnum in the left hand.
[23:34.33]Just like Bloodborne.
[23:36.67]Dude, I'm playing Bloodborne again.
[23:38.01]I'm so happy.
[23:39.99]Wait, what?
[23:42.43]No, I guess I have to have it in my right hand?
[23:46.75]Yeah, it's like a... That's cool.
[23:49.21]Alright, this is cool.
[23:50.45]This is kind of cool.
[23:51.74]Kind of cool.
[23:52.18]Because I can switch it out like that.
[23:56.66]Okay.
[23:58.68]Let's shoot somebody.
[24:01.12]Is there a guy up there?
[24:03.74]No.
[24:05.56]The mushroom, put it in my yoga bag.
[24:10.68]Dark Souls with guns.
[24:13.16]I wonder if there's headshots.
[24:18.23]Oh, here we go.
[24:21.37]Uh oh, it's like mushrooms are like drugs.
[24:24.97]Uh oh.
[24:27.85]I better shoot her.
[24:29.49]Wait, maybe she's an NPC.
[24:30.82]Dark Souls NPCs, you like, do all their dialog.
[24:35.61]Come on.
[24:37.75]Throwing mushrooms.
[24:38.57]You will encounter both mushrooms and beasts in this game.
[24:40.99]Let's look at how to throw mushrooms.
[24:43.92]Choose a mushroom you wish to throw by flicking the touchpad to select one and click the left side of the touch button to throw.
[24:50.54]In this mode, you can throw mushrooms by pressing X. Okay, well... Oh my god.
[25:08.87]Okay, hopefully that didn't... What the fuck?
[25:21.33]Oh, okay.
[25:22.87]Well, you're welcome.
[25:34.68]Let's keep going.
[25:38.20]Gore-tastic attack.
[25:40.38]When you make an enemy groggy, that's when you can unleash a gore-tastic coupe de grâce.
[25:45.50]Coupe de grassy.
[25:46.16]That's a French word.
[25:47.01]I'm not French.
[25:48.19]These moves are so awesomely brutal.
[25:50.07]Typo!
[25:50.67]There's a fucking extra space there.
[25:52.77]Come on, FromSoftware.
[25:54.19]Or, uh, what is it?
[25:55.67]Grasshopper Software.
[25:57.85]You might even want to cover your eyes.
[25:58.93]Making an enemy groggy.
[25:59.73]By unleashing a continuous barrage of attacks on the enemy, you can make them groggy.
[26:03.67]Of course, this can happen to your character as well, so take care.
[26:07.01]By approaching an enemy in a groggy state, holding triangle, and pressing an attack button, a goretastic attack will activate depending on the weapon used.
[26:15.17]If you defeat an enemy using a goretastic attack, you will receive more rewards than usual.
[26:19.20]Alright, so you gotta get him to like a dazed state, get up and hold triangle, and then press like right stick or left stick?
[26:28.36]Uh... Okay.
[26:31.74]Oh god.
[26:37.53]Let's try the gun.
[26:41.49]I missed.
[26:43.21]Oh my god, this person hurts a lot.
[26:46.81]Oh shit, multiple people.
[26:47.95]That does a lot of damage though.
[26:57.84]We're just gonna move him around.
[27:02.00]They can hurt each other too.
[27:05.68]That's a lot of stagger, have to stay in there after shooting this thing.
[27:16.03]Kind of- Wow, these guys hurt.
[27:18.69]That weapon's broken.
[27:22.43]Oh shit, I forgot it's like analog controlled.
[27:28.16]What the fuck?
[27:31.34]I just tried to do like an EX move there.
[27:34.09]It has to reload.
[27:34.67]Of course it does.
[27:35.81]Mushroom!
[27:38.23]Eat that mushroom!
[27:38.99]What is this?
[27:40.23]Oh my god, this weapon kinda sucks.
[28:16.35]What?
[28:19.01]What?
[28:22.59]I just got shot with a machine gun?
[28:30.79]What is going on?
[28:44.15]Wanna try again?
[28:45.87]Oh, wait.
[28:46.91]Let me put the title logo up real quick.
[28:49.25]You know how these things go.
[28:51.23]Woohoo!
[28:55.43]Well, that was fun.
[28:59.27]Skate 3.
[29:01.39]See, I'm controlling the character right now, guys.
[29:03.54]See how much better I got.
[29:05.48]Let it die.
[29:12.44]That was kind of fun.
[29:25.18]Thank you, Mr. Watsits, for three months.
[29:27.54]Premium pillow for two months.
[29:30.43]25% of the big milestone.
[29:33.03]We'll see if you stick around for that long.
[29:34.45]If you do, if you don't, you have under no obligation, Watsits, but thanks for three months.
[29:39.58]Thank you for listening to this voice guidance system.
[29:43.22]Let us embark on a journey of discovery about the many wonders of the Tower of Barbs.
[29:49.92]The Tower of Barb is located on the tiny 3.7 square mile island in South Tokyo.
[29:54.76]Yeah, it's free to play.
[29:57.50]Be wary of nudity?
[29:58.68]Is nudity in this game?
[29:59.62]Well, alright.
[29:59.94]Wait, what?
[30:00.58]Anybody know where it is so I can potentially try to avoid it?
[30:03.34]Many say that the tower is actually growing with each passing year.
[30:20.23]Legend has it that a great treasure lies at the top of the tower.
[30:25.05]As such, many brave people often attempt to climb the tower to obtain those riches.
[30:31.74]However, none have managed to survive the tower's horrific trials.
[30:37.06]And thus, the tower stands as a grim reminder of the many lives lost in search of this mythical treasure.
[30:47.19]You've played for 10 hours and seen no nudity.
[30:49.45]Yeah, maybe it's just like a random thing you can come across.
[30:52.79]It's the strip club.
[30:54.53]Watch out for the strip club.
[30:58.03]No, this is like piquing my interest.
[30:59.34]I'm actually excited to play this right now.
[31:01.02]Because I'm like a... I love Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne.
[31:05.54]Bloodborne's like one of my favorite games of all time.
[31:07.72]So any chance I get to like do it again... Huh?
[31:14.24]I'm talking about the Death Drive 128, of course, man.
[31:18.20]You were just playing it, remember?
[31:20.82]Hey, pretty cool, huh?
[31:22.70]Pretty badass?
[31:25.96]It's the best game console ever.
[31:27.66]And this game?
[31:28.80]Let it die.
[31:30.68]It's probably the greatest game ever made.
[31:35.61]Wait, we're playing a video game?
[31:38.77]Just make it to the top of the Tower of Barbs.
[31:42.21]It's like a hack and slash roguelike kind of a thing.
[31:44.73]Hey, dude, you're a gamer, aren't you?
[31:49.98]Then you'll totally be fine.
[31:51.84]Just try it out.
[31:56.16]I'll set it up for you.
[31:57.22]I think that's just a guy in a mask.
[32:02.18]Let's get started.
[32:09.09]Uh, you have a beetle.
[32:15.06]He pulls out some dice, we start playing Swindlestone.
[32:20.00]What's happening?
[32:22.31]Alright, I guess I'm in like the VR world.
[32:30.13]So it's just like a virtual reality console.
[32:31.95]Uh...
[32:45.15]Ah, game crashed.
[32:45.77]What do you know?
[32:46.89]Of course it did.
[32:56.94]Okay.
[32:57.80]Press any button.
[33:00.64]Store!
[33:01.22]You can go on the store.
[33:02.02]I already went on the store.

[33:08.48]Game start.
[33:09.34]Let it die!
[33:10.44]Should we just do it again?
[33:16.35]Okay.
[33:17.69]I'll just pick this guy.
[33:21.97]This is a PS4 exclusive game at the moment.
[33:30.42]So do I get off the train and talk to Uncle Death again, or what?
[33:41.54]Well, I think we just gotta...
[33:44.12]Oh, Bramerate just kind of died right there.
[33:45.54]Alright, my guy's name is Dean.
[33:46.70]I didn't name him Dean.
[33:54.57]Oh, no, this opened up.
[33:57.31]This wasn't open before.
[34:01.62]Interesting.
[34:05.43]No, we got another balloon.
[34:06.25]What is this?
[34:09.15]Waiting room.
[34:09.96]The hub of your adventure.
[34:11.06]This is the waiting room of the station, bottom of Barb's.
[34:13.88]The last stop of line 15.
[34:15.88]Situated under the tower of Barb's, this room contains many interesting features.
[34:19.04]Just what are you waiting for?
[34:19.97]Are you asked?
[34:20.43]Perhaps the question should be, what is waiting for you?
[34:23.41]When you want to quit playing, please select back to the title from the options menu when you're in the waiting room.
[34:30.19]Okay.
[34:31.35]If you quit the game outside of the waiting room, it will be treated as a death, so please be careful.
[34:34.83]Look at that picture.
[34:38.30]Okay, so that's just to punish you if you want to try to rage quit the game before you die or disconnect or something.
[34:43.46]Oh, there's the strip club.
[34:46.77]Oh, what is this?
[34:50.82]Choku Funsha.
[34:52.50]Commodore Suzuki is the manager of the store.
[34:54.80]You can give him the blueprints and materials that you find in the tower and ask him to develop equipment.
[34:59.32]After the equipment has been developed, it can be mass produced and sold in the store.
[35:03.76]Finding things to be sold in the store, however, is the player's responsibility.
[35:10.05]So what, he bring him blueprints?
[35:13.53]Does he have anything for me now?
[35:18.54]Welcome.
[35:20.16]Our express service is all you need to climb the tower.

[42:45.58]This weird VR game.
[42:49.57]Alright.
[42:51.45]Wait, that's where I died before.
[42:52.57]That's my other body.
[42:56.23]What?
[42:56.91]Oh, come on.
[42:57.57]Oh, come on.
[42:58.77]I'm just staggered.
[42:59.51]That's just me.
[42:59.89]Alright, I'm gonna play this safe.
[43:24.37]Reload.
[43:25.47]Come on, load it!
[43:27.54]Ooh!
[43:29.82]Sorry, did I get all my stuff back?
[43:34.54]This is really something, huh?
[43:55.07]How do I reload the gun manually?
[43:58.13]Is it like one of those Resident Evil situations?
[44:02.05]Hold on.
[44:04.56]I guarantee it's like Resident Evil 4.
[44:06.56]You have to, like, hold a button and... Oh, I wanna see.
[44:10.14]Shoot.
[44:10.52]Let's see.
[44:13.90]Shit, um... Come on, what is reload?
[44:22.75]There has to be a reload.
[44:28.91]I have no idea what it is.
[44:29.85]I'm sure it's something weird.
[44:32.37]X plus R2.
[44:35.41]What?
[44:36.99]What?
[44:37.53]Why?
[44:38.15]X and R2?
[44:39.05]Okay.
[44:43.18]R1 and triangle.
[44:45.30]Haterfication.
[44:46.20]If your fighter exhausts their HP in this game, they will die and be resurrected as an enemy.
[44:51.54]When a fighter dies, they will transform into an enemy, roaming about on the floor on which they met their demise.
[44:56.86]Such fighters are called haters.
[44:59.93]If you assume control of a new fighter and defeat the hater, they will be retrieved and stored in the fighter freezer.
[45:06.85]If you let them be and they defeat another player, the rewards will be sent to your rewards box.
[45:14.05]Huh?
[45:15.37]All enemies with names displayed in orange are haters.
[45:18.30]They might be one of your haters or a hater that was once a different player.
[45:22.60]In either case, they're far stronger than most of the other enemies you will face.
[45:25.66]Watch out for them.
[45:29.70]Okay.
[45:31.06]So if people die in this game, they're resurrected as other people's enemies.
[45:36.20]Interesting.
[45:39.12]If you kill, they go back to the freezer?
[45:42.53]Well, whatever.
[45:43.05]I need health.
[45:49.09]Where are the mushrooms?
[45:55.88]Nice and slow.
[46:00.11]I have new mail.
[46:01.55]Uh, body armor.
[46:02.39]Uh, yeah, just put that on.
[46:03.89]Trucker apron.
[46:07.50]This really is just manhunt.
[46:09.66]More like condemned.
[46:12.32]Okay, where is he?
[46:13.08]I just heard noise.
[46:18.34]REM sleep?
[46:21.65]What does that even mean?
[46:23.33]Let's just see what it does.
[46:24.21]REM sleep.
[46:26.97]Eat it.
[46:27.19]Are you gonna heal me?
[46:36.66]Oh, I can move, but I'm asleep.
[46:38.80]Is it healing me?
[46:43.59]What is the purpose of this mushroom?
[46:51.97]And?
[46:54.14]What did that even do?
[46:55.54]Didn't even do anything.
[47:03.29]What's that frog?
[47:04.93]There are a great variety of creatures besides enemies in this game.
[47:07.29]Not all of them are docile.
[47:08.81]Some will attack you while others will emit poison.
[47:11.19]It's important for the player to make use of these beasts in order to survive.
[47:14.87]By pressing L3 you can crouch.
[47:17.17]When you approach a beast in this stance, the capture beast icon will appear in the bottom center of the screen.
[47:23.78]What?
[47:24.72]It's like the eat icon when you catch a beast to eat it.
[47:29.79]If you choose to store it in your death bag, the number of beasts in your possession will be displayed in the flick box.
[47:34.94]You can flick on the beast you want to eat with the touchpad and consume it by clicking... Grilling beasts?
[47:42.12]You can cook beasts.
[47:45.10]Right, okay, and you throw it into the fire.
[47:49.03]Grilling beast changes the effect that they provide.
[47:51.65]Mushrooms will sprout from the corpse of any animal that you kill by stomping or by any other method.
[47:57.39]Alright, well, let's, like, steal this one.
[48:00.57]Restores HP.
[48:05.75]Should I just eat it?
[48:08.11]I kind of like died.
[48:08.93]I don't like want to eat this.
[48:09.97]Oh shit.
[48:10.79]No!
[48:13.79]Fuck!
[48:14.13]I was trying to like... Where is he?
[48:17.23]Get up from under there.
[48:22.70]Oh god damn it.
[48:25.02]I was trying to pick him back up.
[48:25.98]I didn't know I could stomp him that quickly.
[48:27.64]There we go.
[48:28.86]Okay, I'm going to sneak up on him again.
[48:33.22]I'm just going to eat him.
[48:35.24]I need health.
[48:35.72]There we go.
[48:42.81]Okay, I hear another frog.
[48:54.29]I'm gonna store this one.
[48:57.45]I have one frog.
[48:58.57]That's so weird, man.
[49:04.42]Alright, here we go.
[49:06.40]Mastery level.
[49:09.51]If you defeat lots of enemies with a specific type of weapon, your mastery level with that weapon will go up.
[49:14.38]The maximum level is 20, and you'll unlock sub moves that you can use with L1 or R1, as well as new attacks and skill boosts.
[49:21.64]Ability points will be rewarded to the weapon which dealt the final damage in defeating an enemy.
[49:26.81]Once you get a certain amount of points, your mastery level will increase.
[49:31.85]They're not shared between fighters.
[49:33.93]Oh boy.
[49:34.41]Even if you switch to a low-level fighter, you will still be able to deal attacks corresponding to your mastery level.
[49:40.37]Oh, they are shared.
[49:41.03]Okay.
[49:42.63]Okay, that's cool.
[49:43.44]It's kind of like how you level up weapons, I guess.
[49:47.20]Alright.
[49:48.42]Whatever.
[49:49.26]More frogs.
[49:55.42]Ah!
[50:16.73]I'm locked onto him.
[50:18.50]I guess you gotta wait for twin shots.
[50:21.74]Nice aim.
[50:23.12]God, it's controller aim.
[50:24.28]It's kind of tricky sometimes.
[50:26.56]No, reload it.
[50:27.44]Don't shoot it.
[50:42.35]Steal the frogs.
[50:46.19]I don't like the frog's voice.
[50:49.49]It's not froggy enough for me.
[50:50.95]I should get another weapon.
[50:53.69]Alright, I hear a guy.
[51:05.09]Where is he?
[51:05.71]He's going to sprint out from around here, isn't he?
[51:13.21]He's up there.
[51:14.47]Can I read this without him coming down here?
[51:17.11]I'm not going to risk it.
[51:26.58]How did I miss that second shot?
[51:31.01]Okay.
[51:33.15]Alright.
[51:52.45]Get fucking blasted, dude.
[51:54.15]Step on him!
[51:54.75]Stomp him!
[51:55.23]Ooh, there's a wrench.
[52:03.21]Iron hammer.
[52:03.71]Let's put that in the right hand.
[52:10.79]Alright, cool.
[52:13.83]What is this?
[52:17.01]You obtained page one, Yotsuyama Bionics.
[52:21.73]I think we're safe to read this.
[52:25.77]Stamps.
[52:27.99]There's always one stamp station on each level of the Tower of Barb.
[52:31.79]You can stamp each one once into the stamp section of the Underworld Rolodex.
[52:35.76]It's possible to climb the tower without stamping, but you get rewards if you do.
[52:39.48]A stamp minigame will begin.
[52:42.98]Press X with good timing and press the falling stamps button.
[52:47.95]This is a lot of information to take in.
[52:50.49]This like stamps, there's a stamp machine, okay.
[52:54.83]What do I do here?
[52:55.93]I have to stamp at the right time?
[52:57.01]Do I hold X?
[53:08.20]I don't, what the hell is this?
[53:10.36]What?
[53:18.95]I don't have any idea what that is.
[53:24.03]But it's broken now, apparently.
[53:26.19]Okay.
[53:29.05]Sure thing.
[53:32.74]Another one of those freak shows.
[53:33.86]There's a mushroom right there, too.
[53:36.68]Let's take this guy out.
[53:38.30]Take this guy out with, like, a big swing.
[53:39.54]What do you say?
[53:39.98]Oh, that didn't do anything.
[53:46.61]Hmm.
[53:47.81]There we go.
[53:58.54]I'm trying to hold down triangle and do like a big finishing move.
[54:01.30]Okay, there it goes.
[54:05.49]Alright, so you need two points to do it.
[54:08.53]This thing's gonna break though.
[54:09.51]Let's go back to the gun.
[54:16.33]This is the Restore's HP heart shroom.
[54:19.19]Let's just put it in my pack.
[54:26.18]There he is.
[54:26.64]He's right behind me.
[54:27.21]He's gonna break through.
[54:27.99]I've played these games before.
[54:30.53]Go on, do it.
[54:32.91]Smash through the grates like you know you were supposed to do.
[54:35.65]Or maybe not.
[54:47.18]Oh, okay.
[54:47.78]There's a guy.
[54:48.34]Another guy.
[54:48.82]That's a crit, dude.
[55:02.35]Shit, I'm trying to dodge it around him.
[55:10.31]Where you going?
[55:10.95]Hey, hey, hey!
[55:11.65]Back here!
[55:16.23]Running away, huh?
[55:20.12]Get crushed!
[55:22.92]Seven.
[55:23.30]Oh, pants!
[55:25.30]Put on those pants.
[55:25.92]I actually have clothes on now.
[55:28.30]Nice.
[55:28.76]This thing's gonna break.
[55:32.49]Hopefully there's... How do I get more ammo?
[55:34.45]Or is it like... I kind of wanted to shoot this.
[55:40.95]Why did I do that?
[55:44.52]I shouldn't have done that.
[55:54.51]Come on, really?
[55:55.11]The last shot didn't hit.
[56:08.00]Well, it worked out.
[56:11.28]Dr. Drill Body.
[56:12.38]This is 22 out of 43.
[56:13.68]Do I have on right now?
[56:17.97]So I gain some electrical defense.
[56:22.17]I lose some... Whatever.
[56:23.37]I'm just going to put it on.
[56:24.05]It probably looks cooler than the dumb thing I have on right now.
[56:28.91]Is Dean Dominator going to be in the recurring Jerma character now?
[56:32.62]Hold triangle and hit the attack button.
[56:34.74]I was doing that.
[56:35.44]I think it has to be a certain... Like, for instance, the hammer.
[56:39.88]I think I have to have two points to do the hammer's execution move.
[56:45.87]But this is, I think, one, but I wasn't reloaded.
[56:58.33]It's probably a secret down here, right?
[57:01.83]I think we just go until we can't find it.
[57:11.43]I guess I can't open this.
[57:17.34]I guess not.
[57:19.28]It's great though.
[57:24.54]Coins.
[57:27.64]I guess I can't open this anymore.
[57:40.79]Jungle machete.
[57:44.65]Let's put that in the other hand.
[57:49.56]Is there weight in this game?
[57:51.40]Ooh, I like this thing.
[57:56.04]This thing's actually pretty cool.
[57:59.26]I've got three frogs in my pocket.
[58:00.77]Yeah, I do.
[58:08.37]Let's see if I can get him with this one.
[58:14.48]Ah.
[58:16.74]Oh, shit.
[58:19.08]Oh, there's a lot of people here.
[58:20.92]Okay, back it up.
[58:30.71]What's that, like, missile launch that person had?
[58:33.85]Oh, fuck it.
[58:35.77]Yeah!
[58:40.04]Not a good place to be.
[58:41.74]I'm just getting grinded up.
[58:52.38]Jesus.
[59:02.28]Get out of here.
[59:06.32]Where's my EX filter?
[59:07.20]Alright, hold on.
[59:16.02]Shh, there's another guy right there too.
[59:19.29]Quick, eat a frog!
[59:21.27]What's that thing?
[59:35.47]Shit.
[59:35.83]Come on.
[59:36.23]Last bullet.
[59:38.72]Ah, you son of a bitch.
[59:42.48]Alright, that's two more, right?
[59:52.89]Is that it?
[59:54.33]Well, I have a better buzzsaw mastery now.
[59:56.35]It's the only weapon I have.
[59:59.83]Lay off the frogs.
[60:03.70]Yeah, the durability kind of sucks.
[60:05.20]There's probably something eventually that you can do to make it decrease lower.
[60:12.70]Apparently all my pants are broken.
[60:16.30]Interesting, I guess.
[60:20.16]Let's just keep going this way.
[60:23.47]Probably because it's early in.
[60:24.35]Yeah.
[60:25.71]Something like that.
[60:27.23]One more guy here.
[60:30.49]Eat it!
[60:32.59]Alright, that was cool.
[60:34.31]The EX with this thing shoots out the blades.
[60:39.11]It's gonna break too.
[60:40.13]I'm gonna have to use my hands, my shitty hands.
[60:43.25]Not looking forward to that.
[60:50.13]These guys are slow.
[60:51.05]I'm gonna just make this guy come up first.
[61:02.46]Grind his head off.
[61:07.02]Get him before he can do anything.
[61:08.08]He's dead.
[61:30.54]This sounds like the blind guy theme.
[61:32.66]It kind of does.
[61:36.81]Can somebody drop something, please?
[61:40.81]Of course not.
[61:49.46]What is this?
[61:52.52]This looks like something weird to interact with.
[61:54.62]Apparently not.
[61:55.18]It's like a spider web?
[61:57.80]Wow, what an excellent gamer.
[62:05.99]So breaking boxes is a good thing.
[62:09.09]Make sure I didn't miss anything down here.
[62:11.81]So it's not like the Souls games where breaking a box doesn't do anything for you.
[62:14.61]These actually have currency in them.
[62:18.13]Let's... I want to look down here.
[62:24.33]It's all about that stamina management, Mushroom.
[62:28.24]Attack plus 50% up.
[62:29.48]Oh, I was in the back.
[62:38.58]This is probably dangerous for me to keep exploring down here when I don't have any weapons or anything.
[62:41.64]Hopefully there's something in here.
[62:42.60]I don't want this crazy person to be Plants vs. Zombies ahead of me.
[62:48.68]Oh my fucking lord!
[62:49.90]Why?
[62:50.20]Damn it!
[62:53.07]I hope I can get you a weapon when I kill you.
[62:57.59]Shit, I think I'm healed.
[63:14.23]Easy with the stamina here.
[63:15.37]The guy needs one hit.
[63:21.22]Get out of here!
[63:23.02]Ah, come on.
[63:24.22]That was it right there.
[63:31.79]You can't dodge that much.
[63:33.17]You lose way too much stamina.
[63:45.49]I don't like him unarmed.
[63:46.43]You gotta be too close.
[63:54.17]Fuck.
[63:56.93]He broke all my shit too.
[64:03.15]Is he dazed yet?
[64:03.91]How did that one miss?
[64:13.73]What?
[64:18.33]Oh, you're level 2!
[64:20.01]I gotta beat you!
[64:22.51]There we go.
[64:24.29]Alright, we got a frog.
[64:25.37]We're good.
[64:27.03]There's a cone head.
[64:27.82]Road shocker head.
[64:30.00]I'm gonna eat a frog.
[64:30.98]Hold on, let me see if I can put this on.
[64:41.62]Yeah, back to being a naked guy.
[64:43.18]No items.
[64:43.80]What's better?
[64:44.72]Trucker hat?
[64:48.08]They're both the exact same defense, but Trucker Hat has a little bit more... I can sell it, right, can't I?
[65:00.11]There's another guy.
[65:01.07]Oh, there's a frog.
[65:03.26]Come on.
[65:12.16]Oh, there's a new armor right here.
[65:14.04]Put it on before this.
[65:14.66]I don't even care what it is.
[65:15.40]Just put it on.
[65:17.34]I need it to fight this group of enemies that are probably right here.
[65:20.14]Or this one.
[65:20.86]I'm gonna sneak up behind this guy.
[65:22.96]Is that a thing in this game?
[65:23.82]Are you serious?
[65:30.52]That was unbelievable.
[65:31.84]I just did a fucking suplex to this guy.
[65:38.71]No, not with a stupid cone head.
[65:46.22]Yeah, I guess I got a dunce cap on now.
[65:51.84]Awesome.
[65:54.10]Thank God I finally have a weapon.
[65:58.78]Only took a hundred years.
[66:07.22]Uh, this is new.
[66:13.54]Elevator.
[66:13.94]The Tower of Barb's features not only escalators, but elevators also, including the DH Express Royal Elevator.
[66:19.24]There's also a system of rare sub-elevators that run only between certain floors of the tower.
[66:24.73]For more information, look at your Bible.
[66:27.75]When you discover an elevator in the tower, turn the power switch on to allow the elevator to stop at that floor.
[66:33.71]Once you've done this, you can just use some kill coins and hop in the elevator anytime you wish to return to that floor.
[66:40.89]Using elevators to return to the waiting room and refresh yourself is probably a good idea if you want a pleasant climb to the summit.
[67:06.85]Yeah, that's the second floor alright.
[67:08.01]Let's um let's go in here.
[67:09.35]Just activate it Sub only elevators what a sellout There's a guy in that one.
[67:22.28]Yeah, did you see that?
[67:25.44]There was a person in that one
[67:33.64]Waiting room.
[67:34.16]Okay, so you can spend money to go back to the waiting room.
[67:40.73]I think I'm alright.
[67:42.81]I got a weapon.
[67:44.17]Although, maybe I should.
[67:45.01]Let's just see.
[67:45.61]I just want to see what happens.
[67:46.53]Let's just try it.
[67:47.49]Waiting room.
[67:49.49]I'm curious as to what it actually does.
[67:50.98]Oh, that's the AI check?
[67:56.56]So, I'm going to see what doing the left one does.
[68:10.97]Yeah, you gotta go back and level up.
[68:12.07]Okay, let's see.
[68:13.87]So... Oh, look, you can see on the map.
[68:16.56]That's cool.
[68:23.04]What?
[68:25.74]It shows you all this dumb shit you did?
[68:27.60]This is cool, though, because you can see where you didn't go.
[68:49.59]Maybe we could go right, but that door is locked somehow.
[68:54.80]Acquired plans, beasts killed.
[68:56.58]That's cool.
[68:58.90]This actually is a pretty fun game.
[69:00.96]First impressions wise, this is actually pretty fun to play.
[69:04.94]I'm not sure how repetitive it'll get eventually.
[69:14.69]And there it is.
[69:15.21]There's the end.
[69:15.65]Oh, no.
[69:16.25]Okay, there's the end.
[69:18.12]That's cool.
[69:23.15]I look like a rat in a maze.
[69:27.39]I have new mail.
[69:31.79]Hey.
[69:33.87]Mingo head?
[69:37.16]Oh, it's sucking my coins out.
[69:41.60]So that's good, because now I won't lose them when I die.
[69:48.20]Whoop, new box.
[69:54.14]19 hours and... Oh, no.
[69:56.74]What?
[69:58.42]Oh, here comes the mobile game mechanic.
[70:05.88]Mingo Head.
[70:06.41]Mingo Head is the game's fighter training machine with a fancy character who will always greet the player when they return to the waiting room.
[70:13.13]He's not all show, however, but a valuable character.
[70:14.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:16.35]You will receive EXP for defeating enemies and eating mushrooms in the tower.
[70:19.59]You can raise your fighters' level EXP, can be used, blah, blah, blah.
[70:23.58]Upon returning to the waiting room, Mingo Hill will absorb all the kill coins and splithium you've collected.
[70:27.90]If you have enough experience to level up, you can split the points between your six stats to become stronger.
[70:33.36]HP is health.
[70:35.26]Mainly affect your physical strength for non-ammo weapons.
[70:37.75]Strength is melee.
[70:40.13]Dexterity is firearms.
[70:43.82]Defensive capabilities is vitality.
[70:45.72]Stamina is the maximum stamina.
[70:47.33]Of course, luck.
[70:49.47]This is not like a Dark Souls type game without luck, of course.
[70:52.19]This will influence the amount of kill coins you receive as well as improving your chance of a crit.
[70:57.37]Okay.
[70:58.91]What the hell do I want to do then?
[71:01.68]How many points do I have?
[71:02.42]Okay, I have...
[71:10.38]Oh, this is like per character, isn't it?
[71:11.80]Well, I like the melee build a little bit.
[71:15.54]We're going to go with two points in strength.
[71:18.94]And... Maybe one point in luck for the crit.
[71:22.96]And one point... Two points in... What do you think?
[71:36.07]Just be a pretty much melee guy?
[71:40.43]All luck.
[71:44.11]I feel like I've been running out of stamina more than I should though.
[71:46.91]Punch only.
[71:47.69]No, we'll do melee.
[71:48.51]We'll try it out.
[71:50.15]I like the melee mechanics a little better than the gun mechanics.
[71:55.01]All luck or no stream?
[71:59.05]Vitality was defense.
[72:02.79]Oh, it actually shows it in real time over there on the right.
[72:04.47]That's cool.
[72:07.16]How many coins does this cost?
[72:12.20]10 charisma.
[72:12.54]Let's just do this.
[72:14.22]I'm sure.
[72:14.64]Now I'm going to be a force to be reckoned with.
[72:22.15]Spawn a Deathclaw.
[72:25.41]Alright, I have 283.
[72:27.89]I have new mail.
[72:32.25]The coffee machine!
[72:37.15]This is the bank that holds the kill coins you receive from treasure chests after defeating enemies.
[72:41.75]They'll be automatically stored in your bank when you return to the waiting room.
[72:44.99]When you make a purchase at a store that accepts kill coins, the amount will be deducted from your bank.
[72:51.89]Okay, so this is just the bank.
[72:55.50]Now, do I have anything I can do with him now?
[72:59.82]Sell... I think I'm gonna sell the gun.
[73:05.33]Because I'm doing melee.
[73:07.21]Fuck the gun.
[73:07.78]I don't even want it.
[73:10.68]Trucker apron?
[73:11.38]No.
[73:11.62]I'm going to need this in case I break shit.
[73:14.92]Although I don't have very much in my bag.
[73:16.56]I don't have any blueprints for him yet.
[73:25.53]Come back anytime.
[73:27.93]Alright.
[73:29.57]I have a couple of frogs left.
[73:32.07]Leveled up.
[73:34.25]I guess you just regen in here?
[73:35.73]What is this?
[73:40.26]By accessing the Vanishing Point Fountain in the center of the waiting room, you can suspend your game and return to the hated arcade.
[73:47.02]The waters of the fountain will also heal your wounds and soothe your troubled soul.
[73:51.31]The arcade you're in now at Takadanobaba in the Shinjuku Ward of Tokyo.
[73:57.87]The official Death Drive 128 is installed here.
[74:04.91]Uncle death lets it so you go to the game Fighting games good play various hints during the game high school or The barb this is a little hot going on here so I can leave the game and Go back to the arcade which is not the game.
[74:26.18]It's the game outside the game I
[74:32.13]Alright.
[74:41.13]Let's just keep going.
[74:45.72]Can I use this elevator?
[74:49.02]I don't think so.
[74:51.38]Let's go back to where we were.
[74:52.56]It's 120 coins to use the elevator.
[74:55.73]Let's use it.
[74:59.95]Cook some frogs?
[75:01.67]Actually, that's true.
[75:02.33]Hold on, something else is telling me... It's giving me more information.
[75:13.19]Alright, there are many enemies in this game, but if you defeat a hater, you receive splithium, which can be stored in this coffin.
[75:18.83]When you return to the waiting room from the tower, it'll automatically be stored, yeah?
[75:23.41]Splithium is used for equipment R&D and expanding the facilities in your base.
[75:30.62]Alright, well let's cook some frogs.
[75:31.68]I don't know where he is.
[75:36.93]I can just throw him in the fire, right?
[75:39.13]Is that gonna work?
[75:40.51]Okay, yeah, it worked.
[75:50.60]I have a cooked frog now.
[75:58.34]Oh shit, he bounced off.
[76:02.24]Hey, come here.
[76:14.57]Alright.
[76:17.09]Sounds easy enough.
[76:19.17]I guess I can just cook them from the station, but what about these?
[76:23.54]This is health, but what if I cook it?
[76:35.61]Where is the actual cooking station?
[76:37.15]Instead of just throwing it in a fire.
[76:38.55]Is it like right here?
[76:39.19]Oh, there we go.
[76:43.70]Okay.
[76:46.26]Is it cooked?
[76:56.33]Okay, now it is.
[77:02.05]I wish I could see what it did when you cooked it.
[77:03.67]Because it changes the properties, I think, right?
[77:10.33]Well, these are all cooked now.
[77:11.35]I don't know what that really does.
[77:12.27]Let's see what they changed.
[77:13.41]Okay, now it just lasts longer.
[77:17.39]Restores HP.
[77:19.25]Medium restores HP.
[77:20.39]I guess it just makes them better.
[77:24.71]Fill the room with live frogs that you brought here.
[77:27.19]Alright, let's keep going.
[77:32.83]Let's continue our journey through the tower.
[77:39.64]Looks good for a free-to-play.
[77:42.48]I haven't... I mean, this is only, like, the first or second floor, but I'm, uh... I'm having fun so far.
[77:50.53]Get a decal?
[77:52.21]Oh, that's right.
[77:52.75]Decals.
[77:53.17]Yeah, whatever.
[77:54.25]I'll do it again when I come back.
[78:08.33]No decals, no quests.
[78:13.40]What happened to the pants?
[78:14.18]I'm not sure.
[78:16.44]I don't know what happened to my pants.
[78:17.52]They're gone.
[78:17.88]Alright, what are you... Can you stop doing that to me?
[78:30.38]He's gonna forget to get a decal next time too.
[78:32.04]I will not.
[78:32.62]I will make sure I don't forget.
[78:39.80]Unload the toad.
[78:46.25]Tell us a joke?
[78:46.91]Alright.
[78:48.41]What are the... What do the bankers say to the flight attendant?
[79:01.10]I don't know.
[79:09.20]Nice flight.
[79:11.17]I'm in first class.
[79:14.41]And it's beautiful up here.
[79:16.33]Let me see something here.
[79:23.78]DH service.
[79:27.50]Let me just open this.
[79:28.64]I haven't even opened it one time.
[79:31.19]Reading your letters.
[79:33.43]Beast in the barbs.
[79:34.61]About treasure boxes.

[79:48.15]Beast in the barbs.
[79:49.01]Yeah, he loads a beast in the tower.
[79:51.53]Duty arms.
[79:52.47]Okay, what about, like, my data?
[79:54.58]Mastery level.
[79:55.34]Okay.
[80:01.12]Quest list.
[80:02.10]Accepted.
[80:02.42]Not ordered.
[80:03.24]Not ordered.
[80:07.17]okay so I gotta like order quests I guess right mushroom collections like an encyclopedia catalog of shit the bible throwing mushrooms alright it's just like the okay alright uh I gotta get quests but we'll do that on the next tower because I'm gonna get to the next spot don't worry I guess I think I'm gonna get to the next part of this game
[80:32.77]Oh wait, that's a creature!
[80:33.89]Come here.
[80:36.43]Restores HP?
[80:38.03]Store it?
[80:38.89]God, I'm gonna be eating rats?
[80:42.15]That sounds a little fuckin' weird.
[80:43.43]Okay, is there like a landmine?
[80:48.91]What the hell is that?
[80:50.41]No.
[80:50.95]Oil for R&D.
[80:51.62]Ooh!
[80:59.76]Frog.
[81:04.10]Coins.
[81:04.32]They're pretty generous with the coins, it seems.
[81:11.94]What the fuck was that?
[81:24.29]The game is getting louder.
[81:44.88]Come on, really?
[81:46.33]I'm so screwed.
[81:46.97]Get back up.
[81:49.31]Get back up!
[81:51.01]Get back up here!
[81:57.25]Oh my god, they're just chasing after me.
[81:59.09]They can do the same damn thing.
[82:03.98]I can do like a sprinting kick.
[82:05.20]Hold on, I got a guy by himself.
[82:07.20]Eat it!
[82:29.63]They're killing each other, thankfully.
[82:34.94]The stagger is so intense.
[82:41.64]How do I change targets?
[82:52.97]I don't think I can cycle through targets.
[82:54.90]That's kind of bad.
[83:08.86]Anybody know how to cycle targets?
[83:14.33]Okay.
[83:33.13]It's D-pad to change targets?
[83:34.63]Oh boy, that kinda sucks.
[83:39.32]We're okay.
[83:39.86]We're fine.
[83:41.59]We also have food.
[83:48.99]Eat the rat too.
[83:49.85]A lot of people died over there.
[83:54.25]Nobody dropped anything?
[84:07.38]At least I have some research and development shit.
[84:14.34]Hold on.
[84:16.74]Okay, yeah, it is.
[84:17.46]No, it's not.
[84:20.39]Is it just that one guy down there?
[84:25.27]I can't really tell.
[84:27.01]There's a mushroom up there.
[84:44.69]Give me something give me something Well, it's a grenade I was just ate the grenade I
[85:12.87]That was pretty... I almost ate that grenade.
[85:14.69]That probably would have been terrible.
[85:15.75]I think they're all dead.
[85:21.54]What is this?
[85:28.20]Doom shroom.
[85:29.20]Deadly poison.
[85:30.04]I don't think I want to eat that.
[85:33.81]Just eat it?
[85:34.41]No!
[85:40.31]Anybody else down there?
[85:41.45]I'm scared.
[85:43.21]Oil.
[85:55.04]Cook and eat the grenade.
[85:57.56]And then just explode.
[86:07.15]Anything else?
[86:09.19]I can go up top still.
[86:10.21]I can go up top.
[86:11.17]Ah, wait.
[86:11.55]I think I see something down here.
[86:12.47]Yeah, there's something down here.
[86:13.35]But there's also probably a guy right here.
[86:15.67]Nope.
[86:16.86]Ah.
[86:18.08]Where are you?
[86:20.50]Ah.
[86:23.22]Stomp.
[86:47.43]Anybody else?
[86:49.79]Combat pickaxe.
[86:50.98]Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[86:52.28]Somebody's still shooting in there.
[86:56.18]Let's move that.
[86:57.58]Pretty cool.
[86:58.08]People are just fighting.
[87:00.54]I hear, like, just random noises.
[87:01.86]They're just killing each other in here.
[87:04.73]More leg armor.
[87:15.81]Who's just fighting?
[87:17.99]Oh, they're down here.
[87:18.69]What the hell are they doing?
[87:23.29]I was trying to do, like, a jumping attack there.
[87:27.79]It didn't give me an option.
[87:33.09]Blueprint.
[87:35.70]Ooh, blueprint.
[87:38.18]I hear a frog, too.
[87:40.26]Come on, get down here.
[87:50.89]You died like five times.
[88:07.32]Don't break my pants.
[88:08.26]I'm gonna shit my pants in a second.
[88:09.72]Next time I get into one of those situations where a huge group of enemies are, I'm just gonna throw a grenade.
[88:21.32]At least I'm going to be able to make something when I go back.
[88:25.69]That's the theory at least.
[88:30.05]I'm going to fucking crush this guy.
[88:31.61]Come on over here.
[88:36.37]I wonder what this EX move is.
[88:37.53]That was awesome.
[88:43.06]Die!
[88:48.50]Okay, those EX moves are actually really cool.
[88:51.96]Throw a boom shroom?
[88:55.22]If we have an opportunity, I will.
[88:56.68]There's more than one enemy.
[88:57.52]That's all I can do.
[88:59.68]Have I heard the rats of YMCA mix up?
[89:01.64]I actually have.
[89:12.03]Really?
[89:27.39]Let her rest for a second.
[89:28.81]Right into it.
[89:29.99]What?
[89:30.25]That didn't stagger?
[89:30.76]I thought that was going to stagger for sure.
[89:40.52]Sleep?
[89:41.16]I'll just take it to sell it.
[89:43.50]I'm not really sure what it even does.
[89:53.11]Frog.
[90:01.49]Can't really grab this ledge, can I?
[90:03.09]I hear one of those freak shows.
[90:04.31]The guys with the little heads.
[90:11.18]Come on.
[90:13.12]Climb it.
[90:24.48]No, I don't want to EX this.
[90:25.57]This guy's... I actually fucking... My ship broken now.
[90:35.91]I wasted health there for no reason.
[90:37.28]I'm going to heal.
[90:38.72]I'm going to be at full health.
[90:42.04]Close to it.
[90:43.80]I'm going to turn down the sound a little bit.
[90:54.86]It's a little loud for me right now.
[90:58.00]Hopefully it's not killing your guys' eardrums.
[91:00.14]I just don't want to heal them.
[91:00.92]I don't.
[91:11.48]Well, this would be interesting if I can do this.
[91:14.94]I guess I can.
[91:18.14]Oh, there's a stamp.
[91:18.78]I don't think I even have any stamps, do I?
[91:23.54]Topless stream.
[91:24.30]Yeah, I'm a topless streamer now.
[91:27.98]Oh.
[91:30.82]Oh, I can't use it.
[91:32.46]Strength 25?
[91:33.74]I'm almost out of inventory space.
[91:39.10]Do I even have any stamps?
[91:39.90]I don't think I even got any stamps.
[91:46.77]Shit.
[91:48.29]If I got a Running Star, I can get that.
[92:00.32]Another explosion shroom.
[92:07.16]You don't need stamps to use it?
[92:08.35]Let's use it.
[92:15.52]There's two ways to go here.
[92:16.52]I'm gonna use it.
[92:21.27]I thought like the stamp machine was part of the uh... You had to collect them before you could use it.
[92:26.81]Alright, let's do a rock band.
[92:42.90]What is the purpose of these machines?
[92:48.27]Oh, you just stamp them on each level?
[92:49.92]I get it.
[92:50.44]Okay.
[92:54.38]Uh, what else?
[92:54.78]Anything else down here?
[92:55.72]Oh, yep.
[93:03.36]Shit, I'm out of space.
[93:04.54]Uh... Actually, let me put some of these clothes on.
[93:12.48]Put the hat on.
[93:13.18]I already have pants on.
[93:15.64]Do I have a... Put this on, too.
[93:18.84]But it's still in my inventory, technically, isn't it?
[93:22.86]Um... Get rid of this.
[93:30.72]I don't want that anymore.
[93:31.84]I kind of want to... Materials.
[93:34.74]Oh, where's the illusory walls?
[93:50.49]Do those exist in this game?
[93:55.17]If I failed that, I would need to close the stream.
[93:57.29]I mean, they're kind of impossible to fail.
[93:59.05]I say that now.
[94:00.95]Just wait till I fail it, like, in fucking ten minutes on the next one.
[94:12.88]Nah, I'm not- I'm fighting you down here.
[94:13.98]I'm down here.
[94:20.50]Oh, that didn't really hurt you at all, did it?
[94:23.08]Gotta keep her away from him.
[94:31.72]Shit, that non-stagger punch.
[94:33.26]Fuck me.
[94:33.92]Die!
[94:36.34]Okay, there we go.
[94:43.81]Dude, give me that pickaxe.
[94:51.29]This thing does so much damage.
[95:02.76]Circle straight instead of rolling back.
[95:06.88]I guess it's just my playing Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
[95:10.20]I'm trying to like dodge to the left and dodge around him kind of like back stabs.
[95:14.34]It's a habit that's gonna be really hard to break but it hasn't really got me in that much trouble so far.
[95:24.17]This looks like a dangerous electricity room.
[95:29.96]Cone?
[95:30.32]No, I don't want the cone.
[95:36.30]Gate closed.
[95:37.28]Both the gates closed.
[95:40.18]Okay.
[95:43.26]Oh, boom machine.
[95:44.32]Boom, boom, boom.
[95:47.25]Fuck you.
[95:48.75]Do it again.
[95:52.13]Eat shit.
[95:54.09]Oh, okay.
[95:54.51]Good.
[95:54.99]Wow.
[95:55.83]How useful.
[96:04.71]Thank God.
[96:13.11]Alright, that's cool.
[96:16.67]Two more.
[96:17.09]I'm gonna hit these guys with that shit.
[96:29.16]crit tool.
[96:32.15]Oh, it's broken though.
[96:33.27]Not good.
[96:33.73]Alright, getting the hang of it.
[96:48.12]He used boom shroom on the slowest, weakest people in the game.
[96:50.64]Well, there was like six of them.
[96:51.84]I wanted to like do it.
[97:01.35]I panicked.
[97:03.11]It's alright.
[97:03.79]It's okay.
[97:04.45]It's only the second level.
[97:08.42]I can cook shit in here, I'm assuming.
[97:11.34]Let's try that.
[97:12.94]I have a frog to cook.
[97:13.88]What does this mushroom do?
[97:23.23]Oh, there's this thing.
[97:28.02]Sprinting an X is a dropkick, but I haven't really used it at all.
[97:32.07]Can I cook this?
[97:34.55]Not in the right spot.
[97:38.69]Maybe that doesn't do anything?
[97:43.20]I guess this thing can't be cooked.
[97:44.78]What about this one?
[97:49.70]I guess not.
[97:52.84]I'm on fucking fire!
[97:54.02]Are you kidding me?
[97:58.87]Come on.
[98:00.91]That tiny little fire.
[98:03.43]In real life, I could stomp on that.
[98:05.69]You know what?
[98:06.03]I could lie down in that fire and I would be fine.
[98:18.92]Stop missing?
[98:19.72]How was I missing?
[98:22.12]I was not missing on that fire.
[98:25.04]Not a fucking chance.
[98:27.48]Okay, I can do it on this one.
[98:37.67]Prove it.
[98:38.47]That fire was tiny.
[98:42.29]Hey, look at this.
[98:43.91]The way up.
[98:52.21]I was not missing that fire.
[98:55.32]I was doing the same exact thing as the fire in the pub world.
[99:05.44]Alright, let's keep going.
[99:10.00]Thank you, SuperBruce1991, for the two months.

[100:02.72]What does that mean?
[100:05.67]JonTron stream.
[100:07.90]Never Trust Purple, thank you for the 500 bits and the 1,000 bits.
[100:11.48]I hope someone turns on the stream right now with no context of a naked, mean-eating frog with a cone on his head.
[100:19.73]Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[100:21.79]Let's keep going.
[100:24.43]I killed the Scratch Tuber?
[100:31.92]New quests have been unlocked.
[100:32.88]I need to find an elevator.
[100:38.45]Kind of need to go down.
[100:39.25]There's a new enemy here.
[100:41.19]People... Well, that's great.
[100:42.53]New enemy.
[100:43.05]Hmm...
[101:10.72]MK1.
[101:11.56]There's a guy right there.
[101:13.98]Alright, come here, you.
[101:14.58]I don't know what you do, but we'll find out.
[101:20.68]Shoots out those things.
[101:26.58]Not too awful, but I don't really want to get that close.
[101:32.81]Now's the time to go in.
[101:52.83]Damn, how do you change targets?
[101:55.05]Nothing seems to be doing it.
[101:56.17]That's a new move, though.
[101:57.53]Wait for him to do it again.
[102:01.61]Holy shit, that's a lot of damage.
[102:02.67]Cool!
[102:19.63]I unlocked a new move with fists.
[102:22.71]The super haymaker, I guess, is R1 and L1.
[102:26.03]Up on the D-pad?
[102:27.31]I tried that.
[102:27.77]Maybe I didn't.
[102:35.70]I really need an elevator.
[102:40.72]No, these are not as broken.
[102:41.94]I'm just going to use them.
[102:44.07]What the hell is going on here?
[102:49.34]Alright, I fell down.
[102:51.84]Subway.
[102:52.32]New blueprint.
[102:58.23]Shit.
[102:59.63]Get rid of the... I don't know.
[103:03.23]Get rid of the hat.
[103:08.68]That looked like a good blueprint, maybe.
[103:10.36]I desperately need to go in an elevator.
[103:12.74]There probably was one downstairs and I just didn't find it.
[103:22.26]There right something over there That's why I fell down right yeah, okay, let's go Crazy lady
[103:57.76]She takes a lot of damage.
[103:59.32]At least I get a weapon.
[104:02.98]Shit, I gotta get rid of these pants.
[104:20.35]At least I have a weapon again.
[104:26.50]Who's better, Uncle Death or Coach Frank?
[104:28.52]Uncle Death.
[104:29.02]I don't have an L1 or armor.
[104:41.55]Actually, no.
[104:42.07]Ah, shit.
[104:42.55]Well, I don't know how he didn't hit me with that, but I'll take it.
[104:50.94]Yummy.
[104:52.20]Ooh, a frog.
[104:58.69]Shit.
[105:00.41]Oh, well.
[105:01.63]Alright.
[105:03.56]Guys, stomped him.
[105:07.38]Okay, I bought like in-game currency, right?
[105:09.30]I'm gonna like expand my backpack.
[105:16.06]Shit.
[105:16.92]Alright, where's the expand my backpack?
[105:21.87]Because I have a bunch of shit that I've... You know what?
[105:23.27]I'm gonna get rid of one of these stupid lethal poison...
[105:27.52]Just toss it.
[105:33.95]I'm gonna blueprint.
[105:34.61]I'd rather take a blueprint than a mushroom I'm not gonna use.
[105:38.73]Tear gas.
[105:39.31]And this will be here, I think, right?
[105:43.43]Just my stash, okay.
[105:46.46]Oh.
[105:51.75]Eat it?
[105:52.09]No, I haven't died yet in the game.
[105:55.15]Except for the tutorial where you're supposed to die.
[105:57.63]I don't want to eat a poison mushroom and just fucking die.
[105:59.91]And then have to go back and start this again.
[106:09.74]Well, you sure are special, aren't ya?
[106:16.99]Stun me with your stinger.
[106:29.98]That did a lot of damage.
[106:37.26]Uh, eat this.
[106:37.84]Shit!
[106:38.35]I wanted to shoot it again, not do that.
[107:06.71]Oh my god, up on the d-pad is like, I think might be the worst possible way to switch.
[107:11.36]You have to take your hand off the movement button.
[107:36.22]Get away for a second so I can recharge my ship.
[107:38.78]Ah!
[107:39.26]Okay.
[108:06.49]We're fine.
[108:10.02]More than one enemy is tough with this.
[108:11.38]Yeah, I just... Up on the D-pad to change targets.
[108:15.04]You know what I mean?
[108:18.98]It's a little... Because you have to take your finger off of the left stick.
[108:24.69]I don't like it.
[108:26.79]But I guess you just don't lock on when there's that many people, apparently.
[108:29.65]That's the way to solve that problem.
[108:34.81]No, I'm out of, uh... I'm out of healing.
[108:45.60]Box right there.
[108:48.36]Another blueprint.
[108:52.54]At least I have room.
[108:55.06]Thank goodness!
[108:56.78]What is that?
[109:14.03]Elevator, we're saved!
[109:17.15]We are saved.
[109:21.21]Haha!
[109:23.37]Use your right thumb to press it?
[109:27.55]What?
[109:27.75]Hold on, so you want me to take my right thumb and move it across and hit up on the d-pad.
[109:35.67]I can't think of anything less intuitive than doing that.
[109:43.50]Yeah, let's go back.
[109:44.14]I'm paying money.
[109:44.64]Alright, uh, waiting room.
[109:47.49]How much experience do I have?
[109:59.32]Right index finger, like... Use your nose?
[110:15.55]Let's see, alright, third floor.
[110:19.17]I'm gonna get a decal, don't worry, I will.
[110:23.09]Left index finger on D-pad.
[110:25.44]Middle and ring on L1, L2.
[110:29.18]Am I playing, like, Street Fighter, or am I playing a game with analog sticks?
[110:38.57]Alright, we got it, we're good.
[110:49.11]Garo, Garo.
[110:55.29]Okay.
[110:58.09]Cool.
[110:58.97]$20,000?
[111:00.67]Just joins the game, good.
[111:03.10]Uh, yeah.
[111:05.06]So far.
[111:05.50]For what it's worth.
[111:07.58]Okay, um... So, here's something I don't understand.
[111:19.82]I can only do out of five?
[111:23.52]Didn't I need 25 strength or something?
[111:25.28]How do I get... Oh, okay.
[111:26.54]There it is.
[111:26.86]Yeah.
[111:27.66]So it's increasing my strength by... Like five points.
[111:32.12]Okay.
[111:32.87]Well, I definitely want a max HP.
[111:41.67]And we'll do some vitality and luck.
[111:46.79]Alright.
[111:46.99]Now I can use that sword.
[111:51.14]What did I download from?
[111:51.88]It is on PlayStation 4 only.
[111:53.58]So now I can use that sword.
[112:05.40]You got a car today?
[112:06.18]Well, congratulations, dude.
[112:07.18]Hope you drive it around and have lots of fun.
[112:13.12]18.
[112:14.18]Can't do that.
[112:14.76]Alright.
[112:16.13]Let me go into the fountain.
[112:19.57]Need to make it to floor 10 to upgrade.
[112:21.17]Alright, well let's give the blueprints to this guy and see what the hell these things are.
[112:30.98]One dexterity, but don't tell anyone you leveled that up.
[112:32.88]Did I?
[112:33.72]Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[112:35.22]So is that.
[112:35.70]So is that.
[112:51.11]Alright, let's see.
[112:52.39]Research and development.
[112:55.43]How much does it cost?
[112:57.67]Cotton.
[112:59.19]Waste oil, I have two.
[113:01.05]I can make this.
[113:04.51]How long does it take?
[113:08.92]One second.
[113:11.10]Or is that one minute?
[113:12.32]I'm not sure.
[113:12.78]There's a lot of zeros there.
[113:15.70]No cotton.
[113:16.28]Okay.
[113:18.30]Okay.
[113:20.83]What the hell does that even mean?
[113:24.83]Is it one hour, one minute, one second?
[113:27.74]I don't understand.
[113:39.24]One million years.
[113:40.20]Alright, I gotta take a pee break.
[113:47.08]Get another coffee and we'll keep going.
[113:48.89]Be right back.
[113:50.31]Don't go anywhere.
[113:51.87]Unless you want to go somewhere.
[113:53.25]You go ahead, but I'll be right back.
[114:06.97]Listen up.
[117:25.62]Okay.
[117:27.80]Hey, the research and development finished.
[117:29.26]That's good.
[117:37.93]So now, how much does it cost?
[117:39.09]$965!
[117:39.11]Well, let's just buy it.
[117:42.29]Why not?
[117:42.73]Do I have to make another one, or is it
[117:56.50]Uh.
[117:57.38]What?
[117:57.80]Plus one?
[118:01.93]Okay.
[118:03.51]If I develop it again, does that... Kind of confused, but whatever.
[118:12.65]I need to store this shit.
[118:14.01]Where's my little storage unit?
[118:23.35]Where's the bank?
[118:25.60]It's right there.
[118:29.26]Put these materials in here.
[118:39.35]You don't have to make another one?
[118:40.29]Developing it again improves the shop version.
[118:42.59]Okay.
[118:49.31]There we go.
[118:52.51]Now I have some more room.
[118:53.37]I can equip this.
[118:55.13]Let's see what the moveset is for the sword.
[119:09.80]So this is still a one-handed weapon, huh?
[119:11.90]This thing is crazy.
[119:12.76]Do you see how much damage that was going to do?
[119:17.62]This thing is fucking awesome.
[119:20.06]I'm going to be so sad when this breaks.
[119:21.56]I'm not going to use it until we need it.
[119:24.88]Alright.
[119:26.44]Decals.
[119:27.78]Decals.
[119:29.38]Or is it this lady, right?
[119:30.30]Frog lady?
[119:34.94]Oh, how I've been waiting for you, fellow believer in the power of the mushroom.
[119:39.54]Increase attack and defense by 30% when you're at 15% or below.
[119:43.52]Okay.
[119:44.80]Falling damage, who cares?
[119:47.60]Rate at which stamina decreases during dodge goes down.
[119:49.64]That is amazing.
[119:51.08]Attack.
[119:52.78]3% of damage dealt.
[119:57.62]This one has a discount?
[120:02.56]I think I'm going to have to take the gymnastics one.
[120:09.27]Yeah.
[120:10.71]That's just too good.
[120:11.49]I'm gonna take the gymnast.
[120:19.48]Decal!
[120:20.02]Okay, change decal.
[120:28.70]Put it on.
[120:31.92]It's actually like a tattoo on your body.
[120:33.87]That's funny.
[120:39.21]Without rush rooms, there is no glory.
[120:41.07]There is nothing.
[120:41.83]There is no love.
[120:42.59]Nothing makes sense.
[120:43.75]Let's see how much that changes it.
[120:50.14]Okay, it looks like I can dodge six times now instead of, what, four or five?
[120:52.60]Alright.
[120:55.32]Oh, where are the quests?
[120:57.05]I'm just going to go back here.
[120:57.89]Let's see.
[120:58.69]I haven't even gone here yet.
[121:09.19]Let's talk to this guy.
[121:15.79]Okay.
[121:23.02]Well, thanks for the tip.
[121:25.34]Mother... Let's see what this thing is.
[121:29.04]Tower of Barbs.
[121:30.64]Oh, you just play music.
[121:32.94]Wait, what the hell is going on?
[121:37.23]Uh...
[121:39.82]These are little movies?
[121:40.36]Thank you for listening to this voice guidance system.
[121:43.58]Let us embark on a journey of discovery about the many wonders of the Tower of Barbs.
[121:50.28]The Tower of Barb is located on the tiny... I think we already, yeah, these are just, whatever, gives a shit.
[121:57.47]Uh, came in a lady, you're the quest lady, right?
[122:01.95]Huh?
[122:03.01]Oh, mm, I really don't know anything, sorry!
[122:09.67]Alright.
[122:10.33]Difficulty one.
[122:11.41]Difficulty two.
[122:12.30]I guess I have to do these.
[122:12.98]Difficulty one.
[122:14.94]Defeat ten screamers.
[122:18.74]Defeat a hater.
[122:21.20]Defeat scratch.
[122:22.12]Scratch tuber.
[122:23.16]Defeat five enemies using gore-tastic.
[122:28.97]Capture frog.
[122:30.13]I get a golden frog?
[122:33.05]Taking this quest.
[122:36.06]How many can I have at the same time?
[122:39.57]Collect some boom shrooms.
[122:42.63]I mean, defeat... Screamer times 10 in Ikigara.
[122:46.65]Isn't that the first area?
[122:55.69]I gotta kill people with a buzzsaw.
[122:57.06]And doing any other damage will screw it over.
[123:01.10]Climb from Ikaraga to Umercho with no armor.
[123:08.00]Well, I guess I'll just take this one.
[123:12.15]Should I just take them all?
[123:12.87]I mean, what's the purpose of not having them all?
[123:19.12]I don't think it does anything bad to not have them, right?
[123:22.86]We can have ten active quests.
[123:24.28]Whatever, let's take them all.
[123:41.95]I don't have any other quests available, so I'm just going to take as many of these as we can.
[123:46.23]Use hammer to defeat all enemies?
[123:48.01]No.
[123:48.31]No.
[123:50.53]Collect boom shrooms?
[123:52.11]I mean, whatever.
[123:52.65]I'll just take these ones.
[123:56.89]I mean, whatever.
[123:57.91]It's not like... There's only ten to take, so whatever.
[124:01.19]What was the last thing up here?
[124:05.03]It's like a radio?
[124:15.85]No, it's just like the sound in here.
[124:17.19]Okay, let's go back.
[124:20.52]That's cool.
[124:22.46]Alright, I got my gymnast.
[124:33.66]I'm ready to go back to the tower.
[124:42.28]I think that's all I can really do.
[124:45.01]Sides.
[124:46.09]Yeah.
[124:46.61]Do I get my box?
[124:48.15]No.
[124:50.25]No box.
[124:55.65]Cost more and more money to go higher up, huh?
[125:06.50]Well, let's keep going.
[125:07.30]Let's try not to die.
[125:10.62]I have not died yet, no.
[125:13.46]Not yet.
[125:21.39]The only other real Suda51 grasshopper game that I really cared about was No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2.
[125:28.05]Buy more storage bag slots?
[125:29.99]Expand bag... Eh, whatever.
[125:31.73]We'll go back and do it again.
[125:34.37]Hey, this time at least I didn't forget to put on the decal.
[125:40.75]Under DH service.
[125:43.21]Convert... Expand storage.
[125:45.43]Storage chest.
[125:50.11]Currency details, use express pass.
[125:54.82]Well, I can't do my... That's the storage.
[125:58.22]That's not the... That's not my backpack.
[126:03.91]This looks a lot like No More Heroes.
[126:04.95]It kind of does.
[126:05.35]It has the same feel to it.
[126:07.63]No More Heroes was a little bit more, I think, on the outrageous scale, though.
[126:17.94]Somebody's sprinting.
[126:20.93]Oh, you have a gun, don't you?
[126:27.25]Come here.
[126:36.72]Money, money, money.
[126:38.16]Fireworks launcher?
[126:40.86]Sure, why not?
[126:43.26]Can I have it in one hand?
[126:44.24]I can't have it in one hand.
[126:46.32]Cool.
[126:51.49]Does that decal thing stay on the bottom?
[126:53.53]I'm kind of hoping he could not have it to be sitting there.
[126:56.40]Ah!
[127:01.32]He's waiting for you.
[127:17.69]Another iron hammer.
[127:18.55]I will replace this one.
[127:34.09]Lollipop chainsaw was fun.
[127:38.30]I actually never played lollipop chainsaw I Wait
[127:46.52]Well, I think this is a boss.
[127:48.74]If I were to guess.
[127:52.02]Somebody just asked, is there a boss?
[127:53.55]Are there bosses in this game?
[127:54.55]Well, maybe we should take out the actual weapon for this.
[127:56.83]He's got a lot of health.
[128:19.42]Well, heck, I can't.
[128:20.24]Well, we're going to utilize this as much as we can.
[128:32.26]Ooh, that's a long stacker.
[128:39.42]Oh, why the hell can I not... What?
[128:43.37]I want to do a charge-up move.
[128:56.33]Did you say come out coward?
[128:57.35]I'm like right in front of you, dude.
[128:58.77]Come out coward.
[129:12.47]What the fuck was I?
[129:13.21]Why was I just standing there?
[129:15.00]What was that?
[129:16.64]Apparently I used my EX.
[129:18.16]I was out of this, uh...
[129:26.23]There's a break.
[129:27.01]Whoa!
[129:27.57]That did a lot of damage.
[129:28.41]Okay, I'm going to be smart here.
[129:37.32]You can't hide from me.
[129:41.04]This thing's going to break at the last swing.
[129:44.38]You can't hide from me.
[129:56.95]I have one more hit and I'm like dead.
[130:05.95]No!
[130:09.21]I got so greedy!
[130:13.51]Fuck!
[130:19.46]I just got, like, so greedy there.
[130:21.08]I didn't have enough stamina to swing a third time.
[130:22.86]That was so easy, too.
[130:25.26]Fuck, that was the first death.
[130:30.57]I'm sorry.
[130:32.47]Let me introduce myself.
[130:34.19]I am in charge of insurance sales in the Tower of Barbs.
[130:37.79]My name is Kiwako Seto, and I work for Direct Hell Insurance.
[130:42.67]No, I've never seen this before Death insurance?
[131:07.61]Okay, got a new area.
[131:09.31]Oh, but... Oh, for the price of just one in-game currency!
[131:13.52]Okay.
[131:35.20]Well, I already bought in-game currency.
[131:37.30]And he's gonna bring me back to life right here?
[131:39.36]What?
[131:39.46]Right in front of him?
[131:40.36]What are you thinking?
[132:07.06]Alright, okay.
[132:10.94]I got him.
[132:14.28]Okay, well.
[132:15.92]I guess when you die for the first time, they bring you back automatically for free.
[132:20.28]Rare metal.
[132:25.22]Hey, got him first try.
[132:30.98]What hand is that in?
[132:31.78]What?
[132:38.01]Let's put, just have both of them.
[132:42.53]Alright, well, that's what happens when you die.
[132:44.97]So here's the thing.
[132:47.70]When you die, in this game, you can come back to life for in-game currency, or you go back to the beginning and have to start over and lose all your stuff.
[132:58.96]But, you know.
[133:01.20]Whatever.
[133:01.56]Let's keep going.
[133:09.73]Death count, zero.
[133:10.65]No, I technically didn't die, right?
[133:13.71]Technically.
[133:15.93]I just got too greedy.
[133:17.05]That was just stupid of me.
[133:24.06]Next level.
[133:25.78]Level four.
[133:28.67]You can buy back with coins, too.
[133:33.99]That's cool, then.
[133:38.58]Or you can just use the elevator.
[133:39.58]Yeah, but I think you lose the stuff you collected.
[133:43.38]This is free to play.
[133:49.70]Free to play on PlayStation 4 only.
[133:56.51]Let me close my door.
[133:57.35]Oh boy, I'm going to pull my whole desk down.
[134:04.95]It's getting cold in here.
[134:08.41]Senpai, I just sent you a super important text right now.
[134:11.61]Be sure to read it.
[134:13.65]Super important text, okay.
[134:18.94]Try online mode.
[134:31.05]Ticket machine?
[134:31.89]Alright, well, whatever you say, buddy.
[134:38.38]Whatever you say.
[134:45.54]Deadly poison.
[134:46.40]Take it.
[134:48.94]He called you to say he texted you.
[134:50.48]Yeah, that's... A little needy, man.
[134:53.90]He's getting a little too needy for me.
[134:57.98]Is somebody behind me or above me?
[134:59.06]Above me.
[135:01.26]Probably above me.
[135:02.10]Let's go kick some ass.
[135:05.55]I need more grenades.
[135:07.89]I need to grab more grenades.
[135:10.71]Hold these guys back here.
[135:11.67]Well, okay, they came through this way.
[135:16.02]I'm gonna get off the lock on him.
[135:44.15]Oh, boy.
[135:45.65]Alright, so how come when I hold down triangle and I'm trying to do this super move, it just doesn't do it?
[135:49.49]I have one.
[135:50.53]Do I need two for this weapon?
[135:52.77]I don't understand why it's not happening.
[135:53.99]I keep trying to do it.
[135:54.69]Okay, I have two now.
[135:57.59]Alright, so I guess you have to, for certain, left hand and right hand or something like that?
[136:01.15]That's kind of weird.
[136:08.73]Because when I have one, it seems to light up my left hand.
[136:11.05]Is that because I have... Okay.
[136:14.13]Attack up.
[136:26.92]Don't get beaten by Cone Man, I know.
[136:28.56]I don't have any... I think I have stuff in my inventory.
[136:31.52]Nope.
[136:31.94]Just have a helmet.
[136:34.00]Only a helmet.
[136:35.28]We have one helmet remaining.
[136:36.55]We might have to turn around and go back downstairs.
[136:46.68]One guy on the left.
[136:57.17]Oh, I just... Okay, I just could have done it.
[136:58.95]I just could have done a gore-tastic move, but I just kept on smashing him.
[137:02.83]Let's see if I can get it on this one.
[137:05.20]I just couldn't see him around the corner there.
[137:12.64]What was that turnaround?
[137:14.00]What was that glitchy-ass, like...
[137:27.45]Didn't have enough time.
[137:28.19]Give me a health potion.
[137:43.01]Need health.
[137:51.39]Need health.
[137:52.05]Bad!
[137:55.87]What?
[137:57.27]What?
[137:59.59]That hurt me that much?
[138:03.72]What am I doing?
[138:04.22]I can just go this way.
[138:06.44]That one doesn't hurt, but doing a big jump from the side hurts.
[138:08.88]Okay, well.
[138:10.92]I'm just trying to save time by having to go back all the way here.
[138:25.01]Just keep going.
[138:28.73]I don't know if that doesn't hurt me though.
[138:41.27]Where are you running to, lady?
[138:56.47]200 weapon.
[138:56.99]Yeah, it's broken, so I'm gonna have to take something.
[138:58.87]Come on, give me health.
[139:03.76]I don't want to eat any of these dumb poison mushrooms.
[139:08.94]I thought there was a person in front of me.
[139:16.36]Let's keep going this way.
[139:20.32]That feeling when the kid from The Last Guardian has stronger legs than you.
[139:25.18]There's another stamp, but I want to kill this person first.
[139:28.24]They're not wrapping around me, are they?
[139:35.01]Come on.
[139:37.03]Let's go!
[139:37.95]Get over here.
[139:43.05]One of those stupid, slow, alien people.
[139:45.19]Shocker!
[139:53.22]Oh, I have hunting tubers.
[139:54.50]That's part of the quest.
[139:55.92]Did he drop anything?
[139:57.38]No.
[140:01.32]Oh, there's a stamp machine.
[140:04.41]Stamp it!
[140:04.81]Uh-oh, I have two things to press.
[140:17.10]Flawless stamp.
[140:24.09]That's probably going to get much more difficult as time goes along.
[140:26.41]I can probably get up there.
[140:36.67]Give me the shit.
[140:46.72]I'm going to get like overwhelmed here, I can assume.
[140:53.26]Him again!
[140:53.68]Oh, come on.
[140:56.70]Bullshit.
[140:59.16]Oh, your reach is killing me, buddy.
[141:05.61]With a regular hammer.
[141:11.31]Can't have these two equipped at the same time, unfortunately.
[141:25.11]Are the floors randomized?
[141:26.09]I actually don't know.
[141:27.64]They might be.
[141:28.02]I feel like this is here for a reason, but then again, maybe not.
[141:50.86]Hello?
[141:58.04]Come on up.
[142:01.60]Come on.
[142:03.46]Put your face right here.
[142:06.54]Get over here, you fucking idiot.
[142:08.18]What are you doing?
[142:09.56]Come here.
[142:12.03]Don't make me have to jump.
[142:13.55]And then you turn and instantly hit me.
[142:15.15]That's not what I wanted.
[142:22.81]Now he's running.
[142:23.49]And that shit's broken.
[142:24.21]Now here they both come.
[142:28.73]Climb up it, please!
[142:35.09]Oh, at least I got the EX off.
[142:47.08]Well!
[142:48.47]There it is.
[142:48.91]Did you drop anything?
[142:50.85]Yes, you did.
[142:53.49]Red hot iron.
[142:57.77]Okay.
[143:02.09]It shoots steam out?
[143:12.26]Iron baa?
[143:13.82]Cool.
[143:18.14]I'm gonna use this till it's out because I'm better with this, I think, than the steam iron.
[143:26.15]Where are you?
[143:26.61]Up top?
[143:27.23]You're gonna drop down behind me, aren't you?
[143:28.67]You're gonna fuck with me that way, game?
[143:41.21]mushroom in here.
[143:45.13]Or is it in here?
[143:45.65]Yeah, where is it?
[144:03.08]No, no attack up.
[144:04.46]I need some health.
[144:08.15]Keep giving me attack mushrooms.
[144:19.00]This used to be a beep stream?
[144:20.02]What do you mean, beep stream?
[144:30.90]I don't have any boom shrooms, and there's like ten people behind her.
[144:34.94]Shit!
[144:54.67]And you're shooting that shit too.
[145:01.13]This thing sucks.
[145:09.93]Ow.
[145:17.49]This is gonna break right when I hit one of these guys too, isn't it?
[145:19.79]Son of a bitch.
[145:22.31]Both of you assholes have the same stupid weapon.
[145:31.51]This thing's gonna break.
[145:40.84]No, sprint and hit him!
[145:41.86]Hit him with the fucking weapon!
[145:50.67]Where's my E?
[145:53.31]Where's my super move?
[145:54.21]Come on!
[145:54.89]I'm, like, spamming this guy.
[145:56.17]Hot dog, man.
[146:02.19]Another fireworks launcher.
[146:03.19]This thing sucks, though.
[146:05.61]I'm not... I don't have any points in dexterity for this weapon.
[146:10.53]Use my poison shrooms?
[146:11.91]What?
[146:13.35]Why would I want to do that?
[146:23.41]Distract him?
[146:26.25]Shit.
[146:28.53]Buzzsaw, knuckles.
[146:29.41]Yeah, give me that for sure.
[146:30.51]This is not gonna be good.
[146:42.12]I don't want to fight you in this tiny corridor.
[146:48.54]Fuck this thing.
[146:49.06]Give me the saw.
[147:05.44]Dead.
[147:07.84]And how about you?
[147:15.48]Still safe.
[147:21.42]Go back and bank what I have.
[147:22.40]I feel like I'm getting close to an elevator.
[147:26.39]Come on.
[147:29.26]Stop this madness.
[147:38.86]Throw the poison shrooms?
[147:40.04]I guess I could do that, but it's scary.
[147:42.82]This is another direction to go in.
[147:51.50]It's going to lock, isn't it?
[147:55.84]That shit's gonna lock on me, and I'm gonna have to fight people.
[147:58.58]Okay.
[147:59.52]Let's lose.
[148:01.02]Let's lose with dignity.
[148:12.85]Oh, what?
[148:15.65]Right when I got the option to hit X, he saw me, apparently.
[148:30.23]Is there another person sitting behind me?
[148:46.78]Break his guard, come on.
[148:52.20]Recharge my stamina.
[149:06.92]At least I can re... Actually, if you don't have to have another slot, you can just put that in.
[149:10.51]Alright, what is... What do we got?
[149:12.59]Better defense?
[149:13.27]Sure.
[149:13.59]Uh, anything else?
[149:23.25]I don't think so.
[149:23.99]Alright, you want to do a dropkick?
[149:29.03]Actually, that's something I need to, like, practice without 135 HP.
[149:31.12]Who's that?
[149:31.66]Is that me?
[149:33.26]It's me!
[149:37.51]It's me!
[149:44.77]Oh shit, you have an iron too, don't you?
[149:53.08]Yeah, I got the better iron.
[149:55.68]My iron's much better than your iron, you son of a bitch!
[150:02.51]Back to my old tricks.
[150:05.65]My old shitty clothes.
[150:11.19]What was in here?
[150:16.39]Nothing?
[150:17.03]Nothing.
[150:22.29]And here's the elevator.
[150:23.09]We made it.
[150:23.39]Alright, is there something that I'm doing wrong with this elevator here?
[150:30.14]The one on the right?
[150:31.96]I haven't been able to really utilize it.
[150:34.38]It opens and then it just closes.
[150:35.94]I feel like I'm missing something with that.
[150:37.18]Let's go refresh.
[150:45.56]Do we wield the irons?
[150:46.44]It's actually not a bad idea.
[150:58.53]Oh, we have a second.
[150:59.81]Thank you, Foxy Turnip, Lor Swole, and Mukow for the subs.
[151:03.77]Mukow is three months.
[151:05.91]Fortress Final Queue, thanks for the ten months in a row.
[151:11.11]Pay-to-play elevator.
[151:13.63]LucyX3, thanks for two months.
[151:15.23]You've been catching up on Sorcery.
[151:16.47]Love it.
[151:16.81]Love your content.
[151:17.44]Well, I'm happy to hear that.
[151:20.28]Sorcery was a ton of fun.
[151:21.20]And we're going to be playing another Steve Jackson game coming up here in the next, like... Like, week.
[151:32.02]Sometimes it happens and you can't fight it.
[151:33.84]And that was one of those times.
[151:34.98]That was one of those times where you just can't fight it.
[151:39.29]But thank you for the two months.
[151:41.09]Killborg.
[151:42.87]Killborg thanks for three months.
[151:44.65]EchoFoxtrot, thank you for the seven months.
[151:47.57]SuperRuice1991, I think I already got you.
[151:49.21]And LalaChan.
[151:49.79]I think I got these guys already.
[151:55.72]PurpleRoseTattoo, thank you for the $5.
[151:57.58]500 bits, too.
[151:59.54]Who's better?
[152:00.02]Okay, I already answered the question, but thank you.
[152:02.42]That was like a puke.
[152:09.96]Yeah, the burp stream is back.
[152:11.44]You got it.
[152:16.84]What else can I do with this guy?
[152:21.49]I guess I could just max out the character as of this point.
[152:25.51]I don't need to point in dexterity, but max out vitality and luck on me.
[152:29.21]Why not?
[152:31.03]It's like I can't do anything else.
[152:39.92]Don't troll poor Jeremy.
[152:41.42]I don't want that item.
[152:50.92]Something's changed.
[152:57.40]Listen to purple?
[152:58.21]What did he say?
[152:58.89]Let me see.
[153:02.41]How long does a jackal spawn usually take?
[153:06.17]Stick around on floor 7 for a while.
[153:07.87]Something cool will happen.
[153:09.95]Stick around on floor 7.
[153:10.91]Are you trying to get me killed?
[153:14.05]Is that what you're saying?
[153:16.32]Are you trying to murder me, Purple?
[153:21.88]Tokyo Death Metro.
[153:24.18]Thank you for playing Let It Die.

[154:27.50]Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, California.
[154:55.77]Are you gonna pick, like, a state?
[154:57.57]You gotta pick your state.
[154:58.63]Uh, should I do Massachusetts?
[155:06.35]Massachusetts hate info.
[155:08.39]Apparently we hate people from Louisiana.
[155:14.10]Well, I'm gonna have to join Team Massachusetts.
[155:21.10]There's so much to do in this game.
[155:22.18]There really is.
[155:23.52]Thank you for registering.
[155:24.51]There's almost too much to do.
[155:25.53]Your special team flag will be put inside your waiting room soon.
[155:29.31]Do them proud.
[155:31.29]You can change your team at no cost, just once.
[155:35.31]But after that, you'll be charged.
[155:38.73]So be warned.
[155:39.75]Louisiana.
[155:40.52]Why?
[155:40.76]Please enjoy Tokyo Death Metro's luxury of backlighting.
[155:44.36]Louisiana and Massachusetts apparently are rivals somehow.
[155:47.12]Oh, and as a special bonus, your first ride is free.
[155:52.02]Head to this ticket machine, the Metrofront, whenever you're ready.
[155:56.67]Let's, uh, jump in a moment.
[156:00.55]Should I do this right now?
[156:01.65]Should I represent Team Massachusetts?
[156:04.27]Wait, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[156:06.69]Looks like store items.
[156:07.69]Let's not be fucking stupid here.

[156:14.69]Excellent.
[156:15.09]Attack coat.
[156:18.77]Hmm.
[156:20.41]Aha!
[156:22.19]same exact one okay well let's let's just like upgrade this one three minutes all these require cotton I haven't seen one cotton so far
[156:49.55]I have a lot of these dumb things that I don't want to use because I don't like them.
[156:59.53]Doesn't he take the blueprint?
[157:01.27]Oh, wait.
[157:01.85]That's extra.
[157:02.89]I'll keep the mushrooms.
[157:09.80]Sell this.
[157:11.24]Sell this.
[157:17.84]And I'll equip that and store the rest.
[157:20.56]Oh, actually, let me sell this one.
[157:27.02]Alright, we're going to store this stuff.
[157:32.94]Florida represent.
[157:35.10]Team Florida.
[157:43.37]Where's the storage?
[157:43.95]I always run by it.
[158:01.00]I'll hold on to this.
[158:03.29]I'll hold on to this just in case I need it for an emergency for some reason.
[158:07.01]I'll put the hat on.
[158:07.81]Two mushrooms are fine.
[158:10.77]Alright, now did somebody say that I could actually increase the storage of my backpack?
[158:15.85]Or is that not possible?
[158:23.38]I feel like they wouldn't let you do that.
[158:27.42]What about decals?
[158:28.22]Do I unlock any more decals or anything?
[158:33.24]Yeah, I can only have one.
[158:35.42]I like that one.
[158:37.01]Mushroom stew?
[158:37.91]$50,000?
[158:37.93]What does that do?
[158:41.87]I don't want to do that right now unless I know what the fuck it does.
[158:44.39]Let me buy mushrooms from her, though.
[158:47.37]What can I?
[158:47.81]No.
[158:48.13]Alright, let's do it.
[159:04.88]Look at Ohio's symbol.
[159:09.16]Well, let's just see what this does.
[159:13.96]Did you raid other people?
[159:19.77]I still don't understand what this is trying to get me to do.
[159:26.69]Yeah.
[159:27.05]Apparently, we're raiding this guy.
[159:31.09]Defense settings.
[159:32.76]Raid cost.
[159:37.23]Alright, look.
[159:39.05]We're raiding this guy.
[159:43.39]Here I come.
[159:45.05]The greasy, bloody, yellow jacket guy with a fucking iron.
[160:01.00]I wonder how menacing I look.
[160:05.38]with my Better Homes and Gardens iron.
[160:13.94]Three, two, one, action!
[160:17.84]Alright, here we go!
[160:20.72]Here we go, time to read.
[160:23.75]Pay the fare from the metro front and you can take the train to go and attack other players' waiting room.
[160:29.03]The other players' fighters will be waiting for you.
[160:30.97]Fight your way through them and invade their waiting room.
[160:34.98]Destroy your target's Buffalo Bank and Splithium tank and plunder the contents.
[160:38.56]Is this just Clash of Clans?
[160:50.23]This is just Clash of Clans.
[160:53.67]Alright.
[160:55.11]I guess I'm in some other guy's room.
[160:57.15]And he has defenses he can put up.
[161:01.27]Yeah, here we are.
[161:03.57]Oh look, watch out!
[161:04.21]One naked guy with a club!
[161:06.67]He's gonna kill me.
[161:15.88]This music, dude.
[161:22.04]What?
[161:22.42]I could've strung there together.
[161:23.78]Did I win?
[161:36.32]Zero?
[161:49.07]Sounds staggering very well.
[161:51.98]Fucking non-staggerable bullshit.
[161:55.00]Alright, take this thing off.
[161:55.76]I'm just blasting her.
[161:57.08]Oh, great.
[161:57.50]They're gonna kill the guy.
[162:05.86]Fucking poison.
[162:06.62]No, no, no, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[162:15.39]Lord.
[162:15.71]I don't even have the guy shooting fireworks at me over here.
[162:23.85]I almost did it.
[162:28.19]Oh, hold on, hold on.
[162:28.80]I'm going to dropkick this guy.
[162:30.12]By popular demand, let's dropkick him.
[162:41.10]I guess it did a lot of damage.
[162:42.06]Let's do it again.
[162:49.04]I've raided his... Alright, let's raid him.
[162:51.38]Quick.
[162:52.42]Smash his machine.
[163:00.07]It's going to take a while.
[163:00.87]Alright.
[163:09.96]Quick, attack his gem factory.
[163:22.14]Alright, I got 16 of his gems.
[163:32.88]Dropkick the machine?
[163:33.94]Alright, let's go for a dropkick.
[163:35.76]This thing didn't give me my soda fast enough.
[163:42.69]I'm gonna get it.
[163:43.34]Hold on.
[163:47.18]Oh, fuck you!
[163:48.68]Yeah!
[163:51.14]Where's my coins?
[163:54.08]Did I already get as many coins as I could out of this thing?
[164:00.19]I'm gonna pick this person up.
[164:08.92]Why am I doing this?
[164:13.84]Huh?
[164:14.36]Do I leave now?
[164:18.49]How do I put this guy down?
[164:19.77]Walk out his front door?
[164:22.13]I don't understand.
[164:24.47]Like... This is his bathroom.
[164:42.24]Take him with you.
[164:42.92]I'm gonna steal one of your bodyguards, dude.
[164:45.62]Let's go back to the train.
[164:56.93]Oh, okay.
[165:01.07]I figured there was something else I could do, but apparently not.
[165:06.37]Take the body back.
[165:07.73]Oh, I have to capture a fighter!
[165:13.12]I actually have to take a guy with me.
[165:17.75]Well, alright.
[165:19.73]Sure, come here.
[165:20.45]I don't think I had to take somebody with me.
[165:30.21]Let's go.
[165:39.80]What does this even achieve?
[165:49.48]Alright, I steal one of your guys, I guess.
[165:57.61]He's on the ground.
[166:05.72]So then I take him back to my facility and I train him to be my guy.
[166:09.09]Right?
[166:21.72]I guess.
[166:24.35]Thank you, uh, Spiteful Crow for the subscription.
[166:27.35]And Foxy Turnip as well.
[166:28.81]Thanks, guy.
[166:30.99]Welcome.
[166:44.61]I love how the fireworks gun actually has fireworks loaded into it, like Roman candles.
[166:49.91]It's in the bathroom?
[166:52.37]My team.
[166:52.99]What is going on?
[166:56.56]Is this like a war going on?
[166:58.20]Alright, versus Michigan?
[167:14.93]Delaware, Georgia.
[167:16.65]Dude, the United States is in all out war right now.
[167:24.53]Alright, let's go to Ohio.
[167:28.67]Ohio is funny looking.
[167:32.43]This is really awkward.
[167:33.33]I want to read this.
[167:48.72]You can ride for free when raiding.
[167:49.96]Players have access to the BC-256 high-tech train.
[167:54.38]Immerse yourself in the clean and pleasant atmosphere of this delightful vehicle.
[167:57.98]Okay.
[168:00.46]Usually a raiding fighter has to wait for a set time before being able to retreat, but DH Express members can withdraw any time they like.
[168:08.30]So if you ever think this opponent is way too strong, or I could take this chance to capture a fighter, then the instant retreat service would be helpful.
[168:16.35]Alright, well he's in the bathroom?
[168:18.17]Why is he in the bathroom?
[168:21.93]Holy shit, he's like tied up and has electrodes in him.
[168:27.65]If other players' fighters who you have captured finish resetting in your restroom, they will then become your own fighters.
[168:35.09]A certain amount of time is required in order to complete resetting captured fighters.
[168:39.29]You'll also harvest some splithium during the reset.
[168:43.17]If you're attacked and your restroom is destroyed,
[168:46.49]Everyone that's captured will return to their original players?
[168:50.23]This is like... What the fuck is... What is going on in this game?
[168:56.49]I'm like locked up.
[168:57.59]You obtain three from... Alright.
[169:03.51]Release him?
[169:04.12]No, I don't want to release him.
[169:06.64]He's currently resetting.
[169:16.08]This is really awkward and weird.
[169:18.74]Well, there's a whole other part of the game that exists.
[169:22.34]What do you say we go back to... What is this now?
[169:29.65]War information to take in.
[169:34.20]Fighter Freezer.
[169:37.71]So these are classes.
[170:08.04]You can now select a fighter in storage to switch with the fighter you are controlling.
[170:12.52]You can send fighters on expeditions to attack other players.
[170:20.69]Ah, God, there's so much going on.
[170:22.81]I kind of want to just, like, kill people in the tower.
[170:30.69]You can equip them with gear.
[170:34.92]If hunters are equipped with gear developed, the durability will not decrease as they fight, however they use other equipment.
[170:47.28]If you see a fighter with a red name, it's a hunter that someone has sent after you.
[170:51.07]Make sure to take revenge against them when you find them.
[170:54.53]Change their title, fight as you no longer, blah blah blah, lots of shit.
[170:58.05]Alright, well let me just look in here then.
[171:03.04]expedition fighter settings select okay this is a dean is an all-arounder and bradley is also an all-arounder can change their names I'm dean right let's go to dean I don't think I can change dean's name
[171:31.01]Well, that's something that I'm going to have to pay attention to later.
[171:33.37]I need more weapons, man.
[171:41.83]Well, let's go.
[171:42.77]Back into the train.
[171:44.09]Back to the elevator.
[171:44.81]Let's keep moving.
[171:46.13]Floor four.
[171:50.03]Let's get to floor five.
[171:51.21]Okay.
[172:00.10]Did I complete The Last Guardian?
[172:01.20]Yeah, I did.
[172:02.82]I beat it last night.
[172:06.78]Hey, The Troll Burger.
[172:07.62]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[172:11.95]Am I going to play Alekhine's Gun on stream?
[172:15.25]I thought about it.
[172:17.89]There's just so many games that have been coming out because it's like the November and December trove of new releases.
[172:28.62]I'm getting raided.
[172:31.11]Raided, like, in the game?
[172:32.01]Like, somebody's, wait, somebody's fighting me?
[172:33.19]Someone's in my base right now?
[172:39.00]Who the fuck is coming at me?
[172:43.28]Somebody's, like, raiding my base.
[172:44.38]Is that what you, is that what you guys are talking about?
[172:49.59]Did I come from this way?
[172:50.37]I forget which way I came from.
[172:54.51]Is it too late to get your 13 goblins back?
[172:58.22]Did I come from this way?
[172:59.20]I don't really, I don't even remember, but whatever.
[173:00.92]Am I gonna fight Toonstruck?
[173:05.84]No, I'm not gonna fight Toonstruck.
[173:10.96]I thought I had that.
[173:11.70]That's dog shit.
[173:13.16]I can't do anything about it.
[173:28.80]Yeah.
[173:31.14]Quit being such a piece of shit.
[173:32.47]You wanna get... Alright, you wanted it?
[173:33.77]Fine.
[173:33.99]Oh, that didn't work.
[173:36.89]I'm trying to dropkick you.
[173:38.09]God, I'm getting fucking destroyed right now.
[173:50.61]The melee range for punching is very, very hard to judge.
[173:56.02]It's a tiny, tiny, tiny range.
[174:03.50]I have plenty of EX, though.
[174:07.08]Just like that, he got raided, yeah.
[174:09.84]It's all good.
[174:12.88]I already came this way, I think.
[174:14.72]Did I?
[174:15.80]Yeah, I remember climbing up here.
[174:19.46]This was an area?
[174:20.10]Yeah, I think I'm going the wrong way.
[174:25.75]Whatever, I'll just grind out experience for a minute.
[174:30.87]Come over here so I can do this to you.
[174:34.40]Yeah, you're right in the balls.
[174:46.31]Oh, fuck you, sir!
[174:52.45]This is a big mobile game.
[175:04.33]It could be construed that way, I guess.
[175:06.37]But it's fun.
[175:08.32]It's fun enough.
[175:09.08]The game's free.
[175:16.90]Was I going the wrong way?
[175:17.74]I must have turned around.
[175:20.18]The one thing I don't really enjoy is the fact that everything's so similar that it's hard for me to tell when I come back to this floor if I'm going the right way.
[175:30.37]I don't think I can remember coming back here.
[175:36.08]Everything is very samey.
[175:39.48]No, I think I did come over here.
[175:46.33]Let's try for a dropkick here.
[175:50.37]No, we're not.
[175:51.49]Never mind.
[175:52.82]Okay.
[176:05.36]I want to do the drop thing that I did on the last guy.
[176:10.46]Use the map?
[176:11.02]Yeah, I think it resets.
[176:12.92]Are you getting poisoned?
[176:27.32]No, of course.
[176:28.18]That one tiny little fire.
[176:35.85]Yeah, I can see it.
[176:36.63]I mean, it doesn't really determine which way I was before.
[176:40.67]I mean, I guess, like, nothing's revealed anymore.
[176:50.03]There's a lot of people.
[176:50.77]Let's poison them.
[177:00.47]Can these guys not be poisoned?
[177:04.58]Fuck the rest of you down this hallway.
[177:05.74]Let's do it again.
[177:18.45]That was pretty cool.
[177:20.19]Did I seriously touch the stupid little fucking fire again?
[177:24.85]That's so stupid.
[177:25.93]Look at this stupid little piece of shit fire.
[177:29.21]Come on.
[177:31.35]Come on.
[177:33.72]That doesn't even need to be there.
[177:36.24]That fire makes no sense.
[177:42.12]Robots plus poison.
[177:43.22]I didn't know if it was just a thing that works on anything.
[177:55.38]Here comes a sprinter.
[178:03.82]Come on, do it.
[178:04.98]Do it.
[178:08.44]Weapon broke right when I use it, really.
[178:09.96]That's not cool.
[178:11.52]Don't stand in the fire again.
[178:12.86]I hate how you can't dodge that.
[178:22.32]That's not fucking cool.
[178:29.62]Why is my heart highlighted every now and again?
[178:31.04]That is stamina.
[178:32.96]So, if I'm swinging too much or moving too much, purple means you are out.
[178:39.19]And you have to stand completely still for four or five seconds. ...
[179:00.73]I... Alright.
[179:02.47]Though, like, after you swing this weapon, you have to stay still for, like, three seconds.
[179:06.69]Or two seconds.
[179:07.63]That's really annoying.
[179:10.23]God, this weapon sucks.
[179:15.59]It just does.
[179:17.47]Ready?
[179:17.89]Ready?
[179:18.07]Watch this.
[179:18.35]Ready?
[179:20.71]That's how long it takes.
[179:22.19]Before you can move again.
[179:25.03]Swing!
[179:25.49]Now you can move.
[179:40.91]I'm so dead here.
[179:46.61]There's a crate over there, though.
[179:57.41]I'm gonna get, like, sniped.
[180:01.47]She's gonna shoot me off this.
[180:02.43]Ready?
[180:02.63]Here he comes.
[180:03.99]Come on, snipe me off.
[180:04.88]Do it.
[180:05.38]You know you want to.
[180:09.30]Oh, please move!
[180:23.11]Run this way.
[180:28.64]Heal?
[180:28.98]I don't have any healing.
[180:31.14]All I have is these attack ups.
[180:33.56]Something over there, though.
[180:42.42]I need that suitcase!
[180:43.24]Let's look in here first.
[180:51.07]Yeah, I'm probably gonna walk into a fire and die.
[180:53.41]I would be surprised if I didn't at this point.
[180:58.47]I need healing though before I die.
[181:00.41]Stupid.
[181:05.24]There's a lot of people down here and I'm gonna die.
[181:12.54]Here we go!
[181:27.97]Here it comes boys and girls, here comes the death!
[181:39.10]Use my consumables?
[181:41.00]I only have one.
[181:41.62]It's just an attack one.
[181:42.56]I didn't want to waste it.
[181:43.80]I was naked.
[181:48.48]Incoming death to level four.
[181:49.82]It's like, if I get hit like three times, I die.
[181:52.18]No.
[181:56.98]Yeah, we're spending the in-game currency.
[181:58.73]We're coming back.
[182:05.73]I get full health, I do.
[182:17.93]Dammit.
[182:34.44]Yeah, keep hitting that guy.
[182:35.42]God damn it.
[182:47.89]What the fuck?
[182:48.75]What?
[182:48.99]Are you trying to tell me I didn't hit that guy right there?
[183:05.08]I fucked!
[183:12.67]Did you drop anything back there?
[183:15.17]I could wrap around here.
[183:21.85]I might as well.
[183:25.49]That's great.
[183:26.13]Apparently there's a person over here.
[183:31.34]Two people, I guess.
[183:56.57]Come here, I get sprayed.
[184:05.29]You want money?
[184:15.20]Uh, give me the hammer, sure.
[184:24.81]Somebody gave me a thousand bits?
[184:25.95]When?
[184:26.57]Where is it?
[184:27.39]How did I miss it?
[184:32.63]I didn't see it pop up.
[184:37.73]I don't even see anything.
[184:39.36]The last thing I see is the troll burger guy.
[184:45.04]Also, I'm trying to concentrate too.
[184:46.60]This is a game where if I don't focus, I'll just die to every enemy.
[184:55.47]Let's just wrap around completely, because this is going to bring us all the way back.
[184:58.51]I'm going to turn around and go that way.
[185:08.32]Mid-boss.
[185:12.56]This used to be a raiding stream.
[185:16.10]I wish I was naked.
[185:23.23]No, it's poison again.
[185:24.23]Shit!
[185:24.45]Ugh!
[185:29.03]Someone donated a billion bits.
[185:31.49]Now, this is back down.
[185:32.31]Okay.
[185:33.49]At least I cleared that.
[185:34.69]Everyone doesn't care about us?
[185:37.99]What?
[185:38.15]What are you talking about?
[185:38.97]Okay, when I look over my other monitor, right now I have no idea what's going on on the screen.
[185:49.97]So, I have to, like, when I can take a break and then read, it was when I can do it.
[186:00.68]Don't worry, I won't miss them.
[186:02.78]Sometimes push alerts doesn't like to work either.
[186:06.84]Alright, well I'm going to go to the right.
[186:09.80]Hopefully I can just skip this guy.
[186:14.88]I'm with that briefcase.
[186:16.02]Let's kill this guy.
[186:16.84]Let's get him.
[186:19.14]You're going to use the iron.
[186:20.34]No, I'm going to use this thing.
[186:22.77]Are you fucking serious?
[186:25.87]Are you serious?
[186:26.53]That is that much damage?
[186:33.17]I felt like from there to there.
[186:34.61]That just murdered me.
[186:36.63]That just absolutely murdered me.
[186:40.88]That's not that far.
[186:45.94]Hey, look.
[186:47.24]1590 bits.
[186:51.86]Thanks a lot, Lala Chan, for the 1590.
[186:53.00]Appreciate it.
[186:53.94]That's about $16.
[186:54.98]Thanks a lot, dude.
[187:03.70]Here we go.
[187:03.96]We're going up again.
[187:04.54]This is full number five.
[187:09.89]Say banana.
[187:12.11]Banana.
[187:16.13]Missed it.
[187:16.73]No, I didn't.
[187:17.31]What are you guys talking about?
[187:20.29]Lala Chan just gave me like $16.
[187:41.54]He said it.
[187:42.42]He said it.
[187:43.32]He said it.
[187:43.82]He gave me 16 bucks.
[187:45.90]Thank you, dude.
[187:46.70]I appreciate it.
[187:51.11]Tell a joke.
[187:54.27]No, this is not a joke stream.
[187:55.41]We're not doing jokes anymore.
[187:56.53]I made that very clear in The Last Guardian stream.
[187:59.81]No more jokes.
[188:09.30]I hear a guy.
[188:12.76]I hear a lot of guys.
[188:13.66]Am I going to die?
[188:21.07]Let's see if there's people down here.
[188:25.13]What?
[188:29.18]Is this a secret slime action?
[188:30.26]The secret slime action is...
[188:41.66]Oh, I just barely missed it.
[188:42.74]Oh well.
[188:45.36]Have a crush on a guy's skull.
[188:48.91]Another attack up.
[188:51.55]Where are all the frogs?
[188:54.17]No more frogs in here anymore.
[189:03.84]No jokes.
[189:05.95]Well, what do you guys want me to say about this game?
[189:07.53]Ready?
[189:07.73]Well, I'll give you a joke.
[189:08.59]Like, oh, watch this jump!
[189:09.75]Whoa!
[189:11.52]That's actually kind of funny.
[189:12.34]Because I didn't even know this ledge existed.
[189:14.94]I didn't even know the ledge was there.
[189:16.26]So, kind of funny.
[189:17.94]There we go.
[189:18.34]Exploding fucking kiwi berries.
[189:19.94]This is a player.
[189:28.00]This is a player right here.
[189:31.62]Wait, is this like an actual... What the fuck is going on?
[189:39.19]Get out of my game.
[189:41.49]This is my game.
[189:46.52]It's my game.
[189:48.48]You cannot come in my game.
[189:49.62]There's a rat there.
[189:57.65]I gotta get that rat.
[190:09.32]Uh, eat the rat.
[190:10.24]Banana Jokester.
[190:21.49]Yeah, dark spirit taken care of.
[190:22.91]Alright, what else?
[190:24.97]I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[190:32.65]Can I, like, execute this guy?
[190:33.99]Uh... Replace this iron with this one.
[190:42.15]Alright, well, all righty.
[190:46.73]Do it again, come on.
[190:51.18]Shoot.
[190:52.68]Oh, that was an instant kill dropkick.
[190:55.00]I will take that one.
[191:05.29]You guys want a joke?
[191:05.89]How about this one?
[191:06.49]Cobcast sucks!
[191:14.86]This is a statement.
[191:18.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[191:19.78]Actually, I want to dropkick this guy, too, if I get a chance.
[191:22.82]Nah, let's just fight him.
[191:29.00]Finally.
[191:29.88]Oh, well, he just did it anyways.
[191:51.36]Just the truth.
[191:52.22]Not even a joke.
[191:52.78]That's just the truth of the matter.
[191:58.72]This is a depressing old lady gossip stream.
[192:04.50]Oh, yeah.
[192:04.92]I remember when I was 14 years old and I played this game.
[192:10.76]It was amazing.
[192:12.70]They don't make it like they used to.
[192:16.83]They just don't make them like they used to anymore.
[192:18.90]I don't like these damage numbers, they're too big.
[192:22.56]I need some equipment.
[192:29.06]Is anybody gonna fold Jupiter?
[192:35.24]Fold Jupiter.
[192:36.16]Can I see some fucking PogChamps for that fold Jupiter?
[192:46.52]Come on.
[192:47.76]Let your guard down.
[192:53.96]Stupid.
[192:59.98]Here's a good joke.
[193:00.64]Subs are not affected by slow mode.
[193:02.86]I don't think they are.
[193:03.54]It's disabled in my setting.
[193:06.26]Are they?
[193:07.22]They shouldn't be.
[193:08.84]They should not be affected by slow mode.
[193:10.38]If they are, then that is a mistake by some of the moderators.
[193:15.14]I have it like a base setting in my Twitch partnership.
[193:20.68]Come on down.
[193:25.68]Sorry, let me get a big kill on this guy.
[193:29.78]This one's swatted like a fly.
[193:32.70]That works for me.
[193:41.28]Link fan of the year, thanks for the baby sub!
[193:43.54]Nine months, dude.
[193:44.32]Welcome back.
[193:47.09]And it's me, HJB.
[193:50.74]Thank you for the subscription.
[193:51.64]Welcome, dude.
[193:52.00]Hope you're having a good day.
[193:55.96]I know I am.
[193:56.62]Restores HP.
[193:57.72]I will eat that right now.
[194:02.86]Where are we?
[194:10.13]Somebody banned the banners?
[194:12.37]What is going on?
[194:13.09]Uh-oh, lots of people.
[194:15.35]Lots of people.
[194:18.26]I can't switch to it fast enough right now.
[194:25.35]Alright, I'll tell you right now, one of the most awkward things I've ever played in a video game, without a doubt, is using the touchpad and left on the touch, like, the touchpad is a mess right here.
[194:36.60]No way.
[194:38.16]It's a joke.
[194:49.27]You have to use the touchpad with your thumb to scroll and then left on the touchpad or right on the touchpad to do either one of... No, no, no.
[194:56.86]No.
[194:57.26]No, no way.
[194:58.52]Don't think so.
[194:59.52]That ain't gonna happen.
[195:00.24]Especially in like a high stressful situation.
[195:03.93]No way.
[195:06.61]It's a mess.
[195:14.73]Uh, no?
[195:15.09]No boxes?
[195:18.33]PS4 touchpad was a mistake.
[195:21.62]It kind of was.
[195:24.24]Please clap.
[195:25.06]Oh, he has to do a Jeb Bush thing.
[195:28.48]Please clap.
[195:35.75]Oh, boy, that's very... Oh, come on, please.
[195:40.12]I wanted to see what this, like, does.
[195:42.90]Like, how much damage this does.
[195:47.30]Okay.
[195:54.58]Dead.
[195:56.36]You are dead.
[195:57.60]Not big surprise.
[195:59.46]What game is that from?
[196:01.44]If somebody can say what game that's from, I'll, uh... I'll chug the rest of my coffee.
[196:05.45]Go!
[196:08.05]Alright, I'll do it again just in case you guys missed it the first time.
[196:10.31]Oh, you are dead.
[196:11.63]Don't speak surprise.
[196:13.21]What is it?
[196:13.47]What is that?
[196:17.75]Nothing even up there.
[196:22.63]Pac-Man.
[196:24.43]Fuck's sake.
[196:28.85]No one's even saying it.
[196:30.41]Team Fortress 2, there you go.
[196:34.81]Ah.
[196:36.59]Ah.
[196:37.84]We're just sprinting the rest of the way.
[196:39.71]I'm not gonna stop sprinting.
[196:41.75]You wanted a fucking joke stream?
[196:42.99]Well, here you go.
[196:44.19]Here's your joke stream.
[196:46.05]You fucking jokers.
[196:52.12]Here's your fucking joke stream.
[197:10.64]Okay, I'm getting sick of getting fucking irons.
[197:14.22]Is anybody else sick of me getting the same iron over and over again?
[197:16.84]Defense up.
[197:20.90]Ah, I'm out of stuff.
[197:22.06]I need to start actually using these.
[197:27.26]Mr. Big Joke Man.
[197:29.40]Watch Jerma miss this.
[197:30.40]No, he didn't.
[197:31.72]No, he didn't.
[197:34.06]I'm playing a focus game.
[197:35.45]I have to focus.
[197:36.17]Please, hold on.
[197:38.97]Please hold.
[197:40.46]Please hold.
[197:41.72]Please hold.
[197:43.90]Funny jokes.
[197:45.10]Alright, I gotta stop fucking around.
[197:47.42]I don't wanna die down here.
[197:51.47]By the way, iron's a piece of shit too.
[197:57.09]Iron sucks.
[197:58.37]I have no fucking...
[198:17.11]Hey.
[198:17.41]Inuyasha321123, thanks for two months.
[198:20.21]Hey, I return.
[198:21.07]You do return.
[198:25.72]It's me, HJB.
[198:26.44]I already said hello, but welcome again.
[198:27.80]Thanks for the sub.
[198:28.40]Link, fan of the year with the nine months.
[198:30.82]Thank you, guys.
[198:31.70]Welcome back to the channel.
[198:32.98]And... With 1,500 bits, watch me miss this.
[198:37.47]Uh-uh.
[198:37.63]Uh-uh.
[198:38.99]I see the other one.
[198:40.83]I see the other one, Mr. Chan.
[198:42.59]Chan1, I see it.
[198:45.42]But, like, let's be completely honest here.
[198:46.81]No, like, more fucking around.
[198:48.77]Uh, thank you for giving me, like, $31.
[198:50.55]Like, that's very generous of you.
[198:53.13]And everybody else giving the bits, too.
[198:55.71]And people are asking why I don't read the 100 bits.
[198:57.87]I read... It can get hard to keep up with.
[199:03.09]So, I guess, like, you could say anything more than, like, 200 will get, like, read.
[199:07.35]I guess I don't want to do that.
[199:08.41]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[199:11.96]$30 more dollars.
[199:17.42]Like, I love you for giving me any bits at all.
[199:22.81]But it's hard to keep up with reading every bit donation when there's, like, as much of them as there are per stream, pretty much.
[199:32.61]No, no, no.
[199:33.57]I didn't even... Why did I even say that?
[199:36.10]This dude just gave me, like, $70.
[199:38.08]100 bits don't matter.
[199:41.54]Of course they do.
[199:43.69]They absolutely do.
[199:45.07]If anybody gives me even, like, 10 cents, it matters.
[199:48.91]And those of you that don't give any money, it doesn't matter.
[199:50.85]Like, you all matter.
[199:53.05]Jerma won't read this.
[199:53.77]Jerma will never know our love for him.
[199:55.31]Of course I will!
[199:56.59]And I do read them sometimes, but it's hard to keep up with, like, every single bit.
[200:00.82]Because, guys, I'm a fucking idiot.
[200:03.56]You know what I'm... Like, listen.
[200:05.38]I'm fucking stupid.
[200:07.32]You... Me looking over to my other screen, I will get, like, killed by the swamp monster.
[200:13.75]It's hard for me to do, like, three things at the same time.
[200:16.31]But I love each and every fucking one of you guys.
[200:19.78]Missed me?
[200:20.24]I didn't miss you.
[200:20.74]I see you right now.
[200:21.94]Nine cents don't matter?
[200:23.12]No.
[200:24.40]No, now you're putting words in my mouth.
[200:26.60]Spam the ham?
[200:27.46]Heard you like bits.
[200:28.32]Oh, God.
[200:28.78]This is not what I wanted to start right now.
[200:30.71]This is not what I wanted to start.
[200:32.71]I can't afford bits, commanders.
[200:34.03]Don't worry.
[200:34.67]It doesn't, like... You don't have to give any money to this stream.
[200:39.83]Did I make it to this without getting to the elevator here?
[200:42.91]I did.
[200:45.33]I guess I'm just going to skip the elevator here, which is kind of dangerous, but, you know.
[200:48.55]Oh, boy.
[200:48.89]No, that's not a good idea.
[200:52.11]I think I'm going to go back.
[200:54.31]Oh, there is no elevator here.
[200:55.26]What?
[200:56.34]Whatever.
[200:58.76]Sellout streamer.
[200:59.74]Oh, boy.
[201:02.28]I didn't miss you.
[201:03.84]No, I didn't.
[201:08.06]These are from ads.
[201:08.81]Home run nerd.
[201:09.83]God, thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[201:12.83]Stupid seller.
[201:13.67]Streamer hates fans.
[201:17.63]Moo means moo.
[201:18.35]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[201:20.59]Jeremy, you missed my message the first time, but would you ever consider playing Deadly Premonition?
[201:24.16]I think you'd have a blast playing it on stream.
[201:25.92]Also, love you.
[201:27.08]I love you too, Moo.
[201:30.62]But Deadly Premonition, I don't even really know what it is.
[201:36.51]Deadly Premonition.
[201:39.23]Is that kind of like, um... What was that game called?
[201:42.74]Fahrenheit?
[201:47.46]This is a really bad idea.
[201:48.40]I need to, like, go back.
[201:49.20]Oh, great.
[201:51.14]Another invader.
[201:52.92]Another fucking invader.
[201:54.46]Can't wait.
[201:56.44]Shit!
[201:58.18]It's alright.
[201:59.36]I'm okay.
[202:02.67]Oh, you are smart!
[202:03.99]No!
[202:09.10]Oh, you think you're so smart, huh?
[202:10.52]Did you buy a bunch of fucking in-game currency?
[202:12.96]Mmm.
[202:16.92]He's back.
[202:19.10]He's back and he's ready to fucking go again.
[202:22.04]I don't care how much in-game currency it takes.
[202:24.04]I'm fucking gonna go kill you.
[202:28.36]Oh, you think you're a smart one.
[202:30.54]Oh, fuck.
[202:35.33]Shit.
[202:35.59]Yeah, yeah, kill that guy.
[202:37.43]He's got 250 fucking damages to win.
[202:40.43]He's doing a suplex.
[202:43.82]Should have been paying more attention.
[202:46.66]Shouldn't have fucking suplexed that guy.
[202:54.72]Shouldn't have fucking suplexed that guy.
[202:58.48]Pay to fucking win.
[202:59.46]I'm gonna pay to win.
[203:00.12]I'll pay to beat you.
[203:00.94]Pay to win.
[203:02.48]Where's my taunt?
[203:03.54]Where's my taunt?
[203:05.32]Oh shit, I just ate a fucking, what did I eat?
[203:07.44]Okay, that's good.
[203:07.96]Good thing it wasn't a poison mushroom.
[203:13.11]Oh, scorpion.
[203:18.07]Fuck you, stupid bug.
[203:20.83]Alright, honest to god.
[203:23.11]Die.
[203:31.01]Oh, that's a huge amount of attack.
[203:34.57]But yeah, deadly premonition if it's... Must give enough to be loved by the streamer.
[203:39.80]No, custody.
[203:40.48]That's not what I meant.
[203:43.84]What I meant was it can be hard to keep up with all the 100.
[203:47.32]You can't break these boxes.
[203:55.83]Especially when I'm as dumb as I am.
[204:00.45]The best way to kill the score for you step on it with your bare feet It's pretty long I would definitely try it out for sure
[204:29.38]When did this game come out?
[204:30.42]Uh, like, maybe a week ago?
[204:32.18]Two weeks ago?
[204:32.54]Not that long, though.
[204:39.49]Really?
[204:40.65]Of course.
[204:41.01]What a waste of EX meter.
[204:52.89]This weapon does 16 damage.
[204:54.27]It's not even worth using.
[204:56.36]This is a sell-a-damn thing.
[205:10.48]That was pretty cool.
[205:12.34]What mic do I use?
[205:13.34]I use a Neumann.
[205:16.29]I believe it's a Neumann T002 or something.
[205:18.75]Let me see.
[205:20.63]It is.
[205:21.03]I think it's a something 002.
[205:24.30]It's a very, very good mic.
[205:26.76]Remember, this game is really boring to watch.
[205:32.90]I'm just trying it out, man.
[205:36.12]Remember, this stream is not about, like, games you're going to see every day or games you're going to see consistently.
[205:41.83]Just whatever I kind of feel like doing is what I'm going to be streaming, so I just kind of feel like doing this right now.
[205:48.65]There's a guy that's going to be behind me.
[205:51.91]There's a guy going to be behind me, I guarantee it to you.
[205:58.03]I'm going to stun that guy in the corner.
[205:59.41]Shit, I'm going to eat something here.
[206:05.11]I want to pick up some of this stuff.
[206:06.41]When you only donate 99 bits.
[206:08.20]There's this one.
[206:14.78]Deadly poison.
[206:15.58]I'll get that in a minute.
[206:17.44]Let me see what I have in my bag.
[206:21.76]Put this on.
[206:24.66]Trash that.
[206:25.90]Trash this, too.
[206:26.86]I'm not even using it.
[206:28.06]I'm not even using half of this stuff.
[206:29.44]Let's get rid of all this.
[206:33.66]Put this on.
[206:36.98]Trash all the irons.
[206:37.96]I have too many of them.
[206:39.26]I'm not even using them.
[206:43.31]Dermot, your cube?
[206:43.99]Well, thank you.
[206:47.45]I appreciate the compliment.
[206:54.93]Did someone call for a lifetime ban?
[207:07.89]Yeah, I'm not using that weapon again.
[207:09.92]Stagger the time to take to punch again.
[207:12.40]This is probably too long.
[207:14.58]Even if you do the other combo with it.
[207:17.56]I don't like it.
[207:19.62]I don't like it at all.
[207:23.72]Take my only Jerma Buck.
[207:24.88]See?
[207:25.24]See, I'm raiding.
[207:26.72]Guys, I love you all.
[207:34.04]He's all tacked up right now.
[207:35.18]What do you say, fellas?
[207:38.70]A little bit different of an area.
[207:44.12]This is poison.
[207:46.35]Poison emitters.
[207:50.71]Punched right in the face.
[207:56.73]Watch out for the poison.
[208:02.35]Don't stand in it.
[208:03.25]I thought my cell phone was just ringing right there.
[208:09.51]Come on, where's the elevator?
[208:10.34]Is there a mushroom right here?
[208:15.56]Can I actually pick these up?
[208:22.73]Is it like a snail?
[208:24.57]They look like poison snails.
[208:29.13]I'm not sure I can fuck around with these right now.
[208:31.01]I don't want to get poisoned.
[208:32.05]I don't have any health potions.
[208:34.39]So, I'm not going to do that.
[208:40.69]Hello.
[208:43.34]Nice to meet you.
[208:47.90]750 bits, you keep giving money.
[208:51.40]Lala, you keep giving money.
[208:54.60]Hold on, I gotta focus.
[209:00.43]I'm just wearing like a baseball hat.
[209:04.53]Naked guy with a ball cap.
[209:07.55]What?
[209:09.76]Who the fuck is this?
[209:15.60]No, I don't have an elevator here.
[209:19.08]What the?
[209:19.64]What is it?
[209:20.18]What is it?
[209:20.74]What is it?
[209:22.14]What is it?
[209:23.20]What is it?
[209:23.59]I don't have any weapons.
[209:27.21]Oh, shit in my pants.
[209:30.57]Can't wait to use a bunch of in-game currency.
[209:39.03]Looks like laser beams at her face.
[209:40.43]Eat this too.
[209:46.73]That's what I'm doing.
[209:59.72]New strat.
[210:00.81]I'm doing the dropkick strategy, guys.
[210:11.73]Hello!
[210:11.93]Ow!
[210:12.09]Ow!
[210:12.23]Ow!
[210:12.39]No, I can't use one of these.
[210:13.47]Shit.
[210:14.97]I'm in deep trouble here.
[210:52.43]Throw the grenade!
[210:54.77]Throw the grenade!
[210:58.13]Throw the grenade!
[210:58.67]Throw the grenade!
[210:59.13]I'm dead.
[211:03.77]Coming right back to fucking life.
[211:07.65]We spent money, boys and girls.
[211:09.23]Oh, I see.
[211:09.51]You thought you killed me?
[211:11.91]Sorry.
[211:12.13]I spent $13 in this game.
[211:14.32]You're gonna have to kill me 30 more times.
[211:24.87]How many fucking times are you going to shoot this dumb gun?
[211:42.40]You should have shot like 12 times.
[211:58.10]I'm not sure where the opportunity is.
[212:01.64]God.
[212:02.82]This is where a ranged fight would be perfect.
[212:05.92]Lord in heaven.
[212:10.41]Son of a bitch.
[212:24.17]Um...
[212:28.28]I feel like I'm ready to fight this person.
[212:34.34]I don't like going up.
[212:44.72]It's, like, worth me to climb.
[212:52.48]I'm not entirely sure what this is for, though.
[212:54.79]Can I drop on top of her, maybe?
[212:57.88]This is only level 1, you fucking... Well, I take like two hits and die from her.
[213:02.10]What is all this shit over here?
[213:12.25]Uh, well, it's an attack up mushroom.
[213:13.91]Not sure how that helps me.
[213:17.49]Come on, give me something.
[213:28.69]Wish I had range.
[213:37.67]Oh, she's in the poison.
[213:38.53]It's doing two damage to her.
[213:39.87]If they slowly but surely, I can just keep poisoning her, right?
[213:50.03]She does sound like the judge.
[213:52.99]It's actually doing pretty good work.
[213:54.97]It's doing as much as one swing of their baseball bat probably would.
[214:02.64]Is she just poisoned forever?
[214:06.16]Oh, of course not.
[214:13.67]Two damage.
[214:14.31]I don't know how to close the gap to her, though.
[214:21.35]I don't have... I have an iron.
[214:23.67]I do have an iron.
[214:26.11]Good luck.
[214:27.97]What is the EX for the iron?
[214:29.19]I'm sure we're going to find out and die.
[214:36.16]Wait till the poison's done.
[214:37.03]You guys ready?
[214:45.73]Here we go.
[214:46.01]It's gonna be intense.
[214:48.29]I'm gonna go for a jumping dive swing.
[214:54.46]Did you spend some money?
[215:01.54]Spend some more.
[215:07.32]I thought I was gonna be able to do it like a Dark Souls giant, like, slam jump.
[215:16.29]No, don't do that again.
[215:17.21]Don't do that again.
[215:17.79]Get down there.
[215:18.31]I'm spraying you.
[215:25.53]What?
[215:25.79]How would you even see that?
[215:42.08]Slow down, lady.
[215:50.52]Well, there's another poison.
[215:53.80]See?
[215:54.24]She just shoved that over my face.
[216:02.03]Teleport again.
[216:06.40]Oh, she's gonna die eventually.
[216:16.61]Dropkick!
[216:27.67]How did that miss?
[216:29.30]No way!
[216:35.81]What the fuck are you dumb?
[216:37.19]Why is dumb missing?
[216:51.52]I swear to god if I miss another fucking dropkick on this dumb bitch.
[217:03.89]Even when you're locked on, it's just like a straightaway.
[217:05.93]Jesus, man.
[217:17.30]Fuck you!
[217:21.82]Fuck you!
[217:30.84]Die!
[217:31.58]Just punch the shit out of her now.
[217:51.99]Just die.
[217:53.81]I'm not going to use the EX.
[217:58.89]It's kind of hard to do that.
[217:59.75]It's like a big wind-up.
[218:00.73]Where'd she go?
[218:01.77]Is she up top?
[218:05.21]I think she's actually up top.
[218:11.31]She's just up there now.
[218:12.18]We're going for a huge punch.
[218:17.94]Is she all the way up?
[218:20.20]Oh, this is not cool.
[218:21.86]Dude, imagine if I had a gun and I was like a dexterity person.
[218:24.36]I feel like this would be a lot easier.
[218:29.19]Holy fuck you!
[218:29.91]Punch her!
[218:41.43]Got her So close to my first try

[227:00.69]No, it was.
[227:01.32]It was.
[227:02.66]Greed's taking over his mind.
[227:03.62]Instead of seeing people, he just sees bits.
[227:04.96]You guys, come on.
[227:10.86]Don't do this to me.
[227:11.70]Okay, there's no point in going over there.
[227:17.57]Can I get out?
[227:20.95]Of course there is.
[227:21.45]There's a gas can up here.
[227:29.98]Good thing this game sucks.
[227:31.44]Look at that.
[227:33.68]I made it.
[227:34.05]I bet you won't read this because I didn't give you cash, ColdestFridge.
[227:41.91]I just read it out loud.
[227:48.83]That's $200,000.
[227:50.39]See, now people are going to just do it.
[227:52.35]And he's going to give money and money and money and money.
[227:54.69]I don't want to be a money guy.
[227:57.25]I want to be a regular guy.
[228:00.11]There's a ladder right here.
[228:04.26]Can't climb the ladder.
[228:10.06]Game doesn't suck.
[228:13.26]I mean, it's getting pretty bad reviews.
[228:17.15]It's got like fives and sixes across the board.
[228:19.71]But it's fun enough.
[228:32.98]Regular guy, wheelbarrow, scraper.
[228:36.24]What is another bit in the wall?
[228:37.52]Moo means moo.
[228:38.24]Suicide of Spree 200.
[228:40.36]Simple farmer, thanks for the bits.
[228:41.82]French bits have always been celebrated.
[228:44.22]Why did you quit?
[228:44.80]Wow.
[228:46.76]Um... I don't know.
[228:49.28]I didn't... It just wasn't doing it for me anymore.
[228:51.38]I think it's when 7.1 came out.
[228:55.04]And it got to a point where it was just too much for me to do.
[228:59.75]I added a bunch of content, and I felt like I was kind of just doing the same thing over and over again.
[229:02.97]Now you hit that wall.
[229:05.15]You hit the MMO wall.
[229:09.39]And I've been playing it since Legion's launch.
[229:11.40]Legion was awesome, don't get me wrong.
[229:15.16]Legion was like the best thing that happened to WoW.
[229:16.58]Is he shooting at me?
[229:21.68]Legion was definitely the best thing that happened to WoW.
[229:24.72]In like 10 years, almost.
[229:28.09]Suck this down!
[229:31.26]Oh, this is a person.
[229:33.28]This is Brain Man.
[229:36.10]Oh, you just got destroyed.
[229:40.24]Invader.
[229:40.66]I'm going to pretend those are invaders because they make me feel like I'm better into doing PvP stuff.
[229:45.71]When does the gorilla close the book?
[229:53.61]Soon.
[230:04.56]Not down here.
[230:05.20]That move was dumb.
[230:21.72]That move was cool.
[230:22.78]The other one was dumb.
[230:27.32]Why am I not wearing pants?
[230:29.94]Because... It's a lifestyle choice, okay?
[230:47.47]It's just a lifestyle choice, guys.
[230:49.87]Fuck.
[230:50.13]Out of space.
[230:50.97]Let's get rid of this.
[231:04.49]Another snail.
[231:05.45]Oh, lots of healing snails here.
[231:12.27]Um... Shit.
[231:15.35]I'm just gonna get rid of this stupid iron.
[231:19.45]Can't even afford to carry that one, so we're gonna skip it.
[231:24.79]There's another way up, and I can't even go this way.
[231:29.93]Shit!
[231:31.87]Well, back over here, then.
[231:38.35]All mods get an image of me without pants on.
[231:40.22]That'd be kind of fun.
[231:43.04]What?
[231:45.42]No, it wouldn't.
[231:45.86]That'd be kind of fun.
[231:47.42]Alright, if I'm just filling air.
[231:50.56]That'd be kind of fun.
[231:56.63]Oh, you fucking stupid shithead.
[232:00.63]Turn this off.
[232:03.12]Disable it.
[232:04.06]Disable the machine.
[232:04.78]I broke my weapon.
[232:09.20]Glad that was not worth doing at all.
[232:11.41]I'm so happy that was worth it.
[232:14.01]And now I don't have a weapon.
[232:16.13]Well, of course I do.
[232:16.61]There's always an iron.
[232:19.25]Remember, guys.
[232:21.15]There's always an iron.
[232:23.77]No matter what.
[232:26.03]Just eat the rat.
[232:46.34]Ah, whatever.
[232:47.36]Animation takes too long.
[232:50.09]Can't hide what's inside.
[232:53.37]I can't even afford to pick this one up either.
[232:54.75]I guess I can.
[232:58.95]Oh, well, we can go up.
[233:05.05]Can we?
[233:07.85]Ah.
[233:12.68]No, we can't.
[233:20.20]Alright, we found another way to get away, I guess.
[233:24.02]Oh, hello.
[233:29.51]What the hell?
[233:30.89]Hey, hey.
[233:36.57]Zero.
[233:37.33]Zero.
[233:38.37]Zero.
[233:40.19]Zero.
[233:43.04]Oh, this is not good.
[233:48.26]I hate these enclosed areas.
[233:49.42]It's going to be hard to fight you.
[233:50.72]Eat a snail.
[233:53.90]Come on.
[233:57.62]No.
[233:58.69]Son of a bitch.
[234:04.01]I'm barely even hurting this thing.
[234:06.37]That guy was kind of picky.
[234:14.61]50 cent pay to win.
[234:15.41]Incoming.
[234:17.23]Not quite.
[234:17.97]Almost, though.
[234:20.41]Oh, metal socks.
[234:21.51]2240.
[234:21.81]Gave 500 bits.
[234:22.47]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[234:24.22]I'm lost in the electronic section of Walmart again.
[234:29.06]Oh, here's an idea.
[234:29.64]I'll give you a tip.
[234:30.84]Just, like, scream mom.
[234:33.04]Somebody will eventually listen.
[234:35.94]Just go, mom!
[234:37.60]And somebody that's a mom will be like, where's my son?
[234:40.50]Even if they're done with their kid with them.
[234:44.24]It works every time.
[234:47.86]I just held in like four burps.
[234:49.45]Pretty good.
[235:02.90]Come on this way.
[235:03.52]I think I'm going to eat this shit and fight.
[235:17.08]He can just take a lot of hits.
[235:19.02]Break his back!
[235:23.50]I'm gonna need to do one more of those and I get my quest.
[235:34.65]Jerma Suplex!
[235:40.81]Any more people?
[235:43.37]Buzzsaw.
[235:45.40]I hope the items get a little more interesting.
[235:50.34]This is probably the 28th buzzsaw.
[235:57.15]So far.
[236:00.93]Never trust purple thanks to the bits.
[236:02.09]I was in Best Buy last.
[236:04.21]I set all the laptops to play the Jerma rumble stream.
[236:07.31]I came back in 10 minutes and they'd all been shut off by staff.
[236:14.55]Uh, here's a funny story for you.
[236:16.71]It's not really a funny story.
[236:17.53]It's just, I mean, it's a story.
[236:20.51]You know the Apple Store?
[236:22.31]How the Apple Store has the line of iPads?
[236:26.84]Or the line of iMacs?
[236:28.80]And you can, like, play with them and check out the apps and take photos.
[236:32.40]Me and Burgah Boy used to go in.
[236:34.00]And there's still no elevator.
[236:45.13]I don't think I missed anything down here.
[236:48.88]I definitely didn't.
[236:52.52]Well, I'm going up again.
[236:54.52]Anyways, OK, so me and Burgah Boy used to go into the Apple store and one by one, line by line, he would take a horrendous picture of his face with every single iPad.
[237:14.63]every single one would do he would do like the scrunched up face and it would just be a line of like 20 ipads that all had essentially the same image on them it's pretty funny because I can imagine like walking out let's check out the ipads oh there's like a guy's face okay guy another close-up like awful image of a guy's face ah those are the jackals they are body collectors
[237:42.48]I wouldn't get in their way if I were you.
[237:46.28]I know, I know.
[237:47.20]They got cool looking equipment.
[237:49.00]Good luck trying to get it off them.
[237:50.96]Huh?
[238:01.11]What are these things?
[238:02.41]Is that me?
[238:02.97]That's me!
[238:04.63]What?
[238:10.07]What is this music?
[238:15.22]Oh yeah, can't wait to fight you with my shitty drill.
[238:19.02]And the sword I don't even have.
[238:30.47]What the fuck?
[238:35.41]I didn't even get a chance.
[238:39.22]I didn't even get a chance.
[238:43.58]Who the fuck is that guy?
[238:49.58]Oh, that wasn't even me.
[238:50.52]That wasn't me.
[238:54.98]I thought that was me.
[238:57.21]That's fucking hilarious.
[239:03.19]Oh, goodness.
[239:03.89]DH service.
[239:06.79]No, fuck you, DH service.
[239:10.73]I need to go back home.
[239:15.10]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[239:15.60]I don't have pants.
[239:17.63]Tack up.
[239:18.15]I can't carry more of these.
[239:21.61]All I know is to stay away from the jackals.
[239:23.73]They'll shoot you in the head instantly.
[239:25.19]They weren't even wearing my shitty rain poncho.
[239:30.30]Yeah, but they had, like, the same face.
[239:31.70]I thought it was just, like, the default in-game, like, that's who you are.
[239:40.34]That's a lot.
[239:40.92]Okay, I need to... I need to pick that up.
[239:45.56]Get rid of one of the fucking dumb snails.
[239:47.04]Because that is a huge amount of attack power.
[239:52.26]I'm not going to turn the corner and run right into that group, aren't I?
[239:59.03]That hit me.
[239:59.73]That hit my coat.
[240:01.01]I'm taking the coat off.
[240:11.50]Special weapon.
[240:12.90]Okay.
[240:25.00]Alright, well I wanted to sneak up on him, but it didn't really work out as intended.
[240:42.66]Do I have a new attack with this yet?
[240:44.83]No, that's not the right fucking time.
[240:54.92]Why aren't you just standing still for me?
[240:58.54]Like, the game just... They didn't even know what to do there.
[241:00.62]That's cool.
[241:02.11]Eat a snail.
[241:03.63]Equipment really starts to change up every 10 floors, and so does environment.
[241:08.95]Okay, that's cool to know.
[241:17.07]Oh, right here.
[241:19.63]Fiber hemp, okay.
[241:21.78]I need an elevator...
[241:29.59]Got him.
[241:32.11]Frog.
[241:36.01]Leather.
[241:39.05]So much just random junk that I need to store, but I haven't had an elevator in like three or four floors.
[241:46.02]I'm going to take no wood.
[241:47.40]I feel like that's a different thing to exchange for.
[241:50.08]And all these frogs and shit.
[241:52.70]I can't.
[241:53.74]No.
[241:54.76]Just leave them.
[241:55.70]They'll be here later, I think.
[241:58.47]More leather.
[241:59.03]I feel like I need this shit.
[242:01.27]Gas can.
[242:05.27]Raincoat.
[242:11.84]I have four healing potions at this point.
[242:22.77]Get up!
[242:24.57]Get out of the way!
[242:38.55]Everything's broken.
[242:40.49]Fantastic.
[242:48.80]Shit, another?
[242:53.34]Another?
[242:54.84]Another?
[242:55.38]Ah!
[242:56.06]Huh?
[242:58.16]That actually skips.
[243:02.40]Fuck it.
[243:02.76]Oh yeah, kill him.
[243:03.98]Kill him.
[243:04.55]Be an idiot.
[243:07.74]Who the fuck are these people?
[243:09.18]Who are these people?
[243:12.82]What is happening?
[243:15.16]Okay, this is fucking... This is some shit right here.
[243:24.45]It's just a brawl.
[243:27.03]It's just a brawl.
[243:29.05]This is so dumb.
[243:34.79]Just get me under the... No, the gate's not open yet.
[243:37.91]Go!
[243:39.17]Go!
[243:39.83]Go!
[243:46.79]See ya.
[243:48.31]Floor number nine.
[243:53.59]Is somebody, like, invading me?
[243:54.85]Is that what that means?
[243:59.80]Does that mean, like, a guy's coming in here with, like, his five enemies or something and trying to kill me?
[244:11.73]I'm still naked.
[244:16.79]Is there a elevator on this floor?
[244:22.76]We're so high up at this point.
[244:25.46]They punched my clothes off.
[244:26.66]They really did.
[244:27.24]I don't have anything.
[244:34.66]Yes.
[244:35.84]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[244:37.22]Activate this shit.
[244:42.67]Hell yeah.
[244:45.15]Let's get back down.
[244:46.01]It's a long way.
[244:48.28]Thousand gold for the waiting room.
[244:51.92]A red name is a hunter a player sent him to kill you.
[244:55.72]Well... Come on, people are like sending me shit?
[244:58.56]You trying to like kill me?
[245:05.43]Thank you, Obey the Kitten for two months.
[245:07.81]Froboy11 thanks for the sub.
[245:09.49]Warvoid for seven months.
[245:15.25]Thank you.
[245:17.17]Thank you OwlDog for the bits.
[245:18.35]RadioVidya for the bits.
[245:20.39]NeverTrustedPurple for the bits.
[245:22.04]Thank you for the bits.
[245:23.60]Thank you guys for giving all those bits.
[245:26.12]There's an elevator icon on the floor.
[245:28.84]I should probably pay attention to that.
[245:29.88]Instead of being a fucking dumbass.
[245:38.95]Just beat Heroics and Arius.
[245:40.87]Nice, dude.
[245:42.05]Hell yeah.
[245:44.75]Full Jupiter.
[245:45.55]I can't believe people can actually still get those.
[245:56.79]15 and 15,000.
[245:57.31]Have I made it to the point where I can continue leveling up or not?
[246:08.54]Should I...
[246:11.89]Alright, for those of you guys that have, is there any reason for me not to max out everything until, or should I hold on to these and just not put any in dexterity for any reason?
[246:21.67]Like once I get up to like a floor 10, right, I can put more points in.
[246:24.71]Does it cost more experience?
[246:26.66]Did I just leave this at one?
[246:31.02]I feel like I shouldn't fuck with this right now.
[246:40.91]My place is... My place is destroyed.
[246:45.39]How do I fix my place?
[246:51.71]You have to place your own fighters in order to defend the waiting room.
[246:59.78]Do I have to like... Can I repair my ship?
[247:08.75]Defense?
[247:10.80]Defense failure?
[247:13.87]What?
[247:15.93]Oh, so this is the guy that came in here and, like, stole money from me?
[247:20.29]Okay.
[247:30.06]Defense settings?
[247:31.34]What did I just do?
[247:33.80]Oh, I gotta, like, hire?
[247:34.82]Purchase a new fighter?
[247:40.70]Okay, Bradley.
[247:42.50]Come on in, Bradley.
[247:46.66]Okay, Bradley, you gotta hold the fort down.
[247:51.40]What the fuck this means?
[248:00.08]How do I repair my facility?
[248:05.90]Everything's just destroyed.
[248:08.48]Let me give him the blueprints first.
[248:12.98]Yeah, one level one naked man.
[248:14.46]Okay, we have that level two.
[248:16.96]Cotton, cotton, cotton, cotton.
[248:18.46]I've not seen one cotton.
[248:29.29]Oh, in-game currency.
[248:30.37]Five minutes to complete it?
[248:31.31]We got plenty.
[248:31.79]No.
[248:32.77]That's a waste.
[248:33.86]Actually, is it?
[248:35.20]It gives a shit.
[248:37.95]That's like 50 cents.
[248:38.99]Do it again.
[248:43.13]Oh yeah, here we go, another one.
[248:49.68]Seven minutes?
[248:52.14]You mean immediately is what he meant.
[248:53.40]Yeah.
[249:09.06]Okay, not doing that anymore.
[249:11.00]Give me one of these.
[249:11.58]A thousand gold!
[249:20.31]He's wasting them.
[249:21.49]It's not a big deal.
[249:24.65]I did that as like a joke.
[249:28.61]I'm gonna have a great hat.
[249:41.04]Store this stuff.
[249:45.16]Fuel is addiction.
[249:46.54]Come back anytime.
[249:48.79]I think I really made somebody mad by doing that, by the way.
[249:54.27]Somebody was furious about that.
[249:55.87]Pay to laugh.
[250:10.29]Alright, what do I have?
[250:11.59]No cotton or anything, right?
[250:14.83]Okay.
[250:28.26]I wish I could make a weapon.
[250:30.90]Can't really do anything, though.
[250:34.60]Cook the snails, at least.
[250:45.76]Oh, no, that's a cooked one.
[250:48.78]Now I have to cook this one, too, please.
[250:52.16]Thank you.
[250:52.52]Any new decals or anything?
[250:57.66]No.
[250:58.47]Put on the helmet, at least.
[251:00.03]Oh, no, that's not what I wanted.
[251:17.19]Put on the helmet.
[251:28.08]Thank you, tender taco.
[251:29.91]For the two months.
[251:32.01]And obey the kitten for two months, too.
[251:36.31]Alright, let me go to the arcade for a second.
[251:46.10]I feel like this guy doesn't really do much.
[251:48.05]Is this game for really actually telling me that this is how you reload like three hours into the game?
[252:16.01]Any more tips?
[252:19.11]Look at me now, Mom!
[252:21.41]Okay.
[252:25.54]Dude, dude, dude, I'm in the middle of a perfect run.
[252:28.04]Have I completed any of these?
[252:33.60]I don't think so.
[252:33.96]Sorry I was such a biatch earlier, but my, like, a-hole mullah head boyfriend was being such a dipwad the other day.
[252:40.41]He was, like, totally twisting my knobs.
[252:45.20]Oh, boy.
[252:45.50]A lot of stuff here.
[252:48.06]Claim your reward in the reward box.
[252:52.90]Difficulty five.
[252:53.80]Defeat any of the jackals.
[252:55.07]I feel like that's not going to be happening for a while.
[252:59.79]Defeat a hater.
[253:00.53]Defeat bullet tuber, bone tuber.
[253:03.93]Defeat 30 scratch tubers.
[253:09.76]Oh, I could have came back from here.
[253:10.94]Oh, my God.
[253:14.32]Um...
[253:16.61]I mean, let's just take them.
[253:19.73]I can have up to ten, right?
[253:21.03]To be scratch tubers or something.
[253:28.12]Life is Strange.
[253:28.92]Alright, let's go.
[253:31.26]I have new mail, do I?
[253:44.13]More fighters for sale.
[253:45.13]It's me.
[253:45.43]More fighters have been added.
[253:46.17]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[253:48.94]Whatever you say, Uncle Death.
[253:55.56]Just kind of wish I could make a weapon of some sort.
[253:59.82]Where's my reward box?
[254:01.58]No, over here.
[254:08.02]Let's get it.
[254:12.05]The AmeriMan, 1500 bits.
[254:13.87]Thanks for the 15 bucks, dude.
[254:14.83]I can't get a full juke, but I can give my favorite wheelbarrow streamer 1500 bits.
[254:21.36]Well, thanks a lot, dude.
[254:24.60]Much appreciated.
[254:28.30]Glad you're enjoying the stream.
[254:33.62]Full juke.
[254:36.59]You'll get the full juke dream at some point.
[254:39.03]I believe it.
[254:42.93]Alright, let's get to floor 10.
[254:43.93]What do you say, huh?
[254:45.71]So, let me get this straight.
[254:49.07]The leveling up process... Should I skip putting five points of dexterity, or is there no reason not to?
[254:56.51]Helmet on the balcony.
[255:00.98]He already got it.
[255:11.85]Buy a new guy?
[255:12.75]I should purchase a new dude?
[255:18.48]No reason not to.
[255:19.20]Let me go to the fridge.
[255:22.02]I just want to see.
[255:22.90]Hold on.
[255:23.24]Where's the fridge?
[255:28.40]Because it said there was new fighters and shit.
[255:30.04]Let's see.
[255:32.08]Bradley all-rounder.
[255:35.75]This is me.
[255:37.59]Level 21.
[255:38.27]Level 1.
[255:38.57]Does he have the stamina?
[255:41.05]No.
[255:43.37]Skill slots, skill slots.
[255:49.49]The character's cap.
[255:50.51]Yeah, I'll just do it.
[255:51.13]Who cares?
[255:53.03]Gotta make a new Bradley.
[255:56.80]Stamina.
[255:57.50]Does he have more stamina?
[255:59.16]Like, base than this guy does?
[256:04.26]Deployed.
[256:04.90]Oh, whatever.
[256:11.67]That's stuff that I'm going to have to look into like off stream or something because I don't want to sit there and look at menus.
[256:16.47]I'd rather have you guys watch me fight things.
[256:20.95]So let's put the points in.
[256:39.90]But I can actually buy one with a new slot.
[256:41.68]Let me see it.
[256:42.02]I just don't want to be like sitting here for like 10-20 minutes.
[256:48.86]In use.
[256:49.76]Empty.
[256:51.24]Transferring to the fighter depot.
[256:52.66]Alright.
[257:00.60]Grade 1.
[257:03.68]All-rounder.
[257:04.14]Striker.
[257:04.90]Striker.
[257:07.38]Defender, attacker.
[257:08.48]Attacking, specializing in fate.
[257:13.10]HP and dex.
[257:16.06]Skill master.
[257:17.78]Let's go with a striker.
[257:19.20]Close range HP and strength.
[257:20.36]18 slots.
[257:23.30]It only has 18 slots?
[257:26.35]These guys all have 18.
[257:27.13]These guys all suck.
[257:31.31]I'm going to get a striker.
[257:32.03]Let's just try it.
[257:36.17]Yook.
[257:40.46]Don't buy a fighter till after floor 10.
[257:42.00]I mean, there's a thousand.
[257:44.70]Can I just like throw this guy somewhere else?
[257:55.23]So there he is.
[257:55.95]I guess I can... So I can select him and take him through.
[258:04.08]In use.
[258:06.11]Deployed.
[258:08.51]Confirmed.
[258:09.15]So you can just take another guy through?
[258:11.05]Let me see.
[258:17.91]Just curious.
[258:21.59]So I go like hang myself up to dry?
[258:23.47]Alright.
[258:34.58]Let me go take a look.
[258:38.12]So this guy's down to level 1.
[258:46.40]Go to grade 2?
[258:47.01]I don't think I can do that yet.
[258:47.99]Until I beat floor 10, right?
[258:51.91]This guy doesn't have any experience.
[258:56.67]Alright, well I think I understand how this one works now.
[258:59.38]I'm gonna get my other guy.
[259:04.12]Let's get out to floor 10 and see if that changes.
[259:07.63]Oh, where is he?
[259:08.39]Bradley.
[259:09.25]Bradley Dean.
[259:12.31]Hello, Dean.
[259:18.85]Think you're on floor 11?
[259:20.03]I think I was on floor 9.
[259:21.97]Wasn't I?
[259:22.29]I think floor 10 is the one I'm about to be on.
[259:28.57]Oh, shit.
[259:28.93]A double full Jupiter.
[259:31.61]No way.
[259:34.72]Let's go back to fighting things.
[259:35.66]I want to get past floor 10.
[259:42.50]Yeah, see?
[259:42.84]I was in floor 9.
[259:46.20]I have to beat two more floors.
[259:50.32]No need to worry about this guy.
[259:51.20]If he dies, you only lose garbage.
[259:56.32]That's true, but this guy's kind of... I mean, it's a guy I've been playing with.
[259:59.73]I'd rather try to get past 10 with this guy than throw a random level 1 shithead in.
[260:09.13]I think I could probably get 50 or so hours out of this janky-ass game before I got bored.
[260:14.01]Yeah, I mean, I'm still interested.
[260:18.17]I'm still having fun.
[260:21.01]I would stop playing if I wasn't having any fun.
[260:24.17]Alright, this way.
[260:26.69]Hello, you!
[260:27.39]Level 25.
[260:28.82]Yeah.
[260:45.32]A lot of you guys know shit Well, I'm glad that you're doing work for me person Oh shit leave me alone Damn it
[261:15.15]She turned around at the worst time.
[261:16.46]This person's level 30.
[261:21.14]What the hell?
[261:30.08]Really?
[261:34.80]You're gonna block that shit?
[261:36.62]Come on now.
[261:41.57]Why do I have to be naked?
[261:49.77]Shit my character's been naked for like 30 minutes Put your guard down, please Why are you so good at blocking things
[262:27.92]This is a good spot for it.
[262:28.78]Nice.
[262:29.20]Got it.
[262:29.38]Why can't?
[262:57.69]I get your stupid melee weapon that you had.
[263:02.44]We can go up again.
[263:07.04]We can go to floor 10.
[263:07.80]Or should I just explore floor 9 a little bit?
[263:09.22]Let's explore a little bit.
[263:11.86]Oh, whoops.
[263:16.41]I thought that was a heal.
[263:18.03]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[263:19.19]Oh well.
[263:20.67]Sometimes you're an idiot.
[263:21.37]Because I didn't go over here.
[263:29.68]Ah, screw it.
[263:31.92]I wasted a good consumable because I thought it was a snail.
[263:41.90]Snail down, yep.
[263:44.30]That's what happens when you're a naked moron.
[263:47.96]Alright, can we cool it on the Jupiters?
[263:51.26]All I see is Jupiters.
[263:54.60]Alright, floor 10.
[263:58.62]Here we go.
[264:06.17]This dude is an animal.
[264:09.34]Killer Crocomire.
[264:10.50]Thank you for the three months.
[264:12.54]Much love.
[264:12.96]Keep doing... Keep doing your do.
[264:16.04]Mountain Dew sponsored by Mountain Dew.
[264:19.16]Well, Crocomire, you've been around for a while.
[264:21.29]And you've given lots of money over the last few months, so... Thanks a lot, Croc.
[264:26.39]Welcome back for three months.
[264:29.39]Here comes even more Jupiters.
[264:33.85]Well, I made it to floor 10.
[264:35.51]This is floor 10.
[264:37.79]Okay.
[264:39.31]That was easy.
[264:42.06]That was a hard floor.
[264:44.12]Well, okay.
[264:44.74]We'll just keep going.
[264:45.42]I don't need to go down yet.
[264:52.78]Oh, there he is.
[264:53.24]There's the guy.
[264:54.44]Hi, guy.
[264:55.54]I can't believe you made it this far, senpai.
[264:58.57]This is your first big challenge on your way to the top.
[265:07.34]I don't think I'm ready for this, actually.
[265:09.90]I'm naked and I have no weapons.
[265:17.30]Should I do this very obvious boss fight naked with fists only?
[265:22.92]It's not going to happen.
[265:26.14]What was over here?
[265:27.56]Anything?
[265:30.01]Just going down.
[265:33.22]Alright, let's try it.
[265:34.26]Whatever.
[265:34.70]What's the worst that's gonna happen?
[265:36.22]I just lose.
[265:37.30]Don't worry, I got a cool hat.
[265:43.80]Yeah, that's true.
[265:44.36]Did you see my triple Jupiter?
[265:47.54]I saw a lot of the Jupes.
[265:51.38]No balls, coward.
[265:52.35]I just did it.
[265:52.85]I just did it, man.
[265:55.05]Come on.
[265:56.31]You are very not ready.
[265:58.37]This is like the first real boss.
[266:01.17]Alright.
[266:03.41]Looks like I got another new visitor.
[266:07.70]Pretty nice equipment you got there.
[266:10.20]I commend your choice of weaponry.
[266:12.42]But you know where you are, don't ya?
[266:15.26]This is my turf, the first dawn of the Tower of Barbs.
[266:20.10]And guess what I do to visitors?
[266:37.46]I treat them as prey for DOD arms.
[266:43.35]You won't get this stamp from me without a fight.
[266:46.09]I'm on the train?
[266:51.01]What the hell, dude?
[266:52.07]I have no items.
[266:54.95]I command your weaponry.
[266:56.53]You have a fucking stupid bike helmet with a light on it.
[267:00.53]Looks like you have to make your way to the first car of the train for this boss battle.
[267:04.37]Good, maybe I get an item.
[267:05.01]Just try not to fall, because you'll die.
[267:08.63]Maybe I'll actually get an item.
[267:09.67]My god, do you see how much damage you just did to me?
[267:32.29]Welcome back.
[267:33.51]So what do you think about our insurance offer now?
[267:42.21]Let's go!
[267:42.67]Honestly, God.
[267:53.13]I couldn't even do anything because I didn't want to roll off the train.
[267:57.32]That guy did 5 billion damage to me in one second.
[268:01.76]He didn't even know I was going to revive into a suplex!
[268:08.28]Yeah, you didn't pay money, I did.
[268:11.34]Of course you don't drop anything.
[268:17.28]Dammit.
[268:19.90]I'm not gonna fight the boss like this, are you shitting me?
[268:23.19]I'm about to spend all $13 by the way, guys.
[268:26.69]All gonna go away.
[268:27.37]I'm not even hurting these guys.
[268:38.14]It's going to take everything I have to kill one of these people.
[268:42.21]Give me a claw.
[268:43.25]Give me something.
[268:47.16]Stupid.
[268:48.80]Give me a weapon.
[268:50.04]Give me anything.
[268:50.78]I'll take a buzzsaw.
[268:51.56]I'll take an iron at this point.
[268:52.92]Give me an iron.
[268:54.51]I would love an...
[269:09.10]Please give me that hammer, before I fuck you up.
[269:19.30]Hammer.
[269:21.80]There's something on the ground that's wedged over here.
[269:23.64]Yeah, it's the hammer.
[269:24.16]Let me take care of this guy first.
[269:26.66]I can't believe I'm naked right now.
[269:38.39]There's a weapon and... Come on.
[269:40.21]No, nothing.
[269:41.97]Rare metal.
[269:44.05]I still have a weapon.
[269:44.79]I have one snail.
[269:56.88]Scum!
[270:01.68]Scum!
[270:07.28]What is it?
[270:08.39]Okay, an iron.
[270:09.99]I'll take an iron.
[270:13.17]That's not terrible.
[270:14.45]It's pretty terrible, let's be real.
[270:20.31]Scorpion.
[270:22.73]Stomp him.
[270:25.83]And what is it?
[270:27.15]Take that.
[270:28.31]You need all the health you can get.
[270:31.46]Did I hit pay to win?
[270:32.68]Oh my god, Lala.
[270:33.98]30 bucks again from Lala.
[270:38.53]You're a madman!
[270:39.29]You're a madwoman!
[270:41.77]Somebody's shooting.
[270:51.54]That's fairly annoying.
[270:52.34]Can I climb up there somehow?
[270:54.80]I don't know what to do with this.
[270:55.94]I would have to just sprint by it.
[270:57.40]Aaaaah!
[271:00.56]Aaaaah!
[271:06.80]there's a dangerous drop on this train car be careful son there's a buzzsaw in here they're killing all kinds of traps oh shit oh my god oh my god oh my god where's it going oh my god oh my god
[271:34.84]I made it.
[271:35.62]That was terrifying.
[271:36.53]For real.
[271:40.49]What the hell?
[271:48.99]I don't like this boss area.
[271:51.27]Which way do I go here?
[271:52.13]This way or that way?
[272:03.79]Okay, stuff in here.
[272:05.91]I'm stunned.
[272:07.53]Fuck this.
[272:09.33]Holy fuck.
[272:11.77]Oh my god!
[272:16.73]Where am I?
[272:18.95]I'm okay.
[272:20.35]I'm alright, somehow.
[272:22.79]But what?
[272:23.13]I don't even know where the hell I ended up right here.
[272:25.25]Oh, that door?
[272:28.11]Jesus.
[272:40.37]Tony, come on.
[272:41.21]Not a guy that died over here.
[272:44.48]Such a tiny little area to fight this hunter.
[272:57.59]I'm just being electric.
[272:58.43]This is such a horrible place to fight anybody.
[273:00.77]I'm...
[273:09.40]This area sucks.
[273:11.70]I think the game fucking crashed on me.
[273:16.75]What?
[273:23.61]I'm at the very beginning of the level.
[273:24.60]Well, at least the things are dead.
[273:46.19]Well, okay.
[273:52.12]Apparently don't have any weapons anymore.
[273:53.58]That was such a bad place to fight a hunter, too.
[273:56.00]That sucked.
[273:58.38]Climb this.
[274:07.96]Things destroyed.
[274:08.72]I've lost the hammer.
[274:10.46]Oh!
[274:10.52]Yeah, I know.
[274:11.34]What the hell is it?
[274:12.36]Would've been easier if I just died.
[274:14.98]I know.
[274:15.28]No, it comes this way.
[274:32.59]Alright, I got through that.
[274:33.63]This sucks!
[274:36.19]Dude, I think I have to level up like ten more times before I attempt this again.
[274:40.75]Maybe at least I was trying to get to the boss.
[274:51.49]At least.
[274:55.56]Hold on a second.
[274:56.90]I see a box over there with stuff over here, but I'm scared to go get it.
[274:59.46]Just take a look.
[275:01.84]Can I make this jump?
[275:05.10]No way.
[275:05.42]I'm gonna get zapped.
[275:06.84]I'm gonna get zapped.
[275:07.76]I'm gonna get zapped.
[275:08.30]I'm gonna go for it.
[275:11.28]Yep.
[275:11.48]I knew it.
[275:12.08]I knew that was gonna happen, but... Ah, there he is!
[275:20.39]Who is it?
[275:20.85]Who is it?
[275:24.19]Knock him off the train.
[275:28.96]I think shooting fire.
[275:29.98]This is a fun house.
[275:35.94]I don't like the fun house level.
[275:46.61]Maybe he'll just be an idiot and he'll fall off.
[275:54.61]This guy's like four levels higher than me.
[275:59.80]And I have to fight him on this train spot.
[276:03.28]Alright, we're going for cheeseball.
[276:10.58]The shittiest gun I have.
[276:11.72]The shittiest item I have is naked.
[276:14.32]Let me get in that window.
[276:15.34]Ooh, we got a cheeseball here.
[276:24.82]Yes.
[276:26.90]Yes.
[276:28.27]Yes.
[276:31.16]Come on, hit him.
[276:46.24]God.
[276:52.27]Oh, he keeps juking me.
[276:59.21]Now I have to actually kill him, though.
[277:04.73]Okay, those two missed.
[277:06.01]It's alright.
[277:06.77]He's down to like 10% health.
[277:08.91]I just have to smash him in the face.
[277:16.32]Got him!
[277:17.38]Get out of here.
[277:18.98]And give me your hammer.
[277:19.70]Of course, you have to put that in the worst spot for me, game.
[277:26.84]And it still hit me.
[277:35.43]Help?
[277:36.07]No, attack, help.
[277:42.19]An iron?
[277:42.87]I said I would take an iron.
[277:47.73]No, I... Oh, my God.
[277:50.66]I... Please.
[277:52.46]Okay, thank goodness.
[277:54.18]I thought I just deleted someone for some reason.
[277:57.60]Conehead sucks.
[277:58.62]We don't want the conehead.
[277:59.50]Alright.
[278:04.42]Let's continue this trek through the house of horrors.
[278:13.76]This is it, right?
[278:17.58]This has to be it.
[278:18.22]There's no more trains.
[278:24.32]That's the guy.
[278:24.92]I didn't think you'd make it this far.
[278:27.94]What the fuck?
[278:30.56]Did you just laugh at me, you puke?
[278:32.52]You're gonna die.
[278:34.48]He's like a screw.
[278:36.60]This guy's a screw.
[278:39.62]He is the train.
[278:44.74]Yeah.
[279:01.51]I'm not ready for this.
[279:17.50]I'm gonna get him!
[279:18.00]I'm the naked guy with a hammer!
[279:23.92]And there's electricity everywhere too.
[279:29.43]Look at that, I did 24 damage to him.
[279:44.78]Is it even worth eating?
[279:45.70]You guys like how much damage I did to him?
[279:52.87]I did a lot, didn't I?
[280:02.08]There's no chance.
[280:09.08]There's nowhere to go.
[280:12.57]I just... Okay, hold on.
[280:14.49]Give me a second.
[280:18.01]Okay, I'm gonna run out of currency.
[280:21.90]Let's go with my hammer at least.
[280:23.54]I'm gonna play this very conservatively.
[280:25.54]I'm gonna be such a coward.
[280:34.25]That's so little damage.
[280:36.61]I might as well be stroking his back.
[280:48.16]If the electricity wasn't here, this wouldn't be so terrible.
[281:07.22]Oh, what?
[281:07.88]Where are the invincibility frames?
[281:09.22]Do they exist?
[281:09.88]Do invincibility frames exist in this game?
[281:15.13]I don't think they do.
[281:34.63]I'm gonna end up standing in the fire.
[281:36.23]I don't even have a helmet on.
[281:37.29]I'm just completely naked.
[281:38.23]Eat this.
[281:39.65]Fuck you.
[281:49.06]Just combo him.
[281:52.36]I just kicked the shit out of him right there by just being a moron.
[282:01.39]This sucks so bad, naked.
[282:07.93]Ooh, he's a little bit vulnerable to this.
[282:09.21]Slow down.
[282:20.81]God damn it.
[282:22.09]Come on, this stupid fucking electricity.
[282:24.61]This is stupid.
[282:32.38]This is fucking dumb.
[282:37.02]Yeah, of course I am.
[282:38.52]He's almost dead.
[282:39.54]Remember your Dark Souls days.
[282:43.86]Well, apparently not, because I don't think they're in any invincibility dodge frames in this game.
[282:57.07]Hey, get pay to win, buddy.
[282:59.03]Yeah, you just lost.
[283:00.09]I just paid to kill you.
[283:05.84]No, that wasn't five dollars.
[283:27.06]That was like a dollar twenty-five.
[283:36.11]I missed a stamp.
[283:43.84]Could you be the chosen one?
[283:49.43]I deserve to be laughed at for this.
[283:54.27]What a passionless kick.
[284:02.07]The one problem that I see with this game is kind of the problem that I just ran into.
[284:06.79]Right.
[284:09.87]Where are the items?
[284:16.85]How could I be completely naked and no weapons and no armor?
[284:20.88]Like four hours into the game.
[284:23.58]Shit just breaks so easily that it's like you're just going to be naked the whole game.
[284:38.89]You need to get blueprints?
[284:40.41]Well, even... I got a bunch of blueprints.
[284:42.29]They were all for, like... They were for random armors that I couldn't even make.
[284:47.19]I couldn't... Guys, I don't have any cotton.
[284:50.23]There's no cotton.
[284:54.01]The online store.
[285:03.54]You have to farm for blueprints and gear.
[285:06.16]I mean, I get that to an extent, but... If playing without... I don't know.
[285:13.93]It just feels a little silly that my character, after this long of playing, even with buying in-game currency, I'm still just naked.
[285:33.58]Like, I went to that boss with a hammer and a mask on.
[285:37.05]And, like, there was no way.
[285:38.83]If I didn't have those two revives, or three revives, I never would have beat him.
[285:47.65]I'm just bad?
[285:48.59]No, I just don't have any gear.
[285:50.77]I'm just completely fucking nude.
[286:02.63]Permanently No, you're definitely bad
[286:29.16]So I have to go back to other levels, older levels.
[286:32.31]And grind them till I get blueprints.
[286:35.53]To have them be made.
[286:38.67]So I can put on armor in the game.
[286:41.93]Because the armor that you find on people lasts for less than one floor.
[286:51.76]You had, you unlocked ten armors and six weapons.
[287:03.02]This is a new area.
[287:10.98]Like a dungeon MMO.
[287:14.40]Still naked guy.
[287:16.14]Alright, well let me get the elevator and... I guess I'll go down and grind some... Let's try to get some blueprints.
[287:27.61]It's a free to play game, what did I expect?
[287:30.79]No, I'm not saying it's... I'm not, like, upset.
[287:34.21]I'm just... It's a little... I just find it a little ridiculous that there's a possibility that you could play as long as you have without really, you know, grinding and just be naked.
[287:43.26]Even if I had, like, shitty armor on.
[287:44.62]Nope, I'm just naked.
[287:51.20]I want to go down to the waiting room.
[287:58.18]Even if it was just, like, a loincloth and a, like, cone.
[288:02.75]Let me keep my cone.
[288:20.87]Back down we go.
[288:26.09]I mean, I guess the in-game currency is used for revives and for skipping build time.
[288:39.62]Whatever.
[288:41.26]I just don't want to be naked anymore.
[288:45.49]Level of grade 2 character.
[288:46.43]That's it.
[288:46.77]I was going to come down here and see if I could do that.
[288:54.21]Alright, so this guy's a level, a grade 1 character, so I can't get him higher than this.
[289:08.96]So, grade 2 character.
[289:12.08]Can't get even higher.
[289:12.88]Let's check it out.
[289:24.04]I need an empty slot standby.
[289:27.00]How do I... I think I can just trash him, right?
[289:31.68]Put him in like a... Yeah, go on an expedition.
[289:34.52]Who gives a shit about you?
[289:37.56]Go fight a... Rank four.
[289:42.57]We gotta find a rank one.
[289:43.91]Yeah, this guy.
[289:44.45]Go like raid this guy.
[289:47.25]Go there for 24 hours.
[289:51.91]Whatever that means.
[289:53.43]Good luck.
[289:58.62]I'm gonna do it with my gas mask.
[290:08.29]Uh... My what?
[290:20.80]Can I not make another guy?
[290:21.74]Because he's on a... Can I just...
[290:28.31]Fighter settings.
[290:29.35]Should I get rid of him?
[290:32.35]Except to destroy him, I think.
[290:33.42]You can buy more slots in defense setup.
[290:37.66]Let's do that.
[290:52.51]My team, ranking, report, raid, my waiting room.
[290:58.58]uh add fave start spot by equipment fighter freezer 2000. uh yes 30 minutes 30 minutes that's 30 minutes not 30 seconds right
[291:29.05]Because if it's 30 minutes, then we're gonna skip it.
[291:32.84]Bank.
[291:35.04]Number of fighters, three.
[291:36.76]Alright.
[291:38.08]We're gonna have to spend... Let's go.
[291:40.09]There goes another, like, 35 cents.
[291:45.31]Alright, let's go make a new guy.
[292:00.98]Empty fighter depot.
[292:02.84]Okay.
[292:03.16]Let's make a grade 2 guy and level him up.
[292:06.72]Finish playing Eerie.
[292:10.02]Grade 1.
[292:10.54]Grade 2.
[292:11.54]Striker, all-rounder, or collector.
[292:14.18]This guy can... Bag slot 19.
[292:17.13]Bag slot 33.
[292:17.65]That's so good.
[292:20.39]But look at this guy's strength.
[292:22.57]Yeah.
[292:23.03]Striker.
[292:23.37]I'm gonna do melee.
[292:24.39]Fuck that.
[292:31.43]This guy.
[292:35.95]Am I going to keep playing this game after today?
[292:37.35]I don't know.
[292:40.44]I don't really have a plan.
[292:41.34]I just wanted to try it.
[292:43.08]Because I was hearing people talking about it and it looked like it was kind of fun.
[292:45.50]Okay, there he is.
[292:52.22]Edmund.
[292:53.06]We're going to change this guy's name.
[292:58.90]Okay.
[292:59.34]I need a name.
[293:10.33]Gabbert.
[293:13.60]Change decal.
[293:14.60]He's got two decals.
[293:16.08]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[293:18.04]I guess I could take the decal off the other guy.
[293:21.63]Storage chest death bag.
[293:23.83]He's got really nothing.
[293:24.65]Okay.
[293:26.89]Um, let's select.
[293:27.77]Hold on.
[293:28.55]Can I take the decal off him?
[293:35.42]No, I know decal on that guy either.
[293:41.98]No, fuck it.
[293:42.38]Whatever.
[293:42.60]Let's just get him out here.
[293:46.42]Darren.
[293:51.98]Removing decals destroys them?
[293:53.34]Okay.
[293:54.10]Well, they're not that expensive.
[293:59.10]I gotta pee again.
[293:59.86]It's a level 1 Garrett.
[294:03.75]Striker.
[294:04.19]I don't think he has any experience, so I guess we have to just go down to, like, the... The first, like, handful of floors and do some grinding?
[294:12.51]Because this guy's up to... Okay, I get it.
[294:15.09]I get it.
[294:15.95]I get it.
[294:16.97]Not that much of a fan of that, but I understand how this works now.
[294:22.73]But, eh.
[294:24.46]Eh.
[294:26.38]Alright.
[294:26.74]Let me, uh... I'm gonna piss my pants.
[294:28.57]I'll be right back, guys.
[294:30.09]See you in a minute.
[296:05.03]I'm back.
[296:09.69]This guy can have two decals.
[296:12.78]Double decal, but before we go anywhere.
[296:15.82]Dat Gucci, thanks for the sub.
[296:17.68]Kaboosh47, thank you.
[296:19.68]Yurt McBob, thank you for the new subs.
[296:24.22]Fallen Aeon, or Fallen Aeon, thanks for three months.
[296:28.76]Muffin the Pyro, thank you for two months.
[296:30.65]Crocomire, got you already, but thanks again, Croc.
[296:33.93]Otto, come here.
[296:34.57]If you're gonna open the door, Otto, you gotta close it.
[296:37.77]How come you don't close the door, though?
[296:41.07]I just fell backwards in my chair.
[296:45.57]Well, I could've, like, just broke my arm right there, but whatever.
[296:50.62]Did you wash your hands?
[296:51.58]No, I didn't wash my hands, like I said, and I made chicken salad with my bare hands.
[296:58.48]And on the bit front, cigarette spaghetti during the fight 15 minutes ago.
[297:04.72]Thank you for the 10 bucks, dude.
[297:05.76]Remember your Dark Souls days?
[297:08.11]Take my energy.
[297:10.25]Well, Dark Souls didn't have comeback for free.
[297:14.61]At the same spot.
[297:16.73]Radio video, Lord Weebus.
[297:18.47]Thanks a lot, guys, for the bits.
[297:22.35]Much love, guys.
[297:24.81]And of course, Lala.
[297:27.34]Lala with another $30 from a while ago.
[297:29.70]Thanks a lot, guys.
[297:30.62]You guys rock.
[297:33.10]Back to work.
[297:34.62]Hey, remember what we just did?
[297:35.86]Let's do it all over again.
[297:36.80]Let's get some more decals.
[297:39.01]Alright, let's see.
[297:42.29]Recover 3% of damage dealt as HP.
[297:44.97]That's actually pretty great.
[297:57.67]This one's expensive.
[297:58.81]Hold out with one HP just once when taking fatal damage.
[298:06.90]I don't like that.
[298:07.44]Reduce falling damage.
[298:11.18]Dash and fatigue decreases.
[298:13.91]Well, I mean, Gymnast is just a guarantee on every single time.
[298:17.27]I like that, too.
[298:19.03]Attack by 7%.
[298:19.53]Ooh, I actually like this.
[298:23.63]Yeah, give me that one, too.
[298:24.93]Are you sure?
[298:27.21]yeah yeah are you sure are you sure are you sure alright cool are you sure now can anybody tell me what this actually does what does mushroom stew do and why is it 50 000 gold
[298:52.71]Uh, let's just go to level, like, three or four or something.
[299:10.28]Let's go to, like, level four.
[299:12.48]No, level three.
[299:17.62]Mushroom stew gives you permanent decals?
[299:21.12]Holy shit.
[299:23.13]Well.
[299:26.47]Alright.
[299:29.35]Bendyboy124, thanks for the sub.
[299:31.09]And Oxylism, thank you for the sub as well.
[299:36.63]So I guess you could just bank your gold and spend it on that.
[299:43.37]I'm going to say I'm recommending this game.
[299:45.59]I would absolutely recommend it.
[299:47.51]Because it's free.
[299:49.56]If you play this game for like an hour and you're like, ah, this game sucks and that's it, it's completely free.
[299:59.25]Nothing can be said by, I mean, maybe you'll just waste an hour or two of your time if you don't like what you're playing, but you don't have to spend any money.
[300:06.94]I still don't understand that lady.
[300:08.02]She's freaking me out.
[300:09.46]Okay.
[300:11.08]We're on floor three.
[300:11.86]We're just going to kill things.
[300:13.38]Doesn't matter where we go.
[300:16.14]We just have to fight enemies.
[300:22.64]Come on upstairs.
[300:23.62]That would be swell.
[300:26.35]Oh, you can run fast down here.
[300:38.68]How much did they pay me?
[300:40.72]Well, the company that made the game gave me... They gave me in-game currency and they gave me $5,000 to stream the game.
[300:48.23]So I got paid just about $5,000 to play.
[300:49.57]No.
[300:51.07]No.
[300:51.19]No, I just got it.
[300:51.77]I just got it.
[300:52.31]That was it.
[301:06.39]I'm losing one slot by using this, by the way.
[301:09.35]Dude, but I'm sure he'll be better eventually.
[301:14.01]Two times that much in bits.
[301:16.31]What the hell is he?
[301:18.85]He's making all kinds of noise.
[301:19.91]Of course he's right here.
[301:24.63]Now why did he... I love how he can attack through that, but I can't attack through this.
[301:29.25]Dog shit.
[301:29.77]Give me your head.
[301:34.51]Big money.
[301:42.42]Another hunter, great.
[301:43.30]What fucking level is he?
[301:46.50]19!
[301:46.68]Come on!
[301:48.30]Come on!
[301:50.02]At level 19 right here?
[301:52.84]And a bunch of assholes behind it.
[301:55.08]Well, this is gonna end in disaster.
[301:57.59]Son of a gun.
[302:16.05]This weapon is such a piece of shit, I don't even know why I'm using it.
[302:37.29]Get him!
[302:38.37]Oh, that was clutch.
[302:40.77]That was definitely clutch.
[302:49.35]That was so risky, but it was worth it.
[302:50.71]I hate this weapon.
[302:54.03]I don't know why I'm putting it on.
[302:58.49]Look at this conehead streamer.
[303:00.89]Yeah, what a conehead.
[303:01.67]What a blockhead.
[303:02.49]That was a dropkick into a backbreaker.
[303:12.14]Well, I could use a frog right now.
[303:20.40]That's such a little experience help point.
[303:25.19]I haven't been able to get to 50k because Californians keep raiding my base.
[303:31.60]What is it with California, man?
[303:32.88]Why are the Californians so evil?
[303:38.16]Nothing back here.
[303:52.21]I'd love more blueprints.
[303:59.05]Mastery level increases.
[304:00.23]Yeah.
[304:02.03]I just wish they stuck around for a little longer.
[304:06.91]It just feels like you get something and you're like, oh, a weapon!
[304:10.49]And after like five minutes, it's gone.
[304:13.21]That was fun for the ten minutes I had it.
[304:15.88]Or not even.
[304:16.54]Barely ten minutes.
[304:21.90]Okay.
[304:23.77]We'll find it.
[304:37.44]Take it.
[304:40.20]More fiber.
[304:44.42]You just shovel things in your underwear.
[304:46.00]Yeah, I've just been Mr. Speedo this whole time I've been playing.
[304:57.38]Yeah.
[304:57.94]Are you going to climb up here?
[304:59.14]I hope you do.
[304:59.76]Yes, you are.
[305:05.32]And you get the mastery for the different classes.
[305:10.94]Two regions can keep going after each other.
[305:16.45]I'm getting in the danger zone right now.
[305:20.67]Yeah!
[305:24.57]Yeah!
[305:43.64]Another iron!
[305:58.15]Was it worth it to create a completely new character?
[306:00.43]Uh, it was, only because you can level these.
[306:03.49]I got, because I got to the tenth floor, I was able to make a new character that was, could be leveled up more.
[306:17.39]That's really the only reason I'm doing this.
[306:18.85]Because this guy now has higher maximum stats allowed.
[306:24.81]Assuming I don't die down here.
[306:36.16]Rats give more than the frogs.
[306:44.52]The guy behind me.
[306:47.88]Yeah, he's got a gas mask on.
[306:52.69]He's different.
[306:54.45]He's completely different.
[307:06.08]The character I'm playing right now pretty much has the same stat line as my level 25.
[307:11.69]I don't like where you're sitting.
[307:14.09]Anybody else in this room?
[307:22.60]Oh, that... Oh, it broke.
[307:24.70]It broke.
[307:25.34]I would have dropkicked him, too.
[307:30.18]I'm down here?
[307:30.88]No, I just... Get back up.
[307:34.28]Bits are silly.
[307:35.02]Well, thank you, good boy.
[307:40.56]You're in such an awkward spot.
[307:41.70]Come on, stop.
[307:42.38]Move out of there.
[307:46.10]Now he went down.
[307:47.38]God damn it.
[307:50.54]God damn it.
[307:52.02]You piece of crap.
[307:56.18]He's freaking out.
[308:02.91]I'm just getting stun locked on him.
[308:04.31]Bad move.
[308:17.02]How much experience do I have?
[308:17.96]Can I see it somewhere?
[308:18.70]I love how it says last seen nine minutes ago.
[308:25.45]Where was I gonna go?
[308:27.95]Last seen.
[308:28.47]Does that mean like my body was seen somewhere?
[308:32.03]Do a plunging attack.
[308:34.07]How do you get that to work?
[308:34.93]Wasn't it X?
[308:37.15]I thought it was hanging over the edge and pressing X. Another deadly poison mushroom.
[308:47.15]Yeah, this is like a combination of Dark Souls, uh... Dark Souls, roguelike, random roguelike game, Clash of Clans, and every mobile game you've pretty much ever played.
[309:10.27]He did eat the poison mushroom.
[309:19.13]Yeah, Dead Rising, Dark Souls, and every mobile game ever made.
[309:24.53]Hunter has been sent.
[309:26.49]So somebody just sent a hunter after me.
[309:28.19]You really trying to fuck with me?
[309:30.05]I'm gonna kill you a hunter.
[309:30.91]No problem.
[309:33.55]Watch what happens when... Watch what happens when you try to fuck with Jerma Ida 5.
[309:36.37]See that frog?
[309:38.71]It's gonna be your hunter.
[309:40.51]That you just sent after me.
[309:42.61]You trying to make me rage?
[309:43.94]You trying to make me rage on my own stream?
[309:57.27]I believe this frog's down here.
[310:02.09]Screw driver.
[310:04.44]Is that better than what I have on?
[310:13.92]Yeah, you're like the exact same.
[310:15.86]Oh no, never mind.
[310:16.28]I thought I had the mask on still.
[310:19.09]Well, shit.
[310:21.09]Mmm.
[310:21.93]Eat another frog.
[310:26.94]Is Super Mario Run a good game?
[310:28.16]Has anybody played Super Mario Run?
[310:34.91]Seems like it could be interesting.
[310:53.58]Holy shit, guys.
[310:55.32]We actually found a piece of armor.
[310:57.54]I wonder how long it's gonna last on our body.
[310:59.00]And this is, like, different.
[310:59.78]This is a green coat.
[311:02.88]With batteries on it.
[311:03.66]Alright, say goodbye to this in 20 minutes.
[311:08.02]We'll be naked again very soon.
[311:26.35]There's always money in the boxes.
[311:35.17]Makes or breaks them.
[311:36.49]Oh god, I just smashed my microphone.
[311:39.61]I'm so sorry.
[311:40.33]For like two minutes.
[311:45.01]I have a blueprint.
[311:47.97]Look at the blueprints.
[311:56.64]That's a mushroom.
[311:57.34]Did I miss a box up here?
[312:06.35]I did.
[312:09.03]Climb up it.
[312:13.49]Is the world randomly generated?
[312:14.59]You know, I think somebody asked that earlier and I...
[312:19.94]I really don't even know.
[312:21.50]I've seen these same areas so many times that I kind of have no idea.
[312:26.56]Heavy hitter body.
[312:28.82]Holy shit.
[312:31.34]That's so much more armor.
[312:33.99]Store that.
[312:40.05]I just found an actually good piece of gear.
[312:46.85]Something else up there.
[312:52.72]Just a rock.
[312:56.21]Alright.
[312:56.47]Let's get out of here.
[312:57.43]I hear a rat.
[313:04.55]Or is it?
[313:10.14]There it is.
[313:11.72]Loot get.
[313:18.26]Alright.
[313:21.63]I hear someone.
[313:22.97]I hear multiple people.
[313:23.85]Should we poison somebody?
[313:32.10]That's the guy somebody sent to kill me.
[313:35.10]Hey, look.
[313:36.06]Doesn't that guy look familiar?
[313:38.66]A naked guy?
[313:39.40]Okay.
[313:42.12]Well, your naked guy is about to have a real bad day.
[313:51.07]Hopefully this cloud can hit him from here.
[313:56.43]Come on, stop being such a piece of crap.
[314:05.50]Get up there!
[314:07.36]Can you climb up?
[314:09.00]Climb up the fucking stairs, mate!
[314:12.42]Holy shit, man.
[314:13.72]That was so dumb.
[314:34.72]They all just kind of like yeah like freaked out and ran at me
[315:01.18]More armor.
[315:03.70]Slipped.
[315:05.28]Another piece of treasure in here.
[315:11.55]No blueprints, though.
[315:14.53]No blueprints.
[315:16.43]Just a bunch of dog shit.
[315:17.63]A bunch of fucking irons.
[315:20.95]If you're watching the VOD right now, those of you that are watching the VODs,
[315:27.67]How many irons do you think you've seen so far?
[315:30.39]If you have a VOD watcher, you're not watching it live.
[315:34.77]That's got to be iron number 75.
[315:40.42]Has to be.
[315:53.23]Maybe even more than that.
[315:58.74]It's just irons.
[316:00.04]It's just irons, lead pipes, and pickaxes.
[316:05.06]And the occasional buzzsaw.
[316:06.12]There are four items in this game.
[316:10.38]I saw a sword.
[316:11.43]It's level fucking 32.
[316:20.79]God damn it!
[316:26.74]And this person has a machine gun.
[316:31.35]Kill that guy so I don't have to deal with this shit.
[316:43.09]Oh!
[316:43.67]Didn't even stagger.
[316:44.40]Didn't even stagger.
[316:47.02]I can't even leave either.
[316:47.90]This sucks.
[316:50.80]You know what?
[316:51.08]I'm going to let you deal with that room.
[316:54.60]You fight everything in there.
[316:56.60]You deal with it.
[317:01.79]Go in the other room.
[317:02.41]Go in that room.
[317:03.21]Where that person is with the machine gun.
[317:04.79]Fight her.
[317:06.83]Don't fight me.
[317:07.91]Fight her.
[317:08.93]She's almost dead, I think.
[317:14.34]Anything in here that I can just take?
[317:15.52]No.
[317:15.58]Watch out for the tiny fires.
[317:22.49]Can you guys do something besides stand there and squawk like birds?
[317:28.43]It's broken.
[317:30.05]I hit one fucking person.
[317:33.14]I hit one person with that pickaxe and it's destroyed.
[317:39.48]Don't ever let your guard down again!
[317:48.35]Fuck!
[317:59.15]I'm actually getting real, real tired of these level 32s coming to the second floor when I have a level 1.
[318:04.32]Well, let's go.
[318:19.43]Nothing else.
[318:22.65]Punches.
[318:24.93]I get foreign when I get mad.
[318:26.23]They don't speak English anymore apparently when I get angry.
[318:30.81]Not even angry, I was just surprised and scared that I was gonna get one hit killed by a level 32 hunter.
[318:34.97]I'm going for a punch.
[318:44.36]He's gonna come around the corner.
[318:45.10]I'm gonna blast him right in his mouth.
[318:50.02]Well, he came around the corner.
[318:50.90]I just didn't get him.
[319:00.25]Yeah, that means I'm better than that.

[321:54.36]No.
[321:56.89]That was so distracting.
[321:58.34]I couldn't even play games.
[322:00.34]Paul Bearer was just like constantly yelling at me.
[322:03.28]At least during the initial time he was there.
[322:06.64]Uh, thank you, Sadal, for the bits.
[322:08.52]Never trust a purple.
[322:09.06]Thank you for the five bucks, Jeremy Irons, like I said.

[322:39.41]What do I do?
[322:40.69]Fuck, I'm going back now.
[322:48.99]Use it as a bit sound.
[322:51.05]Well, once this channel... Snot stream.
[323:02.51]Jeremy, are you okay?
[323:05.19]What the fuck are you doing?
[323:08.15]You are scary.
[323:15.33]There's going to be server maintenance in 10 minutes for this game?
[323:19.47]No.
[323:20.75]Don't say that.
[323:21.37]Are you talking with a mouthful of Cheez Whiz?
[323:26.72]I kind of wish I had Cheez Whiz right now.
[323:36.72]Wait, what?
[323:37.96]I don't have any food in my fridge.
[323:39.06]I've got to go grocery shopping.
[323:45.83]Alright, how much experience did I get?
[323:54.50]Did I blow my nose in the microphone?
[323:55.80]No, that was with my mouth.
[323:59.68]Alright.
[324:01.16]Can I level up?
[324:02.24]Let's see.
[324:02.88]Oh, god, man.
[324:04.06]Look at this.
[324:04.48]I can level up so many times.
[324:09.45]Let's be smart here.
[324:10.13]HP...
[324:15.08]Strength.
[324:16.90]We are going to be a complete beast now.
[324:20.74]We'll go for... No, we'll go with... Yeah, I like that.
[324:29.34]Now, my guy is kind of insane.
[324:35.25]Just pay the 50 cents to buy the maintenance.
[324:38.13]That's a lot more health.
[324:43.33]Wet food?
[324:44.05]Oh, you guys, we're gonna get wet food tonight.
[324:48.42]Here's your blueprint.
[324:51.54]Welcome.
[324:53.70]Dude, I'm so glad that I have no weapon blueprints or anything.
[324:57.54]I had that one sword.
[324:58.36]That one sword was awesome like four hours ago.
[325:00.61]Alright.
[325:03.11]Research and development.
[325:04.63]Let's just do... Okay, I actually have cotton.
[325:08.67]Why did I get cotton this time?
[325:12.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[325:15.11]You're telling me that over the course of almost five hours playing the game on the other character, I did not find one piece of cotton.
[325:22.34]I go through the first levels once, and I get three cotton.
[325:28.71]What the fuck is this game talking about?
[325:30.13]Okay, well, let's... What bloop did I already have?
[325:40.15]Let's plus four.
[325:44.28]Oh, this is 43-43.
[325:45.22]Both of them are exactly the same.
[325:47.43]This one has higher... This one's actually a little bit better.
[325:52.67]Eh, make this one.
[325:58.56]One minute attack of pants.
[326:01.04]Trucker pants.
[326:05.76]Both 30 defense.
[326:08.66]Five, five, five, nine.
[326:10.66]Poison.
[326:11.18]This one is... I like these trucker pants.
[326:13.86]Make these.
[326:16.04]Did you store it in your bank?
[326:17.41]No, I just never got them.
[326:23.77]And we'll make the... No, I'm going to hold.
[326:26.09]Should I put another point into one of these when they're done?
[326:28.58]Maybe do like a level up on one of them?
[326:38.72]The first weapon blueprint I got was for the Iron Hammer.
[326:40.74]You should have got it by now.
[326:41.68]I just haven't even seen it.
[326:45.60]We're going to wait for 60 seconds.
[326:47.50]And then we're going to do this again on this one and upgrade it.
[326:52.70]Not short shorts.
[326:56.04]Hey, look, it's done.
[326:58.24]Let's get this to +2 so we can always have a decent piece of armor.
[327:03.87]Now we won't be naked forever.
[327:09.02]Why are people casting sus right now?
[327:10.68]The stream is currently live.
[327:11.98]I'm gonna wait the couple minutes that it takes for that to happen.
[327:19.12]I'm not gonna spend anything.
[327:21.70]In the meantime... No, I don't need to talk to you.
[327:29.46]There really is maintenance.
[327:30.54]There actually is server maintenance.
[327:36.05]Server maintenance that wasn't just a stupid wow joke that somebody made I didn't even see that Wow maintenance I Thought you guys are just fucking kidding No, I don't want to stop playing right now I
[328:00.25]Alright, I'm going to play like a different game then.
[328:02.86]While the server... No, maybe I should just call it a night.
[328:06.94]I'm not done with this game though.
[328:08.54]I'm not done with this game.
[328:13.02]You will see this game again because we're just barely getting to the interesting part.
[328:18.47]Like six hours into the game.
[328:22.19]Right when I like figure out
[328:25.15]how to play the game and like get my bearings and like aren't like a total moron the servers go down well it's not it is online only play until I get disconnected was it what was that was that a minute or was that 40 minutes well we have to wait around for the stupid shirt to be made anyways
[328:55.02]Is our shirt ready yet?
[328:58.70]Or what?
[328:59.64]Alright, it's done.
[329:01.70]Alright, bye.
[329:02.42]We're gonna buy... How much better is this than the helmet I have on?
[329:05.61]Should I buy more than one of these?
[329:09.61]I'm gonna buy a couple of them.
[329:16.97]Yeah, I have money.
[329:18.01]Just spend it.
[329:22.86]Don't go into the tower before maintenance.
[329:26.67]It's probably a bad idea, you're right.
[329:31.47]Come back anytime.
[329:32.51]Let's equip this stuff and see how much better it is.
[329:36.09]Dr. Drill Mask is the... Okay, I'm currently... Yeah, I have this shitty... I have a plus three.
[329:43.50]I put that on.
[329:43.98]19 out of 43.
[329:45.36]This one's so much better, but...
[329:51.38]Yeah, this one is definitely good.
[329:52.90]Put that on.
[329:53.56]It's just a stupid raincoat, but it's okay.
[329:57.55]Put it on.
[329:59.77]And, hey, would you look at that, guys?
[330:02.29]I actually, for the first time, have a full set of gear on.
[330:07.39]It's still dirty and shitty, but it's still here.
[330:09.07]You know anything in my reward box?
[330:20.20]What is this?
[330:23.63]Hernia.
[330:26.59]Vending machine that stocks convenient items.
[330:32.33]Okay.
[330:35.79]So this is like a homeward bone.
[330:38.75]This trip tonight.
[330:40.01]Trip to mine.
[330:43.67]Meat potion.
[330:44.37]50% of the fighter.
[330:45.47]Okay.
[330:46.05]These are probably expensive.
[330:47.89]Full potions.
[330:48.79]Let's see how much money these are.
[330:56.50]It's a 20,000.
[330:57.20]Hold on a minute.
[331:00.78]You can't be serious, game.
[331:09.83]Sell all these dumb irons.
[331:11.19]Okay, wait a second.
[331:16.65]Wait a second.
[331:18.75]Did that just tell me that one of these potions...
[331:23.11]Is 20,000 gold.
[331:24.31]Are these reusable?
[331:30.48]Because if they're not reusable, that is nonsense.
[331:34.70]I'm not going to buy one of those.
[331:45.97]The song playing in your game is playing in mine.
[331:52.40]It's like a radio.
[331:55.38]Where can I see the maintenance?
[331:56.82]Let's just... I don't know what to do here.
[332:01.82]Let's just go in and see what happens.
[332:03.28]Maybe we don't lose all of our progress.
[332:09.53]20k is not a lot late game.
[332:12.01]I guess that makes sense.
[332:14.95]Should I do this or am I going to get fucked over by the maintenance?
[332:18.72]What level am I?
[332:20.48]Level 11.
[332:22.10]Go to, like, floor 4 or 5.
[332:26.98]I'd pay 20,000 for wet food.
[332:31.02]It will kill me.
[332:31.75]Okay.
[332:36.63]Alright, well, then in that case, I'm not done streaming this game, by the way.
[332:43.03]I'm going to, I guess, call it there.
[332:48.85]For now.
[332:51.07]Goodbye, rank two character.
[332:54.22]No, I'll stream this game again.
[332:56.52]I got a plan for next week.
[332:57.36]Maybe at some point I'll turn this back on and we can try this again.
[333:03.52]Give me one second.
[333:07.96]Let me change this.
[333:10.94]So if you came here to watch this game, I'm going to stop playing it.

[334:02.62]I don't think I have Stardew on PS4.
[334:03.76]Because right now the stream is set up to ingest PlayStation 4.
[334:10.18]I can't really change it right now.
[334:12.91]For me to do a PC game, I'd have to turn off the stream.
[334:18.17]So, let's just see what we got.
