[00:12.34]Hold on.
[00:12.64]Alright, I'm about to start talking.
[00:16.34]Oh my god, what did you just- What have you done?
[00:23.47]What have you done?
[00:24.47]Alright, apologies.
[00:26.33]Apologies.
[00:28.13]Hey everybody, get out of the way!
[00:30.25]Hey!
[00:32.34]Hey everybody, what's going on?
[00:34.24]It's Jerma the Cactus here.
[00:36.74]Oh, that's a tree.
[00:38.12]Oh, let's switch now.
[00:39.28]Hey, what's up everybody?
[00:40.34]Jerma here, and Etalyx and MLC_St3alth.
[00:44.05]Welcome to Timed Chaos Build, where we build crazy stuff in a timed amount of time.
[00:49.77]And you two introduce yourself.
[00:50.99]I know they know who you guys are, but still, could be fun.
[00:54.59]I am Etalyx, and my channel is Gamers Descent, and you've probably seen me with Jerma and Minecraft shenanigans previously.
[01:03.02]Woohoo!
[01:04.22]Alright, where's MLC_St3alth?
[01:05.12]Where are you?
[01:05.78]I'm right here.
[01:06.64]I just found this guy.
[01:08.71]Mine is MLC_St3alth.
[01:11.45]Hey, stop it.
[01:12.42]Stop breaking stuff.
[01:14.12]People are going to see the pit that was hidden under here that we just patched up.
[01:17.68]We're like kid bodies.
[01:19.22]Children bodies.
[01:20.73]Alright, so if you're not familiar how this works, I'm a magician, okay.
[01:24.89]If you're not familiar how this works, we time ourselves.
[01:27.86]It's going to be eight minutes this time.
[01:30.46]And we're going to try and build a horse in eight minutes in today's episode.
[01:34.14]And once eight minutes is up, we have to stop.
[01:36.58]Hands up in the air.
[01:37.58]We can't do anything else.
[01:38.50]So let's get this started.
[01:39.99]Are you guys ready to build a horse?
[01:41.77]We're ready.
[01:42.29]Yes.
[01:43.59]So on the count of three, eight minutes, three, two, one, go.
[01:51.49]Alright.
[01:52.24]Hooves should be black, right?
[01:53.78]Start with the feet.
[01:56.14]So the horse is going to be brown.
[01:58.23]Yeah, the horse will be brown.
[01:59.23]This is gonna be a huge freaking horse, man.
[02:01.45]That's a pretty big hoof.
[02:02.97]Alright, that is a big hoof.
[02:04.43]You need four of those?
[02:05.47]That's a big hoof, yeah.
[02:06.75]Hold on, I'm trying to figure out, like... Should we do this?
[02:10.91]He's gonna have, like, skeletal legs.
[02:12.84]Alright, so we got... Wait, wait.
[02:16.92]The front two... Wait, should they be staggered, like he's walking?
[02:20.20]Yeah.
[02:21.36]Too complicated?
[02:23.54]I think he should just be relaxing.
[02:25.42]Alright, just, like, standing at attention.
[02:28.12]Reading the Sunday newspaper.
[02:31.43]Are those too close together?
[02:33.11]I'll get this leg.
[02:35.77]I think they're okay.
[02:41.27]I'm waking this leg is way too... This is going to be a huge creation.
[02:47.48]We only have like seven minutes left.
[02:50.26]Go, go, go.
[02:51.38]No more dilly-dallying.
[02:52.85]Okay, maybe not.
[02:55.72]Legs go straight up for a little while.
[02:57.36]Yours doesn't.
[02:58.74]No, it's okay.
[03:00.22]It's okay.
[03:00.64]He has a broken leg.
[03:01.56]Don't worry.
[03:03.20]What the crap is going on here?
[03:04.85]Okay.
[03:05.87]And now it's his body.
[03:08.03]Alright, so you close the body together.
[03:10.49]Oh my god, dude.
[03:12.03]This is going to be the derpiest horse I've ever seen.
[03:19.73]Hurry up.
[03:20.39]We don't have time.
[03:21.59]Mine doesn't have any knees.
[03:23.49]Just go.
[03:24.43]We don't have time for this.
[03:27.54]It's just going like straight up.
[03:29.80]It's going to be like a stick figure horse.
[03:32.52]There's no time.
[03:33.24]We kind of just have to build it.
[03:39.50]Oh my god, why did we make the legs so big?
[03:41.48]We're never gonna finish this.
[03:43.58]Mine's kinda like... Mine's like sprouting fat.
[03:46.40]Oh my gosh!
[03:47.08]This is gonna be huge!
[03:49.12]This is gonna be enormous.
[03:52.00]Whoa, I didn't... First of all, his body can't come out further than his legs.
[03:59.13]Oh god, that's why.
[04:00.63]He's so short.
[04:01.83]This is the shortest horse I've ever seen.
[04:06.11]This is like a wiener dog horse.
[04:12.17]We're making a dachshund.
[04:15.12]Alright, we can change animals.
[04:17.78]We can change animals midway.
[04:19.26]It's okay.
[04:20.40]We gotta stick to the guns, man.
[04:21.82]It's gotta be a horse.
[04:23.52]What's the deciding factor that makes it not a dog and makes it a horse?
[04:27.79]A long face.
[04:28.93]Actually, a dachshund has a long face, too.
[04:32.77]Oh, that's not gonna work, Ben.
[04:35.05]We put an apple in its mouth.
[04:36.31]No, we're messing around.
[04:38.05]We gotta get the body done.
[04:39.19]Alright, am I allowed to make it daytime again?
[04:41.33]Uh, yes.
[04:43.41]Alright.
[04:46.00]Alright, done.
[04:46.40]Dude, this is not even... Why is his leg so skinny?
[04:52.70]Dude, he's got... He's like Tiny Tim.
[04:57.90]Alright, I'm working on the belly.
[05:02.89]I'll work on the head.
[05:03.63]I'll work on the head.
[05:06.41]I was also going to work on the belly.
[05:07.93]Too late.
[05:08.35]I'm already doing it.
[05:09.98]How am I gonna make this?
[05:11.00]I have no idea what I'm doing, man.
[05:13.04]I have absolutely no idea.
[05:14.44]Alright, work on his back.
[05:15.42]He's gotta have, like, an arched back.
[05:18.54]He's gotta be, like, round.
[05:19.66]He can't be flat.
[05:20.46]Dude, if this thing was alive, it would come alive and just be like, Please kill me.
[05:25.59]Please.
[05:26.75]Please kill me.
[05:27.85]This is like an anteater.
[05:35.25]We gotta put like a sat on it I'm laughing too much.
[05:42.55]I can't do this.
[05:53.05]It looks like, it looks like a really derpy camel.
[05:56.13]It's like a really flat camel.
[06:02.44]It's like a, this is like a truck disguised as a camel.
[06:08.90]It's like, this is like a Trojan horse camel.

[06:13.09]Oh, my whole body hurts right now.
[06:17.39]He really is a camel.
[06:19.51]Oh, my God.
[06:20.84]How do you make a horse's face?
[06:23.20]I don't know how.
[06:23.98]Etalyx, you're like the smart one.
[06:26.06]Get over here.
[06:27.44]I don't know how to make a horse's face.
[06:30.28]Alright, finish the belly.
[06:31.30]Make the belly round.
[06:32.76]So you can just look at it.
[06:33.36]Four minutes and forty seconds.
[06:34.94]Ugh.
[06:35.76]Alright, how do you make a horse's face?
[06:37.28]Alright, is this the face?
[06:39.16]This is... Yeah.
[06:40.92]This is not a horse.
[06:44.16]This is like a... I don't know what this is.
[06:46.61]It's... It's... He needs a neck.
[06:49.81]He has no neck.
[06:50.39]It's like Snoopy.
[06:51.59]He's got no neck, dude.
[06:54.67]It just... Fix it.
[06:56.75]Fix it.

[07:03.16]That's what I'm doing.
[07:05.58]We gotta put a door on this thing.
[07:07.14]It's basically like a house.
[07:10.92]I can't even do it.
[07:13.40]What are you doing?
[07:15.12]I'm destroying it.
[07:17.04]There was no neck there, dude.
[07:18.90]There's no time for destroying.
[07:20.44]There's no time.
[07:21.32]Watch.
[07:21.78]Watch me.
[07:22.68]I've got time.

[09:59.10]I don't know.
[10:00.42]He turned it into a bull?
[10:01.60]I don't know.
[10:03.22]I don't know what that is.
[10:06.52]Well, he looks alright to me.
[10:08.32]What is this in the front?
[10:09.14]Somebody like broke his leg right here.
[10:11.16]Somebody took a baseball bat and just... Somebody just like carved his whole front muscle up.
[10:22.11]This is possibly the worst cow.
[10:23.09]He's got a big wart back here.
[10:27.01]What is this mouth?
[10:28.01]What's the deal with this huge mouth in the front?
[10:30.74]He's chewing.
[10:32.20]Oh, there's the apple.
[10:33.82]Okay.
[10:34.92]Alright, so, we're gonna name him something, of course, as tradition.
[10:41.74]Okay, his mouth and his face looks like the grandpa, like, thumbnail face.
[10:45.97]I say we just call him Brokeback, because that's what he looks like to me.
[10:49.97]Brokeback.
[10:51.51]And, oh, and we have to, in the comments section, give him a name if you want.
[10:56.00]And, of course, give us a rating, 1 out of 10, because that's the way we roll.
[11:02.65]So yeah, I guess that's gonna wrap it up, guys.
[11:05.12]So this is his... We're gonna give this guy like a whole farm of animals.
[11:08.52]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[11:09.40]Are we allowed to make modifications here to this guy?
[11:12.04]To Gregory, don't hurt him.
[11:13.86]No modifications allowed.
[11:15.55]Can we delete the modifications?
[11:16.65]He needs a cowboy hat to go with his... That's his chef's hat.
[11:25.07]Look, what is with this guy's eyes, man?
[11:26.81]Seriously, that's, like, five different types of drugs in his bloodstream.
[11:30.79]Yeah, those are, like, when you go to get ice cream from the, like, guy who's driving around the, like, street, you get, like, a Bugs Bunny character, and he has those, like, oogly-googly yellow eye gumdrop things on the ice cream.
[11:41.67]Oh, my God.
[11:42.33]That's what it is.
[11:42.71]You are absolutely correct.
[11:44.21]Wow, that's awesome.
[11:45.81]Alright, well, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[11:47.58]Thanks so much for watching, and, of course, take care, everybody.
[11:50.92]Thanks for watching.
[11:53.28]What's that do?
[11:54.62]Hey, off.
