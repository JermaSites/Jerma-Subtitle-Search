[00:38.36]Hello, everybody.
[00:41.50]We're a little early today.
[00:45.10]That's okay.
[00:48.28]Got a fun game, probably, to play here tonight.
[00:50.97]Might be fun.
[00:55.47]Depends.
[00:57.93]Far Cry 5.
[01:00.51]With Etalyx.
[01:02.59]Second Etalyx stream in a row.
[01:04.67]Our good friend.
[01:05.45]There he is.
[01:12.24]We've got an EU-friendly stream here.
[01:15.28]An EU-friendly stream is when it's, you know, maybe 5 after, 10 after midnight EU time.
[01:27.83]But he's also starting his stream up now.
[01:30.31]We're just going to chill until he is ready.
[01:33.98]Might be a minute.
[01:34.92]Might be two minutes.
[01:35.64]It might be right now.
[01:37.48]I cannot predict his movements.
[01:43.80]But give me a minute, we'll get started.
[01:46.65]See you in a few.
[02:18.10]Oh, by the way, while I have you here for a minute, before the stream really starts, the detective find me in chat stream is not going to happen on Friday.
[02:31.24]Something else is going to happen this weekend.
[02:36.15]Something I've been working on here for a little bit.
[02:38.67]That's going to probably be... We're still doing it probably next week.
[02:42.95]You will not be disappointed on what's taking its place.
[02:45.57]I can promise you that.
[02:50.68]Yeah, the accusation stream is still... We just barely got the bot that Skip made it.
[02:58.79]And it works pretty well.
[02:59.77]We just got that completely solidified.
[03:02.72]But, um... Stay tuned for this weekend.
[03:07.44]Some fun stuff might happen.
[03:09.61]I don't know.
[03:10.05]I don't know.
[03:11.48]I haven't been told anything.
[03:12.28]All I've been told is, tell them that there might be something fun on, like, Friday or Saturday.
[03:16.20]And I'm like, fuck.
[03:17.46]I don't know.
[03:17.86]It's like, it's not like I run the channel or anything.
[03:20.14]Like, I don't know.
[03:20.78]But yes.
[03:27.14]Don't miss Friday's stream.
[03:28.14]That's all I'm going to tell you.
[03:37.26]So, we're waiting for Italic still.
[03:40.36]What is he doing?
[03:48.90]What is he doing?
[03:55.75]He ditched me.
[03:56.57]What if he was playing his own game of Far Cry?
[03:59.27]That'd be pretty funny.
[04:03.17]He didn't actually want to play multiplayer.
[04:05.77]Well, I mean, we're here.
[04:07.09]Might as well just go like this and show you that the game actually does exist.
[04:10.27]See?
[04:13.13]We do have a real video game here.
[04:16.37]Keep this right here.
[04:19.50]This is Far Cry 5.
[04:20.76]As you can see, there are weapons in this game.
[04:26.74]There are couches.
[04:27.52]There are boxes.
[04:42.49]Hello?
[04:43.75]Is anybody home?
[04:45.59]My whole OBS crashed.
[04:47.08]Don't you try and smack me.
[04:49.46]I just had to restart my stream.
[04:51.00]OBS died.
[04:51.60]I saw that.
[04:54.32]Can you hear me?
[04:56.20]Can you hear me now?
[04:57.74]Are you around?
[04:58.36]Hello?
[04:59.06]Unmute yourself.
[05:00.22]Am I muted?
[05:00.72]Can you hear me?
[05:02.50]What the fuck is going on?
[05:04.85]Oh my god.
[05:05.57]Hello?
[05:06.83]Yeah, hello.
[05:07.45]You're on stream.
[05:08.39]OBS crashed like fucking 30 seconds after I turned the stream on.
[05:13.14]Well, you're on stream.
[05:15.02]Am I live right now?
[05:16.60]You're live right now.
[05:17.62]I'm terrified to do anything else ever again now.
[05:21.26]Dude, alright.
[05:21.96]This is a good start to the stream.
[05:24.30]Do we make the joke all the time?
[05:26.26]But for real?
[05:26.92]Seriously?
[05:27.62]How long are we sitting here testing to make sure this worked?
[05:30.05]Like recording and make sure stream settings are correct?
[05:33.09]At least two hours.
[05:34.77]I can't even fucking believe it.
[05:36.97]Literally within two minutes the stream crashed.
[05:39.95]Yeah, we were absolutely here for like two hours.
[05:42.69]Like, not even the game, OBS crashed.
[05:45.18]Yeah.
[05:46.64]Well, at least it's not Ubisoft's fault, I guess.
[05:48.34]No, it wasn't Ubisoft's fault this time, but that scares the shit out of me for, like, the next 10, 20 minutes.
[05:54.66]So are you back on?
[05:56.16]I'm back on, yeah.
[05:57.58]Okay.
[05:58.46]Hopefully, I think I'm live.
[06:00.76]Alright.
[06:01.96]It looks like we are.
[06:02.94]So, hey, welcome to Far Cry 5.
[06:04.38]Yeah.
[06:06.06]You know, we even went so far as to make sure when we start the stream that we can get right into co-op.
[06:11.74]Yeah, we are in co-op mode.
[06:13.66]As you may remember, that was problematic in the Far Cry 4 stream.
[06:17.68]Is this game good or not?
[06:19.00]We don't know.
[06:19.89]This is the first time we've ever played it, besides the first, like, 40-minute tutorial.
[06:23.49]Yeah, I give the tutorial a tutorial out of tutorial.
[06:26.71]Alright, so what's the goal here?
[06:28.19]What are we going to try to do here?
[06:29.96]We can do anything that we want in the entire game.
[06:33.95]Really?
[06:35.33]Yeah.
[06:35.67]Oh, we can do anything.
[06:37.19]Open the map, zoom all the way out, and decide where we want to go, or we can just hijack a car and drive until we find something interesting.
[06:45.79]Let's just do, like, the first mission.
[06:47.53]Doesn't that sound like a good idea?
[06:49.79]That's the thing.
[06:50.37]The first mission is wherever you want to go.
[06:52.65]Really?
[06:53.45]Yeah, like, if you... I see the orb.
[06:56.18]Oh.
[06:57.28]Yeah, if you zoom out...
[06:59.30]to any of those three regions and you just kind of decide which one you want to do first.
[07:03.44]Alright, well, let's let's just let's go.
[07:07.13]Let's go.
[07:07.45]The world is our oyster, as they say.
[07:09.03]Let's get it.
[07:09.45]Let's get out.
[07:09.85]Let's get off this island first.
[07:11.19]And we're going to get off the I said we're going this way.
[07:16.63]205 meters this way.
[07:19.49]Sounds about right.
[07:21.55]Can you see my that's my icon.
[07:24.41]Yeah, I can see your waypoint.
[07:26.01]OK.
[07:28.98]The real question is, you can throw shit in this game, but how far can you throw it?
[07:32.52]Well, that was dynamite.
[07:36.63]I thought I was throwing the ore.
[07:40.37]Imagine that was the ore.
[07:41.97]How far can I throw the ore?
[07:43.15]Did I catch it?
[07:43.61]Oh my god.
[07:43.97]My OBS is dying again.
[07:58.13]Ayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayay
[08:29.11]I'm not even sure if Etalyx can hear me right now.
[08:31.67]Yeah, three streams in one day.
[08:41.46]Can you hear me?
[08:43.00]Why can he not hear me?
[08:44.14]Why is it muting my microphone when my stream crashes?
[08:50.06]Is it like a problem right now with OBS and TeamSpeak?
[08:53.86]What the fuck is happening?
[08:55.18]There seems to be some kind of...
[08:58.95]interaction between the two but yeah you've been muted since I guess you crashed again and there's a zombie there's a lady dancing in a mist of green well you know what's really funny we were talking about how your computer might not be able to do this and then all of a sudden my computer doesn't want to work yeah my computer was the problem god I'm sick of listening to this lady talk
[09:22.15]I think she's a good... Is she a good guy?
[09:23.63]Is this an NPC?
[09:24.01]No, that's the bad guy.
[09:25.05]That's like the sister.
[09:25.75]Wait, this is the bad guy.
[09:26.67]This is the boss.
[09:27.57]Oh, she's gone.
[09:28.50]Oh, she was just a... She was just a illusion the whole time.
[09:33.90]Yeah, but there's like illusion dust over here.
[09:35.82]Okay, interesting.
[09:40.97]Eight seeds.
[09:41.49]Yeah, so we're in her region now, right?
[09:45.19]This may be problematic.
[09:47.21]What do you mean?
[09:48.65]Uh, well...
[09:51.87]You know, the dying thing.
[09:53.38]Oh.
[09:54.32]The guy is killing me thing.
[09:56.74]Sorry, I'm just trying to... Wait, I thought I just picked up your body.
[09:59.80]What?
[10:00.68]No, you have another guy.
[10:02.48]Revive this guy.
[10:04.56]I want to revive the right one.
[10:05.59]Thanks, bud.
[10:06.53]Your face looks terrible.
[10:08.37]It looks purely awful.
[10:10.03]There's currently a Zippo lighter coming to get us.
[10:12.95]What's going to happen here?
[10:15.01]There's a lot of people.
[10:20.80]What?
[10:22.12]Where's that guy?
[10:22.64]That guy's got places to be.
[10:23.94]Okay, that guy doesn't obviously care.
[10:25.66]Alright, well, anyways.
[10:30.01]Let's loot these guys.
[10:31.23]And you want to get on the fun car?
[10:33.23]The ATV?
[10:34.87]Of course.
[10:35.85]So are you live again or no?
[10:36.91]Yeah, I'm live again, I guess, for now.
[10:39.07]Alright.
[10:40.23]So where do you want to go?
[10:42.77]I want to go wherever your heart desires.
[10:45.13]Throw can?
[10:47.25]Oh, boy, that's great.
[10:49.92]Okay, auto-drive is on.
[10:50.86]That's a new toy already.
[10:52.94]The car can drive itself?
[10:54.06]Holy shit, we're in the future.
[10:54.92]I guess it can drive it, but I don't... There is a roadblock ahead, so I don't know how it handles the roadblock situation.
[10:59.46]I'll take care of it.
[11:02.84]I scared him away.
[11:03.41]That guy's got an RPG in your can, scared him away.
[11:05.39]Dude, they're just like birds, don't worry.
[11:09.45]Got him.
[11:09.69]Why is auto... There's no signal.
[11:16.41]I don't have a signal?
[11:19.28]He's right in my blind spot.
[11:20.77]I'm turning.
[11:21.23]I can't.
[11:21.67]Let's go this way.
[11:24.01]Where are we?
[11:24.81]We're here.
[11:26.59]We are like a step away from the spawn.
[11:28.93]Yeah, we're a step away from the spawn.
[11:31.31]And dying.
[11:33.15]Alright, let me get out of here.
[11:34.13]This is some nice backward and forward driving that you got going here.
[11:37.95]Where you just bump into something.
[11:39.53]Where are we going?
[11:40.33]Where do you want to go?
[11:41.13]I don't know.
[11:42.31]Just go to that green exclamation to the left.
[11:45.43]Green exclamation.
[11:46.35]Yeah, like right there.
[11:49.49]I can throw cans, too.
[11:50.67]You throw cans to what you're talking about, because I don't see a green exclamation mark.
[11:54.23]Just keep driving.
[11:55.20]There's a cougar.
[11:57.46]Look at how much faster the cougar is than us.
[11:59.20]It's so much faster.
[12:00.06]Why did he stop?
[12:05.40]There's a dead guy on the side of the road.
[12:07.14]Why did he stop, though, for real?
[12:08.68]I don't know.
[12:09.58]He just saw you coming, and he deferred.
[12:13.64]Why would you do that?
[12:15.12]Why would you turn into me?
[12:16.24]That's a good guy.
[12:16.90]That's a civilian.
[12:17.93]Okay.
[12:18.39]He's on our side.
[12:21.37]Alright, uh, I see explosions.
[12:25.09]There are some bad guys ahead.
[12:27.19]Right there.
[12:28.36]Look at the flamethrower.
[12:29.40]Look at the flamethrower.
[12:31.90]Oops.
[12:32.56]I got too busy looking at stuff behind me.
[12:36.08]That's what auto-drive is there for.
[12:38.01]Can we please just mark something on the map to go to?
[12:40.65]Okay.
[12:40.87]Because we're kind of just driving for no reason.
[12:43.25]Look, just... How about... Just stop right here.
[12:50.33]Right here.
[12:50.81]Right here.
[12:52.05]You think there's an E3 presentation here?
[12:53.07]Okay.
[12:53.19]Interesting.
[13:14.28]So let's just go to this big red blankie.
[13:16.86]Well, watch out.
[13:17.44]Use stealth.
[13:19.24]Oh, well, he already sees us.
[13:21.20]Yeah, but he sees you.
[13:22.20]He doesn't see me.
[13:25.22]That's true.
[13:25.90]That's true.
[13:26.40]I am army of twoing you right now.
[13:27.80]Yeah, he doesn't see me.
[13:31.77]How do you throw the weapons?
[13:34.27]Right click.
[13:37.09]Who's even shooting?
[13:39.62]That guy.
[13:41.40]That guy.
[13:42.34]What else do I have?
[13:43.22]Oh, I have, like, a pipe?
[13:46.93]Got him.
[13:47.15]Is there any more stuff I can throw?
[13:49.55]Oh, there's a newspaper.
[13:52.83]Can I throw the lantern?
[13:56.19]Hey, we got it.
[13:57.37]We're at the outpost.
[13:58.51]We're at the Garden View Packing Facility.
[14:01.96]You've got, like, three guys right next to you.
[14:04.92]Oh, I do.
[14:05.42]You're right.
[14:09.59]Wow, I don't know how to shoot arrows from this far.
[14:11.37]Fix the FOV, it's at 95.
[14:16.01]Or just die.
[14:17.61]I just ran into a beehive.
[14:20.78]I have to swat bees away from me.
[14:23.08]Turn up the gamma.
[14:23.94]Yeah, I could turn the brightness up too.
[14:25.56]Sorry, I'm kind of getting thrown into this here, having to restart my stream like two fucking times.
[14:34.73]This is not going to go well.
[14:35.57]You're going to be fine.
[14:39.33]Hey, look, I'm fine.
[14:40.53]I'm almost dead, though.
[14:41.99]Don't worry, you got me later.
[14:42.92]There's a guy behind us.
[14:44.78]This is backup.
[14:45.46]There are reinforcements behind us now.
[14:47.48]I have a pistol and a bow.
[14:49.46]Oh my... Wait, why are they... I don't even know what I just did.
[14:54.14]This is on normal difficulty.
[14:57.51]Why did we do this?
[14:58.45]Are you dead again?
[14:59.55]Yes.
[15:00.47]Why did he explode?
[15:01.47]Why did that man explode?
[15:05.39]Jerma's OBS must have crashed because he muted himself in TeamSpeak.
[15:08.14]Am I seriously muted right now?
[15:10.34]I didn't do anything.
[15:11.20]I'm on a mission right now.
[15:13.76]Can you hear me now?
[15:14.98]Yeah.
[15:15.28]Okay, for some reason middle mouse button is mute myself.
[15:19.04]I don't know what the hell is going on.
[15:20.48]Oh, yeah, that would explain a lot.
[15:21.65]Dude, my computer makes no sense.
[15:24.85]I swear to God it's possessed.
[15:26.27]I have an actual possessed computer.
[15:27.89]Like, there's a fucking ghost in here.
[15:30.53]I did not do that.
[15:32.31]I did not change that.
[15:34.76]I took the liberty.
[15:39.06]I swear to God.
[15:39.72]Speaking of liberty, bringing some liberty to Montana.
[15:45.72]We did it.
[15:46.90]Give me one second so I can change this and get this fixed for no reason.
[15:50.83]Why middle mouse button is mute myself?
[15:54.05]Who the fuck would ever make that a command?
[15:56.45]I definitely didn't.
[15:57.25]Was I sleepwalking when I did this?
[16:01.17]What?
[16:01.49]Alright, hotkeys.
[16:04.67]Where is it?
[16:06.93]Here's why I know I didn't do this.
[16:08.46]I don't even know where the fuck you go in the settings to change this.
[16:11.90]That's how it's impossible.
[16:12.54]Are you looking in TeamSpeak?
[16:13.84]Yeah, how do I do this in TeamSpeak?
[16:15.42]I've never done this.
[16:17.16]Alright, hold on.
[16:18.00]Let me help.
[16:19.96]That's how you know I didn't do it.
[16:22.14]It is tools, then options, and everyone in chat is going to be making fun now.
[16:28.04]And you use TeamSpeak, the superior codec.
[16:30.46]Tools, options, and then what?
[16:33.12]Then you go to hotkeys.
[16:36.16]Okay, that's where I am.
[16:36.88]On the left-hand side.
[16:37.68]Yeah.
[16:39.16]What?
[16:40.00]Get rid of this.
[16:40.84]Delete.
[16:41.72]Delete.
[16:43.95]Remove.
[16:45.91]Delete it.
[16:48.59]Carumbo.
[16:50.15]Okay.
[16:51.15]Jesus Christ.
[16:52.43]Now let me do this.
[16:56.72]let me turn this up a little it's probably a little better uh you may have also gotten some perk points I got perk points we're gonna have to use them so it's it's in the menu with the Dragon Ball use Discord well the only reason why we don't use Discord is because the audio codec for team speak sounds better than the Discord one
[17:23.24]Not to mention we would have to have a separate channel just for us anyway.
[17:27.02]Well, I mean, we've got to get with the times eventually here.
[17:30.48]Discord is a lower quality.
[17:34.29]Alright, so this is one of our friends, right?
[17:38.89]I don't know.
[17:39.19]I'm looking at my...
[17:40.37]Yes, this is one of our friends.
[17:42.57]He's probably going to give us a mission.
[17:44.55]Let's do a mission.
[17:46.88]Instead of just wandering around aimlessly.
[17:50.94]But you kind of do wander around aimlessly.
[17:54.44]We have missions.
[17:55.28]Can't we do story missions?
[17:56.30]This is the Skyrim with guns game, remember?
[17:58.74]Yeah, but we can do the Skyrim with guns portion of the game in the middle.
[18:04.60]See?
[18:04.96]He just gave us the thing.
[18:08.65]You want to do a story mission where we have to listen to people do cutscenes?
[18:12.36]Is that what you want?
[18:13.80]By the way, only you can hire people.
[18:17.52]So you can't hire people?
[18:18.66]I cannot hire people.
[18:19.42]Let's see what we got for perks.
[18:20.26]Available two points.
[18:21.20]Parachute.
[18:21.69]That's kind of cool.
[18:23.09]What does this guy say when you go up to him?
[18:27.25]It says host only.
[18:29.09]Oh.
[18:31.50]I wouldn't buy... I'm not going to buy anything until I... I'd rather loot dead people.
[18:35.86]I mean, grapple hook kind of sounds... Oh, grapple... Now we're talking my language.
[18:39.96]Where's grapple hook?
[18:40.72]Yeah, it's in the perks.
[18:41.62]I'm getting it.
[18:42.16]I'm going to get grapple hook and parachute.
[18:43.32]I thought you were standing at the shop.
[18:44.94]I thought you were, like, paying for things.
[18:46.80]I got grapple hook and I got parachute.
[18:48.65]You should think about joining the resistance.
[18:51.89]I'm going to make sure we get us a vehicle.
[18:58.23]This looks like a pretty good vehicle for me.
[18:59.63]This is pretty standard to me.
[19:10.55]Radio off.
[19:12.83]There's a handbrake on this thing?
[19:14.03]Why would there be a handbrake on a tractor?
[19:19.57]Alright, I can throw cans.
[19:23.85]I didn't just throw a can.
[19:24.55]I just punched my... I just cut my whole arm open.
[19:27.79]Oh, I see you're in a tractor now.
[19:29.03]Yep.
[19:31.19]Oh.
[19:33.93]Alright, you ready?
[19:35.53]Uh, I will be in a second.
[19:40.89]Can you not get in this?
[19:41.53]I'm ready.
[19:43.73]You're going to fall off that, aren't you?
[19:45.39]No.
[19:45.81]What if I'm very gentle?
[19:47.33]This is a triple-A video game.
[19:49.23]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[19:49.81]You can't fall off in triple-A video games.
[19:52.25]Let me turn around.
[19:53.01]Alright, we're going to go that way.
[19:59.81]What?
[20:00.53]Uh, what?
[20:01.07]There's a bear?
[20:04.15]Yeah, there is a bear.
[20:05.03]It's dead.
[20:06.08]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[20:07.66]There's another bear.
[20:10.36]He seems to be possessed by some kind of fairy dust.
[20:12.76]Yeah, so this lady has, like, fairy dust possession ability.
[20:15.85]Alright, we'll get him.
[20:22.47]I don't even know where he went.
[20:23.61]He just vanished.
[20:24.99]Alright, well, let's just go to the mission.
[20:26.11]We'll deal with him later.
[20:28.07]Ow.
[20:30.60]Did I wedges between two trees?
[20:33.18]Staying on top of this is working surprisingly well.
[20:36.90]We have to kill the bears.
[20:38.32]Yeah, we have to kill the bear.
[20:39.52]He's got to be in the bear cave.
[20:40.69]What about the bear cave?
[20:41.55]This looks good.
[20:44.45]I might have a problem here in a second.
[20:46.81]I think I'm too tall for the clearance.
[20:49.15]Yeah, we can't get in there.
[20:50.13]We're going to have to just go search.
[20:54.61]Are you really that scared of the bear?
[20:56.72]Listen, he jump scared me around the corner.
[21:02.61]Okay, he takes a lot of hits.
[21:05.23]I need to chill for a second.
[21:07.19]Do I only have cans?
[21:09.47]Okay, I'm throwing cans.
[21:12.71]No, those are definitely dynamite.
[21:15.12]Hold on a minute.
[21:16.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:16.56]Why did I just throw... I just threw a can, and then I threw a can at the bear's face, and then I threw a grenade.
[21:22.16]I don't know why I have a grenade now.
[21:29.13]The first thing I thought was a can.
[21:30.11]How do you get cans?
[21:31.47]I think you might have to just pick them up.
[21:32.51]Alright, there's another bear over there.
[21:34.57]Why do I have this?
[21:39.17]I think you're definitely throwing dynamite.
[21:41.69]Where did he just go?
[21:46.01]Did you launch somebody into the space?
[21:48.43]I just sound like he fucking ran away really fast and smashed into something.
[21:53.32]Alright, let's go.
[21:54.35]Alright, do you want to do a main story thing?
[21:56.37]I mean, we only have to kill one more bear.
[21:57.73]We might as well do it.
[21:58.93]Oh, is that what it is?
[22:00.47]Where'd you go?
[22:01.77]I thought you... You're not on this?
[22:03.47]No, I opened my map to find out.
[22:04.75]Oh, no.
[22:05.09]Right here.
[22:09.21]Now, can is just T. But what if I throw the first thing?
[22:11.95]Only while you're on a vehicle, right?
[22:13.29]Right.
[22:13.41]Or is it just... No.
[22:14.49]Is it just in general?
[22:15.43]Is it any time?
[22:16.73]It might be.
[22:18.25]I think that's how you, like, distract guards and make them walk away so you can play stealthy.
[22:22.54]Alright, we need a bear.
[22:24.67]I heard it was possible to play through the whole game without firing a shot.
[22:28.51]That's kind of cool.
[22:29.03]I don't know if that's true.
[22:30.70]Alright, we're looking for... I'm just mowing the lawn.
[22:36.46]That's all I'm doing right now.
[22:39.90]Bear?
[22:40.14]Nope.
[22:43.30]No bear.
[22:43.60]I mean, they're alright around this.
[22:47.88]Yeah, they're in this area.
[22:48.60]It's 160 meters that way, though.
[22:50.02]To your right.
[22:55.16]left other right here you see the big yellow one oh god yeah that's what I'm looking at there was some lag there may have been some lag they're over here what what's wrong remember the lag related things that happened in park yeah alright happening again but worse there's another bear in here somewhere you're driving sideways
[23:20.10]Any more bears that you can see in the bear cave?
[23:22.52]This lady may know.
[23:23.42]I don't know.
[23:23.82]She's got like an exclamation over her head.
[23:26.10]How about up here?
[23:31.45]Maybe we shouldn't be driving around in this.
[23:32.75]We're probably going to scare him away.
[23:36.67]Does that make sense?
[23:37.59]That's a good point.
[23:40.81]Alright.
[23:41.33]I'll get off.
[23:41.71]Yeah, you get off.
[23:42.45]I'm going to turn the FOV up.
[23:44.43]It's kind of making me want to throw up.
[23:46.48]What are you on?
[23:46.94]95.
[23:47.48]95?
[23:47.68]I'm on like 90 and it seems okay.
[23:51.08]I don't know why it's giving me problems.
[23:52.86]I'm going to go to 100.
[23:55.35]Playing Quake now.
[23:56.75]There we go.
[23:57.33]That's what we're talking about.
[23:58.41]Oh, here he is.
[23:58.97]I found him.
[23:59.31]You found him?
[24:00.11]I'm coming.
[24:03.11]Now this looks a little odd.
[24:07.80]I keep just crashing.
[24:08.90]Did you get him?
[24:29.22]Yeah, that worked out pretty good, I think.
[24:32.44]You got a little stuck.
[24:33.56]You got a little bear on your tire, but... Besides that... Okay, we got him.
[24:38.97]We got the bear.
[24:39.57]I didn't have to use any ammo, so... You can get on the back.
[24:42.07]It'll be fine.
[24:43.41]You may want to get the bear skin, because that's how you get money.
[24:46.03]Do we need the bear skin?
[24:46.97]Yeah.
[24:48.53]Let me just drive over him again.
[24:49.85]Okay, he's just tenderizing the meat.
[24:52.13]Okay, somebody's going to appreciate that.
[24:53.76]Damaged skin.
[24:54.58]Now he's damaged.
[25:00.47]Oh, he's damaged because you rolled over him so it wasn't good quality?
[25:04.91]It's like, you know when something funny hits you?
[25:07.45]Like, way after the fact?
[25:09.97]Yeah.
[25:10.81]It's hitting me right now.
[25:11.81]Like, that's a delayed... You know when you eat a hot pepper and it's a delayed pepper and you eat a habanero?
[25:16.37]Yeah, it's in the back of your throat now, but it just wasn't there before.
[25:19.41]Yeah, I just got a habanero joke right there.
[25:21.61]It's slowly coming to me.
[25:24.75]That's fucking some hot pepper comedy.
[25:29.66]Alright, so we get, um, is this lady going to give us a reward?
[25:34.10]Uh... She may just have another side quest to do.
[25:37.97]Really?
[25:38.25]Nah, she can hire.
[25:39.85]Okay.
[25:39.95]Hot pepper gamer.
[25:40.69]Hmm.
[25:40.81]Willis Huntley.
[25:53.78]Alright, you drive.
[25:55.88]I cannot be trusted.
[25:56.76]Let's go talk to old Willis.
[25:58.92]Has my OBS crashed yet?
[26:00.36]No?
[26:00.58]We're good.
[26:01.08]Great.
[26:01.50]Good.
[26:02.06]Good.
[26:02.50]I'll know because you'll mute sporadically.
[26:08.80]Looking good.
[26:10.94]Is there like a stand I can do?
[26:17.40]That is a Mack truck.
[26:21.41]We're fine.
[26:26.18]a normal everyday sight.
[26:30.12]Watch out for the bunnies.
[26:31.60]They're fine.
[26:32.74]They're cute and cuddly and they're alive.
[26:35.08]Alright, so what do you do?
[26:36.38]Let's go up here.
[26:37.18]Bottle?
[26:37.62]Oh, he's been monitoring us.
[26:54.29]What are you thinking?
[26:55.19]Why would you do something like this?
[26:59.02]Bring him up.
[26:59.46]Bring him up.
[27:00.86]He's alright.
[27:01.74]He'll continue his conversation in a second.
[27:04.59]Oh my god.
[27:06.25]And we're back.
[27:14.17]what is I oh you did it this time hey that's just I did it first though I know like I like that it does he doesn't even get interrupted he doesn't even have to redo the dialog it picks up right oh my god bring him back let's see what he had to say whoa he's got a gun he's in conflict ready to serve your country and we're
[27:42.64]What is he treating it like?
[27:43.52]A fucking Food Network show?
[27:45.82]Thanks for watching that commercial break.
[27:48.60]Okay, so... Alright, it's a prayer to redact.
[28:00.51]Follow Willis to the Lincoln Lookout Tower.
[28:02.77]Can we get in his car?
[28:04.37]I think we can get in his car, yeah.
[28:06.08]Alright.
[28:08.94]Don't do it.
[28:09.72]I was testing him.
[28:10.36]I was just testing him.
[28:13.02]Alright, let's go.
[28:13.72]Drive.
[28:15.34]Is he drive?
[28:16.02]Why is he in the front seat?
[28:18.31]It wants us.
[28:18.83]Oh, there he goes.
[28:29.22]I knew it was coming.
[28:31.04]I just thought you were gonna do it sooner is all.
[28:32.98]I wasn't expecting it to be, like, delayed.
[28:38.67]He's still... Oh, this game's great.
[28:41.43]What a great... Oh, we're both in the backseat now.
[28:45.07]This is like under duress.
[28:49.37]He is driving right now.
[28:51.28]We both have a gun pointed at the back of his head.
[28:55.26]Drive!
[28:57.08]You better get to the bank quick!
[28:58.62]He needs to be going real fast.
[29:00.04]Off a cliff.
[29:00.42]He's so scared to drive.
[29:01.38]He knows he doesn't want to die again.
[29:02.86]This is it?
[29:03.54]Are you serious?
[29:04.06]Why are you running?
[29:05.26]Why wouldn't you just keep driving?
[29:06.08]Why would you do this?
[29:21.78]This is just his nightly exercise routine, man.
[29:24.50]Honest to God, why would you do that?
[29:30.36]The car is back there and... This is unbelievable.
[29:37.39]This is un-fucking-believable.
[29:40.49]I have no words.
[29:41.27]I have nothing to say about this.
[29:44.95]Follow Willis to the Lincoln Lookout Tower.
[29:50.00]How far away is that?
[29:52.08]Is that a drive?
[29:52.76]Uh-oh.
[29:53.86]Uh-oh.
[29:54.74]Follow me.
[29:56.22]Does that look like a tower?
[29:57.06]I'm not allowed to drive this car for some reason.
[29:59.15]Oh, you can't?
[30:00.45]No.
[30:00.65]Apparently, we're at the tower.
[30:02.73]Falls End is pretty bad, but it's still better than Pittsburgh.
[30:06.41]Did he stop running?
[30:08.19]I was getting the, you're getting too far away from the objective warning.
[30:12.57]Do you see the random guy in multiplayer GTA that has the helicopter for no reason?
[30:17.15]There, he's down there.
[30:19.33]He's where?
[30:20.09]There's just a GTA multiplayer, hey look, I'm a guy in a helicopter for no reason is down there.
[30:26.22]Okay.
[30:30.64]Is this the secret route?
[30:32.78]I don't know.
[30:35.40]What tower is he talking about?
[30:37.08]This one right here.
[30:38.50]Oh, okay.
[30:39.80]That's what he means.
[30:42.58]We should be tunnel slugs.
[30:43.73]What do you think?
[30:45.67]Yeah, I think I don't have enough ammo to go like
[30:49.94]I have 41 bullets.
[30:51.90]14, sorry.
[30:53.56]Alright, I'll take point.
[30:56.70]You take that way, because you get the stealth weapon.
[30:58.86]I'm going to go in straight ahead.
[31:01.03]Throw a couple of rocks.
[31:06.35]I got him to come this way.
[31:07.11]I'm going to see if I can get him.
[31:07.87]I'm going to climb up the rocks and pull him down.
[31:11.27]Just like in Hitman 2.
[31:16.02]Got one kill.
[31:16.66]You got one.
[31:17.06]I'm going to get this guy right here.
[31:18.36]I have a loud weapon, though.
[31:21.60]Alright, watch it, watch it.
[31:22.50]Don't show yourself.
[31:26.74]Load them.
[31:28.24]Okay, we got rifle ammo.
[31:30.92]How you doing over there?
[31:33.38]Taking out some snipers?
[31:34.51]Yeah, I'm gonna wrap around.
[31:40.69]Anybody left in that tower?
[31:41.49]Uh, there's definitely still some people here.
[31:48.14]Not anymore.
[31:51.64]That was cool.
[31:52.70]Alright, meet him in the tower.
[31:54.84]Take the loot.
[31:57.16]That was some real co-op action right there.
[31:58.90]That was pretty cooperative right there, I'll tell you.
[32:00.36]There's like a bunch of stuff in here.
[32:01.44]You might want to get it.
[32:05.44]Ugh.
[32:07.00]Alright, well that... Meet me in the tower.
[32:09.10]He's going to take a long time, isn't he?
[32:14.61]Uh, he's here.
[32:15.13]Alright.
[32:16.67]Yeah, I got a sniper rifle now.
[32:18.33]This is cool.
[32:20.33]How much ammo does this have?
[32:24.80]Why do they have to make the little SMG take the same slot as the phone?
[32:28.95]Yeah, we're good.
[32:31.27]Are you killing him?
[32:33.77]No, I'm just shooting this new gun.
[32:35.49]I want to see what it... Sounds fun.
[32:39.69]It feels fun.
[32:43.93]So there's a lot of random stuff going on here, huh?
[32:46.49]What do you mean?
[32:48.60]I feel like... I feel like we haven't done anything, but we've done a lot.
[32:52.13]Okay, well, okay.
[32:53.25]So the reason why you do this stuff... Remember, like, the little tutorial chat desk?
[32:58.65]Hey, by the way, I think he's luring somebody up here.
[33:02.87]Wait for Willis to lure VIP.
[33:05.47]You know how in Just Cause you have to do enough damage to an area to, like, take control of it?
[33:12.17]That's what we're doing.
[33:12.93]Hey, make sure you grab this random thing in here.
[33:17.34]Take the pepper.
[33:18.96]Take that hot pepper.
[33:19.74]Tail the helicopter.
[33:21.20]Oh.
[33:22.60]How?
[33:24.22]I don't know.
[33:27.68]That is the helicopter.
[33:29.73]What?
[33:30.15]What in the name of... The chopper's getting away.
[33:37.13]You alright?
[33:37.49]Come here.
[33:39.49]I broke both my legs.
[33:40.89]There was a zip line.
[33:42.21]Wasn't there?
[33:42.71]Shit.
[33:42.95]It's alright.
[33:43.25]The chopper's getting away.
[33:43.87]Get on.
[33:44.89]Get on.
[33:49.98]The chopper is getting away.
[33:52.94]Hey, see that chopper going 500 miles per hour by you?
[33:55.60]Please follow that.
[34:00.34]Tried to no-scope him.
[34:01.56]It didn't work.
[34:02.22]You're good.
[34:03.68]What's wrong?
[34:06.22]What is going on with you?
[34:07.06]What's happening?
[34:07.54]I hit a bump.
[34:10.12]No, you just got angry and the tree blew up.
[34:14.12]There's a big forest I'm going through right now.
[34:18.82]Oh!
[34:20.48]We're still fine, we're fine.
[34:21.42]Alright, I may have just hit my head on the tree.
[34:25.76]It's alright, 85 meters.
[34:26.66]We're almost there.
[34:28.78]You're doing great.
[34:31.10]Can't give me words of encouragement.
[34:32.86]See, you're doing good.
[34:34.02]Let him get... Let him get in the chopper.
[34:39.48]Don't kill this guy.
[34:40.86]Etalyx, Etalyx!
[34:41.32]Etalyx, we need to wait until the guy gets in the chopper.
[34:46.55]Should I snipe this guy?
[34:49.29]Oh, no.
[34:53.03]I thought it was the guy in the chopper.
[34:54.47]Is it not?
[34:57.39]I don't think we kill him though, right?
[34:58.73]We just... Um... What?
[35:03.86]Oh, I'm in the helicopter.
[35:06.04]You're in the helicopter.
[35:09.68]Okay.
[35:11.34]Did we get a you failed the whole game?
[35:22.08]Wait, I see we're good.
[35:23.80]Yeah, we weren't supposed to do anything about that.
[35:31.28]You went up there and startled them.
[35:32.55]Look, I'm sorry, okay?
[35:34.59]I was just under duress.
[35:35.71]Alright, here he goes.
[35:36.69]We need a car.
[35:37.91]Now.
[35:39.43]Like, right now.
[35:42.71]Is there anything still up there?
[35:46.29]Oh.
[35:47.49]Well.
[35:49.06]Truck.
[35:51.40]I got one.
[35:51.88]Get in.
[35:55.98]You in?
[35:57.82]I'm on my way.
[35:59.20]On my way.
[36:00.00]Get in.
[36:01.40]Okay.
[36:01.86]Go.
[36:02.54]Oh, shit.
[36:08.66]Maybe we should just stay on the... Do we not get a vehicle at the start?
[36:12.68]Like right here?
[36:15.36]We just need to go up and get the truck.
[36:22.61]Okay, so get up here, get in the car.
[36:26.48]I'm going to put a tracer on this chopper.
[36:30.10]Ken, do you actually have that?
[36:34.34]He's in the chopper.
[36:35.18]Alright, let's get in there now and get in the car.
[36:37.60]No dilly-dallying, no slacking around.
[36:40.35]What the?
[36:40.79]Who exploded?
[36:42.81]Did you blow up?
[36:45.67]What did you do?
[36:47.94]I'm sorry.
[36:48.74]What did you just do?
[36:51.80]I tried to launch TNT and have it explode in the air at the chopper.
[36:55.76]I didn't know how far I could throw it.
[37:01.32]I thought your character exploded.
[37:03.20]Alright, there they go.
[37:04.16]Get in the truck.
[37:18.69]And tail.
[37:21.31]There they go.
[37:21.81]You in?
[37:22.35]Good.
[37:22.73]I'm in!
[37:24.78]You got this, I believe in you.
[37:26.02]Alright, do we- can we not have, like, the- I'm gonna get those, like, hints off the screen.
[37:30.90]Uh, they disappear by themselves, I think.
[37:33.58]But also, you can configure the whole UI in the options, I believe.
[37:38.09]So you can play Far Cry as nature intended it.
[37:43.73]By crashing into trees and rocks and stumps.
[37:46.84]I think we failed again.
[37:53.54]No, not yet.
[37:54.37]We haven't failed yet.
[37:55.25]We need to get to the road.
[37:56.39]There's a road just to the right.
[37:59.81]Oh, God.
[38:00.73]Okay, I'm going to get there.
[38:02.05]We'll get there.
[38:02.64]Don't worry.
[38:06.89]By the way, there's no controller excuse this time.
[38:09.31]This is PC.
[38:10.35]Oh, no.
[38:10.75]The only excuse I can use here is... Oh, there's water.
[38:13.27]There's water.
[38:17.48]Fucking God.
[38:18.26]You drive for fuck's sake.
[38:23.68]Bumping the difficulty up to hard.
[38:31.66]I love this game so far.
[38:33.22]This is fucking, this is fun.
[38:35.46]They just start you out at like a hundred miles an hour, like, just dope.
[38:40.51]I wish we could get a car now.
[38:42.99]But we auto drive.
[38:44.01]I mean, we had an ATV.
[38:47.60]Yeah, it really goes like zero to a hundred.
[38:52.08]It's fucking funny.
[38:54.42]Alright, let's go.
[38:57.64]You take care of it.
[39:02.59]Like, is it worth going off-road?
[39:04.44]I don't know.
[39:05.78]Maybe not.
[39:06.42]Maybe it is.
[39:06.94]There's a jump right there.
[39:09.84]You have to hit it.
[39:13.36]Whoa!
[39:15.22]This is definitely the route you're supposed to go.
[39:17.31]Yeah, yeah.
[39:18.05]This is definitely the route.
[39:21.75]Look, there's jumps and shit.
[39:24.59]How is it still getting away, though?
[39:25.97]Thought we almost didn't make it.
[39:34.61]Big stunt.
[39:35.25]I mean, he's right here.
[39:39.47]There's people behind us.
[39:41.17]There's bad guys behind us.
[39:42.28]There's bad guys to the left of me.
[39:45.54]Uh, bad guys to the right of me.
[39:47.80]Every vehicle in this game is a Tesla.
[39:50.50]Pretty much.
[39:50.94]Dammit.
[39:54.32]Think so you can like lean out and shoot without crashing off the side of the road.
[39:57.90]Now's the time for the stick.
[39:58.68]When he lands, clear the area.
[40:03.17]Remember, an old VHA step when he lands.
[40:05.60]Secure the safe house.
[40:06.34]Alright, let's play this correctly because there's a lot of bad guys here.
[40:13.64]That's so cool.
[40:14.62]I got a sniper.
[40:15.22]Come here.
[40:16.58]What do you got over here?
[40:17.72]My door wouldn't open.
[40:18.94]Do the animation.
[40:19.92]Just go in the front door.
[40:22.20]Now, like, move up just an inch.
[40:24.82]And then get out.
[40:27.43]You go out the other way.
[40:29.43]You guy was occupying the passenger seat, so I actually did an animation to get in the back seat and then get out.
[40:34.76]I don't know.
[40:36.64]I got a sniper here.
[40:37.62]I could probably get a collateral on these two guys.
[40:39.76]See if I can get it.
[40:40.68]We got to tag some people first.
[40:42.72]That works.
[40:46.14]I'll just be here.
[40:46.68]Don't worry.
[40:49.74]I'll take care of that.
[40:50.82]They don't even know where it's coming from.
[40:53.78]What was that?
[40:54.22]What did you just do to me?
[41:00.35]What did you just do to me?
[41:01.57]Me?
[41:01.87]I haven't done anything.
[41:02.83]I'm, like, on my own.
[41:04.25]I'm chillin' over here.
[41:05.01]I think they're all dead.
[41:05.64]There's only one more in there.
[41:09.46]Did I kill the VIP?
[41:10.54]I guess I did.
[41:11.08]Yeah, we just need to secure the building.
[41:14.24]Find the VHS tape in the bunker.
[41:17.74]Is he not?
[41:21.66]Bunker.
[41:22.26]Hmm.
[41:23.46]This looks promising.
[41:25.60]Let me get, actually, I want to
[41:27.82]No, I like the scope.
[41:28.94]I want that again.
[41:30.42]Find the bunker.
[41:35.62]Found it.
[41:36.02]Is there already a dead guy in here?
[41:42.20]There is, yeah.
[41:43.14]They locked him in.
[41:44.22]Does he have anything on him?
[41:46.84]No, but they've got chests over here.
[41:50.48]Blasting cap.
[41:52.75]Bring the VHS tape.
[41:54.27]Nice.
[41:56.39]Perk point.
[41:57.82]Oh, you got a perk point?
[41:59.48]I got a perk point.
[42:00.18]I think I have two.
[42:00.70]I need to put it in.
[42:01.44]Nice.
[42:01.64]I have five.
[42:07.88]Why do I have five?
[42:09.28]Dynamite.
[42:09.68]I'm going to put grenades on.
[42:10.52]Alright, let's go.
[42:16.07]Move much faster while crouched.
[42:19.87]Car?
[42:20.19]Boat?
[42:20.43]What is that?
[42:21.23]What noise is that making?
[42:24.51]Alright, two perk points.
[42:27.59]These cost four.
[42:27.91]Oh, that was very expensive.
[42:29.27]Whoops.
[42:30.91]Close combat gear.
[42:31.71]Carry more handgun ammo and melee weapons.
[42:35.91]I mean, might as well just take... I mean, is it important to hold on to points?
[42:39.29]Or is it just kind of take anything you want?
[42:42.02]Swim faster, hold your breath longer.
[42:43.30]I mean, in theory, eventually you should probably have all of these, I would think.
[42:48.68]It doesn't seem like a tree necessarily.
[42:50.98]Yeah.
[42:51.82]But it does get more expensive the further you go down the tree, so.
[42:55.12]Well, let's do the extra handgun ammo and more melee weapons.
[42:58.61]Or, maybe not.
[42:59.67]I'm going to hold on to him for now.
[43:01.67]I'm not going to use him yet.
[43:05.45]I don't think there's a need for it right now.
[43:09.09]Alright, there he is.
[43:09.59]Sir, I'm happy to report I got the tape.
[43:11.37]What's that?
[43:16.50]Are you kidding me, sir?
[43:17.36]Are you kidding me?
[43:18.34]Chief of Staff.
[43:19.98]I'd be honored.
[43:20.92]I'll be there in time.
[43:23.08]We're on the same side!
[43:24.76]We're on the same side.
[43:28.51]I've got bigger fish to fry, and this little bearded uprising is suddenly below my pay grade.
[43:33.27]The American way used to be.
[43:35.85]Don't make me shoot you!
[43:38.05]I hope he shoots you.
[43:38.89]Stop it!
[43:44.40]Stop it!
[43:46.13]Leave him alone.
[43:46.67]He's just trying to tell us things.
[43:51.09]Stop it!
[43:52.67]There's no reason for this.
[43:54.24]I hope he shoots you.
[43:54.78]Shoot him.
[43:55.36]He deserves it.
[43:56.08]Every bit of it.
[43:58.20]Do it.
[43:59.34]Shoot him.
[44:02.80]I think he... Alright, I think he doesn't need to get in.
[44:21.56]Did you break the encounter?
[44:25.24]You broke the encounter, didn't you?
[44:30.92]Fix him!
[44:34.54]Fix him, please!
[44:35.30]There we go.
[44:41.43]Got it.
[44:41.57]Fix it.
[44:42.01]See, now he's actually holding the gun at him.
[44:43.75]Like he should be.
[44:44.31]Am I muted?
[44:44.63]I better not be.
[44:45.13]I think he is.
[44:45.47]Yeah, you were muted.
[44:46.83]See, now it's affecting you.
[45:08.07]I didn't push a mute button.
[45:09.87]I'm telling you, you're getting infected by the fucking ghost computer.
[45:12.89]I got infected by the mute.
[45:16.19]Alright, so that's good.
[45:17.29]2,000 bucks.
[45:20.24]Anything else?
[45:22.58]It's funny.
[45:23.86]What's going on back there?
[45:25.04]I don't know.
[45:27.72]Hold on.
[45:28.28]He's got like a little circle above his head.
[45:31.30]Beautiful shot.
[45:32.23]I'll tell you that right now.
[45:34.23]Double it.
[45:35.01]Double it up.
[45:36.51]I'll take two, please.
[45:39.18]um wait what is are these bad guys what are they doing here is that a alright easy watch out for him I I think we're just done with him no I think he's got like a circle above his head I think we're done that's gotta mean something does it
[46:05.39]That person is trying to talk to you.
[46:06.47]Uh-oh.
[46:07.25]Uh-oh, Jerma.
[46:08.13]I'm sorry to tell you, but there are attack dogs in this game.
[46:10.85]Attack dogs.
[46:12.18]Yes, I see that.
[46:12.60]There are attack dogs, and if I get... If my life is threatened... Just stand in the way between you and him.
[46:18.54]...by that dog, then I will kill the attack dog.
[46:21.80]I'm sorry.
[46:22.52]He's coming this way.
[46:24.58]Shoot the animal in the face!
[46:26.10]He's running.
[46:27.27]What happened here?
[46:28.87]Oh, that's the explosion.
[46:30.85]Shoot the animal in the face.
[46:32.29]Alright, he's trying to get away.
[46:33.03]Get in his car, quick.
[46:33.47]Shoot the animal in the face!
[46:35.44]I commandeered in an accident.
[46:36.74]He got out because I hit E on him.
[46:39.18]There's too much.
[46:39.92]I can't talk to the NPC because he's constantly in danger.
[46:41.78]I know.
[46:42.02]There's too many things going on.
[46:44.82]There's a helicopter right here.
[46:45.80]I'm getting it.
[46:47.78]There's a dog that says otherwise.
[46:49.82]Yeah.
[46:50.06]Well, he can deal with it.
[46:50.90]He can get in if he wants.
[46:51.74]Alright.
[46:52.86]So do I now... Can I park this in my garage and I get to keep this like GTA?
[47:00.85]Oh, Lord.
[47:01.41]Driving around like this.
[47:02.13]Where is he going?
[47:04.63]Where is he?
[47:05.57]I'll follow you with the helicopter.
[47:07.11]I'm in the passenger seat.
[47:08.81]Oh, I'll follow.
[47:09.47]Okay, I'll be like the news anchor that follows you guys around.
[47:12.07]Like, he has complete control right now.
[47:15.75]Okay, so where is he taking you?
[47:17.95]You couldn't do this in four, right?
[47:19.69]I don't think so.
[47:20.13]You couldn't just get in with an NPC.
[47:23.23]Yeah, I don't think that was possible before.
[47:25.32]Unless I'm crazy.
[47:26.02]You are right behind us, yeah.
[47:27.44]I'm just following you guys around.
[47:30.08]It's actually not that hard to fly a helicopter in this one.
[47:34.99]Those people don't like you.
[47:38.89]I feel like he's just gonna drive you around in a circle.
[47:42.56]Nope.
[47:43.42]He's trying to shoot something.
[47:45.28]He's trying to turn around.
[47:47.06]He's like sticking his gun out the window.
[47:49.56]Where the fuck are you going?
[47:51.80]Why did you guys do that?
[47:53.47]I don't know.
[47:55.05]I'm just letting him make the shot calls right now.
[47:58.57]He's got a mind of his own.
[48:03.07]Okay, how high can I go?
[48:04.67]He wants to fight these guys.
[48:06.59]I'm gonna come down and help.
[48:11.24]Alright, I have an idea.
[48:13.08]Just keep them occupied.
[48:15.02]Was that you?
[48:16.02]No, he's dead.
[48:16.72]I have no idea how he died.
[48:25.14]Where'd it go?
[48:26.58]Where's the helicopter?
[48:29.64]Where's the helicopter?
[48:35.27]I tried to drop it down on here.
[48:37.77]Where did the helicopter go?
[48:40.21]Oh, shit.
[48:45.02]I don't really know how, but he flew out of the vehicle and died by himself.
[48:50.62]I tried to drop a gigantic helicopter grenade on you guys, and I don't even know where it went.
[48:54.54]Wait, let me get in here.
[48:56.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:57.04]I'm not driving.
[48:57.74]Oh, goddammit.
[48:58.64]Just slow down.
[49:03.15]Slow down and let me in.
[49:04.19]He like ran into a water barrel.
[49:08.77]He is so preoccupied with somebody right now.
[49:12.51]He just wants to shoot that person so bad.
[49:15.15]I think he is just punting someone because he's like looking over towards them.
[49:21.00]He's like constantly checking his sticks.
[49:23.12]He's constantly going over there.
[49:27.77]What is he taking us?
[49:29.37]I don't know.
[49:30.61]Just a launch for the ride at this point.
[49:33.45]If we do one story mission today, I'll be impressed.
[49:35.95]I would also be impressed if we did one mission.
[49:38.73]This is too much fun just letting idiot AI do whatever they want.
[49:42.05]Alright, he peeled out.
[49:48.93]I'm honestly impressed by his tree navigation so far.
[49:51.71]I know!
[49:51.97]How is he this good at driving the car?
[49:56.34]I can stand back here.
[49:57.30]Okay, that's cool.
[50:01.28]Now we're back on the road.
[50:02.34]Alright.
[50:04.04]Looking good.
[50:04.52]Let's see where we're going on the map.
[50:07.37]Where are we?
[50:08.85]We were like a dead end a minute ago.
[50:11.05]We went all the way down to the southern most tip.
[50:12.83]God damn it.
[50:13.97]Fuck.
[50:14.47]What?
[50:14.71]I was trying to... Bye.
[50:18.24]See you later.
[50:18.68]It was nice to know you.
[50:21.46]They'll probably get into a fight up here or something.
[50:23.48]Slow down.
[50:24.42]I was trying to put a grenade in the trunk and then get out.
[50:30.38]Oh, don't worry.
[50:30.78]There's a Jeep over here.
[50:32.06]Well, there's a truck over here.
[50:32.74]I can get you guys.
[50:34.97]I'll catch up to you.
[50:39.73]Stick a remote bomb to the car.
[50:41.69]How are you back here at the water keg?
[50:44.61]That scared the shit out of me.
[50:47.69]He's like going the same way he was a second ago.
[50:52.18]Alright, I got people on me, but I'm coming.
[50:59.09]Yeah, weren't you guys just over here?
[51:00.89]We were just over here.
[51:02.73]He's a little more confused now than he was last time, though.
[51:06.73]How did I manage to get stuck here?
[51:08.81]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[51:10.87]No.
[51:11.47]God damn it.
[51:13.53]How did this happen?
[51:14.81]See you later.
[51:15.67]It's not even fucking possible.
[51:17.35]Wait.
[51:18.23]No, coming back.
[51:19.88]He thought about leaving you behind.
[51:22.34]Okay, now I can get in the car.
[51:24.04]I can get in the car.
[51:24.58]No shit!
[51:25.26]He's gunning it.
[51:26.10]He's like going fast.
[51:27.80]Alright, good.
[51:28.46]I'll get there.
[51:31.04]Come on, come on, come on!
[51:32.18]Alright, I'm in.
[51:40.03]Why is this more interesting than anything else?
[51:43.70]This is so interesting.
[51:44.82]Because it's just reasoning.
[51:46.26]They're just like trying to do something and we don't know what it is.
[51:54.31]I think he's just programmed to drive around in a circle until something happens.
[51:57.63]But he's like in the mountains.
[51:59.03]We're like way out here.
[52:00.21]Well, I think we found his spot he wanted to get out in.
[52:11.09]I want to talk.
[52:11.71]I just want to let me end his dialog first before you kill him.
[52:15.62]I want to see if he gives another thing.
[52:17.86]Did you just say third Armageddon?
[52:21.06]I think so.
[52:21.54]I'm done with this guy.
[52:23.02]Okay, he's done.
[52:23.72]Yeah, that's it.
[52:24.18]He's done.
[52:24.52]Alright, get in.
[52:25.40]What is he doing?
[52:40.85]He's accepting his fate, I think.
[52:42.70]Don't aim the gun at us.
[52:46.52]Can he get in?
[52:49.36]I don't think you can hire them.
[52:51.02]Or not this one.
[52:59.30]Alright, we might actually need him later.
[53:01.73]Alright, let's go.
[53:08.52]Let's go to the next mission.
[53:10.06]Don't, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:12.02]It was just a can.
[53:13.00]Okay, it was just a can, I was gonna say.
[53:14.46]Okay!
[53:19.80]This is more fun than anything I've ever done in my life!
[53:22.01]In my life.
[53:24.97]Oh god.
[53:41.72]Did you just get Looney Tunesed right there?
[53:43.42]Did you think that was gonna knock up your cliff?
[53:46.23]Yeah, you got Looney Tunesed.
[53:47.41]I get you.
[53:47.79]Alright, uh, let's keep going.
[53:52.23]Uh-huh.
[53:53.89]Let's do another mission here.
[53:57.21]Yeah.
[53:58.69]Be happy to.
[53:59.90]Oh, this is... Partner detected.
[54:05.24]I just got ran over.
[54:08.58]I'm gonna get run over too, I think.
[54:10.38]No, I'm not.
[54:11.45]They just make a beeline for you.
[54:20.94]Okay, well, I have a car.
[54:23.06]Alright, let's do something.
[54:25.88]Let's do something.
[54:27.38]Alright, let's pick.
[54:30.16]Which character do you want to rescue as a companion first?
[54:32.85]Let's do that.
[54:34.35]Who do you want to rescue?
[54:36.13]Your options are the bear.
[54:38.48]The cougar.
[54:39.76]The dog.
[54:40.86]The other dog.
[54:41.62]Is there two dogs?
[54:42.82]There's the guy that has airplanes.
[54:44.82]Guy that has airplanes.
[54:46.14]Okay.
[54:46.40]He's actually not far.
[54:48.08]Alright, let's go.
[54:50.44]Oh, look!
[54:50.96]We even get... We get a little thing on our map.
[54:54.93]Like the GPS?
[54:56.23]Yeah.
[54:57.09]That's kind of cool.
[55:02.33]Oh, that sounded like I broke a bone.
[55:07.23]You can hit shift.
[55:08.81]And auto drive.
[55:11.31]Traveling to waypoint.
[55:12.79]Oh, I see.
[55:13.50]It'll follow the road to the waypoint.
[55:15.06]Oh, that's so much fun.
[55:15.66]I can just do whatever.
[55:16.24]I can just throw cans at people and it'll drive for me?
[55:18.70]Yep.
[55:19.24]Wow.
[55:23.14]They've thought of everything.
[55:25.62]It's a little slower, but like, it's safe, you know?
[55:28.67]Yeah, it's safe.
[55:30.75]And you have to hit shift again to turn auto drive off.
[55:33.27]Okay.
[55:33.85]This is kind of far away.
[55:39.49]Easy auto drive.
[55:40.81]This is a real test to see if Google cars are going to be worth using.
[55:44.49]Already got in one accident.
[55:45.97]Thanks, Google.
[55:51.71]Oh, look, I can actually aim out the window.
[55:57.04]What is that car with a jail on it?
[56:00.04]I'm going to die, though.
[56:00.98]Why are these people fighting?
[56:03.78]That guy's got a flamethrower.
[56:04.90]Get that flamethrower.
[56:05.74]The Google car's not going to keep driving, is it?
[56:11.35]What if it did though?
[56:23.83]Oh my god, that was so dumb.
[56:25.77]Do you have a flamethrower now?
[56:27.72]Hey!
[56:29.78]I do.
[56:30.56]Alright, let's go.
[56:33.58]Go in the same Google car.
[56:36.16]We're gonna get separated.
[56:41.11]I accidentally hit Google Drive.
[56:43.89]Well, Google has to pay for it, though.
[56:46.80]It's gonna be new Google Insurance.
[56:50.18]Uh, why is Google... Why is Google Car driving like a psycho right now?
[56:54.14]I'm the one driving.
[56:55.56]Oh, oh, I thought... That's why.
[56:57.28]I thought Google Car was having some trouble.
[57:00.59]What is it?
[57:01.03]Radio stations?
[57:03.75]I don't want any music.
[57:04.85]I'm a non-music-in-the-car kind of guy.
[57:06.31]What about you?
[57:06.69]Uh, I can't even hear it anyway, so...
[57:14.59]Alright, we're almost there.
[57:15.41]Getting close.
[57:19.50]Liberation.
[57:29.04]Gotta do it.
[57:33.68]What's wrong with my crosshair?
[57:36.54]Nice.
[57:37.36]Alright.
[57:38.02]Liberate.
[57:39.54]Liberated.
[57:39.98]Two perk points awarded for the Liberation.
[57:42.54]Huh?
[57:44.59]Did you throw something?
[57:45.41]I did not throw something.
[57:48.55]I just got some prickly lettuce.
[57:50.35]Can we bring a friend?
[57:50.99]Planes.
[57:51.13]Seed ranch, cult outpost.
[57:52.19]Are we gonna go with her?
[57:52.93]I don't know, I just... Alright, Diana Madison is now on our team.
[57:54.75]I just added her to the crew.
[57:55.65]You added her to our friends list.
[57:56.89]Will she get in the car?
[58:16.22]Get in.
[58:16.98]Pull up a little bit, because we're like really close to this other car.
[58:23.01]I think, hang on, hang on.
[58:23.91]Let me, uh... No, maybe she's not.
[58:25.65]No, she's getting in there.
[58:26.51]Whoa, okay.
[58:28.31]Oh, that's not safe.
[58:30.57]That's unsafe.
[58:31.21]She's there.
[58:32.43]She's just there, huh?
[58:33.57]Yeah, she's just there.
[58:34.41]Yeah, she's just kind of...
[58:39.81]I'm just kind of trying to see how much she can take.
[58:43.47]She can take quite a bit.
[58:45.31]Google, take the wheel, Google.
[58:46.91]No, there's no signal.
[58:47.79]Shit, we're in the middle of nowhere.
[58:48.83]Oh, that'd be so funny if she just dumped off.
[58:57.29]Okay, Google, take the wheel.
[59:01.57]Pretty much there.
[59:02.21]It's like 90 meters that way off the road.
[59:04.07]Yeah, it's already there.
[59:10.74]Okay, be careful, but let's get out here.
[59:16.56]Okay, so don't start a fight yet.
[59:18.48]No.
[59:19.18]Because I can tell her what to do.
[59:21.18]So, you know, let's just make her do everything.
[59:24.59]Okay.
[59:24.99]You know, make her do the whole mission.
[59:27.15]We'll just sit here and just Google car, Google human.
[59:31.47]The game just plays for you.
[59:33.05]Aren't we here?
[59:34.91]I thought so.
[59:35.67]I mean, this is where you marked on the map, right?
[59:37.45]Alright, hold on.
[59:40.06]I mean, you marked this area right here with a waypoint, right?
[59:42.70]Change the marker.
[59:43.78]Change that up.
[59:44.18]Alright.
[59:47.06]There's like a hanger, I guess, that we have to go... Uh-oh.
[59:50.54]Hang on.
[59:51.88]Crouch.
[59:55.06]What the fuck is that thing?
[59:58.24]Okay, that was a dire wolf, man.
[60:01.00]Did you see the animal before he jumped out at you?
[60:03.79]No, he just was in my screen.
[60:07.05]I knew he was there.
[60:08.46]I was trying to get one of you two to go into it.
[60:11.85]Alright.
[60:12.65]She's not following you anymore.
[60:14.37]That's because I told her where to go.
[60:15.25]What was that?
[60:19.25]What is happening right now?
[60:23.40]Did you tell her to... No, she's coming up behind us.
[60:26.84]Hey, go detonate some shit.
[60:30.16]Okay.
[60:32.22]I hear a fight.
[60:34.03]There is a big fight going on up here.
[60:36.45]So who are we rooting for?
[60:37.29]Who are we trying to save here?
[60:38.91]We're trying to save some guy that knows how to fly airplanes.
[60:42.61]Okay.
[60:42.77]And maybe he'll give us airplane stuff.
[60:44.89]So let's do this smart.
[60:46.12]Okay, get your binoculars.
[60:48.50]Yep.
[60:53.06]They are.
[60:53.52]These people here.
[60:56.18]I'll just crouch.
[60:58.55]She's right next to me.
[61:00.97]Alright, you got a guy for me to snipe?
[61:03.31]Don't... You're gonna alert him.
[61:04.78]We gotta tag some more people first.
[61:06.52]Alright.
[61:06.84]Get those binoculars out.
[61:07.70]Let's take a look.
[61:10.04]I only see the one guy and the one guy he's shooting at, though.
[61:12.74]Yeah, so let me take him out.
[61:15.76]I wanna let her take him out.
[61:16.96]Alright.
[61:17.16]Well, then let it... Yeah.
[61:18.62]Say, go get him.
[61:23.20]If you select him and hit go get him, what happens?
[61:25.88]Let's find out.
[61:26.47]I just did.
[61:29.13]There she goes.
[61:30.23]Oh, she is going over there.
[61:36.37]What's she doing?
[61:36.87]She's backpedaling.
[61:41.95]I think she had a clear shot there for a second.
[61:44.43]She had a clear shot.
[61:46.37]I don't know.
[61:46.73]I think she's trying to decide what angle she wants to shoot from.
[61:50.91]No, she's backpedaling again.
[61:54.36]Go get him.
[61:56.00]Go get him.
[61:56.54]What are you... Here she goes.
[62:02.84]She's going so fast.
[62:05.66]No, wait a minute.
[62:07.52]She's behind him.
[62:09.04]Yeah, she's clearly behind him.
[62:10.64]Just take him out.
[62:12.28]Come on, lady.
[62:13.92]She's never killed anyone before.
[62:15.50]There might not be bullets in the gun, dude.
[62:17.87]There's no bullets in that gun.
[62:20.03]Are you sure there's bullets in the gun?
[62:21.63]I have no clue, but I like to think she's never killed a man before and is just trying to work the nerve up.
[62:30.03]Hang on.
[62:32.82]I'm telling her to move right next to him.
[62:34.16]Move like right behind him.
[62:37.38]Okay, now she's hiding behind the tree.
[62:38.88]Here we go.
[62:41.39]Moment of truth.
[62:47.81]Shoot him.
[62:48.71]What the fuck?
[62:50.05]He's like jazz dancing off stage left.
[62:54.19]She's just following him around.
[62:55.85]Yeah, she just follows him around now.
[62:57.95]I don't know why she won't do the kill.
[62:59.31]This is not worth my money to hire this person.
[63:01.41]Alright, put, put, make it so he sees her.
[63:04.26]Maybe somebody, maybe he has to... I mean, I don't, I think it... Does she have... I feel like it's one of those situations where she physically can't be seen until you start fighting.
[63:12.60]Alright, well, so you're up there, he sees you.
[63:15.69]He doesn't see me yet.
[63:16.45]I'm hiding behind a tree.
[63:17.21]No.
[63:19.48]Okay.
[63:19.62]Let me just let him see me.
[63:20.84]Yeah, like, be spotted.
[63:22.22]Then tell her to go right next to him.
[63:27.50]He doesn't see you.
[63:28.48]He sees me now.
[63:29.24]Okay, now he sees you.
[63:30.28]He's choosing to shoot at this other guy.
[63:32.84]Oh, that's the guy we're supposed to rescue.
[63:34.68]Maybe she can't kill the guy who's shooting at the guy we're supposed to rescue for the mission.
[63:39.48]Maybe.
[63:40.28]This seems like a scripted event where we swoop in, save Nick.
[63:44.68]Okay, so just kill this guy then.
[63:56.53]Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[63:58.93]He was trying to, he was trying to light him on fire.
[64:01.57]He's on fire!
[64:02.31]God damn it!
[64:02.91]I was supposed to say he's on fire now.
[64:06.41]Oh, he's down for the count.
[64:07.95]This is a bad first introduction.
[64:09.79]He's just burning on the ground.
[64:17.43]He's gonna get on fire again.
[64:19.51]Yep.
[64:21.55]The fire is spreading, man.
[64:23.25]The trees are on fire.
[64:27.38]All the grass is on fire.
[64:28.56]Are you serious?
[64:30.16]Oh, this is so dumb.
[64:32.84]I think he's safe now.
[64:34.56]He's in conflict, though.
[64:39.26]No, you're not.
[64:39.84]You're fine.
[64:40.28]The fire... Wait, actually, no.
[64:41.36]This is his house, right?
[64:42.80]Yeah, this is his hangar.
[64:45.20]Okay, we're back to normal.
[64:47.50]Oh my god, that was so stupid.
[64:52.79]The fire's spreading fast, man.
[64:54.53]That guy ran all the way across and lit him on fire.
[64:57.35]There's an arcade machine back there.
[64:59.87]I'm telling you right now, this is fucking fun.
[65:02.05]This is way better than Far Cry 4.
[65:03.17]It's been three and a half years.
[65:22.32]This is so dumb and so funny that it's perfect.
[65:26.41]I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm desperate, partner.
[65:31.83]Oh, man.
[65:32.39]Story mission.
[65:32.81]Alright, so we gotta get in a... Reach John Seed's ranch.
[65:36.49]We're supposed to find his airplane and bring it back to him.
[65:41.13]Okay.
[65:42.13]How the hell are we gonna track down an airplane?
[65:48.09]The safe is locked.
[65:50.91]Okay.
[65:52.15]Uh, perk points.
[65:55.11]Got a couple of perk points.
[65:57.35]Seven points available.
[65:58.13]Alright, hold on.
[65:58.55]I gotta look at this for a second.
[66:02.29]There's a lot of things to choose from.
[66:03.99]Primal Mastery?
[66:04.95]Let's just start from here.
[66:09.14]Nimble Fingers.
[66:09.84]It is now quicker to craft items.
[66:12.88]Yadda yadda yadda.
[66:15.22]Move much faster while staying crouched.
[66:18.16]That's cool.
[66:21.03]Unlocks chain, melee throw, and sidearm.
[66:25.33]I don't care what the other options are.
[66:31.10]Don't care what the other options are.
[66:32.20]I don't even care.
[66:35.33]I can throw people now.
[66:52.09]Why was I gonna practice on her?
[66:55.11]We can blow up the safe, can't we?
[66:59.25]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[67:03.64]I just got lied to.
[67:04.36]Oh well.
[67:07.10]What do you mean it's too much shrapnel?
[67:17.92]I mean, do it like they did in the Wild West, you know?
[67:20.42]Alright, let's go get the... Let's go do this.
[67:24.14]Reach his ranch.
[67:26.80]The plane's probably at the ranch, right?
[67:29.76]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[67:33.50]I assume that he had his plane stolen from him.
[67:37.06]Let's get in the... Get in the van here.
[67:42.26]You need C4.
[67:42.98]Oh, well.
[67:44.04]Alright, you want to...
[67:48.89]You want to go?
[67:49.27]You want to drive?
[67:49.81]Alright, where are we going?
[67:54.03]Oh, there's like a hair strip over here.
[67:58.85]Oh, shit, we forgot.
[67:59.39]We didn't check the clock.
[68:00.27]That's right.
[68:01.27]We didn't check the clock.
[68:03.53]Just making a dumb joke.
[68:07.56]None of the panels work in this thing anymore.
[68:14.36]Like, I got this vehicle.
[68:15.88]Oh, um, what happened to our friend?
[68:18.51]Didn't we have a partner?
[68:22.57]Oh, she's back there.
[68:24.15]Is she in the back?
[68:25.31]No, she's all the way back there.
[68:27.29]She's running after the car.
[68:30.41]Yeah, there she is.
[68:32.33]She knows to get off the road.
[68:35.67]They really don't trust the player.
[68:37.55]No, not at all.
[68:38.09]She ran away.
[68:40.07]She's gone.
[68:40.91]No, she's coming.
[68:41.39]I want to get in the back with her.
[68:43.15]I feel like that's more fun.
[68:45.71]Oh shit, this is not a regular truck.
[68:47.37]Never mind.
[68:47.79]Yeah, get in here.
[68:48.51]Nice, there we go.
[68:51.51]You can just crawl around.
[68:57.89]Alright, we're just ranch.
[69:04.37]Okay.
[69:17.85]She needs a better weapon.
[69:20.95]What the fuck was that?
[69:22.15]Oh.
[69:22.87]Okay.
[69:25.09]I'm not really sure.
[69:25.85]I don't know.
[69:26.61]Okay.
[69:28.05]Hello.
[69:28.83]Hi.
[69:29.83]Um.
[69:31.49]I would like to know exactly what happened.
[69:34.49]I don't know what's... I don't know what you've done.
[69:37.40]Are you shooting at me?
[69:38.22]No.
[69:40.26]Why is the whole place on fire?
[69:43.06]Because my...
[69:46.31]My only weapon is a flamethrower.
[69:48.11]Rescue this person!
[69:49.43]She's fine.
[69:51.41]I can't get her.
[69:52.27]I got her.
[69:53.39]Oh.
[69:54.62]I'm gonna die.
[69:55.28]You need to wait till I have some... life here.
[70:02.46]I'm sorry.
[70:03.02]My only weapon is a flamethrower, so... So why do we... It may cause some problem.
[70:07.66]I've created a ring of fire around us right now.
[70:10.47]Alright, is the car okay?
[70:12.16]I don't know.
[70:12.74]I tried to drive it out of the fire, but now it seems to be burning.
[70:16.16]No, it's fine.
[70:17.42]It's good to go.
[70:18.20]Let her get in.
[70:21.58]Where?
[70:22.84]She might have given up on us by now.
[70:24.78]Nope, she's over here.
[70:25.52]Hang on.
[70:26.72]I think I gotta get close.
[70:29.18]She's still going after somebody.
[70:33.88]Stupid.
[70:34.44]Come on, lady.
[70:35.70]Get in here.
[70:36.38]Just hold still.
[70:38.24]She's running away from you because she doesn't trust you.
[70:41.56]No, she's aiming at somebody like a mile down the road.
[70:44.14]Alright, hold still.
[70:47.26]Alright, just go and she'll catch up.
[70:53.68]She'll be there.
[70:54.24]She'll be like right behind us the whole time.
[71:03.43]Alright.
[71:03.97]I don't want to just drive into this.
[71:05.03]We gotta liberate this place.
[71:09.33]She's still just back there doing nothing.
[71:13.47]Is she coming?
[71:13.87]There she comes.
[71:17.11]She'll be here.
[71:17.61]Don't worry about it.
[71:18.51]Alright.
[71:18.75]So we got to liberate.
[71:20.57]We have to liberate this outpost, and then we get the aircraft that is somewhere buried within.
[71:24.75]But they're already spying me.
[71:26.11]Yeah, they are.
[71:26.51]Alright.
[71:28.87]Should we throw her up there and just make her run straight in?
[71:31.09]Alright.
[71:31.99]I'm rolling.
[71:32.39]Watch my back.
[71:33.10]Hold on.
[71:33.34]Are you getting some tags?
[71:35.60]There's a lot of people here.
[71:38.04]Yeah.
[71:38.40]Alright.
[71:38.70]So try to get her to get the guy up top.
[71:42.13]You know what I'm saying?
[71:42.75]Like priority target this dude.
[71:43.71]She's going.
[71:45.25]She's on the way.
[71:46.11]She on the way?
[71:46.57]Mm-hmm.
[71:47.83]Okay, good.
[71:49.00]Here she goes.
[71:51.84]Diana's got heart.
[71:53.34]No fear.
[71:53.94]Alright.
[71:54.42]She's got spunk.
[71:56.26]Oh, she's changing direction.
[71:58.84]Got a little cold feet there.
[72:00.28]A little cold feet.
[72:00.96]There she goes.
[72:01.34]There she goes.
[72:01.72]Up the ladder.
[72:02.08]Come on.
[72:02.44]Up the ladder.
[72:03.83]Oh, do something amazing.
[72:04.83]Throw him over the edge.
[72:07.71]Come on, Diana.
[72:08.31]Come on, Diana.
[72:09.61]Come on, Diana.
[72:12.67]Oh, baby, did you see that?
[72:15.25]Perfect.
[72:16.87]Where are you going?
[72:22.96]No, she's not gonna actually... You might as well have her do the whole job.
[72:31.29]Wow.
[72:33.17]She's so good.
[72:35.94]Diana, that was perfect.
[72:37.24]There's another one coming up.
[72:38.80]She's going to do another one?
[72:39.92]Yeah, she's going to do another one.
[72:44.34]How is she going to get over there?
[72:45.84]Look at those legs.
[72:46.78]She's like Sonic.
[72:47.88]She really is so fast.
[72:49.86]She goes, alright.
[72:50.70]I don't know.
[72:51.16]She's going up to the guy on the banister, like next to the banner where it says, together we march to Eden's Gate, like that guy up there.
[72:58.15]I see.
[72:58.67]I'm so glad we have binoculars.
[73:00.47]She's just going to appear through the door.
[73:04.03]She's navigating the whole house right now.
[73:10.88]we can't let her lose we gotta get her come on man we gotta get her she's dying right now this is where we're at
[73:41.39]What does that mean?
[73:41.87]What does that mean?
[73:43.31]The alarm?
[73:44.17]No, somebody's dropping like a bomb down here.
[73:46.91]I'm getting her.
[73:50.77]She good?
[73:51.05]I don't think so.
[73:52.89]She won't get revived.
[73:54.19]Get up!
[73:55.01]I can't get her.
[73:56.17]Oh, come on.
[73:56.80]Really?
[73:57.18]I can't pick her up.
[73:57.84]I can't get her.
[73:59.84]No!
[74:00.34]No!
[74:02.00]Diana!
[74:05.60]She's temporarily unavailable.
[74:07.22]I had to.
[74:10.28]It was over.
[74:18.66]whoa whoa whoa I'm getting hurt this may help are you alright oh Diana was so good too I'm so sad about this wow this gun well nice nice work uh this gun's a little powerful you're gonna have to see what it does but we lost Diana she was we did lose Diana but maybe she'll come back you know
[74:49.03]She was better than both of us combined.
[74:51.35]Yeah.
[74:52.69]She was definitely sneakier.
[74:54.83]She was definitely faster, too.
[74:57.01]Alright, so, uh... I wish there was a bad guy down here.
[75:02.12]Do they have to be a bad guy?
[75:04.34]Or could there just be a guy right here?
[75:06.22]I feel like... Okay.
[75:09.08]He's got, like, a diamond over his head.
[75:10.70]Isn't that, like, a quest thing?
[75:11.80]I don't know.
[75:12.10]He's a guy.
[75:12.60]You're looking for a guy.
[75:13.40]That's not what I wanted.
[75:18.39]This guy's definitely got a quest.
[75:25.86]The outpost may not like us very much anymore.
[75:32.24]The planes over here.
[75:33.31]That guy was so unnecessary.
[75:35.61]What?
[75:36.37]Okay.
[75:38.45]So what you didn't see was when I was actually fighting the bad guys, the 50 cal would pick them up and throw them about 10 feet backwards.
[75:46.35]Really?
[75:46.69]Okay, well, that's good to know.
[75:49.05]Got a map now.
[75:49.81]Alright, the plane's over here.
[75:52.69]Somewhere in here.
[75:53.29]Where's the map?
[75:54.21]We gotta get, like, in the garage.
[75:57.17]Where's the map?
[75:58.35]I just picked it up back here.
[76:00.39]It's on this little ledge here.
[76:04.15]Right here.
[76:05.85]Shop.
[76:08.10]Ammo.
[76:08.42]Refill your ammunition.
[76:09.38]Buy and customize aircraft.
[76:11.94]Why is this a shop?
[76:13.52]Well, I have bears in my pocket.
[76:16.91]Oh, no.
[76:17.27]Okay.
[76:17.49]I was going to say, huh?
[76:20.63]We sell skins and stuff?
[76:26.99]I mean, I guess I just sold everything.
[76:30.57]Apparently.
[76:31.95]Refill the ammo.
[76:36.05]I don't think there's a reason to keep any of those things, right?
[76:39.05]I don't think so.
[76:40.31]Buy silver bars with real USD.
[76:42.51]Are you serious?
[76:45.03]Yeah.
[76:46.16]Don't even think.
[76:46.74]Don't even tell me.
[76:48.14]I'm assuming that... But they're not loot boxes, though.
[76:51.62]Where is this magical plane that's not here?
[76:55.59]Run out of ammo, gamers?
[76:57.49]I don't want to alarm you or anything here, but there's no plane to get in.
[76:59.61]It's supposed to be, like, right here.
[77:02.11]Really?
[77:02.79]Enter Nick's plane.
[77:05.23]I don't... You in a plane?
[77:12.52]I am.
[77:12.94]You're in a plane.
[77:14.02]I am in a plane.
[77:14.74]Okay.
[77:15.72]What does it look like I'm doing?
[77:17.28]You are jumping up and down.
[77:18.76]Go ahead and just take the plane out of the hangar for all of us to see.
[77:23.29]Nice.
[77:25.23]Okay.
[77:27.99]Go for a test drive, man.
[77:32.23]Okay.
[77:34.36]This is more complicated than the helicopter, I'm just saying.
[77:38.98]Mm-hmm.
[77:45.22]You're too far from your partner.
[77:46.80]Hang on, let me fix that.
[77:55.81]My game is broken.
[77:57.77]I can't do anything.
[78:02.93]Well, that was fun.
[78:04.69]What happened?
[78:05.36]Because I'm at a loading screen.
[78:08.08]I don't see you anymore.
[78:09.64]You're just a dot on my radar, and the plane's definitely stuck.
[78:14.51]so okay wait that was fun nope not not stuck uh I'm at a never-ending loading screen how did I just use that to slingshot take off oh no uh
[78:40.03]How do you slow this thing down?
[78:41.59]I'm still loading a long loading screen.
[78:43.95]It's almost done.
[78:45.93]I'm not sure where I'm going to end up here in a minute, but maybe I'll... Who knows?
[78:51.04]Okay.
[78:52.06]I have the option to parachute.
[78:53.88]Since you just teleported to my position, is that true?
[78:56.64]I don't know.
[78:57.48]I may have.
[78:58.14]I'm still sitting here looking... Oh, we're loading screen again.
[79:05.28]Try not to drive like can you like just kind of drive in the small circle because I have a feeling I kind of have been driving I'm like I'm just gonna come down here and try to land if I can figure out how to slow this down because what's gonna happen here is I'm gonna teleport to your location in the fall.
[79:17.69]This is probably what's gonna happen How do you land?
[79:28.65]I can hear you.
[79:29.35]I have come to a complete stop.
[79:30.87]You're at a complete stop.
[79:31.93]Alright.
[79:32.27]Yeah, I
[79:35.14]Maybe you should just beat the mission and then I'll be in the game.
[79:42.57]Well, I mean, I'm on top of your dot.
[79:44.33]I see you moving around.
[79:45.33]Alright, well, I'm almost loaded again.
[79:49.94]Okay, almost there.
[79:50.82]There I am.
[79:53.02]Your teammate was teleported to your position.
[79:55.34]Uh, nope.
[79:55.62]I'm gonna have to rejoin your game.
[79:57.58]I can hear you shooting.
[79:59.50]I'm not shooting.
[80:01.28]You're not shooting.
[80:02.12]Someone else is, but I'm not.
[80:03.70]Okay.
[80:04.40]I have to get out of here.
[80:07.48]Yeah, I think I'm in like a fly the plane story segment.
[80:10.18]Okay, so here's what you're going to do.
[80:11.45]I'm going to reload from checkpoint.
[80:13.29]I'm going to just... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[80:17.13]Okay.
[80:18.25]That worked.
[80:19.63]So that controlled your game also.
[80:21.25]It did.
[80:21.79]So I was perpetually stuck because I don't have an airplane in my game.
[80:27.18]What did it look like?
[80:28.18]You were just floating around, you were just flying around as a guy.
[80:31.56]And, ladies and gentlemen, uh, figuring it out.
[80:36.78]Ready?
[80:37.38]I'm ready.
[80:39.23]Do I have to fly?
[80:40.69]I think I do, but... Can you, you should be able to do stuff back there, right?
[80:45.23]Uh, no, I can just kind of sit in here.
[80:48.65]Yeah, because I have, like, a bomber view and a machine gun.
[80:51.81]Oh, I don't.
[80:52.31]I'm just a guy in the car.
[80:53.39]Hi.
[80:54.61]I'm just a guy that sits in a car.
[80:56.87]I think you should be able to shoot something.
[81:00.81]I can do all kinds of stuff.
[81:02.07]I think I might be in a little bit of a glitched out trouble here because this doesn't seem right.
[81:07.42]So I'm just going to let it do its thing and hopefully we can get to the end of this mission.
[81:11.68]Because I don't think the game thinks I'm supposed to be in here right now.
[81:14.58]I mean, there's definitely a seat for you.
[81:16.62]I can't even leave.
[81:19.17]I can't either.
[81:19.75]I can't even get out of the car.
[81:21.11]I think you can't get in out because it's a story thing.
[81:25.75]But normally, that's why we have parachutes though, right?
[81:28.11]Yes.
[81:28.37]For planes.
[81:30.51]So it's alright.
[81:31.17]You can beat Superman 64 while I just watch.
[81:33.13]It's fine.
[81:33.98]Why is co-op buggy?
[81:35.10]It's what makes it more fun.
[81:36.04]It's a beautiful game.
[81:39.10]Look at that.
[81:39.40]Beautiful game.
[81:40.28]Beautiful scenery.
[81:45.38]He's flying the plane, huh?
[81:46.94]Can you see the loops that I'm flying through?
[81:49.30]Oh, yeah.
[81:50.48]Okay.
[81:53.20]This is the teach you how to play the plane segment.
[81:59.75]Which comes with a gatling gun.
[82:01.53]Okay.
[82:02.37]Okay.
[82:03.59]Also bombs.
[82:04.17]You can drop bombs, too?
[82:06.17]Yeah.
[82:06.51]You can drop bombs, also.
[82:07.71]And you get a separate bomb dropping.
[82:10.06]I heard that Superman 64 joke three times now.
[82:15.11]Well, it's the most obvious reference to make.
[82:18.58]What joke?
[82:19.38]Superman 64 flying to the ring.
[82:21.82]Oh.
[82:23.04]I mean, what else am I going to say?
[82:26.18]Nights into Dreams?
[82:27.22]Is that better?
[82:28.48]Might be.
[82:31.80]God damn it.
[82:32.22]Remind it.
[82:32.54]Kind of like Nights into Dreams.
[82:34.00]There you go.
[82:35.30]I don't even know what you're referencing.
[82:37.76]They just bombed some ducks.
[82:47.33]I should stream nights.
[82:49.89]That game is pretty crazy.
[82:50.81]Yeah, it is on Dreamcast, isn't it?
[82:53.55]Enjoying being your chauffeur for this segment.
[82:55.81]You can respond to chat.
[82:59.97]Speaking of.
[83:00.63]Star Fox.
[83:02.50]Yeah.
[83:02.78]Ooh, look at those elks.
[83:16.48]Lego Avengers.
[83:22.51]Do you feel like this segment is going on a little too long to teach you how to fly through rings?
[83:27.33]They want you to see the sights, you know?
[83:31.13]Look at this guy.
[83:33.19]That's a bear.
[83:35.14]Easy with this.
[83:35.78]Yeah, if I crash now, we have to do the whole thing over.
[83:40.18]Elk is already plural.
[83:41.34]Yeah, but elks is funnier.
[83:42.28]What's in the water down there?
[83:44.36]Elks.
[83:49.74]You're also getting some Nick flying lore.
[83:54.62]Yeah.
[83:59.24]Under the bridge.
[84:01.16]Are you gonna do it?
[84:01.94]You're gonna go under the bridge?
[84:02.80]Yeah.
[84:03.56]Don't you fuck this up.
[84:05.43]That's a difficult maneuver to do right now.
[84:07.95]You got confidence in this?
[84:08.77]Yeah.
[84:09.09]Oh, yeah.
[84:09.67]Okay.
[84:10.23]Alright.
[84:10.47]You already destroyed?
[84:17.34]I love how you have to just sit in the back for this.
[84:19.22]Yeah, I can't even do anything.
[84:22.52]I get to hang out with you.
[84:25.06]That's all I get to do.
[84:25.80]Yeah, you get to just like listen to my sound effects.
[84:30.94]Yeah, this is... and your head and your body is taking up 20 to 30% of the whole screen.
[84:37.58]So I just get to see the back of your head shake back and forth.
[84:42.09]And the left and right sides of my screen.
[84:49.66]Looks like it's kind of fun.
[84:50.42]I cannot even move.
[84:51.04]I am trapped in here.
[84:51.78]I can move the camera, but I can't do anything else.
[84:53.22]Why are we going sideways here?
[84:55.78]We're sideways.
[85:13.07]This looks so much fun.
[85:14.47]Tell me about it.
[85:15.11]It is.
[85:16.23]Uh, well, eventually maybe we can fly two planes at once, and then you can have one, and then I can have one.
[85:20.27]Alright, the jittering is, is gonna, gonna drive me crazy, so I'm gonna find a, okay, there's no jittering here, so I'm just gonna do this for the very, like, this part of the stream.
[85:28.71]Because it is shaking around so much that it's actually probably giving people a headache.
[85:32.65]So, here we go.
[85:33.15]Here's a good spot for you to see, like, uh, did not get a headache.
[85:38.00]Nice.
[85:39.70]Thanks.
[85:40.02]Alright, I think we're done.
[85:43.71]I got a turn, man.
[85:48.31]Yeah, I'm looking at the clouds.
[85:50.27]No, this is the image.
[85:51.25]Have you guys ever laid down in the backseat of a car during a long road trip?
[85:56.52]We're looking out the side window right now, lying down.
[85:59.52]Just contemplating.
[86:02.02]Figure out how to land.
[86:03.50]Yeah, we gotta land.
[86:06.20]Diana Madison is now available in the roster.
[86:09.38]Nice.
[86:10.14]We can hire her again.
[86:14.78]Okay.
[86:16.27]Hold C. Good work.
[86:18.45]That was a very hard landing.
[86:20.43]Go to the hangar.
[86:23.77]Diana is back.
[86:25.77]She is.
[86:26.67]She's ready to rumble.
[86:33.28]So here's the real problem here.
[86:35.50]I hope I can get out of the plane.
[86:38.06]Okay, here we go.
[86:40.97]good this is a story mission the cutscene did it for me mash F why oh oh I see I see what you're saying
[87:10.54]I like that you just unquestioned it.
[87:12.08]I thought you were trying to skip something.
[87:14.56]No.
[87:15.94]Sorry for your chat, by the way.
[87:22.28]F is being said a million times?
[87:26.69]Yeah.
[87:27.55]I'm glad I could help him out.
[87:30.87]Yeah, you did a good job.
[87:31.59]We all enjoyed watching that.
[87:34.53]You were some good moral support, too, you know?
[87:37.61]I almost threw up in the backseat.
[87:42.77]Grandpa first got it when he got back from World War II.
[87:44.89]Oh, Grandpa?
[87:46.45]Whoops.
[87:48.01]What, did you skip the cutscene?
[87:50.58]Now that it's loaded, yeah.
[87:52.58]What?
[87:53.12]Maybe I shouldn't have, though.
[87:56.34]Well... Because we have to secure his house.
[88:00.53]I think he came under attack during that cutscene.
[88:05.23]I was prepared to give him the microphone for, like, a few minutes.
[88:08.91]A minute or two?
[88:09.99]But if, like, he's at the Oscars, they start playing him off at that point.
[88:18.67]Got one.
[88:22.67]Wait, you're- I think I'm doing a good job so far.
[88:27.32]Are you distracting him?
[88:28.24]Because I'm doing the actual securing of- How is this guy still alive?
[88:34.27]And I can't even fucking hit him with a goddamn gun.
[88:39.73]Like, where did he go?
[88:42.11]He's hiding in the bushes.
[88:46.43]Secure the house.
[88:51.61]What are you doing in there?
[88:52.19]How did I go so long without using the shovel?
[88:56.63]Is that guy in the car?
[88:58.73]Oh, dear.
[88:59.19]Well, that was a mistake.
[89:00.71]Who's left?
[89:03.39]Come help me.
[89:04.41]I'm trying.
[89:04.85]Guy behind.
[89:10.26]You are covered in blood right now.
[89:11.50]Is that a bad guy?
[89:13.82]Did they steal the plane?
[89:15.20]So he's just flying around.
[89:16.00]In the hangar.
[89:16.48]Get in the hangar.
[89:17.20]Secure the hangar.
[89:18.74]Apparently people are saying finally we've learned about the shovel.
[89:36.67]Have you learned about the... Not yet.
[89:41.63]Maybe I should.
[89:43.21]Maybe you should.
[89:44.67]It's getting me killed, though.
[89:46.31]Look, hit Q, then mouse down to your melee, and mouse wheel until you get to your melee weapon.
[89:51.13]I have a throwing knife.
[89:59.59]Alright, well, that was very anticlimactic, but it's fine.
[90:02.53]I'll take it.
[90:07.08]You gonna spear somebody with a shovel?
[90:08.98]Yeah, watch.
[90:09.94]Here it comes.
[90:14.54]A shovel!
[90:14.92]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[90:19.55]I can grapple that?
[90:23.59]How do you grapple?
[90:26.31]How do you- I think you only grapple on grapple points.
[90:29.53]Yeah, there's a grapple point right over here at the roof of the house.
[90:35.98]Did he say he was going to blow up the snipers or something?
[90:37.76]I think he said he was just going to give us covering fire on the roof, but I... Ooh, here we go.
[90:43.97]Oh, I see.
[90:52.45]Well, that guy... I found a gun with a scope on it.
[90:56.12]That guy popped up in the air for some reason.
[91:03.78]I think it's this gun.
[91:06.16]Still trying to steal his shit.
[91:11.52]There's actually like bullet travel.
[91:14.60]Yeah, there is.
[91:15.84]That's pretty cool actually.
[91:16.62]Don't get too close.
[91:17.92]I'm gonna drop a bomb on these guys.
[91:24.15]How's that guy?
[91:25.85]Don't get too close.
[91:30.07]I'm gonna drop a bomb on these guys.
[91:30.93]Don't get too close.
[91:31.49]I think he's referring to you.
[91:32.53]Me?
[91:33.37]I'm on the roof.
[91:34.17]He's gonna drop a bomb on you, right?
[91:38.00]Who is he talking about?
[91:38.82]He just dropped the bomb, like, in the middle of the runway.
[91:43.20]I don't know.
[91:46.78]There are a lot of guys.
[91:49.50]See ya.
[91:51.72]Do you have the, like, assault rifle with the big scope on it, too?
[91:54.60]I just have a single-shot rifle.
[91:56.14]Alright, we good?
[91:58.41]Alright, don't skip this.
[92:01.11]Okay.
[92:01.35]Jeez.
[92:03.81]Thought that's what you wanted.
[92:04.81]Yeah.
[92:05.69]That like breathe in noise.
[92:33.68]You talked about handing off the business to our daughter.
[92:38.00]I talked about handing off the business to our son.
[92:40.34]You've seen the ultrasound.
[92:42.06]It's a girl.
[92:43.20]That was on a messy black and white TV screen.
[92:45.38]You know them things ain't reliable.
[92:46.92]Nick.
[92:53.72]Do it for the baby.
[92:55.84]Okay.
[92:58.14]He's so happy.
[92:58.81]I love you.
[93:02.32]Me too.
[93:03.22]I love me too.
[93:04.32]Yeah, I love me as well.
[93:06.70]Well, deputy, looks like the Rye family's digging in.
[93:11.47]Hey, listen, if you need any air, you give me a holler, okay?
[93:17.15]You and me, we'd be like Butch and Sundance.
[93:20.97]Nick, they both died at the end.
[93:23.98]Foreshadowing.
[93:27.24]Please take care of him.
[93:32.15]So we can actually remember everyone's favorite gun for hire.
[93:38.62]Don't leave the tax documents on the ground.
[93:41.24]He's our new gun for hire.
[93:43.26]Cool.
[93:44.26]So we can use him for the rest of the game.
[93:47.16]Alright.
[93:47.47]Well, awesome.
[93:47.95]What do you say we continue?
[93:51.25]Let me hire him.
[94:00.31]Let me go to my perks.
[94:04.92]Prepare a torch.
[94:06.06]King of the Jungle.
[94:10.58]Oh, the Black Market.
[94:13.30]Where's the wingsuit?
[94:18.20]Locksmith.
[94:25.31]Health boost, health boost.
[94:26.27]Where is the wingsuit?
[94:29.44]Is there a wingsuit?
[94:30.94]Hey.
[94:31.70]Come here.
[94:32.06]Yeah, I mean, it's a Far Cry game.
[94:33.34]Of course there's gonna be a wingsuit.
[94:34.52]Where the hell is it?
[94:36.00]I think we have to probably unlock it.
[94:39.74]He's a good kid.
[94:40.40]What?
[94:41.18]Take care of him, Deputy.
[94:41.98]What do you want?
[94:42.46]That family's a symbol of hope for this whole town.
[94:45.75]What?
[94:45.97]That she's just here?
[94:46.69]Yeah.
[94:47.81]She's just here.
[94:48.81]Oh.
[94:49.07]She's just here.
[94:49.93]I called her in.
[94:51.97]But she, like, snuck up on you.
[94:54.93]She's back.
[94:55.45]Hooray!
[94:55.99]Alright.
[94:56.59]Let's go.
[94:59.58]I gotta keep the dreams alive.
[95:05.08]Alright.
[95:06.12]Anywhere on your map you want to mark?
[95:08.86]Uh, well... Let's go do... We're like in John's region right now.
[95:16.41]We'll get in because she's going to drive.
[95:18.81]Diana's going to drive, yeah.
[95:20.71]She's in the driver's seat.
[95:25.11]Take us anywhere.
[95:26.27]Take us where we want to go, Diana.
[95:29.91]You need to work on your posture a little bit.
[95:31.19]Maybe I need to tag somewhere for her to go.
[95:33.89]Tag something?
[95:36.07]Let's go do, like... Do you want to, like, liberate something?
[95:42.91]Just go to a random residence.
[95:45.25]Go blow stuff up.
[95:46.97]We just did a couple of story missions.
[95:49.13]Just pick, like, a random spot for us to liberate.
[95:53.37]Okay.
[95:53.49]Okay.
[95:58.05]Let's just kind of goo.
[96:01.30]I don't know what some of these markers are.
[96:02.66]Go blow up a silo.
[96:04.94]I'm just going to have a cinematic camera on her.
[96:14.29]She literally will just follow the waypoint.
[96:16.43]Okay, cool.
[96:19.36]Alright.
[96:20.90]Nice work, Diana.
[96:22.82]Always one.
[96:24.42]Always one.
[96:26.00]Let's go kill the cult VIP.
[96:27.72]Is it VIP?
[96:28.92]Yeah, let's go kill him.
[96:33.07]What?
[96:34.53]She just leaned into the camera.
[96:36.39]What are you doing?
[96:37.83]We're going to go kill the cult VIP.
[96:39.13]He's like right back here.
[96:40.35]She just did this crazy fucking camera leaning.
[96:43.65]It was perfect.
[96:45.38]What is this?
[96:45.90]What is this?
[96:51.55]Got him.
[96:54.27]Did you?
[96:54.85]I did, yeah.
[96:56.17]He's still going.
[96:57.79]Yeah, that's because he's still on the gas.
[97:02.01]This has got like a crate icon on it.
[97:06.46]There's another car coming right here.
[97:10.70]He's dead.
[97:11.04]I think that was a civilian.
[97:13.28]Was it?
[97:14.34]Yeah.
[97:15.30]Why do they all drive like psychos?
[97:19.46]Can we break into this?
[97:24.23]There's a magic button on the side.
[97:25.77]Where is she running to?
[97:27.71]That opens the door.
[97:29.51]What is that?
[97:30.99]It's a flamethrower.
[97:33.87]Oh, is it?
[97:34.33]Nice.
[97:34.61]I'm going to try the flamethrower.
[97:37.01]Oh.
[97:37.19]Are you trapped in there?
[97:38.85]I'm definitely in here.
[97:40.07]I don't know if you're supposed to be, but here I am.
[97:43.31]Can you get out?
[97:54.46]okay alright we gotta get her in here we have to be we have to get in the back of the truck once she drives it okay alright can she get in the truck I don't know maybe make she'll get in maybe I'll get in the front seat well you get just to make sure you'll get back here too well I know I'm going to I just wanted to get in the car let me set like a there's a bear now she's fighting a bear
[98:21.30]That came out of nowhere.
[98:22.80]Okay.
[98:24.32]Alright, see if she'll get in.
[98:30.53]I don't think she's going to get in the car.
[98:31.59]Oh, come on.
[98:33.75]Go ahead, get in here.
[98:45.13]Come on.
[98:46.75]We want to just get in the back while she drives.
[98:48.47]She's just looking at me.
[98:51.06]Make her drive into the fucking middle of nowhere while we have to stand in the back.
[98:55.92]Also, maybe I am stuck now.
[98:59.48]Will she even get in the car if I get in the front seat?
[99:04.08]Where is she?
[99:04.44]There we go.
[99:06.22]Is she getting in?
[99:08.23]No, she's not.
[99:10.59]Yeah.
[99:11.61]No, you are.
[99:12.77]I'm trying to make it so... Nah, I think she's kind of stuck in.
[99:15.21]I have to shoot things.
[99:16.37]I think we have to drive forward a little bit.
[99:19.33]Yeah, just drive.
[99:22.45]Oh.
[99:23.45]I accidentally ran her over.
[99:24.59]It's alright.
[99:29.77]Careful, you're going to run her over again.
[99:31.81]The thing... The tongue is sticking out still.
[99:36.05]How did I get up here?
[99:36.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[99:37.67]There are guys back here.
[99:38.81]There are guys back there, yeah.
[99:41.49]Hold on.
[99:43.49]They're good guys, though.
[99:44.47]They're good guys.
[99:45.17]Oh, fuck!
[99:45.43]God damn it!
[99:46.24]What are they doing back there?
[99:47.48]They're good guys, man.
[99:49.48]I thought that was like a... The targeting reticule was white, and now this guy's scared.
[99:52.86]I thought that was like a car full of fucking bandits or something.
[99:55.66]The civilians let one go, and the other one's murdered.
[99:58.56]I thought it was like a GTA party of people.
[100:00.36]Alright, let's go.
[100:02.44]You want to drive, or you want me to drive?
[100:05.15]Uh, let's just... Look, these guys are like right back here.
[100:09.89]Fine, you're right.
[100:16.82]We have to kill this VIP, right?
[100:19.26]Yeah.
[100:21.56]Easy.
[100:26.39]There ain't nobody at this waypoint.
[100:27.89]I see a boat.
[100:29.91]Maybe they, like, vanished because we went too far away?
[100:32.89]Possible.
[100:38.37]I mean, there's a boat here.
[100:41.93]I don't think they're back here.
[100:43.49]Who's shooting, then?
[100:44.39]There's a helicopter shooting a boat.
[100:45.33]There's a helicopter!
[100:48.40]There's a bad guys in a helicopter right now.
[100:50.30]Yeah, no, I am it is a fucking animal She's still shooting at Diana Alright.

[101:17.44]Don't say that, don't say that.
[101:23.94]I'm taking all the credit for that one.
[101:25.28]Come on, have you seen Ghostbusters where Rick Moranis is shooting the building?
[101:29.36]And everybody cheers for Rick Moranis?
[101:37.60]And he didn't even do it?
[101:38.50]Alright, we're gonna get in the boat.
[101:39.38]Are you talking to me or are you talking to Chad?
[101:40.46]Talking to everybody.
[101:40.88]Also, there's a person swimming under here.
[101:43.64]Is it a bad guy or a good guy?
[101:45.62]It is a person trapped in the upside-down world.
[101:49.52]Really?
[101:49.80]Let's investigate.
[101:54.35]There's really nothing we can do.
[101:56.99]Like, powers beyond our control would be necessary.
[102:01.61]They're underneath the boat.
[102:03.45]No.
[102:04.13]No.
[102:06.34]Oh, I see what you mean.
[102:11.94]I tagged this person earlier and now she's hiding.
[102:16.91]Uh, stand back.
[102:21.23]Get Diana out of here.
[102:22.13]Get her to a safe place.
[102:24.85]I'm gonna torch this fucking place.
[102:31.49]That might actually scare the AI to make it move away from the fire.
[102:34.83]Yeah, here she goes.
[102:36.49]She's in the water.
[102:37.23]Is she inside the water?
[102:38.91]She's right here.
[102:39.37]Wait, what?
[102:44.05]I mean, she's... I'm so confused.
[102:46.23]I can see her, but she's in the tree.
[102:48.07]Okay, hold on a minute.
[102:51.86]Let's make this work.
[102:56.92]Oh.
[102:58.80]Almost.
[103:00.61]Okay, hold on.
[103:02.71]I can see it flipping through.
[103:04.57]She's got a hold of me, I think.
[103:05.93]I can't... There we go.
[103:07.17]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[103:08.21]Stand back.
[103:09.27]Stand back.
[103:09.57]Stand back.
[103:09.87]Stand back.
[103:10.15]Stand back.
[103:10.45]Stand back.
[103:19.47]And... we're back.
[103:21.31]Alright, as if it never happened.
[103:24.60]Oh, my fucking teeth!
[103:26.06]I just hit my teeth with my fucking drink.
[103:28.88]Yep.
[103:29.70]What the fuck?
[103:33.70]Yep.
[103:35.20]That was unexpected.
[103:37.56]She... I just cut... Okay, she was hanging by a thread.
[103:41.27]I just cut the thread and she dropped like 500 feet.
[103:44.13]Ow, my fucking teeth.
[103:45.17]Jerma, I got breaking news.
[103:46.71]Breaking news.
[103:48.37]BooMan61 is in the chat.
[103:50.65]BooMan61 is in the chat.
[103:52.84]Hey, Boo.
[103:53.32]What is he just fucking... He says hello.
[103:54.98]He's just... BooMan61!
[103:57.44]Does... Hey, hello, boys.
[103:59.12]Uh, what's going on, Boo?
[104:04.40]Ghost busted.
[104:06.70]Plane.
[104:07.71]Free plane!
[104:09.15]I'm heading this way.
[104:12.07]I get to try... I get to try and drive a plane now.
[104:14.79]Oh my god, yes.
[104:16.21]Cover me.
[104:17.66]Don't let them get- don't let them get me.
[104:19.66]How do you fly a plane?
[104:21.00]Are you in the plane?
[104:23.62]Should I- how do I do this?
[104:26.76]Is it inverted?
[104:27.34]Etalyx?
[104:31.70]Etalyx, how do you fly the plane?
[104:36.51]Oh no.
[104:36.93]Okay, turn?
[104:41.59]Oh my god.
[104:43.57]Where is he?
[104:43.89]Etalyx, are you in the plane right now?
[104:51.14]What happened?
[104:52.10]Okay, it's inverted.
[104:56.24]I don't even know if I have any friends right now with me.
[105:02.77]Just flying away, I guess.
[105:08.17]No, he's in the plane.
[105:10.99]Where's Diana?
[105:18.85]Are you trying to scare me?
[105:20.13]I'm trying to find out if you're inside with me.
[105:23.13]How do I pull the landing gear up?
[105:27.70]I'm pretty sure this is one of those planes where you do not pull the landing gear up.
[105:30.94]Alright, so where are we going?
[105:33.04]I think it just stays there.
[105:34.30]Can you mark something for me?
[105:35.90]Okay.
[105:37.58]I can do that.
[105:38.78]Let's get a mark.
[105:39.74]What are we going to do in a plane, though?
[105:41.22]I'm going to land it, obviously, somehow.
[105:43.28]Okay.
[105:44.20]Do we want to stay in this area that we've been in?
[105:46.60]Okay, let's go do the armed convoy.
[105:49.18]Yeah.
[105:49.32]There you go.
[105:49.62]I marked it.
[105:50.28]Marked on the map.
[105:50.98]You got it.
[105:51.32]Alright, give me a sec.
[105:55.63]Diana's running after the plane, and she made it.
[106:00.39]Just watch her.
[106:00.93]Can you watch her from where you are?
[106:02.65]I can only see her little diamond icon.
[106:04.75]Okay, because she's... And that's it.
[106:06.49]Alright, let's just go this way.
[106:10.59]Before crash?
[106:11.23]No.
[106:11.31]Does this plane have guns or bombs or anything?
[106:14.25]I do not have a gun.
[106:15.55]Oh.
[106:16.35]Not all planes created equal then.
[106:18.55]Do a barrel roll.
[106:19.57]Okay.
[106:22.41]You're doing a loop.
[106:24.05]Okay.
[106:25.57]That was a good corkscrew, actually.
[106:27.23]I'm impressed.
[106:27.95]I mean... Come on, guys.
[106:29.83]Come on.
[106:30.15]You don't think I'm capable of something like that?
[106:33.44]I'm going to land over here.
[106:39.42]Let's decelerate a little bit here.
[106:43.05]Make it nice and easy.
[106:43.89]Alright, if you... C, I think, slows the plane down.
[106:47.99]Yep.
[106:49.61]Doing good.
[106:52.44]Look at that.
[106:55.64]Look at that.
[106:56.50]And we got a plane for when we need it next.
[106:58.72]I'm a little disappointed, I'm not going to lie.
[107:00.59]What, that I didn't crash?
[107:01.43]Come on.
[107:01.83]Yeah, no, I was absolutely expecting the, alright, here we come in for a landing, and the pilot's gone, and you just jump out of the plane and leave me in the back.
[107:10.19]I did a corkscrew.
[107:11.63]How is she here?
[107:14.25]Look at this bear.
[107:16.01]Go have a fight that bear.
[107:17.13]Oh, wait, it's gone.
[107:18.83]There's like so many bears, it's not like this is the only opportunity.
[107:21.79]There was a bear chasing his tail over here, and then he disappeared.
[107:23.81]Alright, let's just go to this.
[107:28.28]Is this a scarecrow?
[107:29.46]Eagle.
[107:30.98]Have her fight the eagle.
[107:32.22]There's cows.
[107:33.00]One of them is a bad cow.
[107:34.72]She can go fight the cow.
[107:35.80]She can go fight the bad cow.
[107:37.50]Look, one of them's red.
[107:38.51]The other two are white.
[107:39.45]So that means one's hostile.
[107:40.69]The other two aren't.
[107:41.57]Where do you see this?
[107:42.43]Oh, over here.
[107:42.89]Oh, okay.
[107:43.31]I see what you mean.
[107:45.13]See what she can do.
[107:48.01]Really?
[107:48.35]She just opened fire immediately.
[107:50.31]What do you expect her to do, though?
[107:51.82]Take her gun away from her.
[107:54.44]Here comes another plane.
[107:58.74]Can we get that plane?
[107:59.46]Can we, like, commandeer that plane?
[108:00.56]That's the guy.
[108:01.26]Oh, that is the guy.
[108:02.06]I think that's the guy's plane that we rescued.
[108:04.98]Alright, let's move.
[108:05.88]Let's go.
[108:06.70]What?
[108:06.88]We're just in the middle of a field.
[108:08.44]Yeah.
[108:09.12]Oh.
[108:10.34]What is this?
[108:11.24]This guy has, like, a meat grinder.
[108:15.10]That was all Diana.
[108:15.94]What?
[108:17.66]I almost just got ground up.
[108:20.52]I'm sorry for what I'm about to do, Jarmo.
[108:22.18]Why?
[108:22.42]He's not mean.
[108:24.26]He is mean.
[108:25.50]How do I turn on the meat grinder?
[108:30.02]It's just on.
[108:31.26]Alright, let's see if I want to grind somebody up.
[108:32.86]Hold on, hold on.
[108:36.02]Yeah, you get a good view of this, because I'm going to turn somebody into, like, hamburger meat.
[108:40.23]There's a guy dead ahead, 12 o'clock.
[108:41.57]Just drive forward.
[108:42.85]Left.
[108:45.09]Straight ahead.
[108:46.31]Oh, yeah, I see.
[108:52.19]He's kind of just standing there.
[108:55.09]Can we stealth kill him with the meat grinder?
[109:23.61]Why wouldn't you get out of the way?
[109:30.26]I need a second.
[109:30.82]Hold on.
[109:31.10]Like, for real.
[109:33.98]Why wouldn't you get the fuck out of the way?
[109:36.48]Unbelievable.
[109:55.70]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[109:58.22]Are these guys gonna get off the car?
[109:59.66]Hold on.
[110:00.00]Can I ride up the car?
[110:03.88]I don't think so.
[110:07.80]Etalyx, you need to shoot.
[110:09.88]Why are you not shooting somebody?
[110:12.80]Why are you throwing cans?
[110:14.22]Diana!
[110:15.95]No!
[110:21.87]Diana's still alive.
[110:24.11]I think Diana can get up and save us.
[110:26.56]Nope.
[110:29.98]He was just throwing cans of corn at people.
[110:40.97]He was just sitting on top throwing paint cans.
[110:48.99]Oh my god.
[110:50.60]Well, here we are.
[110:51.66]I think Diana's still here.
[110:54.28]Oh, apparently I was muted.
[110:55.94]Oh, yes you were.
[110:57.02]The whole time?
[110:58.12]Uh, for like the last 30 seconds.
[111:00.26]Why are you just throwing, like, cans at people?
[111:03.20]I was throwing shovels.
[111:04.74]Oh.
[111:04.94]As I've explained to myself, uh, four times now.
[111:08.20]Oh, alright.
[111:09.26]Yeah, I was trying to spear the guys off the map.
[111:11.52]Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey.
[111:14.93]What did you just do?
[111:15.61]I just threw shovels, man.
[111:17.55]Oh.
[111:21.83]Why did you kill that turkey?
[111:22.59]I need help!
[111:25.53]I mean, stop hurting people.
[111:27.73]Stop being such a bad person.
[111:28.71]Just use the shovel.
[111:31.89]I don't have a shovel.
[111:33.01]Yeah, you do.
[111:33.79]Just hit Q. I don't have one.
[111:35.51]I have my hands.
[111:37.08]And then mouse wheel.
[111:39.44]I have nothing.
[111:40.82]You haven't picked up a shovel this entire time?
[111:43.30]No, I got fists.
[111:45.44]Alright, well pick this one up then.
[111:49.26]Uh, I don't think I can.
[111:50.28]Oh.
[111:52.98]It's only my shovel.
[111:54.73]You haven't picked up a single melee weapon.
[111:56.63]No, I have, but I've thrown them all.
[111:58.73]Oh, I see.
[111:59.67]Alright, let's go.
[112:01.13]Let's do this.
[112:03.53]What are we going to do exactly?
[112:05.55]I don't know.
[112:06.19]Something fun, man.
[112:07.25]No plane.
[112:08.33]No, no plane.
[112:08.87]Plane is a bad idea.
[112:10.46]Plane is fun, but, like, not now.
[112:16.80]Let's just do the convoy that we were going to do, and then we got killed by them.
[112:19.58]Okay, destroy John's truck.
[112:22.81]Diana, will you relax?
[112:23.79]How many convoys are there?
[112:25.82]There's three.
[112:27.64]One in every direction here.
[112:29.72]West, east, and the north.
[112:31.30]Alright, so let's get a car.
[112:34.52]How many shovels do you have?
[112:36.83]Lots.
[112:37.13]I think you can carry like three at a time.
[112:40.85]They're all up here in front of us.
[112:42.57]Alright, hold on.
[112:43.57]There's a helicopter.
[112:45.40]Actually, you know what?
[112:46.06]The plane would be useful if it had guns on it.
[112:48.78]We could just strafe the whole convoy.
[112:50.46]You know, we could.
[112:51.84]Kill?
[112:52.10]There's a VIP cultist up here.
[112:53.44]Do you have any weapons I can reach?
[112:57.76]They can what?
[112:58.32]They can reach these guys up top here?
[113:02.96]Uh, yeah.
[113:05.34]What do you got?
[113:05.74]I got one sniper with an OK.
[113:08.26]They're going to drive directly towards us anyway.
[113:10.53]Oh, that's fine.
[113:11.03]I'm just going to torch the car.
[113:18.70]That is surprisingly effective.
[113:20.46]Yeah.
[113:24.52]That guy's still alive here.
[113:26.30]Dude on fire right here.
[113:27.10]Alright, he's dead.
[113:29.10]Alright.
[113:29.76]Oh, come on.
[113:31.80]Really?
[113:32.84]Come on.
[113:34.28]Here comes the VIP.
[113:36.30]And I can buy a guy on an ATV.
[113:43.73]He's on fire.
[113:44.41]Haha.
[113:47.15]Did that work?
[113:48.29]Did I get the dynamite?
[113:50.45]I think you did.
[113:52.07]Oh, watch it, watch it.
[113:53.55]Random psycho.
[113:54.45]Jesus.
[113:55.03]That's a civilian.
[113:55.95]I didn't do that.
[113:56.99]Don't kill the civilian.
[113:58.21]I have to.
[114:00.90]We're going to get like the Assassin's Creed game over.
[114:02.62]Okay, fine, fine, fine.
[114:03.20]Alright, we're good.
[114:05.74]Did the VIP have anything on him?
[114:10.18]He's just over here, right?
[114:10.96]Dead on the ground?
[114:13.60]Is he underneath?
[114:14.88]Okay, well, I guess.
[114:16.88]He's wicked witching it right now.
[114:18.20]Alright, we need a car.
[114:23.05]Whatever, I'm just getting onto the ATV.
[114:28.41]She's on this with me.
[114:29.17]Alright.
[114:29.87]Can you get on this too?
[114:30.75]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[114:31.65]I need to commandeer that vehicle, sir.
[114:34.93]Can you get on this?
[114:37.03]Three people on the ATV?
[114:37.99]Can three people get on the ATV?
[114:39.45]I can kick her off.
[114:40.51]That's about it.
[114:41.26]Alright, well, um, I kind of want her on here.
[114:44.97]I feel more safe with her here.
[114:46.23]Okay, and someone else will be along.
[114:47.53]Hang on, let me just see if I can get on the front.
[114:49.73]Can you just stand on it?
[114:50.57]Mm-hmm.
[114:51.83]You can.
[114:52.17]Okay.
[114:52.47]Can you stay there?
[114:54.41]For now.
[114:55.45]Okay.
[114:57.69]Yeah, that's fine.
[114:59.31]I'm alright with this.
[115:01.83]Uh, there's a roadblock up here you might want to be, uh, picked via, and there's, like, spike strips.
[115:05.77]How am I not supposed to run into that?
[115:06.79]There's spike strips down.
[115:11.00]Look, I'll be your lookout.
[115:12.92]I'm up in the crow's nest right now.
[115:14.54]I'll just put the binoculars out.
[115:15.83]I love your body.
[115:17.75]Your shirt with the wind going through it looks perfect.
[115:21.49]Alright, VIP action.
[115:24.09]You good?
[115:25.17]Yeah.
[115:25.33]I mean, I'm good.
[115:26.13]Are you good?
[115:26.67]I'm good.
[115:28.26]I'm going to go right through this.
[115:29.16]Be careful.
[115:30.70]Hold still.
[115:33.92]How is it possible that the only guy I killed was a civilian?
[115:37.50]How is that possible?
[115:39.46]Are you on?
[115:41.85]I thought we were gonna kill him.
[115:45.27]Alright, fine.
[115:46.37]Shoot the big explosive.
[115:54.22]Blow up!
[115:58.78]Give me that shit.
[115:59.44]I want that.
[116:05.35]You alright?
[116:06.55]I'm okay.
[116:15.85]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[116:16.75]I need some med kits.
[116:17.77]Me too.
[116:18.81]Ah, shit.
[116:19.29]I'm in trouble.
[116:22.43]This dude's possessed.
[116:24.49]Come on, help me, Diana.
[116:26.17]Diana, you are so good.
[116:27.47]We will never get rid of you.
[116:29.33]Is she really that good?
[116:30.99]She just revived me.
[116:31.79]She's like a great partner.
[116:35.87]We're playing with a third person, Diana.
[116:37.65]We are, yeah.
[116:38.11]We just have an extra co-op partner.
[116:42.93]Is that guy just stepping on you?
[116:44.77]Oh, no.
[116:45.29]I was just shooting you.
[116:46.25]I was kicking it.
[116:47.13]Yeah, you were shooting me while I kicked him.
[116:49.25]Come on.
[116:49.55]Show your face.
[116:53.13]Watch out.
[116:53.43]What?
[116:53.79]Oh, my.
[116:54.61]Really?
[116:56.27]Who is this?
[116:56.93]Yeah, why are we playing Battlefield right now?
[117:00.15]I'm not going to save this person.
[117:03.67]Are you on the roof?
[117:07.95]No, Diana's on the roof.
[117:08.95]Battlefield moments.
[117:10.25]It really is just Battlefield.
[117:11.79]It really is, yeah.
[117:16.34]What about over here?
[117:17.00]Who's this?
[117:17.30]Is this the guy we have to save?
[117:19.82]I think the plane is bad.
[117:21.86]I think we have a new... Yeah, we have a new... I think there's a new quest NPC over here now.
[117:27.94]Watch this battlefield moment.
[117:28.96]It's going down!
[117:32.28]Yeah, that guy's... What just happened?
[117:36.31]Only in battlefield.
[117:37.25]I thought we... Alright, we did it.
[117:41.85]We have a new NPC over here.
[117:45.61]That was a close one.
[117:51.85]Congratulations.
[117:54.05]Sad you didn't get to witness that.
[117:55.69]I mean, I saw the plane crash and explode.
[117:58.24]Yeah, I was there.
[118:00.16]Like, I was on the roof where the plane exploded.
[118:03.06]Nice.
[118:04.64]Whatever.
[118:05.60]Don't appreciate me.
[118:07.14]You like Diana better?
[118:08.46]I see how it is.
[118:09.93]She was really nice.
[118:10.59]No more death or mourning or crying or pain.
[118:14.83]Was this a story mission?
[118:16.27]I believe we... Well, this guy had a... That thing over his head that was like, he's important.
[118:21.19]This is a guy I went in and, like, liberated.
[118:25.07]He was a hostage.
[118:29.08]Oh, yeah.
[118:29.58]He was, like, a hostage at the beginning, wasn't he?
[118:31.82]Yeah.
[118:32.92]In the tutorial.
[118:34.00]Getting quite a reputation, deputy.
[118:41.01]Why is Diana not here?
[118:41.89]She should be right over here.
[118:42.91]I have to pee.
[118:43.73]Alright, while this cutscene plays out, I'm gonna go pee.
[118:49.73]I'll be right back.
[118:50.49]All you've done?
[118:50.97]Might as well add Mover to the list, huh?
[119:12.73]Thought that Eden's Gate confiscated all of this.
[119:16.55]What kind of fairground would I be if I didn't have a hidden stash?
[119:24.28]Learn from the best.
[119:29.46]This town... ...has been through a lot, Deputy.
[119:35.02]We owe you thanks, but... I know you're looking for your people.
[119:39.33]But the truth is you ain't the only one in need of help.
[119:43.37]The pastor and I can only do so much.
[119:47.71]If you can see about lending a hand, be sure to return the favor.
[119:55.52]What do you say?
[119:58.48]I still don't know what we did to trigger this.
[120:00.27]Let's buy some strong stuff.
[120:07.78]Found that one out back.
[120:10.00]Hope you study your memory verses.
[120:18.61]Are you alive?
[120:19.11]What happened to Jerma?
[120:26.89]He's not muted, but he... Did he go take a pee break?
[120:30.43]When I was muted?
[120:33.20]Did he do a cutscene pee break?
[120:34.78]Whatever, I got Diana.
[120:35.72]I don't need him.
[120:36.88]Okay.
[120:37.06]Well.
[120:37.24]That's fine.
[120:38.56]Like I said, I already got what I need.
[120:45.18]Why is this shovel is $4,000?
[120:47.48]My people will come for you.
[121:00.15]They will bring you to me.
[121:01.71]Don't fight it.
[121:02.43]Because the harder you resist, well... No, I just, I figured it out, though.
[121:08.73]I used context clues.
[121:10.45]Used context, you could use clues?
[121:12.15]Context clues?
[121:13.21]Yeah, I used context clues.
[121:14.71]Yeah, I tried to say, hey, hey, hold on a second.
[121:17.02]Okay.
[121:18.26]Okay, alright.
[121:18.86]We just had a little drink, and looking in the shop, and everything's very expensive.
[121:23.92]Well, it seems like it.
[121:24.78]Alright, let's see.
[121:26.30]Got a happy face shovel.
[121:28.56]That's $4,000.
[121:30.77]Okay.
[121:32.04]What about the Gears of War shotgun?
[121:34.84]Oh, sorry.
[121:35.40]My bad.
[121:35.96]I'm talking about the Team Fortress 2 shotgun.
[121:38.72]It's like a factory... No, this is Minimal Wear.
[121:41.74]Is that not a grenade launcher that you're looking at?
[121:44.02]No, this is a Team Fortress 2 Minimal Wear shotgun.
[121:47.79]Whatever this one is from one of those crates.
[121:52.65]Don't say that curse word.
[121:54.43]What?
[121:54.75]Team Fortress 2?
[121:57.99]I want this one.
[122:00.43]It reminds me of that one developer who doesn't make video games anymore.
[122:03.51]Now, this one's only $570.
[122:04.17]What about a baseball bat?
[122:06.31]I own it.
[122:06.95]How come I don't have it?
[122:09.91]Can you just switch to whatever thing you already own?
[122:12.87]I don't know.
[122:13.21]Maybe.
[122:13.49]This one's aluminum.
[122:19.49]Customize.
[122:20.91]Baseball bat.
[122:24.86]Swap with empty.
[122:27.44]You can put paint on it and stuff.
[122:30.51]I kind of have to do, like, the funny one, right?
[122:33.05]What, the smiley face?
[122:34.49]Oh, that's $700.
[122:35.33]I don't think I want that.
[122:38.36]These ones are cheaper.
[122:42.32]This one's $200.
[122:43.56]Birch.
[122:44.32]Sure, why not?
[122:45.22]What funny skins are you looking at?
[122:46.98]The baseball bat?
[122:48.08]Yeah.
[122:48.92]Did you buy the baseball bat?
[122:50.72]I already owned a baseball bat, but I just put a skin on it, apparently.

[123:31.97]No, I don't want a hat.
[123:35.15]Alright.
[123:36.11]Med kit's probably going to buy a bunch of these, right?
[123:40.13]You've been marked.
[123:42.53]Body armor.
[123:43.07]I'm going to get it.
[123:43.63]Okay.
[123:47.87]Weapons.
[123:48.67]How do I even... How do you get to your actual... I am stuck.
[123:51.09]That's it.
[123:51.51]I don't know.
[123:52.25]But you're standing in the doorway.
[123:54.47]Oh, sorry.
[123:55.73]Oh, yeah.
[123:55.97]I've got a baseball bat now.
[123:56.81]See?
[124:01.96]Got an Uzi.
[124:02.38]I'm alright with the Uzi.
[124:03.80]You got an Uzi.
[124:04.36]Yeah.
[124:06.76]Instead of the Uzi, I'm going to take this one instead.
[124:09.06]No.
[124:09.52]Alright.
[124:09.78]Where do you, like, switch weapons?
[124:11.95]I think it's in tab here, isn't it?
[124:14.59]Somewhere in here.
[124:15.91]Inventory.
[124:16.57]There is, like, an inventory.
[124:17.63]Yeah, there's an inventory backpack.
[124:19.83]I don't think it... I'm not sure what it means, though.
[124:23.15]Throwables.
[124:25.41]I think that's for, like, crafting stuff.
[124:27.23]I do have, like, five perk points, though.
[124:30.48]Yeah, I spent them on my super tech counts.
[124:32.02]Use the repair torch to open safes.
[124:34.36]Okay, another one.
[124:36.52]Here's the wingsuit.
[124:37.92]Yeah, the wingsuit's in there too.
[124:40.48]How much is the wingsuit?
[124:42.00]It's four points.
[124:44.78]Okay.
[124:46.62]No, too bad.
[124:47.40]I think I can do that right now.
[124:49.52]No.
[124:52.92]Where is it?
[124:53.50]What category is it under?
[124:56.51]Oh, there it is.
[124:58.24]Unlocks the wingsuit.
[124:58.86]Use it by pressing shift and switch between parachute and wingsuit in mid-flight, allowing you to cover more distance.
[125:03.39]Really?
[125:04.15]Oh, that's cool.
[125:04.85]Yeah, so I'll get that next.
[125:08.37]Alright, you wanna destroy these trucks so we can get this off the mini-map here?
[125:12.75]Yeah.
[125:18.47]What are we closest to?
[125:22.61]Oh, she's aiming at the helicopter up here.
[125:29.01]You don't typically think of a cultist in a helicopter.
[125:31.43]That's funny.
[125:35.79]Alright, we need a car.
[125:40.97]Who's that?
[125:41.37]I don't know.
[125:45.43]Go to Yes Mountain.
[125:47.15]I'm sure we'll end up there eventually.
[125:50.60]You got a car up there?
[125:55.24]You also may be muted.
[125:59.72]In fact, I guarantee it.
[126:05.33]Helicopter, helicopter.
[126:06.31]Yeah, we'll eventually... What is it?
[126:08.29]Somebody's being chased.
[126:09.65]Yeah, someone is being chased.
[126:13.15]There's someone next to us, too.
[126:14.23]Oh, okay.
[126:16.95]I'm about to die.
[126:18.37]What the fuck?
[126:22.09]What's wrong with me?
[126:26.93]This guy is fully armored, and I am drugged.
[126:29.13]Yeah, I'm also drugged, too.
[126:32.66]Oh, we need... Okay, apparently we need to use bliss bullets on these guys.
[126:36.58]We failed the mission, I guess.
[126:37.74]I guess we became addicted to the drugs, and now we're part of the cult.
[126:43.42]Yeah.
[126:45.57]It tasted good, honestly.
[126:46.75]Oh, was this supposed to happen?
[126:51.73]Yes, this was supposed to happen.
[126:54.50]Wow, look at that organic quest.
[126:56.54]I didn't even know I was in a story mission.
[127:09.79]Are we getting baptized right now?
[127:14.17]I think we are.
[127:15.79]By force.
[127:16.35]A little bit drowning.
[127:22.98]Is Diana here too?
[127:25.26]She's in the cutscene too.
[127:29.27]Really?
[127:31.59]I mean, that's her, right?
[127:34.91]I don't know.
[127:39.66]Not this one.
[127:44.26]Ryan Reynolds has a problem with us, I think.
[127:47.08]This one's not clean.
[128:02.33]So what this is just a drug that's here yeah there and
[128:30.04]Making us see everything in a different light.
[128:33.53]Despite all that you have done, you are not beyond salvation.
[128:39.49]Are you sure?
[128:40.63]I did meat grind a guy.
[128:44.03]It's one of those drugs where the happy pills make you think you're doing things that are really good and fun, but you're actually like slaughtering everyone.
[128:51.91]You didn't know that you were running over him with a meat grinder.
[128:54.72]You thought you were just, you know, playing go-karts, playing bumper cars.
[129:04.84]This one shall reach the atonement.
[129:10.68]Or the gates of Eden shall be shut to each other.
[129:14.46]Not that.
[129:14.96]Anything but that.
[129:15.46]Did the guys get gunner optics on?
[129:23.08]Yeah, that makes him... He's going to be really hard when we get in a 1v1 firefight with him at the end of the game.
[129:31.74]You will confess.
[129:32.56]Aviators are still cool.
[129:34.40]They'll always be cool.
[129:35.52]Every sin you've ever committed, no matter how petty, no matter how small.
[129:42.94]Only one earring.
[129:43.76]So how are we going to get out of this?
[129:46.30]Are we going to get rescued?
[129:47.20]I mean, I'm assuming we're going to get rescued by somebody.
[129:50.34]You'd hope so, right?
[129:52.51]Or we're going to have to do a mission for him.
[129:59.57]What if they did a 180 here and we actually are on their side now?
[130:04.01]I'd be down with that.
[130:05.17]We're just the bad guys for the rest of the game?
[130:07.07]Maybe.
[130:07.37]If we just confess.
[130:09.19]If we confess right away, we'll be okay, right?
[130:11.88]No.
[130:12.90]It'll make it worse.
[130:14.10]Why?
[130:16.03]Which one of these guys are you?
[130:20.27]Is that you?
[130:22.39]I think we're both in the same first-person perspective.
[130:25.32]I know, I'm just saying.
[130:26.90]You're like this guy on the right here.
[130:28.88]And this is Diana.
[130:35.34]Was she driving the car?
[130:36.48]I don't understand.
[130:38.75]No, we're getting rescued.
[130:39.77]Okay.
[130:52.03]Alright.
[130:55.61]We're good.
[130:58.41]Jesus take the wheel.
[130:59.47]That was the joke I was looking for.
[131:04.07]Didn't they already do this in the very beginning of the game?
[131:05.93]We already did this once.
[131:08.33]You're upside down.
[131:09.25]Get out of the thing that's upside down.
[131:10.89]The Call of Duty you mean?
[131:13.15]Yeah.
[131:16.27]Who killed him?
[131:16.77]Show them no mercy.
[131:20.63]You alright?
[131:21.25]That was dangerous, Father.
[131:22.91]I could have been killed in that accident.
[131:27.12]Didn't go through all this trouble just to lose you now.
[131:31.02]Alright.
[131:35.61]Oh.
[131:36.59]Alright.
[131:37.91]What in the name of God?
[131:40.03]I'm going in.
[131:41.15]Hi.
[131:41.61]Where's Diana?
[131:43.21]There's no explanation for what I just saw.
[131:45.13]You know what?
[131:45.59]Diana's taking a backseat for a second.
[131:47.26]Let me switch a route.
[131:49.82]Don't do anything yet.
[131:52.12]Don't do anything.
[131:52.94]Diana's going to die.
[131:54.26]I can't call.
[131:54.82]Is she alive?
[131:55.96]She's lying on the ground.
[131:56.74]Why is she over there?
[131:58.30]She's getting firing squatted right now.
[132:03.43]That's not Diana.
[132:04.59]Those are other good guys.
[132:06.65]Okay.
[132:08.49]Moving up.
[132:10.33]Are we going to win a double baseball bat here?
[132:12.42]Yep, double baseball bat going in.
[132:13.86]Yep, you got it.
[132:21.43]I think you're hitting me with your baseball bat, but that's okay.
[132:23.95]Hang on.
[132:27.17]One more.
[132:28.74]One more.
[132:29.18]One more guy.
[132:32.40]Nice takedown.
[132:33.06]Gotcha!
[132:35.40]One more guy.
[132:36.88]Nope.
[132:37.16]That guy disappeared.
[132:38.38]This guy's on our team?
[132:39.90]Yep.
[132:40.02]There's guys on the roof.
[132:40.86]There's guys on the roof.
[132:42.94]Alright.
[132:43.20]I'm going to go around this way.
[132:44.54]Nope.
[132:44.78]And more.
[132:45.50]Watch out for these two.
[132:48.83]I'm down.
[132:49.51]You're down?
[132:50.41]I'm down.
[132:51.17]Clinging to life.
[132:52.87]Ooh, ooh, got him.
[132:54.73]There's a car.
[132:56.21]Car?
[132:56.65]Baseball bat him.
[132:58.13]Wait till he gets out.
[132:59.73]Instant win.
[133:00.51]Nice job.
[133:02.95]There's so many more.
[133:04.69]Where they at?
[133:05.13]Okay, I see him.
[133:06.71]Throw the baseball bat.
[133:08.13]No, I'm going around the side.
[133:10.35]I'll distract him.
[133:11.39]Keep him distracted.
[133:14.89]Where are they?
[133:15.31]They're still distracted.
[133:16.96]Where are they?
[133:17.44]Oh, they ran forward.
[133:18.86]Okay, got it.
[133:19.40]Yeah.
[133:23.17]I ran all the way around the circle for no reason.
[133:25.29]Yeah, for no reason whatsoever.
[133:27.71]Up top, though, there's two snipers.
[133:29.77]Two snipers on the top of the roof.
[133:31.15]Yeah, on the roof.
[133:36.82]I just have an option to do a parachute.
[133:40.00]Alright, good work.
[133:41.56]Been taken care of.
[133:42.56]Got it.
[133:47.62]Any more?
[133:47.94]I think that's everybody.
[133:57.75]That was so not worth it.
[133:59.03]That was so dumb.
[134:01.87]Okay.
[134:03.04]We're at Eden's Gate.
[134:03.74]You got it.
[134:04.14]The only problem is one of these people that's here is a plant!
[134:13.00]Yeah, he didn't like that too much.
[134:15.96]I got the spy.
[134:16.45]Don't worry.
[134:21.19]I like how they all have a different interrupted... Yeah, they do.
[134:25.69]Dialog.
[134:25.91]I like how all the bad guys are the same B.A.B.
[134:26.93]model.
[134:27.11]Yeah, they really are all just B.A.B.s.
[134:28.89]Alright, find Merle.
[134:29.87]Well, I guess we're going up there.
[134:50.12]Well, I think we found him.
[134:51.98]I'm getting in with these guys who have a very clear mission.
[134:56.01]Okay, well, I'm going to try to get in that car, too.
[134:58.83]Good luck, because I'm not driving.
[135:00.79]Okay.
[135:01.13]What do you mean you're not driving?
[135:03.07]Got it.
[135:03.61]I got it.
[135:03.91]I'm in.
[135:06.50]He made a little boo-boo in the steering.
[135:08.62]Okay.
[135:09.98]I found it.
[135:10.60]Oh, you're in the back.
[135:17.46]Is that a bad guy?
[135:18.22]No.
[135:18.86]Uh, that was one bad guy.
[135:20.64]Okay.
[135:24.32]Got a hostage here.
[135:25.14]Another hostage.
[135:28.78]What?
[135:35.63]Uh, what?
[135:36.27]What'd he say?
[135:38.85]I'm gonna fuckface!
[135:42.95]Oh, goddammit, man.
[135:44.23]Why?
[135:47.21]I can't do it.
[135:48.57]Go in the glowing cave.
[135:49.45]Missile!
[135:50.37]Okay.
[135:51.31]Or that's fine too.
[135:52.49]Yeah, let's go.
[135:53.67]But there's no cave here.
[135:54.99]It's just a... It's just a flare.
[135:59.59]Alright, now we go.
[136:02.64]In between bombs.
[136:03.86]Maybe we just go from green cave to green cave.
[136:07.54]I'm fine.
[136:08.20]In between bombs.
[136:12.14]No.
[136:12.30]There are medkits on the way.
[136:13.66]I need your help.
[136:14.62]Oh, I see.
[136:15.49]Yep.
[136:17.19]Wait for the next bomb.
[136:20.31]Alright.
[136:20.87]Fireworks are done.
[136:22.15]I'm coming.
[136:23.45]You took a very strange path.
[136:28.14]Alright.
[136:31.92]Oh, come on.
[136:32.50]Really?
[136:32.76]I'm fine.
[136:35.24]Are you okay?
[136:35.56]Yeah.
[136:36.36]No, I'm good.
[136:36.92]Let's go.
[136:37.28]Come over here.
[136:39.96]Come to me.
[136:40.86]Watch out for the bombs.
[136:41.42]Watch out for the bombs.
[136:44.08]Alright.
[136:44.61]See you later.
[136:46.72]Oh no, I can just walk there.
[136:49.40]From here.
[136:50.18]I got a plan.
[136:50.80]I got an idea.
[136:51.74]There's a bridge.
[136:53.38]Yeah, there is a bridge.
[136:54.50]That's quite the plan.
[136:55.68]Good idea.
[136:57.75]Rewarded for originality there.
[136:59.39]Okay, sounds good.
[137:03.31]Alright, here we... Oh, well.
[137:12.36]I can use the mortar.
[137:16.67]Is that a bad guy right there?
[137:19.07]No, wait, no, no, no.
[137:20.35]Well, there's going to be an issue here in about five seconds.
[137:22.33]I'm sorry.
[137:26.11]Wow.
[137:26.75]We're fine.
[137:29.01]That was fun, though.
[137:32.39]Oh, I can aim it.
[137:34.80]I don't know if I can even do this.
[137:35.88]I mean, this is the guy.
[137:38.08]Are you ready for me to trigger this?
[137:40.36]I mean, I'm just, yeah, whatever.
[137:41.58]I'm just hanging out.
[137:47.03]How do I get off?
[137:47.57]Okay, you got it.
[137:52.09]I'm going to need to use this.
[137:53.59]Survive?
[137:53.95]Hold your ground.
[137:54.63]Yeah, we have to survive for two minutes.
[137:56.53]Okay, I'm going to assume... I've got a shotgun.
[137:58.24]Where are they coming from?
[137:59.30]Because I'm going to drop a missile on them.
[138:02.08]Down here?
[138:03.54]Yep, alright, I got it.
[138:06.60]Boink.
[138:13.48]Did I do it?
[138:15.26]You certainly got the bridge.
[138:16.78]I got it.
[138:17.32]Good.
[138:20.20]Guys over here.
[138:23.51]Then go.
[138:24.21]See you later.
[138:25.49]Tagging some dudes for you.
[138:27.15]Very good.
[138:29.93]Real cooperation.
[138:30.55]There's only one guy left here.
[138:31.79]I can get him.
[138:34.42]Watch out underneath the bridge.
[138:35.26]A couple of guys that are... I don't know what they're doing down there, but...
[138:43.58]Guy got in here.
[138:44.58]Guy got in.
[138:45.60]Guy got in.
[138:51.07]Yeah.
[138:51.63]No, I'm fine.
[138:51.99]I'm fine.
[138:52.41]That he did.
[138:54.55]Guy got in here.
[138:55.53]Guy got in here.
[138:56.37]I like the PUBG.
[138:58.91]Guy.
[138:59.33]Guy.
[138:59.47]Guy.
[138:59.65]Guy.
[138:59.79]Guy.
[138:59.95]Guy.
[139:00.11]Guy.
[139:00.87]Guy?
[139:02.01]No.
[139:02.69]Okay.
[139:02.97]You remember playing PUBG?
[139:05.24]Whatever.
[139:05.84]I'm trying just to use this thing.
[139:08.16]Don't even know me.
[139:09.12]You don't even know me.
[139:10.76]I don't.
[139:11.06]Hit the bridge.
[139:12.96]Shoot the bridge.
[139:15.16]Shooting the bridge.
[139:21.12]I'm trying to run away.
[139:22.16]I'm going to shoot right at him.
[139:24.90]Watch out.
[139:25.36]Careful.
[139:25.63]I think there's a guy up here.
[139:26.83]I got him.
[139:30.21]I'm dead.
[139:30.45]Okay, there's a guy.
[139:32.17]I guess a guy actually is up here.
[139:35.75]What just happened there?
[139:36.61]Why didn't you shoot that guy?
[139:38.73]Me?
[139:40.65]What am I supposed to be guarding you the whole time?
[139:42.61]Is this a bad guy?
[139:43.41]Who is this?
[139:45.71]Is this a bad guy?
[139:46.59]This is the VIP.
[139:47.29]No, this is the good guy we're supposed to protect for three more seconds.
[139:51.65]Four seconds.
[139:52.19]You thought he was me, right?
[139:54.81]Why is that going to get rid of a helicopter?
[139:58.52]It's a good guy helicopter.
[140:00.04]Oh.
[140:02.05]We're supposed to get in the helicopter because they're just endlessly running down the bridge right now.
[140:06.67]I'll do one more.
[140:07.31]One more mortar is going up there.
[140:11.21]Alright.
[140:11.43]Make it happen.
[140:11.81]He's landing.
[140:12.21]He's landing.
[140:15.69]Get off the thing.
[140:17.19]Okay.
[140:17.41]Is he landing?
[140:17.97]Good.
[140:18.17]I'm going to get in.
[140:25.43]Okay.
[140:25.65]We're in.
[140:28.23]I wish I- does he need to get in?
[140:30.89]Here he comes.
[140:31.67]Merle's getting in.
[140:32.53]He looks like that one guy with the mullet from The Walking Dead.
[140:36.33]I hated that character.
[140:40.53]Who knows what these bastards- Oh shit, you can actually swing this in here.
[140:44.99]Okay, yeah, I need to be careful.
[140:46.01]I have my bat out.
[140:46.73]Come on, go faster!
[140:55.67]No, don't give me this power.
[140:57.59]I can't.
[140:58.09]No, I'm not shooting him.
[141:03.99]He can't die.
[141:07.15]He can't die.
[141:07.85]Well, you can share.
[141:08.63]That guy can't die.
[141:09.73]This guy can't die.
[141:11.19]This guy right here, yeah.
[141:13.05]He's unkillable.
[141:14.99]It is affecting his driving, though.
[141:17.81]What am I...
[141:25.84]I don't know if he can land if we're getting shot.
[141:31.93]For one second, I thought that eagle was an actual eagle that was coming at us.
[141:35.87]Attack eagle.
[141:39.87]I really did.
[141:40.83]Swooping in.
[141:41.27]Right there.
[141:42.01]Freeze frame right now.
[141:47.84]We're good.
[141:54.22]Why isn't my baseball back?
[141:58.24]Did I break it?
[141:59.68]By the way, we still have to... There's Diana.
[142:01.42]She's back.
[142:02.82]There's a lot of soldiers here.
[142:04.32]We still need to... No, we don't.
[142:07.95]Okay.
[142:09.51]There's a lot of conversations happening.
[142:11.51]Yeah, there are.
[142:12.25]And music.
[142:14.37]There's loud music.
[142:15.25]Oops.
[142:16.83]Okay.
[142:18.37]So, we have a helicopter here for free.
[142:19.89]Might as well use it, right?
[142:31.50]Let's find out what we want to do next.
[142:40.61]Let's just do the armed convoy.
[142:42.37]Did I just kill you?
[142:46.09]No, but I am still... I am hurting.
[142:48.39]I think I'm blowing people around with this thing.
[142:53.62]I know what's coming next.
[142:55.50]I tried to blades this guy, but did I?
[142:57.40]I don't even know if I did.
[143:00.44]You want to get in here?
[143:01.88]I'm in.
[143:02.54]Oh, you are in.
[143:03.16]Okay.
[143:03.64]Yeah, I'm in the back.
[143:06.70]I can actually shoot out the side.
[143:08.54]Holy shit.
[143:09.12]Watch out for the trees.
[143:09.98]Okay.
[143:10.54]Let's go destroy this thing.
[143:12.12]Destroy the convoys.
[143:12.94]600 meters away.
[143:16.65]So I'm just going to lean in there and you make it happen.
[143:28.70]Diane is in here too.
[143:32.25]Wow, okay.
[143:33.37]She's in here.
[143:36.97]I'm going to drop down low.
[143:39.19]So you can aim out the window.
[143:40.35]I'm on the right side.
[143:42.70]So if you want to go down, I can throw some... I'm going to be very gentle about this.
[143:50.64]What is this electric field to the right?
[143:52.24]Do you see that electric box?
[143:55.17]With a guy in it?
[143:56.79]I want to know what that is.
[143:59.75]We kind of need to... I can't shoot from here.
[144:04.07]We're going to have an issue.
[144:04.97]Yeah, you think so?
[144:06.75]She's gone.
[144:07.45]She just jumped out.
[144:10.19]She parachuted.
[144:11.29]She does not trust your flying anymore.
[144:13.23]She's gone.
[144:15.78]We appear to be hovering in place sideways for me.
[144:19.90]The thing's going down.
[144:21.38]All I hear is alarms.
[144:22.90]I'm getting out.
[144:27.38]I think I'm actually going to be able to land this.
[144:28.96]I landed it.
[144:31.56]We're fine.
[144:32.80]All I heard was a thump.
[144:35.25]We're good.
[144:35.61]It's like a perk for repair torch.
[144:36.97]You could fix it.
[144:37.69]Do we have enough perk points for that?
[144:42.13]I don't know.
[144:42.97]Do you?
[144:43.29]Let me see if I do.
[144:45.99]No, I have one perk point.
[144:48.09]I got five.
[144:50.31]Where's... We need to keep going.
[144:54.04]I can get it.
[144:54.66]Hang on.
[144:54.98]You want to do it and repair and we'll just keep going?
[144:58.53]I'll use your perks.
[145:01.85]Where is it, though?
[145:02.47]Right here.
[145:04.37]I mean, like, how do you use the... Oh.
[145:08.76]Yay, you did it.
[145:09.80]It actually is a battlefield moment.
[145:12.40]Um, when does it stop making noise?
[145:13.92]Alright, that's fine.
[145:15.88]Can she fly the helicopter?
[145:17.68]When does it stop making noise?
[145:19.14]It's still smoking on top.
[145:20.42]It's... You almost got it falling.
[145:21.96]She can fly... Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.
[145:24.44]She's flying the helicopter.
[145:25.14]Get in.
[145:27.91]Let me on!
[145:28.77]Did you get on?
[145:30.35]She won't leave me.
[145:31.01]She's my companion.
[145:32.09]Alright, so jump and get it.
[145:32.95]Can you... Damn it.
[145:34.70]She's just far enough away where I can't reach.
[145:36.52]Alright, what happens if you run down the street?
[145:41.90]Is she gonna follow you in this thing?
[145:44.50]I don't know.
[145:44.98]Oh my god.
[145:48.12]Yeah.
[145:48.50]Wow.
[145:48.98]She does.
[145:49.72]This is unbelievable.
[145:56.95]You can just tell her to drive.
[145:59.91]Wait.
[146:00.49]Here we go.
[146:06.06]Now we're talking.
[146:06.46]Alright.
[146:07.08]Are you... Classic.
[146:08.26]Are you attached?
[146:10.86]So now... Are you going to mark something somewhere?
[146:13.45]Yeah.
[146:15.13]Alright.
[146:16.45]Well, she's going to crush you.
[146:18.45]She's going to crush me, yeah.
[146:20.77]Here we go.
[146:23.10]She's driving this like a car.
[146:24.74]She's driving it like a car.
[146:26.78]You need to fly at least 100 feet in the air.
[146:31.67]There is definitely an issue here.
[146:35.77]Why is she driving it like a car?
[146:36.99]I don't know why she's doing this like it's a car.
[146:40.59]I can almost get in, though.
[146:42.65]Can you get in?
[146:43.63]I can almost get in.
[146:44.59]She's just doing it so erratic.
[146:46.27]She's turning to face me.
[146:48.11]She's like turning in to face me.
[146:50.84]These guys have to die.
[146:51.64]I'm in.
[146:53.00]Nice.
[146:53.22]Okay, let's get out of here.
[146:57.08]Go.
[146:57.62]I have a target marked.
[146:58.95]Just figure out how to get there.
[147:00.69]Oh, God.
[147:04.45]Landing?
[147:05.81]Why is she landing over there?
[147:07.95]I marked the convoy.
[147:10.01]Oh.
[147:11.06]I'm assuming she's going to go to the convoy.
[147:13.00]She looks like she's going to go land over here.
[147:22.29]no she's changing her mind I think I had marked a spot for her so I had to like clear the marker and redo it they're aiming like sniper rifles up here at us there I just gave her like a new command to go to my waypoint oh I get it whenever I set a waypoint it creates a landing spot yeah but like I don't think she can I can like tell her where to go
[147:47.42]Ah, but she's gonna pick her own landing spot.
[147:49.35]Okay.
[147:49.69]No, I can, like, move it around, but she's gonna, like, drive it like a car.
[147:54.27]She really is driving it like a car.
[147:57.19]I can't believe you can do this.
[147:58.65]I know.
[147:59.18]It's ridiculous.
[148:01.98]I can't believe that the AI is smart enough to be able to do this.
[148:05.62]There's the convoy.
[148:06.28]There's the convoy.
[148:07.50]Good, good, good.
[148:09.24]Flying through the trees.
[148:10.37]Uh...
[148:12.23]I can't really, I can't really aim.
[148:17.14]I told her to kind of like fly away.
[148:19.88]We may have a similar, yep.
[148:22.44]We're having a similar problem here.
[148:24.46]I'm down.
[148:28.78]That's about what we would have expected from the situation.
[148:33.23]I had to shoot her in the back of the head.
[148:34.53]You know what I mean?
[148:35.07]Like I had to.
[148:36.87]She was gonna die anyway.
[148:37.75]We were already losing at that point.
[148:42.21]Aye, aye, aye.
[148:46.30]Double dead.
[148:48.24]Alright, let's go destroy these stupid convoys.
[148:51.18]Why are we... Good checkpoint, sister.
[148:53.96]Okay, yeah, let's go.
[148:54.74]Alright, let's do this.
[148:56.56]Here's what you need to do.
[148:59.26]Get us down there.
[149:02.47]I got some charges here.
[149:03.75]I got some remote explosives.
[149:05.63]I deleted Diana for a minute because I want to try some.
[149:08.11]I don't know how you detonate, though.
[149:10.39]What's the detonate button?
[149:13.51]Probably right-click.
[149:15.54]It's a remote detonated explosive for extra fun.
[149:18.30]Combine it with some comedic timing.
[149:19.86]They even tell you to do something funny.
[149:21.30]It would be funny about it.
[149:23.56]Proximity explosion.
[149:24.80]Are you on the right?
[149:26.46]I'm on the right side.
[149:27.78]I don't know how to blow these up.
[149:30.59]I'm going to try to bring you alongside the convoy.
[149:32.85]Okay.
[149:33.49]It's probably just right click.
[149:35.11]So we got one right here.
[149:35.95]Here we go.
[149:40.13]Oh, sorry.
[149:41.09]Got it.
[149:42.03]You also got some innocents.
[149:44.48]And we're about to go down.
[149:57.57]I did not do that.
[149:59.45]Just for reference.
[150:02.77]Turns out helicopter maybe isn't the best way to tackle this mission.
[150:07.26]I don't think I did that, though.
[150:09.06]Did you do that?
[150:09.80]I don't know.
[150:10.32]I think we were already going down.
[150:11.58]I think we already exploded.
[150:12.88]Okay, so... Why is this so...
[150:16.40]What are you doing?
[150:17.70]Why does it follow my mouse in the direction I'm looking?
[150:20.48]I don't know, but you're going to make me sick.
[150:23.54]Oh my god, please stop doing that.
[150:25.86]It's making me sick.
[150:26.92]Stop doing that.
[150:27.79]I'm going to go to the menu.
[150:31.17]Okay.
[150:32.09]I have to take this really slow with the mouse.
[150:37.25]Alright, we need to just get... You need to land this thing down there.
[150:42.45]Where's the...
[150:44.45]Where's the closest one?
[150:45.27]500 meters, this one?
[150:50.65]I like the plane a lot more than the helicopter.
[150:53.39]Yeah, definitely.
[150:56.47]There's no weight to it.
[150:57.57]So, here we go.
[151:01.53]Just be careful.
[151:05.22]Wait, are you still trying to do the thing?
[151:07.16]It doesn't matter.
[151:10.43]I'm not gonna be able to do the thing.
[151:11.91]I'm gonna drive ahead of where they're supposed to be going.
[151:15.56]Okay, I'm in danger right now.
[151:18.44]Alright, there we go.
[151:19.38]Why did it explode?
[151:20.30]What the f- Okay, we're good.
[151:21.74]Here we go.
[151:22.16]I'm gonna get it right.
[151:24.00]I'm gonna land.
[151:24.63]No, it didn't work.
[151:26.39]I just threw something else.
[151:29.91]What an entrance.
[151:30.73]I'm getting out of there.
[151:31.41]Hey, how are ya?
[151:35.35]Oh my fucking lord, just hide.
[151:49.39]Ambush Alright here comes reinforcements, what do you mean call in some reinforcements oh good Here comes the next one here it comes wait for it.
[152:12.66]Why am I throwing like a razor?
[152:13.90]Oh
[152:24.02]I need a better weapon Wow, did I really kill that guy?
[152:30.66]I'm gonna try for the Mack truck
[152:36.12]Alright, so that's it.
[152:37.26]These things are dead.
[152:39.36]Or are they?
[152:39.88]I'm not sure.
[152:40.36]This guy's having some trouble.
[152:41.12]I think we've got one of three.
[152:43.16]There's two other convoys.
[152:45.28]I wonder what happens if you drive this car.
[152:47.14]No.
[152:48.59]Let me repair it first.
[152:50.57]Also, do you see this guy?
[152:51.87]Yeah, I do.
[152:52.29]I'm hoping that when we drive, he'll be with us forever.
[152:55.29]Yeah.
[152:58.07]Okay.
[152:58.33]Do you want to be the gunner?
[152:59.95]Just move forward a little bit just to see if this is going to happen.
[153:09.95]I think it worked.
[153:11.81]We did a good job.
[153:12.77]Nice work.
[153:14.13]Good job.
[153:15.29]Everything works fine.
[153:16.11]I'll be the gunner.
[153:16.71]That sounds like a plan to me.
[153:19.17]Can I even do this?
[153:20.85]I'd like to enter.
[153:21.55]You have to do it from the inside.
[153:23.05]There we go.
[153:23.63]Okay.
[153:24.47]I'm ready.
[153:28.96]Welcome to the newest member of the roster.
[153:31.10]Oh, by the way, Diana's blinded.
[153:33.68]No, that's the guy we saved for the story mission, Nick.
[153:36.66]What the heck?
[153:38.14]What the heck?
[153:39.25]I pulled him out so we could, like, play with a different partner for a second.
[153:43.21]Oh, that's good.
[153:43.65]Plus we got this guy.
[153:44.59]Yeah.
[153:46.33]Is he still on?
[153:47.37]He's still there, yeah.
[153:48.67]Like, where?
[153:49.91]He's right here next to me.
[153:52.45]Oh, he is right there.
[153:54.08]More animated.
[153:54.88]Okay, at least he's doing a good job.
[154:01.71]Going to the one We just collected another guy wait did we I thought we did How do I get over there I just gave us a fun slow-motion book what the hell I'm kind of confused that guy just threw a flare in the air.
[154:29.42]I don't know what he was doing.
[154:30.26]I
[154:31.61]Maybe that's how they signal their, like, teammates.
[154:33.94]That's how, like, sounding the alarm.
[154:38.06]That's being eaten.
[154:39.64]What is going on at all times in this game?
[154:42.12]They were eating a car, I think.
[154:49.78]Alright.
[154:52.00]Destroy.
[154:56.24]Why am I stopping?
[154:57.18]I don't know.
[155:04.92]It's never not funny.
[155:07.62]Oh, we got a roadblock.
[155:10.24]Alright, we got through it.
[155:11.38]And convoys, 300 meters dead ahead.
[155:14.04]Oh, I'll be ready.
[155:19.95]And... Get me a little closer.
[155:23.13]Just a little closer.
[155:23.93]I hear a plane.
[155:25.77]It's Nick.
[155:26.17]Closer.
[155:26.53]And...
[155:37.24]I'm in pain.
[155:38.68]I'm dead.
[155:40.12]Are you?
[155:40.72]I'm dead inside the car.
[155:42.64]Are you?
[155:42.90]I don't know.
[155:44.25]Is that me or is that the funny guy?
[155:49.37]Where are you?
[155:50.37]I'm dead right behind you.
[155:51.83]Oh, I couldn't even find your body.
[155:56.11]How did I drop you off right here?
[156:00.83]I'm getting back in this.
[156:06.94]Okay, that one's done.
[156:10.86]There's only one more.
[156:12.28]Last one's all the way over there.
[156:13.60]We lost our friend.
[156:14.54]That's okay.
[156:15.74]No, we didn't.
[156:16.14]He's still here.
[156:18.43]Oh, there he is.
[156:20.03]I can only see his head.
[156:21.53]Like the top of his dome.
[156:24.01]What's the fastest way to get over to... What?
[156:29.55]That way.
[156:32.29]Uh, no, we finally lost him, actually.
[156:34.31]Really?
[156:34.81]Yeah, he's off.
[156:35.95]I think he ran over his head, and he's gone now.
[156:39.99]Interestingly enough.
[156:41.77]There's a cougar running sideways.
[156:46.12]Not anymore?
[156:54.04]Okay.
[156:55.50]Okay.
[156:56.58]Okay!
[156:57.64]Alright.
[157:00.11]Yeah, we're not getting out of that one.
[157:01.99]It has a push, but I don't think the push is doing anything.
[157:05.95]And we lost the machine gun.
[157:07.95]I just gave you ammo and a med kit.
[157:10.00]It's almost done.
[157:10.68]We almost got it.
[157:13.10]I've released the brakes.
[157:15.10]How did you get in there?
[157:15.94]It's okay.
[157:18.18]I got this.
[157:23.32]Can I get in?
[157:23.66]Alright, I can get in.
[157:30.05]I don't think the wheels are gonna go anywhere though.
[157:33.01]Just saying.
[157:33.51]Can you shoot something to move us around?
[157:37.61]Hi.
[157:40.37]Gotta put it in neutral.
[157:41.41]I think we lost this car.
[157:53.18]Bad guys somewhere?
[157:56.09]Yeah, there was a bad guy.
[157:57.13]ColtVIP killed.
[157:58.93]I just ran up to him and did the takedown.
[158:03.82]Put a grenade under it.
[158:04.56]Maybe it'll blow it over.
[158:05.48]I don't know.
[158:10.18]No.
[158:10.78]It's a lost cause.
[158:12.00]It's a lost cause.
[158:12.78]Just gonna have to find another way.
[158:15.89]Yeah.
[158:18.03]Wilderness Trek.
[158:19.17]Time to go camping.
[158:26.87]Is this just me, or do you start running slower after, like, 30 seconds?
[158:29.63]Yeah, you look a little weird when you're running.
[158:33.10]You look slightly strange.
[158:37.12]Maybe Nick can come pick us up from the airplane?
[158:39.66]From the airport?
[158:41.35]Be nice if he could.
[158:42.07]Alright, let's hunt.
[158:43.83]Hunt.
[158:47.67]Good job.
[158:48.29]Good hunting.
[158:51.31]I'm actually out of ammo.
[158:53.82]We need a car.
[158:55.01]It's all gone.
[158:55.91]Hey, I wanna see if I got my prey.
[159:00.95]No.
[159:03.70]There is a cougar.
[159:06.22]Behind me?
[159:07.80]Uh, yeah.
[159:10.22]Help!
[159:10.48]Okay, scared him away.
[159:12.42]I think he's coming to shoot the cougar.
[159:17.54]He was, but I killed the cougar.
[159:18.77]What the hell is this?
[159:19.35]I'm gonna help this guy.
[159:22.67]He's a brave soul.
[159:23.59]I'm going to hire him as soon as I can.
[159:25.15]I just got mustard.
[159:27.90]Who the hell is leaving mustard around?
[159:31.80]What are you doing?
[159:35.16]Who is this?
[159:37.32]He was getting attacked by the cougar.
[159:42.60]Oh.
[159:43.94]What are these strafing runs that Nick is doing in the middle of the forest?
[159:47.79]He's strafing somebody.
[159:51.23]Let's keep going.
[159:53.23]Mustard This guy's a psycho we got like a gun shop right here hunter Alright, what do you got Shovel shotgun
[160:17.81]Why is she walking away from me?
[160:18.87]Submachine gun.
[160:19.73]Rifles.
[160:20.77]I'm not going to buy one of these.
[160:22.03]Alright, can I customize this?
[160:25.17]Put it here.
[160:26.59]There's a skunk!
[160:29.29]And it's dead.
[160:30.89]Good job, Fido.
[160:32.74]Nice combat.
[160:33.30]Roll two.
[160:34.64]I just saw that.
[160:37.64]Is that a skunk?
[160:39.82]I just said that's a skunk.
[160:41.28]I didn't know if you were sure it was a skunk.
[160:43.48]It could have been another animal.
[160:44.44]Skunks are not this big, are they?
[160:46.89]I don't know.
[160:47.43]I've never seen one in real life, but there is.
[160:49.87]You've never seen a skunk in real life?
[160:52.02]I mean, maybe like in a zoo or something.
[160:55.70]Zoo.
[160:56.38]Yeah, I've seen a skunk at the zoo.
[160:59.78]There's no skunk at a zoo.
[161:01.02]I feel like that exists, though.
[161:02.32]I feel like there's a zoo where there's also a skunk.
[161:07.25]Can't they like de-pheromone or something the skunk so they don't like stank everything?
[161:12.09]No, no, there's no... Doesn't that exist?
[161:14.11]That exists, but there's no skunks at a zoo.
[161:18.39]Are you sure?
[161:19.44]I'm pretty positive on that.
[161:22.58]I don't know.
[161:23.14]That would be such a shit zoo.
[161:24.88]I mean, have you seen a skunk in real life that was alive?
[161:27.36]Yes.
[161:28.62]Where?
[161:30.04]They're all over the place around here.
[161:31.22]I've seen dead skunks on the side of the road.
[161:33.40]No, I've seen skunks walking around aimlessly at night.
[161:40.86]I want to buy a gun in this video game, Far Cry 5.
[161:45.22]Let's go!
[161:45.66]Well, which gun do you have?
[161:47.91]I want to pick a different one.
[161:49.05]I have the assault rifle.
[161:51.43]I have just the rifle, the machine gun.
[161:55.51]The assault rifle.
[161:56.23]Alright, I'm going to buy a Winchester.
[162:00.61]So you're okay in my books.
[162:06.12]Alright, let's do it.
[162:07.48]How do you, like... Ooh, you can buy it.
[162:09.00]You can buy, like, scopes and silencers.
[162:12.76]Really?
[162:15.69]Is that mocking, really?
[162:16.93]Or, like, actually interested, really?
[162:19.45]A little of both, I would say.
[162:21.45]Probably more leaning towards, like, be interested.
[162:26.21]Yeah, you go to the shop and then click on a weapon you already have with Customize.
[162:34.78]Yeah, not on this thing.
[162:36.33]This is like a default weapon.
[162:37.41]I don't really want to do this Alright, let's um, we have we've got 1600 meters We've got 1600 miles till we get to the next thing You still have to buy and shit, okay, what do you want?
[162:54.60]I'm trying to commandeer as a vehicle You can keep doing what you think I'll just pick you up
[163:01.65]Uh, how do you, like, can you, like, call in a vehicle?
[163:03.57]Can you just whip out your cell phone?
[163:05.59]No, it's not like that video game.
[163:06.81]Call the customs.
[163:10.41]Oh, there is... There's a vehicle right here.
[163:12.91]What is going on over here?
[163:13.59]There's something happening here, though.
[163:18.09]Somebody's crouching over here.
[163:21.37]Somebody's fixing an air conditioning unit over here.
[163:27.60]Um... Who is this?
[163:33.17]Who are you?
[163:34.75]Partner detected.
[163:37.89]Okay.
[163:38.25]No, no.
[163:39.09]Can you interact with this person?
[163:47.73]I'm coming.
[163:48.25]I'm just gonna steal stuff from their house.
[163:50.31]On my way.
[163:50.77]Anything in the bathroom I could take?
[163:58.00]Got enough lanterns?
[163:58.84]Holy Jesus.
[164:00.77]Well, could have gone smoother.
[164:04.73]Okay, though.
[164:07.13]Woo!
[164:10.57]Hello?
[164:12.13]Oh, hi.
[164:13.63]Don't hit the piano!
[164:14.37]Was there anything in the house?
[164:16.53]There's a lady here.
[164:17.35]There's a blue-haired lady here.
[164:18.97]A blue-haired lady.
[164:20.15]There's a lady with blue hair that you could probably talk to.
[164:23.67]Is she in TwitchCon?
[164:24.09]I don't know.
[164:27.43]She's over here somewhere.
[164:30.27]She's right over here.
[164:34.71]Come over to me.
[164:36.45]She's fixing the AC unit.
[164:38.69]Are you trying to just steal the ATV and run away?
[164:40.59]No, I'm telling you.
[164:41.85]Can you not see this lady?
[164:42.98]She's right here.
[164:44.60]No, there's no... There is no lady here.
[164:47.12]Okay.
[164:47.46]I see her.
[164:47.82]Nadine.
[164:48.16]That is a blue-haired lady.
[164:51.98]Who's... Okay.
[164:53.36]Watch out for the...
[164:57.15]Hey there.
[164:57.80]Name's Nadine.
[164:58.70]And I was hoping... She is wearing a Twitch shirt.
[165:01.24]She is.
[165:01.54]What was I saying?
[165:05.17]Right.
[165:05.96]Comics?
[165:06.18]Oh, God.
[165:06.38]Okay.
[165:06.96]It's like a... What was that?
[165:07.97]Not Dead Rising.
[165:08.41]Dying Light Quest?
[165:09.09]Mm-hmm.
[165:09.29]Where are they going?
[165:10.67]Golden Age Nostalgia.
[165:11.25]Okay.
[165:37.22]Is it close?
[165:37.92]Oh, no.
[165:38.40]Collect 12 comic books.
[165:40.24]And where are those?
[165:41.72]I don't know if I want to do that.
[165:43.76]That seems a little... Yeah.
[165:48.67]Where's the other... Where's the other marker?
[165:50.67]I do like how easy it is to switch quests, though.
[165:56.89]I just have to left-click on... Did you see that?
[166:03.90]I heard it.
[166:05.92]Uh, I believe Nick had a collision mid-air with the helicopter.
[166:10.53]And I didn't see it.
[166:11.83]Oh, well.
[166:12.37]No, but he was the winner.
[166:13.91]Like, he won.
[166:15.11]Good.
[166:15.89]The helicopter died.
[166:18.49]Um... Anyway, to switch quests, all you have to do... You don't have to, like, open a quest log.
[166:22.33]You just left-click the one you want to do, and it makes it your primary quest on the map.
[166:26.91]Oh, that's cool.
[166:29.96]We may as well finish the convoy.
[166:32.69]Might as well because we only have one left.
[166:34.44]Might as well do it.
[166:45.35]By the way, no tree has been hit yet.
[166:47.41]I have not run us into anything and I'm getting us there cleanly and smoothly.
[166:54.73]I didn't say anything.
[166:55.87]What's the plan here?
[166:56.65]How are we going to take care of this?
[166:57.83]Because we have essentially a big fat person motorcycle.
[167:01.55]Okay.
[167:02.81]So what's going to happen is I am going to Molotov cocktail them.
[167:10.23]Right.
[167:11.77]That's the whole plan.
[167:12.53]That's the plan.
[167:13.09]Okay.
[167:13.47]Well, I would do that.
[167:18.59]You didn't get them.
[167:20.91]I'm gonna die.
[167:22.79]Got him.
[167:23.37]Nice.
[167:23.61]It's okay.
[167:24.75]I'm getting off.
[167:27.01]I ran myself over with the car, I believe.
[167:30.63]Hey, pick me up.
[167:32.49]What?
[167:32.69]It's a good plan, huh?
[167:43.17]At least the loading screens are fast.
[167:45.42]This is true.
[167:48.10]You are right.
[167:57.22]Hey, look it, we're over here now.
[167:59.52]It could be worse.
[168:01.54]It could be worse, you're right.
[168:04.12]Alright, I want to test something.
[168:08.83]No, we need to get an actual vehicle this time.
[168:11.83]Okay, I have a new plan.
[168:15.05]The new plan is going to be don't get detected.
[168:17.93]Okay.
[168:19.69]And put something out in front.
[168:21.59]Yeah.
[168:22.79]I'm with you on this one.
[168:24.73]So far.
[168:25.77]The other part of the plan is find a vehicle.
[168:29.59]Can we just take her car?
[168:31.35]Does she have a car?
[168:32.15]I don't know.
[168:32.73]Probably not.
[168:33.49]Not in that junkyard.
[168:39.56]This is a road, so, I mean, just a matter of time.
[168:42.10]Alright, well, there you go.
[168:44.53]Excellent.
[168:53.76]What the fuck was that?
[168:59.30]Good job.
[169:00.18]That's the road punch to that guy.
[169:03.12]Let's go.
[169:09.66]Who are you shooting at?
[169:10.94]There's a guy like right back here.
[169:12.48]Oh.
[169:12.54]Nice work.
[169:21.45]Alright, let's do it.
[169:23.30]Can you set the marker or do I have to set all the markers?
[169:25.66]Let me see if I can.
[169:29.42]Can you see that?
[169:31.44]Oh, yeah.
[169:31.96]Good.
[169:34.00]Good!
[169:34.56]He's just always bringing people.
[169:42.91]So what do these icons mean?
[169:44.05]What does that mean on that guy's car?
[169:47.81]It means he's got prisoners in the back.
[169:50.74]Oh.
[169:51.69]That might be an issue.
[169:52.47]What?
[169:53.47]I can't get it.
[169:57.06]What else you got in mind?
[169:59.16]Watch out for the meat grinder.
[169:59.88]I'm going to get that.
[170:07.40]Nice.
[170:07.82]Alright, so are they freed or not?
[170:11.36]We have to open the back door.
[170:12.50]He's got to get the child locks on.
[170:13.86]He's getting out.
[170:16.36]Okay.
[170:17.06]There's more.
[170:20.31]I think there's a few more people here maybe than we thought.
[170:22.03]Are there?
[170:24.46]This looks like a kind of outpost almost.
[170:28.16]Nice.
[170:28.36]How do we open this?
[170:32.04]E?
[170:32.94]I didn't have an option.
[170:37.56]There's something here to blow up.
[170:39.74]Like a just cause statue.
[170:41.53]Yeah.
[170:41.99]This one right over here.
[170:43.99]Should you blow that up or should we take that?
[170:46.17]Oh.
[170:46.91]Is that drivable?
[170:48.53]If it's drivable, why not?
[170:50.46]Well, I already shot it twice, so I don't think it's going to be all that safe.
[170:55.26]Just blow it up.
[170:58.86]No, no, no.
[170:59.25]Hold on.
[171:05.31]I didn't buy this for no reason.
[171:07.87]Woo!
[171:11.35]Okay.
[171:13.94]Should stop smoking any second now, hopefully.
[171:16.32]I guess I can get in.
[171:24.13]Hold on, there's loot.
[171:27.05]This has a radio.
[171:28.12]I'm going to turn the radio off.
[171:30.66]There is a radio off.
[171:31.66]I bet there's a default setting for that, too.
[171:33.40]Nice idea.
[171:34.02]Torch the fuel tank.
[171:36.98]Okay, auto-drive.
[171:38.64]Yeah, let me just put my repair torch, like, on the flammable section.
[171:42.72]Can we put remote explosives and do the thing where we run the car in, jump out, and then detonate?
[171:47.38]I mean, we probably could do the thing.
[171:49.54]Okay.
[171:49.88]You want to do the thing?
[171:50.62]Yeah, let's just do the thing.
[171:52.10]Let's do the thing.
[171:53.97]Now, first, how do you detonate a remote explosive?
[171:56.47]Uh, right-click.
[172:00.45]Oh, goddammit.
[172:02.77]They don't stick?
[172:04.03]I thought I had it.
[172:04.73]I didn't have it equipped.
[172:06.31]They don't stick.
[172:07.19]They don't stick.
[172:09.39]Oh.
[172:10.86]No, I'm saying it's middle.
[172:11.84]Can I pick it back up?
[172:13.32]Yeah.
[172:14.60]Why come they don't stick?
[172:18.32]They're still away.
[172:20.98]Oh.
[172:22.78]Mine's on there.
[172:24.85]Will they stay?
[172:25.81]I don't know.
[172:26.35]Do you see where mine is?
[172:27.35]Tell me if it moves.
[172:27.99]Uh-huh.
[172:33.11]Is it still there?
[172:35.93]Oh, easy.
[172:37.99]Okay, they might be on here.
[172:39.27]Okay.
[172:40.35]I'm going to move.
[172:41.01]Nope, that's definitely not.
[172:42.63]No.
[172:44.01]It's like rolling through the thing.
[172:46.13]Sticky bombs apparently are an upgrade.
[172:48.92]Oh, they're an upgrade.
[172:50.28]Okay, that explains it.
[172:52.20]Well, I'm going to pick this up.
[172:53.72]Is there another one here?
[172:54.34]How far down the perk tree is that?
[172:55.66]I don't know.
[172:56.26]I have seven points.
[172:59.81]No.
[172:59.99]Oh, there we go.
[173:00.35]There we go.
[173:00.65]You have to be close enough.
[173:11.22]I'm glad I tabbed out at the perfect moment for that.
[173:17.00]What?
[173:17.20]That was a lot of work for that.
[173:20.82]What did you do?
[173:21.93]I scared the shit out of myself.
[173:24.87]I tried to throw another one.
[173:28.17]Maybe you can only have one at a time?
[173:29.81]I think you can only... I don't know.

[174:18.46]Alright, now be aware, if you press middle mouse button again, it's going to explode.
[174:22.44]Okay.
[174:22.72]It's a good somber song.
[174:33.10]I'm trying to place an elevator.
[174:36.80]So are we going to dive out and you're going to press middle mouse?
[174:38.64]We're going to dive out, yeah, but hopefully nobody shoots it off the front.
[174:42.12]God.
[174:43.52]While we're on the way.
[174:44.48]Alright, you let me know when you want me to dive.
[174:48.10]I wish that notification was a little higher up the screen.
[174:52.44]Yeah, I know, right?
[174:55.14]Don't do it.
[174:56.86]No, we're fine.
[174:57.94]You're going to, like, shoot it off the hook.
[174:59.32]I'm not going to shoot it.

[175:37.10]How did we do it?
[175:38.10]Uh, he shot everything.
[175:39.90]Oh, the plane killed him.
[175:41.58]The plane killed everybody.
[175:42.62]Good work.
[175:42.94]Oh.
[175:43.50]That's our plane.
[175:44.90]Oh, I can put him back.
[175:45.80]Let's take the other guy out.
[175:47.86]What's going on?
[175:48.88]Where's, uh... Who else is on my roster right now?
[175:54.27]Well, I gotta bring Diana back, I guess.
[175:55.71]I mean, you have to.
[176:02.09]On my way.
[176:02.71]What does that entail?
[176:04.04]Oh, she's just... She just...
[176:06.79]She's been following us the whole time.
[176:09.61]She just made it.
[176:10.69]I see.
[176:11.35]I can't turn this radio station off.
[176:16.22]Are you sure?
[176:16.78]I'm trying to.
[176:17.92]Alright, so now where to?
[176:24.54]Well, we gotta find something else to do with our lives.
[176:28.33]I don't think I died.
[176:30.88]Let's go to the map and see.
[176:32.02]Liberate the cult outpost.
[176:34.36]We can talk to Windell.
[176:36.28]We can talk to Pastor Jerome.
[176:38.26]We can go to the plane.
[176:40.82]Hmm.
[176:42.18]Or we can go to a completely different section of the map.
[176:45.34]Or we can do Ride the Zipline.
[176:47.28]There was a quest called Ride the Zipline.
[176:50.42]Where was that one?
[176:51.94]I just marked it.
[176:56.10]Yeah.
[176:56.72]Might as well.
[176:58.70]Hi, guys.
[177:06.09]Alright.
[177:07.17]Who is yelling?
[177:07.99]Her.
[177:08.53]No way.
[177:10.40]Was it?
[177:10.80]Yeah.
[177:16.87]She's lost her fucking goddamn mind.
[177:25.43]She's on the gunner, and she's freaking the fuck up.
[177:29.39]I can't take it.
[177:30.17]I can't take it.
[177:32.89]She's doing the He-Man scream.
[177:37.31]Oh, my God.
[177:37.93]She is on the gunner.
[177:38.99]I'll get us there.
[177:50.00]I need a gun that's not quite as precision-oriented.
[177:54.94]How do you unlock the second unlock the weapon slot with the perk holster?
[178:00.70]Who's that guy?
[178:03.89]He had a skull on his name.
[178:05.63]Whoever it was.
[178:06.21]Got that guy.
[178:10.81]Wow.
[178:12.15]You knocked him under the other car.
[178:16.12]That's a guy hunting a moose.
[178:20.02]That's a good scream.
[178:21.50]Oh my god.
[178:25.02]Relax.
[178:28.90]She said she has a headache.
[178:29.86]She screamed so loud she gave herself a headache.
[178:32.28]She said I have a headache?
[178:33.54]Yeah.
[178:36.34]Stop exerting so much force.
[178:38.36]I'm gonna look at my perks while you're driving.
[178:40.02]I'm gonna try to find one that looks useful.
[178:45.96]Oh, come on.
[178:46.84]Really?
[178:47.22]You just blew that whole thing.
[178:50.38]Not you.
[178:52.76]The animal's in the road.
[178:58.32]Throwback incoming... Oh, yeah.
[179:05.48]Carry up to five medkits.
[179:06.90]That seems good.
[179:13.46]Alright, so ride the zipline.
[179:15.18]It's up here.
[179:15.66]Alright.
[179:22.73]Are we just to get up in the silo here?
[179:28.26]Guess I'm still looking at my perks.
[179:31.60]I was trying to find how you get another holster slot But I don't see a way to do that more mustard Well we have to do that how do I do the one that gives us more hit points This one gives you a hundred and fifty percent max HP This guy's not paying attention so
[179:56.94]I think I'll be able to get this guy.
[179:58.54]What are we doing?
[180:00.00]Where am I?
[180:00.52]Alright, well, he's dead.
[180:03.64]Are we sneaking?
[180:05.04]I mean, I... Why is the building on fire?
[180:07.14]The guy just torched the building, I think.
[180:08.98]I don't know what he was doing.
[180:09.84]I think I'm being investigated.
[180:16.52]Oh.
[180:28.02]Watch out, I don't want to burn.
[180:30.52]How did you get knocked?
[180:31.42]I don't know.
[180:33.60]Like, shoulder charged you.
[180:34.80]Here comes another one.
[180:37.70]Easy.
[180:43.72]Why would you dive out of the car?
[180:45.76]I think he died.
[180:46.87]He died out of the car.
[180:48.43]Oh, did he?
[180:48.83]How are we supposed to get up here?
[180:53.25]Oh, from here maybe?
[180:58.57]Yeah, the zip line takes us.
[180:59.89]Do me a favor.
[181:00.81]What?
[181:01.93]Go stand over here.
[181:03.77]Oh, that's not you.
[181:04.41]That's Diana.
[181:05.23]Yeah, Diana's up there.
[181:08.67]Do you want me to come over there?
[181:09.97]Hold on.
[181:10.19]What are you guys up to over there?
[181:18.34]Negative.
[181:19.22]No can do.
[181:20.84]Don't argue with me, Diana.
[181:22.20]You trying to get her to get inside the car?
[181:24.44]No.
[181:26.10]No?
[181:33.52]She gets scared every time you open it.
[181:35.28]She gets scared.
[181:37.02]I want to see what would happen.
[181:39.54]Will she follow you in there if you walk in there?
[181:41.23]Holding position.
[181:42.27]I want to see if I could, like, hit her with the metal thing.
[181:46.83]Oh, I see what you're talking about.
[181:48.65]Also, I can't get in this anyway.
[181:56.22]There you go.
[182:01.88]You having fun up there?
[182:03.42]I'm just watching with my binoculars.
[182:11.28]You look like you're having a lot of fun.
[182:17.79]What?
[182:19.58]What just happened?
[182:20.36]I don't know.
[182:20.78]You closed the doors and... The whole car did a 180.
[182:28.64]Somebody has this on string.
[182:31.04]This is not looking like it's supposed to be happening.
[182:33.40]Somebody has this on a string and it's ripping it around.
[182:37.90]She looks like she's going to be in a lot of trouble in about five seconds.
[182:40.86]The car is stationary on mine.
[182:42.91]This car is freaking out on my screen.
[182:47.59]Yeah, it's doing the GTA swing set.
[182:50.57]I feel like I should watch this for at least another minute or two.
[182:52.35]Okay.
[182:54.61]What the fuck?
[182:55.83]Ow.
[182:56.77]Who just shot me?
[182:59.50]Who just shot me?
[183:00.18]Somebody shot me.
[183:05.48]What was that?
[183:06.04]I have no idea.
[183:07.64]I got sniped.
[183:11.78]There's an eagle.
[183:12.92]What do you mean there's an eagle?
[183:14.18]There's an actual eagle.
[183:15.30]There's an actual... What do you mean there's an actual...
[183:21.76]Nice parachute.
[183:24.60]What?
[183:25.14]That's probably what hit you.
[183:26.68]You were looking in binoculars and you were being birds of prey.
[183:29.84]Yeah, I got eagled.
[183:30.54]Okay.
[183:32.51]Well, okay.
[183:33.43]That's fine.
[183:33.83]Apparently the eagle is hostile and evil.
[183:37.33]Apparently.
[183:37.93]I don't know how they feel in Montana about shooting.
[183:42.79]I kind of didn't want to watch.
[183:49.96]It's more fun to watch.
[183:56.71]What is she shooting?
[183:57.81]Did she just kill the eagle?
[183:59.23]She just killed the ball.
[184:00.65]She just shot straight in the ear.
[184:02.93]It's dead.
[184:03.75]No, yeah, it's gone.
[184:06.83]She didn't even look.
[184:08.31]She just shot straight in the ear.
[184:10.23]She did that without even trying.
[184:13.68]Holy God.
[184:14.74]Yeah.
[184:17.18]No.
[184:19.68]Wow.
[184:22.22]That was pretty remarkable.
[184:25.46]Yeah, go do the thing.
[184:32.61]Blow it up.
[184:33.95]It won't blow up.
[184:35.39]Let me help you.
[184:35.95]It looks like it's about to.
[184:37.99]It's got holes all over it.
[184:40.00]There's fire everywhere.
[184:41.24]That's not far enough.
[184:52.56]That's not even close, no.
[184:59.16]Okay.
[185:03.15]She needs to get out of the way.
[185:06.90]This is going to blow her up, too.
[185:07.90]No, wait a minute.
[185:11.52]These are... Okay.
[185:16.48]They were proximity mines.
[185:18.82]I'm fine.
[185:19.94]How was that not supposed to go that way?
[185:21.82]You were supposed to be dead.
[185:22.80]It was supposed to be real funny.
[185:26.82]I mean, I... That was a pretty funny comedy moment, I think.
[185:29.88]Alright, we need to get up there.
[185:34.96]Okay.
[185:37.16]Have you tried to go up there?
[185:38.46]I mean, you can zipline from there, but I don't think that does anything.
[185:42.26]I don't think you can climb from here.
[185:48.75]You go in.
[185:49.73]What do you mean, I go in?
[185:55.48]Why am I in here?
[185:56.86]Is there a snake in here?
[186:02.90]It is a snake.
[186:03.78]What?
[186:04.33]Why is there?
[186:10.21]There wasn't a snake in here last time.
[186:13.19]Are you sure?
[186:13.89]I'm pretty sure about that.
[186:14.97]I was already in here.
[186:19.27]Got him.
[186:21.61]Alright.
[186:23.87]We need to find a way to get up there.
[186:26.13]I was already in that building.
[186:27.19]There was no snake in there before.
[186:28.41]Uh-huh.
[186:32.23]You being a meme streamer?
[186:33.77]I don't... Why?
[186:34.69]Because I didn't know there was a snake on the ground?
[186:36.33]Yeah, you can't... I gotta... Yeah, we gotta go from over here.
[186:43.29]Looks like there's another zipline this way.
[186:44.63]I mean, there's very clearly, like, a platform.
[186:50.65]Yeah, we just gotta go from here.
[186:54.28]Fake reaction.
[187:00.12]Hurrah!
[187:01.86]Oh, I see.
[187:02.34]There's a bear.
[187:04.02]I don't know where he is.
[187:05.24]Watch me scream at the bear, guys.
[187:06.46]I'm going to scream.
[187:07.16]See?
[187:07.94]I didn't scream this time.
[187:10.92]Oh, God, no.
[187:11.82]Don't even.
[187:12.30]Please.
[187:13.70]Seriously.
[187:15.73]Okay, that's fine.
[187:16.63]I'm good with that.
[187:21.49]Where's the initial climb up?
[187:22.87]Oh, God.
[187:23.53]It's, like, way over here.
[187:26.81]Really?
[187:27.19]Like, I can't even see where the point is.
[187:31.70]Fuck, it's so far away, you're right.
[187:37.10]Boring streamer.
[187:37.98]He had no reaction to that.
[187:45.33]I love watching from behind this.
[187:47.31]Run animation up in 90 degrees.
[187:50.49]What are you doing?
[187:51.03]Why would you just throw that in the air like that?
[187:56.65]Why would you?
[187:57.93]I didn't.
[187:58.23]Question me.
[187:59.89]Did you pick it up?
[188:01.25]Yeah.
[188:02.48]I caught it in the air.
[188:03.32]Nice job.
[188:06.62]There's even more to go through here.
[188:09.18]There's more, yeah.
[188:10.32]No, we definitely should have been on ATV for this.
[188:13.02]We would have been going by so much faster.
[188:15.50]Well, I think we're almost there.
[188:16.41]Yeah, this is a ropes course.
[188:18.43]Alright, let's play cool.
[188:22.15]Play cool.
[188:23.85]Mm-hmm.
[188:28.23]What is this guy?
[188:30.93]He's like a priest.
[188:31.89]He's like a zombie priest.
[188:34.41]Is she going to take him out?
[188:37.59]Yeah.
[188:38.77]Nice work.
[188:41.35]Can we take that guy's magic staff?
[188:45.81]No.
[188:47.50]That would be a good melee weapon.
[188:54.10]He's killed a warlock.
[188:56.40]We should be happy about that.
[189:01.50]There's the helicopter.
[189:03.76]Other bad guys.
[189:07.68]Alright, so which way we slide in here?
[189:09.36]From here?
[189:09.66]There's actually a bunch of cultists down here.
[189:12.96]Oops.
[189:16.18]Sorry, dog.
[189:16.84]I'm sorry, dog.
[189:20.30]Where did this guy come from?
[189:21.72]I took... I hit...
[189:27.83]I hit the takedown button.
[189:29.13]I hit the takedown button, and she took down me.
[189:31.47]Not fair.
[189:35.33]That was on her screen.
[189:36.35]Alright, we're using the zipline, right?
[189:39.81]Sorry.
[189:42.53]So, this is the only one that takes us out of here?
[189:48.12]Don't fall.
[189:48.92]Is there a trick?
[189:49.80]Like, as long as you don't push space, then... I don't think there's a trick.
[189:59.54]Alright, away we go.
[190:00.44]This is the payoff.
[190:01.50]This is the fun part.
[190:05.90]Oh boy.
[190:07.30]Oh my fucking god.
[190:08.58]You hit space.
[190:11.79]Just beat the fucking thing for me.
[190:13.33]There's an eagle up here.
[190:17.73]also a wolf by the looks of things are you dead I just I just did it because I I thought because I thought there was going to be a platform I didn't know we were going to go right from zipline to zipline so I was holding space to grab on and then I just said I don't give a fuck and I did the parachute and then I just cut the rope and did it thank god Diane is a better gamer than I am hi
[190:46.31]Did you even need to let go?
[190:47.37]Did you just have to press the button?
[190:50.59]The game just played for you.
[190:51.69]I thought I had to press the button again because we fell off one onto another.
[190:56.21]Don't worry, we're fine.
[191:05.03]I'll just finish the commission.
[191:06.45]Everything's gonna be fine.
[191:11.70]I was under the impression that we had to hit space again when we were on... whatever.
[191:16.93]Just complete this.
[191:17.69]Alright, I'm rolling.
[191:26.59]Watch my back.
[191:27.67]There's a lot of stuff up here.
[191:29.23]Congratulations.
[191:30.01]High attention.
[191:32.03]There's an armor vest.
[191:35.05]There's a whole stack of cash.
[191:37.87]Nice.
[191:39.08]Like $2,000.
[191:39.24]A grenade.
[191:39.76]And a hot dog.
[191:55.89]Go back up.
[191:56.65]I'm not going back up.
[191:59.31]He deprived chat of the great finale.
[192:02.93]Can you ride a cow?
[192:04.27]That'd be funny.
[192:07.71]How do people get back?
[192:08.43]Didn't we just clear this area?
[192:09.63]I thought so.
[192:17.84]Another flamethrower guy.
[192:23.08]And a meat grinder.
[192:26.04]That guy disintegrated.
[192:26.94]Alright.
[192:32.29]Where did all this come from?
[192:33.59]I don't know.
[192:33.99]They just kind of appeared.
[192:37.15]Is it a helicopter too?
[192:39.91]They called it air support.
[192:46.30]There we go.
[192:46.72]See ya.
[192:50.62]Here comes more.
[192:55.90]It's almost like the AI director decided to spawn a bunch of monsters on us.
[193:00.12]Yeah.
[193:01.22]Yeah, this is just like a battlefield moment simulator.
[193:04.04]Alright, there's currently a skull coming.
[193:07.04]Hold on, we need to take care of this.
[193:20.97]Why do they always roll out of the car?
[193:23.09]I don't know.
[193:23.53]No matter how they're killed, they roll outside.
[193:25.21]I don't know why that guy had a skull for some reason.
[193:32.56]Alright, well, this guy's got something.
[193:38.36]Take a flower.
[193:39.66]Take some weed, apparently.
[193:43.26]He's gonna give us a side quest.
[193:45.23]Is this a sponsored stream?
[193:46.61]No, it is not.
[193:47.53]It's just one of those regular streams.
[193:56.37]Oh, I just kicked those guys off for no reason.
[194:06.12]Alright, so what do you want to do?
[194:11.70]Let's go do the... Let's go to the pumpkin farm.
[194:16.00]There's kind of like a lot of things.
[194:17.50]The pump... See, this is another character quest.
[194:23.43]Hmm...
[194:24.74]Okay.
[194:25.52]This is like, remember the one, the other one we did with the plane?
[194:30.42]Yeah, yeah.
[194:31.08]Alright, so, uh, I'm gonna grab a glass of water.
[194:34.05]Okay.
[194:34.67]So, you, you just, you just, you just drive it.
[194:38.27]And I'm gonna be in the backseat while I get some water.
[194:41.27]I'll be right back.
[194:43.23]Don't even need to say be right back.
[194:44.41]I'm not even gonna mute.
[194:45.61]Just give me fucking water, you know?
[194:46.89]What's the deal?
[194:47.35]It's brave.
[194:47.93]It's very brave.
[194:50.83]Not even gonna mute, guys.
[194:52.15]He's not, he doesn't even care what you hear.
[195:02.56]I gotta save that girl.
[195:03.40]It's very important.
[195:05.86]I don't know how that happened.
[195:14.45]Where can I like, where can I like drop him off where he wouldn't know?
[195:17.59]Where can I drop him off when he comes back?
[195:32.87]I gotta hurry.
[195:34.13]Water isn't much time.
[195:35.61]Also, I can't go higher up this hill.
[195:50.92]I think I can do, like, a wingsuit from here.
[195:53.86]Sorry, Jermis Chat.
[195:54.60]You're gonna be stuck staring at a tree.
[195:56.46]You're gonna like it.
[196:01.12]You're gonna really enjoy that tree, OK?
[196:23.31]Got a new partner.
[196:45.13]What, do you think I'm a slash follow?
[196:47.69]You think we're playing World of Warcraft and you can just slash follow me through the dailies?
[196:51.33]Shh, shh, he's coming.
[196:58.04]I have a really, really important question for you.
[197:02.02]How did I get in this car?
[197:05.42]How did you get in the car?
[197:06.45]How did I get in this car?
[197:07.33]Weren't we in an ATV?
[197:08.51]Huh?
[197:14.25]I don't know.
[197:14.76]That's a great question.
[197:15.92]What happened?
[197:18.42]I think I just did a magic trick.
[197:22.46]I don't understand what happened.
[197:27.96]What?
[197:29.50]That backfired so spectacularly.
[197:31.92]I don't understand.
[197:33.37]I'm so confused.
[197:39.76]That was a good magic trick you just did.
[197:42.10]Me?
[197:42.42]Yeah, it was a good magic trick.
[197:44.50]Oh, well, we got a dog in a cage here.
[197:47.70]I tried to lead you up on a hill.
[197:50.93]And you got too far away, so it teleported you into my backseat.
[197:54.75]So I drove you all the way here anyway.
[197:56.47]I didn't know you were there.
[197:58.53]And so you came back and said, why am I in this car?
[198:01.67]And I looked back, and there you are.
[198:03.27]Oh, that's so dumb.
[198:06.47]Where's this last guy?
[198:07.69]He's right.
[198:08.17]I freed the dog.
[198:11.48]Pet Boomer is the new mission.
[198:15.26]Pet.
[198:16.78]How do you pet?
[198:19.93]Pet Boomer.
[198:21.27]Too much attention.
[198:23.69]Pet him.
[198:25.59]He's going to go eat the human.
[198:27.11]Oh, he's so cute.
[198:30.74]What a good dog.
[198:31.94]What a good dog.
[198:34.16]You pet him.
[198:35.12]Can I?
[198:35.42]Get the first person lick.
[198:36.52]I don't think I can.
[198:40.70]Go talk.
[198:41.14]Go look at his face.
[198:42.44]I can't.
[198:42.90]Oh, there you go.
[198:43.32]Now I can.
[198:45.76]Oh, he's so cute.
[198:46.62]I know.
[198:47.64]He's adorable.
[198:51.74]There's people that want to kill him.
[198:53.18]He's hell-bent on going over here.
[198:56.39]What is he doing?
[198:56.91]I gave him a new target.
[198:58.23]Oh, it's a companion.
[198:59.99]He's a companion, yeah.
[199:05.39]Well, I don't think he's our companion yet.
[199:07.58]Not yet.
[199:08.08]I have to kick out Diana first.
[199:12.50]Oh, I see.
[199:14.98]Diana.
[199:15.50]I don't know what Diana's doing.
[199:19.73]She's going to be depressed and leave.
[199:24.21]Bye, Diana.
[199:26.77]Or indecisively.
[199:30.19]I think she's just going to be an NPC and walk around in circles.
[199:32.52]No, there she goes.
[199:34.55]You were great companion while you lasted.
[199:40.22]Godspeed.
[199:44.32]No, she's coming back.
[199:48.49]And we're back.
[199:50.91]Diana, you were the best.
[199:53.67]You were potentially the greatest.
[199:58.78]There she goes.
[199:59.44]She's on her path.
[200:00.24]Bye-bye.
[200:00.62]She'll find her way.
[200:01.52]She'll find the correct path.
[200:03.74]Oh, my Lord.
[200:06.40]Well, that companion quest was a lot simpler than the other one.
[200:10.66]Alright, what else we got?
[200:14.58]We got a prisoner van.
[200:16.10]We've got... Do you want to do, like, a quest, or do you want to go look for another, like, interesting place?
[200:23.64]Let's do, like, another mission, like a story mission.
[200:26.55]Like a mission mission.
[200:27.93]We haven't done a story mission in a while.
[200:31.47]There's, like, four or five to choose from.
[200:37.20]I'll pick that one.
[200:40.60]I'm just taking loot.
[200:42.66]Did you say I'm just... Oh.
[200:45.88]Looting people.
[200:51.10]You know, we got cars over here, you know?
[200:55.32]Like, why am I running?
[200:56.24]Yeah, you keep running there.
[200:57.40]You could get in the car and pick me up.
[200:59.70]I could, but I don't know.
[201:01.00]What is this?
[201:01.78]There's something, like an interest point here.
[201:05.47]Is there?
[201:07.19]shop buy and customize atvs cars and trucks I don't think we have enough money for that maybe I do since these are cheap are they cheaper than the guns I mean not really I like that all of the all the default NPC ones are available too
[201:35.34]Yeah, for like $1,000.
[201:35.94]Why would you buy them?
[201:38.16]I'm assuming that's only a lot of money at this stage in the game, though.
[201:41.92]Maybe, yeah.
[201:45.40]Oh, there's like the mystery machine.
[201:46.68]There's so many cars.
[201:51.12]You can buy a tractor.
[201:55.30]What do I get for grenades?
[201:56.26]I get smoke grenades.
[201:58.32]Eh, buy a couple more grenades.
[201:59.46]Why not?
[202:01.12]What about perks?
[202:01.66]How am I doing?
[202:02.02]Wingsuit?
[202:05.62]Oh, unfortunately not yet.
[202:09.36]Dude, I'm kind of deciding between the buggy and the Mad Max car.
[202:18.21]You're actually going to buy one?
[202:20.49]Yeah.
[202:21.15]I have 5,000 bucks.
[202:22.57]Why not just have some fun, you know?
[202:24.39]Spend some money.
[202:26.07]I guess you're right.
[202:28.03]Get something fun.
[202:29.38]What are we saving up for, you know?
[202:30.62]Retirement?
[202:33.30]No.
[202:37.36]Do you want the... Oops.
[202:40.04]Do you want one that has a gun on top or just do a regular one because that's too overpowered?
[202:44.83]Whatever one you want to do.
[202:45.67]I would say do the one that's more fun.
[202:50.63]Define fun.
[202:53.03]Up against the world.
[202:55.45]Something not easy.
[202:56.13]Yeah, just keep looking.
[202:58.55]It should be there somewhere.
[203:14.45]I die on my own terms!
[203:15.75]Where did the cat go?
[203:17.01]Wait, the dog's coming to get you!
[203:18.81]Get him!
[203:19.51]Oh, yeah.
[203:20.09]Oh, what a good boy.
[203:21.01]My one true friend.
[203:24.33]Did the cat disappear?
[203:25.39]Where'd the cat go?
[203:27.73]I'm pretty sure I launched the first cat in outer space.
[203:30.41]You should have seen it.
[203:33.85]When you were looking at the menu, it was just, like, stalking you.
[203:36.64]Was it?
[203:36.86]It was sneaking up on you.
[203:37.74]Why was it attacking me and not you, though?
[203:39.94]I was in the building.
[203:42.08]Why would it even come over here?
[203:45.29]He was just waiting for me and then grabbed me.
[203:50.31]Alright, hang on.
[203:54.19]Oh, there's the cat.
[203:55.39]Okay.
[204:00.93]I'm telling you, there's an AI director.
[204:02.44]That was just a smoker.
[204:05.06]It's spawning special infected on us.
[204:07.54]Because we're taking too long.
[204:12.42]It's a hunter.
[204:21.68]See?
[204:23.16]Okay, I guess the people have spoken.
[204:24.98]They want the one with the gun.
[204:27.00]So here you go.
[204:28.68]The one with the gun?
[204:32.10]I just bought it.
[204:35.73]Not to rush you or anything, but the helicopter right next to us, that is very, very much not friendly.
[204:42.25]Okay.
[204:44.11]Those car colors suck.
[204:48.42]How do I use it?
[204:49.36]Oh, I can just click drive from the garage.
[204:51.56]Oh, cool.
[204:53.11]Are you gonna appear in the garage?
[204:58.27]Vehicle delivery in progress.
[205:00.97]Here it is.
[205:02.33]This is my new ride.
[205:04.82]There's two machine guns on it?
[205:06.04]Yeah.
[205:08.82]How do I... Do I have to do it a certain way?
[205:13.58]Or do you shoot it from in here?
[205:16.95]Oh.
[205:17.35]Oh.
[205:19.07]Well, that works.
[205:20.80]You don't even need me anymore.
[205:22.30]How do I aim it?
[205:23.66]Oh!
[205:27.60]Did you do that?
[205:29.14]I did not.
[205:30.14]Or did the helicopter pull up my brand new car that I just spent all of my money on?
[205:42.81]I hope I hope it's gone.
[205:44.37]I hope your money's gone, too.
[205:46.11]There's no way there's no way It's definitely something you can just call in Where's the garage?
[205:55.49]Why are we not at the garage where we just were a minute ago?
[205:59.97]Wasn't the ground?
[206:00.57]Oh, it's right here.
[206:01.17]Yeah, it's right over here So how much money do you have?
[206:07.37]I have no money.
[206:08.73]You got no money.
[206:09.49]But I think I can just spawn the vehicle in as long as it's at a garage.
[206:14.08]Can you?
[206:16.08]Look at that.
[206:19.40]Perfect.
[206:22.95]How do you aim?
[206:24.95]Maybe you can't.
[206:30.05]So just shoot directly ahead and that's it?
[206:31.75]I think it just shoots right in front of you.
[206:33.65]Okay.
[206:34.89]I guess that stops it from being, like, completely overpowered.
[206:39.00]It's like Twisted Metal.
[206:40.10]It's got to be going the right way.
[206:42.78]Well, I just saved that guy.
[206:44.76]How did you not shoot that guy?
[206:47.39]Precision.
[206:49.39]Go get his quest.
[206:50.53]Go get his quest.
[206:51.53]That breed is real friendly and real loyal.
[206:56.08]Yeah, do you have something else you'd rather do?
[206:57.96]This guy doesn't have a quest.
[207:00.62]Maybe I'm the only one that can get them because it's my video game.
[207:03.30]He was just eating this person.
[207:07.04]He's just looking for loot.
[207:09.70]He just got $25.
[207:10.20]Oh.
[207:10.44]Let's go get the prepper stash.
[207:16.57]Let's do fishing.
[207:17.25]Can we just do fishing for like a minute and a half?
[207:20.45]Do you really want to go fishing?
[207:21.82]Yeah, I really want to just... That was mean.
[207:25.09]I was trying to... Alright, let's go.
[207:28.01]Do we even have a fishing rod?
[207:30.87]I think we have to unlock it.
[207:32.25]I think it's a perk.
[207:33.89]We didn't even destroy the silo.
[207:37.29]It's right there.
[207:37.95]Hang on.
[207:41.06]Oh.
[207:42.82]Oh.
[207:46.08]He's alright.
[207:46.86]He's okay.
[207:47.12]He's fine.
[207:48.74]He's fine.
[207:55.75]There you go.
[207:56.29]Silo destroyed.
[208:02.31]Alright.
[208:02.81]Will you let me in?
[208:04.91]This is my car.
[208:06.55]Yeah, I know.
[208:07.09]Look at that U-turn.
[208:08.01]I can't get in.
[208:08.51]Look at that U-turn.
[208:10.49]Yeah, it's really nice, and I'd like to get in it.
[208:12.19]Watch this.
[208:14.25]What if it has a handbrake?
[208:19.26]Alright, here.
[208:19.88]Let me in.
[208:21.54]Alright, let's move.
[208:26.79]Where are we going?
[208:27.31]Does the dog get in?
[208:29.73]I don't think so.
[208:31.61]Yeah, maybe... Well, the dog doesn't get in if you run the dog over.
[208:36.37]I'm just trying to get an angle to shoot.
[208:40.62]I think you're in his seat.
[208:41.96]Like, he's supposed to be shotgun with me.
[208:44.06]Let me see what happens so I can know.
[208:48.22]Will he join you?
[208:48.80]Any of your reinforcements are on the way?
[208:58.70]Come on.
[208:59.44]Come on, boy.
[209:00.18]He's going to run after the car.
[209:01.80]He's going to run after the car.
[209:02.68]Okay.
[209:04.56]Where do you want to go?
[209:08.30]Let's go to... Let me see my map.
[209:13.00]Don't kill us.
[209:15.28]Let's go to the... That's a big apple.
[209:19.50]That's a large apple.
[209:22.07]Fall's End?
[209:24.88]Down here?
[209:25.26]That's kind of far away.
[209:26.40]What about this one?
[209:27.18]We got this guy right here.
[209:28.98]Let's do this one.
[209:31.34]Look, that guy's right there.
[209:33.28]Do this one.
[209:35.30]Oh, the prepper stash?
[209:36.16]Yeah, the one with the... Yeah.
[209:40.00]That's where the fishing spot is.
[209:41.26]Maybe we can buy a fishing rod from the guy down there.
[209:43.79]Maybe.
[209:44.75]It's possible.
[209:45.71]I just want to see it.
[209:47.97]Why?
[209:48.25]Yeah, that was a good dodge.
[209:52.57]You're slippery.
[209:58.93]What?
[209:59.11]That was an innocent?
[209:59.91]Oh, you're killing innocents.
[210:02.07]Oh, I forgot that was the other type of car.
[210:04.73]Where are you off to?
[210:07.81]I'm following your waypoint.
[210:11.35]Are you?
[210:14.51]Yeah, we gotta cross the bridge.
[210:16.05]Why did it go... It's not on the screen anymore.
[210:19.15]The quest mark is not there anymore.
[210:24.45]Wait, where are you going?
[210:26.27]I'm just following the markers.
[210:29.68]Doesn't look like you're following the marker.
[210:36.44]Oh, you're going to the pepper stash.
[210:38.78]Oh.
[210:39.50]That's where my marker is.
[210:40.78]Well, that's fine.
[210:44.50]That works.
[210:44.88]I guess it's... Is it up high or down low?
[210:51.41]It looks higher up.
[210:53.83]But this is where the, this is where GPS, this is where Google Maps is taking me, okay?
[210:57.37]Is there a train?
[211:00.04]Is there a train?
[211:01.28]Looks like there's a track.
[211:04.54]Uh, I seem to be on the wrong side of the water.
[211:12.25]Why is it trying to force me back on the road?
[211:15.43]Okay, maybe you have to go over a certain bridge or something?
[211:20.19]Am I even in the car?
[211:22.57]No, I'm not.
[211:23.97]I'm just realizing this now.
[211:29.43]What is exploding?
[211:30.39]Is that you?
[211:31.11]No.
[211:33.49]I am not trying to blow the car up.
[211:36.24]I am not doing this.
[211:41.24]I think it's that guy.
[211:42.06]It's this guy right here.
[211:50.79]He was shooting grenades or something at us.
[211:52.43]What's that?
[212:07.39]What is he doing?
[212:08.89]Talk to me.
[212:10.01]Me?
[212:10.87]No, this guy.
[212:11.70]He has like a talk button with like a thing on his head.
[212:14.02]What are you shooting?
[212:15.30]Guy down here.
[212:15.84]This guy?
[212:18.30]Got him.
[212:20.95]Got it!
[212:22.85]Watch out, don't step on the gas.
[212:29.10]You can hire him, we already have a companion.
[212:30.50]Alright.
[212:38.36]You ready?
[212:39.34]I am getting in the car and I'm gonna stay in it.
[212:44.60]God.
[212:45.54]Why?
[212:45.98]This is like... I want ice.
[212:52.45]We're driving so strangely.
[212:53.47]Why are we driving like this?
[212:54.51]And why is there just an elk in the middle of the road?
[212:56.68]Oh, no.
[212:57.08]That's... That is an elk.
[212:59.94]It's an elk, yeah.
[213:01.66]What is this doing here?
[213:02.50]Why would this be here?
[213:03.84]I don't know.
[213:05.52]He's got something to say, though.
[213:08.54]That's a moose.
[213:13.41]We got word in from patrol that they saw a civilian hiding around the saloon.
[213:17.37]When I went to look, I found an empty room full of needles.
[213:19.49]They're all elks.
[213:20.23]It looked like someone had been experimented.
[213:22.72]It does the same thing.
[213:24.06]Basically the same thing.
[213:26.76]Okay, now where was I?
[213:31.89]Straight ahead.
[213:39.29]You just drove so... Oh, there's bad guys.
[213:45.93]Yeah, there are.
[213:49.38]Isn't this where we're supposed to be though?
[213:51.48]Yeah, I guess we are.
[213:54.50]This is it.
[213:55.00]I don't know how we got over here.
[213:57.34]As me and my buddies raided some supplies, we hid the gear in the bridge supports.
[214:03.74]You'll need a grappling hook to get to it.
[214:11.56]Like here?
[214:12.88]Look at this grapple.
[214:15.34]I guess I'm grappling from here?
[214:25.95]Where- Oh, are you dead?
[214:28.44]Yes.
[214:31.62]Why would that- No, why did you- Alright.
[214:35.02]Fuck this.
[214:36.08]How did you survive and how did I die?
[214:37.90]I only jumped from- Cause I only jumped from like- From where?
[214:40.76]This step up.
[214:41.52]Right here.
[214:43.07]This one.
[214:43.83]I jumped from this one.
[214:45.67]No fucking way.
[214:48.79]Which one did you jump from?
[214:51.27]I grappled!
[214:52.13]Alright, what are we looking for?
[215:00.55]Another stash?
[215:01.75]We're looking for a stash you can only access with a grappling hook.
[215:05.13]I got- I grap- Come up here.
[215:07.91]I found it.
[215:09.59]How do you do this?
[215:10.99]What's the- what's the game plan?
[215:14.99]Do I jump and swing?
[215:21.31]It's that guy versus the cougar.
[215:23.15]The gun shop versus the cougar.
[215:25.21]Look out, here it comes!
[215:26.60]I think he's losing.
[215:30.30]Yep, he's dead.
[215:30.90]Yeah, he lost.
[215:33.80]Here it comes!
[215:35.70]Is he dead?
[215:37.81]I don't know if he's dead.
[215:38.85]Yeah, he is.
[215:41.07]Okay.
[215:42.45]Go for it.
[215:47.97]Oh, I see.
[215:48.96]Um...
[215:51.54]Can we smash into each other or something?
[215:53.08]I'm scared of this.
[215:58.30]Now we're talking.
[215:59.86]Just swing and jump?
[216:01.54]No, you don't jump.
[216:02.22]You just swing until you can grapple onto the next one.
[216:07.96]Uh-huh.
[216:09.99]And you're supposed to land in that middle spot, I guess?
[216:14.09]Up there?
[216:14.91]Ooh, I see.
[216:15.59]Up there.
[216:15.99]Okay.
[216:19.51]Oh, no!
[216:19.95]Did you fall?
[216:21.05]I'm down.
[216:21.61]Yeah, but I think I ran into you.
[216:24.85]Oh, no.
[216:25.09]I got a chance here.
[216:25.75]Hold on.
[216:30.01]I was in the final swing, too.
[216:34.54]Why is there... There's a bad guy up here now.
[216:40.66]Why didn't I not jump?
[216:42.10]You spaced the jump, right?
[216:44.04]Maybe it's C. What?
[216:45.66]What?
[216:50.07]Why did I open my parachute?
[216:51.18]Okay, I'm good.
[216:51.66]I made it.
[216:52.94]Now what?
[216:57.20]I don't know.
[216:57.52]I'm killing the bad guys that got here somehow.
[217:04.27]Okay, well.
[217:24.14]Got him.
[217:25.98]Went a lot smoother once.
[217:27.07]I kind of knew what to look for.
[217:30.87]Boomer.
[217:31.29]Alright.
[217:31.59]So now that we're both up here, where do you want to go from here?
[217:35.55]We got to keep going.
[217:37.55]Just keep it moving.
[217:46.53]Oof.
[217:48.13]Oof.
[217:49.57]Uh-oh.
[217:51.31]What?
[217:51.53]Where am I?
[217:54.05]You dead?
[217:54.37]Oh, you fell.
[217:57.29]It's all up to you now.
[217:59.42]So I just have to get there, and we made it.
[218:01.30]We get the loot.
[218:03.24]Yeah, but I want the loot, too.
[218:04.76]Okay.
[218:06.40]Fine.
[218:06.52]You should have taken my time.
[218:09.06]What am I finding?
[218:11.24]There it is.
[218:11.58]Okay, this is $37.
[218:14.99]And... Okay.
[218:15.19]I did it.
[218:26.85]Made it.
[218:28.73]I think I got whatever you got.
[218:31.27]We got deer season available in the customization menu.
[218:35.79]Prepper's treasure.
[218:37.43]Lots of random stuff here.
[218:40.45]Anything good?
[218:41.16]There was a lot of money.
[218:42.60]It was like $2,000, something like that.
[218:44.16]There's a radio up here.
[218:51.08]What are you doing, man?
[218:52.38]Come on.
[218:53.12]Yeah.
[218:56.42]I got a bow.
[218:57.91]Eggs.
[219:01.07]Throwing knife.
[219:02.05]Pretty much just a bunch of random shit.
[219:03.63]Perk magazine.
[219:04.47]Ah, you're definitely going to want to get up here.
[219:06.77]Okay, I'm coming back.
[219:08.25]This is a perk magazine.
[219:09.35]You get this three skill points up here.
[219:15.74]Third time's a charm.
[219:17.08]Nah, I'm going to wingsuit.
[219:18.32]It's going to be amazing.
[219:18.92]I'm going to wingsuit off this.
[219:23.70]Oops.
[219:25.18]Close.
[219:25.52]Oh, wait.
[219:26.06]I think I just took them all.
[219:28.72]Is that how that works?
[219:29.54]Are they on your screen, too?
[219:30.18]I think we each have our own loot.
[219:32.10]Okay.
[219:36.15]Okay, so if I press shift while I fly around here... How do I get the fuck out of here?
[219:58.23]Where did I break down from?
[219:59.23]Like, can I just not get back up here?
[220:00.67]Am I stuck here?
[220:01.25]There we go.
[220:11.85]Hey, there you are.
[220:18.54]Well, that was fun for five seconds.
[220:20.68]Uh, I had that, but I was, like, too scared to detach.
[220:26.79]The dog is currently fighting five people.
[220:28.49]Okay, what did I miss?
[220:38.88]Some cool stuff.
[220:44.91]Beer.
[220:47.33]Beans.
[220:50.47]Where's the perk point?
[220:51.79]Oh.
[220:59.22]I got him.
[221:03.55]The perk magazines?
[221:04.77]They're up.
[221:05.69]Well, I saw three.
[221:06.59]Was that what you were talking about?
[221:07.63]Yeah, you get three perk magazines.
[221:08.79]Oh, when you said, yeah, when you said, for some reason I thought you were talking about like an extra holster slot.
[221:14.31]Oh, no.
[221:15.57]But still good.
[221:16.73]Extra perks.
[221:21.05]How do you get out of here?
[221:24.03]You have to just somehow climb back up.
[221:34.74]Oh, really?
[221:39.20]Like you can't go across that.
[221:44.40]Damn it.
[221:44.72]It's like not even a foot of water.
[221:48.74]That's a subterranean vehicle.
[221:50.76]It can't do that.
[221:51.36]Ah.
[222:02.33]You said there was a bow up here?
[222:04.23]I took it.
[222:05.37]Oh.
[222:06.01]So you actually did take that.
[222:12.25]Almost got that.
[222:21.63]Just wasting arrows now.
[222:25.49]Hey, turn around.
[222:27.72]What?
[222:30.84]How?
[222:31.24]Where?
[222:31.58]What?
[222:32.38]How?
[222:32.72]Where?
[222:33.08]Why was I not revivable?
[222:37.58]I don't know.
[222:38.06]Where did you go?
[222:38.54]I was right next to you.
[222:43.78]Why did I insta-die?
[222:45.00]I don't have any bullets left.
[222:48.77]At least like in Far Cry 4, if I died, I think it would have ended the game or something.
[222:52.53]You have to restart.
[222:54.51]Where are you now?
[222:55.73]I guess I'm going to respawn on you in a second, but right now I'm in third-person mode as you.
[222:59.91]Oh.
[223:03.16]It said ready to respawn in 20 seconds, and it's been 20 seconds.
[223:12.64]Do you want to go to the Statue of Liberty eventually here?
[223:16.10]Or for those of you WoW fans, that thing that's in Booty Bay?
[223:20.42]The statue?
[223:22.36]Hello?
[223:23.48]That was not me.
[223:24.44]Oh, look at the dog.
[223:28.12]Look at him.
[223:28.62]He's getting bugs.
[223:29.52]What's going on?
[223:32.35]The dogs like getting bugs.
[223:35.36]I think somebody's shooting something over here.
[223:40.76]Let's get a helicopter and make something happen.
[223:42.44]Hold on.
[223:42.76]No, no.
[223:42.96]I want to fish.
[223:45.04]I'm not going to rest until I can fish.
[223:47.43]Alright.
[223:47.67]Well, I'm going to go investigate.
[223:49.41]I'll bring the helicopter to you.
[223:50.55]You fish for a minute.
[223:51.77]Hold on.
[223:53.31]Come with me, my child.
[223:55.07]No, I don't want to fish.
[223:56.69]Look.
[223:57.35]You fish.
[223:58.29]I'll get us a nice car.
[223:59.39]I'll get us a nice boat.
[223:59.99]I'm going to drive you over.
[224:01.07]I've already got the boat.
[224:01.91]Look, there's a plane.
[224:02.63]Yeah, we've already done all that.
[224:06.42]You know what we haven't done?
[224:07.50]What?
[224:08.54]Fish.
[224:10.90]I don't want to go fishing.
[224:12.38]We've already done the helicopter.
[224:14.10]We haven't done the boat.
[224:15.66]Yeah, we got it.
[224:16.28]Here it is.
[224:21.26]And, okay.
[224:29.75]Well, that hurt, but I'm okay.
[224:35.07]Now you're just being mean.
[224:39.26]Okay.
[224:40.40]Let's do something fun.
[224:41.14]No fishing.
[224:53.84]Just one fish.
[224:54.68]Oh, god damn it.
[224:56.26]I'm so sorry.
[224:56.92]I just, I saw the thing, and I... You got this fishing thing in my head, and now I can't get it out.
[225:12.93]Whoops.
[225:13.55]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[225:16.33]Hit him again.
[225:16.87]Why is he on fire?
[225:21.03]I'll be there in a minute.
[225:22.40]Soon.
[225:33.23]You gonna give me another concussion or what?
[225:37.85]With your little mudskipper here?
[225:39.44]Alright, now here's the real question.
[225:44.90]Can I get up there without... Can I just climb up?
[225:49.52]No, I can't.
[225:51.58]I wish I could stand on it.
[225:53.32]I mean, I can, but I was seeing if I could stand on the thing.
[225:57.23]Why am I being sniped right now?
[225:58.63]There's a bad guy VIP behind us.
[226:02.98]Okay, I can't do anything, though.
[226:06.18]All I can do is exit the vehicle eventually.
[226:08.18]Alright, take us out.
[226:13.32]Where do we want to go?
[226:15.70]I'll mark something for us to do.
[226:19.60]Ah, here.
[226:20.50]We're going to go to Angel's Peak.
[226:24.44]What are you doing?
[226:27.00]Cult VIP kill!
[226:29.01]You got him?
[226:30.68]Yeah.
[226:31.18]I kind of just dangerously busted him.
[226:32.72]We can both do planes.
[226:33.54]Alright, drop me here.
[226:35.40]Hold on.
[226:36.66]I'm good, I'm good.
[226:37.16]I got a parachute.
[226:37.60]Alright, good.
[226:41.29]We're going to do two planes.
[226:42.65]That's more fun.
[226:43.31]My plane kind of sucks, but yeah.
[226:44.79]But that plane sucks too.
[226:45.59]Is that what's up?
[226:47.15]I mean, like, mine's been shot, but yeah.
[226:55.74]Quick, turn around.
[226:56.34]Yeah, that is going to be a problem.
[226:58.14]We'll just fly together.
[226:59.32]Alright, I'm coming up.
[227:16.85]Okay.
[227:19.79]So now we're both in planes.
[227:21.05]You're right behind me?
[227:22.19]Let's go to the marker.
[227:30.72]Alright, cool.
[227:33.86]So, you're behind me?
[227:35.83]Yeah.
[227:36.55]What's the marker?
[227:37.45]I don't see it on my screen.
[227:38.63]Let's just fly to the funny statue.
[227:40.21]Okay.
[227:41.97]I have a feeling it's going to be, like, off-map somehow.
[227:44.75]Is it?
[227:46.15]This is 900 to 800 meters away.
[227:59.09]Alright, so I'm going to jump out of mine and I'm going to snipe you with the sniper rifle and then take your plane.
[228:04.03]You're going to jump out of yours and then grapple hook onto mine.
[228:07.41]Okay, let's try it.
[228:10.84]Ready for the gamer moment?
[228:11.76]Here it comes.
[228:13.26]We are heading... Did I just destroy the statue?
[228:24.31]It's missing a hand.
[228:29.53]Yeah, you just did, like, a story moment.
[228:34.47]Actually.
[228:38.19]This is a story mission, actually.
[228:39.78]To destroy the father statue.
[228:42.04]And it has a health point pull.
[228:43.18]It's a boss.
[228:43.96]Oh, that's so fucking cool.
[228:45.50]I love it.
[228:46.64]Are you dead?
[228:47.38]I can spawn on you, I think.
[228:49.94]So it's spawning in 20.
[228:50.74]Alright, so here's the new plan.
[228:57.29]How do I spawn?
[228:59.22]Inner, I think.
[229:00.60]For some reason.
[229:02.92]Here's the plan.
[229:03.82]We're going to fly.
[229:04.50]I'm going to go to the top, right?
[229:07.94]And we're going to just try and para-drop to the top of the statue.
[229:11.20]And just shotgun him in the head over and over again?
[229:13.30]Well, like just land on top of him.
[229:15.08]Oh, what's going on with my video game?
[229:17.24]I don't know.
[229:17.54]I'm having some lag up there, too.
[229:19.24]Okay.
[229:19.98]I don't know why.
[229:20.86]You ready?
[229:21.18]Alright, you ready?
[229:22.38]Wait.
[229:23.08]Three, two, one, go.
[229:34.73]I may have waited a little long.
[229:35.75]Uh-oh.
[229:39.13]I wanted to see... I wanted to see... Why am I dead?
[229:41.97]You dead?
[229:43.13]Yeah.
[229:44.17]I'm dead.
[229:48.34]You missed, too.
[229:49.94]How do you control the wingsuit?
[229:50.92]Whoa!
[229:51.28]I just switched.
[229:53.14]Wait, I can pull the parachute and wingsuit?
[229:55.24]Yeah, you can just cause, like, switch back and forth.
[229:57.96]That's cool.
[229:59.36]That's alright, I made it.
[230:02.89]I really don't know how I died.
[230:06.09]I'm coming back though.
[230:11.56]Okay, well that was cool.
[230:21.79]Okay.
[230:23.81]I got a perk point for that apparently.
[230:26.89]Oh my God.
[230:37.08]Nice job, Boomer.
[230:45.17]Hey, nice job, Boomer.
[230:46.05]Good job, Boomer.
[230:52.41]That was fun.
[231:03.22]Can't find him.
[231:05.06]They're looking for us.
[231:09.47]Hey, come on, this is a nice big drop over here.
[231:11.57]No, who cares?
[231:12.25]Alright, destroy it!
[231:15.26]Are you gonna destroy it with a bow?
[231:23.92]I got him in the ass.
[231:26.73]Hey, come over here.
[231:32.49]Hold on, don't throw him yet.
[231:33.23]Hold on a second.
[231:37.63]Drop him, like, right on top of me.
[231:38.83]Hold on, I'll tell you when.
[231:40.15]Let me just descend a little.
[231:44.45]Okay, can you... Can you... Wait, hold on.
[231:48.41]You see where I am on the map?
[231:51.39]Hold on.
[231:52.31]Okay, so... Try to drop him right in my face.
[231:55.19]Whoa!
[232:00.68]I didn't think I was going to get that much hang time.
[232:05.01]Hey, at least you threw him onto the sacrificial throw-the-guy-off side.
[232:08.01]Look at that.
[232:08.37]Yeah, that is what that is, isn't it?
[232:11.17]You're doing him favors.
[232:13.57]Why is there a target painted on the ground?
[232:16.27]For you to do exactly what you just did.
[232:21.57]I'm going to cut the rope.
[232:22.71]Alright, let's go in.
[232:26.51]I think I'm going to have to go inside here.
[232:32.77]This door doesn't open?
[232:33.49]Okay.
[232:36.61]Where is the speaker coming from?
[232:41.23]Can we go up inside the Statue of Liberty?
[232:43.03]I feel like we should be able to.
[232:44.63]I mean, there's lots of... Ooh.
[232:52.86]What is that?
[232:54.54]Is that a rocket launcher?
[232:56.08]Uh-huh.
[232:57.70]Cool.
[232:58.10]Well, you can have my Winchester, I guess.
[233:04.87]Oh, nice job.
[233:06.53]Wow.
[233:08.39]Excellent work.
[233:09.96]Do it again.
[233:16.84]Oh, we got guys.
[233:17.54]Need your company?
[233:21.98]Do you want to shoot the RPG?
[233:23.85]No, I'll take care of the guys, but I didn't even know they were coming.
[233:27.51]So I'm going to die.
[233:29.81]Yep.
[233:31.03]That's oddly satisfying.
[233:32.79]I'm dead on the ground.
[233:39.96]Let me help you there, thank you, okay Okay, apparently I did not shoot him with shotgun and I'm instantly dead again Like literally literally shot the guy with a fucking shotgun directly into his body Hang on I can cling to light.
[233:56.76]Oh wait boomer is boomer dead, too Like how did that guy not get hit by that shotgun new screen literally shot him directly in the chest.
[234:03.52]Oh
[234:07.01]Wait, this isn't a shotgun?
[234:09.05]I thought the weapon you have is a shotgun, right?
[234:10.95]That is a Winchester that you picked up from me.
[234:13.15]Why the hell are you using that?
[234:16.01]Why am I in a plane?
[234:21.68]Are you going to land on top of it?
[234:23.18]Got it.
[234:24.62]Okay, I'm up there.
[234:33.16]Okay, you just barely didn't hit it.
[234:43.34]What are you doing?
[234:45.64]You're just playing with fire.
[234:53.15]And I fell off because I was having fun laughing at that.
[234:56.25]God damn it.
[235:04.82]They want you to fly into his mouth.
[235:08.02]You have to fly into his mouth.
[235:09.84]You have to.
[235:10.96]I will.
[235:11.22]I'll do it.
[235:14.44]Hang on one sec.
[235:27.05]Can I get on his head?
[235:28.97]No, no, no.
[235:29.29]I'm too far away.
[235:32.04]Wait, don't do it yet.
[235:32.86]Don't do it yet.
[235:33.30]Hold on.
[235:33.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[235:33.88]I need to get in a better spot.
[235:36.26]Don't do it yet.
[235:36.86]I don't know if he can hear me.
[235:39.14]Don't do it yet.
[235:39.90]Abort the mission.
[235:40.86]Don't...
[235:42.83]You actually just... I actually... And you're still fine.
[235:45.74]The thing is still driving.
[235:46.70]Unbelievable.
[235:52.94]You gotta be kidding me.
[235:56.70]I made it.
[235:57.04]Oh, look.
[235:58.08]You can go in here.
[236:01.34]I made it.
[236:05.35]I can't move.
[236:06.07]I feel like I didn't get the proper reaction for knocking his head clean off with the airplane.
[236:10.15]I was shocked.
[236:11.37]I can't.
[236:12.01]I'm stuck.
[236:12.83]I can't go in here.
[236:16.47]The game doesn't recognize that I can go in here.
[236:21.49]Like a glove.
[236:24.55]Can I just drop these in here?
[236:26.53]I guess so.
[236:29.79]Yeah, okay.
[236:30.27]I'm fine.
[236:33.95]Where are you going to go next?
[236:34.57]Shoulder?
[236:35.47]Oh, yeah, you are.
[236:36.78]Yeah, you are going for the shoulder.
[236:37.98]Okay.
[236:40.34]Stomach?
[236:40.88]What's next?
[236:42.10]Oh, no.
[236:42.58]Okay.
[236:42.98]We're playing like hide and go shoot here.
[236:44.56]Alright.
[236:45.78]I'm good up here.
[236:46.38]Take care of the rest of them.
[236:49.21]I got problems down here.
[236:50.21]You got problems?
[236:50.81]Let me help you.
[236:51.73]I'm actually going to help you.
[236:52.75]Just steer clear of all those guys.
[236:55.31]Well, Boomer's helping too.
[236:56.53]Good.
[236:56.89]He's just off doing his own thing.
[236:59.11]That was a perfectly placed, perfect dynamite stick.
[237:03.03]Alright, I'm good.
[237:04.27]How are you doing?
[237:04.73]You okay down there?
[237:05.85]I believe we're almost at 100% destruction.
[237:08.73]Alright, we are.
[237:11.18]Is he gonna fall?
[237:12.58]Aw, did he fall?
[237:13.58]Oh, there was a lot of guys blocking the stairs to get up here where you are.
[237:17.90]Um...
[237:34.07]We need to reach there.
[237:35.31]Oh, the thing doesn't even fall.
[237:38.69]Okay, I just need to burn the books.
[237:43.60]Oh, okay.
[237:44.42]I think I did it.
[237:46.44]You did teleport me to the top of the tower.
[237:49.36]Yeah.
[237:50.78]There was supposed to be a fight through the bottom to the top segment, like close quarters combat.
[237:56.22]No, I'm throwing book grenades down there.
[237:58.36]With all the people and here I am okay, we did it congratulations That's gonna be in the strategy guide tomorrow or co-op how to how to like speed run this mission One guy look at all those people that are still down there.
[238:14.47]Yeah, they don't understand oh Come on really did I just shoot?
[238:23.53]Where are we waiting sitting too?
[238:29.00]I hate that this doesn't work.
[238:31.61]I hate that this kick does not actually, like, physically move you.
[238:34.77]I think I disappeared.
[238:36.29]I would have just wingsuited.
[238:37.25]It would have been fun.
[238:38.07]Yeah, but still.
[238:39.61]What are we off to?
[238:46.60]I feel like looting this thing, probably.
[238:48.66]I'm going to wingsuit to the helicopter while you do that.
[238:52.62]There was, like, stuff in here.
[238:55.96]Are you wingsuiting?
[238:56.54]I'm just parachuting down.
[239:04.28]Why is this not... Are you okay?
[239:12.59]I was trying to wingsuit and I just went straight down like a weight!
[239:17.03]I guess you're gonna loot this place after all!
[239:18.95]Apparently!
[239:19.55]I was trying to fly with the wingsuit and try to get some air or something but I just went straight down like a cement brick.
[239:32.35]I thought that was the girl talking.
[239:36.48]Okay, I'm here.
[239:41.20]It's like a lot of stuff.
[239:43.27]Body armor.
[239:45.19]Who's shooting?
[239:45.81]Is that you?
[239:46.23]It's me.
[239:46.61]You've been blessed.
[239:50.35]Okay.
[239:52.37]Give me an actual gun.
[239:55.31]There's the plane.
[239:56.49]The plane's still fine.
[239:58.73]Did you throw a grenade or something?
[240:00.15]No, I'm just up here minding my own business.
[240:03.33]I don't understand how that guy died.
[240:06.27]I'll never know.
[240:11.25]I hear tick-tock, tick-tock.
[240:13.03]Does somebody have the... The switch has got to do something.
[240:19.50]By the way, the plane is down here still.
[240:23.14]Let's get out of here with the plane.
[240:24.78]Hold on.
[240:25.24]There's like a thing I want to do.
[240:28.56]How do you get this ladder down?
[240:34.98]I don't think this thing can... No, this thing can't drive.
[240:46.39]No, it definitely can't drive.
[240:54.45]We're safe.
[241:05.11]Speaking of guns.
[241:05.55]What do we got here?
[241:11.33]I like the idea of the bow and arrow, but it doesn't seem to do anything.
[241:15.14]Uh, it's called stealth.
[241:16.08]You may have heard of it.
[241:17.72]Stealth with bow and arrow.
[241:19.54]You want to go bow and arrow and do stealth.
[241:22.62]I didn't say I wanted to, but you said I don't see the point of it, or whatever you said.
[241:26.84]And that's the point of it.
[241:29.38]Because you can, can you take down from like 30 feet away?
[241:31.83]I need to figure out the wingsuit.
[241:35.54]Wingsuit it up.
[241:36.08]Let's go.
[241:36.60]Wingsuit.
[241:38.74]You know what's the best place to wingsuit, right?
[241:41.06]From the top of the tower that we just exploded?
[241:44.08]I'm trying to figure it out.
[241:45.86]Do you have one?
[241:47.50]Yeah.
[241:48.20]Just do it because I can't understand how this works.
[241:51.30]What is me doing it going to do to help you figure out how to do it?
[241:54.27]So I can watch you do it and watch you fall to the ground.
[242:00.59]Oh yeah, that's true.
[242:01.99]Maybe I can't lower the ladder because we already did the mission.
[242:05.29]That's true.
[242:06.63]If so, that's kind of not a good thing.
[242:09.97]Where are you?
[242:10.90]So I can go towards you.
[242:13.10]Take a left.
[242:13.98]Straight.
[242:15.26]I'm on the cliff.
[242:18.06]I feel like I don't have enough hang time.
[242:19.64]Don't hold W. There's definitely enough hang time.
[242:22.94]You just need to activate it.
[242:26.80]Okay, so you just did it.
[242:29.66]Okay, so, yeah.
[242:32.20]How are you?
[242:32.78]Are you good?
[242:36.94]Are you dead?
[242:37.34]Yeah.
[242:40.92]It's a little hard to turn.
[242:41.82]A little hard to turn.
[242:44.00]I don't even know where you went.
[242:45.12]Oh, you're very dead.
[242:50.69]Yeah, no, I'm very dead.
[242:54.61]Are you just gonna spawn on me?
[242:59.19]campsite.
[242:59.79]Cool.
[243:03.73]Oh, a shovel.
[243:04.73]Now this is a hoe.
[243:10.24]I want to turn the wingsuit on.
[243:14.62]From right here.
[243:17.12]Alright, I got it.
[243:21.18]I have the wrong gun.
[243:33.58]I figured it out.
[243:41.35]Oh, I thought you were the dog.
[243:47.59]That looked very painful for you.
[243:49.58]For me?
[243:50.00]What did I do?
[243:50.82]You got shot in the head like three times.
[243:52.36]Oh.
[243:53.34]Yeah, that's true.
[244:01.33]Where are you?
[244:02.53]Oh, how did you get over here?
[244:04.71]Why?
[244:05.07]I don't know.
[244:05.79]I... He's just annoyed.
[244:07.49]I just rescued this man.
[244:10.41]Give me the hull back.
[244:14.57]Whose needs to be saved?
[244:16.11]The guy that... It was the partner of the guy you just killed.
[244:25.02]It's a very accurate RPG.
[244:29.40]Alright, let's do something.
[244:31.48]We just did.
[244:32.38]We just blew.
[244:33.42]Listen, the statue.
[244:35.12]Actually, no, that's true.
[244:36.74]The giant statue that we literally just blew up.
[244:39.48]That was like an emergent mission that you just do.
[244:41.74]And that was really cool when you took his head off with the plane.
[244:44.56]That was pretty sick.
[244:45.34]Alright, let's go.
[244:46.62]Less than five minutes ago.
[244:47.95]Yeah, it was.
[244:48.57]You're right.
[244:49.03]That was really cool.
[244:50.67]Don't demanding.
[244:51.39]Ubisoft can't keep up with you.
[244:52.59]Alright, what's the closest thing we can do here?
[244:59.46]We just keep... We can either go to Ray Ray's farm or do whatever we want to do.
[245:05.18]Let's... Are you overwhelmed with the freedom?
[245:08.75]I mean, there's a lot of freedom.
[245:09.87]Let's go up to the Peaches Taxidermy.
[245:12.13]You want to... Let's just getting the Cougar.
[245:14.05]We've already got the dog.
[245:16.57]Okay.
[245:17.07]Well... I mean, the bear would be an upgrade.
[245:20.11]I mean, the bear would be a pretty good upgrade.
[245:22.36]That's a long ways away, though.
[245:24.28]Yeah.
[245:24.88]That's why they have planes and flying vehicles.
[245:31.67]What about this?
[245:32.87]The trailer park?
[245:37.33]Okay.
[245:37.75]I mean, each one of those picture people is like another companion that we can rescue.
[245:42.61]I mean, we are right next to... There's a mission here.
[245:44.88]There's a story mission for Merle Briggs.
[245:46.88]You want to just do it?
[245:48.48]Yeah, that's fine.
[245:49.48]Let's just do it.
[245:51.60]It's right there.
[245:52.40]Might as well just go.
[245:53.86]Are you in the car?
[245:55.36]Yeah.
[245:55.76]Well, no.
[245:56.48]Yeah.
[245:58.28]Yeah, no, yeah.
[245:59.14]I was in the map like I thought I was, and then I had to double check.
[246:07.14]I need a cr- Again, I thought that fucking bird was attacking you!
[246:12.07]What?
[246:12.29]I just thought the bird was flying into the screen!
[246:15.29]That's just the... The decoration?
[246:18.65]Oh my god.
[246:19.79]I'm telling you right now, that bird was going after you, and it was a fucking eagle.
[246:23.99]And we're going... Google, Google, I need you.
[246:27.71]Turn on friendly fire.
[246:28.85]I need Google.
[246:29.47]Don't we have friendly fire on?
[246:31.99]The fucking ferocious eagle that was going after you, man.
[246:34.38]I'm telling you.
[246:36.64]Okay.
[246:38.70]Why is friendly fire off?
[246:39.84]Oh my fucking god.
[246:43.26]How am I stuck here?
[246:47.56]Now it's off.
[246:48.26]I mean, on.
[246:59.47]Oh, I'm gonna pass out.
[247:00.35]I gotta calm down.
[247:03.23]I... I don't know what happened.
[247:05.70]Why did you... You just didn't make a conjuring trailer.
[247:08.46]I don't know.
[247:13.78]I don't know why.
[247:15.46]Why did I get here?
[247:17.62]I'm just stuck down here.
[247:18.94]Which Insidious sequel are you in right now?
[247:21.05]Is this you?
[247:24.41]Is this you?
[247:24.81]Ugh.
[247:28.47]Hi.
[247:29.73]We turned friendly fire on before the stream.
[247:32.69]We did?
[247:33.01]Yeah, we did.
[247:34.01]We did, but it was off the whole time.
[247:35.91]Oh.
[247:37.07]Till now.
[247:40.57]Is that guy trying to steal the car?
[247:42.35]Yeah.
[247:43.63]Well, not anymore.
[247:44.88]Goodbye.
[247:45.26]Alright, get me in this.
[247:48.40]So, that kind of explains why neither of us have been dying to the other person's explosion.
[247:52.46]That makes sense.
[247:55.76]Oh!
[247:56.60]That was as close as I could have gone.
[247:57.62]You almost did the unthinkable.
[247:59.50]And you're still about to.
[248:00.36]I'm trying to get him out of the way.
[248:02.37]Who's this guy, like, right standing here like a ghost?
[248:05.83]This dude?
[248:06.79]Shoot him.
[248:07.15]Well, that's the bad guy.
[248:07.99]I'm talking about the... There's a good guy with a quest right there.
[248:09.93]You're getting rid of the ghost here?
[248:11.13]Yeah, there is a ghost.
[248:11.77]You're right.
[248:13.37]We always have to get rid of the ghosts.
[248:14.55]It's important.
[248:17.08]Heard a rumor that there's a cougar roaming the forest near Mabel's taxidermy.
[248:20.64]Wouldn't surprise me if that crazy old lady trained her to hunt piggies.
[248:31.71]What the fuck was that?
[248:33.89]Oh my god, dude.
[248:35.63]You're not gonna be able to come get me now.
[248:38.07]Why?
[248:38.55]No, I have to give up.
[248:44.65]If I don't... I'm giving up.
[248:47.27]Not gonna let that happen.
[248:51.70]We lost a car.
[248:52.62]The car was up there.
[248:54.52]Whose car is this?
[248:55.70]That's the one that got exploded.
[248:59.84]That I got exploded out of.
[249:01.61]Easy with this thing.
[249:05.15]Easy.
[249:09.19]Oh, I'm going up!
[249:11.53]What?
[249:13.33]Wait, what?
[249:14.69]There's something about this van, man.
[249:16.48]Come help me, please.
[249:17.94]I'm dead.
[249:18.28]I'm completely dead.
[249:20.78]How did you get flipped up there?
[249:22.58]I don't know.
[249:23.04]The car is possessed and knocked me in the air.
[249:25.10]This van in particular.
[249:26.40]Yeah.
[249:28.54]Keep it.
[249:32.89]Where are you taking that?
[249:34.27]There's nowhere else to go.
[249:35.55]Where are you driving down a river?
[249:37.15]There's nowhere else to drive.
[249:39.21]And you ruined it.
[249:40.93]It's gone, isn't it?
[249:41.59]Yeah, but I tried both sides of the hill.
[249:45.29]There was nowhere else to go.
[249:51.42]Okay, we'll get it.
[249:52.44]It's gonna get back on the land here in a second, and we can drive it off.
[249:55.29]Alright.
[249:56.35]Actually, no, no, no.
[249:57.67]Take it down the river.
[249:58.87]It's waterlogged.
[250:00.15]Are you sure?
[250:01.79]What happens if we take it down the river, and it goes all the way down?
[250:04.91]I mean, it's kind of already my little raft.
[250:07.65]Yeah, let's use it as a raft, and we'll take it all the way downstream.
[250:11.18]It's gonna be really slow.
[250:13.00]Shit.
[250:14.54]How did you get up there?
[250:15.12]Alright, I'm in.
[250:21.14]I'm in.
[250:22.84]What?
[250:23.68]I'm in the car.
[250:24.24]I'm good.
[250:24.66]You're just walking next to it.
[250:26.79]I'm not.
[250:27.21]I'm in it.
[250:28.13]You're walking next to it.
[250:31.25]I'm the car now.
[250:32.01]It's a giant cardboard box.
[250:33.63]It's a cardboard car.
[250:36.27]You're absolutely swimming just next to it.
[250:38.96]Well, who do you think's moving it?
[250:43.46]And let's get that on land.
[250:45.72]Let's see.
[250:46.96]Oh, is that why it's like turning to the right now?
[250:50.37]I think there's like a waterfall coming up.
[250:52.69]Is there a waterfall?
[250:53.35]Alright, yeah.
[250:54.43]Get into the waterfall.
[250:56.07]Having some flashbacks to last week.
[250:59.03]This is fine.
[251:02.45]Once we get it there, we'll be fine.
[251:04.04]Oh, now you're in the car.
[251:05.36]Yeah, I'm just inside.
[251:06.18]Easy.
[251:06.28]To the left a little bit here.
[251:16.38]How can you wheels not touch the ground at this point?
[251:20.62]um we're just coming to a start no no no it's still moving slowly it's almost there give it some time oh it's almost there keep on can you get behind and push no no it's gonna make it it's going I don't know I think it's gonna get wedged between these two rocks no no no it's going it is moving slightly weirdly it's moving when I don't I'm not moving
[251:49.81]I'm trying just to run inside of here.
[251:54.40]No, it's definitely still going downstream.
[251:58.96]What is this Disney ride?
[252:00.04]Yeah, this is Splash Mountain.
[252:03.06]I feel like it's about to... We're gonna... Ready to get your picture taken?
[252:06.00]Is it gonna make it down?
[252:06.73]It's gonna take our picture and we can see our funny screaming face.
[252:10.61]Oh no, it stopped.
[252:11.91]What happened?
[252:12.25]It definitely stopped.
[252:17.93]No!
[252:21.32]No, I refuse.
[252:22.10]Stay there.
[252:25.98]Watch out.
[252:26.28]Get out of the way from behind here.
[252:32.78]This is not going to end well.
[252:34.80]Yep, that's what I thought was going to happen.
[252:37.18]Bingo, bango, it's done.
[252:38.44]And guess what?
[252:39.04]It's going down.
[252:41.88]Quick, get in the ride.
[252:44.94]Get in.
[252:45.26]Can we get in the back?
[252:48.83]Try to get in the back.
[252:53.39]Damn it!
[252:53.99]Get in the back!
[252:56.61]Alright, here we go.
[252:58.73]I'll take the ride on top.
[252:59.87]Take the picture.
[253:02.64]Oh, here it comes!
[253:04.66]Yeah, get the cameras out.
[253:08.04]Whoa!
[253:10.44]Oh my god, we've fallen!
[253:24.29]What?
[253:24.93]Are you serious?
[253:25.69]We're still going?
[253:26.67]Somebody I know just died, but it's alright.
[253:30.95]There's the payoff.
[253:32.61]We're gonna get another picture.
[253:35.91]Oh, boy.
[253:41.44]Are you still in it?
[253:42.54]Yeah, I'm still in it.
[253:43.54]I'm good.
[253:44.18]Wow.
[253:45.62]I'm impressed.
[253:47.70]Wow, that was a cool ride.
[253:50.02]Everybody thought it was going to be like an overlong joke that we had no payoff.
[253:54.06]There you go.
[253:54.72]You got the payoff.
[253:55.50]There it is.
[253:56.08]Good.
[253:56.84]That was worth it.
[254:01.36]Where were we?
[254:02.04]We were going to... We were doing something.
[254:04.01]I don't know what the hell it was.
[254:04.87]Alright.
[254:05.21]There's like a bad guy post.
[254:08.85]Bad guy?
[254:24.17]What are you sneaking in?
[254:25.13]Are you sneaky?
[254:26.67]I'm sneaking currently.
[254:34.15]What did you just do to that guy?
[254:35.49]Wow.
[254:36.85]That was pretty cool, actually.
[254:38.25]Did you see that?
[254:38.97]Yeah.
[254:39.11]Hold on.
[254:39.43]Let me try.
[254:41.33]Hang on.
[254:41.67]Is there a whistle?
[254:42.39]Do they still have whistle?
[254:43.81]Watch out.
[254:44.23]I can't move.
[254:44.71]You're in the way.
[254:45.77]What?
[254:46.91]I couldn't hide.
[254:48.35]There's only so much cover right here that you walked up on.
[254:51.91]Well, everything's fine.
[254:52.79]We're gonna get the monster truck anyways.
[254:54.15]Here we go.
[255:03.21]Now let's- we got a road here.
[255:04.45]Don't need to worry about it.
[255:09.78]Uhh, what is this?
[255:18.91]Somebody on a camping trip.
[255:20.91]I didn't do anything.
[255:21.65]I don't know how an innocent civilian is.
[255:22.99]You absolutely ran over that civilian.
[255:24.83]I did not run somebody over.
[255:27.30]Somebody clip it and I'm going to see.
[255:29.68]I saw it.
[255:30.68]He was right there on the road.
[255:31.98]No, he was not.
[255:37.06]I seriously didn't see it.
[255:38.20]I mean, I see this guy.
[255:43.89]And like a goodbye to that guy, but...
[255:52.30]You good?
[255:52.92]Yeah, I'm good.
[255:56.43]Sharp turn.
[256:07.21]That was my last one.
[256:08.63]Okay, he's right here.
[256:09.63]I kind of need change guns.
[256:11.27]I just released the brakes.
[256:14.27]I thought it was release this guy.
[256:20.64]Release the brakes.
[256:21.12]I thought this guy's name was Brakes.
[256:23.14]So that you... So you can make like a... I don't understand.
[256:27.94]Like a trap where it rolls down the hill?
[256:30.27]And you put like an explosive on it?
[256:41.73]Can you... I don't think I can interact with this guy.
[256:44.86]Okay.
[256:45.98]Oh, yeah.
[256:46.84]You have to interact with this guy.
[256:48.14]I can't do it.
[256:48.56]I just wanted to see if there's like anything else...
[256:55.08]Can you not interact with him?
[256:57.16]No.
[256:57.70]You can't.
[256:58.40]Hold on.
[256:58.66]Let me see if I can fix it.
[257:13.11]I think I fixed it.
[257:15.67]Are you going to lift me up or what?
[257:20.31]What is going on?
[257:25.54]Fix it.
[257:26.32]Good.
[257:29.86]Oh, what's that?
[257:30.74]He's just standing in the fire.
[257:33.93]That's the same gun you currently have, yes.
[257:37.67]Okay, hi.
[257:40.21]Still can't talk to him?
[257:44.05]What is... Oh, we got collapsed on him.
[257:54.43]Was it one guy?
[257:55.33]I think it was just one guy.
[257:56.75]So what do we do about this?
[257:59.79]I don't know, but he's just staring up.
[258:03.66]I can revive him.
[258:04.48]Okay, revive him and try to talk to him.
[258:10.32]He's got a gun now.
[258:12.48]This guy might be broken.
[258:13.38]What is the quest?
[258:14.80]The quest is this guy has a thing on his head.
[258:16.88]I feel like he doesn't have a quest anymore.
[258:21.21]But why wouldn't he?
[258:23.37]It's not on the map.
[258:25.44]Oh.
[258:29.14]Maybe that's all we have to do for him right now?
[258:33.12]But he's still got a thing on his head.
[258:34.82]Yeah.
[258:38.36]Okay.
[258:39.66]I don't know.
[258:40.78]Alright, on to the next thing.
[258:43.17]We need to reload the save, somebody said.
[258:46.17]Damn it.
[258:47.23]Does it kill the rest of the enemies?
[258:48.45]Are there more enemies here?
[258:51.22]I guess we can go look through the rest of this little area.
[258:53.32]There's definitely, um... There's some friendly-looking people.
[258:57.76]But no bad guys.
[258:59.84]I haven't seen any bad guys.
[259:04.73]I don't know.
[259:07.17]Hmm.
[259:10.27]Now he's just kind of talking to himself.
[259:18.36]Maybe we should just move on.
[259:20.72]Okay.
[259:29.55]Did you just... I thought you had him in your hands.
[259:31.55]I was like, how did you... I just wanted to give it one more chance, you know?
[259:36.24]Alright, I know what time it is.
[259:39.74]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[259:43.62]Where's my marker?
[259:45.84]What time is it?
[259:46.57]Why are you saying the time?
[259:48.57]Uh, because... It is time... To go... Fishing!
[259:56.01]Oh, no.
[259:57.31]God damn it.
[259:58.64]It's right here.
[259:59.49]80 meters away.
[260:03.29]It really is right here.
[260:05.95]I hope you get a ton of satisfaction from this.
[260:10.45]Listen, you're just afraid that you're gonna like it.
[260:17.08]Oh my god.
[260:19.62]She's like singing to herself.
[260:21.86]That was so unnecessary.
[260:27.01]And I'm down.
[260:28.35]Got greedy.
[260:31.29]Holy shit.
[260:35.00]Okay, time to fish.
[260:37.14]I think it's this guy, right?
[260:42.06]Who is this?
[260:44.50]He's in conflict right now, and he's not sure that he wants to speak to us.
[260:51.95]Look what you've done.
[260:54.05]He's fine.
[260:54.47]A buddy heard Zip ranting about how he was going to launch some kind of attack on the cult.
[260:59.72]Zip's brave.
[261:00.62]He's also crazy.
[261:02.52]Bring back Diana.
[261:05.74]Speaking of, where is the dog?
[261:08.72]I don't know.
[261:10.18]Oh, there's a boat shop too?
[261:12.31]Alright, get your fishing rod.
[261:13.41]Look, there's no shop.
[261:15.47]There's no guy shop here.
[261:19.85]Seaplane?
[261:23.20]Can buy a seaplane.
[261:26.10]I think I wanna buy this just to have it forever.
[261:28.67]Where's the general, they said there was a general store here.
[261:30.99]I bought the plane.
[261:33.29]Oh, okay.
[261:34.81]Just to have it forever.
[261:36.11]So I can always spawn it.
[261:40.09]The boats are actually pretty fun to drive.
[261:43.01]Oh, there they are.
[261:46.05]Anything else?
[261:47.57]Plenty of, get some more body armor.
[261:50.71]Okay, that's good.
[261:54.41]I got nothing?
[261:54.95]Alright.
[261:55.97]Alright, so give me my plane.
[261:59.07]How do you spawn?
[262:00.97]Uh, you have to, like, push space on the vehicle that you selected.
[262:05.76]Cool.
[262:12.42]I'm so glad I get this every time I want.
[262:19.14]Yeah, only, like, $2,000 for a plane.
[262:24.12]You're going to be teleported to me.
[262:25.62]Am I?
[262:25.82]Are you sure?
[262:26.50]I might not.
[262:28.88]If I can get there fast enough.
[262:32.98]I'm going to get there quickly.
[262:36.44]I'm coming to you.
[262:37.52]You're going towards... I'm going towards the marker.
[262:40.02]The green general store.
[262:41.60]Me too.
[262:42.58]On the map.
[262:43.74]I'm on my way there as well.
[263:02.52]This is a good guy don't kill us gay don't do it.
[263:22.34]I'm not gonna do it.
[263:23.38]Oh
[263:28.63]Funny voice.
[263:29.37]That was a shitty Jim Carrey impression.
[263:31.43]What are you talking about?
[263:35.63]Okay.
[263:36.63]So where do you find it?
[263:37.94]It's all the way on the far right side.
[263:42.12]I'm going to buy the expensive one because it has more rate of fire.
[263:45.36]$800.
[263:47.58]This is half as much as an airplane.
[263:50.56]Yeah, you could just buy an airplane.
[263:52.08]This is taking it very seriously.
[263:53.66]What about bait?
[263:54.91]Do we have to buy bait?
[263:55.61]I don't know.
[263:56.39]Do you?
[263:58.56]Alright, so... Now we've got... Whoa.
[264:08.35]Okay.
[264:10.07]Just shoot Shilly String?
[264:11.25]Shilly String?
[264:15.45]You wanna have a... You wanna have a fight?
[264:19.50]Oh my god.
[264:23.92]We're just not... We're honestly... We're just on the color guard.
[264:29.21]Where's some water?
[264:30.52]Alright, let's go.
[264:31.48]Find a little water.
[264:32.24]We don't need to find water.
[264:33.38]I just go and get in the plane.
[264:37.50]Look, right there.
[264:39.62]No, I want to do a cool fishing journey.
[264:42.36]Okay, you can go land on the water with your new plane.
[264:45.38]Thank you very much.
[264:46.86]Nice paint job.
[264:47.86]Are you in?
[264:50.20]I am in.
[264:50.59]Alright.
[264:54.87]This is a fly fishing rod.
[264:56.23]You do not use bait.
[264:58.92]Let's get to the ocean or something and hang out on the side.
[265:04.48]Before we do that, I'm going to try to do two barrels in a row, okay?
[265:08.12]Okay.
[265:15.67]Got it.
[265:16.63]Good job.
[265:22.27]Quality work.
[265:23.03]Let's land it right here.
[265:36.65]Whatever.
[265:43.25]My plane's kind of all the way over there, isn't it?
[265:45.88]Nah, I'm gonna just drive it over there.
[265:48.02]So we don't have to swim.
[265:55.70]Why am I in the backseat?
[265:56.88]Are you kidding me?
[265:58.93]Why would you get in the backseat?
[266:02.57]Is somebody gonna drive for you?
[266:06.37]Uh... What?
[266:08.83]Come on, I'm coming.
[266:15.22]No, I don't want to take off.
[266:16.16]Alright, what's... Hi.
[266:22.12]I just destroyed your whole area here.
[266:24.64]Alright, what do we need to do?
[266:26.77]This is the fishing spot that you just parked in?
[266:29.49]Yes.
[266:31.03]And?
[266:31.75]Might be hard to get fish when you scared them all away.
[266:35.45]Look at what we have here on the ground.
[266:37.01]Yeah.
[266:38.31]Fishing rods.
[266:39.49]But not cool blue ones.
[266:41.81]I mean, that's true, but there's still a free fishing rod here.
[266:44.93]And also bad guys.
[266:49.14]Nice shot, me.
[266:52.22]Will these guys fuck off?
[266:53.12]We're trying to fish.
[266:56.71]Hey.
[266:58.21]Cut it out, dude.
[266:59.13]Relax.
[267:00.65]Who?
[267:01.71]The guy in front of me.
[267:03.57]Who is looking at me?
[267:04.45]I don't see anybody.
[267:08.45]I don't see anybody.
[267:09.50]Who are you seeing?
[267:10.30]Are you seeing another ghost?
[267:11.90]Oh, there's a guy.
[267:12.56]He just fired a... He just shot a reinforcement flare.
[267:15.32]He just shot a flare in the air?
[267:16.66]Really?
[267:17.10]Yeah.
[267:22.12]Where do you get the... Where does the fishing rod come from?
[267:28.67]I can't tell if I'm shooting at a tree or if I'm hitting this guy.
[267:34.25]Okay, now we can see him.
[267:39.04]How do you pull out the fishing rod again?
[267:40.92]Melee weapon?
[267:45.70]No.
[267:51.93]I don't know if I can hit this dude.
[267:54.71]Can you figure that out?
[267:55.81]I'm gonna look in the options.
[268:01.11]Why?
[268:01.73]The answer is why.
[268:04.99]Yeah, this thing's not accurate enough to shoot this far.
[268:09.69]Hitting the guy, like, in the chest.
[268:11.66]Sometimes.
[268:16.94]Why is this guy still alive?
[268:20.12]Huh?
[268:24.29]What is exploding?
[268:25.91]Whoa!
[268:29.86]I just wanted to fish.
[268:33.10]I just wanted to catch a trout.
[268:34.98]Did somebody drop a mortar on us?
[268:38.27]I do think that maybe we just got mortared, yeah.
[268:44.25]From where?
[268:45.59]Who has a mortar pointed over there?
[268:47.51]Give me a break.
[268:50.01]Well, look, we can fish right here.
[268:54.54]Give me a break.
[268:55.28]My goodness.
[268:56.42]Can we fish off this?
[268:59.34]I think it has to be pretty close to the water.
[269:01.28]There's fishing spots.
[269:03.51]And he said fishing would be boring.
[269:05.71]Oh, I can fish off of this.
[269:15.61]I see fish coming.
[269:16.45]Here we go.
[269:19.67]No, you ruined it.
[269:24.04]What are you doing?
[269:24.62]There were fish right there!
[269:25.54]How did I ruin it?
[269:27.84]You think they got scared of my wingsuit?
[269:29.58]Yeah, they did.
[269:30.60]I saw people coming after it.
[269:32.92]No, get back up here.
[269:33.88]Me?
[269:34.84]No, no, no.
[269:35.96]This stupid thing.
[269:43.26]I can fish from up here.
[269:45.32]My fishing spot right here.
[269:46.42]Got it.
[269:46.68]I got my spot.
[269:51.26]So how do you fish?
[269:52.92]Uh, you... You're about to find out.
[269:57.16]You look... I think you go for the fishing... What?
[270:10.33]Did you get one?
[270:11.07]Yeah.
[270:14.95]No, you didn't.
[270:15.89]Look at... Do you not see what I'm doing right now?
[270:18.55]But you have one in your hands.
[270:20.72]I'm currently catching one.
[270:23.90]Wow.
[270:26.00]You can throw that line so far?
[270:32.02]I need to oppose his movements, but I don't know where he is, and I can't see that far.
[270:40.09]It was funny for a second or two, but I need to be able to see.
[270:45.11]There we go.
[270:54.05]Okay.
[270:55.85]Alright.
[271:00.55]Got one coming up.
[271:02.07]Almost.
[271:05.96]Yeah, I need to be close to the water.
[271:13.50]Too much tension!
[271:15.26]Yeah, watch out for the red tension.
[271:17.34]You'll pop it.
[271:21.91]Come on, somebody get over here.
[271:24.39]I can see one.
[271:24.87]Come on.
[271:28.82]Come on.
[271:31.42]There we go.
[271:34.32]Finally.
[271:35.96]Rainbow trout, 21.75 pounds.
[271:36.94]Beat it.
[271:37.30]Okay.
[271:37.42]Rainbow trout.
[271:54.62]12 pounds.
[271:58.73]Not 21.72.
[272:00.03]Hey, get the fuck out of here casting on my side.
[272:04.51]Get out of here.
[272:05.91]Fine.
[272:15.80]Look at all these fish.
[272:20.58]Oh, yeah.
[272:23.04]The race is on.
[272:30.61]Get out of the way!
[272:31.13]What do you mean, get out of the way?
[272:33.01]I've got a fish!
[272:33.63]What do you got?
[272:34.05]You just scared everybody.
[272:34.91]You just scared everybody.
[272:36.77]Got another one.
[272:37.39]What is it?
[272:39.31]13.53.
[272:39.45]Yeah, we'll see.
[272:41.27]21.
[272:41.31]21's still the best.
[272:43.09]When he splashed, they all ran away.
[272:48.53]Come on.
[272:50.07]You can just really chunk that out there.
[272:52.61]You having some trouble over there?
[272:57.28]Yeah, you splashed a bunch of splashes and the fish all ran away.
[273:06.63]By the way, when you're fishing, you don't just hold right trigger.
[273:10.63]No, I don't.
[273:11.69]I'm just telling chat.
[273:12.77]Like, they probably just think we're just like... All you gotta do is just hold it until it gets there.
[273:17.73]You actually have to like... No, there's one right there.
[273:19.35]I'll get him.
[273:20.65]Not break the line.
[273:21.61]Get over here, you little shit.
[273:30.40]Oh, I'm catching a little babies.
[273:31.72]I think I peaked early.
[273:32.68]I got three.
[273:34.20]How many do you have?
[273:35.22]This is my second error.
[273:45.46]Rainbow trout.
[273:49.03]38 pounds.
[273:50.01]No, you're lying.
[273:50.71]38 pounds.
[273:51.25]Liar.
[273:51.41]13.
[273:51.43]I know.
[273:51.71]I can see right through you.
[273:56.02]1321.
[273:56.12]I can see right through you.
[274:11.99]Comes another one.
[274:15.31]Come on.
[274:15.73]Got him.
[274:16.41]Oh, 30, 40.
[274:16.99]I have a 160-pound trout.
[274:18.21]Oh, 160 pounds.
[274:18.95]Yeah.
[274:21.09]We're going to have to take like a whaling ship through here for that one.
[274:25.67]What's this one?
[274:28.45]12.9.
[274:30.71]I feel like this spot sucks.
[274:32.92]Yeah.
[274:33.22]Because we're all little baby fish.
[274:34.94]Okay.
[274:35.38]I'm going to go to that plane over there.
[274:36.74]I'm taking off.
[274:39.48]Let me throw dice into the water.
[274:42.90]You don't know how big the fish are.
[274:45.54]Oh, this is going to be a big one.
[274:50.15]I can feel it.
[274:50.59]Oh, he's fighting me.
[274:51.27]I can feel it.
[274:52.79]This is going to be huge.
[275:14.61]How big is it?
[275:17.23]That's the lightest one I've caught so far.
[275:21.95]I got a fighter too.
[275:23.35]Is there a hammock over here?
[275:24.30]Oh, no.
[275:29.26]I thought it was a hammock.
[275:31.76]Oh, oh.
[275:36.62]That's another big one.
[275:37.54]24.6.
[275:37.62]The fuck?
[275:39.42]Why?
[275:39.94]What the heck?
[275:41.46]It's all about this spot right here.
[275:42.66]It doesn't make any sense.
[275:43.90]You're on the good spot.
[275:46.39]Come over here to the dock.
[275:47.45]24 pounder.
[275:50.89]Wow.
[275:56.89]Give me a different kind of fish.
[275:57.94]Is there only one fish in here?
[275:59.68]Yeah, this is the trout area.
[276:02.34]We're literally in rainbow trout zone.
[276:06.04]You fishing down there.
[276:06.88]You're in the bull trout zone.
[276:09.00]I'm in the rainbow trout zone.
[276:10.48]I think that's the difference.
[276:12.38]I got a bull trout?
[276:14.53]Yeah.
[276:14.99]So I'm catching rainbow trout.
[276:18.03]Which apparently are heavier and more difficult to catch.
[276:21.65]I was catching rainbow trout before.
[276:23.99]Yeah, but you moved further downstream.
[276:25.60]Oh, no, no, no.
[276:26.08]I don't want to be teleported to you.
[276:28.80]Don't run away from me then.
[276:30.34]I'm trying to find a good spot.
[276:32.19]This spot's where I am right here.
[276:33.89]I don't want to do your spot.
[276:35.89]I want to be in my own spot.
[276:36.63]It's the one on the map, though.
[276:38.95]This is the last time.
[276:39.59]I'm going to get one more of these.
[276:40.41]It's not like I just invented this spot.
[276:44.45]There's a merchant here, too.
[276:45.27]I wonder what he wants.
[276:52.77]Big one.
[276:55.09]Give him some slack.
[276:59.53]This one's actually fighting me pretty good, too.
[277:02.30]I wonder if it's going to be not a 12-pound fish.
[277:09.04]I'm going to laugh if it's a shoe.
[277:10.04]26.9.
[277:10.12]Alright, let's see if it's a shoe.
[277:12.74]Alright, I have had my fun.
[277:23.11]I have had my fun.
[277:25.09]What is this thing?
[277:29.45]There's like another guy in the water with you down there.
[277:31.75]Do I even have a fish?
[277:32.87]Oh, they're bad guys.
[277:34.35]Boy, the guy next to me is a bad guy.
[277:35.85]There's two bad guys fishing right next to you.
[277:38.43]Are you serious?
[277:39.75]Yeah.
[277:40.57]I feel like he's actually killing someone.
[277:44.08]Is he baptizing somebody?
[277:45.32]Dude, this thing... I got a prize fish here for sure.
[278:11.06]I think I'm getting too far away from you.
[278:13.08]So just so that you don't lose your fish.
[278:14.46]Oh, I hope you don't lose... No, I need to get this guy.
[278:17.82]I ran back towards you.
[278:24.20]I gotta go all the way downriver to find you.
[278:31.27]I can't even tell which way the fish is even going right now.
[278:41.51]Okay.
[278:43.93]Will you get over here, please?
[278:45.81]Look, I'm coming.
[278:46.41]I'm coming, okay?
[278:47.05]No, I'm talking about this fish.
[278:48.95]Oh.
[278:50.29]I got a fucking whale.
[278:52.56]This thing is huge.
[278:58.44]I love the path.
[278:59.26]The melee weapons are really fun.
[279:03.32]No, don't let him get away.
[279:12.08]Bees?
[279:13.34]Oh, I am reeling.
[279:14.32]Trust me.
[279:15.44]You're still reeling the same fish?
[279:16.86]I really am.
[279:17.68]I swear to God.
[279:18.44]I think I'm getting trolled here.
[279:23.56]I really do.
[279:25.30]I don't think there's anything on this line.
[279:26.58]I think I'm dragging it through mud.
[279:27.48]Alright, look.
[279:28.04]I'm going to give you some pro tips.
[279:30.28]Arc your rod up.
[279:34.51]Tilt it up.
[279:35.33]That's what I'm doing.
[279:36.35]Towards you.
[279:36.77]What do you mean towards me?
[279:38.47]He's currently swimming away from me.
[279:40.56]Well, on my screen, it looks like you're just holding it straight out.
[279:43.22]Like, look up really high.
[279:44.94]I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[279:46.58]Are you right-clicking, too, and you're reeling?
[279:48.20]Oh, absolutely.
[279:48.98]Do you hear, like, the shh?
[279:50.82]I mean, I see you doing it, but I don't hear anything.
[279:52.64]But, yeah.
[279:53.78]Get a little closer to him.
[279:55.52]Let me get a little closer.
[279:56.48]Walk, like, a couple steps closer.
[280:03.59]What?
[280:04.95]What's going on?
[280:05.45]Can I get this fucking fish, please?
[280:08.93]Uh, you gotta be doing something weird.
[280:11.75]I'm not doing anything wrong!
[280:14.77]You're gonna start swimming in a second, so be careful.
[280:17.19]Got it!
[280:17.93]There you go!
[280:19.37]Look at that little guy.
[280:23.68]What is he?
[280:24.88]It's 13 pounds!
[280:26.74]What?!
[280:28.82]Why did that take so long?
[280:30.32]I was in the same spot as I was last time.
[280:31.88]The last fish I caught was right there.
[280:33.60]Get me the fuck out of here.
[280:46.60]All I had to do was walk?
[280:49.59]Yeah, well all I had to do was walk.
[280:50.95]Let's follow this guy.
[280:55.15]Fuck that guy.
[281:08.77]Oops.
[281:09.17]Hey, come back.
[281:10.25]I want to get back on the side.
[281:21.28]There we go.
[281:22.24]Yeah.
[281:25.75]Well, I had fun with the whole camp.
[281:30.23]Me?
[281:30.91]Yeah.
[281:32.09]Okay.
[281:32.33]That was mean.
[281:40.05]fishing rod.
[281:40.69]I wonder, can I just fish like this?
[281:45.05]I wonder.
[281:50.65]This guy can't hit me.
[281:53.58]Okay, I say that and he starts shooting the shit out of me.
[282:03.06]I was trying to do a takedown to them.
[282:04.42]You can't do a takedown on those guys.
[282:07.34]Okay, well that makes sense.
[282:29.74]Alright, let's do, like, another thing.
[282:32.50]Let's do something else.
[282:34.54]Like, instantly get shot by this helicopter?
[282:36.88]That sounds like fun.
[282:38.07]Can we grapple hook him?
[282:41.81]Just throw that into the cockpit.
[282:45.29]Did I?
[282:46.13]I was trying to.
[282:49.79]I want to grapple hook this guy.
[282:51.55]Can we bait him any more closer?
[282:54.88]Ow.
[282:58.18]Oh my lord, I can't do anything.
[283:04.28]Alright, I got some backup.
[283:07.04]He wants me bad.
[283:07.88]See if you can grab a hook onto him.
[283:08.84]He does want you bad.
[283:10.12]I'm going to try to pull him in here.
[283:10.92]Just wait.
[283:13.60]What was that?
[283:14.52]Help has arrived.
[283:16.85]Catch him!
[283:21.47]What happened?
[283:22.71]Oh, I'm doing the wing.
[283:23.73]I'm seeing it.
[283:25.13]Where am I?
[283:26.21]What?
[283:26.63]Okay, we're fine.
[283:29.44]Oh!
[283:31.30]Oh!
[283:33.60]Damn it.
[283:34.06]That was so close to being amazing.
[283:39.70]That wasn't a civilian, right?
[283:41.20]No, I think it wasn't.
[283:42.98]No, it wasn't.
[283:45.76]I mean, she's in camo and has the American flag wrapped around her neck.
[283:50.33]No.
[283:56.35]Yeah, no, probably a bad guy.
[283:57.63]Alright, let's go.
[283:59.83]Where do you want to go?
[284:01.63]Uh, how about we go down... I don't know.
[284:09.75]Let's go, like, up the river.
[284:11.60]You wanna just go up the river and see what the hell's up here?
[284:14.68]Yeah.
[284:15.26]Sounds like a plan.
[284:15.72]Where's the fishing rod?
[284:24.99]Do I not have it anymore?
[284:26.81]You need to hit Y. Oh.
[284:34.65]um the random explosions again so beautiful so pretty alright this thing is get I can't get rid of this save the game the game saves automatically we're good this is a modern video game made in the year 2018.
[285:10.56]Alright, we just moved into a new region.
[285:12.70]That looks like something.
[285:19.98]That does look like something.
[285:21.94]You know, you getting the same feeling that I'm getting over here?
[285:24.31]Is it an invisible wall, or is this a... Are those guys tailgating down here?
[285:29.91]What was that?
[285:30.75]Is this just a lake?
[285:32.07]It's either a lake, the invisible wall, or this is going to fall.
[285:40.75]There's like another purple shock trap over here.
[285:43.57]Where are we?
[285:44.91]Far away.
[285:45.89]Very far away.
[285:47.31]Okay.
[285:48.89]I guess I'll just go to the big smoking house across the lake.
[285:55.59]I like it.
[285:56.11]Imagine if we could just go into his house and shoot him.
[286:13.08]Did it work?
[286:14.46]Hold on, I'll take care of it.
[286:16.92]Don't feel so good.

[289:55.31]Could do stunts.
[289:56.29]Could do all kinds of stuff.
[289:57.41]Is there a jump right there?
[289:59.06]No.
[289:59.92]Not gonna do it.
[290:09.50]Tried.
[290:15.49]It's a plane, too.
[290:18.53]All kind of you.
[290:27.45]Now, this is a quest, so there will actually be a thing to do.
[290:30.28]Okay.
[290:32.34]I don't know what it'll be.
[290:33.54]Nice.
[290:34.86]Well, we've run out of water.
[290:38.06]We're basically here.
[290:39.74]Didn't we say we were going to try hard before we...
[290:42.56]I mean, we're here.
[290:43.38]Attempted to explode me on the jet ski?
[290:45.78]Why would I explode you on the jet ski?
[290:47.10]I'm here.
[290:47.92]We're fine.
[290:49.62]What are you talking about?
[290:53.47]Everything's fine.
[290:57.21]Okay.
[290:57.97]So, now we're here.
[290:59.51]How do we get up?
[291:02.01]Which we need to just go to... You're very... How are you that far away from me?
[291:09.34]You are very far away from me.
[291:11.12]Yeah, I'm just going around looking for a way to go up.
[291:20.43]Well, I got it.
[291:21.13]I got it here.
[291:21.71]I can see it.
[291:23.55]Where is he going?
[291:26.37]He was just nose diving.
[291:32.44]Yeah, I'm here.
[291:38.85]Is he going to go shoot the birds?
[291:40.47]What is he doing?
[291:41.39]He is freaking me out.
[291:44.39]I don't know, but it just started some kind of rock music.
[291:46.35]Yeah.
[291:54.46]I don't know what I'm... I don't understand what's happening.
[291:58.20]Should I come rescue you or you got it?
[291:59.80]I'm fine.
[292:00.26]I got it.
[292:00.58]Alright, good.
[292:03.02]I just apparently got turned around.
[292:06.24]But I'm here.
[292:10.14]The bad guys over there with you?
[292:11.20]I mean, yeah.
[292:11.92]There's a statue of a deer.
[292:16.44]There's so many people shooting me right now.
[292:18.21]And why did that thing not explode?
[292:19.27]Because you have to shoot it a lot.
[292:21.95]I did.
[292:27.74]Oh, you were on the other side.
[292:37.58]I got a lot of people over here.
[292:38.90]You can just come to me.
[292:42.96]He's about to come in from another strafe and run.
[292:45.58]We got that going for us.
[292:47.39]We're about to get run over also.
[292:51.85]I am.
[292:56.63]Not quite.
[292:58.30]Alright, what do we need to do here?
[293:01.88]I don't know.
[293:02.78]It's just a quest person.
[293:07.46]Alright, what's that?
[293:10.24]Is that a fishing quest?
[293:12.16]Is it really?
[293:13.79]Apparently something to do with a fishing rod.
[293:18.89]God damn it.
[293:19.67]Scare Dylan by shooting things around his RV.
[293:31.74]You gonna come out now?
[293:40.79]That's embarrassing.
[293:41.71]Did we do it?
[293:42.71]She's kind of run away now.
[293:46.63]Did she just go down?
[293:47.49]Okay, I thought she just went down like an elevator.
[293:49.49]Alright, we're good.
[293:52.14]Talk to Skylar.
[293:55.20]It is a fishing quest.
[293:58.02]Okay, let's go.
[293:59.28]We can go somewhere else.
[294:02.44]But like, what are the odds?
[294:03.54]Seriously, that the one quest that I pick off the map is a fishing quest.
[294:07.60]I mean, pretty rare.
[294:11.99]Wait, she said my magic word.
[294:15.30]It was.
[294:15.84]How did that miss?
[294:22.74]It didn't.
[294:23.00]Did that hit you?
[294:23.80]Yeah.
[294:23.92]Alright, talk to Skylar again.
[294:27.62]You want to fish?
[294:29.36]I mean, we're here.
[294:30.02]Might as well do it.
[294:31.20]Okay.
[294:31.80]Okay, I...
[294:42.88]Just talk to her.
[294:46.96]I can't.
[294:48.68]Oh my god, do we keep breaking missions?
[294:53.85]We do keep breaking missions.
[294:57.83]No, we did not.
[294:59.25]I think she... No, no, no, there we go.
[295:01.35]Good, good, good.
[295:01.89]We're fine.
[295:03.57]Follow Skylar.
[295:09.50]This used to be a Diana stream.
[295:11.02]It was?
[295:14.32]Get your rod out.
[295:19.46]She's like trying to give us fishing rods.
[295:21.36]It's like, no, ma'am.
[295:22.60]I've already brought my professional equipment.
[295:24.86]We already bought ours.
[295:26.05]Ours were $800.
[295:27.63]I got mine at Outworld.
[295:30.85]Outside.
[295:33.31]What are you trying to say?
[295:39.13]The fishing depot.
[295:41.81]What's the name of the big giant chain of fishing stores?
[295:47.94]Outworld?
[295:49.02]Outland?
[295:49.74]Now we're going to catch trout.
[295:55.14]Oh my god.
[295:57.98]I gave you an out.
[295:58.62]If we had to just get one, maybe.
[296:07.52]Does it count for both of us?
[296:10.18]It may.
[296:12.06]I don't see any fish right now.
[296:17.13]This is the tutorial.
[296:19.27]I think this is the fish tutorial, yeah.
[296:20.91]Yeah, this is like how to fish.
[296:22.45]Did you get one out of three?
[296:24.11]I'm getting one.
[296:25.24]I'm reeling it in.
[296:34.18]Coming to your side.
[296:36.06]It's all good.
[296:36.54]I'm trying to do this as fast as possible.
[296:40.10]I mean, that's usually the idea.
[296:41.48]But it did count one out of three for me.
[296:44.86]OK, we're done.
[296:47.44]So bad.
[296:51.28]Part two.
[296:52.94]Now what?
[296:53.82]Mission complete.
[297:07.11]What happened?
[297:07.89]What did you do?
[297:08.57]I accidentally right-clicked.
[297:09.83]I didn't even attack her.
[297:12.11]I didn't even attack her.
[297:18.15]I thought that was a huge... It's like 1600s British rifle she pulled out.
[297:23.53]I thought that was a very long bayonet.
[297:28.09]I might be tired.
[297:28.85]Do it again.
[297:32.79]No!
[297:33.31]What?
[297:33.83]No, good idea.
[297:34.49]Don't do it again.
[297:35.34]No.
[297:36.14]Next.
[297:37.98]We're moving on.
[297:39.54]There's a whole new world up here that we haven't explored yet in Cigarette Bay.
[297:48.63]I might need to take a break here in the next 10, 15.
[297:52.19]That's fine.
[297:55.07]Let's do one more high-octane mission.
[297:57.93]We can't end on sleepy fish.
[297:59.66]No, we can't end on sleepy fish.
[298:00.80]We're going to end on super fun.
[298:05.46]Watch this.
[298:05.80]I'm going to punch this guy off.
[298:07.92]Alright, let's do the bear quest.
[298:13.41]Let's do the bear quest.
[298:14.37]It's very far away.
[298:15.73]Is it very far away?
[298:17.85]It's the bear quest.
[298:18.89]It's Cheeseburger the Bear.
[298:21.65]Okay.
[298:24.08]That's going to be the one.
[298:25.90]Gas station?
[298:28.48]Gas station?
[298:32.70]That is a gas station.
[298:33.50]You know what to do.
[298:34.24]You know what to do.
[298:34.92]Come on.
[298:37.36]Excellent.
[298:39.70]Excellent.
[298:43.79]I want, like, a different rifle.
[298:47.57]Maybe I shouldn't have spent all my money on a fishing rod.
[298:53.77]You're supposed to be able to talk to the vendors and sell them them.
[298:56.83]Well, we'll get a plane.
[298:58.77]I don't know where our plane is.
[299:01.85]We need to find a garage.
[299:03.67]Can we mark a garage?
[299:07.37]Can you get that on your legend or something?
[299:09.69]I mean, we haven't been... This is new territory.
[299:12.93]So... We haven't discovered anything here yet.
[299:17.49]I guess you're right.
[299:24.75]There's stuff all over the place, though.
[299:26.01]There's, uh... Gray wolf hunting.
[299:29.96]There's really loud action music.
[299:32.38]Yeah, there is.
[299:35.06]And a lot of statuettes of deer.
[299:38.46]Quite a few of them.
[299:41.25]I was thinking, well, a bear just kind of came out of nowhere.
[299:43.89]We're in bear country, I guess.
[299:49.69]There's a lot fewer crazy NPCs here.
[299:54.47]Yes, there are.
[299:56.17]I think we're supposed to destroy that.
[299:58.31]And that's a flaming buffalo.
[299:59.11]That was a buffalo.
[300:02.75]More or less... less crazy NPCs.
[300:05.63]Never mind.
[300:06.19]I think there's more crazy... Animals.
[300:09.47]...drive by free to hostage.
[300:25.16]Still got a camping trip going on ahead.
[300:27.79]Doing a convoy.
[300:30.89]And that guy has been staked to a sign.
[300:34.37]That's not good.
[300:42.92]You're almost there, buddy.
[300:44.08]I am hydrating.
[300:45.38]I just drank some water.
[300:51.90]Are you being told to drink water?
[300:53.98]I just was, yeah.
[300:55.14]What is that?
[300:55.90]Who's shooting over to the right?
[300:58.48]Oh, I don't see anybody.
[301:00.76]There's like a crazed gun maniac over there.
[301:04.06]Go, go, go.
[301:04.81]Turn around, turn around.
[301:05.99]No, it's too late.
[301:07.49]That was a worthwhile investigation.
[301:09.49]Well, what about this guy?
[301:10.85]Well... This dog has Christmas lights on him.
[301:19.51]Okay.
[301:27.58]Hold on Alright, I'm good I wish you could drive the school bus.
[301:32.15]Alright, I gotta check.
[301:32.95]I just gotta look He may be gone now
[301:46.19]But there's something happening over here.
[301:49.75]What's happening?
[301:50.37]I mean, listen.
[301:52.74]I mean, there is somebody just shooting a machine.
[301:55.58]They're shooting bears.
[302:00.06]This is an animal fight.
[302:01.54]It's a people versus animals fight.
[302:02.86]There's like six animals.
[302:04.96]I don't know what they're shooting at.
[302:06.10]They're shooting in the air.
[302:15.27]I'm just gonna watch.
[302:17.19]Yeah.
[302:17.79]I mean, that's really all you can do.
[302:19.05]Is it a bear versus bear versus person?
[302:20.97]There's two bears.
[302:22.37]Two people with heavy machine guns.
[302:24.53]Actually, it's a bear versus bear.
[302:26.52]Yes, there's a bear versus bear fight going on.
[302:29.46]So then... Monster Hunter: World sequel.
[302:31.18]That guy just tried to melee the bear.
[302:37.20]And there he goes.
[302:37.92]Bye.
[302:41.45]And now they're shooting at us.
[302:43.07]And they're very, very much shooting at us.
[302:48.18]That hurts a lot.
[302:50.64]I'm gonna die.
[302:52.48]No, don't die.
[302:53.04]Don't die.
[302:53.58]I'm trying to not.
[302:54.90]I'm trying.
[302:55.64]The fucking bear is over here.
[302:57.06]Did I just see a bear?
[302:58.67]Don't rescue me until you heal.
[303:00.73]I'm gonna sit here.
[303:02.97]I got time.
[303:05.35]We gotta get those machine guns.
[303:07.75]That's the high-octane finish that we need.
[303:09.78]Okay, I'm coming.
[303:10.34]I thought I had grenades equipped.
[303:15.04]I had C4.
[303:17.85]Okay, just sprint straight for it.
[303:20.44]Okay, none of those bullets hit.
[303:21.52]I don't know how.
[303:28.56]I could just give up and spawn on you.
[303:29.80]Would that be easier?
[303:30.84]You know, probably.
[303:31.52]One of them's dead.
[303:32.24]Do you want me to... Just spawn on me.
[303:36.47]I think he's going to brain hell on him anyways.
[303:39.91]Can the guy in the plane resurrect me?
[303:41.41]That'd be great.
[303:46.30]Alright, I don't... I don't understand how... I honestly don't get it.
[303:50.24]I think they have super body armor machine gun guards.
[303:54.00]I literally shot the guy fucking, like, spot on, like, 15 times.
[304:06.20]20 second countdown.
[304:10.29]He's dead.
[304:13.34]I think this thing's just an inaccurate piece of shit from, like, that far away.
[304:19.47]Alright, well, uh, I don't think they have any guns that were worth picking up.
[304:24.97]I guess the Edu is one.
[304:26.31]They had the super machine gun.
[304:27.87]Yeah, he does.
[304:28.35]Where's the other one?
[304:30.83]I got the other one.
[304:34.07]What?
[304:34.31]Is this, like, a mine on the ground?
[304:37.91]Yeah, I tried to throw that at him.
[304:40.07]Is this bear alive?
[304:43.84]This one's not.
[304:44.70]That's a bison, though.
[304:45.82]No, but that one was just standing up.
[304:47.78]Alright, where's that other gun?
[304:55.70]His super machine gun.
[304:56.72]Alright, this does not... Move this out of the way, please.
[305:05.72]There it is.
[305:06.93]Okay, I have an LMG now.
[305:09.33]Who are you... What is she doing here again?
[305:14.47]He just wanted to tag along, man.
[305:15.85]He just wants to hang out.
[305:21.09]Alright, let's get a... Let's do the bear quest.
[305:23.67]Let's get back to it.
[305:24.34]I think it was worth getting these weapons.
[305:27.64]Probably, yeah.
[305:29.18]I'm tired of shooting that same assault rifle.
[305:32.24]Where's the Jeep?
[305:32.80]Oh, here it is.
[305:34.14]It's just hanging out over there.
[305:38.79]Hi, Diana.
[305:39.27]Bye, Diana.
[305:39.61]Good to see you.
[305:40.93]She'll be back.
[305:42.09]She's always back.
[305:43.17]Yeah, she's back with a high-octane mission.
[305:46.21]The grand finale.
[305:46.95]Alright, everyone.
[305:50.69]Watch my back.
[306:02.92]That's good.
[306:03.42]We're good.
[306:05.14]Watch my back.
[306:06.04]Hey.
[306:07.70]Uh, actually watch my back.
[306:11.44]Oh, okay.
[306:15.06]Why are they so much faster?
[306:17.42]That guy just went into the driver's seat, really.
[306:21.52]Is Diana in a car?
[306:22.44]She's sprinting after us.
[306:25.97]God.
[306:27.03]And comms talking us the whole time.
[306:35.11]Alright, we're here.
[306:36.70]Alright.
[306:37.60]We're at the zoo.
[306:38.60]Getting ready to see the scones.
[306:41.64]Oh, no.
[306:42.14]Alright.
[306:47.22]We're here.
[306:48.98]Let's liberate.
[306:51.18]Locked.
[307:06.12]Did you find a secret entrance?
[307:07.24]No, we don't have very stealthy weapons.
[307:08.68]Wait, can you pick that?
[307:10.14]I think you just attracted everybody by punching the wall.
[307:17.44]It's okay, just get on the roof.
[307:18.70]Oh my god, yep.
[307:21.19]By punching the wall.
[307:22.83]You punched the wall and you attracted the whole entire camp.
[307:27.45]I'm gonna die.
[307:28.85]Are you?
[307:29.81]I'm just gonna have to hide here.
[307:36.14]Are you serious?
[307:37.57]How did you get around the corner?
[307:40.73]You fucking... I don't think I can shoot through that.
[307:47.91]Fucking mankind.
[307:53.35]And I'm good.
[307:53.75]These guys are like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
[308:09.34]Where did he go?
[308:10.12]Okay.
[308:10.42]Alright, we gotta get the bear.
[308:13.14]We're gonna release the bear.
[308:16.72]Well, whatever that may be.
[308:17.80]We got some more company over here.
[308:22.46]I'll take care of it.
[308:24.76]Taking care of it.
[308:27.82]Whoa!
[308:29.06]That's a helicopter.
[308:30.30]That's loud.
[308:31.13]That's very loud.
[308:37.01]We got it.
[308:38.19]There we go.
[308:40.29]When you get to that screen, does it make your mouse sensitivity like a thousand times?
[308:44.75]No, only like actually slow.
[308:49.59]There's your high octane finish.
[308:51.23]That was, yeah.
[308:52.09]We had a helicopter crash.
[308:53.23]I got to detonate.
[308:56.43]Now we're going to do some painting, you know?
[308:57.97]Now we're going to clean the place up.
[309:03.40]Great work, Deputy.
[309:04.88]The court won't be training judges at the Fang Center anymore.
[309:08.52]Good lesson from you.
[309:09.60]Mm-hmm.
[309:13.54]Where's the bear, though?
[309:16.03]I don't know.
[309:17.35]We're at the zoo.
[309:19.11]Oh, I found them.
[309:23.15]They're in here.
[309:23.55]There's a lot of them, actually.
[309:24.93]There's like seven bears in here to choose from.
[309:29.11]Oh, you got in too early.
[309:38.62]People said to use this earlier, didn't they?
[309:42.02]This is a callback from way earlier in the stream.
[309:44.73]Yeah.
[309:45.57]Come here.
[309:46.47]Hold on.
[309:49.71]Callback?
[309:50.87]Yeah, this is a callback.
[309:52.33]Am I supposed to come in?
[309:53.61]Yeah, you're supposed to come in.
[310:00.58]Oh, alright.
[310:01.88]They said, this is how you do it.
[310:05.40]They were right.
[310:05.88]Yeah, they were right.
[310:11.33]40 silver bars.
[310:13.87]Interesting.
[310:16.95]And literally right when we did that, my internet is dying.
[310:21.81]Oh, really?
[310:22.41]Well, convenient timing, I guess.
[310:24.97]Perfect timing, huh?
[310:27.52]Yeah.
[310:27.64]Could have been a lot worse.
[310:29.56]That's good.
[310:29.92]It's been five hours.
[310:30.84]That's good.
[310:34.02]Stream is pre-recorded.
[310:36.72]Internet's dying here.
[310:41.16]That's so funny how that's literally at the exact moment when the stream is over.
[310:45.44]Yeah, pretty much.
[310:49.30]Wow.
[310:50.06]Why can you put a scope that big on a revolver?
[310:57.48]Yeah, I'm looking over right now.
[310:59.78]I can see it hurting.
[311:02.90]I'm down into yellow right now.
[311:05.58]It was green the whole stream.
[311:11.81]Alright, well.
[311:12.55]There's Far Cry 5.
[311:16.25]That was pretty fun.
[311:19.43]There was a lot going on.
[311:21.79]I thought you were a bad guy.
[311:31.60]Well, that's what you get.
[311:33.88]For hurting Diana?
[311:36.13]Well, I think Diana's perma-dead now.
[311:37.55]Oh yeah, she is.
[311:38.97]You helped.
[311:39.93]You definitely contributed to that.
[311:41.89]I'll take care of it.
[311:43.77]Where are you taking her?
[311:54.76]Just into the middle of the road so a car can run over her head.
[311:58.72]What?
[311:58.98]No, Jeremy, Jesus.
[312:00.28]No, don't, what are you?
[312:03.80]Jeremy.
[312:20.31]What a psycho.
[312:23.59]Did you just bring her back?
[312:25.57]Wait, you brought her back, she's right here.
[312:29.16]Did you just respawn her?
[312:31.08]Yes, you did.
[312:34.47]She's unkillable, okay.
[312:44.93]That's so painful, Logan.
[312:47.01]Oh, that's so painful.
[312:51.18]I fucking missed him.
[312:56.62]Like, this is the easy joke that we waited till the end of this stream to do.
[313:00.74]This is the easiest joke.
[313:01.86]Alright, hold on.
[313:02.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[313:02.76]You gotta... We gotta find somebody.
[313:04.74]And I need to take... I need to zoom in with a picture.
[313:07.00]Alright, this guy... No, this guy's not gonna ragdoll.
[313:12.09]He's not gonna die.
[313:13.37]Where did my... Where did my melee go, though?
[313:19.60]You got that guy in the teeth, directly in his mouth.
[313:24.47]Where did you come from?
[313:26.43]What?
[313:28.07]This bear was just in the house.
[313:29.93]Hi, so the joke earlier, when you were taking her body, I called the bears in.
[313:36.32]What do you mean you called the bears in?
[313:39.12]I mean, if you... Oh, so he did get you.
[313:41.58]Alright, mission accomplished.
[313:44.41]So, like, if you open up your queue menu and go to the number seven, you can scroll wheel and you can get meat to lure animals.
[313:57.08]It's on me.
[313:58.08]Really?
[313:58.40]Alright.
[314:00.38]I've had enough.
[314:02.22]Ow.
[314:03.93]Okay.
[314:04.47]So, we need to find just a random person for you to do that to.
[314:08.69]I have to do that.
[314:09.33]I need to see that.
[314:10.47]Why are there people in this car?
[314:13.16]Somebody did run her head over.
[314:14.32]Okay.
[314:16.84]Interesting.
[314:19.88]Prophecy that was foretold.
[314:21.34]The promise.
[314:24.16]Alright, we got anybody down here?
[314:27.13]There's got to be a train if there's train tracks, right?
[314:29.71]I don't know.
[314:30.09]Like the Chekhov's gun.
[314:33.25]Why are all these people dead?
[314:34.91]Here we go.
[314:35.45]We got the perfect opportunity.
[314:37.95]This guy right here.
[314:39.87]This is a bad guy.
[314:40.95]Did you get a good shot?
[314:45.83]I mean, not really, but you got another opportunity.
[314:48.17]Hold on.
[314:48.47]Are you fucking with me, mister?
[314:59.93]I'm sorry, dog.
[315:00.83]I didn't mean to kill your master.
[315:03.01]Oh, no.
[315:12.71]Okay, you have to see that.
[315:14.43]That's too funny.
[315:17.43]You fucking with me?
[315:20.77]Sorry, dog.
[315:22.55]Alright, you need to see what that looks like.
[315:23.93]It looks very, very... It's just super comical.
[315:26.15]You need to see it.
[315:30.59]You fucking with me?
[315:34.23]What is that?
[315:35.49]Why is there like a wolverine?
[315:45.36]Why?
[315:46.42]You have to kill that before we both die.
[315:50.06]No.
[315:51.00]Why is it so strong?
[315:52.79]You're gonna die.
[315:53.41]Why?
[315:55.79]Why?
[315:56.15]I hit it at least 15 times.
[316:05.37]That's the only animal I think that can take a baseball bat to its skull.
[316:08.83]25 times.
[316:10.63]I think she can steal pipes.
[316:14.29]Ay, ay, ay.
[316:15.27]That's a honey badger.
[316:16.57]My stomach is, like, killing me right now.
[316:20.63]Okay, you need to see.
[316:21.65]You gotta zoom in on somebody, like, chest up.
[316:28.56]Like this dude right here.
[316:29.46]Just zoom in on this guy.
[316:30.50]Take off the HUD.
[316:31.24]Chest up.
[316:31.84]Make sure he's looking.
[316:32.52]Like, get it from, like, this direction.
[316:37.02]You got it?
[316:39.54]I got it.
[316:40.32]Wait until he says something.
[316:41.28]Please!
[316:43.80]I feel like the pipe makes a funnier, like the metal objects make like a funnier noise.
[316:51.01]Maybe, I don't know.
[316:52.23]Here, watch.
[316:55.51]Ulster, your weapon, bud.
[316:56.85]Just the, ding.
[316:57.81]Yeah, that like, ding.
[317:00.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[317:09.83]Do you want me to do, wait, hold on.
[317:14.32]It's funny when they're facing us.
[317:18.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[317:19.44]Let me turn this way.
[317:30.90]He's not a ragdoller.
[317:32.70]He's just a... He's just a pick-me-up.
[317:37.00]Someone's firing.
[317:38.32]Okay, no, we gotta get another one.
[317:42.45]I'm just your camera following you around right now.
[317:44.95]We're trying to get a shot for the upcoming documentary.
[317:48.59]Is this person... Is this one... We got one here?
[317:50.91]Dude, she's very angry-looking.
[317:57.68]How's it going, mister?
[317:58.60]Hey, sir!
[317:59.32]What?
[318:05.96]Alright, and on that note, that's been Far Cry 5.
[318:09.46]It's been fun.
[318:12.64]You want me to throw one at somebody?
[318:14.62]Let me see a pipe.
[318:15.66]Let me see the pipe.
[318:16.64]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[318:17.48]Wait, what are you doing?
[318:22.52]What?!
[318:23.98]You did not actually just do that, did you?
[318:26.29]First try!
[318:27.49]You did not just throw that into the fucking straight in the air and hit him right in the head, did you?
[318:30.51]I can't believe it.
[318:32.25]Unbelievable.
[318:32.73]Take one!
[318:34.01]Cut!
[318:35.39]Un-fucking-believable.
[318:41.43]Wow.
[318:43.07]That was something else.
[318:44.83]Can you do it again?
[318:46.33]What do you mean, can I do it again?
[318:48.79]Can lightning strike the same place twice?
[318:50.81]I mean, you just did it once.
[318:59.02]Oh, it's worth it.
[318:59.70]It's worth it.
[319:00.10]It is.
[319:00.34]No, it is.
[319:03.78]I know, but she's going up the ladder.
[319:04.84]She's currently going up the ladder.
[319:05.74]Do it from the top of the ladder.
[319:09.30]Oh!
[319:10.57]Dude, that was so close.
[319:19.23]You can do this you could I have I got faith in you you are such a high quality game on the first try No, you are such a highly skilled gamer.
[319:26.89]I'm certain you can do this.
[319:28.61]I can't climb up this you won't move This is a ladder that doesn't work.
[319:32.33]Oh, no
[319:34.31]Oh, no.
[319:34.71]I have to get on top to collect my pipes.
[319:37.77]Oh, dude.
[319:38.37]Her stupid AI pathing just goes up the ladder.
[319:41.53]You wait till that she's gone.
[319:42.53]If that hits her directly in the face coming up the ladder, you might lose me.
[319:46.33]I might be gone forever.
[319:49.73]It's possible that I might be gone forever if I get that.
[319:51.90]She stopped.
[319:53.96]She was gonna walk there.
[319:59.30]And she turned around.
[320:00.44]She's gotta be going up the ladder.
[320:02.91]Like, walking up the ladder.
[320:04.43]Oh, come on.
[320:09.33]How is that not... Oh, it's so close.
[320:11.45]I got this.
[320:19.75]Why are you stopping?
[320:20.67]Just keep... Just mind your own business.
[320:22.35]You hear that?
[320:32.05]Why does it hurt so much?
[320:35.61]There.
[320:35.79]There.
[320:37.03]That's all I got, okay?
[320:38.67]Took a couple tries, but I got the, do you hear something?
[320:42.30]Right before getting hit in the head.
[320:44.84]Like, that's the quality.
[320:45.88]There you go.
[320:47.36]Hey, do you hear something?
[320:49.30]And the stage light just falls on her head.
[320:53.18]Oh, man.
[320:54.42]Oh, my God.
[320:55.10]That's so fucking funny.
[321:00.71]so much you gotta do it one more time one I don't think they can I can't get off I can't get enough to be a default NPC because otherwise they're just gonna collapse we can't do it on like the marker to npcs because you know you're right you're right you're right alright we gotta find somebody I have like a wicked fat stomach ache now I don't we're gonna have to like okay I got an idea
[321:26.33]Can we fast travel to an outpost we've already captured and there will be new NPCs there?
[321:31.53]Possibly.
[321:35.61]Did you hear that?
[321:36.43]Did you hear something?
[321:45.07]Yo, wicked.
[321:46.01]Can you imagine if someone was climbing up the ladder and hit him directly in the mouth?
[321:55.43]Alright, we got... I think it's funnier at night, but here we are.
[321:57.69]Well, it's easier to see during the day, though.
[322:00.65]Alright, we got this guy here.
[322:01.59]I don't think this guy moves, though.
[322:03.25]You can't have an icon.
[322:04.91]Oh, you cannot have an icon.
[322:06.01]Okay.
[322:06.69]I don't think he does, actually.
[322:08.60]Does he not have an icon?
[322:12.74]Let me get from... We can make this legit here.
[322:17.14]I feel like it's funnier when they're moving.
[322:19.94]Maybe, but...
[322:24.33]Because if I can see the whole arc... Where are you right now?
[322:27.17]I'm just looking around to see if there's any other NPCs in here.
[322:30.21]He's waving at me.
[322:32.13]It's like the only one.
[322:32.89]Alright, try to get this guy.
[322:35.06]I want to see if I can see it coming down at him in the head.
[322:36.78]I can see you in the bottom.
[322:45.08]A little short.
[322:50.79]A little short.
[322:51.33]A little short.
[322:59.15]Come on, really?
[323:00.27]I think, I'm not sure it shows in fall.
[323:02.85]I think the wind's catching it.
[323:06.93]That's gonna be too far.
[323:10.73]What?
[323:11.99]Okay, that, yeah, alright.
[323:13.33]That was, that was some, some, uh, some magic shit there.
[323:17.33]Did you not see the pipe come down?
[323:19.03]I watched the pipe go up, and then he fell down when it was in the air.
[323:22.84]Oh.
[323:23.36]But could you see the pipes before?
[323:25.32]I saw the, uh, the first time.
[323:26.58]Like on the other lady?
[323:27.40]Yeah.
[323:31.21]Can I do it to myself?
[323:40.10]Uh, no.
[323:41.20]Damn it, that's too bad.
[323:43.26]The bat goes way higher than the pipe.
[323:47.98]Aww.
[323:49.44]Alright, well, that was fucking funny.
[323:52.48]I feel like we got the joke.
[323:53.76]Yeah, no, that was fucking hilarious.
[323:56.68]That lady.
[323:58.59]It was a good ending note.
[323:59.76]yeah and on that um always a pleasure Etalyx I don't know how I don't know how we're doing with this whole thing how we're doing with um Far Cry 5 you maybe play it again I don't know what do you think how do you feel yeah yeah yeah probably so alright well let's um I mean I I'm having fun
[324:30.13]Let me get this one.
[324:30.65]Let me get this one.
[324:33.25]Do the throw.
[324:34.45]Okay, fine.
[324:34.99]I'll throw it at this guy's head.
[324:38.23]He went very far.
[324:40.67]Uh, he's right here for me.
[324:42.88]You, like, knocked his feet out from under him.
[324:48.60]What is that?
[324:49.30]Hit the eagle with the bat.
[324:51.20]Watch this.
[324:53.04]No way.
[324:54.20]Oh, that was kind of close.
[324:56.06]I could have been, if I was any good.
[325:02.11]Alright, I'm gonna turn on the stream.
[325:06.43]Alright, well, that was fun.
[325:08.85]Thanks for watching.
[325:10.03]I feel like best Far Cry so far?
[325:13.76]No, that was very enjoyable.
[325:17.04]Best Far Cry since 3 maybe?
[325:18.72]All of the weird shit makes it fun.
[325:22.79]I had more fun than Primal, more fun than 4 for sure.
[325:27.01]Yeah.
[325:28.03]We'll talk to you soon, Etalyx.
[325:29.53]Bye-bye, Etalyx's stream.
[325:31.13]We'll continue with that.
[325:32.11]Bye-bye, Jerma.
[325:33.77]And stream.
[325:34.81]Thanks for playing, Etalyx.
[325:35.95]Kisses.
[325:36.71]Love you.
[325:37.25]Bye.
[325:37.67]Alright.
[325:41.82]Well, that was... This was fun.
[325:48.20]I feel like there's...
[325:50.22]enough to do but maybe it depends on the story missions but if the story missions are as interesting later as well then yeah this is worth playing it's pretty typical the story is pretty much the same story you've seen every other video game religious cult needs to be stopped and there's a bunch of scripture and they say all kinds of prayers and they're cultists
[326:19.92]But I mean, what are you going to do, right?
[326:24.12]Anyways.
[326:26.32]Yeah, progress does not save for me.
[326:29.58]So I have about five hours and 20 minutes in Far Cry 5 that the only way I can progress is if I play with Etalyx.
[326:39.22]So that kind of sucks.
[326:42.12]But in the same realm, it's all good.
[326:45.18]It doesn't matter.
[326:47.38]It's good to go.
[326:49.70]There isn't a whole lot of cutscenes and backstory going on compared to Far Cry 3.
[326:55.41]Actually, I didn't play very much of the other Far Cries.
[326:59.81]I played Far Cry 4.
[327:02.32]And maybe a little bit of Far Cry 2 or 3.
[327:05.24]I've never played the original Far Cry.
[327:09.54]But I do agree, the whole thing where it doesn't save for both people is really, really stupid.
[327:14.43]There's no way they can somehow unlock that.
[327:18.06]I don't know.
[327:19.26]There's probably some weird wall there that you can't cross for some dumb reason.
[327:24.86]But let's do the credits.
[327:26.77]Thank you, everybody, if you're taking off now.
[327:28.39]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[327:31.39]Got some interesting streams coming this week.
[327:35.19]Especially the end of the week.
[327:38.64]If you didn't hear this weekend, you...
[327:42.18]There's going to be some interesting things going on.
[327:45.82]With that, I will see you later.
[327:48.88]If you're leaving, take care.
[327:50.86]Always a pleasure.
[327:51.62]Always a pleasure having you here.

[331:10.00]Hello.
[331:10.22]Hi 3d red.
[331:11.26]Thank you for your donation here Flop a gun.
[331:14.79]Thanks for the $1.
[331:15.57]Hi Jerma Wow, we're on the top of the Far Cry games.
[331:17.83]Have you done any research into Far Cry 1?
[331:20.25]That I suggested a couple weeks ago
[331:23.32]All I know is that I'm probably going to play it.
[331:25.34]I don't know when, but I probably will.
[331:27.44]It looks like it's going to be interesting enough to play it on stream.
[331:30.61]So, just not anytime very soon.
[331:35.21]Maybe kind of soon.
[331:37.37]But thanks, dude.
[331:39.77]Poseidon.
[331:41.55]Poseidon.
[331:42.27]Thanks for the one dollar.
[331:43.10]My first Jerma stream.
[331:43.90]I've been a fan for so long.
[331:44.88]It's cool to see you.
[331:45.72]Thanks, man.
[331:46.04]Welcome to the stream.
[331:47.36]Good to see you.
[331:49.37]Poseidon, again for the $1, I accidentally bought 300 bits.
[331:54.65]Well, I will accidentally take two of those dollars at this moment, thank you.
[332:01.48]Appreciate it, dude.
[332:03.10]Sorry you accidentally bought some that you didn't want.
[332:08.10]Prime Vino, thanks for the $5, can you help me on my trig homework?
[332:13.36]I failed geometry when I was in math, so... I failed like the... I couldn't even do Algebra 1 Part 1.
[332:20.77]So, I don't think I can help you.
[332:22.07]I'm sorry.
[332:22.92]Thank you for the $5, though.
[332:26.29]Treefitty1992, thanks for the one dollar.
[332:28.55]Well, he just gave me a dollar.
[332:51.11]So if you need that, you gave me a dollar, then you need more than that now.
[332:53.99]Thanks, dude.
[332:55.81]Thank you for watching.
[333:00.05]Stick around.
[333:02.61]Hopefully there's more to see.
[333:04.75]What else we got here?
[333:07.55]Uh... Pocky... Pocky... Caudillo.
[333:14.41]Your name, I'm gonna... I'm sorry I just said that completely incorrectly.
[333:18.17]But thanks for the five dollars, dude.
[333:20.64]I drank 31 beers at 11 a.m.
[333:22.88]today.
[333:23.16]I feel awful, but your stream makes me feel less awful.
[333:27.18]Also, my name is Pochi.
[333:29.44]Pochi, okay.
[333:32.60]You drank more than a 30 rack.
[333:35.88]Are you like 9 feet tall?
[333:40.40]Hold on.
[333:40.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[333:42.14]So you were drinking at 11 a.m.?
[333:46.68]That's like Andre the Giant type drinking, man.
[333:50.42]Damn.
[333:51.69]Be careful.
[333:54.25]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[333:57.91]How is he alive?
[333:59.09]It's come to my attention that people think I'm RPing as Garfield.
[334:01.73]I googled RP and I got Renaissance Periodization.
[334:06.59]It's some kind of workout regimen.
[334:08.07]I don't know where y'all got the impression because I thought I was famous for my lack of exercise, you crazy kids.
[334:13.20]Jeremy, talk some sense into some of these kittens.
[334:15.84]Anyway, enjoy the dubloons.
[334:18.91]Thank you, Garfield.
[334:19.59]Appreciate it, man.
[334:21.13]Welcome back.
[334:23.09]Indiana500, thanks for the 500 bits.
[334:24.81]Pretty self-explanatory there, I guess.
[334:27.63]Thank you.
[334:29.23]Also, another dollar there from Indiana500.
[334:31.21]Thank you.
[334:33.31]For the six dollars total.
[334:36.73]TreeFitty, again, thanks for the 25 cents.
[334:38.59]It has come to my attention that my previous bits were donated by a mythical creature that I have been hunting for years.
[334:44.30]If you see him again, Jerry, capture him.
[334:51.38]Will do.
[334:52.04]Thank you.
[334:53.89]Jesterobo, thanks for the $1.
[334:55.91]Vincessity, thanks for the $1.
[334:58.45]Vinesauce played an Android game titled Jerma, and it was actually a porn game.
[335:03.03]I'm not even joking.
[335:03.77]I actually saw that.
[335:07.07]I had nothing to do with that.
[335:09.40]But I did see the thing you were referring to.
[335:13.48]Sorry, Vinny, if you're watching.
[335:15.22]I had nothing to do with that one.
[335:18.32]If you end up seeing this at some point, thank you for that.
[335:20.98]Thank you for the 25 cents, 3D Red.
[335:22.98]Thank you.
[335:23.44]It was great to unlock that.
[335:46.62]Porn game?
[335:47.24]Yeah, it... Somebody, like... I'm not sure who Vinny was.
[335:52.44]I think Vinny was playing, like, Android?
[335:54.97]App Store games, maybe?
[335:56.11]I have no idea.
[335:56.79]And one of them was called Jerma that he downloaded.
[336:01.81]And it was just... It was just bait to get him to open it or something.
[336:08.02]I do not recommend you go look into that.
[336:10.64]But... Can't stop you, though.
[336:14.74]Um, thank you to PixelInferno for the 50 cents.
[336:18.42]Forehead.
[336:18.84]Thank you.
[336:20.86]Samuel Sish, thanks for the one dollar.
[336:23.12]They say, blubba-lubba-dab-dab.
[336:25.98]Combining two awful things together.
[336:29.06]Appreciate it, dude.
[336:31.58]Thank you, CigaretteSpaghetti gave 25 dollars earlier.
[336:35.55]Thank you, CigaretteSpaghetti.
[336:38.25]25 bucks.
[336:39.35]Complete video game using only thrown shovel.
[336:46.89]But now I understand why it's so powerful.
[336:48.78]Maybe.
[336:50.26]Maybe.
[336:52.34]Maybe we can continue to play it.
[336:55.40]Which is not a question entirely.
[336:56.62]Do you guys want to continue to see Far Cry 5?
[337:02.31]Or do you not want to see it again?
[337:04.47]What do you think?
[337:06.77]Can we play this again on Thursday?
[337:08.05]Or should I play it again soon?
[337:09.21]Or should we move on to something else?
[337:19.75]Yep.
[337:22.94]Maybe one more time.
[337:27.16]Maybe I'll see what he's doing on Thursday, see if we can do it again.
[337:30.78]Because I can't play the game unless I play with him.
[337:34.58]Monster Rancher 3 is coming, don't worry.
[337:37.25]You'll see Monster Rancher 3 next week.
[337:41.33]So, I would say, like, exactly one week from today, or maybe on, like, this, you know, a week from this Thursday, next week, we'll probably do Monster Rancher 3.
[337:51.28]Don't worry, you'll see it.
[337:53.18]I can't wait to play it.
[337:56.54]Hey, Monty the Moose, thanks for the $1.
[337:58.40]Hi, I'm here for Big Slick Rick's Big Slick Big Slick Dick.
[338:03.00]Am I in the right spot?
[338:07.14]I'm not sure.
[338:07.58]Maybe you might have taken a wrong turn.
[338:09.06]Thanks, man.
[338:11.45]Also, thank you to Monty the Moose again for the $1 here.
[338:14.44]I love how calm and quiet chat is being right now.
[338:16.56]By the way, religion is a sham and God isn't real.
[338:23.29]Okay.
[338:24.81]Thank you for the $1.
[338:27.73]Thank you, Hawkeye of mine, for the $15.
[338:31.62]I just got a new job as a tech repairman, and on my first day, despite only being only a third of the way through training, I fixed two laptops and a phone.
[338:41.67]Here's some of the spoils to come, and thanks for the seven years of perfect laps.
[338:47.51]Well, congratulations on the new job there, hot guy of mine.
[338:50.41]Well, you're not even a third of the way through training, and you're already making strides.
[338:58.92]But keep this in mind, you don't have to give me a percentage of your income.
[339:04.24]You know what I mean?
[339:04.72]Like, hey, take some of the spoils, Jerma.
[339:09.06]I appreciate the $15 nonetheless, but you don't have to worry about giving me a percentage of your check.
[339:17.75]Thank you so much, though, dude.
[339:19.11]And you've been around for seven years?
[339:21.25]That's a fucking long time.
[339:30.03]The 30% of proceedings, I must be paid?
[339:33.11]Do you have a tax?
[339:36.45]God.
[339:36.79]No, there's no tax.
[339:45.94]Wait, you mean I don't have to pay the streamer tax?
[339:48.14]You don't have to pay the streamer tax.
[339:54.12]But congratulations again, Hawkeye.
[339:56.75]I hope you move up in that company.
[339:57.97]I hope you take over that company.
[339:59.89]I hope you run the fucking show.
[340:02.01]And you can, like, point at shit and, like, say, like, you do that.
[340:04.40]And just go in the back room and just, like, count the stacks of money that you got.
[340:11.92]Thank you, dude.
[340:14.46]Thank you, Garfield, again.
[340:15.47]Garfield, the Monday Killer, for the 25 cents.
[340:17.55]Jeremy, it appears as if I have gotten pneumonia.
[340:20.45]Not to worry, though.
[340:21.05]I don't feel too sick.
[340:22.69]Liz, the vet, said it was thanks to all your streams.
[340:25.33]Gotta lay off the lasagna for a while, and that's just the way it is.
[340:27.95]Wish me luck that I don't die or whatever.
[340:31.74]Thank you, Ghoul Champ, for the $5.
[340:33.24]Epic Gamer Moments 2005.
[340:35.90]Thank you, Ghoul Champ.
[340:40.70]There were a couple of gamer moments.
[340:44.79]Uh, Targe Tape, thanks for the 25 cents.
[340:46.83]Me, Caveman.
[340:47.61]Jerma, good bazooka.
[340:48.59]Joe, bad.
[340:49.27]Me, smash rat with club.
[340:52.94]Wonderful phone, thanks for the 25 cents.
[340:55.72]Fuck you, John.
[340:56.68]I don't know why they're saying that, but they are.
[341:01.40]Thank you, Fred Flintstone, for the $1.
[341:03.13]I want to see you yabba dabba dab on stream in 10 years.
[341:06.05]Bring back the dab.
[341:08.15]I'll be in my 40s in 10 years.
[341:10.09]I don't think I'll be caught dead dabbing.
[341:15.03]Thank you, Just a Row Book, for the $1.
[341:16.91]Cheer 100.
[341:17.49]Thank you.
[341:17.77]That's all they say.
[341:20.31]Uh, Graham Graham Grahambo 350.
[341:24.65]Thanks for the $5.
[341:27.25]No message.
[341:27.71]Just $5.
[341:28.41]Thank you, Graham.
[341:31.35]Indiana 500.
[341:32.17]Thanks for the $1.
[341:32.89]I figured out how to send a message with bits, and I just wanted to say that Garfield is my father.
[341:37.94]We're never going to get rid of this Garfield thing, are we?
[341:40.78]It's going to be around forever.
[341:43.74]Thank you Samuel Sish for the one dollar.
[341:45.28]I regret that bit with the... he's doing the dab emote thing.
[341:50.12]Thanks, dude.
[341:51.84]Thank you KingBot100.
[341:52.94]Here's the monthly Jerma tax.
[341:56.79]Thank you.
[341:58.95]Garfield for life.
[342:01.61]None of you guys even liked Garfield.
[342:04.71]Nobody likes Garfield.
[342:08.88]It's all about the trolls now.
[342:10.96]They brought the trolls back.
[342:13.91]And they made him cool.
[342:17.07]They used to be, like, creepy naked people.
[342:19.17]Now they're, like, cool movie stars.
[342:28.24]But, thank you, uh, KingBot.
[342:29.68]Thank you also to Samuel Sish for the one dollar.
[342:32.96]Here's my Jerma... Tide.
[342:36.30]Tide?
[342:36.82]Tithe?

[342:42.01]God.
[342:46.10]Yeah, like the troll dolls.
[342:47.63]They brought the troll dolls back.
[342:52.11]The troll dolls, you know, like the weird troll dolls with their scary faces and they just didn't have any clothes on.
[342:57.05]It was weird.
[342:59.27]Of all the things to bring back, why would you bring that back?
[343:01.11]But thank you.
[343:11.41]Thank you to Hawkeye of mine again for the $1.
[343:13.39]I plan to take it over and please levy your taxes.
[343:15.85]They're killing my family.
[343:19.67]Thank you, WilderBuddy, for the $0.40.

[343:31.36]I just saw the A and I was like... Thank you, Pochi.
[343:36.95]Don't drink and drive.
[343:39.91]It's true.
[343:40.19]That's very, very good advice.
[343:42.65]You absolutely should not do that.
[343:46.29]Don't be stupid.
[343:48.83]Take a Lyft.
[343:49.67]Take an Uber.
[343:53.17]Good advice.

[345:23.94]Am I still lifting?
[345:24.86]I'm not, unfortunately.
[345:26.09]I start to just get too tired every time.
[345:29.67]I don't know why.
[345:30.49]I think I just start to get a little older.
[345:33.19]I'm slowing down.
[345:34.13]I really am slowing down.
[345:41.47]The Italian guy accent.
[345:43.20]Well, thank you, Pochi.
[345:47.11]I can't just do it.
[345:47.83]I need to, like, hear an Italian accent.
[345:51.49]I need to hear... Let's, like, open up the Godfather.
[345:53.37]Like, a Godfather scene.
[345:55.99]I'll just repeat it.
[345:56.75]Let me try to get in there.
[345:58.54]Hold on.
[346:01.94]Godfather... scene.
[346:05.14]It doesn't even matter.
[346:05.86]I'll just... I'll find a Marlon Brando.
[346:08.00]Okay, this is just the best Godfather scene.
[346:10.95]Okay, let's see what I can do.
[346:18.08]This has got 7 million views.
[346:19.38]This is definitely the best Godfather scene.
[346:22.83]Are there subtitles?
[346:27.07]Money.
[346:27.25]Let me tell you.
[346:32.98]I cannot do that.
[346:36.38]No.
[346:37.12]There are not as many years, but this is the first time you've asked me for my help.
[346:46.72]I can't remember the last time you invited me for a cup of fucking coffee.
[346:49.99]Okay.
[346:53.13]Even though my wife was a godmother, they were only fucking child.
[346:56.79]It's that funny, okay?
[346:58.05]You never wanted my friendship.
[347:00.61]I gotta get it, come on.
[347:01.93]You know, you were afraid of me giving you my debt.
[347:05.96]Oh, I understand.
[347:12.26]He found the finance in America.
[347:17.50]And they made a good living, had police protection, and there were courts of law.
[347:21.24]Alright, I'm done.
[347:25.18]Like a tiny Donald Trump.
[347:29.51]Alright, that's it.
[347:31.61]Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[347:34.27]Excuse me.
[347:34.81]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jerma.
[347:35.81]I'm giving you bits.
[347:36.71]I told you I was one of your biggest fans, and now you're saying nobody likes me?
[347:41.13]Jerma, tell me it isn't true.
[347:42.44]What do I do?
[347:46.90]What I do at work, if I tell them my favorite streamer thinks I'm garbage, I'll write, all my friends say to the bee's knees, I'll kill you with my kindness.
[347:54.08]Now, everybody loves you, this version of Garfield, but not the other version of Garfield.
[347:59.29]There's like three versions of Garfield.
