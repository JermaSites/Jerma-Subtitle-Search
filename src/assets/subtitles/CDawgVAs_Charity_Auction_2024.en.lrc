[14:13.72]Oh my God.
[14:14.76]It's really hot, Martin.
[14:16.56]Oh my God.
[14:17.38]I see it steaming.
[14:18.36]Oh my God, it's steaming.
[14:19.76]It's steaming.
[14:22.92]Martin, thank you so much.
[14:23.94]Have you got anything else to say?
[14:29.30]See you later.
[14:31.60]Hey, can you sign my parking deal?
[14:34.39]Oh, you want to validate your parking?
[14:35.49]Yeah.
[14:36.17]Yeah, somebody back there will validate your parking for you.
[14:38.77]Okay.
[14:40.85]I think it was $15.
[14:43.56]When I signed this staff, I tried to bring back dead relatives, and as you see here, it's so hot.
[14:48.10]I can't hold it.
[14:49.02]Do you want to touch it?
[14:50.48]Oh, my God.
[14:51.06]Why would you hand me that?
[14:52.20]Oh, but it's not real, right, Doug Doug?
[14:54.38]That's just clearly magic, Doug Doug.
[14:55.76]Why would you?
[14:57.58]And, by the way, hold this for a second.
[14:59.34]You can play it like you got it.
[15:03.66]Ooh.
[15:03.82]Huh?
[15:04.20]Don't play it like you got it.
[15:06.86]No, no, no, that's fine.
[15:07.76]No, I heard it.
[15:08.36]I heard the noises.
[15:09.52]$2,000!
[15:10.06]Okay.
[15:11.52]I'll give you your mic back.
[15:13.39]Are we starting at $2,000?
[15:14.13]We're starting at $2,000.
[15:15.65]For the wizened staff of the Great Thicket.
[15:19.11]Oh, Marty.
[15:20.35]3,800.
[15:20.37]3,800.
[15:20.39]From Elwig.
[15:20.79]3,800.
[15:20.91]Already.
[15:28.48]4,000 from Ranboo.
[15:30.14]What do we have in the back here?
[15:31.93]5,000.
[15:32.45]5,000 from Ray.
[15:33.21]And by the way, it's turning into ice.
[15:35.23]Oh, my.
[15:36.15]It's magical.
[15:36.87]I mean, 5,000 is barely enough.
[15:37.65]Do we have 6,000 or 5,500?
[15:38.15]Jeremiah, could I try?
[15:38.78]Oh, it's hard.
[15:39.82]Be very careful.
[15:40.30]It's dangerous.
[15:47.04]I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
[15:47.96]Oh my God.
[15:50.52]Oh my God.
[15:51.86]Oh, you feel the power coming off of it.
[15:55.64]$5,000 as well.
[15:56.36]Do we have more than $5,000 in the room or anyone online?
[15:58.20]Look at that little concoction up there.
[16:00.94]It's a swirling globe.
[16:01.90]Six?
[16:03.10]We have six from Jayden.
[16:04.56]$6,000.
[16:04.88]Oh my God, $6,000.
[16:05.46]Do you want to cast a spell?
[16:06.74]Do you want to cast a spell?
[16:08.10]I don't think I'm powerful enough to be honest.
[16:09.98]Okay, sorry, I can do this.
[16:10.76]Oh, go ahead, please.
[16:15.65]It's dripping.
[16:17.15]The power is dripping out of it.
[16:28.69]What are we at?
[16:29.21]We're at $6,000.
[16:29.57]Is that the spell?
[16:30.37]Is that the spell?
[16:31.19]You just cursed everyone?
[16:32.32]He was gonna, but he didn't.
[16:33.64]This is a charity event?
[16:35.78]What the fuck, Gemma?
[16:37.02]Just Ludwig.
[16:38.12]Just Ludwig.
[16:38.90]Just Ludwig.
[16:39.72]When I curse you, I curse you with health, wealth, and happiness.
[16:43.96]Oh.
[16:44.34]Beautiful.
[16:46.46]Alright, we're at $6,000.
[16:46.86]Does anybody have more than $6,000?
[16:47.64]Do we have 6,500?
[16:53.28]$6,500 to Ray.
[16:55.61]Okay.
[16:56.91]Do we have $7,000?
[16:58.39]$7,000?
[16:58.41]$7,000 to Jayden.
[16:59.53]$7,000.
[17:00.09]I mean, what is a staff like this worth, like, market price?
[17:04.21]I mean, I guess it's probably $20 billion to $35 billion.
[17:06.45]Billion.
[17:07.05]Well, okay, billion.
[17:08.19]Wow.
[17:08.51]It's magic, right?
[17:09.69]A trillion.
[17:10.65]Do you know a staff that does anything like this?
[17:12.82]The dribbles on the floor?
[17:13.86]No, I'm not familiar.
[17:15.18]Well, that could be super glued.
[17:16.66]It's okay.
[17:17.58]Right, right, right.
[17:18.40]We could super glue that.
[17:20.08]$7,000 to Jayden.
[17:20.42]Do we have anyone else who's willing to spend more?
[17:24.23]10K?
[17:24.77]I mean, it's a steal, it's a steal, it's a steal.
[17:27.67]I'm gonna have to get another blessing from Martin.
[17:29.66]What did you say?
[17:44.05]Nothing.
[17:45.11]I didn't hear that.
[17:45.87]Did you hear that?
[17:46.53]I'm kind of scared to know.
[17:49.34]We have $10,000.
[17:50.50]Do we have any more than $10,000?
[17:52.96]Do we have $11,000?
[17:54.06]I signed it.
[17:54.86]Did I say that?
[17:55.50]Yes, you mentioned that.
[17:56.74]It looks good.
[17:58.02]It could have been bigger.
[18:00.70]Should I sign it bigger?
[18:02.00]No, no, no.
[18:02.60]How about down here too?
[18:03.84]Can you sign it there?
[18:04.99]They'll love it, they'll love it.
[18:07.59]$10,000 for Ray.
[18:07.93]Does anybody want to outbid Ray at $10,000?
[18:10.39]Do we have 11 from anybody?
[18:12.83]I can hear the pig.
[18:13.49]What's it made out of?
[18:17.21]Plastic and soles.
[18:21.44]And a swirling ball of glass.
[18:25.08]That's so cool.
[18:25.98]And an inedible liquid.
[18:31.21]Of some kind.
[18:33.19]I'm not entirely sure.
[18:35.09]You know what, this could be fucking cigarette ashes in here.
[18:37.89]I don't know.
[18:39.75]We have $10,000 to raise.
[18:40.85]We have anyone who wants to outbid Ray, I'm guessing we have no more online bidding.
[18:45.48]We are going once for $10,000.
[18:48.44]Going twice and sold for $10,000.
[18:52.80]Ray, come and get your staff of ultimate power.
[18:57.62]Be very careful with this.
[18:59.77]Be very careful.
[19:01.23]I'd love to know why you wanted to win it as well.
[19:04.48]I'd love to hear a little bit about that.
[19:05.68]Wow, thank you so much.
[19:06.34]Here's the staff.
[19:07.08]Here's the mic.
[19:07.76]Wow, so I have a weapon wall, so this will go right on there.
[19:10.96]And you said you tried bringing back dead people?
[19:13.58]Yeah, quite a few.
[19:14.68]Well, now that it's blessed by the wizard, so I could try this on my dad, right?
[19:17.58]Yeah.
[19:18.16]Yeah, yeah.
[19:19.86]Whoa, yes!
[19:20.64]Yes, bring him back!
[19:22.65]Let's bring him back.
[19:23.37]There's no refunds, right?
[19:24.35]There's no refunds.
[19:25.05]It's leaking, but you know.
[19:26.29]Yeah, well, a superglue can take care of it.
[19:27.99]Oh, OK, OK.
[19:28.41]So just clog it up.
[19:29.29]By the way, I have javelin in my backyard.
[19:31.10]OK, so I could do that, too.
[19:33.18]You could.
[19:33.98]Whoa, the badger.
[19:34.98]Oh, my god.
[19:36.54]Is it corrosive?
[19:37.30]Stop, stop.
[19:38.33]No, no.
[19:41.17]It's holy water in there.
[19:42.97]Is that why it's getting emptier and emptier?
[19:44.73]Yeah, yeah.
[19:45.43]It's lowering in volume.
[19:47.23]You can see the signature now, though, so that's good.
[19:49.09]Oh, there it is.
[19:50.07]Oh, nice.
[19:50.65]Well, thank you so much.
[19:51.59]Oh, it's chipped as well.
[19:52.74]I see.
[19:53.26]How did you do this thing?
[19:55.00]I told you.
[19:55.64]I've been using it for about three, four weeks.
[19:58.34]Alright.
[19:58.76]Thank you.
[19:59.58]Well, let's get a round of applause to Ray and to Jerma as well.
[20:03.60]Thank you so much.
[20:04.28]Oh, you can go on this way as well.
[20:05.26]Sorry.
[20:05.40]Yeah, it's easy.
[20:07.08]Wow.
[20:07.68]I can't believe we had the wizard himself show up.
[20:10.53]What a turn of events.
[20:14.61]Oh, no.
[20:15.51]Can we get, like, a tissue or something for that so we don't... It's not just leaking everywhere.
[20:20.52]Alright.
[20:21.78]Well, what an honor.
[20:22.62]What an honor to have the great wizard himself visit.
[20:24.58]Alright, guys, we have some raffle items that... No, no, no, no, no.
[20:28.70]Don't tell him.
[20:29.58]Don't tell him that.
[20:31.40]Alright.
[20:32.63]More!
[20:37.10]Oh my god!
[20:41.66]More than you can afford!
[20:43.38]You know what?
[20:45.18]Hey, hey!
[20:46.14]Nah, I'm good.
[20:49.01]We'll let them come in.
[20:50.07]I don't, like, is it just like, is there anything special about them or is it literally just... They're sketchers.
[20:54.93]They're unbelievable.
[20:55.99]They're unbelievable.
[20:56.65]I've never worn them.
[20:58.73]They're used.
[20:59.55]They're used.
[20:59.99]Okay.
[21:00.87]What about them is unbelievable?
[21:05.26]Okay.
[21:05.80]Right.
[21:06.46]Right, right.
[21:07.32]So 3,000 is a steal.
[21:08.34]I would say it's a steal.
[21:10.45]You would say it's a steal.
[21:11.43]Okay.
[21:11.83]Okay.
[21:12.15]Well, 3,000 is a steal, guys.
[21:13.55]So anybody want to do 31?
[21:14.77]31?
[21:14.89]Not me.
[21:16.77]Not you.
[21:18.41]But it's a steal.
[21:19.01]Surely, it's a steal.
[21:22.38]You already got three more pairs of Charlie's specific Skechers.
[21:25.14]There's actually a photo of both of us standing with Skechers on the same pair of shoes I'm not getting.
[21:29.70]Wait, really?
[21:30.80]Oh, that's awesome.
[21:32.06]Alright.
[21:32.74]We have 3,000.
[21:33.64]Any online bids coming in?
[21:35.40]Last minute, do we have any more coming in?
[21:37.64]I do want to end this stream at some point.
[21:39.98]Alright.
[21:42.00]OK, Gemma's coming up.
[21:45.20]OK.
[21:47.42]You cannot.
[21:48.40]No, you cannot.
[21:49.84]You cannot put your hand in there.
[21:56.69]Do you guys think Gemma's going to get it first time?
[21:57.99]Yes.
[21:58.89]Of course.
[21:59.59]Nope.
[22:03.83]Maybe I just never do the punishment.
[22:05.35]Maybe I never do it.
[22:06.11]That's also nice too.
[22:09.41]How many people?
[22:11.19]There's infinite money in the machine.
[22:13.18]There's an infinite amount in that machine.
[22:14.90]They can pay for it.
[22:16.64]Alright.
[22:17.58]Line it up.
[22:17.98]Line it up.
[22:18.32]Line it up.
[22:18.70]Okay.
[22:19.12]We can.
[22:19.78]You're moving too much.
[22:22.16]Oh.
[22:22.48]No, no, no.
[22:25.10]Okay, you know what?
[22:26.20]I have a backup here.
[22:31.76]Oh, oh my God.
[22:32.80]Oh my God.
[22:33.40]What are you doing?
[22:34.30]What are you doing?
[22:35.16]I had the key.
[22:36.68]Hey!
[22:37.08]Diver!
[22:44.08]Diver!
[22:44.98]Diver!
[22:46.28]Diver!
[22:46.94]Alright, let's find out what punishment I'm doing.
[22:51.78]First try, baby.
[22:52.64]Oh, God.
[22:53.68]What is it?
[22:54.15]What is it?
[22:54.49]What am I doing?
[22:55.07]Did we break it?
[22:55.77]Did we break the... We didn't.
[22:57.07]I hope not.
[22:58.35]Every time someone bits, take a drink.
[23:04.63]No, we're doing that right now?
[23:05.65]Back to back?
[23:06.31]You've got to be fucking with me.
[23:08.29]No.
[23:10.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:11.56]What is that?
[23:12.10]What is that?
[23:12.64]Hold up.
[23:14.00]Production, what was that again?
[23:14.94]What is in this?
[23:16.70]Watermelon.
[23:18.02]Peanut butter.
[23:21.31]Nacho cheese sauce and jalapeños.
[23:25.21]Dude, what the fuck?
[23:31.32]That's fucked up.
[23:33.50]Why did you put so much cheese sauce?
[23:35.40]Look at this.
[23:39.30]I just swallowed it.
[23:41.40]Oh, God.
[23:47.09]Oh, my God.
[23:49.29]That is vile.
[23:50.19]I hate you so much, chat.
[23:53.55]What the fuck?
[23:54.41]Wait, you didn't do lettuce, lettuce, lettuce, lettuce, and lettuce?
[23:59.85]No, I... Oh, my God.
[24:01.87]Oh, God.
[24:02.49]You know what?
[24:03.33]I give this a solid 6 out of 10.
[24:04.77]6 out of 10.
[24:12.06]What?
[24:13.30]How do they feel to eat that?
[24:14.76]Like, it really, like, the watermelon does save it, right?
[24:17.12]Like, it takes over the flavor.
[24:18.18]Yeah, for some reason, the watermelon makes it all OK.
[24:21.49]Oh, no, it does not.
[24:23.55]What the fuck are you talking about, Poki?
[24:25.83]It's fucking disgusting.
[24:27.79]I could kind of take another bite.
[24:29.85]Oh, oh, by all means, by all means.
[24:31.71]No, no, go ahead, another.
[24:32.79]The watermelon's really good.
[24:35.45]That is fresh, guys.
[24:37.67]Oh.
[24:38.23]You want to try it?
[24:39.23]You're going to be OK, I promise.
[24:41.19]You got it, you got it.
[24:41.81]We're gonna be okay.
[24:47.03]It's so good.
[24:47.93]He says it's so good.
[24:49.03]Oh my God.
[24:51.94]Oh my God.
[24:52.80]Did you just take a second bite?
[24:55.68]Oh my God.
[24:58.76]We can get a to-go box if you guys want.
[25:01.04]This is not going anywhere.
[25:05.72]How is it?
[25:06.16]How is it?
[25:06.74]Explain the textures.
[25:07.60]Okay, so the wasabi gives it a little bit of a kick, which I'm a big fan of.
[25:12.88]I love it.
[25:13.96]Wasabi fans?
[25:16.58]Not with this abomination.
[25:18.22]I don't like the fact that it looks like a gremlin's kind of gummy mouth.
[25:24.04]It looks like it could talk.
[25:25.86]But I think the flavor is there.
[25:26.84]The nacho cheese gives it a little bit of sweetness.
[25:29.28]It reminds me of a sandwich in a blender a little bit.
[25:34.35]It's like a little mushy.
[25:35.59]I think I'm going in for bite number two.
[25:37.71]Alright.
[25:38.29]Well, thank you guys so much for coming up.
[25:39.63]Give a round of applause to Jerma, Eric, and Pokey for eating the most disgusting sandwich.
[25:44.51]What are you doing?
[25:45.25]Stop!
[25:46.25]Stop!
[25:48.09]No, no, no, don't!
[25:49.73]Just take it, just take it.
[25:50.87]Just take it home with you.
[25:52.50]Oh, God, I feel gross.
[25:56.68]That is the most vile thing I've ever eaten without even question.
[25:59.64]That is so gross.
[26:04.85]It looks like dog shit and poof.
[26:07.93]Alright, while they're handing that out, let's get our next video.
