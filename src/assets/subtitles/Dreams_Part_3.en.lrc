[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.32]Hi, guys.
[00:03.96]How are you?
[00:06.38]Yes, we are very, very early.
[00:10.12]So early.
[00:13.18]2 p.m.
[00:13.88]Eastern now.
[00:15.34]11 a.m.
[00:16.22]Pacific.
[00:19.58]Yeah, it's very early.
[00:20.58]You know, I... I went to bed last night and I thought to myself...
[00:31.48]You know, I neglect all the European crowd.
[00:37.38]And I felt really bad about it.
[00:38.64]I was like, you know what?
[00:40.56]I need to really start to do EU streams.
[00:43.40]That's why I did this today.
[00:44.60]It has nothing to do with my dog having a vet appointment in like four and a half hours.
[00:56.11]Absolutely nothing to do with that.
[01:02.97]But, no, the truth is, yes, I have to go to the vet with Otto.
[01:08.51]He's fine, don't worry.
[01:11.03]But because the appointment is weirdly in the afternoon, instead of just outright just not streaming today, because at 3, 4, 5, I never get back in time to start a stream.
[01:29.75]Because this event that I go to usually has appointments scheduled out in the... Scheduled out.
[01:34.68]I'm still waking up here.
[01:36.52]Scheduled out into the afternoon.
[01:39.02]So instead of just not streaming today, I was like, you know what?
[01:43.04]Let's just go.
[01:43.50]Let's just do it in the morning.
[01:45.59]For like three or four hours.
[01:47.77]And because this stream is only going to be like three hours... We're going to go on Saturday too.
[01:55.75]So we're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang.
[01:57.49]Four days in a row.
[01:59.43]Would you like to know what we're doing on Saturday?
[02:04.09]Take a guess.
[02:04.91]How would you ever guess?
[02:05.64]There's like 500 million different things to do.
[02:08.22]Hey, what are we doing on Saturday?
[02:09.46]Can you guess?
[02:13.64]No, you can't.
[02:18.26]It was recommended to me a while ago.
[02:20.50]And I figured that's a good Saturday night kind of stream.
[02:24.11]Is the MS-DOS archive.org website.
[02:29.16]I'm gonna turn on smart clicks, and we're gonna play a shitload of old MS-DOS games.
[02:41.25]That's what's gonna happen on Saturday night.
[02:47.95]I'm looking forward to it.
[02:52.45]There are, when I looked at it, I think there were 4,337.
[02:58.54]MS DOS games.
[03:01.82]And it doesn't have to be a one-time thing.
[03:04.40]I'm thinking if it's fun enough... We could do that for like a Saturday night stream... For the next couple weeks.
[03:11.75]You know, DOS night.
[03:15.87]Well, I would call it something else.
[03:16.99]I would definitely call it something else...
[03:28.31]But today, because I was fighting with the idea of what can I do in three hours today.
[03:33.91]I was like, well, I was going to play Dreams today, but I don't have enough time.
[03:39.04]I want to move controllers.
[03:43.46]To really sculpt and shit, because I want to really get into that.
[03:46.58]It's a lot of fun.
[03:48.66]But I want to be comfortable doing it.
[03:51.51]So what I figured is, instead of sculpting and making things...
[03:57.39]Maybe I'll make something small.
[04:00.23]But... As you can see when I turn this on... We're just gonna surf.
[04:10.52]I think I'm hovering over the perfect thing to start with.
[04:15.80]This is... This stuff wasn't here before.
[04:21.58]So we'll do another little surf here.
[04:23.04]I believe it's 30 different dreams, right?
[04:29.55]is what you get when you do a general surf, or we can just pick them up.
[04:37.67]I have cookie clicker open right now.
[04:40.51]This cookie clicker or the original cookie clicker?
[04:44.61]So that's important.
[04:45.29]Maybe we can throw in the auto surf.
[04:56.43]But yeah, I'm not going to create anything.
[04:57.84]I'm not going to spend like six, seven hours making anything today.
[05:00.46]Because I really want to get those move controllers working.
[05:08.56]And I don't have the camera.
[05:10.09]I was going to go out late last night and find a Walmart or a Best Buy or a Target or something that was open.
[05:18.96]And I did the thing where you can search to see what they have for inventory.
[05:23.30]And none of them open had the PS Camera.
[05:29.93]So, couldn't do that.
[05:32.13]I guess that would be Dexter from Dexter's Lab somehow.
[05:36.63]I feel like we kind of have to open that one.
[05:39.67]Yeah, we do.
[05:41.71]Dexter's Lab.
[05:52.31]Hope it has... Theme song?
[06:04.13]Is there any sounds at all?
[06:05.25]Take book.
[06:09.59]Oh, right.
[06:10.07]Forgot.
[06:11.91]I thought that open... Let me tell you something.
[06:14.05]Never have your secret lab right behind the book.
[06:17.88]How would... Opposite side.
[06:22.73]Flo's lab.
[06:23.55]Alright, let's go.
[06:32.24]Can I jump?
[06:35.82]Oh, I can't wait to find... I can do it.
[06:41.87]Hold on.
[06:42.43]No, I can't.
[06:45.57]It's too early.
[06:50.53]It's not close.
[06:51.47]It's okay.
[06:52.31]That's You know when they do impression contests?
[06:56.99]It's like 40 people come up on stage Give us your best Dexter's lab Dexter and you get some really bad ones.
[07:04.17]I would be one of the guys there I'd be in the top 20.
[07:08.69]You know you would hear it you'd go Yeah Yeah, I mean I'm not embarrassed for you
[07:18.31]I mean, I am.
[07:20.49]You're doing a Dexter's Lab impression contest, so right off the bat, I am.
[07:25.51]But not after that.
[07:26.63]Not after that.
[07:30.92]At this time, you don't have any tasks, but soon here will be a complete list of missions for you.
[07:38.64]Okay.
[07:46.28]Yeah, EU stream today.
[07:48.60]It's gonna be... Here's the worst part about this.
[07:50.68]I feel so bad about this, because... First EU stream in a long time.
[07:56.68]And it's three hours long.
[07:58.92]Hey, what was your last, like, regular stream?
[08:01.92]Uh, seven and a half hours or something like that.
[08:04.60]What was your last EU stream?
[08:05.86]Yeah, two, three, whatever.
[08:12.33]Do you really give a shit about your EU audience?
[08:14.23]Yeah, three hours.
[08:16.71]See you six months from now when I do this again.
[08:19.48]Is this robot in Dexter's now?
[08:25.92]I don't remember the orange Cheeto robot.
[08:32.26]I haven't seen the show in a long time.
[08:36.03]This is really good though.
[08:40.23]Mark the calendar, November 9th, EU stream.
[08:49.07]I wanna see the- wait, wait, where's the, um... This makes his mountain creation look slightly poor.
[09:01.35]Yeah.
[09:03.09]I- I know.
[09:04.33]But listen.
[09:05.45]Listen to me!
[09:07.33]We all- we all have the things we're good at, right?
[09:10.82]I'm g- I'm not- what is that?
[09:14.80]I'm not good at making stuff like this.
[09:20.66]At all.
[09:22.04]And I appreciate that people are.
[09:24.99]I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth.
[09:27.61]I do a full two minutes.
[09:28.93]Unlike a lot of you idiots.
[09:31.39]You don't brush your teeth for a full two minutes.
[09:33.09]I do that.
[09:33.51]I do that very well.
[09:41.66]Two minutes.
[09:42.44]That's right.
[09:43.90]Every time I go to the dentist.
[09:46.08]You have really, really nice teeth.
[09:48.34]I know.
[09:48.68]Yeah, I do it well.
[09:49.62]I see you got the thing that you do.
[09:53.18]You're a dentist.
[09:55.42]Highly paid, highly skilled job.
[09:57.76]See, I brush teeth good, don't I?
[09:59.78]We all do the things we do well.
[10:02.40]And the dentist is like, sir, please stop talking.
[10:04.54]I'm trying to give you a crown.
[10:07.28]Oh, right.
[10:07.78]Yeah, sorry about that.
[10:13.26]This is really cool.
[10:16.11]I'll give that one a thumbs up.
[10:21.73]But, yeah, look, let's compare that with mine.
[10:24.45]Those of you that weren't here last night.
[10:26.99]Let's see mine.
[10:28.11]Uh, okay.
[10:33.01]My creations.
[11:00.79]Alright.
[11:02.05]Look.
[11:03.77]I get where you're coming from here.
[11:06.77]I get where you're coming from here, but also understand that somebody has to make the art on the back of the cereal box.
[11:15.73]There's a place for all of us here.
[11:25.56]I don't need my painting hung up in an art gallery, an expensive art gallery.
[11:30.24]Everyone comes in and says, oh, this is unbelievable.
[11:34.44]Somebody has to draw Toucan Sam and put him back there and make the fun puzzles.
[11:40.53]Doesn't have to be the best art you've ever seen, but it exists.
[11:49.06]What's this back here?
[11:49.74]Oh, this is a guy's... Well, I fucked up his eyes.
[11:52.75]No, don't... Get me out of here.
[11:53.87]Don't make me want to fix this.
[11:55.01]I will want to fix this.
[12:00.63]It's a guy... That's his nose.
[12:02.27]And his nose is sniffing over the mountain.
[12:04.08]That's his hand.
[12:04.80]Oh, I didn't even play it.
[12:07.28]What am I, stupid?
[12:08.00]I didn't even play it.
[12:08.54]Look.
[12:16.10]It looks good from far away.
[12:17.18]Yeah, that's what it's supposed to be.
[12:18.18]It's like drawing a name on a grain of rice.
[12:25.29]People end up wondering what's over here.
[12:26.99]This is the oil coming out of his head because this is the robot fight over here that I was doing.
[12:32.97]He's punching through this guy's head.
[12:34.15]That's oil.
[12:36.73]Alright.
[12:41.75]I hope they see that one.
[12:47.72]But oh, no, no don't save don't save and then there's this This is this thing This is supposed to be me
[13:18.79]There we go.
[13:19.17]This is where the camera's supposed to be, like, right here.
[13:25.84]Yes, it's supposed to be a jaw- I saw- I saw people talking about, what the fuck is going on here?
[13:29.36]Was it supposed to be a jawbreaker?
[13:30.68]It was, because it's supposed to be my mouth and... I don't know what the hell I was doing.
[13:37.35]My butt legit clenched.
[13:41.23]Yeah, oh, don't people, like... Oh, yeah, maybe I shouldn't... I got 12 thumbs up on this thing!
[13:48.23]I didn't do that.
[13:52.41]And then here's this one.
[13:53.27]If you didn't see it, just want to show you if you didn't see it, this is called Scorpion Boss.
[13:57.50]This is the ice cream one.
[14:00.10]And you'll understand that in a minute.
[14:03.02]That's the Jerma ice cream face, which is supposed to be an emote, but I didn't have time to do it.
[14:10.92]I cannot get over that.
[14:12.94]Do you guys know that I was laughing in bed last night?
[14:19.93]At that picture of the person that made the popsicle one.
[14:26.96]It's too... I did not... That's not what I was trying to make.
[14:39.09]It's just so... Ugh.
[14:42.30]I did not... That's not what I was doing.
[14:44.84]Anyways, there are my three creations.
[14:46.64]What does this one have?
[14:48.58]Oh, I didn't make this one public yet, because it's not done.
[14:51.86]You couldn't make this one more done, so obviously it's gonna stay like that.
[15:00.92]So, compare that with... Somebody has to make Toucan Sam, right?
[15:05.77]Somebody has to...
[15:07.67]Art is the best thing about art.
[15:09.83]I can make anything I want.
[15:11.19]The thing could be a piece of crap if I wanted it to.
[15:14.90]And I could somehow stand up here and be like, well, um, are you sure?
[15:20.48]And I would put on my big glasses and stare at it and go, well, because I have some news for you, it doesn't matter because art is completely subjective.
[15:35.89]And I start talking like a serial mascot.
[15:39.49]You know, for my inevitable fate.
[15:44.52]Let's just, um... Let's just breeze through some.
[15:49.16]This is called Ball World.
[15:52.42]You sound like Krillin from Dragon Ball.
[15:58.22]Krillin?
[16:00.06]Press the touchpad.
[16:01.82]World select.
[16:02.60]Oh, this is the menu.
[16:09.57]World select.
[16:11.95]Update.
[16:12.37]Support me.
[16:13.07]World select.
[16:14.11]We'll see you soon.
[16:15.25]Sonic menu.
[16:16.09]Are you kidding me?
[16:30.58]This doesn't surprise me at all.
[16:32.88]I'm gonna turn it down.
[16:38.50]This doesn't surprise me at all, considering what people were showing me in VRChat.
[16:45.00]It's not surprising.
[16:46.40]People are just so good at doing these things.
[16:49.75]Alright, well, I guess, oh, I can... You just go down into the city?
[17:01.54]Alright, that's fucking cool.
[17:02.88]Alright, we're gonna go... Of course, we're gonna go to Green Hill Zone.
[17:11.70]LBP pod.
[17:22.03]LBP... Oh, it's a little big planet, okay.
[17:28.56]There's triangle change in music.
[17:30.70]Touchpad to hide.
[17:36.94]Okay.
[17:39.52]This is really great, too.
[17:44.06]Somebody just go... Yo!
[17:49.00]Ball World Adventure map.
[17:50.24]Let's go.
[17:50.62]Do I have to stay on this?
[17:57.27]Is this like that toy in the doctor's office?
[18:01.43]Oh, no, no, no, this is the actual overworld, okay.
[18:08.84]Let's go Sky Hills 1-3.
[18:09.92]Here's the Sonic level.
[18:14.11]Sonic?
[18:14.43]What is the Sonic level?
[18:19.27]Sonic, I'm having... Sonic, I'm having a feeling about this place.
[18:24.88]Looks like we've been here long ago.
[18:27.58]Anyway, the good news is there are only 40 lost emeralds.
[18:31.68]But wait, I see something on my smart teleport radar device.
[18:35.82]Maybe only the storm.
[18:37.90]Never mind.
[18:38.40]Be careful out there.
[18:39.68]Come back to the future platform.
[18:41.56]No, I thought that meant, like, come back to the future.
[18:44.76]Come back to the future platform base safe and sound.
[18:47.61]Got it.
[18:48.05]Good luck, time traveler.
[18:57.47]This looks familiar but different.
[19:10.28]I thought I'm gonna double jump?
[19:13.26]Oh, I died.
[19:13.68]Alright, does anybody think, and mean absolutely no disrespect to anyone that loves this franchise,
[19:36.85]But what do you think of Sonic the Hedgehog?
[19:39.01]What's the first thing you think of?
[19:42.69]Besides, like, speed.
[19:49.44]Think of how loud the game is.
[19:50.76]Alright, how about now?
[19:52.14]What do you think of now?
[19:57.60]Oh.
[20:03.50]Okay, guys, this is a bad experiment, because that's not what I'm... Okay, not like... No, no, no, no, no.
[20:08.96]Alright, well, what I was gonna say was music.
[20:10.98]I was gonna say music.
[20:12.90]If that's the first thing you think of, then boy, they got a long way to go to fucking salvage this guy.
[20:31.97]Imagine that.
[20:34.20]Oh, hey, what the... Super Mario.
[20:36.00]What's the first thing you think of when you think of the word Super Mario Brothers?
[20:39.00]Porn!
[20:39.88]Porn feet!
[20:40.76]Porn!
[20:44.18]Um... Okay, we're gonna... Uh, I don't... I was... I'm surprised.
[21:00.14]Alright, well, I was gonna say music.
[21:02.58]So why wouldn't they just make more?
[21:04.60]Nevermind, I'm gonna move on because this is not gonna work.
[21:07.40]Sonic, be careful from here on.
[21:08.78]There is no way back.
[21:09.82]You should have found at least 35 emeralds.
[21:13.41]Check em.
[21:14.25]Out.
[21:14.97]And go ahead if you're ready.
[21:17.27]I only have 26.
[21:17.85]It's like an E3 conference.
[21:24.74]You know when the guy asks the crowd something?
[21:31.40]Imagine, like, Sonic has an E3 conference.
[21:36.26]And fucking, I don't know, George, whatever his name is, comes out.
[21:39.76]Whoever the CEO of Sonic the Hedgehog is.
[21:44.51]Or SEGA.
[21:48.67]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, joining us now is the head of Sonic Team.
[21:53.99]George!
[21:55.45]Comes out with a fucking suit on.
[21:58.50]Alright, hey, hey everybody, how are you?
[22:00.91]Hey, how are you?
[22:03.79]Yeah, yeah, good, yeah, thank you, thank you.
[22:06.93]So today, um, but, but, whoa, wait, there's a shark here.
[22:15.25]Whoa.
[22:17.07]That's pretty cool.
[22:19.65]Anyway, so, uh, ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you something.
[22:22.87]Before I get started with my next major announcement.
[22:26.24]By show of hands, how many of you guys associate Sonic the Hedgehog with porn or feet?
[22:33.14]And it's like they scroll over all the journalists and they're all fucking putting their hands up?
[22:43.19]No, that's right, that's right.
[22:44.59]So what we're announcing here today.
[22:47.83]Right, right, yeah, yeah.
[22:54.88]Alright, I don't have enough emeralds.
[22:56.14]Uh... Run towards the screen like in Sonic Adventure.
[23:14.34]I didn't play this one!
[23:15.36]Oh, I have 31!
[23:29.24]He's stuck.
[23:30.02]I don't think I ever played that one.
[23:32.74]I played it on stream.
[23:33.88]I don't remember that.
[23:38.96]Hope I'll make more levels in the future.
[23:40.32]Press triangle to change music.
[23:45.97]Oh, this is the menu for that.
[23:47.07]Okay.
[23:50.23]Okay, this is Ball World.
[23:59.90]Get a tie.
[24:00.34]This is cool.
[24:02.76]Oh, I'm gonna fall.
[24:04.90]This is a little slippery.
[24:07.26]It's very slippery.
[24:08.38]He put extra grease on here.
[24:17.83]That's fast.
[24:21.35]Brush your hands.
[24:21.97]How many of you people associate Ball World with porn and feet?
[24:27.15]Oh, that's too many.
[24:27.83]Too many.
[24:28.43]Too many.
[24:28.75]Well, not today.
[24:45.70]This is actually kind of good.
[24:48.62]Now this is just... It really is like a close-up doctor's office toy.
[24:51.20]Do I have to go around it, or just jump?
[24:56.94]I think I have to go... I don't think I have enough speed.
[25:01.69]No, I gotta just... Oh god.
[25:12.77]Do I have to go up?
[25:23.67]There's a Sonic menu.
[25:24.47]Wait, I already did this one.
[25:30.95]This is the garden.
[25:31.69]There we go, this is what I wanted.
[25:32.51]Little big plant, the garden.
[25:45.14]This reminds me of your iPad game streams.
[25:48.27]Well, it's a pretty similar format.
[25:50.50]You play something for ten... Well, that's like the appeal, right?
[25:54.22]The appeal of this game... is... to just surf around and see what people have made.
[26:02.77]It could be anything.
[26:03.29]It doesn't have to be a game.
[26:04.23]It could just be artwork.
[26:08.57]I just hope that they... keep updating those tools and keep making it, you know, intuitive and creative.
[26:15.98]Because we've seen some awesome paintings in this game.
[26:19.60]The last time we did a little bit of dream surfing.
[26:23.21]I know everybody wants to make a game or see a game.
[26:26.79]But holy shit, some of those are good.
[26:27.99]I missed a ball.
[26:32.77]Now, how many of you... Why is it Dr. Phil?
[26:38.24]Dr. Phil comes... Alright, Dr. Phil comes out to announce the new Sonic game, and he asks that question.
[26:43.98]And then he psychoanalyses everybody in the audience.
[26:48.77]Now, why do you think that?
[26:50.51]Why are you searching for porn in Sonic the Hedgehog?
[27:00.03]What happened?
[27:06.75]Aww...
[27:18.85]I like this button.
[27:19.53]You know what I want to make?
[27:20.68]If I'm going to make a level ever, I want it to be a bunch of wall jumps.
[27:29.78]Sonic has a uni eyeball.
[27:32.22]It's a mega turn off.
[27:37.55]Alright.
[27:43.07]Oh, cookie clicker ultimate!
[27:44.39]This is what I came here for!
[27:47.26]Earn cookies by clicking a huge cookie.
[27:50.18]Wait, okay.
[27:51.98]Upgrade achievements.
[28:05.47]Cookie clicker.
[28:07.39]Cookie, no, you can't use that here.
[28:09.61]You cannot use like the porn reference here.
[28:15.67]Only one cookie per... Hold on.
[28:19.85]I'm limited to the amount of times I can press X. And it's not even registering them all.
[28:25.69]Alright, what about upgrades?
[28:26.57]This is actually... Somebody made this.
[28:33.59]How many grandma's?
[28:35.92]No, I need a better cursor.
[28:40.76]Let's go back to it.
[28:48.72]Get grandmas.
[28:49.60]Get grandmas.
[28:53.48]I'm getting them.
[28:56.42]How do I get more per click?
[29:00.43]Cursor.
[29:01.17]There we go.
[29:05.11]97 cookies.
[29:07.55]Profound statement.
[29:10.41]Is this going to be the next three hours?
[29:11.71]Look, I don't schedule anything, you know?
[29:16.62]I don't plan anything.
[29:17.68]I don't really schedule anything.
[29:18.97]So, I mean, it's like very possible that this could be, you know, if I'm having fun.
[29:28.61]Such bold content to stream.
[29:30.61]Alright, I need... Gold cookie?
[29:44.89]Can't you click on cookies?
[29:46.07]Don't they pop up randomly?
[29:51.30]What are you doing?
[29:52.08]Um... What?
[29:57.24]I don't... This is a recreation of Cookie Clicker in Dream.
[30:08.82]This is really well made, and everyone's just mad that I'm gonna be playing it for... Alright, fine.
[30:23.60]This is what you get for the EU stream, yeah.
[30:27.82]The EU-friendly stream is me playing a remake of Cookie Clicker.
[30:31.76]Alright, I gotta get out of here before I stay here all day.
[30:34.54]I'm gonna, like, miss my dog's appointment.
[30:38.67]No, but you don't understand.
[30:39.45]I have to go.
[30:43.39]I got 700.
[30:43.99]Let me just get one factory.
[30:46.13]No, let me just get one portal, and then I'm out of here.
[30:48.23]I'm done.
[30:48.49]I just want at least one of each.
[30:52.08]I just want one of each.
[30:53.20]That's it.
[30:53.54]Okay, here we go.
[31:02.01]I want five of each.
[31:02.81]I almost have 2,000.
[31:03.27]Don't worry.
[31:03.69]Okay, come on.
[31:05.34]Almost there.
[31:19.99]Make an idle game with, like, the planets.
[31:28.13]You know, I've actually thought about something like that before.
[31:29.93]I thought about... making an idle game.
[31:50.02]and make a bunch of elaborate stupid things you can do in it.
[31:56.46]It's funny you mention that, because I've been talking to somebody in particular about making a full-fledged game.
[32:11.26]One that is, you know, comes out and releases.
[32:14.66]That you can play.
[32:22.44]And I got a little bit of a hint for you.
[32:24.18]They're currently VIPed right now.
[32:27.04]Alright, all I wanted was 15 of each.
[32:29.70]And I got what I wanted, 20 of each.
[32:31.65]And I got exactly what I wanted.
[32:59.27]Like a dating sim.
[33:02.11]Somebody recommended that.
[33:05.69]To have... Hold on a minute.
[33:23.86]Hold on a minute.
[33:24.74]It kind of looks like my face from back here.
[33:27.82]That could be me.
[33:37.19]That looks just like me.
[33:39.17]It does.
[33:40.75]Wait, who's this?
[33:42.73]Did I just drown?
[33:44.57]I just drowned.
[33:45.91]Is there a punch?
[33:52.37]I think I just get chased.
[33:53.59]I need 30 coins.
[34:01.86]The braid is perfect.
[34:04.43]All pirates must use secret tunnel.
[34:06.23]Beware of ye beasties.
[34:07.53]No treasure hunting allowed.
[34:08.63]Who is this person behind me?
[34:10.61]Why did the... It's a person inside of a person?
[34:25.16]That's a person inside of another person.
[34:33.71]That's not supposed to be one... That looks like a baby holding on to its mother.
[34:43.42]No, guys, that's two people.
[34:44.52]There's two hats.
[34:46.58]Don't tell me this is not the same person.
[34:48.30]There's two hats!
[34:59.82]What do you mean we know?
[35:01.06]Oh, was I just arguing with myself?
[35:12.10]Why did I make up this character in my head that told me this was one person?
[35:15.38]I don't know.
[35:20.94]22.
[35:21.42]Oh, not yet.
[35:27.23]Oh, boy.
[35:27.83]I don't know.
[35:30.05]What's the mechanic based?
[35:31.37]Why is that here?
[35:35.55]You're talking to one guy.
[35:36.69]Say I knew what I was doing.
[35:43.58]Alright, is this person still following me?
[35:45.75]No, they can't get up here.
[35:48.55]So I need 22.
[35:58.82]That ghost is not getting up here, are they?
[36:00.14]I don't think it's supposed to be up here.
[36:07.84]Alright, this is the unfinished zone.
[36:09.75]Guaranteed, because that's a non-painted T-Rex over here.
[36:14.64]Damn it.
[36:15.36]Oh, I knew it.
[36:16.10]I need to go see what that says.
[36:23.40]That's Developer Island.
[36:28.00]They want to keep me out of there?
[36:29.92]Don't you know?
[36:32.16]Do you know what I used to do in World of Warcraft when I was bored?
[36:36.33]I would find a corner and I would jump up to it.
[36:41.85]For hours.
[36:42.61]Until I got up the ledge on top of the mountain and ran into the no player zone.
[36:48.13]You're gonna keep me out?
[36:51.57]Doubt it.
[36:51.89]I would do it for hours.
[36:55.03]Hours.
[37:00.83]There was this one spot in Ironforge.
[37:03.55]In the corner.
[37:04.35]Next to, I believe, the mailbox.
[37:06.95]Where if you jumped at the right moment...
[37:10.52]And pixel perfect jumped over and over again.
[37:12.72]You could get to the top onto the ceiling.
[37:15.78]And people would be sitting there doing it.
[37:18.54]And they wouldn't be able to do it.
[37:20.08]They would be just, you know, five or six people would do it.
[37:22.22]This was back when they were like fucking five trillion people that played the damn game.
[37:27.05]And I would just crack my knuckles.
[37:28.81]I would log in.
[37:29.65]I'd be like, alright, let's check the mail out.
[37:32.13]We got like three or four people trying to do the jump, huh?
[37:37.32]crack my fucking knuckles and I would go do it first try and everyone would stand there and stop look up at me while I like did like the wave from all the way at the top and I would go I'd get on my huge awesome fucking dragon up there like I'd get on my awesome mount up there so people like oh he's on the mount too and then they would try again and I would try I wouldn't tell him the secret why would a magician ever reveal their secret
[38:07.06]Alright, what does that sign say?
[38:13.24]I want to go see the T-Rex, but I can't go stand over there.
[38:15.66]Can I stand here?
[38:18.39]No, definitely not, right?
[38:21.49]No, alright.
[38:21.89]Developer Island.
[38:25.29]Is, uh... Oh, well that's the... Is that the... I think that's just the door.
[38:33.44]Do not feed anyone to the animals.
[38:50.64]I don't think he has collision on his head.
[38:54.20]Why am I lying?
[38:58.02]Why would I lie about something so stupid?
[39:05.05]That's the dumbest thing to lie about.
[39:10.76]Because you have... What?
[39:16.16]I'm not a liar.
[39:17.94]Stop it, T-Rex.
[39:25.95]Oh.
[39:26.39]Well, I just had to walk in.
[39:29.01]That was... I just skipped that.
[39:35.33]I like this one.
[39:36.33]I like that one.
[39:41.17]Yeah, why are you, like, lying about... Alright, I already did this one.
[39:46.59]Hey, dude, why are you lying about jumping in this specific corner in World of Warcraft?
[39:54.21]Oh, no.
[39:57.32]Every day he'd eat the same kind of food, dress the same, sit in front of the same kind of games.
[40:05.35]Yeah, he was just that kind of guy.
[40:08.01]But then one day he goes and kills us all.
[40:11.15]He couldn't even be original about the way he did it.
[40:15.51]I'm not complaining.
[40:16.85]I was dying of boredom anyway.
[40:21.62]But guess what?
[40:24.67]Damn.
[40:25.27]Alright, so this is... This is not a game this time.
[40:38.02]We're just watching.
[40:47.52]Nice.
[40:54.04]Oh, I love it.
[41:05.17]So this is the kind of shit that I would want to do.
[41:08.87]And I'm... I want to move the... I want to get, like, record and camera and shit.
[41:21.10]Can I just be, like, the camera guy?
[41:22.52]Okay.
[41:26.96]Can somebody make me something cool and give me the assets and I'll just make a video?
[41:30.94]Can I just like edit the video?
[41:37.25]Instead we got the scorpion boss fight.
[41:48.04]I'm gonna ruin this song for everybody here.
[41:51.67]But the Silent Hill theme song is just a slowed down nice Italian restaurant.
[41:57.05]This is still going, huh?
[42:28.31]This reminds me of the Godfather.
[42:31.83]Yeah, yeah.
[42:36.29]Cloud Factory.
[42:38.27]Another video!
[42:39.15]Good!
[42:39.47]This is what I'm talking about!
[42:43.05]Another thing we can just watch!
[42:45.99]Streamer doesn't produce any content, he just consumes it on camera with you.
[42:51.50]Look at that!
[42:53.28]Look at this camera work!
[42:55.26]I don't have to do anything!
[42:58.38]We can just sit here!
[43:01.84]Look at that log!
[43:03.68]Nice placement of the log!
[43:20.47]You ever just have a weird freakout moment for five seconds?
[43:26.12]I'm gonna give you the weird, insane, freak-out moment that I just had right now.
[43:30.81]And these feelings are only a tenth of a second, and then they're gone because my brain goes, you're an idiot, what are you talking about, stop being a weirdo.
[43:38.43]When he put his hand out like that and was looking, I just, for a tenth of my brain was just in a splash.
[43:44.81]It was like, you have a VR headset on, take it off.
[43:47.23]Uh, no, I'm not in VR.
[44:00.82]It was not even a tenth of a tenth.
[44:02.28]It's lies.
[44:11.47]This is really good.
[44:12.23]You're ruining this.
[44:12.93]Stop it.
[44:14.93]Everything's a lie.
[44:27.70]Uh... Dream Cheese.
[44:29.36]That's... Well, beautiful fucking landscape, I'll tell you.
[44:36.55]By Dream Cheese.
[44:38.97]The smokestack... Look at the... No, I wanna go... Can we rewind?
[44:41.75]I can't even.
[44:42.35]Those smokestacks back there?
[44:46.15]Green Hill Test Zone.
[44:47.49]Is this another Sonic the Hedgehog?
[44:58.76]I can't get the rings.
[45:02.16]I don't know how to do Sonic Slope logic, so just run into it.
[45:16.07]Nice.
[45:18.39]Silent Hill's police station.
[45:24.62]Oh, fuck.
[45:27.03]That's very, that's really high quality sculpture.
[45:29.17]That's high fidelity sculpturing.
[45:30.53]Is there rain out the window?
[45:31.81]Compared to where my anything is.
[45:34.24]Look at that.
[45:53.65]All I can make of monsters and fucking, like, Lovecraftian horrors.
[45:58.31]I can't do anything else.
[46:06.73]Hey, you guys laugh, and I can't do this.
[46:10.63]But, hey, don't you think I could do a pretty damn good job making, like, the next Dead Space 4 fucking enemies?
[46:16.17]I think I could.
[46:17.55]I could pull all kinds of fucking crazy shit out of my head.
[46:28.82]You know, I am available for consulting work.
[46:30.52]This is really, really good.
[46:40.03]Jerma, I'm... Jerma, you're unemployable.
[46:45.47]Oh, you know me so well.
[46:47.93]Yeah.
[46:49.47]Yeah, you're unemployable.
[46:51.35]Yeah, I know you.
[46:53.12]Yeah, I know you.
[46:55.08]What do you know?
[46:56.16]What do you know?
[46:59.87]He struck a chord there.
[47:01.91]How would you know that?
[47:03.58]You don't know!
[47:06.08]Ethan's house, upstairs.
[47:13.93]Press X to go downstairs.
[47:16.01]Who's Ethan?
[47:20.07]He's actually mad.
[47:22.52]No, but you can't make an assessment on some- okay, let me tell you something.
[47:26.88]You cannot make an assessment on somebody's career aspirations or abilities based on them playing Dreams for fucking three hours.
[47:37.78]I- I- okay, if I handed you a controller and I took- and you were Bill Gates,
[47:43.09]Like, 25 years ago, Bill Gates, and you're like, Bill Gates, can you, like, make a sculpture in Dreams?
[47:49.61]And he'd be like, I don't understand what you want me to do here.
[47:53.34]He'd make a fucking worm.
[47:55.36]I made a worm there now, didn't I?
[47:57.28]Yeah, you did, you did.
[47:58.50]You did, Bill.
[47:59.80]Interesting.
[48:01.46]No, no, Bill, you can't, you zoomed in, you zoomed out, you zoomed in.
[48:04.48]Oh, well, sorry about that.
[48:05.68]I thought I, the controls are kind of hard.
[48:09.85]I put a face on that worm, didn't I?
[48:11.27]And it looks bad, but you're like, oh, nice job, Bill.
[48:13.28]Is Bill Gates unemployable because he can't... Bill Gates is unemployable.
[48:29.87]You're right.
[48:30.35]You're just like Bill Gates.
[48:31.63]Thank you.
[48:39.54]Good morning, Lou.
[48:41.58]I love the badge.
[48:42.26]Jeffrey.
[48:43.84]Got my hands full here.
[48:46.40]Swapped.
[48:47.78]I'm telling you.
[48:50.04]Well, that's why I'm here.
[48:51.86]For you.
[48:53.28]Brams County can lend a cop or two for a neighboring town in need.
[48:57.98]So, what are we looking at?
[48:59.00]That was the voice I was just doing.
[49:01.00]For Bill Gates.
[49:01.58]This is Bill Gates talking to us.
[49:02.58]Henry Sullivan.
[49:03.76]Shot his family dead last night, then hung himself in the garage.
[49:08.21]Lisa Belinsky, his wife, shot in the stomach.
[49:13.70]And ragged.
[49:15.64]Dear God.
[49:17.90]It's just getting worse.
[49:19.50]It's like the whole city is losing its mind.
[49:24.26]They had to make all this shit.
[49:25.95]They had to do all day to put it in the right place.
[49:27.83]They had to put a desk here.
[49:28.79]He's upstairs.
[49:29.17]Let's go.
[49:33.55]Now, they don't have to make every single thing, because obviously the game has a clothing feature.
[49:37.07]You have to make it once, and then you can use it over and over again.
[49:40.63]And change the color on it, too.
[49:52.23]Ethan's house downstairs.
[49:53.91]Is this supposed to be this person's house?
[50:01.69]Is this Pokémon?
[50:05.10]Professor Elm has been waiting for you, dear.
[50:10.48]The only reason why I knew that is because of the backwards hat.
[50:13.54]I didn't... I could not tell... If he didn't have the hat on, I wouldn't know this is a Pokémon game.
[50:25.97]The music?
[50:26.65]I've never played Pokémon.
[50:28.37]Here's another Sonic.
[50:35.12]This is a pretty good Sonic.
[50:41.73]I dare say that this may be the best Sonic we've seen so far.
[50:46.25]Might even be the same one.
[50:53.46]Here's the interrogation.
[50:54.48]We're gonna get a lot of Silent Hills.
[51:05.51]What's your name, sir?
[51:08.57]Tom Sanders.
[51:16.12]How well did you know him?
[51:17.32]Did he seem different?
[51:18.28]Any possible motives?
[51:19.38]Any possible motives?
[51:22.48]I can't think of any.
[51:26.24]Did he seem different lately?
[51:28.64]He had been down for a while after losing his job.
[51:32.22]But that was nothing new.
[51:33.34]This just came so suddenly.
[51:39.61]How well did you know him?
[51:41.55]We go back a long time.
[51:42.89]And then he fucking tosses the table over like a Lovecraftian Jerma-created horror comes out of his mouth.
[51:50.28]I know talent when I see it.
[51:51.34]Could you tell us about... It's strange, though.
[51:55.16]It's happening everywhere now, doesn't it?
[51:58.35]All over town?
[52:00.61]Yeah, it's a real head-buster, I'll give you that.
[52:03.19]But, uh... Maybe it shouldn't surprise us.
[52:05.85]Oh, yeah?
[52:06.35]Why's that?
[52:09.72]It's freaky.
[52:11.00]This guy's scary.
[52:12.04]I have been looking around me lately.
[52:14.78]The mood is different.
[52:16.56]People seem so on edge.
[52:19.12]So many have ended up on the streets recently.
[52:21.14]Does this happen in Silent Hill?
[52:23.36]Economy's going through tough times.
[52:25.86]Takes more than that to start a riot like this.
[52:29.12]There could be more to it than just that.
[52:32.15]I'm sorry, exactly how did you know Henry Sullivan again?
[52:38.59]Yeah?
[52:40.15]Those photos you requested, sir.
[52:44.54]Ah yeah, the photos of the crime scene I asked for.
[52:47.90]They're in the photo lab.
[52:50.00]Realistic knocking.
[52:53.72]We'll talk later, Tom.
[53:00.24]That was not me.
[53:06.33]New Bark Town.
[53:07.21]Another dog game.
[53:08.27]I can't wait.
[53:09.59]I love the dog ones.
[53:10.37]They're the best.
[53:13.61]Oh no, shit.
[53:17.40]I made that sound like I didn't think this one was good.
[53:20.02]I meant like I thought it was going to be a dog one.
[53:26.06]Ooh, this is nice.
[53:27.24]This is a pretty cool town.
[53:40.00]So you know when you play, and you just realize you have this moment in your brain where you understand how everything works now?
[53:49.17]I do.
[53:50.61]I remember I was asking about lighting.
[53:53.22]And how do I turn on the lights?
[53:54.52]What do I do about the lights and lighting?
[53:57.48]It's the glow tool.
[53:58.42]That's it.
[53:59.42]You can make anything a light.
[54:02.80]I thought that you had to stage it.
[54:05.56]No, it's just the glow tool that's it.
[54:08.32]Anything can be a light.
[54:09.85]Anything can emit light.
[54:12.23]You can make light any color.
[54:17.56]And you can aim it.
[54:26.47]Well, what is this?
[54:28.41]Is this a... Oh, that's a... Rat... What's it?
[54:30.93]Rat?
[54:31.85]Rataska?
[54:33.05]Ratatouille?
[54:34.03]Ratato?
[54:35.85]Ratatouille?
[54:36.51]What is it?
[54:36.85]What is it called?
[54:39.53]Hmm...
[54:54.38]Tabasco?
[54:55.18]The best sauce ever made.
[54:58.75]This is... I can't even go in here.
[55:00.51]Look at how huge I am.
[55:08.54]Ratabasco.
[55:13.44]Ratatouille.
[55:16.13]Ratabasco.
[55:19.61]Rataska!
[55:21.41]Raticaster Brown!
[55:22.53]What are the Bratz?
[55:28.68]This is really cool.
[55:29.66]You get a thumbs up from me.
[55:33.34]Tabasco is fucking disgusting.
[55:34.82]It is not.
[55:40.88]If you really think Tabasco is disgusting, then you and I are no longer good friends.
[55:45.02]We're now kind of fun friends, not good ones.
[55:50.43]Wait, no.
[55:51.63]Remix of Silent... Wait, what do you mean remix?
[55:57.27]I can hear them calling to me from hell.
[55:59.75]I used to do that when I was younger.
[56:00.69]I would forget a word in the sentence.
[56:05.19]And I would put it above and point an arrow down.
[56:12.12]I can hear them calling to me from hell.
[56:16.36]Forgive me, Lisa.
[56:17.94]There's a monster inside of me.
[56:21.99]Oh, boy.
[56:24.49]They always write those things.
[56:26.82]I sent more info on this guy to your email.
[56:29.68]You're living in that hotel?
[56:31.02]You know what the worst thing in the world is?
[56:34.08]I'll check out the info.
[56:35.54]What we're describing here, what we're talking about now.
[56:40.73]I do this shit on checks, and it makes me so self-conscious, and I feel like I hate it.
[56:49.97]I will write a check to somebody, and it'll be like, oh, who am I writing that to?
[56:52.75]Oh, you're writing it to, uh, uh, B&B Associates, uh, LLC, or something.
[56:58.94]And it's like, ah, fuck, why do you have to have such a goddamn long name?
[57:02.60]And I'll write the check out, and I'll get to the end of the line.
[57:07.72]And I'll, it'll, I'll have, like, the S in Associates written out.
[57:11.90]And I'll have to do, make tiny, tiny little letters and trail it off like it falls off the cliff.
[57:20.72]And don't even get me started if it's a weird, uneven number.
[57:24.61]Like, $422.68.
[57:24.85]It's just like, fuck, do I have to write this whole thing out?
[57:28.41]Can I just give it to you?
[57:30.03]Can't you just make it like $400?
[57:31.27]Or like $200?
[57:31.51]Or like $1,000?
[57:31.75]Why is it always like, ah, that's, uh, $1,344.52.
[57:32.69]I don't want to write that whole thing out.
[57:36.28]You have to write the whole thing.
[57:53.66]No, not even numbers as in like, I'm talking about like an easy, flat number to write out.
[57:58.92]Have you guys ever written a check before?
[58:01.36]No, how many of you guys have ever written a fucking check?
[58:12.23]This is wonderful.
[58:22.08]This is really good.
[58:23.48]I love the coral reef.
[58:26.34]And the little astronaut guy.
[58:27.70]The little underwater scuba guy.
[58:34.42]Balance your checkbook.
[58:35.78]No, I'm asking about writing checks.
[58:39.60]To a group of... Oh, he's dead.
[58:41.94]To a group of people that probably have never done it before.
[58:45.10]I forgot, we're in the digital age.
[58:57.90]Made it.
[59:01.46]I'm a digital zoomer.
[59:05.18]Ooh, that was bad.
[59:11.42]Some people only take checks, though.
[59:12.86]I find that hard to believe.
[59:14.93]Alright, so let me give you a scenario.
[59:21.69]Most of the time, still, even in the digital zoomer age,
[59:26.70]If, like, a plumber comes to your house, you gotta pay them, how do you pay them?
[59:31.77]They don't have, like, a card swiper.
[59:33.79]Most of them have just, like, gotta be a check.
[59:36.37]Cash.
[59:40.29]Oh, shit, my phone.
[59:44.65]Alright, so, but what if the job you're paying for is, like, hundreds of dollars?
[59:49.30]Do you just, like, withdraw, like, fucking $800 in cash?
[59:52.64]And, like, there you go, there's, like, eight hundreds.
[60:06.92]Why not?
[60:07.38]Yeah, but then you can't prove it.
[60:13.40]If you pay for a service in cash, that money's gone.
[60:32.05]Receipt?
[60:33.77]What plumber's gonna give you a receipt?
[60:37.16]Never happened to me before.
[60:53.77]Oh, this is cool.
[60:57.51]I know, I'm just fucking around.
[61:04.31]Actual swinging animations, this is cool.
[61:13.87]Cell F?
[61:22.05]Bad plumbers.
[61:29.03]Nah, to be real though, I don't ever carry cash.
[61:31.93]It's a hazard.
[61:37.37]Was that... Oh, this spider even has the oof.
[61:42.49]It's a pretty cool spider though.
[61:53.28]Is that the quest?
[61:55.74]List of prisoners.
[61:56.80]John.
[61:57.68]Murder.
[61:58.26]Cell B. Empty.
[61:59.58]Cell C. Brigitte.
[62:01.03]Theft.
[62:02.19]Cell E. David.
[62:03.15]Murder.
[62:03.55]Cell F. Censored.
[62:05.76]Let's go check on Kevin.
[62:06.68]It's okay.
[62:07.28]Why would you get arrested for gambling?
[62:10.11]Dead for conspiracy.
[62:36.76]Illegal gambling.
[62:37.94]Oh, okay.
[62:41.27]Cell block.
[62:43.67]Isn't this one?
[62:47.45]Shift schedule.
[62:48.23]6 a.m., 2 p.m., 2 p.m., 10 p.m., 10 p.m., 6 a.m.
[62:50.33]No, please stop using empty cell L as a storage for your items.
[62:53.75]Thanks.
[62:54.23]From the captain.
[62:55.83]Well, I picked it up.
[62:56.45]It was a health potion.
[63:05.71]Sleeping quarters.
[63:11.47]That's actually scary how that moves.
[63:17.35]You and the captain make it happen.
[63:19.89]Captain Crunch!
[63:22.34]My Crunch Berries!
[63:25.62]I had trouble sleeping tonight again.
[63:27.32]Another nightmare about monsters attacking our fort.
[63:42.01]Kitchen.
[63:43.72]You gotta start... Yeah, you're right.
[63:50.68]Oh, fuck.
[63:52.06]I fucked up big time.
[63:55.36]Oh, no.
[63:57.86]What am I thinking?
[64:00.64]I'm doing, like, American humor.
[64:03.20]And American references.
[64:05.62]That's not gonna work right now.
[64:11.61]Fuck.
[64:13.55]I guess they're doing some, like, EU references and, like, British and Jerma, Lithuanian humor.
[64:20.37]What do you guys think is funny?
[64:21.45]I don't know.
[64:22.33]I've never even spoken to you guys before.
[64:23.81]It's been a long time.
[64:31.57]This is like going and being, like, a comedian and going to, like, do stand-up.
[64:35.96]And you look out, you, you, you, you, you, wait, where am I doing my next show?
[64:44.07]Oh, we're getting you on a plane.
[64:45.01]You're going to Germany.
[64:46.49]What?
[64:48.87]Yeah, none of your material is going to work.
[64:51.17]Okay, um... I can figure something out.
[64:56.31]You really bombed with that N.A.
[64:57.65]check joke.
[64:58.31]I know, right?
[64:59.05]That's the... I thought that was going to fly over really well.
[65:05.98]Current inventory.
[65:06.48]A bunch of apples.
[65:07.38]Two healing potions.
[65:08.66]Someone please order more food immediately.
[65:11.82]This captain sounds pretty, uh...
[65:21.32]The EU is like five years more advanced than America.
[65:24.08]I don't know if I believe that.
[65:27.72]Five?
[65:34.63]Like, you're talking to an American right now.
[65:37.33]You think I'm going to stand for that?
[65:39.25]You think I'm going to let that just fly and you're going to come after and attack my country?
[65:44.59]A country who every single business you've gone into in the last at least five years are still running on Dell computers and Windows XP.
[65:58.24]You think you're five to ten years ahead of us Americans?
[66:01.16]Are you out of your mind?
[66:02.04]These skeletons are actually really well-made.
[66:16.15]So it's actually kind of funny.
[66:17.93]This is a universal humor.
[66:19.25]This has nothing to do with where you're from.
[66:21.59]Right?
[66:22.45]Let's see.
[66:22.71]Tell me how this one flies.
[66:23.57]It's a reference to what we were just talking about.
[66:26.37]So I was at the bank.
[66:27.91]And this actually happened.
[66:30.41]I was setting up some account stuff.
[66:32.19]I was squaring away some account details.
[66:34.79]And this is a giant boss room.
[66:36.57]So hold on.
[66:38.41]You guys have banks in the EU, right?
[66:40.42]Yeah.
[66:40.66]So I'm already off to great stuff, as you can see.
[66:47.48]Hold on, I gotta make sure I don't die to the finale.
[66:54.22]But anyways, so... I was having my... Uh oh, I'm gonna die.
[67:05.61]EU uses only Apple Pay.
[67:10.14]An American company, I see!
[67:19.13]Come on!
[67:21.41]No!
[67:22.79]No!
[67:32.47]That's it.
[67:33.65]That didn't do it.
[67:36.36]I have done too long, too long NA, you know, too long North American.
[67:44.34]What's going on?
[67:45.70]Alright, T-L-D-R-E-U.
[67:50.45]I went to the bank and they were on a Dell computer and the computer crashed in the middle of doing my information.
[67:56.47]And the guy was really upset.
[67:58.29]He's like, I can't believe this is happening, man.
[68:00.97]Like, what the fuck?
[68:01.65]Why does this have to happen?
[68:02.89]I'm like, I don't worry about it.
[68:03.95]And then I just was curious.
[68:18.32]Okay.
[68:21.95]I did it.
[68:27.23]I was just curious.
[68:30.58]So I asked him, I said, what are you running on that's causing this many problems?
[68:34.84]And this is the really scary shit that I... Think about this.
[68:38.28]Really wrap your mind around this shit.
[68:41.28]So this person told me that his browser crashes all the time.
[68:47.10]He's on Windows XP, probably no security updates in a fucking decade.
[68:54.72]And it was an old Dell computer.
[68:57.47]And I'm just sitting there thinking like, this is like banking information.
[69:04.21]Your browser is crashing.
[69:05.93]Your browser is crashing.
[69:09.98]I almost wanted to be like, can you like get out of the way for a minute and like sit in his chair and fix his computer?
[69:20.01]But if that's the case, and they were very, very adamant to tell me that this bank was not going to give them updates and give them new computers and stuff.
[69:30.78]I'm just sitting there going, you take, how these, oh, I can't believe it.
[69:34.80]How did that major breach happen?
[69:37.30]Hmm, I don't know.
[69:38.74]Maybe it's because this guy had Bonzi Buddy installed on his computer and it infected the entire fucking network of like 8 million customers.
[69:48.99]What?
[69:49.17]What?
[69:56.67]I couldn't believe it.
[70:01.77]Yeah, well, we here at Bank X, yeah, we take security very seriously.
[70:09.48]We have an entire team of people that make up, like, at least four to five, probably a million dollars in salaries.
[70:19.30]Your salary is very important.
[70:21.82]Your security is very important to us.
[70:26.16]Oh, yeah?
[70:27.25]Yeah.
[70:28.97]Can you give all your branches new computers with updated Windows security fixes?
[70:34.94]No.
[70:36.44]No, I don't think so.
[70:38.26]Why?
[70:38.52]It costs too much money.
[70:41.12]We have security experts.
[70:44.58]We pay the security experts.
[70:48.62]I don't know what they do, but they are experts at it.
[70:55.10]Can you at least give them Windows 7?
[70:58.06]How much that gotta cost?
[70:59.38]I don't know.
[71:00.08]Is it worth that or worth like 10 million customers data breach because of a browser hijacker?
[71:08.41]I don't get it.
[71:09.01]I never will.
[71:11.59]And the EU crowd fucking loves this shit.
[71:13.33]You know what I mean?
[71:13.75]Because like EU... I gotta make this jump.
[71:21.98]Next game.
[71:22.30]No, no, no, wait.
[71:22.76]I have to make this jump.
[71:33.40]They made this one really hard.
[71:43.70]But it honestly makes no sense.
[71:57.08]That one's unfinished.
[71:58.08]That's it.
[72:00.62]Fall damage from spawning in.
[72:12.89]Factory run.
[72:13.75]Let's try this one.
[72:14.41]But no, like... We take security very seriously.
[72:20.46]Can I just call and... Yeah, I'm gonna use social engineering to trick one of your customer service agents.
[72:31.85]Hi, yes, Bank X. Hi.
[72:36.30]I'd like to make a withdrawal, please.
[72:39.74]Okay.
[72:41.02]Who am I speaking to?
[72:44.74]Jeremy Elbertson.
[72:47.22]Okay.
[72:47.86]Just for security purposes, I want to make sure that we get this and make sure we know who you are.
[72:52.64]By the way, replace this with any fucking company.
[72:55.18]Any company that has a feature like this.
[72:57.43]Can you do me a favor and verify your first and last name?
[73:03.14]Jeremy Elbertson.
[73:04.68]Okay.
[73:05.52]Alright.
[73:06.08]Just making sure I'm talking to the right person.
[73:07.76]What would you like to do today?
[73:15.80]Take everything.
[73:17.88]Okay.
[73:18.24]Take everything.
[73:19.19]Okay.
[73:20.27]Let me just turn to my page in my script.
[73:25.09]Okay.
[73:25.43]To take everything, I'm going to need a little bit more verifiable information.
[73:30.05]I'm going to need the last four digits of your phone number.
[73:38.50]Oh, thank God I know I'm talking to the right person now.
[73:54.55]Sure.
[74:00.74]Through space.
[74:11.57]Look at this ship.
[74:16.95]But it's true, though.
[74:18.29]All these companies claim to have... Oh, we take security seriously.
[74:22.40]No, you don't.
[74:23.24]Stop.
[74:23.52]Shut up.
[74:24.92]It's bullshit.
[74:29.51]Somebody, you know, people, like, people, okay, if it's possible for somebody to walk into, like, a Target or, like, a gas station and literally put, like, a credit card skimmer in their machine, I don't think they're paying that much attention to it.
[74:50.14]Hold on, did somebody swipe 500 credit cards?
[74:54.96]Oh, there was a skimmer in this ATM.
[74:59.62]Whoops.
[75:02.20]How did that get there?
[75:03.39]Pull it out.
[75:07.81]This is really cool.
[75:15.33]This is a full space station.
[75:21.96]People tap people's pockets with contactless credit card bridges and take loads of money to time.
[75:27.35]I know, it's scary though, you know what I mean?
[75:35.27]You gotta be careful.
[75:36.89]Under construction.
[75:37.61]Let's just check this out.
[75:44.24]Here's the crazy part about the chip, right?
[75:46.72]A lot of people don't take the chip.
[75:51.27]A ton of retailers don't do the chip.
[75:57.53]This is cool.
[76:01.64]And they even have a thing on the device that says, chip reader not functioning.
[76:08.20]Please swipe.
[76:08.93]What do you mean it's not functioning?
[76:11.45]It's broken.
[76:11.71]What are you talking about?
[76:18.45]Welcome to Through Space.
[76:20.13]For now, it's just a dream.
[76:22.55]I'm building this environment and doing some experimentation, but Through Space will eventually evolve to a story-driven sci-fi game.
[76:30.00]Gradually, lore and more detail will be added.
[76:32.60]Keep in touch.
[76:37.57]Oh, I could have just pressed the triangle.
[76:41.21]Chips mean fries for EU.
[76:43.01]Fuck, you're right.
[76:43.77]I meant, um, a credit card, um, internal chip.
[76:50.92]Like, computer chip.
[76:53.74]This is actually really nice.
[76:55.24]I like the ground, too.
[76:58.44]Oh, now I get it.
[76:59.74]Dude, he's just slaying this EU audience.
[77:08.65]Computer fries.
[77:12.86]I like this one.
[77:14.31]Good job.
[77:15.39]Very good job.
[77:19.19]You can say Europe, Jeremy.
[77:21.43]EU is just a treaty.
[77:23.33]Alright, well, excuse me, hold on a second.
[77:31.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[77:33.46]Then why do you call it NA?
[77:37.28]North America is more than one country.
[77:41.49]So, excuse me.
[78:09.57]Europe is not EU?
[78:10.85]What are you talking about?
[78:19.31]What are you talking about?
[78:29.81]NA is a shitload of countries.
[78:32.99]What are you talking about?
[78:44.60]Are people just fucking with me here?
[78:54.49]Oh, I see.
[78:55.15]I thought you guys were fucking with me.
[79:05.68]Didn't we already see this?
[79:10.78]Is it because I said North America and everyone just thinks North America is America?
[79:14.36]I forgot, EU audience.
[79:15.84]I did say North America.
[79:16.96]NA is like three countries.
[79:23.97]Alright, now you've just proven that you don't know.
[79:31.07]It's like 30.
[79:31.43]Or 40, at least.
[79:33.89]Can I not go in any of these doors?
[79:47.21]This is cool.
[79:51.47]It's twenty... twenty-three, what did I say, thirty?
[79:54.90]Thir... I... wha... I didn't know that I don't have the exact number of countries in North America.
[79:59.68]I thought it was like twenty-seven.
[80:05.44]This is... This is the first game I've played that has a really well-made third-person swinging animations.
[80:17.87]Central America is North America.
[80:19.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[80:21.37]Yeah, it's a hemisphere.
[80:26.89]This is fantastic.
[80:27.81]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[80:43.40]Aerial attack?
[80:44.28]Jump attack?
[80:47.99]A lot of work went into this.
[80:49.75]This is really good.
[80:56.76]Hold, this is block.
[80:58.34]Crouch.
[80:59.58]This looks like a little prototype.
[81:00.86]Focus camera and lock on.
[81:02.36]Wow!
[81:08.56]Somebody's gonna make something awesome.
[81:13.55]Hold L2 and then backflip.
[81:17.43]So this is a Zelda game.
[81:20.11]There's even more.
[81:22.87]Sprint.
[81:24.69]A roll.
[81:25.93]Oh, yeah.
[81:28.23]Finish your attack after one second sprint.
[81:34.63]Sprint dive.
[81:42.08]What is this one?
[81:43.52]This is just...
[81:47.39]Okay.
[81:51.27]Uh, so there is a suicide button.
[81:55.37]I guess.
[82:01.53]Looks like they're gonna have enemies scattered around.
[82:06.93]This is really well done.
[82:08.87]Could I give this a thumbs up plus?
[82:12.01]Can I give this more than a thumbs up?
[82:15.20]Because this is obviously somebody that knows exactly what the fuck they're doing.
[82:18.96]This is probably a... This is a dev.
[82:20.94]This is a dev.
[82:22.52]And I put that in huge brackets.
[82:27.72]Like, this is a dev.
[82:33.24]You can tell.
[82:33.64]You can just tell they know exactly what's going on.
[82:42.84]Like in quotes.
[82:43.54]Like, dev.
[82:50.63]Nice job.
[82:59.14]Pixel Plaza.
[83:05.46]I don't like this.
[83:07.12]I don't like this one.
[83:08.80]This one gives me a headache.
[83:11.94]I gotta get out.
[83:13.13]I can't do that one.
[83:21.41]Boom Balls, Hub 1.
[83:24.98]Review Tubes Games presents a very small percentage of the video made through the Athletic Seizure from Black Earth and Spoke Certain Life.
[83:30.06]We've got a warning for this one, but not the last one.
[83:33.70]That was a seizure warning at the bottom, but not the last one.
[83:37.88]Well, it's there, I just don't know why.
[83:47.12]Um...
[83:55.39]This is really, really good.
[83:59.20]Oh, shit.
[84:01.38]Trench bucket intro scene.
[84:07.82]Another super quotes dev.
[84:11.12]I don't mean that as like a mean, annoying way to be like, oh, yeah, a dev quotes, right?
[84:20.71]Cable car?
[84:21.47]Hmm.
[84:25.06]So.
[84:27.78]Strange time of the year to be going up in the mountains, isn't it?
[84:32.14]What are you doing here?
[84:33.12]None of your business.
[84:33.84]Pretend I didn't hear.
[84:36.60]But they do get deaf young these days, don't they?
[84:41.10]Don't they?
[84:42.84]He's trying to goad me into a conversation.
[84:48.16]Not on my watch.
[84:48.98]These lips are staying tightly closed, mister.
[84:57.11]Looks like it's my stop.
[84:59.17]Ha!
[84:59.77]I win.
[85:07.14]If I had the skill to do it, I would just take the first, like, eight pages that I wrote of the book and make it a game.
[85:25.22]Oh, it looks like my stuff isn't far away either.
[85:26.88]Finally, who knew a two-hour cable car could take so long?
[85:34.90]I'm a dev.
[85:36.18]I can do it.
[85:39.40]Boom balls.
[85:40.12]Fight three.
[85:40.66]Level one.
[85:43.66]And... Start!
[85:48.02]Press and hold X to explode.
[85:56.61]Oh, I get it.
[85:58.41]It's a chain reaction game.
[86:03.42]Flawless.
[86:10.76]Galactic Geometry Dream Evolved.
[86:13.32]Coming soon.
[86:13.80]Advanced scoring system.
[86:15.12]Many update notes.
[86:16.02]Bug fixes.
[86:17.30]Spawn invincibility added.
[86:18.58]Update 04.
[86:19.36]Spawning patterns.
[86:20.64]Score chasers.
[86:21.26]Be aware that future updates... Okay.
[86:26.39]The peak.
[86:37.54]Wow.
[86:42.55]Some of you guys are talking shit about this one.
[86:45.57]You sure about that?
[86:47.11]I can check my pockets in any notes I've made using the touchpad.
[86:51.89]I can look at my messages too.
[86:54.69]Come to think of it, didn't someone message me on the cable car?
[86:58.93]Wanna see if there's fall damage.
[87:05.28]Mobile phone.
[87:05.98]Cable car ticket.
[87:07.44]My one line of communication with the outside world.
[87:10.54]Mobile phone.
[87:11.82]Check my messages on a different page.
[87:16.05]Messages from Mum.
[87:18.95]Are you alright?
[87:19.51]Is your phone out of battery?
[87:22.72]Just checking in.
[87:23.44]Hi, sweetie.
[87:23.88]How are you?
[87:24.96]I just dropped by your flat to say hello, but you won't get the EU crowd.
[87:28.37]Loving this one.
[87:29.95]Just dropped by your flat to say hello, but you weren't in.
[87:33.27]When I asked old Giuseppe next door, he said he hadn't seen you for a few days.
[87:40.25]Have you gone on another one of your trips?
[87:43.16]You don't need to tell me everything you do, but a bit of a heads up would be nice.
[87:47.56]Please give me a ring soon.
[87:48.70]Love, Mom.
[87:54.42]The EU crowd is loving this stream right now.
[87:59.87]How's your mom?
[88:09.94]My mom is doing good.
[88:12.08]This is beautiful.
[88:13.06]Perfect.
[88:14.12]Wonderful.
[88:16.80]I envy being able to do this.
[88:19.39]Envy it.
[88:22.29]EU is not British.
[88:24.43]Oh, yeah.
[88:24.91]Oh, right.
[88:26.67]Ring, ring.
[88:27.39]Ring, ring.
[88:29.61]Looks like my phone's ringing.
[88:32.03]It's from Gregory, sweet cheeks.
[88:34.38]We really need to have a serious talk.
[88:37.75]I've taken a glance over your focus group report and I must say, I'm not pleased by what I saw.
[88:43.07]I can see a pattern emerging in your work.
[88:45.33]It's not a good one.
[88:47.27]I'm afraid to say that this is not acceptable.
[88:49.25]And you will need to step it up a little bit here.
[88:51.79]You're going to have to put in extra hours to complete.
[88:55.39]Unacceptable!
[88:57.50]My behind!
[88:59.42]He should have seen what I had to work with.
[89:02.20]I work late all of last week to get in more finish and this is what I get?
[89:05.38]More overtime at a glance?
[89:06.98]The nerve of this fucking mate.
[89:09.10]Well, whatever.
[89:10.15]I'm on holiday.
[89:11.17]Work can wait.
[89:24.19]Ring ring.
[89:24.85]Oh, ring ring.
[89:27.07]Again.
[89:29.69]We really need to have a serious talk.
[89:32.25]Ha, ha.
[89:33.11]I meant going, not gone.
[89:35.49]LOL.
[89:37.17]What part of holiday leave does this man not understand?
[89:39.83]Alright, so this is what's happening right now is when I'm trying to do this in real time.
[89:45.87]You have an accent slider and you're playing back the audio clip with me talking and you are sliding from like Cockney British over to Irish back and forth a few times.
[89:58.20]Mid-sentence.
[90:10.14]And Australian, yeah.
[90:15.57]Looks like the... Should I go in?
[90:17.91]Go!
[90:18.73]Go in!
[90:23.29]Boom falls, level two.
[90:27.79]Oh, sorry, boom crisps, level two.
[90:30.05]Fucking EU crowds loving it.
[90:33.63]Alright, alright, I'm... I've had my fill.
[90:36.29]I've had my fill.
[90:39.86]With those references, I'm not doing anything First try, come on No!
[90:54.77]Short Final Done 2, that's a Jeremy title Holy shit, look at that over on the right, look at the eyes
[91:31.96]And this is the peasant voice?
[91:33.21]What do you mean peasant voice?
[91:37.42]I like that fire effect.
[92:09.50]Have I looked to see if anyone made anything new today?
[92:11.50]No.
[92:12.66]Not yet.
[92:13.92]I'll do that before the stream ends.
[92:17.93]We will check.
[92:18.47]Dude, look at this dude!
[92:38.80]Just waiting for the oof.
[93:00.84]I like this one.
[93:04.01]I just saw a ResidentSleeper in chat.
[93:06.54]No, I like this one.
[93:07.60]Look at the rain.
[93:08.12]Look at the background.
[93:08.94]Look at the blending that's going on in the background here.
[93:13.04]Come on.
[93:41.69]I don't get it.
[93:42.43]I'll help you understand.
[93:43.69]So the kind of tall mummy guy was Britain and the fire was the EU and they really want to bring them up.
[93:53.62]I said I wasn't gonna do it anymore.
[93:59.85]Come on, this is my one opportunity.
[94:03.41]In like months.
[94:07.99]Look, I'm so... I haven't been able to talk about, like... I haven't been able to say the word Brexit.
[94:12.91]Is this still a thing?
[94:13.73]I don't know.
[94:15.01]Is it?
[94:19.13]One Punch Man Stage 1.
[94:20.17]Monster!
[94:21.19]Let's go!
[94:33.12]I ate too much crab and turned into this crab latte!
[94:40.12]Since we have that in common, I'm gonna let you live!
[94:43.17]I'm gonna rip his arms off.
[94:51.31]Okay.
[94:54.90]What are you looking at?
[94:57.10]A big chin brat, if he's caught.
[95:00.40]Hey kid, were you messing with a crab monster?
[95:04.30]He was asleep in the park, I just drew some nipples on his chest!
[95:09.17]Found you!
[95:14.67]Okay.
[95:20.51]Losing in one punch man!
[95:28.56]All I have to do is punch him once!
[95:31.60]It's the title of the show!
[95:37.28]Dodge left?
[95:45.98]I just have to do the show's title.
[95:51.40]I did- I'm pr- I'm punching!
[95:53.34]It's not hitting him, watch.
[95:59.54]I just punched- it's not one punch man, is it?
[96:04.53]It was three punch man.
[96:07.47]It's our- I KNOW IT'S OUR ONE!
[96:09.97]I KNOW IT'S OUR ONE!
[96:12.07]I KNOW!
[96:13.01]I KNOW!
[96:18.43]I- Noooo!
[96:23.38]Naughty Bear.
[96:25.08]Hello, this is just the house set so far.
[96:26.78]I will have more details and features later.
[96:30.58]Possible features, co-op, multiplayer, fights, and aversion, cops and robbers.
[96:36.59]I played this game on stream for 10 minutes.
[96:45.95]Please follow Project Viewer.
[96:46.99]Fan of Naughty Bear.
[96:49.66]I didn't know there were fans of Naughty Bear.
[96:52.72]Better crouch, no auto-jump, more plant types, detail touch-up, item interaction, and weapons.
[97:00.80]Didn't pick up the gift.
[97:01.46]I don't think I can pick up the gift.
[97:06.96]Beachside will be redone.
[97:09.40]This is nice.
[97:11.04]Sound test.
[97:11.98]Boo.
[97:13.82]That scared the fuck out of me.
[97:20.24]Listen to this.
[97:23.12]It comes out of the controller, too.
[97:27.19]Oh my god, that was... Sound test successful, yeah.
[97:37.27]This is really well-made beach.
[97:41.45]You got some good foliage.
[97:43.63]But let's, uh... Let's see.
[97:45.55]Oh, you made sure that you put invisible walls up.
[97:47.81]Good for you.
[97:49.19]Nice work.
[97:49.65]Because I was about to go look at it on the other side and see your assets that you accidentally painted over here.
[97:55.31]But you're a good game dev and you may be not able to.
[98:00.09]Oh, this is nice.
[98:00.59]I mean, it looks good.
[98:08.90]This little campfire is cool.
[98:12.20]The logs.
[98:15.50]Now you'll notice a true sculptor at work here because those are the cylinder shape that had been hollowed out.
[98:23.89]But instead of just doing that, painting them brown and maneuvering them and putting them in the fire, do you see the etchings on the logs?
[98:34.13]They went with the little ball tool and they sculpted out etchings.
[98:40.26]ResidentSleepers.
[98:44.64]Apparently the EU audience doesn't care about artistically inclined things.
[98:52.74]The North American audience was like all over this.
[98:55.31]Just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[99:00.77]We were talking about etchings and clay and stuff.
[99:04.05]Apparently North America was more interested in art.
[99:06.61]I'm interested.
[99:07.63]I'm learning a lot today.
[99:18.05]No one cares.
[99:31.02]EU appreciating art?
[99:32.57]LUL?
[99:33.31]What are you talking about?
[99:36.43]The art was like invented in the EU.
[99:41.01]In like the 1700s.
[99:50.14]This looks like the best view I'll be getting.
[99:51.64]I could probably just set my telescope up and wait until night now if I wanted.
[99:59.92]Not yet.
[100:00.20]I want to look around.
[100:00.72]Look at that up there.
[100:15.16]Jerma, that history major isn't working out right now.
[100:19.10]I don't have a history major.
[100:25.56]This is really, really nice.
[100:26.74]Okay, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
[100:34.71]I think this may be the cleanest, most well-designed, open dream-like area.
[100:41.69]Let's see, look down here.
[100:43.29]It's great.
[100:46.70]What did I study?
[100:47.42]That's none of your business.
[100:51.67]Anytime somebody says that's none of your business when they're talking about what they studied in school, they're embarrassed to tell you what it was.
[101:05.01]Frog studies.
[101:07.47]No, not biology.
[101:09.00]No, not zoology.
[101:10.94]Frog studies.
[101:14.90]I got scammed.
[101:15.48]I have a scam degree.
[101:16.30]Somebody scam me.
[101:23.58]I did an online fucking personality quiz.
[101:32.02]And then I got my diploma after like two or three weeks.
[101:35.59]And I thought it was real.
[101:36.41]But then thinking about how I could not be real.
[101:40.15]The dean of students was signed Barack Obama.
[101:44.47]I was like, holy shit, really?
[101:45.43]That guy didn't believe it.
[101:46.53]I was like, holy fuck, that's crazy.
[101:47.65]I was like, okay.
[101:54.90]Pick up the phone.
[101:57.18]Subject, re, re, re, we really need a serious talk.
[102:01.08]Just a quick message to let you know that you will no longer need to put in those extra hours.
[102:06.27]Look at the night sky here.
[102:08.51]Karen has been amazing and rewritten the report from scratch, so you don't need to touch it ever again.
[102:16.58]What a star.
[102:18.02]Don't forget to thank her when you get back.
[102:25.66]Oh well, that's wonderful.
[102:27.19]Good for her.
[102:28.99]Fantastic.
[102:32.29]I may as well have sat and stared into space for a week for all the difference it made.
[102:38.42]Look at that big thing up there.
[102:39.46]Another week of my life thrown into the abyss, never to be seen again.
[102:45.32]Well, if that's how it is... Just throw the phone?
[102:55.57]Oh, the stars are lovely tonight, aren't they?
[102:57.25]That looks really good.
[103:08.31]One Punch Man stage two versus super custom.
[103:10.39]This is like spoilers for the show if you haven't seen uh If you haven't seen One Punch Man, we're gonna get every fight This hasn't changed since before I became a hero I haven't made any impact I'm not necessarily sad about that
[103:35.69]But there's something bothering me lately.
[103:46.44]As the days pass, my emotions grow more distant.
[103:51.02]I guess.
[103:53.38]Fear, tension, joy, anger.
[103:56.24]I don't feel them anymore at all.
[103:59.86]I don't remember this guy's voice.
[104:04.83]I used to feel all kinds of emotions.
[104:06.92]I'm a custom car, machine killer.
[104:09.77]If you're thinking of getting in my way, I'll put a shine on that face.
[104:43.11]I just get knocked back.
[104:47.78]What do you mean I took too long?
[104:49.24]I can't... This is as fast as I can go!
[104:54.48]If I see R1 one more time... I swear!
[105:09.20]I guess all I had to do was punch him once.
[105:13.80]Oh, man.
[105:15.56]The grocery store is having a sale today.
[105:17.52]Come on, get over here.
[105:26.27]Dodge the kick?
[105:27.89]Don't tell me what to do, don't tell me what to do.
[105:38.15]Alright, I'm gonna dodge the kick.
[105:41.89]He does it immediately after.
[105:50.38]I dodged it.
[105:52.68]Just spam R1.
[105:53.98]No, I can't... Look, if I spam R1, look what he does.
[105:57.50]You have to time it.
[105:58.38]Ready?
[105:59.73]Like... now.
[106:01.57]Or... now.
[106:03.05]I did it.
[106:03.41]I just punched him!
[106:04.23]It even made the sound!
[106:11.79]Have you tried pressing R1 on the top of your DualShock?
[106:14.09]Love your stuff.
[106:17.85]This is called the car trip.
[106:23.10]One push!
[106:25.14]What is... I'm not doing this.
[106:26.40]Am I controlling this?
[106:45.98]She just crushed the... You just crushed the car with a rock with the hand animator.
[106:55.49]That was ridiculous.
[106:58.79]I like the little wavelength here.
[107:14.66]Inspector Gadget, yeah.
[107:18.19]Inspector Gadget.
[107:19.25]Okay, Penny!
[107:36.89]Gadget.
[107:37.59]Specter gadget.
[107:38.99]Specter gadget.
[108:13.54]Don't tell me to stop.
[108:17.93]You're gonna tell me to stop doing that?
[108:19.43]Wow, were you enjoying the music?
[108:30.07]I was.
[108:30.33]I probably should have stopped.
[108:42.25]Who are you?
[108:44.88]I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.
[108:46.99]I knew it.
[108:50.01]Fire looks good though, I will tell you.
[109:00.83]Does this make One Punch Man an anti-batsuit?
[109:07.89]No.
[109:07.97]We're gonna get the actual song?
[109:09.95]Can we get the song?
[109:20.12]How many... what else is he doing?

[109:33.96]Oh, god damn it!
[109:35.16]I got into the fucking fire!
[109:42.40]He didn't even do the balls that time, too.
[109:50.73]By the way, listen to when I press.
[109:54.76]Do you see after pressing how long it takes?
[110:09.06]I'll get it, I'll get it, he's gonna go down.

[111:10.30]The Desert.
[111:10.76]Do I have to drive?
[111:14.23]Oh, that was the intro for this game.
[111:18.19]Hold circle to reset if you get stuck.
[111:21.77]This has actual car damage.
[111:32.16]Of all the things you've seen today, this is absolutely the most impressive.
[111:37.64]A car that you've made in dreams, that has actual damage.
[111:42.75]There's an engine too, this is awesome.
[111:56.57]He's a donut.
[112:01.96]Get out of the way!
[112:05.84]Don't crush me.

[112:10.24]Okay, get through.
[112:17.30]Yes!
[112:20.96]This is great.
[112:21.78]I'm gonna make a car game.
[112:33.85]Off-roading?
[112:34.65]This is not really the car you want to take off-road.
[112:38.07]A sedan.
[112:40.03]Um, where do I go?
[112:43.31]Am I going the right way?
[113:00.38]I want this song.
[113:01.14]Where is this song from?
[113:05.70]Look at the engine.
[113:08.08]Wow.
[113:11.44]That's awesome.
[113:19.05]He doesn't know, he doesn't know, he doesn't know.
[113:30.18]Happy Town!
[113:32.60]Look it up, look it up.
[113:35.68]Wait, Dreamiverse Dash.
[113:37.68]I've already seen this one.
[113:38.70]In fact, I'm un-thumbs-upping it because I don't want to see it again.
[113:45.60]This really is just spoilers for the whole show.
[114:00.33]Okay, good.
[114:01.31]No nudity.
[114:08.13]This is like episode two.
[114:09.33]Yeah, this season's only like 10 episodes long, eight episodes long.
[114:15.00]This is like 20% of the whole show.
[114:29.34]Flying punch, R1.
[114:30.50]How do I do a flying punch?
[114:39.49]Oh, he's gonna clap me.
[114:40.59]Dodge, left dodge.
[114:46.24]How do I dodge this?
[114:47.50]How do you dodge him clapping in the air?
[115:01.55]Can I dodge it?
[115:05.33]Should I just do flying punch?
[115:12.37]Um, I think I have to do it right when I land.
[115:17.48]Cause I can't, so I just gotta go, now R1.
[115:24.92]R1.
[115:28.56]Oh!
[115:28.94]I didn't hit him?
[115:38.59]He keeps like banging on a trash can.
[115:42.61]I got it.
[115:53.52]That was awesome.
[115:54.80]Now we're in the happy town.
[115:56.02]Oh, I'm going to use the Mario Kart shortcut.

[116:42.40]It's fine.
[116:46.52]I'm invincible.
[116:54.75]Oh, unfair.
[116:55.71]No way for me to go through it.
[116:57.05]Unfair.
[117:06.37]Please do a reaction video to You Got That.
[117:15.91]rocks cue the rocks I feel like I'm playing stuntman bingo Prometheus FPS demo I think we've already seen this one
[117:45.51]We have seen this one.
[117:47.03]It's very good, but we've already seen it.
[117:55.98]R2.
[117:56.08]R1.
[117:56.32]Damn, good times.
[118:02.79]Yeah, good times.
[118:09.07]I believe there's also a... yep.
[118:10.71]Look at that.
[118:19.81]We've seen it already.
[118:20.55]I have already... I haven't even thumbs it up.
[118:25.46]Well, now, if I didn't thumbs it up before, I mean... I'm retroactively adding a thumbs up.
[118:31.79]I'm telling myself to thumbs this... You know what?
[118:34.07]Fine.
[118:35.11]Smash that fucking button.
[118:38.90]This is called separate reality.
[118:40.66]Watch out, the gap in the door, it's a separate reality.
[118:42.98]The only me is... Oh, man.
[118:45.81]I think we've cycled.
[118:47.77]Yeah, we've cycled back to P.T.
[118:57.65]I think we've seen them all.
[119:01.72]No, we haven't.
[119:02.84]He's in the ghost house.
[119:11.26]Let's turn it down.
[119:12.30]It's a little loud.
[119:13.08]I'm just gonna drive straight.
[119:17.10]That's... See, the developer always puts in, like, a secret, and it's just driving a straight line.
[119:38.12]Oh, this is a spooky, scary skeleton.
[119:42.56]Shivers up your spine.
[119:45.60]I know this song.
[119:56.60]Damn it.
[120:03.20]Thank God there's a checkpoint.
[120:04.46]What a good dev.
[120:07.23]Come on, Secret!
[120:16.53]I don't know why, but every time I hear this song, I always think that Tay Zonday made it.
[120:23.98]But he didn't.
[120:39.20]Yeah, Taison Day.
[120:45.65]The audio is desynced?
[120:46.97]Which one?
[120:47.45]The game audio?
[120:48.53]That doesn't make this weird.
[120:50.57]That's a nice touch.
[120:51.21]It was like the ghost.
[120:55.23]It's the game.
[120:57.61]Did that just start happening?
[120:58.53]Okay.
[121:10.89]It's been happening.
[121:12.97]Really?
[121:13.25]I don't know why it shouldn't.
[121:22.46]Yeah, we played this one already.
[121:31.16]There's cycling.
[121:34.94]See, I already thumbed that one up.
[121:37.05]Alright, so hold on.
[121:39.04]You should be hearing when it should be going right when I scroll over it.
[121:46.18]Is it not happening?
[121:56.23]It's good.
[121:56.63]It does.
[121:56.97]Yeah.
[121:57.33]So wait, I wonder what was wrong.
[121:58.57]That's weird.
[122:00.89]That's really strange.
[122:01.69]It's always something with the capture device.
[122:07.77]Loop one.
[122:09.67]Oh no, I know what this is.
[122:10.64]I'm just going to skip it immediately.
[122:11.58]I know what it is.
[122:14.06]Hit it, yeah.
[122:15.14]But, you know, for people that didn't see it the first time.
[122:19.10]Somebody made PT.
[122:19.66]But I might as well just show you the first loop.
[122:24.40]Because it's amazing that somebody did this.
[122:27.35]I agree with you.
[122:36.37]Should we just go and open that one to see how...
[123:05.48]Elevator scene.
[123:11.70]Is that amazing?
[123:12.48]It's just a one-to-one recreation of the whole game.
[123:16.46]Oh, this is the car game.
[123:20.48]Oh.
[123:34.97]A car made by Weechcraft.
[123:39.54]Story line, story by Mick Bruden.
[123:42.48]Director.
[123:47.26]Pretty good.
[123:51.06]It ain't over.
[123:55.59]What the hell?
[123:56.11]Who are you?
[123:56.61]I am evil or something.
[124:00.59]LOL.
[124:02.25]Then I'll put an end to you.
[124:04.86]Come get me!
[124:12.48]Curiosity.
[124:24.15]Oh, we saw this one too, but this is cool.
[124:27.39]Remember how I had to walk the whole thing?
[124:34.25]That looks like a car you would drive.
[124:36.75]Which one?
[124:37.17]The one with the horns?
[124:39.07]Why would I drive the one with horns?
[124:50.78]Yeah, we've cycled.
[124:53.36]We've cycled.
[124:54.30]We're getting repeats because I've seen the new ones.
[124:58.72]But we do have car game.
[125:04.32]Car game is best game.
[125:12.14]Hammer panic, yup.
[125:15.58]Remember this one?
[125:30.02]Fight till the end.
[125:37.00]There's the car.
[125:37.68]Do we have to fight saw blades?
[125:42.86]Wait, I have a machine gun now.
[125:44.53]How do I use the machine gun?
[125:48.99]X. Can I turn the gun?
[125:58.35]Is it Doom?
[125:59.68]I didn't put this on.
[126:03.64]Is it the Doom soundtrack?
[126:13.71]It is, isn't it?
[126:14.99]I'll hit the buttons.
[126:23.72]It's the Doom soundtrack.
[126:31.18]Fight to the end.
[126:31.84]Yeah, this... everyone's gonna love this now.
[126:41.29]This is the best game.
[126:51.47]Because it is.
[126:53.59]Last one.
[126:54.21]X to shoot.
[127:12.85]Jesus.
[127:13.37]I didn't think that was going to be possible.
[127:21.64]Alright, well, we're going this way.
[127:23.62]Spin around.
[127:37.46]No!
[127:37.62]The car is kind of hard to control.
[127:40.16]Did I win?
[128:02.25]Oh no, I didn't.
[128:03.29]I have to kill the boss.
[128:06.28]Is 70 health?
[128:06.88]Where'd he go?
[128:15.15]Over there.
[128:19.27]Come and get me!
[128:20.27]Do they have a gun too?
[128:23.19]This is kind of unfair.
[128:37.92]Got ya!
[128:38.74]Finish!
[128:43.62]No!
[128:44.16]We don't get to see the conclusion!
[128:46.78]Cause auto-surf is off.
[128:48.22]Wait, no!
[128:48.78]What do you mean hammer of panic?
[128:58.95]That's not the last thing I did.
[129:00.01]It's car trip, right?
[129:15.96]Let it begin.
[129:17.40]Credits.
[129:19.46]Fight till the end.
[129:20.20]Is that it?
[129:24.14]Elevator scene.
[129:26.52]Happy town.
[129:31.09]Credits.
[129:40.39]Now this is in the elevator.
[129:48.19]This is the elevator.
[129:48.95]No, it's not.
[129:51.69]Wait a minute.
[130:23.34]You are the... The music was not created by me.
[130:25.54]Check the credits list to get a hold of some amazing people.
[130:27.52]Thanks for playing.
[130:30.24]Alright, I did it.
[130:32.81]Alright, cool.
[130:39.29]Because the elevator scene is here.
[130:41.61]Right, okay.
[130:42.85]Because we didn't see that, but it was in the same car.
[130:44.75]Okay, cool.
[130:50.27]Don't take this game seriously.
[130:51.33]Have fun time on a car trip with your friends.
[130:53.73]Most of the models you'll see are not made by me, especially not the car.
[131:00.39]Yeah, that was great.
[131:04.45]Okay.
[131:06.91]Let's go back here.
[131:10.85]I leveled up.
[131:14.11]Level 16.
[131:15.07]You like to play, but recently you've been dabbling in art.
[131:18.12]This is true.
[131:20.68]You do got that right?
[131:26.80]Mario Dreams.
[131:29.26]Adding Goombas.
[131:30.22]I think we played this one.
[131:34.15]These are the top rated ones, I'm assuming, yeah.
[131:37.93]Any of these that I didn't see?
[131:38.87]I think we saw most of them.
[131:44.98]This one was really cool.
[131:47.19]Dexter's Lab.
[131:48.13]This... Wait, what happened to Cookie Clicker?
[131:53.31]What was that?
[131:56.83]Why did it just change on me?
[132:00.48]What?
[132:04.90]Uh, okay.
[132:06.82]Catboy Adventure.
[132:08.08]Panda Adventure.
[132:10.44]Panda Adventure.
[132:14.22]Interdimensional Puppet.
[132:16.12]Pepe's Adventure.
[132:19.37]Official Office Disaster.
[132:24.15]Added some dialogue and gave him a Yorkshire dialect for laughs.
[132:29.93]Shadow Man.
[132:30.75]Mini Golf Master.
[132:32.09]Follow the Light Home.
[132:38.72]You Cannot Dream.
[132:45.97]Uh, we'll try, we'll see what this is.
[132:48.45]125 thumbs up.
[132:50.48]What is it?
[133:01.66]Hello, controller, what are you doing?
[133:05.03]Oh, my controller's fucked up.
[133:10.37]Why are you doing this, controller?
[133:11.45]What the hell?
[133:17.60]There's an earthquake?
[133:27.53]The whole thing- it's like an earthquake.
[133:38.02]What, summit?
[133:39.20]Up?
[133:39.60]Down?
[133:40.24]What?
[133:48.01]Is it on like a mountain?
[133:54.09]Oh, Jesus.
[133:54.87]The water's like coming in.
[134:06.70]Is it rising?
[134:08.15]Oh, the water level is going up.
[134:10.69]I didn't even realize that.
[134:17.48]Oh, damn.
[134:23.89]Now I'll see if I see out from the other side of the roof.
[134:33.05]Can somebody translate EU?
[134:34.33]Oh, fuck.
[134:45.04]They don't know.
[134:55.80]He's dead.
[134:58.74]Nothing here?
[134:59.46]Check the other side.
[135:00.55]Okay, thank you.
[135:01.39]Fuck.
[135:13.81]Can I go down here?
[135:14.69]I guess I'm going in here.
[135:21.70]And then...
[135:25.94]Go through?
[135:27.90]The door?
[135:31.40]No, this is broken.
[135:36.91]This way?
[135:37.33]I don't think I can jump over from here.
[135:42.21]I can see on the right.
[135:49.49]Oh god.
[136:00.46]So that way.
[136:02.84]I guess I have to land on here?
[136:08.97]Come on.
[136:09.59]What?
[136:20.61]Press R1.
[136:28.25]This is really difficult to do this.
[136:32.53]The character's speed, I think, needs to be toned down.
[136:34.73]Alright, we're gonna try this again.
[136:46.60]Alright.
[136:52.02]At some point you have to accept that it's not...
[136:55.72]It's not my fault.
[136:57.34]It's not your fault.
[137:05.39]No, God, just try to... The acceleration!
[137:23.17]Because to turn around, like, you're... Okay, look.
[137:26.01]To turn around on this thing, I have to be facing... See what I mean?
[137:29.63]I have to shimmy all the way around.
[137:35.51]It's not as easy as it looks.
[137:39.49]Oh my god.
[137:46.20]That wasn't just a platform that I could walk on.
[138:10.63]That one was good.
[138:13.85]It was.
[138:14.13]It's too hard to get over there on that platform.
[138:19.00]The copy machine.
[138:27.64]Do PT?
[138:30.32]Yeah, after I last went, browse a little bit more.
[138:41.78]That's jokes.
[138:44.14]This is just me.
[138:50.40]I got a couple more monitors, though.
[138:54.20]Hot tuna.
[139:00.52]Load document.
[139:17.21]This is every VR game I've ever played.
[139:27.07]Speaker?
[139:32.81]I can't grab anything else.
[139:52.97]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[139:57.58]Get over there.
[140:00.72]Try to crash the game.
[140:03.16]Okay.
[140:04.22]Can I put two things at once?
[140:23.69]No.
[140:25.83]You can't crash the game, I don't think.
[140:27.25]I think it's deleting them as they come out.
[140:29.33]I think there's a limit that's on here.
[140:34.41]Yeah.
[140:39.91]Too smart.
[140:40.42]That's right.
[140:40.82]Thumbs that one up.
[140:46.50]The Universe of Wonders.
[140:50.00]I skipped Pepe's quest.
[140:56.38]Pepe's Adventure.
[141:06.01]We can do this one.
[141:10.45]Jump, interact, attack, and map.
[141:17.61]Oh, okay, I thought it was the little gnome guy.
[141:19.17]Attack.
[141:23.05]Attack.
[141:24.65]Jump, attack, interact, map.
[141:26.59]Oh, you can see the whole thing.
[141:34.61]Interact.
[141:35.91]Welcome, Pepe.
[141:37.14]Is it wall jump?
[141:52.61]It kind of is.
[141:53.15]I'm not sure I need it, though.
[141:59.73]Ooh, nice bird.
[142:06.09]Can I not punch the bird?
[142:09.42]I can't interact with the bird.
[142:13.28]No punching, apparently.
[142:15.72]No, he's picking me up.
[142:22.27]Okay, there's a double jump.
[142:30.25]What's this thing?
[142:31.75]Ooh, a wand!
[142:39.17]Every time a door opens, he says hello.
[142:54.46]Come on, come on!
[142:55.38]I don't have time for this!
[142:57.24]I only have like another 30 or 40 minutes to stream.
[142:59.64]Come on!
[143:06.19]Every loading minute is a wasted minute!
[143:15.09]Oh, wait, the game doesn't think I'm done.
[143:18.59]The game thinks I'm still in the game.
[143:27.32]Maybe that's it.
[143:32.23]You cannot dream.

[162:33.31]That's what I just did.
[162:34.03]Is it because I was in the surfing mode?
[162:55.09]There we go.
[162:56.01]Okay.
[162:57.05]Here we go.
[162:57.59]So, we saw this one.

[163:16.48]You in chat?
[163:21.44]You in chat?
[163:25.01]Alright, Dermot's House of Fun.

[163:31.01]Okay, I'm curious to see what this is.
[163:33.02]What, okay, let's go.
[163:34.50]Reason for that.
[163:40.44]I don't know if I can bring myself to say, because it's just going to upset a lot of people.
[163:48.45]First, before I upset a lot of people, ridiculous if you're out there somewhere thinking for 19 hours,
[163:53.60]Why do you think Alex is straight?

[164:20.22]Hey Felix, welcome back.
[164:22.36]Can you speak up?
[164:23.58]I'm eating chips.
[164:44.24]Why do I have drugs and pills everywhere?

[165:09.50]I mean, what stream is this of his?
[165:11.60]Why do I have to turn the lamp on and off?
[165:18.20]And why am I so small?
[165:18.96]We're, uh...
[165:37.44]Who is this?
[165:37.92]Is this Kim?
[165:40.38]She's not, hey.
[165:42.08]She's not gonna be happy about that.
[165:53.31]Well, thank you, Liz.
[165:54.25]This is called Jerma Comes Home.
[165:56.75]I think that's it.
[166:08.49]This is by Door Shame.

[166:23.52]Here is Rat Movie Diner.
[166:28.83]You gotta be kidding me.
[166:40.70]This is perfect.
[166:44.56]On the set of the rat movie, you can actually walk around.
[166:48.92]Oh, look at that!
[166:56.27]Look at the giant rats.
[166:57.47]This is awesome.
[167:01.85]I think it's terrifying.
[167:04.63]Nice.
[167:05.03]I love it.
[167:10.15]It's an actual one-to-one real scale.
[167:12.24]Every detail is here.
[167:17.46]The best part about this, I love the seats.
[167:21.72]The painted on fleck.
[167:24.73]It looks very accurate.
[167:27.03]Where's the knight?
[167:29.19]No knight.
[167:31.77]You want this person to make a full knight suit of armor in like two days?
[167:39.12]Come on.
[167:39.56]This is perfect.

[168:09.21]Oh, it's the rat model itself.
[168:15.92]Nice.
[168:23.72]This is pretty damn close.
[168:25.76]This is really, really close.
[168:34.09]What about Louis Cheese?
[168:35.73]Louis Cheese?
[168:41.18]Like the little one says.
[168:41.90]The best part, you can scale them.
[168:43.02]You can make a bunch of rats.
[168:47.84]Oh, Louis, it's the chat name.
[168:49.78]I get it.
[168:50.22]Okay.
[168:50.76]Well, thank you, Louis.
[168:51.52]This is great.
[168:55.82]It's a perfect rat model.
[168:58.24]Let's give that one a thumbs up.
[169:01.59]We also have, this is, this is Jerma Raptor.
[169:13.19]Remember this one from last night?
[169:22.44]Reverse beer belly.
[169:23.96]Yeah.
[169:27.96]I got a bigger ass than this, though.
[169:35.70]Thumbs that one up.
[169:37.62]And then I think these are the same thing.
[169:41.01]Except, I think you can actually possess this one, maybe?
[169:43.11]I think that's the same thing.
[169:47.99]It's published two different ways.
[169:52.42]Already thumbs it up.
[169:57.56]Well, that's what we had.
[169:58.42]This is what we have available.
[170:00.80]This one is like a full game, too.
[170:03.38]This is Jerma Worm.
[170:14.34]Search for Jerma985.
[170:15.28]I don't think that would matter, would it?
[170:21.22]Would that actually matter?
[170:29.28]It does not.
[170:33.97]Nothing for Jerma985.
[170:38.35]But this takes a lot to do shit in this game, so I'm...
[170:42.94]People have already made even those things that you've seen.
[170:45.48]Those things take a long time to make.
[170:53.98]Try second Jerma.
[171:00.52]jermaPop?
[171:01.12]Yeah, I'll get that out.
[171:02.60]I just kind of went to bed and woke up and started streaming again.
[171:14.74]I don't think I... There's stuff to do here.
[171:17.13]This is like the home screen.
[171:18.97]I didn't do anything here.
[171:19.93]I haven't even added anything.
[171:25.65]But who cares about this, though?
[171:28.97]Dream community jam.
[171:30.25]That's cool.
[171:30.79]Spring season.
[171:33.17]That's cool.
[171:35.61]Add the popsicle to the home screen.
[171:38.15]Wait, can I just... Can I do that?
[171:46.72]Do I have any sculptures I've made?
[171:49.30]I think I have to actually save the sculpture.
[171:53.75]Right?
[171:55.45]I don't think I've saved any of those sculptures.
[172:00.93]No, they're not saved entities.
[172:04.76]I cannot do that.
[172:07.00]That's alright.
[172:10.34]You can't add anything not made by the devs to the home screen.
[172:12.98]That comes later.
[172:13.88]Ah, I see.
[172:14.58]This is still early access, technically, so...
[172:21.23]Let's go back into Dream Shaping, or Dream Surfing.
[172:26.73]Move the tag here, because I want to do... Ah, PT.
[172:33.18]I want to see the rest of PT, right?
[172:39.08]P... T... P period T, right?
[173:02.04]Is it just PT?
[173:06.54]Vape Life was that one.
[173:08.28]I kind of want to play Vape Life.
[173:14.17]Captain Cat.
[173:17.09]That's cool.
[173:18.65]Claptrap Survival.
[173:23.76]Dreamers, the unbinding Silent Hills.
[173:26.90]There it is, right?
[173:27.88]I mean, this is it, isn't it?
[173:38.28]Maybe it's just not called PT.
[173:47.20]No, this is...
[173:53.15]Is this Silent Hill 4?
[174:02.46]What the fuck?
[174:03.66]Dude, you gotta give somebody a heart attack with this controller thing.
[174:13.41]Yeah, this is the room.
[174:14.49]Silent Hill 4.
[174:22.44]You're my favorite customer, Johnny.
[174:25.54]Thank you.
[174:26.08]Hey, doggy.
[174:26.42]I hate this radio.
[174:52.49]Well, what a story, Mark.
[174:53.27]I don't think I can do anything.
[174:55.13]Hello.
[174:55.43]I need to get out of here.
[174:59.99]Just use the key to unlock the door.
[175:02.16]I don't know how to pick up the key.
[175:24.18]Whoa, wait.
[175:26.02]I think it's... It really wants me to do this.
[175:33.92]I recently watched The Disaster Artist.
[175:37.64]And... James Franco.
[175:42.27]Honest to God.
[175:45.57]Sometimes I couldn't tell.
[175:53.94]He did such a good impression.
[175:56.22]Like, the movie itself was... The movie itself was okay.
[175:59.59]But just, like, that impression itself was worth watching.
[176:04.91]It was... Perfect.
[176:13.55]Pick up the... What?
[176:26.62]Pick up the key to open the door.
[176:28.20]I can't pick up the key.
[176:29.68]Look!
[176:31.42]There is no key pickup.
[176:36.05]Nah, that was alright.
[176:36.69]That was fun.
[176:39.83]How about human 1.0?
[176:45.77]Time corruption.
[176:46.57]Adventures of Captain Gorpu.
[176:49.75]Yo ho ho, collect some booty.
[176:51.34]Just trying to learn the tools.
[176:52.58]Yeah, I'm...
[176:55.66]Look at this.
[176:56.14]I want to see the sculptures.
[177:05.29]Do I have to press a button or something?
[177:17.08]How do I see this?
[177:17.62]I want to see your sculptures.
[177:18.46]How do I see them?
[177:21.72]Click them.
[177:22.50]I can't do anything.
[177:27.97]That's actually pretty good.
[177:31.97]Those are actually really good stones and rocks.
[177:37.10]That's a really good job.
[177:38.06]I mean, you did kind of bait me with the whole immaculate carved out statue.
[177:45.26]But these are really well done.
[177:52.64]No, this has to be here somewhere.
[178:09.15]Anything up or down?
[178:14.13]I don't think I can do anything.
[178:22.13]Oh, here we go.
[178:31.55]Rechat R1.
[178:32.59]Rechat R1.
[178:33.45]That's really good.
[178:34.27]I wonder how long this took to make.
[178:46.04]This is what I tried to do.
[178:50.48]Yeah.
[178:54.34]Mine turned into the...
[179:00.71]You know when a seven-year-old or a six-year-old draws something?
[179:05.44]And it's that really all over the place, not even remotely accurate, but they tried and it looks like they tried?
[179:14.52]This is the adult version, and mine is the six-year-old version.
[179:25.60]This is really good.
[179:27.45]This is actually very good.
[179:33.61]A functioning pottery wheel?
[179:40.28]Huh.
[179:44.28]Edit mode only.
[179:45.26]Read description.
[179:47.26]Okay.
[180:03.66]How do I do that?
[180:08.35]While in create mode, press the play button on the toolbar.
[180:13.57]Enter sculpt mode by scoping into the lump of clay.
[180:16.04]Okay, so I have to save this.
[180:23.66]Right?
[180:26.10]Can I remix it?
[180:27.00]That didn't give me an option.
[180:36.53]Continue.
[180:37.29]Reset.
[180:40.36]You can't remix stuff from the Dream Surf tab.
[180:42.58]You have to find it in the Dream Shaping browser.
[180:44.94]Oh, okay.
[180:45.42]Well, that's really cool.
[180:47.34]Captured Shanti.
[180:51.39]Eclipse.
[180:52.41]Capture the Beast Tutorial.
[180:54.09]Super loose painterly sculpts.
[181:01.55]Hard-boiled.
[181:02.11]You can look up the guy who made P.T.
[181:03.59]It's Lewis C. Alright, let's look up Lewis C. Lewis... Well, there they are.
[181:18.87]Lewis C. Creations.
[181:25.85]P.T.
[181:27.93]Work in progress.
[181:33.41]What is this?
[181:36.63]Listen up.
[181:37.81]End.
[181:38.15]Bathroom loop.
[181:39.19]Watch out.
[181:40.93]Final loop.
[181:41.65]I think we've already seen these.
[181:50.70]I'm pretty sure we've seen them all.
[181:53.54]But we can just do it.
[182:03.46]Yeah, we've seen pretty much all these screens before.
[182:16.85]Did him out of order, yeah.
[182:20.11]You can do sort by most thumbs up.
[182:28.37]Oh, we're getting started.
[182:29.59]No, no, we've already done it.
[182:32.85]Okay, haha, funny joke, where's Sam and Max?
[182:34.87]Tomorrow.
[182:36.40]Tomorrow, like, at the regular time.
[182:37.30]I feel like I've played PT, like, three times on screen at this point.
[182:38.90]Yeah, we've already done it.
[183:01.50]This game has LittleBigPlanet vibes.
[183:03.16]Well, there's a reason why you think that.
[183:04.42]It's made by the same people that made LittleBigPlanet.
[183:09.44]This is their new game.
[183:14.81]Yeah, we've already seen all these.
[183:17.27]I don't think there's any new screens.
[183:21.81]Let's go back and search for the most thumbsed up.
[183:27.34]Don't you touch the dial!
[183:31.09]Alright.
[183:32.39]Search for dreams.
[183:35.15]Categories.
[183:37.55]Is there like a most thumbed up?
[183:39.91]Sorting and filtering.
[183:41.71]Get rid of that.
[183:43.17]Most thumbs up.
[183:45.82]That FPS.
[183:46.88]This is all media molecule stuff.
[183:50.34]Curiosity.
[183:51.40]Media molecule.
[183:53.34]Hug me.
[183:55.06]Hammer pin.
[183:55.46]I think it's going to be all the things we've already seen.
[183:59.54]Am I dropping frames?
[184:00.32]That's not good.
[184:04.86]I might have to send a, uh... I might have to send another message and try to get a hold of Cox again.
[184:11.21]Because this is happening a lot more frequently now.
[184:13.29]The last two streams in a row have been just... Randomly, just thousands and thousands of frame drops for like an hour or two straight.
[184:22.96]I'm gonna probably have to send another email.
[184:26.94]You've seen this one.
[184:29.71]This one was awesome.
[184:30.51]Slayer Scrolls is great.
[184:32.77]Don't forget about Otto's appointment.
[184:33.87]No, I know.
[184:34.55]I got it.
[184:34.83]I'm good.
[184:37.47]I'll still get some time.
[184:39.00]I have enough time definitely to chill for a little bit and do the bits and hang out and talk.
[184:43.72]Probably do like one or two more.
[184:46.48]We did pool.
[184:47.24]That was cool.
[184:50.10]We've done, I think, most of the... highly rated ones.
[184:58.07]I think we've done them all, actually.
[185:04.23]Otto is a good boy.
[185:05.07]Otto is a good boy.
[185:05.97]Yeah, we've done all these.
[185:06.83]What's the most recent?
[185:10.26]Fifteen puzzle.
[185:13.10]What's this?
[185:17.82]Fifteen puzzle.
[185:19.42]Start.
[185:22.16]Shuffling in progress.
[185:23.14]Three, two, one.
[185:26.16]Block.
[185:27.50]What is block?
[185:28.26]Fourteen...
[185:37.17]I think I have to get in the right position.
[185:41.49]I guess.
[186:04.97]It's just, yeah, it's a slide puzzle where I have to go up and down.
[186:07.83]Need to get them in order.
[186:09.15]Yeah, I don't know how to do this.
[186:12.45]It's still cool, though.
[186:13.51]It is.
[186:13.77]It's interesting that somebody put this together.
[186:18.06]These blocks are all made.
[186:21.28]So that's cool.
[186:22.72]You can invert the... No, you can kill the music.
[186:30.66]That's cool.
[186:31.24]That's thumbs up worthy.
[186:33.18]It is.
[186:33.94]That's cool.
[186:36.66]Sailing at sunset.
[186:37.72]Let's look at this one.
[186:38.64]Oh, yeah.
[186:39.08]Let's see it.
[186:40.88]This looks pretty.
[186:43.91]Search for Picross.
[186:44.87]Picross.
[187:00.24]I wonder, though, how you do this.
[187:03.92]Because this is clearly darker.
[187:07.93]I don't know.
[187:08.35]I haven't even checked or really attempted.
[187:10.27]But is there a video mode?
[187:13.39]Or filming mode where you can play around with these settings?
[187:20.83]Or is it just something as simple as all lights are off and the sun is just one glowing orb?
[187:24.66]Hmm.
[187:33.44]There are world tweaks where you can change the atmosphere.
[187:37.96]There are global post-process effects in lighting.
[187:44.87]Okay.
[187:50.29]This is great.
[187:51.29]This is wonderful.
[187:54.25]Play the tutorials?
[187:55.11]I did.
[187:56.55]I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did.
[187:58.63]There's only one tutorial I didn't do.
[188:00.97]And it was the character creator.
[188:12.49]Press R1.
[188:16.19]No, don't let me ruin this!
[188:21.83]This is great!
[188:40.65]It's time for you to wake up.
[188:43.77]Get out of your dream.
[188:46.43]Flight the boat.
[188:58.30]Yeah, they gotta patch that thing out.
[189:00.88]If you're watching one of these things, if you're in, like, the play or something, hold options to my imp.
[189:09.06]You just took me out.
[189:09.80]I was in the... beach, looking over here at this boat that's sinking.
[189:17.69]And you reminded me that I was in a video game.
[189:24.21]That was really, really good.
[189:35.51]Bugs.
[189:36.94]Hi.
[189:39.70]We have to play high.
[189:45.06]Spotlight.
[189:49.87]I like the stars up here.
[190:05.63]I like the paint in the kind of the background see I should have just made something like this I spent so much time making like a bunch of mountains and lakes and I just did one thing and make an expression as an abstract art instead I spent so I did like five scenes in one scene samurai do you surrender
[190:36.49]I do not.
[190:37.69]Let's see what that does.
[190:38.53]Oh, it's just like this scene here.
[190:53.76]Okay, cool.
[190:58.01]Anything else down or over?
[191:00.65]It's just a nice little painted scene with the moon.
[191:03.57]Okay.
[191:09.92]abstract designs abducted again in progress slender find the eight pages I feel like I already did this one is that ice age
[191:41.98]Ooh, loud.
[191:43.99]This sounds like this is... That was recorded through the microphone.
[191:55.67]What you're about to see will be a fraction of what's to come pre-Alpha Footage Project Epsilon Game 2 Level 1, Level 10, and Level 21.
[192:18.42]A dream's production.
[192:26.07]This looks good.
[192:26.89]Pretty good ice sculptures.
[192:41.75]Somebody using this just to remake GameCube games.
[192:50.88]Yeah, we can't get him to run.
[192:52.54]We can't get these Wii games to run in the Dolphin emulator.
[192:58.20]Just remake the whole thing in Dreams.
[192:59.78]Do I have to do something here?
[193:19.28]This is Ice Age.
[193:34.31]So what if you record the whole Ice Age movie on your PlayStation mic and just remake the whole movie?
[193:55.15]This is the kind of thing where somebody would remake this whole movie like this to Ice Age, record it from a phone, and this would be one of the DVDs that the guy on the side of the street is selling in New York City.
[194:06.49]Like, one of the street vendors in New York is just like, I got Ice Age here.
[194:13.20]Like, oh, Ice Age, okay.
[194:29.20]Alright, this is really good, though.
[194:32.29]All jokes aside, this is very, very good.
[194:34.47]This is very well made.
[194:40.59]It is.
[194:42.57]This is literally the GameCube game.
[194:47.35]No, it isn't.
[194:49.32]That's- is this the- is this how the- is this the GameCube game?
[194:57.24]Holy shit.
[195:04.28]Look at how big this is!
[195:17.56]60 bucks for infinite game ripoff.
[195:22.30]If this game takes off, just wait till you see somebody creating.
[195:25.65]Because people will do it.
[195:29.27]People will make, like, the whole Godfather movie and shit.
[195:32.49]You know how people are.
[195:33.61]People do all kinds of, like, ridiculous shit with games like this, and engines, and... I gotta get... I can't have 23.
[195:52.48]I gotta get at least 30.
[195:55.00]Come on, I need 30.
[195:58.48]I need 30 or I won't leave.
[196:03.88]There we go, 30.
[196:04.28]Done.
[196:08.71]This snow looks really good.
[196:09.61]I don't know, how'd you do that?
[196:13.81]Is this painted?
[196:14.49]Is this painted or is this a sculpture that's been messed with?
[196:17.27]I think it's painted on.
[196:18.93]Looks really, really good, though.
[196:23.12]30 yo boomer.
[196:25.04]What's that mean?
[196:34.99]I'm gonna go back here.
[196:38.81]I know what it means.
[196:40.91]I know what it means.
[196:44.01]Press R1.
[196:52.29]It's still going.
[196:52.93]This is the best run of death scenario.
[196:57.80]Does this happen in the GameCube game?
[197:11.55]Oh my god.
[197:11.87]Crystals and... This is probably better than the GameCube game.
[197:32.76]I don't really like this.
[197:35.44]He's trying to look around.
[197:42.30]He gets punished for his sin.
[197:47.71]Ice Age 4.
[197:49.25]Going to Hell.
[198:02.36]No counter anymore, though.
[198:03.39]This is a work in progress.
[198:04.33]Alright, let me see if we're good for a time.
[198:11.39]Alright, I gotta, I gotta start to get out of here.
[198:15.47]I wanted to go for at least three hours, three, four hours before having to leave.
[198:23.79]But, like I said previously, if you weren't here at the beginning of the stream, I had the stream early and short today.
[198:30.35]So I'm going to add a day on Saturday.
[198:32.78]So we're going to go four days in a row.
[198:36.98]Tomorrow is going to be Sam & Max Season 2, probably Episode 1 and 2.
[198:40.21]We'll see where we are after that.
[198:49.94]And then, on Saturday, we're going to do an archive.org MS-DOS night.
[198:57.92]There is a website with a bunch of old, abandoned, vaporware MS-DOS games.
[199:02.06]And we're going to have some fun on Saturday night.
[199:05.79]We're going to play a bunch of them.
[199:12.67]Did I beat it?
[199:14.57]What just happened here?
[199:19.73]How did I get up here?
[199:20.61]Did I hit the last button?
[199:28.68]Holy shit, this is really well made.
[199:35.45]This is, like, REALLY well made.
[199:50.43]This is a Gork ripoff.
[199:51.41]Oh, there's no damage.
[199:53.63]That's fine, I can go.
[199:57.46]Damage has not been implemented yet.
[200:06.00]Get to the snow!
[200:06.80]I did it!
[200:23.08]I escaped the lava into the lake.
[200:28.44]This should be on the popular tab.
[200:30.50]Yeah!
[200:35.42]It really should.
[200:36.08]I mean, it is kind of just collect the nuts, but... There's a lot going on.
[200:44.64]What are we focusing on?
[201:02.94]How did they make this?
[201:03.80]I don't know, with all kinds of logic and levers and pulleys and... Am I supposed to be getting these?
[201:22.91]I love this landscape.
[201:24.59]Just take any random screenshot from this whole thing.
[201:29.94]The way the snow is on top and kind of caked over and fluffy on top, that's just wonderful.
[201:46.29]I think the camera leaf, was I supposed to be jumping on these?
[201:51.46]Does the camera leave me behind?
[201:52.92]I can hear him jumping!
[202:05.33]I missed the auto-scroller.
[202:06.65]No, but why would the camera be moving over there?
[202:11.51]No, because the camera wouldn't be turning left and right.
[202:14.73]It's putting me off the screen.
[202:25.42]We're gonna hit the waterfall, we're getting close.
[202:31.23]No, this definitely is supposed to be an auto-scroller.
[202:39.56]I can see what's going on.
[202:40.56]Can you see me?
[202:41.60]Am I down there?
[202:55.64]That was very, very good.
[202:56.78]It's a work in progress, not done.
[202:59.69]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[203:02.83]I gotta get ready and start to move on out.
[203:06.09]Rage Quit?
[203:06.65]No, that was just a regular quit.
[203:10.49]So, again, we're gonna go four days in a row this week.
[203:13.08]Tomorrow, Sam & Max Season 2, starting Episode 1 and 2.
[203:16.86]Depending on how we go in there, we might start the third episode, but we'll see.
[203:19.90]And then Saturday night...
[203:22.41]is going to be old archive MS-DOS games.
[203:31.01]So, thank you for joining me on this little, quick, quick little guy stream.
[203:37.50]I did want to go three and a half hours, and maybe, maybe like 345 at least.
[203:41.18]So, EUcrowd.com.
[203:50.45]I'm happy to at least do this once in a while.
[203:54.92]So, thank you, as always.
[203:57.38]I'll see you guys soon.
[203:58.28]If you don't catch the stream tomorrow or Saturday, then... Maybe I'll see you another time.
[204:04.41]Take care, guys.
[204:05.73]Let's move on to the bits.
[204:06.89]See you soon.
[204:11.43]Hey, look, there they are.
[204:13.51]This shouldn't take very long, because... Well, we've only been going for about three and a half hours, so...
[204:21.14]Don't do the archive.
[204:22.51]There's all sorts of weird shit in there.
[204:27.03]I'll be careful.
[204:27.83]I'll be careful.
[204:28.67]I'll be careful.
[204:32.65]We're gonna do click.
[204:34.23]Smart click.
[204:35.85]For you to pick the game I'm gonna play.
[204:38.23]And I'm gonna... Now that I know that, I'm gonna make sure that whatever you do, we're gonna click on them and we're gonna check them before we do them.
[204:48.72]But, a few hours ago we had...
[204:52.37]Let's see here... Tora T gave five community subs earlier this morning.
[204:57.23]Thank you, Tora T. Didn't catch you when you did it, but thank you, regardless.
[205:03.55]CQ, thanks for the ten bucks.
[205:05.10]They say WTF.
[205:08.34]I'm not sure why, but thank you for the ten dollars.
[205:11.26]They said, oh, it's because of the time it was.
[205:13.62]I see, I see.
[205:16.09]Thank you, CQ.
[205:17.77]CQ for the $10.
[205:18.35]And yes, I started at like 11.30 a.m.
[205:22.03]today.
[205:24.31]C4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[205:25.75]Ironforge Parkour Stream, when?
[205:28.16]Maybe if Wild Classic comes out and that doesn't... They didn't fix that.
[205:31.10]Maybe it's Classic, so it's there and it's not patched.
[205:34.08]I will show you.
[205:35.86]If it is a thing I can do.
[205:39.34]But thank you for the $2.50.
[205:41.19]Atrolux, Atrix, thanks for the 250.
[205:42.71]Shoutouts to SimpleFlips.
[205:45.89]SimpleFlips, is that a game in Dreams?
[205:50.51]Thank you for the 250.
[205:56.76]TheJack, thanks for the 250.
[205:57.96]Don't give shoutouts to It's A Trap.
[206:04.64]Oh.
[206:07.26]Probably should have read that second one first.
[206:12.24]I don't know what it's a trap of.
[206:15.02]I don't know what that means.
[206:20.56]Did I just say something wrong?
[206:22.02]I don't know.
[206:27.87]Don't tell him.
[206:28.93]Whatever.
[206:30.51]I don't know any of these things.
[206:32.29]I thought that was a game in dreams.
[206:37.07]Anyways, thanks for the $2.50.
[206:40.97]Thank you Ned for the three dollars.
[206:42.25]If you like dream sculpting, you should try a VR sculpting program like Sculptor VR.
[206:46.13]They are quite fun.
[206:49.53]I think the next time I do dreams sculpting will be with the move controllers.
[206:53.19]I feel like it's way better.
[206:56.53]Because you actually can move your hand around.
[207:00.20]It's not tilting around a controller with your wrists.
[207:02.50]I feel like if I had two hands, being able to hold things and sculpt around it, I'd probably do a lot better.
[207:10.45]It feels so good with them.
[207:11.53]Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[207:17.59]But yeah, Sculptor VR.
[207:18.45]Maybe I'll try it.
[207:19.70]There's a few more VR games that have come out to add to the list, so... Why not, right?
[207:27.92]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $2.50.
[207:30.22]Can't stick around for tonight's stream, but wanted to show a little support.
[207:32.97]Hope you have fun.
[207:34.61]Thank you for the $2.50, but we have... Tonight...
[207:38.07]I wonder where are you?
[207:39.57]I mean, you're not here now, but... Tonight.
[207:43.87]If it's like 11 or 12 o'clock, 11.30 in the morning, where would be nighttime?
[207:51.23]Somewhere in Asia?
[207:56.83]Okay.
[207:57.89]Tonight, yeah.
[208:01.01]Australia or Asia?
[208:05.34]It's always interesting to see where people are coming from, you know?
[208:10.84]Hey, Marvash Magali, thanks for the 250.
[208:12.78]The song you wanted, there it is.
[208:14.24]This is the video that made it famous.
[208:18.18]Video that made it famous.
[208:26.91]You got that.
[208:32.69]Oh, so you got, okay.
[208:38.64]This video has 25 million views?
[208:40.71]What the fuck?
[208:51.27]Well, that's a thing.
[208:55.37]Cool.
[208:58.57]I didn't even know what it was.
[209:01.95]Show it.
[209:03.45]No, I don't got time.
[209:04.37]I don't got time.
[209:04.81]I don't got time.
[209:06.28]Everybody knows this meme except for me.
[209:08.94]Except for you.
[209:09.94]You're talking to the ultimate in meme history that I don't know.
[209:18.73]I don't know any meme history.
[209:26.11]We're both out of touch.
[209:27.99]No, we're not.
[209:30.03]You're not out of touch.
[209:33.67]That's not what it is.
[209:36.61]Out of touch would mean that I've never heard this before and I don't like it.
[209:42.34]I think this is stupid.
[209:45.34]No, I'm just... That doesn't... Out of touch means I have a problem with it.
[209:52.09]Out of time.
[209:52.83]Yeah, mossy.
[209:53.71]Out of time is more accurate.
[209:58.01]He can't accept that he's out of touch.
[209:59.35]You know, I probably am.
[210:00.31]I turned 34 this year.
[210:03.00]Who knows what the hell you kids are fucking listening to these days.
[210:06.22]I don't know.
[210:09.42]I've listened to the Ren and Stimpy soundtrack and I watched Rugrats on TV.
[210:13.70]That's all I did.
[210:14.84]I don't have any other references.
[210:17.63]Every reference you've ever heard me make was tied to a Ren and Stimpy episode.
[210:22.05]I don't have anything else up here.
[210:29.40]What a man-child.
[210:30.58]What?
[210:31.37]I'm... Hey.
[210:40.09]Boomers gotta do what a boomer's gotta do.
[210:44.92]So, okay, if I'm a boomer at 34, what am I at 55?
[210:46.96]Am I still a boomer?
[210:52.75]I'm not even 34 yet, I just always- I- do you guys do the same thing?
[210:55.19]I do this- Do you guys say how old you are for the year that it currently is?
[211:00.83]Because you don't want to- Because you know it's coming?
[211:08.13]Like, I'm 33, but like, I'm turning 34, and it's like, fuck, that's the- I just say I'm 34.
[211:15.12]Because it's- it's coming, it's gonna happen.
[211:19.24]January 1st, 2019, I was 34.
[211:22.42]January 1st, 2020, I'm gonna be 35.
[211:24.55]I just... I've never heard anyone say that.
[211:34.80]It's a way to cope with how old you're getting.
[211:38.27]It's like, how old are you?
[211:40.89]I'm 34.
[211:41.13]I turned 34 this year.
[211:42.35]I'm 34.
[211:43.37]But in my mind, in my own, you know, headcanon, I'm 33.
[211:47.18]I know that, so it's like, ah, you know, I'm just preparing for it.
[211:53.76]Uh, thank you C2K for the bets.
[211:58.33]Yeah, it's a federal crime to lie about your age.
[212:04.90]You're hitting yourself.
[212:05.72]You're hurting yourself twice.
[212:07.12]No, I'm not.
[212:07.60]I'm preparing.
[212:11.28]I had a nightmare last night from your worm creation.
[212:17.63]Sorry.
[212:19.15]CluelessSniper, thanks for the 250.
[212:22.15]No message, thank you though.
[212:23.95]And then finally we have Zach or Zakey.
[212:27.19]Zach, how do you say your name?
[212:29.13]You've popped up a few times.
[212:30.09]I want to make sure I get it right.
[212:30.97]Is it Zachy?
[212:31.81]Is it Zake?
[212:32.93]Zachy?
[212:33.47]Zachay?
[212:34.55]Zachay?
[212:39.43]Jeremy really enjoyed the stream, but you really didn't have to scream.
[212:48.17]Thanks for the $2.50.
[212:48.61]Appreciate it.
[212:55.04]January 2nd birthday.
[212:56.28]Don't... Got no trouble like you, Boomer.
[213:02.24]Yeah, I mean, if you had a January 1st, January 2nd birthday, that's actually really convenient.
[213:07.27]Because you are just... The next year, you are the next year older.
[213:11.31]Imagine having a January 2nd birthday, January 1st birthday.
[213:18.79]Hey, Atrolux, Atrox, thanks for the 250.
[213:20.46]Shoutouts to the thing that people said I got told to say.
[213:23.52]And thanks for the 250.
[213:25.24]What do you say we run the credits?
[213:30.14]Here they come.
[213:34.05]The subs on this stream today are as follows.
[213:39.17]That guy.
[213:40.51]This one.
[213:41.67]That one.
[213:43.49]This one.
[213:43.99]That one.
[213:46.75]I'm going to say one person's name here.
[213:48.79]Everyone's going to be so jealous.
[213:51.62]You ready?
[213:56.22]Which one am I going to say?
[213:58.30]Who's the lucky one?
[214:01.58]Ooh, I was going to say it.
[214:02.96]I was going to say, ooh, nope.
[214:09.11]Okay, it's going to be the one, five names from right now.
[214:13.23]One, two, three, four.
[214:20.63]St.
[214:22.65]Serge Hunter.
[214:25.39]And then Sticks.
[214:28.25]There you go.
[214:32.07]He can't say it right.
[214:34.83]Too bad it didn't land on Jerma's nuts, right?
[214:38.01]Alright, the next one I'm gonna say is ten from now.
[214:42.35]Ready?
[214:43.39]One.
[214:44.37]Two.
[214:46.39]Mm.
[214:47.25]Mm.
[214:48.51]Mm.
[214:49.97]Mm.
[214:51.42]Mm.
[214:54.02]Eight.
[214:55.26]Nine.
[214:56.88]Mr. Spoop.
[214:57.76]Hey, thanks a lot.
[214:58.48]Appreciate it.
[215:05.24]I'm surprised there's this many subs for a stream that's less than a few, you know, three or four hours.
[215:11.14]Thank you guys, for real.
[215:14.27]I will see you real soon.
[215:15.01]We're gonna be the normal time probably, maybe, I don't know.
[215:22.59]It depends on when I go to sleep tonight.
[215:27.46]Plan on the normal time, but you may... Maybe.
[215:31.90]Maybe.
[215:32.92]You might see me like a couple hours early.
[215:35.52]Maybe.
[215:36.92]Depending on if I... Just plan... Look, it'll be a nice surprise for you.
[215:42.37]It's gonna start between 3 and 4.
[215:43.93]Pacific.
[215:44.67]But like, you know, maybe.
[215:46.93]It might be an hour too early.
[215:47.99]I don't know.
[215:48.71]We'll see.
[215:50.33]What are these names?
[215:53.46]Forgot password to my account.
[216:00.20]I push all the buttons.
[216:04.67]There are a lot of strange names, huh?
[216:16.28]I just got her.
[216:16.82]I thought Jerma sleeps during the day like a normal streamer.
[216:33.01]Am I going to rebuttal that?
[216:34.61]I can't... What am I going to say against that?
[216:42.80]But, thank you for joining me on the short stream.
[216:45.12]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sam & Max Season 2, Episode 1.
[216:50.23]And then Saturday for the MS-DOS Extravaganza.
[216:55.64]Take care.
[216:56.76]Have a great night.
[216:58.04]Great day?
[216:58.68]No, it's not even night.
[216:59.56]This is weird.
[217:00.28]I usually start streaming like now.
[217:02.16]It's weird.
[217:05.58]Have a great rest of your afternoon.
[217:08.19]And evening for some of you.
[217:10.93]See you tomorrow.
[217:12.45]Ta-ta.
[217:13.23]Goodbye.
