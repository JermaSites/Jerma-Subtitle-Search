[00:08.46]Don't call this number again.
[00:09.50]Yes, this is the safety man speaking.
[00:11.74]And I want you to know that I'm gonna protect planet Earth and... If you call this number again, I'm gonna call the police, okay?
[00:19.55]Don't fucking call again.
[00:20.99]No, didn't you call me?
[00:22.57]No!
[00:23.95]Oh, sorry.
[00:27.35]I'm getting really bored of this car.
[00:30.37]I think I want a new car.
[00:32.81]Yeah, I do.
[00:34.26]Wait.
[00:35.67]Wow.
[00:36.15]A good thing I wore my safety helmet so I stay fine.
[00:44.82]My new safety mobile is equipped.
[00:47.36]But I'll get... That's jaywalking.
[00:49.44]You're in trouble.
[00:51.02]You're in trouble for jaywalking.
[00:55.68]This is not safe for you to be over here.
[00:58.44]Whoops.
[00:59.30]Sorry.
[00:59.82]This safety mobile is a little too fast.
[01:03.71]I think the safety mobile sometimes goes out of control.
[01:07.95]And I said I don't know how to control it.
[01:10.85]Just be careful or you'll get in my way.
[01:19.52]Just make sure you wear your airbag for safety.
[01:23.04]Okay, bye.
[01:26.73]Got an argument going on over here?
[01:28.77]This guy's like... He's like... Desperately... Cut it out.
[01:34.57]You psycho.
[01:36.11]I'll try to punch him, let's see.
[01:40.88]What is happening?
[01:43.26]This is just... This is too... Oh shit, he's got a gun.
[01:50.68]He's got a gun.
[01:51.18]No!
[01:51.48]Take it out!
[01:52.02]Gun!
[01:52.72]Take it out!
[01:53.58]Just...
[01:56.34]So here's an important water safety tip, sir.
[01:59.46]Never go swimming 30 minutes before eating a pizza.
[02:03.76]I think that's what it is.
[02:04.82]Maybe it's salami.
[02:06.24]I don't remember.
[02:07.36]Ow.
[02:08.16]Hey.
[02:08.38]There.
[02:10.26]Ow, my face.
[02:11.64]Sir, never go swimming after ordering a pizza.
[02:14.85]Did I say that already?
[02:17.31]Yeah, safety's stupid.
[02:18.37]No, it's not.
[02:18.75]Safety's a dumb thing.
[02:19.27]Fuck you.
[02:19.51]What are you going to do about it?
[02:20.53]Safety's good.
[02:20.87]What are you going to do about it?
[02:21.97]Safety sucks.
[02:22.57]Fuck you.
[02:22.96]You want to go?
[02:23.30]Yeah, what are you going to do?
[02:24.08]Safety's good.
[02:24.60]You little bitch.
[02:25.28]Safety's good.
[02:25.90]You don't like safety.
[02:26.64]Safety's for pussies like you.
[02:27.54]Yeah, it is.
[02:28.12]No, no, it's not.
[02:29.04]Take the first punch.
[02:29.72]You punch me.
[02:30.12]Take the first punch.
[02:30.74]You hit me.
[02:31.04]Take the first punch.
[02:31.98]You punch me.
[02:32.90]You swing.
[02:33.17]No, you swing.
[02:33.67]No, you swing.
[02:34.19]You swing first.
[02:34.83]You swing.
[02:35.25]I ain't going to swing.
[02:36.33]You swing.
[02:36.71]You little pussy.
[02:37.75]You little bitch.
[02:38.19]You don't know me, Dad.
[02:38.95]Safety.
[02:39.59]Dumbass.
[02:40.17]Safety's good.
[02:42.51]Excuse me, excuse me, that fire's not safe.
[02:46.26]You need to get away from that fire.
[02:48.64]I'll rescue you from the fire.
[02:50.34]What the hell?
[02:57.22]Can I, is that your money?
[02:59.26]Thank you.
[03:01.99]A bike lying in the street like this is a safety hazard.
[03:05.77]I should return it to the owner immediately.
[03:11.62]You want to try to punch me?
[03:12.64]You want to hit me?
[03:13.46]Oh, you're terrible.
[03:14.34]Safety wins overall, always.
