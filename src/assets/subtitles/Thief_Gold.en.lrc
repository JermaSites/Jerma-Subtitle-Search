[00:05.12]How you doing?
[00:07.38]What's happening?
[00:09.26]I cleared my throat right before talking too, and that's the worst.
[00:11.72]You know when you think you're just ready to talk?
[00:14.53]This happens sometimes when I answer a phone call too.
[00:20.19]Milk voice?
[00:20.87]Did you say milk voice?
[00:22.55]What the hell?
[00:23.19]That's weird.
[00:25.29]I know exactly what that means.
[00:26.64]I don't even like drink milk anymore.
[00:28.60]I don't even like milk.
[00:30.40]That is weird.
[00:31.12]Alright, anyways.
[00:33.81]Right before you answer a phone call, you go.
[00:37.21]Hello.
[00:38.67]And then you answer and say that.
[00:53.70]You get, like, prepared.
[00:54.90]And then you answer the phone call.
[00:56.58]But after that, it sucks when you do all that.
[00:59.54]So your phone starts ringing.
[01:01.63]And you go, You can do this, you can do this, you can do this, you can do this!
[01:09.59]I hate it.
[01:10.05]It's the worst.
[01:17.58]Next game, what?
[01:28.91]I'm just fucking around.
[01:30.17]Why does everybody take everything I say so seriously?
[01:32.09]You know what I mean?
[01:33.79]Why are you so serious, Batman?
[01:36.90]I'm fucked up today.
[01:37.80]I'm in a really weird mood.
[01:39.00]And I think the reason why I'm in such a weird mood today is because... There's a whole hand's worth of olives sitting next to me and I'm gonna put them on my fingers, I guess.
[01:53.81]As I was buying the olives...
[01:56.45]And as I was walking around, and as I was getting prepared for the stream, every five to six minutes, I'd say, who am I doing this for?
[02:09.26]It's not for me.
[02:09.92]Because I don't care, right?
[02:12.58]I, like, don't care about putting olives on my fingers.
[02:17.17]It's one person said this.
[02:21.86]One person.
[02:23.10]Why do I do this?
[02:24.62]I don't even... Why do I do this?
[02:29.30]I don't care either.
[02:30.02]I don't know why... Yeah, exactly.
[02:31.49]Does anybody here actually want to see this?
[02:34.07]I don't think anybody cares.
[02:39.39]But we're doing it anyways.
[02:47.47]And I'm not going to do it until there's at least 10,000 people here.
[02:51.34]I know.
[02:51.84]I'm like, what a psycho.
[02:54.10]An egomaniac.
[02:56.52]No, I'm not gonna eat olives off my fingers unless there's 10,000 people here watching.
[03:02.65]Oy.
[03:08.03]Anyways, today, you probably saw the title.
[03:12.09]I'm going to play Thief Gold.
[03:13.45]I'll give you a short story here.
[03:17.67]Thief Gold has been installed.
[03:18.95]Well, not installed.
[03:19.57]It's been purchased and in my You Should Stream This list for probably three or four years since I was back in Massachusetts.
[03:33.58]I just kind of looked at it today.
[03:34.54]I was like, fine, I'll put it on the poll.
[03:36.62]Why not?
[03:39.18]And it won.
[03:44.26]So, this is the GOG version, yes.
[03:46.79]This is not the Steam version.
[03:51.59]Somebody said, do you collect trinkets around your house pretending to be a goblin, laughing as you throw them into a sack?
[03:57.79]Why would I do that in my own house?
[04:00.53]No, in your house is where you start counting the things you took.
[04:05.26]I took the goblet.
[04:06.64]I took the treasure chest.
[04:08.10]I took the gold coins.
[04:09.20]I don't put them back in the sack.
[04:10.46]I count them.
[04:13.88]Why would I do that?
[04:14.33]I've already put them in the sack.
[04:21.05]I took the urinal.
[04:26.11]I took the urinal.
[04:27.09]Yeah.
[04:31.19]What a shitty... That sucks.
[04:34.70]What am I going to do with that?
[04:35.54]What would I do with that?
[04:36.32]That's just stupid.
[04:45.85]You converted it into a fan.
[04:51.75]That thing's nice.
[04:52.51]In fact, thanks for reminding me.
[04:53.53]I'm going to turn it on now.
[04:55.41]I'm turning my rotating urinal on because I want some air.
[05:03.83]It's actually pretty cool.
[05:05.05]It's got a filter in it.
[05:06.01]You know that?
[05:08.53]This has got an air filter baked in the middle and inside of it.
[05:13.57]And it sucks air in through the filter and then blows it off the top.
[05:16.65]It's actually pretty cool.
[05:19.45]And there's no fan on it.
[05:20.89]It's a fanless fan.
[05:23.95]Eat an olive on stream.
[05:25.19]I'm just, hold on.
[05:26.33]I just turned it on.
[05:31.80]Alright, so we're talking you want like the... Hold on, I gotta... I gotta go on cam for this.
[05:38.82]So you want... What you want... Is you want... You're talking about like I get it on my hand and I go like... Right?
[05:47.99]That's what you want?
[05:49.49]Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right?
[05:51.19]That's what you're looking for.
[05:51.99]I think that's what you want.
[05:57.53]Can I even get these on?
[05:58.59]It's gonna be hard.
[06:05.56]We're moving on real quick from this too, by the way.
[06:10.02]This is like, I'm not spending more than a minute on this.
[06:12.64]I can't, how am I supposed to do it on both hands?
[06:16.39]I just broke one.
[06:17.01]I fucking hit the goddamn ground and it's your fault.
[06:22.25]You did this to me.
[06:24.13]Alright, look!
[06:24.75]Ooh, my fingers!
[06:30.18]I... It hit the ground.
[06:32.26]I can't... These ones have, like, pimento in them.
[06:35.76]I can't put these on my finger?
[06:37.16]I mean, I can.
[06:43.12]Woo-hoo-hoo!
[06:49.40]I don't care.
[06:49.84]Does it want to hit the ground?
[06:55.90]I got the wrong olives?
[06:56.86]I don't know anything about olives.
[06:57.68]What do you think I know anything about olives?
[06:59.22]Why would I know anything about olives?
[07:00.66]Why would I know anything about olives?
[07:06.00]Why would I know anything about olives?
[07:08.65]Hey, dude, you got the wrong olives.
[07:09.79]Oh, yeah.
[07:10.33]Oh, sorry.
[07:11.27]There's like fucking 40 cases at the grocery store.
[07:17.99]I can't get them on all my fingers.
[07:19.54]You can just Photoshop it.
[07:20.50]Here, look.
[07:24.09]I got the wrong olives.
[07:26.19]Here you go.
[07:26.53]Ready?
[07:27.49]Like... Oh, that looks gross.
[07:35.59]Okay.
[07:39.02]What is pimento?
[07:44.00]Your hands too big or they too small?
[07:45.30]I don't know.
[07:45.62]They're just olives.
[07:46.20]I just got like olives.
[07:47.30]I didn't know.
[07:49.39]There's black olives.
[07:50.25]There's green olives.
[07:51.55]Black olives are like cut into rings sometimes.
[07:53.59]Is that what you meant?
[07:54.93]I just bought olives at the grocery store.
[07:57.07]I don't know.
[08:04.94]I got one.
[08:06.86]I got two on my fingers.
[08:09.64]What the fuck is he doing?
[08:10.66]I don't... You know, and that's exactly why we're done.
[08:12.86]I just used one of my dog wipes.
[08:17.47]These are actually dog wipes.
[08:19.17]I'm not kidding.
[08:19.93]These are dog grooming wipes.
[08:23.77]Like, wipe on his paws.
[08:30.45]No deal?
[08:30.97]I didn't even make a deal.
[08:32.03]I don't even care if I don't have... What do you mean, deal?
[08:33.68]I don't care.
[08:34.14]I was just like, I'm gonna try to put him on.
[08:35.86]You got scammed?
[08:40.76]There was no scam.
[08:41.44]There's no deal.
[08:42.34]Somebody said, put olives on your fingers and go like, hoo-hoo-hoo at the screen.
[08:45.10]And I was like, okay, I guess.
[08:46.48]I'll do it.
[08:46.92]Why?
[08:47.14]Why?
[08:49.74]Put an olive up in each nostril.
[08:57.06]No.
[08:58.24]No, because that's fucking weird.
[08:59.48]That's like, I don't know.
[09:02.60]No, not happening.
[09:04.70]I don't even like olives.
[09:05.90]I like olive oil, but olives are a little too acidic.
[09:12.13]You considered it?
[09:12.73]I did, because it's stupid.
[09:14.37]But that's childish, right?
[09:16.81]It's childish.
[09:21.38]It's childish.
[09:22.10]It's what it is.
[09:22.68]It's like, oh, look at this.
[09:25.80]I got olives in my nose.
[09:27.56]Clowns don't even do that at children's birthday parties.
[09:32.27]No one should ever do that.
[09:33.35]No one should ever do something like that.
[09:37.35]Sneeze out the olives?
[09:38.59]Yeah, that's just weird.
[09:39.91]Why would anybody do that?
[09:46.04]Anyways, we're gonna play... There you go.
[09:47.88]For the one person that said, put olives on your fingers and eat them.
[09:50.18]I don't know what that was for.
[09:55.03]But, yeah, I got the wrong olives.
[09:59.85]A-scam?
[10:01.43]I mean, maybe I'll put it on for a little bit.
[10:02.81]But I gotta move it, though.
[10:03.71]It's in the wrong spot.
[10:05.45]Actually, well, who cares?
[10:07.01]Doesn't matter.
[10:07.41]I guess I can crop it.
[10:10.65]But we're gonna play Thief.
[10:14.04]Crop this.
[10:18.04]here it looks alright I don't you know what I don't like forward facing facecam I feel like I'm in like an interview with you right or I feel like you're inside the monitor and it's weird I like an angle because it's like you're you're like over here you're not just like literally staring in my eyes like here I don't know I don't like forward facing webcam
[10:44.64]Alright, well, whatever.
[10:45.44]We're going to move this out of the way.
[10:47.64]Let me just move the camera.
[10:50.77]In case I want to use it for any reason.
[10:55.99]We're going to play Thief.
[10:59.23]Thief Gold.
[10:59.93]It's the GOG version.
[11:00.95]I don't know anything about this game.
[11:02.01]I know nothing at all.
[11:06.01]Move the pair of underwear that's on the ground over here so you don't see it.
[11:13.56]I don't want you to see the underwear that I have on the ground.
[11:19.70]Don't worry about it.
[11:21.72]Close my door.
[11:22.76]Alright.
[11:23.89]Alright, let's go.
[11:29.49]Why is there underwear in your office?
[11:30.73]I don't know.
[11:33.73]Because I was probably doing laundry or something.
[11:36.93]Is it in a good spot?
[11:38.68]Tell me.
[11:43.14]Not really.
[11:46.63]Oh, shit, I have a ring light.
[11:47.75]I can turn... No, it hurts my eyes.
[11:48.97]I don't want to use it.
[11:53.53]Alright, we got... Pretty much everybody's here.
[11:54.80]We can get going.
[11:55.90]Thief gold.
[11:57.60]Make sure I'm comfortable.
[11:58.46]I need to... No, you know what?
[11:59.50]I gotta get... These olives are gonna smell and it's gonna make me fucking gag.
[12:05.22]Perfect.
[12:08.56]Put the ring light around your neck.
[12:12.81]If I put the ring light around my neck, I...
[12:16.61]It could actually fit.
[12:18.83]It would be fucking stupid.
[12:22.87]Oh, don't.
[12:23.65]Don't stall this stream any more than it has to be.
[12:26.32]Please.
[12:27.44]Let me just play Thief.
[12:29.86]That's so stupid.
[12:30.88]I think my... No, what if I get stuck?
[12:33.72]What if I get stuck and I have to go get it removed?
[12:39.53]What if I get stuck?
[12:40.33]No, I might get stuck.
[12:41.35]I think I could get it in there, but what if I can't get it out?
[12:44.29]If I get stuck... I'm 36.
[12:47.03]Okay?
[12:48.23]I can't make those mistakes anymore.
[12:51.35]I can't put my head in a ring light and blame it on, like, like, oh, man, you know, I was in college and, you know, we were drinking Bud Lights.
[13:01.01]And I was like, yeah, you know, give me the ring light.
[13:03.35]I'm 36.
[13:03.77]I'm an older man now.
[13:05.05]I can't do that.
[13:07.03]I can't go to, like, the emergency room and, like, blame it on, like, the fucking Bud Reds we were all drinking.
[13:12.61]Like, having fun just hanging out and, like, put it around.
[13:14.93]No.
[13:16.18]Nope.
[13:18.82]No.
[13:19.08]No, that's dangerous.
[13:21.22]Just tell the nurse that you're famous.
[13:22.94]What?
[13:23.10]Who cares?
[13:26.52]Oh, yeah.
[13:26.94]See, I'm famous.
[13:27.54]That's why I put a ring light around my head and got stuck.
[13:33.16]What does that have to do with anything?
[13:34.96]Like, the idiocy is still just the same as if I had one viewer or 10,000.
[13:37.86]Alright, let's go.
[13:47.34]I'm imagining the drunk guy that just comes in.
[13:50.22]Yeah, sorry.
[13:51.56]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[13:52.48]I'm famous, by the way.
[13:54.94]Famous where?
[13:56.46]In my college dorm room.
[13:59.52]It's the same.
[14:00.58]It's the same exact argument.
[14:03.58]Yeah, they call me fucking crazy, Bill.
[14:07.66]Pretty famous.
[14:11.76]No, I'm not doing it.
[14:13.28]Maybe I'll see if I can put my head in there.
[14:15.32]Not today, though.
[14:17.94]On the next stream, if it's safe, I'll do it.
[14:21.34]Alright.
[14:21.88]Turn this shit off.
[14:25.13]Alright.
[14:25.53]We're going to play Thief.
[14:26.25]Are you ready?
[14:27.49]Oh, I'm famous.
[14:35.99]Well, then you should probably know better.
[14:40.09]Like what you... Hold on.
[14:40.85]You're telling me that you showed an audience of like 15,000 people...
[14:45.33]Hahaha, look how funny it is.
[14:46.57]I just got my head stuck in a light.
[14:48.89]You should be way more responsible.
[14:50.43]What are you talking about?
[14:51.23]Alright, we're gonna play Thief.
[14:56.01]I'll do facecam eventually, maybe in like 10 minutes.
[15:02.75]How hard is this game?
[15:03.47]Is this game hard?
[15:05.09]Tell me the truth.
[15:07.31]Tell me the truth.
[15:08.89]Is this a hard game?
[15:14.05]If chat is good, I'll turn the facecam on.
[15:16.97]Only if you're good, though.
[15:18.73]And you better prove it.
[15:20.66]Start training.
[15:21.42]Normal, hard.
[15:22.12]Not playing this on expert.
[15:23.10]I'm not playing it on hard either.
[15:25.12]Not happening.
[15:26.18]My arms are too high.
[15:28.16]What's going on here?
[15:32.72]Okay.
[15:32.92]I need to be... There we go.
[15:35.38]I gotta be higher than here.
[15:36.26]There it is.
[15:36.58]Okay.
[15:38.72]Alright.
[15:39.18]Start training.
[15:39.70]I don't know how to play.
[15:42.83]I'm playing on normal, I'm not playing on hard.
[15:48.43]It's a boomer stealth game?
[15:49.65]Oh god.
[15:53.21]The essence of balance is detachment.
[15:56.44]To embrace a cause, to grow fond or spiteful is to lose one's balance.
[16:05.02]After which, no action can be trusted.
[16:10.77]The burden is not for the dependent of spirit.
[16:16.31]I am Maiar, the Third Keeper.
[16:19.87]I was a kid.
[16:21.29]No parents, no home.
[16:23.35]Running messages and picking pockets to keep my ribs from meeting my spine.
[16:28.09]One night I saw a man.
[16:29.74]Folks just passed him by like he wasn't there.
[16:32.56]I thought he must have something valuable, so I snuck up on him and made a grab.
[16:40.72]That's not for you.
[16:42.48]Please, sir, I'm hungry.
[16:43.94]Don't tell the Hammers, I promise.
[16:45.46]What is your name, boy?
[16:47.98]Garrett.
[16:48.78]You have talent, lad.
[16:50.61]Let go of me, old man!
[16:52.57]To see a keeper is not an easy thing.
[16:55.47]Especially one who does not wish to be seen.
[16:59.04]We have a need for those as gifted as yourself.
[17:02.37]If you've grown tired of how you live, then follow me and we will show you a different way.
[17:07.45]It's worth paying for a young actor to do this.
[17:11.14]I caught up with him just before he vanished into the crowd.
[17:14.14]It was the beginning of a very long education.
[17:17.39]This is always the problem I have with audiobooks, too.
[17:19.71]I, like, I don't... Reading, I don't... Reading is fine, right?
[17:22.75]You can kind of make up your own voices and stuff.
[17:24.91]But anytime you listen to an audiobook, and the... It's usually just one person who reads the whole book, and they'll typically do voices for everybody, and it's usually, like, if they get to, like, a young character, or a higher character with a much higher-pitched voice that they think.
[17:43.32]They kind of just all... And when they have a conversation with themselves, it's always funny.
[17:46.38]It's like...
[17:47.42]I didn't want to do that.
[17:49.08]I didn't want to go there.
[17:51.02]Well, you had to at school.
[17:53.43]Is it very important?
[17:54.85]As she said, leaning down.
[17:56.83]It always kind of feels off somehow.
[17:59.59]But that can almost add to the charm in a way.
[18:06.12]I like to make up my own voices in my head when they do it.
[18:08.34]That's literally you.
[18:09.14]That's what I'm saying.
[18:10.96]Alright, normal.
[18:11.68]Follow the directions of your instructor in order to pass the training tests.
[18:15.76]This is your last chance to make it not normie.
[18:21.50]Welcome, young Garrett.
[18:23.20]In the nearby rooms, I will instruct you in the various skills you will need to survive.
[18:27.77]Please stay in the entrance area to each room while I explain the room's purpose.
[18:32.01]When you are ready to begin your lessons, proceed down this hallway to the first room.
[18:37.79]Who's walking?
[18:39.31]What if I'm not ready?
[18:43.04]Are those health?
[18:44.70]Why do I have like little health icons?

[19:07.58]Holding S walks me forward.
[19:10.90]It's tank controls?
[19:12.04]No, it's not.
[19:15.42]I need to rebind the keys.
[19:21.99]Forward, W, walk forward.

[21:13.87]Blackjack arrow.
[21:15.05]Water arrow.
[21:15.75]Fire.
[21:16.01]What is all this magical shit?
[21:17.35]I thought I was a stealer.
[21:19.71]Rope Healing Potion, F1.
[21:22.69]Breath Potion, F2.
[21:24.29]What is this?
[21:24.81]Is this Listerine?
[21:25.63]What are you talking about?
[21:26.75]Breath Potion?
[21:28.54]Holy Water, F3.
[21:29.86]Some of... You guys are just helping out.
[21:31.08]Whatever.
[21:32.06]Square Toothed Lockpick.
[21:34.88]Triangle Toothed Lockpick.
[21:36.42]Flash Bomb.
[21:37.18]Gas Mine.
[21:38.75]Compass.

[21:48.35]Block.
[21:48.83]Keyboard.
[21:49.77]Insert?
[21:51.61]Gamma.
[21:52.43]Gamma rays.
[21:53.79]Gamma plus.
[21:55.25]Lean forward.
[21:56.59]W. Alt.
[21:57.07]Shift.
[21:57.43]Quick save.
[21:58.07]Alright, we know what quick save is.
[22:00.33]Take a screenshot.
[22:01.68]Increase main volume.
[22:02.96]Decrease volume.
[22:06.10]I'm just gonna play.
[22:14.88]Okay, at least like the basic controls are fine.
[22:22.53]You must learn how to move unseen.
[22:24.95]Okay.
[22:25.11]Stay in the shadows.
[22:26.35]Oh, just see?
[22:27.31]The indicator on your screen will tell you how visible you are.
[22:30.54]Try to reach the top of the platform without being seen.
[22:33.52]Okay.
[22:34.36]Top of the platform?
[22:35.14]Where's the top of the platform?
[22:36.16]So just don't be seen by these guys.
[22:38.32]He's literally facing the other way.
[22:39.57]What?
[22:39.95]His head is facing the door.
[22:41.21]He's not even looking this way.
[22:42.43]He's looking at the door.
[22:51.53]He's literally facing the other direction.
[22:55.98]But just because I'm in the shade, he can't see me?
[22:58.24]Oh, he's not.
[23:02.51]He's looking this way.
[23:03.25]Alright, so get to the top of the platform.
[23:04.89]So, I gotta get behind him.
[23:09.20]Well done.
[23:10.46]I did not see you approach.
[23:12.41]Open this door to continue.
[23:13.97]What?
[23:14.17]When the door is near the center of your screen, it will light up, indicating that it is selected.
[23:19.41]Okay.
[23:19.77]To manipulate selected doors and other objects, use them.
[23:25.33]Oh, that's bad.
[23:26.03]Mouse 3 to use?
[23:27.29]What a dumb idea.
[23:28.17]Proceed down this corridor for your next test.
[23:31.25]How do you sprint?
[23:32.05]You can check your map at any time.
[23:34.37]Does it show where- Oh, no, please.
[23:36.59]No, no, no, no, no.
[23:38.52]It doesn't give you like a you are here in the mall.
[23:41.28]Oh, this is bad.
[23:42.12]I guess I'm right here.
[23:47.24]Now you must learn to move quietly.
[23:49.51]Some surfaces are louder than others when walked upon.
[23:52.03]And moving quickly makes more noise than moving slowly.
[23:54.51]Okay, don't walk on like the glass.
[23:55.61]Listen to your own footsteps to hear how much noise you are making.
[23:59.27]The instructor will have his back turned.
[24:01.11]You must get to the top of the platform without being heard.
[24:04.58]Isn't he the instructor?
[24:07.52]Alright, so just don't step on that.
[24:08.50]That probably makes noise.
[24:15.98]Did you hear- did you hear me?
[24:19.24]Very good.
[24:20.58]I did not hear you traverse the room.
[24:23.45]Grab him by his top of his head and bottom of his head and just twist.
[24:26.45]...that will lead you to your next task.
[24:40.64]What, they're gonna teach me how to kill people?
[24:42.22]Like, ew.
[24:42.42]Whoa.
[24:42.72]I got a weapon.
[24:43.48]You can hold.
[24:44.28]Ow, my hand!
[24:44.70]I feel like I'm in VR.
[24:46.22]This is a VR moment.
[24:46.96]Where is he?
[24:47.68]I can't get him.
[24:48.27]Oh, he's over here.
[24:49.25]Ow!
[24:49.31]Didn't make the noise, but you know.
[25:11.69]Ready your bow.
[25:12.93]Knock an arrow and draw back the string by holding down the attack button.
[25:16.30]Make sure you draw all the way back, or your shot will not have full power.
[25:20.26]Take aim.
[25:20.82]When you are ready to shoot, release your attack.
[25:23.96]See if you can hit one of these targets.
[25:26.24]Alright, that mouse sensitivity drops a lot.
[25:32.49]Did I miss every shot?
[25:33.91]What?
[25:34.47]Wait a minute.
[25:38.57]Did I miss every shot?
[25:43.44]What's happening?
[25:48.62]Turn around?
[25:49.12]Oh.
[25:50.00]Headshot.
[25:50.18]Ready your sword.
[26:11.51]Nice.
[26:11.69]You can tell how good you're doing based on the cartoon sound effects.
[26:14.47]The more it sounds like Scooby Doo, the better you know you're doing.
[26:42.05]Wanna go?
[26:42.53]Wait, is this the trainer?
[26:43.41]Wait, did I just get disqualified?
[26:53.30]That hurts.
[27:00.00]His ears are ringing right now.
[27:04.37]Oh, I can block, right?
[27:07.23]Yep.
[27:07.43]Oh, we're not actually fighting.
[27:10.38]It was right in the teeth.
[27:11.76]Alright, let's go.
[27:12.34]Leave me alone.
[27:12.98]Well, he's following me.
[27:17.50]He's literally following me.
[27:19.04]Get away from me.
[27:34.33]That was just like me and my little brother were in a little bit of a fight before we came to dinner.
[27:38.85]And we just got called to dinner and I was like, I gotta get one more!
[27:42.89]Coming, mom!
[27:43.87]Shut up, idiot!
[27:54.42]Okay, so now what?
[27:56.40]Why are you following me around?
[27:57.28]How do we open this?
[28:00.43]Open this.
[28:06.52]Open the door.
[28:08.10]Go to the table?
[28:18.34]What table?
[28:21.08]Yeah.
[28:24.78]apple please pick up all of the items on this table cycle through your inventory to see the objects you have in your pocket okay apple once an object is displayed you may use it healing potion have something to eat if you wish then you may proceed the next test is waiting on the other side of the metal door okay I have a compass too how do I use it oh just up
[28:47.58]The door is locked, but the key from the table will open it.
[28:50.40]To unlock the door, select the key in your inventory.
[28:53.36]Center the door on screen until it lights up, then use the key on the door.
[28:57.20]Good.
[28:57.54]Now head down this hallway to get to your next test.
[29:00.35]What's the next test?
[29:03.15]Apples are nice.
[29:04.21]Well, only one kind of apple is worth eating, in my opinion.
[29:06.51]Well, two.
[29:08.45]Green or Macintosh.
[29:10.65]The rest of them are dog shit.
[29:12.71]First, climb the rope by jumping onto it.
[29:16.28]Move while looking up or down to climb up or down the rope.
[29:19.10]So you can look up.
[29:19.98]Okay, it's not S. It's just W. Now climb the rope to get to the top of the platform.
[29:26.13]Well done.
[29:26.83]Run and jump across the gap to the other side of the stream.
[29:29.49]I feel like I'm not running fast enough.
[29:31.33]Is this how fast I can go?
[29:34.81]This obstacle is easy to climb if you know how.
[29:37.73]First, move close to the wall.
[29:39.95]Next, jump to grab the edge of the wall and pull yourself up.
[29:43.44]Good job.
[29:44.38]I'm most pleased with your progress.
[29:46.56]I just breathed on it.
[29:48.16]Alright.
[29:48.70]If you wish, you may stay to practice your climbing and jumping or swimming, ducking, leaning, or crawling.
[29:53.60]Okay, this ball damage.
[29:54.24]When you are finished, you may return to your chambers by going through that red door.
[29:58.84]Farewell.
[29:59.28]Okay, so it's jump.
[30:03.18]Let go.
[30:07.46]Alright, let's do it.
[30:15.45]Mushroom?
[30:17.41]Oh shit, mushroom.
[30:19.49]Eat it.
[30:20.77]What is that?
[30:21.77]What happened?
[30:24.58]Wait, what happened?
[30:25.28]Wait, no!
[30:25.86]I wanted to explore!
[30:26.70]Alright.
[30:38.06]So now I'm an expert thief.
[30:46.46]You didn't explore... Don't need to explore the tutorial.
[30:48.82]Well, I just wanted to see.
[30:49.53]I was just curious.
[30:57.19]Where are my parents?
[30:58.55]I don't know.
[31:00.67]The most promising acolyte left us.
[31:02.90]Not out of the lesser folly of sentiment.
[31:08.33]the greater folly of anger.
[31:12.31]His heart was clouded and his balance was lost, but his abilities were unmatched.
[31:19.41]Even then, we knew to match, watch him most carefully.
[31:24.47]Keeper, Annals.
[31:32.45]Stealing is wrong.
[31:34.98]Break into a mansion.
[31:35.60]Steal a trinket and leave quietly.
[31:37.43]Alright.
[31:56.56]The front gate of Lord Bafford's Manor is always guarded, and the main street is far too exposed.
[32:01.94]Sounds like the guy in Hitman's Freight.
[32:03.25]But Cuddy tells me there's a better way in.
[32:05.91]Around to the side, more out of the way.
[32:08.55]One guard, and likely no witnesses to complicate matters.
[32:15.67]The piece Cuddy wants is a scepter.
[32:16.99]Miss Burnwood.
[32:18.19]Silver, jewels, the usual adornments.
[32:21.19]It should command a high price.
[32:23.65]Bafford, like most of his kind, probably keeps his treasures on the top floor of the place.
[32:28.19]Top floor.
[32:28.67]Close to his heart.
[32:30.31]And far from his servants.
[32:32.19]I'm telling you, all I need, just give me two bricks.
[32:33.73]Give me two bricks.
[32:35.92]An extra large heel.
[32:38.06]And a fucking ski mask.
[32:45.25]I'll get what you need.
[32:46.03]I'll get up there and get that trinket.
[32:55.52]Sneak into Lord Bafford's Manor and case the place.
[33:00.60]Wellhouse in back is your best bet if you can get the key from the guard.
[33:04.92]Blackjacking or pickpocketing him would be quietest.
[33:09.47]Find the prized scepter and redistribute it to yourself.
[33:16.41]Try to do it without causing too much commotion?
[33:18.63]Alright, so I gotta get into the manor.
[33:27.73]There's a well house out the back.
[33:29.52]I can get the key from the guard.
[33:31.34]Or just, alright.
[33:32.34]I gotta get in there.
[33:35.78]Starting gear.
[33:37.28]I got a blackjack, a sword, archery, healing potion, water arrow.
[33:42.52]Water arrow does not do any damage, but it douses torches and other burning... Okay, that's really important.
[33:49.54]What is blackjack?
[33:50.30]This weapon will knock out an unsuspecting target with little noise and no blood.
[33:53.72]Oh, okay.
[33:56.00]Alright.
[33:57.82]Let's go.
[34:01.15]Where am I?
[34:01.85]Pfft.
[34:04.09]Watch... Okay.
[34:05.67]Watch for interior patrols.
[34:07.26]There's the front entrance.
[34:08.58]This is heavily guarded.
[34:09.66]Do not try frontal assault.
[34:12.26]Arrow cache pickup en route to the second floor.
[34:15.82]One guard.
[34:17.74]This well leads to the basement.
[34:19.12]Basement entrance.
[34:20.48]Okay, we're gonna try to go to the basement.
[34:22.72]So I gotta go to the right here.
[34:24.63]This way.
[34:26.31]I drew this map.
[34:27.15]I hope it helps.
[34:27.97]Is it illegal for me to, like, be right here?
[34:31.07]No, I... I haven't done anything illegal.
[34:35.02]Alright, I haven't done anything illegal, though.
[34:36.50]So, like, it's okay that I... Alright, so that's the front door.
[34:43.37]Go in the front.
[34:47.91]It's three guards.
[34:48.59]I don't think I... Let me try... Let me see... Let me go to the well.
[34:56.19]It's a well out back.
[34:58.43]There's a cheese factory.
[35:00.12]I can't go in there.
[35:02.08]Alright, here's the... Here's the underground well.
[35:11.53]You can't fight all these people at once.
[35:12.95]I mean, I can, but it's probably bad.
[35:14.50]Alright, where am I at?
[35:18.52]There's one guard.
[35:19.40]I'm okay.
[35:19.74]Here's the well.
[35:20.48]That's where I am right now.
[35:23.68]So there's a guard here.
[35:25.04]Basement entrance.
[35:25.84]The well leads to the basement waterway.
[35:27.44]Basement waterway.
[35:28.26]I got it.
[35:29.04]Alright, cool.
[35:29.50]I have to save the game.
[35:35.25]Well, that would have been a fucking disaster.
[35:39.96]Where's the blackjack?
[35:41.06]Alright, so this thing... Alright, this thing you just whack somebody's head.
[35:45.26]Alright, this will go up to the basement.
[35:48.96]Is anybody here?
[35:49.54]This doesn't look like a basement.
[36:08.33]What's this way?
[36:09.83]Oh, okay.
[36:10.19]This is where I am right now.
[36:11.13]So I'm underground.
[36:12.57]Keep going.
[36:13.68]Thank God it tells you where you are.
[36:14.76]Okay.
[36:19.76]Basement.
[36:34.12]There's a door.
[36:36.31]Oh, shit.
[36:36.97]Hold on.
[36:41.34]God damn it, give me a break.
[36:45.94]Can I get in this door?
[36:46.66]Alright, stealth, stealth, stealth, stealth, stealth.
[36:53.29]Somebody's coming, somebody's coming.
[36:55.89]Water, water, water, water arrows, water arrows.
[37:00.69]Oh shit.
[37:06.11]How many times do I have to shoot somebody in the head before they die?
[37:08.91]What?
[37:12.69]How do I move the body?
[37:21.31]Oh my god.
[37:21.77]Alright, dump him.
[37:22.53]Dump him down here.
[37:23.05]Okay.
[37:30.28]I gotta get rid of the blood.
[37:31.06]Alright, that's one guard.
[37:37.80]Alright.
[37:39.06]Save it.
[37:39.66]F11?
[37:39.72]F11?
[37:42.66]What's that?
[37:49.82]What?
[37:50.24]I can't go in here.
[37:51.01]This... I can't open this door.
[37:53.99]I thought this was a place into the mansion.
[37:57.39]Wait a minute.
[37:57.89]I need to figure out how do I put the other arrows on.
[38:04.14]How do I do it?
[38:04.94]It was in the options.
[38:09.35]Okay, water at four.
[38:11.23]So I just have it up at four.
[38:12.97]There we go.
[38:13.33]Alright, so what if I do this?
[38:14.81]I just need to test this and see what happens.
[38:17.27]I didn't do anything.
[38:23.63]What?
[38:26.38]What the f- No, no, no.
[38:33.52]I want to get points.
[38:34.06]This guy's drunk.
[38:36.44]Alright, wait.
[38:36.88]What do I do about this guy?
[38:44.07]Can you see me?
[38:59.10]This is not very stealthy.
[39:00.74]Where's he going?
[39:02.66]Where are you going?
[39:05.92]Oh, he's got the key.
[39:07.00]He's got the key.

[39:25.24]Yep, nice.
[39:29.06]Hold down.
[39:30.06]Yeah, I can do like a big swing.
[39:33.29]Can I take the beer?
[39:35.35]I can.
[39:35.89]Oh, it's a bottle.
[39:37.97]Don't do that.

[40:01.45]There's the well.
[40:12.90]That was a tuber reaction.
[40:15.18]It was genuine, though.
[40:16.04]Alright, so I have to go down the well.
[40:18.78]Am I gonna get hurt?
[40:23.88]Save it.
[40:28.33]Alright, so now I'm underneath the estate, right?
[40:33.29]This is all pre-recorded.

[43:54.20]I'm making so much noise here.
[43:55.94]Okay, you know what?
[43:56.84]This is actually good because they're not going to investigate this because they just probably assume a raccoon is in here.

[50:17.39]I got the bludgeoner.
[50:24.65]Excuse me?
[50:34.08]Ah!
[50:34.38]Is it like Resident Evil?

[52:17.45]Mushroom.

[53:45.98]Okay, there's the kitchen.
[53:46.75]There's the chef.

[53:49.79]The chef is making a delicious meal of apples.
[53:55.33]I gotta knock you out, man.
[53:56.15]I'm sorry.
[53:58.29]What was that?
[53:59.56]What?
[54:00.72]Look there.
[54:04.42]I hit the chandelier.
[54:06.42]Oh, give me all these crunchies.
[54:12.33]I didn't kill him.
[54:16.59]I'm not going to be a weirdo.
[54:18.11]I'm going to put him in a place where he's going to wake up in a few hours and everything's going to be fine.
[54:21.71]I'm going to hide him over here.
[54:30.46]Okay.
[54:32.91]There's a note right here.
[54:33.65]What does it say?
[54:35.97]Cedric, please speak to Cook about last night's dinner.
[54:38.93]While technically the menu conformed to my instructions, I suspect that the lamb was somewhat older than this spring's, and I am in no way fooled by his practice of warming the salad to disguise wilting.
[54:51.93]if cook is incapable of finding adequate ingredients he can be replaced and if he offers those same excuses about the stone market shortages please remind him that the grocery budget is a good 50 above last year's figures and even he should be able to procure adequate uh victuals at those prices okay all we have is bread oh carrots
[55:20.39]Bread.
[55:20.65]A little mallet.
[55:29.90]At least he's... Oh, a pan.
[55:33.82]More cheese.
[55:35.04]I need to... I should probably eat some of this stuff.
[55:39.13]Does this heal?
[55:42.45]I don't see it.
[55:42.85]This doesn't heal.
[55:49.89]Hope you're having fun.
[55:50.51]I'm having fun.
[55:53.62]Oh, I can't alt tab this game.
[55:54.80]Let me see.
[55:55.16]Okay.
[56:04.71]I got it on my phone.
[56:23.37]The fuck is all this, man?
[56:31.75]I'm not even gonna... I'm not even gonna react to this.
[56:35.03]I'm not even gonna react to it.
[56:36.63]That's it.
[56:39.71]I'm gonna play thief.
[56:48.14]I'm just playing thief.
[56:49.04]I'm just playing a game of thief.
[56:49.92]That's it.
[56:50.68]That's it.
[56:50.94]We're gonna keep going.
[56:57.32]What was that?
[56:59.92]Please, I just, I just browsed it for a second, alright?
[57:03.64]I saw it, I saw it.
[57:04.48]Alright, where am I now?
[57:14.47]Alright, I gotta get up here into the interior courtyard.
[57:26.33]Is it like a secret door?
[57:27.05]No, nothing.
[57:28.11]I thought these were coffins.
[57:36.01]Alright.
[57:36.45]I gotta get upstairs.
[57:42.47]What is all this?
[57:45.61]Are you mad at us?
[57:48.22]I'm mad at you.
[57:50.02]Whoa!
[57:51.30]I just stole a bunch of stuff.
[57:52.34]Okay, cool.
[58:04.20]How did I turn around though?
[58:26.73]My neck just enlarged.
[58:29.59]My neck just stretched like 13 feet.
[58:40.23]Stop it once and- Shit!
[58:43.88]I'm dead.

[59:05.22]What are you talking about?
[59:06.60]What?
[59:06.82]I don't understand.
[59:09.20]Wasn't I saving it?
[59:14.74]Okay, what?
[59:15.68]I was gonna say, that was like 30 minutes of progress. ...
[59:28.55]Alright, I can't mess around.
[59:30.99]This is where I was.
[59:32.89]Get out of the way.
[59:35.89]I gotta get up the stairs.
[59:39.89]Steal some of this stuff.
[59:41.75]Alright, slow down.
[59:44.97]Use your sword on the banners to cut them.
[59:48.02]Really?
[59:50.34]Okay.
[59:51.98]I gotta be careful.
[59:57.12]You can see me?
[60:00.42]Stay out of the light.
[60:01.36]Try headshot this guy with a bow and arrow.
[60:04.30]God damn it.
[60:05.60]I need to throw something up there.
[60:09.08]Stay in the dark.
[60:29.61]Whoa, that guy saw me.
[60:31.55]Oh shit.
[60:33.45]Oh shit.
[60:34.45]Oh shit.
[60:34.83]What if I just stay hidden?
[60:46.71]Where is he?
[61:01.09]Why would you still be using your bow?
[61:02.49]Just duck.
[61:04.85]Come under the stairs.
[61:11.93]Alright, here's the second floor right here.
[61:13.01]We got it.
[61:13.29]Oh, they're coming in.
[61:14.75]Oh, shit.
[61:36.86]Get him out of the light.
[61:45.02]I think I'm okay.
[61:45.54]I think I can go up the stairs now.
[61:47.44]Alright, go.
[62:01.99]Where am I now?
[62:03.03]Alright.
[62:05.09]Where is this guy?
[62:05.86]I'm almost in his quarters.
[62:13.26]Minecraft sounds.
[62:14.18]These are Minecraft sounds.
[62:19.13]What's in here?
[62:22.13]Oh boy.
[62:23.63]Upstairs to the private chambers.
[62:34.48]The bottom of the screen is light level.
[62:35.92]Nobody will see you if it's dark.
[62:38.48]Somebody had a lot of good advice there.
[62:42.03]Nothing?
[62:44.93]Ooh, wait.
[62:45.91]Nice.
[62:51.07]Okay.
[62:51.91]You can load preset controls.
[62:53.33]Blackjack only works if they don't know you're there.
[62:56.93]If you pick something up and it doesn't go in your inventory, it's not worth anything.
[63:02.48]Export is not harder, just more objectives.
[63:04.56]Oh, okay.
[63:07.64]So this only works if you... I have to... They can't see me.
[63:11.08]But if they don't see me, is it an instant KO?
[63:20.39]Yes.
[63:20.65]Okay, cool.
[63:22.19]There's no... What's up here?
[63:26.09]I thought those were guards.
[63:32.71]Nothing up here.
[63:38.07]This only works with the blackjack, okay.
[63:42.79]Oh, we got a goblet here.
[63:46.18]Nice.
[63:46.68]Does it say how much this stuff was worth at the end?
[64:03.48]I just ate a lot of food.
[64:04.52]What does food even do?
[64:05.62]Alright, we gotta go up, not down.
[64:15.16]Okay, I cannot be seen right now.
[64:16.54]Okay, I'm... Oh, no, no, no, easy, easy.
[64:29.97]There's probably somebody in the courtyard.
[64:40.29]Alright, we're fine don't just load thank God I saved and loaded the same exact time I think This is creepy.
[65:00.30]What is this?
[65:00.62]Yeah, alright
[65:08.99]Walk on the carpet.
[65:10.11]Where am I?
[65:10.51]I haven't mentioned second floor.
[65:14.91]Throne room is right up here.
[65:17.96]Is he in the throne room?
[65:26.70]It's like the big dining hall.
[65:36.81]What is this?
[65:38.72]Is this like a secret room?
[65:48.12]Oh, fuck you.
[65:51.04]Stay right here.
[66:01.21]Alright, if he's already seen me...
[66:12.45]Does that mean... Can I still get him in one hit?
[66:22.26]Yes.
[66:22.50]Okay, good.
[66:35.59]I'm just saving it every five steps.
[66:40.09]What?
[66:40.51]How is that possible?
[66:41.57]No.
[66:41.92]Reload.
[66:45.65]There's an intruder here.
[66:49.35]Somebody's seeing me.
[66:52.45]I'm making noise.
[66:53.37]Oh, whatever.
[66:54.29]I don't have to hit anybody.
[66:55.22]Let's just go.
[66:55.58]Okay, so where's my orientation here?
[67:06.58]Rune room is this way.
[67:08.70]The tile floor is really loud, yeah.
[67:13.53]I have to go that way.
[67:23.14]Shit.
[67:23.84]Okay, we're fine.
[67:24.28]Is this a big bath?
[67:35.00]What?
[67:35.14]Do you hear me go in the water?
[67:37.42]Oh, great.
[67:38.06]That's not good.
[67:38.74]Does he care?
[67:43.60]I don't think he cares.
[67:45.76]Don't let me come find you.
[67:53.00]Just don't move?
[67:53.84]In the water?
[68:00.14]I want to go inside of that thing, but I don't want to.
[68:07.07]Oh, boy.
[68:14.39]You killed me in one hit?
[68:15.57]Are you kidding me?
[68:16.03]What do I have for armor?
[68:33.08]No, fuck off.
[68:34.22]I got it.
[68:35.62]He didn't see me.
[68:43.70]I'm fine.
[68:52.53]Where's this other guy?
[68:53.17]I had nobody here.
[68:58.35]Am I going to the throne room?
[69:01.04]I'm going back down.
[69:05.60]Shit.
[69:06.26]Can you jump from carpet to carpet?
[69:21.70]Will they hear me jumping?
[69:22.72]Alright, water arrows.
[69:33.07]So I can do this on torches, you said, right?
[69:37.90]You gotta use the rubber chicken with the pulley in the middle.
[69:42.84]That just scared the absolute shit out of me.
[69:47.54]Why did that scare me so much?
[69:48.70]I didn't expect he was gonna be that close to me.
[69:51.00]This guy's got golden armor on.
[70:06.03]Swing at me, please!
[70:15.41]Give me a goddamn break.
[70:22.25]Alright, jump from place to place.
[70:27.50]Holy shit, it worked.
[70:35.22]It worked.
[70:37.80]What a bunch of geniuses, seriously.
[70:44.52]Hit you in the dark.
[70:45.16]Alright.
[70:46.00]I have the... Save it.
[70:47.34]I have the key to the throne room now.
[70:51.44]I wonder if he reads them or if it's just for show.
[70:55.78]Recent delivery of antiquities from Vaan.
[71:00.18]Contains several items which we felt might be of interest to you.
[71:03.02]Descriptions follow, but you are welcome to drop by our shop to examine them or other goods in person.
[71:07.60]An ornamental scepter, three feet in length.
[71:10.20]That's huge.
[71:13.79]The body of the stave is weird.
[71:15.85]Carved in the star and dot pattern.
[71:18.41]Six inches of the ferrule and five inches of the grip are bound with burnished copper overlaid by an ink and glaze crackadare varnish.
[71:27.20]It's pretty good looking, I think.
[71:29.62]Cloud stone, one of the finest of its type we have seen.
[71:31.74]A treasure box of two feet by three feet of four feet by silver birch wood.
[71:36.23]The lid is really pretty.
[71:39.76]The inside of the box contains two principal compartments, one with glass shelves, and it's very, it's expensive.
[71:44.86]Ooh.
[71:51.80]Dog bone.
[71:52.22]Okay, let's keep going.
[72:03.54]Where am I now?
[72:04.78]Alright, I definitely have a key to the throne room.
[72:10.44]Healing potion key.
[72:11.68]That's a big key.
[72:14.30]Where's the throne room, though?
[72:23.23]Where did that guy come from?
[72:30.97]I've played enough Dark Souls to be able to do this.
[72:32.93]Okay, never mind.
[72:46.80]Where did he come from?
[73:03.05]No, don't shoot it.
[73:04.21]How do I pull it back?
[73:09.41]What happened?
[73:09.73]I hit him in the leg and he died.
[73:10.74]Alright, we're good.
[73:12.52]Alright, I think I gotta go down that hallway.
[73:33.03]Let me see, I can cut the banners.
[73:34.67]I'm curious what that means.
[73:38.37]What does that do?
[73:38.89]I need the throne room.
[73:48.02]Now I'm on this edge, I gotta go over here.
[73:50.04]I wish I had an indicator of where I was.
[73:54.88]It's probably the courtyard, right?
[73:56.14]Press Y to fart.
[74:01.44]I mean, I did it just to be curious.
[74:07.68]I have a compass.
[74:08.32]It's a grenade?
[74:12.52]Alright, so what is the compass telling me to go?
[74:14.44]So the compass is pointing in the direction I need to go?
[74:20.52]Or, okay, so is this north, south, east, right?
[74:26.63]Is that correct?
[74:29.33]So I gotta go this way.
[74:34.39]Right?
[74:34.57]Because this would be east.
[74:41.92]The painted top is facing north, right?
[74:44.93]Guys, I haven't looked at a compass in probably 20 years.
[74:50.23]I don't even care what they are.
[74:53.13]This is pointing north.
[74:55.08]So that means that if I'm going this way, that I'm currently going east.
[75:01.06]That's correct?
[75:05.94]Yes, okay, right.
[75:06.52]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[75:07.83]Alright.
[75:09.85]Alright.
[75:11.58]So I gotta go, there we go, through that door.
[75:14.84]Yep.
[75:15.86]Okay, here we go.
[75:16.46]This is the, is it?
[75:25.20]This is, that's his throne, right?
[75:26.84]No, it's a bed.
[75:27.44]I thought it was, okay.
[75:29.02]From this angle, it looked like a big throne.
[75:31.06]He's got a lot of money, though.
[75:33.66]Another key.
[75:40.34]What?
[75:40.62]I don't know.
[75:47.03]Alright.
[75:49.63]Where am I now?
[75:50.61]Not the throne room.
[75:51.39]Okay, it's another door on this side then?
[75:54.37]This is a personal bedroom.
[75:55.17]Right here.
[75:59.45]Yep.
[76:04.11]Okay, this is locked.
[76:05.61]This is locked.
[76:07.49]Is he in here?
[76:08.09]I don't know.
[76:25.15]No.
[76:28.31]Here's a flash bomb.
[76:34.47]Wait.
[76:55.63]Ah!
[76:57.65]I got him.
[76:57.89]Is that a gong?
[77:05.57]Don't touch that.
[77:06.05]That's definitely like... That's probably like an alarm.
[77:10.86]Alright.
[77:12.04]I made it to the throne room.
[77:15.22]There it is.
[77:18.70]I found the scepter.
[77:19.36]Okay.
[77:22.68]Scepter's right here.
[77:24.95]Here we go.
[77:26.17]Hell yeah.
[77:36.02]I did it.
[77:38.80]30 minutes, found 705 loot.
[77:40.54]I picked one pocket.
[77:44.74]Zero knockouts out of... Wait, zero knockouts?
[77:47.26]How?
[77:49.20]Innocence killed.
[77:49.88]Some.
[77:49.98]That's such a weird statistic.
[77:54.40]It doesn't say how many.
[77:56.70]Innocence killed.
[77:57.33]I don't know.
[77:58.21]A few.
[78:00.15]I was not paying attention.
[78:01.51]When I was writing down my debriefing, I don't remember how many innocent people I killed.
[78:05.65]So I just wrote some.
[78:08.37]And others.
[78:12.76]Some and others.
[78:13.74]I don't know.
[78:14.16]Whatever.
[78:14.40]I don't know who they were.
[78:18.95]That was kind of fun.
[78:23.86]You didn't hit the gong?
[78:24.66]I didn't think I was going to end the mission right there.
[78:26.48]Am I melting this down?
[78:47.97]Someone just called Thief an unknown game that I dug up.
[78:51.19]It got remade, what, four or five years ago?
[78:54.69]Didn't they kind of do a remake?
[79:00.05]I think so.
[79:06.90]It was a reboot.
[79:08.46]That was ten years ago.
[79:10.44]Wait, what?
[79:11.42]It was ten years ago?
[79:12.72]I thought that was like two years ago.
[79:16.45]It was 2014, really?
[79:16.91]Shit.
[79:25.07]It was 2012.
[79:26.13]They're holding Cuddy in a mining complex carved out of a quarry.
[79:30.14]The quarry's flooded, but the hammers still work the top-level mines and have converted part of the complex into a penitentiary for those who violate their tenets.
[79:39.34]The face came off of this one?
[79:40.94]An associate of mine was confined there.
[79:43.01]That was weird.
[79:43.41]I don't know what happened there.
[79:45.83]It would be difficult to get in by way of the main gate, but there is another option.
[79:50.81]The mines break the surface of a hill south of the quarry.
[79:54.33]Hairline check.
[79:54.77]You got it.
[79:55.23]It's alright.
[79:55.71]Getting worse, but it's okay.
[79:56.55]Alright, so I gotta break... Break people out of jail?
[80:22.65]Oh, your map doesn't show the way through the mine, so you're going to have to scout around to make your way to where they hold the prisoners.
[80:28.79]Cutty still owes you for the baffer job.
[80:30.93]Break him out and you'll get your cash.
[80:32.53]Alright.
[80:35.71]Come back.
[80:36.57]Hold on, let me, like, get the camera to look okay.
[80:41.53]Let me, wait, let me just get this done.
[80:44.03]This is, uh, dog bone.
[80:48.67]Wait, how much is this?
[80:50.35]I can buy this?
[80:51.11]It's a tip.
[80:54.82]It's 300 bucks.
[80:56.68]And it reveals where the hammers are keeping Cuddy.
[81:01.06]Speed potion.
[81:01.80]This potion will greatly increase your speed for a little while.
[81:03.83]I can just bunny hop.
[81:06.55]Former prisoner... I thought it said in Craigslist.
[81:09.87]A former prisoner of Craigscleft says he has info about the haunted mines.
[81:14.99]How many arrows?
[81:15.59]I have plenty of these.
[81:17.05]Moss arrow.
[81:20.46]Oh, okay.
[81:21.06]That's actually really helpful.
[81:22.48]Noisemaker?
[81:24.44]Yeah, I want those.
[81:25.32]Okay.
[81:31.20]I think I'm alright.
[81:31.84]Is there anything?
[81:33.78]Maybe I should buy another healing potion.
[81:35.72]250?
[81:35.84]I think it's worth it.
[81:39.18]Probably buy it.
[81:43.77]It's worth it.
[81:47.40]Your cash does not carry over between missions.
[81:49.64]It does not.
[81:53.83]So should I just buy everything?
[81:55.93]Okay, so there's no point.
[81:57.81]Wait, give me that hot tip.
[82:00.93]I want to know exactly where he is.
[82:01.85]Give me the hot tip and give me a potion.
[82:06.62]And how many arrows do I need?
[82:08.34]Maybe a couple more of these moss arrows?
[82:09.56]30 cents?
[82:12.92]Alright, I think that's good.
[82:17.17]Spend it all.
[82:17.67]Alright, yeah, that's good to know.
[82:19.72]Alright, this one, I'm gonna save it right here.
[82:21.52]I'm gonna do, like, a hard save.
[82:25.82]Let me get my camera to work.
[82:26.70]Because the camera's, like, all buggy right now.
[82:30.96]Hold on, let me turn on the ring light.
[82:37.95]I've got a ring light.
[82:43.15]Okay.
[82:44.61]How does that look?
[82:47.02]That look better or worse?
[82:47.98]Needs to be a little bit brighter.
[82:53.14]Like that.
[82:58.55]Looks alright.
[82:59.03]Is that better?
[83:06.67]There, look, I've got my ring light on now.
[83:12.83]Okay.
[83:18.73]How's that look?
[83:19.79]Fine?
[83:20.69]Do we look okay?
[83:24.08]I'm not putting the ring light around my neck.
[83:26.40]It's not happening.
[83:28.66]No.
[83:29.06]Maybe if I can confirm that it's going to be safe, I'll do it.
[83:31.26]Alright, you get facecam for a half of one mission.
[83:35.49]Here we go.
[83:45.17]I hope I didn't need that.
[83:50.32]One full mission.
[83:51.26]Oh, no.
[83:51.48]There is no deal.
[83:52.30]I just turned it on and the white balance is wrong anyways.
[83:54.40]Who cares?
[83:54.98]Let me fix that quick.
[83:55.76]I don't know.
[84:01.43]It resets my camera settings every time I start.
[84:10.69]It's better.
[84:12.33]No.
[84:19.58]There we go.
[84:19.96]That's like what it looks like in this room right now.
[84:22.48]Like that.
[84:24.86]Okay.
[84:25.61]That's fine.
[84:30.53]Is it a blue light?
[84:31.85]I didn't even... Whatever.
[84:33.03]I don't care.
[84:33.41]Let's just go.
[84:33.77]Alright.
[84:35.71]I gotta go through the mines and I gotta find the... I gotta find the person.
[84:39.41]I gotta break the person out.
[84:43.47]Can I smash somebody's head with a boulder?
[84:45.25]I hope so.
[84:45.69]We're gonna try it.
[84:56.84]You're such a Bostonian.
[84:58.04]Not anymore.
[85:01.20]I've been not in Massachusetts for quite a while now.
[85:08.26]Swim down.
[85:15.46]So the goal is to get through... I think I need to turn the bright... What happened here?
[85:37.76]That I deserve.
[85:39.40]I did not rea- I don't know what was going on there.
[85:40.96]Okay, give me my boulder back.
[85:50.31]Alright, it's marked on the map where he is, right?
[85:53.63]Mine's prison factory.
[85:55.05]This is like Dante's Inferno.
[85:59.29]These are the layers of hell.
[86:02.20]These are the layers.
[86:09.98]What's this?
[86:13.24]I thought that was an enemy.
[86:14.36]I thought that was a person coming to get me.
[86:18.83]What does that do?
[86:22.87]Can I slash this?
[86:26.88]What does this do?
[86:30.84]Put water arrows in it?
[86:31.88]That's not a bad idea.
[86:43.55]Holy waters will kill zombies.
[86:45.29]There are no zombies in this game.
[87:00.39]There are zombies in this game.
[87:12.74]That didn't do anything.
[87:13.64]That didn't do anything.
[87:21.25]Where's the water?
[87:32.89]Factory.
[87:39.00]There it is.
[87:39.32]Do I have to, like, bless myself?
[87:41.46]Alright.
[87:43.99]I'm blessed.
[87:50.85]It only lasts for 30 seconds?
[87:53.91]And it doesn't kill in one... Holy shit.
[88:00.00]Okay.
[88:11.37]What do I do about this?
[88:12.04]I'm going to get up there somehow.
[88:28.75]I'm going to turn the game up.
[88:29.73]I'm going to turn the game up, I think.
[88:31.45]Is that safe to go down there?
[88:36.73]I'm going to turn the game up.
[88:47.03]I'll turn the game up.
[88:52.63]It's probably better, right?
[88:53.33]I have more.
[88:57.23]This is cheating probably, but I don't care.
[89:01.77]It's a bind to lean over edges and look down.
[89:04.21]I think I'm supposed to go down here.
[89:11.28]Or up, I guess.
[89:20.59]How high should I go?
[89:23.45]Somebody's dead right there.
[89:26.83]Save it.
[89:33.30]Is that guy a zombie?
[89:37.14]I think so, yeah.
[89:41.87]Can I just... Okay, can I kill him?
[89:43.53]Like, with the sword.
[89:49.84]Is this the zombie?
[89:50.90]He's just breathing.
[89:55.22]What happened?
[89:58.64]Is he dead?
[89:59.28]Ah!
[89:59.64]Dude, somebody was right near me.
[90:00.68]What happened?
[90:01.34]What?
[90:02.10]It's not even fucking scary.
[90:03.30]Relax.
[90:03.84]Don't overreact for no reason.
[90:05.76]Overactor.
[90:06.60]Overreactor.
[90:08.98]I thought that was him breathing.
[90:11.54]I can't hurt him.
[90:12.64]Okay, bad.
[90:13.26]You're gonna give me a dead end?
[90:27.53]They're taking up the exact space that I need to run around them.
[90:37.64]I still have a grenade.
[91:02.23]What is happening in this game?
[91:07.75]Okay.
[91:11.17]Is this a haunted house now?
[91:14.95]Alright.
[91:15.61]Okay, I gotta keep going up.
[91:17.35]Keep going north, I guess?
[91:18.95]Or up?
[91:26.08]I hear... I hear humans.
[91:28.62]I hear human life.
[91:41.99]You get one little measly health back for a fucking $300 health potion?
[92:12.71]I have those noise arrows, right?
[92:13.87]Let me use them.
[92:16.37]Moss arrow.
[92:17.87]Noise arrow.
[92:24.38]Who is there?
[92:26.66]I hear thee there.
[92:36.43]Where hast thou gone?
[93:03.20]He's right there Right get him right now.
[93:09.52]Hmm.
[93:10.56]I thought I spied something Hiding shell
[93:20.50]I threw a shovel at him, and he didn't even care.
[93:22.60]Okay.
[93:29.94]That takes care of those, too.
[93:33.76]Where am I at?
[93:34.24]I gotta go up?
[93:35.43]This, uh... I can go up that way, but what's over here?
[93:45.31]Mmm... Is this a secret or something?
[93:47.17]Something I can get?
[93:48.79]I'll check it.
[93:49.23]Why not?
[93:53.08]Oh, I think this is a different entrance.
[93:54.08]Can I swim up it like a salmon?
[93:59.98]No.
[94:00.58]Okay.
[94:01.05]So this is another way to get down here.
[94:05.57]Excuse me.
[94:08.41]What's this?
[94:19.03]Sitting too far, too far, too far, too far.
[94:21.92]I'm gonna get lost if I don't cut it out.
[94:30.00]Guards had keys.
[94:31.55]I think I got them.
[94:34.69]I didn't get the keys?
[94:37.01]I thought when I picked them up, it would just give it to me.
[94:43.35]According to Dickit, a heretic who was recently let out of Craigscliff Cuddy's being held in cell block four.
[94:50.51]Okay, so he's in cell block four.
[94:55.34]They had keys I didn't take.
[94:56.38]Oh shit, okay.
[95:01.88]I thought I was gonna just pick it up on their body.
[95:06.84]Did I not get his key anymore?
[95:14.41]Where is it?
[95:17.53]I don't know.
[95:28.50]Save.
[95:30.10]It was just a potion?
[95:31.16]Alright.
[95:31.50]Cell block four.
[95:37.80]Here we are.
[95:38.38]Careful guard stations.
[95:39.42]Alright.
[95:40.68]Control room, machine rooms, power stations.
[95:42.48]This is to the mine, so we're going through and we're gonna be in the control room.
[95:46.17]Gotta get to the prison.
[95:48.61]Alright.
[95:50.37]Shit.
[96:10.13]Idiot.
[96:11.11]You idiot.
[96:14.35]It's dark right here.
[96:14.97]He can't see me.
[96:17.18]What are you saying?
[96:20.14]Got him.
[96:43.77]Do you have anything on you?
[96:44.55]A key or anything?
[96:45.11]No.
[96:46.45]Alright, move this shit out of the way.
[96:58.25]Mine... Alright, there's a... Okay.
[97:00.72]I need those arrows right now.
[97:06.04]Oh, shit.
[97:06.72]He didn't see it.
[97:07.62]I don't...
[97:21.52]Alright, I'm good.
[97:28.10]I'm gonna go go go go you can't I'm in pitch black right now.

[97:50.24]Alright, toss him in the corner.
[98:00.32]Okay, that's the only thing I can press.
[98:18.29]I thought it was gonna shock the floor.
[98:27.05]I thought it was gonna just electrocute the ground.
[98:28.60]Didn't this?
[98:36.80]That was so loud, my ears hurt.
[98:39.66]Okay.
[98:41.86]Machine rooms, control room.
[98:43.28]We gotta go up here.
[98:48.60]Okay, get to the prison.
[98:49.89]That's all I gotta do.
[98:51.27]Save it right here.
[98:53.37]Why do you like this?
[98:54.33]Because I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and I'm like, irrational and compulsive.
[99:01.18]Very high-strung, neurotic.
[99:02.80]I don't know.
[99:04.92]That's why.
[99:05.84]And I'm like, being cut off.
[99:07.82]Nice excuse.
[99:08.64]I know, it's not an excuse.
[99:09.74]It really isn't, I know.
[99:23.12]I said neurotic, not erotic.
[99:26.68]Open your ears.
[99:27.42]Are there people down here?
[99:34.99]Because this is the... This is the way to get to the factory.
[99:39.23]I mean, to the prison.
[99:43.55]I'm not erotic. ...
[99:54.12]Why does that not work?
[99:58.05]What am I dumping?
[99:58.71]What happened?
[100:08.90]What happened?
[100:09.28]Why did somebody scream?
[100:17.67]What?
[100:20.01]It was me screaming.
[100:26.84]I was not even close.
[100:27.82]Alright, let me fucking take out some people here.
[100:32.99]It's turning into hot fucking magma.
[100:41.69]Come on over here.
[100:43.57]Come on over here.
[100:44.21]Come on over here.
[100:46.27]Come on over here, coward.
[100:47.19]Hey look, he flipped me off.
[100:55.64]Where is he?
[101:05.62]What?
[101:07.07]What is that?
[101:07.71]Pound the snail with me, my friend.
[101:21.62]Where is he going?
[101:23.21]Where are you going?
[101:24.21]Oh, somebody's bleeding.
[101:27.05]Got him.
[101:28.41]Oh, I got a hammer.
[101:29.87]What do I do with this?
[101:55.62]What do I do with the hammer?
[101:57.00]Is somebody still alive?
[101:57.82]Oh, I got two hammers.
[102:12.41]Alright.
[102:15.73]What does this one make?
[102:16.37]This one also makes hammers.
[102:20.11]No, I don't want any of this.
[102:21.27]Just give me the hammer.
[102:38.05]I tried to jump over it.
[102:41.01]Alright, no more messing around.
[102:57.10]Who is there?
[102:58.42]Is someone there?
[102:59.60]Halt!
[103:00.16]Down!
[103:05.55]Fucking idiot.
[103:19.43]He's up here.
[103:19.87]Oh shit.
[103:59.60]Fuck you!
[104:00.54]Come on, dude!
[104:01.42]Don't even-
[104:21.17]Who swings a hammer like this with one hand?
[104:25.17]Like up!
[104:26.45]You can't even do that move.
[104:27.79]That move isn't even possible.
[104:30.24]You can't take a huge two-handed hammer and go like this and have it hit me right square in the front of the nose.
[104:52.59]I got an idea.
[104:59.40]Madka's bad.
[105:00.32]Yeah.
[105:02.04]Something blue thought I saw.
[105:04.66]Move.
[105:06.52]All is quiet now.
[105:11.49]My imagination does run over much.
[105:45.51]You guys have anything on you?
[105:47.51]No.
[106:13.36]Yeah, rats.
[106:14.04]Just rats.
[106:17.55]That guy was singing.
[106:55.27]Alright, he's hidden.
[107:01.71]I think there's one more guy here.
[107:03.63]To the prison.
[107:06.38]Did I make one of these things, though?
[107:07.54]I feel like I need to take one of these.
[107:22.21]In truth, I have never heard such carrying on as this thief's pawn, Cuddy.
[107:28.13]One would think these scum had never faced tribulation in their lives.
[107:32.77]What?
[107:33.05]There's nobody.
[107:34.75]No, you don't look in the coat.
[107:36.07]What?
[107:36.41]You don't look over here.
[107:38.34]Why would you be like, in time, I believe that thief, Cuddy's friend, has some... Why would you be doing that?
[107:45.04]You're just having a conversation.
[107:57.39]There's no way you're as fast as me bee-hopping, bro.
[108:06.43]I'm sorry.
[108:06.95]There's no way.
[108:10.50]You stupid game!
[108:16.14]Whatever.
[108:26.37]What do you mean mad at somebody?
[108:27.39]I'm just saying!
[108:28.61]If you have, okay, if you and I are having a conversation, we're just talking.
[108:34.00]Yes, okay, you're right here.
[108:37.28]Like, this whole space, like, this spot over here in the corner, I am not going to, if I see, like, a squirrel move over there, I'm not going to immediately take a sword out and run over there.
[108:49.40]We're in the middle of a conversation.
[108:50.70]I'm not just going to peer that way and go after whatever it is.
[108:54.98]No, it's not going to happen.
[109:02.57]They're prison guards.
[109:04.94]I have never heard such carrying on as this thief's pawn, Cutty.
[109:10.28]One would think these scum had never faced tribulation in their lives.
[109:15.15]For a time, I thought... Who is there?
[109:22.19]We didn't even know I was there!
[109:24.15]Beware an intruder!
[109:34.36]But I have never heard such carrying on as this thief's pawned cutty.
[109:39.97]One would think these scum had never faced tribulation in their lives.
[109:44.82]For a time, I thought Block 4 might never sleep again for his... What are you telling me?
[109:50.75]That they're prison guards?
[109:51.67]Do you remember they're prison guards?
[109:52.73]They're guards.
[109:53.15]Do you remember they're prison guards?
[109:55.25]I just threw one of those Nerf... You remember those Nerf whistlers?
[110:00.39]The thing that, like, Brett Favre was in the commercial and he threw it like, Ah, look at this.
[110:03.74]I can throw this 100 yards.
[110:05.00]And it goes... I just threw one of those right next to them and they didn't even hear it.
[110:12.45]I just whipped one of those, and you're telling me that they're... Aren't they supposed to be aware?
[110:16.13]It coughs.
[110:19.05]But he quiets now.
[110:21.40]Good.
[110:22.34]Death or Dorim's twill be the same for him in the end.
[110:33.30]No reaction.
[110:37.68]Where hast thou gone?
[110:53.00]The snake shows himself.
[110:55.88]God damn it.
[110:57.06]It just restarted.
[111:05.25]In truth, I have never heard such carrying on as this thief's pawned cutty.
[111:11.19]One would think these scum had never faced tribulation in their lives.
[111:16.04]For a time, I thought Block Four might never sleep again for his coughs.
[111:21.70]Why are they doing this?
[111:22.97]Block four.
[111:23.63]Alright, let's go.
[111:52.94]What happened?
[111:54.28]What happened?
[111:55.08]I'm confused of what just happened.
[112:22.35]This guy didn't see me.
[112:25.69]It was a medieval security camera.
[112:31.27]Who saw me?
[112:31.97]I don't get it.
[112:35.52]It's just like a little thing going like this. ...
[112:53.55]Who can see me right now?
[112:58.29]They didn't even have sound effects like this back then.
[113:04.85]What?
[113:08.83]It's in the ceiling.
[113:10.04]No, it's not.
[113:16.06]That's what's seeing me?
[113:17.90]I thought you guys were making it up.
[113:19.24]I thought that was a joke.
[113:20.26]I thought that was a joke.
[113:22.42]There's a medieval security camera.
[113:28.41]Are you kidding me?
[113:31.83]So what am I supposed to do about that?
[113:35.79]I guess put this out?
[113:38.57]Can it see in the dark?
[113:40.06]Okay, I can't go this way.
[114:03.65]I thought I could get him.
[114:04.41]I thought I could just go into the window. ...
[114:23.68]So can I go under here and then above?
[114:26.00]I guess I can wrap around, maybe I can go up?
[114:32.49]I don't know.
[114:32.87]It's steampunk.
[114:35.99]You know, steampunk is like the Jedi hand wave.
[114:42.59]Or all fiction.
[114:51.11]Who passes there?
[114:55.94]It's steampunk, therefore it's fine.
[115:00.96]Steampunk, therefore it's fine.
[115:06.06]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[115:15.40]Okay, alright.
[115:17.17]Very clearly, that guy's got a key.
[115:23.53]Use the walk button?
[115:30.20]I'm thinking about just running in.
[115:38.73]Somebody comes up here and patrols, and I need to be aware of that.
[115:42.97]Just rush in.
[115:43.73]I can't just rush in.
[115:46.36]I think I can...
[115:54.22]He heard you walk?
[115:55.12]I think I have to go down to the sewer.
[115:56.72]As much as I don't want to.
[115:57.56]Okay, this guy's coming over here.
[116:02.50]I'll knock this guy out.
[116:03.42]Get in the corner.
[116:11.93]The light goes out for a minute.
[116:12.95]It does.
[116:15.59]One, two, three.
[116:21.75]I see the fear.
[116:34.71]This guy's just gargling in the mirror.
[116:46.12]What is that?
[116:47.72]Who goes?
[116:48.82]Nobody.
[116:49.56]Nobody goes.
[116:50.34]A plague on these rats.
[116:53.28]When do I go?
[116:54.80]Oh, that's not much time at all.
[116:56.47]One, two, one, two, three, go.
[116:57.23]Who comes unto me?
[117:04.63]Did I save it?
[117:05.13]Save it, save it, save it.
[117:07.74]Cell Block 4.
[117:22.43]What is he in?
[117:24.09]I need my hot tip.
[117:28.29]According to Dickett, a heretic who was recently let out of Craigscleft, Cuddy, is being held in Cell Block 4.
[117:35.49]How do I distract this guy?
[117:41.93]I need it.
[117:42.49]I need help.
[117:42.81]Alright.
[117:43.14]Let's see what I can do.
[117:46.22]Noise arrow?
[117:50.58]I hear somebody coming over here.
[117:53.06]Oh god.
[117:53.50]Oh god, what do I do?
[117:54.04]What do I do?
[117:55.06]Oh god, what do I do?
[118:00.67]Let me in!
[118:01.53]Let me in!
[118:01.79]Open the door!
[118:02.15]Open the door!
[118:02.57]Open!
[118:04.90]Intruder!
[118:05.56]Where?
[118:05.98]Where an intruder?
[118:06.92]Get out of here.
[118:07.70]Got him.
[118:08.20]We good?
[118:08.54]Die trickery shall not last.
[118:38.09]Where is this guy?
[118:41.01]Oh shit.
[119:06.89]You piece of... No way.
[119:09.81]No way.
[119:12.53]What is going on over there?
[119:20.05]No, turn it off.
[119:20.87]Turn it off.
[119:21.95]Turn that off.
[119:27.95]Kill this motherfucker.
[119:29.87]What?
[119:43.76]I was just kidding.
[119:44.40]I was just testing to see if it worked.
[119:46.80]We were just having an electrical test to see if it worked or not.
[119:51.56]If we were just having an electrical test.
[120:00.83]Get out of the fucking way.
[120:01.91]He's in the way.
[120:16.28]The builder shall spy thee if I cannot.
[120:21.38]You gotta be kidding me, dude.
[120:22.58]He's gonna go, I'm gonna go channel two.
[120:25.60]He's kidding me.
[120:27.44]Run away, coward.
[120:29.25]Run away, coward.
[120:32.19]Alright, no more Alex Jones.
[120:36.67]He's, oh, oh, yeah.
[120:38.47]I can't get in there now, can I?
[120:46.57]You didn't think I was going to be able to get in and get you, did you?
[120:58.12]Ah, now you can't get in.
[120:59.64]Now I can stay here.
[121:04.82]Awesome.
[121:05.60]Lady Taker.
[121:06.64]Lisa Vandal.
[121:08.15]Wills.
[121:09.11]Number six.
[121:10.43]Cuddy.
[121:21.99]How do I turn this off?
[121:30.18]Good luck!
[121:31.62]It's kind of crazy out there.
[121:33.70]That guy's gonna get fucking grabbed.
[121:48.72]Who's cell do I have?
[121:50.66]Where's six?
[121:52.25]Hey, Cuddy, come on, come with me.
[121:53.97]We got to get out of here immediately.
[122:00.62]Speak into my ear.
[122:02.76]Good thing you're dying, Cuddy, or I'd have to kill you for sniffing me again.
[122:08.06]Snap, snap, puppy.
[122:11.16]But I owe you, so...
[122:14.56]I'm imagining the guy that ran out first.
[122:17.04]They're all gonna just pile on top of that guy.
[122:21.18]And, like, he's the bad guy.
[122:22.50]He's the one that broke out.
[122:25.46]He caused all this.
[122:27.47]What happened to you?
[122:30.05]What?! !
[122:46.03]What's wrong with him?
[122:50.97]Was that supposed to happen?
[122:53.23]I'll get him out.
[122:54.90]What's the new objective?
[123:01.60]I failed this one.
[123:02.58]Okay.
[123:03.40]Find the evidence locker and retrieve Felix's map.
[123:05.56]Alright, evidence locker.
[123:11.39]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[123:12.57]Okay, barracks and officers' quarters.
[123:14.15]We've got to go this way.
[123:20.60]Do I save it?
[123:21.48]I feel like I shouldn't.
[123:26.18]How do I get out of here?
[123:42.18]Level two.
[123:42.86]Alright, I'm in level two.
[123:44.92]Guards.
[123:46.12]I...
[123:47.56]I couldn't hear anything from that cutscene because the blaring... Open the door!
[123:58.11]How do I turn the alarm off?
[124:09.97]I need the key.
[124:10.89]Leave the corpse.
[124:18.75]What is this?
[124:19.33]What kind of... What?
[124:23.37]A weird door.
[124:24.69]What?
[124:26.01]That's... Okay.
[124:35.55]Just in case shit hits the absolute fan, I have a save point back there.
[124:39.96]Alright, I need to find the map in the officer's quarters.
[124:43.98]Find the evidence locker.
[124:48.57]Evidence locker.
[124:54.09]Nothing in there.
[124:54.59]Alright, shit.
[124:55.29]Hold on.
[124:55.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[125:01.73]Why does the prison have door locks?
[125:05.01]I don't know, dude.
[125:06.25]Hey.
[125:08.54]What I need you to do, I need you to be a distraction.
[125:10.62]What I want you to do is I want you to scream really loud when I walk over this way so the guard will come over and I'll knock him out.
[125:22.14]He's dead?
[125:22.50]Hey.
[125:52.31]Excellent job.
[125:54.09]I was thinking about it.
[125:55.23]No, I can't like zoom out though.
[126:08.96]Where is he?
[126:17.10]Oh, don't do that.
[126:17.78]Don't scare me like that.
[126:18.57]You're pretending to hold a weapon.
[126:19.67]He's walking around holding a fake weapon.
[126:21.43]Get out of here.
[126:35.27]Alright, get out!
[126:39.29]Go for it!
[126:50.08]Let's get out of here!
[126:51.24]Everybody get out!
[126:52.68]Everybody get out!
[126:56.20]It's every man for himself!
[127:01.60]Where's the guard quarters?
[127:04.13]No, we can take him.
[127:07.08]We can take him.
[127:07.92]We can take him.
[127:30.81]I don't know why I did that.
[127:31.78]I just pressed it like an idiot.
[127:33.48]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[127:34.66]Where's the guard's quarters?
[127:35.64]Over here.
[127:43.08]You alright?
[127:45.18]You're smart.
[127:45.68]This is a smart one.
[127:51.29]You need a weapon, but you don't have a weapon.
[127:53.07]You don't have a weapon.
[127:54.75]You need to get away from me, though.
[127:56.53]You have to leave me alone.
[127:59.04]Yes, it's good to see you.
[128:00.82]Very nice to meet you.
[128:01.62]This guy, okay.
[128:05.69]Stay with me.
[128:06.25]Ooh, stay with me.
[128:21.97]What?
[128:24.22]I just let him out of prison.
[128:25.28]I just broke him out of prison and he's screaming assassin?
[128:32.50]I'm sorry, that was fucked up.
[128:39.18]Alright, where... I gotta... Barracks and officers' quarters.
[128:45.86]Wait, what?
[128:53.23]I can write on this?
[129:08.72]Okay.
[129:11.34]I gotta head this way.
[129:17.04]So I have to go down.
[129:17.90]And then across.
[129:20.36]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[129:21.40]I need to drink a health potion though.
[129:28.01]Officer's quarters.
[129:28.99]Officer's cell block one.
[129:30.47]Officer's quarters.
[129:36.49]Alright, cell block one, which is across the way.
[129:40.03]Link, can I just... The Builder shall guide me to thee!
[129:48.80]Can you go through this door?
[129:59.87]Who is there?
[130:01.23]Is someone there?
[130:10.82]Alright, cell block three.
[130:12.02]I gotta get to cell block one.
[130:15.32]Cell block one was on the other side.
[130:17.39]Oh, shit.
[130:22.01]And how?
[130:22.69]Explain to me how you saw me, you piece of crap.
[130:46.97]Don't hit your head on the ceiling!
[130:48.14]Ugh!
[130:50.48]Cell block 1-1-1-1-1-1-1.
[131:01.65]Leave me the fuck alone!
[131:05.31]Leave me alone!
[131:05.97]This guy chased me the- What's the aggro range?
[131:07.69]Leave me- Get away from me!
[131:09.27]Leave me alone!
[131:17.01]This guy is seriously a superhero.
[131:19.09]Get away from me.
[131:19.99]Why would I even start-
[131:59.62]I know where to go.
[132:00.04]Do no motion?
[132:03.82]Is this a stream sniper?
[132:34.78]No emotion?
[132:35.38]Should I do no emotion?
[132:36.18]I can't.
[132:36.46]I'm just trying to concentrate.
[132:37.48]This game's hard.
[132:39.08]Stop singing.
[132:39.80]Why does everybody sing?
[132:40.54]Alright, here we go.
[132:45.53]I don't have somebody chasing me now.
[132:46.75]I can get to cell block one from here.
[132:48.35]This is a scary game.
[132:55.09]It's kind of scary.
[132:56.47]Alright, here we go.
[132:58.79]Get through this.
[133:02.45]Wait till it turns off.
[133:05.56]You got like a two second window.
[133:07.10]One.
[133:07.24]Did you see that bait?
[133:09.60]What was that?
[133:12.98]Okay.
[133:14.53]Oh my goodness.
[133:15.33]I'm fine.
[133:16.71]Alright.
[133:17.37]Save it right here.
[133:18.41]Drink a health potion.
[133:19.21]I'm ready to go.
[133:21.57]You just heard me gulp that.
[133:23.45]You just heard me drink.
[133:26.83]You gotta be kidding me.
[133:35.52]That would be so scary.
[133:39.01]If you're just in like a pitch black area.
[133:42.31]And all you hear is this.
[133:51.53]Okay, save it here.
[134:00.06]So I'll block one.
[134:02.56]Into the barracks.
[134:08.98]Alright, no more alarm.
[134:14.81]Finally.
[134:17.41]I can take this guy out.
[134:19.31]What happened?
[134:19.73]What's going on?
[134:20.57]What?
[134:20.85]Did he just turn the alarm back on?
[134:26.36]I think he just got himself stuck.
[134:39.94]Alright, we're good.
[134:42.18]Cell block one is this way.
[134:49.97]Crank this over here so nobody hears it.
[134:56.37]Okay.
[134:58.27]I gotta go get the map.
[135:03.34]Okay.
[135:07.65]Okay.
[135:08.47]Up here, barracks, offices, quarters, straight ahead.
[135:11.87]I just have to sneak through with the shadows.
[135:17.43]Let's have a good bad gamer neck there for a second.
[135:30.99]Okay.
[135:37.42]Here we go.
[135:42.68]The barracks.
[135:43.22]Give it again.
[135:57.61]Alright, where are we at?
[136:04.04]Is it in here?
[136:04.80]Oh, carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet.
[136:06.68]Good.
[136:07.80]I didn't want to pick this.
[136:22.23]I'm not hidden.
[136:23.33]Who's that?
[136:24.11]Who's that?
[136:24.67]Was that a prince?
[136:30.33]Who was that guy?
[136:35.89]Got anything on you?
[136:38.27]Oh shit, nice.
[136:39.19]There's tons of stuff in here.
[136:41.21]Nothing?
[136:41.45]Alright.
[136:41.95]These are all the guard's quarters.
[137:07.82]Knife.
[137:12.44]Alright.
[137:44.78]Looking for the map now.
[137:46.88]Wherever that is.
[137:47.52]Hold on.
[137:48.06]I came in through here.
[137:54.30]How do I not have full health after eating all that?
[137:55.94]Alright.
[137:59.28]I explored all the quarters.
[138:04.20]Here we go.
[138:04.86]I don't know who this person was.
[138:12.03]I'm coming.
[138:18.69]I'm gonna throw the knife at his neck.
[138:21.03]Can I think I can hit it from here?
[138:21.85]Nope, but it don't matter.
[138:28.21]I'll get him.
[138:31.81]What?
[138:37.97]He just like baited me, but I still hit him in the head.
[138:39.61]Okay.
[138:49.83]I don't even know who this person is.
[138:50.93]Does he have like a key or something?
[138:52.95]It doesn't look like it.
[138:56.93]He's throwing a handle first.
[138:58.43]It's not gonna kill anybody.
[139:11.64]Somebody walking?
[139:21.10]Alright, where's this map?
[139:24.04]Find the evidence locker in the tree- evidence locker in the- am I going too far?
[139:28.51]This guy's got magical powers?
[139:36.58]Thinkest thou that harmed me?
[139:39.20]Thy arm must be stronger to touch me.
[139:41.72]My armor is proof against the light of thee.
[139:44.26]Thinkest thou that harmed me?
[139:47.04]My armor is proof against the light of thee.
[139:49.74]Thy arm must be stronger to touch me.
[139:52.13]Ring thinkest thou thou?
[139:54.67]There's a lot of talking, but he's got magic powers.
[139:57.25]Is this a spell book?
[140:07.21]When I was cold, thou taught of hearth and roof beam.
[140:10.51]When I was hungry, thou taught of pot and cauldron.
[140:13.40]When I was beset by foes, thou taught of spear and shield.
[140:17.01]Thy hammer pounds thy nail, holds the roof beam.
[140:20.57]Thy hammer strikes the iron, shapes the cauldron.
[140:22.87]Thy hammer in my hand, unto my foes.
[140:27.84]I think I had fire powers.
[140:29.08]Are these magic potions?
[140:34.98]Okay.
[140:37.23]Wait a minute.
[140:39.15]Do I need to bring a hammer here?
[140:42.15]In front of the door?
[140:52.19]I hope not.
[140:55.69]Still walking around here.
[140:57.03]Hopefully I'm about to get to the next part.
[140:58.53]What are these hammers?
[141:17.88]Oh, I found a hammer.
[141:19.08]What?
[141:24.02]Holy shit, diamonds.
[141:27.63]Oh, I got it!
[141:48.84]Alright.
[141:50.94]I got it.
[141:51.52]It was right there.
[141:55.93]Alright.
[141:57.07]I couldn't save Cuddy.
[141:58.19]I think that's scripted though.
[142:01.21]That was loud.
[142:18.11]And the man fools piled rock on rocks and raised to treasy roof.
[142:24.49]Hammer saws tear the skin of goodsy wood and laughs at the woodsy lord.
[142:32.04]And when learns of the lord of this, he sends his beasties to the man fools who attacks and hammer saws their useless flesh and build him a house of thy rotting skins.
[142:48.57]I was pissed at Cuddy for a good while after the prison debacle.
[142:53.03]But hey, you can't blame him for what the hammers did to him.
[142:56.26]So I decided to go after that horn Felix talked about.
[143:00.32]Not like I had a whole lot of choice, really.
[143:02.66]The rent is due.
[143:04.26]My landlord's even talking about the hammers.
[143:07.39]The map's pretty specific about where the entrance is.
[143:10.57]Too bad it's not as clear about where the horn is.
[143:14.17]Great.
[143:14.57]Filthy men thing.
[143:42.27]Uh, should I go pee?
[143:43.43]Should we take a pee break?
[143:45.63]Search through the ancient bone horde and procure the legendary horn of Quintus.
[143:52.20]Let me just get a good save point here.
[143:53.32]Oh, wait, let me spend some money.
[143:57.92]These are pretty useful, so I want some.
[144:02.51]That's way too expensive.
[144:04.15]Never mind, I'd rather have the alarm get set off than spend that much money.
[144:09.55]Water arrows.
[144:10.77]Fifty...
[144:12.46]Rope arrows, okay.
[144:15.70]I want health.
[144:17.02]It's so much more important to me.
[144:19.34]Holy water.
[144:20.02]This vial of hammer-sanctified liquid is potent protection against the undead when used on your water arrows.
[144:25.98]I have a few of them.
[144:29.28]Maybe I'll get more of these, yeah.
[144:34.16]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[144:37.95]The money's about previous missions.
[144:39.21]That's pretty cool.
[144:41.48]This game's fun.
[144:41.90]I like this game.
[144:48.80]I'm going to save it right here.
[144:49.62]I'm going to take a quick pee break.
[144:53.82]I'll be right back.
[144:57.18]You know, I know it's like January 10th or whatever.
[145:02.84]How about the Christmas one one more time?
[145:04.00]What do you think?
[145:05.52]Christmas one one more time?
[145:10.14]Yeah.
[145:11.04]Yeah, oh yeah.
[145:12.46]Yeah.
[145:13.14]Alright.
[145:14.28]I'll see you guys in two minutes.
[145:15.42]I'm just gonna go pee real quick.
[145:17.42]Grab some water.
[145:18.62]See you guys in a minute.
[145:32.55]Oops.
[145:33.33]Alright, we're good.
[145:34.33]Beer beat.
[147:33.18]Thank you.
[149:38.49]Thank you.
[150:14.87]I have returned.
[150:21.16]How are you doing?
[150:24.18]Are you a Raiders fan ever since you went to Vegas?
[150:27.86]Um, I never really was a football fan to begin with, but I think it's cool.
[150:36.16]I really kind of feel bad for, uh, for Oakland though.
[150:40.44]Because Vegas took the Raiders, and Vegas might take the A's too.
[150:47.75]So, that's kind of... I feel bad for Oakland.
[150:55.73]Oh, we're doing sports talk now.
[151:06.31]This is a prime 90s PC boomer game.
[151:08.69]How did you not play it yet?
[151:10.75]I'm telling you, it's been installed for like years.
[151:16.34]I just had to decide on a day to do it.
[151:19.70]And I just put it in the poll.
[151:20.92]Alright, let's do it.
[151:26.78]Did you wash your hands?
[151:27.58]I always wash my hands.
[151:28.59]Always.
[151:30.67]Always.
[151:37.59]Are you gonna do Thief 2 and Thief 3 as well?
[151:39.91]I don't know.
[151:42.23]That's actually a pretty good question.
[151:43.39]It really depends on how much I enjoy this one.
[151:45.29]Which, so far, I think it's pretty fun.
[151:46.49]Getting the scary music back up.
[151:53.75]Back to this.
[152:00.04]Thief 2 is this, but better.
[152:02.40]Okay.
[152:04.28]Okay.
[152:05.89]Reboot is trash.
[152:06.79]Don't play it.
[152:08.61]I kind of wanted to play this one anyways.
[152:14.41]Add it to the list of old PC boomer games.
[152:16.31]That's right.
[152:16.85]Facecam or Outrage.
[152:18.17]Wait a minute.
[152:27.05]There.
[152:29.43]Alright, so this one, what are we going to do?
[152:32.42]Find the horn of Quintus.
[152:35.06]That's all the info I got and I have nothing else to go on.
[152:37.85]This guy's gonna get up.
[152:39.57]Yep.
[152:41.27]Who cares though?
[152:42.17]What?
[152:42.37]Do I really care?
[152:44.59]I'm just gonna go.
[152:46.01]Right?
[152:46.25]Like he's gonna... That was just a jump scare.
[152:48.61]That didn't happen.
[152:51.83]Kind of creepy.
[152:52.67]Alright.
[152:57.10]Do I have any notes?
[152:59.39]Mario Family, Halls of Echoing Repose, Hammerite Crips, Quintus Family.
[153:05.47]So we gotta go down.
[153:07.05]Down and north.
[153:12.37]I guess.
[153:12.67]Did he die from this?
[153:30.66]Watch it.
[153:33.26]Should I kill this thing with holy water?
[153:35.20]Probably, right?
[153:35.80]Fire!
[153:44.33]Fire!
[153:44.63]Anybody else?
[153:50.88]Quick, I only have 19 seconds.
[153:52.04]Anybody else down here?
[154:01.47]Oh, there's a goblet, though.
[154:02.63]Nice.
[154:03.01]Alright.
[154:06.78]Oh, shit!
[154:07.86]No!
[154:08.46]That's bad.
[154:09.52]I thought I was touching this.
[154:10.86]I have to reload.
[154:14.84]I thought I was... Okay.
[154:16.32]Sorry about that.
[154:16.86]Fucking idiot.
[154:36.83]Alright, here we go.
[154:37.66]Third time's a charm.
[154:46.10]Shoot the arrow, please.
[154:47.28]Okay.
[154:51.07]Anybody else down here?
[154:52.29]I don't think so.
[154:59.34]Fifteen seconds.
[155:00.04]Any other enemies?
[155:00.66]Come on.
[155:08.80]That's weird.
[155:10.98]Three seconds.
[155:12.28]Nothing.
[155:12.56]Alright.
[155:13.10]So I guess I'm just gonna keep going.
[155:19.83]Argyle wall?
[155:22.85]Alright.
[155:26.69]Diving board.
[155:27.27]What are your thoughts on... Alaris?
[155:43.14]Alaris.
[155:44.38]Does that mean anything?
[155:45.09]Alright, I'm still in the upper vault.
[156:02.54]Ooh.
[156:04.90]Very useful.
[156:05.52]Alright.
[156:06.24]I got 30 seconds now.
[156:07.02]I'm going to beat some monsters right here.
[156:09.35]Guaranteed.
[156:13.04]Wrap door, don't stand on that.
[156:27.32]Oh.
[156:29.26]I thought it was going to fall.
[156:45.97]Is this gonna be over my head?
[156:46.81]Alright, I got it.
[156:49.51]So, wait.
[156:50.57]Okay.
[156:54.67]Will this shoot over my head?
[156:55.69]It is.
[157:03.66]Okay.
[157:03.96]Is this just a depressing box?
[157:09.94]I think so.
[157:14.71]Okay, I thought it was gonna fall.
[157:18.95]Well, that's why I need the holy water.
[157:20.27]Gotta go back and get it.
[157:20.89]Because it's free.
[157:24.38]Alright, here we go.
[157:27.30]Save it.
[157:28.74]And... Alright!
[157:47.11]Well, I got you.
[157:47.79]Grab it.
[157:55.07]Alright.
[157:55.95]Nothing else in here?
[157:59.75]Why is the body exploding so funny?
[158:01.32]I don't know.
[158:01.68]It just is.
[158:02.08]Something about it.
[158:08.62]Uh, okay.
[158:10.98]Upper vaults north.
[158:12.02]Should I go down here?
[158:19.76]Or deeper into the crypts.
[158:21.05]What do you think?
[158:23.19]How is it not funny?
[158:24.09]I know, it just is.
[158:27.79]Is there any other holy water things over here?
[158:29.41]These are both going to get up.
[158:31.71]Guaranteed.
[158:36.73]Let me just see if this... There might be a well right here.
[158:39.35]No, there's not.
[158:39.81]Alright, well... Do I need to kill these things or can I just run away?
[158:46.00]Yeah, there's no reason to.
[158:47.14]Just leave.
[158:48.38]Just leave, alright?
[158:48.86]Let's go in here.
[158:54.96]Neck light?
[158:57.72]What?
[158:57.84]What do you mean neck light?
[159:02.79]Have I ever worn an apron before?
[159:05.91]Maybe when I was barbecuing.
[159:07.71]I was probably barbecuing somewhere thinking I was funny.
[159:12.15]Like, oh, here I am, the chef!
[159:14.38]Nobody wants to be that guy, by the way.
[159:17.30]You know how much panic I have if I ever am the guy that is in charge of the grill?
[159:23.10]The whole time I'm just like... Everyone's gonna get poisoned.
[159:30.39]Is that cooked enough?
[159:31.19]I'm gonna kill somebody.
[159:36.11]Is that too red in the middle?
[159:36.83]Someone's gonna die.
[159:37.65]Someone's gonna die.
[159:38.55]Someone's gonna get too sick.
[159:39.59]No, just make... And then I overcook everything.
[159:41.65]I have to kill this guy.
[159:50.11]That's raw.
[159:51.26]Those chicken wings are raw.
[159:52.14]I can't serve them.
[159:54.20]And then I always, if I'm ever in charge of... Anytime you cook anything, I always want to eat it first.
[160:01.80]I'm going to be my own tester for my own food, right?
[160:05.69]You missed?
[160:10.23]The food's not ready yet.
[160:12.47]Hey, when do you think the food's going to be ready?
[160:13.85]Well... Maybe 20 minutes?
[160:18.88]We'll see.
[160:20.39]Because if I get sick, then I know, right?
[160:27.83]So nobody eat it.
[160:32.30]What was even in here?
[160:36.80]You just ate raw food.
[160:38.18]No, I'm just saying.
[160:39.24]I always want to make sure I don't make anybody sick or anything.
[160:42.96]And it can be really... Where am I?
[160:47.80]Wait, did I just go in a circle?
[160:51.11]Whenever you're the guy at the grill and you have like 15 hamburger patties on there, it can be, I don't know, it's, you can't really focus on one patty.
[161:01.61]So you have to really make sure that everything is cooked correctly and everything's... Why are you guys saying neck light?
[161:12.46]I don't get this.
[161:13.28]What are you doing?
[161:15.72]Back in the water?
[161:19.82]Put the light on your neck.
[161:21.49]It's not gonna fit.
[161:25.65]Okay, no, no, I gotta go back down.
[161:36.01]No, you guys are gonna- this is gonna turn into a cartoon.
[161:42.82]This way?
[161:44.10]Do I have enough breath to do this?
[161:51.25]Where's this taking me?
[161:53.40]It'll fit, trust me, I'm an engineer.
[162:01.14]Where the f*** am I going?
[162:10.31]Leave it open so you know where you've been!
[162:11.57]Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[162:14.35]Alright, I went right and down, so now I'm just gonna go over?
[162:25.11]Why do I hear sleigh bells?
[162:38.20]This is kinda creepy.
[162:39.52]Oh, wait, I see.
[162:40.38]I see the cannon.
[162:42.79]Yeah, you think you're so funny.
[162:45.15]Nope.
[162:46.25]Sorry.
[162:55.66]I think I just drank all my potions.
[162:56.66]No, I didn't.
[163:03.41]Okay, so how do I get through here?
[163:09.15]You promised all of them.
[163:10.01]Because I did it in the very beginning of the stream and it was stupid.
[163:12.32]I couldn't even get three on my hand.
[163:29.16]Alright, we're going down to wherever like... I guess we're going down here.
[163:54.90]Oh, don't touch that.
[163:56.12]Right?
[163:57.58]Is this going to do something if I touch it?
[164:02.42]This looks lower, right?
[164:03.38]There's a lip here.
[164:04.34]Does that mean anything?
[164:04.94]Probably not.
[164:08.32]Mushrooms.
[164:13.32]Can't pick them up.
[164:15.87]This feels like Castle Griffinstein.
[164:35.20]What is that thing?
[164:37.46]What is that thing?
[164:38.52]I gotta try to drop this on his head.
[164:43.33]Come by again.
[164:50.87]Does this even- Can you even hurt enemies with this stuff?
[165:09.52]I don't like those sounds.
[165:21.25]No, no, no.
[165:21.69]Get me back up.
[165:22.13]I'm fine.
[165:22.41]Relax.
[165:22.63]Shut up.
[165:34.50]Does this hurt?
[165:35.02]This looks like one of those guys in those inflatable T-Rex costumes.
[165:57.94]It's like a pig and a...
[166:06.79]I don't wanna hurt it!
[166:07.69]I don't- I wish I could just say, I'm not gonna hurt you.
[166:10.35]But, it's not gonna let me pass.
[166:21.42]Duck!
[166:24.42]Jump!
[166:35.66]I'm sorry, I had to.
[166:38.39]It's because you threw a boulder at it.
[166:39.95]I don't know.
[166:40.47]It was trying to get me.
[166:51.33]I'm coloring a cat coloring book.
[166:53.42]What's your favorite cat?
[166:55.42]Um, I don't know.
[166:56.34]Cats are cool.
[167:02.46]Oh, shit.
[167:03.38]Here comes the whole family.
[167:06.67]Mmm, okay.
[167:08.73]Where am I?
[167:13.45]Why is there a little arrow scratched over here?
[167:15.17]What?
[167:21.24]I'm gonna follow the arrow.
[167:27.18]I'm kind of scared to do this.
[167:28.04]Okay.
[167:50.93]Okay.
[167:51.77]I think I made it.
[167:52.37]Is this it?
[167:58.63]Watch out.
[167:59.09]There's all these things everywhere.
[168:00.15]Be careful.
[168:04.71]If I crouch, it's fine, right?
[168:08.52]Yeah.
[168:08.84]Just stay crouched.
[168:11.58]Ah!
[168:11.76]The back... Boom!
[168:16.48]It's dead.
[168:17.28]Right in the back of the head.
[168:26.16]Don't push that down.
[168:27.18]Alright, we got cheese.
[168:29.62]Excuse me?
[168:30.64]What?
[168:30.96]Oh, he's right.
[168:38.49]Bedroll?
[168:49.07]What's this stuff?
[168:50.12]Is it dinosaur teeth or something?
[168:51.18]What are those?
[169:00.37]Speed potion.
[169:02.85]Fire arrows.
[169:03.90]Oh, nice.
[169:04.36]Alright.
[169:04.98]Cool.
[169:05.98]Alright, be careful here getting out.
[169:30.56]Alright, nice.
[169:33.71]That got me that, so now I gotta go the other way, right?
[169:36.13]Yeah.
[169:36.31]Can you throw up on stream, chat?
[169:38.99]No, I'm not gonna throw up on stream.
[169:40.17]Haha, vomit's all over the place.
[169:41.39]Glad you thought it was funny.
[169:52.28]Okay, so now I got... I gotta take these... I gotta change pants.
[170:08.62]I don't understand the concept here of, like, climbing.
[170:10.48]I think you just have to hold it.
[170:11.50]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[170:22.64]All over the place here.
[170:23.70]Where, yeah, where am I actually going?
[170:25.42]Down, okay.
[170:38.32]There's dinosaurs down here.
[170:39.42]I don't want... I want to try to avoid them if I can.
[170:42.89]Fire arrows on the dinosaurs?
[170:49.23]Try it.
[170:57.26]Wait, did I kill that?
[170:58.20]No, I didn't.
[171:13.26]Where am I supposed to go here?
[171:17.02]Let's go up.
[171:26.65]They're not gonna get up, right?
[171:27.41]They're dead.
[171:28.13]There we go.
[171:42.40]This is such a maze.
[171:43.34]I hear it.
[172:16.84]Ooh.
[172:18.06]That's it?
[172:19.84]Are you kidding me?
[172:20.60]That's it?
[172:26.71]Why are you so mad?
[172:27.69]I'm not.
[172:31.69]Eat the shrooms?
[172:32.27]I think they're just light shrooms.
[172:33.62]I don't think they're actual shroom shrooms.
[172:35.28]I don't think I can eat them.
[172:35.92]I gotta turn this up.
[172:41.78]People saying, follow the music.
[172:56.78]That was a pig.
[172:57.62]That was clearly a pig.
[172:59.18]That was that... You know that pig sound?
[173:02.56]The default pig sound?
[173:03.60]Alright, up here...
[173:24.14]That's why I don't put the two goddamn headphones in!
[173:29.39]Get up!
[173:33.91]Climb up here!
[173:35.19]Oh, now I'm back here.
[173:38.83]Alright, get away from me.
[173:51.43]Shit.
[173:53.03]Shit.
[173:57.23]Oh my... Oh!
[174:03.44]Oh!
[174:03.74]Oh!
[174:13.17]Get away from me.
[174:14.63]I'm gonna die.
[174:15.33]I'm gonna die.
[174:17.41]I'm gonna die.
[174:18.99]You gotta be... How did he get up here?
[174:21.07]How did they get up here?
[174:21.77]They can't get up here.
[174:24.13]I missed again.
[174:24.78]I missed again and went all the way to the back.
[174:27.24]I'm gonna die right now.
[174:38.67]I can't believe that just happened.
[174:40.21]I can't believe it.
[174:45.15]You've got to be kidding me.
[174:46.11]I don't even know where the save is.
[174:49.48]Not that bad.
[174:51.84]How did it miss?
[174:52.96]There were three in all my field of vision.
[174:56.44]That's so unfortunate.
[175:03.81]Oh well.
[175:12.45]I got so much on my mouth.
[175:16.97]Go change your pants.
[175:17.75]That'll be alright.
[175:18.60]That's a worst gamer moment.
[175:20.44]I mean, that was bad.
[175:21.92]But that wasn't even my fault, though.
[175:23.20]That was such bullshit.
[175:26.48]You saw.
[175:27.20]The hitbox got weird.
[175:28.70]It just missed.
[175:30.42]And I don't even know how it missed.
[175:31.54]I don't even know where I am right now.
[175:34.12]But I'm just going to grab onto this and go up.
[175:35.97]And I think I just found it accidentally.
[175:42.37]Did I just find it?
[175:47.06]I just found where I need to go.
[175:48.00]No, I didn't.
[175:54.32]Is he still alive?
[175:57.26]There's a sick McDonald's ceiling.
[176:08.52]It's like not even close.
[176:10.30]I mean, it's kind of close, but not really.
[176:12.90]Not enough for you to say that.
[176:15.68]I don't think there's anything here.
[176:24.35]Alright, I gotta get through that.
[176:25.45]There's nothing else here I can do.
[176:29.17]Can I take something?
[176:30.25]Push something?
[176:30.79]No.
[176:33.00]Secret.
[176:36.44]It returns into the Joker.
[176:45.99]Wait a minute.
[177:03.24]on monsters that good to know very good to know that the the little bludgeoner works on huge monsters alright time to get turned around a million times again follow the music I feel like I was on the right track
[177:35.39]It works on anything that's alive.
[177:37.91]Okay, good to know.
[177:38.77]That's funny.
[177:41.86]Yep, I remember getting the jewel here.
[177:48.58]All the music.
[177:51.38]Put in both headphones.
[177:52.34]I hate doing that.
[177:54.72]I hate it.
[177:55.24]I don't like it.
[177:57.76]It's too immersive.
[178:18.23]What's wrong with being immersed?
[178:19.30]I'm not aware of my Saronics.
[178:33.47]I don't hear any music.
[178:34.55]Alright, I gotta start burning this into memory here.
[178:36.59]Fodwatches, skip.
[178:40.49]Don't skip.
[178:41.55]You need to help me.
[178:46.87]I hear the music now.
[178:59.57]Okay.
[178:59.67]This is where I got messed up last time.
[179:05.03]Did I just burp?
[179:16.54]Oh, I thought that was me.
[179:20.44]Shut up!
[179:20.98]Shut up!
[179:21.48]Shut up!
[179:21.98]Shut up!
[179:22.62]Shut up!
[179:27.25]Music.
[179:27.57]Music.
[179:28.93]Music.
[179:31.74]Come on, get up there.
[179:32.58]How do I get that?
[179:43.48]Why is it saying go down?
[180:03.91]Oh!
[180:12.55]Um... We're there?
[180:15.01]Do I have a rope arrow over there?
[180:24.91]Music's in this room.
[180:30.77]These zombies or these people?
[180:31.93]It's hard to tell.
[180:57.23]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[180:59.47]Golden arm!
[181:00.71]Golden arm!
[181:04.96]Alright, how do I get out?
[181:10.82]I got a golden ar- How do I get out?
[181:23.63]How do I get out?
[181:24.01]How do I get out?
[181:26.81]Oh!
[181:59.19]Eat him, not me.
[182:00.01]Eat him.
[182:01.39]Eat him, not me.
[182:02.29]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[182:05.85]The horn is somewhere down here.
[182:08.51]Oh my god, I'm actually in the horn room.
[182:13.00]Need to heal.
[182:14.72]Golden arm.
[182:26.64]I was just frozen in fear.
[182:35.65]I couldn't do anything.
[182:36.37]I was just frozen.
[182:43.41]No!
[182:51.31]I can't.
[183:01.89]Shut up, everybody.
[183:02.97]Alright, let's go, bro.
[183:16.88]Ah!
[183:17.94]No, I'm trapped!
[183:19.44]I'm trapped!
[183:24.67]Okay, fuck this.
[183:25.45]I'm outta here.
[183:26.45]I'm just gonna bunny hop through the whole thing.
[183:36.83]What's in here?
[183:37.21]What's in here?
[183:37.57]What's in here?
[183:37.93]Oh, I got it.
[183:38.51]I got it.
[183:38.73]I got it.
[183:38.99]I'm good.
[183:59.83]He sucks.
[184:00.39]I... Another golden arm.
[184:04.31]Never mind.
[184:12.84]I keep hearing the horn.
[184:13.82]I'm gonna go up.
[184:20.66]Stop fucking breathing in my ear.
[184:22.88]It's like ASMR.
[184:24.00]Leave me the fuck alone.
[184:28.39]He takes a sip and then he goes, Why would you jump off?
[184:57.87]I don't like this level.
[184:58.79]I really don't.
[185:00.11]I don't like this level.
[185:01.09]I'm trying to jump onto the stupid platforms over there.
[185:05.11]Oh my... Oh, freak.
[185:07.03]Oh my freaking god.
[185:10.75]Why would I jump off?
[185:11.61]I'm not jumping off.
[185:12.77]I'm trying to get off the ladder.
[185:14.15]I can't just walk forward.
[185:15.31]I have to jump.
[185:17.06]Like that.
[185:17.52]I'm holding on for dear life.
[185:21.72]What do I do?
[185:22.18]Do I let go of space?
[185:23.24]Should I let go of space?
[185:24.06]I think if I let go of space, I hold myself up, right?
[185:47.93]Weird dinosaur raptor guard.
[185:49.59]Alright.
[185:57.44]Pig noise.
[186:11.04]Whoa!
[186:27.42]Got him!
[186:36.93]Did I find- I found a door.
[186:38.51]I got a door.
[186:38.93]Dude.
[186:44.16]Ow, my head.
[186:44.92]Uh oh.
[186:47.24]I can't open this.
[186:54.08]Come on.
[187:01.44]So what am I doing up here?
[187:02.42]Shit.
[187:13.57]Clean your face, you're a little bit sweaty.
[187:18.19]This way?
[187:20.94]I only have two earbuds in so I can tell where this horn is.
[187:24.35]The game is too dark.
[187:35.37]It's dark, I know.
[187:35.95]I'm trying to make it brighter.
[187:39.98]By the way, why is it doing this?
[187:48.00]It is dark, isn't it?
[187:48.71]I don't know why it's so dark.
[187:58.04]Is that better?
[188:02.28]Better?
[188:10.07]That's better, yeah.
[188:11.47]It's meant to be dark.
[188:12.33]I know, but, like, we're... Come on, we're gamers.
[188:14.49]We're streamers.
[188:14.95]I want to be able to see.
[188:15.55]Alright, honest to god, I'm... I think I have to go back down.
[188:22.55]Wait.
[188:23.49]No, I don't.
[188:26.87]Check this shit out.
[188:30.30]We're gonna Donkey Kong Country this shit right now.
[188:31.86]Where's the rope?
[188:35.38]Where's the rope?
[188:44.01]Rope arrow.
[188:53.34]This doesn't work?
[188:54.74]It only- it doesn't- I- I'm gonna reload then because that sucks.
[189:07.75]It only works on wood.
[189:09.01]Oh, that's annoying.
[189:12.51]That's annoying.
[189:13.00]Alright, I gotta go back down.
[189:16.68]Get the arrows ready.
[189:38.47]Go down the ladder.
[189:57.16]What is all this?
[189:57.94]Hold on.
[189:59.31]Ladder right there, too.
[190:00.19]Trinkets?
[190:03.39]Nope.
[190:03.59]Probably a trinket up here.
[190:10.87]What's the point of this?
[190:12.73]It can't just be for no reason.
[190:13.99]It has to be a point to do this, right?
[190:15.63]What's the point?
[190:21.06]For realism?
[190:23.06]To avoid enemies.
[190:48.78]Hey!
[190:50.88]Hey!
[190:51.28]Somebody's shooting arrows at me.
[190:52.82]Who's shooting arrows?
[190:56.91]I hear arrows firing at me.
[190:58.35]I don't know from what direction.
[191:05.99]Don't go down there.
[191:20.73]Okay, they're going around in a circle.
[191:32.32]Oh!
[191:46.38]Wait, what did I do that for?
[191:47.08]This is a giant circle.
[191:49.86]What do I do?
[191:52.45]Wait, hold on.
[191:54.03]Here we go.
[192:03.51]Ah, this place is so confusing.
[192:04.81]This place is so confusing.
[192:05.81]Can I go over here?
[192:08.79]The music's getting louder.
[193:02.27]I'm trying to just fucking run by him.
[193:12.02]What's that say?
[193:13.74]Quintus!
[193:14.98]I made it, I made it, I made it.
[193:15.80]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[193:25.79]Safe.
[193:25.93]Be quiet, my mother's trying to sleep.
[193:27.59]Turn my volume down.
[193:29.47]Turn me down.
[193:31.35]Good thing I'm not afraid of heights.
[193:33.37]I was trying to- whatever.
[193:37.41]Okay, I can take this out now.
[193:40.65]I was trying to match the guy's speech.
[193:47.15]Climb the ladder, you dumb!
[193:57.04]Get the holy water ready.
[194:07.94]Okay, we're fine.
[194:08.40]I knew it was going to happen.
[194:14.15]It's so wonky to jump off the ladder.
[194:15.71]Why is beard Jerma so mean?
[194:21.15]I'm not mean.
[194:22.43]What are you talking about?
[194:23.13]I'm just chilling around.
[194:28.69]I'm right there.
[194:29.13]Just do it.
[194:36.24]Is there ever a game that's gotten ladders right?
[194:53.85]Um.
[194:55.54]Dark Souls.
[194:57.24]Dark Souls ladders were fine.
[194:59.58]Because you didn't have to kind of first person stick on them.
[195:03.70]Here we go.
[195:05.28]You actually climbed them.
[195:08.37]So your character was just on it, but in FPS where you have to attach to a ladder and get off of a ladder, I don't think it's possible to make that good.
[195:17.03]I don't.
[195:22.95]It's such an awkward movement just by def- Wait, you can snipe me from down there?
[195:40.78]There it is.
[195:59.19]Go up!
[196:00.47]Thank you.
[196:00.89]Oh, the horn.
[196:04.29]Now what?
[196:04.91]Did I win?
[196:16.29]Find the Horn of Quintus.
[196:17.47]Got it.
[196:27.22]The ancient corruption was again contained.
[196:29.66]To do more would have upset the balance, but we knew to remain ever vigilant lest it resurface.
[196:39.82]Neither the Hammers nor the Pagans could be trusted not to meddle.
[196:46.62]Keeper annals.
[196:48.56]I had some money to spare after disposing of the horn, so it seemed time to invest in some new tools.
[196:55.49]Farkas.
[196:56.01]Farkas is one of the few merchants willing to risk selling to an independent like me, and his prices are steep.
[197:01.63]But the other choice is to let one of the so-called wardens give me orders and take a cut of my profits.
[197:08.46]They've been after me for years to join one of their stables, but I'm not interested.
[197:12.95]Where are we going now?
[197:13.49]Now that you've got the finest in lockpicks, you can go after more challenging and lucrative targets.
[197:19.15]How about the local Hammer Temple?
[197:20.31]Get at least a thousand loot.
[197:22.57]Okay.
[197:41.62]Cool.
[197:42.32]So I got lockpicks.
[197:44.26]Gonna steal a bunch of loot.
[197:45.52]I got a lot of money.
[197:48.76]The fire arrows are explosions.
[197:50.44]They're so loud and annoying.
[197:55.14]I want at least a couple health potions.
[197:56.42]Should I take more moss?
[198:03.14]I don't use them though.
[198:05.29]Playing on normal.
[198:06.15]Yeah, I'm a normal gamer.
[198:11.28]The water arrows, maybe I'll take a couple.
[198:13.90]They're expensive, though.
[198:19.36]Fine, I'll take one fire arrow, and then a moss arrow, and then just more of these.
[198:25.72]Sure, alright, sounds good.
[198:28.68]Okay, here we go.
[198:29.22]Let me save it.
[198:32.81]I'll get back here for you guys.
[198:33.95]Save the game.
[198:35.85]A hard save slot.
[198:38.17]Okay.
[198:39.09]How are we?
[198:41.59]What?
[198:42.09]Oh my god.
[198:42.71]Free stuff.
[198:46.15]Why did I buy anything?
[198:47.85]Why did I buy anything?
[198:51.09]This is all free.
[198:51.81]Oh my goodness.
[198:52.34]Holy.
[198:52.76]That's a lot of stuff.
[199:14.12]Okay, what about this?
[199:16.53]Anything else in here?
[199:22.75]Alright, so now I gotta... Trail the thugs who just tried to assassinate you without being detected.
[199:32.40]Where'd they go?
[199:32.88]I don't know where the hell they are.
[199:47.26]Where, I don't know, where are they?
[199:55.51]In here?
[199:55.79]I don't, I don't know.
[200:06.14]I was busy stealing everything.
[200:07.56]Oh.
[200:08.02]Well, I'll find them.
[200:13.36]They down here?
[200:16.35]Oh, they came down here.
[200:21.16]What happened to me?
[200:21.62]Did I just, like... I die?
[200:24.06]Oh, I thought I got, like, fucking, like, close to the giant trap and it instantly killed me.
[200:30.97]I thought, like, I got sniped or something.
[200:32.55]Alright.
[200:34.05]Um... So I need to open up that hard save, then.
[200:41.25]Hold on.
[200:47.72]Oh, what are you doing you idiot?
[200:49.90]Alright, I gotta go quick That shot was meant for me
[201:17.20]Is that Microsoft network noises?
[201:21.41]Alright, stay silent.
[201:22.07]Stay quiet.
[201:22.37]MSN sounds?
[201:22.79]MSN chat.
[201:48.68]That's so stupid.
[201:59.14]I'm fine.
[201:59.89]Whatever.
[202:01.85]No, you.
[202:04.61]I don't want to watch this guy die again.
[202:05.77]Alright, go, go, go.
[202:06.43]You dumb.
[202:06.73]I was reading chat.
[202:07.45]Sorry.
[202:24.76]Hail them.
[202:27.16]If explosion arrow is ready.
[202:29.74]Explosion arrow is at the ready.
[202:44.65]We'll teach him to mess with us!
[202:48.52]Funny.
[202:49.43]Funny joke!
[202:52.07]He was doing the same... No one is following you.
[203:11.24]Relax.
[203:20.47]Where'd they go?
[203:21.59]Where'd they go?
[203:21.93]Where'd they go?
[203:22.35]Where'd they go?
[203:22.95]Where'd they go?
[203:23.71]Where'd they go?
[203:24.09]Where'd they go?
[203:24.55]Where'd they go?
[203:26.17]Where'd they go?
[203:26.63]I didn't see where they went!
[203:49.02]Wait!
[203:49.30]Moss arrows!
[203:53.55]Happening.
[204:17.75]SHIT!
[204:18.18]Where'd they go?
[204:53.82]We're just going in a big circle.
[205:14.76]It's going to be loud.
[205:15.36]Moss arrows.
[205:22.42]Someone behind us.
[205:31.61]Just the wind, I guess.
[205:57.58]Why do they keep stopping?
[206:01.96]He's having an allergic reaction to the game?
[206:04.09]What are you talking about?
[206:13.50]Hey, just spirit.
[206:14.36]Where did they go?
[206:15.24]What?
[206:15.42]Oh, over here.
[206:39.95]Ah, you can't see if it's dark.
[206:41.92]Idiot.
[206:42.24]How?
[206:57.05]This is... I'm gonna... This is long.
[207:00.61]This is really... Okay.
[207:12.93]Where are they gonna put the poor saps they grab?
[207:17.04]His ass is too big.
[207:18.56]Sir?
[207:48.09]Pick his body up.
[207:49.09]What are you thinking?
[207:50.35]Pick his body up and throw him over here.
[207:51.57]Alright, I'm in.
[208:02.00]Hey, I think I saw something over here.
[208:04.92]Hello?
[208:09.77]Anyone there?
[208:14.58]Hey!
[208:17.20]These soft- these are soft sounds, right?
[208:32.32]That's pitch black right here!
[208:37.68]What do I have?
[208:38.02]What's my mission?
[208:40.91]Time to show Ramirez who the real criminal mastermind is.
[208:44.20]Break into his mansion and take what he values most, his wealth.
[208:48.06]The purse from his belt should make the point.
[208:51.96]Loot the mansion.
[208:52.64]Alright.
[208:53.44]I just need to get a lot of money.
[208:56.51]Not going that way.
[209:08.52]Give me that key.
[209:14.40]This guy's got a key.
[209:20.11]Somebody coming?
[209:27.77]Oh shit.
[209:30.19]Oh shit!
[209:30.91]Don't go.
[209:31.45]Just wait.
[209:31.94]It's fine.
[209:38.85]It's not for this door.
[209:39.79]My eyes!
[209:51.96]I thought I was gonna throw it further.
[209:57.53]Come out, you!
[209:58.39]Where'd you come from?
[210:08.46]I have lockpicks?
[210:15.87]This doesn't work on this door.
[210:16.77]I have to get through here.
[210:18.89]I have to get through it.
[210:20.79]Try another shape.
[210:23.00]Come on.
[210:39.95]I want to be able to hide in here.
[210:47.81]Really?
[210:48.09]Ooh.
[210:51.75]Let's do the paintings.
[210:57.38]Is that the Danny DeVito guy from Hercules?
[211:04.50]Who is that?
[211:08.62]Come on.
[211:08.92]Something secret back here.
[211:15.97]Oh, wait.
[211:16.45]I do have other shapes.
[211:17.35]You're right.
[211:17.71]Alright.
[211:18.01]It's alright.
[211:23.11]What's up?
[211:53.66]Stop!
[211:54.14]You can't even see shit.
[211:55.56]Leave me alone.
[211:56.04]Can I take out the... Alright, I'm throwing a flashbang.
[212:15.59]Everybody close your eyes!
[212:16.43]Close your eyes!
[212:16.91]Close your eyes!
[212:17.37]Close your eyes!
[212:17.85]Close your eyes!
[212:34.62]I'm just not going over here.
[212:35.58]I'm going the other way.
[212:36.90]Stop seeing me.
[212:43.33]I'm going a different way.
[212:49.69]Those flashbangs are so bright.
[212:56.28]Fair warning.
[212:56.78]If I use those flashbangs, they're going to be horrible.
[212:58.66]So just be prepared for them.
[213:02.20]I'll try to give you a warning.
[213:03.06]I'll say, close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes.
[213:14.91]Close your eyes.
[213:15.37]Everybody close your eyes.
[213:17.83]Open your eyes.
[213:19.77]I'm not going to use it.
[213:26.71]Will they see this or hear this?
[213:34.25]Someone's searching for something, and we'll get the taff for it!
[214:00.07]There's guards everywhere in this mission.
[214:02.53]Oh my goodness, how am I gonna do this?
[214:06.93]Lowercase scream.
[214:09.35]Like... Oh my god!
[214:18.48]Hey, hey everybody!
[214:20.62]Hi, I'm a thief!
[214:21.64]Nobody can stop me!
[214:22.90]What are you gonna do about it?
[214:23.80]Everybody close your eyes!
[214:25.90]Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes!
[214:27.68]One, two, three!
[214:37.74]They all went the wrong way.
[214:38.50]I'm good.
[214:57.97]Open the fucking door!
[215:00.49]Alright, I'm done.
[215:01.43]No, I'm not.
[215:05.05]This is the guard quarters.
[215:06.21]Don't open that door.
[215:11.51]The door's stuck.
[215:16.90]How much do I have so far?
[215:17.76]How much have I stolen?
[215:20.78]None.
[215:20.96]Alright, there's gotta be some expensive shit up here, right?
[215:28.63]Give me a break.
[215:29.25]Look at how expensive this carpet is.
[215:43.60]Here we go.
[215:46.20]What's in here?
[215:46.96]Something.
[215:47.72]Valuables.
[215:48.88]Bingo.
[215:51.20]Lord Ramirez, the reinforced walls and steel door have been duly installed about your accounting room.
[215:57.57]But I must warn you that we cannot guarantee them against brick tunneling.
[216:01.73]If you do not move the creatures out of the basement into a more distant area, we cannot be held responsible for the potential damages.
[216:19.47]Alright, there's valuables over here.
[216:22.41]Anything in there?
[216:22.81]I don't know.
[216:23.57]How much do I have so far?
[216:24.37]I need a thousand.
[216:26.10]Alright, I got a hundred bucks right now.
[216:27.22]I need like nine more items.
[216:30.76]Let's look for hidden panels on the walls.
[216:34.16]I don't see anything in here.
[216:38.25]Alright, not a bad start.
[216:40.49]Let's go.
[216:53.05]He's walking.
[217:02.16]Ooh, a rare painting.
[217:03.56]No, that's a chair.
[217:05.44]I thought it was a painting.
[217:07.48]Hold on.
[217:10.06]Why do you have nothing?
[217:10.96]Why do you have nothing?
[217:12.96]Really?
[217:16.47]Really?
[217:24.18]Keep going.
[217:26.38]Where am I?
[217:26.80]I'm on the second floor.
[217:27.62]I could go down into the basement and go kind of into his private counting chambers.
[217:36.60]Okay, this top of the- Wait, let me check that other room.
[217:47.03]Why does your mic have an echo?
[217:48.37]It shouldn't have an echo.
[217:56.76]Alright, open this door.
[217:58.66]The key.
[218:02.06]Walk, pick.
[218:05.74]Ooh.
[218:07.29]Is that working?
[218:17.05]I don't know what's happening here.
[218:20.28]Got it, I guess.
[218:26.04]Hold it.
[218:38.35]Alright, private stash.
[218:39.49]What do we got?
[218:59.65]What?
[219:06.50]Open.
[219:11.57]There's nothing even in here.
[219:16.61]Don't press that button.
[219:20.07]That's the Diet Coke button.
[219:26.30]Ooh, expensive.
[219:28.20]Very expensive stuff.
[219:31.20]What was that?
[219:31.58]200. 200.
[219:37.31]Oh, well, I don't need that, no.
[219:39.57]Commissioner Danean.
[219:42.69]I note with displeasure that, again, one of my tough boys has been taken to Craigscleft.
[219:47.38]May I remind you of the substantial donations I make to your office, such that I may pursue business unhindered by idle scrutiny.
[219:56.14]May remind you as well of your predecessor's unfortunate end.
[220:00.28]The rivers are so treacherous this time of year.
[220:03.11]I trust that you will attend to this.
[220:05.63]And if the hammers are too difficult for your policemen, I trust as well that you'll let me know.
[220:09.11]Okay.
[220:12.53]I hear something.
[220:24.38]Private's book stash or something.
[220:25.70]What is this?
[220:28.51]What is this place?
[220:29.07]This is weird.
[220:40.53]That looks expensive.
[220:42.20]Oh my goodness.
[220:42.92]Very expensive.
[220:43.62]Nice.
[220:49.08]Can I get in there?
[220:51.84]How much more do I need?
[221:00.39]I'm going to pick up.
[221:02.07]Yep.
[221:03.78]Alright, I'm collecting money.
[221:08.98]I'm doing alright.
[221:11.87]Where?
[221:12.11]Who?
[221:15.57]Who's running?
[221:16.63]I hear somebody.
[221:28.75]Somebody up there?
[221:29.57]Next to the gigantic explosive barrel?
[221:34.85]I can jump in that window.
[221:39.82]I wonder if I should try it.
[222:06.35]Not worth doing.
[222:13.67]I can get it.
[222:26.42]Nice.
[222:26.74]Okay, so what do I do with this?
[222:31.51]What's the point of all this?
[222:32.71]What did I just do that for?
[222:44.65]What was this for?
[222:45.57]Did the lock pick my way out of here?
[223:09.98]Where is this guy?
[223:14.56]The grass is not this loud.
[223:18.12]Secret ladder.
[223:18.70]Secret ladder.
[223:19.24]Secret ladder in that fireplace.
[223:20.47]Secret ladder in the fireplace.
[223:21.55]Fireplace has a secret ladder.
[223:23.73]Secret ladder?
[223:24.23]Are you serious?
[223:32.66]Go back and extinguish the fireplace.
[223:33.82]There's a secret ladder in there.
[223:47.15]The guy right here.
[223:52.67]Oh my goodness!
[223:53.67]How did you wait for me?
[223:54.87]You knew I was coming somehow!
[223:58.84]Wow, that was terrifying.
[224:00.00]Geez, alright.
[224:08.64]Well, I gotta be careful.
[224:09.60]I'm just gonna wait till they leave the room.
[224:15.61]He's right here.
[224:16.27]Speak your head out here.
[224:17.55]I'm going to bludgeon you in the face.
[224:44.94]The roof is really loud.
[224:46.16]Moss.
[224:51.81]I'm over the ledge.
[224:54.47]I have an idea.
[225:12.26]Close your eyes.
[225:13.85]One, two, three.
[225:15.67]I didn't want to fucking do that again.
[225:17.63]How am I going to do this?
[225:54.37]I gotta get into the darkness here.
[225:56.01]No!
[225:59.99]I think I have to just wait till they get bored.
[226:12.43]Use the bomb arrow?
[226:26.06]I accidentally let go.
[226:27.06]I slipped off.
[226:34.96]There's no arrow.
[226:36.70]I figured out why I miss.
[226:38.61]There's no drop on these arrows.
[226:41.55]They go in a straight line.
[226:44.57]There's no drop.
[226:50.80]Alright, one on one.
[226:54.79]Let's go, buddy.
[227:18.53]Ooh, touche, touche.
[227:25.21]I don't think this guy knows how to swing a sword.
[227:28.52]That guy does never train how to swing a sword.
[227:42.95]Anybody have anything on them?
[227:46.53]That was just a prop for that guy.
[227:49.58]They don't have anything on them.
[227:50.66]Alright.
[227:52.60]How could I have missed that?
[227:54.40]We're good to go.
[227:55.48]I have no more fire arrows, though.
[227:59.15]Oh, dude.
[227:59.67]You guys weren't kidding around.
[228:01.03]This is a secret entrance here.
[228:02.29]Oh, now that's important.
[228:08.79]Now this is important stuff here now.
[228:17.27]Oh, hell yeah.
[228:19.99]Somebody else's bedroom or something?
[228:22.76]What's this?
[228:27.66]Can I climb through here?
[228:37.52]Can't get through this?
[228:40.81]I can't go through it.
[228:41.41]I'm trying to stuff in.
[228:46.77]I can't.
[228:51.86]I can't.
[228:56.24]I can't.
[228:56.64]How much money do I have now?
[228:59.79]675.
[229:00.59]No.
[229:01.31]Total of 380.
[229:01.99]I got 1100.
[229:02.79]I got it.
[229:03.13]I have enough now.
[229:06.63]Reagan just mentioned take what he values most.
[229:08.35]The purse from his belt.
[229:10.35]So I gotta find his... Where's his room?
[229:15.26]I have enough.
[229:16.34]Where's his room?
[229:27.53]Alright, nice.
[229:28.03]I got enough money.
[229:31.57]Now I gotta find his personal belt?
[229:36.99]Is this his room?
[229:38.29]Second floor, basement, Ramirez Mansion.
[229:42.41]I feel like his room is still somewhere.
[229:45.39]He's in the basement.
[229:48.07]Do I have to go to the basement?
[229:58.63]I'm on the first floor, no?
[230:01.25]Keep going?
[230:07.78]Did you say there was a creature down here?
[230:09.08]Like, don't... Watch out for that creature that you kept down there or something, right?
[230:21.19]I don't see a creature.
[230:34.19]Still in the basement.
[230:34.93]This is a pretty... I got a key, though.
[230:41.83]Hell yeah.
[230:47.97]There's an alarm.
[230:59.01]Oh, is that him?
[230:59.77]That's him, that's him, that's him, that's him, that's him.
[231:01.27]That's him.
[231:01.57]I think that's him.
[231:02.77]That's him.
[231:12.98]The king sends his regards.
[231:17.46]It may be time.
[231:43.94]No!
[231:44.52]I wanted to get the... Yeah, there's like a bunch of shit in here.
[232:04.91]I want to get the money first.
[232:16.58]I'll just end the mission.
[232:17.40]Wrong one.
[232:25.34]No.
[232:27.64]Really?
[232:27.94]How do I get in here?
[232:29.24]Does he have a key?
[232:37.26]I can't open these.
[232:44.89]Here we go.
[232:45.43]Hell yeah.
[232:46.17]What's in here?
[232:46.71]The other one works for this too, doesn't it?
[232:49.38]Thank you very much.
[232:51.56]What do we got?
[233:03.68]What?
[233:03.86]Open it up.
[233:04.76]Open it!
[233:07.23]Nice.
[233:07.39]Alright, I just want to get all the items.
[233:11.51]Alright, here we go.
[233:12.15]Hell yeah.
[233:13.45]Got it.
[233:21.70]Hot Coke button?
[233:23.72]Nah.
[233:24.01]Alright, cutscene coming up.
[233:34.35]That was a cool mission.
[233:36.05]I like that one.
[233:40.02]Stealing fur and fang of beasts for survival.
[233:44.74]Then came the Builder who brought us the Hammer.
[233:50.63]And with it we forged a new way of life.
[233:57.29]To reject the Hammer is to denounce the Builder.
[234:00.51]The Book of Hammers.
[234:03.22]I was going to pay Lord Randall and his vase collection a visit, but the downwind thieves guild beat me to the score.
[234:10.78]word is that they haven't divvied the booty yet apparently their leaders Donald and reuben are arguing over the prized sapphire base sounds like they could use what do you mean the creature there's a creature down there or something that I can like what do you want to do steal the base from them they'll be so busy blaming each other no one will suspect an outsider
[234:34.06]The downwinders you can milk the creature it's a meme.
[234:37.56]Okay.
[234:37.89]Well, I don't I don't really care the guild's hideout is beneath the casino I have a real map of the complex.
[234:45.41]I got from sources from the inside Once I'm in the overlords fancy.
[234:50.38]I'll have to search for the secret entrance to the hideout I have to be careful
[234:55.44]Somebody said, you should really skip this mission.
[234:57.38]Does this one suck?
[234:58.66]Skip this mission.
[234:59.12]It sucks.
[234:59.38]Yes, this one sucks.
[235:00.12]This is the worst mission in the game.
[235:01.40]Skip this one.
[235:25.42]I don't think I can skip missions.
[235:29.53]This one has an incredibly confusing layout.
[235:34.39]I mean, is it possible that I could bunny hop all the way to the end and pick up the item?
[235:38.37]I skipped this one in my playthrough too.
[235:40.01]Really?
[235:40.27]Why is it so bad?
[235:43.51]Alright, break into the Downwind Thieves' Guild by breaking into the Gambling Den, the Overlord's Fancy.
[235:50.32]Shrieve the Sapphire Vase.
[235:53.86]Guildmates stealing the vase is more difficult.
[235:55.46]Make them pay.
[235:56.08]Don't leave with less than a thousand in loot.
[235:59.64]Get out of the guild and back- Alright, so just take a thousand bucks, get the vase, and get out.
[236:05.02]Is he enough?
[236:11.62]Uh, I- Yeah, I'm taking, like, at least two of these.
[236:18.99]Yeah.
[236:20.17]Maybe not that many.
[236:24.18]See you in four hours.
[236:25.14]I can't even... I don't think I can skip.
[236:31.82]I'll figure it out.
[236:32.72]Whatever.
[236:36.36]I like the water arrows, though.
[236:37.48]They're very useful.
[236:40.33]Alright, that sounds good to me.
[236:41.15]Let's go.
[236:47.37]Okay.
[236:48.15]So...
[236:50.63]Yeah, that is a... I feel like I have to go like this and lean in real close and get to about here and then the girl from The Exorcist is going to scream in my face.
[237:03.96]What is this map?
[237:10.85]Okay.
[237:13.65]Howdy.
[237:17.75]Come on out and play.

[238:20.54]Um, what are you talking about?
[238:28.06]What am I doing?
[238:28.62]I'm, like, passing out.
[238:31.44]What's happening?
[238:33.91]Security is necessary to prevent exposure and dilution of talent.

[240:30.99]I'm just every orc in every movie.
[240:40.52]Let them do their little cutscene and I'll move on.
[240:44.59]Reeves, ball sutter.
[240:45.81]It's me.
[240:47.83]Security is necessary to prevent exposure and dilution of talent.
[240:52.12]Do you want to argue with the Lords?

[243:18.87]Alright, I'm going this way.
[243:19.95]I'm not just gonna go in the front door.

[245:02.23]Alright, let's just take this guy.
[245:08.17]Money helping doesn't work when you have a person.

[245:14.23]Yeah, it does.
[245:16.23]Alright, get into the casino.
[245:21.48]Save it right here.
[245:23.58]What is this place?

[245:33.95]That's locked.

[265:49.50]Where would I be?
[265:51.26]What an awful map.
[265:52.08]I might as well just guess.
[266:05.21]I have absolutely no idea where this would be.
[266:06.81]Is that Overlord's Fancy?
[266:16.04]I wonder, in the fire.
[266:17.30]Hold on.
[266:19.52]Did I go over here?
[266:23.70]I did not, okay.
[266:26.36]Whee.
[266:29.65]She doesn't know where I am.
[266:53.79]You wuss.
[266:56.73]Wuss!
[266:57.49]Don't let that guy ring the bell!
[267:04.88]Why do you have to just run all over the place?
[267:14.76]What are you doing?
[267:19.31]Okay, I'm fine.
[267:29.62]There's a dead guy over here.
[267:31.17]Look.
[267:32.11]There's a dead lady too.
[267:42.59]Look.
[267:43.97]Let me give it to you straight.
[267:45.55]The guy that you work for is a real bad guy.
[267:49.39]He's a mean person.
[267:50.63]He's corrupt.
[267:52.40]He has all kinds of awful shit going on.
[267:55.22]I'm just telling you right now, I'm giving you an opportunity for you to go, for you to get out and leave.
[268:00.92]I'm going to take a bunch of shit from this guy because he's a bad guy.
[268:03.58]Someone's searching for something and we'll get the taft for it.
[268:07.16]Exactly what I'm talking about.
[268:08.12]Exactly.
[268:08.54]So you and I are on the same page.
[268:11.19]So, I mean, if you feel like it, you can just kind of forget that I was here.
[268:14.97]And we can just go on with our days.
[268:19.11]Yeah, there's a dead guy right here, but don't worry.
[268:21.59]I'm not going to shoot another arrow at you.
[268:30.76]I know this is going to be really gruesome, but this is just how it is.
[268:33.90]Welcome to the business.
[268:36.14]I don't know if you knew this person or not, but they were potentially bad.
[268:39.40]They were trying to shoot me with arrows.
[268:41.32]I thought we had an understanding.
[268:44.26]I thought we had an understanding.
[268:46.00]I thought we had an understanding.
[269:04.19]How do I get down here?
[269:06.79]Over here!
[269:07.75]He has a sword!
[269:08.97]He's right here!
[269:11.21]Yes, hi!
[269:12.43]How are you?
[269:13.75]There ain't nobody left.
[269:16.67]All the guards are dead.
[269:17.74]I just- You know what?
[269:19.74]I'm just trying to help here.
[269:21.96]There's nobody left.
[269:23.02]I killed all the guards.
[269:24.60]Yes, I have a sword.
[269:25.46]Yes, I have a bow and arrow.
[269:26.82]I'm not gonna hurt you.
[269:28.16]I'm just- I'm not going to.
[269:29.72]Please leave.
[269:31.65]Go into like a Minecraft gold dungeon.
[269:36.46]Holy shit.
[269:37.32]Oh my god.
[269:37.88]You led me to the secret room Davy till Dono and Ruben quit their bitchin best.
[269:44.68]We just stick to our own turf.
[269:46.18]I'm too much Donald's man to risk it Alright He has a sword
[270:06.52]This lady, I swear to God.
[270:18.24]Okay.
[270:19.32]I've not gone down here yet.
[270:20.38]Let's save it.
[270:27.90]I wonder if there's something down here.
[270:50.82]This doesn't open?
[271:01.96]Where am I going?
[271:03.99]It's the creature.
[271:04.61]It's a spider.
[271:05.83]Relax.
[271:12.81]It's loud.
[271:14.75]I can't break those, though.
[271:21.31]Am I going the right way?
[271:22.09]Dude, okay.
[271:33.85]I have no idea.
[271:35.33]I hope this is the right way.
[271:36.77]Okay.
[271:53.02]I couldn't do anything about that.
[271:54.14]Thank you.
[271:55.36]I heard vase.
[271:55.72]I heard vase action.
[271:56.18]I heard vase...
[272:24.08]Holy shit, you're awful.
[272:25.88]Oh, okay, you got me with that one.
[272:27.22]That one was in the head.
[272:28.69]That one was in the face.
[272:29.57]I... Yeah, that was actually not bad.
[272:33.85]That was not bad.
[272:35.89]But now you pissed me off.
[272:41.02]Climb the ladder.
[273:00.10]Alright, the vase is down here somewhere.
[273:12.87]Oh my God!
[273:13.75]Hey, what was that?
[273:16.51]Drop that weapon!
[273:25.58]Don't move!
[273:30.91]Oh!
[273:40.43]Now you have a sword.
[273:42.37]I don't like it.
[273:52.92]Stop running.
[273:55.44]Stop running.
[273:56.56]Open this door.
[273:57.51]Open this door right now.
[273:59.48]Open this door right now.
[274:06.08]Shit.
[274:10.18]I'm stuck.
[274:17.78]I'm actually kind of glad I got stuck.
[274:19.02]Anybody have any keys on him?
[274:22.08]No?
[274:22.90]I need health.
[274:25.26]Cucumber?
[274:30.62]Save it here.
[274:32.62]Now, what is going on with this?
[274:33.54]This is blocked.
[274:41.18]47.
[274:41.44]47.
[274:43.56]What does it say?
[274:44.50]Something about 47?
[274:45.59]What was it?
[274:45.95]I have to get in here.
[274:54.93]I can't get in here, though.
[274:58.13]Is there a drill?
[275:06.60]That way.
[275:06.90]I think I gotta go this way, right?
[275:17.88]Help!
[275:18.38]There's someone in here!
[275:26.87]Help!
[275:27.93]Please!
[275:44.41]What do you want me to tell you?
[275:49.19]I gave her like 100 opportunities to leave.
[275:53.53]She's just yelling and she's going to get attention called to here.
[275:55.96]Alright, now, what do I need to do?
[275:58.02]I need the sapphire vase.
[276:01.40]47's over here.
[276:05.53]What do I do with this, though?
[276:07.37]I can go over... I don't know.
[276:09.51]There's a tunnel in the water.
[276:17.01]You mean like down here?
[276:19.79]Oh, look at you.
[276:24.15]Can I open that?
[276:32.22]Can't open that.
[276:36.23]A hundred opportunities.
[276:37.13]I did, I really did.
[276:37.75]47, there it is.
[276:50.06]Alright, 47.
[276:50.42]47, 48.
[276:55.63]What is this for?
[276:56.13]Should I just do them both?
[277:04.86]Is there something?
[277:05.28]There are doors.
[277:12.06]Hold on.
[277:19.07]Alright, whatever.
[277:20.79]Open 48.
[277:23.23]Literally writing in the wall.
[277:24.59]Good puzzle.
[277:25.23]I mean, yeah, but so what?
[277:32.87]Milk?
[277:41.38]So I opened the door that's labeled 47.
[277:44.00]I don't remember even a door labeled 47.
[277:51.16]Get me out of the water.
[277:55.12]What's this?
[278:04.15]Okay.
[278:05.83]So I opened that.
[278:08.19]Does that do anything?
[278:09.25]Up here or something?
[278:10.37]I don't know.
[278:15.39]Yeah, 47, 48.
[278:15.98]Something back here?
[278:22.46]I have no idea.
[278:33.09]49.
[278:38.14]Well, shit.
[278:38.88]I don't know where to go.
[278:41.67]Remember, this level was really... There's a window on the other end.
[278:44.57]Two doors in Tunnel From Before.
[278:49.49]Window.
[278:52.01]Like back here?
[279:00.36]Uh... Like here?
[279:02.78]What's over here?
[279:11.96]I actually unironically skipped this.
[279:13.34]This level sucks.
[279:17.10]I think I just found it.
[279:35.34]Nothing's so tame.
[279:36.78]He can scarp out the way he came quick enough, but he don't want to go till he's got something.
[279:41.43]So he sweeps everything on the dresser, jewelry, candlesticks, whatnot, into his sack.
[279:46.13]Gets halfway down the stairs when the sack starts leaping about.
[279:49.88]Sounds like Owen Wilson.
[279:51.52]He's cut the lady's cat, too.
[279:54.00]Cat claws a hole in the sack.
[279:55.84]Everything falls out except the cat.
[279:58.18]And that's halfway up his arm with claws every which way.
[280:03.46]Oh, actually, I bugged the cutscene.
[280:04.90]Perfect.
[280:05.20]Hey.
[280:37.65]Into the dark, into the dark, down, down, down.
[280:39.05]Okay, safe.
[280:42.01]This guy was stealing something from the dressers.
[280:44.61]Shut up!
[280:44.85]Huh.
[281:06.29]I gotta get this other guy too.
[281:07.38]He walks all the way over here.
[281:08.90]Watch.
[281:09.12]Here we go.
[281:27.43]No, you didn't see anything.
[281:28.17]This is a good hiding spot.
[281:33.63]I'm gonna use this as a hiding spot.
[281:37.20]Yeah, that's a good spot to hide.
[281:38.06]I can go even deeper, or... Let me peruse this area first.
[281:46.24]There's probably something here.
[282:06.78]Oh.
[282:07.46]Is that money behind the bed?
[282:10.38]It is.
[282:11.61]Very nice.
[282:19.35]Explosive barrel.
[282:28.48]Oh, come on.
[282:29.10]I thought these were bags of, like, Scourge McDuck money.
[282:32.34]Whatever.
[282:52.23]There he is.
[282:52.61]Got him.
[282:53.23]Thank God.
[282:53.67]Alright, what's in here?
[283:00.87]Nothing?
[283:07.62]Why are the bricks sideways?
[283:11.86]I don't know.
[283:26.43]Anybody in here?
[283:27.03]Treasure in here though.
[283:29.59]Oh, hell yeah.
[283:30.15]I definitely have to be at the threshold now, right?
[283:34.85]I don't have a thousand bucks yet?
[283:36.11]How?
[283:38.74]That seems impossible.
[283:46.48]Can I get this one too?
[283:53.80]I can't unsee the vertical bricks now.
[283:56.34]It's weird.
[284:01.24]Oh, nice.
[284:05.68]Don't throw a piece of dynamite in here, please.
[284:10.16]Nothing?
[284:13.32]What a terrible room.
[284:14.28]Give me a break.
[284:21.50]What's that?
[284:25.72]Oh well, too many imaginings.
[284:30.36]It was real.
[284:45.31]Is someone over there?
[284:48.45]Glad it was nothing.
[284:53.65]I don't like this.
[285:00.63]Don't think you can hide for long!
[285:04.55]We've got an intruder!
[285:08.09]How have you not triggered this?
[285:10.17]How have you not triggered this?
[285:14.31]Excuse me.
[285:14.95]Over there.
[285:21.07]Oh well, sorry.
[285:22.49]Guess it was nothing.
[285:23.21]I don't see anything now.
[285:28.17]What's that?
[285:34.25]Shit, someone's coming.
[285:34.83]Something hidden?
[285:45.53]No?
[285:47.99]Skip this level.
[285:48.99]I'm probably... I'm almost at the end of the level, probably.
[285:51.11]We're probably right at the end.
[285:51.95]For the last time, tell the maid to stay out of the banner room and don't touch anything in it.
[285:58.20]It is the room where I can have peace of mind.
[286:00.24]My collection is too precious to risk any calumnies.
[286:02.32]Okay.
[286:04.39]Any clumbliness.
[286:10.21]So, hit the banner.
[286:11.15]It's all over.
[286:12.27]Go to the banner room.
[286:13.11]Ugh.
[286:17.12]I'm gonna come.
[286:21.16]You're not even halfway.
[286:23.34]You're not ha- What?
[286:24.66]How am I not halfway?
[286:27.86]You're halfway through or less?
[286:30.92]This mission's the worst.
[286:33.12]How do I skip it?
[286:37.18]I don't think I can skip this.
[286:44.20]Press control alt shift and put your entire fist in your mouth.
[286:46.80]Okay.
[286:57.55]I'm right.
[286:57.95]Look, I'm in the guy's quarters.
[286:59.05]I thought I saw something.
[287:08.97]What's going on?
[287:09.65]How are you?
[287:10.73]Nice to see you.
[287:14.33]Somebody hear that?
[287:27.32]Right there.
[287:32.95]Oh, no.
[287:33.71]It's alright.
[287:40.41]Line aside him.
[287:45.65]See you later.
[287:53.78]Here's the next guy.
[288:09.25]Alright, I'm up here now.
[288:10.13]Private quarters, let's go.
[288:11.03]Alright, what's this dude's name?
[288:18.86]I don't know.
[288:22.84]Huh?
[288:38.93]Hey!
[288:41.11]Get!
[288:42.17]Oh my god.
[288:44.53]Stop splashing around!
[289:09.25]Oh, you idiot.
[289:12.21]You won't stay hidden for long, Tapper.
[289:15.86]What'd he say?
[289:16.26]Okay, here he is.
[289:37.36]Alright, don't touch my things.
[289:38.30]Don't touch my things, right?
[289:39.46]Don't touch my things.
[289:41.84]Got it.
[289:53.71]Fuck.
[290:00.73]Fuck!
[290:01.69]Where's the key?
[290:08.90]Remember, did you plug in the smelloscope for this game?
[290:15.36]You needed to clear some levels.
[290:16.46]Oh!
[290:16.56]You can't be serious!
[290:20.22]Not when I'm this far into the game!
[290:56.25]Who makes doors that open like this?
[290:58.25]Why?
[290:59.55]Open the whole fucking way.
[291:01.69]Alright, how do I open this?
[291:30.63]That's the safe right there.
[291:32.51]I need a key to get in there or something.
[291:34.04]Is it in his room?
[291:37.20]With a key.
[291:37.98]With a lockpick.
[291:38.85]Key in the other house.
[291:42.37]What do you mean other house?
[291:46.90]Note, this is possibly the most complicated map in the game.
[291:50.95]From conversations or scrolls, you can easily miss... Hold on, this is important.
[291:55.87]You can easily miss.
[291:56.53]You will gain the following knowledge.
[291:57.75]Donald has Lord Randall's vase locked in his private safe in the west.
[292:02.42]Ruben has a stolen... Ruben has stolen the key to Donald's safe.
[292:06.95]He's also entrusted his house key to his right-hand man, Tom.
[292:10.96]You must first find Tom, get the key to Ruben's house, steal Donald's safe key from Ruben's quarters, then retrieve the vase from Donald's safe, bro.
[292:19.60]I'm in the wrong house?
[292:24.42]Is there a console command to skip the game?
[292:37.95]Like, what's the console command?
[292:41.13]Just play the game.
[292:41.85]Alright.
[292:42.11]Alright, well I know where this guy's house is.
[292:47.97]The other house on the other side of the game?
[292:49.69]This is sunk cost fallacy.
[292:57.52]Are you having fun?
[292:58.22]I mean, yeah, kind of.
[293:04.26]Okay, Ctrl-Alt-Shift-End.
[293:06.35]That's not how that- you made that up.
[293:09.43]Ctrl-Alt-Shift-End is- is you made that up as a funny joke.
[293:14.39]Ctrl-Shift-Alt-End?
[293:15.95]I feel like it's gonna al- it's gonna do- Ctrl-Shift-Alt-End.
[293:33.70]I feel like I could have accidentally pressed all those at some point in the game.
[293:37.24]Okay.
[293:51.79]I'm sorry, I skipped it.
[293:54.85]Everyone told me to skip it.
[293:56.37]Look, this is an old game.
[293:57.41]Sometimes old games have like hard, weird levels.
[294:08.43]A lot of people in chat were saying this next level is like the best level in the game.
[294:11.47]I was contacted by a woman named Victoria.
[294:14.65]How many levels are in the game?
[294:16.19]I was impressed by the way I took care of Ramirez and now wants me to steal something for him.
[294:22.66]The target is a magical sword owned by a nobleman and collector named Constantine.
[294:29.44]Little is known about Constantine except that he is an eccentric new face in the city and mostly keeps to himself.
[294:37.42]This next level is a skipper.
[294:38.72]We'll see.
[294:39.34]I now have that power.
[294:40.18]They're telling me it's confusing already.
[294:42.70]It's a maze?
[295:08.25]Skip.
[295:08.35]Well, I know I can at least complete the game by skipping.
[295:10.89]This game is fun, though.
[295:11.67]This is cool.
[295:12.09]You guys have to remember, this game was made in like 1989 or something.
[295:14.67]It was a long time ago.
[295:32.81]Okay.
[295:33.71]Find and obtain the sword.
[295:34.83]It's probably on an upper level of the mansion.
[295:37.32]Take the opportunity to steal other valuables.
[295:39.04]Leave the mansion with the sword.
[295:46.38]A lot of stuff.
[295:49.38]I want more of these.
[295:56.95]What the f- What?
[296:00.11]How much do these cost?
[296:03.34]Okay.
[296:04.80]Uh, another mine?
[296:05.96]No, the bombs, they just don't do it.
[296:07.50]They cause a lot of problems.
[296:09.18]The mines suck.
[296:10.70]They're loud.
[296:11.50]They don't go off right away.
[296:13.12]They're terrible.
[296:17.57]And flashes flash me, too.
[296:19.03]They're awful.
[296:19.99]You know, I'm just gonna get more fire arrows.
[296:21.57]Just get another one.
[296:23.79]These at least kill people.
[296:30.18]But I probably should get a heal.
[296:31.70]Okay, yeah, another potion.
[296:32.62]I need a potion.
[296:37.58]Alright, let's go.
[296:38.10]Come back.
[296:46.25]Alright, get into the mansion.
[296:49.07]Steal the sword.
[296:50.01]You got it.
[296:50.37]Is the guarded entrance right...
[297:05.11]This is perfect.
[297:05.79]Come back here.
[297:06.99]Perfect.
[297:09.17]You can't see shit.
[297:09.93]Come back here.
[297:11.37]Don't come this close.
[297:15.39]Thank you very much.
[297:18.59]I'll take that.
[297:19.94]Thank you.
[297:36.34]Wait till he turns around.
[297:40.70]And I'd like to know what happened there.
[297:52.85]Wait, he saw me run?
[298:05.96]Not very good swordsman, are you?
[298:16.37]Nice key you got there.
[298:43.49]I love how, like, when something happens, I, like, look to you.
[298:47.78]I, like, look over to you.
[298:49.80]Right?
[298:50.04]I, like, look to you.
[298:52.02]Almost like I can't believe it, so you must not be able to believe it either.
[298:55.84]I'm looking at you like you're a person.
[298:58.12]Like, can you believe what just happened?
[299:02.73]I'm over here for reassurance.
[299:04.88]That, like, I'll turn and I'll see, like, a bunch of, oh my god, dude, that was fucked up.
[299:48.38]Try sneaking, that's a good trick.
[299:54.08]I got the key off of you?
[299:58.68]Alright.
[300:04.23]I'm just going in the front door, I'm in.
[300:13.85]Whoa, what was that?
[300:20.40]Oops.
[300:29.28]Oh, shut up.
[300:34.48]I've already used so much health already.
[300:47.84]It's bad news.
[300:48.66]Alright, I'm in.
[300:49.77]I got in the front door, though.
[300:52.53]Now we slow down.
[300:57.89]Be careful with everything.
[300:59.15]I steal a bunch of stuff.
[301:02.67]Alright, nice.
[301:07.33]Anybody coming?
[301:08.07]Oh.
[301:11.35]You gotta be kidding me.
[301:12.27]Right when I open the door, he's there.
[301:19.09]Did you sidestep me?
[301:20.85]I got sidestepped.
[301:30.67]He just led me to the treasure chest.
[301:34.59]What a dope.
[301:51.33]Okay.
[301:54.37]This is the main entrance here.
[301:55.53]We're gonna wrap this way.
[301:56.81]So the sword is up in the top floor.
[301:58.29]It's the same room.
[302:12.90]That's a big vase.
[302:30.98]Upstairs.
[302:31.54]I'm not done yet.
[302:32.64]I think there's more stuff here than there is.
[302:33.76]It's all just bottles.
[302:40.38]That's it.
[302:43.91]Wow, this is pretty.
[302:44.51]That's really pretty.
[302:58.44]Who's hearing me?
[303:04.30]I see you there.
[303:05.60]Come out.
[303:07.81]Drop that weapon.
[303:09.37]Don't move.
[303:20.75]Get out of my way.
[303:21.67]I'm stuck on the chandelier still.
[303:23.09]Alright.
[303:23.65]I'm just going the way that I was supposed to go and it's this way.
[303:32.63]Take out the club.
[303:33.27]Let's go.
[303:40.81]a weird... I feel like I'm on the set of a Nickelodeon sitcom.
[303:44.01]Like, what is this?
[303:44.69]This is kind of creepy.
[303:57.71]Ooh.
[303:59.09]Info right here.
[304:01.02]What does it say?
[304:05.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[304:12.57]That's weird.
[304:13.17]That's weird.
[304:14.91]That's a weird door to have in your house.
[304:16.47]That's very strange.
[304:21.87]What?
[304:22.25]Oh my god, I thought it was- I thought it was speaking to me.
[304:35.48]This is weird.
[304:36.18]There's definitely a hidden thing in here, no doubt.
[304:41.70]They have things that shoot out of their mouths.
[304:43.33]Don't move.
[304:50.55]This is, uh, this is tripped.
[304:51.93]Yeah, this is trapped.
[304:57.31]Knew it.
[304:58.23]I'm good.
[305:03.35]Oh, hell yeah, definitely.
[305:04.43]Where is it?
[305:10.09]And, like, gold nugget up here.
[305:11.77]Is that it?
[305:14.35]Pretty good.
[305:17.69]I think that's it.
[305:19.91]Nice gold rock.
[305:34.92]Dr. Seuss house.
[305:37.20]I don't like this place.
[305:39.10]I HEARD A SHOT!
[305:44.48]I was in a really good place.
[305:45.86]I gotta stop yelling, too.
[305:53.14]I'm just, like, yelling for no reason.
[305:55.94]I'm just making loud sounds.
[305:57.87]Like, I HEARD A SHOT!
[305:58.93]Like, you could just say that you heard a shot.
[306:00.85]You don't have to yell it into the microphone.
[306:03.63]They're all here.
[306:04.31]They're watching.
[306:04.85]They can see.
[306:14.01]You said you were going to be a normal person and not be a weirdo anymore.
[306:16.57]I mean, I think that went out the window.
[306:21.63]I tried.
[306:21.97]That was my New Year's resolution.
[306:22.95]But all New Year's resolutions don't work.
[306:24.31]I did it for like a day.
[306:33.76]Is this a meltdown stream?
[306:35.68]I don't think so.
[306:39.00]No way.
[306:39.36]Okay.
[306:40.93]I mean, I've been a little active, but I've been active.
[306:45.92]I wouldn't say this is a meltdown.
[306:47.08]It's not even close.
[306:48.88]I'm just kind of having fun with the video game.
[306:50.36]I already went down there.
[306:57.74]It's going to shoot again, isn't it?
[307:05.38]Oh!
[307:12.74]Oh, that was fucked.
[307:20.05]Fuck this wall.
[307:24.55]That scared the shit out of me.
[307:25.83]What do you think?
[307:26.19]How do you think I feel?
[307:27.17]It happened to me.
[307:30.64]What do you think?
[307:31.02]How do you think I feel?
[307:31.80]It happened to me.
[307:36.42]I'm the one that got hit by the car.
[307:39.22]You watched me get hit by the car.
[307:41.04]I had to get hit by the car.
[307:52.92]Your scream was scarier than the thing.
[307:57.94]Okay, don't... I gotta be careful.
[307:59.38]Alright, don't get trolled by the stupid joke room.
[308:05.51]Alright, go ahead.
[308:06.43]3, 2, 1, shoot it.
[308:06.89]What the hell am I doing?! !
[308:27.02]Is it turn?
[308:27.76]Oh.
[308:35.68]Alright, this Charlie and the Chocolate Factory funhouse.
[308:45.25]Wait, will he get hit by this?
[308:49.13]This will shoot him, right?
[308:54.03]Someone will.
[309:10.42]Whoa, what's down here?
[309:12.19]Okay, um... Where's he going?
[309:40.82]Oh, fuck.
[309:46.45]Oh, fuck!
[309:50.25]Got him.
[310:04.30]Okay.
[310:05.64]That was just- that was do or die right there.
[310:07.00]I had to do that or it was over.
[310:11.43]Where is this guy, down here?
[310:15.15]Oh shit.
[310:16.21]Oh, that hurts, right in the head.
[310:47.57]Alright, we're good.
[310:48.05]I wanna go in that weird door on the ground.
[310:56.01]Wait.
[310:57.31]What am I doing?
[310:58.20]Is there a second floor?
[310:59.64]Third floor?
[311:00.14]What am I doing here?
[311:01.22]Do I go in there?
[311:06.36]You can cheese guards.
[311:38.85]Shoot him!
[312:07.81]You just sounded like Finn from Adventure Time.
[312:10.11]What the fuck is this place?
[312:17.90]Fuck this level.
[312:19.40]This level sucks.
[312:28.56]It's just like a trap funhouse.
[312:30.00]Like, what is this?
[312:30.76]Alright, I guess I'll walk over here and get eaten alive by the monsters.
[312:35.84]Get off of me.
[312:56.16]This place is huge.
[312:59.44]I gotta go up.
[313:07.10]There's the bug room.
[313:08.04]Okay.
[313:15.91]Let's open this one with a pick lock.
[313:20.11]Where are we at?
[313:24.25]Cash.
[313:26.05]Very nice.
[313:26.59]Alright, I'm on the top floor.
[313:37.29]No.
[313:38.57]Where's the... There's another floor?
[313:39.89]Where?
[313:40.19]This looks like the top floor.
[313:42.25]Come on.
[314:04.09]What happened to those people?
[314:08.57]Okay.
[314:18.63]Nice.
[314:24.13]I gotta find a staircase up.
[314:29.56]Secret in the fireplace?
[314:31.74]I think there might be.
[314:32.68]Look at that.
[314:33.40]Right above.
[314:33.90]Looks like a button.
[314:39.84]Oh, it's just where the fireplace shit goes.
[314:42.46]Okay, whatever.
[314:43.98]Um, hello.
[314:54.52]Oh, hell yeah.
[315:02.72]Alright, I gotta find a staircase.
[315:13.25]This is the main entrance.
[315:18.79]This goes down, I believe.
[315:21.43]Yeah, so I gotta go up.
[315:24.71]And in here, I've been pretty much everywhere.
[315:26.84]I've been everywhere.
[315:32.16]Okay, I can go up from here.
[315:35.94]Oh, you unlucky bastard.
[315:39.22]I don't know how you turned around.
[315:41.22]Give me that key right now.
[315:47.54]Give me the key.
[315:50.37]Got it.
[315:55.65]I gotta put them behind them.
[315:56.73]At least put them behind them.
[315:57.49]Stealth game, by the way.
[315:58.43]I know.
[315:58.87]It's... I am stealthing.
[316:00.41]I'm... I'm in a funhouse right now.
[316:03.89]It's hard to stealth when you don't even know what room you're coming out from or going into.
[316:06.85]Uh, I'm... Okay.
[316:22.70]Ooh, more stuff.
[316:26.34]Is this the big dining room?
[316:27.24]Yep.
[316:32.28]Remember, this is violent.
[316:35.18]You fell off.
[316:44.35]How long do you think I could have an underbite for before somebody that's new to the channel is like, what are you doing?
[316:59.92]I gotta go over this way.
[317:04.64]What the fuck?
[317:05.52]I need more potions, I think.
[317:19.67]That hurts to do that.
[317:20.51]He had a key, too.
[317:24.45]Alright.
[317:24.75]I haven't been out here.
[317:28.13]Marlon Brando.
[317:41.84]Whoa, weird stuff over there.
[317:51.14]That's a pretty cool garden.
[317:55.76]That's not a bad garden.
[317:56.80]That's cool.
[318:09.67]Night.
[318:09.89]Magical tree stump?
[318:12.01]Wait, this is...
[318:33.82]This is underneath the- where- what is this?
[318:37.38]This is really weird.
[318:38.12]Can I climb up here?
[318:41.26]There's a door up here.
[318:43.90]Wait, ro- rope arrow.
[318:44.76]What's the point of this being in the game?
[318:59.86]It only works on wood.
[319:02.64]Wood.
[319:03.78]Apparently it only works on wood.
[319:12.55]We're going to like Jurassic Park now.
[319:21.71]Okay.
[319:22.27]Time to go visit the Keebler elves.
[319:24.45]This is so strange.
[319:27.11]What is this all doing here?
[319:40.80]Yeah, this is crazy.
[319:44.28]Oh, there's your wood.
[319:45.26]Yeah.
[319:45.48]Can I go up?
[319:51.84]I can't even shoot up.
[319:53.02]I can't go up.
[319:55.82]There's nothing to even do this for.
[320:06.07]What is going on?
[320:15.32]Isn't that just into somebody's mansion?
[320:28.51]Walls or trees?
[320:34.92]Wait, I can go down here.
[320:44.82]I was already here.
[320:45.62]OK.
[320:49.06]Uh.
[320:49.16]A swim.
[320:51.04]I wonder if this takes me somewhere.
[321:02.58]Please take the next left you see.
[321:04.00]I'm not joking.
[321:05.11]This is left.
[321:17.27]I took the left?
[321:24.29]Pardon?
[321:26.83]Um... Wait a minute.
[321:30.39]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[321:36.29]Wait a minute.
[321:40.83]I haven't saved it in a long time.
[321:42.98]He won't come in the water.
[321:54.20]We're safe.
[322:03.82]What is he doing?
[322:13.99]Get in the water!
[322:14.55]Get back in the water!
[322:34.04]Okay.
[322:36.48]Did I make it through this garden?
[322:38.48]Is this a new area that I haven't... No, I've been here before.
[322:40.78]Guys, I have no idea what's going on right now.
[322:54.83]Back on the second floor.
[322:55.89]Let's open this one.
[323:04.76]You gotta follow the music.
[323:05.76]Thanks for staying up late, by the way.
[323:11.86]I know we're at about 9.30 Pacific, which means we're past midnight Eastern, so thanks for staying up.
[323:20.53]This looks important.
[323:26.14]Nothing in here, though.
[323:37.91]It's gonna be a trap room.
[323:39.35]Crouch.
[323:44.62]E and... I already read this one.
[323:54.16]Pastor, the one who trespassed your greenhouse is chastised.
[323:57.96]He did not know the rules, but spies there no longer.
[324:01.03]The one who trespassed your greenhouse...
[324:08.56]Is that where I just was?
[324:09.26]I think I was just there.
[324:26.96]I didn't go this way.
[324:35.41]Really?
[324:39.26]Really?
[324:41.40]Can I not open this?
[324:41.98]Shit.
[324:50.69]Really?
[324:57.61]Really?
[324:57.83]Nice try.
[325:06.57]Good try.
[325:08.05]I will commend you for the effort.
[325:16.46]Alright, third floor.
[325:18.50]Right?
[325:19.32]No, still the second floor.
[325:29.16]PB&J or grilled cheese?
[325:31.66]Uh, I would say grilled cheese.
[325:34.23]I gotta be in the mood for a PB&J.
[325:37.51]But a grilled cheese I could eat at any moment of any day of any time.
[325:40.93]It could be 2 o'clock in the morning.
[325:42.19]It could be 8 o'clock in the morning.
[325:43.21]I could have just woken up.
[325:44.67]I could have just, you know, gone to sleep.
[325:46.57]I think I'm where I'm supposed to be.
[326:04.67]No, don't pull this shit on me right now.
[326:08.39]I'm already kind of getting tired, and I- this is- this is one of those everything's upside down things.
[326:13.31]I, um... I'm going up.
[326:22.16]Going up.
[326:24.76]You eat grilled cheese in your sleep.
[326:29.08]I mean, I don't, I'm just- I'm just saying it's good whenever.
[326:34.42]You can enjoy a grilled cheese at any moment of the day.
[326:41.02]I'm looking for the sword.
[326:42.14]How do you guys even na- I feel bad for you guys, I really do.
[326:47.12]Honest to god.
[326:48.83]Like, how do you navigate all this?
[326:51.69]You must have a headache all day.
[326:53.45]Oh my god.
[327:11.31]I don't want to do it.
[327:13.03]I'm done.
[327:15.31]I think I'm done.
[327:16.97]This game is really fun.
[327:18.53]I'm done.
[327:22.71]What's your favorite type of cheese?
[327:24.27]I like Swiss cheddar, provolone.
[327:29.77]Super Mario tubes.
[327:31.61]What else do I like?
[327:32.97]I like...
[327:45.11]Just give me the sacred baseball bat, whatever the fuck it is.
[327:48.49]Get out of my way.
[327:50.83]Get out of my way.
[327:51.79]Give me the sacred sword, whatever it is.
[327:53.81]Where is it?
[327:54.19]Parmesan is a hard, yeah, I love, shea parmesan is fantastic.
[328:05.97]Did you hear that?
[328:07.81]It was like giggling.
[328:08.67]It was like a giggling gnome person.
[328:14.43]Don't worry.
[328:15.51]I'll find you.
[328:28.48]Don't make me come find you.
[328:31.84]Ah!
[328:33.69]Ah!
[328:42.29]You've got a bow too.
[328:49.39]You are in my way.
[328:53.42]Oh my god, a sacred sword.
[328:54.42]Get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out.
[329:02.24]How do I get out?
[329:14.37]SHIT!
[329:40.02]The mines are worthless.
[329:40.80]This is the worst item in the whole game.
[329:43.00]Worthless item.
[329:43.84]What's it worth?
[329:44.26]I can't even say worthless.
[329:45.70]Why can't I say worthless item?
[329:56.08]I hear somebody.
[329:56.52]It's like somebody screaming.
[330:05.68]Do you hear this?
[330:08.64]Step on this.
[330:15.10]Somebody's going like, get out!
[330:16.72]Get out!
[330:17.69]Oh my god, get me out of here.
[330:40.26]Somebody's laughing.
[330:41.51]You heard it.
[331:04.83]Su- uh, what?
[331:06.17]That was like the- that was like fucking- this is Mario shit.
[331:09.77]This is the Mar- this is like Mario 64.
[331:11.51]This is- Can I leave?
[331:38.50]I can't open this from this side.
[331:40.54]Of course I can.
[331:43.02]Get out of my way.
[331:52.31]Oh, this way, this way.
[331:52.87]What was that?
[332:29.48]Get me out.
[332:34.08]Oh, shut up.
[332:47.85]The music is getting scarier and scarier.
[332:55.19]I'm trapped in this goddamn house.
[332:59.10]I'm trapped in this house.
[333:00.44]I'm stuck here.
[333:07.06]This way?
[333:07.44]Then I could go right.
[333:10.56]Yup.
[333:11.28]And then... Here's the f- that- this is the entrance.
[333:22.54]I got out.
[333:26.23]So the lady was laughing and making all kinds of weird sounds.
[333:30.92]That was terrifying.
[333:31.50]That was a fun level though.
[333:33.22]That was a good one.
[333:48.21]It gets worse?
[333:51.36]It gets much worse.
[333:52.81]Oh, God.
[334:17.81]Hello, Jerma.
[334:18.37]This is SpongeBob.
[334:19.27]Do you have any questions for me?
[334:20.20]Yes.
[334:20.28]PBJ or grilled cheese, SpongeBob?
[334:21.12]Which one?
[334:21.70]Animated.
[334:45.68]You brought me here to kill me.
[334:47.46]But you have it all wrong, Mr. Garrett.
[334:49.84]Would it surprise you to know that it was I who hired you to steal my own sword?
[334:54.98]Yes.
[334:56.22]You see, Victoria and I are... Old associates.
[335:00.30]Yes.
[335:01.34]You were being tested.
[335:02.62]Do you understand?
[335:04.52]And I must say you more than live up to your reputation.
[335:07.88]Wait.
[335:08.14]You are quite an extraordinary thief.
[335:10.86]Testing me.
[335:12.70]What is it you want from me?
[335:13.75]You have Satan hooves?
[335:15.37]I am a collector Mr. garrett but there are some items that are not available for purchase they must be acquired using other means in this case the item in question would be best acquired by thieving not simple thieving no I need an artist like yourself what exactly is this item it is the gemstone he's got like goat hooves
[335:41.51]unusual appearance yes kept hidden in the sealed cathedral deep inside the halls of the scum hammerites oh but forgive me you are possibly friendly with the order of the hammer no fanatics make unreliable friends excellent I am prepared to offer you quite a sum a hundred upon receipt of the eye I don't see how I can refuse such an offer marvelous
[336:10.38]Is this the final mission?
[336:11.68]No, okay.
[336:12.00]There's a few more.
[336:12.74]This is mission number six, right?
[336:45.08]Come the time of peril did the grounded gape, and did the dead rest unquiet against us.
[336:53.39]Our bands of iron and hammers of stone prevailed not, and some did doubt the builder's plan, but the seals held strong and the few did triumph.
[337:07.09]And the doubters were in chat thinking he wouldn't beat the last level, but he did.
[337:12.18]Laying into the minions ride at Universal Studios.
[337:16.16]Pretty lit.
[337:17.92]I don't know.
[337:21.02]I'm done.
[337:21.60]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[337:22.62]Not tomorrow.
[337:23.26]What day?
[337:23.44]What's today?
[337:23.80]What's today?
[337:29.66]Saturday, okay.
[337:30.16]Alright, I've got a question for people in chat here.
[337:32.70]I plan on streaming again on Wednesday.
[337:35.24]I was gonna do VR.
[337:58.73]Soon.
[337:59.23]I think I want to do one more game stream.
[338:02.75]I want to do Everhood.
[338:03.85]But I also kind of want to finish this.
[338:15.56]How much more time is in this game?
[338:17.18]Another couple hours maybe?
[338:18.22]Two, three hours?
[338:23.42]This is fun.
[338:24.74]It's a little old, it's a little crunchy, but I'm having a good time.
[338:30.80]So what I'll probably do is on Wednesday... It's probably two... There's like eight missions.
[338:42.87]Thief 2 is better.
[338:45.11]Oh, there's a lot more.
[338:46.03]Okay.
[338:48.97]This might take more than another stream.
[338:50.19]Alright.
[338:52.55]Well, I'm down to play again.
[338:53.93]I know... You just... You got sucked into a wormhole.
[339:01.97]Oh yeah, I'll play Yakuza again.
[339:05.20]I'll play Sam & Max again, Season 3.
[339:08.22]Oh yeah, I'll play No Umbrellas Allowed.
[339:11.54]Oh yeah, I'll finish.
[339:13.85]I'll finish Hollow Knight.
[339:16.33]Oh, I'll fi- I know.
[339:18.27]I'll do Monster Rancher 2.
[339:19.81]I know.
[339:20.31]Trust me, I know.
[339:25.04]Trust me.
[339:32.92]Or Hollow Knight.
[339:35.90]But no, I actually will probably... I'll probably see it again.
[339:38.65]Wednesday, I want to do Everhood.
[339:40.85]But if there's time, I also kind of want to maybe do this too.
[339:43.79]And or I'll just do this... Maybe I won't do VR yet.
[339:47.41]Maybe I'll finish this or play some more.
[339:49.25]If not, then this is really fun.
[339:50.34]It's cool to play it for a while.
[339:53.62]Wednesday, Everhood's the plan.
[339:56.42]But, you know, we'll see.
[340:00.48]What about All of Us Part 2?
[340:01.58]No, All of Us Part 1 was enough.
[340:04.36]Let me save it though.
[340:07.42]Yeah, let me just, let me get prepared.
[340:08.57]This is the, seems like a big mission.
[340:13.01]Constant, oh, I actually get the new sword too.
[340:14.89]Uh, I'll take one of these.
[340:17.81]Take two of these.
[340:23.43]And I'll take a few, uh, I'll take a few of these.
[340:26.53]I think that's all I can afford.
[340:36.42]It is.
[340:37.44]Okay.
[340:39.56]Very interesting.
[340:40.74]Save the game.
[340:41.48]Hard save.
[340:42.26]Right here in the beginning.
[340:43.10]Right at the top.
[340:47.52]I think I'm going to call it here.
[340:50.70]That was really fun.
[340:52.16]If we see this again, then we see it again.
[340:53.74]If not, then that was Thief Gold.
[340:56.64]I would give that a stamp of thumbs up.
[341:01.02]I had a good time.
[341:03.41]Hope you did too.
[341:06.05]Are you going to put the ring light around your neck?
[341:07.85]If it's safe, I would do it.
[341:09.94]But I don't know.
[341:13.32]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[341:14.30]Around 4 o'clock Pacific.
[341:20.51]And I know that we're starting late a lot recently.
[341:24.61]My sleep schedule is kind of all over the place.
[341:27.45]So, once I correct it, and I can pull back my sleep schedule a little bit, we'll try to start more around that, like, 2, 2.30 area, Pacific.
[341:42.44]Yeah, that was Thief.
[341:44.98]I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[341:46.66]As always, thanks for watching.
[341:53.03]Go to the credits.
[341:59.55]Yeah, another reason why I want to start earlier is because I know that 4 o'clock Pacific, if I stream for more than 5 or 6 hours, it starts to get really late for people.
[342:15.42]And I don't want to keep everybody up crazy late.
[342:19.30]You know, 9, 10 o'clock Pacific is 12, 1 a.m.
[342:24.00]Eastern, which is just an ungodly hour, EU.
[342:30.63]I'd like to try to stay in that, at least most of North America.
[342:36.63]Doesn't have to stay up too late.
[342:39.59]I'm sorry, EU friendos.
[342:42.49]I live in the Pacific time zone, and I stream in the afternoon.
[342:46.03]I'm very sorry.
[342:47.89]It's the way it is, though.
[342:52.52]We have a 15-hour difference.
[342:54.60]That's ridiculous to me.
[343:04.21]Yeah, we'll at least be doing Everhood.
[343:06.49]Keep an eye out if we do something else.
[343:08.75]And then, I'm probably going to get back into VR.
[343:11.63]Hitman VR comes out on the 20th.
[343:14.82]The second that releases, we're going to play it.
[343:17.02]We're going to play it on the 20th.
[343:18.00]Hopefully it works.
[343:18.84]Hopefully there's not server problems or something.
[343:21.78]The olives?
[343:22.28]I already did the olives in the beginning of the stream.
[343:28.04]I mean, I attempted it.
[343:28.98]Can't say it went that well, but I did.
[343:35.54]I tried.
[343:46.19]When is the big stream?
[343:47.99]The big stream will probably be, I don't have a hard date for you, but it's supposed to be somewhere in the end of January into maybe the first or second week of February.
[343:57.82]I don't have a date yet, but I will give it to you.
[344:00.88]There's a lot of factors as to what that date is.
[344:05.23]No, I missed the olives.
[344:06.57]Alright, let's raid.
[344:13.72]ConnorEatsPants is live.
[344:15.32]Connor has raided the stream a bunch of times.
[344:19.28]Really swell dude.
[344:20.92]Been a huge supporter of the channel, as you know.
[344:24.05]And I'm ending, and Connor's live.
[344:29.95]So, let's go say hi to Connor.
[344:32.43]Say hello.
[344:32.77]Hello.
[344:37.54]Um, let me see.
[344:38.36]There we go.
[344:42.00]Playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond or whatever this is.
[344:47.39]If I die in the game, I die in real life.
[344:50.43]Okay.
[344:54.71]Say hi to Connor, everybody.
[344:57.27]Say hello to Connor.
[344:59.03]Connor!
[345:00.79]No, go say hi.
[345:04.98]I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[345:08.26]Good night.
[345:08.88]Goodbye.
[345:09.92]Take care of yourself.
[345:10.48]Sleep well.
[345:12.26]Have a good one.
[345:13.91]Good night.
[345:56.71]He's literally at the very end of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond.
[345:59.84]He's literally at the last cutscene of the game.
[346:04.02]Just be aware of that, by the way, guys.
[346:05.83]Be aware of that.
[346:07.09]He's literally at the last cutscene, I think.
[346:09.09]I have no idea.
[346:09.69]That's what he just said.
[346:10.67]Alright, be careful.
[346:13.48]I'll see you later.
[346:29.90]you
