[ve:60.16.100]

[00:24.99]Good evening.
[00:26.96]How are you?
[00:28.16]What's up?
[00:29.91]What is happening?
[00:31.01]How are you?
[00:31.84]How the heck are you?
[00:42.39]We got a good one today.
[00:43.82]Not that they're not all good ones.
[00:47.64]I just, I'm excited for this one because we're tapping back into
[00:57.56]of the SEGA CD.
[01:00.70]I have stacked up here...
[01:03.33]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven SEGA CD games.
[01:11.02]Unfortunately, one of them doesn't work, so six.
[01:15.50]I might do a bonus one or one of these might take the entire stream.
[01:19.26]We don't know.
[01:20.67]That's how these work.
[01:27.22]Alright, can we ban all the middle schoolers, please, in this chat?
[01:31.61]Can we ban the middle schoolers, please?
[01:33.66]What would that do?
[01:34.31]Can we get rid of that?
[01:44.40]What's the fine vintage?
[01:45.51]The SEGA CD is the fine vintage.
[01:49.25]You would lose a lot of viewers.
[01:53.21]Whatever.
[01:58.86]Your shirt is on backwards.
[01:59.94]My shirt is on forwards.
[02:08.15]No, it's the high schoolers that are the problem.
[02:12.01]Can we ban everybody under the age of like 25 here?
[02:16.16]This is a 40 year old only stream.
[02:19.46]Only 40 year olds are allowed to watch my stream now.
[02:25.66]Once I cross 40.
[02:27.73]That's just the way it is.
[02:28.59]You have to be 40.
[02:31.14]Okay, how many people would actually be here, do you think?
[02:33.88]There's been me and like three guys, you know what I mean?
[02:36.33]That'd be weird to me.
[02:38.70]Like, oh hey, we banned everybody under the age of fucking 25.
[02:42.33]Alright!
[02:43.36]We're going to have a super mature group of people.
[02:45.71]It's going to be so great.
[02:46.86]Everyone's good.
[02:47.36]We're going to talk really slowly.
[02:50.01]There'll be five viewers.
[02:54.42]What would you say in chat?
[02:58.53]Would you even say anything?
[02:59.52]Or would you be like, nah, dude, I'm lurking.
[03:01.38]I'm not going to be one of the four 40-year-olds that says anything.
[03:08.04]Yeah, right.
[03:08.60]Here's the deal.
[03:10.02]It'd probably be like two or three thousand.
[03:15.34]Hey, I'm 40 and I'm here.
[03:18.18]So, hey.
[03:20.31]Hey, can we get a shout out to the 40 year olds, please?
[03:22.38]Like a shout out to the 35 and older crowd.
[03:26.24]Shout out to the 35 and older crowd, please.
[03:28.91]Shout them out.
[03:31.08]What is that?
[03:31.86]What is that?
[03:32.33]I don't know.
[03:32.75]Alright.
[03:34.15]Are you guys ready?
[03:36.12]We just banned all the middle schoolers.
[03:37.79]We did it.
[03:39.33]We went through with it.
[03:48.32]Uh, I was gonna start with WWF.
[03:51.62]Uh, WWF Rage?
[03:54.66]Or raw or something?
[03:55.83]I think it was the cage.
[03:57.21]Rage in the cage, I think is what it was.
[04:00.23]The CD won't boot.
[04:02.31]We're going to have to try something else for that one.
[04:05.24]I might have to do a SEGA CD enhanced for that one.
[04:11.03]But the first thing we're going to do is Batman and Robin, the adventures of Batman and Robin.
[04:17.83]Let me bring you back over here.
[04:19.47]My hair's a little fucked up today.
[04:21.00]I'm not going to be on cam all stream, by the way, for all you facecam Andes.
[04:27.74]But we do have to show it.
[04:28.86]I just got out of the shower, so my hair is fucking crazy right now.
[04:32.17]It's not cut.
[04:33.82]It's getting cut in the new year.
[04:36.41]And I'm going bald.
[04:41.86]Alright, here we go.
[04:43.94]Hi, how are you?
[04:45.79]Yes, I'm 40.
[04:47.16]Shout out to the 40 year olds, we need glasses.
[04:49.81]Alright, coming up first.
[04:52.16]Here it is, I'll show it.
[04:53.48]Batman and Robin.
[04:55.39]It's got a cool box.
[04:56.42]It's nice.
[04:57.71]You can see it.
[05:00.14]Shiny.
[05:04.34]They put this shit in every SEGA CD box, which is interesting.
[05:09.68]They did it to, I think to protect the disk, right?
[05:12.07]This just lays on top of a disk.
[05:14.40]Why don't they?
[05:14.87]Why are they not?
[05:15.59]Why don't they do that anymore?
[05:19.10]The SEGA CD company and associates cared so much about your disk being okay, that they put a little pad on it.
[05:30.39]They don't do that anymore.
[05:34.82]Beard's gone?
[05:35.48]Oh yeah, beard's gone.
[05:37.04]Once this fills, my hair will fill out a little.
[05:39.23]It's fine.
[05:40.17]Alright, it's going in.
[05:40.73]You guys ready?
[05:41.64]Batman and Robin.
[05:42.46]The Adventures of Batman and Robin.
[05:46.11]For the...
[05:47.79]I gotta be careful with this thing.
[05:53.29]Ready?
[05:54.38]One, two, three.
[05:56.44]Dude, wait till you see what's coming up next.
[05:59.22]You look like a worm tongue.
[06:01.36]Oh, yeah?
[06:01.58]Well, here's what you need.
[06:04.45]Listen to me.
[06:06.44]Yeah, you mean, when you say worm tongue, you mean the guy that controls everything?
[06:10.18]is what you meant to say.
[06:16.63]Yeah, you meant to say the guy that literally controls everything?
[06:23.68]No, he doesn't.
[06:24.29]Yes, he does.
[06:25.10]He's the one that whispers in the guy's ear and he turns like purple and does whatever I tell him.
[06:32.11]Alright, this one already has, like, some audio crunches.
[06:36.24]Cool lava lamp?
[06:37.12]Hey.
[06:38.81]We can see the quality audio coming up here, I think.
[06:43.66]Turn it up.
[06:46.72]Hi.
[06:54.21]Does this sound correct?
[07:06.53]Oh, cartoon.
[07:12.66]I might crop the top.
[07:14.20]I did a little bit of cropping.
[07:26.76]Dude imagine having a little platform like that in your basement just to stand on and look at nothing.
[07:33.63]I would actually love that.
[07:42.73]Batteries, turbines.
[07:45.70]Don't you guys love that Batman has the UI that would be on like a fourth graders toy?
[07:55.40]That's how you control the Batmobile.
[08:02.47]There are toddler toys, I think, that are more complicated than what we just saw.
[08:08.94]Alright.
[08:09.76]Where am I going?
[08:13.29]I only have 53 seconds to save the world.
[08:18.80]Do not hit the civilians?
[08:24.21]Get out of the way, Batman's got places to be!
[08:27.61]Alright, do I, wait, do I run out of missiles?
[08:39.28]These missiles suck, by the way.
[08:40.46]They don't do anything.
[08:41.15]Stop hurting civilians, Batman.
[08:49.28]Now they're all pulling over.
[08:51.73]They're like, oh shit, you are a menace to Gotham City?
[08:56.33]Why are they pulling over for the police but don't pull over for Batman?
[08:59.93]Wait a second.
[09:01.96]That's a very important question.
[09:04.16]Why would you not pull over for Batman, but you'll pull over for the police?
[09:09.40]Batman isn't a cop.
[09:10.75]Why doesn't he have a different signal?
[09:13.63]Batman should have like a bright pink signal or something.
[09:18.31]He should have lights.
[09:21.18]So people know it's Batman.
[09:26.27]Because we have, you know, a red and white ambulance, red and blue police.
[09:29.75]There needs to be like a bright... Green doesn't make any sense.
[09:33.09]Bright pink.
[09:44.58]Okay, well, why is Batman deciding to do this in the middle of traffic?
[09:47.75]It's like 6 p.m. Why would you choose to save the world at 5.30?
[10:00.63]This sucks, dude.
[10:02.05]What the fuck am I doing?
[10:07.97]I'm sorry, but my operating hours as a superhero?
[10:14.11]I ain't leaving the house between 4 and 7 p.m.
[10:17.22]You got me at 8 p.m. to like 3 o'clock in the morning.
[10:20.03]You got it.
[10:20.41]10 a.m. to 12.
[10:23.21]You got it.
[10:25.79]I guess I made it to stage two.
[10:34.38]Okay.
[10:39.37]Stop cutting me.
[10:40.41]Why would you cut Batman off?
[10:48.89]Dude, you cut Batman off.
[10:50.12]That's a guy you do not want to get out of the car.
[10:53.60]Bro, bro, I don't know, man.
[10:54.81]You really pissed that guy off.
[10:57.21]Dude, he's getting out of the car!
[10:58.82]He's getting- Oh shit, man.
[11:00.47]Oh, wait.
[11:01.01]It's this guy in a Batman costume.
[11:02.88]Dude's a fucking wuss, don't worry.
[11:04.59]He's just a weirdo.
[11:07.40]If you cut some guy off and he gets out in a Batman costume, are you scared or are you like, this dude's kind of cool?
[11:12.16]I think I'll talk to him.
[11:13.47]I think we can hash it out.
[11:25.53]Do I just drive?
[11:27.02]How far away is this building?
[11:44.09]I'm holding back the urge to shoot a missile right now.
[11:48.74]Okay, the people in the orange cars drive like shit.
[11:58.52]Get out of my fucking way!
[12:01.61]Is there a horn?
[12:19.19]Lily and Violet must be stopped.
[12:21.26]What?
[12:23.45]Like right now?
[12:26.46]I don't know if that's a civilian.
[12:27.64]Is it a civilian?
[12:28.63]What the, were they shooting monsters?
[12:52.03]Whose health bar is at the top?
[12:57.38]Oh, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one.
[13:03.30]Why are there all of a sudden aliens in Gotham City?
[13:14.42]I have to focus, I have to focus.
[13:25.05]Oh my fucking god.
[14:06.11]Dude, it's impossible to avoid the octopus things!
[14:29.70]Got it.
[14:31.49]Make it easy on yourselves ladies.
[14:34.67]Where's your pretty boss?
[14:39.78]Boss bite.
[14:43.07]Flattery will get you nowhere, Batman.
[14:45.03]Except to an early grave.
[14:49.82]She has web slingers?
[14:57.17]If I have to chase her in a car rather than fight her here, this game's a 0.0.
[15:03.62]I'm adding a new type of green to my collection.
[15:06.81]But here's an old favorite I brought just for you.
[15:18.44]What is that?
[15:32.83]Wait, Robin's gonna show up.
[15:35.34]No, Robin's gonna have to drive here.
[15:37.98]Hold on, Batman, I'll be there in 30 minutes.
[15:41.27]New York traffic is, well, Gotham traffic, it's the same fucking place, but it's okay.
[15:48.96]No!
[16:02.28]Is it weird that I think it's weird that he has an ass crack?
[16:05.46]Is it weird that I think it's weird that he has like a defined ass crack?
[16:13.94]Why is he using it?
[16:17.68]And then they have tools?
[16:24.65]I thought Batman had better... ...rings.
[16:29.42]Jeez, Batman, settle down.
[16:37.36]Oh no.
[16:47.96]Hey, we gotta... Oh no!
[16:51.13]We've gotta chase down Poison Ivy and shoot missiles in her trunk!
[16:56.25]Okay!
[17:00.53]I don't know if it's working, but it is.
[17:05.34]Faster, Ivy's getting away.
[17:06.81]What do you mean faster?
[17:08.05]I'm holding the button down.
[17:11.14]Why are there trees?
[17:13.66]Why are there trees?
[17:14.40]Why are there trees in the middle of the road?
[17:22.03]Oh, wait, she's making them.
[17:23.52]I was like, what poor city planning from the Gotham fucking city council.
[17:42.77]I think I lost her.
[17:44.07]I don't see her anywhere.
[17:46.33]Look, I'm at max speed right now.
[17:47.88]I'm going 100, I'm going 95 miles per hour, which in little kid terms, you may as well go in like Mach 5.
[18:12.64]Damn it.
[18:13.68]No, not this tree shit again.
[18:19.96]Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast.
[18:23.23]Too fast.
[18:28.99]There's no way to dodge that many trees.
[18:35.13]this is stupid
[18:54.25]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[18:56.55]Where is she?
[18:58.95]Stage three.
[19:16.88]I'm getting fucking smoked.
[19:32.30]Did I get it?
[19:36.69]Oh no no no, she's doing bushes now.
[19:42.23]What the fuck is happening?
[19:43.61]Why am I hitting the branches?
[19:52.00]Alfred, Alfred, I'm taking heavy damage.
[19:54.96]Alfred, I'm so glad you put on 6,000 coats of paint.
[19:59.86]I didn't believe you when you were doing it, but I guess it worked.
[20:05.14]It's very dented.
[20:05.89]It's like a clay car.
[20:07.27]But, Alfred, I owe you.
[20:13.09]What's going on with the time?
[20:14.62]What's the time?
[20:19.26]I thought that was a timer at the top.
[20:23.50]I thought that...
[20:25.52]It's the distance to...
[20:28.03]I thought it was a timer.
[20:44.48]Alright, lock in, lock in, I gotta-
[21:07.60]Man, this is impossible!
[21:40.00]The distance does mean absolutely nothing, by the way.
[21:50.51]I was at 31 distance almost that whole time.
[21:52.92]28 to 31.
[21:54.71]And nothing, it didn't matter.
[21:57.52]It's all scripted.
[22:01.24]I need a bad battery.
[22:10.05]I need a bad battery right now.
[22:19.40]Shit, that was a bad battery.
[22:30.12]There was another fuckin' bad battery and I avoided it somehow.
[22:40.80]Give me a fat battery!
[22:54.47]Damn it!
[23:00.49]74 meters away!
[23:06.19]How am I ever gonna catch up?
[23:12.19]This is not...
[23:14.11]I'm...
[23:14.38]Okay, alright.
[23:14.92]Reset, reset, reset, reset, reset.
[23:17.71]Reset, reset.
[23:25.75]Fuck you, game.
[23:40.03]Okay.
[23:41.52]Speed's ahead, and then you have to... Don't get hit.
[23:44.30]Just don't get hit.
[23:48.42]Bad battery good.
[23:56.30]Double bad battery good.
[24:01.65]I just launched a fucking nuke at something.
[24:04.73]I didn't mean to.
[24:18.67]I fucking hate this game.
[24:20.54]I'm about to just delete it.
[24:22.23]I'm going to hit the eject button in a second.
[24:24.22]Like, why would you want to play a Batman game when you're just in the car?
[24:28.21]This has to be this fucking intro.
[24:29.63]Hold on.
[24:51.34]Dude you have to hit every button at the same time!
[25:00.91]What the fuck?
[25:30.58]You can't turn fast enough to go from one lane to the other, even if you try to stay in the middle.
[25:35.84]And she's getting away.
[25:45.53]I can't believe this.
[25:48.67]I cannot believe that this game has dodged trees in the street.
[25:55.40]And the hitbox of the trees is the whole fucking lane.
[26:00.65]Oh my god, this is unbelievable.
[26:09.19]Can I go faster?
[26:10.29]Is there like a button combination to speed up?
[26:17.62]Last try and I'm done.
[26:25.78]Anybody know?
[26:27.55]Watch out for the branches.
[26:28.67]Alright, anybody have like a... Is there like a nitro boost or something I'm not doing?
[26:44.81]Why are you blushing?
[26:46.18]I'm not.
[26:46.87]It's an intense game.
[27:28.31]Why did I just get so much extra speed?
[27:35.67]The game is, okay, the car goes too fast for you to move to get out of the way of the fucking trees, dude.
[27:43.45]but I can't even control the vehicle.
[27:50.61]You need to go fast, but if you go fast, it's not enough time for you to turn the sluggish-ass fucking thing.
[27:58.29]I can't believe I'm getting this bad at a game that...
[28:05.74]I got through it, apparently.
[28:08.97]Ivy cannot escape now.
[28:10.74]Ooh!
[28:21.39]Alright, I got to speak.
[28:23.34]Everyone quiet.
[28:33.67]What the fuck is this bowling ball shit?
[29:29.17]Aiden!
[29:30.76]Oh...
[29:40.26]It's over, Ivy.
[29:50.00]On the contrary, Batman.
[29:51.81]Your ordeal is just... Don't look at her eyes.
[29:53.57]She'll turn you to stone.
[29:55.16]Hand her over, Bats.
[29:56.90]We just got word one of your old enemies kidnapped Commissioner Gordon.
[30:00.59]What I can tell you is that while our dear Dark Knight was chasing me, two of his closest allies were being abducted.
[30:08.80]Wait a minute.
[30:11.71]Where did you take them?
[30:14.09]Where are they?
[30:14.97]That's for you to find out.
[30:16.84]Hopefully before they're executed.
[30:18.77]Take the flower girl downtown and grill her.
[30:21.70]I want some answers.
[30:24.17]I think I can make it to the Gotham Bank in 45 minutes.
[30:27.05]It's all part of the game.
[30:38.28]Wait, maybe not.
[30:40.32]Ivy said it's all part of the game.
[30:42.77]That's pretty obvious her hint was about... the Riddler.
[30:48.79]No, it's not.
[30:51.64]Does the Riddler play games or does Rizzler, the Rizz, not the Rizzler.
[30:57.18]Alright, let's go, let's drive there.
[31:03.22]Oh no, not the Riddler truck dodge level!
[31:06.83]Anything but that.
[31:16.58]This take took a lot of coordination.
[31:21.58]You know, like the Riddler, I have a better idea.
[31:23.69]Why don't you just rebuild a school?
[31:26.56]You know what I mean?
[31:27.14]Pre-built a Gotham school called the Riddler Academy.
[31:32.24]I feel like with the $65 million it took for you to do all this, you could have repaved a road in Gotham City and just put a billboard up with your face on it.
[31:42.23]I did this, don't forget.
[31:44.44]Even if you're a villain, it's like, whoa, this guy actually did some shit.
[31:48.46]Batman would come after you and be like, oh, the Riddler's doing...
[31:50.93]Wait, he rebuilt Gotham fucking high school.
[31:55.41]What the fuck, bro?
[32:04.81]I think we're done with this one.
[32:09.59]We've yet to see Robin's face once.
[32:12.19]It's been driving around.
[32:18.02]Robin and Commissioner Gordon have mysteriously disappeared and Batman suspects kidnapping.
[32:23.89]Hmm.
[32:25.13]Have our two comrades succumbed to the deadly beauty of Poison Ivy?
[32:29.34]Does the Riddler know the answer?
[32:31.77]Or will the Joker have the last laugh?
[32:34.24]tune in on SEGA CD to find out.
[32:39.37]Driving.
[32:41.36]is in the top right corner.
[32:44.04]Driving.
[32:46.10]Telling it to get a good look.
[32:48.26]It does say flying and action, but it is not false advertisement.
[32:54.79]It does say driving.
[32:59.94]We just didn't get, we saw the action.
[33:03.18]We didn't fly though, but it does have driving.
[33:10.64]Play like you're in the TV series with exclusive animation from the creators of The Adventures of Batman and Robin.
[33:16.74]Cool, that's cool.
[33:18.77]A plus.
[33:20.14]Two games in one.
[33:22.91]Cruise for criminals in the Batmobile or take to the night skies in the Batwing.
[33:28.90]This is two games in one.
[33:31.43]Incredible scaling 3D graphics make every enemy and obstacle leap off the screen.
[33:37.08]So this is two games.
[33:38.13]The driving is considered a full game.
[33:40.66]And then the flying on the same roads is considered a second game.
[33:45.10]Interesting.
[33:46.71]While you're reading, while driving, we're fine.
[33:49.26]Alright, this next one is an important one.
[33:52.54]So I don't want to blow your ears out because sometimes when I hit the button, it goes like...
[33:58.90]This next one is going to be really crazy.
[34:00.79]I don't know what to think about this next one.
[34:03.83]This is a very rare game.
[34:06.26]This is a game that was hard to find.
[34:09.03]It is a full motion video QTE game, I think.
[34:12.93]It's old, it's stanky, and it's Time Gal.
[34:19.46]I think it's kind of like a cult classic.
[34:26.78]I've heard crazy things about this.
[34:30.16]It's on the SEGA CD, yep.
[34:32.65]This one was hard to find.
[34:36.67]dye your hair snot green?
[34:38.48]That's funny, I guess.
[34:41.08]No, it's because it's drying.
[34:42.35]I got a really hot room.
[34:44.72]So it's drying out.
[34:45.91]It's going to be frayed out.
[34:47.04]Oh, on a break, I'll brush it or something.
[34:48.47]I don't care.
[34:49.55]You'll be fine.
[34:50.74]But yeah, it's like an anime QTE, kind of like Dragon's Lair.
[34:56.97]Have the time of your life with 16 thrilling levels.
[35:00.61]Over 30 minutes of full motion animation.
[35:03.30]the order of the levels is randomly generated so every adventure through every adventure is different three difficulty levels
[35:11.84]and CD quality sound.
[35:15.77]This is a rare one.
[35:16.98]Uh, I was holding onto this one for a while.
[35:18.34]I've been, I've been itching to play this for like four or five months at least.
[35:22.79]So how's the FPS on this camera?
[35:24.68]Is it alright?
[35:26.66]Why does it look frame ratey?
[35:32.54]I guess that's fine.
[35:40.11]It's CD quality.
[35:46.41]Alright, we got a CD quality there.
[35:49.49]Oh, I gotta show me putting it in.
[35:50.86]That's the whole point of having... That's the only reason why I put this here.
[35:57.82]I'm so sad that the WWF game didn't work.
[36:00.79]Let's be gentle with this.
[36:01.74]Cause this one was, this one was a rare one.
[36:04.20]This one was not cheap.
[36:11.35]Make your camera FMV quality.
[36:12.82]It kind of already is.
[36:13.59]It matches.
[36:17.45]What about Sonic?
[36:21.12]Dude, I have almost the entire SEGA CD North American release collection.
[36:26.29]Almost every single one.
[36:27.44]So, don't worry.
[36:28.88]I told you this is gonna take a while.
[36:31.41]We're not rushing through this.
[36:36.24]This is pretty cool looking.
[36:38.41]It's a cool looking disk.
[36:40.68]Let me get it so you can see it good.
[36:43.55]See?
[36:44.72]Time gal.
[36:47.05]Cool.
[36:49.19]Let's go.
[36:57.91]Ah.
[37:00.11]Why do you look 17?
[37:01.13]I don't, dude, will you just stop talking about the way that I look?
[37:06.62]And focus on the video game at hand here.
[37:08.45]It's an important one.
[37:14.37]We have the same mic arm?
[37:19.81]Alright, time gal, let's go.
[37:21.08]I've been waiting for this one for like six months.
[37:25.64]That was loud.
[37:28.30]Game creative staff.
[37:30.37]Wolf teams.
[37:47.41]Let's go.
[37:49.22]I can't read that.
[38:01.35]This music goes kind of hard though.
[38:04.12]It's keyboard cat?
[38:10.31]It does kind of sound like keyboard cat.
[38:33.31]Alright.
[38:57.67]I never skip the opening anime intro ever.
[39:00.74]It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it.
[39:17.59]Should I fix my camera?
[39:32.44]What's going on my camera?
[39:43.81]Is that better?
[39:46.58]I can't tell if it's better or worse.
[39:49.30]It don't matter.
[39:50.85]Alright, you ready?
[39:52.52]Stop.
[39:53.06]I'm gonna be pissed at myself for hitting that.
[39:55.50]Alright, time gal.
[39:56.32]Let's go.
[39:56.74]Are we ready?
[40:00.45]Options.
[40:01.86]Lives.
[40:03.14]Let's do four lives.
[40:04.15]I think that's accurate.
[40:05.41]We're not doing hard.
[40:06.88]effects one two three four five six I don't know let's do one I think we have to start it well I'm not doing anything crazy here
[40:19.54]Visual mode.
[40:22.27]Okay, I need a password for visual mode.
[40:25.46]Here we go.
[40:27.33]I don't know what button is what.
[40:29.01]Get ready.
[40:30.81]This is 30,000 BC?
[40:40.31]What button was I supposed to press?
[40:51.29]Okay, I don't know what button it is.
[40:54.73]Is it just press button?
[40:56.14]Any button?
[41:02.26]Oh, okay, down.
[41:04.64]Oh my god, it's around the screen.
[41:06.17]It's around the screen.
[41:06.79]I get it, I get it.
[41:07.32]Okay, it's around the screen.
[41:26.19]Down.
[41:30.00]No, what?
[41:35.19]Okay.
[41:36.47]Now I understand the game.
[41:37.46]I'm going to let the continues run out.
[41:40.53]Because I understand how it works now.
[41:47.44]Why does she sound like Minnie?
[41:50.22]Like Minnie Mouse?
[41:58.52]Alright, I'm ready.
[42:10.54]Hey, on the next episode of Time Cow.
[42:14.74]In BC 30,000, Time Gal was teleported from her hometown to this wild, wonderful jungle adventure.
[42:22.96]Watch as she tries to defeat the evil lord.
[42:27.45]Master Man and his horrible minions.
[42:30.26]TimeGal, coming soon to a DVD bin near you.
[42:35.65]at 99 cents with the yellow sticker on it.
[42:50.53]I'm ready.
[42:55.39]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[42:56.23]We're at a different time!
[42:57.39]This is 6500 million years ago?
[43:13.43]Wait, what?
[43:14.14]What does that mean when it flashes your hazards?
[43:17.17]What does the hazards mean when it flashes hazards?
[43:20.06]What button do you press?
[43:28.20]Action button, OK. Got him.
[43:51.99]That's two shots in a row.
[43:59.10]Shoot the enemy!
[43:59.82]Go up!
[44:00.95]Shoot!
[44:01.49]Shoot the enemy!
[44:02.34]Go down!
[44:02.86]I don't know!
[44:03.81]How do I choose?
[44:17.00]Go down is not the right answer.
[44:20.33]Alright, I got it.
[44:27.24]The SEGA CD is one giant fucking huge-ass directional button that I pressed up.
[44:52.29]Alright, shoot, and then I'm gonna shoot.
[44:55.39]Shoot, shoot.
[44:59.91]shoot shoot no I will yeah okay that's uh I think that's fine
[45:13.40]Congratulations, you have won 5,000 bonus points.
[45:15.61]Move on to the next period.
[45:18.28]Password.
[45:20.21]Somebody write that down.
[45:22.36]Somebody write that down.
[45:23.17]I'm not writing that down.
[45:26.72]Somebody gonna get a mental screenshot from somebody please.
[45:30.86]Alright, 1600 BC.
[45:44.11]Oh, that was the most brutal of all of them so far.
[45:46.34]That crushed her head.
[46:03.65]I pressed shoot.
[46:12.17]Alright, it's right up right.
[46:21.72]I love the animation, though.
[46:22.85]It's great.
[46:28.94]That's another complete level, by the way.
[46:36.39]I'm going to get that.
[46:36.99]Hey, can you go no swearing mode for five minutes?
[46:38.90]Get out of here, you fucking idiot.
[46:42.74]Mental screenshot, please.
[46:48.10]Alright, this is the one that got me last time.
[46:57.35]I already memorized it.
[47:00.88]I didn't even touch it.
[47:03.36]My fingers were so sweaty that I think the sweat activated up.
[47:31.21]Alright, don't shoot.
[47:32.68]It's down.
[47:33.05]Down.
[47:34.50]Got it.
[47:40.72]What the fuck is that?
[47:41.76]Is this a giant spider?
[47:42.60]Okay, it's right.
[47:46.60]I was gonna shoot.
[47:52.11]Right two times, right, right.
[47:54.21]Okay, right, right.
[48:00.85]What the fuck?
[48:02.55]I prefired it.
[48:05.79]You can't prefire it.
[48:19.83]What the fuck?
[48:30.02]Alright.
[48:30.94]I got a password, though.
[48:44.15]We missed the second one?
[48:45.14]You didn't get the second password?
[48:52.47]Duh-duh.
[48:56.72]I just made cookies, if you can say the alphabet backwards.
[48:59.49]Z, X, Y, W, T, V, U, S, R, B, A,
[49:06.71]Heya!
[49:16.26]This is why we did four lives.
[49:20.14]Okay.
[49:21.14]Here's the crazy thing about normal, hard, and easy.
[49:23.57]All this is doing is giving you...
[49:25.88]four frames of time to press three frames and two frames that's not I we are we're never doing hard that's all that's doing
[49:36.73]I wonder what effects means.
[49:37.90]Alright, here we go.
[49:39.15]Oh my God, I forgot the password.
[49:41.38]I don't even need it.
[50:02.20]I didn't even need it.
[50:10.36]Alright, 650 million BC.
[50:25.16]I keep thinking it is Minnie Mouse now.
[50:26.74]Thanks a lot.
[50:37.03]Okay, go up is the right answer.
[50:40.62]Alright, I got full lives, full continues.
[50:42.15]We're at the next age.
[50:48.94]Anybody even know how we got here in the first place?
[50:58.64]You're going back in time to screw with the dinosaurs.
[51:00.39]Yeah, but why?
[51:05.43]Alright, BC 99?
[51:11.35]Uh-oh.
[51:14.61]They won't even show that one.
[51:15.58]It's too bad.
[51:22.55]Hey, good looking.
[51:26.64]You're my kind of guy.
[51:28.92]Oh, how old are you?
[51:33.89]Oh!
[51:34.31]No!
[51:35.96]Oh!
[51:37.52]What?
[51:38.87]No!
[51:43.63]Right?
[51:44.33]Left?
[51:44.57]I mean...
[51:46.82]Right?
[51:49.15]This cat is chasing me through all of fucking Rome!
[51:59.48]Got him!
[52:06.09]That I'm telling you right now, that is a great run.
[52:10.74]That was hard.
[52:13.43]Omega Lell, unplug the audio cables?
[52:15.40]What are we talking about?
[52:21.60]You ever rode a horse before?
[52:23.45]I think I rode a pony when I was a little kid.
[52:26.24]And all I remember is this.
[52:28.66]This is the only thing I remember.
[52:34.39]Well, I don't know about this.
[52:41.00]Alright, back in 30,000 BC.
[52:46.37]Wait, it's just the same thing but mirrored.
[52:54.54]It's just the same thing, right?
[52:55.71]Oh, come on, dude.
[53:03.13]Does this count as the 12 places?
[53:05.06]Because if it does, that's bullshit.
[53:08.99]There are 12 distinct ages.
[53:14.18]Come on.
[53:33.18]Thank you.
[53:47.04]Left right up.
[53:53.17]Down.
[53:55.81]Then it takes a left.
[53:59.69]Then right.
[54:01.36]No.
[54:02.54]Depth.
[54:04.55]Right!
[54:05.95]God damn it.
[54:14.08]It's fine.
[54:22.59]I realize what these games are.
[54:23.80]It's just the shoot reaction time millisecond test, but with animations that play in the background.
[54:38.69]Left again, right?
[54:41.39]Yup.
[54:51.48]Time stop.
[54:52.13]Shoot the enemy.
[54:52.67]Get away.
[54:52.99]Catch the enemy with net.
[54:55.47]Wait, I don't have the net.
[54:56.30]They have the net.
[54:56.84]That's me they're going to catch.
[55:00.82]Yeah!
[55:03.01]Yeah!
[55:10.97]Shoot enemy.
[55:21.88]Get away.
[55:22.46]Is it just get away?
[55:24.99]What is it?
[55:26.48]What is it?
[55:26.72]Which one?
[55:31.70]Did I shoot myself?
[55:36.02]I shot myself with the gun.
[55:38.37]What?
[55:45.23]Oh, come on, dude.
[55:47.01]I was...
[55:50.70]Why did I get, yeah, why did I get, was it a, wait, is it the meteor from when the dinosaurs were, roamed the Earth?
[55:57.89]What hit me?
[56:01.48]So it's just get away.
[56:02.54]That felt like it was too much of an easy answer.
[56:09.17]Get away.
[56:15.67]It's implied you shot your ancestor.
[56:18.86]That's so stupid.
[56:21.60]out of the fucking millions of people.
[56:24.15]That caveman right there was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather?
[56:32.94]Was that that exact moment at that exact time?
[56:39.97]That would suck so bad.
[56:42.32]What a terrible luck.
[56:45.46]Hey, time gal, go buy yourself a scratch ticket.
[56:48.23]You know what I mean?
[56:49.19]Wait, where are we going?
[56:50.12]We're at 700 billion BC.
[56:57.74]Ow.
[57:04.83]Alright, we got the screenshot for that one.
[57:13.44]I thought it was right.
[57:16.35]I thought it was right.
[57:30.65]Thank you.
[57:35.05]I feel like if I was in danger of my life, running from a huge scary thing, I don't think I would...
[57:40.82]The only thing I would say would not be, you can't catch me, you can't catch me.
[57:48.32]Whatever happened to, like, I have a family!
[57:50.47]I have a family!
[57:52.11]Right?
[57:52.59]Well, you can't, that's just antagonizing.
[58:00.38]She should be turning over and going, I have a family!
[58:03.04]I have a family!
[58:14.49]It was up.
[58:16.54]It was up before.
[58:17.34]Have we got any of those passwords in chat, please?
[58:24.65]What was the last password?
[58:32.38]Why would he care about your family?
[58:33.73]I don't know.
[58:34.03]That is at least 1% better than you can't catch me.
[58:38.96]In the bizarre world where that Tyrannosaurus Rex understands English, that what you're saying is going to piss him off.
[58:46.97]in the 1% chance that we're back in a period where they could understand English.
[58:50.72]It's a 0.00002%.
[59:06.70]Game Creative Staff, Wolf Team.
[59:22.97]What's with my camera?
[59:32.50]Dude, that's so scary.
[59:33.74]You can just see my eyes.
[59:49.24]Like, I don't know why my camera's so frame-ready.
[59:51.81]It doesn't- all cam- all webcams suck absolute balls.
[59:55.97]Let's be honest.
[60:04.41]It looks fine.
[60:06.56]It's just, I hate how I'm looking over at the preview and I can see that I'm like ghosting.
[60:13.22]It's like trying to do this overexposed dog shit.
[60:16.55]Cut it out.
[60:22.72]That's better.
[60:26.56]See?
[60:26.86]Look at that.
[60:28.49]Look at that shit.
[60:33.12]Alright, here we go.
[60:40.09]It's because it's too dark in here?
[60:41.13]I mean, I've...
[60:43.05]It's so finicky.
[60:45.14]Whoa, wait, there's a...
[60:47.06]Someone has a Time Gal emote.
[60:49.71]Are you serious?
[60:56.52]Holy shit, that's cool.
[60:58.53]Apparently the passwords are just to watch like a movie.
[61:02.31]We gotta go organic here.
[61:13.38]I am kind of memorizing these though.
[61:32.74]Minnie Mouse.
[61:34.46]Alright, get away.
[61:45.28]Here's my take on a webcam before we start this next one.
[61:50.27]I've probably plugged in and used and gone to the settings of, let's call it probably like 25 different webcams over the last 20 years.
[62:00.26]20 years of webcams.
[62:03.93]USB 3.0, USB 3.2, USB 2.0.
[62:07.51]And let me tell you,
[62:09.22]All of them suck.
[62:10.87]All of them are terrible.
[62:11.95]They're all awful.
[62:13.52]And they all do, for 25 years, this technology has done the same thing.
[62:17.76]If you do not obliterate your room with light, these things suck such ass, and some of them are hundreds of dollars.
[62:27.02]I think they've been using the same technology for 10 years and they just keep putting new plastic around it.
[62:35.78]I've used $30 webcams from Walmart and like $400 webcams from like different companies.
[62:43.65]They all suck.
[62:45.35]All of them.
[62:46.39]They all are the same technology.
[62:47.92]I swear to God, it's just they just put the chip in a different thing and just say, oh, this one's 4K.
[62:52.56]Technically.
[62:58.85]OK, here we go.
[63:04.87]If you don't blow up your room with meteor levels of light, they run so poorly.
[63:16.18]I thought it was shoot again.
[63:20.30]Why can other streamers figure out webcams?
[63:22.05]Because they probably have a lot of light in their room.
[63:23.59]They probably have like ring lights.
[63:25.54]I have a ring light.
[63:26.33]I just fucking hate it.
[63:27.53]I hate the bright light in my face.
[63:29.02]It sucks.
[63:31.15]I know a lot of streamers that have, like, box lights and web and ring lights all over their fucking room.
[63:37.56]Oh my god.
[63:47.92]I pressed it!
[63:48.88]Okay, I can walk in.
[63:55.13]actual cameras but that's a bit yeah I don't want to hook up like a dslr and have that like no get get out of here I don't want that in front of me
[64:11.23]Alright, it's up.
[64:26.55]I got it.
[64:35.85]They literally have, literally, they only have about two manufacturers of webcam CCDs.
[64:42.11]So almost all consumer webcams are just different plastic housing, maybe some different software to run it.
[64:50.55]Things should be different.
[65:03.05]I got this one last time.
[65:10.77]Oh.
[65:27.79]Alright, it's right.
[65:30.18]Alright, we're going to get something we might not have seen.
[65:40.38]Unless you actually use a DSLR, those you might find with a quality sensor.
[65:48.80]DSL, but I use a webcam like once every like two or three weeks.
[65:52.56]It's not something I'm willing to set up.
[65:55.51]So I will deal with this dog shit.
[66:09.67]She says it to everybody.
[66:20.46]Don't complain if you're using dog shit.
[66:23.09]I can complain about using dog shit when $500 dog shit and $30 dog shit are the same.
[66:28.45]That's a complaint territory for me.
[66:33.75]I pressed it!
[66:44.50]I've gone through 20 webcams in 20 years.
[66:46.69]Probably.
[66:49.90]The only one that was actually kind of good put a penis on the wall behind me.
[66:56.38]And I ended up dropping that, and it cracked.
[67:01.34]I, like, dropped it, and it fucking...
[67:02.91]I messed it up.
[67:08.47]But even that one was fucked up.
[67:09.61]That one put like weird colors behind me and made like a bunch of like chromatic abrasion all over my whole room.
[67:25.90]Alright, let's go.
[67:33.02]This one's go up.
[67:37.15]Are you ever going to answer why it did that?
[67:38.66]I...
[67:39.41]It just... Weird luck.
[67:41.35]I didn't do anything.
[67:47.23]Alright, let's get a new arrow.
[67:54.65]Alright, this one was actually kind of hard.
[67:56.74]I got to get through this one because the next one will definitely be new.
[68:01.82]I thought it was dodge right.
[68:12.93]God damn it!
[68:22.19]come on man I gotta get this right I'm gonna put it on easy I just want to see the cut scenes
[68:30.34]Hey, good looking.
[68:34.47]You're my kind of guy.
[68:38.13]How old are you?
[68:59.37]Yeah
[69:10.30]Alright, we're going to get a new zone, definitely, 100%.
[69:18.42]Alright, here we go.
[69:20.27]Come on, something new.
[69:22.86]1588 AD, the pirate level.
[69:43.63]shit okay alright I'm gonna give this one one more solid attempt but I'm gonna do it on easy
[69:52.34]actually got a high score okay
[70:05.82]You can buy the HD remaster of this game for $30 on Steam.
[70:11.71]That's fine, I've got the original Mona Lisa.
[70:16.69]That's fine.
[70:17.73]You go ahead and get that one.
[70:19.00]I've got the original Mona Lisa.
[70:24.80]Burnt onto the original CD.
[70:33.51]The original is actually a LaserDisc game.
[70:36.11]I have the original copy of the original.
[70:38.02]You have the copy of the copy.
[70:44.18]Hey, they still had to burn it onto a disk.
[70:46.10]Sorry.
[70:46.83]I think that's fine.
[70:51.82]They had to burn the same data onto a different disk.
[70:54.35]It wasn't a laser disk.
[70:56.62]I think that still counts.
[71:00.26]Do six effects.
[71:01.20]Let me try this once on easy.
[71:05.14]Bald streamer.
[71:05.78]I actually had a dream that I had a bald head.
[71:08.65]But it was weird.
[71:09.41]There was like a...
[71:11.70]I'll show you in a minute.
[71:19.16]Everybody wanted to see how much it receded.
[71:21.17]I was like, oh yeah, let me show it.
[71:25.12]And I kind of got embarrassed because I didn't realize just how much was gone.
[71:29.12]So in the dream, I put my head down.
[71:30.83]I was like, oh, look, look at the top of my head.
[71:32.60]I'm receding a little bit.
[71:34.21]And I didn't know that like this part here was kind of gone.
[71:37.58]I was like, yeah, that's pretty normal.
[71:39.11]But I dipped a little more and I looked at the OBS preview
[71:42.70]And I kept going down and there was a huge hole right here.
[71:47.00]And I was like, what the fuck?
[71:47.88]I didn't know that was there.
[71:49.47]Like, no way.
[71:50.17]And I pulled back and I was like, oh, fuck.
[71:53.10]I guess I had a little bit more, I didn't know.
[71:55.80]And everybody was like, bald.
[72:02.38]I don't know what that means.
[72:03.06]What does it mean if you have a dream about hair that you thought you had but you don't have it?
[72:07.32]But you actually have it in real life.
[72:10.00]Because I actually don't care if I go bald.
[72:11.50]I really don't.
[72:12.97]I know, it's like, oh, your dreams tell you about a secret...
[72:15.73]thing that you don't want to go bald and it's your subconscious.
[72:19.02]I actually kind of don't care though.
[72:21.58]I made it to 40 with a full head of hair.
[72:23.11]I don't care.
[72:23.55]That's actually kind of crazy.
[72:25.50]I'm in New Game Plus for my hair.
[72:45.90]How is easy easier, by the way?
[72:48.36]It really probably is one extra frame.
[73:01.56]Time stopped.
[73:04.03]Time stopped.
[73:12.90]shave your head.
[73:13.87]I don't think I could ever do that.
[73:15.48]I would look so awful.
[73:21.30]Okay.
[73:22.92]I gotta get through.
[73:23.58]I want to go to the pirate level.
[73:49.01]Go up.
[73:51.31]You should be the next time, gal.
[73:58.06]That actually hurt my chest.
[74:01.12]Is that normal?
[74:09.07]Alright, here we go.
[74:09.63]This one sucks.
[74:13.41]It's shoot, shoot, shoot, left.
[74:21.28]How old are you?
[74:26.09]Oh!
[74:26.35]No!
[74:31.06]Dog.
[74:31.87]Cat.
[74:43.35]jump attack alright this is this is pb right here
[74:59.62]She kind of sounds like MK64 Toad.
[75:03.38]Mortal Kombat 64 Toad?
[75:06.33]Mario Kart 64, what the hell are you talking about?
[75:09.35]Mario Kart 64.
[75:25.59]I think I just went cross-eyed for one second.
[75:27.21]Hold on.
[75:28.90]Give me a second.
[75:31.17]Alright, we're good.
[75:50.41]Alright, this is it.
[75:51.67]No, this is the PB right here.
[75:55.15]Oh, by the way, I played some Expedition 33.
[75:59.22]I was thinking about streaming it, and I want to tell you the kind of plan, the joke plan that I had for it, just because I didn't do it, and I'm not going to do it, but just in case I did.
[76:08.01]I was going to title the stream Expedition 0.0.
[76:12.24]It was like, that's a perfect thing to title this, you know what I mean?
[76:16.28]And...
[76:18.98]The game's fantastic, by the way.
[76:25.60]It's fucking great.
[76:27.19]It's a great game.
[76:30.62]Are you actually going to go through with it?
[76:32.59]I was going to, but I feel like that was going to piss a lot of people off, including me, because I think the game's great.
[76:41.86]He wanted to hate it.
[76:44.38]No, no, I told you, I went into it with a, I don't,
[76:49.35]The game is what it is.
[76:51.06]I didn't go into it thinking I was going to like it or love it.
[76:54.39]But I didn't know that it was that intricately about...
[76:59.34]dodging and parrying.
[77:01.31]It really is like a Dark Souls game.
[77:03.22]It really is a Souls-like.
[77:04.95]It is a turn-based Souls-like.
[77:07.14]And you can make it almost impossible.
[77:08.37]The game is brutal if you play on like the expert mode.
[77:12.47]I thought it was great.
[77:14.08]I think it's phenomenal.
[77:16.03]I'm not done with it.
[77:19.10]I'm not even close to being done with it.
[77:20.64]But what I have played so far has been great.
[77:28.81]A lot of people want to hate it.
[77:31.39]Did you get through?
[77:31.98]I'm not going to tell you where I got through.
[77:34.21]Because if I tell you where I got through, then you'll know where I am.
[77:36.97]And I'm in a random part of the game.
[77:41.85]It's the Dark Souls of Turn-based game with the BatChest.
[77:44.60]Look, I know.
[77:45.28]Get it.
[77:45.52]I'm a huge FromSoftwareGame type fan.
[77:47.61]I'm a huge Souls-like fan.
[77:49.28]And I'm just saying, it's fun.
[77:53.11]The game is fun.
[77:54.66]The game is fun.
[77:55.74]What do you want me to tell you?
[77:58.29]I'm a straight shooter, okay?
[77:59.76]You guys know me, I'm a straight shooter.
[78:01.45]The game's fucking fun as hell.
[78:02.96]What do you want me to say?
[78:06.78]Why are you streaming this and not Expedition 33?
[78:08.47]Because that's for me.
[78:11.76]This is for you.
[78:16.53]I actually, you don't understand how painful it was to not just play this on the couch.
[78:23.85]I was about to open this and play it.
[78:26.89]Like two months ago.
[78:27.67]I was like, I want to fucking see.
[78:28.65]I want to play this game.
[78:31.53]I'm doing pretty good.
[78:48.27]Dude, that was flawless.
[78:51.52]Oh, come on.
[78:56.39]Plus, Expedition 33 is like 100 hours.
[78:58.50]It's like a 150 hour game if you go real slow, isn't it?
[79:02.91]I wasn't ready to commit to like a 100 plus hour experience on stream.
[79:06.43]I have trouble beating Withering Rooms and that's like a 30 hour game.
[79:14.21]God damn it.
[79:17.95]The game's AI?
[79:18.74]Wait, what are you talking about?
[79:30.32]No it's not, it's not.
[79:39.23]Everyone's saying, oh man, oh brother, here we go.
[79:42.18]Wait, what?
[79:43.19]What?
[79:48.94]Oh my god, everyone's going crazy.
[79:50.74]I just said the fucking Voldemort word, didn't I?
[79:53.60]I said the Voldemort word.
[79:55.04]Out loud.
[79:58.27]Dude, I said the word AI and the chat literally went the fastest I've seen it in like six months.
[80:04.41]I have to pay attention.
[80:05.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[80:13.05]Let's go!
[80:21.69]That whole boat got fucking destroyed.
[80:34.72]Alright, what do I do?
[80:35.98]Jump into the ocean, jump on the small ship, jump on the ship.
[80:39.84]Ah, jump on the ship.
[80:41.25]We can take him out.
[80:54.83]They had an asset pack that they used in pre-production that had AI in it.
[81:00.85]Oh, well, I mean, you made it sound like the whole fucking game was.
[81:12.89]I was about to say holy shit are you fucking kidding me?
[81:26.53]I'm locked in right now, big time.
[81:32.48]No!
[81:39.87]Stop following me!
[81:45.62]Oh, no!
[81:45.75]I don't know.
[81:51.26]All I can think of right now is like
[81:53.80]Yeah, oh, fuck, man.
[81:54.90]We typed into the fucking AI prop generator.
[81:59.20]We were just like, a game where you fucking walk around and there's...
[82:02.01]We did a fucking two-sentence prompt.
[82:04.33]I don't know how the fuck we...
[82:05.68]It's crazy, dude.
[82:06.76]That's what came out.
[82:11.80]Like, oh, they have war, like...
[82:15.66]He's like, oh, yeah, we... Oh, it's just like I wrote two sentences into fucking chat.
[82:21.40]What the fuck, bro?
[82:33.60]No, I don't want to...
[82:34.35]Okay, that game is fucking beautiful.
[82:36.01]It is a wonderful game.
[82:37.60]I don't want to say...
[82:38.98]If that's not the case, then that is not the case.
[82:43.09]Dude, we're in World War II.
[82:44.74]What the fuck's going on?
[82:45.69]I stopped paying attention for 10 seconds.
[82:47.88]We're getting shot up by helicopters.
[82:59.32]We gotta get that time gal!
[83:02.85]Uh-oh.
[83:04.14]Jump up to the helicopter.
[83:05.61]Jump into the river.
[83:06.37]What do you mean?
[83:07.14]Isn't...
[83:07.62]These both are go up.
[83:08.73]They both go up.
[83:17.23]I'm rolling right now.
[83:18.38]Okay.
[83:18.85]What's the next age?
[83:27.20]1940, but this actually is World War II.
[83:29.55]What the fuck?
[83:30.63]What do you mean 1941?
[83:32.82]Wait a minute, that just freaked me out.
[83:34.27]Why are we at 1941?
[83:38.10]No!
[83:38.60]Please start us right there.
[83:52.58]What are you doing?
[83:53.48]You're ruining everything!
[83:54.67]Who is...
[83:55.46]Okay, is she... What's...
[84:00.07]Alright, TimeGal, I gotta know what side you're on here, because this could be bad.
[84:05.67]Jump on the ship, hope for luck!
[84:10.90]Let's hope for luck.
[84:16.41]What the fuck, did it work?
[84:21.22]It didn't work.
[84:22.62]Alright, prayer didn't work.
[84:28.52]Okay, that fucked me up for a second.
[84:32.39]Oh, time gal, we got, this ain't good time gal.
[84:39.59]We don't know what flags are on these planes.
[84:56.28]Okay, jump on the ship.
[84:58.13]How about jump on the ship?
[85:09.51]What?
[85:09.93]It's jump into the ocean?
[85:11.34]Isn't that the worst thing you could possibly do?
[85:14.66]It's jump into the ocean.
[85:32.43]Okay, jump into the ocean.
[85:46.74]What is it, a nuclear sub?
[86:00.27]Where am I?
[86:05.38]Oh my God, that was fucked up.
[86:07.25]She got actually torn up.
[86:09.00]That actually like ripped her up.
[86:10.15]That was fucked up.
[86:11.83]That was fucked up.
[86:16.81]Her legs got like chewed up.
[86:18.28]That was awful.
[86:34.26]Okay, here we go.
[86:35.20]Into the ocean.
[86:37.48]What the fuck man?
[86:52.52]Wouldn't this be like a...
[86:54.16]Hold on, I gotta be quiet.
[87:01.61]I keep thinking about its pretty mouth.
[87:08.97]I'm replacing her in my head right now.
[87:10.76]She's being, like, repainted as Minnie Mouse during this.
[87:13.71]And it's making it so much more fucked up.
[87:16.70]Okay.
[87:17.49]I made it.
[87:21.51]Oh my god.
[87:29.08]Where are we going?
[87:31.32]2001.
[87:32.14]By the way, this is about 20 years after this game released.
[87:42.91]This has got to be the last level, right?
[87:46.99]Why does it make fucking dirt bike noises?
[87:51.51]Oh, ow!
[87:58.77]Okay.
[87:59.45]Go straight ahead.
[88:00.17]Turn right.
[88:00.78]Make a U-turn.
[88:01.48]Make a U-turn.
[88:03.47]Is there enough room?
[88:18.48]That's the kind of shit you pull in GTA.
[88:28.99]Okay.
[88:30.10]Turn right, make a U-turn, go straight ahead, turn right.
[88:34.12]Straight ahead, I'm gonna get my head chopped off.
[88:39.47]Oh, come on, Time Gal.
[88:41.42]What are you doing?
[88:42.28]It's mine!
[88:45.62]Yeah!
[88:48.09]Oh, no!
[88:56.96]Time's up!
[88:59.13]Okay, straight ahead.
[89:00.62]That's the worst answer.
[89:01.91]I...
[89:09.25]Oh my God, dude, this is it.
[89:11.58]We're going to be at like 2020.
[89:16.65]Get ready.
[89:18.32]Three thousand and one.
[89:20.66]This is the last boss.
[89:40.05]I just... Tire screeches.
[89:47.07]Damn it!
[89:52.10]It's a hoverboard, there's no tires!
[89:54.54]Why is it making screeches?
[89:58.00]WHAT?!
[89:58.34]!
[90:09.53]I have to do it.
[90:12.71]I have to do it.
[90:13.65]That was the end.
[90:14.43]That was the last place.
[90:16.52]The tire screeching just ruined the whole playthrough.
[90:20.89]Mm.
[90:31.94]We'll be right back.
[90:38.24]Hey, do a stream where you only read from AutoMod.
[90:40.26]You already do that.
[90:41.33]That's not even true.
[90:42.31]That's like one message out of a thousand.
[90:46.57]I have to do this.
[90:48.02]But I'm just going to be quiet.
[90:49.02]I'm going to lock in.
[90:51.11]We're going to play it.
[90:51.64]We're doing it on easy.
[90:52.40]Four lives.
[90:53.36]What does this even do?
[90:56.26]What does it do?
[90:58.59]Should I even change that?
[91:02.52]There's no way you haven't gotten a single hair transplant.
[91:04.99]No, I have not.
[91:06.43]This is real shit, man.
[91:09.13]This is real.
[91:09.93]That's where I'm showing you the real thing.
[91:11.40]That's the, that's the re that's reality right there.
[91:13.85]Okay.
[91:16.17]That's salmon once or twice a week, if you can do it.
[91:19.85]That's getting enough sunshine.
[91:22.36]that's staying slightly hydrated that's this is the power of fish
[91:35.19]It's mostly genetics.
[91:36.29]No, it's the power of omega-3 fatty acids in salmon and tuna.
[91:40.47]I love tuna fish.
[91:41.18]I love salmon.
[91:42.70]That's the power of the omega-3 fatty acids.
[91:56.92]Alright, I'm not going to miss anything.
[91:58.20]I'm locking in.
[91:58.99]I'm not going to talk.
[92:06.00]because every sentence I do, I end up messing up.
[92:17.26]No talking.
[92:41.36]That almost got me.
[92:47.58]There's three more levels after 3000 AD.
[92:49.23]That's fine.
[92:50.69]I'll be ready for them.
[92:58.59]Mmm.
[93:00.27]Hey, good looking.
[93:02.60]You're my kind of guy.
[93:06.00]Oh, how old are you?
[93:10.01]That fucking attacked me from my stomach.
[93:15.55]Somebody... Who did that?
[93:17.14]When did you, like, wish me upon that?
[93:19.70]Why would you use your wish, your star, like this shooting star wish on that?
[93:23.98]What is wrong with you?
[93:25.99]You could have wished for anything.
[93:29.13]Who looks out their window and sees a shooting star and goes, Make him burp!
[93:32.43]Make the streamer watching burp right now!
[93:35.12]What's wrong with you?
[93:35.83]You're a fucking weirdo.
[93:52.97]Got it.
[94:04.89]What would you wish for if you had a genie?
[94:06.27]World peace.
[94:10.65]VI, what would you wish for?
[94:12.35]Money or something?
[94:14.95]I would wish for world peace.
[94:18.09]What are you going to wish for?
[94:19.23]Oh, you wouldn't wish for that.
[94:20.84]I would.
[94:29.44]I'm better than you.
[94:57.12]The genie would give you a rock.
[94:58.58]Oh yeah, right, because that's like a piece of the world.
[95:01.55]And it would be like a slow zoom on my face, I'd be like realizing what I did.
[95:07.33]"'Oh, here you go.
[95:08.17]You said you wanted a world peace.
[95:10.45]Well, this rock is a piece of the world itself.'
[95:14.95]You should have asked for money.
[95:17.07]You should have asked for $1,000.
[95:44.47]It's not mirrored this time.
[95:45.57]It almost got me.
[95:54.12]Get away!
[96:04.14]Thought I fucked it up.
[96:06.84]I would wish for more time with our loved ones.
[96:09.73]Oh, what you didn't classify is the number one.
[96:12.46]I loved ones.
[96:14.04]So I'm going to give you one shoe and one sock and one eyeglass.
[96:17.78]And, uh, one, uh, one coffee cup and one, um, bedroom and one toilet and one, everything was one.
[96:25.58]Haha, see, you didn't classify everything.
[96:45.17]We'll be right back.

[97:17.08]Jump, Minnie!
[97:18.89]Watch out!
[97:19.48]Oh, don't do this when I'm fucking trying to get to the end of the game.
[97:24.77]You can't do a Mickey Mouse voice and play a game like this at the same time.
[97:38.76]Thermostreams are teens battling with adults.
[97:43.09]I don't know who's here.
[97:46.61]But shut up, all of you.
[97:48.49]500 AD.
[97:53.49]Alright, I'm good.
[97:59.64]I should be the only one talking.
[98:09.63]Chat is a chat room.
[98:12.79]It should be only me speaking.
[98:23.68]I pressed down.
[98:26.58]Why are there rails in 500 AD?
[98:33.30]They didn't have train tracks in 500 AD.
[98:46.92]OK. Not again!
[98:56.57]Oh my fingers were so slippery, I couldn't even do it.
[99:00.91]Alright, actually I have to pay attention.
[99:08.00]I wish I could make an air conditioner for where your hands grip the controller.
[99:11.82]Like vents with like fans in it.
[99:21.73]Take that!
[99:27.99]Not again!
[99:29.78]Good.
[99:30.97]Wipe your hands, it doesn't matter.
[99:33.90]If there were, on the back of this controller, right here, right?
[99:37.31]If there were, like, a vent...
[99:39.72]vent and there was two little, uh, intake fans maybe to like suck out the hot air from your hands.
[99:47.13]That'd be so sick.
[99:50.64]Alright, here we go.
[100:06.00]You could have like boost mode where you were really having trouble with like how sweaty you were.
[100:17.27]I pressed it.
[100:18.11]It just hit the corner.
[100:20.63]It hit the corner.
[100:39.14]Alright, jump.
[100:40.04]What was it?
[100:41.15]Jump into the helicopter, right?
[100:42.47]Yep.
[100:45.87]Does everybody want to kill TimeGal?
[100:48.81]She's just appearing in conflict periods of human history.
[100:53.79]I mean, if you were teleported in the middle of a battlefield
[100:56.69]It doesn't matter.
[100:57.39]I mean, you could be dressed, you could have like this outfit on.
[101:00.88]If I get teleported right now into the middle of like D-Day,
[101:04.50]with like a clown costume on guys, that's fucked up, right?
[101:07.59]Like it doesn't matter.
[101:09.88]If I get teleported into like the dinosaur period,
[101:14.36]and I have a clown costume on, it doesn't matter.
[101:17.09]It's not going to be like, oh, I shouldn't eat you, human.
[101:21.20]We're being teleported to periods of extraordinary conflict.
[101:35.52]Do you think the random scythe-wielding ghost, he was about to kill whatever was in front of him.
[101:42.71]What are you doing in my cemetery, clown?
[101:47.08]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[101:48.31]What are you doing in my cemetery, man from 1950?
[101:50.65]It doesn't matter.
[101:52.42]See?
[101:58.86]Yeah!
[102:04.54]Calm down.
[102:08.90]I know.
[102:09.14]I gotta fucking relax.
[102:11.47]I only have two more continues.
[102:19.14]Oh, God!
[102:30.45]No!
[102:31.39]No!
[102:33.34]No!
[102:44.27]I pressed two buttons at the same time.
[102:47.96]Let's shoot three times in a row.
[102:53.73]Thank God.
[103:11.11]Alright, this is it.
[103:12.91]1588.
[103:16.37]Only a few more.
[103:26.03]He was jumping to the ocean, right?
[103:35.58]Thank you.
[103:46.79]It was jumping to the ocean, right?
[103:49.76]What was it?
[103:50.11]What was it?
[103:50.45]What was it?
[103:50.99]The ship.
[103:51.43]Jump onto the ship.
[103:58.33]Okay, nice.
[104:10.55]Oh, well, this is three.
[104:11.78]This is the year 4000.
[104:19.42]This way!
[104:20.91]This way!
[104:21.87]This way!
[104:28.77]This way!
[104:29.41]Okay.
[104:38.44]Go up.
[104:39.17]I can't.
[104:39.65]Open the hatch.
[104:40.31]Shoot the enemy.
[104:40.90]Open the hatch.
[104:42.91]I can't move my arms.
[104:49.18]Whoa!
[104:53.96]Oh, hell yeah.
[104:54.80]That was a good, that's the first try.
[104:59.54]This way, this way.
[105:01.41]I can't do it.
[105:02.49]I can't.
[105:04.44]Don't shoot.
[105:04.92]That monster is your ancestor.
[105:08.95]Alright, 2001.
[105:11.33]Straight ahead.
[105:26.35]Oh, no!
[105:37.22]Alright, straight through.
[105:45.99]There's one or two more, and that's it.
[105:48.77]This might be the last one.
[105:51.93]Okay, here it is.
[105:55.04]What's the last one?
[105:55.78]4,000.
[105:59.89]Final boss.
[106:28.15]Yeah, I did it!
[106:29.45]Let's go!
[106:29.81]2010.
[106:48.19]Oh, my God.
[106:55.18]Oh, that one was...
[106:56.83]I thought it was going to be right.
[106:57.67]I thought it was going to be right.
[106:59.93]It's okay.
[107:00.23]We're good.
[107:11.43]I...
[107:38.36]Yeah!
[107:44.25]I cannot do another continue after this, right?
[107:46.99]3001?
[107:47.57]Didn't I already do 3001?
[108:05.38]Oh no, this is the tire screech that messed me up, right?
[108:25.14]Go up, go down, shoot the enemy.
[108:26.94]Go, uh, shoot the enemy, I know where to go, right?
[108:39.62]I'll do up.
[108:44.14]What are you talking about?
[108:45.14]The CD skipped and I couldn't do it!
[109:31.26]Okay, go up.
[109:35.04]That's all.
[109:35.28]This is it.
[109:44.44]I think I've seen them all.
[109:46.24]I think this is the last one.
[109:47.11]It has to be, right?
[109:50.40]What's the last level?
[109:51.22]4,001.
[110:10.09]What?
[110:15.41]Ahhh!
[110:36.94]Thank you.
[110:57.22]Okay, very important, very important.
[110:59.46]Wait, what?
[111:01.49]I didn't make that decision.
[111:14.06]What?
[111:24.54]I did it.
[111:26.49]Victory.
[111:29.70]Congratulations, you have saved mankind from a great crisis.
[111:33.45]The peaceful world is here to stay.
[111:35.68]Bless Time Girl.
[111:40.06]I love the little art in the lower right.
[111:43.64]Anime outro.
[111:49.20]Get a haircut.
[111:51.64]Hey, get a life.
[111:52.82]We're the only...
[112:00.73]Hold on.
[112:07.00]Get him.
[112:07.64]Get his ass.
[112:08.35]I didn't get his ass.
[112:09.11]I just told him to leave me alone.
[112:10.60]Stop being so mean.
[112:16.13]The music was actually good.
[112:17.19]The music was great.
[112:19.04]The music was really good.
[112:23.70]It's a glasses-off moment.
[112:28.63]SEGA CD programming.
[112:31.10]That one guy.
[112:34.56]That's a one guy moment.
[112:42.55]Wait.
[112:44.12]Fun fact.
[112:45.46]All of the lines in this game from the girl were ad-libbed from her just watching the scenes and making stuff up.
[112:50.52]It had no script.
[112:54.99]That's funny.
[112:57.88]Come and get me!
[112:59.49]Oh no!
[113:05.52]That's funny.
[113:07.35]Alright, the next one, this one's going to be interesting.
[113:10.63]We're going to slow it down a little bit.
[113:17.77]I'm going to take a quick pee break.
[113:22.25]And when I come back, we're going to play Jeopardy for the SEGA CD.
[113:25.70]Good luck to me.
[113:35.05]I'll be right back.
[113:36.79]I'll let the music stay on.
[113:37.66]Why not?
[113:43.37]I'll see you guys in...
[113:45.68]Wait, just in case there's like a after credits thing?
[113:52.95]Hmm?
[114:00.21]I don't think there is.
[114:04.36]That was great.
[114:04.79]I like that one a lot.
[114:07.25]They actually have been great.
[114:08.59]Batman and Robin was like a...
[114:11.09]It was charming in its own way, right?
[114:14.30]I liked it.
[114:15.18]I think it was worth playing.
[114:25.20]I was just saying enough for another second or two.
[114:27.41]Hold on.
[114:29.62]They might be like a thank you for playing.
[114:31.16]And it might be like a cute screen.
[114:39.24]No.
[114:43.24]Well, you guys can just whatever audio plays whatever you're getting.
[114:46.10]It's fine.
[114:50.57]It's probably going to be the theme song again.
[114:54.69]Oh, by the way, I had 386.
[114:56.72]Let's show it so people can see that I was in first place.
[115:01.50]See?
[115:02.40]First place.
[115:07.16]Alright, you guys can listen to whatever theme song plays.
[115:08.84]I'll see you guys in a little bit.
[115:10.33]Two, three minutes.
[115:13.70]game creative staff.
[117:49.05]game creative staff, Wolf Team.
[119:13.53]I have returned.
[119:16.03]Something very important for you to know for this next game for Jeopardy!
[119:21.60]This game came out.
[119:22.72]This is not Jeopardy now.
[119:25.88]I don't know.
[119:27.69]What was supposed to be a common knowledge thing for adults in 1993?
[119:32.05]I'm not going to get any of these questions correct.
[119:46.59]That's an excuse?
[119:49.07]No, that's a valid excuse, though.
[119:52.02]When this game came out, I, you know, I was like, what, 11?
[119:55.74]I was 11 years old.
[120:01.59]So I, I was, I didn't know what was going on.
[120:05.00]And then a decade later, you know, now, if this was like, if this released in like 2000,
[120:13.15]Maybe I'd have a chance.
[120:14.75]This is going to be talking about, like, things that the president did.
[120:18.46]Like, what did, like, in 1992 or whatever...
[120:22.62]Or like Congress, I don't know, we're gonna have to know some fucking names that I don't even care about.
[120:30.01]We're gonna get a pop pop culture from 1992.
[120:31.82]It's gonna be songs I don't know, don't remember.
[120:37.92]Alright, let's do it.
[120:39.85]Sorry, I'm going to cut this music off.
[120:42.89]I know a lot of you loved it.
[120:55.88]Is backseating allowed?
[120:57.00]I feel like backseating in a game show is just me showing how stupid I am.
[121:03.55]That's not really backseating as much as you either Googled the answer or you know the answer and I don't.
[121:09.38]Is that backseating or you just have more knowledge in your head?
[121:13.39]I think that half of you are full of shit though.
[121:14.98]So I don't think any of you know half the questions that are here.
[121:17.68]You're literally Googling it as fast again.
[121:26.42]Okay, let me just put my headphones back in.
[121:29.76]A headphone, more like it.
[121:42.38]What's your problem?
[121:45.36]How much time do you have?
[121:47.40]You know what I mean?
[121:50.01]What's up with you?
[121:50.90]I don't know, dude.
[121:51.36]How much time do you have?
[121:56.24]It's like, you know, that's a gritty response to that question.
[122:04.84]You know what I'm saying?
[122:08.68]Okay, hello.
[122:16.76]I might even just, you know, I might get my...
[122:20.12]I gotta get some more.
[122:20.84]The light is...
[122:21.76]There's so much light in this room right now already.
[122:25.17]Don't make any sense.
[122:27.10]Hold on.
[122:27.32]Give me one second.
[122:27.78]I want to try something.
[122:29.79]I want to try one thing before we go.
[122:47.23]Look at how bright this is in this room.
[122:52.05]Why is it doing this?
[122:55.30]I mean, that's better, but look at how dark it is.
[122:58.91]webcam crash out part two incoming alright well it's getting late it's fine
[123:08.26]Light a few candles.
[123:09.23]This room is bright.
[123:18.49]Turn on the lava lamp.
[123:24.60]What if I do this?
[123:26.24]Let me try something real quick.
[123:30.55]What if I turn the gain up in OBS on this camera?
[123:34.83]Will it be really ugly?
[123:47.65]That kind of works.
[123:48.75]It kind of looks like I'm in a Resident Evil game, though.
[123:54.86]Hey, look at that.
[123:57.87]Better.
[124:00.47]Night vision camera?
[124:03.57]Not if I do this.
[124:08.35]Alright, that eye looked weird now.
[124:16.53]Hold on.
[124:17.47]Watch this.
[124:20.05]boom fixed boom
[124:35.93]Alright.
[124:36.59]I'm just keeping it like this.
[124:37.68]I look like it's a Resident Evil game.
[124:38.88]Who cares?
[124:48.67]Yeah, that's fine.
[124:52.49]Okay, here comes Jeopardy.
[124:54.48]If you want to see what it looks like, here it is.
[125:02.00]And the whole thing is FMV, by the way.
[125:05.64]90s birthday home video.
[125:07.33]Yeah, we're just hanging out.
[125:10.02]Alright, let's read the back.
[125:11.51]Enormous database of answers and video footage.
[125:14.64]of Alex Trebek shot, especially for this game.
[125:17.41]So this is all original content with Alex Trebek.
[125:20.51]That's pretty cool.
[125:21.76]based on one of the most popular game shows in America.
[125:26.68]Why am I talking like you don't know what Jeopardy is?
[125:31.24]Stunning realistic graphics, CD quality theme music, and sound effects.
[125:38.25]I actually am excited for this one.
[125:39.63]I think this is going to be fun.
[125:41.15]And again, look at the pristine quality that SEGA cared about.
[125:44.62]Look at this.
[125:45.55]This is the kind of shit they don't do anymore.
[125:47.61]Look, look at this.
[125:48.24]Look at that, completely protected.
[125:53.14]Locked in there with foam padding.
[126:02.38]This is a serial killer tape.
[126:08.40]Look at my SEGA CD collection.
[126:11.42]No, sorry.
[126:13.19]No, I disagree completely.
[126:14.88]I'm sorry.
[126:17.11]Disagree.
[126:27.49]That's a full disagree.
[126:30.01]That meme is so old.
[126:31.15]Like, you guys still running with that shit?
[126:34.79]You guys are still running with that from, like, 2016?
[126:42.04]You guys aren't still running with that, are you?
[126:45.36]Come on, man.
[126:46.22]Come on, Gwen.
[126:51.11]Ah, fucking stupid thing!
[127:02.40]You haven't given us new content?
[127:05.48]That was your content!
[127:07.31]That was you guys doing that!
[127:09.93]I made a joke once in 2017.
[127:12.80]That's your content.
[127:14.34]Don't put that on me.
[127:16.59]Don't put that on me.
[127:24.61]We don't have anything to work with?
[127:25.63]What do you need to work with?
[127:29.53]Why don't you just watch the streams?
[127:31.66]What do you need to work with?
[127:35.51]Sit down and shut up.
[127:41.28]That's my fucking theory.
[127:45.92]I am like wicked green.
[127:55.46]Oh!
[128:07.59]Welcome, let's play Jeopardy.
[128:09.68]Let's play.
[128:10.22]Why was that sign so huge?
[128:17.28]Select game number one.
[128:18.62]One?
[128:19.08]One.
[128:21.49]How many players?
[128:23.06]Include computer contestants.
[128:25.40]I mean, three, right?
[128:26.15]You're gonna have three.
[128:28.21]Okay, who, select a personality.
[128:34.99]It's gonna be that guy.
[128:36.64]I feel like me and this guy connect right now.
[128:39.88]Please enter your name.
[128:43.55]I thought that was the name.
[128:46.02]I was like, what the fuck is this guy's name?
[128:48.67]Contestant number one is...
[128:50.39]I was like, there's no way.
[128:53.05]Why do I have a timer to put my name into Jeopardy?

[161:09.46]Yeah, Gog and Spike.
[161:19.09]Are they reindeers?
[161:20.02]I was going to say they're evil reindeers, but I feel like people would have gone, nah, that's not funny.
[161:27.41]What do I know?
[161:37.57]Turned it up.
[161:45.71]That was fucking loud.

[162:24.31]Look at how many cartoons we have to watch.
[162:29.28]Alright, I'm gonna say Spike.
[162:46.07]That's going to be annoying.
[163:01.36]I'd be pissed about this too!

[165:43.88]Okay, that was okay.
[165:44.99]I would give that one... That cartoon gets a 7.1.
[165:52.69]Let's watch GOG.
[166:04.50]I like the space intro.
[166:13.51]Come on.
[166:27.74]Just move out of the way.
[166:36.66]I don't know what to do.
[166:43.75]I think I'm going to have to go back.
[166:51.77]I don't know, what is this thing supposed to be?
[166:58.55]Are those his feet or are those hands?
[167:04.64]Okay, those are his hands.
[167:07.02]He has feet.
[167:10.41]Wait, why did we get a vroom vroom?
[167:14.41]We got the vroom vroom.
[167:18.72]Oh
[167:38.11]Why is he taking it and keeping it?
[167:40.40]What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
[167:46.54]He's collecting them.
[167:53.93]What the fuck?
[167:57.58]This dude's a little freak!
[168:03.38]That's his story?
[168:04.91]He just goes around and collects satellites that he's interested in?
[168:09.08]What the fuck is that?
[168:11.43]He gets a 2.
[168:12.56]That's a 2.0 out of 10.
[168:18.17]That's the whole story.
[168:18.97]That's his entire arc.
[168:24.21]Alright, what about Dash?
[168:29.56]Gog the Freak.
[168:33.86]We're watching all these, by the way.
[168:35.35]There's nothing to be said about it.
[168:40.16]This determines what character we're going to play as.
[168:51.36]Look at me, rich, hummock.
[168:55.54]I don't know, Jake.
[168:58.73]It's gonna open.
[168:59.80]I got just the thing, Mick.
[169:01.83]No walkies ever stop.
[169:03.44]Oh, Jakey boy, no sir.
[169:07.71]He kind of was doing Voldemort sounds.
[169:11.98]They're like...
[169:23.62]Ah, you don't want to mess with me, I'm the...
[169:26.63]I have arrived in the nick of time.
[169:29.16]Two cunning and deadly arch foes, and...
[169:32.21]Only I stand between them and their diabolical plot.
[169:38.90]Hounding!
[169:40.91]They fight heroically onward!
[169:44.60]We'll see!
[169:47.89]What about the dynamite?
[169:49.46]You gotta save the save.
[169:57.49]What is he doing to this guy?
[170:02.01]What is he doing to that guy?
[170:08.46]Or you won't hear the bang.
[170:12.89]Oops.
[170:15.33]Oh my god!
[170:27.77]He didn't do his job.
[170:29.88]I don't know what he did to that guy.
[170:32.53]I don't know if he shook him around and then he fucked it up.
[170:37.87]I'll give that one a 6.2.
[170:43.46]Alright, so far Spike is in the lead and I'm mad about that.
[170:47.28]Because as a character, I don't love him, but his story was more interesting than the other two.
[170:54.21]He's just a weirdo, right?
[170:55.68]He's just a weird person.
[170:57.75]So, that's the whole thing.
[170:59.71]I like the little back and forth, but I don't like him as a character.
[171:03.58]What about Chip?
[171:27.62]Is he fishing or is he going to be...
[171:29.41]He is fishing.
[171:39.47]I got a bike!
[171:40.26]I got a bike!
[171:48.38]You come back here, Mr. Bean!
[172:03.23]Are they conspiring against him now?
[172:12.12]Alright, we're getting Harry from Home Alone 1.
[172:20.35]There's a fart in this one.
[172:21.13]That's a full letter grade.
[172:26.77]He's gonna sink his own boat!
[172:34.80]Ow!
[172:35.98]If I was in the writer's room, that's what I would have done.
[172:38.22]And it's exactly what happened.
[172:39.14]This is an 8.2.
[172:49.90]Did they kill him?
[172:51.87]Does he die?
[172:52.42]Why is this so sad?
[172:55.05]He just died?
[172:56.25]He's drowning!
[172:57.80]Is he just drowned?
[173:00.40]They're playing with his lifeless body?
[173:06.43]Oh, thank God.
[173:11.32]Come on, cut it out!
[173:14.23]Let go of me!
[173:21.12]Okay, the ending of that, I don't...
[173:24.83]I'm not usually a fan of the, you know, the Looney Tunes circle is closing onto the main character.
[173:31.11]While something's chasing him and biting his bum and going like, whoa, get out of here.
[173:37.51]Oh, no, no, no.
[173:38.12]The circle closes.
[173:41.09]Oh, no.
[173:41.71]I don't think so.
[173:43.37]That was a good...
[173:44.82]I like the story.
[173:45.42]I like the two fishes.
[173:47.13]I think it was cute.
[173:51.44]Uh, I'm gonna go with, I'm gonna go with a, that was a 7.9.
[173:55.52]Chip is in the lead, let's do Zap.
[174:04.26]I have high hopes for this one.
[174:12.98]For my final act, I will need a magic... box.
[174:19.99]And a volunteer from the audience.
[174:22.35]I love the voice acting.
[174:27.10]Wait, that's Chip!
[174:33.10]I'm going to place you inside the magic box.
[174:40.96]And then I'm going to... Make me disappear?
[174:45.06]Yeah, yeah, I said, huh?
[174:45.98]You're gonna make me disappear?
[174:48.23]Go sit back down.
[174:49.00]You're way too into this.
[174:50.20]Let's get somebody that doesn't, uh, get off this.
[174:53.50]And this is the Swords of Death box trick.
[174:56.77]I don't want to do it.
[174:57.91]Nope, nope, not gonna do it.
[174:58.88]No way, Jose.
[174:59.52]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[175:00.80]Right you are.
[175:01.10]There's a bad new girl.
[175:02.95]Put me down.
[175:03.89]I don't want to.
[175:04.67]Put me down.
[175:06.15]I make a titanic leap.
[175:08.75]Oh!
[175:21.39]You killed him.
[175:28.11]Oops.
[175:30.30]I, um...
[175:36.76]Ah, that's a 9.
[175:39.00]That's a 9.0.
[175:39.78]He just killed somebody from the audience.
[175:42.84]That's it.
[175:43.68]And they did the circle close.
[175:46.40]But he just killed a member of the audience.
[175:49.83]Okay.
[175:50.33]Uh, I think Zap is...
[175:51.67]I like Zap.
[175:52.37]That was funny.
[175:53.63]How about Tank?
[176:05.92]Thank you.
[176:19.00]Let's just meet the soldier but with basketballs.
[176:29.57]Boy, you've got to... Yeah, those were quite the days.
[176:34.18]And we worked hard, mind you.
[176:35.69]And we loved it, too.
[176:37.11]So I remember once when I...
[176:39.52]what is going on
[176:52.15]Thank you.
[176:53.63]An armed grenade will explode in about 10 seconds.
[176:57.51]Amazing how focused your mind becomes.
[177:00.06]I remember once during the Great War, I was under attack.
[177:03.03]Or was it... Uh-oh...
[177:14.81]Troops dismissed.
[177:20.06]Okay, that's another just... murderer.
[177:23.55]That's the second murderer out of... okay.
[177:26.16]If you have your funny cast of characters...
[177:29.03]And what are there, 10 of them?
[177:30.54]20% are murderers, I don't know.
[177:41.61]Gog is also a murderer?
[177:44.40]Okay, that one was a seven.
[177:53.44]Your long journey to become master of Ninja 4
[177:58.18]Oh dear.
[177:59.30]Fierce as the dragon.
[178:04.94]Quick as the serpent.

[178:15.86]Yes, Master.
[178:17.53]Behold the deadly dragon wasp.
[178:20.56]Its venom is swift and always fatal.
[178:23.24]Victims of its sting swell up and die.
[178:25.85]Within moments.
[178:30.81]Great masters of Ninja Fool have proven their worth by capturing the beast with only Two Fingers.
[178:39.84]What grade are you gonna give this one?
[178:41.25]I don't know, wait for the cut, it's not over!
[179:03.80]Yeah!
[179:09.80]Yeah!
[179:11.75]Yeah!
[179:11.87]Yeah!
[179:14.64]Got it.

[179:19.47]Hold on.
[179:21.82]With Two Fingers or two hands.
[179:26.16]That's more murder.
[179:27.41]That's bug murder.
[179:42.06]I'd give that one a 5.0.
[179:55.12]I just joined- what the fuck?
[179:56.15]Alright, we got- there's only one more.
[179:57.19]This is- I got- I'm feeling this one's gonna be a big one.

[180:12.21]I give them like a 5.7.
[180:21.11]Hmm.
[180:28.81]Hmm.
[180:33.70]Murder.
[180:39.15]Murder incoming.
[180:51.77]No, this is a two.
[180:56.44]That snort is driving me insane.
[181:01.24]Thank you.
[181:11.78]Oh no!
[181:16.45]He's gonna get him!
[181:20.66]No, he's gonna have a change of heart at the very end.
[181:23.64]Yep.
[181:24.19]Okay, this is a seven.
[181:26.58]7.1 7.4 7.6
[181:38.43]8.5.
[181:42.39]Alright.

[181:58.71]Spike will...
[181:59.43]Okay, my top three were...
[182:01.82]Zap, Ug, and Spike.
[182:10.14]Okay, I'll go back.
[182:12.22]Oh, shit.
[182:12.83]I didn't want to do that.
[182:17.12]Let's do a poll in the chat.
[182:18.30]Yeah, that's fine.
[182:19.81]Who do you want?
[182:24.36]One player.
[182:24.98]Challenge or tournament?
[182:27.49]Challenge?
[182:29.49]Okay.
[182:30.64]Uh, do you guys want Ugg, Zap, or Spike?
[182:34.49]Okay, ug, zap, spike, gog, or chip?
[182:42.96]Those are the top five.
[182:49.02]I like this theme song.
[182:56.15]What ball we doing?
[183:03.56]Okay.
[183:05.31]It's gonna be a battle in chat, it looks like.
[183:19.93]It's close.
[183:21.01]It's actually closer than I thought it was gonna be.
[183:31.12]I think I know who it's gonna be.
[183:36.26]Dude, look at nobody voting for Spike.
[183:41.03]I guess nobody likes that character archetype.
[183:44.52]Just put words where I just did.
[183:53.51]Alright, let's do Zap.
[183:56.64]Zap versus, uh, can I pick this?
[184:00.38]Alright, what's the second one?
[184:01.96]Gog.
[184:04.11]Alright, let's do it.
[184:06.12]Choose a court.
[184:09.64]Um...
[184:12.17]I don't know.
[184:17.58]I said, what do I do?
[184:29.34]What's the- what is the game?
[184:39.09]Wait, do you have to score yourself in somebody's goal?
[184:46.58]How?
[185:04.02]How do I score myself?
[185:08.65]Alright, I got super boots.
[185:12.13]This music though is crazy.
[185:20.85]Am I winning?
[185:29.23]Is it like bunny hopping?
[185:36.65]Okay, if I was eight years old, and I was playing against my brother, and you just gave us two controllers,
[185:44.11]I think we would probably have a ton of fun because I don't think we would even care or know what we were doing.
[185:59.40]This is like the perfect game for a little kid, because like what even is happening right now?
[186:03.93]It's just...
[186:04.20]It's like, oh yeah, there's just sounds and stuff.
[186:07.28]And you just jump around.
[186:10.39]There's nothing else to this besides just kind of jump around, and I would be okay if my son was playing this.
[186:19.21]I can't seem to move that well.
[186:27.11]Are you trying to score each other?
[186:28.92]Hold on.
[186:33.01]How many points do I have?
[186:33.93]Wait, yeah, I'm supposed to be trying to score each other.
[186:45.54]Gog's son or... No, no, no, no, no.
[186:47.69]Bouncer's son or Jeopardy daughter?
[186:51.46]Oh my god, that's Bouncer's son for sure.
[186:54.80]Thought I'd have to spend one second on that.
[187:08.66]I mean, Bouncer's son could get like a D in math and science and stuff, but...
[187:14.69]I don't know.
[187:16.67]Do it again.
[187:20.95]I love the sound effects.
[187:22.97]You're down by 30 points?
[187:24.52]I don't understand the rules of the game.
[187:28.78]He's got 50 points!
[187:35.27]Oh, the game is called Bouncers!
[187:38.29]I don't think the goal matters, as long as you just get in one.
[187:52.95]I have a parachute.
[187:53.60]I think it's part of my magic.
[188:05.63]I thought this was gonna be like Smash Bros. What does the back of the box say?
[188:13.96]I wanna hear one more Stages song, you know what I mean?
[188:16.86]We're gonna try a different character.
[188:22.20]Alright, that's it.
[188:23.04]I lost by almost 100%.
[188:26.72]This is four quarters like a basketball game.
[188:35.78]Try to get a four pointer, that doesn't exist in basketball.
[188:44.07]I can come back.
[188:44.67]Somebody said, you're right.
[188:45.93]Don't just give up.
[189:03.41]Thank you.
[189:35.99]What the fuck, he just got 10 points!
[189:39.21]And he touched the stupid crystals!
[189:50.69]Get in!
[190:04.43]Gimme those!
[190:11.30]Gimme the Smash Balls!
[190:28.09]Again.
[190:29.93]I went through the circle up there, is that good?
[191:01.45]Get in!
[191:03.66]Get in!
[191:04.41]No!
[191:04.63]Give me those!
[191:15.74]That was Bouncers.
[191:17.53]And that came... Well, the cartoons were fun.
[191:20.08]I actually liked it.
[191:24.12]Alright, moving on.
[191:26.57]Uh, let's do this one.
[191:28.10]This one looks kind of like a game, like a video game.
[191:32.58]Oh, I know it's a video game.
[191:36.95]Let me do some cleaning up here.
[191:38.44]Hold on.
[191:40.73]Batman and Robin is in there.
[191:41.89]That's good.
[191:42.38]It's time, gal.
[191:49.56]You just rage quit bouncers?
[191:51.81]That's fine.
[191:52.50]We got a lot to get through.
[191:58.92]That game had a stacked voice acting cast.
[192:05.51]Mark Hamill was Dash.
[192:09.20]John Kassir was little kid and Jake.
[192:14.47]Michael Bell was, was Mick?
[192:18.71]John Kassir was Gog?
[192:25.57]Okay.
[192:29.69]That's a monster cast.
[192:34.33]There's a bouncer's emote in chat.
[192:36.12]See, that's crazy.
[192:37.60]Everything, it could exist for everything.
[192:42.58]Is there actually somebody... Oh, don't drop it.
[192:44.73]That's...
[192:45.51]I love that.
[192:48.08]Is there actually a Bouncer's emote, or did somebody just make it in BTTV?
[192:52.30]And put it up here.
[192:56.60]TimeGal was so much fun.
[192:57.83]That was fun too.
[192:58.49]That was cute.
[192:59.01]I liked it.
[193:00.99]We got to watch cartoons for like 20 minutes.
[193:02.74]That was fun.
[193:05.91]Alright, this next one's called Battle Corps.
[193:08.66]And this looks like a game.
[193:10.06]Like a gamer game.
[193:19.52]Battle Corps.
[193:23.47]Or Battle Corp.
[193:27.82]It's got some crazy artwork on the front.
[193:35.87]Like it says, it says, get this on the back.
[193:40.64]You see the guy?
[193:46.70]Battle Corp.
[193:49.03]says, get this, take control in this high-tech tactical blast fest that keeps on blasting.
[193:55.84]Keep those plasma cannons charged
[193:58.21]or you'll never make it through the multitude of 3D terrains.
[194:02.52]on your final showdown with the cyber psychotic boss on the terrifying 13th mission.
[194:11.24]Electronic Gaming Monthly, this is EGM, said, this first core game is an incredible mech simulation game.
[194:20.54]entitled battle corpse like a real statement that was that's a statement on the back of the box
[194:32.52]Your camera's fucked up.
[194:33.65]I noticed.
[194:38.39]The control in Battle Corp is awesome...
[194:42.60]This gives the game a very realistic feel.
[194:46.58]Okay.
[194:48.49]This one broke in half.
[194:55.13]You look like you're going through a codec call.
[194:59.71]Snake, if you use the crouch button, you can get underneath that vent.
[195:07.92]Also, did you know that you can jump while you're running?
[195:14.88]Oh, I fucking keep doing it.
[195:27.36]SEGA.
[195:32.36]Oh, you guys can't hear it.
[195:33.41]I'm going to get fucking... People are going to be pissed about that.
[195:42.70]Minecraft Creeper POV.
[195:44.61]Let's go.
[195:45.23]This is crunchy.
[195:51.24]core design limit I'm gonna be so I gotta get dude I need something attached to my face
[195:56.29]I'm getting rid of the professional microphone shit.
[195:58.46]I'm just gonna have one of those goofy, like, televangelist microphones right here.
[196:02.11]I'm done.
[196:03.40]That's it.
[196:18.21]I can't read that.
[196:19.27]Interplanetary Mining Corporation?
[196:20.94]Huh?
[196:29.48]First, a little background of the sorry situation we find ourselves in.
[196:39.30]Mandelbrot's world, eight light years from Earth in the Capella star system.
[196:48.55]I can't hear anything.
[196:55.28]Ugh.
[197:00.44]Somebody tell him the microphone is not plugged in correctly.
[197:04.73]The music's too loud.
[197:13.98]And it's your job to go down there and meet and greet them.
[197:17.18]Basically, we want you to blow the suckers away.
[197:21.13]I can't hear anything.
[197:27.02]Who's that guy?
[197:33.03]Jack Cutter.
[197:40.47]I feel like I'm ordering something at McDonald's.
[197:49.48]Yeah, I'll take a number two, please.
[197:52.37]With extra onions.
[197:57.75]He's a heavy hitter, and any firefighter's world is waiting for him.
[198:02.38]Here's your hardware, sweet pea.
[198:03.91]The Armadillo-class bipedal attack machine was kept on two legs with enough heavy ordnance to burn a big hole in the final exchange point.
[198:12.27]but it ain't gonna be easy.
[198:15.05]You got 12 heavily-dependent sectors to clear before you reach Moses with a form like good old lasers of body and a solid form of silver.
[198:21.31]Oh, I heard let's go kick some butts.
[198:27.71]Have a nice day.
[198:28.65]Alright, let's go kick some butt.
[198:32.18]Is this gonna be a crappy fighting game?
[198:33.77]This is a first-person shooter.
[198:38.87]That was outrageous.
[198:42.12]Mark Hamill did not voice act in this game.
[198:46.40]Allegedly, that's what they're saying in the chat room.
[198:52.14]Battle Corp. From SEGA and Core Design Limited.
[199:07.95]Easy A on.
[199:11.05]Alright, let's go.
[199:13.53]Start game.
[199:15.48]I'm ready.
[199:24.37]Please don't be loud.
[199:26.46]Please don't be loud.
[199:29.60]Our core design limited.
[199:31.07]Okay, what is going on?
[199:33.02]What why do they put in their game studio?
[199:36.66]Why is the logo for the game company right here?
[199:46.12]Dick is a gene-spliced polymorph with a download in Cyberpsychosis.
[199:51.33]He's a heavy hitter, and in a firefight he's worth his weight in ordnance.
[199:56.42]It sounds like Beetlejuice.
[199:58.57]I'm just waiting for him to say, nice fucking model.
[200:06.68]Select a gun jock?
[200:11.89]Jack Cutter.
[200:13.78]Jack's got ten years in the Corps, five of them as a cyber-formed gun jock.
[200:18.68]his bioware has got more edges than a battlescape polyhedron okay look at speed armor and power is anybody better than this guy
[200:28.85]Wait, I can play as Core Design Limited.
[200:38.61]Do I fly around as a logo?
[200:51.85]Okay, sweetie.
[200:53.99]Let's get down to business.
[200:55.64]You got 12.
[200:56.69]Count up.
[200:57.17]12.
[200:57.47]sectors to blast through before you make that date with Moses.
[201:01.71]First up is sector lady one and she's real hot laying in a bed of old lava.
[201:07.41]There's an infected radar cluster at the far end of the sector.
[201:10.77]Your job is to take it out before you advance to the elevator.
[201:15.56]Download cyber form Jack Cutter.
[201:18.28]Caldry out.
[201:21.39]That was the cyber briefing.
[201:29.37]That's going to be you with your new mic.
[201:30.92]Good.
[201:31.25]That's what I want.
[201:38.09]Okay, that was the cyber briefing.
[201:41.63]Alright, so what about attend briefing?
[201:45.85]What about this one?
[201:46.64]Becky Ogre.
[201:47.36]Speed.
[201:48.35]Becky's a pumped up kickboxer from the corporate barrio.
[201:53.31]has a pulse of batter than a Yakuza hitster.
[201:58.42]Okay, I get the pop filter.
[202:01.30]That happens to me too.
[202:02.66]Happens to all of us.
[202:05.98]Who should I be?
[202:06.79]Jack Cotter.
[202:08.67]Jack's got ten years in the Corps.
[202:11.84]I think I want the speed.
[202:14.03]Speed sounds good.
[202:18.79]He's a heavy hitter, and in a firefight, he's worth his weight in ordinance.
[202:24.24]Alright.
[202:24.52]We're going to be Deco.
[202:29.42]Ten years at the core.
[202:30.89]Stage one.
[202:41.42]Please don't be loud.
[202:49.33]I'm gonna turn it down preemptively just in case.
[202:54.67]CD quality audio?
[202:57.32]Maybe?
[202:57.64]Ooh.
[202:58.20]Okay.
[203:06.67]You're up by attention.
[203:18.16]Okay, I got lasers.
[203:21.21]This is so loud.
[203:25.16]He's running down Elmer Lane here, down that tunnel, ma'am.
[203:29.71]He's selling hot dogs, all sectors.
[203:31.11]He's hitching a ride out of there.
[203:32.42]Recommend we put up a mushroom or send in the core for immediate extraction.
[203:37.38]Repeat, this is a code 1096.
[203:41.33]Alright, let's go.
[203:42.76]He said it's a code 109er.
[203:51.94]There's that CD quality audio.
[203:59.64]Mine detected.
[204:15.26]Easy.
[204:17.52]Oh, I got missiles too.
[204:22.80]Pokeballs?
[204:25.17]Triple Pokeball.
[204:37.57]Alright, this one's good.
[204:39.55]This has got a good written all over it.
[204:48.83]That's a mine, don't step it.
[204:56.65]I'm happy there's an indicator of where to go.
[205:02.89]Is this burning?
[205:04.41]Oh, this burns you.
[205:05.94]Whatever, we're fine.
[205:07.47]Wait, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[205:09.02]Stop, stop, stop.
[205:09.50]It actually might burn me to death.
[205:24.84]Flamethrower.
[205:26.60]Alright, let's just go fast and just try to get over it.
[205:38.56]Am I going the right way?
[205:55.79]Nice, alright.
[205:58.12]This way.
[205:59.58]I'm gonna get burnt.
[206:00.81]Do I have burned preventative shoes?
[206:10.79]Heat warning, heat warning, heat warning.
[206:12.64]Alright, well, don't tell me the indicator.
[206:14.55]Do I have jump jets?
[206:17.36]I don't think so.
[206:29.96]Is there health anywhere?
[206:43.00]These things are all shooting at me!
[206:51.07]Holy shit.
[206:59.58]I don't know.
[207:01.89]This is MechWarrior at home.
[207:03.78]Did this come out before MechWarrior?
[207:06.25]It might have.
[207:10.63]We gotta try a different character.
[207:14.17]I think the speed is what the problem was.
[207:18.21]Health bar is bottom right.
[207:20.38]Do I need like heat resistant legs?
[207:29.17]Oh, my eyes are like watering.
[207:32.90]Too many explosions.
[207:43.32]Okay.
[207:48.87]It said get to the 13th level to fight the absolute... Look at how much faster this is.
[207:52.70]This is so much better.
[207:55.48]I like this weapon better.
[208:03.87]We can just speedrun this whole thing, right?
[208:07.75]She's the fast character, we can just go.
[208:11.73]Now we're going to come up to our last station, right out of Brooklyn.
[208:23.17]I'm gonna die in five minutes.
[208:44.32]Why are you so locked in?
[208:50.96]I don't know, dude.
[208:51.92]I'm digging it.
[208:59.05]Get out of the fire!
[209:00.12]I don't think I have a jump.
[209:11.15]Vibes are good with this one.
[209:12.96]Now, this is a strong vibe game.
[209:14.34]It is.
[209:15.43]I'm going to die, but we're going to move on from this one.
[209:18.80]But the vibes were definitely there.
[209:20.75]100%.
[209:26.66]This isn't your top 250.
[209:29.69]No.
[209:31.97]But it's not in my bottom 250.
[209:37.31]There's something so interesting about a game that looks like this and the music that sounds like that.
[209:40.92]I know.
[209:41.70]It's weird.
[209:44.27]Okay, let's...
[209:46.96]I'm going to take another pee break.
[209:52.02]I'll take another pee break.
[209:52.98]I'll be back.
[209:53.60]We'll do maybe like one or two more.
[209:55.95]Jack Cutter.
[209:57.80]Jack's got ten years in the Corps.
[210:00.19]Five of them as a side-performing gun-job.
[210:02.67]It's on par with MechWarrior on SNES.
[210:05.10]Think about when this came out.
[210:07.63]That actually was pretty great for how long ago this was.
[210:12.39]So I think that was it.
[210:14.30]The vibes are good on that one.
[210:16.70]I know I'm going to run into a wall over and over again, trying to get past that level, but that was a good one.
[210:20.62]I liked that one.
[210:23.48]Alright, I'll be back.
[210:26.91]I'll leave you with the SEGA CD music.
[210:29.12]Because why not?
[211:03.77]you
[211:30.12]you
[212:21.48]you
[213:38.62]you
[214:32.30]you
[214:56.28]you
[215:20.88]you
[215:32.96]have returned.
[215:36.88]Next one coming up is called Brutal Paws of Fury.
[215:44.12]This one looks like a fighting game, but it has cutscenes.
[215:52.75]We'll find out.
[215:58.82]Looks pretty good.
[216:12.43]Every time you come back from a break, it jumps me.
[216:15.83]Okay, maybe I'll put text on the screen that says he is arriving.
[216:24.15]Would that be helpful?
[216:28.67]He is arriving now.
[216:44.99]or refuse to come back from BRB until a certain amount of subs are hit.
[216:58.20]Brutal.
[216:59.06]Paws of Fury.
[217:00.73]Looks pretty cool.
[217:03.63]I know it's hard to see, but I can assure you it's cool.
[217:09.07]I guess you can play as a bear.
[217:17.08]A lion, there's a tiger, there's a bunny rabbit.
[217:21.02]Someone said this game stinks.
[217:23.57]You don't even know that, you haven't even played it.
[217:28.59]You haven't even seen it.
[217:30.86]This is a nerd game?
[217:33.46]What is a non-nerd game?
[217:36.55]Is my question for you.
[217:46.11]Madden.
[217:49.42]Okay.
[217:52.78]Okay.
[217:54.33]Now you got me fine.
[218:00.50]Crazy intro.
[218:09.34]I love how they all started with these.
[218:11.52]It's almost like 3D movie maker splash screens at the beginning of every game.
[218:18.07]It's like when 3D was first possible, people were just taking cubes and shrinking and growing them in Blender.
[218:42.91]Brutal.
[218:45.36]Inside of my ear is so itchy right now.
[218:50.48]Oh, that's so much better.
[218:54.10]1994, Game Tech.
[218:55.85]Why is it familiar?
[219:00.17]What's Game Tech?
[219:03.22]Alright.
[219:04.66]The fun room.
[219:08.14]Look at options.
[219:09.16]Music on.
[219:10.23]Timer on.
[219:10.81]Number of players.
[219:11.47]Difficulty level.
[219:12.52]That's fine.
[219:14.60]This is all fine.
[219:21.37]I like the no frills head to head start game.
[219:23.62]Alright, this is a very important decision.
[219:27.05]Across the globe, invitations were delivered.
[219:38.26]Is he eating a lettuce sandwich?
[219:50.81]What's wrong with him?
[220:00.35]This is like 500 FPS.
[220:06.93]We're so used to seeing 12 FPS that seeing anything close to 60 is weird on this console.
[220:19.79]Whoa, I don't like that face.
[220:22.73]That was a weird face.
[220:25.17]That was when Jim Carrey does the Grinch face.
[220:27.96]You've never seen him do that without the makeup on?
[220:29.55]That was the out-of-makeup Jim Carrey Grinch.
[220:32.94]That was fucking weird.
[220:38.28]Okay, welcome to Brutal Island.
[220:44.10]Are we the bear?
[220:44.84]Or are we going against the bear?
[220:58.80]This game's pretty sick.
[221:00.25]I don't know.
[221:00.72]This one's up there pretty high for the collection, I think.
[221:03.23]I got high hopes.
[221:19.17]Where are we?
[221:22.97]Doesn't that happen at the beginning of Myst?
[221:28.91]This is the mist intro.
[221:35.78]What is he doing?
[221:42.64]Okay, select new character.
[221:48.57]Enter your name.
[221:49.47]Okay.
[221:52.12]How about me?
[222:01.49]Alright, we got Kung Fu Bunny.
[222:05.24]Whatever is a yearbook quote?
[222:07.05]To no fear is courage.
[222:09.22]Relaxed paw, 5'10".
[222:11.97]Weight, 100 pounds.
[222:14.27]background, spent 15 years in a Shaolin temple studying the art,
[222:20.19]There's too much text on the screen here.
[222:22.46]There are set news... What is that down here?
[222:24.43]However, you have difficulty making personal decisions and keeping...
[222:30.59]them.
[222:31.15]Your desire to help others comes from your favorite attack is the Toby
[222:38.21]Desire for someone else to give your life direction.
[222:46.55]Alright, Leon.
[222:48.60]Prince Leon of Kenya.
[222:51.64]Who plays Leon?
[222:52.61]You never forget a debt for right or wrong.
[222:56.24]You stop at nothing to even up the score.
[223:02.62]Your willpower is indomitable.
[223:06.06]but you find it difficult to focus on more than one thing at a time.
[223:14.13]This might be me.
[223:15.88]Dude, this is actually kind of me.
[223:17.76]That's me.
[223:18.29]That's my I'm Leon.
[223:21.85]A Thai cheetah.
[223:24.41]Who plays Thai cheetah?
[223:26.86]You are devoted to Taos.
[223:31.07]Oh, those who are close to you.
[223:34.31]Yet you are cold and unfeeling to those who you regard as enemies.
[223:40.22]Interesting.
[223:42.10]Your abilities are second to none and yet you lack the self-motivation to excel.
[223:53.04]Often you are happy with your lot and see no need to change.
[224:03.40]The rat.
[224:04.89]Who plays the rat?
[224:07.48]You despise fools.
[224:10.20]You want them to be humiliated.
[224:13.98]You are the one who can stand up to the bullies and shame them.
[224:22.13]You find...
[224:23.23]This is just chat.
[224:24.98]You find it difficult to make friends.
[224:30.47]That was not a lot.
[224:31.38]I...
[224:32.61]That... And your cringe!
[224:34.48]And your cringe!
[224:35.03]It said your cringe down there!
[224:38.25]This is you guys.
[224:42.99]I didn't know I was gonna read that next part!
[224:48.72]You know the game.
[224:50.90]There are leaders and followers.
[224:54.78]Okay, most people are honest, hard workers.
[225:00.37]willing to put in a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.
[225:07.44]You are a leader.
[225:10.31]These people will work for you and the rewards
[225:15.62]shall be yours.
[225:17.05]Okay?
[225:19.25]You know people better than they know themselves.
[225:25.16]No matter what they may say, you know they respect the stern leader.
[225:34.38]Okay.
[225:34.46]What about the coyote?
[225:39.40]Good.
[225:39.76]No matter what happens,
[225:44.31]This is just what I say into the mirror every day.
[225:53.93]and setback merely makes you seek another solution.
[226:02.74]Your confidence makes you reckless.
[226:06.45]You indulge yourself totally and never cheat.
[226:11.41]I don't.
[226:12.50]Yourself of any pleasure.
[226:14.40]Also true.
[226:16.02]I might be the coyote.
[226:18.53]How about Foxy Roxy?
[226:22.06]Foxy Roxy, you are a capricous and playful soul who loves to see joy and happiness.
[226:32.15]you are unable to take anything seriously for too long.
[226:39.21]However, then you also have a strong need for diversion.
[226:46.34]Uh-oh.
[226:49.87]I might be a Foxy Roxy.
[226:54.32]Or Ivan.
[227:03.54]I just, I gotta, I gotta, what's, I gotta ask, what's with the boobs up at the chin?
[227:06.89]You know what I'm saying?
[227:07.53]I, that's, I just gotta ask.
[227:08.71]What's going on?
[227:09.84]What's going on with these?
[227:11.14]Because they're up here.
[227:12.04]This is their upper chin.
[227:13.99]Their chin is being covered by them.
[227:15.58]What's going on?
[227:16.25]Put the boobs under the chin.
[227:26.08]Okay, who plays Ivan?
[227:29.11]You're a down-to-Earth kind of person who stands for no nonsense.
[227:38.56]Almost any problem can be overcome by a bit of common sense.
[227:45.49]Just a little bit of common sense and hard work.
[227:48.76]This is the politician one.
[227:50.23]You hate to sit still for any length of time.
[227:52.74]That's just common sense.
[227:54.06]and you are unable to see way.
[227:58.52]Some people want to do nothing.
[228:00.61]What is it saying?
[228:02.01]All the time.
[228:02.84]I don't even know what that just said.
[228:07.33]Alright, I've made my decision.
[228:08.64]It's either Leon or...
[228:12.32]Uh, the coyote.
[228:14.87]I think I'm going with the coyote.
[228:16.34]Or Foxy Roxy.
[228:18.79]I can't make this a poll because I know it's going to be like 98% Foxy Roxy.
[228:22.61]So we might as well just play as the one that you guys are going to pick anyways.
[228:33.15]Here we go.
[228:40.52]Okay, head-to-head.
[228:41.41]Win.
[228:42.13]Okay, I'm gonna...
[228:44.06]Perfect record.
[228:45.29]Head-to-head fight.
[228:47.28]Let's go.
[228:52.11]Wait, what's going on?
[228:53.51]This is my karma?
[229:01.45]How do I start?
[229:03.14]You are now a white belt.
[229:05.37]Your current password is that.
[229:06.64]You have no special moves.
[229:10.96]Beaver Spurs' butthead.
[229:12.57]I'm just waiting for one of them to go, heh, heh, heh, heh.
[229:22.44]Yeah.
[229:27.17]Scene one, the landing.
[229:40.68]Round one, go.
[229:45.18]Damn!
[229:53.03]Hypebeast!
[230:12.64]Come on!
[230:23.05]Yeah!
[231:02.25]Why do I only have one kick?
[231:04.11]Do I not have any moves?
[231:05.40]He just puked!
[231:43.85]I did a hundred and s- I don't have any ki- I only have kicks!
[231:49.30]A hundred and six ki-
[231:55.46]How do you punch?
[232:07.90]Try pressing a different button.
[232:09.00]Dude, there are three on this controller.
[232:13.94]There are three buttons.
[232:16.05]There is only one of three options.
[232:32.91]I got it.
[232:35.84]You might need the six button pad for this.
[232:37.70]What?
[232:39.43]That was on the Genesis and the SEGA CD?
[232:40.79]I thought that was Saturn.
[232:53.53]What?
[233:20.26]This dude is just puking every second.
[233:32.61]Got him.
[233:35.56]Alright, we're good.
[233:37.93]Quarter circle forward is punch.
[233:42.62]Maybe try pressing start.
[233:47.22]Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[233:48.65]Start switches from... Start is how you switch.
[233:53.23]They're different.
[233:53.90]That's weird.
[233:59.32]Go!
[234:00.39]Go!
[234:01.02]Go!
[234:02.24]Go!
[234:04.94].
[234:05.44].
[234:14.92]Come on.
[234:30.68]Thank you.
[234:37.98]Fuck!
[234:41.97]Hey!
[234:53.17]Please, please.
[235:00.88]Hey.
[235:15.77]Bye.
[235:23.43]Bye.
[235:25.98]Bye.
[235:30.97].
[235:31.76].
[235:32.72].
[235:44.54]Let's go!
[235:57.82]Alright, I'm 1-1.
[236:05.13]I wonder how you do a throw.
[236:10.53]How do you block?
[236:18.19]I forgot to blink.
[236:21.97]Okay, Tai Chida knelt down and prepared himself for the journey home.
[236:26.51]It would be good to see his family again.
[236:28.26]He had won many...
[236:30.17]things but he had lost his pupil okay hold the back button it didn't seem like it did anything
[236:39.87]Alright, versus the rat.
[236:43.63]What is this karma?
[236:47.42]I think I can make the fight harder.
[236:55.72]Alright, let me try the other character.
[236:59.78]Coyote, right?
[237:21.94]I'm streaming from the central reactor at Chernobyl.
[237:25.79]Okay.
[237:32.02]That's straight up the early 90s furry art style that you'd see on BBSs.
[237:50.16]Good luck fighting this.
[237:56.02]Oh, you can do a karate chop.
[238:10.30]I gotta get that quadruple punch in the face.
[238:22.64]I love how it just pitch-tips.
[238:24.09]It sounds like he's talking sometimes.
[238:29.72]Draw!
[238:30.14]Draw!
[238:30.26]Draw!
[238:30.76]Draw!
[238:37.76]Got him.
[238:43.65]Block sweep?
[238:49.44]Dude, we're just going for the WWF karate chop to the face.
[238:52.03]To the chest, I mean.
[238:55.86]It's one of those powerful things in wrestling.
[239:05.47]What is he doing to me?
[239:08.68]He just killed me instantly.
[239:09.70]That was an instant KO.
[239:13.31]What just happened to me?
[239:18.36]My health just drained, that was weird.
[239:31.25]Stop!
[239:38.98]Stop!
[239:40.38]Caught him in the corner.
[239:41.15]That's a bad place to be.
[239:49.80]He hits so hard.
[239:56.36]Why does he hit so fucking hard?
[240:00.80]He's gaining health.
[240:02.98]How is he gaining health?
[240:05.62]That's...
[240:20.28]We're going with the real character.
[240:28.80]Oh, chat just beat your ass?
[240:30.93]Yeah, you got a heal hack.
[240:32.96]You got cheats.
[240:46.35]I feel like this guy's a mage.
[241:00.88]I was trying quarter.
[241:02.40]It said you didn't know any moves.
[241:04.94]Let me try quarter circle B, quarter circle A, quarter circle C. I tried it a few times.
[241:24.54]Doesn't seem to do anything.
[241:26.04]Quarter circle, back circle.
[241:30.71]Like, down, down, left, left, right.
[241:33.14]I don't think so.
[241:36.82]Two at the same time maybe?
[241:37.85]No.
[241:43.14]The rat is kind of crazy.
[241:54.51]It said you had no special move.
[241:55.93]Yeah, I think I have to learn them.
[241:59.13]You probably get skill points or something weird, which is kind of crazy for a game that came out this long ago.
[242:06.30]I see the vision.
[242:07.42]This game's good.
[242:08.97]This is a good one.
[242:15.70]Turn that lava lamp on?
[242:17.52]Uh...
[242:18.04]I will.
[242:19.98]Just give me a minute.
[242:26.26]Can't do anything.
[242:30.19]That move is such horseshit.
[242:31.39]That move sucks.
[242:45.20]Let him come to me.
[242:46.52]I'm not going over there.
[243:01.67]In what way does a rat have more reach than a panther?
[243:29.85]Go!
[243:42.98]Yes!
[243:44.45]No!
[244:01.59]Yeah!
[244:02.53]Something's just gotta go in.
[244:18.25]Shamed and defeated, he would give his opponent no glory.
[244:29.17]Dude, this fighting game sucks.
[244:31.74]Stop.
[244:35.47]Alright, I gotta set up for this one.
[244:39.49]Special move, taunt.
[244:46.97]Uh...
[244:49.45]My special move is showing my flashing somebody?
[244:53.43]That's my move?
[244:55.44]Brutal.
[244:59.89]Brutal.
[245:00.81]You just learned a crime.
[245:09.56]Okay.
[245:14.81]Alright, I guess I can do that now.
[245:24.52]Oh wait, the special move was only for that character.
[245:26.49]That's... Oh shit, I didn't know that.
[245:30.33]Thought it was for everybody.
[245:40.18]I just got the biggest craving in the world.
[245:43.79]But I'm not going to act on it.
[245:46.13]But man, it hit pretty hard right there.
[245:50.11]I just had this insane craving.
[245:52.50]And I've had it recently.
[245:53.65]Like, within the last few weeks.
[245:57.16]Or what, the last couple months maybe?
[245:58.38]I don't remember.
[246:01.02]Oh man, a nice like big tuna sub.
[246:07.14]I just like, I take, I already lost.
[246:12.63]A big tuna sub.
[246:17.65]Big piece of Swiss cheese on it or something and like lettuce.
[246:21.77]I'm talking about an extra large.
[246:31.58]There's another Grinch back there.
[246:32.80]There's a Grinch face.
[246:34.73]I'm telling you, that's the Grinch face from Jim Carrey's The Grinch.
[246:42.44]This guy is way harder than everything else.
[246:58.49]I forget I'm dealing with a 40 year old what do you mean you're dealing with a 40 year old
[247:07.01]I'm dealing with a 40 year old.
[247:08.61]What do you mean I'm dealing with a 40 year old?
[247:14.81]green peppers, black olives, and Italian herbs and cheese bread.
[247:16.87]That sounds kind of good.
[247:18.80]Alright, I'll do one more with the rat.
[247:26.22]Hey, big fan of your work.
[247:27.24]Hey, you know what?
[247:28.33]Thanks.
[247:32.27]Welcome to the stream.
[247:33.27]What's up?
[247:39.35]How are you?
[247:41.54]I'm going to put work and then a question mark.
[247:44.25]Yeah, whatever.
[247:46.82]You've seen my work.
[247:53.81]Why do you have a green fart cam?
[247:55.66]Why don't you just change the color?
[248:01.30]Go to your...
[248:02.36]It's your computer.
[248:04.22]Go to your monitor's menu and change the color to make it correct.
[248:09.89]Here we go.
[248:15.91]Go dodge.
[248:17.30]The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[248:34.38]Good air denial.
[248:35.50]Good air defense.
[248:41.77]Air denial.
[248:42.31]Good job.
[248:49.11]It's not a ground game.
[248:50.19]It's not a ground game.
[248:50.96]Get up in the air.
[248:52.01]It's not a ground game.
[248:52.79]It's not your ground game.
[248:53.86]Get in the air.
[248:58.57]He didn't even touch me.
[249:12.99]What the fuck?
[249:22.87]Alright, Kazooie.
[249:25.01]Get back in the backpack.
[249:38.60]Embarrassing.
[249:41.30]Alright, one more try.
[249:42.04]I unlocked a move for a character.
[249:43.85]I'm going to use it.
[249:54.23]Watch this dude 10% of his health every 10 seconds, every time I do it.
[249:58.89]I'm five and 10.
[249:59.93]Have I played that many matches?
[250:03.93]What do you mean?
[250:04.48]I learned special moves.
[250:08.93]What?
[250:11.81]It resets the whole idea.
[250:13.28]It's a roguelike.
[250:19.18]It's a roguelike fighting game.
[250:29.46]Alright, this one was great though.
[250:30.83]I like the vision.
[250:32.36]This goal, I think we got some giggles out of it.
[250:33.91]We got some laughs.
[250:36.16]Now the question is, do I do one more, or do I go get a big-ass tuna sub?
[250:42.58]Hmm...
[250:46.27]One more.
[250:49.89]One more.
[250:51.82]This is one that I've done before, but it's crazy and I want to see if I can get through it.
[251:06.79]Can I pause the game?
[251:09.58]This one is an interesting one because this one is...
[251:12.12]So the SEGA 32X was another peripheral that you plugged into the top of the SEGA Genesis.
[251:19.57]And you could plug a cartridge into...
[251:22.20]So SEGA Genesis took, obviously, cartridges.
[251:25.08]And...
[251:26.50]This plugged into the cartridge slot, which then had its own cartridges that went into that extra cartridge slot.
[251:35.16]I don't have the 32X because that's terrible and there's like eight games for it.
[251:40.44]And none of them are good.
[251:41.84]I think there's like a Sonic and Knuckles game for the 32X that is even worth playing.
[251:48.49]And I actually genuinely mean that.
[251:51.22]There's like maybe 10 to 15 games on the whole thing.
[251:54.74]But, weirdly enough...
[251:57.53]The SEGA CD also had a thing called 32X CDs.
[252:03.64]which if you had a 32X plugged in, and you had a SEGA CD plugged in to your Genesis,
[252:09.67]You could do...
[252:11.76]There's like three games that were SEGA 32X CDs.
[252:16.04]This is one of them.
[252:19.29]It's a firefighter game.
[252:22.19]And to see that SEGA 32X CD, it comes with both.
[252:26.26]You get the SEGA CD and you get the 32X CD.
[252:29.85]It's a double CD.
[252:31.78]It's one of, I think, two or three games that actually had it.
[252:36.45]I played this seven or eight years ago.
[252:39.91]I don't remember much about it, but I did, I was like, you know what, we gotta go, if we're gonna do the whole collection, we gotta do the whole collection, right?
[252:47.98]So let me turn this off.
[252:52.28]Do I want a 30?
[252:52.94]I don't really want a 32X.
[252:54.32]I really don't.
[253:02.98]It may be for the collection factor, just having it to have the whole tower power, but I'm not looking for one.
[253:09.54]It's not like, oh, I gotta go get one.
[253:15.60]Is that your P corner?
[253:16.80]It's a corner of, there's a closet right there.
[253:23.73]Yeah, he didn't say very much shit.
[253:25.02]You talk a lot of shit, except for the fact that I got my plus 10 intelligence rapier over there.
[253:32.07]That's a long rapier, too.
[253:38.85]It's unequipped.
[253:43.17]It's actually kind of true.
[253:45.09]That's actually kind of true.
[253:46.36]And it's funny that that's true.
[253:48.27]It is not equipped.
[253:50.48]That lava lamp is not going to get going in the time that we're going to do this.
[253:59.86]How often do you vacuum the stream room?
[254:02.39]Actually just did it.
[254:05.60]This is like maybe three or four days ago.
[254:07.85]So I do it frequently.
[254:12.57]Yeah, so this, I don't know which one is the right one.
[254:14.92]So this one is the SEGA CD one, and then the one behind it, yeah, 32X.
[254:20.53]That's rare Dude That's rare
[254:30.56]I think this game was $14, by the way.
[254:33.10]Not that rare.
[254:35.97]I had it, had it, had it.
[254:41.06]I've had it.
[254:59.68]I remember this game being very confusing.
[255:13.20]It's also super crusty if I remember too.
[255:18.25]Fahrenheit.
[255:25.59]This feels like a restaurant commercial.
[255:46.22]I don't know why this house is exploding.
[255:51.78]Alright.
[255:52.91]Please format the built-in memory.
[255:54.63]Bari, your SEGA CD is gonna burn alive!
[255:57.84]Hope you can do it in a hurry!
[256:00.79]That's scary.
[256:03.30]We're at 70 fucking Celsius.
[256:05.54]We're at 80 Celsius.
[256:06.29]We're at 90 Celsius.
[256:06.92]You've got to do it right now.
[256:17.34]Alright, I'm formatting it.

[259:24.76]Watch your time, guys.
[259:25.68]Those air tanks don't last forever.
[259:35.35]Why am I getting so close to this?
[259:41.47]Alright.

[259:43.52]Alright, where, where, where, where?

[260:18.21]I'm looking for somebody.
[260:19.13]Ooh, that's gas.

[260:24.03]We gotta shut this off.
[260:25.71]Alright, shut it up.
[260:29.91]The shut-off valve must be around us someplace.
[260:39.70]Chief, do you want me to go back inside?
[260:41.69]No, Hobbs.
[260:42.34]Stay here until they call you.
[260:48.05]It's really hard to see anything.

[261:04.88]Alright, through here.
[261:13.80]Get rid of that.
[261:16.62]Why would you pick that up?

[263:32.53]Please put V-Sync off.
[263:34.95]On.
[263:41.32]I don't think they even knew what that was 20 years ago.
[263:47.20]That didn't even exist.
[263:52.66]Alright, I'm ready.
[263:55.95]What about options?
[263:58.48]Level, easy.
[264:00.02]Indicators, on.

[264:08.88]30 years ago.
[264:10.73]Yeah.
[264:12.28]Okay.
[264:12.42]We know how this goes.
[264:15.73]So when I played this 10 years ago, I wonder how many things I said the same.
[264:22.15]Alright, let's go.
[264:24.14]Bring it in.
[264:35.00]I hear somebody.
[264:44.10]Why would that be on the TV?
[264:49.97]What, that's on the television?
[264:54.91]What are you watching?
[265:02.87]We...
[265:05.26]I'm so confused at what just happened.
[265:12.99]Alright, straight in.
[265:17.53]What do you mean, back to the academy?
[265:19.47]Your incompetence is going to get someone killed.
[265:21.78]It's a damn good thing Stinky was using his head.
[265:26.66]Did I walk out the front door?
[265:28.35]I didn't know that I left.
[265:35.55]I didn't know that I left the area.
[265:44.12]They're stinking!
[265:47.55]Alright, get in and...
[265:52.27]I'm going straight in.
[265:53.30]Straight front door.
[265:56.80]Straight again.
[266:03.73]Watch your time, guys.
[266:04.63]Those air tanks don't last forever.
[266:06.28]straight again after this.
[266:07.69]Yep, we saw this before.
[266:17.37]Alright, left.
[266:22.30]Through here.
[266:23.63]Okay.
[266:24.69]Turn the gas off.
[266:35.59]Okay, straight ahead.
[266:44.45]Alright, where do we turn the gas off in here?
[266:55.28]Okay, how?
[267:03.89]That's not where it was.
[267:14.59]This guy, I'm just walked around the same place.
[267:20.51]I'm looking for a shutoff valve.
[267:26.03]His character.
[267:28.49]Okay, that's not a problem.
[267:40.73]Look, I don't think anyone's in here.
[267:49.69]When I press up, it's going the way that I was currently moving, right?
[267:57.79]Oh my fucking god.
[268:01.71]Put the fucking gas can down.
[268:13.20]We walked in a circle, man.
[268:24.11]Look out!
[268:25.77]You've got to be more careful.
[268:32.72]OK, it's in this room.
[268:36.79]To the right.
[268:38.92]Right there.
[268:42.15]No, that's a door.
[268:44.02]No, we're gonna do the... We're gonna... We're gonna...
[268:59.40]Okay, that's not a problem.
[269:06.30]This guy's a fucking idiot.
[269:08.29]This guy's a fucking idiot.
[269:16.16]Hey, go get those tanks, stinky.
[269:18.61]Wait, we're going up, we're going up, we're going up, we're going up.
[269:28.42]Alright, we're up the stairs.
[269:30.22]I'm gonna say left.
[269:39.51]Uh, I guess I don't get a choice.
[269:44.95]Huh?
[269:48.44]Yes.
[269:49.24]Test.
[269:49.81]No.
[269:50.79]Yes.
[269:51.28]I don't know.
[269:51.64]What button is yes?
[269:54.03]I didn't say...
[270:01.23]I didn't know.
[270:06.69]I didn't know what button that was.
[270:13.13]That was like a scene from Poltergeist.
[270:20.65]Why did I get sucked away?
[270:22.54]What the fuck just happened?
[270:28.79]Yeah, that was a Looney Tune.
[270:30.40]That was like Bugs Bunny.
[270:34.02]Remember your drills.
[270:35.30]Alright, just go up the stairs and don't- don't listen to that guy!
[270:41.98]What's that guy's job here?
[270:43.35]That guy's like, hey, we should open this right now.
[270:45.89]In fact, you do it.
[270:53.46]Okay, here we go.
[270:54.18]Boom.
[270:54.74]Back where we were.
[270:56.99]Okay, it's right through the door.
[271:06.23]Okay that's not a problem.
[271:09.64]It's straight through the door.
[271:17.56]I can't fucking believe I exploded.
[271:30.82]Up the stairs and then test the door.
[271:35.40]Up the stairs.
[271:36.91]Go, up the stairs.
[271:38.09]No, we are not, you idiot!
[271:41.10]Are you even paying attention to the HUD?
[271:44.83]Alright, test the door before you go in it.
[271:56.22]That looks fucking insane.
[272:03.89]This is the only one that's shut.
[272:05.54]She's probably in here.
[272:06.48]Yeah, test.
[272:07.14]I'm getting ventilated.
[272:09.45]Test.
[272:10.59]Do you want to check for heat?
[272:12.56]What did you say?
[272:17.24]Okay, so don't go in!
[272:18.68]Why are you counting down so fast?
[272:28.36]What?
[272:40.75]Alright, bathroom.
[272:43.60]Grab that.
[272:44.12]It'll make the owners happy.
[272:47.33]A box of jewels?
[272:48.94]Why are we taking the jewels first?
[272:50.55]I think this is a not priority.
[272:56.34]Alright, straight ahead, I think.
[273:03.16]Alright, here we go.
[273:03.84]We're in a room.
[273:04.18]We're in a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom.
[273:05.50]Look around.
[273:05.89]Look around.
[273:06.21]Bedroom.
[273:12.39]There's access here for a ladder.
[273:14.31]Stinky, flight in.
[273:15.38]Stinky, fly in.
[273:17.52]I...
[273:18.23]I...
[273:18.33]I... What?
[273:25.65]No, no, no, back, back, back, back, go back, go back in there.
[273:33.15]Alright, stinky.
[273:35.62]Wait, this is a different room.
[273:42.33]Forget it.
[273:43.27]There's no way we can use this window.
[273:45.04]We gotta find another way out.
[273:47.97]Hobbs, get the paramedics over here.
[273:49.82]I don't like the way this is going.
[273:55.91]Guys, it's hard to determine what is left and what is right.
[274:04.78]I found somebody!
[274:08.23]Um...
[274:20.06]Don't go near there.
[274:21.51]Don't go near that.
[274:22.86]I'm trying to just go out the left door.
[274:27.52]Oh my god, you idiots.
[274:29.30]I don't know what left and right and straight even means in this game.
[274:33.70]It doesn't even tell.
[274:34.40]It's wrong.
[274:37.27]Why are you opening the same door again?
[274:55.33]Straight out straight, apparently.
[274:57.05]I'm confused too, dude.
[275:11.48]Out the left door!
[275:12.30]Out the door!
[275:12.66]Go go go go go go go!
[275:13.52]I got it, I got it, I got it!
[275:15.53]Stinky!
[275:17.72]Stinky, drop the ladder!
[275:25.99]Got it.
[275:28.91]Not the time to make a comment like that.
[275:34.73]Absolutely unprofessional comment.
[275:37.28]I'm gonna bring that up to the chief.
[275:38.98]Unprofessional comment.
[275:40.20]Are you alright?
[275:41.54]Oh, god, I'm so glad you're alive.
[275:44.13]Not bad, kid.
[275:45.62]That was a bit close for a job this size.
[275:54.29]That's the same thing they do when they tell you that Burger King uses fresh, flame-broiled ingredients.
[276:02.54]The same image.
[276:06.49]Dispatch, we're almost on the scene.
[276:08.49]What have you got for me?
[276:09.82]Over.
[276:10.66]There's a lot of safety violations on that place.
[276:13.21]There are standing work orders for the wiring and plumbing.
[276:16.59]There's another one for improper storage of flammable materials.
[276:20.24]Okay.
[276:22.35]You got it.
[276:25.57]We need two lines on the left.
[276:28.73]Officer who called this in.
[276:32.24]I did.
[276:33.27]Is this your hotel?
[276:34.52]No, I just manage it at night.
[276:36.05]Is everybody out?
[276:37.13]How should I know?
[276:38.46]What the hell is that supposed to mean?
[276:40.30]Take a look at this, mister.
[276:41.33]It ain't the Reds.
[276:42.81]Ah, the old joint was pretty quiet tonight.
[276:44.44]I guess I saw most of the old timers coming out.
[276:47.12]Help!
[276:49.30]I gotta get my babies!
[276:53.20]Don't stay right where you are.
[276:54.20]We'll get you down.
[276:57.29]I gotta find my babies!
[276:58.33]What did she say?
[277:03.64]I shouldn't be laughing.
[277:10.53]What was she saying?
[277:12.12]All I know is that when the old elevator shuts off, the alarm goes off.
[277:15.83]Rescue company, move out.
[277:16.76]We got someone in there.
[277:22.98]That lady needs to be helped immediately.
[277:28.15]Oh, get the lady!
[277:44.25]In my room.
[277:46.90]Bang.
[277:48.20]Bang.
[277:48.77]Shells.
[277:49.97]Bombs.
[277:51.12]Bullets.
[277:51.62]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[277:54.37]What?
[277:56.08]Alright, let's go.
[278:01.31]Straight ahead.
[278:05.53]Right.
[278:06.85]I...
[278:07.68]Right.
[278:14.01]Nobody in here.
[278:15.14]I think it's clear.
[278:19.09]This was clear.
[278:20.16]She's not here.
[278:22.20]Let's get busy.
[278:31.28]Left.
[278:32.80]I guess right.
[278:34.11]Are we going in?
[278:35.21]Test it first.
[278:38.15]It's cold.
[278:38.93]Break it.
[278:40.54]No, it said break.
[278:41.85]What?
[278:46.62]I wanted to break...
[278:54.83]The pixelization added an R into that text.
[279:04.99]Yes!
[279:14.39]Wait, what happened?
[279:18.50]Is that guy dead?
[279:23.17]I thought he said it was cold.
[279:34.30]Ma'am?
[279:44.89]Ma'am, are you in here?
[279:55.21]Alright, check this right door.
[280:01.79]Ma'am?
[280:04.61]Where is this lady?
[280:13.72]One on the right here.
[280:16.49]Test it.
[280:19.70]Go.
[280:26.67]Why are there gigantic tanks in here?
[280:34.90]Who is keeping gigantic nitrous oxide in the hotel room?
[280:47.07]I don't know.
[280:47.67]Where is she then?
[280:52.95]No wonder it's on fire.
[280:54.06]What the hell was that?
[281:02.53]What door did I miss?
[281:06.23]Okay, it's not this one.
[281:07.28]What door did I miss?
[281:10.85]There's a dentist.
[281:11.67]Someone's having a dentist appointment in their hotel room.
[281:15.22]This one's clear.
[281:16.56]She's not here.
[281:18.33]Let's get busy.
[281:19.57]It had to have been one of those first doors in the first corridor.
[281:33.54]No, no, no, we gotta keep, we gotta go all the way down.
[281:37.23]All the way down.
[281:42.81]don't know how many doors down we have to go but it's at least two or three
[282:00.22]Could I have gone down the other hallway?
[282:02.29]It's hard to tell.
[282:05.32]Stop checking the same rooms.
[282:06.50]Dude, the controls of this game are like somebody hits you in the head with a wrench and then it's like, try to find your way around a pixelated fucking room.
[282:20.79]Test it.
[282:24.20]Go.
[282:29.72]Where is this lady?
[282:32.43]I know you got a thing about animals, but we can't cart that thing around with us.
[282:35.28]We'll come back if we got time.
[282:37.29]Wait, wait a minute.
[282:37.77]What was it?
[282:38.15]Was it a bird?
[282:46.58]Not this one.
[282:54.98]There was a door on the right.
[282:58.86]When we turn around, it's the first door on the left.
[283:01.03]I don't know, man.
[283:02.23]It's so hard to navigate what you're doing.
[283:17.85]Where is this lady?
[283:32.06]Test it.
[283:35.11]Test it again.
[283:37.80]Don't do it.
[283:53.27]You're doing fine, but we're gonna be out of air in no time.
[283:55.83]Let's pick it up a bit.
[284:14.16]I think we're dead.
[284:16.37]That old lady is a pile of ash right now.
[284:18.72]Oh my God, stop.
[284:20.67]Let's get busy.
[284:24.20]I'm gonna find her.
[284:26.18]She's gonna be on the right-hand side.
[284:27.99]Right here.
[284:28.49]Ready?
[284:29.70]Let's go left, and then right.
[284:33.13]This is the one, for sure.
[284:34.57]Test it.
[284:38.42]Fuck, don't go on that one.
[284:43.30]Right side.
[284:44.24]Come on.
[284:44.46]It's got to be one of these.
[284:55.98]There are like two or three different corridors that are the same corridor.
[285:04.30]And it's hard to say where the fuck...
[285:09.53]Joby, you're out of there.
[285:12.78]I'm sending in a real professional.
[285:24.51]Dude, I don't fucking know.
[285:26.28]That was crazy.
[285:32.68]Should I speedrun it?
[285:36.51]I don't think there's any passwords either.
[285:48.14]save the birds alright this one's up the stairs and then see if I can remember this one
[286:00.19]I don't even know how I did this one, honestly.
[286:22.75]I gotta go up the stairs.
[286:24.64]Where even is the staircase, dude?
[286:26.47]I just don't even remember.
[286:28.11]It's been the same pixelated fire for 25 minutes.
[286:38.27]Okay, where is it?
[286:39.00]The staircase over here?
[286:39.70]Or is it straight ahead?
[286:42.26]I wish they didn't turn the camera.
[286:51.18]You got us running around in circles.
[286:54.93]Get your act together.
[286:57.32]Because when they turn the camera, it's like, is that left?
[287:00.40]No, I have to press left, but I'm facing straight.
[287:08.87]what is going on you're moving to the hallway on the watch your time guys those air tanks don't last forever
[287:16.27]Because the manual has a floor plan.
[287:27.97]McGuire, how's it going in there?
[287:30.17]Don't ask me.
[287:40.83]guys guys over there there's Sparks flying all over the neighbor's room yeah we got it there's so many rooms there are like 40 rooms
[287:55.69]Okay, that's not a problem.
[287:58.67]Can you please read the description of the third and final level of this game?
[288:04.40]Please go ahead.
[288:05.11]Go ahead and tell me what the third and final level of this game is.
[288:08.58]Read it, please.
[288:09.48]Read it out loud.
[288:15.07]look I don't think anyone's in here a mad scientist has taken over the university
[288:27.01]The science blocks of a university are under a state of siege, and a professor of physics has finally snapped.
[288:33.57]He started a chain reaction of booby traps in the basement and tunnels.
[288:37.00]What?
[288:49.95]It's almost like they were like, okay, we can do, we got this hotel, we got this residential.
[288:55.53]How many, how many places can you go to do this?
[289:01.88]Alright, let me see the floor plan.
[289:08.34]Alright, if I follow the floor plan,
[289:12.43]Metroid had less complex maps than this level 3 map.
[289:16.11]Oh my god.
[289:17.96]Fucking God.
[289:19.61]I want everybody that is calling me an idiot for in this game.
[289:24.17]to look at this floor plan.
[289:26.22]And you know how the game is played.
[289:27.40]You know how everything works, right?
[289:29.15]You tell me that I don't know where I'm going.
[289:33.00]Look at this.
[289:34.22]This looks like a fucking anthill.
[289:50.63]How are you ever supposed to look at this?
[289:53.21]This is a complicated map.
[289:59.05]Do you want to see the hotel one?
[290:00.17]The hotel one's not even better.
[290:01.88]Are you shitting me?
[290:07.84]The hotel one is way bigger.
[290:09.55]That's crazy.
[290:16.87]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[290:19.76]Is this on easy?
[290:21.55]This is the difficulties?
[290:27.13]That's quite a difference.
[290:31.37]Level three easy.
[290:32.72]No way.
[290:33.84]No way.
[290:34.97]Do you guys have an image of the of the hotel?
[290:39.26]It looks like bismuth crystals.
[290:40.71]Yeah, that's absolute horseshit.
[290:42.91]No one's going to get through that.
[290:54.23]This is the hotel.
[290:55.16]Yeah, look at this.
[290:55.80]This only has one difficulty.
[290:59.46]Look at this.
[291:01.40]Yeah, I, yeah, oh my god, I can't believe you don't know where you're going.
[291:04.09]It's like, dude, it's so easy.
[291:06.38]Look at this shit, it's fucking insane.
[291:07.99]Oh!
[291:12.56]I fucking hate Windows.
[291:34.63]There's two floors of the hotel.
[291:37.66]She's in one of these rooms.
[291:43.24]Yeah, good luck trying to navigate through this and opening all these.
[291:53.06]Easy is two floors, normal is three, hard is four floors.
[291:56.63]Yeah, I'm done.
[291:59.38]I'm done.
[292:07.15]I'm gonna spend forever looking for this lady.
[292:12.40]I love that.
[292:13.84]That level three is so funny.
[292:16.77]That's crazy.
[292:17.66]What a crazy game.
[292:22.07]You need to play the mad scientist one.
[292:23.50]Alright, here's what I'll do.
[292:24.46]Not today, because this is the end of the stream.
[292:29.58]The next time we do SEGA CD, I'm going to... Hopefully it's not random.
[292:35.58]I'm going to play it.
[292:36.18]I'm going to get to the third level.
[292:38.41]Or...
[292:39.99]We'll see the third level.
[292:41.46]We will see the third level.
[292:42.67]Don't you worry.
[292:43.88]I will make sure of it.
[292:48.76]This does make me wonder if you weren't going in circles for the hotel.
[292:51.25]I don't know if I was because when you got the three choices,
[292:56.63]When you got to the section, see in the top left, like west, north, west.
[293:01.79]You can choose to go left and right.
[293:03.37]I think I may have done a circle around the middle.
[293:05.96]I don't know.
[293:08.46]It's so hard to tell.
[293:13.79]You can't Dave state it if you're not emulating it.
[293:18.38]Well, well, I mean, talking about the SEGA CD Enhanced Edition.
[293:29.09]We'll see.
[293:29.98]We'll see how I get to the third level.
[293:36.84]Senator Dave State.
[293:40.75]Alright, that's it though.
[293:41.80]There was some good ones in this one.
[293:43.52]I had a lot of fun.
[293:53.46]I do like playing it on original hardware though.
[293:55.59]I think it's like something, something is more tactile and tangible to me.
[294:01.43]But I own almost the whole collection.
[294:04.12]So we'll see.
[294:09.40]And that's it.
[294:09.80]I know you're hearing a buzzing sound probably.
[294:15.06]Thanks for hanging out, though.
[294:16.95]See you guys later.
[294:18.86]I plan on doing a stream on Christmas Eve.
[294:21.73]I'll be live not for very long maybe just like two or three hours just to hang out uh I'm probably gonna show auto you'll be able to see auto
[294:32.53]We'll do a little, uh, auto hangout stream.
[294:36.38]And...
[294:37.37]I'll probably play something.
[294:38.71]I'll probably end with auto.
[294:41.69]It's been a while since everybody has seen Otto.
[294:45.01]And I know I talked about him a week or two ago.
[294:49.01]But he's doing okay.
[294:51.06]He's doing fine.
[294:53.51]But I do want to put him on stream.
[294:55.86]I know that... Not like I'll put him on stream, but...
[294:57.91]I know that a lot of people in this channel that have been here for a long time
[295:04.89]There are a lot of people that were here when I made the video with Otto for the first time.
[295:09.08]That's, you know, 2012.
[295:11.05]Some of you guys have been around since that video.
[295:13.77]So over the years, he's kind of just been here the whole time I've been doing this.
[295:18.98]And you see him every so often, he pops in every now and then.
[295:21.05]So I kind of do want to show him again.
[295:26.34]And again, I don't know what the timetable for him is, but
[295:30.93]He's just still around.
[295:31.96]He's still hanging out.
[295:33.24]He's still happy.
[295:33.95]He's still comfortable.
[295:36.30]So, until that stops happening, right?
[295:41.93]But I'll see you on Christmas Eve.
[295:43.97]Take care of yourselves.
[295:44.58]Thanks for watching.
[295:48.18]Have a great rest of your evening, or whatever time it currently is for you.
[295:54.22]See you soon.
[295:56.63]See you later.
[296:00.46]That's all there is to it.
[296:08.56]Take care.
[296:09.53]Bye-bye.
[296:10.72]Call your mother.
[296:12.87]Call your mother.
[296:16.75]You get me?
[296:18.82]See you later.
[296:46.65]Big Jay signing off.
[296:50.54]I didn't say that.
[296:55.63]But yeah, bye.
