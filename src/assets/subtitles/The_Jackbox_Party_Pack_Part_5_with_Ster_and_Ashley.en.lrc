[00:01.51]Okay.
[00:02.33]Hello.
[00:03.37]I had to take care of Otto.
[00:13.96]Kill him?
[00:15.12]Take care of Otto.
[00:15.72]This game's kind of loud.
[00:19.50]There we go.
[00:23.59]Alright, so.
[00:26.49]What do you guys want to do?
[00:30.19]There we go.
[00:31.18]I don't know.
[00:32.52]Do you want to do?
[00:33.46]We'll go open.
[00:34.54]Open up my stream.
[00:36.38]I'm opening it.
[00:36.96]Okay.
[00:37.16]Looks like you're getting tea.
[00:44.79]Not for long.
[00:47.03]Mine won't start for some reason.
[00:52.19]Now I do.
[00:54.03]Why do I have a black screen?
[00:56.53]Cat.
[00:56.71]Why can't I knock that one?
[00:59.51]What the fuck?
[01:02.65]Well, we have to do window capture, or fuck it, we'll just do this.
[01:05.99]It's already here.
[01:13.57]Alright.
[01:15.74]So we have Trivia Murder Party.
[01:19.16]A serial killer is running an absurd trivia game out of the family-run murder hotel he grew up in.
[01:23.34]Can you survive?
[01:26.38]Role models... Excuse me, did you say family-run murder hotel?
[01:29.77]Uh, yes.
[01:30.39]That is correct.
[01:33.53]Then there's role models.
[01:34.53]Everybody's somebody, so who are you?
[01:36.07]The planner?
[01:36.75]The flake?
[01:37.33]The sassy one?
[01:38.79]Step into the lab and find out.
[01:40.05]We can just do them all.
[01:43.69]We'll just start a Trivia Murder Party 2.
[01:44.97]Alright.
[01:48.56]Trivia Murder Party 2 is what we're starting with.
[01:51.84]And I'm gonna give you guys- I'm gonna tell you guys the secret code.
[01:57.02]Aww.
[02:06.18]If it'll load.
[02:11.17]Is it gonna load?
[02:13.75]There we go.
[02:14.81]Alright.
[02:16.63]I need to set up some stuff.
[02:19.79]Audience, full screen.
[02:21.31]Eh, turn it down a little.
[02:24.59]It could be a little loud.
[02:25.69]Alright, now I have to do this.
[02:27.02]Do I do the hide?
[02:28.02]Subtitles, max player is 8.
[02:32.80]Room code hiding.
[02:35.14]I got it, don't worry.
[02:37.76]Okay.
[02:38.88]Filter US-centric questions.
[02:41.36]Reduce the number of US questions?
[02:43.18]What?
[02:43.50]Why?
[02:44.94]Require Twitch.
[02:47.08]Require players to be logged into Twitch.
[02:51.73]I kind of need the tutorials.
[02:59.29]I don't need extended timers.
[03:00.35]Okay.
[03:01.31]So now... Hold on.
[03:04.49]This thing is... Let me just do this for a second.
[03:08.30]Hold on.
[03:08.90]Hold on.
[03:09.38]Everybody relax.
[03:11.18]Okay, I'm going to run to the bathroom.
[03:12.68]Go to the bathroom.
[03:13.24]I'm going to get tea.
[03:14.17]Go to the bathroom.
[03:14.75]Go get tea because something's messed up over here.
[03:16.85]Look at this.
[03:23.17]Why is he doing this?
[03:27.43]This shouldn't be doing this.
[03:36.08]What's going on?
[03:41.71]No, turn that off.
[03:44.33]Turn that off.
[03:47.95]Window cap.
[03:48.51]Why is it doing this?
[03:50.97]So is this trivia about murderers, or are they going to murder us if we get them wrong?
[03:55.66]This trivia is about surviving.
[03:58.24]I don't know.
[04:01.06]So what the fuck is this?
[04:01.88]Well, I'm bringing up Murderpedia, just in case.
[04:07.06]Is that being captured?
[04:09.73]It's glitching out over here.
[04:10.55]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[04:11.65]Alright, that should be fine.
[04:14.25]Alright.
[04:18.02]Let me, uh, make sure this is gonna work.
[04:19.44]Alright, I have a room code here for you guys in a second.
[04:25.40]In just a moment.
[04:27.48]When he's ready.
[04:28.80]I gotta write this down.
[04:32.83]So then I can put it in the Discord.
[04:37.84]This code is gonna be in the sub Discord, those of you subs.
[04:43.99]It's gonna be there in just a second.
[04:47.83]After they get it.
[04:48.41]I'm ready, but he's not.
[04:54.07]I will just tell you what it is.
[04:55.60]Wait, is he streaming still?
[04:58.15]Uh, no.
[04:58.75]Uh, no.
[04:59.09]Okay.
[04:59.25]No.
[04:59.39]Alright, I'm gonna mute, and I'm gonna tell you what it is.
[05:02.11]Are you ready?
[05:03.83]Uh, where do we type it in?
[05:04.95]I was in the back.
[05:05.59]You go to jackbox.TV, and you are going to write in the room code.
[05:14.32]Okay.
[05:16.68]Ready?
[05:17.86]Yes.
[05:19.52]Okay.
[05:20.36]I'm about to mute.
[05:21.52]Wait, I have to get in first.
[05:22.44]Just... Here.
[05:24.48]Uh, the code is...
[05:27.58]I remember this.
[05:28.06]I have to get in first.
[05:31.06]Like, on my phone, I have to get in.
[05:33.50]I remember this shit.
[05:35.80]Oh, like another browser, right?
[05:36.95]Yeah.
[05:38.31]I fucked this up last time we did this.
[05:41.79]Nobody said anything.
[05:42.85]Trying to get me to fuck this up.
[05:43.91]Alright.
[05:48.49]The code is...
[06:00.48]Okay.
[06:01.00]Room requires Twitch login.
[06:02.46]Yeah, you have to be connected to Twitch.
[06:05.06]How do I do that?
[06:08.54]There's a little drop down that says Twitch.
[06:11.13]You click the little top left drop down and click on the Twitch button.
[06:15.53]And you should be able to log in.
[06:17.75]Okay, now what was the room password?
[06:19.39]The room password is...
[06:30.40]It'll work.
[06:32.16]It'll work.
[06:32.56]I'm in.
[06:33.88]So now, hey, Discord.
[06:37.99]Hey, Discord, you're going to want to type in... Here we go.
[06:42.55]Same joke again.
[06:43.23]Yeah, you're doing the same thing again, aren't you?
[06:45.86]Just the same joke again.
[06:47.30]Go for it.
[06:48.60]That's all I have.
[06:54.40]Some people have gotten in.
[06:58.05]There's still some slots.
[06:58.93]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[07:00.43]No, there's not.
[07:01.25]Join it!
[07:09.90]There was like a little bookshelf thing.
[07:14.90]MCFN on Jackbox.TV.
[07:16.92]You can participate in the game.
[07:20.60]Aw, your little dude looks like Easter.
[07:24.08]Like a total nerd.
[07:25.37]Ready?
[07:26.98]Everybody's in.
[07:31.46]Okay, sit back and relax.
[07:32.62]Where's the everybody's in button?
[07:40.05]Alright, we're good.
[07:44.35]MCFN, join it.
[07:45.45]What about me?
[07:55.80]Yeah, I feel like my browser is in control of this because I'm the one that enabled it to start and I have a skip button for this.
[08:05.76]Yeah, you are.
[08:07.06]I don't know how I got VIP.
[08:08.64]You got VIP because you got in first and I didn't.
[08:13.62]As long as one of us is out, it doesn't matter.
[08:16.14]Okay.
[08:16.42]Oh, yeah.
[08:17.04]I'm in control.
[08:21.32]Hello?
[08:21.60]There's the VIP.
[08:26.68]Welcome to Trivia Murder Party!
[08:29.89]Those free vacation coupons you received in the mail were a trick, luring you into a game with deadly consequences.
[08:38.89]Only one of you will survive.
[08:40.65]Anyway, we know you have many choices for your murder hotel needs, and we're grateful you chose us.
[08:47.89]Okay, first question.
[08:50.27]Whose memoir is titled, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?
[08:57.54]Use your device to answer the question.
[08:59.48]Whose memoir is titled, Is Everyone Hanging Out With Me?
[09:02.98]Who are these people?
[09:06.25]I know two of these people.
[09:08.45]I know one.
[09:14.65]And we die if we don't answer this one.
[09:17.21]In the correct answer.
[09:18.17]I got that wrong.
[09:18.67]Aww.
[09:25.97]The rest of you, come with me.
[09:28.09]Yeah, I'm gonna have a kid!
[09:29.80]I can't believe there's 7,000 people in the audience.
[09:32.76]Time to get out the dice.
[09:33.68]Don't worry, this one's real straightforward.
[09:35.48]The player who rolls the highest will die.
[09:37.12]But we've got some help to make this more interesting.
[09:52.97]You have an extra die that you can give to whoever you want to make their odds worse.
[09:57.25]Because I didn't know who wrote that memoir?
[09:59.05]Oh, shit.
[10:02.84]I need to read more books.
[10:05.88]Well, good luck, Star.
[10:07.64]More celebrity memoirs.
[10:09.02]The player with the highest total dies.
[10:12.10]Oh, no.
[10:15.10]Awesome Sauce is dead.
[10:22.22]That's the worst way to die.
[10:27.38]Kill bonus.
[10:29.72]Holy shit, wow.
[10:30.70]We've got 15,000 people in the audience today.
[10:33.96]Don't freak out.
[10:35.74]But you're a ghost now.
[10:37.09]Keep playing and you just might steal someone else's life force and win the game.
[10:42.27]Oh, by the way, the audience is a player now and can win the whole fucking game.
[10:46.51]If you're not aware, you can join the audience, whatever.
[10:49.43]It's like super low pressure.
[10:51.71]It's just fucking up everything.
[10:56.85]Oh, I know this one.
[10:58.89]I know this one.
[10:59.68]I heard that shit.
[11:00.74]I know the song.
[11:01.80]Do I get points for answering it instantly?
[11:23.97]time's running out I don't even know who made this song or what the song is it's like a song for girl scout camp it's like a little kid song oh I got it wrong oh my god why do I know this on my way because they're because I have a shitload of bases and nephews
[11:48.47]I hope you're good with instructions.
[11:50.43]Follow as many rules as you can before time runs out.
[11:53.74]The player who follows the fewest rules correctly dies.
[11:59.60]The rules are already on your device.
[12:01.54]Go, go!
[12:02.70]The most disobedient player dies.
[12:06.95]Star, what's going on, Star?
[12:10.03]Star, what are you doing?
[12:11.85]I'm so confused.
[12:12.45]There's not a lot for me to do during this game.
[12:14.85]Hmm.
[12:16.53]I guess I'll update my LinkedIn account.
[12:22.59]Almost out of rules time.
[12:29.73]Star dead.
[12:31.09]I didn't realize it was starting and it was timed.
[12:33.88]I didn't realize.
[12:45.24]I would have voted for Star.
[12:46.84]I voted for Star.
[12:50.76]I wrote this next question just for you.
[12:54.17]If you get it right, I will punish everyone else.
[12:57.51]Wait, what?
[12:58.57]Who do I keep more than half my bones?
[13:01.43]How come this person gets to punish everybody?
[13:03.63]And I guess the audience can answer too.
[13:05.97]Me old bones?
[13:08.43]What are these questions?
[13:10.36]I think you have to pay attention.
[13:11.56]I think he said like a line.
[13:12.74]Well, I have to stream mute it because then I'll hear myself.
[13:15.82]This isn't fair.
[13:16.78]Alright, I can't do like a delay.
[13:26.11]Did you get the question right?
[13:29.23]You succeeded.
[13:29.97]There's subtitles I can't read.
[13:31.75]The rust will suffer.
[13:32.75]Yeah, I got subtitles on.
[13:36.25]Oh no, got it right.
[13:37.37]It's the classic game, Chalices.
[13:40.23]I've given each safe player a poison pellet.
[13:44.28]Pick a chalice to drop your poison in.
[13:47.78]What do you mean put... This is freaking me out.
[13:55.35]Now it's your turn to play.
[13:58.59]Pick a chalice to drink from.
[14:00.19]Oh no.
[14:01.38]Drinking from a cup with a poison pellet will kill you.
[14:04.85]If you trust doctors.
[14:06.13]Drink, drink, drink.
[14:08.29]Yeah, I mean, you have to go with the obvious shot.
[14:09.75]Refresh aim.
[14:10.57]Now let's see what everyone drank.
[14:12.49]The big skull?
[14:13.71]Yeah.
[14:16.33]No, I'm not going to put the poison in the skull.
[14:18.41]That's too obvious.
[14:19.07]That's why I clicked it.
[14:20.75]I'm safe.
[14:22.99]Come here, I'm a clever.
[14:29.38]It was too obvious.
[14:30.54]That's why I didn't poison it.
[14:31.56]Why are there 17,000 people in the audience game part?
[14:34.12]Because somebody has like four computers turned down.
[14:36.66]They're going to burn down their house.
[14:41.20]Bot farming there somewhere.
[14:44.17]I don't know.
[14:56.43]That's a pretty easy question.
[14:58.49]Cigarette butts.
[14:59.67]It's not allowed.
[15:00.27]I'm running out.
[15:06.47]Who picked... this?
[15:09.53]Everybody.
[15:13.37]One of you is still alive.
[15:15.27]Follow me.
[15:15.61]Packing peanuts.
[15:18.81]What's the significance in me being dead?
[15:21.49]Um, I think you can... You can't play anymore.
[15:22.82]You can influence the game.
[15:24.08]Ah, the lost art of letter writing.
[15:25.40]I have to play that one.
[15:28.07]I'm going to dictate a message to you.
[15:30.23]Write down as much of what I say as you can.
[15:32.38]Everyone else will be typing too.
[15:34.94]And if anyone does a better job than you, you die.
[15:38.16]Get ready.
[15:41.16]What are we doing?
[15:42.51]Starting letter now.
[15:44.25]Dear local action news team, do you take requests?
[15:48.79]I would like to see more of your stories that share positive images and less segments about the crimes that I have committed.
[15:59.59]Viewers are tired of all the sad stories I am directly responsible for.
[16:06.85]Time's up.
[16:09.32]Now let me just see what we have here with the, um, bricks.
[16:12.54]And what's the result?
[16:13.30]No, you tricked me!
[16:13.92]We're supposed to type out what that did!
[16:15.24]What did anyone do better than you?
[16:16.58]We're supposed to type that whole thing out?
[16:19.86]You got outperformed.
[16:22.03]That's not even close to what I said.
[16:23.53]Again, I can't hear anything that's being said on the stream.
[16:26.79]I don't hear this guy talking.
[16:30.91]Oh god.
[16:38.67]It's alright.
[16:39.09]I'm still doing alright.
[16:44.70]Dead last.
[16:45.40]We're good.
[16:45.88]Let's try another one.
[16:48.66]What has three hearts?
[16:49.60]You could have been good on that one.
[16:52.70]You guys confused me, so I stopped.
[16:54.85]This is a trick question, I think, is it?
[17:06.17]Almost out of time.
[17:07.35]A lobster doesn't... A lobster?
[17:08.41]Who picked... this?
[17:09.07]I want to show you something.
[17:22.40]Uh-oh.
[17:24.96]This is the one with the big creepy mirror.
[17:28.68]The ghost of my Aunt Mildred loves to write words on mirrors.
[17:31.79]Yeah?
[17:32.21]She has her own consistent handwriting.
[17:35.23]Now, Aunt Mildred is going to write a different word.
[17:37.87]What?
[17:38.27]But so will everyone else.
[17:40.31]Draw a word on the mirror, and maybe you'll trick someone into thinking it's Aunt Mildred's.
[17:45.90]I... Let the drawing begin.
[17:48.14]What the fuck?
[17:49.08]Draw a word?
[17:49.44]Pay attention to the words as they appear, and try to spot my auntie.
[17:57.33]Oh, I got it already.
[18:00.23]I got it.
[18:01.75]Everyone's gonna write some stupid nonsense.
[18:06.45]So many convincing words to choose from.
[18:08.93]Now, type the word that Aunt Mildred wrote or you die.
[18:19.61]You can tell because Aunt Mildred did not write sucks.
[18:22.87]Yeah, we're good.
[18:23.43]We're safe.
[18:23.93]I wonder if this is more or less ghosts than you'd find in most elevators.
[18:28.94]Makes you think.
[18:48.04]Let's keep moving.
[18:49.00]I want a Jerma to die.
[18:50.32]According to his website, what does my boy Bob Vila recommend I use to get the blood out of the lobby carpet?
[18:57.89]This is this old house with Bob Vila.
[19:00.74]My father used to watch this show every fucking day.
[19:12.32]times it'll stop I don't think I got this right though this sounds like boomer questions it is who picked that was what I was gonna pick that too everyone is wrong time for consequences I'll remember that though yeah good advice
[19:36.42]I'm giving you all scratch tickets.
[19:38.68]What a quirky last minute gift.
[19:40.76]Scratch and find three dollar signs to live.
[19:44.39]If you cheat scratching, I'll give you cash for every dollar sign you find.
[19:49.51]But if you scratch off even one skull, you die.
[19:54.55]I'm reading the subtitles and everything now like a good boy.
[19:59.14]Come on.
[20:04.86]You could scratch more.
[20:06.52]Oh, I think I'm dead.
[20:08.16]I-I-I already scratched.
[20:14.20]What?
[20:19.01]The contest is almost over.
[20:22.73]He got greedy.
[20:25.61]How the fuck did you do that?
[20:27.09]That's bullshit!
[20:28.49]Oh, the rights!
[20:29.73]No way!
[20:30.69]No way, you've got- What?
[20:32.73]That's wall hacks.
[20:38.65]You're all good.
[20:39.73]Only one of you is still alive.
[20:41.51]Them dying too makes it better.
[20:43.41]What the hell is this?
[20:47.72]Let me see if I can do this.
[20:50.92]Congrats on making it here alive.
[20:53.06]But can you escape?
[20:56.14]I'm going to give you a category.
[21:00.16]Books written in the first person.
[21:02.44]Tap each answer that fits the category and then press submit.
[21:05.56]Does that work?
[21:08.12]Can you just mute it?
[21:11.48]Time is almost up.
[21:13.30]It's really laggy.
[21:14.16]Let's see the right answers.
[21:15.32]Yeah, too laggy.
[21:17.76]you move forward one space for each correct answer.
[21:23.73]You're on your way to escaping.
[21:26.17]Oh wait, did you think it was going to be just you?
[21:30.63]That's cute.
[21:32.01]If a ghost catches you, then they can try to escape and win the game.
[21:36.44]Here's everyone's next question.
[21:40.32]And they get a third chance to help them catch up to you.
[21:47.40]Time is almost up.
[21:49.08]I think that's right.
[21:57.56]Here comes the next question.
[22:00.79]Plagues of Egypt in the Book of Exodus.
[22:09.93]Lightning!
[22:20.28]Zap!
[22:20.68]Yikes!
[22:21.16]There's a g-g-g-ghost right behind you!
[22:25.85]Words that are not bare!
[22:28.87]What the fuck are you talking about?
[22:32.93]Wait, I don't- What?
[22:33.99]This is just like a Jokey?
[22:36.97]This is- That's all of them.
[22:41.32]Hmm.
[22:42.22]You're better than I thought.
[22:46.74]Closing in.
[22:47.48]Uh-oh!
[22:48.34]Here comes trouble!
[22:52.48]It's only darkness.
[23:01.24]Candyland locations.
[23:04.68]Everybody knows there is no such thing as Peanut Acres.
[23:08.87]Of course Peanut Acres is real.
[23:10.55]Peanut Acres is the only one I didn't pick.
[23:12.21]How do you know?
[23:14.23]You stole some yummy life force.
[23:19.61]The darkness approaches.
[23:23.33]Beyoncé albums.
[23:24.91]Beyoncé albums?
[23:25.79]Uh-oh.
[23:28.77]Um... I don't know.
[23:30.87]Dude, like... I don't know.
[23:33.27]Why would... Only boomers would know any of this shit.
[23:36.21]I got them both fucking wrong.
[23:37.55]No, I didn't.
[23:42.24]Another life force swap.
[23:45.84]Don't let the darkness hit you on the way out.
[23:48.04]Come on, Star.
[23:53.55]Bingo.
[24:03.10]What?
[24:04.60]Val Kilmer is not Val Kilmer.
[24:06.36]Oh no, Americans.
[24:14.04]We're Americans.
[24:20.14]uh am I muted I shouldn't be muted am I muted no I've been hearing you don't listen to her okay now you're muted what the is a sausage phone a saucy phone
[24:47.67]Sousaphone.

[24:50.55]Fuck, I'm gonna lose.
[24:51.49]Sausage?
[24:51.83]You said sausage.
[24:55.68]Sausaphone?
[24:56.54]I thought it was an A. Oh, that's why I can't hear him.
[25:00.06]Uh oh.
[25:01.00]No, that wasn't Melissa McCarthy.
[25:18.21]Yeah.
[25:22.49]Somebody made it already!

[25:45.13]Alright.
[25:46.33]That's it for that one.
[25:48.38]That was alright.
[25:49.06]A little too draggy for me, in my opinion.
[25:51.16]I don't know about you guys.
[25:52.02]I think I felt the same way about the last one, too.
[25:55.74]I don't understand a single thing.
[25:58.39]I think they should only be video game questions to cater to us, you know?
[26:02.69]Yeah.
[26:03.57]Where's the questions like, you know, what character from The Legend of Zelda has the biggest heart instead of which sea creature has three, you know?
[26:13.41]We don't know that.
[26:15.24]That's the question I liked, actually, because I got that one right.
[26:19.03]Yeah, where's the video games only?
[26:20.45]Alright, we're gonna do, uh, what's the one below it?
[26:22.79]At least, like, big fucking nerd questions.
[26:26.49]We need a new code just to be clear that you'd be showing on screen.
[26:30.16]Yep.
[26:32.18]Okay, and you should join before me so that I am not the master.
[26:34.90]That's what I'm gonna do.

[29:12.82]Here it comes.
[29:20.68]Fuck, I forget it.
[29:21.38]Hold on.
[29:22.64]It was literally four characters.
[29:27.35]Okay.
[29:27.91]Yeah, our character portraits are mixed up.
[29:33.11]What are you talking about?
[29:34.43]I look like you.
[29:35.24]You look like... I don't know.
[29:37.96]Ashley has pigtails for sure.
[29:40.70]Stay quiet.
[29:41.34]One more person.
[29:42.04]Come on.
[29:43.30]And then I look like Ashley Lang.
[29:47.04]Alright.
[29:48.74]Oh, please.
[29:49.66]Whenever you're ready.
[29:52.56]Everybody's in.
[29:53.32]Everybody is in.
[29:54.22]There's the code on the screen.
[29:55.18]Join the audience.
[29:55.80]This is the Joke Factory.
[29:56.92]I don't even know what it's called.
[29:58.68]Joke Boat.
[30:02.69]I get it.
[30:03.09]C minus.
[30:06.15]Get it.
[30:06.37]It's in the lower right.
[30:08.97]Brainstorming, joke writing.
[30:19.70]It's brainstorming time.
[30:21.43]Before we jump into the jokes, let's do a little writing exercise to get inspired.
[30:26.47]On your device, you'll be prompted to write various topics like animals, people, or objects.
[30:31.49]Fill in whatever you think has a lot of comedic potential.
[30:34.52]If another player uses one of your topics in a winning joke, you'll get some bonus coins.
[30:39.86]Generate as many as you can.
[30:41.50]You have 45 seconds.
[30:43.00]Starting now.
[30:45.29]Great joke topic.
[30:46.53]Topics...
[31:21.01]Hmm.
[31:22.67]This writing exercise is ending soon.
[31:25.41]Uh, hold on.
[31:32.09]Follow the steps on your device to write two jokes.
[31:34.51]I did so bad.
[31:35.07]Trust your instincts, unless they're bad.
[31:36.57]None of mine were funny.
[31:37.77]No.
[31:38.23]Okay, hold on.
[31:40.36]Complete the jokes on your device.
[31:41.58]Okay.
[31:49.70]Um...
[31:53.56]This is... How can I make a punchline from this?
[31:59.53]I can't think with you talking.
[32:02.73]If I'm ever going to be a comedy writer, I have to fucking nail this.
[32:13.79]How the fuck... There's a joke for me button.
[32:16.13]Please make it funny for me.
[32:27.68]I, but this is the, this is, ugh.
[32:31.46]God damn it.
[32:33.54]I have to do this.
[32:34.90]I have to do this.
[32:35.78]We're going to find out if you're a real comedian or not right now.
[32:39.38]You'll find out.
[32:42.27]This is your legacy.
[32:43.67]No, no, fuck, I shouldn't have done that.
[32:47.15]I want redos on mine.
[32:48.59]I didn't realize I had another minute.
[32:50.53]Now we're talking comedy.
[32:53.85]Oh my god.
[32:54.75]God damn it.
[32:57.98]I want to redo.
[32:59.62]I'm done with my jokes.
[33:00.38]Are you guys done?
[33:01.86]Yeah, that's why, like, I don't have the timer in my window, but if I realized there was, like, 50 more seconds, I would have thought.
[33:06.49]You've got plenty of time.
[33:07.67]I would have thought.
[33:08.81]Oh.
[33:09.43]We have 50 more seconds?
[33:10.55]Shit.
[33:10.83]Yeah.
[33:11.17]I thought it was a race.
[33:13.45]I want to, can I go back?
[33:15.67]Joke boat.
[33:19.26]Captain, let me in.
[33:20.18]Ugh.
[33:26.94]The time pressure with, like, happy music in the chat, like, scrolling so fast.
[33:30.50]Dude, yeah, and Jerma talking about his, like, his life story.
[33:33.56]Mute me, mute me, mute me!
[33:35.17]I thought I had, like, ten seconds.
[33:36.55]I did not write poop for the record.
[33:39.63]Here we go.
[33:39.99]Not even once.
[33:41.35]You ever notice how cruise line captains drive like this, but barge captains drive like this?
[33:47.95]No?
[33:49.29]Okay, here's our first comment.
[33:50.49]I apologize for my joke already, even though it's exactly... Here we go.
[33:56.31]Oh, 42.
[33:58.59]Remember to say your catchphrase.
[34:05.59]Group of spoons walk into a bar and pee-pee poo-poo.
[34:09.09]That's fucking bad.
[34:13.16]No way, no bubble wrap.
[34:16.32]You gotta read it.
[34:21.12]What does perform the joke mean?
[34:23.10]I guess you just, I don't know, just do it.
[34:27.15]The buttons went away.
[34:28.03]I'm so dumb.
[34:30.18]I thought rap songs were good.
[34:31.68]Okay.
[34:35.56]They call me DNA.
[34:37.40]What the fuck does that mean?
[34:38.83]I really don't want to...
[34:52.31]How do I compete with Pee Pee Poo Poo?
[34:53.89]It's impossible.
[34:54.99]You can't compete with Pee Pee Poo Poo.
[34:57.79]You know, you're talking about Twitch chat.
[35:00.63]Oh, you lost.
[35:03.87]It like, wrapped.
[35:04.71]That's what it is.
[35:05.89]You hit them right in their field and they're like, no.
[35:08.93]Wait, you got a bonus?
[35:10.27]Get that light smattering of applause going.
[35:18.36]I call my bedroom the hell.
[35:21.02]Because I'm Satan.
[35:24.71]Ooh.
[35:26.97]This is just logical.
[35:34.71]My love life is like... What?
[35:38.61]My love life is like Napoleon.
[35:39.92]They always run away.
[35:42.50]Not your dad's compact car.
[35:44.08]What?
[35:45.62]This is catchphrase.
[35:46.52]Vote for your favorite joke now.
[35:49.18]I wish this was like the horror mansion.
[35:50.74]We get to vote which person dies.
[35:54.58]No, we're being thrown overboard in the end, I'm sure.
[35:59.80]Hey.
[36:11.33]Did I get a tie?
[36:14.05]770.
[36:15.11]Our next comic needs an introduction.
[36:17.47]Oh, it's me versus you.
[36:18.95]My jokes aren't jokes.
[36:23.43]I'm a nasty little dry erase board.
[36:26.69]Because I'm soaking wet.
[36:30.91]Who ordered the flight attendant?
[36:33.96]How desperate were you guys?
[36:35.26]I thought it was going to be me.
[36:46.66]Don't worry, they're all going to vote for you anyway, no matter what you say.
[36:48.42]I'm going to open up a store that only sells walruses and call it Walrus Mart.
[37:01.22]I don't get yours, Dharma.
[37:02.34]Can you explain the joke?
[37:03.22]How do you not get mine?
[37:04.35]It's the perfect setup.
[37:06.03]It's like a perfect setup.
[37:10.89]But you're a dry erase board.
[37:12.75]Don't you get it?
[37:13.37]No.
[37:14.81]Do I have to spell it out for you?
[37:16.95]Yeah.
[37:21.90]The one on the right just added march to the word walrus.
[37:27.06]Yeah, but at least this made sense.
[37:28.50]What the fuck?
[37:29.00]I like my friends like I like my cars.
[37:30.54]This whole bit is compact cars.
[37:56.85]every joke the punchline is compact cars why are they called flat earthers and not should be called flat skurfers is that your seat no I I haven't like bro bro brotoboro has gone twice I haven't gotten up on the stage once I'm scared I'm gonna vote for the compact car comic

[38:52.94]They're not... They just keep calling people up.
[38:55.80]I thought you were doing it for bad.
[38:58.68]When I was a kid, we didn't have hashtags.
[39:00.86]We had tic-tac-toe.
[39:06.18]Where's the succulent?
[39:08.07]That is very Boomer Joe.

[39:17.05]After all that.
[39:20.00]I'm voting for you, baby.
[39:21.00]You ever notice how Mr. Peanut looks?
[39:21.86]You ever notice how Mr. Peanut looks like a peanut in a suit?
[39:28.33]If you win and I, if I lose.
[39:30.53]A peanut in a suit?
[39:32.05]If I lose.
[39:32.63]He smelled it wrong.
[39:38.13]It's a comedy error.
[39:39.55]People think that's funny.
[39:41.11]People are saying that that was a funny joke.
[39:47.06]but my joke that had like setup and and and new ones I'm just also he's not in a suit that's right he only has a bow tie on I'm so brilliant compared to Jerma thank you thank you my adoring crowd folks put your hand and hook together for our next comedian oh they want me back encore they say encore give me a break
[40:13.68]Have you heard about the Big Bad Wolf Challenge?
[40:15.52]It's where you exercise until you huff and puff.
[40:20.28]That's as bad as mine was.
[40:22.30]That's actually the auto-generate joke.
[40:26.18]You, what?
[40:26.92]You hit the auto-generate button?
[40:28.59]I thought I had ten seconds!
[40:30.57]Oh my god.
[40:31.51]I honestly thought if I didn't type it in the next three seconds, it was going to do nothing.
[40:35.99]They turned on you.
[40:37.29]They turned on you real quick.
[40:40.21]Okay.
[40:41.13]Okay.
[40:45.84]I like when sex looks like a burger, extra cheesy and full of calories.
[40:52.18]Alright, yours was auto-generated, so I have to pick the other one.
[40:56.14]I still pick the AI over a joke that bad.
[40:58.62]That's like when, like, robots are gonna take over the world.
[41:04.77]And you're letting them.
[41:06.11]Wait, no, you, wait, yes.
[41:08.67]Which one is better for me?
[41:12.79]Joke for me.
[41:14.67]Joke, please, joke for me.
[41:18.17]What a fraud.
[41:19.55]Great setup.
[41:20.47]It was the time.
[41:21.18]I don't even, I don't remember what my other one was.
[41:23.76]Let's keep things going for the next comment.
[41:25.16]I want it to redo.
[41:26.28]Okay, we're playing this game again.
[41:28.50]Yeah, now that we all understand, I'm not gonna let this smug-ass parrot.
[41:33.14]My family is like Bigfoot.
[41:36.63]They don't photograph well.
[41:38.69]Is that auto-generated?
[41:43.68]Yeah, that seems like a joke for me.
[41:47.00]Alright, Jerma's going to take them down.
[41:49.58]Here we go.
[41:49.92]Spit some fire.
[41:50.56]It's a big reveal.
[41:51.64]Let's go.
[41:52.62]People think this is whatever.
[41:56.06]My doctor said I have a bad case of the soap operas because I'm the cleanest I've ever been.
[42:02.94]Alright.
[42:16.68]It wasn't an auto joke.
[42:19.42]Well, that's... I guess I have to pick.
[42:22.36]No, it tells you after the vote, I think.
[42:24.82]If it was.
[42:25.72]What?
[42:26.60]Yeah, it stamps it after.
[42:28.02]See?
[42:28.24]That was a joke for me.
[42:29.20]Yeah, you guys voted for the auto joke.
[42:31.47]Yeah, yours was bad.
[42:33.25]Your doctor says you have a bad case of being clean.
[42:36.84]A bad case of being clean, Joe.
[42:39.00]That's the point.
[42:39.62]I can't pick the prompt.
[42:40.18]Make some noise for our next comment.
[42:42.38]I just have to... I don't choose the prompt.
[42:44.80]You did get to choose the prompt.
[42:46.80]In a way.
[42:47.20]Wait, what?
[42:53.39]What's the difference between most people and people?
[42:55.69]And people has an N. What?
[42:58.13]Oh my god.
[43:00.73]It made no sense!
[43:01.93]I didn't pick the most people and people.
[43:06.08]Oh, she didn't get to pick the prompt.
[43:08.10]I didn't.
[43:11.04]It's very literal.
[43:16.18]He wrote the word boomer.
[43:17.18]He wins.
[43:19.12]Oh, man.
[43:20.30]First I compete against pee-pee-poo-poo, and now I compete against boomer?
[43:24.06]So old, I remember when Elbertson was a boomer.
[43:26.86]Click it!
[43:27.69]Everybody click it!
[43:34.00]I forgive you, though, Ashley, because you had my top joke of the entire thing, which was, I remember people, the rat meat thing.
[43:41.94]Thank you.
[43:42.58]I'm here for you.
[43:43.82]Oh my god, you won anyway.
[43:46.31]Nice assist!
[43:47.43]Assist?
[43:49.77]What do you mean, assist?
[43:52.11]Thank you, Chet.
[43:53.83]This is a horrible cut-up.
[43:55.51]Let's see.
[43:56.03]If you're at the bottom, fret not, or all mortal souls will eventually perish.
[44:04.49]I'd be both of you.
[44:08.53]How about that?
[44:24.20]Well, we're sinking again.
[44:25.68]There's no time to write jokes from scratch.
[44:27.70]So, here's the plan.
[44:29.06]Let's rewrite another comic's joke.
[44:31.14]You'll use the same setup, but we'll attempt to write a funnier punchline.
[44:35.49]The better the original joke did, the more points you'll earn for beating it.
[44:39.15]Can you steal the spotlight before the boat sinks?
[44:42.11]Let's find out.
[44:42.83]I think I understand.
[45:09.33]Wait that was me like mine was mine was me responding to it I'm sorry.
[45:16.61]I fucked it up.
[45:17.59]I would that was me respond whatever.
[45:19.85]I can't believe I wasted my joke on this Me too, I was like responding fuck whatever Okay, I'll be clear when my joke comes up It's not me telling the joke
[45:35.95]It's Dennis.
[45:37.47]Wrong sign.
[45:41.30]It's a character thing.
[45:43.58]Then that still doesn't help.
[45:46.04]Hello?
[45:48.40]Is that your way to pass off like an offensive joke or something?
[45:51.92]No.
[45:54.17]It's not me doing it.
[45:55.75]It's not me writing this.
[45:58.33]It's my character saying this.
[46:14.72]Well, full redo.
[46:15.65]We're going to the next game after this.
[46:17.77]No, no.
[46:18.51]Oh no, I still finished mine.
[46:20.19]Just like the shit.
[46:21.49]One last time for our performers.
[46:22.79]Wait, you didn't finish?
[46:29.40]No.
[46:29.54]Here's the number one.
[46:32.02]What's the difference between most people and people?
[46:36.90]I am accordingly squapping is the same word, dummy.
[46:45.30]Oh no, he got scooped.
[46:47.15]Well, obviously, isn't this not fair to the original comedian?
[46:53.09]Because they have time to figure out what they want to say.
[46:55.06]Yeah, this seems lopsided.
[47:01.34]Like, you can replace him.
[47:02.96]Also, like, in the world of comedy, I just feel like bro Baruto just ripped off Ashley, and he loses a lot of points for even trying to reiterate.
[47:12.39]Oh, I still won!
[47:13.45]Yeah, screw that guy.
[47:14.67]He just stole your joke.
[47:16.78]Well, we're all stealing jokes here.
[47:18.76]Yeah, that's just not cool.
[47:20.84]Remember when that one comedian did that?
[47:23.44]My love life is like Napoleon.
[47:26.14]It's significantly shorter than I would have wanted.
[47:32.72]I mean, I don't know.
[47:35.35]It is.
[47:37.07]A real Clash of the Titans.
[47:39.57]This map is pretty good.
[47:54.68]sorry sorry I also I picked really bad nouns in the beginning but one of the questions was two spoons walk into a bar I gotta take responsibility for writing the word spoon you don't make spoons alright let's see oh god no is it oh god no I call my bedroom no no no don't
[48:24.08]It's not a joke.
[48:25.30]It's not a joke.
[48:29.00]I'm voting for Satan.
[48:31.88]No, that's way better.
[48:32.94]Look at that little face.
[48:36.09]It's not me writing this.
[48:39.41]It's somebody else.
[48:41.25]They're both good.
[48:42.25]I can watch a lot of Always Sunny and remembering how Dennis killed you is definitely a serial killer.
[48:46.88]Yeah, you have to read it in his voice.
[48:52.94]No, well, don't worry.
[48:57.20]Okay, let's all make fun of Jerma now.
[49:00.90]You're gonna laugh at my joke.
[49:01.96]Why are they called flat earthers?
[49:04.54]And not go read any book.
[49:07.00]Okay.
[49:12.04]Alright.
[49:14.68]That's the best one yet.
[49:16.34]I was merely responding.
[49:20.47]Alright, maybe phase two of the boat isn't that bad.
[49:23.11]You got some comedy.
[49:25.85]Any book?
[49:28.11]Easy win.
[49:29.03]Easy win.
[49:38.28]It's not a joke, but it's just a harsh truth.
[49:44.50]Alright, pick some like we got.
[49:46.86]Gurfers though, come on.
[49:50.67]Have you noticed how Mr. Peanut looks like... ...Fancier Jerma?
[49:59.10]No.
[50:02.08]What?
[50:03.32]Well, you said the name of the streamer, so... I don't know, it's gonna be tight!
[50:07.34]Nah, that's a peanut in a suit.
[50:09.22]I wrote Peanut.
[50:10.04]I wrote Peanut.
[50:11.40]He wrote Peanut.
[50:22.88]Oh my god, Pinu wins.
[50:24.24]45-55.
[50:24.90]Ow, you beat the wrappers.
[50:30.17]So, barely.
[50:31.11]Lost to Pinu.
[50:39.97]Alright.
[50:40.23]Stop typing in the middle of it!
[50:42.43]My doctor said I have a bad case of the soap operas.
[50:45.11]Because he doesn't have a real me-you-know-what-I-mean?
[50:51.97]No, I didn't write, you know what I mean.
[50:54.03]I just dropped in the middle of typing medical license.
[50:57.69]I do that all the time, though.
[50:59.53]I hate to have that, but hey, you know what I mean?
[51:01.90]You guys know what I mean?
[51:02.68]I do that all the fucking time.
[51:05.62]What the fuck just happened?
[51:07.96]It added, you know what I mean, on the end, because I didn't finish it.
[51:10.16]I know, but, like, I'm still trying to... People voted for it, and that's even worse.
[51:20.00]Whoever you are, you're a hero.
[51:21.18]And me.
[51:21.83]And you know what, Jerm, I got you more points.
[51:26.61]Thank you.
[51:26.95]I appreciate it.
[51:28.21]Yeah, just throwing.
[51:29.65]Throwing.
[51:30.51]I'm a nasty little dry erase board.
[51:34.34]Because dear God, this joke is so bad, I can't even save it.
[51:40.32]How do you not understand?
[51:42.32]What's not to understand?
[51:44.78]Explain it.
[51:45.80]I can't.
[51:46.38]I'm not going to explain this joke.
[51:47.67]I'm a nasty dry erase board.
[51:50.35]Because.
[51:51.91]Right.
[51:52.91]But you can't be a dry erase board if you're right.
[51:55.57]But that's why.
[51:56.21]That's the joke.
[51:57.35]Because it's sexual.
[52:00.63]I can't even pick.
[52:01.51]I didn't pick.
[52:02.99]How am I going to explain this?
[52:05.21]I mean, I get where you're going, but it doesn't make any sense.
[52:09.41]It's like it doesn't work.
[52:11.17]Oh, he beat you.
[52:16.21]I wasn't expecting that.
[52:21.47]I like my friends, I like my cars.
[52:23.49]Rumors only.
[52:32.12]That's gonna be tough.
[52:33.34]We've got two stream references.
[52:35.84]Compact Guy is the original car jokesman.
[52:45.78]this dude doesn't get the average gamer oh it's pretty split no that was like that was pretty close which comedian is leaving with me in the lifeboat let's find out who deserves it the most that's kind of scary
[53:14.67]wow okay we actually if we voted against compact car guy then Jerma would have won yeah oh well that was fun alright let's go to the next one we can do it again we'll do we'll do this one again like after we go we need the redo new players hold on wait whoa whoa
[53:43.14]I'm in control.
[53:44.20]Oh, yeah, you are in control.
[53:46.61]Oh, well, I clicked new players and it disconnected me.
[53:49.99]Alright, fine.
[53:51.03]Tell me when to join and I'll behave.
[53:52.67]Alright.
[53:53.63]Behave.
[53:53.83]Here we go.
[53:56.25]Don't do it yet.

[54:06.62]Toot!
[54:07.04]Toot!
[54:07.48]We gotta scoot!
[54:09.86]Everyone, you know, think up some funny nouns.

[54:41.99]Me and Ashley changed... We all changed bodies.
[54:47.20]This is how it was supposed to be.
[54:49.50]Just like in Troy.
[54:50.44]We don't have all day!
[54:51.54]Bagel Boy.
[55:00.57]One more!
[55:00.93]Uh-oh.
[55:02.83]Uh-oh.
[55:06.45]Okay, I just realized... Jerma put... Jerma put what?

[55:17.76]Well, you need to click everyone's ready.
[55:20.30]I know.
[55:20.50]Because you've got max players.
[55:21.80]Just making sure.
[55:22.44]Because you haven't done it yet.
[55:24.10]I got it.
[55:24.38]Which is... You better not talk to me once.
[55:26.66]Let's retag it.
[55:27.68]Yeah, everyone... this is writer's room silence.
[55:33.05]Quiet chat.
[55:34.07]Oh, Jeremy put Sun Chips in F tier.
[55:35.77]Let me ask both of you questions really quickly.
[55:38.31]Are Sun Chips good?
[55:40.21]Would you pick Sun Chips?
[55:41.45]Okay.
[55:41.65]Okay, there we go.
[55:42.65]Star.
[56:19.28]Really?
[56:19.82]Okay, I guess it makes sense.
[56:25.32]Just like my premium cable bundle, this writing exercise is ending soon.
[56:34.75]Now it's time to write some comedy.
[56:36.47]Follow the steps on your device to construct two jokes.
[56:40.11]I think it'll do minus twoing, but nobody did anything.
[56:49.06]You talked about Sunchips.
[56:50.84]Oh, I said the word Sunchip?
[56:53.40]Yeah.
[56:56.89]I ain't picking that one.
[56:59.46]Oh, God, I should not have picked this.
[57:00.88]The only jokes I can think of are very bad.
[57:03.44]Don't.
[57:03.92]Stop it.
[57:05.06]Don't.
[57:05.46]Get out.
[57:06.61]I will censor your joke.
[57:08.01]I'm not doing it, but I just, like, I am in a situation now where this is very difficult to not make this awful.
[57:15.55]Don't do it.
[57:16.55]Skip.
[57:17.11]Do something else.
[57:19.67]Oh, God.
[57:32.38]I'm sorry.
[57:35.42]I'm fucking around.
[57:36.81]I will actually boot you from this call.
[57:39.49]And I will boot you from this.
[57:40.91]I will censor you.
[57:41.85]I will do it.
[57:44.87]Don't make me do it.
[57:45.79]I gotta do a joke.
[57:50.14]Okay, you should be starting on your second joke soon if you haven't already.
[57:53.36]Fuck.
[58:04.84]Oh, God.
[58:05.20]What am I gonna write for this fucking thing?
[58:07.04]I, uh... This is also awful.
[58:10.69]Yeah, it is.
[58:11.45]This isn't, like, bad awful.
[58:13.61]This is, uh... I, uh... Whatever.
[58:19.55]I don't care.
[58:21.23]These two are such bad prompts.
[58:36.71]Um... Time's running out!
[58:42.96]Submit what you can!
[58:43.90]This is... This is... It's not so good!
[58:52.90]I don't know whatever I don't whatever I don't care mine are terrible looks like some of you didn't finish your jokes too bad god this is gonna be worse than the first one I can just you know I yeah I am ready I'm ready to get rid of it wow talk about close quarters why are all the setups the same again dang it chuck you screwed it I got like the exact same one here's our first comic
[59:22.39]How many boomers does it take to change a light bulb?
[59:25.69]Three.
[59:26.15]One to screw it in, and two to complain about millennials.
[59:29.39]Is that auto-generated?
[59:34.55]It's definitely not, but that's so bad it's an autocomplete.
[59:39.17]That's a spicy controversy.
[59:40.92]What's the difference between most people and sheep?
[59:46.34]Most people have their own opinions.
[59:52.64]He told it backwards.
[59:54.08]Well, you don't get to choose the first half.
[59:58.04]I don't even have a choice.
[60:23.11]I do believe you're owed some points.
[60:25.07]Why?
[60:25.81]Because why boomers?
[60:27.13]I don't understand.
[60:27.65]A round of applause for our next comedian.
[60:31.59]Hi, Jerma.
[60:31.93]You're muted.
[60:33.07]Why do you keep doing that?
[60:33.90]Wait, what?
[60:34.42]Because the letter L. I'm so old, I remember when Doopie... Doopie?
[60:41.06]We called jermaOn a good one.
[60:42.58]What does that mean?
[60:44.24]What's Doopie?
[60:45.14]It asked me to type in a person's name, and I got confused, and I wrote Doopie for a person, and then he picked that one.
[60:51.63]Doopie?
[60:52.52]That's your fault.
[60:53.34]Yeah, that's my fault.
[60:58.81]These are the worst things I've ever thought of.
[61:02.25]Marriage is a lot like church.
[61:03.63]You didn't finish this one!
[61:05.25]You know what I mean?
[61:05.91]I mean, that's funny in its own way, but I don't want to... You know what I mean?
[61:11.48]You know what I mean?
[61:12.58]Oh, God.
[61:33.78]It's so funny, like, you know that there's something wrong when, you know, there's like random chat members here that could write crazy shit.
[61:42.36]And I'm concerned about the guy in the call writing the crazy shit.
[61:47.47]You're gonna read my jokes.
[61:49.99]I was gonna write gross.
[61:51.59]You gotta write shit.
[61:52.29]A group of fucks walk into a bar and tell the bartender, sorry for the wrecks.
[61:57.37]Oh.
[61:59.87]I'm fine.
[62:00.25]I don't know where he got it.
[62:07.79]I'm so dumb, I thought mice were capable of feeling love.
[62:15.33]Dude, you're up against the truck, I'm fine.
[62:16.79]That's just not true.
[62:19.29]That's just not true.
[62:20.05]Is this like a furry thing?
[62:40.15]Imagine fighting the truck punchline.
[62:42.03]Yeah, you gotta go to jackbox.TV and then put in the code.
[62:50.70]H-J-I-I.
[62:53.76]Alright, let's hear it for the next performer.
[62:56.24]I hope I'm up against you.
[62:57.40]I want to take you down.
[62:58.72]It's guaranteed to win.
[63:00.08]I'm guaranteed to win because I'm going to just censor yours, so it's okay.
[63:03.44]Oh yeah, don't forget to say your catchphrase.
[63:06.70]This is bad.
[63:07.34]I didn't have any time.
[63:08.53]Why did the weighted blanket cross the road?
[63:12.55]It didn't.
[63:13.35]It's a weighted blanket.
[63:14.79]Oh my god.
[63:16.21]I had- I was too busy.
[63:17.89]Look.
[63:18.21]Oh my god.
[63:18.73]Put me up against this guy.
[63:20.11]I was too busy yelling at you to not be offensive on stream.
[63:25.40]I wasn't.
[63:27.44]We were typing, remember?
[63:29.16]My joke was very appropriate.
[63:31.55]um in good taste I have more convertibles than a person who thinks rain is a myth that's not very many people though you don't have you have like none how many do you have zero imagine when jarmo wins this one yeah nice they give him the softball
[63:56.37]Oh, it's comedy battle night.
[63:57.61]Let's bring Jerma985 up and his opponent a beach ball.
[64:02.58]Woohoo!
[64:05.18]I still win.
[64:05.96]Oh, he was a joke for me.
[64:08.60]I still win.
[64:09.06]I still win.
[64:10.08]I still win.
[64:10.82]I still win.
[64:11.58]I still win.
[64:14.18]Bagel boy.
[64:16.18]Okay, up next.
[64:18.92]Bagel boy.
[64:24.68]Great, you had one zinger so far.
[64:25.96]Let's see what you got now.
[64:26.72]My love life is like the Hulk.
[64:28.56]I feel nothing but frustration.
[64:35.27]Give me body wash?
[64:38.09]What?
[64:38.25]I don't even...
[64:43.11]I don't know why I'd ask if you're ready.
[64:44.39]These are both very literal and... Just go.
[64:47.57]Just don't.
[64:48.33]It's just gonna go.
[64:48.81]You can explain the joke.
[64:49.95]Don't have to.
[64:50.99]My nickname is Plunger because I love my work as a plumber.
[64:54.01]It's just... Deva!
[64:58.59]You're horrible.
[65:02.86]I set you up with a funny toilet object and you give me that.
[65:06.14]That was not my attention.
[65:07.94]I don't have my full attention on the game.
[65:10.00]Did you?
[65:10.48]I wrote Plunger.
[65:12.45]I wrote Plunger.
[65:13.17]Did we both write Plunger?
[65:14.54]I think we both wrote Plunger.
[65:16.14]Did you even try?
[65:18.00]Not really.
[65:18.48]What?
[65:19.00]Wow.
[65:19.92]All of the nouns in the world and we both picked Plunger.
[65:22.95]Holy shit.
[65:25.55]And Jerma fucked it up.
[65:27.41]Yeah.
[65:28.72]no alright so let me just let me I gotta defend myself our next comic to the stage during this you were going during this whole time you were going oh I can't write this oh no no I'm guy I'm in trouble have you tried it have you ever tried trucking that's when you have given up I gave up on the joke
[65:51.23]I got a goddamn stream to run, and you're sitting there going, whoa, this is going to get a TOS.
[65:57.80]I want to open a store that only sells Cheetos and call it Cheesy Jerma Boomers R Us.
[66:02.72]Well, fuck, I'm censoring you.
[66:06.94]Do you have a censor button?
[66:12.00]Oh, he does.
[66:12.52]Oh, my God.
[66:13.92]Don't censor me.
[66:15.16]Oh, my God.
[66:16.80]Ashley just keeps giving up.
[66:18.02]Yeah.
[66:18.80]Squeaking through.
[66:21.75]You better not censor mine.
[66:23.29]I'm going to censor it.
[66:27.84]This better not be bad.
[66:30.68]I'm going to be actually IRL upset.
[66:33.14]Get out of here.
[66:33.92]You're out.

[67:20.86]Wait, wait.
[67:21.50]This better be like a knock-knock joke.
[67:24.68]If this ain't like a... I'm a nasty little Rubik's Cube.
[67:43.39]You're just gonna censor everyone until you win and feel good about yourself?
[67:46.35]Who is currently winning comedy?
[67:49.09]Let's see.
[67:49.55]Oh, who's winning comedy?

[67:59.02]I won.
[67:59.82]How?
[68:05.66]Alright, here's where it really matters.
[68:08.72]I got my finger on the button.

[68:41.74]Let's go with this one.
[68:45.32]Oh, that's terrible.
[68:49.68]Okay, I have a minute.
[69:22.93]Jerma is allowed to sexualize dry erase boards, but Kurt Starr can't make a sexy Rubik's Cube joke.
[69:29.19]Exactly.
[69:30.72]Someone gets it.
[69:32.82]Get out of here!
[69:35.02]Jerma was the original R-rated joke.
[69:37.12]Alright, after your first fucking material there, I had the- I ain't- excuse me.
[69:45.05]Are we just pretending like the first one didn't exist?
[69:49.11]I don't even hear you.
[69:50.65]You're muted again because you typed in L. Well, just turn on the stream.
[69:55.31]Women and children go in the lifeboats first.
[69:58.13]Everyone else, stick around and welcome back our performers!
[70:02.42]What about the Bob?
[70:03.12]That was just accidental.
[70:04.08]I've deleted like 30 videos accidentally.
[70:05.96]I'm accidentally gonna mute someone.
[70:09.44]Marriage is a lot like germs.
[70:10.68]It makes you sick.
[70:13.62]That's pretty good.
[70:15.04]That's a pretty good PG 1950s comedy.
[70:19.33]Did they successfully beat this joke?
[70:21.63]You know what I mean?
[70:23.53]Marriage.
[70:34.10]It's the same joke, but just told differently.
[70:36.22]Yeah, that's the beauty of comedy.
[70:43.51]Oh, yeah.
[70:43.71]You're going to win this.
[70:45.51]You didn't do anything.
[70:46.53]I didn't do anything.
[70:51.35]Alright, Bagel Boy, what do you got?
[70:55.98]I'm a nasty little tornado because I spin out of control like this game of Joke Boat has.
[71:08.32]There it is.
[71:09.56]Which punch line is better?
[71:13.47]Because I... Oh, he's up against the captain?
[71:16.44]Yeah.
[71:17.78]Because that's... That could be Star's joke number one.
[71:22.94]That I censored.
[71:23.56]Could be one of the three I censored.
[71:25.79]No.
[71:26.67]No, he's like up against the AI.
[71:28.83]Yeah, because I deleted three jokes.
[71:33.15]Oh.
[71:33.71]They don't even get to go up against mine again.
[71:36.96]Because I was censored that much.
[71:39.32]You got a devil censored.
[71:42.90]Okay, so I just don't even exist anymore.
[71:46.62]You are, like, face down into water.
[71:49.06]People are stepping into your body to get out of it.
[71:56.48]He asked nicely.
[72:02.05]What?
[72:02.23]Kill him.
[72:02.67]That's way better than mine.
[72:11.27]Star, you're going to be really mad in about probably one to two minutes, I think.
[72:16.07]Why?
[72:16.27]Because you're going to censor me again?
[72:17.85]No, because there's nothing for you to censor.
[72:19.05]There's nothing for me to censor.
[72:20.95]But you're going to be very upset about this in particular.
[72:23.35]I'm just kind of seeing it already.
[72:25.59]Uh-oh.
[72:25.97]Oh, you lost.
[72:28.53]Yeah, you're about to be very angry.
[72:30.13]Did you just like take my joke and rewrite it?
[72:32.31]No.
[72:33.86]My love life is like the Hulk.
[72:37.16]Starts out small, but then it gets big and green.
[72:40.76]I should see a doctor.
[72:45.76]How come you get to keep writing sexual jokes?
[72:48.13]Yeah.
[72:57.73]Yeah, censor it.
[73:00.27]Go ahead.
[73:00.85]You can't.
[73:01.25]Yeah.

[73:02.77]I, I have all the power.
[73:04.71]That's my prize money.
[73:05.67]I have all the power here.
[73:11.52]Yeah, Luther.
[73:12.22]He's a hypocrite.

[73:21.59]I just stood up for my fucking throne.
[73:24.69]You don't make me stand up from the throne.
[73:28.09]You've tried trucking.
[73:29.35]That's when you and your truck friends all go to the bar.
[73:31.57]I like that one.
[73:32.15]Do you?
[73:35.45]No.
[73:38.01]Well, it's better than mine.
[73:43.63]So guaranteed.
[73:46.25]Jarrah was going crazy from the power.
[73:59.67]Aw, somebody won for me.
[74:04.53]He's rubbing his hands together.
[74:05.83]Have you heard about the Jackbox Challenge?
[74:13.47]That's where you censor everyone's answers until you win.
[74:18.55]It's funny because it's true.
[74:19.71]I mean, you asked for it.
[74:27.95]What?
[74:28.33]How?
[74:28.61]You're not supposed to be able to participate.
[74:30.05]What happened?
[74:30.95]What madness is this?
[74:33.01]My power!
[74:35.11]I'm so dumb.
[74:35.63]I thought mice were... What happened to my power?
[74:38.22]Laugh my ha-ha.

[74:55.72]There was nothing to censor.
[74:56.64]I mean, you just said it.
[74:57.88]I didn't see you have to do anything.
[75:01.64]Funny callback, though.

[75:23.03]Why did the weighted blanket cross the road?
[75:27.43]Couldn't wait any longer.
[75:29.51]You know what I mean?
[75:33.54]That's the best joke of the whole night.
[75:37.00]That's the best one of the whole night, without a doubt.
[75:41.56]You know what I mean, really.
[75:42.65]The end.
[75:43.25]The end really ties it all together, I think.

[80:55.44]Okay, so we have to do definition for that word.
[80:57.04]Alright, let's see.
[81:05.97]As long as you're using letters, you really can't mess this up too badly.
[81:16.66]I can't think of anything.
[81:18.66]It really is hard to come up with something that somebody throws at you.
[81:35.98]It would help if I know how to spell this word.
[81:37.40]That doesn't make any sense.
[81:46.32]You've got to submit very, very soon, like right now!
[81:49.90]I don't know.
[81:53.61]Everybody's reaction is always, I don't know.

[81:57.17]That's what the word means, I don't know.
[82:01.41]Show me the definitions!
[82:11.94]Large gathering of beers.

[82:29.63]All these answers are terrible.
[82:32.19]And remember, you can award bonus points to the ones that stole your heart.
[82:41.65]Are any of these supposed to be correct?
[82:44.53]No, you can't be correct, it's a made-of-word.
[82:49.81]It's not a real word.
[82:51.89]It's whichever one speaks to you.
[82:53.61]Come on, vote!
[82:54.85]What?
[82:55.35]It takes so long to decide?

[83:36.95]No more you know what I'm saying.
[83:38.07]These definitions are like children.
[83:39.71]Pick your favorite.
[83:41.27]Look at that chump over there.

[84:16.60]To chimp a chimp.
[84:17.72]Yeah, that kind of pulls it together.
[84:19.56]The audience likes a loser.

[87:53.71]Like you said, tell me a joke, son.

[92:59.20]So wait, what was wrong?
[93:00.32]We skipped this one.
[93:01.46]Why did we skip this one?
[93:02.56]Chad said it was dumb.
[93:05.04]Yeah, Chad said that one was very dumb.
[93:06.52]Should we even just do it?
[93:08.38]Wait, look, we have the pack.
[93:12.37]But it's dumb, and those other ones are so fun.
[93:15.31]I want to do Dictionarium again, now that I understand what's going on.
[93:19.47]Okay, can you guys, like, not define the wrong word and still win?
[93:23.97]There was two of them on the screen.

[97:04.24]Cake throat.
[97:07.02]Alright.
[97:08.40]You guys can see the game, right?
[97:10.96]So all I have to do is this.
[97:14.38]Don't join it yet when we get in first.
[97:15.80]No, although it really doesn't matter.
[97:20.94]It's just the four of us anyways.
[97:24.88]Just the four of us.
[97:26.82]You and I and I and I. Ronnie is fucking infected.
[97:31.50]What?
[97:33.38]It's making me Twitch login.
[97:34.54]How do I do that?
[97:35.14]Here we go.
[97:35.64]I'll log in real quick.
[97:36.86]Top left setting bar.
[97:38.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[97:38.65]Alright, here we go.
[97:39.77]That was easy peasy.
[97:42.75]Alright.
[97:46.41]So we're going to get a tutorial.
[97:49.13]We'll see how this works.
[97:52.09]Let's go.
[97:53.77]Everybody ready?
[97:55.52]This is MVM music.
[98:06.41]Oh, this one actually has an animated background.
[98:08.85]That's cool.
[98:09.71]Sorry to interrupt your cryo sleep, but I thought it worth mentioning that I, your digital officer during emergencies, or Dotty, have detected an alien biorhythm on this ship.
[98:21.06]and just as I suspected the aliens uploaded a virus which is slowly deleting my program I'm here to guide you through if you'd like uh we should probably figure out what the hell to do yeah guide me fill me dude I'm now initiating security protocol alpha bravo carrot which is a series of tests designed to evaluate your humanity and reveal any aliens hiding amongst you
[98:48.90]I have determined that one of you is secretly an alien please look at your device and confirm your identity your device can tell you if you're a human or an alien but not the identities of your fellow players figure out who okay
[99:11.55]By my calculations, you will have 12 minutes before I cease to be.
[99:15.41]12 minutes?
[99:15.73]So I'd appreciate it if you could figure out who the alien is, and then push the button.
[99:22.42]We're trying- we're killing each other?
[99:23.44]Yeah.
[99:24.28]You will be our first captain.
[99:28.70]I have repurposed the ship's quarters into unique testing areas.
[99:31.95]I'm pretty proud of it.
[99:33.29]Choose an available room and your desired participants.
[99:36.25]Oh, drawing quarters.
[99:37.29]You know what's going in there.
[99:38.49]Fucking artist.
[99:41.11]Let's break out the tablet.
[99:43.59]Get me in here.
[99:45.46]Wait.
[99:50.18]Don't invite Jerma.
[99:51.12]Hey!
[99:51.48]All the artists just gonna jerk off in the drawing room.
[99:54.94]The two artists go in the drawing room?
[99:56.64]Yeah, let's get drawing.
[99:58.54]Draw so much dicks.
[100:00.49]Where's the fucking loud talking clown room?
[100:02.79]Not fair.
[100:08.49]Oh, I gotta get my tablet.
[100:09.77]My tablet's not working.
[100:10.97]I don't have a tablet.
[100:13.39]Shoot.
[100:14.44]What are you guys doing in here?
[100:17.08]Hold on, how much time do we have?
[100:19.02]You got like 12 minutes before we all die.
[100:22.92]How much time do we have to draw?
[100:23.96]A minute?
[100:25.14]A minute and a half?
[100:25.92]Okay, here's my tablet.
[100:27.52]I'm trying to get it to work.
[100:28.34]It's not working.
[100:28.88]I don't understand what I'm supposed to be drawing.
[100:32.50]It says a thing.
[100:33.74]It says on top of your screen, like above the drawing it says.
[100:38.67]You'll understand what I mean when I don't understand what it wants me to draw.
[100:41.69]Hit the hurry up button.
[100:44.19]But when do I hit the hurry button?
[100:46.81]If you're dawdling with your doodling, how do kids tell if you're doodling?
[100:49.71]Go!
[100:50.23]I'm doodling.
[100:51.23]Doodles, doodles, doodles.
[100:53.83]Fast, fast, fast.
[100:56.87]Yes, that is Whomp Ronnie.
[100:58.58]It is.
[100:59.42]The real Whomp Ronnie.
[101:15.72]How are you guys doing?
[101:17.10]I did it.
[101:18.22]Okay.
[101:18.98]What did you do?
[101:19.50]What?
[101:27.45]Okay.
[101:29.63]Sick.
[101:30.33]And the human prompt was?
[101:31.99]Tra le miserab.
[101:36.13]And how did the subjects respond?
[101:37.99]I don't know what that is.
[101:41.26]Do any of these lenses seem suspicious?
[101:44.37]Keep in mind, someone may have gotten a bad prompt, or they could just be a terrible artist.
[101:50.11]That's Jean Valjean.
[101:53.69]He was a captain of Enterprise.
[101:55.56]I think you know how we draw.
[101:59.04]That's how we both draw.
[102:00.84]We're not aliens.
[102:01.28]What am I trying to pick here?
[102:02.66]You're trying to pick who the alien is.
[102:04.69]I think but why would uh what do you draw what are these are drawing tap the alien icon and any responses you don't trust the player seems to be taking way too long to move on you can tap the hurry up button to speed up the timer we're on the clock here people so let's keep it going I think you just wait out the timer oh yeah you can speed it up I'm speeding it up my tablet still isn't working I'm very sad
[102:32.61]Wait, you've been tested?
[102:33.81]Okay, next captain, you're in charge.
[102:35.58]Alright, you're the captain.
[102:38.20]Okay, let's get a move on.
[102:39.42]Pick another room.
[102:40.68]There's less than nine minutes.
[102:47.63]The alien's the captain.
[102:55.00]Welcome to the writing pod.
[102:56.82]We'll see who's really better at writing jokes.
[102:59.98]Answer honestly, because it will be scrutinized.
[103:03.36]The alien virus will allow the intruders to get something similar, but not quite right.
[103:08.19]When the correct prompt is revealed, it will be up to you to determine if any seem odd.
[103:16.63]As time winds down, I'll do my best to send the alien some real stinkers.
[103:20.53]It's the least I can do.
[103:23.40]okay so you draw stuff and then the computer let's see the human prompt the last movie I saw was
[103:46.20]Okay, what can we harp on?
[103:48.49]Look for any written answer that doesn't seem quite right.
[103:51.69]And don't forget to hit that suspicion button.
[103:59.20]That's, is that even a movie?
[104:04.67]I think you're supposed to give vague enough answers that, like, you... I think.
[104:10.23]Are you voting on me as alien?
[104:12.11]What?
[104:12.43]It seems I've underestimated the alien virus's capabilities.
[104:16.58]Aliens now have the ability to hack the prompts.
[104:19.24]I know what movies you've watched, okay?
[104:21.46]I know what you've seen recently.
[104:22.80]I have a log tutorial.
[104:23.70]An alien can select any human and secretly give them the alien prompt.
[104:29.63]to make things worse aliens can choose to help themselves and switch their own prompt I hope you got all of that because there's no way I'm repeating it Dr strange came out three years ago captain you're in charge yeah I just saw it like I I just watched it alright here we go you're picking drawing water no I'm not yeah I want to go to the place we haven't seen
[104:59.92]Husband versus wife.
[105:01.24]Deliberate off.
[105:02.04]Make your choice.
[105:03.06]Would you like to play a game?
[105:32.15]Finished.
[105:34.10]Only seven more minutes.
[105:37.34]Humans received.
[105:40.84]Every time you eat cheese, you destroy a small sentient universe.
[105:45.29]You must.
[105:48.85]Do any of these seem stinky?
[105:51.47]Now you have to decide who's an alien, or just makes terrible life decisions.
[105:55.79]And don't forget about those alien hacks.
[105:59.15]A smart alien can make someone look suspicious by flipping their prompts.
[106:09.98]I know that when you say something like, oh, Monopoly's my favorite board game, everybody goes, holy, come on, man.
[106:17.13]What about Settlers of Catan?
[106:19.71]um to me like this is the uh settlers so let's keep it going I kind of I kind of want to go back to monopoly but I would recommend you only do this game we're trying to find the alien suspicions okay next captain you're in charge because it's Ashley
[106:49.50]game's over because that is pretty quick to accuse the extraction room check it out I've stopped the timer it's costing me a lot of cpu but I don't want you to feel rushed since you were the one to push the button I think we're supposed to be talking remember you believe is an alien we are we're having a fun time yeah you're supposed to quiz people on what their answers were if you all vote yes last one and this player is an alien
[107:15.53]We're doing this so wrong.
[107:17.06]I'm not the alien.
[107:18.24]Why would you put me in here?
[107:19.24]I don't know.
[107:21.48]No, no, no, no.
[107:22.16]This is where we talk.
[107:23.58]I am not.
[107:24.70]I don't understand how the game works, but I know that I'm not the alien.
[107:27.87]So why did you put me in here?
[107:30.97]I want to see how it ends.
[107:34.09]The crew member who pushed the button can no longer push it.
[107:41.76]I also don't really understand the, uh, hacks.
[107:44.36]I guess you can change prompts?
[107:48.10]How do I push the button on someone?
[107:51.12]I think only the captain can do such stuff.
[107:54.72]Uh... Drawing?
[107:55.64]Ooh, I'm gonna go back to the drawing quarters.
[107:58.14]For my talent!
[107:58.96]Just because I like drawing.
[107:59.92]But I'm gonna bring... I'm suddenly suspicious of Ster here.
[108:04.14]two players to test oh okay another drawing test I approve you guys talked over the instructions I tried to tell them their drawings could reveal an alien oh I wanted to draw that's okay oh yeah
[108:32.39]Did I mention that if humans use all of their button pushes without success, you lose?
[108:36.80]Well, you do.
[108:50.48]two total hacks with four people that really doesn't hit as hard and you can push the button and vote at any time okay I see sorry if you heard that gulping it was pretty sexy though I'm like way down with my oh wait I can submit yeah yeah hit submit
[109:13.18]The prompt humans saw was... Draw shirtless Abe Lincoln.
[109:21.32]Shirtless?
[109:22.74]Ashley's has a shirt.
[109:25.23]Like, it's fucking... No, see, Ashley's is clearly wearing a shirt.
[109:29.57]Look at that.
[109:30.17]That's got a collar on it.
[109:31.29]I did not say shirtless.
[109:33.33]You're the alien.
[109:36.13]That's...
[109:41.52]I said, how do we push the button on her?
[109:43.88]Alien!
[109:44.36]No, you're the alien.
[109:50.24]I hope you're not wasting my time.
[109:51.70]This is General Abe Lincoln.
[109:54.10]Whom will you isolate?
[109:54.86]He generally wears clothes.
[109:55.87]You only get one minute, so act quickly.
[109:58.51]Okay, yeah, I want to, yeah.
[110:00.23]Okay, time to vote.
[110:02.83]Yes.
[110:04.39]Damn.
[110:04.95]Oh, come on, dude.
[110:06.85]The vote passed.
[110:08.44]This is what it's like to be in prison.
[110:10.12]So, is it- did we do it?
[110:12.21]Yeah.
[110:13.63]Well, I did.
[110:14.43]Because it wasn't me.
[110:18.33]It was Tom, I told you.
[110:19.55]Oh, they threw me, like, choking!
[110:22.20]I regret everything.
[110:23.20]Die, human!
[110:23.66]Well, good job, idiots.
[110:33.08]But you're an alien!
[110:34.68]I'm not!
[110:36.26]Why'd you draw a shirt?
[110:37.20]I thought this was just a tutorial, and that's what we were doing.
[110:39.34]It didn't say shirtless on it.
[110:40.70]Okay, I get it, so... Because Ronnie gave you the prompt to draw a shirt.
[110:43.82]Oh yeah, I'm dabbing.
[110:45.22]You got us all.
[110:46.54]Let's go.
[110:47.58]Dab.
[110:47.88]So who was it?
[110:51.28]It was Ronnie.
[110:52.06]Ronnie was the alien.
[110:52.86]It was me.
[110:53.96]Yeah.
[110:54.14]Oh.
[110:56.08]Because it told me to draw Hamilton and I thought they meant Alexander Hamilton and I drew just a dude with a slow patch.
[111:03.51]Because I don't know what Alexander Hamilton looks like.
[111:10.85]It was a play that was popular for like five minutes.
[111:15.03]Please look at your device and confirm your identity.
[111:19.71]Your device can tell you if you're...
[111:22.30]Alright, I'm gonna listen to the instructions.
[111:23.82]Yeah, we need to actually debate each other so we can figure it out.
[111:27.08]You guys were, like, silent after everything.
[111:29.66]Hold on, that whole time you were like, it's Ashley, it's Ashley, it's Ashley, just do it, it's Ashley, skip it, it's Ashley.
[111:35.20]That was because it was.
[111:35.90]The whole last ten minutes.
[111:37.26]It wasn't!
[111:39.04]Ashley and Ronnie were messaging each other.
[111:42.88]I've got too many windows open.
[111:46.33]Uh... Deliberation deck?
[111:48.15]Okay.
[111:50.11]Uh, two players to test.
[111:51.49]I want Jerma versus Ster, Jerma versus Ster.
[111:54.17]Why is Jerma versus Ster?
[111:56.18]Not the fucking aliens!
[111:59.78]Answer the question on your device.
[112:10.40]And the prompt for humans was...
[112:14.49]A hacker wants $50,000 or they will release your text messages to the world.
[112:19.37]You would say, and this is how the participants responded.
[112:22.91]Do any of these answers seem suspicious?
[112:28.86]Got something to hide, Trevor?
[112:33.70]You don't think you would say, like, hey, I want 50 grand.
[112:38.46]No, because I have nothing to hide.
[112:40.60]Well, neither do I, but what else do they have?
[112:45.66]If they get your text, they're in the cloud.
[112:46.94]They have everything else.
[112:47.90]They have all the pictures of you, like, bending over to look at your asshole.
[112:51.26]So they have all the pictures on your phone, too, and you don't want people to see that?
[112:54.74]For medical reasons, I need to look sometimes.
[112:58.30]I don't think you're an alien.
[112:59.28]I just think you've got some perverted shit on your phone.
[113:02.12]You talk a lot of stuff and censoring people for making sexual jokes.
[113:05.05]You want to give $50,000?
[113:06.15]Remember when you were sitting there with the bread loaf?
[113:10.62]I'm just saying, if they've got text messages, they've got, they've got like, they've got probably bank accounts.
[113:15.80]They're going to take the $50,000.
[113:17.92]Bring it down to $8,000 and I'll do it.
[113:20.32]New captain.
[113:21.17]Give someone $8,000.
[113:21.65]I'm not the fucking alien, alright?
[113:26.73]No, you're just the sick, sick man.
[113:30.89]Waiting pod.
[113:33.04]Waiting pod.
[113:40.16]I bet you're naked under all those clothes.
[113:41.84]Yeah.
[113:41.96]Um, what's that guy's name?
[113:43.60]Forget about under the clothes.
[113:45.39]I'm not even wearing any.
[114:08.19]That's common knowledge.
[114:14.75]And here's what humans saw.
[114:18.97]The actor or actress I want to play me in a movie is... Anything odd?
[114:28.82]What?
[114:29.42]That's pretty suspicious.
[114:30.94]Wouldn't it be awesome if Peter Dinklage played me?
[114:35.00]And everyone else in the movie acted like I was still me.
[114:39.47]Yeah, but that's, I mean.
[114:42.59]And they don't look down to make eye contact with him either.
[114:45.23]They're looking up because they see me, but it's Peter Dinklage.
[114:52.16]We're on the clock here, people, so let's keep it going.
[114:55.48]What?
[114:55.96]Why would he not be the... Because all these responses are very honest.
[114:59.58]Yeah, but that's a very clear, like, mind gymnastics.
[115:05.02]That's 100% my answer.
[115:06.40]Like, if I had the power, it's him.
[115:07.79]Yes, exactly.
[115:09.07]He has to do that role.
[115:10.33]His agent comes to him with these, like, no, no, God.
[115:13.45]And they force him to the drawing quarters.
[115:19.21]Drawing quarters?
[115:19.91]I don't want to draw.
[115:22.11]I'm sorry you keep getting left out of these, Jerma, but...
[115:25.28]I'm fine.
[115:25.60]It's art battle.
[115:26.54]Ashley needs to.
[115:27.10]Hey, thank you.
[115:27.54]You have entered the drawing quarters.
[115:29.40]Alright, here we go.
[115:30.46]I just got to come up with a grant.
[115:33.04]Draw the prompt on your device.
[115:35.90]I'm getting hacked.
[115:37.48]What does it mean when it says total hacks at the bottom?
[115:45.60]I think it's the amount of times the alien can interfere.
[115:50.98]I wouldn't know.
[115:51.58]I'm just guessing.
[116:03.04]If they're taking too long to draw, the hurry up button can help pick up the pace.
[116:11.09]Do I get a hurry up button?
[116:13.57]That's the total hacks, not hacks used.
[116:15.13]It's way at the bottom left for me.
[116:16.57]Hold on, so whoever the alien is has already done two hacks.
[116:21.07]That's the total amount of hacks, total.
[116:24.55]Not how many you have left.
[116:25.51]Yeah.
[116:27.43]Somebody is fucking with us.
[116:29.58]Is that one guy?
[116:32.78]That's completely wrong.
[116:34.06]We've only had two events so far.
[116:37.41]So I had it right the first time.
[116:38.55]So that's the amount of hacks that are available.
[116:41.77]I'll be honest, I don't know how the hacks work.
[116:43.51]I don't know what they're for.
[116:46.41]It's to mix, like to make a human get an alien prompt.
[116:50.98]Or like switch it around so a human looks like an alien.
[116:53.88]Gotcha.
[116:56.54]You read it wrong.
[116:57.18]You are the one guy.
[116:59.06]Well, let's see it in the chat.
[117:00.00]What the fuck?
[117:05.97]And the human prompt was... Draw yourself in the future.
[117:11.95]Oh my god, no way.
[117:15.06]What do we think?
[117:15.78]I mean, Ronnie, what's going on here?
[117:22.92]I have no idea!
[117:24.32]It said draw myself in the future, and I thought Dragon Ball is just a super future, maybe I'll be... I have no idea where I'm going with this.
[117:34.12]because I thought once after I drew him with his hands up it reminded me of that meme image the the fallout guy I was just me I was just memeing I'm sorry alien alien I don't know I mean ronnie would draw himself as vegeta in the future but the hold up
[117:55.77]It's not adding up, man.
[117:56.58]And everyone knows you don't write words when you're doing draw my thing or draw anything.
[118:01.78]That's a good point.
[118:03.06]That's a really good point.
[118:03.87]And only an alien would not know to not write words.
[118:07.63]Yeah, let's Ster in my picture.
[118:08.97]We're on a dolphin.
[118:10.53]nice also this is really funny to me because anytime for years when someone's drawing something I tell them to draw me for the future or draw yourself for the future and Ashley got to do it why can't emergencies have calm alarms next captain I uh I'm gonna go ahead uh there's a the buy this whoa hold on a minute here there's a bioscanner
[118:39.05]What's the bioscanner?
[118:40.19]Put Ronnie in the car.
[118:41.13]Scan me.
[118:41.97]Let's scan him.
[118:43.35]Come on, do it.
[118:51.58]This is the bioscanner.
[118:53.14]Good luck.
[118:53.74]I hope you've chosen a team you can trust.
[118:55.04]Oh, you didn't put yourself in, did you?
[118:56.58]Captain, I'm sending you the correct glyphs now.
[118:58.74]I don't think you can.
[119:01.14]Wait, I gotta, hold on.
[119:02.40]I need to look at this.
[119:03.48]Wait, what is happening?
[119:06.10]Uh, hold on.
[119:11.97]Describe your glyphs, Jerma.
[119:13.69]No.
[119:14.23]You have to... Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[119:16.59]Describe the symbols!
[119:18.20]What do you mean, no?
[119:19.18]Okay.
[119:19.28]Alright, so we got... Describe the symbols below that... Okay, so we've got... I got a... Jerma's an alien.
[119:27.26]Hold on.
[119:28.10]Person standing at a bus stop.
[119:32.15]Is one of them.
[119:33.35]We also have man falling down.
[119:36.25]Or man diving.
[119:37.21]Man diving.
[119:39.46]And we also have a conjoined twin.
[119:47.00]Conjoined twin.
[119:52.67]So we have man standing at bus stop, like actual bus stop, like the bus stop, man falling straight down or diving, and then conjoined twins.
[120:03.24]Okay.
[120:05.76]Okay.
[120:07.16]Alright.
[120:07.40]How we doing?
[120:09.33]You hit a button?
[120:10.91]Yeah, hurry up.
[120:11.63]I'm done.
[120:13.31]Okay.
[120:14.81]What do we got?
[120:15.99]The test has failed.
[120:17.31]What?
[120:21.68]Did we both get it wrong?
[120:22.62]Okay, that was suspicious.
[120:24.30]Maybe test humans next time.
[120:26.16]Hold on a second.
[120:31.34]This one's hard.
[120:32.37]Okay, so...
[120:34.65]might have been it hold on star what he said man diving man diving the man falling down diving is the middle one here people so let's keep it going me and ronnie have just about the same ones but we were super con like yeah I think we were different on the match what you were saying I think we just differed there
[120:54.52]Yeah, the man falling down was the one that I didn't quite... Well, because mine's pointing... My diving and falling down, and you have a man going up in the air.
[121:04.44]You have a man falling down on your panel star.
[121:06.67]Why did you not pick it?
[121:09.36]Which one is the man falling down?
[121:10.94]The one literally right next to it.
[121:13.58]On the right.
[121:14.10]What?
[121:16.32]Which one?
[121:16.82]The two-headed thing.
[121:18.22]No, Star, on your... Look at it in the middle.
[121:21.44]You have that in the middle.
[121:22.46]You picked the right one.
[121:23.76]My middle selected one with the Three Fingers going down was my man falling down.
[121:28.19]Next captain, please.
[121:30.35]Why is it going up?
[121:31.45]You had one going down.
[121:33.55]There's less than three minutes.
[121:35.17]Let's not go to the bioscanner again.
[121:36.53]Oh, we only have two minutes?
[121:39.33]Oh.
[121:39.95]Oh, gosh.
[121:40.53]OK.
[121:41.63]Drawing.
[121:41.93]I'm going to get Jerma in on this one and Ashley.
[121:44.87]Let's go.
[121:45.75]Come on.
[121:46.35]Drawing is the longest one.
[121:47.55]I'm sorry, Stuart.
[121:48.13]Have you even gotten to draw?
[121:49.11]I had a previous one.
[121:52.45]OK.
[121:54.08]Draw response.
[121:57.68]Draw.
[121:58.06]I'm thinking it's Jerma.
[121:59.86]Give me a thing to draw.
[122:01.44]It's tiny text above the drawing thing.
[122:04.12]It's real tiny.
[122:12.90]Ronnie, hurry him.
[122:13.66]You have a hurry button on the bottom left.
[122:15.22]We don't have time for that.
[122:16.57]Alright, hurry up.
[122:25.99]No!
[122:26.43]No, no, no!
[122:26.81]Get rid of that!
[122:27.21]You should probably stop drawing me so weird.
[122:38.00]I just had fun drawing you.
[122:41.58]The more details you add, the more trouble it can get.
[122:46.23]I ran out of time.
[122:47.45]Draw a mirror.
[122:50.13]Draw a mirror.
[122:53.89]Do any of these answers help?
[122:58.12]None of those makes... Oh, I get Ashleys.
[123:01.46]I was probably the alien.
[123:03.64]Yeah.
[123:04.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:05.46]Hold on a second here.
[123:06.68]I got fucking hacked.
[123:08.28]I got- listen to me.
[123:08.98]Don't do it yet.
[123:09.68]I got hacked.
[123:11.14]I got hacked.
[123:11.72]I got hacked.
[123:12.88]It told me to draw a magic portal.
[123:17.52]So I was making a guy- I was gonna have a magician in there.
[123:20.64]A magic portal.
[123:22.32]Why would I draw a big circle like that?
[123:24.10]What?
[123:24.38]How do we pick the guy?
[123:26.24]Wait, no.
[123:26.62]It's Jerma there.
[123:30.04]Yeah, it's him.
[123:30.74]No, it's not me.
[123:31.88]You're a portal.
[123:32.71]Hold up on Vegeta.
[123:33.85]You don't write hold up.
[123:35.05]You don't write hold up on Vegeta.
[123:36.75]That's right.
[123:37.51]What?
[123:38.31]Wait a minute.
[123:38.99]Hold on.
[123:39.37]Star, why are you... Star is incredibly gung-ho about this whole thing.
[123:43.25]Why?
[123:45.07]Who put... Did you... It's just either you were... You drew a black hole.
[123:52.30]There's still two hacks.
[123:53.22]Get Star in there.
[123:54.00]No, get Star in there.
[123:54.64]Get him in there.
[123:55.32]Unless it doesn't tell you if a hack was used.
[123:58.22]Steve's answers were so honest.
[124:00.37]Oh, no, they were not.
[124:01.99]Yes, they were.
[124:02.71]Peter Dinklage.
[124:03.35]Come on.
[124:04.41]Peter Dinklage.
[124:05.23]Yeah, absolutely.
[124:06.37]He's trying to put me under the bus, kill him.
[124:08.11]Yeah, and it was Star.
[124:09.99]Good work, everybody.
[124:11.31]Nice work.
[124:11.85]You killed an innocent man.
[124:14.42]Oh.
[124:19.02]It's Ronnie.
[124:20.08]I just don't know how the UI works to get Ronnie in there instead.
[124:24.00]Well...
[124:29.42]I don't know how the UI works.
[124:32.66]We had 20 seconds left.
[124:34.47]In 20 seconds, I'm going to figure out how to get Ronnie in that room.
[124:37.17]I don't know how it works.
[124:38.57]I'll just take a bed and kill Jerma.
[124:41.05]You could have just voted for me, and then the vote would have canceled.
[124:44.71]Well, no, the vote that I had was no or yes for Jerma.
[124:47.43]That's all I had.
[124:48.15]Then you hit no, and that would have been it.
[124:50.45]Yeah, well, I mean, I figured that's what I'm saying, is I don't know how long it would have taken to set up the Ronnie vote, because I don't like this game.
[124:59.38]It even needs more people.
[125:02.83]Yeah, I think it'd be harder.
[125:04.61]I think it'd be fun if it was... I mean, it's still interesting, but with like... Maybe like six people I think would be perfect.
[125:13.56]Yeah.
[125:14.50]Ten people would be too crazy.
[125:24.29]I don't know.
[125:24.95]I completely flubbed that because it said draw yourself.
[125:28.51]It didn't say draw yourself in the future.
[125:30.55]It just said draw yourself.
[125:31.99]Because I thought, why would it make me draw myself?
[125:36.79]I'm the alien.
[125:37.75]It's lying to me.
[125:38.95]I'll draw something else and talk my way out of it.
[125:41.27]So I said, alright, I'll draw Vegeta because maybe it'll say what's the last movie you saw or something.
[125:46.45]and I'm like okay I could just say obviously anything in your life you could relate to Dragon Ball so it was a good play yeah alright uh you guys want to do one more before because I got to get going soon yeah yeah yeah let's do one more of this so you want to go back and do like the dictionary one I feel like we need a round two for dictionary uh streamer's choice yep yeah I feel hold on let me see streamer's choice
[126:10.37]Do you want me to leave for the next one?
[126:12.49]Nah, you're a winner.
[126:13.93]Okay.
[126:14.53]I mean, you were the alien and killed us all twice.
[126:17.29]I know, I won.
[126:17.99]We haven't even seen this one.
[126:21.25]Is this one really that bad to, like, not even play it once in the whole pack?
[126:28.27]Why don't we just do it?
[126:29.65]We're gonna do it.
[126:33.05]I mean, we're just gonna play Jackbox 6 and just skip one of the whole games in here?
[126:38.68]we gotta put a nut in to make the others feel better yeah it's actually okay with four people so we just don't just do this with four people don't it just have to be a private game it'll be worse with chip okay alright screw you chet alright so also your jokes were so last time I need to do something to like fix this
[127:03.14]Me?
[127:03.50]What?
[127:04.24]Those were bad jokes.
[127:05.72]My God, y'all didn't write a joke.
[127:08.31]Ronnie, on the spot.
[127:09.25]What?
[127:09.61]That's a big word.
[127:11.59]I wrote jokes, I just got- Ster had one good joke, I don't remember what it was.
[127:16.71]Alright, Ronnie, hold on.
[127:17.39]You're like the guy that goes to the comedy show and then goes, I can do better than that guy.
[127:21.83]That was bullshit.
[127:24.07]Yeah, I'm the drunk guy.
[127:26.29]Not funny.
[127:27.81]Put Ronnie on joke boat.
[127:28.97]Let's see how it goes.
[127:32.18]I want to see what this one is.
[127:33.18]I'm just trying to earn my keep.
[127:40.24]Alright, so we're just going to do four.
[127:42.24]Should the audience be disabled?
[127:45.92]just turn sorry no audience at all audience is fine the audience needs those votes but just don't keep it on alright uh here we go is it called role models now we're gonna ruin the game
[128:10.43]You must be the Guinea pigs I ordered.
[128:12.33]Sign in with the room code and make sure to snap a selfie or draw yourself for our records.
[128:18.71]Oh, we get to draw ourselves?
[128:20.45]Oh, you get to draw yourself, cool.
[128:21.77]Yeah, draw Vegeta again.
[128:22.81]I hope I can do that.
[128:25.49]Alright, go ahead and come in.
[128:42.10]You guys all in?
[128:44.06]Yeah.
[128:46.26]Okay.
[128:47.46]So, change name.
[128:48.58]What do you mean change name?
[128:49.76]No, that's fine.
[128:53.73]You guys drawing yourselves?
[128:55.73]Yep.
[128:56.77]I need better than that.
[128:57.99]Okay.
[128:58.39]Let me know when you guys are ready.
[129:16.28]Draw me, draw me.
[129:22.16]This is my favorite thing about this.
[129:23.92]So, the three artists.
[129:28.05]You know what I mean?
[129:28.81]They're like, I just drew like a dumb face and the three artists just bang, I can draw.
[129:32.51]Let's go.
[129:32.83]But wait, Stars, what the hell are you doing?
[129:35.42]Oh, these are faces?
[129:36.54]Oops.
[129:36.78]Oh, they're faces.
[129:38.66]I didn't know it was a face!
[129:39.82]Wait.
[129:39.98]We start over?
[129:40.60]Just draw yourself and it starts over.
[129:44.13]Yeah, do it again.
[129:45.27]Do it again?
[129:45.67]Okay, I got it.
[130:03.05]Oh, wait.
[130:03.67]Yeah, you don't have to draw the head.
[130:04.97]You don't have to draw a circle.
[130:06.39]It's already the face.
[130:07.31]Yeah, it's already there.
[130:08.07]I get what you mean.
[130:11.54]Alright, I'm clicking everybody's in in ten seconds.
[130:16.94]Okay.
[130:17.06]This is important.
[130:20.36]This is how people will see me.
[130:21.45]Did that go through?
[130:24.41]It did.
[130:25.01]Alright, your hands are- whatever.
[130:34.19]if you have any questions about our process you're not alone here at the lab we've spent years searching for the genetic magic that makes each and every human a truly unique individual
[130:45.62]But that was hard, so we found a shortcut.
[130:48.45]We theorize every friend group has some version of the smart one, the popular one, the troubled loner who I can change.
[130:56.31]You get the idea.
[130:57.49]And these roles make it a lot easier to figure people out with science.
[131:02.86]You guys are going to match your fellow test subjects to the roles that fit them best.
[131:08.62]My lovely assistant will put all the data into the tubes, and at the end, we'll crunch the numbers and tell each of you who you really are.
[131:15.06]Okay, I moved all the chemicals out of licking distance, so let's go.
[131:19.24]I need a category to get us started.
[131:22.76]Vote for your favorite, but try to make it something everybody knows a little bit about.
[131:26.27]Game of Thrones.
[131:27.33]Everyone knows a little bit about their deepest fears.
[131:29.73]Game of Thrones.
[131:30.57]Deepest fears, that's what I think.
[131:32.01]Oh, I might be able to, oh, I'm going to smoke you in Spice Girls, you freaking millennials.
[131:39.56]Ronnie, Ronnie, I'm 34.
[131:44.00]Which of these is secretly your deepest fear?
[131:47.96]So, on your device, you've got the names of your fellow lab rats.
[131:51.41]Drag each one to the role you think fits them best.
[131:53.83]Oh, and you'll see a little 99% sign next to each role.
[131:59.19]Tap that to lock in the answer.
[132:01.39]Your 99% certain will match what everyone else picks.
[132:04.22]I'll make it worth your while if you're right, so make sure to pick someone.
[132:07.80]When everyone's given out their roles, we'll check out the results.
[132:18.79]I think I got it.
[132:20.67]I think I got this mail.
[132:25.71]Why does it say hold up?
[132:29.33]Why wouldn't it?
[132:32.43]Let's see where we landed.
[132:37.12]Let's look at those votes.
[132:40.31]get rid of the outliers we have our winner is scared of snakes how do you win being scared of snakes so I'll give you guys these nutritious science pellets whenever your answers match the group whoever has the most at the end is my lab rat of the month plus they're a healthy snail
[133:07.10]Subjects who already have a role don't need another one.
[133:09.38]So, let's lose these votes.
[133:11.83]Ster knows me way too well.
[133:13.27]It was 2v2!
[133:14.75]Oh, we both know Ashley.
[133:27.66]Hey.
[133:29.90]I've given public speeches before.
[133:31.70]I was good.
[133:32.31]Fuck you, guys.
[133:33.49]Why would I be afraid of something that I know?
[133:37.21]I just saw the word clowns when I put you on this.
[133:39.19]Yeah, we all knew you would be a clown today.
[133:41.31]Well, I just got a super pellet.
[133:42.63]Thanks, guys.
[133:43.83]You're the clown streamer.
[133:44.87]Afraid of himself.
[133:47.45]There's our lineup.
[133:48.21]And here's how you're doing on science pellets.
[133:51.98]Just a reminder, I'll reward you with pellets when your answers match the group or when you do the best in a tiebreaker experiment.
[133:58.53]Keep that in mind if you want to be the lab rat of the month.
[134:07.52]What's our next category?
[134:12.52]Uh, next category.
[134:14.48]I don't know any- Oh, I hate these categories.
[134:16.26]I don't know anything about- I don't know anything about- Writing it's true.
[134:21.12]I got way too excited about clicking dwarves.
[134:24.14]I'm only doing this because I know them all.
[134:28.49]Me too.
[134:29.51]You know them all?
[134:30.85]Sleepy, Beepy.
[134:31.87]Josh!
[134:32.47]Shh!
[134:33.15]Don't give it away.
[134:34.21]Sleepy, Beepy, Deepy, Geepy.
[134:35.41]Which of the seven dwarves are you?
[134:38.47]Don't overthink this.
[134:40.31]And remember to tap the 99% button next to the comment you'll feel most strongly about.
[134:47.76]Ronnie Bashful.
[134:49.20]Oh, yeah.
[134:50.18]Okay, let's all follow Ashley's answers.
[134:53.26]Also, is Doc a role?
[134:58.62]What?
[134:59.16]You can either be grumpy or a doctor.
[135:02.51]No, he's just like the average, he's like the Super Mario of the dwarves.
[135:06.87]The Super Mario?
[135:08.71]Some would call him, potentially, like the ultimate dwarf.
[135:14.17]Yeah, you know like Super Mario is like very basic in Smash?
[135:17.25]Where did he even get his degree?
[135:19.01]Middle of the road.
[135:21.67]Oh, I forgot to see that.
[135:22.61]Let's see that data!
[135:23.33]Does that not seem so white?
[135:30.41]You really know yourself.
[135:32.05]Or at least what your friends think of you.
[135:34.13]Wait, yeah, we're not supposed to influence each other.
[135:36.08]We really just picked it.
[135:38.48]Yeah, Ashley ruined the whole experiment.
[135:40.52]Why'd you go with what I said?
[135:42.02]I didn't.
[135:42.82]You're grumpy.
[135:43.52]Seriously, I don't know why he picked himself as grumpy.
[135:46.58]Yeah, Ashley's grumpy.
[135:47.68]Look at her face.
[135:48.78]Sorry.
[135:49.20]You earned the role with the highly motivating audience bonus.
[135:52.18]I think our control group likes you.
[135:53.92]The edge.
[135:59.86]You ate your wife.
[136:00.66]Doc.
[136:00.92]I picked myself as Doc because I'm the smart doctor.
[136:05.21]You're too smart to follow naming conventions.
[136:07.03]Oh, sure.
[136:10.39]Oh, crap.
[136:10.83]What was the other one?
[136:14.33]Great!
[136:17.41]Well, I hope that makes sense.
[136:18.93]Alright, now don't talk about your answers.
[136:24.75]Fine.
[136:25.45]Because it's got to be real.
[136:27.19]Here is how it all shook out.
[136:29.21]And by the way, you?
[136:31.57]You are scary good at this.
[136:33.57]Do you want a job?
[136:34.41]Ooh, I'm scary.
[136:39.38]Okay, you've each got some roles under your belt.
[136:42.07]Let's see what the data tells us.
[136:44.75]I think the faces aren't looking the closest to the vision in general, did it?
[136:48.81]From a very specific point of view, anyway.
[136:50.71]We're gonna pit you against each other and see who wins!
[136:53.22]Even the game knows!
[136:54.68]You're turned 10 years old again for one day.
[136:57.60]What do you do?
[136:58.14]I want both of you to write an answer that fits the trait above your head.
[137:02.37]The others will decide who did the best.
[137:14.60]10 for a day.
[137:19.20]Oh, god, my answer is terrible.
[137:20.99]Here it is.
[137:21.53]Oh, shit.
[137:23.19]Go to your devices now.
[137:24.31]Super easy.
[137:27.69]These are both good, though, actually.
[137:29.49]And it totally tells our age.
[137:33.42]Well, it says whose answer matched their characteristics the best, not whose answer is the best.
[137:38.78]Yep.
[137:39.88]We both gave the same answer.
[137:41.24]I mean, but seriously, carefree, buy Bitcoin, worry, invest in Apple.
[137:44.96]This is pretty damn good.
[137:46.55]We're going with you.
[137:47.31]Bitcoin went out with 10.
[137:53.72]I would make my plan for my pick.
[137:55.20]Introvert, introvert.
[137:55.76]Hold up.
[137:56.06]Oh, that's easy.
[137:56.44]Uh...
[138:23.84]Yeah.
[138:24.84]What if we choose the same answer again?
[138:26.42]Probably will.
[138:28.40]Okay, there's the data.
[138:32.02]Apologize.
[138:38.34]I mean, these are... We were all thinking the same thing on that one.
[138:45.04]A comedian comes out normally and is like, so happy to be in New York.
[138:47.57]I'm so sorry I'm in New York.
[138:49.07]I'm so sorry I'm here.
[138:50.03]I really... I'll just go.
[138:51.65]I'll go.
[138:52.65]This will be our last category, so choose wisely.
[138:55.55]Oh, one of these is banned.
[139:00.57]I was about to make that joke.
[139:02.75]Pizza toppings!
[139:06.42]These are all... What is college... Alright, we're doing... Bonnie, just click pizza toppings.
[139:11.14]Pizza?
[139:11.58]Alright.
[139:12.90]These are all bad, so... Are we only going to get pizza toppings?
[139:16.32]Yes.
[139:17.58]We're only interested in pizza toppings.
[139:22.42]Which pizza topping fits each of you best?
[139:27.94]Okay, make those matches.
[139:29.29]I know what everybody's going to pick for me, but I'm going to pick something else for me.
[139:36.59]They're friends while they're eating pizza.
[139:52.82]Let's see what everyone picks!
[139:55.20]I pretend my pizza is my friend's.
[139:56.86]There's no, like, blood.
[140:00.93]I knew you were a green peppers guy.
[140:02.63]Oh, yeah, yeah, I love green peppers.
[140:04.03]How many times can Jerma talk about peppers and not be peppers guy?
[140:09.78]Just cheese.
[140:10.58]See, that was definitely Ashley to me, yeah, yeah.
[140:15.66]Just cheese.
[140:16.84]Mm-hmm.
[140:19.55]What?
[140:20.03]What?
[140:49.71]Are we supposed to be in the same room?
[140:51.49]Is that what they're assuming here?
[140:52.49]I don't have a shirt on.
[140:53.55]I can't do this.
[140:54.25]Hold on.
[140:54.85]I don't have a shirt on.
[140:56.85]No, don't turn on your camera.
[140:58.03]It's fine.
[140:59.81]Alright.
[141:00.25]Describe your dance.
[141:01.41]Yeah, describe it.
[141:02.79]Your dance?
[141:03.73]I crumple down into a ball and lie down in a semicircle and just kind of shake.
[141:11.21]That's a good dance, sir.
[141:15.28]Hold on 20 seconds.
[141:16.56]I can think.
[141:16.92]Jerma's beating you.
[141:20.22]Look at him shaking down there on the floor.
[141:21.62]I mean, I'm still going.
[141:23.78]He's going nuts.
[141:24.72]You're standing there.
[141:25.90]I point out every individual acne on my face and say I'm Pizza Face over and over again.
[141:33.30]That's part of the dance.
[141:34.62]It's like a face-pointing dance.
[141:37.09]That's you being like a self-deprecating, like, psycho.
[141:40.35]According to our disturbingly sentient algorithm, the role goes to you.
[141:44.53]What?
[141:44.77]A zit-pointing dance.
[141:47.23]Performing the best in this experiment is definitely worth a few science pellets.
[141:52.88]Just don't spoil your dinner.
[142:01.45]You only got one vote, but you're still the best person for this role.
[142:04.63]Science can be weird.
[142:05.75]What?
[142:07.85]Pineapple on these sucks.
[142:08.89]And our audience control group hid some extra science bullets behind this role for you.
[142:12.55]But you're the wackiest topping.
[142:14.17]You know, you're the pineapple on that pizza.
[142:17.84]You're the one some people like too much.
[142:19.48]Yeah, you don't belong and everyone hates you.
[142:21.30]Here's where we ended up.
[142:24.12]Punch, punch him, punch him, punch him.
[142:28.67]One last thing before we close the book on this experiment.
[142:31.25]Let's see if there are any more interesting patterns in those rolls.
[142:36.63]You, judging by your rolls, you're this, and you're also this.
[142:43.94]That makes no sense to our algorithms.
[142:45.70]We're going to find out which quality fits you better.
[142:50.14]What's the first thing you look for when shopping for a new car?
[142:53.06]Answer this prompt on your device.
[142:55.40]Then the other subjects will vote on your response.
[142:58.00]Make sure it has wheels.
[143:00.60]If it doesn't have wheels, you just walk away.
[143:05.69]How many clones can you fit?
[143:07.67]Money.
[143:07.95]How much money is in the wheels?
[143:12.16]Yeah.
[143:12.72]How much money could I fit in the wheels for all my cocaine dealing?
[143:15.86]Yeah.
[143:16.74]That's what we're working with.
[143:18.68]Vote on your devices now.
[143:26.42]Read the context, make sure no puke.
[143:31.06]Is that dependable or wild?
[143:33.09]That's both of them, again.
[143:34.51]Give it to me.
[143:39.01]I feel like wild card always trumps dependable because, you know, by its very nature, it's the wild card.
[143:44.65]It trumps everything.
[143:45.69]In science, we call that a shutout.
[143:56.50]Your roles tell me that you're polar opposites.
[143:59.54]At least in this one extremely specific way.
[144:02.31]We're not leaving until we find out which of you is better at being you.
[144:06.77]Hello has been retired.
[144:08.69]You are allowed to pick the new universal greeting.
[144:11.60]What is it?
[144:12.70]Type an answer on your device.
[144:14.00]Pineapple.
[144:16.98]Oh, God.
[144:19.89]Does my brain go to the worst possible thing it could ever be?
[144:22.57]Mine does too!
[144:23.51]I can't do this!
[144:24.68]Yeah.
[144:25.16]He's gonna censor me.
[144:26.04]Don't do it!
[144:27.30]The Slimey chat said, hold up.
[144:31.22]Hold up.
[144:41.08]Look at me!
[144:41.75]Look at me!
[144:45.37]Fart sound.
[144:46.45]Three seconds.
[144:48.05]Three seconds of silence followed by a slap to the face.
[144:53.69]There you have it.
[144:55.77]Whatever.
[144:57.04]That's called bowing and they do it in Japan.
[145:01.88]Or you bend over the opposite way.
[145:03.32]Yeah, it's just bowing.
[145:06.44]Stop bringing that up.
[145:07.68]Like genitals forward, head back.
[145:14.01]Who answer match their characteristics best?
[145:17.25]Serious.
[145:19.51]Oh.
[145:20.35]Mine's funny.
[145:21.15]Mine's very serious.
[145:22.35]That's dead serious.
[145:23.49]That's scary serious.
[145:24.47]You were not serious.
[145:26.29]You weren't.
[145:27.35]You ever have somebody scream in your face before?
[145:29.29]That's not funny.
[145:30.23]That's fucking serious.
[145:31.33]Steve does all the time.
[145:44.40]And my favorite little lab rat with the most total science pellets is... Once again, I am the largest.
[145:54.01]This one is a quiet mega introvert.
[145:55.71]Please don't call me a mega introvert.
[145:57.13]I don't need that on my personality.
[145:59.23]I don't need it to be an enhanced version of negativity.
[146:06.72]These are too accurate.
[146:13.66]Cautious garden grouch.
[146:15.43]I like that.
[146:17.37]Even the nostalgic on Ronnie, we're just talking about 80s shit.
[146:20.79]I am extremely nostalgic.
[146:23.11]And what was Ger- Wait, what is Jerma's thing again?
[146:24.71]Childlike- You muted, Jerma.
[146:28.42]I'm here.
[146:30.90]I'm here, can you hear me?
[146:31.88]Nostalgic quiet.
[146:33.92]Childlike pseudo killjoy?
[146:37.00]Killjoy.
[146:37.62]Extremely carefree coward.
[146:41.21]Cautious guarded grouch.
[146:42.77]That's definitely going on your eulogy.
[146:45.71]Somebody that deliberately spoils the enjoyment of others through resentment or overly sober behavior.
[146:50.96]Like a buzzkill.
[146:52.26]Remember when you censored us all, you killjoy?
[146:54.12]That was okay.
[146:57.96]I can see why it wouldn't work with randoms.
[147:04.48]Yeah, that would not work with randoms.
[147:06.76]Thanks, Chad.
[147:07.28]You gave us good advice for once.
[147:09.00]You did it.
[147:09.90]They said suedo.
[147:11.46]Suedo killjoy.
[147:12.22]It means could be, but sometimes, you know... Oh, we wear suede?
[147:17.10]Alright, uh... I... Have to go.
[147:25.05]Time for one more of these.
[147:25.85]We'll do this again.
[147:27.63]Do you guys want to do this again?
[147:29.35]This one's fun.
[147:32.17]Wouldn't it be the same answers?
[147:33.73]Oh, this one would be the same.
[147:36.16]Let's just make sure we pick different things, I guess, different categories.
[147:38.64]Well, uh, we can... Let's do the dictionary one again.
[147:42.84]Alright.
[147:43.20]Yeah, I didn't do that one last time, so that'd be good.
[147:45.56]Also, Ronnie's been talking a lot of shit about the boat.
[147:49.10]Yeah, boat... Boat is like hard mode.
[147:50.76]A boat might take too long, though.
[147:53.52]Yeah, okay.
[147:54.23]I really only have like another, uh, like 30 minutes or so.
[147:58.85]Like 25 minutes to 30 minutes.
[147:59.69]Okay.
[148:07.25]Chat equals chimps.
[148:10.23]Chimps?
[148:10.55]That's my favorite still.
[148:13.29]Alright, I gotta call on all of my portmanteau and pun experience for this one.
[148:18.61]Okay, this is good to go.
[148:20.17]And we can add four people for this one too.
[148:22.75]So this will be the last game.
[148:23.69]Let's go ahead.
[148:28.63]And I'm gonna put this... Well, not yet.
[148:32.03]Have you done previous Jackboxes?
[148:33.94]Yes.
[148:34.16]On stream?
[148:35.00]I've done them all.
[148:38.02]I have done them all.
[148:40.86]Some of them are really good, but some of them are... Oh, well, Ronnie, you are the leader.
[148:44.68]Yeah, you joined first, so now you control everything.
[148:47.92]Oh, sorry.
[148:48.46]You only have to press, like, one button when everyone joins.
[148:51.98]All you have to do is just... You have a censor button.
[148:55.12]If somebody writes something inappropriate, you can just remove it.
[149:02.74]That is a lot of pressure.
[149:03.80]I'm a boring mod.
[149:09.85]Alright guys, here it comes.
[149:13.49]Last game, sub Discord, here it comes in 10 seconds.
[149:17.11]Here it comes.
[149:18.09]These names look like they've never been shown before.
[149:31.58]Hello!
[149:32.34]Welcome to the Dictionarium.
[149:34.80]It's a word game, and don't ask me where I'm from.
[149:37.64]It's a very complicated story.
[149:39.47]Ooh, I see I am in very good company.
[149:43.61]In the Dictionarium, you will make up a dictionary entry for a totally fake word.
[149:48.37]There is no right answer, but the most popular one wins, so stay on your toes.
[149:53.37]Oh, and for anyone watching, join the audience.
[149:56.13]Just input the room code and play along.
[149:58.74]Let's get started.
[150:00.60]Room code, top right.
[150:01.88]Jackbox.TV, link to Twitch.
[150:03.60]I am giving you a new word.
[150:08.33]Now write out the definition that fits this word.
[150:10.77]Hold up.
[150:16.49]I heard this word singing in the sewer, and I said, come up, little word, and it did.
[150:32.50]Done.
[150:32.72]Done?
[150:32.90]Yeah, I'm done.
[151:09.70]Good luck Let's see what we got was gossipy horse in the herd typically used as a finish on pork
[151:23.94]When you want someone to hold up, but your mouth is full of M&Ms and Baileys.
[151:27.02]What?
[151:29.76]Successful cat call.
[151:31.56]What?
[151:31.82]Oh, what's that?
[151:33.56]Okay, the time has come to vote.
[151:36.61]Pick the definition that makes you feel good.
[151:38.61]Oh, I know that stirs because he immediately explained it.
[151:41.21]I gotta explain it.
[151:42.35]There's logic.
[151:44.47]And remember, you can award bonus points to the ones that stole your heart.
[151:48.61]M&Ms?
[152:03.63]Do you not know what M&M's are?
[152:05.01]Is that the hold up?
[152:06.11]No, I just, but why M&M's and Bailey's?
[152:09.19]What's an M&M?
[152:11.25]Why not like... Alright, sorry.
[152:15.43]Because he's nostalgic.
[152:16.67]And the winning definition to be recorded forever in the dictionary is... Because that's the definition.
[152:21.56]Oh no, he's winning.
[152:24.66]He's growing, he's winning.
[152:27.18]Now let's do it again for the other word.
[152:30.90]Sure you working, but in Ireland.
[152:34.09]A shirt dunked in coffee for the smell.
[152:36.17]What?
[152:37.44]A man that turns into a shirt when he sees a full moon.
[152:42.30]How do you take off your shirt?
[152:45.06]What?
[152:45.90]Wear a shirt.
[152:46.78]Here we go again.
[152:47.64]It's like a one-shirt, but different.
[152:49.74]Pick the definition that's so accurate it makes you ween.
[152:52.69]These are actually a lot.
[152:53.39]These are really good.
[153:01.11]How do you take off your shirt?
[153:05.58]it was sure someone still has not voted that person should vote for the smell oh wow and the official note take back definition for the word is destroyed it

[161:10.59]None of those were clicking for me.
[161:15.60]It's been a long stream.
[161:16.54]Ronnie came in fresh.
[161:17.56]It's kind of cheating.
[161:18.76]Yeah, Ronnie came in fresh.
[161:20.22]We've been draining threes.
[161:21.12]You came in and drained five threes.
[161:30.95]That's okay.

[162:03.16]It's you!
[162:03.62]It's me, I just hit escape.
[162:07.16]I had a good basketball analogy and then I just heard the nursery rhyme in both ears.
[162:12.46]Alright, I gotta go.

[162:50.03]It's Penny Arcade.
[162:51.33]Stop it.
[162:53.49]Censor him.
[162:53.95]Censor this guy.
[162:55.68]See how funny he was in the games?
[162:57.04]That's how funny he is in his comics.
[162:58.92]No.
[163:00.95]No.
[163:01.55]No, he was lucky.
[163:03.57]See me on the boat.

[163:32.35]Yeah, whatever.
[163:33.19]Oh, whatever.
[163:35.75]I think if you get the three censors, it's strike three.
[163:37.86]I don't have to plug your stream.
[163:40.72]I think it's censored.
[163:42.70]Plug my stream.
[163:44.06]Hey, twitch.tv slash... What is it, Ashley?
[163:46.40]Yeah.

[164:41.86]Is going to be... Hopefully a lot of fun.
[164:46.34]The secret slime stream.
[164:48.00]That's what's going to happen.
[164:49.22]We're going to do a bunch of activities.
[164:51.17]It is slime time.
[164:54.29]So I will see you guys in a few days.
[164:56.51]On the 31st.
[165:00.73]And we will do the bits.
[165:01.75]I still have time.
[165:02.35]That's why I need to go.
[165:03.61]I need to make sure there's still time for that.
[165:06.06]Which there is.
[165:12.02]Where was my, um, outro?
[165:15.64]Pay no attention to the bottom stuff.
[165:18.62]It's still fucking wrong.
[165:21.10]But that's alright.
[165:25.85]Take care.
[165:26.19]See you on Halloween.
[165:27.05]If you don't, uh, see the Halloween stream, maybe we'll see you again next time.
[165:33.50]We're gonna start either Outer Worlds or Dead Rising when I come back.
[165:38.22]And there's also gonna be another community content night.
[165:44.66]There's lots to do.
[165:48.10]Oh, by the way, this is... I wanted to give a link to... This is Ronnie's comic.
[165:54.01]Womp.
[165:54.79]That was Womp Ronnie.
[165:56.17]Womp comic.
[166:01.89]I did not link it, so I wanted to link it.
[166:04.31]Alright, let's do the bits.
[166:05.59]See you guys on Halloween.
[166:09.98]And here we go.
[166:14.49]earlier we had.

[166:19.68]It's time for slime!
[166:21.18]What a perfect... Perfect first bit donation here.
[166:28.69]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[166:29.57]Now that Obra Dinn is on Switch, you should play it during your upcoming travels.
[166:33.45]It's great and not very long, so you could definitely finish it during the trip.
[166:38.14]unpopular opinion you shouldn't play it on stream chat will absolutely spoil it for you every single step of the way it's such a wonderful game though I hope you enjoy it on your own time well I do have an upcoming very long plane ride so maybe yeah it's on the switch maybe I'll just get it just disable chat
[167:06.12]Actually, I do want to play it, but it was one of those things that just never ended up happening.
[167:12.38]It's a lot of games.
[167:13.06]Too many games.
[167:15.32]Hey, Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250 bits.
[167:18.98]And it is an image.
[167:23.32]It's me with my hands up, like with a scary face, like I'm going to strangle somebody.
[167:30.40]Okay, what the fuck is this?
[167:39.47]Uh... This is like, I'm gonna strangle you?
[167:52.92]Thanks for that.
[167:56.96]Appreciate it.
[167:57.42]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[167:59.50]Uh, thank you Gnarly for the 250.
[168:01.42]Hey Jerma, didn't have a dream last night.
[168:04.14]What the fuck?
[168:06.19]I'm sorry.
[168:06.87]I mean, actually, dreaming kind of sucks.
[168:08.33]I don't know if this happens to you guys, but after I have a vivid dream that I remember, I feel like shit the next day.
[168:15.08]And it travels with me all day.
[168:19.88]You just feel like crap.
[168:21.57]You wake up slower.
[168:23.57]You have a step lost.
[168:28.49]It's just one of those things.
[168:30.75]I feel dehydrated.
[168:33.00]Yeah, it's weird.
[168:35.56]Sometimes I wake up with a headache.
[168:38.30]Even if it's a very normal dream.
[168:41.98]It's very weird.
[168:43.42]But thank you, Gnarly, for the 250.
[168:48.17]Thank you to... Thank you, Emmanuel Depressed, for the 500 bits.
[168:52.37]Jerma.
[168:53.57]If you don't count streaming as an official job, Kim is dating a retired, balding substitute teacher.
[168:58.27]Okay.
[169:04.69]Okay.
[169:21.61]What subjects did you teach?
[169:22.93]I taught.
[169:25.58]I didn't teach anything.
[169:26.38]I did substitute teaching.
[169:27.82]So I filled in wherever it was available.
[169:35.52]That was a childlike killjoy.
[169:38.60]Yeah, you want to talk about killjoy?
[169:50.83]Did you entertain your class?
[169:53.03]Yeah, I told you one time I just started speaking.
[169:54.53]I was just talking with a British accent the whole day.
[169:56.29]And I think the principal of the school actually asked me, like, hey, are you doing that?
[170:00.07]And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess I am doing that.
[170:11.84]Do that now.
[170:12.40]I don't care.
[170:17.82]Is that why you can handle the chat?
[170:26.78]Thank you, Emmanuel Depress for the 500 bits.
[170:28.74]Appreciate it.
[170:30.32]Thank you, Klebman, for the 300 bits.
[170:32.62]Hey, Jeremiah, I just looked up your name on IMDb.
[170:35.40]Is it really true that you were in Neil Breen's Fateful Findings?
[170:39.06]That's the thing about IMDb.
[170:40.80]Anyone can edit that shit.
[170:45.20]No, I don't know what that is.
[170:57.41]I think editing IMDB is easier than editing Wikipedia.
[171:00.63]You know why?
[171:01.15]Because nobody gives a shit when you're on IMDB.
[171:06.53]People actively try to fix Wikipedia.
[171:09.25]Who's actively trying to fix IMDB?
[171:11.15]But anyways.
[171:18.23]Thank you.
[171:20.09]Appreciate it.
[171:20.67]300 bits.
[171:25.15]Thank you, Bone Jackal, for the 500 bits.
[171:26.81]I don't know what it is, but something about your streams just makes me so gassy.
[171:32.07]You guys ought to start calling me... I'm not going to read this name out loud, because I'll be heading to the super... I don't even know.
[171:39.30]The toilet.
[171:39.76]Whatever.
[171:40.06]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[171:47.03]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[171:48.09]Uh, you know actually that to get the best sleep, you're supposed to sleep in a cooler environment.
[171:52.09]That means turn down the heat during the winter.
[172:13.73]Sleeping at like 78 degrees is actually really not that good for you.
[172:20.70]That is real.
[172:21.34]Yeah.
[172:26.10]It's true.
[172:29.84]But pillow-wise... I prefer... I like squishy pillows.
[172:38.04]Because really like fluffy pillows you...
[172:41.51]you sink into them and they end up just turning into a little bunched up piece of crap whereas a squishy pillow holds its form and can read you can lie on it you can put it on your uh especially considering if you sleep on your side and you put your hand under your pillow a fluffy pillow you end up with a you know you get pins and needles in your hand and stuff no it's uh squishy for me
[173:07.97]Thank you for the 250.
[173:08.81]Awesome sauce.
[173:09.35]You gave that 10 community subs.
[173:10.77]Thank you earlier.
[173:14.16]Speaking of subs, let's see.
[173:18.32]Let the credits roll.
[173:20.37]Here it comes.
[173:23.89]I really hope you guys enjoy the Halloween stuff.
[173:25.37]This is kind of the continuation of what I was saying a couple months ago.
[173:30.63]Where every like one to two months, I really want a kind of a big stream.
[173:40.50]So hopefully that we can keep this going.
[173:43.80]And I hope you like it.
[173:47.58]We're going to try.
[173:51.17]Should be fun.
[173:55.75]Thank you, everybody, for subbing.
[173:58.51]As always.
[174:00.11]Hey, Doc, thanks for the 300 bits.

[174:11.92]Those memories are great.
[174:15.12]Those memories are great.
[174:18.80]I loved every second on YouTube.

[174:50.93]Can't believe it's been about a year since I found your stream.
[174:53.51]Here's to another year watching whatever you decide to do for us.
[174:57.04]Dream of heart.
[175:01.30]Happy birthday.
[175:03.76]Yesterday.
[175:04.94]Feels birthday, man, right?

[175:10.16]Yeah, happy belated birthday, right?
[175:14.65]And, yeah, I'm... Here's to another year.
[175:18.67]We'll see what happens over the ne- uh, some- some pre- It's- it's pa- the sum- over the next, like, six to twelve months... I'm gonna keep doing stuff like you'll see on Halloween and like you saw at the carnival and even after that.
[175:31.26]There's already, like, a bunch of things already going forward.
[175:36.30]So... I anticipate the next year to be the most... full of stuff.
[175:43.96]Like, from, like, September to next September.
[175:47.74]It's just gonna be full of stuff.
[175:49.28]Full of things.
[175:54.16]And we'll see how it goes.
[175:56.42]But thank you, our team, and happy birthday.
[175:59.50]And then finally, Vilemi right now.
[176:01.80]300 bits.
[176:02.42]Jerma, do you prefer squishy or fluffy tails?
[176:07.54]Um... What does that even mean?
[176:11.16]Squishy tail?
[176:16.35]What tail is squishy?
[176:19.59]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[176:21.49]It will be fluffy because it's like a... I just like... I like hamsters and stuff.
[176:30.33]This is a trap, Jeremy.
[176:33.90]Whatever.
[176:36.96]Don't answer this.
[176:38.10]It's fine.
[176:38.40]I don't know.
[176:38.70]Whatever.
[176:39.48]It's fine.
[176:39.90]Whatever.
[176:40.50]Whatever.
[176:40.82]I like animals.
[176:43.72]Alright?
[176:44.86]I love animals.
[176:47.77]Is it okay?
[176:51.75]That's it.
[176:53.78]And that is it!
[176:58.24]Thank you for watching.
[177:01.30]You'll see me again on Halloween.
[177:03.67]Just to go over again what's gonna be happening.
[177:06.35]Halloween is...
[177:09.05]There's going to be a secret slime stream that's going to be... Actually, I guess I could just tell you.
[177:15.83]So you can prepare for it.
[177:16.63]There's going to be... Trivia.
[177:20.31]You're going to have your own podium.
[177:23.63]It's not really a secret.
[177:24.47]You kind of need to know.
[177:30.49]Because I don't want to spend that much time explaining it.
[177:32.37]Because I'm going to be live and this is going to happen.
[177:35.55]We're doing a trivia night.
[177:39.12]Doing a couple other things.
[177:41.24]Slime.
[177:42.20]Secret Slime Actions.
[177:43.66]If you have no idea what's going on, go to the Secret Slime Discussion channel and the Actions channel and look at the description.
[177:52.23]There's about a two-paragraph description of what's going to be happening.
[177:54.47]It's going to be kind of like circa 1995 Nickelodeon.
[177:56.71]Should be fine.
[178:04.57]What time is it starting?
[178:06.05]It's probably starting around probably 4 p.m.
[178:09.10]Eastern.
[178:10.18]Between 4 and 5 p.m.
[178:11.84]Eastern.
[178:13.02]I'm going to lock that down.
[178:13.98]We just don't know yet.
[178:16.18]We will know very soon.
[178:17.63]It's not going to be like 2 Pacific.
[178:19.95]It'll be like around 4.
[178:20.53]4 or 5 Eastern.
[178:30.27]Bilgeberry is gonna have his own podcast.
[178:34.00]Nah, I don't know.
[178:34.64]Who knows?
[178:35.52]I don't know what the fuck his schedule is.
[178:37.20]It's hard.
[178:37.80]He's very busy.
[178:40.44]Hard to lock that guy down.
[178:42.30]4 p.m.
[178:48.44]Eastern is... is earlier than I start here.
[178:54.83]So that would be about a 1 p.m.
[178:58.07]Pacific start.
[178:59.07]I mean, I typically start between like 1.20, 1.30, 1.40.
[179:04.34]So that's earlier than I start now.
[179:08.32]Somewhat.
[179:09.04]It'll be sort of around that same time frame.
[179:13.08]Hey, Mr. Comcast, thanks for the 500 bits.
[179:17.52]Who's going to win the slime contest?
[179:18.94]I have no idea because there's a lot that can happen.
[179:24.13]Thank you, Mr. Comcast, for the 500 bits.
[179:25.13]Holy shit.
[179:41.57]I found it a few days ago that I'm going to have to have my leg amputated.
[179:45.31]So it's been a very scary time for me.
[179:46.77]I just wanted to let you know that you're one of the main reasons I've been able to cope.
[179:50.41]Thank you for bringing laughter when nothing else does and keeping me sane.
[179:52.85]I am so fucking sorry to hear that.
[179:58.41]But you've been coming in with funny shit for a long time.
[180:08.70]I'm really sorry to hear that that's happened to you.
[180:13.56]Hopefully, everything can go as planned.
[180:16.57]Hopefully... I'm so fucking sorry to hear that.
[180:28.11]But... You've been around for a long time.
[180:38.89]Like, look at this chat.
[180:40.13]This is just... Support each other, guys.
[180:45.96]Seriously.
[180:55.17]Much love to you.
[180:57.51]I hope everything turns out okay.
[181:03.84]I wish you an extraordinarily swift recovery.
[181:13.00]And thank you for being part of this community, and thank you for continuing to be part of this community.
[181:29.78]And I am going to take off, because I have to get ready.
[181:39.30]Take care, everybody.
[181:42.86]Have a happy Halloween.
[181:44.74]If you are not going to participate in the stream.
[181:52.81]What time am I going to do?
[181:53.69]What time will... What game will you play for the secret slime?
[181:56.51]Oh, that's... You'll see.
[182:05.29]He's going to miss his screening of The Departed.
[182:09.29]Yeah, don't you know?
[182:09.95]If I'm going like... If I'm going back to Boston...
[182:12.92]I've got to watch The Departed twice before I get there.
[182:15.98]Just so I can make sure I'm up on the references.
[182:19.36]They'll know.
[182:28.74]Alright, guys.
