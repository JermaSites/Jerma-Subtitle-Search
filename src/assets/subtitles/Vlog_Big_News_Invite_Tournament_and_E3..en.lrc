[00:11.71]one of these days I'm seriously gonna fall back and crack the back of my skull on my tile floor but hopefully today's not that day because today's a very important day this is a vlog as you can tell and I got a lot of important very important things to talk about the most important thing before I take a sip of my delicious iced coffee
[00:30.50]is this invite-only tournament that I get invited to play in.
[00:34.43]So it's me, MLC_St3alth, and Star.
[00:38.35]We are all going to be playing in a Shoot Mania Storm tournament, and if you don't know what that game is, don't worry, it's because the game is in pre-alpha right now, and nobody's even really seen it.
[00:47.87]There's a trailer, there is a trailer for it, the trailer's going to be in the description, as well as the twitch.tv site where you can watch the tournament.
[00:55.59]I think TotalBiscuit and a couple other really, really super famous guys are going to be casting this thing.
[01:01.37]So it's very, very nerve-wracking and very, very like, oh my god, at the same time.
[01:06.92]Because we're invited to play.
[01:08.92]And the winner of this tournament that happens today, I think it goes on until tomorrow as well, the winner of the tournament gets to go to E3.
[01:15.15]And...
[01:18.78]We need to win this tournament.
[01:20.36]Because I want to go to E3 so bad.
[01:22.50]And I've been looking for ways to go.
[01:23.70]I've been trying to find ways to go to E3.
[01:26.03]And this is really the only option I have right now.
[01:28.93]And me, Star, MLC, Stealth, we've all been practicing.
[01:31.62]We've all been getting ready for this tournament for the last couple of days.
[01:34.74]And...
[01:35.56]The game's fun.
[01:36.60]It's very entertaining, very fun to play, very fun to watch.
[01:39.62]And, of course, the link in the description.
[01:40.86]I think it's 5 p.m.
[01:43.03]Eastern Standard Time, USA, is when we are going to be playing in this tournament.
[01:47.69]So I would appreciate it.
[01:48.55]You don't have to.
[01:49.15]You don't have to come out and show your support.
[01:50.85]But if you want to, then hell yeah.
[01:53.36]Thanks for coming out to the stream.
[01:55.00]And speaking of streams...
[01:57.50]There is not going to be a stream this weekend, specifically because of this reason, because I'm in this tournament.
[02:03.30]And also, if we win this tournament, I'm not saying we will, but if we do, going to E3 is going to be like a four or five day ordeal.
[02:10.97]So video-wise, if we do end up winning, and we do end up going to E3,
[02:16.09]Then I will try to get some stuff schedule uploaded.
[02:18.56]I'm not going to think that far ahead at this point because these are all ands, ifs, or buts.
[02:22.62]We got to win first.
[02:23.96]But regardless of all that, there will be stuff on the channel next week.
[02:27.05]So don't worry.
[02:27.59]Don't think I'm going to take like a two and a half week vacation from this channel because I am absolutely not.
[02:32.89]And also, if we go, I will make sure to do some vlog-type stuff, because Shibby's going to be there, IncredibleOrb's going to be there, of course, Star, MLC_St3alth, and these are all guys that I've wanted to meet and go hang out with since, like, six or seven months ago.
[02:46.28]So it'll be really interesting to really meet these guys in person, and hopefully it all works out.
[02:51.53]And if not, then, you know, whatever.
[02:53.35]What can you do?
[02:54.23]I had fun regardless.
[02:55.31]That's how I like to think about it.
[02:57.12]So yeah, that is going to wrap up this vlog.
[02:59.42]And that's what I'm doing this weekend, guys.
[03:01.60]So if you want to come check it out, 5 p.m.
[03:04.08]Eastern Time today, June 1st and into June 2nd.
[03:08.39]So go check it out.
