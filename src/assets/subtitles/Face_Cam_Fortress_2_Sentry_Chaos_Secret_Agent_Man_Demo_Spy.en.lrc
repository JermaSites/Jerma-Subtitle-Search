[00:22.63]Playing as the Demoman on King of the Hill Badlands.

[00:28.57]Bad, bad, bad.
[00:30.99]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:31.99]Okay, okay.
[00:32.73]Don't freak out here.
[00:33.55]It's just a sentry.
[00:36.18]And it's gone.
[00:37.66]oh oh oh my god thank you my goodness that was what the hell is going on oh my god did is that I am speechless right now there was just three big centuries I think one up there one down and one to the right
[01:06.72]Holy crap, that jaw lag.
[01:10.32]Wow.
[01:10.74]Oh my god.
[01:13.66]Okay, good to know.
[01:15.24]Good to know.
[01:16.70]We're getting beat.
[01:19.64]Help me.
[01:21.31]Oh man, I'm gonna die.
[01:24.23]I'm just gonna burn out.
[01:25.11]This is gonna be a sad death.
[01:30.47]Where's the health?
[01:31.17]Oh, thank every single god that exists for this medic.
[01:40.93]Get that guy gone.
[01:43.15]Where is this sentry now?
[01:45.07]Is it still over here?
[01:52.01]It's right there.
[01:53.81]That thing's going away right now.
[01:55.91]See you later, sentry!
[01:58.51]Another one!
[01:59.75]You guys are relentless with the sentry guns.
[02:01.51]At least I got the point.
[02:05.53]Oh, by the way, everyone was telling me in the last couple videos, they said, Jerma, your room is an absolute mess.
[02:11.60]So, I do agree with you, so I'm going to clean it for you right now.
[02:21.32]This is a pair of scissors, we don't need those.
[02:23.01]This is a, uh, some kind of disk.
[02:28.48]Is this an expensive camera?
[02:30.86]Oh!
[02:32.08]You see, I just made somebody gasp.
[02:33.96]Somebody just went, yeah!
[02:36.62]Uh, okay, we just lost.
[02:37.32]You know what happens when you lose.
[02:40.69]You do it again, and you win this time.
[02:44.29]Should I stay Demoman?
[02:45.27]That's the real question.
[02:47.91]Hmm.
[02:54.07]Uh, how many Demoman?
[02:54.83]What do we have?
[02:56.11]I'm staying.
[02:56.67]We only have one.
[02:57.33]It's me.
[03:00.63]Oh, I'm gonna take that scent free out!
[03:04.30]Alright, let's actually win this time.
[03:08.94]Gotta get a victory under our belts.
[03:11.06]Come on, dudes.
[03:14.16]How did I miss you?
[03:15.88]You slippery bastard.
[03:18.35]Oh my... Get the hell over here!
[03:25.01]Somebody, you know what?
[03:25.71]Someone's getting crushed with this.
[03:27.89]I'm going to crush someone.
[03:30.48]I'm mad right now.
[03:32.00]I'm mad.
[03:33.38]Bro.
[03:34.87]Wow, this is... I can't believe I'm actually still standing here.
[03:38.09]Not this time!
[03:38.77]Alright, we still got the point.
[03:42.33]At least we got the point.
[03:45.85]Oh, this engineer.
[03:47.24]No, let me kill him.
[03:48.92]I need to get the kill!
[03:49.94]No!
[03:50.60]God, okay.
[03:54.66]Oh, welcome to Facecam Fortress 2, where Jerma runs around in circles with the... Okay, there we go.
[03:58.58]Good, good, good.
[04:00.25]Good.
[04:02.29]Get that kill.
[04:05.35]That engineer is not going to build anything in that room.
[04:09.00]Not while I'm on my watch.
[04:11.28]I try to say not on my watch, and I say not while I'm on my watch.
[04:15.38]Not exactly sure what those words would mean together.
[04:19.33]That was actually like a literal phrase.
[04:21.27]Not while I'm on my watch.
[04:24.07]Oh, you bastard.
[04:30.01]Finally, I landed a shot on somebody.
[04:34.29]Oh, ready?
[04:37.32]Get out of here.
[04:39.06]Let's get a long-range shot right there.
[04:41.30]That would have been sick.
[04:42.24]Too bad I didn't get it.
[04:47.30]Oh!
[04:47.84]Oh, baby!
[04:49.57]Come on, somebody stumble out of there.
[04:54.21]Somebody stumble on out of there.
[04:56.73]Nope.
[05:01.41]Oh, that's how you smash.
[05:06.32]Like, I turned the corner and just got absolutely decimated.
[05:13.56]Oh, that's one way to lose.
[05:16.18]Anything up here?
[05:17.72]No.
[05:18.58]Spy, though.
[05:21.45]Perfect opportunity right here for one of these.
[05:24.77]Oh, never mind.
[05:28.41]Everything in that room is going down right now.
[05:30.97]I'm just going to lob stickies into that window and just abso-freaking-lutely kill everything.
[05:37.58]You ready?
[05:38.30]Are you ready for this?
[05:38.84]I hope you're ready for this.
[05:42.98]Aww, that medic is a brave soul.
[05:46.72]What a brave bastard.
[05:48.80]Swinging away with his bone saw.
[05:50.84]In a room full of people and a sentry.
[05:53.16]I commend you, good sir.
[05:54.93]But you, on the other hand, whatever.
[05:56.57]You know what?
[05:56.99]He can keep his pride.
[05:59.61]It's time to destroy everything in that room.
[06:05.05]Oh, I got one guy.
[06:05.99]Oh, come on.
[06:09.67]Get in that room.
[06:10.45]Get in that room!
[06:12.05]Oh, there it is.
[06:12.89]Sentry down.
[06:14.43]And a big heavy up.
[06:16.58]Big heavy dead.
[06:17.10]Anything else in this room that I should be aware of?
[06:21.37]Yes, there is.
[06:24.09]Anything else I should be aware of here?
[06:25.67]Look at all this garden.
[06:27.97]Wonder what happened in there.
[06:31.99]Keep them closed off.
[06:32.81]Keep them closed off.
[06:36.72]Yeah!
[06:37.38]I think that's gonna be it.
[06:40.66]Cool, top frag.
[06:42.60]13 points as a Demoman.
[06:44.22]Boink.
[06:45.08]Alright, I promise I'm not going to kill you.
[06:46.64]I promise.
[06:48.55]Oh, you walked away from one taunt kill into another one.
[06:51.19]But I didn't get it.
[06:51.81]Alright, we'll do one more life and then I'm going to close it up.
[06:58.36]One more life as a spy.
[07:01.12]And what we're going to do here...
[07:03.11]is actually very, very important.
[07:04.87]Alright?
[07:05.57]I'm gonna try to not kill anybody.
[07:08.55]I just want to blend in.
[07:10.67]I just want to be on blue team.
[07:12.58]That's all I want.
[07:13.34]But first, I want to kill this medic.
[07:14.62]Okay, now I want to just blend in.
[07:16.64]Alright, here we go.
[07:18.64]Ready?
[07:19.94]Not gonna try not to kill anybody.
[07:22.36]Just want to, like, pretend that I'm on blue team.
[07:25.72]Alright, guys, we gotta get on that point.
[07:28.85]Alright, yeah, we got it.
[07:30.37]Sweet deal.
[07:31.19]Awesome, dudes.
[07:33.30]Alright, we gotta cap this.
[07:34.08]Come on, guys.
[07:35.78]Cap it.
[07:37.40]Alright, nice job, you guys.
[07:38.44]We did a good job here.
[07:40.07]I commend both you guys.
[07:41.87]Gotta get that sentry up, man.
[07:42.99]I don't want to get, like, backstabbed by any spies, because I'm a sniper, you know.
[07:46.69]Oh, I gotta, like, snipe.
[07:49.87]Get that stuff up.
[07:51.58]Hold on, let me zoom in here.
[07:52.57]Gotta be careful.
[07:54.33]All kinds of things can happen right now.
[07:56.77]You know, this guy... If... If I... You know what?
[08:02.53]I'll see you guys all next time.
[08:04.00]Of course.
[08:04.62]And... Oh, no!
[08:18.06]Oh, well, I was gonna end it by... That was funny.
[08:23.30]But you know what, I guess I'll end it from right this.
[08:25.96]From right this, yeah.
[08:27.33]One, and two, and three.
[08:33.71]Come on, who wants to kill me?
[08:35.15]Somebody kill me.
[08:37.19]Somebody please kill me.
[08:42.32]Oh my god.
[08:46.70]You got me.
[08:48.38]Alright, guys.
[08:49.76]That's going to be it.
[08:50.68]I will see you guys all next time.
[08:51.90]And of course, take care, everybody.
[08:54.83]Time to clean my room.
[08:56.57]Let's go.
