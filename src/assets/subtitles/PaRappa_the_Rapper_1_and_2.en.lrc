[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.27]Good afternoon.
[00:03.11]How's everybody doing?
[00:05.08]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:07.26]To another live stream.
[00:10.14]Right from my house.
[00:12.22]In my room.
[00:14.60]Welcome.
[00:19.30]Today... We are going to play... Fake.
[00:25.64]Instant fake stream.
[00:35.26]Now, today we're gonna do, uh, the Parappa games.
[00:37.92]I said when I came back, after the few days there, that I was gonna do, uh, the thing.
[00:44.72]We're gonna finish the thing.
[00:46.82]I just got too far into that.
[00:48.07]It was like nine and a half hours.
[00:50.71]There's probably only like 45 minutes to an hour left in the thing.
[00:55.87]So I figured instead of starting with that, we're gonna end with that.
[01:00.07]Because those of you that want to watch the end of the thing, you'll, I mean, you might be here right now going, oh yeah, I want to see the end of the thing.
[01:08.23]So I'd rather put that at the end of the stream.
[01:11.69]So the beginning of the stream, we're going to do the Parappa games.
[01:15.88]Parappa the Rapper 1, Parappa the Rapper 2.
[01:18.74]Back to back, they're like an hour and a half each.
[01:20.84]They're like Um Jamma Lammy.
[01:22.60]So it shouldn't take us too long.
[01:30.07]Yeah, I rolled those off pretty well.
[01:32.81]Don't do the Wii game.
[01:35.53]I'm on the PlayStation 4.
[01:38.66]There's a Parappa the Rapper remastered, and then Parappa the Rapper 2 is just on PS4.
[01:44.22]On PSN.
[01:49.67]So this is not the... They made a Wii version of this game?
[01:56.25]Parappa on the Wii?
[02:01.06]I don't remember that being a thing.
[02:03.06]Isn't this a Sony?
[02:03.90]This is a Sony franchise.
[02:07.34]The Wii?
[02:19.82]Only in the US?
[02:20.66]Why?
[02:22.25]Oh, one guy said that.
[02:23.27]Alright, well, whatever.
[02:24.45]Alright, give me one second.
[02:26.33]While I just make sure this is plugged in correctly, we're going to have to do a sync test so people don't think I have no rhythm.
[02:34.18]Because here's I got to make this clear, really clear.
[02:38.36]When you're watching me play a rhythm game, it might not be exactly sync correctly because it takes 600 plus milliseconds.
[02:46.31]For me to travel to you through the capture card.
[02:49.30]So.
[02:50.70]Sometimes it's a little bit, it's a little off.
[02:52.96]But if I press triangle, when it's like triangles on the screen, it might be like a centimeter off.
[02:57.38]And people go, wow, he's fucking terrible.
[02:59.08]He has no idea what he's doing.
[02:59.98]He has no rhythm.
[03:02.00]No, it's the interface.
[03:03.85]I'm going through an interface.
[03:09.11]Remember that.
[03:10.43]The next time I fuck up a level, it's because of the interface I'm on.
[03:15.59]Not me.
[03:18.82]He's already making excuses.
[03:20.04]No, I'm making excuses for you.
[03:24.00]No, I'm not.
[03:24.68]No.
[03:24.96]No excuses.
[03:25.60]Let's go.
[03:25.96]Wrapper the Wrapper.
[03:27.24]Remastered.
[03:28.69]I'm on the right.
[03:30.51]Yeah, that's correct, right?
[03:31.51]Wrapper the Wrapper?
[03:33.19]Let's go.
[03:40.49]Lying through his teeth.
[03:42.31]This is a classic video game.
[03:43.99]It's an old one for PlayStation 1.
[03:45.61]I don't know what to remaster.
[03:46.65]How do you remaster this game?
[03:49.37]What is there to remaster?
[03:52.41]It's just songs and button presses.
[03:54.89]Is it just updated graphics?
[04:01.95]Is it the music?
[04:02.61]Like the music's at CD quality, not... Is it DVD quality?
[04:15.99]Oh, I remember this.
[04:16.59]This is freaking me out.
[04:17.79]I played this when I was like 15.
[04:20.51]Alright, I'll shut up.
[04:30.79]This game is so 2000s
[04:53.81]Jet baby was really awesome.
[04:56.11]Oh, yeah, he can probably beat Superman.
[04:58.83]No, no, it's impossible.
[05:00.48]Sorry He sure is my hero And I'll take a giant spicy fries giant vanilla and cherry pie a Junior chunky burger curly fries and a large chocolate, please.
[05:16.81]Oh
[05:19.63]I'll have a chunky garden salad, ginger soda, and a lemon pie.
[05:22.88]What are you gonna have for apple?
[05:25.72]Here I am, with the girl of my dreams.
[05:27.98]Sunny, funny.
[05:29.28]Boy, she sure is beautiful today.
[05:32.41]Next, please.
[05:34.45]Water.
[05:35.21]Here it is.
[05:35.63]Oh, yeah, he just gets a water.
[05:44.78]Ooh.
[05:49.44]Well, I'm gonna say it.
[05:50.00]I'm gonna say it with them.
[05:52.20]You gotta do what?
[05:53.40]Gotta believe!
[05:56.44]Is it synced up?
[05:57.60]That was my test.
[06:05.33]Yeah.
[06:08.05]Is it good?
[06:08.67]Perfect, alright.
[06:09.17]Let me just make sure I don't look.
[06:10.62]One, two.
[06:11.82]One, two, three.
[06:13.06]One, two.
[06:14.34]One, two, three.
[06:15.74]Should be good, right?
[06:18.72]What's in the menu?
[06:19.34]I forget.
[06:22.54]Practice?
[06:23.06]No, we don't need to do any of this.
[06:26.33]There's no excuses for messing up now?
[06:28.17]Well, I mean, it's a rhythm game, so it's... I mean, this one's... I remember this one's not that hard.
[06:36.79]It was still a fun game.
[06:39.28]But it was very basic.
[06:41.92]At least in the first level or two.
[06:44.30]Does this get hard?
[06:48.14]Am I just remembering like 15 year old gamer god me?
[06:54.37]Something you guys have to realize.
[06:55.27]Everybody that's in their 30s right now was a fucking gamer god.
[06:58.71]Back when they were like 15, 16 years old.
[07:12.96]I used to drink an entire case of Code Red Mountain Dew and top-frag every Team Fortress Classic server I went into ever.
[07:20.90]There's no need to fear.
[07:36.09]Because Joe Chin is here.
[07:38.11]I forgot about Joe Chin.
[07:41.15]I have traveled the seven seas.
[07:42.82]I have crossed every mountain known to man.
[07:44.96]And I know that the mighty powers that I have are enough for jerks like you.
[07:48.42]I shall put on my magic gloves of glory and shall take you on a cruise to destroy all of you.
[07:54.61]Now, let me tell you this one incident at this coffee shop where there were four jerks instead of two.
[07:58.81]Oh, here we go again.
[08:00.33]Let's go.
[08:00.85]Bye now.
[08:01.15]Bye.
[08:02.94]Oh, he's so annoying.
[08:05.06]I need to become a hero too.
[08:14.05]How could I possibly do that?
[08:17.39]Here comes the classic song.
[08:27.40]Welcome to the fruits dojo.
[08:31.32]I trust that you are here to redeem yourself and to acquire skills that are necessary for your goals.
[08:38.51]Are you ready, young one?
[08:41.26]I shall give you my best.
[08:44.66]Let's see if you can challenge my wrath.
[08:56.16]Kick, punch, you all remember.
[08:58.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[08:59.26]Alright, this is a remaster.
[09:00.24]This looks good.
[09:01.33]Let's do it!
[09:03.09]Kick, kick, kick, kick, punch!
[09:17.68]oh oh
[09:46.28]Almost bad.
[10:00.15]It sounds off.
[10:00.93]Jump jump.
[10:26.92]You gotta get, you gotta change it up.
[10:29.98]You wanna see what it means?
[10:32.90]Why's the mouth not moving?
[10:35.00]Why's the mouth not moving?
[10:50.39]Nailed it!
[11:20.39]Good job, Parappa.
[11:21.79]You can go on to the next stage now.
[11:23.79]Yahoo!
[11:24.81]Alright!
[11:26.41]That was pretty good Yahoo.
[11:28.57]That was an awesome Toad Yahoo.
[11:35.05]Now.
[11:36.23]The end of my simple introduction.
[11:38.95]Put up your fists, you evil crusaders.
[11:41.61]Let me knock you out.
[11:43.32]Is this fan-made?
[11:44.40]No, this is re-release.
[11:46.34]You can get this on the PS4 store right now.
[11:53.56]Please save your play data.
[11:57.96]Sure.
[12:01.38]Next!
[12:04.36]I would like to keep playing the game, yes.
[12:05.86]I don't need to take a break.
[12:07.55]I think six minutes.
[12:09.65]You guys thought the Wii was bad.
[12:11.95]PlayStation 1 wanted you to take a break every, like, four and a half minutes.
[12:18.83]It's been twelve hours.
[12:23.17]It's a great day today.
[12:24.80]So what do you guys want to do?
[12:26.67]Let's go down to the beach.
[12:29.23]Okay, sounds cool.
[12:31.39]Don't we need a car to get anywhere?
[12:33.30]Oh, the driving one.
[12:35.00]I remember this one.
[12:36.94]Step on the gas.
[12:37.90]Step on the brake.
[12:40.02]I remember this.
[12:41.00]Whoa, check that out.
[12:43.04]That's the new Super Stretch Limo 900.
[12:44.86]Yeah, the maximum speed is tuned up to 463,200 miles.
[12:49.09]And final passenger seats, too.
[12:57.74]Is this Chad Chin, whatever his name is?
[13:00.10]Yeah.
[13:02.67]Hi.
[13:05.67]How do you like my new car, guys?
[13:08.05]Man, it's fat.
[13:09.99]The color is awesome, too.
[13:12.29]Not only that, it's a convertible.
[13:14.77]And it is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound.
[13:18.09]Would you girls like to go to the beach with me?
[13:21.61]Sure.
[13:22.45]Only if all of us can go.
[13:24.27]Of course, of course.
[13:26.13]Come on, girls.
[13:26.90]Sit up top with me.
[13:28.84]You guys can sit in the back.
[13:34.60]Everybody, hold on!
[13:35.90]That's huge.
[13:41.35]Hey, you just- you just, like, fucking ran over somebody.
[13:44.79]That's nice.
[13:45.97]I forgot- I forgot how much of a dick this guy was.
[13:47.91]Yeah, what you guys don't know is when- Cut to, like, later on tonight when he's sitting in his bedroom with his laptop looking at his credit card statement.
[13:55.28]And he's just fucking sitting there crying.
[13:56.76]He's just like, I just- Shit, I-
[14:04.77]There's a flower like me?!
[14:05.77]412,000!
[14:05.83]Oh, okay.
[14:06.49]I gotta relax.
[14:07.23]This is it.
[14:08.43]I love this song.
[14:28.21]You wanna learn how to drive, huh?
[14:30.99]It's harder than you think it is.
[14:32.63]It is.
[14:33.21]If you think you can handle it, try this rap.
[14:37.33]Do you think you know how to drive?
[14:38.73]Rap to me.
[14:40.69]Here's your license.
[14:42.17]You don't even know how to fucking use your turn signal.
[14:45.51]Let's do it.
[14:46.73]Alright, we're here, just sitting in the car.
[14:49.05]I want you to show me if you can get far.
[14:51.31]Step on the gas.
[14:53.64]Step on the gas?
[14:56.55]I don't want to sound this robotic.
[15:02.63]Step on the gas.
[15:04.09]Step on the gas.
[15:06.23]I always had trouble with this.
[15:10.47]Step on the gas.
[15:11.61]Step on the brakes.
[15:14.93]Step on the gas.
[15:15.93]I'm glad you know which way to go.
[15:20.27]But it ain't gonna stop me, here we go.
[15:22.81]Check and turn the signal to the right.
[15:25.03]Check and turn the signal to the right.
[15:27.01]Now turn to the right.
[15:28.20]Now turn to the right.
[15:29.64]Oh fuck.
[15:31.22]Oops.
[15:32.67]Now turn to the left.
[15:34.05]Check and turn the signals to the left.
[15:35.99]Now turn to the left.
[15:37.57]Now turn to the left.
[15:40.19]Whoa, ho, ho, ho.
[15:41.60]Stop the car.
[15:42.86]We got an emergency, can't you see?
[15:45.52]Do you know why we stopped the car?
[15:47.72]Do I know why we stopped the car?
[15:49.66]Yes.
[15:50.12]Yes.
[15:50.82]What?
[15:51.41]What?
[15:52.23]Do you know why we stopped the car?
[15:54.43]Do I know why we stopped the car?
[15:56.47]Yes.
[15:56.99]Yes.
[15:57.57]What?
[15:58.17]What?
[15:58.91]I forgot to close the door.
[16:00.91]You forgot to close the door.
[16:03.73]That was not bad.
[16:04.48]That was perfect sentence.
[16:06.00]That was a perfect sentence.
[16:11.00]What?
[16:11.16]Here it is.
[16:12.14]Yeah!
[16:43.63]That's why this game is so difficult actually now that I think about it because If you it's like triangle triangle triangle triangle L, right?
[16:51.92]That's easy triangle triangle triangle triangle L but the way that he talks Do I know what we stop the target?
[16:58.28]It's just it's not doesn't add up for my brain.
[17:00.78]I
[17:13.30]So I end up like, I second guess like where the sentence is.
[17:22.54]Is the audio misplaced?
[17:23.64]No.
[17:23.74]Maybe it is.
[17:30.39]Shouldn't be.
[17:32.45]Parappa!
[17:35.21]Hey Parappa!
[17:36.61]Where are you going with my car?
[17:38.23]You've only had that license ten minutes!
[17:43.79]That shit's fucking illegal, by the way.
[17:47.13]Everybody knows that you get your permit first, and then you can't drive.
[17:51.81]You have to have somebody that has a license in the car.
[17:55.33]Somebody has to be, like, a licensed driver in the front seat.
[18:01.07]What if you're over 18?
[18:02.64]You think Parappa the Rapper is over 18?
[18:07.44]I thought he was, like, 14.
[18:12.51]He's not like 12?
[18:13.89]He's 32?
[18:14.01]Dog years.
[18:14.51]He's not even... this is...
[18:47.74]I think with the eyes closed.
[18:48.60]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[18:54.13]I can understand SpongeBob being dirty.
[19:04.43]SpongeBob has like a weird old person hobby.
[19:06.74]He goes jellyfishing.
[19:07.76]That's an old person.
[19:17.56]Oh, no.
[19:19.36]I can't believe it.
[19:21.52]My dad's gonna bite me.
[19:24.02]Oh, grandpa.
[19:25.39]I still have 59 more monthly installments to pay.
[19:28.21]What am I gonna tell your mother?
[19:29.69]I hope you're ready to pay for everything.
[19:32.29]I'm in trouble now.
[19:34.49]How am I gonna pay for this car?
[19:36.83]How can I do that?
[19:41.34]Yeah, I know.
[19:42.60]I gotta believe.
[19:48.39]So you want to sell goods at this flea market, eh?

[24:27.93]Is that $437 per kick?
[24:29.65]Frappa, you don't have this money.
[24:30.73]You've got... I'm supposed to be... getting money for the car.
[24:49.02]Hiya, Parappa!
[24:50.20]Tomorrow's the big day, isn't it?
[24:54.03]You wanna see the cake that I got for Sunny?

[25:05.65]Wow.
[25:05.89]And then he turns to walk away.
[25:07.40]And there's like a... There's like a scar where his kidney was.
[25:11.56]Being beautiful as she is, Sunny deserves all the likes of the word beauty.
[25:14.86]The 40th floor represents the obstacles that we must face.
[25:16.74]The 40th floor represents the obstacles that we must face.
[25:18.30]And the 41st floor is just to keep that awesome relationship.
[25:21.18]The 42nd floor represents all the sights and sounds that Sunny and I will be experiencing in our glorious future.
[25:28.15]Well...
[25:29.32]Enough for now.
[25:30.26]I shall explain everything in better detail tomorrow.
[25:33.77]See ya.
[25:34.57]You've known her for a day.
[25:45.35]Parappa!
[25:46.43]What do you expect to do without a cake?
[25:49.27]A birthday party without a cake is like a dance floor without me.
[25:52.53]Do you understand that?
[25:56.87]I gotta go on a game show.
[26:17.12]Cheek, cheek.
[26:17.46]Oh, there's a... You gotta twi.

[33:35.25]Raph is losing his fucking mind.

[40:07.36]You can't wrap against the toilet.
[40:28.25]Alright, we're at the end.
[40:30.07]But I want to try to get cool on some of these songs.
[40:31.79]I don't just want to blow through this.
[40:33.40]Because then I can freestyle.
[40:40.82]I'm gonna try the Burgah Boy technique, by the way.
[40:42.94]I remember when me and Burgah Boy were younger.
[40:44.40]We played this game.
[40:46.75]And I'm gonna show you what he did.
[40:48.75]I was trying to play the game at this level.
[40:52.09]And I remember not doing so well.
[40:53.65]And I gave him the controller.
[40:55.71]And I'm gonna show you what he did, and he got cool instantly.
[41:00.12]I will show you.
[41:02.52]But you can't get cool the first time through.
[41:12.90]How long have I known Burgah Boy?
[41:16.03]Uh, like 30 years.
[41:17.25]Mm-hmm.

[45:12.11]Waking up was the name of the game.
[45:14.35]For me, you, you, you, and you.
[45:16.61]For me, it's his name.
[45:17.65]He grew up in this town.

[47:33.47]I win.
[47:38.25]The game is 30 minutes.
[47:39.79]Well, now I have to get cool on some of these levels.
[47:43.23]I'm gonna try the Burgah Boy technique.
[47:50.27]Again, again.

[47:56.87]And then Rap of the, Rap of the Rap 2 is right after this.
[47:59.21]And that's the stream, no.
[47:59.83]It's not the stream.
[48:22.42]Why did they walk into a movie that was already finished?
[48:25.47]They were really late.
[48:28.75]And they bought the tickets online, like three days ago.
[48:32.17]PSP?
[48:32.71]Wait, hold on a minute.
[48:43.84]Is this the PSP version that they just blew up for the PS4?
[48:47.70]Wait a second.
[49:00.85]Weren't... Weren't these guys trying to make another game?
[49:04.45]They were gonna do a Kickstarter and it didn't work out, right?
[49:11.00]Yeah.
[49:11.20]It was gonna be like a, like, Project Rabbit?
[49:16.10]Why not?
[49:16.56]That brings... Yes, yeah, that's the one.
[49:21.49]But they didn't make enough money?
[49:24.61]They got 8% of what they needed.
[49:26.47]Well, that's really, really, really low.
[49:33.54]Mighty No.
[49:34.23]9 killed most of these Kickstarter games.
[49:37.99]What, what, Mighty No.
[49:38.75]9 got, like, how much did it get, like, eight million dollars?
[49:44.71]How much money did Mighty No.
[49:45.64]9 get?
[49:53.44]Too much.
[49:54.48]Too much.
[49:56.64]It was almost four million dollars.
[49:59.51]Holy shit.
[50:07.07]Alright.
[50:08.77]It's time to do... We're going to play the levels again.
[50:11.61]Or not all of them, but maybe some of them.
[50:13.85]I want to try to get cool on... I want to do the Burgah Boy technique.
[50:18.83]What?
[50:25.37]What are you talking about?

[50:50.62]I'm gonna do everything verbatim exactly.
[50:52.94]I remember it like it was yesterday.
[51:09.33]The secret trick, the secret word.
[51:17.22]This is not me making a joke, by the way.
[51:18.96]This is really what happened.
[51:33.80]Let's see if it works.
[51:41.16]Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
[51:54.62]Almost sparked.
[51:55.26]You gotta do the right thing.
[51:57.24]I gotta believe. I gotta believe. I gotta believe.
[52:21.97]But I do it like, because I like, no one sippin' inside, no one, but I do it like that, because I like, no one sippin' inside, no one.
[52:26.53]You gotta do what?

[54:37.13]I should have done that at the beginning.
[54:38.13]You, you, you you you you you.

[54:52.84]I gotta pee?
[54:54.26]I gotta pee!
[54:54.80]Alright, let's try another one.
[55:00.52]Everybody, don't- you have to remember: the Burgah Boy technique... works sometimes.
[55:16.52]A broken clock is right twice a day.
[55:18.52]I know... but that's still- the clock is still correct sometimes when you- you know what I mean? It's still correct.
[55:30.87]Alright, what's one of them I want to do?
[55:33.17]Let's do the cooking one.
[55:33.97]I'm just going to destroy this one.
[55:35.79]We're going to bird boy technique this one.
[55:39.01]But it's only correct for a minute.
[55:40.57]And that was probably a minute long.
[55:42.31]That's how long that needed to be right.
[55:44.71]Every single day, stress comes in every way.
[55:57.34]I ain't got no time for nobody.
[56:00.82]Alright, let's blow this out of the water here.
[56:02.66]Oh, I did it twice in a lot of crap seconds.
[56:29.24]Butter joins the bowl.
[56:30.96]Butter, butter, butter, butter joins the bowl.
[56:32.86]Butter.
[56:33.20]You're making us a cake that you've never seen before.
[56:35.67]You're making us a cake that you've never seen before.

[82:21.41]Crack, crack, crack, the egg into the bowl.
[82:23.59]Crack, crack, crack, the egg into the bowl.
[82:25.33]M-I-X, the flower into the bowl.
[82:27.25]M-I-X, the flower into the bowl.
[82:29.27]Oh my god, it's so offbeat when you do it the wrong, right way.
[82:32.51]The music sucks too!
[82:52.64]It's the- the song sucks.
[82:54.48]It's so distracting.
[82:56.72]Just fail.
[82:57.52]Fuck that song.
[83:21.38]What is feel the beat?
[83:24.43]See the beat.
[83:27.37]Huh?
[83:27.49]You're telling me I could have done a 16x9?
[83:29.87]Oh, no.
[83:30.35]It's already on 16x9.
[83:31.03]Alright, let's do Parappa the Rapper 2.
[83:38.13]The fucking chicken level just tilted me to a point where I wanted to do the other one.
[83:45.58]Big Bitch just came in right now.
[83:46.60]Hold on.
[83:48.04]Hold on just one second.
[83:48.90]Let me just change the game.
[83:53.65]To Parappa the Rapper 2!
[83:57.07]Click the touchpad to use the selected... Oh, it's because this is not a remaster.
[84:01.83]Right.
[84:02.63]This is just a full-on... They just ported it.
[84:08.37]I think.
[84:10.47]But somebody just gave... That was Ishanji for the 5,000 bits.
[84:18.90]50 bucks from Asanji.
[84:19.62]Thank you so much.
[84:21.22]They say, cool on Cheep Cheep level or Riot.
[84:24.87]Only hit extra buttons on the beat.
[84:26.53]Look at where the dots are.
[84:27.45]It's usually easiest to do at the end of the lines with this extra... No, fuck that song.
[84:32.86]Oh, this is loud.
[84:38.32]Much louder than the last one.
[84:46.17]But thank you, Ishanji.
[84:47.67]I'll get cool on some of these.
[84:50.37]Ow.
[84:52.67]Loud.
[84:53.51]Loud.
[84:55.75]Oh.
[84:55.89]I gotta turn this down on my end.
[84:57.94]What the hell is going on?
[85:06.56]Alright, wrap it up at two.
[85:16.39]I got this coupon at a burger shop.
[85:19.97]And I won a 100-year supply of noodle products.
[85:26.23]Since then, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I'm eating noodles.
[85:33.34]At first, I liked it.
[85:35.30]But now, I don't even want to look at it.
[85:39.91]The only thing that gets me going is the lovely Sunny Funny and her sweet smile.
[85:45.34]Her name is Sunny Funny?
[85:47.04]I didn't even know that's what her name was.
[85:58.97]I know.
[86:00.05]I got it.
[86:00.51]I got it.
[86:01.31]No.
[86:02.23]I can't believe.
[86:03.95]Parappa, I didn't know you were such a baby.
[86:06.31]Hey.
[86:13.48]But little did I know, this was the beginning of a long adventure.
[86:21.78]I actually don't know what the hell happened there.
[86:25.48]Say alright!
[86:26.75]Alright!
[86:28.05]Say oh yeah!
[86:30.35]Oh yeah!
[86:31.07]What you gonna do?
[86:32.85]Wrap up the wrap up.
[86:48.08]2002.
[86:48.20]Is this on PlayStation 1?
[86:53.12]Or PS2?
[86:53.44]I don't remember.
[86:54.44]I think it's PS1.
[86:56.04]Alright.
[87:03.93]City Hall.
[87:04.69]Load and save.
[87:07.37]Or Stage 1.
[87:09.47]Stage 1.
[87:11.01]Single play.
[87:12.91]That's what we're doing.
[87:19.61]Little 17-year-old Jeremy.
[87:22.52]I never... I don't... No, I didn't play this one.
[87:27.32]Beardburgers.
[87:28.02]A Parapatown tradition.
[87:36.94]Ah, I think Sunny hates me now.
[87:39.57]Of course she does.
[87:40.37]You didn't eat her cookie.
[87:41.95]Yeah, thanks for rubbing it in.
[87:43.77]Oh, um, well, maybe she doesn't hate you that much.
[87:47.47]You think so?
[87:49.25]Yeah, noodles, right?
[87:50.95]I sure can go for some noodles right now.
[87:53.07]Yum, yum, yum.
[87:54.05]No noodles for me?
[87:55.69]No way.
[87:56.89]No noodles.
[87:58.05]No noodles.
[87:59.29]Alright.
[88:00.35]Burgers rule.
[88:02.41]Feedburgers, a Parappa Town tradition.
[88:05.33]Come on, Parappa.
[88:10.56]Relax.
[88:11.02]It's breakfast time.
[88:13.86]Cook those burgers.
[88:18.12]Don't do it.
[88:18.74]Cook those burgers.
[88:21.08]Cook burgers.
[88:22.86]Turn the patty over.
[88:26.38]Turn the patty over, over.
[88:29.17]Turn it.
[88:29.93]Cook those burgers.
[88:33.33]I know how to do this
[89:01.70]When can I stop this?
[89:03.28]How do I get out of here?
[89:05.68]How do I leave?
[89:06.28]Holy shit, you have to restart.
[89:09.18]Don't freestyle.
[89:10.76]I can't help it.
[89:29.72]I have to.
[89:30.74]You know what I want.
[89:31.66]I have a traditional bed burger.
[89:34.08]Me too.
[89:35.05]And I want 10 of them.
[89:36.63]Noodles again?
[89:40.94]What happened to the traditional burgers?
[89:44.35]I appreciate the freestyle there.
[90:10.12]You're telling me to stop freestyling when the people in the game and the cutscenes are doing it too.
[90:26.15]Here we go.
[90:26.61]Alright.
[90:58.76]No freestyling.
[91:00.87]That's like saying a fish shouldn't swim.
[91:02.95]Come on, give me a break.
[91:29.19]I want to do I have to freestyle That was plus 52
[91:55.19]It's SpongeBob
[92:22.85]How do you French a fry?
[92:52.70]Sounds like SpongeBob
[93:10.05]What?
[93:42.11]Yeah!
[93:42.63]And then it's Mr. Krabs.
[93:43.79]That was a fun one.
[93:44.63]I like that one.
[93:45.53]Turn the patio over.
[93:46.31]Turn the patio over.
[93:47.61]Okay, save system file.
[93:49.27]What?
[93:49.83]Oh, it's just virtual machine.
[93:51.17]I get it.
[94:13.89]That seems pretty accurate.
[94:16.13]Saving now.
[94:17.03]Save complete.
[94:20.58]Okay.
[94:25.36]Stage two.
[94:28.00]Everyone's getting timed out for doing that.
[94:36.44]Yeah, well, you can't say it.
[94:48.12]This is where the phenomenon known as noodleization is taking place.
[94:52.38]All the food being served in this town is turning into noodles.
[94:56.23]Even ice cream?
[94:58.05]Whoa!
[94:59.39]Hey, I can't eat this.
[95:01.65]We have to stop this noodling thing.
[95:04.19]Maybe your dad can help us.
[95:06.05]He's an inventor, right?
[95:07.76]Yeah, I think he used to study noodles too.
[95:10.76]Well, let's go then.
[95:15.23]This was Rodney Greenblatt reporting live from Beard Burgers in Parappa Town.
[95:24.22]The town is named after... It looks like the Noodle Syndicate is finally taking action.
[95:28.50]Our lives will be in danger if we don't do something quick.
[95:32.21]Yaha.
[95:33.33]Especially sweet.
[95:34.97]Your favorite.
[95:35.73]Any which way, we've got to think of something.
[95:38.69]Not to worry.
[95:40.35]Look at this.
[95:40.85]Look at this.
[95:45.37]This will denutilize everything.
[95:48.47]Oh, the formal straight A student saves the day.
[95:52.19]So what is it?
[95:53.45]Well, push that green button on the TV remote control.
[95:57.66]The TV?
[95:58.14]Yeah, it's the same one.
[95:59.98]Why did you do that?
[96:01.22]I thought it'd be convenient.
[96:02.76]Just push that green button.
[96:04.28]That was like the Jerma one.
[96:07.54]No, not that one.
[96:09.38]The greener button.
[96:11.00]Oh, this.
[96:11.68]Why do I reference that as that's what it's called?
[96:16.10]That's the catwash.
[96:17.99]Green, but square button.
[96:20.39]This.
[96:21.55]It better be it.
[96:22.77]Yeah, that's it.
[96:24.37]Here goes.
[96:28.97]Now, what in the world happened here?
[96:31.13]Honey, we shrunk ourselves.
[96:32.45]Almost.
[96:33.41]Almost what?
[96:34.46]The noodles are almost perfect.
[96:37.08]That doesn't mean anything.
[96:38.98]What happened to us?
[96:41.12]Oops.
[96:42.66]I cut a few corners, but I didn't think we'd shrink.
[96:46.40]This is no joke.
[96:48.30]Don't worry.
[96:49.20]We just have to push the green button again.
[96:51.38]So where's the remote control?
[96:54.33]It's not the same actor talking back and forth.
[96:57.75]Where's Dad?
[96:59.03]Well, let's wait for him.

[114:30.66]Thanks to all of you, our first operation, Operation Burgers Into Noodles, has turned out to be a great success.
[114:39.38]We must take advantage of this outcome and keep expanding our operation.
[114:44.21]Shrimp noodles, chewy thick soup pasta, oriental ramen-type noodles.
[114:50.19]We must expose this artistic, precious food that mankind has invented.
[114:55.35]Now is the time.
[114:57.07]Stand up for what you believe in.
[114:59.11]Um, in noodles, that is.
[115:00.80]Let noodles take over the world!
[115:02.46]What's going on?
[115:13.99]As you may have noticed, some fool is trying to turn every fool in our town into noodles.
[115:21.05]Noodles!
[115:22.46]Now we must terminate this action and protect the precious artistic foods that mankind has produced, such as sweet cherry pie, spongy moist cake with frosting, destructively sweet chocolate brownies, strawberry jam donuts, roasted marshmallows with caramel, ice cold smoothies and can't forget those colorful jelly beans, custard cream pie.
[115:48.68]And so, we have assembled this special force to act against and stop this criminal movement.
[115:55.64]The future lies in your hands.
[115:59.02]Now, begin the mission!
[116:06.06]Ah, if only Papa Parappa could finish that de-noodle-izer.
[116:12.38]Come on, Parappa, relax.
[116:14.48]It's practice time.
[116:18.61]Alright.
[116:19.95]I don't want spoilers for the song, please.
[116:23.65]Okay, that's it.
[116:25.01]Good luck.
[116:29.45]No, you guys go that way.
[116:32.62]Special Armed Forces Training Camp.
[116:36.22]We'll turn you into a real man.
[116:40.26]A real man.
[116:45.74]What if I happen to like having diarrhea and like buying flowers for a girl?
[116:50.86]What the fuck is happening in this game?
[116:59.43]What?
[116:59.67]Oops!
[116:59.83]Shoulda study!
[117:09.78]Alright, here we go.

[117:52.56]Want to?
[117:53.34]Let's go!
[117:54.81]Come on!
[117:55.17]Paying this card, no change, don't mean a thing.
[117:58.49]Words to your brain, things not game.
[118:00.57]Ride the terrain, move with no pain.
[118:03.05]I come from the streets, no such thing as pain.
[118:05.39]Do the job!
[118:08.13]Do the flip.
[118:09.19]Double.
[118:11.41]To the left.
[118:34.09]Oops!
[118:34.35]Oh, fuck.
[118:34.69]I'm an idiot.

[119:12.46]Do it. Do it. Flick. Do it. Do it. Flick.
[119:40.06]Up the ramps we go, all the way.
[119:41.33]Up the ramps we go, all the way.
[119:42.81]Up the ramps we go, all the way.
[119:44.55]Come on now, we ain't got all day.
[119:46.93]Come on now, we ain't got all day.
[119:49.38]On the ramps, or on the trails.
[119:51.74]On the ramps, or just on the trails.
[119:53.98]Crazy speedin', let your body go.
[119:56.34]Crazy speedin', let your body go.
[119:57.93]Fuck!
[119:59.01]I was almost there.
[120:26.41]Yoda.
[120:26.97]Recap.
[121:05.76]That was cool I like this one
[121:42.85]It's time for the bonus game.
[121:49.22]When Kotamanegi is ready, push, kick, punch, or chop, but not before they are ready.
[121:56.06]Let's begin.
[122:11.74]Oh!
[122:38.52]Alright, come on.
[122:39.91]That's a dangerous job.
[122:41.79]Yeah.
[122:42.29]2162.
[122:42.37]You're watching the stream in 160p so you can truly experience the classic game.
[122:48.85]That's not a bad idea.
[123:11.23]Checking slot one.
[123:14.47]Are you sure you want to overwrite?
[123:16.13]I'm certain.
[123:17.83]Save complete.
[123:23.26]Alright, what's next?
[123:26.10]Five.
[123:27.42]Uh...
[123:36.37]I wonder how many of you guys are gonna give banned today just for that.
[123:38.86]You're gonna get like a 30 minute timeout.
[123:46.32]Good job, men.
[123:47.54]But never forget, training and real combat are two different things.
[123:52.38]Always keep up your training.
[123:53.86]Yes, sir!
[124:00.05]I hate being stiff.
[124:01.85]Yeah, my brain's stiff now.
[124:06.20]Scram!
[124:08.40]Scram!
[124:10.37]Scram!
[124:12.07]Yeah!
[124:12.93]Yeah!

[124:15.03]Parabrin PJ!
[124:15.77]The new members of the squad, listen up!
[124:21.35]The time has come for the real thing!
[124:31.88]Civilians are held hostage at a hair salon.
[124:34.46]Get out there immediately and rescue them.
[124:36.72]What?
[124:38.70]We're not prepared for this.
[124:42.00]We just trained.
[124:42.88]We sang a song for four minutes.
[124:44.44]Come on, Parappa.
[124:45.20]Relax.
[124:45.52]It's practice time.
[125:09.60]Okay, that's it!
[125:11.18]Good luck!
[125:11.66]Alright, I skipped that and the game was not prepared for that.
[125:15.36]Alright!
[125:15.80]Check that out!
[125:17.03]Everyone's head's turning into noodles!
[125:19.87]Wow!
[125:21.03]That's a cool afro!
[125:24.07]But that afro's growing bigger!
[125:33.06]Come on!
[125:34.06]We better hurry!
[125:39.52]Whoo, yeah, you're looking fine.
[125:42.88]This is the original octopus style.
[125:46.40]Parappa, help!
[125:49.22]He's known to do great haircuts, but he's gone bananas ever since that tape deck started rolling.
[125:54.79]He'll only do afros.
[125:58.41]Please, Parappa.
[126:00.57]Hey, how do you like my new hairstyle?
[126:03.09]I had it done at the hair salon.
[126:28.22]Guitar?
[126:54.61]Are we gonna get an Um Jammer Lambie appearance?
[127:05.83]We played the games in reverse, unfortunately.
[127:14.41]Playing air drums.
[127:20.50]I'm failing this one.
[127:22.34]I'm failing this one a lot.
[127:38.98]Ooh!
[128:07.53]Check, check, check.
[128:09.23]Check, check, check.
[128:10.68]Check it out.
[128:20.59]I just keep hearing SpongeBob.
[128:23.37]I hear SpongeBob.
[128:24.97]Every time.
[128:25.95]I'm ready!
[128:26.95]Shave, shave, trim, shave!
[128:46.40]Trim, trim, cut, cut, trim, trim.

[129:13.68]He's doing the SpongeBob.
[129:15.23]Hold on, wait a minute.
[129:40.12]Alright.
[129:41.58]I need to say die really fast.
[129:44.14]I'm redoing this level.
[129:45.72]I have to see this.
[130:14.86]Die didn't come up again.
[130:19.16]But if I go... Die die die die die die die die die die.
[130:21.58]We'll do that one again.
[130:26.24]But not yet.
[130:28.70]We're gonna go through the story first.
[130:31.29]That was a fun song.
[130:50.12]I'm just waiting for the one that's after this.
[130:52.60]This one here?
[131:02.71]This machine must be the problem.
[131:04.65]Let's have Parappa's dad check it out.
[131:07.91]Hmm.
[131:08.93]Hmm.
[131:09.97]So, this is what's turning everything into noodles.
[131:15.06]Whoa.
[131:15.54]This is rare.
[131:17.32]Whoa.
[131:18.82]Oh, my!
[131:20.38]This game is really rare.
[131:22.30]Hey, this is no time to be talking about games.
[131:25.20]This game seems to be the nerve of the Nautilizers.
[131:28.26]What?
[131:29.60]If we can overcome this software, maybe we can find a solution.
[131:33.32]But this game never hit the market.
[131:36.08]Why is that?
[131:37.94]That's because...
[131:43.77]I didn't know there was a room like this in my house.
[131:46.13]Dad has a Dexter's laugh.
[131:47.57]There was a strange rumor going on that everyone who could use this game could own these noodles in our world.
[131:59.72]Their bodies accepted nothing but noodles.
[132:02.84]Oh no, not that, please!
[132:13.77]Hmm, I can't concentrate in a very big room.
[132:33.18]Where did I put a... Found it!
[132:37.64]What, what, what?
[132:38.96]A picture of me and my wife on our honeymoon.
[132:42.87]She used to be really nice.
[132:48.04]No way.
[132:49.56]Pet stone from back in the days.
[132:52.48]This is rare stuff.
[132:54.08]Can you sell this to me?
[132:56.18]Oh, I got a whole bunch of those in the box back there.
[132:59.80]Can you sell this to me?
[133:02.64]You're real rough over here.
[133:06.46]Can you sell this to me?
[133:10.23]All this time I've had many many great teachers help me out But for me to become a real man
[133:40.04]Population incoming.
[133:41.22]VR?
[133:41.79]I'm doing a bicycle VR.
[134:01.85]Hey everybody, watch out for those flying noodles.
[134:04.46]Because if you don't do well here, all you get to eat are noodles.
[134:08.74]Here we go.
[134:09.56]Extra, extra, we've all about it.
[134:11.64]I'm back for more because my store's a bore.
[134:13.78]I travel door to shore, door to door, looking around for some perfect store.
[134:19.32]Cut the lettuce through toaster buns.

[135:31.81]Ooh, it's coming.

[137:15.72]Okay, I gotta bring it back.

[137:38.89]This rapping's getting worse.
[137:40.77]Oh shit, that's hard.
[137:42.01]We're good.
[137:42.39]Wow, that was close.
[137:43.47]I wanna see cool.
[138:09.70]I'll get cool on at least one level, I promise.
[138:12.36]I don't want to even do it.
[138:16.18]There's no rhythm or song here.
[138:17.82]It's just react to the people holding up stuff to break.
[138:40.03]Hey.
[138:40.25]Hey.
[138:57.53]I just don't wanna do it!
[139:02.06]I just don't wanna- I wanna just- How did I get to zero?
[139:33.13]Faraba kick-punch chops his way into five homicides.
[139:37.82]What the fuck?
[139:44.44]I wonder how many people are gonna get banned this time.
[139:51.26]Alright, I think there's only one or two more levels left.
[139:59.73]There's only one spot for one more after this.
[140:12.15]Why are people getting banned?
[140:13.28]Because they're writing capital A like 30 times.
[140:16.66]Because of the name of the save file.
[140:20.04]That's what's happening.
[140:21.22]Good job, son.
[140:22.48]Thanks.
[140:23.32]Now what do we do with this?
[140:25.04]Now we use sweets to confront noodles.
[140:28.49]Then stick this ROM into this unfinished denoodlizer.
[140:33.23]Now, it's complete.
[140:35.33]Somebody broke this down.
[140:40.24]Warning.
[140:41.00]Warning.
[140:41.84]We are under attack.
[140:43.36]Level two warning.
[140:44.42]The Noodle Syndicate is attacking our town.
[140:47.22]Repeat.
[140:48.10]Warning.
[140:48.90]Warning.
[140:51.38]Yes?
[140:52.44]What?
[140:53.20]A Noodle Syndicate tank?
[140:54.92]On the streets?
[140:56.06]Hello?
[140:56.90]What?
[140:57.62]The Noodle Syndicate took over the music store?
[140:59.99]The guitar strings turned into noodles?
[141:03.70]It's showtime men, hey, why don't you use my past inventions?
[141:10.26]Oh
[141:25.59]Noodles are the best, no doubt.
[141:27.53]Can't deny, taste better than water.
[141:30.39]But don't ask me why.
[141:31.75]Noodles.
[141:32.91]OK, that's it.
[141:34.35]Good luck.
[141:40.14]OK, here we go.
[141:52.47]Who's flying the airplane?
[141:57.51]Who's flying the airplane?
[142:25.01]Lamy?
[142:25.53]No, Lamy's not flying the plane.
[142:40.30]This is one of those dreams that you have that is so wild and ridiculous.
[142:45.71]You want to tell somebody, but it's so fucking strange and just fucked up that you can't tell anybody.
[143:06.25]You know how people play kickball and they put their head down on the bat and they spin around and then they try to kick the kickball and they spin around like 15 times?
[143:31.30]They use that script writing in this case.
[143:39.29]I hated that shit.
[143:55.68]Putting the bat on the ground and putting your head on it and spinning around.
[143:58.50]I always just half-assed it because I'm not doing that shit.
[144:00.82]I hate that feeling.
[144:02.29]In fact, if I see somebody spin around more than four or five times, I go, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[144:07.27]It makes me anxious.
[144:08.75]I go, don't do that.
[144:09.41]Stop.
[144:09.73]Please stop.
[144:16.10]Yahoo!
[144:18.00]It just doesn't get any sweeter than this.
[144:20.66]That must be the boss.
[144:24.19]I chipped my tooth doing that I hate that
[144:32.40]What do you think you're doing?
[144:33.58]Shut up!
[144:34.68]I hate burgers, and I'll tell you why.
[144:37.50]I was destined to become a burger shop owner from the day I was born.
[144:41.73]My dad was so into burger research that all I got to eat was burgers, burgers, burgers.
[144:46.69]Burgers for a snack, burgers for breakfast, burgers for lunch, and burgers for dinner.
[144:52.03]Even at my own birthday party.
[144:53.68]Hamburger, cheeseburger, hamburger, cheeseburger, baconburger.
[144:57.38]All my friends hated me for that.
[145:00.22]Even my mother, she ate so many burgers that... Did she pass away?
[145:04.41]No, she turned into one.
[145:08.66]But see, I always like noodles more than burgers.
[145:12.55]Actually, I love noodles.
[145:14.75]That's why I'm going to have noodles take over the world.
[145:18.25]Noodles are the flow.
[145:19.99]Noodles are the groove.
[145:21.43]And I'm gonna make everybody understand that.
[145:24.07]So let there be noodles.
[145:26.25]I represent for noodles, baby.
[145:28.47]You know that.
[145:29.41]I know I'm right.
[145:30.52]I know I'm right.
[145:31.48]Oh, I know I'm right.
[145:33.54]Oh, I know.
[145:33.88]I gotta believe.
[145:35.04]Hey, that's mine.
[145:38.00]That's my line.
[145:45.54]Yeah, yeah, we're gonna bring it down like this, y'all.
[145:48.70]I'm gonna let my man pour up with all that noodles rule the world.
[145:52.75]Yeah, yeah, that little slippery thing tastes so good all the time.
[145:57.49]Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[145:58.33]So it's a little something like this.
[146:00.27]Stay with me now.
[146:00.91]Here we go.
[146:01.85]Like this, like this.
[146:03.97]In parentheses, let me stress the fact
[146:08.78]The so-called doodles that you find in spaghetti Are sweeter than idols, do damage like machetes Without a doubt, I got the flow, coming at you live Bring the place alive, every single day I jive With the thought, comes my direct actions Ask my followers, they'll say it's an addiction Flourbit, suck it, I know you all like it Flubbit, suck it, I know we all like it Smell it, taste it, pasta in the morning
[146:31.69]Whoa!
[146:32.27]What the fuck?
[147:02.99]What?
[147:03.27]What happened?
[147:04.19]What?
[147:04.37]What?
[147:04.59]What's going on?
[147:05.69]What?
[147:05.83]What?
[147:06.05]What?
[147:07.01]What?
[147:07.69]What?
[147:07.97]Create my own spoon!
[147:09.75]As long as they love food.
[147:33.72]for even chopsticks.
[147:34.76]Come on, kid, get down with the mix.
[147:36.98]N-double-O-D-L-E-S.
[147:39.84]T-double-O-K-E-I-S.
[147:41.88]Great taste of pasta, blow to your chest.
[147:44.86]Great taste of sweets, blow to my chest.
[147:47.20]Ramen, udon, soba, you name it.
[147:49.97]Brownies, a pie, a shake, you name it.
[147:52.25]Any type of noodles you like, yes, I got it.
[147:54.79]Any type of sweets you like, you like, yes, I got it.
[147:56.91]You like type of... I'm just lying on the ground.
[147:59.97]Whatever your thoughts may be, I'm bound to be
[148:04.36]As the key.
[148:04.88]As the key.
[148:05.27]Full of prime glory, way up above.
[148:07.37]Because here I come, you're all full of noodles and love.
[148:10.17]Noodles are the best, no doubt.
[148:11.64]Can't deny.
[148:12.40]Tastes better than water, but don't ask me why.
[148:15.29]Noodles are the best, no doubt.
[148:20.10]But then again, many things can't be tasty.
[148:22.76]Cornbread, potatoes, rice, and even pastries.
[148:25.16]But then again, many things can't be tasty.
[148:27.90]Cornbread, potatoes, rice, and even pastries.
[148:30.25]So why do I love noodles so dearly?
[148:32.81]It makes no sense.
[148:33.81]I must have found it real eerie that part of you loved noodles.
[148:40.80]What the fuck?
[148:41.70]That was 300 points.
[148:42.30]Yeah.
[149:10.85]Um, you ever see this show on, I think it's on TLC, called Freaky Eaters?
[149:17.91]This is just a Freaky Eaters episode.
[149:19.23]Remember there was some lady that ate only cheesy potatoes?
[149:23.51]That's it.
[149:25.67]Every day.
[149:26.35]Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[149:27.29]It was cheesy potatoes.
[149:31.48]For like 20 years.
[149:38.62]Checking slot one.
[149:39.58]You can't do that.
[149:41.62]Are you sure you want to have a right?
[149:44.81]Saving now.
[149:46.13]What the fuck?
[149:46.67]She'd be dead.
[149:47.41]No.
[149:47.81]No, this is real.
[149:49.69]Okay, what if you get some time?
[149:51.73]Just go to YouTube and type in cheesy potatoes, freaky eaters.
[149:57.54]This is a real person.
[150:11.12]You can't make me.
[150:12.27]Well, that's why I said, like, if you have to, just, just if you feel like it, go watch it.
[150:19.65]Is this another level?
[150:36.50]You're gullible to think that's real?
[150:39.00]What, it's a made-up scenario?
[150:42.83]It's not made up.
[150:43.89]It's scripted.
[150:47.44]It's scripted.
[151:22.55]There are doctors on that show.
[151:24.27]But then soon we overcame them all.
[151:28.07]One by one, side by side, we hit each other.
[151:36.68]Love that's real, an everlasting bond.
[151:38.82]We were all.
[151:39.74]We've come a long way.
[151:47.75]After dark and sweet.
[152:09.82]Colonel Noodle's got us a stage to perform.
[152:12.08]How cool!
[152:13.52]Stage?
[152:19.38]Hey, Sonny.
[152:20.78]I've tried so many things to try and grow up.
[152:23.82]But I don't think I really did.
[152:26.23]So, for today's show, I'm just gonna do what I always do.
[152:31.56]Don't be silly, Parappa.
[152:33.44]You're man enough already.
[152:35.30]If you keep trying and never give up, you're already a grown-up.
[152:39.51]Yeah.
[152:40.83]I gotta believe.
[152:58.56]Final party.
[152:59.42]By the way, this is the last song that is ever in a Parappa game.
[153:04.28]You're about to hear it.
[153:16.47]And then they did a Kickstarter.
[153:18.51]And made like $41,000 out of them.
[153:20.69]Pepe's sad.
[153:30.19]It's party time, come on everybody You can do it, shake your body It's party time, come on everybody You can do it, shake your body Come on out on the floor Rock until you want some more Come on out on the floor
[154:13.31]I can't.
[154:23.76]everybody on stage all of you

[155:10.22]Finish it out here.
[155:11.12]Come on, please Oh

[155:37.19]Final!
[155:37.79]Final song!
[155:38.73]Let's go!
[156:11.42]I can't even hear what he's saying.
[156:13.29]I can't even hear what he's saying.
[156:14.55]I have no idea what he was saying.
[156:45.85]What?
[156:46.05]What happened?
[156:46.79]That was fucking ridiculous.
[157:18.80]Alright, so when I had cool, all I heard, I swear to God, this is the only thing I heard.
[157:36.68]I didn't hear anything.
[157:37.60]It was like the crowd yelling.
[157:38.94]I couldn't hear shit.
[157:41.64]I was trying to string together a sentence.
[157:42.98]I don't know what the hell was going on.
[157:45.92]and so that's the end of this funny adventure peace is back in parapatown being burgers loving the new art they're having a good time my friends are watching movies you know listening to music back to doing what they usually have cool ones but as for dad he's still coming up with those practical gadgets and using up all his family's money
[158:09.45]But as for me, I'm on my way to Sonny's for dinner.
[158:14.02]Wow.
[158:14.72]I can eat anything now.
[158:17.10]Anything but cheese.
[158:20.74]I want another lifetime supply of cheese.
[158:24.00]That sounds pretty great, actually.
[158:25.49]I don't have a problem with that.
[158:28.41]This image is shaking.
[158:30.49]It's pretty much...
[158:41.62]Too much cheese on that pizza.
[158:43.20]Yeah, that's a lot of cheese.
[158:50.41]Does it melt as you go down?
[158:56.97]It sounds ominous.
[158:58.61]Yeah, this does sound like when you put a song into G minor.
[159:03.75]It just sounds evil.
[159:12.11]I want that cheese to melt.
[159:20.91]The G major is the evil one.
[159:22.37]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[159:30.82]Bad ending.
[159:33.22]This is the cheese pizza ending.
[159:36.64]How is this a bad ending?
[159:56.57]The cheese is melting.
[159:59.65]That is actually kind of gross.
[160:03.61]Yeah, that's gross.
[160:11.58]It's in the shape of Parappa the Rapper.
[160:14.35]Okay.
[160:32.44]Alright, I think that's it.
[160:33.76]The wrap of the wrap of two.
[160:35.78]Okay, now... Is there any bonus stuff before we move on to the thing?
[160:42.67]I kind of want to see if there's any bonus material.
[160:51.68]I'll play three.
[160:52.68]Well, that's technically Um Jammer Lammy, but Um Jammer Lammy is technically two.
[160:59.92]So we played it out of order.
[161:01.76]It goes in the canon.
[161:04.20]It's Parappa the Rapper 1, I'm Jamer Lamy, Parappa the Rapper 2.
[161:09.61]We've played I'm Jamer Lamy already.
[161:12.23]So this is technically three.
[161:16.26]Checking slot one.
[161:20.32]Are you sure you want to overwrite?
[161:22.88]Saving now.
[161:23.88]Save complete.
[161:26.42]I'm surprised they didn't do a third game.
[161:29.64]Even like 2002?
[161:31.90]Nothing after that?
[161:32.72]You would think they would kind of round it out with a trilogy.
[161:34.50]Alright, what we got?
[161:39.18]I can do... What stage do I want to do?
[161:42.94]This one.
[161:45.51]I like this one.
[161:46.01]This is okay.
[161:46.91]These two are my favorite songs.
[161:49.89]These three.
[161:51.27]One, two, and three.
[161:53.65]Not in that order.
[161:54.85]One, two, three.
[161:58.89]In this, in that order.
[162:00.20]Alright, I want to try to get cool on this one.
[162:07.32]Rank, single play ranking.
[162:08.66]What does that mean?
[162:10.26]Is that hard mode?
[162:17.26]What does that mean?
[162:20.60]Ranked?
[162:23.06]Oh.
[162:24.25]Alright, let me try to get cool.
[162:41.28]Blue hat.
[162:42.38]What's my ELO in Parappa?
[162:44.12]I don't know.
[162:49.95]I'm beat.
[162:50.63]Me too.
[162:51.95]Hey, where is everybody?
[162:54.27]Yes, I can.
[162:54.91]Come on, Parappa.
[162:56.79]Relax.
[162:57.65]It's practice time.
[162:59.01]Pull the lever over.
[163:03.77]Blue hat means it's harder.
[163:06.02]Oh.
[163:06.54]Okay, that's it.
[163:07.90]Good luck.
[163:09.31]Let's see how badly I get shit on here.
[163:20.54]New hat, same Jerma.
[163:23.73]You wanna be big?
[163:26.31]Changes the notes too.
[163:27.33]You wanna grow big?
[163:30.17]Revolutions all the time.
[163:31.55]People changing the world with crime, with violence and anger, hunger, whatever.
[163:37.14]I find that ridiculous, if not meticulous.
[163:40.16]I do my best to guard my own premises.
[163:43.40]What's your name?
[163:44.00]What's your name, fool?
[163:46.30]What's my name?
[163:47.62]What's my name, fool?
[163:49.58]What's that sound?
[163:50.70]Who that be?

[164:01.62]You think you're big?
[164:02.82]You think you're big, kid?
[164:04.96]I think I'm big.
[164:06.30]I think I'm big, kid.
[164:08.04]It's your desire to grow back again.
[164:11.35]It's my desire to grow back again.
[164:13.91]You came to the right place.
[164:15.99]I'll make you big.
[164:17.38]Oh
[164:48.59]Damn it
[165:14.96]At the moment, I'm close to like getting the lever to fall.
[165:18.12]Is his controller broken?
[165:19.88]No, to get cool, you have to do like style points.
[165:31.25]You weren't dead.
[165:32.52]I must have been dream dreaming.
[165:34.18]You better believe it.
[165:35.54]My mind is like a demon.
[165:37.24]Better believe like your mind is demon.
[165:39.70]I'm a man.
[165:41.30]I'm going full Burgah Boy.
[165:42.28]Fuck it.

[167:21.74]I just did it.
[167:23.58]I did it and it got to the end of the song.
[167:25.66]What do you mean choke?
[167:27.64]What he meant to say is nice job winning uncool.
[167:31.49]Huh?
[167:32.63]Checking slot one.
[167:36.04]Are you sure you want to overwrite?
[167:38.30]Saving now.
[167:39.32]Save complete.
[167:43.82]Alright.
[167:45.20]Now I'm going to do this one.
[167:57.32]Winning on cool is all that matters.
[167:58.56]That's true.
[167:59.77]That's all that matters.
[168:08.23]How do I permanently delete this character from the game?
[168:14.55]Alright!
[168:45.04]Cutting hair can be fun.
[168:46.98]So don't just stand there.
[168:49.05]Come inside, have a seat, and relax.
[168:52.45]I promise you, everything will be alright.
[168:55.23]Okay, baby, let's go.

[171:14.02]I got... I had it at the beginning.
[171:17.80]I'm trying to hit the stars.
[171:19.62]Who did all of this?
[171:21.30]That's pretty good.
[171:22.50]You did.
[171:23.32]You told me to.
[171:44.30]Sounds like a remix.
[171:44.90]Yeah, you have to do... To get cool, you can't just do... Cut your hair!
[171:51.65]Do a perm!
[171:53.15]It's gotta be... Cut, cut, cut the hair!
[171:55.07]Do, cut, perm!
[171:55.99]That's how you do it.
[172:00.13]You gotta do it on the stars.
[172:09.17]Checking slot one.
[172:11.88]Hold L while entering a stage.
[172:13.94]Alright, let me try this other one.
[172:22.45]Let me try my other favorite song.
[172:24.33]Alright, hold L1.
[172:31.73]Cut, dive, perm, and block the hair.
[172:47.53]Hold L buttons.
[172:48.25]Hold L buttons.
[172:49.03]Does that work?
[172:49.75]Holding L. You hold it before you select the stage and hold it.
[172:53.43]Oh, whatever.
[173:13.38]Hold both L buttons while selecting lets you... Well, you guys got all this conflicting info.
[173:18.16]Hold L. Hold both L's.
[173:23.27]What?
[173:24.91]No, stop.
[173:25.43]What are you doing?
[173:28.23]Try again.
[173:28.79]No, stop.
[173:29.89]What the fuck?
[173:32.33]Okay.
[173:39.66]Hold both L's.
[173:42.49]I'm holding both L's.
[173:43.71]Did it work?
[173:44.87]No, it doesn't do anything.
[173:48.59]Come on, Parappa.
[173:50.15]Relax.
[173:50.63]It's practice time.
[174:11.64]You guys feed me some fucking bullshit info.
[174:26.47]Oh my god, I'm trying to skip this and it's pausing the game and you can't pause.
[174:30.80]I'm trying to skip this cutscene.
[174:32.82]Because it's a cutscene.
[174:34.14]I'm just trying to skip this and now I have to redo everything again.
[174:45.59]Alright, here we go.
[174:47.49]Come on, everybody.
[174:48.49]Let's go.
[174:50.19]Hop to it.
[174:51.47]Want to.
[174:52.21]Let's go.
[174:53.69]Come on.
[174:54.53]Don't get lower.
[174:56.19]Don't mean a thing.
[174:57.31]Time for cool.
[174:58.11]Work with your brain.
[175:00.45]Things not game.
[175:01.21]By the terrain.
[175:02.10]Smooth without pain.
[175:03.32]I come from the streets.
[175:05.60]No such thing as pain.
[175:07.40]Do the jump.
[175:07.96]Do the jump.
[175:09.48]Do the jump.
[175:10.48]Do the flip.
[175:11.80]Do the flip.
[175:12.82]Flip.
[175:13.40]Do the double dutch.
[175:16.93]Don't lose the grip.
[175:20.77]Don't lose the grip.
[175:22.81]Do the right to the right.
[175:25.90]Do the left to the right.
[175:34.62]I fucking panicked!
[175:39.04]I don't know why, I'm like holding this in fucking control with my whole palm.
[176:58.37]This is fucking absolute gibberish.
[176:41.04]Come on, let's put up a show.
[176:43.42]Time is up.
[177:16.22]I gotta do this every single day.
[177:17.92]You gotta do this every single day.
[177:20.84]You gotta tell you the truth.
[177:23.86]My hair's turning gray.
[177:26.03]Tell you the truth.
[177:27.09]Turning your hair gray.
[177:28.39]You may be old, bold, and with teeth gold.
[177:31.39]It really, really don't matter.
[177:42.34]Oh Fuck
[178:10.35]I'll do it again.
[178:17.31]The game has a cheat where if you press in the right stick and point it down before selecting single play and letting go once you start hearing- whatever you said.
[178:26.52]I can't follow that one.
[178:28.92]I have no idea what you're just trying to tell me to do.
[178:32.64]Alright, last one.
[178:33.54]Don't need to save it.
[178:34.76]One more.
[178:35.20]What's the one I want to really try to get?
[178:38.14]Um... I like this one.
[178:40.40]The hamburger one.
[178:42.43]Hold R3.
[178:43.33]Guys, I'm holding every button.
[178:49.51]Come on, Parappa.
[178:50.05]Relax.
[178:50.25]It's practice time.
[179:04.23]After this, I'm going to take a quick break after this.
[179:07.77]Parappa the Rapper has been really fun.
[179:10.25]It's a great game, great franchise.
[179:12.01]But we're going to move on to finish the thing.
[179:15.22]Let's do it.
[179:26.18]People saying they don't like this one?
[179:27.86]This is a great song.
[179:51.32]Come on.
[179:52.57]Well, I didn't- Give me a break.
[179:55.27]Stop.
[179:55.49]Do it again.
[180:22.39]I added some, and it's bad.
[180:27.83]I'm gonna try it every half beat, see what happens.
[180:29.45]What was I doing?
[180:50.76]What the fuck?
[180:54.77]I'm just doing it more times.
