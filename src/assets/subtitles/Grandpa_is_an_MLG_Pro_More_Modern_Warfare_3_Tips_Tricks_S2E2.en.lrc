[00:12.92]Hello everybody, welcome to episode 2 of Grandpa and the MLG's Row.
[00:19.82]Episode 2, I think I already said that.
[00:22.02]Anyways, this episode is gonna go back to the roots of the series, and we're gonna talk about some Modern Warfare 3 tips and some strategies, and I'm also gonna cover the Black Ops 2 trailer.
[00:37.91]It was stupid.
[00:39.88]That's it, okay?
[00:41.09]So let's move on to the Modern Warfare 3 tips part 2 that I can't cover.
[00:46.84]So tip number one, probably the most important tip in the whole video, is always run support and never choose anything above UAV.
[00:55.81]Just only select what the fuck is that?
[00:57.63]It's a dog.
[00:59.15]Only select UAV, and that's it.
[01:02.02]This is gonna really help your team out, especially the ones that get the MOABs.
[01:07.24]That's right, all you cool cats that get the MOABs.
[01:10.22]Never thank the little guy behind the scenes.
[01:13.11]And you really should too, so right now,
[01:15.21]Right fucking now we're going to start a campaign on Twitter with the hashtag that says support, because that's the joke, support TLG, support the little guy.
[01:25.99]And I want this to spread like a fucking wildfire.
[01:29.66]So do it right now.
[01:31.14]Stop watching this video.
[01:32.26]Do it now.
[01:33.16]Stop it.
[01:33.82]Click the pause button on this video right now.
[01:36.60]Go to Twitter and write it.
[01:38.50]So thank you very much.
[01:40.32]Did you do it?
[01:42.36]Did you do it yet?
[01:44.54]Okay, good.
[01:45.86]So when I get asked all the time in PMs and in comments, Grandpa, how do you pick the best perks and the best gun attachments?
[01:53.65]And when I tell them, I don't know.
[01:56.15]I have no idea.
[01:57.63]I pick my perks by closing my eyes and just selecting random ones.
[02:01.79]And the same thing for the attachments too, so I usually have something really fucked up.
[02:05.71]But that's how I do it, because I don't know how to do it otherwise.
[02:09.67]Wait, where is he?
[02:10.65]What happened?
[02:11.39]Where is John?
[02:12.38]Did you take John?
[02:13.00]Yeah, I took him.
[02:14.06]I dropped him off at school.
[02:15.24]He doesn't go to school, Grandpa.
[02:16.84]He's fucking two years old.
[02:18.10]Are you stupid?
[02:18.91]He'll be alright.
[02:21.65]So I've come to the realization in this video...
[02:25.61]I really don't know what I'm doing in this game.
[02:30.57]Because I always put up negative numbers.
[02:33.31]And I always don't do things right.
[02:36.27]And Jeremy always tells me I'm bad at stuff.
[02:38.53]For the record, I've never said that before.
[02:40.31]Well, this is a goddamn video you're supposed to make people.
[02:43.47]It's entertainment.
[02:44.93]You think the WWF is fucking real?
[02:47.51]I mean, no, but... Well, it is!
[02:49.72]It's real!
[02:51.32]Um...
[02:52.03]I think I'm totally missing your point, but that's okay.
[02:54.85]There is also something else you're missing.
[02:56.55]The fucking brain.
[02:57.77]Right here.
[02:58.72]Somebody up top.
[02:59.56]Come on.
[02:59.92]I deserve this.
[03:00.82]Right here.
[03:02.66]I'm the only other person in this room.
