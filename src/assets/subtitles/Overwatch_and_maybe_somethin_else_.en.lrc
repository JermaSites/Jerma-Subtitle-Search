[00:16.25]There are a lot of entertainment providers... There are a lot... Shut up.
[00:23.70]Fucking ads.
[00:28.16]Gosh darn ads.
[00:44.49]Well, hi.
[01:06.62]Cancel the secret campfire picnic plans.
[01:11.62]Were there secret campfire picnic plans?
[01:13.60]I didn't know about them.
[01:27.63]What's popping?
[01:29.13]I'm doing good.
[01:29.67]How are you?
[01:38.21]I'm really sore right now.
[01:43.67]So, you know, I'm in the gym.
[01:45.37]I'm out of the gym.
[01:46.01]I go to the gym.
[01:46.82]I leave the gym.
[01:48.84]I leave the gym for four months.
[01:50.92]I don't work out for four months.
[01:52.18]You know how you do that?
[01:52.80]You go back and forth.
[01:54.57]Well, I just recently started to work out again.
[01:57.55]After not doing it again for a few months.
[02:01.02]Or way more than that, probably.
[02:03.68]But I just did push-ups and sit-ups just to get my body used to what it was like to move.
[02:09.61]And my whole body hurts.
[02:11.47]I forget what this felt like.
[02:14.19]It hurts.
[02:16.53]A lot.
[02:29.01]I'm going to start off with mustard fat.
[02:37.24]You got it on your computer just in time.
[02:40.46]You did.
[02:42.28]So I don't know if I'm going to play Overwatch the whole time.
[02:45.51]I probably will.
[02:46.93]I don't know how long I'm going to stream for.
[02:49.09]I just don't know.
[02:51.71]But there's one thing for certain.
[02:53.43]I'm going to kill this Widowmaker in Skirmish.
[03:00.70]She's gone.
[03:03.66]Hold on.
[03:04.16]Very important.
[03:04.80]Before we start playing, we always have to rebind our melee.
[03:08.04]It's always gone.
[03:12.13]I want to make sure I don't miss something here.
[03:17.45]Am I missing something?
[03:20.51]It just saves it, right?
[03:21.61]It's just been bound.
[03:26.06]Okay.
[03:26.30]Okay.
[03:30.00]What other games do I have in mind?
[03:30.82]I don't know.
[03:31.10]I'm gonna see where the night takes me.
[03:33.86]I do want to be able to have time to make a video.
[03:38.30]Because I want to upload something either tomorrow or the next day.
[03:41.50]Or shoot for uploading tomorrow or the next day.
[03:45.82]But, I don't know, you know, sometimes you just gotta chill and turn your stream on.
[03:49.42]That's what we're gonna do.
[03:53.46]Can I explain the first law of thermodynamics?
[03:57.75]Now that is for a teacher, which I am not.
[04:01.27]Sorry.
[04:01.59]It's taking a while.
[04:08.91]Three minutes.
[04:20.87]When and where are we going to unlock more planets?
[04:23.87]Soon, I would say.
[04:27.91]There's got to be at least the sun and the earth.
[04:30.11]Those are the next two that are coming down.
[04:31.77]The pipeline.
[04:36.71]What happened to the lighter germ of moon?
[04:38.14]I actually got it removed because I was going through how many emote spots I have.
[04:45.38]And I'm like, you know what?
[04:46.38]This is just taking up a spot for no reason.
[04:48.50]And it was confusing people.
[04:50.34]So I contacted Twitch support and they got rid of it.
[05:00.21]I did play Stanley Parable.
[05:02.71]It was an enjoyable experience.
[05:09.25]Can you explain the first law of aerodynamics?
[05:11.18]Yeah, absolutely.
[05:13.64]Shit's happening in the sky.
[05:16.42]That's it.
[05:19.36]If you tell your professor tomorrow, first law of aerodynamics, it's shit happens in the sky.
[05:25.71]He's going to be like, I should have been.
[05:27.43]He's going to go to the blackboard.
[05:29.68]He's going to ride it on the blackboard.
[05:32.12]You're going to get 20 points extra credit for the rest of the time you study in any school.
[05:37.66]And you're going to be on a Wheaties box.
[05:43.40]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[05:47.86]Pimping Chicken just subscribed.
[05:49.84]Welcome to the chicken chunkers, man.
[05:58.37]Thanks a lot.
[06:03.80]Oh, there actually is a new sub sound.
[06:06.46]Only for resubs, though.
[06:10.68]If you are a returning subscriber and you're about to be ready to pay again, I guess, or however it works, monthly.
[06:23.64]Yeah, welcome to the fucking chicken chunkers.
[06:32.12]Oh my god, a lot of people.
[06:39.70]Get off that roof!
[06:45.14]I wanna go up.
[06:52.59]Oh, come on!
[06:54.83]Funnily enough, she didn't know where I was.
[07:01.70]I just don't want to get pulled out of the air.
[07:02.90]Genji on the right.
[07:09.40]What a bad place.
[07:13.58]I shouldn't be over here.
[07:14.70]You thought it was the dribble coaster?
[07:21.53]Well, it changes day to day.
[07:30.71]Holy crap.
[07:42.92]She died.
[07:44.11]I'm okay.
[07:45.45]I'm okay with her taking that one air shot and then dying.
[07:48.63]Could have been better.
[07:51.13]Could have been worse, too.
[07:57.30]Right on target.
[08:02.18]Watch out behind the truck.
[08:04.46]There's a guy behind the truck.
[08:05.22]I can probably just go over and ult.
[08:11.26]That's probably what I'm going to do.
[08:15.23]Alright, we did good.
[08:18.71]I didn't kill anybody.
[08:20.27]Except for like the one Roadhog.
[08:25.62]Thank you for the heals.
[08:33.55]Reaper's behind us, too.
[08:40.99]Damn it!
[08:43.98]Genji down.
[08:44.62]The moon emote is terrifying.
[08:45.74]It's supposed to be terrifying, I think.
[08:49.34]Or is it?
[08:49.70]I don't know.
[08:49.96]It's just a picture of the fucking moon.
[08:51.40]That Reaper's still behind us, though.
[09:02.07]Yeah, did I do it?
[09:03.37]Oh, I thought I did it.
[09:14.51]Got ya.
[09:21.76]Fuck!
[09:28.70]Don't fear the reaper.
[09:30.42]Well, sometimes you have to fear the reaper.
[09:33.31]I'm just gonna go after I get this ult, I'm gonna go somebody else.
[09:37.33]It's actually been a couple days since I played.
[09:40.46]I have not played Overwatch in two days.
[09:47.08]Personally welcome my viewers to the derma stream.
[09:48.92]Welcome to the land of the chicken chunkers, my friend.
[09:50.58]Yeah.
[09:51.64]Half-priced chicken.
[09:55.14]Awww.
[10:00.29]This guy doing all kinds of skipping around.
[10:05.66]Yeah, he's just gonna get away, isn't he?
[10:09.20]Come on.
[10:10.58]The Genji's behind us, so... Yeah, I'm currently trying to wait till he tries to get the health back!
[10:17.59]And there he is.
[10:18.69]Doesn't matter.
[10:24.85]Oh my god, I just could not hit this fucking guy to save my life.
[10:32.99]I even knew he was gonna get the health back too, but whatever.
[10:36.91]That erratic double jumping.
[10:40.00]Oh, fuck.
[10:51.66]Man, this is what happens when you play this game for a week straight and then don't play for like two or three days straight.
[11:03.53]And then come back and turn your stream on.
[11:11.79]Sorry, we're gonna get this happens we get warmed up We suck total ass for like five straight games, and then we start playing well.
[11:19.44]That's what happens when we stream this game Oh my lord.
[11:31.41]Oh my lord.
[11:31.99]No.
[11:33.99]Oh
[11:38.31]Your English teacher is really stupid and mean?
[11:42.51]Uh... Well, some teachers are just mean, man.
[11:46.98]That's what happens.
[11:50.34]Sometimes you just have a mean teacher.
[11:55.98]Describe what I'm wearing?
[11:57.94]I'm wearing a pair of shorts and nothing else.
[11:59.79]That's it.
[12:10.53]Genji jumped over all the bullets.
[12:12.35]I need to change to something else to warm up here.
[12:18.61]Let's go with... Let's go with Junkrat.
[12:33.16]It's a perfect day for Mayhem.
[12:36.54]Is there a TF2 update?
[12:39.00]What do they have?
[12:40.98]Was this the fabled, the absolutely fabled matchmaking update that they've been thinking about doing?
[12:47.78]I'm gonna have to like take a look at our website to find out.
[12:57.76]Shit.
[13:07.36]Dammit.
[13:07.76]I was thinking I could hit him with that, but I didn't.
[13:13.29]This guy has my numbers so bad.
[13:14.83]It's a competitive beta.
[13:22.21]Well that's interesting!
[13:23.27]Go on to the rob.
[13:25.89]What's going on dude?
[13:27.56]Thanks for something.
[13:50.76]Oh... Where are you going, Lucio?
[13:52.64]I'm gonna get in a safe place and... I'm just doing it up here.
[13:58.28]Nope, I can't be up there.
[13:59.18]Let's do it here.
[14:00.20]Fuck it, who cares?
[14:02.18]Are you serious?
[14:08.57]Perfectly timed, accidental.
[14:23.26]Trying to launch him around.
[14:27.89]Damn it.
[14:30.55]I took your friend's marker at PAX East and I never gave it back.
[14:37.23]Was it the gold one?
[14:38.15]Was it the gold one?
[14:40.67]I remember having a gold Sharpie and I forgot where it came from.
[14:50.76]No.
[14:51.94]Oh well.
[14:54.76]My squeaky chair, too.
[14:56.04]I think it's like WD-40.
[14:57.04]I have a real squeaky-ass chair.
[15:01.91]I'm going to take a look at what this TF2 update is, though.
[15:08.17]I'm just curious.
[15:10.59]I am curious right now.
[15:19.80]Uh... Tough Break campaign passes are 50% off.
[15:27.78]and that's all I really see here where did it just happen added content and features necessary to begin limited public testing wasn't this already in the game for a while no I thought they already were testing that with various people
[16:00.45]I guess not.
[16:06.59]They were, but maybe it wasn't a... 100% released beta.
[16:14.39]Kind of like this game.
[16:21.96]Attack.
[16:22.50]Alright.
[16:22.92]Let's shake the cobwebs off here.
[16:29.00]It's half a gigabyte?
[16:30.10]That's actually pretty huge.
[16:49.16]You guys are... Everyone's real thirsty for Germa Rumble, huh?
[16:53.96]We'll drink it up soon.
[16:56.20]Because in a couple months...
[16:59.47]It's gonna be a fine wine.
[17:01.28]Do I like Mad Max Fury Road?
[17:08.68]I actually watched Mad Max.
[17:19.29]on the couch, and I was asleep for half of it.
[17:23.09]Not because I didn't think the movie was good.
[17:25.44]I was very tired, and I heard it was really good, and I wanted to watch it, but I was so sleepy that every 30 or 40 minutes or so, my eye would just pass out, and then I'd wake up, and he was on a car.
[17:38.28]He was tied up to a car with a face mask on.
[17:43.31]Shao Kahn was in the movie.
[17:46.73]Um...
[17:49.14]That's all I remember.
[17:51.47]It's all about this water.
[17:52.31]They like dump water on it.
[17:53.19]There's like a bunch of water they dump down.
[17:56.91]This was pretty recently too.
[17:58.97]What a sleepy weenie.
[18:03.21]Yeah, I don't really.
[18:04.91]I don't disagree with you.
[18:05.79]Stay alive, you two.
[18:21.93]Wow, that took a long time.
[18:23.87]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[18:28.11]Potato!
[18:29.55]What's going on?
[18:30.49]Thanks for subbing.
[18:32.05]Potato3?
[18:33.17]Potato03?
[18:33.83]Or is it Po-Po-TAY-TO3?
[18:39.31]Welcome to the jock-shockers.
[18:43.77]Is it on Winston?
[18:48.37]It is.
[18:48.97]Good.
[18:49.77]That's who I want it on.
[18:57.62]What even killed me?
[18:58.44]Wait, hold on.
[19:02.33]Zarya killed me?
[19:05.61]Ow!
[19:05.97]That... I took a lot of damage there at the end.
[19:09.22]Surprisingly.
[19:16.02]Where is it?
[19:16.72]It's gone now.
[19:24.52]Another one.
[19:25.72]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[19:28.47]I am in a Snuggie.
[19:29.67]Well, I hope you're comfortable.
[19:32.33]I hope you are comfortable, dude.
[19:35.57]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[19:42.59]Hey, order a dragon.
[19:46.13]Thanks for subbing for four months in a row.
[19:49.28]There's the new sound.
[19:50.28]Isn't it great?
[19:50.84]Isn't it new?
[19:56.19]Just go in.
[19:58.77]Oh my god, I don't think anyone knew I was doing that.
[20:00.47]Why is there only one fucking emote?
[20:11.27]I like just die.
[20:12.29]I should pay attention to the game.
[20:20.68]It's brand new.
[20:21.76]A brand new sub sound.
[20:23.48]Except it's just Orson Welles.
[20:26.92]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[20:31.19]Hey, smiling snakes.
[20:34.85]Just subscribe for the first time.
[20:39.65]I'm going to go Lucio or something.
[20:41.71]I need to start to pay attention.
[20:47.84]An Orson Welles emote.
[20:50.97]Not a bad idea.
[20:51.77]Alright, what if there was a second moon?
[20:58.97]Except this time it was Orson Welles' face and not mine.
[21:06.85]Now that would be fun.
[21:10.97]Yikes!
[21:19.34]Germo Orson.
[21:20.96]Orson Welles Moon.
[21:21.98]Maybe it could be a different planet.
[21:25.10]I'm not sure.
[21:29.53]Whatever it could be.
[21:40.65]I'm so scared of that noise.
[21:48.36]Get out of here, Zarya.
[21:51.94]Get out of here, Zarya.
[21:52.90]Nobody fucking likes you.
[21:54.20]Alright, I got an ult.
[22:03.29]I should probably use it right now.
[22:04.67]So we don't all die.
[22:09.07]Well, we all died anyway.
[22:12.74]I've got you in my sights.
[22:16.66]Well, it was for nothing.
[22:20.82]I'm going to catch a germitis.
[22:26.54]That's not a real disease.
[22:29.56]That's a fake disease.
[22:30.38]You just made it up.
[22:38.40]Have another moon, but it's just a regular moon.
[22:40.72]That's a good thought, too.
[22:47.72]I'm not against that.
[22:59.59]You love me in SpongeBob?
[23:01.11]Oh man, is that going on my permanent record?
[23:03.39]I just got here.
[23:06.37]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[23:09.43]TeaLeaf77, thanks for celebrating the French excellence.
[23:21.25]All right, come on.
[23:21.89]Shake off the cobwebs.
[23:23.09]Shake them off.
[23:23.63]Get them off of me.
[23:27.99]I'm better than this.
[23:30.20]There's a mirror right next to me right now.
[23:31.70]I'm looking right into it.
[23:32.46]Let me take off my glasses.
[23:33.78]You're better than this.
[23:35.40]You're going to go in the next Overwatch game and you're going to play top notch.
[23:39.38]You're going to get a bunch of hooks as Roadhog.
[23:41.22]People are going to be so impressed with you.
[23:43.58]And gosh darn it, people like me.
[23:46.91]What's that from?
[23:48.55]Anybody know?
[23:50.63]What's the end of that from?
[23:51.89]Come on.
[23:52.43]Somebody's gotta know.
[24:00.05]Come on.
[24:10.07]Saturday Night Live?
[24:11.57]What is it?
[24:17.23]That is not Orson Welles.
[24:19.38]That is not Forrest Gump.
[24:24.85]There you go, Stuart.
[24:28.45]Stuart.
[24:29.29]Stuart smiling.
[24:33.11]I'm good enough.
[24:34.40]I'm smart enough.
[24:36.06]And doggone it, people like me.
[24:51.23]Took me a while to remember his name.
[24:52.65]Yeah.
[24:53.83]Was that even... They did like a whole movie, didn't they?
[24:56.77]Was that originally a Saturday Night Live skit?
[25:00.25]Yeah, it was, I guess.
[25:03.66]I'm going to be going to PAX East.
[25:04.70]What PAX am I going to this year?
[25:06.00]PAX East.
[25:10.24]That is in Boston, Massachusetts.
[25:14.04]At the BCEZ.
[25:15.88]The Boston Convention and Exposition Center.
[25:19.71]I'll be there.
[25:21.89]All three days, hopefully.
[25:24.19]Weather permitting.
[25:31.80]How did you not die from that?
[25:33.98]Is what I don't know.
[25:35.94]Are you getting healed or something?
[25:39.55]Germ is pretty ripped.
[25:40.33]Not anymore!
[25:40.83]I'm just sore.
[25:43.67]I'm just really sore.
[25:44.65]I'm not ripped.
[25:53.06]Shirt in a can.
[25:53.78]Oh, that was hysterical.
[25:56.55]The best part is when Tim Meadows sprays it on himself and he goes, It's burning my skin!
[26:10.91]Come on, let's go.
[26:11.60]Let's go.
[26:11.96]Let's do it.
[26:21.92]The egg part, too.
[26:25.32]There doesn't need to be an egg part, too.
[26:37.20]Yeah, right.
[26:38.11]I'm just, you know, people ask why I don't have a webcam.
[26:41.93]Where's your webcam, Germo?
[26:42.95]Why don't you have a webcam on?
[26:45.47]Where is it?
[26:47.23]I would get banned from Twitch if I put my webcam on.
[26:51.09]Like a Twitch TV admin would be in here and I would be banned from the website.
[26:55.32]That's why there's no webcam.
[26:58.72]Because when we do this, we do this fucking naked.
[27:20.44]Damn it.
[27:21.00]He's looking straight in the camera, yeah.
[27:25.12]The old SNL fake commercials were so funny.
[27:30.17]Oops, I crapped my pants.
[27:53.42]What do I have for a team?
[27:55.72]It's okay.
[27:56.92]Let's get some great A hooks.
[28:00.09]Ooh.
[28:04.01]What the heck?
[28:06.57]No!
[28:07.27]Okay, good, he died.
[28:08.59]That was our exit strategy.
[28:12.88]That was the exit strategy.
[28:13.96]Ah, really?
[28:16.38]Genji...
[28:25.33]Genji, get the fuck outta here, huh?
[28:35.86]Alright, turn it on.
[28:39.12]Flip the switch.
[28:46.24]Just get on- move on the car, who cares?
[28:47.88]You know what I'm saying?
[28:50.42]Be the fat guy in the cockpit.
[28:53.39]Oh shit.
[28:55.13]Where's it?
[28:56.69]No, don't do it!
[28:57.55]I'm okay.
[29:04.49]Uh, sniper up there.
[29:06.77]Too fat to go that way, too fat to go that way, too fat, too fat.
[29:10.79]Am I just the only person on this thing?
[29:14.13]Am I gonna have to be cart Roadhog?
[29:18.80]Oh, what?
[29:24.14]Come on.
[29:32.20]Oh, he hit me right in the shin too.
[29:35.86]At least I got an ult.
[29:45.02]Anywhere I can send mail.
[29:48.32]No, I don't have like a PO box or anything.
[29:50.06]I was thinking about getting one, but haven't really pulled the trigger on it yet.
[29:55.78]Maybe.
[29:56.90]Hey.
[30:04.99]Well, if she didn't stop moving, I would have got her.
[30:18.60]Somebody capitalize on that.
[30:19.74]Put a capital letter in front of that.
[30:23.28]I pulled that guy all the way down.
[30:29.72]Pick it off.
[30:38.41]Damn it!
[30:42.41]Why do I feel like I'm always by myself when I'm not?
[30:44.67]Look at all these people around.
[30:56.91]I have a lot of problems with Lucios and Genjis.
[31:00.67]They're very erratic.
[31:01.71]And they're hard to determine what they're actually going to be doing.
[31:20.26]Merchandise.
[31:22.04]We don't have any merchandise.
[31:24.58]Not now.
[31:25.66]Not yet.
[31:26.10]But we did.
[31:32.28]Had a t-shirt not that long ago.
[31:33.96]I was thinking about maybe that being a yearly thing.
[31:42.55]Not necessarily the same shirt, but... I'm just going down the hall with this.
[31:52.57]For some reason, I thought she was going to get knocked around from that.
[31:56.17]But... I guess, did I even hit her?
[32:01.68]Okay, whatever.
[32:08.70]A Glue Man shirt.
[32:09.36]Yeah, the Glue Man shirt was...
[32:12.25]I like that shirt.
[32:15.51]I have secured the... Don't you get hit by any of that dumb shit that you're gonna be throwing at me.
[32:28.82]Oh nice, I said I had an ultimate.
[32:32.70]I got launched.
[32:44.01]That was a Zenyatta ult.
[32:45.77]Just me and him.
[32:55.51]I have a couple of ideas for new shirts, but I don't know what one I want to do.
[32:58.90]Because if I'm going to do it like once a year, it's going to be something I want to really care about.
[33:04.94]That's another tire.
[33:16.43]I'm just, whatever, I'm gonna get headshot in two seconds here.
[33:20.99]Ow.
[33:22.37]Ow.
[33:24.43]Shit.
[33:25.99]We need a Reinhardt or a Winston or something.
[33:30.81]Can't really do much as Roadhog right now.
[33:34.29]Unfortunately.
[33:35.09]I tried.
[33:38.87]I tried.
[33:40.77]I tried.
[33:53.40]German moon shirt.
[33:54.30]Yeah, we talked about that a couple days ago.
[33:58.34]That'd be terrifying.
[34:01.40]I'm not sure I'd want anybody to have that shirt.
[34:05.52]I would see it from across the way at like a convention and I'd be scared of it.
[34:15.13]I have an ult, but I just can't turn this corner.
[34:21.05]Shit.
[34:25.17]Yeah, I don't know if this is going to be a thing.
[34:27.85]Everybody's on it now.
[34:29.35]Where the hell did the whole team just came from?
[34:36.60]We all just decided to be on it at the same time, apparently.
[34:42.92]Just barely.
[34:45.10]Almost.
[34:48.37]Well, I spoke too soon, apparently.
[34:52.25]Allegedly I spoke too soon, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:55.65]I feel like I'm doing a lot of walking.
[35:02.28]Am I?
[35:02.56]Am I doing too much walking?
[35:04.62]I don't know.
[35:09.51]What's going on here?
[35:10.39]Where's the enemies?
[35:21.51]Damn it.
[35:22.49]I knew she was gonna be somewhere.
[35:24.61]Just didn't know where the hell she was gonna be.
[35:30.74]I knew it.
[35:31.78]I knew it was gonna be a trap.
[35:32.96]I thought he's dead.
[35:35.48]For him.
[35:35.82]That was odd, I will admit.
[35:53.50]Who else?
[35:54.52]Who else can I snag?
[35:55.72]Not that I'm getting any kills with this.
[36:09.22]Oh, you... What was... Oh, it was the tire.
[36:17.20]He went all the way around and stuffed that between my legs.
[36:33.67]It's alright, I still got him.
[36:37.61]I don't think we're going to win this.
[36:40.51]That would have taken a while to guess.
[36:43.87]Just trying to stay on it and... Here comes... Here comes this thing.
[36:58.56]Well, I tried.
[36:59.16]That's all you can do.
[37:08.68]And we're still going.
[37:16.02]And I'm running super fast.
[37:17.38]Just like Sonic the Hedgehog in that game Sonic the Hedgehog.
[37:22.19]Is he a molten core again?
[37:25.51]Get out of my way!
[37:28.25]What a useless attempt.
[37:31.87]Squeaky Squawk shirt?
[37:33.87]That would just be a bird.
[37:35.09]Here's what that shirt would be.
[37:38.15]That would be a bird.
[37:38.95]A little green bird.
[37:43.55]Like a little parakeet.
[37:45.43]It would have its head tilted up with its mouth open, screaming.
[37:48.84]A really large, wide open mouth.
[37:51.26]With just like a squawk coming out of his mouth.
[37:53.90]And his legs would be like eight feet long.
[37:57.44]And his body would be a regular bird body.
[38:06.07]That's what that shirt would be.
[38:08.85]And it would be $39.99.
[38:09.57]Sometimes you gotta fuck it up for what you sell.
[38:25.10]A shirt with a biapos like a calendar girl?
[38:27.40]How do I throw money at that?
[38:42.57]That would be great.
[38:45.27]That would be great.
[38:50.87]Or I was thinking even just a Biaz face with a bunch of bruises on it.
[38:54.63]And like a bloody lip.
[38:57.21]He's been in like a shitload of fights.
[38:58.33]Like a really heavily detailed face.
[39:01.63]Not a cartoon.
[39:02.53]A legit, highly detailed sketch of Biaz just with his face all beat the fuck up.
[39:11.86]Just staring like... Alright, well, the Roadhog game seems to be the one that's on point today.
[39:24.59]So we're gonna do it.
[39:30.94]I would buy it, but not wear it in public.
[39:38.29]See that, okay, that's a shirt that, if you wanna talk about a marketing person, or an advertising sense, a marketing agency,
[39:48.48]Let's do a focus group.
[39:49.88]Okay, so of that shirt, somebody said they would not wear it.
[39:54.28]They would not want to wear this shirt in public.
[39:58.35]That's like a red flag to any marketing person.
[40:00.91]What are we doing?
[40:02.77]That sounds like a legit comp.
[40:06.49]But I want to play Roadhog.
[40:10.05]Alright.
[40:10.51]Okay, I'll do it.
[40:19.08]I thought we were doing it.
[40:21.58]I was lied to.
[40:25.29]Alright.
[40:26.81]And one healer.
[40:27.37]It's fine.
[40:27.75]It's perfect.
[40:29.15]I'm fucking terrible as regroup.
[40:30.43]Why did I do this?
[40:31.05]Ninja's too OP.
[40:32.53]We don't need him.
[40:36.52]Oh my god.
[40:36.86]They got a turret in there?
[40:37.86]God damn.
[40:51.04]I need healing.
[40:59.24]And I forget where the health packs are every time.
[41:02.16]I can't with that turret and the shield blocking me.
[41:07.60]I fucking don't know anything.
[41:10.10]Oh man, we're gonna need a Pharah.
[41:16.61]Alright, that was fun.
[41:17.53]Alright, change it back to Roadhog.
[41:28.13]I'm multi and I'm switching.
[41:31.21]This stride didn't work.
[41:32.33]Go the other way, go the other way.
[41:35.15]Let's see if I can grab somebody.
[41:37.29]I'm gonna stop burping!
[41:46.80]Ah, too much damage in one second.
[41:51.84]I want to get that Zenyatta.
[41:57.06]That's the person I didn't want to grab, but you know what?
[41:58.68]Sometimes you have to grab somebody.
[42:07.11]Sometimes you just gotta get hit with all that stuff and just die because he has his ult going right now.
[42:15.07]You know, I blame this on being Reaper for no reason.
[42:17.99]I'm dying.
[42:26.18]Jarvis.
[42:27.24]Zeus.
[42:28.90]Make a Bia birthday card that just pukes when you open it.
[42:33.40]Hey, Bias don't puke.
[42:35.46]Come on.
[42:35.84]They're better than that.
[42:37.98]I think we're dead.
[42:40.76]Did I kill one person?
[42:42.49]I don't think I got one kill.
[42:57.96]Apparently somehow I got to know words.
[43:02.66]I Think we just need to go with the plan and go six peepers You know, I would love to have just like a bunch of I want to make sure I can like talk, you know uninterrupted I'd love to have just like a shitload of merchandise That like just was fun
[43:26.28]But it actually is work for the artists and having to make sure I set it up and get the right image.
[43:33.20]Because I'm a psychopath, guys.
[43:34.78]I am a fucking crazy person.
[43:37.12]I need the image, whatever it is, to be something that I love.
[43:44.71]If I don't love it, I don't want to do it.
[43:46.11]There goes the Zenyatta.
[43:59.80]Harassment.
[44:00.50]Harassment!
[44:02.72]At least I got the bubble down.
[44:17.41]And I always told myself I didn't want to ever have just a shitload of stuff.
[44:22.43]Oh, here's your German fucking coffee mugs.
[44:24.77]German, uh, desk lamps.
[44:29.05]Oh, what's that?
[44:29.91]A germa cell phone cover.
[44:31.47]Who gives a shit?
[44:32.35]Who the fuck wants that?
[44:33.97]Who wants a germa cell phone cover?
[44:38.49]I would rather pay you to take that than to put it in the trash.
[44:43.26]You know what I mean?
[44:45.76]The whole idea of merchandise is just odd to me.
[44:54.05]Here's the Zenyatta.
[44:59.69]I need a team.
[45:02.73]I need a team.
[45:05.41]I want one.
[45:06.79]But you don't.
[45:07.35]You really don't.
[45:26.18]Okay, that's the fastest I've ever got fucking destroyed.
[45:28.54]We got three fucking Reapers.
[45:29.94]Is that really this happening thing going on here right now going?
[45:36.00]Well, I might as well just play fucking something goofy.
[45:46.37]A germ of thigh-hides?
[45:55.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[45:58.24]I think you can penetrate our forces.
[46:17.27]Turning into Orson Welles.
[46:23.38]You can't come to play.
[46:24.48]Sorry, Torbjorn.
[46:26.04]You can't come to the party.
[46:26.98]Mousepad?
[46:27.46]No.
[46:27.68]Diapers?
[46:54.29]I think they're just gonna win.
[46:58.13]Spam.
[46:59.13]Just spam in there and hope you get a headshot.
[47:01.47]Maybe you'll kill someone.
[47:07.20]Freeze the turret!
[47:09.30]Freeze the turret!
[47:11.18]Frozen.
[47:17.65]Sunglasses?
[47:24.29]You guys have a lot of great ideas.
[47:28.97]For the germa candy bar, though, I would have to piss in the vat of sugar.
[47:31.97]That's the only way it would be mine.
[47:34.49]It would just be... I would just go to the Hershey factory and just watch all the workers and copy the... Just copy their recipe.
[47:42.64]Just take the chocolate bar.
[47:44.54]Exact recipe.
[47:45.82]Except mine, I piss in the vat.
[47:48.54]And I sell it.
[47:50.50]And it actually says it's made with 100% real germa piss.
[47:58.48]And it would say not for human consumption.
[48:02.42]Not intended for human consumption.
[48:07.40]For a legal standpoint.
[48:21.66]Pretty sure Hershey's chocolate already has piss in it.
[48:30.72]Right now, the Hersey executive is just like, that bastard thinks he can steal my piss recipe?
[48:36.84]I've been pissing in the Hersey vat for fucking 40 years.
[48:39.55]He thinks he can steal that from me?
[48:41.95]He's got another thing coming.
[48:45.53]Send the lawyers.
[48:46.19]Right there.
[49:01.53]I'm gonna try Pharah again.
[49:12.40]You're from Hershey, Pennsylvania?
[49:15.72]Well.
[49:17.56]Alright.
[49:19.48]I didn't have any response to that.
[49:21.64]No!
[49:22.04]We're not doing this!
[49:24.48]Why does this team just want to lose game?
[49:29.07]Hold on, I need to complain.
[49:31.33]We need a better team comp than this, guys.
[49:45.67]I'm down to always have fun.
[49:47.33]But if you have... Four Genjis... We're gonna fucking lose!
[49:51.88]We could have three Genjis and three Zenyattas.
[49:56.14]Are you Karma?
[50:12.46]That was just awkward silence.
[50:22.84]I don't know why that was so funny to me.
[50:46.33]No.
[50:46.79]No, we're not playing Pharah.
[50:47.59]It's already been proven that I can't play Pharah today.
[50:54.20]No.
[50:54.72]No.
[50:55.24]No.
[50:59.48]I'm in a very weird mood right now, guys.
[51:04.46]If you're curious.
[51:07.22]Those of you that know, I get like this sometimes.
[51:11.40]Yeah, nice ice wall.
[51:12.46]Didn't get shit.
[51:20.27]At least we actually have a tank now.
[51:21.95]That should be good.
[51:22.59]Wait, you're going to charge me?
[51:27.89]Is that what you want to try to do?
[51:28.81]Oh...
[51:33.17]Don't even... He did charge me.
[51:35.29]It doesn't matter.
[51:38.79]You're always weird.
[51:40.49]I don't think I am, though.
[51:43.31]I would say my weird to normal ratio is probably like 60-40.
[51:46.77]There's like a 40 percentile there where I'm acting pretty normal, right?
[51:55.12]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[51:59.92]Cakes EA.
[52:01.42]Or Cake SEA.
[52:02.54]I'm not sure.
[52:03.00]Thanks for something.
[52:05.94]Appreciate it.
[52:08.55]Welcome to the champagne suckers.
[52:13.43]Whatever fucking name we've been saying since I started.
[52:18.21]But thank you very much.
[52:20.23]I very much appreciate it.
[52:24.99]damage boost really I'm just gonna smash this dude no I'm not he's gonna kill me oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy the battle is not over
[52:56.67]There's a 13 second delay between the sub and the sub sound.
[53:02.17]Oh, this guy did that.
[53:06.72]Who cares?
[53:13.26]What is going on?
[53:14.12]I have no idea what just happened.
[53:19.70]If I could explain what happened, I would do it.
[53:22.05]But I can't.
[53:25.55]He charged me, but then I got out of the charge and I started charging, but then I fell out of it.
[53:28.81]That was really odd.
[53:35.89]Alright, let's make a push here.
[53:47.78]No more fucking around.
[53:54.89]Who are we playing against?
[53:57.25]Are these players?
[53:57.91]Really?
[54:12.70]Come on!
[54:14.02]Get him!
[54:22.59]I actually really... We already have a Winston.
[54:26.94]We already have a Junkrat.
[54:32.33]I'll stay Reinhardt.
[54:39.05]How many times... Yeah, I don't have a command for my sub sound.
[54:52.58]It just plays when somebody subscribes.
[54:56.20]That actually kind of helped.
[54:56.88]Looks like I'm gonna die.
[55:01.79]Because he's a Hanzo?
[55:07.47]I'm not good with Hanzo at all.
[55:10.43]I'm a terrible Hanzo.
[55:13.54]Double Winston?
[55:14.12]I think it's a little too late.
[55:18.00]If we can't even push out this far.
[55:22.07]Who's to say we'll push out there with two Winston's?
[55:26.39]I'm just going in, who cares?
[55:30.73]I am distracting them very much so, but I guess it didn't matter.
[55:37.17]I almost have an ult.
[55:48.16]Maybe that'll help.
[55:53.41]Get me out here.
[55:54.01]How come every time I say I don't care anymore, we end up like Star Trek win games?
[56:08.33]Wonderful telephone.
[56:12.21]Just get me out!
[56:14.27]Wonderful telephone.
[56:15.55]Thanks for subbing.
[56:18.33]Appreciate it.
[56:19.21]Welcome.
[56:20.20]Enjoy your stay.
[56:22.78]Hope it's a long one.
[56:25.20]Hope you have a very long, healthy life.
[56:29.61]You're welcome.
[56:32.33]Can I see some fucking moons in the chat?
[56:35.81]Even though there already are a bunch of moons in the chat.
[56:45.30]Oh, we're apparently moving.
[56:52.35]What's up with the Choose Your Own Adventure book?
[56:55.49]I've talked about it a couple times already, but... Pretty much... Pretty much... I severely underestimated the amount of work that goes into writing a book.
[57:10.59]And it's not like it's never going to happen.
[57:13.38]But it's something that went on the very severe backburner, especially since I had to move.
[57:19.40]And really, since I moved, I kind of just...
[57:22.65]I'm in a different space, and I don't know, I haven't gotten into the mode to want to write any more of that book in this new space.
[57:31.57]If that makes any sense, I don't know.
[57:33.36]You guys are going to be like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[57:35.36]But it's true.
[57:46.07]But priorities changed.
[57:47.15]I wasn't really into it anymore.
[57:50.81]That doesn't mean I'm not gonna get back into it at some point.
[57:59.46]Who knows?
[58:10.35]But when I was writing it, I was really into it.
[58:13.37]And it was making me laugh, I was like having fun.
[58:18.76]That guy just got like stuck.
[58:24.29]Holy shit.
[58:27.13]God.
[58:36.89]Other things to priority.
[58:38.06]Let's just put it that way.
[58:49.12]Oh, I thought that was my health missing.
[59:08.05]Where are you and what room are you in and where are you shooting from?
[59:10.93]I want all three of those questions answered Keep them off That was just so we could get on the cart longer without anybody attacking us
[59:42.39]Charge, do it.
[59:43.05]You know you want to.
[59:53.05]Shit.
[59:57.87]Where'd you go?
[60:07.04]They're all out there again?
[60:13.64]Already?
[60:14.22]I haven't even got my afternoon snack.
[60:22.31]Oh, he got me.
[60:27.93]But it didn't matter.
[60:28.63]We're going to get you a Jeremiah Brand cereal?
[60:35.20]Is that what somebody wrote?
[60:36.78]Or am I filling in the blanks?
[60:43.59]Just keep it rolling.
[60:50.62]Tell us a bedtime story.
[60:53.06]Once upon a time there was a prince.
[60:55.76]The prince had warts all over his body.
[60:58.62]And he needed to... He really needed to find a special ointment to make sure his warts weren't still there after like a week.
[61:08.21]So he went to the doctor and the doctor turned out to be a princess.
[61:12.00]And he's like, I could use some wort cream.
[61:14.98]She's like, oh, but my father will never allow this.
[61:17.56]And he's like, allow what?
[61:18.34]I just want some cream.
[61:20.18]She's like, oh, well, okay, sure.
[61:21.48]Here's some wort cream.
[61:23.08]And he took it and the warts went away.
[61:24.30]But the side effect was he died within two weeks because it was an awful medicine they should never have been taking.
[61:29.06]There you go.
[61:32.11]That guy exploded.
[61:54.45]Wow, he just got pulled in a really weird spot.
[61:57.81]We actually won this game.
[62:00.26]We did it!
