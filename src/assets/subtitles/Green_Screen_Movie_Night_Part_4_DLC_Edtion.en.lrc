[00:01.87]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04.08]It is time for DLC Crack Night.
[00:10.98]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:13.94]Well, it's not really night yet, but it will be when it's over.
[00:20.55]This is a... We might be in for a long one.
[00:23.65]At least longer than you've been used to recently.
[00:28.61]There are...
[00:33.30]258 videos on this stream today.
[00:37.02]Maybe I- Alright, listen.
[00:39.28]If we get, like, five hours into this, and, like, I can't take it anymore, like, I might get hurt.
[00:46.15]If I start- If I laugh too hard, I'm gonna get- I'm probably gonna get hurt.
[00:50.11]So, we're gonna go into this very, very much with... We'll see.
[00:56.54]But there are six and a half hours of videos.
[01:00.18]And that has been shaved...
[01:04.88]There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions.
[01:12.16]I actually was probably going to talk to the mods here and see if we could maybe, like we did last time, do like an extended edition.
[01:23.03]Where maybe we could have... Oh, here's like the... Here's the extended cut with like another extra 300 videos or like 200 videos or something.
[01:30.73]I think we did something like that last time, so...
[01:34.70]But for the stream purposes, there are just over six and a half hours of videos.
[01:39.42]Just about six and a half hours.
[01:42.18]And that's without any pauses in between.
[01:45.41]That's another thing we have to keep in mind.
[01:47.89]So it's six and a half straight hours of video content.
[01:53.07]Hurry up.
[01:53.63]Hurry up.
[01:54.81]I'm not just gonna... No, I've been waiting for this for a long time.
[01:59.42]And I haven't seen really any of these.
[02:02.68]I'm looking forward to it.
[02:04.34]People gotta trickle in, man.
[02:05.34]You don't want to just start the movie before everyone gets in.
[02:10.02]You gotta have the previews first.
[02:11.20]Now this is all you got.
[02:13.46]It's me talking to you for a preview.
[02:16.28]When you go to the movie theater, the movie doesn't just start at 7.30.
[02:19.08]The movie starts at like 7.55.
[02:21.78]It does.
[02:26.33]No, it doesn't.
[02:27.45]What do you mean it does?
[02:29.71]At 7.30, the previews start for like 20 minutes.
[02:33.32]And then you have to watch the same AMC movie theater commercial where the Coca-Cola fills up the cup really fast.
[02:41.12]And it fizzes all over the place.
[02:42.73]And it's a fucking large.
[02:44.19]And they give it to this guy that's like 5'6".
[02:47.41]My size.
[02:48.03]5'7", 5'8".
[02:48.33]And is he supposed to drink that whole thing?
[02:51.19]No.
[02:53.75]They get this huge thing of popcorn.
[02:55.59]Nobody eats a jumbo popcorn.
[02:58.43]They eat the top half, or they eat the top third of it.
[03:01.63]And then they look sad and they go, fuck, I shouldn't have got a big one.
[03:04.99]And then what?
[03:05.39]What do you think happens to it?
[03:08.83]That's why... Did I ever tell you the time that Burger Boy brought in to the movie theater a bag of double cheeseburgers and ate them like popcorn?
[03:16.53]Did I ever tell you that story?
[03:20.93]I did, right?
[03:21.91]Yeah.
[03:24.53]For those who have don't know burger boy went we went to the movie theaters and he brought with him It was his popcorn his movie snack was a bag of probably six or seven mcdoubles And that's what he ate for the movie Like it was popcorn And if you think about like okay see he was taking the wrappers and he was like putting the wrappers in the bag and
[03:52.67]And then at the very end, he squished it down to this tiny little, just small in your fist, bag of waste.
[03:58.89]And he threw it in the trash.
[04:02.44]Like, fuck all this bullshit with, like, get a large popcorn and dump the popcorn in the trash in this big, like, cardboard bucket.
[04:10.12]Burger Boy was being environmentally friendly.
[04:17.40]But yeah, he did eat seven McDoubles over the course of about two hours.
[04:24.56]That's based.
[04:25.64]He's a king.
[04:28.84]No, he's still just a boy.
[04:32.22]He's not Burger King.
[04:34.04]That would be copyright infringement.
[04:36.46]He's just a boy.
[04:38.64]Don't forget that.
[04:42.58]He can't be Burger King.
[04:46.06]One of those already exists.
[04:49.82]He can be King Burger.
[04:51.66]Ha ha ha ha.
[04:56.72]is a sellout.
[04:57.70]What?
[05:01.53]Fuck the king.
[05:03.17]Excuse me.
[05:04.89]Favor the king.
[05:06.07]Please.
[05:07.27]Get it right.
[05:07.97]It's been rebranded.
[05:13.21]Anyways, we're gonna get started.
[05:14.21]There's lots of videos.
[05:16.85]I'm looking forward to it.
[05:20.01]I have a playlist.
[05:20.77]It's just gonna play.
[05:21.65]I'm gonna pause it.
[05:22.99]It depends on what it is.
[05:25.13]Here we go.
[05:25.59]You guys ready?
[05:27.71]Are you ready to do this?
[05:33.46]Here, I have to prove that I exist like once every three or four years, every three or four weeks.
[05:40.82]I exist.
[05:42.89]One thing that I have noticed about these videos, it's kind of funny in its own way, is this green screen footage was taken at the absolute pinnacle, the absolute pinnacle
[05:56.58]heart the absolute in the middle of the quarantine and my skin is like transparent white hadn't been outside in probably fucking seven or eight weeks I have lost a little bit of weight since being on this medical problem and I had this quarantine haircut
[06:21.18]And I look fucking crazy.
[06:23.64]I look- Let's just be real.
[06:24.78]Let's be honest with everybody.
[06:26.26]I gotta be honest with you.
[06:27.62]Since then, I've put on another couple pounds.
[06:29.64]I've been alright.
[06:30.64]I've been trying to treat some of these issues.
[06:34.48]I look really fucking crazy.
[06:36.22]But it works in a way because then you can use it for whatever- You wanna- Hey, you want a crazy guy in your fucking YouTube video?
[06:43.23]I got DLC for ya.
[06:45.05]There's plenty of it.
[06:47.69]You look scary.
[06:52.24]quarantine haircut like my haircut was like long on this side short on this side like puffed up like this I like made my face look like it's skinny I had like a pale white face from not being outside and like eight weeks I lost weight from the fucking medical shit
[07:11.14]And I didn't even really, guys, I have not looked at really any footage until like very recently.
[07:16.36]I looked at a couple things really early on, but I didn't really grasp how crazed I actually looked in a lot of these clips.
[07:26.03]Start the movie.
[07:30.67]The fucking previews, alright?
[07:32.61]Don't talk during the previews.
[07:34.06]Turn your phone off, guy.
[07:35.28]You're talking during the preview.
[07:38.62]I'm the preview.
[07:40.39]None of you should be talking.
[07:41.79]I'm the preview.
[07:43.55]You're at the movie theater right now.
[07:45.48]You're watching.
[07:46.22]I'm the preview.
[07:46.98]Stop talking and turn your phone off now.
[07:52.42]That's what they should do.
[07:54.58]Forget about, fuck the Coke.
[07:55.96]Let's go get a snack in the kitchen.
[07:58.24]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:59.12]Have me.
[08:00.26]I'll go full screen.
[08:01.42]Have me say, hello, everybody.
[08:03.86]Welcome to the movie.
[08:05.30]Shut up.
[08:05.90]Shut up.
[08:06.38]And like point around.
[08:07.22]Hey, you in the back.
[08:08.96]Shut up.
[08:10.27]Turn off that phone right now, motherfucker.
[08:14.27]And I do, it's 20 minutes before a movie starts.
[08:17.49]Have me be so irritating that I piss everybody off for them to either leave the movie theater or turn their phone off.
[08:23.21]I'll be like, turn off your phone.
[08:25.11]Turn off your fucking phone.
[08:26.67]You're all assholes.
[08:28.01]Like I'll do, it'll be 20 straight minutes.
[08:30.31]And then it'll be like, God, like fine.
[08:32.99]Jesus, man.
[08:33.87]Shut the fuck up.
[08:36.11]Or they'll leave.
[08:37.45]And we got their money anyways.
[08:39.91]Right, folks?
[08:43.09]I just gave 10 subs.
[08:49.30]They'll specifically keep the phone on.
[08:50.78]No, they won't.
[08:51.26]Because if a phone notification sound is played, there'll be microphones around every... By the way, there'll be microphones at every seat.
[09:00.79]You'll lean in and go...
[09:03.11]Hey, what just happened?
[09:03.87]I went to the bathroom.
[09:05.41]Like, I pop up on the screen.

[09:08.96]Seat 21B!
[09:10.50]Talking during the movie!
[09:11.88]Talking!
[09:14.60]And then everyone will know.
[09:15.66]They'll go... What if you fart?
[09:27.32]You hear like a...
[09:30.73]Oh, excuse me, in seat 1A, we've got a farter here.
[09:34.89]We've got a farter in 1A.

[10:52.30]Alright, you guys ready to fucking go?
[10:57.18]Go.
[11:01.77]I'm stalling because I want people to be here, alright?

[16:18.36]That's Slimer with the hot dogs in his mouth.
[16:21.86]I bought it for $500, but I thought it was going to keep appreciating, and it didn't.
[16:25.32]It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400.
[16:27.06]Oh, my gosh.
[16:30.80]Wait, what?

[16:51.92]It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400.
[16:55.81]In reality, it's worth about 20.
[16:58.23]It's worth 20.
[16:58.75]Okay, this next one is called, uh, Once in a Lifetime, Jerma Edit.
[17:10.86]Oh, I have to make the- I gotta make this really clear.

[17:39.78]Well, maybe you haven't even heard the song yet.
[17:41.06]I'm just saying.
[17:41.58]I got to make this clear.
[17:42.50]I got to give the warning right now that like, I don't know.
[17:45.34]I have no idea what's in it.
[17:46.16]I don't know what's in here.
[17:47.80]This is new to me too.
[17:49.96]I can't wait to get like season eight of The Walking Dead spoiled for me.

[18:26.62]Here it comes.

[18:58.29]VOD's fucked, the VOD's fucked in all of these!
[19:19.96]Is this the music video shot for shot?

[20:17.08]Wait, what?
[20:19.90]He killed me?
[20:20.80]I've been looking forward to this.
[20:26.20]My powers have doubled since the last time we met Count.
[20:29.80]Does his son...
[20:32.20]Bring your idiot kid to work day.
[20:35.18]Right.

[21:30.03]Why has he killed me?
[21:30.97]Am I supposed to be dead?
[21:53.15]I'm so glad somebody used this.
[21:56.93]It's so stupid.
[21:59.05]Why would your lightsaber do that?
[22:02.11]Was it an ice cream cone?
[22:04.44]Why are lightsabers as easy to fall off as like a one scoop ice cream?
[22:11.84]Oh my god, that was fucking hilarious.
[22:17.44]Okay.

[23:24.92]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[23:28.70]It's pretty good
[24:33.51]Hitting those notes, yeah.
[24:37.32]This is like when somebody does a, hey, I did this theme song with like 10 of me doing different instruments and beatboxing.
[24:42.86]Except I didn't do any of this.
[24:46.04]Somebody else did.
[24:55.59]I made a couple of strange noises.
[25:02.35]That was awesome.
[25:04.37]I loved it.
[25:07.45]Look, and let me tell you something.
[25:09.31]Look at this.
[25:10.05]Look at this shit.

[58:29.44]This is a new way to play this game.
[58:31.70]Is it broken?
[58:32.98]Can you just even look and say it's broken?
[58:40.26]Okay, we had a bunch of subs, but I just... You guys are finding such great places to put this shit.
[58:46.96]It's hilarious.
[58:48.18]I'm so glad.
[58:51.29]We have 50 community subs from Freddy Dread.
[58:53.09]Freddy, thanks for the 50 subs.
[58:54.31]Holy shit.
[58:55.95]It's like 50 subs a day from Freddy.
[58:58.75]Freddy Dread gives like 50 to 100 subs.
[59:01.13]Like every other stream.
[59:02.55]It's ridiculous.
[59:03.53]I can't... I could pay for like a house with the amount of money that Freddy Dread has given me.
[59:14.72]Thank you for the 50 community subs, Freddie Dredden.
[59:16.62]Thanks for the house, too.
[59:18.52]I might as well say, hey, thanks for the house.
[59:24.73]Go buy a house.
[59:25.73]Buy a house.
[59:29.89]Thanks, Freddie.
[59:30.49]It's crazy what you're doing, and it's completely unnecessary.
[59:33.57]Just know what you're doing.
[59:34.67]You don't have to do it.
[59:36.07]You really don't.
[59:37.03]It's a lot of money, man.
[59:38.59]It's a crazy amount of money.
[59:40.61]I can't wait to buy you a nice steak dinner at Denny's.
[59:44.96]That's right.
[59:45.38]You get to order off the dinner menu, not the breakfast lunch menu.
[59:51.56]But 50 subs.
[59:52.20]We had five from Ajax, the mediocre.
[59:54.28]Ten from Captain Squiggly.
[59:57.17]Thanks, both of you.
[59:57.79]Five from Ferd and five from Morning Maple.
[60:00.21]Thanks, you guys.
[60:01.73]All of you for subbing the fucking channel.
[60:05.93]Let's keep going.
[60:07.09]Thank you, all of you.
[60:07.97]It's crazy amounts of money to give anybody.
[60:09.85]You don't have to do that for me.
[60:11.05]You don't have to.
[60:12.77]You don't.
[60:16.31]Ready?
[60:21.55]What is your name?
[60:22.69]Jerma985, look me up.
[60:23.64]Are you excited to be here?
[60:25.34]That's pretty good.
[60:26.50]What are you going to say?
[60:28.84]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[60:31.10]Really?
[60:33.62]You believe that you can win?
[60:35.04]You and me, I know we're going to do it.
[60:37.14]We and you are going to do this.
[60:39.96]Yeah, okay.
[60:42.56]The stage is yours.
[60:43.93]Good luck.
[60:45.05]I've wanted to do this for a very long time.
[60:46.53]I can't.
[60:48.42]This feels great.
[60:49.12]I can do this.
[60:52.66]And I can do this.
[60:57.26]No, no, no.
[60:58.88]It's alright.
[60:59.42]It's alright.
[61:02.60]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[61:06.60]Ah.
[61:10.58]Ah.
[61:12.57]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[61:14.89]Ah.
[61:15.03]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[61:23.36]Ah.
[61:23.68]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[61:31.16]Ha.
[61:31.34]Dun.
[61:31.48]Ah.
[61:49.37]I think you are a living, beautiful, walking miracle.
[62:05.28]But people not knowing your name is so right and so wrong because I think the world is going to know your name.
[62:13.07]I think right now they're going to know your name.
[62:21.06]What?
[62:21.58]Oh, okay.
[62:23.14]What happened?
[62:31.13]That was absurd.
[62:34.29]The point right into the camera, that was good.
[62:37.89]Oh, what a psycho.
[62:43.13]Okay, this is Psychotronic Jerma.
[62:47.55]It was the live button.
[62:49.60]Oh.
[62:52.10]Psychotronic Jerma.
[62:56.01]Okay, to the roof.
[63:27.60]Bunker ass.
[63:34.50]Bunker ass.
[63:37.30]That's the one.
[63:37.88]No.
[63:39.80]You ain't gonna get anything out of me.
[63:59.79]Didn't we just see this one with the Nickelodeon clip?
[64:01.81]Woo, up in the smoke!
[64:23.72]I was skewed.
[64:25.79]I was skewed.
[64:26.47]I almost did it.
[64:28.84]I have no fucking idea, man.
[64:31.06]Don't ask me.
[64:31.70]I have no idea what that was, but it doesn't matter.
[64:38.16]Metal Gear Solid.
[64:39.69]Metal Gear.
[64:40.95]Here we go.
[64:48.27]Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.
[64:51.94]Fucking idiot.
[64:53.28]I gotta go.
[65:10.74]Why do they wear jeans?
[65:29.37]Jerma, look out.
[65:31.13]There's a tank up ahead.
[65:32.91]You're probably wondering who I am.
[65:35.11]Let's just say I'm your biggest fan.
[65:37.23]Smile.
[65:41.89]The backseater.
[65:46.24]Levi gives shit.
[65:51.83]Come.
[65:52.87]Let's fight.
[65:54.99]Good game.

[66:20.14]Honey?
[66:22.70]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[66:27.00]Welcome to my strata.
[66:30.02]Are you in charge of this?
[66:31.72]Turn it off.
[66:33.46]You have to shut this off.
[66:34.46]Shut it off.
[66:42.50]Okay, uh, this is Jerma985the3rd.
[66:45.65]Body Rock.
[67:12.39]Haha Hey
[68:00.56]That was great.
[68:03.76]I loved it.
[68:04.28]It was amazing.
[68:06.76]A lot of work went into that one.
[68:07.84]That was a lot of editing.
[68:11.61]Jerma Celery Man.
[68:14.29]If you don't know who this is, this is from Paul Rudd.
[68:18.15]He was on Tim and Eric's Awesome Show, which is required reading for this stream, by the way.
[68:25.25]So is Steve Brill.
[68:27.81]Here we go.
[68:31.69]Good morning, Paul.
[68:33.37]What will your first sequence of the day be?
[68:35.59]Computer load up, celery man, please.
[68:37.59]Yes, Paul.
[68:39.07]Could you kick up the, uh, 43d3d3?

[69:30.26]Wait, wait, why are you kicking me out of the server?
[69:33.32]No, no, no.
[69:34.66]I've been voted off.
[69:42.21]The best part about the title here is law and order.
[69:45.57]Hopefully mute safe.
[69:48.53]If you have to write hopefully mute safe in the title, it's probably not mute safe.
[69:57.23]Here we go.
[70:06.97]It's the intro, okay.
[70:52.80]What is this picture?
[70:53.92]Where did you get that photo?
[70:55.40]Oh, fucking come on, no.
[71:20.75]That was awesome.
[71:25.85]That's a clap.
[71:26.95]That's a clap right there.

[78:00.43]Thanks to modern editing techniques, we can use existing footage to complete the film without Jerma985.
[78:05.93]Watch!
[78:09.61]You see, on this channel, I like to call myself Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jerma, because I have two different sides.

[81:27.33]Hello, and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.
[81:32.98]We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one.
[81:37.48]Your specimen has been processed, and it has been noted as being below average height.
[81:42.98]In the event of a tall shelf, a weighted storage cube will be provided for you to stand on.
[81:49.08]Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all Enrichment Center activities,
[81:57.19]Serious injuries may occur.
[81:59.15]For your own safety, and the safety of others, please refrain from m- What?
[82:03.87]And back.
[82:04.13]The portal will open in 3... 2... 1...
[83:19.89]Fucking weirdo.
[83:23.55]Congratulations.
[83:24.95]The test is now over.
[83:26.41]All aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees Kelvin and ice cream are on its way.
[83:35.30]Goodbye.
[83:36.98]I just die.
[83:42.08]Wait, so I just die.
[83:49.86]Oh.
[83:49.94]Well, that's unfortunate.
[83:54.69]Uh, coming up next is Jerma Dances' Till We're All Dead.
[83:57.63]What's the name of the song?
[84:00.88]Okay, the song is called Till We're All Dead.
[84:51.54]This is pretty good.
[84:52.56]This is pretty good.
[85:17.29]Bard.
[85:18.67]I can't fix the Bard.
[85:20.19]It's destroyed.
[85:22.59]And I feel like I'm doing that thing where I'm leaning really close into your ear at any... Oh, the music stopped.
[85:27.39]Good, I can talk to you.
[85:31.42]Shit!
[85:32.38]Spring's over.
[85:33.74]It's not, though.
[85:34.16]It's still going.
[85:36.34]I was doing the thing where I was leaning into your ear at the party or at the bar, desperately trying to communicate with you.
[85:45.21]And if the bar or club or whatever, if they had just turned the music down by even 25%, there's nothing I hate more than not being able to talk to anybody I'm out with or that I'm doing anything with.
[85:56.71]It sucks.
[85:57.28]It's stupid.
[85:58.06]I don't understand it.
[86:01.44]If I have to yell over a vacuum cleaner to talk to you, I don't want to go there.
[86:06.58]Just turn the fuck, turn the music down.
[86:09.02]Just a little.
[86:09.75]Turn it down.
[86:11.43]Turn that music down now.
[86:18.00]The creature runs into a glass door in a French bakery program.
[86:22.08]What?
[86:22.34]What?
[86:24.17]Guillermo rides the spinny chair.
[86:45.30]Get him off get him off I'm gonna die
[87:19.20]Gerba strikes again.
[87:21.40]No more heroes.
[87:28.03]They fixed all the kind of annoying bullshit that is in this game.
[87:32.09]But I still think this game's really good.
[87:34.03]I still like this one.
[87:38.07]Alright, here we go.
[87:40.66]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[87:42.36]What the fuck?
[87:45.32]Drink nine?

[89:38.07]Alright.
[89:38.79]The musical man.
[89:48.52]Excuse me.
[89:51.67]Can we be quiet, please?
[89:54.53]Some of us are trying to sleep.
[90:03.27]No, no, no.
[90:32.43]They are objects of flight.
[90:34.22]They right there come.
[90:35.58]I almost feel like time is just disintegrating.
[90:40.48]Where can I go?
[90:41.18]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[90:46.04]I can't put it down.
[90:46.86]There's a circle of people.
[90:48.72]Hey, this is fun.
[90:50.02]I'm stirring the maze.
[90:52.38]A hundred gecks?
[91:19.57]Just give me a minute.
[91:20.47]I'm kind of winded.
[91:22.13]You can probably imagine.
[91:26.99]I gotta get some water.
[91:27.71]I'll be back.
[91:33.11]That was great.
[91:35.16]Good.
[91:36.92]I'll get some water.
[91:37.60]I have a woman.
[91:38.46]It's right in front of me.
[91:43.72]Okay, hold on.
[91:44.86]This is from the movie Hereditary.
[91:47.48]Alright, okay.
[91:48.48]Thank you.
[91:51.09]I really appreciate that.
[92:00.26]I'm going to leave this on the screen for five seconds.
[92:05.85]Wow.
[92:06.79]Thank you for this.
[92:07.87]I've seen this movie.
[92:08.67]If you haven't, you know what's happening.
[92:10.71]You know what's about to happen.
[92:11.51]I'm just trying to warn you right now.
[92:16.83]Okay.
[92:18.11]I haven't seen it.
[92:19.07]Just come back in two minutes and 20.
[92:20.95]Come back in three minutes.
[92:22.14]I'm trying to give you an opportunity.
[92:23.70]Here's the opportunity right now.
[92:24.60]Just take it.
[92:25.06]If you haven't seen it, take it, please.
[92:26.18]I don't want to ruin movies for you.
[92:31.92]Three, two, one.
[92:35.76]Go.
[92:57.78]You okay, man?
[93:02.49]What?
[93:04.27]Is there something on your mind?
[93:07.51]I don't think it's possible.
[93:11.36]Just seems like there might be something you want to say.
[93:15.98]Yeah.
[93:16.80]Oh, I had a long day at work!
[93:17.98]I got fired.
[93:27.63]Well, I mean, it's kind of insane.
[93:29.53]Son? Son? Son?
[93:42.00]Just say it. Just fucking say it!
[93:45.00]Let me tell you something. If you can do not do it diplomically then you shouldn't be doing it at all.
[93:56.65]Did you, you punched him?
[93:57.75]You punched him in the face?
[93:59.71]My son doesn't do that.
[94:01.63]Diplomacy only.
[94:04.11]You know how much trouble I could get in?
[94:06.24]I'm in the, I'm in the gosh darn, whew, I'm getting heated here.
[94:12.56]My son, a United States representative.
[94:18.10]That's your, I'm your dad.
[94:19.68]Yeah, I'm the representative, not you.
[94:21.32]That would be strange now, wouldn't it?
[94:24.24]You gotta do things diplomatically, or you're ground, no, you know what?
[94:26.95]I said, stop right now.
[94:28.29]I'll handle it.
[94:29.59]You are grounded.
[94:31.31]You're grounded.
[94:32.65]We don't fight in this family.
[94:36.52]Eat your gosh darn, I keep saying that stuff and I don't want to.
[94:59.50]Down to business.
[95:00.88]We gotta go to Grandma's house.
[95:06.05]Wait, what?
[95:09.95]What?
[95:24.10]Okay, alright, alright.
[95:26.42]That was fucking great.

[95:33.94]Thank you, Burmeeloop, for the five fucking subs.
[95:40.66]Taunt demonstration, the Boston Breakdance.

[95:53.31]Wait, is this a real... Wait, is this actually in TF2?
[96:02.92]It is?
[96:06.52]When do they put that in?
[96:07.38]Here we go, this one's called Jerma Tetris.
[96:20.93]Uh, by the way, this is a real game.
[96:27.33]okay so this is this is a playable game
[96:54.30]And I'm going to play... There are, I think, three games that people have made.
[96:59.52]And I'm going to play all three of them.
[97:02.18]I'm not going to play them today.
[97:03.16]We're going to open with that when I come back next time.
[97:07.17]Because I want to be able to play them and not just skip through them real quick.
[97:11.39]So we're going to play all three of the Jerma mod games.
[97:16.57]Some of them are mods, some of them are not.
[97:19.33]It's malware.
[97:20.63]Hey, they've been scanned.
[97:21.87]Okay?
[97:22.33]Okay.
[97:27.54]They've been scanned.
[97:31.74]But that's going to be fun.
[97:33.22]And that's awesome.
[97:34.30]I can't wait.
[97:38.32]Exploded Hornets Entry 1.
[97:39.96]Don't know what this is.
[97:48.63]The Jerm had disappeared.
[97:49.39]I needed to find out what had happened.
[97:53.17]I managed to find these tapes of the last video he recorded.
[97:55.37]I tried to piece them together the best I could.
[97:57.59]Marble Hornets... What's Marble Hornets?
[98:01.01]Marble Hornets spoiler.
[98:02.03]Is that a show?

[98:47.52]I feel like I need like a fire behind me.
[98:48.86]You know what I mean?
[98:51.51]Wouldn't that be better if there was like a fucking fire right here?
[98:56.03]Wait, wait, hold on a second.

[116:26.39]Have you seen the size of my arms?
[116:29.91]What was that?
[116:32.39]I thought you were somebody else that I knew.
[116:35.97]Dancing in September.
[116:37.84]Oh, you want to fight?
[116:38.34]You want to fight?
[116:39.50]Okay.
[116:40.00]Oh, it's already dark!
[116:47.43]You.
[116:48.01]A big F for fuck you for controversially making fun of me.
[116:54.62]Ow.
[117:01.41]Hold on, hold on.
[117:02.01]Wait, wait, wait.
[117:03.22]I need to address this on stream again.
[117:05.56]Because, listen, did I eat any tomatoes last night?
[117:08.38]So this is the virtual world.
[117:10.12]And am I going to have any oranges today?
[117:12.24]This is what happens when you do too many drugs.
[117:13.92]I'm in the middle of a check.
[117:15.50]That's all I hear.
[117:16.08]That's all I hear.
[117:17.54]Shut up.
[117:19.10]Shut up.
[117:20.82]I, like, don't care about Sonic the Hedgehog anymore.
[117:25.59]I didn't want to knock you out, but I didn't.
[117:28.37]I'm on crack.
[117:29.19]Like, I'm on crack today.
[117:30.83]I don't know what's going on here.
[117:33.97]It's crack.
[117:35.99]That's a little too high for me.
[117:37.07]Let's fuck this up.
[117:40.05]Come on.
[117:43.26]One chicken, please!
[117:45.50]That'll be two dollars.
[117:48.00]Those cost way, way less than that.
[117:51.20]I have ten of those.
[117:53.30]Only a few of these left in existence.
[117:55.76]I'm certain of that.
[117:58.09]And I'm giving it to you.
[117:59.67]Okay, I don't know what that is, but are you sure, son?
[118:02.91]Thank you so much.
[118:04.29]Here, take it.
[118:05.89]Thanks.
[118:06.21]I gotta go.
[118:06.53]Excuse me.
[118:13.56]Yeet.
[118:15.68]That's you up there.
[118:18.04]You're going down.
[118:19.26]I'll make sure to change into my super flying jet monster.
[118:22.78]Jet monster activate.
[118:27.42]Did anybody use this for an actual monster or is it just gonna be me on the green screen?
[118:52.76]Jerma, nice to meet you.
[118:53.90]And don't forget about me, the newest tyrant, Socrates.
[118:57.68]I may be small, but I'm compact.
[119:01.56]Are you a tyrant?
[119:02.74]Ow!
[119:03.94]I'm not a tyrant.
[119:05.22]I'm a begging e-clown.
[119:08.57]Accurate.
[119:10.17]Jump!
[119:10.51]I have nothing to do with this.
[119:14.75]What do I have in my pocket?
[119:17.69]This is made for a small person.
[119:22.89]What's up, man?
[119:25.61]Cowabunga, dude.
[119:26.89]Here we go.
[119:33.48]Yes.
[119:34.08]This sucks.
[119:34.88]Oh.
[119:35.38]Okay, that video was awesome.
[119:43.32]But don't you feel like that you just watched that video inside of a dream of you watching that video?
[119:49.98]That was a video you watched in a dream.
[119:55.74]That was crazy.
[119:57.62]There's so much to unpack with that one.
[119:59.49]You could watch that one 10 times since it's a different movie every time.
[120:02.03]Alright, we're going to take a pee break.
[120:04.73]I told, I promised one person.
[120:07.19]They were like, please, dude, I'm going to piss my pants.

[129:39.12]Like, oh, let me just keep that.
[129:40.22]I gotta skip, I gotta fucking run.
[129:41.58]I don't know what that is.
[129:42.96]I have no idea what that is.
[129:44.26]It could be anything.
[129:45.69]I just saw that and go, I don't know what it is.
[129:51.61]Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[129:52.65]Alright, is it called Jerma Sets Up a Tent?
[129:55.89]that was great but how do you get inside yeah it's all crushy looking customization genius he's tenderizing the ground of course write that down write that down
[130:30.60]That was awesome.
[130:31.62]Hey, folks.
[130:32.54]So, as the title of this video states, I have made a Jerma- I made a Jerma keyboard.
[130:38.08]What do you mean a Jerma- What do you mean a keyboard?
[130:44.20]This looks like an incredibly elaborate setup.
[130:48.95]Um, alright.
[130:49.75]I'm intrigued.
[130:51.35]A keyboard.
[130:52.21]But what is a Jerma keyboard, you may be asking?
[130:55.32]Well, I like to think of it as a tool to make live Jerma edited music videos or YouTube poop music videos, if people still call them that.
[131:03.94]Basically, it plays audio and video at the same time through the... So wait a minute.
[131:08.75]This is... Back when Looney Tunes used to have a live orchestra play over their cartoon...
[131:18.02]This is what this is.
[131:23.10]Don't pause, don't pause, hey!
[131:25.44]...or YouTube poop music videos, if people still call them that.
[131:29.16]Basically, it plays audio and video at the same time through the push of a key.
[131:33.59]The main reason the video looks like this is so I can prove that it's not edited video and is actually the keyboard.
[131:39.89]Now, it's not really that robust yet.
[131:41.89]I've only got one song sort of pre-programmed in, but I'm happy with where it's at, and I figured that I would show it off.
[131:48.68]First, let's go over real quick how it works.
[131:51.84]We got my keyboard connected via MIDI cable to my interface, which sends information to both Pro Tools and my program.
[131:58.54]Audio from Pro Tools is going out to my looper, but only to put effects on as I see fit, and that audio is being recorded elsewhere.
[132:05.99]This dude's got a looper.
[132:06.83]Now let's talk about the function of each of these keys.
[132:09.81]Up here is my pre-programmed song, where I've got kick, clap, chords, beeps, bass, and most importantly, sneezes!
[132:16.58]Each of these trigger a loop when they're pressed.
[132:19.06]All of these pressed in time together form the full song, during which I can drop out parts as I please.
[132:24.74]Also, I can give Jerma fancy backing lights using these two guys, wow!
[132:29.34]Now these keys are the real fun stuff.
[132:31.44]Each of them correspond to a particular drama clip from his most recent green screen stream, edited to match the tempo of the song.
[132:38.62]Each of them are sensitive to the duration of the key press, so clips can be cut short if you need, and there is no limitation as to how many can be pressed at once, so you can go WILD!
[132:49.22]And lastly, down here is the more straight-up keyboard with two octaves of Jerma goodness, featuring five bassier notes with an extra octave down and a toggle-able keyboard visual.
[132:59.99]Why am I like a canned gravy?
[133:01.47]Basically, here you can play whatever you want or solo over the built-in song, which I am not good at.
[133:06.89]Also, the Jermas down here can get a little sticky for some reason.
[133:09.99]I'm not sure why, and I figured that I would tell you.
[133:12.99]Now, with all that in mind, let's take it for a spin.
[133:31.70]This is gonna be crazy.
[134:08.16]I have a job interview in 10 minutes.
[134:14.03]I'll delete that one too.
[134:17.25]I'll delete that one too.
[134:19.47]Quit it.
[134:20.39]Quit it.
[134:21.07]I have a job interview in 10 minutes.
[134:26.02]That's a good interview.
[134:29.20]Shit.
[134:29.68]Shit.
[134:30.38]Shit.
[134:35.38]Die you motherfucker. D- d- d- die.
[134:40.38]D- d- d- d- die.
[134:45.38]Excuse me.
[135:00.08]Uh-oh.
[135:01.08]It's going into overdrive.
[135:23.20]Oh, I missed it.
[135:23.58]So there you have it, folks, the Jerma keyboard.
[135:25.40]I missed it.
[135:26.15]This was a real challenge to make, but I had a lot of fun with it, so I hope you did too.
[135:30.51]Also, I would love to keep improving it, so if you have any suggestions for features or even different people I could make keyboards out of, feel free to tell me in the comments.
[135:39.19]Also, also, I'll probably upload a cleaner version of the visuals since this looks kind of bad.
[135:46.62]Also, also, also, this project kind of got away from me, so here are some keyboard renders I made for no reason.
[135:52.23]Look at them go.
[135:52.95]Whee!
[135:53.61]Okay, thanks for watching.
[135:54.65]Bye!
[135:54.91]Are you selling the keyboard?
[135:57.37]Are you selling the rendered keyboards?
[135:59.53]That's your opportunity to have a link show up on screen of you selling the rendered keyboard, like a direct link.
[136:06.14]I wouldn't be able to stop you.
[136:12.26]Greed!
[136:15.24]Uh, that was... I can't believe that somebody would make this.
[136:26.99]All these tools?
[136:31.53]It's unbelievable.
[136:35.65]Jeremy ends the germiverse.
[136:37.65]Wait, didn't we see this one?
[136:44.14]Did we see this one?
[136:46.30]No, no, no, no, no.

[136:50.18]This is important because there's a lot of people here.

[150:53.10]It sure does look beautiful.
[150:54.82]Anyways, I gotta hurry up and get to a cut before I blow my staff.
[151:08.57]Welcome back everybody.
[151:11.51]Guess where I am?
[151:13.80]That's right, on vacation.
[151:16.31]Take a look.
[151:18.31]I never get to go out in places like this.
[151:21.11]It's so much fun for me.
[151:22.83]And before the video gets started, if you could please give me a thumbs up for being on vacation.
[151:27.91]Well, you're not on vacation.
[151:29.79]I'm doing all this cool, fun shit, and you're not.
[151:32.09]And I'm going to continue to do all kinds of really cool shit, and you're just going to watch me do cool shit.
[151:38.38]And give me money to do it, too.
[151:39.58]And I'm going to fly around the entire world.
[151:40.92]And I'm going to do a bunch of cool shit.
[151:42.90]Hey, you and me, we're friends.
[151:46.11]It's a palm tree.
[151:46.97]Can you believe it?
[151:52.49]I'm scared of the guy that was just on camera.
[151:55.55]I did it.
[151:56.11]It was me.
[151:56.59]What an actor.
[151:59.53]Okay, this is Lonely Rolling Jerma?
[152:08.85]We have the Metroid, Goblin, and Mayor?
[152:14.65]Lonely rolling Jerma.
[152:16.50]Here we go.
[152:17.12]Three, two, one.
[152:19.84]Hey, man.
[152:26.78]Welcome to the stream.
[152:27.98]My name's Jerma.
[152:28.80]Nice to meet you.
[152:29.50]Right there.
[152:29.92]Bingo.
[152:30.48]Right there.
[152:30.76]That's the follow button.
[152:31.80]Click that.
[152:33.09]Every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.
[152:35.89]And I do lots of fun.
[153:20.77]Of course I do!
[153:22.19]Is this on the Jerma keyboard?
[154:01.18]It's the actual fucking lyrics of the song!
[154:35.00]I cannot believe you took the time to make a person that doesn't speak Japanese to make me sing that whole song in Japanese by pulling out just consonants and vowels that I've said.
[154:53.13]What on Earth?
[154:57.32]At first, I was trying to figure, I was like, are these lyrics, or is it just the tune of the song?
[155:02.55]And then when it became clear that they made me, they Frankensteined me speaking Japanese.
[155:09.93]That was insane.
[155:10.87]Alright, this is a project.
[155:17.93]This project wouldn't have been made without other people's help.
[155:20.15]This is also a video game, by the way.
[155:24.77]This is a Steam Workshop mod for Rivals of Aether.
[155:29.57]And this is another one that I could play.
[155:33.01]And apparently they've added something.
[155:35.31]Somebody modded something in or something.
[155:38.18]I don't know what it is.
[155:38.90]We're going to find out right now.
[155:44.30]I may be small, but I sure got lots of power.
[156:25.93]You have to gain viewers, that's how I get power?
[156:28.41]If I lose viewers, I lose power.
[156:52.11]Oath to Power Jetscape, multiple tiers.
[156:55.49]What?
[156:56.23]You crashed my mid-range PC when you did it.
[157:05.34]Alright, well be careful.
[157:06.38]Up, Specialist of Raptor.

[158:06.79]I can't wait to play it.
[158:07.43]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[158:18.44]Okay.
[158:22.50]Uh... I... I can't... I'm gonna play all these, by the way.
[158:27.16]That's how we're gonna open the stream when I come back after the weekend here.
[158:32.96]So, any game that you see, they're gonna be played for like a- I wanna play for them for like an hour.
[158:38.58]I wanna go through this.
[158:39.24]I think there's at least three of them, so.
[158:41.05]At least.
[158:43.15]Alright, I destroy the Westminster Agility Championship.
[158:45.89]Three, two, one.
[158:47.95]Gabby just can't wait to go.
[158:50.05]Not leaving, not leaving.
[158:52.74]Look at this dog walk.
[158:55.22]Whoa, what speed on that dog walk.
[158:57.14]Redirects a little bit, make sure they get that.
[158:59.00]Push, push, push.
[159:00.64]Into that tunnel.
[159:01.82]Nice job.
[159:03.14]Get to the backside of this jump.
[159:05.32]Andrea, hang in there.
[159:06.80]Maybe she might have got lost for a quick second.
[159:10.12]Gabby has to be 43.20.
[159:12.60]No, that's fine.
[159:13.58]It's just time.
[159:14.26]That's time.
[159:14.80]It's just time.
[159:16.38]Wow.
[159:16.64]We're taking the long way around everything, it looks like.
[159:21.97]But this is a young, young dog.
[159:23.53]Through the weave post.
[159:25.81]Motors.
[159:27.67]Motors.
[159:28.53]Look at those weaves.
[159:38.01]He's a young dog.
[159:39.33]35 this year.
[159:42.90]That was very well made.
[159:46.66]You know how annoying it is to do even one of those cuts?
[159:52.56]Forget about 55 of them in a row.
[159:57.02]The tunnel was the best part.
[159:57.86]Yeah, I agree.
[159:59.59]Alright, this is Jerma Heaven Custom Remix.
[160:00.89]You're the rats.
[160:02.19]Hi, hey.
[160:03.09]Hi, how are you?
[160:03.81]How you doing?
[160:05.85]Wake up.
[160:08.38]Bye-bye.
[160:38.88]Crazy into you.
[160:39.88]Crazy into you.
[160:40.86]Crazy into you.
[161:32.17]That was incredible.
[161:33.87]That was incredible.
[161:58.43]Something that I think a lot of you guys are starting to become aware of is I couldn't make a video this- You don't understand what I'm saying?
[162:11.48]Like, I couldn't do this.
[162:14.80]Like, so much of this shit is the video after video after video after video after video after video after video even after it being shaved down by a lot of videos
[162:27.26]There's so many.
[162:28.83]You guys all know how to use editing programs really well.
[162:31.37]These aren't like shittily made things.
[162:34.45]These are top tier of tier one shit.
[162:39.93]You starting to become aware of?
[162:41.75]Omega low?
[162:42.45]No, I mean like... I've been aware of this for a long time.
[162:50.85]This is tier one shit.
[162:51.83]This is not like tier five shit.
[162:55.76]That was kind of funny.
[162:57.22]That was kind of good.
[162:59.63]This is unbelievable.
[163:01.11]The song.
[163:01.51]You had to make the song too.
[163:02.41]You had to put the song together.
[163:41.60]That was great.
[163:42.60]That was absolutely remarkable stuff.
[164:06.99]Coming up next.
[164:08.45]Hey!

[164:40.81]Much love, Yumitsu.
[165:07.82]Very true for each stream.
[165:10.13]The never-ending seesaw.
[166:05.90]That just feels good to watch those.
[166:18.91]Will they make another one?
[166:20.85]Are they going to make another Rhythm Heaven?
[166:23.81]I hope they do.
[166:27.22]We need it.
[166:27.94]I need it.
[166:30.32]Yes.
[166:30.96]No.
[166:32.22]Not for the Switch.
[166:32.90]For the Switch?
[166:33.98]There's one on the 3DS.
[166:38.09]I want one on the Switch so bad.
[166:39.65]How many games have you said about Nintendo that you want to have so bad?
[166:42.81]This is a bunch, I think, that should just be there, right?
[166:49.11]Anyways, this is called Germapond.
[167:12.92]one punch Jerma alright this is I think is this the the intro to one punch man I believe this is the intro to one punch man I don't know that's probably not spoilers but just in case just leave if you've ever seen an episode of one punch man quick it's the intro they record themselves like pretending to like
[167:46.59]What?
[168:08.77]So the scenic route.
[168:38.19]Whoa, I know what this one is.
[168:54.40]Um,
[169:05.92]By the way, One Punch Man is a great show.
[169:09.44]What an interesting concept, first of all.
[169:10.94]What an interesting show.
[169:13.66]Based on the comic, based on the manga, right, obviously.
[169:16.00]That's what I mean.
[169:17.54]But what a cool show.
[169:18.12]It's about a guy that punches people.
[169:19.74]And they die in one hit.
[169:22.20]Like, that's one punch guy.
[169:23.82]What a great fucking concept.
[169:25.67]I love it.
[169:26.77]How could you not like that?
[169:27.43]How could you not, like, see the trailer and know, oh, this guy punches people once?
[169:32.57]Just go watch it.
[169:33.32]Just forget, oh, well, I don't know where I could be.
[169:34.88]Just, please, just watch episode two.
[169:37.88]Two of them in a row.
[169:40.08]You guys ever heard of this one?
[169:58.68]Surprised it took this long to get this.
[170:16.63]Bitrate bitrate is yeah, the bitrate went down.
[170:20.71]Why did the bitrate go so low?
[170:22.13]2007 YouTube aesthetic
[170:45.08]Wait, is this JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
[170:48.72]I hope so.
[170:51.71]Here it comes.
[170:55.77]No?
[170:57.75]Oh, I thought that was a... Beastars.
[171:03.36]Beastars?
[171:05.86]Oh, okay.
[171:06.40]Well, this is a Beastars reference.
[171:08.06]Here it comes.
[171:20.68]That looks cool in the background.
[171:21.52]The real one.
[171:21.96]What is that?
[171:50.49]Stop motion animation?
[171:52.47]Zootopia?
[171:53.12]This is not Zootopia.
[172:19.35]The green is like carving into my face.
[172:23.97]I'm like so switched.
[172:27.89]Look at my face.
[172:30.42]On a professional green screen.
[172:34.84]And if I get the damn lighting right.
[172:42.84]Wait, Jerma wins the playoffs with the Vikings.
[172:44.92]Yup.
[172:49.57]That's how you look normally.
[172:55.89]You're the same.
[173:08.91]Keenum's gonna try to work the ball on the boundary.
[173:15.08]Steps into it, passes, caught!
[173:18.98]James!
[173:23.91]Sideline!
[173:24.61]Touchdown!
[173:25.09]Unbelievable!
[173:26.83]He threw it to himself.
[173:28.31]No, no, no.
[173:34.18]But we start with breaking news this noon, as a car fire spreads to two Detroit homes, leaving someone trapped inside one of those houses.
[173:43.13]And that story tops our news this noon.
[173:45.19]It all unfolded in the area of Waveney and Kaju, just north of Mack Avenue, about 9 o'clock this morning.
[173:51.50]And we are learning that a heroic rescue was pulled off by an off-duty Detroit firefighter.
[173:56.36]What, is this real?
[174:00.88]I don't like this one.
[174:04.87]That was real news.
[174:07.49]That was real news.
[174:09.91]That was real news.
[174:10.77]That's real news.
[174:11.91]I don't want to do real news.
[174:14.69]There can't be no real news.
[174:16.65]Happy birthday to you.
[174:19.20]Just want to give you a quick little happy birthday.
[174:22.28]I'm here.
[174:23.36]We wish you the best.
[174:25.62]Although I know I haven't probably seen you in 10 years.
[174:28.36]I made these little videos for you.
[174:32.67]The phone's upside down.
[174:42.24]Real news is real news, and if somebody got hurt or something, I don't want to, like, you know, I don't want to make, like, a joke about somebody actually potentially really getting hurt in real life.
[174:52.29]Right?
[174:52.89]I don't want to... You gotta be careful there.
[174:54.51]I don't want that, you know.
[174:56.83]Star Trek?
[174:57.21]Here comes another Star Trek.
[175:00.52]They were saved and it was fine.
[175:01.68]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[175:02.68]But no real news.
[175:05.97]No real, like, tragic potential events.
[175:11.41]Here comes another Star Trek.
[175:16.57]Someone just got timed out for saying Star Trek.
[175:22.69]What is this?
[175:24.65]Wait, hold on, hold on.
[175:26.03]I know.
[175:26.41]It's probably the face I just did.
[175:30.10]Isn't it?
[175:41.93]I'm not going to show it on stream.
[175:43.03]I don't care.
[175:45.01]I'm not going to show it on stream.
[175:46.72]That's too bad.
[175:48.60]Alright, I'll show it on stream.
[175:51.78]I'm going to show it on stream.
[176:16.31]That looks like somebody is, that looks like your grandfather is laughing so hard at something and he's dying at the same time.
[176:25.26]Like he's watching the, he's watching like the roasts with Jimmy, Jimmy Dean or whatever it is.
[176:34.08]And he's like laughing so hard and he's fucking having a heart attack.
[176:42.65]Dean Martin, Dean Martin, right.
[176:45.12]Not the sausage guy.
[176:47.42]Alright, here we go.
[176:47.88]Jerma Star Trek let's play.
[176:58.31]Send him over there for one set of repairs.
[177:00.19]Now they need him for more.
[177:01.65]Apparently their ship is quite fragile.
[177:18.73]Are you alright?
[177:19.25]Hey, remember me?
[177:23.91]I'm that guy that's supposed to be alive right now for the last two hours.
[177:28.27]Apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair.
[177:32.48]And look at what it looks like now.
[177:33.96]Look at how it looks fucking fine.
[177:35.84]It's fixed.
[177:37.70]We'll use our tractor beam to tow you to the nearest base.
[177:41.90]Listen, hear me out.
[177:43.64]I've got to tell you something right now.
[177:44.88]It's very, very important.
[177:45.68]You need to hear this.
[177:46.26]So...
[177:50.29]Plugged in right now is the webcam and there's a USB 3.0 and a USB 2.0.
[177:57.70]I don't think the data was going fast enough.
[177:59.54]I had to put it in 3.0.
[178:00.38]Wait, wait, wait.
[178:06.52]That's awesome.
[178:07.38]So, plugged in right now is the webcam and there's a USB 3.0 and a USB 2.0.
[178:17.29]I don't think the data was going fast enough.
[178:19.11]I had to put it in 3.0.
[178:53.64]I know, it's unbelievable.
[178:56.18]But I can't believe it either.
[178:58.10]An asteroid might hit the Earth?
[179:23.45]What?
[179:24.33]Wouldn't you read that nonsense?
[179:27.93]What?
[179:29.31]What?
[179:30.81]What the fuck is that?
[179:32.41]I gotta go.
[179:33.41]I gotta get out of here.
[179:36.80]I gotta get out of here.
[180:08.32]Who do you think I was gonna catch?
[180:24.32]Into the sun.
[180:30.81]Fuck you!
[180:37.05]The nature of streamers, Jeremy Elbertson.
[180:46.94]How do you, I don't know, how do you give hugs?
[180:48.26]I don't know how you give, how do you give a hug?
[180:52.54]People just kind of do that.
[180:53.81]You just go like, hey, hi.
[180:55.65]Nobody comes like this.
[180:57.81]Like I'm a giant Venus flytrap about to squish you.
[181:03.38]Let me just tell you, I've got to be honest.
[181:05.36]I've never seen this movie.
[181:28.63]I almost spooked.
[181:34.65]I almost spooked.
[181:35.71]I almost did.
[181:47.08]I'm a green screen Rick.
[181:49.40]No.
[181:50.74]Hey, Rick.
[181:51.36]Hey, Morty.
[181:55.91]Oh, what is it, Rick?

[182:00.89]Oh, no.
[182:02.89]Yeah, Morty, you can be whatever you want in front of the green screen.
[182:07.75]I don't want to be you, Rick.
[182:09.67]Morty, get over there and be me.
[182:11.39]No, I don't want to, Morty.
[182:13.47]Morty, Morty, Morty, we're going to be on Reddit.
[182:15.01]Morty, we're going to be on Reddit here on the green screen.

[183:12.78]We're a McDonald's family, for Christ's sake.
[183:15.62]We only eat McDonald's.
[183:20.85]I'm really enjoying this school dance.
[183:25.80]Try to come a little closer.
[183:27.26]Whoever gambled all this money in the salon machine.
[183:47.56]What do you actually do with money?
[183:49.66]I have no fucking idea.
[183:52.00]Yes, player, $5,000.
[183:52.84]That's too much.
[183:54.27]Do you, like, spend it on something?
[183:55.81]I don't know.
[184:01.17]What do you do?
[184:01.91]Is it, like, a currency thing?
[184:02.83]I mean, what is it?
[184:04.11]I'm not sure.
[184:04.51]Is it, like, some kind of currency thing?
[184:06.05]I'm not sure.
[184:06.93]It's not real.
[184:09.58]I'm not, like, a real... Not a big deal.
[184:17.67]I'm like, not a big deal at all.
[184:18.81]You know what I'm saying?
[184:20.05]Not a big deal at all.
[184:23.01]I drew from my retirement account.
[184:28.52]And liquidated it.
[184:31.92]This is just sad.
[184:34.68]This is sad.
[184:36.04]This is not even funny.
[184:37.12]This is sad.
[184:38.44]This is just sadness.
[184:42.27]Alright, let's do it again.
[184:50.55]Do I win the big one?
[184:51.59]Do I win?
[184:52.07]I gotta win the big one right at the very end.
[185:13.92]It goes to the bank.
[185:19.23]Let's go, pal!
[185:19.89]I'm making it with you!
[185:21.23]Put your hands up!
[185:23.19]You're taking advantage of me!
[185:27.79]I said, stay down here!
[185:29.99]Five.
[185:30.35]Five, that's a milestone, alright?
[185:32.77]Five years old.
[185:33.67]You're getting old.
[185:35.57]She's an old man!
[185:37.53]She's an old man!
[185:38.39]Old what man?
[185:44.36]Wait, I'm not... This is not... This is not Jeffrey's birthday party?
[185:51.01]That's pretty thick headed.
[185:52.83]But nothing compared to the rich thick frosty mug taste of an A&W root beer.
[185:57.89]With A&W, it's good to be thick headed.
[186:00.81]Happy.
[186:02.10]What the fuck?
[186:03.18]I love it.
[186:04.46]I love it.
[186:05.48]I love it.
[186:06.08]What a dumbass.
[186:07.72]Alright.
[186:11.70]That's a lion skin.
[186:12.70]Five minutes old.
[186:13.94]Getting old.
[186:15.90]He's an old man.
[186:17.86]He's an old man.
[186:18.65]Old woman.
[186:24.64]Wait, I'm not... Isn't that... Isn't that Jeffrey's birthday party?
[186:31.28]That's pretty thick-headed.
[186:33.12]But nothing compared to the rich, thick, frosty mug taste of an A&W root beer.
[186:38.21]With A&W, it's good to be thick-headed.
[186:41.09]Happy.
[186:42.95]Oh my god.
[186:44.61]Unbelievable.
[186:48.07]Jerma wants some peace.
[186:55.58]Excuse me!
[186:58.12]Can we be quiet, please?
[187:00.42]Some of us are trying to sleep.
[187:11.04]What the hell happened?
[187:12.24]What?
[187:12.42]I... Yeah, that was fucking nuts.
[187:19.03]That was scary.
[187:21.89]Alright, this is called Jerm of Walk.
[187:25.41]Are you ready?
[187:26.90]I've been drinking water out of the sink.
[188:06.59]Why?
[188:15.39]The worst thing I've ever done in my entire career.
[188:17.77]Sad.
[188:37.46]Oh, please, please.
[188:43.02]Grandma, alone.
[188:43.66]Holy shit, that hair is bad.
[188:46.06]Fuck!
[188:49.20]Fuck!
[188:53.48]Hey, what's going on?
[188:58.33]Hey, welcome to my channel.
[188:59.53]Welcome to my vlog.
[189:00.81]As you can see, I'm... Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
[189:16.64]Die, you motherfucker!
[189:24.86]Awkward morning routine.
[189:32.13]So remember, if you like that video, follow me on my journey, where I virtually will kill you.
[189:38.29]Virtual murder.
[189:39.49]Virtual ASMR murder.
[189:44.32]Dude.
[189:51.45]That's Doug, by the way.
[189:52.49]We just heard him.
[189:53.45]Spoiler for the video, that's Doug.
[189:56.09]Uh, this is Jerma's Nightmare.
[189:57.77]After this one, I'm gonna take a- I gotta pee.
[189:59.49]I'm gonna take another quick break.
[190:00.63]I'm gonna see how many more we have left.
[190:03.07]It's probably quite a few.
[190:04.65]Here we go.
[190:06.98]Chika-pika, chika-pika-tika-ta.
[190:16.40]Jerma985.
[190:19.67]Bunker S.
[190:22.57]That's the one.
[190:35.21]Do you realize how fucking ugly you are until you get close?
[190:50.61]Take this from me right now.
[190:52.05]Take it from me.
[190:53.17]Take it from me, dude.
[190:54.29]I don't want to fucking hold it anymore.
[190:55.51]Take it from me.
[190:56.05]Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak out.
[190:58.79]Take it from me.
[190:59.35]Take it.
[190:59.87]You don't have to take it out of my fucking hands.
[191:09.20]I would be on the hot, hot side.
[191:18.07]That's not even it.
[191:19.63]Dad, I'm gonna be furring!
[191:46.11]No!
[191:46.67]No!
[191:48.21]No!
[191:54.31]Yeah!
[191:55.01]I'm up!
[191:56.66]Okay, uh... Alright, hold on, hold on.
[191:59.00]Let me... Let me take a piss.
[192:01.18]Oh my goodness.
[192:03.66]I don't know, I want an image of that... Ronald McDonald guy that was me.
[192:09.47]I kind of want that.
[192:10.01]Don't you want that picture?
[192:11.51]Somewhere?
[192:11.87]Even if it's in a folder in your computer somewhere, you don't even care about it.
[192:14.51]I just want it somewhere.
[192:17.71]Right back.
[194:52.56]Okay, I'm back.
[194:55.49]Those of you that are curious, we are about a third of the way through the videos.
[195:06.92]We're not even halfway.
[195:07.54]Okay.
[195:09.47]So I'm going to make the decision before we get any further here.
[195:14.69]When we get to the halfway point, there's gonna be a part two.
[195:18.73]We'll do a part two.
[195:20.17]Cause it's gonna be like five plus hours for part one.
[195:27.95]And at the rate that I have been flexing my chest back and forth, I don't think I'm gonna be able to sit here for another four or five hours.
[195:39.50]But hey, we can do it again.
[195:43.03]And by the way, this is not going to be like, oh, we'll do part two in like a month.
[195:46.79]No, no, within the next like four or five days.
[195:51.87]So let's keep going.
[195:52.55]We're not even close, by the way.
[195:54.03]We have at least another hour plus.
[195:56.45]Hour, maybe two hours before we get to the true halfway point.
[196:01.56]Here we go.
[196:03.92]Jerma dances.
[196:13.47]Oh, by the way, I don't think any of you knew that I could do this.
[196:30.52]Didn't think I could do that, did ya?
[196:37.88]That's pretty, that's real.
[196:40.37]That's pretty real.
[196:41.07]That's me.
[196:42.89]Mm-hmm.
[196:57.77]Dude, you know those movies?
[197:02.44]You ever see a movie?
[197:04.94]With a thing fucking popped up from the top?
[197:07.44]It's a boom microphone.
[197:08.66]Isn't that funny?
[197:09.72]Let's all get hyped for Metal Gear Solid V. Okay, that was... Jerma goes to interrupt a movie.
[197:15.30]Jerma 95 meets Jerma 984.
[197:17.78]Let's all get hyped for Metal Gear Solid V. Get hyped.
[197:23.90]Play button.
[197:26.41]So it's true.
[197:28.15]You and I are... Yes, twins.
[197:32.84]But we're not ordinary twins.
[197:35.36]We're twins linked by cursed genes.
[197:38.96]You're fine.
[197:40.46]You got all of the old man's dominant genes.
[197:43.61]I got all the flawed, recessive genes.
[197:48.43]Wait, what?
[197:50.21]You can't backtrack?
[197:52.33]Get him off!
[197:55.21]Get him off!
[197:57.21]Get him off!
[198:09.08]This is the hunter from Left for Dead.
[198:20.08]GEX FACTOR.
[198:52.30]Happy birthday to you.
[199:07.07]Happy birthday to you.
[199:22.09]Alright, that's it.
[199:32.04]Oh my god.
[199:50.85]You have gone through an obstacle far greater than anybody much older than you could even imagine going through.
[199:57.60]And then you come to this point and you make choices and you made the choice of singing that song.
[200:02.62]And it was so heartfelt and so inspirational.
[200:05.36]I just want to say thank you.
[200:06.82]Thank you.

[201:06.98]The golden... Wait, they've added a golden buzzer.
[201:11.64]Hold on a minute.
[201:13.24]Why did they add a golden... The golden buzzer means you can just veto everybody and just say that person gets to go.
[201:22.38]What's the point of having three judges when you just have a super button that one of them can just press?
[201:28.22]Yes.
[201:30.07]That's been a thing for a long time.
[201:32.51]I don't remember there being a super... Like...
[201:37.66]Omega LOL, really?
[201:39.14]It's been there for 10 years.
[201:40.90]Well, fuck this guy.
[201:42.81]I've been out watching America's Got Talent.
[201:44.79]Ever.
[201:45.01]I've never seen any full episode.
[201:46.23]I've never seen an episode.
[201:47.59]I have never seen one full episode of X Factor, America's Got Talent, or American Idol within the last 15 years.
[201:53.99]I've never seen an episode.
[201:55.29]That could have been there from the very beginning.
[201:58.66]Anyways, here it comes.
[202:00.02]Shut the fuck up.
[202:00.66]I'm listening to Jerma's Pirate Marching Band.
[202:05.68]Hi, Squash.
[202:08.74]What are you playing as?
[202:10.38]I'm playing as... What are you playing as?
[202:12.44]I'm gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 as... Leisurely Drive.
[202:43.19]What just happened?
[202:44.53]What?
[202:45.03]What the fuck was that?
[203:18.47]Why did I do that?
[203:19.11]I didn't do anything.
[203:19.91]I did... That was fucking crazy.
[203:23.74]I was like... Holy shit.
[203:30.48]Alright, next one.
[203:31.20]Infinity War!
[203:48.23]Both of them.
[203:49.35]I need my turn.
[204:18.58]Yeah, I actually do want to say something really quick.
[204:21.99]It's pretty heavy, but it's awful and terrible.
[204:25.15]And it makes me feel like shit.
[204:28.49]I've heard about Chadwick.
[204:30.62]It's a horrible, horrible fucking thing.
[204:34.36]And it really has been messing with me.
[204:37.24]Because he was young as shit.
[204:39.04]He was very young.
[204:41.14]And it really, really just crushes me.
[204:46.37]Because he was colon cancer.
[204:49.16]And I have colitis.
[204:51.28]I have, like, colon problems.
[204:52.60]And I get sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies.
[204:55.00]I've had, like, four of them, three of them in my life.
[204:57.96]And it's just so terrible to hear about that.
[205:02.16]It really, truly is.
[205:02.88]He was a great fucking actor.
[205:06.46]You talk about Black Panther, like, come on.
[205:11.02]It's incredibly sad.
[205:17.63]But yeah, I wanted to just... That's just... It hit me pretty fucking poorly when I heard about it.
[205:27.41]But yeah, we can keep going.
[205:28.82]We're going to do Elbertson's Fifth Sympathy.
[205:30.36]Here we go.
[206:12.69]It's supposed to be food.
[206:17.01]It's not.
[206:19.43]It's overacting everything.
[206:21.33]Yeah!
[206:23.55]Touchdown!
[206:24.91]You guys heard this, right?
[206:46.59]Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
[206:49.67]You're on a toilet visit.
[206:53.20]God, dude.
[206:55.54]What?
[206:55.78]What do you want from me?
[206:58.26]You fiends.
[206:59.20]You bastards.
[207:00.30]You villains.
[207:04.54]Okay, um... Oh my god!
[207:09.33]Why am I chained to the toilet?
[207:10.59]Okay, my bank account is 12-212-9994.
[207:11.41]The coordinates are six.
[207:15.77]My grandmother's address, and my grandmother's famous recipe for tomato sauce is two pounds of butter.
[207:21.25]I know it sounds like a lot, but man, why did you went right for that?
[207:27.34]Two pounds of tomato sauce.
[207:28.38]Why am I chained?
[207:29.68]You boil it, and then you take it off the burner, and you put it into the fridge for two hours.
[207:34.56]That's the secret.
[207:35.22]I'm skewed.
[207:35.76]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[207:38.11]Hey, everybody.
[207:39.77]Guess where I am.
[207:40.61]That's right, on vacation.
[207:44.57]Take a look.
[207:46.58]I never get to go out to places like this.
[207:49.24]So it's so much fun for me.
[207:52.22]Frog bump.
[207:57.48]Here it goes.
[207:57.84]Let me put my feet up.
[208:14.62]That's a pretty good, that's a pretty good view.
[208:18.56]This actually looks pretty relaxing.
[208:20.38]I would do this.
[208:22.68]What happened to that?
[208:29.27]Left animal.
[208:32.11]This is valuable.
[208:36.83]Worth a lot, probably.
[208:37.75]Findable food for the first time.
[208:46.72]You got really drunk at your wedding and won't leave.
[209:20.75]How was your day?
[209:23.71]That's pretty good.
[209:24.53]That's really good.
[209:25.63]Hold on.
[209:27.39]Yeah, it's like 1130.
[209:28.57]You have the venue till 1130.
[209:30.99]It's like, dude, you gotta, we gotta get the fuck out of here, man.
[209:34.49]You gotta go to sleep.
[209:35.31]So how was your day?
[209:36.63]It's Dermadarko.
[209:38.19]At least it's Donnie Darko.
[209:39.35]Spoilers for Donnie Darko.
[209:40.33]So how was your day, Susie?
[209:44.51]I'm voting for Dukakis.
[209:45.87]In class.
[209:48.02]That's unbelievable.
[209:49.54]Son?
[209:50.20]You're such a fuck-ass.
[209:51.36]What?
[209:52.34]You can go suck a fuck.
[209:53.63]Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
[209:56.21]What's a fuck-ass?
[209:57.25]My kids are the smartest.
[210:10.32]Boomerang.
[210:10.98]I don't think any of you knew that I could do this.
[210:20.18]Didn't think I could do that, did ya?
[210:21.86]Oh shoot, it was a boomerang.
[210:23.06]It was a boomerang bow.
[210:24.42]Don't use that one, delete that one.
[210:27.58]Okay, pick a turbo.
[210:28.55]Ow!
[210:28.61]Ow!
[210:28.75]Ow!
[210:28.97]Ow!
[210:29.11]My fucking bones!
[210:29.97]Ow!
[210:50.20]The Jerma one.
[210:51.28]It's from Kung Pao.
[211:38.93]Should we keep going?
[211:40.18]He said to hit him until he gave the signal to stop.
[211:45.76]Did anyone hear the signal?
[211:48.84]Well, he was whining for a while.
[211:52.66]Do you think whining was the signal?
[211:55.92]Hey, whoa, easy.
[211:57.16]We should wait a second or so.
[212:01.25]Hey, guys, come on.
[212:04.15]Oh, well.
[212:04.69]This is just a stream.
[212:15.01]Alright, with the kiss thing.
[212:16.41]What was that?
[212:17.01]Hey, wait, wait.
[212:19.59]He did say the part about dramatically throwing us off his body.
[212:22.83]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[212:27.21]Okay.
[212:35.05]Go ahead.
[212:35.77]Throw us off.
[212:42.14]There he is.
[212:44.73]You think he wants his tower?
[212:47.81]No, I'm not playing Jump King ever.
[212:49.25]Why does it blot all of my head?
[212:51.59]How do you do that?
[212:58.91]Hello, every- Alright, this is Jerma convinces you to watch a better video.

[213:45.76]It's a 12 minute and 41 second video.
[213:50.29]I did think it was good, though.
[213:54.33]Here comes Jerma Wars Episode 1, The Egg Menace.
[213:56.21]This is Star Wars Episode 1.
[213:57.97]Here we go.
[214:12.76]This is my town!
[214:17.32]Now you got it!
[214:22.75]Oscar!
[214:42.83]Dude, I looked over here.
[214:44.95]This way.
[214:46.15]You just been doing a what?
[214:47.73]SM what?
[214:48.21]I see all these costumes and all these devices and all these things to play with.
[214:55.75]And it's a fucking mess over here.
[214:57.89]There's like 75 items over here.
[215:00.53]And then I'm looking over here.
[215:01.73]There's a door right there.
[215:03.78]And there's a big... You're in front of like a green screen.
[215:07.52]You're like apparently driving right now.
[215:10.54]Oh wow, look out there, this looks really great on my fucking green screen.
[215:14.16]This looks so stupid.
[215:20.15]Hey, you remember that water park?
[215:24.71]This did look so funny, I remember the first time I've ever seen this.
[215:28.75]I'm just gonna take E.T.
[215:30.73]Bro, this sucks.
[215:33.73]Don't ever tell me I can't sing.
[215:35.89]I'll prove you wrong by playing this video.
[216:34.49]I'm waiting for you to throw a piece of popcorn into my mouth, and I'm very confused that you haven't done it yet.
[217:03.72]that was awesome this barber Jerma oh I don't know what do you skip like this
[217:30.33]What do you want?
[217:31.13]Good morning.
[217:31.91]You and me, I know you.
[217:33.12]We're going to do it.
[217:34.04]Fine.
[217:34.94]What?
[217:35.22]Good.
[217:35.60]I see we don't have to wait today.
[217:37.80]Son, you are in big trouble.
[217:40.90]Listen, I'd like for you to take a little more off this time, you know, especially around those ears.
[217:46.35]That reminds me, my dog got itching ears.
[217:48.85]Every time she would scratch herself, she'd howl and she'd squeal.
[217:52.45]So you know what?
[217:54.25]I decided to take her to the vet.
[217:57.29]But instead of him fixing her itching ears, he told me to go home and get a pile of her stool.
[218:02.44]Well, of course, we call it number two.
[218:04.74]I couldn't imagine, what does that have to do with itching ears?
[218:07.26]So I went home, well, not to get the number two.
[218:09.92]Instead, I called the Veterans Hospital, and they tell me, well, we treat people here, not dogs, and that I should call the vet hospital.
[218:17.28]But I said, this is the vet hospital, isn't it?
[218:19.56]You know, he hung up on me.
[218:24.93]Hey, what's with you mister?
[218:30.05]I'll make my exit now, if you could look at me.
[218:52.16]I tell you, I wouldn't if my son was sitting there and the barber was doing this.
[218:57.30]Alright, everyone, get in your place.
[219:00.04]Hold on, hold on.
[219:03.67]the number two hospital.
[219:05.51]The barber is doing this.
[219:06.51]We treat people here, not dogs, and that I should call the vet hospital.
[219:10.31]But I said this is the vet hospital.
[219:11.67]I'm going to say, okay, it's time for us to leave because the barber is, he's on everything.
[219:17.75]He probably combined like four or five things together in a blender and just drank it.
[219:22.81]And we have to leave now.
[219:23.93]But I said this is the vet hospital.
[219:25.13]I don't think I'm going to be here with this guy.
[219:26.47]You know, he hung up on me.
[219:31.87]He's too busy talking.
[219:34.01]Alright, everyone, get your places.
[219:37.31]Alright.
[219:38.33]Today is the big day.
[219:39.49]Wait, is this the actor?
[219:40.93]Is this the better actor?
[219:41.87]In fact, better actor.
[219:46.01]Okay.
[219:46.87]Alright, just remember that today is the big day.
[219:50.87]Excuse me.
[219:54.27]Can we be quiet, please?
[219:56.57]Some of us are trying to sleep.
[219:58.37]Oh, sorry.

[220:04.61]Okay.
[220:05.35]Better green screen.
[220:06.17]It's not a better green screen.
[220:07.91]It's more technology than I have.

[220:27.83]I understand.
[220:28.53]And I'm sick and tired of hearing it.
[220:31.19]It looks so evil.

[220:33.11]Okay.
[220:33.69]And I pay rent too.
[220:34.77]Okay, we'll keep it quiet, alright?
[220:36.31]Unbelievable.

[220:37.55]We'll lower it.
[220:39.43]Wasn't it already closed?
[220:41.69]Anyways, everyone, get to your place, alright?

[222:13.88]We know who the challenger is.
[222:15.78]A man that's been screwed out of the Intercontinental title more times than we can keep track of.
[222:24.71]Getting an opportunity, and maybe you never know, could be his last opportunity to challenge Christian for the Intercontinental Championship.
[222:34.70]Well, it should be his last opportunity.
[222:36.50]985 at Freddy's.
[222:44.06]Alright, that was... come on.
[222:50.69]It's called Vibe.
[222:52.05]Don't you feel like it would be annoying to be in this room?
[222:58.41]This is how you walk around this room.
[223:00.76]Okay, you ready?
[223:17.57]Yeah, yeah, I still, uh, yeah, I'm still going to school.
[223:21.13]I'm still at, uh, yeah, I'm still at, uh, UUU.
[223:23.52]Uh, what are you doing now?
[223:26.92]How are the kids?
[223:29.44]Like, that's all, that's the whole day.
[223:31.06]That's, why does that, nobody, why doesn't, I don't like that.
[223:35.56]I don't understand what it is.
[223:38.58]It hurts to be in this room for five minutes.
[223:44.41]You're going to see the images of these lights for four or five hours after you leave.
[223:48.86]It's going to be burned into your retina.
[223:52.52]I want just a soft lit room with a little bit of no fucking loud ass music of a jazz band playing like five rooms away behind glass.
[224:01.81]So you can look over and you can see them playing in the glass in the club and then it's recorded inside of the glass and then they pump that whatever volume they decide through a control system into the rest of the club.
[224:15.81]You understand?
[224:16.51]That's the perfect solution.
[224:24.99]There's four hours of drama condensed into 27 seconds.
[225:01.94]No, don't skip it.
[225:04.90]This is every school cafeteria I've ever been in.
[225:09.79]Whoever goes too hog wild on stream and gets wicked heart, heart-wrenching.
[225:15.09]I don't think any of you knew that I could do this.
[225:34.92]Yeah, I had a ton of fun, but I think I really fucked myself up.
[225:37.86]Once the fun juice wore off, I turned into the Tin Man.
[225:39.88]Keep an eye on Sus, my doctor's going to ground me.
[225:41.56]The man was forced to perform a torture dance for 7,000 people.
[225:51.95]His spine and leg have been broken and shattered.
[225:55.83]I'll just type jermaVenus in chat, Hog Champ, and laugh at him.
[226:01.97]He spent the rest of the night crawling around in a sewer because he had nowhere else to go.
[226:07.93]Shit!
[226:09.73]This is bad!
[226:13.10]Please help him.
[226:13.80]Now he lives in heaven, but not dead.
[226:19.04]Wouldn't that make me dead?
[226:34.46]Played League of... The Witch's Curse Part 3.

[228:16.56]Am I just typing Witch's Curse?
[228:21.66]We're not going to watch the whole thing.
[228:22.58]We're going to skip through it.
[228:23.90]We'll do it with some recaps.
[228:35.22]I'm not gonna click that, that's a rickroll.
[228:37.24]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna find it myself.

[230:04.27]Exit the helicopter, evaluate the damage.
[230:29.74]Alright, what's worse, that image or the first image that pops up when you type Jerma985 into an image search?
[230:35.40]They're pretty comparable.
[230:36.80]I wonder what that means.
[230:45.26]The witch has shrunken them.
[230:48.26]See, we got shrunken.
[230:50.52]They begin their search through the swamp to fix the cure for us being shrunken down.
[231:01.17]That thing's in the distance, right?

[243:47.62]Thanks for asking.
[243:48.10]Would you like to come over?
[243:49.06]Yeah, dude.
[243:49.52]I don't know.
[243:50.64]I'm getting kind of busy, but I don't see if I can schedule it in, something like that.
[243:55.30]You know what I mean?
[243:55.84]Alright.
[243:57.04]Yeah, he'd be like, whoa.

[244:08.23]Yeah, cool, dude.
[244:11.73]And then he would look me dead in the eyes and be like, I'm actually a big fan of fucking morons acting like idiots and sucking at everything.
[244:19.38]And then I would be like... What?
[244:25.96]I don't know what we're doing.
[244:27.58]And then my face would start to... You know when your face starts to get a little red?
[244:30.88]You can tell your face is slowly... You can feel the blood kind of going into your face.
[244:37.12]And my brain... He knows.
[244:39.30]He knows that I'm turning red.
[244:40.99]And then it'd get even more red.
[244:43.07]And then you kind of do something to make it look like that it was supposed to be red in the first place.
[244:48.51]It's like hot in here.
[244:50.07]Starbucks keep their temperature at like 80 or something.
[244:51.97]Jesus, it's fucking hot.
[244:52.59]I don't know what you're talking about though, Peter.
[244:54.41]That's funny that you say that.
[244:59.13]They're like, I'm going crazy.
[245:01.44]And he spits directly into my face.
[245:05.96]And there's no debating that that's what he meant to do.
[245:11.34]Okay.
[245:12.26]Okay.
[245:14.45]Stranger, Danger, Jerm of Greenspring.

[245:43.38]Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak out.
[245:46.13]Take it from me.
[245:46.69]Take it.
[245:47.19]You don't have to take it out of my fucking hands.
[245:59.74]Stop right there and don't make me do more work, asshole!
[246:06.13]Okay, sure.
[246:27.89]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[247:58.91]Ah, that's a guy.
[247:59.54]That's a poem.
[248:11.22]I feel like I'm on drugs right now.

[249:27.57]Why are your arms so skinny?
[249:29.11]It's the green screen.
[249:30.28]It's like the green screen bleeding in.
[249:42.75]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[249:44.63]I can't even pay attention.
[249:46.03]Turkey arms.

[251:36.69]Alright, we are like 10 videos away from being at the halfway point.
[251:41.40]10 to 20.
[251:44.08]And then we're going to save part 2.
[251:45.40]We're going to save the other 130 plus videos.

[255:11.42]This is going to be a single-player Let's Play.
[255:14.12]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm...
[255:49.05]Wait, that's a thing on top.
[256:02.48]Christ.

[257:04.36]I haven't seen Season 2.
[257:09.40]I don't want to see anything from Season 2.
[257:12.16]Season 1.
[257:12.90]Yeah, this is Season 1.
[257:13.86]Don't scare me like that.
[257:15.48]Okay, here we go.
[257:15.92]Ready?
[257:16.04]Ready?
[257:18.05]That's a Season 1 fake fan.
[257:19.37]Alright, it's the first season.
[257:20.87]It's a Season 1, Episode 2 of... I almost said Fall Guys.
[257:26.75]Okay.
[257:27.21]No, this is One Punch Man.
[257:30.63]So here comes some spoilers for One Punch Man.
[257:35.78]I gotta do it every time!
[257:38.26]One Punch Man.
[257:38.70]If you've seen the series, then I'm warning you.
[257:40.30]Here comes an Episode 1 of JermaCraft.
[257:43.83]It looks like you're registered.
[257:44.87]There's a hero with a fan club.
[257:46.37]Well, I don't care about that.
[257:47.95]Thank you for asking me to do this today.
[257:50.89]Well, I promised to make you my disciple.
[257:54.33]Is that alright?
[257:54.83]Yes.
[257:55.61]But even if you say it's a match, it's not real, is it?
[258:00.06]That's what I'm going to do.
[258:02.78]To get you serious.
[258:14.23]It's a pirated episode?
[258:15.27]No, it's not.
[258:58.75]I mean, hold on.
[259:00.51]This is a really important question to ask.
[259:04.61]If I put me over a main character of a show, can I watch that show?
[259:12.90]If somebody were to do the entire, the full episode 1 through 10 of me doing all the lines, is it like a cover?
[259:22.40]Is it a parody?
[259:24.58]At what point is it like it's just me doing the whole episode?
[259:29.48]I mean, it's very clearly transformative content, right?
[259:33.75]But would that even be?
[259:35.69]I don't know.
[259:36.21]You're talking about a copyright law loophole.
[259:44.09]I don't think... Is it though?
[259:55.66]I don't think that would hold up in, I don't know.
[260:14.41]You're going to jail.
[260:20.75]No, it's transformative.
[260:21.75]You change it.
[260:22.39]The media becomes something completely different.
[260:25.49]It's not... This is not completely different.
[260:27.97]This is just me doing it.
[260:28.95]Okay, so we're gonna... No, it's transformative.
[260:33.06]It is.
[260:48.62]You guys are freaking me out right now.
[260:50.12]I'm getting freaked out.

[261:09.37]You're freaking me out.
[261:21.82]I don't know what this is.
[261:32.39]This is from The Matrix.
[261:42.22]Don't sneeze.
[261:43.56]Don't sneeze right now.
[261:45.34]Do not sneeze.
[261:46.12]I'm going to sneeze.
[261:48.27]I just want you to know, I just want you to understand, I'm going to sneeze.

[268:02.78]Okay?
[268:17.38]If you hide yourself in the clear sky, the wind will blow your body away.

[269:58.24]Let me take a look.
[269:59.12]I don't want to spoil anything.
[270:01.48]Alright.
[270:02.24]We are going to be at the halfway point in exactly... In probably two more videos.
[270:10.13]In one more.
[270:10.87]We'll do this one.
[270:12.31]Two more.
[270:13.45]Alright.
[270:13.71]Two more videos.
[270:15.93]I think I gotta go take a bath.
[270:18.96]Yes, we're not even halfway yet.
[270:20.92]We're just, we're barely crossing the halfway point.
[270:24.80]There was a lot of, there's a ton of content.
[270:28.68]And I knew I was going to have to break it up into two.
[270:33.38]This is called Jerma's Day in Animal Crossing.
[270:36.26]Take a shower instead.
[270:37.88]No, I don't want to do that.
[270:38.82]I don't want to take a shower.
[270:41.86]I want to take, I want to get in the bath and I want to just put my head, my entire head underneath, just blow as hard as I can out of my nose.
[270:48.26]So it's like... And then my hair turns into like weird ghost material.
[270:56.12]It just floats around and you just get that weird ghost material feeling with your hair and your nose and then you just come right up.
[271:04.18]I'm getting, why am I getting question marks?
[271:06.94]When you put your head under water, your hair floats up and becomes this weird, like, ether, aether, whatever, material.
[271:14.91]Like, nether world, whatever, material.
[271:17.09]No, it's true, it really is.
[271:17.95]Somebody said it, thank you, one person.
[271:20.89]Put your head, I'm telling you, next time you're in a pool or something, just see how it feels and see what it looks like.
[271:27.68]And touch it.
[271:28.40]It's weird.
[271:31.44]Somebody said that.
[271:32.06]Somebody said true.
[271:32.76]I saw it.
[271:33.16]I saw it in the chatroom.
[271:33.88]You can't fucking lie to me.
[271:35.74]Never bullshit a bullshitter.
[271:39.63]Creamer... No, I'm saying... I'm telling... Just go... On your own time.
[271:43.81]On your own leisure.
[271:45.29]Just put your head under water when you can and when you're comfortable.
[271:49.41]It's true.
[271:49.87]Thank... I'm so happy to see this.

[281:28.01]Five straight hours and we're only halfway.
[281:29.81]There's so much more.
