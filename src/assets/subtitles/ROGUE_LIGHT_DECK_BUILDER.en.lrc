[ve:61.1.100]

[00:03.75]Okay, let's turn that off too.
[00:06.55]We don't need a soundtrack anymore, I don't think.
[00:10.81]In case we do, I will pause it.
[00:12.15]Alright, let's play this one.
[00:14.27]Let's check it out.
[00:24.73]Rogue Light Deck Builder.
[00:30.99]I love the patch notes for this game.
[00:33.53]The patch notes say, first patch, I think I fixed everything.
[00:38.56]Well, I think it's fixed now.
[00:40.72]And then after that, another patch, I'm pretty sure I fixed everything.
[00:48.42]That's alright.
[00:49.32]This one might be pretty good.
[01:01.66]Fixed for real this time.
[01:03.04]Alright.
[01:07.66]I wonder if this even captures well.
[01:09.10]Let's see.
[01:15.32]Can you see it?
[01:17.10]Why is it so small?
[01:24.73]Okay.
[01:25.03]Let's turn the volume up.
[01:26.87]Settings.
[01:29.19]Holy shit.
[01:32.21]That was not.
[01:37.67]Uh, we're going to keep everything the way it is.
[01:41.07]Borderless.
[01:41.99]Borderless window runs at your monitor's native resolution.
[01:44.27]This may cause very poor performance.
[01:52.42]Just full screen it?
[01:56.94]Uh oh.
[01:58.42]Oh boy.
[01:58.84]Uh.
[02:02.83]Hold on.
[02:04.53]I think I want that back.
[02:06.21]Yeah, we're going to stay with this.
[02:08.91]Oh, Lord.
[02:14.28]OK.
[02:16.46]So what about audio?
[02:19.44]This is a this I got to bring these all the way down.
[02:24.14]You know that when I hit it, when I do build the deck, you probably use like a hammer and shit.
[02:28.62]I saw the little fucking clip.
[02:31.04]It's probably so loud.
[02:34.59]We'll start with that.
[02:35.15]Alright, play.
[02:43.71]I am husband.
[02:44.29]We are improving home.
[02:45.85]You build the deck.
[02:47.66]You will get money.
[02:50.12]Okay.
[02:54.44]This game is crunchy.
[02:57.74]I kind of like it already.
[02:58.68]Alright.
[03:01.44]So go build the deck.
[03:04.08]Hold on, I need my mousepad.
[03:10.92]Okay, I have $4.
[03:13.90]Go build deck.
[03:24.10]WS?
[03:24.20]Oh.
[03:25.22]What the hell is that?
[03:34.09]How do you do this?
[03:39.14]Oops.
[03:46.62]Okay.
[03:48.30]I got a dollar for that.
[03:50.50]So you click and then you have to go.
[03:51.92]Alright.
[04:07.81]Can I die?
[04:09.85]Ooh, those are perfect.
[04:12.19]I'm still... I get it.
[04:12.87]Do I just actually build a deck and that's it?
[04:37.36]I'm interested.
[04:44.88]How do you get a perfect?
[04:46.50]Please use WS or mouse wheel to traverse the plank.
[04:49.09]Oh, okay.
[04:59.35]Should I go to the store?
[05:00.03]Oops.
[05:05.71]This is a bad nail.
[05:18.56]You gotta finish the deck first.
[05:27.13]I feel like those are better than OK.
[05:28.67]Those feel like they were pretty good.
[05:39.89]What's wrong with those?
[05:59.45]Watch for bugs?
[06:07.64]That just scared the shit out of me.
[06:08.68]I thought somebody was coming over from the right side of the screen.
[06:10.62]They're like, shoot me.
[06:11.34]Do you have any click reference?
[06:13.70]Thank you.
[06:14.48]But actually, that scared the shit out of me for real.
[06:21.31]Swing harder?
[06:26.05]You kind of can't, like if I... No, it's just going to be...
[06:40.16]You lose money if you do it wrong.
[06:43.27]That's bad.
[06:43.77]Okay.
[06:50.97]That was perfect.
[06:59.00]I don't understand the perfect thing.
[06:59.98]There we go.
[07:11.67]Buy band-aids?
[07:16.49]That's good.
[07:26.29]Faster?
[07:26.67]I think faster is better.
[07:28.79]Fuck.
[07:37.42]You get a better hammer, I guarantee it.
[07:43.04]Alright, so I'm going to build the deck and then is the game over after I build the deck?
[07:57.53]See, again, I thought that was something from the other side of the screen coming to get me.
[08:06.88]Those are perfect.
[08:08.06]There's nothing wrong with those at all.
[08:18.22]So you get an extra dollar if you do perfect.
[08:23.44]Alright, only a couple more.
[08:37.73]Bug.
[08:50.91]How do I get the bug?
[08:58.71]What the fuck?
[09:11.17]Probably get five bucks for squashing the bug.
[09:20.31]OK, almost done.
[09:28.49]I can't move it up.
[09:41.28]Let me try to get two or three perfects in a row.
[09:45.68]Right there is where I want to go up down.
[09:48.40]Oh my God.
[10:09.31]I don't know what was wrong with the second one.
[10:11.25]Alright, almost done.
[10:15.32]Harder and further than you think.
[10:30.28]Come on!
[10:38.38]Go on.
[10:39.96]Swing it, swing it.
[10:41.02]What?
[10:45.09]That was all perfect.
[10:49.97]Is that random?
[11:04.44]Okay.
[11:08.49]Alright, here's the last one.
[11:11.03]And I got $44.
[11:12.99]And I don't know what happens after this, but this game was like $3.
[11:16.07]So I wouldn't... Did we just beat the game?
[11:21.69]Alright, this is it.
[11:42.95]GG.
[11:46.93]Perfect nail.
[11:47.49]Zero.
[11:48.87]Perfect hits.
[11:50.03]29.
[11:50.51]Okay.
[11:50.85]Hits.
[11:51.73]Splat.
[11:52.61]Planks.
[11:53.21]Money earned.
[11:54.25]Bonks.
[11:54.99]Ouches.
[11:57.15]Okay.
[11:57.65]Go back inside.
[12:02.98]You created a joinder between planks to arrange them into a deck.
[12:07.24]Thank you.
[12:07.54]The next thing you need to do is build me a deck.
[12:10.60]Another one?
[12:17.77]Improve hand.
[12:20.21]Improve hammer, better balance, perfect hits, easier.
[12:23.72]Ah, it's one of these games.
[12:26.24]Okay.
[12:30.04]Less annoying bulb.
[12:35.19]Index funds, mostly low risk, make money passively for 50 bucks.
[12:42.97]Improve hand and hand technique, harder to hurt, easier, perfects.
[12:48.52]I'm going to do that.
[12:51.50]And then make the bulb not blink as much.
[12:56.46]You need a million dollars.
[13:00.32]Okay.
[13:00.78]I get it.
[13:01.52]Make the bugs better.
[13:02.28]Alright, let's go.
[13:05.91]I'm into it.
[13:12.25]$1 million.
[13:13.11]Alright.
[13:13.67]Let's see if this is actually easier.
[13:21.04]Not really.
[13:28.22]Actually, maybe it is.
[13:37.48]That was perfect.
[13:38.20]There's nothing wrong with those at all.
[13:39.66]You didn't buy the hammer.
[13:42.40]Yeah, but is that I could do it easier with this one?
[13:54.48]Good.
[13:55.74]Well, now that I know that it actually takes money away if you get hurt... I'm more inclined to be careful.
[14:02.97]Shit.
[14:23.82]Buy the index fund and then go play Chrono Trigger.
[14:33.32]Just come back in like an hour and see if I have a million dollars.
[14:38.96]How much was the hammer?
[14:39.62]The hammer was, what, 50, 60, 70?
[14:44.18]That bug, I missed it.
[15:02.96]I'm waiting for the bug.
[15:14.75]I already have more money.
[15:26.32]Only light taps for me, please.
[15:28.52]I'll make it worth your while.
[15:39.79]yeah 15 bucks whoa that's actually cool imagine being high as playing this in VR
[16:08.31]I'm not sure I'd want to be inebriated at all.
[16:12.17]There you are.
[16:12.59]I've been looking for you.
[16:13.71]We can't talk yet.
[16:16.29]It's not safe.
[16:17.49]Nail me in.
[16:22.50]There's more going on in this game.
[16:23.58]It's going to be a scary game.
[16:24.48]It's going to be a jump scare.
[16:26.20]Somebody's going to be under the deck.
[16:39.06]No, I missed the bug again.
[16:40.42]The bugs are hard to get because you kind of just mash in and then just walk over there.
[17:00.94]You're very easily entertained like a toddler.
[17:05.38]Hold on, there's a bug right there.
[17:11.57]I can't- his hand is in the way!
[17:13.35]How do you crush the bugs?
[17:26.53]Move your hand?
[17:28.96]Can I move my hand?
[17:32.48]I- okay, when you put the nail down, you can't move your hand.
[17:36.28]Take your hand off first?
[17:37.70]How do you take your hand off?
[17:39.72]Whoa.
[17:45.63]I'm getting the hammer next.
[17:55.29]What the fuck are you talking about?
[17:56.96]What?
[18:00.46]Slow that down.
[18:01.44]No way.
[18:02.88]How did I miss that?
[18:03.76]What's wrong with me?
[18:17.80]I'm not going to get a single bug, am I?
[18:21.31]That's sad.
[18:33.23]It probably gives like 20.
[18:38.99]I'm convinced it's hard to hit the bug.
[18:46.38]Bug lover.
[18:49.87]I have definitely become a lot more kind to the insects of the world, I think.
[18:58.48]I still do want to get those blue beetles.
[18:59.94]Probably the coolest looking insect in the world.
[19:04.30]What were they called again?
[19:05.62]They were called like blue cool beetles?
[19:07.38]Cool looking blue beetles?
[19:09.41]On Google Images?
[19:10.41]Cool blue beetle?
[19:12.45]Cool looking blue beetle?
[19:19.19]What?
[19:29.11]Very bug of all time.
[19:30.61]This one.
[19:35.04]Blue death-feigning beetles.
[19:36.46]That's the one.
[19:39.86]They like eating grapes.
[19:40.84]They're just cool.
[19:41.64]They're cool as hell.
[19:45.32]They're like little sweethearts.
[19:49.25]Go look them up.
[19:50.05]You tell me that that's not a cool thing to have.
[19:57.24]Ever since seeing a bug's life, I've been... Yeah.
[20:06.16]And they pretend to be... Wait.
[20:09.90]What do I do with this guy?
[20:15.28]That guy didn't talk.
[20:18.20]Alright, last two.
[20:31.25]Alright, I got a hundred bucks.
[20:32.87]That's enough for the new mallet.
[20:39.72]How do you fuck up the last nail?
[20:46.40]Okay.
[20:46.82]$97.
[20:46.86]Did you enjoy building that last deck?
[20:53.56]I saw you building it and looked like you were having fun.
[20:57.80]Please go build another deck outside.
[20:59.50]Okay.
[21:05.12]Better hammer.
[21:08.42]I don't think I can do anything else.
[21:13.49]Are you seeing the African hissing cockroaches?
[21:23.77]No, I don't.
[21:24.61]I don't really want to see an African hissing cockroach.
[21:27.44]I don't want to see a hissing cockroach.
[21:29.06]I don't want to see any cockroach.
[21:33.34]Cockroaches are cool.
[21:34.88]They're wonderful little creatures.
[21:37.22]But you know, remember in Ace Ventura when he's terrified of the bat?
[21:42.46]It's just like blah.
[21:44.30]I just did something about him.
[21:50.44]This must be easier to get perfect.
[21:51.99]Let me get this right.
[21:56.39]I guess it is a little bit easier.
[22:06.50]Yeah, they serve a very important purpose.
[22:08.24]I agree.
[22:08.62]What was wrong with that last one?
[22:26.41]Got it.
[22:26.63]What's that worth?
[22:29.65]50 bucks.
[22:31.35]I knew it was going to be something crazy.
[22:32.73]$50 for that.
[22:33.71]That's crazy.
[22:34.53]Alright.
[22:35.45]Holy smokes.
[22:38.31]I just paid for everything.
[22:39.15]Am I going too hard?
[22:52.22]I think it's just... What the hell is this?
[22:54.58]Cash plank?
[22:56.70]What the fuck?
[23:01.38]I gotta go fast?
[23:14.05]Two dollars?
[23:21.90]I gotta go up here.
[23:27.56]He's gonna walk over there.
[23:30.08]How's that a cash plank?
[23:31.26]It was nothing.
[23:43.58]Perfect nail bullshit.
[23:50.84]Fuck.
[24:06.42]Bullshit.
[24:12.33]there was a reboot of cash cab and they wanted you to host it would you do that uh no no I would crash I can't no that that's too much god damn it
[24:30.15]There's no way I can't do shit like that.
[24:31.71]Like, oh, everybody, here we go.
[24:33.00]Welcome to the cash cab.
[24:35.06]Here we are.
[24:35.58]Our first question.
[24:36.70]Hold on.
[24:37.62]Is there right on red here?
[24:39.46]Before I go to my first question, you guys know if this is right on red?
[24:43.68]I'm sorry.
[24:45.47]Your first question is who was the third president of the fuck?
[24:50.23]I'm sorry.
[24:51.39]Of the United States.
[24:52.67]It's you got 10 seconds to hold on.
[24:54.61]Is this a there's a yield here?
[24:58.16]No, no way.
[25:02.79]Absolutely no chance.
[25:15.04]Yes!
[25:19.28]That would be funnier, though.
[25:20.40]Yeah, but that's fucking dangerous.
[25:23.20]I don't want to do that.
[25:24.13]It's coming.
[25:25.93]Do you feel it?
[25:27.19]It's not here yet.
[25:28.41]Hammer me.
[25:37.40]Are you an offensive or a defensive driver?
[25:40.54]I'm a very defensive driver.
[25:41.60]I will pay you to treat me tenderly.
[25:47.79]Here we go.
[25:56.65]What the hell was that by the way?
[25:57.85]That was a loud weird sound effect.
[26:07.89]Yeah, but I don't like the term offensive driver.
[26:11.94]It's not a football game.
[26:14.02]You're getting from point A to point B. That doesn't mean... I'm just going to merge and cut this guy off and then I'm going to like fucking throw something out the window and I'm going to smoke a cigarette and throw the cigarette out the window.
[26:23.06]Oh, is this right on red?
[26:24.56]I don't even care.
[26:25.14]I'm just going to do it anyways.
[26:27.54]Stop sign?
[26:28.50]Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[26:29.28]I don't stop at those.
[26:30.35]I just kind of go through them and slowly go through them and just you're going to stop at your stop sign.
[26:38.92]You know what drives me absolutely fucking crazy?
[26:40.73]I don't know what's going on, man, but like the world of people not using their directionals, it's like the first thing that you learn.
[26:52.20]I don't know what you're doing.
[26:53.90]And for some reason, people just assume that everybody else knows what they're doing.
[27:01.69]It's like if I'm coming out, let's say if I'm taking a right out of somewhere and you are driving straight on the road coming the other direction, if you don't have your turn signal on and you want to go into where I'm coming from, I don't know you're going to do that.
[27:19.28]Use your turn signals.
[27:21.11]Use your turn signals.
[27:22.15]If you don't use them, you better start now.
[27:34.87]And it's just like, you know, I don't know.
[27:36.25]I don't care.
[27:36.95]Whatever.
[27:38.63]It's not a big deal.
[27:41.08]That is a big deal.
[27:42.80]You pissed me off.
[27:44.20]You pissed me off.
[27:45.56]It's a big deal.
[27:55.35]Ego.
[27:56.97]No, I feel like everybody feels the same way.
[28:10.96]Anytime like somebody does something crazy on the road like cuts you off or like drives like going like 60 and a 30.
[28:16.73]It's just like dude, what is what is wrong with you?
[28:20.75]Why slow the fuck down?
[28:26.47]Too dangerous.
[28:30.69]Alright, there it is.
[28:38.34]That's a lot of money.
[28:40.88]Perfect time to take a break.
[28:43.24]I kind of like this game.
[28:43.98]It's good to just sit and talk about driving.
[28:48.71]The light outside does not work.
[28:49.99]So great.
[28:50.45]Yeah, I knew.
[28:53.25]It's not about being passed.
[28:54.17]It's that they couldn't pass the driver's test if they did that.
[28:57.53]They shouldn't have a license.
[29:01.60]I think that we all need to be more courteous to each other on the road.
[29:16.50]Does Massachusetts have worse drivers than Vegas?
[29:21.17]I don't think the mass drivers are that bad.
[29:25.99]We'll discuss when I get back.
[29:28.14]Here we go.
[33:25.83]I see you guys talking about the, um, the big bright led lights that everybody has now.
[33:34.89]Yeah.
[33:36.63]Yeah.
[33:36.79]It's called, um, sometimes somebody will turn, they'll be in the opposite lane and somebody like somebody flash banged you.
[33:51.13]So, okay, I'm one of those drivers.
[33:54.11]I am like very annoyed driver, right?
[33:57.51]Like, I'll be like, what is, what is, what, what?
[33:59.45]Holly will be, will be driving somewhere and I'll be like, can you fucking look, look what this guy's doing?
[34:03.79]Look at this guy, two cars in front of us.
[34:05.23]What the fuck is that?
[34:05.83]What's that guy's problem?
[34:07.55]God, what a fucking idiot that guy is.
[34:10.75]I'm just like, I constantly like, something about being behind the wheel and people just doing dumb shit on the road.
[34:17.41]It's just like, that guy, that guy right there.
[34:24.90]I just get, it's just, it just bothers me when it, okay.
[34:28.00]Can we get a poll?
[34:28.98]I want a poll.
[34:31.02]I want a poll that's asking, are you one of these, like, if you're a dickhead driver and some of you might not know you are, but maybe some of you do.
[34:41.32]If you're a dickhead driver, like ones in the chat, like, or, or just like, yes or no.
[34:45.14]Are you a dickhead driver?
[34:47.22]Cause I want to, we need to ask a few questions.
[34:58.68]I've always like, I have this like weird fantasy where I sit down and interview one of these people.
[35:04.09]Like, yeah, what's up?
[35:05.31]Okay.
[35:05.57]So I thank you for your time.
[35:06.41]I appreciate it.
[35:07.53]So a couple of quick questions.
[35:08.81]First of all, thank you for coming.
[35:10.47]Yeah, whatever.
[35:11.15]Fuck you.
[35:11.59]You bitch.
[35:13.53]Okay.
[35:14.16]Great.
[35:14.68]Good start.
[35:15.80]Um, I would like to add this.
[35:16.98]So you're from around here?
[35:19.29]yeah what the I don't care great okay so when you're on the road and when I'm in front of when I'm in front of you when I'm behind you so let's say I'm behind you and I'm and you're using you want to change lanes can I ask you why you don't put the right blinker on for one or two seconds before you change your lane and I I have this fantasy with it just like I don't care like you and I'm just like no no you be better be better about this
[35:50.55]And no, my ass is not slow.
[35:53.07]We're talking about, we're talking about like, if it's like a 45, some people want to go like 60, 70 in the 45.
[36:00.14]It's like, why, that, I am, even if you were to go five miles, even 10 miles per hour over the speed limit, which is fucking, that's a lot, right?
[36:11.02]People want to go faster than that.
[36:13.86]It's like, dude, why do you want to go like 20 miles per hour over the speed limit?
[36:18.78]Be fucking careful.
[36:24.02]If you're gonna go like 45 at a 40 and somebody behind you is like, what the fuck?
[36:28.10]Get out of the fucking way.
[36:29.32]I want to go 60.
[36:30.06]Like, holy shit, man.
[36:33.23]Ooh.
[36:49.85]That's New Jersey in a nutshell.
[36:52.07]Alright.
[36:54.71]This is a great poll.
[36:55.60]Are you an asshole?
[37:03.48]So we got 30% assholes here, apparently.
[37:06.14]Alright.
[37:09.00]The next poll is going to be the first very basic question.
[37:18.43]I got new nails.
[37:19.61]I'm ready.
[37:21.21]So this is only a poll for the assholes.
[37:23.75]This is not for any of the goody two shoes that are here.
[37:26.65]If you're a goody two shoes.
[37:29.25]Please just relax and watch me hammer nails in.
[37:33.47]Crack the nail.
[37:38.98]This is only a question for the assholes.
[37:46.04]OK.
[37:47.58]So.
[37:50.49]Why don't you use a turn signal?
[37:53.45]And we'll get some options here.
[37:56.19]Option one, I just don't care.
[37:59.96]Option... Shit.
[38:13.49]Okay, option one, I just don't care.
[38:16.05]Option two is... Like,
[38:20.36]because I don't know like what why else would you not do it I okay option two is I forgot the option two is I forgot and option three is I don't know it's probably going to be like mind your own business or something right
[38:54.39]My card does not have them.
[38:57.05]Yeah, this is only for the assholes in the chat.
[38:58.93]Hold on, I'm going to see this.
[39:02.38]Okay, why don't you use your blinker, assholes only?
[39:04.78]I don't care, I forgot, I hate you, or shut the fuck up.
[39:07.88]No, you can't give that as a poll answer because everyone's going to click that.
[39:23.16]Yeah, more people that clicked on the asshole poll clicked on that one.
[39:28.65]But here's the thing, 7% said, I don't care.
[39:31.33]I think that's the real number.
[39:34.07]I think that those are truthful people, and I appreciate your honesty.
[39:39.48]Because it's definitely, I don't care.
[39:45.80]I appreciate the honesty, I do.
[40:12.47]One of the options should have been... Hold on.
[40:15.81]One of the options should have been... I don't want someone to know I'm merging so they can try to cut me off or some weird backwards logic.
[40:25.06]Yeah, you're playing offensive defense at that point.
[40:33.12]Alright, let's do another scenario.
[40:36.30]It's a four-way stop.
[40:38.42]All four cars at each stop get there at the same time you included.
[40:43.65]You pull up.
[40:44.93]One, two, three, four across from you to the left and the right at the same exact time.
[40:50.59]What do you do in that scenario?
[40:53.92]And we're going to open this poll up to everybody, not just assholes.
[40:57.46]Do you look around, put both arms in the air, and give kind of a, go on everybody, kind of like you're conducting an orchestra.
[41:09.86]Like, oh yeah, go everybody, everybody.
[41:11.78]I can wait.
[41:14.87]Do you go first and not even care?
[41:17.29]You don't even mention it.
[41:18.07]You just go first?
[41:21.66]Or do you stare across to the person directly across from you?
[41:26.06]Make eye contact and not do anything.
[41:30.43]Like, are you like a wave, everybody?
[41:32.35]Yes, everybody.
[41:33.31]Are you a waver?
[41:34.55]An eye contact, Andy.
[41:37.80]Or do you just go?
[41:40.34]Because I know which one I am.
[41:52.36]How have I gotten worse at hitting these?
[41:53.69]I'm from Atlanta.
[42:10.57]You either merge or die here.
[42:14.65]Oh my God.
[42:19.52]welcome to driving school uh for we're going to talk about the highway yep uh well everybody knows of course you either merge or you die that's the first question on the test what do you do what do you do in Atlanta merge or die I've never been to Atlanta Atlanta drivers are crazy
[42:52.53]I want to do like a full US self kind of trip.
[42:59.07]I've never really done that before.
[43:00.16]What do I do with this little weirdo?
[43:15.62]Road trip stream?
[43:16.93]No, I don't think I'd want to stream it.
[43:19.67]I don't really do very much IRL stuff.
[43:39.68]Do not go to Texas.
[43:45.98]I've actually never been to Texas.
[43:47.84]I've wanted to go.
[43:48.46]I know a lot of people that live there.
[43:50.64]Can I please get this right?
[44:01.42]I gotta get a bug.
[44:02.22]Those bugs are worth like 300 now.
[44:14.50]Let me wait for a bug.
[44:15.18]Because they're worth so much now.
[44:21.67]Yeah, I'm on mouse and keyboard.
[44:29.39]Not gonna spawn.
[44:33.15]Of course you spawn when I don't care.
[44:34.41]There's one up there.
[44:54.08]You just gotta go slow.
[45:00.43]Holy shit.
[45:01.57]That's worth way more money.
[45:02.71]If you get two in a row.
[45:06.53]Soon the air is thick with it.
[45:08.37]Soon.
[45:12.25]Come on.
[45:12.57]Give me another one.
[45:14.17]Fuck you.
[45:15.39]I'm sorry.
[45:15.81]That was vulgar.
[45:21.53]Will you miss asshole drivers when they're self-driving cars?
[45:25.21]No.
[45:30.45]But what if the computers are assholes?
[45:39.47]Are we going to program the self-driving cars to be like shitheads to make it more realistic?
[45:44.33]I didn't get one bug this whole time.
[45:57.24]I just saw one right here.
[46:05.59]There we go.
[46:09.11]Alright, 684.
[46:12.70]Different cars would be more rude.
[46:13.96]Yeah, they would be.
[46:21.62]I do not remember what our lives looked like before this.
[46:24.03]Okay, am I?
[46:28.73]Should I do something else?
[46:30.57]Better planks.
[46:33.79]Perfect nail streak.
[46:34.57]More valuable.
[46:35.17]Increases odds of cash plank.
[46:36.65]Add cash plank value.
[46:39.26]Better wood.
[46:41.72]Better hammer.
[46:47.48]That's all I can afford right now.
[46:50.80]Let's go.
[46:56.99]B&W car computers will be huge assholes.
[47:01.86]I feel like that'd be kind of fun to have self-driving cars actually have personalities.
[47:10.52]That would turn into a selling point.
[47:11.86]Hold on.
[47:12.40]Which way is it going to go?
[47:18.15]Like, I'm just saying this is hypothetical.
[47:21.23]You know, at BMW, our cars are all assholes.
[47:24.01]That's like a Saturday Night Live sketch.
[47:28.99]I'm doing like an SNL skit.
[47:40.95]That'd be kind of cool, though.
[47:42.95]We have proprietary software that, like, our... Like, our self-driving truck, like, pickup truck, understands, like, I don't know, like, the halls and farming and equipment.
[48:00.14]It can talk to you about, like, the equipment in the truck.
[48:06.02]The other cars wouldn't do it.
[48:07.82]They would have a patent on it.
[48:09.34]They would own the IP for it.
[48:17.45]There you go.
[48:25.86]Would you be the voice for it, like AI?
[48:27.66]Gonna pay me a fucking million dollars here.
[48:32.38]1.5 million, that's right.
[48:52.51]There we go.
[48:52.81]That was 150 bucks.
[49:04.64]Shit.
[49:06.20]Too bad.
[49:15.12]Nice. 250.
[49:18.52]I actually like this game.
[49:19.32]This game is kind of fun.
[49:21.02]For $3, I like this game.
[49:22.72]It's fun.
[49:32.16]I'm going to get $1,300.
[49:40.66]Does that count?
[49:45.14]Not a streak, but it counts as it sounds again.
[49:52.53]What was wrong with that?
[49:54.07]Oh, shut up.
[49:54.57]Are you building Noah's Ark?
[50:07.15]Uh.
[50:10.97]And all I got is a slingshot.
[50:18.57]Break down the walls of Jericho.
[50:25.61]I missed that.
[50:38.48]VeggieTales?

[52:14.41]What is happening in this freaking game, dude?
[52:27.31]I don't know what's happening.
[52:32.81]You have to be gentle.
[52:36.11]I got 300 bucks.
[52:36.61]Shut up.
[52:39.88]A lot of you guys need to just... A lot of you guys need to just sit down and relax and... Never mind, I was going to just sing the thing again.
[52:54.48]That's another fucking 150.
[52:55.68]This is a big round.
[53:14.29]Oh, yuck!
[53:27.70]You gonna do a face reveal?
[53:28.80]No, never.
[53:31.34]You are never going to know what I look like.
[53:35.28]And it's funny because all the Google images of me...
[53:38.41]are all so messed up and so different that are you ever going to know what I actually look like?
[53:56.75]How many followers do I have?
[53:57.61]I'll face reveal it.
[53:58.55]I don't know, 100 million followers.
[54:08.52]I saw the bug.
[54:16.89]I've actually been doing pretty well.
[54:29.35]Bug.
[54:33.46]No.
[54:41.00]Remember the 1 million stream when everybody started unfollowing?
[54:45.06]That's the funny laugh out loud thing to do.
[54:47.36]I'm going to be able to upgrade almost everything.
[55:03.54]One more.
[55:04.68]Ah, damn it.
[55:06.96]Okay.
[55:10.89]More perfect hits than okay hits.
[55:12.49]That's getting better.
[55:13.11]$12 in gains?
[55:17.20]Ooh, hold on.
[55:23.48]Turn on follow alerts.
[55:25.81]No.
[55:26.01]Alright, what do I actually want here?
[55:40.86]Better hand.
[55:41.52]Alright, that should be even better.
[55:46.88]Good.
[55:47.64]Okay, let's keep going.
[55:48.65]I'm into it.
[55:49.13]I'm going to beat this whole game.
[56:02.89]Nice.
[56:03.15]Alright, let's load this up.
[56:12.24]I'm going to start raking in mad cash now.
[56:14.88]Times three.
[56:21.50]Already at 1500.
[56:22.80]What's PB?
[56:23.28]120.
[56:28.43]Oh, it sucks when you see that happen.
[57:01.77]Good, I can get it back.
[57:03.19]Times five.
[57:03.71]Let's go.
[57:04.03]This is the new hot game everybody's playing?
[57:08.89]Might be.
[57:12.72]I know what I saw.
[57:13.48]Hold on.
[57:13.92]Quiet.
[57:19.14]You piece of shit.
[57:20.22]Who talked?
[57:21.50]Did you talk?
[57:23.99]You talked.
[57:24.55]I saw somebody talk.
[57:36.91]Any moment now.
[57:38.57]God, I can feel it.
[57:39.21]It's nearly here.
[58:04.46]These are hard to do.
[58:10.32]$23, that's it.
[58:11.26]These things suck.
[58:17.15]Alright, shh.
[58:23.59]There we go, 150.
[58:24.03]There we go, times 6.
[58:40.69]I hate this game.
[58:46.31]How come I'm so rude?
[58:49.74]I am a reflection.
[58:51.02]Hold on.
[59:03.03]Here comes a bug.
[59:05.09]I don't care.
[59:05.37]Who cares about 50 bucks when it's 250 coming up right now?
[59:11.26]Fuck yeah.
[59:20.31]I almost... I have 10,000.
[59:25.95]I am a reflection of you.
[59:29.07]This chat is a reflection.
[59:32.90]I am reflecting back the energy that I am receiving.
[59:35.38]Maybe you should think about that.
[59:51.45]Aren't we the same way?
[59:54.31]So we need to live in harmony.
[60:00.53]I'm making tons of money here.
[60:01.55]These are all perfect.
[60:08.14]You show me respect.
[60:10.74]And I'll show it back if I feel like it.
[60:12.54]If I feel like it.
[60:18.97]This is a monster score right now.
[60:29.36]Damn.
[60:32.26]12,000?
[60:40.53]Oh, I messed it up.
[60:42.17]That was stupid.
[60:42.57]Somebody asked me what my favorite saint was.
[60:46.44]And I was going to answer it.
[61:00.21]Ooh.
[61:01.25]There's a massive storm that's going to hit Vegas tonight.
[61:13.87]Like a, like a thunderstorm.
[61:22.58]St.
[61:23.10]Skibidi.
[61:25.99]Dude, I cannot believe that that shit is at Walmart.
[61:29.45]Am I just old now?
[61:30.91]I just, I don't get it.
[61:33.35]That's at Walmart.
[61:34.80]Skibidi Toilet Toys are at Walmart.
[61:39.32]I definitely, I think I may have gotten too old.
[61:40.90]I hit that threshold where I'm just too old.
[61:45.52]17k?
[61:47.06]Vinny bought one?
[61:51.26]He has one.
[61:54.31]I feel like it's kind of a relic of the weird internet.
[62:00.04]Like the internet's whole history, we are now at Skibidi Toilet.
[62:04.22]I think you kind of really need it.
[62:07.94]Husband, husband, husband, husband, husband.
[62:14.32]Thinking nails.
[62:15.71]Nails, nails again.
[62:21.41]Yep.
[62:22.53]Hand.
[62:23.13]Hand.
[62:24.75]Boards.
[62:26.23]Bugs.
[62:29.64]This is going to be awesome.
[62:30.44]Bulb.
[62:36.12]This post-modern meme society.
[62:37.88]Alright, this is going to start to be worth a lot of money.
[62:50.13]Don't fuck it up.
[62:54.32]how okay that's how's that not perfect what because I hit myself in the hand alright I'm really kind of blowing it here this is ridiculous I'm just blowing it how did I get worse with way better tools
[63:23.11]It's 1200 for one perfect with these new nails.
[63:30.82]Oh shit.
[63:31.36]Alright.
[63:32.06]Now I see how you get to a million.
[63:34.00]I get it now.
[63:50.07]I rushed it.
[63:50.83]There was no reason to rush that.
[63:54.25]I saw the bug.
[64:09.03]Where'd he go?
[64:18.46]If you must hit me with that hammer, please do so delicately.
[64:29.13]1200?
[64:30.37]Jeez, man.
[64:31.21]What is that?
[64:31.61]There's something under the deck.
[64:32.67]It's going to be horrible.
[64:35.71]Is it invisible?
[64:38.41]It's an invisible little one.
[64:46.68]I missed it.
[64:47.50]Shit.
[64:47.72]It's alright.
[64:56.52]Oh my god.
[64:57.20]Hold on.
[65:10.18]I get 500 by just doing a regular perfect in the first place.
[65:12.78]It's not even worth it.
[65:15.46]Might as well just get the perfects.
[65:17.34]Who cares?
[65:29.83]That was so perfect.
[65:30.71]It's not even funny.
[65:31.31]Okay.
[65:43.04]Harder than it looks.
[65:47.16]These exact sound effects are in the Fisher-Price first grade computer game.
[65:55.41]Based.
[66:10.16]If you get two perfects out of three, it should give you...
[66:13.29]No, that would remove the entire point of the whole game.
[66:22.62]Okay.
[66:24.22]Do it.
[66:30.94]Here we go.
[66:41.63]There we go.
[66:51.39]Holy shit, thank God.
[66:55.17]5,000?
[67:04.70]What?
[67:05.62]If you touch the wood, it counts as a bonk?
[67:09.28]Now I'm mad.
[67:12.70]Now, now, hit me now is the time.
[67:14.08]Hello?
[67:29.09]Ah, it gave me times four.
[67:32.93]That's cool.
[67:34.61]I don't care about it.
[67:35.25]I want to keep the multiplier going.
[67:42.19]Yeah, I got 10,000.
[67:43.31]I don't care about 500 bucks right now.
[67:49.49]Fuck you.
[67:49.71]Fuck you.
[68:03.51]Times two all here, hold on.
[68:06.00]OK.
[68:06.12]Yeah, OK, OK.
[68:07.34]Yeah, OK.
[68:08.28]60,000.
[68:08.50]Alright.
[68:08.86]Seven $63,000.
[68:33.10]Big, big money.
[68:42.06]I am building decks, that's right.
[68:43.12]Alright, the hammer is maxed out.
[68:51.27]Hand is maxed out.
[68:58.15]Nails maybe?
[68:59.98]Bugs?
[69:01.64]Probably planks.
[69:08.60]Alright, this should be crazy now.
[69:11.66]It's almost time for Chrono Trigger.
[69:13.66]Almost.
[69:15.84]I'm going to finish this.
[69:19.62]I wonder how much money this is worth.
[69:20.56]It's going to be crazy.
[69:21.16]It's going to be huge.
[69:24.63]Two grand.
[69:25.73]Only two hits as well.
[69:31.51]I might get there right now.
[69:32.35]Oh fuck.
[69:45.67]Let me get a x10 multiplier.
[69:59.61]Too risky.
[70:04.23]Is it almost 10,000?
[70:04.65]Dude.
[70:04.79]x5.
[70:04.87]Let's go.
[70:25.00]Oh, shit.
[70:25.36]We're good.
[70:29.73]Let me get timestamp.
[70:30.67]It's going to be an achievement.
[70:42.69]Almost 20,000 per nail.

[71:07.26]Let's get times 15.
[71:08.58]Ah, sweet.
[71:16.48]Forget about the bugs right now.
[71:17.59]I'm on a roll.
[71:21.47]Actually, that was actual anger coming out of my throat.
[71:36.62]How am I ever going to get to a million if I can't spring together times 20?
[71:38.98]I thought I just turned the lights off.
[72:04.71]Very nice.
[72:13.39]I'll get it next round for sure.
[72:14.39]16,000.
[72:14.41]Yeah, where are the cash planks?
[72:31.74]I upgraded the boards, didn't I?
[72:32.74]Ooh, times 15.
[72:35.98]That's an achievement.
[72:37.20]Times 20.
[72:42.10]uh oh my god that's a lot but I don't care oh what the dude it was invisible that's fine I'm almost there

[73:18.40]Alright.
[73:18.74]Times 11.
[73:19.18]I think I can get every single upgrade now, right?
[73:30.77]Husband, husband, husband.
[73:33.87]Uh-huh.
[73:40.15]Nails are maxed out.
[73:41.95]Boards are maxed out.

[73:49.00]The stocks are maxed out.
[73:52.44]Every single thing has been upgraded.
[73:53.74]It's time to beat the game.
[73:54.64]Here we go.
[73:54.90]Alright, I'm going for x20.
[74:20.09]I'm going to be quiet for this because I really actually want to do it.
[74:40.77]25.
[74:43.49]It is so much easier to get perfects though, so I think it's intentional.
[74:55.98]I got the... Okay, the max upgrade should be... The light doesn't turn off anymore.
[75:09.52]Whoa.
[75:09.82]25.
[75:10.94]Can I get to 30?
[75:12.38]I don't care.
[75:25.88]Don't rush me.
[75:36.67]I'm going to get jump scared.
[75:37.49]I gotta be ready for it.
[75:38.23]There's going to be a crazy jump scare.
[75:52.72]Times 50.
[75:53.16]There's probably times 100.
[76:14.99]Times 50.
[76:15.45]Let's go.
[76:15.97]I want to see it.
[76:23.15]Don't get cocky.
[76:36.67]I'm so upset.
[76:40.26]It's invisible.
[76:41.06]I fucked everything up.
[76:42.38]I hate that one.
[76:44.42]That one sucks.
[76:48.06]Invisible dog shit.
[76:49.38]That's so dumb.
[76:51.02]Angry.
[76:51.76]Actually.
[76:52.46]Mad.
[76:53.32]Mad.
[77:03.13]I would have had times 50 and now I have to start the whole game over.
[77:21.61]I want to kill a bug.
[77:22.27]I want to see what the max bug is worth.
[77:27.43]I'll make a tea too.
[77:29.43]I'm going to make a ginger tea.
[77:31.51]That sounds great.
[77:34.01]Wait, no, no.
[77:37.39]I want a hot chocolate so bad right now.
[77:39.41]I don't know why.
[77:39.93]Alright, let's see.
[77:46.99]I'll get the bug.
[77:48.09]I want to see how much it's worth.
[77:55.61]31,000, damn.
[77:56.05]Oops.
[77:56.31]Alright, let's see.
[78:00.01]End of the game.
[78:07.68]5.8 million total.
[78:11.62]So what's the deal?
[78:15.56]Created a jointer between planks to arrange them into a deck.
[78:18.08]Thank you.
[78:18.48]I think it's the same thing as he said last time.
[78:28.25]OK, here we go.
[78:42.60]Thank you my love.
[78:43.40]Uh huh.
[78:54.19]Gonna jump into the screen.
[79:04.14]Return to life.
[79:10.51]You gotta go fast.
[79:13.41]Show leaderboard.
[79:14.21]3000.
[79:14.23]I am the 3956th best gamer in the world.
[79:38.49]Can I see anything above me?
[79:40.43]I can't seem to scroll it.
[79:49.16]Top three, top 4,000.
[79:49.90]Let's go.
[79:50.40]360 nails, 39 perfect streak, 125 perfect nails.
[79:57.70]Cool.
[80:07.84]how many people have downloaded this game that's true I don't know that's a good question I'm cool with that though there are 8 billion people in the world that's good that was fun though for $3 you can't really I mean that was nice that was fun
[80:38.81]Alright, what does Return to Life do?
[80:40.95]Endless mode.
[80:43.27]I guess you can just look at the leaderboard here.
[80:48.68]I want to see what the completion time is.
[80:52.44]171.
[80:53.06]Is that seconds?
[80:58.70]You can beat the game in two, three minutes.
[81:01.40]How is it even possible?
[81:10.12]I can see one.
[81:10.72]Is it seconds?
[81:15.65]Yeah.
[81:17.23]No.
[81:18.83]Only time spent between... Only time spent building decks is counted.
[81:23.78]Oh, so it's actually time.
[81:25.14]That's weird.
[81:27.10]Alright, cool.
[81:30.62]Let me... What does endless mode look like?
[81:33.88]Does it just never end?
[81:42.53]Yeah, I just want to see if it was a different game mode or not.
[81:49.64]Cool.
[81:52.40]We're going to move to Chrono Trigger.
[81:55.94]That was a fun one.
[81:59.34]Pick up where we left off last night.
[82:03.70]Probably play for a couple hours.
[82:05.48]I can't say exactly how long, but probably two or three hours.
[82:10.68]I'm into it.
[82:12.40]I'm going to see if I can make a cocoa though.
[82:14.22]I don't know if we, I don't think you have any, do we have any chocolate or anything?
[82:20.05]I don't think so.
[82:24.63]Let me get Chrono Trigger open.
