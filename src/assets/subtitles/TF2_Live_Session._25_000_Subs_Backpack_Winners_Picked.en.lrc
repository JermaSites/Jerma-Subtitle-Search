[00:08.55]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.69]Jeremiah here with a live TF2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.09]But before the live commentary kicks in, as you see by the title of this video, 25,000 subscribers.
[00:22.59]Thank you all so, so much.
[00:24.37]You guys all rock and freaking roll, dude.
[00:27.83]So what does that mean?
[00:28.65]That means now I have to pick three people from my Twitter to get 33% of my entire backpack.
[00:35.60]I have just done that.
[00:37.36]So please, please go check your Twitter mentions right now because I just mentioned three people.
[00:44.95]And if that's you, if you're one of those people, please direct message me on Twitter.
[00:51.57]Not on Facebook, not on YouTube.
[00:54.08]Only send me a direct message on Twitter.
[00:57.10]And in that message, please include your Steam ID.
[01:00.97]I need that.
[01:01.57]That's like the most important thing in this whole thing.
[01:05.34]But yeah, congratulations to the winners, guys.
[01:07.30]And my other announcement for 25,000 subs is, guys, I'm finally going to get a TF2 server.
[01:14.64]And it's going to actually work.
[01:16.32]There's going to be people behind it that know what they're doing.
[01:19.08]So look forward to that.
[01:20.92]Hopefully we can have some good times on there.
[01:22.58]Because I know the last server I had was a real...
[01:25.50]A real mess, and hopefully this time around that will not happen.
[01:28.88]But yeah, thank you so much, everybody.
[01:30.77]You guys are all amazing.
[01:31.93]I love every single one of you guys.
[01:34.25]Thank you for subscribing.
[01:35.65]Thank you for supporting the channel.
[01:37.37]And yeah, those of you that won, enjoy my goddamn backpack.
[01:43.43]So here comes the live commentary, guys.
[01:45.00]I had some fun with Etalyx, BoomMan61, and of course, MLC_St3alth.
[01:49.38]So I hope you enjoy the video, guys.
[01:51.52]And as data trickles in on this new TF2 server I'm getting, I will absolutely let you guys know the second I get new info.
[01:59.69]So yeah, I'll see you guys all next time.
[02:02.07]And take care, everybody.
[02:05.96]Alright dudes, Team Fortress 2 Skype sexy time party with Etalyx, Jerma, MLC_St3alth, and Xbox Ahoy.
[02:18.47]No, you're meant to say Boo.
[02:19.97]Boo, that's the one.
[02:21.11]BooMan61.
[02:23.41]I hear he's much cooler.
[02:25.47]Aw, would you hear that?
[02:28.36]Are you on blue?
[02:30.22]I'm on blue, yeah.
[02:31.88]Are you really?
[02:32.70]Oh, no.
[02:33.14]I don't know what everyone's special Steam name is on here.
[02:37.17]Alright, so right now I'm Jerma.
[02:41.43]Yeah, that's going to confuse so many people.
[02:44.79]Like, wait, why is this guy listed as... So, okay, which one am I?
[02:50.02]That's like the real... Oh, mine's already highlighted.
[02:51.70]Never mind.
[02:54.78]Who is this?
[02:55.20]Demo Nightwar, interrupted by a scout.
[03:01.49]So, Boo, who are you on Blue?
[03:03.83]Oh, I'm Flump 2012.
[03:05.17]I feel like I'm making a Dr. Seuss poem right there.
[03:09.74]Boo, who are you on Blue?
[03:12.24]Oh, I'm Flump.
[03:14.84]See, to me that sounds like a Disney movie.
[03:17.64]Like, see Flump and his friends.
[03:18.98]The new Disney Pixar.
[03:22.39]Flump 2012.
[03:22.79]Coming soon to HD DVD.
[03:28.69]Oh, God.
[03:30.35]I'm just getting... Oh, that was you.
[03:32.15]Pixar presents Flump & Co.
[03:33.81]Alright, can I just tell you... It just said Jerma and Bungo killed somebody, but it was lit up right on my screen, so I really just thought... That's confusing the hell out of me.
[03:47.94]Oh, look, there I am.
[03:51.89]Oh, jeez, that's so funny.
[03:53.31]God.
[04:00.20]Let's just switch all of our names around.
[04:06.28]Oh, here we go.
[04:09.79]Or maybe Demoknight not the best.
[04:11.75]I'm doing horrible, too.
[04:18.13]Oh, don't let him get the health.
[04:20.19]Hey, Jerma, don't let him get the health.
[04:22.81]Wait, what team is everyone on?
[04:24.21]Jerma, are you on my team?
[04:27.83]Me and you are on the same team.
[04:29.75]And then me and Boo.
[04:32.29]We're both demo men.
[04:34.29]Oh god, I have no air bombs.
[04:36.21]You guys have like four sentries and we need to blow them the fuck up.
[04:40.67]Hey, I think we're all demo men.
[04:44.29]We're just different forms of demo men.
[04:49.41]What is this guy doing?
[04:52.86]Oh god.
[04:54.38]Oh, get destroyed.
[04:57.33]I'm so scared of that Huntsman sniper.
[04:58.86]I really am.
[05:01.80]Whoa.
[05:02.36]There goes the teleporter.
[05:04.06]Hi, Bongo.
[05:05.96]Oh, hey, Jerma.
[05:06.76]Oh, jeez.
[05:08.64]I just charged right in.
[05:09.99]And there goes the sentry gun.
[05:12.95]Don't worry, there's only, like, another two.
[05:15.93]Yeah, oh, my God, we really do have so many sentry guns.
[05:18.17]It's a joke.
[05:21.64]Even worse news is that I've managed to switch team to red.
[05:25.24]Oh, come on.
[05:26.60]Everyone versus Etalyx.
[05:29.32]Hey, I found another crate.
[05:31.76]Ooh.
[05:32.30]Oh, God.
[05:33.38]Ooh, I need to open mine live on television.
[05:37.40]Okay, here we go.
[05:38.32]Oh, that scout's just dead.
[05:41.70]Oh, come on.
[05:43.26]Yes, I do have 20 crates now for anyone interested.
[05:46.46]Hell yeah.
[05:47.88]I'm gonna open mine now.
[05:49.94]Hey, will you stop talking in the chat as me?
[05:56.97]Alright, fine.
[05:57.95]I'm jumping on the bandwagon.
[06:01.91]What is this heavy doing?
[06:03.28]Oh my gosh, hold on.
[06:05.28]I'm lagging super duper good right now.
[06:06.84]I'm about to critz-krieg both of you snipers over here.
[06:11.17]Oh my god, you got the uber'd.
[06:12.63]Oh wait, this is the regular one.
[06:15.39]I thought I had Kris Krieg out.
[06:16.92]Oh my god, I have the Huntsman right now.
[06:19.32]You pretty much just uber'd like a stack of hay.
[06:21.76]There was a heavy back there, but he was just standing around, not doing anything.
[06:27.14]So I was like, forget them, I'm going to uber this sniper out here.
[06:30.55]Watch out for the scout.
[06:33.41]No, you scout bastard.
[06:38.12]There's like a floating... What is this?
[06:42.94]Come on, push the cart, Jerma.
[06:48.00]Peep is helping push the cart.
[06:49.63]Oh, look who's on our team.
[06:50.63]Shibby2012.
[06:51.15]Shibby, if you're watching, I'm so sorry about this.
[06:56.81]Shibby2012.
[06:57.35]I can't even say it.
[07:01.91]My brain doesn't work.
[07:05.62]Aw, I just hit the cart.
[07:07.41]Alright, maybe we can make a roll out of this, huh?
[07:09.75]Oh yeah.
[07:10.89]Maybe.
[07:11.69]Watch out for spies.
[07:12.63]We got two heavies out here and two medics.
[07:14.35]Jerma chibis just got a kill plus assist!
[07:18.87]What's up in that chocolate sauce?
[07:21.49]Watch out, watch out on the right, watch out on the right.
[07:24.54]I can't even hit this guy, I'm always dead.
[07:27.04]Sentry!
[07:29.46]Oh no, I missed, no.
[07:32.68]Oh, I didn't kill that sentry.
[07:33.54]Come on, heavies, take him down.
[07:35.30]Oh my god, look how many people we have on this sentry.
[07:38.04]There's a lot.
[07:41.70]Oh my god, I'm killing everyone.
[07:43.54]Good lord.
[07:45.36]And we managed to take them down steamrolling the competition.
[07:49.20]Yeah!
[07:50.22]That was unbelievable, dude.
[07:52.38]Brad, did you guys do something amazing?
[07:53.70]Good job, Chibs.
[07:56.66]Oh, you're gonna get smashed!
[07:58.78]Oh, he's got the... Oh, Spencer.
[08:01.55]No.
[08:02.15]Oh.
[08:02.85]Jerma stole the kill.
[08:04.83]Jerma.
[08:05.65]I stole everything.
[08:06.29]I'm trying to give you guys, like, healing preference, but I can't keep track of who's who.
[08:10.23]Oh, how did I miss him?
[08:14.29]Wait, heal Jerma right now.
[08:15.81]Here we go.
[08:18.19]Oh, crit rocket.
[08:19.26]Come on.
[08:20.60]Come on.
[08:22.04]Oh, no.
[08:22.56]I had, like, six heads.
[08:23.48]Oh, and spied in the back.
[08:26.06]Oh, he's trying to spawn me, too.
[08:29.11]That's fine.
[08:30.33]I got switched.
[08:31.61]Oh, that was damn.
[08:33.22]Oh, no.
[08:34.60]Shibby's on the other team.
[08:36.04]Auto balance servers for the loss.
[08:39.20]In the title of this video, it should be like, oh, like, TF2 with MLC_St3alth, Etalyx, Boo Man, and Shibby 2012.
[08:49.07]Can I just tell you right now, dude, I keep thinking you're a spy.
[08:52.79]I keep checking you, and oh, my God.
[08:56.04]Like, every time I see you, I'm guaranteeing myself that you are a spy.
[09:00.41]Oh, wait, that's not me.
[09:01.17]Oh, wait, that's... Oh, no.
[09:02.89]Oh, hold on.
[09:05.11]So funny.
[09:06.81]I think we're gonna win.
[09:08.65]Are we gonna win?
[09:09.31]Oh, no.
[09:10.67]Is this gonna happen?
[09:11.51]I'm jumping around like a prof. Flying out of nowhere.
[09:15.29]Oh, that medic.
[09:18.27]Gotta get that medic.
[09:19.36]Yeah, yeah, I'm on blue.
[09:22.50]Oh, fool.
[09:23.62]Are you on our team now?
[09:25.60]Could this be the end of the story?
[09:26.72]Coming down the stairs!
[09:27.40]Coming down the stairs!
[09:28.02]Pyro!
[09:29.46]Oh, shit, mate.
[09:30.72]No!
[09:33.08]Push it!
[09:34.00]Push it!
[09:36.18]Oh, no!
[09:37.00]I don't wanna be here when it blows up!
[09:38.60]No!
[09:38.88]Yes!
[09:40.22]I fell down the pipe.
[09:42.49]Oh, yeah.
[09:43.11]That should not even count as a kill for you, Boo.
[09:46.29]You didn't kill me.
[09:47.21]Oh, look!
[09:47.57]You threw Jurati on me, and I committed suicide.
[09:51.07]Hey, at least I made it onto the top of the scoreboard twice.
[09:54.94]As two different accounts.
