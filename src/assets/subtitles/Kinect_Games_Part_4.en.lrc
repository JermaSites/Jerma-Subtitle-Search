[00:01.08]Stop punching me.
[00:03.42]Don't punch me.
[00:07.64]Don't punch me.
[00:08.28]Hello.
[00:12.84]Hello, how are you?
[00:14.46]Good to see you again.
[00:20.85]Get him.
[00:28.49]I got a little froggy in my throat.
[00:31.48]Trying to get rid of them.
[00:37.09]I can't.
[00:37.51]It's still there.
[00:38.49]Why?
[00:40.39]You're a noisy streamer.
[00:41.57]Hold on.
[00:42.07]This is why I've been sitting here clearing my throat for like five-
[01:01.40]Okay.
[01:03.52]I'm back.
[01:05.74]That took long enough.
[01:08.70]Today, from the title of the stream, we're going to be playing Connect again.
[01:13.73]We're going back to it.
[01:16.17]We're going to start with one of the most popular fucking frog in my throat.
[01:23.86]We're going to start with one of the most popular frogs.
[01:27.57]The guy that goes, hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime girl.
[01:31.03]I don't even know what his name is.
[01:32.99]He's probably the most popular frog.
[01:36.45]Right?
[01:37.83]Slippy Toad?
[01:40.51]Who's the most famous frog ever?
[01:43.07]Oh, Kermit the Frog, right.
[01:44.67]Don't turn off my 360.
[01:45.23]What are you talking about?
[01:46.25]If you're having trouble, turn off the 360.
[01:47.50]No, don't turn off my 360.
[01:48.34]Okay, we're good.
[01:52.02]I thought my 360 just almost auto-powered down.
[01:59.32]Alright, hi.
[02:00.01]I'm just gonna- I don't- here, look.
[02:02.73]I have to do this so I can get out of the fucking way.
[02:05.23]We're starting.
[02:06.89]Hi.
[02:07.73]Oh.
[02:09.47]It's screaming at me.
[02:10.75]I got my wireless Bluetooth headphones!
[02:22.02]Streamer alert?
[02:22.68]What's going on with the hair?
[02:30.41]And, uh, I don't know, okay.
[02:31.23]I don't, my lighting in my room sucks.
[02:36.31]And this camera sucks.
[02:39.31]It's a horrible combo.
[02:40.37]I have one recessed light right here that beams down an interrogation light.
[02:45.64]And then I have, like, one of those Walmart Logitech webcams.
[02:50.48]All of them suck.
[02:53.32]Wait, hold on, did you see my hands?
[02:57.87]Even the expensive Logitech webcams, they're all fucking terrible.
[03:01.43]What the fuck?
[03:04.05]And they have like, oh, the Logitech C29, the C40, the C920, the C, the C. What are all these fucking webcams that all are terrible?
[03:14.61]Why do they all look like this?
[03:18.68]Anyways.
[03:20.86]Anyways.
[03:26.92]I'm still in a fucking really weird mood.
[03:29.91]It didn't leave from yesterday.
[03:33.87]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.
[03:36.05]I think it's like when the weather gets like a little better and nicer.
[03:41.28]Like it's a reverse like full moon.
[03:44.40]I like get more weird as like the spring comes in.
[03:47.80]I'm like a fucking flower.
[03:50.84]Anyways, we're gonna play Connectimals right now.
[03:55.32]We gotta test something first though.
[03:56.72]Where are you?
[03:57.12]There you are.
[03:57.94]You ready?
[03:58.22]I'm gonna put my finger up.
[04:04.54]Ready?
[04:05.84]One!
[04:07.50]One!
[04:08.36]One!
[04:09.67]That's not right.
[04:18.31]It's a little delayed.
[04:19.73]I gotta go more delayed, right?
[04:21.49]Well, here's the problem.
[04:22.15]It's delayed from me to the Kinect.
[04:24.85]And then it's delayed from you to the stream.
[04:32.69]See myself, then it goes.
[04:33.57]See myself, then it goes.
[04:34.51]Alright, I gotta delay it a little more.
[04:35.99]Hold on.
[04:38.11]It's a double delay, Andy.
[04:39.29]I know.
[04:40.81]Why is my room red?
[04:41.84]750 delayed.
[04:44.14]Try that.
[04:53.77]Here we go, ready?
[04:54.19]Pretty good.
[05:01.83]One.
[05:03.05]Sweep.
[05:04.59]Sweep.
[05:06.33]Sweep.
[05:07.99]Sweep.
[05:09.61]Sweep.
[05:11.32]A little more, 800.
[05:11.74]Need a little more.
[05:15.72]Full power, 800.
[05:20.12]Get it to 800 power.
[05:25.40]Try that.
[05:33.07]Sweep.
[05:37.73]Why do people cast like this?
[05:38.87]Like when they cast spells?
[05:39.75]Just go like that.
[05:41.23]You ever think about that?
[05:42.17]In every like RPG.
[05:44.27]In every fucking fantasy thing.
[05:46.09]Why do they have to do weird cast?
[05:48.07]Just fucking point and say fireball.
[05:50.59]Why is it like... FIRE!
[05:53.09]No, just go...
[05:56.14]It's so much easier.
[05:56.96]Fireball!
[06:00.84]I go like this.
[06:03.39]That's fucking stupid.
[06:04.23]What were we doing?
[06:05.63]Alright.
[06:08.61]Sweep.
[06:10.67]Sweep.
[06:12.49]Go.
[06:14.39]Yes.
[06:15.99]I think we're good.
[06:16.45]You guys ready?
[06:17.88]Because it's cool.
[06:21.44]Did my belly button just come off?
[06:27.13]Alright.
[06:30.89]You ready?
[06:31.13]You ready?
[06:34.04]Everybody?
[06:36.20]I'm just fucking connected up.
[06:39.00]This is Connectimals.
[06:40.66]This game's probably not good.
[06:43.96]Here we go.
[06:45.89]I'm calibrated.
[06:51.21]Ah, welcome to the world of Connectimals.
[06:53.45]Did Peter Marlowe make this game?
[06:56.99]Peter Molyneux made this game, right?
[06:59.06]Oh no, he made another one with like a little boy.
[07:02.94]What happened?
[07:03.86]What happened?
[07:05.92]Oh.
[07:07.26]I just like freaked out.
[07:09.20]What happened?
[07:09.64]What just happened?
[07:17.04]What's going on?
[07:20.90]Wave to connect.
[07:28.63]Please face the sender, sensor.
[07:33.81]Need a controller.
[07:34.59]What the fuck are you doing?
[07:35.75]What?
[07:36.33]What did I press?
[07:37.13]Hold on.
[07:39.03]What did I press?
[07:45.56]Oh, it wants, sign in with your email.
[07:47.60]Oh, fuck you.
[07:49.12]I don't even, I have no idea what that is.
[07:50.26]Holy shit, I have abso-fucking-lutely no idea what this is.
[07:59.25]I have no idea what my password is.
[08:02.29]I'm just gonna be David instead.
[08:03.59]Yeah, who cares.
[08:07.61]I have absolutely no idea.
[08:12.57]Alright, David.
[08:13.33]We're gonna be logging in as David.
[08:16.69]He doesn't have Xbox Live.
[08:18.99]It's like my little brother.
[08:20.01]Okay, let's go.
[08:22.21]We're David.
[08:28.46]So this one's now with bears.
[08:29.78]Why'd it have to be so far away?
[08:35.95]Alright.
[08:38.09]I'm just getting closer.
[08:40.69]I don't care.
[08:41.75]Wait.
[08:41.87]That's Invader Zim!
[08:43.45]That's Invader Zim!
[08:59.76]Uhh... What's his name?
[09:02.51]I know it.
[09:04.31]Richard... Richard what?
[09:05.91]What's his name?
[09:08.71]Oh, I don't care what's signing in.
[09:09.81]Fuck off.
[09:14.38]Richard Horvath, there he is.
[09:22.82]Wait, I'm not David though.
[09:25.04]Oh shit, I just stole David's identity.
[09:29.25]Guest.
[09:33.81]Select bear adventure.
[09:35.53]Um, I think I don't want us to do regular connectables.
[09:38.60]I don't like the way this camera is, by the way.
[09:43.86]It's a bad camera position.
[09:44.88]We need to shrink this.
[09:46.78]What the fuck did I just do?
[09:48.04]What did I do?
[10:02.72]Did I pick Bear Adventure?
[10:04.10]Oh, there they are!
[10:14.14]Both dead.
[10:20.18]I picked Bear Adventure.
[10:21.36]Should I do the first one first?
[10:27.10]Why is my room red?
[10:28.92]We have visitors.
[10:30.28]Go, get back up to the circle.
[10:32.22]I'll meet you up there.
[10:33.43]Great.
[10:34.19]It looks like everyone is here.
[10:39.34]It's so wonderful to have a visitor you don't look like a pirate you must be an explorer.
[10:42.74]Yes.
[10:42.86]Well, you've certainly discovered something here Welcome to the island
[11:02.01]You little fucking weirdo.
[11:02.99]I didn't want to do this one.
[11:05.82]I wanted to do the regular game.
[11:07.20]Should I go back?
[11:07.68]Okay.
[11:31.70]Should I do the bear adventure?
[11:33.05]Does it matter?
[11:33.73]Which one's better?
[11:38.93]What?
[11:39.83]The bonding circle.
[11:42.99]What?
[11:44.85]Go play the default game.
[11:45.79]Alright, I'll play this for five minutes, and then I'm going back.
[11:51.32]Oh, this is back when, like, loading screens were a majority of, like, the 12 hours of the game.
[11:55.78]It was, like, four hours.
[11:58.02]Oh, which one?
[11:58.58]Oh!
[12:00.18]But who should I pick?
[12:00.88]Okay, I could panda bear?
[12:02.08]I don't, oh no, I don't want the panda bear though.
[12:06.46]Hold out your hand and swipe it in front of you.
[12:08.72]Hmm, that's it.
[12:10.08]Now if you swipe with your left hand, you can look at the cubs to your left.
[12:28.37]Why can't I just turn my body?
[12:31.91]Alright, so we got... That's... We got brown bear.
[12:36.96]Black bear.
[12:37.50]Alright, hold on.
[12:39.44]Grizzly bear.
[12:40.06]Grizzly bear is very cute.
[12:44.54]Black bear.
[12:45.28]Black bears are like little dogs.
[12:46.50]Oh, no panda.
[12:47.04]Oh, no panda or polar bear.
[12:48.12]Don't these... Aren't these mean...
[12:59.50]This fucking Kinect is stupid.
[13:04.52]I guess we have a fucking polar bear.
[13:07.00]Oh, he's such a good boy.
[13:08.66]He's so cute.
[13:08.98]Step left and right.
[13:28.25]I don't want a pet there.
[13:29.63]What the fuck?
[13:32.36]No!
[13:32.80]Good.
[13:40.88]We can go somewhere else.
[13:42.34]What's this one?
[13:42.84]Honey bear?
[13:43.28]A poo bear?
[13:45.50]A cinnamon bear?
[13:46.62]Hold on.
[13:47.92]I need to see the cinnamon bear.
[13:55.22]Oh, this is the bear that's on all the cereal boxes.
[13:57.00]I like this one.
[14:04.87]Where are you?
[14:06.69]Oh, he looks like a little fox!
[14:17.67]I'm like down here.
[14:18.43]Down here, he just like shits in my hand.
[14:21.07]Oh, oh!
[14:23.43]It's okay.
[14:24.14]It's alright.
[14:25.57]A cinnamon bear?
[14:27.21]Just promise me you won't name it cinnamon.
[14:30.03]They really don't like that.
[14:32.63]Yes.
[14:32.87]Cinnamon bear.
[14:34.63]Grandma, what the fuck?
[14:36.98]What?

[14:44.02]Do you want to give your new friend a name right now?
[14:47.92]Yes.
[14:51.94]Let's rename him.
[14:52.52]Snuggles!
[14:52.84]The first of his name!
[14:53.58]Snuggles the bear!
[14:54.02]Dryer sheet bear!
[14:54.56]Dryer sheet.
[14:55.04]Do I have to press the button?
[15:21.36]Dryer sheet bear.
[15:24.41]Oh, I like that.
[15:26.03]Say it again.
[15:27.09]See if your cub likes it too.
[15:31.25]Dryer sheet bear.
[15:37.87]Oh, I like that.
[15:39.49]Say it again.
[15:40.56]See if your cub likes it too.
[15:44.64]Dryer sheet bear.
[15:48.74]Oh, wonderful thing.
[15:52.26]I have to say that every time?
[15:54.70]He loves it.
[16:06.47]Would you like to see a picture or something to identify this?
[16:08.61]Scan a picture?
[16:10.63]No.
[16:13.33]Like, on my fucking printer?
[16:14.95]Like, I have to go scan an image and, like, upload it?
[16:28.50]Scan your face.
[16:29.30]Oh.
[16:33.71]What do you even do in this game?
[16:34.99]Lawrence?
[16:35.91]What are these houses?
[16:36.55]You don't do anything.
[16:37.37]You don't do anything.
[16:38.15]You just walk around.
[16:59.14]I assume you're here for the key?
[17:00.94]Also known as the prism?
[17:03.10]The crystal key?
[17:04.42]Not ringing any bells, huh?
[17:07.46]Well, they called a lot of them.
[17:09.74]One thing was clear.
[17:11.08]They believed it was a key to a hidden kingdom.
[17:14.38]That's what the captains, Fiddler and Blackwood, that is, went searching for.
[17:19.10]That was all a long, long time ago.
[17:22.20]Sounds a bit mad, doesn't it?
[17:24.20]Crystal keys and secret kingdoms.
[17:27.61]Here we are.
[17:28.81]This is my home.
[17:30.63]Oh, your house.
[17:31.49]Okay.
[17:31.87]Let's stop here.
[17:33.37]I want to show you... Where's my house?
[17:40.05]Oh, he already got in.
[17:42.19]It's kind of cozy, don't you think?
[17:45.44]Take a look at this.
[17:47.00]Two of the greats.
[17:50.42]Those are the original, like, connectables?
[17:52.50]That's me sitting on Captain Fiddler's shoulder.
[17:55.26]My favorite spy in the whole world.
[17:57.96]He was a great man.
[17:58.88]Fearless, brilliant, and a real friend.
[18:02.85]Oh, and that, that's Captain Blackwood.
[18:05.69]With Bumbler.
[18:07.25]An annoying little fellow.
[18:08.49]I have to drink my coffee.
[18:09.65]Captain Blackwood picked us up in the jungles of Borneo.
[18:11.89]We traveled together for a few months before Bumbler and I were at each other's throats.
[18:16.79]Fireball!
[18:17.45]Oh!
[18:17.57]What's his name?
[18:18.17]Dryer Sheet Bear?
[18:18.78]What the heck are you doing over here, you goofball?
[18:40.44]A private journal from Captain Blackwood.
[18:43.41]Oh, my goodness.
[18:44.77]Maybe it explains what happened to the captains.
[18:48.20]It's been three weeks since we landed on Mira.
[18:51.20]At first, I couldn't believe me eyes when we found an island, but half a day's sail from Lemuria.
[18:57.42]It's curious that we've never seen it before.
[19:00.90]And probably accounted for the vast fog that envelops it.
[19:05.47]And when we found me old friend Lawrence Fiddler and little Lena here all alone, well, you can imagine my surprise.
[19:13.92]Oh, how's this for method?
[19:14.76]Are you good?
[19:15.20]I'm just- I'm just- I'm antsy!
[19:16.70]I wanna connect!
[19:18.13]You ever see anybody in your life that has this much of an expressive hand?
[19:40.44]As on Lemuria, the bears are just cubs.
[19:43.85]Well, I have some theories about that.
[19:47.15]Up on the cliff is an abandoned fort.
[19:49.59]It was built long ago by some band of forgotten pirates.
[19:54.16]Only the remains of their ship are scattered across the beaches.
[19:58.55]Just supposing.
[20:00.15]But what if they never left the island and found the entrance to the Hidden Kingdom?
[20:04.76]How?
[20:05.62]Tomorrow, all Fiddler and I will travel to... By the way, these jeans are way too small for me now.
[20:11.36]I'm like a fat guy.
[20:12.68]I gained like 20 pounds.
[20:14.00]...on the island for months already when Captain Blackwood arrived.
[20:17.67]This bear can read?
[20:18.79]The captain set out to explore the island.
[20:22.19]This is a bear that can read?
[20:23.61]Holy shit.
[20:24.19]I'm not sure what happened to them, but they never came back.
[20:28.43]Where's my bear food?
[20:29.48]I want to, like, drop the bear food.
[20:30.62]I don't want to do that.
[20:32.24]I want to feed the bear.
[20:35.90]Is it... Okay, is it kind of weird?
[20:38.32]I feel like this is, like...
[20:57.88]Bears are not like dogs.
[20:59.06]They're not like, oh, yep, yep, like, come get me, my friend.
[21:02.62]Like, this is weird, right?
[21:04.44]Like, why is a bear acting like it's a puppy that I just bought from, like, like a little small puppy?
[21:14.00]They'll kill you, right?
[21:15.48]Yeah, like... Well, a baby won't.
[21:20.14]I think your cub smells the fresh sea air.
[21:23.27]Hmm.
[21:24.94]Fort Topaz is where our crew stayed while we were repairing our ship.
[21:28.56]Kids game?
[21:28.98]We cleaned up the old pirate fort.
[21:30.64]I know.
[21:31.00]We had so much fun exploring and playing games together.
[21:34.18]Look, he's so cute.
[21:35.24]Oh, what a sweetie.
[21:37.08]He's acting like a puppy.
[21:38.06]I think your cub wants to play.
[21:39.70]Slobbery, but cute.
[21:42.46]This is like a dachshund puppy.
[21:44.04]Let's be on the lookout for clues about what might have happened to the captain.
[21:47.84]It looks like your bear cub has other ideas.
[21:50.83]Alright, let's play.
[21:53.17]Alright, let's play.
[21:54.43]How do- what do I do?
[21:55.03]Friar Sheep Bear!
[21:58.55]Friar Sheep Bear!
[22:03.08]They've gone bipedal.
[22:03.98]This is where they fucking- this is- I saw this movie, they take over humanity.
[22:09.02]Friar Sheep Bear!
[22:09.78]Hey!
[22:11.68]Go!
[22:12.26]Oh, what'd you get?
[22:12.82]Is it a whistle?
[22:21.12]So, are you two ready to start learning some tricks?
[22:24.48]Yes.
[22:25.72]Let's start easy.
[22:27.23]Jump in the air.
[22:37.37]When you do a trick, your bear will copy you.
[22:40.15]It's as easy as that.
[22:42.36]Now spin in place.
[22:43.94]Careful you don't get too dizzy.
[22:50.15]Oh, it knows!
[22:50.96]I can't do that.
[22:51.64]Alright.
[22:52.14]Can I do like the Backstreet Boys thing?
[23:17.46]Alright, fine.
[23:18.06]He's getting angry.
[23:19.10]Alright, I'll be dead.
[23:19.92]I'm dead.
[23:20.70]I'm dead.
[23:22.48]I'm dead down here.
[23:24.40]I'm dead down here!
[23:25.42]Okay, what about this?
[23:41.84]From time to time, little challenges like this one will pop up.
[23:45.42]Completing a challenge will reward you with discovery points.
[23:48.80]The more of these points you get, the more secrets you'll discover around the island.
[23:53.53]Leave me and my friend alone.
[23:58.15]Give me a hug.
[23:58.81]What do I do?
[24:03.45]I'm gonna do that.
[24:04.79]Teach him look at me.
[24:10.29]Lie down.
[24:10.85]Look.
[24:11.05]Lie down.
[24:11.51]Lie down.
[24:14.01]Down.
[24:14.43]Lie down.
[24:16.05]Lie down.
[24:17.41]Good.
[24:18.38]Good.
[24:19.12]Dryer sheet bear.
[24:20.02]Good.
[24:20.50]Dryer sheet bear.
[24:21.34]Up.
[24:23.26]Up, up, up, up, up.
[24:24.94]I don't want to do that again.
[24:34.55]I'm going to puke.
[24:42.95]We get money?
[24:43.79]Patrick's star jump.
[24:49.32]Alright, let's do this like a two-year-old.
[24:53.82]Yay!
[25:19.67]Oh, a ball.
[25:20.71]A juggling ball.
[25:22.09]Do you come from circus folk?
[25:28.43]Use your left and right hand to knock back the balls between you and your cub.
[25:34.51]Like this.
[25:35.09]You got to learn from the master.
[25:37.04]Fantastic.
[25:40.58]You figured it out.
[25:43.38]I think I'll leave you two alone for a while.
[25:49.60]By the way, first one to fucking blink loses.
[25:52.70]How long can you go?
[25:54.78]I feel like this is the kind of shit that was like on Jimmy Fallon.
[26:03.28]10 years ago or something.
[26:06.33]Oh, this guy plays jungle with his bear!
[26:20.69]He's juggling with his bear.
[26:22.65]Jimmy Fallon is not this good.
[26:24.73]Is it a... Yes!
[26:25.15]Oh, that was a key.
[26:49.83]The landmine?
[26:50.93]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[26:53.01]What is wrong with you, dude?
[26:54.29]It's a... I was supposed to take a sip out of that.
[26:57.23]Oh, juggle challenge!
[26:58.33]Okay.
[27:19.69]Pop as many bubbles as you can while juggling.
[27:21.93]I'm ready for this one.
[27:29.28]Oh, you and me.
[27:39.96]Are these frogs?
[27:40.93]This is wicked fucked up!
[27:45.45]I told you the bears were evil!
[28:15.16]Didn't even miss one.
[28:18.44]Didn't even miss one frog.
[28:24.67]This is terrible.
[28:34.13]I think this is bad.
[28:37.33]This is not a bad game.
[28:41.53]Did I pick- did I pick the ro- I picked the expansion?
[28:43.79]Did I play the regular game?
[28:46.11]Do you do this in the regular game?
[28:56.02]You- you over there, you over there, you over there, I'm not gonna use you in the back row!
[29:03.98]You open the field in the front row!
[29:07.64]He hates this game?
[29:08.50]I mean, I- I don't-
[29:21.70]Don't worry, we're just getting started.
[29:22.92]We're just getting warmed up with connectables.
[29:24.72]HD.
[29:26.90]I got the Fable Connect game back here.
[29:30.04]Fable Connect.
[29:32.79]That one's supposed to have magical fucking spells.
[29:43.55]This is just an excuse to get parents to get their kids to move their fucking arms around.
[29:49.29]They think they're playing with the bear cub, but they're just exercising.
[29:52.31]That's a gold medal!
[30:13.97]Speedrun?
[30:14.29]Skip it, skip, skip, skip, skip!
[30:15.59]Ah, I had a chance.
[30:16.61]I had one opportunity to get the hell out of here.
[30:19.54]Oh, by the way... We also have... More movies to make.
[30:45.62]What do you think about that?
[30:50.74]Alright, let's play.
[30:52.06]Let's go.
[30:52.64]Let's go?
[30:52.90]Next game now.
[30:53.42]Hold on.
[30:53.66]It has been 30 minutes.
[30:54.86]How have I been here for 30 minutes?
[30:56.38]Open Toy Box!
[31:20.09]You want to do it?
[31:22.79]You want to do it on camera so you can tell that I'm not fucking faking it?
[31:31.44]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, fuck yeah!
[31:52.35]Go get it!
[31:55.21]Who has the ball?
[31:58.55]No, I'm not doing juggle.
[31:59.27]I'm not doing juggle.
[31:59.87]This game sucks!
[32:02.35]Should I move on?
[32:09.83]Oh, it does?
[32:10.39]I thought this was like one of the New York Times bestseller Kinect game.
[32:13.89]Did I mess it up?
[32:18.76]Don't leave.
[32:19.94]Don't leave dryer sheet bare.
[32:23.32]Is this a normie game?
[32:26.84]Are, like, eight-year-olds normies?
[32:28.71]What are you talking about?
[32:30.09]Wait, what?
[32:33.33]Ah, yes.
[32:33.87]Guess it's a normie game.
[32:35.25]All those, like, seven-year-olds.
[32:37.09]Those seven-year-old normies.
[32:44.75]Seven-year-old doesn't barely know how to tie shoes.
[32:47.58]What do you mean?
[32:49.06]Bro, juggle with him.
[32:49.98]Fine.
[32:51.99]Alright, I'm gonna put in the Fable game.
[32:55.28]This is actually a cereal box game for kids.
[33:01.06]Let me do the rubber chicken.
[33:04.45]Let me do the rubber chicken, hold on.
[33:11.49]Can we fucking record that?
[33:13.14]I don't know how you can do that.
[33:30.77]Xbox record that Hold out your arm to the bottom right
[33:51.74]Not loud enough.
[33:52.52]Alright, hold on.
[33:53.48]I see a sandwich right here.
[33:54.25]There's, like, some sandwich.
[33:56.41]Let's at least, like, do the thing.
[33:57.43]Let me at least, like, give him a bath, right?
[33:59.23]That's, like, fun.
[33:59.94]That'll be, like, fun.
[34:01.42]Here we go.
[34:03.00]Let's give him a bath.
[34:06.47]Cleaning is an important way of caring for your animal.
[34:09.61]If your animal gets dirty, just give it a good scrub with the cleaning brush.
[34:13.75]Remember to step left and right all over your cub's body.
[34:20.22]That is one dirty rascal.
[34:26.02]Where's the water?
[34:26.74]I'm not using any water.
[34:34.57]Wouldn't that just be dry and, like, scratchy?
[34:36.65]Alright, let me see what the other items are.
[34:44.33]I'm not done yet.
[34:44.89]Dryer Sheet Bear!
[34:46.51]Oh.
[35:04.26]Step left or right to change the direction of your throw.
[35:10.77]I killed him!
[35:13.85]He hit her in the face!
[35:19.56]It bounced off his nose.
[35:21.66]I'm trying to hit her.
[35:22.46]That's bad too.
[35:27.50]Longest throw?
[35:28.38]Oh, yeah.
[35:29.72]I'll show you long throws.
[35:33.55]Good boy!
[35:35.45]I'm under the ocean!
[35:36.21]Hey, hey, look, look, look, look!
[35:46.09]Look, look, look, look, look!
[35:46.95]Look what I got!
[35:47.59]Look what I got!
[36:15.73]Shit, this is so not synced up correctly.
[36:23.40]I'm doing it and then it's happening.
[36:24.64]Next game, next game.
[36:31.17]Wait, one more item.
[36:46.41]No dryer sheet, bear.
[36:50.06]Okay.
[36:54.16]No dryer sheet, bear.
[36:55.07]Show dryer sheet.
[37:24.67]What the fuck does he have on his head?
[37:25.83]Yes!
[37:25.97]Alright, I want to climb a tree first.
[37:27.76]Look, I got a lot of Kinect games to go through.
[37:30.46]Ugh.
[37:53.23]How do I do that?
[37:55.18]If bears love anything, it's climbing.
[37:57.66]Wow, looks like this guy's no exception.
[38:00.82]To get your bird to climb up the tree, move your hands above your head, like this.
[38:09.83]Step left and right to get a better view of your surroundings.
[38:26.87]Wait, am I on, like, a drone?
[38:33.51]Why don't you try jumping for an extra boost?
[38:38.99]If you want your bear to climb back down the tree, just crouch down, like this.
[38:43.54]He's gonna fall!
[38:48.88]Your bear will slide down the trunk.
[38:52.72]This is so stressful.
[38:57.82]Slide down.
[38:58.92]Slide down.
[38:59.86]Come down from there.
[39:00.91]Oh!
[39:01.37]His forebears.
[39:02.17]His bear.
[39:02.55]Run to old park.
[39:04.27]Oh my god.
[39:25.06]and fucking fabling.
[39:35.67]Hold on.
[39:36.15]How much was that game?
[39:47.36]Probably a lot.
[39:50.34]Or a dryer sheet there.
[40:01.61]Fuck it, Fable.
[40:09.23]I thought this would make sure your room has enough space to play.
[40:11.13]Don't look up.
[40:13.15]An anvil going to drop on my head?
[40:21.47]Webcam's too big.
[40:22.17]Turn the lights off.
[40:27.66]No, you won't be able to see me.
[40:38.36]of this is the Peter Molyneux one.
[40:44.82]Wasn't there a Peter Molyneux game where he's like- Take a seat, get comfortable and get ready for your journey.
[40:50.76]Try to sit upright and keep your legs uncrossed.
[40:57.83]For best results, place your Kinect sensor in a central position above or below your TV.
[41:12.08]You may need to sit forward in your seat if it has high arms, a low seat or a soft back.
[41:27.73]Make sure you have enough room to play.
[41:37.68]Try not to sit too close to other people or objects.
[41:42.56]You fart on me?
[41:44.66]To access the Connect Guide while playing, hold your left arm straight out to your side.
[41:50.76]Try this now to begin your journey.
[41:54.10]What?
[41:54.32]Left arm?
[42:04.73]What?
[42:19.91]Where does he want me to go?
[42:23.65]I just did that.
[42:29.95]Oh!
[42:30.13]Wait!
[42:33.27]Hold on a second.
[42:35.13]Why is resume and begin?
[42:38.39]Resume.
[42:38.95]Begin.
[42:39.27]What do you mean resume?
[42:40.72]What the fuck are you talking about?
[42:41.84]Why do you have a resume and begin button?
[42:45.76]This thing is bright green.
[42:46.92]It says resume.
[42:55.58]Oh my god!
[43:00.92]Running Connect ID.
[43:02.04]Please space the sensor.
[43:06.07]What?
[43:07.83]Go, David.
[43:23.51]You could literally torture me and I wouldn't know the password.
[43:32.21]Okay, start games.
[43:33.03]Can you see me?
[43:33.49]Am I in view?
[43:39.29]I want to get this right though, because this is an actual fucking video game.
[43:49.41]I guess it's not that bad.
[43:50.93]It's pretty close.
[43:53.75]facecam facecam hold on let me let me get let me write the face came up it looks fucking dark as hell don't touch anything I can't even I have like a fucking whole goddamn unit of like technical directors to like play a console game on your pc you gotta have like 10 monitors
[44:23.02]To stream a console game, you need to have like fucking 40 monitors.
[44:38.38]It's so dark.
[44:39.23]It's not this dark in my room.
[44:45.27]It actually is not this dark in the room.
[44:53.22]Need backlights?
[44:55.77]Move the lights.
[44:56.37]I don't have... What do you mean move the lights?
[44:57.51]I have a recessed light in my... Sensor.
[45:02.21]Turn on the sun.
[45:09.81]This shit is so annoying.
[45:11.03]Like... Why do all these... Like... Dinky little shit webcams... Need like 5,000 megawatts of light... To like be shown up on screen?
[45:26.72]You see me?
[45:30.82]Like, we can literally send a fucking, a rover to Mars.
[45:35.66]But I have to put a 5 million megawatt lamp in my face to show up on this.
[45:42.79]Without blowing, blowing the fuck out the exposure.
[45:47.41]Why?
[45:47.77]No, it ain't the window.
[45:49.95]I've had this problem for years.
[45:56.76]It's your fat ass.
[46:00.12]My ass is just like fucking huge, like blocking out the sun.
[46:05.12]Get a better camera.
[46:07.20]No, they're all like this.
[46:08.26]All webcams are like this.
[46:10.80]That's why there's a whole company, guys, that makes like streamer lights.
[46:14.56]Because they know it's like a band-aid problem.
[46:16.96]You know what I mean?
[46:17.74]I ain't getting fucking streamer lights.
[46:27.52]Hold on.
[46:29.37]That's red.
[46:32.15]Red.
[46:38.01]White balance is fucking horrible.
[46:44.04]What the hell is going on here?
[46:58.66]Where did you go?
[46:59.16]Hold on.
[47:10.85]Alright, I gotta sit back down.
[47:16.40]Perfect.
[47:17.22]What is over there?
[47:17.72]Oh, there's like a fucking toy over there.
[47:22.52]Alright, that should be good.
[47:25.00]Where did you go?
[47:25.44]The Kinect sensors are having trouble.
[47:26.26]Okay.
[47:27.10]Whoa, look at me.
[47:27.68]I'm like lit up over there.
[47:28.90]Oh yeah, remember this?
[47:30.62]Shit, you can't do it.
[47:31.26]Alright, I'm ready.
[47:33.26]Alright, start game.
[47:49.88]You guys ready for Fable?
[47:56.97]Even the greatest of journeys must begin with a single step.
[48:13.04]I completely forgot about old console games.
[48:15.86]We're obsessed with having blown out bloom on every single title that made the game run at 18 frames a second.
[48:21.99]To hide the fact that the game was ugly.
[48:23.39]Guys, remember that shit?
[48:25.75]Wow, I'm so glad we're over that.
[48:37.46]Come on!
[48:38.16]Keep the pace up!
[48:39.26]We've got a long way to go before we get home.
[48:45.29]And me?
[48:50.07]Audio desynced?
[48:58.53]That is... But I think that's the game.
[49:02.78]Not... I don't think that's, uh... I don't think that has anything to do with capturing.
[49:07.80]I believe that's just the video game.
[49:14.55]Can't wait to wash another animal with a brush.
[49:17.45]Like in 60% of every Kinect game.
[49:19.69]Come on, Saren.
[49:31.32]Come on.
[49:31.90]Come on, go.
[49:32.58]Come on.
[49:33.14]Let's go.
[49:33.96]Come on, Saren.
[49:37.08]DMT's kicking it.
[49:38.62]He's fighting fucking ghosts.
[49:40.08]Eat the horse.
[49:40.66]Oh.
[50:10.57]Come here.
[50:11.47]The convoy will be moving on soon.
[50:12.97]We better get you ready.
[50:15.33]There's a fucking brushing game.
[50:22.28]Good girl, sir.
[50:22.94]And there's a good girl.
[50:23.78]I got double brush.
[50:28.95]We're gonna get this part of the skin raw.
[50:30.97]There you are, Gabriel.
[50:32.18]Catelyn, I thought you were getting the convoy ready.
[50:34.12]You and that old mare... Let me move back.
[50:36.06]Leave me alone.
[50:36.92]You mean the triumph already left?
[50:38.12]What the fuck?
[50:38.44]What were you doing?
[50:38.94]I gotta move the mic over here.
[50:39.80]Were you distracted by the butterflies?
[50:41.82]Or were you just daydreaming about old fables?
[50:44.18]No, I was just about to get Saren ready.
[50:45.96]Look, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
[50:47.76]Does you almost need a brushing?
[50:50.01]Stop.
[50:50.37]Don't show me that.
[50:51.33]I look weird.
[50:52.73]Now get Saren harnessed up and let's get moving.
[50:55.55]Alright.
[50:56.03]I just need to get me... Now, Gabriel.
[51:05.10]Why even have that part?
[51:07.21]You so badly wanted to have the horse brushing segment.
[51:09.81]You could have opened here.
[51:11.93]You needed the horse brushing segment.
[51:14.79]We could have opened here.
[51:17.15]Open right here.
[51:20.54]I can't wait to have to hold the reins.
[51:25.64]The tribe will be well on their way by now.
[51:32.02]What do I do?
[51:33.00]Crack the reins once to make Saren trot.
[51:36.05]Once trotting, you can accelerate to a gallop by cracking the reins a second time.
[51:41.59]Okay.
[51:42.21]I'm ready.
[51:45.06]Continue.
[51:51.63]We go.
[51:56.18]I forgot to tell you, I got the special connect seat.
[52:00.01]It's connected through USB-C in the back of the Xbox.
[52:11.48]To steer right, pull the right rein towards your body and push the left rein away.
[52:16.47]To steer left, pull the left rein towards your body and push the right rein away.
[52:21.16]While steering, try to keep your hands low and make large, clear movements.
[52:25.54]Alright, we're going off a fucking cliff, I think.
[52:41.31]Hey, open your eyes.
[52:43.49]Hey, it's called steering.
[52:45.63]Try it.
[52:52.15]Oh, what are we doing?
[52:52.75]What are we up to?
[52:53.27]What are we doing?
[52:57.76]Oh, a connect seat.
[53:00.50]That's right.
[53:00.98]I forgot.
[53:01.32]It has a little launch pad.
[53:05.33]Remember they used to fucking make shit like that?
[53:06.93]They wanted it to be like that.
[53:08.14]There was, like, a vest.
[53:12.10]There was, like, a whole huge vest you could put on.
[53:15.52]That when you get, like, shot in a game, it, like, vibrated your heart.
[53:21.75]They so badly wanted you to get, like, actually hurt and shit.
[53:32.07]Hey, look at him.
[53:41.86]not doing that let me guess you were up all night reading those old books of yours again weren't you well not all into the wall into the wall no you only do the drive into the wall joke twice before it's too much all this dreaming about magic heroes stories we read when we were knee high to a hob it's got to stop we're not children anymore do I get to pick like my class and start doing Gabriel
[54:10.09]Do I have powers?
[54:10.69]Do I have a weapon?
[54:11.49]This is an insanely long ride the horse opening segment.
[54:14.23]We don't need this here.
[54:14.85]You showed me the ride on the reins.
[54:17.14]Right?
[54:17.52]This segment is far too long.
[54:38.95]Rough terrain will injure Saren unless ridden over at a trot.
[54:42.81]Oh, that's why I was getting all fucked up.
[54:44.95]So make sure you take good care of her.
[54:51.28]Easy now.
[54:52.08]Slow it down, Gabriel.
[54:54.60]There you go.
[54:56.07]Why can't you drive like this all the time?
[55:00.23]That's the way.
[55:01.59]Zarin may be old, but there's still a few miles left in the old girl.
[55:04.88]Alright, we're good.
[55:05.44]Don't listen to him, girl.
[55:07.04]He just wishes he had a horse like you.
[55:09.00]Yeah, right.
[55:10.04]That'll be it.
[55:11.14]I think that was rough terrain, but it doesn't matter.
[55:16.14]I don't think this matters.
[55:18.42]Hey, look where you're going.
[55:22.21]Except for the- except for whoever's in the back.
[55:24.91]Whoever's inside of the cart is like, oh my fucking god, I can't even drink my tea.
[55:29.69]A fast?
[55:29.85]I don't know.
[55:30.25]Over your head?
[55:56.43]I'm gonna open up the back.
[56:01.37]We're gonna go to the back of this thing and like open it up.
[56:04.07]All like the luggage is gonna be every... All the luggage is gonna be everywhere.
[56:08.51]There's gonna be like an overturned table.
[56:11.85]Okay, hold on.
[56:12.41]Did we get over?
[56:28.34]Where are we going?
[56:29.06]What happened?
[56:46.97]This segment is way too fucking long!
[56:50.15]Oh, I have four health left.
[56:56.63]Get me to the town!
[57:01.78]As you travel, you'll come across experience orbs on the road.
[57:05.54]Collecting these will allow you to purchase upgrades.
[57:08.71]Green orbs can be collected at any speed.
[57:11.09]Okay, you know when you put... You know when you put, like, a video file into, like, a Final Cut or a Premiere timeline, and you right-click it, and you just say, like, 50% playback speed?
[57:22.58]I swear to God, I feel like that a lot of devs do, like, the... Put the game in, and right-click the fucking file, and do 50% fucking playback speed.
[57:31.48]Just stretch the thing extra, like, another hour.
[57:35.54]Two hours.
[57:36.26]There's no reason.
[57:45.91]Are people afraid that if they have like a four-hour experience, not like a seven-hour experience, it's gonna be bad or something?
[57:52.68]Like I'd rather have a three-hour experience without any like fucking just stretched out timeline.
[57:58.50]And a seven-hour fucking filled with a bunch of junk.
[58:01.28]Hold your hands, why?
[58:02.05]Hold out!
[58:10.27]Sometimes I miss those days.
[58:11.93]I swear to God, people- a lot of devs and- and maybe- maybe it's both.
[58:15.99]Maybe it's like developers, reviewers, consumers.
[58:18.66]I don't know.
[58:19.90]Like the prospect of having like a good five-hour game versus like a bloated 12-hour game is- I don't understand.
[58:25.78]I'd rather have just- just cut all the bullshit out.
[58:27.52]Give me a fucking good game.
[58:31.12]That's gotta be- it's gotta be 8 to 12 hours.
[58:33.39]Why?
[58:33.63]Just make it good.
[58:35.49]It's gotta be 20- I'm sorry.
[58:39.34]It's gotta be a 28- It's gotta be a 30-hour experience.
[58:43.16]Just make it 15.
[58:43.68]Doesn't matter.
[58:45.56]Make it a good game.
[58:51.51]Only 12.
[58:51.83]Five hours with replayability.
[58:54.25]There you go.
[58:55.19]Okay, I'm try- I don't want to do this segment anymore.
[59:17.86]I've been riding on the horse for like, honestly, how long?
[59:21.42]How long have we done tutorial horse for?
[59:24.18]It's been like 14 or 15 straight minutes of just riding on the horse for tutorial.
[59:30.65]Holy shit.
[59:31.39]And he's going to take it from me anyways.
[59:40.94]The whole game is a tutorial.
[59:49.55]Alright, let's go.
[60:16.20]She ditched you.
[60:19.56]Alright, watch the stamina bar.
[60:26.59]Horse riding sim?
[60:27.29]This is not even a horse riding sim though.
[60:28.83]This is watching a horse riding sim movie.
[60:31.07]Alright, let's go.
[60:31.77]Cross the bridge.
[60:44.20]Alright, how do I pull back?
[60:45.08]Pull back the reins.
[60:45.62]Oh, shit.
[60:47.00]Okay.
[60:47.17]I just choked on my own saliva.
[60:48.11]Okay.
[61:16.11]I can't go off the edge.
[61:16.79]I tried.
[61:18.69]Come one, come all.
[61:22.43]Oh my god, a TV show.
[61:26.85]Glowing circles show optional side areas to explore.
[61:30.55]Optional side areas.
[61:31.95]Alright, we gotta see what this Red Dead Redemption 2 stranger is.
[61:46.12]Let's see.
[61:48.88]What are we doing here?
[61:49.56]Oh, I like choked on my spit and it like gave me a headache.
[61:54.41]Alright, stop.
[61:57.11]Who are you?
[61:57.57]Welcome to my theater of fate, sir.
[62:02.09]I swear to God, if he comes up with two brushes, I'm going to be so pissed.
[62:06.67]Although everyone else calls me Jeffrey.
[62:09.85]What do you see?
[62:12.19]Wait, do not speak.
[62:14.58]For Bernie the Magnificent knows all things.
[62:23.25]Ah, yes.
[62:24.92]I see it now.
[62:26.92]This is the whole game?
[62:27.86]I don't think so, chicken chicer.
[62:32.36]Oh, look, he's a little chicken chicer.
[62:36.15]Chicken chicer.
[62:36.87]No, no, stay, stay, stay, stay!
[62:54.86]Oh, shit!
[62:55.44]God fucking damn it.
[63:25.25]What the fuck?
[63:26.61]I wanted to do that.
[63:27.73]If we didn't have the stretched out timeline.
[63:42.09]Oh, and yes, that's me, the magician.
[63:44.86]Excuse me, I will be painting your walls and your ceilings if you want to.
[63:49.50]Just fucking tell me what you want me to do.
[63:51.72]I'm here.
[63:57.31]We can be pretty fast when we have to be, eh, girl?
[64:04.07]Daniel, keep the line tight as we cross the bridge.
[64:07.28]We've had reports of hop raiding parties roaming the edgelands.
[64:10.92]What's the world coming to?
[64:13.40]Mad cuz bad.
[64:14.70]Daniel, so glad you could join us.
[64:16.84]I'm needed at the front of the convoy.
[64:18.58]Oh, thank god you could join us for the slow part of the tutorial.
[64:21.54]Can I go with you?
[64:22.44]Oh, you can't even speed up?
[64:25.10]Keep an eye out for danger.
[64:27.23]What shall I do with the other eye?
[64:29.03]Very funny.
[64:30.39]Just do your job and keep up with the convoy.
[64:33.43]I'm counting on you.
[64:35.11]And make sure you don't fall asleep again, alright?
[64:38.23]I'm not pulling you out of any more ditches.
[64:40.94]Yeah!
[64:41.68]Yeah!
[64:49.46]Did you hear that, Sarah?
[64:50.98]Did you hear what he said to me?
[64:52.42]Did you hear that?
[64:53.21]Did you hear that?
[64:54.45]After all the trouble I got into last time...
[65:10.03]What even happened?
[65:14.86]How long has it been?
[65:16.58]He fucking fell asleep?
[65:18.02]What?
[65:18.90]He actually fell asleep?
[65:24.59]Why did he fall asleep?
[65:35.08]Red orbs.
[65:36.80]What are you doing?
[65:43.41]Go!
[65:47.01]Catch up with everybody.
[65:47.91]He fell asleep holding the reins.
[65:50.31]I saw the death symbol and I was like, I gotta get some action in here.
[66:13.20]It's crossing the bridge!
[66:14.26]Hurry!
[66:14.82]Dammit, Gabriel, where are you?
[66:18.09]Goddammit, I'm trying to go off the edge!
[66:19.67]I'm trying to get some fucking comedy on my stream!
[66:22.03]All I have to do is stay awake.
[66:23.96]Why didn't I stay awake?
[66:31.46]Wait, I gotta inject an absolute comedy home run right now.
[66:35.42]Why would Malwarebytes be talking about?
[66:37.60]What?
[66:38.73]Why is Malwarebytes popping up?
[66:40.07]Oh shit!
[66:40.87]What happened down there?
[66:42.45]I thought that was us for a second.
[67:11.57]Just go fly him.
[67:14.88]What was that?
[67:17.34]Why'd he run out and... What was that one's hand?
[67:20.30]I can't hear you!
[67:21.62]I didn't pick up anything you said!
[67:39.60]Sorry, but I'm going to assume you said to go to, uh, Miremore.
[67:44.28]That's where I'm going.
[68:04.65]Miremore?
[68:05.51]What did he say?
[68:06.38]Miremore.
[68:11.42]What did he say?
[68:16.42]Like, the mire?
[68:19.98]Manor Moor?
[68:23.48]I hope he falls asleep again.
[68:25.92]Oh, Microsoft Studios presents... A Lionhead Studios production!
[68:35.32]What a seamless, seamless transition to the game.
[68:40.39]Fable!
[68:41.51]The Journey!
[68:48.41]Starring... You!
[68:51.78]This is a fucking pog moment, I'm ready.
[69:01.30]Wake up asleep again, please.
[69:02.94]And then maybe you have to go like this for an hour.
[69:10.54]Who's on that map?
[69:10.98]Oh, the GPS really took you a fucking shitty way.
[69:12.60]You could've gone, like, straight.
[69:14.18]There's like five roads that go that way.
[69:16.42]Okay, here we go.
[69:38.17]I can't believe that just happened.
[69:39.73]I can't believe we're stuck out here, alone, miles away from anywhere.
[69:43.26]If I'd just stayed awake, we'd be across that bridge and on our way home by now, not stuck out here.
[69:50.40]The map says there's a village up ahead.
[69:52.44]There's a village.
[69:53.26]Someone there will be able to help us.
[69:55.83]Reach the village.
[69:58.23]I'm trying!
[69:59.35]Go slower!
[70:22.32]Alright, we made it to Fairwood.
[70:24.08]You need to be careful!
[70:26.00]You've just earned your first upgrade token.
[70:28.86]You can access your upgrades from the pause menu.
[70:31.69]To pause the game now, hold your left arm straight out to the side.
[70:34.83]Are you fucking kidding me?
[70:38.21]Upgrade menu?
[70:43.21]What the fuck are you kidding me?
[70:44.21]This is fucking awesome.
[70:46.37]...being dangerous.
[70:47.47]As long as we keep ourselves to ourselves, maybe we'll be alright.
[70:52.86]Calm down.
[70:53.58]Whoa.
[70:55.20]Upgrades.
[71:05.13]Force upgrade.
[71:13.33]Okay.
[71:17.69]Redeem Fable Heroes gold?
[71:25.09]Oh yeah, didn't they do a thing where they made... At least the weather's holding up for us!
[71:29.67]They did a thing, they did do a thing, right?
[71:31.89]Where there was this slot machine game that they came out with?
[71:38.02]Was it like a card game?
[71:39.08]You made money and you could use it in Fable 2 or something?
[71:41.00]I'm gonna hit that!
[71:49.24]Don't worry sir, and every step we take is one step closer to home!
[71:58.46]Alright, pull it back.
[72:00.66]When will it push the cart to one side?
[72:02.24]God damn, like the Kinect is like the 3D glasses of the last generation.
[72:12.61]It really was.
[72:14.19]It was the stereographic 3D glasses of the last generation before this one.
[72:18.51]Hey!
[72:29.23]I got struck by a fucking lightning?
[72:32.81]Easy, girl.
[72:33.61]Easy, easy, easy.
[72:36.57]Easy, girl.
[72:37.67]Easy, girl.
[72:38.35]Come on.
[72:40.94]Next game.
[72:41.64]Not... Hold on a second here.
[72:42.70]Wait till I get a weapon.
[72:43.58]What is that?
[72:44.72]Let me get a weapon first.
[72:50.36]Oh, shit.
[72:54.72]Something's coming.
[73:00.60]Sword.
[73:00.86]Why does he not have a weapon?
[73:20.07]We have choices to make, like in Fable?
[73:23.23]Like, let the lady get eaten by the monster, or like, fix the ship.
[73:36.34]Who's come who
[74:03.18]Don't worry, I got this.
[74:04.74]You know around here?
[74:06.80]Yeah, me too.
[74:07.66]I just rolled in.
[74:09.44]You're not waving your arms enough.
[74:14.84]You're not waving your arms enough.
[74:15.90]More arm waving.
[74:33.04]The only way we'll be able to escape.
[74:38.57]It's flooding everything.
[74:40.33]How are we going to get away from this thing?
[74:52.30]It's shooting at us.
[74:59.55]He's shooting us!
[75:02.87]Watch out, spikes!
[75:07.81]This is a Disney ride.
[75:12.27]This is a Disney ride that you get off and you go, that was not very good.
[75:17.89]It's one of those boxes you go in and you go like this for four straight minutes.
[75:21.74]Oh, there he comes!
[75:24.84]Look out!
[75:27.91]There's a screen.
[75:35.99]And then you get off the ride and you kind of look around and you're like, ah.
[75:40.78]That was like, it took us like 40 minutes to get on that.
[75:45.40]Like, just, can I just eat like the Mickey Mouse bar?
[75:48.30]Here it comes, we arrive.
[75:55.04]Okay, if like a YouTube video of the ride is as good as the ride, I don't know if it's worth waiting an hour for.
[76:16.96]On rails?
[76:17.48]This is not even on rails.
[76:18.94]I'm not even really doing anything.
[76:24.01]It is on, but like, completely on rails.
[76:29.84]That's what on rails means.
[76:30.98]Oh my god!
[76:33.44]Whoa, and right there you look over and your mom is like, it's like, oh, mom's having a good fucking time.
[76:42.40]I'm having fun, because mom's having fun.
[76:49.24]Oh!
[76:50.08]Flash!
[76:51.36]Oh, they just took the picture!
[76:57.69]Every time I tell me from crazy Every single time I look at one of those photos of me.
[77:02.59]I tell me if you guys do this too I try so hard to not look weird I know exactly when the fucking flash is gonna happen, but I desperately don't want to look weird So I sit there on like I'm like don't want to look a little like I'm having too much fun Cuz I'd be like weird, but every time I go in and look I always look like my face admitted a clay Every time
[77:23.18]It doesn't matter if I'm like smiling or if I'm like going like this or something.
[77:27.59]My face always looks like this.
[77:29.15]I just look like shit every time.
[77:36.99]I've tried to look good in those photos.
[77:40.47]Like I know it's coming.
[77:41.39]They're going over the bend.
[77:42.57]I know this is where they take the flash.
[77:46.21]I go like that.
[77:46.61]Like I don't want to look weird.
[77:48.41]But it doesn't matter.
[77:48.97]Even if I sit there and I go like this.
[77:49.94]I know the flash is coming.
[77:52.36]Oh, let's go find it!
[77:53.30]Okay, Flash, let's go find it at the end.
[77:54.91]Okay, where is it?
[77:58.25]What the fuck, dude?
[77:59.19]I tried to not look like a fucking weirdo.
[78:14.80]Find a safe place to stop.
[78:18.94]I'm giving this one some more time.
[78:20.35]Whoa, girl.
[78:22.13]I have to get those splinters out of you.
[78:24.15]Oh, God.
[78:24.81]Okay, here we go.
[78:29.17]Whatever that was, it's gone now.
[78:33.37]I know.
[78:34.41]I know I'm scared.
[78:34.91]The horse is now evil?
[78:40.52]If this is a loading screen to pull the arrow out... Saren has been seriously injured.
[78:46.89]Grab the splinter with your right hand and slowly pull it out.
[78:50.71]Be careful while pulling the splinter or you may hurt Saren.
[78:56.22]Then, when you're done, grab the brush and give her a nice scrub.
[79:04.48]Saren has been...
[79:25.26]Trying to go slow.
[79:26.52]I'm sorry.
[79:27.10]I got it.
[79:35.17]Let me pet.
[79:35.99]I'm too close but so far away.
[79:37.55]Let me pet the horse.
[79:42.89]Oh, yes.
[79:43.25]That was a... Let me... Yes.
[79:45.57]That was a loading screen to pull out a splinter to go to a loading screen for a cutscene.
[79:51.15]You're a seer.
[79:54.20]I'm just, I'm just like, hate playing this game now.
[80:06.41]I need to know what's in it.
[80:07.83]I have to know.
[80:11.64]Connect doesn't sound like such a good idea anymore, does it?
[80:14.78]Poison?
[80:27.28]Alright, after this stream is over, I'm going to dropkick the Kinect and see how far I can punt it on the football field.
[80:33.16]I think I could get it 30 yards.
[80:34.16]I think I could.
[80:34.64]At least 20.
[80:34.86]At least 15?
[80:35.32]I think I could get it at least 10 to 15.
[80:38.35]If you give me a big enough shoe, I think I could do it.
[81:04.50]I'm having fun though.
[81:06.12]We're almost there.
[81:07.39]Follow this road.
[81:10.39]Oh no.
[81:11.07]I can't lose her.
[81:13.95]Then you must keep her moving.
[81:15.29]The poison is spreading.
[81:16.49]What happens if it finds us again?
[81:22.31]A choice will have to be made.
[81:24.31]What is on the back of this box?
[81:26.37]Fight?
[81:27.41]What chance would we have against that thing?
[81:29.27]After what happened back there?
[81:30.79]Not yet.
[81:36.09]Beware the magic.
[81:36.77]The fate of Albion is in your hands.
[81:38.79]Your easygoing nomadic life is forever altered when you suddenly become successor to vast and mysterious powers.
[81:48.18]Set off to uncover the evil that threatens the land as you learn to control your growing magic and bring to bear the power that will decide the future of Albion.

[82:08.91]That's not real.
[82:10.79]We've rid a horse for an hour.
[82:16.85]We are still alive.
[82:21.48]What it should read, what it should say is... Use your magical hands to brush the horse back and forth four times.
[82:31.09]Lean into the stunning beauty of removing a splinter.
[82:41.79]I bet you we cast one spell in the next 45 minutes, and I want to be certain of it.
[82:46.70]He hates it.
[82:58.50]Is she going to make it?
[82:59.90]You can see the future.
[83:01.28]Seers know everything, right?
[83:02.96]Seers know everything.
[83:04.24]The injury that devourer dealt me appears to have clouded my vision.
[83:08.15]We have a chance.
[83:10.13]That's such a funny, like, mysterious fantasy cop-out.
[83:16.65]Oh, I'm a seer.
[83:17.65]Oh, yes.
[83:19.25]If we don't get there in exactly 14 minutes, yes, the poison will get her.
[83:24.82]Like, a seer can see.
[83:26.02]Oh, yes, there's great evil coming in the next hour of gameplay.
[83:29.70]Evil on the way.
[83:30.50]I'm a seer.
[83:31.04]I can see it.
[83:31.56]Like, I want a seer to be wrong.
[83:35.86]I want a seer to be like, oh, the great and powerful evil is upon us.
[83:39.19]It will be here in two days.
[83:41.73]Oh, it's got big horns.
[83:43.35]And it's like a squirrel.
[83:46.36]And it's like, holy shit, that was a fucking squirrel.
[83:48.06]You were completely wrong.
[83:49.92]And they disappear.
[83:50.70]They're gone the next day.
[83:52.80]That character is gone.
[83:53.80]Because they know they fucked it all up and they left.
[83:56.07]And you prepare like a week for this monster.
[83:58.05]Hamely guy did that.
[84:06.07]I thought my fly was down.
[84:16.78]You ever see somebody seated, getting up that fast and walking at you?
[84:20.60]Oh, get out of the way.
[84:21.28]You gotta get out of the fucking way.
[84:22.58]You know what I mean?
[84:23.60]Like... It's like, I'm getting out of the way.
[84:26.94]Get out of the way quick.
[84:29.02]This guy got up really fast.
[84:31.08]You hear that, Saren?
[84:31.90]We'll have you better before you know it.
[84:41.25]Irma, your fly was open.
[84:44.47]I must warn you, Gabriel.
[84:46.05]The power to save your horse will come at a price.
[84:48.63]Then I'll pay it.
[84:49.67]Anything to save Saren.
[84:50.95]Very well.
[84:54.21]This horse is dead.
[84:55.15]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[84:56.41]The horse is going to die in 10 seconds.
[84:59.99]We are here.
[85:01.61]The pool of sight.
[85:03.59]He's dead.
[85:20.73]Leave the animal here.
[85:22.87]Don't be afraid.
[85:24.07]No evil can approach the pool.
[85:26.73]My connect seat, it's not calibrated.
[85:29.00]It doesn't think I'm sitting here.
[85:30.86]I'm here.
[85:31.34]I'm here.
[85:32.66]I'm here.
[85:33.66]I'm right here.
[85:34.28]God damn it.
[85:34.76]This thing, I have to recalibrate it.
[85:35.88]I'm right here.
[85:36.46]Oh my god damn it.
[85:38.24]Here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
[85:39.60]I shouldn't have done that.
[85:42.14]I'm going to puke.
[85:48.15]Three heroes guard the pool and the artifact that lies beneath its surface.
[85:53.41]Blaze, the hero of fire.
[85:56.93]Stone, the hero of the fallen.
[86:00.39]And Sol, the hero of light.
[86:04.03]Great champions who long ago sacrificed their lives for the Albion champions.
[86:13.16]Approach.
[86:13.62]Approach.
[86:14.24]I thought that was me doing it.
[86:16.16]No, that is me.
[86:18.39]Gaze into the water.
[86:26.63]The means to heal your horse lies within the water.
[86:28.79]I have to dunk my head?
[86:36.40]Reach into the water.
[86:44.00]Oh my god!
[86:44.70]It's been so long since I've had water!
[86:49.09]I don't understand.
[86:51.41]What is this?
[86:53.12]I don't carry much.
[86:54.00]I like to play in water.
[87:05.60]No.
[87:09.76]No.
[87:12.04]No, not my horse.
[87:12.98]I like that horse.
[87:14.49]No.
[87:23.49]Why do you sit like that?
[87:24.37]Wait, what?
[87:25.69]Where is he?
[87:27.91]What?
[87:28.49]It wants you to sit like this?
[87:29.81]What are they talking about?
[87:32.38]Your real trial is only just beginning.
[87:51.26]Bolt is your primary damage spell.
[87:53.85]To cast it, bring your right hand up to your shoulder, then thrust it towards your target.
[87:59.81]I look so, like, just lazy.
[88:05.45]At least it's doing the thing I said.
[88:18.23]Okay.
[88:18.33]Good shot.
[89:01.10]Let me just fucking do the thing I want to do.
[89:02.51]You know what's, like, weird about this?
[89:11.71]Okay, casting.
[89:14.32]You cast spells, you can go, like, put your hand up and then go like this.
[89:17.20]Don't you feel like you'd be giving somebody directions at some point in the fucking game?
[89:21.14]It's like, oh yeah, uh, yeah, the grocery store, you want to trot over down to, uh, to, to, uh, Fairbottom, and then...
[89:37.34]Just interrupted my fucking joke.
[89:49.96]Whatever.
[89:50.32]I... Okay.
[89:51.64]LOL, TL;DR.
[89:52.98]I killed a person that I was, like, over there.
[89:54.76]Because I was giving directions and pointing around. ...
[90:31.24]I'm clearly hitting this guy.
[90:32.64]I just hit him.
[90:44.18]How am I not hitting him?
[90:49.12]No!
[90:56.42]No!
[91:18.32]This hurts my fucking arm!
[91:19.72]Are you acting too?
[91:56.64]Next game?
[91:57.18]Not- Hold on.
[92:08.26]Don't tell me I'm doing it wrong.
[92:23.70]I was doing it wrong.
[92:24.39]It can't be.
[93:00.25]What the fuck?
[93:01.31]It's not even... I can't hit that guy.
[93:21.12]I can't hit that guy.
[93:22.08]I can't hit him.
[93:57.20]I'm too close?
[93:58.06]I am not too close.
[94:03.10]How was I too close?
[94:11.87]No, I'm not.
[94:14.01]I'm not too close.
[94:32.03]Get me the fuck out of here.
[94:38.64]That actually... What did he say?
[94:41.78]That actually right.
[94:44.28]I can't take it anymore.
[94:45.22]Connect ResidentSleeper.
[94:48.67]The bot is so good.
[94:51.77]The nominee for 2021 Meltdown?
[94:52.87]No, no, no.
[94:53.93]No, I'm good.
[94:54.81]I'm good.
[94:55.27]Go ahead.
[94:55.81]Oh, stunning!
[94:56.55]You can do stun!
[95:25.75]I'm not gonna sword?
[95:50.25]I wanna know how many people on Christmas morning sat here doing this.
[95:55.37]You have a lot of brain power to like do this.
[95:59.97]We could probably, I wanna know the collective brain power it took on Christmas morning, everybody doing this.
[96:06.88]Yeah, did you figure it out yet?
[96:08.56]I can't say, I'm trying to get the calibration to work, son.
[96:12.56]This thing is wild.
[96:14.48]It actually knows where my hand is.
[96:24.09]Oh, I got it!
[96:24.73]You wanna try, son?
[96:26.22]No.
[96:26.34]Are you sure?
[96:26.94]No, not really.
[96:28.00]It's a lot of fun!
[96:30.12]Internal monologue going here.
[96:32.36]This was like a $200 fucking dollar add-on.
[96:42.56]You don't want to try it?
[96:44.75]I'll be in my room playing my PlayStation.
[96:48.73]Oh.
[96:48.89]I'll call you in when I think I get to a cool party.

[97:58.42]I can move this thing around if I move my arm around!
[98:04.90]Oh, this sure is fun!
[98:05.59]What's that?
[98:05.85]What's that, honey?
[98:06.37]We got Snickers ice cream bars, too, in the freezer?
[98:22.89]Hey, Dad.
[98:24.05]Oh, hey, son.
[98:24.65]Come sit down.

[98:52.24]I could make it fly with my hand.
[99:00.21]You want to try?
[99:02.07]No.

[99:05.41]Um... Yes.

[99:16.39]But I have
[99:17.71]How many are in a box?
[99:19.31]There are only four in a box.
[99:20.83]It's bullshit.
[99:24.77]Alright.
[99:25.59]You can have one more, son.
[99:26.92]Why don't you take a look at what your dear old dad can do here.
[99:29.44]Okay, I think I'm done.
[99:43.07]I'm done watching.
[99:43.85]What?
[99:46.84]no more ice cream to keep up here connect rack
[100:20.24]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[100:43.17]Actually, I am a little sore.
[100:53.94]I'll get it.
[100:54.48]I'll get it.
[100:55.04]I'll get it.
[100:56.66]Don't worry, son.
[100:57.66]Don't worry.
[100:59.28]I'll get it.
[101:05.89]Skeleton.
[101:07.03]What's that?
[101:07.55]Why is there a skeleton on the couch?
[101:11.81]Hey!
[101:17.79]How long has it been?
[101:18.47]What am I sitting here for?
[101:23.86]How long has it been?
[101:28.24]Is there a skeleton over there?
[101:41.19]I'm done.
[102:04.98]Is it time to play Let's Cheer?
[102:15.30]Is it time to play Let's Cheer?
[102:16.74]I'll be right back.
[102:23.19]I'm going to get some water.
[102:28.65]That was absolutely fucking dreadful.
[102:30.85]I'll be right back.
[105:48.04]You know, I talked a lot of shit about that game.
[105:53.44]The more that I thought about it when I had a glass of water, you know, the more that I think the Kinect has a peripheral.
[106:01.36]It's probably so limited that it'd be like trying to code Skyrim on an Atari.
[106:10.12]You kind of just can't.
[106:18.10]Like, what can we have people do?
[106:19.38]Okay, they can wave their hands in the air.
[106:23.30]And it can recognize their face.
[106:28.09]And it has a microphone.
[106:32.39]So if you make noises, it can tell.
[106:34.37]Is there copyright music in this?
[106:40.41]I feel like I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[106:43.01]We're about to find out.
[106:45.87]I need to tune this.
[106:46.49]Move this out of the way.
[106:49.67]There's probably a shitload of copyrighted music in here.
[106:59.67]Is this the correct gamer?
[107:00.57]Alright, here we go.
[107:10.67]Okay.
[107:13.71]It's called Cheers.
[107:14.89]Is it the correct gamer?
[107:17.56]It is.
[107:21.41]This is called, let's cheer.
[107:29.71]Ready to save.
[107:32.91]Alright, this is gonna be probably very embarrassing.
[107:34.83]Alright, select squad captain.
[107:35.60]Okay.
[107:35.70]Alright, Megan, Brianna, or Hailey.
[107:51.10]I think.
[107:55.85]I just broke the Kinect.
[108:02.34]What have I seen?
[108:02.76]Seen a lot of Megan.
[108:04.46]I've seen a lot of Megan.
[108:05.30]Alright, Megan's captain.
[108:14.62]Go ahead and pick any of the colors on the right.
[108:16.98]Both your colors and squad captain can be changed at any time, so feel free to mix it up later on.
[108:21.29]Go.
[108:28.12]Selecting Cheers will get us started.
[108:29.84]Cheers?
[108:30.30]Extras is where you can see all your current stats, awards, and have some options to compete.
[108:36.40]Okay, local, district, state, regionals, nationals?
[108:41.18]Local levels will have the easiest chance in dance routines, where the national level will contain the hardest.
[108:45.76]Are we going back to nationals?
[108:47.88]We have to go local.
[108:49.96]You can pick any level you would like.
[108:51.34]Local.
[108:51.48]We'll go local first.
[108:53.50]There are several chants and two dance routines to pick from on your right.
[108:57.40]Some items are locked and will be unlocked as you do well in the corresponding sections.
[109:01.60]Now choose one that sounds good to you and we can get started.
[109:04.30]This is a great football chant to start with.
[109:16.98]It has simple movements that should be easy for you to do.
[109:21.24]Crane.
[109:21.80]Let's just find out how to do it first.
[109:24.67]It's so loud.
[109:27.41]Here comes DMCA.
[109:28.41]Is it?
[109:33.99]We're gonna get DMCA?
[109:34.61]It's slow.
[109:35.47]Defense.
[109:44.76]Defense.
[109:46.12]Attack.
[109:46.38]Do I have to sing it too?
[109:48.36]Push that offense back.
[109:50.00]This needs to be faster.
[109:50.86]It needs to be defense.
[109:52.42]Attack.
[109:53.10]Attack.
[109:53.54]Push that offense back.
[109:54.76]Why is it so slow?
[109:55.56]Push that offense back.
[109:57.04]Attack.
[110:02.96]Let's crank up the speed a bit and turn on the score feedback.
[110:05.52]Okay.
[110:06.36]Six, seven, eight.
[110:08.34]Defense.
[110:17.38]This is like, this is like daycare.
[110:19.96]I have to sing it, right?
[110:21.74]I can't do that shit.
[110:22.88]I'll try, I will try to get that.
[110:25.47]I'm gonna wreck my pants.
[110:46.47]I'm going to do that and you're going to hear... Alright, let's get fired up.
[110:48.68]I'm ready.
[110:49.00]Let's go.
[110:49.32]I'm just a fan in the audience doing their moves.
[111:21.11]Why is he on a giant birthday cake?
[111:26.22]Oh my god, that hurt.
[111:48.87]That's, this game's, they're not that long.
[111:51.90]This is so short.
[111:52.82]Okay, how about Celebration?
[111:55.80]You're gonna take another month break?
[111:59.20]Nah, I'll be fine.
[112:00.40]Get the crowd to join your celebration by mastering this cheer routine to perfection.
[112:04.24]Okay, um, let's train.
[112:06.32]I'm gonna train and I'm gonna perform it.
[112:10.95]DMCA, DMCA, DMCA, what?
[112:19.95]Wait, is this a real song?
[112:26.00]This training is at a slower tempo and without the music to help you learn the routine.
[112:29.61]Why is everything moving?
[112:34.64]Six, seven, eight.
[112:50.06]Oh shit!
[112:51.05]She's casting Fireball!
[113:18.03]It's embarrassing.
[113:19.31]This is embarrassing to me.
[113:24.16]Oh, clock arms.
[113:59.63]I think you're good to go.
[114:00.69]Delete this stream.
[114:03.94]Why don't you delete that comment?
[114:15.80]I'm about to rip this one out too, excuse.
[114:21.59]I'm gonna go for a competition.
[114:25.81]We're going right to regionals.
[114:30.89]Welcome to the regionals.
[114:32.25]Here, only the groups that have won at a state level normally compete.
[114:37.45]Can someone say kick?
[114:38.91]I hope so because this Chan has got one.
[114:41.01]Stick with it to get it down and wow the crowd.
[114:44.38]I can't do Mickey.
[114:45.04]I'm going to get arrested.
[114:45.98]If I do Mickey, I'm going to get arrested because I got steamed here.
[115:06.29]I'm just the guy in the front row on drugs.
[115:09.28]At like a concert.
[115:13.54]Thank you for coming to our show and good night.
[115:18.74]That's not that long.
[115:19.87]It needs to be much longer than that.
[115:21.49]It's like, oh, that guy is... Oh, wait a minute.
[115:42.11]Somebody like snatched me.
[115:44.54]Somebody snatched me.
[115:45.70]I was in the middle and like before they took the photo, somebody like fucking snatched me and pulled me.
[115:51.44]Look at that mouth.
[115:58.61]I can't even look at it.
[116:09.06]Yeah, keep that covered.
[116:11.26]For sure.
[116:15.58]What?
[116:25.10]I'm going to get arrested.
[116:27.26]How about be aggressive?
[116:31.67]Oh.
[116:32.11]A crowd favorite for any type of sporting event.
[116:34.57]Learn this regional difficulty chant and the crowds will alert.
[116:37.03]It's not like a disconnected jaw.
[116:38.95]It's like a cryptid?
[116:40.49]What the fuck is a cryptid?
[116:41.65]Alright, I'm ready.
[116:48.79]Aggressive.
[116:53.83]B-E-A-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E.
[116:59.19]Aggressive.
[117:00.53]B-E-A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V.
[117:03.90]I'm so, I'm the fucking annoying person at the concert.
[117:06.66]I can't get over it.
[117:08.62]B-E-A-G-G-R-E-E-S-S-I-V.
[117:13.94]Go get them.
[117:18.17]Come on.
[117:19.45]I'm ready.
[117:28.86]There was no photo?
[117:29.48]Why was there no photo?
[117:42.87]Take the sus face.
[117:44.27]No.
[117:48.52]Do Mickey.
[117:49.53]Oh my god, I want to do Disturbia so bad.
[117:51.79]I want to do Disturbia so fucking bad, but I'm gonna get in trouble if I do.
[117:56.11]Is it cover?
[117:56.65]It don't matter.
[118:25.83]Mute the song?
[118:26.83]Just sing over it.
[118:31.48]Okay, fine.
[118:31.92]Here we go.
[118:43.77]Wait, wait.
[118:45.65]Hold on.
[118:45.93]Alright, I'll do it.
[118:48.71]Yeah, I'm ready.
[118:49.48]Okay.
[118:52.84]I was like, I got it.
[119:12.78]This is the lyrics.
[119:23.87]It's not a creeper.
[119:26.53]I got swinging steps and I'm swinging back.
[119:31.13]I got cross steps and we're gonna shoulder shake.
[119:35.10]Don't get too close to me.
[119:36.78]Drop it down, pop it up.
[119:38.99]Pop it up, play nice, and you swim back.
[119:43.61]And you bring it on up, then you think twice.
[119:47.35]Then you got altered thoughts and no flutter.
[119:50.77]Don't you dare, what's on your mind?
[119:53.11]It's Disturbia.
[119:55.69]Creepers on air are in Disturbia.
[119:59.42]We gotta swing back with the cross steps.
[120:03.16]We got those shoulder shakes, steps too close.
[120:06.12]This is how they do it when they choreograph, by the way.
[120:09.03]The person, I don't even care.
[120:10.35]I don't even give a shit.
[120:11.75]I don't care.
[120:12.11]You have to hear that.
[120:14.87]When you, when choreographers are doing a dance routine, they'll, to the beat, they go like, and that's when we get those two arms up and you swing with the back, shake, stamp, stamp.
[120:49.57]Got a feelin'!
[120:51.03]What about District?
[120:55.99]You're losing your mind?
[120:57.01]I like to move it, move it!
[120:57.75]I like to move it, do Mickey!
[120:58.55]Why are we not allowed to have fun anymore?
[121:24.43]I would love to do, I like to move it, move it.
[121:28.54]But somewhere, there is somebody with a giant fucking cigar that they haven't ashed yet.
[121:33.70]And it's just like three quarters of ash.
[121:36.34]And they're just like... Then they take the cigars, then they... They ash it into their own fucking mouth.
[121:48.70]Why can't we have any fun?! !
[121:53.65]WHY CAN'T WE HAVE ANY FUN?!
[122:04.13]This chant has a few harder moves in it, but well worth the results it will bring you when your fans are on their feet.
[122:09.83]Like, what, because you're gonna hear... I like to move it, move it on a live stream in fucking Let's Cheer the video game?
[122:18.01]But that- Ah, no no no no no!
[122:19.31]They're not gonna go out and they're not gonna buy that CD from fucking 2008!
[122:26.74]And out of here!
[122:27.36]When was the last time any of you fucking guys bought a CD?
[122:32.10]How many of you guys just use Spotify?
[122:35.86]And, like, iTunes and shit?
[122:37.10]Does it really matter if, like, I hear a song from, like, 15, 20 years ago?
[122:44.71]On a broadcast?
[122:49.21]Honestly, I wouldn't even be surprised if somebody DMC'd this.
[122:54.57]Like, this is a song that, you know, I have the cheer music rights.
[122:59.39]Yeah, I did the dribble, dribble, hoop, hoop song.
[123:15.90]Sounds like a Wiggles song.
[123:23.27]I want to get another picture.
[123:25.49]I'm going back to Nationals.
[123:26.45]We're doing one more.
[123:27.19]One more and I'm going to move on.
[123:38.82]Ooh, Star Andy.
[123:42.78]Go to Regionals.
[123:44.60]I want... Okay, block out.
[123:46.04]I'm going to try to get five stars because I want to get a photo.
[123:51.11]We got...
[124:26.76]Oh, start!
[124:28.86]Why can't I get... Why did I only get one photo?
[124:57.14]Young and old alive will be dancing in the stands as you perform this instant classic.
[125:02.34]Play the words.
[125:02.88]We hope you enjoy this evening's show.
[125:07.68]Okay, I'm ready.
[125:08.34]Ready?
[125:09.88]Okay, girls, are you ready?
[125:12.41]Here we go.
[125:12.89]It's time for us just to do Mickey at our competition.
[125:17.89]No, no, no.
[125:22.17]I'll just sing it, girls.
[125:22.87]Don't worry.
[125:26.73]Hey.
[125:32.94]Without music, this looks fucking really weird.
[125:35.12]I look like a fucking creep.
[125:46.53]I can't do this.
[125:55.53]Who cares? Fuck it!
[125:57.53]I don't give a shit!
[126:05.77]I do. I do.
[126:06.31]I really do.
[126:06.79]I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. Oh I do.
[126:25.70]Too late.
[126:26.60]Oh, no!
[126:29.82]Oh, sorry!
[126:34.41]I'll never do it again!
[126:44.43]I didn't get one!
[126:45.18]Alright, I'm done with the cheer game.
[127:06.39]It wasn't very Mickey of you.
[127:07.69]I sweat.
[127:10.57]Yeah, well I'm getting up and moving.
[127:23.71]What's next?
[127:24.87]Hmm.
[127:35.48]Oh, I know.
[127:37.68]Take a shower?
[127:38.42]Hold on, not yet.
[127:46.04]Star Wars Connect?
[127:46.84]I can't even play that one either.
[127:53.80]Do an armpit check?
[127:54.74]No, thank you.
[128:06.55]No, thank you.
[128:09.19]This one is called UFC Trainer.
[128:12.61]Oh, come on.
[128:13.57]Update in progress.
[128:29.60]I have a tantrum.
[128:31.36]You know, in the sea of comments, I saw somebody say, you're an adult.
[128:38.94]Yeah.
[128:41.78]A lot of text.
[128:46.07]I can't be an adult and use the Kinect?
[128:47.55]That's what they made this for.
[128:50.31]This was made for six-year-olds and, like, 40-plus-year-olds.
[128:55.95]I fit into the category of people that want to have this.
[128:59.41]What are you talking about?
[129:00.46]Everyone says, oh, grandma, grandma, connect is the grandma accessory.
[129:04.70]Don't I hit the threshold of being old enough to play this?
[129:16.23]Right.
[129:20.25]Yeah, oh, sad.
[129:22.81]Good company.
[129:23.73]They work.
[129:27.81]40-year-old streamer.
[129:28.81]Not yet.
[129:31.25]I got some years in me here.
[129:33.03]Alright, UFC trainer.
[129:40.13]This is like a... Alright, this is like part of my body.
[129:46.15]That's in a really weird spot, too.
[129:48.07]I don't like where that is.
[129:49.49]I don't like where that is.
[129:51.22]I don't like where that is.
[129:52.42]I don't like where this is.
[129:53.26]Okay, whatever.
[129:55.70]Alright.
[129:59.37]It's gonna mess stuff up.
[130:06.38]That's kinda cool.
[130:11.32]That was cool.
[130:12.80]Why is my head so hot?
[130:15.00]Why is it a thermal camera and I have like a hot brain?
[130:18.30]Is my head gonna explode?
[130:22.68]What was that?
[130:23.16]I have like a heat, my head is so hot.
[130:38.49]Oh, you know when you have to hold it for more than a few seconds, that's... Enter your age, height, and weight, please.
[130:55.61]Come on, hurry up.
[131:02.04]Alright, that's... Oh.
[131:06.77]Would you like to use weights during your workout?
[131:11.45]Did I lie and just say I'm doing it?
[131:19.87]Oh.
[131:24.25]The road to the octagon starts here.
[131:26.15]I'm not doing any of these.
[131:27.65]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[131:28.42]What do you mean test?
[131:31.20]Fitness test?
[131:36.27]Take your pulse over 15 seconds.
[131:38.67]What?
[131:38.93]I'm doing this in jeans.
[131:48.80]It takes a lot of hard work.
[131:52.90]Preparing properly will not only yield better results, it'll reduce your chance of injury.
[131:57.73]So what kind of preparation am I talking about?
[132:03.05]What happened to my fucking fitness DVD?
[132:04.89]I don't know.
[132:06.47]I need to know.
[132:07.13]So this is what I'm talking about.
[132:12.76]We're over here now.
[132:19.28]Oh, you burnt the CD!
[132:20.76]You burnt the CD!
[132:22.50]You burnt the DVD, but you took it out before it was done burning, so I only got the first, like, fucking 12 seconds.
[132:27.66]...in front of the Kinect, with your body facing sideways toward the sensor.
[132:31.31]Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[132:36.75]I have to lie, you're not gonna be able to even see me!
[132:51.05]How do I do this?
[132:53.78]I gotta move the mic, the mic's gotta move.
[132:59.38]Why am I so hot?
[133:01.50]Ah!
[133:04.55]Oh my god, what's going on?
[133:06.09]Ah!
[133:06.45]Okay.
[133:20.53]Now for the sit-up test.
[133:21.59]Sit-up test.
[133:24.89]What do I need to do?
[133:25.49]Flat on your back, knees bent, and arms crossed in front of your chest.
[133:29.68]Lift your upper body up so that your elbows almost touch your knees.
[133:33.14]You'll have 60 seconds to see how many you can do.
[133:35.26]Okay.
[133:37.14]What's the world record?
[133:38.44]Ready?
[133:39.58]Go.
[133:39.80]60 seconds.
[133:51.96]Yeah.
[133:56.96]Stop if you're tired.
[134:00.44]Awesome.
[134:06.70]I would get thrown out of the gym.
[134:12.29]30 seconds left.
[134:16.97]Looking good.
[134:27.06]I got it!
[134:27.46]I gotta get to 20!
[134:32.66]Whoo!
[134:39.60]Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[134:39.90]Okay.
[135:00.79]Now for the push-up test.
[135:03.97]I'm going to try to get 100.
[135:05.13]With hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
[135:07.99]I hope I can flap my wings.
[135:10.31]Head looking down and slightly ahead of you.
[135:13.53]Slowly lower your chest to the ground, keeping your body rigid.
[135:18.05]Can you guys even see me?
[135:19.11]Push back to plank.
[135:20.91]You've got one minute to try to do as many as you can.
[135:23.27]Alright, you ready?
[135:25.73]Ready?
[135:25.95]Go.
[135:26.01]60 seconds.
[135:34.25]Nice.
[135:39.24]Bring it.
[135:44.26]Stop if you're tired.
[135:49.20]Keep it going.
[135:51.34]Awesome.
[135:51.70]30 seconds left.
[136:01.45]I gotta hit the spot where it thinks I'm moving up and down.
[136:03.61]I can't do anymore.
[136:19.01]I can't do anymore.
[136:20.31]I can't do anymore.
[136:21.11]Okay. 22.
[136:32.26]Stand in front of the connect with your body facing toward the sensor.
[136:35.22]Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[136:39.48]Are these?
[136:42.61]OK, last test.
[136:44.23]We need your active heart rate.
[136:45.91]We're going to do some jumping jacks to get your heart rate up.
[136:49.05]Let your arms hang at your side with your feet shoulder width apart.
[136:53.49]Oh, no, it's up.
[136:54.19]Motion jump, bringing your arms up and spreading your legs.
[136:57.59]We're going to do this for one minute to get your heart pumping.
[137:00.37]Once we are done with the jumping jacks, I want you to check your pulse again.
[137:03.57]I'll tell you when.
[137:04.23]I don't know how to do that.
[137:05.25]Ready?
[137:06.35]Go.
[137:09.12]60 seconds.
[137:13.92]Awesome.
[137:18.70]Good.
[137:23.73]Stop if you're tired.
[137:28.69]Keep it going.
[137:33.74]Nothing to it.
[137:39.06]30 seconds left.
[137:42.30]Hey.
[137:43.66]Hey, can I?
[137:43.88]Oh, OK.
[137:44.04]Alright, alright, alright.
[137:48.78]Looking good.
[137:53.89]Stop if you're tired.
[137:54.77]You have 10 seconds left.
[138:06.17]Now I'm gonna count down from 15.
[138:10.68]I want you to count how many times you feel a beat.
[138:14.02]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[138:14.56]Alright, I'm ready.

[138:22.88]Please input the amount of beats you count.
[138:49.10]My heart would fucking fly away.
[138:50.54]Alright, what am I doing?
[138:52.26]Five.
[138:55.10]Hey, that didn't even win me.
[138:56.40]Hey, bro, uh, go to the hospital.
[139:16.14]Wait, that's only five?

[141:02.06]And some knees.
[141:02.56]To keep you on your toes, I'm going to give you something to dodge every now and then.
[141:05.44]Alright.

[143:24.86]What?
[143:26.96]I got an F. I, like, burned six calories?
[143:40.49]How is that even possible?
[143:42.57]What?

[144:40.87]Build power and endurance at your own pace in free striking mode.
[144:44.59]OK.
[144:44.85]Work on your own combos and at your own pace.
[144:47.87]The more strikes you get in, the better.
[144:50.99]Ready?
[144:51.25]Go.
[145:49.76]Pulverize the target.
[145:54.42]Come on.

[147:14.46]It's a total paper roll.
[147:21.35]He's got, oh no, he's got a fuel.
[147:23.25]This thing's weighing like a pound.
[147:28.29]Pulverize the target.
[147:35.28]Yeah, you're really beating that target up.

[148:31.65]Your hits are nice and quick.
[148:38.63]Hold lines to target.
[148:45.74]Keep that striking pace up.
[148:47.16]It's been how long do I have to do this for?
[148:48.66]Five full minutes?
[148:52.00]I've been doing it for an hour.
[148:56.64]I feel like I've been here for a full hour doing this.
[148:59.62]I can't get 30,000.
[149:00.64]Keep attacking.
[149:06.78]Keep that striking pace up.
[149:13.91]Strike faster.
[149:20.89]Yeah, you're really beating that target up.

[149:28.65]Keep attacking.
[149:31.59]Give it a kiss?
[149:34.93]Keep that striking pace up.
[149:36.35]It's like a ranged attack.
[149:42.06]Strike faster.
[149:42.84]Ow.
[149:49.06]Don't let me down.
[149:49.78]Keep attacking.
[149:54.66]It's a fucking waste of time.
[149:56.42]Alright, how many calories did that burn?
[149:59.10]WHAT?!
[150:03.12]16 calories?!
[150:05.44]That was five minutes of just fucking spinning around like a psycho!
[150:08.19]Five full minutes of just waving my arms around and jumping around at 16 calories?!
[150:15.25]What?!
[150:20.43]No way!
[150:27.25]I feel like I burn more calories playing a horror game.
[150:32.39]I swear to God, I bet you I burn 40 calories an hour playing like Resident Evil.
[150:39.98]I would just speed back.
[150:40.94]I'm getting fucking tired.
[150:44.66]I'm not doing that for five goddamn minutes.
[150:54.40]20 beats per minute.
[151:00.63]Lied about height, lied about beats per minute.
[151:02.63]No wonder it's fucked up.
[151:05.61]I didn't lie about height.
[151:06.49]Stand in front of the Kinect with your body facing toward the sensor.
[151:09.30]Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[151:14.00]Let's work on the speed bag to improve your timing and dexterity.
[151:16.94]I'm gonna be good at this.
[151:18.59]Start slowly, then gradually work your way up to the proper speed.
[151:23.55]Ready?
[151:26.01]Begin.
[151:34.62]Too fast.
[151:41.98]You're punching too slowly.
[151:48.55]Finish strong.
[151:49.43]Great.
[152:06.88]Come on, I wanna go!
[152:09.24]I wanna do it with my feet, but like, I can't put my feet on camera.
[152:16.67]I wanna do it- I wanna put my light out, put my feet up and do it, but I- all you motherfuckers will clip that.
[152:22.47]Five calories?
[152:38.76]Too late?
[152:40.02]When?
[152:45.43]Alright.
[152:45.75]I think it's time to move on.
[152:58.66]Alright, hold on.
[152:59.52]I want to do tire flip.
[153:00.94]Wait, there's more.
[153:01.94]What else is in this?
[153:06.95]Oh.
[153:13.70]Alright, tire flip.
[153:16.46]Tire flip and then I'm moving on to... How long can you go for?
[153:19.98]Hole in the wall.
[153:25.93]We're going to play hole in the wall after this one.
[153:28.43]One minute.
[153:39.96]Pog, pog, pog.
[153:40.94]I've seen a lot of pogs.
[153:45.85]Jerm is exhausted.
[153:46.95]Yeah, I probably shouldn't have picked the, like, fucking exercise game.
[153:50.73]All the exercise games that just try to make you, like, get tired.
[153:52.54]Stand in front of the Kinect with your body facing toward the sensor.
[153:55.32]Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[154:01.20]Let's work out that entire body by doing some tire flips.
[154:04.40]No, I don't want to do this.
[154:05.28]Squat down and hold.
[154:06.34]I don't understand this.
[154:07.14]Then, when the indicator tells you to, stand up and push forward with both hands.
[154:11.42]Dude, I'm just going to eat Cheerios and, like, reduce some of the calories and walk.
[154:15.75]I'm not doing this.
[154:16.97]Like, just eat fucking, like, Honey Nut Cheerios or something.
[154:20.13]And walk.
[154:21.83]And jog sometimes.
[154:22.89]I don't want to do this.
[154:30.59]That tire is not going to flip itself.
[154:42.31]Hold the wall time.
[154:43.01]2012 Jerma long dead.
[154:43.95]2012 Jerma didn't like flip monster truck tires.
[154:51.86]Broken?
[154:53.52]Oh no.

[158:12.99]I can make my fucking body any form.
[158:18.69]Now, it's time to face the...
[159:00.30]What is this guy doing?
[159:01.34]Congratulations.
[159:10.71]Ah!
[159:11.13]Well done.
[159:14.35]Wow.

[159:33.78]Alright, round one.
[159:36.74]Round two?
[159:37.32]Wait, there are pictures?
[159:39.85]Look at all this junk over here!
[159:57.97]Look at all this trash!
[159:59.91]That's supposed to be a dog bed!
[160:03.63]That's my VR headset.
[160:06.52]And this thing's over here.
[160:14.63]This is a spoiler.
[160:19.19]A spoiler.
[160:22.28]This fucking thing.
[160:35.42]Come on.
[160:50.87]How you doing, man?
[160:51.99]How are things?
[160:52.69]Well, you know, things are good.
[160:55.01]Cool, cool, cool.
[160:57.42]You've been sitting over on the dog bed.
[160:59.80]Yeah.
[161:00.66]Well, you know, the dog bed is comfy.
[161:04.27]I thought that you'd be, um, I was going to wait to put you on screen for a little while.
[161:08.60]You were?
[161:09.62]Yeah, I just figured it wasn't your time yet.
[161:12.74]Why would you do that?
[161:13.48]I'm ready to be on camera.
[161:15.56]Okay.
[161:17.45]What's your name anyways?
[161:19.25]Orange.
[161:20.31]Oh, easy, really easy to remember and easy to come up with on the spot without having any time.
[161:23.93]Cool.
[161:24.45]Hi, Orange.
[161:25.05]So would you like to go back into dog bed?
[161:27.63]Of course I would.
[161:28.70]It's very comfy.
[161:39.49]I'll do a little bit of cleaning, okay?
[161:46.07]Why do I use my mouse?
[161:47.61]What else we got?
[161:48.17]I'm here.
[161:50.13]I think I'm here.
[161:56.85]How do I get this off the screen?
[162:18.60]What else we got?
[162:28.46]This is so stupid.
[162:36.84]Okay, you know what this looks like?
[162:39.91]What's that... What's that kid that dances?
[162:42.83]The kid that goes like...
[162:48.81]What is it?
[162:49.11]He's like... That's the first thing I thought of.
[162:53.85]Dwayne, that's right, yep.
[162:56.37]It's like... That's the first thing I thought of.
[163:06.26]It looks like somebody's, like, fucking threatening me to, like... Yeah, you're... Dance!
[163:13.64]Does it look like somebody's gonna fucking kill me off-camera?
[163:32.52]Dwayne!
[163:33.06]Alright, let's go.
[163:35.28]Let's do another one.
[163:36.06]This is fun.
[163:37.34]I like this one.
[163:38.10]Alright.
[163:41.28]How do we keep going?
[163:44.63]No!
[163:45.69]That was close.
[163:50.65]Oh, round two.
[164:01.26]Which one am I?
[164:42.49]I got him.
[164:52.02]OK.
[164:52.32]That was easy.
[165:18.02]Jesus.
[165:18.40]I got it, cleared it.
[165:27.06]Photos time.
[165:43.44]Dump truck.
[165:52.85]Oh my god.
[165:53.89]This is... Guys, it looks like I'm wearing a rubber mask of somebody else's face.
[166:09.20]That's a fucking rubber mask.
[166:23.35]Okay, this is just like a shitty... This is one of my model photos that I uploaded to like Instagram to show you like how much of a model I could be.
[166:38.03]Underneath this is like, there's two like...
[166:50.35]Yeah, it's my gallery.
[166:52.03]You know, my model gallery.
[167:02.49]That one's not even that bad.
[167:03.57]This one looks kind of bad.
[167:13.47]I don't like that one.
[167:14.11]It's scary.
[167:15.45]It's a scary image.
[167:35.00]Why does it always look like somebody took like ice cold hands and like put them on my back?
[167:49.80]Alright, let's go again.
[167:50.75]Round 5.
[167:55.81]No, round 3!
[168:03.45]Theresa May?
[168:13.46]That's fucking perfect.
[168:17.57]Oh my god.
[169:02.21]I think I see when it takes the photo.
[169:43.70]I had to go all the way over to the dog bed!
[169:48.48]Why was that so far away?
[170:12.00]Very very weird.
[170:16.18]I look jacked.
[170:17.00]I look huge in this picture.
[170:27.84]What's going on with my face?
[170:33.86]Just the Reddit shelf.
[170:35.90]Just right here.
[170:37.40]It's the only thing in the entire fucking room.
[170:40.96]It just looks so odd.
[170:46.09]There's like shit all over the floor.
[171:04.92]Somebody came in the room.
[171:06.48]The T-Rex walked in.
[171:07.68]It didn't matter what I was doing.
[171:09.58]I had to be very still or I was dead.
[171:13.47]Or you don't have a place to put your cardboard cutout of Jerma985.
[171:18.49]I guess it's just gonna go over here and lean against the wall while I clean the fucking room.
[171:25.64]Like, this is like you shoved the cardboard cutout of me and all the other junk so you can vacuum over here.
[171:42.73]That was it.
[171:43.09]That was the last one.
[171:49.69]Here comes the final.
[171:51.39]See if I can get it.
[171:52.61]The proudest possession.
[171:53.35]New rule?
[171:54.05]What?
[171:54.35]What are you talking about?
[171:56.22]The holes aren't visible?
[172:19.65]Oh, Jesus.
[172:27.77]Now, it's time to face the final hold.
[172:30.85]Which one is it?
[172:39.29]Which one is it?
[172:40.12]Great.
[173:12.06]Easy!
[173:24.93]Well done!
[173:34.72]Let's start this one!
[173:37.12]I'm gonna fall over!
[173:48.90]I can't...
[174:24.94]Otto is gonna be in one of these pictures I think.
[174:28.38]Otto came in.
[174:29.48]Let's see if we can see Otto.
[174:45.35]He like ran over here.
[174:46.29]Oh my god, another cardboard cutout.
[175:01.43]Can you imagine?
[175:02.35]Just like a fucking sprite in my hand.
[175:04.27]In like the 7-Eleven.
[175:07.47]I'm trying to find Otto.
[175:37.27]Oh, if you had friends over and these were saved.
[175:44.31]Dad just still playing with the Kinect.
[175:47.27]Oh, that's where I didn't know where it was.
[175:48.85]I can get it.
[175:52.81]I'll try it again.
[175:53.31]Let's go.
[175:58.10]I can do it.
[176:03.17]Oh, the show is over!
[176:05.75]What?
[176:06.09]Can I restart that one?
[176:09.75]Oh, God!
[176:22.50]What the fuck?
[176:23.20]Come on.
[176:25.54]Next game?
[176:29.32]Hold on.
[176:29.92]Not yet.
[176:34.05]I want to pick another one.
[176:39.45]I can't believe I failed it.
[176:40.31]I'm going to blow through this.
[176:47.88]Let's see if I can catch the camera.
[176:51.04]When does it flash?
[176:56.58]Did I get it?
[177:30.56]These are easy.
[177:33.04]Kubrick Stare?
[177:40.36]I'm trying to think of, here's what I'm gonna do, ready?
[177:49.93]No, when does it take the photo?
[177:54.65]At some point, I gotta do a count.
[177:58.78]Maybe three seconds after?
[177:59.76]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[178:12.48]I wanna unlock the next one.
[178:22.13]I want to unlock the next challenge, at least.
[178:25.77]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[178:31.19]It turns gray?
[178:40.39]It looks like right there, right?
[178:41.89]I don't think that's correct, though.
[179:40.02]Oh shit, I'm not gonna get it.
[179:55.88]Take a look and see if we can get it.
[179:57.46]Is it that flash?
[179:58.44]I feel like it- is it?
[179:59.28]Let's find out.
[179:59.90]Is my tongue sticking out?
[180:04.23]No, it's not.
[180:05.81]So it happens before the flash.
[180:10.61]Yeah.
[180:11.49]It happens at some point before the flash.
[180:13.23]So here's what I'm gonna do.
[180:15.47]Check this out.
[180:22.08]See if I can get the photo and then do the actual thing.
[180:23.80]Here we go, ready?
[180:30.92]It's time to face the horde!
[180:38.89]Doesn't want me to do it.
[181:10.92]Okay, it was very easy.
[181:43.68]Come on, dude!
[181:44.54]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[181:52.69]Alright.
[181:55.15]See if I got it.
[181:59.45]This dude's a gamer.
[182:00.45]Thank you.
[182:00.75]Appreciate that.
[182:06.57]Help.
[182:08.79]It must start to take it when the time- when the do-do-do-do-do-do thing starts.
[182:17.95]Alright, this is it.
[182:19.25]This is through everything.
[182:19.97]Let's go.
[182:23.15]And now comes the final round of the Everyday Show.
[182:26.57]We've added an additional rule to make it harder.
[182:30.77]Have you ever felt lost in... I'm not in the shoes here.
[182:40.72]Now, it's time to face the...
[182:58.56]He's strangled.
[183:03.29]What?
[183:04.87]Congratulations.
[183:05.71]Great.
[183:12.03]Nice.
[183:30.86]Ah!
[183:36.52]You!
[183:37.60]Fuck!
[183:40.58]Fuck!
[183:40.94]Eee!
[184:36.55]Gray?
[184:36.87]What do you mean the gray?
[184:39.17]The gray shadow.
[184:42.95]I can't see that far away from here.
[184:45.49]I want a 27-inch monitor and I'm like 12 feet away.
[184:53.06]The gray silhouette, that's what it is the whole time?
[184:54.60]Are you fucking kidding me?
[184:56.44]I want to see this one.
[185:07.13]I'm like... Diver?
[185:11.11]I'm like... You're supposed to play this in the living room.
[185:16.03]This is like a 26 inch monitor and I'm like fucking 15 feet away.
[185:41.02]Come on!
[185:43.78]Quick survival.
[185:46.84]At least one gamer is not signed in, don't care.
[185:51.49]Go vibe check?
[185:52.25]Let's see.
[186:09.24]In quick survival mode, there's an unlimited number of walls.
[186:22.04]Now, it's time to face the horde.
[186:31.78]Unlimited number of walls?
[186:48.08]I think I've seen this already.
[186:53.69]He's... God damn it, I missed this.
[187:07.35]It's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
[187:34.96]I got it.
[187:35.48]How many of these do I have to do in a row?
[187:39.60]I've seen this already.
[187:41.64]How many times do I have to take a shower?
[188:22.63]It's lagging.
[188:59.67]Am I stuck here forever doing like the business ban at the sidewalk?
[189:08.94]How is he holding the briefcase?
[189:10.34]Alright, I've got ten more of these and if I don't see a new one I'm stopping.
[189:39.03]Alright, I'm done.

[189:50.33]I'm trapped here.
[189:55.19]I'm done.
[189:56.00]I'm done.
[189:59.22]I'm done.
[190:00.88]I'm done.
[190:01.40]Play until it crashes.
[190:07.00]I lost.
[190:28.25]We got no pictures either.
[190:29.50]Alright.
[190:33.66]Time to bring out a big gun.
[190:37.90]Time to play you're in the movies.
[190:44.79]We're gonna do like a few movies.
[190:50.21]Where'd it go?
[190:59.08]Happy You're in the Movies.
[191:05.71]Actually, let me get some water.
[191:07.23]We'll take one last break.
[191:08.63]Oh, sorry.
[191:08.93]I'm like pumping you.
[191:10.07]I'm going to be right back.
[191:11.27]Get some water and we'll do You're in the Movies.
[194:36.74]Ladies and gentlemen, I might have to tell you, Disappointment Andy might be coming up here.
[194:41.30]I might have to postpone this.
[194:45.26]You're in the movies.
[194:47.44]I completely forgot.
[194:48.56]You're in the movies.
[194:49.54]I had a green screen behind me last time.
[194:52.38]Remember?
[194:54.08]I'm not sure we're going to get a good picture here.
[194:57.48]I might need a green screen and some lights.
[194:58.98]We'll see if it looks alright.
[195:10.49]Don't need that.
[195:11.37]Oh, just we might.
[195:14.33]I might not even show up.
[195:22.18]Let's find out.
[195:34.29]Normal people don't have green screens, though.
[195:35.95]I mean...
[195:40.69]Do you want it to look good, or do you want it to just exist?
[195:44.19]You know what I'm saying?
[195:45.51]It might be very bad.
[195:46.46]We'll find out.
[195:50.70]Normal people don't have K'nex either.
[195:56.82]We just want it to exist.
[196:02.13]Alright, let's see what happens.
[196:07.57]It was a day like any other day.
[196:11.09]I don't know.
[196:12.03]That sequel's never as good as the original.
[196:14.27]I don't know if I like that.
[196:15.27]I don't know if I want to do that.
[196:16.19]Oh, the camera loves you.
[196:19.93]In terror as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc.
[196:24.57]Do I look fair?
[196:25.91]No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it.
[196:31.84]Can mankind use science to fight nature with nature?
[196:38.53]I fucking hate headphones.
[196:43.49]So much.
[196:45.35]When can I get, like, the chip implanted in here so I can just go, and there's, like, audio.
[196:48.85]Like, I hate this shit.
[196:49.83]I feel like I'm going on a goddamn scuba dive expedition when I put earphones in.
[196:54.69]Like... I fucking hate headphones so much.
[197:14.29]It's not a Kinect game.
[197:17.95]Come on!
[197:35.55]Where is it?
[197:36.97]Where's my Xbox Vision camera?
[197:56.15]Oh no.
[197:56.99]Oh no!
[197:58.15]No!
[197:58.75]Where's my Xbox Vision camera?
[198:37.30]I know myself so well.
[198:40.51]I know myself so well.
[198:43.59]Do you know how well I know myself?
[198:46.07]Would you like to know how well I know myself?
[198:48.83]Let me go ahead and show you.
[198:50.47]So, Xbox Live Vision Camera.
[198:52.42]I streamed this like two fucking years ago.
[198:54.58]Like a year and a half ago at least, right?
[198:57.04]I had the Xbox Live Vision Camera.
[199:00.08]Now you need that peripheral.
[199:01.18]It's an old shit peripheral.
[199:03.59]And I somehow, in my like drunken ADHD, I was like, you know what I have to fucking do?
[199:10.28]You know what I have to fucking do?
[199:11.34]I have to make sure that I buy two of these.
[199:15.42]Because I'm going to lose one.
[199:26.13]I've got a sealed in the box Xbox Live Vision camera.
[199:32.24]Because I was like, you know what?
[199:33.18]Might as well just get two because I'm a fucking idiot.
[199:40.39]Sell it?
[199:42.97]What?
[199:45.45]I've had this in a box in my closet for two years.
[199:51.09]Can I even do this right now?
[199:55.95]Alright.
[199:59.34]Should I try to find the first... Wait, should I open this first or... Actually sell it?
[200:08.13]Fuck.
[200:20.60]It's an easy $12.
[200:21.50]No, no, no.
[200:22.28]This is not $12, dude.
[200:23.56]Oh my god, I just punched you.
[200:24.56]I'm so sorry.
[200:26.06]They're not expensive?
[200:26.74]Yes, they are.
[200:28.51]You know how much an Xbox Live Vision Camera sealed is?
[200:31.81]Xbox Live Vision Camera.
[200:35.84]This shit is expensive.
[200:38.70]It is.
[200:44.24]I think this stuff, I think this is like $150.
[200:45.50]Dude, it's $50 and it's only $8.
[201:05.35]I'm gonna get a pair of scissors.
[201:08.57]I'm gonna get hurt trying to open this.
[201:10.51]It's the old clamshell, like, get stabbed packaging.
[201:18.55]Ow!
[201:22.01]Hold on.
[201:22.59]Let me get a pair of... Ow!
[201:29.59]Ow!

[201:36.87]Ouch.
[201:39.31]Ow.
[201:43.60]Ow.
[201:44.16]Stop, what?
[201:50.84]Ow.
[201:53.54]Okay, let me show you this.
[201:55.04]This is, like, fucking glass.
[201:56.80]Like, what were they thinking?
[201:58.86]What were they actually thinking?
[202:01.34]This is, like... This is fucking glass.
[202:07.45]Look at this.
[202:10.37]This is glass.
[202:13.93]This is, like, you're gonna get, like, cut.
[202:16.63]I can't.
[202:18.07]I thought this was a fucking Kinect game.
[202:19.42]Give me a minute.
[203:53.25]Dude, I'm telling you right now.
[203:55.66]How did this last for this long?
[203:58.16]You know what I mean?
[204:01.74]How the fuck did this last this long for this shit to be like this?
[204:06.82]If I'm a congress member or something, the first time I open a package like this, the next day I'm being like, this shit's fucking illegal now.
[204:21.16]This clamshell patches, this is fucking insane.
[204:25.14]Like, what the fuck were they thinking?
[204:28.06]They got out of their minds.
[204:34.46]I've got tools here, I've got a fucking tool here.
[204:50.06]I would have put a bill on the table.
[204:51.80]That was... You put something in clamshell packaging.
[204:57.54]The company is fined 500 fucking quadrillion dollars.
[205:02.35]Ain't never gonna do it again.
[205:03.31]Ah, that could have hurt me.
[205:11.79]Alright, I'm in.
[205:20.34]Merry Christmas!
[205:28.86]Where's our headset?
[205:36.51]What's our headset in here?
[205:51.09]Put it on?
[205:52.17]Let's start.
[205:53.77]I have to plug in the camera first.
[205:55.35]Wait.
[205:56.15]Oh no, this ain't gonna fucking work!
[205:58.03]Cause I need to like- this- look at this little stand.
[206:00.72]This ain't gonna fit anywhere.
[206:02.04]It's just- this ain't gonna happen.
[206:06.44]I don't- I- wait can I put- I think I can put it on top of the Kinect.
[206:08.72]Let me see if I can get it on top of the Kinect.
[206:13.68]It's the last time I actually taped it to the top of my monitor.
[206:20.18]See if I can get it to stand on the connector.
[206:27.89]We're good.
[206:28.65]We're good, it's on.
[206:31.65]Plug it in.
[206:49.09]Alright, hold on.
[206:50.31]Let me VRB.
[206:51.67]One more time.
[206:54.21]The ring on top of there.

[207:25.78]Looks like it's on Holy shit, this looks horrible Welcome to you're in the movies the game that makes you into a star.
[207:51.89]Are you ready to start making movies?
[208:05.15]It's like, yeah, it's like 10p.
[208:06.75]Wipe it off?
[208:07.39]Is it dead pixels on this thing?
[208:19.04]There are dead pixels.
[208:21.90]Alright, hold on.
[208:22.94]Movie theater.
[208:24.38]Make a movie.
[208:32.20]Oh no!
[208:37.79]Fuck!
[208:38.39]Did the save... No, no, no, no, no.
[208:40.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[208:41.51]I'm on David.
[208:42.21]I'm on David.
[208:46.04]Let's check our equipment.
[208:47.20]No, it's not in focus.
[208:49.76]Turn the ring on your camera until the picture is in focus.
[208:54.09]Then, press A when you're happy.
[209:11.48]There's a dead pixel.
[209:12.36]There's like five dead pixels.
[209:23.76]Is the lighting okay in here?
[209:25.34]Yes.
[209:25.84]Check the light meter to be sure.
[209:29.24]Now, let's position the camera.
[209:31.64]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline.
[209:36.10]Welcome to the Cutout Studio.
[209:39.41]Need a green screen!
[210:10.00]Are you sure you want it to exist?
[210:13.00]Are you positive?
[210:14.02]You can't even see me.
[210:23.63]No, no, it's got to be better than that.
[210:25.67]It's got to be better.
[210:26.61]I'm candidate.
[210:28.33]I'm candidate.
[210:28.87]We're going to do this again another day.
[210:31.98]Take your shirt off.
[210:32.76]That actually probably would help.
[210:40.35]Oh, what am I doing?
[210:41.03]What the fuck am I doing?
[210:42.05]The audio?
[210:50.32]It's like eating my whole face too.
[211:00.15]No, this ain't gonna work.
[211:02.63]Not gonna work.
[211:03.47]I'm gonna set this up so we can do it for real.
[211:14.76]It does work.
[211:17.94]Holy shit, there's a lion.
[211:19.00]Put a blanket up.
[211:21.40]I put a blanket up?
[211:23.43]It's gonna take like fucking 30 minutes for me to get a blanket and put it up.
[211:26.61]I don't have a blanket that can go up there.
[211:30.05]Press R or B. I've been going to different cutout styles.
[211:34.39]I'm gonna call it here.
[211:35.67]I wanna get this ready.
[211:43.70]That just made me depressed.
[211:47.84]I'm looking- I thought this was a Kinect game.
[212:04.49]But wait, hold on a minute.
[212:05.33]Oh, this one sucks.
[212:13.25]Do you see yourself clearly in the background?
[212:14.77]No.
[212:18.00]Great!
[212:19.00]Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.
[212:24.12]Please, hold on.
[212:26.98]Cutout complete!
[212:29.05]Now, get back in front of the camera.
[212:31.27]Try playing around with the cutout style to see the best results.
[212:35.93]Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?
[212:51.09]I got a better shirt on?
[212:55.15]Hold on.
[213:47.67]Son, you forgot to turn your stream off.
[213:53.23]You forgot to turn off this fucking Xbox again.
[214:00.32]It's the shelf.
[214:01.10]It's not going to be possible to have a screen.
[214:06.92]Alright.
[214:13.24]Move the shelf.
[214:14.60]Move the camera.
[214:15.60]I got very much room.
[214:16.80]Remove the shelf.
[214:17.48]I can't just move a shelf.
[214:19.34]There's a shitload of stuff on here.
[214:20.78]I'll knock it over.
[214:21.61]Alright.
[214:25.45]I'm going to res... Alright.
[214:26.47]That's it.
[214:26.91]I'll see you guys later.
[214:28.61]I'll see you guys later.
[214:29.35]We tried.
[214:30.97]Great.
[214:32.02]Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.
[214:37.25]What?
[214:37.97]Very important.
[214:38.65]Goddammit, it's close, but it's not gonna work.
[214:42.35]Holy shit, my skin is fucking...
[215:15.15]I'll see you guys later.
[215:15.64]I'm done.
[215:18.40]That was fun.
[215:20.64]It's fun.
[215:21.26]I fucking drained all my batteries doing the UFC fight thing.
[215:34.71]I'll be live tomorrow.
[215:35.51]We'll do it tomorrow.
[215:36.98]Let me try to get it actually set up so we can do it tomorrow.
[215:47.02]Family Guy music.
[215:47.88]Alright, so I'm going to try to get this set up for tomorrow.
[215:51.52]If I don't like the way it looks, just keep an eye on the stuff.
[215:57.61]Because if I can't get this the way that I want it, then we'll do it again later with a proper screen.
[216:03.97]If not, then I'll be back in a couple of days.
[216:06.19]Okay?
[216:07.59]I'm going to try.
[216:07.99]Keep an eye on the stuff.
[216:10.58]It's to be determined.
[216:11.56]Tomorrow I'm going to get up early.
[216:13.16]See if I can get this to work.
[216:17.79]That was a lot of fun, though.
[216:20.53]McKnight sucks.
[216:21.97]What a fucking waste of... What a waste of... Should I be that harsh?
[216:30.17]I don't know if I should be that harsh.
[216:31.43]McKnight fucking sucks.
[216:39.80]Laughing my ass off.
[216:42.28]Yeah, alright.
[216:42.68]If it's not this tomorrow, then I will see you on...
[216:46.48]And I'll be very... You'll... Just keep it unassessive.
[216:48.94]If there's no stream tomorrow... Then we will be live... On... The... Alright, the 6th... I gotta plan this out here, because it's... Alright, the next stream is actually to be determined.
[217:06.00]Because the 6th is a big stream.
[217:09.06]And I gotta make sure that's ready to go.
[217:10.48]So, let's... There'll be another stream in the next few days.
[217:15.38]If you don't know, there's going to be a major stream on the 6th.
[217:20.04]You'll see what it is.
[217:21.82]Wonders of Archaeology.
[217:25.48]I just need to figure out, because there's like production shit that's going to be happening over the next like four or five days.
[217:31.92]And I kind of need to know exactly what's going on.
[217:33.74]So you'll see that.
[217:35.58]I would just keep an eye on the sus over the next day or two.
[217:37.77]I don't really know exactly when the next stream will be, but it will be within the next few days.
[217:41.05]To be determined.
[217:46.69]I will see you guys to be determined.
[217:52.75]Have a great rest of your night.
[217:53.59]I got to turn off this Family Guy music.
[217:56.75]We'll see you guys within the next few days.
[217:58.63]I'll see you soon.
[217:59.07]I just want to make sure I get this right.
[218:04.59]That same monkey, he has the bananas.
[218:11.49]Thanks as always for watching, everybody.
[218:13.67]I'm going to go take a shower or a bath or either or.
[218:18.67]And I think the Kinect is going to get punted as far as I can get it.
[218:24.13]Where stream heart?
[218:25.23]I don't believe that's accurate.
[218:29.03]I don't think that's accurate.
[218:30.15]I don't think that's accurate.
[218:32.39]I had a lot of fun on this stream.
[218:33.49]Usually I can tell.
[218:46.16]And that guy.
[218:46.90]No, you can't.
[218:47.50]You're not going to get banned for having an opinion on whether a stream was good or not.
[218:52.06]I mean, I'll call you a fucking dick.
[218:54.99]You're not going to get banned.
[219:03.89]Alright, let us hold on a second here.
[219:19.65]Do a raid?
[219:20.57]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[219:32.28]Ster is RPing right now?
[219:33.92]Oh my god, are you serious?
[219:37.48]Alright, I'm gonna, let's raid Ster.
[219:39.88]I'm very curious, because I, let's see how GTA RP is.
[219:45.16]It stirs RPing right now.
[219:47.48]He's not going to sing you a raid song.
[219:50.50]He's in the middle of RPing.
[219:54.60]Let him RP.
[219:59.90]If he's in the middle of a routine or something, it's all good.
[220:03.44]Let's see how he does.
[220:05.30]Be nice.
[220:08.57]I will see you guys in the next few days.
[220:12.67]Take care of yourselves.
[220:14.65]See you soon.
[220:16.62]And good night.
