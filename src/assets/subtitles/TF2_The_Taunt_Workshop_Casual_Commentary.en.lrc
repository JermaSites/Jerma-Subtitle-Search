[00:09.02]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.70]Gerber here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.75]And tonight...
[00:15.63]Gonna be playing as the Demoman.
[00:18.91]So what I want to talk about in this video is something that has been posted on the blog, the Team Fortress 2 blog, and it's something I'm really excited for, and you should be too if you're a fan of Team Fortress 2, and that is because it's a content update.
[00:32.93]It's gonna be a somewhat major content update.
[00:35.39]They're working on some things.
[00:37.07]I don't know if this has anything to do with End of the Line,
[00:41.15]End of the Line is supposed to be mostly a community-driven effort, so I don't know.
[00:44.60]All we know is there's a blog post saying, hey, everybody, we got some new shit coming, and that makes me excited.
[00:51.74]And firstly, one of the main reasons why I'm so excited about this is because we might potentially be getting something that we have not received from Valve in just about two years of development on this game.
[01:04.29]And what is that thing you might ask?
[01:06.03]An officially made non-Man vs. Machine map added to the game.
[01:11.84]Now, I really kind of hope that this is not Man vs. Machine.
[01:16.08]As much as I like Man vs. Machine, as much as it added gameplay to T-Fortress 2, I'd actually like to see them make an old-school map, like an old game mode map, like a CP map or a new payload map.
[01:32.25]They haven't done that in so long, and we've gotten so many good community ones to fill the gap, and they've been made official by Valve, but Valve hasn't made one.
[01:40.71]in so long that even the notion that it could be happening has got me pretty excited.
[01:46.40]I just hope it's not Doomsday or Special Delivery, because how stupid would that be?
[01:51.70]How much would that suck if it was like, oh, we've made a new one since, like, 2012, and it's another fucking Doomsday.
[01:58.50]Happy Thanksgiving!
[02:00.52]Alright, we're going to move on.
[02:02.52]I want to talk about the second part that was teased in this little blog post about the taunts.
[02:07.55]About making taunts for the various characters.
[02:10.61]It's going to be coming to the workshop.
[02:12.21]A bunch of all these source filmmaker animators and all these guys that are really talented model makers.
[02:16.32]They're going to have more stuff to do.
[02:17.80]And I hope, I really hope,
[02:21.32]we can make our own taunt kills.
[02:23.52]How amazing is this system going to be if we can make these wacky, crazy, new taunt kills for the various classes?
[02:31.03]Because that's some of the most fun in this game.
[02:33.97]When you catch somebody around a corner or you see somebody that's not paying attention and you do one of those crazy, fun taunt kills,
[02:40.97]It adds almost another dimension to what this game is and what you can do and how you can have fun playing it.
[02:47.94]So I can just see the various things people will come up with for taunt kills, if it's allowed, hoping it is.
[02:54.72]I'm such a huge fan of the nonsensical, outrageous taunt kills, like the guitar smash with the engineer, the head slash with the Demoknight, the crazy home run bat with the scout.
[03:08.33]How funny would it be if we got to see somebody get kicked in the balls for a taunt kill?
[03:12.49]Just rear back and absolutely smash the person's nuts with your leg and foot.
[03:16.62]Like, that would be funny, would it not?
[03:20.10]And, like, you could give the animation.
[03:22.08]You could do animations for all the different characters getting kicked.
[03:25.29]And it would just be hilarious.
[03:26.45]I would love to do that.
[03:27.62]I would love to kick people in their balls.
[03:30.60]But regardless of my strange fantasies I'm laying out for you guys right now, you could do anything.
[03:37.26]You could do literally anything and there are so many different creative aspects to fun taunt kills and even just taunts in general.
[03:44.35]I'm really happy to see that they're gonna open up the animation side of things because for the longest time,
[03:51.05]it was never the animation stuff would come into Team Fortress 2.
[03:54.57]If you wanted to make some type of animation, it was a community thing, it was Source Filmmaker, you'd get some people to act out like a script or something, or you'd play up, it was cool in that regard.
[04:05.99]But now, instead of it just being models added to Team Fortress 2, you can animate for Team Fortress 2.
[04:13.19]And I've seen a lot of Source Filmmaker stuff, I've seen a lot of the Garry's Mod stuff, a lot of the creative stuff that you guys in the community, the Team Fortress community could come up with, and some of it's fucking really good.
[04:24.07]Some of it is really good, to the point where you say, man, you should really be doing this for Valve.
[04:29.82]You should really be making this type of content for Valve.
[04:33.32]You can do it now!
[04:34.44]And hopefully it gets into the workshop and goes through and goes into the game.
[04:38.32]And to end this video, I'm just going to very simply say, if this has to do with End of the Line, then I'm sure we'll hear more about that pretty soon.
[04:46.33]And if it doesn't, if this has nothing to do with End of the Line, then that's awesome too, because that means there's two different updates being worked on right now.
[04:54.60]So that's a good thing regardless of whatever update this update is going to be part of.
[05:00.53]So that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[05:01.77]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:02.85]Really do appreciate it.
[05:04.04]And before the video ends, I just want to very briefly say I'm going to be at PAX East this year.
[05:10.40]PAX East is April 11th through the 13th.
[05:14.34]So if you're going to PAX, I'm gonna be there.
[05:17.00]I'll be there all three days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[05:20.36]So if you wanna say hello, if you see me,
[05:22.78]Do not be afraid to wave me down or say hello or scream in my face.
[05:26.45]Either of those things, any of those things would be fine.
[05:29.43]I'm also going to be doing a meetup, which will probably be on Sunday.
[05:33.65]So if you're following me on Twitter, I will make a tweet saying like where I am on Sunday and what I'm going to be doing for like a little meetup.
[05:40.57]So if you don't follow me on Twitter, that's really the only place you will know what I'm doing.
[05:45.43]So I suggest you do that if you want to know where I'm going to be on Sunday.
[05:48.31]And that's going to wrap up the video.
[05:49.21]So thank you so much for watching.
[05:50.25]I really do appreciate it.
[05:51.17]And of course...
[05:52.73]Come and find me at PAX!
