[00:01.38]Hi, guys.
[00:04.26]Welcome to an oh-mega-late stream.
[00:11.93]You were here earlier.
[00:12.73]I had to change a few things because we have some interesting things going on tonight.
[00:17.67]There's always something interesting going on.
[00:21.94]There's always something different.
[00:24.18]Always something new going on here.
[00:27.82]Am I using a webcam mic?
[00:31.32]Am I?
[00:33.88]Hold on.
[00:37.66]Hello?
[00:39.81]Hello?
[00:40.41]Are we good?
[00:44.25]What mic was that?
[00:45.27]I don't know what mic that was.
[00:48.39]Okay, well, anyways, hi.
[00:50.72]Welcome to another edition.
[00:52.96]Go back.
[00:53.42]Oh, it was the VR mic!
[00:58.97]How is that picking me up from all the way over here?
[01:02.05]I have no idea.
[01:04.77]So let's go over a couple things.
[01:07.29]I'm not gonna tweet this out yet.
[01:08.31]I wanna make sure that the stream's gonna be stable.
[01:12.11]Because I'm currently downloading hundreds of gigabytes worth of data.
[01:19.47]And we'll explain it, we'll talk about it.
[01:24.16]Somebody just gave, speaking of hundreds, speaking of hundreds,
[01:29.29]Of gigabytes of data.
[01:32.23]Uh... I don't... Somebody just gave $200.
[01:42.23]That was Jerma's massive dong for two... $200.
[01:46.92]20,000 bits.
[01:48.14]They're just giving hundreds of dollars.
[01:54.52]This is just still happening right now, by the way.
[01:56.60]Like, this is another $100 just came in.
[01:57.96]$300 bucks.
[02:04.10]I don't even know how to react.
[02:05.01]This is insane.
[02:06.19]This is... 300 bucks right at the beginning.
[02:10.07]From Jeremy's massive dong.
[02:11.45]Well, um... He gave it to himself.
[02:15.47]I didn't... I didn't, uh... But thank you so much for the 300 fucking dollars.
[02:22.29]They say, I love you, Jeremy.
[02:23.19]You're the best.
[02:23.87]Been watching you since before.

[02:43.00]Thank you.
[02:45.84]But for what's going on today, after that gigantic blast out of money, why don't I tell you myself?
[02:56.78]Hey, how you doing?
[03:02.80]Okay, anyways.
[03:04.84]So, let me make sure one thing happens here.

[23:21.71]Alright, this is... Out of the hundred bucks.
[23:26.34]Jerma, I'm done giving money for now, but seriously, your videos and streams got me through some hard times that I could have never gotten through without you.
[23:32.00]Just wanted to say thank you for being you.
[23:33.26]So much love, a fellow gamer.
[23:37.61]That's... That's all you needed to say.
[23:43.01]Seriously.
[23:44.75]That's it.

[23:53.64]I buy a lot of Reese's.
[23:55.98]But for real, that's so much fucking money.
[24:01.94]I have nothing else to say besides I am fucking forever grateful that you would even consider even thinking for a second that some random guy on the internet deserves almost $2,000 of your money.
[24:12.07]And I can't even fucking comprehend it.
[24:14.59]Thank you so much for being part of the community.

[24:18.45]That's fucking intense, man.
[24:19.73]Like, I really, really hope that you can afford it, number one.
[24:23.59]And... I'm just glad that you have fun here.
[24:28.75]That's all I care about.
[24:29.77]So... I will put that money to good use.
[24:34.62]You just... You just yourself pretty much bought... Like, the dunk tank stream.
[24:39.26]Yeah.
[24:41.74]There it is.
[24:42.72]Like, seriously.
[24:45.90]Uh...
[24:47.97]Moving on from that, though, I'm forever grateful.
[24:49.93]Thank you.
[24:53.85]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[24:54.85]I didn't, like, talk about that yet.
[24:56.55]I talked about it a little bit at the end of the stream.
[24:58.90]You'll see it whenever, someday.
[25:00.82]But anyways, after that monumental amount of fucking money, what we're doing today.
[25:12.66]Hey.
[25:14.40]How are you?
[25:14.70]I'm talking to you.
[25:16.16]How you been?
[25:20.29]He's going to say it.
[25:20.97]He's finally going to say it.
[25:22.05]He's going to tell us.
[25:25.48]What we're doing today is I originally planned.
[25:27.76]So we were at VR last night.
[25:30.28]I wanted today to be kind of a chill stream.
[25:32.34]So around like, I don't know, 3 o'clock, I was going to just play, what's that video game?
[25:41.19]Western.
[25:42.91]Call of Juarez, right?
[25:43.45]We were going to play Call of Juarez.
[25:49.52]We're going to play Call of Juarez.
[25:51.84]But it turned out that Kryken sent me a message.
[25:57.20]And he said, hey, we've got some shit going on.
[25:59.73]If you want to play, we're going to do like Black Ops 3 Zombies modded.
[26:03.47]And I was like, alright, that sounds like fun.
[26:07.31]But they don't start streaming till like 20, 30 minutes from now.
[26:12.51]So I kind of had to push the stream back a little bit.
[26:14.97]This was kind of last minute, not even like 24 hours really, 12 hours or so.
[26:19.72]So I thought it would be fun.
[26:20.60]We're going to do Extreme Modded Black Ops 3.
[26:25.84]There's like 50 mods.
[26:37.45]Jervis Dong is average.
[26:43.79]People are giving more.
[26:45.75]So, before I address the more penis money that came in.
[26:51.97]The dong money that came in.
[27:08.40]This is like surging income right now.
[27:12.26]Do you understand?
[27:12.90]This is like, I should be performing heart surgery.
[27:24.32]I've lost, okay, hold on.
[27:25.90]But listen, so.
[27:28.02]Yesterday VR, I was going to chill a little bit today, but we're going to do another high-octane stream today.
[27:33.03]Crazy Black Ops 3 modded nonsense.
[27:35.87]It was like 100, 200, 300 gigs worth of stuff.
[27:37.31]I don't even know what the fuck it's going to be.
[27:39.23]It's going to be insane.
[27:40.45]That's happening very soon.
[27:41.29]We're just going to hang out until then.
[27:42.73]Tomorrow, Call of Juarez.
[27:44.51]Might beat the whole game.
[27:45.21]I don't know.
[27:45.53]Might not.
[27:46.07]Might give up halfway through.
[27:47.71]Might beat the whole thing.
[27:48.95]Friday.
[27:50.09]That's right.
[27:50.67]Going four days in a row.
[27:51.71]Four days in a row of streams here.
[27:53.55]Friday after like 6 o'clock, because I've got an appointment that I have to do.
[27:58.82]So Friday at like 5, 6 plus o'clock, I'm just going to turn it off.
[28:02.74]And we're going to hang out and have fun.
[28:06.22]I have an appointment.
[28:09.13]So we're going to do four days in a row because after Friday, I'm going to be gone for a little under a week.
[28:17.51]My mother's coming in.
[28:25.51]You know.
[28:27.17]Gotta hang out with my mother.
[28:28.27]It's been like seven months.
[28:32.25]Witch Call Juarez.
[28:33.29]Gunslinger.
[28:35.03]Tried to play it a long time ago and it just didn't work out.
[28:40.09]But I will be gone from Saturday-ish all the way through into like potentially Thursday.
[28:48.97]Like Wednesday to Thursday, depending.
[28:51.41]So I'll be gone for about five days straight.
[28:54.09]Give or take.
[28:55.07]I'll let you know.
[28:57.42]He still hasn't started to play the game.
[28:59.10]I have to wait.
[28:59.76]I have to wait for Criken and Nova.
[29:03.15]They don't start for another 20 minutes.
[29:04.59]So we're just hanging out to begin with.
[29:07.97]Why is it so laggy?
[29:09.49]You see that?
[29:12.13]Hold on.
[29:20.04]It shouldn't be laggy like this.
[29:22.60]There we go.
[29:22.98]OK.
[29:24.62]I think we were going to set up a little.
[29:26.85]I have everything installed now.
[29:30.07]Let me just get in there and see if it worked.
[29:32.55]Dude, they're already playing it.
[29:37.29]Imagine if they, like, lied to me.
[29:41.87]Imagine they're like, yeah, man, get it.
[29:43.27]It's like a bunch of gigs.
[29:45.63]And I'm like, oh, yeah, gigs.
[29:47.07]And I download all this shit and they just, like, stop playing without me.
[29:50.33]And they just pretend I'm, like, not here.
[29:55.67]But we had... Before, I'm going to open up the game.
[29:58.21]I'm sorry that I'm kind of stalling and a lot of money came in.
[30:03.55]You guys are fucking too much.
[30:05.01]Thank you.
[30:06.05]Turtle toenail, $50.
[30:07.44]Stop talking about the stream.
[30:08.70]What?
[30:10.00]Jerma's dong is average.
[30:11.14]Thank you.
[30:14.62]Magellan, thanks for the $50.
[30:15.64]Fine, you got me.
[30:16.96]Take my money for real, though.
[30:17.84]Forever grateful for your content and will forever... Will be.
[30:22.41]I'm forever grateful for the fact that you're watching and you're here.
[30:24.97]So... You guys have made my... Literally my dreams of, like, when I was 12 come true.
[30:31.31]So thank you for that.
[30:33.84]The counter is all fucked up.
[30:34.78]It's gonna be broken for, like, the next, like, 30 minutes.
[30:39.24]Everything I've ever wanted to do in my life, it's, like, what I... You guys are fulfilling that dream.
[30:43.00]So I have you to thank for that one.
[30:49.02]But let's open it up.
[30:50.52]Let me get out of here.
[30:51.31]Let me open up Black Ops.
[30:54.55]I have never even played this before.
[30:57.25]Guys, I don't even know how to play zombies.
[30:59.79]I'm going to be such a piece of crap this stream.
[31:03.54]I've never played a game of zombies in my life.
[31:13.92]But thank you so much again to Jervis Massive Dong.
[31:22.51]You are too fucking generous.
[31:23.79]Alright, let's open this up.
[31:29.41]Black Ops 3.
[31:33.97]Might be loud.
[31:34.47]I hope it's not loud.
[31:35.15]Yeah, they're gonna have to give me like a crash course in this game because I have no idea how to play it.
[31:42.94]Play online multiplayer to warm up.
[31:50.82]I think Criken is in the streaming channel.
[31:53.74]I wonder what that means.
[31:57.20]Imagine thanking your own dong.
[32:02.99]I know, it's weird.
[32:06.97]Yeah, but how could I warm up?
[32:08.17]Does anybody play Black Ops?
[32:10.29]I thought that was like a joke.
[32:16.62]How do I turn off the Discord overlay?
[32:18.34]Oh, there we go.
[32:26.51]Yeah, wasn't there a meme before that only eight people had this on PC or something?
[32:34.37]Why can I not hear this?
[32:37.67]Why would this be coming through my BenQ monitor?
[32:40.32]What the fuck?
[32:42.96]We saw that you had a BenQ monitor plugged in.
[32:45.05]You want it to come through the non-speakers?
[32:48.77]There we go.
[32:52.21]So let's get this captured.
[32:54.91]It's a PC game, that sure is.
[33:02.56]Hey, there we go.
[33:03.12]Look at that.
[33:04.92]Hey, do you want to open the store?
[33:09.10]Crican?
[33:09.84]There it is.
[33:10.34]It's Crican.
[33:11.93]Hey, Criken, can you hear me?
[33:14.15]Criken?
[33:15.17]He can't hear me.
[33:16.59]Oh no, he has AirPods in.
[33:17.69]Criken!
[33:20.75]I hope I downloaded all this shit right.
[33:27.35]It wasn't three.
[33:28.49]It was way more than three.
[33:31.03]Hold on a second.
[33:33.27]Wait a second.
[33:37.37]Wait a minute, hold on.
[33:45.65]It was like 50!
[33:48.51]Why are you just downloading- no, no, I have- I should have them all!
[33:52.17]I downloaded them- dude, it took like two hours to download all these!
[33:56.21]What was that?
[33:56.81]I was just fucking- Maps only show up in zombies.
[34:08.36]Okay, okay, okay.
[34:11.46]Alright!
[34:13.30]That's the default sound.
[34:14.60]I'm such a bad streamer.
[34:18.09]Is there any way I can make sure that I'm, like, subscribed to these?
[34:21.03]Let me see.
[34:22.67]It says I'm subscribed to all of them.
[34:26.32]Should I go?
[34:26.76]Is Criken streaming right now?
[34:29.52]Yeah, it says I have them all.
[34:30.44]Alright, I think I just panicked for no reason.
[34:47.04]What a first 35 minutes of the stream.
[34:50.04]My god.
[34:52.73]Alright, here we go.
[34:54.03]Let me get my settings correct.
[34:57.09]Should be starting very soon here.
[35:07.03]Stop giving yourselves a bunch of donations.
[35:11.45]Treyarch.
[35:15.08]I'm surprised I actually have Call of Duty installed.
[35:23.01]Re-chat, re-chat.
[35:24.23]I'm trying to set up a video game.
[35:26.13]2015?
[35:29.89]Oh, that's right.
[35:35.20]They made so many of these that I forget that they come out like every eight months.
[35:39.26]Okay, let's go to...
[35:42.69]I don't want to chat.
[35:43.75]Party privacy.
[35:44.65]I don't know what the fuck that means.
[35:52.20]Where's the settings?
[36:05.56]Is there a settings?
[36:08.92]Media options.
[36:10.22]What kind of menu is this?
[36:16.96]Did another $50 come in?
[36:19.82]Multiplayer.
[36:20.52]Alright.
[36:20.74]I'm going to... Let's get this down a little.
[36:23.00]Voice volume.
[36:23.72]That looks good.
[36:25.86]I can turn this up.
[36:26.80]I want to turn... Let me... Cinematics.
[36:28.75]Somebody wants to hear that.
[36:30.55]Subtitles on.
[36:33.07]Multiplayer music.
[36:33.99]Multiplayer dialogue.
[36:35.19]That's because it's Xbox.
[36:39.49]Okay.
[36:40.13]Graphics.
[36:40.65]Yeah, this is what I want.
[36:43.51]Windowed fullscreen...
[36:46.16]Yeah, RGB, field of view, excuse me.
[36:51.05]How dare you make that default at 80.
[36:53.83]Max frame to second, sync every frame, that's not what I want, right?
[36:56.45]Okay, that's better.
[37:07.45]Subtitles still off, that's alright.
[37:11.31]Extra quality?
[37:15.23]Stop the bits?
[37:15.95]No, this is just... Okay, look, I'll do this.
[37:19.57]Those are all late coming in.
[37:23.46]You can tell the money's just going right to his fucking head.
[37:26.94]Game... Player name... What?
[37:29.04]What?
[37:34.15]I'm not gonna put full name.
[37:40.69]I don't want the people's full names.
[37:46.80]Oh, it's your player name.
[37:48.30]Oh, okay.
[37:52.02]Alright, I think I'm ready to... I think I'm ready to go!
[37:56.76]Should I go in here and just scream at Criken?
[38:01.06]Turn off motion blur.
[38:01.92]Oh yeah, that's right.
[38:04.52]Off.
[38:04.94]Disabled.
[38:06.08]Ambient occlusion.
[38:07.64]I don't think so.
[38:10.00]Dynamic shadow.
[38:11.29]Some of these are dumb, right?
[38:12.33]Which one of these is the dumb one?
[38:13.33]I know there's at least two or three dumb ones.
[38:23.37]Extra?
[38:24.88]No, this is dumb.
[38:27.22]I don't want any of these to be on it, like, that high.
[38:29.80]Because we're doing fucked up mods.
[38:31.48]They're gonna run like shit.
[38:35.88]A-O is the dumb one.
[38:37.38]Oh, okay.
[38:37.76]Alright, let's see if I can get in here and see what he says.
[38:45.00]I'm ready to see if we can pull him in.
[38:54.33]Hello?
[38:56.37]Hello?
[38:57.93]Hello?
[39:00.39]Hey.
[39:00.57]Hey.
[39:01.19]Hey, how are you?
[39:02.61]Hey.
[39:02.87]How are you, man?
[39:05.01]Is this where everyone in here is currently streaming?
[39:07.11]This is the waiting room, yeah.
[39:08.03]I'm actually about to deafen, but.
[39:09.29]Oh, OK, cool.
[39:10.65]Hey, yeah, this is the place to be.
[39:12.93]Yeah.
[39:13.51]I'm live right now.
[39:14.23]I'll be back in like, oh.
[39:16.51]Oh.
[39:17.61]Say something.
[39:17.97]Say something.
[39:18.31]Say something.
[39:18.75]Say something interesting.
[39:20.17]I gotta go.
[39:22.15]Oh, no.
[39:22.37]I'm fucking alone.
[39:24.78]That was tomato, by the way.
[39:26.54]Alright, so it's just me in here.
[39:28.40]Nope.
[39:29.86]Don't go into the auto-chess room.
[39:31.28]What?
[39:31.46]Alright, here we go.
[39:35.02]Alright, so.
[39:35.92]I said I was streaming and I scared him.
[39:38.70]Alright, so what can I do?
[39:58.32]What do I do?
[40:00.56]What do I do?
[40:01.20]I've just said... I've got to get the camera.
[40:02.81]Put the camera back on.
[40:03.49]Everyone loves a cam, right?
[40:09.77]I'm not going to play the campaign.
[40:20.34]Spend my COD points.
[40:21.58]I have 200.
[40:21.84]What does that get me?
[40:27.03]This is a Captain America t-shirt, guys.
[40:31.65]What are you talking about?
[40:43.92]Homestar Runner.
[40:45.00]It could be that, too.
[40:45.56]We're going to get started real soon here.
[40:54.71]What the fuck?
[40:56.92]Open a loot crate?
[40:58.12]No, because I don't want you guys... Wasn't there a thing where if you opened up a loot crate, somebody else could watch you opening loot crates?
[41:04.20]Was that this game or was that a different one?
[41:12.73]Dong's account is gone?
[41:14.83]Oh, Jesus.
[41:17.80]Well, I... I...
[41:22.26]I don't know what to say.
[41:23.54]I don't know what to do.
[41:25.06]I guess... We'll just see how that plays out, but... I snapped him.
[41:31.83]No, I didn't!
[41:43.91]Well, I don't know what happened to that, but I don't have much else to say, you know?
[41:48.12]That was fucking an insane amount of money.
[41:55.60]Criken's playing?
[41:57.60]I'm in the streaming channel right now with Criken and he's muted and he's deafened.
[42:01.52]He's doing an introduction.
[42:03.60]That's what I've been doing.
[42:04.62]This is just the introduction.
[42:06.26]This is my 43 minute introduction.
[42:15.97]Fix my sleeve.
[42:20.57]Where?
[42:20.93]What?
[42:32.03]What is wrong with you guys?
[42:34.43]What?
[42:36.73]Fix your... What the fuck?
[42:44.47]Like, that is like... Tiny sleeves.
[42:49.31]I know, this is like a... Look.
[42:51.41]You want to see how you make yourself look like a baby?
[42:53.44]Ready?
[42:53.72]Like, I got like big fucking shoulders, right?
[42:58.91]Criken sent you the collection, right?
[43:02.35]Yeah, I got it all downloaded, all installed, I hope.
[43:05.39]It was... All 800 gigabytes, I'm gonna assume.
[43:09.01]It was insane.
[43:11.04]I couldn't believe it.
[43:13.04]Almost every map in that thing is worth about two gigs a pop.
[43:19.62]I don't know why.
[43:21.60]Dude, I was telling my chat earlier before I started, it was like I was taking buckets of water and dumping them out of a sinking ship.
[43:28.38]I was just uninstalling things as it was going.
[43:31.26]Yeah, that's, I mean, think about it like this.
[43:34.01]I've had this shit on my computer for probably, like, the last two weeks while we've been planning on doing this again.
[43:40.85]So I've been watching this, like, tumor on my drive just getting bigger and bigger.
[43:45.56]Oh, my God.
[43:46.72]It's going to be insane when it's all removed.
[43:49.46]Yeah, I mean, honestly, half the stuff, I never cleaned out this collection from the last time we did it because we never got through all of it.
[43:54.46]Yeah.
[43:55.41]So like, it's like 50% trash, another 50% like actual levels.
[44:00.29]And about 50% of that is stuff we've already done, so it's actually just like.
[44:04.01]Alright, so how do I know if I have this installed correctly?
[44:06.96]Is there a way for me to like see it?
[44:10.68]Yeah, if you're on zombies.
[44:12.75]Hang on, I'm logging in as well.
[44:14.67]The easiest way is just to like join.
[44:16.09]Like go into the game personally, like a private zombies level.
[44:18.97]Okay, so like private game.
[44:21.09]Yeah, and just grab like Minecraft or something, man.
[44:24.70]Alright, so like change map.
[44:27.28]Yeah.
[44:28.78]Okay, I see like Star Wars, Minecraft...
[44:32.05]Just grab one.
[44:33.11]Star Wars works.
[44:34.73]Hey, hey, hey, don't look too much.
[44:36.99]Wait, what the fuck are these?
[44:38.87]Don't, hey, alright, just grab one.
[44:41.13]There's 70 files here.
[44:43.03]Hey, alright, just grab one.
[44:46.19]Launch it up and see if you like what you see or if it at least launches.
[44:50.43]What is, oh my God.
[44:51.61]Alright, I'm going to try, I'm going to try to launch.
[44:54.44]You said Minecraft.
[44:55.42]I'm going to just see if it launches.
[44:56.86]Get a Minecraft one.
[45:03.75]We're probably going to start with Monopoly again, though.
[45:06.27]Why did your voice do that?
[45:08.43]Huh?
[45:09.17]I forgot.
[45:09.65]It's an Activision game.
[45:11.27]It just makes everybody's voice a thousand times louder, doesn't it?
[45:14.04]Oh, fuck.
[45:16.04]Wait, did I do that or was it you?
[45:18.72]Wait, was it me or you?
[45:22.71]Hello!
[45:23.27]Hey!
[45:24.43]Hey!
[45:26.01]There's the guy.
[45:26.83]How you been?
[45:28.10]I've been great.
[45:28.90]How are you?
[45:30.12]I'm doing great.
[45:30.82]Sorry I kept you waiting here in this room for a bit.
[45:32.88]Are you okay?
[45:33.62]No, we're good.
[45:34.64]We're good.
[45:35.37]I'm just hanging out, just being a weirdo.
[45:38.29]A minute, my microphone.
[45:39.41]Oh, God, it does.
[45:40.53]Craig, you gotta be careful.
[45:41.69]This game, it does things.
[45:43.63]Oh, it boosts your mic?
[45:44.79]Yep.
[45:45.13]Oh, yeah.
[45:46.05]I just watched it at normal volume.
[45:48.49]The second I unmuted to tell you guys that it didn't boost, it boosted to 100.
[45:54.20]Oh, I remember.
[45:54.72]Yeah, okay.
[45:55.20]So, Jermo, would you prefer me to call you Jeremy or Jermo?
[45:59.10]I don't want to... You can call me anything you want.
[46:02.74]Anything you want.
[46:03.18]Alright.
[46:03.40]As long as it makes sense.
[46:06.45]Germtown, how about that?
[46:07.73]Yeah, that's good.
[46:08.39]So, okay, the map works.
[46:10.66]Cool.
[46:11.00]Well, which map?
[46:12.30]Oh, you guys are testing out one.
[46:13.46]I just had him pick a random one from the collection.
[46:15.76]Okay, cool.
[46:16.26]Because we can assume, as long as his drive wasn't full when he tried to install it, I mean, we'll see, because it sounds weird deleting as it was going.
[46:25.47]I was doing that.
[46:26.35]I was deleting as it was coming in.
[46:27.69]I was, like, laying down the tracks.
[46:29.41]It was, like, 10 gigs a second.
[46:31.13]It was, like, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[46:34.90]I was doing Jerma, but, like, the issue is that I didn't go through the collection Criken from last time to get rid of the stuff that we did and wouldn't go back to, so it's all just, like, still in there.
[46:42.22]Yeah, it's all just this messy pile.
[46:43.70]At this point, I mean, we forgot most of the shit we did last time, so I'll probably just, like, grab, like, stuff that still looks interesting, and we'll skip the shit that I know was complete, irrevocable garbage, you know?
[46:56.26]It's very awkward.
[46:56.92]Like, the pseudo-Voodoo one was never going to play that again.
[47:01.15]Oh, yeah, that one was fucked, dude.
[47:02.43]I couldn't find another one that was like that.
[47:04.15]Really?
[47:05.12]They're Pokémon that are zombies.
[47:07.92]No, there's definitely some weird ones.
[47:10.18]I did, like, a little look.
[47:11.40]There's one where you fight against rats, and I think you're supposed to be cats.
[47:14.16]I think I got that one.
[47:15.16]Okay.
[47:16.12]We got no, like, TOS violations in this, like, 70 mod hunt.
[47:20.76]Well, I grabbed a Game of Thrones one because I had to.
[47:24.91]Oh, yeah.
[47:25.55]Oh, that's topical, dude.
[47:26.59]That's going to be great.
[47:27.27]Yeah, I know exactly.
[47:28.79]Who do you think I am?
[47:30.36]Yeah, we're, you know, we're all about the clickbait here.
[47:33.76]We're just trying to capitalize on those trends.
[47:36.68]Why we're playing Black Ops 3.
[47:40.40]I was surprised with Black Ops 3.
[47:41.76]Didn't Black Ops, like, 7 come out, like, last week or something?
[47:44.84]But this is, for some reason, we're all just creating that.
[47:47.05]I'm surprised Criken managed to con you into joining.
[47:49.89]Yeah, I was just this morning.
[47:51.43]It was literally, like, just today.
[47:54.17]It was just like, do you want to do this?
[47:55.65]And I'm like...
[47:57.27]Yeah, I guess.
[47:58.91]Yeah, I'll spend 60 bucks on Black Ops 3.
[48:01.31]Every other person we messaged to play this actually, like, didn't talk to us.
[48:04.31]Yeah, everyone else said no, so thank you guys for... There's no, you know, there's no reason for that.
[48:10.56]You'll have a great time.
[48:11.38]I'll tell you that much.
[48:11.96]Let's see.
[48:12.76]We'll make it fun.
[48:14.36]It'll be fun.
[48:15.78]Have you met James, by the way, over at Happy Sonova?
[48:18.56]Oh, yeah.
[48:19.00]Oh, yeah.
[48:20.16]Hello?
[48:20.84]Hey, welcome.
[48:22.22]Sorry, I was muted.
[48:23.08]Oh, no.
[48:24.16]What is this?
[48:26.31]Where's this bit?
[48:27.53]What bit?
[48:27.99]What happened to you, buddy?
[48:30.33]What do you mean?
[48:31.29]Are you on pain meds or something?
[48:34.38]Does my voice sound fucked up?
[48:35.78]Yeah, it's a little weird.
[48:36.70]It's fucked up and loud.
[48:38.00]No, it's... Hold on one sec.
[48:41.68]No, is it?
[48:43.34]No, it's definitely pitched up.
[48:44.66]Why is it pitched up?
[48:51.85]I'm, like, having to, like, on the fly change everyone's audio levels.
[48:55.01]Yeah, everyone, when you turn on Black Ops, like, have your microphone properties open this whole stream.
[49:00.29]Oh, yeah, fun bit.
[49:02.01]Some of these maps will crash you, not for any of our fault, but just because they're bad.
[49:05.90]And when that happens, the game will auto-boost your mic to 100 again.
[49:09.98]So it's, like, an added fucking slap in the face.
[49:13.34]Also, full...
[49:14.82]disclosure to cover my own ass.
[49:17.00]I personally don't have the time to vet all these levels, so whatever we see in there is basically the extent of me scrolling to the comments and seeing if anyone yelled, holy shit, how'd this get on Steam?
[49:28.14]So, yeah.
[49:30.04]I also didn't get a button prepared for this one.
[49:32.48]I'm going to get a little bit of a scene change, you know, ready for this.
[49:37.27]Last time wasn't so bad.
[49:38.11]We played Monopoly.
[49:39.03]We played Minecraft.
[49:40.43]Is it working now?
[49:41.85]Oh, you're great now.
[49:45.66]except for the hicks legit oh Jesus what what's going on man what did you do to your mixer I don't know what's wrong with it you're you're 13. this is this is about it it's not a bit what's wrong with my voice dude I've heard you in real life this is not your voice what's it that laugh was on the fly
[50:10.09]What kind of computer do you have hooked up?
[50:12.02]I don't know how that computer works.
[50:13.66]Wait, can you guys still hear me?
[50:15.22]Yeah, we can hear you.
[50:16.44]Oh my God, it's Discord, dude.
[50:17.96]I closed Discord, but it's still up.
[50:19.90]It's like a ghost.
[50:22.00]Oh God, yeah.
[50:23.28]I don't recognize this person.
[50:24.68]It's really fucking me up.
[50:28.34]By the way, I sent you guys a squad invite, the new Twitch.
[50:31.82]Oh, squad.
[50:33.00]Wanted to do that.
[50:34.10]Oh wait, does that work?
[50:36.33]Oh, no, I tried it the other day, actually.
[50:39.65]Let's try it.
[50:42.59]So there's a squad.
[50:43.65]Oh, I see invite to the squad.
[50:45.73]I think people can watch all the chats and watch all the perspectives, and it's meant to be like a big happy family.
[50:53.64]I just hurt my mouth.
[50:55.67]Ow.
[50:57.97]You invited me and I clicked on it.
[50:59.23]It hurt my fucking mouth.
[51:01.33]I'm sorry.
[51:01.79]No, I just opened my jaw really fast.
[51:04.43]It was too fast.
[51:05.88]Because you're excited about the invite?
[51:07.28]Yeah.
[51:07.80]I just saw the invite.
[51:09.40]I pogged myself to death.
[51:13.24]We can't hear James anymore, so if he's... It happened the one time we spent... What the fuck?
[51:19.28]Hello?
[51:20.36]Yeah?
[51:21.26]How am I still in the call?
[51:22.26]Is it good?
[51:23.36]No.
[51:24.34]What the fuck, dude?
[51:26.31]I think it's starting to grow on me, though.
[51:30.09]Yeah, I kind of like this new James.
[51:32.55]It's getting worse.
[51:34.63]I don't know how to face it.
[51:36.19]It's definitely getting worse.
[51:37.25]By the minute, it's getting higher.
[51:40.00]Like a high wine.
[51:41.98]Oh, he's gone.
[51:42.50]Alright.
[51:43.20]Hopefully he's fixed it.
[51:44.04]This is fucking hilarious.
[51:45.56]Okay.
[51:46.16]Alright.
[51:46.42]So we get like in a team or something?
[51:48.29]Yeah, I'm making a lobby.
[51:49.43]Let's get in a team.
[51:51.19]Do you ever play Black Ops 3?
[51:52.69]Never.
[51:52.93]I've never even opened it.
[51:54.01]I don't even know how to play zombies.
[51:55.19]I've never even opened it.
[51:56.67]Oh, great.
[51:57.99]Alright.
[51:58.25]Cool.
[51:58.85]I played like the original Black Ops.
[52:00.43]I don't think I ever played until we did this like a couple months ago.
[52:04.31]I think we should know the song by the tomato because that was inspired.
[52:09.14]Yeah, we can grab one.
[52:10.87]You know how, like, those people, like, didn't respond or they didn't want to do it and, like, I did?
[52:14.66]I probably should have been one of those people that said no because I've never played zombies before in my life.
[52:19.28]Now you're here.
[52:20.88]Oh, God.
[52:21.88]I know the basics.
[52:23.18]Run in a circle and a crowd of people run behind you.
[52:26.13]Yeah.
[52:27.71]Except, yeah.
[52:28.67]That's it.
[52:29.37]I figured it out.
[52:30.74]Some of these maps also have additional objectives.
[52:33.24]I think one had us in Minecraft forge a diamond sword, which would let us progress in the level.
[52:42.45]We had one I saw was Black Ops WarioWare.
[52:48.25]So it's like, I guess there's mini games.
[52:50.15]I don't really know how that's going to work.
[52:51.43]This is going to be so odd.
[52:53.65]Yeah.
[52:54.05]No, we don't know what we're getting into.
[52:55.33]That's the whole point.
[52:56.59]It's like a roulette wheel.
[52:59.39]Cool.
[53:01.45]Oh my God, I opened up my Black Ops mod folder and it's this barren wasteland because the folder is somehow full even though it's not.
[53:09.74]Craig, you might have to do the first level without me while I speed them.
[53:12.16]Alright, so we're gonna invite?
[53:15.72]Do like a... I can give you the name of one of them.
[53:18.44]Okay.
[53:19.14]Hello, you sound good now.
[53:20.84]I'm good.
[53:21.26]No, you don't.
[53:24.17]No.
[53:24.47]No?
[53:25.39]No.
[53:26.91]Are you serious?
[53:28.13]It started alright and then it was like, no?
[53:30.33]Yeah.
[53:32.13]What the fuck, dude?
[53:33.47]I was told to deactivate my mic before, and that should have fixed it.
[53:37.79]This is crazy.
[53:38.69]Other people have had this before.
[53:40.09]I don't know how they fixed it.
[53:41.07]This is totally intentional.
[53:42.39]I can't believe it's not intentional.
[53:44.47]I mean, now it's getting a little bit to the length where it can't be intentional, you know?
[53:49.24]Any better?
[53:49.72]Or is it still the same?
[53:50.68]There it is.
[53:52.90]Yeah?
[53:53.52]Yeah, you're fixed.
[53:55.30]Legit?
[53:55.94]Yeah, you sound good.
[53:56.80]You sound great.
[53:57.66]All I did was disable it and re-enable it again.
[54:00.95]Well, there you go.
[54:02.31]That's all it takes.
[54:03.52]Turning it off and turning it back on.
[54:04.92]Hell yeah, dude.
[54:05.80]That's what the Comcast guy says.
[54:07.00]Unplug and plug it back in.
[54:09.28]Hot take.
[54:09.72]Do you want Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob Zombies?
[54:11.86]Do you want Cheese Cube 3?
[54:13.12]Do you want Dead Shit?
[54:14.00]Dude, how many fucking maps did you make me download?
[54:16.06]There was so many maps.
[54:17.37]It took me like two hours to fucking download all that.
[54:20.17]Do you want Cobra Kai?
[54:21.97]Do you want Farm?
[54:23.47]Do you want Minecraft?
[54:24.75]See?
[54:24.83]I told you guys.
[54:25.53]Minecraft.
[54:26.21]Minecraft.
[54:26.85]I told everybody that I was making it up.
[54:29.85]I picked multiple Minecraft levels.
[54:31.60]Yeah, I grabbed a lot because I knew this might happen.
[54:35.68]Okay, this one's called Minecraft, like, the fucking Jerma, like, nine.
[54:39.72]Ooh, yeah, try that one.
[54:41.04]That looks bad.
[54:41.66]I mean, I told you I didn't vet any of these, but sure.
[54:44.98]Yeah, let's hope this is good.
[54:46.38]Get your scene change ready for real.
[54:50.07]And... Wait, what do I have to do?
[54:52.81]Why do I have to do that?
[54:54.28]Do we have to, like, cut the black screen or something?
[54:57.86]No, I don't think it's ever going to get to that level.
[54:59.96]It probably won't be TOS.
[55:02.13]I can't imagine any of those.
[55:03.89]Like, all these levels aren't ones.
[55:05.15]These are all ones that people have played and voted for.
[55:08.33]There's titties in it?
[55:09.49]To some extent.
[55:10.29]Oh, yeah.
[55:10.55]You know?
[55:11.49]But we can't.
[55:12.19]What?
[55:12.55]I'm not saying there's not titties.
[55:13.70]You could get titties in a fucking zombies map?
[55:16.80]Dude, these are all modded.
[55:17.54]Oh, for sure.
[55:19.06]Mod map makers are historically just the strangest people in the world.
[55:23.20]Why didn't you just download the fucking titty ones then?
[55:26.69]We may have.
[55:27.29]You know, it's part of the excitement.
[55:29.33]It's like, you never know if you're gonna get titties or not.
[55:32.29]Why did I agree to this?
[55:34.05]I could have been playing Call of Juarez right now.
[55:37.53]I'm ready.
[55:38.58]Alright, I'm gonna invite you.
[55:41.25]Yeah, you guys do the first one without me while I power download the last of these maps, and I'll join for the next one.
[55:47.95]Can I have you guys on here?
[55:52.55]Did I make it in?
[55:53.15]Let's see.
[55:54.50]It says you're not in the game.
[55:56.68]Me?
[55:56.86]No, Jerma.
[55:58.34]I don't know about... I don't even see you online, James.
[56:03.02]Should I accept that you're in?
[56:04.32]No, I'm in the party.
[56:05.14]Jerma's in.
[56:05.52]Jerma's in.
[56:07.75]Okay.
[56:09.29]Alright.
[56:09.93]So let me get off camera now because I'm disgustingly ugly.
[56:14.55]Oh, don't say that.
[56:15.65]Alright.
[56:16.27]Wait, hold on.
[56:16.99]Is there anything I shouldn't be showing?
[56:18.25]Is it like passwords or something?
[56:19.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:20.76]Okay.
[56:21.75]No, the chances of anyone stumbling across our lobby is... It's impossible.
[56:26.34]These maps have been long hidden from the world.
[56:29.30]Long hidden.
[56:30.24]Hello?
[56:31.18]Hello.
[56:31.70]Hey.
[56:32.76]The game, like, cut my mic out for some reason.
[56:35.41]Oh, yeah, the game's going to fuck with your mic, 100%.
[56:37.17]Yeah, if it closes at all, you're going to need to go back into the properties and fix it.
[56:43.76]Alright.
[56:46.86]If the game closes?
[56:48.32]If it closes ever.
[56:49.76]If the game even opens and minimizes again, you're going to want to take a quick look.
[56:53.86]I feel like the game just, like, auto-adjusted your mic and made you, like, sound.
[56:57.93]Because it did.
[56:59.51]What?
[57:00.15]It'll do that.
[57:00.67]When you reopen it, it'll take control of your mic and it'll make you do things.
[57:04.03]It's a parasite.
[57:06.28]It's a parasite.
[57:07.52]You think I'm fucking around?
[57:08.92]Parasite!
[57:09.36]You guys don't understand.
[57:10.52]Wait, how do I fix this?
[57:12.18]You don't, you just try to live with it.
[57:14.12]You just gotta go in your mixer and change it afterwards once you get in.
[57:17.12]Oh my god.
[57:17.78]Didn't mean to call you a parasite.
[57:19.08]Really just fucking made you all like really quiet.
[57:24.18]This is, this is like akin to like video game archaeology.
[57:27.10]Like we're just, we're digging through the remains of this old game that no one plays anymore and we're finding these little gems from a like gone era.
[57:33.71]This is truly bizarre, dude.
[57:34.37]Okay, shift is run.
[57:36.37]Left click is shoot.
[57:37.86]Right click is melee.
[57:39.42]How do you do that?
[57:40.30]I don't play any of these.
[57:42.36]I'm going to be so lost.
[57:45.36]Do we even melee zombies?
[57:46.36]I guess you use the knife, right?
[57:48.58]Is right click melee?
[57:49.37]I don't think that's true.
[57:50.31]Right click is aim.
[57:51.03]Probably be like, what, F or something?
[57:54.07]It should be V or F, I think, for melee.
[57:57.99]It's easy.
[57:58.63]It's like, this was the first zombie game.
[58:01.51]So, you know, they all just kind of copy that.
[58:05.44]Play one, play them all.
[58:09.18]I'll, like, bump you guys up on everything else except for the game.
[58:15.03]Yeah, the game messes with your mic.
[58:18.73]So it blows us up, and then we have to turn each other down.
[58:21.65]If I minimize it, will it be fine?
[58:23.93]Yeah, it should be, if you can get to your mixer.
[58:27.59]Oh, there you are.
[58:28.43]Okay, I'm going to let you know, James.
[58:29.91]There's Fs?
[58:30.51]What the fuck?
[58:31.13]I see no Fs.
[58:34.31]Stop saying Fs.
[58:35.01]There's no Fs.
[58:35.61]I don't see any Fs.
[58:38.31]Y'all crazy.
[58:39.09]I think they're saying F for squad.
[58:42.37]Oh, did I never?
[58:43.39]Hold on.
[58:47.53]What a fucking confusing thing, man.
[58:50.17]Also, Criken, what the fuck have you done on that fucking RP server, my man?
[58:53.95]I've done some fucked up stuff, dude.
[58:55.61]Yeah, I fucking heard last night.
[58:59.63]They were telling stories about a crime bus.
[59:03.07]Yeah.
[59:03.43]Yeah.
[59:05.40]You know, like, you guys are like enemy.
[59:07.92]You're like public enemy number one on that server.
[59:10.82]We are?
[59:11.16]I didn't do anything.
[59:12.40]I've never committed a crime on that server.
[59:14.08]Yes, you are.
[59:15.18]Like, you're fucking, you're like known by everybody.
[59:17.70]I think every conversation that I had, they talk about the PP boys and like some of the shit you guys did.
[59:21.89]That's like how I guess I could gather some of the info.
[59:24.63]Got that scene switch ready.
[59:25.79]I told you.
[59:26.35]I'm prepared.
[59:26.61]You should accept the squad invite.
[59:27.93]Just testing it out to make sure it works.
[59:29.25]Launch it.
[59:31.68]You know what that is?
[59:32.66]No, I don't.
[59:33.64]If you go to your dashboard and you scroll down, there should be a squad stream section, and you just go to invites and hit accept.
[59:39.32]Oh shit, dude, this is revolutionary.
[59:42.07]Yeah, they have a pretty cool implementation.
[59:45.19]Nice, dude.
[59:47.75]Also, Jerma, dude, I love your fucking VR stuff that you've been doing as of late, man.
[59:52.39]It's a lot of fun, thanks.
[59:53.73]Some of the shit that you've been... Your green screen stuff that you were doing the one night?
[59:58.69]I was like, what the fuck is this?
[60:00.97]But it was so good.
[60:01.81]Yeah, the community came together and made some absolutely fucking hilarious things.
[60:11.44]I'm in squad mode, I guess.
[60:13.14]I've never done a squad mode.
[60:15.42]Do I get an achievement for that?
[60:16.78]Probably, dude.
[60:18.88]Put that on your jacket.
[60:21.74]Print out a little patch.
[60:25.23]I tried to put it on the next Twitch hoodie.
[60:29.93]Alright, I send you an invite.
[60:30.65]You should be able to join our lobby.
[60:32.07]Should I go change right now?
[60:34.00]I'll go put my Twitch shirt on.
[60:35.70]Oh, I got my Twitch hoodie right here, too.
[60:37.30]Is it on?
[60:38.52]Oh, my God.
[60:38.98]I threw it on the floor.
[60:39.80]I'll pick it up, though.
[60:41.00]Fuck.
[60:41.16]On the floor?
[60:41.97]On the floor?
[60:42.63]Oh, you hang it up, and you steam clean that and steam it every day.
[60:51.98]game and I ain't gonna go get mine I don't care hold on did I just like make him go get that I think we're all just being Twitch ambassadors right now Twitch ambassador no dude I'm a stream labs ambassador oh okay do you have a
[61:19.68]I have no idea how do I alt tab out of the game to fucking get to your guys's settings so I can bump you up?
[61:26.55]Just go to your like your windows mixer or go to Discord and click on it.
[61:29.51]I can't even click out of this wretched game.
[61:31.21]Black Ops ain't gonna like it if you try to leave.
[61:33.63]This wretched game.
[61:41.86]I haven't had that problem.
[61:43.82]Can you make it windowed mode instead of full screen?
[61:47.17]Where's the actual settings for Black Ops?
[61:51.05]Go to menu and then graphics from there.
[61:56.15]They have a borderless window.
[61:59.90]So that'll do it.
[62:04.54]We could start a map in the meantime.
[62:05.76]It's going to take you a bit.
[62:07.48]There's like fucking chunks in here.
[62:09.42]Yeah.
[62:11.14]Yeah, it'll take me like a couple more seconds to be ready to go because...
[62:15.45]My drive lied to me, but I'll be ready to go after, like, one map.
[62:20.75]Yeah, I mean, we can do whatever.
[62:27.03]How about this?
[62:27.87]You want Criken.
[62:28.45]Can you, like, just teach me how to play Black Ops zombies?
[62:30.66]Yeah, do like a warm-up.
[62:32.78]We'll start the map.
[62:34.34]I'll walk you around.
[62:35.32]I'll teach you the ropes.
[62:36.92]Yeah.
[62:37.26]And then, you know, bring on the horde.
[62:41.36]Yeah, of course.
[62:43.88]That's what we say when you're zombie hunting.
[62:45.42]You say, bring on the horde.
[62:47.02]This is Minecraft, zombies, Minecraft, but with zombies.
[62:50.96]What?
[62:52.28]Beta 0.15.
[62:54.18]They got a ways to go to release, but I have faith.
[62:58.28]I think they're going to get there.
[63:00.95]Beta 0.1.5.
[63:02.97]Let me go ahead and take a cursory check when that map was made for you guys.
[63:06.55]Yeah.
[63:08.69]Minecraft with an EI.
[63:11.32]Oh, this was released in beta form back in June 14th of 2017.
[63:17.40]So they didn't get the funding for this one.
[63:21.38]They weren't able to finish it up.
[63:22.75]One of these is gonna be a screamer.
[63:23.77]I just know it, I'm telling you.
[63:25.37]Isn't this nice?
[63:26.37]Look, it's like Minecraft, but also a little bit of zombies.
[63:29.95]It's not a 32-bit texture pack.
[63:31.25]Uh-oh, what's that over there?
[63:34.05]Hey, wait, are you already playing?
[63:35.25]I just fixed my stuff.
[63:36.32]What the fuck?
[63:37.06]We just started a map.
[63:38.18]I'm teaching this boy.
[63:39.20]He's never seen this on before.
[63:40.38]God dang it, dude.
[63:41.30]I'm going to join in progress.
[63:46.32]Man, he's a natural.
[63:47.30]Look, he's already doing it.
[63:49.22]Headshots only.
[63:49.84]So actually, on the first wave, you're going to want to use the knife.
[63:53.65]It gets you more money.
[63:55.79]Oh, that's grenade.
[63:57.75]It's a V. V is the knife.
[64:00.51]V. It's as if somebody shakes your head.
[64:05.22]Are you teaching him how to just play, like, zombies legit?
[64:07.62]He's never played zombies?
[64:08.71]I've never played zombies in my life.
[64:11.03]This is gonna be a great first experience.
[64:13.35]Ever.
[64:13.77]I mean, like, ever.
[64:14.63]Custom maps.
[64:16.57]I didn't even play Call of Duty.
[64:19.41]Should we clear debris?
[64:20.53]What's the clear debris supposed to be?
[64:22.68]I think it just opens up more of the map so we can get more of the items.
[64:25.56]But it costs the points.
[64:26.64]We use the points to buy better guns, basically.
[64:28.53]Dude, I swear to God, I've seen the same map in fucking Gmod.
[64:31.77]This is like a conversion or something.
[64:34.27]Really?
[64:34.55]You'll see that a lot.
[64:38.44]Well, this is stupid.
[64:39.24]I don't want to play.
[64:39.80]I'll see you guys later.
[64:43.35]Sorry to see why everyone said no when I asked them to play tonight.
[64:46.79]Oh, dude.
[64:47.05]We were like the last invitees.
[64:50.15]We had, we really... Oh, no.
[64:51.83]We're at the bottom.
[64:52.89]We're at the scraps.
[64:53.79]You guys were the Hail Mary and you both said yes and I was like, yeah.
[64:59.01]Still on.
[65:00.99]Oh, hey.
[65:01.21]James got in.
[65:02.39]Yeah.
[65:02.83]I joined in progress.
[65:03.69]How do I, how did, what's the melee?
[65:06.47]V. I gotta rebind that.
[65:07.45]That's gross, dude.
[65:08.79]So we got insta-kill there, which meant whenever you hit a zombie, they die in one hit.
[65:13.89]That is true.
[65:15.55]Wait, are you teaching me or are you still teaching Jerma?
[65:17.27]I'm just kind of teaching the room.
[65:18.77]You know, you can listen or you don't have to.
[65:21.71]Okay.
[65:22.03]Which weapon is X?
[65:23.49]Who made that?
[65:25.07]It should be Q. Behind you!
[65:29.35]Okay, we're down.
[65:29.99]It's over.
[65:31.09]Are you kidding me?
[65:38.19]Okay.
[65:39.41]That's fine.
[65:40.37]I got my controls anyway.
[65:42.81]I told you, whenever you start the game, it fucking nukes your microphone.
[65:54.98]That's like you opened your mouth and put the Xbox mic in your mouth, closed your lips around it slowly, and then went... That's like the old Xbox 360 mic, too.
[66:05.36]The fucking old quality one.
[66:06.70]That was pretty bad.
[66:09.66]We're going to look for a better one.
[66:12.98]That was probably about two gigs.
[66:14.14]Do you buy stuff in Zombies?
[66:15.60]You do, right?
[66:16.74]Yeah.
[66:17.10]You buy more guns and upgrades to those guns.
[66:20.12]Oh, so it's like Counter-Strike.
[66:21.08]That's what they got it from.
[66:22.56]Yeah, I stole it from Zombies.
[66:23.95]No, no, no.
[66:25.33]I'm saying Counter-Strike.
[66:27.89]Yeah, whatever you want to tell yourself, dude.
[66:30.53]Zombies was the first.
[66:31.55]Candyland.
[66:32.29]Want to play Candyland?
[66:33.33]I don't know if I want to play Candyland.
[66:34.55]Oh, like the board game?
[66:35.89]Yeah, the board game, but it's Zombies.
[66:37.72]Nice.
[66:39.90]There's Turkey Survival.
[66:42.47]That sounds fun.
[66:44.05]Alright.
[66:44.75]Turkey survival?
[66:46.19]So here's the thing.
[66:47.49]There's clearly meme maps, and then there's, like, potentially good maps, and there's, like, somewhere in the middle.
[66:54.36]Don't blow every meme map at once, trust me, because eventually we'll run out of those.
[66:58.92]They're going to get burned out real quick.
[66:59.96]We're going to run out of them.
[67:01.64]And then we're just going to be playing COD Zombies on stream.
[67:04.82]You need to throw out a titty map at some point.
[67:07.64]Look, we may have been promising a lot if we promised titties.
[67:12.00]You know, I'm willing to bet there's titties.
[67:13.92]I'm willing to lie as much as it takes to get people in for a session of Cod Zombies meme stream.
[67:19.55]Alright, I'll tell you guys whatever you want.
[67:21.87]Sonic Zombies.
[67:23.59]McDonald's Custom Zombies.
[67:25.37]McDonald's?
[67:26.03]Why would you make a McDonald's?
[67:26.77]The amount of food brand maps that I found.
[67:30.05]Taco Bell 2.0.
[67:31.37]The amount of food brand maps I was able to find.
[67:33.49]We got KFC in there.
[67:35.41]KFC 3.0.
[67:35.95]Pick all the food ones.
[67:36.91]Do the food ones back to back to back.
[67:38.67]And then take some clips.
[67:40.03]And then we have to decide.
[67:41.19]You guys have to talk about your favorite fast food restaurants after we do it.
[67:45.23]Yeah.
[67:46.57]Is there a Wendy's one?
[67:47.95]I only see Taco Bell, KFC, and McDonald's.
[67:51.03]None of them will respond to you on social.
[67:53.01]Yeah.
[67:53.81]Wendy's will, though.
[67:55.33]Yeah, Wendy's stinks of this shit.
[67:56.39]Does anyone want to try Super Mario Halloween?
[68:00.83]Just fucking pick one, dude.
[68:02.33]Oh, my God.
[68:03.01]Super Mario Halloween.
[68:05.78]This one looks good.
[68:07.06]This one looks high quality compared to the others.
[68:08.52]It's going to be Mario with Dracula teeth.
[68:11.70]Yeah.
[68:11.98]You think there'll be titties in this one?
[68:15.04]I hope there's titties in one of these.
[68:17.18]Looking to get banned today.
[68:18.50]Start without me for one more.
[68:20.20]What the fuck?
[68:21.22]This might be the long haul, Tomato.
[68:23.52]I'm willing to sit out the long haul to make sure this actually fucking... To put it into perspective, my disk drive was so afraid of downloading the maps that it actually lied to me so I wouldn't have to put Call of Duty on my disk.
[68:35.93]So when I went on today, it listed all the maps, but when I went over to my workshop, like, ID thing, like, the actual download page, it just said no space.
[68:44.63]So right now, I'm using all 100 megabytes down at once to blast every mod back onto my game.
[68:52.01]That's too many.
[68:52.57]That is too many megabytes at the same time.
[68:54.22]Damn.
[68:55.12]I've actually never seen Steam provide this many megabytes.
[68:57.68]I think Gabe feels bad for me because he's letting me in.
[69:01.06]What do you have selected here?
[69:03.12]We have Mario Halloween.
[69:06.12]Okay.
[69:06.76]Let's try to beat this one.
[69:08.30]I think we can beat this one.
[69:10.68]I've played Mario a couple times, so I know my way around the... How do you beat zombie levels on this stream?
[69:15.30]We have.
[69:16.14]We beat the Star Wars one.
[69:17.74]How do you beat it?
[69:18.20]We also beat Star Wars.
[69:19.64]You have to pay, like, an absurd amount of money that no one would ever save in COD Zombies, and that lets you leave.
[69:24.61]Yeah, there's usually, like, little objectives.
[69:27.19]Do they give you, like, a cutscene at the end?
[69:29.69]Sometimes.
[69:30.21]Yeah.
[69:30.67]Yeah.
[69:31.19]The Star Wars one we flew away in the Millennium Falcon.
[69:32.83]Press star to play.
[69:34.19]Press star to play.
[69:36.09]Press star to play.
[69:37.07]Oh god.
[69:37.45]Is that going to do that?
[69:38.63]Why does it keep saying it?
[69:39.43]It keeps happening.
[69:40.85]Is it the Goomba?
[69:43.25]I don't know who it is.
[69:43.99]Are the Goombas the zombies?
[69:45.99]Oh, they're behind us.
[69:46.41]Oh, they're just zombies though.
[69:47.47]They're just regular zombies?
[69:50.94]There are some levels that have custom zombies.
[69:54.08]Like full custom.
[69:55.14]This is literally just a fucking plug for this person's YouTube channel.
[69:58.69]I definitely do remember the Halloween Mario one.
[70:01.29]What?
[70:01.91]Bowser T-posing over there.
[70:05.57]There was a good Mario level I picked, and then there was this one that I picked as like the goof.
[70:09.17]God damn it.
[70:10.35]You picked another one.
[70:11.23]I picked the wrong one.
[70:12.64]They're all T-posing in the fucking background.
[70:18.88]Why did we choose to do this again?
[70:20.32]Is that even Bowser?
[70:21.16]No, that's one of the Bowser's kids.
[70:24.99]The one over there, that's Bowser.
[70:26.22]On the left side, the ginormous Bowser.
[70:28.18]You're missing the big guy.
[70:29.40]Yeah.
[70:30.14]Oh, I thought he was talking about like Greco, whatever his name is.
[70:32.30]Greco!
[70:33.66]The famous Bowser.
[70:34.46]It's like Greco, Beco, Deco.
[70:37.00]They all have the same name.
[70:38.10]And then Iggy or something, right?
[70:38.90]I bought a new pathway over here.
[70:39.89]And then Iggy.
[70:42.97]What the fuck?
[70:48.13]Oh, shit.
[70:49.75]Oh, you opened the path?
[70:50.87]Yeah, I opened the path over here.
[70:52.29]Alright, cool.
[70:52.79]What do we got?
[70:54.16]Nothing.
[70:55.57]You think you can hit this block and maybe get something out of it?
[70:58.99]What?
[70:59.23]Like a power-up?
[71:03.54]That was the only audio clip from Mario in this whole map.
[71:14.23]Maybe we can get to, if we get to Bowser, we can get to the castle over there and we can, we can win.
[71:18.91]We can save the princess.
[71:21.25]Somewhere in that collection is a fully modeled Mario 64 castle level.
[71:25.59]And you guys picked Bowser T-pose.
[71:28.07]Alright, how am I supposed to know?
[71:29.49]That's not this at all.
[71:32.37]Ow.
[71:34.01]Yo, is there a bullet drop in a, in a bullet drop?
[71:36.53]Realistic?
[71:39.81]The last time I shot a gun in Call of Duty, I was like 19.
[71:43.38]Here, hit this.
[71:43.82]Hit this.
[71:44.60]Pick this up.
[71:46.22]Hit this?
[71:46.56]So that nukes all of them.
[71:50.59]Well, I'm just telling them, you know?
[71:52.27]This is an early round, man.
[71:53.53]You don't even know these strats.
[71:54.77]Yeah, why'd you pick it up?
[71:55.73]I'm talking Call of Duty 3, by the way, for those of you in the chat.
[72:01.11]19.
[72:01.55]I'll do it.
[72:01.97]Ooh.
[72:03.62]That was good.
[72:04.98]That was an audio.
[72:06.82]Is he posing skeletons?
[72:08.42]Eh.
[72:08.98]What does this do?
[72:09.48]Okay.
[72:09.78]Let's turn on the power first.
[72:11.20]These are not from Mario.
[72:16.37]I hate this dude.
[72:16.89]Should I clear one of these?
[72:18.61]Sure, why not?
[72:19.43]I got news for you, friend.
[72:20.87]I'd spend a lot of money.
[72:21.69]The strangest thing about Call of Duty Zombies mod maps is that almost all of them, even if it's not seasonally, you know, accurate at all, are either Christmas or Halloween related.
[72:32.55]I've seen Christmas levels launch in June on fucking Zombies.
[72:37.53]Shit, you're not.
[72:38.61]Hundreds of them.
[72:39.57]It's like almost every single one.
[72:40.97]So this is going to have a lot of Christmas levels and Halloween levels.
[72:43.29]Is it Garfield?
[72:43.99]No, that's the...
[72:45.23]Oh, dude, did you hear that?
[72:46.36]That was Mario's sound?
[72:47.52]Yeah.
[72:48.88]What the fuck?
[72:52.74]It's about how you can buy weapons?
[72:57.20]I don't like this.
[72:58.18]You're not having fun?
[72:59.87]I don't have enough money.
[73:00.97]What is he saying?
[73:01.69]The horror.
[73:02.13]Oh.
[73:12.32]Yeah, if you don't like this, though, I don't know how you're going to like fucking Monopoly.
[73:15.42]Because that's when it gets real modded.
[73:21.13]Yeah, I'm honestly feeling it.
[73:22.21]Play Monopoly in zombies?
[73:24.05]Like, full on?
[73:25.25]I'll tell you guys one thing about Monopoly zombies.
[73:27.98]Last time me and Craig tried that one, I don't even think we made it past go before we did.
[73:32.46]Yeah, we died before going past go.
[73:34.52]Here we go!
[73:38.20]I'm sure these guys are better, though, you know?
[73:40.14]We've brought together the greatest gaming teams.
[73:43.66]This is like... This is like the Mario noises.
[73:47.92]This is just a meme.
[73:50.59]Somebody just thought this was fun.
[73:52.15]And you know, they spend a lot of time on it.
[73:53.35]You can tell.
[73:54.47]Yeah, come on.
[73:55.25]Come some slack.
[73:56.07]That toad is on fire.
[73:57.11]I turned the power on.
[73:58.85]What did that even do?
[74:00.59]It powered up these juice boxes.
[74:02.97]Wait, I have the best gun in the game?
[74:04.05]I thought I was gonna do something cool with the map.
[74:05.47]Like, what the fuck?
[74:05.87]You have the best gun in the game?
[74:06.93]I have the Wonder Waffle.
[74:08.87]Oh, that is a good gun.
[74:09.85]That is the best gun in the whole game.
[74:10.85]The best gun in the whole game?
[74:12.13]I got it?
[74:12.85]The whole game's best gun.
[74:14.41]Yeah.
[74:14.51]We win, dude.
[74:15.23]Actually?
[74:15.49]Yeah, we're gonna fucking win now.
[74:16.43]Should we save it?
[74:18.35]No, there's no saving it.
[74:19.07]Just don't die.
[74:19.91]What do you mean don't?
[74:21.41]Just don't die.
[74:21.81]What about ammo?
[74:23.43]Well, you gotta get a max ammo for you.
[74:26.73]Is there infinite ammo?
[74:28.81]Where are these five zombies?
[74:29.85]So, I'm not gonna use it then.
[74:30.87]I'm gonna hold onto it until we have the boss.
[74:31.95]They're back here.
[74:36.47]That T-posing Bowser's gonna drop down.
[74:40.15]There are bosses that are modded into some of these mods, by the way.
[74:43.59]There is actual full sequences in this game.
[74:46.32]And Darth Vader knows fucking hype.
[74:48.92]You keep talking about cool instances.
[74:52.04]Hey, I'm not here to pick the maps.
[74:54.32]This is an uncurated Criken version right now.
[74:56.92]I'm still re-downloading the mods.
[74:58.80]I feel like I invited you guys to my party and only three people showed up and then...
[75:02.46]They're all just shitting on the fact that I don't have any decorations.
[75:04.88]They're all gonna leave early.
[75:06.28]You watered down the booze.
[75:08.06]I did, but I wanted them to last longer, dude.
[75:10.37]I know how to show up, so I wanted to make sure.
[75:12.73]Look.
[75:14.33]My plan was originally to fake you guys out and start the map downloading on Minecraft and then swap it last second to Keyland.
[75:20.99]Surprise you guys.
[75:21.93]Then I was gonna, you know, then we were gonna switch to a nice one after that, but the whole scheme has been ruined.
[75:27.13]Well, if you didn't tell us, I would've fell for it.
[75:29.35]Oh, he's doing it now.
[75:31.67]I'm not the host yet, because I'm still... How long does the zombies game actually take to do start to finish?
[75:36.67]Oh.
[75:36.81]Oh, it depends.
[75:37.99]The normal ones don't really have like an end.
[75:40.01]Almost dead.
[75:41.13]Keep going.
[75:42.43]We beat the original Minecraft one from last time we played this in like 15.
[75:47.08]Can I not kill this guy?
[75:47.90]No, it was like 20 to 30.
[75:50.26]And the Star Wars one, I guess it was about an hour and a half.
[75:52.42]Star Wars one was a passion project, though.
[75:54.74]Yeah, that was a trip.
[75:55.82]We'll...
[76:01.31]If we just keep progressing, we can get further to the end.
[76:04.36]And then maybe we can fight Bowser and save Princess Peach.
[76:07.46]All I care about is Bowser.
[76:08.44]That's it.
[76:09.04]I'm going to shoot this into his mouth.
[76:11.48]I don't know what this means.
[76:13.30]Oh, you hear that?
[76:17.06]That means there's dogs.
[76:18.18]Dogs?
[76:19.05]Oh, my God.
[76:21.37]Here they come.
[76:24.05]Okay.
[76:24.87]I can insta-kill these dogs.
[76:26.09]Leave it to me.
[76:27.67]It's actually bad.
[76:29.45]How do I...
[76:30.48]my sensitivity up by like two points and it's watch out watch out watch out watch out watch out alright well alright guys my chat's telling me we gotta wall run this does anyone know how to wall run how the fuck do you do wall run oh get this animal I'm dead no I'm not I'm okay I think if you just hold space it'll do it when you jump but you have to be sprinting
[76:58.29]Hold space?
[76:59.01]Somebody do it.
[77:00.03]I mean, I just completely guessed that.
[77:01.53]I've never played this game.
[77:02.21]I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
[77:27.35]Oh my god!
[77:28.43]How do you fucking jump to the other side?
[77:31.73]I don't know!
[77:35.18]Alright, there's a guy with yellow eyes chasing me and he's hard because he doesn't die in one hit.
[77:40.78]Wait, do they all have yellow eyes?
[77:41.78]Yeah, they all do.
[77:44.74]Oh.
[77:45.38]There's one behind you.
[77:46.28]Alright, I'm gonna try this again.
[77:51.15]Death machine!
[77:53.17]What the fuck do you do?
[77:54.33]Oh no!
[77:56.61]Alright, I can get you.
[77:57.11]How did they get back?
[77:58.78]How did I get you?
[77:59.24]They found it.
[78:00.76]You pick them up, I'll go.
[78:01.88]I'll take care of them.
[78:03.94]Did I use an item on you?
[78:06.27]No, you're good.
[78:07.09]I got max ammo.
[78:08.69]How the fuck?
[78:14.88]Alright, let's try this again.
[78:22.64]Here we go!
[78:25.38]It's almost like you don't stick on the second part.
[78:28.74]You're like, what the fuck?
[78:30.96]I can do it, dude.
[78:31.62]Watch me.
[78:32.50]How did you fucking jump?
[78:33.86]When do you jump off of this?
[78:35.18]Just watch.
[78:36.54]Okay, look forward and hold A or D while jumping wall to wall.
[78:40.44]Really?
[78:40.72]Yes, keep sprinting.
[78:44.07]That's true.
[78:44.69]They got it.
[78:45.03]Hey, you got to hold.
[78:45.93]Oh.
[78:46.49]Oh, okay.
[78:49.57]Well, zombies are here now.
[78:52.76]I'm dead.
[78:57.10]Somebody save me.
[78:57.72]Somebody save me.
[78:58.52]He'll lose the best gun in the whole game.
[79:01.18]I got him.
[79:03.52]Is everyone having a little more fun?
[79:04.80]Yeah?
[79:05.48]Yeah!
[79:06.86]This is big fun, man.
[79:08.22]This is big fun.
[79:08.96]Anyone want another drink?
[79:11.20]What should I do?
[79:11.74]I have $2,700.
[79:12.74]Is that my money?
[79:14.00]Where's my money?
[79:14.55]Spend it on juice.
[79:17.33]Replace the pistol.
[79:18.23]People are screaming at me.
[79:22.29]No, I've never played it before.
[79:25.06]We can get a crawler and then we can just keep fucking trying to do this jump.
[79:28.36]Yeah, that's the high level strategy.
[79:30.08]Yeah.
[79:32.60]Buy the juice.
[79:34.67]Yeah, buy the juice.
[79:35.71]Is this juice?
[79:37.39]You're gonna want to get... Wait, get the juggernaut one.
[79:39.95]Okay, get the juggernaut juice.
[79:41.63]I don't know which one.
[79:42.53]Was that the Juggernaut one?
[79:43.49]What brand did I just drink?
[79:44.43]No.
[79:45.07]It's red.
[79:45.73]Yeah, it's red.
[79:46.93]Off-brand Stamina right there.
[79:48.75]Was that an off-brand Stamina drink?
[79:50.17]Yeah, that was Storm brand.
[79:51.99]Right there.
[79:54.15]Uh-oh.
[79:56.01]I think I found Juggernaut.
[79:56.95]It's back here by Raccoon Mario?
[79:59.53]Replace Pistol.
[80:01.11]Replace Pistol.
[80:02.23]I'm sorry.
[80:04.75]Raccoon Mario?
[80:05.85]Oh.
[80:14.77]Okay, how much is this?
[80:16.29]Here we go!
[80:17.65]It's like $2,500, I think.
[80:19.39]Oh, alright.
[80:20.15]Oh, that's $950.
[80:20.85]Okay, he just got one of the other best guns in the game right there.
[80:25.96]I just watched him on stream get the new best gun.
[80:29.08]What did he get?
[80:32.12]What?
[80:35.24]What did he get?
[80:35.82]I don't know.
[80:36.60]He's got like some dual-wheeled laser beam and shit.
[80:39.84]GKZ45 MK3?
[80:40.46]No!
[80:43.58]I mean, it looks good.
[80:44.76]I am a god.
[80:46.54]How do you keep making this fucking jump?
[80:48.55]Oh, Criken fell.
[80:49.45]Learn to wall run.
[80:51.25]You learn to wall run.
[80:52.29]Oh, I can't see.
[80:52.89]I'm trying, dude.
[80:53.71]I actually fucking... Oh!
[80:57.92]No, no, no.
[80:58.82]I don't like this game.
[81:01.56]I found the same exact spot.
[81:03.52]Whoa, what's that?
[81:04.86]I don't know.
[81:05.20]It's my new weapon that I locked up.
[81:06.90]What?
[81:07.00]You got a black hole gun?
[81:08.08]I got a black hole gun.
[81:09.66]Of course the guy that doesn't know what to do gets it.
[81:11.54]Did you just fall?
[81:13.89]Just now?
[81:14.99]Yeah, I walked right off.
[81:18.03]But I got stamina up so I can run forever.
[81:21.33]No, I was there.
[81:22.69]Really?
[81:22.99]I should do that too.
[81:25.99]Are we losing money for doing this?
[81:27.77]Oh, baby.
[81:29.31]Oh, baby.
[81:31.68]Oh, come on.
[81:32.96]Oh my god, I'm so bad.
[81:38.76]There's only two zombies.
[81:39.96]No!
[81:40.66]What happened?
[81:41.52]Never mind.
[81:43.45]Don't kill the zombies because then the round goes... What am I doing wrong?
[81:48.47]Don't kill the zombies.
[81:51.99]I actually got hurt just now.
[81:53.45]I don't know.
[81:53.73]Don't hurt that one.
[81:54.39]Don't hurt that one.
[81:55.89]No!
[81:56.31]Why?
[81:56.67]What's wrong?
[81:58.77]It's a new round.
[81:59.65]What do you mean it's a new round?
[82:01.88]It's alright because you got a new guy on the team, hey?
[82:05.02]Oh, he's here.
[82:06.56]It's me.
[82:07.12]I'm here.
[82:07.88]Oh.
[82:08.64]Do you know how to wall jump, Tomato?
[82:10.90]Oh, now there's 56 of them.
[82:12.82]I don't even know how to get to you if we're going to be real.
[82:16.39]Where am I?
[82:16.95]Did you not spawn right on us?
[82:18.91]No, I spawned like... I'm pretty close to T-posing Cloud Turtle more than anything.
[82:25.39]Oh, look.
[82:26.79]Oh, yeah.
[82:27.23]Oh, yeah.
[82:27.63]Oh, yeah.
[82:28.07]Oh, yeah.
[82:28.69]Oh, yeah.
[82:29.21]Oh, yeah.
[82:30.15]Fuck.
[82:31.81]Sorry guys, my first ever experience in COD Zombies is Mario Meme Bowser T-Pose Map.
[82:37.62]I don't have time to understand.
[82:39.72]And fucking wall run parkour.
[82:41.62]I keep getting to the end.
[82:43.62]Oh, I finally made it!
[82:44.44]What the fuck!
[82:45.94]I made it to the end!
[82:47.34]Oh, what does that do?
[82:49.91]Nothing, there's Wario.
[82:51.87]Waaaaah!
[82:52.57]Okay.
[82:54.05]That's it.
[82:54.57]Get ready, I'm about to pull this off in one go.
[82:58.08]You guys should hurry up and get over here.
[82:59.42]I don't have any guns.
[83:00.90]Can you guys Luigi me over there?
[83:03.40]What?
[83:03.98]Luigi me?
[83:05.36]Yeah.
[83:06.08]Luigi just does it for you in Mario 3D World.
[83:11.64]Oh.
[83:12.10]Oh.
[83:13.08]Oh.
[83:13.90]I don't.
[83:14.28]I don't know.
[83:15.46]That last one I can't get.
[83:16.46]Oh, my God.
[83:16.88]We're going to die.
[83:20.24]I'm dead.
[83:20.70]No.
[83:22.32]What?
[83:22.62]Keep him off me.
[83:23.29]I'm going to get you out of there.
[83:24.97]Oh, God.
[83:27.77]I'm gonna get you out of there.
[83:30.00]Keep him off of me.
[83:31.06]Keep the one off of me.
[83:32.40]Yeah, we're doing it.
[83:33.28]Uh-oh.
[83:36.82]I don't know what's happening.
[83:39.16]I revived.
[83:39.70]Please don't make me go back to that fucking other area.
[83:42.58]Please don't make me go back.
[83:45.96]We're fine.
[83:47.12]Don't pick me up.
[83:48.38]I was trying to get you two, man.
[83:49.82]Zombies pushed me out of the way.
[83:51.36]I got you.
[83:51.90]Don't worry.
[83:52.28]Jerma's distracted.
[83:53.36]He just ran off.
[83:54.90]No, I'm alright.
[83:56.00]There's nine zombies left.
[84:00.56]But I don't want to get killed.
[84:02.28]No, not me.
[84:02.82]I died.
[84:03.56]What?
[84:04.50]No, wait, you can die?
[84:05.55]Oh, no.
[84:06.93]I didn't know you could die.
[84:08.01]There's only eight zombies left.
[84:10.73]They're getting awfully close.
[84:13.25]I didn't know you could actually perma-die.
[84:15.87]I thought if we all died... Well, eventually he'll come back.
[84:18.92]He'll come back in another round.
[84:22.32]But he won't have his guns anymore.
[84:24.62]I like slow games, like pick Ross...
[84:28.28]Alright, I'm ready.
[84:30.69]I'm ready to switch over and take over the curating duty for this stream.
[84:35.27]Wait, James is almost at Peach.
[84:36.27]Yeah, I'm at Peach, dude.
[84:37.83]I see T-Posing Peach.
[84:39.23]How much do you need for that?
[84:40.29]I need more money.
[84:41.55]How much?
[84:43.25]It's 3,000.
[84:44.19]I have 1,700.
[84:45.82]You can do it.
[84:46.80]Oh, I did it.
[84:47.32]Alright.
[84:47.66]I can get to Peach.
[84:48.66]I actually did it.
[84:49.54]If we get to Peach, then we win.
[84:51.06]How about that?
[84:51.52]We'll just call it that.
[84:52.44]I made it.
[84:54.86]Oh, yeah, James is over here, too.
[84:57.93]We just need the money.
[84:59.25]We don't have enough money to do this.
[85:00.61]How much money is it?
[85:01.91]It's 3,000.
[85:03.05]3,000?
[85:03.25]Mm-hmm.
[85:06.65]I can make us the money, but I need... Someone said to shoot the teddy bears that are hidden.
[85:10.45]Oh, I saw one of those.
[85:12.69]Hidden teddy bears, really?
[85:14.17]I just shot one.
[85:14.89]I just shot one.
[85:16.19]What the fuck does that do?
[85:17.13]Yeah, I just got one.
[85:19.29]We can't pool our money together?
[85:21.80]No.
[85:23.52]No, this isn't a cooperative game.
[85:30.75]Oh, man, that last jump is... I know.
[85:32.39]I keep falling there.
[85:33.17]I don't know the angle.
[85:36.17]This is a boss wave incoming?
[85:37.75]How can you jump?
[85:38.90]This map was just shitty and intriguing enough for you guys to kill just enough time for my entire download to pretty much finish, which was very nice of you.
[85:49.32]Oh, this is so fun.
[85:50.22]So whenever we're sick of this one, we can move on to...
[85:53.71]It's more so whether or not we're gonna be sick of you guys trying this jump.
[85:56.43]Hurry the fuck up and make it.
[85:57.85]Oh my god.
[85:58.81]I'm dead.
[86:01.36]What, you're dead?
[86:02.46]Yeah, Jerma left me to die.
[86:05.22]But he made it.
[86:05.76]Okay, I'm here, you happy?
[86:07.16]Jesus.
[86:08.86]Now we gotta kill the last four zombies.
[86:10.62]Oh, they were way back there.
[86:13.32]No.
[86:15.08]There's gotta be a way for them to follow us.
[86:16.78]Nope, you gotta go back.
[86:19.06]I think they come through this blue door.
[86:22.30]Don't worry, guys.
[86:22.66]Do you really think that Mapmaker had the foresight to build that mechanic into this?
[86:26.34]Maybe, because you can't do anything with this shit.
[86:28.10]If he had the time to make it when I buy a gun, it makes a coin ding sound, then I'm going to guess there's at least a little bit of thought put in.
[86:35.54]Okay, I need to kill four zombies?
[86:38.48]Wait, is that Yoshi looking at Yoshi's own skeleton?
[86:41.89]Yeah.
[86:42.11]Are we ready?
[86:43.45]I'm here.
[86:45.21]Okay, they're coming.
[86:47.35]Alright, now I just need to get to you easy.
[86:49.37]Where are you?
[86:50.74]uh at the stop at spawn okay well here comes another wave alright I'm I'm here with you though wait one of us is gonna get enough money to get the peach dogs left are you gonna be okay it's dogs oh wait you went all the way back oh yeah I came back to kill the zip okay alright I'll I'll get there

[87:41.39]Now this is that Black Ops co-op gameplay I was really seeking out when I conned you all the time.
[87:46.62]The dog just went through that blue portal door thing, whatever the fuck that is.
[87:50.04]I did it.

[88:27.00]And right above it is a YouTube ad for someone's channel.
[88:30.72]And right above that is Mario.
[88:32.80]And above that is Bowser juggling booze, I think.
[88:35.65]What?
[88:35.79]Oh, I thought you said juggling booze.
[88:38.13]I was like, you guys have been talking about booze for like 45 minutes.

[88:58.13]James?
[88:58.69]James is almost there.
[89:00.07]What?
[89:00.35]Oh, you are.
[89:00.81]I'll wait until the pack is a little bit more, uh, you know, lower down, I guess.
[89:05.29]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[89:07.49]Is that the waffle gun?
[89:08.83]Yeah, I kind of can't lose.
[89:11.35]Wait, Criken, you're way down?
[89:12.19]Yeah, you're incredibly powerful.
[89:13.63]Yeah, I'm dead.
[89:14.15]It's alright.
[89:14.59]You guys have fun.
[89:15.27]I'm gonna watch the peach part.
[89:18.92]You're gonna watch the Peach part?
[89:20.40]Yeah, I'm a viewer now.
[89:21.54]It's cool.
[89:23.32]I can come back and get you.
[89:24.24]I don't have anything to lose.
[89:25.18]I mean, now I'm out of time, I think.
[89:27.67]No, they're 4,000.
[89:28.57]Here we go.
[89:28.99]Oh, that's alright.
[89:31.11]We've made the necessary amount of money.
[89:32.77]Okay, I'm watching.
[89:35.23]Oh my god.
[89:35.83]Go get Peach.
[89:38.13]What the fuck is that?
[89:40.05]I have a black hole gun, too.
[89:42.45]Yeah.
[89:43.60]I don't understand how you got every like gun in the game.
[89:47.61]I kind of just, yeah, I typed in the console.
[89:58.57]I am looking forward to what this payoff is going to be.
[90:00.55]If there even will be any payoff.
[90:02.37]Payoff?
[90:03.17]Is there any payoff?
[90:04.11]Will there be payoff?
[90:06.09]No.
[90:06.57]In a mod map of Halloween Mario, you're expecting a payoff.
[90:13.18]No.
[90:13.94]Oh, oh.
[90:15.28]Okay, I'm fine.
[90:16.18]What the fuck?
[90:17.28]What?
[90:19.92]Go get Peach.
[90:22.28]It's time.
[90:22.64]4,000.
[90:23.84]Wait.
[90:24.04]Wait.
[90:27.37]Wait, what?
[90:27.69]It should be 3,000.
[90:28.17]No, yeah, 3,000.
[90:29.41]The other one's 4,000.
[90:30.17]It's 3,000.
[90:30.37]You want me to do it?
[90:31.61]Yeah, you get this one.
[90:32.85]I'll get the next one.
[90:34.67]Peach!
[90:35.48]Oh, the Pack-a-Punch is here.
[90:37.08]What does that do?
[90:37.64]5,000.
[90:38.46]Can you upgrade your weapon?
[90:41.32]Dude, I can upgrade my starter pistol!
[90:43.36]43,000!
[90:43.48]Wait, rescue Peach is only 3,000?
[90:45.84]No, it's 43,000.
[90:46.20]43,000!
[90:46.22]43,000!
[90:46.24]No!
[90:46.34]To fucking rescue Peach!
[90:55.71]That means we have to play for like six hours.
[90:58.07]I don't want to do that.
[91:01.44]That's like six hours of gameplay.
[91:05.28]I just killed everybody in one shot.
[91:07.74]I'm going to pack a punch to the starter pistol, which is a wacky part of the game.
[91:12.94]You get the starting pistol.
[91:15.10]Hey, that scared the shit out of me.
[91:18.03]I don't know why.
[91:19.27]I shoot grenades.
[91:23.37]Hey, you guys want to give up?
[91:25.31]Hey, you know those other like 75 maps?
[91:26.99]Yeah.
[91:27.19]I got like 70 other smooth maps we can choose from as well.
[91:31.55]Yeah.
[91:32.49]You don't want to rescue Peach.
[91:33.81]What?
[91:34.25]No!
[91:36.33]We didn't not rescue Peach.
[91:38.49]You know?
[91:40.42]It's like a to be continued scenario.
[91:44.42]But we're so close.
[91:45.26]You're missing out, man.
[91:46.06]I guess you could always see the ending on that dude's YouTube channel.
[91:49.08]Oh, you're right.
[91:49.74]Dude!
[91:51.40]Shout out.
[91:51.78]You always win.
[91:52.80]You always win.
[91:55.24]That's not a bad YouTube channel name.
[91:57.12]That's a pretty good name.
[91:58.04]That was definitely an early, like, 2000 name.
[92:02.60]I can't remember if I downloaded a bunch of his maps because I thought they all looked like trash garbage or not.
[92:08.17]I definitely, there were definitely a couple people that I went through their entire catalog grabbing maps because I was like, oh, fuck.
[92:13.77]He's, like, bad.
[92:14.63]What's his YouTube channel again?
[92:15.59]Do I make you the... You win, you lose.
[92:16.99]You always win.
[92:18.92]I don't know if you can make me the leader.
[92:20.38]Yeah, I don't know either.
[92:21.32]Do you want to tell me which map to pick?
[92:23.49]Or do you have a... Yeah, I'll back out and tell you which one to pick next.
[92:27.67]Okay, while you back out.
[92:29.45]Because that way I can know which maps are still downloading for me and which ones are done.
[92:33.35]Okay.
[92:34.21]Because there's still a couple that I'm pushing through.
[92:38.31]Let's do...
[92:40.37]Do you guys want to do a real map or do you want to do another shit take?
[92:43.53]Because that's what it boils down to.
[92:46.35]What do you consider to be a real map?
[92:48.45]There are real decent maps.
[92:51.09]Like that Binding of Isaac one is actually a decent map.
[92:53.93]There's stuff like A Christmas Carol, which is a decent map.
[92:56.84]Then there's ones like Pokémon Sun Slash Moon, which I can assure you is a shit map.
[93:02.52]And Taco Bell, which is shit.
[93:05.48]There's Zombies and Cars Mario Kart Edition where you drive cars.
[93:09.50]Ooh.
[93:11.52]So this is going to be a throw-up stream.
[93:13.68]Yeah.
[93:14.38]Drive car?
[93:15.44]I doubt it'll do afterbirth.
[93:17.17]That one sounds legal.
[93:18.79]That one can't fail.
[93:21.21]It's Isaac.
[93:22.11]It's actually got challenges and the proper rooms and you get rewards in the right rooms.
[93:26.75]Oh, okay.
[93:27.69]That one's a legit custom.
[93:29.83]Okay, cool.
[93:30.35]Let's do it.
[93:30.61]Yeah, let's do it.
[93:31.69]Ah!
[93:32.51]Ah!
[93:33.34]Ah!
[93:34.16]Sorry, bless me.
[93:34.86]That sounded like somebody grabbed you in the back of the head and kneed you in the face.
[93:37.97]That was like, ba-bang!
[93:44.49]Thank you, Criken.
[93:46.21]Bless you.
[93:46.87]Did we lose somebody?
[93:55.77]Oh, there we go.
[93:56.89]Oh, he disappeared.
[93:57.59]Yeah.
[94:00.05]I can join mid-game if you guys just start loading.
[94:03.02]I'll join while it's loading.
[94:04.84]Too much data.
[94:05.50]There we go.
[94:05.90]There it goes.
[94:08.94]After this, we'll do Candyland.
[94:11.28]Candyland?
[94:12.00]That one I picked out special.
[94:14.42]Candyland?
[94:15.38]Yeah, Candyland.
[94:16.22]I'd like to do Monopoly again.
[94:19.14]Yeah, I'm curious about Monopoly too.
[94:20.53]Do you actually play Monopoly?
[94:23.34]Do we have to actually place Monopoly?
[94:25.86]Or are you asking in the game?
[94:27.14]Yeah, in the game.
[94:27.96]No, no, no.
[94:29.12]I think you make money by killing the zombies and then you pay to move the dice.
[94:33.76]Oh, yeah.
[94:35.20]It costs zombie points to move your dice.
[94:38.28]That sounds like a mess.
[94:40.22]It is.
[94:40.66]It's a mess.
[94:41.30]It's rough at the very beginning, too, because you have to move.
[94:45.18]What the fuck?
[94:47.42]What?
[94:48.54]Whoa.
[94:49.62]They even have the Isaac font and everything.
[94:52.97]Dude, I told you.
[94:54.09]I picked out some actual mods.
[94:58.01]Oh, man.
[94:58.31]If you go into your graphics, it changes all the font and the menus too and everything.
[95:02.21]Oh, that's cool.
[95:04.61]Nice.
[95:06.05]Knife only.
[95:07.31]Knife only.
[95:07.85]I'm sorry.
[95:08.35]I just...
[95:12.76]Host, kick noob, not knifing first round.
[95:17.16]I'm trying to help you guys out to get further here.
[95:20.06]And I say, fuck you guys.
[95:21.10]You guys are idiots.
[95:21.90]And you boot me.
[95:22.76]Okay, so do I just buy doors?
[95:29.51]My character actually looks like me.
[95:31.51]What the fuck?
[95:32.73]He does.
[95:33.93]What the fuck?
[95:34.92]Does that mind look like me?
[95:39.81]Okay.
[95:41.89]Do we like the music?
[95:43.44]We like the music, right?
[95:44.92]I think I like the music.
[95:46.40]It's alright.
[95:47.50]It's quite ominous.
[95:48.44]I like it.
[95:49.90]Quick revive.
[95:52.16]I'm going to open this door.
[95:53.70]Wait, no, I'm not.
[95:54.50]Whoever has 2,000 is going to open this door.
[95:57.46]Come forward.
[95:58.20]Who's got 2,000?
[95:58.64]That's crikey.
[96:00.08]I will open.
[96:02.94]Whoa, there's a chest.
[96:04.66]Cool.
[96:05.77]It's randomizing.
[96:06.39]What did we get?
[96:10.66]Nothing here.
[96:11.14]There's nothing in that chest.
[96:13.48]It's a lie.
[96:14.50]We need a key, I think.
[96:16.28]I think we actually need to get a key.
[96:20.01]Hey, and now we wipe and die.
[96:22.03]It's happening.
[96:23.85]Is it still knife only?
[96:31.53]Now it's only knife only if we have insta-kill.
[96:34.00]We all take turns opening doors.
[96:35.22]We do have insta-kill.
[96:36.78]So if we have insta-kill, it's knife only.
[96:38.50]If we don't have insta-kill, shoot them.
[96:41.12]Alright, who's opening this one?
[96:42.63]Who's the rich one?
[96:44.21]Wait, it opened up.
[96:45.11]How did it open?
[96:46.61]Oh, how did it open?
[96:47.97]Oh, we got weapon box, that's good.
[96:48.92]Did you guys see that thing?
[96:49.66]What?
[96:49.80]There was some sort of goblin monster in the box.
[96:51.52]Ow!
[96:51.58]Oh no.
[97:08.96]Are we bad?
[97:09.52]Are we bad?
[97:09.98]Are we bad?
[97:10.80]I think we're bad, gang.
[97:15.30]That grenade just saved our lives.
[97:16.78]I can do this.
[97:18.22]Oh, God, I can't.
[97:19.70]Get us.
[97:21.06]I'm trying.
[97:21.60]Do whatever it takes.
[97:23.88]Keep them off of me.
[97:25.48]I have no more.
[97:26.12]Yeah, I can crawl a knife.
[97:29.54]I'm going to die, dude.
[97:30.60]I get in this position when I play VR.
[97:36.69]Alright, alright, alright.
[97:38.76]Nice job, guys.
[97:39.26]Somebody said fucking noobs.
[97:40.78]Keep the crawlers. Keep the crawlers.
[97:47.16]950?
[97:57.16]Alright buy us all guns.
[98:01.33]Keep the craw
[98:03.31]If you lay the blue one, there should be an item in here.
[98:06.17]Oh, it's 500.
[98:07.19]Fucking do that.
[98:07.95]Never mind.
[98:08.69]How much is it?
[98:09.99]I can't buy another gun.
[98:12.00]I'm getting killed by this thing.
[98:13.36]Hey, hey, shoot him.
[98:14.60]Should I shoot him?
[98:16.46]Help.
[98:16.68]Wait, did I kill you?
[98:18.26]Get him off.
[98:19.54]I don't know if I killed you or not.
[98:21.64]No, just get me up.
[98:23.46]Don't let that thing get you.
[98:25.08]Somebody has to come here and help.
[98:27.38]Alright, I'll be over here.
[98:29.32]I'll be like the dog food.
[98:33.00]I'll leave him for two seconds.
[98:35.00]I think I accidentally pinged over here on the wall that says you can draw it, and I don't know what the fuck that even... I'm gonna kill this thing so I get enough money to open this door for us.
[98:42.36]No.
[98:43.76]Don't do... There's more pathways over here.
[98:46.20]Here, I opened it.
[98:48.10]Oh, the power's in here.
[98:49.24]The power's in here.
[98:50.02]This is 2,000.
[98:51.52]Oh, that's 2,000.
[98:52.96]I mean, I feel like we need to, like, open up some of the stuff connecting these rooms together.
[98:56.54]I think that works.
[98:57.00]Like...
[99:01.58]I don't know how the fuck this works.
[99:03.02]How do you draw this?
[99:04.92]Let me see.
[99:05.60]I'm gonna get stuck here.
[99:08.16]I'm holding F. I'm aiming and drawing.
[99:11.74]I need money.
[99:13.82]Nothing's happening.
[99:15.65]Okay.
[99:16.25]Yeah.
[99:16.75]Nice.
[99:18.03]Wow, this is like, oh, this is a good room.
[99:19.61]Guys, come over here.
[99:21.85]Good room?
[99:22.21]This is like good shit.
[99:24.13]We could like actually do a room.
[99:26.31]Ooh.
[99:27.72]It's a slot machine.
[99:30.76]Oh, shit!
[99:31.98]What did you get?
[99:34.14]What is it?
[99:35.10]I don't know.
[99:35.70]An item?
[99:38.16]Out of order.
[99:39.57]You broke it.
[99:40.47]It wasn't a weapon.
[99:41.73]What did you get?
[99:42.85]Watch out behind you.
[99:45.63]The guy's in here.
[99:47.13]I think it was a shield part or something that you build.
[99:50.69]Oh.
[99:51.38]Yeah, there are parts in Black Ops 3 Zombies, like you pick up parts of stuff that you then construct at counters to make, you know, into gear, I guess.
[100:01.57]We could probably kill this now.
[100:02.49]Did you see this gun on the wall?
[100:03.85]Did you figure this thing out?
[100:05.75]We have to find chalk to draw that?
[100:07.51]Keep it off him.
[100:08.05]I need a weapon.
[100:10.99]Uh, prison hold to draw Uzi.
[100:13.41]Yeah.
[100:13.67]I think we need chalk.
[100:14.51]I bet you need chalk and you actually draw it on the wall, but you don't trace it.
[100:17.35]You just need chalk on the ground.
[100:18.79]Oh, right here's the chalk.
[100:20.85]Oh, nice.
[100:21.25]You should run.
[100:22.98]It's a gun version of chalk.
[100:25.62]I think we want to defend in this big room.
[100:27.96]We're going to start getting ripped up.
[100:30.02]Why didn't it do it?
[100:30.94]Did you drop a coin?
[100:31.54]I just picked up chalk.
[100:33.88]Is there a tinted rock?
[100:34.40]Are people saying tinted rocks, maybe?
[100:37.78]Yeah, there are rocks.
[100:38.68]Maybe we have to grenade them.
[100:40.46]It was a blue rock, and you still had to buy it.
[100:43.38]Oh, you have to buy it.
[100:44.46]Yeah.
[100:44.70]What the fuck?
[100:47.48]Double points.
[100:50.21]Oh, this is fun.
[100:50.81]I picked up the chalk, but it doesn't let me take out the gun.
[100:53.74]I have it in my inventory.
[100:57.72]What the fuck?
[101:02.08]It shows that I have chalk.
[101:04.34]Let me draw this Uzi.
[101:05.58]Alright, now we knife.
[101:07.74]Oh, that's the 5-7 chalk.
[101:09.76]Now we need chalk specific for the gun.
[101:12.22]I am going to open this door.
[101:14.63]Wait, what number?
[101:15.63]The number on the bottom left is six.
[101:17.13]Now the power is on.
[101:19.27]The gun called the five shift.
[101:20.37]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[101:21.07]What is happening?
[101:21.97]I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up.
[101:23.61]He's in that room locked in.
[101:25.42]He went into like a boss room.
[101:27.06]Why are you in a boss room?
[101:28.06]I didn't realize this could happen.
[101:29.20]What the fuck was that?
[101:30.82]He was doing the boss fight without it.
[101:33.34]Where are my friends?
[101:35.06]Out here.
[101:37.28]Watch out.
[101:39.68]Run.
[101:40.14]I'm in a bad spot.
[101:43.05]Describe it.
[101:44.50]They're all here.
[101:46.44]All the zombies are here.
[101:47.42]Oh, shit.
[101:49.86]Hey!
[101:52.83]How do I use those axes?
[101:54.95]I got a DSLR.
[101:55.65]Let it be known, Criken, that I did stay at the other side of the door in your final moments.
[102:01.31]Oh, thank you.
[102:02.93]Throw it.
[102:03.45]I don't know how to... Oh, my God!
[102:06.20]Yeah, you can save me.
[102:10.06]I'm gonna come get you.
[102:17.09]Ooh, the music's gotten started now.
[102:19.01]It started like the OG Isaac.
[102:21.23]Yeah, I'm one of them.
[102:24.79]Don't let me die.
[102:25.86]I think he's gonna die.
[102:27.10]Hey, hey, hey!
[102:27.98]Oh, look at that nose scope, Jerma.
[102:30.54]I saw that.
[102:31.06]I'm dead.
[102:31.48]Not cute.
[102:34.18]Jeez, normal grenades.
[102:35.46]How the fuck do you throw secondary grenades?
[102:38.14]We're gonna get you out of this one, Jerma, but you gotta give me a hot sec.
[102:42.95]I mean, actually, now I'm looking at it more, I don't think we're gonna get you out of this one.
[102:47.38]We should be okay.
[102:48.18]We should be okay.
[102:48.84]I mean, we'll be okay, but I don't know if I can get to him.
[102:51.77]How many more are there?
[102:52.79]Oh, we don't even know.
[102:54.01]There's a lot left.
[102:55.31]Oh, look out behind me!
[102:56.13]Behind me!
[102:57.43]Come on in here!
[102:58.37]Just get in here!
[102:59.63]Come on.
[103:02.09]I'm gonna die.
[103:04.29]I'm running low on ammo, James.
[103:05.93]I'm dead.
[103:08.30]I'm okay.
[103:11.18]I got some.
[103:12.32]Luke, let's go!
[103:14.06]Oh, you got rid of the crawler.
[103:15.40]Don't!
[103:16.92]No!
[103:17.84]Wait, I'm alive.
[103:18.66]You did it.
[103:18.99]Hey, we did it.
[103:20.19]Yay.
[103:22.45]I don't have any guns, though.
[103:23.87]Yeah, we need to get them quick.
[103:25.19]Yeah.
[103:27.85]Oh, that gun's good, man.
[103:29.17]That shotgun.
[103:29.99]Oh, what's that one?
[103:31.84]What's the teddy bear?
[103:34.32]I'm sorry.
[103:35.56]Teddy bear means it goes to another location.
[103:37.10]It means you don't get to use that box.
[103:39.98]Oh, the box moves?
[103:41.68]Oh, no.
[103:42.28]Oh, there's a sail, too.
[103:43.75]No.
[103:44.81]Fire sail.
[103:46.39]We cannot survive in this room.
[103:48.69]We gotta go.
[103:49.43]This one looks okay.
[103:51.39]This gun is so bad.
[103:53.95]Blue rock.
[103:56.96]We gotta pay that thing 500 bucks or it's not gonna go anywhere.
[104:02.34]I'm going to you guys.
[104:03.02]I can open this fancy room.
[104:04.34]Oh, in here.
[104:05.14]In here, gang.
[104:06.22]In here.
[104:08.18]Wait, it came back.
[104:08.93]It came back.
[104:09.35]Oh, thank God.
[104:10.49]No, the box is here, too.
[104:12.75]Use this one.
[104:13.15]I'll cover you.
[104:13.75]Use this one.
[104:14.05]Hold for part.
[104:14.71]What is that?
[104:15.39]What about that thing?
[104:17.47]What about that thing?
[104:18.11]What?
[104:18.43]What?
[104:18.71]What did you do to the box?
[104:21.47]Where did the box go?
[104:22.63]I didn't touch it.
[104:24.38]I didn't touch anything.
[104:25.44]He took the box.
[104:26.82]I didn't press any buttons at all.
[104:29.08]What's happening, gang?
[104:31.58]I wanted to use that thing over there.
[104:33.86]Yay!
[104:36.02]I got a slot machine part.
[104:38.37]The teddy bear is over here.
[104:41.01]Whenever I walk up to something to use it, someone has just been there, and when I try to use it, it's broken.
[104:45.41]This slot machine is on fire now.
[104:48.21]I'm out of ammo.
[104:48.71]Can I make a crawler?
[104:53.14]The second I tried to use it, it broke.
[104:57.46]The fire still puts them everywhere, someone's telling me, so...
[105:00.47]There we go.
[105:01.61]You guys okay?
[105:02.25]Yeah, but the teddy bear's over here.
[105:03.75]I made a crawler.
[105:04.43]You're good.
[105:04.91]You can explore.
[105:07.03]Hold F for part.
[105:07.92]Does anyone know what the teddy bear does?
[105:09.88]Hang on.
[105:10.14]Let me take a look.
[105:11.28]If there's a part on the ground and you're in, you're seeing that.
[105:13.70]See this?
[105:14.72]See that foot?
[105:16.84]Yeah, that's the part.
[105:19.76]When we get a couple of those, you can put them together on a bench and you can make a fancy weapon.
[105:25.49]It's not for...
[105:27.67]Hi, Smacksable.
[105:28.87]Thank you.
[105:29.45]Fox!
[105:31.05]Dibs!
[105:32.11]No!
[105:33.25]No, me Dibs, please!
[105:34.73]Oh my god, it changed everything.
[105:35.67]Me Dibs, me Dibs, me Dibs.
[105:36.55]Oh, you have grenades.
[105:38.11]Yes!
[105:39.13]Oh.
[105:39.27]Pistol.
[105:39.53]Yeah, nice, classic pistol.
[105:41.59]Step aside, will ya?
[105:43.55]Press F. I want... to go again.
[105:48.27]Sorry.
[105:50.13]What do you got?
[105:51.55]E. Not bad.
[105:54.47]What's in the mystery box?
[105:56.01]Hope I get, like, the Half-Life hand.
[105:58.66]Where the fuck are you guys?
[105:59.80]I'm babysitting this fucking crawler over here.
[106:02.95]I mean, do you really have to babysit it, or can you, like, sort of leave it?
[106:06.17]It'll die on its own if you leave it.
[106:07.81]Oh, will it?
[106:08.27]Well, I'll trade off with you.
[106:09.21]You go ahead.
[106:09.65]I have no money.
[106:11.09]Alright, what are you guys doing over here?
[106:12.78]Tag.
[106:12.94]Tag me.
[106:14.62]Tag, you're in.
[106:16.36]Uh, how do I get in there?
[106:18.48]Can I open this door for $7.50?
[106:19.76]Uh, skip that one, because I'm on the... Because I'm on the other side.
[106:25.43]Uh...
[106:27.32]Yeah, that takes us back to spawn.
[106:30.18]Do you guys need somebody with more money to fucking open some more shit?
[106:35.08]Yeah.
[106:35.36]I'll let this thing die.
[106:36.64]This one?
[106:37.74]What should I open?
[106:39.52]Let's just go.
[106:40.18]I don't know if there's like multiple furs or what.
[106:43.34]But there's a key door over by me.
[106:45.62]I don't know if you can open it.
[106:47.67]Wait, what happened to the zombie?
[106:49.09]Okay.
[106:49.63]How much is the key door?
[106:51.25]I don't know, but it's over here by me.
[106:53.17]I'll walk over to it.
[106:54.03]I gotta make sure this zombie doesn't get too far away.
[106:55.45]Yeah, there's a key door here.
[106:56.33]He's stuck on a rock.
[106:57.35]I'm so fucking excited for that.
[106:59.21]This one's 2,000.
[107:01.27]I'm holding in P for that one.
[107:04.11]Stop looking at him.
[107:05.17]There's another 2,000 door over here as well.
[107:07.13]I guess just don't be careful.
[107:11.67]One of the 2,000 doors that's blue leads into the same room we've already opened.
[107:15.55]That might have been the other one.
[107:17.77]So make sure you don't get that one.
[107:21.44]Oh, nice.
[107:23.18]It looks like it makes a random... But we need the chalk for all of these guns.
[107:27.31]Seriously?
[107:29.13]Yeah.
[107:29.67]You need to find the chalk that goes with... Wait, no.
[107:33.03]Press and hold F to pick up AN-94 chalk.
[107:36.07]Oh, this looks like you get the chalk here and then you bring it to the room.
[107:39.47]Oh, shit.
[107:39.93]Okay.
[107:41.37]So, I'll tell you guys which one this was over here.
[107:43.97]We need Uzi chalk.
[107:46.20]I got it.
[107:47.18]Yeah, get the Uzi chalk.
[107:47.78]Put that on the wall there.
[107:51.34]I'll just be here babysitting the zombie.
[107:55.95]That's 1500.
[107:56.35]You still have to pay for it after that?
[107:59.53]What the fuck?
[108:00.51]And you gotta pay.
[108:01.15]You gotta find it and pay.
[108:03.79]What's the perk that we got back here?
[108:06.18]Mule Kick.
[108:08.12]God.
[108:09.16]I like that everyone's getting excited for this map because the next one's gonna be trash.
[108:14.36]Trash.
[108:16.41]Garbage.
[108:17.37]I wanna play Mario Kart now.
[108:18.13]What's in here?
[108:19.73]I picked a lot of Mario maps because they're almost as plentiful as Halloween and Christmas maps.
[108:26.43]Why am I getting vote kicked in my own chat?
[108:31.29]What?
[108:33.83]Have we gotten most of the doors?
[108:36.50]What's this music?
[108:37.22]Yeah, do you hear it?
[108:38.44]Get closer to the button.
[108:44.03]I don't remember this being in Binding of Isaac.
[108:47.45]I don't think that's a part of Binding of Isaac at all.
[108:51.31]Hey, can I kill this stupid zombie now?
[108:53.97]Yeah.
[108:55.20]Yeah.
[108:55.34]We don't have anything else.
[108:59.54]Oh, it's this thing.
[109:01.34]Mule Kick is three guns instead of two.
[109:03.04]Oh, okay.
[109:04.52]Ph.D.
[109:05.06]Flopper.
[109:05.42]Does anyone know what that is?
[109:06.52]That's the one where you need to do the dolphin dive.
[109:08.99]Yeah.
[109:09.39]It's really strong.
[109:11.42]Okay, I'm going to hang out in this big square room.
[109:15.40]If y'all want to join me.
[109:20.92]We haven't found Juggernaug, have we?
[109:23.49]No.
[109:26.85]What about Stamina?
[109:27.57]I found that one.
[109:29.98]This one makes a cool noise.
[109:32.50]I feel like the Stamming Up one was in that first one with the blue rock where the slots was.
[109:39.11]With the Uzi.
[109:40.55]This map would be good for that.
[109:43.11]Guys, I... I got stuck.
[109:51.76]I'm still learning.
[109:55.26]I can get you.
[109:55.82]I can get you.
[109:56.46]I can get you.
[110:00.56]I don't even know why I switched guns.
[110:02.90]You're good.
[110:03.88]Now scroll.
[110:05.12]I thought I had the shotgun.
[110:06.10]I do.
[110:07.12]Ow!
[110:13.47]S-V-U-A-S.
[110:15.35]Chalk.
[110:16.17]Just buy my fucking custom random... Ray gun!
[110:18.83]Oh, come on, man!
[110:20.05]Whatever.
[110:20.25]That means that my odds have never been better than the beginning.
[110:25.52]What was that?
[110:26.52]Why is there a nuke right there?
[110:28.36]That's like a fucking pentagram.
[110:30.79]Hey, I'm standing on a pentagram.
[110:32.39]It's rotating around.
[110:33.43]Yeah, that's going to be good.
[110:34.89]Is that you doing that?
[110:35.69]Did I get off?
[110:37.05]Maybe.
[110:38.07]I'm afraid to get off.
[110:38.97]Oh, fuck!
[110:39.43]What is that?
[110:40.05]I don't know.
[110:40.85]Oh, why?
[110:42.03]Oh!
[110:42.92]Oh!
[110:44.10]Oh!
[110:44.72]What the fuck is that?
[110:47.98]Yo, there's some sort of ghost chasing after me right now.
[110:52.40]What the fuck are those?
[110:53.97]Oh, okay, we're on the same page.
[110:56.47]Oh, they spawn out of there.
[110:58.57]Alright, that makes sense.
[111:03.31]What is up with all the numbers?
[111:04.41]Is that the fucking coordinates that they're spawning?
[111:07.01]Break these down.
[111:08.53]What are the numbers, man?
[111:09.59]As they come out.
[111:11.73]Oh, shit.
[111:12.35]It's just a Mega Man password.
[111:13.67]Oh, my God, what the fuck is that?
[111:15.89]What?
[111:16.31]Crank it?
[111:18.03]Whoa.
[111:19.77]Oh, there's like a super one here.
[111:22.69]Oh, no.
[111:23.38]I got you.
[111:25.02]Oh, no!
[111:25.54]I have no ammo!
[111:26.52]No!
[111:27.08]Oh!
[111:27.56]Oh!
[111:27.74]Oh!
[111:28.10]Oh!
[111:28.46]I'm panicking!
[111:30.82]Okay.
[111:31.32]He's up.
[111:32.34]Shit.
[111:32.94]We did it.
[111:33.24]I'm gonna get you out of here.
[111:35.43]Thank you.
[111:36.41]You're welcome.
[111:37.23]We did it.
[111:38.53]You know I always got your back, James.
[111:40.83]I forgot about my secondary weapon.
[111:44.99]You guys hear how to open these yet?
[111:46.24]More weapons.
[111:48.04]Try hitting it.
[111:49.53]Double tap root beer.
[111:51.73]Cool.
[111:52.07]Hey, can I play on the slot machine?
[111:57.40]Yeah.
[111:59.16]We only need one more piece, I think.
[112:03.22]I'm dead.
[112:05.32]Oh, I won.
[112:08.54]Where's the gun thing?
[112:09.60]Crawl over here.
[112:12.43]How do I unprone?
[112:14.15]How do I get up?
[112:15.19]The same way you proned.
[112:16.81]I don't.
[112:21.37]Alright, what does double tap even mean?
[112:24.99]It just means you shoot twice as fast.
[112:29.23]Yeah, fast.
[112:30.21]Hold still.
[112:31.97]God damn it.
[112:32.97]Hang on.
[112:33.39]I'll get him.
[112:34.35]No, you get him all for you.
[112:35.73]No, they spawned behind me.
[112:37.65]No.
[112:38.78]They're coming.
[112:39.16]I don't know if we can make it to you, man.
[112:42.56]You're like... We can do it.
[112:44.66]We can do it.
[112:45.04]Let's go.
[112:45.36]I'm pretty far.
[112:46.50]He's like a mile away.
[112:47.72]This grenade...
[112:54.26]Four grenades into the chasm next to them.
[112:56.44]I'm going for him.
[112:58.78]I'm going for him.
[113:00.84]Alright.
[113:02.48]We're with you.
[113:08.08]Did they all go down into the chasm?
[113:10.63]I need a new gun.
[113:11.47]I got insta-kill.
[113:17.61]Fuck.
[113:18.55]Where's the guns?
[113:19.29]Alright, let's try to keep a couple of these alive now.
[113:21.83]I think we're reaching the end.
[113:23.35]We can spend some time.
[113:24.79]We got some cool exploration.
[113:27.21]PhD flopper.
[113:27.91]I don't know what that is, but I got it.
[113:31.52]I don't know how to PhD flop in Black Ops 3.
[113:33.62]That was something in Black Ops 1.
[113:36.70]Is it like control?
[113:37.56]No, not control.
[113:38.54]I just don't kill any of the zombies that are still alive.
[113:42.16]I think I want a different gun.
[113:46.43]There's always the random box.
[113:47.85]You can slide with C. I don't know what that is.
[113:50.75]Oh, shit.
[113:51.25]Wow, you can.
[113:56.07]Where's the box at?
[113:56.93]I got a fucking teddy.
[113:58.43]Oh, it's right here.
[113:59.83]Now, it looks like it changes spots, actually.
[114:05.19]I'm going to open this.
[114:06.01]I don't even know if this goes to anything, honestly.
[114:11.63]Oh, that's like the last zombie.
[114:12.71]Wait, what's this?
[114:14.35]What's this death pile?
[114:15.51]Oh, watch out to the Earth.
[114:16.37]Right, right, right.
[114:17.01]There's a zombie.
[114:18.79]Requires gold level initialization.
[114:22.33]Deadshot Daiquiri.
[114:24.58]Oh, I don't know if you have that.
[114:27.00]Gold tier initialization.
[114:29.00]I want to open this.
[114:29.62]Oh, Chuggernaug was in here.
[114:31.22]This zombie is just hanging out in front of the box.
[114:34.70]Okay, I'm going to kite him over here.
[114:37.76]Oh, boy.
[114:40.21]Oh, yeah.
[114:40.79]Oh, I see.
[114:41.28]Because that's like the equivalent of that spike room.
[114:45.76]I get it.
[114:46.16]I want to replace the shotgun with the M-TAR.
[114:51.76]The fuck is all this?
[114:53.70]Step aside.
[114:56.08]How do I do the flop thing?
[114:57.24]Okay, I just got another M-TAR.
[115:00.46]What the fuck?
[115:01.29]These are like mass produced.
[115:03.27]These things are bad?
[115:04.19]That's what I just got.
[115:05.05]I just got one.
[115:06.63]Oh, oh, good.
[115:07.93]Oh.
[115:08.79]Oh, there goes the... Oh, God.
[115:11.03]It gave me a second M-tar and then flew away.
[115:15.72]Was this the door that you guys said you already unlocked on the other side?
[115:18.16]This blue door here?
[115:20.98]That's in this blue room?
[115:22.72]No.
[115:23.32]Hang on.
[115:23.74]Stay there.
[115:24.36]Stay there.
[115:24.76]That's a 2,000.
[115:25.40]Connect me.
[115:26.88]Check.
[115:27.14]I'm going to go to where... As close as I can get to that side and see if it's actually like a space or not.
[115:33.07]Should we kill this guy?
[115:34.66]No.
[115:35.84]Okay, I got a tinted rock over here.
[115:38.86]James, there's no way we've been there before.
[115:41.13]Well, somebody has enough points to open it.
[115:43.29]I've spent so many points on other things.
[115:45.29]Okay, I'll open it.
[115:46.77]I'll take the hit.
[115:49.67]If any of you guys know what a vulture aid is, it's $3,000 and it's right over here.
[115:54.58]I would have spent all my $2,000 plus another $1,000 to get that.
[115:58.76]What's full trade?
[116:00.10]The fuck?
[116:01.40]Oh, this is like a super gold key room for another 2K.
[116:05.76]And then over here we have... I'll let you see everything.
[116:12.72]I want to go in the super gold key room.
[116:16.88]What's that?
[116:17.44]What's that?
[116:17.98]You see that bottle?
[116:19.26]It's a bottle.
[116:22.32]Shoot it.
[116:25.58]I think it's a part, isn't it?
[116:28.14]So what's the story?
[116:29.14]Are we doing 11?
[116:30.89]How many rounds?
[116:31.53]You can get through these blues.
[116:33.15]Wait, do you see this right here?
[116:34.55]Wait, wait.
[116:36.91]They spawn random BioShock fenders.
[116:40.45]Oh, it's a secret.
[116:43.23]Oh, it is a wall.
[116:44.55]It's probably a secret wall.
[116:46.40]We need a grenade.
[116:47.64]Step back.
[116:48.56]Oh.
[116:51.70]Oh, fuck.
[116:52.54]It rolled off.
[116:53.32]Okay, that went in the chasm.
[116:54.88]Hang on, let me try again.
[116:57.76]Oh, mine didn't.
[116:59.26]Ah, my juggernaut, dude!
[117:01.48]Shit!
[117:02.50]This rocks!
[117:05.64]We're gonna wipe and die.
[117:06.90]I figured out what my flop thing did.
[117:09.48]Oh my god, you all died!
[117:10.70]What the fuck?
[117:12.40]They dropped grenades and killed themselves, and then I locked myself in.
[117:15.56]Everyone threw grenades at this thing, and I was on it when they threw them, including my own grenade.
[117:21.16]I can't jump over this.
[117:23.35]Why?
[117:23.73]I
[117:25.95]oh my god hey I mean uh I do this monkey bomb well you know that was good that was a good second time I don't know if it's random every game or not I'm gonna assume no it fell in the hole uh my monkey bomb fell in the hole didn't work hey well uh Black Ops 3 is pretty fun game it's first time I've ever opened it
[117:51.36]Yeah, worth the 60 bucks in three years.
[117:53.54]Well, I hope you liked the one good map we played, man, because next is Candyland.
[117:59.15]It was still 60 bucks.
[118:01.39]Yeah.
[118:02.05]You think it's ever going to drop price?
[118:03.63]No.
[118:03.83]I thought maybe.
[118:05.27]Wait, Five Nights at Freddy's zombies?
[118:07.13]Dude, I totally grabbed that.
[118:08.64]Pog dude, who wants to play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[118:11.46]Pog dude, who wants to play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[118:15.40]Let me see if that one's ready for me yet.
[118:23.12]I got Candyland ready for sure.
[118:25.35]Okay, let's do Candyland.
[118:26.93]And then Five Nights at Freddy's.
[118:28.27]Yeah, that'll be ready after that.
[118:29.41]I think after that level, I'll be caught up and good to go.
[118:35.76]I mean, hey, you gotta give this game credit.
[118:37.94]They made this game really moddable.
[118:43.02]I'm surprised you can put this much stuff in here.
[118:45.62]Yeah.
[118:47.55]It's, I mean, I think that's, I think it's really impressive.
[118:50.25]It's a shame that they'll probably never let people mod a game this much again for Call of Duty.
[118:54.69]Alright, I need more alcohol for this.
[118:55.99]I'm going to get it.
[118:56.61]Be back.
[118:57.49]Same, man.
[118:58.59]Oh, everybody's drinking.
[118:59.59]I'm not drinking.
[119:00.05]I keep my drink right here.
[119:01.79]Oh, Tomato, you're not in the lobby.
[119:04.15]Huh?
[119:04.41]Oh, yeah, I was going to join when it was loading because I was making sure it was still, I was ready to play it.
[119:10.11]Just press start.
[119:10.73]I'll join while it's loading.
[119:13.21]Candyland KJ.
[119:16.29]We gotta play this seriously, though.
[119:17.59]I'm not gonna let you guys ruin the only reason I did this session.
[119:20.43]Okay?
[119:21.62]Thanks.
[119:22.16]For this map?
[119:23.38]Yeah, seriously.
[119:24.04]Take the board game ones, like, seriously, or else I'm gonna be mad.
[119:27.24]There's a dabbing zombie from fucking... Zombie is not joinable!
[119:30.98]Oh my god, he locked me out.
[119:33.03]Hey, take this seriously.
[119:34.03]A dabbing zombie on the initial screen.
[119:37.28]They also look like they cut out, like, they're fucking, oh my god, dude.
[119:43.03]There's an evil cookie monster here blocking our path.
[119:46.07]Wait, that's Candy from fucking Donkey Kong.
[119:48.85]There's already a zombie here.
[119:49.89]Hey, Criken, can you invite me again?
[119:51.37]It's not actually letting me in this time.
[119:52.41]Okay.
[119:53.69]Do I have a challenge for you?
[119:55.06]What the fuck is this?
[119:59.08]They're crawling over.
[120:00.02]The Candy zombies are here already.
[120:02.30]Whoa!
[120:05.68]Oh, you pistol whip him.
[120:06.74]You don't have a knife.
[120:08.28]You pistol whip him.
[120:13.22]What was that?
[120:13.92]It's right here.
[120:16.11]You can get this for free.
[120:19.05]Oh, wow.
[120:19.43]Wait.
[120:19.93]Axe?
[120:22.59]Oh, I don't think it's going to let me in.
[120:24.75]Really?
[120:25.03]Should we have to go back?
[120:25.79]It says I'm in the lobby.
[120:26.89]Maybe it's still loading.
[120:27.70]You guys are ruining Candyland.
[120:38.74]Yeah, totally bugged.
[120:39.52]I can't get it.
[120:40.68]Okay.
[120:43.54]Whoa.
[120:45.28]That's loud.
[120:48.72]I want to beat this level.
[120:49.82]Are you guys gone or what?
[120:53.33]We can do it.
[120:53.93]There's a lot of Cookie Monsters.
[120:56.43]Six kills.
[120:56.87]Please?
[120:57.85]Please.
[121:04.43]Did anyone play Candy Land a lot when they were a kid?
[121:07.30]Oh, my game just crashed.
[121:09.22]Yeah, there goes the game.
[121:10.36]So that means we can't lose this level or it will crash.
[121:13.86]Ah, yes.
[121:14.52]I see you found the dark level.
[121:17.80]The one of every session.
[121:21.16]I didn't actually know it was this one, to be fair.
[121:23.84]I knew eventually we'd find one.
[121:26.54]So everyone's voice is going to be loud.
[121:28.30]We should probably mute and fix it, right?
[121:32.79]We just, you know, play a little bit of a danger game.
[121:36.57]Yeah, I like living on the edge.
[121:37.83]It just happened for me.
[121:39.46]I like living on the edge, man.
[121:48.64]I like to feel alive.
[121:50.78]Oh, my God.
[121:54.12]Alright, come on in.
[121:57.35]Yeah, Corey, you can continue to host, though, since I'm still technically downloading stuff.
[122:00.53]Okay.
[122:01.71]Oh, there it goes.
[122:02.11]It went back down.
[122:06.31]Let's see if my mic explodes.
[122:10.47]Why am I getting the beginning message for Black Ops?
[122:14.76]Welcome to Black Ops.
[122:17.86]Who said that?
[122:18.40]Let's talk again.
[122:20.54]Welcome to Black Ops.
[122:21.70]You're so quiet.
[122:23.02]You turned your whole microphone down to muted.
[122:25.34]Is my mic all fucked up?
[122:30.25]How's my mic?
[122:30.85]I'm going to be very quiet for you guys.
[122:32.39]You're alright.
[122:33.19]Yeah, you're alright.
[122:35.17]Yeah, Criken's went really low.
[122:39.93]Also, your party is private.
[122:41.29]Oh, wait.

[126:17.22]Front door.
[126:19.76]Under the rainbow.
[126:21.64]These guns don't have any recoil, these pistols.
[126:24.58]It's actually kind of weird.
[126:25.95]Yeah, it's like awkward.
[126:28.43]They don't have any bounce.
[126:35.40]Alright, I got money.

[129:04.72]Alright, I'll get it.
[129:05.68]Wait, never mind.
[129:07.16]I don't think you could have afforded it.
[129:08.64]No.
[129:08.92]Oh, it can't reach you yet.
[129:10.46]God damn it.
[129:11.70]It's on the other side.
[129:12.74]Dude, we're about to leave the candy land.
[129:14.59]I'll try to get the next one.
[129:16.33]Wait, we're almost about to beat it?
[129:17.39]Oh, there's a GameCube over here.
[129:18.61]That's fun.
[129:19.13]That's a candy theme.
[129:21.35]I don't think these zombies can cut across the invisible walls, so they have to go down the hallway.
[129:25.74]They can spawn on us, though.
[129:27.58]They can spawn.
[129:28.82]They're cutting across, these guys.
[129:30.16]No, those ones are fresh spawns.
[129:33.94]Oh, no, these ones jump over the back.
[129:39.01]So they can't spawn in front of us, but... Oh, what is this terrible PNG of blood?
[129:43.13]Behind us.
[129:44.63]Yeah, it comes your whole screen.
[129:45.47]Has it ever been hit twice?
[129:46.27]Because your screen becomes a terrible blood PNG.
[129:49.23]Actually, when I went down, it was, like, all blood.
[129:51.28]It was, like, a solid JPEG.
[129:52.74]I'll get this one.
[129:53.84]Speaking of bad PNGs, look at the seven in the bottom left.
[129:59.82]Oh.
[130:00.20]Oh, I can see the outline of white.
[130:01.90]You can see the white outline.
[130:04.04]Oh.
[130:05.66]Are we just spawning whole rounds here over and over again?
[130:09.18]Every time we open up a Cookie Monster, is it spawning stuff?
[130:12.16]No, no, no.
[130:14.06]We're just getting further in.
[130:15.32]I'll get the next one.
[130:17.78]Yes, please.
[130:18.54]My money.
[130:26.90]Watch out, Criken.
[130:28.60]I got your back.
[130:30.30]Looks like some of them just get stuck in the bottom.
[130:32.27]What the
[130:33.55]Hey, it works for me.
[130:34.11]I'm about to win Candyland.
[130:34.67]Oh, wait.
[130:34.89]We're feeding this thing.
[130:36.05]We're feeding their souls to this thing.
[130:39.27]Where?
[130:39.73]Which thing?
[130:40.71]This big battery-looking thing.
[130:43.61]See?
[130:43.81]Oh!
[130:44.35]Yeah, let the zombies get to this.
[130:45.89]Oh, let them get to this.
[130:46.77]Is that one power or the perks?
[130:48.63]Yeah, these weird, like, pylons.
[130:51.52]I got this, man.
[130:53.00]Damn right you got this.
[130:54.14]Corky.
[130:58.73]It's just, oh, they're going to be so expensive by the end.
[131:01.69]Is that Roblox?
[131:02.63]What kind of chicken?
[131:04.01]Something Roblox up ahead.
[131:06.87]I don't know.
[131:07.73]A chicken wrap?
[131:08.83]A wrap, maybe?
[131:14.52]Beef chicken?
[131:15.84]We have to keep going.
[131:18.42]Dude, I need money.
[131:19.54]How do we get the one up here?
[131:22.68]Juggernaug is here.
[131:23.96]Juggernaug.
[131:25.52]Juggerpawg.
[131:27.44]Whatever you get will be delicious.
[131:29.40]Behind us, to the left.
[131:31.14]They're coming for the ice cream cones.
[131:57.78]Okay, there's a, watch out.
[131:59.42]Did I just kill us?
[132:00.74]Insta kill, insta kill.
[132:02.06]Oh, okay, I thought I just accidentally killed everybody.
[132:03.56]And double points.
[132:06.44]Everyone knife.
[132:08.30]Oh, damn it.
[132:09.82]What is this?
[132:11.18]Well, there goes that.
[132:14.85]I've got like no ammo for another one.
[132:16.57]You want that.
[132:17.27]That's like, that's the one you really want.
[132:19.77]There's a C4 over there.
[132:23.65]Yo, dude, I'm not ready to fight these rabbits.
[132:25.69]This whole thing is confusing me.
[132:30.79]Did you hear that?
[132:32.30]What the fuck was that?
[132:33.78]I was like looking at Discord to see who was making that sound.
[132:36.06]That was the box.
[132:37.28]I opened the box.
[132:38.38]What did it do?
[132:39.56]It sung a song.
[132:41.82]A really weird song.
[132:47.45]Then it gave me a fucking sniper.
[132:57.84]I haven't spawned right in front of it.
[133:00.18]I'm hearing it again.
[133:04.28]Oh!
[133:04.68]It's South Park, dude.
[133:06.88]Is it South Park?
[133:07.72]Hang on, I'm gonna buy it again.
[133:11.16]Wow, a sniper.
[133:18.64]Or no, it's fucking Charlie the Unicorn.
[133:22.00]That's what it is.
[133:24.06]Wow, what a meme.
[133:26.56]Dude, I remember that part in Candyland, my favorite board game.
[133:31.14]Well, they're going to Candy Mountain.
[133:33.44]Come on, guys.
[133:36.02]I can see it.
[133:37.04]And I'm here to steal Christmas.
[133:39.80]Was that the dude from... Christmas.
[133:40.98]I told you every map is a Christmas map.
[133:42.51]You're right.
[133:43.69]Every map is Christmas.
[133:44.47]I'm here to steal Christmas.
[133:47.55]What?
[133:48.51]What is in that?
[133:49.53]I don't think anybody... I'm going to go get this stuff.
[133:52.95]Hold on.
[133:58.36]Was that an in-game, like, actual voice line that somebody says, or was that a mod?
[134:01.12]I think that was.
[134:01.96]That was one of the characters, yeah.
[134:03.92]Everything is modded to me, so I don't know what these characters actually sound like.
[134:07.10]The amount that can be modded, you can't trust anything.
[134:10.13]Guys, I'm running back to get ammo.
[134:11.39]Please don't let them kill me.
[134:12.93]I think that guy's gonna die out there.
[134:15.55]Oh, it disappeared when I got there.
[134:16.93]I'm giving back.
[134:17.75]I don't think he's gonna make it back.
[134:21.89]Oh my god, dude.
[134:23.64]Whoa, hey!
[134:24.00]Whoa!
[134:24.80]Breach!
[134:25.26]What the fuck?
[134:26.00]Dude!
[134:29.84]That's it.
[134:30.88]I'm getting back home.
[134:33.90]You got a fucking death machine.
[134:42.03]Yeah, it's just like a text.
[134:44.13]I love it.
[134:45.29]Watch out behind you.
[134:48.08]I'm like, I don't know.
[134:48.80]I'm counting on my team to keep these fucking zombies.
[134:50.92]I have a sniper, man.
[134:52.02]There we go.
[134:53.00]Alright now.
[134:56.58]The one place these zombies can't be allowed to
[135:07.51]They're like following Criken down the way.
[135:09.57]Wait.
[135:10.15]Is there like an invisible wall stopping me from shooting these guys?
[135:16.72]Save for the Jug.
[135:18.62]I made it back.
[135:19.44]Jug is here.
[135:20.00]I don't have enough.
[135:21.18]You guys need some money.
[135:22.96]You're loaded.
[135:23.58]You should buy our way through.
[135:24.82]Somebody should... Did somebody buy the Jug?
[135:29.19]Stretch.
[135:29.81]If you don't have Jug, buy Jug.
[135:31.77]Yeah.
[135:31.97]I don't have enough money for it yet.
[135:38.33]No, no, no!
[135:40.07]Maybe not after this round.
[135:41.23]What?
[135:41.85]Oh, we're gonna wipe and die.
[135:43.75]It's... No!
[135:46.03]No?
[135:50.39]Oh, man.
[135:51.15]This is way more than it came up the last time.
[135:54.31]No!
[135:55.47]It's over now!
[135:58.07]Okay.
[136:01.00]It happened so fast.
[136:02.76]Bye, Black Ops.
[136:03.78]Bye-bye.
[136:04.96]That was like a hundred zombies.
[136:07.65]Everyone say bye to Black Ops.
[136:09.01]Say bye, Black Ops.
[136:11.25]Criken, you are at least like one times better than everybody here.
[136:15.65]I'm one times better?
[136:17.11]You guys ruined my Candyland adventure.
[136:18.97]Well, I got my big, I had that big machine gun at the end.
[136:21.05]Oh, and the game crashed.
[136:22.69]Oh, I'm not crashed, dude.
[136:25.42]I'm good.
[136:27.38]You didn't crash?
[136:28.22]I didn't crash.
[136:29.30]Wow, I did.
[136:30.92]Dude, everyone but the host usually crashes.
[136:33.76]I don't know how many times the host doesn't crash.
[136:35.82]Alright.
[136:36.72]Everyone in everyone's chat, type 1 if you want Five Nights at Freddy's.
[136:39.92]Type 2 if you want Matrix Reloaded.
[136:41.70]Type 3 if you want Zombie Cat Tree.
[136:43.76]Type 4 if you want Turkey Survival.
[136:46.52]Type 5 if you want Bikini Bottoms Zombies.
[136:49.00]That one.
[136:49.26]Type 6 if you want Saw 3 Final Chapter.
[136:52.38]Alright.
[136:52.62]Let's tally them up.
[136:56.88]Watch your microphones.
[136:58.16]Oh, no.
[136:58.58]You guys are gonna get loud again.
[136:59.88]Yeah.
[137:00.54]I just caught mine when it boosted before I talked.
[137:04.90]It's like the second the game window opens.
[137:08.88]I will say the Saw ones are usually inspired.
[137:12.10]The Saw ones, I feel like they were so inspired that I think we forgot already having done this one and just completely like forgot about it because I'm pretty sure we did every Saw level.
[137:21.58]No, we didn't.
[137:22.26]We only did two.
[137:23.20]We only did two.
[137:24.86]There's BurgerTime Zombies V2 also, which I'm interested in.
[137:29.28]We definitely did that one.
[137:30.90]No, we didn't.
[137:32.32]We did BurgerTime.
[137:33.46]BurgerTime version 2, not version 1.
[137:35.20]Oh, okay.
[137:36.32]We did BurgerTime version 2.
[137:37.62]I'm positive.
[137:38.97]Let's see.
[137:43.81]Alright.
[137:44.11]Connected online.
[137:44.95]I'm seeing a lot of 5s and 1s in my chat.
[137:47.55]Okay.
[137:48.99]What was 1 and 5?
[137:49.53]Probably more 5s than 1s.
[137:50.47]Yeah, that's a lot of 5s.
[137:55.42]Five was, well, I don't remember.
[137:57.74]But, you know, I think it was either Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob Zombies.
[138:03.49]Yes, it was Bikini Bottom.
[138:05.17]Okay.
[138:06.53]I can't guarantee how good that one is.
[138:10.41]I can.
[138:11.23]I personally vetted every single one of these levels to make sure they were the absolute peak of quality that we come to expect from Black Ops 3 co-op zombies.
[138:22.30]Seems like they want the SpongeBob one.
[138:23.74]That's why you can find, if you scroll through the list, you'll find my favorite map, Cheese Cube, re-cheesed.
[138:29.02]Yeah, Cheese Cube does look good.
[138:30.56]That one's the keeper.
[138:33.26]Actually, I'll tell you what.
[138:34.86]There's a shockingly massive, like, subsection of Black Ops 3 map makers that are just obsessed with Cheese Cube.
[138:42.75]There's, like, a billion maps called Cheese Cube and then, like, colon and then a title.
[138:48.33]Well, I'm obsessed with Cheese Cubes.
[138:49.91]Have you ever had them before?
[138:50.61]They're pretty good.
[138:51.67]Yeah, well, I mean, like,
[138:53.34]Like Swiss cheese cubes?
[138:54.54]They're unbelievable.
[138:57.31]I mean, I'm just trying to think of why that's a Black Ops 3.
[139:00.11]Like, you know, why it has so much presence there.
[139:02.76]Maybe there's some kind of in thing with their community.
[139:08.44]I'd be like, let me just take a quick trip to the workshop.
[139:12.93]Why am I getting -2?
[139:14.31]That's not a joke.
[139:16.35]See?
[139:17.25]Me either.
[139:19.11]I just like the Swiss cheese cubes.
[139:21.17]That's not a joke.
[139:23.85]A lot of cheese maps.
[139:24.79]Do you guys also want to do the Game of Thrones map before Game of Thrones isn't cool anymore?
[139:28.78]Yeah, we can do that too.
[139:30.60]We got like four or five weeks for that.
[139:34.00]If you want to come back to this game...
[139:36.79]No, we don't do this more than once every year.
[139:39.69]It's annual.
[139:42.55]I mean, it might as well be.
[139:43.69]When did we do the last one?
[139:44.97]I think it was October.
[139:46.47]Yeah.
[139:48.43]Wow.
[139:49.59]New version.
[139:50.51]If you've never seen Game of Thrones, this is not it.
[139:53.15]Okay, this is Spongebob.
[139:54.75]Be careful.
[139:56.35]Game of Thrones spoilers.
[140:01.07]This is a new version.
[140:01.93]There is also about 20 different SpongeBob zombies maps that all look the same, so I just grabbed one.
[140:07.48]Okay.
[140:07.74]I don't know if this was the real one, but there are... Oh, we're under the ocean.
[140:15.04]We seem huge.
[140:17.42]Yeah, I mean, humans are probably really big to SpongeBob.
[140:20.10]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[140:20.80]He is just like a sponge.
[140:21.66]Wow, the Flying Dutchman.
[140:23.50]What the fuck?
[140:25.02]What the fuck?
[140:25.72]Got him.
[140:25.94]Got him.
[140:26.86]Got him.
[140:28.76]Taken care of.
[140:30.56]Wow, you get hit markers whenever you shoot one, dude.
[140:33.96]Oh, no.
[140:35.56]Oh, no.
[140:36.20]Whenever you shoot one, you get that nice click.
[140:38.92]Oh, it's going to be so annoying.
[140:41.18]Dude, I love that.
[140:44.13]Oh, I found the power.
[140:46.39]Oh, that's nice.
[140:51.61]Okay.
[140:53.27]Hey.
[140:55.69]I love that hit marker.
[140:58.28]Is there like a light blue?
[140:59.40]Are they just different colors?
[141:00.56]I think they're just different colors.
[141:01.74]They're just different popsicle flavors of the Flying Dutchman.
[141:06.08]Why is this the only level that we've played so far?
[141:09.63]I think ever that has hit markers for the zombies.
[141:15.05]I don't know.
[141:15.65]Nice, dude.
[141:21.98]My eyes are adjusting to all the green and blue.
[141:26.24]Hey, this is kind of a headache map, ain't it?
[141:31.12]What are they doing?
[141:33.77]You think this is a headache map?
[141:36.51]Let me introduce you to Cheese Cube Re-Cheese, friend.
[141:40.49]That one.
[141:42.35]That one will be the finale to them.
[141:43.71]They're coming behind us, right?
[141:49.27]What is that?
[141:49.69]It's like a zap thing.
[141:53.19]I got, like, lightning.
[141:54.51]I don't know what that did.
[141:55.67]It's a bomb.
[141:56.81]Explosion.
[141:59.77]Uh, does someone want to go visit Larry the Lobster?
[142:02.60]I love Larry.
[142:03.50]Okay.
[142:03.86]I'll go visit him.
[142:04.62]Where do I find him?
[142:05.58]It's too expensive.
[142:06.54]I don't want to go there.
[142:07.26]How much is Larry?
[142:07.84]No, I'll do it.
[142:08.82]Where?
[142:09.42]It's right here.
[142:11.40]He's got all the girl fish around him.
[142:13.38]Oh, my God.
[142:14.34]Classic Larry.
[142:15.74]I mean, half those are definitely men fish.
[142:17.73]I can tell.
[142:18.71]I know my SpongeBob lore.
[142:23.68]Oh, so satisfying when you hit it.
[142:27.26]What is that?
[142:28.32]I don't know.
[142:30.09]It's like a heart.
[142:30.73]Did you hear that?
[142:32.13]Whoa!
[142:35.19]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[142:36.67]Why, you guys want to go see Larry?
[142:38.77]You have like a trail on you.
[142:41.15]Me?
[142:41.79]Yeah.
[142:43.34]I don't know what that means.
[142:45.86]Wait, what's a trail?
[142:47.36]See that?
[142:47.86]See that like cloud?
[142:50.46]Are we leaving this guy alive?
[142:51.26]He's got this sort of stench around him.
[142:54.06]No, no, keep that one alive for a minute.
[142:55.38]I didn't do it.
[142:56.08]I didn't do it this time.
[142:56.94]I didn't do it.
[142:58.26]Guys, come on.
[142:59.74]I opened the way to Larry.
[143:01.02]Okay.
[143:02.70]Yeah, I got us to Larry.
[143:04.27]What is this?
[143:04.83]Wait, we opened this way too.
[143:06.45]Yeah, we have two ways to go.
[143:07.87]Did it open both sides when I bought it?
[143:09.85]Oh, there's a golden spatula over here.
[143:13.59]Dude, look at how much fun all these guys are having.
[143:20.49]Bang, bang.
[143:21.13]I need the power first.
[143:25.04]I guess it doesn't work for this one over here.
[143:26.62]Oh, that guy drops power up.
[143:28.54]Different power.
[143:29.32]What's the handcuff power up?
[143:32.18]Handcuffs?
[143:34.22]Just so you guys know, there's actually a continuity.
[143:36.52]There's a lore continuity to these maps.
[143:38.39]Because there's also a map made by this guy, I think, that takes place in Rock Bottom.
[143:42.55]You know, the place below Bikini Bottom.
[143:44.83]Are we traveling there?
[143:46.21]We're going to go there after.
[143:48.55]No, I mean, I don't know if they built it.
[143:49.89]We're going to play the whole story.
[143:51.53]We got to get the story.
[143:52.55]We're going to see every episode.
[143:54.09]Oh, we're almost at the Krusty Krab.
[143:56.44]I'm going in.
[143:58.12]That's how cars work.
[144:01.64]There he is, Mr. Krabs.
[144:03.52]There he is, T-posing like always.
[144:05.16]Like every other model in these.
[144:09.32]He actually does T-pose a lot in the show, though.
[144:12.50]His elbows are always like out.
[144:16.81]Which one of these is worse?
[144:19.67]These are weapons.
[144:20.31]I don't even know what a good weapon or bad weapon is in this game.
[144:24.18]Is that good?
[144:26.02]Just use it.
[144:27.12]Use it.
[144:28.24]Okay.
[144:29.74]I'm dead.
[144:32.20]Oh, no.
[144:32.92]James, you're the only one I trust to save me.
[144:36.25]Where are you?
[144:36.85]Way by Krusty Krab.
[144:39.57]Dutchman number 25 kicked my ass.
[144:43.05]Yeah, I'm getting some points right now, man.
[144:47.05]How the fuck did- where are- where are you?
[144:49.55]We're like splat- we're splat out.
[144:51.35]I need a new gun.
[145:01.22]There's a box over here.
[145:03.90]Yeah, I mean I also need money.
[145:05.04]Somehow I'm stuck with 20 bucks right now.
[145:07.31]What is our objective here?
[145:08.61]I'm really having a hard time- Krusty Krab!
[145:11.28]Yeah, alright, that checks out.
[145:12.96]Wait, how in the fuck is this the first level you've been asking what's our objective?
[145:16.80]This is like every zombie.
[145:18.95]Is you open doors and then move forward.
[145:21.81]I've never thought of Spongebob as like a... What is that?
[145:25.19]Oh, is everyone slow motion?
[145:26.87]Is that what that's doing?
[145:29.05]Yeah, it is.
[145:29.87]Ooh, that's nice.
[145:33.74]All I hear is the clicks.
[145:35.74]Dude, I love the clicks.
[145:37.32]Silent gun, yeah.
[145:39.96]All I hear is the...
[145:45.24]Holy shit.
[145:48.52]They're all standing still, yeah.
[145:50.80]Yeah, we got some sort of hourglass power-up.
[145:56.18]Should I open up a custom power-up?
[145:58.64]Yeah, get whatever you can.
[146:00.54]We should get a crawler first or something.
[146:03.37]Yeah.
[146:04.67]Oh, the ray gun.
[146:05.77]I'm going to go to Krusty Krab.
[146:07.35]Screw you guys.
[146:09.37]Wait.
[146:11.03]Manta Man's here.
[146:12.33]That stays until I die, right?
[146:14.45]Yeah, when you go down.
[146:15.94]Like, not when you die.
[146:16.84]When you fall over, you lose it.
[146:18.44]Squidward!
[146:19.74]Which is why Juggernaug is so good.
[146:24.90]What was that?
[146:25.54]Zombie cash.
[146:26.72]Oh, fuck!
[146:28.92]I got zombie cash, and then the fucking box went away.
[146:32.34]Guys, get over here.
[146:32.96]Get over here quick.
[146:34.05]I got something to show you.
[146:35.65]Oh, there's a soul box for Tibbs.
[146:37.89]Oh, God!
[146:40.35]Taxi!
[146:41.75]I'm here.
[146:42.81]Alright, ready?
[146:43.31]Watch this.
[146:45.07]Start, Squidward.
[146:47.26]What do we do?
[146:47.56]Okay.
[146:47.68]What do we do?
[146:48.60]I don't know.
[146:48.96]Are you racing?
[146:49.76]Do we have to run?
[146:50.70]Maybe.
[146:51.64]That's a car there.
[146:53.90]What was this for?
[146:55.46]I just... Okay, keep going.
[146:59.53]What the fuck was the point of this, dude?
[147:01.21]I don't know.
[147:01.83]I don't know.
[147:02.29]And then we go this way?
[147:03.95]This sucks.
[147:05.27]What's happening?
[147:06.67]Oh, you betrayed your weapon.
[147:07.85]Oh, shit.
[147:08.32]This sucks.
[147:11.77]Who wants my gun?
[147:12.85]Oh, I don't want that thing.
[147:13.93]Oh, there's a, uh... There's another power thing we gotta turn on here.
[147:18.44]Damn.
[147:19.48]I don't remember this part in Spongebob anymore.
[147:21.58]We need three keys.
[147:22.62]Criken, I found what we need.
[147:24.06]Okay.
[147:24.44]Three keys.
[147:25.32]We're trying to get to the... what, uh... castle?
[147:28.76]I don't remember there being a castle in Spongebob.
[147:30.42]So, each perk also has the power on the side of it to activate.
[147:34.40]Oh, you can trade weapons in this.
[147:35.78]Oh, there's a golden ice cream!
[147:37.12]Golden ice cream!
[147:38.26]Yeah?
[147:38.62]Okay.
[147:40.56]What?
[147:41.08]What does it do?
[147:41.52]Oh my god, I got zombie blood.
[147:43.73]For some reason.
[147:45.67]Nice.
[147:45.93]I don't know what's happening.
[147:48.57]There's a trading bench here.
[147:49.97]If someone has a good weapon, they want to trade to someone else.
[147:53.21]Do you guys have enough for the Pack-a-Punch?
[147:55.31]Because I could open this gate for you.
[147:56.83]Nah, save that for now.
[147:58.53]We're all bankrupt as shit.
[147:59.52]You must turn the power on first.
[148:02.26]I have no weapon.
[148:03.44]Can you see the box anywhere?
[148:06.02]That box was on the other side of Bikini Bottom.
[148:09.90]I'm going to finish this taxi ride thing.
[148:11.92]I reset it though.
[148:12.92]I fucked it up.
[148:13.78]What?
[148:14.30]No.
[148:14.72]Where's the juggernaut?
[148:15.98]I ran all the way back here to get all of it.
[148:17.70]I actually have no idea because it looks like it's using a different model for this mod.
[148:20.52]I haven't seen any of that.
[148:22.84]Help me out killing zombies near this box.
[148:26.28]I have no fucking ammo.
[148:27.71]Don't kill him up there.
[148:28.43]Kill him near this box.
[148:29.25]It looks like it's taking this.
[148:30.53]Is it draining into the box?
[148:32.25]I'm going to die.
[148:36.61]I'll cover your back.
[148:37.31]Go get him.
[148:40.76]I got him.
[148:42.06]Three, two, one.
[148:43.08]Oops.
[148:43.34]There's somebody down here.
[148:46.70]This is the wall, this is the gear check.
[148:47.88]I don't know where the fucking, where's the box?
[148:54.29]The box isn't here.
[149:07.31]I don't know where the box went, man.
[149:09.35]Should we open this door?
[149:12.55]Let's just open whatever we see that you can afford, because everything else is like 5,000 bucks and we have to find a key for it.
[149:17.23]This is power?
[149:18.11]Oh, power!
[149:20.97]What does that turn on?
[149:21.63]Dumpster power.
[149:22.65]There's another bottle thing here for electricity.
[149:27.79]Where did I get these at?
[149:30.53]I wouldn't buy anything that none of us recognize, like, from the, like, word of it.
[149:34.71]I... Oh, wait.
[149:35.47]I know what electric cherry is.
[149:36.47]When you reload, it does, like, an electrical, like, circuit that hits everything around you, which is actually pretty good.
[149:42.38]That's pretty cool.
[149:43.16]I mean, I got two grand.
[149:44.08]Maybe I should get electric cherry.
[149:45.88]Yeah.
[149:46.18]Maybe balance some electric cherry through your closed scuba diving visor.
[149:51.40]I need ammo, though.
[149:54.07]Ammo is... What's the range on it?
[149:57.82]I think it's... Well, I mean, if you shoot one bullet and then reload it, I think you can see.
[150:02.41]Oh, okay.
[150:02.69]Yeah, it's, like, to about where I am right now from you.
[150:05.83]Oh, wow.
[150:06.29]Alright.
[150:06.69]Oh, that's a gun.
[150:07.77]It's pretty good for, like, guys getting on.
[150:09.63]Whoa, that's a good gun.
[150:15.32]I need to get a wall gun so I have ammo.
[150:17.22]Fuck's sake.
[150:22.38]There was a gun around here on the wall.
[150:24.08]There was like a dual wheel.
[150:24.98]We got to get together because the spawn is on the wrong.
[150:27.31]Yeah.
[150:27.51]This wall is... This wave is going to be awful.
[150:31.23]Let's do it by Krusty Krab.
[150:32.71]Yeah.
[150:33.23]I'm at Krusty Krab.
[150:38.11]I'm not really sure.
[150:38.79]I don't know where the keys are that we're looking for.
[150:44.42]Yeah.
[150:44.52]I haven't seen any keys.
[150:46.62]I mean there's another road by that castle that we didn't go down.
[150:49.96]No.
[151:00.35]I don't know what I did that for!
[151:05.51]I don't know why I did that, I just... God damn it, I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[151:14.36]I was trying to kill everybody.
[151:18.20]I don't know, it was like the range, and I was like, I got range, do it.
[151:21.07]Oh my god, what an idiot.
[151:23.13]He had the fucking bloodlust in his eyes.
[151:26.25]I think that happens to them.
[151:27.67]Hey look, over there!
[151:28.79]There's an item, go get it!
[151:30.01]I NEED IT!
[151:33.89]I lost two cards.
[151:36.91]I thought I could go and like, electrocute them and kill them or something, I don't know how much damage it did.
[151:41.45]It doesn't do enough that you're gonna be killing zombies, but it stuns them.
[151:46.06]It's alright, I'm just an idiot.
[151:48.70]Hey, I mean, hey!
[151:50.52]It's all about, you're getting better.
[151:54.08]There's a box over here.
[151:56.33]think yeah there's a box over here yeah oh the round just started as well oh uh I'm totally from you guys I'm behind James you're here let's just go to this castle I guess James because we're split from them it's just you and me cracking alright you want box see this road here we never went down this way look here that's where they are hey this is where it's out everyone get box
[152:23.32]What is it?
[152:23.68]What is it?
[152:23.98]Did anyone see any keys?
[152:25.34]Okay, what's worse?
[152:25.96]M27 or M8A1?
[152:26.84]I don't know.
[152:29.04]Don't take that.
[152:29.42]It's a shitty shotgun.
[152:30.26]What?
[152:31.40]Don't take shotgun.
[152:32.34]Oh, don't take it.
[152:32.92]Let it melt.
[152:37.20]That's all I could afford.
[152:38.10]I think I figured... Oh, behind you.
[152:39.78]Behind you.
[152:40.94]What?
[152:42.14]Ow, what?
[152:42.86]Behind who?
[152:44.23]I don't know.
[152:44.73]Whoever was at the box.
[152:45.47]Everybody.
[152:46.43]Turn around.
[152:47.89]If you want to use it again, I'll cover you if you have enough for it.
[152:50.17]I don't have enough.
[152:51.41]Uh-uh.
[152:53.26]Oh no.
[152:55.16]They're coming.
[152:56.86]Hey guys, I think I know where the keys are.
[152:59.18]You see that, see right across this barricade here, that little box?
[153:02.52]Those things eat souls.
[153:04.36]There was one by the Krusty Krab that I was trying to fill up.
[153:06.36]I bet if we fill it up with souls... Dude, I have no ammo.
[153:10.54]Fuck.
[153:11.00]There's a clone behind you.
[153:12.64]No!
[153:14.24]Oh my god.
[153:15.18]Help me, dude.
[153:18.72]I love all that hate going on.
[153:19.80]Oh, what happened?
[153:21.33]We're going down!
[153:22.31]No, no, no, no.
[153:22.79]Don't say that.
[153:23.25]Don't say that.
[153:27.95]Get a crawler.
[153:28.61]Get a crawler.
[153:29.03]I really need that x2.
[153:29.59]Whoa.
[153:29.87]Okay.
[153:30.55]I think we're good.
[153:39.84]Oh, this is awful.
[153:43.36]This might work.
[153:45.12]Has anyone seen a juggernaut?
[153:47.02]I don't think.
[153:49.13]I got like a spark.
[153:49.93]Oh, that thing sucks.
[153:52.39]Yeah, that's the starter pistol, dude.
[153:55.33]Help.
[153:56.19]Did you get a fucking rocket?
[153:58.15]I mean, rockets are shit.
[153:59.85]I'm not super thrilled about this thing.
[154:02.95]Got a lot of ammo for it, though.
[154:04.17]Apparently there's a juggernaut by the chum bucket.
[154:07.85]Might be worth an investigation.
[154:09.37]That's the bacon mark.
[154:11.86]Where is this chum bucket?
[154:15.62]Where's the chum bucket?
[154:16.16]Oh, it's right next to the... It's right there.
[154:18.14]I see it.
[154:19.50]Down this road.
[154:21.91]Why was there a plane coming from there?
[154:24.81]Wait, why is there... Goddammit, we need a crawler.
[154:26.94]Oh, I didn't realize that was the last thing.
[154:29.38]No, no.
[154:30.92]Shit.
[154:31.22]Where is it?
[154:31.92]Over here?
[154:33.00]It's up here.
[154:33.74]We should do this anyways because there's a box here we need to get souls into.
[154:37.46]I have no ammo.
[154:38.86]This is the Chum Bucket.
[154:40.98]Chum Bucket.
[154:42.43]Juggernaut was near Chum Bucket, somebody said, over here.
[154:44.37]I have no ammo.
[154:46.15]Come this way, Criken.
[154:46.91]I'm covering you.
[154:47.45]Are you trolled?
[154:50.05]Yeah, it's right here.
[154:50.77]It's right on me.
[154:51.55]Wee!
[154:51.95]No, it's on me.
[154:53.47]Oh, there it is.
[154:53.91]Not anyone has enough money.
[154:55.49]I do.
[154:56.55]I do.
[154:57.69]We want to kill stuff by this box.
[154:59.23]I think that's how we get the keys.
[155:02.51]Handcuffs over there.
[155:03.95]What the fuck are those?
[155:06.15]Boots.
[155:07.85]Oh, there we go.
[155:09.41]Handcuffs.
[155:12.09]We got infinite ammo.
[155:12.85]Just unload.
[155:14.97]I am a god.
[155:15.73]Oh, fuck.
[155:18.20]Oh, I got missile launchers for this.
[155:19.69]But what about my accuracy rating?
[155:20.99]Who cares, dude?
[155:21.59]Just who cares?
[155:23.81]You got him.
[155:30.20]I think you shot him.
[155:31.62]We seriously need a follower here.
[155:36.27]They're spawning on top of us.
[155:37.94]What is that?
[155:39.28]What killed you?
[155:40.06]Dude, you robbed me!
[155:41.66]What did she do?
[155:43.76]Where'd you guys go?
[155:44.48]Freaking got his head right in my face.
[155:47.70]Then a missile hit him.
[155:48.60]Nothing, baby.
[155:49.60]There it is.
[155:50.82]What's this do again?
[155:51.95]Extra power?
[155:53.17]Extra hits before you go down.
[155:54.89]Alright, just don't kill the... This one right there, dude.
[155:57.69]I'm going to kite this one.
[156:00.85]That's a normal one.
[156:02.35]It's fine.
[156:02.95]He's never gonna catch me.
[156:04.57]You guys do what you gotta do.
[156:05.32]How you guys doing on ammo?
[156:06.16]Good?
[156:06.94]I'm bankrupt, so I need something to do with my time.
[156:09.32]I had to buy a new gun because I was out of ammo.
[156:11.72]Hey.
[156:12.01]Alright.
[156:12.53]It looks like I'm the only one with fucking fat stats.
[156:14.71]You got 9,800 bucks.
[156:17.58]Yeah, I've been waiting to fucking buy stuff, but you guys keep killing the last one.
[156:22.64]Go!
[156:22.96]Go!
[156:23.32]Buy it!
[156:24.14]I'm going.
[156:24.56]Where should I... What should I buy?
[156:25.92]I mean, if you kill this thing, you can actually have enough to both open the Pack-a-Punch door and Pack-a-Punch, probably.
[156:32.18]Or be close.
[156:32.72]I could open the gate.
[156:34.36]It's over here.
[156:34.82]It's by the gate.
[156:35.92]By this castle.
[156:36.36]Do it.
[156:36.64]Do it.
[156:36.92]Do it.
[156:37.16]All this cash.
[156:40.58]Would that push you up enough?
[156:43.38]Would that get you 180 if you also got every hit on this guy?
[156:48.08]I don't have enough.
[156:48.74]I'm off by 200.
[156:50.36]If you shoot this guy a couple of times in the body, then finish him off with a knife.
[156:54.16]What is this?
[156:54.72]Perka-Cola.
[156:55.54]You could get a Perka-Cola over here.
[156:56.90]Is that a random perk?
[157:00.38]Dig?
[157:01.22]Dig.
[157:01.54]Is there anything else that I can do for progress?
[157:04.15]It's loud.
[157:04.63]It's loud.
[157:05.09]It's loud.
[157:05.45]It's loud.
[157:05.81]It's loud.
[157:06.11]Why did everybody tell me to dig?
[157:08.81]I don't know what this is.
[157:09.45]Dig.
[157:09.55]He's getting in here.
[157:11.59]He's in here.
[157:12.35]Perk and Cola gives you a random perk.
[157:15.35]On the road?
[157:15.73]You can dig on the road?
[157:16.95]Yo, James, I genuinely think if you shoot this thing like a couple times and knife him, you'll get enough for it.
[157:26.38]Dig.
[157:26.82]But is there any more progress that we could do with the money instead?
[157:30.40]Not really.
[157:31.36]No, no.
[157:31.68]I think you should buy a good gun.
[157:32.98]I think it's time to get a good gun.
[157:35.12]Are you guys seeing this dig?
[157:38.85]Somebody said they could dig.
[157:39.85]Oh, I see it.
[157:41.23]I see one.
[157:42.02]It's this skull thing.
[157:42.86]I know.
[157:43.14]I've been doing that all the time.
[157:44.34]It does nothing.
[157:44.98]It doesn't do anything?
[157:45.92]No?
[157:46.20]Okay.
[157:46.76]I did it.
[157:47.42]There.
[157:48.96]Hang on.
[157:49.14]I think I'm the only one who got the... Hang on.
[157:50.82]I'm going to run around with the shovel and dig all this stuff.
[157:53.60]Oh, I got one.
[157:54.48]I just got one.
[157:55.44]You got a key?
[157:56.10]Okay.
[157:56.94]The keys are in the dirt.
[157:57.70]They're in the skull pile.
[157:58.68]They're in the skull pile.
[157:59.80]Sorry.
[158:01.20]It's a search around for those before we kill this last one.
[158:04.18]I don't know about you guys, but my chest has literally been quoting Spongebob for the last hour.
[158:08.48]What did you expect?
[158:09.22]Also, I mean, we've only been playing for like 20 minutes, so it's sort of weird they've been going for... They just really like SpongeBob, dude.
[158:16.26]Your place is a safe haven for their community.
[158:18.88]2,000?
[158:20.08]I got one key here, so... A Squidward.
[158:28.19]What does the fucking pile look like?
[158:30.53]Follow me.
[158:31.07]It's a weird muddy skull pile.
[158:32.91]Like a pile of bones and dirt.
[158:34.47]Mud.
[158:35.66]Debris.
[158:38.71]Am I just following?
[158:41.33]Yeah, I'm just following Criken.
[158:42.65]I got no money.
[158:43.53]Hey, I got no money either, pal.
[158:45.01]We're just kind of walking around.
[158:48.05]Look, James, over by me.
[158:50.01]You found one?
[158:51.19]Yeah, there's a pile here if you want to see what it looks like.
[158:54.91]It looks exactly like a pile of garbage with bones in it.
[158:58.61]There's a thing here.
[159:00.03]Oh, that's not it.
[159:02.33]Where?
[159:03.97]Wait, James, we got to open this door over here.
[159:05.91]See that?
[159:07.02]Oh, wow.
[159:08.10]Look at that.
[159:09.36]I didn't get anything out of that one.
[159:11.34]So how many keys do we have?
[159:12.46]How many keys?
[159:14.22]I'm going to kill this motherfucker, alright?
[159:17.02]Why are you doing this?
[159:18.32]Oh, don't do that.
[159:20.04]Because I'm getting bored, dude.
[159:21.40]I want to move on.
[159:22.14]Oh, you're getting bored.
[159:23.49]There's a door over here.
[159:24.25]I'm a resident shaper.
[159:28.57]I'm gonna die.
[159:29.01]I'm gonna die.
[159:29.43]I'm not kidding.
[159:30.03]I'm gonna die.
[159:32.75]I'm gonna die.
[159:34.43]It's one zombie.
[159:35.11]I just locked myself with the boat, and I was died.
[159:38.09]It's easy to do that.
[159:43.22]Okay, well, I didn't see any more places to get keys, which makes me believe that it's still those soul boxes.
[159:48.74]Criken, I dare you to shoot him.
[159:51.79]Okay, you did.
[159:52.79]You actually did.
[159:55.06]Alright, now it's time for me to shoot him.
[159:56.34]No, no!
[159:57.55]Alright, I still didn't get enough.
[160:00.71]Alright, guys, open this.
[160:01.51]Open this.
[160:03.43]We don't have three.
[160:04.09]We only have one key.
[160:06.65]Okay.
[160:06.91]I'm telling you guys, the rest of them, we gotta kill zombies near these boxes.
[160:10.17]Those take the souls of the zombies.
[160:12.37]That would be so bad if that's true.
[160:14.08]Wouldn't be the first time some bullshit has happened in a zombies mod.
[160:18.68]Alright, I'm pack-a-punchin'.
[160:24.31]max ammo oh my god what the fuck is this see this is easy look at that they die right here anyways are they behind me yeah there was one they're behind you guys as well my leg that was the worst
[160:54.85]Oh my god.
[161:00.93]Yeah.
[161:02.09]I've seen them pop up before too.
[161:04.45]They're spawning behind us.
[161:15.02]They're trying to spawn behind us.
[161:17.46]Oh, it gave us a nuke.
[161:19.02]Alright, these things are garbage.
[161:20.24]We don't need them.
[161:23.47]We're gonna have to hunt these keys with our own creativity and ingenuity.
[161:29.18]I think there's another way to our right.
[161:31.14]Yeah, right here.
[161:32.16]Are you okay?
[161:33.06]Oh, there it is.
[161:34.48]Pack a punch?
[161:35.22]Is this the last one?
[161:35.92]Oh, shit.
[161:37.25]Pack a punch, M16.
[161:40.08]Wait, don't kill!
[161:41.34]Why?
[161:42.14]Why?
[161:42.92]Where's the pack a punch?
[161:44.06]Why?
[161:44.34]Where's the punch?
[161:45.32]Why are you this way?
[161:47.34]Wait, Sherman, what do you need?
[161:48.72]I want pack a punch.
[161:50.08]Pack a punch?
[161:50.72]You need 5,000 and you put it in here.
[161:53.08]Oh.
[161:53.73]Well, I only have 4,000.
[161:58.43]And then you just put in whatever gun you want and it'll, like, make it a super.
[162:01.45]A super gun?
[162:02.79]Yeah, it'll be objectively super.
[162:05.41]Nice.
[162:05.73]Alright.
[162:05.97]Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
[162:06.53]I'm gonna try it.
[162:08.41]But then definitely don't die, because you'll lose that.
[162:10.41]Oh, I will.
[162:11.45]I'm going to.
[162:12.85]And that'll set you back.
[162:15.49]There'll be, like, fail fishes, like, every five seconds.
[162:17.90]Yeah.
[162:18.06]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[162:20.44]M16, right?
[162:21.20]Let's do it.
[162:25.98]Warp hit.
[162:29.71]Dude, now this is giving me some hit markers.
[162:32.47]Completed!
[162:34.91]Completed what?
[162:36.13]I finished the route with taxi.
[162:38.63]I'm gonna go back to scuba and get a key.
[162:39.95]I got a legendary.
[162:43.49]How do you know that?
[162:44.47]Dude, you want to play?
[162:45.25]Hey, you want to press F on this?
[162:51.19]Oh, man.
[162:53.43]I bet you could trade your Pack-a-Punch.
[162:55.71]Keys!
[162:55.91]Wait, I'm not gonna take keys.
[162:56.73]Come over here for a second.
[162:57.84]Keys?
[162:59.82]I want to see if this is possible.
[163:01.34]Alright, guys.
[163:02.08]I'm pretty sure.
[163:03.04]Can you put a bag of lunch on that chest?
[163:04.68]I can put it on there.
[163:05.56]Yeah, I can.
[163:06.56]Jesus, that's bad.
[163:08.67]It's a crawler.
[163:09.41]Don't kill the crawler.
[163:10.39]I'm about to get down.
[163:11.95]How do I do it?
[163:13.23]Any help?
[163:13.63]I don't know if we can make it to you right now, man.
[163:20.37]Actually, we're not too far.
[163:21.98]Someone's got to keep them off me when I go for you.
[163:24.58]Keep them off me.
[163:25.18]There's still spawning here as well.
[163:27.16]Behind you.
[163:27.88]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[163:30.27]I mean, there's no one here.
[163:31.65]I mean, there were people.
[163:32.95]That's why I was to 50% health right away.
[163:35.13]I got you, buddy.
[163:38.59]Alright.
[163:38.83]So, I got the second key.
[163:39.81]There's a crawler right here.
[163:44.62]There's another one.
[163:45.12]Look, look, look.
[163:45.78]There's another like Ghostbusters ghost.
[163:47.90]I got a spare guy over here.
[163:50.70]I wasn't just gonna do that if I didn't know.
[163:52.84]This isn't The Binding of Isaac level.
[163:55.83]I'm not gonna jump off a cliff or anything.
[163:56.93]We have an extra guy by me.
[163:59.03]I'm gonna go Pack-a-Punch.
[164:00.81]I think we've gotta feed the souls to the little shiny boxes because we've gotten two keys two different ways.
[164:05.84]I think this is the third way.
[164:07.28]What else is on that pathway that you opened?
[164:09.86]Is that it?
[164:10.60]That's it.
[164:12.10]Yeah.
[164:12.78]All we got from the shiny box that was here was a nuke.
[164:15.94]Yeah, but we didn't get anything from the other holes that we dug, so.
[164:20.83]You don't want to do one more pass through and look around?
[164:23.17]I want double tap.
[164:26.37]Sure.
[164:26.89]Nothing else is viable?
[164:28.79]Nothing is viable.
[164:30.97]Is double tap over there by you, Criken?
[164:34.31]Uh, bomb stoppers.
[164:36.25]Oh, bomb floppers.
[164:37.17]Bomb floppers.
[164:38.53]That's what I did when I killed us all on the Isaac one.
[164:42.67]I think double tap was by the beginning.
[164:45.66]Was it?
[164:45.96]All the way back there?
[164:46.58]Hang on.
[164:47.88]I'm over here now.
[164:48.54]I'll look for you.
[164:49.52]Is quick reload around here?
[164:52.12]I'll tell you guys.
[164:52.60]Is that even on this fucking map?
[164:53.68]Oh, yeah.
[164:54.66]Over by me is double tap.
[164:57.36]Get that.
[164:59.24]Way over.
[165:00.41]Oh, that's a long.
[165:01.43]Pretty close to the crystal crab.
[165:03.15]Oh, I fucking bought the wrong one.
[165:06.27]That's a kick in the pants, guys.
[165:07.97]Yeah, I'm not going to get mule kick.
[165:09.45]I'll get something else.
[165:11.19]I'll just get the random one.
[165:15.06]The random one is pretty good if you have enough money to just like gun a hundred of them.
[165:19.74]Might as well.
[165:20.42]Bang, bang.
[165:21.00]There it is.
[165:21.82]Double tap.
[165:22.28]Oh my god, that's loud.
[165:23.22]What?
[165:24.32]What?
[165:29.28]Is there any paths we somehow missed?
[165:32.52]Was that quick reload?
[165:33.34]Did I just actually get fucking reload?
[165:35.98]What the fuck?
[165:37.50]Alright, where are we going to put our position ourselves?
[165:40.61]That's amazing.
[165:41.97]I don't know.
[165:42.33]I was trying to see if there was any, like, paths we missed because we're still... That's... Okay.
[165:49.41]Hmm.
[165:51.06]Is there only one little box that you can... I know there's one box that's over here that I had to buy a thing to get to, so I'm pretty sure that's it.
[165:57.21]There's one box by the Krusty Krab.
[165:59.19]Is there anything on the box that shows that maybe it's... There's one over here.
[166:02.67]Well, look.
[166:03.09]I had to literally... It's at the corner of the map, and I had to buy a way to get into it.
[166:06.37]There's nothing else here.
[166:07.06]So I figure if anything... Inside the car.
[166:10.14]What was that?
[166:12.04]James.
[166:12.44]Oh, I thought that was a zombie.
[166:14.76]No.
[166:15.52]I'm buying perks.
[166:17.40]Oh, okay.
[166:20.02]Electric cherry was good, but I only used it once.
[166:23.10]Yeah, electric cherry is really good when every other perk is stacked with it, because you're, like, reloading faster and you're moving faster, so you're hitting more shit with it.
[166:29.66]I don't know.
[166:33.33]If we make it through a couple more rounds without going down, we'll be pretty much... Dude, what is that?
[166:37.91]It's the widow one.
[166:38.79]I don't even know what the fuck the widow one does.
[166:40.39]Uh... That one gives you a special kind of grenade.
[166:43.53]Oh...
[166:47.14]Oh, watch out.
[166:48.00]The guys are still in here.
[166:48.82]Yeah, watch out for the... He just stepped on the crawler.
[166:54.84]They're cluster grenades.
[166:56.14]Ooh.
[166:56.45]Maybe the race is to get the key?
[167:00.09]He got one from the race.
[167:01.19]Oh, they already got one.
[167:02.05]Okay.
[167:02.93]Yeah.
[167:03.69]Why is he not aggroing on me?
[167:04.85]Poor bastard's confused.
[167:06.13]He doesn't know who to go after anymore.
[167:07.65]What the fuck?
[167:08.75]I can get one more.
[167:09.45]Can you get him stuck here?
[167:11.17]The boat?
[167:13.98]I'm gonna kill him.
[167:14.48]I'm gonna kill him.
[167:16.11]No!
[167:16.37]Try to stop me.
[167:17.41]Stay away from him!
[167:18.43]Try to stop me.
[167:20.59]Rip.
[167:21.58]What the fuck is that one?
[167:25.12]Wait, did you get Tombstone?
[167:27.42]It's Rip, yeah.
[167:28.64]Uh, when you die, you're gonna drop a Tombstone, which will mean that when you respawn, you can recollect your perks.
[167:34.04]Oh, that's nice.
[167:35.24]Haha.
[167:35.74]Yeah, don't do that.
[167:36.44]Over here, guys.
[167:38.18]Turn left.
[167:38.98]If there's one thing I know, it's Call of Duty Black Ops 3 perks.
[167:44.32]and their various ability.
[167:45.94]This is where the shiny box is.
[167:50.22]Oh, this place is... Is it already filled up though?
[167:52.75]No.
[167:53.55]Oh, is this... Oh.
[167:54.67]I guess it's just camp in this corner.
[167:56.43]Yeah.
[167:56.71]This is what I've been telling you all along.
[168:00.03]None of y'all believes me.
[168:02.49]I still don't want a nuke box.
[168:04.71]I wonder how many you got to kill.
[168:06.29]You see those little orbs?
[168:08.73]They're not getting close enough yet.
[168:10.89]You see those little orbs that go into it?
[168:12.37]Those are their souls.
[168:14.86]Let me see what they're saying.
[168:16.52]Uh, golden, um, golden IV bag, whatever it is.
[168:25.93]Oh my god, get your face out of my face!
[168:30.73]You would think that it has enough by now.
[168:32.63]Yeah, it's got like a hundred people.
[168:37.01]The other one took like a whole round to charge.
[168:39.75]Yeah, we gotta wait till they're closer.
[168:41.71]How could you tell when it actually got finished?
[168:43.92]It opened and just disappeared, and there was a pickup where it was.
[168:47.16]Oh.
[168:48.90]Got a power-up over there.
[168:50.00]Boots.
[168:51.12]Boots.
[168:51.94]Ooh.
[168:52.96]Oh, and infinite ammo, too.
[168:55.53]Oh, wait, wait.
[168:56.29]Don't spam.
[168:56.71]Oh, it disappeared.
[168:57.69]It's gone.
[168:57.93]Alright, we did it.
[168:59.03]It's gone.
[168:59.39]Oh.
[169:00.01]What did we get from it?
[169:01.23]Hey.
[169:02.35]Did we get any items at all?
[169:03.57]It sounded like zombie cash.
[169:07.77]It was helpful.
[169:09.57]Oh, behind you, behind you.
[169:13.17]We gotta get out of here!
[169:15.73]Go to the crust of crap.
[169:16.43]Take advantage of the sail.
[169:17.65]Oh, we had a sail, apparently.
[169:19.13]Is there another one?
[169:20.89]I didn't pick it up.
[169:21.53]Sorry, it's yours.
[169:27.02]There's another box somewhere, right?
[169:28.42]Yeah.
[169:28.78]Oh, and the box is here, too.
[169:32.04]I put a lot of work into that box.
[169:33.84]Yeah, alright, so there's that.
[169:35.30]This box should be ready to go.
[169:37.46]What is this?
[169:38.71]I have money.
[169:39.29]I'm gonna buy...
[169:42.18]This looks future.
[169:45.84]Let it reach the box.
[169:47.00]Man, there's, like, nowhere to... Someone should watch the back just in case.
[169:56.81]Oh, yeah.
[169:57.01]We're all facing this way.
[169:58.17]Is that it?
[170:02.48]That's it for now.
[170:05.00]Well, unless there's one, maybe, like, a... Nope, there's a couple more.
[170:08.66]A couple more coming.
[170:09.78]Electricity thing?
[170:12.36]No, I'm gonna get this again.
[170:13.90]I might get it too.
[170:14.60]I don't know what that is.
[170:16.56]Yeah, there it is.
[170:18.14]Sol's complete reward is in the spawn zone.
[170:20.54]Yeah.
[170:21.58]Alright, let's stick together here.
[170:23.60]This is gonna be it.
[170:24.49]This is gonna be our key.
[170:25.97]Our key out of here.
[170:27.83]Is this gonna be one key?
[170:29.05]Oh, or it's gonna be three guns?
[170:31.39]What?
[170:32.37]Three guns?
[170:35.67]I can't wait for this to be what kills me.
[170:37.86]What?
[170:38.02]I'm gonna open this up.
[170:42.23]The round isn't over yet.
[170:43.41]Yeah, there's more people being spawned.
[170:46.75]Oh, they're pack-a-punch guns.
[170:49.11]Okay, they're good, though.
[170:50.17]Yeah.
[170:51.39]These are high-tier guns.
[170:54.70]Alright, we're hiding here today.
[170:56.16]Let's get that fucking key.
[170:59.88]They fucking spawn right on top of us.
[171:01.70]What the fuck?
[171:02.16]We don't have any other options.
[171:10.92]There's a power-up somewhere in there.
[171:13.62]They're all gonna shrink.
[171:14.40]This is a bad idea, man.
[171:18.59]What the fuck?
[171:20.07]Wait, there's infinite ammo.
[171:21.15]I see it.
[171:22.09]We're gods of this realm.
[171:23.11]Hold on.
[171:23.45]Back up.
[171:23.77]Back up a little.
[171:24.45]Back up.
[171:25.11]Okay.
[171:25.43]I got it.
[171:27.35]That was max ammo.
[171:28.81]It's a time warp.
[171:29.35]We're good.
[171:32.31]We're free.
[171:32.65]Man, with this much ammo in the chamber, how can it be?
[171:36.65]Oh, they're spawnin' behind us again.
[171:38.83]Are they?
[171:39.09]I'm gonna head over towards Criken, because I'm too strong now to wait.
[171:44.67]Where is the jug-nog thing?
[171:47.57]Uh, right there.
[171:48.47]Take a left there.
[171:51.29]Nice.
[171:51.93]You just get every time.
[171:52.77]No, Criken, as in here, as in you were taking him up a couple of times, turned around, looked at me.
[172:03.41]Alright, we gotta figure out where this... Oh, you gotta beat this level.
[172:06.73]Alright, let's think.
[172:09.62]Who have we not talked to?
[172:10.66]Who's not giving us a quest?
[172:14.16]Larry's been keeping his mouth shut about something.
[172:18.72]Larry the Lobster?
[172:20.06]Larry looks like he's pointing at something.
[172:21.76]Dude, I just watched you kill a crawler.
[172:23.88]I just watched you run up and kill my crawler.
[172:26.78]Are you talking to me?
[172:27.94]Yeah, I'm talking to you.
[172:29.24]No, you better not be talking to me because I'm... I fucking saw you do it.
[172:31.76]There's no one else here.
[172:32.84]Leave him alone.
[172:34.74]Leave him alone.
[172:35.54]Do you guys have a crawler over there?
[172:37.79]Last one just blew up.
[172:38.59]Do you have a crawler?
[172:39.21]Oh, no, we don't have one.
[172:40.35]Okay, well, there's a running crazed guy over here by me, so leave that guy alive.
[172:45.17]I did not know that that drink spawner was so loud.
[172:50.89]Oh, it's loud, alright.
[172:52.65]Holy shit.
[172:54.19]Where's the pack-a-puncher?
[172:55.03]It's, like, over by the key door, right?
[172:56.25]He's dancing, dude.
[172:59.13]I have 10,000 points.
[173:00.91]I'm going to need more perks.
[173:02.96]I need more drinks.
[173:03.82]Dude, fill up on all the perks, dude.
[173:06.22]I'm on babysit duty right now.
[173:09.70]I can babysit.
[173:10.80]Swap for you.
[173:11.56]Chad, I need you to use your comprehensive lore of Spongebob to explain where the third key probably is.
[173:17.26]Where did Spongebob and Patrick hide the final key?
[173:19.68]Yeah, where did they hide the final key?
[173:22.44]The key of the soul.
[173:23.30]STG44?
[173:23.86]What do you think?
[173:27.03]Try checking garbage cans.
[173:29.03]That's what I thought.
[173:29.99]The garbage cans in this map seem a little bit too high detail to not be hiding in dark.
[173:34.07]No, no, no, no.
[173:36.51]Just get the box.
[173:38.05]Is there a box?
[173:39.87]Davy Jones locker.
[173:41.43]The lid.
[173:43.21]Okay, everyone's saying the lid.
[173:44.56]Alright, I get it.
[173:45.98]You know Spongebob memes.
[173:46.72]The lid?
[173:47.52]AK-47?
[173:54.57]What do you guys think?
[173:55.21]So you guys do puzzle work.
[173:56.35]I'll just babysit this Dutchman for a while.
[174:02.13]Oh, light beam, okay.
[174:06.62]Oh my god.
[174:10.98]The lid, the lid, the lid.
[174:12.96]Everyone's screaming about the lid.
[174:14.28]Everyone's yelling about the lid.
[174:15.14]It must be the lid, guys.
[174:16.58]It's unanimously the lid.
[174:17.68]Oh, the lid.
[174:18.56]The lid.
[174:19.06]Why do we think about that?
[174:21.58]Did they mean, like, sewer vent?
[174:23.16]Like, a lid for, like... Honestly, it could be opening the final door, because we've opened all of them except for the one over here, so... Alright, dude, what just happened?
[174:30.05]Well, I was looking... I was trying to go towards, like, the beam of light, and... Oh.
[174:34.49]Here, just want to come over to me?
[174:36.05]You distracted my zombie.
[174:39.78]What is happening?
[174:40.84]Oh my god.
[174:41.86]The game just hyper lagged.
[174:43.18]I think Jerma needs to go over here.
[174:44.88]Jerma, could you open up this bus, bus, bus, bus?
[174:50.45]I need a new weapon.
[174:52.63]I'm going to power pack a new weapon.
[174:53.93]Okay, once you get that, head straight down this road and buy that thing for me.
[174:58.22]Does the Uzi suck?
[174:59.66]Huh?
[175:00.84]I mean, you could get a better gun for sure from the box.
[175:05.86]I did not miss a dig site.
[175:06.94]I'm looking back.
[175:07.38]We're sort of past the phase where we settle for average, you know?
[175:12.22]Yeah, that's true.
[175:12.98]Sack three?
[175:14.96]That thing looks like a dual wield, which means it shoots pretty fast.
[175:19.19]Probably good pack-a-punched.
[175:20.55]Yeah, let's pack-a-punch this thing up.
[175:22.25]Did you guys figure out how to dive yet?
[175:23.45]Oh, easy, easy.
[175:25.31]You can't afford the pack-a-punch.
[175:26.31]I think they need you to open up a debris hole.
[175:28.86]Yeah, back to the spawn.
[175:30.14]Why does your zombie want to kick your ass so bad?
[175:35.26]I'm just going to run this way for a sec.
[175:38.76]I don't have enough money.
[175:39.44]I will in a minute, though.
[175:40.80]Just like holding this.
[175:42.81]Oh, no.
[175:43.91]Oh, alright.
[175:44.53]Apparently, we missed one.
[175:45.55]Oh, there's the last dig site.
[175:47.43]Maybe.
[175:48.19]Double pack?
[175:48.85]This gun, you can double pack?
[175:50.35]I thought they just gave you more ammo.
[175:53.03]Fuck.
[175:54.73]Nothing?
[175:55.65]Nope.
[175:56.23]Five grand.
[175:57.95]James, does double packing do anything in this or does it just refill your ammo?
[176:03.25]I don't know if they added that in like a later thing.
[176:07.66]All these zombie games merged for me.
[176:09.68]We need to open this door right here.
[176:14.64]You see where I am?
[176:17.60]Yeah, this is the last one we haven't opened.
[176:19.88]That just goes back to the beginning.
[176:21.28]Yeah, but maybe it was... Okay.
[176:22.94]I was hoping it was going to like give us a... You opened all the doors thing.
[176:27.02]Oh.
[176:27.30]Double packing gives special ammo?
[176:28.73]What the fuck?
[176:32.07]Dude, what the fuck?
[176:33.37]Where's SpongeBob hiding his special treasure?
[176:35.73]I don't know, we've kind of... He's pissing me off.
[176:38.75]Oh, we've kind of... Oh, there's another power switch here.
[176:41.17]Oh.
[176:42.41]No, this is for racing stripes.
[176:43.70]Have we exhausted all options?
[176:46.32]Power switch, people are saying.
[176:48.19]I pulled another switch right there.
[176:49.49]We did the power, though.
[176:50.51]It's by the gate.
[176:51.69]No, there's more than one power.
[176:52.85]This one activates only one of the vending machines, though.
[176:55.17]Check the... Maybe we're missing power.
[176:57.61]On the side of every vending machine is its own power.
[177:00.60]Yeah.
[177:01.32]Yeah, that's true.
[177:03.26]And there's one over here as well that's already broken, but I don't... What about Mr. Krabs?
[177:07.36]You can't talk to Mr. Krabs?
[177:09.94]No, Mr. Krabs don't talk.
[177:11.60]He's dead.
[177:12.32]Oh, wait.
[177:14.77]Shoot all the Aquamans.
[177:17.45]Manta Man.
[177:18.09]Manta Man.
[177:18.37]Manta Man.
[177:19.07]You see Manta Man?
[177:21.66]You shoot Manta Man.
[177:22.76]Oh, I see him.
[177:26.24]No, that's just a blue piece of coral.
[177:28.54]The key is in the spawn zone.
[177:30.41]What the fuck?
[177:31.67]Nice job.
[177:35.07]Okay, plug that shit in, James.
[177:39.57]Do I automatically have it?
[177:40.53]I don't have them.
[177:41.23]Oh, I guess you don't.
[177:43.87]Oh, shit.
[177:44.97]We did it.
[177:45.23]We did it.
[177:45.88]What is this?
[177:46.82]Press F.
[177:48.06]50,000.
[177:48.10]We did it.
[177:50.76]Welcome to my game.
[177:52.22]I fucking hate you.
[177:53.38]You're going to have to pay another 50,000 to get this.
[177:55.55]Where are you guys going?
[177:56.53]Where are you guys running?
[177:58.76]What the fuck, dude?
[178:00.24]I guess we'll camp in here.
[178:02.02]50 grand, camp in here.
[178:02.88]Hey, I mean, we all have, like, full pack-a-punch stuff.
[178:06.08]This should be easy.
[178:07.36]Yeah, just try it once and see how fast it goes up.
[178:09.60]Because in this room, like, if we're standing here, they don't spawn in here.
[178:13.33]We just shoot like crazy.
[178:15.55]Yeah, I'll watch behind it and make sure none do spawn in here.
[178:20.35]See if it goes.
[178:21.09]Make sure you guys are prone.
[178:23.29]Extra accuracy.
[178:25.34]Yeah, no, this should be super easy.
[178:26.66]If none spawn back here, this should be like a two-round thing.
[178:34.28]Not two rounds.
[178:35.18]Not two rounds.
[178:35.94]I was thinking more of like if someone got all the kills.
[178:41.33]Yeah, nothing's spawning in here.
[178:42.45]We're good.
[178:45.09]So should one person just shoot every enemy?
[178:47.99]Yeah, that's usually... If we want to make it quick, James should just shoot everything.
[178:51.71]Just shoot every enemy?
[178:53.30]While we just cover it.
[178:55.19]Alright.
[178:55.55]Covering.
[179:00.68]What was that?
[179:02.10]That's the super loud cola machine.
[179:06.42]Which lets me see... Oh, Vulture lets you see every pickup on the map.
[179:11.70]So this is just practice for you.
[179:14.20]Practice for you.
[179:18.22]Almost there.
[179:18.86]I mean, honestly... 10%.
[179:24.25]This is how you actually win co-op Black Ops.
[179:30.93]This is an actual video technically.
[179:35.76]How long is this fun?
[179:36.68]Just watching?
[179:40.10]Next map is going to be KFC.
[179:42.77]So enjoy this while you can, gang.
[179:47.40]I want to throw a grenade, though, because he's like, grenade out.
[179:49.02]Actually, now's a good chance.
[179:50.80]Chats, one for McDonald's, two for KFC, three for Taco Bell.
[179:54.91]Make your decision now while we grind.
[179:56.79]We've got three separate food maps to do.
[180:04.63]Somebody can pack a punch again.
[180:06.12]I'm seeing a lot of threes.
[180:08.82]Blood and glory.
[180:11.58]That's cool.
[180:12.06]What's this dude?
[180:17.53]I hope we get a max ammo out of this or I'm gonna run out of these.
[180:20.55]Then we're gonna be screwed.
[180:23.51]That is so loud.
[180:25.01]Sorry, man.
[180:25.55]I'm getting the last couple of my perks.
[180:26.95]Gotta become unstoppable.
[180:29.33]18.
[180:29.93]Only like four more of those.
[180:32.31]Wait.
[180:32.55]Am I saving up now?
[180:33.93]Yeah.
[180:34.15]You're saving up.
[180:35.18]$50,000.
[180:35.24]I want to see how many I can get.
[180:38.28]Fuck!
[180:40.64]You're our savior, dude.
[180:42.68]You're a money mule now, man.
[180:54.15]Well, it seems just like enough time to run an ad on my channel.
[180:57.51]Thanks guys for watching.
[180:58.61]Oh, I did tell you.
[181:01.09]You just said ads.
[181:03.61]You just said the word ads.
[181:04.69]He did this yesterday.
[181:05.79]He ran like a hundred ads on stream.
[181:08.27]I made so much money.
[181:09.35]No idea.
[181:10.31]Did it work?
[181:11.11]Did it make you... No, it actually was not.
[181:13.59]It wasn't a lot.
[181:17.28]Not enough to warrant all the unfollows I got, so, you know.
[181:21.17]At your own expense.
[181:23.41]Run ads.
[181:26.67]It was easily like a quarter of his stream.
[181:29.33]Oh, what the fuck?
[181:33.75]Career suicide, exactly.
[181:35.15]I made a deal that if someone were to gift me a sub, I would run an ad, so... I made an ad.
[181:42.73]This is not going to be worth it.
[181:43.63]You're going to open that and it's going to just change.
[181:45.49]Oh, no.
[181:45.77]It's going to instantly send us to the gate.
[181:47.69]It's essentially you pay to game over the game.
[181:50.59]Yeah, yeah.
[181:51.67]Yeah, yeah.
[181:52.89]It's going to be credit for the new YouTube channel.
[181:54.97]I can't wait.
[181:57.99]15,000.
[181:58.91]This was an interesting map of straight lines and roads.
[182:05.11]I'm going to run out of ammo.
[182:06.71]I might have to, like, pack a bunch again just so I can get ammo.
[182:09.95]Oh, no.
[182:13.12]You always have to buy to refill.
[182:14.14]That's gonna set us back a whole round.
[182:16.04]I know, I know, but like I have nothing.
[182:20.33]Dude, they're like starting to get to us too.
[182:22.85]Well, I'm not firing at them.
[182:25.35]I'm running out of ammo too, actually.
[182:31.39]You're gonna get to like 42,000 and we're gonna all have no ammo.
[182:45.62]Alright.
[182:46.80]I'm going to piss.
[182:47.56]I'll bear back.
[182:49.50]We work in shifts.
[182:52.50]How has there not been a max ammo yet?
[182:55.94]Jesus.
[182:59.75]We're too far away from them?
[183:02.53]No.
[183:02.73]There's, there's perks popping up.
[183:04.27]There's drops.
[183:05.61]It's just not a good... Not any good ones.
[183:07.97]Alright.
[183:08.33]I am out of ammo.
[183:09.29]So... Fun.
[183:10.73]I'm, I'm running out too.
[183:12.26]I should pack a punch real quick.
[183:14.26]No, don't, don't, don't.
[183:15.92]I have 20.
[183:16.74]No, he should.
[183:17.40]I barely have any ammo either, and Jerma's peeing, man.
[183:20.38]We need ammo.
[183:21.66]No, no, no, no.
[183:23.08]We need ammo.
[183:23.84]Let's do it.
[183:24.30]It's not as much.
[183:25.74]It's not as much.
[183:26.52]It's only 2,500.
[183:26.86]Okay.
[183:31.11]It actually didn't give me any ammo.
[183:32.53]It filled up.
[183:33.37]No.
[183:34.77]It gave me an extra perk.
[183:40.63]I don't know what the fuck that even does for me, but...
[183:44.84]Oh, God.
[183:46.88]When is he coming back?
[183:49.49]I don't know, but I need to Pack-a-Punch now.
[183:51.39]Oh, there, there, there.
[183:53.95]Wait.
[183:54.09]Did we get one?
[183:54.53]I need that.
[183:54.83]I need that.
[183:57.51]Oh, that's a death machine.
[183:58.75]Look at those points, though.
[184:02.01]Oh, look at those points.
[184:06.59]It's kind of weak.
[184:08.05]It's weak compared to... I pack-a-punched this thing and it didn't even give me any ammo.
[184:11.74]We're gonna die here.
[184:13.10]We're gonna die!
[184:15.84]I have no way of helping.
[184:20.44]Oh, please help!
[184:21.52]Help!
[184:21.96]Help!
[184:22.26]Help!
[184:22.68]What's he gonna get back?
[184:24.52]Long P. How long is this fucking P?
[184:29.25]Holy shit!
[184:30.23]He's gonna die!
[184:32.37]He's dead!
[184:32.81]He's dead!
[184:35.58]There's nothing we can do.
[184:37.58]Get him up.
[184:37.94]Maybe you won't notice if you get him up.
[184:39.60]There's no... Dude, there's no ammo.
[184:41.70]Wait, insta-kill, insta-kill, insta-kill.
[184:43.66]Okay.
[184:44.60]Alright, James, kill them all.
[184:45.92]Knife them if you have to.
[184:47.68]Fuck.
[184:49.04]Fucking... What is going on, man?
[184:52.65]You guys should get some ammo or something, like... Yeah, right.
[184:55.71]From where?
[184:57.09]There's no fucking ammo.
[184:58.49]From where, bud?
[184:59.29]Wait, I know, I know, I know.
[185:00.15]I have an idea.
[185:02.59]Fuck.
[185:02.79]If we take a wall...
[185:04.60]item now.
[185:05.20]We can probably switch it to Pack-a-Punch.
[185:08.97]I'm down.
[185:10.49]You're down?
[185:11.09]What do you mean you're down?
[185:12.07]Oh!
[185:12.43]What was that sound?
[185:14.23]Over here.
[185:14.55]I just Pack-a-Punched.
[185:17.81]We need to like make one of them a crawler.
[185:19.96]I have nothing.
[185:21.42]I'm completely out.
[185:22.34]I'm dead.
[185:23.82]No.
[185:24.12]I'm dead.
[185:24.76]No.
[185:25.64]I am completely out of everything that I have in my inventory.
[185:28.16]I have all my ammo back.
[185:28.96]30,000.
[185:30.48]You guys have to fight your way.
[185:33.21]Whoa!
[185:33.49]I'm back!
[185:36.05]Why not?
[185:36.35]You're down.
[185:36.81]What do you mean you're back?
[185:38.67]I can't pick you up, dude.
[185:40.06]I know, I just came back.
[185:40.72]Oh my god, oh my god.
[185:41.60]Your guy, you dying and glitching or whatever, cost me my life!
[185:47.64]What just happened?
[185:48.86]I don't know, but I came here to save your dead fucking body, and I lost all my perks.
[185:54.19]No!
[185:55.97]It's over.
[185:57.05]It's all over.
[185:57.53]It is over.
[185:59.15]Alright, well just tell him that we got it.
[186:01.20]We got the money.
[186:02.48]Alright, tell him he missed the ending.
[186:05.84]Tell him he missed the ending.
[186:08.96]Oh, my God.
[186:09.82]Did we win?
[186:11.72]Yeah.
[186:12.98]It was amazing, dude.
[186:14.54]Spongebob rolls up in his bikini bottom car, and he says, Patrick, we're going to go jelly hunting.
[186:19.76]Do you want to come too?
[186:20.50]And then we all got in the car, and the game crashes, but it was worth it.
[186:25.43]Yeah.
[186:27.86]Did you not see it?
[186:28.90]Were you away?
[186:29.60]I was peeing.
[186:31.26]No, I was gone.
[186:32.40]How long was that pee, dude?
[186:33.80]That was a long fucking... That was a pretty long pee.
[186:36.20]We assumed after a while he just, like, needed to talk to you, stream or whatever, so we were gone.
[186:42.19]You didn't hear me say, I'm gonna go pee?
[186:44.53]No, we heard you say you were gonna go pee, and then it was like 20 minutes, and we were like, he's probably back right now, or he's gone for good, so we... He shouldn't come a little?
[186:53.33]Okay, chat.
[186:57.24]Did you lose?
[186:59.54]No, we won.
[187:00.00]Oh, we won.
[187:01.40]Your chat saw it.
[187:03.00]They can recap.
[187:03.88]I'm sure there's clips.
[187:05.34]Yeah, we won.
[187:06.28]We won.
[187:08.34]Oh, we won.
[187:08.92]We did it.
[187:09.26]It was a good level.
[187:11.84]Well, we did it.
[187:12.20]You guys want to play Taco Bell?
[187:13.28]Taco Bell was a heavy.
[187:14.50]Well, we did it.
[187:17.10]Lots of people were asking for Taco Bell next, I think.
[187:21.04]Okay.
[187:22.54]I still want to do Mario Kart.
[187:23.52]Uh-oh.
[187:25.77]Wow, my microphone went up to 100 from 64 suddenly, and I got a little jumpy.
[187:32.71]Five Nights at Freddy's as well, too.
[187:34.57]I'm fine with anything.
[187:35.51]I mean, I was just thinking, you know.
[187:36.69]I'm down for Mario Kart, Five Nights at Freddy's, or Taco Bell.
[187:40.82]Is the lobby up yet or no?
[187:42.60]No.
[187:43.06]Hang on.
[187:43.46]Did that count as a good map or a joke awful map?
[187:47.10]I would say it's somewhere in the middle.
[187:48.38]I would say it wasn't quite good.
[187:49.40]I've been trying to get a little serious about it.
[187:51.92]Well, would you guys consider that one a shit map?
[187:53.84]Because if we do Taco Bell, that is guaranteed to be the worst you ever played.
[187:57.74]Alright.
[187:58.32]Hold on.
[187:58.62]Wait, wait.
[187:59.24]They lost because I went to go pee and they ran out of ammo?
[188:03.91]I thought I was going to sit there and have them farm for like a few minutes.
[188:10.34]the fuck I mean a mutant deaf and what was that sound you were just doing into my ear oh now you now you're quiet wait what happened I don't know he started making these like gum smacking sounds and like pissed me off and they got really quiet when I called him out gum smacking yeah I was like you wouldn't you'd have to I'll probably do it again
[188:35.92]Yeah, it sounded like that hoove thing you did earlier, Criken, on Outward.
[188:39.78]Like that gross... I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[188:42.82]You know what I'm talking about.
[188:45.02]I went to pee.
[188:47.66]Uh-huh.
[188:48.14]Okay.
[188:51.13]Wait, where am I?
[188:52.41]What is this?
[188:53.25]You're in multiplayer.
[188:55.05]Fuck, I don't get out.
[188:56.55]You're in the game.
[188:58.05]Wait, what?
[188:59.21]You're in, like, the game, Criken.
[189:00.95]I don't want to be here.
[189:04.92]Where's the exit?
[189:06.41]I don't know.
[189:07.57]They really don't.
[189:10.53]I mean, I guess I could host now.
[189:14.69]What?
[189:15.57]If you're trapped in the game.
[189:17.27]That is.
[189:19.14]Are you guys trapped in the lobby?
[189:20.04]You actually have to buy one of these people or else you can't leave.
[189:23.44]Alright.
[189:27.08]Are you hosting or should I?
[189:28.58]You can just host again.
[189:29.61]It's been fine so far.
[189:30.39]Plus, I'm not sure if I've ever been on this team.
[189:32.07]Is it up now?
[189:33.35]It is up now.
[189:36.43]Alright, do you want Five Nights at Freddy's?
[189:38.87]Might be shit.
[189:40.07]Game of Thrones is also a thing we have to do.
[189:42.73]Yeah, okay.
[189:43.35]We'll bang them out quick.
[189:44.55]We got... Wait, I don't see it.
[189:46.63]What the hell?
[189:48.39]Let's do... Taco Bell, Five Nights at Freddy's.
[189:51.26]There's Super Mario 64 Zombies, which looks better than the other time we did that.
[189:56.16]And then there's... Oh, there it goes.
[189:59.46]I want to do...
[190:03.27]Dude, there's a lot of extra Minecraft levels.
[190:05.23]I think we wrote off Minecraft too soon.
[190:07.05]I got like eight of those in there.
[190:08.86]I think we wrote it off too quick at the beginning because people weren't ready.
[190:12.60]But there's a lot of Minecraft in there.
[190:15.88]There's also Simpsons.
[190:16.92]There's Saw still.
[190:19.68]Saw is so good.
[190:20.66]They must have fucking made a Simpsons level.
[190:23.00]There is.
[190:23.68]I mean, I got it in the past.
[190:25.58]Do you think I missed something?
[190:27.85]No, I got everything, bud.
[190:29.13]I went through almost every page of the fucking... I believe it.
[190:33.43]I downloaded all of them.
[190:35.11]And it took me two hours.
[190:37.25]Hey, I mean, you can't fault me.
[190:38.91]I put effort into picking these out to some extent, okay?
[190:45.06]Okay.
[190:45.76]Saw 3, the final chapter.
[190:47.24]I guarantee you will be good times.
[190:50.14]I can't guarantee that.
[190:51.72]I don't think it's even made by the same guy who made the good Saw levels.
[190:54.64]This might have been a shit one I snuck in to trap you.
[190:58.15]Yeah, this might have been my Saw trap of the night.
[191:00.53]There's Saw 1, there's Saw 2, there's Saw 3, the final chapter, and then there's Jigsaw.
[191:05.49]We're playing Saw through the final chapter.
[191:07.56]There's a lot of chapters.
[191:09.10]They really love Saw.
[191:10.28]There's like 18 Saw movies, to be fair.
[191:12.48]Jigsaw is the latest one, though, right?
[191:14.74]Yeah, you're right.
[191:15.22]You're right.
[191:16.33]Maybe, you're right, it might be the, you know, the freshest.
[191:18.99]Well, that one, that jigsaw was made in like 2017, so probably operating a different rule set on that one.
[191:27.84]There is definitely a couple of traps, like my own saw sort of traps that I've put in this mod pack, because I wasn't, I mean, I guess they are officially traps now because you're the host, but there are ones that are deceptively.
[191:39.63]Can I just join off you or the lobby's private or can we just join off you?
[191:43.07]You should be in it.
[191:43.67]I said you were in it.
[191:44.25]Yeah, I just wanted to be for the future.
[191:46.79]Lack of titties, man.
[191:48.46]You want tits that bad?
[191:49.58]I can get one.
[191:50.70]You want me?
[191:51.16]Hang on, I'll get one.
[191:51.94]I can get one.
[191:52.68]Fuck.
[191:53.50]Alright, Jesus.
[191:55.08]Give me like 10 secs.
[191:58.30]There is also a mod that makes everyone Kermit.
[192:00.98]Is that your thing, too?
[192:02.22]You want me to pander to James now?
[192:05.04]I feel like I've experienced that already.
[192:08.21]Okay, then, uh... What the fuck is this?
[192:10.52]Little do they know, this is like, yeah, the final chapter.
[192:12.38]There's like eight more of these.
[192:14.04]What?
[192:14.22]We played one of these, guys.
[192:15.56]This guy's maps before Killjoy.
[192:17.44]Oh, you're right.
[192:19.18]That was Candyland.
[192:19.98]Yep, this is the trap.
[192:21.42]I fooled you all.
[192:24.62]Ah, yes!
[192:24.86]Welcome to my dungeon.
[192:26.74]This was a mistake.
[192:29.56]What is our knife?
[192:33.54]Spam click.
[192:34.50]I don't think we get... Oh, we got a lot of money.
[192:37.71]Yeah, we all have $660.
[192:38.35]This is like an actual level, guys.
[192:40.41]So, um, you know.
[192:42.33]Last chance.
[192:43.41]This is not like any of the other maps we've done.
[192:46.21]Hey, come down here.
[192:49.53]I hear Jigsaw.
[192:50.45]You cannot walk up the ladder.
[192:52.77]Is there a reason behind the ladder?
[192:54.77]I can't go up the ladder.
[192:56.31]I swear to God.
[192:57.81]Okay, on camera, you came over.
[193:00.83]I swear to God.
[193:01.75]I don't believe you.
[193:04.35]Go look back at my phone.
[193:05.69]Open my phone.
[193:07.70]There he is.
[193:09.32]Okay.
[193:09.58]Do we- who, who?
[193:10.32]I'm gonna go.
[193:12.04]Yeah, I'm gonna go.
[193:13.98]Okay, there's saws on the- I wouldn't touch the saws.
[193:15.84]Wait, what's gonna happen?
[193:16.40]What's gonna happen?
[193:18.34]What's this music?
[193:20.56]Hang on, there's like a- there's something on the wall there.
[193:22.76]There's a gun.
[193:24.23]Crank it, check on the glass.
[193:25.49]See that?
[193:25.85]Does that do anything?
[193:29.63]It's like puzzles, dude.
[193:31.40]No.
[193:32.46]Dude, I love puzzles.
[193:33.28]Is there a person in here that we have to save or would we make a choice?
[193:36.36]I feel like it would be a puzzle if this thing was moving towards us.
[193:39.06]Hang on, I got a plan.
[193:41.29]I'm going to put my head in this saw and we're going to see if it activates something when I pour blood into the machine.
[193:52.73]That was it.
[193:55.11]Don't get me up.
[193:55.75]I'm still in the saws.
[193:57.93]Ah!
[193:58.64]Ah!
[193:59.52]I don't think we're going to be able to get him.
[194:02.08]Can we get him?
[194:03.70]Yeah.
[194:04.06]There you go.
[194:06.54]Oh, oh, oh.
[194:07.06]Did you open that glass?
[194:08.81]Did you shoot it?
[194:10.33]No.
[194:10.87]I mean, I've been shooting it, but, like, it doesn't do anything.
[194:13.43]They probably gave us guns.
[194:14.15]Look at how much money they gave us.
[194:15.63]We need these.
[194:16.25]Yeah.
[194:18.11]What about the guns?
[194:20.68]Nothing to shoot.
[194:21.44]Gun on the wall, yeah.
[194:22.40]We'll just have the guns, I guess.
[194:25.32]Oh, wait.
[194:26.02]I shot him.
[194:28.99]I shot his face.
[194:29.79]Wait, listen.
[194:30.43]Ew, it cut out.
[194:30.91]Okay.
[194:31.13]Oh, what's the door?
[194:32.57]The door's open.
[194:34.45]Let me through, let me through, man.
[194:37.50]I can look out behind you, bud.
[194:58.40]Whoa!
[194:59.92]Saw usually gives you at least a few seconds to figure out what you want to do.
[195:03.24]Dude, get up.
[195:04.88]Dude, I got you.
[195:05.72]I got both of you.
[195:06.68]Crawl out of that saw.
[195:08.40]I can't crawl past this.
[195:10.92]Crawl.
[195:11.30]Come towards me.
[195:12.06]You have four seconds.
[195:13.16]I don't know how everyone died but me.
[195:17.94]There's no zombies in this map.
[195:20.30]It's just trash.
[195:21.68]We're the zombies in Saw.
[195:24.62]Drink this.
[195:25.12]It's like a cola power-up.
[195:27.02]Ooh.
[195:28.12]What?
[195:30.57]You play my game and you fail.
[195:32.39]That's not even a game.
[195:33.35]It's just the guy put like a poison drink here.
[195:35.39]What is the game?
[195:36.67]I'm fucking stuck between you guys now.
[195:38.77]There is no game.
[195:39.75]This is a double trap.
[195:40.91]What the fuck?
[195:41.61]If he was holding two, it would be like a drink the poison game.
[195:46.38]Keep going.
[195:46.68]We gotta shoot something in there.
[195:54.33]Aw, man, four people really clogs up these halls in Saw.
[196:00.03]I'm having a lot of trouble navigating your trapstreak, Saw.
[196:04.26]We have to shoot something in there?
[196:09.00]Oh, I see something.
[196:14.20]Man, I love Saw, dude.
[196:16.39]Wait, how do you turn on your flashlight?
[196:18.29]Double tap F. Okay.
[196:23.80]Okay, I'm trying to double tap.
[196:26.19]You drank it.
[196:28.81]Pull me one.
[196:29.51]Double tap drink.
[196:33.94]I bet we just have to shoot something dumb.
[196:36.42]Yeah.
[196:36.72]What the fuck?
[196:37.91]Alright, light them up.
[196:39.94]Light up everything.
[196:40.68]We got a new TV.
[196:41.90]Hello, we're here.
[196:42.74]It's not an actual cell phone.
[196:43.66]It sounds higher sounding.
[197:06.07]I want to play a game.
[197:07.87]Oh, he changed back.
[197:09.77]Oh, that was the guy.
[197:10.97]Oh, why does he keep doing it?
[197:12.77]Damn it.
[197:13.19]It's because we keep walking back in the room.
[197:14.83]I want to play a game.
[197:16.99]Wait, did someone click E on it?
[197:19.44]I think that's it.
[197:20.48]Damn it.
[197:21.12]Alright, no one move, no one move.
[197:23.82]Ow!
[197:23.88]He's dead!
[197:25.52]Wait, who's hurting us?
[197:27.64]What is fucking dead, dude?
[197:29.86]What is happening?
[197:30.72]Jesus fucking dead.
[197:32.64]What is happening?
[197:34.86]What happened to him?
[197:38.81]Shoot him down.
[197:40.49]He doesn't deserve this.
[197:41.53]Wait, we have to find out what the game is.
[197:43.81]This is writing on the wall.
[197:45.75]Alright, the blood surely doesn't hurt you.
[197:47.67]I'm okay.
[197:49.05]Is anyone a hacker?
[197:49.95]I need a hacker over here.
[197:51.49]Don't touch the blood.
[197:52.48]Don't touch the blood.
[197:54.74]James.
[197:56.86]Do you know how to hack?
[197:58.70]No, I don't have anything.
[198:00.02]Come over here and check.
[198:03.64]I won't even know how to hack.
[198:07.25]I'm not fucking around.
[198:08.49]No, he does need a hack.
[198:10.77]It doesn't work.
[198:12.29]We need to learn how to hack real quick, guys.
[198:14.89]Okay, maybe in that box is the secret to hack.
[198:17.01]Oh, what's that?
[198:17.99]I heard a voice start.
[198:18.57]He's talking.
[198:21.35]Alright, as soon as he starts talking, nobody move and let him finish his sentence because he gets spooked if we're moving too much.
[198:26.50]He's drunk.
[198:29.76]Oh, wait.
[198:30.98]I heard him again.
[198:31.82]Go shoot this.
[198:32.90]Yeah, that's what I was just shooting at.
[198:34.98]Not doing anything.
[198:36.50]He's shy, guys.
[198:38.12]Wait a minute.
[198:39.36]Nobody move.
[198:41.08]Nobody move.
[198:49.27]I didn't even hear anything!
[198:50.47]Stop!
[198:51.08]Don't move!
[198:52.40]I can hear you!
[198:54.42]What the fuck is happening?
[198:56.00]Just let him tell us!
[198:58.44]Okay.
[199:05.60]However, this next challenge will test your ability to adapt to your surroundings.
[199:11.66]He's literally talking to just them.
[199:14.10]Wait, he just repeats himself.
[199:15.84]Okay.
[199:16.46]Wait, so you two got to talk to Jigsaw.
[199:18.20]I didn't.
[199:18.76]Wait, I shot a bear in the fire, and it did something.
[199:22.00]It disappeared.
[199:22.60]Did you learn how to hack?
[199:23.66]It said get used to your surroundings.
[199:26.14]We need Jigsaw's key for this room.
[199:28.00]I'm okay with your dying if I get to live.
[199:31.01]Weird that he decided he was too lazy to write two.
[199:34.17]Did Jigsaw have a knee brace in the movies?
[199:36.23]I don't understand.
[199:37.63]Yeah, dude.
[199:38.31]Did you see the last one that got crippled?
[199:40.37]It was real sad.
[199:41.05]Okay, Owen, if you stand next to this... Guys, if you couldn't hear Jigsaw, stand next to this walkie-talkie.
[199:48.15]That's when you can hear him.
[199:50.17]But what does he say?
[199:51.65]Does he say anything new?
[199:52.49]If you run past him... Am I doomed?
[199:57.09]There's a button on the ceiling.
[200:00.85]You see his ass if you keep running past it.
[200:02.81]Button on the ceiling.
[200:03.37]Asshole.
[200:03.93]Button on the ceiling.
[200:05.37]Asshole.
[200:06.80]Asshole.
[200:07.26]Mine's actually not bugging out.
[200:08.48]I can hear it.
[200:09.34]The whole thing.
[200:14.45]Test our ability to adapt to our surroundings.
[200:16.41]I think two of us have to go in here and die?
[200:19.98]That doesn't seem... I don't think Jigsaw... I mean, I guess he does, like... Well, it says two die, so... Oh, oh.
[200:27.12]No, no.
[200:27.44]Two... If I get... If I live, get to... No.
[200:30.32]I'm okay with your dying if I get to live.
[200:32.00]It's got nothing to do with... Wait.
[200:34.90]Okay.
[200:35.28]There's actually no... There's no clue in his dialogue clips.
[200:40.31]Stop.
[200:40.93]I can't... Get out of the blood.
[200:43.01]I can't get out of the blood.
[200:45.59]Okay.
[200:46.11]Guys, we gotta adapt to our surroundings.
[200:49.07]Okay.
[200:50.14]I know not to jump into the pool of blood, which means I've adapted to my surroundings.
[200:54.96]Red is dead.
[200:56.43]Red is dead.
[200:59.13]So what do I do now?
[201:01.93]There's that door.
[201:04.35]Has anyone learned how to hack?
[201:05.61]Have we adapted into hacking?
[201:07.53]No hacking.
[201:08.59]What about over here?
[201:09.73]Key.
[201:12.75]Throw nade into box.
[201:14.77]Oh.
[201:16.07]Smart chat.
[201:16.55]Let's try.
[201:22.79]Uh-huh.
[201:23.75]Uh-huh.
[201:24.81]Okay.
[201:25.69]What about in here?
[201:26.85]What about in the fireplace?
[201:28.71]Okay.
[201:28.93]They're going to need a fireplace.
[201:32.15]No.
[201:34.67]As I'm sure you have realized.
[201:39.62]What do I get?
[201:40.14]There's three lab coats?
[201:41.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[201:44.28]Wait.
[201:44.72]Did I turn my flashlight on?
[201:46.04]I mean, this button surely is a thing.
[201:47.56]What happened to my flashlight?
[201:48.60]There's an arrow pointing at it.
[201:50.91]There it goes.
[201:51.99]Are we not like... What if you parkour with these pillars?
[201:54.67]Yeah, I'm trying to get on this.
[201:55.79]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[201:57.29]Okay.
[201:59.41]I'm not sure you can.
[202:00.99]No, maybe not.
[202:03.51]I mean, he's... Maybe there's something you need to interact with inside this box.
[202:06.42]No, you can do it.
[202:08.14]I'm jumping on these.
[202:09.66]There you go.
[202:10.10]I was thinking about hitting the... Oh, you can jump.
[202:12.14]Hang on.
[202:12.44]You can definitely parkour these.
[202:14.56]Yeah.
[202:15.34]I mean, yeah, you could.
[202:16.30]Oh, and then you get in the box.
[202:17.70]You can totally jump to this and then into the box.
[202:19.70]Okay, okay.
[202:20.00]Yeah.
[202:24.49]Alright, you ready, guys?
[202:25.91]There you go.
[202:27.79]Oh, you're in.
[202:28.19]Hey!
[202:29.65]I did it!
[202:32.15]Ow!
[202:32.31]And we hacked the door open.
[202:33.61]Come on, guys.
[202:34.97]Wait.
[202:35.75]Wait.
[202:35.93]Did we get you?
[202:36.73]We have to leave.
[202:38.07]You're the one that needs to die.
[202:39.47]That's what it says on the wall.
[202:40.33]That's right.
[202:40.95]I made it.
[202:41.39]It says it on the wall.
[202:42.33]Go through there, too, while you're dead.
[202:44.55]Okay.
[202:44.71]Alright, now pick me up.
[202:49.79]Okay.
[202:50.25]I'll go in next.
[202:52.76]Now pick me up.
[202:54.10]Now pick me up.
[202:55.00]Thanks.
[202:56.10]What the fuck is this?
[202:56.97]What the fuck are you guys?
[202:59.21]Now you come through.
[203:00.55]Now you come through.
[203:01.73]We're all through now.
[203:03.99]Every time I revive, I'm going to die from these.
[203:06.55]I'm not going to be able to get through.
[203:10.02]Okay, James, come through.
[203:11.58]We've got to be pretty fast.
[203:13.14]Yeah, come through.
[203:13.64]I'll catch you.
[203:18.97]Okay, just let me through.
[203:23.51]I'll just get picked up on the other side.
[203:25.83]Dude, I'm just gonna, I'll see you on this.
[203:27.05]Let me go.
[203:27.39]Let me go.
[203:36.83]Was that supposed to hit me?
[203:40.00]Oh, shit!
[203:43.08]It wasn't even in the right place.
[203:44.88]Alright, so that... Wait, hold on.
[203:46.30]Anything on the right side here?
[203:47.76]There's some stuff over here.
[203:50.12]Gas!
[203:50.50]Oh, wait, wait.
[203:51.42]She just had it.
[203:52.87]Oh, wait, that's a different one.
[203:54.95]Oh.
[203:55.37]It looks like it.
[203:56.31]Alright, follow me.
[203:57.45]Help.
[203:57.61]Oh, I see it.
[204:07.26]This is another parkour thing.
[204:08.52]Okay, some sort of jump thing.
[204:10.10]Yeah.
[204:10.52]You fall and you gotta climb back up.
[204:12.34]Well... Oh, there... Is it just poison, actually?
[204:20.69]It's just sliding benches.
[204:23.77]Wait, they don't move with you.
[204:25.45]You gotta move with it.
[204:26.77]That's awkward.
[204:31.03]Oh, this is, this is, I remember this part in Saw 5.
[204:33.77]I remember they park, I remember they parkored from mattress to mattress.
[204:41.69]Oh, that one looks so bad.
[204:43.05]Is it even going to make it back in time for me?
[204:44.79]Where am I going?
[204:46.23]There's a door.
[204:47.19]There's a door, there's a door right there next to you.
[204:49.68]I can't see it, man.
[204:51.88]Can you just like swim to it?
[204:53.92]No, there's, I mean, hang on, let me see.
[204:59.41]No.
[205:00.25]No, you cannot.
[205:01.68]You gotta do it.
[205:03.70]You gotta do it for real.
[205:07.70]What level was it that this guy made that we played before?
[205:10.44]Candyland.
[205:11.49]I mean, you gotta give the guy some credit.
[205:14.31]He really covers every genre with his levels.
[205:17.73]I think he also made the game with those levels.
[205:20.09]Oh, God, really?
[205:20.87]Wait.
[205:21.77]Whoa, whoa!
[205:23.45]What the fuck just happened?
[205:24.95]You gotta jump.
[205:25.71]You gotta jump from that one to that one.
[205:26.97]It wasn't there for me.
[205:28.03]No!
[205:29.97]This is never going to happen.
[205:31.15]This is so hard.
[205:31.67]This is awful.
[205:32.35]No, we can totally do this.
[205:33.81]This is not bad.
[205:34.37]This is like a Mario deal.
[205:36.38]Hey, Criken, if you go into console, can you noclip?
[205:42.96]It recognizes the command.
[205:44.66]Can you wall run?
[205:45.54]That's gonna hurt.
[205:46.76]Oh, yeah, wall running.
[205:48.72]Can you walk on that?
[205:50.38]That's not a thing on this map.
[205:51.90]No, it's not.
[205:54.02]I guess not.
[205:54.50]I'm getting sick of getting dunked by all this water.
[206:00.32]Where's the other?
[206:01.64]What?
[206:02.97]Yeah, it's like the timing's off now.
[206:07.13]I'm going to get there.
[206:07.65]God damn it.
[206:07.93]You got to wait for the person to completely fall before you even get on the next one or else the pattern is off.
[206:18.42]I'm just gonna drown.
[206:19.00]What?
[206:19.38]Oh my god, it's like buggy, man.
[206:20.89]It's like I'm falling off.
[206:22.37]Yeah, it's odd.
[206:23.19]You press forward, and sometimes it's very weird.
[206:25.75]Sometimes you get stuck, and then you jerk off.
[206:27.47]Maybe because I'm host, it's not that bad for me, but... I mean, as soon as you get through this... Damn it!
[206:35.25]Now I'm too deep in.
[206:36.71]I want to know.
[206:37.71]I want to know what happens next.
[206:39.15]I want to hear more of what happens in the final chapter.
[206:41.84]It's like you move slower than the thing moves, so you have to like preemptively move.
[206:45.64]You know what might be easier?
[206:46.68]I bet if maybe you bunny hop.
[206:48.60]Oh, God.
[206:49.32]Wait.
[206:50.90]You guys got to jitter step.
[206:53.04]Here.
[206:53.78]If you walk, that's how I do it.
[206:54.74]Here.
[206:55.28]It's not that bad.
[206:57.08]God, look at him.
[206:57.64]He just cut in front of me.
[206:58.62]He just cut in front of me.
[206:59.78]I'm showing you.
[207:00.96]He's like the greatest Call of Duty gamer I've ever seen.
[207:04.03]Where's the door?
[207:05.25]Keep going.
[207:05.77]No, nope.
[207:07.85]It's like way over there.
[207:09.91]Now it's got to reset all the way.
[207:11.83]Okay, I'm going to get it this time.
[207:16.36]I believe in you.
[207:24.01]Well, that's going to be a long reset.
[207:28.17]Give it a minute.
[207:29.11]It's not going to be back in time.
[207:32.49]Thanks, Criken.
[207:34.47]I think it might be client side because it was reset for me.
[207:37.78]Oh, was it?
[207:38.58]Check under the water.
[207:40.08]Bugs.
[207:40.60]Oh, man.
[207:41.04]Yeah, I don't even think my connection is good enough to do that.
[207:44.00]I'm running on like over 120 ping.
[207:47.62]So I think I just watch.
[207:49.08]I'll hang out.
[207:51.19]Don't look at chat.
[207:52.05]No, what the fuck?
[207:53.03]No, Crankit, if you actually, next to one, the tilde key actually does open the real console and it recognizes noclip as a command.
[207:59.51]I don't have any, no, I just turned off my fucking flashlight again.
[208:03.71]Try typing SV cheats.
[208:06.49]It's not SV though, is it?
[208:08.65]It actually recognizes SV.
[208:13.23]Does the knife make you run it faster in this game?
[208:15.88]Oh my God.
[208:17.14]It activated the platform too.
[208:19.08]Oh guys, take out your knives, take out your knives.
[208:22.88]What does that do?
[208:23.74]You run faster.
[208:25.34]This is just like, sir.
[208:26.52]You can keep up with it.
[208:29.90]Sorry, James, I'm cutting you.
[208:31.26]You fucking cut me.
[208:32.34]I just cut you.
[208:33.70]Ha!
[208:34.48]I did it!
[208:35.76]I can do this!
[208:36.92]You're upstairs.
[208:38.24]Oh, no!
[208:39.78]Hey, tomato.
[208:40.94]What happened to you?
[208:43.04]The poison.
[208:43.96]You drowned.
[208:45.60]Yeah, the knife definitely makes it easier.
[208:49.70]Alright, go for it.
[208:50.98]You got it.
[208:52.93]No!
[208:54.51]I think it's... I think sometimes just get lucky and the platform doesn't fuck you.
[208:59.46]Mine's still sitting there.
[209:02.30]Oh, you got it.
[209:03.38]You got it.
[209:03.82]There you go.
[209:06.74]There you go.
[209:09.22]What's the end goal?
[209:10.74]When you reach the middle of that wall is when it stops.
[209:14.41]Right under the P is the door.
[209:16.75]You gotta jump at the P. Oh, okay.
[209:18.73]I see.
[209:20.59]I might get this.
[209:21.93]I see it now.
[209:26.09]Fuck.
[209:26.61]I jumped too early.
[209:29.19]Wait, if it's under the P, what's the point of that platform under the yellow flag?
[209:34.18]I think that might be what you need to jump to, actually.
[209:36.98]Really?
[209:37.24]I think that one is the one that goes towards it.
[209:40.90]Oh, really?
[209:41.62]Yeah, I feel like if you jump off from the second platform, you're just going to slip through.
[209:47.51]Look, look, I'll activate it.
[209:49.11]Let me see if it does anything.
[209:50.79]Is it moving?
[209:52.89]Or I'm dying.
[209:53.73]Hop!
[209:54.77]Okay, I died.
[209:55.57]Tomatoes got it.
[209:57.55]I died already.
[209:59.13]Jump.
[209:59.77]Nice.
[210:01.69]Where's it taking me?
[210:02.73]It didn't move.
[210:05.43]I don't even know if that's going to do anything.
[210:07.71]I thought it would move and it never did.
[210:09.51]You have to jump from there into the... Hey!
[210:13.44]Crawl up to here.
[210:15.04]What?
[210:15.28]It doesn't look like you're losing time.
[210:16.74]Hang on, I got you.
[210:20.78]The thing's gonna come back.
[210:21.46]Come on, come back.
[210:21.92]Alright, here we go.
[210:23.22]Alright, so the last one doesn't move.
[210:26.12]I'm not sure exactly what it's supposed to do.
[210:27.42]It should move.
[210:28.04]It moved when I was in the wad.
[210:31.26]Maybe I needed to be on it for longer, but I panicked.
[210:33.48]Maybe it gives you a second to stand on it before it moves.
[210:36.07]It definitely should move unless it's broken.
[210:40.99]I love Saw.
[210:47.77]What a jump.
[210:49.39]Gonna be here in a while.
[210:52.27]Is it in the middle for you?
[210:53.64]This is the rest of the game.
[210:59.03]I'll get him.
[210:59.39]Someone else go.
[211:04.84]Alright, you hear us there?
[211:05.90]Look, it moves!
[211:06.64]You got it?
[211:07.76]It is moving.
[211:08.70]Why is it moving now?
[211:10.46]God, what?
[211:11.00]Who started it?
[211:12.28]I shot it.
[211:13.42]What?
[211:13.72]I shot it.
[211:14.65]I shot it.
[211:16.35]Yeah.
[211:16.79]Oh, maybe someone else has to do it the rest of the way, or you got to shoot it yourself.
[211:19.79]This is like a Mario Maker level.
[211:21.17]Only one guy was able to do this.
[211:22.73]It was a person that created it.
[211:26.21]Can someone go up this ladder?
[211:27.73]I'm dying of poison, dude.
[211:30.59]Alright, James, you want to do it?
[211:31.67]I'll shoot the thing when you're ready.
[211:33.61]If I can even make it up there.
[211:34.87]Now jump.
[211:37.97]Why?
[211:38.66]I think I'm getting decisively better at the second one now.
[211:42.70]Fuck, I can't even make it to the second one.
[211:45.71]I know, I feel so inadequate.
[211:48.61]I can't even get up the fucking ladder.
[211:50.71]You think you got this?
[211:51.39]What the fuck?
[211:54.47]I believe in you.
[211:56.17]Holy shit, dude.
[211:57.25]Imagine how satisfying the chaos is going to be, though, after this.
[212:00.43]I shouldn't.
[212:01.71]I think I can do this.
[212:02.43]I didn't sprint that time.
[212:03.53]You got it.
[212:04.03]You got it.
[212:04.89]I think I can actually do this.
[212:07.75]I've been getting better.
[212:17.28]Does somebody need to shoot it?
[212:19.38]Don't shoot it yet.
[212:19.96]Do not shoot it yet.
[212:20.78]We did it.
[212:21.62]It's okay.
[212:22.44]We missed.
[212:23.14]It's okay.
[212:24.58]We missed.
[212:27.30]Why is it not moving?
[212:28.50]It's not working now.
[212:30.73]Someone swim under it?
[212:32.29]Yeah.
[212:34.47]I shot it before and it worked.
[212:36.25]It was moving.
[212:38.05]Go, go, go, go.
[212:40.51]It's not moving.
[212:43.01]Did we fuck it up?
[212:45.38]I can't make that jump from here.
[212:46.58]It's alright.
[212:46.96]Just stay there.
[212:47.82]I'm out of ammo.
[212:48.68]Hold on.
[212:48.94]I'll come get you.
[212:49.70]We'll figure it out.
[212:50.44]It's going to move, and then I'm not going to notice I'm going to fall off.
[212:53.74]I'll start yelling as soon as it starts moving.
[212:59.26]Ow.
[213:02.10]Wait.
[213:02.28]Are you dead up there?
[213:02.89]Oh.
[213:05.03]You're dead under.
[213:07.33]There was a lion at the ladder.
[213:11.21]I can't even look around right now.
[213:12.99]I'm going to stare at this thing.
[213:15.86]I wonder how the fuck it moved before.
[213:19.28]Is there a button maybe that we press?
[213:21.03]Wait, try shooting it when I jump.
[213:22.67]Like when I'm not touching it.
[213:23.53]I don't have any more ammo.
[213:27.71]Yeah, I'm out of ammo too.
[213:31.73]I shot it when I was in the air and it didn't move.
[213:35.29]What the fuck?
[213:36.79]Maybe a grenade?
[213:38.91]Oh, what happened there?
[213:39.73]I got stuck on the lip.
[213:42.80]I'm going to lose my mind here.
[213:44.67]Tell him to jump and shoot it.
[213:45.65]Yeah, if you jump up and shoot below you.
[213:46.86]I did that.
[213:47.10]That's what I did.
[213:47.80]I'm doing that right now.
[213:50.34]I'm out of ammo now.
[213:50.94]I'm going to die.
[213:51.66]You know what?
[213:52.92]Fuck it.
[213:53.42]I'm going for it.
[213:55.12]I didn't.
[213:56.68]Broken map.
[213:57.82]Broken map.
[213:58.34]Map sucks, man.
[213:59.50]I hate this.
[214:03.50]We gotta be missing something, but... I mean, I don't know what we're missing.
[214:06.58]It feels like, uh... Wait, let me... I... I guess I can try to create the same circumstances.
[214:12.08]I was underwater and I died.
[214:13.90]Okay, dude, you can hit the fucking flag.
[214:16.16]The giant, like, drape.
[214:17.88]Red box at corner, someone said.
[214:19.54]Is that what we... Do we shoot that?
[214:21.64]And that starts it?
[214:23.68]I'm out of ammo.
[214:25.33]Does anybody have any ammo?
[214:26.95]Yeah, someone shoot this.
[214:28.83]Oh, okay.
[214:29.53]Alright, there we go.
[214:30.37]That moved it.
[214:31.17]We figured it out.
[214:32.61]Wait, what did you do?
[214:33.47]Shoot the box?
[214:34.41]You can shoot the box in the corner.
[214:36.17]I'll go get those two while I, like, pressure my... Oh, shit.
[214:40.10]Oh, God.
[214:40.58]Oh, God.
[214:40.94]Oh, God.
[214:41.28]Oh, God.
[214:41.58]Oh, God.
[214:41.78]I'm coming.
[214:42.26]Oh, my God.
[214:44.48]Okay.
[214:44.88]I'm gonna do this, boys.
[214:46.72]I'm gonna pull it off.
[214:49.50]You're like an angel.
[214:50.86]I'm alive.
[214:52.32]Poison angel.
[214:54.70]Okay, I'm in position.
[214:56.78]Oh, my God.
[214:57.90]He's in position.
[214:58.48]Someone shoot it.
[214:59.74]Wait, I'll just go get it.
[215:00.67]We have no ammo.
[215:02.11]Nobody has any ammo in their guns.
[215:05.39]Can I splash it?
[215:06.79]I'm just going to go slash the damn thing.
[215:09.23]Ready?
[215:09.45]Go, go.
[215:13.37]It's like passing.
[215:14.07]I gotta like do it in mid-move.
[215:17.19]That is so hard.
[215:18.07]You can't get any momentum.
[215:21.25]I could do it, but it's like I gotta like... That's hard, man.
[215:24.59]That's real hard.
[215:25.53]The thing is, if we all have to do that, it's not gonna happen.
[215:29.53]No way.
[215:31.15]While I'm down, I can get it.
[215:32.77]Oh, am I at it?
[215:34.25]You're at it.
[215:35.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[215:36.66]I'm afraid.
[215:39.19]Remember get get at the end of it as far away from doors.
[215:42.95]You can't even have to sprint jump into it.
[215:44.73]Go go No, you fucking didn't tell me!
[215:49.22]I did say go!
[215:50.96]It wasn't moving that fast!
[215:52.32]Can we play it soft too?
[215:55.20]Let's go back.
[215:55.90]The second movie's better.
[215:58.68]No, let's do Jigsaw, the newest
[216:02.75]I mean, like, I know I can do this.
[216:04.61]And I feel like this is, I feel like this sounds like some sort of shortcut system.
[216:09.43]Where's my light?
[216:10.19]Is someone next to me?
[216:15.26]Nope.
[216:16.06]Nope.
[216:16.46]Okay.
[216:20.00]This is like Satan levels.
[216:21.14]Just let me die here.
[216:27.51]Okay.
[216:28.01]We're going back.
[216:28.39]I'm not going to let you die.
[216:29.45]No.
[216:32.24]Game over.
[216:32.84]Play again?
[216:34.92]Wait, what?
[216:36.76]Wait!
[216:38.96]Was there a pathway underwater?
[216:41.16]No, there wasn't.
[216:41.76]It's just the reflection.
[216:42.52]I thought so too.
[216:47.82]Hey, I mean, cool level.
[216:48.78]Saw traps.
[216:50.10]So, do we want to try more saw levels?
[216:51.84]Because they're all like this.
[216:52.76]They're all like not actually... And there it goes.
[216:56.45]Mine didn't crash.
[216:59.29]I'm good.
[217:00.15]You're so lucky to not have crashes.
[217:02.71]We have Friday Nights at Freddy's four, I mean two, I mean one.
[217:06.21]Game of Thrones.
[217:07.23]We have Game of Thrones.
[217:08.51]KFC.
[217:09.61]KFC.
[217:11.63]What's wrong with KFC?
[217:14.30]What did people vote for for the fast food one?
[217:16.22]Taco Bell.
[217:17.14]How do I enable cheat?
[217:21.14]I don't know.
[217:25.18]What the hell?
[217:26.70]Someone in chat might know.
[217:28.66]And today for school lunch, steakums.
[217:32.12]That's what it sounds like.
[217:35.88]I tried to catch it too.
[217:37.48]I was like on the slider already.
[217:44.05]I mean, I would, I also think we're due for another actual good map.
[217:49.89]Yeah.
[217:52.33]I'm not sure if that's the good one, bud.
[217:55.26]Matter of fact, that might be made by one of our favorite meme creators.
[218:00.87]Is it Killjoy again?
[218:02.05]Possibly Killjoy again.
[218:05.23]I remember Killjoy having a lot of levels.
[218:08.59]I will say, only the five is capitalized in Five Night at Freddy's.
[218:13.16]So...
[218:15.29]And then there's no description.
[218:18.59]Yeah.
[218:18.73]I mean, that one didn't have any ratings on it.
[218:20.79]It had a lot of plays, but no one rated it.
[218:23.07]So keep in mind, that one, it was new.
[218:25.89]It was made, like, last week, which means this is a passionate Five Nights at Freddy's fan.
[218:31.07]Really?
[218:31.43]That loves this game.
[218:32.45]Alright, what's up to you guys?
[218:35.05]Why am I offline?
[218:35.89]What the fuck?
[218:47.08]So which one are we going to?
[218:48.28]You're going to do Jigsaw.
[218:53.35]We could do Five Nights at Freddy's.
[218:55.33]Oh, my God.
[218:55.87]I remember Jigsaw.
[218:56.79]We did that one.
[218:57.43]It was steamy garbage.
[218:59.78]Or Jigsaw 2.
[219:02.02]Saw 2, I don't think we ever did.
[219:03.08]I remember doing Jigsaw 1, and it was steamy.
[219:06.36]Okay.
[219:07.89]Alright, let's do, let's do Saw 2 just cause we, I think we had fun last Saw 1 until it suddenly wasn't fun.
[219:12.85]So, let's uh... It was good until it wasn't.
[219:15.99]It was like five minutes and we just fucking ran into and did like a fucking parkour bit.
[219:24.39]That was the entirety of the map.
[219:25.69]It was like all of us were in those different trap plans.
[219:31.09]Oh god, it changed to the same font.
[219:33.33]It's the same fucking guy.
[219:34.45]I mean, why would he skip making a Saw 2, you know?
[219:38.35]I'm getting errors.
[219:41.86]Uh-oh.
[219:42.64]Synchronizing game settings awaiting textures.
[219:44.98]Yeah, I got that too.
[219:46.94]It's him again.
[219:48.00]Killjoy, you son of a bitch.
[219:50.04]He's done it again.
[219:51.22]How many of your maps have I put in this thing now, Killjoy?
[219:56.57]Wait, I'm separated.
[219:57.31]Your character.
[219:58.23]No, you're not.
[219:59.33]You're like, find a wall.
[220:00.83]I see a wall and I'm just like, I'm gone.
[220:04.03]Whoa!
[220:04.65]Interrupted.
[220:07.72]I'm in.
[220:08.32]I'm, like, good to go.
[220:09.16]I just teleported around briefly.
[220:12.35]Oh, boy.
[220:13.81]Oh, boy.
[220:14.09]Guys, this one has zombies.
[220:15.31]This one actually has zombies.
[220:17.89]Boo.
[220:18.53]Oh, no.
[220:19.35]I'm playing this game for the zombies.
[220:21.86]We need a bowie knife.
[220:23.48]Yeah, there's one right here.
[220:24.16]We need 3,000 for it.
[220:25.40]I need more souls for my toilet.
[220:28.18]It says so on my toilet.
[220:31.89]Guys, we need to let the zombies in so we can put it in the soul toilet now.
[220:34.99]Do we actually have a soul toilet?
[220:36.53]Is it for real?
[220:37.09]Yeah, check the wall, bud.
[220:39.45]Oh, man.
[220:41.17]We're going to need souls for this thing.
[220:44.13]I just picked up an industrial drill from the toilet bowl.
[220:49.07]Oh!
[220:50.07]We're wiping.
[220:50.69]We're wiping.
[220:51.21]Yes, we are.
[220:51.73]That's it.
[220:52.89]We're wiping.
[220:57.37]Okay, this is good.
[220:58.12]These are all going into the souls toilet.
[221:03.65]We have half as much as we need for the Bowie knife.
[221:07.95]So how are they going to get closer to the toilet then?
[221:09.77]Oh God.
[221:13.55]I can't see for shit on this map.
[221:15.23]Oh my.
[221:16.07]Whoa.
[221:18.71]Wait, what just happened?
[221:21.33]Okay.
[221:23.13]Loading something.
[221:24.49]I think we won.
[221:26.81]G underscore spawn.
[221:28.25]No free entities.
[221:29.96]Alright, Game of Thrones, it's time for us.
[221:32.89]Didn't pay for that one.
[221:34.73]It's time.
[221:35.05]Nothing's for free.
[221:37.73]We gotta play into that pandering.
[221:41.23]I don't know.
[221:42.27]I'm trying to find Game of Thrones, but I don't think I see it in my list.
[221:44.81]I might need to re-download it.
[221:48.51]I have Dead Ship.
[221:50.50]I have... It's in capital letters called Game of Thrones.
[221:56.56]You won't be able to miss the picture because it says, Welcome to Ice Grenade's Tutorial Zombie Mod.
[222:02.34]I think he might have put the wrong map in his Game of Thrones mod.
[222:05.40]But I promise, guys, it's going to be good.
[222:08.04]It looked good.
[222:10.14]Ooh.
[222:10.40]Yeah, I got to reinstall that one.
[222:13.86]Is that in the pack?
[222:15.60]It should be in the pack, yeah.
[222:17.21]I might have missed it, though.
[222:21.37]I'll be right back.
[222:22.63]Okay.
[222:26.55]Did my microphone get fucked up again, or is it okay?
[222:28.59]No, you're good.
[222:29.13]Oh, man.
[222:37.23]Yeah, I don't know.
[222:38.15]It's listed on mine.
[222:38.93]I guess I can host now.
[222:39.91]I don't know if I have everyone on Steam.
[222:41.55]I guess you could join on Criken, everyone who doesn't.
[222:44.90]I think that should work.
[222:46.74]Out.
[222:47.00]Okay, then Criken, you just join on me on
[222:49.80]Okay.
[222:53.10]Stairway to Hell looks good.
[222:57.13]Oh, this.
[222:58.21]Now this one.
[222:59.83]Now this is going to be a good level.
[223:01.13]I think it takes place in the famous Castle Black.
[223:05.87]Oh.
[223:07.07]Okay.
[223:10.13]Alright, I joined.
[223:15.82]I know the dog smell.
[223:16.98]Thank you.
[223:19.86]Thank you.
[223:21.84]I'm glad somebody does.
[223:25.42]I've been waiting four and a half months for somebody to say that.
[223:29.54]Thank you.
[223:30.14]Awesome.
[223:31.44]Did you?
[223:32.76]I... Run back my way out.
[223:36.33]Let's see if James can join.
[223:38.29]I have him.
[223:40.05]James, take my invite.
[223:43.99]I think you would AFK.
[223:45.95]Oh, dude.
[223:47.37]I went to go BRB.
[223:51.50]lobby's not joinable huh it's set for friends only oh yeah you're in now okay yeah for some reason alright it says I I mean I can be in the lobby so okay alright let me invite Jerma it's okay uh I can I not join off you or do you have to invite uh you should be able to drop me
[224:15.40]Let's see.
[224:16.76]Oh wait, it might not be.
[224:17.62]Hang on, let me open up the server.
[224:20.31]Right now it's set to friends only.
[224:21.55]We are not friends.
[224:22.81]I did join game off of Criken and there's a loading screen.
[224:25.91]Alright, try that.
[224:27.91]Let's try this one.
[224:30.89]Hey, there we go.
[224:32.57]Cool.
[224:43.48]This is gonna be a good one.
[224:46.35]I know I picked at least one good map.
[224:48.57]And guess what?
[224:49.07]I thought this one was made by Killjoy.
[224:50.38]Is that a good or a bad thing?
[224:53.82]Well, what do you think?
[224:57.64]I have nothing but respect for Killjoy.
[224:58.78]This one does YouTube tutorials for Call of Duty Zombies mod-making maps, so, you know.
[225:04.58]Oh.
[225:06.06]I'm familiar with YouTube.
[225:08.76]You ever heard of it, Matt?
[225:11.24]I think we should break in the Black Ops 3 YouTube scene.
[225:15.44]Dude, I think we should break into tutorials in general.
[225:17.38]I don't think enough people do them anymore.
[225:23.11]Alright, I'm going to grab a B-roll waiting for James.
[225:24.83]We can also probably start loading.
[225:26.33]I'm not going to abandon James.
[225:29.15]Wait, is everyone doing a little B-roll?
[225:32.98]You want us to leave James?
[225:33.88]I'll go grab another water.
[225:35.94]He's getting, like, another drink.
[225:37.16]Sometimes it takes him a while.
[225:39.14]He's got bad legs, you know.
[225:41.08]Alright, I'm gonna sprint downstairs and grab a little water.
[225:43.80]And I'm gonna sprint back up as fast as I can.
[225:45.46]I'm gonna get hurt doing it.
[225:46.28]Okay.
[225:46.98]Should I time you?
[225:48.50]It's gonna be 45 seconds, guaranteed.
[225:51.14]45 seconds.
[225:51.84]Guaranteed.
[225:53.98]Starting 10 seconds after you hear the door close.
[225:57.11]After I hear what?
[225:58.03]After you hear the door close behind me, 10 seconds.
[226:04.06]Alright, we're back.
[227:17.62]There may have been some developments on my side too.
[227:20.54]I know what developments happened, kind of.
[227:24.44]Sideway eyes.
[227:26.04]I haven't played on the server.
[227:30.23]It says the lobby's not joinable.
[227:32.07]What?
[227:33.21]What?
[227:34.05]There are three people in here.
[227:37.78]That's what it says.
[227:40.20]Let me invite you.
[227:41.44]Let me give you a personal invite, my friend James.
[227:45.12]Jerma, have you ever tried GTA RP?
[227:48.32]No, never.
[227:50.28]Are you interested?
[227:52.10]Probably not.
[227:53.58]Okay.
[227:55.22]Easy conversation.
[227:56.72]That was about as quick as we got rejected inviting people to this stream.
[228:01.37]Yeah, really.
[228:01.99]That's what you should have said.
[228:03.71]You're like...
[228:05.89]Hey, you want to do this zombies thing?
[228:08.05]Probably not.
[228:09.33]Not really.
[228:10.29]Okay.
[228:13.29]James, can you still not get in?
[228:15.15]It won't let me.
[228:16.71]Let me check.
[228:17.63]Let me go off the message on Steam.
[228:19.87]Yeah, try that, because now there are enough people in that something weird is going on.
[228:24.59]I just clicked it.
[228:29.63]It's not that I don't think it would be fun.
[228:32.27]You just don't like us.
[228:33.09]I get it.
[228:37.78]yeah I mean like what this is the first thing you've done with us I'm like I know I wouldn't blame him after this this is a disaster you got you got what you guys just talking about how you guys are getting like banned from the server you want me to jump in on your crew no no no no there's no drama with the admins alright we we know the admins okay look we're we're cool with them it's this is more of a it's a beef alright their gang versus our gang
[229:00.14]Dude, I did something pretty questionable last night that my chat was telling me that I could potentially get banned for.
[229:05.70]Oh, okay.
[229:06.14]I'm not going to speak for James.
[229:07.28]I don't know.
[229:10.35]No, but I figured it out later.
[229:11.95]Someone else on the server said it was all cool.
[229:17.15]I used information that I got from roleplaying and I did something dirty.
[229:21.53]Ooh.
[229:22.49]But it was from roleplaying.
[229:24.32]Okay.
[229:26.27]Everything my character does is dear.
[229:27.59]Is Criken going to have to host since James can't join my game for some reason?
[229:31.63]I'm trying to accept your invite.
[229:33.45]It just keeps saying can't join.
[229:35.17]Try joining, like, off of... Yeah, join me or join... I think that's how I did it.
[229:42.04]Lobby not joinable.
[229:43.00]What the fuck is this error?
[229:45.98]Try it again.
[229:46.48]Errors everywhere.
[229:47.30]Errors everywhere.
[229:52.11]I mean, Criken, as long as we know that map appears or something for you, now that you know what it's called.
[229:57.20]It's labeled as Game of Thrones on the map list.
[229:59.02]Well, I swear that I'm not going to be able to find it in my own lobby for some reason.
[230:02.36]It's still not working.
[230:03.64]I'm going to host again.
[230:05.28]Yeah, let's see if you can find it.
[230:06.08]It's like all caps Game of Thrones.
[230:11.74]Shadow, am I blind?
[230:12.58]Where is this thing?
[230:14.77]You subscribed to everything like that I sent you most recently, right?
[230:17.73]I think so, but... But you have most of it there.
[230:19.82]That one was pretty... That one might have been one of the last ones on that list in the collection.
[230:24.90]I might have had the same issue as some of the people where my... Oh, there it is.
[230:28.46]I see it.
[230:29.70]Okay, I got it.
[230:30.10]It's about GTA RP.
[230:31.06]It's just a bunch of cringy dudes.
[230:32.32]That's the point, man.
[230:34.06]Oof, dude.
[230:35.40]They got my number.
[230:36.72]We can all be cringy together.
[230:38.11]That's right.
[230:42.06]We're just as cringy in the server as we are IRL.
[230:44.88]Cringy?
[230:47.92]Cringy.
[230:49.82]Oh, cringe.
[230:52.66]Cringy.
[230:55.11]There we go.
[230:55.73]It worked.
[230:56.11]I'm going to make that my username.
[230:57.65]What's your problem, James?
[230:58.97]What's your problem with me?
[231:00.33]Steam filters only true friends, Tomato.
[231:02.99]What the fuck?
[231:04.05]Alright.
[231:04.47]Let's go.
[231:08.03]Are you guys ready for... By the way, it says Game of Thrones spoilers if you've never seen the show.
[231:12.94]Game of Thrones spoilers.
[231:15.90]I actually don't know how many spoilers this might have.
[231:18.04]That's a pretty good warning.
[231:21.10]If you've seen the first episode, you should probably be good.
[231:25.04]Watch this come up all of a sudden.
[231:30.53]Chad told me to turn on dev mode so I can use cheats, and that may have broken some of these maps, because I keep getting errors.
[231:36.61]Are you cheating?
[231:37.41]Do you even know how to undo that, if it's breaking stuff?
[231:41.11]Oh, wow, dude, it's so... Oh, fuck.
[231:44.95]White walkers.
[231:46.17]What the... What the fuck?
[231:48.15]Ew!
[231:48.31]What?
[231:53.27]Enable copyright sounds.
[231:55.17]Fucking chat.
[231:56.35]Fuck you, chat.
[231:57.37]What?
[231:57.73]Freaking you completely broke your own game, man.
[232:00.45]Yes.
[232:00.74]Play the intro song.
[232:03.23]Oh, dude!
[232:04.64]Alright, I can't actually leave this.
[232:08.26]I can barely hear it.
[232:09.86]Alright, I'm sorry.
[232:10.66]I'm crashing.
[232:11.14]That's not the song!
[232:13.34]No!
[232:13.84]I closed the lock.
[232:16.65]Because I was not playable.
[232:19.21]Why did you open a thing called Dev Mode for online co-op?
[232:23.89]Because chat was like, that's how you can noclip, friend.
[232:27.56]Let me teach you.
[232:30.19]Alright.
[232:30.53]Sorry, guys.
[232:31.75]Chat, bad.
[232:33.09]Emote only mode for the next five minutes.
[232:34.67]And I'm playing an ad.
[232:38.78]Oh, damn.
[232:41.14]That map didn't actually look that bad, though.
[232:42.68]Did you see that wall?
[232:43.78]Yeah, I like the voice acting.
[232:45.56]I like the voice acting and the wall.
[232:47.26]They couldn't put the elevator in, so they just made it stairs, which is okay, I guess.
[232:54.27]Dev mode.
[232:55.97]Mods, enable emote only mode.
[232:58.35]I don't know how.
[233:00.77]Watch out for my mic.
[233:01.41]Why should I watch out for my mic?
[233:02.75]Your mic did the thing, I think.
[233:03.81]Watch out.
[233:07.19]Loud.
[233:07.69]Loud.
[233:08.01]Loud.
[233:08.75]Loud.
[233:11.17]Screamer.
[233:11.85]Why have we not gotten a screamer yet?
[233:14.15]That's kind of unfortunate.
[233:15.35]Yeah.
[233:16.25]I want either a screamer or tits.
[233:18.57]And I got neither.
[233:20.34]I can find tits and put them in this mod pack if you guys really want that.
[233:23.98]I can look like right now.
[233:25.44]I want to get banned.
[233:28.12]Now you're too quiet.
[233:28.92]Yeah, now you're too quiet.
[233:31.26]I wanna get paid.
[233:32.41]I can take all your accounts out right now if you want.
[233:34.91]I can slip it in.
[233:36.11]Do you guys want me to?
[233:37.15]I can't.
[233:38.13]It's a part of a video game.
[233:39.19]It's fine.
[233:40.57]Wait, did I ever tell you guys about my, uh, my, my, like, my porn challenge idea?
[233:46.27]What?
[233:46.61]What is a porn challenge?
[233:47.73]What does that mean?
[233:49.35]Okay, alright, hear me out.
[233:52.75]You know how you can have multiple, uh,
[233:56.04]screens like you know everyone's got multiple monitors right yeah so the idea is uh we're gonna stream with display capture and one of the monitors that it's off screen is gonna be playing porn the entire stream and oh yeah I do remember you just have to ignore it and have it muted and like it's just gonna be on the whole time and everyone's gonna know it's there but as long as it's not on screen you can't get in trouble for it right
[234:22.17]So it's like who's fucking stuff glitches out first or something and fucking resets the desktop.
[234:28.06]It's just like this mental game of like watching chat and on the other side of the monitor watching hard.
[234:33.60]Oh, no, we did.
[234:34.58]I remember we also established the rule that you had to be, you had to have a source open for desktop capture on the desktop next to it.
[234:41.93]Yeah, so it's like the adjacent desktop has to have capture on.
[234:46.77]It's playing a dance with death.
[234:51.19]It's the only way I know how to feel alive anymore.
[234:53.17]Exactly.
[234:53.49]Alright.
[234:54.19]How we... Are we ready to... I invited you.
[234:56.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[234:58.71]I mean, I showed porn on stream before.
[235:00.69]I got an infraction and that was it.
[235:02.31]I didn't get banned.
[235:04.02]You showed porn on stream before?
[235:06.62]I remember this stretch when you were streaming where it seemed like you had an infraction every other day.
[235:10.44]I think that was during that time, yes.
[235:13.85]There was like this stretch where you were always on an infraction.
[235:17.03]Was there context to it?
[235:18.41]Or just like, this was a nice porn clip I saw, who wants to watch it?
[235:21.35]You know that fucking Super Seducer game?
[235:24.35]They had like a link in it, like when you're dating one of the chicks and she said something.
[235:30.33]I thought it was like a fake website or something.
[235:32.23]Oh no.
[235:32.64]And I pulled it up and it was real.
[235:36.00]It was like deepthroat.com or something like that.
[235:38.96]Oh my God.
[235:40.64]I mean, how did you not expect that to be like an active address?
[235:43.40]That's not a real address?
[235:44.96]I don't know what it was.
[235:46.32]That was probably the first one ever.
[235:48.18]Yeah, yeah.
[235:49.06]I mean, there's no way that wasn't taken by someone.
[235:51.88]That dates back to like 1996.
[235:53.60]That's an old one.
[235:56.78]I got a slap on the wrist for it.
[235:58.32]Alright, you guys can release the mode-only mode.
[236:00.65]Sorry, everybody.
[236:01.35]You had to be taught a lesson, alright?
[236:04.10]You guys ever do that to your chats?
[236:04.96]You teach them a lesson?
[236:06.05]Slap around a little?
[236:07.49]No, I've never actually heard of this punishment.
[236:09.55]My chat's usually okay.
[236:11.25]Yeah, yours is nice because you're training them well.
[236:13.83]That's my problem.
[236:14.83]You gotta train them when they're puppies.
[236:16.31]Otherwise, they get, you know?
[236:17.97]I make examples out of people.
[236:19.79]Alright, we're in Game of Thrones.
[236:22.21]Finally, we get to play Game of Thrones.
[236:23.59]I'm gonna turn on a theme song.
[236:25.83]Yes, quick, do it.
[236:26.37]I'm gonna turn up my music.
[236:28.57]Welcome to Ice Green's map.
[236:29.59]Oh, there it is.
[236:37.35]Play copyright here?
[236:39.25]What?
[236:39.87]It's the intro.
[236:40.35]You can play the theme.
[236:41.45]It's playing the theme.
[236:42.55]Oh.
[236:43.61]So, VOD's muted?
[236:45.44]Yeah.
[236:46.26]Alright, bye guys.
[236:47.26]Bye VOD chat.
[236:48.42]VOD's muted.
[236:51.52]And it transitions.
[236:52.30]It turns into a different song.
[236:53.92]They're coming.
[236:54.58]They have top hats and shit.
[236:56.48]Just like in Game of Thrones.
[236:57.64]Just like in Game of Thrones.
[236:59.69]You do not know.
[237:02.47]Ew.
[237:03.05]The walkers don't care.
[237:07.88]Okay, we have to- Actually, you know, this doesn't look too half bad.
[237:12.50]Dude, I loved when Johnson whipped out his fucking Glock and gunned down like eight guys in the woods.
[237:18.72]Bunch of undead bastards.
[237:22.50]This thing costs 500, huh?
[237:23.36]Is that a gun?
[237:24.96]They're coming.
[237:26.08]No matter what you do.
[237:29.40]I can't read the font of any of this.
[237:33.56]I'm having trouble telling how much ammo I have.
[237:35.24]Dude, look at the UI on the right.
[237:37.32]The Game of Thrones logo.
[237:38.41]Yeah, I'm having trouble reading into what I'm working with here.
[237:44.11]Dude, I just got Jon's fucking sword!
[237:46.25]Wait, what?
[237:47.91]I do, I have it.
[237:48.98]You got ice?
[237:50.12]No, that's Ned Stark's sword.
[237:51.14]I got it.
[237:52.18]Longclaw.
[237:52.90]I got Longclaw.
[237:53.80]Longclaw.
[237:55.58]Where the heck did you find that?
[237:58.06]Oh my God.
[237:58.40]What the fuck was that?
[238:00.08]I'm unstoppable now.
[238:01.44]Don't use your guns.
[238:02.92]Use long claws.
[238:05.09]Long claws.
[238:05.79]Stop using your guns.
[238:07.21]It's free.
[238:07.53]It's right over here.
[238:08.79]It's free?
[238:09.87]Yeah.
[238:11.21]Oh, it is free.
[238:12.13]Randomly in this pile?
[238:13.45]Wow.
[238:13.88]This is tough.
[238:14.38]I feel a sudden change in my momentum.
[238:17.58]Is that text to speech?
[238:19.18]Yeah.
[238:19.52]Yeah.
[238:20.16]That's...
[238:21.37]Alright, well, I'm gonna start climbing the wall, and by me, I mean whoever's the yellow guy.
[238:27.26]Longclaw doesn't even do that.
[238:30.50]Explode them?
[238:31.36]Yeah, they go flying.
[238:33.62]Oh, we haven't seen the big battle yet.
[238:35.00]Maybe it will.
[238:36.72]Oh, everyone, Jon Snow pulled out his gun.
[238:39.28]Hold on, hold on.
[238:42.06]What is this death music?
[238:44.48]Oh, no!
[238:46.00]I think we need to start switching to using guns.
[238:48.02]Yeah, I think the guns will probably help.
[238:49.89]Help.
[238:51.38]Oh, God.
[238:53.48]Cover me.
[238:55.87]If you still melee, even when you're using guns... They look drowsy.
[239:00.41]Is that just Wolverine?
[239:04.73]I'm gonna open some of the way up.
[239:06.15]Come on, guys.
[239:06.75]Up the wall.
[239:07.33]Shoot those pesky crows.
[239:08.79]They look evil.
[239:10.54]They look evil?
[239:11.84]Shoot those pesky crows.
[239:12.94]They look evil?
[239:15.16]Come on.
[239:16.12]We gotta go.
[239:16.46]We're going in slow-mo.
[239:22.02]White walkers remaining.
[239:23.34]60.
[239:23.52]I've got 6,800.
[239:24.52]Oh, bingo.
[239:28.29]I'm glad there's only 60 white walkers in their army.
[239:30.37]This will be lucked out.
[239:32.57]This isn't as bad as everyone was saying.
[239:33.83]This next one's 3,000.
[239:35.37]I got it.
[239:37.01]Oh my god.
[239:38.05]Big spender, boys.
[239:38.91]Let's go.
[239:39.21]This is a big map of straight line walls.
[239:44.93]They're coming.
[239:45.55]Could it be the Lightbringer?
[239:47.21]Yes!
[239:48.25]The Lightbringer!
[239:49.63]There's a dragon!
[239:50.55]Is there a dragon?
[239:52.09]Oh my god.
[239:53.51]I'm instantly crying.
[239:55.11]I'm instantly crying.
[239:57.31]I wanted to say that so bad.
[239:59.49]I'm fucking crying.
[240:07.85]Is that a pack-a-punch?
[240:09.01]What is this?
[240:09.61]Yeah, I just pack-a-punched it.
[240:12.13]I should have done it on the sword.
[240:13.21]Damn it.
[240:15.55]That's how you get Lightbringer.
[240:16.95]You pack-a-punch the sword.
[240:19.42]Wait, where is it?
[240:20.60]What the fuck?
[240:21.38]What happened?
[240:22.22]Why do some of these white walkers have top hats on?
[240:26.12]We're going to have to go save them.
[240:27.10]It's medieval ages.
[240:28.30]Shame on you.
[240:30.50]Shame on you?
[240:31.22]Shame on you.
[240:32.68]What is this pack-a-punch thing?
[240:34.94]It was a, it was a pickup.
[240:36.08]It was a pickup.
[240:37.02]Yeah.
[240:38.16]Well, uh... Shame.
[240:39.76]Who wants to clear these dead horses off the road?
[240:42.22]Shame.
[240:43.32]Shame on you, George Stowe.
[240:46.65]Why is, what's censored over there?
[240:47.75]Is somebody naked?
[240:49.31]There's like a censor over here.
[240:50.67]How much further is this route?
[240:52.57]They just don't seem to stop coming.
[240:54.97]I don't know.
[240:56.17]I don't know who that's supposed to be.
[240:58.60]I mean, none of us.
[240:59.52]They're behind us.
[241:00.38]They're behind us.
[241:02.79]Alright, we gotta watch what's behind us, because we are getting... No, I just got a pack.
[241:07.47]I got a perk pack, whatever it is.
[241:09.96]James, come on!
[241:10.80]I lost.
[241:11.78]Ah, I got back to ammo!
[241:13.04]Iron-thrown ammo.
[241:14.34]Oh, you're in trouble.
[241:19.10]I remember the super laser gun that Jon Snow used to defeat the White Walkers.
[241:24.30]I actually fucked this.
[241:30.27]I want this.
[241:30.67]Alright, we have a lot of money.
[241:32.30]Yeah, let's use a lot of that money to open up this $6,000 door.
[241:35.54]I'll get this one.
[241:38.25]Probably $8,000 on the next one.
[241:39.65]$7,000.
[241:40.57]I think they can get us.
[241:46.91]They're going to be the final boss.
[241:48.99]$8,000 on this one.
[241:49.64]Oh, Jesus.
[241:51.28]They're coming.
[241:51.88]At least they can't get up here easily.
[241:56.82]Dude, it's just... That laser is so loud.
[241:59.24]It should just blast the theme song.
[242:02.64]I just can't hear anyone else.
[242:04.20]That one had a baseball cap on.
[242:05.56]What the fuck?
[242:06.98]Two times ammo.
[242:08.72]I got Valerian steel grenades.
[242:11.29]Valerian steel grenades.
[242:12.79]Ow, what the fuck?
[242:15.47]This isn't doing anything right now.
[242:29.54]Oh my god.
[242:36.90]I was ready to move on!
[242:40.81]Bird noises.
[242:41.79]Something down there!
[242:43.31]Something down there!
[242:45.45]There's something down there!
[242:46.75]Right out with me!
[242:47.69]Oh!
[242:49.61]No!
[242:51.33]There's another pack-a-punch down there!
[242:55.44]Oh, dang.
[242:56.78]That's really good.
[243:00.56]There's too much shit in the way!
[243:03.50]They're starting to break through.
[243:04.56]It's gone.
[243:04.78]It's gone.
[243:05.22]It's gonna disappear.
[243:08.58]Wait, what happened?
[243:09.14]Jerma, weren't you picking me up?
[243:10.26]What happened?
[243:11.60]I'm sorry.
[243:12.06]I'm trying.
[243:19.30]I'm going.
[243:19.80]Fuck you guys.
[243:20.82]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[243:22.76]I'm down to the sword.
[243:23.99]Getting close to being out of ammo, Khaleesi.
[243:31.55]Wait!
[243:31.73]Come on!
[243:32.23]Come on!
[243:32.69]I'm out of ammo.
[243:35.54]What is this?
[243:36.96]9,000!
[243:38.04]No.
[243:40.30]I can't even do the thing.
[243:41.76]I don't have any ammo left, man.
[243:43.48]I'm gonna die.
[243:47.24]Well, down to this.
[243:48.82]Hold the line.
[243:52.39]Shame on you.
[243:53.65]We did it.
[243:54.71]They all exploded.
[243:55.43]Get up.
[243:56.01]Get the fuck up.
[243:57.95]Oh, my God.
[243:59.33]Get through there.
[243:59.93]Whoever has 9,000.
[244:01.27]I could use a revive.
[244:02.13]I think it's Jerma.
[244:03.95]Wait, where is he?
[244:05.43]I'm up.
[244:06.69]What?
[244:07.39]Oh.
[244:08.35]Wow, we're so close to the dragons now.
[244:09.73]We gotta open this thing.
[244:10.61]Yeah, someone's gotta open it.
[244:11.87]Oh my god.
[244:12.73]You gotta open it.
[244:13.63]Use your incredible wealth.
[244:16.27]I'm going to get it.
[244:19.89]Open the door!
[244:21.77]Open the door!
[244:23.35]Which way is the door?
[244:24.55]I can't.
[244:27.98]Which is the door?
[244:29.28]What door?
[244:30.14]It's this thing!
[244:31.00]Open it!
[244:31.52]I can't.
[244:32.94]There's no indicator.
[244:34.12]Just hold F on it.
[244:38.20]Dude!
[244:38.80]Open the door!
[244:41.34]Open the door!
[244:43.26]Open the door!
[244:44.32]Open the door!
[244:45.25]There's nothing here.
[244:47.89]Stand right here.
[244:48.87]Wait, okay.
[244:49.67]Now I can see it.
[244:50.65]It wasn't there before.
[244:51.47]I swear to halt the door.
[244:52.35]They look drowsy.
[244:53.21]I froze them.
[244:55.07]Oh, my God.
[244:55.85]This one's 10,000.
[244:56.87]Oh, my God.
[245:01.51]There's no ammo up here.
[245:03.61]Oh, my God.
[245:04.65]There's no ammo.
[245:05.35]Seems like this might be the end of our journey, boys.
[245:08.95]Make a count.
[245:11.03]Make every shot count.
[245:12.05]Every single one of them.
[245:14.09]I've used all of my shots, sir.
[245:16.33]Now...
[245:17.42]If your bullet's not a headshot, don't take the shot.
[245:21.06]I'm out of ammo.
[245:23.27]I'm back from the wall.
[245:26.45]I feel a sudden change in my momentum.
[245:30.93]I feel like I just felt a sudden change in my momentum.
[245:33.92]I feel a sudden change in my momentum.
[245:37.68]This gun is so bad.
[245:40.60]I don't know why I'm still using the sword.
[245:42.85]I'm gonna go down.
[245:44.25]Troy's good, dude.
[245:45.55]It's not!
[245:45.95]Ammo!
[245:46.25]Ammo!
[245:46.49]Get it!
[245:47.47]Get it!
[245:47.97]Get it!
[245:48.37]I got it!
[245:48.93]Yes!
[245:49.17]I'm gonna open it up!
[245:49.93]I'm opening it!
[245:50.59]No!
[245:50.77]That's what we call infinite ammo.
[245:52.49]There's a lighting bolt down there.
[246:09.42]Come on!
[246:11.15]This next one is 11,000.
[246:12.83]Oh, my God.
[246:14.79]Someone's almost got enough.
[246:17.19]It's me.
[246:17.57]It's me.
[246:18.19]I just need a couple more hits.
[246:20.29]What's the lighting bolt?
[246:21.01]Go, go, go, go, go.
[246:22.26]Go get it.
[246:23.08]Got it.
[246:25.60]It's open.
[246:26.18]Let's move.
[246:27.56]Almost to the top.
[246:28.22]Oh, my God.
[246:28.52]This is so epic.
[246:29.64]I think there's one more.
[246:32.12]Why are these doors so expensive?
[246:34.34]I'll get it.
[246:34.74]I'll get it.
[246:35.74]I'll get it.
[246:36.68]I think the character, I think the fucking character just said, ask why it's so expensive.
[246:41.98]What the fuck?
[246:43.57]I think they're breaking the wall.
[246:44.83]Help.
[246:45.09]Help, guys.
[246:45.85]Oh, my God.
[246:46.33]What do you mean?
[246:47.35]I have 13,000.
[246:48.07]They came from behind you.
[246:48.77]So far away, dude.
[246:49.67]You guys weren't with me.
[246:51.73]You weren't with us is what happens.
[246:54.03]Oh, shit.
[246:55.57]I was holding them literally all off.
[246:58.44]Oh, God.
[246:58.88]This is a long trip.
[247:05.59]There's too many people down here.
[247:08.57]There's only 70 left, guys.
[247:11.13]Start crawling towards us.
[247:12.71]They're breaking in.
[247:14.95]Use those nades!
[247:16.23]I can't crawl anymore.
[247:18.28]They're spawning up here, too!
[247:21.22]They're spawning up here!
[247:22.64]I'm out of ammo.
[247:25.78]Get that one off of me!
[247:28.28]Just push me off of you, dude!
[247:29.50]I can't get you!
[247:30.18]No!
[247:34.50]Come on, James Snow.
[247:35.52]You can do it.
[247:36.64]You have like 400 enemies.
[247:39.50]And back.
[247:39.76]Nice.
[247:39.92]Yeah, we can do this.
[247:45.85]We can do this.
[248:04.48]It's a shame that we're about to crash out.
[248:05.98]How are the White Walkers still dying?
[248:07.32]Are they killing each other?
[248:14.69]What if we just sit here and let it get to zero?
[248:17.05]They were running off the side of the edge.
[248:19.59]They just didn't want to live anymore.
[248:20.97]Hey, no crash.
[248:21.65]That's pretty good.
[248:23.48]That was pretty good.
[248:24.76]Alright, let's go again.
[248:28.70]We can actually do this one.
[248:31.70]The amount of times that I try to arrest someone and then a zombie pushes me off of them like a fucking asshole is getting a little bit wild.
[248:43.99]We were almost there, too.
[248:45.67]I think the sword.
[248:46.45]I think I got too distracted carrying around the sword.
[248:49.27]I sacrificed not having a full extra gun to, you know, shoot with.
[248:53.80]My chat's toxic, dude.
[248:54.46]I'm going to give him a minute long ad this time.
[248:55.88]Dude, give them more ads.
[248:57.88]Yeah.
[248:59.70]They're blaming me for us losing.
[249:03.44]Pointing fingers ain't gonna get us over that wall, you know?
[249:10.46]Hold the door, Khaleesi.
[249:11.82]You know now.
[249:13.24]You need to get out of here.
[249:15.94]You need to get out of here.
[249:18.36]We gotta get out of here.
[249:19.52]As we sin, so do we suffer.
[249:25.08]What should we make of this sinner, my lord?
[249:32.91]Shout out to Simbo for his support.
[249:39.18]There it is, I hear it.
[249:40.76]Okay, I played it.
[249:43.72]So cinematic.
[249:46.99]Maybe we, I think we should let them get in here first, because then they have a chance to drop the pack-a-punch, and that thing, like, fucking saved my ass.
[249:53.81]Yep, that is true.
[249:55.39]Should I not open this thing yet?
[249:56.29]Good call.
[249:57.64]Yeah.
[250:02.02]Shame, shame on you.
[250:04.58]That's one of his songs.
[250:06.16]Well, it dropped a nuke.
[250:07.88]Yeah.
[250:09.20]Sure did.
[250:09.74]I guess I'll open the first tier, unless it's like, should we just wait until we're completely like fucked, can't do anything?
[250:15.91]I mean, if you open that tier, they can start spawning behind us, which is better.
[250:18.71]Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[250:19.85]So maybe we wait a minute.
[250:21.77]My favorite part, favorite part.
[250:24.91]Oh, there it is.
[250:27.20]Should we get quick revive?
[250:28.94]Would that be... I feel like... I feel like none of us get quick revive.
[250:34.39]Including me.
[250:36.27]So, wait, if you go down, you can just get right back up?
[250:39.13]No, it means that we can basically rez each other in like a quarter of a second.
[250:41.95]It means I would have been able to rez you that last round.
[250:45.53]Pretty much, if I had it.
[250:47.98]Ew, what?
[250:49.84]Well, there's also Juggernaug at the top there, too.
[250:53.40]That's kind of what helped me out a little bit.
[250:55.84]Ow.
[250:56.92]I'm taking damage.
[250:57.55]I'm going to get quick revive.
[250:58.99]I'm going to get it.
[251:01.43]Max ammo.
[251:01.89]Max ammo.
[251:02.35]We should save that.
[251:05.25]Did anyone even use any?
[251:06.45]If you're just using melees right now?
[251:07.99]I know, right?
[251:08.91]Like, right now that I was reminded again, it doesn't exist.
[251:15.78]Oh, enough firecrackers.
[251:19.20]Oh, my.
[251:19.50]They go up.
[251:19.92]Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[251:22.30]What happened?
[251:22.82]Can you buy it up here?
[251:24.30]We didn't fit an ammo.
[251:27.00]I just see red.
[251:27.64]Why is my sword going red?
[251:29.00]Can someone buy the...
[251:44.26]Can you stop blowing into your microphone?
[251:51.73]It's just... I love the iron sights on this sword.
[251:59.65]It's got a really good zoom.
[252:01.36]The iron sights, yeah.
[252:02.90]Did anyone do it yet?
[252:05.14]I was waiting on someone with more money to do it, but I guess I'll have to.
[252:08.54]I opened it.
[252:09.16]It's already open.
[252:10.30]We're getting overwhelmed now.
[252:13.62]I'm down.
[252:13.88]Bye.
[252:13.96]Come on, gentlemen.
[252:19.27]Oh, this is what quick revive is for.
[252:20.43]Let me get him.
[252:21.13]No, no, no.
[252:21.75]I gotta save the quick revive.
[252:23.07]Should be good.
[252:24.23]The gods are with us.
[252:25.95]Alright.
[252:26.27]Let's go because everything's starting to flank us.
[252:27.96]Gods be good.
[252:28.56]I'll get this one.
[252:29.88]Nice.
[252:30.26]Gods be good.
[252:42.03]Yeah, James, why is your sword on fire?
[252:44.77]I don't know.
[252:46.11]On fire?
[252:47.41]Looked like it was on fire.
[252:50.03]Whoa.
[252:53.44]An Uzi.
[252:54.68]Wow, an Uzi in fucking Game of Thrones, dude.
[252:59.58]Dude, the thunder gun in Game of Thrones.
[253:02.22]Holy shit.
[253:03.06]Whoa, this is really good for the wall, dude.
[253:05.95]This is actually pretty good.
[253:08.43]You got that.
[253:10.49]Oh, shit.
[253:14.12]The Matrix?
[253:17.61]They look drowsy.
[253:24.21]They look drowsy.
[253:28.77]Should I buy the next tier?
[253:31.13]Whoa!
[253:31.99]Oh, the Man of War 2.
[253:32.87]Alright, I'm good for guns.
[253:35.57]I'll be putting all my stuff into the... I think we're at 5,000 now.
[253:40.37]Oh, what the fuck?
[253:41.89]Oh my god, look, talk about free thunder gun.
[253:47.16]That thing is gonna save us.
[253:48.68]See ya later.
[253:50.10]It's gonna be great.
[253:52.52]Okay, what happened?
[253:55.48]This is gonna be great.
[253:57.64]What happened?
[253:58.72]They're coming up, they're coming up!
[254:00.66]If you shoot the crows, it goes... Okay, they're... Whoa!
[254:05.47]Dude, thunder gun on this level is absurd.
[254:07.85]I'm going by.
[254:11.90]It's so bad to be stuck at the end point or the middle point of any of these levels.
[254:16.18]Yeah, it really is.
[254:18.50]We got x2 damage.
[254:19.40]Time to get those points in, lads.
[254:22.72]Time to get those points in, lads.
[254:26.00]Dude, I love this game.
[254:27.54]Remember when Jon Snow said that?
[254:28.86]It's time to get those points in, lads.
[254:41.20]Oh shit.
[254:42.49]Are we waiting here?
[254:43.25]I feel a sudden change in my momentum.
[254:46.93]A sudden change in my momentum.
[254:49.29]I can swing faster.
[254:52.21]Ow.
[254:52.67]Are you just going to hold for a while?
[254:54.87]I was going to hold for a bit.
[254:55.88]Oh, you want to hold it?
[254:57.96]Looks like it's pretty much whenever James wants to go.
[255:00.00]He's got double arm.
[255:00.84]I'm going to get this max ammo here for you guys.
[255:03.08]Let's use it.
[255:03.84]Let's use it.
[255:05.48]Dude, that's actually so good.
[255:06.76]I can use the thunder gun to clear the lane so we can get loot and shit.
[255:10.26]Yeah.
[255:11.36]Time to get those points in, lads.
[255:14.19]There it is again.
[255:17.25]We're getting some good voice line RNG.
[255:18.79]Do we not want to get like, oh wait, this isn't the joke.
[255:22.34]Yeah, we got to keep pushing up.
[255:23.54]We might be able to just reach it if we start buying now.
[255:27.93]Crikey, where you going, dude?
[255:29.85]Oh, we're going up?
[255:30.57]Okay.
[255:30.89]We're almost to the end of the wave.
[255:31.89]We might as well start going up now.
[255:33.51]Alright.
[255:33.99]Who wants to do it?
[255:35.49]James gets first.
[255:36.55]How much further is this route?
[255:38.53]They just don't seem to stop coming.
[255:40.29]I'm not buying any new guns.
[255:43.24]I had like 13,000.
[255:43.64]I should have saved to get the bigger one.
[255:46.46]Yeah, I'll get this one.
[255:49.29]Come on, boys.
[255:49.91]They're gonna start spawning behind us if we don't get up to this corner.
[255:52.31]I just opened the next wave.
[255:53.92]Oh, there you go.
[255:54.44]What is that?
[255:54.90]Oh, they're spawning.
[255:56.26]What is that?
[255:56.74]There's a power-up.
[255:57.94]There's a power-up.
[255:59.78]Get it for your sword.
[256:00.62]Let's just stand here.
[256:01.50]It didn't do anything to the sword.
[256:03.54]That's bad.
[256:04.78]Wait.
[256:05.16]Oh, behind you, behind you, behind you.
[256:06.41]They spawned behind you.
[256:08.65]What is fireworks?
[256:09.37]It's standing like this corner.
[256:10.71]Yeah.
[256:11.73]I'll crouch so you can shoot over me.
[256:13.89]Wait, is that a power-up?
[256:14.81]Fuck, it wasn't.
[256:15.77]We got a nuclear.
[256:16.79]Shame on you.
[256:18.96]Aim on you.
[256:20.08]Yeah, this is a shitty spot to camp because of those ones spawn in the corner.
[256:23.14]We might need to just open up this next one.
[256:24.93]Oh, I can get it.
[256:25.49]Because, like, they all spawn right here.
[256:30.27]Alright.
[256:30.91]James, like, right behind you.
[256:32.01]I'll get the next one.
[256:33.77]Right behind me?
[256:34.69]Yeah, they spawn, like, under you.
[256:36.20]Let's not get the next one yet.
[256:37.14]Let's hold it here for a bit.
[256:38.30]Should we farm?
[256:40.00]Yeah, let's farm, baby.
[256:41.50]Does anyone have a juggernaut?
[256:43.62]No, I think that's the next tier.
[256:44.53]Is it up top?
[256:45.23]Okay.
[256:45.55]I think it's one more door.
[256:47.29]This was really good for farming.
[256:48.33]I remember this.
[256:48.99]I told you we didn't have ammo.
[256:51.93]That was the problem.
[256:52.85]Yeah, I got Thunder Gun this time, so if we get max ammo down there, I can at least clear it.
[256:56.89]So tell me if you see loot down there.
[256:58.03]Yeah, so let him come all the way up then.
[256:59.93]Or, you know, as far up as we can.
[257:01.92]Oh, right there.
[257:04.34]Some points.
[257:05.82]And infinite ammo.
[257:06.68]There you go.
[257:15.47]That's pretty cheap actually.
[257:16.35]The pulse gun.
[257:18.09]That thing's awesome.
[257:19.63]I don't think anything can spawn behind us.
[257:20.85]There's another power-up down here.
[257:21.65]What the hell was that?
[257:23.34]Oh, it was a death gun.
[257:27.40]Yeah!
[257:29.24]I'm just running in the middle now.
[257:31.40]Dude, this fucking blunder gun.
[257:35.02]Alright, we wanna stay here?
[257:36.17]We wanna farm?
[257:36.67]What do you wanna do?
[257:38.01]I think we stay here for a little bit longer, because we have plenty of ammo right now.
[257:41.95]As long as we don't stand any further than where James is, since that's where the enemy is.
[257:47.08]We're good to like just hang out here.
[257:48.38]I can clear it if it gets too dangerous in one hit.
[257:52.36]Nobody spawns behind here, right?
[257:53.27]So it's free money.
[257:54.47]Besides, the more money we make right now, the faster we can just push straight to the top.
[257:57.49]That's true.
[257:58.11]Somebody needs like what?
[258:00.23]13,000 and like 11,000 for the next one to think?
[258:03.71]Yeah.
[258:04.39]That's expensive.
[258:06.89]Oh, there's another Pack-a-Punch.
[258:08.53]Does anyone have a gun?
[258:09.31]Oh, let me Thunder Gun.
[258:10.33]Do yours.
[258:10.75]Yeah, Thunder Gun.
[258:11.63]Alright.
[258:13.80]Oh, God.
[258:14.42]What was that?
[258:14.90]That's lag.
[258:15.12]You get it?
[258:15.76]Yeah, I got it.
[258:16.90]I'm just trying to get past this zombie.
[258:20.36]The Zeus Cannon.
[258:21.46]Wag.
[258:23.14]That shit's strong.
[258:24.83]Oh, it is.
[258:26.25]Yeah, I can, like, clear the entire road with this when we're getting overrun.
[258:30.15]Ooh, they're still bum-rushing through here.
[258:35.11]Oh shit.
[258:36.03]That thing is insane.
[258:38.23]Yeah, it holds like double the ammo too.
[258:44.77]I'm running low on ammo by the way.
[258:47.37]You still have your sword?
[258:48.79]Nope.
[258:48.97]Uh oh.
[258:50.96]This sword actually works pretty well.
[258:52.80]Yeah, it's good if you don't have ammo thing.
[258:54.24]It's great.
[258:55.34]I wish I kept mine.
[258:57.60]Oh, I don't miss mine at all.
[259:03.53]Don't expect me to, like, thunder gun you out of shit, man.
[259:06.79]Oh no!
[259:07.29]I got hit!
[259:08.51]I got you, I got you.
[259:09.77]I'm gonna buy the next thing.
[259:10.87]Yeah, we can go now.
[259:13.24]Yeah, I need ammo.
[259:16.24]Am I down on the ground?
[259:17.18]What the fuck?
[259:18.96]Yeah, watch these spawns.
[259:19.66]Oh god, they're spawning right there!
[259:20.86]Juggernaut.
[259:22.18]Yeah, get this, let's cover here.
[259:24.87]They're spawning on you!
[259:26.05]They're up here, they're up here!
[259:29.83]Oh god!
[259:31.05]Oh god!
[259:35.64]Oh, thank God.
[259:37.18]Come up, come up, come up.
[259:39.10]Yep, follow James.
[259:40.16]Once you get the juggernaut, run.
[259:41.60]I gotta get my juggernaut.
[259:42.92]Come on, I cleared it out.
[259:45.11]I can't go get the juggernaut.
[259:45.93]10,000.
[259:46.19]I'll die.
[259:47.25]I'll die.
[259:49.19]I'll get it.
[259:51.75]God, I'm glad I still have ammo for this thing.
[259:55.41]We're gonna do it.
[259:56.81]Keep going up.
[259:57.57]I can't get it.
[259:58.17]Keep going up.
[259:58.79]We wait here.
[260:02.50]We camp here.
[260:03.49]Yep.
[260:04.49]11,000.
[260:07.19]I'm going to save all mine.
[260:09.63]There's a gun here, too, so if we absolutely need it, there's something we can buy.
[260:15.16]I'm putting my thunder gun away for a bit to make some cash.
[260:17.38]Yep.
[260:19.98]So, James, tell me if you're getting really low on health, okay?
[260:22.88]Yes.
[260:24.70]Oh, there you go.
[260:25.80]Infinite ammo.
[260:28.22]Thunder gun out, baby.
[260:29.70]Insta-kill.
[260:32.84]Alright, save your... Oh, there.
[260:34.66]It's infinite right now, so... Oh, it's so... Yeah, this is way easier.
[260:44.33]I could go get the Juggernaut.
[260:45.51]I'm going for it.
[260:46.07]I'm going to... Save me.
[260:47.31]Protect me.
[260:47.69]I'm going to get by Juggernaut.
[260:48.99]He's going down for it.
[260:50.33]It's okay.
[260:50.61]I'll come with him.
[260:51.45]Good.
[260:51.61]Let's go.
[260:54.67]You got insta-kill, so you should be okay.
[260:56.53]Alright, infinite ammo is over.
[260:57.51]Infinite ammo is over.
[260:58.85]Yep.
[261:01.26]Beautiful.
[261:01.90]Thank you.
[261:06.24]That's up.
[261:06.58]You guys are standing a little bit ahead of the spawn point for the zombies on this link.
[261:14.34]Oh, what the fuck?
[261:19.82]I still don't know what the fuck fireworks even does for my sword.
[261:25.33]Ow!
[261:25.83]Ow!
[261:30.37]I wonder what's... Where's the end?
[261:32.59]Is it the next two more after this or what?
[261:34.48]It's got to be like pretty much where we were, I think, by the looks of it.
[261:38.40]Oh, double points.
[261:39.02]Do it, do it, do it.
[261:40.74]Push for it.
[261:42.00]Time to get those points in, lads.
[261:45.76]Let's get those points in, lads.
[261:47.46]Get those points in, lads.
[261:51.41]I have like 15 rounds left, so we're going through them pretty quick right now.
[261:55.17]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[261:56.69]What happened here?
[261:58.07]I'll get you up.
[261:58.51]I'll get you up.
[262:00.05]Wait, what?
[262:00.53]Is that down there?
[262:01.33]Did I get too overzealous?
[262:02.19]You're going to need to get juggernaut again now.
[262:07.29]Oh, fuck me, I do.
[262:08.73]I'm so bad.
[262:11.13]I'm going for it.
[262:12.10]Not yet.
[262:12.48]I'll go with you.
[262:13.10]No, don't go and die.
[262:14.86]That's a bad idea.
[262:15.62]I don't know if it's... Oh, God.
[262:18.38]Oh, God.
[262:18.74]What the fuck happened?
[262:19.46]Get back a little bit.
[262:22.10]Get slow-mo.
[262:22.58]Get slow-mo.
[262:24.06]Help me push for it!
[262:25.84]We got it, okay.
[262:26.82]I'm almost out of Thunder Gun ammo.
[262:28.36]Heads up, I got 12 rounds left, which isn't a lot considering how many I had when we started.
[262:32.02]That's not gonna happen.
[262:33.72]We're walking away.
[262:34.60]We should go up.
[262:35.25]Infinite ammo?
[262:36.83]We got it, yeah, alright.
[262:39.05]Let's get you, Juggernaut, now.
[262:40.73]Let's go, go, go, go, go!
[262:43.57]Oh my god.
[262:46.09]Get it!
[262:47.23]Is everyone good on Juggernaut?
[262:49.14]Let's go.
[262:50.42]Come back up.
[262:51.02]They're spawning back up here again.
[262:53.38]What's happening?
[262:54.36]This sword is taking a lot more.
[262:56.08]What's going on?
[262:57.76]Let's open this.
[262:58.76]I'll get the next one.
[263:00.96]Alright, we're good.
[263:02.00]Everyone head on up.
[263:02.86]We're getting to the top now.
[263:07.24]Why are these doors so expensive?
[263:10.14]I don't know.
[263:11.10]One more.
[263:11.74]One more.
[263:12.00]Who has enough?
[263:12.70]I have enough.
[263:13.44]17 grand.
[263:13.96]There it is.
[263:14.50]15.
[263:14.52]Dragons.
[263:14.84]Wait, what the fuck?
[263:17.80]Is it friendly?
[263:24.38]They're going to be coming up here.
[263:26.38]Yeah, they are coming up here, aren't they?
[263:28.08]From what direction?
[263:29.40]Bye, guys.
[263:30.56]I'm going to cancel black.
[263:32.40]Well, he left, which means he's, I think, at the bottom of the thing alone.
[263:39.38]Wait.
[263:40.12]I think he went to the bottom.
[263:41.87]I got 60 seconds to pack my stuff.
[263:43.51]What the fuck's happening?
[263:45.09]Oh, it's the pack-a-punch.
[263:47.53]Oh.
[263:48.09]Oh, fuck.
[263:48.81]I did not think this through.
[263:51.11]Alright.
[263:51.65]I don't have enough money for any of this.
[263:56.75]We should get, we should get a crawler out of this out of the 56 left.
[264:00.92]Yeah.
[264:02.76]I'm pretty much out of Zeus ammo, so I'm not going to use it much anymore.
[264:05.54]Heads up.
[264:05.88]Alright.
[264:07.94]How many left?
[264:08.46]47?
[264:08.48]47.
[264:08.58]I don't know if any spawned by Criken.
[264:12.62]It's nice over here, by the way.
[264:14.25]Just saying.
[264:16.63]I'm definitely totally down with that.
[264:18.82]I don't know.
[264:19.28]Abandon us and basically fuck you guys as you went down the elevator.
[264:23.30]Kill the dragon?
[264:25.58]What?
[264:27.14]Kill the dragon?
[264:28.40]It is flying pretty close to us right now.
[264:31.81]Alright, we're at like 39 left.
[264:35.13]We should start trying to make a crawler.
[264:37.35]Okay.
[264:38.97]Are they still down here?
[264:40.05]I don't have any more nades.
[264:41.73]I have four, so.
[264:43.75]Whoa, what the fuck?
[264:45.28]What just happened?
[264:47.08]It took my, all that happened there was it took my juggernaut because I didn't leave fast enough.
[264:51.74]Why are we watching you come back up?
[264:53.02]What's happening?
[264:53.80]Yeah, we're watching you.
[264:56.94]Okay, well, where's the, I'm going to make a crawler out of one of these white walkers that's coming up.
[265:05.76]What an unexplainable encounter.
[265:08.52]Is there any... Oh!
[265:09.56]There's a max ammo over here!
[265:11.90]A free one!
[265:12.88]Tomato Shaker.
[265:13.56]I wouldn't take it yet.
[265:15.15]Actually, I'm pretty low on Zeus Cannon.
[265:16.67]We might as well.
[265:17.47]Yeah, that's what I figured you'd get it for.
[265:18.69]What the fuck just happened now?
[265:19.99]The teleporting... Winter is coming.
[265:22.07]Now he doesn't have the ammo!
[265:23.49]I know, we don't have ammo!
[265:24.79]I got it, I got it.
[265:25.93]I'm with us.
[265:27.47]Wait, laser beams.
[265:28.77]How do we get through this?
[265:29.39]I think we have to fight the dragon.
[265:32.31]Oh, fuck.
[265:32.77]There it is!
[265:33.91]What the fuck?
[265:34.65]I'm hitting it with the... What is this, dude?
[265:37.67]This is crazy.
[265:39.31]I don't think we can kill it.
[265:40.81]Shoot it in the chest.
[265:43.55]Oh!
[265:43.95]Oh my god!
[265:45.30]Ah!
[265:46.12]We can't be here!
[265:47.34]Fire!
[265:48.88]There's another Max Ammo.
[265:51.30]Oh, there... We're locked in here.
[265:52.68]Don't take that Max Ammo yet.
[265:54.46]I'm not.
[265:55.40]It's like a sequence.
[265:56.66]There are...
[265:58.19]Watch out, Criken, behind you.
[265:59.96]Don't kill all those zombies.
[266:00.92]It's gonna start the next wave.
[266:02.24]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[266:05.96]No.
[266:06.54]Dude, I'm trying to get away from it, man.
[266:08.94]I'm trying.
[266:12.48]I'm down.
[266:13.94]No, no.
[266:14.94]There's seven more.
[266:16.80]No.
[266:18.70]Criken.
[266:20.04]Tomato.
[266:22.04]I don't think I like dancing in this map.
[266:26.64]Now at least we know how the show ends.
[266:27.90]Is that seven?
[266:28.74]One, two, three, four, five.
[266:29.90]That's like 30.
[266:30.46]I don't have to pay my HBO subscription.
[266:32.51]I know how it ends.
[266:33.39]We already know.
[266:34.35]No!
[266:37.23]That's not seven.
[266:38.15]This is not seven.
[266:41.23]I'm a little bit disappointed that we didn't manage to do a single damage on the dragon.
[266:44.27]We didn't do one damage on him.
[266:45.89]We did one damage.
[266:47.13]I don't see anything on his bar.
[266:48.19]It looks like we didn't do any damage.
[266:49.97]It's alright.
[266:50.41]We'll be okay.
[266:51.63]James, you could probably res me if you ran over to me fast enough.
[266:53.97]I think they're burning.
[266:54.95]They are so fast.
[266:57.52]I believe in you because you're faster, James.
[267:01.12]Take out those six.
[267:01.66]There's only six.
[267:02.80]What's the problem?
[267:05.30]There's only six left, James.
[267:07.08]There's only six left, dude.
[267:08.83]There's only five now.
[267:11.89]They just spawned on top.
[267:14.83]Why'd you tell me to do that?
[267:17.66]I'm sorry, James.
[267:18.86]I guess I'll leave now.
[267:23.46]Let me get up right there after that.
[267:27.00]Hey, I mean...
[267:28.12]They made a level about Game of Thrones.
[267:30.45]That was pretty cool.
[267:30.91]That was pretty good.
[267:31.37]I mean, the dragon, custom dragon model, got a hand in it.
[267:35.97]Yeah, that was a real one.
[267:37.53]It liked that.
[267:39.85]Did you hear that at the end?
[267:41.68]Yeah.
[267:42.88]It's been... Oh, I thought that was one of you guys.
[267:47.04]No, that wasn't us.
[267:47.80]That was the map.
[267:48.84]No, that was a good map.
[267:49.76]That wasn't just like T-posing Bowser in the corner.
[267:53.40]Speaking of T-Posing Closer, let's do Five Nights at Freddy's next.
[267:58.17]Oh, God.
[267:58.69]That's the jump scare one.
[267:59.55]Yeah, let's do that.
[268:00.35]Oh, hell yeah.
[268:04.19]This one actually has jump scares in it.
[268:06.25]This is going to be a scary one.
[268:10.29]It might be scary.
[268:11.81]Warning you.
[268:15.91]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[268:23.19]By the killer?
[268:24.99]SB the killer?
[268:27.11]Gonna put a face cam off of this one?
[268:28.29]Yeah, that's true.
[268:35.05]Not for me, guys.
[268:37.82]You know, I haven't done a face reveal yet.
[268:49.94]Someone's got a lot of graphics.
[268:51.40]It's, uh...
[268:52.99]We didn't ask, Smile.
[268:55.11]Okay.
[268:56.95]This one's loading in a lot of vertices and polygons.
[269:01.65]He's got a lot going on.
[269:02.67]I think I got kicked out.
[269:04.96]I got kicked out.
[269:06.32]You got kicked?
[269:07.60]I got kicked out.
[269:08.46]Did you not install this one?
[269:11.14]I installed the pack.
[269:12.48]I mean, was it in the pack?
[269:15.82]It should be in the pack, right?
[269:16.80]Oh, it's in the pack.
[269:17.56]Alright.
[269:18.34]Oh, it's in the pack.
[269:20.38]What the heck happened?
[269:23.81]It still says I'm in your game too.
[269:26.11]It's still loading for me.
[269:27.39]I'm not sure how much dev of this map possibly put in that it should still be loading for me.
[269:35.52]Yeah, I'm wondering that too.
[269:37.38]How much lore did they jam pack into this level?
[269:40.41]Do you think the reason there's no ratings
[269:43.36]Is it because it's shit?
[269:44.38]Well, I knew that.
[269:45.38]Is there another file?
[269:46.75]I warned you.
[269:47.39]I didn't know it was unplayable shit.
[269:50.35]If it's in my solo list, that means I have it, right?
[269:53.69]Yeah, it should be.
[269:54.91]Okay, well then, yeah, I have it.
[269:56.81]Hang on.
[269:57.17]While this is loading, because it's obviously still loading the game, I'm going to take a trip to the actual page.
[270:04.14]Take a gander.
[270:05.06]Five nights.
[270:06.58]Five nights.
[270:08.38]At Freddy's Zombies.
[270:10.81]And the first comment I see is, where the pack a punch?
[270:15.85]Okay, that's good.
[270:17.20]Someone's got in the game.
[270:20.46]Wait, somebody got in game?
[270:21.62]What are some of these?
[270:24.12]Best map, been waiting for a FNAF map.
[270:28.55]It doesn't seem like people are having issues playing it.
[270:30.71]Very fun, they say, says Falcon.
[270:34.50]My loading screen seems to be frozen.
[270:36.02]Yeah, I'm going to force it closed.
[270:38.80]James, do you want to launch it on your own and see if we can get into it?
[270:41.98]If I can get into it?
[270:43.04]If it even works?
[270:44.56]Yeah, I can do that.
[270:46.22]Meaty bun yells, yeah!
[270:48.46]What if it jump scares me when I get in?
[270:51.77]Yeah!
[270:53.67]Lower your volume because it could do the...
[270:58.95]Oh, I'm gonna get scared.
[271:01.39]There better not be any jump scares, says Misty Fize.
[271:06.73]I am in.
[271:07.47]It did work.
[271:08.69]Oh, you got in?
[271:09.43]Okay.
[271:11.87]I'm gonna join on James.
[271:14.03]It actually doesn't even look that bad.
[271:15.43]So can you join off?
[271:17.09]Should I just join off?
[271:18.41]I'm in a solo game.
[271:19.47]I'm not even looking online.
[271:20.58]I guess I can try hosting it again.
[271:22.40]I mean, I don't know if James can get in.
[271:23.70]What the fuck?
[271:24.96]You get scared?
[271:25.60]You get scared?
[271:27.88]I'll let you guys see this.
[271:29.14]Don't tell us.
[271:29.68]Don't spoil it.
[271:30.64]Yeah, I won't spoil it.
[271:31.54]Oh, I'm getting excited.
[271:34.22]Can you get in my lobby?
[271:37.60]Can you get in my lobby?
[271:39.37]Close this.
[271:41.15]Oh, boy.
[271:43.35]I almost blue screened, I think.
[271:44.61]Alright, I'm going to try to join off you, Criken.
[271:50.61]Okay.
[271:53.63]Once you're in there.
[271:54.13]James, did you get my invite?
[271:55.41]Can you...
[271:56.49]Uh, I just hit game over now, so it's gotta like load me out of here.
[272:04.79]I don't know if it worked before when I tried to connect to you.
[272:07.69]Yeah, I mean, we might as well see when there's no one else in my lobby yet.
[272:12.19]Says join.
[272:13.09]I can join.
[272:14.07]Maybe.
[272:16.85]Are you in a, uh, in a game right now, Dragon?
[272:20.05]Uh, I'm loading in the menu.
[272:22.68]You should hear my voice just kind of get super loud any second.
[272:26.52]No, no, it's already been there.
[272:28.14]Oh, now.
[272:30.08]Already been there.
[272:32.34]Well, James still can't join me, so.
[272:35.02]Didn't work.
[272:36.22]I don't get why we're not friends.
[272:37.80]What did I do?
[272:38.60]What about Five Nights at Freddy's?
[272:40.08]Man, we're just not compatible.
[272:41.74]Two.
[272:42.50]The good one.
[272:45.20]Which one was that one?
[272:45.78]Five Nights at Freddy's 5?
[272:46.46]I'm going to cry again.
[272:49.03]No, it was the one with all of them, dude.
[272:50.77]The one with all of them.
[272:51.71]Oh, it was all of them.
[272:52.63]God damn it.
[272:52.95]Yeah, there's like an ultimate Five Nights at Freddy's that has all of them.
[272:58.05]I guess we'll just join Criken again and see if this time... Yeah, do it again.
[273:01.91]I'm gonna fix my mic.
[273:05.25]Press join game, see if we get it.
[273:13.04]I love it when my mic gets all quiet and everyone's like, where'd he go?
[273:16.74]You know?
[273:18.74]Lobby is not joinable.
[273:19.98]What are you talking about?
[273:23.02]I was all tapping.
[273:24.68]Alright, guys.
[273:25.24]Come on, come on, come on.
[273:29.53]I'm in.
[273:33.11]Alright.
[273:35.09]Now, it's time to spend Five Nights at Freddy's.
[273:40.34]Be careful, don't get scared.
[273:41.16]I'll give it five minutes at Freddy's and then we're switching to Monopoly.
[273:44.84]Oh!
[273:45.12]You guys are going to be really excited about this one.
[273:47.22]From what I saw, it looks like a good one.
[273:49.70]You know, I thought it was called Friday Nights at Freddy's for about two years.
[273:54.49]What?
[273:54.89]Friday Nights at Freddy's.
[273:56.77]Yeah.
[273:57.31]Just the Fridays.
[273:58.85]Friday's Pizza Night.
[273:59.69]I was like, yeah, it's a pizza place.
[274:02.17]I mean, that wouldn't be wrong.
[274:04.51]Right?
[274:05.43]Yeah, I mean, you spend, what, a week there?
[274:07.83]You'd spend at least one of those days.
[274:09.03]One of them's Friday.
[274:09.68]Okay.
[274:10.26]At least one on this Friday.
[274:11.16]Probably.
[274:11.52]Unless you start on a Saturday.
[274:13.60]Sunday.
[274:14.07]In which case, you'd probably get off right before Friday.
[274:16.41]That's true.
[274:17.91]You somehow skip the Friday.
[274:20.01]You skip Friday.
[274:23.57]I think we've reached the same spot as last time.
[274:26.69]Oh my god, it did it again.
[274:28.35]Yeah.
[274:29.77]I think the only way that we make this work is that James hosts, we join on James, because he's the only one that's confirmed has a usable map version of this.
[274:38.53]How the fuck?
[274:39.41]Tricky, tricky, tricky stuff.
[274:40.97]Is there anything I need to change under the private game?
[274:43.63]No, but Criken does need to, Criken needs to release us like spirits, so he has to close his game to release us so we don't have to restart.
[274:51.51]Yeah, you're released.
[274:52.67]Go forth.
[274:53.27]Prosper.
[274:54.75]I still have the game up, I guess.
[274:57.91]It'll release us in a moment.
[274:59.36]Oh, no.
[274:59.64]I'm stuck forever.
[275:01.94]No, trust it.
[275:02.70]Trust it.
[275:04.80]God, I hope they make more board game maps.
[275:06.32]I don't give a shit about any of this.
[275:07.34]I just want, like, Nazi zombie Yahtzee.
[275:09.56]Yahtzee.
[275:09.98]I want them to cover everything.
[275:14.46]It's like RNG based where you keep rolling the dice.
[275:17.08]The Monopoly one does have rolling.
[275:19.02]I know that.
[275:19.82]I'm almost positive.
[275:22.34]You pay like 500 bucks and it rolls the dice for you.
[275:25.37]Yahtzee zombies.
[275:29.03]That's pretty good.
[275:31.85]How is it not there yet?
[275:33.19]That's perfect.
[275:34.35]Come on, someone.
[275:34.97]Hop to it.
[275:36.09]Wait a minute.
[275:37.56]Let me look it up.
[275:38.56]A friend of mine recently turned 24, and he said what he did for his birthday is he played Yahtzee.
[275:47.39]That was his activity.
[275:48.85]That's not bad.
[275:49.89]Yeah, you know, it's a good night.
[275:51.09]It's a good game.
[275:51.95]It's a fun game.
[275:52.59]You just dice around and shake it up in the container.
[275:54.69]It makes the cool, satisfying noise.
[275:57.98]Maybe you get him right.
[275:58.60]Maybe you get him wrong.
[276:00.28]Oh, mother of God.
[276:04.68]Alright, so.
[276:05.34]Well, it finally released me from my torment.
[276:10.68]It released us from our torment.
[276:16.29]You want to play a game?
[276:17.77]Stop, dude.
[276:18.87]I don't leave my mic peaked when I do the bit.
[276:22.30]You know, that's the thing with the bit is that I turn it down after.
[276:27.09]Alright, James, let's see if you have a major problem.
[276:30.91]It should be up.
[276:31.97]I guess if Criken wants to join in first, I guess he could.
[276:35.91]No, I think I'll join in because I'm your friend on Steam.
[276:38.87]Holy shit, it worked.
[276:39.99]Look at that.
[276:40.45]I'm finished with you saying that we're not friends.
[276:44.53]Are we good?
[276:44.87]Do we actually get in?
[276:46.35]Do you have James on Steam?
[276:47.73]No, I don't have that friend.
[276:49.73]Yikes, man.
[276:50.55]Okay.
[276:51.49]I have like two people on Steam.
[276:54.37]The rest is like 7,000 notifications from when I used to play Team Fortress.
[277:03.56]Turn up your mic again.
[277:04.44]How do you keep turning it down too low?
[277:06.64]Like, you should remember what it's at.
[277:08.02]No, it's automatic.
[277:09.54]First it goes full volume, and then it goes to 60.
[277:12.53]And I turn it back up to 90.
[277:13.57]I'm joining off you, Criken.
[277:14.91]Hopefully you're in there.
[277:16.87]Oh, he's in!
[277:18.89]Dude, let's play this Five Nights at Freddy's.
[277:21.67]Five Nights.
[277:22.49]Seven.
[277:23.43]Six.
[277:24.41]Five.
[277:25.39]Four.
[277:30.81]How the fuck does that make any sense that it would have to be me as host to fucking get it to load up?
[277:34.34]I don't know.
[277:35.24]Well, I mean, all I know is that you're the only person of the four of us that loaded the map and got in it, you know?
[277:40.10]Okay, wait.
[277:40.76]How many of us here has done a Five Nights at Freddy's video?
[277:43.76]I have...
[277:45.26]I have.
[277:45.90]Was this a trap?
[277:47.46]I'm putting my hand back down.
[277:49.28]I technically didn't.
[277:49.98]You technically did?
[277:51.61]I did not.
[277:52.33]I'm the only one.
[277:53.43]I'm the only one that this is a new experience for me.
[277:55.81]I didn't make it.
[277:56.41]I mean, I've seen the game and I've played it in a video.
[277:59.77]Oh, okay.
[278:01.25]I had connections back when Five Nights at Freddy's came out.
[278:03.42]I got early access to the second game and the third game.
[278:06.32]Oh, shit.
[278:06.68]You know that guy?
[278:07.56]The guy that made it?
[278:08.98]I didn't know the guy that made it, but I knew a guy that knew the guy that made it.
[278:12.46]Am I in or crashed?
[278:13.36]I think I might be crashed.
[278:15.95]Yeah, I don't think it worked for me.
[278:17.07]I think I'm probably the problem child.
[278:21.43]Maybe this is only a single player map because I don't remember there being four other like schmucks in Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[278:26.50]It also got stuck again for me too.
[278:28.32]It just says awaiting textures.
[278:30.02]Maybe this isn't multiplayer.
[278:31.46]Maybe we have to settle for Monopoly.
[278:35.92]He said, but I got to turn the webcam off.
[278:37.88]Sorry, guys.
[278:38.60]He said Monopoly.
[278:40.29]I mean I could get other scary levels I I did I picked some like actual good spook levels oh yeah like there's zombie dollhouse which is creepy clowns and shit I like clowns though there's cheese pick any game with cheese in the name and that's gonna be scary uh simpson zombies Minecraft challenge
[279:03.80]Do I have to reboot the fucking game?
[279:05.90]Yeah, you have to release us, James.
[279:07.54]Okay.
[279:08.96]Ooh, alien isolation zombies.
[279:11.74]Oh, that was one I uninstalled because I wasn't sure.
[279:14.72]It wasn't actually very big, that map.
[279:16.06]It's pretty small.
[279:16.86]Is it some kind of currency thing?
[279:18.68]Oh, my God.
[279:19.12]I actually can't get out of this at all.
[279:20.68]What the fuck?
[279:21.14]Dude, release us.
[279:22.55]I had to end the process.
[279:23.83]You have to, like, yeah, I had to fucking go to task manager.
[279:26.79]Oops.
[279:27.45]Please release us.
[279:28.63]Okay.
[279:29.15]Now, counterpoint.
[279:30.13]What about zombies and cars, Mario Kart edition?
[279:32.95]Let's do it.
[279:34.22]That one actually has built-in cars.
[279:35.62]The cars work.
[279:36.30]Yeah.
[279:36.54]The cars work.
[279:37.92]The cars work.
[279:38.92]Working cars.
[279:40.10]Well, the cars work.
[279:42.04]James, have you released us?
[279:43.72]It's closed.
[279:44.24]Yeah, I closed it.
[279:46.08]Alright.
[279:46.58]Smooth clarity seconds.
[279:47.70]I'm free.
[279:48.18]There we go.
[279:50.76]I'm sorry that had to happen to you.
[279:52.97]The working cars does sound pretty good.
[279:54.39]Sounds pretty cool.
[279:54.79]Yeah, that's the only reason I clicked add it to collection was I saw working cars.
[279:59.31]I don't even think they had working because in Call of Duty, so...
[280:02.96]That's an instant letter grade up, no matter what game it is.
[280:05.14]Yeah, they made features that weren't in Call of Duty Black Ops.
[280:10.50]That's impressive.
[280:13.88]I hope it works.
[280:14.75]Zombies and cars.
[280:17.01]I hope it launches.
[280:18.33]Dude, there's going to be so many LOL moments.
[280:20.41]If you can run the zombies with the cars, oh, my God.
[280:23.71]It'll be yellow moments everywhere.
[280:26.46]This is the best one.
[280:27.36]A little bit of education for you, Jeremy.
[280:29.46]We call them LPBs, alright?
[280:31.82]Laughs per bit.
[280:34.25]So you're going to want to track your LPBs.
[280:36.31]Every time you do a bit, you're going to want to get a counter up.
[280:38.73]Every time you see a laugh, you'll know if it was a good bit or not.
[280:41.98]It's important to report this stuff accurately to our shareholders or else we're going to get shut down.
[280:47.90]So, you know, keep it written down somewhere, please.
[280:53.33]I've been keeping track for years.
[280:55.83]Thanks.
[280:56.43]Awesome.
[280:57.79]Wire the doc to us after.
[280:59.97]What's your top tier?
[281:00.83]What's the earner?
[281:02.59]Was the big earner?
[281:03.69]Yeah.
[281:04.41]When I said shpee a few months ago.
[281:07.25]Shpee?
[281:07.86]Yeah.
[281:08.74]That got the biggest LPB rating?
[281:10.20]Oh yeah, it was huge.
[281:11.64]Wow.
[281:12.64]And for so little effort too.
[281:14.32]Yeah, it's just a simple word.
[281:15.94]It was really easy.
[281:18.30]That's great return.
[281:19.24]Let's do a sequel.
[281:20.72]I don't think we've managed to corner the single word silly voice audience yet, Criken is the problem.
[281:25.85]We haven't really gotten that audience.
[281:30.29]My chat's all freaking out when they heard that.
[281:32.89]My chat's... They can't have enough of it.
[281:36.28]Dude, this guy's poaching our fucking bits for a second.
[281:40.06]Right now.
[281:41.24]Come to me.
[281:42.18]Come to me.
[281:42.88]Come to me.
[281:44.32]Cut him out.
[281:44.95]Cut him out.
[281:47.47]Our stocks are falling to bits.
[281:49.59]He's crashing us.
[281:57.08]I want this one.
[281:57.84]This is the one.
[281:58.42]Which card?
[281:58.78]This is the one.
[281:59.57]This is the one.
[282:00.23]Oh, it's the +2 letter grade.
[282:05.49]I'm going.
[282:06.79]Five left.
[282:08.07]This is the best one.
[282:09.76]What the fuck is this?
[282:10.94]How do you turn?
[282:13.44]Turn with your mouse.
[282:14.70]Oh, you turn with your mouse?
[282:15.64]You can't even run him over.
[282:17.00]You turn with the mouse.
[282:19.62]Dude, I'm taking, like, boosts and shit.
[282:22.48]Here we go.
[282:22.98]Why did the music start and stop right away?
[282:25.45]Wait, what the fuck?
[282:26.29]I can't even try.
[282:27.27]Mamma mia.
[282:28.59]I'll see you guys at the finish line.
[282:31.69]Music.
[282:31.85]Oh, it's only with the mouse.
[282:33.71]What?
[282:34.21]Whoa.
[282:34.99]Hey.
[282:35.87]There's a wall.
[282:38.27]The music is on for, like, very limited amounts of time.
[282:41.65]Wait, do we have to fight the zombies now?
[282:42.79]I think we have to get out.
[282:44.51]Hang on, I'm getting... Oh, I fell through the... Oh, the car's crushing me.
[282:48.98]I think you just ran me over.
[282:50.12]Wait, we need 5,000 points.
[282:52.74]No, you can't run them over.
[282:54.72]You can't.
[282:56.00]Okay.
[282:56.74]We, like, sandwiched them.
[282:58.56]So we have to run them over?
[283:00.54]Why can I not run them over?
[283:02.56]There's insta-kill.
[283:03.36]There's an insta-kill.
[283:04.34]Insta-kill.
[283:05.64]We have to pay the toll?
[283:07.08]I'm down.
[283:07.98]How do you die with a car to protect you?
[283:12.42]I wasn't in my car.
[283:13.70]Double points.
[283:15.28]Double points.
[283:15.88]Imagine getting out of your car.
[283:18.37]I got, I pack-a-punched my car, I think.
[283:22.81]Is that pack-a-punch for everybody?
[283:24.11]I think everybody got that pack-a-punch.
[283:25.93]Criken!
[283:27.11]Criken, mother of God, what happened to you?
[283:29.80]I can't get you up because I have a war machine.
[283:32.35]I'm going to do this in your ear until it's gone.
[283:34.37]There's a zombie behind you.
[283:37.13]Pick me up.
[283:38.05]Get me up.
[283:38.45]For the love of God.
[283:39.43]Ignore him.
[283:40.41]Help me.
[283:40.91]Why are you still picking me up?
[283:42.31]James.
[283:43.81]James.
[283:44.45]You're alright.
[283:46.45]James.
[283:47.15]James?
[283:56.04]What's up?
[283:57.06]I'm gonna need a hand.
[283:58.40]Why do we have these kind of guns?
[284:01.82]James is running out the clock so he can win the race, man.
[284:04.74]He's playing to win, guys.
[284:06.48]I can win the race?
[284:07.46]How do I win the race?
[284:08.44]Well, I mean, first you gotta help us because we gotta pay for the next checkpoint.
[284:12.40]Is this gun not working?
[284:15.12]There's a lot more still spawning here.
[284:17.00]Well, I mean, just come get me anyways.
[284:19.76]Why were there bullets coming out of these guns?
[284:21.56]How is this a race if we also have to fight?
[284:23.22]Oh, God!
[284:23.44]I went out the wrong way!
[284:25.32]Hey, get me.
[284:26.56]Jerm is not going to make it.
[284:27.92]I mean, what?
[284:28.36]I can't.
[284:29.02]See?
[284:29.32]It didn't work.
[284:30.30]No, dude.
[284:30.66]Come on.
[284:31.46]Hold on.
[284:31.74]Hold on.
[284:32.00]I'll be back.
[284:32.42]I'll be back.
[284:32.86]I'll come back for you.
[284:34.90]I'm gone.
[284:35.62]I died instantly when you left.
[284:38.57]That's what I meant was that we were both about to kill over.
[284:42.19]It's not even Mario.
[284:43.21]You're not even a Mario Kart character.
[284:44.70]You gotta go find it.
[284:45.70]It's got the music though.
[284:51.38]Man, that made me feel like shit hearing that meme.
[284:55.37]I feel like I won.
[284:56.39]Look at the PNG of the Mario's in the audience.
[284:59.39]What the fuck?
[285:01.49]What's up with this hive mind of Mario's?
[285:06.21]I want to go again.
[285:07.03]I think we can do this.
[285:07.91]Yeah, let's go again.
[285:09.17]Let's see if this crashes.
[285:10.35]It does.
[285:11.03]It does.
[285:11.81]Hey!
[285:12.75]Alright.
[285:13.70]You know how easy it is to do on the piano?
[285:18.12]How easy is it to do on the piano?
[285:20.96]You go up three keys, you go down three keys.
[285:24.40]Go impress your friends.
[285:25.04]Can you do that?
[285:26.23]If I had a keyboard, I could do it.
[285:27.95]F-G-H-H-G-F.
[285:29.97]Get a digital one.
[285:30.77]Use the digital keyboard.
[285:33.35]Website.
[285:34.24]Okay.
[285:34.42]Alright.
[285:34.78]Yeah, I'll get it right now.
[285:36.14]Play it.
[285:37.32]I'm going to play it right now.
[285:39.36]Okay.
[285:40.08]Here we go.
[285:41.32]You have to watch my stream, though.
[285:42.52]Because I can't pull it through here.
[285:47.66]Just turn it up.
[285:48.74]Just turn it up really loud.
[285:49.66]I'll hear you.
[285:50.26]I'm going to turn it up really loud.
[285:51.66]I'm going to lean into the mic.
[285:54.88]Can you hear it?
[285:57.88]Louder.
[285:59.50]Oh, I hear it.
[286:01.22]Ready?
[286:01.94]Ready?
[286:09.59]Never mind.
[286:16.58]What?
[286:17.02]Wait, what do you mean?
[286:17.96]Never mind.
[286:20.55]I guess it wasn't the tune.
[286:22.19]Did you just realize it was wrong?
[286:24.99]It's different.
[286:25.71]The tone goes a little.
[286:30.89]I'm opening the game bag up.
[286:31.93]What an elaborate fucking bit.
[286:36.53]I thought it was da-da-da, da-da-da, right?
[286:39.85]It's not.
[286:42.09]It's a little different than that.
[286:46.86]Oh, he's LPB farming.
[286:48.30]He's stealing our shards.
[286:58.28]I got too excited about all those new comedy people.
[287:02.72]Comedy people.
[287:05.42]Wait, how am I in your lobby, but you're not actually in the lobby?
[287:09.30]Why are you in my lobby?
[287:10.32]I thought you were hosting.
[287:12.51]Let's turn on Black Ops 3 multiplayer, please.
[287:14.67]Yeah, I got really excited really fast, and sometimes I get a little worked up.
[287:18.45]It's okay.
[287:19.55]Yeah, it's alright.
[287:22.22]You know what's honestly the most jarring thing we could possibly do at this point?
[287:24.84]Play an actual Call of Duty Black Ops 3 zombie level and just see how fucking shit every other one is.
[287:29.91]I'd rather fucking die.
[287:31.65]Honestly, I can't even go back now at this point.
[287:34.13]I never started to begin with.
[287:35.17]You think I can do that ever?
[287:36.69]This is your only experience.
[287:38.81]This is the only experience.
[287:40.95]It's like, imagine all these levels, but they jam-packed about 20,000 times more needless complexity into zombies, like for every actual level.
[287:51.52]There's like a billion different things you're supposed to do.
[287:54.44]A thousand Easter eggs.
[287:56.28]Every map is supposed to last like four months.
[287:59.05]It's insane and awful, honestly.
[288:03.74]Are there people that play zombies in it?
[288:05.12]Yeah, haven't some levels, they just, they marathon last forever?
[288:10.03]They last forever, and some levels might as well be like small cities at this point.
[288:15.21]One of them, the first one in this game actually is a small city.
[288:19.55]You have to take a fucking bus to get to spots of it.
[288:23.61]It's like a, it's like transit.
[288:25.65]It's more chores, it's more chores than taking trams than it is playing the level.
[288:30.71]Oh my god.
[288:32.71]Imagine that.
[288:35.46]Oh, we are doing this again.
[288:37.18]Right.
[288:37.46]Okay.
[288:37.84]I forgot.
[288:40.16]So someday, Gemma, when you're in a conversation with someone at a party and they're like, oh, I love Nazis.
[288:43.78]Play it.
[288:44.66]And you have to think.
[288:45.90]You have to think to yourself, how do I answer this?
[288:49.80]I play the zombies in Mario Kart version.
[288:52.30]How do you relate to it?
[288:54.58]I can just pretend.
[288:55.50]I can be like, yeah.
[288:56.82]Because I know about the boxes and buying and stuff.
[288:59.76]I'm first.
[289:00.04]I'm first.
[289:00.30]I'm first.
[289:02.18]No, you're not anymore, boy.
[289:03.58]What?
[289:06.38]Dude, I totally screwed you over.
[289:09.26]Oh, this sounds awful.
[289:11.60]Why is my engine stuttering like this?
[289:17.16]Damn it, I was gonna knock you off the road, man.
[289:20.49]I knew there was a turn coming up.
[289:22.67]I couldn't do that forever.
[289:23.99]I love how the music's so temporary.
[289:26.23]What the fuck?
[289:27.61]I mean, we have to make money.
[289:28.75]We can't even open this until we make some money.
[289:33.91]I found something.
[289:34.87]Alright everyone, let's make some money.
[289:36.85]At the beginning of the level, there's something back here.
[289:41.10]Jesus Christ.
[289:42.48]Why'd that zombie jump at us so fast?
[289:43.74]I knew you were gonna be fine.
[289:46.86]I mean, we should never be caught because we can run.
[289:49.02]There's so much space to run.
[289:56.83]Somebody just said this looks like a shitty mobile game.
[290:02.97]I wanna like the 4,000 iPad versions of this game.
[290:06.58]How do I get up here?
[290:09.04]Insta-kill.
[290:11.04]There's the music.
[290:13.60]And it's gone.
[290:15.58]Nice.
[290:16.18]Now how much does this cost?
[290:17.11]5,000?
[290:17.13]5,000?
[290:19.17]Oh.
[290:19.27]This is gonna be a bad race.
[290:23.21]That's too many.
[290:24.61]Hello?
[290:26.45]What was that?
[290:28.03]It looks like a Pack-a-Punch thing, but like...
[290:31.50]What does it actually do?
[290:34.38]Oh, it's a shrieker.
[290:35.00]What?
[290:37.74]Oh.
[290:38.98]I'm getting real sick of my music just turning on for the first four beats and then turning off again.
[290:44.92]You know that myth about copyright?
[290:46.36]As long as you only play it for 10 seconds, you're fine.
[290:50.69]Oh my god.
[290:51.43]Nintendo's yet to find this dastardly creator.
[290:54.31]They won't find it.
[290:58.87]What the fuck is that noise?
[291:00.47]It's a shrieker.
[291:01.25]It's like one of those dragons.
[291:04.03]Dragons?
[291:04.47]I don't know.
[291:05.79]No, the ticking is the sound of you getting any points.
[291:08.71]Watch.
[291:10.98]I don't want any points.
[291:14.50]Oh, it is.
[291:15.98]Someone can afford to open.
[291:17.12]Someone can afford.
[291:17.70]Blue guy can do the race.
[291:19.40]Blue.
[291:19.92]I'm over here actually killing stuff.
[291:22.29]What?
[291:22.43]We were killing stuff.
[291:23.37]You took my car, Jerma.
[291:24.41]Get out.
[291:24.75]I'm sorry.
[291:24.99]I'm sorry.
[291:25.21]I'm sorry.
[291:25.53]I'm sorry.
[291:28.02]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[291:29.22]This thing's a leash!
[291:33.60]Oh, are we good?
[291:36.79]James opened it.
[291:37.39]I went backwards and I found a secret.
[291:40.23]What secret?
[291:41.67]Secret, dude.
[291:43.99]I'm gonna find this guy.
[291:44.85]It doesn't look like there's any power back here, though.
[291:47.84]You gotta open this.
[291:49.48]I'm leasing this nine-year-old BMW.
[291:53.66]Wait, I can spawn a car!
[291:55.94]What secret fun thing are you doing?
[291:59.74]What the fuck?
[292:01.00]I don't think James is anywhere near you guys.
[292:03.21]It's only $480 a month.
[292:05.25]Did you leave Criken back there?
[292:07.05]He's gonna die.
[292:08.61]Well, I thought we were all going to examine.
[292:11.61]I don't think we're gonna make it.
[292:13.37]Yes, we will.
[292:14.25]Jump over the wall.
[292:15.62]Oh, my God.
[292:16.34]Oh, we can't think of the wall.
[292:17.22]No, looks like you can't.
[292:18.36]Hang on, let me try.
[292:19.70]I'm in the car.
[292:22.75]Hey, well, that works.
[292:24.85]Your car.
[292:26.21]Don't you leave me!
[292:27.39]Do you want to stay with your car?
[292:29.75]My car's on the wall!
[292:30.89]If you just stay in the car.
[292:34.31]I'm sorry.
[292:35.57]Hey!
[292:36.03]I'm sorry.
[292:37.29]Why would you leave me?
[292:38.35]I mean...
[292:41.77]This is why we're never going to be this level, because we're all fucking abandoning each other.
[292:45.30]Jerma doomed my car.
[292:46.94]He owes me a new one.
[292:48.82]Well, you can have that one, but just... I got you guys here.
[292:50.98]There's got to be... There's a way to spawn cars, I think.
[292:55.60]Yeah, it's back here.
[292:56.24]I'll find a new one.
[292:57.62]Are you good?
[292:58.85]You sure?
[292:59.99]Yeah, you go.
[293:01.77]I'll buy a new car.
[293:03.63]I was about to just go, ah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wicked loud, and I'm so glad I didn't.
[293:10.29]Where am I going?
[293:11.46]Alright, Jerma, this is a robbery.
[293:12.46]Get out of your car.
[293:14.80]Okay.
[293:16.29]Get RP.
[293:16.89]Oh, what the fuck?
[293:18.75]Wait.
[293:19.75]Oh, no.
[293:20.55]Oh, no.
[293:21.13]Holy shit, they're still born.
[293:22.49]Dude.
[293:23.23]Dude.
[293:23.51]I'm stuck.
[293:27.17]Where do I buy a new car?
[293:28.93]We got you.
[293:31.16]You're spring-loaded.
[293:34.63]Where the fuck are you guys?
[293:35.85]I'm stuck here.
[293:37.25]You made it.
[293:37.77]Good RP.
[293:39.01]Okay.
[293:40.17]Stop, get out of the car.
[293:41.15]Okay, have it.
[293:42.73]What am I supposed to do?
[293:46.65]I think you just stuck there forever.
[293:49.31]Where are you?
[293:50.61]I'm in the middle.
[293:53.12]James, where do I find you?
[293:54.72]You're in the middle?
[293:55.42]Oh God, you are in the middle.
[293:56.84]What is this?
[293:59.51]This is what I found.
[294:00.46]It's that perk machine that gives you the fucking infinite perk.
[294:03.38]Oh, is that what it is?
[294:04.18]You can get all the perks in the game.
[294:06.48]Wow, what a map to get every perk in the game.
[294:09.24]I know, we can beat this.
[294:10.46]What a fucking map.
[294:12.82]Hang on, I gotta buy a new car.
[294:13.70]Whose car is this?
[294:15.64]Oh, dude, I got a fucking van.
[294:17.89]You are just stuck in there, huh?
[294:19.77]Yep.
[294:21.31]Alright, I wanna go in there.
[294:22.81]Wedge into my back and see if we can fling me in there or slingshot me.
[294:25.39]Do you want me to jumpstart you over that thing?
[294:26.91]Yeah, see if we can slingshot me in there.
[294:28.99]Let me get some speed.
[294:30.63]This is not a good place.
[294:32.97]Can I get into the car?
[294:35.11]I think I'm getting ripped apart by zombies inside of my car.
[294:37.43]I think they're in the car.
[294:41.46]What the fuck?
[294:41.90]Wow, that looks so much fun.
[294:44.80]I think my wheel is bugged.
[294:46.04]I can't turn.
[294:48.07]You got something in your wheel.
[294:49.71]There's something in your wheel.
[294:50.39]Do I have like a fucking like fin stuck in my wheel like a plane wing or something?
[294:55.88]Whoa, you just jumped.
[294:57.82]How'd you do that?
[294:58.62]I got some sort of, I got some sort of wheel.
[295:01.18]I got some sort of metal shard in my wheel.
[295:04.64]I paid 2,000 bucks for this thing, dude.
[295:06.88]Yeah, there is something stuck here.
[295:09.73]I don't know what you, let me see if I can help you.
[295:11.23]Get me off of this thing.
[295:14.57]I can't.
[295:15.55]How much is a car?
[295:17.60]It's like 2,500.
[295:18.90]That's it?
[295:20.11]You gotta like go up to that pipe, that blinking pipe.
[295:22.83]Yeah.
[295:25.43]Don't die.
[295:26.33]He died.
[295:32.86]I'm gonna get you in like a second.
[295:34.82]Okay.
[295:35.48]This is pretty good.
[295:36.08]Well, you guys need me to buy, dude.
[295:37.26]I don't know.
[295:38.36]I'm trying to get all these.
[295:39.36]Alright.
[295:39.70]Keep them off me.
[295:40.42]I'm gonna get you.
[295:41.72]You guys having fun out there?
[295:44.20]You're just shooting at that giant gun with one hand.
[295:48.20]I need to get up on this blue port.
[295:49.77]How the fuck?
[295:51.03]Here, I'll give you a boost.
[295:54.51]Can you?
[295:55.19]Is that possible?
[295:55.79]I don't know.
[295:56.05]I'm trying to... These zombies are like steel, man.
[295:58.25]I can't... There's something really wrong with these cars.
[296:02.24]Hey, guys.
[296:03.04]A hot take.
[296:04.18]This map is awful.
[296:06.90]Guys, I got bad news.
[296:07.66]I didn't die.
[296:08.34]Dude!
[296:10.89]Oh, wait.
[296:11.35]Hold on.
[296:11.65]I'll get you.
[296:12.05]I'll get you.
[296:12.41]I'll get you.
[296:12.79]Do you see?
[296:13.41]I don't know if you know, Jeremy.
[296:15.83]You're not using two hands for that gun.
[296:19.88]Look over here.
[296:20.42]Look over here.
[296:22.12]Yeah, that doesn't work.
[296:25.00]You're not going to hit very many.
[296:26.09]That's why you can't hit anything.
[296:28.23]Now it makes sense.
[296:29.19]Uh, you're gonna die too.
[296:30.67]Yo, it's over.
[296:31.41]Holy shit, I can't believe you just did that.
[296:33.45]Wait, come back for me!
[296:34.39]I tried to save you, you son of a bitch!
[296:36.19]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[296:37.59]I know, I know, wait.
[296:38.99]What happened?
[296:40.25]No, it was the grenade.
[296:40.98]It was just a grenade.
[296:41.82]It's okay.
[296:43.26]James!
[296:44.42]I'm dead.
[296:45.96]Why, dude?
[296:47.02]It's okay, there's no zombies.
[296:48.26]I don't know, I expected... I was cooking a grenade, and I was gonna throw it, but I held it.
[296:52.18]Whoa, whoa, I'm up here!
[296:53.78]It was funny.
[296:54.08]It was just for a joke.
[296:54.72]That was what it was.
[296:55.40]Oh, you spawned up there.
[296:56.48]I knew you did.
[296:57.18]Did you see this?
[296:58.24]There's something up there.
[296:59.74]Hit the power.
[297:00.28]At the end.
[297:01.12]Where?
[297:01.74]Yeah.
[297:02.18]I'll get it.
[297:03.04]All the way on the right side.
[297:04.55]There's something over there.
[297:05.31]I mean, I'm not compelled to come down there ever again now because I don't think zombies spawn up here.
[297:12.23]I see him.
[297:13.21]I'm going to go by the door that you guys wanted to fucking buy.
[297:16.39]Help.
[297:17.07]Help.
[297:19.47]Oh, it looks like the Pack-a-Punch is up here.
[297:21.09]Are you throwing grenades in here?
[297:23.05]Wait.
[297:23.41]Maybe if you move a car close enough, I can climb into it.
[297:28.72]Oh, that's a good idea.
[297:30.26]James, I got bad news.
[297:31.38]Turns out you just had to pay money to open up the end of the race.
[297:35.08]Yeah.
[297:35.52]And you get to the spot.
[297:36.90]There's a staircase on the other side.
[297:38.08]That was odd.
[297:38.54]Okay.
[297:39.20]Oh, that's fine.
[297:39.90]Can you get over here?
[297:40.48]Yeah.
[297:41.43]Did you do it?
[297:42.21]I killed myself.
[297:42.75]Yeah.
[297:42.91]I got a pack-a-punched shotgun because of that.
[297:45.33]What the fuck is up with this car?
[297:47.89]Ow!
[297:48.15]What the fuck is up with this car?
[297:51.31]I can hear... Can I hear you shooting from this far away?
[297:53.59]Yeah.
[297:53.95]I got a pack-a-punched shotgun, man.
[297:55.83]Of course.
[297:56.19]It's gonna make a little bit of noise.
[297:57.35]You know what I'm saying?
[297:58.45]Help me please.
[297:59.36]Here.
[297:59.98]I'll get you.
[298:00.50]Let's go around.
[298:01.16]Let's finish this race.
[298:02.04]I'm good.
[298:02.28]I'm good.
[298:03.00]Yeah?
[298:03.34]Gerber's got me.
[298:04.28]Oh yeah.
[298:04.58]You guys want to finish the race?
[298:07.00]Yeah.
[298:07.40]Let's... That's how you get over to this side.
[298:09.38]You need to finish the race.
[298:14.04]You should be able to run over zombies.
[298:16.92]Come on, what's the code here?
[298:18.94]What's the- I'm gonna die in the car.
[298:22.15]If you die in the car, that means you're, like, the worst gamer, right?
[298:26.89]Like, this- it's so easy to get away from.
[298:28.63]No, I'm talking about if you're driving, like, straight.
[298:40.59]No, I've had no disrespect.
[298:42.70]I really didn't.
[298:43.26]Wait, I want a new car.
[298:46.02]I'm going to open up the gateway.
[298:47.12]You'll be able to go straight through.
[298:49.72]This is nice.
[298:53.33]That is a nice car.
[298:54.17]You got lucky.
[298:55.63]I'll take one of these.
[298:57.05]If only I could drive it.
[299:01.99]You need to be in the car with 5,000 points.
[299:04.00]You gotta be in the car.
[299:05.72]Alright, well, I got a cool James Bond car.
[299:07.98]Maybe we should get in this one.
[299:08.64]I'm in.
[299:09.54]You get in?
[299:09.92]What the fuck?
[299:10.30]It ate my money, and it closed the gate.
[299:13.31]It closed the gate.
[299:14.57]I saw that.
[299:15.15]What?
[299:17.01]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[299:18.71]It's pushing me out of the world.
[299:20.07]I can't.
[299:20.63]Wait, there's a box over here, too.
[299:23.23]What the fuck is all this stuff?
[299:24.88]Okay.
[299:26.54]What?
[299:28.81]Stop!
[299:29.35]I'm trying to get in, too.
[299:30.09]Wait, pay the fee.
[299:30.55]Pay the fee.
[299:31.29]I don't have enough money.
[299:33.49]Do y'all not have enough money?
[299:35.21]No.
[299:35.77]Can we move this car?
[299:36.99]Wait.
[299:37.59]Why is Mario in here?
[299:39.48]Help!
[299:40.24]Help!
[299:40.74]I can't!
[299:41.32]There's a T-posing Mario.
[299:44.54]Hello?
[299:45.32]Why is he under there?
[299:46.42]Dude, I'm not feeling good anymore.
[299:48.06]I don't know what's happening.
[299:51.60]My car's gone vertical.
[299:53.11]I'm...
[299:55.78]Help!
[299:56.84]James?
[299:57.56]What's up, man?
[299:58.50]I'm walking over.
[300:01.09]Of course, in the Mario world, there's always a two-point.
[300:03.91]This is so stressful.
[300:05.57]You're straight down.
[300:06.43]James, I need you to bring a car over here and open the gate for me.
[300:11.02]You are straight down.
[300:13.82]There's some gum stuck in my axle.
[300:17.00]My back wheel's got a wing stuck in it.
[300:19.36]Where's Criken?
[300:20.91]Oh, you're dead.
[300:22.29]Oh, okay.
[300:23.81]I'm afraid if I get out, I'm going to get eaten by zombies.
[300:26.83]So I'm just going to stay in the... Oh!
[300:29.31]I'm coming.
[300:30.05]Did you just burp?
[300:34.25]What the fuck is wrong with this car?
[300:36.24]That car is fucked.
[300:38.06]You're going to have to get out and push him.
[300:43.42]You're going to have to dram me.
[300:45.18]Wait, there's fucking zombies here.
[300:47.42]Oh, I know.
[300:47.86]They want to get me, man.
[300:48.90]You gotta...
[300:51.07]Oh no.
[300:52.33]Oh no.
[300:54.17]I think you wedged in there good.
[300:57.35]I need to be in a cart as well?
[300:59.21]You gotta be in a cart.
[301:01.01]I can't get to where you are.
[301:03.27]Don't ruin my cart for me.
[301:04.59]Get in that fucking cart and open this door.
[301:07.23]Spawn a new one.
[301:08.03]They're only $2,500.
[301:10.51]I can't get out of this thing.
[301:11.59]It's absolutely not possible at this point.
[301:14.05]I'm coming.
[301:15.85]God damn it.
[301:18.25]Help.
[301:19.61]Unwedge me.
[301:21.33]Did everybody else see the Mario?
[301:22.76]I don't think so.
[301:24.16]Yeah, I saw the Mario.
[301:24.98]Is this car right here working?
[301:26.30]Oh, you saw the Mario.
[301:27.64]Yeah, that's why I was laughing.
[301:30.58]No!
[301:30.96]You're never gonna get in there.
[301:32.16]James!
[301:33.72]It didn't work, dude!
[301:35.00]If you get too close, it'll eat your money and continue to like... Oh!
[301:39.74]Oh!
[301:40.24]Oh, God!
[301:40.94]Oh, God!
[301:41.82]Are you okay?
[301:42.18]It's happening.
[301:42.91]It's happening.
[301:43.47]I'm going through the wall, I think.
[301:45.69]Oh, no.
[301:46.15]Oh, I'm free!
[301:47.27]I'm good!
[301:49.90]It's almost like they had a big plan for that Mario, and it just didn't work out.
[301:55.66]So they're just like, ah, it's too... I can't delete it.
[301:58.10]It's too big.
[301:59.13]I can't... Yeah, it's like stuck there, glitched out.
[302:00.93]I'm gonna have to put it underneath.
[302:02.43]No one will ever see it.
[302:04.05]James, you gotta get in that car.
[302:05.87]I'm gonna get in this car.
[302:07.39]Let me know when you do.
[302:08.23]Don't touch that thing until I'm there, too.
[302:09.55]I gotta slip through.
[302:11.33]I can't move this fucking car.
[302:13.45]Don't touch that thing yet.
[302:14.71]You're gonna leave me.
[302:16.60]Go!
[302:17.86]Hey, Juggernaug is here, dude.
[302:23.90]Oh, very cool.
[302:26.43]I just can't believe it didn't let you in.
[302:28.41]No, I can make the money easy, though.
[302:30.03]I got pack-a-punched guns.
[302:32.01]I just thought we could, like, you know, as a team, as friends, because everyone else is dead.
[302:35.31]I'm back here.
[302:35.67]I came back.
[302:36.45]How did you get a pack-a-punch gun?
[302:38.87]Uh, the finish line.
[302:41.51]Oh, that's right.
[302:42.71]I see you.
[302:43.15]Hey.
[302:44.29]Hey, I got the money.
[302:45.11]Oh, you got it.
[302:47.23]You got through.
[302:49.51]One came through.
[302:51.25]Can you make sure that place is cleared out for me so I can run in?
[302:54.27]It's clear.
[302:55.27]Oh, well, there's a couple that come through, but there's not a lot.
[302:58.81]There are dogs behind you.
[303:01.49]No!
[303:02.55]No!
[303:03.13]Why are they just walking?
[303:04.33]They're doing like a weird... What's this walk?
[303:07.85]They don't even want to fight you.
[303:13.49]I think you might have forgotten, but there's a race that's on right now, James.
[303:19.78]I'm right behind you.
[303:20.72]Is this the beginning of the level?
[303:22.66]Whoa.
[303:24.58]Oh, a tree?
[303:28.23]Okay, well, this level is awful.
[303:29.75]I'm going to vote in Taco Bell.
[303:32.77]The car that Criken was just in is sitting there.
[303:35.95]What do you guys think?
[303:38.81]Because I don't think with this tree here we can finish the map.
[303:42.04]I don't think it's possible.
[303:42.90]So I think I'm done.
[303:43.48]I think you're supposed to get up here.
[303:45.74]You're supposed to probably get the ramp, ramp over, ramp up here.
[303:50.54]But I mean, like, I did the lap, technically.
[303:56.22]Yeah, I guess we did.
[303:57.02]Oh, look, up here.
[303:59.64]It says, I fucking hate this map.
[304:02.70]Oh, well, that's a good enough sign for me.
[304:04.82]I think it's time to play Taco Bell.
[304:08.04]Taco Bell, McDonald's, or KFC.
[304:10.39]I can see the outside of the map right here.
[304:12.29]I can see.
[304:12.59]Hang on, give me a boost.
[304:13.77]Can you see underneath?
[304:15.23]Oh, you're pushing me under.
[304:16.25]Turn and look underneath if you can.
[304:19.67]Hold on, they're coming.
[304:24.59]I can see a better place, a better... I want to see it so bad.
[304:30.25]Give me a boost.
[304:32.65]Lift me up.
[304:38.22]I think I'm gonna let him take me.
[304:39.40]I got an idea.
[304:40.76]Kill me.
[304:42.59]James, I can't do this with you anymore.
[304:44.35]Okay.
[304:45.05]You have zombie blood.
[304:45.77]They can't see you.
[304:46.61]Wait, hold on.
[304:47.39]Can you guys just walk around the tree?
[304:50.03]It's your stealth mode.
[304:50.71]It's your stealth mode, dude.
[304:51.99]Go, go.
[304:53.15]Win the race, Tomato.
[304:54.15]Now's your chance.
[304:56.23]He's held up.
[304:58.13]Goodbye, James.
[304:59.29]I'm sorry.
[305:01.19]Wait, no.
[305:01.83]It doesn't matter as much if you don't feel bad about me winning.
[305:05.03]I'm just trying to get out of this world.
[305:09.14]Spawn a car, spawn a car, get a car, get a car, dude.
[305:11.69]Oh, I'm bankrupt.
[305:13.45]I don't have any money for a car.
[305:15.25]I don't have any money.
[305:15.97]Get that one, get that one.
[305:18.41]This is my old car.
[305:19.17]I left this car here.
[305:19.83]I glitched out up here.
[305:21.97]This is it.
[305:23.33]This is the one I kept with wings.
[305:24.89]This one can fly, you know?
[305:26.21]This is your chance.
[305:27.03]There you go.
[305:30.98]Wait.
[305:31.26]That's how I died.
[305:33.46]Be careful.
[305:33.90]Please.
[305:35.67]I can see it.
[305:37.28]That is how two people have died on this map.
[305:39.44]Not by the zombies.
[305:41.30]Second lap.
[305:43.84]Second lap.
[305:45.18]How many laps are there?
[305:46.92]There's five.
[305:48.00]No.
[305:50.19]No.
[305:51.03]No way.
[305:52.39]That was some pretty good driving around.
[305:55.17]I need another 5,000 bucks to open the door again.
[305:58.37]What do you think these parts do?
[305:59.91]There's random parts on the map, too.
[306:03.58]Man, I don't know how to explain this to you, but I don't think I care what they do.
[306:06.77]I want to leave.
[306:07.19]Get me out.
[306:08.47]You're trying to fucking win the race.
[306:10.53]No, I want to go.
[306:11.75]I want Criken to close the lobby, but he keeps on telling me to race.
[306:15.85]There must be a winner.
[306:17.90]I feel like I won.
[306:18.76]Can we go?
[306:19.68]Somebody has to win.
[306:22.58]I can't fucking- Oh, wait!
[306:24.20]Quick, look!
[306:24.74]Look!
[306:24.92]Look at Mario!
[306:25.64]Oh!
[306:28.24]Wait, I'm alive.
[306:29.00]Why am I alive?
[306:31.36]Why are we alive?
[306:32.62]We can win this.
[306:34.88]What the?
[306:35.44]Did we just trade his life for ours?
[306:37.48]We sacrificed him to the giant Mario statue?
[306:42.84]What the fuck?
[306:43.96]Now is our time.
[306:45.64]It's the time to shine.
[306:46.72]We're going backwards.
[306:47.82]We're going the wrong way.
[306:48.78]I'm going to get this cold brewski and let's go.
[306:55.74]Are we going the wrong way?
[306:57.94]I think this is the right way.
[306:58.76]Oh, there's so many.
[307:01.64]What the fuck?
[307:02.90]Yeah, no way.
[307:03.86]You're gonna get swarmed.
[307:05.58]They're all trained.
[307:06.80]I just spit all over myself.
[307:08.06]Hey, I got insta-kill for you guys.
[307:10.00]Oh, wait.
[307:11.18]Go into that corner over there.
[307:12.54]There's too many.
[307:15.59]Watch this.
[307:20.67]Investigate that corner.
[307:22.47]It's further over.
[307:25.35]I mean, I do want to see the Mario again.
[307:27.83]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[307:31.49]It's, well, I dropped through further.
[307:33.15]Oh, it's over here.
[307:33.95]It's over here, Jeremy.
[307:34.49]Wait, what?
[307:35.15]There's another Mario.
[307:35.95]Oh, is it up here?
[307:36.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[307:38.57]That's where I fell.
[307:39.11]There it is.
[307:39.57]This is the lip.
[307:40.35]This is the lip?
[307:40.92]Okay, where is Mario's location?
[307:43.34]Alright, I, ah, fuck.
[307:44.82]Is it, ah, this way?
[307:47.72]Where's the center?
[307:48.80]The center is that way, right?
[307:49.84]I'm gonna start spinning around.
[307:50.72]We'll hide you.
[307:51.22]Alright, you just start, just start spinning around until you find it.
[307:53.78]I'll tell you.
[307:56.42]East!
[307:57.64]He's East!
[307:58.34]Which East?
[307:59.40]The whole thing about East is it could be anybody's East.
[308:02.10]Why is that under there?
[308:03.42]Why is that actually under there?
[308:08.91]How do I capitalize on that and find him in Criken's honor?
[308:13.17]I don't know where East is.
[308:14.71]There he is.
[308:19.98]Um, what the fuck?
[308:22.42]Is everyone else dead?
[308:23.48]Is it just me?
[308:24.64]I don't have any money.
[308:25.61]Can we win the race?
[308:26.91]Did I win?
[308:27.65]I don't really want to grind money to do this Mario bit, honestly.
[308:32.65]I don't think the LPB is gonna work out.
[308:37.37]Where do you get that Mario model?
[308:40.66]You know what I mean?
[308:42.30]I got it from Gmod.
[308:43.58]Just from Gmod?
[308:44.22]And you made it?
[308:45.28]Yeah.
[308:47.06]I don't know.
[308:47.78]You can't, like, pull data from the Wii U disc.
[308:50.94]Oh, yeah, you can totally convert.
[308:52.72]You can pull, like, the Mario T-post from, like, Wii U. Oh, for sure.
[308:56.68]For sure.
[308:58.44]Oh, crash you.
[308:59.22]Oh, that means it was a good map.
[309:02.83]Alright, how are you guys feeling?
[309:03.63]Do you want to do one more?
[309:04.59]I don't want to hold you guys hostage if you're all burnt out from this chaos.
[309:09.07]We can do another one.
[309:09.85]I'm good.
[309:10.25]No, I'm good.
[309:10.93]I'm good.
[309:12.07]Alright, well, there's Zombie Cat Tree, which I kind of want to try.
[309:14.83]And then there's, uh... That one is... What happened to fucking Monopoly?
[309:17.51]When are we doing Monopoly?
[309:18.75]Oh, alright.
[309:19.29]We can do Monopoly.
[309:19.93]You guys talked about Monopoly for so long.
[309:21.77]We heard Monopoly.
[309:22.49]Monopoly's so much fun.
[309:23.39]We've never gotten past, like, the second wave of Monopoly, but... I mean, this might be the crew.
[309:27.97]We might have trained enough.
[309:30.35]Oh.
[309:31.05]I think we've trained enough.
[309:36.29]I can hear him swallowing tomato dude get out of my ears man I'm just I'm just waiting that's the kind of microphone that you can hear the person's mom trying to talk to them they're in like the Xbox lobby and you hear like you want this or that no yeah I'll take uh yeah I want yeah yeah I'll take a chicken alright it's not on me you hear them like smoking you can hear them smoking cigarettes
[310:04.53]You guys ever been able to hear that before?
[310:05.71]Can you ever hear somebody else in the room smoking cigarettes?
[310:09.17]Like, not the person that's in the lobby, the person, like, on their couch.
[310:13.74]On their couch?
[310:14.48]Yeah, I swear to God.
[310:15.72]Like, 20 feet away?
[310:16.58]Yeah, you just hear, like... I can hear it, I swear to God.
[310:23.38]I've never had that instance.
[310:25.59]I can hear people smoking cigarettes.
[310:31.35]Monopoly, dude.
[310:38.82]You guys haven't gotten past wave two?
[310:45.12]Wow.
[310:47.57]We didn't have enough.
[310:48.91]I think we're also... Criken, was that last time we did this we only had three people or did we have more?
[310:53.63]This was the first one we did last time.
[310:56.23]How many people did we have when we did it?
[310:58.21]I think we had three.
[310:59.21]Yeah, so we were not... Yeah, we were short a guy.
[311:00.91]We were short a guy, and we were not... We had no idea what we were doing, so... Hey, why don't we do Taco Bell first and give a two-minute timer?
[311:08.86]You want to warm up with the Taco... Alright, we'll start with Taco Bell.
[311:11.32]We'll start... With a three-minute timer.
[311:13.04]Taco Bell or KFC?
[311:13.86]Because... Alright, I'll be honest.
[311:16.00]There's McDonald's 1.0.
[311:17.91]There's Taco Bell 2.0 and KFC 3.0.
[311:19.99]All I can say about McDonald's is it's definitely the best map, but I think Taco Bell has the best...
[311:26.13]you know, presents.
[311:28.25]Taco Bell, then.
[311:29.11]Taco Bell was the one that won the vote.
[311:30.97]Okay, alright.
[311:31.52]Deal.
[311:32.06]Yeah, we don't have to do the whole thing.
[311:34.22]It's got a working drive-thru.
[311:35.18]It says so on the features.
[311:36.62]Look, every time I have Taco Bell, I'm like, this is gonna be the time that I enjoy Taco Bell.
[311:41.08]And every time I get sick, and I wish I didn't have Taco Bell.
[311:43.86]What are you ordering?
[311:44.98]Guaranteed.
[311:47.93]There's no way you can't enjoy it if it's completely digitalized, you know?
[311:51.19]What are your favorite things on the menu?
[311:52.67]Favorite things on the Taco Bell menu?
[311:54.76]I don't know because I've been sick every time I've had any of those.
[311:56.98]I wouldn't say any of them.
[312:02.50]Last time we talked about this, everyone got hungry.
[312:04.43]Which is crazy.
[312:05.49]Yeah.
[312:05.93]I mean, you don't want to make me hungry because I'll leave.
[312:08.85]I'll leave.
[312:09.55]I'm trying to join your lobby.
[312:10.89]It won't let me for some reason.
[312:13.09]Really?
[312:13.57]Uh-oh.
[312:13.97]Yeah.
[312:14.43]I'm posting again.
[312:15.17]It shouldn't be anything different.
[312:16.78]I don't even see you playing.
[312:18.22]Yeah, I keep accepting that.
[312:19.28]I keep accepting that invite, but then nothing happens.
[312:22.36]Is your game offline?
[312:23.72]Because I've had some instances where my game... Oh, shit.
[312:25.70]You're playing, yeah.
[312:27.76]Play online?
[312:28.36]Do I just quit the game and reload it?
[312:30.24]Yeah, well, yeah, just hit play online and see if it'll connect you, and then maybe it'll... That's weird.
[312:37.19]Well, I mean, okay.
[312:37.79]Just checking my files.
[312:44.11]You guys ever have a cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell?
[312:46.71]Oh, everyone has, man.
[312:48.09]I haven't, but that sounds so good.
[312:49.48]Did you say no?
[312:50.14]It's actually pretty good.
[312:51.62]Isn't that one of the... That's one of the, like, the stapled items.
[312:55.62]Yeah.
[312:56.44]Would it be... Would it be... Like, should I order that right now?
[313:02.03]Yeah.
[313:02.93]You're gonna post, made some Taco Bell right now?
[313:05.29]I mean, I'm like... Fuck.
[313:08.81]You just said yourself, though, like you fucking don't like it.
[313:11.47]I always regret it.
[313:12.65]No, don't post it.
[313:14.01]Don't break the rule.
[313:14.67]It's getting late, though, so if you're going to do it, you got to fucking do it real quick.
[313:19.38]Yeah, you can't post mates after 12 a.m.
[313:21.78]After 12 a.m., like the gremlins come out, you'll never get your water.
[313:24.98]I have totally done it later than that.
[313:27.32]Every time I've ordered Postmates after midnight, it's just like half the thing isn't there, or it's like somebody picked it up with their hands and threw it in the bag, and it's just like a mush at the bottom.
[313:35.83]Never order Postmates after midnight.
[313:37.17]It's always the worst.
[313:38.49]Oh, no.
[313:39.75]Okay.
[313:43.67]Sometimes I've had Postmates before where half the bag was napkins, and then they forgot four parts of the order.
[313:49.35]Half the bag was napkins?
[313:50.61]Oh, my God.
[313:50.85]It's just like somebody just did... It was like a joke.
[313:52.74]Somebody was making a joke.
[313:54.46]Okay, okay, okay.
[313:54.98]I'm looking.
[313:55.32]I'm looking.
[313:55.82]I can order it.
[313:56.62]Uh...
[313:58.17]Gordito?
[313:59.17]Is that one?
[314:01.11]Okay.
[314:01.31]Three?
[314:03.47]Three of them is a lot.
[314:04.67]Three of the combos?
[314:05.83]What, are you kidding me?
[314:06.79]No, not the full combo, just the thing.
[314:08.03]Why would you get the fucking combos?
[314:09.44]Half that's garbage in there.
[314:11.32]Okay.
[314:12.02]Just get the actual... This is Taco Bell-ing?
[314:14.60]You're eating, like, the fucking side of garbage.
[314:17.90]No, I'm getting mad now.
[314:19.08]I think it's time to get a little more.
[314:20.20]I'm putting away my phone.
[314:21.80]Alright, wait, hold on.
[314:22.76]I need to look at the menu here because I can't find it on my phone.
[314:24.88]What the fuck is happening in here?
[314:27.05]One time I threw a moppy.
[314:28.01]Keep the moppy so you can read the menu.
[314:30.89]Now take a look.
[314:31.47]It's got to be on here.
[314:33.93]If the Cheesy Goat Eaters Crunch is not on here, delete this map.
[314:36.15]Oh, it's up there.
[314:36.55]I actually see it.
[314:37.17]It's my specialties.
[314:38.09]It's the second one in on specialties.
[314:39.57]Okay, I'm trying to look.
[314:42.17]What's in it?
[314:44.55]It's 289.
[314:45.01]289.
[314:45.03]289.
[314:45.05]Makes sense.
[314:46.15]Let him decipher what it is.
[314:47.19]Can you figure out what it is?
[314:48.82]Beef beef.
[314:49.42]I'm looking at beef looking at some it looks like green and cheese.
[314:55.00]Look a little closer.
[314:57.12]What makes that different?
[314:58.04]What makes that cheese a gordita crunch the thing that it is?
[314:59.68]What is it?
[315:00.00]What's the difference?
[315:00.56]There's two.
[315:00.94]There's two.
[315:01.38]There's two.
[315:02.04]There's two taco.
[315:03.71]Yeah.
[315:04.15]Go on.
[315:05.75]And cheese on both.
[315:07.69]Hold on.
[315:07.99]We got... We're all dead.
[315:11.19]We're all fucking dead.
[315:14.15]My order.
[315:15.29]My order.
[315:16.49]The service here sucks.
[315:18.43]Oh, I got insta-kill, wow.
[315:19.85]We're good, we're good.
[315:25.29]Get up.
[315:29.69]Hard and soft shell within one another?
[315:31.81]That's crazy.
[315:32.77]That's crazy talk.
[315:33.51]It's crazy.
[315:34.19]You're right, it is crazy.
[315:35.41]And this cheese spread on the soft shell.
[315:37.35]Oh, I'm dead again.
[315:38.03]Are we all sponsored by Taco Bell?
[315:42.21]I forgot we were playing a video game.
[315:43.51]I definitely take money from them to bring up this sort of shit on stream.
[315:49.02]Every time.
[315:51.24]That's why you think I picked this map and added it to my collection.
[315:54.78]Delicious.
[315:56.46]Cheesy gordita taste.
[315:59.26]The fire sauce.
[316:00.66]There's like a burning asshole joke in here if you guys want to see some moments that's in there.
[316:06.18]I'm not allowed to talk about that because they asked me not to.
[316:09.72]I love to talk about burning assholes.
[316:11.40]Let's take a look.
[316:12.06]Take a look at me.
[316:13.74]Oh, that's pretty funny.
[316:15.28]That's all, you know, relatable.
[316:20.93]If I was the map maker, I'd put red all over this.
[316:23.77]That's gonna be you in a fucking couple hours here.
[316:28.18]Oh, man.
[316:29.12]What if I'm asleep by then?
[316:30.04]No, you'll feel it tomorrow.
[316:33.06]No, that's not good.
[316:33.80]You don't want to sleep with diarrhea in your body.
[316:37.37]Because then you know it's in there and you know you gotta get it out sloshing around.
[316:41.91]No, that's not good.
[316:42.61]You wanna go outside?
[316:43.91]Should I get us out of here?
[316:45.03]Yeah, whatever gets us out of this whole conversation sounds pretty good.
[316:48.23]Get me out.
[316:49.45]Yeah, get me out.
[316:51.32]Now Taco Bell gives you diarrhea, doesn't it?
[316:56.24]No, it doesn't.
[316:56.98]It doesn't.
[316:58.40]He's doing the speed voice, guys.
[316:59.78]Everyone listen.
[317:00.42]It doesn't do that.
[317:01.44]It's like a joke.
[317:02.20]It's like a meme.
[317:05.15]Oh my god.
[317:07.79]Well, I opened the door, you guys.
[317:10.25]You can go outside at the Taco Bell if you'd like.
[317:13.53]Why would I want to leave?
[317:15.98]Hey, I got the thunder gun.
[317:18.60]Oh, that thing's good.
[317:23.42]Clear him off of me.
[317:24.44]Clear him off of me.
[317:25.24]Get him off of me.
[317:25.98]Hey, I don't know if that was a... What good are you, bro?
[317:30.08]Come on.
[317:32.41]Hey, did you know that if you eat Taco Bell, like, dude, you get, like, fucking cramps?
[317:38.05]Like, that doesn't happen, like... I mean, like, I... I don't remember many times after I had Taco Bell that I, like, was incapacitated for, like... And did you know that it's, like, 75% fake meat and there's human meat in it, too?
[317:54.09]They have their menu back here.
[317:56.11]This is hostile.
[317:57.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[317:57.91]Hold them up.
[317:59.00]Hold them up.
[318:01.48]No!
[318:04.56]You can read the menu closer.
[318:07.93]I don't think they had the Gordita Crunch.
[318:09.91]You guys see this, like, hostile advertising on the back of...
[318:14.63]Is there?
[318:14.97]Wait, why is this burrito crisp?
[318:17.09]I need a massive McDonald's.
[318:19.13]It says McDonald's is coming soon.
[318:22.27]Coming soon.
[318:23.21]I mean, that map exists.
[318:24.11]They got empanadas?
[318:25.33]They have empanadas at Taco Bell?
[318:27.49]Huh?
[318:28.21]Are you fucking serious?
[318:30.05]I'll postmase it right now, too.
[318:31.41]Hi, well, we're over our three minutes on this map, guys, so it's time to wrap up.
[318:34.78]I'm gonna order these empanadas.
[318:36.24]I gotta order food.
[318:37.16]Hold on.
[318:37.80]Let me order the food.
[318:38.80]Wait, are we all gonna order Taco Bell?
[318:41.82]Oh, not in real life.
[318:42.62]Alright, I'm actually gonna do it right now.
[318:46.37]Oh, shit!
[318:49.45]I think it... Did it give me this?
[318:50.85]Is this what it gave me?
[318:51.81]Hey, you guys wanna see a funny meme?
[318:53.11]Let me know.
[318:54.03]Well, you better order before the gremlins come out.
[318:55.87]Alright, well, here's a funny meme.
[318:58.73]If you look at top left, it says 30 customers left.
[319:03.23]God damn it, dude.
[319:03.99]Oh, I'm physically looking.
[319:07.05]Looking in the top.
[319:07.63]Instead of zombies, they're implying that the zombies are a customer.
[319:11.26]I get it.
[319:12.04]No.
[319:14.32]Hold on a minute.
[319:14.81]This stuff isn't even real.
[319:18.11]Wait, what?
[319:20.79]I've been to Taco Bell a lot of times.
[319:22.85]Mexi fries?
[319:23.91]No, those aren't real.
[319:25.01]I had someone talking about those earlier today in my chat.
[319:27.63]I saw it.
[319:28.84]Someone brought up Mexi-Fries.
[319:29.98]They took them off of the menu.
[319:31.20]I don't know why, but they actually removed, they executed them recently from the menu.
[319:35.58]They don't exist anymore.
[319:36.78]I knew they had these bowls.
[319:37.59]They must exist, because someone talked about them, and there's no way.
[319:41.91]They sell cigars?
[319:44.15]Look at... No.
[319:45.87]He sells... Crisp beef burrito.
[319:48.97]Look at that.
[319:49.63]That's a nice cigar.
[319:52.51]Look at the bottom.
[319:53.23]Yeah, I see it.
[319:55.47]Oh!
[319:58.85]I mean, I think it's legit.
[320:00.09]I think those do exist.
[320:01.06]I'm trying to read the menu!
[320:02.70]Quit beeping behind me!
[320:06.00]We're all here at fucking 2 o'clock in the morning.
[320:08.22]You don't have to hold the horn down.
[320:11.50]Fifty people behind me trying to punch me.
[320:14.90]Oh, there's a way down underground!
[320:16.26]Did you guys ever understand that when people do that shit?
[320:19.46]Keep them off of me!
[320:23.84]Oh, I definitely don't have time to get you.
[320:26.84]It's like a thousand guys.
[320:29.78]Oh, now I do.
[320:31.02]Should I get a cool ranch burrito?
[320:35.30]Stop squirming.
[320:36.64]I'm not moving.
[320:37.84]I haven't even moved at all.
[320:39.52]Is doing this a little legal?
[320:42.18]What the fuck happened?
[320:44.68]Oh, you're dead.
[320:46.24]Yeah, I'm dead.
[320:47.62]Bye.
[320:48.22]Taco time.
[320:49.00]Is taco time Taco Bell?
[320:53.36]Is that a different company?
[320:54.76]Wait, is this a... Wait a minute.
[320:55.98]This is not even Taco Bell.
[320:57.16]Could this guy not get the actual Taco Bell menu?
[320:59.58]You want to get fucking sued?
[321:01.10]Yeah, guys.
[321:02.28]Taco Time is a different restaurant.
[321:04.56]Like, he grabbed an adjacent taco-themed restaurant and put it up on his Taco Bell menu?
[321:09.71]Like, map?
[321:12.19]What?
[321:14.63]We're shilling for the wrong restaurant.
[321:17.39]I'm not going to let you die, buddy.
[321:20.19]Did you kill them all?
[321:21.33]Yeah, I got them.
[321:21.75]Oh, there's one customer left.
[321:24.69]Don't kill him.
[321:25.55]I'm going underground.
[321:26.29]I need to explore this map.
[321:28.03]What's the fiery sauce?
[321:29.11]What is that called?
[321:30.43]Fire sauce.
[321:31.59]It's not on here.
[321:32.81]It just says fire sauce.
[321:33.97]Is it red sauce?
[321:34.63]It's technically fire.
[321:36.33]How many McChickens do you think you guys could eat in one sitting?
[321:38.57]If you were really hungry.
[321:39.27]I'm going to say six.
[321:39.99]30.
[321:40.17]Wait, 30.
[321:42.15]Oh, I thought you meant nuggets.
[321:43.89]McChickens?
[321:45.47]I always like to get nuggets.
[321:46.33]McChickens.
[321:47.95]I could probably do four or five.
[321:51.57]I eat a lot. 30.
[321:54.30]I eat a lot.
[321:55.52]You'd be winning competitions.
[321:58.56]Ask Criken.
[321:59.10]I eat a lot.
[322:00.04]He does eat a lot.
[322:01.32]I eat an abnormal amount.
[322:07.67]Wait, he eats a lot.
[322:08.09]Is he a watermelon over there?
[322:09.95]No, wait, watermelon.
[322:12.17]Yeah, the beginning said shoot three watermelons.
[322:14.72]There's gonna be some joke here where you follow that pipe all the way to the end.
[322:19.34]And that's gonna pump into the restaurant as like the meat or something.
[322:23.10]Yay!
[322:26.02]What does that mean?
[322:27.37]I think I'm gonna jump in this purple hole.
[322:31.63]I'm strapped down here.
[322:37.35]Don't go down there.
[322:38.73]Go a different way.
[322:40.15]What is this music, dude?
[322:41.11]This is a real band, I think.
[322:42.29]Is this like Sum 41?
[322:43.09]I don't want to go to school.
[322:45.76]I just want to stay at home.
[322:47.52]Oh, I opened the door.
[322:50.38]Smart.
[322:52.06]Careful.
[322:52.48]The last purple room I went in killed me instantly.
[323:00.21]Man, we waited just long enough to talk there that we definitely murdered all of our VODs.
[323:04.29]That's pretty cool.
[323:08.03]That was a good unified silence.
[323:11.25]How the fuck do I open this?
[323:15.31]The watermelon, I need the other watermelon to open this.
[323:19.98]I love this Taco Bell map playthrough.
[323:23.16]I wish this played in Taco Bell.
[323:26.86]No worries guys, I'll find this.
[323:29.77]It's probably up there.
[323:35.24]Man's ready to come back to Taco Bell.
[323:36.96]This is Sum 41, by the way.
[323:41.74]Yeah, I have all their albums.
[323:43.18]I just know I know so I do this thing where you know how like you play you get in the car and you pick up a few people and you get you know, you want them to hear your music that you think is good and Then you but you're you know that they're not gonna like this But like maybe if you put on the best one of the album, they'll listen and go.
[324:01.10]Oh, actually, this is pretty fucking cool And you're like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[324:03.64]I'll put on some some 41 I do that to everybody and I put this song on
[324:09.93]And I like, I just sit there and I hope that they're going to be like, this is pretty good.
[324:12.25]And I like validate myself going like, yeah, it is fucking kind of good.
[324:15.26]You know, that it fell off recently.
[324:19.00]Literally, now I have like a poster of all of them separately, not just the band as a whole.
[324:23.18]Each individual band member is on the wall.
[324:30.68]Why are we doing this?
[324:31.46]Why are we here?
[324:32.10]I think this is symbolic of the song.
[324:35.64]I want to be relieved.
[324:36.24]I think he's doing a bit with the song lyrics.
[324:38.68]Crawling.
[324:39.30]To make you go on and on.
[324:41.30]And on.
[324:43.16]Can we?
[324:44.26]I mean.
[324:46.20]Look at this little car.
[324:50.06]Can we all acknowledge how small this car is?
[324:52.62]Funny Streg.
[324:54.62]I can't hear anyone, actually, by the way.
[324:55.92]Oh, it's over.
[324:56.46]Alright.
[324:57.84]It is Taco Bell.
[324:58.22]I'm going to go back down and turn it back on.
[324:59.98]I'll be right back.
[325:01.38]Oh, my God.
[325:02.11]Yeah, no, the answer to that was, yeah, I'm going down.
[325:06.35]Why did they start us with these awful shield claws?
[325:09.11]What are these?
[325:11.61]They're like some really bad fucking crossbows or something.
[325:14.84]I thought we were leaving.
[325:16.46]I thought after some funny ones I was leaving.
[325:21.50]We need enough to get through the other door.
[325:23.40]I thought we were going to leave.
[325:27.96]Oh, I found a shield spark.
[325:30.44]That'll be the end of my story.
[325:31.74]Oh no!
[325:34.99]What do you think this- so you never found the last watermelon, James?
[325:38.20]No, there's one more left.
[325:40.52]To- to get- to beat the map rush.
[325:41.94]50 bucks is the- James, touch down!
[325:43.98]Oh, fuck, fuck, mummy!
[325:45.10]Oh, I did it, Dawn!
[325:46.34]I did it, Dawn!
[325:47.96]Fuck off.
[325:48.32]Thanks for reminding me.
[325:49.18]I'm gonna go turn that back on.
[325:50.87]No.
[325:51.57]No.
[325:51.93]Yes.
[325:52.95]Here I go.
[325:53.37]Oh, fuck.
[325:59.35]Alright, there's three left.
[326:01.49]Two left.
[326:03.58]Okay, they're after me.
[326:04.88]We're okay.
[326:06.08]Silence.
[326:07.02]Why do you get an accent when you sing, like, punk songs?
[326:09.30]You know what I mean?
[326:09.76]I know.
[326:10.64]Like, you can honestly sing any lyrics and make it sound like a punk song if you just drag out every fucking consonant.
[326:15.95]Every E, every A, and every O. Yeah.
[326:18.11]Yeah, all the vowels.
[326:23.09]Silence!
[326:24.50]Midnight!
[326:25.84]Zombies crawling in the dark!
[326:29.68]Well, it would be crawling.
[326:32.84]Crawling in the dark.
[326:35.70]Crawling.
[326:36.92]Crawling in the dark.
[326:39.48]Close, close.
[326:40.10]I made a zombie shield.
[326:41.26]By the way, you're not going to join the fucking band.
[326:45.06]That's an original song, James.
[326:46.19]Don't worry.
[326:49.29]Croiling.
[326:51.73]It's croiling.
[326:53.27]Croiling.
[326:55.13]Croiling in the...
[326:58.21]That's, that's like so exaggerated.
[327:01.98]Go croiling!
[327:07.08]You sound like my grandma though.
[327:10.57]Oh, they were just croiling!
[327:13.13]They can't hit me behind the glass!
[327:18.20]Oh, dude.
[327:19.16]Glass.
[327:19.90]Alright, can we get the fuck out of here?
[327:24.63]I want to leave.
[327:26.27]Why are we still doing this here?
[327:27.83]I'm with him.
[327:28.43]Let's go.
[327:28.89]You got to join yourself.
[327:30.69]I found it.
[327:31.43]Wait, hold on.
[327:32.17]No, that's just a bag.
[327:33.29]We need the last one.
[327:34.78]No, we don't.
[327:36.66]We haven't beat one.
[327:38.24]I'm dying.
[327:39.42]This is killing me, James.
[327:40.84]I'm dying.
[327:41.66]Wait.
[327:42.16]There's only 23.
[327:43.10]Actually, it's killing me.
[327:44.48]It's killing me.
[327:46.12]I got to go.
[327:47.79]There really are only like 18 left.
[327:50.77]Oh, but we gotta get out of here.
[327:53.31]Oh my goodness.
[327:54.13]There's one left.
[327:55.01]I trimmed the pack.
[327:56.49]Nobody's reviving me.
[327:58.79]Sitting in the pavement of the driveway where the cars are.
[328:06.18]You sound like Morton Goldman from Family Guy.
[328:14.58]Oh, James, I found it.
[328:15.62]I got it.
[328:17.42]They gave us a free perk.
[328:18.80]Well, I'm leaving.
[328:20.59]Yeah!
[328:22.39]I found another pack.
[328:23.81]That's about the end of it for me, folks.
[328:27.47]Wait, I can order food for $2,000.
[328:29.21]Do it.
[328:29.51]It gave me a times two multiplier.
[328:31.03]That's it.
[328:37.34]Hey, guys.
[328:38.28]You can get something nifty up here.
[328:39.78]Right here.
[328:40.70]Want to play Monopoly?
[328:42.28]Something nifty.
[328:43.44]Right here.
[328:47.38]Blink for 20.
[328:55.53]Get that double.
[328:57.13]Points now.
[328:58.07]Tomato is in the driveway.
[329:03.16]Sounds like you're doing you're doing a joke like hold your nose and scream strain like I'm not holding my nose though Oh shit I can't wait to be over I can't wait to be over just now
[329:30.01]How the fuck do we beat this level?
[329:34.36]Does that door open?
[329:38.60]Whoa, you just figured it out.
[329:40.02]It's bleach.
[329:40.48]What is it?
[329:41.10]What is it?
[329:41.82]Tell us.
[329:42.16]Quick, get it.
[329:48.02]I'm here.
[329:48.36]Oh, don't bother.
[329:50.12]You don't need to.
[329:52.42]Sodium phosphate.
[329:56.09]Garlic.
[329:58.37]63,000 to secure this.
[330:01.21]Oh my god.
[330:02.37]Wait, can they not come in here?
[330:06.08]63,000.
[330:06.14]I don't want to wait here for two hours.
[330:09.28]I definitely want to enable this level and the silly joke at the end by paying 63,000.
[330:13.94]I just ordered food from this place and I'm going to be fucking bleached.
[330:19.02]I'm dying.
[330:19.94]I'd kill myself.
[330:21.28]Wait, I'm not dead?
[330:22.08]Wow!
[330:24.25]Looks like it was a delayed fuse.
[330:28.95]How do I get down there to you guys?
[330:32.19]Go down into the sewer through the road, the little garage.
[330:36.49]The little garage?
[330:38.21]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[330:39.51]Yeah, I see it.
[330:40.57]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[330:42.46]Go down to the garage and then turn left.
[330:44.56]Come down here into the sewer.
[330:46.46]Alright, nice.
[330:47.34]Follow me.
[330:48.64]Watch out, watch out.
[330:52.45]Okay, that just disorientated me.
[330:55.43]I don't know what happened.
[330:56.85]Alright, here we go.
[331:00.29]Now I'm here for the silly bit.
[331:03.33]Funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, can't wait!
[331:06.27]Come on in and see it, it's really funny.
[331:08.89]Wanna look at it one more time?
[331:15.11]Yeah, okay.
[331:18.23]Did you see the other funny thing that was there too?
[331:20.23]What is it?
[331:20.73]Right there.
[331:21.84]Look on the ingredients.
[331:22.98]Second one down.
[331:24.18]Second to the last one.
[331:26.04]Cocaine.
[331:27.18]Hey, I got bad news.
[331:28.06]There's zombies in here.
[331:30.68]Oh, it's spelled like a funny word.
[331:40.24]I'm gonna just keep doing this till we end the level.
[331:41.76]I'm the one that ends this level.
[331:43.46]Yeah, what the fuck are you saying?
[331:45.00]I'm about to hit the escape button.
[331:49.29]Please, I'm really close to the 60,000.
[331:51.93]I'm gonna do it.
[331:57.09]How did I only have 6,100 points?
[331:59.29]Did I do anything?
[332:01.14]I had zero headshots.
[332:02.88]You guys just kept fucking dying and talking about Taco.
[332:07.59]You guys may as well have just thrown my dead body down the hallway and I would have killed more people.
[332:19.41]What do we have left?
[332:20.75]Well, we actually have a lot left, technically, if we want to be honest.
[332:24.48]There's like 150 gigs worth of stuff.
[332:28.26]But there's a lot left, Criken.
[332:30.08]I don't think we've actually done 50% of the entire pack I put together from both streams.
[332:36.04]Damn.
[332:37.44]Hey!
[332:38.79]I was using the crossbows the whole time.
[332:40.53]Monopoly.
[332:42.63]Monopoly.
[332:46.49]Monopoly has always seemed pretty good, you know.
[332:48.80]You guys are going to love it.
[332:50.06]You guys tough this one up.
[332:51.64]There's a lot of visual inspiration on the Monopoly here.
[332:56.04]Guess who it's made by?
[332:58.10]Is it?
[332:58.42]No.
[332:59.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[333:01.94]Is it my boy?
[333:03.30]You gotta guess who it is.
[333:05.44]Uh-oh, waiting connection.
[333:06.74]I can't wait till we get halfway through this and somebody flips the table.
[333:11.64]Like every monopoly game, you know?
[333:14.52]It's Killjoy.
[333:15.36]No!
[333:15.94]Killjoy!
[333:17.54]No!
[333:18.40]Who the hell else did you expect to make a board game level?
[333:21.19]What is this noise?
[333:22.83]It's money.
[333:23.69]Welcome.
[333:24.45]Well...
[333:26.76]You guys wanted it.
[333:27.64]You guys kept asking.
[333:30.48]Why is there like a California smog over this?
[333:33.80]There's like a haze.
[333:34.60]There's like a smog.
[333:36.09]Been stuck here for countless hours.
[333:37.79]What is he saying?
[333:38.63]The Shadow Man?
[333:39.83]We have to free the Shadow Man from this game so he can live in peace.
[333:43.83]Don't get too distracted by the lore or else the zombies will get you.
[333:47.47]This haze is kind of making me hurt.
[333:56.51]Well, that's the haze of economic uncertainty.
[333:58.23]Oh, God, I fell off.
[333:59.69]Don't fall off of the board.
[334:02.26]Okay, so how do we play?
[334:02.94]How do you even get to the next area?
[334:05.98]Whoever's blue, just press F on these dice.
[334:09.31]Yeah, blue.
[334:09.71]Me?
[334:12.48]I lied about the intricacies of it.
[334:13.96]It really just moves like two at a time.
[334:15.22]It doesn't even fucking roll.
[334:16.10]What did you land on?
[334:16.62]Welcome to my third trap, my final trap of the evening.
[334:20.54]It's really just Candyland again, but in Monopoly form.
[334:23.60]I am the champion.
[334:25.06]There's not enough room for us to be here.
[334:27.42]I'm out of ammo.
[334:28.66]Well, this is why we only made it two rounds.
[334:31.92]Welcome to my trap dungeon.
[334:33.70]Do you at least get to pick like, do we get, why don't we just play Monopoly like actually?
[334:40.95]No.
[334:43.28]Why don't we?
[334:43.90]What are you guys doing tomorrow?
[334:45.05]I'm just kidding.
[334:45.83]Oh, God.
[334:46.03]Oh, man.
[334:46.25]We need more money.
[334:46.91]Someone has enough to get us through.
[334:52.61]I'm going to get it.
[334:53.47]I think I rolled it.
[334:54.45]I just fell off.
[335:09.61]Nice axe.
[335:10.41]What was that?
[335:11.67]How'd you do that?
[335:12.53]Wait, how'd you throw that thing?
[335:13.51]We got a chance.
[335:14.59]E?
[335:15.75]I took a chance.
[335:16.37]You can hold E. Oh, I got a reward.
[335:18.62]Nice.
[335:19.98]Push dice.
[335:21.12]We're in jail.
[335:21.68]Keep pushing.
[335:23.34]No, we're just visiting.
[335:24.50]We're just visiting.
[335:25.14]Alright.
[335:25.74]You know, actually, this is the farthest we've ever gone.
[335:27.14]I'm going to keep going.
[335:30.44]I wish I had any ammo.
[335:32.21]Yeah.
[335:32.49]Find us.
[335:35.03]Oh god, I fell off.
[335:36.31]Oh guys, if you're like screwed you can warp all the way back to the beginning.
[335:39.49]Max ammo, that's what I'm talking about.
[335:41.05]Nice work.
[335:42.79]Fuck yeah, who did that?
[335:44.65]What?
[335:44.95]We might win.
[335:45.71]That was fucking awesome.
[335:46.51]You're the man.
[335:47.01]Who the fuck picked up that max ammo dude, I'm serious.
[335:50.21]I did.
[335:50.72]That was a lot.
[335:51.40]Alright.
[335:52.96]Where the fuck can I get this gun?
[335:55.44]He's got an A-50.
[335:58.16]God damn it, I didn't have enough.
[336:03.78]Yo, so if you're in danger, jump off the board because it'll send you back to the start.
[336:07.28]I need to buy a gun.
[336:09.53]Buy this.
[336:10.51]If you have the money for it, buy this one.
[336:14.03]Almost.
[336:17.83]It shoots bullets, which is pretty much the only quota I have.
[336:23.43]No!
[336:24.93]Oh, my God.
[336:25.59]James, keep them off of me.
[336:27.87]I'm jumping.
[336:28.35]I thought that guy just called me a turd.
[336:39.93]Who's the guy with the hat?
[336:41.82]Has 3,000.
[336:42.06]Someone has 3,000 points.
[336:46.80]I do.
[336:47.76]I've been trapped over here.
[336:49.76]Get that M. Give it to me.
[336:51.34]Give it to me.
[336:58.08]Uh-oh.
[336:59.60]What?
[337:00.46]I spent it all.
[337:01.16]Uh-oh.
[337:02.18]What the fuck did you just spend it on?
[337:03.72]You spent it all.
[337:05.10]I have a question for anybody that can answer.
[337:07.30]Why does Monopoly matter here?
[337:11.63]What does it matter?
[337:13.45]Stop with that thinking of yours.
[337:15.35]It's Candyland.
[337:16.53]It's just a Monopoly board?
[337:18.23]Just go ahead and help me kill these leopard cats.
[337:20.65]What are these fiery Pikachus?
[337:22.69]These Pikachu things.
[337:24.19]It's fucking music again.
[337:28.85]I'm pushing forward a bit.
[337:30.54]We're almost to the box.
[337:32.12]Oh, we're almost to a community chest!
[337:34.68]He's built a really interesting brand with his mouse.
[337:38.38]Alright, who's gonna open this one?
[337:45.03]Charge zombies rent.
[337:47.31]Yeah, put a hotel on there, and then they land on it.
[337:51.92]I need a better gun than this.
[337:54.11]I think we got a kill zone.
[337:55.21]Somebody just said that and it was funny.
[337:59.31]I believed you.
[338:00.57]Three parties?
[338:01.33]Ow!
[338:02.29]Why the fuck?
[338:05.14]I'm down.
[338:06.96]Help me.
[338:09.62]I have no gun.
[338:11.06]Good gun.
[338:12.60]Axe ammo.
[338:16.40]I just bought the last fine.
[338:18.58]Here it is.
[338:23.22]What is up there?
[338:23.96]Oh my god, it's 950.
[338:25.18]Hold F to take a chance.
[338:26.80]Oh!
[338:27.24]Oh, fuck!
[338:27.97]It wasn't a good chance.
[338:29.15]I got you.
[338:30.61]The odds... Hang on, I'm gonna try... Oh!
[338:32.45]Don't touch this thing!
[338:33.43]Are you spending money?
[338:35.07]No, it's free, but I'm just making sure that it's safe for everyone else.
[338:38.14]It's not... Don't touch this thing.
[338:40.60]I think it uses 10 bucks a pop, actually.
[338:44.80]That's third time.
[338:47.10]Three times the charm.
[338:47.94]I don't know if my odds are bad or what.
[338:50.74]I'm not going to try it again.
[338:51.54]You try it.
[338:52.10]I'll get you one.
[338:53.59]I think this is a kill on touch situation.
[338:56.25]Why do you guys keep doing that?
[338:57.91]Because it seems like it takes some money when you use it, which means it might give you something good.
[339:02.69]Hang on.
[339:02.89]We got instant kill.
[339:03.59]I'm trying it one more time.
[339:05.87]It's possible that you could do this and then hit the mega bonus.
[339:09.04]It's possible it gives you something really good.
[339:10.82]You want to give it a go?
[339:12.46]What's this thing?
[339:14.44]Why is this thing red?
[339:15.42]I think he's the last one.
[339:17.89]Yeah.
[339:18.01]Alright.
[339:18.47]Wait.
[339:19.11]Wait for the next wave to start.
[339:21.15]I think the chance is... It's a chance to desync you from the game.
[339:23.97]I'm warping out.
[339:26.03]I don't feel good.
[339:27.17]Stop chancing it, dude.
[339:29.07]I'm like... I'm getting this... Like this pop-up on my screen that shows something yanking out the ethernet cable of my computer and I don't know what's happening to me.
[339:36.92]What?
[339:38.18]I think my internet is breaking down.
[339:40.34]Zombie shield, dude.
[339:42.03]I pushed it so far.
[339:43.42]Lots of zombies.
[339:46.38]Where did we even... Where did they come from?
[339:51.44]I think I'm dead.
[339:52.38]Don't even bother getting me up.
[339:54.12]I've entered Twilight Zone and I'm not moving anymore.
[339:57.92]Oh, they're moving the dice.
[339:58.88]Uh-oh.
[339:59.72]I think... What if I... I moved the dice a little bit.
[340:01.65]Uh-oh.
[340:02.41]I might... I'm DC'd.
[340:03.29]I'm not even there.
[340:06.51]Oh, no!
[340:07.05]Move it again!
[340:08.43]Dude!
[340:09.91]I gotta pass!
[340:10.63]Go!
[340:10.90]Keep moving it!
[340:11.34]Keep moving it!
[340:12.16]Whoa!
[340:12.52]Move!
[340:12.66]You have more money than me!
[340:13.92]I'm sorry!
[340:14.32]I failed, James!
[340:15.14]I'm sorry!
[340:15.56]Jump off!
[340:15.98]Jump off!
[340:16.32]Jump off, dude!
[340:18.06]Jump off!
[340:18.52]I jumped off!
[340:19.26]Wait, what if I jump off?
[340:21.46]Jump off.
[340:22.58]Can I jump off and respawn for you?
[340:25.11]Go!
[340:25.33]Are you here?
[340:25.85]We'll get you!
[340:26.23]We'll get you!
[340:27.21]No, I can't.
[340:27.71]I can't go off.
[340:28.85]Oh, that's it then.
[340:29.77]It's alright.
[340:30.55]I'll come back for you.
[340:37.54]Oh, man, too many.
[340:39.26]I respawned.
[340:40.02]You respawned?
[340:40.76]Okay.
[340:41.56]Tomato's gone.
[340:42.42]Tomato!
[340:43.14]I took the chance, and the chance was a chance to crash my game.
[340:47.84]And that's what it did.
[340:49.30]So I'm rejoining now.
[340:50.60]No one's fault but you.
[340:51.36]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[340:52.42]What?
[340:52.72]Fuck you!
[340:53.54]No, it's your fault for not stopping me!
[340:55.18]You know I'm prone to gambling.
[340:57.04]It's in my personality.
[340:57.92]And you watch.
[340:58.72]You fucking watch.
[340:59.92]Yeah.
[341:01.72]How much is it?
[341:02.14]Just push?
[341:03.30]850 still?
[341:04.04]Oh, God.
[341:04.64]15 now.
[341:09.18]Max ammo.
[341:09.99]Oh my god, I fell off.
[341:10.91]Time is two, time is two, time is two.
[341:12.87]Guys, time is two though.
[341:13.59]Am I going the wrong way?
[341:16.13]Hello?
[341:16.45]What?
[341:16.67]Who's talking?
[341:18.87]He just left.
[341:38.83]He's getting food.
[341:41.27]You guys, welcome to the stream.
[341:46.61]Wait, I'm on the other side of the dice.
[341:48.51]Guys, I gotta get the food.
[341:49.69]The lobby's not joinable.
[341:52.45]Well, guys, I hope you guys... No, we're so close to like... I got a perk.
[341:58.31]We have to complete it.
[341:58.96]We have to complete it.
[342:01.06]Oh, did you pass go?
[342:01.84]Yeah, I got a perk.
[342:03.00]Oh my god.
[342:04.43]Then what does that mean?
[342:04.99]What do we... What happens now?
[342:05.99]That means... Roll it again.
[342:07.95]You keep going.
[342:08.35]Good game.
[342:09.37]So you get all these perks.
[342:12.17]As stupid as that sounds.
[342:14.92]It's... Okay.
[342:16.94]That sounds very stupid.
[342:19.46]I don't know how that dog killed him.
[342:20.80]Did he explode on me?
[342:22.98]I did it.
[342:23.60]I got to go.
[342:29.08]Do we get anything for go?
[342:30.86]I don't think so.
[342:33.99]Is there like a button near there that you can do?
[342:35.99]We did it.
[342:36.36]We finished it.
[342:36.78]I think this is just park.
[342:37.80]Okay, it's 25,000 to escape.
[342:40.43]Well, that's not a lot.
[342:41.76]We can do this.
[342:43.32]Just right back here.
[342:44.14]We can do this.
[342:45.58]I'm inviting you.
[342:47.30]I don't think I can join even if you invite me.
[342:50.08]I literally have to get my food.
[342:51.54]They're going to drive away with it.
[342:53.84]Boy, they're outside?
[342:56.12]I ordered it.
[342:56.81]It's there outside.
[342:57.67]Oh, my God.
[342:58.53]What is this?
[342:58.91]You just got cheesy gordita crunches.
[343:00.59]Yeah, they're waiting for me, dude, right outside.
[343:02.39]Yeah, I can't get in.
[343:03.01]This is a two-man job.
[343:05.23]Oh, hell.
[343:05.81]Alright.
[343:06.91]Try to defend me, guys.
[343:08.07]I'll be right here.
[343:08.61]Alright.
[343:09.61]Go for it.
[343:09.97]As soon as I can.
[343:12.16]Oh, I jumped off.
[343:13.88]Oh, it's just me.
[343:15.72]Oh, shit.
[343:16.24]No, I'm behind you.
[343:17.36]Oh, thank God.
[343:17.96]You just saved my life right there.
[343:19.46]You're kind of screwed there, though.
[343:21.76]Uh, yep.
[343:23.32]My last ditch effort, I dropped a grenade.
[343:24.52]Maybe it can help.
[343:26.72]Ah!
[343:26.94]No.
[343:28.83]Well, it was good.
[343:30.81]Wait, what's happening?
[343:32.87]Oh, they're stuck.
[343:34.29]Criken's got the, um, you know, thing, which means that on hit, it drops a... I can't move.
[343:39.33]Nobody can hit Criken right now.
[343:43.39]He's safe.
[343:45.67]He's alive.
[343:46.93]He's going to be alive for about 10 more seconds until his charge runs out.
[343:53.24]Hurry up and get it back in here.
[343:54.50]Get those tacos.
[343:56.44]We did it.
[343:57.84]Yeah, I got a bomb.
[343:59.66]You guys, bad news.
[344:00.41]I haven't left yet.
[344:01.65]What?
[344:02.01]Oh, this is bad.
[344:06.09]This is bad.
[344:14.29]Now it's over.
[344:15.91]It is over now, actually.
[344:17.41]Now it's over.
[344:18.99]Wow!
[344:19.17]The same fucking gun!
[344:21.83]Hey, it wasn't me this time.
[344:23.20]I went BRB last day.
[344:24.56]It wasn't me this time.
[344:27.28]Done five times.
[344:29.64]Hey, I'm proud of you guys.
[344:33.40]We've never even made it past round two of the dice rolling.
[344:37.13]We made it all the way to go.
[344:38.35]We could have easily did it.
[344:40.11]We have a, there's a technique of just jumping off and restarting at the beginning.
[344:44.55]Yeah, it's pretty viable.
[344:45.69]You could see the end game of Monopoly.
[344:48.74]Yeah, I mean, oh man, it's so cool.
[344:50.78]Oh, never mind, the game crashed.
[344:51.64]Bottom fragging.
[344:53.92]Every time.
[344:56.40]God, it's too bad.
[344:57.58]I picked out a lot of, there's a lot of other levels, like a lot of clown levels and like creepy alien levels and Simpsons level levels.
[345:07.67]Just never get to them.
[345:09.17]Turkey Survival actually had fully modeled turkeys.
[345:13.09]Oh, man.
[345:14.17]They were the zombies.
[345:15.73]That's why I picked it.
[345:16.79]There was a legacy one from last stream where it didn't have any real purpose behind it, but every zombie was for some reason pseudo-Woodo, the Pokémon.
[345:27.02]I don't know why.
[345:28.26]There was no description why.
[345:29.66]It was just every zombie was pseudo-Woodo.
[345:31.86]It just was.
[345:33.30]They were just pseudo-Woodo, which was pretty cool.
[345:38.37]So you guys- you guys good to go? You want to wait- what's the-
[345:41.00]I don't know if I can host because James can't join me.
[345:44.00]Okay.
[345:45.00]But um we have to see what uh crikey boy wants to do since he's got his fucking gordita crunches.
[345:48.00]Ah, that's right.
[345:50.00]Yeah it's like more of a situation of how much longer you guys want to go, because there are plenty of maps.
[345:54.00]The maps will go forever, so it's like whenever people pull the plug is when we wrap up - because we're not going to run out of stuff to do it's just more of like, you know.
[346:04.46]You can only take so much.
[346:06.42]Call of Duty is zombies.
[346:07.14]You can only take so many memes.
[346:08.66]And then we don't come back to this for about a yearish.
[346:14.15]Are you going to keep the maps downloaded?
[346:15.75]Yeah, it's all in one ever-expanding map pack that I won't prune from the ones that we did.
[346:21.23]So anyone that is interested in doing part three in, like, nine months, they can enjoy a 400-gigabyte download.
[346:30.12]I couldn't believe that, seriously.
[346:31.42]Like, when he's like, oh, yeah, Criken said it's a really big file.
[346:35.44]I'm like, yeah, whatever, 10 gigs, 20 gigs.
[346:38.78]Yeah, it was huge.
[346:40.72]It was like my whole entire SSD.
[346:43.26]Yeah, it's a little gargantuan.
[346:44.94]I'll probably prove it.
[346:47.61]Yeah, the actual base game's like 60 or 70, isn't it?
[346:50.49]I think it's 90.
[346:51.15]It's like 89.
[346:53.23]Yeah, well, that's part of it.
[346:54.31]I think this was around... I think this was...
[346:57.31]I had to re-download the entire mod pack on stream.
[347:00.89]Like mine didn't download when we started.
[347:02.35]So I was just quietly re-downloading the whole mod pack.
[347:04.96]It was 150 gigabytes.
[347:07.06]So it's a little bit over double the game scale than at that point.
[347:11.54]So we're up at 250 ish.
[347:14.80]That's insane.
[347:15.50]I bet I can.
[347:16.44]Right.
[347:16.69]I mean, I went through, I got more or less everything that wasn't like completely garbage tier.
[347:20.67]Like obviously not worth playing.
[347:23.29]in this already so like honestly all that would be added for another session would be like new stuff and I don't know how much new stuff was the one on the the featured was the the the game of thrones one is that the one that's it looks like the same one that's featured this one was new game of thrones is the one that's featured yeah that one was brand new
[347:42.82]Came out on the 14th.
[347:44.18]Yeah.
[347:45.92]Like, they're still updated.
[347:47.04]There's still new mods being made for this.
[347:49.34]And some of them are honestly, like, if you look, like, a cursory look, James, you can see there's actually, like, good maps.
[347:54.34]Like, there are good zombies maps on this.
[347:56.59]Obviously, we didn't touch any of the actual good ones, but... I made it.
[348:00.33]Is Black Ops 4 or not?
[348:01.49]It doesn't have... Why Black Ops 3?
[348:04.57]I don't know why it's Black Ops 3 that's, like, the most...
[348:08.63]Don't all of them have it?
[348:10.35]Did we win?
[348:11.91]They don't have mods.
[348:13.61]Yeah, they didn't have the mod tools out.
[348:15.71]Yeah, they don't have workshop integration, and that's what's made this so popular.
[348:21.17]Did we win?
[348:22.29]No, we lost.
[348:22.85]No, we didn't win.
[348:26.13]You were invincible for like 15 seconds.
[348:27.66]We held out for one more round after you left, and then it went to shit.
[348:34.22]Oh, yeah.
[348:34.88]I remember Pokémon Sun and Moon now.
[348:36.66]I remember that one.
[348:37.63]No, it was bad.
[348:38.59]Yeah, I remember that one now.
[348:45.60]Well, I'll give you my... I'm down if you guys want to do any more.
[348:49.98]I'll be around for a little while.
[348:52.26]If we want to... We could play a wind-down one that's probably decent that I saw that actually intrigued me.
[348:58.20]Or we can play more trash garbage like Cheese Cube V Cheese.
[349:03.33]We've got options on both fronts.
[349:05.21]I will do anything.
[349:06.35]I'm good for another one.
[349:10.97]Your mic is really low.
[349:12.19]Quiet.
[349:13.69]I'm fine to stick around for a little bit longer.
[349:15.11]It's not like I have anything.
[349:17.63]Okay.
[349:18.11]Cheese.
[349:18.49]Uh-oh.
[349:18.73]What are we feeling?
[349:21.81]I can do either the meme one or the real one.
[349:25.27]I got a gordita crunch here with my name on it, but I'm also, you know, happy to wait.
[349:31.80]I don't mind.
[349:32.52]It's up to you guys.
[349:34.76]There's a lot here.
[349:36.88]Let's do two more then.
[349:38.08]Yeah.
[349:38.48]Okay.
[349:39.24]Let's do...
[349:40.73]This one looks like it would be pretty good.
[349:42.99]Like actually like a decent map.
[349:44.97]Actually good.
[349:47.03]Sure.
[349:49.43]It's like a Western themed cowboy one.
[349:51.51]That's an actual map.
[349:52.92]Called Wanted?
[349:54.92]Yeah.
[349:56.70]So is Cheese Cube just like a piece of absolute shit?
[350:00.59]He's assuming.
[350:01.83]Cheese Cube is inevitably going to be garbage trash.
[350:05.61]Go to Solo and look at the picture.
[350:07.93]Hover over the picture under the maps.
[350:10.19]You can see it on the cube.
[350:11.63]There's a lot of cheese-themed maps.
[350:13.95]All of them are completely garbage, and I don't know why a bunch of different people make these maps.
[350:19.23]Cheese Cube is God tier.
[350:20.61]This is what somebody just said.
[350:23.31]God dear.
[350:25.01]That's like the whole mentality of the meme is that you see someone makes a cheese cube map and you say, well, it must be good.
[350:29.90]And then you make a cheese cube map that's also fucking trash garbage.
[350:33.18]And then, you know, the cycle continues.
[350:35.90]Uh, I don't.
[350:36.58]Oh, there it is.
[350:37.00]Wanted.
[350:37.40]Okay.
[350:39.36]Now I'm only talking about like pictures that I saw.
[350:41.34]Wanted looked pretty good.
[350:42.52]Somebody said the cheese maps are challenge maps.
[350:46.11]I do like cheese.
[350:48.29]Cheese in the name.
[350:49.55]They're for high level zombies players only.
[350:53.37]That's us.
[350:53.73]Well, I'd say that's us.
[350:54.69]We almost beat Monopoly.
[350:56.17]We almost beat Monopoly.
[350:56.99]I mean, that's pretty good.
[351:01.11]I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I will.
[351:04.20]I had about like a 40%.
[351:04.94]Go ahead, do it.
[351:05.86]Nah, I don't like to do that.
[351:07.68]I had like a 40% headshot ratio.
[351:12.04]I didn't give her many kills.
[351:13.86]Criken, the lobby's not joinable.
[351:15.42]Can you invite me again?
[351:18.86]Hey, can you not do that to me?
[351:22.13]Sorry.
[351:22.51]I invite you.
[351:23.45]I know you're excited to eat that cheesy gordita crunch.
[351:25.98]Yeah.
[351:28.30]You probably... Oh, it's still not joinable.
[351:31.04]They're in here.
[351:32.22]I'm in here.
[351:34.68]It's not getting me... It's not getting me into my friend's game.
[351:38.32]Gotta tell you, I hear the... I can smell it.
[351:40.43]I hear... I can smell the cheese in this cheesy gordita crunch a mile away as I'm picking it up.
[351:48.84]It's got a pungent odor for sure.
[351:50.46]Yeah.
[351:51.20]I'm not gonna do a taco cam, guys.
[351:52.54]I... I look... I'm like the scum of the Earth right now.
[351:56.42]I'm like... I'm like hiding in a Twitch hoodie.
[351:59.22]I... I'm... I'm unkempt and I'm eating a cheesy gritty crunch.
[352:04.90]This is... I don't want you to know me this way.
[352:07.40]I'm gonna restart my game because it's not letting me in.
[352:12.85]I invite everyone to my party.
[352:15.41]They're texting each other at my party.
[352:16.85]Right in front of me.
[352:18.49]They're showing me the texts.
[352:21.16]That was a text between, you know, a private text that you saw.
[352:28.44]I put a happy face, dude.
[352:30.28]I gotta, oh my god, I gotta hand squeeze this fire sauce.
[352:40.59]What do you think I am?
[352:48.76]Oh god, wait, what happened?
[352:49.76]Oh, there we go.
[353:12.15]You fucking cut off?
[353:14.22]Your text message didn't receive.
[353:17.00]I called my mom?
[353:17.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[353:18.44]The game's starting.
[353:19.36]The game's starting.
[353:20.30]Don't leave me, man.
[353:22.36]What the fuck?
[353:23.12]Spoilers.
[353:24.54]Please.
[353:26.08]Dude, our fucking game's gonna crash, too.
[353:30.02]I didn't mean to.
[353:31.76]Sorry, guys.
[353:32.32]I wasn't even invited to the lame party.
[353:34.82]Oh, it's Red Dead Redemption, dude.
[353:36.59]Look.
[353:37.17]That looks really good, actually.
[353:39.45]Holy shit.
[353:43.62]Is that Dutch?
[353:47.28]Do the Dutch voice, man.
[353:49.08]Do I have to do it like a fucking monkey?
[353:51.06]You're the Dutch for one of us.
[353:53.90]I can't do it on command, dude.
[353:56.06]Dutch voice?
[353:56.48]Do a Dutch voice.
[353:57.07]Just crack your voice.
[353:59.71]I can't even join the lobby, Arthur.
[354:01.51]Arthur.
[354:03.89]Just put too much air in your throat.
[354:06.03]Invite me, Arthur.
[354:07.83]I need an invite now, Arthur.
[354:10.73]There's not enough...
[354:12.75]Mangles are here.
[354:14.55]Oh, this is so good.
[354:15.83]I invited you.
[354:16.63]Let me know if you can join.
[354:17.45]This is good.
[354:18.29]Uh-oh.
[354:18.41]It hasn't been, for some reason, your lobby currently is, like, super anti-letting me in.
[354:23.13]I don't know why.
[354:24.97]We can reset it if, uh... Yeah, I think we might need to do, like, a hard reset.
[354:28.75]You're wearing those light-up shoes.
[354:30.62]Yeah, it's just hard not joinable for me.
[354:32.86]Those Skechers light-up shoes?
[354:34.50]Yeah, those Skechers light-up shoes, man.
[354:38.56]There's lava in the middle.
[354:39.98]There's lava.
[354:40.78]This place is fucked.
[354:43.09]I told you guys I picked one good map.
[354:46.71]One good map.
[354:48.13]See, the problem is like now I accidentally sort of leak into Dutch voice like for the next... Yeah, and then you can't stream tomorrow because your voice... Yeah, and then my voice is fucked for the next day.
[354:58.54]You do too much Dutch and you get stuck in Dutch.
[355:01.12]Oh, no, dude.
[355:01.82]When Red Dead came out online and we were like playing Red Dead online a bunch, I genuinely couldn't talk for a week because I just kept like doing Dutch voice for like hours on end every stream.
[355:13.19]I invite.
[355:17.39]I try to join, and I hope it lets me.
[355:22.19]One last map, Arthur.
[355:25.88]One last map.
[355:27.18]I didn't realize how late, yeah, it is getting kind of late.
[355:29.14]Yeah, it's just not letting me in your lobby cranking.
[355:31.00]I don't know what's going on.
[355:35.06]Oh, no.
[355:35.38]Where is everybody?
[355:36.12]Where are you guys all from these days?
[355:40.43]Maybe I can join James's.
[355:41.75]Let me try.
[355:44.65]Well, I mean you guys.
[355:45.31]What do you mean where I'm from?
[355:46.63]It's you guys.
[355:48.18]Where are you all from?
[355:49.06]Are you talking to the viewers?
[355:51.62]No, I'm talking to you.
[355:53.62]I know where you're from.
[355:55.32]I'm just saying, where are you all from?
[355:56.86]We're just waiting in the lobby.
[356:00.63]I'll start.
[356:01.15]I'm from Las Vegas.
[356:11.53]So, wait, you want me to say, like, where I'm from?
[356:13.77]Yeah, like, where are you from now?
[356:14.67]Where are you doing now?
[356:15.53]I'm down the street from Criken.
[356:18.51]Are you serious?
[356:19.19]Yeah.
[356:20.61]Well, it's a long street.
[356:21.89]L.A.'
[356:22.03]'s got a lot of streets.
[356:23.79]It's a long street.
[356:30.52]Alright, the game's not letting me in.
[356:31.54]What an icebreaker.
[356:32.88]No.
[356:33.98]No, you guys go on.
[356:35.20]You guys thought I was asking my chat.
[356:37.01]Hey, where are you from, guys?
[356:38.89]Let's see.
[356:40.23]What if I change the map and then change it back?
[356:44.15]I guess.
[356:44.73]I mean, I don't know why.
[356:45.57]I can't even join, like, James or, like, anyone.
[356:47.49]I can't join on anyone.
[356:50.23]Did you already restart your game?
[356:52.06]Yeah, I restarted it once already.
[357:06.29]You go to any gambling casino anytime recently?
[357:12.87]What the fuck?
[357:17.38]Jeez, I'm sorry.
[357:23.48]No, why am I going back?
[357:33.07]Yeah, it's not letting me in.
[357:33.85]You guys should go ahead.
[357:34.43]I don't want you guys waiting on me.
[357:38.02]Start.
[357:40.90]Wait, it's not letting you in at all?
[357:42.22]It's not letting me in at all.
[357:43.38]Just go.
[357:43.88]Go, go, go.
[357:44.50]Someone else should host.
[357:48.41]Should I back out?
[357:50.33]I guess try that.
[357:51.19]If not, I want you guys to go ahead.
[357:52.49]I'm not even streaming, so I don't want you in.
[357:54.57]It did work.
[357:55.63]It worked when I hosted.
[357:57.11]I'm just going to reset.
[357:57.85]I'm just going to restart.
[358:04.81]Okay, yeah, I can join James.
[358:06.54]There you go.
[358:07.62]I'm just the weird one.
[358:08.48]Wait, what was the fucking math?
[358:09.34]Why did somebody skip $50?
[358:10.42]It was wanted.
[358:11.64]Wanted was what it was called.
[358:13.74]Rude.
[358:16.47]Ampscoot's $50.
[358:17.03]Jesus.
[358:19.80]I'm from New York.
[358:20.70]Thanks for not asking.
[358:21.56]I did ask.
[358:21.80]3 a.m.
[358:21.94]bits.
[358:22.12]Midnight bits.
[358:22.44]Thank you so much, though.
[358:23.32]It's very good.
[358:23.96]Remember when I made $2,000 earlier?
[358:25.08]Yeah, it was fucking insane.
[358:26.00]Look, I'm going to be honest.
[358:27.46]Thank you so much for the $50.
[358:28.38]I don't like Pepsi very much.
[358:39.60]You don't like Pepsi?
[358:40.52]Is Pepsi okay?
[358:41.88]Is it weird?
[358:43.52]I can't tell.
[358:44.08]If you gave me a glass of Pepsi and a glass of Coke, I would not be able to identify the difference because I don't really care about soda.
[358:50.35]They're pretty different.
[358:52.63]I don't feel like I could notice.
[358:54.83]I just don't care.
[358:57.03]Brave.
[358:58.51]Thanks, everybody.
[358:59.79]I was just going to say brave as well.
[359:01.63]Just squeeze.
[359:02.31]Just take a lemon and juice like a half a lemon.
[359:04.94]Squeeze the lemon into your water and just put it like a teaspoon of sugar and then Ster it up and drink it.
[359:08.46]Don't drink soap.
[359:09.28]It's bad for you.
[359:10.16]It's bad for your teeth.
[359:11.44]Are you saying like not to taste?
[359:13.72]Is that a PSA?
[359:14.78]Is that?
[359:15.74]What?
[359:16.52]Yeah, you're on the right one.
[359:18.34]If everyone can join James, it looks like he's on the right one.
[359:20.86]I'm gonna have to force crash steam, but I'm, you know, I'll be there in a second.
[359:25.40]I'm being like fucking crazy.
[359:27.53]Hey, thanks for the 10 community subs, Pim.
[359:32.45]Pinman, 10 community subs, thank you.
[359:34.07]I don't think I've ever tried RC Cola.
[359:35.91]How do you guys feel about RC Cola?
[359:37.94]I've never heard of it because I live out in the middle of fucking nowhere.
[359:40.62]Is that water with a lemon in it?
[359:42.14]I think that's more reason that you should probably have heard about it.
[359:45.64]Is that water with a lemon in it?
[359:47.56]You didn't squeeze the lemon into it.
[359:48.72]That's not my thing, so I'm not going to say anything.
[359:50.78]I'm not going to answer that.
[359:51.60]It's not for me.
[359:53.62]RC Cola is just like off-brand cola.
[359:58.09]It's like bootleg cola.
[359:59.95]But how do you get more bootleg than cola?
[360:01.23]I feel like they mass produce it enough that, you know.
[360:03.69]That's cheaper.
[360:04.61]Is RC Cola, isn't it like a full dollar per can cheaper or something?
[360:07.77]Yeah, it's cheaper, but I don't understand why, like, how do they make it cheaper?
[360:12.78]Because when you buy a Mac, you think like the Mac tastes better.
[360:16.58]That's the reason.
[360:18.24]It's like a... Oh, a computer?
[360:20.40]Yeah, it's like, it's a reason, it's a reason why... Why are you eating your Macs, dude?
[360:23.29]It's the reason why Macs are like fucking 30% more expensive.
[360:25.47]Dude, now I'm thinking about mac and cheese, man.
[360:27.43]Now I gotta go to eat some food.
[360:28.79]Big Mac.
[360:30.37]We're all on very different pages.
[360:31.91]Oh, God.
[360:32.91]I thought he said, eat a Mac.
[360:34.25]I thought... No.
[360:36.28]I just remembered I didn't have dinner or lunch.
[360:39.54]I'm dying.
[360:40.04]Am I supposed to be in a... Did I... What happened to my... Shut up.
[360:45.45]I'm trying.
[360:48.72]I'm late to my own party and everyone's texting the same.
[360:51.37]We're outside your house.
[360:52.67]Yeah, no one's even able to, like, text one another.
[360:56.07]We're just waiting.
[360:56.73]Your fucking lights are all off.
[360:59.39]Oh, dude, yeah, we should switch to Borderlands 2.
[361:01.33]Oh my god.
[361:03.81]I'm just gonna play a regular game of Call of Duty.
[361:06.00]I'm just gonna, like, stomp on some scrubs.
[361:07.84]Have you guys played Borderlands 2 recently?
[361:08.90]That game's pretty fun still.
[361:10.04]I played it recently.
[361:11.16]It was fun.
[361:12.28]Yeah, we've been doing, like, a co-op thing.
[361:14.02]I was asking the other two.
[361:22.62]Your session did not shut down properly.
[361:23.91]Would you like to start it in safe mode?
[361:25.09]No.
[361:26.15]Game sucks.
[361:27.11]Game sucks.
[361:27.69]Oh, my God.
[361:28.67]Oh, I have an idea.
[361:29.19]What if for this round, we all turn our resolution to the lowest possible... Did it get loud?
[361:35.43]Yes.
[361:36.01]You see what I do?
[361:37.45]I at least turn myself down before I ask if I'm loud still.
[361:42.15]There's my resolution.
[361:50.15]When am I gonna get a 5 at snapchat?
[361:51.25]That was just me laughing.
[361:52.23]Okay, where was I?
[361:52.79]Alright, everybody join.
[362:15.82]We're in one.
[362:17.71]This is exactly what the issue was before.
[362:21.03]Invite me, then.
[362:22.83]Coward.
[362:24.21]What?
[362:25.57]You can't just join?
[362:28.49]I'm joining you right now.
[362:31.74]I hope, at least.
[362:35.02]Ah, hey, look at that.
[362:36.64]What, am I supposed to be in yours?
[362:40.90]Combine parties.
[362:41.44]Oh, one or more...
[362:44.47]Wait, people have done the content install, it said.
[362:46.43]Oh no, that's my bad.
[362:48.83]Wait, what?
[362:50.53]Let me change the map.
[362:51.65]Alright.
[362:55.04]Now...
[362:58.37]But I'm in your game.
[363:00.35]What is happening?
[363:01.21]Should I not be here?
[363:03.07]I don't think you should be there, and I think you're confusing him by being there, man.
[363:07.08]Look, I'm figuring it out.
[363:07.98]He's the only person I have on Steam.
[363:09.08]I think you've got to get out of there, or else Criken's not going to know where he is.
[363:12.38]I'm good.
[363:12.72]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[363:15.76]Wait, no, I cannot join you guys now that he's in my lobby.
[363:18.12]Okay, I'm going to leave the lobby.
[363:20.91]Oh, no.
[363:22.65]We should have pulled the plug after Monopoly.
[363:26.05]Now you join me.
[363:27.55]Wait, what?
[363:28.03]No, you join us!
[363:30.89]Correct me.
[363:31.35]Okay, okay.
[363:34.87]Dude, I think there was something else in that Gordita.
[363:39.01]I haven't even eaten it yet.
[363:42.07]Go eat it!
[363:43.59]Just eat it in one bite.
[363:44.59]Everyone will think it's funny.
[363:45.53]Okay.
[363:51.24]No, don't do that.
[363:52.54]You have to enjoy it.
[363:55.43]My steam stopped working.
[363:57.89]Oh my god.
[363:58.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[364:00.60]I think I'm joining.
[364:02.34]Yes.
[364:02.66]I'm in.
[364:02.92]I can't invite him.
[364:03.44]I'm going to join off you right now.
[364:04.28]Fuck you.
[364:15.69]What's that?
[364:16.64]It's fucking Bane.
[364:18.30]What?
[364:19.56]Bane showed up for a second.
[364:22.00]There it is.
[364:23.54]Alright, everyone's here.
[364:24.48]Start it, start it, start it.
[364:29.06]Thank God.
[364:31.50]Look at those marshmallows you're roasting over there.
[364:34.71]There's a lot of zombies that don't seem to pay mind.
[364:38.49]Because for the first time ever, we're not carrying a weapon to hurt them.
[364:43.09]Think about it.
[364:48.55]This looks fun.
[364:51.27]They want us, Arthur.
[364:54.23]Those zombies, Arthur.
[364:56.01]Those zombies out there, they want us.
[364:58.77]And they're gonna have us.
[365:02.09]Those damn old Driscolls.
[365:05.63]Those damn old Driscolls.
[365:11.23]Oh God, it's happening.
[365:13.16]I'm a different character now.
[365:15.15]Oh No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[365:17.07]Oh, yeah, we're good if this game lags anymore I carry I'm gonna go back to Best Buy.

[365:34.23]Oh my god, my guys like the rich one look at my rings.

[365:39.72]That's great.
[365:40.50]Do I have like a steak?
[365:42.22]Or is this like a knife?
[365:43.14]What's this in my hand?
[365:44.52]I got a chicken for dinner, boys!
[365:46.00]Ooh, watch out.

[365:52.67]Alright, guys, don't stay on the lava.
[365:55.43]It burns you.
[365:56.55]Oh, God.
[365:57.17]It does exactly what it looks like it would do.
[365:59.21]Burn you.
[366:01.43]You can see the box, like the light in the air.
[366:04.11]Is anybody else's computer having some problems here?
[366:07.01]What is that?
[366:08.45]You're lagging?
[366:09.19]Yeah, I'm having some extra computer problems.
[366:12.60]Mine's fine.
[366:13.46]Mine's okay right now.
[366:14.70]Yeah, it's alright now.
[366:19.44]I mean, this game uses a lot of... Ooh, I stuttered there for a second.
[366:23.46]I think it's the particle effects of the... Why are you on fire again?
[366:26.63]I just wanted to see if I could jump it.
[366:29.77]Wait, where?
[366:30.11]What are we talking?
[366:30.75]This lava here?
[366:32.01]You can't jump it.
[366:33.65]Ow.
[366:34.25]What is this?
[366:35.76]Can you get in there?
[366:36.38]There's a horse in there.
[366:37.94]Shovel!
[366:38.22]Yeah, don't look at the train.
[366:40.17]Were you looking at the train, Criken?
[366:41.25]Uh-oh.
[366:41.81]Maybe.
[366:43.03]Don't look at the train.
[366:43.77]I think the particles of the engine... Oh.
[366:49.60]Particles of the train?
[366:52.62]Instant kill.
[366:54.02]Use your knives.
[366:54.54]Wow, they put a lot of effort into like... You've come a long way, Jer.
[367:00.99]look at all this look at that it's got like custom graphics and art and music and music can no one afford getting rid of this in the way max ammo
[367:22.30]I like the custom zombie models.
[367:23.58]I mean, this whole thing's custom.
[367:25.52]I don't think there's much of a sense, like, base game.
[367:27.96]Let's see if the guns are switched.
[367:32.58]So are these random guns?
[367:34.23]Yeah, I think so.
[367:35.81]Damn, man, a real level.
[367:38.17]A crossbow.
[367:38.97]I missed Taco Bell.
[367:40.09]Take too long to reload.
[367:44.83]I'm almost ready to open this thing.
[367:47.53]How much ammo can I put in this?
[367:49.92]Oh, a crossbow.
[367:50.74]Yeah, this is all, like, custom.
[367:52.16]These are custom weapons.
[367:52.74]This is cool.
[367:54.18]Is crossbow original?
[367:56.08]No, yeah.
[367:56.88]This is new, I think.
[367:57.68]This one specifically, yeah.
[367:59.28]Man, I like that.
[368:01.24]That's pretty fancy.
[368:05.20]Oops.
[368:05.46]There's a gun on this wagon over here as well.
[368:07.30]It even makes that dinky crossbow sound.
[368:10.23]This thing sucks.
[368:15.43]Oh.
[368:16.57]Why would anyone ever use this?
[368:21.24]Okay, I'm gonna open up the road.
[368:23.93]Got some cash.
[368:25.27]Come on, gang.
[368:25.83]I opened up the way.
[368:27.21]I spent a lot of money on this.
[368:29.47]Whoa!
[368:33.81]Oh man, I sent them more lava.
[368:35.63]Alright, don't- let's not kill that one.
[368:37.29]Oh, there's a gobble gum!
[368:39.03]I can finally pay to win!
[368:40.44]The gums are missing.
[368:41.16]Someone stole the gum.
[368:42.70]Gum?
[368:43.82]That someone stole all the gum.
[368:45.54]Oh, man.
[368:46.90]That's not cool.
[368:47.24]There used to be gum in this thing.
[368:48.72]Can we go in this... Oh, it's 1250 to open this door?
[368:51.14]1250?
[368:52.08]Hang on, there's some sort of Eldritch Heart here roped up to the wall.
[368:56.04]There's a lot of doors that, like, any of these... Wait, did someone open that?
[369:00.61]What Eldritch Heart?
[369:01.91]Look over here by me.
[369:02.83]There's someone roped an Eldritch Heart up.
[369:04.97]Oh, fuck.
[369:05.85]You think I was joking?
[369:07.33]No, he described it perfectly.
[369:08.91]You guys want to take a look at this gross Eldritch Heart?
[369:13.56]Ooh, pickaxe.
[369:15.46]Oh, man.
[369:17.34]I want that.
[369:17.99]That's a thousand bucks.
[369:22.19]I got it.
[369:23.17]What is it?
[369:24.95]It's a pickaxe.
[369:26.43]I'm gonna go play some Minecraft.
[369:28.13]I'll talk to you guys later.
[369:28.85]It's so cute.
[369:29.21]What are you even gonna do with that thing?
[369:30.57]I don't know.
[369:31.98]Oh, is this the box?
[369:33.52]Oh, we need another shovel and we can... Whoa!
[369:38.14]That was the most shocking thing we've all seen.
[369:42.08]This is a cool map.
[369:45.16]It's like a creepy cemetery.
[369:46.64]Oh my god.
[369:47.28]They got like a, look at this.
[369:48.64]We were just crowding around a street magician and he did something cool.
[369:54.55]Kaboom.
[369:54.93]Kaboom.
[369:57.57]Oh, I need 10 points.
[369:58.29]I could open up the saloon.
[369:59.47]Double points.
[370:00.31]No, I know you're not supposed to pull the last one.
[370:01.49]I think I just got us quadruple points by accident.
[370:03.72]Oh, yeah, right there.
[370:04.70]Oh god, that lag.
[370:05.54]What was that?
[370:07.40]Yeah, it's a tiny bit of lag.
[370:08.96]I opened it.
[370:10.02]Come inside and have a drink.
[370:15.98]It's open now.
[370:16.70]I got 23.
[370:17.16]I sound like Jeff Goldblum.
[370:21.82]Who told you that?
[370:23.08]I do.
[370:23.74]Your character?
[370:24.28]Like your character?
[370:24.86]Yeah.
[370:25.08]My character.
[370:25.62]Oh, I was like, what did you just hit me?
[370:27.48]I don't know exactly.
[370:28.70]I thought you were talking about yourself.
[370:30.16]Oh, no.
[370:31.10]I do not sound like Jeff Goldblum.
[370:32.36]Jeff Goldblum.
[370:33.90]There's a Molotov up here that you can get.
[370:37.54]Jeff Goldblum's one of those impressions that you can do.
[370:40.78]Jeff Goldblum's kind of like Owen Wilson, where you just have to make a certain cadence and noise over and over again, and you are Jeff Goldblum.
[370:48.95]Wow.
[370:50.35]They're pretty similar.
[370:51.53]They're pretty similar.
[370:53.37]Yo, this game, this mod has completely custom guns for everything.
[370:59.59]Yeah, ribbiolis.
[371:01.35]Yeah, that's like, I just got it.
[371:02.71]Look at this thing.
[371:03.47]Is it good?
[371:04.19]Yeah, it's like a machine gun.
[371:06.31]Wow, he's here.
[371:08.54]What in the fuck?
[371:09.64]Can you do anything with this up here?
[371:11.06]I think Jeff Goldblum and Nick Cage sound pretty... Nicholas Cage?
[371:18.24]What the hell is happening there?
[371:19.53]What was that?
[371:21.99]Yeah, actually, if you do the Owen Wilson... Bats!
[371:24.49]Giant bats!
[371:26.09]Whoa!
[371:26.73]Bats!
[371:27.03]Inside!
[371:29.67]I'm going inside.
[371:33.68]Oh, wow.
[371:34.34]This is new to me.
[371:35.64]Wow.
[371:36.80]Who am I?
[371:38.34]Am I Jeff Goldblum?
[371:39.26]And am I Nick Hager?
[371:40.06]Or am I Owen Wilson?
[371:40.74]I'll give you... Wow.
[371:41.36]Wow.
[371:43.50]Wow.
[371:44.24]Wow.
[371:45.36]Wow.
[371:46.40]Wow.
[371:46.80]Wow.
[371:49.78]Wow.
[371:51.40]Wow.
[371:53.62]Is this from a different Black Ops Call of Duty game?
[371:57.08]They're really well done.
[371:57.78]I don't think there's a way they modded this at this point.
[371:59.96]This must have been from a different Call of Duty and they ported it in, like the bats and stuff.
[372:04.46]What other Call of Duty has bats like that?
[372:07.16]There's a Western-themed zombies map in one of them.
[372:12.53]I don't think that is this.
[372:14.45]Bats behind us.
[372:15.41]Bats coming in hot behind us.
[372:17.81]I need a weapon.
[372:18.67]I'm too dumb to play this game.
[372:20.79]Here, come to me.
[372:21.61]Come to me.
[372:21.97]Inside the bar, there's a really good one on the stairs.
[372:24.89]Over here.
[372:26.07]Here, get one on the wall so you have, like, actual ammo to get back.
[372:29.03]This one's pretty good.
[372:31.95]Ooh, a Tommy guy.
[372:32.85]These paths are, like, stuck underneath the fucking bottom of the stairs.
[372:37.11]What is going on with this?
[372:39.44]Wait, this is just a Red or Black Ops 3 map?
[372:41.20]No way.
[372:42.26]No way we just played an actual map that wasn't a mod.
[372:44.56]Wait, this is not a modded map?
[372:47.41]This is not... No, this is a mod.
[372:48.59]This is a mod.
[372:49.13]This is not something built into the game.
[372:50.85]Oh, okay.
[372:52.25]Black Ops 3 has a Call of Cthulhu-type map and it has bad enemies.
[372:55.47]Okay.
[372:55.61]So, it was ported.
[372:56.07]Well, yeah.
[372:56.51]I mean... Okay.
[372:57.87]Yeah.
[372:58.37]The enemies make sense were ported.
[373:00.91]That was the map I was talking about.
[373:02.05]That was like a city.
[373:03.25]Where's that box?
[373:04.57]I want to get rid of this crossbow.
[373:07.89]Box is behind the saloon.
[373:09.71]Behind the saloon.
[373:11.74]Should we start opening more doors?
[373:12.70]I got a lot of money.
[373:13.24]Just look up into the air.
[373:14.94]You'll see the light.
[373:15.94]Oh, right, right, right.
[373:16.58]Oh, sorry.
[373:17.10]I didn't see you there.
[373:22.03]Should I go into the cemetery?
[373:23.35]I can go into the cemetery.
[373:26.01]Oh, a model 1887.
[373:27.95]Jerma is just this little sibling that your mom makes you take with you.
[373:32.33]Ban that guy for life.
[373:33.21]What?
[373:33.33]Someone's making fun of me.
[373:34.59]I just thought it was going to get banned for life.
[373:36.61]Your character is actually voiced by Jeff Goldblum.
[373:41.80]Is my chat shitting with me?
[373:44.54]Are they shitting with me?
[373:46.26]Or no?
[373:46.62]They don't see me.
[373:49.59]Oh, shit.
[373:51.53]I'm lagging all over the place on this map, though.
[373:54.67]I'm going to go into the jail.
[374:00.41]I opened the door to the jail.
[374:02.38]Cool.
[374:02.74]What's in here?
[374:05.17]Ooh, there's a Model 1903 in here.
[374:08.45]I got a part for some goop.
[374:10.63]In the cage?
[374:11.07]Is that what you... That was pretty good.
[374:15.79]Need to turn the power on.
[374:16.56]What about back here?
[374:17.64]Hold for part.
[374:21.36]I got a part two.
[374:24.02]I opened up this back way.
[374:25.92]The stables.
[374:27.02]Someone want to open up the way to the church?
[374:28.70]Oh, I found another part.
[374:29.54]We need a key for the church.
[374:31.10]Well, those people look... I don't feel bad.
[374:33.12]They went to heaven.
[374:35.42]What are you... What's going on?
[374:39.84]You need a key.
[374:41.68]Instakill.
[374:43.36]Instakill.
[374:46.46]I regret picking that up so quickly.
[374:47.78]Oh, I found a shovel.
[374:49.16]I can go back and... Oh, yeah.
[374:52.30]There's one over here, James.
[374:53.91]Behind the inn.
[374:56.29]There's so many places to go.
[374:57.53]There's one here, too.
[375:01.01]Where at?
[375:01.93]Right here.
[375:02.35]Right here.
[375:03.29]Right here.
[375:04.85]Some piles.
[375:06.56]What is that?
[375:07.14]Oh, dude!
[375:09.38]What the fuck?
[375:10.85]Gives you a power up.
[375:13.61]Oh, looks like this is where we turn on the power, but we need the key to open.
[375:16.65]Oh, God!
[375:18.75]Dude, I'm really liking this submarine aim down sights look here.
[375:23.88]Are you using that gun from the bottom?
[375:25.08]Yeah.
[375:26.02]It's really cool.
[375:26.98]It's got a good submarine attack recticle.
[375:33.27]I don't know if this is a mod though, this gun.
[375:35.79]It feels like too good to not be like made by a professional, you know?
[375:41.20]Oh!
[375:44.94]Max ammo.
[375:45.48]Nice.
[375:49.75]What happened to the crawler?
[375:50.49]There was a crawler over here.
[375:51.96]Oh, there it is.
[375:52.74]There's a crawler over here, and he's coming in with me.
[375:55.42]It's freaking me out.
[375:56.16]Can I close him in here?
[375:57.84]Close the door.
[375:59.06]I have another one over here, like a slower one, if you want to kill that one.
[376:03.42]Alright, I'll get him.
[376:05.45]How do we get the gum back?
[376:06.87]I want to fill up the gobble gum machine.
[376:08.77]How?
[376:12.55]Got the horses in the bag.
[376:16.21]Where does the shitter?
[376:17.43]What else do I do?
[376:19.13]2,900.
[376:20.11]Buy some more doors.
[376:21.71]I don't know where, though.
[376:23.07]There's a cemetery by the church.
[376:27.17]Oh, shit.
[376:27.81]I got a big revolver.
[376:29.53]Come back around 12 to get gums.
[376:33.28]Jesus.
[376:33.82]There's no way this is mine.
[376:36.38]What's that?
[376:37.32]What did I just see?
[376:39.12]Oh.
[376:39.92]Crank it.
[376:40.30]Take a look at this.
[376:42.53]Where?
[376:43.27]Does this look like a mod gun to you?
[376:45.63]It's like a big...
[376:46.95]Revolver rifle.
[376:47.77]Well, you're holding it kind of goofy.
[376:49.51]But, yeah.
[376:51.19]I found out how to turn on the power.
[376:52.69]I mean, it's like, it's all modeled and like animated and shit.
[376:55.89]So what does the power do?
[376:57.51]I think you just turn it on on the side of the house.
[376:59.56]I just turn a valve.
[377:00.50]There's a valve on the side of the house.
[377:02.46]And I guess maybe that power is just the house.
[377:04.32]Oh, wait.
[377:04.74]It did.
[377:04.88]It powered the jail.
[377:05.72]The machine in here is on.
[377:07.04]The PhD flopper.
[377:07.66]Nice.
[377:09.00]Ah.
[377:09.46]Whoops.
[377:13.34]I'm going to open the... What's this music?
[377:14.86]Is there any other places we haven't opened?
[377:16.69]There's a cemetery right here.
[377:18.01]Yeah, there's keys we need to open the rest.
[377:20.41]I opened the cemetery.
[377:21.47]I opened it both ways, and there's a bunch of things to dig with the shovel.
[377:25.42]James.
[377:26.38]What's up?
[377:27.08]Isn't that bad luck, digging in a cemetery?
[377:28.80]No, I'd do it anyways.
[377:30.62]James, get over here.
[377:32.66]Hold on, I'm about to... There's a... Wait, where am I going?
[377:34.85]What do you need me to do?
[377:35.81]Over here.
[377:36.19]Dig this hole.
[377:38.92]Dig up this.
[377:39.72]Uh, I'm a goner.
[377:41.62]Yeah, this person.
[377:42.26]Okay.
[377:43.22]I don't want no part of this.
[377:45.18]I gotta go around.
[377:46.42]No, come back.
[377:47.98]Oh, but you'll shoot the casket, the one that's out.
[377:50.76]What do you want?
[377:53.78]There's nothing in it.
[377:55.46]Oh, that's bad luck.
[377:58.22]We should probably open up the, uh... Y'all, should I, uh, buy this heart?
[378:03.97]Yeah.
[378:05.39]It's $1,500. $1,500.
[378:07.01]Buy it.
[378:07.91]Activates a trap.
[378:09.89]Oh, it activates a trap?
[378:11.05]Yeah.
[378:12.27]Wait, what are we waiting for?
[378:13.90]There's a crawler.
[378:16.52]Just buy up as much as you can.
[378:20.12]I'm going to hang out in the saloon.
[378:22.04]Is there a juggernaut anywhere?
[378:23.82]Or a juggernaut?
[378:24.40]No?
[378:27.38]Oh, I can craft an antler shield here.
[378:29.06]Guys, there's a shield where I'm standing that I crafted.
[378:31.83]Ooh.
[378:33.71]A shield?
[378:35.35]It's a shield.
[378:36.03]Yeah, it's like a... Can we... You can operate this minigun?
[378:39.85]Or is that something that just does it automatically?
[378:44.02]You probably gotta pay to do it.
[378:45.46]You guys want this shield?
[378:46.32]It's free.
[378:47.18]If you walk up and grab it.
[378:49.28]Yeah.
[378:49.46]Free stuff.
[378:50.26]I mean... Yeah, when you press 2, you can pull it out and you can push through a whole horde of zombies with a button press.
[378:57.26]It's really strong, actually.
[378:59.06]Oh, there's a little crawler.
[378:59.92]Huh?
[379:00.32]Can we get him?
[379:03.25]Ooh.
[379:04.27]I did that from across the map.
[379:07.25]Go over here.
[379:07.79]Grab this here.
[379:08.97]Oh, there's Juggernaug right here.
[379:10.03]What the fuck?
[379:10.77]Wait, where?
[379:11.37]Oh, I'm going over there.
[379:13.98]Now, none of us have enough.
[379:16.56]Where is it?
[379:17.32]We'll get it in this round.
[379:18.61]Take this.
[379:18.93]Take this down.
[379:23.39]No.
[379:25.53]Take the shield.
[379:26.59]Ow.
[379:26.73]It wasn't that far.
[379:27.63]That was like 2,000 kilometers away.
[379:29.97]Criken.
[379:31.83]Ah.
[379:32.09]What am I looking at that's like lagging every single time?
[379:36.40]Ah!
[379:38.16]This map is slowly killing my computer.
[379:41.16]I think it's the train.
[379:45.68]Ciao, Criken.
[380:04.77]Whoa, I just exploded.
[380:06.75]That's me.
[380:08.26]The Fleijerfaust.
[380:12.30]Double points.
[380:14.00]Double points.
[380:15.42]Rack them up.
[380:18.00]I'm getting that juggernaut.
[380:19.68]Oh boy.
[380:23.05]Wow, this gun is... Cross over the middle.
[380:30.99]Oh no.
[380:32.13]Oh, shit.
[380:33.29]Oh, there's another thing here.
[380:37.65]What is this?
[380:38.63]It's Taco Bell.
[380:39.32]Someone grab this.
[380:40.26]Someone grab this.
[380:41.10]What is it?
[380:41.72]Grab that.
[380:42.62]It's a sword.
[380:45.46]He's got it.
[380:47.22]Wow, look at that swing.
[380:50.08]What the fuck?
[380:51.60]Wow.
[380:52.80]I'm so powerful.
[380:53.34]That's the real Jon Snow's sword.
[380:56.83]Is it?
[380:57.43]I bet it looks so cool.
[380:59.21]It did look pretty cool.
[381:00.27]Alright, here we go.
[381:00.79]Let's see if it looks cool in practice.
[381:03.53]It looks cool because you're on fire while you're fucking swinging it.
[381:13.95]It's like always when I go- when I come down- He's down.
[381:18.00]Yeah, I'm down.
[381:19.52]He was- he died cool.
[381:21.22]I died cool though, I was on fire.
[381:22.92]That was what I wanted to look like.
[381:24.22]I think I can get it.
[381:25.18]No, I can't.
[381:25.96]Nice sword.
[381:26.54]I give up.
[381:28.67]Actually, no.
[381:29.33]With the power of the shield, I can get him.
[381:34.53]Oh, what the fuck?
[381:35.64]I can't get him.
[381:36.12]I keep on making this mistake.
[381:37.66]I keep on thinking I can help you.
[381:38.82]I can't help you every time.
[381:40.66]It's still fun, though.
[381:45.15]Can you make it?
[381:46.63]What's up, man?
[381:48.23]You got it.
[381:48.61]I think Cranky's got you.
[381:50.13]Oh, no.
[381:52.33]I'm sorry.
[381:52.99]James, get me.
[381:53.65]Now's your chance, man.
[381:55.11]I totally fucked that up.
[381:56.27]Now's your chance.
[381:57.17]Get me.
[381:58.57]It's alright.
[381:58.97]You guys just cut the anchor off.
[382:03.57]Carpenter.
[382:07.07]Carpenter.
[382:07.47]Ew.
[382:17.62]What's the matter with Carpenter?
[382:20.46]It ruins the flow of the zombies, man.
[382:23.15]Oh, oh, I'm concerned about the flow.
[382:25.61]It ruins the flow of the zombies.
[382:28.67]God, where'd you find this guy, Criken?
[382:29.95]I am frozen.
[382:33.59]Uh-oh.
[382:36.43]Where's the speed cola?
[382:39.37]I just want to eat my Gordito.
[382:40.81]Uh-oh.
[382:42.11]It's Gordito, you fake fan.
[382:44.82]I think I'm about to crash out here.
[382:46.06]Damn.
[382:47.29]No, no, no.
[382:48.77]There it is.
[382:52.18]I haven't gotten a max ammo in a long, long time.
[383:00.90]No.
[383:02.50]You alright?
[383:03.76]I'm crashing up.
[383:05.84]Oh.
[383:06.22]Like hardware, not like internet.
[383:10.00]What?
[383:10.64]Oh, no.
[383:12.18]Shit crashed?
[383:13.32]EM crashed.
[383:15.40]I'm down anyway.
[383:19.33]Well, it wasn't fucking cold.
[383:21.27]Not true.
[383:24.35]Damn, I'm like hard stuck in here.
[383:26.83]Black Ops 3 won't even close.
[383:27.85]You might have to go to Task Manager to close the game.
[383:31.95]This game does not crash clean, so...
[383:38.17]Kwaski, thanks for the five community subs.
[383:39.81]Thank you, Kwaski.
[383:43.56]You didn't see that.
[383:44.38]With the five, thank you so much.
[383:45.70]Did you find this fucking key yet?
[383:48.22]No, I think we're doomed, actually.
[383:50.22]Yeah, what?
[383:52.94]What happened?
[383:54.32]To be honest, I'm reaching the point where I'm pretty hungry for a gorgeta or something similar in my own home.
[384:00.88]I'd be down with you letting me die, honestly.
[384:04.09]No, I can't do that now, actually.
[384:05.37]I gotta get you guys up.
[384:08.58]It's like a hostage situation.
[384:11.52]It's a zombie blood here, if you really wanna.
[384:16.52]This was fun though.
[384:17.63]This was wild.
[384:18.29]Yeah.
[384:19.63]Thanks for joining.
[384:20.77]Yeah, I'm glad you had a good time.
[384:22.25]It was, uh... Are you fucking eating right now?
[384:24.53]Yeah, dude, I had the gordito.
[384:25.55]Damn it.
[384:25.95]So, okay, what do you think?
[384:27.29]I was just about to get him up too.
[384:30.11]How is it?
[384:31.84]Let me die.
[384:32.64]Don't send me back.
[384:34.26]Let me die.
[384:35.26]Let them take me.
[384:36.08]Get away from me.
[384:37.24]Get away!
[384:37.74]Help!
[384:39.66]Help!
[384:41.44]No!
[384:43.89]Welcome back.
[384:44.79]Criken, I'm not going to be able to go to sleep tonight unless I know how much you like it.
[384:52.93]James is making me play with him.
[384:57.29]I got a bomb too.
[384:58.51]I cleared it for you.
[385:00.29]Oh, thanks.
[385:01.65]No problem, man.
[385:03.04]We're going.
[385:05.18]Man, I'm... No!
[385:06.00]No!
[385:06.96]You know how much fucking money... I have like... Oh, my God.
[385:13.18]This fucking guy.
[385:14.10]Criken, just close... Oh, wait.
[385:15.35]He's the host.
[385:15.87]You can't... Oh, good.
[385:17.13]Criken, can you just DM me what you think of the cheesy gordita crunch?
[385:20.49]I can't go to sleep unless I know.
[385:22.07]Just around.
[385:27.28]Yeah, we got like ghosts after us.
[385:29.57]What the f- It just stole money from me.
[385:33.49]Oh.
[385:34.35]What are you talking about?
[385:35.81]Oh my god.
[385:36.05]These ghosts steal money.
[385:37.29]They steal your money.
[385:38.21]They steal like 200 bucks.
[385:40.05]They steal your fucking money.
[385:41.65]Take that!
[385:50.42]Somebody said I'm horny for Taco Bell.
[385:52.94]What does that even mean?
[385:54.28]Who isn't nowadays, you know?
[386:06.43]You guys alright over here?
[386:08.21]No, I want, I want this to end.
[386:10.39]I'm so hungry, and now that everyone's eating and talking about fucking Taco Bell, it's killing me.
[386:15.14]I don't think I'm gonna die for a while, man.
[386:20.60]And until then, I shall remain slouched back in my chair, audibly, like, zenned out in my microphone.
[386:31.25]Cricut, get up!
[386:33.29]No.
[386:34.35]Cricut, get up!
[386:36.56]Did I just get the key?
[386:39.55]Did I get the key?
[386:42.97]What was that?
[386:44.29]I don't know, man.
[386:46.77]I don't know.
[386:47.11]It didn't tell me.
[386:48.07]Alright.
[386:48.41]One gordito down.
[386:49.33]Oh, my God.
[386:50.34]What do you think?
[386:50.88]What do you think?
[386:52.02]It's good.
[386:52.52]I mean, it's good.
[386:53.76]For right now, I'm... What do you mean for right now?
[386:56.54]What does that mean?
[386:57.50]For right now.
[386:58.88]Like, in the moment, I'm like, that was great.
[387:01.12]I'm happy I have another one.
[387:03.19]I don't know how I'm gonna feel 30 minutes from now.
[387:05.19]How many did you get?
[387:06.25]Two.
[387:06.99]That was your mistake and now you know why.
[387:10.77]You made a fucking driver come out there for two fucking... You should have done three.
[387:14.71]That was a mistake.
[387:15.73]A really mean mistake.
[387:17.28]What?
[387:17.64]Why are you turning on me so fast?
[387:19.48]I think I made a pretty good recommendation.
[387:21.16]That's a $50 tip.
[387:28.57]Alright.
[387:29.79]Sorry.
[387:30.67]Sorry I was curious about that new... thing.
[387:33.64]They were probably just sitting there going, this motherfucker giving me fucking two fucking Tuesday good fucking days.
[387:37.74]He got paid either way.
[387:41.54]Like seven bucks worth of food.
[387:45.02]No, it was like 12.
[387:46.28]12 bucks.
[387:47.93]Oh, James, this one dropped the key.
[387:49.89]I just got it.
[387:50.49]You're welcome.
[387:52.35]Oh, yes.
[387:53.25]We're going to fucking... Oh, in.
[387:56.19]Oh.
[387:57.03]Stop cursing.
[388:00.44]Yeah.
[388:02.42]It's a portal to the future.
[388:03.64]Oh, don't worry.
[388:04.30]It's not open yet.
[388:06.00]What?
[388:07.34]I'm going to open your stream.
[388:09.20]I want to see what's going on.
[388:10.38]I can't see anything.
[388:11.44]Oh, shit.
[388:12.74]No.
[388:13.60]No.
[388:14.66]He's dead.
[388:16.04]We can be free, Criken.
[388:17.34]We just have to kill him.
[388:19.26]No.
[388:19.62]We have to let him die.
[388:20.82]Oh, I got you.
[388:21.82]You have to get me up.
[388:23.16]You have to.
[388:25.58]Oh, they got me.
[388:26.46]I'm sorry, James.
[388:27.56]They knocked me down.
[388:30.32]They knocked me down, James.
[388:33.01]He's so far away.
[388:33.97]Don't worry, Criken will get you and me.
[388:37.71]You have to get me.
[388:38.41]They actually did knock me down.
[388:40.33]I was trying to get you.
[388:42.17]I just want to look at an image of it.
[388:46.64]Nice.
[388:46.96]Stop, man.
[388:50.31]I don't have, like, Postmates or things to order food with, so I actually have to just think about the Taco Bell Cheesy Gordita Crunch, and I don't get to act on that urge.
[388:58.94]Oh, thanks for the rest, man.
[389:02.40]My buddies used to get these urges to go fast food, but when, you know, you get lazy, you'd always, it's true, you always end up just going, if you don't have food, you don't have the means to get some, you know, restaurant near you or something.
[389:16.35]It was always a bowl of cereal, fuck, suck, that sucks, you know what I mean?
[389:21.65]Or a bologna and cheese sandwich.
[389:23.41]It's just like, it's never the same.
[389:24.65]Sounds like some fucking first world problem.
[389:26.77]It's so boring.
[389:27.23]It's definitely the same.
[389:28.61]You know what I mean?
[389:29.77]Like a bowl of cereal.
[389:31.39]Oh, you guys all get to act like that, but that is what I'm going to do when I go upstairs.
[389:34.96]I don't have options like you, alright?
[389:36.94]No, it used to be like that.
[389:38.04]I'm going to go upstairs.
[389:38.88]I'm going to open my fridge.
[389:39.78]I'm going to go, eh, turkey sounds good.
[389:41.62]I'm going to pull out like a slice of turkey and put it in my mouth.
[389:44.76]And that's my fucking day, alright?
[389:46.34]Because I can't just...
[389:48.02]Alright, here's the situation, okay?
[389:49.78]I can't like, they had Postmates here where I live for like a day, and then the driver was like, fuck that shit, and he 180-degreed right out of town.
[389:57.29]He left.
[389:58.55]And since then, I've been out here in the sticks alone.
[390:02.01]I used to eat a dry ass, one slice, one slice.
[390:05.69]Dry ass.
[390:07.55]I used to eat dry ass every day.
[390:08.97]No mayo, nothing.
[390:10.43]It was just a dry sandwich with a piece of bologna and a piece of cheese.
[390:14.40]And I was like, this sucks.
[390:15.06]When you're deprived options, you get, like, honestly, like, there's no, at a certain point, there's no creativity in my meal.
[390:20.96]Like, I just, like, there's no options, so I might as well just eat the most absolute basic shit, you know?
[390:26.98]That's what it comes down to now.
[390:28.66]And it always, you open up the pantry or whatever, and you just eat it.
[390:31.34]It's something so basic that you can't even stand it.
[390:34.14]It's like cornflakes or something.
[390:36.62]It's just like, God, why didn't I buy, like, the s'mores cereal for this very reason?
[390:42.75]Yeah.
[390:43.70]I mean, my situation is that, like, I only go shopping, like, once, like, a week.
[390:46.93]And I end up blowing all the nice stuff I would have eaten over the course of the first two days.
[390:49.95]And the rest of the fucking week is, like, a ramen.
[390:53.69]Fucking bagel.
[390:54.67]Like, for, like, the next five days.
[390:56.05]Yeah.
[390:56.33]Shaking my head the whole time.
[390:57.45]Dude, I do the same thing with, like, drinks.
[391:00.41]I go get, like, a carton of orange juice and it's gone in two days.
[391:02.81]Yeah.
[391:05.21]This will last me a week.
[391:06.93]And I drink the whole thing in a day.
[391:08.96]Yep.
[391:10.35]I'm like, yeah, no, then I'm sitting there because I can't order new stuff and it's too inconvenient to take the trip back.
[391:15.31]I'm glad someone finally understands me, man.
[391:17.17]That's really what it comes down to.
[391:18.73]It feels like all these people from the city, man, they don't... Wait, you guys... He just said he was from Vegas earlier.
[391:26.67]He's lying to you.
[391:28.11]No, no.
[391:29.15]I live in Vegas now.
[391:33.92]I just was trying to use empathy to be a friend.
[391:38.18]I trusted you.
[391:40.79]I'm taking my bagels elsewhere.
[391:42.40]Yeah, in Vegas, I could go walk down the street and find, like, a five-star steak right now.
[391:49.80]What is it, 2 a.m.?
[391:50.82]Dude.
[391:55.10]God.
[391:56.00]Alright.
[391:56.38]After that, I got to go.
[391:57.32]I got to eat something.
[391:58.14]I got to find, like, some slop to put in my mouth.
[392:02.54]Well, it's been fun, guys.
[392:03.58]Thank you for humoring us in our chaotic adventure.
[392:12.07]Follow all their channels.
[392:13.39]Everybody's still here.
[392:15.71]They're all swelled.
[392:16.83]I'm still here.
[392:18.11]Oh, I'm not muted.
[392:18.69]Sorry, I thought I muted.
[392:19.39]Oops.
[392:23.27]I was telling you, like, you guys are all fucking cool, you know?
[392:27.20]I heard him say, don't follow all their channels.
[392:29.68]What?
[392:29.88]I didn't say that, did I?
[392:33.68]I think he just said that.
[392:34.82]I definitely heard that.
[392:36.43]Well...
[392:37.62]That killed the mood for me.
[392:38.88]I'm going to go.
[392:40.62]I didn't say that.
[392:41.82]I did not.
[392:44.80]Turn the squad thing off.
[392:46.30]Yeah, we're turning it off.
[392:47.19]Alright.
[392:47.75]I'm not going to support this behavior.
[392:52.13]No, not the squad.
[392:53.89]Anything but the squad.
[392:55.99]At least the squad.
[392:56.91]Keep the squad together.
[393:00.30]Alright.
[393:00.58]See you guys.
[393:01.42]Have a good night.
[393:01.92]For real.
[393:02.26]Take it easy, guys.
[393:05.63]Did I actually say... No, I didn't say don't.
[393:08.45]Does somebody have a clip?
[393:14.48]Squad's gone.
[393:17.02]No, honestly, that was UberHexoNova.
[393:20.62]That was Kryken and Tomato.
[393:24.90]Please give them a follow.
[393:26.42]They're all hilarious.
[393:27.04]They're all great.
[393:28.14]Great dudes.
[393:35.85]Squad morale broken.
[393:38.97]So I'll see you tomorrow.
[393:40.67]We are going to probably play Calahuares tomorrow.
[393:46.81]Unless something else comes up.
[393:48.20]Maybe, I don't know.
[393:49.60]Anything could happen.
[393:54.86]Thank you so much for the thousands of dollars.
[393:57.44]It's not even a joke.
[394:01.16]We're going to go through the bits.
[394:02.40]We went through a lot of them in the beginning of the stream already.
[394:04.56]Because there was an actual shitload of them, so... If you take it off, I'll see you tomorrow.
[394:11.85]Not going to start at 6pm, 6.30 tomorrow.
[394:14.95]It's going to start at the normal time, between like 3 and 4.
[394:21.11]Will ever stream with Nova?
[394:22.69]Yeah, I mean, anytime that these guys want to play, of course.
[394:28.48]You know, it's just whenever it happens, it happens, right?
[394:35.17]But let's get the... It is getting late, so I want to kind of... It's very late.
[394:42.85]It's almost 4 o'clock in the morning, Eastern, so... I'm going to turn this off, because it's loud.
[394:55.68]And let's go back.
[394:56.58]About six and a half hours ago...
[395:01.74]So I'll be starting at like 3 or 4.
[395:04.64]Normal time tomorrow.
[395:09.27]Not like it was today.
[395:11.99]But we had the insane $1,700, almost $1,800 from somebody named Jermis Massive Dong.
[395:26.47]It was fucking out of control.
[395:28.63]It was a lot of money.
[395:31.74]I... Not much else to say on that.
[395:39.00]That's how we started it out.
[395:40.38]FrodeanWeapon gave 250.
[395:45.07]Regardless of the start time, these streams are always a hoot.
[395:49.17]jermaHeart, we appreciate you.
[395:52.83]I appreciate you too.
[395:55.45]Yeah, I wouldn't have started this late unless there was a reason to push it forward by that much, which obviously... Pretty good reason.
[396:03.63]It's always fun.
[396:05.99]I'm sorry I wasn't really that great at Black Ops Zombies tonight.
[396:09.15]It was the only experience I've ever had.
[396:12.34]I've never played it.
[396:15.02]And I don't play Call of Duty either.
[396:17.18]So, it was still fun.
[396:22.19]Oh, then we had... After the, like, two grand of insanity...
[396:29.96]Dorkcube gave 250.
[396:30.86]I'm hiding my bits next to Mr. Moneybag's donations.
[396:36.39]They still got through.
[396:39.63]You may have been the worst player I've ever seen.
[396:41.77]Yeah, but like... I don't even know what any of these guns do.
[396:49.83]I don't even know what... I don't know what the power-ups are.
[396:52.06]I have no... I don't know how you... Literally none of these systems.
[396:58.58]I've never seen...
[397:01.31]Just shoot gun at monsters is all I knew.
[397:17.08]Just shoot.
[397:17.80]I didn't even do the tutorial.
[397:24.29]I'm talking like the Black Ops 3 tutorial.
[397:26.21]The last time I opened a Call of Duty game was... I think Modern Warfare 3.
[397:33.37]Well, Black Ops 2, maybe.
[397:34.91]Like, 10 years ago.
[397:35.91]I... I don't know.
[397:44.50]And nothing has changed.
[397:45.64]Yeah, but I'm not playing zombies.
[397:46.78]It's like a completely different game mode.
[397:55.68]Uh, but Drosophila, thanks for the $5.
[398:02.35]They say hi.
[398:03.09]Hi.
[398:08.67]There was so much money earlier.
[398:10.87]Seriously, it's... I'm looking back and I'm getting... Getting overwhelmed a second time in a row.
[398:20.00]This is thousands of dollars.
[398:21.96]Like six hours ago.
[398:23.44]Jesus.
[398:27.28]Comfort Eagle, $55.
[398:29.06]Heard there was a bit party.
[398:31.00]Surgil, but $10.
[398:32.48]Small bit energy.
[398:34.66]No, that's still a lot of money.
[398:37.03]Trident Jacks, thanks for the five dollars.
[398:39.45]Love you, Jerma.
[398:39.93]Happy to see some more custom zombies.
[398:44.71]Yeah, it was still interesting.
[398:50.40]My favorite level was probably the... No, what was my favorite level?
[398:54.80]Probably the Game of Thrones one.
[399:02.30]That was just cool.
[399:03.14]It was fun and funny.
[399:07.35]But thank you, Trident Jacks.
[399:09.79]It was a good first ever experience.
[399:13.04]Nicknamed Jack, thanks for the $2.50.
[399:14.52]We require ads.
[399:16.84]Yeah, but I don't have to give them to you.
[399:25.58]You know, I don't want to give you ads.
[399:28.88]But thank you for the $2.50.
[399:31.04]LocoRoco gave five community subs earlier in the chaos.
[399:34.54]I think I may have missed them.
[399:35.33]Thank you.
[399:38.37]The Zally, thanks for $10.
[399:39.77]I might not be an oil tycoon, but I wanted to join.
[399:43.69]Thank you for the $10.
[399:46.61]Nebula Brand, five community subs.
[399:48.69]Turtle Toenail, $10.
[399:53.63]This is no longer a COD stream.
[399:55.07]This is now a bit stream.
[399:56.21]Yeah.
[399:59.53]Wolfgang, $10.
[400:00.23]Here you go.
[400:01.86]This is the first time I've ever given bits.
[400:05.28]And it's wildly appreciated.
[400:09.20]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[400:13.68]Zolnog, thanks for the five dollars.
[400:16.36]Just five bucks, thank you.
[400:17.92]No message or anything, just five bucks.
[400:19.67]Thank you.
[400:24.51]Roguefort, ten dollars, thanks for the ten bucks.
[400:28.69]They say my turn dollar signs.
[400:32.79]thank you no one is under any obligation to pay me money and sometimes like two three grand come through yeah it's thank you for everything thanks for the money thanks for the support thanks for the viewership thanks for letting me live my dream seriously like it's unbelievable I can't even believe I'm having this conversation that that much money is coming through
[401:03.56]It's fucking remarkable to me.
[401:07.70]Thank you.
[401:13.54]Flimflam, $10 from Flimflam.
[401:16.20]Surely such a massive streamer getting such a massive amount of money, mainly from one massive dong, warrants a massive stream announcement for the near future.
[401:25.73]Well, I already talked about this.
[401:27.55]This stream paid for the dunk tank stream.
[401:31.11]That might cost a few thousand dollars at least.
[401:34.41]So, there it is.
[401:41.07]Depending on what needs to happen.
[401:48.36]I probably should hear back from my source soon on that too.
[401:54.68]You'll get more info later.
[401:58.64]But thank you Flim Flam for the ten bucks.
[402:05.47]An anonymous cheerer, thanks for the $2.50.
[402:08.82]They just say, anonymous $2.50, thank you.
[402:15.36]Thank you for the $2.50.
[402:18.82]We had Jerma's Dong is average for $15 come in.
[402:25.09]$30, actually.
[402:26.37]They say 12 inches is average, by the way.
[402:32.07]Not so...
[402:35.00]Thank you.
[402:36.52]Great Canadian Fuck Club threw their hat into this insane money stream in the beginning with 10 community subs earlier.
[402:43.70]Thank you so much.
[402:46.18]A lot of community subs, too, in the middle of all this.
[402:50.11]Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[402:52.71]Jerma, I apologize in advance.
[402:53.99]I haven't watched you in a while, and I'm currently starting with the Sekiro streams.
[402:56.89]Sorry I haven't been catching up.
[402:58.33]What memes have I missed?
[403:00.99]Depends on how long.
[403:02.89]There's a lot.
[403:06.32]A lot of things.
[403:08.10]And Swiggity Swanky again, $250.
[403:09.20]Why are you playing Black Ops?
[403:11.94]What year is it?
[403:12.84]And then it's a Twitch clip.
[403:19.53]The Twitch clip is, I believe, this is Grandpa.
[403:22.21]So here's an example.
[403:23.63]Has anybody in here seen the new movie with Adam Sandler with his big balls?
[403:28.65]Wow, you're old.
[403:35.57]Yeah, it's been a long time.
[403:36.47]That's what I'm saying.
[403:37.07]It's been a long time.
[403:39.53]That may be one of the last times I ever played the game.
[403:41.59]That was like six years ago.
[403:48.31]And I didn't even play that.
[403:49.09]That was Grandpa.
[403:50.99]You know?
[403:53.31]Mr. Biffy, thanks for the $4.
[403:54.93]Jerma, why does your door look like it's screaming?
[404:01.28]It does kind of have like a scream face, doesn't it?
[404:09.21]But thank you for the $4.
[404:11.65]Thank you, Thomas Wynn, for the $5.
[404:16.78]They say, Hello, Jeremy.
[404:17.80]Me and my friend made a short film called Rumble, inspired by your characters from the Jerma universe, including you, a beer and trench coat guy, and Dick Dastardly Richard from the Rat movie.
[404:28.63]We make this movie for you, your excellence.
[404:30.73]We think you're amazing and hilarious.
[404:32.05]Anyways, here it is.
[404:38.93]Rumble Let's take a look here There's a link to it.
[404:51.01]This is 20 minutes long I don't really have time to play this now This is a full episode of television It's a long one I might open with this tomorrow
[405:07.14]Because it's very, very late.
[405:09.52]It's like 4 a.m.
[405:10.52]Eastern.
[405:11.44]I'd rather do this when it's not so, so late.
[405:15.72]This is fucking... I'm not going to scroll that far, but this looks like it's very well made.
[405:22.01]Make sure to remind me to do this tomorrow.
[405:26.17]Because this is like a full episode of television.
[405:27.76]This is a full movie.
[405:30.16]They weren't kidding around.
[405:35.14]Or, you know what?
[405:36.26]Friday is going to be a chill day.
[405:38.29]We'll just do it Friday.
[405:43.49]Because tomorrow I'm going to play a game, but Friday we're just going to do whatever.
[405:50.13]So, remind me on Friday that we're going to watch this.
[405:52.83]Seems like something good just to do, right?
[405:59.38]What am I playing tomorrow?
[406:00.20]The plan is to do Kalahwara as Gunslinger.
[406:04.49]Unless something else comes up.
[406:06.33]I'm not sure, we'll see.
[406:09.13]Tomorrow is Friday.
[406:10.19]Yeah, but you know what I mean.
[406:11.35]Like, not tomorrow, not Friday's stream.
[406:15.76]I mean, not Thursday's stream, Friday's stream.
[406:18.66]Because Thursday technically is today, right?
[406:28.28]But, Thomas Wynn, thanks for the $5 and this incredibly highly produced video that we're going to watch on the chill Friday stream.
[406:41.88]I'm not sure how long the stream will be on Friday, but I kind of want to get something out there.
[406:47.74]We'll do a few fun things.
[406:51.61]But thank you.
[406:54.43]It was.
[406:54.69]It was fun.
[406:55.13]I feel like it took me, like, a couple hours to kind of get into the element in the zone there, though.
[406:58.52]We just came from VRChat.
[407:02.32]Not even 24 hours ago.
[407:03.12]And just dump into, like, Candy Land.
[407:23.59]It was a little overwhelming at first, but it was all... after like a couple hours it started to click and it was a lot of fun.
[407:35.41]But thank you, Frodeon, it was fun.
[407:46.54]I do not like it, it's got candies.
[407:54.20]Felt like it fizzled at the end.
[407:55.76]Yeah, I mean, at the one, I just was kind of getting tired.
[407:58.72]It was kind of very easy to tell.
[408:05.39]The good four and a half to five hours in the middle there was an absolute blast.
[408:10.77]Took me about an hour or two to understand the game mode and really get a click for it.
[408:16.16]Then we started having a great time, and then I got tired.
[408:19.34]I thought I had a lot of fun though.
[408:31.60]You learned VRChat pretty quick?
[408:33.97]Well, I mean, that's just kind of walking around and looking at stuff.
[408:36.69]And, like, talking, you know?
[408:41.69]Uh... Thank you, Das.
[408:44.69]DasTech.
[408:46.23]For the $10.
[408:50.28]Say something about Daffy Duck.
[408:52.88]Is... Something about Daffy Duck, like, having sex.
[408:59.80]Thank you for the $10? $10?
[409:07.67]Appreciate it.
[409:11.87]Pretty support, thanks for the $10.
[409:13.51]Run a commercial?
[409:15.21]You just paid me $10 to tell me to run a commercial to make money.
[409:22.35]What?
[409:27.40]Here you go.
[409:27.98]Hey, here's $10.
[409:29.14]Can you run a commercial?
[409:30.30]You just paid me to run a commercial.
[409:35.35]I'll do it at the end.
[409:35.95]We'll do one 30 second ad at the end of the stream.
[409:40.31]It's 4am here.
[409:41.01]I just woke up in the morning.
[409:41.87]Is he still here?
[409:42.53]Was it a good stream?
[409:43.24]It's a fucking great stream.
[409:48.34]Excellent.
[409:49.76]One of the best.
[409:58.98]Ads are a meme, though.
[410:00.08]I don't know why.
[410:01.94]Thank you, Goldfish Vendor, for the $5.
[410:04.79]With all the money you got tonight, you can finally get that height enhancement surgery.
[410:07.85]That probably costs like $45,000.
[410:10.29]That's probably like 50 grand.
[410:15.68]I don't know.
[410:16.10]I never looked it up.
[410:17.26]I'm just guessing.
[410:20.22]I just got here.
[410:20.78]How was this frame?
[410:22.02]One of the best.
[410:23.82]Top 10.
[410:29.65]Hey, thanks for the $5, though.
[410:34.34]I don't need to do a height enhance, but... Just... Get Dr. Scholl's inserts and put them in, and I'll go up to 5'9".
[410:42.92]Thinking face.
[410:45.18]You can use that.
[410:45.76]If you want.
[410:50.66]Uh, Klosky, thanks for the five community subs.
[410:53.53]Evil Fish.
[410:55.13]Five community subs right now.
[410:57.57]Five minutes ago, ten minutes ago, thank you.
[411:05.16]lots of community subs and speaking of those subs why don't we show them on the screen right now that sounds like a plan I just got here how was the stream it was pretty awful I like didn't get zombies at first people were talking about how I'm so dumb and bad at zombies and I was like dude come on I made a joke and like franken said that wasn't funny shut the up and I was like and I had to like mute
[411:35.14]At one point, I peered into Nova's DMs and he was just like, dude, I don't want to fucking hang out with this guy anymore.
[411:40.60]Like, how do we get rid of him but not be like a dick about it?
[411:42.82]And I, like, pretended I didn't see it.
[411:54.04]No, it was one of the fucking top ten streams of the year.
[411:58.82]I'm not going to even... Just watch it and you'll see.
[412:01.96]It was high quality.
[412:08.92]I don't know about that.
[412:16.40]But thank you.
[412:16.90]There was a lot of community subs.
[412:18.90]Let's show them right now.
[412:20.69]They're going to blast by you.
[412:21.95]Just wait.
[412:23.61]There they come.
[412:26.13]I will see you tomorrow.
[412:30.15]Like I said, we're going to do four days in a row.
[412:34.04]Because if you didn't join us earlier, my mother's coming in and I'm going to spend like about a week with my mother.
[412:39.22]I'm not going to be streaming for about five straight days.
[412:45.16]Thanks again as always for watching and thanks again for the fucking like me with like hitting a lottery, like a scratch ticket at the beginning of the stream.
[412:54.27]I won like $3,000 in the very beginning.
[412:58.67]So that's insane.
[413:01.91]Thank you.
[413:03.48]Show mom on stream.
[413:04.49]My mom doesn't want to be on stream.
[413:08.11]No, my mom doesn't really want to be on stream.
[413:10.91]She was on stream once and she doesn't want to do it again.
[413:14.95]Hey, PikaBanana, thanks for the $2.50.
[413:15.97]Love you, Jerma.
[413:16.85]Appreciate every stream.
[413:18.09]Say Jerma Hart.
[413:19.11]Thank you, PikaBanana.
[413:20.75]Thanks for coming out.
[413:21.31]You come out a lot.
[413:26.00]So, thank you.
[413:29.12]Mom stream or Riot?
[413:30.36]No, I don't...
[413:33.34]I'm not going to do that.
[413:34.72]She doesn't want to do it.
[413:35.44]3 to 4 p.m.
[413:45.68]tomorrow.
[413:46.80]See you soon.
[413:48.78]This was very, very last second.
[413:55.40]But I'm glad I did it.
[413:56.11]And yes, I will show an ad.
[414:01.49]Don't worry.
[414:10.15]Stream, is it, has it been 24 hours?
[414:12.03]Yeah, it has, right?
[414:12.77]I did this yesterday, right?
[414:23.27]Uh, for Stream Legends.
[414:24.29]Has it been?
[414:24.63]Yeah, it's been 24 hours.
[414:25.71]I stopped at, like, 8 o'clock yesterday, so.
[414:30.03]Alright, here it comes.
[414:30.83]Stream Legends.
[414:33.89]I sat through a whole stream for this.
[414:37.04]Well, there you go.
[414:37.62]You've been rewarded.
[414:45.59]And for real, go check out those other guys' streams.
[414:54.19]All those guys have supported this stream.
[414:58.28]More than a handful of times, so...
[415:03.65]You know, with raids and hosts and stuff like that.
[415:05.59]So go give them a follow if you don't know who they were.
[415:09.03]Although they're pretty... Pretty fucking popular guys.
[415:16.15]Give them a follow.
[415:22.31]There you go, the subs.
[415:23.90]All of you.
[415:25.40]There are a lot of you now.
[415:28.24]Take care, everybody.
[415:30.94]Get some sleep.
[415:32.04]If you're around tomorrow, we'll be happy to have you.
[415:38.20]What time tomorrow?
[415:39.56]Well, technically today.
[415:41.83]Thursday between 3 and 4 p.m.
[415:43.33]Just the normal time.
[415:46.61]See you tomorrow.
[415:47.53]Take care.
[415:48.47]Have a great one.
[416:03.80]Thank you.
