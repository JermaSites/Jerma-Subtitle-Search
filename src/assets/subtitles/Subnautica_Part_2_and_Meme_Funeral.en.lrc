[01:11.45]Hi there.
[01:11.85]Hey, everybody.
[01:14.99]Hey, it's almost 10 o'clock.
[01:17.05]Just at our perfect stream starting time.
[01:19.47]That's when we typically start a stream is at 10 p.m.
[01:22.40]Eastern time.
[01:23.72]Don't let anybody tell you differently.
[01:25.76]That's just how it is in 2018.
[01:28.64]Hey, guys.
[01:31.94]Yes.
[01:34.03]Today is the day.
[01:36.37]February 1st, 2018.
[01:41.18]Jesco.
[01:43.30]I've been trying.
[01:46.34]I hope everyone's having a good weekend.
[01:48.50]That just hasn't even started yet.
[01:50.48]It's starting tomorrow because I thought today was Friday because my brain is a scrambled fucking egg.
[01:58.34]It's February 2nd.
[01:59.23]Well, it's not February 2nd yet.
[02:01.89]It's February 1st.
[02:02.99]Have a good weekend, everybody.
[02:10.90]I lose track of time so easily.
[02:13.46]It's kind of insane.
[02:17.70]Perfect start to my almost weekend.
[02:20.90]Who remembers Doug Funney?
[02:21.66]Remember when Doug Funney made an extra day to the week?
[02:26.49]He added an extra weekend day, fun day.
[02:29.77]It was Friday, Saturday, Sunday, fun day, Monday.
[02:34.63]Why can't we just add an eighth day to the week and have it be fun day?
[02:38.27]Like Doug Funney.
[02:42.03]Anyways, today, you know what's going to happen today.
[02:45.11]I've been talking about it for the last three weeks.
[02:48.71]This is where we bury the memes.
[02:51.94]But not yet.
[02:53.62]Because we're going to play Subnautica for a little while.
[02:56.30]At least until I see people trickle in.
[03:02.52]Put down the booze.
[03:04.17]No!
[03:06.29]Hold on a second.
[03:06.81]Streamlabs is not showing.

[03:25.88]No, this is very late.
[03:27.76]But, it's, uh, hopefully it'll be worth it.

[04:21.08]They're all getting buried.
[04:23.14]They're all gone tonight.
[04:25.42]I'm going to get up.
[04:26.14]I'm going to say a couple nice things.
[04:28.62]And they're all gone.
[04:31.02]It's going to be very respectful.

[04:55.57]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[04:57.11]Can you at least give us an explanation why you're so late?
[04:59.41]Here's the... Here you go.
[05:02.55]Uh, I needed to get the meme funeral ready.
[05:06.99]And I slept in.
[05:08.87]Here's your explanation.
[05:11.33]So, we're gonna just take a few minutes to play Subnautica while we wait for people to come in here because I don't want anyone to miss it because people will be very upset at me.
[05:21.26]Jeremy, you waited till 10 p.m.
[05:22.86]and, uh, what the fuck, dude?
[05:24.66]I wasn't there for when the meme stream happened, the meme funeral.
[05:28.08]My favorite meme was not buried on my accordance.
[05:31.83]So, we're gonna wait a little bit.
[05:33.43]Maybe like five, ten minutes.
[05:36.57]Just about.
[05:36.97]Uh, I'll show you where it's gonna be, though.
[05:42.30]Go like this real quick.
[05:44.75]Whoa!
[05:46.99]Hey, guys.
[05:48.29]This is not, like, delayed, right?
[05:49.97]You can hear me?
[05:51.53]Usually it's delayed.
[05:53.01]It's going to be right here, right behind me.
[05:55.47]There's a table here.
[05:56.93]My heater's right here.
[05:57.73]So don't worry.
[06:00.63]You'll see it very, very shortly.
[06:03.05]Just give me, like, a few minutes to get, like, settled and let people come in.
[06:12.06]Long hair.
[06:12.86]My hair is long.
[06:13.78]And it's ugly.
[06:15.70]I'm so ugly.
[06:17.00]Alright, let's play Subnautica for a few.
[06:20.24]We're gonna leave off right... We're gonna start right where we left off.
[06:24.82]And we left off with... I was gonna build a base.
[06:30.21]Hopefully this is not too loud.
[06:34.17]I forgot where the base was already, so we're gonna have to go... Uh...
[06:40.09]At least initially, we're going to have to try and pick up some titanium.
[06:46.00]There's my ship.
[06:46.70]If you remember from last time, it's too loud.
[06:49.12]I will very, very quickly rectify that situation.
[06:53.02]That should be better.
[06:55.54]Thank you for reporting that bug and feedback to me.
[07:00.00]Okay, let's... Enter the sea moth.
[07:04.88]No, I want to pick up some... We need to get some titanium.
[07:09.39]Now it's too quiet.
[07:11.09]Well, you're going to have to fucking deal with it.
[07:14.65]Why am I lagging so bad?
[07:15.57]Am I missing something here?
[07:17.97]Table coral.
[07:18.47]Give me some of that.
[07:19.41]Okay.
[07:21.41]I'll pick up the giant mushroom.
[07:24.31]Titanium.
[07:25.17]What's in my inventory right now?
[07:28.45]This is trash.
[07:31.29]I'll keep one of these.
[07:32.22]I want metal and titanium.
[07:37.62]Call me Stud Muffin.
[07:38.48]Hey, thanks a lot.
[07:39.12]I appreciate that.
[07:41.12]It's silent?
[07:43.22]It is not silent.
[07:44.32]I'm very, very certain of that.
[07:49.38]Metal.
[07:50.52]Why is it running like shit?
[07:52.98]It wasn't doing this last night.
[07:54.66]Weird.
[07:57.40]Here we go.
[07:59.88]Pick up the metal salvage.
[08:02.74]Lifepod 19.
[08:03.78]Didn't I already do that?
[08:05.18]I'm trying to remember what I actually did yesterday.
[08:08.86]It's fine.
[08:09.36]Don't listen to them.
[08:10.00]Well, I wonder why I'm losing frames for some reason.
[08:15.70]For some dumb reason.
[08:22.07]It runs like shit because you play like shit.
[08:25.05]Hey, come on now.
[08:26.69]Give me a break.
[08:27.89]This is the goddamn meme funeral.
[08:29.25]Have some respect.
[08:30.11]Let me get some air.
[08:33.79]It's a slideshow.
[08:34.89]Is it really?
[08:37.97]Is it a slideshow?
[08:42.71]It shouldn't be a slideshow, but it might be.
[08:45.36]I don't know why.
[08:46.14]Let me... I think I have enough.
[08:52.28]Do I have enough?
[08:55.68]No, I need to turn this into titanium.
[08:57.69]I have a bunch of titanium sitting in a chest.
[08:59.51]Let's pull it out.
[09:04.07]It's not in this one.
[09:04.95]It's in this one, I think, right?
[09:08.46]Yes.
[09:11.11]Okay.
[09:11.37]Uh, no.
[09:12.93]I want to build a base.
[09:13.67]I don't want to fuck around.
[09:15.13]I need two lead.
[09:17.91]It's a nice PowerPoint presentation.
[09:21.61]Maybe we'll get another frame in two hours.
[09:25.91]Uh, lead.
[09:26.67]Do I have any lead?
[09:29.39]I do.
[09:30.55]Alright, let's build the foundation.
[09:33.41]Maybe- I don't want to build it right next to the base, because that would be stupid.
[09:39.83]Pre-recorded game footage.
[09:41.15]It's not pre-recorded.
[09:42.23]I'm here right now.
[09:43.83]You can see me.
[09:45.33]Literally right here.
[09:48.11]Being a dickhead on camera.
[09:51.13]I want to put it over here.
[09:54.59]This is going to be a build-a-bay stream, as you are well aware.
[09:56.93]Like right here.
[10:01.63]No, maybe a little bit further down.
[10:05.73]No one said that yes, they did.
[10:07.81]I just looked over and they said that Foundation now it's gonna be deeper like over here How about here Why can I go I'm gonna go like a little deeper maybe It isn't fake turn on facecam and blink three times oh
[10:36.28]How about right here?
[10:37.34]I feel like this is a good spot.
[10:39.74]Let's construct it.
[10:43.08]I got my lead.
[10:46.13]There it is.
[10:46.57]There's the foundation.
[10:49.83]Now that I have a foundation, let's think about the other pieces.
[10:54.11]So, we can get a hatch, we can get a window, reinforcement, an X component, which I'm not sure why that would exist right here.
[11:03.98]That's a bad spot.
[11:06.60]Why is this a bad spot?
[11:08.18]It's in a perfect spot.
[11:10.72]How do I build a wall?
[11:12.18]Is it reinforcement?
[11:13.18]Increases hull integrity.
[11:16.15]Basic tube... Base in the shallows.
[11:20.19]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[11:24.19]Read this message or you're pre-recorded.
[11:26.13]I'm reading your fucking messages.
[11:27.87]I need a tube.
[11:31.68]Let's go with a... Okay, here we go.
[11:37.22]Basic tubular compartment.
[11:38.66]So should I just do this here?
[11:39.98]I'm trying to understand what a wall is.
[11:47.57]Meme funeral on the foundation.
[11:53.59]Let's just go right here.
[11:55.21]How about right there?
[11:59.00]And then we can put... I don't think that's right.
[12:02.22]I have no idea if that's right.
[12:08.81]It's a modular base, not like Minecraft.
[12:11.21]Oh, okay.
[12:13.31]So eventually do I get to have a spot here?
[12:18.42]That sounds like something a pre-recorded streamer would say.
[12:24.06]What is with you guys?
[12:25.92]I need to get a hatch.
[12:26.94]Look, I can deconstruct it.
[12:28.38]Just remember that.
[12:29.08]What are the coordinates?
[12:31.34]Here are the coordinates.
[12:33.53]Whatever they are, right?
[12:35.15]A, B, C, X, Y. Those are my coordinates.
[12:37.27]This is what I have here.
[12:40.78]Just use the tubes.
[12:41.72]That's fine.
[12:43.14]Let's go get some more titanium.
[12:44.61]Everybody calm down.
[12:48.71]You need the hatches and the cylinders.
[12:50.71]Okay.
[12:51.01]Well, the foundation can just stay there for now.
[12:55.14]I need to find the blueprint for the multi-purpose room.
[12:56.90]Alright, so I can't even do that shit then.
[13:03.96]If we get it, start the real stream.
[13:07.10]This is the real stream.
[13:08.32]I just have to back up and move my table and do a meme eulogy.
[13:12.70]Oh, you think it's gonna be some extravagant thing?
[13:16.28]Wait, don't lose place the way that is.
[13:17.88]I know I'm a fucking idiot and I will forget what that is.
[13:25.77]Give me like at least 10 minutes.
[13:26.89]Okay, right here.
[13:29.41]So where is that in regards to the actual ship?
[13:31.91]Okay, it's like a hundred meters.
[13:35.77]Over here, over this way.
[13:37.08]So let me get in the sea moth.
[13:38.00]Let's go collect some stuff.
[13:42.70]Build a beacon.
[13:43.38]That's actually a really good idea.
[13:46.06]Watch out here.
[13:47.60]So I need to go back, pull up this thing.
[13:49.52]Get out of the way, you fucking asshole.
[13:53.19]Let's put a beacon here.
[13:54.45]Do I have the resources to build a beacon?
[13:58.65]Is this a terrible place for the base?
[14:00.09]It probably is.
[14:02.49]I have like these fucking dumb poison manatees right here.
[14:06.34]My beacon manager.
[14:09.46]How do I set my own beacon?
[14:12.26]Do I have to build one?
[14:15.32]Where is beacon?
[14:22.81]I don't see beacon!
[14:29.97]Squibble chair.
[14:32.73]Have I seen Sea Satan?
[14:34.35]I don't think so.
[14:34.95]Not yet.
[14:40.41]Well, what about time?
[14:41.03]Maybe we'll do the meme stream now.
[14:44.87]What do we got for time?
[14:45.97]Let me just see.
[14:46.41]I'm going to pause it for a second.
[14:51.63]Cans of bees.
[14:52.91]Should we have enough people trickled in?
[14:56.21]Should we say our goodbyes to these memes?
[15:01.86]Hair.
[15:03.48]Look, I'm bumping the mic and shit, but let me fix my hair.
[15:07.28]There.
[15:08.13]Perfect.
[15:10.79]Alright, give me a second.
[15:12.85]We'll do this now.
[15:13.77]I wanted to... I made a tweet, right?
[15:16.37]Give me a minute.
[15:17.91]I have to move some shit around.
[15:18.97]There we are.
[15:25.62]Why is that not... Okay.
[15:27.76]Alright, give me two seconds.
[15:29.06]Let me just get this started.
[15:31.72]Give me a minute.
[15:36.70]I'll be right back.
[15:37.34]I just want to move some shit around.
[15:41.42]Fucking goddamn meme stream.
[15:47.36]This is what you came for.
[15:52.26]Give me a second.
[15:59.77]Give me the table.
[16:02.94]One sec.
[16:27.57]There we are.
[16:29.05]Okay, hey.
[16:31.02]So, if you have no idea what's going on, I'm gonna just very, very basically go over what the hell you're seeing here.
[16:37.22]In this box are all the memes.
[16:39.90]Every joke that we've ever made in 2017, including the Rumble participants, they're all in here.
[16:46.97]Think of it like, um... You know in Harry Potter, when they pull the ectoplasms out of the head?
[16:52.97]That would be shucks.
[16:54.15]Like Dumbledore drinks it and he turns into a fucking monster.
[16:56.49]That doesn't even happen.
[16:59.78]Speaking of monster, am I getting like fat?
[17:04.65]I look like a fucking Attack on Titan monster.
[17:06.55]Alright, anyways.
[17:07.73]So you know that whole thing, you can store memories.
[17:11.07]Think of this box as all of our memories from 2017, all the funny jokes that you made, especially like the counting shit, you know, that's in here.
[17:20.30]All the people that lost the rumble, they're all in here.
[17:22.44]And a lot of them are still alive, as you can very plainly hear.
[17:29.42]So we're gonna do something here.
[17:31.36]We're gonna give them their journey out.
[17:34.52]We're gonna give them the respect that they deserve.
[17:36.20]We're gonna give a eulogy, and I'm gonna be the one to give the eulogy.
[17:40.18]and we're gonna treat him with respect.
[17:42.93]The trash can.
[17:45.15]So, let's go ahead and get started here.
[17:46.70]I don't wanna waste that much more time.
[17:47.96]This is only gonna be about five minutes.
[17:49.72]We're not gonna take all stream doing this.
[17:52.50]So let's open... I don't want any getting out!
[17:54.80]If any fucking memes get out, I'm gonna have a huge problem.
[17:57.50]Because if they get to get out of here and they live, you get to make that joke in 2018.
[18:00.80]Uh-uh.
[18:02.40]I don't want that to be a possibility.
[18:03.68]So let's be very careful here.
[18:06.32]And get this open.
[18:07.80]This is my meme box.
[18:09.02]I've been very, very, very nice to them.
[18:11.88]I've been very good to them.
[18:14.06]You're gonna get me out of here.
[18:17.18]I promise you.
[18:19.12]So, like I told you, there's a few that are still alive.
[18:22.09]And by a few, I mean there's probably like two or three hundred that are still alive.
[18:26.13]And it's, um, it's like, it gets really annoying, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep.
[18:33.24]You can possibly imagine the fact that these things just don't ever fucking stop.
[18:37.84]And they just say their same joke.
[18:39.82]They say the joke that they are over and over again.
[18:41.98]And it gets really, really fucking irritating.
[18:44.69]Oh!
[18:47.90]So let's say a few words and send them along.
[18:50.54]We're going to do this as fast as possible.
[18:53.23]So... A very, very special goodbye to... Here we have some coffee.
[19:04.37]Yeah, see you later.
[19:06.94]Got some chicken.
[19:10.00]And we've got...
[19:11.53]You did it in the wrong order.
[19:12.45]You didn't even do it in the right order.
[19:13.91]Shut the fuck up.
[19:15.01]Cheetos.
[19:15.41]Here.
[19:15.84]You don't even know your own joke.
[19:17.50]You're a stupid punk.
[19:18.34]You can't even do it in the right order.
[19:21.98]Chicken.
[19:22.38]Goodbye.
[19:22.60]It'll be okay.
[19:23.18]Look, but let's think.
[19:23.94]Look.
[19:26.32]Once they go into the dumpster, and once the fucking dumpster crushes them, I don't have to worry about it anymore.
[19:31.55]They're dead regardless.
[19:32.73]They've been dead.
[19:33.29]It's not a big deal.
[19:35.87]Uh, okay, next we have... We have a couple of things here.
[19:39.63]We have, what's this?
[19:40.71]It's a guitar?
[19:41.43]Did they make a guitar joke in 2017?
[19:42.94]Did somebody make, like, a musical joke?
[19:44.76]Let's give it a try.
[20:04.70]Alright, you didn't know I was that talented.
[20:07.88]Maybe that's where I came from.
[20:08.74]Maybe someone made a joke about how talented I was.
[20:10.98]And like, oh, show your guitar skills on stream.
[20:13.92]That's a 2018 joke.
[20:14.32]That was 2017.
[20:17.77]Anyway, so let's keep going.
[20:18.99]We have... This is obviously double zero, right?
[20:23.73]Because of the gambling.
[20:41.18]Okay, that's nine.
[20:45.62]Shut up.
[20:46.06]Who bit me?
[20:49.40]Ah, okay, I see who bit me.
[20:50.85]Yeah, get up here, you little asshole.
[20:56.27]That's Tiny Jerma.
[20:58.19]Yes, it's me, Tiny Jerma.
[21:00.11]But before you get rid of me, you need to understand something.
[21:02.90]Please listen.
[21:04.63]We are you.
[21:06.99]We are just your psyche.
[21:09.01]You've made these jokes.
[21:10.53]Chat loves these jokes.
[21:12.35]Just because you don't happen to agree with them all the time doesn't mean you have to get rid of us.
[21:16.41]We're funny.
[21:17.63]Don't you understand?
[21:18.47]We are you.
[21:20.75]These are you.
[21:21.79]You know what?
[21:27.37]Some of the things you're saying are very, very true.
[21:29.95]They are.
[21:30.41]But in the same realm...
[21:39.94]Alright, yeah.
[21:40.98]Yeah, he's a funny guy.
[21:42.58]We got a funny guy here.
[21:46.11]Get out of the fucking way.

[21:56.45]Star Wars?
[21:57.87]Star Wars collectible trading cards.
[21:59.67]I just need to open these.
[22:03.27]How the fuck did these... This is not even a meme.
[22:05.14]Yeah, it is.
[22:06.10]We've talked about Star Wars like a hundred times.
[22:08.52]Let's see what we got here.
[22:10.86]Rebel Assault is released in 1993.
[22:15.24]Who cares?
[22:17.23]Where's my rare card?
[22:19.61]The Stormtrooper.
[22:23.43]Luke fucking jumping around like a moron.
[22:26.49]There's the gear.
[22:27.97]This is in a different language, so I don't know what that means.
[22:30.64]Whatever, fuck it.
[22:37.05]Yeah, oh, oh, who's the funny guy, huh?
[22:43.02]Of course, it's a bunch of jokes in here.
[22:44.78]What is this?
[22:45.72]These are Chuck E. Cheese redemption tickets.
[22:48.16]Get him here.
[22:48.79]Get him off.

[23:11.63]I got out.
[23:12.45]I got out.
[23:12.97]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[23:14.63]Don't think so.
[23:16.01]Don't think so.
[23:16.89]Where's the exit?
[23:17.85]I see a window over there.
[23:19.27]He thinks he's going to get away.
[23:21.54]I don't know.
[23:22.14]Where should I go?
[23:23.48]I'm not getting away from you.
[23:27.40]I ain't letting any of these come to 2018.
[23:30.00]I guarantee that.
[23:31.96]What is this?
[23:32.38]I don't know what these are.
[23:33.28]It's more Star Wars shit.
[23:44.35]That joke didn't even work!
[24:09.50]Say a few words.
[24:11.18]It's a Sephora bag.
[24:12.52]It is with the utmost respect that we say goodbye to these in 2017 memes here and jokes.
[24:21.57]Let's go ahead and say our goodbyes.
[24:24.51]It was nice.
[24:25.03]Thank you for joining us in this 2017, guys.
[24:29.36]But, you know, it's time to say goodbye.
[24:32.24]We had a lot of fun.
[24:33.72]They were very funny when they first came out.
[24:36.02]But when you hear the same thing a hundred fucking times, it gets annoying.
[24:40.38]So, you know what?
[24:40.90]We're just going to have a little bit of fun here with these memes.
[24:59.82]Okay.
[25:02.40]So this can go in the trash.
[25:10.12]I don't want any that is still alive.
[25:16.04]No, we're good.
[25:16.42]I think they're all dead.
[25:18.20]Good.
[25:20.08]So let's just go back to play Subnautica in about two minutes.
[25:32.56]So to wrap that up, I do want to say every year a meme come and goes, as long as you treat it with respect that it deserves, then we can continue to make other jokes and other things that are funny.
[25:49.61]So let's go pick up fucking rocks in Subnautica.
[25:56.45]I'll see you in a second.
[26:19.94]Chair is kind of in the way.
[26:22.66]It's OK.
[26:25.46]Put that there.
[26:28.52]Hey, let's get that.
[26:31.17]Let me just move the table.
[26:38.49]Table is kind of in the way.
[26:52.60]Oh, my back kind of hurts.
[26:58.98]There you are.
[27:02.80]I like threw my back out.
[27:05.00]Grabbing trash bags full of stupid fucking memes.
[27:12.53]You just witnessed a murder.
[27:14.09]Yeah, well, that's too bad.
[27:19.37]Sometimes they have to die.
[27:23.50]Yeah, and if you understand that Next and jermaEarth weren't in that bag because they are currently in the digital realm.
[27:30.98]Don't you understand?
[27:32.16]They're in the digital realm.
[27:33.34]I have to remove them tonight.
[27:38.41]Meme funeral, more like meme genocide.
[27:41.33]We buried them and they're gone.
[27:53.39]Now there's the meme funeral.
[27:57.21]Now let's play Subnautica for a little while.
[28:02.60]Baked Flakes just gave 50 bucks.
[28:06.74]All hail Big Wow, the new meme king.
[28:11.52]That was brutal with unnecessary force.
[28:15.44]Was it though?
[28:16.60]Was it actually unnecessary?
[28:19.14]Or was it very necessary?
[28:22.98]But thank you, bake place.
[28:23.86]50 bucks, that's a ton of money.
[28:26.49]That's 50 fucking dollars.
[28:28.89]Yeah, big wow.
[28:30.51]The rest are dead.
[28:33.35]I made sure of that five seconds ago.
[28:37.16]I made very sure of that.
[28:41.40]Those memes had families.
[28:47.70]They're fucking dead.
[28:49.19]Who cares?
[28:51.60]What were we doing?
[28:52.78]Oh, I gotta seek fluid intake.
[28:58.29]Now, hey, now let's play Subnautica for like two hours.
[29:03.59]Now, I need a drink after that.
[29:06.69]My, like, body is a little, I'm a little dehydrated.
[29:10.95]Give me like, give me like two seconds.
[29:12.17]I need to get like a, well, yeah, here we go.
[29:14.72]I need to get like a fucking drink.

[30:25.68]Where's the joke?
[30:26.76]Oh, here comes the joke.
[30:29.00]No, there is no joke.
[30:31.68]Guys, there's no joke.
[30:35.50]I'm just here.
[30:35.98]They're fucking dead.
[30:43.22]There is no joke.
[30:45.08]They're in here, and they're decomposing as we speak.
[30:48.56]So this stream's only going to be like fucking 45 minutes long, because I don't want dead decomposing memes in my fucking basement.
[30:55.81]Kayanara!
[30:58.87]That was a little underwhelming, but we're looking for a joke.
[31:02.69]What, a meme's going to come out and like fly away?
[31:05.26]That's not going to fucking happen.
[31:08.34]They're dead in there, and they're decomposing.
[31:10.38]That's just the way it is.
[31:20.56]That's a shit brand garbage bag.
[31:22.18]What are you talking about?
[31:27.90]Does it just, does it like, does a general shit garbage, yeah, I guess they are shit brand.

[32:36.61]Alright.
[32:41.05]What was I doing?
[32:42.57]I need water.
[32:43.21]I need to actually drink.
[32:46.88]Get the fuck away from me.
[32:51.82]Not funny.
[32:53.55]What's not funny?
[32:55.33]The fact that I killed all the memes?
[33:00.12]I can't believe you snapped tiny Jerma's neck.
[33:03.82]Yeah, I did.
[33:05.82]Is there a problem?
[33:07.42]Do we actually have a problem with that?
[33:11.10]What am I building?
[33:16.40]Rotten.
[33:18.98]Don't drop the first aid.
[33:22.27]Okay, let me actually get situated.

[33:32.42]Let's put another battery in.
[33:35.90]That'll do.
[33:38.76]Let's get in the seam off and let's go on an adventure.
[33:41.32]A meme might have escaped.
[33:45.86]I mean, if they did, then that's fine.
[33:48.57]Whatever.
[33:50.23]I tried to contain them as best I could.
[33:56.46]It was just depressing.
[34:00.42]Why?
[34:04.84]Don't you know that memes have infinite lives?
[34:09.37]There's no stopping any meme.
[34:10.81]You can't stop a meme.

[42:08.14]Alright, let's check the radio.
[42:12.99]This is light pod four.
[42:14.03]Light pod four.
[42:14.77]We've landed close to the Aurora.
[42:16.77]Flotation device is active, but we've got some big old fish in the water.
[42:20.01]Big old fish.
[42:20.53]We don't know how long we're going to last.
[42:22.32]We're close to the crash site, so bring radiation protection.
[42:25.42]Four out.
[42:26.06]I already got it on, number four.
[42:29.30]Approximate transmission origin recorded to date.
[42:33.31]Okay, so is that listed here or no?
[42:37.43]Lifepod 4 is not on here.
[42:39.01]We have to go to the data bank.
[42:42.12]This is obviously right next to the ship.
[42:44.62]A distress signal has been received from Lifepod 4, but the attached coordinates were corrupted.
[42:49.54]Last available photogenic data has been downloaded and analyzed.
[42:53.78]Flotation device Lifepod located at sea level.
[42:58.32]Pod is in close proximity to a radioactive fallout from the Aurora.
[43:02.17]Transmission origin approximately 150 miles northwest of the Aurora's port midsection.
[43:08.43]Let's go find this thing.
[43:12.81]You stupid fucking memes are dead, alright?
[43:15.57]I'm the only one that's still around.
[43:17.37]I'm the only one that survived.
[43:19.20]I'm the one that gets to persevere.
[43:22.38]Your memes are no longer here.
[43:24.48]You can't hide behind them anymore.
[43:25.90]They're dead.
[43:26.64]They're gone.
[43:27.80]Sorry.
[43:28.54]You have to deal with it.
[43:31.33]And if that means I want to take all the respect from the memes that you gave to those respectful memes that I just slaughtered in front of you.
[43:42.26]There is no joke incoming.
[43:43.50]You want to see a joke?
[43:50.75]I got nothing.
[43:51.35]There's no joke.
[43:52.23]Don't worry.

[44:02.12]Is it, um... 150 northwest of the port.
[44:04.76]Midsection.

[45:47.90]Should I focus on that?
[45:49.62]I don't understand.
[45:55.55]Is that something I should be doing?
[45:56.69]I should be focusing on that?
[45:57.87]Uh, compass.
[46:00.70]Where did it go?
[46:01.16]Okay, I just have it on.
[46:05.68]Displays compass heading on the HUD.
[46:08.60]Okay, I have this food.
[46:09.92]I'm just gonna eat it now.
[46:11.00]Because I need to.
[46:12.49]Alright, let's go take a look and see if we can find this distress signal.
[46:18.39]It was...
[46:21.42]150 meters northwest of the Aurora's port midsection.
[46:28.15]Okie dokie.
[46:31.37]Where is my ship?
[46:34.25]It just, like, crashed over here.
[46:38.08]Let's go find it.
[46:39.08]It's right here.
[46:39.72]Let's see what's over there.
[46:51.02]Mods are out spear fishing.
[46:54.02]I told you, you're gonna get like at least a 30 second ban if you start doing memes after today.
[47:00.52]It's 1030 at night, we've got like another 25 minutes.
[47:04.75]Until it's an hour from then, you can't use those memes anymore.
[47:12.23]Alright, what do we got?
[47:12.73]Let's see.
[47:15.89]Jerma has become a normal, regular, old fart streamer.
[47:18.93]How dare you?
[47:20.69]Did you see what I just did?
[47:21.63]I just put a bunch of memes in a bag and hit them against a wall.
[47:28.44]That's normal to you?
[47:29.52]That's excruciatingly abnormal.
[47:34.00]Alright, is port left or right side?
[47:35.66]I don't know.
[47:37.52]I haven't been in the sea in a while.
[47:44.13]This is 150 meters northwest.
[47:46.61]Where's my fucking... There it is.
[47:52.14]Let's see if we can find it.
[47:55.32]Boring burp streamer.
[47:58.07]I'm not a... Am I on the right side?
[47:59.81]What is starboard?
[48:01.65]Is starboard right or left?
[48:03.11]Tell me.
[48:03.71]Somebody, please.
[48:04.31]Because this is northwest, right here.
[48:11.79]I will find it.
[48:16.61]It's the right side.
[48:17.49]Okay, so I'm on the wrong side.
[48:22.76]Let me look at the picture.
[48:23.58]Okay, so we got the weird... So it looks like this.
[48:26.52]So it should be like right here.
[48:30.53]There it is.
[48:33.93]Get the fuck out of here!
[48:36.87]Found it.
[48:41.73]What do we got?
[48:45.92]Distress signal?
[48:46.62]Nothing?
[48:47.90]Can I get in?
[48:51.76]What's going on here?
[48:53.36]Can I not get in this?
[48:58.58]Okay.
[49:00.56]What the hell is over here?
[49:05.74]Nothing.
[49:07.20]This is a waste of time.
[49:09.64]This is just a total waste of time, apparently.
[49:12.30]Because I can't even get in here.
[49:16.84]Open data box.
[49:17.98]I mean, I can't even...
[49:26.01]there we go it's not a big deal creature decoy first aid there's a giant hole in the side I got it I can see it come on okay well there's a new decoy device I can make now cool so is where's the let me look at this again transport six
[49:56.33]Alright, hold on.
[49:57.05]Everybody, everybody, shut up.
[50:00.41]Transmission origin approximately 400 meters west-northwest of Lifepod 4's last known location.
[50:09.42]North... Okay, so west-northwest.
[50:15.58]So we got west-northwest, so right here.
[50:22.20]I guess we're gonna go this way.
[50:24.35]See if we can find it.
[50:27.72]I missed something.
[50:28.66]Would you guys just shut up?
[50:38.96]North left.
[50:39.66]What did I miss?
[50:41.38]PDA.
[50:43.14]Thank you.
[50:43.78]What would I do without you guys?
[50:52.51]Alright.
[50:52.81]Now we need to go west, northwest.
[50:57.92]Which is right here.
[50:59.40]West is exactly where I need to go.
[51:02.94]Right here.
[51:04.58]That is where the other life pod is.
[51:06.98]Apparently.
[51:07.48]400 meters.
[51:12.50]Don't ask me.
[51:13.10]There are some new life forms here we have not scanned.
[51:17.89]Let's scan.
[51:21.23]Come here, you.
[51:23.61]My computer, like, can't handle this.
[51:26.19]Get over here.
[51:26.87]Ah, you fucking idiot.
[51:28.31]Tree spawn.
[51:29.87]What's this?
[51:32.49]Salt?
[51:33.43]Salt deposit.
[51:35.37]Why is my game running like shit?
[51:37.10]I don't understand.
[51:38.38]I played this yesterday.
[51:41.58]Like, yesterday I played this.
[51:44.46]And I'm having trouble right now streaming the game.
[51:45.84]Okay, I guess I can't pull that off.
[51:55.39]Alright, still north, west-north?
[51:56.93]Okay, west-northwest, so we're going the right way.
[52:04.02]It's right here somewhere.
[52:12.26]I think we're gonna be there very shortly.
[52:13.81]This looks like the place, right here somewhere.
[52:21.65]Right?
[52:21.89]This looks like the picture on the postcard, right?
[52:28.30]The hell is it?
[52:29.98]There it is!
[52:30.36]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[52:33.64]There are these weirdos.
[52:38.56]Lifepod 6.
[52:42.79]God, right when I get out of the fucking tube, you're gonna come over here?
[52:45.67]Please.
[52:49.57]Data box.
[52:51.41]Let's grab the Ultra Glide Fins.
[52:53.51]That's cool.
[52:56.32]And a new PDA.
[52:57.98]Can I get in here?
[53:02.41]Ultra fins.
[53:05.67]Right in the top, another PDA.
[53:08.17]Lipod 6 crew log.
[53:10.43]And some lead.
[53:13.09]Well, your death wasn't invade.
[53:14.28]I got some lead.
[53:18.10]Advanced theories?
[53:19.04]Shit, there's a monster here.
[53:26.59]Ultraglide.
[53:27.05]Let's go back and take a look.
[53:28.53]Okay, I got some new things to make.
[53:31.19]Let's go ahead and make them.
[53:39.53]Scan the stuff inside the ship.
[53:40.59]That's not a bad idea.
[53:45.02]That ain't a bad idea at all.
[53:48.92]Oh, we got some flares.
[53:54.12]I don't think there's anything in here.
[53:56.72]I thought I could see.
[54:00.92]Why is jermaEarth still here?
[54:02.02]Because you have until tomorrow.
[54:04.12]And then it's going on vacation.
[54:07.86]I don't think I can do anything here.
[54:09.20]Let me see the Ultra Glide Fins.
[54:16.38]Titanium and Lithium.
[54:23.14]Where are the Ultra Glide Fins?
[54:25.39]Creature Decoy.
[54:29.09]Ultraglide fins.
[54:32.55]Titanium.
[54:33.39]What the hell do you get lithium?
[54:40.05]Lithium.
[54:44.98]Huh.
[54:45.20]Lithium is the shit that gets buried in a random sinkhole in the middle of nowhere because you can't get rid of them.
[54:51.82]You can't throw it away.
[54:52.90]It's the battery that's inside your laptop that will never be destroyed.
[55:03.83]from batteries this is true let's go back I gotta go to an abandoned island let's go this way let's go this way I ignore the wreck I've already been to that wreck
[55:35.05]I already scraped.
[55:35.97]I already did like the butter scrape with the knife.
[55:38.77]There's nothing there.
[55:42.07]Look, we're going to have to go back later.
[55:48.56]Except for over here.
[55:49.56]What's this?
[55:50.90]There's some big shit over here.
[55:56.66]Sig shot him down the hole.
[56:00.52]OWO wasn't in the trash bag?
[56:02.02]How do you know that?
[56:04.20]you know what was in that trash bag should I open it and show you what's in there they're all in there I think I just hit myself with my own ship okay creature decoy I don't really I don't really care about that do I
[56:33.97]Ah, there's another ping on the radio.
[56:35.69]Let's see what it is.
[56:38.05]What the hell is this?
[56:38.93]39 minutes.
[56:39.21]39 minutes?
[56:39.97]Where?
[56:40.17]Where am I supposed to go?
[57:03.75]Did I just beat the game?
[57:04.57]Um... Sunbeam will arrive in 39 minutes.
[57:15.08]Do I have a location where that's going to happen?
[57:16.92]Or is it just... Oh.
[57:23.68]Sunbeam landing site.
[57:24.92]I gotta get over there.
[57:25.82]I need food, right?
[57:26.74]Do I have any food?
[57:29.44]That was a health potion.
[57:33.17]Okay, I gotta just get over there.
[57:36.97]Watch this be the end of the game.
[57:38.12]Alright, do I have enough power in this?
[57:45.94]I do.
[57:47.32]Alright, let's just get over there.
[57:52.09]It's pretty far away, so it's gonna take me like 35 minutes to get there.
[57:56.83]Oh, fuck me.
[57:57.77]I need food.
[57:58.63]I'm gonna eat.
[58:01.41]I'm gonna chill and eat over there.
[58:03.79]I'm just gonna eat popcorn and drink water until they show up.
[58:10.80]Come here.
[58:17.54]What a terrible diet, by the way.
[58:19.08]Yeah, I'm just gonna eat popcorn and drink water.
[58:22.84]I will barely be alive by the time you get there.
[58:35.98]Mmm, I missed him.
[58:36.90]Ugh.
[58:38.16]Get over here.
[58:39.60]Get over here!
[58:40.82]Ah!
[58:42.20]Forget it.
[58:44.18]Fuck, come here!
[58:45.26]Come here, you Mr. Popper's penguins.
[58:51.50]Alright, let's go.
[58:55.54]Water's a horrible drink?
[58:56.59]I'm not saying water's a bad drink, I'm just saying... Like, really?
[59:00.57]You're gonna eat popcorn and drink water?
[59:05.73]Where's the stamina?
[59:08.69]Where's the protein?
[59:09.97]You don't get protein from popcorn.
[59:11.39]Let's craft some food.
[59:20.00]I can curate some... Cured boomerang.
[59:24.76]I can make this last a little bit.
[59:29.75]Cooked Mr. Popper's penguin.
[59:32.59]I have a chest full of water already.
[59:35.47]You can never have too much water, though.
[59:36.91]It's the greatest drink.
[59:38.77]It does help a lot.
[59:48.01]You know, you should drink more water.
[59:49.45]You really should.
[59:52.06]What is it?
[59:52.62]Like 18, 16 ounce glasses of water a day?
[59:55.80]What's the recommended daily intake of water?
[59:59.82]It's something like that.
[60:04.16]It's like a hundred gallons of water a week.
[60:07.44]Then you piss it out.
[60:08.40]What is it?
[60:09.60]Eight ounces of glasses of water.
[60:15.78]You know what I'm saying.
[60:16.73]You understand.
[60:18.45]Alright.
[60:18.81]I got full health.
[60:20.33]I'm ready to go check out the beacon.
[60:22.09]I'm going to be there like 30 minutes early.
[60:27.03]It's going to CMOS.
[60:31.94]I just went right by it.
[60:37.95]Alright, let's get over there.
[60:39.72]We'll collect a couple of samples 35 minutes until the stream is over Blind why am I blind?
[60:52.69]Am I stoned?
[60:54.97]What are you?
[60:55.35]What am I stoned?
[60:56.13]What are you talking about?
[60:59.05]Why do you think I'm stoned?
[61:02.33]You think humans drink a hundred gallons of water?
[61:05.31]Yes, I do.
[61:06.74]Okay.
[61:08.12]Alright.
[61:08.42]Let's do a little bit of a calculation here on stream.
[61:11.98]How many ounces in a gallon?
[61:16.02]Okay.
[61:17.74]There are 128 ounces in a gallon.
[61:20.29]So you need eight
[61:26.45]eight ounces glasses of water.
[61:28.24]So you need eight, you need eight, eight ounce glasses of water a day.
[61:33.00]So what is, let's do a little bit of a calculation.
[61:35.58]Let's see how much water you take in a year.
[61:38.52]So eight, eight ounce glasses is 128 ounces, 128 ounces for one gallon.
[61:41.22]So eight, eight ounce glasses, so that's eight times eight, that's 64 ounces a day.
[61:44.26]So 64 plus 64,
[61:56.21]That's one, you're supposed to drink a gallon of water over two days, according to the CDC, the Center for Disease Control.
[62:06.47]So if we take that into consideration in two days, so 365 divided by two, that's 182 days.
[62:11.76]So you're supposed to drink one gallon of water
[62:21.58]That's 182 gallons of water you are supposed to drink in a year.
[62:27.43]So sorry, me saying 100 gallons a year is true.
[62:37.73]That's 180 gallons a year that you have to drink.
[62:43.24]That's not rocket science, that's just regular science.
[62:52.89]stoner math that's not stoner math that is 182 gallons a year you drink two gallons a day no you drink two gallons every two days what are you guys some kind of fucking dummies I said weak no I didn't I'm sorry that was fucking lame
[63:20.67]I knew this guy dabbed.
[63:22.67]Don't ever say that again.
[63:24.93]I'm so sad that that's a 2018 fucking meme.
[63:28.45]No, it's not.
[63:28.85]That's 2017.
[63:29.21]That was when Etalyx was here.
[63:32.05]I gotta burn that one.
[63:34.11]Sorry.
[63:34.39]I'm gonna dab and light myself on fire while I dab.
[63:42.03]182 gallons of water a year.
[63:45.14]Just don't do it all in one sitting.
[63:47.16]You'll die.
[63:51.82]He's drunk from water.
[63:55.30]Holy shit, this really is like a... Okay, well, I didn't know this was gonna be actually... I can't move now.
[64:01.56]Oh, god damn it.
[64:03.42]Can I push this?
[64:08.15]I didn't know I was gonna beach myself.
[64:12.99]Fuck.
[64:16.03]Well, I'm stuck here.
[64:17.55]We're stuck here for 34 minutes.
[64:26.73]Oh, look at this, a Bulbo!
[64:29.61]At least I have my gun.
[64:32.67]Bulbo tree?
[64:35.01]Well, I'll be waiting for him.
[64:36.44]What is that?
[64:37.04]I would be fine if you lit yourself on fire.
[64:47.46]Jesus Christ!
[64:51.02]This is food!
[64:54.93]Holy shit.
[64:55.69]I just figured out the way to get max HP.
[65:02.51]I guess I can't go over max.
[65:04.59]That's fine though.
[65:07.21]This is planted in the right conditions.
[65:10.47]Weird.
[65:11.09]Okay.
[65:13.05]Everybody gave me shit yesterday.
[65:14.49]This is what I was talking about.
[65:15.39]I saw somebody play this game.
[65:17.95]They were on a beach and they were crafting stuff.
[65:20.71]So I was not wrong.
[65:24.50]There's no beaches in this game, you fucking idiot.
[65:27.46]Yes, there is.
[65:28.64]I'm on one right now.
[65:32.88]Can I break this?
[65:42.05]I got a gun, though.
[65:42.79]That's good.
[65:43.69]I'm going over there.
[65:44.29]I want to see what's over here.
[65:46.77]Wait, what's that?
[65:49.57]Oh, it's one of these fucking things.
[65:50.61]Let me just shoot it.
[65:54.74]This thing is awesome.
[65:56.18]I'm so glad I have an actual weapon.
[65:58.28]This... What's going on here?
[66:05.95]What did I do?
[66:08.19]Did I do something wrong?
[66:15.26]Uh... Okay.
[66:19.24]Okay.
[66:23.36]That was very... Wait, what are the... Why is it alive again?
[66:30.28]So it's back to life.
[66:32.46]Come here, you little asshole.
[66:33.94]Oh my lord.
[66:34.64]We stopped moving.
[66:36.59]I'm riding on top of him.
[66:41.51]Okay, just fuck it.
[66:42.27]I want to go in the giant weird Lego building.
[66:45.83]Can I please go in the upside down Gears of War weapon, please?
[66:50.29]What is this?
[66:53.82]I can't scan this.
[66:58.87]Well, this is obviously alien life.
[67:05.91]What is with my fucking frame rate?
[67:07.51]Why is this so bad right now?
[67:09.35]I don't understand.
[67:09.95]I didn't do anything.
[67:13.49]What?
[67:18.06]This game got a lot weirder right now.
[67:20.28]Force field control terminal.
[67:29.50]Can't go in here.
[67:33.30]Put in my iPad.
[67:35.61]I can't.
[67:36.07]I only got 30 more minutes to kill until we can leave, apparently.
[67:41.69]Just do noclip.
[67:52.44]How much do I recommend the game?
[67:55.55]I would say, if you're a fan of survival, just exploration games, this is very... It's very fun.
[68:04.02]It's not that expensive either.
[68:05.16]It's only, what, like $25?
[68:07.10]$24?
[68:08.60]That's not bad, considering the amount of stuff you can probably do in this game.
[68:13.70]What even is this thing?
[68:20.65]So I can't do anything here.
[68:24.40]This was a waste of time.
[68:26.60]Unless I can get up there.
[68:27.65]Is there a main entrance?
[68:34.19]Alright, I guess we can go down.
[68:37.47]Why does my sea moss have to be beached?
[68:39.21]That's so annoying.
[68:48.32]Shit.
[68:51.02]I can't go down that far.
[68:52.06]I'm going to be in big trouble.
[68:59.68]No, I'm not going down this far.
[69:04.60]In about 10 seconds.
[69:08.55]Right, there's oil.
[69:09.09]There's oil.
[69:09.41]There's oil.
[69:09.91]Oil.
[69:10.19]Oil.
[69:10.47]Oil.
[69:11.93]Let me just scan the oil.
[69:14.67]Quickly.
[69:14.99]Quickly.
[69:15.29]Quickly.
[69:15.57]Come on.
[69:15.79]Come on.
[69:15.99]Come on.
[69:17.91]What's going on?
[69:18.63]What's wrong with me?
[69:21.18]What is this?
[69:21.56]I don't know what to do with this.
[69:23.06]Can I go in there?
[69:26.56]I think I'm burning.
[69:29.53]shale I got lithium lithium lithium I need lithium go back scan the oil oh I might have waited too long this is very far down oh my god this is too far
[70:57.41]Where's my C?
[70:58.13]Wait, there's a fucking call on the radio.
[71:04.01]Jerma endorses... That sounded sarcastic?
[71:14.42]No, I was serious!
[71:16.50]Oh, goddammit.
[71:17.36]Hold on.
[71:49.68]Looks good, right?
[71:50.37]Let's get a happy sign.
[71:59.51]Here we go.
[72:07.06]Harassing developers, what?
[72:09.64]The game is already released!
[72:11.60]The game's out already!
[72:13.24]There's no, there's no, the game is released!
[72:16.59]They don't even check those!
[72:17.95]You think somebody checks those fucking emails?
[72:21.13]The game's been out for like fucking three weeks!
[72:23.17]That guy, that's job it is, the community manager probably just like, browses through them.
[72:26.91]They've already fixed all the bugs.
[72:28.39]The game is a polished, there's nothing, there's no bugs.
[72:31.43]The game is a polished masterpiece of a fucking technical video game.
[72:35.39]No one is sending bug reports anymore, they're gonna laugh at that.
[72:38.43]and some guy's gonna fucking send it to HR, and I'm gonna get a job there, and I'm gonna get hired!
[72:47.90]Where's my CMOS?
[72:51.92]As a developer, I can assure you they read... Do I have to send another one?
[72:59.33]Where's my CMOS?
[73:01.67]It's gone.
[73:04.91]It's a thousand meters away.
[73:08.28]Oh shit.
[73:22.55]I didn't spam the feature.
[73:23.87]I sent two pieces of feedback.
[73:26.75]How many people are here watching the stream right now?
[73:29.85]I haven't checked in like 40 minutes.
[73:31.63]How many people are here?
[73:36.74]Look, alright, there's like 2,500 people here.
[73:41.36]I just said to 2,500 people that this game is fun, alright?
[73:45.51]So do you think that developer's gonna be angry with me that I sent him like a shitty response on his feedback?
[73:52.27]No, in 25 minutes, a developer's gonna come into TeamSpeak and we're gonna have a conversation about the, ow, fuck.
[74:01.84]Where am I going?
[74:06.19]That didn't do anything for me.
[74:10.25]What did this say?
[74:20.97]Go to the sunbeam.
[74:22.01]I've got 25 minutes.
[74:23.35]That's plenty of time.
[74:27.22]Just go already.
[74:28.50]Just... Why don't you calm down?
[74:35.99]Alright.
[74:36.63]Uh, what was I doing?
[74:38.57]Do I crumple or fold my toilet paper?
[74:41.48]That's a good question.
[74:42.24]Let's actually address this because it's a pretty important topic.
[74:45.44]Uh, so when I go, when I use the toilet paper, what I do is I just kind of like, I grab a bunch of it.
[74:50.68]Like I go and maybe like nine or 10 sheets and I'd wrap it.
[74:57.55]I spin it around the hand.
[74:59.69]And then I take that spun around almost like it's yarn.
[75:03.49]Right.
[75:04.59]I take that spun around.
[75:06.86]I fold it right so it's a nice thick.
[75:09.22]Done.
[75:10.14]Throw it away.
[75:10.68]Another like 30 sheets.
[75:14.72]Fold that again.
[75:16.09]One wipe into the trash.
[75:18.03]Fold it again.
[75:20.15]Wipe into the garbage.
[75:22.17]And then I flush the toilet.
[75:24.95]That's how I do it.
[75:34.05]Alright, let's go.
[75:35.61]What was I doing?
[75:36.69]I have 24 minutes until the sunbeam.
[75:40.37]I'm wasting time.
[75:41.79]Yeah, welcome to the entirety of my live stream.
[75:51.58]Okay.
[75:53.80]Where's my vase?
[75:56.89]Jessica, alright.
[75:58.73]Oh, I hit my balls.
[76:00.75]Isn't that funny?
[76:04.99]Let's go back.
[76:05.57]I got 23 minutes.
[76:13.80]Uh, at what point do you wipe your ass?
[76:16.62]So, uh, pretty much every time.
[76:19.92]Don't fuck the ha-has!
[76:21.10]Get out of here!
[76:21.70]Uh, when I use the bathroom... Alright, now I understand why you did it in the first place.
[76:27.34]I'd say, like, every... every four seconds when I'm in the bathroom.
[76:33.53]Realistically, without any jokes or anything like that, no fucking around, I use probably one or two rolls of toilet paper per bathroom break.
[76:44.59]And so half the time I don't even use it to wipe my bottom.
[76:48.14]Sometimes I just do it just to look at it and like shred it up and throw it in the trash or the toilet.
[76:53.14]I like to look at it like to like just roll it down and wear it as a scarf and then throw it in the trash.
[76:58.22]I do a lot of like weird shit in the bathroom.
[77:00.64]So like it takes about one full roll of toilet paper every time I go to the bathroom.
[77:10.49]And then I just turn the shower on.
[77:11.69]I take the shower head and I like put it up there.
[77:13.94]And it cleans it perfectly fine.
[77:15.15]You don't even need toilet paper.
[77:16.05]I just like play with it for fun.
[77:39.49]I love that this whole thing, somebody just said... Somebody just said, Jerma, the glider doesn't work above water.
[77:47.72]Completely ignoring all the dumb shit I'm saying right now.
[77:52.72]Alright, 21 minutes.
[77:53.70]Sunbeam is gonna be here.
[77:59.41]No, I don't sh- Please.
[78:01.33]It was a joke.
[78:03.67]I just lost 15 viewers because of that?
[78:07.06]No, I didn't.
[78:08.56]They're just X-ing out for a second.
[78:12.66]They went to Reddit.
[78:13.32]They'll come right back.
[78:17.34]Alright, 21.
[78:18.14]Let's go right up the path here.
[78:22.95]Joke incoming.
[78:24.35]I don't have any jokes incoming.
[78:26.77]You got all the jokes that were going to happen tonight.
[78:28.47]They already happened.
[78:32.57]I got nothing else.
[78:36.23]check the ship what do you mean the ship nice hair don't you dare say that about my hair how much I'm crashing no I'm not I'm fine can I even go can I go up here alright you can't just walk up a straight line
[78:59.67]Good.
[79:00.61]Good.
[79:00.97]Good thing they, uh... There's a ca- Let- I'm gonna take a- Let me actually, like, explore this area.
[79:05.80]I don't wanna just fuck around.
[79:07.84]There's a purple- Wait a minute.
[79:08.90]Purple tablet.
[79:11.90]Um... Yeah.
[79:14.18]That looks like it goes down here, right?
[79:17.29]Don't break my legs.
[79:19.15]I'm fine.
[79:20.65]Purple tablet fragment?
[79:22.71]I have a pr- I have a tablet!
[79:28.60]Okay.
[79:29.12]Let me just see what this is.
[79:31.17]This carbon-based device is lighter than it looks and features a symbol which resembles a U lit up in purple.
[79:38.17]Despite the onboard power still functioning, algae growth on the exterior indicates it was abandoned hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.
[79:43.59]It's dumb.
[79:47.19]Let's put it in.
[79:50.69]Is this going to open?
[79:53.27]It is.
[79:54.51]Holy shit.
[79:56.54]New content, guys.
[79:57.84]Get ready.
[79:59.78]At least a good thing I got a gun.
[80:07.96]Jerma just plays this game ironically.
[80:10.80]What are you talking about?
[80:11.64]I got inside of the Gears of War heavy machine gun.
[80:19.51]You think I'm like playing the game ironically?
[80:21.99]This game is good.
[80:23.31]Did you see the feedback I sent to the developer?
[80:26.23]It's a great game.
[80:27.97]It's very valuable.
[80:29.05]This is not a $60 game.
[80:30.59]This is a $25 game.
[80:32.88]You see the content that's in this fucking game?
[80:38.32]Developers wish they could put this much content in a video game.
[80:47.17]And look, I'm just very clearly going to pick up the...
[80:50.65]What's a Silicon Valley developer?
[80:51.97]No, what's the name of that stupid dev that, like, catastrophically failed?
[80:55.97]They made, like, three shit games after they made one good game.
[80:58.97]Come on, give it to me.
[80:59.97]Give it to me.
[81:00.39]Give it to me.
[81:02.20]Silicon Knights.
[81:04.08]And the game was... I'll take GameCube games for $500, Alex.
[81:10.78]Yeah, okay, that's a daily double.
[81:12.93]The game was... What is the game?
[81:18.27]This game developer made this game back in 2007, and it was a GameCube exclusive, and it was a very fun game based around your mental fortitude.
[81:28.28]Alex, what is... Wait, don't buzz me yet.
[81:32.70]Alex, what is... Oh!
[81:37.38]What the fuck is it?
[81:42.13]I lost.
[81:42.61]I lost the Daily Double.
[81:44.71]It's the Eternal Darkness.
[81:46.30]I was too late.
[81:48.36]I was making an Eternal Darkness symbol reference.
[81:50.74]Who cares?
[81:52.36]Fucking idiot loser.
[81:54.84]What a dumb loser I am.
[81:57.72]That's a terrible Alex Trebek.
[82:02.39]Well, at least I got it.
[82:05.29]Can I scan this?
[82:06.01]No.
[82:12.34]Sorry, we were looking for eternal darkness.
[82:15.50]I've been hosting the same exact fucking quiz show, Shitface, for 45 years.
[82:22.92]Does anybody remember any of the other TV shows I've ever done?
[82:28.79]Pick up the Ion Cube.
[82:32.33]Okay.
[82:37.13]Everybody just knows Alex Trebek as the Jeopardy guy.
[82:41.36]Do you remember anything else I've done?
[82:43.10]Okay.
[82:52.02]Interesting.
[82:52.42]I think I can pick up more than one of these.
[82:53.91]There's a few of them.
[82:56.83]Nice.
[82:57.15]Okay.
[82:57.87]Can I scan it?
[82:58.51]Scan it.
[83:03.39]Ion cube.
[83:03.97]There's another one of these.
[83:12.03]Data terminal.
[83:12.85]Unknown language.
[83:13.47]Attempting translation.
[83:19.03]Okay.
[83:21.57]This is getting a little weird here.
[83:22.61]So this is like an alien colony that took over?
[83:26.19]The Price is Right is Bob Barker.
[83:27.57]That's not Alex Trebek.
[83:29.33]I know they look similar.
[83:30.83]Oh boy.
[83:40.02]Looks like we're going down.
[83:45.72]Is there an alien down here or something that I'm going to have to kill with a gun?
[83:52.24]This is kind of cool, though.
[83:53.38]I do like this.
[83:56.11]Even further down we go.
[84:01.77]Hmm.
[84:04.73]Should I keep... Is there a monster in here?
[84:07.91]Let's turn on my little spin device.
[84:14.14]Where is this going to take us?
[84:20.14]Jesus, where is this?
[84:26.12]What is down here?
[84:26.84]There's like weird jellyfish down here.
[84:28.22]Are these fish?
[84:34.95]What?
[84:35.19]There's just like peepers down here.
[84:36.83]Come on, really?
[84:37.63]I need to go check this out.
[84:43.17]200 meters?
[84:44.75]How far down can I go?
[84:45.51]300, right?
[84:47.89]No, I'm not doing the same mistake twice.
[84:51.39]Sorry, that's not going to happen twice.
[84:54.52]I want to check this out over here.
[85:01.82]I'm fine.
[85:05.84]I'm not going to die again.
[85:07.05]No, I'm not.
[85:07.95]I'm making sure I don't die again.
[85:09.35]I'm not going to die.
[85:15.03]Everybody's freaking out.
[85:16.95]He's gonna die again!
[85:17.99]Oh shit, I almost didn't.
[85:26.33]Okay.
[85:26.57]What's the difference between Jerma's IQ and his oxygen level?
[85:29.81]Not much.
[85:36.24]Really?
[85:36.70]So, 135.
[85:37.68]That's pretty goddamn good, actually.
[85:42.14]I will take a 135 IQ.
[85:48.43]That's really smart.
[85:50.75]That's like top level human.
[85:55.75]Grab another one.
[85:59.87]I'm very confused of what is in here.
[86:04.48]This turned into a different game.
[86:10.78]Flustered?
[86:11.50]I'm very relaxed.
[86:12.84]What are you talking about?
[86:15.28]I'm as relaxed as you could be.
[86:16.51]Went 13 minutes.
[86:22.77]that's a clever way to make me not drown remember my scanner what do you know Etalyx alien arch and then ladies and gentlemen please stand for the intel conference 2018. here it is the intel sandy bridge the I-10 2700.
[87:09.01]I'll get a baby even come out of your vagina.
[87:24.22]I was... I was trying... Shoot out.
[87:29.42]You have a... No.
[87:32.09]As a comedy person... Okay, I typed in I'm sorry into YouTube and that's the first thing that came up.
[87:37.85]Literally, youtube.com, I typed in, I'm sorry.
[87:40.16]I was trying to get somebody to say, I'm sorry, that's not me.
[87:43.00]And I'm sorry, season one trailer.
[87:48.14]So that is not what I expected.
[87:54.54]I was looking for an apology.
[87:55.65]So let me do a double apology.
[87:58.25]I'm sorry that I tried to say I'm sorry through somebody that wasn't me.
[88:01.55]And I'm sorry that you got to hear that version of me saying sorry.
[88:05.83]But I'm sorry because that was a bad joke.
[88:10.97]Fucking god damn it.
[88:13.90]And I'm going to starve to death.
[88:14.86]You think I'm going to starve to death?
[88:15.74]You think I'm that stupid?
[88:16.70]I've got some cured... I'm fine.
[88:28.51]You were saying?
[88:31.51]If you have anybody that says you were saying, just fucking don't be friends with them anymore.
[88:37.18]You know those people that, you know, you talk to them and you have a conversation and you get proved wrong and they go, you were saying?
[88:44.10]Stop hanging out with that person.
[88:57.37]What's in here, fish?
[88:58.49]Alien device!
[89:00.76]Wow.
[89:03.18]A doomsday device.
[89:04.28]Can I pick this up?
[89:09.05]How do I collect it?
[89:09.95]Can I collect it?
[89:12.81]I guess it's just a doomsday device.
[89:14.77]Somebody said bye.
[89:21.58]Why are you leaving?
[89:31.33]It sure does, and I have another tablet.
[89:38.64]Open sesame, please.
[89:42.64]Why am I running?
[89:43.37]Because I feel like it.
[89:46.87]Alright.
[89:49.67]What is everybody's favorite time of year?
[89:53.73]Spring, summer, fall, winter.
[89:55.07]Go ahead.
[89:55.41]Let's see.
[90:02.26]Fall.
[90:02.46]Fall.
[90:07.73]What was it?
[90:08.25]Okay.
[90:08.53]Well, I just got injected with something.
[90:13.18]Come on.
[90:17.02]Energy core.
[90:22.36]This planet is under quarantine.
[90:27.46]Interesting.
[90:28.02]Okay.
[90:31.38]Should I do it again?
[90:37.45]It just stabs you.
[90:38.25]That's all it does.
[90:41.24]Alien facility locations.
[90:44.44]Really?
[90:49.58]Alien data.
[90:51.72]Doomsday.
[90:52.98]Scans indicate this device contains enough potential energy to destroy the entire planet, along with most of the solar system.
[91:01.08]Fortunately, it has malfunctioned.
[91:04.08]Okay.
[91:04.18]Okay.
[91:09.91]So there's alien facilities that are all over the place around here.
[91:15.61]Locations, here we go.
[91:21.83]Intercepted background data regarding further alien facilities elsewhere on the planet.
[91:27.50]Disease research facility, depth 800 meters.
[91:30.90]Cave system with extensive fossil records southwest of enforcement platform.
[91:38.42]Where the fuck are these?
[91:42.28]Is this the enforcement platform?
[91:43.72]I don't know.
[91:50.26]Uh, I need to get back out there, because... Should it stab me again?
[91:55.00]Does this hurt me?
[91:58.53]Do I learn anything else?
[92:01.97]No.
[92:02.69]Alright.
[92:03.43]Let's destroy the fucking mother brain.
[92:09.68]Well, okay, that didn't do anything.
[92:10.98]That's fine.
[92:14.50]Alright.
[92:17.44]I'm gonna get to the sunbeam.
[92:18.58]Everybody calm down.
[92:21.14]You think I'm not gonna get to the sunbeam location?
[92:24.50]Well, you are very wrong.
[92:27.58]Whoops.
[92:33.12]How do I get out of here?
[92:38.17]I don't know how to get out of here.
[92:42.16]I only have 30 seconds to get in.
[92:44.26]What do you mean 30?
[92:44.94]To get in the what?
[92:45.74]The sunbeam?
[92:49.48]I don't know how to get out of the alien facility.
[92:51.38]That's not my fault.
[92:52.10]This place is a joke.
[92:55.42]I got seven minutes.
[92:57.48]Here we go.
[92:58.20]I know how to get out of here from here.
[92:59.76]Take a left here.
[93:06.11]There we go.
[93:07.63]Force field.
[93:08.29]Let me take the scanner out just in case I need to scan anything else.
[93:12.91]Go back up.
[93:17.09]I'm not going to make it.
[93:18.93]If you don't think I could make it back to the surface in six and a half minutes, I think you might have an insanity complex.
[93:31.72]Maybe.
[93:34.28]uh here is the okay back this way I'm never gonna make it how would I never make it it's right here self scan quick okay okay I I have I have like the flu
[94:05.35]I already got the data here.
[94:06.23]I'm pretty sure I'm going the right way.
[94:13.44]Oh no, it's terminal.
[94:17.78]I have the flu, it's terminal.
[94:22.28]Look, I have five minutes to get here.
[94:25.77]You guys, seriously.
[94:33.79]Anything else to scan?
[94:35.85]Well, now I have a little bit of time.
[94:37.41]Let's take a moment and collect some wildlife.
[94:40.71]Maybe eat some fish.
[94:42.65]This guy right here.
[94:44.83]What is he?
[94:45.19]He's an angler fish.
[94:47.80]What is he?
[94:48.14]A biter.
[94:52.42]I wonder what he does.
[94:56.52]I am gonna guess he bites.
[95:00.66]So do I. Fucking deckhead.
[95:03.28]Alright, let's go back.
[95:07.47]I'm not gonna drown.
[95:08.81]You guys think I'm that bad that I'm gonna drown down here?
[95:11.25]Wait, what's this?
[95:13.45]Alright, I need to see what this is.
[95:16.38]There's another complex down here.
[95:20.12]Four minutes.
[95:22.50]Interesting.
[95:23.12]We have some more alien technology gonna go underneath?
[95:27.83]Not yet, no.
[95:35.03]Anything else I can do here?
[95:36.35]Come on.
[95:36.91]Scanner?
[95:44.34]Nothing.
[95:46.48]Alright.
[95:47.14]I'm not going to fuck around.
[95:47.88]Let's go back up.
[95:51.70]Wait.
[95:52.14]What's this?
[95:56.57]No.
[95:56.89]Okay.
[95:58.61]Back up.
[96:06.41]Consuming three times.
[96:07.56]I'm fine.
[96:10.66]No.
[96:10.96]Why is everybody saying no?
[96:13.64]I'm very clearly, completely, and totally fine.
[96:20.04]What can I be scared of with 135 O2 IQ?
[96:21.22]Here's where the Sunbeam comes in.
[96:31.60]I've got time.
[96:32.34]Three minutes.
[96:32.87]We can scrape the edge here.
[96:34.65]Maybe pick up a couple of resources.
[96:35.91]That'll be fine.
[96:36.53]What's this?
[96:39.01]Uh, excuse me.
[96:39.93]Creature egg.
[96:46.15]I don't want to run into that thing.
[96:48.03]That's one of those weird shark monsters.
[96:49.77]Let's go up here.
[96:52.71]I want to grab that.
[96:53.25]What is that?
[96:54.44]Okay, I got a hoop fish.
[97:02.42]He can't swim faster than me because I'm swimming very fast with this device.
[97:06.76]Yeah.
[97:07.69]Left him in the dust.
[97:12.97]2 minutes and 35 seconds.
[97:17.45]We are good to go.
[97:18.77]And everybody that said I wasn't going to make it.
[97:23.32]2 minutes to spare.
[97:26.84]He's never gonna do it.
[97:28.00]He's an idiot.
[97:29.42]He's so bad.
[97:30.43]He's so stupid.
[97:31.31]The sunbeam's gonna leave without him.
[97:36.11]I can't believe he's a stupid.
[97:41.43]Where does it go?
[97:42.19]Shit.
[97:55.08]It lands right here.
[97:56.58]Okay, I'm ready.
[97:58.63]So what are we going to do for two minutes?
[98:01.11]Eat the tree.
[98:01.85]Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[98:03.27]You can carve the giant pineapple.
[98:11.23]Any more trees?
[98:11.87]Yep, over here.
[98:12.33]Okay.
[98:21.76]I'll just eat these all day.
[98:22.80]These things are great.
[98:26.76]Alright, so whatever lands here, I'm ready for it.
[98:28.28]I got full health, full HP, full, I might say, hunger power, I mean.
[98:38.30]I'm ready.
[98:39.81]Okay.
[98:40.61]Gun is out.
[98:42.57]In case there is something that's here that I don't want to fight.
[98:47.29]I'm ready.
[98:47.93]I'm going to sit in the trees and I'm going to charge the beam up.
[98:49.91]I'm going to kill somebody.
[98:54.00]My frame rate is equal to my IQ 135 48 seconds 40 seconds 30 seconds
[99:23.88]I'm hearing noises.
[99:30.72]What was that?
[99:32.70]Should I be concerned about this?
[99:33.70]I mean, look up.
[99:45.04]Okay, here we go, 10, sat 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
[99:54.37]Happy New Year everybody!
[99:57.39]Second New Year in a row!
[100:05.57]It's been such a great year!
[100:17.57]Where is it?
[100:20.77]Oh there it is!
[100:21.23]It's coming down!
[100:29.36]Wait, maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[100:46.19]Happy fucking New Year, everybody, again!
[100:55.10]Okay, um...
[100:59.04]That's too bad.
[101:00.76]Oh well.
[101:04.84]Wait, you thought I was going to miss it?
[101:06.02]Why would I miss it?
[101:07.84]I'm sitting there staring at it.
[101:14.47]Those weren't memes.
[101:15.41]Those were actual people.
[101:18.27]Let's go investigate.
[101:19.07]I'm going to walk up the actual path here with the hairdryer.
[101:21.97]No fucking batteries.
[101:24.61]God damn it.
[101:25.39]There we go.
[101:28.27]I've got an ion battery now.
[101:30.09]Right, there it goes.
[101:30.89]It's a giant weapon.
[101:32.93]I told you it was a Gears of War weapon.
[101:36.01]Everybody talked a bunch of shit.
[101:40.62]This is Commander Shepard's weapon from Gears of War 3.
[101:54.76]Boxes?
[101:56.50]No.
[101:59.18]Anything else I can do with this?
[102:02.04]That's the worst reaction I've seen.
[102:04.06]What do you mean, worst reaction?
[102:06.04]What do you want me to do?
[102:07.70]Be like, oh, there's the ship.
[102:10.33]There it is.
[102:11.03]Hold on.
[102:12.39]Can we rewind?
[102:13.41]Can I rewind and do it again?
[102:14.41]I don't think I can, right?
[102:18.33]Let me give you a proper reaction.
[102:22.11]Hold on.
[102:29.35]Hold on.
[102:30.00]You'll get it.

[103:55.97]I don't have a big head.
[103:56.87]I have a tiny head.
[104:01.78]There's nothing else to do here, I don't think.
[104:08.08]That's it.
[104:08.56]I'm un-watching.

[105:24.75]You got it.
[105:26.85]What we do here in Jerma985 is we take chat requests.
[105:31.48]If I see a request, I'm gonna do it.
[105:35.20]What did somebody say?
[105:35.84]Swim down?
[105:37.73]Okay.
[105:39.49]I'm going to swim down and I'm going to find a cave system just for you.
[105:43.81]Take a look.
[105:44.45]A cave here.
[105:45.31]This is kind of spooky, kind of scary.
[105:50.54]Maybe I should scan some of these things.
[105:53.92]I think I'm going to try to do that.
[105:55.22]I think I'm going to scan some of these things.
[105:58.62]Wow.
[106:01.06]Cave bush.
[106:03.82]Maybe I'm going to take a little bit of a simple...

[106:59.66]I'm fine.
[107:03.14]I'm not dead, I'm fine.
[107:09.67]Without the memes, I'm going to degrade to pre-Twitch Jerma.
[107:14.62]What does that mean?
[107:18.72]My IQ must be decreasing.
[107:20.10]1 plus 1 is 2.
[107:20.42]2 plus 2 is 4.
[107:20.66]4 plus 4 is 8.
[107:21.32]8 plus 8 is 16.
[107:21.64]16 plus 8 is 45.
[107:22.04]45 plus 45 is 90.
[107:22.36]90 plus 90 is 180.
[107:22.64]180 times 5 is 790.
[107:23.26]790 times 20 is 3000.
[107:23.66]Yeah, like my IQ is fucking degrading.
[107:39.14]Give it a rest.
[107:42.54]Got the sea boss back.
[107:56.24]Explore the mountain.
[107:56.82]I want to see what these things do first.
[108:02.12]You were saying?
[108:02.87]What do you mean?
[108:13.73]Send a sarcastic bug report.
[108:15.57]No, we already did that and it wasn't even funny.
[108:19.79]Shit, I need to get those memes back.
[108:21.77]Let me like pull them out of the trash can.
[108:30.43]Disrespecting other content creators.
[108:32.25]Who did I name specifically?
[108:35.03]I didn't name anybody.
[108:39.69]Is this pre-recorded?
[108:40.65]No, Vorthos.
[108:41.53]It is not pre-recorded.
[108:43.23]I'm here, right now.
[108:46.85]See, ready?
[108:47.21]I'm gonna tell you.
[108:48.05]Vorthos.

[108:49.61]Click two.
[108:50.43]Click three.
[108:51.25]Told you.
[108:56.18]I'm not... What do you mean?
[108:58.14]I'm not making fun of any particular person.
[109:00.18]I'm making fun of an idea.
[109:05.94]How do you know this is not pre-recorded?
[109:07.22]Okay.
[109:08.44]Okay.
[109:10.10]You know that thing everybody says where it's pre-recorded unless somebody does X or Y or Z?
[109:16.50]What do you want me to do?
[109:18.76]What do you want me to do?
[109:20.19]How do I prove that it's not pre-recorded?
[109:21.55]What do I do?
[109:24.03]How do I prove this to you guys?
[109:25.59]This stream is not pre-recorded.
[109:28.15]Tell me.
[109:28.37]Tell me something to do.
[109:33.10]I would rather saw my hand off with a handsaw than dab again.
[109:37.59]No, really, dab on stream.
[109:40.57]I would rather take my hand and like with a handsaw.
[109:45.75]Not on stream.
[109:46.39]What the hell was that?
[109:59.78]Pre-recorded or saw hand off.
[110:03.74]Show us your hour.
[110:05.98]Show us your hour.
[110:10.41]Wait.
[110:11.83]Fine.
[110:13.15]You want proof?
[110:14.83]I'll give you the proof that you fucking so desire.
[110:17.50]Fine.
[110:19.06]Let's take a screenshot of right here, the chat.
[110:21.72]Everybody here.
[110:23.52]And the time.
[110:25.06]I'm going to turn the phone over.
[110:25.90]You're going to see.
[110:29.05]Just wait.
[110:30.81]I'm going to prove to the one guy that cares in this chat that this is actually like a live stream.
[110:36.61]Here we go.
[110:39.32]Need the time in there too, get out of the way, there's a bunch of beer cans in the way, hold on.
[110:48.28]Okay, so as you can see here, we got what was just happening in chat, you see the time there.
[110:59.08]See the time there?
[110:59.93]11, you can't even see shit, hold on, let me zoom in. 11.36.
[111:10.00]11.36 p.m.
[111:11.40]As you can see, take a look at this chat.
[111:14.64]Here is the chatter right here that said Jerma is the fucking man.
[111:23.53]That's me.
[111:25.59]Can I play the game now?
[111:31.35]What if I just do this?
[111:34.28]Everyone wants like a facecam.
[111:35.28]What about like a chest cam?
[111:44.37]No, I can't do this.
[111:45.85]This is like, this is like, this is meta in a mili... No, I'm not gonna give you guys like any meta jokes to make.
[111:54.30]No.
[111:57.00]God damn it, what the fuck have I done?
[111:58.86]Hold on.
[112:05.42]Can't close it.
[112:07.36]Hey, that's where the face came on, guys.
[112:08.64]What do you say?
[112:13.07]Arm cam?
[112:13.55]What's like a cam that nobody would ever want?
[112:19.39]Mailbox cam?
[112:20.29]No, what if the mailman actually comes and I get him on camera?
[112:25.57]Okay, I want to go back to base.
[112:28.63]Going the wrong way for that.
[112:31.65]Nose cam?
[112:32.74]Okay.
[112:33.88]Let's get that out there.
[112:37.16]I got a huge nose too, this would be perfect.
[112:40.63]I'm going to change the title to Subnautica with Nosecam.
[113:02.09]I can't move though.
[113:20.89]I don't think you know how hard this is to do.
[113:24.87]Wait, hold on, it's not the whole nose.
[113:26.13]I look like a dinosaur.
[113:35.01]I look like a fucking T-Rex from here.
[113:46.82]You don't know how hard this is to do.
[113:50.86]I can't fucking move.
[113:54.66]Yeah.
[114:21.84]Nose hair cam.
[114:27.65]Single eye cam?
[114:28.58]Alright, I'll try that too.
[114:29.60]That's gonna be easier, I think.
[115:00.83]Okay, let's play.
[115:33.12]Alright, whatever the fuck am I doing a cut stop it.
[115:37.10]What am I doing?
[115:38.56]Why am I doing this?
[115:41.00]I'm just like ruining the broadcast for fucking like 3,000 people like what the fuck?
[115:46.36]Where's my actual face?
[115:49.05]I don't even I've got a full-screen OBS because I have no idea what my actual face is.
[115:58.09]I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[115:59.09]What is that?
[116:03.08]It's so pixelated, I don't even know where I am.
[116:05.22]Oh, alright, that's my mouth, okay.
[116:09.60]Let me just refresh this, hold on one second.
[116:19.07]Hold on, let me just refresh my mouth here a second.
[116:23.39]There we go, okay.
[116:24.93]That's my nose.
[116:28.28]And let me just make sure I got this right.
[116:34.36]Come on, give me that one.
[116:37.41]What a great fucking broadcast this has been, huh?
[116:44.17]I gotta go dental.
[116:45.75]What was I doing?
[116:51.95]Fucking hell.
[116:57.75]That meme funeral just, like, fucked me up.
[117:00.73]Like, I might have to, like, I might have to go here in, like, 20 minutes.
[117:04.19]That wasn't, I wasn't giving the middle finger to you guys.
[117:06.05]That was not the middle finger to you.
[117:08.11]That was the middle finger to the guy behind you.
[117:10.84]Is somebody else, how long are my fingernails?
[117:12.46]Ooh, boy.
[117:14.76]These are long.
[117:16.44]Is that embarrassing?
[117:17.52]Should I be embarrassed by that?
[117:18.64]Probably.
[117:19.44]I don't care, whatever.
[117:20.14]Fuck the world.
[117:23.63]I went... Let's play the game for a little bit, please.
[117:31.02]Middle finger to the establishment.
[117:32.84]I got my... What is this?
[117:42.09]Oh, that's my sea moss.
[117:46.89]Alright.
[117:49.43]Let's make a little bit of food.
[117:50.63]We got a cooked hoop fish.
[117:55.86]Alright.
[117:56.68]Let's take a look at that alien data.
[117:59.75]Or whatever.
[118:01.21]I don't know.
[118:01.67]Whatever.
[118:03.75]Public domain.
[118:05.31]Mickey Mouse will be there soon.
[118:06.77]In about two or three years, Mickey Mouse will be public domain.
[118:09.50]That is not a joke.
[118:11.26]That is... Which one of these has... This one does.
[118:14.62]Okay.
[118:18.06]Do I... I have one earbud in because I'm scared of the scary monster?
[118:20.62]No.
[118:22.18]I have one earbud in because I'm a moron.
[118:26.42]And I cannot handle two headphones on it once.
[118:30.08]That's not a lie.
[118:31.86]I can't handle the actual stereo sound because I can't hear myself talk.
[118:36.70]And if I can't hear myself talk, then I have trouble.
[118:40.87]Call me what you want.
[118:41.81]Call me names.
[118:42.49]Because whatever, I don't care.
[118:48.15]I can't wear two headphones.
[118:53.14]Let's build a base.
[118:53.84]Why is a fucking facecam on?
[118:55.32]Turn this off.
[118:56.46]This is just not even centered.
[118:59.38]What a great stream this has been.
[119:02.35]Actually, it's been a fucking fantastic stream.
[119:04.59]Get out of town.
[119:08.43]Let me get this.
[119:10.57]I'm not doing a facecam.
[119:11.95]Facecam is a stupid thing that I don't want.
[119:15.34]I refuse to have it.
[119:16.32]Let me just move it out of the way.
[119:40.54]Look at how bad I look with just like the middle of my face.
[119:44.92]Do I look this bad?
[119:50.09]I look really bad with just the center of my face, huh?
[119:53.67]Jesus Christ.
[119:55.84]What was that?
[119:59.60]No, what actually was that?
[120:00.56]Something hit the...
[120:12.03]It was nothing.
[120:12.47]Okay.
[120:12.75]Let me take a look at the alien data.
[120:18.54]I have a new... I want to actually listen to the data bank here.
[120:22.34]Vehicles.
[120:24.40]Cyclops.
[120:27.98]Okay.
[120:30.62]So, can I not make this yet?
[120:34.94]I already have a CMOS.
[120:37.29]Alien Arch Energy Core...
[120:41.38]Should I go look at the other alien places?
[120:48.43]Crew 6, log 2.
[120:52.15]I look like a Kingdom Hearts character.
[120:55.69]Where can I find the Cyclops parts?
[121:08.60]Let's go to the crash ship.
[121:09.76]Alright, let's get some food.
[121:10.64]Let's go to the crash ship again.
[121:11.90]I got plenty of stuff.
[121:17.26]If I hear one more Tide Pod joke, I'm going to delete my Twitch and never stream again.
[121:22.93]Be aware of that.
[121:36.53]Shit, I'm out of batteries.
[121:42.00]Mickey Mouse.
[121:48.93]Let's just get some more food cooked.
[121:52.25]And we're going to go from here.
[121:53.36]We're going to check out the ship again.
[121:55.22]I'm going to go underneath the ship.
[121:57.00]Take a look.
[122:00.17]Yeah, I mean, by the way, there has to be a certain amount of Tide Pod jokes to query my secretary to delete this channel.
[122:09.31]So we're talking about this channel with my shit face.
[122:13.11]If there are four or five hundred thousand Tide Pod jokes over the course of the next three days, then my Twitch channel will be deleted.
[122:22.00]Put the Twitch webcam in your garbage.
[122:29.02]Put the cam in the garbage can.
[122:37.59]Okay.
[122:37.69]Let me get in the fucking trash.
[122:47.92]You think I'm kidding around?
[122:48.90]You're going in the garbage can.
[122:50.60]I took out the trash, but you can go right in here.
[122:52.38]No like personal information in here, right?
[122:54.64]I don't have like a bank statement in here, do I?
[122:56.51]Hey.
[122:58.59]Oh, what's that?
[122:59.59]Twitch chat.
[123:00.39]See you later.
[123:03.72]I didn't think this through because the way this sits, it sits like on top of the... I can't do it because the way that it sits, it sits on... There's a cord here.
[123:26.25]What if I do this?
[123:27.49]Are my pants on?
[123:28.23]Yes.
[123:33.62]Wait, wait, wait, I got an idea.
[123:35.24]Okay, so you guys, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, I got an idea.
[123:38.68]This might be pretty fun.
[123:40.36]You guys are gonna go on an adventure, you understand?
[123:42.24]Watch this, ready?
[123:44.66]I gotta fill this with water.
[123:49.78]So, as you can see in there, I mean, it's beer, but it's fine.
[123:53.84]Oh, that's like my fucking HD DVD.
[123:56.60]You guys know those, uh, those old, old school, hey, look, the person's gonna dive in the circus off the turnbuckle and into the water, right?
[124:06.23]That's gonna be you guys.
[124:07.93]Except you guys are going into like a quarter of a cider.
[124:11.73]Ready?
[124:13.07]So on the count of three, one.
[124:16.54]I think I'm going to fucking do that.
[124:18.94]I'm crazy.
[124:24.96]Let's go.
[124:27.38]I lost audio somehow.
[124:35.41]Alright, let me... Cyclops.
[124:41.05]Let's take a look.
[124:42.31]I want to go to the... No, I want to cook food.
[124:49.53]I have no balls.
[124:51.45]You can think that if you want, that's fine.
[124:53.89]I'm a 1 out of 10 streamer.
[124:57.61]I think I'm a 4 out of 10 streamer, at least.
[125:00.16]Give me at least half a credit here, please.
[125:04.86]I don't want these.
[125:05.46]I'm going to store the ion cubes.
[125:08.00]Let's go this way, right here.
[125:17.32]I need to repair this ship.
[125:18.54]It's kind of banged up.
[125:19.92]Let's make some cooked food.
[125:30.76]I did, you know, I did actually destroy my keyboard one time, you're right.
[125:35.19]Once or twice.
[125:35.63]Alright, that should be enough.
[125:40.37]I just want to, I want to just go observe the rotten...
[125:48.66]Okay, I have water in the tank there.
[125:50.26]I'm going to throw these down.
[125:54.13]Alright, let's put these back in here.
[125:59.65]I need both 100%.
[126:03.17]That's fine.
[126:03.73]Let's put the purple creature egg, lead, copper wire.
[126:09.16]I'm going to keep the gun just in case I need it.
[126:18.05]Explore some deeper biomes?
[126:19.31]Okay.
[126:19.91]We'll go do that.
[126:21.93]Let's go a little deeper.
[126:25.55]Let's repair.
[126:26.69]Do I have my repair gun?
[126:29.56]Yeah, I do.
[126:32.40]Let's go a little bit deeper.
[126:33.16]Let's explore a deeper biome.
[126:35.52]Let's repair the ship a little bit here.
[126:43.12]And I've got my food done.
[126:44.50]Let's... Wait, what the hell is this?
[126:47.02]Old?
[126:47.54]It's old, but... I think I still have water in here.
[126:53.37]No.
[126:53.69]Which one has the water?
[126:56.29]I'm gonna have to drink all of these.
[126:59.87]I am no longer thirsty.
[127:03.17]Good.
[127:03.85]Time to go.
[127:04.92]Let's go explore a little bit deeper.
[127:09.90]Now, by deeper, I mean let's go here, straight, and then down.
[127:15.10]55 power, that's okay.
[127:16.06]I have batteries.
[127:16.78]Oh, we have a wreckage here that I don't care about.
[127:25.79]I'm gonna go for a little... What the hell were you doing?
[127:34.39]I'm gonna go for a little while.
[127:35.53]We haven't really explored far out.
[127:41.35]We've gone down, but we haven't gone straight out.
[127:43.87]I feel like I want to do that for a little while.
[127:47.45]Just see what we get.
[127:51.60]See where we end up, you know?
[127:55.58]Save the game.
[127:56.64]That's a good idea.
[127:57.58]Thank you for the tip there.
[127:59.22]A little bit of wreckage.
[128:04.16]Let's explore this wreckage.
[128:05.40]We have not been out this far before.
[128:06.74]Might as well take a look.
[128:10.08]I don't have the mining equipment that I can use for this.
[128:12.75]Let's pick up the salvage for the titanium.
[128:16.41]What about down here?
[128:19.13]Just some salvage, it looks like.
[128:25.11]More salvage.
[128:25.97]I don't want that much salvage.
[128:27.39]Oh, we got these weird fucking spitters.
[128:30.70]Nothing else in here?
[128:31.38]That's it?
[128:32.88]Really?
[128:33.86]Okay.
[128:37.58]What about in here?
[128:42.18]Nope.
[128:43.94]Nothing.
[128:46.50]Scan.
[128:46.80]I already scanned those guys.
[128:48.64]I know what those guys are doing.
[128:49.52]I know what they like.
[128:50.32]I know their dislikes.
[128:54.17]Nothing else, right?
[129:00.07]Oh, by the way, you know I've been having a lot of nose hair troubles?
[129:03.19]Have I talked about this on stream?
[129:05.11]Probably not.
[129:06.67]But holy shit, man.
[129:08.83]Please somebody tell me that somebody else gets this too.
[129:12.27]I want someone else to feel my pain.
[129:15.83]So, like most human beings, right?
[129:18.01]Like, I mean, maybe not all of you guys, but I do.
[129:21.24]I try to keep my nose hairs kind of clean, right?
[129:24.54]I trim them, I get rid of the nose hairs, I make it so they're not long and disgusting, right?
[129:28.90]I try to take care of them.
[129:31.03]But more than three times now, and it happened like a few weeks ago, I have nose hairs where I cut them
[129:39.78]And I get ingrown nose hairs that start inside my nose and grow out through the front of my fucking face.
[129:48.77]They actually pierce the skin on the front of my nose and they come out.
[129:52.15]Has anybody else had that problem before?
[129:55.57]I use a nose hair trimmer.
[129:56.69]Yes, I use one of those CVS devices.
[130:02.44]From CVS, it's a nose hair cutter.
[130:05.28]And it grows through my nose and the hair comes out the front of my fucking nose.
[130:10.49]Has that happened to anybody else?
[130:18.21]No one.
[130:18.81]No one has had that happen before.
[130:20.20]Please.
[130:22.00]Somebody tell me I'm not insane.
[130:28.77]Stop cutting my nose hairs.
[130:30.05]I use one of those like devices you get at CVS.
[130:32.99]They're fucking patented from the FDA.
[130:37.79]That does happen to me.
[130:39.13]Okay.
[130:42.59]Where am I going?
[130:43.53]I've lost track.
[130:46.63]That's not a fake joke.
[130:47.71]I swear to God that happens and it's horrible.
[130:50.72]It's the most annoying thing ever.
[130:54.32]Play the game.
[130:54.90]Stop talking about your nose hairs.
[130:58.88]I am.
[130:59.58]We're 110 meters down.
[131:07.59]Alright, this looks different.
[131:08.89]I've not been down here before.
[131:16.03]What are these?
[131:17.53]Tree mushroom?
[131:20.33]Okay, well, I got a sample.
[131:21.40]Let's see what they do.
[131:22.20]Can I eat them?
[131:25.64]Nope, just flora scan them.
[131:33.67]There it is.
[131:34.17]Tree mushrooms.
[131:34.97]Okay.
[131:40.51]Ow.
[131:40.91]God damn it.
[131:43.43]Let's keep going down.
[131:46.07]Please save the game.
[131:47.05]I just did, didn't I?
[131:47.97]I thought I just saved it, like, less than five minutes ago.
[131:49.93]I'm getting deeper, though.
[131:57.10]I don't want to go that far down.
[131:58.38]I just want to go out.
[132:04.40]It's so cruel.
[132:05.24]I just have no regard for other lifeforms.
[132:12.85]A little bit further down here.
[132:13.89]That was a nice front flip.
[132:20.01]Alright.
[132:27.16]Let's go further down.
[132:28.54]A little bit further out.
[132:31.10]Now we're at the giant Epcot mushrooms.
[132:32.74]I remember these.
[132:37.10]I'm very good at driving.
[132:39.98]Yes, I am.
[132:43.14]Repair?
[132:43.84]I will.
[132:44.22]I'll get out in a second.
[132:44.94]I don't want to get caught up by anything.
[132:49.97]I want to keep going.
[132:59.96]How far away am I from the actual base?
[133:01.82]1200.
[133:01.84]I want to go like 1500 meters away.
[133:13.51]Have we reached the end?
[133:15.65]Is this the end?
[133:18.15]Maybe.
[133:24.98]I want to build a site.
[133:27.46]Hell, come on.
[133:28.16]Okay, well.
[133:33.18]Fifteen... I'm going to go... Alright, we're 1500 away.
[133:36.74]Is this going to kill me if I get out?
[133:45.02]No, we're fine.
[133:49.66]Can I even go down?
[133:50.76]Is it that big of a deal?
[133:51.76]How much damage?
[133:52.58]Does it actually do a lot of damage if I go down?
[133:54.16]Let's see.
[133:56.40]Yeah, it does.
[133:57.62]A lot.
[133:59.52]It does 10% per second.
[134:02.99]Dammit.
[134:08.79]Christ.
[134:10.25]Just get above sea level.
[134:12.33]Oh my god.
[134:25.33]Okay.
[134:26.41]That was less than 15 seconds.
[134:29.07]How far away am I?
[134:30.07]17, so there's still places to go.
[134:32.84]I wish I could go down.
[134:33.60]I mean, I don't think there's anything else I can do all the way out here.
[134:47.03]Why is the water gray?
[134:48.05]Because I need to go deeper.
[134:52.63]I'm trying just to find a new biome or something.
[134:54.67]Anything.
[134:57.08]I don't know where I am now, but I'm not... Dead zone.
[135:05.13]Okay, this is the... What on Earth is that?
[135:09.39]Oh my god!
[135:14.70]Oh, this is like the worm that's at the edge of the universe.
[135:18.24]Scan it?
[135:19.10]Should I scan it?
[135:20.78]I'm gonna scan it.
[135:21.40]Okay, here we go.
[135:22.72]I need to get this data, right?
[135:30.49]Why can't I scan him?
[135:33.13]I can't scan it?
[135:34.39]Okay, bye.
[135:48.36]See you later.
[135:50.56]That was fun.
[135:57.53]Nothing's wrong.
[135:58.31]Use the gun?
[135:59.55]I don't think I can fight that.
[136:04.29]We're fine.
[136:05.62]Alright, so, what, 2,000 meters is the farthest you can go?
[136:08.50]Or, like, 1,800?
[136:09.34]That was kind of scary.
[136:15.42]Alright.
[136:20.17]Use the gun to scan?
[136:21.33]What do you mean, use the gun?
[136:22.35]Use the gun, it freezes.
[136:23.33]I'm not going back there, are you serious?
[136:26.75]Yeah, go back there and fight the fucking giant end-of-the-world monster that is the... Quintessence!
[136:32.83]It's just... It's just the... Person, you are too far out.
[136:38.47]Please turn around.
[136:39.37]That's all it is.
[136:39.99]It's like the battlefield message.
[136:42.85]I'm not going back there.
[136:43.55]I do want to pick up this, though.
[136:47.89]Oh, fuck.
[136:52.59]Give me the gun.
[136:53.05]Give me the gun.
[136:54.49]I need to kill something here, right?
[136:55.51]Where's the gun?
[137:03.58]Did I get him?
[137:04.04]How many shots does it take to kill somebody?
[137:14.13]Um... I did it.
[137:25.49]What is the Messmer?
[137:28.45]Messmer.
[137:31.35]Messmer.
[137:32.53]Can I carve him?
[137:40.30]Where's the ship?
[137:43.22]Okay.
[137:44.24]These loud ass noises.
[137:58.03]I scanned him and I stabbed him.
[137:59.51]I have him in the database now.
[138:00.67]That's alright.
[138:01.57]Cave down here.
[138:07.95]Okay, we got some deposits.
[138:09.15]Let me take a look at what else is down here.
[138:14.12]Nothing.
[138:15.92]What is this?
[138:16.56]Lead?
[138:18.30]Lithium?
[138:19.00]Shit.
[138:19.44]Why can I not pick this shit up?
[138:22.59]That's so irritating.
[138:23.95]How do I get the thing to... Why does it want me to swim closer?
[138:26.93]Okay, it just bit me.
[138:27.63]Okay, that's cool.
[138:28.61]Hey, I can bite you too.
[138:31.13]I can't...
[138:54.23]You had nothing to do with it, but I'm going to hit you instead.
[138:56.93]Let's just get out of here.
[139:01.04]Cave system, that's fine.
[139:02.46]Let's just go over here.
[139:08.06]It's called a Messmer, but what do you think it does?
[139:09.84]I mean, I know what it does.
[139:12.66]It mesmerizes you into flying into them, and then you get bit.
[139:20.58]What is that?
[139:23.25]Is that some kind of rock?
[139:26.61]Ruby.
[139:27.23]Okay, that's new.
[139:28.03]I'll take that.
[139:32.91]This is cool though.
[139:33.71]Alright, where can I find the biggest monster in the game?
[139:38.12]I want to find like the... Can I pick that up?
[139:43.58]Shit.
[139:46.20]Back up.
[139:46.60]No, where's the up?
[139:47.26]Where is up?
[139:47.98]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[139:50.34]Okay, I'm fine.
[139:55.96]No shit, I want... Where's the repair tool?
[140:06.36]Freeze him?
[140:16.90]Alright, we got an alien cave system here.
[140:20.36]I think I just stumbled upon the alien cave.
[140:22.34]Get out of the way.
[140:27.32]Fuck out of the way.
[140:28.86]Oh, you asshole.
[140:29.88]Please move.
[140:34.30]What, I can walk around down here?
[140:37.94]Okay.
[140:39.21]I think I found something important.
[140:43.29]Why can he swim in here?
[140:44.39]This is like, clearly, there's no water in here!
[140:48.95]Get out of here!
[140:54.86]There's no water and a nice horn.
[140:58.02]You just press the horn down too hard.
[141:01.74]So instead of like, you got like, that happens to me all the time.
[141:07.96]I press the horn too hard.
[141:09.20]And instead of making a loud horn sound, I make like a, okay.
[141:17.51]So far so good.
[141:18.37]So far so cool.
[141:23.13]Can I have any food?
[141:26.80]No.
[141:26.96]I have to send a bug report.
[141:33.08]Yeah, the one time I should send a bug report, I'm not going to.
[141:35.78]It's nothing.
[141:40.13]Nothing else can be scanned.
[141:41.31]Oh, God.
[141:47.39]I'm not sending a bug report.
[141:48.69]They already know about that problem.
[141:54.69]Up here, there's probably gonna be one of those... What do I mean, maximum depth reached?
[142:00.52]Hull damage?
[142:01.34]There's no hull.
[142:02.08]It's just me.
[142:10.20]Nothing else I can scan.
[142:19.33]What do you mean, goodbye ship?
[142:22.96]Because I'm 300 meters down, it kills the ship.
[142:27.53]That seems a little unfair.
[142:43.38]Ship got moved.
[142:44.46]No, what do you mean ship got moved?
[142:48.16]The ship was at like 260.
[142:55.40]Don't even tell me.
[143:00.25]Can I at least get a sample of one of these?
[143:06.81]There's nothing I can even do in here.
[143:07.95]Okay, that's good.
[143:11.23]The shark pushed the ship and it blew up.
[143:15.17]The shark is currently right here.
[143:16.29]So I don't know what you mean by that.
[143:19.38]He's still hanging out here.
[143:25.46]Can I kill him while he's down here?
[143:28.32]The ship is right here, right?
[143:29.84]Like up here?
[143:42.42]He's dead.
[143:42.76]I already have him scanned.
[143:45.05]He's not dead.
[143:46.87]Where's the ship?
[143:53.15]The ship was under 300.
[143:53.97]The ship was right here.
[143:57.74]This is 297.
[144:02.24]297.
[144:02.74]It was not 300.
[144:03.70]It wasn't down here.
[144:04.64]It was right here.
[144:05.66]It was up here.
[144:06.20]296.
[144:11.56]Fucking damn it.
[144:12.30]Really?
[144:17.60]I gotta get out of here.
[144:18.46]I'm only 1600 meters away.
[144:21.05]Let me get a sample.
[144:27.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:34.66]Oxygen inside of the alien facility.
[144:39.96]Okay, we're fine.
[144:46.56]Okay, and three, two, one, go.
[144:55.19]Do I have to build another one of those things?
[144:59.62]No way I'm going to make it to the surface.
[145:01.02]Why would I not make it to the surface?
[145:02.40]Oh, shit.
[145:02.88]I have to go right to the surface.
[145:04.06]You're right.
[145:11.70]I think I just saw something in my field of view.
[145:13.62]That was actually kind of scary.
[145:16.16]Yeah, I'm fine.
[145:18.10]I'm just very far away.
[145:26.65]Ayayay, okay.
[145:29.93]Now we can't see anymore.
[145:33.99]This is actually spooky, and it is pretty spooky.
[145:48.84]This is masochistic, why?
[145:53.29]I'm just, like, dicking around in Subnautica.
[145:55.01]What's the matter?
[145:56.02]Don't swim towards the ship.
[145:57.20]Why wouldn't I swim towards the ship?
[145:58.42]I need a new one.
[146:04.82]No, we're not going to save scum.
[146:06.24]I'm just going to... I want to build the Cyclops.
[146:07.94]I need to find Cyclops pieces.
[146:09.60]It was going straight on.
[146:17.20]Oh, God.
[146:24.69]Is that one of those things?
[146:25.49]That is definitely one of those things.
[146:33.09]Careful left.
[146:34.17]Uh, careful left and careful right.
[146:35.53]Oh, fucking lord.
[146:45.72]I'm fine.
[146:50.90]I made it out alive.
[146:54.91]The ocean is terrifying, guys.
[146:56.25]This is why I don't go scuba diving.
[147:01.51]I think I already did scan the Reapers.
[147:05.98]I'm pretty sure I did.
[147:11.28]Oh, fuck.
[147:11.76]Go up.
[147:12.78]Don't even tell me I'm going to die here.
[147:17.47]I'm not going to die here.
[147:18.41]I'm fine.
[147:22.33]Seven Reapers spawn in the crash zone, Jesus.
[147:29.39]You mean no I didn't?
[147:30.27]Yes I did.
[147:32.07]I scanned a Reaper.
[147:41.03]My brain is so small, why don't I pay attention to the UI?
[147:44.51]I do!
[147:47.68]I'm not, I didn't die from drowning once this whole stream.
[147:51.22]What are you talking about?
[147:52.98]What are you talking about?
[147:53.94]I need food though.
[147:57.36]Give me this.
[148:00.81]Will you stop lagging?
[148:01.89]Oh my god.
[148:02.55]Why do you have to do that?
[148:03.35]No, I didn't.
[148:06.71]I didn't die once from drowning.
[148:11.39]I do want to check this guy's back.
[148:16.82]He's a lot of random shit sometimes.
[148:20.80]Let's take a look.
[148:25.96]We got gold.
[148:33.28]Anything else?
[148:34.06]Okay.
[148:35.30]Nope, nothing.
[148:36.80]See you later.
[148:37.44]That was fun.
[148:42.48]He died outside the alien ship.
[148:43.87]When?
[148:45.55]I don't recall.
[148:51.33]That's it for his back.
[148:54.13]One more.
[148:54.49]Alright, can we accomplish one thing on this stream?
[149:00.95]No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[149:02.93]That's not true.
[149:04.25]I did accomplish... I got to, like, the alien base.
[149:06.19]We saw the guy explode.
[149:08.05]We went in the alien base.
[149:09.34]I put the iPad in and we went inside.
[149:11.00]I accomplished that.
[149:11.80]That's fine.
[149:14.68]I still got one thing accomplished.
[149:25.84]A lack of oxygen will cause memory problems.
[149:28.60]Yeah, I'm aware.
[149:29.18]I don't want to load the save.
[149:32.14]I already blew it.
[149:32.90]I'm not going to be one of those people that loads and saves scums every time.
[149:36.38]Alright, what do I want to make?
[149:45.34]Let me just actually look at what I can even do.
[149:48.91]Okay.
[149:51.51]I need a Cyclops ingredient.
[149:56.31]A lot of... Okay, ultra-glide vent.
[149:57.89]These are easy.
[149:59.47]Lithium, two silicone rubber.
[150:00.74]I have lithium.
[150:05.20]Shut up.
[150:08.04]Didn't I pick up a lithium?
[150:10.14]I swear to God I did.
[150:12.43]Did I not?
[150:16.63]Oh.
[150:18.77]Now the upgrade module.
[150:19.97]You're right.
[150:20.70]Shit.
[150:23.66]I couldn't mine it.
[150:25.72]So how do I make the mining tool?
[150:28.78]Is there a specific thing I need to get the pickaxe or something?
[150:31.36]How do I get the mining tool?
[150:40.97]Laser cutter.
[150:41.63]I don't have that yet either.
[150:42.59]I'm going to go fragment hunting.
[150:50.43]Thermal plant.
[150:51.43]What's wrong with me?
[150:53.34]What the fuck is that?
[150:54.36]What am I looking at here?
[150:56.80]What am I looking at?
[150:58.36]What was that?
[151:08.17]Is it over here?
[151:09.29]What is this thing?
[151:16.31]What is this thing doing?
[151:17.13]Is this the thing that was just talking to me?
[151:29.36]Scan it yourself.
[151:29.98]What are you doing?
[151:37.16]That hurts.
[151:37.64]Okay, don't do that.
[151:38.34]That's an Easter egg.
[151:49.14]That's a story-related thing.
[151:51.06]Okay.
[151:52.45]So this is like an aliens thing.
[151:54.09]Aliens took over the world and...
[151:57.67]That shit's not just going to come over here, right?
[152:01.71]Take the gloves off.
[152:08.88]Okay.
[152:12.40]Save who?
[152:15.78]No, you're the alien.
[152:18.70]That's like every video game ever.
[152:20.22]You're the alien, you're the... Okay, purple tablet.
[152:22.30]I can make these now.
[152:27.13]I don't remember I'm making a scanner.
[152:28.35]Let's make some food!
[152:32.83]Do you remember?
[152:37.87]It's time for bed.
[152:38.71]You know, it actually is getting close.
[152:44.15]Making a base will help you progress.
[152:46.78]Yeah, I feel like that's true as well.
[152:48.36]I feel like I need to just make a base and actually have a thing.
[152:53.38]Um, I did get a rubies.
[152:55.90]Hmm.
[153:01.31]I am actually the alien, you're right.
[153:07.27]I can't stay up past my bedtime.
[153:09.26]Let's say, you know, while we have people here still, let's talk about the future of the stream here over the next few days.
[153:16.42]So I forgot that the Super Bowl is this weekend and the Patriots are playing and I live in New England and a bunch of people were like, hey, you're going to watch the Super Bowl?
[153:25.97]I was like, yeah, sure, I guess.
[153:28.39]And I'm like, ah, but I wanted to stream.
[153:30.67]So what we're going to do, I was going to go tomorrow, but I think I'd rather just have all the light gun stuff set up and ready to go on Monday.
[153:42.49]So we're going to do Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday of this coming week.
[153:49.08]I'm not going to stream the Super Bowl.
[153:50.58]Dude, if you stream the Super Bowl, you get sued.
[153:53.32]That's what happens to you.
[154:00.01]But that's the plan.
[154:04.63]Alright, let me... For the meantime, let's just start to put some things together here.
[154:09.91]I do have a lot of titanium.
[154:12.25]Let me just put it... Throw this shit away.
[154:14.17]Let's actually try to craft something.
[154:18.24]At least make some semblance of a base, right?
[154:22.66]Alright, so where was the base I was building...
[154:30.55]I might need to bring the fucking build tool, you dumbass.
[154:33.96]Would help.
[154:40.92]No, I don't want that.
[154:41.50]Where's the build tool?
[154:48.09]Put it over here?
[154:49.09]Alright, come on.
[154:51.65]Alright, let's go make something.
[154:53.45]Let's see what we need.
[154:58.74]So I need vertical connector, reinforcement, exterior base pieces, interior modules, wall locker, selenius.
[155:17.43]So how do I actually make a base?
[155:21.11]Hatch?
[155:22.49]So I need quartz and two tiles.
[155:23.97]Let me make like a hatch.
[155:26.56]Let's get some quartz.
[155:27.53]There's quartz in the locker down here.
[155:33.13]Not this one.
[155:33.69]I need the glass.
[155:38.93]I need quartz, too.
[155:40.09]Thank you.
[155:40.55]You just need a component and a hatch.
[155:48.10]Okay.
[155:49.68]I need water, too.
[155:50.66]God damn it.
[155:55.46]Yeah, I know.
[155:57.82]I'm aware.
[156:04.40]Please, just give me a guy that gives water.
[156:06.90]I gotta drink my gallon of water on stream.
[156:12.84]Mm-hmm.
[156:16.02]Oh, goddammit.
[156:16.78]Where is he?
[156:21.01]I need to build a hatch.
[156:24.11]Please.
[156:25.73]Where is one of those squeezy guys?
[156:31.58]There's one.
[156:33.02]Come here.
[156:33.32]Just give me, like, two or three of these.
[156:39.90]I'll be done.
[156:46.38]Come here.
[156:48.27]Come...
[156:53.31]Gary fish, a peeper.
[156:54.51]Let's go with one more.
[156:58.21]That should be enough water.
[157:00.13]I know.
[157:04.85]I know I don't have to get an oxygen.
[157:11.40]Scan yourself.
[157:12.16]Didn't I already do that, like, a few minutes ago?
[157:18.25]Let's make a water potion.
[157:21.21]That's right, I called it a water potion, it's fine.
[157:23.85]Don't worry about me, I'll be alright.
[157:29.75]My hands are really clammy?
[157:32.35]How did you know that?
[157:36.81]I need a multi-purpose room.
[157:45.98]You know, this does have VR support, you're right, it does.
[157:51.68]I feel like this game would be really intense in VR.
[157:53.66]Alright.
[158:00.56]Let's get back to what we were doing.
[158:05.85]So, where the hell... I already forgot.
[158:08.35]God damn it.
[158:11.75]It's like over here somewhere, right?
[158:13.93]I don't remember.
[158:14.65]That's why I can't play fucking games like these.
[158:19.11]I forgot already where I built that stupid initial base.
[158:21.75]I have no idea.
[158:22.87]Because like an hour and a half went by and we were just dicking around and talking shit.
[158:26.41]I don't even know where the hell it is.
[158:28.91]It's over here somewhere.
[158:31.03]It's right around here somewhere.
[158:37.94]In this circle.
[158:41.14]Please scan yourself.
[158:42.80]Why do I want to scan myself?
[158:45.90]No, I deconstructed the old one.
[158:51.32]There's still another one that's here.
[158:53.96]Scan the hands?
[158:54.96]If you can build a beacon... I can't build a beacon yet.
[159:01.83]I need to, like, discover how to build a beacon.
[159:07.09]I don't have the scan tool with me.
[159:10.57]Is it that important?
[159:13.27]Probably is.
[159:18.07]Let me just even see what the hell... Okay, I need a hatch...
[159:22.84]I need a multi-purpose room and a hatch.
[159:28.96]I don't even know what it is.
[159:30.01]I can't even build it.
[159:36.57]I don't even know what ingredients it takes to make a multi-purpose room.
[159:43.29]Alright, I'm gonna scan myself.
[159:44.65]I took the gloves off.
[159:45.57]I'll do the scan.
[159:54.50]What the fuck are you doing, game?
[159:59.73]Where's the scanner?
[160:04.03]Alright, scan my fucking hands.
[160:05.69]That's it?
[160:10.06]It didn't do anything!
[160:12.42]I'm scanned!
[160:15.50]Just use a tube.
[160:21.38]You guys are gonna make fun of me, but like because I have so much fucking trouble like even like doing anything Apparently like I need to just build the base right here So I'm gonna build a tube Right here and then a hatch and there's our house Hatch put it on There we go, okay hatch I'm going to my base
[160:52.66]I have zero power.
[160:53.76]Here's my room.
[160:54.57]This is my weird fifth element go to sleep room.
[161:02.63]Nice space.
[161:04.56]We're going to make it better.
[161:05.48]Don't worry.
[161:05.86]L compartment.
[161:06.90]Where can this go?
[161:13.54]Can this go anywhere else?
[161:14.51]Do I need a hatch everywhere?
[161:19.12]Hatch.
[161:19.62]No, I can't.
[161:20.62]Window.
[161:22.02]Look at that.
[161:23.44]Now we can see outside.
[161:24.26]Isn't that nice?
[161:26.73]In my tiny home.
[161:30.35]Uh, solar panels.
[161:33.23]Can I make them?
[161:36.93]So I need two quartz.
[161:43.03]Let's get two quartz.
[161:43.73]We're gonna stick a solar panel on top.
[161:46.63]This is awful.
[161:47.51]This is just a... I'm just the inside of a pill.
[161:52.81]Just a fucking Tylenol.
[161:55.43]Alright, I need two quartz.
[162:02.21]Don't forget what that is.
[162:07.76]I'm already out of oxygen.
[162:08.62]Are you serious?
[162:17.99]I want to see what the hell it even happens when you have a base.
[162:22.94]Just live like an astronaut.
[162:24.20]Here it is.
[162:24.56]See, I have lights in there.
[162:25.78]I'm fine.
[162:28.74]Just need two quartz.
[162:33.24]Find a little cave system and go in it.
[162:35.70]No cave over here.
[162:36.78]Just five frames a second.
[162:44.91]Further down.
[162:45.35]Give me a cave.
[162:50.85]Quartz.
[162:51.67]I need one more.
[162:55.81]There's the quartz.
[162:56.47]Let's just take a few of them just because.
[163:00.69]Just to have them.
[163:08.48]And there's another one.
[163:09.58]Just pick them up.
[163:10.60]Why not?
[163:12.82]Back to the base.
[163:13.94]Let's make a solar panel.
[163:21.70]I need healing again.
[163:23.45]Not healing, but water, you know.
[163:25.65]That thing.
[163:26.89]You're doing great, Jerma, with an asterisk and a bunch of laughing.
[163:30.57]Come on.
[163:37.20]Solar panel.
[163:37.86]Alright.
[163:43.70]Powers habitat oxygen generation in other habitat modules converts available sunlight into low power.
[163:50.81]Let's stick it somewhere.
[163:51.65]Where's it gonna go?
[163:54.99]Right here.
[163:58.03]Now I have oxygen in my house.
[164:02.77]Now I can breathe inside.
[164:03.95]Isn't that wonderful?
[164:09.46]No, I can't.
[164:11.02]Why?
[164:12.44]Why not?
[164:15.32]Why can I not breathe in here?
[164:20.59]Oh, because the sun needs to be out.
[164:25.11]What else can I do?
[164:27.51]Base attach pump.
[164:31.44]I don't know what this does.
[164:33.44]I'm going to put it here.
[164:34.16]Okay.
[164:36.92]Pumps oxygen from a powerful habitat to an attached pipe network.
[164:45.87]Let's put a radio in here.
[164:49.86]Let's go in.
[164:53.12]Radio.
[164:53.46]There we go.
[165:01.10]Nothing on the radio right now.
[165:03.25]Good to go.
[165:05.91]Wall locker.
[165:11.27]I can't do the aquarium yet.
[165:13.15]Locker.
[165:14.57]Fabricator.
[165:16.87]Ladder.
[165:17.74]No, I'm curious about that.
[165:24.84]Let's get out.
[165:27.60]I need power.
[165:28.22]We need it to be daytime.
[165:36.47]This is the first base I've ever built.
[165:38.15]Give me a break.
[165:40.27]I'm just... I'm learning how to make a base.
[165:45.47]L glass vertical connector.
[165:46.86]So what can I do with this?
[165:48.00]Can I actually put this anywhere?
[165:49.28]No, not yet.
[165:54.54]L compartment.
[165:55.48]How does this even work?
[165:57.36]I can't just stick it in here?
[165:59.18]Why?
[166:01.06]Doesn't work.
[166:05.30]Do I need another hatch?
[166:08.40]Alright, I have two hatches.
[166:14.48]No H2O, by the way.
[166:17.11]No, no, no.
[166:18.95]Construct it.
[166:21.65]The wall locker is blocking the way?
[166:25.27]There we go.
[166:27.59]We got power.
[166:29.69]Hold on.
[166:31.15]Okay.
[166:33.89]Let me take a look.
[166:44.26]Nice.
[166:44.86]We're good.
[166:45.14]I have to drink some water, but that's okay.
[166:49.38]I don't know what happened here.
[166:50.84]Didn't mean to do this.
[166:55.87]Alright.
[166:56.87]There we go.
[166:58.83]Oh, beautiful.
[167:00.23]Beautiful.
[167:03.15]Look at this.
[167:07.27]We're just... Now we're understanding what's going on.
[167:10.17]Now, how do you... I'm going to build a multi-purpose... Wait, what's this?
[167:15.87]I got to... I have enough solar panels.
[167:18.04]That's too base.
[167:19.96]It's alright.
[167:20.58]I need drinks.
[167:23.72]This is just the equivalent of having a den.
[167:27.16]This is my man cave.
[167:28.38]Here's my house, and I go downstairs to my basement.
[167:31.03]My finished basement.
[167:32.15]I just gotta put a TV down there and watch the Patriots tomorrow.
[167:34.69]Got a distress signal.
[167:42.58]Man cave, LOL, football.
[167:44.32]Wait, what's this?
[167:44.98]Pipe?
[167:48.02]I upgraded from a pill to a cigarette.
[167:49.88]Man cave.
[167:50.50]Haha.
[167:50.96]I don't actually mean that as a joke.
[167:53.24]Like, come on.
[167:57.75]What do you want?
[168:02.83]You gonna blow up too?
[168:03.55]What's... What's the goddamn game?
[168:19.94]Oh my god, it's gonna... Altered Beast.
[168:21.06]No, it's not.
[168:21.72]Is it Altered Beast?
[168:23.28]That sound effect?
[168:24.38]That person talking?
[168:26.14]Let's play Hammer Change!
[168:27.34]Make some more glass.
[168:50.07]Tools, I don't even know the flashlight.
[168:51.55]Alright, let me go back down to my man cave.
[168:54.35]Hashtag funny.
[168:58.17]I forget where it is.
[168:59.05]Oh, there it is.
[169:01.53]Alright, now what is this?
[169:07.40]What is this?
[169:08.70]I can attach this to here.
[169:10.30]Wow, wait a minute.
[169:13.78]What is this doing?
[169:19.39]This is my antenna to make sure I can pick up the Eagles game next week.
[169:24.00]I don't know what I did.
[169:25.98]We'll figure it out at some point.
[169:29.40]There's oxygen in here, we're good.
[169:34.78]Cool, I'm excited.
[169:36.88]Let's make another window.
[169:44.90]Sick!
[169:46.18]Wait, I need to drink again?
[169:49.93]I need to make a multi-purpose room for crying out loud.
[169:58.36]L glass compartment.
[169:59.26]I need one of these, but I don't know how to make it.
[170:03.57]I need my algae cleaner.
[170:05.55]What does this do?
[170:09.15]It's a ladder.
[170:11.13]How do I use this?
[170:19.48]I think that's all I can do.
[170:20.52]That's my basic base.
[170:22.04]What?
[170:22.28]I need a captain's chair.
[170:27.39]I can make a sign.
[170:27.95]Okay, good.
[170:28.93]Perfect.
[170:29.27]I need to make... I keep opening a tab for no reason.
[170:41.48]Here's a sign.
[170:42.10]Alright, what am I going to write?
[170:44.26]I'm going to write something really funny.
[170:52.95]Okay.
[170:56.57]Fuck.
[170:57.43]This has to be funny.
[171:13.34]There's not enough space.
[171:15.04]There's not enough space to keep honking and reloading.
[171:33.93]No, that's not even funny.
[171:42.11]Multiple signs?
[171:42.65]No, I don't want to waste material.
[172:01.96]I just saved a screenshot?
[172:05.87]Why am I saving screenshots to this?
[172:16.45]Put this in that funny montage.
[172:25.12]Alright.
[172:25.54]How do I end the stream?
[172:26.58]Let's find out.
[172:27.32]Let's go to... Let's go to a cave system.
[172:32.13]I need water.
[172:39.25]I'm going to go on a quick beer run.
[172:43.19]You know what I mean?
[172:43.65]Let's pick up some fucking booze for the game.
[172:48.23]Just need like five of these people.
[172:50.80]And some food.
[172:55.33]I'm going to try to find the other component.
[173:04.24]Hole fish?
[173:05.02]What the hell is that?
[173:06.74]Okay, I think that's going to be alright.
[173:09.73]Let's get two drinks.
[173:13.29]It's almost one o'clock in the morning time for bed.
[173:15.01]Yeah, you know, it is.
[173:17.31]The whole point of this stream was to do the meme funeral and we did it.
[173:22.57]I'll be back on Monday with, hopefully, some light gun shit.
[173:27.95]But I do want to do one more thing, though.
[173:29.51]I just want to try to do something.
[173:33.50]Just at least to have it.
[173:40.60]He did the meme?
[173:41.26]Yeah, I did the meme funeral.
[173:43.66]We did it.
[173:44.96]We had fun.
[173:52.29]I missed the meme funeral.
[173:53.33]Can you give me a recap?
[173:54.63]Uh, sure.
[173:57.17]They're all dead.
[173:59.49]That's pretty close to being accurate.
[174:04.37]Did I seriously just eat a rotten fucking dumb thing?
[174:06.89]Oh, whatever.
[174:07.57]Just go.
[174:08.09]Just get it.
[174:08.65]Just do it.
[174:10.55]Why is it still in my inventory?
[174:11.97]I don't know.
[174:21.21]Those are hard working on it.
[174:22.45]Somebody told me that they were, like, depressed from that meme stream.
[174:27.75]I, like, felt kind of bad about that.
[174:32.01]Somebody was like, dude, that, like, kind of depressed me.
[174:33.89]I'm just like, oh, shit.
[174:35.13]Fuck.
[174:36.35]I gotta feel bad now.
[174:39.99]Find.
[174:47.18]Looking for compartments.
[174:52.50]That was really depressing.
[174:56.96]Where am I going to find this dumb thing?
[174:58.90]I think I have to go this way.
[175:04.14]Any plans for an off-schedule Monster Hunter stream?
[175:06.55]Probably not in the next couple of days.
[175:11.09]I really do want to get started on the light gun stuff.
[175:13.73]And the Dreamcast stuff.
[175:16.23]So probably not anytime soon.
[175:20.01]I would expect maybe like next week.
[175:22.49]Depends on how much into the game I still am, you know?
[175:25.67]Alright, let's look for a compartment here.
[175:27.31]I need to find a module.
[175:32.03]Can I find one over here?
[175:35.69]Well, this is a bioreactor fragment.
[175:37.33]That looks pretty conspicuous.
[175:40.71]That's not what I'm looking for, though.
[175:47.94]Is this what I'm looking for over here?
[175:49.20]No.
[175:50.76]Salvage.
[175:51.26]There's the nuclear thing.
[175:56.18]We found that already.
[175:57.18]Damn it.
[176:02.59]I guess it's not over here.
[176:03.57]Oh!
[176:09.93]Up to the surface.
[176:10.61]Quick.
[176:13.55]Low rank is a big tutorial.
[176:14.63]Yeah, that's how I feel.
[176:26.26]Let's go.
[176:27.02]Somebody said it's near Lifepod 17.
[176:29.06]Is it really?
[176:29.90]What the fuck is this?
[176:34.90]What are these screenshots?
[176:41.68]When did I take these?
[176:44.94]Where is this?
[176:45.62]Okay, let's put on 17.
[176:48.71]Lifepod 17, a cave.
[176:54.86]I gotta go all the way over here, I guess.
[177:03.47]That's when I wrote the... I know, that's when those ones were taken, but before that, what was I looking at there?
[177:15.21]Underwater Firewatch.
[177:19.59]I've been to 17 twice now, but somebody told me that at 17 there is a cave system or something that I can find one of those compartments.
[177:27.57]I'm gonna try.
[177:29.13]And these genes are causing me a huge genital problem.
[177:35.43]General problem.
[177:44.50]I need 19 as well.
[177:48.03]And here we are, full circle with pod 17.
[177:58.96]And we're going to call the stream after this.
[178:01.44]It's that noisy.
[178:06.38]OK, looking for a cave here.
[178:13.81]That looks like a cave.
[178:15.87]But I need to breathe.
[178:17.31]I've been here four times.
[178:18.39]Yes, but I didn't go in the cave.
[178:20.43]Take off your jeans.
[178:22.41]Tide Pod 17.
[178:24.79]That's not even funny, and I'm laughing at it.
[178:26.93]Why?
[178:28.97]I think I'm just tired.
[178:33.74]This looks like a cave.
[178:34.64]Passing 100 meters.
[178:40.56]Oxygen efficiency decreased.
[178:43.12]Okay, I'm looking for a compartment down here.
[178:51.19]I've never seen this shit before, but I'm not gonna sca- I don't wanna run out of oxygen, this is a cave.
[178:58.47]That looks like a compartment!
[179:00.23]That looks compartment-y to me!
[179:03.59]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[179:04.96]Where is it?
[179:06.56]PDA?
[179:07.88]Oh, fuck.
[179:08.40]Okay.
[179:08.74]Okay.
[179:12.46]What is that?
[179:12.98]Is this a giant?
[179:14.56]Oh, no.
[179:16.68]Where's the... I gotta get out of here.
[179:19.72]Oh, god damn it.
[179:22.38]There's like eels.
[179:23.40]I gotta get out of here.
[179:24.02]Get me out.
[179:24.34]There's snakes in here.
[179:25.18]And my game is running so poorly.
[179:27.52]I'm gonna die in here.
[180:05.63]Now, I don't even... Stop it.
[180:07.93]Just escape.
[180:13.01]Alright, nah.
[180:13.69]I'm just tired.
[180:15.05]It's like 1 o'clock in the morning.
[180:16.21]I've been going to bed at like 11 recently.
[180:18.06]I have not died once this stream.
[180:20.38]You're right.
[180:20.78]I'm not dead yet.
[180:21.64]I'm still alive.
[180:28.15]I'm not lying.
[180:28.85]The compartment is in there.
[180:29.97]I'm going to stay in here.
[180:40.07]I just like come back and I'm crying.
[180:41.63]Alright.
[180:43.83]That's it.
[180:46.29]Thank you for joining me for the meme funeral and a little bit of Subnautica just kind of dicking around.
[180:55.27]Let's do some bits.
[180:57.95]There were a fucking lot of them.
[181:01.55]Holy shit, there were a lot of bits.
[181:04.74]Let's go over them right now.
[181:07.63]Take care, everybody.
[181:08.19]Thanks for sticking around.
[181:09.15]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[181:11.33]We're going to do some, hopefully, light gun stuff on Monday for real this time.
[181:15.13]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[181:19.64]The music is louder than me.
[181:20.70]Not anymore.
[181:21.66]I turned it down.
[181:24.46]Take care.
[181:26.04]Let's start with the bits.
[181:29.14]And... Let me close that out for a second.
[181:32.65]Hold on.
[181:35.63]Yeah, sorry we started so late.
[181:36.97]I would have gone for, like, probably another couple of hours, but... Meme funeral.
[181:41.87]Kind of took a little bit of precedence.
[181:45.01]But regardless, thank you so much to... Peoples, W for $1.
[181:48.65]I'm making a sleeping with the fishes joke, so SirJerma can't use it.
[181:53.38]I'm still gonna use it.

[182:10.48]I don't know.
[182:11.02]I'll do it whenever I feel like it.
[182:13.44]Thank you, Hasnain, for the $1.

[182:22.61]Jerma, I'm currently potty training my new dog, which I named after my favorite streamer.
[182:28.51]I find myself repeating over and over again, Jerma, just go.
[182:33.74]You pee pad training the dog?
[182:36.20]Or are you letting the dog outside?
[182:39.94]Build a base in or near the cave.
[182:41.52]That is a brilliant idea.
[182:42.84]How did I not know to do that?
[182:46.05]What a stupid fucking asshole I am.
[182:48.35]Thank you for the tip, though.
[182:49.09]I'm going to do that.
[182:51.31]Thank you, Bake Me Home, but thank you also to Lil Tip Top.

[183:09.98]But it was for the meme stream.
[183:12.63]I had to kill at least 150 memes on stream.
[183:18.29]What is the next stream going to look like?
[183:19.81]It should be Dreamcast or Lightgun.
[183:23.06]I have a bunch of stuff ordered.
[183:26.16]Old school light guns.
[183:27.18]And I'm not talking about the shitty ones.
[183:28.24]I'm talking about the real ones that actually has the hammer.
[183:31.42]That goes... When you shoot the gun.
[183:33.28]Those things are amazing.
[183:34.16]I love them.

[187:27.59]That can stay.
[187:28.37]I don't have the copyright infringement problem with that.

[206:07.49]I'm not sure what that's referring to, but I hope I did.
[206:11.62]Sam, we're gonna get a joke from Sam.
[206:13.52]Here we go.
[206:13.90]Here comes like a joke from Sam N, guys.
[206:16.09]Our resident mod, Sam N. Here comes like a funny fucking cringy joke.
[206:21.25]Here we go.
[206:22.77]Coffee is the silent victim in our house.
[206:26.24]It gets mugged every day.
[207:08.08]Apple Cooler, thanks for the $1.
[207:10.96]Go to the island again, then go up the hill and on top of the entrance to get the tablet.
[207:14.60]I think I already got, did I get the tablet?
[207:16.72]Thank you, Apple Cooler, for the tip.
[207:18.82]I may have gotten it.

[207:20.38]There's like three tablets.
[207:23.38]Pin, thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[207:24.94]Don't feel too bad about the meme funeral, guys.
[207:26.96]We always got shpee.
[207:31.16]I should have encompassed literally all years instead of just the last year.
[207:38.71]Oh, well.
[207:39.77]At least I got some of them.
[207:41.91]Apple Cooler, again for the $1.
[207:43.49]I couldn't find the like button, so I gave you actual hard-earned cash instead.
[207:47.94]Sorry for being such a disappointment.
[207:50.92]Disappointment?
[207:52.32]You're all my, like, godchildren.
[207:53.98]What are you talking about?
[207:55.96]Thank you.
[207:57.40]Thank you to Hydra725 for the $1.
[207:59.40]I ate... I ate... Late night.
[208:04.76]Jerma is the best.
[208:05.64]Nose cam, single eye cam.
[208:07.24]Oh, by the way,
[208:09.37]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[208:11.05]Thank you, Hydra.
[208:13.01]Hydra again gave a dollar here, and then it says pee-poo.
[208:16.94]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[208:18.82]Great.
[208:19.66]Good.
[208:20.48]Hydra again with a dollar.
[208:23.86]So you're telling me you bashed a seagull on your wall.
[208:26.44]If not, it means the meme is still alive.
[208:30.40]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[208:32.95]Hydra again with one dollar.
[208:34.49]How many bits for you to eat a Tide Pod?
[208:36.23]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[208:39.63]Hydra, again, with another dollar.
[208:41.95]Urine, urine, excrement, excrement, pee-pee, poo-poo.
[208:45.21]By the way, I'm adding these.
[208:46.67]He's not actually saying this.
[208:47.87]I'm just being a fucking weirdo.
[208:53.28]Viper.
[208:53.76]Thanks for the one dollar, Viper.
[208:55.46]Tide pods were the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden.
[209:01.22]I might just be really tired, but that's very funny.
[209:04.90]Stupid.
[209:05.72]What a stupid world we live in.
[209:07.38]Unbelievable.
[209:08.35]Unbelievable.
[209:11.82]They are.
[209:12.02]They have to be alive for Rat Movie 3.
[209:13.24]When that comes out.
[209:14.42]In, like, seven years.
[209:15.08]Well, they're problems with nose hairs.
[209:16.24]Thinking.
[209:41.07]Well, but you guys don't have nose hairs and you don't have long nose hairs.
[209:45.44]Just because we trim them doesn't mean they're not there.
[209:48.30]Come on.
[209:50.22]I had these nose hair issues when I was like 19.
[209:52.04]So that's not, that doesn't make no sense.
[209:54.48]Come on.
[209:56.88]Whirlybird, thanks for the $10.
[209:58.48]Jerma, I love you, but please never talk about ingrown hairs ever again.
[210:01.55]XOXO.
[210:05.01]Thank you, Whirlybird.
[210:07.81]Doomed RS.
[210:08.57]Thanks for the three bucks.
[210:09.64]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[210:10.58]Incoming MTV Cribs.
[210:15.02]Why can I not read that?
[210:15.80]I thought I was going to say crabs.
[210:18.15]Incoming MTV Cribs joke.
[210:21.71]No.
[210:22.65]Not tonight.
[210:24.23]I didn't have enough energy tonight after the meme funeral.
[210:27.69]Thank you so much for the $3.
[210:28.90]I appreciate it.
[210:30.34]Fiasco, thanks for the two bucks.
[210:32.24]A lot of people don't know this, Jeremy, but you don't actually need outside oxygen to breathe.
[210:36.78]Just stick two straws in your mouth and point them into your nostrils.
[210:41.24]You can use your own oxygen to breathe.
[210:50.60]That's funny.
[210:51.30]That's really funny.
[210:52.84]Thank you Fiasco for the $2.
[210:54.06]I'm just imagining somebody putting like two straws in their nose just like, oh man, this is gonna work.
[211:02.88]MooBeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[211:04.42]Is arriving just to the stream ending a channel meme?
[211:07.50]Thinking.
[211:09.21]Well, if you got here right when the channel ended, then that'd make you pretty late to the stream.
[211:14.79]So are you allowed to then give me shit for being late to the stream?
[211:19.37]If you were late?
[211:21.87]I'm always going to be late.
[211:24.61]Thinking, right?
[211:25.33]Thinking face.
[211:26.13]How do I do that on Twitch?
[211:29.00]It's like this, right?
[211:34.12]Does that work?
[211:35.96]No, it doesn't.
[211:36.90]It doesn't work.
[211:37.26]I don't know why I thought I had to add face there.
[211:41.52]Moo means moo again.
[211:42.24]Thanks for the $1.
[211:44.20]Tomorrow's the future.
[211:45.04]Today is now.
[211:45.72]Pee pee poo poo.
[211:46.56]Ha ha.
[211:47.46]Big wow.
[211:50.94]please don't make one of your first new memes in 2018 pee pee poo poo is that what you guys are going to go to because all your beloved jokes are gone now you're going to revert to pee pee poo poo Bob the pineapple thanks for the one dollar the meme police are aware of your crimes they'll be calling you tomorrow morning to ask you a few questions release the memes now or face the consequences
[212:16.74]If I released the memes right now, you'd just see a bunch of dead bodies would fall out of that bag.
[212:22.96]So, sorry.
[212:25.56]Alessa, Genova, thanks for the $5.
[212:27.88]Next is the only actually useful meme.
[212:31.03]I'm gonna miss it.
[212:34.73]Are you really gonna miss next?
[212:37.91]Dude, like, what?
[212:38.39]Okay, I'm gonna give you a scenario.
[212:40.19]So, next is spammed all the fucking time, right?
[212:44.31]So...
[212:45.81]Let's say I play a game that you really like and you really think that it would be fun for me to play on stream.
[212:52.01]So I get in the game and I'm checking out some stuff.
[212:54.87]I'm doing some settings.
[212:56.21]Okay, let's start the game.
[212:57.36]This is going to be fun.
[212:58.20]I can't wait to start this video game.
[213:00.76]Next!
[213:03.64]Eight minutes have gone by.
[213:07.24]No, I'm not gonna next after eight minutes.
[213:10.30]The reason why next is actually going away is because it was used to a point where I would be playing a game for like fucking 20 minutes and everybody would just be saying next.
[213:20.18]It's like, dude, there ain't nothing else next.
[213:22.08]This is what we're doing.
[213:23.20]You want next?
[213:23.98]Next would be my desktop would be what next would be.
[213:30.77]To give you a little bit of insight.
[213:34.25]I place it, no, next came from, I did the Christmas iPad stream.
[213:39.65]And it was say next, because I had like 50 games to play.
[213:47.40]Just go is the new next.
[213:48.80]Yeah, that's what you can, you can fall into new memes.
[213:53.28]But thank you, Alessia Genova, for the $5.
[213:54.84]Appreciate that.
[213:56.30]And the last five bits, six bits, because Weebles just came in with $1.
[214:00.72]Pee Pee Poo Poo is the evolution of Loud Pee.
[214:04.09]Yeah.
[214:04.97]They'll always be workarounds.
[214:09.52]GatorHD, thank you for the 25 cents.
[214:11.94]The invention of the shovel was groundbreaking.
[214:16.54]Yeah.
[214:18.90]It was.
[214:20.70]People used to shovel snow with their hands before the shovel.
[214:25.01]Cavemen were clearing out their driveways with their bare hands to park their cars.
[214:30.06]It's a good thing somebody came up with a rock that they smashed into a tube, which they then carved into a small cylinder that made a little divot to make a shovel.
[214:37.68]So, that is a pretty great invention.
[214:41.93]Abnormality, thanks for the $5.
[214:44.13]Hairs need to be talked about.
[214:45.61]Break free.
[214:48.45]Yes, they do.
[214:49.77]Somebody just ha-ha'd me.
[214:50.77]Why?
[214:51.05]Why?
[214:52.29]Is it just like a caveman joke?
[214:54.25]How is that a haha?
[214:55.65]Why did I get a haha for like a dumb caveman joke?
[215:03.29]I can understand why I get haha'd sometimes.
[215:05.31]But like for, I just said like the cavemen were digging up the driveways.
[215:08.82]That's enough to get a haha?
[215:11.34]What is it?
[215:11.64]What did I do?
[215:12.90]What did I do?
[215:20.51]Shovel breaks ground.
[215:21.61]Groundbreaking.
[215:25.49]I feel like you guys are overusing the ha-ha's on me a little bit here.
[215:30.42]Upset.
[215:31.06]I'm not upset.
[215:32.08]I'm very collected.
[215:34.82]But that is going to be it.

[216:55.57]Bye.
