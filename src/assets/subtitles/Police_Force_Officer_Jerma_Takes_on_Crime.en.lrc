[00:07.16]It's a tough day on the beat.
[00:12.04]We gotta go scan some civilians, make sure they're not getting into any trouble.
[00:16.02]And watch out, don't get stuck in a bush, partner.
[00:19.37]Yeah, there you go, good, good.
[00:20.55]Make sure, yeah, don't get stuck in any bushes.
[00:24.03]Gonna see if some asshole's causing any trouble over here.
[00:28.35]I need to find or identify the lost male resident of an old folks' home.
[00:34.94]That's it?
[00:36.12]That's all they're giving me?
[00:38.18]They don't give me, like, a mini-map thing?
[00:40.50]Oh, hey, just find this guy in this city.
[00:42.18]Good luck.
[00:44.36]Good.
[00:45.00]Fucking.
[00:45.44]Luck.
[00:47.80]What?
[00:48.42]Was this the guy?
[00:50.97]No.
[00:51.45]Oh, he's, like, drinking in public.
[00:53.59]Huh, his blood alcohol is 2.59?
[00:57.65]This guy should be in a coma right now.
[01:00.21]What the hell?
[01:00.69]He's punching me!
[01:03.67]Hit him with the Billy club!
[01:06.41]Did I kill him?
[01:09.75]Did I just- I think I just killed this guy.
[01:13.36]I'll be seeing you real quick.
[01:15.90]I'll be seeing you real soon.
[01:17.84]What the fuck?
[01:23.08]Sick U-turn!
[01:26.19]Somebody stole a briefcase in this area, and I gotta find him.
[01:30.69]Did you steal a briefcase, sir?
[01:33.33]No, I didn't steal the briefcase.
[01:34.69]Oh, good for you.
[01:36.27]What about you up here?
[01:38.35]This idiot that's walking in front of cars.
[01:40.03]Did you steal a briefcase?
[01:43.27]No, I didn't.
[01:43.97]I didn't steal a briefcase.
[01:44.83]Okay, cool.
[01:45.37]Good for you.
[01:45.79]What about this guy?
[01:48.71]What about this asshole?
[01:49.57]This guy's walking around like he's drunk.
[01:51.79]You steal the briefcase?
[01:54.38]Person is confused.
[01:58.56]Are you serious, dude?
[02:12.59]Okay!
[02:14.09]Uh... I think we need that ambulance again.
[02:22.08]Or a confused old man.
[02:23.70]So the two things we're looking for here is we're looking for a confused old man.
[02:28.56]Or a dude with a briefcase.
[02:32.38]That's very vague!
[02:34.88]I wish there was a minimap indicator of where I was even supposed to go!
[02:41.81]There's a guy with a briefcase!
[02:42.89]There's a guy with a briefcase!
[02:44.01]There's a guy with a briefcase!
[02:45.11]I found him!
[02:46.09]Get out of the car!
[02:47.52]Get out of the car!
[02:48.24]Get out of the car!
[02:48.94]Get out of the car!
[02:49.52]Come here, you motherfucker!
[02:50.44]It was, like, crashing!
[02:51.40]What's happening?
[02:52.94]My game just, like, crashed!
[02:55.88]What the fuck was that?
[02:56.80]Come here.
[02:58.72]Sir?
[02:59.50]I don't want to have to shoot you.
[03:01.40]I don't want to have to shoot you.
[03:02.56]Come here.
[03:03.86]You're under arrest.
[03:06.14]Put the briefcase down.
[03:08.57]Yeah.
[03:10.86]You dick.
[03:12.00]And you too.
[03:13.71]WHAAAT?
[03:15.59]What's- what's- what's happening?
[03:17.83]Dude, just seriously chill out.
[03:21.05]So I realized something about this game.
[03:23.79]What does she even do?
[03:25.05]What does my partner even do?
[03:28.59]My partner doesn't do anything.
[03:31.09]Every single time there's been a crime, or there's been an emergency call, she's just kinda hung out and walked around.
[03:37.69]This lady is on slash follow, like in Warcraft.
[03:42.85]What?
[03:44.41]You think that there would be some kind of lead?
[03:45.77]Wait, last saw her at the convenience store down on Oak Street.
[03:49.76]Like, no, there's no leads.
[03:53.28]All this says in the top left corner is, find this guy, he's lost forever.
[03:57.78]Like, there's gotta be some better description, man.
[04:03.86]I'm just looking, it's like the briefcase guy.
[04:07.05]I just got lucky.
[04:08.29]I turned the corner and there's a guy with a fucking briefcase looking at me.
[04:13.60]Is this game about, like, turning a corner and finding somebody in an alley?
[04:16.60]I mean, really.
[04:18.20]Where's the investigation?
[04:19.70]Where's the detective?
[04:21.86]Seems like the detective didn't do very much detective work.
[04:30.01]You're not really doing very much.
[04:32.31]You know what?
[04:32.67]Just stop.
[04:33.81]Enough.
[04:34.87]That's it.
[04:36.57]So I just found something in the game that's actually pretty interesting.
[04:40.15]The cars in the game, they are like dogs.
[04:43.89]Like, for instance, watch.
[04:44.93]I'm gonna call my car, and just like a goddamn dog... There it is!
[04:50.86]Come here, boy!
[04:51.48]Hey, look, there it is!
[04:55.32]Nobody's driving this.
[04:56.80]Watch this, ready?
[04:58.04]I'm gonna reiterate my point one more time.
[05:01.38]Over here, nobody in the car.
[05:03.94]Not a single person in that car.
[05:06.44]Yeah, hi, hi.
[05:07.36]How are you?
[05:11.30]I've totally arrested all these people for absolutely no reason.
[05:16.77]Nobody on this sidewalk has committed a crime.
[05:20.01]And this guy driving the paddy wagon doesn't seem to mind.
[05:22.63]How are you gonna fit all these people in there?
[05:26.17]You need another wagon.
[05:28.46]I'm gonna time-lapse this, because I don't think he can fit, like, these 20 people in this car.
[05:33.16]We're gonna find out.
[05:54.46]I didn't get to count.
[05:56.22]I don't know how many it took to completely make that card disappear, but it was apparently one too many.
