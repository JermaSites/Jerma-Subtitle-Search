[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.58]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.69]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:10.25]Well, here we go, round five.
[00:13.15]We all crashed again.
[00:14.57]You know it, so... Let's play some, uh... Crash is the new cool thing, you know?
[00:22.89]Yeah, if you don't crash when you're playing TF2, you're just... You're not trying hard, okay?
[00:27.97]You're not trying hard, no.
[00:28.73]A little effort, please.
[00:30.90]No.
[00:31.91]You need to run five background programs, TF2 music, livestream, and be cooking a sandwich to crash.
[00:39.33]And that takes a lot of effort.
[00:41.31]You just described my perfect woman.
[00:42.96]That's nice.
[00:43.96]Alright, here I come.
[00:49.36]Coming in now.
[00:51.30]Oh, there we go.
[00:53.82]I'm on red team.
[00:54.54]Where are you ladies at?
[00:56.62]I'm on blue.
[00:58.00]Alright, I'm a black guy.
[01:02.63]Why does it not let me spawn in?
[01:03.85]Oh, it's... Guys have already won.
[01:05.61]Oh, look at you with the flamethrower getting your pyro on.
[01:09.25]That's right.
[01:11.55]You're bad for the... Badlands, nice.
[01:16.12]Yeah, I'm definitely not gonna duel anyone because they'll probably just crash and I'll lose.
[01:20.46]Yo, come duel me, bro.
[01:22.12]Nope.
[01:23.32]Yo, let's duel.
[01:24.44]Let's touch pee-pees.
[01:25.32]Let's do it.
[01:27.50]What do you mean?
[01:28.44]That's the first time you've ever denied me pee-pee touching.
[01:32.31]Because it hurts my percentage of wins.
[01:36.55]And if it's below 90, then people are going to think I'm an up.
[01:40.65]Do you really have a percentage?
[01:41.87]Can you say it?
[01:42.94]Yeah, if you check your dual medal.
[01:45.32]Really?
[01:45.64]I didn't know there was a percentage.
[01:48.32]Mine must be like 40 or 30%.
[01:52.92]Reserve Shooter.
[01:54.10]Let's go with the scalp.
[01:55.74]Boy, bae.
[01:59.91]So, uh, this scout's wearing a beanie.
[02:03.23]He's a thug.
[02:03.89]I like it.
[02:05.95]Oh, the tassel cap?
[02:07.99]The water?
[02:08.51]I think that's what it's called.
[02:11.74]I don't know.
[02:12.28]Oh, God.
[02:17.20]Oh, my God.
[02:18.30]Mr. Pain in my ass.
[02:19.86]What kind of kill cam is that?
[02:21.14]I'm inside his face.
[02:22.02]I like that.
[02:24.98]Alright, let's go to the spire.
[02:27.22]No clipped right in his mouth.
[02:31.29]Oh my god, you guys are at the spawn.
[02:33.43]Oh, he's gonna kill me with his decal.
[02:35.07]Oh, son.
[02:37.13]Oh, I've never seen that.
[02:39.27]I've never seen somebody do that.
[02:40.24]The conscientious objector.
[02:45.20]So I could beat people down.
[02:47.08]This heavy fucking DJ is just being maxed out.
[02:49.96]This is annoying as shit.
[02:53.75]There's like two medics on this guy.
[02:55.25]Just running around invulnerable.
[02:57.71]Fatty McFatface.
[02:58.79]Ha ha.
[03:02.59]Hang on.
[03:03.37]I'm chasing this other Demoman.
[03:04.67]Black on black, where you at, bro?
[03:07.53]I'm going straight up heavy.
[03:08.73]Fuck nasty.
[03:09.55]You are so dark.
[03:11.01]When you touch yourself, it's like black on black crime.
[03:15.13]Yeah.
[03:16.91]Yeah.
[03:17.79]Come at me, bro.
[03:18.70]Let's go with some Tommy Slava action here.
[03:23.74]Oh, they're on our point.
[03:25.06]Oh, shh.
[03:26.26]I'm dead.
[03:28.28]Good.
[03:28.50]Yeah, we got to protect this point with our lines.
[03:30.56]Jerma had the drop on that one.
[03:32.56]yeah we work we were on it all for me we're good we're good we're good well there was a uh... now they get it we're gonna have you up in the uh... from top yeah I noticed so it's nice to get a few of them they're coming at me bro too hard
[04:02.28]We gotta push that second to last point.
[04:04.30]We're gonna get stuffed into our spawn in a minute here.
[04:06.72]There we go.
[04:12.54]What's good, baby girl?
[04:14.60]I was not aware you guys were pushed out that far.
[04:17.70]It's okay.
[04:18.18]I like to push it out a few times.
[04:20.11]No!
[04:21.11]That was close.
[04:22.33]Oh, there it is.
[04:23.83]No!
[04:24.61]No!
[04:25.91]No!
[04:26.97]No!
[04:29.02]Run away.
[04:30.96]Run for your life.
[04:31.78]Uh-oh.
[04:33.34]Uh-oh.
[04:35.21]Uh-oh.
[04:36.45]No, no, medic, medic, medic, medic, no, no.
[04:39.49]Okay.
[04:40.27]Thank God.
[04:41.15]Dripping that chocolate sauce.
[04:42.95]That chocolate sauce.
[04:44.89]Chocolate sauce.
[04:46.75]So, Jerma, when's the next, like, Scout in Real Life episode coming?
[04:50.45]Oh, it's funny you say that.
[04:52.05]It's funny you say that.
[04:54.65]Because that was hilarious.
[04:56.14]It's, uh...
[04:58.07]shooting for a really really huge deal in the next one I do so I'm going to be four five thousand and uh... I uh... hopefully people enjoy it because it's it's good it's taken a lot of time to make put a lot of put a lot of effort into this one noise all get on stand this dude's wearing a cool mask boxing clouds get like a
[05:23.96]These guys are unusual.
[05:25.46]A buzzard face hat thing on fire.
[05:30.46]Oh, son, Mr. Payne.
[05:33.14]Are we gonna get it?
[05:33.74]We're gonna get it.
[05:35.40]Nice cap.
[05:36.40]Why you switch teams, Payne?
[05:42.30]That's not fair.
[05:42.92]Oh, we gotta get him off the point.
[05:54.37]He's gonna get it.
[05:55.53]Got the fucking medic, that's all I care about.
[05:57.86]Wow, how do you not die paying?
[05:59.16]Tired of seeing these medics and heavies.
[06:01.18]So evil.
[06:02.10]The only thing that's killed me so far, I think I've been playing for like ten minutes now, and the only thing that's killed me is a heavy.
[06:06.46]With a medic on it.
[06:08.34]Damn parasites.
[06:11.31]Oh, can I get this point is the real question.
[06:13.25]Oh god, here comes stickies.
[06:16.37]No.
[06:21.75]Here, demo.
[06:23.46]No, Demo!
[06:24.36]Don't hurt the Demo!
[06:25.74]Oh.
[06:26.74]You whore.
[06:27.26]There it is.
[06:29.66]I'm coming for you.
[06:30.60]I like the customizing.
[06:31.80]You have like a pineapple face with a pink cap.
[06:35.48]That's Shibby's drinking partner.
[06:38.98]It's a win, bro.
[06:40.10]That's nice.
[06:41.54]You sure know how to accessorize, sister.
[06:43.18]Accessorize.
[06:44.70]You go, girl.
[06:46.46]Hello.
[06:51.67]Oh, poop.
[06:53.65]Wait, that's the best you came with was, oh, poop.
[06:57.39]Yeah, I mean, that's really what happened there.
[06:59.70]But I'd say the best part of this update is the double miscellaneous slots.
[07:03.24]That's definitely it.
[07:03.90]Yeah, that's awesome.
[07:06.28]So I can wear earbuds and glasses now and look like a boss.
[07:10.27]I love wearing the paper hat and the heavy luchador mask so I look like a scarecrow.
[07:18.49]It's painted orange, too.
[07:19.48]That's why you look like a scarecrow.
[07:21.34]They need to be able to craft the ability to be naked.
[07:26.44]Or like the tighty-whitey outfit.
[07:28.54]I'd rep that for days.
[07:30.40]Can you imagine a heavy in the tighty-whities?
[07:32.56]You know what I really want them to do, to be honest?
[07:34.79]I really want a heavy diaper miscellaneous.
[07:36.63]Like, for real.
[07:38.93]I think that would be the best addition to this game.
[07:40.47]Give him a diaper and put a binky in his mouth while he runs around with the fucking heavy.
[07:44.51]Yeah, like a diaper set.
[07:46.05]Like a diaper and a bonnet.
[07:48.59]And the miscellaneous could be the binky like you said.
[07:52.41]It would be so funny.
[07:54.31]I'd pay $10 for that.
[07:55.31]This guy didn't want to die so he wasted his Uber by... Jimmy!
[08:01.28]I would definitely pay money for that.
[08:05.06]You know I'm coming for you.
[08:05.86]I got your baby kicks.
[08:06.92]Alright.
[08:08.08]Oh, can't.
[08:08.78]No scope.
[08:10.08]Can't.
[08:10.38]No scope.
[08:10.88]Hang on.
[08:11.42]Hang on.
[08:11.86]Oh, no, no, no.
[08:13.42]I'm not black anymore.
[08:14.34]I pulled a Michael.
[08:15.46]Let's go.
[08:18.11]but he was a legend so amazing some as they in and out of the little boys are so amazing value upon right by me right where I want you that that simi is that you baby you know yes team up to take down double-teamed
[08:40.18]Wow, the bizarre bargain.
[08:41.46]That is one weapon I cannot use.
[08:43.66]Just... Straight up.
[08:45.63]You gotta be a natural, bro.
[08:47.17]You gotta be amazing.
[08:48.21]I'm just too much of a nub sniper in this game.
[08:50.01]I've got like four of those.
[08:51.11]I found two in a row earlier.
[08:53.68]I gave you one.
[08:55.04]I know, I still have that too.
[08:57.01]I'm really not that good with the sniper rifle.
[08:58.77]It's just like the way it looks.
[09:00.15]I like how the little magnification thing on the top.
[09:02.96]The red dot.
[09:04.12]It is pretty badass.
[09:05.32]I have to say.
[09:06.24]Hang on, I gotta... I gotta switch my... Oh, boy.
[09:09.66]My classy class.
[09:10.92]Trying to get my Reserve Shooter on you, son.
[09:13.34]Oh, God.
[09:14.78]I just got smashed in the face by the equalizer.
[09:18.52]Oh, my.
[09:19.20]Oh, my God.
[09:19.74]This guy spawned in my face.
[09:21.28]That was embarrassing.
[09:26.01]They got one guy on there?
[09:26.93]Is that Shibby on there?
[09:28.45]No.
[09:29.67]I got embarrassed.
[09:31.51]LOL.
[09:32.55]Yo!
[09:35.85]Oh, come on, Blue.
[09:36.52]Come on, Blue.
[09:38.18]There we go.
[09:39.96]Nice.
[09:42.94]Damn it!
[09:44.80]How dare you?
[09:45.56]I just got Widowmaker'd.
[09:46.84]See?
[09:47.62]He wouldn't have done it if you didn't put up that video, bitch.
[09:51.10]Oh, God.
[09:52.59]Hey, it's a legit combo now.
[09:54.43]Don't be hating.
[09:54.87]It's pretty nasty, I have to admit.
[09:56.03]I enjoy using it.
[09:57.65]But, I mean, your aim is too bad to use it, Pone.
[09:59.53]That's the problem.
[10:00.05]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[10:01.47]Oh, son.
[10:02.59]My aim is on point.
[10:04.20]You know what?
[10:04.50]Let's take this to Battlefield.
[10:07.18]Oh, my aim is good.
[10:08.24]Let's switch games.
[10:10.38]Okay.
[10:11.08]There we go.
[10:14.10]Getting healed by a professional noob.
[10:15.73]I got, like, five headshots in a row, but didn't kill one person.
[10:22.42]150 damage across the board to like five different people.
[10:26.12]Yes, where's my medic at?
[10:27.70]Spire, Spire.
[10:28.66]Let's take it.
[10:30.22]Oh, Mr. Payne's left.
[10:31.30]We have this now.
[10:32.00]It's over.
[10:33.34]GG.
[10:34.32]Really?
[10:34.62]Yep.
[10:37.08]There it is.
[10:39.46]No, no, no.
[10:40.30]There it is.
[10:40.96]What did I just get hit by?
[10:43.02]Oh, air shot.
[10:44.58]That was a nice air shot.
[10:46.57]I looked up and just saw that happen.
[10:48.95]Jumped right into it.
[10:50.29]I want to know how you survived that.
[10:51.57]Two to the face.
[10:52.39]Get out of here.
[10:55.53]Shoot, shoot, shoot.
[10:57.99]You cannot have my final point.
[11:00.49]I'm not losing again.
[11:01.39]You guys got Spire.
[11:07.53]Jerma, have you ever played any TF2 lobbies at all?
[11:10.41]Never.
[11:11.47]I've only done... I've seen people do it.
[11:14.41]Never done it myself.
[11:15.43]But...
[11:22.17]You have to kind of go to an in-browser program or something, right?
[11:26.89]Something like that.
[11:31.29]You have to put your code inside your Steam ID, and then... Something, something, something, and then you can play.
[11:37.56]I don't know.
[11:41.74]Yeah.
[11:42.80]There it is.
[11:43.94]Oh, yeah.
[11:44.78]That's a three-piece in a row right there.
[11:47.22]No biggie.
[11:50.32]Oh, yeah.
[11:50.78]Sniper, yeah.
[11:54.04]Coming for you medic bitch.
[11:58.70]Let's go take the last point son.
[12:03.72]Get out of here.
[12:08.76]I'm sitting on the last point right now.
[12:10.44]I know you guys are just going to roll in here.
[12:13.24]You got some shots here?
[12:15.14]What you got Jerma?
[12:16.68]Oh son!
[12:20.80]Oh, here we go.
[12:21.56]Here we go.
[12:22.05]I got... I found... Oh, DJ, you ate it all, bitch.
[12:26.59]I just... You got, like, eight medics over there.
[12:29.37]Seriously, how many medics do they have?
[12:31.05]We have two on blue.
[12:32.99]No, bullshit.
[12:33.81]I seen four.
[12:35.71]Well, definitely two.
[12:37.59]No, no.
[12:38.33]I demand a recount.
[12:41.49]It's rigged.
[12:42.64]I'm so afraid to leave this point, but I want to go do something.
[12:46.56]I know, like, a little scout will just come in and cap the damn thing.
[12:50.75]Oh, like you.
[12:51.33]Here he is.
[12:52.31]Oh, what?
[12:53.45]One shot?
[12:54.11]Are you serious?
[12:54.81]How?
[12:56.23]Get on the point.
[12:56.71]They're going to get it.
[13:00.41]Damn.
[13:01.49]He had the lock and load.
[13:02.77]I'm not sure if he got you.
[13:05.19]I'm pretty sure I had more than 100 health.
[13:08.42]Booping my cereal.
[13:13.10]Oh, God.
[13:14.70]Here we are.
[13:16.84]Serve shooter time.
[13:19.11]Oh, I'm lagging.
[13:20.25]It's going to make me scared.
[13:22.21]Oh, no.
[13:23.58]Heavy meta combo.
[13:24.50]I'm going to run away.
[13:25.68]Not yet.
[13:30.74]Mini-Sentry.
[13:31.52]Balls.
[13:32.38]There we go.
[13:32.82]I came back for you.
[13:33.84]Baltimore Ravens pooping on me.
[13:36.38]Oh, well, they do have a pretty badass defense.
[13:39.11]I'll put it out there.
[13:41.45]What's their record this year?
[13:42.39]I haven't really been following.
[13:43.37]It's probably not too solid, but at the same time, they got Ray Lewis, dude.
[13:48.39]Oh, they beat the Steelers.
[13:49.65]He's like the friendliest, the friendliest rapist in the world.
[13:54.88]He's a scary man.
[13:55.68]Oh-ho!
[13:56.96]You should know about the two-piece, bitch.
[14:00.64]Gotta get on, I gotta, we gotta get on that, that spire, man.
[14:04.14]We're getting pretty close.
[14:06.54]Oh, give me all the... Wow, there it is.
[14:08.36]Okay, Fox.
[14:09.88]Oh, come on, get this sentry away from me.
[14:12.48]Oh, just barely, I just barely turned the corner and I got killed by the compensation for lag.
[14:17.72]Ugh.
[14:18.83]I would have probably got on that point.
[14:20.17]Get the fuck out of here.
[14:27.84]I just got shit on by this brake dude.
[14:31.02]He's good.
[14:35.26]I didn't have much of a choice.
[14:36.26]I didn't think he was going to get to me.
[14:38.86]Guillermo with his cute little glasses on.
[14:43.25]I try to be fashionable.
[14:44.93]Damn it.
[14:45.83]I can't even get in your base.
[14:47.25]There's like a Pwnstar and a Jerma and heavy meta combo.
[14:53.77]We're trying to get up to the spire.
[14:57.19]Not happening.
[14:58.07]I just took out like three more guys.
[14:59.43]We gotta get in there.
[15:00.67]This decal tool thing.
[15:02.11]We need to get on that.
[15:03.33]Pound it in.
[15:04.15]Pound it in.
[15:05.77]The cool kid's got... Oh, there's a lot of stickies coming up my way.
[15:09.39]I'm gonna get smoked.
[15:11.55]Got you, Milky Joe.
[15:13.45]Oh, God.
[15:14.49]Wow.
[15:15.23]Is it all gone?
[15:17.27]There we go.
[15:18.21]Oh, here we go.
[15:19.75]Oh, stickies everywhere.
[15:21.67]I'm running.
[15:28.06]Damn you, sentry gun.
[15:33.84]Oh, let's get on it.
[15:34.38]That does not happen.
[15:35.30]Let's get on it.
[15:35.76]Let's go combat energy.
[15:40.44]Fucking hell.
[15:42.19]Yes.
[15:42.69]Oh, damn it.
[15:43.77]Ghosts was on the point.
[15:45.41]I turned it right into his face.
[15:46.47]Yeah, there were like fucking four guys there.
[15:48.29]I was trying to put it in.
[15:50.47]Oh, we have ghosts?
[15:51.17]That's GG, then.
[15:52.12]Mm-hmm.
[15:53.20]He's damn good.
[15:53.96]No, he's a beast.
