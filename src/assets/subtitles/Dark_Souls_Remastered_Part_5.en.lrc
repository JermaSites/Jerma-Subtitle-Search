[00:11.86]How have you been?
[00:17.12]Hopefully your day has been a swell one.
[00:22.32]You can just call me your neighbor.
[00:29.32]I don't want a fucking neighbor looking at me.
[00:34.33]welcome welcome welcome how you doing yeah Jeremy here welcome to uh a Sunday stream if you didn't know uh this stream is gonna be fairly short but we're gonna be not live for very long because I'm taking a trip to beautiful beautiful Las Vegas Nevada that's where I'm going
[01:00.16]Yeah, I'm going to Las Vegas to check out properties.
[01:04.43]So, I will not be live on Tuesday.
[01:09.49]If you're curious.
[01:13.67]I'm not going to be here.
[01:16.05]In fact, I might already not be here.
[01:20.35]Playing Dark Souls from my fucking phone.
[01:23.18]I'm playing Dark Souls from a laptop in my hotel room.
[01:26.40]Just for you guys.
[01:37.30]Vegas is a real place?
[01:38.32]Yes, it is.
[01:39.44]It's fairly real.
[01:46.47]Yes, because if you're still unaware, I am moving to Las Vegas.
[01:53.45]And this is part of the initial trip to find out where exactly that's going to be.
[01:57.21]Because I can't take it anymore out here.
[02:00.32]It's too much for me.
[02:04.29]Anyways, I'll see you guys in a minute.
[02:05.27]Let me just grab a quick little drink, and we'll sit down.
[02:42.11]Hey, I'm back.
[02:44.51]So let's quell some of these rumors here that I'm seeing in the chat.
[02:47.90]I'm seeing some rumors in the chat here that I need to... I don't know where you got these rumors from, but let me squish them.
[02:55.54]No, the stream is not going to be starting at 7 p.m.
[02:58.14]Pacific time when I'm in Las Vegas.
[02:59.64]We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes...
[03:13.76]That's too long.
[03:14.58]That's the only one I had available.
[03:21.32]That's Orson Welles complaining about how bad he thinks the script is for a shitty hamburger place.
[03:31.03]That's definitely... That's one time only.
[03:33.17]One day only.
[03:37.13]Anyways, let me dispel these rumors that I've been hearing if if and when I move to Las Vegas Streams will be starting at like 4 p.m.
[03:48.26]Eastern Or like 5 p.m.
[03:50.64]Eastern time.
[03:51.74]I'm not gonna start at 7 p.m.
[03:53.16]Pacific The streams are gonna be pulled back probably an hour or two Because if I start at 7 p.m.
[03:58.24]Pacific, it's like 11 o'clock.
[03:59.54]I
[04:00.90]We know a little place in the American far west.
[04:03.18]It's like 10 or 11 o'clock, Orson.
[04:04.63]Where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.
[04:09.61]This is a lot of shit, you know that?
[04:13.99]I mean, it is a lot of shit, but I'm trying to tell you.
[04:16.66]We're going to the American west.
[04:18.56]The finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.
[04:21.66]This is a lot of shit, you know that?
[04:26.02]I'm thinking because I'm moving to Nevada.
[04:29.05]You've got to have Orson Welles describe the area.
[04:35.13]But we're going to play Dark Souls just for a little bit.
[04:36.89]This stream's not going to be very long.
[04:40.91]We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes... This is a lot of shit, you know that?
[04:55.60]It's gonna pop up at the worst opportunity here.
[04:57.56]Alright, anyways.
[05:02.97]Here we go.
[05:03.35]I told myself never to do another long subsound.
[05:05.09]But today's a special day.
[05:05.69]We're going to the American Far West.
[05:25.89]Alright, um, so, again, bear with me.
[05:29.69]This is only going to be a... I think I need to cut it down to, this is a lot of shit, you know that.
[05:46.58]But, anyways, uh, not very long for a stream, maybe like two or three hours.
[05:51.01]I need to, I'm going to turn it off.
[05:54.63]I'm going to cut it down.
[05:57.36]We're gonna change it.
[05:59.10]Okay, I got an idea.
[06:02.03]We're gonna change it to this is a lot of shit.
[06:05.15]That's the new sub sound.
[06:09.61]So where the fuck was I going?
[06:11.77]I don't even remember.
[06:17.10]We did out here... I guess I could go to... I got the Lord Vessel.
[06:23.44]I'm trying to remember where we just were.
[06:24.98]I have a plus 10 butcher knife now.
[06:30.03]It needs to be longer?
[06:31.15]No, it can't be longer.
[06:32.57]I think I'm gonna go... There was a place I could go that was not...
[06:56.94]What about down at, uh... This is... I'm gonna have to turn it up.
[07:01.05]This is actually gonna cause problems.
[07:08.31]Uh... We got... Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[07:12.47]What about... I'm gonna go back here.
[07:14.66]I'm gonna go to Firelink because... Remember where I got the Zuiander.
[07:21.22]Slow it down to x2.
[07:22.18]That would be a mistake.
[07:26.97]I remember there was a spot.
[07:29.01]Out here.
[07:29.37]I can't even concentrate.
[07:30.93]What was I thinking?
[07:33.66]Again.
[07:34.08]What was I thinking?
[07:34.98]I can't have an 8 second subsound.
[07:36.30]What was I thinking?
[07:59.24]Uh, I gotta go where the graveyard was.
[08:01.53]Is this a spot to go?
[08:03.97]I know where I'm going.
[08:06.13]I know where I'm going.
[08:07.05]We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes... This is a lot of shit, you know.
[08:19.05]We need to go this way because from what I remember there's another place to go down here.
[08:41.07]We know a little place in the American far west.
[08:45.03]Now we're going to get a sub train.
[08:48.36]What a great sub strategy.
[08:50.24]Oh, we know a little place.
[08:55.72]I didn't even explore down here.
[09:02.09]There's still more to do.
[09:06.68]In like the hour-long time that you have here to listen to Orson Welles say the same line a hundred times tonight, I could probably kill another boss.
[09:16.65]I can't parry his speed.
[09:19.82]where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.
[09:24.81]This is a lot of shit, you know.
[09:28.09]We know a little place in the American far west... God damn it, man.
[09:31.81]...where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.
[09:36.78]This is a lot of shit, you know.
[09:42.82]I apologize in advance to all the people.
[09:44.54]I didn't have the binoculars.
[09:46.66]How have I played this game for like 17 hours and not have the binoculars?
[09:50.40]What does he do?
[09:52.33]What does Charlie Briggs do again?
[09:55.73]He does something with beef?
[10:06.68]winged spear okay these guys are so easy now that's a good thing those guys were unbearable before alright now we gotta go where was it over here yeah it's down here we know a little place in the American far west

[10:58.51]We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes it.

[11:21.81]I'll tell you the truth.
[11:22.61]Here's the truth, okay?
[11:23.45]Remember I told you I was going to change my sub sound or I was going to delete my Twitch channel?
[11:28.11]Oh, shit.
[11:30.41]Well, I woke up today at a late start.
[11:33.98]And apparently at some point I uploaded this clip.
[11:36.38]Like a year ago.
[11:41.20]And I'm looking at it going, oh my god, I have to put a sub sound on here or I have to delete my Twitch channel.
[11:46.22]I fell down.
[11:46.52]I didn't want to fall though.
[11:48.98]So this is the disaster called.
[11:51.14]I was panicking because I had no sub sound.
[11:52.92]This is a lot of shit.
[12:10.79]People are gonna come in here and they're gonna be like, I don't want to hear this anymore.
[12:14.46]This is not the intention for today's stream.
[12:32.43]I can't do anything.
[12:33.01]I'm not kidding.
[12:33.51]This is taking up 100% of my focus.
[12:34.83]I'm about to hit the panic button.
[12:58.40]Oh, my God.
[12:59.14]Okay.
[12:59.92]Alright.
[13:00.76]Alright.
[13:01.24]Alright.

[13:11.96]Where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes...
[13:29.14]It could be anything else.
[13:31.84]It could be me making a noise.

[13:38.13]I have to change it.
[13:39.91]I'm recording a line right now, and I'm uploading it to Streamlabs.

[16:31.78]Appreciate it.
[16:36.72]Boo.
[16:38.26]Look, I had to corral that.
[16:40.58]You understand?
[16:42.00]I had to corral that.
[16:43.24]I'm playing Dark Souls.
[16:44.78]I'm playing Dark Souls.
[16:46.77]So...
[16:48.38]I have to know.
[16:49.14]I have to, like, be able to concentrate.
[16:50.60]I can't hear, like, Orson Welles talk only the same line in my ear over and over again.
[16:57.77]Unsub.
[17:02.37]It was on.
[17:02.79]The stream's been live for 20 minutes.
[17:04.83]Come on.
[17:05.17]You had 20 minutes of the same dialogue piece.
[17:09.18]We learned something very important today.
[17:12.54]That I can't do that.
[17:16.95]I like this one.
[17:17.67]This one's like cute and funny.
[17:20.05]Don't you think this one's cute and funny?
[17:21.41]I need a new resub.
[17:25.35]Yeah, let's do a resub sound.
[17:27.44]I got one for you.
[17:32.42]There you go.
[17:36.90]This is your resub sound.
[17:38.40]We're like just fucking apes now, apparently.
[18:01.42]If there's a shitload of subs in a row, this is going to be worse than the thing we just had.
[18:06.30]Do you understand?
[18:07.26]It's going to be like a bunch of monkeys.
[18:10.22]This is going to be way worse.
[18:18.45]I'm going to have to go back to the awesome.
[18:21.37]What a disaster already.
[18:22.55]We haven't even started streaming.
[18:26.09]God damn it, man.
[18:27.43]Why do I like this?
[18:34.07]Hold on.
[18:34.53]Okay, resubs.
[18:40.92]Alert variations.
[18:41.94]Okay, resub.
[18:48.08]And it's right here.
[18:56.30]Where is it?
[18:56.76]I gotta save it.
[19:02.59]Right on the desktop.
[19:07.29]No, don't copy-paste of that shit.
[19:10.83]Don't you dare copy-paste of that stuff.
[19:16.39]Okay, we're good.
[19:17.45]Now I have my new sub sounds in there.
[19:20.05]Only for the next two days.
[19:25.05]Where is it?
[19:29.42]Oh my fucking god, I hate this already.
[19:32.20]It's done.
[19:33.44]There you go.
[19:40.24]I hate this already.
[19:42.84]I'm not happy about this change at all.
[19:46.80]Jesus fucking Christ.
[19:49.00]What a moron.
[19:51.52]Okay.
[19:52.96]So, now we can play Dark Souls.
[19:55.23]Just imagine there are the monsters in Dark Souls in the corner and stuff.
[20:02.39]Fucking God.
[20:05.71]Where was I?
[20:06.19]What was happening?
[20:06.81]Okay, I was down here in the depths.
[20:18.15]So these guys don't die, if I'm understanding this correctly.
[20:21.42]It looks like I can't kill these guys.
[20:22.86]They just forever respawn.
[20:27.94]At least they... I think that's what's happening.
[20:34.53]You like that move?
[20:36.05]It just saved my life.
[20:36.93]Alright, we're good.
[20:42.42]I have no... I gotta like restart this whole area.
[20:47.16]What the hell is this?
[20:47.92]Illusion?
[20:52.38]Nope.
[20:52.98]Place to go down here.
[20:59.20]Oh, there's a bonfire right here.
[21:03.54]Hopefully I get it and don't die.
[21:06.74]Oh my fucking god, they're everywhere.
[21:08.56]Touch it, touch it, can I do it?
[21:09.64]Oh, I have to kill them.
[21:13.28]Oh, fuck me.
[21:15.77]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[21:16.98]Why are you everywhere?
[21:20.34]Get up the hill!
[21:21.70]What are you doing?
[21:22.44]Get up the hill!
[21:23.08]Oh my fucking god!
[21:31.69]Why couldn't I just walk up that stupid little lump?
[21:43.82]Alright, let's get back to where we were.
[21:46.02]Let's just rekindle our brains here.
[21:48.44]I spent the first 30 minutes of the stream panicking.
[22:10.94]snort as a sub sound I I will eventually I think there's an easier way for me to go but whatever we're just going right to that bonfire I only have five Estus what what did I not oh god damn it whatever let's go well I ain't stopping I'm running there I'm not gonna stop at nothing
[22:42.51]Alright, that just- that sounds like a computer sending data over a telephone.
[22:48.21]Did my call just drop or is that a sub sound?
[22:53.86]Oh, I almost just fell off.
[22:54.64]Alright, honest to god, what's with this area and these little shit divots that you can't walk over?
[23:00.70]What the hell is that?
[23:11.14]We can climb down.
[23:19.47]Move.
[23:21.51]Move!
[23:24.69]Almost there.
[23:26.05]Right?
[23:26.45]Oh, right here.
[23:30.30]And there it is.
[23:32.22]Light the bonfire.
[23:33.30]Hooray!
[23:35.06]Wasn't there a person down here?
[23:43.04]That's such awful sub sounds by the way.
[23:45.42]It doesn't even matter though.
[23:46.62]It doesn't matter.
[23:48.80]I died so I have to rekindle.
[23:50.12]Let's take a double humanity.
[23:57.98]What's going on with your chat?
[23:59.78]I mean it's kind of a long story.
[24:07.21]Long story short.
[24:09.95]I had a sub sound that I stupidly put at the very beginning of the stream.
[24:22.10]And I turned it off.
[24:23.32]And you can never turn off anything that a chat likes, otherwise all of a sudden... I mean, you guys don't like that one?
[24:32.44]I think it speaks to us as friends and family members.
[24:41.72]I think I'm going to crush the iron golem.
[24:44.90]No.
[24:45.32]Put it back.
[24:45.76]You started it.
[24:47.76]I'm aware that I started it.
[24:48.92]Should I pull this?
[24:49.48]It's like a door to open or something?
[24:57.22]Okay.
[24:57.76]That looks like it must have opened an opening over here.
[25:05.03]Interesting.
[25:07.23]And now everyone just won't stop doing the sub sound.
[25:10.75]Okay, it was right here.
[25:16.62]And now we have an even better sub sound.
[25:18.96]Now we have a new king.
[25:22.24]Nothing over there, right?
[25:23.50]I guess there is something to do down there, but I don't want to fall.
[25:30.66]These remind me of the demon soul skeletons.
[25:33.94]And that's even more of a reason why I hate them.
[25:46.73]Put on the Rattus skull again.
[25:48.63]I forgot about the Rattus skull.
[25:49.85]Is that a boss room?
[25:52.21]Can I just drop down there right now?
[25:53.59]I'm going to look around first.
[25:55.46]I'm not ready.
[25:56.62]I'm not ready to leave yet.
[25:58.00]Okay.
[26:07.14]We can go that way.
[26:08.56]No, we're not going to get knocked off here.
[26:13.85]Okay, this is where it gets a little hairy because these guys don't die.
[26:16.09]Oh my fucking holy shit in my fucking pants.
[26:22.09]Right, so this is just... You gotta run through this area, huh?
[26:25.76]You can't stop.
[26:26.46]They're just spinning around and flying around.
[26:28.76]Okay, I got a Lushin.
[26:30.34]Oh my god.
[26:37.80]Oh, fuck.
[26:40.30]Oh my goodness, I hope I'm going the right way.
[26:47.41]Oh, come on.
[26:48.05]It's a dead end.
[26:48.83]Oh, shit.
[26:54.82]I'm dead.
[26:57.62]Like, what the fuck?
[26:59.06]You can't do anything here!
[27:03.64]You actually have to sprint through this whole level, don't you?
[27:06.80]Oh, this place sucks, asshole.
[27:08.00]Oh my god.
[27:12.50]Alright, duly noted.
[27:16.44]Just run and don't do anything else.
[27:30.27]That takes us up here.
[27:33.73]Is it a situation where if I backstab the fucking Gravekeeper everybody dies?
[27:38.01]No, I can't stop.
[27:43.31]I just said don't stop and you stopped.
[27:50.64]Left.
[27:51.46]Left again.
[27:51.92]There's an item right here.
[27:57.46]Large soul.
[27:58.48]No, don't stop!
[28:02.86]Oh my god, where the hell am I?
[28:03.96]Where am I going?
[28:07.76]I just went in a circle.
[28:08.82]Oh my god, they're alright here.
[28:10.90]There was a place to go down, right?
[28:12.68]Ow.
[28:13.30]You can go down there.
[28:21.09]I forgot my souls.
[28:22.11]Didn't I use them?
[28:24.63]Oh my fucking god.
[28:25.59]That's true.
[28:26.59]I thought I used them.
[28:27.53]I didn't.
[28:38.48]What was that scream?
[28:41.42]I don't remember where the hell I died.
[28:42.86]I didn't die in here.
[28:43.60]There it is.
[28:51.30]Okay, watch out.
[28:51.90]Make sure not to get locked in there.
[28:58.52]Get, get, get, get, get, get, get.
[28:59.56]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[29:01.95]Oh, you dumb statue.
[29:03.03]Okay, I could go this way, but I already was in here.
[29:07.27]Remember once I can go?
[29:08.91]I'm gonna have to drop down.
[29:19.27]Cheap Jerva?
[29:20.11]What do you mean, cheap Jerva?
[29:24.49]No, I need to be able to concentrate on Dark Souls.
[29:26.81]I can go down there.
[29:31.37]Although, I can.
[29:32.67]I really should put my armor back on.
[29:35.57]I can drop down there.
[29:41.59]This is dangerous, but it's worth a shot.
[29:44.61]Because I don't know what... I'm on spikes right now.
[29:59.21]Okay.
[30:00.35]So, you can't do that.
[30:04.37]So, I wonder what... Hmm.
[30:09.26]Well, let me go get those souls, if I even can.
[30:13.10]So, instead of going that way, I'm going to go down?
[30:16.40]I don't know.
[30:17.50]I guess I'm going to go down.
[30:18.24]Didn't look like I could go anywhere else.
[30:22.15]Did you really just sidestep me?
[30:26.05]I want to, like, kick them off.
[30:29.38]Did you hear the monkey?
[30:30.08]That means we got a new sub!
[30:36.09]Fucking assholes.
[30:41.93]So from here, I can't go down there.
[30:46.59]What about that way?
[30:54.00]I'm so lost.
[30:56.83]It looks like I can go across a bridge over there.
[30:58.81]Is this an illusion?
[31:03.68]No?
[31:04.36]Oh, I thought I went right through it.
[31:05.88]Oh well.
[31:15.90]You're dead.
[31:17.85]Nothing over here.
[31:18.57]Let me slowly make my way through this bot, because I feel like I'm missing something.
[31:31.17]I just got hit by every single... Oh my fucking god.
[31:35.17]You've got to be shitting me.
[31:38.69]Like, you're a dumb shit skeleton.
[31:41.07]I am so pissed off at this stupid fucking level.
[31:46.35]This place makes no sense.
[31:54.39]There's nothing else here.
[31:56.64]I have to jump off the cliff.
[32:19.16]No.
[32:24.04]Right.
[32:24.48]Okay.
[32:25.08]So, here we are again.
[32:28.89]I guess I can go that way.
[32:31.25]So that's the way we're going to go.
[32:33.15]I knew I was missing something.
[32:34.15]There's no way I'm walking around in a circle.
[32:36.75]There's just no way.
[32:43.21]No illusion.
[32:45.73]No.
[32:46.07]Alright.
[32:46.65]Out here.
[32:51.05]Too much bone hunting juice.
[32:53.87]This is going to be a little bit of a nightmare.
[32:56.33]Come on in here.
[32:57.57]All of you.
[32:58.24]This way.
[33:04.20]This is going to bounce me.
[33:05.46]It's going to be so bad.
[33:06.40]I'm going to get bounced.
[33:08.62]He's gonna shoot the... Good thing I was cautious and held out the shield.
[33:13.96]Can these things die?
[33:18.68]Whoa!
[33:22.40]I don't think those things can be killed.
[33:23.88]I think they have to just detonate.
[33:31.66]Apparently not.
[33:33.10]Well, we're fine.
[33:37.48]This is just Trap City again.
[33:39.14]I don't want to pull that yet because I don't know what it does.
[33:40.81]So I want to pick up this.
[33:43.47]Guys, is a snake going to come out of there?
[33:45.75]Centipede or a bug or something?
[33:51.01]Not quite.
[33:51.59]Okay.
[33:56.94]Let me guess.
[33:57.30]That's going to take the spikes down.
[34:00.00]Oh, look what that did.
[34:02.50]Look at what that did.
[34:04.52]Boys and girls.
[34:10.82]Is there an activator or is it just if you get too close?
[34:14.64]Did I beat Ornstein and Smough?
[34:16.58]I did.
[34:16.82]I did.
[34:28.10]I don't know if I... I don't trust this.
[34:30.82]I really don't.
[34:33.80]Something's going to happen here.
[34:37.54]Which one are you going to move first?
[34:38.64]And then someone's going to come behind me or something.
[34:40.28]That's how this game works.
[34:41.08]I know.
[34:41.40]Alright.
[34:46.96]Explode.
[34:48.19]Thank you.
[34:53.81]You too.
[34:57.83]Thank you.
[35:02.54]Doe.
[35:03.28]It's Smough.
[35:04.94]Not Smog like the dragon from Lord of the Rings.
[35:09.73]I like that we have smog sounds, though.
[35:12.37]Okay, hold on.
[35:14.96]Two places to go.
[35:15.72]Let's just check this area first.
[35:21.72]I knew it!
[35:23.28]No, what did I know?
[35:24.54]I didn't know anything.
[35:25.42]What does this do?
[35:27.45]Oh, shit.
[35:27.79]I can drop down there.
[35:31.47]Should I?
[35:36.09]I'm not sure what I want to do here.
[35:37.67]This looks like maybe you can fall in a secret and there's stuff there.
[35:44.05]Not yet.
[35:44.67]Hold on.
[35:45.03]Let me see where this takes me.
[35:48.16]This goes down in a spiral.
[35:54.26]Place to hide.
[35:54.96]Why are they giving me a little cranny to hide in?
[35:59.64]That's the real question.
[36:03.51]A little boulder is going to come down and swim through here.
[36:08.41]Ow.
[36:11.26]I need to put armor back on, first of all.
[36:13.12]Hold on.
[36:14.26]I'm walking around with a tablecloth.
[36:20.92]Blow up.
[36:21.91]Alright.
[36:25.51]Let's put that... What do I have on here?
[36:28.53]Not, not, not, not, not, not, not.
[36:34.59]I'm not even wearing a helmet.
[36:35.71]Alright, I was going to have on the gargoyle helm.
[36:41.05]Oh, you fucking little shit.
[36:42.21]Will you just get away from me?
[36:46.08]I need to put the bee back on.
[36:49.66]Where's the bee?
[36:52.40]There it is.
[36:52.90]This guy has a pretty terrible life here.
[36:57.99]He just keeps resurrecting to die.
[36:59.73]Although, I'm only at 29.
[37:09.75]Am I mid-rolling?
[37:10.93]Yeah, alright.
[37:11.29]I'm currently mid-rolling, so let's stop here with Havel's Gauntlets.
[37:20.90]That guy woke up to go, oh, yeah, it's time for me to die again.
[37:24.10]Time for my animation to play.
[37:30.34]What is this?
[37:31.99]No secrets.
[37:33.29]There's another way to go down, but there's an item, so I'm going to get it.
[37:36.81]What is that?
[37:37.17]Is there an NPC down here?
[37:42.46]NPC?
[37:42.76]No, it's just a candle.
[37:54.31]Who's spinning around?
[37:55.19]Oh, it's you.
[38:00.74]Oh my fucking Jesus.
[38:06.04]Okay.
[38:07.72]Only one way to go.
[38:09.50]A great stream, Jerma985.
[38:11.38]Thanks a lot, man.
[38:13.20]Appreciate it.
[38:16.03]Make sure you stick around.
[38:16.87]There's more zany actions.
[38:20.07]More wacky shit's gonna happen.
[38:23.05]Am I gonna, like, fall off the edge?
[38:24.27]I might!
[38:25.05]Oh, wait, what the f- He fell off the edge?
[38:28.79]And I'm gonna go- No!
[38:32.17]Remember that crazy subscriber thing that just happened?
[38:35.49]Nowhere else would you see something like that.
[38:37.15]That kind of content.
[38:44.55]I don't know what that did.
[38:45.79]But I'm sure it did something.
[38:48.30]I really want a shortcut.
[38:53.62]I can't go down there.
[38:57.30]Huh.
[39:00.10]Not yet.
[39:00.60]Not yet.
[39:01.14]I've just opened up a door.
[39:02.22]There might be a thing to press.
[39:11.60]I might have to go do something.
[39:12.62]It looks like right here.
[39:13.56]There it is.
[39:13.94]Okay.
[39:17.38]Anything here?
[39:20.67]This does not look like a... This doesn't look right.
[39:22.87]I think I have to move something else.
[39:36.53]I guess we're here.
[39:39.91]Ah, alright.
[39:40.67]This leads me to there.
[39:41.70]There's going to be another button to press.
[39:47.80]Remember, you've got to take their heads off so they can't come back as zombies, right?
[39:50.90]The rule.
[39:53.34]Oh, come on, please.
[39:54.50]What was that sound?
[39:59.74]Wasn't that just the, here comes an invader?
[40:05.79]There it is.
[40:06.67]Alright.
[40:07.21]Perfect.
[40:09.43]Now I have a shortcut from the bonfire.
[40:12.07]I can fall down there now.
[40:14.81]That looks good to me.
[40:17.88]That's the shortcut.
[40:20.38]Anything else?
[40:24.98]Literally blind.
[40:26.76]Actually blind.
[40:27.42]What are you talking about?
[40:30.34]I wanted to go... I don't care about accidentally getting a secret door.
[40:33.17]I needed to... I needed to go up there and activate the thing.
[40:35.93]And there's a bonfire here.
[40:43.07]I knew what I was doing, guys.
[40:44.54]Come on.
[40:56.37]I'm getting leveled up here.
[41:01.78]What do we got?
[41:02.32]I have a... This should take me there, I think, right?
[41:06.50]What was that sound?
[41:10.64]Yeah, well, I was curious of what the noise happened to be.
[41:17.07]I didn't know what it may or may not have been.
[41:19.53]Could have been anything.
[41:27.27]I should be able to get... Another vitality.
[41:30.21]Let's get the 30 vitality.
[41:34.40]Alright.
[41:35.76]Only five Estus, but I'm not going to Kindle this yet because I have a shortcut anyways, so... Shut up, stupid.
[41:44.00]If this is a boss, then it's a boss, and if it's not, then... If I die, I'm okay because I can literally just run and then drop from there.
[41:58.22]The sub sounds are too quiet.
[41:59.47]I'll turn them off.
[42:06.49]No boss.
[42:07.41]So... I guess we're going to keep that bonfire.
[42:15.91]Now don't ask me why this is here.
[42:19.57]Treasure.
[42:23.84]Who wrote that?
[42:24.90]I'm not even online.
[42:26.80]There's some random pretend online guy here.
[42:33.16]I mean, this is clearly fake.
[42:38.16]Even FromSoftware made it.
[42:39.68]They made this.
[42:40.46]They did this.
[42:41.04]I don't even need anybody to, like, fuck with me here.
[42:44.32]Why'd they do, like, a pretend fuck with you?
[42:49.20]That's a developer note.
[42:52.21]Well, let's see if I can get the treasure.
[42:58.03]I don't see any treasure.
[42:59.47]We're gonna keep going.
[43:05.51]This is a big guy.
[43:06.19]I guess there is treasure down here, huh?
[43:13.23]What is in it?
[43:15.39]Darkmoon Seance Ring.
[43:18.45]It wasn't a lie.
[43:19.01]There is treasure down here.
[43:21.43]Anything else?
[43:31.63]Well, I guess that's it.
[43:41.50]Nothing else.
[43:44.31]Just checking the walls.
[43:46.99]Actually worth it.
[43:47.55]I need to see what it even does.
[43:49.29]Can't really stop, though, here.
[43:53.89]Anything else?
[43:54.51]No, no, no, no, nothing.
[43:56.78]Here we go.
[43:57.30]Right here.
[43:57.60]Christ.
[44:02.24]Christ.
[44:15.21]Where's the boulder?
[44:15.89]I know it's coming.
[44:20.93]I'm hitting the fucking goddamn wall.
[44:26.84]These guys are fucking just relentless.
[44:29.02]When there's too many of them.
[44:30.92]These guys just overwhelm you so quickly.
[44:37.16]It makes me want to cry.
[44:40.74]Where is this?
[44:44.80]Am I actually going to have to rekindle that bonfire?
[44:51.72]Uh, well.
[44:53.66]This is leading me all the way down here.
[44:54.92]Like, I have no idea where the fuck I'm even going.
[45:07.25]I'm just walking in circles now.
[45:11.49]This is a giant room.
[45:14.67]With coffins and sarcophagi and... Nestle in coffin.
[45:26.71]There's a huge guy there.
[45:34.12]Is he gonna check the coffins and see if I'm dead?
[45:40.02]Am I doing this right?
[45:52.22]This is kind of freaking me out.
[45:53.76]What happens if I sit here?
[45:56.14]Is this the bird?
[45:56.76]Does the bird come over here and get me?
[46:01.08]Oh my god, it actually does something.
[46:15.62]What if I just get cremated?
[46:16.92]I just get a, you died.
[46:27.07]Where the fuck am I?
[46:36.08]Uh... Nowhere am I. Tomb of the Giants.
[46:51.70]Uh... Oh dear.
[46:59.30]I have no Estus.
[47:04.86]I gotta play this really cautiously.
[47:06.31]Until I find a bonfire to sit at.
[47:12.57]This place is weird.
[47:20.31]So this is where they bury the giants.
[47:22.45]Well, there's a giant in there.
[47:24.12]There's a guy in there.
[47:26.42]Right?
[47:26.62]There's a guy with a sword in there.
[47:29.77]Pray to the Sarcophagus Gravelord.
[47:35.54]Is that all I can do?
[47:36.24]Just want to check in anything else.
[47:41.30]Am I joining this guy's covenant?
[47:44.45]Is that what this is?
[48:00.39]I am now your... I will do your bidding.
[48:09.50]Gravelord's Sword.
[48:10.80]Offer Eye of Death.
[48:16.58]Hold on a second.
[48:24.58]Where was that?
[48:30.09]Oh damn.
[48:30.51]Oh shit.
[48:33.45]So this is the Nito sword.
[48:34.27]I do like that.
[49:00.15]What's... How can I not... What does it need?
[49:03.56]13 dexterity.
[49:05.64]Poison?
[49:11.05]Hmm.
[49:13.51]I like the moveset.
[49:17.43]Unfortunately, I can't really use it right now.
[49:20.99]So we're going to go back to what I was using before.
[49:24.18]I have it, though.
[49:26.29]Let's go back to this butcher knife.
[49:29.21]Alright, so how do I get out of here?
[49:35.92]Am I half?
[49:36.42]Should I offer him those crystal brain eyes, whatever they are?
[49:41.27]Not just poison, it's toxic.
[49:42.59]Oh, that's awesome, actually.
[49:43.59]Get back in the coffin and wait.
[49:53.14]Why did I stop using the ice cream?
[49:54.32]Because the ice cream is very hard to use here.
[49:56.02]Because it's little corridors and there's a bunch of skeletons and you have to run away.
[50:01.70]Oh, let's take a look at the ring.
[50:06.46]Ring of Sacrifice.
[50:07.66]Darkmoon.
[50:08.24]Grants additional tomb and slots.
[50:09.76]It's for casting.
[50:10.68]I don't use it.
[50:11.56]Don't need it.
[50:14.98]I'm going to offer it to him.
[50:16.14]Maybe he'll give me something else.
[50:18.86]When am I realistically going to come back here?
[50:23.74]Offer Eye of Death.
[50:27.56]Give him... I have one.
[50:32.65]Let me see what this thing even is before I do it.
[50:34.35]Is it a key?
[50:40.65]Is it a spell?
[50:41.89]Is it a sword?
[50:43.82]Is it a ring?
[50:45.58]Is it a piece of this?
[50:47.76]Is it an item?
[50:50.90]Crystal Eye Orb.
[50:51.82]Where is it?
[50:54.72]Crystal Eye Orb.
[50:55.80]There it is.
[50:57.89]Lore Phantoms from Other Worlds.
[50:59.19]I need 10.
[51:05.01]Nah, I'll just hold onto it then.
[51:08.09]It's not going to do anything.
[51:14.73]Back we go.
[51:17.45]I did get a cool weapon though, so that's cool.
[51:24.76]Eat that fucking key.
[51:31.15]So is he putting me?
[51:31.99]Is he taking me there?
[51:39.90]The question is, where the hell do I go from here?
[51:41.88]I kind of ran.
[51:57.85]There's a huge guy standing over here, too.
[51:59.85]I'm gonna go back and just take a look around.
[52:01.33]Because I don't have any... I'd have to use a humanity at that point.
[52:06.20]And I'm not sure I even really want to do that.
[52:09.26]So why would you use a humanity here?
[52:12.06]There's probably something.
[52:13.00]It's probably a secret grave.
[52:16.26]Secret door.
[52:18.53]There's probably something here.
[52:21.39]Like a bonfire or a shortcut.
[52:23.45]Okay.
[52:30.40]What are you seriously doing here?
[52:34.20]This is a large, so I can go down.
[52:35.68]I don't know where the fuck this is taking me.
[52:43.17]Oh, Lord.
[52:45.93]Shit.
[52:47.11]I guess we're just going this way still.
[52:54.52]The door to open?
[52:55.28]Is this going to bring me back up?
[52:58.21]Something?
[52:58.57]Anything?
[52:59.33]Wow, you shoot fast.
[53:00.43]You shoot really fast.
[53:11.90]Fucking Windows Update!
[53:32.44]I don't know where I'm going.
[53:33.08]I don't know where I'm going.
[53:34.70]Oh my god, where am I fucking going?
[53:37.48]There's these spinny guys now.
[53:39.08]No!
[53:39.86]No, no, no.
[53:40.52]No spinny guys.
[53:41.26]Not right now.
[53:42.02]Not the wheel people.
[53:44.26]Anything.
[53:45.21]Door.
[53:45.83]I gotta calm down.
[53:50.45]No, nothing over there.
[53:51.65]Get the fuck out of my way.
[53:56.33]They're everywhere.
[53:56.90]They're everywhere.
[53:58.98]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[54:02.84]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[54:06.20]They're everywhere.
[54:06.94]Okay, I get it.
[54:08.58]I get it.
[54:08.90]They're everywhere.
[54:09.56]I understand.
[54:10.24]Are they all around you currently?
[54:12.30]I wonder.
[54:13.08]Could you tell me again?
[54:16.21]What is this?
[54:42.97]Do I have to fall?
[54:44.61]I'm gonna lose health.
[54:45.35]Is this a boss?
[54:47.95]Oh my god, it's a fucking boss.
[54:54.52]I'm not ready for this.
[54:55.26]I have no Estus Flasks.
[55:11.63]God damn it.
[55:22.17]I gotta heal.
[55:22.67]I have to heal.
[55:24.88]What is he doing?
[55:27.48]I need to heal.
[55:27.94]I'm sorry.
[55:28.32]I have to use this.
[55:28.92]I have no idea what the fuck's going on.
[55:41.67]He like multiplies?
[55:50.64]He's gonna multiply like three times.
[55:51.96]Alright, now what?
[56:00.01]Now what, now what, now what?
[56:12.43]That's it?
[56:14.21]That's the boss?
[56:19.74]I thought I was gonna have to kill, like, five of them.
[56:25.52]By the right, I have kindling you, but now kindle beyond the normal limit.
[56:29.90]Okay.
[56:35.99]And I got the Mask of the Mother.
[56:37.41]That kind of does... That looks like a bug.
[56:39.93]Uh, so now, we're...
[56:48.77]I wonder if there's anything else I can do here.
[56:50.11]I mean, this is definitely a wall.
[56:51.83]Wait, what does that say?
[56:55.11]I just have, like, an option.
[56:56.13]Climb up.
[56:57.13]Oh, that's a ladder.
[56:58.27]Anything else in here?
[57:03.91]Yeah, first try, guys.
[57:04.91]That's, like, pretty good, I think.
[57:10.11]This boss was meant to be one of the first bosses.
[57:12.19]The devs kind of fucked it up.
[57:15.89]I could see that.
[57:18.24]That guy reminded me of a normal enemy.
[57:22.14]Without the teleporting, that dude is like a general enemy that you would see in a hallway.
[57:29.09]What was that?
[57:29.39]Three swings?
[57:30.21]Four swings to kill him?
[57:34.37]Something else up here?
[57:38.43]I just did that for no reason.
[57:49.54]I guess there's nothing there.
[57:52.46]I guess not?
[57:52.92]Okay.
[57:57.99]He is a normal enemy later in the game.
[58:02.67]One thing that I heard about the first Dark Souls, as wonderful and amazing as the game is, the thing... Oh, come on.
[58:10.60]The things I've heard about it are there are a couple of areas in the game that kind of just were rushed and weren't really done.
[58:16.96]And when there's some like people that weren't like high quality devs, like they were new in the company and they just made an area.
[58:27.13]I've heard there's a couple of places that are just like, well, this place is fucking weird.
[58:31.56]Shortcut ahead.
[58:34.16]Why are these here?
[58:39.34]Why does it say shortcut ahead?
[58:40.66]Why is it doing this?
[58:46.40]You know what I'm saying?
[58:47.22]I don't understand why the dev thing is there.
[58:52.81]Unless this is just, like, bullshit.
[58:59.69]They ran out of money and time.
[59:03.10]So this is just, like, a funny gotcha moment here.
[59:04.80]Okay.
[59:06.76]Although...
[59:10.64]What if I just died right there?
[59:11.50]That would be really bad.
[59:12.86]No, go back.
[59:22.66]Okay.
[59:25.42]It's a shame they couldn't finish the game properly.
[59:28.76]Yeah, just give it like... Hold on a minute.
[59:32.24]Where am I going?
[59:37.78]I don't like this place.
[59:40.21]Is there like a lantern I can equip?
[59:44.25]God damn it.
[59:51.03]Follow the Hansel and Gretel trail.
[59:56.04]Yeah, in like 10 years, don't worry guys, there'll be like a Dark Souls remake.
[60:01.82]In 1600p, whatever the fuck it is, 16,000p.
[60:05.90]Tomb of the Giants again.
[60:12.03]I really don't like the fact that I'm doing this with no Estus.
[60:16.75]And... What is that guy?!
[60:30.76]Fucking hell.
[60:31.44]I gotta have the shield up here.
[60:39.83]Oh no!
[60:41.56]I'm alive!
[60:42.38]Oh god damn it!
[60:43.80]What the fuck?
[60:53.65]That's so far away from here.
[60:55.95]That is so far away.
[61:00.65]That is like a thousand leagues away from here.
[61:06.59]There go all those souls that I just got.
[61:10.07]I'm going to be real with you guys.
[61:11.07]I have absolutely no idea how to get back there.
[61:14.34]Not even a single clue.
[61:20.96]You couldn't pay me to tell you where I needed to go.
[61:23.64]That was a mess of me running.
[61:26.12]I don't even fucking remember.
[61:27.12]I can't kindle this.
[61:37.08]Fuck me.
[61:51.41]Where was it?
[61:51.87]Over here?
[61:52.35]God, I don't even remember.
[61:54.69]I really don't.
[61:58.37]See ya.
[61:58.63]I think it's this way.
[62:00.49]I don't know.
[62:08.55]I don't remember.
[62:09.49]I don't remember.
[62:10.35]I don't remember!
[62:11.23]I don't remember!
[62:15.55]Every one of these rooms is the same room.
[62:18.27]All of them.
[62:20.70]I hate these little catacombs levels because they're the same level.
[62:23.84]It's the same place.
[62:25.72]Every room is the same room.
[62:27.17]I think I... Yeah, this is where I just was.
[62:44.33]This is literally the bonfire.
[62:48.52]Is it?
[62:51.26]Yes, this is the bonfire.
[62:52.32]At least this was here.
[62:53.08]I'm not gonna be able to navigate this.
[62:55.00]I'll have to come back here later or something, because I can't do this.
[63:01.11]Every fucking single room is a mudroom.
[63:03.33]With like the same arch on every single fucking corridor.
[63:06.13]There's all the same room.
[63:11.49]I'm gonna go this way.
[63:15.79]Can I like drop down here?
[63:18.04]I wonder if I can make this jump or something.
[63:21.37]Nope.
[63:21.65]See ya.
[63:23.45]Wait a minute.
[63:23.79]That was where... Hold on.
[63:24.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:25.91]Was that where I just died?
[63:26.81]Oh, God.
[63:30.55]I hate this place.
[63:35.10]And there go all the souls.
[63:35.84]Ah, who fucking gives a shit?
[63:42.38]Get me out of this dumb, worthless fucking zone.
[63:55.58]great side.
[63:56.30]I don't think I got that before.
[63:59.36]Okay.
[64:09.87]Keep going.
[64:10.39]Am I dead now if I fall?
[64:12.73]I can't tell how far that is.
[64:17.27]I'm going for it.
[64:19.41]I'm still alive.
[64:34.73]I have to go.
[64:36.70]What about right here?
[64:39.76]This is where all the guys are spinning around, right?
[64:41.68]Yep.
[64:45.50]I'm not going to... Just get me out of here.
[65:00.34]Is this... Okay, this is Pinwheel's zone.
[65:03.12]And then it's over there, and then climb up, and then here we go.
[65:11.70]He died to Pinwheel?
[65:12.74]I didn't die to Pinwheel!
[65:15.66]I didn't even get hit by Pinwheel.
[65:18.62]Well, he didn't hit me, but his big purple orb didn't.
[65:21.46]I consider that not to be taking real damage, you know what I mean?
[65:24.88]Alright.
[65:26.36]Here we go again.
[65:27.72]More of this dog shit.
[65:31.96]Just follow the- Fuck this place.
[65:53.75]Oh my god.
[65:54.39]Fuck this whole zone.
[66:00.63]Break.
[66:01.79]Give me a break.
[66:02.95]For real.
[66:03.65]Give me a break.
[66:19.98]Did I jump from here?
[66:20.82]I don't think I did.
[66:21.64]I think I went down another level.
[66:25.77]No, I went right here.
[66:32.24]Why are you doing pinwheel again?
[66:34.18]Because he's hard.
[66:35.60]He's like the hardest boss in the game.
[66:36.82]Don't you guys know that?
[66:47.62]You have to go so slow.
[66:48.28]There's a giant guy up here.
[66:49.76]Just get me to the bottom.
[66:51.10]I'm going to take it so slow.
[66:52.36]You don't even know how slow I'm going to go.
[66:56.70]It's going to be irritating how slow I do this.
[67:08.84]Yeah, I'm still stuck on Pinwheel.
[67:10.18]He's just... Something about his little area where he puts the fucking Jolly Ranchers on the ground.
[67:17.28]Something about it just sucks.
[67:19.36]Okay.
[67:20.32]Here we go.
[67:29.35]I thought that was in the game, and I actually thought I was gonna get hurt.
[67:36.29]Alright, this is where the...
[67:40.92]This is where the giant comes in, right?
[67:42.54]The big dude.
[67:45.60]Where is he?
[67:46.02]Where is he?
[67:47.06]I can see his eyes.
[67:47.84]Oh my god, don't fucking fall off.
[67:57.16]I just can't even see you, you fucking asshole.
[68:03.96]No dodging around.
[68:04.78]Really.
[68:07.43]Really.
[68:14.97]Okay, he's gone.
[68:16.25]Just hopefully there's not more than one of these guys.
[68:19.63]Slow.
[68:20.69]Very slow.
[68:21.88]Nowhere.
[68:28.00]Is that a drop?
[68:30.98]I can't tell if that's a drop or not.
[68:32.93]It looks like one, doesn't it?
[68:36.41]I can see the shit falling down.
[68:37.93]I can see it falling.
[68:44.26]man I can't even tell okay I see I see a crunch berry over here okay this this one over to that no don't even I don't care what about straight ahead there's a guy where's this guy underneath me that looks safe
[69:12.54]What in the name of God just happened?
[69:14.04]I slid on, I slid.
[69:15.88]I slid.
[69:18.59]I don't know where to go from here.
[69:22.31]Where's the next one?
[69:24.49]Over there?
[69:24.99]I don't understand where to go.
[69:29.87]I don't understand.
[69:33.80]There's no more of them.
[69:39.52]Oh my God, I'm sliding again.
[69:41.72]There's a guy right next to me.
[69:42.50]There's a guy right next to me.
[69:43.74]There's a guy shooting arrows.
[69:46.40]Where's the guy shooting the fucking arrows?
[69:56.67]You don't understand.
[69:57.23]This is not possible for me to know where to go here.
[70:00.39]I don't understand.
[70:06.83]Is there more than one of these guys?
[70:08.39]They can stand over here.
[70:15.70]Oh my fucking god!
[70:16.62]Oh my fucking god!
[70:18.44]Is he alive?
[70:18.96]He's dead.
[70:21.89]Fuck you!
[70:23.99]Oh my god, I can't see!
[70:34.34]Slide?
[70:34.82]Is this another slide?
[70:36.56]I think it's another slide.
[70:43.97]I hate this.
[70:45.21]I... I hate this place.
[70:48.27]I don't like this at all.
[70:49.59]Nothing about this.
[70:54.91]Who the fuck are you?
[70:55.71]Uh, this is patch... This is patchwork.
[71:01.59]I gotta make sure I, uh...
[71:14.84]Am I a cleric?
[71:16.68]I should probably just tell him yes.
[71:22.32]No, I'm going to be truthful to him, I think.
[71:24.04]Or should I just kick him off?
[71:30.17]I don't want this guy to fucking do anything because this guy in every game does something really bad.
[71:34.07]So I'm going to kick him off the edge.
[71:37.67]I don't get time for this shit.
[71:42.01]Yeah, I'm a cleric.
[71:43.29]Yes, I guessed as much.
[71:45.33]Well, here's the thing.
[71:47.19]There's a stash of treasure right down that hole.
[71:50.15]I found it first, but well, you're the cleric, right?
[71:53.80]I owe you for all that praying and whatnot.
[71:58.58]I'll give you first pick.
[72:00.48]Well, go on.
[72:01.82]Have a look.
[72:03.60]It'll shimmer you blind.
[72:17.27]Which hole?
[72:20.95]Oh, that hole?
[72:22.22]You mean the one that I'm about to kick you in?
[72:27.40]Punk.
[72:28.84]Fuck you.
[72:33.57]What happened?
[72:36.85]What's going on?
[72:41.81]No, I just did that to you.
[72:44.40]I just did that to him.
[72:46.44]Why would he be able to do that to me?
[72:47.98]Oh my god.
[72:49.94]Give me a fucking break.
[72:54.46]Give me a fucking break.
[72:56.98]You got up here quick.
[73:00.36]Okay, so now there's two of them.
[73:13.53]What the fuck is even down here?
[73:17.78]You hear that?
[73:20.44]Oh, fuck.
[73:33.15]God.
[73:33.23]Damn it.
[73:39.47]Where is he?
[73:42.50]There's some kind of animal down here.
[74:00.95]That was it.
[74:01.94]That was fucking monkey sound.
[74:03.84]Okay.
[74:09.66]Okay.
[74:16.50]So how do I get out of here?
[74:20.40]I just picked up something, hold on.
[74:25.76]I just picked up a lantern.
[74:30.88]Okay, equip it.
[74:33.48]How do I like turn it on?
[74:35.04]What's the on button?
[74:38.48]There's no on button?
[74:43.75]How do I use it?
[74:53.80]Skull lantern.
[75:06.14]Is that doing something?
[75:07.00]I can't even tell if that's doing anything.
[75:08.28]Oh, shit.
[75:22.79]There's somebody down here.
[75:27.17]You're no hollow, are you?
[75:29.61]Thank goodness.
[75:30.87]Please be careful.
[75:32.71]There are two fierce hollows not far from here.
[75:35.21]You're like a shield.
[75:38.19]My former escort.
[75:41.17]Hold on, hold on!
[75:46.23]I almost just punched this lady.
[75:52.93]Oh my god.
[75:53.69]Okay, well, sorry.
[75:54.85]Sorry I didn't know that holding up the fucking...
[75:58.47]Guy from... I can't even... Scorpion from the fucking Mortal Kombat game.
[76:08.75]Okay, there's people down here.
[76:16.24]I'm glad actually... Okay, so let me look.
[76:18.60]What do we got?
[76:22.54]There was a monster in here at one point.
[76:27.92]There were more than one monster in here.
[76:29.80]I'm so glad I can see.
[76:30.96]I can go back up.
[76:34.81]No, I can't.
[76:35.59]It's just up here.
[76:38.01]Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!
[76:40.93]Hello, hello, hello!
[76:44.95]Hello!
[76:47.76]These things take a lot of damage, hello!
[76:57.40]Alright, fuck them.
[76:58.24]Just leave.
[77:01.67]Is she gonna be alright?
[77:02.31]You gonna be okay?
[77:09.35]Where is that exactly are you talking about?
[77:10.97]There's a guy!
[77:11.51]There's a guy!
[77:11.99]There's a guy!
[77:12.41]There's two guys!
[77:14.40]Can I parry with the... Can I parry with the scorpion head?
[77:19.54]Oh, fuck me.
[77:22.08]Oh my god, this is bad news.
[77:23.28]This is very bad news.
[77:25.44]This is something you don't want to see every day.
[77:28.88]I gotta run.
[77:29.56]We're going.
[77:31.31]Goodbye.
[77:34.15]They're behind me, right?
[77:34.71]They're still behind me?
[77:35.97]They're right behind me, aren't they?
[77:36.75]They're right behind me.
[77:41.55]I can hear them breathing.
[77:48.42]I can't go by it!
[77:49.02]I can't go by it!
[78:01.19]Oh fuck this is horrible I can't do this I'm stuck This is fucking terrible I'm gonna fall off a fucking cliff
[78:29.83]Fucking god, fuck this place.
[78:35.33]One down.
[78:47.56]Fuck outta here.
[78:48.14]Okay, I'm alright.
[78:52.43]I'm gonna take a humanity.
[79:02.96]Jesus Christ.
[79:09.86]Where was that lady?
[79:14.02]You banished those two hollows, did you?
[79:16.76]It pains me to think of the trouble my failings have caused.
[79:20.56]I am certain that both Vince and Nico are grateful to you.
[79:24.70]Thank you so very much, dear.
[79:26.16]I two-shot them?
[79:26.82]Why am I so scared?
[79:27.66]Because I can't see anything and I have no Estus.
[79:30.74]You deserve them more than I.
[79:33.84]Replenishment.
[79:34.88]Well, thanks for the spell.
[79:38.46]You're welcome.
[79:39.04]Okay.
[79:39.56]What the fuck?
[79:46.06]No, you stupid fucking idiot.
[79:47.44]You dumb motherfucker.
[79:50.32]She said they just killed her.
[79:51.56]Fuck.
[79:52.74]I hope I didn't need that.
[79:53.64]Did she drop something?
[79:54.76]Does she have an item that she drops?
[79:56.80]She might drop like a point or something.
[79:58.21]Give it to me.
[79:59.23]Seven humanity.
[79:59.99]Seven humanity.
[80:05.16]I didn't do it.
[80:05.98]It wasn't me.
[80:06.58]I didn't do anything.
[80:12.80]Shit.
[80:13.60]Okay, I gotta kill this one.
[80:16.34]And then please get me to, like, a bonfire.
[80:24.54]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[80:27.89]How are you alive?
[80:28.63]Do that again.
[80:37.83]The body was still warm.
[80:40.62]What am I supposed to do about it?
[80:41.68]Yikes.
[80:53.64]One more, that's it.
[81:00.57]Okay, get me out of this nightmare.
[81:05.34]Is there any more shit?
[81:06.28]Or is there a bonfire?
[81:09.08]Oh.
[81:10.56]A ladder.
[81:16.72]I didn't do that.
[81:17.46]That's not my doing.
[81:18.42]I just got some... I got an item, too.
[81:20.31]Some talisman?
[81:26.43]Okay.
[81:28.09]For the love of God.
[81:38.01]There's a way to go down here.
[81:48.64]Is this a shortcut?
[81:51.16]I hope it is.
[81:57.86]Shortcut?
[81:58.48]Right.
[81:59.02]It's gotta be.
[82:02.06]Oh, no.
[82:03.20]Oh, no.
[82:04.00]Can he climb a ladder?
[82:05.66]Is he climbing a ladder on me?
[82:07.80]He can't climb ladders.
[82:08.86]He's too big.
[82:15.53]Look how many people are down there.
[82:18.71]This is the three giants.
[82:24.53]This is bad news.
[82:25.53]I can't... No, I'm not going down there.
[82:31.75]So over here then.
[82:35.67]I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[82:38.93]Hopefully I run into something.
[82:41.84]This is tight.
[82:48.10]Oh, this is where I was.
[82:49.76]Oh god, what about, this is him.
[82:51.20]It's this guy.
[82:51.66]Is he gonna fight me?
[82:53.08]Don't fight me.
[82:56.43]No!
[82:57.21]Okay, I'm fine!
[82:57.99]There's a bonfire!
[82:58.73]Touch it!
[83:01.11]Sit on it quick before it gets down here!
[83:25.51]Oh my God, I made it.
[83:31.59]Wait, what are you doing here?
[83:32.47]It's too bright for your eyes.
[83:38.30]You can't handle it.
[83:44.98]Get up, get up, get up.
[83:50.71]I'm finished.
[83:52.09]What did I ever do?
[83:55.97]Jesus.
[83:57.77]Humanity.
[83:59.56]Crescent Axe.
[84:03.82]Ay-yi-yi.
[84:04.70]This was... I did not like this shit.
[84:07.16]I did not like what we just did.
[84:10.72]That hurt on another level.
[84:14.19]So I need to Reverse Hollowing and Kindle this fire.
[84:22.81]I've got plenty of Humanity.
[84:40.14]That's what happens when you say you're a cleric.
[84:43.36]Well, how was I supposed to know?
[84:44.52]I think I can level up one more time, though.
[84:49.13]If I use both of these, we should be there.
[84:56.27]If I use both of these, we should be close.
[85:01.06]Ooh, it's going to be really close.
[85:02.74]Do I have anything else?
[85:03.94]Yes, I do.
[85:09.39]What do I need?
[85:15.18]Let's see.
[85:15.92]24.
[85:15.94]Okay, I gotta kill something.
[85:23.00]You know, I don't think I'm gonna be using the Iron Golem.
[85:30.38]Shit, I need more souls, huh?
[85:34.00]Yeah, I'm gonna kill the Crush the Iron Golem one.
[85:37.16]I don't think I'm ever gonna use it.
[85:38.74]We'll get the hammer eventually, but... I'm not gonna use this.
[85:42.42]I'm certain of it.
[85:50.06]I do need more Estus too.
[85:51.32]Like, there's a lot of things I need.
[85:52.52]I didn't do before the stream started.
[86:00.84]Holy shit, that's a lot of souls.
[86:05.40]Alright, we're at 30, 30, 40.
[86:07.02]Now I can kind of mess around here.
[86:10.26]Don't use it.
[86:11.72]I'm certain I'm not going to use anything that comes out of that.
[86:13.92]I have the weapons that I'm going to use.
[86:17.65]I'm using the Butcher's Knife and the Dragon Greataxe.
[86:22.05]Those are the two weapons I'm going to be using.
[86:24.47]So, I'm sorry I might not use your favorite weapon in the game.
[86:28.38]I'm not going to use it.
[86:28.92]We're going to get Smog's Hammer to have fun.
[86:36.06]But I can tell you right now, I'm 100% certain I'm not going to use that item.
[86:40.70]Whatever it is.
[86:43.90]Alright, now... I can't go this way, so we have to go back up.
[86:50.01]Right?
[86:52.19]I guess I could go and try to go down where all those people were?
[86:59.89]There's that place I could drop down with the three giants.
[87:06.00]Yeah, I already did that.
[87:07.64]Nothing else over here?
[87:08.40]It might be.
[87:09.12]There's another way to go.
[87:13.66]Okay, you're a different looking thing.
[87:18.19]That's what I was hearing.
[87:18.89]It was this guy.
[87:22.33]Oh, you're fast.
[87:25.79]You need a lot of health, too.
[87:37.40]Up the ass?
[87:37.96]Can I go up the ass with this guy?
[87:40.58]Apparently not.
[87:42.30]Maybe you can.
[87:44.66]Uh, there's a fog gate.
[87:48.20]Just gonna go through it.
[87:49.34]Why not?
[87:57.77]Oh, fuck.
[88:04.92]Oh my fucking holy shit, man!
[88:06.30]There are two!
[88:06.74]There are two!
[88:07.36]There are two!
[88:08.42]Okay, I'm dead.
[88:10.86]That's insane.
[88:23.09]Well... This sucks.
[88:29.43]I'm so glad I have a bonfire here though, because this place is the worst.
[88:32.87]Actually the worst.
[88:40.82]I mean, I could, let me go... I wanna just go down here.
[88:46.80]Just, I need to.
[88:47.46]It's that way, I could go that ladder, let's just, I wanna go down here, I'm just doing it, fuck it, we're just gonna jump off, who cares.
[89:03.58]Well, there sure are a fucking lot of you in here.
[89:19.27]items item all the way back here this is a vendor large divine ember backstab come on sorry okay that's all that's down here is just
[89:50.54]Andre's pretend dead body.
[89:51.98]At least I got it.
[90:01.51]Does this open?
[90:03.73]Nope.
[90:07.43]Okay.
[90:16.95]No, that's it.
[90:21.31]The Tomb of Giants lives up to its name.
[90:23.45]There's something else over here.
[90:24.51]I have enough health.
[90:26.65]No, it's nothing.
[90:29.68]I wish I could shoot at the person shooting at me right now.
[90:36.60]Back this way.
[90:37.22]Wait a minute.
[90:37.52]Hold on.
[90:39.48]I think there was one other spot to check.
[90:42.45]Nothing.
[90:42.83]Okay.
[90:45.45]This area is worse than Blighttown?
[90:48.43]Uh, you know...
[90:50.67]You know, it's funny that you say that.
[90:55.79]Because you can see.
[90:57.99]I don't know.
[90:58.61]Yeah, I would agree with that.
[91:01.63]I don't like this place.
[91:03.11]I think this place is more difficult to walk through and traverse than Blighttown.
[91:09.81]Alright, I'm going to make this quick because these guys have HP.
[91:17.48]I wonder...
[91:19.82]Is it one?
[91:21.12]Two hits.
[91:21.50]Three hits to kill these guys with this.
[91:25.38]Alright, we gotta get the next guy very fast.
[91:34.61]There are two of them.
[91:36.27]You know what?
[91:36.71]I'm gonna pull him out if I can.
[91:37.75]Because I don't want to fight both.
[91:43.79]Come here.
[91:45.11]Come on.
[91:46.43]I don't want to fight you both.
[91:47.79]Follow me.
[91:49.49]This way, dog.
[91:53.65]Good.
[91:56.61]Good.
[91:59.81]God, that scared the shit out of me.
[92:01.28]I didn't think he was right behind me.
[92:04.22]Fuck you, man.
[92:05.12]Jesus.
[92:05.56]Oh my god.
[92:23.30]There's another one here.
[92:24.60]Where is he?
[92:25.04]Isn't he at the back this way?
[92:28.20]I'm gonna hug the wall.
[92:36.27]Where the fuck was he?
[92:38.91]What?
[92:39.33]You're huge!
[92:45.71]Where's the other one?
[92:46.25]Wasn't there another one here?
[92:47.03]Or have I lost my mind?
[92:53.85]It was, right?
[92:58.53]Yeah, he's right here.
[93:08.92]That didn't hit him?
[93:10.84]Oh, in the name of fucking God, did that not hit him?
[93:12.44]Well, at least now I know I can go down there.
[93:16.78]That's not a far drop, is it?
[93:27.17]What the hell was that?
[93:31.09]Okay, it's somebody's ribcage.
[93:32.13]We're fine.
[93:34.43]Alright.
[93:35.35]Going down.
[93:36.07]Don't get stuck up on.
[93:44.76]Don't get stuck.
[93:45.72]Holy shit.
[93:46.92]Dude, really?
[93:49.00]Why are you here?
[93:49.80]I need to put my shield on.
[94:03.48]Come on, it's a backstab, right?
[94:04.54]Yep.
[94:14.11]Oh, that didn't kill him!
[94:22.19]Fuck you, game.
[94:23.43]That's a fucking dead end!
[94:25.85]Oh my god, I hate this place!
[94:31.00]Oh, God, it's the worst.
[94:32.76]This is the worst place.
[94:34.72]This is the worst fucking place.
[94:38.57]Ever.
[94:38.85]I can't even put that on.
[94:50.69]Give me the grass shield.
[94:58.35]Alright, is it really like hard to fucking see anything?
[95:01.36]Yeah, it's like everything's dark and it's really- you can fall off like every edge of the fucking map.
[95:06.18]Here's just a silver knight right here.
[95:08.14]Watch out though, here he comes!
[95:10.37]You didn't know he was gonna be there?
[95:12.07]Just die.
[95:12.67]I wonder if I can just run fucking through these stupid dogs.
[95:30.55]Oh god, just go.
[95:33.83]I don't even give a shit if I miss items.
[95:34.96]This place sucks.
[95:38.46]I don't care if I miss the best item in the game.
[95:43.46]Nothing else?
[95:44.54]I need to go?
[95:44.97]I don't want to fall off an edge.
[95:52.27]I don't even care what it is, but I got it.
[96:03.02]I got it!
[96:03.38]I got it!
[96:06.04]I got the Black Knight Halberd!
[96:12.64]I got it!
[96:13.10]I got like the best weapon in the game.
[96:16.92]Oh fucking god.
[96:21.21]Alright, I got the item.
[96:23.23]Get me out of here, man.
[96:26.77]I cannot give you one redeeming quality of this whole zone.
[96:34.07]I can't... I'm trying to think of one thing.
[96:40.03]Can't think of anything.
[96:45.41]Yeah, this place eats ass.
[96:52.85]It's dark?
[96:53.59]Who gives a shit?
[96:56.69]Is that gonna kill me?
[96:57.27]I have no idea where I am.
[97:19.88]Please have it be over.
[97:22.07]Is it even remotely close to being over?
[97:27.65]I think it's over.
[97:34.51]I want to look at the cool shit.
[97:36.29]I was in that tree, wasn't I?
[97:45.10]what about over here okay it's it's light again I can actually see what I'm doing no I ain't falling now I'm playing as defensive as I possibly can cookie bug
[98:10.94]Got it!
[98:11.66]Got it!
[98:12.80]Haha, yeah!
[98:13.88]I don't even know what it was, but I got it.
[98:15.68]Fucking stupid ass.
[98:31.21]Dead?
[98:38.05]I don't like these little tiny ledges in the darkness.
[98:42.49]No, I don't want to do this anymore.
[98:44.41]I want to play like in the Dragon Kingdom.
[98:47.41]You know what I'm saying?
[98:48.05]Not like the great Lord Nito's favorite vacation spot.
[98:53.03]No, I want to like, I want to play somewhere where I think it's cool and bright and colorful and nice.
[98:57.37]This guy's gonna blow this and he's gonna come up from the ground.
[99:03.54]He's gonna knock me off the edge.
[99:06.09]Are you behind me?
[99:07.01]Oh my god, he is.
[99:23.61]Not today.
[99:24.17]You still- Oh, come on.
[99:27.23]Come on.
[99:28.33]Come on now.
[99:31.61]What the hell?
[99:33.97]Are you serious?
[99:36.19]You gotta be shitting me.
[99:41.51]Not even a fucking backstab.
[99:42.74]Get a life.
[99:50.84]Come on, do something.
[99:56.62]Another guy's not gonna be there to kick me off, right?
[100:04.26]That guy almost Hulk Hogan'd me off the edge.
[100:08.45]I actually almost got the big boot off the turnbuckle.
[100:12.83]Oh my god.
[100:13.75]Make it quick!
[100:16.83]Make it quick!
[100:19.43]There's pinwheel.
[100:21.30]Except it's not actually pinwheel.
[100:22.64]It's the fake pinwheel enemies.
[100:26.50]I should be careful, though, because I don't really know where I am.
[100:29.68]I can go down there.
[100:30.98]Let's go the safe route.
[100:34.32]What are these little baby skeletons?
[100:39.98]Come over here.
[100:40.48]Let me get you.
[100:45.74]Real cute.
[100:46.20]Get out of here.
[100:48.34]Back to hell with you.
[100:49.16]Look at how many of these guys there are, though.
[100:58.22]I need to pull the line of sight trick here.
[101:03.52]Oh boy, they're everywhere.
[101:08.34]It's a good thing that I turned around for no reason.
[101:10.86]Otherwise, I would have gotten so screwed there.
[101:13.91]This looks like an error.
[101:14.61]This looks like a run.
[101:15.35]This looks like a run, I think.
[101:16.67]If I'm going to guess, this looks like a run.
[101:18.37]Run.
[101:18.91]This looks like a... Yeah, run.
[101:25.27]Oh man, they're multiplying.
[101:33.55]They are multiplying.
[101:38.73]Oh, you stupid asshole.
[101:39.97]I have to kill him.
[101:40.71]I have to kill him before he does that.
[101:49.59]Could you farm these guys?
[101:50.47]How many souls do you get for these?
[101:52.94]Holy shit.
[101:55.22]No, is that correct? 600.
[102:00.59]Well, I know what we're doing.
[102:01.45]We're going to hang out here for a few minutes.
[102:03.83]You guys want to talk about some stuff?
[102:05.79]Anything that you think is interesting?
[102:11.09]This looks like the spot.
[102:16.46]Let's get rid of these guys first before anything insane happens.
[102:28.34]Head, right in the head.
[102:31.35]Check the corners, always.
[102:33.95]You never know when you're going to miss an item.
[102:45.64]I got a lot of souls, though.
[102:46.67]I can't really screw around here.
[102:47.97]I don't want to get poisoned.
[102:52.33]Although I do have some of those clumps left, don't I?
[102:53.85]I think that's it.
[103:06.95]Hello.
[103:12.22]Didn't get the backstab, but we tried.
[103:18.60]Alright.
[103:21.00]Check it.
[103:22.73]There we go.
[103:23.45]That's what I'm talking about.
[103:24.87]There's the one item that's hidden here.
[103:28.01]Chunk.
[103:28.29]I have a lot of these.
[103:28.97]I feel like I should be using them.
[103:36.60]Alright, now where are we going?
[103:38.28]Up this way.
[103:40.86]That is a door.
[103:46.73]Soul of a hero.
[103:50.25]Um, is this a boss?
[103:52.25]I feel like I don't have a good shortcut to here.
[103:57.09]Wait, item.
[104:04.03]How do I get that item up there?
[104:14.76]Isn't there an item right here that I've seen?
[104:21.99]What was I seeing up here?
[104:22.81]There was a glow that I didn't get.
[104:24.67]There it is.
[104:33.99]It's over here.
[104:39.04]Um, that looks like a boss door.
[104:40.48]I don't know if I want to do that right now.
[104:41.80]I think I want to... That's a long, annoying, horrible walk.
[104:47.80]Not yet.
[104:48.83]There's got to be some way to go here where I can unlock something.
[104:53.27]Because that's a very long walk.
[105:05.03]Too long.
[105:07.97]So now let me take this slow.
[105:09.31]Because there's a ton of things that I didn't kill.
[105:12.13]Yeah, I ain't doing this without a shortcut.
[105:25.37]I'm going to fight a boss right now without a shortcut.
[105:27.52]No way.
[105:44.52]I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[105:50.67]Why am I going back?
[105:51.39]Because I sprinted through here and I feel like I really missed other shit that I was supposed to get.
[106:09.63]Maybe not.
[106:15.23]I could use a sacrificial ring.
[106:16.75]That's true.
[106:22.33]Yeah, let's just try it.
[106:25.03]I'll try it.
[106:26.93]I think I am going to put on a sacrificial ring.
[106:40.34]I did miss a bonfire.
[106:41.35]I'm sure I did.
[106:54.17]Whatever.
[106:54.57]I mean, if it is a boss, I can just try not to die.
[107:03.41]Wait, what's over here?
[107:07.81]Ah, damn it.
[107:08.41]I really thought this was going to be like a saving grace.
[107:16.86]Put on the Black Knight stuff?
[107:18.16]Not yet.
[107:19.04]I feel like I want to get to a stopping point before I look at all that stuff again.
[107:28.47]Oh well.
[107:33.53]I'm going for it.
[107:35.55]Or I could... I wonder if I should bone.
[107:39.21]And then run back here after spending the... I don't know.
[107:49.46]I did it.
[107:49.84]I did it.
[107:50.42]I'm just doing it.
[107:55.75]No boss?
[107:57.55]No, this is absolutely a boss.
[108:06.02]What the fuck was the damage there?
[108:07.66]Come on!
[108:19.99]Didn't I just sacrifice myself to this guy?
[108:22.93]Why would I need to fight him?
[108:36.61]No, who's gonna fight him?
[108:39.59]Gravelord Nito.
[108:40.93]Look at my health.
[108:42.59]Well, can't take any damage, guys.
[108:51.24]Okay, I'm fine.
[109:03.56]I'm fine.
[109:07.13]That was loud as I may have ever screamed in my life.
[109:16.04]My speakers, I'm so sorry.
[109:17.98]That was air and stress that came out of my body.
[109:27.09]Like, I'm not even kidding.
[109:27.99]That was... Like, I just got in a car accident.
[109:32.45]You know what I mean?
[109:33.87]That's the, you know, I look up and all of a sudden there's a Mack truck.
[109:37.22]That's the kind of sound that I would make.
[109:38.96]I'm so sorry.
[109:44.78]Alright, let's do... Endurance.
[109:48.52]I wonder, should I... I don't know, maybe it's just all Endurance from here on out.
[109:55.46]Go all Vitality.
[110:02.81]I think endurance is probably more important because of, um, just equipment load.
[110:06.47]I can definitely do it again.
[110:13.97]You know, the reason why I made those loud ass noises is I really, I really thought that was going to be it.
[110:22.51]I thought I did it too slow.
[110:27.02]That hurt my ears and I'm sitting in the room.
[110:34.29]What do I need?
[110:34.85]25.
[110:35.85]I'll get there with one more of these.
[110:43.68]This is a lot, though.
[110:44.46]I don't have to crush a soul.
[110:57.99]I can get those right here.
[110:58.87]Let's kill that dog.
[111:10.58]Come here, dog.
[111:11.68]How many souls do you give?
[111:12.60]Like, a thousand or something?
[111:13.98]I just need to kill you and then, like, the guy that's down there.
[111:20.62]What do you give?
[111:22.28]Fifteen hundred?
[111:22.88]Yeah.
[111:23.62]Let's kill the other one.
[111:31.91]That should be the new sub sound?
[111:33.13]Well, I can't, like, do that right now.
[111:45.41]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[111:48.36]Oh my god.
[111:49.84]Where's my light?
[112:03.59]Okay, time to go back.
[112:04.57]Is that enough?
[112:06.72]Yes, it is.
[112:15.88]Where the hell was it?
[112:19.14]I am shaking right now.
[112:21.75]I thought I was gonna lose it.
[112:22.67]Where's that fucking bonfire?
[112:23.79]It's like right here.
[112:25.43]God, Jeremy, come on.
[112:36.32]And I should kindle?
[112:37.32]Oh yeah, I can kindle more than once now, can't I?
[112:39.24]Well, that is a hundred dollars.
[112:45.85]Amco the Terrible, thank you for the hundred bucks.
[112:51.81]Amco the Terrible.
[112:55.38]They say, thanks for the distraction from the California heat.
[112:59.66]Don't forget to change or look at the requirements for the Black Knight Halberd.
[113:05.09]Thank you, Amco, for the massive amount of money.
[113:08.35]100,000 bits.
[113:11.67]What is it, 10,000?
[113:12.29]Yeah.
[113:18.43]Thank you, dude.
[113:19.19]That's a lot of fucking money.
[113:23.31]Dropping giant stacks of money onto me.
[113:29.16]Much appreciated, dude.
[113:29.90]Thank you so much.
[113:32.22]California heat.
[113:32.88]Yeah, it's going to be 110 degrees, I think, when I'm in Vegas.
[113:36.88]I'm ready for that.
[113:39.34]Let me check.
[113:40.26]You know what?
[113:40.68]Let me have a second.
[113:42.85]just see I got this crescent x yeah but dude I'm definitely not looking to flying into uh into 110 degree heat in Vegas but gonna see how it is so this is this scales with faith in your part of California it's only like 70. where in California is that
[114:11.53]Crystal Halberd losing Gargoyle Giant.
[114:13.67]Black Knight Halberd.
[114:16.81]Requires 18 dexterity.
[114:23.75]I don't know if I'm ever going to get to this.
[114:28.04]I need 5 points to be able to put this on.
[114:34.56]Huh.
[114:36.38]I don't think I'm ever going to be able to get there.
[114:40.33]Reverse Hollowing, that takes some Humanity.
[114:42.23]So I'm going to Kindle this to 15.
[114:49.12]Take a twin Humanity, but I can actually just use two of these.
[114:51.26]I have like 19 of them.
[114:54.06]I almost just fucking pressed X on 19.
[114:58.62]Oh, that would have been very bad.
[115:02.02]I would have been so upset.
[115:14.11]This can be kindled to 20?
[115:15.45]Are you shitting me?
[115:29.22]Okay.
[115:31.76]Let me level up Endurance again.
[115:36.58]Time to go.
[115:39.10]Yeah, I don't think... 15's alright.
[115:40.50]I'll be good with 15.
[115:42.37]Now let me make my way down there.
[115:47.88]Hi, Drake.
[115:48.26]Yeah, you know what?
[115:48.74]Hold on a minute.
[115:49.49]Let me take my first break.
[115:51.47]I'm just going to piss and grab another... I'm going to grab actually another coffee because I have a lot of shit to do before I leave.
[116:00.39]By the way, if you're unaware, just because most people that are watching are here.
[116:07.19]I'm pretty redundant, I know, but everyone's trickled in by now.
[116:10.65]There will be no streams until Thursday after today.
[116:16.03]I'm going to be in Las Vegas.
[116:18.13]Looking for houses.
[116:19.61]Looking for places to live.
[116:21.71]So... I'll be seeing you on Thursday at the regular time.
[116:26.49]After tonight.
[116:28.63]I'll keep you updated.
[116:29.71]Maybe I'll tweet a picture.
[116:34.39]But I'll be right back.
[116:37.40]Charge up on some fluids maybe.
[116:39.74]See you in a second.
[119:13.31]How you doing?
[119:19.21]Look, we're back.
[119:22.55]Oops.
[119:25.72]And... Okay.
[119:29.14]I was about to go over here to slowly and methodically... Okay, so I can't parry with this thing.
[119:38.91]I was just seeing if I could.
[119:42.98]I'm gonna try to get behind him.
[119:46.44]Well, that didn't work.
[119:55.33]Okay.
[119:59.71]That tactic didn't really work out so well.
[120:05.34]Back up we go.
[120:10.20]New tactic.
[120:11.64]Called, don't give a shit.
[120:13.58]I'm just going and spamming.
[120:14.76]I'm gonna do the burger boy technique here.
[120:18.00]I was gonna run by and just get down there.
[120:26.53]Okay, I saw a bonfire.
[120:27.59]There's a bonfire over there.
[120:29.95]There's a bonfire over that way.
[120:36.23]Okay.
[120:37.19]Well...
[120:40.03]I know the direction of the bonfire.
[120:45.79]I think I've peed out all of my game sense.
[120:48.63]I'm not even picking them up.
[120:49.43]They don't even care.
[120:50.33]Get over here.
[120:50.93]I'm not rushing this.
[120:57.28]Okay.
[121:00.16]That's 50 bucks from Eefs.
[121:04.92]Thank you so much, Eefs.
[121:06.98]Jeremiah, love you lots and hope your move is nice and smooth, my friend.
[121:09.40]And loved the shit.
[121:10.60]I didn't see the end.
[121:13.88]I love the official podcast.
[121:15.26]I cannot wait for what is to come.
[121:17.48]I got some money left over, so yeet.
[121:22.03]Thanks a lot, man.
[121:23.91]I'm hoping this... Look, nobody more than me is hoping the move goes well.
[121:28.77]Besides me.
[121:30.65]Because it's an absolute necessity.
[121:33.29]Has to happen.
[121:35.83]But thank you so much, man.
[121:38.27]What does yeet mean?
[121:39.11]What does that mean?
[121:43.06]That means... There's the bonfire right there.
[121:44.94]Okay.
[121:46.12]Yeet means like... Yeah!
[121:48.32]With a T, right?
[121:49.00]Like, yeah!
[121:49.64]It's worth it.
[121:59.65]I wonder if I can drop down there.
[122:04.19]Like, can I drop from here?
[122:07.27]Probably not, but, you know, it's worth a shot.
[122:16.21]There's still an item I haven't gotten.
[122:23.57]Gotta lure this guy out.
[122:28.27]I actually might be able to just run right by him.
[122:36.72]Who the fuck is he?
[122:37.96]Wasn't he right here?
[122:38.56]Dude, there was a Black Knight.
[122:42.56]Right.
[122:42.92]Oh, he fell off the edge.
[122:44.66]Right.
[122:44.98]Okay.
[122:46.78]I forgot about that.
[122:47.44]Alright, there's the bonfire.
[122:52.24]I kind of feel stupid for kindling that other fire now.
[122:55.52]Feels like it was completely unnecessary.
[122:56.88]Because that's right here.
[122:58.16]Am I going to die?
[123:02.32]Is this dead?
[123:02.76]Am I dead?
[123:06.56]We're good.
[123:15.63]Yeah, that kind of sucks.
[123:25.01]Now, where does this go from here?
[123:30.33]Um...
[123:33.52]I don't even know if that's that big of a deal, man.
[123:35.93]That doesn't seem like it takes me that far out.
[123:41.37]I don't even... I'm not even sure that's worth kindling.
[123:56.27]You know what I mean?
[123:56.79]Like, am I missing something here or is it... I feel like it's easier just to...
[124:06.72]Well, whatever.
[124:07.66]Let's just get to the boss and actually fight.
[124:19.09]Actually, in the grand scheme of things, that's really not that far of a run from either one of those bonfires, so I was kind of overreacting.
[124:27.57]Actually, this sucks, though.
[124:28.83]Never mind.
[124:29.67]That was a complete fabrication.
[124:31.06]This is horrible.
[124:33.20]This run right here is awful.
[124:35.68]Absolutely.
[124:36.16]This is terrible.
[124:41.99]This is not a good run.
[124:42.69]This is a terrible run.
[124:51.47]Forget everything I just said.
[125:01.67]Here we go.
[125:07.20]Uh, let's put on my other weapon.
[125:09.02]This is my boss killer weapon.
[125:13.24]How am I running here?
[125:14.44]Bat rolling?
[125:15.04]No, not quite.
[125:22.03]Can I, like, take less damage?
[125:26.17]That's so stupid!
[125:28.55]That's dumb, man.
[125:29.69]What the heck?
[125:33.47]I have to take off all my gear.
[125:34.47]Alright, Gravelord Nito.
[125:35.41]Let's go.
[125:39.90]really okay well here's that I've got a feeling I probably should not even fight the skeletons or maybe they'll overwhelm me eventually I don't know okay where are you you got a huge guy is he the which alright this this is a situation I think this is a burn fight if I were to smell this it would stink like a burn fight
[126:07.76]Or is there like a dude back here I can fight?
[126:11.32]I wonder if this guy stops the skeletons.
[126:14.18]Oh my goodness.
[126:15.44]Okay.
[126:15.94]Well, there is a ton of people here.
[126:24.67]Holy shit.
[126:26.29]Whoa.
[126:27.95]Okay.
[126:34.73]Ha ha ha.
[126:35.73]Ha ha ha ha.
[126:41.89]Well, we're not gonna fight those guys.
[126:49.42]Look, I mean, you give me a giant pillar here.
[126:51.66]Do you think I'm not gonna use it?
[126:58.20]Oh my god, he was waiting for me.
[127:01.98]Did I just, like, get really unlucky walking into that or what?
[127:05.45]I'm not sure.
[127:06.65]We have to go the other way now.
[127:21.49]Well, here we go.
[127:28.01]Alright, I think I understand.
[127:33.10]I can see how this could get really unlucky.
[127:37.06]Well, okay, when you hear the scream, when you hear the sub sound, that's when you know you have to move.
[127:42.08]Like this.
[127:43.24]Dive, dive, dive!
[127:44.79]Ahhhh!
[127:50.60]Oh, this is horrible.
[127:53.59]I'm so fucked here.
[127:54.85]Well, at least I don't know what the hell he does.
[128:10.21]Oh, wait a minute.
[128:10.81]He can kill them.
[128:11.87]He kills them.
[128:13.52]That's good to know too.
[128:14.84]Okay.
[128:19.91]Interesting.
[128:24.50]Please spin this way and kill them.
[128:32.75]Alright.
[128:34.99]Starting to understand.
[128:36.29]I'm not going to kill him this time, but now I get it for next time.
[128:49.18]well I get it now I get it now this sucks that I didn't kindle this oh I boned myself so hard here god damn it I'm just gonna do it fuck it who cares
[129:20.38]I wonder if I... Maybe I should just go back and touch the other one or just kindle this one.
[129:32.84]Do I have any divine weapons?
[129:34.08]I don't... No, I don't think I do.
[129:38.36]I mean... Maybe I have one.
[129:40.36]I'm not sure I can use it effectively, though.
[129:43.51]I should get this.
[129:44.33]This shouldn't be that big of a problem now that I know what to do.
[129:49.49]I'm just gonna kindle this.
[129:51.05]I got plenty of humanity.
[129:52.55]I don't even care.
[129:53.16]15, right?
[129:58.78]It was a waste to do it to the other one, but whatever.
[130:22.30]Ten.
[130:23.76]Fifteen.
[130:33.67]Alright.
[130:35.19]Let's do it again.
[130:36.65]The shield is not really a friend of mine at the moment.
[130:40.03]Neither, none of this stuff is.
[130:41.83]Does that put me, what does that put me at?
[130:45.89]I guess now the shield can stay on.
[130:52.71]I always agree, Chris.
[130:59.09]I can't see, though.
[131:00.29]Fucking stupid-ass dumb.
[131:02.41]Ah, I hate that.
[131:03.23]I can't wait to be done with this area.
[131:07.70]I'm just, like, passing over.
[131:10.60]Give me the fucking thing.
[131:26.42]Run, run, run.
[131:28.78]Excuse me.
[131:29.46]Am I going the right fucking way?
[131:36.68]Yeah, okay.
[131:37.14]I was gonna say, where the hell am I going?
[131:48.21]I think... I'm not sure I like the ice cream cone here.
[132:05.00]What?
[132:05.30]Where is this guy?
[132:07.10]Dark Spirit Leroy?
[132:12.38]Where are you?
[132:13.90]What?
[132:15.06]I thought that was Leroy.
[132:16.43]It's not.
[132:20.97]There he is.
[132:21.61]You can't fool me.
[132:22.37]You know what I mean?
[132:23.19]You can't.
[132:25.39]Doof!
[132:29.33]What's he doing?
[132:29.75]What's he doing?
[132:30.29]What's that thing?
[132:30.77]Oh, it's just a heal.
[132:41.19]Okay.
[132:42.99]Paladin leader.
[132:44.35]21,000.
[132:44.91]And some humanity.
[132:49.47]And a grant.
[132:50.25]And more humanity.
[132:50.95]And Sanctus.
[132:51.67]That's a lot of souls.
[132:54.39]Am I going to bone back right now?
[132:58.24]Yeah, I gotta bone back.
[132:59.79]I mean, I gotta spend those.
[133:01.05]That's a lot.
[133:03.63]Damn it.
[133:11.18]I need one more.
[133:11.86]I know that was pretty lazy, but, you know, it is what it is.
[133:28.35]Okay.
[133:28.83]Let's keep going.
[133:29.67]17 Estus.
[133:36.02]What a helpful invader.
[133:37.10]I know, really.
[133:39.48]Alright.
[133:40.18]Let's do it again.
[133:41.00]Can I drop down there?
[133:51.40]No.
[133:51.88]That's a bad idea.
[133:52.64]I can drop down here, though.
[134:03.72]Check those weapons out.
[134:06.12]After I fight Mr. Nito again, I will check them out.
[134:13.91]50 bucks from Lorag.
[134:18.43]Thank you, Lorag, for the $50.
[134:23.13]Lorag 98, to be exact.
[134:26.66]Quite a few large amounts of money being given.
[134:30.46]Thanks a lot, dude.
[134:30.94]Just wanted to thank you for all the laughs and introducing me to games like Dark Souls and Sorcery.
[134:35.06]Have some goober dollars.
[134:37.48]Legal tender at any participating goofy goobers.
[134:43.28]Oh, God.
[134:45.32]What is a goofy goober?
[134:50.44]But yeah, man, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[134:52.42]Much appreciated.
[134:53.04]I am happy to introduce anybody to Sorcery.
[134:57.43]That's one of the best games ever.
[134:58.41]By the way, if you've never even heard of what Sorcery is, it's a choose-your-own-adventure game that they ported.
[135:05.07]It's an old one, but it's definitely one of the best.
[135:09.64]If you've ever wanted to play a game that's a very in-depth choose-your-own-adventure game, I highly recommend you do it.
[135:17.18]Almost just got kicked in the face.
[135:26.63]Hold on a second.
[135:29.10]That's not from that Twitch Old Spice thing, right?
[135:31.30]Where they locked the guy in the woods and Twitch chat made the guy say and do whatever they wanted.
[135:37.20]That is what that is.
[135:41.90]I know what that is.
[135:44.41]Can't wait to take a bunch of damage here.
[135:51.83]This is the worst.
[135:52.55]I really hate this part.
[136:00.41]No, there's no getting away from that.
[136:01.71]Alright, don't get overwhelmed.
[136:04.01]Let's fill it up and let's kite everybody around and then bring them over to Lord Nito.
[136:19.07]Stuck in the wedge there.
[136:20.33]Remember guys, make sure you put random shit in the way during a boss fight like this.
[136:25.49]It's really great.
[136:26.43]I'm dead.
[136:28.48]You know, please, please put shit in the way in this circle where he takes up the whole circle and you can get wedged in the... Just put them there.
[136:36.70]Put just random fucking trees in the way.
[136:39.98]On this stupidly difficult boss fight where you have to run around in a circle.
[136:45.33]Just do it.
[136:45.65]Just put a bunch of shit in the way.
[136:46.99]Do it.
[136:47.81]Why haven't you done that yet?
[136:49.45]Why have you not put a ton of shit in the way to ruin a game, to ruin it?
[136:53.15]Why would... We haven't done it yet.
[136:55.22]Do it.
[136:57.51]Jesus Christ.
[137:10.03]Yeah, I didn't say it was difficult.
[137:11.03]I said it was stupidly difficult.
[137:12.99]Like, as in, it's stupid.
[137:15.42]It's not hard.
[137:16.20]It's stupid.
[137:17.10]There's a difference between difficult and dumb.
[137:25.76]Dumb.
[137:36.93]Like, okay, Ornstein and Smough, hard.
[137:41.61]Hard, challenging, difficult.
[137:43.87]Not stupid.
[137:46.59]This is just run around a carousel with a thousand people chasing you and hopefully you don't get wedged in the wall while this big fucking burnt bush screams at you sometimes.
[137:58.37]Oh my god, I'm gonna die to these stupid things.
[138:05.87]I have to use, like, I'm gonna have to use, like, six Estuses here.
[138:11.19]Watch this, ready?
[138:11.75]Yeah, I'm gonna have to use four Estus flasks.
[138:23.94]Oh my fucking god.
[138:25.98]Oh my god.
[138:29.62]Don't you du-
[138:35.74]Oh, fucking having a great time right now!
[138:38.91]Having a great time!
[138:41.59]We're having a good time right now!
[138:43.61]Alright, kill them.
[139:04.84]Thank you.
[139:16.25]Not close enough, apparently.
[139:17.68]Come on, dude.
[139:18.08]You're going to swing over here.
[139:20.56]I think that means he's going to do a big thing in front of him.
[139:23.08]Yes.
[139:25.28]How far does that go?
[139:26.10]It's hard to tell.
[139:34.65]Ah!
[139:34.75]That didn't hurt him.
[139:45.66]Do the thing where you do the big bellow.
[139:48.08]Please?
[139:50.70]Good.
[139:52.26]I didn't dodge through that, I guess.
[139:53.56]Somehow.
[139:54.88]Some fucking magical way.
[140:02.98]Oh fuck, he's gonna do that.
[140:03.76]Oh fuck.
[140:09.78]Come here, Nito!
[140:19.73]Alright, take it easy, take it easy, take it easy.
[140:30.87]What's he doing?
[140:38.23]Alright, die.
[140:40.24]I didn't hit him.
[140:41.34]How?
[140:43.12]How did that not hit his fucking bush body?
[140:49.65]Alright, come here.
[140:50.43]You're dead.
[140:52.45]Get out of here, Nito.
[140:53.76]You suck.
[141:03.48]Lord Sol!
[141:10.56]That was not even hard.
[141:13.19]That was not even hard.
[141:13.69]That was just... That was stupid.
[141:18.77]It took me three tries to figure out that these guys don't run over here.
[141:26.94]I didn't like that.
[141:27.74]I didn't like that boss fight.
[141:30.24]Patch it out of the game.
[141:39.12]Okay.
[141:40.24]So I got a Lord Soul.
[141:42.46]Wait, there's more stuff here.
[141:47.69]Paladin helm.
[141:48.51]Ooh, that's going to look nice.
[141:50.69]Yeah, I didn't like this boss fight, so patch it out of the game.
[141:55.59]How entitled does that sound?
[141:57.30]I didn't like it, so patch it.
[141:59.58]I didn't think it was good.
[142:08.20]I made that boss.
[142:11.49]Alright, well now I guess we go back and put it in the cup, right?
[142:18.95]35 endurance.
[142:24.27]I sound like a reddit.
[142:28.97]Alright.
[142:36.15]You didn't realize you could avoid the giant skellies.
[142:38.31]Stupid boss.
[142:38.99]Well, how am I supposed to know that?
[142:41.12]It took me a few tries to realize.
[142:42.34]I still think it's stupid.
[142:49.92]So we're going to warp to... Where the hell are we going to warp to?
[142:55.14]Firelink and talk to Frampt?
[143:03.33]Nothing else I can do here, right?
[143:05.93]Am I fat rolling?
[143:07.63]No.
[143:08.53]I'm mid-rolling at the moment.
[143:16.46]Let's go to Firelink.
[143:23.34]It's worth a go back there and talk to Fran.
[143:26.22]Because I did get a Super Soul, and he's probably going to be really happy about it, so let's talk to him.
[143:41.82]Hey.
[143:41.96]Feed item, warp.
[143:52.41]Okay, hold on.
[143:53.11]I got a lot of shit for him to take that I'm not going to use.
[143:56.41]I mean, I'm hoarding a lot of these things for no reason.
[144:03.81]I want to look at some of them, though.
[144:04.71]None of these really give very much.
[144:08.54]It's not even worth it.
[144:09.28]Just hold on to them.
[144:17.16]A lot of physical resistance here.
[144:21.52]Why do I still have the rapier?
[144:25.26]I don't know.
[144:25.56]That's a really good question.
[144:26.40]This is a much better physical.
[144:27.74]This is 100 physical?
[144:29.38]What?
[144:30.46]Are you kidding me?
[144:34.01]Time to earn 500 souls.
[144:35.77]That's really not worth it.
[144:39.45]Do I have anything else that you can eat that's not cheap?
[144:48.88]Bye.
[144:57.82]You still made it.
[144:58.38]You're still here.
[144:59.30]I need to... I gotta go to Blighttown.
[145:02.12]Here's what we're gonna do.
[145:05.08]I gotta go to Blighttown.
[145:08.44]painfully because I need to get the other soul that's there the flask upgrade I have plus one this is bad so I'm going to go to I don't know which one of these probably chain where is a daughter of chaos
[145:38.97]Because I need to find this thing in Blighttown.
[145:45.89]And kill her.
[145:47.04]I'm not going to kill her.
[145:54.24]So now I need to get back.
[145:55.38]I need to find this shard that's in Blighttown.
[146:00.95]Wait, she has one of them?
[146:02.57]She has a soul?
[146:04.13]Oh my god, that's the easiest thing I've ever done in my life!
[146:07.75]She has one.
[146:08.36]If I kill her, I get it.
[146:19.88]I get a Firelink Soul if I kill her.
[146:25.17]No, I ain't gonna listen to you guys.
[146:27.87]I can't.
[146:28.49]I can't afford to listen to you guys.
[146:33.55]Half the time I listen to you guys, something really bad happens in the game.
[146:37.14]I get so ruined.
[146:39.30]All of my favorite things go wrong.
[146:45.72]I'll lose the bonfire.
[146:51.41]Now, I need to get the one... Somebody told me.
[146:59.71]That there is one of these in Blighttown.
[147:02.49]Now, do I have to kill somebody in Blighttown to get one?
[147:09.92]She's a firekeeper?
[147:10.70]What do you think happens when you kill her?
[147:11.88]I don't know.
[147:12.82]She's built into the wall.
[147:14.68]For all I know, she could be... Who knows?
[147:25.44]It's up in the... It's up the mill.
[147:26.80]Okay.
[147:27.94]I know where that is.
[147:30.67]People are saying I was lied to.
[147:32.43]Well, we're going to have to find out if I was lied to.
[147:37.13]There's poison here, but I don't even care.
[147:40.08]I need this thing.
[147:50.33]Back to Blight Time.
[148:00.19]She is the Illusuary Wall.
[148:05.80]Really?
[148:06.10]You guys... Okay, so like up here...
[148:10.61]Up this way.
[148:11.45]I'm gonna just look up here.
[148:12.40]I don't have the ring on.
[148:19.22]Up like the windmill.
[148:20.48]Up the lumber mill.
[148:21.36]Is that where I'm going?
[148:23.26]And I'm totally okay with you guys completely backseating this because I don't even care.
[148:26.83]I just want it.
[148:29.73]I just want the damn thing.
[148:30.75]Wherever it is.
[148:36.80]Okay, so it is up here.
[148:52.53]I almost just lost that.
[148:53.63]Alright, so it's up here somewhere.
[148:54.95]That's all I need to know.
[148:56.59]I'll figure it out from here.
[148:57.47]He's warmer.
[149:12.15]He's warmer.
[149:12.63]Oops, I missed.
[149:23.94]What am I looking for?
[149:24.46]I'm looking for the soul thing.
[149:27.46]To level up my Estus.
[149:31.66]Okay.
[149:32.00]You know... You know, it's time to get in a spot where I can do this.
[149:39.84]Just bop it off the wall.
[149:41.42]Hold on.
[149:47.86]Ice cold?
[149:49.22]What about over here?
[149:49.82]Is there anything over here?
[149:51.82]No, this is where I just was.
[149:54.54]He's ice cold.
[149:57.46]Don't tell me that.
[150:00.98]Up, right, down, back, left.
[150:04.04]Hold on.
[150:04.58]Up, right, down, back, left?
[150:10.15]Am I going to listen to the one person in chat here?
[150:13.63]Up, right, down, back, left.
[150:14.73]There's a guy shooting toxic at me right now.
[150:18.92]Hold on.
[150:29.03]Up, right, down.
[150:30.41]Okay, toxic, toxic.
[150:40.04]Oh my god, how did you miss?
[150:49.71]What?
[150:51.70]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[150:54.38]That is... What just happened right there was physically impossible.
[151:00.16]It was impossible.
[151:01.16]I hit him in the fucking head.
[151:02.73]That is an impossibility.
[151:06.45]Oh my god, I hate this game.
[151:09.47]Jesus Christ.
[151:15.73]Oh my god, back to the drawing board.
[151:17.88]I hate this thing.
[151:19.58]Is it right there?
[151:24.21]That's not it.
[151:24.63]It's in here somewhere.
[151:28.25]This is it.
[151:29.35]I know I'm warm.
[151:31.05]I'm very warm right now.
[151:32.39]You better believe it.
[151:43.06]I hit that guy directly in the fucking skull.
[151:44.78]Good.
[151:45.52]Fuck that guy.
[151:48.92]There's dogs down here.
[151:49.94]Excuse me.
[151:50.70]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[151:51.60]Excuse me.
[151:52.00]Excuse me.
[151:52.42]Excuse me.
[151:52.90]Excuse me.
[151:53.36]Wait a minute.
[151:55.16]Um, hold on.
[151:58.40]I'm not going to get swarmed by the dogs.
[152:04.28]Okay, get off my screen.
[152:06.40]Get the fuck off my screen, man.
[152:14.46]I did not hit any of you dogs.
[152:18.39]How did I not hit any of you dogs?
[152:22.74]Get out of my way!
[152:43.19]Is it like right here?
[152:46.37]What a terrible fucking weapon to be using.
[152:48.15]Oh my god.
[152:48.93]Stupid fucking weapon.
[152:49.87]Where is it?
[152:51.10]Where is it?
[152:51.58]Where is it?
[152:51.96]That's the worst weapon I could have fucking possibly brought in here.
[153:05.21]Like what?
[153:06.19]This weapon is so bad against everything in this whole area.
[153:11.87]Oh my god.
[153:14.78]Oh my god, look at how far away I am.
[153:19.41]Fuck this weapon.
[153:23.55]You swing over every... You only use that weapon.
[153:27.24]Only for a fucking boss.
[153:28.48]What a worthless fucking item.
[153:30.36]Jesus Christ.
[153:32.74]You gotta be shitting me.
[153:36.57]I saw, I know, but I didn't, like, I didn't know if it was behind those guys or over there, but still, the point still stands.
[153:41.61]Fuck that stupid item.
[153:42.75]Do you see how many times I swung over or through somebody?
[153:46.48]Like, oh my god, only use that for bosses, for any reason, don't ever do it, ever.
[153:50.14]Only use this weapon, because it's good!
[153:51.88]This is a good weapon!
[153:54.08]It doesn't take three seconds to swing and you go, whoop, let me just swing over your head, whoa-ho, did you duck for a second, let me just, whoa, swing around like a fucking yo-yo.
[154:02.76]Oh my god, that weapon eats ass.
[154:08.46]Look at how many times that weapon swung over somebody's head.
[154:13.92]Un-fucking-believable.
[154:18.82]Now I'm gonna go and ins- I'm gonna kill that spider in two swings.
[154:21.58]I don't even give a shit.
[154:23.06]That spider's dead.
[154:29.41]That's so infuriating.
[154:34.85]That's so fucking angering.
[154:42.15]Yeah, I did want a strength build, but just the fact that how much that weapon misses people.
[154:50.52]Actually mad.
[154:51.16]I am actually mad because that's dumb.
[154:53.34]I swear.
[154:54.42]I don't even, I'm going to repeat myself a hundred fucking times.
[155:04.39]I'm going, I'm just, I was right there too.
[155:11.81]Even at the top of the ladder when I first got toxic that first time, like, I should have fucking hit that guy.
[155:23.38]I'm just so... I have to run this.
[155:25.00]I have to run back like this.
[155:26.60]I'm so tilted right now that I have to go the long way to punish myself.
[155:32.22]I'm going to go get that.
[155:33.12]Why?
[155:48.01]What the fuck?
[155:53.13]This is gonna do the same damn thing.
[155:54.35]At least I have like an overhead swing with this.
[155:56.27]This is a fake reaction.
[156:00.17]You want fake reactions?
[156:01.31]I'll give it to you.
[156:13.46]And put on the ring too, you stupid fucking imbecile.
[156:20.24]Am I fat rolling now?
[156:21.18]No.
[156:29.30]You can beat the game with any weapon.
[156:31.00]I don't hate that.
[156:32.54]That's my boss killing weapon.
[156:34.69]But I can count on at least four people's hands.
[156:37.39]How many times I've swung over or around somebody with that weapon.
[156:40.73]When very clearly I should have been able to hit them.
[156:49.10]My god damn it man, I'm about to fucking scream Yeah
[157:18.84]Let it out.
[157:19.42]I am letting it out.
[157:21.30]That series of events leading to me dying in there was like 0 out of 10.
[157:28.73]Like negative 1 out of 10.
[158:00.43]I don't even want to be doing this shit.
[158:04.32]I'm gonna kill the spider.
[158:07.46]I'm gonna kill- I'm gonna fucking kill the spider.
[158:10.50]No, where are you going?
[158:13.38]What?
[158:13.54]Do you understand?
[158:20.49]Like, none of this has to do with the video game.
[158:24.25]None of this has to do with the fucking game.
[158:26.15]This has to do with the- Gah!
[158:34.50]I was having a great time up until 12 minutes ago.
[158:43.13]Oh, I want to do it so bad.
[158:44.53]No, I... No, I'll never live that down.
[158:57.14]Look, I want to kill the spider.
[158:58.48]You want to kill the spider.
[159:02.90]This is bad.
[159:23.75]There's another one in New Londo.
[159:25.15]I'll get it.
[159:25.73]I have to get this one.
[159:28.54]I can't let this defeat me.
[159:29.90]I can't let the room full of unbearable shit beat me.
[159:39.33]I have to just run into that room.
[159:50.62]I didn't even sit at the bonfire.
[159:51.78]I am beyond tilted.
[159:56.27]Stuff like this just puts me over the edge.
[159:59.17]Completely.
[160:04.01]I am so... I am more angry than I was at Ornstein and Smough.
[160:11.10]By 500,000%.
[160:11.36]By 6 million% more angry than playing the actual video game.
[160:24.04]I would rather you put a room with four Ornsteins and three smogs.
[160:29.47]And that's like, alright, I guess that's what we're doing now.
[160:32.23]Than have to climb up and do this shit again.
[160:46.72]No, we're not going to need the bonfire.
[160:47.72]Because I'm going to get it right now.
[160:54.65]We don't need a bonfire.
[160:55.43]I'm going to get it right now.
[160:56.23]I'm just going to walk right in the front door and get it.
[160:59.32]I need to go up the ladder.
[161:13.35]Get off me.
[161:14.91]This is the wrong way.
[161:18.77]That guy up there.
[161:21.25]He's the gatekeeper.
[161:50.08]Take the poison off.
[161:54.12]Where is it?
[161:54.50]It's right there, right?
[161:55.80]It's like right... Oh.
[162:05.26]Where is it?
[162:05.66]Where is it?
[162:06.10]Where is it?
[162:07.92]Out of my way, dogs.
[162:08.82]Out of my way, dogs.
[162:11.80]Got it.
[162:12.10]Okay.
[162:12.58]Don't even care about anything else in the game.
[162:13.70]I don't care about anything.
[162:17.57]Nothing matters anymore.
[162:28.89]Get me out of here!
[162:30.89]Can I jump on this?
[162:45.61]I got this ult.
[162:46.07]We're good.
[162:59.24]Thank god that's over.
[163:00.66]It's over finally.
[163:02.44]It's finally over.
[163:05.26]Oh my god, fuck me.
[163:13.07]+2.
[163:14.55]Ayayay, adios mio.
[163:16.23]My goodness.
[163:24.69]Now, on our way to New Londo.
[163:27.69]Because that's where I need to go now.
[163:32.23]Which is... Down from where?
[163:37.81]It's from here somewhere, right?
[163:39.24]I'm pretty sure this is the way I can go.
[163:43.04]I'm trying to remember where it is.
[163:48.06]You have to go down from...
[163:54.58]Not that way.
[163:57.16]Isn't it by where Havel was?
[164:01.69]Where was it?
[164:09.33]Can I go from Haunted Parish?
[164:12.95]No.
[164:16.06]Which warp is it?
[164:20.90]That's not the place underneath Havel?
[164:30.74]I'm going to a different Londo this time.
[164:32.46]Uh, this way?
[165:06.38]Okay, here we go.
[165:09.03]Let's go.
[165:11.61]Let's go to Anor Lando South.
[165:17.65]Alright, so now that we've got that out of our system, I'm going to take a look through here.
[165:24.44]I'm probably... What time is it?
[165:26.70]It's like 10 o'clock.
[165:28.88]Let's get to a position here where I can stop because I need to get ready to leave.
[165:49.76]New Londo.
[165:52.46]Let's explore a little bit.
[165:54.93]I can go up here.
[165:55.67]I think I've done this before.
[165:56.61]Isn't there like a Black Knight up here or something?
[165:58.11]No, this is the way to go to the Valley of the Drakes.
[166:08.72]New Londo Ruins.
[166:09.70]Is this guy sleeping?
[166:11.44]What the hell is that guy doing?
[166:16.48]Oh shit, there's a guy in here.
[166:18.75]Well, this is unusual.
[166:20.15]You haven't lost your head.
[166:21.79]And more importantly, you're free.
[166:23.67]How on Earth?
[166:25.05]Well, I shouldn't pry.
[166:27.67]I'm Ricky of Vinheim.
[166:28.69]I was once an established smith.
[166:31.67]Blacksmith?
[166:32.27]Look at me now.
[166:34.13]Can you believe it?
[166:37.41]Okay, well, what can you do?
[166:39.67]What do you bring to the table?
[166:41.65]Oh, no.
[166:42.59]Don't worry.
[166:43.45]I have no intention of escaping.
[166:46.01]It's safe here.
[166:47.63]Can't bear the thought of going hollow out there.
[166:50.72]Although, I must admit, how about this?
[166:53.96]I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools.
[166:58.90]I'll show you what made me the best in Vinheim.
[167:03.11]Well, there you go.
[167:03.89]Okay.
[167:05.19]Magic club.
[167:05.99]So he can upgrade.
[167:14.35]What else do you got?
[167:14.89]Heavy Soul Arrow, Sorcerer's Catalyst.
[167:16.81]Don't really have any souls or anything.
[167:20.31]Alright, well.
[167:23.95]Um, I guess we're going in the water.
[167:31.15]No, we're not.
[167:33.10]We're not going in the water.
[167:40.46]We are in fact going to go the other way.
[167:48.02]Okay.
[167:50.20]Good thing that's close.
[167:57.61]I mean, the whole level is water.
[167:59.13]I thought it was going to be shin deep.
[168:00.53]I didn't think it was going to be 100 feet deep.
[168:12.17]I'm still recovering from the ultra tilt I had in Blighttown.
[168:15.85]Yeah, that was hyper.
[168:16.87]That was hyper omega ultra tilt.
[168:22.38]I was inconsolable.
[168:26.38]You should have seen my face.
[168:27.16]I was like a dog.
[168:30.23]My teeth were showing.
[168:37.86]Okay, uh, I gotta go over there to that bridge area I guess because I can't go the other way.
[168:44.13]So let's just walk over here Here's the correct way Giant bridge
[169:07.08]sure s stock that's the parry crit melee weapon right from all the other Dark Souls video games that's really easy to get isn't it well here's a guy wait isn't this the guy that was at firelink what's this guy's problem what's this what's this guy's deal
[169:37.08]Oh yeah, he must have gone crazy.
[169:44.25]That's the end of that guy's storyline?
[169:47.29]He doesn't even say anything?
[169:50.29]Nope.
[169:51.11]He's just an undead that you kill.
[169:53.99]He had a lot to say before.
[169:55.53]Interesting.
[170:00.98]Transient Curse.
[170:04.82]What is that?
[170:07.71]Temporary curse allows engagement with ghosts?
[170:19.06]Oh, no.
[170:19.50]Don't... Okay, there's... There are... This is gonna be fucking wonderful.
[170:29.98]I get it.
[170:38.09]There are going to be enemies that I can't... See, how many souls did I have?
[170:42.95]Was it that much?
[170:45.69]I think it was enough to get it.
[170:49.52]Can't remember.
[170:50.02]That thing lasts five minutes.
[170:56.76]Is that going to curse me, though?
[170:57.76]That's not going to do anything bad to me, right?
[171:02.05]Last time I got cursed, it was a very... What?
[171:05.03]Is that an ember?
[171:07.51]Oh, I'm sorry.
[171:08.93]We at Vinheim don't deal in shoddy embers.
[171:10.85]The practice is trying old Smith.
[171:13.25]Oh, dick.
[171:13.91]Come back soon.
[171:14.67]I didn't have anything.
[171:15.45]Okay.
[171:17.73]Doesn't do anything bad and it lasts five minutes.
[171:19.39]Okay.
[171:29.92]I wonder if I should use it now.
[171:33.83]One step at a time.
[171:34.61]Okay.
[171:35.47]Straight across.
[171:36.09]I'm going to take out the shield for this because I don't trust any of these things.
[171:40.13]Because I'll die if I go in the water.
[171:47.04]Looking for ghosts.
[171:56.65]Where do they come from?
[171:57.29]The water?
[172:00.86]Can I walk on this water?
[172:01.98]Look it.
[172:02.48]That looks like I can.
[172:03.29]See, this is what I was talking about.
[172:04.19]I could see the things from across the way that they were shin deep.
[172:08.05]You tell me I'm gonna fall through this?
[172:18.52]There's a ghost.
[172:20.00]That's a ghost.
[172:30.49]more curse yeah I ain't fucking around with that so I can walk on this can't walk over there oh no this is I'm gonna fall off so many times it's gonna be such a joke they're gonna put a big drop in the middle and you're not even gonna pay attention and walk right into it oh this is gonna be terrible
[173:00.01]Hold on, keep looking around.
[173:09.00]Hide him?
[173:11.56]Yep, see?
[173:12.52]Okay.
[173:13.24]Oh, shit.
[173:15.26]Okay, we're fine.
[173:27.87]I missed.
[173:35.95]camera please alright what is this yes oh yes yes yes yes thank god first bonfire I get to a warping can't go over there
[174:06.23]Looks like I go up from here now, right?
[174:12.25]Maybe.
[174:13.39]I can go this way.
[174:16.66]Can I?
[174:16.98]I mean, that looks kind of like I can make it up there.
[174:26.04]Maybe not.
[174:26.48]Whatever.
[174:26.78]Alright, up the stairs.
[174:39.24]Bonfire?
[174:42.39]Give me one.
[174:44.11]I'll take a bonfire right now.
[174:51.03]There is a door.
[174:52.83]How can I tell when the curse runs out?
[174:54.35]Is there some kind of indicator or something that tells me I can... You know.
[175:01.71]Use it again.
[175:02.09]Oh, hello.
[175:05.82]Hello.
[175:09.88]Oh, there were two of you?
[175:12.58]Did not expect that.
[175:13.90]Hold the lever.
[175:14.72]Contraption does not move.
[175:15.73]Well, here's a shortcut.
[175:17.27]How are you?
[175:17.81]Oh, you guys are in the walls.
[175:21.19]Jesus.
[175:21.55]Okay, so that's the shortcut right there.
[175:24.05]Wherever that leads to, I don't know.
[175:25.33]Oh, I see.
[175:36.46]When I can use the item again, I get you.
[175:42.04]What is that?
[175:42.68]Staircase.
[175:44.62]And nothing.
[175:48.85]It's almost like they're ghosts.
[175:51.27]Almost!
[175:51.75]I don't want to fuck this up.
[176:02.60]Items sitting there usually means, please have something come and kill me.
[176:06.88]Always.
[176:08.77]Just the parrying dag.
[176:10.09]I knew it.
[176:10.51]I fucking knew it.
[176:11.21]Of course.
[176:13.51]Why would you be anywhere else?
[176:19.47]So if you really wanted to, you could come here in the very beginning of the game and just run and pick up all these items and use... That's cool.
[176:29.33]There's the door.
[176:34.50]Okay, it looks a little different.
[176:39.09]What are you screaming for?
[176:39.79]You alright?
[176:42.60]What's that mean?
[176:44.26]Okay, it's a really quick lightning lady.
[176:56.13]I'm so paranoid.
[176:58.25]Well, curse, that's good.
[177:06.06]She's summoning Nito.
[177:07.62]Well, Nito's dead.
[177:09.66]I don't think he can help her right now.
[177:15.60]Alright, let's open it up.
[177:22.49]Wait.
[177:23.05]Ooh, okay.
[177:24.09]Careful now.
[177:31.99]Good.
[177:33.79]Looking a little chubby.
[177:35.41]Well, that's because I am a little chubby.
[177:36.93]Kick the ladder.
[177:38.41]Cool.
[177:40.61]Before we do anything, I'm just going to see what that did.
[177:45.79]Some type of shortcut?
[177:48.25]I think?
[177:49.27]Maybe?
[177:51.25]Let's take a gander.
[177:59.38]I could jump from here to there.
[178:02.61]Fuck.
[178:03.79]But if I don't, if I miss this, I'm dead.
[178:07.66]But isn't that just, that's where I went before.
[178:09.68]Okay, hold on a minute here.
[178:10.84]There's a guy over here.
[178:14.21]Ugh.
[178:15.85]My brain power.
[178:17.29]That's my brain desperately trying to work.
[178:32.49]Okay.
[178:34.17]Ooh.
[178:36.51]More curse.
[178:37.51]Gladly take it.
[178:43.85]Way to walk over here, but I'm not going to go that way yet.
[178:46.76]Let's see what else is here.
[178:50.78]Item across the way.
[178:55.96]And dead end.
[179:04.75]When will I play Doki Doki Literature Club?
[179:08.45]I mean, I can give you a date.
[179:10.85]Pretty much, it's when society collapses.
[179:14.73]That's the day.
[179:15.13]I'm just going to turn it on.
[179:16.19]And be like, fuck it, David.
[179:18.05]It doesn't even matter.
[179:18.71]Who gives a shit?
[179:22.05]The world's ending.
[179:22.75]Might as well just stream it.
[179:27.40]Hmm.
[179:27.94]Okay.
[179:30.14]Pretty soon, then.
[179:32.34]Yeah, pretty soon.
[179:35.96]I'm gonna miss something.
[179:47.05]So that's just a way to jump across and climb up here.
[179:54.03]Pretty soon it'll... Yeah, alright.
[179:56.38]It's gonna happen.
[179:57.08]You'll see.
[180:01.66]They're on the goddamn roof.
[180:07.23]Come on, I can't do the pancake on you.
[180:09.63]Weird spot.
[180:12.09]Just wait till she comes down.
[180:14.11]And then just overhead swing and you'll get her!
[180:17.06]Nope!
[180:19.26]There it is.
[180:22.96]People said I was going to hate this place.
[180:25.04]I don't hate this place.
[180:27.36]It's kind of eerily empty for now.
[180:30.79]But I don't hate it.
[180:33.15]It's a little creepy.
[180:34.69]I will admit.
[180:42.44]Okay.
[180:45.86]Not yet.
[180:46.65]Oh, no.
[180:48.35]Am I waiting for an inevitable... This is stupid!
[180:51.67]I don't even know why this is in the game.
[180:53.84]I don't understand why this is in the game.
[181:28.95]Where are you get out of here get out of the wall That's not fair Take your Warsong Gulch bullshit strategies and shove them up your ass.
[181:40.36]I Don't know if that was a good idea or not, but I just did it anyways
[181:55.18]Okay, got a couple of items.
[181:56.22]One, a cross.
[182:01.07]Oh shit, I thought I fell.
[182:04.77]Green Titanite.
[182:12.40]Just watch the walls, I know- Wait, hold on.
[182:15.06]Still got a curse.
[182:15.92]I can see your cape through the wall, you're not fooling anybody.
[182:24.45]Like, I had a really bad hiding spot.
[182:33.50]What about this way?
[182:38.68]Uh, this, to me, looks like it is... The elevator?
[182:42.00]Remember that skip we were talking about?
[182:46.22]Um... Fuck, it's not it.
[182:48.61]What is this?
[182:49.03]Oh, damn it.
[182:55.75]well okay I can't make that move instead of curiosity
[183:27.83]nothing that way that little that yeah that little chirp sound is I can't even tell what's happening I feel like it's in the game I really do that's so stupid alright now we gotta go back oh this is the where all those drakes were I got that ring right there
[183:56.74]Okay, I know where I am now, at least in regards to the world.
[184:00.51]That's cool.
[184:03.89]I need a key to come back here, though.
[184:07.57]Which we will try to get.
[184:10.55]So.
[184:13.75]Back up here.
[184:21.52]Oh, more little places to jump.
[184:22.98]You don't shoot lightning, do you?
[184:24.90]No.
[184:33.95]Watch out.
[184:35.75]I'm too far through this right now.
[184:37.49]I ain't going to get backstabbed from somebody in the wall.
[184:41.08]Come on.
[184:41.52]Don't let that happen.
[184:42.46]Humanity, that's fine.
[184:43.46]I'll take it.
[184:49.36]What's my weapon?
[184:50.03]This weapon is plus 10 right now.
[184:55.21]Go over here.
[185:03.40]Lots of random places to go.
[185:07.62]Still have the curse on.
[185:14.11]I'm so fucking paranoid.
[185:15.35]Huh?
[185:22.48]Oh, fuck.
[185:22.86]I didn't see you.
[185:33.95]Rare Ring of Sacrifice.
[185:36.94]Which brings us back around the building this way.
[185:42.98]Can I go in here?
[185:45.56]I can't even tell if I can drop there.
[185:48.42]It looks like I can, right?
[185:49.70]Can I?
[185:50.16]I don't know.
[185:53.72]I don't think I can do that.
[186:00.22]I guess there's a... Somebody's in there.
[186:07.19]Okay.
[186:08.33]I'm in.
[186:12.20]Oh, I can climb this.
[186:12.92]I'm going to remember where this is, though.
[186:21.20]So this is right around the edge here.
[186:23.79]Okay, I know where this is now if I jump from... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[186:27.39]Is this an NPC?
[186:33.11]NPC or, like... Why is he turning to look at me?
[186:38.54]Okay, I can talk.
[186:40.64]Well, this is a surprise.
[186:43.00]I get few visitors, save for ghosts.
[186:46.66]You have the Lord Vassal.
[186:50.46]Very impressive.
[186:51.53]I know exactly what your intentions are.
[186:55.03]You seek the four kings whom I guard over.
[186:59.33]This is the key to the seal.
[187:03.59]Oh.
[187:04.25]The four kings slumber in the deepest chamber.
[187:07.63]Thanks for the key.
[187:09.17]Use this key to break the seal and open the floodgate.
[187:13.91]Oh, and do not forget the dark wraiths reside in a dark void called the Abyss.
[187:21.59]But the Abyss is no place for ordinary mortals.
[187:24.91]Although, long ago, the knight Artorias traversed the Abyss.
[187:30.89]If you can find him,
[187:32.93]And learn from him the abyss.
[187:36.23]Okay.
[187:38.75]So now I get the key.
[187:39.53]I know that.
[187:40.17]The key to the seal is now in your hands.
[187:45.43]I will help you in any way possible.
[187:48.79]Have curse broken.
[187:53.09]Oh, you can buy curses from him?
[187:57.33]Um...
[187:59.86]I wonder, should I buy a few of these just to have them?
[188:03.15]Probably.
[188:03.53]I'm just going to buy a few of them just to have.
[188:08.23]I mean, maybe it was a bad idea.
[188:17.82]Alright, so I got the key now.
[188:20.64]Now that should take me back.
[188:29.23]I didn't go here yet.
[188:35.29]Every NPC lives in a cave of reverb.
[188:39.87]Well, the world is fairly empty.
[188:41.93]I'm sure you've noticed.
[188:45.16]Well, I just wasted that money.
[188:46.34]Oh well.
[188:52.76]Okay, this takes me... Revolution?
[188:55.18]No.
[188:57.15]I want to check over... I feel like this is not the... Get the shield up.
[189:02.17]Where am I going?
[189:02.67]Over here.
[189:08.44]What's that?
[189:09.66]Pickup item?
[189:12.10]Why does this look different than everything else?
[189:13.96]This looks like a fake item.
[189:17.66]Is this a fake item?
[189:19.96]No.
[189:20.28]Okay, it's not.
[189:21.18]That looked fake, though.
[189:22.94]Didn't that?
[189:23.58]It did.
[189:23.91]I thought that was a mimic item.
[189:37.79]Just want to weigh all the options.
[189:41.33]Good call.
[189:42.09]Good reason for that.
[189:43.45]Wow.
[189:50.07]Whatever.
[189:50.41]Alright, back to where that door was.
[189:56.03]Was that the key to that door?
[189:57.27]Or is it the key to the big door?
[189:59.25]Lorag again with $50.
[189:59.75]Oh my god, hold on.
[190:07.40]Hold that thought.
[190:10.82]Hold that thought.
[190:11.90]Let me get to a safe area.
[190:16.11]Thank you so much, Lorag, for your hundred bucks total here.
[190:20.35]I wanted to use the last of my bits to let you know I genuinely think of you as one of the funniest people out there.
[190:29.50]And I love the stuff you've been doing on Twitch.
[190:31.66]You put in a lot of work and it shows.
[190:33.40]Looking forward to seeing what you do in the future without Comcast in the picture.
[190:39.09]Much love to you, dude.
[190:39.77]Thank you so much.
[190:43.45]It's a lot of money.
[190:44.35]And yeah, hopefully... Once the move is done... There'll be a lot more... There'll be a lot more shit to look forward to.
[190:53.77]Because the resources will be there.
[190:55.94]And I won't have to worry about... Desperately trying to find people to do things.
[191:00.82]They'll be everywhere.
[191:04.88]But thank you, Lorag.
[191:05.54]It means a lot, man.
[191:11.28]Means a lot.
[191:14.26]So back to it.
[191:16.28]Where was the door?
[191:17.28]I know I'll always forget everything.
[191:21.45]I think I'm going the wrong way.
[191:22.97]It was back here, wasn't it?
[191:34.61]Why am I moving?
[191:35.75]For two or three reasons.
[191:38.78]The number one reason is... number one reason is because I have to get to a better position with internet shit.
[191:50.41]The current internet that I have is so awful and I've had it fixed like 12 times.
[191:56.88]that it's become unbearable and I have to leave the house I'm in.
[192:01.78]Second of all, every kind of put-together video shit that I want to do is nearly impossible to do here.
[192:11.19]There are just no resources here in Massachusetts.
[192:14.41]It's probably the worst place to live if you want to make video content.
[192:20.02]There's just nothing here.
[192:21.96]And every time I try to get something going and something together, I run into so many roadblocks that make it impossible.
[192:29.10]So... Out in Las Vegas, which is an hour-long plane trip to LA, it's also about 50% less expensive to live in Las Vegas than it is in LA.
[192:41.82]There are about thousands of opportunities to be able to do what I want to do.
[192:48.61]Let me put on... What was that ring I just got?
[192:51.60]Boost curse resistance.
[192:59.36]You'd kill for an internet connection like mine?
[193:01.34]My upload is 0.3 megabits a second.
[193:05.58]Well, I mean... What can I say?
[193:10.13]I can't stream at the level that I want to stream and I can't do the content that I want to do unless I'm in a different place.
[193:20.80]I don't know where you live.
[193:21.44]That sounds really low.
[193:23.52]But... My issue has not been, like, slow internet.
[193:27.54]It's been... My internet goes off.
[193:31.29]And it drops down to... And another part of that is... I'm paying a shitload of money for my internet.
[193:38.13]Like, I don't... It's not just like a $30 basic package.
[193:41.03]This is $200 a month.
[193:43.44]For the internet that I pay for.
[193:44.46]And I don't get what I'm paying for.
[193:46.74]So, it's a huge waste of fucking money.
[193:48.48]The amount of problems that I have with the internet.
[193:51.43]So there's that too, right?
[193:57.32]No, hey, what can I say?
[193:59.92]I'm going to put on a different ring, though, because this thing, I don't really need it anymore, do I?
[194:05.40]Boost defense versus physical attacks.
[194:09.58]I'll put on this ring.
[194:10.50]Why not?
[194:10.86]I have double.
[194:14.12]Is the internet shit again?
[194:15.00]Yeah, I mean, it was shit this morning.
[194:18.10]I had zero upload speed this morning.
[194:21.14]Zero.
[194:23.34]I could barely load web pages.
[194:26.30]I was having socket errors.
[194:29.10]It's a fucking disaster.
[194:33.14]Fight for a refund?
[194:34.02]I already have.
[194:36.92]I've already done that.
[194:37.73]I've already tried.
[194:38.57]Alright, I need to pay attention here.
[194:41.55]Where the fuck am I going?
[194:47.33]Where am I?
[194:47.73]Where is it?
[194:50.18]It didn't still turn around.
[194:52.86]It was down like around... I just don't... I have absolutely no idea.
[194:55.78]I think it was over here.
[194:57.48]It was in this room somewhere, right?
[195:01.84]I'll find it eventually.
[195:05.50]I'll find it eventually.
[195:08.79]Walking in circles.
[195:15.47]God damn it.
[195:16.27]Where the fuck was it?
[195:26.45]Yeah, I'm trying to just remember where that even was.
[195:28.95]I just... Literally, if you paid me $50,000, I wouldn't be able to tell you where it is.
[195:33.13]I need to come out and, like, look.
[195:42.15]Left, right, up, backwards, horizontal.
[195:52.81]Is it out, like, and up around where I was before where the blue lights are?
[196:00.30]I am so lost.
[196:04.44]I can't fucking get out of here.
[196:08.23]Just get me out of this house.
[196:09.67]I just did the same thing.
[196:16.89]No!
[196:24.29]This way?
[196:24.93]I think it's this way.
[196:26.95]Yes, it is.
[196:37.34]Open the door, break the seal!
[196:40.51]Congratulations, you did it.
[196:44.55]Now turn the giant thing to open the giant doors in front of the Valley of the Drakes.
[196:55.03]I'm gonna drain the water.
[197:07.27]Well, that changes this whole area.
[197:10.45]Now I gotta go to the drained part of it.
[197:13.89]Okay.
[197:14.21]Well, that's interesting.
[197:16.03]Where are the doors?
[197:19.10]Damn.
[197:19.60]Okay.
[197:20.46]That's pretty cool.
[197:22.74]Now I have to go do the level.
[197:23.74]I have to... Oh!
[197:24.36]What the fuck was that?
[197:31.07]I'm so jumpy right now.
[197:32.97]Uh...
[197:36.93]That was a cryptocurrency alert.
[197:50.65]So now this elevator is down here, which leads us to... Right here.
[198:02.61]Okay.
[198:04.13]Ooh, this is cool.
[198:06.21]This is really cool.
[198:11.91]Hello.
[198:13.03]You're a guy.
[198:16.06]Parried.
[198:16.38]Watch this.
[198:16.82]One, two, three.
[198:18.98]Nope.
[198:19.36]Nope.
[198:20.94]Nope.
[198:22.14]Nope.
[198:35.38]Okay, finally got it.
[198:36.22]Nice work.
[198:41.50]Good job, Jeremy.
[198:42.21]You're very good at this.
[198:48.85]Items?
[198:50.59]No items!
[198:53.81]But why?
[198:54.58]I'm so paranoid right now.
[199:10.44]Only four astuces.
[199:13.33]Am I still... I gotta curse myself again, right?
[199:18.53]I mean, that's what I would do if I was still here, which I am.
[199:31.97]This looks too perfect.
[199:35.99]I knew it.
[199:36.43]See?
[199:36.53]I'm gonna fucking tell you.
[199:43.37]What the hell is he doing?
[199:46.90]Why is he holding up like a time portal?
[199:57.76]Go away.
[200:02.43]Oh shit.
[200:03.49]Okay.
[200:05.97]Looks like a boss.
[200:08.47]If I were a boss, I'd be in there.
[200:09.81]Let me check one more thing.
[200:15.16]There was one other way I didn't go.
[200:20.24]Right, I went through there.
[200:21.74]I didn't go which way?
[200:23.18]Up to the left?
[200:23.74]To the right?
[200:26.85]I didn't go this way.
[200:27.75]Can I go this way?
[200:28.43]I don't want to miss anything.
[200:35.21]This is where I came from.
[200:36.15]I don't think there's another way to go.
[200:44.98]Just don't want to miss the fucking super strength ring or something.
[200:51.76]Okay, well, here we go.
[200:58.38]This is it.
[201:00.18]Let's see what's in here.
[201:05.62]Um... I'm gonna keep the butcher knife on.
[201:08.43]It's easier to move around.
[201:14.01]Nothing?
[201:14.37]No breakable walls or anything?
[201:16.01]This looks like it could be.
[201:19.65]Will I marry your mom?
[201:21.90]Nah, single forever, man.
[201:23.56]Single with girlfriend.
[201:32.44]Not a boss.
[201:34.94]At least it doesn't look like they're... Oh, it's just this guy.
[201:37.92]And there's a Nito here.
[201:42.45]Holy fuck!
[201:43.15]Okay, there's two of these dudes.
[201:44.49]Okay.
[202:02.79]What the fuck is this thing?
[202:07.09]I don't even know if I want to fight this.
[202:08.29]I feel like there's no boss here, so I should probably figure out a way to get around it.
[202:12.17]No, I gotta kill it, right?
[202:13.11]What the hell is it?
[202:18.46]What?
[202:19.48]In the name of God?
[202:20.38]Um, I don't know.
[202:29.97]I think I gotta check.
[202:31.11]There might be like a skip or a shortcut here.
[202:34.48]That I can't really fuck around.
[202:36.18]Not right now.
[202:36.66]Not with two Estus.
[202:37.44]God damn it.
[202:48.25]Nah, I can always come back later.
[202:49.43]Let me just check around.
[202:54.90]That's deep water, right?
[203:06.01]There could be items.
[203:11.77]If I die, it'll be such a pain in the ass.
[203:15.58]I hear something.
[203:17.10]Who is that?
[203:18.04]I hear you.
[203:18.78]Of course, there you are.
[203:19.46]Come on.
[203:27.45]Really?
[203:33.34]God, eat it.
[203:35.08]You need to eat it.
[203:44.80]Fuck!
[203:46.70]I was too paranoid of falling off the edge.
[203:51.19]I didn't want to fall off the fucking side.
[203:53.93]God damn it.
[204:02.87]Oh, holy fuck, I'm far away.
[204:04.17]Well, at least I can upgrade the Estus.
[204:21.99]Okay, finally I have a decent Estus now.
[204:29.13]Whoops, wrong way.
[204:30.15]Okay, 10 plus 3, that should be fine.
[204:41.72]I did just open the front door.
[204:43.10]Hold on a minute.
[204:46.88]If I just... Where was... Hold on.
[204:52.90]Where's that Valley of the Drakes?
[204:54.50]Is there even anything there?
[204:57.40]Alter the Great Dark of Chaos, Darkmoon Tomb.
[205:00.24]Can I warp to that bonfire right before the double doors there?
[205:03.70]Or is it just faster just to go from here?
[205:16.57]Just go through Firelink.
[205:17.67]Okay.
[205:19.43]Easy enough.
[205:28.75]Alright.
[205:43.24]Don't you have to get going?
[205:44.16]Yes, I do.
[205:45.94]I feel like we're very close to something here, though.
[205:50.22]So, where... Is there... Are we close to a boss?
[205:53.92]I feel like we've gone through a lot of this area so far.
[206:08.49]No, not really.
[206:11.17]I'm trying...
[206:15.10]Take your eyes off the goddamn game for one second.
[206:17.05]Okay, so I lowered the water.
[206:39.52]Does that mean I can just walk over there?
[206:49.02]So now I gotta try to piece together in my brain the back track there.
[206:53.36]There was a ladder which led to the elevator.
[207:05.13]Where was that ladder that I kicked down?
[207:18.23]Oh, can I just go from here?
[207:19.51]I wonder if I can make a jump or something from here?
[207:26.88]No.
[207:29.00]Where's that ladder?
[207:30.28]Where are you?
[207:30.76]Come on.
[207:31.90]Right here somewhere.
[207:47.75]Oh, shit.
[207:50.98]Hold on.
[207:51.26]Wait a minute.
[207:54.88]Can I get... I can... This is not gonna kill me, right?
[207:58.96]Nice.
[207:59.28]Okay.
[207:59.66]Cool.
[208:01.12]Alright.
[208:02.08]Nice.
[208:04.28]Back where we were.
[208:04.86]Alright, this is not bad at all.
[208:06.26]This is fine.
[208:08.36]Just gotta watch out for this idiot.
[208:24.86]Sayonara.
[208:25.28]I'm gonna go inside of here, though.
[208:32.01]Item?
[208:33.73]Where are the items?
[208:37.97]Secret!
[208:48.70]There ain't no dodging here.
[208:59.10]Titanite chunk.
[209:01.64]Cool.
[209:07.12]Titanite slab is the last thing you can get.
[209:10.44]Am I correct with that?
[209:13.15]Like the other games?
[209:19.11]I just want to take the lantern out here.
[209:23.77]It's fucking dark.
[209:27.90]What am I still doing in the tutorial area?
[209:34.16]Losing.
[209:37.43]Being angry.
[209:39.95]Not having a good time.
[209:41.15]Okay.
[209:53.24]That brings us down here.
[209:57.52]What was the reason?
[210:01.24]Uh... What?
[210:02.96]I just went in a circle?
[210:09.05]I did?
[210:09.31]Oh, the world's so interconnected.
[210:15.01]I went in a complete circle.
[210:22.07]Well...
[210:27.39]Is there any items over here that I didn't see?
[210:29.01]I don't think so.
[210:34.53]No.
[210:42.83]It's a small world.
[210:51.38]Prove the world is round.
[210:54.18]I mean, that's not proof that we don't live on a flat Earth.
[210:56.65]I mean, come on.
[210:57.49]What is?
[210:59.39]I can stand in this, right?
[211:00.19]This is where that guy was.
[211:13.20]This is where two guys are, actually.
[211:27.94]Another chunk.
[211:28.72]Cool.
[211:30.34]Where's the other one?
[211:31.04]There's another guy in here.
[211:31.96]Another one of those knights.
[211:36.60]Illusion?
[211:38.40]Oh, that's too bad.
[211:40.38]I'm gonna kill.
[211:41.02]I'm gonna kill this dude.
[211:42.38]Let's give it a try.
[211:43.00]I wonder if I can block that spear.
[211:56.18]Asshole.
[211:57.81]Oh, you double fucking asshole.
[212:12.09]Proving flat Earth theory.
[212:14.80]Whoa, I don't know what that does, but I don't want it on me.
[212:25.39]Can you fucking do something else besides that?
[212:26.99]Is the burp like a corrosive burp or what?
[212:45.56]I'm waiting for him to do the spear.
[212:46.66]Do it!
[212:48.42]You fucking asshole.
[212:56.96]How does it feel?
[212:57.50]How does it feel, Blob?
[213:00.12]To have a giant weapon that's really slow that swings over enemies.
[213:02.84]Does that make you angry?
[213:03.62]It should.
[213:06.10]Are you pissed off yet?
[213:15.55]Okay, now I can look around this area.
[213:28.62]I haven't heard the other one.
[213:30.00]Is the other one even working?
[213:31.74]I feel like I haven't even heard it.
[213:39.08]Still, you guys are just... Oh my god, I didn't even see you.
[213:49.83]No, I'm sorry.
[213:50.87]Like, you ain't gonna fuck this up.
[213:52.83]Maybe you will.
[214:04.17]Oh my god, just fucking fight him.
[214:05.51]Like, if I can't get it.
[214:08.19]Jesus, man.
[214:09.03]You've done it like 14 times in a row.
[214:12.84]What a waste.
[214:26.45]Take a look.
[214:27.69]What did we miss?
[214:31.01]In the stables.
[214:37.45]I don't think I went through that.
[214:45.55]God damn, there's so many of you idiots.
[214:56.89]Humanity.
[214:57.55]A lot of Titanite chunks.
[214:58.97]I'm running low here.
[215:05.02]Hold on.
[215:13.37]So this goes... This is what I took before, right?
[215:16.73]I still have the curse.
[215:23.73]No, I don't.
[215:25.86]Bye.
[215:31.10]Let me get the item that's on top of here, though.
[215:37.05]There's one item up here.
[215:38.91]Lying across.
[215:40.73]That looks like I can get.
[215:41.63]Yeah.
[215:45.93]Give it to me.
[215:48.34]Brave warrior soul.
[215:49.80]And that looks like it's it.
[215:57.33]I could jump, but I don't want to.
[215:59.51]Take the unnecessary damage.
[216:08.10]Wait, hold on.
[216:08.48]People are screaming at me.
[216:09.20]Whatever.
[216:12.57]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[216:14.85]Did I miss something up here?
[216:17.81]Okay, apparently I didn't look over this way.
[216:22.16]Which I should have.
[216:23.82]My mistake.
[216:29.62]It's just so dark.
[216:30.36]I can't even see this whole area.
[216:34.28]Okay.
[216:36.20]Stairs going up.
[216:38.28]What about around...
[216:43.27]Chest checking.
[216:45.85]Nope.
[216:52.00]Oh, a Raspberry Jupiter.
[216:59.84]Chest.
[217:05.01]A very large Ember.
[217:09.54]I feel like that's a good thing to have.
[217:12.56]What about this way?
[217:13.46]Anything else?
[217:16.14]Nope.
[217:16.30]Let's go back to the elevator.
[217:25.71]And see where this actually ends up.
[217:28.65]Because I don't know.
[217:29.97]And I don't want to get hurt, but sometimes you have to.
[217:33.75]Didn't even get hurt.
[217:34.41]We're good.
[217:36.87]Uh, there's the other way.
[217:38.61]Wait, hold on.
[217:39.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:39.73]Is this the same... What have I done?
[217:42.01]No, I'm fine.
[217:50.34]Very large onion?
[217:56.44]I got the curse.
[217:56.90]Now I don't have to worry about this person.
[217:59.87]Hello.
[218:01.17]Goodbye.
[218:04.51]There's the lever.
[218:08.45]Now this is... Up here.
[218:13.81]Oh, fucking lord.
[218:19.03]That's a lot of you.
[218:26.04]Pull the lever.
[218:26.90]Pull the lever.
[218:27.78]Pull the lever.
[218:28.96]Pull the lever.
[218:29.78]I can't.
[218:35.40]Now I need to find a...
[218:37.40]Where do I go from here?
[218:42.27]Where's the boss?
[218:53.95]I don't know.
[218:54.37]This is just going back down.
[218:56.23]Okay.
[219:03.59]It's the wrong lever.
[219:10.96]Well, that's that shortcut to go down there.
[219:13.49]So I have to go back down there?
[219:15.03]So this is the skip.
[219:29.63]Wait, somebody just said I can't even fight this boss.
[219:31.45]Why?
[219:33.65]Was this whole trip worthless except to get the skips and everything?
[219:46.64]Eat the lever.
[219:47.25]Oh, I can't fight this guy?
[219:54.49]Um... I'm putting the fucking lantern on.
[219:58.45]Seriously, I can't stand this.
[220:06.24]Didn't even help.
[220:13.11]Uh...
[220:17.73]I'm kind of lost.
[220:22.34]The problem I have with this level is it doesn't seem like there's a direction to go forward.
[220:26.44]It's a bunch of... Everywhere.
[220:30.56]All over the whole place.
[220:35.25]Stop.
[220:38.43]Wait a minute.
[220:39.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[220:42.03]What the fuck is going on right now?
[220:43.97]What the fuck is this?
[220:46.13]What happened?
[220:46.74]Why...
[220:53.41]I'm fucked.
[220:56.20]I'm dead.
[220:56.50]See you later.
[221:01.25]I have no idea where I'm going.
[221:03.05]Again.
[221:06.55]Apparently it's this way.
[221:21.55]That was close.
[221:23.77]I'm trying to even close my eyes and see where that is.
[221:28.58]It's so dark down there, and it's just this gigantic stairway, tower, lifts, architecture, and just blah.
[221:57.77]Turn up the brightness?
[221:58.53]I mean, it's up pretty high.
[221:59.87]I mean, it's at 9.
[222:02.53]In fact, I am way too high for brightness, apparently.
[222:06.41]Alright.
[222:14.39]I'm gonna try this one more time and then I gotta get out of here.
[222:16.81]I gotta get on an airplane.
[222:29.35]The one thing I really find odd about Dark Souls, the first one, I feel like there are like three shortcuts that I got in this area that is like, what are they there for?
[222:42.02]I guess they connect to the other parts of the world?
[222:44.58]There's like four different doors to open that go to different places.
[222:48.68]It's very confusing.
[222:49.78]I'm used to playing like Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, where the shortcut, that's it, there's the shortcut.
[222:57.42]There's like three different ways I can go that are connected to the other parts of the world.
[223:02.56]It's just hard to wrap my brain around.
[223:05.50]This way, and then the elevator.
[223:17.05]Doors lead to other places?
[223:18.39]Are you fucking serious?
[223:20.56]Well, no, but if you're used to playing the other... Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[223:24.52]This is bad.
[223:26.02]Well, this is what happens when I just don't do anything.
[223:28.48]I literally need to get this pulled now.
[223:35.62]Come up here!
[223:36.26]Come on!
[223:38.48]There's 23,000 fucking souls.
[223:48.73]Fucking god.
[223:58.15]pain in the ass.
[224:10.88]What do we think of Dark Souls 2?
[224:12.82]I think Dark Souls 2 is a boss rush.
[224:28.14]So Dark Souls 2 is a boss rush.
[224:29.98]Dark Souls 1 is get lost simulator.
[224:35.80]Bloodborne is I wish this was 60 FPS.
[224:41.20]And Dark Souls 3 is you threw them all in a blender and made a video game.
[225:04.47]Is it true moving to Vegas to exclusively be an IRL streamer?
[225:07.81]No.
[225:08.83]I'm not gonna stream IRL in Vegas.
[225:24.76]That would be... I don't know if that's a good idea.
[225:29.39]I can get there from here, but for my brain to understand this level, I need to go up the stairs.
[225:36.88]And I'm even walking the wrong way.
[225:42.23]It's easy to be like, oh, just jump off the edge.
[225:43.85]But I need to see how this architecture makes any sense to me.
[225:47.19]You know what I mean?
[225:47.85]It's easy just to run off the edge.
[225:50.21]But my brain needs to wrap around how this works.
[226:00.51]I can't do any skips right now.
[226:02.67]I know it's easier for me to go that way.
[226:04.19]But for me right now... There's a way to go here that I saw last time.
[226:10.45]So I'm going to do it again.
[226:21.63]Just need to see it.
[226:23.64]I don't know where that guy is, but he's not here anymore.
[226:25.54]So this is what takes me down.
[226:28.08]Which leads to that...
[226:36.04]Come on.
[226:38.28]Send it back up.
[226:39.62]Alright, now this is that room, and then there's another one of these around the corner, I think.
[226:46.77]I don't know.
[226:53.82]Just fight him with the goddamn thing.
[226:56.78]Hit him twice.
[226:58.86]Three times?
[227:00.00]Sure.
[227:20.06]Yeah, I know.
[227:20.60]Come on up.
[227:28.60]Alright, now there's another one of these rooms.
[227:35.65]Um...
[228:01.30]I gotta, like, lean into my screen to see where I'm going.
[228:05.01]Okay, then it's this, so it's out here.
[228:09.61]Which wraps me around this way.
[228:11.03]Am I doing it right?
[228:13.23]Am I doing it right, Mom?
[228:17.51]Your swings are so fucking hard for me to predict.
[228:29.20]I'm starting to feel that... What?
[228:31.16]What?
[228:31.52]Why?
[228:32.48]That fucking hit you!
[228:37.04]I don't even know.
[228:37.64]I think this is it.
[228:43.66]I'm pretty sure I'm going the right way now.
[228:45.84]Yes, I am.
[228:53.15]God damn it, man.
[228:56.55]Well, I'm definitely yeah, I'm losing patience I'm starting to get like tired of playing to be honest Well These guys aren't even that hard to just they just swing.
[229:16.70]Oh my god.
[229:17.78]Fuck me.
[229:18.30]Oh
[229:48.86]That's tilted Jerma.
[229:50.10]That's just like... I don't know.
[230:12.19]Send it back.
[230:34.68]Just take a break.
[230:35.26]No, I'm fine.
[230:35.86]I'm just... I'm annoyed at some of these levels.
[230:39.77]I don't like them.
[230:42.88]There's, like, two or three areas so far in this game that I would put at the bottom of every Soulsborne area I've ever played.
[230:52.01]And it's just, like, tiring.
[230:53.71]Like, ugh.
[230:59.52]And they have to be, like, in a row, too.
[231:13.66]I think Blighttown sucks absolute balls.
[231:18.22]That area where it's pitch black sucks absolute balls.
[231:22.94]And now I have to be here.
[231:31.01]How did that happen?
[231:46.86]Send it back.
[231:52.06]New Londo and Blytown are pure shit first playthrough.
[231:55.88]Well, that's what I mean.
[231:56.66]Like, what the fuck?
[232:03.81]I just, I want to skip these guys, but you kind of can't.
[232:06.33]That's not what I wanted to do.
[232:22.09]No.
[232:25.17]No!
[232:25.81]I don't want to do those things.
[232:27.17]I want to do leaping R2, not the hold R2.
[232:31.48]Stop doing that.
[232:34.58]Just go to Gwyn.
[232:39.10]No.
[232:44.82]Oh my god, I'm so slow.
[232:47.14]I'm beyond the exhaustion point.
[232:49.62]For sure.
[232:49.98]Did you see how fucking sloppy that was?
[232:52.58]I was just like, yeah, just press R. I don't care.
[232:54.96]Yeah, it's time.
[232:57.40]It's time to stop.
[232:59.22]I gotta leave anyways.
[233:00.30]I'll try this one more time.
[233:01.36]Just backstab.
[233:13.06]It's easier.
[233:18.91]Fuck, I'm in trouble now.
[233:33.02]Alright, where was it?
[233:34.00]Over here.
[233:34.42]Where the fuck is it?
[233:44.04]There it is.
[233:45.86]I can't fucking see.
[233:49.43]Alright, here we go again.
[233:51.11]Come at me, room of fucking obnoxious enemies.
[233:55.77]Is it gonna happen or what?
[233:58.05]Where are they?
[234:01.01]Okay, where the hell were you?
[234:02.23]You were late.
[234:09.28]Jesus Christ.
[234:12.10]Fuck me, man.
[234:13.20]Every time.
[234:14.94]I just can't.
[234:28.62]No, I'm not- I can't- I'm not ready.
[234:30.68]I need to just get through that door.
[234:32.84]Why is it so hard for me to get in there?
[234:37.80]It's because the room- the room is black, right?
[234:41.30]And then these two guys just fucking run swinging.
[234:47.42]Just tell me.
[234:48.36]Are we gonna be done with the fucking black rooms?
[234:51.89]Is that gonna be done after this?
[234:55.83]Is there any light in this fucking Dark Souls?
[234:58.59]Or what?
[235:00.27]Does half the areas in this game have to be pitch black?
[235:04.12]I'm noticing a trend.
[235:20.54]Can't they make a light, souls?
[235:32.61]Well, there's the lava pot.
[235:33.63]Thank God.
[235:35.33]Blow my screen out.
[235:37.39]I want you to overexpose my whole screen.
[235:41.11]Just blow it out.
[235:43.67]I want to have my eyes hurt because of it.
[235:49.61]I want to be in physical pain.
[235:59.11]Am I going this way?
[236:01.62]Is this the right way?
[236:13.48]See, dropping down there, now I need to know where is the... Up here, okay.
[236:19.92]I think I'm just running in.
[236:22.04]Honest to God.
[236:24.64]I have to.
[236:25.06]Like, I just can't fight them out here.
[236:26.54]There's like four guys in here?
[236:33.16]Oh, shit.
[236:33.66]Invincible, right?
[236:34.66]Yeah, yeah.
[236:35.22]I'm dead.
[236:39.74]Yeah.
[236:42.94]Okay, it's to the left.
[236:44.47]God, fuck this room.
[236:45.97]Why does this room have to exist?
[236:48.66]There's five enemies in this room.
[236:50.86]One of them is as big as the whole room.
[237:12.81]Nah, I at least have to get to the boss.
[237:21.36]Upgrade the weapon and kill him in two hits?
[237:24.10]Uh, yeah, but I mean, that, I'd still... That doesn't, that still doesn't mean I'm not getting surrounded by them.
[237:28.80]Even at the front door, you'd have to fight those two guys and a ghost.
[237:33.66]Then... I'm having trouble with those guys right now.
[237:39.82]I'm gonna try, I'm just gonna run out to the left door.
[237:41.80]I just wanna see the area.
[237:46.46]Because if that is like the boss right there, then whatever, we'll stop.
[237:48.78]But this has been painful.
[238:15.48]Am I rolling off right here?
[238:22.34]Where is he coming from?
[238:24.93]Where are you?
[238:25.63]I know you're going to run out of the fucking darkness.
[238:27.31]Like, come on out.
[238:29.21]Come on.
[238:30.79]Where are you?
[238:31.71]There you are.
[238:32.11]I'm going to try to roll around him.
[238:43.34]Whoops.
[238:50.86]That's not the right way Here we go running to the left Okay, but there's a boss found the boss okay, we can stop oh
[239:19.55]Oh my fucking god.
[239:59.25]all that to just fall and that's it.
[240:21.57]I'm so defeated right now.
[240:29.04]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[240:37.71]Can we tell him now?
[240:38.53]Can we tell him?
[240:39.19]Can we tell him that was a worthless fucking last hour and ten minutes?
[241:09.35]Oh my god.
[241:12.53]Well, whatever.
[241:13.33]I can go there now.
[241:16.32]Eventually.
[241:25.68]And that's gonna be it.
[241:27.96]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[241:33.57]Imagine if you didn't have a chat to tell you you need a ring from somewhere else to fight the boss there.
[241:37.35]I would have just had no idea what the fuck was going on.
[241:56.16]Thank you, Kairotobi, for the $50.
[241:57.65]Tear up, Jerma.
[241:59.11]We got some great clips out of it.
[242:01.57]Thank you.
[242:05.31]I just can't handle the darkness.
[242:08.35]This whole stream was... Did you guys have to turn the brightness up on your monitors?
[242:14.98]I feel like half of the four... At least two hours and 25 minutes were pitch black.
[242:22.69]It gets to a point where it's just like, Jesus Christ.
[242:36.25]It's called Dark Souls for a reason?
[242:37.54]Well, why wasn't Dark Souls 2 dark?
[242:39.52]Why wasn't Dark Souls 3 dark?
[242:42.08]Why wasn't Bloodborne dark?
[242:44.96]Demon's Souls wasn't dark either.
[242:47.58]This is the one they chose to make pitch black.
[242:56.59]Imagine this shit.
[242:57.91]This is how the game wants you to play it.
[242:59.27]Imagine playing the game like this.
[243:26.35]It's true, Dark Souls.
[243:37.24]No, I know.
[243:37.60]I'm just complaining to complain, but... Alright, so here's what I've heard about Dark Souls.
[243:44.03]I'm going to ask all you Dark Souls veterans out there.
[243:47.74]I've heard that the first, like, there's, like, the before Ornstein and Smough, and then there's the after Ornstein and Smough.
[243:58.39]I've heard that the, like, the three or four areas up after where we just were with Ornstein and Smough, I've heard that they are, like, awful.
[244:09.34]I mean, is this true?
[244:10.66]Do I have to look forward to, like, another area that I'm going to hate?
[244:19.84]Like, after New Londo, am I gonna be like, oh, I fucking hate this place.
[244:24.31]For, like, a third time.
[244:25.07]Okay.
[244:40.03]I heard the end of the game is great.
[244:42.29]I heard that the last, like, half, last, like, third of the game is great.
[244:52.71]There's, like, before O and S, which is fantastic.
[244:55.23]And then there's the middle part thereafter, which is just, like, oh god.
[244:59.52]And then there's, like, the end of the game, which is good.
[245:01.96]Do I have that correct?
[245:02.68]Okay, good.
[245:20.92]Does anyone actually enjoy their first playthrough of Dark Souls?
[245:25.70]I am.
[245:26.48]I think this game is great.
[245:30.17]I just feel like I'm getting fastballs right down the middle.
[245:34.41]Not right down the middle, up at my chin.
[245:35.83]I feel like I've really not enjoyed the last like two and a half full areas in the game.
[245:44.90]Because the first... Oh wow, I love all this shit that's happening.
[245:47.44]This is great.
[245:56.34]Balls on chin.
[246:11.01]Sweet Tilt DLC.
[246:11.97]Yeah, that's what I'm looking forward to.
[246:14.27]Alright.
[246:16.13]Thanks everybody for coming out.
[246:19.05]I will see you all on Thursday.

[249:32.21]Oh, my God.
[249:34.73]I was in such a bad mood right there, and the Banjo-Kazooie sub sound just brought me back to life.
[249:46.48]Dark Souls man, I'm not playing this game again I'm only gonna play it on Thursday No, I'm kidding Thank you snoozing copter No, I'm kidding I can't get this far and then not beat it That'd be really stupid

[250:20.61]Also, I'm fine, thank you.
[250:24.89]At this point, we're drowning.
[250:26.29]At this point, like, I'm up to my chin in water.
[250:29.77]That's, like, how angry and annoyed I'm getting, you know what I mean?
[250:32.77]So every time the water rises, that means, like, I'm not... I just... I'm fucking angry.
[250:37.37]So we're just barely breathing right now with our head above water.

[253:00.01]It's almost time, Jerma, for my 100th bit donation.
[253:03.59]It's been a long time coming.
[253:06.07]But the time for celebration is almost at hand.
[253:07.63]I love you, Jerma.
[253:08.17]You deserve every quarter that will eventually lead to a big lasagna reveal.
[253:13.37]Odie and I have been hard at work on your book, and when the 100th donation comes, you'll see... You'll get to see the cover.
[253:19.05]Everyone in chat, get Garfin hyped.

[253:26.30]Thank you, Tara T for the $1.
[253:28.42]Thank you, Lukewarm Soda Can for the $1.23.
[253:31.62]I'm busy tonight and I can't stay for the stream.
[253:33.28]Have fun with chat's backseating.
[253:35.10]It was... Actually, it was pretty good.
[253:37.41]It was good today.
[253:39.69]The problem wasn't with chat.
[253:40.49]The problem was with Jerma985 losing his mind.
[253:45.31]At this game.
[253:52.12]Only the last part here.
[253:54.06]I feel like I held it together pretty well.
[253:56.20]Until... Needing to go back to Blighttown.
[254:02.66]And then coming back here.
[254:04.78]To the fucking... Giant water tower.
[254:13.45]No, it was fine.
[254:15.69]I'm just like... Salty right now.
[254:18.65]Like just covered in...
[254:21.16]That's just what this game does to you.
[254:23.04]That's how they designed this game.
[254:25.11]Right?
[254:25.97]They made this game to want... They wanted you to fucking hate this game.
[254:32.61]Imagine sitting there and designing some of these areas and being like, Oh, I can't wait until people fucking hate this.
[254:38.12]It's going to be great when somebody plays this and literally hates this game because of the part that they're playing right here.
[254:43.62]That's going to be great.
[254:44.32]I'm looking forward to it.
[254:48.56]Like when the guy, let's put it this way.
[254:50.71]When the guy does the big boot and kicks like 90% of everybody off that cliff, that's only there.
[254:56.75]That's only there to make the player angry at the game.
[255:02.58]That doesn't serve a purpose besides, hey, let's just fuck with the player right now because it's funny.
[255:09.80]There's a lot of those in this game.
[255:18.07]That's the point.
[255:20.11]Well, yeah, I know.
[255:22.01]That doesn't mean it doesn't make you angry.
[255:24.42]You can't tell me that your first playthrough of Dark Souls, you did not get very angry at something.
[255:29.80]That's just, like, impossible.
[255:32.16]No, you know, I don't... No, sorry, dude.
[255:33.90]You're wrong, because I saw, like, the boulder coming.
[255:37.57]I saw the guy that comes up and backstabs you.
[255:39.25]You know, the guy that kicks you and boots you off the cliff?
[255:41.71]I knew that was gonna happen.
[255:42.73]You know, what?
[255:44.31]It's impossible.
[255:46.99]That's like not possible to play one of these games blind and not get angry at it at some point.
[255:59.56]I didn't get angry at Patches?
[256:00.60]Well, neither did I. I don't think I got that angry.
[256:10.51]I knew everything.
[256:12.86]It's just that it's the nature of these games.
[256:15.48]They're designed in a way to make your life a living hell.
[256:22.92]But that's why we play them.
[256:24.48]Because it drives you crazy and you want to get to the end.
[256:27.66]Why do you think I kept playing over and over again to try to get through that door?
[256:33.60]Because you can't.
[256:34.28]You need to do it.
[256:35.26]You have to do it.
[256:36.96]Everything is built to make a giant wall in front of you that you have to climb.
[256:49.67]But, yeah, I love these games.
[256:52.15]They're some of my favorite games ever, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to be like, fuck this at certain points.
[256:59.32]Every single one of these games in the series, I've had at least one or two moments where I was just like, wow, I hate everything about this, everything.
[257:07.61]And then you beat it, you play through it, and then you play through it again, and then you know what to do.
[257:20.92]But, yeah.
[257:23.76]It's like a metaphor, dude.
[257:26.76]Pretty much.
[257:36.05]Thank you, though.
[257:39.63]Thank you to Maxi for the $1 stream and double sub count with hour-long sub sound.
[257:43.86]Loses channel when he compacts length.
[257:47.26]Oh, well.
[257:57.75]Thank you, Dunkey Arisen, for the $1.
[257:59.77]Hey, Jeremy, this is God.
[258:00.81]I'm glad to see that your new guardian, Angel Jex, is treating you well.
[258:04.51]Have you been eating your vegetables and consuming your daily ass intake?
[258:07.85]This is important for your health.
[258:10.17]My high angel, Garfield, has been worried for your health recently and so has bequested me.
[258:15.99]This is the same person.
[258:18.20]He said, watch this video.
[258:19.16]You guys... The saga.
[258:23.72]Go away, guard.
[258:27.99]Eat my ass.
[258:40.08]Thank you, Brandon.
[258:42.64]Thank you, Brandon201 for the $1.
[258:44.00]Jeremy, when is the Gremlins gizmo for the Wii stream?
[258:47.61]What's my opinion on Death Grips?
[258:51.49]Uh, I don't know what that is.
[258:53.05]Death Grips?
[258:54.67]I'm not sure what that is.
[258:55.46]Sorry, man.
[258:57.66]Thank you, Frexter, for the $1.
[258:59.02]Finally, you created an experience as insufferable as playing Dark Souls myself.
[259:03.59]Truly the most innovative streamer.
[259:08.33]Thank you, Felix, for the $4.50.
[259:10.45]We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie fed beef.
[259:19.45]Thank you, Felix, for the $4.50.
[259:23.33]Thank you, Tar Alacritten, for the $1.00.
[259:25.14]Jeremy, if you take away Orson Welles, I literally... I did.
[259:28.12]I'm sorry.
[259:31.10]G. Megon, thanks for the $1.00.
[259:32.82]Say hi to Charlie Briggs for me when you go out west.
[259:35.34]I'll give it a try.
[259:38.98]See if I can find him.
[259:42.00]Reblin X'd.
[259:43.20]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[259:46.34]This is exactly why I love you.
[259:49.00]Nobody can make something like a sub sound this funny.
[259:52.98]It wasn't even my intention.
[259:53.96]I just panicked because I didn't want to delete my Twitch channel.
[259:57.84]It was the only thing there that you guys hadn't heard yet.
[260:02.99]Thank you for the 10 bucks, dude.
[260:04.67]Thank you, Tar Alacron again for the $1.00.
[260:07.51]Sorry, I spam hit enter there and sent the bits before I was ready.
[260:11.55]Anyways, I bought $20 worth of bits and I was going to drop them on you, but you took away Orson Welles for the most obnoxious dying bird sound I've ever heard.
[260:21.04]So let me ask you, you would rather hear Orson Welles say the same sentence?
[260:26.22]Over and over and over again for four hours.
[260:30.98]I don't know what's worse.
[260:32.48]A little bird chirp or Orson Welles for four straight hours.
[260:39.60]And overlapping on itself.
[260:41.62]Only that.
[260:42.86]And nothing else.
[260:44.48]That's all we would hear.
[260:53.29]We would rather hit Tim Allen.
[260:54.43]That's true.
[260:57.89]Thank you, Tarlo.
[260:58.59]Thank you, Maxi, for the $1.
[260:59.43]When's the Jerma chimp emote?
[261:04.25]Who knows?
[261:07.35]Well, I'm gonna break this down for you here.
[261:08.59]Hearing the same audio clip on repeat for four hours, I am certain would turn away anybody that clicked on this stream.
[261:11.57]That is a 100% guarantee.
[261:33.18]A 100% guarantee.
[261:35.09]If you clicked on this stream that was a Dark Souls Remastered stream, and you hear that audio clip forever, you're going to be like, this is fucked.
[261:43.67]What is this?
[261:44.19]This is annoying.
[261:44.99]Bye.
[261:46.09]In fact, I actually saw people say that.
[261:49.13]There were at least two or three people saying this is fucking annoying.
[261:53.74]So... I... I'm certain of that.
[261:58.24]I'm 100% certain.
[262:07.54]It's lovely.
[262:12.48]Three people is less than 3000.
[262:13.84]I don't want to hear it.
[262:15.86]I have to like, I'm sitting there trying to concentrate on one of the hardest games that's available to play.
[262:22.94]I need to be able to focus on it.
[262:24.54]I can't just have it be like, Charlie Briggs is here, Charlie Briggs is here, Charlie Briggs is here.
[262:29.04]You float as shit.
[262:30.44]Charlie Briggs is here, you float as shit.
[262:33.46]You can't... That's like somebody sitting right next to you while you're doing something really focus-intense and just talking in your ear the whole time.
[262:46.19]That's like adding difficulty to this already insufferably difficult video game.
[263:04.06]but anyways thanks man captain Morgan thanks for the one dollar we know a little place in the American far west where charlie briggs chops up the finest prairie fed beef and tastes this is a lot of shit you know that you want one more one more on the beef
[263:25.99]chat just wants easy sub sound memes because why work honestly as a meme farmer when you can be a freeloader oh my god uh thank you shadow for the one dollar we know a little place in the American far west charlie briggs chop you know it thank you dude thank you tar alec run again for the one dollar notice how everyone stopped subbing when you killed orson wells
[263:55.64]Oh well.
[263:58.74]Oh well, I guess.
[263:59.52]Like, what do you want me to say?
[264:02.20]No, I gotta get as many subs as possible.
[264:04.24]Bring back the funny fat guy from the 40s.
[264:16.01]Oh, Orson.
[264:16.95]Oh wells.
[264:21.74]You probably lost $500.
[264:22.62]I had to pay attention to the game.
[264:32.94]Bring back that champagne guy.
[264:39.50]Thank you, Felix, for the $1.
[264:41.02]Hey, Jerma, I'm going to be headed for the American Deep West soon.
[264:43.44]I enjoy burgers and other grilled foods.
[264:45.88]How many places you would recommend?
[264:47.16]I prefer somewhere with prairie-fed beef.
[264:53.44]Uh, thank you Mighty Waffle for the one dollar, it's a clip.
[264:55.96]Here we go.
[264:59.36]Here it comes.
[265:01.18]I remember listening to this, this was on like four o'clock in the morning, every morning.
[265:04.89]It was awesome.
[265:07.55]Here it comes.
[265:17.51]What a classic sound.
[265:26.15]Here we go.
[265:28.67]I have to go.
[265:29.21]I have to pull that from Monster Rancher.
[265:32.59]It needs to be here.
[265:35.01]Thank you, Joey Retro, for the $1 maximum effort.
[265:37.37]Thank you.
[265:38.97]Hey, Luxuria Vitae, thanks for the $1.
[265:40.97]Hey, yes.
[265:41.71]Haha.
[265:42.05]Time for me to sit down in my armchair with a cold glass of Coca-Cola to view my favorite twitching streamer, Jeremy900.
[265:47.85]He is playing an interactive video called Dark Holes.
[265:52.91]Thank you.
[265:55.62]8-3-3-5-1-3-3.
[265:55.94]Thanks for the five bucks.
[265:59.53]Should I play Fallout 4 or Forza Horizon?
[266:04.37]Um... I don't know.
[266:08.79]Do you like racing games?
[266:13.35]I would say Fallout 4.
[266:15.02]But I'm not a big racing fan, so... That's up to you.
[266:21.08]Thank you for the five dollars.
[266:25.01]Somebody said neither.
[266:25.91]Well, I mean, that's an opinion, right?
[266:30.55]Thank you, Reaper, for the $1 Jerma.
[266:32.11]I was shocked that you revealed your chest hair fetish on the podcast.
[266:35.04]I will never lend you my tweezers.
[266:38.22]Come on, it feels nice, man.
[266:42.20]What's wrong with that?
[266:46.76]It feels good.
[266:48.31]Plus, they get all over the place.
[266:49.77]You can just get rid of them.
[266:50.49]They're not all scraggly.
[266:53.79]Thank you Twitchy Turian for the 250.
[266:55.53]There are 30 strip clubs in Las Vegas and 12,000 dancers registered with the Metropolitan Police Department.
[267:03.42]According to a 2012 Las Vegas study.
[267:08.02]Well, Vegas.
[267:10.18]It is Las Vegas.
[267:14.29]I'm actually surprised it's only 30.
[267:15.91]I would say like 40.
[267:27.20]I don't think I agree.
[267:32.64]At least so far.
[267:36.59]Although, if you asked Jeremy yesterday that question, he would say no.
[267:39.69]If you asked Jeremy today, after his full-on pitch black three levels in a row, he'd probably be like, Yeah, anything's better than this!
[267:50.43]This is stupid!
[267:53.07]You gotta catch me in the right moment, right?
[268:00.17]But... Thank you.
[268:04.05]Thank you, SirFeline, for the $1.
[268:05.26]I can't believe this guy is still in Anor Londo.
[268:13.60]I was in Anor Londo.
[268:14.58]That's true.
[268:14.98]It was a new one, though.
[268:17.32]Savior of the Dreaming Dead, thanks for the $1.
[268:19.04]Thanks for making me laugh.
[268:20.44]Love your stream, man.
[268:21.20]Thank you.
[268:23.22]Thanks for sticking around.
[268:26.40]Hey, Acid2223, thanks for the $1.
[268:30.79]Just a quick donation to my favorite content creator.
[268:32.41]You've helped me so much and provided happiness to my darker days.
[268:36.41]And I always make sure I catch the streams because I know I'll be laughing my ass off.
[268:41.07]Some of my fondest memories are splitting my sides laughing at your videos.
[268:45.55]No amount of money could illustrate the positive impact you've made on me.
[268:48.57]Love ya.
[268:49.93]And take care.
[268:52.60]You as well, Acid.
[268:56.38]Thank you.
[268:58.82]For your incredibly wonderful things you're saying about me here.
[269:02.45]Thank you so much, man.
[269:04.97]Take care of yourself.
[269:07.73]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[269:08.99]Seeing as how you haven't played the original Dark Souls, I don't know if you can answer this.
[269:11.79]However, do you think that they shouldn't... Do you think that they should have improved the game in some aspects?
[269:17.56]Like not taking a third of your health and fall damage and during Nito's boss fight that they didn't.
[269:23.74]Um... I really can't.
[269:26.74]I would be speaking from total ignorance.
[269:29.78]Blighttown is definitely way better.
[269:33.03]A thousand times better.
[269:34.89]Because you can actually play it.
[269:36.45]It's not like 28 frames a second.
[269:41.47]And even with that DS fix...
[269:45.72]I don't think DS Fix... Did DS Fix even really help in Blighttown that much?
[269:51.12]I don't remember.
[269:53.43]But I would be talking from ignorance, so... I can't really speak to it.
[270:01.72]Thank you, Amco the Terrible, again for the $100.
[270:03.24]Thank you so much.
[270:09.01]That's what I've heard.
[270:09.63]That is what I've heard, so I'm not too scared about it.
[270:11.43]Somebody said, Okay, so imagine the game is exactly the same, but it came out seven years ago and you have the original.
[270:41.51]yeah it really would have been nice if they I mean maybe they couldn't darks this game has such a rabid fan base that if can you imagine if they gave this the scholar treatment how many people would be holding burning pitchforks at some of the changes you know what I mean
[271:03.30]If they went through and... Oh, we're going to patch some places.
[271:06.86]We're going to make this place not, like, horrible.
[271:08.58]We're going to make this place a little more interesting.
[271:11.20]If they tried to do a scholar treatment, I think it would be way worse.
[271:13.96]That's just what I think, though.
[271:23.62]I would have liked it.
[271:25.44]But, who knows.
[271:31.26]Germicraft deleted.
[271:36.82]Because this does actually feel like a $20 patch.
[271:39.82]And not even a patch.
[271:41.06]They just kind of made some lights better and made it 1080p.
[271:49.98]It is kind of interesting that they want to sell this game for $40, and it just... It is the Prepare to Die edition already.
[271:57.22]With an uncapped framerate.
[271:59.78]That... So far, that just feels... Like, completely unnecessary.
[272:11.57]But I did never play the original one, so I guess this is the quintessential version to play if you've never played any of the older version.
[272:24.94]But thank you to Eefs again for the 50 bucks.
[272:26.60]Jerma, love you lots and hope your move is nice and smooth.
[272:30.88]Thank you again, Eefs.
[272:32.62]Appreciate it, man.
[272:35.96]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[272:37.12]Jeremy, I'm interested to see what the rest of the Elbertson household thinks of you abandoning them in Massachusetts.
[272:44.76]Uh, I haven't talked to any of them.
[272:48.49]No, that's not true.
[272:49.45]I talked to my father.
[272:52.51]And I told him I was moving to Vegas, and the way he is, what he says, it's funny, but oh, is it that funny?
[273:01.03]He does this thing where he scoffs.
[273:03.72]And I can tell he's looking up in the air and he's like, huh.
[273:09.31]He called me stupid.
[273:13.45]You're moving to Vegas?
[273:15.79]Huh, what are you, fucking stupid?
[273:18.50]And I was like, no, dad.
[273:19.86]Dark Souls is stupid.
[273:22.46]Did you ever play against Nito?
[273:23.88]It's stupid.
[273:25.86]Did you play that area where the dark, everything's dark and you need a lantern?
[273:28.38]It's stupid.
[273:29.26]And he goes, you're fucking stupid.
[273:30.61]No, you're stupid.
[273:31.85]And then that conversation ended.
[273:33.79]That's the last time I talked to him.
[273:34.67]It was like a month and a half ago.
[273:42.11]Thank you, Shrewberry, for the $1.
[273:43.82]You stink.
[273:44.74]Hey, come on.
[273:48.60]Lorag, thanks for the $50.
[273:50.10]Again, thank you so much.
[273:52.71]Appreciate it.
[273:54.43]How did you know Nito was stupid a month ago?
[274:08.36]Well, I mean, I'm glad you're understanding the joke, considering I played against Nito on this livestream.
[274:15.96]Didn't talk to I didn't call my father so You know it's like well, I mean I did go BRB it's true Gooby goobers Thank You Samuel fish for the $1 It's really a shame they had to rush the last portion of this masterpiece too bad They never got the chance to remaster it
[274:44.05]By the way, Goofy Goober is from Spongebob feature film, Atlantis Sponge Pantis.
[274:47.91]You walnut.
[274:51.35]Yeah, I... If the part I'm playing at, right now, this portion, just like... 80, 70 to 80% of people that play it are like, this, I don't like this.
[275:06.33]They couldn't have done something to even make it a little bit more fun or bearable or interesting, you know what I mean?
[275:14.37]If this is the spot that people like the least in this game, what's the remaster for?
[275:22.06]I don't know.
[275:30.28]They could have, but they didn't.
[275:34.74]When you get to Izalith, you will understand why people wanted them to actually change things.
[275:41.84]Am I going to get even more upset at some of the stuff in this game?
[275:44.15]You know what I'm going to do?
[275:45.93]I'm going to get oxygen.
[275:48.19]Yep.
[275:50.87]Well, there's the joke for the next stream.
[275:54.69]I'm going to get a fucking oxygen tank.
[275:56.28]And when I start to get really pissed, I'm going to start like... Now, I'm getting an oxygen tank.
[276:04.18]For Thursday.
[276:04.48]Okay.
[276:13.19]And when I start to feel, like, blood fucking curdling, I'm gonna just put the facecam on and, like, just start doing oxygen.
[276:25.88]You know you can die?
[276:26.84]I'm not gonna- It's not gonna be real oxygen.
[276:29.10]It's gonna be, like, a funny cartoon prop.
[276:43.01]It's not even a joke.
[276:44.97]But you can be the judge.
[276:51.10]Haha, fake oxygen.
[276:56.28]I'll figure something out.
[277:05.37]Ah, but thank you.
[277:07.89]Thank you, Samuel.
[277:10.72]SuperSpaghetti, I'm really sorry to hear about your dog.
[277:38.36]That always sucks.
[277:39.82]I'm sorry to hear that.
[277:42.79]I think about, obviously, my dog and dogs I've had in the past.
[277:47.77]I think about Otto, and it's always very difficult, so I'm really sorry to hear that.
[277:55.75]But yeah, I'm just trying to have fun.
[277:59.76]Just trying to keep doing things that I have fun doing.
[278:04.84]I got a little stressed out here earlier tonight, but... I mean, I'm also getting, like, on a plane and shit and going to look for houses.
[278:11.83]I mean, there's a little more... There was a little more going on besides me walking around with a lantern and getting angry.
[278:18.47]A little more going on there.
[278:23.42]I didn't get to have my new... I didn't get to have my green juice today.
[278:26.22]That's another thing.
[278:30.74]But, super spaghetti.
[278:32.90]Take care.
[278:33.46]For real.
[278:45.06]Uh, thank you, ZeroGiblets, for the one dollar.
[278:47.12]Still screaming, of course.
[278:49.68]Thank you, ZeroGiblets.
[278:50.76]Um, well...
[279:10.38]I don't think I'll play Darkest Dungeon again.
[279:13.12]Not because I don't think I... I don't... I think the game is good.
[279:18.42]But I... I just don't know if I'll be able to get back into it.
[279:25.85]I was into it for like a week or two and then it kind of started to fall off a little.
[279:31.39]But thank you.
[279:33.05]Thank you Fractal Swordsman for the $1.
[279:34.87]Congrats on beating the Bone Zone.
[279:36.33]Been watching you since the TF2 video days and you're just as funny when streaming and still keep my spirits up.
[279:41.34]Any chance you can stream Bloodborne and Dark Souls 2?
[279:45.02]B build for the win.
[279:48.34]Thank you, first of all.
[279:49.32]And I will not be streaming Bloodborne or Dark Souls 2.
[279:54.50]Because I like streaming these games when I don't know what's going to happen.
[280:01.83]And I think it's more fun to experience it for the first time with all you guys.
[280:07.30]Because Bloodborne would actually just be me going through the motions and knowing where everything is.
[280:11.34]And I would just bore myself with that.
[280:15.70]I've played it so many times.
[280:18.23]And I've also played through Dark Souls 2 more than once now, so... I would rather do it with newer stuff that I haven't seen.
[280:28.84]Both great games.
[280:30.36]Bloodborne is probably my number one single player game ever.
[280:35.38]There is that.
[280:37.12]Thank you, Tar, a la crin for the $1.
[280:40.14]Streamer sells every single other weapon, including other strength weapons, with faster attacks and longer range because he thinks his weapon has the highest damage number on the stat screen.
[280:48.75]Whiffs a few attacks because he doesn't understand his weapon and gets mad at the game.
[280:53.09]Well, that's not true, because I have the butcher.
[280:55.39]The butcher's weapon is also a strength weapon, and it's fast.
[281:00.83]I just didn't have it on.
[281:07.68]I was using the weapon I shouldn't have been using.
[281:13.52]And plus, fuck that area, with like seven toxic people that shoot the darts, and like five fire dogs.
[281:23.23]Like, that area just sucks.
[281:24.67]It's just annoying.
[281:28.01]You've got darts going everywhere.
[281:29.30]You have five flame-breathing fire dogs.
[281:31.28]And you have to get down there and run it.
[281:33.96]It's a pain in the ass.
[281:40.85]I've beaten Orphan Akaz... Yes.
[281:42.77]I've beaten Orphan Akaz by myself.
[281:44.37]Yes, I have.
[281:52.29]He was very, very hard.
[281:54.23]I think I attempted that boss probably 25 times.
[281:57.64]Maybe 30 times.
[282:06.64]Thank you, Ivory, for the $1.
[282:09.86]Thanks to your new subsound, I'm happy to know that you've answered the age-old thought experiment of monkeys with typewriters.
[282:15.04]Will you allow me to write my philosophy dissertation on your stream for future research?
[282:20.58]Also, good luck in Vegas.
[282:21.46]Stay hydrated.
[282:22.10]Thank you, Ivory.
[282:22.62]Appreciate that.
[282:26.80]I will try.
[282:27.26]I will try.
[282:37.41]Again, Laura, I gave $50 earlier.
[282:39.55]Thank you, thank you, thank you, dude.
[282:40.45]I want to use the last of his bits to say that he thought I was one of the funniest people out there.
[282:49.93]That's... I'm happy you think that.
[282:54.60]I'm glad you think that.
[282:56.84]It's very humbling to know that somebody thinks that of you, so... Much love to you, dude.
[283:02.94]Thank you.
[283:04.20]I will keep trying.
[283:06.79]Captain Morgan, thanks for the $1.
[283:07.73]We're happy to hear you're coming to visit Gamer HQ in Vegas.
[283:10.77]We're so ecstatic at this chance to finally rise up that we have pooled together our resources to present you with this.
[283:17.23]Now all the chads in Vegas will know not to mess with the gamer.
[283:27.46]What the fuck is this?
[283:33.16]I don't get this.
[283:35.29]This absolute unit is beating Dark Souls on stream, and basically, you're a fucking Chad.
[283:40.39]Bottom text.
[283:46.66]Thank you for that.
[283:49.22]Thank you, StarBar, for the four dollars.
[283:50.82]Move to Seattle!
[283:52.36]Atlas Network has 1000 up and down for 60 bucks a month.
[283:56.52]It's the best internet I've ever experienced.
[284:00.46]I'm sure it's fantastic, but Seattle is not close to Los Angeles.
[284:06.69]Las Vegas is.
[284:10.53]It's a very short plane ride for a lot of opportunities.
[284:13.59]And Vegas itself is also a great opportunity for a lot of entertainment stuff as well.
[284:18.61]I love Seattle.
[284:20.01]I've been to Seattle many times.
[284:22.43]Not just for PAX Prime.
[284:25.14]I've been there for plenty of reasons.
[284:27.04]It's a great city.
[284:31.90]Thanks, man.
[284:32.26]Thank you, SirFeline, for the $1.
[284:34.48]Pull the elevator, Kronk.
[284:37.08]Thank you, Sir Phelan, again for the $1.
[284:38.68]By the way, Jeremy, still in Orlando, a man of your talent.
[284:42.44]Still.
[284:48.52]Yep.
[284:49.20]Still in Lando.
[284:52.38]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[284:53.81]How long until we get a social eating stream, Jeremy?
[284:58.05]Jeremy?
[284:59.59]Okay, next question.
[285:00.81]Jeremy?
[285:04.17]I just sounded just like him.
[285:07.79]I don't like when people watching me eat think it's weird.
[285:09.64]I don't like it.
[285:10.08]It freaks me out, so probably never.
[285:13.52]Thank you, Vats, for the $1.
[285:14.78]Hey, Jermis, I sell burgers for a fast food chain.
[285:17.72]What's your favorite fast food burger?
[285:18.98]It doesn't have to be from a chain restaurant.
[285:22.57]Um... Probably something from the Shake Shack.
[285:32.81]If I had to pick something.
[285:35.63]Or a Big McDonald's Big Mac is just a classic.
[285:38.69]It's good.
[285:41.97]Thank you, though, dude.
[285:44.16]Pie Pie, thanks for the $5.
[285:45.90]Have a safe trip.
[285:46.48]I hope your search goes well.
[285:47.46]Thank you.
[285:50.40]I'm gonna give it a... Give it a whirl.
[285:52.20]We'll see if we're gonna live out there.
[285:56.86]I am now mostly moistened.
[285:58.14]Thanks for the $1.10.
[285:59.02]Hello, Mr. Elbertson.
[285:59.96]I'm a game dev currently working on a yet-to-be-announced Ape Escape sequel for SteamVR.
[286:05.55]I'm reaching out to you today to inquire about your voice talents after hearing that sub sound of yours.
[286:10.23]Let me know.
[286:10.67]You have my email.
[286:11.71]Let me have you go in there for a second.
[286:16.66]Thanks again, CairoToby, for the 50 bucks.
[286:18.16]Cheer up, Jerma.
[286:18.66]We got some great clips out of it.
[286:19.80]I hope you did.
[286:20.42]Because there was at least three or four places in this stream where I thought I was going to melt.
[286:26.94]Like I was going to just turn to dust in the chair.
[286:32.75]Thank you, CairoToby, again for the $4...
[286:36.00]You never go hollow and lose your mind to Dark Souls until you put the controller down and quit the game.
[286:40.92]That's why your character keeps coming back.
[286:44.64]Again, KyroToby, thanks again for the dollar.
[286:46.30]Remember when you really wanted to use the ice cream weapon?
[286:49.92]Oh, no.
[286:50.88]Everything in this whole area.
[286:52.14]Oh, no, no.
[286:53.14]Oh, no, no.
[286:54.28]I don't want to see this.
[286:55.65]Oh, this is going to be so stupid.
[286:56.87]I'm going to be so annoying.
[287:00.81]Everything in this whole area.
[287:04.71]my god oh my god look at how far away I am this weapon you swing over every this is oh you only use that weapon only for a boss what a worthless item Jesus Christ you gotta be me
[287:29.29]I saw, I know, but I didn't, like, I didn't know if it was behind those guys or over there, but still, the point still stands.
[287:34.31]Fuck that stupid item.
[287:36.33]You see how many times I swung over or through somebody?
[287:39.17]Like, oh my god, only use that for bosses, for any reason, don't ever do it, ever.
[287:42.85]Only use this weapon, because it's good!
[287:44.59]This is a good weapon!
[287:46.80]It doesn't take three seconds to swing and you go, whoop, let me just swing over your head, whoa, did you duck for a second, let me just, whoa, swing around like a fucking yo-yo.
[287:55.46]Oh my god, that weapon eats ass.
[288:00.52]Hey, welcome to Dark Souls.
[288:02.40]It was fun.
[288:09.40]Oh my God.
[288:10.22]What is this, another one?
[288:17.95]I went off like a few times.
[288:19.19]Everything in this whole area.
[288:22.95]Oh my God.
[288:25.85]Oh my God, look at how far away I am.
[288:29.78]Okay, you can tell, you can hear it here.
[288:31.52]This is like my butt dug into the chair and my head squished into my neck.
[288:40.96]It's that sound.
[288:41.95]Okay, remember this?
[288:49.07]What is this?
[288:49.87]Everything in this whole area.
[288:51.13]Oh no, no, oh no, no.
[288:53.17]I don't want to see this.
[288:54.61]Oh, this is going to be so stupid.
[288:55.85]I'm going to be so annoying.
[288:56.83]What was this from?
[288:59.78]Everything in this whole area.
[289:02.43]Everything in what whole area?
[289:03.55]Oh my god.
[289:06.47]Oh my god, look at how far away I am.
[289:08.97]This is from Dark Souls, I think.
[289:11.09]Fuck this weapon.
[289:12.47]Yeah.
[289:14.67]I think I played when I played Dark Souls earlier.
[289:16.03]You swing over everything.
[289:17.07]You only use that weapon.
[289:18.91]Only for a fucking boss.
[289:20.15]What a worthless weapon.
[289:21.05]What am I so angry at?
[289:22.03]Jesus Christ.
[289:24.41]You gotta be shit.
[289:26.00]I don't understand.
[289:26.52]Like, well, I'm very mad at something here.
[289:28.22]That had to have happened at some point earlier.
[289:30.74]Like, maybe like a few hours ago?
[289:32.44]Hmm.
[289:37.42]Interesting, I guess.
[289:38.12]I don't... I don't... Do I get... I don't think I got that mad.
[289:41.74]Maybe that might have been like a couple days ago.
[289:47.11]Well, it's all good.
[289:48.35]Thanks for that, whatever it was.
[289:53.17]What's this one?
[289:55.26]No, no, I don't want to see this.
[289:58.54]I'm not doing that again.
[290:01.06]We've already seen that video.
[290:02.28]Like, we've already seen that clip.
[290:06.12]Uh, thank you.
[290:08.40]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[290:10.94]Remember when you said you really wanted to use the ice cream whip?
[290:12.88]And I still do.
[290:14.48]I just have issues, you know what I mean?
[290:17.14]Like, when something goes wrong more than once or twice, it's over.
[290:21.09]Like, boom!
[290:22.27]The fucking dynamite goes off.
[290:24.59]And then I have to rebuild my whole house.
[290:31.13]I've got like a jalapeno head, you know what I mean?
[290:33.31]Like I just be- BOOM!
[290:35.38]And it takes months for me to repair.
[290:36.94]I have issues.
[290:47.62]I'm very explosive when I get angry at a video game.
[290:51.03]I don't break anything.
[290:52.13]I don't scream that loud.
[290:54.91]I just get like, boom.
[290:56.36]You know, I get like, bah!
[291:00.15]And then everything makes me angry.
[291:02.02]I looked over... Let me tell you something.
[291:03.34]I looked over here.
[291:06.68]At some point in the Blighttown situation, when I fell down, I looked over.
[291:10.78]There's a PlayStation 2 game sitting on my table.
[291:15.36]It's the Sopranos.
[291:16.78]It's just... It's Mr. Sopranos' face on the cover.
[291:19.64]And it pissed me off.
[291:21.76]I was like, don't look at me.
[291:23.44]It doesn't matter what it is.
[291:27.55]It's just like...
[291:30.32]And that's why you always hear me go, like, I gotta stop.
[291:32.58]I gotta get out of here.
[291:33.22]I gotta stop doing this.
[291:38.12]Because then it just spirals.
[291:39.64]And then something else happens.
[291:40.74]And then I lose control of that.
[291:42.09]And then I lose control of that.
[291:43.11]And all of a sudden, there is a bull in my house.
[291:49.55]Yeah, Tony Soprano made me fucking angry.
[291:51.69]And he had nothing to do with this.
[291:57.47]And then you go over it again in your head.
[291:59.11]You go over it.
[291:59.73]You go over it again.
[292:00.43]You go over it again in your head.
[292:03.00]Why the fuck is that enemy there?
[292:04.30]Why is that enemy there?
[292:05.62]Why did they decide to put that enemy there?
[292:07.34]And why did my swing not connect?
[292:08.68]And why is that enemy there?
[292:11.82]Boom.
[292:14.14]You analyze the same issue a hundred fucking times.
[292:22.53]He's an actual psycho.
[292:29.69]Give us your feelings when you realize I just died at the new Alondo boss no matter what.
[292:34.92]Oh, that was just, that was despair.
[292:36.80]That was an anger.
[292:37.48]Anger was already, remember, anger passed.
[292:41.21]I was in exhaustion.
[292:42.21]I was in despair.
[292:50.66]Hey Jeremy, remember when your World of Warcraft stream where you ran out of your house to Dunkin Donuts with the steam on and in your pajamas and somebody actually peed on stream?
[292:59.18]Wait, what?
[293:05.97]What are you talking about?
[293:07.01]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[293:16.04]What do you mean, proof?
[293:18.54]I don't believe this for a second.
[293:20.84]Yeah, we're gonna pop it on the runic brains.
[293:22.58]We gotta wait to pull for like two minutes.
[293:25.56]I think.
[293:25.88]Alright, I'm going to pee as we speak.
[293:27.82]Oh my god.
[293:28.20]Oh my god!
[293:29.23]No, no, no, no, no.
[293:30.81]No!
[293:31.65]No!
[293:32.45]No fucking way, dude.
[293:34.75]I just muted them all.

[294:10.82]Why did he have to say that?
[294:13.32]Why did he have to say, yeah, by the way, I'm going to pee as we speak.
[294:17.46]What are you thinking?
[294:18.32]Alright, I'm going to pee as we speak.
[294:21.43]Doesn't make sense.
[294:26.37]He brought his microphone into the bathroom specifically to fucking do that.
[294:33.37]That probably breaks terms of service.
[294:36.62]Oops.
[294:38.62]Anyways, thank you.
[294:43.74]Thank you, Kara Toby.
[294:45.10]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.

[295:21.62]I took out the censor bar so you can read it.
[295:23.25]This comic took me like four hours last night.
[295:25.83]I'd appreciate it if you read it.
[295:27.45]Since the picture came out kind of blurry thanks to a bad case of Mondays, here's a bigger version of me and my family.

[295:39.70]Let's read this.
[295:40.62]Okay, let's link it.
[295:45.01]Let's go through this together.
[295:50.49]Here is the latest comic script from Garfield.
[295:55.88]Garfield!
[295:58.80]The lady says, none of this makes any sense.
[296:01.10]That can't be how it happened.
[296:04.35]I wonder...
[296:06.49]chat will be talking about this one for a long time come on out everyone John goes over there gopher graph incoming and all the memes it's not enough that you Jermas chat with memes but you have to flood my house with them too these bit donations are going to get you banned one day what's the shark

[296:42.92]I'm liking it.
[296:46.94]And then here's a close-up of all the memes.
[296:49.64]There's a little man, like, dancing?
[296:53.79]Where did that even come from?
[296:58.63]Thank you, Garfield.
[297:00.89]For that latest Garfield comic book.

[297:46.89]You're really seeing them.
[297:48.77]This is not fucking around.
[297:50.17]I'm not just like kidding around here.
[297:52.87]I almost died right there.
[297:54.57]I almost died.
[297:57.51]This clip right here is you almost watched somebody die on Twitch.
[298:02.73]Like I almost died.
[298:06.29]This is true terror.
[298:15.86]You guys are getting every spectrum.
[298:19.72]And I can't hide it either.
[298:20.90]I don't... I'm not very... Listen.
[298:23.10]There's something you need to know about me.
[298:25.19]I cannot hide anything.
[298:27.53]If I'm upset, if I'm angry, if I'm happy, if I'm excited... I don't have... You're gonna hear it.
[298:33.67]You're gonna see it.
[298:35.35]I could be so fucking angry.
[298:36.93]I could be so scared.
[298:38.01]You're gonna know.
[298:50.46]You see the real me when I play Dark Souls.
[298:58.08]I hope you guys understand that.
[299:02.75]So for every like... I'm so fucking mad.
[299:05.97]This is so stupid.
[299:06.83]I hate this fucking game.
[299:08.05]I'm so done with this game.
[299:09.15]For every one of those.
[299:10.53]And for every like... Diarrhea that comes out when a monster almost hits me.
[299:17.18]Hopefully there's enough of the other side too.
[299:25.68]You want to see a real person?
[299:26.80]You want to see who somebody really is?
[299:29.13]Give them this game.
[299:30.73]And make them play it.
[299:31.51]Watch them play it.
[299:34.22]You want to ask your friend a real question?
[299:37.55]Get him super upset at Nito, at Dark Souls, and ask him anything you want and see what he says.
[299:44.19]God, fucking Nito is so dumb, man.
[299:45.99]What is with you?
[299:46.53]You run around in a circle?
[299:48.17]Why can I not fucking see?
[299:49.65]I can't fucking see.
[299:51.81]Hey, dude, did you say that you were going to try to talk to my sister and maybe date my sister?
[299:58.76]Dude, shut the fuck up.
[299:59.66]Yeah, I was.
[300:00.76]Yeah, I like your fucking sister.
[300:03.83]Shut the fuck up, dude.
[300:05.31]Fucking Nito sucks.
[300:07.96]You can get anything out of your friends.
[300:09.04]You can figure out anything.
[300:15.29]Like, you... Teachers should do... They should bring this into education.
[300:20.43]You want to find out if somebody cheated on a test?
[300:24.09]Get him to the dark zone in this game.
[300:26.85]Let him play through it and wait and watch.
[300:29.19]And when he gets to that point where he falls off the edge four times, ask him if he cheated.
[300:33.20]He'll give you the right answer.
[300:35.60]Yeah, I did.
[300:38.06]Yeah, I fucking cheated.
[300:39.34]This game sucks.
[300:39.98]I don't want to play it anymore.
[300:40.86]I cheated.
[300:45.06]It's the ultimate truth serum.
[300:51.28]Anyways.

[301:35.89]I just, okay, I said it.
[301:38.83]Thank you Stix Renegade for the one dollar.
[301:40.39]Fruit roll-ups, gushers, or fruit by the foot?
[301:44.95]That's, um... Come on.
[301:49.93]That's impossible.
[301:50.71]You can't make that decision.
[301:54.57]No, I can't make that decision.
[301:55.53]They're all my favorite children.
[301:57.72]You want... You're talking about, like, losing kids here.
[301:59.74]No.
[302:02.02]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[302:03.34]By the way, still in Orlando.
[302:04.62]Shake my head.
[302:05.40]Shake it.
[302:07.26]Thank you, Sir Feline, again, for the $1.
[302:08.72]When you get to Izalith, you will understand why people want them to change things.
[302:13.34]I'm telling you, I'm getting oxygen.
[302:14.88]I'm gonna get, like, a fucking... We're gonna do, like, essential oils.
[302:19.38]It's gonna be... I'm telling you, Thursday... Don't miss Thursday's stream.
[302:23.10]Don't do it.
[302:26.19]Like, if you want to make sure you watch a stream, watch, like, where I bring a bunch of, like, homeopathic remedies and, like, oxygen tanks and stuff to Thursday.
[302:35.44]I'm gonna see what I can do.
[302:39.58]That should be a fun one.
[302:42.20]Uh, but thank you, dude.
[302:43.16]Thank you to SurfyLen again.
[302:44.47]Now that you have a good PC, you could do a randomizer run for Dark Souls 2, including both enemies and items.
[302:50.99]Would be interesting to watch.
[302:54.30]Randomizer run?
[302:55.30]What does that mean?
[302:57.80]Is that like a mod for Dark Souls 2?
[302:59.21]I don't know.
[303:05.39]I'll look into it.
[303:07.13]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the $1.
[303:08.61]That's some tall talk about how Bloodborne would just be you going through the motions.
[303:12.81]Bloodborne speedrun stream when?
[303:16.54]Um... No, I'm not doing that shit.
[303:19.96]That's too hard.
[303:24.93]Like, I know where all the bosses are, I know what all the bosses do, I know where all the enemies are.
[303:29.04]No one's gonna pop out from behind a corner and, like, scare me.
[303:32.24]I'm gonna know where they are.
[303:33.00]I played through that game with seven different characters.
[303:40.48]I did a bunch of the Chalice Dungeon shit, it's just... It wouldn't be a stream that I would think would be very fun.
[303:47.72]Maybe for people that have never seen it before, or they like it, or seeing me play it in particular maybe, but... I would not want to do that on stream.
[303:57.18]But thanks, though.
[304:00.10]I don't know.
[304:00.94]Have we?
[304:02.00]I played it when it came out?
[304:07.25]Yes.
[304:08.13]I played Bloodborne when it came out.
[304:12.01]That sounds like a back down to me.
[304:13.53]Well, it is, because I'm not going to do it.
[304:17.96]Uh, thank you.
[304:18.80]Prime Vino for the $1.
[304:22.92]Talking about the P on stream.
[304:24.20]Thank you, dude.
[304:25.18]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[304:27.38]Fucking Nito sucks, LUL.
[304:30.60]No, Nito was fine.
[304:32.12]Nito was three attempts.
[304:33.40]He wasn't that bad.
[304:34.70]It was just... It was the area, and it's the area that I'm currently in.
[304:38.71]It's the area that I'm currently in, and I got to the end of, and I fell down a fucking well, and I can't even fight the boss.
[304:44.80]Because I need to go get a special ring to do it.
[304:46.79]That's where the anchor comes from.
[304:48.43]It doesn't come from Neato.
[304:56.94]But thank you.
[304:58.60]And the last two here.
[304:59.26]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.00.
[305:01.85]I enjoyed the Dark Souls stream even though there was a lot of rage.
[305:05.57]I often picture you in these moments sitting in a chair looking all sad and thinking, I could have been an independent wedding filmmaker and not have to put up with these Dark Souls bosses.
[305:14.16]The rage is real though.
[305:15.32]I recently started playing this game and yeah, I got mad.
[305:18.30]It almost puts you in a mood that you really don't want to be in, yet you still want to finish it.
[305:23.08]Odd situation.
[305:26.95]No, I love it though.
[305:33.17]You can't feel accomplished unless you don't accomplish these things, you know what I mean?
[305:39.01]Like, Dark Souls, for as much shit as I talk about it, it's my favorite game series ever.
[305:48.64]Like, how is that even possible?
[305:52.72]Dark Souls is probably my favorite ever franchise.
[305:58.05]The whole Soulsborne franchise ever.
[306:01.94]And, like, listen to some of the shit that I say about it.
[306:10.37]Is it still embarrassing getting mad on stream?
[306:14.33]No, not really.
[306:21.51]When Jeremy gets mad and starts talking shit about the game's design, I can't help but think of Tom Cruise's Why Would You Do That clip.
[306:33.74]I wouldn't call it embarrassing as much as I would call it... It's just frustrating.
[306:45.64]I don't get to a point though.
[306:47.64]I think the rage and the anger that I get in some of these games...
[306:55.37]It hits to that point where it starts to become, like, this is starting to get kind of bad, you shouldn't be this angry, and then I fall off the edge there, and I'm just like, ugh, whatever.
[307:07.58]I'm not one of those people that ever gets above that threshold where, this is fucking stupid, goddammit, ugh, this sucks!
[307:15.85]There are a lot of people that keep going and this sucks, this is stupid goes to like windows breaking and like rage quitting and screaming and I don't really do that.
[307:32.52]I get like silently angry and I get like complainy.
[307:39.54]I get real complainy when I get mad.
[307:43.83]No, no.
[307:44.19]Here's the thing I don't understand.
[307:45.56]Here's the thing that I don't understand.
[307:46.62]Let me know.
[307:46.90]Let me know.
[307:47.20]Here's the thing that I don't understand.
[307:50.36]No, answer me this.
[307:51.20]Answer me the question.
[307:51.92]Answer me this.
[307:59.36]And then I'd be quiet.
[308:01.90]Something that I just don't get.
[308:03.04]I just don't get this.
[308:04.22]Why would you... That's how it starts every time.
[308:15.24]Don't ever say that again.
[308:18.48]Whoa, that sounds just like Jerma985.
[308:27.05]And it's funny because, like, once I get there, let's say I get there and I look over at chat and somebody's like, oh, you're doing this so wrong.
[308:32.53]It's just like... Oh, come on.
[308:40.31]I'm fucking struggling here.
[308:42.68]Don't.
[308:48.58]Okay, let's go back to where we were.
[308:50.10]Like, when you're already having a problem, you're already, like, sucking, and you're already doing things wrong, and you look over, and people are like, holy shit, you're doing this so wrong, you suck.
[309:01.28]It's like, you don't think I know this at this point?
[309:08.32]And then, like, the steam starts brewing.
[309:20.80]I was just going to say that Colossus from the X-Men arcade game.
[309:25.36]Holy shit, you nailed it.
[309:27.53]Stapler, you nailed it.
[309:28.77]That's exactly what that was.
[309:33.33]What is this?
[309:34.03]Is this what I just did?
[309:36.44]Once I get there, let's say I get there and I look over a chat and somebody's like, oh, you're doing this so wrong.
[309:40.66]It's just like...
[309:45.78]Oh, come on.
[309:48.43]I'm fucking struggling here.
[309:55.07]That really is like changing gears.
[310:01.21]Alright.
[310:02.01]Last two.
[310:02.61]SirFeline, thanks for the $1 Jerma shameless plug for Lobos Jr.'
[310:07.35]'s content, but he does a lot of the randomizer runs and modded runs.
[310:10.57]Check him out.

[310:43.00]Have a good night.
[310:43.68]Take care everyone.
[310:44.52]See you soon.
[310:45.74]Much love.
[310:47.15]See you on Thursday.
[311:17.22]Thank you.
