[00:43.58]Fallout 4.
[00:44.88]Fallout 4.
[00:46.10]What was that intro?
[00:48.86]It was like the beginning of a PBS documentary that I just screwed up.
[00:53.07]Fallout 4.
[00:53.49]There's a game that was created by Bethesda Software.
[01:00.29]Takes place in Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:04.03]But something you don't know.
[01:09.44]Neither do I. Welcome to Fallout 4.
[01:20.45]Alright, I'll be back in two minutes.
[01:22.43]I just gotta get my shit going, you know?
[01:25.33]I'll be back in a minute.
[01:26.66]Starting soon.
[01:27.22]We're live.
[01:28.56]We're already live.
[01:29.92]Don't worry.
[01:57.39]Right when I fucking am about to send a tweet, my phone dies.
[02:00.22]Give me a second.
[02:00.96]God damn it.
[02:55.37]Wait, what?
[03:18.98]Dude, I don't know what it is about iPhones, but iPhone 6?
[03:21.72]I swear to God the thing is at 100% battery.
[03:26.35]And I'll sneeze.
[03:27.80]And it'll be at like 81.
[03:32.82]My review for iPhone 6?
[03:34.58]Fucking 4 out of 10.
[03:36.00]Nah, it's more like a 7 out of 10.
[03:39.24]Nah, it's like a 0.
[03:50.83]Let's open up Fallout.
[03:53.73]Should probably do this, shouldn't I?
[04:00.79]And... Would you look at that?
[04:07.95]This is gonna be loud.
[04:10.23]No, it isn't.
[04:13.09]I've played Fallout 4 before.
[04:14.11]I actually made a video on Fallout 4.
[04:17.31]But that was, like, I think the first... Maybe, like, couple, like, hours of the game.
[04:22.57]Like, the first, like, four or five hours of the game.
[04:24.33]I don't know.
[04:25.91]I could just, like, start from where I was.
[04:27.55]I don't even know where I'm gonna be.
[04:30.39]We could, like, skip the whole beginning.
[04:31.95]I'm not sure, what do you guys wanna do?
[04:34.95]You want me to just skip the whole fucking beginning?
[04:39.63]Just completely just don't even do the beginning, just go, like, seven hours into the game or something, however long I played.
[04:48.93]Turn it down, is it that loud?
[04:56.24]Make a new character?
[04:57.16]New skip, new skip, oh god.
[05:00.19]Skip, no skip, skip, no skip.
[05:02.88]This is like so torn.
[05:09.16]Yeah, is that better?
[05:11.26]Can you hear me?
[05:12.24]Make a pull.
[05:20.35]Alright, we might as well do a poll.
[05:22.29]Let's see what you guys want to do.
[05:23.91]This is just what I'm doing tonight.
[05:27.85]If it's fun, if I'm having a good time and you guys are enjoying it, then I'll definitely come back to it.
[05:34.34]But I did want to at least play.
[05:35.86]I never beat this game.
[05:37.12]I don't even fucking remember.
[05:40.26]I don't think I did.
[05:40.82]I think I got maybe a quarter of the way through the campaign.
[05:45.87]I just kind of didn't care anymore.
[05:52.23]Alright, are we... Hold on, let me just make sure that that's a possibility.
[05:58.02]Let's go to, like, load.
[06:00.08]Okay, so I've played for seven hours.
[06:02.24]Yeah, I knew I, like, played.
[06:06.34]So, like, should I just click this and just go for, like, seven hours into the story?
[06:10.13]Or into, like, the game?
[06:11.31]How long is the game?
[06:15.79]How... Is the story, like, 20 hours?
[06:17.35]Am I even halfway?
[06:18.15]What?
[06:21.80]Alright, let's see.
[06:22.66]Skip this.
[06:24.61]Let's go.
[06:24.91]Okay, we're going to go seven hours.
[06:29.55]Oh, Jesus.
[06:38.61]J.K.
[06:40.87]J.K.
[06:41.69]Fufu Irufu.
[06:45.50]Holy shit.
[06:47.46]He just gave me $200.
[06:50.92]Hello, Jerma.
[06:51.90]I'm from Australia and accidentally bought two 20,000 bits.
[06:55.20]I love your impulsiveness.
[06:56.36]Please never change.
[07:01.54]Thanks a lot, man.
[07:02.38]You accidentally bought $200,000 in bits?
[07:04.72]Well, I appreciate giving it to me.
[07:18.17]Thanks, man.
[07:20.18]Uh... I love you.
[07:23.00]I love y'all.
[07:24.30]Here comes the poll.
[07:26.34]I accidentally bought these bits.
[07:28.56]Ah, shit.
[07:29.18]What do I do with them?
[07:31.40]Oh, god.
[07:32.92]I haven't even started the stream.
[07:35.55]You don't know if it's worth $100 yet.
[07:38.23]You don't know if it's worth $100 yet.
[07:44.93]Oh, my goodness, dude.
[07:48.12]Aeronorth with another 100.
[07:51.40]10,000 bits from Aeronorth, 200,000 from jkfufuifufu.
[07:58.34]Thanks a lot, guys.
[08:00.21]Oops, I accidentally bought some more.
[08:01.81]Oh, looks like we're doing a new game, guys.
[08:10.11]I accidentally bought money.
[08:12.70]No, we haven't... Well, off to a start, I guess.
[08:17.01]But that means I gotta be really good tonight.
[08:21.55]That means I gotta be, like, super good.
[08:24.21]Really good.
[08:26.41]Can you tell my fists are in the air and I'm, like, putting my hand and fist together when I say that?
[08:33.09]Why did I just do that?
[08:36.67]Oh, you... You're fucking... You're crazy!
[08:39.36]He's crazy!
[08:41.52]Alright, looks like we're doing a new game.
[08:46.84]Just watched my voice acting demo from 2007.
[08:48.48]Well, that's an old one.
[08:52.61]That is an oldie, for sure.
[08:56.51]Thanks, Baked Flakes, though.
[08:57.39]Alright, we're gonna do a new game.
[09:00.33]I actually bought more bits.
[09:01.71]Thanks to all the subs that are coming here, too.
[09:05.13]Let's say I get a game loaded and all.
[09:07.58]Be graciously thankful.
[09:10.24]Stop avoiding his bad behavior.
[09:11.72]He was late.
[09:12.54]Speaking of late, I haven't even told anybody I was streaming on the Twitterverse.
[09:16.55]New game.
[09:17.99]Here comes like a cutscene, right?
[09:19.32]Alright.
[09:19.60]In the time it takes for the beginning cutscene, then I begin to make a tweet.
[09:25.02]Alright, here comes the cutscene.
[09:27.72]I think the game... No.
[09:28.90]Okay, we're good.
[09:29.68]Quiet.
[09:30.12]Shit, we're quiet.
[09:42.09]Uh.
[09:45.74]I don't think this is
[09:48.41]This isn't a cutscene.
[09:56.24]It's gonna happen in a minute.
[10:00.90]It's gonna happen.
[10:01.58]He's gonna say it.
[10:02.40]He's gonna say war.
[10:04.50]Here it comes.
[10:05.36]Yeah, remember my video?
[10:06.70]Hey, remember my video?
[10:07.44]I did this in the video.
[10:08.62]I went... War.
[10:11.07]We're gonna recreate my whole video.
[10:13.67]You guys wanna do that?
[10:15.31]That's what we're gonna do.
[10:15.85]I'm gonna try to recreate the whole video.
[10:30.07]Let's do soft.
[10:31.90]I already fucked it up.
[10:40.46]Remember that joke?
[10:42.67]That was a funny one, wasn't it?
[10:47.93]This is so silent.
[10:54.84]Actually, I think I may have skipped this cutscene when I first did it because I don't remember there being real people in this.
[10:58.72]I'm not laughing at Armageddon.
[11:03.40]I'm laughing at the fact that nobody can hear this.
[11:09.88]There's nothing I can do about it either.
[11:25.46]You guys have seen this already.
[11:26.38]You guys have seen this cutscene before.
[11:27.52]Don't worry.
[11:27.90]Look at these real actors.
[11:28.84]Here are the subtitles.
[11:31.56]I'll go get them.
[11:33.86]Escape.
[11:53.87]You guys already know the story.
[11:55.67]It's Fallout.
[12:00.75]Alright, did I pick a really bad time to, like, giggle at the fact that nobody can hear this?
[12:08.56]I probably did.
[12:14.36]Hey, who gives a shit about cutscenes when you got fucking 5,000 bits?
[12:21.12]Linker, thanks, man.
[12:23.55]I missed the Love Jerma with Bitstream last night, so I wanted to do my part.
[12:27.27]Oh, jeez.
[12:29.26]Well, thanks, man.
[12:29.94]I appreciate it.

[14:01.64]Why is it so silent?
[14:03.06]Hold on.
[14:04.62]Did he just say war never changes?
[14:10.64]Absolutely.
[14:11.16]This is still too low.
[14:20.07]Now get ready and stop hogging the mirror.
[14:22.83]Right.
[14:23.85]Okay.
[14:26.29]He actually does say that.
[14:27.25]Okay, well.
[14:29.77]Okay, face.
[14:37.96]It's a good start.
[14:41.23]That's a good start.
[14:41.93]That kind of looks like me.
[14:42.71]That kind of looks like my face.
[14:45.03]Yeah.
[14:45.37]Okay.
[14:45.65]Face.
[14:45.89]Okay.
[14:52.87]Kind of looks like me a little bit.
[14:58.48]A little bit bigger.
[14:59.04]Okay.
[15:01.06]That looks a little bit better.
[15:09.88]Okay, how about... Not bad.
[15:14.85]Not bad.
[15:17.41]Wait, let me change the type.
[15:21.97]Handsome.
[15:22.63]Which one of these handsome ones am I going to be?
[15:25.90]Make glue man?
[15:27.14]I could.
[15:27.98]I don't think I can, can I?
[15:35.42]You think my nose is too big?
[15:41.14]I haven't even done anything and I've somehow made him so strange looking.
[15:46.00]Should we make him like a pig man?
[15:50.12]No, let's make him like Mr. Magoo.
[15:58.09]I clean up pretty nice.
[16:05.59]Hold on.
[16:06.11]We've got to start at the top here.
[16:13.32]Creep.
[16:18.55]His eyes.
[16:19.29]It's his eyes.
[16:19.87]Stop looking at us like that.
[16:28.71]Do you guys look in the mirror like that?
[16:30.27]I don't.
[16:35.27]I don't even know if we can make Gloobin.
[16:37.57]Did you get a haircut?
[16:41.91]Let's try to make him a little bit bigger.
[16:43.73]It's not going to be possible.
[16:47.75]It's not possible, guys.
[16:49.59]If I do say so myself.
[16:54.95]He's going to have tiny ears.
[16:55.99]Alright.
[17:08.69]Let's do this right here.
[17:17.61]He just has a big bump on his head.
[17:18.94]He's like a big human baby.
[17:22.36]Hello, handsome.
[17:23.44]This looks like a baby.
[17:26.52]You know when a baby first comes out of the womb?
[17:28.71]That's what this looks like.
[17:38.47]Eyelids.
[17:40.82]Okay.
[17:41.82]Such pretty eyes.
[17:47.54]I'm gonna have a really deep-set brow.
[17:49.50]No, no, no, no.
[17:51.10]Yeah, of course we do.
[17:54.68]Yeah, not bad.
[18:06.86]This looks like normal, but from the side it looks insane.
[18:09.72]I love that face.
[18:20.31]Now he's turning into a Who from Whoville.
[18:22.63]Roguishly handsome or handsomely roguish?
[18:27.25]Okay.
[18:33.80]He's going to have a big jutting mouth.
[18:36.64]Such a great smile.
[18:39.42]He's going to have a tiny mouth.
[18:54.65]No, I don't like it.
[18:55.49]How do I, like, redo it?
[19:02.89]Wait, what?
[19:06.35]He's got, like, one of those big turkey necks.
[19:08.73]Good.
[19:09.11]What do you think, huh?
[19:10.39]Roguishly handsome or handsomely roguish?
[19:12.43]I don't know.
[19:13.59]We need to do it like this.
[19:22.08]He looks like some actor and I can't put my finger on who it is.
[19:24.72]How do I have him have frog eyes?
[19:27.77]Okay.
[19:27.95]Not bad.
[19:33.19]Not bad.
[19:33.63]Eyes.
[19:33.99]I want them to be more separate.
[19:56.45]Your eyes.
[19:56.97]Why can I not split them apart?
[19:57.91]That's the reason I said yes when you asked me out.
[20:03.75]I want to drop this.
[20:06.67]Let's turn this motherfucker into Voldemort.
[20:08.59]I clean up pretty nice.
[20:19.52]Get ready to be Voldemorted.
[20:21.60]Very strapping.
[20:30.67]It's just an alien now.
[20:32.41]That's all I've done.
[20:38.29]This new haircut's really working for me.
[20:40.57]Oh, God.
[20:41.15]Alright, I kind of like it.
[20:49.06]Although, we need to make sure we have... He's going to have a much bigger expression.
[20:56.87]Put his mouth down.
[20:57.83]There we go.
[21:09.22]And his chin needs to be like, stick it out.
[21:10.84]Alright, now I'm making like a colonial guy.
[21:16.42]Did all colonial people look like this?
[21:22.55]Yeah, not bad.
[21:24.73]He looks like he should be on like, currency.
[21:28.67]But somebody accidentally smashed his face in with an iron before they took the picture.
[21:35.56]Like, there's the iron.
[21:36.42]Like, right here's the perfect spot for the iron to be.
[21:38.47]There's the bottom of the iron.
[21:39.33]It was coming in front to back.
[21:46.13]I do love those lips.
[21:47.33]I really want to fuck up his, uh... No, that's fine.
[21:52.21]Wait a minute, what about this?
[21:56.60]Oh, goodness.
[22:00.52]No, I like... No, actually, that's good.
[22:02.56]That's more like presidential, you know what I mean?
[22:14.23]Can I move these down?
[22:15.31]Yeah, I can.
[22:18.65]This guy is fucking terrifying.
[22:22.80]Maybe just a huge... No, I don't like that.
[22:31.30]I was looking... Yeah, Sean has your smile.
[22:35.16]Yeah, big top mouth.
[22:41.33]How dare you look at me like that in my wife?
[22:51.67]Looking good, if I do say so myself.
[22:53.91]He's turning into a Simpsons character.
[23:00.90]Alright, that's gonna be tidy.
[23:05.70]Okay, we need a snootier haircut.
[23:11.31]Is this a snooty haircut?
[23:15.45]Where's the president?
[23:18.03]This one's pretty presidential, I think.
[23:19.81]Yeah, we're just gonna make this white.
[23:23.83]And we made, like, Andrew Jackson.
[23:29.85]Okay, this is going to be white.
[23:34.43]We made one of the founding fathers of The Simpsons.
[23:38.69]Nice haircut.
[23:42.17]Like from the front, not so much, but like when I do this, that's a dollar bill.
[23:46.65]That's the $1 bill.
[23:47.19]That's the $5 bill.
[23:47.85]No, that's the $20 bill.
[23:48.69]I think we're good.
[24:00.89]Beethoven.
[24:01.61]Let's take a look at one more.
[24:10.65]What do you think, huh?
[24:12.11]Okay, this is John Kerry.
[24:16.36]That's just our Secretary of State, our current Secretary of State, John Kerry.
[24:23.86]That's how he's on the one-bit bill.
[24:29.58]What do you think?
[24:30.00]Like this?
[24:31.06]John Kerry?
[24:37.09]What else we got?
[24:40.67]I don't know.
[24:43.64]It's either John Kerry or the $4 bill.
[24:48.80]What do you guys think?
[24:52.10]I clean up pretty nice.
[24:55.60]Alright, we're gonna go with the fucking... They're both very presidential and very old school.
[25:03.48]It's just so odd.
[25:04.72]Alright, we're gonna... Let's see, what else?
[25:11.74]We gotta make him have like a powdered face, right?
[25:14.90]Can we do that?
[25:15.90]Can we have him have like the old powdered wig and like powdered man?
[25:21.16]That's as light as we can get.
[25:22.90]That's my handsome guy.
[25:24.54]How do I... Can I edit her?
[25:27.43]What's this facial hair bullshit?
[25:28.97]This is a founding father.
[25:38.03]I don't know.
[25:38.57]I don't know if I like it.
[25:39.81]I don't know if I want this.
[25:46.45]Hello, handsome.
[25:49.71]No, okay, this one.
[25:51.95]Yeah, ready?
[25:53.00]You go from presidential to like fucking murder me.
[25:58.36]Like, this is the guy behind Cell.
[26:00.64]You open up a Cell door, this guy's there.
[26:02.58]President.
[26:03.96]Cell door.
[26:05.54]President of the United States.
[26:07.26]In the Cell door.
[26:09.60]Secretary of State.
[26:11.56]Guy that just got arrested.
[26:12.66]Thrown in the drunk tank.
[26:14.44]Alright, I'm done.
[26:14.87]Let's go.
[26:15.13]We're going back to the other one.
[26:21.09]This one.
[26:30.97]Alright, it's done.
[26:32.23]We're done.
[26:36.34]Oh god, he's fucking creepy.
[26:37.70]Alright, how do I say yes?
[26:42.28]Uh, extras.
[26:44.92]Damage.
[26:47.23]It's a huge scar.
[26:48.89]When the founding fathers founded America, they got into civil war and they got big scars on their face.
[26:58.72]He's gonna-
[27:04.67]He's like all beat up.
[27:09.23]No, no, he's clean.
[27:10.85]He's completely clean cut.
[27:13.28]Except he might have a couple of zits.
[27:19.74]Just acne John Kerry.
[27:26.25]Rough face.
[27:30.23]Eye socket shade.
[27:33.74]You can edit your wife?
[27:34.76]Well, I'm gonna edit the girl too.
[27:39.34]Markings.
[27:40.08]No, we don't need any of these.
[27:41.02]No.
[27:45.36]Okay.
[27:47.08]So, body.
[27:52.14]Just like a jacked founding father.
[27:54.18]I want to make him fat.
[27:55.12]Everybody has to be a fat guy, but that doesn't make any sense.
[28:01.94]No, that doesn't look good either.
[28:03.18]Oh, God.
[28:04.79]Should he just be huge?
[28:09.21]Jacked John Kerry?
[28:14.65]How about an in-between?
[28:15.39]Yeah, he'll be, like, fucking stacked.
[28:19.22]I already made a beer.
[28:25.56]Founding beer.
[28:28.48]No, I don't like the skeleton bit.
[28:32.26]This is a founding father we're talking about.
[28:35.34]This is Andrew Jackson.
[28:36.56]You see how huge Andrew Jackson was?
[28:39.77]He was fucking enormous.
[28:43.75]We'll go in between here.
[28:45.23]We'll have like Andrew Jackson like on a good day.
[28:47.05]This is Andrew Jackson on like a bad day.
[28:48.97]This is like a normal Andrew Jackson.
[28:53.15]Okay, that's good.
[28:54.95]So how do I... How do I change her?
[29:00.88]Can I?
[29:07.80]Is there a way I can... Do I have to change, like, sex to change her?
[29:10.18]Oh, okay.
[29:19.79]Alright, so that was Andrew Jackson.
[29:24.96]No, that was like... Okay, so we have to make... She's going to be a Bia.
[29:29.88]Absolutely.
[29:30.58]We're going to make a Bia.
[29:32.42]A Bia wife.
[29:40.52]Hmm, let's see.
[29:44.82]Who should I choose?
[29:46.12]We'll start with this one.
[29:47.60]Alright, so Bia's got big, big, big chins.
[29:55.66]And they got big fat necks.
[30:05.56]Not bad.
[30:06.96]Not bad.
[30:07.78]Not bad at all.
[30:13.33]She's starting to already look like a Disney villain.
[30:17.87]It's Cruella de Vil.
[30:29.37]They both have to have the same mouth.
[30:37.64]Make Ursula?
[30:38.78]Yeah, she looks like a Disney character.
[30:43.47]Such a cute nose.
[30:50.44]It's gonna be bigger.
[30:52.26]No, it's gonna be like that.
[30:53.70]And then scale it this way.
[30:56.88]I think Sean has your nose.
[31:12.22]Up.
[31:12.94]Go up higher.
[31:17.16]I'm going to lower the ears.
[31:20.36]There we go.
[31:22.86]This has got to be wide.
[31:24.34]Wide as all hell.
[31:25.50]I don't know if I like the... She already has the turkey neck.
[31:35.56]Let's make her have a tiny head.
[31:46.55]That looks nice.
[31:47.31]Right there.
[31:51.44]No, she's going to have like the other way eyes like that.
[31:58.98]You do know you've got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
[32:05.76]She wouldn't have tiny eyes, wouldn't have huge bug eyes.
[32:09.17]That's odd.
[32:09.67]I think Sean has my eyes.
[32:16.78]I want these to be up.
[32:23.44]Jesus.
[32:25.62]Such a great smile.
[32:27.20]Alright, let's play with the hair.
[32:31.60]We're going to change the hair.
[32:38.29]Deep red, brown, dark brown.
[32:42.13]Now she's graying, she's graying.
[32:43.35]I swear.
[32:49.63]That's going to be higher than that.
[32:53.67]Absolutely lovely.
[32:56.39]And then that shrinks.
[32:58.01]They both kind of have similar... It actually really is turning into a witch.
[33:08.48]Can I make these any bigger?
[33:09.54]No.
[33:11.69]What is the sun going to look like?
[33:12.91]Yeah, that works.
[33:20.80]Tiny ears.
[33:24.98]Shit, the little kid's gonna be Robbie Rotten.
[33:27.10]You're beautiful, you know that?
[33:30.73]Robbie Rotten.
[33:31.85]That's so strange.
[33:38.19]I'm making a very strange person.
[33:40.27]There's no limits to how many scars and blemishes you can add.
[33:42.55]I have to look at this for the rest of the game.
[33:53.76]You have great lips.
[33:55.02]You know that?
[33:59.26]What about this?
[33:59.82]She's going to have a big bottom lip.
[34:03.62]That's her thing.
[34:04.65]Yeah, that works.
[34:11.35]And one more thing with the mouth full.
[34:13.13]We want it to be as big and wide as possible going up.

[35:08.99]There we go.
[35:09.95]Yeah, I like that.
[35:11.59]That's much better.
[35:20.97]The contrast between these two.
[35:23.16]Ah, look at those eyes.
[35:25.05]No, this has to be up higher than this.
[35:30.17]Here we go.

[36:26.01]No, the wife, she's got to be fucking stacked.
[36:30.27]Like that, like they both got to be fucking just, just fucking a stack of shit, both of them.
[36:38.66]It's like a beetle.
[36:43.86]It really is like a stag beetle.

[43:56.04]Whatever this is, is what I'm doing.
[43:57.00]I don't even know what it is.
[44:00.24]We're about to find out.
[44:04.69]That was not found.
[44:06.51]Wasn't found.
[44:11.73]Player placed at me.
[44:12.57]We'll try this one.
[44:20.65]Okay, I don't know what that did.
[44:22.81]Who is going to be inside of our house?
[44:29.98]No, honey!
[44:31.02]Oh my god!
[44:36.46]How did he get in here?
[44:42.49]What happens if... What happens if... How do I fight him?
[44:45.65]How do I fight him?
[44:49.07]They're gonna call the police!
[44:50.36]Call the police, use the phone!
[44:52.48]That's not a phone, that's a thermostat.

[45:21.77]God's work.
[45:23.93]Wow, that was fucked up.
[45:28.59]Oh, what does this one want to do?
[45:33.23]I want to do this one first.
[45:34.37]Let's see what this one... Okay, we're going to go with this random person in the chat.
[45:37.11]I don't know what this is going to do.
[45:38.87]We have it saved.
[45:39.47]Don't worry.
[45:40.13]We're just doing some fucking tests.
[45:42.14]We're doing a little bit of scientific tests.
[45:45.06]What?
[45:45.98]Can I help you?
[45:48.57]Hold on, is this the guy that comes to the door?
[45:55.11]This guy comes to the door.
[45:57.55]What happens if he sees himself?
[45:58.61]Isn't this some weird, like, paradox time thing?
[46:01.22]Where if you see yourself in an alternate timeline or dimension, you instantly die?
[46:06.36]Can I help you?
[46:08.74]Well, there, okay.
[46:13.04]Here he comes.
[46:14.67]Can you get that?
[46:16.03]It's probably that salesman.
[46:17.59]He comes for you every day.
[46:22.49]Okay, let's answer the door.
[46:23.83]Come on in.
[46:24.71]Good morning.
[46:26.47]Calling.
[46:29.52]Can I help you?
[46:31.46]God, I wish I could get him to go over there.
[46:35.22]Hello?
[46:40.01]Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.
[46:42.02]Oh, no worries, sir.
[46:44.82]I'm not selling anything.
[46:46.34]Not today.
[46:51.44]You can't begin to know how happy I am to finally speak with you.
[46:55.50]I've been trying for days.
[46:57.37]It's a matter of utmost urgency.
[47:03.25]Fuck, it's already started.
[47:04.39]I can't stop doing this now.
[47:08.75]Alright, let's go.
[47:09.73]We have to get out of the fucking house.
[47:11.85]We have to get out of the house.
[47:29.17]Does he come to the door still?
[47:32.59]How do I get out of this fucking mode?
[47:37.65]It's already begun.
[47:43.46]I'm stuck in the house, guys.
[47:49.90]Am I stuck in the house?
[47:55.31]Where's the guy that I need to see?
[47:58.31]How do I get away from the camera?
[48:01.11]What's like the zoom out thing?
[48:02.33]There he is.
[48:02.63]There he is.
[48:02.93]There he comes.
[48:08.20]He's gonna ring the doorbell, and I'm gonna be able to answer the door.
[48:09.80]I'm standing right here.
[48:14.53]Ooh, I just quick-saved.
[48:21.37]I'm in the water?
[48:24.19]Okay, where is he?
[48:25.33]Let me get... Oh, I'll get that.
[48:26.61]I'll answer the door.
[48:28.65]It's probably that salesman again.
[48:31.37]Which one?
[48:31.69]Oh, there's my house.
[48:32.29]I forgot where my house was.
[48:33.93]Yeah, hold on, sir.
[48:34.71]Yeah, you were looking for me?
[48:37.82]I'm the guy that's in the grass over here.
[48:39.48]Let me just get the door real quick.
[48:44.46]Alright.
[48:44.97]Open the door.
[48:47.67]Give me two seconds.
[48:52.93]This is a game in itself to trying to answer the door.
[48:57.67]What's with the breathing?
[48:58.49]There it is.
[49:01.29]Come on.
[49:01.89]Get my cursor on it.
[49:04.97]I had it.
[49:05.85]Almost got it.
[49:06.89]Almost got it.
[49:08.03]One more second and I should have it.
[49:13.33]Oh, you fucker.
[49:14.01]Come on.
[49:14.53]Alright, I'm in first person.
[49:19.33]Let's make it easier.
[49:23.74]Okay, I got it.
[49:28.14]It's not opening.
[49:29.42]The door is not opening.
[49:34.55]Alright, hello.
[49:37.80]What am I doing?
[49:38.46]I'm drowning?
[49:39.14]How am I drowning?
[49:42.54]Alright, what's the thing where I can move the camera away, not this?
[49:48.40]TCL, what's the thing where I can move the camera?
[49:52.18]I'm drowning in the house.
[49:54.87]I want to, like, get the camera away.
[50:02.95]TFC?
[50:07.39]There it is.
[50:22.73]He's dead.
[50:23.68]He's dead.
[50:28.48]Okay, that's game over.
[50:30.42]Game over.
[50:30.84]We lose.
[50:31.32]Okay.
[50:37.54]The game crashed.
[50:39.38]It's over.
[50:41.54]I just did TFC and the game exploded.
[50:43.74]Okay.
[50:48.39]That works.
[50:48.93]Let me open up the game again.
[50:51.53]I haven't even answered the door.
[51:00.76]I haven't even answered the door.
[51:02.26]That's the best part.
[51:03.04]I haven't even started the game.
[51:04.66]Can I even play through?
[51:05.70]Continue?
[51:06.36]Like, I don't even know.
[51:06.98]Load?
[51:09.01]Thank God.
[51:10.83]Because quicksave is me like 40 feet tall.
[51:15.06]Alright, we're here.
[51:16.10]Confirm this one.
[51:17.80]We're not even one minute into the game.
[51:25.37]I'm going to answer the door.
[51:26.01]Wait, let's get out of here.
[51:38.40]Please stand by.
[51:39.24]I hope I didn't break the whole thing.
[51:43.30]See, we're good.
[51:43.80]We're fine.
[51:44.38]We got it out of our system.
[51:45.96]I drowned in my house as a big guy and died and just closed my eyes in front of the salesman.
[51:52.77]Let's actually do a thing.
[51:54.45]Let's move forward in the story and progress.
[51:58.39]I gotta go say, oh, hello.
[52:00.37]That scared me.
[52:06.34]Hasn't even set player scale 0.1?
[52:07.60]Hold on, do you turn into a mouse?
[52:08.70]Oh, hold on.
[52:09.00]Guys, I'm sorry.
[52:09.54]What was it?
[52:10.04]It was player set scale 0.1.
[52:11.60]Oh, whoops.
[52:12.16]Player set scale 0.1.
[52:41.52]I'm too... Okay.
[52:44.76]This is just Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.
[52:55.12]I'm too small.
[52:55.90]I can't even fit in the... No, I'm too small.
[53:04.17]I'm going as fast as I can.
[53:06.83]I need to be up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[53:10.01]Get up here.
[53:12.32]See, now I should be able to float over to the door when he answers, I guess.
[53:21.13]What am I doing?
[53:21.93]I'm praying my way.
[53:25.15]I'm going up to the rapture to touch this door.
[53:27.07]Oh, dear.
[53:30.99]Okay.
[53:31.33]Okay.
[53:46.12]I gotta get to the door!
[53:49.52]I can't even see the door, though.
[53:52.04]The door's not even openable.
[53:53.12]Once the door's openable, it'll be great.
[53:58.76]Who's trying to shoot me?
[53:59.58]Why do I have my hands up?
[54:02.48]Hold on, I'll get that door.
[54:03.78]Please don't shoot me!
[54:05.49]...continues to rise.
[54:07.39]Tensions with China reach an all-time high.
[54:11.52]Everyone's kind of frozen.
[54:12.64]Wait, sit.
[54:13.42]Okay, I'm sitting.
[54:14.48]Oh, no.
[54:14.62]No, not anymore.
[54:15.10]Too small.
[54:15.70]I don't think the game even realizes that I'm alive.
[54:19.60]The guy hasn't come to the door yet.
[54:39.17]This is what happens when you get, like, a guy in front of a shitty green screen.
[54:42.86]Look at me, I'm running away from, like, the 50-foot-tall woman!
[54:46.28]Okay, so let's do TCL.
[54:52.56]Alright.
[54:54.50]Okay, he's at the door.
[55:00.03]No, no, what am I doing?
[55:13.04]Get me.
[55:16.06]Alright, open the door.
[55:24.70]TCL.
[55:26.40]There he is.
[55:26.78]Am I on the couch?
[55:38.89]Alright, let's get back to normal size.
[55:40.09]Fuck this.
[55:44.47]No, no, no.
[55:45.13]Player set scale.
[55:48.62]Let's go to... Point like five.
[55:51.56]Let's just get back to normal.
[55:57.61]Alright, that's not normal necessarily, but it's normal enough.
[56:02.65]Remind me again?
[56:03.71]He's like a little baby person.
[56:05.51]And helping secure your future.
[56:07.57]You see, Vault-Tec is the foremost builder of state- He is looking down, too.
[56:11.75]That's a credit.
[56:12.13]Look, he's looking down.
[56:14.03]Vaults, if you will.
[56:16.20]Luxury accommodations where you can wait out the horrors of nuclear devastation.
[56:20.38]It's like little Timmy answering the door.
[56:22.10]You can't begin to know how happy I am to finally speak with you.
[56:25.64]Okay.
[56:26.12]I've been trying for days.
[56:27.98]It's a matter of utmost urgency, I assure you.
[56:37.53]What's so important?
[56:38.63]Why do I keep turning around?
[56:39.41]Nothing less than your entire future.
[56:41.85]If you haven't noticed, this country has gone to heck in a handbasket.
[56:47.70]Let me go get my Bobby.
[56:48.72]Hold on.
[56:49.64]The big kaboom is... It's inevitable, I'm afraid.
[56:54.78]And coming sooner than you may think.
[56:57.02]Let me go get my Bobby and Daddy.
[56:59.83]Yeah.
[57:00.35]I just- I just did- learned how to do geometry.
[57:02.39]I know how to make a triangle.
[57:05.39]Yes.
[57:06.33]Is that- does that look like a triangle?
[57:29.00]Why do I keep doing this?
[57:30.12]My guy's just looking presidential.
[57:32.06]That's all he's doing.
[57:32.94]Oh, okay.
[57:33.22]Why does my guy keep spinning around?
[57:35.34]These jumps are so high!
[58:00.36]Alright.
[58:01.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[58:02.30]I... I need to go back to normal and make sure this isn't going to break everything.
[58:18.75]No.
[58:19.59]Not doing that this time.
[58:20.43]I am going to do 10 luck.
[58:25.37]That is for sure.
[58:25.93]That's certain.
[58:30.22]Should I do 10 luck, 10 charisma and have my character suck ass again?
[58:35.74]We already did this in the last game.
[58:39.15]Last time I did this, I specifically remember a scenario where I was complaining the whole stream how bad the character was and how I couldn't kill anyone.
[58:45.61]You're supposed to be strong.
[58:58.59]Am I actually going to do this one perception?
[59:04.60]Charisma's useless.
[59:07.24]No, we're not doing that again.
[59:08.32]Sorry, guys.
[59:10.60]I'll do 10 luck, but I have to at least not be a total fucking idiot.
[59:17.02]Because I'll be like a crit character.
[59:18.54]20 strength.
[59:25.70]Should I be melee?
[59:26.32]No, I tried to do that last time.
[59:28.42]I want to be like pistol guy.
[59:33.32]One in everything.
[59:34.00]Oh my goodness, that would be so awful.
[59:39.73]Zero strength.
[59:41.55]No, I want to be pistol guy.
[59:44.63]Think presidential.
[59:45.49]You know, that's true.
[59:46.27]That's true.
[59:52.81]If I was president...
[59:56.39]I would have to be.
[59:56.99]I'd be strong.
[59:58.67]I'd have perception.
[60:01.09]I'd have charisma.
[60:01.89]These would all be 10.
[60:03.11]Sorry.
[60:09.01]We'll do it with perception.
[60:10.37]Where is it?
[60:10.93]Agility.
[60:14.95]Fuck charisma.
[60:15.61]I'll be a piece of shit and nobody will like me.
[60:18.33]I don't care.
[60:26.18]I'm okay with this.
[60:27.40]No, like that.
[60:29.04]That's fine.
[60:29.54]I got a little bit more intelligence.
[60:30.66]We got some good perception.
[60:33.88]Make a super smart wimp.
[60:38.54]No, I want to actually be able to kill things.
[60:45.03]We've been live for an hour.
[60:47.25]Can you fucking believe that shit?
[60:49.39]I've been live for an hour.
[60:51.99]We even got out the front door of the house.
[60:54.15]That's unbelievable.
[60:59.86]We'll do one more in charisma.
[61:01.54]No.
[61:02.42]One more in intelligence.
[61:03.80]I'm extremely smart.
[61:07.38]Good enough?
[61:08.84]It's good enough.
[61:09.78]Let's go.
[61:10.30]Accept.
[61:15.47]Uh, what?
[61:16.67]You must name your character before... Oh.
[61:24.01]I just took a screenshot, apparently.
[61:25.37]Somehow, by hitting J. Okay.
[61:44.96]Andrew Jackery.
[61:57.97]There we go.
[61:58.69]Andrew Jackery Jacked.
[62:05.25]I need to do set scale because this is going to break and this is not going to be good.
[62:10.61]One.
[62:10.75]Why am I going so slow?
[62:11.87]What did I do?
[62:28.37]Okay, we're back to normal.
[62:34.02]A little baby jump, I know.
[62:37.00]Alright, we can finally leave the door.
[62:38.72]Oh, go take care of her.
[62:45.00]Don't worry Fodsworth, whatever his name is.
[62:50.93]Stay tiny.
[62:51.59]I need to at least get out of the house.
[62:53.39]I can go back to tiny as long as it's not going to break the game.
[62:57.67]How are the two most important men in my life doing?
[63:01.11]Spin the mobile a bit.
[63:02.41]He loves that.
[63:05.11]Jesus.
[63:06.97]Okay, let me save it so I know it's not going to break.
[63:12.64]And now... We're going to set scale to 0.4.
[63:17.04]If it works, I will be tiny guy for as long as I can.
[63:32.23]Alright, this works.
[63:37.94]I can't walk by my wife now.
[63:43.92]Can I actually play with the baby like this?
[63:57.26]Hey, how's my little guy?
[63:59.80]Much better now.
[64:00.40]I don't know.
[64:00.68]Which one are you talking about?
[64:01.94]Listen, after breakfast, I was thinking we could head to the park for a bit.
[64:05.93]Weather should hold up.
[64:08.79]Yeah, sounds like fun.
[64:10.59]Sir, Mom, you should come and see this.
[64:14.99]Codsworth, what's wrong?
[64:16.25]I love this so much.
[64:20.56]Let's go.
[64:21.14]We're going to go see what's wrong.
[64:22.10]Wait, what?
[64:25.99]Why am I so slow?
[64:27.51]Oh, no.
[64:29.25]It's on the couch.
[64:30.41]We need to see what's going on.
[64:33.11]Is there a nuclear attack?
[64:36.19]Oh, no.
[64:37.85]Cap's luck.
[64:38.57]My God.
[64:59.68]Tiny legs.
[65:00.52]We gotta get to the vault.
[65:08.92]We gotta get to the vault now!
[65:12.74]Go!
[65:12.84]Quick!
[65:13.28]Run!
[65:13.46]Shit, I really am slower because I have smaller legs.
[65:16.75]This is not gonna end well.
[65:29.37]Am I losing more stamina because I'm smaller?
[65:33.71]Should I be able to sprint?
[65:37.46]Sprint?
[65:37.90]Should I build a sprint for longer than that?
[65:46.78]He's running out of breath because he has smaller lungs.
[65:53.53]Help these people.
[65:56.15]I can't move, please.
[65:57.95]That'll be all I have left.
[66:06.25]Go!
[66:07.65]Go!
[66:08.15]This is so much more anti-climactic like this.
[66:15.11]Spawn a Deathclaw.
[66:16.11]Alright, what happens if I spawn a Deathclaw?
[66:20.60]While we're going in.
[66:24.02]Look at Nuke.
[66:31.87]Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay.
[66:34.64]I'm reporting this!
[66:37.06]If you're in the program, step forward.
[66:38.94]Otherwise, return home.
[66:39.50]I'm in the program.
[66:41.96]Me and my family are in the program.
[66:44.00]We're on the list.
[66:44.80]We're gonna die!
[66:46.16]Infant, adult male, adult female.
[66:49.67]Thank you.
[66:52.23]Thank you.
[66:53.27]Good luck, ma'am.
[66:54.45]And God help us all.
[66:55.29]You two, follow me.
[66:56.21]Come on!
[66:56.87]What's gonna happen to all those people outside of me?
[66:58.89]Everything we can.
[66:59.82]Now keep moving.
[67:08.77]Set higher speed.
[67:11.87]Alright, wait a minute.
[67:12.45]This is important.
[67:19.00]No, no, no.
[67:19.52]I wouldn't be able to just get in there.
[67:26.20]Step on the platform.
[67:27.80]Okay, hold on.
[67:29.38]Save it right here.
[67:29.96]Is there a quick save?
[67:32.88]What is it?
[67:33.26]F4?
[67:33.56]F5?
[67:34.94]Now, what is the deathclaw?
[67:36.75]I'm curious as to...
[67:39.80]So I'm going to give me the deathclaw, because I'm going to spawn it as I'm going in here.
[67:42.41]I don't know what this one is, but there's going to be like 11 of them.
[68:01.57]Oh shit, there's too many things there.
[68:02.79]Alright, here we go.
[68:04.39]Whatever this is, there's going to be at least a couple of them.
[68:11.45]Saved right here, everything's normal, everything's fine.
[68:15.32]And here we go.
[68:26.23]What the fuck are these things?
[68:28.41]I can't move.
[68:33.21]What the fuck?
[68:34.79]No, I need to make- I need to spawn it, like, back here.
[68:37.72]And then run.
[68:43.00]Spawn it here, and then sprint.
[68:46.75]Ready?
[68:46.97]We're gonna do one.
[68:48.11]Three is way too many.
[68:49.85]Okay, and... Go!
[69:02.55]I couldn't even do it and move.
[69:05.19]Ready?
[69:05.53]And...
[69:21.45]Get down here!
[69:22.13]Where's my wife?
[69:24.17]Where's my wife?
[69:24.85]She's just holding the baby?
[69:27.31]Get us down!
[69:30.91]Oh my god, and I can't move.
[69:35.75]Get on the platform, honey!
[69:38.49]Don't you see what's happening?
[69:40.11]There's a nuclear explosion about to happen.
[69:44.89]This guy's just throwing rocks.
[69:51.21]Okay, he's gonna come over to me.
[69:53.87]Oh no!
[69:56.89]How is this guy still alive?
[70:01.08]What is that shotgun noise that I keep hearing?
[70:03.66]I'm blocked.
[70:07.06]I'm just sitting over there with the baby.
[70:10.60]They don't care about this.
[70:13.73]I don't think either one of these guys can die.
[70:18.81]I'm pretty sure like nothing can die so we're gonna spawn like respond like fucking whatever this is we're gonna spawn like ten of them I'm just taking random shit from the chat by the way like I don't even know what this is, but it's gonna be five little Perk rank zero
[70:45.01]What the fuck did that just do?
[70:47.26]What did that guy just do?
[70:52.82]I have no idea what that guy just did.
[71:02.92]Get the deathclaw and then we're moving on because these guys all can't die.
[71:06.08]Oh God, the chat is moving so fast.
[71:14.99]I missed it.
[71:17.03]I didn't get it.
[71:20.39]Pranked.
[71:23.07]Look up.
[71:29.13]What?
[71:36.80]Who was the guy that was walking by?
[71:41.49]Alright, well, never mind.
[71:42.61]A bunch of guys holding warheads?
[71:48.96]Almost there.
[71:49.70]We're gonna be okay.
[71:51.52]I love you.
[71:52.60]Both of you.
[71:53.22]We love you, too.
[71:57.45]Oh, my God!
[72:03.53]God damn it!
[72:05.23]It was those stupid things!
[72:07.87]No!
[72:19.49]Ah, those stupid dumb things.
[72:20.83]I'm back to being small.
[72:25.85]Stop enabling him.
[72:26.77]Whoa!
[72:26.89]Remember when that happened?
[72:55.79]Go smaller.
[72:56.45]I can't go smaller than this.
[73:05.48]Any smaller than this and it would be unbearable.
[73:08.56]Alright, now I gotta increase my speed.
[73:12.78]Let me do... 0.5 is fine.
[73:13.26]I'll do 0.5.
[73:23.48]And then player, what is it, speed?
[73:27.95]How do I go, like, a little bit faster?
[73:30.11]SetAVSpeedMult.
[73:32.85]Player.SetAVSpeedMult.
[73:38.66]Let's go with 200.
[73:41.09]There we go.
[73:41.43]Just like a... like a halfling.
[73:42.29]Go up the stairs.
[73:42.69]Everybody from East Rim fucking blasted.
[73:44.01]Up the stairs.
[73:44.63]Get up those fucking stairs.
[74:11.89]I don't know how much longer I can take being small.
[74:17.40]This is like freaking me out.
[74:18.62]It's hard to even look at objects.
[74:32.50]Ah, doctor.
[74:33.08]Do they even have my size?
[74:34.10]I'm not sure.
[74:34.64]Do you guys have, like, tiny baby man?
[74:36.58]What size would this even be?
[74:37.48]This is like joke size.
[75:00.34]I'm a, uh, you know those big action figures?
[75:03.53]That they're not quite lifelike?
[75:07.21]They're small enough where, like Batman, for instance.
[75:10.43]I'm just one of those, I'm a to-life Batman joke, life-size, not life-size action figure.
[75:15.43]Fun-sized.
[75:15.99]Do set skill like two and be like a big guy?
[75:18.19]Let's try that one.
[75:18.91]Let's do like 1.7.
[75:41.53]I'm like too tall to walk through.
[75:42.87]Just like Andre the Giant now.
[75:43.89]Am I gonna fit in one of these?
[75:44.97]Excuse me.
[75:45.27]Okay.
[76:09.25]Alright, there we go.
[76:11.13]Get into the decontamination unit.
[76:15.06]My arms are way bigger.
[76:15.84]I didn't even put the suit on.
[76:18.72]Where am I?
[76:19.06]I'm not even in there.
[76:19.62]What?
[76:38.17]That's bullshit.
[76:51.64]First person nobody.
[76:54.21]Time for a whole new life.
[76:58.83]I'm in third person.
[76:59.71]I'm freezing.
[77:04.43]Spawning ten dog mates?
[77:18.79]and a deathclaw.
[77:19.63]I want to, but we gotta get to the actual game.
[77:31.04]In the meantime... Oh, shit.
[77:34.04]Whoops.
[77:36.30]Thanks to Zalavar Yolcarps.
[77:39.00]Moral fact...
[77:40.66]Nuclear 13 Banana.
[77:42.40]Nuclearly Banana.
[77:44.00]Thanks a lot, guys, for subbing.
[77:45.67]Also, thanks to Ubery Ratty.
[77:48.41]Lightning Bolt.
[77:49.35]Those two guys were two months and nine months, respectively.
[77:51.94]This is the one.
[77:55.84]Here.
[77:56.06]No, I remember this guy, yeah.
[78:09.62]Wait, what?
[78:10.66]You're telling me I can get rid of everybody right now?
[78:16.53]Play as a deathclaw?
[78:21.51]Kill all, kill all.
[78:22.96]Hey!
[78:45.55]She's alive.
[78:56.48]This just got really, really scary.
[79:10.21]Can I get out of here?
[79:10.91]I did it.
[79:18.14]She's holding a pretend baby in her hands.
[79:28.77]I can't get out of here.
[79:31.15]Collision's off.
[79:40.72]She doesn't want to die.
[79:41.94]She won't die.
[79:44.36]She's still alive.
[79:47.50]Stay down.
[79:52.16]I killed her.
[79:52.62]Back to life.
[80:03.51]She's unkillable.
[80:04.63]She comes back to life.
[80:08.17]Okay.
[80:08.41]Load.

[80:46.95]Now wait a minute!
[80:50.51]I'm okay.
[80:54.91]What the fuck?
[80:59.66]Put collision back on.
[81:02.62]And get us back here.
[81:06.24]Don't save it.
[81:07.28]Load.

[81:15.67]I'm done fucking around.

[81:22.75]Collision off.
[81:24.51]Collision on.
[81:30.67]What is going on right now?
[81:33.73]Something's not right.
[81:34.45]Something is not right.
[81:36.19]Alright, set.
[81:36.57]How do I make this going fast forward?
[81:48.07]Oh, it's my clock speed Something's not quite right.
[81:54.80]We did it.
[81:56.02]We made it
[82:17.61]What are you hiding?
[82:18.67]Dab?
[82:19.87]We're talking about dab.
[82:21.23]Alright, up the stairs.
[82:22.01]This is not something.
[82:23.07]It's not right.
[82:23.63]It's my speed, right, player?
[82:24.75]I don't even know what the goddamn command is.
[82:43.93]Player.setAV, speedmult, zero.
[82:50.02]Right?
[82:50.28]Got it.
[82:50.48]Female and infant.
[82:51.12]Alright, let's go.
[82:52.08]That suit?
[82:52.66]Uh, thanks.
[82:53.14]What now?
[82:53.48]Thank you, excuse me.
[82:54.14]Follow me.
[83:14.49]Small.
[83:14.89]No, no more small.
[83:17.01]This is our new home.
[83:19.14]Even hitting caps doesn't do anything.
[83:21.78]But I'm having fun.
[83:23.46]This is fun.
[83:23.88]It's fun to be a weirdo and fuck around the settings.
[83:25.90]Let's just let this happen.
[83:26.84]Let it play out.
[83:29.24]Do not kill all
[83:53.68]Hey there.
[83:53.98]Just step in here and put your vault suit on.
[83:56.47]Small or riot?
[83:57.53]No!
[83:58.07]I'm not gonna be small.
[84:00.99]It'll be okay.
[84:02.59]Who's my little guy?
[84:04.53]I'm not going far.
[84:05.51]Can you come here?
[84:07.83]Can I come here?
[84:13.99]The pod will decontaminate and depressurize you.
[84:17.32]I was just gonna kill alright there.
[84:19.12]Just relax.
[84:22.34]No, I'm not going small.
[84:23.82]I'm not going tiny.
[84:26.50]Tiny's a bad idea.
[84:27.70]I need to get out of the tutorial.
[84:31.40]Do you guys want to keep me in this tutorial the whole time we're here?
[84:41.03]I've been streaming for an hour and a half.
[84:42.21]I will not going to lie.
[84:45.80]It did go by pretty fast.
[84:46.82]We were having some fun.
[84:48.52]These games are fun.
[84:49.76]Fun games.
[84:52.02]How dare you say something like that about me.
[85:01.83]Tiny, tiny.
[85:04.47]It's time to riot.
[85:09.67]Easy Pete's not even in this game.
[85:15.83]I would laugh my ass off, though, if for some reason... I didn't get out of the... The entire stream was in the tutorial the whole time.
[85:27.34]Just let me get out of here so we can't... When I fuck around, I'll have to watch a dumb, like, three-minute cutscene again.
[85:36.25]But in the meantime... Let me scroll this down.
[85:43.68]I missed a bunch of subs.
[85:45.55]I missed a bunch of stuff.

[86:30.75]Little Chubba.
[86:32.34]They were bits, too.
[86:33.16]Never trust a purple who's dropping bits.
[86:35.14]So were a bunch of other people.
[86:36.38]100, 1,000, 1,000.
[86:37.48]You guys are fucking crazy.
[86:39.37]I love y'all.
[86:41.09]You guys all rock.
[86:44.17]Who else?

[86:47.03]Thank you, Todd.
[86:49.05]Baked Flakes gave 1,500. 1,500.
[86:51.72]Todd gave a thousand, actually.
[86:52.74]Thanks, Todd.
[86:53.24]And Linker, of course, with the 5,000.
[86:54.46]And then everybody in the beginning was also, you guys are fucking generous.
[86:57.92]Super generous people.
[86:59.89]Now let's watch my wife die.
[87:01.17]Let the boy go.
[87:03.91]I'm only going to tell you once.
[87:10.59]I'm not giving you, Sean.
[87:14.41]Get me out of here.
[87:18.49]I'm going to get out of here.
[87:19.96]I'm going to save my life.
[87:29.28]Did someone say Snaticats?
[87:40.10]I can't wait until we get the title screen to pop up after two hours.
[87:46.73]Why do I breathe so heavy?
[87:47.79]Why am I heavy breathed?
[87:58.33]Alright.
[88:00.01]Let's go.
[88:06.83]Predefined story.
[88:07.72]That's actually why I didn't like this game.
[88:11.40]I didn't like the fact that I was a guy that just talked.
[88:14.94]And I couldn't be like a total idiot.
[88:20.79]And the story kind of just was going to go its own way.
[88:22.61]But, alright, I need to...
[88:27.13]I'm gonna beat somebody's fucking head in.
[88:37.95]Never trust a purple again?
[88:39.39]There's a sex change command.
[88:41.49]You can just click on someone while in console and type sex change.
[88:46.33]What does that do?
[88:49.55]Why would Voltaire do this?
[88:55.19]Inaccessible.
[88:56.44]Inaccessible.
[88:59.72]Just get out of the tutorial for God's sakes.
[89:01.96]Oh shit, a cockroach!
[89:05.36]Wait, uh, did I do something in my video here?
[89:07.69]I don't remember.
[89:09.55]I might have.
[89:11.19]I probably went like this.
[89:14.37]Oh, whoa, cockroaches!
[89:15.73]Gross!
[89:16.29]Whoa!
[89:16.75]Disgusting!
[89:17.77]Fuck!
[89:19.98]Wow, dude.
[89:21.16]Did you see that, dude?
[89:22.00]I think I'm not useless.
[89:49.96]Power attack.
[89:52.01]I remember things now.
[89:53.25]A lot on my screen.
[89:55.99]Get it off.
[89:57.67]There's a gun.
[89:58.51]Oh, right.
[90:06.78]They have like a quick menu, right?
[90:08.02]I want to be pistol man.
[90:23.08]Lots of bullets.
[90:26.96]No Bobby pins?
[90:27.68]That's so stupid that I can't just break into this.
[90:32.94]I wish you could smash the glass.
[90:36.99]Alright.
[90:38.77]Let's go.
[90:39.13]First let's flush the toilet because it's funny.
[90:41.71]You have to flush the toilet in all these games.
[90:51.40]Just give myself the... Terminal only.
[90:54.80]Where's the terminal?
[90:59.54]Console command unlock.
[91:06.76]Oh, God.
[91:07.56]I would never live that down, though.
[91:10.14]If I do console command... Tell me... How do I do it again?
[91:13.22]It's console command unlock.
[91:16.48]That's like how you do it?
[91:18.67]That's like the command?
[91:20.45]Out of Bobby pins.
[91:24.91]Everyone will talk shit to me.
[91:25.97]Everyone will hate me.
[91:27.09]What happened here?
[91:29.23]Where is everyone?
[91:31.69]Do it, do it, do it.
[91:32.49]Oh my god.
[91:34.95]What is it?
[91:39.03]Click it.
[91:39.59]You don't have to use it.
[91:42.95]Click it.
[91:45.21]You have to click it first.
[91:47.77]Don't have any Bobby pins.
[91:53.46]Oh.
[91:58.30]No Bobby pins.
[91:59.75]No Bobby pins.
[92:01.47]No Bobby pins.
[92:02.17]No Bobby pins!
[92:06.93]Open it!
[92:09.79]Unlocked Andrew Jackerry Jacked?
[92:13.64]Oh, there we go.
[92:15.52]Nice.
[92:16.52]Okay, yeah.
[92:17.32]Thanks for the item.
[92:20.60]I unlocked myself.
[92:26.43]Where's the gun?
[92:30.16]What a fucking cheap piece of shit.
[92:32.34]Like, that's why people are gonna... Whatever, I've played this game before.
[92:37.74]Don't worry.
[92:38.48]It won't happen.
[92:39.12]Who cares?
[92:42.24]Where's that weapon?
[92:50.97]Where's my Pip-Boy?
[92:54.13]Just put it back.
[93:05.77]One, two, three.
[93:08.05]One, two, three.
[93:08.97]One, two, three.
[93:10.61]One, two, three.
[93:11.53]One, two, three.
[93:26.06]Is this all that's left?
[93:30.90]There it is.
[93:31.38]There's the little shit boy.
[93:44.44]Basically, it basically says the character NPC to the other sex, and it really fucks up their appearance.
[93:48.64]You can get some spectacular faces.
[93:56.30]There is Mr. Pip-Boy.
[93:57.50]Alright, inventory.
[94:03.14]There it is.
[94:03.80]Put it on.
[94:05.00]The cryo-jengulator.
[94:12.81]Free weapon.
[94:20.16]Time to leave the tutorial.
[94:26.02]Leave the tutorial with an extremely powerful, game-winning weapon.
[94:30.62]Let's see what it does.
[94:37.43]Oh, it shoots cryogenic liquid.
[94:40.52]I can nitrogen freeze people.
[94:41.88]That sounds like fun.
[94:48.18]Free weapon for cheaters.
[94:49.48]Yeah.
[94:51.96]And they said crime doesn't pay.
[94:54.20]It does.
[94:56.54]Because I have a free gun.
[94:59.68]See, crime pays in a single-player video game.
[95:04.01]Nowhere else.
[95:11.94]Open up.
[95:14.76]Here comes the very heavy music.
[95:17.02]Fallout 4.
[95:17.92]Welcome to the game.
[95:42.92]Get me in here, please.
[95:44.74]God.
[95:45.20]Alright, we're good.
[95:46.34]Do you want to change anything?
[95:47.16]Change name, special ed, change appearance, finished, exit the vault.
[95:49.78]Get me out of here.
[95:55.47]Can we get an uptime here?
[96:01.05]Because I just walked out of the tutorial door.
[96:09.72]You could have already been in there if you were tiny.
[96:20.15]One hour and 36 minutes.
[96:24.05]Oh, son.
[96:25.15]You finally see the light of day.
[96:27.75]How long were you down there?
[96:28.67]An hour and 36 minutes?
[96:31.03]That must be your new record, son.
[96:32.75]Oh, God.
[96:38.76]Go home.
[96:49.50]Just like Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.
[96:52.86]Jump around with you, have your ski boots.
[97:02.67]Yeah, it's gonna be... That guy's gonna be in here.
[97:08.05]He's gonna say, your whole family is gone, and everyone's gone, and it's 55 years in the future, and yadda yadda yadda.
[97:15.98]As I live and breathe,
[97:20.15]Save, save, save.
[97:22.90]What is quick save?
[97:23.52]F5?
[97:23.60]F5.
[97:23.70]This used to be a small stream.
[97:25.96]Gas him?
[97:26.24]He'll kill me.
[97:26.52]I will lose this fight.
[97:47.78]Funny joke.
[97:48.48]That's a funny joke, apparently?
[97:50.74]She can't be dead.
[97:51.46]She can't be.
[97:51.96]She can't be dead.
[97:52.82]They shot her in the face.
[97:54.70]I'm in a bad dream, dear.
[98:12.82]I've had a bad dream.
[98:13.96]I believe you need a distraction.
[98:16.40]Yes, a distraction.
[98:18.09]It's been ages.
[98:19.77]Sean's been kidnapped.
[98:25.45]It's worth.
[98:26.89]Doesn't matter how long it's been.
[98:28.33]A bit over 210, actually, sir.
[98:32.30]That mean?
[98:34.02]Codsworth.
[98:36.76]I... Oh, sir, it's been just horrible.
[98:44.01]Sure.
[98:47.27]What do you know, Codsworth?
[98:49.85]I'm afraid I don't know anything, sir.
[98:51.81]Sex change, Codsworth.
[98:52.97]Moms came and all of you left in such a... I did find this... Thank you, Codsworth.
[99:02.60]You're welcome.
[99:04.16]Now, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
[99:06.99]Shall we search the neighborhood?
[99:08.39]Mm-hmm.
[99:11.33]Alright.
[99:12.43]Okay, hold on.
[99:18.33]Let's sex change Codsworth.
[99:32.28]What?
[99:32.54]It didn't... He just like... It didn't do anything.
[99:44.51]He just, he like, his body changed a tiny bit.
[99:49.59]He doesn't do anything.
[99:53.69]Kill the insects.
[99:56.09]He no longer has a robo-dick.
[100:02.37]Yeah, that's true.
[100:07.83]Dude, I'm so like obsessed with the casino.
[100:10.21]And like I think the casino is so much fun.
[100:12.20]I thought these were casino chips.
[100:14.95]I was about to be like, oh, nice, casino chips.
[100:17.21]Cool.
[100:18.67]Maybe I can play with those.
[100:19.65]No, it's candles.
[100:20.89]Just candles.
[100:21.41]Calm down.
[100:24.73]Anything else in here I can take?
[100:28.79]Yes, I can.
[100:29.45]There's a stim pack.
[100:31.31]And Bobby pin.
[100:35.40]Let's get this over with, God's worth.
[100:36.66]I got places to be.
[100:48.91]Gambling addicts?
[100:49.83]No.
[100:51.22]I just like the casino.
[100:53.04]And I like going like this.
[100:56.80]I don't have anything to make that point.
[100:57.86]Never mind.
[100:58.98]Codsworth.
[101:00.22]Is there a casino in this game?
[101:03.29]I don't think so.
[101:11.15]Thanks for trying, Codsworth.
[101:12.59]Spawned my wife.
[101:13.65]Jeremy, what's your first name?
[101:16.43]Greg.
[101:16.67]Craig.
[101:17.05]Thanks for your help, Codsworth.
[101:18.21]I just like the casino.
[101:19.85]It sounds like an addict to me.
[101:21.17]No?
[101:21.29]No?
[101:40.07]No, you are not going the right way, dude.
[101:46.11]Some radical X. A pumpkin.
[101:50.65]Don't ask me why I'm taking the pumpkin.
[101:53.93]Wait, what was that?
[101:54.45]Take the baby rattle?
[102:01.32]Anything else in here that I need?
[102:12.27]Take American flag.
[102:15.49]Any old rotten food I can stuff in my pants?
[102:18.95]I don't think so.
[102:25.14]So, let's go this way.
[102:28.74]There's another thing with, like, settlements in this game.
[102:30.52]Don't you rebuild the whole community?
[102:36.76]Uh, rogue.
[102:38.08]I don't know what that is.
[102:41.22]My first name is Craig.
[102:45.48]Craig Gregg.
[102:52.19]That's it.
[102:53.41]I don't have a last name.
[102:55.87]I'm just leaving Farnsworth behind.
[102:58.39]Enable radio music?
[103:07.00]No.
[103:08.12]For one reason, because I don't want to get copyright claimed if this eventually makes its way to YouTube.
[103:15.47]Yeah, you can adjust shit.
[103:16.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:17.41]I don't have any money for this.
[103:18.57]Where's my dog?
[103:19.29]My dog friend.
[103:22.34]Dog friend?
[103:25.58]Dog friend?
[103:27.04]Where are you?
[103:27.50]Dog friend?
[103:31.95]Dog friend?
[103:36.19]Where's my dog friend?
[103:51.05]Isn't he just in here?
[103:51.75]I thought he was just inside this house.
[104:08.93]Give me that subway token.
[104:11.09]Clipboard.
[104:14.92]He's already gone.
[104:15.60]He doesn't want to be part of this shit show.
[104:19.32]I don't know.
[104:19.74]I'll just spawn my own dog.
[104:28.47]Why did I take the telephone?
[104:30.61]I do this every time I play these games.
[104:32.77]I take everything.
[104:34.81]I'm a psycho.
[104:39.77]Hide and seek.
[104:40.33]Where the fuck is he?
[104:44.87]There he is.
[104:45.27]Hey, you.
[104:46.77]Hey, boy.
[104:49.65]What are you doing here all by yourself?
[104:53.82]You're a mutt.
[104:55.86]You lose your owner, buddy.
[104:59.76]Okay, then.
[105:00.42]I'm going to sex change the dog.
[105:05.10]Wait, what?
[105:06.20]How are you doing, buddy?
[105:16.87]I keep turning my back.
[105:28.36]Oh, shit!
[105:29.06]That was me!
[105:35.55]Oh, no!
[105:36.37]Hold on.
[105:45.90]Hey, boy.
[105:48.14]Good thing I saved it.
[106:00.98]No, that doesn't do anything.
[106:02.30]They just kind of look... He got a little bigger.
[106:06.38]Wait, can I make the dog bigger?
[106:07.38]I can do set scale on him, right?
[106:11.40]Can I make him a huge Dark Souls boss?
[106:18.46]Now, how do I make my dog a Dark Souls boss?
[106:27.73]Okay, set scale.
[106:43.45]Like, what?
[106:44.00]Ten?
[106:44.46]No, like three.
[106:46.44]As long as I'm pointing at him, right?
[106:49.88]There we go.
[106:50.42]Now I have my... I got Sif with me.
[106:52.38]Come on, Sif.
[106:56.78]Over here.
[106:59.70]He wants to fuck with my Dark Souls companion.
[107:06.02]Ten?
[107:06.64]Actually, yeah, Sif is a little bigger, isn't he?
[107:08.30]Let's go with, like, four.
[107:21.61]No, set skill.
[107:25.26]Five.
[107:27.90]There we go.
[107:29.08]That's my fucking buddy.
[107:34.02]Go there.
[107:37.04]Oh, no.
[107:40.39]I think he might be too big.
[107:42.67]Make him do more damage?
[107:43.95]I just increased his hitbox?
[107:48.63]Alright, here we go.
[107:50.77]He's taking a shit.
[107:53.69]I thought he really was.
[107:54.57]Oh, he's so fast.
[108:01.38]He can move so quickly.
[108:02.48]He's like, I don't know what to call him.
[108:04.58]Too big.
[108:04.96]Moving out.
[108:19.49]Come on, keep going.
[108:20.69]Don't get stuck in a building.
[108:25.97]Look at him being so sneaky.
[108:29.72]He's doing it too.
[108:30.60]Alright, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[108:34.76]Hey, come here, come on.
[108:36.56]You gotta be very quiet.
[108:41.05]Creep over here, creep over, creep over, come on.
[108:50.89]Come on, you can make it down the street.
[108:52.31]Alright, command.
[109:02.61]On him.
[109:06.93]Get him.
[109:08.27]Rip him apart.
[109:10.55]I'll help you.
[109:10.95]I'll freeze him.
[109:20.27]This is such a broken weapon.
[109:23.87]Honest to god.
[109:25.67]I'm gonna beat this whole game with this weapon.
[109:29.37]This is so cheap.
[109:33.61]Okay, I gotta bring him down again.
[109:35.03]This is fucking too much.
[109:39.39]Dog.
[109:42.29]You sex-changing the dog, no joke, crashed my browser.
[109:50.86]It sucks late game.
[109:55.64]No, this is not going to work.
[109:58.12]I don't want to do this anymore.
[109:59.20]The music too is fucking me up.
[110:00.70]Let's get him back to normal.
[110:06.95]There.
[110:07.43]Alright, let's go.
[110:17.39]Dammit, advanced lock.
[110:20.27]Get out of the way.
[110:21.49]Hold position.
[110:24.19]Go!
[110:26.79]Okay, I think I fucked up something in my game.
[110:30.03]Because walking forward is actually a lot harder.
[110:35.28]This is so easy.
[110:40.84]This is too easy.
[110:42.38]I gotta get rid of this weapon.
[110:44.36]It's too much.
[110:46.68]The joke is over.
[110:53.53]The music is just so much louder too.
[111:03.20]The music is seriously freaking me out.
[111:13.89]Fuck.
[111:14.49]It's a novice lock and I just failed it on camera.
[111:26.05]Fusion core.
[111:30.41]Small dog?
[111:31.37]No, he's a regular sized dog.
[111:33.89]Hey.
[111:37.92]I crashed my game.
[111:39.28]I think.
[111:44.68]Nope.
[111:44.92]Something's not right.
[111:46.00]Something is definitely not right here.
[111:48.92]Things don't feel like they're actually being played.
[111:51.93]Nothing feels right.
[111:56.04]You know what I'm talking about?
[111:57.10]Things just don't feel like they're going correct.
[112:06.02]I feel like I'm watching somebody else play this game.
[112:12.38]Am I having an existential crisis right now?
[112:16.07]Oh, what?
[112:17.79]There's something going on here.
[112:23.60]Yeah, the game's, like, hanging, like, I'm already, I'm, like, crashing.
[112:29.76]Oh, God.
[112:32.68]Something's not right.
[112:38.57]Increase my FOV, how do I do it? 90.
[112:52.59]Bad PC.
[112:53.49]I don't know what it is, man.
[112:54.52]I'll tell you, something's odd.
[112:55.82]Do I have to go all the way up?
[113:01.82]I think I do.
[113:07.36]How do I put my gun away?
[113:13.20]I'm telling you, man.
[113:14.16]Let's just get the hell out of here.
[113:15.58]We got no reason to hang around and get shot.
[113:17.52]Stop being such a fucking pansy.
[113:27.86]Come on.
[113:28.44]Alright, I'm gonna go bats this guy.
[113:32.55]That's not bats.
[113:42.03]There's like three different songs playing.
[113:46.49]This is like fucking causing so many problems for me.
[114:01.20]Alright, let me put on my apparel.
[114:12.38]Put on the raider gear.
[114:15.62]This is what happens when you play God.
[114:24.53]You know it's true.
[114:25.61]What are they hearing?
[114:26.49]Is the dog just wicked fucked up making a ton of noise?
[114:29.87]I feel like his dog thinks it's like 500 feet tall still.
[114:57.17]I think I broke the dog.
[114:58.23]I can't even fucking tell.
[115:13.86]I gotta do a cool melee kill to this guy.
[115:17.90]I don't even know that these guys are good guys.
[115:19.00]I don't remember.
[115:19.44]Should I just dismiss the dog?
[115:27.11]He's having trouble.
[115:30.57]You owe me.
[115:31.99]Yeah, sure thing.
[115:33.73]I'll give you my chest full of emeralds.
[115:35.87]Sex change these guys.
[115:36.71]Just as soon as we're out of this mess.
[115:42.00]I have my own problems, Garvey.
[115:43.72]Yeah?
[115:44.84]Like what?
[115:45.38]How would I know this guy's name?
[115:46.46]You help us, maybe we can help you.
[115:50.23]Looking for an infant boy.
[115:52.45]He's been kidnapped.
[115:53.29]Yours or tracking for someone else?
[115:55.76]Used to be a lot of families in this group.
[115:58.44]More than a few missing relatives.
[116:01.10]A month ago, there were 20 of us.
[116:03.50]Yesterday, there were eight.
[116:06.41]Now we're five.
[116:09.77]It's a cruel world.
[116:10.71]You think I don't know that?
[116:13.33]The things I've seen.
[116:15.79]The things I've done.
[116:18.90]Uh-huh.
[116:20.32]One good idea can make all the difference.
[116:22.60]Sturgis.
[116:23.36]I love skipping.
[116:25.28]There's a crashed vertibird up on the roof.
[116:28.12]Old school.
[116:29.00]Pre-war.
[116:30.14]You might have seen it.
[116:31.61]Jay Leno.
[116:33.55]What's his name?
[116:36.17]Jack?
[116:36.55]John Kerry?
[116:37.11]We're talking a full suit of cherry T-45 power armor.
[116:41.21]John Kerry Jacked?
[116:42.39]I don't even know what his name is.
[116:43.73]I forgot it.
[116:46.09]What makes that power armor so special?
[116:48.72]Westech internalized servo system.
[116:51.04]That's what.
[116:51.48]That affable, uh-huh.
[116:52.46]Inside that baby, super is the new normal.
[116:55.86]You'll be stronger, tougher, resistant to rats.
[117:00.42]Get the suit.
[117:01.62]You can rip the minigun right off the vertebra.
[117:06.95]Minigun?
[117:08.33]Now we're talking.
[117:09.51]I know, right?
[117:11.47]It can be powered up again.
[117:12.97]Wait, what?
[117:14.03]But we're a bit stuck.
[117:15.37]Please put me on camera.
[117:18.79]I'll help if I can.
[117:20.01]Give me that power on.
[117:20.69]But we can't get to the damn thing.
[117:23.41]Andrew Jack Kerry Jack.
[117:25.13]Locked behind a security gate.
[117:26.81]What is his name?
[117:27.39]Look, I fix stuff.
[117:29.83]I tinker.
[117:30.97]Why is there a guy with a vague southern accent here?
[117:34.59]What are you looking for again?
[117:35.69]Fuck, I just told him to recap the story.
[117:40.73]I don't know.
[117:41.61]We'll see.
[117:42.61]Well, it's not a no.
[117:44.88]Look.
[117:45.82]If you can get to the fusion core, Jack it into that power armor, and grab the minigun, then those raiders will know they picked the wrong fight.
[117:53.58]Good luck.
[117:56.92]Sure.
[117:58.26]Alright, let's go get a fusion core.
[118:02.74]Careful, kid.
[118:04.58]There's something coming.
[118:06.88]Alright, for real, though.
[118:10.68]He's angry.
[118:14.63]Fusion core.
[118:17.69]Let's go get it.
[118:24.01]Sex change.
[118:24.49]Sex change.
[118:25.15]You guys are all about the sex change.
[118:31.75]We're moving on from that joke.
[118:33.17]We're going to move on to an even better one.
[118:36.83]Called LOL.
[118:37.70]Look at how many deathclaws I just spawned.
[118:40.74]We're gonna move on from that joke to LOL.
[118:42.82]Look at how many deathclaws I just spawned.
[118:44.18]Haha.
[118:59.61]No, don't take it out.
[119:01.59]Get in.
[119:06.52]Sick.
[119:14.69]Take it all.
[119:16.31]Get on the minigun.
[119:18.33]Finish the tutorial.
[119:19.27]Save game.
[119:19.49]I haven't done that in a long time.
[119:47.40]Who's next?
[119:49.96]Can I kill this guy?
[120:00.39]I wonder, can I jump down?
[120:03.25]The dogs are still up here.
[120:15.12]I feel bad for the dog now.
[120:16.10]This is probably really loud.
[120:17.12]I forgot how boring this was.
[120:33.47]Be careful, dog.
[120:35.39]Dog, be careful, please.
[120:37.15]Don't get that close to the edge.
[120:40.42]Are we done?
[120:41.84]Did I do it?
[120:42.30]No.
[120:42.86]There's three more random guys that are going to run over here.
[120:48.50]Dog, get out of the fucking way, please.
[120:50.32]I'm gonna trade with the dog.
[120:54.52]Go over there!
[121:14.81]Everybody thought I was gonna die!
[121:15.99]This is a deathclaw.
[121:17.07]I forgot about the deathclaw.
[121:18.03]Go back in the building.
[121:18.69]I shouldn't have gone in the building.
[121:31.39]Go back out, you'll be fine.
[121:45.21]Nobody thought you were gonna die.
[121:46.48]I know.
[121:46.92]I've played this part of the tutorial.
[121:57.02]I know this whole game by heart.
[121:58.75]At least the first seven hours of it.
[122:00.17]First is the deathclaw.
[122:04.55]And there's a couple of raiders.
[122:05.51]Eat lead!
[122:16.70]Oh shit!

[123:04.26]Where is the deathclaw?
[123:06.36]Oh, he's right there.
[123:06.92]He's just standing there, hanging out.
[123:17.89]No, I'm gonna fucking go back inside.
[123:26.04]Open the door.
[123:30.14]It's going up and I'm gonna shoot down at him.
[123:33.20]Set scale 10 on deathclaw.
[123:42.33]Wait, what?
[123:46.30]Can I not even go this way?
[123:47.66]Oh, fuck me.
[123:49.80]Coward.
[123:50.38]No, I just don't want to die there again.
[123:51.98]I want to move on.
[123:53.54]Let me heal my shit.
[123:54.80]How do I get to my body here?
[124:17.64]Did I not, like, heal this shit?
[124:23.52]No, I got something for you.

[125:27.56]Why can I not freeze them?
[125:29.36]That would have been so cool.

[133:19.52]What's with these fucking loading screens?
[133:21.00]Why is my game so fucked up?
[133:22.94]I fucked it up in the beginning and I fucked up everything.
[133:28.97]Fucking around in the beginning like that screwed up the entire game.
[133:34.45]This is not supposed to be happening.
[133:45.95]This shit's not supposed to fucking happen.
[133:54.16]We have to go back to the beginning of the game so I can not fuck with it so it doesn't break.
[134:02.50]Holy shit.
[134:08.61]That was a pretty amazing display.
[134:11.73]I'm just glad you weren't on our side.
[134:13.01]This is the Deathclaw bullshit.
[134:18.08]Stop kidding yourself.
[134:20.36]You're nothing to me.
[134:22.38]You know, you talk like a jerk, but you still helped us out, whether you wanted to or not.
[134:27.30]Listen, when we first met, I didn't even skip that.
[134:30.10]I thought this was going to go well.
[134:34.71]It will from here on out, because now I'm going to pay attention.
[134:36.63]You're welcome.
[134:45.65]Well, since you say that, maybe you'll come to Sanctuary with us.
[134:49.65]We could use your help getting settled there.
[134:55.55]Uh, should I go with him?
[135:02.09]I got my own problem.
[135:03.05]Oh, go fuck yourself.
[135:03.65]Well, that much is true.
[135:06.46]Cause I seen your destiny.
[135:10.46]And I know your pain.
[135:15.71]Please tell me.
[135:16.63]I need to know.
[135:18.21]You're a man out of time, out of hope, but all's not lost.
[135:23.72]There's no way you're going to pay attention.
[135:24.86]I can feel your son's energy.
[135:28.24]He's alive.
[135:29.30]I knew it.
[135:34.00]Please tell me where he is.

[140:41.97]I need to go this way.
[140:47.46]Diamond City.
[140:48.60]I thought that was a super mutant for a second.
[141:04.08]Nope.
[141:05.80]That's just my discarded body.
[141:16.47]No, I don't care about those guys.
[141:17.53]I'm going to Diamond City.
[141:20.25]I'm not joining him anywhere.
[141:21.83]Going straight here.
[141:22.53]We're going straight in.
[141:31.91]I already sex-changed the dog like an hour ago.
[141:34.43]He just stood up and did a trick.
[141:40.36]Zed count.
[141:46.77]I'm gonna run into something I know I am.
[141:51.47]We had a deal, Trudy.
[141:53.61]Hand over the goods.
[141:54.99]You owe us.
[141:56.16]I ain't giving you poison-chilling chem-pushers anything.
[141:59.14]Do you know what that junk has done to my boy?
[142:01.42]He bought them fair and square, Trudy.
[142:04.24]Ain't our fault if he's strung out.
[142:06.06]Now don't make me come in there and shoot up that little trading post of yours.
[142:09.90]Whoa, whoa.
[142:10.90]Easy there, scaver.
[142:12.90]This doesn't involve you.
[142:16.98]You stop waving that gun in my face, or it's gonna involve me.
[142:20.26]Okay, okay, just take it easy.
[142:21.56]Okay, alright, sure, okay.
[142:22.96]We'll lower our weapons, alright?
[142:25.66]Just don't do anything crazy.
[142:28.55]Now hand over your money.
[142:29.97]All of it.
[142:30.39]Just keep calm, alright?
[142:32.27]Here.
[142:33.57]That's everything I have.
[142:37.37]Now get the hell out of here, both of you.
[142:38.93]That's it.
[142:39.91]You're dead.
[142:40.73]You crossed the line.
[142:48.03]Yeah, persuasion failed, don't matter.
[142:54.34]My head has been crippled.
[142:56.54]Has it now?
[143:05.48]I can't see!
[143:10.93]Where you going, dog?
[143:13.85]I saved these guys.
[143:16.55]They owe me lots of money now.
[143:18.51]Alright, honestly, this fucking music needs to shut up.
[143:23.38]Holy God.
[143:26.04]I'm getting a Jerry Brockheimer movie in my head every fucking five minutes.
[143:31.86]Never take a hit of Jad again, I swear.
[143:34.72]So do I get anything but windy money?
[143:37.20]I can't wait to see the crows feeding on that scumbag.
[143:40.68]Here, this is for you.
[143:42.82]Now, if you ever need to trade, my shop's open.
[143:46.61]Oh, okay.
[143:47.31]Let's trade.
[143:49.79]I've got a few minutes to browse.
[143:51.07]I need... What do I need?
[143:58.93]Let's go to the bottom here.
[143:59.91]I'm going to sell the minigun.
[144:01.78]How much does she have?
[144:03.32]300?
[144:03.34]What's it worth?
[144:05.14]Yeah.
[144:05.54]I don't want it.
[144:06.02]Get rid of it.
[144:07.70]I got some teeth for you.
[144:21.59]I don't want any power armor.
[144:26.31]Just get rid of all of it.
[144:27.27]Don't want it.
[144:32.51]You can have a telephone too.
[144:33.73]And a toaster.
[144:34.95]And a car.
[144:42.77]And I want from you... I'll do that first.
[144:49.65]Let me check on this.
[144:58.93]I want to shoot pistols, so... Are these all 10mm?
[145:02.83]1.38?
[145:03.35]1.38.
[145:06.11]Pipe pistol.
[145:06.91]Pipe auto pistol.
[145:13.08]I'll get some .38s.
[145:13.46]Hi.
[145:13.74]I can rest easy knowing that Wolfgang is rotten to hell.
[145:22.18]You guys want me to sex change every single person.
[145:24.92]Do you need anything?
[145:27.69]Sure.
[145:28.25]Let's take a look.
[145:28.99]It's all worth every cap I'm charging.
[145:37.47]Give me a million rounds.
[145:39.74]I have 38.
[145:40.10]Yeah, I don't want to do power armor.
[145:44.26]I don't want it.
[145:45.16]Now you have a nice day.
[145:50.28]Actually, you have Stimpaks?
[145:51.83]Hey there.
[145:52.61]Shop's open.
[145:53.85]What do you want?
[145:56.55]Let's see what you have.
[145:57.11]A little bit of everything.
[145:57.97]Right.
[146:02.27]She has a lot of shit.
[146:11.94]Alright, let's go.
[146:14.70]On to Diamond City.
[146:30.41]I'm going to stick with the pipe pistol for now.
[146:33.37]I want a heavy hitting 1D.
[146:34.30]You know what I mean?
[146:43.26]Put on subtitles?
[146:45.60]Sure.
[146:50.66]Where even is that?
[146:52.38]I don't know.
[147:04.49]There.
[147:05.01]Subtitles on.
[147:07.79]Do speed multiplier.
[147:08.95]Alright, we'll fuck around once I do the first thing in Diamond City.
[147:16.73]I believe I leveled up too.
[147:17.61]Alright, what do I need?
[147:24.40]Gunslinger.
[147:26.66]Non-automatic pistols do 20% more damage.
[147:29.70]Isn't that kind of what I want?
[147:46.84]Fortune teller.
[147:47.58]What else is there?
[147:48.26]I don't think I've ever looked at these in any detail.
[147:50.50]Let's exchange the menu.
[148:04.72]Do I have any more points?
[148:12.12]No.
[148:17.89]Is it agility that does one-handers?
[148:25.89]Or does it not even matter in this game?
[148:39.78]I think it's agility, isn't it?
[148:46.93]Yeah, one handers.
[148:51.57]Still have another time.
[148:52.21]I have two points to put in, I think.
[148:55.47]Put one in agility and one in two.
[148:57.61]No, I definitely want more agility because I want more VAT system.
[149:06.30]No, I don't care about that right now.
[149:10.08]Perception.
[149:10.74]Oh.
[149:20.37]More luck, maybe.
[149:21.14]I could do another point of agility.
[149:31.01]I'll do perception.
[149:31.69]Alright, let's go.
[149:35.19]Shit, it's getting darker.
[149:40.16]That's when the creepers are going to come.
[149:41.18]I have to build my Minecraft house.
[149:58.88]Sex change the throat indoors.
[150:02.90]Alright, there's Las Vegas.
[150:07.24]How close am I?
[150:07.88]Am I even close at all?
[150:10.93]No, not even close.
[150:12.81]We'll get there eventually, don't worry.
[150:15.19]I promise.
[150:15.63]Alright, fire with this fire of these people.
[150:25.73]See if we can rob some fucking idiots blind.
[150:31.22]Well, okay.
[150:41.49]Do you have cola?
[150:42.55]Anything in there?
[150:44.27]Yes.
[150:44.45]I don't need to craft anything right now.
[150:48.19]Who cares?
[150:53.14]Whoa!
[151:11.53]Fucking rats.
[151:18.27]This place is like just flooding with radiation.
[151:20.21]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[151:24.25]They coming from the ground?
[151:27.43]Right in the gut.
[151:32.58]Yeah, I gotta get the hell away from this.
[151:40.07]Regardless of what's here, I gotta take my rads.
[151:44.45]Anything, anything, anything?
[151:51.98]F of E, 100?
[151:52.30]Yeah, that's probably better.
[151:55.36]Thanks for that.
[152:03.17]Although this is kind of far away now.
[152:10.56]Now, if I remember, Rad-X, Rad-Away.
[152:12.94]Which one is the one that's temporary?
[152:15.98]This is the one that makes it go away, right?
[152:19.34]Yep.
[152:24.93]F-O-V-3-H-U-N-D-R-I-D.
[152:29.85]Hey, but in my video, right?
[152:31.81]Let it tie 95, that's a fucking highway.
[152:39.14]That thing hostile?
[152:44.62]Are these things hostile?
[152:45.36]If I take any of these plants, I'm gonna get attacked.
[152:48.38]I know it.
[152:49.00]Save this shit.
[152:50.40]In case I get attacked.
[152:52.42]I'm gonna just take this corn.
[152:55.08]I guess they don't care.
[153:16.35]take as much as I possibly can take.
[153:18.02]This is kind of insane.
[153:18.66]Just give me everything you have.
[153:20.16]I'm just taking all that, like, planter shit.
[153:22.20]Alright, that was fun.
[153:46.21]You want to trade?
[153:48.25]What do you want to trade?
[153:51.91]Green.
[153:54.07]Sounds good.
[153:55.25]Now, what do you got for me?
[154:02.91]Uh, this is probably for the settlement shit, right?
[154:08.16]Take all this.
[154:08.82]I have, like, so much dumb stuff.
[154:15.00]Actually, wait a minute.
[154:15.50]Do I need that?
[154:16.04]I don't know.
[154:18.82]Sell him back the coin that I just took.
[154:20.58]Yeah, you can have, like, pajamas, too.
[154:42.11]Take them.
[154:59.69]Alright, let's go.
[155:05.39]Sell everything.
[155:06.73]No, I need to keep some stuff.
[155:08.86]He doesn't have any money.
[155:12.20]At some point, you sell them too many things and you're losing money because they don't have any caps to give you.
[155:22.94]Oh, shit.
[155:23.38]Take it all.
[155:28.84]Go check that out.
[155:31.03]Check out what I'm doing.
[155:31.82]Stealing.
[155:32.22]Alright, let's move on.
[155:38.84]Where was I going?
[155:39.68]Here.
[155:43.44]That way.
[155:43.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:44.66]I gotta turn around.
[155:48.23]Onto the bridge.
[155:52.17]Full Jupiter.
[155:58.67]Just wait till we get to Diamond City.
[155:59.75]We're gonna have a lot of fun.
[156:02.70]Nice dog name?
[156:03.54]What's his dog's name?
[156:04.98]Dog?
[156:07.26]It's his dog.
[156:13.86]Something's gonna come in the water.
[156:15.51]It'll attack me.
[156:21.51]Go quick!
[156:23.57]Go!
[156:24.35]Is my dog affected by radiation too?
[156:28.27]Probably.
[156:35.42]Let me take a sip.
[156:35.96]Thought that was my dog.
[156:41.71]That's not the dog.
[156:44.25]Okay, you have a fucking billion health.
[156:50.35]Are you shitting me right now?
[157:22.30]Okay.
[157:24.48]That was a different dog.
[157:25.26]That was a better dog.
[157:28.76]Let me get these fruits again.
[157:29.80]Alright, note to self.
[157:37.99]Watch out for the bigger dog that's going to kill you in one second.
[157:42.77]Not even killed for food, but killed for sport.
[157:44.65]Alright, I'm going to go around this time.
[157:50.30]Because I don't want to get killed by the alpha dog.
[157:55.44]This is what you get for stealing.
[157:56.44]Well, I'm not technically stealing.
[157:58.79]They don't need to eat it.
[158:02.65]Maybe somebody else does, but... It's mine now.
[158:12.08]Damn it, dog.
[158:12.64]Stop freaking me out like that.
[158:13.64]I keep thinking you're a bad guy.
[158:24.31]God damn it!
[158:27.49]Oh, it's okay.
[158:28.29]It's just a rad stack.
[158:32.36]Let's go back to FPS mode.
[158:41.16]First person.
[158:44.58]This is like a whole town.
[158:45.74]There's like raiders up here.
[158:49.44]What is that?
[158:50.31]What are these people?
[158:51.03]These are like super mutants.
[158:52.33]Not a good idea.
[159:08.10]Super mutant suicider.
[159:15.53]Somebody threw a bomb at me.
[159:18.39]Somebody just dropped a grenade over here.
[159:26.11]Dog, get away from him!
[159:28.61]Oh boy.
[159:29.37]I don't think I'm supposed to be over here yet.
[159:38.02]Okay.
[159:38.38]Right in the head.
[159:45.20]Come on.
[159:46.32]Come on.
[159:47.04]Cripple him.
[159:48.04]Jesus.
[159:53.12]I'm dead.
[159:53.54]Alright, we're not going that way.
[160:03.11]Spawn a Deathclaw.
[160:04.33]And then sex change it.
[160:07.56]Alright, we have to go across the water again.
[160:09.07]Because that way he's just dead.
[160:12.27]And die.
[160:13.29]Angry bark.
[160:15.97]Angry bark at what?
[160:18.19]I don't know.
[160:20.81]Maybe some walking on water here.
[160:22.09]Okay, how far away are we?
[160:36.44]Right there.
[160:37.78]Dog?
[160:38.08]I don't think the dog is still with me.
[160:42.74]He might be.
[160:43.12]He's probably just going to appear in front of me somewhere.
[160:49.01]Use TGM.
[160:51.59]It's going to get to Diamond City.
[160:53.61]Once I get to Diamond City, we can do whatever the hell we want.
[160:59.25]Although... This is the water pump, people.
[161:04.28]Maybe.
[161:05.51]What's the problem?
[161:06.27]We're having a lot of trouble with a group of raiders.
[161:08.91]Stealing our food and supplies.
[161:11.09]Do you think you can persuade them to leave us alone?
[161:15.09]Yeah.
[161:17.11]Any idea how many raiders we're talking about?
[161:19.33]No.
[161:22.57]Don't worry.
[161:23.51]I'll take care of those raiders for you.
[161:25.48]Good.
[161:26.34]It'll be a relief not to have to worry about them.
[161:33.51]They were just complaining about raiders taking all their provisions and I'm taking all of them.
[161:42.70]Like the raiders were probably nicer than I am being right now.
[161:45.48]They probably took like a handful.
[161:46.94]I took them all.
[161:47.36]Where are we going?
[161:50.46]Raiders.
[161:50.84]Raiders.
[162:05.20]What is this?
[162:09.14]Fuck if it's not on my map.
[162:11.42]Wouldn't it be like a little thing on the map?
[162:15.31]Is there anything else here?
[162:24.33]Cooking.
[162:27.32]Crafting.
[162:47.78]There we go.
[162:48.34]Okay.
[162:49.48]Going that way.
[162:50.06]Raider trouble.
[162:50.88]We'll just do that.
[162:51.50]Just get some money.
[162:53.44]Give me some money.
[163:00.65]Come on, dog.
[163:11.61]Fix the speed?
[163:16.00]Did I not change it back?
[163:16.94]I thought I came back from a save.
[163:25.14]What is it?
[163:25.44]Should it be 100?
[163:39.44]Player.setAVSpeedMult 100.
[163:40.79]I thought it was already there.
[163:55.25]Did that do anything?
[163:56.15]Am I going faster now?
[163:57.11]Should I be going this fast?
[164:04.24]Alright, dog baits are on our way.
[164:20.27]Almost there!
[164:27.13]Use COC smoke, QA smoke to make everyone switch?
[164:31.76]Look, I'm already having trouble with my game being like all fucking wickedy wackedy.
[164:37.95]I have like two... I say that as I freeze.
[164:41.61]My character just froze and I couldn't move.
[164:42.97]Let's save it here.
[164:55.10]Straight ahead.
[164:56.16]Kill all the bandits.
[164:56.88]Wish it wasn't so dark out.
[165:14.65]It's pretty nice popcorn you're popping there.
[165:17.55]Gonna put some cheese on it.
[165:19.69]Gonna put some butter on it.
[165:30.14]Alright.
[165:32.36]Where are the bandits?
[165:39.10]Hey.
[165:39.30]Oh fuck, he's up top.
[165:40.54]Yikes!
[165:41.24]Yikes!
[165:59.99]Like I wasn't even looking over here, he just like lobbed it over.
[166:03.20]He accidentally just threw that at me.
[166:05.12]I don't have any stimpaks either.
[166:06.68]Do I?
[166:06.94]I think I have one.
[166:07.58]I have two.
[166:18.95]Jesus!
[166:28.55]Stop throwing that shit.
[166:30.49]It's not fair.
[166:37.60]Did I really walk through the fucking fire?
[166:43.32]I thought I very, very, very abruptly missed it.
[166:48.99]Dude, I walked through the fucking... I didn't touch the fire.
[166:54.09]At all.
[166:54.57]That was such dog shit.
[167:06.38]Just like walked through the fire.
[167:07.92]There was a space where there was absolutely no fire.
[167:14.09]He's doing one shot kills.
[167:15.61]Dog, get the fuck out of my way.
[167:23.11]Whoa, whoa, shut the fuck up a second.
[167:24.24]Whoa, whoa, shut the fuck up.
[167:39.40]I just took a shopping basket.
[167:40.48]50-50.
[167:40.52]50-50 chance and I hit him once.
[168:09.18]Got him.
[168:15.66]Stupid fucking thing.
[168:19.26]Dog, you shouldn't run at it like that.
[168:22.68]Can I disable the turrets?
[168:31.87]Dog, get out of the way.
[168:36.78]It's like a computer.
[168:37.52]I can turn it off.
[168:38.20]I'm sure.
[168:39.48]It exists.
[168:54.91]That's not that computer.
[169:01.60]Make sure to take the clothes hanger.
[169:04.24]Let me see here for a second.
[169:07.13]I'm gonna whip a grenade over there.
[169:20.36]How do I equip it?
[169:23.54]Okay, that was a punch.
[169:36.77]I just, I thought I was like throwing a grenade.
[169:48.09]Gee, that's not doing it.
[169:55.68]Nuke a grenade.
[169:58.96]Okay.
[170:01.26]Hold bash, hold alt.
[170:05.59]Alright, let me put my pipe tester back on.
[170:07.80]Alright, hold it, Galt.
[170:16.97]Okay, I'm... That was a grenade.
[170:19.13]You fucking stupid game.
[170:30.74]Hold it.
[170:31.26]Hold the button down.
[170:33.34]Remember, make sure you hold the button down.
[170:49.51]I didn't even mean to do that.
[171:00.70]Are they dead?
[171:01.16]Why do I have zero?
[171:02.62]She's just burning.
[171:03.48]Look at Abby.
[171:03.98]Okay.
[171:04.24]Well, that was swell.
[171:05.90]That was swell.
[171:40.01]Can I cheese this?
[171:45.11]Cheesed it.
[171:46.53]My dog's doing a dance in front of it, but he can't attack me.
[171:50.35]Alright, save it.
[171:55.47]Give my dog a stim pack.
[171:57.71]Watch out for the fire.
[172:15.07]Take the bones.
[172:16.75]And he does something like a weird ritual.
[172:26.89]Jesus Christ.
[172:28.59]A lot of bones in here.
[172:31.17]Again.
[172:40.42]Again.
[172:40.62]Again.
[172:41.96]Again.
[172:56.89]Right in the face.
[172:57.63]One more time.
[172:58.41]Explode it.
[172:58.81]Explode!
[172:59.97]Fucking 95%.
[173:02.78]Kid didn't even hit him in the head.
[173:12.04]Anyone naked, people?
[173:16.69]I cannot get through this.
[173:19.87]Dog not doing enough DPS.
[173:21.61]Kick him from the raid.
[173:26.84]No, I don't.
[173:31.57]I have a full clip.
[173:33.91]Give me those luck crits.
[173:40.55]There goes his head.
[173:42.89]Removed it from his body.
[173:44.03]He doesn't need it anymore.
[173:45.21]He doesn't need it anymore.
[173:47.09]He can't be thick.
[173:47.91]I'm overburdened.
[173:52.94]Move.
[173:59.50]Why did I pick up the fucking typewriter?
[174:06.41]Where is it?
[174:07.59]Where's the typewriter?
[174:10.29]Throw it into the fucking ground.
[174:14.37]Junk.
[174:15.51]Look at all the junk I have.
[174:17.15]I picked up like two rib cages.
[174:22.04]I don't want any turpentine.
[174:25.92]Drop it.
[174:28.58]Drop the dumb skull.
[174:29.60]I don't care if I need it at some point eventually.
[174:31.58]Drop the toothbrush.
[174:34.18]Two rib cages.
[174:39.71]Where's the typewriter?
[174:41.37]Dumb light bulb.
[174:42.21]How much of this is way, way... Deathclaw hide.
[174:48.13]I don't care.
[174:48.67]Alright, now run!
[174:56.07]Was that even the same person?
[174:59.61]I gotta stop doing that shit, man.
[175:01.41]I pick up everything.
[175:03.54]Look, it's just floating in the air around me.
[175:16.30]It's just floating in the air.
[175:17.52]Let me eat something, too.
[175:31.81]Eat some... Eat two mole rats.
[175:38.93]Load.
[175:40.23]Get in here.
[175:41.75]Who's left?
[175:44.70]Who else is left at this shit show?
[175:48.44]Don't take the fucking umbrella.
[175:49.88]Whatever it was.
[175:51.62]You'll run out of bullets at some point.
[176:01.83]Come on John Kerry Aim better This dog is always in the fucking way Dog food
[176:31.67]Can I eat the dog food?
[176:32.39]I don't want to eat this shit.
[176:40.03]Alright, did I do it?
[176:40.73]I think I beat it.
[176:42.93]Just go up to the top and see what's up there.
[176:47.42]First try.
[176:50.48]What the fuck just happened?
[176:54.82]The game just fucking freaked out.
[177:02.15]Sweet.
[177:03.71]I don't want any of this.
[177:04.31]They're gonna eat the dog food, not the dog.
[177:13.73]The dog food.
[177:26.11]The worst part about it is how much I fucked up the game and the loading times now.
[177:31.59]Or forever.
[177:33.83]They are an eternity.
[177:36.42]Because I had to make my character a giant Attack on Titan character.
[177:40.88]For like five seconds.
[177:41.90]I just want to see if there's anything up here.
[177:54.47]A value.
[177:59.53]Not really.
[178:03.27]They're awful either way.
[178:04.35]I don't remember them being this bad.
[178:05.57]I might have to do a loading screen again.
[178:09.93]Oh, there's some grenades.
[178:28.40]We'll fix and revert all previous console commands.
[178:30.42]We'll fix your speed and loading times.
[178:33.15]Well, that's a load of shit.
[178:37.95]Alright.
[178:38.67]Anything else in here?
[178:39.33]Any more bandits?
[178:41.99]Yeah, they're all dead.
[178:48.59]Is there anything else in here?
[179:03.85]Dog found something?
[179:04.73]What, up top?
[179:12.16]Let me just turn this in.
[179:12.98]I can just fast travel.
[179:21.90]What?
[179:23.12]Okay, that's weird.
[179:23.80]Oh, look at this.
[179:36.43]Alright, let's get that ladder.
[179:44.81]No.
[179:45.21]Go, go.
[179:47.03]Can't even do anything with the terminal anyways.
[179:54.01]Shock and chill.
[179:56.19]Gas mask.
[179:56.94]I'm going to wear that.
[179:58.60]No, I don't want to wear that.
[179:59.64]I'm going to look at my beautiful face.
[180:07.35]Alrighty.
[180:07.77]Did I skip the rifle?
[180:11.28]I'm doing pistols.
[180:13.98]Pistols only.
[180:22.03]Add inventory space 100.
[180:29.53]Well, I can take this opportunity during the loading screens.
[180:32.91]Thank you, Renegade Coaster, Mr. Squishy, Sheep Dagger, Daedalus Doc, It's Showtime, Nextia, I'm Wondrew, I'm Andrew, I'm W. Andrew, Quissant, NickDelta52, ShrimpPPZ, MontyTheMoose, Queem, Minister Moo, Elak18, SnakeThePoets, Walter, WalterPPAK,
[180:55.58]Waylon 147, Chubbish, and Zaliver.
[180:57.78]And also Yulcarps, MortalFAQ.
[181:00.36]I think I got them all.
[181:01.16]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[181:03.08]Some of those were nine months.
[181:06.99]Mr. Squishy was nine months.
[181:07.99]Can't believe it's been nine months since Stardew Valley.
[181:10.51]Jesus, I can't believe it either.
[181:13.21]Life is an ever-turning vial of sand.
[181:19.94]Raddy and Waylon were also nine months both, so thanks, guys.
[181:26.33]Let's fast travel.
[181:30.11]Oh no, I'm not going to fast travel yet.
[181:32.39]Because if I fast travel now, then I'll have to come all the way back here.
[181:35.87]So I'm going to get to Diamond City first, and then fast travel.
[181:38.56]Because that would be stupid.
[181:46.62]Is this reloaded?
[181:47.98]Yes, it is.
[181:53.28]When's Overwatch?
[181:56.00]Not right now.
[181:58.82]What?
[182:01.02]Did someone just call me a psycho?
[182:04.71]No, there's a raider down there.
[182:05.63]Okay, hi, raider.
[182:06.31]What?
[182:12.61]What?
[182:20.39]Diamond City Security.
[182:22.33]I thought he was a bad guy.
[182:26.80]I was about to shoot the hell out of him.
[182:28.08]I remember this one thing with the lady that opens up the door.
[182:35.25]I was about to shoot the security officer.
[182:48.41]Let the super mutants attack you.
[182:50.61]Alright, um, where's the front door?
[182:59.88]Don't you have to, like, walk up to the front door and the lady comes over and is like, I can't believe I can't get in!
[183:05.70]Something along that way.

[185:10.90]No, this is not good.
[185:12.06]This can't save.
[185:12.98]This can't save like this.
[185:15.17]Is that her?
[185:34.04]She's back.

[191:11.01]That's been happening since the very... Even before we added a bunch of weird dumb shit to the game in the very beginning.
[191:17.01]My character was turning around.
[191:18.09]I don't face anybody I have a conversation with ever.

[195:25.05]Alright, I don't know what it is.
[195:29.97]Don't know what that is.
[195:31.21]It's like a Megatron.
[195:44.46]What is it?
[195:44.80]TF?
[195:45.26]What's it?
[195:45.62]T-G-T-G-W?

[196:03.26]Embrace democracy?
[196:06.44]I love how me and my dog just don't even care.
[196:13.28]He's not even attacking me.
[196:24.59]Why does he not care that I exist?
[196:27.13]This random scientist is just like, oh, a reasonable day on the street.
[196:31.15]No big deal.
[196:33.01]Oh, wait a minute.
[196:33.65]What's that thing?

[197:00.42]I'm gonna do like a masturbating move.
[197:05.48]Oh, I fell to town again.
[197:07.04]What am I about to do?
[197:10.09]I gotta stand up and fight.
[197:20.99]Alright, this guy can't die.
[197:22.37]No, he's just leaving.
[197:24.73]Oh, this is good enough.
[197:26.85]I think we're going to go home now.
[197:30.27]See you later.
[197:30.77]I kind of twisted my ankle.
[197:33.79]Shit.
[197:36.43]Where is he going?
[197:37.13]Why are you going all the way around?
[197:38.99]He's getting chased.
[197:43.40]He still has his gun out.
[197:44.72]Where the fuck are you going, man?
[197:46.32]He's coming.
[197:53.99]He can't die.
[197:54.63]I think we're just left with the only people that can't die.
[198:00.80]And I'm sorry.
[198:05.32]Is he an essential NPC?
[198:06.46]Let's find out.
[198:10.76]Let's see how essential you are.
[198:12.08]Let's see how fucking essential you are, buddy.
[198:20.88]Democracy is non-negotiable.
[198:25.13]Hit him!
[198:28.99]Yeah, you ain't so essential now, are you?
[198:36.48]Yeah, he's essential.
[198:37.22]Fuck.
[198:39.24]Alright, time- I leveled up.
[198:41.96]Hey, I did it.
[198:44.55]Alright, let's go.
[198:45.51]Time to move on.
[198:46.49]We had our fun.
[198:55.40]Reload.
[198:55.94]Reload.
[198:57.42]Wait, is that a guy or is it a mannequin?
[199:01.28]Alright, that was fun.
[199:07.46]Fight the robot?
[199:08.22]That doesn't feel right once I have... Oh, yeah.
[199:27.16]I saved us.
[199:29.18]Give me his clothes.
[199:30.89]Okay, let's put my pistol bag on.
[199:33.09]Glow-sided hair trigger pipe pistol.
[199:35.57]I don't think that'll work.
[199:50.44]I need like a magnum.
[199:54.81]Yeah, that was me.
[199:56.43]I did that.
[199:59.33]Alright, let's get some supplies from Dr. Sun.
[200:09.76]Make more funny.
[200:10.78]No, we like have done this like a hundred times.
[200:15.75]You want me to fucking crash my game?
[200:17.37]Fine.
[200:18.45]Let me just save it, so we don't have to see Kyle explode again.
[200:23.87]Try this.
[200:24.27]Okay, but I don't know what it is.
[200:25.45]We'll do it.
[200:36.64]I don't know what this is.
[200:44.84]I'm dead.
[200:45.54]Okay, it killed me.
[200:59.49]Alright, move.
[201:00.71]Let's do a quest.
[201:01.49]Let's do a quest.
[201:05.00]Spawn a thousand deathclaws?
[201:06.24]No, I'll die.
[201:06.76]My game will break.
[201:08.46]My stream will end because it'll lose.
[201:10.80]You know, it'll just lose.
[201:17.59]Oh my fucking god.
[201:22.28]Steal one thing.
[201:24.40]The whole world wants to kill you.
[201:26.72]Crash it, you want me to crash it?
[201:29.87]Resident Sleep, I'm playing the game normally.
[201:33.53]The next time I stream this, I'm gonna put a bunch- a fucking ton of insane mods in it.
[201:43.46]Alright, can we move on now?
[201:46.58]I think I have to talk to somebody in particular.
[201:51.54]Let's do a quest.
[201:55.78]Do I need to talk to that reporter lady again?
[201:59.95]Is that what the problem is?
[202:04.07]Go to Piper's office.
[202:09.25]She's a companion, right?
[202:12.25]Yes, she is.
[202:14.40]Hello, Piper.
[202:15.34]I'm here to escort you.
[202:24.29]Hey, tell me your life story.
[202:25.25]Uh-huh.
[202:25.49]Uh-huh.
[202:38.99]You're all living in rusty shacks.
[202:41.01]Okay.
[202:42.03]Now, the big question.
[202:45.59]I lost family, okay?
[202:47.08]What's their name, Blue?
[202:50.04]You heard wrong.
[202:51.10]Don't.
[202:52.28]My son, Sean.
[202:54.18]Tell me.
[202:55.68]Sure sounds like they might be.
[202:57.00]Not even a baby.
[202:57.98]For the last part of our interview, I'd like to do something different.
[203:00.96]Uh-huh.
[203:01.72]The threat of kidnapping... Wait.
[203:06.38]Pete...
[203:08.10]This would have taken like 25 minutes.
[203:09.00]Do you know how long this would have taken?
[203:10.16]Look, cool.
[203:10.52]Now can you imagine if I had sat there and done that?
[203:12.58]Yeah, Piper would come with me.
[203:14.76]Sure, let's go.
[203:36.28]Why do we keep turning around?
[203:37.50]It's okay, dog.
[203:46.42]Go to Orlin Station.
[203:53.21]Out this way.
[203:53.93]Let's go.
[203:54.39]Why can I not leave?
[204:01.35]Can I please leave this stupid shack?
[204:13.92]Andrew Jackson must rotate.
[204:16.45]Well, that was weird.
[204:19.27]Bye, dog.
[204:20.63]Alright, now what's next?
[204:26.85]Jewel of the Commonwealth.
[204:28.03]Nope.
[204:30.54]Follow the Freedom Trail.
[204:33.34]Let's follow the Freedom Trail.
[204:36.06]Let's go.
[204:36.48]Let's go, Piper.
[204:37.92]Piper.
[204:41.62]Although, let me just see if I can buy a new weapon.
[204:44.06]This weapon sucks.
[204:47.22]Alright, I'm going to do this.
[204:49.30]Because people have not stopped talking about this for three hours.
[204:52.99]I'm saving the game.
[204:53.75]F5, and I'm going to do this smoke grenade.
[204:57.51]QA smoke.
[204:59.23]I don't know what it is, but it just causes everyone to explode.
[205:05.28]I'm going to do it.
[205:07.50]We'll see what happens.
[205:16.23]Don't do it.
[205:16.91]I just did it.
[205:17.33]Okay.
[205:34.01]Why am I in like a nightmare?
[205:39.66]She's here too?
[205:40.60]She made it?
[205:42.26]Cooking station?
[205:44.24]This is a dev room.
[205:49.63]Alright.
[205:51.71]That was cool.
[206:02.18]Let's get in.
[206:04.55]Is there anything to do here?
[206:12.23]Whoa.
[206:13.57]Bunch of ammo in here.
[206:16.85]That's just everything in the whole game is here.
[206:19.78]Okay, well that's... This is kind of bullshit.
[206:24.58]What am I taking the most of?
[206:25.86]No, no, no.
[206:28.44]Reload.
[206:28.94]I'm out of here.
[206:30.82]I'm out.
[206:36.23]I gotta find all the swindle stones.
[206:37.63]That was bad.
[206:38.73]I wanna buy a weapon.
[206:40.57]That's right, I'm the new guy.
[206:42.33]Alright, what do you got?
[206:43.35]Big boy?
[206:43.81]No, I don't want a big boy.
[207:05.03]Heavy 10mm pistol.
[207:06.23]That might be good.
[207:11.10]I think I might want that.
[207:13.68]176.
[207:17.88]Oh, faithful.
[207:21.70]Is this a zapper?
[207:25.35]Pipe bolt action pistol.
[207:26.81]This one might be the thing I need.
[207:33.74]40 damage.
[207:34.09]Do I have... I swear to God, I don't have one of these.
[207:38.69]Hunting rifle.
[207:43.51]It's three grand.
[207:44.64]This guy only has 300 bottle caps.
[207:49.58]Take some fucking dog food.
[207:56.21]I have not peed yet.
[207:56.91]You're right.
[207:57.29]That's a good call.
[208:08.81]Nuka-Cola?
[208:23.95]Squirrel, bitch!
[208:26.93]What is- what is Tato?
[208:30.91]Alright, so bolt action rifle the thing is what I want, right?
[208:33.79]Because it's not automatic or semi-automatic.
[208:37.37]Or would I be better off with the heavy 10mm pistol?
[208:45.44]Piss directly into my mic.
[208:50.92]No, that's gross.
[208:57.94]I don't think I even have one of these.
[208:59.28]Do I?
[209:05.44]Let me just take a look at what I even have.
[209:08.44]What am I using right now?
[209:11.96]Pipe auto pistol.
[209:13.46]Pipe bolt action rifle.
[209:14.78]I don't have a bolt action pistol.
[209:16.34]I'm going to pee my pants.
[209:17.88]Give me that bolt action.
[209:37.15]And... Also... Robot.
[209:47.27]That's all.
[209:47.69]And if he has Stimpaks, I gotta buy them from the fucking dude over there.
[210:07.82]Cigarettes.
[210:10.10]Sell the coffee, sell the cram, cooking oil, clothes hanger.
[210:18.81]Press X. I still have the pajamas.
[210:29.31]That's fine.
[210:32.28]How much ammo do I have in this thing?
[210:40.14]How much does it take?
[210:43.52]I need 308.
[210:44.50]Let me get some 308s, buddy.
[210:49.11]I know face cam because I'm wicked ugly.
[210:52.01]Okay, imagine the ugliest person you've ever seen in your life.
[210:56.16]Double it.
[211:09.63]Now this thing's gonna be a big hurt.
[211:12.03]Nice night, huh?
[211:15.51]Do I have enough for any stim packs?
[211:16.99]Hey, Doc.
[211:18.37]God fucking dammit, I was trying to... And I didn't even save the fucking game, I was trying to... I was trying to just... get to the menu.
[211:39.99]I was trying to click in the menu.
[211:43.25]Who needs a haircut?
[211:44.85]Everyone needs a haircut.
[211:46.55]Step up.
[211:47.61]Oh, my fucking God.
[211:51.23]Doc.
[211:52.45]I was trying to skip this and it ended up doing that.
[211:55.57]Don't dally.
[211:56.73]If you're here to be examined, let's get you examined.
[211:59.43]Yeah, of course.
[212:00.43]Yeah, yeah.
[212:01.91]Barter.
[212:03.09]I need some supplies.
[212:03.91]Fuck off.
[212:06.00]Oh, my God.
[212:07.54]What a pain in my ass.
[212:16.41]I don't even care.
[212:16.95]Just fucking get rid of everything.
[212:22.65]He didn't have that.
[212:23.41]No.
[212:25.06]No, don't accept.
[212:26.38]Cancel that trade.
[212:27.18]I'm just so irritated right now.
[212:31.60]I'm fucking unbelievable.
[212:37.31]I'm trying to skip all the dumb dialog that I've heard a hundred fucking times.
[212:41.59]Then I shot a guy.
[212:50.38]No, don't do that.
[212:52.00]Give me the gun and I'm leaving.
[212:59.69]Give me 308s.
[213:00.07]Get the fuck out of here.
[213:11.77]Take an alarm clock.
[213:13.21]Whatever.
[213:13.71]Just get rid of all this shit until I can do this.
[213:27.98]I just- I've got a Rad-X.
[213:28.94]Who cares?
[213:29.64]It's gone.
[213:29.90]I don't even want the shotgun.
[213:35.13]I don't want any of this stuff.
[213:44.07]Get rid of my jumpsuit.
[213:49.18]Get rid of some fucking Taitos.
[213:53.59]Accept.
[213:54.15]Go.
[213:54.75]Don't care.
[213:56.33]Don't shoot anyone.
[214:01.81]Save the game.
[214:04.89]Why am I doing pipe pistols?
[214:06.27]Because I'm doing the bolt action pipe pistol.
[214:10.23]And I'm a fucking moron.
[214:12.21]You sound pissed.
[214:13.98]I kind of am.
[214:16.58]For as long as the loading screens are and how much I'm just dicking around in the game.
[214:22.99]It is annoying.
[214:33.28]I'm going to the Freedom Trail right now.
[214:35.20]Heading my way there.
[214:45.45]Everything is fine.
[214:46.25]Everything is fine.
[214:54.46]Stop being stuck.
[214:55.10]Alright, Freedom Trail.
[215:03.77]Let's go.
[215:08.31]God loves ugly.
[215:09.95]What?
[215:15.55]What are you talking about, buddy?
[215:22.37]I want to see the Freedom Trail.
[215:26.02]Follow the freedom trail.
[215:28.76]Where does it start?
[215:35.12]Diamond City.
[215:35.88]Does it start in the Diamond City Market?
[215:38.62]Doesn't it start like... I guess maybe it just starts here then.
[215:43.91]Where does the freedom trail start?
[215:49.97]I'm going to pee my pants.
[215:50.91]I got to go.
[215:51.71]I'll be right back.
[215:52.79]I keep forgetting about it.
[217:31.70]I'm back.
[217:34.32]Hello.
[217:34.48]Okay, um... I'm gonna... I think I'm going to call it a night here in like another 10 or 15 minutes.
[217:39.64]I think.
[217:39.90]Oh, I'm gonna burp.
[217:40.70]I'm gonna make a loud noise.
[218:06.18]What do I need?
[218:15.12]P-Joke is 16 years old.
[218:20.57]I'll do another thing with perception.
[218:26.27]Why not?
[218:32.53]You're the worst player playing this game.
[218:34.75]I'm going to be real with you.
[218:35.85]I'll be real.
[218:36.49]You guys want to be real?
[218:38.75]I think Fallout 4 is the worst Fallout game.
[218:40.77]That's how real I'll be.
[218:44.80]I'm just going to be real.
[218:47.58]I was having much more fun in New Vegas.
[218:50.84]Which I'm sure is painfully obvious.
[218:55.98]I thought that was just a picture of a painting of a naked person.
[219:00.56]Like there's their head and there's their like naked body.
[219:05.40]Look at that naked guy.
[219:08.30]Too real, too real, too real.
[219:12.48]So like when we first started playing like two hours ago, I was like, oh this is like fun.
[219:15.79]And then I just remembered this is Fallout 4.
[219:18.35]And I was like, eh.
[219:19.19]I'm not really feeling it.
[219:22.93]I probably will play more New Vegas now that I think about it.
[219:28.95]Let's go get in trouble.
[219:33.48]I don't think this game is bad.
[219:34.80]Oh, she's in trouble.
[219:45.68]Shoot her out of his hand.
[219:46.40]Shoot her out of his hand.
[219:47.87]Why did I stream it?
[219:58.07]Because I never really played it that much.
[220:01.15]I played it for like about six or seven hours before.
[220:13.81]Let's go to the freedom trail.
[220:15.53]I want to actually, like, do that before I get out of here.
[220:19.40]Or I could just, like, explore, too.
[220:20.52]I haven't done much of that.
[220:29.04]When freedom calls, you know.
[220:35.15]Alright.
[220:36.79]So now... Over here.
[220:41.57]Let's go!
[220:51.77]Can I wrap all the way around?
[220:54.71]Do I have my other gun equipped?
[220:55.77]My cool new gun?
[221:00.09]There it is.
[221:02.53]I don't want to waste these bullets.
[221:03.53]There's a lot of potential for me to just throw these in the trash.
[221:14.30]What kind of tea do I drink?
[221:15.08]I drink usually... If I'm going to drink tea, that's...
[221:18.96]Mmm, I like rooibos.
[221:19.86]I like red tea.
[221:21.68]I like green tea.
[221:24.02]Or it's coffee.
[221:25.03]It's usually coffee.
[221:29.69]What the hell is that?
[221:31.63]What the hell is what?
[221:32.77]Me walking?
[221:34.35]Me running?
[221:39.33]I think you're concerned about the Diamond City security guard.
[221:41.93]This shouldn't take long.
[221:49.79]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[221:51.41]Forget about those people.
[221:52.39]Let's go.
[221:52.73]We got places to be.
[221:54.43]The Boston Public Library.
[222:05.16]My game's running like shit too.
[222:24.22]How close are we to the Freedom Trail?
[222:25.66]How close?
[222:27.98]Somewhat close.
[222:35.44]New Vegas 2, newer Vegas.
[222:38.18]Is Obsidian making the next Fallout game?
[222:42.18]Is it going to be like Fallout 4 Dash?
[222:45.02]Something?
[222:51.80]I remember this.
[222:52.44]I do remember this.
[222:54.71]This thing in the middle of the lake.
[222:59.51]Okay, you gotta activate the chain.
[223:01.63]You can't just jump over it.
[223:04.69]Yeah, that's a guy right there.
[223:06.41]That's a bad guy.
[223:07.95]Want me to show you?
[223:09.62]Bad guy.
[223:17.78]He's gonna kill us all.
[223:25.38]I'm not actually going to be able to kill this.
[223:27.42]I think I'm going to be, yeah, we're just dead.
[223:29.42]He's going to throw rocks at me.
[223:35.78]Why was I still in the air moving my hands around?
[223:42.62]I was like swimming in the air.
[223:51.31]Pea shooter.
[223:54.68]No, we can't move to the Freedom Trail, it's this idiot.
[223:59.83]Hey, look who it is!
[224:03.71]It's the Torbot!
[224:09.63]Make him fight a Deathclaw?
[224:10.63]Oh, that's a good idea.
[224:11.23]Who do you think's gonna win?
[224:13.25]Uh, alright, is it gonna be the Queen Bee thing, or him?
[224:24.08]What do you guys think?
[224:30.90]Let's see who wins.
[224:35.44]Go for it!
[224:37.07]Fight to the death!
[224:39.65]No, don't follow me!
[224:41.51]Fight him!
[224:46.91]Here we go!
[224:47.69]Fight him!
[224:50.51]Come on, this is just like one of those Japanese movies!
[224:56.14]Swan is getting his ass kicked.
[225:04.11]Holy fuck, Swan, you suck.
[225:07.41]Swan's dead.
[225:08.23]And now it's your turn, my pretty.
[225:11.35]Alright, I'm gonna go loot his body and run.
[225:32.81]I'm so dead.
[225:33.75]He's going to catch up to me.
[225:43.46]Alright.
[225:45.04]I think I'm going to call it a night.
[225:48.70]I got to prepare tomorrow.
[225:51.80]Because I have something potentially special to stream on Thursday.
[225:56.88]Or Friday.
[225:59.27]I might even do it tomorrow.
[226:02.09]I might do it tomorrow.
[226:05.87]I'm going to make a bunch of people in WWE 2K17.
[226:10.62]And try to fuck around with it and do like a career mode with Glue Man.
[226:16.06]We're doing that tomorrow.
[226:17.66]Or, if not tomorrow, then Thursday.
[226:19.26]Depends on if I can play Watch Dogs 2 or not.
[226:22.32]With Etalyx.
[226:24.92]But tomorrow, I need to prepare for that.
[226:30.94]We'll do some rumbles.
[226:32.56]We'll have a lot of fun.
[226:37.81]But yeah, thank you so much for coming out, guys.
[226:41.55]But it's going to take me like at least a day or two to make all these people.
[226:46.51]So who knows who the hell you're going to see.
[226:47.57]You're going to see a bunch of random new people.
[226:48.93]A Jerma Rumble 5 is going to be like on stream, essentially, in the game.
[226:53.29]Not really.
[226:56.06]Not necessarily.
[226:58.84]But yeah.
[227:01.16]Uh, Fallout 4 was fun.
[227:02.10]The first, like, couple hours, or the first, like, two hours were fun.
[227:04.20]And I'm, I'm not gonna lie to you guys.
[227:06.72]It, uh, it's, I started to get a little bored after we had, like, our fun.
[227:10.36]After we did, like, the fun dumb shit that we typically do, it was just kind of like, ah, I don't really wanna, don't really wanna play Fallout 4.
[227:16.08]Uh, so I'll be as, as real as I can.
[227:20.40]It's not that it's a bad game, I just think it's, uh, I had much more fun in New Vegas.
[227:26.71]I played New Vegas a lot more.
[227:30.45]Take care, guys.
[227:31.85]Did I miss any new subs?
[227:32.83]Let's see.
[227:42.32]When's the Rumble stream?
[227:43.16]It's going to be probably this week.
[227:45.04]Tomorrow, I'm going to be sitting in my seat here.
[227:47.56]I'm just making a bunch of characters.
[227:50.20]If it doesn't happen on Thursday or Friday, then it'll happen on Tuesday or next week.
[227:56.87]But thank you to KyleTS8, CGFPDN, RenegadeCoaster, MrSquishy, SheepDagger, It'sChoTime, DaDallasDonk, and Nextia.

[228:29.63]No, I had more fun playing New Vegas.
[228:32.53]I did.
[228:33.77]That's why I kind of got into it.
[228:35.57]I was trying to get... This is the same thing that happened to me the last time I played Fallout 4.
[228:40.26]I played it for a little while, I had some fun, and I couldn't get into playing it.
[228:45.74]New Vegas?
[228:46.24]When we were playing New Vegas, I was into playing New Vegas.
[228:52.60]I streamed that game for like what 15 20 hours something like that and I was like super into it I I don't want to like pretend to be into something that I'm not into which is absolutely what would happen that was what was happening the last like 45 minutes of the stream so uh we'll see where we go tomorrow but yeah thanks uh polo autumn for 500 thank you uh thank you retard Joe
