[01:29.72]Is Mickey Mouse?
[01:33.04]Or is that Mickey Mouse?
[01:33.94]I don't know.
[01:36.50]Hi, everybody!
[01:38.57]Welcome back to Dark Souls.
[01:40.87]Dark Souls 3.
[01:44.17]Pre-order now.
[01:46.83]And get the exclusive grandma gear.
[01:49.49]Oh, shit.
[01:49.95]Hold on.
[01:54.84]What button do I have to press to get off of the Elmo Mickey Mouse screen?
[02:02.34]Is it one of these buttons?
[02:05.29]It's one of these buttons.
[02:06.39]Here's the button.
[02:09.39]And let there be light.
[02:18.38]Okey-dokey.
[02:21.02]Good afternoon.
[02:22.60]Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24.18]Hello.
[02:24.50]My name's Greg.
[02:31.27]So we left off as the harvesting Reaper grandmother.
[02:40.91]We left off in a fairly odd spot because
[02:46.70]I just beat the... If you missed it, if you're just joining us, if you missed it, last night, I got to a wall.
[02:56.35]I got to a boss that I could not really beat.
[02:58.05]It took me like 15 tries to beat the boss.
[03:00.73]I was very upset about it.
[03:01.81]I was not happy.
[03:02.93]I was coming up with every excuse in the book as to why I didn't like the boss, why I didn't like what was happening, but eventually I beat it.
[03:11.28]Ah, the French...
[03:12.86]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence and Saturn Z with three months It was a witch lady which let me this bonfire she was up there I think So we need to go this way down into the maybe it is actually this way There were at least two places that I did not go I
[03:39.10]I have not explored fully.
[03:41.58]I kind of would like to go back and see what I missed in the older areas.
[03:48.90]For instance, remember the blue katana guy?
[03:51.67]The blue, like, I turned my big, beautiful katana sword into a light beam and I couldn't beat him?
[03:58.09]Kind of want to go back and kill that guy.
[04:03.41]Serious?
[04:05.55]This is like a... Who is this guy?
[04:08.53]This dude's got a ton of health.
[04:15.43]Shit.
[04:16.11]I'm trying to discuss what's happening here and this guy just creeps up on me.
[04:19.50]Alright, we're going full on reap.
[04:34.04]This is a slightly difficult NPC.
[04:39.52]Nice dodge.
[04:44.49]He's not really doing that much damage to me though.
[05:02.61]Oh, that's so stupid.
[05:03.85]That would not happen with a scythe.
[05:07.02]You don't, like, swing a scythe through somebody's chest.
[05:11.66]That didn't really do any damage to him.
[05:16.08]I'm doing more damage to him just swinging.
[05:18.56]Normally.
[05:23.34]See you later.
[05:24.84]Okay, that was odd.
[05:30.73]Didn't seem to drop anything either.
[05:35.48]Okay.
[05:39.26]Uh, whatever.
[05:44.23]Is he down here?
[05:46.77]Paladin's Ashes.
[05:50.23]I think I can give that to somebody in town.
[05:52.41]Little shop lady.
[05:56.48]You don't want to get spoiled any further, so see you around.
[05:58.72]Take care, man.
[06:00.02]I totally understand.
[06:01.22]I totally get you.
[06:09.54]Guess I'll have a ton of health.
[06:13.44]Hey, dandy floss.
[06:15.48]Welcome back.
[06:16.18]In a row.
[06:16.46]Pastel Cube!
[06:17.08]Both of these.
[06:18.04]Thanks for the subs, dude.
[06:23.24]Thanks for the re-subscriptions.
[06:41.31]I'll get him.
[06:42.37]I'm gonna get him.
[06:49.22]I'm gonna get him, Lechie.
[06:51.68]Every time they don't... Like, Paul Bearer, like, pumps me up.
[06:55.44]I have to do it.
[06:56.24]Like, anytime I hear him scream that, it has to happen.
[07:05.68]Welcome, dude.
[07:06.03]Thanks.
[07:07.49]Spider Shield.
[07:10.39]Am I crazy or should I not be in this area?
[07:16.58]These guys are actual NPC mini-bosses.
[07:20.34]Something tells me my shitty grandmother character shouldn't be here right now.
[07:25.68]But whatever, I guess so.
[07:27.90]They give me a lot of souls.
[07:39.09]God, those phantoms.
[07:40.97]Every time I see another player phantom... You are much faster than... You're an arrow, dog.
[07:52.34]They've, like, injected you with all kinds of shit.
[07:55.62]Okay, hold on.
[07:56.44]Easy, easy.
[07:57.10]Don't fucking blow this.
[07:59.95]He's like... What is he doing?
[08:03.31]What the heck, man?
[08:06.63]Hey, what the heck, dog?
[08:09.30]Yeah, he's got like adrenaline in him.
[08:11.35]They coated those arrows with adrenaline.
[08:13.97]Stick him into the dogs.
[08:16.27]It's nonsense.
[08:23.77]Archer dudes.
[08:27.47]Alright.
[08:29.61]I tried to lock onto the archer guy.
[08:31.73]Apparently there's a dog here.
[08:33.29]And decided to lock me onto him.
[08:41.48]Annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying.
[08:53.32]Two over there.
[08:56.45]Two over in the sweet spot.
[09:02.67]Wow.
[09:05.56]He shot me through the trees.
[09:12.84]Ugh.
[09:15.76]He just bit me in the face.
[09:16.70]I'm in trouble here.
[09:17.36]Alright, I'm going back to bed.
[09:23.10]I'm gonna rehash this, you know?
[09:27.16]What do I prefer at this point?
[09:28.58]This or Bloodborne?
[09:31.26]Hmm.
[09:34.12]That's a good question.
[09:36.84]That is a really good question.
[09:39.12]I'm going to have to say Bloodborne.
[09:42.34]So far.
[09:44.44]I think.
[09:47.29]So far.
[09:53.15]If you were to tell me to rank, like, how I feel about, like, Dark Souls versus Bloodborne, I guess, in a sense.
[09:59.11]This is very close.
[10:01.84]But I still think, at least, like, in the first five to ten hours...
[10:07.03]I think Bloodborne may be a slightly better game, in my opinion.
[10:11.91]In my opinion.
[10:15.73]No, I haven't gone through the whole thing, so I can't really give you a... And that's actually a pretty biased opinion.
[10:22.52]Because I see Bloodborne as one of my favorite games ever made.
[10:26.66]It's definitely in the top five.
[10:28.84]Maybe even the top three.
[10:34.88]So it's hard to say that.
[10:36.00]It's like, hey, can you compare your favorite game ever made to this one?
[10:42.44]It's going to be kind of biased.
[10:49.84]Thankfully, those NPCs are gone.
[10:51.24]I don't have to deal with them anymore.
[10:56.75]I wish I could put a ring on that maybe phased through trees.
[11:00.81]I'd bump into them all the time.
[11:11.79]Oh, secret.
[11:12.89]Oh, secret ahead, huh?
[11:16.04]Don't lie to me.
[11:19.62]Didn't I just... I didn't kill this dog.
[11:25.62]Apparently not.
[11:30.03]But this game is on the same engine as Bloodborne, but it's... They're very close.
[11:34.75]They're very similar games, but not quite.
[11:47.38]He's like, weird imaginary dogs just keep appearing out of my brain.
[11:50.78]Are these real enemies?
[11:51.92]Or do I keep imagining that they're here?
[11:53.84]Because after I kill one, another one just appears in my brain.
[12:19.38]I wanted to hit you.
[12:20.10]I didn't want to lock onto you.
[12:26.56]Okay.
[12:29.25]Let's look around.
[12:33.11]The Witcher.
[12:33.43]I played The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 1.
[12:37.04]And I think I opened up the menu for The Witcher 3.
[12:40.77]I think that's all I did.
[12:42.15]In fact, I don't know if I've ever double-clicked The Witcher 3 on Steam.
[12:47.71]I don't think I did.
[12:52.49]Game of the Year, though.
[12:53.19]It's gotta be like Game of the Year.
[12:54.25]It has to be.
[12:54.70]Did I miss anything over here?
[13:05.26]Oh...
[13:10.70]Take it slow, Grandma.
[13:14.57]I want to take off the Grandma outfit, but it's too perfect.
[13:19.31]Even if I take 40% more damage, it's too perfect to take it off.
[13:23.87]I have to immerse myself as the character, otherwise I can't play the game.
[13:33.18]Hey, you missed.
[13:36.66]Note to self dude, don't light yourself on fire and run at somebody.
[13:42.07]Because you're probably going to die before you get to them.
[13:48.39]I think I'm supposed to be here.
[13:50.63]Wasn't there a big discussion?
[13:53.63]Oh shit.
[13:55.96]Cathedral of the Deep.
[13:56.84]That kind of rings a bell.
[13:57.66]I feel like people were talking about it.
[14:04.22]Oh, I missed.
[14:06.33]Oh, shit!
[14:06.99]They're all lighting themselves on fire!
[14:13.28]God!
[14:14.82]Oh, God.
[14:17.72]Stop it.
[14:18.08]You guys are crazy.
[14:19.04]Don't do that.
[14:19.64]I didn't know you all did that.
[14:23.52]I thought just one of your dumb friends did it.
[14:27.22]There's one guy left.
[14:27.92]This is the smart one.
[14:31.48]He came over and was just like, did they do the thing where they left themselves on fire again?
[14:35.94]I told them not to do that.
[14:38.79]Use your axes and shields.
[14:41.01]Ooh, that's the shard.
[14:46.59]Cool.
[14:53.41]I heard something.
[14:54.87]What did I hear?
[14:57.02]I hear footsteps.
[14:57.74]I'm going up.
[15:13.55]Alright, well, the dead are... holy.
[15:18.47]That was... surprising.
[15:24.07]This is... this is really scary.
[15:27.33]I feel like I'm watching Ghostbusters.
[15:29.37]When they all come off the ship.
[15:35.62]And they take three hits.
[15:45.79]Although they don't really do much.
[16:00.27]Easier spread with a one-handed version of it.
[16:05.03]You can get a more horizontal swing.
[16:07.88]Oh, God.
[16:09.98]Oh, God.
[16:10.58]Which way?
[16:11.06]Which way?
[16:14.44]What am I doing?
[16:15.69]Oh, my God.
[16:16.13]They're in every corner.
[16:19.31]Hold on.
[16:19.51]Hold on a second.
[16:21.13]Hold on a second.
[16:21.77]Slow down.
[16:29.62]This is actually scary.
[16:31.14]There's so many of them, and they're so slow, but they're so menacing.
[16:36.52]Do they even attack?
[16:52.77]Yeah, they do.
[16:53.61]They do.
[16:54.23]They do.
[16:54.99]Listen to me, son!
[16:57.49]I'm your dad!
[17:03.31]Welcome Corny Mist.
[17:06.88]Thanks for the sub.
[17:07.42]Appreciate it.
[17:10.48]Welcome to the... Welcome to the group.
[17:16.78]I have a feeling that they do not stop spawning.
[17:20.32]That is just a feeling I have.
[17:21.63]I think it's just... I'm just going to run around.
[17:24.47]They're pretty slow.
[17:27.77]They don't seem to be that much of a threat.
[17:32.45]I'm going to go this way.
[17:38.95]Stick the whole side through.
[17:41.33]A store of greatsword.
[17:42.55]I'm going to go for a little bit of a run.
[17:50.10]Go for a little jog here.
[17:51.22]Somebody just burped at me.
[17:57.29]I heard a Barney from The Simpsons burp.
[18:02.84]Seriously, we went from the jock-shocking shock-jockers to the group.
[18:07.00]Talk about a downgrade.
[18:10.04]Look, it's hard for me to come up with, like... When I play Dark Souls, you gotta remember, my brain, all of my energy, all of my mental capacity is going to playing the game.
[18:19.22]So, what you're getting talking and, like, commentary-wise right now is, like, 8% of my... 8 percentile of my brain...
[18:28.80]Uh, chill guy.
[18:30.16]Okay, I run this way.
[18:31.54]Uh, snowy today.
[18:37.33]Me.
[18:37.93]Me like Reaper.
[18:41.27]Reaper fun.
[18:44.77]I don't like boss.
[18:45.63]Boss too hard.
[18:48.38]Dave stupid.
[18:50.28]That's pretty much what you get when I play a game like this.
[19:02.47]Oh, there's a new guy.
[19:03.23]This guy has a guy coming out of the guy.
[19:06.85]He's got a lot of health.
[19:14.51]Okay.
[19:16.21]I don't like this place.
[19:17.81]This place scares me.
[19:20.43]I'm actually kind of weirded out in this area.
[19:22.66]I don't like it.
[19:23.96]I don't like these weird skeleton people.
[19:35.83]Oh, no.
[19:47.13]Locked in the corner.
[19:48.65]Bad camera.
[19:49.59]Bad camera.
[19:50.97]Don't be bad, camera.
[19:52.19]Camera is being bad.
[19:57.14]I accidentally hit this moron over here on the left.
[20:07.25]Okay.
[20:08.85]I probably should skedaddle.
[20:14.23]Seeing as how I'm very low on flasks and... Oh, there's an item down there.
[20:20.96]I did get another shard.
[20:26.66]I'm just bleeding right now.
[20:28.88]What is hurting me?
[20:32.71]What cut me?
[20:34.45]These guys have claws?
[20:35.39]I'm going to have to get that another time.
[20:46.15]Shit.
[20:46.92]Oh, please just push him off the edge.
[20:49.90]I'm just trying to kick him right there.
[20:54.28]Get out of here.
[20:57.38]I'm going to bleed.
[20:59.52]Might be time to bone it up here, guys.
[21:02.56]Yeah, I think it's time for a bone Although there might be a bonfire in the building I'm just gonna run yeah, we're just gonna run in the building You know what those guys look like they're wearing one of those Halloween costumes where it's one person, but they look like two people I
[21:30.63]Forget it.
[21:31.55]Forget it.
[21:32.97]Whoa, all this stuff.
[21:43.77]Oh, shit!
[21:44.33]What ki- Oh, no!
[21:45.33]The bleed!
[21:45.93]The bleed killed me.
[21:51.11]Somebody's throwing spears.
[21:55.94]Alright.
[21:57.76]The grandma gear is going to have to come off.
[22:00.06]Unfortunately.
[22:00.72]I'm going back to Kylo Ren.
[22:16.83]Hmm...
[22:25.85]It's just too dangerous to walk around like that.
[22:37.38]Alright, let's go get those souls.
[22:46.42]Actually, I'm going to upgrade the flask.
[22:53.87]Just got here to see grandma take her clothes off.
[23:02.66]Yeah, she did.
[23:08.07]Game crashed.
[24:00.00]What a crock of shit.
[24:01.04]Alright, I'm gonna tell you guys, I'm gonna tell you guys.
[24:05.32]This is... first story.
[24:08.08]I haven't had a video game crash so bad that it hard-locked my entire computer, and I had to hold the button down.
[24:16.67]I'm crashing again.
[24:17.23]I'm crashing again.
[24:18.33]I'm crashing again, unbelievable.
[24:22.05]No way.
[24:24.05]No way did- am I- am I really crashed again?
[24:35.18]No, it's okay.
[24:36.32]Hold on a second.
[24:44.65]Is it... Is it audio?
[24:51.78]Oh, there we go.
[24:53.48]What in God's green gravy.
[24:58.88]Hold on.
[25:07.12]Yeah, my lighting is already on low.
[25:08.78]Okay, now I can hear it.
[25:13.56]Okay.
[25:19.19]So, let me continue my funny story.
[25:23.57]So, my funny story is this.
[25:26.85]I have never, I don't think in the entire time I've ever owned this computer, crashed so bad that I had to hold...
[25:34.74]The button down.
[25:36.24]The power button on my computer.
[25:37.38]I had to hard reset my computer.
[25:40.13]What was the last thing I said?
[25:41.39]Did I like say anything?
[25:42.33]Give me a break.
[26:02.06]That's the last thing I said?
[26:06.94]I don't know, people are asking me.
[26:08.90]People are asking me what game do I like better, this or Bloodborne.
[26:12.68]Bloodborne didn't have these fucking problems.
[26:19.33]Where the hell is it?
[26:23.63]Yeah, I have lighting.
[26:25.29]Why did it go back to high?
[26:29.04]You guys saw me do this yesterday.
[26:30.44]Everything was on low.
[26:33.70]Why did lighting go back to high?
[26:39.64]You know what I mean?
[26:40.46]I swear to God, this is all... I did this yesterday.
[26:43.04]I don't even remember Bloodborne doing this.
[26:54.08]Fucking Namkai Bando.
[27:03.63]Namkai Bando strikes again.
[27:13.59]I have one question.
[27:14.47]Should I get Bloodborne with all the DLC or Dark Souls 3 now and grab its DLC down the road?
[27:19.22]Don't ask me that question now.
[27:21.12]Don't ask me that question now.
[27:22.66]I'll give you an answer.
[27:26.46]Bloodborne and the DLC.
[27:27.48]Don't ask me that question now.
[27:28.98]After what just happened.
[27:34.30]Okay, here we go.
[27:42.40]And Namco Bundo has the balls to release this shit three weeks late.
[27:50.24]And you gotta fuck out.
[27:51.12]I gotta hold my power button down on my computer?
[27:55.09]That is what we call uncalled for.
[28:02.34]This is a Dark Souls 3 rage moment, and it has nothing to do with the video game Dark Souls.
[28:09.38]If somebody came in right now, a brand new viewer that just came in, is probably like, oh man, he probably died to the boss like 12 times.
[28:17.05]No, I died to the fucking computer.
[28:20.13]Engine.
[28:21.27]Port.
[28:25.11]Infused my shit.
[28:26.87]I don't even care anymore.
[28:29.41]Let me get like fucking a thousand percent damage.
[28:31.49]Give me like ten thousand percent damage.
[28:44.07]No, I won't do that right now.
[28:49.37]Death by computer engine port.
[28:50.91]Yeah.
[28:54.13]It's bullshit.
[28:57.84]A real Dark Souls pro would have no trouble pulling the hard reset maneuver.
[29:01.12]It's a pretty standard technique necessary for speedruns.
[29:07.42]No, you can't.
[29:07.96]That's not a death.
[29:09.56]You can't add that to a death count.
[29:11.98]No, it does count.
[29:16.70]Death count.
[29:17.38]Alright, I'm gonna go get my souls.
[29:23.25]You guys are counting Jupiters too?
[29:24.89]Why?
[29:29.13]Why are you counting Jupiters?
[29:32.49]At least there's more Jupiters than deaths.
[29:34.97]Okay guys, be careful.
[29:41.71]You might need to hold the power button on your computer.
[29:47.27]Oh, I am... We started off on a bad note here.
[29:51.75]I am already not happy.
[29:54.11]You know what I mean?
[29:55.15]I just hit that guy at the end.
[30:13.31]Jupiter count.
[30:14.88]Alright, what's going to... Are there going to be more... Somebody make a prediction.
[30:18.32]Will there be more deaths or more Jupiters by the end?
[30:21.00]Like, what's going to be the higher count?
[30:24.26]I got a feeling it's going to be Jupiter.
[30:25.66]Because I just said that.
[30:29.20]I just talked about it.
[30:30.84]Anytime you talk about it, it means the thing you talked about is the one that's... I thought that dog was a tree.
[30:35.86]I thought you were a tree.
[30:41.14]Back around this way.
[30:41.98]You can't shoot me when you're down here.
[30:43.50]Yeah, you cannot kill what is already dead!
[30:46.78]I wish I could- they're going like one, two, three, four.
[31:02.03]Will you guys stop working together?
[31:03.35]God.
[31:09.09]Uh...
[31:12.44]Alright.
[31:13.26]I think I've come to a very strong realization.
[31:16.18]I'm stuck.
[31:17.83]I'm stuck.
[31:18.23]I cannot move.
[31:21.45]I think the scythe might need to get thrown into the garbage can.
[31:25.53]I think it's time.
[31:29.80]Because it takes a thousand years to swing this for not very much damage.
[31:35.22]I wanted to be the Grim Reaper.
[31:37.40]But it looks like that ain't gonna happen.
[31:41.28]I just gotta... Yeah.
[31:43.48]I'm going to put this thing into a fucking wood chipper.
[31:53.18]I'm telling you, the crash shit just really threw me off.
[32:06.01]Where's the sword I got?
[32:09.43]16 strength.
[32:09.79]That's actually pretty good.
[32:11.75]I can't even put it on yet.
[32:13.99]Let's see what it looks like.
[32:14.79]This thing is wicked slow too though.
[32:25.92]Although it does have C scaling and dexterity.
[32:36.97]We need to keep this on for now.
[32:46.53]For now, this has to stay on.
[32:58.73]Oh look, I got my 300 souls back.
[33:00.94]Oh my god.
[33:15.91]I don't know why you're so hard for me to hit at the moment.
[33:18.95]I need to like... I'm pretty much using a projectile right now.
[33:33.55]These guys move so fast and they attack so fast.
[33:36.76]I have to aim like I'm shooting a rocket at them.
[34:04.06]Sometimes I think about it would have been cool to be bow guy Because there are a lot of people that stand back and shoot shit at you in this game That I kind of want to be one of these guys
[34:27.22]I think it would be cool to be one of the guys that shoots in a straight line over and over again.
[34:33.01]Then I could just sit back and not have to worry about hitting 200 mile per hour jumping dogs.
[34:50.07]I could just shoot the dog in the face when it's back there.
[34:57.56]That's how you know the game's broken you.
[34:59.00]I want to be a minion.
[35:00.76]Yeah, how do I sign up for this job?
[35:13.15]Now this job would suck.
[35:15.78]You just miss a bunch of arrows and a guy kills you.
[35:18.70]Probably doesn't pay very well either.
[35:30.64]Well, my souls are gone, so... I'm gonna go back.
[35:37.74]I want to go... Because I wanted to go the other way.
[35:39.94]I want to check the other direction.
[35:41.34]Because there were at least two places I could have gone.
[35:44.48]I feel like I'd rather get more leveled and better geared.
[35:50.53]Not a scythe.
[35:52.51]This doesn't seem to be doing me any favors at the moment.
[36:01.03]Uh, it was back here, right?
[36:06.18]Where was it, like... I think it was... That was the Crystal Sage.
[36:15.16]Where was, like, that swamp?
[36:19.36]Here?
[36:22.14]I think it was here.
[36:24.15]Because remember the crab people?
[36:25.57]There was another place I could go where the crab people were.
[36:32.10]I remember turning around and running from the giant crab and just finding that building.
[36:41.42]Because down there is the Crystal Sage, so over here... There's the crab people land, right?
[36:47.63]Yes.
[36:54.59]So... Yep, I can see items that I didn't get over there.
[36:57.27]I'm gonna go that way.
[37:01.41]He talks about having glasses but doesn't show us.
[37:03.41]I don't want you to see my glasses face.
[37:04.85]I don't like it.
[37:06.81]How do I get up here?
[37:13.57]What, like, secret is it to get up there?
[37:15.01]What if I go over here?
[37:34.18]Off, like, the wall?
[37:35.09]Can I, like, run off?
[37:35.63]Can I do, like, a wall jump?
[37:40.49]Looks like this is the little lip I can get up, potentially.
[37:44.43]I'm gonna go off that rock.
[37:48.98]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[37:49.72]Okay, so this is a building I did not go into.
[38:01.47]Right?
[38:01.97]Yeah.
[38:02.19]Because I don't remember big guy with the turkey hair.
[38:04.44]The big turkey guy.
[38:07.22]I don't remember the big chicken wing guy.
[38:08.52]Holy crap.
[38:27.01]Is the other one de-aggroed?
[38:28.45]Yeah.
[38:29.35]Holy shit, he was not de-aggroed!
[38:33.97]Fucking turkey tip over here.
[38:35.90]Where was he that whole time?
[38:36.78]Was he just watching me fight him?
[38:37.92]Yeah, you can take him for a little bit.
[38:47.64]Wow, that's a lot of reach.
[39:00.42]I thought I was going to catch him.
[39:01.72]You guys, seriously.
[39:14.02]It's going to take forever.
[39:20.33]Hopefully I don't walk into any crabs.
[39:27.55]I wouldn't call this a fair fight.
[39:29.94]Where's my Michelin Man?
[39:33.17]Can't he just walk around with me the whole time?
[39:44.31]It was worth a shot.
[39:45.87]Whoa, I just... What is that guy doing?
[39:47.35]What are you doing?
[39:48.43]Stop that.
[39:50.51]Stop... No, he's doing it again.
[39:51.73]Stop that.
[39:52.05]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[39:52.66]Don't... Stop praying.
[39:56.08]He's going to do it again, isn't he?
[39:57.62]He so desperately wants to do this.
[40:07.15]What the fuck is he doing?
[40:08.55]He's doing it again.
[40:10.17]I thought I killed him.
[40:10.91]I thought he was dead.
[40:12.21]Oh my god.
[40:15.03]No way.
[40:16.35]You're telling me he's still alive?
[40:21.10]He's gonna keep doing that, right?
[40:26.00]Oh my god.
[40:30.48]This is...
[40:38.59]Yeah, and I screamed at him.
[40:40.69]And I have to heal.
[40:41.55]I just do my prayers every time.
[40:48.39]Is the guy with the sword gonna do that too?
[40:49.76]You know, in a PvP situation, you guys would be chastised for what you're doing right now.
[41:04.01]Need two guys to kill one guy?
[41:05.79]Wow, scrubs.
[41:14.25]They both just... You guys are so desperate.
[41:17.15]We just need to chill the fuck out.
[41:35.12]Finally.
[41:41.95]Nah, I'm not gonna try any funny business here.
[41:43.41]Just kill him.
[41:46.71]Much easier when you're not together.
[41:47.93]Okay, that's a great sword.
[41:54.43]Huh.
[42:05.04]D and D. Great club.
[42:15.90]Whoa, it's me three-eyed welcome, dude Welcome to the the grand complaining stream see what we do here is we just complain My next stream title is gonna be the grand complainer oh
[42:41.43]But you gotta give me a little bit of slack.
[42:43.16]I started off a little bit angry.
[42:44.54]Because of, uh... Unscrupulous.
[42:48.92]Is that even the right word?
[42:50.88]What does unscrupulous mean?
[42:52.96]Is that a word?
[42:53.54]Scrupulous.
[42:54.08]Not unscrupulous.
[42:56.53]I don't know.
[42:59.71]Doesn't that mean you're not good with money?
[43:02.65]That's frugal.
[43:03.93]No, frugal means you're good with money.
[43:05.41]You don't spend it.
[43:07.74]Unscrupulous.
[43:11.21]Is that even a real word?
[43:12.67]Is unscrupulous a word?
[43:19.02]It's a word.
[43:19.78]What does it mean?
[43:21.30]I don't know.
[43:21.64]What the fuck does that word mean?
[43:30.29]You know when you say a word enough times and it just doesn't even feel like a real word anymore?
[43:37.51]That's what happened to me.
[43:39.01]I just said unscrupulous too many times to the point where it didn't sound like it was actually a word.
[43:43.29]This is new.
[43:55.49]Means whatever you want.
[43:56.53]Having or showing no moral principles.
[44:00.17]So how did I use it?
[44:01.19]I said that there were some unscrupulous things, right?
[44:04.87]So Namco Bando has no moral principles.
[44:08.20]They're not honest and they're not fair.
[44:10.24]Yeah, I got it.
[44:11.32]I got it right.
[44:15.72]I need two points in strength.
[44:16.80]How much is this going to give me?
[44:21.49]Enough to get a level, I think.
[44:22.69]Let's see.
[44:23.75]I think so.
[44:34.73]I knew I was supposed to go over here.
[44:37.56]It's getting too hard in the other way.
[44:41.44]You used it right a little vague in the original sentence.
[44:44.66]At least I did it right.
[44:45.38]I say a lot of words that actually don't mean anything.
[44:53.71]Oh, damn it.
[44:54.37]I need 50 to 100.
[44:56.75]I don't have any more of those.
[45:02.01]Let's go kill a couple bugs.
[45:03.55]I'll be right back.
[45:09.22]It's your birthday today.
[45:13.15]Where was it?
[45:14.81]There it is.
[45:19.97]I can't believe somebody actually made that website.
[45:23.23]Somebody is paying a hosting fee to have that website up for the last, like, two years.
[45:32.06]I commend you.
[45:33.92]You're being commended.
[45:38.85]Check the perimeter.
[45:43.28]Secret doors.
[45:45.52]Oh, it's a poison swamp.
[45:49.80]Not only is there a swamp in Dark Souls 3, but there's also a poison swamp.
[45:56.10]Just in case you didn't like the swamp behind you, the poison swamp might make you feel a little better.
[46:01.98]Well, in that case... Poison.
[46:07.10]Poison.
[46:09.38]Looks like we're going to be the witch.
[46:16.42]30, 59, 61.
[46:16.54]Might be going back to grandma here.
[46:21.55]Going back to witch grandmother.
[46:22.81]Alright.
[46:37.13]Poison resist.
[46:37.75]Do I have any of those moss things?
[46:39.47]I think I just got one.
[46:48.22]Well, let's go.
[46:58.37]Iron flesh.
[47:07.49]I have no idea where I'm going.
[47:12.23]I'm going to hold on to these ones though.
[47:13.55]I don't think it's doing that much damage to me.
[47:23.92]These guys do petrify.
[47:25.08]That's what it is, right?
[47:27.49]The bullfrog bug aliens do petrify, if I remember.
[47:30.51]They stand in their petrify goo.
[47:38.05]Don't fucking do it!
[47:40.51]They're fogging this place up.
[48:03.07]It might be a good idea to be at 100% health.
[48:05.87]Doesn't Petrify do like all of your health?
[48:08.77]Or like 80% of it or something?
[48:18.40]The area of effect of this shit is fucking huge.
[48:25.10]I can't even go near you guys.
[48:26.28]You guys are like fishbowling this whole map.
[48:37.94]As they say.
[48:44.28]Still alive.
[48:44.78]Okay, okay.
[48:51.53]Okay, we get it, dude.
[48:52.75]You vape.
[48:53.85]We get it.
[48:58.01]Guys, see, I made a vape joke.
[49:00.88]See, like, we get it.
[49:01.82]You vape.
[49:09.55]Was the AOE always that big?
[49:10.84]I feel like it wasn't entirely.
[49:12.50]I don't know.
[49:12.88]It seems like it's a legit fog machine.
[49:20.48]Please have there not be a poison boss.
[49:22.10]Please have there not be a poison boss.
[49:27.80]Poison areas are usually the worst areas.
[49:33.62]What a topical meme that was.
[49:43.79]I see the North Star in the distance.
[49:45.31]That means we're going the right way.
[49:46.35]Look, the North Star!
[49:54.42]I wish I could run in this.
[49:55.98]I can't even move faster.
[49:56.98]I'd have to roll.
[50:01.05]Large soul of a nameless soldier.
[50:02.45]Cool.
[50:07.99]See, even holding down Sprint doesn't do anything.
[50:13.13]I could go up there.
[50:14.19]I want to try to get some of these items, though.
[50:18.73]Oh, Land Ho.
[50:19.93]Thank God.
[50:27.90]That's Sprint.
[50:41.82]Even fills up behind them too.
[50:49.68]Jerma does not sound happy playing this game.
[50:52.50]I'm like a disgruntled worker right now.
[50:59.96]I'm just being very intense right now because I don't want to die in the poison area.
[51:06.55]Time for death.
[51:08.39]What is that?
[51:15.96]What is that?
[51:18.83]That is so scary.
[51:22.51]I'm not gonna go over there.
[51:23.85]I'm not going over there.
[51:28.52]Are you kidding me?
[51:30.44]You want me to fight that guy with poison?
[51:32.16]That's just not gonna happen.
[51:44.02]It's the worst when there are a lot of these guys because they seriously fill up the whole area.
[52:04.55]Just in case.
[52:05.27]He's just over there watching intently.
[52:20.34]Do I have an item that makes the petrify go down?
[52:22.98]I should probably check.
[52:39.06]I should be able to get you.
[52:42.88]Get your dust out of here.
[52:49.16]Yikes.
[52:51.06]I just want to make sure, do I have one?
[52:52.63]I have a bleed one, I have a poison one.
[52:55.59]I've got this dwarf's booze.
[52:57.27]I haven't drank yet.
[53:00.31]No, I don't.
[53:08.32]Oh, shit.
[53:09.36]I thought that was poison when I came back for some reason.
[53:14.25]I saw the purple in purple, and I immediately said, oh, that's the poison one.
[53:17.35]That's the poison ticking away, isn't it?
[53:20.21]Whatever, I can buy them.
[53:20.89]It's not a big deal.
[53:29.49]Pear powder.
[53:36.71]An open chest.
[53:37.57]There's another chest.
[53:39.63]Hold on a second.
[53:41.15]This seems a little fishy.
[53:45.94]Golden scroll.
[53:50.98]Antiquated.
[53:51.56]Let's take a look.
[53:58.44]Antiquated dress.
[54:00.60]Huge curse resistance.
[54:02.10]I'm going to assume the other ones are like that too.
[54:05.06]Yeah, they are.
[54:05.78]Yep.
[54:10.86]Anti-curse.
[54:14.02]Sounds fantastic.
[54:18.15]I guess we're going to go straight across.
[54:27.61]Finally safe from the poison for the time being.
[54:30.17]I'm going to go up and around, but I don't think I can.
[54:45.56]Giant egg sacs that are hanging from the
[54:50.67]That doesn't that look like could be an illusory wall I'm telling you it's got to be one here look at this look at all perfectly flat.
[54:57.70]This is Come on look at how perfect that is it looks just perfect flat walls Look how perfect this wall is it's a perfect fake wall
[55:22.35]Careful now.
[55:23.09]I'm scared.
[55:30.98]I am scared.
[55:38.20]Getting lost in poison world.
[55:39.74]I don't like this.
[55:43.34]Everything's too scary.
[55:45.29]Give me a bonfire.
[55:49.94]Oh, they're slugs.
[55:51.54]They're actually slugs.
[55:53.70]Wow.
[55:55.50]Oh, my God.
[55:56.14]Look at them.
[55:57.18]Look at them.
[55:57.50]This is a real slug we're looking at.
[56:00.14]That's not a fake slug.
[56:01.26]Oh, do you like pukes, too?
[56:03.62]They have, like, brown puke.
[56:06.82]Wow.
[56:07.20]I'm going to get a better look at this guy.
[56:08.41]Hold on.
[56:10.19]Look at how majestic that is.
[56:13.46]He can move around, he's gonna get up, he can spit, he just tried, look, he's eating something, he's eating the algae!
[56:18.67]Aw, cool, he ate the algae!
[56:23.27]Fuck out of my... They're protecting the hive.
[56:43.63]I missed, really.
[56:53.30]I need to find a bathroom.
[57:00.74]Bonfire.
[57:01.26]I need to find a bonfire.
[57:15.40]Watch this.
[57:19.76]Whoa!
[57:21.23]Bone shard.
[57:22.09]Isn't that a thing for the Estus Flask?
[57:23.57]I thought that was moving.
[57:27.23]It is moving.
[57:27.63]What is going on?
[57:29.15]What is that?
[57:29.51]Did you see that?
[57:33.16]Some dude was just teleporting around.
[57:46.09]Okay.
[57:49.15]Don't pee into the mic.
[57:51.59]I don't pee into the mic.
[57:55.57]Crab, I think, over there.
[57:59.28]Lots of items where the big enemy crab is.
[58:07.10]Bonfire?
[58:07.62]Bonfire?
[58:08.10]Come on.
[58:08.94]Yeah.
[58:10.08]I knew you were going to give me a bonfire right here.
[58:11.76]I just knew it.
[58:17.46]Now I'm going to level up.
[58:24.00]Oh shit, what the hell is the name of this place?
[58:25.52]I don't even know what this place is named.
[58:36.47]Okay, I got some new stuff to give.
[58:40.47]Shrine Handmaiden will prepare new items.
[58:42.37]This is to get new items.
[58:44.49]Sorceries, I don't need this.
[58:46.25]Makes soul... Who does this go to?
[58:50.13]Give to Ludlith, Lord of Cinder, to conduct soul transposition.
[58:56.80]This kiln can transpose twisted souls to craft special items with their concentrated essence.
[59:03.10]Hold on.
[59:04.10]Gift to conduct soul...
[59:07.17]Special items?
[59:11.17]Well, we have some things to give to people, so may as well.
[59:14.08]I know this is yours.
[59:16.44]Take this.
[59:18.60]Let's see what new stuff she has.
[59:24.22]Oh, you can now buy these.
[59:28.39]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[59:35.07]dried finger should only be used with the greatest of caution.
[59:41.37]I don't think I want to use that.
[59:52.20]Boost damage absorption when HP is full.
[59:57.50]Huh.
[60:01.14]I can buy these.
[60:01.86]I can buy the big ones.
[60:05.73]Still can only buy charcoal and human, though, from this lady.
[60:08.49]I should buy this, but I'm going to be really unscrupulous, and I'm not going to buy it.
[60:31.41]Unscrupulous.
[60:38.67]Wait.
[60:41.11]I'm going to actually explore Firelink.
[60:43.21]Because I feel like there's people that keep teleporting around.
[60:46.48]I really only know of these three people.
[60:49.42]I need... I need 45,000 souls.
[60:51.32]Okay.
[60:51.50]Okay.
[61:08.72]What's over here?
[61:20.94]Any hidden walls?
[61:28.22]This place is so big, it would be surprising if there was nobody else here.
[61:31.32]Wasn't he?
[61:41.09]One of my thoughts on Dark Souls 3 is an iPad gamer.
[61:53.54]Well, it's good.
[61:57.98]I'm having a blast.
[62:00.50]See, look, this is a fucking boss room.
[62:05.23]This is a gosh darn boss room.
[62:07.63]I think it's a good game.
[62:09.05]I do.
[62:12.48]It definitely feels more fluid and feels a little bit more fun than the previous Dark Souls games in regards to combat.
[62:25.47]What's that?
[62:29.48]I want to sit on the throne.
[62:30.40]Is that blood or fire?
[62:35.24]I can't tell.
[62:42.03]What is that?
[62:43.67]Whoa.
[62:44.57]There's a guy right here.
[62:47.69]See, I knew there were people in here.
[62:49.78]Okay.
[62:51.78]Okay.
[62:54.14]That's PvP stuff, right?
[62:54.74]Using the cracked orbs for...
[63:12.63]Can I take something from the Iron Throne?
[63:15.29]I wanna play like the Game of Thrones video game.
[63:19.89]Where's the mother of dragons?
[63:21.80]Where is she?
[63:23.34]Starcraft Zerg rush.
[63:40.81]Somebody's sitting in that throne.
[63:42.83]Is that just a skeleton?
[63:46.48]Uh, thanks a lot, Starcraft.
[63:48.64]Please don't Zerg rush me.
[63:50.36]Can I even get over to him?
[63:53.38]This isn't NPC.
[63:55.44]This guy just blends in with the whole... How are you ever supposed to see this guy?
[63:59.35]I am bloodless of Corland.
[64:03.36]The only thing that's different on this guy in the chair is he has a little bit of gold on him.
[64:10.26]Wait, what is that?
[64:12.79]Oh, fuck.
[64:40.20]Oh, okay.
[64:41.16]Hold on.
[64:43.44]Hold on.
[64:43.84]Hold on.
[64:49.60]Hold on.
[64:52.18]Hold on.
[64:53.99]Oh, damn it.
[64:56.05]I'm gonna have to jump all the way around.
[65:05.49]How did I miss two people in this room?
[65:08.10]Because I don't know I wasn't looking to see if there was a half guy like sitting in the chair the same color as the chair Like it is a Transposing seen better days, but now Bring to me Transposition is the art of extracting and coal in transposing a twisted soul It's true thy purpose is to seek Lord's power
[65:39.94]Oh, this is the boss soul guy.
[65:41.64]Okay.
[65:42.87]Makes sense.
[65:43.35]So what does he have?
[65:46.11]I can actually take a look at these weapons and see if they're any good.
[65:51.55]Hollow Slayer Greatsword.
[65:55.38]Cool.
[65:56.74]It's from the Crystal Sage.
[65:57.88]E and E. It scales with magic.
[66:03.60]Demon's Greataxe.
[66:06.85]Vort's Greathammer.
[66:12.61]This is kind of cool.
[66:17.43]Oh, I wish I knew about that.
[66:18.85]Alright, whatever.
[66:24.13]Bye-bye.
[66:30.49]Anyone else?
[66:36.88]I don't think so.
[66:50.50]Alright, back to work.
[66:53.92]Unless I didn't go this way, maybe?
[66:56.40]Oh, there's the guy that's supposed to be my best friend.
[67:04.38]You're hiding in like the catacombs.
[67:05.80]What is it?
[67:07.92]I was looking for you this whole game.
[67:12.93]This pilgrim.
[67:15.23]With a debt in death, hardly deserves to behold this divine flame.
[67:21.80]And I never would have, had you not taken me into your service.
[67:26.28]Nice.
[67:27.60]I thank you dearly.
[67:30.38]Draw out true strength?
[67:31.80]I don't know if I want to press that button.
[67:36.68]Listen to me, son!
[67:39.12]I'm your dad!
[67:46.21]Otto.
[67:47.09]Otto985.
[67:47.97]I can't destroy this guy.
[67:51.49]I can't.
[67:52.03]He's too friendly.
[67:53.43]But thanks, Otto.
[67:56.43]Welcome.
[67:56.73]Thanks a lot.
[67:57.11]Appreciate it, dude.
[67:59.35]Welcome, my dog and my numbers.
[68:03.89]So he sells sorcery stuff.
[68:08.17]Cool.
[68:09.95]I guess that's really good to know, considering if you're going to do an actual magic sorcery soul arrow build, you can get it early, right?
[68:19.38]Because this guy is pretty early.
[68:21.32]He's in the first 40 minutes of the game.
[68:27.74]If I press this, is he going to turn into a werewolf and start attacking me?
[68:32.23]I mean, might as well.
[68:33.33]I'm not going to use this guy for any reason.
[68:35.14]So, let's... Hey, let me... Show me your true form.
[68:38.14]I don't know if I should have done this.
[68:42.68]Should I have done this?
[68:44.42]Huh?
[68:44.52]What is going on?
[69:00.73]I can level up with him?
[69:12.11]So you just get to level up with him one time.
[69:17.09]Okay.
[69:19.21]Thanks for the free skill point.
[69:21.47]I guess.
[69:25.31]Thanks for showing me my true power.
[69:31.25]That was awful.
[69:33.71]You could have at least given me two or three of those.
[69:37.08]When I hear true strength, I don't think of one point in strength.
[69:44.73]Actually, well, thanks.
[69:46.55]We can all thank this guy because now I can put on the Astora Greatsword.
[70:01.43]Now, let's see here.
[70:10.32]This might be a little too slow for my taste.
[70:16.54]I think it might be just a tad slow.
[70:18.66]It's slower than the scythe.
[70:27.76]I'm gonna have to say a nay.
[70:29.58]Negative.
[70:35.12]I almost just came up and smashed this dude.
[70:37.50]Just out of curiosity, I want to see what would happen.
[70:40.63]134 plus 44.
[70:43.37]Decided right now.
[70:44.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:46.05]Still better.
[71:02.60]We keep staying with the scythe.
[71:03.82]We have to be scythe boys for a little longer.
[71:12.21]Well... I didn't want to always be a scythe boy, but... I kinda can't go back on it now.
[71:28.43]Alright.
[71:29.02]Sorry for the boring, like, last ten straight minutes.
[71:34.43]Big heavy melee weapons are the best.
[71:37.58]I usually do that though.
[71:41.40]And I want to just try to be something different.
[71:43.22]I want to do something different.
[71:45.00]I've done big heavy 500 damage a swing giant swing sword guy in every one of these games.
[71:52.94]I'd rather be something else.
[71:55.80]I'm going to go this way first.
[71:58.42]No.
[72:00.12]Let's check it.
[72:03.18]You guys are creepy.
[72:06.62]That's definitely poison.
[72:12.58]What's the range?
[72:13.34]If I stay... Yeah, I'm still looking.
[72:14.55]I don't know if it was just a... Ooh.
[72:24.89]Ooh.
[72:25.73]And a guy with a shield.
[72:27.13]Ooh!
[72:29.93]You two lovelies.
[72:34.27]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[72:37.66]Welcome back, White Fang.
[72:41.74]Thanks for the continued subscription.
[72:46.58]For only $5 a month, you can watch some asshole get his ass kicked in Dark Souls 3.
[72:57.77]He actually got it off.
[72:58.33]He's still healing.
[72:58.85]He's healing to full life.
[73:02.51]Alright.
[73:03.59]Did not... You know what?
[73:06.33]Reset.
[73:08.47]Reset.
[73:11.53]Knowing that that can happen, I gotta kill this guy fast.
[73:17.46]Or just pull this dude and attack him only.
[73:19.86]Yeah, I'll reset.
[73:27.55]I'm gonna do this again.
[73:40.10]You know what, we're gonna uh... We're just gonna go ahead and do a little bit of a reset.
[73:44.65]Fuck.
[73:48.87]These guys are nuts!
[73:54.01]This is a hard pull.
[74:07.77]I missed?
[74:10.29]How did I miss the first one?
[74:19.29]If you just walk another couple feet forward, I won't have to aggro you to your friends.
[74:26.84]Actually, that's not a bad spot for you to be in.
[74:31.02]Right there, stay right there.
[74:33.90]Stay right there.
[74:49.94]Hmm, you're big and you're stupid.
[74:58.59]Ring around the Rosie.
[74:59.59]Ring around the Rosie.
[75:00.57]I didn't get him.
[75:02.33]Oh.
[75:08.47]Oh, my Jesus.
[75:10.35]Wow.
[75:27.70]I don't want to fight you on this bridge, so please follow me.
[75:33.04]Just follow your nose!
[75:51.85]Poison gem, that's kind of cool.
[75:58.03]Now that... was... interesting.
[76:04.43]Mmm, interesting.
[76:05.13]This guy doesn't... they don't get staggered for very long when you hit them.
[76:15.74]Or... knockbacked.
[76:28.04]It's back to the bonfire.
[76:29.18]That looks like another direction to go through.
[76:31.42]This looks like I can maybe get an item over here.
[76:39.31]Maybe.
[76:46.82]What's back here?
[76:47.50]You wouldn't have this for no reason, would you?
[77:01.19]Pretty pointless.
[77:08.53]I thought I was stuck there forever for a second.
[77:11.01]That would have been disheartening.
[77:18.96]Shit.
[77:20.78]Thought this could have been like a little shortcutty thing maybe.
[77:35.64]Alright.
[77:37.36]I did my due diligence.
[77:38.28]I feel like I just went in a circle.
[78:10.71]What?!
[78:15.27]He just Goomba stomped me and insta-killed me!
[78:17.69]I don't think you could get Goomba'd in this game.
[78:36.01]Oh, this is not cool.
[78:36.93]I gotta go past the bridge of these three idiots again?
[78:41.17]Let's see if I can get by them.
[78:44.95]We don't want to fight them again.
[78:53.17]How aggressive are you?
[78:54.19]Let's find out.
[78:54.73]Are you still behind me?
[79:00.13]Yes, you are.
[79:02.01]Oh, goodness.
[79:02.87]They're all still behind me.
[79:09.66]Here comes the Goomba guy.
[79:16.73]See ya.
[79:18.21]Please leave me be.
[79:26.78]Two of these guys.
[79:28.22]Whatever that is, that's gonna be... There's three of these guys guarding this item.
[79:32.98]Be a thief.
[79:34.30]Be a good thief.
[79:38.76]I got him.
[79:39.04]I think you killed me.
[79:45.73]Okay, at what point in that whole thing did I die?
[79:49.85]Where in that whole thing?
[79:51.19]I didn't die right away.
[79:52.56]I got squashed so many times, I would just be a pool of blood.
[79:59.34]There would be no flesh or body parts.
[80:21.24]Okay, it's only these two.
[80:22.28]Except that guy can swing very far.
[80:27.59]Oh, boy.
[80:35.81]Dangerous.
[80:37.33]Dangerous people.
[80:39.87]Too dangerous.
[80:45.84]Oh, oh.
[80:50.82]He's still behind me.
[80:52.90]No, no, get away.
[80:56.98]I just want to get the item that I saw over here.
[80:58.65]I saw one.
[81:03.29]Where did I see it?
[81:04.15]Did I go by it?
[81:05.29]Is this the slug room?
[81:11.97]Alright, get away from me.
[81:16.81]I'm sick of your shit.
[81:18.31]Sage's coal, what is that?
[81:28.00]Sage's Coal.
[81:28.66]Enable crystal blessed in deep infusion.
[81:32.76]It's an upgrade to the infusion machine.
[81:36.92]Okay.
[81:38.55]Sounds fun.
[81:45.19]Oh.
[81:45.33]Okay, that's a bad guy.
[82:00.41]I don't want to fight that guy right now.
[82:01.51]Are you serious?
[82:07.00]Everyone's going to call me a baby if I don't fight him.
[82:10.00]Fine.
[82:35.58]I didn't even have to parry him, I just had to dodge over Does everybody have to two-hit kill you in this game?
[83:00.24]Oh, this way.
[83:15.22]I just don't know where it is.
[83:23.56]Unscribble the puzzle.
[83:25.42]Good get.
[83:28.80]Ah shit, what's that puzzle?
[83:29.94]I don't think I can do it.
[83:38.48]Don't jump!
[83:41.02]Don't jump!
[83:42.72]Okay, I'm like freaking out right now.
[83:49.08]Please get off of me.
[83:50.60]I would love if a Titanite shard could get off of my screen.
[83:53.58]Did he just do it again?
[84:03.19]Okay, yeah, no, you're gonna do that again, obviously.
[84:07.95]Jesus.
[84:08.95]Now he's on all fours.
[84:20.91]Where is this guy again?
[84:21.69]Right over here.
[84:32.92]Great sword.
[84:41.47]Big and heavy and clunky.
[84:42.87]I don't think I want it.
[84:48.85]Yeah, that's a pretty good Mortal Kombat move that guy was doing.
[84:53.15]So, I'm officially lost.
[84:58.31]I don't know where the hell I'm supposed to be going.
[85:00.65]The guy with the sword with the skull face is where I want to go, but I have no idea where he is.
[85:04.48]That's 3 damage.
[85:07.00]Did I actually not get him?
[85:09.50]Oh, his friend is here.
[85:16.89]Come on, you're gonna wedge me in here right now?
[85:20.65]What the fuck?
[85:22.81]This tiny little lip.
[85:24.71]This tiny little lip connected- Did I tell you about the trees?
[85:28.71]I wish I could just fucking phase through the trees.
[85:30.45]Can you just remove trees from the game?
[85:33.11]They don't have a purpose.
[85:34.01]Just get the trees out of here!
[85:35.21]I'm just getting like stuck on a little lip in the corner.
[85:39.23]Just- Next patch, trees have been removed from the game.
[86:07.37]It wouldn't be bad if these enemies weren't so, so erratic.
[86:13.15]I thought I could get him with a big stab.
[86:21.57]Oh my god.
[86:35.05]Please.
[86:36.97]I asked you nicely.
[86:37.97]Please don't do it.
[86:48.87]He just tried to fake me out so bad.
[86:52.05]He did like the top model runway walk.
[86:55.99]Into the I just ran at you.
[86:57.35]He did the top model runway walk.
[87:05.78]I think I might just say, fuck this place, just go over here.
[87:07.84]Because it is a Dark Souls swamp place.
[87:17.99]You usually want to go through this as fast as possible and never come back again.
[87:32.00]Mm-hmm.
[87:32.24]Mm-hmm.
[87:48.36]Or the Schwamp.
[87:55.71]Okay.
[88:00.07]Thank you for making that easy for me.
[88:04.99]Huh?
[88:08.73]Put out the flames?
[88:09.69]Do I have a water spell?
[88:12.42]Well, this has to be one of the three flames, right?
[88:14.36]Alright, I'm gonna blow it out.
[88:25.55]God, another area that's the same as the last one.
[88:29.53]I'm so lost.
[88:33.95]At least it's slugs.
[88:37.07]This part is just slugs.
[88:40.57]I feel so relieved.
[88:45.06]I can just relax.
[88:46.18]The slugs are cool.
[88:46.96]I don't have to worry about them.
[88:51.08]See, all they do is just get up and spit.
[88:53.86]What a relief.
[89:00.71]Look at how many are over here.
[89:01.59]There's a whole congregation over here.
[89:04.31]Nice.
[89:05.63]Nice!
[89:06.11]Alright, no more fucking around.
[89:09.90]It's time to kill the whole slug family!
[89:18.41]Okay, hold on.
[89:19.31]Don't get cocky.
[89:33.19]I feel bad about what I just did.
[89:34.33]Anything up here?
[89:43.37]No, I remember this.
[89:49.76]Ah, I can't take this.
[89:55.98]Yeah, me either, buddy.
[89:58.44]I feel your pain.
[90:01.96]That's the thing.
[90:02.62]Dark Souls is a community.
[90:06.30]We all just... Everyone that plays this game all knows that we all are, like, suffering.
[90:11.56]It's a community of sufferers.
[90:14.90]And we applaud each other.
[90:19.43]Because we're all going through the same shit. ...
[90:32.13]Stone Parma.
[90:38.47]I don't want to miss any of these items.
[90:40.38]I just got an Estus Blast Shard.
[90:45.00]I don't want to just run.
[90:46.26]Oh, no.
[90:47.36]Oh, no.
[90:47.72]Alright, hold on.
[90:52.28]I found my way back to this guy.
[90:55.78]I can't believe that was Harry.
[90:57.06]I can't believe it!
[91:06.28]Not now, Orson.
[91:07.32]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[91:11.93]Corn on the rob.
[91:13.60]Thanks for the resale.
[91:44.03]Not this time Joker.
[91:48.23]Hey, not this time Joker.
[91:56.41]You won't get away with it this time Joker!
[92:14.36]It's never not time for Orson.
[92:17.39]That's true.
[92:34.13]What a shit item he dropped.
[92:36.99]That just hit me.
[92:39.27]That guy was a tough, hard, like, mini-boss guy.
[92:43.30]And he dropped a pile of crap.
[92:47.56]Oh, I'm gonna bone it up here.
[92:50.62]I'm poisoned.
[92:51.22]I don't have any healing or anything.
[92:54.74]Yeah, it's time to bone it up.
[92:58.25]I can level up again.
[93:01.23]Bone it up.
[93:21.40]I get a very big Game of Thrones vibe from this song in the shrine.
[93:45.36]Can you just picture like Eddard Stark discussing something with his son?
[93:53.41]You're not gonna do it.
[93:55.41]What a terrible Eddard stuff.
[93:56.95]That was so bad.
[94:01.45]I am so embarrassed right now.
[94:03.07]That was fucking terrible.
[94:05.17]You're not gonna do it?
[94:07.04]You're not gonna do it.
[94:08.20]Good Eddard.
[94:11.32]That was fucking terrible.
[94:17.28]Not gonna do it.
[94:28.13]Ah, just one name.
[94:30.47]Coal.
[94:30.99]Here, you can have this.
[94:33.29]Well, well.
[94:35.19]What's the undead legion doing with a coal such as this?
[94:38.94]I don't know.
[94:40.50]I'd heard one of the crystal sages had sided with Farron's Abyss Watchers.
[94:46.00]I suppose it must be true.
[94:48.52]You should know.
[94:51.04]This coal is imbued with magic.
[94:54.94]First one I've ever seen.
[95:04.48]That's my favorite quote from Eddard.
[95:06.98]You're not gonna do it.
[95:09.42]Really stuck with me.
[95:22.72]My mood has been elevated.
[95:25.55]You're not gonna do it.
[95:28.66]Oh, what a fucking jackass.
[95:37.75]They film Game of Thrones in your town, Mackerel?
[95:42.29]That's kind of amazing.
[95:47.03]Do you like bump into actors?
[95:50.33]Do you go to the coffee shop just so you can accidentally, in quotes, bump into one of the actors?
[95:56.45]You know that, like, Peter Dinklage is going to be at the Starbucks.
[95:59.01]You know they always go there.
[95:59.87]So you go there with your laptop.
[96:00.81]You hang out for a little bit.
[96:01.93]You see the limo pull up.
[96:02.91]You see Peter Dinklage get out.
[96:04.35]You get up.
[96:04.77]You're going to get in line.
[96:05.35]You're going to get a coffee, maybe.
[96:06.31]I feel like another coffee.
[96:07.45]You get in line.
[96:07.99]He comes up behind you.
[96:09.19]You get your coffee.
[96:10.29]You turn around.
[96:10.77]Give him a little bump.
[96:11.37]Oh, sorry.
[96:11.69]I didn't see you there.
[96:12.55]Peter Dinklage.
[96:13.57]And he's like, yeah, I'm Peter Dinklage.
[96:15.15]And you're like, wow, that's cool.
[96:16.53]Peter Dinklage.
[96:16.99]Game of Thrones, right?
[96:18.13]Yes, that's right.
[96:18.71]Game of Thrones.
[96:19.23]Ah, cool, man.
[96:20.09]What are you doing later?
[96:20.97]Yeah, that's what I'd do.
[96:24.97]He'd be like, oh, nothing.
[96:26.47]Thanks for asking.
[96:27.03]Would you like to come over?
[96:27.89]Yeah, dude.
[96:29.50]I'm getting kind of busy, but I don't see if I can schedule it in something like that.
[96:34.16]You know what I mean?
[96:34.62]Alright.
[96:34.96]That would work.
[96:51.29]Where the fuck am I going?
[96:52.89]Let's be real.
[96:54.86]Where am I supposed to go?
[96:55.63]I don't think they let them out too much so people don't harass them, but they sneak out sometimes.
[97:07.31]I seriously can't get over how embarrassing that Sean Bean impression was and how bad of a line.
[97:14.86]I'm never going to be able to live that down.
[97:16.34]That was so bad.
[97:17.24]See, this is live TV, guys.
[97:19.96]You get to see how stupid I actually am.
[97:26.24]Get out of here.
[97:28.34]Get out!
[97:29.80]Get out!
[97:32.24]Get out!
[97:34.03]Get out!
[97:36.51]Get out!
[97:39.53]Oh no.
[97:40.79]Where have I gone?
[97:46.42]I see another item.
[97:54.81]If you bumped into him, he'd be the face full of your crotch.
[97:57.79]No, no, I'd, like, just trip a little.
[98:01.81]And I would just barely, you know, like, oh, excuse me, excuse me, sorry.
[98:05.59]Wait a second.
[98:06.99]Peter!
[98:09.73]And he'd be like, yeah, hey, hey.
[98:12.40]He'd go, oh, hey, whoa!
[98:14.46]Like, he'd be like, oh, I recognize you.
[98:15.86]Can this be where I'm supposed to go?
[98:23.20]I'd like that a lot.
[98:29.64]Please?
[98:31.68]No, where?
[98:41.97]I'd like to use the bonfire.
[98:43.69]If you could let me use it, please.
[98:44.69]Just get out of the way.
[98:49.13]You can not.
[98:50.09]Look.
[98:51.23]I don't know you.
[98:54.33]Don't ever bump into me at Starbucks again.
[99:01.52]Yeah, he'd be like, whoa, hold on, is it Jerma?
[99:05.20]Jerma985?
[99:05.84]Whoa, whoa, I've seen your work.
[99:11.17]And I'd be like, oh, wow, yeah, cool, dude.
[99:16.21]And then he would look at me dead in the eyes and be like, I'm actually a big fan of fucking morons acting like idiots and sucking at everything.
[99:23.91]And then I would be like... What?
[99:30.41]I don't know what... And my face would start to... You know when your face starts to get a little red?
[99:35.36]You can tell.
[99:36.08]Your face is like slowly... You can feel the blood kind of going into your face.
[99:41.62]And I fucking... My brain... He knows.
[99:43.79]He knows that I'm turning red.
[99:45.47]And then you get even more red.
[99:47.55]And then you kind of do something to make it look like it was supposed to be red in the first place.
[99:52.43]Like, it's like hot in here.
[99:54.33]Starbucks keep their temperature at like 80 or something.
[99:56.88]Jesus, it's fucking hot.
[99:57.46]I don't know what you're talking about though, Peter.
[99:58.88]That's funny that you say that.
[100:05.88]Then he spits directly into my face.
[100:10.43]And there's no debating that that's what he meant to do.
[100:18.31]Okay.
[100:19.07]Let's get some high ground.
[100:21.41]That's where I died.
[100:26.19]Confirmed from Blusher.
[100:33.06]No, not again!
[100:33.66]Not again, not again.
[100:34.58]You saw what just happened.
[100:35.24]I almost did it again.
[100:35.80]I almost did what just happened again.
[100:38.54]It even had the indicator of where I was.
[100:42.69]I just got a flashback.
[100:48.27]Well, you have to have this many people and have to be this slow in the swamp.
[101:08.85]Come here!
[101:11.95]What did they do?
[101:17.04]It's trying to show me a trick they keep coming up and telling me okay watch it hey mom watch this one And they do like a big dive I'm so glad that I'm fine after that Good tricks guys, that's all they wanted Didn't want to fight this one to show me they're like skateboarding trick I
[101:59.75]Okay, well your trick sucked.
[102:04.07]He's still alive.
[102:12.18]I sincerely have no idea where I'm going.
[102:15.08]I'm just gonna have to go up.
[102:22.80]Dark Souls AI doesn't make any sense to me.
[102:26.28]It really doesn't.
[102:27.58]Sometimes, I swear to God there's a fucking dice in this game, in the engine.
[102:32.23]There is a 12-sided die.
[102:34.71]There's two of them, okay?
[102:36.95]One of the sided die is like a scale of 1 to 12 as to how stupid the enemy is going to be.
[102:43.72]We're talking like walk around in circles, not attack, or just how dumb the enemy is.
[102:51.33]The other dice that gets rolled is how often the enemy attacks.
[102:56.72]So it's like sometimes you get an enemy that just literally is walking in a circle and swings once.
[103:02.28]Sometimes you get a guy that sprints everywhere and doesn't attack one time at all.
[103:06.42]Sometimes you get a guy that just fucking swings around in a circle a thousand times and doesn't move.
[103:11.36]I want to see the data on this.
[103:17.30]I want to see the data.
[103:24.97]I just want to get behind you.
[103:26.32]Where?
[103:26.70]Another one.
[103:27.28]Another one.
[103:28.30]Another one.
[103:30.18]Another one.
[103:31.26]Okay.
[103:33.04]Sure.
[103:34.22]And I was already here.
[103:35.32]Another one.
[103:41.67]I think I'm going to go this way.
[103:44.37]I'm just looking for a door to go in.
[103:46.37]It's going to be interesting to see that data.
[103:50.52]I want to see the data.
[103:58.69]I'm going to just hug the walls.
[104:04.05]Hugging the walls is the best strategy here.
[104:07.43]Watch out, the muppet is still following me.
[104:11.81]The rejected muppet is still following me.
[104:15.31]Good.
[104:15.51]I'm glad.
[104:18.07]See?
[104:18.61]Where's the dice?
[104:19.35]Did you see the dice that just got rolled?
[104:22.95]That was the moron dice that rolled.
[104:41.86]Don't spit don't spit.
[104:43.10]It's not very nice of you Ragged mask Not really that great Wouldn't be Dark Souls without another poison swamp
[105:04.99]Yeah, I mean... Ooh, I've been here before.
[105:09.65]I wonder how the meetings, like the production meetings go.
[105:14.74]For the FromSoftware team.
[105:18.50]You know what I mean?
[105:21.10]They map out all these areas, they come up with all the areas, and they go, hold on a second, guys.
[105:25.35]Uh...
[105:26.50]There's no way what's the place guys all they are what's the place that everybody has?
[105:31.78]Unanimously said is the dumbest worst areas in the whole game every game Boss there will be others the shitty poison swap areas Jason exactly except your name's probably not Jason because we're in Japan, so it's something else, but exactly so that's a good point put that in the game again and
[105:51.28]And then make it a little bigger.
[105:53.14]But make sure it's the same color.
[105:54.92]Put a bunch of trees and shit.
[105:56.02]Put a bunch of trees everywhere.
[105:57.04]Make sure they can fall into the trees and get wedged in.
[105:59.56]Jason.
[106:09.74]I'm just gonna run this straight line.
[106:11.12]From here to there.
[106:13.13]No, I'm hugging the walls.
[106:16.41]Jason.
[106:17.47]Jason.
[106:36.39]I'm going to stay on the edge.
[106:38.85]I don't want to fight anybody.
[106:39.93]I'm just going to see the sights.
[107:02.04]Why can't they replace poison swamp number four?
[107:07.04]I'm not getting out of here alive.
[107:34.17]No, I'm getting wedged.
[107:35.28]Hold on.
[107:35.62]Hold on a second, guys.
[107:36.06]I'm getting wedged with the tree over here.
[107:39.26]Jason, you did a good job.
[107:40.22]Let's get a round of applause.
[107:45.89]Give a round of applause here for Jason.
[108:23.64]This is the... That looks like a place I could go.
[108:30.97]But I'm going to just go the way... Because this is like the bridge.
[108:40.59]Can't you do... Can't you bring us into the sky?
[108:43.88]Can't we climb a huge ladder?
[108:47.22]And just... Be in the clouds or something?
[108:51.37]You see, Super Mario did that really good.
[108:54.87]They made a level where you get to go on Rainbow Road in the sky.
[108:59.27]Where's the Rainbow Road from, software?
[109:02.87]Where's the red cap?
[109:18.20]Is he on me?
[109:31.73]Holy goodness gracious.
[109:36.87]We're just going in circles again.
[109:38.41]There's got to be a door.
[109:46.59]Come on, give me a door.
[109:47.55]Just give me a door.
[110:00.46]Throwing all fours.
[110:03.78]That is pointless.
[110:04.86]You know, usually I don't want to throw up from playing the game.
[110:20.84]But, getting close to throwing up.
[110:24.46]Throwing up!
[110:29.16]This is where Skeleton Man's back.
[110:31.40]I don't know why.
[110:35.18]Why is Skeleton Man back?
[110:37.63]He was a hard enemy.
[110:38.81]Usually they die and they go away forever.
[110:55.19]Is there anywhere I can even go here?
[110:59.20]Is there like one tiny little spot that I haven't seen yet?
[111:05.68]Because this is the first bonfire that I keep wrapping around of this bonfire.
[111:15.75]I think I might just leave this area.
[111:18.89]Because I keep getting here and there must be something I have to do.
[111:26.58]There's got to be something I have to do to move a rock or something.
[111:29.32]Because I'm going in a circle and there's nothing for me to do.
[111:31.68]Because now we're back over here.
[111:37.84]Hold on.
[111:54.03]Is that it?
[111:56.06]I think that's... because I remember being scared of this guy.
[111:59.64]Oh boy.
[112:07.65]Fucking tree.
[112:10.59]I think I gotta go up there.
[112:15.83]Boy.
[112:24.95]I'm telling you, they put these trees in the spots where they know people are going to have to back into them.
[112:34.28]Watch this one.
[112:35.06]People are going to have to back up when they fight this guy.
[112:36.80]He's going to bump into this tree behind him.
[112:38.41]Give me a high five.
[112:41.23]I'm going up top.
[112:45.41]We're FromSoftware.
[112:46.75]I don't know why you have to say your name of your company when you do that, but
[113:09.70]A light.
[113:10.14]I see a light.
[113:15.42]Oh, Jason.
[113:17.24]It's always Jason's idea.
[113:20.93]Who's shooting the skulls?
[113:24.39]Where are these skulls going, bro?
[113:25.75]This guy won't leave me alone.
[113:29.39]I'm gonna have to... Oh, watch out!
[113:30.72]Big tree, Jason!
[113:41.74]I want to get up and get those items.
[113:47.94]I can't see anything.
[113:52.36]Kill these things.
[113:53.28]No, I don't even want to.
[113:54.76]I wish I could run.
[113:55.94]I just wish I could run.
[113:57.74]How come I'm the only character that can't move fast through this?
[114:07.24]It's over.
[114:07.92]Bye.
[114:28.58]This area is trying my patience.
[114:34.52]I could go, like, to the crab area.
[114:36.14]I didn't go this way.
[114:37.54]I like this area better, because I can move.
[114:45.39]Oh, now I can't anymore.
[114:52.45]What am I even locked onto?
[115:09.02]We gotta give them a swamp and we have to make them walk.
[115:15.12]Most important thing.
[115:17.12]Hey, give me that.
[115:35.74]There's a whole load of people over there.
[115:37.22]I gotta be careful over here.
[115:42.38]There's like three guys over here.
[115:46.88]Is it even worth it?
[115:47.72]It might not be, but you know, sometimes you gotta do it.
[115:58.15]God, you guys are so brutal!
[116:05.77]Jesus Can you give me a second to it?
[116:09.73]Can you give me a second please?
[116:12.67]God!
[116:14.07]This guy rolled a 12 That guy rolled a 12 on the random enemies encounter device
[116:48.10]Who's this guy?
[116:49.30]One of those mushroom people.
[116:50.87]I remember these guys from Dark Souls 1.
[116:57.05]Don't throw the mushroom people at me now.
[116:59.20]I really don't want that at all.
[117:19.53]I'm gonna backstab you.
[117:24.69]I didn't get it, apparently.
[117:26.02]Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes.
[117:27.94]Alright, anything else over here?
[117:32.42]There's an item down there, but I'm not going back there.
[117:40.90]I'm never going back there.
[117:43.97]I won't go back.
[117:47.19]Oh, I remember these guys.
[118:08.22]Mushrooms.
[118:17.55]I thought he was going to jump in on that last swing.
[118:20.59]He really did.
[118:37.18]I don't think I've been up here.
[118:38.72]It seems as I see an item.
[118:47.67]Shit in a pot, too.
[118:51.45]Drink Estus soup?
[118:52.53]I don't want to just drink a random guy's soup.
[118:59.49]Okay.
[119:03.35]Praise the soup.
[119:04.65]There's actually a word in this game.
[119:06.11]Soup.
[119:08.57]Wolf's blood sword grass.
[119:10.07]I feel like that's an auto-corrected sentence.
[119:15.83]Okay, uh...
[119:22.60]There's an item over here.
[119:24.14]Just wedge through the trees.
[119:28.21]Thank you, Jason.
[119:34.03]Is there... Is the crab over here?
[119:35.07]Thank God for that random soup, yeah.
[119:45.92]Thank God.
[119:53.85]Get it!
[119:57.65]Armor.
[120:03.96]Well, I obviously have not been standing right here before, so... Whatever boss is in here, I really hope it's not an annoying run through this.
[120:12.80]Because you really can't run through this.
[120:19.49]Um...
[120:21.60]Oh, fuck.
[120:23.56]I'm one of the Skeksis.
[120:27.28]Please get away from me, Skeksi.
[120:42.65]I can run, thank God.
[120:47.89]I died over there.
[120:51.74]Like, do I... This is a giant door.
[120:54.28]Do I have to, like, light these on fire?
[121:00.46]How do I light these on fire?
[121:01.38]Do I have a torch?
[121:06.15]Where's the torch?
[121:12.31]I know I have one.
[121:17.39]Where's my torch to light these things?
[121:27.86]This is very conspicuous.
[121:32.26]I can't break them either.
[121:33.46]I have to light these three things on fire.
[121:37.56]I need to get a Deku stick.
[121:46.81]I see fire over there.
[121:47.77]This door has to open.
[121:56.13]I can't see a world where this does not open.
[122:00.42]By doing something stupid.
[122:25.26]I'm going to try something.
[122:27.32]I need to remember where this is.
[122:29.51]This is literally giant door with the three things I need to light on fire.
[122:37.99]So, giant door is right next to pillar in the middle with all the slugs, right?
[122:41.81]Alright, slug pillar.
[122:44.61]Take a right at the slug pillar.
[122:46.25]Giant door.
[122:48.89]So if we go back this way... Ladder!
[122:52.99]Ladder!
[122:54.68]Ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder.
[123:03.37]Get out of the way.
[123:04.47]Out of my way.
[123:05.75]This is gonna take me to Rainbow Road.
[123:30.95]Another bonfire?
[123:31.89]Where the hell am I?
[123:35.01]This is where I had to go.
[123:42.12]Whoa.
[123:53.23]Can I be a wolf guy?
[123:56.01]Yeah.
[124:06.72]No, you can't have that yet.
[124:09.92]Actually, you know, yeah, you can have it.
[124:11.40]Take it.
[124:12.42]Take it.
[124:12.64]I don't want it.
[124:14.82]Pray to the wolf god.
[124:15.86]Okay, bye.
[124:29.47]Thank you.
[124:29.83]It was fun meeting you.
[124:34.66]Now I'm going to go explore your cavern.
[124:36.92]Ooh.
[124:38.30]Dead guy.
[124:38.82]Is this some kind of skip or something?
[124:47.74]Well, remember that's there.
[124:51.49]Please tell me we're done with this area.
[124:52.79]Please say the boss is right here and I can just die like five times and the boss wouldn't beat him.
[124:56.93]And get out of here.
[125:10.13]It looks a little nicer.
[125:13.73]Okay.
[125:22.14]Okay, boss time, apparently.
[125:26.22]This is just the boss from Dark Souls 1.
[125:31.00]Is this the same exact boss?
[125:32.48]Is there a guy on the roof that's going to shoot me with an archer?
[125:35.28]Is there a chest up there or something?
[125:36.30]I don't know.
[125:39.65]Okay.
[125:41.85]I guess let's have a fight, Mr. Boss.
[125:51.98]Where's his boss meter?
[125:56.36]Okay.
[125:57.16]This is not a boss?
[125:58.04]It doesn't feel like it.
[126:05.12]Okay.
[126:21.44]You know so bad You know I missed oh That was a quick tail swipe No
[126:40.13]I just wasn't prepared for his quarter of a second tail swipe.
[126:44.94]Okay, well.
[126:54.07]Back to bed.
[127:14.33]Oh, I know what the problem is.
[127:15.58]Get this stupid shitty gear off of me.
[127:18.88]I don't need it anymore.
[127:23.41]Dying two hits from this guy.
[127:48.08]Shall we dance?
[127:49.60]Shall we dance?
[128:05.95]I want to move you backwards a little bit.
[128:21.15]Oh boy, he's spitting his poo at me.
[128:24.93]Oh man.
[128:34.06]Okay.
[128:41.52]Oh, I'm going to take one of these.
[128:43.72]So I don't get two-shot.
[128:46.41]It's really not any time to heal if he touches you.
[128:50.38]I mean, there is, but I don't know why I can't get a good opportunity.
[128:54.52]Getting comboed.
[128:57.09]He spit his poo into a fucking swing.
[129:17.90]Thought I was really gonna get him as Kylo Ren.
[129:20.92]Apparently not.
[129:21.62]I'm gonna send this back.
[129:22.70]I'm gonna wait for that again.
[129:34.20]They really play around with your brain.
[129:36.34]They fool with your emotions in this game.
[129:39.63]A bunch of enemies swing really slowly and are really deliberate, like this guy.
[129:45.23]All the enemies before him in this area were wild.
[129:52.18]They really play with your emotions.
[129:59.08]Okay.
[130:02.12]Not sure how you get away from that.
[130:04.69]Be underneath him?
[130:05.67]Be behind him?
[130:27.20]Whoa, what was that move?
[130:30.34]What the hell was that?
[130:31.34]I didn't do that before.
[130:32.30]At least he gave me some space.
[130:49.14]That one's longer than the others.
[131:16.10]oh shit okay I'm good
[132:03.10]He was the boss.
[132:05.38]Technically.
[132:08.42]That's sort of weird.
[132:17.23]Yeah, I'll take the free stuff that you left behind.
[132:18.97]A great axe.
[132:22.96]And some more embers.
[132:26.36]Victory!
[132:27.14]Okay.
[132:40.51]Whoa, what's going on in the chat?
[132:41.69]We got a straw poll drama?
[132:44.51]Alright.
[132:45.19]Executive order.
[132:46.43]Executive decision.
[132:48.29]There will be no more straw polls in this chat, and that's final.
[132:52.83]That is final.
[132:56.98]Executive order.
[133:03.98]I've spoken.
[133:10.76]Um...
[133:15.99]Kind of concerned that that was just like a little bonus secret thing.
[133:21.77]It's going to go the other way?
[133:22.55]Because now I can drop down.
[133:24.22]I have to like walk around the edge of this place.
[133:32.72]This is sort of scary.
[133:35.06]I wouldn't do this.
[133:37.40]If I got to this point, I'm just a hero guy.
[133:39.76]Kind of just going to turn around and go home.
[133:45.17]Just gonna be like, yeah, it's just not for me.
[133:48.53]You guys can figure it out.
[133:51.83]Jewel bug.
[133:53.43]Jewel bug.
[133:54.73]Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[133:59.14]Come on, come on.
[134:00.26]No, I didn't.
[134:02.68]Stay here.
[134:04.10]Thank you.
[134:07.12]A large Titanite shard.
[134:11.17]Lightning spear.
[134:14.18]An old dragoon.
[134:17.99]I like this area much better than the last one.
[134:19.83]Because it's... Not a horrible swamp.
[134:31.57]Damn, another one.
[134:34.99]No, no.
[134:36.41]No, don't.
[134:37.89]Stay here.
[134:38.31]Stay.
[134:42.37]I wish there was a move that I could, like, press in the stick and just do a little... Wow, he just tried to backstab me.
[134:58.43]Almost did it, too.
[135:13.23]Okay.
[135:13.69]Can't do anything with this guy, I guess.
[135:16.73]I guess I can't do anything with that guy.
[135:42.61]Come on!
[135:45.03]Please don't roll a one right now.
[135:46.37]I need you to attack.
[135:48.94]And I see he rolled a fucking one and it screwed me up.
[135:51.76]Just spam him.
[135:54.24]Just mash on him.
[135:55.48]And he'll die.
[135:56.84]He's coming down the stairs.
[136:01.26]Probably should have gone back to the bonfire.
[136:08.04]He didn't get it off.
[136:11.80]He didn't.
[136:16.82]I'm going to take a peek and see what's up here and go back to the bonfire.
[136:26.87]Why does it look like they want you to jump off this?
[136:32.89]Huh.
[136:35.03]I don't know.
[136:36.43]Over here, too.
[136:39.74]Huh.
[136:41.78]Praise the sun.
[136:47.77]Praise the sun indeed.
[136:50.91]But praising the sun doesn't pay the bills.
[136:56.24]So.
[137:00.58]What's the point of any of this?
[137:08.34]Uh.
[137:11.42]Huh.
[137:19.48]Should I go down here?
[137:20.56]I mean, it looks like a... Like, yeah, I don't know.
[137:35.01]I don't... I don't know.
[137:40.59]This just brings me back to here.
[137:47.67]Can I, like, walk along the banister?
[137:51.31]I don't think so.
[138:01.15]All the way back there?
[138:01.97]There's no way I could get back there.
[138:09.70]Well... Okay.
[138:20.52]I'm going to take one more look just to make sure I didn't miss something with my eyes.
[138:24.72]Because that's where I come from.
[138:34.91]Can I climb the dragon's body?
[138:56.33]Can I jump to that?
[139:06.16]Well... I'm not sure any of this can do anything.
[139:13.52]I don't think Mr. Dragon Man can be crumbled.
[139:21.98]I think I can't do anything up here anymore.
[139:25.14]Unless I'm missing something, which I don't know if I am.
[139:28.06]If I am, it's pretty obscure.
[139:35.44]They let you come all the way up here.
[139:38.35]There's a bunch of enemies for you to just jump off.
[139:45.27]That doesn't seem right.
[139:48.51]That doesn't seem right at all.
[140:34.57]I didn't think it was gonna... This scream was the funnier... I'm only laughing because of the scream.
[140:39.58]Is there anything down here?
[140:45.34]Well, I need to go get those souls.
[140:53.43]Are you telling me that I have to go back down to the fucking swamp?
[140:57.10]I have to go back down to the swamp.
[140:59.14]I don't want to go back down to the swamp.
[141:03.34]I haven't figured out how to get any fire down there.
[141:07.70]Please don't make me go back down to the swamp.
[141:13.02]That's an illusory wall.
[141:16.52]Hold on, I'm going to do some investigating.
[141:17.88]Alright, it's that way.
[141:26.02]Let's see where we end up when we get out of here.
[141:32.90]So... Can I go around this way?
[141:41.89]Okay, so it's on the other side.
[142:03.54]Where are my souls?
[142:15.05]Didn't I drop down like right here?
[142:16.11]I swear I died like right there.
[142:22.79]Wow!
[142:24.75]Almost went a little bit too far.
[142:40.80]Yeah, all links must be of a PG-13 rating.
[142:46.13]Or the privilege will be removed.
[142:58.08]Stupid bug.
[142:58.80]There they are.
[143:05.14]Alright, where's the wall?
[143:08.98]Where's the illusory wall?
[143:13.06]Where's the guy that's in front of the gate?
[143:15.22]Right down there?
[143:15.89]Okay.
[143:34.61]Come on!
[143:35.49]Give me the eluciary!
[143:45.42]Dark Souls 3 is 16+.
[143:47.55]Well, that may be true.
[143:51.39]But... Lynx?
[143:56.53]Saying you're allowed to post R-rated Lynx is a dangerous, dangerous place to go.
[144:00.98]So, no.
[144:18.38]Alright, let's just go down here and see if I can figure out a git.
[144:23.70]I'm about to just leave this area.
[144:26.69]Let's see, forget it.
[144:27.95]I'm gonna go try to figure out how to light the fire.
[144:29.83]I think it'd be like right there, but it's not.
[144:40.64]Yeah, links have to be like related to the game that I'm playing.
[144:45.19]Or like a discussion we're on.
[144:46.45]You can't just post like, here's a picture of Spongebob mooning somebody.
[144:50.03]That wouldn't make any sense, would it?
[144:54.52]Don't post that, by the way.
[144:58.46]No, you do it.
[145:01.54]Alright, I give up.
[145:04.32]I'm going back to the bonfire.
[145:07.06]I'm going back to Swamp Hellhole to try to figure out how to light the fires.
[145:27.88]I just want to be out of this area.
[145:30.65]I came back here specifically to come all the way back to do this.
[145:33.47]I didn't have to do this.
[145:35.47]But I came all the way back to this obnoxious area of the game.
[145:39.75]The giant swamp up to the castle that has no meaning.
[145:43.10]You fight a super little gray ghost boss at the top.
[145:49.38]There's no other point to this.
[145:51.60]On the surface, it seems.
[145:52.78]And if there is, then I'll be corrected.
[145:54.24]But if there isn't, then this is a waste of my fucking gosh darn time.
[146:03.72]I don't even care.
[146:05.10]It's right around the corner.
[146:05.94]I don't even give a shit.
[146:06.96]Just get me out of here.
[146:17.45]I don't care.
[146:18.15]That place is crap.
[146:21.32]Pity.
[146:35.52]Do I have another one?
[146:47.37]I have a soul, right?
[146:51.29]Let's see what I can get for this.
[146:52.35]I might be able to get something decent.
[147:00.38]I can give it to this guy, right?
[147:05.93]It might just break it.
[147:07.47]That doesn't entice me.
[147:08.13]Yeah, I'll just use it.
[147:31.17]Wow!
[147:32.53]Remember when I said that wasn't worth it?
[147:36.65]It's worth it.
[147:38.99]T'vanguard.
[147:40.67]T'vanguard.
[147:41.53]Thanks for something, dude.
[147:42.39]Welcome back.
[147:44.23]Welcome back, dude.
[147:46.09]Very cool.
[147:46.87]Very cool. ...
[148:01.69]That was good.
[148:05.13]I could level up a few times.
[148:09.96]Do I want to sell?
[148:13.46]Do I want to build a snowman?
[148:17.68]Frozen.
[148:18.02]I don't want these.
[148:21.40]Just take these.
[148:22.30]I don't need the binoculars.
[148:25.80]Take both of these, too.
[148:35.04]Exile Greatsword.
[148:36.04]I'm not going to use it.
[148:37.80]I'm not going to use the rapier.
[148:41.53]I'm not going to use an axe.
[148:42.61]I'm not going to use an even bigger axe.
[148:44.55]I'm not going to use the turkey cutlet.
[148:50.91]Who needs a turkey leg when you have all this other stuff?
[148:54.25]I don't want to use this.
[149:00.34]I'm pretty safe to get rid of this.
[149:01.54]I don't think I want them anymore.
[149:06.22]This is 500 and I don't really want it, so goodbye.
[149:08.50]Yeah, this is too slow for me.
[149:15.67]Too slow.
[149:17.75]Too slow.
[149:18.23]Alright.
[149:24.16]Alright.
[149:32.13]ashen one to be unkindled is to be a vessel for souls sovereignless souls will I will show thee ashen one okay so how do I light the fires there then touch the darkness has to be away
[149:58.40]As a primary strength builder, I'm stuck with a little bit of sadness at you selling the strength weapons.
[150:05.78]Yeah.
[150:06.52]I mean, I'm not... I'm just trying to... Perfect world is I get a sword.
[150:11.03]Or something.
[150:13.15]That's a little bit faster than this.
[150:16.49]I mean, it's just, it's hard sometimes.
[150:19.91]Because this swings fairly slowly for the damage it does.
[150:26.25]It has decent reach, but, you know, when you're going up against a boss and every quarter of a second counts, you kind of want to be moving a little faster.
[150:34.11]I don't have any more of these.
[150:43.81]Oh, I think I got a new, I got an Estus Flask.
[150:57.62]Brings me to eight.
[151:00.89]Okay.
[151:01.35]Let me look at you for a second.
[151:12.35]Torch.
[151:14.45]It's only three hundred.
[151:17.77]Can I sell you something stupid so I can get the 300?
[151:19.29]Because I don't feel like doing it.
[151:20.53]Do you want some booze?
[151:29.58]I will trade you.
[151:39.00]I don't want to drink this because there might be a point when I need that frost resistance.
[151:44.86]You know, take one of these.
[151:48.62]And... Take... Take one of these.
[152:01.37]Let's see if I can light these things.
[152:05.45]I'm kind of desperate right now.
[152:14.17]I'm desperate.
[152:15.83]Let's go light some people on fire.
[152:40.84]Here we go.
[152:52.41]Actually didn't even go this way.
[153:00.27]Yes!
[153:09.16]I found one secret wall.
[153:20.09]Easy now.
[153:21.75]Easy now.
[153:23.49]Easy now.
[153:24.19]There's no one for me to destroy, but thank you for subscribing.
[153:29.41]Welcome to the team.
[153:36.98]So that's it, huh?
[153:37.96]Do I have to go down?
[153:48.98]I've got you I got you I got you I found it I found it yeah what a lucky lucky shot that was and that's exactly what I wanted too alright
[154:18.22]Now, where do I go?
[154:21.70]Down that way.
[154:24.04]Ow, ow, ow, my hands!
[154:25.12]Oh, it's burning!
[154:27.12]Oh, goodness!
[154:40.68]Please work, please work.
[154:43.32]Work, come on.
[154:45.08]Come on, you know you wanna work.
[154:47.36]Come on, light these up.
[154:49.14]You know you want to be lit.
[154:51.44]Get lit up.
[155:01.23]In Dark Souls 2, there was a really dumb thing where you had to kill enemies next to those types of... Let's try that.
[155:10.02]Come here.
[155:15.58]Light the three fires.
[155:22.23]Come over here, let's see if this does anything.
[155:25.21]You're in like the light now.
[155:26.27]You're in like the holy moonlight.
[155:28.27]Alright, come on.
[155:34.53]I sacrificed somebody in front of your door.
[155:36.33]That means you have to open.
[155:39.70]You want another sacrifice?
[155:40.74]I can do that.
[155:41.24]God damn it.
[155:54.50]Yeah, I need to extinguish three flames.
[155:57.84]But what flames do I need to extinguish?
[156:00.02]Extinguish three flames.
[156:02.98]That's the vaguest thing I've ever heard.
[156:04.36]To get access to my domain, you must put out three fires.
[156:13.67]Well... Where are they, Charles?
[156:17.19]Where are they?
[156:25.00]I can't really move here.
[156:25.84]This is not good.
[156:39.85]Somebody's raining hell on me.
[156:44.81]These are just stupid tree branches.
[156:45.93]I don't even want them.
[156:51.91]Come on.
[156:52.09]Keep throwing at him.
[156:53.79]Throw another one.
[156:57.03]Good toss.
[156:57.75]Good toss.
[156:58.22]Keep it up.
[157:00.80]Oh, my giant friend.
[157:02.70]Keep hurting him.
[157:06.24]Wow, I'm not doing anything.
[157:14.60]He's doing all the work.
[157:18.76]This guy just got wrecked.
[157:21.56]Alright, hopefully... Lingering Dragoncrest Ring.
[157:31.41]Thanks for the help.
[157:37.17]Gold pine bundle.
[157:38.21]That's the crappy one.
[157:39.25]A lot of souls.
[158:03.29]I can run.
[158:04.57]Thank you, mummy.
[158:06.61]I've been there before.
[158:07.61]I think I have to do something else somewhere else.
[158:12.52]I'm pretty sure that door probably doesn't open unless I do something else first.
[158:20.04]I have to assume.
[158:25.41]Maybe when I kill certain bosses, those door in the door are like, oh, here we go.
[158:30.11]It opened.
[158:30.61]You put out the boss's flame.
[158:33.17]You extinguished him.
[158:33.97]Because as of right now, I'm at a complete and total loss.
[158:54.21]I'm going to go back here.
[158:55.03]I'm going to turn around.
[158:55.73]Let's start from here.
[159:09.07]Extinguish three flames and open the door to wolf's blood.
[159:21.87]Alright, but like... Can I just roll over these?
[159:27.92]I mean, Extinguish Three Flames.
[159:34.10]There's like... I see six.
[159:37.70]One, two, three, four, five, six fires.
[159:45.83]I don't have like a water gun.
[159:53.84]Come on, I should be able to stomp this out.
[159:56.36]Do I have to knock the, like, tree trunk down?
[160:12.21]There's fire there.
[160:20.79]There's fire there.
[160:23.49]There's fire over here.
[160:24.33]These guys are next to fire.
[160:27.34]I count lots of flames.
[160:39.07]There's quite a few of them.
[160:44.33]Extinguish three flames and open the- What the fuck are you talking about?
[160:48.74]Are you serious?
[160:55.67]I'm gonna ask you guys.
[160:58.42]When somebody asks you to extinguish a flame, do you think, holy shit, a fire on the left?
[161:08.73]Or are you talking about, hey, please blow out my glade-scented candle on the right?
[161:20.08]Yeah, extinguish.
[161:21.20]Please extinguish the flame.
[161:26.16]It only took us, like, an hour to find out that I had to blow a fucking candle out.
[161:44.25]I don't want to be here anymore.
[161:45.69]I don't want to be in this zone.
[161:47.23]This zone gives me bad, bad indigestion.
[161:51.43]Look, you lit the fire.
[161:56.32]Look out!
[161:56.66]Look out!
[161:57.72]There comes a dragon!
[161:59.16]When you light the three fires, a dragon comes out and tries to get you!
[162:06.38]Game sucks.
[162:07.40]Game sucks.
[162:08.40]Game sucks.
[162:11.90]It doesn't.
[162:12.26]I'm kidding.
[162:15.78]Alright, might as well find the other, like, giant pillars.
[162:19.50]Gotta go that way.
[162:22.50]We gotta go to the giant pillar and then blow the candle out.
[162:48.21]Where is it?
[162:49.97]Where is it?
[162:50.83]There it is.
[162:52.93]Please go find the candle.
[162:59.15]Blow out my candle, please.
[163:03.00]I'll extinguish the three flames.
[163:05.02]Hold on, I didn't get this item.
[163:06.02]It's a bone.
[163:08.98]Yay.
[163:10.06]Anything else I didn't see?
[163:17.56]Put it out.
[163:28.51]Got it.
[163:31.54]And my wish is to never come back to the zone ever again.
[163:49.95]Where's the last one?
[163:55.36]The last one might have been right next to me or something.
[163:57.38]Oh shit.
[164:04.40]Fucking Skeksis.
[164:08.72]I'm trying to get killed by the Skeksi dragons.
[164:11.81]Yeah, I'm getting killed.
[164:13.13]Game sucks.
[164:14.07]Game sucks.
[164:15.03]Game sucks.
[164:15.95]Game sucks.
[164:21.99]Happy 31st.
[164:22.59]It's not my birthday.
[164:47.48]Game almost crashed right there.
[164:55.30]A pillar.
[164:55.82]I'm gonna find the other pillar.
[165:08.02]Where is it?
[165:09.82]Where's the other one?
[165:11.92]There?
[165:12.28]I don't know.
[165:19.52]I don't know.
[165:23.72]Get me a tree, Jason.
[165:27.52]Fill up the blaze with trees, Jason.
[165:32.02]Wouldn't that be swell?
[165:36.93]Looking for more trees, Jason.
[165:41.07]Did he extinguish the fire?
[165:44.26]No, boss.
[165:46.45]Good.
[165:48.03]Good.
[165:49.59]Does he know where the other fire is?
[165:52.47]No, he doesn't, boss.
[165:54.29]Also good.
[165:58.30]Game sucks.
[166:01.62]I think it's right there.
[166:02.24]I just saw it.
[166:04.10]Where was it?
[166:04.48]It was like right there.
[166:06.18]It's lost in the trees.
[166:13.53]You guys, seriously, just go to get another hobby.
[166:26.99]Soup.
[166:27.53]I'm almost at the soup.
[166:28.77]I'm almost at the soup.
[166:30.87]Just give me the soup.
[166:32.19]Give me the soup.
[166:33.87]Give me the soup.
[166:35.73]Ah.
[166:38.91]Yeah, I made fun of the soup before.
[166:40.73]Soup just saved my life.
[166:43.11]Oh, he did it.
[166:43.67]I don't know.
[166:49.55]No, he's doing it again.
[166:50.75]One right after the other.
[166:52.21]My god.
[166:53.61]This fucking area is so stupid.
[166:59.91]Sucks.
[167:00.85]Sucks.
[167:01.79]Sucks.
[167:02.47]Game.
[167:03.41]Game.
[167:04.28]Game sucks.
[167:10.34]Does anybody else like moving like this?
[167:13.03]When there are monsters sprinting after you?
[167:17.00]I like that.
[167:17.62]It's fun to move like that.
[167:39.46]Of course, the Jason trees.
[167:42.66]Don't let them see where they're going, Jason.
[167:44.83]Jason!
[167:45.75]Jason!
[167:47.53]Don't let them see where the fire is.
[167:50.27]We don't want them to know where it is.
[167:52.71]We want them to see trees.
[167:57.76]When you look in the sky, Jason, what do you see?
[168:01.18]Uh, stars.
[168:02.52]That's right.
[168:03.68]You're gonna be a star.
[168:05.30]You'll be a game design star when you put these trees in.
[168:09.93]Will I really?
[168:10.47]Of course!
[168:12.45]Who wouldn't think this was the greatest part of the whole game?
[168:15.29]By the way, we do this every game.
[168:16.73]I need to get, like, high ground.
[168:22.61]I gotta get, like, up here.
[168:27.19]I gotta get above the Jason trees.
[168:31.46]What is that noise?
[168:36.92]Somebody is violently eating cake.
[168:38.91]There it is.
[168:40.35]No, that's not it.
[168:41.27]That's just a regular fire, I think.
[168:43.31]Nope.
[168:43.57]There it is.
[168:43.95]There it is.
[168:45.61]Don't fucking kill me.
[168:51.19]He almost got me again with that.
[168:54.44]See?
[168:54.84]He's just going insane.
[169:00.02]And now he's done.
[169:00.96]And now he's done.
[169:01.70]Okay.
[169:02.56]Thanks for being done.
[169:03.82]That way.
[169:04.16]To the right.
[169:06.63]Go.
[169:12.76]Down there.
[169:15.48]Where did he come from?
[169:17.32]He just came from behind one of the trees.
[169:19.33]He's too big to hide behind one of the trees.
[169:22.29]He's too big to hide behind a tree!
[169:23.81]No!
[169:25.33]Come on!
[169:31.01]These fucking psychos!
[169:33.71]God!
[169:35.29]I can't run.
[169:36.05]I can't run.
[169:37.23]Just get me to the fire.
[169:38.37]Get me to the fire.
[169:39.23]Get me to the fire.
[169:40.11]It's over here somewhere.
[169:42.76]Get me to the fire.
[169:52.14]Oh, boy.
[169:52.62]I think I have to kill these things.
[169:59.53]Where was it?
[169:59.89]It was like right here, right?
[170:03.37]It's like right... Oh, somewhere where I'm... Please, you cannot even begin to try to...
[170:09.96]Where is it?
[170:11.32]It's, like, here.
[170:15.11]God, they're everywhere.
[170:16.97]They are everywhere.
[170:20.91]Where even is it now?
[170:28.69]They, like, don't want you to play this map.
[170:32.83]They, like, don't want you to play this game.
[170:39.25]I'm going to have to go extremely slowly and kill every single enemy.
[170:44.76]I just have to.
[170:48.64]It's not physically possible for me.
[170:51.84]Unless I kill every single enemy.
[170:55.56]Besides the slugs, they get to live.
[170:59.92]Slugs didn't do shit.
[171:03.81]And I already lost my place already.
[171:09.03]My god You know I would I would chant game sucks or this game sucks But I you know I'm just not feeling it I'm just not feeling it not Jason Jason Have to kill these guys okay is there going to be one of those little shits that sprints behind I
[171:49.69]That probably, like, rakes up leaves at you.
[171:52.68]Cool, like, leaf raking move.
[171:55.04]With the homing missiles.
[171:55.98]Oh my god.
[172:11.47]At least I don't interrupt you.
[172:13.43]That would be terrible.
[172:20.89]There's one.
[172:22.83]I killed one of them.
[172:26.57]Let's get this straight.
[172:38.22]Where is it?
[172:45.76]It's in that direction, but I just want to make sure I'm going the right way.
[172:49.86]Get to the top.
[172:52.37]Heal.
[172:54.57]Don't let this guy do any moves.
[172:55.97]Just keep him comboed.
[172:58.05]He jumps.
[172:58.67]Of course he does.
[173:13.98]These guys are just the most erratic enemy I think I've ever fought in a video game.
[173:20.96]Are they going to jump straight in the air?
[173:22.40]Are they going to try to dive?
[173:23.08]Are they going to go on all fours?
[173:23.94]I don't know.
[173:27.94]There it is.
[173:30.57]Right?
[173:31.11]I think that has to be it.
[173:32.23]I'm going to go to that fire.
[173:36.45]And then it's exactly like 1 o'clock.
[173:41.63]That way.
[173:51.77]So it's like over here.
[173:54.65]Hopefully I don't have to aggro this one, but I probably am going to.
[173:57.25]That seems to be the unfortunate thing.
[174:00.57]Maybe I'm just going to wait.
[174:05.02]Wait for this dude to just turn around.
[174:06.60]I really don't want to fight him.
[174:16.80]Straight this way.
[174:20.65]I'm going to get surrounded by... I'm going to heal.
[174:23.73]Because here comes a bunch of ground guys.
[174:28.87]There's the soup.
[174:29.89]It's down past the soup.
[174:33.87]Up over that way.
[174:40.05]Up there, I think.
[174:42.93]Fairly certain.
[174:49.99]We don't need to kill the slugs.
[174:50.97]The slugs are our friends.
[174:52.16]They do not pose an immediate threat.
[175:02.00]Looked like it was over here, right?
[175:07.06]Get some high ground again.
[175:08.14]Yep, right there.
[175:11.20]I'm going to just sit here.
[175:25.13]Straight ahead.
[175:25.61]Get me out of this nightmare.
[175:29.53]I want to wake up from the nightmare.
[175:38.33]Yeah, come on over here.
[175:39.65]Haha, cutscene.
[175:45.73]He's about to stomp me with his giant rabbit's foot.
[175:50.57]That was perfect.
[176:03.54]Let me get out of here.
[176:04.34]Let me get out of here.
[176:05.10]Get me out of here.
[176:05.88]Get me out of here.
[176:15.18]Feels like we've been in the swamp forever.
[176:16.94]We have been in the swamp forever.
[176:22.06]Although I took a detour and I went up and I like fought the secret mini boss.
[176:30.89]Didn't think you guys would still be here.
[176:33.91]Did not understand that that was a possibility.
[176:38.57]Funny, because he ended his animation.
[176:42.40]It came back right where his animation started.
[176:44.38]Right where it stopped there.
[176:45.76]Isn't it right here?
[177:09.22]It's right over here, right?
[177:10.76]I think?
[177:16.38]Maybe it isn't.
[177:19.65]This place has got me so topsy-turvy and turned around.
[177:21.81]I thought it was right here, but I guess I'm wrong.
[177:40.69]I'll eventually find it, don't worry.
[177:48.68]Where the hell was this dumb place?
[178:11.92]I just don't remember.
[178:18.54]Swamp, swamp.
[178:22.77]Wait, this is fun.
[178:24.73]Everybody having fun?
[178:27.39]Hey, we having fun?
[178:30.45]Everybody having fun?
[178:39.98]I'm going to have a nightmare where I goomba stomp you in a swamp.
[178:44.49]Well, I kind of want to get this item.
[178:51.42]No, actually that was worth it.
[178:52.26]It was two Titanite shards.
[179:05.54]Ooh, and I just drank it and it's gone immediately.
[179:09.50]I'm dead.
[179:09.98]It's hard for me to remember where I'm going, where every single thing in this entire zone is exactly the same.
[179:22.98]There's a couple of stairs.
[179:29.75]Which way was it?
[179:41.65]I don't remember.
[179:42.69]I really don't fucking remember.
[179:46.59]It's on one of the edges.
[179:47.74]That's all I know.
[179:48.48]This is why the NPCs all sit in Firelink Shrine all day.
[180:09.30]Okay, I think it's over here.
[180:10.38]Pretty sure I remember it being like back here behind this psycho.
[180:29.03]Is he still following me?
[180:31.35]Get a grip, man!
[180:43.85]I'm like back around here.
[180:52.17]It's like the other bonfire.
[180:58.05]Drop down.
[181:08.68]Can't believe Dark Souls is made by one guy.
[181:15.49]Oh, I found it!
[181:16.85]There it is.
[181:17.23]I'm only being chased by almost the whole zone.
[181:23.44]Just don't look back, don't look back.
[181:24.58]Just like when you're up climbing the ladder, don't look down.
[181:26.22]If you look back, you're dead.
[181:48.62]Okay, take a minute here.
[181:51.86]Can I slam that door closed?
[181:53.10]That would be nice.
[182:10.11]Oh, shit.
[182:15.17]Pissed them all off.
[182:15.75]Give me the item.
[182:21.74]These are the Wizard of Oz monkeys.
[182:23.20]I hate these guys.
[182:23.96]This has got to be like a bonfire right here, right?
[182:45.00]It has to be.
[182:50.46]What's happening?
[182:52.70]What's with the fight going on?
[182:59.02]I don't want any part of that bonfire.
[183:00.26]It has to be... Come on, right here.
[183:06.63]Oh, come on.
[183:07.59]You said try right.
[183:11.01]Come on.
[183:24.70]At least I have the bonfire.
[183:32.45]Where am I?
[183:32.95]I'm still in the swamp.
[183:36.31]Farron Keep Perimeter.
[183:42.05]Let's go check it out.
[183:46.61]Let's do a little test.
[183:49.91]See where we are.
[183:53.17]Oh boy.
[183:53.65]These guys fight.
[183:54.19]Let them fight.
[183:59.79]Go guys.
[184:01.05]I'm rooting for you.
[184:05.48]Just taking a sip of my drink.
[184:38.14]I'll stay back even further.
[184:47.32]Items.
[184:53.52]Items.
[184:59.82]Ah, stupid.
[185:03.79]Got.
[185:06.05]For a second I thought I was doing that I thought this guy's health pool was still there and I killed him four times That was kind of freaky It was a little bit freaky Jesus Do you guys split up or do you stay together?
[185:33.81]You split up, huh?
[185:35.89]Oh, that's what we call a mistake.
[185:39.51]Don't ever split up.
[185:40.92]That's how you get yourselves killed.
[185:42.10]I thought I was holding a bow.
[186:05.08]Dark leggings.
[186:06.02]Cool.
[186:10.33]Where's the other guy?
[186:14.37]What kind of accent is that?
[186:15.39]A bad one.
[186:15.85]I'm not sure.
[186:32.28]What's making that sound?
[186:35.37]Oh, one of these guys.
[186:36.15]One of these dummies.
[186:44.58]Screw it.
[186:55.96]Where's her chest?
[186:58.87]I don't even find it.
[187:00.51]Scared me.
[187:03.95]Destroy him!
[187:06.65]Whoa.
[187:07.33]Whoa.
[187:09.69]Shimmy Sham.
[187:10.55]What's going on, Shimmy Sham?
[187:16.12]Welcome.
[187:17.04]Welcome to the group.
[187:19.80]Welcome to the group.
[187:39.60]I'm trying to backstab this dude, but it's a little bit hard when you have a giant scythe.
[187:44.32]Ooh.
[187:47.96]Ooh.
[187:52.58]Rotten crew spear.
[188:00.84]Is somebody casting spells at me?
[188:04.13]What am I hearing right now?
[188:12.54]Rotten Groove Curved Sword.
[188:13.92]This guy's dropping.
[188:17.76]Ooh.
[188:22.29]Hold on a second.
[188:35.57]I kind of like this thing.
[188:43.09]That's pretty good damage to 103 32 base Well I can compare Okay, so this is 103 32 this one's 126 46 Both this one's bad scaling, but it has C scaling
[189:14.36]I kind of think it's cool.
[189:16.92]Let's try it.
[189:18.52]What's the... Wait, what's the... I want to see the ability it has.
[189:23.82]Spin slash.
[189:24.48]Slice and defuse with a large spinning motion and follow.
[189:26.36]Okay, it's the same thing from the other one.
[189:28.34]It's this thing.
[189:32.40]That's really fast for two-handing it.
[189:38.65]What's the charge attack with two-hand?
[189:41.87]Nice.
[189:57.33]Black bug pellet.
[190:01.35]We'll give this thing a whirl.
[190:12.16]This is kind of weird.
[190:17.77]Don't get stuck on the swords, please.
[190:27.49]Whoa, well, it's like they have five arms.
[190:30.15]They're all in each other.
[190:31.81]They're inside of each other.
[190:41.48]Guys, together, I just don't think I'm gonna... I kind of have to get used to the new weapon, too.
[191:06.68]I actually really dig this thing.
[191:12.39]I really dig this thing.
[191:15.03]Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby!
[191:17.25]I'm gonna use it, oh baby!
[191:18.77]I might have to upgrade this thing.
[191:30.06]Be wary of ambush, but try play dead.
[191:41.79]Boss room?
[191:43.07]Boss room.
[191:44.95]I'm gonna go back and upgrade this a couple times.
[191:46.76]Because I actually really like it.
[191:59.56]It's nice and quick.
[192:02.78]It's got a nice feel to it.
[192:03.71]It's got some good weight.
[192:05.65]It might be ugly as sin, but... You know.
[192:10.46]Some weapons you use aren't pretty.
[192:13.83]I'm looking for an excuse to take off the scythe for at least a hot minute, you know how they say.
[192:21.30]This is the perimeter.
[192:43.73]1,000.
[192:45.87]How much is this one?
[192:46.65]I hope it's more than 1,000.
[192:47.75]2,000.
[192:48.11]What can you do for me?
[193:01.05]Let's actually go with some more health.
[193:04.14]I want to get this to 20.
[193:05.20]I'm putting... getting vigor to 20 before I do anything else.
[193:09.87]But let me put some shards into this thing.
[193:12.59]And really just smoke some.
[193:15.49]Dudes.
[193:17.19]There we go, boys.
[193:17.77]Boys and girls!
[193:32.23]With me doing this +2, it's already better than the scythe.
[193:39.82]And it's way faster.
[193:40.76]I can also infuse it, can't I?
[193:44.00]Magic.
[193:50.97]Magic.
[193:54.81]I mean, should I, like, do some elemental?
[193:56.49]No, because that scales with... Yeah, that would have to be, like, raw gem or refined gem.
[194:06.83]Probably raw.
[194:07.50]Because once you start to put in this type of magic shit, doesn't it have to scale off of intelligence or something?
[194:18.76]Or at least some of them do.
[194:21.36]Whatever.
[194:22.08]For now, we're good to go.
[194:22.98]Be careful.
[194:23.70]I don't want it.
[194:31.08]This is a poison area, so I'm going to keep poison on my bar.
[194:33.43]I have a feeling it's going to be something annoying like that.
[194:38.71]Watch out for the poison, people.
[194:40.51]Wait a minute, didn't I get another... I did, yeah.
[194:46.69]Let's see what she can give me now.
[194:51.86]Where did Star happen upon the star?
[194:59.78]What?
[195:01.08]She wants to know where I found it?
[195:05.08]Where did I find it?
[195:07.66]Uh, yeah, sure, whatever.
[195:09.04]What does she care?
[195:09.58]Whatever you say, lady.
[195:26.95]Fully restores FP.
[195:28.31]I can buy green blossoms now.
[195:32.21]That's kind of a big deal.
[195:33.63]That's actually a really big deal.
[195:41.07]Arrows.
[195:41.69]She's got a lot of cool stuff now.
[195:46.63]And she sells gold pine resin now.
[195:48.47]Yeah!
[195:49.19]Hey, hip hip.
[195:52.87]Can I get a hip hip hooray?
[195:54.61]Hip hip hooray.
[195:56.85]Ashen one.
[195:57.79]Okay, let's look at the armor.
[196:08.29]We got something new, didn't we?

[196:57.66]Okie dokie.
[196:59.58]Don't make much sense to me.
[197:01.00]And then right after that one we have RandomMan2377.
[197:12.31]Thanks, both of yous.
[197:26.26]This looks like a picture you would take on the first day of school.
[197:30.82]This is like a six-year-old.
[197:33.98]In his Halloween costume.
[197:37.16]Can you picture me, ma'am?
[197:44.22]Herald armor.
[197:47.12]How much equipment load?
[197:48.03]It's actually better.
[197:49.61]For equipment load.
[197:50.89]Probably looks cooler, too.
[198:02.90]Pants Where's the other who is Harold here Remember what I said in the very beginning that you're never gonna see this guy's face You suck yeah, I just saw Leather jacket this Jim carries the mask the actual mask It really does look like his mask

[199:39.19]Ooh, cutscene.
[199:51.23]Two guys.
[199:52.15]What the hell?
[199:54.17]Did he just kill himself?
[200:01.36]This is the same guy.
[200:07.02]You're next.
[200:17.19]Huh.
[200:21.69]It's just Abyss Watchers.
[200:34.01]I'm gonna hang back for a minute here.
[200:35.25]Let's see what he does Alright, who's dying over there?
[200:42.21]They're still fighting.
[200:43.37]I see Abyss Watchers, but there's one guy Well that explains it See ya, you're dead
[201:00.77]This is going to be one of those stupid witch fights where I have to kill the clones.
[201:07.95]I hope not.
[201:19.08]They're fighting each other!
[201:23.58]Will they just kill each other?
[201:27.84]Chronic Waffle, thanks.
[201:28.67]I'm just going to blend fight.
[201:34.16]What the hell is going on?
[201:37.82]Go ahead.
[201:38.48]Fight.
[201:38.96]Fight it out.
[201:40.38]I'll just sit here and watch.
[201:42.34]Oh yeah, that's right.
[201:43.02]Knife.
[201:44.26]From the audience.
[201:44.92]There's a reckless guy in the audience throwing fucking knives.
[201:55.37]How you going?
[202:13.21]No, don't fight me.
[202:13.87]Fight him.
[202:14.63]Fight each other.
[202:16.01]Fight each other.
[202:18.79]Fight each other.
[202:19.55]Don't fight me.
[202:22.17]You don't want to fight me.
[202:24.05]I don't know which one's the real one.
[202:26.32]It's that guy.
[202:26.84]That guy's the real one.
[202:27.56]Alright, how are you going?
[202:35.30]Wait, not yet.
[202:39.82]Kill him.
[202:41.62]Kill him.
[202:45.57]Somebody just said this is a deathmatch.
[202:46.99]It really is.
[202:52.76]I didn't.
[202:53.34]I went in too early.
[202:55.66]Kill each other.
[202:56.92]Forget about me.
[202:59.78]You know what?
[203:00.07]I'll kill you if I need to.
[203:01.09]Alright.
[203:10.61]Just keep fighting.
[203:19.54]Run away.
[203:21.20]Run away!
[203:21.68]Are you done spawning people?
[203:24.82]Should I just fight you now?
[203:32.85]That was fucking easy.
[203:34.53]Did I win?
[203:35.03]Is it over?
[203:35.45]Did I just win?
[203:45.21]No, no way.
[203:46.27]Yeah, no way.
[203:47.62]Now I have to fight the real boss.
[203:54.66]They're gonna all go into him and make him strong.
[204:02.10]Now he has a fire sword.
[204:03.18]Alright, now this is where the real boss fight begins.
[204:12.96]Great.
[204:13.54]I spoke too soon.
[204:17.29]Nope.
[204:19.23]Okay.
[204:22.89]Let the games begin.
[204:31.78]Cool music though Wow Okay fire fire put out that fire Jeez you do a lot of moves
[205:00.95]Alright, so new strategy, I gotta dodge a different direction when he does that.
[205:03.87]Kind of just gotta stay close to him, I think.
[205:45.02]Yeah.
[205:46.10]Unfortunately, I wasted two or three Estus flasks just trying to keep myself at 100%.
[205:57.12]That first phase is sort of just pointless.
[206:04.47]It's like that whole thing is like an extended cutscene that I don't want to watch again.
[206:14.94]Hold on a second.
[206:15.64]Let's get some fire resist on.
[206:19.06]Do I have a fire resist ring?
[206:20.18]Not really.
[206:32.60]Fire!
[206:33.24]No, I think I'll be fine here.
[206:44.74]Maybe when I walk in he'll just be fire guy.
[206:48.57]I kind of hope.
[206:57.37]Come on.
[206:59.53]You know, next time I'm just going to run in the front door.
[207:01.20]Oh, my God.
[207:03.28]You know what?
[207:03.88]You stupid piece of dog shit enemies.
[207:08.04]And your gigantic reach and your fucking run 100 mile per hour dog burrito.
[207:12.32]I...
[207:28.68]Yeah, I shouldn't be wrapped around.
[207:29.90]Those enemies are so annoying.
[207:31.54]I'd rather just run right through the front fucking door.
[207:33.40]Because I don't have to stop.
[207:37.64]I can just run.
[207:38.38]I say that now and this is actually turning out to be the worst place to go.
[207:46.05]There have to be this many of them.
[207:52.03]Really just putting a damper on my day.
[207:56.55]Moronic enemies.
[207:59.19]Nah, we'll have to fight him again.
[208:00.41]Just need to let him fight.
[208:27.74]Fight each other, not me.
[208:34.35]Both.
[208:37.03]You kind of just want to keep fighting me, don't you?
[208:41.44]Come on!
[208:44.06]You were fighting each other before.
[208:45.34]Why do I just stop now?
[208:56.89]I'm just like in the fray.
[208:57.99]Can you just accidentally hit him please?
[209:24.42]Oh god.
[209:30.42]Alright.
[209:30.94]Maybe I just need to wait till they're all dead.
[209:33.41]I'm not going until every single person over there is dead.
[209:42.15]You just have to be an observer for the first half of this fight.
[209:44.75]This is what I was talking about.
[209:47.31]It's like an extended cutscene.
[209:53.29]I have to watch the extended cutscene.
[209:56.71]Look at that big fight!
[209:57.94]Alright, let's play!
[210:08.90]I'm really burning through Estus flasks right now.
[210:23.40]Whoa!
[210:24.32]What are you doing over here?
[210:25.12]I don't care about fighting one of you.
[210:42.47]I gotta get in there with at least four.
[210:43.83]It would be a shame if I had less than four.
[210:52.13]I'm gonna have less than four.
[210:53.03]In fact, I might die.
[210:54.37]Alright, let's try this again.
[211:07.76]Just gotta be careful.
[211:12.54]Don't dodge forward, dodge left and right.
[211:14.52]Because he does the fire, like, right in front of him.
[211:36.89]Just trying to learn the moves right now, see what he does.
[211:38.79]Ooh, he went the same way as I did.
[212:14.11]Can he be parried?
[212:14.89]I wonder.
[212:17.07]It's even worth trying.
[212:20.98]Should I just be very careful?
[212:22.26]Oh boy.
[212:40.65]Oh boy.
[213:19.30]Oh, lost item.
[213:19.98]Ah, shit.
[213:23.50]Shit.
[213:28.57]Ah, shit.
[213:30.93]That was kind of... That flame was delayed.
[213:34.27]That was like... He did the move, and there was no indicator that the flames were coming up.
[213:37.85]That was kind of caught my eye.
[213:38.91]That was weird.
[213:43.49]Go in there with more Estus, and I should get it.
[213:45.09]Fine.
[213:46.31]And the first part is really slow and really awful.
[213:50.71]But you just have to be patient.
[213:53.65]Because if I could have healed, like, been safe to heal a couple more times, it would have been alright.
[214:05.50]I could try parrying him.
[214:06.36]That's not a bad idea.
[214:07.34]I'll try it.
[214:09.08]That's extremely dangerous, though.
[214:12.92]It's very, very dangerous.
[214:14.54]But, you know what?
[214:15.28]I'll give it a shot.
[214:17.81]Not in the first phase.
[214:21.29]Actually, why not?
[214:27.10]Actually, we weren't in fucking dust.
[214:28.46]I don't think I can parry that move.
[214:38.09]Yeah, you can.
[214:40.33]You can parry him!
[214:42.53]Interesting.
[214:43.59]I wonder if you can do it when his sword is on fire.
[214:51.63]Get me out of there!
[214:56.69]Ooh, you are both so close.
[214:58.83]Fight each other!
[214:59.43]You don't want to fight me!
[215:02.22]Come on.
[215:10.16]You can backstab him, too.
[215:19.74]That's really interesting.
[215:24.28]No, they're coming over here.
[215:26.17]That's not good.
[215:28.59]Jesus.
[215:32.03]This guy is way more aggressive this time around.
[215:34.59]I don't like this strategy.
[215:37.63]I'm just going to see if I can parry him.
[215:41.56]Because I'm kind of trying to rush it.
[215:44.50]I didn't even see that guy.
[215:45.34]I'm trying to backstab him.
[215:58.95]That guy just got piledrived.
[216:01.45]He just got an absolute neck-breaking piledriver right there.
[216:06.78]Yeah, this is a wash.
[216:07.72]I just want to see if I can carry him during the second phase.
[216:12.54]This one's a wash run.
[216:16.11]Okay, that was not fair.
[216:18.29]That was not fucking fair.
[216:19.67]I started right next to him.
[216:24.69]Well, I don't know if that would have been a parry or not, but maybe not.
[216:36.20]Wow, you can parry him in the second phase!
[216:39.16]You can parry him in phase two.
[216:40.68]That's kind of cool.
[216:44.36]Is it worth it?
[216:47.22]I'm not sure it's worth it, because if you miss the parry, only 220 damage.
[216:51.32]I can do that in two swings.
[217:08.24]Because it's really dangerous to try to parry him in that second phase.
[217:10.84]Because he can almost kill you in one swing.
[217:12.36]Oh my god.
[217:44.15]Don't be stupid.
[217:44.81]Don't play stupid.
[217:48.41]Wait for the first batch.
[217:58.29]Where are they?
[218:00.36]Okay, here they are.
[218:02.64]That's not a good spot for that guy.
[218:03.72]They'll be spawning!
[218:09.84]My god, what a pain in the ass.
[218:17.81]Wait, these guys are still... Get out of my way!
[218:21.76]Leave me alone!
[218:22.68]There's always one that just seems to want to kill me with everything he has.
[218:28.34]Goodness.
[218:36.13]I might just let him kill me.
[218:38.11]Because this is not good.
[218:39.99]He's just been up my ass the entire time.
[218:44.66]Wait, this is the boss.
[218:46.38]Okay.
[218:49.32]I thought that they... I was wondering, I was like, why is this guy not dying?
[219:00.55]Usually they take like five hits.
[219:20.71]Yeah, being aggressive works because you can keep them staggered.
[219:24.04]They, you know, you stunlock them.
[219:25.86]I thought that was not the boss.
[219:28.51]But, uh, besides the fact that the health bars, they are identical.
[219:51.15]The most trouble I'm having with this guy is, is he going to do two swings or four swings?
[219:56.86]So hard to tell.
[219:57.80]Fight it out.
[220:08.62]Just running around in a circle until they fight each other.
[220:18.78]Really?
[220:19.56]You're really gonna chase me all the way down here?
[220:21.90]Fucking piece of crap.
[220:38.39]Ugh, this swings so many times.
[220:40.25]I'm gonna die again.
[220:48.18]I wish I didn't have to do this every time.
[220:50.30]Run away!
[221:10.63]Shit.
[221:11.65]Oh, they both spawned right here!
[221:12.95]No!
[221:15.87]Go into the arena!
[221:24.93]Fine, I'm gonna take the ember.
[221:26.69]I didn't realize that.
[221:29.92]Let's go.
[221:31.16]Kill each other.
[221:34.36]I keep forgetting about that.
[221:39.88]All the way back here, while you were in the middle of that fight.
[221:44.31]Like, come on dude.
[221:46.49]Oh boy.
[221:49.81]What made this guy turn around and decide he wanted to kill me instead?
[221:54.42]I don't really know.
[221:59.10]Might be able to get right up behind him here.
[222:08.55]Okay, let's give it a try.
[222:11.43]He's beating my ass right now.
[222:35.62]I gotta get some distance.
[222:41.04]That fake out with the hand.
[222:43.39]He like pretends to swing the sword, but punches.
[222:57.61]Just not close enough.
[223:24.13]I'm dead.
[223:24.49]Well, that was close, but I'm definitely dead.
[223:48.52]I'm getting him down to like half every time.
[224:12.04]I Really wish I could just skip phase one and actually fight the boss I Feel like that's the the name of the game in Dark Souls 3 half of these bosses have been
[224:23.51]Come into the boss room, ready to fight the boss.
[224:26.36]But you're gonna go through like a full phase where you don't actually fight the boss.
[224:30.80]Now fight the boss.
[224:31.64]I don't know.
[225:25.85]I know I'm gonna use the Ember don't worry The reason I haven't used it yet is because if I need I want to try to not have to use a flask here So I could get full health from the Ember this shouldn't be He's just still right up my bum
[225:47.69]That looks like a wash at this point, so I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to kill this dude.
[225:51.33]I don't know if I can kill him.
[225:56.05]Come on, I gotta kill this guy.
[225:57.21]I can't let him kill me.
[225:59.33]Woo!
[226:10.26]That's the plan, at least.
[226:13.96]You know, there is a guy behind me who could be fighting.
[226:27.46]If you're gonna be like this, then fine.
[226:32.32]Shit, smoke.
[226:48.34]Fucking smoke!
[226:55.54]I can't see anything!
[227:00.53]I wish the ember was on my bar right now.
[227:02.13]That would help a lot.
[227:10.53]Okay, here we go.
[227:25.71]Okay, come on, let's go, let's go, let's do it!
[227:39.75]Shiet...
[228:08.81]such a far reach underestimate how far that can actually go sometimes
[228:57.28]This is kind of new.
[229:39.76]Gotta get some distance here.
[229:59.34]Shit, it's right when I get distance, but I got lucky!
[230:28.31]Goodbye.
[230:34.49]That took energy for me.
[230:37.35]That took energy for me.
[230:41.51]I was completely quiet.
[230:42.63]Sorry I was not speaking.
[230:45.11]But that guy was not the easiest dude.
[230:47.29]A lot of souls, too.
[230:55.89]First try.
[230:57.93]I don't know how the hell you would ever beat any of these bosses first try.
[231:02.23]I have no idea.
[231:07.86]Huh?
[231:10.96]Can I not light this bonfire?
[231:13.10]What the hell's going on?
[231:21.73]What the hell's going on?
[231:29.31]You beat the rotting tree first try?
[231:32.77]Damn.
[231:37.08]From what I understand, from what people are saying, people are having trouble with that boss.
[231:54.06]Should I take a homeward bone?
[231:55.73]I don't want to go down here with 20,000 souls.
[231:59.68]Is it because there's a guy in the doorway and thinks I'm in combat still?
[232:07.60]I think these guys are screwing everything up.
[232:11.99]Yeah, these guys are definitely messing everything up.
[232:15.29]Can you guys please get out of here?
[232:16.55]Because I think the game thinks I'm still in the boss fight.
[232:20.46]Guess what that guy rolled?
[232:23.77]That guy rolled a 1 to 1.
[232:26.25]Sometimes it happens, unfortunately.
[232:28.53]This guy rolled a 1 as well.
[232:35.56]Not the brightest.
[232:36.68]Not the brightest bunch.
[232:49.98]Yeah, see?
[233:02.77]Let's go level up.
[233:13.54]I think the rotting tree gives people trouble because... You have to like hit specific points on his body.
[233:20.58]And for some characters it can be kind of hard to do that if you're using like a big slow two-hander.
[233:24.68]He moves around a lot.
[233:29.47]What can I get from this?
[233:32.38]Let's go find out before I smash the damn thing.
[233:40.89]It's actually funny, like, this is like... Talking about, like, hard bosses and, like, figuring out bosses.
[233:46.13]That's one of the reasons why I was hesitant to stream this game.
[233:48.41]Because I'd never done anything like this before.
[233:51.86]And... Trying to figure out a boss in front of an audience... Of people that are like, oh, is he gonna kill this guy or what?
[233:58.54]You just, in your mind, you're like...
[234:00.90]I've got to figure this out.
[234:02.02]I've got to figure out how to do this.
[234:03.64]I'm going to let down all these people.
[234:13.82]Wolf Knight's Greatsword, huh?
[234:17.84]Baron Ultra... Ooh.
[234:22.42]Ooh.
[234:27.82]Shit.
[234:28.62]That's an Ultra...
[234:31.79]A thing can parry?
[234:34.05]Deflect an attack when timed properly and follow up with a crit.
[234:36.25]So I don't have to have to have the shield anymore?
[234:51.67]Most people here are just your fans.
[234:53.03]They want to see you playing.
[234:54.01]Yeah, no, I understand that.
[234:55.16]But at the same time, you know, you also want to keep like a level of some quality.
[235:00.66]You know what I mean?
[235:01.12]Where I'm not just like, I don't know what I suck.
[235:03.85]I'm dying to the same boss a hundred times.
[235:06.65]That's why I was like scared to play it on stream.
[235:14.30]I kind of want this.
[235:15.28]I kind of want all these items.
[235:17.94]I feel... I probably get so many souls for breaking it down, though.
[235:22.17]Is it really worth me putting this on and saying I don't like this?
[235:25.37]It sure is.
[235:25.83]I want to see what it looks like.
[235:31.81]I want to see.
[235:33.83]I still need some strength, though.
[235:48.66]What the hell was that?
[235:50.00]What is this move?
[235:53.26]You, like, fall down and swing.
[235:56.73]Oh.
[236:02.31]I don't know.
[236:02.91]It's... Oh, shit!
[236:05.25]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[236:19.78]Damn, this is really cool.
[236:22.00]You get a parry dagger in your other hand.
[236:24.52]And you can do the skiing slide swing.
[236:30.90]I don't know, guys.
[236:33.40]I keep having second thoughts.
[236:37.72]Let me put the two points in strength, because I'm going to put them in anyways.
[236:41.17]No, no, no.
[236:41.71]I had a very important... Maybe later.
[236:46.53]Because I did want to get to 20 vigor.
[236:53.21]I made that promise to myself that I was going to have 20 bigger.
[236:55.59]I'm going to hold on to it.
[237:00.60]For now, I'm going to stay with the rotten one.
[237:11.81]I guess we're going to keep going.
[237:23.68]this watchers medieval green goblin yeah I kind of do odd that a lot of these big two-handers seem to be dex weapons I'm not sure why that is
[237:53.65]Catacombs of Pothos.
[237:57.31]Welcome to the next area of the game.
[238:02.09]Good luck.
[238:04.84]You'll need it.
[238:05.56]A lot of places to fall, a very long way.
[238:12.24]Oh shit, skeleton warriors.
[238:25.76]You're gonna eventually do that and fall.
[238:26.98]I knew you were gonna fall.
[238:28.94]I knew it.
[238:30.12]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[238:31.32]I feel like that's the safest thing to do to you here.
[238:48.82]Alright.
[238:50.92]Alright!
[238:53.48]Carlos Rouge?
[239:00.44]This place reminds me of the Chalice Dungeons in Bloodborne.
[239:07.11]The way that it's set up.
[239:08.39]Very long.
[239:10.55]The same asset, probably, too.
[239:11.87]Even the skeletons.
[239:16.60]That, my friends, is why you don't lock onto people on a bridge.
[239:22.14]Unless you're in a safe place.
[239:33.50]You have a long swing.
[239:36.49]We both have long... Look at how long that guy's swing was.
[239:39.35]He just torpedoed.
[239:51.57]I thought he was dead.
[239:55.71]Thought wrong.
[240:06.50]I better come out down there somewhere.
[240:07.82]Hey.
[240:10.80]Not cool.
[240:14.97]Yeah, this is very Chalice Dungeon Bloodborne-y for sure, especially inside of this room.
[240:21.37]I'm in a Chalice Dungeon right now.
[240:24.01]That's what this is.
[240:39.11]This game got too spooky.
[240:40.11]It kind of did.
[240:40.55]Kind of got spooky, didn't it?
[240:50.16]Right in the neck.
[240:54.58]Get rid of this dude first.
[241:06.32]I love how you turn into Yoda when you use this thing's sword art.
[241:15.81]I actually haven't found much use at all for these sword art things.
[241:22.49]Unfortunately.
[241:25.25]They feel very gimmicky.
[241:27.42]Like doing it actually is detrimental to what you're trying to do.
[241:30.60]Because at what point are you actually really going to do this?
[241:36.70]I mean, you could just go like this.
[241:38.62]Then the guy will take the same damage.
[241:40.02]I don't know.
[241:58.41]Oh, the egg.
[242:00.53]Did someone ask for an egg?
[242:09.19]Invisible.
[242:15.32]I can see through you.
[242:22.56]Pyromancy.
[242:25.30]Nice moves.
[242:29.00]You just wanted to show me how you can roll?
[242:30.32]Nice.
[242:33.32]Nice job.
[242:45.35]I think we're down over here.
[242:46.05]Guess that was for the pyromancy tomb.
[243:00.58]The tome.
[243:02.04]The tome.
[243:11.21]You are sort of tougher than most, aren't you?
[243:28.32]Jeez.
[243:30.12]You are fast.
[243:38.71]Sharp gem.
[243:41.31]That's new.
[243:41.85]I thought that was a caterpillar.
[243:46.96]Let's see how far this goes.
[243:48.56]I'm curious.
[243:49.90]Where's the bone caterpillar gonna go?
[243:53.78]Go on.
[243:54.16]Keep going.
[243:55.52]Go on.
[243:58.05]Come on, keep going.
[243:58.97]You can make it.
[244:00.43]You can make it home.
[244:02.30]Go home.
[244:02.88]Oh, I want to help him over the ledge.
[244:09.60]Can I help him?
[244:11.68]He just wants to get out of here.
[244:12.63]Come on, I'll help you.
[244:18.89]Oh, he's stuck here forever.
[244:29.99]Shit.
[244:44.46]Now he's just spinning around.
[244:49.92]He turned into a top.
[244:51.88]First he was a caterpillar.
[244:53.64]Now he was a top.
[245:05.40]Guys, really, really making this so easy for me.
[245:10.04]He's going to drop a lot of shards, though.
[245:15.53]That's good.
[245:30.09]I wonder if he's gonna still be going.
[245:31.12]Alright, what does this say?
[245:33.66]Ah, trap.
[245:38.92]There's lots of bloodstains here.
[245:41.64]Alright, guys.
[245:42.14]Let's just say our prayers here.
[245:46.65]I think I'm gonna try to make that jump.
[245:57.10]Shit.
[246:25.19]I feel like I'm backtracking back where I was before.
[246:31.87]No, I guess not.
[246:32.63]There's an item over here.
[246:51.36]Oh.
[246:54.39]Almost fooled you.
[247:05.94]That's it?
[247:06.68]That's all that was over here?
[247:07.62]Ooh, but there's a snack down there.
[247:09.72]Hold on.
[247:10.08]I'm gonna make this really stylish.
[247:16.62]Come on.
[247:18.40]Yeah!
[247:22.88]Nice.
[247:24.28]I shouldn't have done that.
[247:25.46]At least it looked cool, right?
[247:34.59]You're not gonna fool me.
[247:35.43]There's like three of them.
[247:37.67]We're gonna have to make this a little bit of an exit strategy.
[247:41.01]We're just gonna... Follow me down here.
[247:54.81]I thought I was close enough for a backstab.
[247:56.23]Maybe.
[247:56.61]We're good.
[248:07.86]I'd like some type of bonfire or something, though.
[248:15.73]Secret.
[248:16.61]No.
[248:18.43]Secret.
[248:19.37]No.
[248:19.67]Secret.
[248:20.85]Secret.
[248:27.57]Don't tempt me.
[248:29.04]Seriously, don't tempt me with this shit.
[248:33.24]I guess that's it.
[248:33.74]I could go back around and go down the stairs, right?
[248:40.06]Yeah, I'm not trying to jump.
[248:46.17]They're dead.
[248:46.59]They're not going to be like Super Mario where they come back to bone people, right?
[248:53.84]Oh, you didn't make the cut.
[248:57.27]That was a one roll, guys.
[248:58.39]That was a roll of a one.
[249:07.22]This is saying trap.
[249:10.36]I don't know what that means.
[249:11.48]Is there something going to fall from the sky?
[249:12.65]Are these boulders all going to crash down?
[249:14.07]I don't know.
[249:16.79]We're going to take this really slowly because I don't have any healing.
[249:19.07]I have a feeling there's probably a bonfire down here.
[249:27.52]so I hear something I hear something I do it comes back up the stairs it comes back up the stairs there's no law of physics that would make any sense for that to happen it comes back up the stairs
[249:56.38]You can't, you can't roll it up the stairs but it's just bowling, it's not a ball return.
[249:59.98]No.
[250:13.97]No.
[250:14.21]Hey, you know the laws of physics?
[250:22.17]Let's just pretend that those don't exist for one minute.
[250:28.20]Did somebody see... Okay, I'll tell you right now.
[250:30.83]If there ain't a fucking giant in that room that skee-balled it up that ramp, game sucks.
[250:38.03]Alright?
[250:40.06]You understand?
[250:41.28]If there's no giant in that room that skee-balled it up, game sucks.
[250:56.35]I don't want to lose those souls, so I'm not going to be dumb here.
[251:09.97]Good thing I saw that guy behind me.
[251:14.75]You're the most dangerous one out of all the people here right now.
[251:29.43]See, I got angry and I sprinted through this shit.
[251:34.38]Because a guy skee-balled a ball.
[251:38.00]I can't even talk.
[251:40.22]Because there's no reason why that should have... There's no reason.
[251:44.77]There's just no reason.
[251:50.01]Now we're down to four Estus flasks.
[251:57.94]Shit my fucking pants.
[252:08.11]No, I'm saving my embers.
[252:11.59]I want to save my embers for boss encounters.
[252:13.13]Because I'm going to have a pretty decent amount of health.
[252:17.71]I just get parried.
[252:19.35]By a guy that can't see.
[252:20.93]This dude doesn't even have a head.
[252:27.07]And he's good enough to be able to parry.
[252:28.80]Listen to me, son.
[252:32.80]I'm your dad.
[252:35.22]Destroy him!
[252:40.55]Deez Guardians.
[252:42.03]Fucking dude, thanks for subbing.
[252:58.49]We still have more souls when I get them back.
[253:01.58]Ha ha.
[253:01.94]No, that's because... Shit.
[253:11.09]Wow.
[253:11.87]Wow, guys.
[253:12.89]Wow!
[253:13.71]Freaking... Well, there go 7,000 souls.
[253:28.50]There they go.
[253:37.02]Wowee.
[253:51.60]I'm gonna make it.
[253:52.02]Now if I could- if I landed that, that would've been pretty cool.
[254:14.54]Worth a shot.
[254:21.40]No, I'm gonna have to slowly go through this because I don't want to waste any souls.
[254:24.75]Alright, spawn the guy behind me.
[254:33.19]Please do it again.
[254:33.73]There's skeletons.
[254:36.26]You suck in Killer Instinct, by the way.
[254:40.60]What are you, the worst character in Killer Instinct?
[254:42.36]That's what I thought.
[254:49.99]I don't want to be dodging around on the bridge.
[255:14.51]Don't anchor the Katamari bomb.
[255:35.46]There he is, there's the headless horseman.
[255:54.89]Aha, you missed!
[256:11.64]Alright, so where was... How come the other guy's not in here?
[256:16.63]Alright, well, whatever.
[256:22.85]I'm okay with just fighting one of you.
[256:23.97]I don't know where your friend went.
[256:25.39]He's down there.
[256:27.21]Let's keep him down there, please.
[256:43.52]I'm actually okay with this because I'm getting a lot of shards.
[256:45.95]A lot of them.
[256:52.13]Where is he?
[256:52.43]There he is.
[256:58.29]I wanted to run up.
[256:59.51]Oh, boy.
[257:00.33]Oh, fucking boy.
[257:22.65]Alright.
[257:23.65]Large Titanite?
[257:24.93]Nah, just a regular one.
[257:27.45]Alright, here comes Indiana Jones.
[257:30.37]So, let's see.
[257:31.43]Here it comes, right?
[257:33.84]Gotta, like, get halfway down.
[257:38.34]Ooh, it just landed on my head.
[257:39.44]It landed on my head.
[257:42.06]I need to watch this.
[257:46.06]Down.
[257:47.71]And it comes back up.
[258:00.45]Okay, so I need to be standing right here, and I'm gonna have to run right I think so Good
[258:22.37]Oh, I have to wait for it to come back and then go in again.
[258:25.82]This is terrifying.
[258:28.41]There's no lever.
[258:34.02]Oh, God, thank goodness.
[258:53.31]No backstab?
[258:54.41]No backstab?
[258:55.26]What?
[259:03.96]No backstab?
[259:04.46]What was the backstab?
[259:07.24]What was that purple shit?
[259:12.34]You guys see that?
[259:15.66]Where did you come from?
[259:26.34]Oh, that's the purple shit.
[259:27.38]Alright.
[259:40.65]What do we have here?
[259:43.51]Time for rolling.
[259:44.77]Okay.
[259:45.92]Don't tell me to roll.
[259:48.08]No, not time for rolling.
[259:49.76]Time to be very careful and sneak around.
[259:53.20]Rolling breaks open the urns and the spirits get angry with you.
[259:57.03]It's just a maze.
[259:58.05]If I can find the right way.
[260:01.61]Right?
[260:01.99]Well, let me just drink this.
[260:08.65]Okay.
[260:11.64]Holy shit!
[260:13.38]What have I done?
[260:27.45]There's so many traps and shit, but what does that ring do?
[260:29.59]I'm gonna milk ring.
[260:32.31]Slightly boost dexterity and obscures rolling.
[260:38.42]Wow, that's... Alright, dirt...
[260:41.76]What does that mean?
[260:43.28]Obscure is rolling?
[260:49.88]You turn invisible?
[260:58.09]I'm not sure I like that.
[261:00.41]I mean, am I invincible during that?
[261:08.89]Cool, but I don't know.
[261:11.65]I don't know.
[261:12.03]I mean, I'll take the three dexterity.
[261:17.40]That's pretty awesome.
[261:21.34]One problem I see with this is if you're fighting somebody, you, like, lose track of... I hate this place already.
[261:34.68]We are going to be a total wuss.
[261:36.80]We're going to be a coward here.
[261:51.43]Smashing these stupid things.
[262:02.41]These guys are throwing them.
[262:07.07]I'm just getting so tied up right now.
[262:11.94]Oh my god.
[262:12.82]I'm just too scared of the traps.
[262:27.19]I didn't know.
[262:27.83]I thought those two guys were sword guys.
[262:30.33]I didn't think they were.
[262:31.29]Oh, man.
[262:34.64]I don't like this place at all.
[262:40.32]This place sucks.
[262:44.01]I think I've said that a lot in this game.
[262:45.71]I think I've said this place sucks at least like four areas.
[263:01.68]You've got these hyper-aggressive enemies in those rooms.
[263:07.10]Why was he just not coming out of the ground?
[263:08.52]That was weird.
[263:18.87]I like how we both have the ring.
[263:20.41]Alright, hold on.
[263:22.68]I need to really slow it down here.
[263:42.25]I think I'm going to upgrade this weapon again.
[263:43.45]I think I have enough Titanite to do it.
[263:52.51]How far have I progressed?
[263:54.28]Six bosses in?
[263:55.76]Six and a half?
[263:56.40]Seven?
[263:56.74]I don't know.
[263:57.22]Whatever it is.
[263:59.86]Somebody in Trachea is keeping track somewhere.
[264:16.88]Hold on, here he comes.
[264:18.16]That's his horseman.
[264:20.96]I don't want to pull both of them.
[264:48.43]Where is he?
[264:49.39]What the fuck?
[265:04.70]Six and a half.
[265:05.56]Well, I'm counting the random gray guy that was on top of the tower.
[265:10.86]Was he, like, six or was he, like, six and a half?
[265:14.68]The, like, random demon that was up there.
[265:35.48]I'm getting a lot of these.
[265:37.32]That's good.
[265:39.00]Alright, here we go.
[265:39.60]Here comes Indiana Jones again.
[265:40.82]I wonder if I can just beat it.
[265:44.66]If I just run.
[265:46.46]Can I just beat it?
[265:48.70]I don't know.
[265:49.80]Or do I have to wait?
[265:50.40]I'm going to try to run.
[265:58.88]Yeah, you can beat it.
[266:04.33]Good thing you made it out.
[266:07.23]Dingus.
[266:13.82]Alright, urns make scary guys pop out purple and kill you.
[266:26.97]There's also scary guys that shoot scary magic.
[266:43.46]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[266:45.76]Here, this is the fire arrows.
[267:03.99]How do I activate it?
[267:04.75]Isn't there a button on the ground?
[267:05.85]Shit.
[267:12.32]You just... Huh?
[267:16.64]That guy disappeared out of nowhere.
[267:17.80]People like to do that in this game.
[267:36.57]It's a little bit further up.
[267:39.85]Yeah, it's the angry cotton candy poofs.
[267:45.04]Where is that guy?
[267:46.36]Is the big guy... This is just a terrible place to fight anyone.
[267:50.37]Is there a... Does that guy got a pirate hat on?
[267:52.59]Does that guy have a paper pirate hat on?
[267:55.79]Or is it a magician?
[267:58.65]Looks like a dickhead either way.
[268:04.82]I'm just gonna try and... Such an awful place to fight.
[268:09.04]Step on that, please.
[268:10.00]Okay.
[268:11.76]Okay.
[268:18.84]Tiny little corridor.
[268:19.86]Can I just get him?
[268:24.48]Yes, I can.
[268:27.02]Step on it and kill him, right?
[268:28.02]Didn't really work as planned.
[268:34.87]We are fighting.
[268:35.49]I'm playing with fire here.
[268:41.21]I should not be over here.
[268:47.89]One of us is going to accidentally step on that thing in the middle.
[268:50.57]And we're dead.
[268:51.17]I know there's at least one or two.
[269:05.25]There they go.
[269:13.41]Where's your friend?
[269:14.71]Where are your friends?
[269:19.55]Do you remember fridge emote?
[269:21.93]Oh boy.
[269:24.57]Why do I need a fridge emote?
[269:43.39]Keep him in the corner.
[269:47.26]Thank god I killed him when I did.
[269:55.42]Did I stagger him?
[269:57.32]Cool.
[270:10.71]He exploded.
[270:13.69]Try contraption.
[270:20.58]Swear to God, if a boulder comes down here.
[270:24.71]If I get hit with a boulder right now... What?
[270:28.69]Beware of what?
[270:29.35]Ember.
[270:38.21]Where does the hole even bring you?
[270:45.31]Wheel guys, okay.
[270:48.67]Whatever you say.
[270:59.53]Oh, no.
[271:02.64]Oh, no.
[271:05.94]No.
[271:09.78]No.
[271:10.38]I gotta get the item.
[271:13.50]I might try the other direction.
[271:22.52]It's over on the side there.
[271:25.22]Take a look.
[271:31.36]Oh, thank heavens.
[271:34.17]Thank heavens.
[271:39.09]Thank the stars.
[271:39.93]Thank the lucky stars.
[271:44.73]Can you kill the ball?
[271:45.53]I don't know.
[271:45.91]I'm not testing it.
[271:48.32]We'll do some testing.
[272:02.53]An emote of just my face?
[272:05.09]Hold on, you want an emote of just my face?
[272:06.81]There's like seven of those.
[272:09.07]They just happen to be on planets.
[272:13.40]How many do I need?
[272:13.94]Nine thousand.
[272:15.30]Seven, eight.
[272:32.71]I'll just do them all because I want to upgrade this thing again.
[272:46.80]Hello, lady.
[272:51.90]Endurance.
[272:53.50]Farewell, Ashen.
[273:01.82]I think I have enough Titanite shards to upgrade my funny thing again.
[273:06.08]I want to see what this one does.
[273:12.87]Raw gem, crystal gem, fire gem, blessed gem.
[273:17.87]Deep gem.
[273:20.63]Didn't I get a new one?
[273:21.33]I swear to God I got a new gem.
[273:28.72]That's a little bit better.
[273:35.03]Can do it again too.
[273:38.73]Yeah, I think this is going to be the thing I stick with for a while.
[273:42.29]For sure.
[273:43.30]I'm going to get this as high as I can.
[273:49.30]This thing is pretty great now.
[273:54.70]But I was under the assumption that I got a different one.
[274:04.41]And that's two upgrades.
[274:07.67]So this thing should be hurting a lot more.
[274:15.24]Sharp Gem.
[274:15.78]Infuse to create sharp weapon.
[274:24.43]How come I can't use this?
[274:25.26]I can't infuse this to make better dexterity scaling?
[274:26.98]I don't know.
[274:27.28]No one would imagine I could do that.
[274:28.14]Ah!
[274:54.56]I think I'm gonna buy some gold pine.
[275:00.22]Spend all my money, because I'm probably just gonna lose it.
[275:15.97]The voice actor for the blacksmith sounds like Hagrid from the PlayStation 1 Harry Potter games.
[275:21.43]That is oddly specific.
[275:32.16]Here we go.
[275:32.52]Nah, I missed.
[275:35.75]Come back here.
[275:53.16]I don't think you can attack it.
[275:56.45]Try one more time.
[276:13.29]Nope!
[276:14.75]You can't kill the ball... You can't kill the ball of people, unfortunately.
[276:31.46]Come on back.
[276:32.02]There has to be a way.
[276:39.12]I wish I could put a door stop in front of it.
[276:41.58]More rats?
[276:48.36]Are we going to have to fight Royal Rat Authority too?
[276:50.22]It goes all the way back there, doesn't it?
[276:59.73]Oh!
[277:02.69]This thing is... I love this thing at the moment.
[277:04.71]It's doing a ton of damage.
[277:05.73]Alright, are you a fake wall?
[277:08.98]No, unfortunately you're not.
[277:22.04]Is that all you're gonna do?
[277:25.32]That's not annoying or anything.
[277:31.44]Kukri!
[277:32.00]What is it?
[277:44.15]Huh?
[277:53.89]Is that like a throwable item?
[277:55.41]Or am I just crazy and done?
[277:56.81]Why do I not see it?
[278:03.82]Oh, okay.
[278:04.80]Throwing knife causes bleed.
[278:08.56]Whatever.
[278:16.86]Down to the depths we go.
[278:17.82]Jewel bug.
[278:28.87]He stuffed into the wall.
[278:29.67]He disappeared.
[278:30.11]He went into the wall.
[278:31.31]He fell through the Earth.
[278:33.63]I win.
[278:36.17]I still win.
[278:36.71]It's okay.
[278:49.05]We're going to forget about that technique.
[278:50.51]I'm just going to try to get around him and do the backstab.
[278:53.15]It seems to be the most effective.
[278:54.25]We'll just stun log him.
[278:55.45]Why parry the guys that can go invisible?
[278:57.67]I'm not sure.
[279:05.46]It's a lizard?
[279:06.46]Uh, excuse me.
[279:08.08]That is a jewel bug.
[279:16.10]Left or right?
[279:25.07]Bugs.
[279:27.17]Goddamn bugs.
[279:33.10]I'm definitely not safe in here.
[279:44.18]Come on.
[279:44.60]I know you're going to do that.
[279:47.56]It's going to happen again, too.
[279:54.73]Well, I missed an item back there.
[279:56.93]Oh, well.
[280:01.72]That's the way I came.
[280:11.45]It's a headless horseman guy.
[280:13.59]He's gonna get up and he's gonna walk across the bridge with me.
[280:17.23]I've already seen that coming from a mile away.
[280:29.23]I ain't taking the bridge.
[280:30.69]I can tell you that.
[280:32.55]For damn sure.
[280:37.51]Somebody tells me the bridge is gonna break.
[280:40.33]I ain't going over the bridge!
[280:43.75]Looks like a pretty much no-brainer.
[280:45.01]Oh, should I cut the rope?
[280:52.86]Come on.
[280:53.78]I want to cut the ceremonial bridge.
[280:55.22]I think this is a boss.
[281:06.35]A boss!
[281:07.43]Good luck!
[281:08.95]There's a boss back here.
[281:09.83]Hey, watch out.
[281:11.49]There's a boss over here.
[281:26.14]Where is there?
[281:36.96]Should I break all these before I fight the boss?
[281:38.90]I feel like I'm gonna roll into these and the stupid purple dudes are gonna come out.
[281:49.11]Well, I have no idea.
[281:53.17]Touch the goblet.
[281:55.55]How dare you touch my goblet!
[282:06.54]I always had to be a skeleton king.
[282:13.17]Is there a video game that exists that doesn't have the skeleton king in the game?
[282:36.53]Why am I here?
[282:38.83]I'm going this way.
[282:41.63]So it looks safer.
[282:49.22]Get transported.
[282:51.86]Was there like LSD in that thing?
[282:53.38]I just drank out of the king's goblet?
[282:57.30]Whatever.
[283:13.03]Can I walk on this?
[283:17.09]Feels like the ground is not, uh... ...necessarily stable here.
[283:22.25]Whoa!
[283:31.86]I'm dead!
[283:32.54]I'm already dead?!
[283:34.90]But he didn't do anything!
[283:37.28]What?
[283:41.06]Stupid!
[283:49.65]Oh, that was dumb.
[283:50.73]Boo, boo, boo, I scared you.
[283:55.01]By the way, you're instantly dead.
[284:03.98]Well, I'll give Dark Souls 3 credit.
[284:08.84]I'll give Dark Souls 3 credit.
[284:12.00]Skeleton King in every single game.
[284:14.14]That is true.
[284:15.72]Only they decided to make him huge.
[284:19.86]So he's way bigger than any of the other skeleton kings.
[284:23.25]This guy, I guess that's kind of cool.
[284:25.49]Cool he's a huge skeleton king.
[284:26.85]Is this guy still behind me?
[284:34.69]I feel like there might be another bonfire somewhere.
[284:36.99]Or maybe not.
[284:38.35]Maybe I just have to run.
[284:39.83]Well, hold on.
[284:41.22]Nope, okay.
[284:42.46]I didn't even see this before.
[284:45.10]Just to make sure I know where this is going.
[284:51.56]This is the rat area, again.
[284:56.54]Yeah, that's... It doesn't help very much.
[285:03.30]Just kind of gets you behind everybody.
[285:15.48]I'm just out of curiosity.
[285:17.02]I'm gonna go across the bridge.
[285:18.78]Let's go see what happens.
[285:20.58]You know, whatever.
[285:21.22]If I die, I die.
[285:23.16]I gotta say, at least I went across the bridge.
[285:28.20]The bridge is fine.
[285:28.76]There's nothing wrong with the bridge.
[285:36.46]My frames are dropping right now.
[285:37.80]Okay.
[285:42.96]So, I guess stay away from his hands.
[285:51.82]Let's see what he does.
[285:52.62]He crawls at you like a baby.
[285:59.13]And he... I feel like he's gonna do a swipe or something.
[286:09.61]No, he's just gonna keep crawling at me.
[286:13.73]I didn't hit him once?!
[286:15.31]Feistel!
[286:20.12]Nice of the sub, dude.
[286:23.46]I'll try my best to kill him.
[286:31.52]The whole place is going dark.
[286:35.23]What is that doing?
[286:36.13]What does that do?
[286:37.03]How do I get away?
[286:38.11]What?
[286:38.59]The whole area.
[286:40.69]What do you do?
[286:42.39]Is there a spot that's not that?
[286:47.43]Don't know.
[286:48.21]I'm just trying to learn how this guy works.
[286:50.31]If he does the throw-up, maybe I have to be, like, right underneath him?
[286:56.75]Where does it not do it?
[286:57.53]One of the sides?
[286:59.13]I guess.
[287:01.17]Yeah, okay.
[287:01.57]I'm just gonna run to the side.
[287:08.91]Work on his left hand, I guess.
[287:14.57]What the fuck hurt me?
[287:17.49]Did a blade of grass just cut my back?
[287:19.21]Keep it.
[287:26.25]Do it again.
[287:26.91]Do your slam move.
[287:33.38]Can I eventually break his arm off?
[287:37.08]Here comes the throw up.
[287:40.47]No.
[287:40.71]What is he doing?
[287:43.59]What the hell is he doing?
[287:47.59]You alright?
[287:48.01]There's a guy here.
[287:54.16]Oh, he summons skeletons.
[287:56.68]Okay.
[288:00.20]He summons the skeletons and kills them all.
[288:07.05]Oh boy.
[288:16.01]Oh my goodness.
[288:18.86]Alright.
[288:25.38]Alright.
[288:26.32]Cool.
[288:30.54]I'm fairly certain I need to do something else besides get caught in his sneeze and die.
[288:47.01]I don't think I can make it.
[288:47.89]I don't think I can make it.
[288:49.69]No, I couldn't make it.
[288:50.37]Whatever, we're on the track.
[288:53.82]I think I can make that if I'm really quick about it.
[289:00.68]So Blue missed his insta-death.
[289:02.72]I'm assuming I have to hit him in the head.
[289:03.80]Maybe he's weak to something.
[289:18.17]Before applying anything to a weapon, I'd like to know where I'm supposed to be attacking him.
[289:23.80]Probably in the face.
[289:26.48]I don't even care about those souls.
[289:27.76]They're gone forever.
[289:33.66]Can I get behind him?
[289:35.75]No, he has the death mist right behind him.
[289:37.73]Can I jump on his hand or something?
[289:50.06]I don't think so.
[289:52.36]I mean, his face... No, that's missed.
[290:03.29]I can't even hit him.
[290:19.65]Okay What else you got?
[290:33.28]I'm gonna assume it's his hands.
[290:34.66]I just have to like break his arms or something because he has like brittle bones, right?
[290:47.02]What is that?
[290:50.82]Oh, he has a sword?
[290:51.72]He's like not even hitting me with it.
[291:06.87]What did he just throw?
[291:10.79]Um... Look if you can kill your own enemies, that'd be great.
[291:18.87]Should I try to hit the sword?
[291:19.79]Can I blow the sword up in his hand?
[291:24.97]I'm kind of just getting comboed.
[291:26.19]Maybe hit him in the diamond rings?
[291:32.21]That's definitely what it is.
[291:34.80]Figured you out.
[291:35.40]I can hit you right in your cuffs.
[291:38.20]Eventually they explode and burn you.
[291:53.70]He just takes forever, maybe.
[292:00.55]Yep, I knew it!
[292:01.97]I knew it!
[292:03.03]I told you that's what you had to do.
[292:04.85]You're gonna break his Aladdin cuffs.
[292:13.64]Not so hard now, are you?
[292:23.79]Oh, would you look at that?
[292:28.21]Would you look at that?
[292:29.31]Where's he going?
[292:36.59]Where you going?
[292:38.69]What the fuck?
[292:49.08]Don't don't breathe in his like gas around him.
[292:56.49]Okay, well now I know.
[292:57.65]I'm gonna get the left one first.
[293:05.72]This is stupid.
[293:08.76]Oh god.
[293:09.52]This is dumb.
[293:16.92]Why are there so many dumb things in this game?
[293:21.31]Do you have to have the guy have choking gas?
[293:24.11]If you touch it, you're instantly dead.
[293:26.13]Do you have to put that in?
[293:27.45]He's already like a boss.
[293:29.78]Why does it have to be an out-of-bounds at this boss fight?
[293:35.50]Oh, sorry.
[293:36.10]You went out of bounds.
[293:40.40]You're about to leave the mission area.
[293:49.39]Going for the left hand first.
[293:50.83]That's his sword hand.
[293:51.71]There you stupid crawl.
[293:56.95]Where's his hand?
[294:04.36]Thought I dodged through it.
[294:05.14]Apparently not.
[294:09.84]I'm so scared to go over there.
[294:11.02]I'm like, I'm so self-conscious of the out of bounds on this boss that it's hard for me to even fight him.
[294:20.68]See, right now, his hand isn't out of bounds.
[294:22.74]Right?
[294:24.60]Yep.
[294:25.26]His hand's out of bounds.
[294:43.29]Put your hand down.
[294:47.03]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[294:49.54]Actually, I'm gonna wait.
[294:51.02]I'm not gonna rush it.
[294:51.76]Come here, you.
[295:04.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[295:09.11]Yeah!
[295:13.85]Shit, he's doing more out-of-bounds gas.
[295:21.92]Come on.
[295:28.36]One more!
[295:31.29]I'm topping myself off.
[295:37.59]What is he gonna do now?
[295:38.73]Yeah, he's gonna do the crawl.
[295:44.49]Alright, here comes a big swing.
[295:52.47]I want him to do it with the right hand plan.
[295:55.83]What is this?
[295:56.27]I don't remember this.
[295:58.45]Hmm.
[296:24.13]Don't get stuck on him.
[296:26.53]No, he's getting sword.
[296:28.29]No sword, buddy.
[296:29.13]Alright, he's dead.
[296:32.69]Fuck you.
[296:33.67]He's not dead.
[296:34.21]Is he dead?
[296:34.65]He's dead.
[296:37.39]Dumbass.
[296:41.77]Okay, that guy was... That guy was easy.
[296:48.86]Don't be phase one.
[297:03.31]Got him.
[297:05.99]I broke his favorite jewelry, so he dies.
[297:09.17]He's so inconsolable that you broke his golden bracelets that he jumps himself off the cliff.
[297:34.93]Okay, well.
[297:36.71]Let me walk in that door, I guess.
[297:41.86]How many souls was that worth?
[297:47.44]That seems like a lot of souls.
[297:50.51]For... Oh.
[297:54.71]Not that huge of a deal.
[297:55.89]Like, the last boss before him was way harder.
[297:58.03]Okay.
[298:00.46]That dude was like... I had to be in 100% locked in concentration mode.
[298:09.30]To kill the boss before him.
[298:13.86]Hold on a second.
[298:16.04]So, I came back to come this way, right?
[298:20.03]I progressed and I killed the Crystal Sage.
[298:22.99]And I decided I'm going to go back this way.
[298:26.27]I could technically go back past the Crystal Sage.
[298:31.47]Right?
[298:33.73]So, I don't know.
[298:34.89]Should I just keep going this way or should I go past where the crystal sage is?
[298:38.31]I guess that's the choice I have.
[298:39.49]Let's see what this boss soul does.
[298:55.46]That's the swamp.
[298:58.89]Well, that's swamp 1.0.
[299:02.01]I don't mind.
[299:02.85]Swamp 1.0 is not a big deal.
[299:04.44]Swamp 2.0, that actual swamp with the poison, is the worst thing in the world.
[299:11.08]Uh, so this is a pyromancy ore.
[299:19.82]Wolnir's Holy Sword.
[299:23.88]Skill, Wrath of the Gods.
[299:27.22]Do a shockwave.
[299:28.10]That's kind of cool.
[299:29.84]Alright, well, I'm going to take a break.
[299:32.60]I'll be right back.
[299:33.02]I'm going to take a pee.
[299:35.88]Get another drink.
[299:37.72]And I suggest if you'd like to take a small break, you do the same.
[299:40.06]And I shall return.
[299:42.40]I'll be right back.
[302:22.71]Hello Let's get back to it So I can just crush that soul I don't really care about that sword
[302:44.50]That guy gave so many souls for what he was worth.
[302:51.82]Can I have another cup?
[302:52.65]Yeah, I do.
[303:03.75]How are ya?
[303:08.98]Can do it three times.
[303:17.86]What happened to... Wait, hold on a second.
[303:23.66]Don't I have 30 dexterity?
[303:26.96]Is it not incorporated with... I guess it's just not incorporated when you're in the screen here.
[303:36.94]That ring gives me plus three.
[303:39.48]Let's do... I want to get 20 endurance.
[303:48.06]I think I'm just going to put them all in Endurance.
[303:50.11]I think that's a good call.
[303:51.47]Try to get that to 20.
[303:55.71]What does my Covenant do?
[303:58.29]If you should acquire a blessing of...
[304:18.47]I don't even know what this... I'm like the Wolfman.
[304:20.49]I don't know what it does.
[304:30.82]You have gained the power of the Wolfman.
[304:34.66]Good luck finding out what the hell that does.
[304:36.54]I'll buy some of this.
[304:47.90]You know, just give me an absolute... No.
[304:50.48]No, no, no.
[304:51.12]Five.
[304:53.12]We'll go five.
[304:55.77]Two.
[304:58.29]I want to be able to need the... Once those things are usable, I want to use them, you know?
[305:05.60]Two more.
[305:15.57]I remember I played Bloodborne and I was doing Arcane and I was using the torch as a weapon for the first like three hours of the game.
[305:26.62]Four hours of the game.
[305:27.62]It's kind of funny.
[305:37.39]I'll just keep going.
[305:49.21]You haven't seen very many sorcerers.
[305:53.46]Yeah, I feel like a lot of people are doing their first playthroughs of the game.
[305:58.68]And that's a scary thing to attempt to do first.
[306:03.56]So when you get a little bit more comfortable and you understand like where the spells are and...
[306:08.32]knowing that you can actually do it, it's a viable strategy rather than have to essentially restart the whole game because you're just gimping yourself.
[306:15.41]I think you'll see way more people do their second playthroughs with like bows and arrows and pyromancies and... Now this is what I'm talking about.
[306:25.64]This place is beautiful.
[306:26.76]This is exactly the kind of shit I want to see.
[306:29.86]No more poison swamps.
[306:31.52]No more dark castles.
[306:34.20]Show me Hogwarts.
[306:36.20]Let me see Hogwarts.
[306:38.20]That's what I'm talking about.
[306:39.04]It only took like 10 hours into the game.
[306:55.28]Come on, that's gotta be a false wall, right?
[307:14.74]It's so funny, you know when you see like three of these and a bunch of blood, there's a guy that's gonna insta-kill me over here.
[307:21.83]Where is he?
[307:22.23]I don't know.
[307:29.59]He probably lands on the bridge.
[307:31.69]Incoming dragon that's gonna jump on the bridge.
[307:35.08]Here he comes, he's gonna jump on the bridge.
[307:38.91]There he is.
[307:39.57]Here he is.
[307:40.39]Behind me.
[307:41.31]I knew it.
[307:42.05]I knew he was behind me.
[307:43.51]Got you guys.
[307:44.05]Haha.
[307:44.27]That's a cool enemy.
[307:53.84]Shit.
[307:54.28]I'm kind of getting off pace here.
[307:55.42]I'm getting really off pace.
[307:59.86]Okay.
[308:00.70]I'm going to have to dodge one of these and then heal.
[308:04.12]There we go.
[308:13.75]This is like too big to be on this bridge Huge guy on bridge Where you have like three feet around him to move around and when he jumps over you if you're locked on your camera freaks the fuck out it just spins I
[308:40.59]Because we have to have you fight a giant guy on a narrow bridge.
[308:43.89]It wouldn't be a video game if there wasn't a huge guy.
[308:48.83]Come on, huge guy on tiny... Go, go, nice.
[308:51.38]Good job.
[308:51.98]You thought you were going to sneak up on me this time.
[308:54.42]You're not.
[308:55.04]So, do your dumb little thing.
[309:23.30]I'm gonna hit him right in his toe.
[309:27.58]Shit.
[309:30.93]God damn it.
[309:38.67]Where am I?
[309:39.29]I'm in his mouth?
[309:46.31]Why don't you follow me down here?
[309:47.45]I don't think you're gonna get stuck up there.
[309:51.83]I just drank like four.
[309:55.87]What?
[309:56.85]Really?
[309:57.09]Come on.
[309:58.51]He better not be at full health.
[310:05.18]No, he's gone.
[310:22.45]What is that?
[310:29.15]Pontiff's right eye?
[310:39.34]Boost attack as long as attacking persists.
[310:44.94]Okay.
[310:45.86]I'll put that on.
[310:52.30]So I get the more I consecutively hit people, I guess?
[310:58.97]Sure thing.
[311:01.95]Kill 20 more of those guys in packs of three.
[311:04.57]Oy vey.
[311:07.45]That's not something I want to do.
[311:15.28]What is... Cross barrier.
[311:23.69]Those who do not hold the doll cannot pass.
[311:26.35]Okay.
[311:37.84]I don't have a doll.
[311:39.56]I gotta get a doll.
[311:46.02]I guess I could go back.
[311:47.06]I'm gonna have to go towards the crystal sage.
[311:49.34]Past the crystal sage like I did before.
[311:55.41]Yeah, yeah, he's dead.
[311:56.23]Am I a muggle?
[311:59.13]I don't have the seal of the wizard.
[312:02.52]That's not cool.
[312:03.40]What a tease.
[312:05.04]This place looks so cool.
[312:06.36]I'm just a muggle, guys.
[312:14.94]So... Where?
[312:18.30]Crystal Sage.
[312:21.18]Cathedral of the Deep.
[312:24.13]Where was the next area past here?
[312:28.01]It was down here, right?
[312:33.17]I just have to keep progressing past Crystal Sage.
[312:44.76]Around the corner.
[312:51.94]There was another bonfire here though, wasn't there?
[312:59.20]Bug.
[313:06.39]Nice.
[313:09.01]How do I get out of this place now?
[313:13.98]That was easy.
[313:21.60]Where's the other bonfire?
[313:26.73]There's another bonfire.
[313:28.81]I ran by these guys.
[313:30.17]There's another bonfire down here.
[313:40.84]How big is this game in terms of file size?
[313:44.04]I think it's fairly large.
[313:45.50]Maybe like 20 gigs, maybe?
[313:48.38]18 gigs?
[313:51.02]From what I can remember.
[313:51.88]I remember getting up here and I think I said a long time ago.
[313:58.40]I'm not doing this right now.
[314:00.37]I hate... Yeah, okay.
[314:00.97]I remember.
[314:01.29]It was the very beginning of the stream.
[314:02.71]I was like, this is dumb.
[314:04.19]I hate this.
[314:06.51]And I left.
[314:07.15]I'd like to lock on to the dog that's right here.
[314:13.20]Or did he jump down to his death?
[314:16.12]I don't know.
[314:28.01]I'm not sure what it is.
[314:29.42]There's something infuriating about getting archers shooting at you like this.
[314:36.94]It's just boiling my blood, these archers.
[314:39.56]And it's not even a big deal.
[314:40.93]I fucking hate them.
[314:42.49]I hate these guys.
[314:44.39]Just like the... It's infuriating me.
[314:50.61]More than anything.
[314:51.55]I hate these people.
[314:52.60]I hate them.
[315:02.11]This is why I turned around.
[315:03.03]Because of this, like, terrible pull.
[315:06.02]These things remind me of the werewolves in Bloodborne.
[315:19.10]Those things were... Like, every time you'd run into one of those werewolves...
[315:25.99]But that's just a regular dog.
[315:27.59]Should they be that annoying?
[315:39.05]Jerma dislikes snipers.
[315:40.21]I hate Widowmakers, too.
[315:42.01]It is.
[315:42.67]It's definitely a sniper thing.
[315:43.91]It's definitely like I'm all the way back here just spamming arrows at you.
[315:47.79]It angers me.
[315:48.81]Oh, I forgot about the exploding dudes.
[315:56.49]I forgot they did that.
[315:57.17]Let's go to the front door.
[316:17.38]What about on this side?
[316:23.16]Nope.
[316:24.16]Okay.
[316:30.83]Remember, I get a doll from you.
[316:37.34]I have to do this.
[316:37.94]This is the most satisfying part of the whole game.
[316:48.30]Breaking the auditorium chairs.
[316:57.54]Have you ever been so mad that you lit yourself on fire and charged at someone?
[317:01.04]No, I don't think I've ever been that upset.
[317:09.41]Two doors?
[317:11.35]That's the skip.
[317:13.13]I would imagine.
[317:14.04]A whip.
[317:22.08]Cool.
[317:23.62]Another door that won't open.
[317:27.69]So... Uh... Okay.
[317:34.27]I can't go in here.
[317:36.15]Do I have to wrap around the whole place?
[317:42.40]Is there another door I could go in?
[317:47.02]Does not open from this side.
[317:48.14]Does not open from there.
[317:48.98]Okay.
[317:49.36]Looks like I can wrap around here.
[317:50.57]Is there somebody in the well?
[317:52.77]Okay.
[317:59.28]Remember, these guys all lit themselves on fire.
[318:01.81]I'm going to avoid them.
[318:07.93]I'm going to go up first.
[318:18.38]I remember this area.
[318:20.74]I remember this area.
[318:21.68]We're going to go the other way.
[318:23.04]This place absolutely scared me.
[318:25.21]Absolutely.
[318:27.90]I feel like I can get in the cathedral from down here.
[318:31.72]Maybe.
[318:42.95]No more swamps.
[318:45.63]No more swamps.
[318:46.41]I don't want any more swamps.
[318:49.68]I don't want any more swamp monsters.
[319:00.49]No swamps.
[319:11.78]Anything up here?
[319:12.66]Let's just go in the cathedral.
[319:16.40]I thought that was an enemy.
[319:21.14]I was about to be scared.
[319:24.56]Shit.
[319:27.68]Um...
[319:42.07]Dammit.
[319:53.39]Crystal people.
[319:56.22]What is that?
[319:57.38]There's a bug over there too.
[320:02.76]I don't want to engage this thing.
[320:03.86]I don't know what it is.
[320:04.42]I'm going to go get the bug.
[320:14.13]I'm not even sure I should fight this, whatever it is.
[320:24.20]He has thorns!
[320:25.26]Look at this big crystal beard!
[320:43.85]Titanite scale.
[320:47.35]It was way more intimidating.
[320:48.97]It's cool looking, though.
[321:00.12]I'm gonna need to roll.
[321:00.88]Just walk right through them.
[321:01.84]They're that delicate.
[321:13.13]Oh, door number one.
[321:14.91]No.
[321:18.99]We press on.
[321:24.43]Straight or up to the left?
[321:26.23]We'll try straight.
[321:32.57]Why are these walls all duds?
[321:33.95]A lot of duds.
[321:52.28]Okay, I think this is where I wrapped around.
[321:53.68]No, it's not.
[321:58.02]How much more damage am I getting from the consecutive swings?
[322:13.99]Can't really tell.
[322:19.46]Saint Tree Belvine.
[322:22.95]I'm bleeding.
[322:25.89]Stop the blood.
[322:26.61]There's more to go over here.
[322:35.22]Whoa.
[322:39.07]Okay.
[322:41.95]Is this serving some type of purpose?
[322:44.13]I don't know what it is, though.
[322:46.11]No, that's what I dropped right there.
[322:47.35]Alright.
[322:49.40]I got some other things.
[322:50.78]I got some more... You know.
[322:55.76]I got some more of the French champagne.
[322:59.47]Good to go.
[323:06.65]Can I put some gauze on me to stop this bleeding?
[323:13.97]I have one of those things, but it's too nonchalant to use it.
[323:21.57]Let me in the castle now, please.
[323:23.65]So whatever the next boss is, I'm going to give it a couple attempts.
[323:34.58]And then I'm going to end the stream.
[323:37.80]And I'm really enjoying playing through this game and streaming and everything.
[323:42.08]But I have a video that I have to finish.
[323:45.58]And if I don't stream... No, sorry.
[323:48.20]If I don't do the video, then I stream.
[323:50.08]If I stream, I don't do the video.
[323:51.14]But I want to stream this game.
[323:52.75]I want to play Dark Souls 3.
[323:53.95]What the hell do I do?
[323:58.99]Should I make the video?
[324:00.27]But I want to play.
[324:24.09]Alright, there's the door.
[324:27.06]So theoretically, this should be a way for me to go up there.
[324:34.64]In theory, but in practice, it doesn't look like I can go that way.
[324:44.34]Oh, we're going this way.
[325:02.01]Poison bite ring.
[325:07.29]What is all over me?
[325:10.63]Ah!
[325:12.31]Oh, there's bugs all over me!
[325:16.28]How do I get these bugs off?
[325:24.00]Oh, God.
[325:24.76]Get the bugs off me.
[325:29.80]Oh, that's bleed.
[325:35.11]That's disgusting.
[325:35.93]Alright, so where... This is not the correct room.
[325:48.72]I find that hard to believe.
[325:49.64]Let's take a look at the ring it is.
[325:55.16]What's the ring?
[326:01.63]Increases poison resistance.
[326:05.81]I think we're out of poison land for good, I hope.
[326:21.74]Where am I supposed to go here?
[326:24.99]I need to get, like, up there.
[326:39.72]In here is just that room again.
[326:41.53]Is it?
[326:45.45]Maybe not.
[326:46.29]What room is this?
[326:46.85]Yeah, this is back at the beginning.
[327:11.05]Who locks these doors?
[327:17.64]I guess I have to go around somewhere.
[327:27.98]Can I go to the other side?
[327:29.06]No.
[327:35.12]There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there.
[327:39.43]I wonder if I can wrap around here.
[327:46.21]We're just going for progress here.
[327:49.73]I'm not stopping to fight these dudes.
[327:51.91]I just want to see if I end up in a different spot.
[328:00.91]Alright, goodbye.
[328:06.01]Got that guy.
[328:19.05]Okay, maybe.
[328:28.09]Looks like I can go this way.
[328:30.73]Alright.
[328:32.12]I remember this.
[328:32.74]I remember this person.
[328:36.06]This weird hunter.
[328:46.30]Holy...
[329:01.33]Not gonna deal with you right now.
[329:10.91]You can stuff it.
[329:30.44]I wonder what the time frame is for a consecutive attack.
[329:33.50]Is it like a half second, quarter second?
[329:35.08]I wonder.
[329:37.40]That I do not know.
[329:38.10]I did a lot of damage.
[329:56.97]Fortunately, the backstab on this weapon does not really do a whole lot.
[330:00.66]It's really only, like, barely times two.
[330:03.00]Where's he throwing it from?
[330:18.62]Risky.
[330:19.68]Risky.
[330:21.70]Ooh, but it was worth it.
[330:22.54]That was worth it.
[330:32.21]Did I get all the items?
[330:35.59]I believe so.
[330:42.51]Quakey!
[330:43.07]Welcome, Quakey.
[330:58.90]A game almost just crashed.
[331:00.90]Jeez.
[331:02.65]Welcome to the team.
[331:03.79]Welcome to the group.
[331:07.81]This chest is going to hurt me.
[331:16.81]What is that thing?
[331:18.80]Cursed ward?
[331:25.96]That's a great shield.
[331:29.67]What else is down here?
[331:34.62]Oh, wait.
[331:35.28]I smell... I smell... the opening of a door?
[331:48.28]Oh, this room makes more sense now.
[331:49.52]Okay.
[331:51.64]Wrap around and come over here.
[331:52.40]I don't have to go through that nonsense again.
[332:06.34]82 deaths?
[332:06.80]Damn, noob.
[332:10.74]I'm still sub 100.
[332:15.71]I'm happy with sub 100.
[332:17.77]At the moment.
[332:18.19]I do have a lot of... I do have a lot of money.
[332:26.66]I'm just gonna call it money from now on.
[332:43.06]Red bug pellet.
[332:45.70]Couple of dudes.
[332:47.66]You're gonna stand up.
[332:48.58]I fucking hate you.
[332:53.31]I hate you.
[332:53.81]I...
[333:12.91]You're still alive, what a waste.
[333:15.07]I hate that guy.
[333:17.03]God, I hate that fucking Bob Barker.
[333:20.55]Happy Guild War.
[333:27.39]Um... Hi there!
[333:36.69]Nice try.
[333:43.30]Is that an item?
[333:44.76]No.
[334:06.38]That's not cool.
[334:07.68]You shouldn't have been over there.
[334:17.72]Like these cartwheels?
[334:32.91]Excuse me!
[334:35.53]Really low, like, excuse me.
[334:40.64]That guy's still shooting at me.
[334:41.66]There's two people shooting at me.
[334:45.32]All the way down there.
[334:49.60]All the way at the bottom.
[334:50.78]What else is down there with you guys?
[334:58.89]There's just a ton of you shooting arrows.
[335:02.11]Hmm...
[335:19.47]He's probably not even dead.
[335:20.40]Yeah, he is.
[335:24.76]Still okay on health.
[335:27.40]Well, I'm not necessarily sure where I'm going over here.
[335:33.92]Oh, be wary.
[335:35.36]Oh, thanks for the tip.
[335:36.32]I see his foot.
[335:46.37]Consecutive.
[335:48.68]I'm getting a lot of these bug pellets.
[335:55.91]Ah!
[335:56.09]Did you notice in the top left?
[335:59.05]Watch the top left.
[336:02.55]Hold on.
[336:03.75]Wedged in!
[336:04.25]Wedged in!
[336:06.15]They were screaming!
[336:08.51]What is happening in that room?
[336:11.67]What's going on?
[336:12.16]I can't drink!
[336:15.58]What is happening right now?
[336:19.28]Why can I not drink my Estus Flask?
[336:21.06]I'm like cursed.
[336:25.35]Who shut off my Estus Flask?
[336:31.96]That's the first time I've seen that happen.
[336:48.56]Crimea River.
[336:55.12]That was a song by Jason Timberlake.
[337:06.85]Dangerous, maybe?
[337:07.73]Fall?
[337:11.11]It's a little too dangerous for me.
[337:12.91]I'm just going to go back around.
[337:22.75]Oh, sorry.
[337:23.67]George Timberlake.
[337:24.74]Sorry about that.
[337:30.24]Where is he?
[337:38.74]Forget it.
[337:39.12]I'm not supposed to be backstab guy.
[337:42.06]I'm supposed to be consecutive hit guy.
[337:48.38]Don't ever forget it.
[338:06.15]Is somebody else here?
[338:07.89]I'm hearing swings.
[338:16.00]I'm this far.
[338:16.82]I don't want to screw it up.
[338:33.52]You had a great sword, but you're very dead.
[338:36.90]Hold on.
[338:38.58]Oh my god.
[338:40.76]I'm crawling off the walls.
[338:47.60]What's the tip?
[338:48.65]I'll be wary of left.
[338:49.93]Go to tip.
[338:50.93]Back to the tip.
[339:00.65]Remember guys, always read the tips.
[339:01.65]They're there for a reason.
[339:04.88]Tips.
[339:12.51]Okay, I just had to step back for a second.
[339:14.57]I had to pull myself out of my chair.
[339:16.47]The walls are moving.
[339:21.04]For a second, I was about to adjust my glasses.
[339:28.62]Oh, tip.
[339:29.58]Beware of pincers.
[339:30.40]Oh, good tip.
[339:31.55]Thank you.
[339:47.56]Got to be getting close to something.
[339:51.30]Something, that is.
[339:59.96]Be wary.
[340:04.36]Should I play in the sandcastle?
[340:07.55]That's probably not a good idea.
[340:17.68]I played it.
[340:23.37]Those guys are the floating ones.
[340:30.15]Give me a heart attack.
[340:40.86]The door.
[340:52.67]For a 14 minute gameplay tip forgot about those those are important these guys are all gonna blow up Wow
[341:20.79]Excuse me.
[341:21.69]They're just hacking away.
[341:36.44]Slow down.
[341:43.70]Safe to get the item, I hope.
[341:54.11]Not really that worth it, but whatever.
[342:01.34]One of these, a fake one?
[342:02.44]No, it can't be one of these ones.
[342:03.54]Right here?
[342:03.88]I hope this isn't a boss.
[342:14.67]Because I'm not necessarily prepared.
[342:16.85]I think, yeah, it is.
[342:18.19]Don't go in.
[342:20.05]Don't go in.
[342:20.53]Don't go in!
[342:23.09]Do not go in here.
[342:26.55]Or is it?
[342:29.05]I can't tell.
[342:30.83]Is this a cathedral?
[342:31.75]Can I open a door?
[342:32.42]I'm not comfortable going in here yet.
[342:39.06]I want to make sure there's no shortcut or bonfire I missed or something to get back here easy.
[342:46.52]Because I didn't open any of the cathedral doors.
[342:48.28]I feel like that's very important.
[342:58.10]Around this way.
[343:13.01]Shit.
[343:22.36]Shit.
[343:31.83]No other place to go.
[343:47.61]Champion must be going to message him on Skype.
[343:50.63]I will.
[343:53.17]But not right now.
[343:54.07]I'm currently playing Dark Souls.
[344:11.24]Really don't want to go in that room.
[344:14.74]And have it just be... Shit, I didn't open the doors.
[344:20.10]For the skip.
[344:21.28]I didn't get it and I have to run all the way back.
[344:23.00]This is a very... This is a ton of shit to run through.
[344:26.14]There's a lot of enemies here.
[344:29.76]So... Whoa!
[344:35.58]I... You're... I guess I didn't come this way.
[344:38.68]Thank you for reminding me that I was not over here.
[344:44.21]At least that way.
[344:50.38]Maybe I was.
[344:51.66]Yeah, I was.
[344:52.68]There's another entrance.
[345:18.56]Huh.
[345:22.26]Maybe that is the skip and I just have to kind of maneuver around it.
[345:25.04]Well, we're going to have to take our beating if that's the way to go.
[345:41.44]I hope.
[345:42.08]I hope it's the right way.
[345:50.96]Because this brings us down where I kicked the ladder down, right?
[345:55.25]Yeah.
[345:56.07]So I guess I'll try it.
[346:03.40]I don't know.
[346:04.00]I just want to open those doors in the beginning.
[346:08.52]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[346:13.30]Ordu.
[346:15.41]Welcome back, Ordu.
[346:16.83]Thanks for...
[346:19.54]Thanks for the five bucks.
[346:26.34]You are a saint.
[346:29.82]How about down there?
[346:30.48]Is there a safe place where I can drop down there?
[346:34.12]I'm not sure it's worth the risk.
[346:42.67]Oh, I almost just fell anyways.
[347:00.56]From down here nothing I can latch on to or drop down on That looks like a door It's like that's a door.
[347:11.67]That's a door guys.
[347:13.73]That's another door Those are doors Right those are doors
[347:32.32]Those are doors.
[347:43.33]Nothing I can do there.
[347:44.27]I'm just going to walk in the door.
[347:47.39]Turns out it was a mistake.
[347:51.39]It's a boss.
[347:53.12]Then I pay the penalty, don't I?
[348:01.37]I would pay the penalty.
[348:05.34]The ultimate price.
[348:17.60]Go in the scary boss door.
[348:18.96]That's what I'm gonna do.
[348:19.94]As much as I don't want to, that's what I'm gonna do.
[348:26.54]The huge cathedral area.
[348:29.68]I wonder if you fight guy here, but I have a very bad skip.
[348:34.09]That's a very annoying way to get back here.
[348:39.09]One more check.
[348:40.05]I just want to check one more time that there's nothing over here.
[348:46.71]You can never be too careful.
[348:52.02]No.
[348:53.12]Alright.
[348:54.18]Cross your fingers.
[348:54.74]Say your prayers.
[348:56.90]Hope this is not the boss arena.
[349:01.56]That's a big boss.
[349:02.94]Look at this guy.
[349:05.01]This is a boss right now.
[349:05.89]I'm about to fight a boss.
[349:07.73]Oh, shit.
[349:08.35]Hold on.
[349:08.85]Don't move.
[349:10.29]What is that?
[349:12.57]What is this?
[349:12.93]A slug?
[349:17.36]Oh, wait a minute.
[349:18.88]It's the black goo that's in every Souls game.
[349:20.92]I forgot about this stuff.
[349:37.40]I hope I can just turn this corner.
[349:39.30]There's a door.
[349:41.66]Give me the door.
[349:44.55]Trap ahead.
[350:08.85]So, wait a minute.
[350:09.53]Can I... Should I talk to the... I'm so scared.
[350:14.63]I have so many souls and I don't know what is what and where is where.
[350:19.19]But there's a giant guy here.
[350:20.49]I'm going to wait until they get in and just spam them.
[350:39.32]What's that noise?
[350:45.88]This looks like I'm going through the cathedral.
[350:47.70]Who's the big dude?
[350:51.03]I don't know.
[351:00.37]Whoo!
[351:16.13]I guess I'm gonna go this way.
[351:27.54]Itching my head.
[351:29.88]Now this would be really grand if I could open a door.
[351:32.64]I can open a door.
[351:40.13]Where is that?
[351:41.99]I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[351:45.85]Apparently killed a good over here.
[351:47.36]Who did I kill?
[351:47.94]When did I kill that guy?
[351:48.86]I need to backtrack and see where this is This is another door That's the yeah
[352:17.75]Thank goodness.
[352:19.61]Thank goodness.
[352:22.84]Oh, thank heaven.
[352:37.82]I like this area.
[352:38.48]Remember I said I hated this area?
[352:40.90]I like this area.
[352:51.43]Praise the door.
[352:53.23]Let's go level up.
[353:06.22]Beep.
[353:08.94]Very well.
[353:12.53]Can do two levels.
[353:22.49]Durance to 20.
[353:22.97]And we'll get Dexterity.
[353:27.05]Yeah.
[353:30.69]Do I have enough Titanite to upgrade my rotten sword?
[353:32.43]No, I don't.
[353:32.67]Shit.
[353:32.87]Okay.
[353:54.76]I'm going to sell some junk to you.
[354:01.62]I do want to hold on to this still, though.
[354:05.69]Whip.
[354:06.99]It's a bleeding whip.
[354:08.67]PvP.
[354:11.83]Only 100 for a +2 greatscythe.
[354:16.47]Don't worry, guys.
[354:17.20]We'll totally get the BAE mode.
[354:18.56]He definitely didn't waste four slots on the terrible Jupiter joke.
[354:25.09]You save waste for slots.
[354:28.59]I'm not sure it was much of a waste.
[354:33.13]Uh, these things are gone.
[354:33.91]I'm never gonna use these.
[354:35.08]Uh, that's great.
[354:42.32]This is a great side.
[354:43.26]I don't want you to just get out of here.
[354:46.91]You were cool for about four hours.
[354:58.48]Fire damage absorption, lightning damage absorption.
[355:01.18]I have a lot of good resins.
[355:06.93]I'm going to get some more gold pine though.
[355:16.51]Well, you're out of gold pine.
[355:20.23]You're not out of fire.
[355:27.41]And give me some other stuff too.
[355:29.55]Give me a couple of these.
[355:37.63]See ya.
[355:38.35]Let's keep going.
[355:56.89]You know, you guys make jokes about the Jupiter emote.
[356:00.31]Something you don't know.
[356:01.05]Because I was thinking, at some point, to have just one gigantic emote.
[356:07.64]Use all ten slots.
[356:10.66]And have it just be only Jupiter.
[356:13.22]See, you don't like Jupiter, you make the joke that Jupiter sucks.
[356:16.50]Be careful.
[356:18.38]I might redo Jupiter and have it be all ten emotes.
[356:22.24]Be careful what you wish for.
[356:24.18]Even though nobody wished for it.
[356:26.01]In fact, everyone said they didn't want that.
[356:28.27]Careful what you wish for.
[356:28.97]Oh, jeez.
[356:42.35]Yeah, that's never gonna happen.
[356:53.28]Now I'm not so scared.
[356:56.07]I'm going to just peek out here and take a look.
[357:02.88]Without a doubt in my mind, you are the next boss.
[357:11.48]He's breaking stuff.
[357:12.84]He's not happy.
[357:17.01]He's not happy.
[357:19.29]Am I on the ground still?
[357:25.33]Oh, I just got a new ring.
[357:30.82]Exploding bolt.
[357:31.98]Cool.
[357:40.86]Wow.
[357:41.98]That was cool.
[357:44.38]That was a ride.
[357:50.20]What's in here?
[357:54.28]There's even more to this place.
[357:55.54]Alright, remember that that ladder exists.
[357:57.94]Because I will forget it.
[358:00.78]I can see him.
[358:02.88]Yeah, drop down.
[358:13.91]Thanks a lot, Howdy Doody.
[358:15.69]You got a great name, by the way.
[358:18.59]Howdy Doody.
[358:28.14]The consecutive hits does pretty quick work at these.
[358:32.96]Seek guidance.
[358:34.06]I'm getting a lot of spells, but I don't really know what to do with them or care.
[358:43.53]Ah!
[358:49.11]Was there before.
[358:57.97]There's two ways to go.
[358:59.05]I could keep going down.
[359:14.04]Ooh, a chest.
[359:15.02]Be careful.
[359:16.12]Chest is gonna get you.
[359:17.54]Be wary.
[359:19.56]Ha ha ha!
[359:19.88]Ha ha ha!
[359:40.15]Got ya.
[359:43.01]Be wary of trap.
[359:46.78]I should put a note down.
[359:47.72]Yeah, there's like four notes.
[359:48.90]I gotta put a note down here.
[360:02.40]Be wary.
[360:04.44]Make sure every single person talks about it at the chest.
[360:07.88]Listen to me, son.
[360:10.36]I'm your dad.
[360:12.80]Destroy him!
[360:17.40]Whoa!
[360:19.32]Hello, Zishpi.
[360:22.12]Thanks for subbing.
[360:22.66]Welcome, dude.
[360:23.58]Welcome, dude.
[360:24.59]Hey, man.
[360:25.09]Thanks for subbing.
[360:27.19]Welcome.
[360:29.07]Hey, that's a nice mace you got there.
[360:31.61]Get insta parried.
[360:39.71]I can't parry.
[360:40.36]Oh, he drained all my stamina.
[360:43.90]Is somebody else shooting me?
[360:51.90]No, it's pulsating.
[361:05.34]Trying to backstab him, but that ain't working out, is it?
[361:14.04]Am I gonna get his hammer?
[361:19.97]Apparently not.
[361:20.71]Nope.
[361:30.95]Interesting room.
[361:37.80]Whoa, my spider wolf.
[361:54.78]Shit.
[361:55.92]What am I doing?
[362:01.92]What?
[362:02.12]Ugh.
[362:06.43]I should have just hammered the fuck out of him.
[362:08.63]I don't know what the hell I was doing there.
[362:10.16]I could have just consecutively hit him.
[362:13.12]I didn't know.
[362:15.02]Forgot about that stupid dumb shit in this game.
[362:17.66]What if a bar fills up?
[362:23.86]Watch out for that bar, because if it fills up, you just die.
[362:28.19]What was it?
[362:35.33]Curse?
[362:41.71]I don't know.
[362:42.15]Whatever.
[362:42.37]I don't give a shit.
[362:59.62]I didn't go down here.
[363:00.38]Let's take a look-see.
[363:24.57]I guess it's just a deep gem.
[363:26.85]That's it.
[363:31.73]Well, worth getting.
[363:36.82]Yeah, you're right.
[363:37.24]That's a good point.
[363:39.40]My best hat.
[363:40.00]That is a good point.
[363:40.58]Don't drive angry.
[363:43.00]You can't be so... Where am I?
[363:46.19]Is there an enemy on me?
[363:48.95]Is there black goo on me?
[363:51.91]Alright.
[363:53.42]Just get consecutive.
[364:03.32]Gotta run by the giant again.
[364:04.59]Excuse me.
[364:14.91]Excuse me for dropping in.
[364:20.56]Hate you.
[364:21.30]Hate you up there.
[364:22.38]Hate you.
[364:31.29]This is the chest room.
[364:34.89]Alright, let's go.
[364:36.63]I'm doing this again.
[364:39.09]This time.
[364:44.25]You're back!
[364:46.89]Somebody's behind me.
[364:48.45]Two jesters!
[364:51.47]Come back this way...
[365:00.54]Where am I, where am I, where am I?
[365:09.48]Shit.
[365:20.85]Yeah, I wish you won't.
[365:21.81]You know, I wish you won't.
[365:24.55]I wish you won't.
[365:30.23]In what world are you faster than the Jester?
[365:40.74]God, they're just always standing right next to each other.
[365:45.50]Do you have to both be in here at the same fucking time?
[366:05.29]That was a dumb idea.
[366:06.05]I got a shield.
[366:09.13]Okay, now I'm trying not to get cursed.
[366:18.80]Where did I go to?
[366:19.28]Where do you go to school to be a Jermologist?
[366:21.66]Oh, to go to... You gotta go to school of germology.
[366:45.44]I'm just going to let that fall back.
[366:46.88]I don't want that to fill.
[366:50.26]Even if it gets me with one more hit.
[366:55.89]And here we go again.
[366:57.53]Wow.
[366:58.25]Good thing I didn't go in.
[367:09.20]Okay.
[367:09.64]Got him.
[367:09.86]Actually, I have a couple of rings to look at right now.
[367:18.90]Boost attack when HP is full.
[367:22.97]That's never gonna happen.
[367:24.07]I'm always not at fully health.
[367:26.99]Recovers FP from criticals.
[367:37.63]Somebody asked about you.
[367:38.40]You gotta go to a school of Dramology.
[367:42.72]And what that entails is... You drink a case of Coors Light...
[367:48.55]And then you try to do basic bath.
[367:50.99]Can you do it?
[367:52.49]Hey, you pass.
[368:03.51]Except don't do any of those things that I said.
[368:06.49]Drinking a case of Coarse Light not only sucks, because Coarse Light sucks.
[368:10.67]That would be a dumb idea.
[368:13.46]You would probably get hurt.
[368:14.86]So don't do it.
[368:20.90]What am I waiting for here?
[368:21.62]There we go.
[368:24.94]Isn't that just college?
[368:35.45]That's funny.
[368:37.47]How big is a case?
[368:39.77]Case.
[368:47.36]I don't want the old fucking Ursula bitch to kill me.
[368:52.10]I swear to god if Ursula kills me.
[369:01.11]I'm still on the ground.
[369:07.51]Dooo!
[369:09.49]That was-
[369:26.00]Why did I take so much damage?
[369:31.04]I took so much damage.
[369:32.94]That was not a big fall.
[369:36.38]That was such a small fall.
[369:38.36]Why did I take 90% of my health?
[369:48.11]If she didn't land on me, I would have been alright.
[369:49.70]She has such a huge sweeping swing too.
[369:58.92]I forget to send it up every time.
[370:00.72]Another scream cam.
[370:09.70]Nailed it.
[370:13.68]Hey, this game's hard.
[370:14.84]Come on, man.
[370:15.42]This is a hard game.
[370:16.94]You understand?
[370:17.86]I'm playing a hard game.
[370:20.38]Sometimes you play easy games.
[370:22.47]This one's hard.
[370:24.13]Ursula sometimes will land on you and jump on you like a fat motherfucker.
[370:27.55]It happens.
[370:28.73]Just be careful next time.
[370:30.77]This message is brought to you by Green Goo.
[370:35.01]Good day.
[370:35.51]Goodbye.
[370:42.87]There we go.
[370:43.57]Really, your hand.
[370:52.98]Your hand's not going to do that to me, is it?
[371:00.56]Get ugly.
[371:05.52]This is double-fisted me.
[371:08.52]Double-fist ground pound me, really.
[371:11.30]Might be time to take a... A little... Okay, for some... I thought this was a pregnant lady.
[371:23.97]I saw it in the corner of my eye.
[371:25.09]I was like, wait, hold on.
[371:25.73]What's this pregnant lady enemy?
[371:30.51]Whatever.
[371:31.27]Like, she's holding... Look at that!
[371:32.46]It's a big baby boy!
[371:43.12]I think I'm just going to drop.
[371:45.88]Oh, whatever.
[371:46.34]Where's the Jester?
[371:53.81]Is this the way I'm supposed to go?
[371:56.67]I don't think so.
[371:57.21]No, because there's the knight over here and that's the... How do I just get to the boss?
[372:04.31]We've got Jesters falling left and right.
[372:08.79]I went the wrong way.
[372:14.43]It's okay, though.
[372:15.11]I just want to go to the boss.
[372:16.97]I'm done exploring.
[372:21.79]Can I just go to his... There's got to be a secret room, right?
[372:25.17]Of course not.
[372:30.70]I'm curious.
[372:34.82]I'm alive.
[372:35.14]What's up, dude?
[372:41.38]I can't run in this.
[372:44.26]Maybe I can open the door.
[372:47.39]Squashed me like a bug.
[372:50.13]He's right on me.
[372:52.69]What is this?
[372:55.33]I can open the door.
[372:56.87]Just open the door.
[372:58.23]I can't open from the side.
[372:59.53]Yeah, I can.
[373:00.89]I'm letting the giant out.
[373:03.01]He's gonna go rain hell on everybody in Lordaeron.
[373:11.50]See you later.
[373:14.06]What does this say?
[373:14.92]Gorgeous view.
[373:15.92]Yeah.
[373:18.36]I did it.
[373:19.54]I beat the system.
[373:25.20]Now I can just walk in whenever I want.
[373:30.04]Ooh.
[373:33.12]Okay.
[373:40.96]Lothric.
[373:42.91]Lordaeron is World of Warcraft.
[373:54.50]I guess I... I think I have to go back in here.
[374:00.55]You're going to fight big guy.
[374:01.49]Okay.
[374:03.45]To fight big guy, I'm taking one of these.
[374:07.81]For some reason, I thought that was going to be... The entrance must be the other side.
[374:11.94]Is there a big door on the other side?
[374:13.06]A couple of big doors.
[374:16.66]Let's see if I can open... I just want to open up all the doors.
[374:24.85]What hit me?
[374:25.49]I dodged it.
[374:32.27]I need to not be locked on.
[374:41.24]Oh, it's so hard to move in this swamp.
[374:47.49]This is the way to go over here.
[374:48.43]Yeah, he's hitting me.
[374:51.61]Even after I'm dodging, he's hitting me after the fact.
[374:53.37]Oh my goodness.
[375:05.46]He has like a hundred years of reach.
[375:09.06]What the hell?
[375:11.00]Where did you guys come from?
[375:13.22]Where did they come from?
[375:15.24]What door did they come out of?
[375:16.32]Over here?
[375:22.63]Where is this?
[375:23.05]Alright.
[375:36.50]I'm not entirely sure what that does for me.
[375:45.73]Another door?
[375:53.61]Where is this leading to?
[375:59.27]I'm finding like too many skips.
[376:02.70]This must be the other side.
[376:09.39]Yeah, it is.
[376:12.65]Whatever.
[376:12.95]Guess I got to save my ember.
[376:19.79]I'm just gonna take this elevator.
[376:24.33]See where we go.
[376:35.77]Some random lady in here.
[376:50.19]where is this remember there's a ladder um deep ring what the hell is that
[377:21.14]Allows attunement of additional spells.
[377:23.77]Boring.
[377:24.39]Anything behind me?
[377:35.27]No.
[377:53.38]Secret.
[377:55.02]Secret.
[377:56.28]Secret.
[377:58.48]No.
[378:03.30]Secret.
[378:04.54]Secret.
[378:05.76]Secret.
[378:07.01]No.
[378:12.27]Secret.
[378:14.17]Who was that guy in the giant chef hat?
[378:27.94]This is really confusing and dangerous.
[378:31.82]Oh.
[378:33.60]Don't even.
[378:34.98]Don't even kid.
[378:38.78]Like, what's... Taking you on one by one.
[378:41.94]I gotta pee again.
[378:42.62]This is gonna cause a lot of problems.
[378:49.65]This is causing a huge amount of problems.
[378:52.85]My whole body is clenched because I don't want piss to come out of me.
[378:56.71]I gotta fight on banisters.
[379:03.54]Don't dodge like that.
[379:04.96]I would love it if you could just be in the right spot.
[379:17.98]Not right now.
[379:21.02]Curious what else is here.
[379:36.58]There's so many little areas to explore in this big castle.
[379:42.20]Secret?
[379:43.42]Secret?
[379:44.56]Secret?
[380:05.07]What?
[380:08.14]Somebody's invading me.
[380:08.90]I feel like a player is invading me.
[380:17.70]I think a player just invaded me.
[380:24.76]Alright.
[380:29.00]Good luck finding me.
[380:29.94]Because that's going to be a... He found me.
[380:35.84]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[380:36.70]Hold on a second.
[380:37.20]Important.
[380:55.73]Just a statue.
[381:04.59]Where is he?
[381:12.46]Where'd he go?
[381:41.09]What's up?
[381:42.39]You didn't expect me to be here, did you?
[381:46.63]What is going on?
[381:47.51]What are you doing?
[381:48.98]What?
[381:56.65]I don't think this guy... This guy's from like... Japan.
[382:08.49]Ow!
[382:09.19]Hey!
[382:10.55]Hey, get back here!
[382:13.65]You're in deep trouble.
[382:22.43]I want him to, like, fall off.
[382:24.06]Oh, he's hitting me.
[382:24.76]He's hitting me.
[382:27.16]Alright, I've had enough.
[382:27.86]I've had enough.
[382:35.27]This guy is lagging so bad.
[382:44.95]He keeps healing too.
[382:45.98]Wait, isn't that supposed to be BM?
[382:48.28]Fine, I'll do it too.
[382:56.26]I don't even know what direction he's facing or if he's swinging.
[382:59.30]I'm gonna kill him.
[383:02.38]I just killed him.
[383:04.06]I won the... I got... Look at how good I was.
[383:05.94]I won the PvP fight, guys.
[383:11.84]Thanks for playing.
[383:14.80]Bye.
[383:15.08]Alright, that was... That was fun.
[383:23.97]Let's go.
[383:30.77]Red statue has been destroyed.
[383:33.48]Hey, I only drank a potion because he drank one like three times.
[383:42.03]Where am I going?
[383:48.89]The statue, like, that was fun.
[383:51.13]I kind of want to get invaded again so I can just be the statue again.
[383:53.83]That's more fun than the game.
[383:57.19]Maybe I'll get invaded.
[383:57.90]And I can pretend to be a statue.
[384:03.00]First, let me go try to kill the giant.
[384:05.78]Because I feel like that's where I need to be.
[384:07.10]I don't know.
[384:24.81]I thought he was... He looked like he was friendly for a while.
[384:36.56]I thought he was gonna be a friend of mine.
[384:51.69]Maybe I should... Should I try to go kill a giant?
[384:53.85]I feel like that's not a terrible next... I'll go down here.
[384:58.63]I didn't look over here, I don't think.
[385:01.22]I might have, but whatever.
[385:02.66]This place is so topsy-turvy.
[385:06.68]I don't even know where I am going.
[385:10.58]Actually, I have been down here because this is the corridor.
[385:17.17]Yeah, I went all the way around.
[385:19.67]Let me just go back in the front door.
[385:41.47]Hey, Otto.
[385:47.17]I mean, I feel like... This is the next area.
[385:53.94]The next step.
[385:56.55]Unless I can just go this way and go around.
[385:59.27]I don't know.
[385:59.91]Okay, here's the door I opened before.
[386:02.43]I guess I'll try to kill Giant.
[386:06.23]You guys are in an odd spot.
[386:20.46]Clear them all out.
[386:23.92]What the hell is this?
[386:30.56]Huh?
[386:32.16]Is that a bridge?
[386:42.00]Can I lock him in?
[386:46.11]Good, I didn't think your buddies were gonna be right here.
[386:49.07]I don't get the purpose of that.
[386:55.09]Do I trap him in when I drown him or something?
[387:11.79]Big mistake.
[387:14.51]On my part, not yours.
[387:15.49]Oh, you're annoying.
[387:21.86]Annoying.
[387:22.46]By the time I'm able to, like, heal, this guy's already swinging a stupid fucking pulse blade again.
[387:33.99]And I'm not even hitting him.
[387:35.59]Why was I not?
[387:36.79]Fucking God, I'm going to start to scream.
[387:40.79]You obnoxious asshole.
[387:45.97]These tiny little corridors.
[387:51.31]Is that just what prevents him from coming over here?
[387:53.07]Is it two giants?
[388:00.78]There are two giants.
[388:07.04]What?
[388:09.95]So that just blocks them off so they can't... ...get you at the same time, I guess?
[388:17.02]I don't know.
[388:19.76]I don't know.
[388:26.46]Drive ang- yeah, don't drive angry.
[388:29.95]It's a good way to think about it.
[388:31.91]Sometimes... Sometimes you just gotta grab the wheel.
[388:49.14]Where does this go?
[388:54.70]Is this the... Oh, shit.
[389:01.36]Alright, here we go.
[389:02.82]I don't know if this is a... Is that an NPC?
[389:08.32]He had a really specific name.
[389:10.22]Longfinger Kirk...
[389:19.78]Like he had a real specific name.
[389:22.32]I feel like that's not a player.
[389:28.48]Where is he then?
[389:36.93]Hiding right there.
[389:39.89]Really hope the NPC doesn't invade me now.
[389:41.71]I don't know where I am.
[389:45.92]Oh, please, you... Oh, please.
[389:48.90]Please.
[389:49.58]I'm looking around for the NPC, and he's all... Good, you're an idiot.
[389:59.39]At least he's dumb.
[390:26.13]Didn't dodge that.
[390:29.34]I feel like... Is this guy lagging?
[390:31.62]Because I'm getting hit like a second after the fact.
[390:39.50]Where's the stupid invader?
[390:40.62]There he is.
[390:55.75]Wow, wow, you hurt Excuse you
[391:28.22]Yeah, and I shattered the chandelier too.
[391:32.82]Barbed straight sword.
[391:33.86]I think I dropped a lot of souls.
[391:42.62]Two D's.
[391:44.89]That's stance.
[391:45.47]It's like a rapier.
[391:49.77]Where am I getting these Estus Flask shards?
[391:52.23]Didn't I have no Estuses left?
[391:57.03]Interesting.
[392:06.35]Can't say I'm necessarily totally aware of what's going on.
[392:13.85]Is this another thing to pull?
[392:17.95]Oh, wait a minute.
[392:19.21]Wait a minute.
[392:21.13]Wait a minute.
[392:23.94]Let me use my brain here for a second.
[392:26.68]Let me just quickly use my brain.
[392:28.36]Let me think about this tactically.
[392:33.72]Okay.
[392:36.65]Does that mean that I can trap them?
[392:39.75]I don't know.
[392:48.75]Where's the shot, maybe?
[392:50.53]Where is he standing?
[392:52.15]Is there a door over there?
[393:08.40]Does it push this one up?
[393:18.75]No.
[393:19.03]I'm gonna just try to sneak over here, see if there's anything I can do.
[393:37.22]Anything sneaky I can do?
[393:38.22]There's a button to press.
[393:49.91]That doesn't really help me.
[393:50.81]All that does is... Man, I can walk through this though, right?
[393:58.19]At least protect myself?
[394:02.62]Is this all... I guess I gotta get behind him?
[394:13.05]Those items are going to have to be for another time when I'm less terrified.
[394:25.50]He's still hitting me.
[394:26.52]Just one.
[394:26.86]Just one.
[394:27.30]Just one.
[394:28.24]Just get one.
[394:28.62]Just get one.
[394:33.01]There's a person here.
[394:48.56]Yuck.
[394:52.36]Yuck.
[394:57.49]Oh, I gotta pee.
[394:58.33]I forgot to pee.
[395:00.03]I forgot to go to the bathroom.
[395:01.23]I forgot to pee.
[395:04.35]I forgot.
[395:04.81]That was like 30 minutes ago.
[395:08.30]Hey, if you can't beat him, run.
[395:20.24]Can't beat him, run.
[395:20.74]That's what my dear old granddad used to say.
[395:25.14]There's a boss right here.
[395:27.50]Shit.
[395:33.50]Alright, I think I might be able to take this guy along.
[395:37.18]That didn't... You swing a lot.
[395:45.44]You swing a lot!
[395:49.26]Why do you swing so much?
[395:50.36]Damn.
[396:04.55]I don't think I have any healing stuff.
[396:10.68]Well, I do have that, but I don't know if it's worth doing.
[396:19.51]Whatever the boss is, he's in there.
[396:22.70]Please tell me there's, like, a shortcut I can do.
[396:24.46]Like, on this side, maybe?
[396:30.32]Something, anything?
[396:31.00]What's getting here?
[396:38.00]Actually, it kind of sucks a lot.
[396:44.25]Got it.
[396:47.11]Got it!
[396:57.28]Where am I now?
[397:05.24]We're back now at the front of the castle.
[397:09.13]This should be the very front, very beginning.
[397:14.43]Yeah, try circling around.
[397:19.09]Cool.
[397:26.78]Cool.
[397:28.42]Totally cool, man.
[397:40.25]And isn't there the bonfire right here?
[397:41.85]Or right over here?
[397:45.47]Is this the general direction?
[397:48.89]I'm still being followed by a dude.
[397:54.04]Very menacing person.
[398:02.07]This is going to kill me.
[398:02.69]This is going to kill me.
[398:03.27]That's going to kill me.
[398:08.18]I'm not... There it is.
[398:10.04]Alright, I'm going to level up.
[398:29.14]Did I even have to go that way?
[398:34.10]Kind of confused right now.
[398:38.14]How do I get to that door?
[398:53.66]Yeah, I'm going to level up and then I'm going to go pee.
[398:55.46]And then we're going to attempt the boss a couple times.
[398:59.66]And we shall see how it goes.
[399:04.63]That's alright, I'm fine.
[399:05.69]Sometimes it just goes back in.
[399:27.63]Maybe the pee, like, traveled up into my stomach again.
[399:29.81]I can do one.
[399:38.32]Let's do another one in Dex.
[399:42.84]Ah, do what?
[399:55.87]Still need some more Large Titanite.
[400:06.97]I did get a Bone Shard, though.
[400:11.86]That's not how P works.
[400:13.16]It's going to go back up to my stomach.
[400:21.88]Okay, guys.
[400:25.19]I'm going to take like a two minute break.
[400:27.27]I will be back.
[400:29.03]And the stream is only going to be maybe like another half hour, 40.
[400:31.22]Depending on how long it takes to attempt the boss a couple times.
[400:35.16]And I'll see you guys soon.
[400:36.56]Be right back.
[402:47.81]Alright.
[402:49.86]Let's give it a go.
[402:51.90]Last night, I got, like, completely and totally sucked in to needing to beat that fourth boss before I turned the stream off.
[403:03.14]So, that's not gonna happen tonight.
[403:04.64]Because I'd like to get work done on this video.
[403:10.55]I do want to stream again tomorrow, though.
[403:13.13]I do want to beat this game on stream.
[403:16.94]But we shall see.
[403:18.24]I might be a day late.
[403:21.30]And a dollar short.
[403:24.36]But that's okay.
[403:27.03]Can't win them all.
[403:31.41]Hmm.
[403:47.55]Let's get some charcoal resin.
[403:51.14]Might as well give it a solid attempt, right?
[404:00.67]Have you ever heard of water sports?
[404:03.39]Yeah.
[404:06.51]Isn't that like polo?
[404:08.99]Water polo?
[404:18.79]So this thing that I just opened is not over here.
[404:25.56]It's like on the other side.
[404:26.70]Is there a fast way for me to get from here to there?
[404:31.28]Besides having to run all the way around the whole building?
[404:33.54]I don't know.
[404:37.77]There's been like three separate skips in this place that have all confused me.
[404:44.21]There's like four different doors to open.
[404:48.53]I don't think this is even the right way.
[404:53.24]I'm gonna just go around.
[404:54.62]I really don't feel like... I feel like this is a skip to go up to where I was before.
[404:58.54]There's two different doors here.
[405:09.66]Where's the correct one?
[405:19.25]This goes around here.
[405:20.21]I don't even know.
[405:24.69]Because I go up the ladder and across.
[405:30.15]Let me just take a look on the other side.
[405:43.48]This is the first area that I've played so far that is actually utilized.
[405:50.49]There's like this many skips to different places in the game, in the map.
[405:59.06]Because if I go around here...
[406:04.96]Can I just walk in the front door?
[406:07.95]Like, where's the front door?
[406:09.21]I'm listening.
[406:19.79]Reckless pansy.
[406:23.70]Reckless and a pansy.
[406:25.38]Well, that's two different types, I guess.
[406:30.98]The front of the castle, like, it was just so long ago.
[406:35.59]It was like an hour ago that I was standing in front of the castle.
[406:41.85]That I just seriously don't even remember which way is even the right way to go.
[406:50.71]Is it back around?
[406:52.69]I have no idea.
[406:55.01]I like climbed.
[406:57.77]I'm going to bleed here.
[407:03.17]Because it's this here.
[407:05.64]And climb this.
[407:09.84]And I peed out all my memories.
[407:19.59]But no, reckless thanks or something.
[407:23.99]You just handed me a $5 bill, so... All I can say is thanks, dude.
[407:31.57]And there's the front.
[407:32.91]I guess you just kind of have to do that.
[407:34.17]I don't think there's a faster way to do that.
[407:39.98]Alright, you're just going to be a pain in my ass.
[407:54.70]I don't know what you are.
[408:04.33]How do you fast forward through the boring part of the stream?
[408:08.55]Well... You don't.
[408:11.81]You have to watch me do this.
[408:14.29]Well, actually, you don't have to do anything.
[408:16.17]You could, uh... You could go make a snack.
[408:18.95]You could go watch... You could go watch Nickelodeon.
[408:21.83]You know?
[408:25.86]You could... There's an item right here.
[408:30.23]Go watch the newest episode of Better Call Saul.
[408:32.02]It was a great one.
[408:32.78]It was a good one.
[408:34.08]No spoilers for anybody that hasn't seen it, but it was a good one.
[408:47.30]Well, it was a good one.
[408:49.84]You know, the world is your oyster.
[408:51.08]You can really do whatever you want.
[408:54.62]Okay, boss.
[408:57.63]Let's see.
[408:58.95]Look at all.
[409:00.21]Oh boy.
[409:03.17]When you see this many summoning signs.
[409:06.53]This many.
[409:08.77]I feel like this boss is going to be extremely difficult.
[409:14.05]You don't see this many summoning signs.
[409:16.31]People are so desperate to beat this guy.
[409:18.01]I don't know.
[409:20.09]We'll find out.
[409:20.79]I have to beat the choir.
[409:26.53]Deacons of the Deep.
[409:30.32]Alright.
[409:30.76]Look at the one fat guy.
[409:32.48]Look at like Friar Tuck over there.
[409:34.62]Oh, I'm too busy.
[409:35.14]I forgot they attacked.
[409:48.80]Where's the Deacon?
[409:50.46]This is just Royal Rat Vanguard again, but with guys with skull heads.
[409:58.98]I'm gonna assume the guys with the flame are the ones that you have to kill?
[410:02.28]No idea.
[410:08.33]Are they getting bigger?
[410:25.50]I'm just going to go start a riot in the middle.
[410:28.64]Alright, we're doing a riot.
[410:35.27]Mosh pit.
[410:35.83]It's rocked up.
[410:48.19]I heard something.
[410:49.46]I heard somebody.
[410:50.64]I don't know who it was.
[410:54.92]Is it the big ones?
[410:55.76]I don't really know.
[410:59.96]Yeah, it's the ones that are lit up.
[411:02.91]The ones that are... That's easy enough.
[411:11.49]I guess not yet.
[411:15.95]Why were there this many summoning signs for this?
[411:21.88]There were so many.
[411:25.15]Unless this changes to be something horrible.
[411:28.58]Which it very well could.
[411:29.56]Oh, right, we've got a lot more people here.
[411:32.00]Now I... I gotta kill the pope!
[411:37.30]There he is, the guy that... I gotta kill the demon pope in the middle.
[411:48.34]Stand in front, my children.
[411:49.88]Yes!
[411:57.01]What are they doing?
[411:57.67]Are they healing him?
[412:01.27]I think they are.
[412:10.05]That was... Why were there that many summoning signs?
[412:18.36]Fucking demon pope.
[412:25.15]Usually when you see that many summoning signs, it's a really bad sign.
[412:31.25]That was the easiest boss in the game.
[412:41.79]Whatever.
[412:42.03]What else is in the room?
[412:49.30]I guess maybe you could get overwhelmed there if you didn't understand what was going on.
[412:53.42]But they didn't really do much attacking.
[412:58.76]They were just walking around looking at me.
[413:00.69]And sometimes a guy would shoot a fireball.
[413:02.21]I don't know.
[413:10.15]No, that's not a...
[413:17.27]Yeah, that was... Royal Rat Vanguard.
[413:23.70]They just said, hey, here's Royal Rat Vanguard again.
[413:27.04]Except this time there's a Demon Pope instead of a rat with a mohawk.
[413:33.39]I don't think there's anything else I can do in here.
[413:36.83]Did I get a doll?
[413:37.35]No.
[413:49.09]Small doll.
[413:49.51]There it is.
[413:54.83]It's possible.
[413:55.39]Maybe I just got really lucky RNG.
[413:56.71]It's possible.
[413:59.61]Stars was the same thing.
[414:02.89]Huh.
[414:04.61]I guess sometimes you gotta have an easy boss.
[414:12.77]It was over here.
[414:13.67]Him.
[414:27.97]Don't you get an ember or something for getting summoned into another person's world and killing the boss with them?
[414:31.49]So maybe they're doing that.
[414:32.37]Yeah, that's probably true.
[414:38.79]Let's see.
[414:39.51]If there's anything interesting for the boss item.
[414:46.14]More people here.
[414:46.68]Oh, and we meet again.
[414:48.82]We spoke before on the Road of Sacrifices.
[414:52.20]Anri of Astora.
[414:54.62]I'm well pleased to see you safe.
[414:56.08]We reached the Cathedral of the Deep.
[414:58.66]But Aldrich's coffin was empty.
[415:01.04]The man-eater must have left for his true home.
[415:03.18]The man-eater?
[415:04.02]The little doll in the empty coffin told me.
[415:08.06]Aldrich is said to hail from Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, an ancient fabled city.
[415:15.24]A pilgrim told me that the city lies beyond Faron Keith.
[415:18.80]I've already been there.
[415:21.02]And so becomes our destiny.
[415:23.19]I'm already on my way.
[415:24.04]Is this guy gonna still grunt at me?
[415:25.90]Yeah, you are.
[415:26.50]Grr, grr, grr.
[415:55.93]Where is that dude?
[415:56.73]Where's my friend?
[416:01.25]Push her off the ledge?
[416:03.07]That wouldn't be very nice.
[416:07.65]Why do I hear swinging sounds?
[416:11.29]Oh, duh.
[416:17.38]First, let me see what the boss soul is.
[416:22.48]Listen to me, son!
[416:24.96]Ironic waifu.
[416:27.38]Thanks for something, ironic waifus.
[416:36.37]And Mr. Squishy, back to back.
[416:37.37]Both of yous.
[416:46.55]Thanks for the stuff.
[416:48.93]Cleric's Candlestick.
[416:50.51]This is a caster weapon, so... We're going to smash this orb.
[417:01.08]Where is it?
[417:03.32]No, it's blue.
[417:05.55]It's blue.
[417:05.95]That means it's different.
[417:16.22]Alright, it's because that boss was so easy for me at this point.
[417:24.91]I... Am I at the soft cap?
[417:32.71]Because that boss was not that much of a pain in the ass, I remember I said, I'll give it like a couple attempts.
[417:38.16]I will go to the next bonfire that I'm supposed to go, use the doll, and just kind of poke around a little.
[417:43.34]It's still not super late.
[417:44.92]It's 1.45 here AM.
[417:49.56]So I still have a little bit of time before it gets to be kind of a little too late.
[417:55.27]Famous last words, I know.
[418:00.22]I paid five bucks for a guy on the internet to say my name.
[418:02.92]What am I doing with my life?
[418:06.08]That's not a good way to look at it.
[418:08.84]You paid five dollars to be part of the shock jocking piss drinkers.
[418:18.69]There he is.
[418:24.37]Is he dead?
[418:29.85]Who killed him?
[418:38.83]T, T, and T. T, T, and T. Somebody already did.
[418:43.07]I didn't do this.
[418:49.57]Did I kill him?
[418:51.37]Can I remember killing him?
[418:52.45]I don't.
[418:52.81]I don't think I did.
[418:54.67]But somebody did.
[418:55.70]Oh, he just died down here.
[418:59.53]Well, I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.
[419:07.59]Really kind of confused by that.
[419:14.23]Who did that?
[419:19.47]For real, who did that?
[419:20.49]Who killed him?
[419:21.25]Why would you kill him?
[419:23.83]He's my friend.
[419:30.63]What if there's a guy over here with a bloody axe?
[419:32.41]I haven't been out here in a long time.
[419:47.43]Oh, look at the Rocky Mountains.
[419:51.13]There's a guy up here.
[419:53.73]Time for regret before you don't deserve this.
[420:08.72]This dude has no clothes on.
[420:18.06]Should I not be killing this guy?
[420:19.16]Is he an NPC and I did something wrong?
[420:20.54]I just smoked this guy.
[420:24.52]Should I have done that?
[420:25.34]Whoa.
[420:35.24]What?
[420:37.27]Why would this guy have all this stuff?
[420:44.49]The uchi- the uchi-gatana?
[420:54.68]Why would a guy over here have all this stuff?
[420:56.14]What's back here?
[420:57.88]Listen to me, son!
[421:00.39]I'm your dad!
[421:02.80]Destroy him!
[421:06.22]Whoa!
[421:07.98]Melons are good.
[421:11.36]Alright, I'm just like really confused right now.
[421:13.46]I was just, I read that sub.
[421:17.67]I read that sub like I was reading text in the game.
[421:21.19]Melons are good.
[421:26.99]Melons are good, thanks for subbing, welcome.
[421:30.49]What else did he give me?
[421:35.11]That was cool.
[421:35.91]He dropped like his hat too.
[421:38.37]Was that what it was?
[421:39.03]No.
[421:44.61]Master's attire?
[421:45.59]That doesn't make any sense.
[421:55.86]I don't understand.
[421:59.06]But that's a katana.
[422:00.21]These things are sweet.
[422:08.68]Well, those of you that are watching, you can get a katana within the first, like, 40 minutes of this game.
[422:17.13]Just don't go in the shrine and go over there and fight that guy.
[422:20.63]This is a pro tip.
[422:22.00]This is a pro streamer strategy I just gave to you.
[422:27.24]Happy to be a shock-jocking piss-drinker.
[422:30.40]That's good.
[422:32.18]I mean, is that, like, a special secret item?
[422:33.73]Is that anything better than what I'm using?
[422:38.70]What is the special?
[422:44.93]Oh, that's so cool.
[422:48.29]You can just do a power stance with it.
[422:50.41]I wish I had known this.
[422:58.17]14 hours ago, because I probably would have just been using this for the whole game.
[423:04.31]Instead, we're using the booger spear.
[423:15.63]Alright, let's go back.
[423:17.49]I don't even know how I got up here.
[423:23.84]I honestly just forgot how to even get here.
[423:25.24]I'm just going to jump off the cliff.
[423:28.02]Who is this?
[423:28.66]There's another guy over here.
[423:29.80]This guy's an NPC.
[423:34.46]What a shame.
[423:47.00]To be fair, the Katana guy is really hard to kill right away.
[423:50.22]Oh, I guess... Yeah, that would probably... Yeah, he took a lot of hits.
[423:55.20]With, like, me having, like, a plus five weapon.
[423:57.50]Whatever.
[424:17.27]How come these guys don't want to be inside the shrine?
[424:20.15]Wouldn't you be safer in the shrine?
[424:27.27]Everyone is telling me to kill that guy.
[424:29.45]Kill him.
[424:30.57]Kill him.
[424:31.39]Kill him.
[424:31.99]Destroy him.
[424:35.03]I don't know.
[424:36.59]I don't think I can do that.
[424:37.75]He could be important.
[424:45.04]I'm not going to destroy him.
[424:58.93]Was I doing what does he but he doesn't do anything He doesn't do anything
[425:23.69]Marry him, divorce him, take half his items.
[425:28.33]That's cruel.
[425:30.35]You're talking cruel.
[425:31.31]Alright, now we can pass into Hogwarts.
[425:38.31]Is that big alligator guy gonna be back?
[425:45.28]No.
[425:55.30]What does that icon on the top left mean?
[425:59.72]Looks like a guy kind of falling over and hitting his head on the ground.
[426:01.84]What does it mean?
[426:08.55]Getting a real Bloodborne vibe from this place as well.
[426:10.97]This looks like Yharnam.
[426:13.69]In fact... This is Yharnam.
[426:20.43]I'm just stepping into Yharnam.
[426:22.68]Good.
[426:33.67]Ah, just wish I had yarn and blood of your own.
[426:47.92]Oh, that's the smoky roll icon.
[426:49.36]Okay, I get it.
[426:55.46]Ah.
[426:56.44]With a little bit of yarn and blood of your own.
[427:01.54]Yeah, this is the circle with the two big dudes.
[427:03.10]This is just, like, going into central Yharnam.
[427:09.24]Or the cathedral.
[427:09.76]This is the cathedral ward.
[427:14.84]I like this area.
[427:20.76]Give me something.
[427:31.73]What the fuck is this?
[427:34.39]That's not an NPC.
[427:36.25]I mean, that's not a player.
[427:45.58]Whatever.
[427:48.36]How many teams have I played Bloodborne?
[427:54.58]I've beaten it four times.
[427:59.76]I never really did New Game Plus.
[428:03.11]I went through it, like, halfway, but I'd... I'd rather... I'd like to make other characters, and... To me, playing the game normally feels... Oh, game almost crashed.
[428:14.96]I don't know.
[428:18.24]I like the fact that you're starting from the very beginning with zero.
[428:21.06]You're not strong at all.
[428:21.82]You don't have anything.
[428:24.24]I like that feeling.
[428:25.85]It makes it feel like you're actually building up a new character rather than playing through the same game.
[428:30.13]With like a crazy beefed up character.
[428:32.09]This guy's a scary.
[429:04.09]Damn.
[429:10.51]That's faster than these.
[429:12.03]Oh, I rolled into him.
[429:14.23]Rolled behind him.
[429:21.23]Come on.
[429:21.47]I know you just rolled a two, but it'd be nice if you could swing.
[429:29.05]Don't want to fight anymore.
[429:32.08]Just want to circle around.
[429:35.00]And back up.
[429:36.86]We're done.
[429:38.57]Okay.
[429:39.75]Well, it was a good fight.
[429:48.45]Do something!
[429:48.99]God.
[429:53.95]They really do look like ringwraiths.
[429:54.99]That's a good description.
[430:01.87]Can't go in there.
[430:02.45]That looks like the skip.
[430:11.77]I need one more of those and I can upgrade.
[430:16.87]Which, you know... Woohoo!
[430:35.06]Bullshit.
[430:35.56]I can go over there.
[430:51.39]Come on.
[430:53.80]I want everybody on speedruns live to know that, like, I found this.
[431:02.10]Whatever.
[431:11.53]Praise the not here.
[431:13.35]Heh heh heh.
[431:15.45]Heh heh.
[431:23.42]You guys kind of suck.
[431:30.60]Too old.
[431:32.64]Big guy with a spear.
[431:38.34]Can't say I'm excited to see you.
[431:41.91]That's a huge spear.
[431:51.99]Alright, this guy's a magician.
[432:05.94]Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[432:17.38]That guy just got juggled.
[432:18.28]You can do that through the wall.
[432:28.09]I'm not happy about you.
[432:30.77]Man.
[433:00.91]You're gone.
[433:03.13]You're done.
[433:06.96]When you're grouped up like this, it's hard for me to get the swings off, isn't it?
[433:35.10]Grinding some good souls though.
[433:36.24]Another one of those guys up top.
[434:01.61]Worth a shot.
[434:10.25]Look, another snow mount.
[434:30.70]I can upgrade my sword.
[434:34.26]I might just go do that.
[434:38.50]Right now.
[434:40.08]Right now.
[434:40.54]I hit the wall.
[434:55.71]I'm gonna need you to calm down, sir.
[435:12.02]Fuck.
[435:15.66]Oh, moment of truth.
[435:18.06]Do I just homeward bone out of here?
[435:21.98]What's he doing?
[435:22.40]Oh, let me just take a sprint.
[435:33.20]Looks like I can... Oh!
[435:40.75]I didn't think he was right behind me.
[435:46.05]I have to kill you.
[435:46.75]I just can't... I have to kill you, but you're so dangerous to me right now.
[435:55.07]I'm kind of just running in a circle to get away from him.
[436:11.49]I escaped.
[436:13.59]What's this?
[436:18.45]Huh?
[436:27.42]Seeing if I can just rip it open.
[436:28.84]Yeah, I'm home.
[436:29.52]I'm using the bone.
[436:31.73]It's time to bone out.
[436:37.49]Holy shit, please bone out.
[436:51.64]I can upgrade my thing.
[436:53.82]I might be able to level up once or twice too.
[437:02.08]Absolutely.
[437:02.54]Yeah, when in doubt, bone out.
[437:10.78]This will bring me to 154 plus 74.
[437:16.04]Blink.
[437:22.01]And I need 6.
[437:22.73]And that should get it to plus 6, right?
[437:47.97]Now...
[438:04.33]I'm not sure.
[438:07.49]If I infuse something, does that replace the shard level ups?
[438:22.50]It does.
[438:23.76]Then maybe I'll try one.
[438:26.72]One that doesn't scale off of intelligence or something like that.
[438:34.14]Level up three times.
[438:49.42]Uh, let's do... Let's do two.
[438:53.76]And one endurance.
[438:55.92]Farewell, Ashen.
[439:00.85]May the flame...
[439:02.36]Okay, guys.
[439:04.02]That's going to wrap it up here.
[439:07.22]I will catch you guys probably tomorrow.
[439:12.04]If not, then you'll probably see the stream the next day.
[439:17.36]It depends.
[439:17.92]If I still have the itch to want to stream and play the game, I'm going to do it.
[439:22.14]It's either that or I finish up a video that's like half done.
[439:25.77]I haven't started in length.
[439:27.69]I haven't started working on this video for about three days now because of Dark Souls.
[439:34.04]But that's going to be it, guys.
[439:35.04]Thanks for watching.
[439:36.30]Thanks to all the new subscribers.
[439:37.86]Thanks to everyone hanging out.
[439:40.64]Peace be with you.
[439:41.93]You know, shake the person's hand next to you.
[439:43.81]Say, peace be with you.
[439:45.03]And the other person to your right.
[439:46.37]Peace be with you.
[439:50.11]Good night, guys.
