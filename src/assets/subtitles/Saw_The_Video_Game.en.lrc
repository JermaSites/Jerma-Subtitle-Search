[00:00.99]Don't let him.
[00:02.05]Don't let him get away with this.
[00:03.13]Don't let him get away.
[00:04.49]He's not here.
[00:06.55]He was here 45 seconds after he said he was going to be.
[00:09.37]Don't let him get away with this.
[00:13.43]Controller.
[00:13.99]Hi, everybody.
[00:20.76]Can't get away with it.
[00:23.52]Welcome back.
[00:26.17]Another unfilled few days coming up here.
[00:34.46]Move some stuff.
[00:35.24]Did that tweet go through?
[00:36.48]Did you see it?
[00:36.90]What's wrong with my audio?
[00:45.60]What's wrong with your audio?
[00:49.07]Go in the back of your speakers and grab that little cord that connects to your headphones or whatever and just... You'll get it.
[01:00.01]This is not like an AM radio station, but it might work.
[01:11.54]Don't touch that dial now.
[01:14.00]Where's the baking stream?
[01:15.92]Uh, Friday.
[01:17.94]Easy Bake Oven stream is Friday, green screen DLC for free is Saturday.
[01:26.78]What's wrong with your face?
[01:31.59]I don't know.
[01:33.89]Nothing.
[01:34.69]It's perfect just the way that God made me.
[01:38.27]Okay?
[01:43.53]God gave me this big bump in my nose.
[01:47.19]And that's the way that he created me.
[01:54.35]Don't blame that shit on God.
[01:57.89]And then all of a sudden I get interrupted.
[01:59.31]Excuse me.
[02:00.23]No, no, that's not how it happened actually.
[02:03.57]I gave you a perfectly sculpted nose and you broke it on a trampoline.
[02:10.13]You jumped on a trampoline and landed on your back and your knees came back and hit you in the face.
[02:14.62]And broke your nose.
[02:15.94]I was perfect.
[02:19.22]That's kind of what happened, actually.
[02:22.38]Real story.
[02:29.29]Add it to the wiki.
[02:31.39]I could say anything.
[02:32.79]And you guys would add it to the wiki?
[02:34.01]Okay, how about...
[02:38.65]Okay, I was born with an extra pair of hands.
[02:46.50]What is it?
[02:49.36]I had 20 fingers.
[02:49.91]Okay, that's all that.
[02:54.83]I'm just going to put it on there.
[03:00.05]We knew that already.
[03:00.99]It's already there.
[03:02.47]It's just there already.
[03:04.29]No, we're gonna play Saw today.
[03:05.49]I know, people... We were in the pre-stream chat talking about this, and everyone's like, wait, what are we gonna do today?
[03:10.44]There was a one-guy opportunity, but I didn't see any that I didn't want to... I didn't take any one-guy opportunity of.
[03:16.74]Does this game suck?
[03:24.30]That's my question.
[03:27.27]We got the illusion of choice.
[03:31.70]No, you got the reality of suggestion.
[03:37.29]I will take your suggestions, but that doesn't mean I'm going to do them.
[03:49.27]Hurry up and stream the fucking game.
[03:53.60]It's been four minutes.
[03:55.04]I've just...
[03:57.32]I am one of the only people on this website, and I'm gonna toot my own horn.
[04:01.86]I'm one of the only damn people on this website that starts their stream within like five minutes of pressing the fucking button, okay?
[04:09.19]So give me a little bit of that slack.
[04:11.69]I deserve it.
[04:15.05]I deserve that.
[04:15.93]I know he's got a bunch of money.
[04:17.23]Holy shit.
[04:19.39]I deserve it.
[04:22.81]No, but for real, I may start my streams late, but when I turn, when I hit that fucking button, we go within five minutes.
[04:31.61]I know a lot of people on this website give you like a 20 to 30 minute window at the beginning where they turn their streams on.
[04:37.71]Like some people have like a 15, 20, 30, 40 minute intro.
[04:42.61]And that's how they run their business.
[04:46.44]But I run my business, you know, with rappers open.
[04:51.43]And ice cream half-eaten and shit.
[04:54.42]Prices are very low.
[04:58.42]Freddie gave 50 subs.
[05:03.48]50 community subs from Freddie Dredd.
[05:06.00]Freddie's back again.
[05:06.82]Dreddma sucks, lol.
[05:13.84]What the fuck?
[05:18.04]I seriously wonder what would happen in this community.
[05:21.18]You know, we're going to do an experiment one day.
[05:23.04]I'm not going to tell you when.
[05:24.52]But I'm going to see.
[05:27.33]I'm going to have a starting soon screen that has like a 25 minute countdown.
[05:35.01]I wonder how many of you guys would, at like the 18 minute mark, are just going to crack.
[05:42.11]And be like, where is he?
[05:43.87]Where is he?
[05:45.63]Get him!
[05:50.19]Give me the stream.
[05:53.29]I'd crack at 28.
[05:54.59]Yeah, you'd crack at the one minute mark.
[06:02.26]Roast him.
[06:03.06]Roast him.
[06:03.58]Roast him.
[06:04.48]Don't roast me.
[06:05.28]What did I do?
[06:08.46]But Freddy, seriously, that's another fucking 50 community subs.
[06:11.02]That's insane.
[06:16.48]What do you say we get started?
[06:18.02]Hey, it's been exactly seven minutes since I've pressed the stream button.
[06:22.60]And, what?
[06:23.80]What's that?
[06:25.08]Right here, right here.
[06:25.75]I'm ready.
[06:26.39]Okay, here we go.
[06:30.03]New game, let's go.
[06:38.43]I don't know who... Wait, what is this?
[06:39.75]Why are you linking me to this?
[06:46.52]I don't know who German95 is and thanks to this game, I never want to know.
[06:50.42]Uh... Uh... Spaceform German slots is a slots game.
[07:01.81]Like the strip slot son... What?
[07:06.73]Midigame acknowledge...
[07:08.62]Yeah, whatever.
[07:10.60]What do you want me to do?
[07:12.62]If somebody has an opinion on something, whatever.
[07:16.35]You can't expect every person that ever... Hold on a minute.
[07:21.23]This person doesn't understand every single reference that's ever been made on this stream?
[07:25.96]He has not had the countless amount of experiences that we've had.
[07:30.14]I'm just a dickhead on his Steam recommended list.
[07:35.40]Like, imagine seeing that Jerma Life is Pain face and clicking on that and being like, who is this fucking person?
[07:39.93]I don't give a shit about this guy.
[07:44.67]Modem.
[07:56.82]What do you want me to do?
[07:57.68]It's fine.
[07:58.08]Whatever.
[07:58.44]It's...
[08:01.09]You can't have people like just every single ever experience that I ever have with another person online It's gonna somebody's not gonna be happy.
[08:11.05]It's fine.
[08:11.93]It's all right Just wait till they see this when they see the shpee video and I guarantee you they'll be fucking they'll be on board Where's the get where's the scary game?
[08:25.03]scary cam?
[08:26.57]no
[08:29.29]No, I'm not doing, there's no, but this is not a scary game.
[08:34.09]Check the audio settings.

[09:39.75]Alright, let's go.
[09:59.21]This game's- I'm not gonna- This game we're gonna be done in probably like 10 minutes.
[10:03.31]Normal or insane mode?
[10:05.55]Why- I don't want to play this game on insane.
[10:14.64]Why would I pick insane?
[10:17.40]No, we're doing this on fucking- We're doing this on normal.
[10:21.53]Some clues are revealed in the dark.
[10:22.97]Like, $50!
[10:23.25]$100!
[10:23.37]Holy shit.
[10:23.67]Hold on.
[10:31.22]Every choice has a consequence.
[10:32.70]Wait, there's consequences?
[10:34.14]Is this like a bad, is this like a gory game?
[10:42.63]It's a Telltale game.
[10:49.79]It's Saw.
[10:51.43]Yeah, but it's Saw the video game.
[10:53.25]That doesn't follow the movies.
[10:56.46]SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom was not based on a SpongeBob episode.
[10:59.76]They just made a game.
[11:04.00]Wait, this does happen in the movie.
[11:06.06]Looks like this is keyed in.
[11:32.37]You have lost your family, your badge, even the life of your partner, Detective Singh.
[11:38.81]You have lost your health, whittled away by the bullet wound in your chest.
[11:43.53]But you have not given up, have you?
[11:45.53]Now we will see if you can overcome your obsession.
[11:48.79]Okay, so get the key that's in your eyeball.
[11:53.73]It is evidence left over from your investigation.
[11:57.94]Here's what happened.
[12:12.11]He's waiting for one of these times when he kind of forgets the key.
[12:14.51]He's just sitting right on the table.
[12:16.67]He's watching.
[12:18.17]He's like, oh shit.
[12:20.73]Oh wow, there's like 40 more people in other rooms.
[12:24.10]I'm doing it.
[12:24.80]Left stick.
[12:30.34]Wait, do I have a key?
[12:34.37]Wait, what am I supposed to be doing?
[12:36.11]Press B. Oh, I pressed B.
[12:40.78]It's a QTE.
[12:43.90]I don't have an Xbox controller, man.
[12:45.56]What the fuck?
[12:52.91]What?
[12:53.13]Escape the bathroom.
[12:54.11]There he is!
[13:08.55]Okay.
[13:09.53]Wait, should I look at the things in the ground?
[13:11.25]What's that?
[13:19.30]Have you health bar in this game?
[13:20.76]What do you fucking even do in this game?
[13:22.38]Wait.
[13:31.81]1, 3... I just figured out a puzzle.
[13:35.37]1, 3, 4?
[13:36.19]Okay.
[13:36.95]I just didn't even mean to do that.
[13:39.81]Wait!
[13:40.51]No!
[13:40.73]4, 1... 4, 3... What is this?
[13:46.29]This is doing something else.
[13:47.57]What is this doing?
[13:49.75]4, 3... Why is it doing this?
[13:52.51]4, 3, 7.
[13:55.03]4, 3, 7.
[14:02.18]Four, three, seven.
[14:07.45]That's a puzzle?
[14:10.25]He definitely rushed this one.
[14:15.49]This game, I guess it takes place after Jigsaw went public.
[14:20.61]And now he's got to keep his share prices up and he's got to continuously grow and shit.
[14:23.89]And you've got to get like, there's got to be a hundred people a day.
[14:28.23]Puzzles can't be fucking that good.
[14:31.67]Find Jigsaw's next clue.
[14:33.11]Does this game suck?
[14:44.42]Wait, I just went in here.
[14:46.42]Oh, detective.
[14:47.92]Turns out you're a fucking idiot.
[14:49.40]You went back in the room that you escaped from.
[14:57.41]This is an ugly screen.
[15:00.15]Anyone out there?
[15:00.63]Help.
[15:02.65]Oh no!
[15:06.06]That's my room.
[15:10.24]Alright, hold on.
[15:11.26]I gotta look for achievements.
[15:18.65]What just happened?
[15:31.71]Co-op That's easy you just gave me the solution What is his task
[15:57.93]You have to dig through needles.
[15:59.35]You have to stand there and be scared.
[16:01.53]What do you mean teamwork?
[16:03.49]Listen, this guy in black dropped something in one of those toilets.
[16:07.28]Well, which one is it?
[16:07.94]Do we have a timer?
[16:08.58]We have a timer.
[16:10.08]One hour?
[16:10.96]I got an hour and 20 minutes, man.
[16:12.78]Just relax.
[16:14.52]Wait, it's a... Okay, hold on.
[16:20.69]You are trapped.
[16:21.32]Search the toilet for the fuse before you pass out from pain.
[16:24.34]What?
[16:24.68]What do you mean?
[16:25.60]Then use the fuse on the fuse box to power the door.
[16:28.84]Press the green button to open the door.
[16:31.36]How do I search the... Grab.
[16:34.05]What the fuck?
[16:36.93]Did I get it?
[16:42.39]You know, this... I got it!
[16:47.18]If you have a fuse, you can use it to activate a fuse box.
[16:49.50]Turning on a fuse box will power a door, turn on lights, or even create a deadly electrical trap for your enemies.
[16:55.92]Once the electricity is on, watch out for nearby puddles of water.
[17:01.35]Okay, um... I did it.
[17:04.37]Okay, why are there enemies?
[17:11.48]What classifies this as an enemy in a Saw game?
[17:15.46]Alright, we're good.
[17:16.50]Come open the door.
[17:17.10]That was record time.
[17:23.32]Wow, that was a good guess.
[17:24.88]Um... You have bare feet, certain hazards, and the environment will injure you.
[17:28.28]Like a broken glass ahead.
[17:30.02]Okay.
[17:31.18]So... Climb on box.
[17:45.22]Like, just jump to that and climb on it and just shimmy over there.
[17:47.98]Or just lie on your back and just earthworm backwards.
[17:51.61]Slowly.
[17:51.99]Did that work?
[18:00.07]Why can't I just jump on that?
[18:02.84]Just do it like cats do.
[18:07.86]Wait, that didn't even hurt.
[18:13.09]It's not really a hazard then.
[18:14.85]Okay, just to be aware of that, I'm gonna step in that all fucking day.
[18:17.33]Alright, what's in here?
[18:26.00]Do I need to do anything, or does it not matter?
[18:28.34]This door's sealed, right?
[18:31.52]This is just a game where you do QTEs.
[18:33.90]And like, watch people get their heads ripped off and shit.
[18:37.52]Health, hypo.
[18:40.37]Okay.
[18:41.35]Press and hold X to use a health hyperdermic.
[18:43.77]These will restore your health.
[18:44.69]The longer you hold down X, the more health will be restored.
[18:47.92]Oh.
[18:48.68]Okay.
[18:49.72]Cool.
[18:50.82]Thanks.
[18:56.20]Let there be light.
[18:56.89]Press Y to turn on your light.
[18:58.29]Right now you have a lighter.
[18:59.33]Other light sources can be found and each is unique.
[19:01.69]Okay.
[19:03.41]First of all, hold on a minute.
[19:04.78]I got $100 from Pluto passing by and then $50 from Goiki.
[19:09.82]So I want to make sure I address that because that's a lot of fucking money.
[19:13.18]Pluto passing by gave 10,000 bits.
[19:15.01]$100 fucking dollars.
[19:16.09]Jeremy, it's my 21st birthday today.
[19:17.99]Here's some birthday bits.
[19:19.01]Thanks for making me laugh.
[19:20.41]Love you and chat.
[19:23.75]Thanks for the $100 fucking dollars.
[19:26.08]No, no birthday face cam.
[19:27.22]I'm sorry.
[19:27.50]It's not going to happen.
[19:33.17]Happy 21st.
[19:36.97]Milestone.
[19:38.45]If you live in America.
[19:42.90]Nice job.
[19:44.16]Nice job.
[19:44.84]Nice job.
[19:45.56]What do I mean, nice job?
[19:47.66]Nice job on getting there, I guess.
[19:50.06]What do you mean, nice job?
[19:53.48]He didn't turn in his paper early.
[19:55.60]Oh, wow.
[19:56.56]You turned in your thesis like two days early.
[19:59.05]Nice job.
[19:59.91]Nice work.
[20:01.78]I mean, you still... Jeremy, you still got it.
[20:04.40]Oh!
[20:06.50]I wanted to talk about this.
[20:07.48]This fucking reminds me.
[20:09.68]I actually was looking at my degree the other day.
[20:14.96]And in the... I was going through some personal files that I had to... I wanted to get situated.
[20:20.39]Because obviously I moved.
[20:22.33]And I got my full... Every class I've ever taken and every grade I've ever gotten in college.
[20:28.79]And you want to know something funny?
[20:32.83]I got an F in pickleball.
[20:36.86]I swear to God.
[20:38.64]A fucking F in pickleball.
[20:39.64]I don't even know how.
[20:43.43]I could prove it.
[20:43.91]I could.
[20:44.33]I have the document.
[20:45.83]I got an F in pickleball.
[20:47.21]I don't know how.
[20:47.69]How do you get an F in pickleball?
[20:49.21]What do I do?
[20:50.39]I just not go?
[20:53.29]I have no idea.
[20:54.53]We could go all of my grades.
[20:56.49]I got like an F in like a media class.
[20:59.87]I don't even know how.
[21:01.51]I got like a D. One of my GPA was.
[21:04.45]All right.
[21:05.29]This is important.
[21:06.03]I know I got a game to play.
[21:07.83]What do you guys think my cumulative, cumulative, whatever that fucking hard to say word is.
[21:12.94]What's my, what was my GPA?
[21:15.02]What was it?
[21:17.16]Over the course of the whole time I was in college.
[21:25.44]It's lower than 4.
[21:26.58]I can tell you that.
[21:28.58]It's lower than 3.
[21:29.80]I can tell you that.
[21:31.62]It is higher than 2 and is lower than 3.
[21:36.61]Not a 1.8.
[21:37.59]I don't think you can even graduate with a 1.5, right?
[21:40.47]2.6.
[21:41.79]You got it.
[21:42.41]Yep.
[21:42.67]2.6.
[21:42.69]I don't even know what that is.
[21:46.51]That's like a C, right?
[21:47.41]Like a C+.
[21:47.93]Something like that.
[21:54.50]But because I would get A's in some classes.
[21:58.65]And then I would get F's in classes that I just didn't give a shit about.
[22:02.19]It's bad.
[22:03.59]I know.
[22:03.89]Like it was either I got it like an A minus or an F. So it evened out over the years.
[22:12.51]I got a light.
[22:13.85]But anyways, thanks for the 100 fucking bucks.
[22:15.51]Also, Goiki, thanks for the $50.
[22:17.30]Jeremy, hello again.
[22:18.02]I'm excited for this game because I like the movie.
[22:20.36]Even though it's shit.
[22:21.72]All of chat's saying this game is shit too, but I don't care.
[22:23.78]I'm excited.
[22:24.34]Me too.
[22:24.86]You should be.
[22:28.52]I got an effing pickleball.
[22:29.42]I'm trying to go through my brain as to where, why, and how that happened.
[22:33.49]That was supposed to scare me, but it was too late.
[22:36.75]That's supposed to fall when I first walk over here.
[22:42.81]Wait, I have... Don't say anything.
[23:02.92]Wait, I have a key.
[23:07.90]I have the key.
[23:08.54]Alright, here we go.
[23:09.26]It's gonna be another door closed.
[23:11.95]You don't walk in this room.
[23:13.42]You know what you do here?
[23:14.64]You just stand right here and you peek in the room to trigger the infrared beam that triggers when somebody comes in to try to close the door.
[23:22.16]Peek in, get the fuck out.
[23:23.44]And the door will slam.
[23:31.22]Bolted shut?
[23:32.12]Wait, what?
[23:36.01]Okay, well, oh, yeah.
[23:38.17]Why can you do this?
[23:42.42]Alright, go on.
[23:43.68]Go on.
[23:44.43]Right.
[23:44.85]Uh oh.
[24:08.89]The point of pain in the ass would be to have these old TVs.
[24:11.75]Why do they have to be fucking old TVs?
[24:13.13]That's one thing I don't understand about horror movies, especially Saw.
[24:16.47]Why isn't there, like, a flat screen back there?
[24:17.97]They're cheaper.
[24:18.57]You know how hard, you know how expensive this probably is to get to work?
[24:24.97]Like, this shit wasn't like this, like, three days ago.
[24:28.42]He came down and, like, put a bunch of trash down here and, like, painted blood on the walls and stuff.
[24:31.86]It wasn't like this down here.
[24:35.46]This is a huge project.
[24:36.58]Will you appreciate your life?
[24:40.03]Sure.
[24:44.78]It's his craft.
[24:54.56]Wait, what?
[25:00.20]Is this a game where I'm gonna get chased by a monster?
[25:06.95]It's not, right?
[25:10.43]Ah, somebody else will read this.
[25:11.43]Construction is completed on Whitehurst Asylum for the Insane.
[25:14.14]We've finally done it.
[25:14.90]I'm told all the staff has ad nauseum.
[25:18.40]And somebody else will read this.
[25:20.40]Actually, it's not that long.
[25:21.18]It's okay.
[25:25.24]I think we can make a real difference here.
[25:26.48]Whatever.
[25:26.72]Somebody else will read this.
[25:27.50]I can't.
[25:33.36]Do I really get chased around?
[25:41.06]How many of these things exist?
[25:43.58]You don't do this by yourself.
[25:48.50]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:49.26]One guy in his, like, 70s is supposed to be able to do this?
[25:52.94]This is like a 200 to 300 person project.
[26:00.41]Detective Tam will be here soon.
[26:01.17]This is the first victim of his obsession.
[26:06.09]He should be able to hear her, but she is drunk.
[26:21.26]Find the key to her cell.
[26:24.58]Search the body.
[26:26.06]Save the woman in the surgical theater.
[26:27.46]Okay.
[26:31.95]Oh.
[26:32.41]Alright.
[26:38.82]Read file?
[26:40.42]Read the door and puzzle pieces?
[26:46.53]Oh, sorry!
[26:47.95]What are you talking about?
[26:53.37]You don't say sorry and then do it again.
[26:55.15]Do I?
[26:58.00]Is my arm gone?
[26:58.80]He hit my arm off!
[27:00.48]He took my arm off with a swing of the bat!
[27:03.20]Combat stance.
[27:03.96]Hold the left trigger to enter combat stance with either your fist or a weapon.
[27:08.65]Press A for a light attack and X for a... Okay, A and X. Block with the B button.
[27:15.93]Okay.
[27:23.46]Fucking hit him.
[27:24.66]Put the lighter down.
[27:25.66]Are you fucking serious, dude?
[27:32.22]How did you miss?
[27:33.53]You missed?
[27:34.15]This is your fault.
[27:42.05]How are you a detective?
[27:43.89]He punched through it.
[27:45.21]You can't block a fucking... Swing!
[27:49.93]Swing!
[27:51.44]Swing!
[27:57.50]Oh my god.
[28:05.61]That's like scripted.
[28:11.09]Wait, huh?
[28:12.35]What do you mean?
[28:12.89]There was no auto save anywhere from that point forward, okay?
[28:18.83]No way what oh?
[28:37.97]No checkpoint I'm gonna let's go.
[28:41.57]I need I gotta play this game.
[28:42.61]You think I'm not gonna fucking play this game.
[28:49.18]I Can't believe there's no save X come on hurry up Where are you?
[29:05.05]With four, three, seven, we don't even need to listen.
[29:06.97]Imagine.
[29:08.67]Oh, detective.
[29:10.35]It's time for you to play again.
[29:11.83]I got the door open.
[29:12.61]Wait, I, how did you do that?
[29:14.29]I'm not done being scary.
[29:26.20]Yep, yep, yep, yep, I know.
[29:28.66]Help, somebody help me.
[29:30.30]Holy shit, what happened?
[29:41.40]I know!
[29:41.72]Got it.
[29:48.53]Alright, get up.
[29:54.50]What does give up do, I wonder?
[30:01.00]Put it in!
[30:09.85]I think that's locked until one minute.
[30:15.21]You can't beat that within the minute.
[30:16.67]It's locked until exactly one minute.
[30:24.86]Don't walk on it.
[30:25.62]Fuck, whatever.
[30:26.22]I'm strong.
[30:28.72]Okay, we're good.
[30:29.72]Take it all.
[30:30.80]Yeah, yeah, hold X. It's dark in here.
[30:39.39]If we get out quickly, this does happen.
[30:41.48]Because, yeah, there's this guy.
[30:42.72]Scary.
[30:43.36]We don't even need to watch this.
[30:46.18]We already watched it.
[30:47.66]Who cares?
[30:48.50]But, I mean, you know, we kind of... Well, let's... Might as well.
[30:55.57]I did that.
[31:01.67]Okay, don't fucking lose here.
[31:14.12]I don't care.
[31:14.54]That's a loud TV.
[31:16.48]Save?
[31:17.20]What do you mean save?
[31:18.12]Where?
[31:18.30]How do I save?
[31:42.03]There is no save.
[31:42.79]What are you talking about?
[31:43.63]Save.
[31:51.93]It's too early to save.
[31:52.95]Okay.
[31:57.64]Yep.
[31:58.10]There you are.
[31:58.66]I'm gonna save you.
[32:01.74]Alright.
[32:02.14]Here we go.
[32:03.32]This is sealed.
[32:04.00]Wait.
[32:04.88]Is this timed?
[32:06.42]When this actually... Did I miss a trigger point here?
[32:13.70]Did I not look down here?
[32:16.30]Did I go too fast?
[32:17.34]Did I break the game because the TV kept playing?
[32:22.24]I didn't, right?
[32:23.42]No, this door's sealed.
[32:24.82]There's no way.
[32:28.27]It's probably timed.
[32:34.13]You went too... I went too fast.
[32:37.47]I did?
[32:37.91]No, I didn't.
[32:44.44]What the fuck did I just do?
[32:45.30]Did I just take a heal?
[32:57.17]She's dead.
[33:00.15]Stop doing drugs.
[33:03.75]Wait.
[33:04.61]Audio tape.
[33:07.05]Oh, come on.
[33:17.66]Alright, let's go.
[33:18.06]Where is he?
[33:21.87]Alright, press A for a light attack and X for a heavy attack.
[33:24.43]Block with B. Counter attack.
[33:31.47]What?
[33:39.00]He's got me cornered.
[33:42.28]Dude, this game doesn't make any sense.
[33:44.06]Attack!
[33:44.76]Attack!
[33:45.42]Hey!
[33:45.60]Hey!
[33:45.74]What?
[34:09.55]I am holding the trigger it takes so long to queue up a swing that was before you realized there was a bomb in your brain that only would activate if you said that you were going to leave or a twist or a twist just like all the other ones we do
[34:48.66]Many of you are... Somebody will read this.
[34:50.64]Wait.
[34:51.81]Find Detective David Tapp.
[34:53.45]I've concealed a key inside his body.
[34:55.15]Wait.
[34:56.91]Many of you are... Hold on.
[34:58.21]I can do better than this. ...
[35:18.09]I can do better than that.
[35:21.09]Alright, let's go in here.
[35:23.43]Door's sealed.
[35:24.71]Alright, let's heal.
[35:25.49]Good.
[35:46.32]That was completely incomprehensible.
[35:50.26]Alright, I got the door open.
[35:51.29]Save.
[35:52.83]When does this game auto-save?
[35:54.85]I'm just walking on fucking glass.
[35:56.43]God damn it.
[35:57.41]Is there more glass?
[36:01.01]Shotgun doors.
[36:01.83]Jigsaw has booby-trapped doors in the asylum.
[36:04.15]Quickly press the appropriate button as the pulley descends.
[36:07.59]If you press the wrong button or fail to press the right button, you will be on the receiving end of a shotgun blast.
[36:13.03]Oh, great!
[36:22.11]Can I go in?
[36:31.95]Some locked doors can be picked with items around the world.
[36:35.77]Door, unlock.
[36:37.67]I need a pin.
[36:38.53]I need a screw.
[36:39.49]I don't want to go in here.
[36:43.41]Wait, isn't there a lady...
[37:06.88]What the hell was that?
[37:34.99]I can't understand.
[37:43.92]Too much.
[37:44.40]Too much.
[37:44.74]Hold on.
[37:45.88]Let me monitor.
[37:50.43]Let me... Hold on.
[37:51.27]What does it sound like?
[37:53.13]Repeat that.
[37:53.83]How bad is it?
[37:54.43]I know I was having a funny little joke there, but how bad is it actually?
[37:59.49]Let's see.
[38:01.02]Let's see.
[38:05.12]Oh, this is really bad.
[38:10.37]It's just like a cell phone dropped call.
[38:12.65]You can't even hear fucking anything.
[38:15.03]Hold on.
[38:15.51]Hold on.
[38:37.36]Okay, this is an entire... What's this?
[38:40.91]This is a little... This is a little better.
[38:43.33]Hold on.
[38:46.28]This is... No.
[38:47.74]This just sounds weird.
[38:49.66]This just makes me sound like... You know, here's the thing.
[38:52.54]The thing about this that I want to really talk about.
[38:54.62]This is... Welcome to every single, every single talk AM radio station that you've ever listened to in your whole life.
[39:00.83]And they think they have the audacity to bring everybody back in here and talk to this.
[39:06.65]Okay, I gotta get this right.
[39:09.65]Uh, how's this?
[39:10.99]No.
[39:11.91]How's this?
[39:12.65]No.
[39:13.11]Wait, hold on.
[39:14.11]Make your choice.
[39:17.21]Make your choice.
[39:20.35]Make your choice.
[39:21.99]Make your choice.
[39:22.93]Make your choice.
[39:23.94]Make your choice.
[39:26.78]Let this work.
[39:28.06]This is better.
[39:29.94]This is better.
[39:36.40]Inside is a key.
[39:38.39]Inside that key is another key.
[39:42.37]the eye of the first key to get to the second key.
[39:45.95]Yeah, that's better.
[39:49.14]Yeah.
[39:49.28]All right, we're good.
[39:55.14]That works.
[39:57.45]Five nights at Freddy's.
[39:58.81]Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[40:03.69]Ilo Ren.
[40:06.28]Everything.
[40:06.74]Wait, there's somebody that's getting drugged over there.
[40:08.74]Is drug going into that person or something?
[40:10.40]I have to go stop the drug flow?
[40:12.28]Whatever it is.
[40:12.76]Alright, I'm ready.
[40:13.97]Guys, everything is Kylo Ren.
[40:17.95]Every low radio voice is Kylo Ren.
[40:23.77]Wait, pick up what?
[40:24.83]Antigens.
[40:26.91]Health items can be used instantly when TAP picks the item up.
[40:30.11]It cannot be stored in TAP's inventory like health hypos.
[40:36.28]Do a dinosaur roar?
[40:40.94]Alright, you want me to do a dinosaur roar?
[40:52.49]And then take that and lower it, because that's how they did the T-Rex.
[40:58.97]Take that, lower it, and add a bunch of weird shit to it.
[41:01.99]T-Rex is like a trumpet or something, right?
[41:07.89]Isn't the T-Rex like a trumpet or a trombone that they fucked with?
[41:14.51]An elephant.
[41:19.21]What am I thinking of?
[41:22.65]Wait, that's not what it is?
[41:24.81]What's the very, very popular... I'm doing the T-Rex like... The T-Rex sound effect is just the Jim Carrey annoying sound that they slowed down.
[41:44.89]Alright, where the fuck am I going?
[41:48.98]It's true.
[41:49.60]Yeah, I mean, I know!
[41:54.20]Silly streamer made a silly noise.
[41:55.68]I need a thing to unlock this.
[41:57.66]Wait, blood.
[41:59.24]There's blood in here.
[42:02.60]There's no, uh, screws or anything I can pick up?
[42:04.53]Do you have, like, a screw?
[42:08.87]Who-
[42:13.41]Do I have to punch its head off?
[42:18.64]Ajax, thanks for the five community subs.
[42:21.98]And Poofinator for the ten community subs.
[42:24.36]And MyDeadCat for the ten community subs.
[42:26.59]What the fuck?
[42:27.45]That's a lot of community subs.
[42:30.21]Thank you.
[42:41.34]Where the fuck am I supposed to get a screw?
[42:47.58]Remember, the screw is loose in your head.
[42:53.58]Where is this?
[42:54.60]What?
[42:54.92]I was just over here.
[42:56.04]Hold on a minute.
[42:57.38]I opened this already and it said there's nothing in there.
[43:02.30]This fucking game sucks.
[43:03.82]Some of the doors are rigged with lockpicking puzzles.
[43:06.00]I saw the puzzle rotate each piece to match the symbols along the inner ring of the... I gotta pay attention.
[43:11.04]Save.
[43:11.70]There is no save.
[43:13.71]Where do you expect me to do this?
[43:17.93]Rotate each piece to match the symbols along the inner ring of the chamber.
[43:24.21]There is no save.
[43:24.97]There's just restore checkpoint, but that's blocked off.
[43:31.63]What the fuck is this?
[43:44.00]What kind of lock is this?
[43:47.12]Alright, does the game save?
[43:50.63]Where's my auto save?
[43:57.43]Save the woman in the surgical theater.
[43:59.07]Find a key to unlock the main hallway door.
[44:04.81]Save, save, save.
[44:07.10]Insert your memory card.
[44:08.98]There's a 500 gig memory card in here.
[44:13.04]Whoa!
[44:17.30]Holy shit.
[44:19.20]Let me see it.
[44:19.50]Let me see it.
[44:19.90]Come on.
[44:20.24]Let me see it.
[44:20.66]I haven't seen it once.
[44:22.61]What the fuck?
[44:23.57]Is this even Twitch?
[44:24.37]Is this even a Twitch chat?
[44:25.69]Unbelievable.
[44:26.49]Thank you.
[44:26.95]What the fuck?
[44:27.57]I'd like forever to see it.
[44:29.03]I expect that every time.
[44:33.57]Not all my subjects protest their games, such as you, detective.
[44:38.94]Some seek purpose and to be tested.
[44:42.70]Some even create their own.
[44:47.27]Um, I'm sorry, Mr. Jigsaw.
[44:49.71]If you lock somebody in a room with barbed wire around them and they have to, like, crawl out of it, the fuck are you talking about?
[44:57.88]You, you, you're just, like, torturing people.
[45:06.06]Yeah, it was to symbolize their greed.
[45:10.46]Oh, so you wrapped barbed wire around their head and put them in a giant meat grinder.
[45:15.81]Yeah, they were greedy.
[45:17.53]Oh.
[45:19.77]You feeling all right?
[45:20.45]Are you all right?
[45:21.07]He drank water?
[45:32.17]That's a perfectly normal thing to do, is wrap somebody up, cut their arms and legs off, bury their head in sand, surgically implant tubes in their body that they have to pull out and then connect to a wall.
[45:45.13]And then those tubes then feed to another person's mouth.
[45:48.93]And yeah, the guy had insurance fraud.
[45:51.90]This might be a little too far.
[45:53.54]Maybe I'll think about it out loud.
[45:59.78]My name is Rose.
[46:00.40]I am eight years old.
[46:02.84]My mommy says I have polio.
[46:04.49]Polio is bad.
[46:05.15]I have it worse than Uncle Jack.
[46:08.79]He can still walk, though he seems drunk.
[46:10.50]So I am now in this machine.
[46:11.66]A breeze swept me so they can call it an iron lung.
[46:13.84]Her says she will write what I say once a day so my diary doesn't forget who I am.
[46:17.57]She is my only friend.
[46:35.91]So Jigsaw, let me get this straight.
[46:37.47]Yeah, you're talking to me.
[46:39.17]So you removed a little girl who needed this to live.
[46:42.78]To put somebody that, like, did heroin in it.
[46:46.14]Yes.
[46:47.78]Okay.
[46:51.69]Make your choice.
[46:52.43]I'm going away for a fucking long time, dude.
[47:10.92]What's the fun of this?
[47:29.62]Who's paying the utilities?
[47:33.02]Him!
[47:36.50]Yes, he made so much money that he did insurance fraud and he made $200,000 off of other people.
[47:45.48]Jigsaw, how much money do you have?
[47:46.76]It's not about how much money I have.
[47:52.28]Yes, it was $6 billion to make this facility where I torture people that are bad, that were greedy.
[47:59.67]Jigsaw, why didn't you build, like, 30 schools?
[48:01.77]Well, um, because people need to be taught a lesson.
[48:05.95]And... No question, we were just trying to get the key out of your ass.
[48:09.65]Or out of your sternum.
[48:11.87]Or your eye.
[48:12.83]Wherever I decided to put it.
[48:14.05]Some of you have noticed the walls starting to buckle in some areas and have some... Become permeable.
[48:22.32]Please move all violent patients out of these rooms, lest they break down the walls to escape.
[48:26.20]The construction manager I talked to this morning... Alright, so we can break walls.
[48:31.51]The walls in the asylum are rotten and weak.
[48:33.03]Break them open to reveal a new path.
[48:36.19]Mr. Green is just Jigsaw.
[48:41.80]No way.
[48:43.78]I feel so strong right now.
[48:48.18]Minecraft.
[48:52.69]Fucking Minecraft.
[48:55.29]Why?
[48:55.77]That's funny.
[48:58.67]Fuse.
[48:59.17]Okay.
[49:02.80]I got a fuse.
[49:04.70]Can the bottom drawer be opened?
[49:07.58]How do I save the game?
[49:08.72]Is there no saving?
[49:17.48]How do I save the game?
[49:27.56]Saving is greedy.
[49:37.23]I'm gonna die.
[49:37.99]I'm gonna fucking die.
[49:39.73]What is this?
[49:40.29]The key to survival lies within.
[49:43.39]Save the woman in the surgical theater.
[49:45.09]Find a key.
[49:57.60]Pick up the scalpel.
[49:58.54]Okay, so we get... What do you mean the knife will betray you?
[50:09.37]Read the toe tag.
[50:11.37]Jim Omen.
[50:14.51]Wait, hold on.
[50:15.31]We've got like... This is Omen.
[50:19.16]J. Omen.
[50:19.90]Doesn't have a key buried into his heart.
[50:22.76]He smoked cigarettes.
[50:25.34]You spent years smoking cigarettes.
[50:26.62]Now die with a knife from a guy that you don't know.
[50:30.42]M. Johnson.
[50:31.16]Okay, no.
[50:33.14]Okay.
[50:35.19]A. Faulkner.
[50:44.34]Om Robinson.
[50:48.48]Arnie Faulkner.
[50:49.50]Alright, Arnie.
[50:51.06]I don't know what you did.
[50:52.14]Wait, am I gonna get attacked?
[51:17.66]Okay, at what point do you, like, make a little noise and be like... To the left!
[51:25.68]Left!
[51:27.66]Left!
[51:28.24]Not me!
[51:28.93]Like, you gotta give something a code, right?
[51:34.07]Like, wiggle your toes like... This is A. Faulkner, right?
[51:45.91]Is the guy alive?
[51:47.47]Not anymore.
[51:51.75]What about this guy?
[51:52.65]This guy just dies?
[51:53.61]No, no, not again.
[52:00.15]I passed your test already.
[52:02.29]Yet you did not learn your lesson.
[52:04.67]I'm sorry, okay?
[52:05.64]I couldn't help it.
[52:07.40]Of course you could.
[52:09.20]You chose to let your addiction consume you again.
[52:21.39]You know, he's such a fucking weirdo.
[52:22.71]I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was like a... Like, she was eating a lot of Oreos.
[52:28.64]I just really like Oreos!
[52:29.86]Your Oreo addiction is too much.
[52:32.44]For me to handle.
[52:35.96]The hell is this?
[52:46.19]You get it?
[52:48.59]Tag.
[53:01.73]I have determined.
[53:02.97]You had too many Pornhub tabs open.
[53:04.71]You can bolt some doors by pressing X. This will keep most enemies from opening the door.
[53:10.65]Yeah.
[53:11.59]You had... You had 30 Pornhub tabs open.
[53:16.05]In one sitting.
[53:17.83]This is unacceptable.
[53:19.61]Now I need to get the key and... And I'm looking at his computer.
[53:22.98]Like, his computer's open.
[53:23.80]I get, like, into his office.
[53:24.68]He's got, like, 50 Pornhub tabs open.
[53:27.16]Yeah.
[53:27.56]Fucking do as I say, not as I do.
[53:29.04]Right, Jigsaw?
[53:30.14]Fucking asshole.
[53:40.10]Okay.
[53:40.92]I'm getting actually concerned about the game not saving.
[53:43.82]At all.
[53:44.16]Ever.
[53:44.66]Once.
[53:44.84]This is concerning me.
[53:51.25]I have to sign in?
[53:52.13]How am I not signed in?
[53:53.33]You have to sign in?
[53:55.49]I am signed in!
[53:56.54]Hold on.
[54:00.98]Is that really what's fucking going on?
[54:03.46]No, it can't be.
[54:04.60]Is it?
[54:10.01]I'm not even fucking signed in.
[54:11.25]Your call is okay.
[54:23.58]Do you want to exit the session and test your network?
[54:25.76]No, no, no, no, I don't.
[54:28.25]No.
[54:30.99]What did you do?
[54:38.26]Oh my god!
[54:39.46]Thank Jesus!
[54:46.66]Wait, there is no save file.
[54:49.86]Oh my god!
[54:51.58]No!
[54:53.08]What the fuck just happened?
[54:54.89]Are you kidding me?
[54:58.19]Wait!
[55:05.37]Oh no!
[55:06.43]No, man!
[55:07.39]What?
[55:10.11]I can't even believe it.
[55:12.63]I can't even believe it.
[55:14.05]No, this game, I want to play this.
[55:15.79]I can't believe it.
[55:18.03]It's not on this one?
[55:18.93]Like, did it go somewhere else?
[55:25.94]Oh, shit in my pants, man.
[55:30.60]Oh, shit in my pants.
[55:34.67]Oh, this is just diarrhea.
[55:36.87]Oh my god.
[55:37.67]I can't believe it.
[55:38.71]Why would it take me out?
[55:40.01]No!
[55:43.21]No!
[55:45.83]I don't!
[55:46.83]I can't!
[55:48.71]You gotta be kidding me.
[55:49.99]I gotta go fast.
[55:51.75]I gotta go really fast.
[55:52.91]Fuck!
[55:54.09]This sucks.
[55:55.21]Just absolute asshole.
[55:58.24]Oh, no.
[55:58.72]I want to play this.
[56:02.33]Oh, this sucks total ass.
[56:04.81]I can't believe it.
[56:05.75]It's the second fucking checkpoint.
[56:08.53]Oh, god damn it.
[56:10.07]I'm so disappointed.
[56:11.39]My disappointment is immeasurable right now.
[56:16.57]Okay, let's go.
[56:17.81]I'm going to go fast as hell.
[56:19.38]I'm going to skip every cutscene.
[56:20.38]I'm going to run.
[56:20.88]I'm going to punch.
[56:25.62]And where is the prompt?
[56:37.08]There's no, there's no prompt.
[56:38.44]I was spinning it.
[56:46.14]Fuck, I'm so mad.
[56:48.36]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[56:52.48]Okay, fucking god.
[56:54.44]I'm gonna need to, like, just be quiet and just shut my fucking mouth and beat this.
[56:58.46]I can't fucking believe it right now.
[57:07.08]Shitload of people here right now.
[57:08.36]What the fuck happened?
[57:11.78]8,000 people here.
[57:18.54]Okay, fast, fast, fast, fast.
[57:20.76]437.
[57:23.58]I was wondering why I wasn't getting any achievements.
[57:25.60]Fucking not even... Fast.
[57:31.81]I don't care about anything.
[57:42.73]Hey, watch it.
[57:43.71]Yep.
[57:44.15]Yeah.
[57:44.51]Yep.
[57:44.87]Okay.

[57:59.45]Get out of the bathroom.
[58:03.67]Bolted closed.
[58:05.41]I want some privacy.
[58:13.76]No fucking around.
[58:14.92]I'm not even trying to fuck around.
[58:16.08]Get at him immediately!
[58:20.52]I have a full minute to do this, guys.
[58:22.10]It's not a problem.
[58:26.34]Hey, thank you!
[58:27.58]Thank you!
[58:32.52]Watch out for the... Take the pain.
[58:33.64]Alright, let's go.
[58:34.42]Hurry.
[58:42.94]Achievement, yes.
[58:44.15]Treasure.
[58:44.75]Oh my god, I was wondering why I wasn't getting these.
[58:46.39]How would I not be signed in?
[58:48.55]How am I not signed in?
[58:49.81]How?
[58:51.83]It's impossible to not be signed in right now.
[58:53.33]Alright, speedrun.
[58:54.99]I gotta go.
[58:55.31]Slider.
[59:03.68]There's a checkpoint every 15 fucking seconds.
[59:06.42]I can't believe that this went this long without me understanding and realizing that.
[59:18.13]Wait a minute.
[59:19.15]I'm like catching up to this guy.
[59:21.57]Am I not supposed to catch up to this dude?
[59:25.57]Wait, he's getting... He's not going to be up here, is he?
[59:38.00]Yep.
[59:39.32]Okay.
[59:40.00]There are going to be lots of sacrifices to make.
[59:41.56]Hello?
[59:43.64]Help!
[59:48.94]Yes, get that.
[59:50.13]Okay.
[59:50.69]Yep.
[59:51.29]There's drugs in there.
[59:53.15]Careful.
[59:55.29]Go.
[59:55.43]Don't even give him a chance.
[60:05.01]Yeah, I know.
[60:08.87]Okay, I pressed A. You just have to counter everything.
[60:15.73]Okay, we're good.
[60:17.97]Okay, holding... You don't understand.
[60:19.25]You do like a full crow hop before you swing a light attack.
[60:23.56]Why did I watch that again?
[60:25.94]I didn't need to watch that.
[60:38.63]Door's sealed.
[60:39.07]Yep.
[60:39.35]Alright.
[60:39.61]Get that key.
[60:42.05]Move.
[60:43.37]This door's sealed.
[60:44.11]Alright.
[60:44.29]Go.
[60:48.51]Yep.
[60:48.69]There's a note here.
[60:49.35]Good.
[60:49.92]Okay.
[60:50.40]Who is the jigsaw killer?
[60:54.10]I don't know.
[60:54.58]I wonder.
[60:57.56]What did I do here?
[60:58.98]I don't even remember.
[61:00.26]What was it?
[61:06.32]Everything's sealed.
[61:07.00]What did I have to do?
[61:10.76]There's a key inside his body.
[61:11.74]Yeah, I know.
[61:12.22]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[61:14.80]Oh, yeah.

[61:44.79]Get this up.
[61:45.35]Touch that.

[61:52.99]Got it.
[61:54.76]Okay.
[61:54.88]Cool.
[61:55.20]Nothing in here.
[61:55.90]Go.
[61:56.48]Out.
[61:57.04]I win.
[61:57.28]Nothing in any of this shit.
[62:02.64]And that's it?
[62:04.14]Key?
[62:05.54]Unlock the door.
[62:13.99]No, I want to go down.
[62:23.33]Out of this.
[62:23.59]All right, go.
[62:24.08]Good.
[62:29.50]I've made it back pretty much to where I was.
[62:31.28]Find a key to unlock the main hall.
[62:35.08]That was down here.
[62:35.62]Remember, I was like, I built a school, right?
[62:40.25]Remember when I did that?
[62:41.53]Something like that.
[62:42.27]All right, let's go.

[63:16.20]And then there's a key.
[63:17.16]I almost just... I almost just died right there.
[63:24.75]Okay.
[63:25.33]The key to survival lies within, right?
[63:27.37]And then you have to, uh, cut into the... to... Oh, right.
[63:30.49]A Minecraft punch.
[63:34.47]Does it work with your head?
[63:35.45]Save.
[63:38.54]Save.
[63:38.86]The game is saving.
[63:39.78]I got it.
[63:40.20]It's fine.
[63:47.59]You're getting participation trophies.
[63:54.03]It's always so funny back in the Xbox days.
[63:57.05]When they... It really was just tied to if you progressed in the game or not.
[64:10.15]What is that even supposed to mean?
[64:11.41]If I get it wrong?
[64:13.81]And the knife stabs me instead?
[64:16.94]Alright, let's go.
[64:17.54]It's this guy, right?
[64:18.64]Yeah, it's Arnie.
[64:21.71]Alright, Arnie.
[64:25.07]Sorry.
[64:32.66]Body punches you.
[64:33.94]That's so dumb if that's real.
[64:35.30]Okay, use the key.
[64:37.10]Yup.
[64:39.10]Okay, here we are.
[64:39.84]We made it.
[64:40.18]We're good.
[64:47.23]You can bolt doors, I know.
[64:51.43]The Oreo lady, yeah.
[64:53.65]Wait.
[64:56.78]Okay.
[64:56.94]There's got to be a reason why you do that, right?
[65:00.18]Watch out for that glass.
[65:01.54]Alright, now I just need... Over here.
[65:07.64]Made it.
[65:23.10]That guy just mortal combatted himself.
[65:28.16]Some ways through the asylum were more dangerous than others.
[65:30.76]Use left stick to walk over the hazard and use right stick to balance.
[65:37.63]He even did like a front flip too.
[65:41.51]He treated this like it was a ball pit at McDonald's.
[65:44.25]Alright, is there anything else here?
[66:03.81]It's right here.
[66:04.87]Thank God I signed in.
[66:07.81]Why would you do that?
[66:08.87]Just go across it.
[66:10.07]What the fuck are you doing?
[66:19.88]Whatever.
[66:20.28]I got the key, right?
[66:21.10]Is this guy open?
[66:22.16]Yeah, let's go.
[66:25.91]Oh, thank God.
[66:26.79]Yeah, no, it's fine.
[66:33.14]To be fair though, wouldn't you sprint across that shit?
[66:37.32]Why would you balance beam?
[66:38.40]No, just do a full sprint and jump and leap the fuck over the whole thing.
[66:42.78]Why would you balance beam that?
[66:51.83]No, that's not the way to do it.
[66:56.57]Look at the distance here.
[66:57.41]That's not that far.
[66:58.45]If you go...
[67:01.56]That guy had the right idea, but he just rolled off.
[67:21.03]I have my... My, like, steering needs to be aligned.
[67:23.49]It pulls a little to the left.
[67:32.33]Freedom.
[67:35.15]Can you rescue her, Detective Tapp?
[67:38.46]Can you rescue her, Detective Tapp?
[67:45.46]Is she in there?
[67:46.06]Hold on.
[67:46.86]Is there something over here?
[67:47.60]Freedom.
[67:50.19]Freedom is an illusion.
[67:51.97]Okay.
[67:56.11]And 600 million dollar facility.
[68:01.20]Is this baking soda?
[68:03.30]Bandages.
[68:04.70]I have full health.
[68:05.32]Why would I have not full health?
[68:07.74]You either fall down on the spikes and die, or that's it.
[68:19.90]What is this trying to tell me?
[68:21.60]I need to find a coupler.
[68:25.24]Alright, I got a nail.
[68:26.52]I got nothing.
[68:30.03]Unlock the cabinet.
[68:39.03]Thank God the puzzles are 100% brainless.
[68:44.44]And I mean 100%.
[68:45.32]Like, there's been nothing that you really need to even spend more than one to two full seconds understanding how it works.
[68:56.57]That just makes me happy.
[68:58.87]I don't want to do puzzles and shit.
[69:00.25]Fuck that.
[69:00.63]Who wants to do puzzles?
[69:06.77]Let's get the fine thing.

[71:29.86]Oh no.
[71:30.40]Not another one of these.
[71:31.04]Alright.
[71:34.51]Just take it slow.
[71:35.89]Don't be an idiot.
[71:50.42]Alright, I feel like I'm playing Condemned.
[71:54.95]Where's the guy that's gonna run around the corner?
[71:57.43]The 2x4.
[71:59.63]With a big tray.
[72:10.86]Oh!
[72:11.56]Oh, it's a... Okay.
[72:13.18]I'm fine.
[72:13.70]I'm fine.
[72:14.86]A pipe?
[72:15.26]No, I want the crutch.
[72:17.70]I can't help two items.
[72:19.74]Just put one down your pants.
[72:23.06]Like, slide the pipe down your, like, back or front of your underwear.
[72:26.63]What do you mean?
[72:27.19]You don't have a pocket or something?
[72:28.23]Just take it.
[72:28.71]You might need it.
[72:38.41]Dual welding?
[72:43.51]Sorry, wielding.
[72:44.81]Dual wielding.
[72:47.73]Can I go down here?
[72:48.39]I feel like I'm not supposed to be over here.
[72:56.33]Oh, yes I am.
[72:57.27]Alright, checkpoint.
[73:01.17]Detective Tapp is almost here to release you.
[73:04.71]He is faster than I anticipated.
[73:07.25]Tapp?
[73:07.59]The cop that's been chasing you and interrogating me?
[73:10.69]Why?
[73:12.27]He is here to face his obsession and to make a choice.
[73:17.05]Is this her?
[73:18.25]I got the fuse.
[73:20.49]Darkness also illuminates.
[73:42.21]I guess, I don't know, writing poetry?
[73:44.27]What does that mean?
[73:50.48]Dude, one time, did I talk about this before?
[73:52.52]I was in the store, this was like a year or two ago.
[73:56.46]I was in the store and there was poetry books on the shelf.
[73:59.92]I've talked about this before?
[74:01.12]Have we?
[74:04.30]Where, it's, okay, it's a poetry book.
[74:06.82]The book is probably, can't be more than 50 or 60 pages.
[74:12.69]And I don't know if this is supposed to be for, like, aesthetic reasons.
[74:15.57]I don't know.
[74:16.03]I was trying to figure it out.
[74:17.89]Half of the pages, the poems were one or two sentences, and it took up the whole paper.
[74:24.96]It was just, like, the entire page was, like, one sentence.
[74:28.78]And then, like, the next page was, like, three sentences.
[74:30.83]Next page, one sentence.
[74:36.31]No, it wasn't a kid's book.
[74:42.71]YouTuber poems?
[74:46.26]Oh, well, this is... What's this?
[74:49.54]Wait.
[74:50.54]I have a fuse.
[74:51.04]Is it gonna deactivate them?
[74:54.92]Alright, I did it.
[74:58.33]The room has been deactivated.
[75:01.35]Or something.
[75:04.93]Oh, what is this?
[75:05.53]A pinata?
[75:08.81]Don't do it.
[75:09.53]How far back will it put me?
[75:10.61]Oh.
[75:15.70]It's gonna be, uh, audio tape.
[75:17.16]Here we go.
[75:17.66]The key to any puzzle lies in its pieces.
[75:22.04]Sometimes you have to look at a problem for a completely different... But it's here?
[75:25.46]Sometimes you need to search to find the obvious.
[75:31.48]He's in the room.
[75:36.44]Sometimes you need to search the room to find the obvious, detective.
[75:42.10]Please do, because I kinda trapped myself in here.
[75:46.38]And I forgot which one I turned on first.
[75:49.62]I've been here for a few hours.
[75:51.62]If you could get us both out of here, that would be great.
[75:59.95]Sure thing, Jigsaw.
[76:00.65]I'll take care of it.
[76:04.07]It's in a baby unit.
[76:05.42]It's in a baby unit.
[76:19.55]Did I do?
[76:22.19]He wired that wrong.
[76:23.35]That was... He fucked up the wiring.
[76:30.63]You let him down.
[76:32.09]I just got it.
[76:33.39]I... What?
[76:53.44]No, I pressed A on this thing.
[77:01.06]Okay, it's in- what about- fuck the puzzle.
[77:03.54]It's in the gun draw.
[77:08.42]Oh, it's the fuse box.
[77:13.42]It's this one.
[77:14.84]Oh, I got the coupler.
[77:15.54]Okay, cool.
[77:16.86]Now you have 12 seconds.
[77:20.24]Wait, the audio tape!
[77:22.04]Give me the audio tape, quick!
[77:38.75]Too many people.
[77:42.07]I didn't even install the fuse box.
[77:46.42]Is that gonna be bad?
[77:48.77]Wait, I blew up the room first.
[77:54.71]It was like lights on the wall.
[77:57.87]Wait, hold on.
[77:58.37]There's a secret entrance.
[77:59.05]There's a bomb right there.
[78:14.84]What's wrong?
[78:15.20]What's going on with this one?
[78:22.93]Bat.
[78:23.27]Yup!
[78:27.21]Drink it.
[78:30.62]Alright, can I even do this?
[78:32.80]I didn't break the whole game, did I?
[78:42.64]Is it broken?
[78:43.10]I don't think I was supposed to do this yet.
[78:55.12]Didn't get the fuse yet.
[78:56.84]Oh.
[79:00.91]Where the fuck is the- Oh!
[79:03.37]Right, okay.
[79:05.49]Now I see what you're- Now I see what you're understanding here.
[79:07.91]Okay.
[79:09.43]Go.
[79:14.18]Did I just get it?
[79:14.64]I just picked it up.
[79:27.90]What the fuck is happening right now?
[79:30.64]Okay, it's lit up.
[79:32.44]Now I have to follow the path.
[79:39.72]He was on battery acid when he did this.
[79:43.94]How did he get on the ceiling?
[79:50.27]Well, this is like you didn't even try.
[79:52.03]This is not even right.
[79:53.65]Is that supposed to fuck with me?
[80:00.23]I don't even know what he's talking about So what I have to connect the line with your eyes And then the door will present itself
[80:32.79]It's the gun.
[80:34.29]Yeah, okay.
[80:34.79]Well, I'm already way ahead of this.
[80:36.57]My IQ is too high.
[80:38.80]I did this.
[80:39.50]I already got that.
[80:41.20]I already did this.
[80:42.04]I did it.
[80:42.46]I opened the gun.
[80:44.56]I did this backwards.
[80:45.52]I did this in reverse.
[80:46.90]So where do I go?
[80:47.58]What did I just get?
[80:48.28]What do I have?
[80:48.80]Holy shit, I can't believe you did this fucking whole thing backwards.
[80:55.63]What is it?
[80:55.95]Pick up what?
[80:58.85]A crutch.
[81:01.74]What did I get for doing this?
[81:02.76]Another fuse box?
[81:05.68]Back up to the ladder.
[81:06.52]Does this game suck?
[81:09.80]Anybody know?
[81:14.95]Oh, I got the cu- Right, right, right, right.
[81:16.59]The coupler.
[81:17.13]The coupler.
[81:18.45]Who the fuck is this guy?
[81:28.79]Hey!
[81:28.97]Come here!
[81:32.76]Watch out, there's glass!
[81:33.64]Get over here.
[81:35.80]I'm coming up there!
[81:36.60]What?
[81:36.74]Why is he waiting?
[81:37.40]Wait, why did I do that?
[81:42.20]Are you alright?
[82:14.92]Oh my god, that was right in the fucking mouth.
[82:18.80]And I didn't even say anything.
[82:19.96]This is... Holy shit.
[82:26.89]Okay.
[82:28.59]Wait.
[82:29.87]You just have to unbolt the door, dude.
[82:35.27]You just have to unbolt.
[82:36.37]Oh, you could have been my friend.
[82:38.14]We could have gone together.
[82:40.02]I could have had a person with me.
[82:44.34]It's dead.
[82:45.80]Holy shit, that was unbelievably horrible.
[82:49.39]Okay, what's in the box?
[82:52.05]Oh, nothing in the box.
[82:52.83]Just the thing that goes... Alright, I have the coupler.
[83:07.14]Now what?
[83:39.97]I got it.
[83:40.45]Everybody fucking relax.
[83:46.75]Relax.
[83:47.29]Relax.
[83:48.01]It took me like not even 60 seconds.
[83:54.11]Floor of the office?
[84:00.43]What office?
[84:01.49]This one?
[84:01.73]All right.
[84:02.53]Press the button.
[84:06.74]Okay.
[84:10.36]I got an exit.
[84:21.08]How do I get over there?
[84:27.19]Where are you going?
[84:27.79]I don't know.
[84:28.83]Where am I going?
[84:30.51]What do I just do?
[84:34.11]Can I move this?
[84:34.89]Can I drag this out of the way?
[84:43.67]Oh, there we go.
[84:45.47]Sick.
[84:46.51]Oh, look at that.
[84:47.27]Sick.
[84:58.10]Checkpoint.
[84:58.60]Alright, I have two nails.
[85:00.58]What do I do with this shit?
[85:02.34]Missed a secret room.
[85:03.26]Secret room.
[85:03.72]Secret room.
[85:07.04]I'm blind.
[85:07.76]Oh, I'm alright.
[85:11.76]I still, what do I have?
[85:12.38]A person's leg?
[85:15.66]That's a baseball bat, right.
[85:16.68]Okay, let's keep going.
[85:17.40]Glass?
[85:20.46]Who's making that noise?
[85:22.35]I'm here to rescue you.
[85:25.33]Quick, call the police!
[85:26.07]Make a telephone call, now!
[85:34.63]Wait, somebody in there?
[85:35.28]Is somebody in this room?
[85:44.43]Did I save you?
[85:53.42]Aren't you the police?
[85:54.80]Am I?
[85:55.10]Wait, I'm the police.
[85:59.54]Oh, shit.
[86:01.90]Pick up pipe.
[86:02.65]No, bat.
[86:03.97]That's way better.
[86:04.83]No, pipe has more slots left.
[86:09.40]Dude, I'm telling you, man.
[86:10.26]I find somebody, I do a full combo, full five slot, eviscerate on somebody.
[86:14.43]Whoa.
[86:15.27]That'll do probably 700 damage and a crit.
[86:17.15]Yellow numbers.
[86:20.89]Whatever.
[86:27.26]And there's a wow reference.
[86:28.20]Fuck it.
[86:28.48]Whatever.
[86:32.93]Who's this guy?
[86:33.79]He's superhuman.
[86:34.63]Barricade.
[86:35.13]Sometimes a bolted door is not enough.
[86:36.93]Keep enemies from breaking through a closed and bolted door.
[86:39.15]Move something heavy in front of the door.
[86:41.35]A. I have a pipe.
[86:42.49]Just hit him in the head.
[86:45.45]Just fucking hit him.
[86:46.22]What do you mean you have to do this?
[86:50.52]What do you have to do?
[86:53.12]Well, come in.
[87:03.46]Thanks for the free item, you fucking idiot.
[87:08.54]Quick, block the door.
[87:09.50]Barricade the door.
[87:10.28]I get the tutorial message.
[87:16.20]One of us... What if he had... He may have had something very important to tell me.
[87:22.04]Okay, move it back.
[87:27.98]I didn't get no tutorial.
[87:30.61]I have to do this.
[87:35.07]Oh, he didn't spend very much time trying to kill me.
[87:36.81]That's encouraging.
[87:44.37]Checking.
[87:45.25]Why am I checking for items?
[87:46.38]Who cares?
[87:46.96]Just beat it.
[87:47.66]Just beat the game.
[87:48.26]This game's probably like three hours long.
[87:52.36]Okay, what's the percentage chance that this is longer than the movie?
[87:57.02]Is this game's story mode longer than the movie that it's based on?
[88:05.13]We'll find out.
[88:06.55]And I just probably play it for like three or four hours and never play this ever again.
[88:10.75]We'll see.
[88:11.07]I'm never going to see this game again.
[88:13.45]Yeah, that's a guarantee.
[88:20.88]That only happens if you die without having being signed in.
[88:24.42]Yeah.
[88:26.58]Wait.
[88:27.44]Oh, just... Alright, take some.
[88:40.27]For the amount of health that I have, and the amount of danger I've potentially been in, I feel like insane probably wouldn't be that insane.
[88:48.36]Alright, let's go.
[88:52.96]What the fuck?
[88:56.06]Getting a good gamer score from this?
[88:57.43]Okay, in here?
[89:00.87]What's over there?
[89:02.55]I don't know.
[89:05.41]What is that?
[89:07.57]What is this?
[89:07.91]Have I been in here?
[89:09.82]What is this?
[89:12.72]Headphones.
[89:13.10]Is this the person on the drugs?
[89:16.32]Okay.
[89:37.26]Hurry, or she will join the fate of your lead partner.
[89:40.24]You've made it this far to get the minor prize.
[89:46.22]Take these Bose headphones and leave.
[89:50.44]Or go on a vacation to Hawaii.
[89:54.40]Make your choice.
[89:57.52]Mm-mm.
[90:01.16]Mm.
[90:05.63]I want that fucking vacation.
[90:07.85]Let's go.
[90:14.34]Ooh, there's a key in there.
[90:17.60]It's sitting on the table.
[90:18.74]Wow, I can just go in and grab it.
[90:22.66]Uh-oh.
[90:25.02]It's not gonna be that easy.
[90:28.73]Crap.
[90:53.18]Okay, we need to find the code for the door.
[90:54.60]Nothing in the cabinet.
[90:58.32]Oh, shit.
[90:59.56]Um... It's a fuse box.
[91:05.13]Okay, fuse.
[91:08.75]Fuse!
[91:14.67]Did I do it?
[91:16.77]Now what?
[91:18.87]Five, seven, nine.
[91:22.02]Quickly, hurry up!
[91:24.79]Five.
[91:27.05]Seven.
[91:27.43]Go backwards!
[91:30.44]Still gonna blow up?
[91:40.68]Uh-oh.
[91:45.31]No, no, no boss fight.
[91:48.19]Now I'm in another room.
[91:51.81]TVs and bombs.
[91:56.91]That's all this guy's got.
[91:58.77]You got a surplus of old televisions and bombs.
[92:02.41]Can you rescue her?
[92:05.56]Detective Tap?
[92:07.38]Question mark.
[92:11.96]Can you?
[92:12.30]Took a lot of yard sales for you to get all these TVs, Jigsaw.
[92:30.03]I mean, that's known.
[92:31.94]Where'd you get all the bombs?
[92:38.56]I don't understand.
[92:40.22]Where do you get them?
[92:41.32]Where would he build them?
[92:48.61]Until now, the Jigsaw Killer has never left anyone alive.
[92:51.43]Amanda Young is now the first and only known survivor of the Jigsaw Killer.
[92:55.37]Details about Young are forthcoming.
[92:57.16]She is to make a statement regarding her capture.
[93:01.97]He saved my life.
[93:02.78]These are the words spoken by Amanda Young, only known survivor of the jigsaw killer.
[93:06.26]I mean, at what point, hold on, do we know, at what point, where does it think we know in the story?
[93:10.11]Because this is just Saw.
[93:15.77]I think, no, this takes place, we have seen Saw 6 at this point.
[93:21.15]Or Saw 5.
[93:22.31]Because there's a trailer for Saw 6 on the disc.
[93:25.68]I remember seeing it.
[93:27.18]So it assumes we've seen all five Saw movies.
[93:30.26]So just want to make sure you guys are aware there's probably going to be some spoilers for Saws 1 through 5.
[93:34.18]I mean, I already know.
[93:43.35]Maybe you do.
[93:43.79]I don't know.
[93:44.09]Do you?
[93:46.78]We had Chiyo Chan give five community subs.
[93:50.02]Thank you.
[93:50.90]We also had $50 come in.
[93:54.01]It was 5,000 bits earlier that I missed.
[93:56.67]I'm a terrible streamer.
[93:57.69]I'm very bad at everything that I do.
[93:59.25]I mean, you new viewers that are here right now, I might just skip over your $50 donation.
[94:04.47]I just want to make sure we're aware of that, apparently.
[94:08.30]It's Green Templar.
[94:10.16]Thanks for the fucking huge amount of money.
[94:14.40]They say, German, I want to say thank you for the entertainment you've given me.
[94:16.54]You're so unique and have... Oh, look it, I'm fucking unique.
[94:19.76]Really innovated the streaming formula with your comedy and your creative use of the tools available to you.
[94:25.35]I do have one request, though, if you can.
[94:27.41]I really like when you play strategy games and really recommend you play Total War Warhammer 2 as the rats.
[94:33.57]It fits your theme and I think it would be fun for a stream.
[94:35.57]Stay safe.
[94:37.21]Um, I think I've completely given up on ever doing anything that has to do with managing, like, 2,000 units over the course of a giant map that I have to feed units and do diplomacy and shit.
[94:49.32]I don't think I'll ever do it again.
[94:50.82]I had an absolute mess of a time trying to play something like Mountain Blade, and then people were like, hey, you should try Crusader Kings, and I'm like, nope.
[94:58.96]Is this like Crusader Kings?
[95:04.85]Shove?
[95:05.17]What the fuck?
[95:08.90]It's different.
[95:09.58]I don't want to watch this fucking show.
[95:11.96]I'm here.
[95:12.28]I'm here.
[95:12.54]I'm here.
[95:54.43]How am I gonna get injected?
[95:56.47]Oh shit!
[96:28.41]Wait, I'm to do it.
[96:30.97]Wait, what?
[96:32.17]Why would you do this?
[96:35.11]What the fuck did I do?
[96:37.01]Holy shit, what a fucking idiot he actually did.
[96:43.76]Alright, antidote.
[96:44.62]Hey, breathe in the antidote.
[96:46.20]Okay, antidote going in.
[96:58.51]Toxic, being released.
[97:04.74]Antidote.
[97:06.68]Antidote, go that way.
[97:07.96]And then, antidote.
[97:10.18]All right, antidote going in.
[97:15.45]Bingo, did I win?
[97:23.87]I just made us way more powerful.
[97:26.05]Look at that heartbeat now.
[97:28.20]We have the heartbeat of a small fish.
[97:30.00]Alright, antidote.
[97:36.67]Toxin.
[97:37.11]Yeah, get the toxin out of here.
[97:41.41]We don't dump that that way.
[97:44.41]I'm gonna give you more of that toxin.
[97:47.10]Wait, and then put the antidote over here.
[97:48.86]Look, Jigsaw, you didn't really explain the rules very well.
[97:54.83]Ain't it though?
[97:56.46]Okay, I think we're safe now.
[98:26.37]I'm still alive!
[98:31.20]Does it match the color?
[98:33.44]What do you mean, match the color?
[98:35.68]Sorry, I was talking.
[98:36.34]I was talking over the cutscene.
[98:42.12]Is he gonna explain it again?
[98:52.35]Red left, blue right.
[98:57.60]I wasn't paying any attention at all, like zero.
[99:00.30]I was looking at chat and like talking about stuff.
[99:04.68]Red left, blue right.
[99:27.34]He literally said it.
[99:34.24]He literally said it.
[99:36.66]Red left, blue right.
[99:38.90]Alright, what's coming out first?
[99:46.11]I wanted to put it to the left.
[99:49.19]I wasn't trying to make it go right.
[99:52.83]Red left.
[99:54.89]Okay, blue right.
[100:01.80]Okay, red left.
[100:06.78]This is fucking... It's just... I'm trying to... No, why is it doing... I'm trying to go the other way!
[100:19.27]It's just putting them down auto... Free stuff fucking thing.
[100:28.75]You made the blue go... I didn't do anything!
[100:30.77]It's just automatically doing the... Can I move the device?
[100:40.41]Okay, blue goes right.
[100:43.60]So I'm gonna do... It's gonna go... So we're gonna go... Let's go.
[100:49.14]Put it down there.
[100:56.40]You're thinking too far ahead.
[101:02.30]This jigsaw, your puzzle's dumb.
[101:05.16]I can, what?
[101:05.78]Can't I just like dig my hands through like my Play-Doh insides to find the fucking device?
[101:10.37]Why do we have to do this?
[101:11.03]I don't want to do this.
[101:15.47]Okay, now, blue.
[101:21.21]Okay.
[101:22.76]Red.
[101:24.48]Red?
[101:24.72]No, blue.
[101:26.66]Blue.
[101:28.04]Blue.
[101:34.91]Okay, now blue!
[101:36.19]Now red!
[101:38.27]Blue!
[101:42.15]Okay, now blue again!
[101:43.89]Blue!
[101:46.39]Oh shit!
[101:51.20]Hold on, is this just as stupid as just... Just alternate them every time?
[101:58.18]Am I overthinking this like crazy right now?
[102:00.38]Is it just alternate every time and that's it?
[102:07.08]have what why have a puzzle are you no it's not that's it's not that simple is it oh my god it's actually that simple okay now we go no it's not it's not that simple the fucking thing's moved fuck

[102:37.38]Okay, now we gotta go, um, blue again.
[102:42.96]No, no!
[102:44.38]What happened?
[102:44.98]What the fuck is happening right now?
[102:46.51]What?
[102:47.79]Oh, boy.
[102:48.81]This is, it's storing, she's dead.
[102:56.11]Oh, fuck.
[102:56.97]This is bad.
[102:57.59]I don't, uh, I'm just gonna wait till you guys tell me what to do.
[102:59.70]I'm not even kidding.
[103:00.88]What do I do?
[103:03.06]I'm not even going to press any buttons until you say it.
[103:04.50]Whatever it is.
[103:06.06]Blue.
[103:08.18]Okay.
[103:08.92]Uh, now what?

[103:13.52]Red?
[103:16.81]You fucking assholes.
[103:17.59]You lied to me.
[103:18.19]She's dead.
[103:18.81]Do it again.
[103:19.33]Oh my god.
[103:19.83]This sucks.
[103:28.80]This actually sucks.
[103:30.74]I don't want to do this.
[103:32.18]I'm gonna only listen to you.
[103:33.66]Alright, is there a mod in the chat right now?
[103:37.90]Is there a mod in the chat?
[103:40.97]I'm gonna only- I want one mod to tell me how to beat this.
[103:43.47]Okay, it's just alternate only.
[103:44.89]So it's just blue, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue.
[103:47.93]Just go.
[104:04.70]You have to start storing them and shit.
[104:18.29]Okay.
[104:21.95]No mods.
[104:24.03]Uh-oh.
[104:27.09]Uh-oh.
[104:37.63]okay so um here we go okay blue blue first and then now it's gonna be uh blue again right can I pause it okay if the game's stupid I can pause it now no it's red
[105:08.64]Okay.
[105:09.16]Now, we've got a double scenario here.
[105:11.08]Now we do... Blue.
[105:14.32]Twice.
[105:15.26]Blue twice.
[105:16.48]Blue twice.
[105:20.41]Blue twice.
[105:21.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[105:22.49]Red.
[105:29.23]Then... Red again.
[105:31.67]No.
[105:31.97]Blue.
[105:32.89]No.
[105:33.33]No.
[105:34.77]Blue again.

[105:36.19]Blue here.
[105:39.68]Okay, now red.
[105:44.07]Okay, now blue.
[105:47.43]Okay, now red.
[105:57.59]Okay, now blue.
[106:05.53]Okay, now red.
[106:10.37]Okay, now blue.
[106:13.89]Okay, now red.
[106:14.59]Okay, now blue.
[106:22.24]It was just the same thing again.
[106:26.31]I overthought the fuck out of that.
[106:29.37]That was the most overthinking ever.
[106:32.27]Me too!
[106:32.51]Ooh, damaged goods.
[107:03.39]Chapter 1 complete.
[107:04.37]I thought this said, eat light source.
[107:10.36]Why?
[107:10.64]Party member.
[107:16.32]I can't wait until she walks through one of these and gets killed.
[107:34.45]Play by the rules, and we both might make it.
[107:38.49]He's watching.
[107:40.35]You've already survived one trap by him.
[107:42.89]How can you- Clearly, I failed the test, though.
[107:45.98]That's why he brought me back here, and with a fucking cop, no less.
[107:49.50]Just be sure of this.
[107:50.90]Jigsaw's in control, not you, detective.
[108:00.34]Okay.
[108:01.52]Knock it off.
[108:05.77]I just needed to know if you could... She died?
[108:11.15]You don't... Can I kill her?
[108:15.09]Oh, he's in control, huh?
[108:18.31]Oh.
[108:26.88]Nothing in there.
[108:29.36]I am in control.
[108:32.42]Uh-oh!
[108:34.00]I found a clue over here!
[108:47.83]Can I do anything with this?
[108:51.06]Back up, back up, back up, back the fuck up.
[108:52.58]I got a lighter.
[108:56.98]You're wasting durability.
[108:58.02]Yeah, you're right.
[109:04.42]Your obsession with me has destroyed your own life and driven you here, like a rat escaping the heat of the sun.
[109:13.07]I think you know someone down here.
[109:15.47]Your old friend from the Force, Jennings Foster.
[109:19.48]You might want to ask him what really happened in that hidden run case you two worked on.
[109:25.86]Alright, Jigsaw, open the door.
[109:28.44]A little too long winded here.
[109:31.62]Let's go.
[109:32.14]Wait!
[109:32.92]Help!
[109:34.07]I'm coming!
[109:34.75]I'm here!
[109:36.35]You're still with me, right?
[109:37.23]Okay.
[109:58.31]Nothing in that work table.
[110:00.33]Pick up.
[110:00.65]What is it?
[110:02.37]A mop handle.
[110:03.47]Oh, absolutely.
[110:04.21]Here.
[110:05.03]I'll trade.
[110:05.59]There we go.
[110:08.09]Hey!
[110:08.35]Help!
[110:08.73]Help me!
[110:08.99]Someone!
[110:23.25]Do you think the man you killed cried for help the same way
[110:27.90]What is he on?
[110:29.08]This really could be Kylo Ren.
[110:30.76]It's like the same lines.
[110:32.08]Can I give her a weapon?
[110:33.64]I really mean this.
[111:01.14]I can't give you anything.
[111:02.26]Why can't I give you something?
[111:06.82]I hope he says the word.
[111:08.07]Look out!
[111:14.59]Behind you!
[111:18.21]He's electrocuting her?
[111:27.65]Okay, well, I'm glad I don't have to worry about another person.
[111:30.81]That would've been a pain in the ass.
[111:34.65]Has there been anything in any of these draws ever?
[111:36.60]The whole time we played?
[111:37.40]What's the point of this stuff?
[111:38.54]Just here.
[111:40.78]Alright, stay calm.
[111:52.77]Friend.
[111:54.01]Or enemy.
[111:56.03]I don't know.
[111:56.35]I didn't have a chance to determine who that was.
[111:59.05]Alright, watch out.
[112:03.15]This is a tank that... Okay, find the boiler room key.
[112:10.39]Go in the acid.
[112:11.91]Uh-oh.
[112:13.85]No, I don't want to just reach in the acid!
[112:17.45]Why did I do this?
[112:20.30]Why did I do that?
[112:21.52]There's nothing in here.
[112:22.92]Oh.
[112:23.02]Wait.
[112:23.24]Can I open this too?
[112:24.54]Live or die.
[112:49.72]Live or die live or die find the find the find the find the find the truth find the truth truth truth truth truth Find the remix What does that mean
[113:17.86]Body bag, shotgun shell, and trip wire.
[113:20.57]Ooh, I get a shotgun?
[113:22.13]I get a gun?
[113:25.27]I hope I get a gun.
[113:27.09]Even walking can be dangerous in Jigsaw's world.
[113:28.93]Watch the ground for shotgun trip wires.
[113:31.39]And disable them before they go off.
[113:32.51]You can also rearm these to use against enemies.
[113:34.66]Oh.
[113:36.36]What's right here?
[113:36.90]Okay, well how do I turn it off?
[113:42.22]How do I turn it off?
[113:45.94]Oh, okay.
[113:51.88]So... Alright, now... Arm it... Wait.
[113:57.42]Now arm it while I'm across it.
[113:58.74]Okay.
[114:04.41]I'm gonna forget that that's there.
[114:06.37]But... Try to remind me.
[114:11.85]That almost blew my fucking head off.
[114:13.77]Okay.
[114:20.07]That was close.
[114:21.33]I'm not gonna lie.
[114:29.07]See the janitor about the steam.
[114:32.79]I need a wheel.
[114:35.22]The way forward will be your first challenge in reaching your friend.
[114:40.04]The steam from these pipes will kill you.
[114:42.78]Why?
[114:43.32]Find a way to redirect it.
[114:45.32]Or your life and everyone else's here will be forfeited.
[114:51.77]What's the thing with steam hurting you and killing you and stuff?
[114:53.89]You're telling me that you can't just, like, fall sprint and, like, slide underneath that?
[114:59.76]Just take your shirt and, like, cover your head and stuff and just run, sprint, slide.
[115:03.78]It's hot.
[115:05.58]Yeah?
[115:06.70]Slide under and just sprint as fast as you can.
[115:09.02]You'll get, like, a little bit on you.
[115:19.41]It sticks to you.
[115:22.82]I'm sure you know that one of the seals broke today near the boiler.
[115:25.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[115:29.23]Keep the boiler pressure next time.
[115:31.27]Seal breaks might kill someone.
[115:32.67]Yeah.
[115:32.89]Well, you didn't tell me where the wheel was.
[115:41.96]Is this the game's excuse to just get you?
[115:44.78]I don't understand why I keep doing it.
[115:52.57]I feel like that's the game telling me I was out of bounds for too long.
[115:55.49]What?
[115:56.61]Escape the bathroom.
[116:01.73]Uh...
[116:28.97]what are the rules what's the rule book darkness illuminates all right put down the darkness illuminates uh-huh all right turn the light off light switch be in this toilet over here
[116:53.64]More needles.
[116:57.66]How did he get all these needles?
[117:00.84]Okay, got the key.
[117:06.54]Is that the key to the helmet?
[117:13.54]Now what?
[117:13.86]Okay.
[117:16.54]Rescue.
[117:17.80]Go to the janitor's office.
[117:18.87]Okay.
[117:20.69]And in his office.
[117:21.31]It's this way.
[117:21.77]Where's that bomb?
[117:23.95]Where's that tripwire?
[117:26.13]It's over here, right?
[117:27.65]No, it's not.
[117:28.09]Where is it?
[117:32.52]Is it right here?
[117:33.18]Where's that tripwire?
[117:36.98]I don't know where it is.
[117:45.07]Your shotgun collar reacts to specific enemies with shotgun collars.
[117:49.97]When you get near one of these enemies, the lights on the back of your collar will blink.
[117:53.71]The closer the enemy... The closer the enemy, the faster the blinking, and the faster your own collar will detonate.
[118:00.93]Try to stay far away from enemies with collars.
[118:03.09]If you keep your distance long enough, the enemy collar will explode and deactivate.
[118:09.11]Ah!
[118:09.35]Don't come near me, man!
[118:10.87]Get away from me!
[118:12.29]Get away from me!
[118:12.83]Get away, get away!
[118:17.08]Don't you know what these things are?
[118:18.12]You fucking idiot!
[118:20.10]Stop!
[118:20.52]Leave me alone!
[118:22.88]Bolt the door!
[118:23.38]Alright, get fucked.
[118:38.57]Dead?
[118:39.91]Wait, but his collar's still on the ground.
[118:41.23]Where is he?
[118:47.30]I got his- wait, is- oh, there he is.
[118:50.86]I was gonna say this is his arm.
[118:53.34]Oh, this is where he explains it.
[119:16.39]Okay, pick this lock.
[119:20.69]Oh crap, I can't do that.
[119:21.85]Oh, what am I doing?
[119:30.87]I want to select this one.
[119:35.74]The numbers, Jeremy, what do they mean?
[119:37.26]I don't know.
[119:38.72]It's just shit.
[119:42.61]Unlock.
[119:43.41]Jigsaw chest.
[119:45.44]Gear.
[119:46.66]A nail.
[119:48.10]What's in the jigsaw chest?
[119:51.98]Oh boy, um... Wait, I have to... Uh...
[120:26.70]I didn't know there were other sizes.
[120:27.72]Alright, there's this huge... Come on, you motherfucker.
[121:05.39]How far on do I have to go?
[121:29.43]Got it.
[121:29.69]Doctor's brain's too big.
[121:33.33]Shotgun shell, tripwire, and bandages.
[121:37.07]Excellent.
[121:40.13]Oh, got it.
[121:40.61]Alright, now we gotta go... We have to go... The way that guy came.
[122:00.26]Bathtub over here.
[122:01.00]Probably a dead body in it.
[122:04.12]Search the area to find the valve wheel.
[122:06.65]Ooh, no, I want the person's hand.
[122:07.91]It's way cooler.
[122:13.27]Storage.
[122:17.87]Ooh.
[122:18.55]Is a baseball bat in here?
[122:20.09]What do I care?
[122:20.53]I don't care.
[122:20.89]Nothing.
[122:23.10]Can I break this wall?
[122:28.70]No.
[122:32.26]Need a hand, Jeremy?
[122:35.33]Why didn't you do the Pepe laugh thing?
[122:38.63]Why would you write that and not write Pepe laugh?
[122:42.09]Have you ever been on the internet before?
[122:43.14]Come on.
[122:49.02]The wheel is nearby.
[122:50.58]It's probably right behind this.
[122:52.72]It's probably behind the chalkboard.
[122:54.04]Hmm.
[122:58.73]No.
[123:01.93]Bruh.
[123:03.23]Wow.
[123:03.61]I almost just walked right into that.
[123:06.85]Okay.
[123:07.97]That would have been bad.
[123:09.07]I'm knocking.
[123:09.73]I can't see that shit.
[123:12.90]How am I supposed to reliably see those?
[123:18.44]Bolted.
[123:18.86]Oh, there it is.
[123:22.62]Nothing.
[123:23.74]Wait, what was in there?
[123:24.36]I don't know.
[123:25.30]Crip wire.
[123:25.72]Okay.
[123:27.66]That's the point.
[123:31.47]No one's even hurt me.
[123:33.88]I'm untouchable.
[123:35.62]Yeah, I gotta get this open.
[123:46.78]Into the utility room.
[123:51.97]What the hell did that just say?
[123:54.01]What did that just say?
[123:55.93]What did that just say?
[123:56.79]That was a huge amount of text.
[123:59.13]What did it say?
[124:03.68]Oh, I think that guy died.
[124:14.46]Whoa, what is this?
[124:15.08]Probably said don't touch electricity.
[124:23.05]Table lamp.
[124:25.11]No, I want the... I want the wooden leg.
[124:31.38]They call these people insane, but I don't see that.
[124:33.30]Somebody else will read this screenshot and look at it.
[124:37.70]Who the fuck are these guys?
[124:42.39]What?
[124:42.55]There you are?
[124:44.83]Where am I?
[124:45.53]Who are you?
[124:45.93]Who is me?
[125:22.14]Come over here!
[125:24.80]Did you see it?
[125:26.54]He sees it!
[125:27.32]What the fuck?!
[125:36.48]He doesn't see it, does he?
[125:44.81]I crit this guy.
[125:45.69]Nice.
[125:48.41]Alright, how do I get this guy to come over here?
[125:50.63]Come over here!
[125:52.95]Hey!
[125:55.76]This way!
[126:03.53]Where is he?
[126:07.31]Where is he?
[126:10.23]Fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
[126:11.01]Okay, hold on.
[126:11.78]Here we go.
[126:24.18]Oh my god, that was fuckin' horrible.
[126:28.21]Well, I got him.
[126:34.19]Turn that off, don't die.
[126:35.17]There's, uh, I think there was another wire here, or a shell.
[126:38.99]That I couldn't get before because I had full inventory.
[126:40.87]I don't think it matters.
[126:43.35]Oh, it don't fuckin' matter.
[126:50.65]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[126:54.62]whole nails.

[127:01.66]Yeah, it's time to pick up the table lamp.
[127:03.20]You're right.
[127:06.92]Found nothing.
[127:11.19]Wait.
[127:12.27]Nothing.
[127:12.63]Why are they still lit up?
[127:13.49]What is this?
[127:16.87]Okay.
[127:21.55]Now I get the hell out of here.
[127:22.59]I go, um...
[127:27.66]Uh, where?
[127:28.34]This way?
[127:30.00]Wait, what did he have?
[127:32.90]Oh, he's a mop hand.
[127:37.07]I got the wheel.
[127:39.59]Back to the steam room.
[127:42.05]Just down.
[127:45.03]Okay, just making sure he didn't stand up.
[127:55.70]This guy got out.
[127:56.40]How did this guy get out of this chamber?
[128:01.32]This guy... I keep getting achievements.
[128:12.58]Wait, is that thing gonna explode?
[128:21.94]Okay, that was... Wait, I think I ran out of material.
[128:25.45]He's really dead.
[128:26.55]Yeah, he's very dead.
[128:27.73]Okay, steam room.
[128:44.09]This way?
[128:44.55]There's electricity everywhere over here.
[128:57.01]What room am I even in?
[128:58.17]What is this place?
[128:58.83]Did I turn... Turn it off.
[129:05.89]I just found, like, a new area.
[129:12.27]Diffuse?
[129:12.77]Take it.
[129:18.77]This is Joe Biden gameplay.
[129:20.49]I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[129:24.56]Don't make me steal!
[129:31.23]What is how is that a what do you mean true I I'm just like progressing through the game.
[129:46.53]What are you talking about?
[129:47.55]Please read an important, please read comment
[129:58.82]Please read.
[129:59.10]There's no risk in this game because you aren't actually in danger.
[130:01.36]If you fail in a Jigsaw's games, you die.
[130:03.10]You should have to snap a rubber band against your wrist or pop a balloon next to your ear.
[130:13.95]Why?
[130:15.19]I don't want to do that.
[130:18.03]Oh, fuck that.
[130:19.59]I'm not popping balloons next to my head.
[130:22.67]Alright, where's the steam room?
[130:25.14]Fuck balloons.
[130:31.57]That hurt?
[130:33.43]Wait, why did that hurt so bad?
[130:35.69]Wait, where am I?
[130:36.59]Burn it.
[130:37.69]Spoiler room.
[130:43.82]No escape.
[130:44.54]No escape.
[130:45.38]About like 20 feet.
[130:51.34]It did not fall that far.
[131:02.28]He's an Estus.
[131:03.71]Good.
[131:05.09]Okay.
[131:09.45]Oh, what?
[131:09.83]Okay.
[131:11.07]I don't have a wire.
[131:14.59]What do I do?
[131:14.91]I don't have a wire.
[131:15.37]There's no wire.
[131:19.70]I don't have a wire.
[131:21.30]Got one.
[131:25.42]Okay.
[131:25.60]40 seconds.
[131:26.12]Uh-oh.
[131:27.86]Oh.
[131:39.60]What was the point of... What was the point of me doing that?
[131:41.40]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[131:51.51]How much time?
[131:51.89]We're good.
[132:01.49]Oh, the acid, remember?
[132:02.35]Okay.
[132:06.57]Ernest.
[132:07.47]Boiler room.
[132:14.71]What?
[132:23.04]The tripwire.
[132:25.18]The tripwire from, like, 30 minutes ago, whatever.
[132:34.99]Be fair, though, with me.
[132:36.17]That was a while ago, and... Where the fuck even is that, okay?
[132:40.31]Do you see it on your screen?
[132:42.43]I don't.
[132:44.25]Like, I don't even know where it is now.
[132:45.23]Oh, it's right there.
[132:46.85]Okay.
[132:49.09]That shit wasn't even on the screen.
[132:56.11]Yeah, let's turn the fucking steam on.
[132:58.41]I need two TVs.
[133:13.67]Turn it back on.
[133:14.21]Turn it back on.
[133:14.59]Turn the steam back on.
[133:15.37]Turn the steam back on, then.
[133:17.15]Turn the steam back on.
[133:17.89]If that's the problem.
[133:18.76]Turn the steam back on.
[133:19.42]Can I check this body?
[133:28.22]Oh, shit.
[133:28.64]They're killing each other in there.
[133:31.08]That's my chance.
[133:49.46]Alright, I'm gonna wait till he puts his pacer here and I'm gonna hit him right in the fucking teeth through the door.
[133:52.91]Is he eating him?
[133:54.69]Hey!
[133:55.21]Hey!
[133:57.69]Hey, you!
[134:00.27]I'm talking to you.
[134:00.95]Can I climb through?
[134:03.67]Can I get in here?
[134:08.92]It's open.
[134:11.42]He- He throw grenades?
[134:19.36]Dude, I wish you could just whip shit.
[134:21.52]I would just throw this at this guy's head.
[134:24.06]Okay, well, whatever.
[134:24.90]Let's go.
[134:25.16]We can go up.
[134:28.68]Can't go that way because the steam is there.
[134:30.24]He's eating.
[134:33.14]Well, whatever.
[134:34.36]I'll take him out.
[134:35.32]Just wait until we drop down R1.
[134:47.67]I like you, Germa.
[134:48.51]Thanks.
[134:56.75]What happened in there?
[134:57.31]I don't deserve this.
[135:06.64]Oh, fuck!
[135:07.60]Steam!
[135:08.90]Wait, is that like a fake steam?
[135:10.44]What the hell was that?
[135:13.74]Why did that just pop up for a second?
[135:17.00]Alright, there he is, right?
[135:17.92]He's right here?
[135:19.83]The guy's in here.
[135:20.45]Let's go!
[135:27.17]I have the high ground.
[135:30.35]Don't make this difficult.
[135:32.75]He's got a knife.
[135:35.59]Out of this place.
[135:39.23]Give me the key now.
[135:45.58]No.
[135:48.36]No, fuck you.
[135:49.02]Get away from me.
[135:51.58]Plunging attack.
[135:54.70]Just give me what I want.
[135:56.99]That didn't work.
[136:02.71]Oh no.
[136:03.63]Throw the steam on, quick, burn him.
[136:06.37]Wait, he dropped a knife.
[136:09.26]Wait.
[136:22.83]Why?
[136:23.21]Kill him!
[136:26.83]Is he dead?
[136:31.45]Okay, he's dead.
[136:34.71]I want his knife.
[136:35.51]Where's the knife?
[136:36.15]The knife fell down here.
[136:42.50]Give me that knife.
[136:44.18]It's right there.
[136:47.52]I want that fucking knife!
[136:49.67]The game sucks, whatever.
[136:59.77]Say please?
[137:00.46]This is a real Halloween stream kind of game, don't you think?
[137:05.42]I bet it's late.
[137:07.64]Alright, I made it.
[137:18.76]Like rats in a maze.
[137:20.58]Oh, this is going to be fucking fantastic, isn't it?
[137:22.64]I can't wait.
[137:26.98]Please give me a checkpoint because I know this is going to be horrendous.
[137:37.70]I have a weapon.
[137:44.56]I have a gear.
[137:48.72]So, alright, turn this off.
[137:52.64]Wait, does this make it go?
[137:53.44]Alright, it makes it go this way.
[137:58.32]I gotta follow the rules.
[137:59.14]Let's skip lore.
[138:00.15]Okay, then over here.
[138:02.17]Then... Now what?
[138:19.11]How do I... How the fuck do I get that turned off?
[138:27.06]Run through it.
[138:27.66]I don't think I can.
[138:28.38]I think it's gonna kill me.
[138:29.38]Oh, it says go down.
[138:46.49]5,000 bits and another 50 fucking dollars came in from Fat Batman.
[138:50.06]I like that name.
[138:52.86]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[138:53.80]They say, hey, he said my message chat so he knows I like him more.
[139:00.74]Oh shit, what is this?
[139:06.82]What?
[139:07.72]He said my message so he likes me more.
[139:14.97]Uh...
[139:16.59]Well.
[139:18.71]I mean, everybody eventually is gonna be a one guy.
[139:21.45]You know that.
[139:24.27]Didn't say no.
[139:25.25]I just did.
[139:33.78]Where's your OnlyFans?
[139:36.26]We already went over that.
[139:37.72]That's not- I don't have that.
[139:39.14]What lies beneath?
[139:40.47]Okay, but hold on.
[139:42.31]What's this thing?
[139:46.44]I don't know.
[139:46.78]Let's find out.
[139:48.04]How far of a drop is it?
[139:49.56]Apparently I can't.
[139:52.85]Whatever.
[139:53.13]Alright, less dumbass mazes, more dumbass dialogue, please.
[139:59.33]Come on.
[140:00.31]Give us something to work with.
[140:01.37]Feels bad, man.
[140:17.41]This is a 2.6 maze.
[140:19.81]Is that you making fun of my college GPA?
[140:22.17]What was your college GPA?
[140:29.84]I don't want to do this.
[140:53.99]I don't want to do it.
[140:54.96]I'm done.
[141:43.22]This is a 2.7 puzzle.

[142:03.17]Alright, here they come.
[142:04.05]They're going to be running through.
[142:11.65]The ballroom.
[142:18.90]Wait, I hear them starting and stopping.
[142:24.14]No, I need a checkpoint.
[142:26.12]I'm not doing this yet.
[142:26.88]I'm gonna die.
[142:27.41]This is Super Mario level bullshit.
[142:33.29]No.
[142:33.65]Okay, so go.
[142:41.16]Wait.

[143:36.65]Oh, this became one of the best games ever.
[143:38.89]This game has bricks in it.
[143:41.01]Thank God there's fucking bricks in this game.

[143:52.96]What the fuck just happened?
[144:03.89]Holy shit!
[144:16.36]That was so dumb.
[144:17.54]I have to do this shit again, whatever.

[144:28.20]One in one go, please!
[144:29.28]Oh good, it hit me, but who cares.
[144:32.57]How would that guy be able to see?
[144:34.57]He's chasing me around.
[144:35.94]Oh, come on, man.
[144:55.80]Frank, how hard is this?
[145:05.01]Ow, my chest.
[145:07.77]How would he not get shot by these?
[145:09.57]Don't shoot.

[145:38.51]Oh, god damn it.
[145:40.81]Chest.

[147:48.10]Holy fuck, I almost just walked over that.
[147:49.40]Okay, we're good?
[147:57.01]That's all the traps?
[147:58.37]I got the valve.
[148:01.65]Heal.
[148:08.42]Might as well take them all.
[148:15.44]Oh, please, get out of here.
[148:20.22]What the fuck?
[148:20.98]Alright, which one is it gonna go into?
[148:22.52]I don't know.
[148:23.88]This one, I guess.
[148:27.12]Okay, then down here.
[148:28.18]No.

[153:47.79]Don't go.
[153:48.75]Okay, fine.
[153:50.97]Nice fucking YouTuber reaction there.
[153:59.43]I would say so.
[154:01.43]Okay, now go right.
[154:03.65]And then straight.
[154:04.95]And then... What the hell?
[154:10.88]Uh, okay then.
[154:14.76]Is this, where, am I gonna get hit by this?
[154:16.34]Is that steam?
[154:17.04]I don't know what that is.
[154:19.40]Is that steam?
[154:23.20]Is that gonna kill me?
[154:32.11]I, mmm, I don't wanna walk fucking by it.
[154:34.19]It's gonna hit me.
[154:41.43]Okay, now we're gonna go left.
[154:48.59]Okay, got it.
[154:49.41]And then this way.
[154:51.41]I made it, I win.
[155:03.72]Sick.
[155:04.92]Looks like you were quick enough to save yourself, but...
[155:10.64]Unlock the furnace room.
[155:13.72]I got a checkpoint there.
[155:14.54]That's pretty good.
[155:16.78]Thank God.
[155:17.32]Did I just get locked in?
[155:21.61]Of course I did.
[155:22.49]Alright, you have anything else for me?
[155:28.71]Here we go.
[155:34.74]Rescue Jennings Foster.
[155:36.74]Locate the furnace room.
[155:39.38]That pipe.
[155:39.90]Protect myself.
[155:42.62]Bolt this door.
[155:43.18]Can I?
[155:46.12]Or you'll end up reading this eventually, maybe?
[155:49.96]Wait.
[155:53.58]Hmm.
[155:56.57]Is this a syringe?
[155:58.67]I can syringe people?
[155:59.55]This is pretty awesome, actually.
[156:00.77]Okay.
[156:09.83]No, I'm keeping the syringe.
[156:11.55]Case file.
[156:14.39]If you've lost the stream, just rewind and you can read it.
[156:16.93]I'm going to try to steam clean this something.
[156:19.21]Okay.
[156:28.92]Get the lock.
[156:46.02]I gotta go, but love you, Jeremiah.
[156:48.42]Have a good one.
[156:49.73]Good to see you again.
[156:51.85]Make sure you join us next time.
[156:52.87]There's nothing even in here.
[156:58.78]What a waste of... waste of time.
[157:03.94]Fucking waste of time.
[157:12.50]million viewers are gone.
[157:13.60]Can't be real.
[157:15.08]There's not a million people on Twitch.
[157:17.58]Taking the case file.
[157:24.89]Somebody else will read it.
[157:27.55]Where am I going now?
[157:28.27]Alright.
[157:29.39]I need to go.
[157:32.07]Where am I?
[157:32.63]I'm not even on the map.
[157:33.33]Here I am.
[157:33.65]Here we go.
[157:45.71]Just step on glass.
[157:48.23]Use the- Okay.
[157:49.52]Not bad.
[157:53.58]Not bad for my first day.
[157:55.84]Is that a gun?
[158:18.08]I don't want to syringe you, but I will.
[158:24.36]What's on his head?
[158:26.84]Why does he have a little canister on his head?
[158:29.14]Is the guy going to explode?
[158:30.76]Don't do it.
[158:31.24]Is he?
[158:35.26]I'm safe.
[158:42.94]Okay.
[158:44.74]What does it do?
[158:46.62]Oh, it closed on his head.
[158:49.39]Run.
[158:50.17]Run.
[158:51.85]That was actually horrible.
[158:54.69]I can't believe I just got through that.
[158:55.87]Alright.
[158:57.11]Watch the glass, man.
[158:59.67]I wasn't looking up in the shock.
[159:00.72]I'm going off in my face.
[159:02.92]That's some fucking Tom and Jerry shit right there.
[159:07.32]Let's see if I can get this.
[159:18.56]And...
[159:21.94]Do a Tom and Jerry bit.
[159:26.92]First aid cabinet.
[159:28.18]I don't even need any items.
[159:35.17]What's the point of me doing this?
[159:39.99]Free drugs, I guess.
[159:45.16]Bat?
[159:45.40]Do I still have syringe?
[159:48.18]No.
[159:48.96]One-time use, okay.
[159:55.07]Alright, let's keep going.
[159:57.95]Furnace room this way, and... Here we go.
[160:03.72]What's my next goal?
[160:07.86]TV that will tell me that's not telling me anything.
[160:17.02]No tripwire, right?
[160:18.14]Oh.
[160:25.33]Why are you doing this?
[160:26.99]I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
[160:28.33]It was just... I was in a bar.
[160:30.13]I had to get home.
[160:31.35]He was in the middle of the street.
[160:32.37]Just came right out in front of me.
[160:34.03]I didn't mean to hurt him.
[160:36.35]You framed an innocent man.
[160:39.01]He was a worthless drunk.
[160:40.76]A repeat offender.
[160:42.10]I did the world a favor.
[160:43.62]Justice will be served.
[160:50.52]What's he doing to this guy?
[160:51.80]Is he gonna squish him?
[160:53.12]Okay, here's what I think.
[160:54.30]If I'm a diabolical, sick fuck.
[160:56.48]He's on a plate, and he's gonna just, on a piston, he's gonna squish him up into the ceiling like he's a fly with a fly's water.
[161:02.87]Right?
[161:03.09]It's gonna just slowly go up, and it's gonna scare the shit out of him.
[161:05.83]It's gonna go really fast and stop, and it's gonna, no, no, no, really, really slow.
[161:09.93]Go wicked fast to the ceiling!
[161:11.09]No, here we go.
[161:11.89]I'm gonna pull you back down all the way.
[161:14.25]And you will sit there for like another 40 minutes or so.
[161:16.05]Is this fucked up?
[161:17.63]Is this weird that I'm saying this?
[161:23.70]Does games suck?
[161:29.16]Ooh, a camera!
[161:32.28]Wait.
[161:35.36]Why would you do that into your own eyes?
[161:39.30]Picture is worth a thousand words.
[161:41.96]The picture is, what does it say?
[161:53.68]I don't like that.
[161:55.62]Find the truth.
[161:58.18]It's a pharmaceutical company that's doing evil shit or something.
[162:07.21]No, I don't like that.
[162:08.99]This sucks.
[162:12.37]Give me the lighter instead.
[162:13.33]I'm going to need this though, aren't I?
[162:14.69]But I don't know what that means.
[162:15.75]Am I missing something?
[162:35.90]The fuck is that?
[162:38.10]It's very disorienting.
[162:38.98]Yeah, it is.
[162:42.65]Push and pull your way forward.
[162:45.49]I need to even look at that.
[162:47.49]I can read backwards.
[162:48.35]Can you?
[162:54.40]Use the lighter, please, God.
[162:56.84]I'm going to need this.
[162:58.28]I'll get another lighter.
[162:59.02]Don't worry.
[162:59.66]Push and pull your way forward.
[163:04.04]The pig thing?
[163:07.04]Push and pull.
[163:14.71]Zet.
[163:15.35]E. Puppet.
[163:17.53]I puppet.
[163:18.31]What does it say?
[163:18.71]Alright, let's go.
[163:21.95]I'm going to pull this.
[163:22.81]What does it say?
[163:29.09]Cart.
[163:32.03]I can't pull it or push it?
[163:34.41]Push or pull.
[163:35.06]Your way to...
[163:42.49]I don't know.
[163:45.37]Wait.
[163:45.57]What is it?
[163:53.13]More than two.
[163:53.45]There's a few of these.
[163:54.30]Oh, here we go.
[163:59.08]Oh, it's going to be like that traffic game.
[164:01.08]Mm-hmm.
[164:12.52]Well, that was thankfully easy.
[164:17.88]Who's walking around up there?
[164:20.52]I'm gonna run right for the camera right in the face.
[164:22.05]Hello?
[164:33.35]Anybody coming?
[164:42.57]Hold it from the other side.
[164:43.55]That's going to happen every.
[164:58.94]So glad is an actual checkpoint here.
[165:00.96]Okay.
[165:07.89]It's so dark.
[165:09.61]Even with the flash, I wouldn't have been able to see this shit.
[165:12.36]Where is it?
[165:12.74]Right there.
[165:13.10]There's another one.
[165:19.80]Is it set?
[165:20.66]Wait.
[165:21.14]Set it.
[165:21.36]Okay, set that one.
[165:24.21]Then there's going to be a guy that breaks through and I'm going to run around the circle.
[165:26.61]There he is.
[165:28.01]There's the psycho.
[165:28.67]Right there.
[165:29.35]Oh, the door's open.
[165:32.23]Only one door open.
[165:39.51]Follow me.
[165:46.42]Wait, he didn't... Did he even get hit by the mun that I put?
[165:53.48]He did.
[165:54.26]Wait, I have one minute to do this.
[165:58.14]How do I get this guy to come out?
[165:58.94]56 seconds?
[166:03.34]Wait, why does this guy have a VR helmet on?
[166:15.20]We are both so bad.
[166:20.34]It's like a JRPG.
[166:26.22]Miss!
[166:27.58]Are you fucking kidding me?
[166:30.14]Okay, give me... Wait, he's not dead.
[166:43.63]I think I got him.
[166:45.33]I think I got him.
[166:46.97]Alright.
[166:47.59]How do I get this guy out?
[166:50.01]Eight seconds.
[166:51.05]Until what?
[166:54.11]Eight seconds!
[167:00.70]Wait.
[167:00.96]Until he's released.
[167:05.32]Until what?
[167:09.63]This guy is like worse for wear than everybody else was.
[167:20.48]Is it gonna do anything?
[167:22.80]Okay, I gotta burn his room key.
[167:26.72]Watch out for shotguns.
[167:31.08]Oh, what?

[167:53.34]I mean, holy shit, dude.
[167:54.94]Was that on purpose?
[167:55.66]No.
[167:56.78]I mean, I was trying to... I was trying to... I thought it was A on... I thought it was A on like this.
[168:04.79]On like a cabinet or something.
[168:06.49]I don't know.
[168:06.83]I'm fucking stupid.
[168:07.41]I don't know.
[168:16.02]Talk to me, goddammit!
[168:18.28]Why am I just silent?
[168:19.30]Why wouldn't we want to work together?
[168:30.90]Oh no, one minute!
[168:32.66]Whatever will we do?
[168:34.38]Can we fight through the door?
[168:40.16]I can't hit him through the door.
[168:45.28]Where's the other guy?
[168:46.04]Oh, he's waiting.
[168:52.49]I'm fucking right next to you, dude!
[169:01.71]Open the door!
[169:02.35]Okay, I'm gonna be ready right when the door opens.
[169:26.56]Is the timer up?
[169:31.66]Oh, it is now.
[169:41.07]I hit him right in the groin.
[169:53.24]Okay, don't fuck around.
[170:01.80]Dude, why is he taking a full step forward with his swing?
[170:04.18]You see what I'm doing?
[170:05.06]I'm hitting A. Jesus Christ.
[170:10.49]I'm gonna hit him.
[170:15.25]I'm... Okay.
[170:17.09]A. He does like this full step forward.
[170:19.67]I'm not having him do that.
[170:20.81]Okay, unlock the furnace room.
[170:25.63]Wait, don't fucking go fast.
[170:34.44]See, right here, this is what happened last time.
[170:37.92]I went to open this.
[170:39.98]See?
[170:41.46]It's like, hey, you can touch this.
[170:43.60]That's what happened.
[170:44.72]See what I'm talking about here?
[170:46.67]Look at that bullshit.
[170:47.37]You guys all thought I was fucking mad.
[170:51.37]Okay, I'm back to normal.
[171:00.05]Now I gotta open the furnace door with the mannequin arm.
[171:04.69]Turn this door.
[171:05.61]Whoa, wait.
[171:06.27]Check, check, check, check.
[171:07.49]Always check, check, check, check, check, check, check.

[172:16.00]This is... Why would you put that in this game?
[172:18.64]What's the point of that?
[172:20.18]It's just there to be like a joke.
[172:25.49]Same one.
[172:26.93]I know.
[172:27.51]You don't think I know this?
[172:29.79]What, you think I'm not paying attention to what's happening?
[172:33.25]I know.
[172:33.61]I get it.
[172:34.85]I know.
[172:35.43]I'm trying to make this not a reality.
[172:38.81]I just... Where did he go?
[172:46.79]I don't have much time left.
[172:47.97]I'm going to kill them.

[173:36.01]Okay, come on.
[173:57.40]Is this, like, for pity?
[173:58.60]To make it so you don't get overwhelmed?

[175:49.28]No, you're dead, man.
[175:49.94]You're dead.
[175:51.10]He's dead.

[179:59.88]No!
[180:03.36]How is that not right?
[180:15.76]control back.
[180:21.63]Then... Stop talking.
[180:33.34]Oh!
[180:33.44]Got it.
[180:35.14]Wait, what?
[180:35.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[180:36.68]What am I doing?
[180:40.82]I win.
[180:48.10]I thought it was just been nothing.
[180:53.50]Christ, get away from me, Tad!
[180:56.02]You self-righteous son of a bitch!
[180:57.72]Easy, Jennings.
[180:58.66]You're just reacting to the shock.
[181:00.62]Just calm down.
[181:02.21]You fuck!
[181:03.75]You fucker!
[181:05.37]You're the reason he picked me!
[181:07.61]You!
[181:08.27]Me?
[181:09.46]You killed a man.
[181:10.76]You're a murderer.
[181:12.10]He was homeless.
[181:13.58]He didn't have a family.
[181:14.78]He meant nothing to anyone.
[181:16.42]What about the innocent man you put in prison?
[181:19.24]What about his family?
[181:20.04]Wait, what did you do?
[181:20.90]But he didn't have to come to that.
[181:22.42]Put an innocent man in prison?
[181:23.54]I told you just walk away.
[181:24.68]But no, I had to get your arrest.
[181:28.24]You, you put me in a corner tab.
[181:31.65]I just did what I had to do.
[181:33.05]What you had to do?
[181:35.03]Destroy two people to protect your way of life?
[181:38.28]At least I have something to protect.
[181:41.52]You know what, Tap?
[181:42.84]We're all here because of you.
[181:45.54]So save me the preaching, alright?
[181:48.00]I'm not dying so you can catch the boogeyman.
[181:51.86]You deserve each other.
[181:59.15]Don't even warn him about the steam.
[182:00.55]He'll figure it out.
[182:09.48]I need some, uh, I need some health.
[182:12.12]Yeah, I gotta get this camera out of here.
[182:16.14]The camera's the worst item in the whole game.
[182:17.46]Alright, here we go.
[182:22.90]More bombs!
[182:23.36]Before you are two doors.
[182:26.09]Each will test your faith.
[182:28.37]Will you continue blindly or will you face a greater challenge?
[182:32.61]With your sight intact, make your choice quickly.
[182:36.89]When the timer reaches zero, the bombs located all around you will detonate.
[182:42.16]Wait, what do you mean?
[182:44.40]Here's a path.
[182:52.20]Hey, this one.
[182:55.22]Caution, detective.
[182:56.80]These barrels aren't for show and will explode.
[183:01.40]Okay, so what?
[183:10.95]Am I supposed to not touch them?
[183:29.13]Did I just walk in a circle?
[183:40.60]Why?
[183:41.08]How are they going to explode?
[183:42.14]Where am I?
[183:49.48]Did I go upstairs?
[183:57.22]Wait.
[183:57.66]Oh, wait.
[183:58.00]What the fuck is going on?
[183:59.88]That's right, right?
[184:05.57]I did it.
[184:05.85]1 minute 38 seconds left.
[184:07.75]On the clock.
[184:13.91]There it is.
[184:15.11]Door sealed.
[184:19.65]Wait.
[184:20.07]This is the beginning.
[184:47.01]How did I pick this one?
[184:50.82]Fucking hurry.
[184:52.22]What do you mean hurry?
[184:53.74]This is the most disorienting thing ever.
[185:01.58]Where is... Oh, I have a map.
[185:07.18]Who cares?
[185:07.72]Just use the map.
[185:18.84]No, no, you're not supposed to look at your map.
[185:31.53]Can I just have my head explode and just peek out the door?
[185:39.54]This sucks.
[185:49.64]I'm like stuck in a wall somewhere.
[186:00.74]Give me the other door.
[186:01.42]Fuck this door.
[186:01.92]Give me the other one.
[186:09.40]Do you think when those explosions go off, Saw's upstairs in a chair and he like rocks?
[186:14.08]He's like, whoa.
[186:19.75]Where is he you would feel that everywhere in the whole fucking building?
[186:24.53]All right, I want to let's go make your choice.
[186:26.25]Yeah.
[186:26.57]Yeah.
[186:26.81]Yeah.
[186:27.07]Yeah, don't do one with the blind one or do it.
[186:29.38]No Yes
[186:42.80]Make your choice quickly.
[186:44.42]Hopefully it's like four enemies because that's not a challenge.
[186:47.58]The bomb located all around you will detonate.
[186:50.46]Let's go.
[186:52.07]Okay, let's go this way.
[186:53.39]What's the greater challenge?
[186:57.27]Nothing can be a greater challenge than that.
[186:59.39]Oh no.
[187:06.13]I know how much you suck at this.
[187:12.10]BALANCE OVER ABOARD!
[187:13.24]Oh no, I'm gonna get squashed.
[187:23.05]It got me.
[187:48.11]It's alright.
[187:48.41]That's way better.
[187:49.24]I don't care.
[187:49.88]It's fine.
[187:50.22]It's way better than the other one.
[187:51.66]The other one's so bad.
[187:52.48]I wish I could skip this dialogue.
[187:56.16]This one.
[188:10.59]When the timer reaches zero, the bombs located all around you will detonate.
[188:16.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[188:18.19]It's scary.
[188:18.89]Okay, go.
[188:19.35]Time is of the essence, Detective.
[188:33.49]Okay, good.
[188:36.55]Alright.

[219:16.67]I'm ready.
[219:19.22]People always think their actions affect the one else.
[219:23.29]Who holds a gun like this, by the way?
[219:26.18]This is the way you hold a gun if you're afraid of what it's going to do.
[219:31.24]I gotta get a brace to shit.
[219:33.48]What are you doing?
[219:34.68]Alright, hold on.
[219:35.48]Somebody's coming.
[220:00.27]I'm ready.
[220:00.85]I'm gonna shoot somebody in the head.

[222:30.01]I just want to punch.
[222:33.25]How do I drop?
[222:34.31]I can't drop the gun.
[222:36.93]There's no drop gun.
[222:42.09]Heavy attack?
[222:42.81]No, I just tried to pick up... Oh, well.
[222:47.41]Left bumper?

[223:52.82]This way.
[224:00.68]This glass is just, like, fine.
[224:02.96]Do I have no heals?
[224:06.85]I don't have a heal.
[224:09.39]How the fuck is that possible?
[224:16.18]I used them all.

[225:23.25]Oh, I have to trigger the event.
[225:25.55]Okay, who cares?
[225:39.32]Yeah, that guy kills people.

[226:49.06]Probably chicken related though.
[226:52.70]This is a tough one.

[240:50.54]Stupid, what's this here for?
[240:58.78]Why is this here?
[240:59.38]Not gonna happen.
[241:04.83]Oh, that's not one.
[241:06.03]Yeah, I thought that was one.
[241:06.89]This area contains violent patients.
[241:27.10]Find shelter from the bombs.
[241:31.38]Oh, there's a bomb in here.
[241:41.19]Wait, there's a guy in there.
[241:42.21]There's a Minecraft guy in there.
[241:50.06]What did that do?
[241:51.38]I just powered something.
[242:01.13]What the fuck?
[242:04.95]The sanctuary.
[242:12.36]Did I miss something in there?
[242:16.70]I tried pressing this button.
[242:18.38]Oh, I had to be in the exact perfect location.
[242:20.23]Okay, here we go.
[242:23.81]Holy fuck, he just...
[242:25.69]Alright, watch it.
[242:26.23]Watch it.
[242:26.48]Watch it.
[242:26.74]Watch it.
[242:26.98]Watch it.
[242:27.24]Watch it.
[242:27.42]Here we go.
[242:30.42]I just... What the fuck am I doing?
[242:33.54]I just threw a bottle.
[242:35.78]That wasn't a Molotov cocktail.
[242:37.80]It was just a glass bottle.
[242:39.79]And I only had one.
[242:48.39]Okay.
[242:49.97]That was dumb.
[242:54.34]838.
[242:54.36]You just threw a piss bottle at him.
[243:04.65]Oh, I don't have a weapon.
[243:11.89]More?
[243:12.91]Patience.
[243:13.33]Do I have to wait for 40 seconds?
[243:35.05]Close the door.
[243:36.95]Now have patience.
[243:53.82]Holy shit.
[243:54.52]I did it.
[243:59.32]Where's my key?
[244:14.51]Ooh.
[244:17.15]A secret way to go.
[244:18.19]Okay.
[244:25.64]It's gonna be in the toilet, right?
[244:33.94]There it is.
[244:38.18]It's really, really hard to not get done instantly.
[244:46.35]Storage key.
[244:53.91]Unlock the storage door.
[244:55.11]Okay.
[245:00.78]Moving on.
[245:05.28]I do have to say I'm getting sick and tired of... Disarm the room full of cartoon dynamite.
[245:14.13]You have no other tricks up your sleeve.
[245:17.17]You ended his life.
[245:18.15]Who saved yours?
[245:19.27]9-1-1, what is your emergency?
[245:25.35]Two officers are down at 213 Stygian Street.
[245:28.61]You must hurry.
[245:29.65]Help has been dispatched.
[245:30.91]Sir, are you with the officers right now?
[245:32.79]Detective Singh has been shot.
[245:34.93]I don't think he's going to make it.
[245:36.87]The other has an injury, but he'll live.
[245:39.11]What kind of injury, sir?
[245:40.55]Nothing he can't handle.
[245:42.40]He shouldn't go.
[245:45.06]How does Jigsaw call 911?
[245:46.04]Does it just give two scenarios to the dispatch?
[245:55.05]Also, a bus full of senior citizens is about to fall off a cliff down on Fourth Street.
[246:02.12]Who will you save?
[246:03.86]Make your choice.
[246:12.33]All right, well, get me out of here.
[246:14.47]First, you took his father.
[246:15.41]Will you take his mother next?
[246:20.86]The brain.
[246:23.90]Explosion rocks downtown.
[246:25.36]Okay.
[246:31.71]I could read this.
[246:33.37]Wait, this is about us.
[246:35.39]Lead officer in the Jigsaw Killer case resigned yesterday due to unknown circumstances.
[246:39.90]Shooting death earlier this week of his partner, Detective Stephen Singh, is suspected to be a factor in the resignation.
[246:45.56]Papp could not be reached for comment.
[246:47.76]Papp was a fine officer and a defender of the law.
[246:50.18]We will miss him.
[246:52.54]Detective Mark Hoffman, a similarly decorated officer, will be taking over the lead position.
[246:57.51]Okay.
[247:00.15]Okay.
[247:01.47]Explosion, tape, whatever it's called.
[247:31.79]Dear Mrs. Singh, we have received notice from Stanworth Elementary that you have not responded to concerns raised by your son Franklin's school counselor.
[247:39.44]Okay, please respond within 10 days.
[247:49.15]Uh, time to... This apartment has something going on.
[247:54.01]Fire Detective David Tapp has antics got his partner Steven Singh killed, which in my book makes him too dangerous to carry a gun.
[247:59.72]Who knows when he plans to go rogue.
[248:04.74]What criminal charges against TAP?
[248:07.61]Got my husband killed.
[248:08.99]He's no better than Jigsaw.
[248:11.43]Right, stick it to him.
[248:16.40]Got some lore there.
[248:25.89]You... Hm!
[248:27.73]Somebody there?
[248:35.55]I guess not.
[248:40.55]What tapes?
[248:41.21]You think of my subjects as victims, but what about those who suffer at the hands of your choices?
[248:50.90]Look at what you did in here!
[248:52.88]The life of your partner, his wife, a child.
[248:59.18]How many more before them have paid the price of your selfish
[249:13.10]Look at the true destroyer of lives It's me Okay, let's get the key
[249:34.24]You destroyed their lives.
[249:35.64]I just tortured them to death and killed them.
[249:38.91]Here we go.
[249:39.53]Who said that?
[249:40.01]Here we go.
[250:11.05]Portrait of death and killed?
[250:13.53]Say it ain't so.
[250:14.53]Yeah.
[250:24.10]He's leaving me notes on how to make stuff.
[250:29.84]Jigsaw, you know, you could just be a DM.
[250:37.08]I feel like that's a good avenue for you.
[250:38.64]You don't have to do all this fucking weird shit.
[250:45.32]Wingless angels must fall.
[250:48.80]Wingless angels must fall.
[250:50.42]Sure.
[250:53.26]Okay.
[250:59.59]What does that mean?
[251:07.37]There's somebody here.
[251:08.59]I need a weapon.
[251:11.89]Oh, there's a weapon.
[251:13.30]Am I safe?
[251:15.70]Doing LSD fucking messes you up.
[251:21.80]Where is this person?
[251:22.56]Alright, I'm getting the bat.
[251:28.12]He's not going to be there.
[251:28.98]I'm getting the bat.
[251:52.09]Fuck.
[251:52.19]I'm trying to skip steps.
[251:55.08]Oh, you idiot.
[252:05.45]Oh.
[252:06.25]Alright, I got a... Now I got a bat.
[252:08.81]Nothing scares me now.
[252:09.81]Let me try DMT.
[252:14.94]No.
[252:22.48]Alright, I'm ready.
[252:23.70]Bring it on.
[252:28.00]Get another gear.
[252:34.90]Oh, it's the TVs doing this shit.
[252:38.26]Fallen.
[252:38.90]Fallen.
[252:39.58]Fallen.
[252:40.52]Angel.
[252:41.38]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[252:42.94]Come on, come on.
[252:43.46]Big money, big money, big money.
[252:44.43]Come on, no whammies.
[252:45.11]No whammies.
[252:45.87]No whammies.
[252:46.55]No, come on.
[252:46.93]Big money.
[252:47.39]Stop.
[252:48.55]Ugh.
[252:55.88]Oh, you were here.
[252:56.58]Hey.
[252:56.80]Can you open the door?
[252:59.69]I'm being such a fucking weirdo.
[253:02.05]It's a letter.
[253:21.14]There's a flashlight.
[253:21.84]There's a lighter.
[253:22.48]No, it's a lighter.
[253:23.36]I don't want a lighter.
[253:24.16]Why would I want a lighter right now?
[253:26.34]It's so much worse.
[253:27.06]Alright, open these doors.
[253:36.32]Power this thing.
[253:39.77]Alright, well... How many times up?
[253:49.92]That guy's not scary.
[253:51.92]I hate one of those stupid things.
[253:55.61]Can't go in here.
[254:04.17]It's just sitting in one of these dumb drawers that I didn't look in.
[254:08.41]Is it in a drawer or something?
[254:09.41]Where the hell is this?
[254:14.78]Of course, right there.
[254:18.22]Give me a break.
[254:22.43]Okay.
[254:23.89]Let's do the same puzzle that we've done already a thousand times, except it's way bigger now.
[254:28.47]I don't even... What the fuck am I supposed to do about this shit?
[254:42.56]I...
[255:04.55]I hate this.
[255:05.05]I don't want to do this.
[255:21.65]I'm done.
[255:21.93]No, I'm not done.
[255:23.07]I'm fine.
[255:23.83]I don't want to do it.
[255:25.84]I'm done.
[255:26.28]I don't want to do this.
[255:30.85]I'm done.
[255:32.21]I don't want to do it anymore.
[255:36.23]I'm done.
[255:36.86]Okay, I finished it.
[255:43.78]Open this door.
[255:47.18]Alright, now you can close your mouth.
[255:49.76]Because you're irritating.
[255:51.40]And I will take an upgraded bat, too.
[255:59.43]Thank you.
[256:05.18]That's funny.
[256:09.88]Do I have to destroy the angels?
[256:12.83]Wait, this is not an angel.
[256:14.53]Oh, I do.
[256:15.99]Okay, that was easy.
[256:17.53]No, I would never.
[256:22.85]But you did.
[256:23.45]You tossed him away.
[256:34.89]Oh my god, a ton of money came in and I didn't even look.
[256:39.41]Nishanji gave $70.
[256:40.37]7,000 bits.
[256:40.91]And this is, I believe, like an hour ago.
[257:03.51]Enable face cam.
[257:04.39]Slash enable face cam.
[257:05.65]Slash disable flaccid lock.
[257:08.77]Slash hug germa.
[257:11.83]I don't know any of that.
[257:13.15]I don't understand that line of Java that you just put in.
[257:17.84]Okay.
[257:22.44]Thanks for the 7,000 bits.
[257:24.74]Thanks for the $70.
[257:26.72]Is that what you guys are saying?
[257:27.58]Hack?
[257:29.70]That's 70 fucking bucks.
[257:31.06]Thank you.
[257:33.60]And then nondescript civilian gave 10 community subs.
[257:37.26]Thanks for the huge amount of money, guys.
[257:39.54]Thanks for the gigantic pile of money that you just dumped right onto my lap.
[257:43.54]I'm just like scooping it up as we talk.
[257:47.56]Ah, thanks.
[257:47.94]What was that?
[257:50.82]This guy's got a cube.
[257:53.84]Alright, if you're gonna explode, then just don't come over here.
[258:05.78]You're the reason I'm here.
[258:07.22]You won't stop me.
[258:08.34]Wait, if he punches me, is it going to blow up in my head?
[258:14.36]I dropped the switch and boom.
[258:19.88]I'm wired to blow.
[258:20.97]He did this.
[258:24.83]If I die, we both die.
[258:26.23]Stand on my way or this thing will explode.
[258:29.23]Nice try.
[258:33.09]Nice try.
[258:37.79]well don't let it go
[259:12.31]Careful of that guy.
[259:13.05]If he lets go of that thing, we're all gonna blow.
[259:39.00]Is this in here?
[259:40.90]Ooh!
[259:43.31]All right.
[259:44.67]Wait!
[259:45.63]Come over here.
[259:55.47]Follow me.
[259:59.32]Where is it?
[259:59.96]Oh, he's right there?
[260:01.66]Okay, now I gotta open this door.
[260:04.24]Here we go.
[260:05.20]Ready?
[260:26.82]Oh, he had a coupler.
[260:33.14]We're gonna get down there.
[260:39.91]How do I get down there?
[260:42.61]From here.
[260:52.20]This is crap.
[260:55.42]Whatever, I just need to do one.
[260:56.92]Alright, well that was easy.
[260:58.68]Anything else?
[261:00.32]I need health.
[261:05.97]Why did I do that?
[261:06.81]Alright, turn it off.
[261:09.17]Turn the fucking thing off, man.
[261:12.79]Turn it off.
[261:13.17]It's off, right?
[261:13.73]Whoa.
[261:20.00]That could be me.
[261:23.31]All right.
[261:24.27]I wonder how far into the game is over.
[261:26.91]Anybody have any idea?
[261:27.75]How close am I to the end of the game?
[261:30.42]I feel like I'm getting close.
[261:48.70]He's the one.
[261:49.84]It's his fault all of this happened.
[261:51.98]I hate him even more.
[261:53.54]The only way to move forward is to forgive.
[261:57.54]To shed your rage and accept your suffering.
[262:00.74]I want to see him suffer.
[262:02.68]I want him to know what it's like.
[262:04.54]There will be suffering, oh yes.
[262:07.76]But suffering is just a beginning.
[262:10.55]He has everything he needs to free you.
[262:14.61]I hope you have faith that he reaches you.
[262:19.91]Tap.
[262:21.33]Tap in.
[262:22.23]Tap in.
[262:23.19]Tap.
[262:23.81]Tap time in.
[262:24.95]Time.
[262:25.53]Tap in.
[262:25.99]Alright, I'm tapping in.
[262:30.11]Rescue Melissa Singh.
[262:35.51]Don't move.
[262:38.19]Don't move.
[262:39.47]I'm coming up there and I'm gonna cut the blue wire or whatever I need to do.
[262:44.34]I'm coming.
[262:59.11]I've gotta do this elaborate fucking puzzle.
[263:01.19]She's dead.
[263:02.67]You understood the risks of marrying an officer of the law.
[263:06.57]When he was killed, you let your vengeance with Detective Tapp consume you.
[263:11.41]Your life crumbled and you neglected your son.
[263:15.11]I now offer you a gift, a chance to break through the numbness and taste the life you buried with your husband.
[263:22.41]Will you forgive Detective Tapp or is your hatred too great to be satiated?
[263:28.71]I'm an iron maiden.
[263:29.81]Time for a lawsuit.
[263:31.43]Okay, magnetic puzzle.
[263:33.69]Move.
[263:34.25]What am I moving?
[263:35.66]Okay, we're moving down.
[263:37.62]And we're moving...
[263:59.67]down oh okay whatever I skipped it he'll be fine and then we got to go over then we got to go up left down and then right and then down and then she's gonna get killed I think okay I did it the game doesn't even care I win
[264:27.02]Hey, don't worry.
[264:27.66]He fucked up the programming on this thing.
[264:29.62]I'm gonna get you out of here.
[264:40.27]Oh, that one worked.
[264:52.95]Only one more.
[264:56.86]Oh, um, this is the fastest probably anyone's ever done this in the game.
[264:59.82]Okay.
[265:02.53]Uh, this one, I don't know.
[265:03.63]Whatever, we're going this way.
[265:15.04]Alright, cool.
[265:20.20]Wait, that one worked.
[265:21.80]That was six, right?
[265:25.62]How do I salvage this?
[265:44.97]Melissa, I... Don't you touch me.
[265:48.13]Get away.
[265:48.77]This is all your fault.
[265:49.95]All because of you.
[265:51.09]Why won't you just leave me alone?
[265:52.50]Just take it easy, okay?
[265:54.34]I wish you were.
[265:55.62]I wish... I wish you hadn't saved me from that thing.
[265:59.04]I wish I were dead, too.
[266:02.16]Anything would be better than this.
[266:04.71]I can't feel anything anymore.
[266:05.85]You think I didn't try?
[266:07.05]You think it doesn't eat at me every day?
[266:10.41]I can't change what happened.
[266:12.93]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[266:13.43]Hurry, hurry, I'm only 400 pounds, feed me more.
[266:16.93]I'm up to 500 pounds, that's not enough.
[266:19.73]Yeah, is the game over?
[266:39.21]Does this game suck?
[266:40.19]Anybody aware of that yet?
[266:42.70]Oops, sorry.
[266:43.32]Oh.
[266:45.76]Oh, okay.
[266:47.52]You mean, like, storyline-wise.
[266:49.76]Okay, let's go.
[266:52.00]Escape with Melissa.
[266:53.00]Find the clue.
[266:53.79]Alright, Melissa.
[266:59.35]Follow me.
[267:00.91]Hey.
[267:01.75]You good with the gun?
[267:04.89]I know a thing or two.
[267:06.33]Oh, awesome.
[267:07.01]The best line that you could just say.
[267:08.63]Literally everyone, every fucking person says that in every movie, every TV show, doesn't matter.
[267:13.25]Every single one.
[267:15.14]Nice.
[267:18.00]And then they spin, flip, flip, click, load, snap, snap, zip, flip.
[267:22.90]Ooh, you know, you might, you've used a gun I think before.
[267:25.40]Yeah, I have.
[267:26.44]Whoa.
[267:28.04]Nice.
[267:30.90]That's surprising to me.
[267:31.76]Your character does not seem to be someone that would use a gun like that well.
[267:35.70]You've surprised me.
[267:36.48]Thank you, Everymovie.
[267:44.59]I'm sorry, David.
[267:45.83]You deserve this.
[267:47.23]He said if I made it this far, I could choose to leave.
[267:50.27]I'm leaving.
[267:51.35]And I am.
[267:52.11]No, no, you're taking the headphones.
[267:53.47]I'm not.
[267:54.17]Sorry.
[267:55.03]Oh, please.
[267:56.53]There's a trip to Hawaii at the end of this.
[267:58.05]You fucking idiot.
[267:58.91]Nice.
[267:59.17]Thanks.
[267:59.39]I'm gonna get the trip to Hawaii.
[268:00.35]You can go fuck off.
[268:01.57]Yeah, take your, like, $72 headphones.
[268:04.35]I'm getting a $7,000 trip to fucking Hawaii.
[268:06.54]What an idiot.
[268:07.74]We're so close to the end, too.
[268:09.06]You're gonna take the fucking... Unbelievable.
[268:10.76]What a moron.
[268:12.76]You seem to lose, man.
[268:22.08]You paint these?
[268:31.02]Right now Jigsaw is sitting there really getting a little nervous.
[268:35.14]Oh, everybody takes the fucking headphones.
[268:38.50]That's getting close.
[268:43.28]Am I really gonna have to pony up, like, seven grand?
[268:47.18]Ugh.
[268:48.10]Usually they're dead two hours ago.
[268:50.58]Uh, I have a spiked bat.
[269:05.59]Oh, more TVs.
[269:07.29]Okay.
[269:07.61]You are a broken man, detective.
[269:10.20]Scavenged into pieces.
[269:12.84]So is the man trapped at the end of this war, a man who destroyed your reputation piece by piece.
[269:20.38]Will you help him?
[269:21.82]To do so, there are pieces to a puzzle that you must find.
[269:26.33]Assembling these pieces will bring you one step closer to solving the puzzle of catching me.
[269:32.61]It is a dangerous game, detectives.
[269:37.02]Oh, you know, I'll take the headphones.
[269:39.18]Never mind.
[269:39.98]I'll take the headphones.
[269:41.68]This is... Ah, I don't care.
[269:44.10]Locate the puzzle pieces in Pine Ward.
[269:46.01]Find... Whatever.
[269:47.13]Let me guess.
[269:57.28]Key in the toilet.
[269:59.56]Oh, I wonder.
[270:00.32]Hmm.
[270:02.26]Oh, there's something different.
[270:03.42]There's a gear in the toilet.
[270:08.14]So many little treasures inside of the syringed toilets.
[270:19.49]Alright, there's somebody in here that I gotta save or find or... Don't ask me where.
[270:25.87]I still have this thing on my head.
[270:36.29]Same shit every time.
[270:39.19]I'll be honest.
[270:41.19]Just let it be open.
[270:42.13]Just open it.
[270:42.67]That puzzle, it doesn't... It's not even there for any reason.
[270:47.89]Why is it there?
[270:49.95]Just let me open the cabinet at some point, right?
[270:52.49]Like, it doesn't do anything.
[271:09.63]Okay, if it were me, I could just leave without a problem.
[271:24.62]Somebody's here.
[271:25.10]Okay, are we ever gonna find out who's the person that's upstairs making all that noise?
[271:35.91]Hold it from the other side.
[271:39.52]Hold it from the other side.
[271:42.76]And... Look at this.
[271:47.06]I'm here.
[271:49.18]I'm coming.
[271:56.42]Am I the... I'm scary.
[272:00.28]I'm the scary guy.
[272:06.32]Where are you?
[272:08.60]Oh, what happened?
[272:17.19]Did I?
[272:17.89]Why do I feel like I did that?
[272:20.85]Hey!
[272:21.15]Hey!
[272:22.19]Get away!
[272:25.57]Get away!
[272:25.83]Get away!
[272:26.07]Get away from me!
[272:26.45]Get away from me!
[272:26.81]Get away from me!
[272:27.19]I'm sneaking through!
[272:31.45]Get away from me, please!
[272:34.21]What?! !
[272:36.89]This is still blinking!
[272:38.03]This is still blinking!
[272:41.63]Why did mine blink?
[272:42.63]Did I get- Wait!
[272:44.09]Was that a shotgun thing?
[272:45.25]Was that a tripwire?
[272:50.04]No, it wasn't.
[272:51.46]Was it?
[272:53.70]Oh, come on.
[272:54.98]It was?
[272:57.93]No shit.
[272:58.99]Are you kidding me?
[273:01.53]That's so stupid.
[273:06.86]Oh my god.
[273:08.02]No, don't get- I don't want the lamp.
[273:14.38]Use the paint thinner bomb?
[273:17.56]I don't even know how to use this.
[273:19.71]RB.
[273:19.89]How do I use it though?
[273:37.32]RB.
[273:42.55]Do I just throw, like, RB through the X or something?
[273:46.51]There's a juke classic?
[273:47.87]Sick.
[273:55.01]There are four traps in the entire game.
[273:59.79]Use RB.
[274:00.47]I mean, I'm doing it right now.
[274:10.30]What's the jigsaw screen here?
[274:11.52]Kill a hundred people just to convince someone that they're not, that they're kind of a dick?
[274:15.84]Yeah, I mean, it's kind of every one of these movies.
[274:28.83]It kind of stems from... You are a... Alright, throw this at him.
[274:33.35]Throw it!
[274:54.79]I got you.
[274:56.51]You piece of shit.
[274:59.93]You couldn't squeeze through the wall.
[275:02.53]I could.
[275:04.27]Wait, did he squeeze through the wall?
[275:10.19]I don't know.
[275:11.83]He's gone now.
[275:12.71]Not my problem.
[275:19.90]God.
[275:21.32]If I didn't stop... If I didn't stop, it would have happened again.
[275:28.14]I hate that.
[275:31.06]What a dumb thing to have in this game.
[275:33.78]It's just sometimes you're just gonna get your head exploded.
[275:36.32]There's no... What's the goal here?
[275:49.22]I don't know.
[275:49.56]Locate the puzzle pieces in Pine Ward.
[275:55.64]I'm about to take the headphones.
[275:58.21]So, God, I'm sorry.
[275:59.33]What have I done?
[276:00.13]What did you do?
[276:00.53]What's a heal?
[276:08.10]This is like I'm kind of just pissing into the wall here.
[276:23.13]Alright, I'm ready.
[276:26.41]What was that?
[276:27.75]Oh god, I'm sorry.
[276:29.33]You don't have anything else!
[276:31.37]Turn on the lights.
[276:32.65]Okay, one.
[276:33.13]The same shit again!
[276:52.23]I just paint numbers on walls in a 207.
[276:55.57]Oh, look out, I painted a number on a wall.
[277:02.70]You'll never find out what the solution is. 207.
[277:18.36]Which one is this?
[277:19.02]209.
[277:19.42]It's 208.
[277:20.66]There's going to be something here.
[277:23.82]It's shooting the head.
[277:30.31]What is his name?
[277:30.95]Remember his name?
[277:31.63]You couldn't protect anyone.
[277:32.71]Okay, let's go.
[277:38.04]Oh, come on.
[277:39.10]Ishii, come on.
[277:50.01]Bag of puzzle pieces.
[277:51.06]One I thought that said 12.
[277:51.92]This is going to be an unpopular opinion and I cringe at the amount of letters this paper will receive.
[277:59.56]I think this is a Reddit post.
[278:01.22]I'm going to propose the following.
[278:02.40]What if the jigsaw killer is good for our moral fabric?
[278:05.67]If you follow the methods of the Jigsaw Killer closely, you might see what he's trying to do.
[278:10.14]Make people better themselves.
[278:11.10]This is one of those comments that you have to go all the way down.
[278:12.88]And you have to click the show deleted comment.
[278:15.62]Because it's got minus 500 clicks on it.
[278:19.54]It's been negatively downvoted so many times.
[278:21.82]This person is fucking nuts.
[278:25.96]I got one of two puzzle pieces.
[278:31.06]Wait, another one of these unpopular opinion pieces?
[278:33.50]Lies.
[278:33.92]Corrupt.
[278:34.64]Remember being slandered.
[278:36.14]How does it feel?
[278:36.74]How does it feel?
[278:38.04]I don't know.
[278:39.96]How does... Okay.
[278:43.03]The timer stopped?
[278:46.39]Oh, the timer stopped.
[278:47.85]Nice.
[278:54.39]Why'd the timer stop?
[279:29.82]That was a lockpick to get a lockpick.
[279:33.78]Give me a fucking break.
[279:35.00]Wait, someone's talking.
[279:37.68]I heard somebody.
[279:40.21]Turn on the lights.
[279:40.79]Find the room before the boom.
[279:43.57]Okay.
[279:46.17]Let's keep going.
[279:51.57]Didn't go in 206.
[279:59.67]Just nails.
[280:00.85]Cool.
[280:02.85]Wow.
[280:03.09]Should I even open... I don't... There could be a thousand dollars in those and I don't even care.
[280:07.65]Good.
[280:08.59]You found the pine ward piece.
[280:11.21]Find the other pieces in the oak ward to save life.
[280:14.94]This is just the beginning.
[280:17.14]This is just the beginning?
[280:18.06]How does it feel to be judged?
[280:19.26]How does it feel to make it through the tutorial?
[280:25.62]You've got at least six to twelve more hours to skip.
[280:38.83]Alright, what's the time to beat on this?
[280:40.36]Somebody look it up for me real quick.
[280:46.12]I bet there's a saw for the Xbox 360.
[280:47.56]This... This is five hours?
[280:53.69]Six, five, six hours.
[280:55.85]Oh, shit.
[280:56.43]Alright, I'm getting... Can I fall on this?
[281:05.90]No, that...
[281:07.81]I didn't even do that.
[281:09.39]Okay, whatever.
[281:10.57]That's so dumb.
[281:12.01]What is this shit?
[281:12.73]Let me out of here!
[281:14.09]When I get out of this thing, I'll... You what?
[281:18.19]Write a story about me?
[281:20.93]You've already done so much, Oswald.
[281:24.07]Oh.
[281:25.69]Oh, shit!
[281:26.60]Literally one person said five.
[281:28.66]You're the jigsaw killer!
[281:30.42]That is the name you have given me.
[281:33.08]Your words have changed how people perceive me.
[281:36.60]Regardless of the truth, now that your words are useless, what is left?
[281:45.70]I'll see if I can come get you.
[281:49.17]Six to seven hour game.
[281:53.41]Well, that's to get the vacation.
[281:56.91]You know, I still have an opportunity to get the headphones.
[282:00.83]You know what I'm saying?
[282:13.21]That's the same joke.
[282:14.29]Well, it's relevant to how much longer I want to stream this game for.
[282:25.80]I wish I had the gun right now.
[282:27.12]Why can't I not have the gun?
[282:28.76]Wait, it's gun trapped.
[282:56.13]Nice.
[282:58.93]You're the reason I'm here.
[282:59.97]You did this.
[283:00.98]You're the reason.
[283:03.04]You're the reason this is all happening.
[283:04.74]I want that key.
[283:06.12]What's wrong with him?
[283:15.06]Why is he losing health?
[283:17.17]Wait, he can come up here?
[283:18.07]This is the game.
[283:23.17]Let's do it.
[283:26.90]This is the game.
[283:28.32]Let's do it.
[283:41.60]That's the game.
[283:43.03]Yeah, it's alright.
[283:44.39]Okay, well now I know what the fuck is going on.
[283:46.49]Stuntrap.
[283:48.31]I got like a thing that said activate the stuntrap.
[283:52.31]How do I do that?
[284:02.46]Alright, where- it said stuntrap.
[284:04.53]I had an opportunity- alright, fuck it.
[284:05.59]I'm just doing this again.
[284:06.67]I'm gonna cheese this again.
[284:14.15]Wait, wait.
[284:14.53]What?
[284:14.89]Why is there a bugleberry?
[284:48.48]This is really important for me to see if I can do this.
[284:58.13]Is that hurting him?
[285:04.83]Damn it, it's not hurting him.
[285:06.17]I wish it was.
[285:08.60]That's a flashlight.
[285:12.48]Fuck, he's kicking my ass.
[285:31.51]Alright, I got the health back.
[285:33.75]Can I get his weapon?
[285:40.45]He was very nonchalant about that whole thing too.
[285:43.92]I'm gonna get that key.
[285:45.62]You're the reason I'm here.
[285:47.50]I'm here because of you.
[285:49.92]You're the reason why I got into this situation in the first place.
[285:52.82]I don't want the camera.
[285:55.32]Fuck the camera.
[285:56.92]Explosive trap schematic.
[286:04.44]in there.
[286:05.62]Done.
[286:27.52]Never that easy, is it?
[286:38.05]How fucking easy is it?
[287:37.61]What the fuck?
[287:38.55]Really?
[287:48.97]What's that cog besides the other cog?
[287:50.39]What are you talking about?
[287:54.07]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[287:58.34]Now I've gotta connect to this.
[288:10.77]Done.
[288:16.15]Why is it so loud?
[288:17.15]Because this game is not good.
[288:19.39]I don't know.
[288:22.61]I think this game expected me to run around all over the place.
[288:25.47]Fight this guy.
[288:34.08]Okay.
[288:36.36]Why do I still want to play this though?
[288:38.51]This is strange.
[288:39.55]I shouldn't want to still do this.
[288:40.97]Turn this shit off.
[288:51.60]Wait, why is this open?
[288:53.24]This was just open.
[288:53.92]This used to be open.
[288:54.50]Why is this not open anymore?
[288:58.16]That was open before.
[288:59.36]Why is it closed?
[289:04.31]I closed it.
[289:04.89]How did I close that?
[289:06.23]What did I do?
[289:13.27]Oh, I pressed this button.
[289:21.35]Alright, tell me the next part.
[289:24.03]How would I?
[289:24.53]No.
[289:24.95]Done.
[289:25.15]Alright, TV.
[289:26.91]Tell me what to do.
[289:28.55]Zero seconds left.
[289:35.90]Hello, TV.
[289:36.62]Tell me what to do.
[289:48.31]Why is the TV not telling me what to do?
[290:06.06]What is this for?
[290:07.70]Turn this on?
[290:08.18]Did I just turn it on?
[290:13.36]What is it?
[290:13.66]I think somebody's out here.
[290:14.32]Did I get him?
[290:26.08]There's somebody like following me around.
[290:28.54]Somewhere.
[290:33.30]Where are they?
[290:41.80]Is this all for the other guy who immersed?
[290:44.52]Oh, shit.
[290:44.86]Yeah, big bits.
[290:45.60]Hold on.
[290:46.48]Big bits.
[290:48.02]I think this is for that other boss.
[290:51.49]That I just was fighting.
[290:56.41]Okay, we had 10,000 bits.
[291:00.47]I fucked it up.
[291:01.03]How did I fuck it up?
[291:02.83]It's 100 more dollars.
[291:03.95]It's fucking insane.
[291:07.93]Thanks for the 100 bucks, Slime4.
[291:12.86]10,000 bits.
[291:15.18]Thanks for giving me and my friends so many laughs over the years.
[291:17.19]I've been watching since early TF Tuber days.
[291:20.33]It's a long time.
[291:21.83]Your content's always been something me and my friends quote all the time.
[291:24.59]I'm fucking quotable.
[291:27.03]I never get to catch the streams, but just wanted to donate and show my love for all the years of laughter.
[291:30.43]Okay, well.
[292:14.32]Run one build in a day.
[292:17.70]Go for it anyway.
[292:19.10]Don't step in that.
[292:30.47]Sick run!
[292:35.67]Alright, it still wants me to fight a boss.
[292:38.51]I've already fought him and I've already killed him.
[292:44.78]I'm about to take the headphones.
[292:45.92]Where are they?
[292:46.54]I'm about to take them.
[292:47.76]I'm gonna take the headphones, I think.
[293:07.23]Where does this want me to go?
[293:08.45]Just straight, then bang a left and go straight?
[293:10.72]I'm just... What's the point of the glass?
[293:14.57]Um, I'm just going up.
[293:20.79]Oh, right.
[293:21.53]Okay.
[293:24.29]Did I just do that?
[293:26.62]Oh, wait.
[293:28.16]Where's this person?
[293:33.10]Why did I shoot him?
[293:33.72]He was going to die anyways by walking in the fire.
[293:41.33]You're gonna spawn camp me?
[293:43.13]You even let me come out of the spawn?
[293:46.51]Where?
[293:46.77]Oh, there he is.
[293:47.37]Okay.
[293:50.33]I have to get the really embarrassing headshot.
[293:54.71]Remember doing this shit to people in Team Fortress?
[293:58.06]And the door would open, close, open, close.
[293:59.62]You'd kill everybody in there, and then there would be a sniper.
[294:02.62]That the door would open, boom!
[294:03.72]You got headshot.
[294:04.38]It was insanely embarrassing because you were spawn camping.
[294:06.30]Dude, this seems so dumb to aim.
[294:17.43]I didn't get him.
[294:18.34]Wait, did he already... Is he still up there?
[294:23.06]I can't see.
[294:23.70]Alright, fire.
[294:28.62]Go away.
[294:29.06]You don't have anything on you.
[294:42.04]I'm about to fucking scream.
[294:45.48]Dude, I'm gonna scream, I think.
[294:59.36]Ooh.
[295:00.69]Explosive trap.
[295:03.07]Make two of them.
[295:08.99]Gas trap.
[295:09.93]Make another one.
[295:11.57]Nice.
[295:11.87]Okay, I've got... How the fuck do I use these things?
[295:14.07]I don't even know how to use them.
[295:25.00]RB?
[295:25.56]Yeah, but... L2 and R2?
[295:31.34]That doesn't do anything.
[295:41.22]Falsely accused.
[295:42.53]Drink.
[295:43.33]Drink the sink.
[295:54.57]What the hell was the point of that?
[296:01.47]Key in the toilet?
[296:06.47]There are no toilets in here.
[296:07.49]Oh, let's go.
[296:18.95]That way.

[297:06.86]$150.
[297:13.48]Just woke up.
[297:14.00]Did you have to restart the game again?
[297:15.90]Yes.
[297:17.36]I think when you were here last... Yeah, I had to restart twice.
[297:19.19]The second time was a trillion times worse than the first.
[297:24.51]Because I was an hour into the gameplay.
[297:28.99]Thanks for the hundred and fifty fucking dollars.
[297:32.29]Thanks for the hundred and fifty bucks.
[297:34.52]Thanks for the insane amount of money.
[297:41.30]I'm gonna nail this guy, okay.
[297:43.72]He keeps wanting to give me the camera.
[297:45.22]I'm gonna take it.
[297:48.06]Don't ask me why I'm doing this, but I'm doing it.
[297:49.57]I'm taking the camera.
[297:53.07]Oh, I have a gun.
[297:56.91]Now, where does it want me to go?
[297:57.99]We'll locate more puzzle pieces in the oak ward.
[298:14.85]Fuck, I missed the shot.
[298:15.67]Do it again.
[298:24.72]How did you get up there?
[298:25.46]Alright, the camera's the stupidest thing.
[298:29.60]I'm putting it back.
[298:30.20]I don't want it.
[298:30.88]It sucks.
[298:32.71]I don't care.
[298:33.13]This thing eats total ass.
[298:38.95]Why would you ever use this?
[298:43.40]It wants me to use it so bad, but no!
[298:47.48]I can't even find the flashlight anymore.
[298:58.75]Is it gone?
[298:59.11]It was back behind that door.
[299:09.35]Oh, what a pain in the ass.
[299:24.68]Oh, it's the worst.
[299:25.80]It's the worst.
[299:26.58]It's the worst.
[299:33.67]Yeah, the cop that couldn't catch you cut him up and killed his partner I
[299:50.25]You insinuated that we were the same person.
[299:53.58]I believe that credit should be given where credit is due.
[299:57.30]You ruined the man's life with your constant insinuations.
[300:02.76]Words are powerful, Oswald, but so are actions.
[300:13.75]Glad I still have this stupid-ass camera.
[300:19.51]This thing's going to get me killed.
[300:21.52]I know it.
[300:21.86]What the hell happened in here?
[300:35.45]This one doesn't look winnable.
[300:37.99]That thing looks like it just kills you.
[300:51.56]closer than we think what if jigsaw is one of the officers that's tasked to catch him say detective tap hmm I think it's me Wow somebody else is the reason not me this time interesting ow what do you say ow for
[301:22.07]Holy shit.

[301:36.38]Uh oh.
[301:46.36]He still thinks he's alive.
[301:57.27]Over here.
[301:58.09]No, don't even use a bullet on him.
[301:59.05]Put the gun down.
[302:01.13]Oh, drop the gun.
[302:01.79]I want to drop the gun.
[302:02.33]Did he drop the gun?
[302:07.04]Okay.
[302:11.12]Yeah, why use a bullet on him?
[302:14.40]It'd be a waste.
[302:14.83]Where's the gun?
[302:18.39]Where's the gun?
[302:35.49]I was gonna say, that's... That'd be really fucking dumb.
[302:41.81]I fucking hate this game.
[302:42.77]Okay.
[303:13.02]Did I get him?
[303:16.86]Got it.
[303:17.46]Alright, done.
[303:21.88]Let's go.
[303:36.71]Don't step on this stupid thing.
[303:38.35]Look, you can't even see this shit.
[303:39.51]Give me the lighter.
[303:41.27]Thank God I can get rid of this stupid thing.
[303:44.57]What the fuck?
[303:50.68]Whatever.
[304:09.56]It's worth doing this every time because you get the health.
[304:13.20]I need it.
[304:13.58]Bad.
[304:17.00]Okay, hi.
[304:17.94]Let's move.
[304:20.06]Now I gotta go... I gotta go to Oak Ward.
[304:23.30]Which... Is it this way or the other way?
[304:26.70]Doesn't look like it's this way.
[304:27.74]This is somebody painted stuff here.
[304:29.10]Down here.
[304:39.06]Why is this game long?
[304:41.56]It's not.
[304:42.82]It's kind of not.
[304:44.48]It's only been five hours.
[304:50.06]I think it just feels that way because the game is not good.
[304:55.16]It's not very good.
[304:56.56]So... But, you know, it's fine.
[305:08.66]Okay, we need the last puzzle piece and then I'm going to assume that this is the climax of the game.
[305:14.66]There you are.
[305:15.12]Are you kidding me?
[305:25.74]Nice try!
[305:29.70]You don't want to kill me?
[305:31.24]You won't stop me!
[305:37.39]What's the password?
[305:38.21]Dude, can you just tell it to me?
[305:42.29]Move them.
[305:43.11]Can I go in here?
[305:45.67]Oh, I can go in here.
[306:04.75]Wait, you got the... What is the password?
[306:07.63]You already have the password.
[306:09.43]What's the password?
[306:12.13]Somebody just have it?
[306:12.68]What is it?
[306:12.94]I don't care I don't care.
[306:14.16]What is it?
[306:14.44]What is it?
[306:14.76]I'm serious.
[306:32.52]Somebody has to have looked it up, right?
[306:34.20]74?
[306:34.22]That's not it.
[306:37.60]467.
[306:40.91]Not it.
[307:07.06]264.
[307:14.21]I don't know what happened eventually.
[307:16.53]457. 556.
[307:34.71]985.
[307:34.73]7... 797.
[307:34.77]7-7... 7-6-5.
[307:34.89]7... 702.
[307:35.03]No, that's... That's...
[308:04.73]Okay, what?
[308:06.25]I'm not trying to be funny.
[308:07.44]I just want you to tell me the answer.
[308:08.66]I'm gonna look it up.
[308:11.10]I don't wanna go get it.
[308:15.14]Seven.
[308:19.45]No, it's gonna take too long.
[308:20.25]Fine.
[308:28.25]Four.
[308:29.33]You keep saying the same one.
[308:30.46]435.
[308:30.48]That's not it.
[308:35.84]It's eight... No, it's not.
[308:38.02]It's in this link.
[308:40.66]I tried to look it up.
[308:41.34]It's not in the guide.
[308:42.38]Yes, it is.Rome wasn't built today, but go for it anyway.
[308:46.16]Don't step in that.
[308:47.16]Jeremy here.
[308:48.28]What?
[308:51.24]I just tried to look it up.
[309:04.19]Shit.
[309:06.61]Birch.
[309:06.83]This fucking almost knocked me over.
[309:07.85]Where is it?
[309:09.33]Where is it?
[309:09.67]Where is it?
[309:10.11]It's going to be just right here.
[309:11.07]Where is it?
[309:11.35]Okay, I don't see it.
[309:12.07]Where is it?
[309:12.41]Where is the number?
[309:15.06]Okay.
[309:15.84]Number, number, number, number, number.
[309:17.22]Where is it?
[309:17.62]I don't see a number.
[309:18.44]No number.
[309:18.84]Why am I locked in here now?
[309:29.79]Cool.
[309:31.23]Okay.
[309:43.99]What the fuck is he supposed to be doing?
[309:52.97]Uh, get the shit out of the way?
[309:59.90]I don't know.
[310:06.88]What is this salt?
[310:11.31]Okay, I can get to the door.
[310:13.49]I win.
[310:16.27]Wait, is it not?
[310:18.05]Was I not supposed to do that?
[310:20.71]Go, go, go, go!
[310:35.61]What happened to the puzzle up there?
[310:43.21]Did I miss it or something?
[310:47.53]Rigid arms contain the code.
[311:05.66]Sucks.
[311:07.28]I don't have my flashlight.
[311:08.82]Can I turn this on?
[311:12.65]Oh.
[311:13.65]Spotlight.
[311:17.99]See, this is what it looks like from my angle.
[311:19.55]This is what it's like to beat the streamer.
[311:23.36]You guys see from over here, and it's like, wow, there he is, like, on stage.
[311:26.42]This is what I see.
[311:29.12]My internet turned off?
[311:31.70]Oh.
[311:32.56]Hold on, let me fix it.
[311:35.61]Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.
[311:37.41]Hold on, let me fix it, hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it.
[311:39.09]Hold on, wait, let me fix it.
[311:39.93]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, let me fix it.
[311:48.32]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[311:52.22]Fiverr, Omega, lol.
[311:55.75]I gotta change my server.
[311:56.79]I'm on... It's all fucked up.
[311:58.95]It's the server.
[312:00.05]Alright, I'm... Hold on.
[312:07.55]I will be back in 10 seconds!
[312:32.39]Hi.
[312:36.17]Hey.
[312:38.99]And we're back.
[312:39.49]What's going on?
[312:45.51]Welcome back to the show.
[312:52.43]We're here?
[312:55.73]I'm here, right?
[312:57.75]Yeah, I'm good.
[313:02.09]We're good.
[313:04.89]Alright, yeah, we're good.
[313:05.95]Sorry about that.
[313:06.65]The VPN I was using, the server I was on, fucking shit the bed.
[313:10.80]Hey, you gotta have that fucking good security, though.
[313:14.00]You know what I'm saying?
[313:14.50]Let's go.
[313:14.84]What was the last thing you heard me say? 206.
[313:31.89]We cast light upon it.
[313:34.05]Secrets of the dark.
[313:37.65]This is a trial of your pain as well as his.
[313:41.43]Slander is not an easy thing to face.
[313:45.33]Okay, goodbye.
[313:48.31]Thanks.
[313:48.49]Can I walk on this?
[313:52.99]What the hell did I end up?
[313:56.23]Can I walk on that?
[313:58.59]I feel like I can't.
[314:07.44]What's the point of that?
[314:09.64]That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.
[314:14.02]God, that was just odd.
[314:16.38]Abnormal.
[314:16.90]Alright, back to that door with the thing on it that I had to 206.
[314:27.95]Now what?
[314:28.94]Is there a timer going off?
[314:33.51]Oh my god.
[314:34.89]You can't be serious.
[314:38.19]You can't be fucking serious.
[314:46.19]God.
[314:47.45]Where's the valve?
[314:49.43]Where's the valve?
[314:53.88]I don't even have any fucking healing.
[315:04.25]I'm about to fucking die!
[315:12.91]Turn it off!
[315:14.73]I can't... I get it?
[315:31.02]Take the headphones.
[315:32.94]They're right there too.
[315:34.00]I could just get them right now.
[315:35.08]I could grab them right now.
[315:41.53]They're right there.
[315:43.81]The headphones are right fucking there.
[315:49.29]I could get the minor prize.
[315:50.45]I could get that fucking prize right now.
[316:04.80]Where did I just end up?
[316:12.94]Where the hell am I going?
[316:16.36]Was I have to go down?
[316:19.42]What a dumb system.
[316:22.18]Fucking puzzles.
[316:25.34]Not even a puzzle.
[316:28.34]It's just anxiety.
[316:29.74]I'm doing it first try.
[316:31.02]Open it.
[316:41.11]No, stop, you oversensitive piece of shit.
[316:44.33]Oh, you're gonna change this from fucking on, you're really fat.
[316:47.17]Where is the right one?
[316:50.94]What the fuck is happening?
[316:53.12]Where is it?
[316:53.66]Okay.
[317:03.11]I got it.
[317:03.53]Fuck off.
[317:04.05]I got it.
[317:05.03]It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,
[317:17.54]Dumbass game.
[317:19.02]This is a three on Rotten Tomatoes?
[317:20.68]Yeah, I mean the movie too.
[317:24.22]Both of them.
[317:29.59]What was the point of this?
[317:30.33]To get another just to get replaced my gun?
[317:37.45]Really?
[317:46.37]That fucking prize is looking kind of good.
[317:49.36]Fuck.
[317:50.02]I can't.
[317:51.05]It can't be much longer.
[317:52.23]It can't be much longer than that.
[318:21.87]There's so much left.
[318:24.81]There can't be.
[318:27.85]When I get out of this, and I get to the... I have to get the second puzzle piece key.
[318:34.33]Then I'll determine if I'm going to take the prize or not.
[318:36.59]And that's on me to decide.
[318:39.45]Where the fuck am I going?
[318:40.27]Use 206 to gain entry into the objective room.
[318:43.09]Right.
[318:43.51]And where is that?
[318:45.39]Like, where are we going here?
[318:46.52]That's death.
[318:46.98]I would have just walked into that and died.
[319:02.01]What is this?
[319:08.93]Why am I laughing at that?
[319:10.78]Alright, it's up the stairs.
[319:12.26]Does anybody have any idea where this is supposed to be?
[319:18.38]I don't remember anything.
[319:22.33]A puzzle.
[319:23.05]Oh, I wonder.
[319:35.56]Wait, I remember this part.
[319:36.66]And then... Wait.
[319:39.46]Isn't it like up here?
[319:42.29]It's up here.
[319:42.67]Okay.
[319:44.11]I... Out here and then this way.
[319:47.97]Then... This way.
[319:51.43]Click on that.
[320:02.96]Alright.
[320:04.72]Ooh.
[320:08.51]Can't make anything.
[320:09.81]Because I can't.
[320:12.13]Can't get out of this.
[320:14.03]Squeeze.
[320:17.08]Still playing this?
[320:20.08]Yeah.
[320:21.82]Alright, go this way.
[320:26.58]Why not have an arrow?
[320:27.95]Why not have an arrow?
[320:28.61]Why not have an arrow?
[320:30.81]Why does it have to be a star?
[320:32.26]Like, what?
[320:33.58]Why not a pointing arrow?
[320:36.64]I need the arrow to point in the direction that I need to go.
[320:39.32]I need a GTA thing up here.
[320:42.78]Don't fall off this.
[320:43.76]I'll be extraordinarily upset.
[320:52.88]Damn, I want pizza. 206.
[321:02.74]Bomb.
[321:06.98]Just shoot the lock.
[321:14.55]It doesn't work like that.
[321:15.71]Alright.
[321:18.95]Well, he's dead.
[321:19.69]Good.
[321:20.41]Why is the music still doing this?
[321:24.04]Molotov.
[321:24.54]I have five Molotovs?
[321:26.48]Oh, but I want to... Oh, but I want the gun.
[321:28.24]Let's just have fun with them for a second.
[321:40.91]Is it it?
[321:43.89]Is it gone?
[321:44.33]I got two of two puzzles.
[321:54.52]All right.
[321:54.80]Return with the puzzle pieces to the trap entrance.
[321:56.54]Where the hell was that?
[321:57.34]Who knows?
[321:57.72]I feel like I'm playing Resident Evil, but just not even close.
[322:12.22]Have a good night.
[322:13.04]Good night.
[322:13.92]Should we do a good night?
[322:14.70]Should I leave?
[322:15.12]You guys want me to go?
[322:19.36]You want me to leave?
[322:19.98]Alright, where the hell is the trap entrance?
[322:28.87]Here, I guess?
[322:36.06]You're at the end.
[322:36.84]I feel like I am at the end.
[322:40.85]You know what?
[322:41.59]I'm definitely in.
[322:44.22]Can't give up now.
[322:47.38]Should get pizza.
[322:48.02]Yeah, I'm gonna get a big pizza.
[322:51.14]The biggest pizza you've ever seen.
[322:52.28]30 minutes max.
[322:58.96]Okay.
[323:01.82]Quick, I want a fall joke.
[323:03.89]I don't think you're gonna get one of those.
[323:07.66]Fall drop requires a checkpoint that is within about five seconds of my last attempt.
[323:17.07]This way.
[323:20.63]Backtrack and bullshit.
[323:24.19]Is that an explosive?
[323:28.41]No, it's just stairs.
[323:29.99]I just saw a line and I freaked out.
[323:36.62]Wait, open this.
[323:41.38]Oh my god.
[323:41.78]Oh, you're killing people.
[323:44.54]You are absolutely murdering.
[323:46.30]You're slaughtering people.
[323:48.62]Oh.
[324:09.63]It's two heels.
[324:10.27]I feel like... Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[324:12.62]The gas is going to fill the room.
[324:15.28]Where is it?
[324:15.56]Where is it?
[324:15.82]Where, where, where, where, where, where?
[324:19.28]Where is it?
[324:19.80]The gas is going to fill this whole fucking room.
[324:22.96]Come on.
[324:23.96]Where is it?
[324:24.38]I knew it.
[324:24.66]I told you.
[324:25.08]I did it on purpose.
[324:31.49]I did it on purpose.
[324:31.97]That was on purpose.
[324:32.79]I did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose.
[324:33.95]That was on purpose.
[324:35.09]I knew it because I wanted to fucking... Let's go.
[324:39.31]That was on purpose.
[324:40.79]On purpose.
[324:42.77]Wasn't pretending, on purpose.
[324:44.95]Fuck, and the checkpoint's right there.
[324:51.28]Where... Where is this fucking thing?
[324:55.66]Take it, please.
[325:04.08]No, get...
[325:06.98]Okay, next up is... Oh, I don't know, man.
[325:11.85]How the fuck am I supposed to know?
[325:13.13]Um... What the hell?
[325:19.73]That's not right.
[325:27.12]Oh, that's it!
[325:27.62]That's it!
[325:30.96]What happened?
[325:31.52]Why is it not doing it?
[325:35.20]Oh, it's not correct.
[325:44.96]Do another one!
[325:45.70]Do another one!
[325:46.64]Do another one!
[325:47.80]X!
[325:48.86]What do you do?
[325:49.94]I'm hitting the button X. The button fucking X!
[325:53.54]X button!
[325:54.93]Okay.
[325:55.75]You decide to do it now.
[325:59.33]What happened here?
[326:00.07]Oh, you piece of fucking absolute dog shit.
[326:09.08]Really?
[326:09.48]Really?
[326:30.21]It's like right fucking there.
[326:32.02]It's so close, but it's just so fucking far away at the same time.
[326:41.47]Just kill me, motherfucker.
[326:43.93]Imagine putting this in the game like more than five times.
[327:03.14]Imagine not going inside out.
[327:04.58]I fucking forgot it was in the room.
[327:16.16]I fucking hate this.
[327:18.45]I need that major prize.
[327:21.33]I'm not vetoing it.
[327:22.07]No, no, no.
[327:22.59]Nope.
[327:23.15]No, I got it.
[327:23.75]I got it.
[327:24.01]I'm gonna calm down.
[327:25.93]I'm gonna settle down.
[327:27.67]This is gas and booby trap.
[327:31.13]This is not even soft.
[327:33.39]This is fucking Kevin McAllister does this shit.
[327:36.41]Not jigsaw.
[327:39.44]Okay, let's go.
[327:44.86]Inside out.
[327:53.79]I don't even know what inside out should even be.
[328:02.69]All I see is shapes.
[328:03.99]I don't see anything else.
[328:04.81]All I see is shapes.
[328:06.47]I don't see anything else but shapes.
[328:09.05]It's just shapes.
[328:10.35]Nothing else.
[328:11.99]Why would I go inside out?
[328:19.34]Outside in?
[328:20.12]That's what I was doing.
[328:25.66]Why would you tell me to go inside out?
[328:27.40]That's not right.
[328:34.95]That's not right either.
[328:37.39]That's not right either.
[328:40.17]That's right.
[328:40.55]This is the one.
[328:41.11]This is the one.
[328:41.49]Okay.
[328:41.59]This is the one.
[328:43.11]Okay.
[328:43.31]All right.
[328:43.67]All right.
[328:43.91]All right.

[328:49.12]Fucking heal.
[328:51.42]Heal.
[328:52.02]Use it.
[329:02.32]Get me the fuck out of here!
[329:03.08]I don't want to do this again!
[329:04.16]Oh!
[329:09.02]Okay.
[329:09.48]I don't even care.
[329:11.82]I don't even want to look at it.
[329:13.42]I'm going.
[329:13.82]I don't even want to look at it.
[329:14.54]I don't even care.
[329:15.22]Where's my lighter?
[329:22.33]Now what?
[329:22.79]Over here?
[329:23.15]Okay, now we have made it.
[329:28.33]Then go left.
[329:32.13]Solve the puzzle to open the trap door.
[329:33.67]Solve the puzzle.
[329:40.84]Solve the puzzle.
[329:41.68]Solve the puzzle.
[329:42.90]Find the truth.
[329:45.92]Okay.
[329:47.40]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[329:52.96]No, no, not these.
[329:54.40]Not one of these.
[329:56.64]Wait, it's the brainless version.
[329:59.74]Thank God it's a brainless version.
[330:05.70]Holy shit, I'm so happy that this is just an absolute moron edition.
[330:08.68]Where's this other piece of his face?
[330:13.12]Where's his face?
[330:22.77]I don't even... Where's the piece of his face?
[330:24.94]Where's his other cheek?
[330:27.00]There it is.
[330:33.23]This is the wrong spot.
[330:35.22]Hold on, let me just get it right.
[330:36.00]Okay, and then... Is Saw in a wheelchair?
[330:48.26]I don't remember.
[330:51.06]Is he?
[331:10.21]Now we gotta do, uh, where does this piece go?
[331:12.01]Okay, now we gotta go right here.
[331:21.95]And then, uh, his shoulder.
[331:32.69]All right.
[331:33.91]Then this piece goes over here.
[331:35.35]No, it doesn't.
[331:36.03]Where's the shoulder go?
[331:36.93]Right here.
[331:37.25]Then this piece, I don't know.
[331:40.43]It's got like a, I don't know.
[332:02.18]Alright, and then this goes over here, and this goes right here, and this goes here.
[332:09.99]Goes down here, and this goes, uh, over here.
[332:21.53]I win.
[332:22.53]Time to find the truth.
[332:23.25]This is the end of the game.
[332:27.48]Has to be.
[332:41.64]Four minutes for this.
[332:42.70]And why'd you do that, man?
[333:17.66]Wait, who?
[333:18.38]Who is supposed to do that?
[333:20.30]Was he supposed to do this?
[333:22.10]Get up.
[333:47.65]I'm an asshole.
[333:48.25]What do you think I'm doing?
[333:49.15]Where's the power source?
[334:11.19]It's complicated, Frank.
[334:12.31]Whatever your name is, it's hard to do.
[334:17.27]Why is everybody so rude?
[334:35.78]I'm going as fast as I can Okay, and then this now has to be changed better than this
[334:47.61]And, um... This is not correct.
[334:51.43]It's gotta be connected.
[334:57.21]Yep, you're alright.
[334:59.47]Stay tight.
[335:00.49]Hang tight there for a sec.
[335:01.41]Okay.
[335:03.69]Um... And, uh...
[335:11.57]Okay.
[335:12.89]Oh my god.

[335:20.38]You think this is a joke?
[335:35.03]Uh...
[335:42.72]And then this goes here, and then this goes down, and this goes down.
[335:47.05]This one goes like this, and then up here.
[335:52.57]This connects down here like this.
[335:53.85]This goes like this, now this goes like that.
[335:56.41]Yeah, this goes like this.
[335:57.13]It connects over there, and then it connects up here.

[338:04.06]Then walk over there and do that line puzzle.
[338:05.70]Then do that line puzzle.
[338:06.83]Then do this line puzzle.
[338:07.91]A waste of time.
[338:09.75]That was a waste of time.
[338:18.77]Go.
[338:33.31]Connect!
[338:34.19]Connect!
[338:34.47]Hurry up and connect!
[338:39.27]Shut up!

[341:13.49]How do you... Wait.
[341:16.36]What are you doing here?
[341:17.68]The killer is loose because of you.
[341:19.18]Because you didn't catch him.
[341:20.74]Oswald, listen.
[341:21.72]Did you see what he looked like?
[341:23.32]Anything.
[341:24.62]Saved by a scumbag like you.
[341:27.02]Dirty cop.
[341:27.58]What did he look like?
[341:29.83]I don't know.
[341:30.39]I remember checking my mail and going to get some water and maybe I... He's just listening.
[341:35.27]He's just right there.
[341:39.17]I think I know who Jigsaw is.
[341:41.09]I think he's in this place.
[341:42.85]We just need to find him.
[341:46.12]Omega Lull.
[341:52.94]Asia.
[341:57.34]There's more to this?

[342:21.04]I know.
[342:21.56]I know.
[342:21.80]The developers thought it was real cute to put this shit everywhere.
[342:25.39]I know.

[342:29.93]He did.
[342:43.81]Is it safe to go down here?
[342:51.72]Dude, explain the glass.
[342:54.36]The RC cars that are on the fucking ground.
[342:58.74]Oh, no.
[343:05.16]He wants to experience my games.
[343:16.14]I don't know about this.
[343:18.68]I don't know about this.
[343:19.54]I don't know about this.
[343:21.21]I thought you said I had 30 minutes left.
[343:29.04]What was that?
[343:29.88]Was it just bullshit?
[343:39.04]Pick up stun trap schematics.
[343:40.74]I already have this.
[343:42.50]You give me shit I've already gotten.
[343:44.58]Flashlight, thank god.
[343:47.65]Never put this down.
[343:48.29]Don't touch that.
[343:55.23]Just three more boss puzzles?
[344:04.62]Be real with me here, is that true?
[344:11.87]Correct.
[344:12.49]Wait, there's like five more hours left.
[344:17.72]One more.
[344:18.28]This is it.
[344:18.64]What do you mean?
[344:19.44]Nobody actually knows.
[344:25.24]Stop listening to these people and play the game.
[344:27.97]Okay.
[344:38.78]What was that?
[344:39.96]Eep.
[344:40.32]Eep.
[344:41.10]Eep.
[344:41.58]Eep.
[344:42.19]Let's call it an explode.
[344:51.15]He's dead.
[344:56.49]Locate the crematorium.
[344:57.43]We're to the second floor.
[345:02.71]I'm standing on the objective right now.
[345:04.72]This is the crematorium or something.
[345:06.50]I don't know.
[345:09.11]I have to turn this steam off.
[345:20.08]Actually, three more.
[345:21.08]Oh, mega lull.
[345:21.96]Actually, three more.
[345:22.90]Actually, three more.
[345:23.82]Whatever.
[345:24.54]Get to the second.
[345:29.78]How do I turn this shit off?
[345:35.17]I got the key.
[345:35.79]I just have to go down.
[345:41.06]Ten hours left.
[345:45.40]I have played this.
[345:46.04]There's only one more.
[345:46.92]Wait, wasn't I just down here?
[345:51.37]What's going on?
[345:56.35]Oh.
[345:57.41]I don't think so.
[345:58.79]You.
[346:01.95]Secret chest over here.
[346:13.77]I looked it up.
[346:16.56]Two to three hours left, man.
[346:18.18]I'll keep this.
[346:21.44]Fuck the gun.
[346:38.28]I've played it.
[346:38.74]There's like another at least hour or two.
[346:40.44]Oh well.
[346:43.28]I'm gonna get to the end and fucking quit the game, aren't I?
[346:47.44]I'm gonna get to the very end and I'm gonna quit the game.
[346:49.52]I got- I have to follow the rules though.
[346:55.88]No streaming past six hours.
[346:57.96]That's the- that's a rule.
[346:59.28]I can't break it.
[347:00.16]I have to medically, uh... But I can't just take a minor prize.
[347:13.63]Because you bet your ass I'm never opening this game again.
[347:16.27]I'm not going to play this game again.
[347:17.59]Why would I do that?
[347:18.31]What's this?
[347:30.00]What's that?
[347:37.24]I can't even make it.
[347:43.03]Play it tomorrow.
[347:43.99]No, I think you're misunderstanding me.
[347:46.25]I don't want to play this game again.
[347:47.83]Like, I don't want to play this game.
[347:49.87]Oh, just do it tomorrow.
[347:50.81]No, I don't want to play this game again.
[347:52.27]This is one and done, man.
[347:54.51]I don't want... The camera.
[348:03.76]Okay, the crematorium.
[348:06.72]What's the code you gave to me?
[348:07.94]I don't care.
[348:08.72]Somebody has to know it.
[348:14.80]Somebody has to know this code.
[348:16.86]You guys have probably read ahead in the guide like three hours already.
[348:19.70]What is it?
[348:22.98]No, tell me.
[348:23.48]Tell me.
[348:23.84]Don't tell him.
[348:24.34]Tell him.
[348:24.86]Tell me.
[348:25.67]I don't care.
[348:26.05]I'm not going to go look for this.
[348:29.37]Seven.
[348:34.67]We have not.
[348:35.31]Somebody did.
[348:40.51]Chat can't do it.
[348:41.56]Yes, they can.
[348:42.02]Not 420.
[348:43.04]Okay.
[348:46.73]589?
[348:46.75]Stop trusting chat.
[348:54.76]It's actually 420.
[348:56.98]Is it?
[348:57.52]It's 420?
[348:58.00]It's 420.
[348:58.54]Okay.
[348:59.30]If it's not 420, you're in big trouble.
[349:03.82]All of you.
[349:04.40]Collectively.
[349:05.68]You're all in trouble now.
[349:06.90]All of you.
[349:07.22]Purge the chat.
[349:09.14]Just once.
[349:09.54]Just to let them know.
[349:20.98]Seven what?
[349:24.98]Six.
[349:33.01]Who needs to play the game?
[349:35.27]Who needs to play the game when you can just fucking cheat?
[349:39.50]Who's me?
[349:40.44]You?
[349:41.68]You're dead.
[349:46.50]Okay, good.
[349:48.04]Premitorium.
[349:52.25]Oh, this is just like, I'm a half-life guy.
[350:02.89]Uh-oh.
[350:07.27]Okay, the trap.
[350:09.83]Ooh, Molotov.
[350:21.38]Oh, the security door.
[350:22.28]I'm just... Let's go.
[350:30.03]You know what I mean?
[350:31.83]Like, let's go.
[350:33.69]I don't want to listen to any more TV bullshit.
[350:44.34]No one wants to do these.
[350:47.62]Have you ever woken up
[350:50.07]and just you brush your teeth and shit and you get ready and you're like you know what I would love to do today it's like electricity pipe puzzle thing the thing that like nobody's wanted to do since like the fucking 80s nobody wants to play this nobody wants to do this no one wants to play this nobody
[351:15.55]I do.
[351:15.79]No, you don't.
[351:16.29]No, you really don't.
[351:16.89]I know you don't.
[351:18.47]I'm certain that you don't.
[351:19.50]I'm positive.
[351:20.92]You don't have to pretend with me.
[351:22.92]I know.
[351:36.50]This has got to be connected up here.
[351:37.80]Okay, open the fucking door.
[351:41.18]I have this app on my phone.
[351:42.20]It's pretty fun.
[351:43.28]Yeah, you probably played it once.
[351:45.09]And then you just uninstalled it and you were like, oh, that was fun for five minutes.
[351:50.55]Those things are like a fun little, like, in the newspaper brain teaser.
[351:54.54]Who wants to do this?
[351:59.76]Yeah, no, that's true.
[352:00.56]Yeah, you did install that.
[352:02.18]Played it, and then you realized there was an ad every fucking two games, and you were like, I don't want to play this anymore.
[352:06.70]I'm done.
[352:07.56]Why would I want to watch a 30-second ad every time I do a five-minute puzzle?
[352:11.50]No thanks.
[352:14.39]Oh, the TV turned on.
[352:18.57]I made this game, but you didn't.
[352:20.83]I did.
[352:22.67]Liar.
[352:28.63]Alright, press the button!
[352:35.69]Now we turn on the electricity, we just electrocute the guy.
[352:37.63]There's gonna be a guy over here and he's gonna freak out and break through a wall.
[352:42.62]Then I can electrocute him.
[352:43.56]Electrocute him.
[352:43.98]Why even like- Just hit him in the head.
[352:58.31]What?
[352:59.15]I don't know.
[353:12.74]Oh no, you've attracted a guy.
[353:15.89]Careful, there's a guy coming.
[353:18.23]He's scared.
[353:22.55]By a surgeon's hand.
[353:30.03]Flashlight, already got it.
[353:31.99]Back point.
[353:33.49]Locate the crematorium.
[353:35.81]It's this way.
[353:36.80]Eh, sorry.
[353:40.48]You gotta fucking go around in a circle.
[353:48.94]Blocked.
[353:55.05]One of these guys again.
[353:58.13]Anybody behind me?
[354:02.85]Okay, well, open the door and just let the guy get... Let's try.
[354:09.39]This guy's not going to attack me while I'm doing a puzzle, right?
[354:12.72]He wouldn't, like, attack a man while he's doing a puzzle, right?
[354:15.04]No, you wouldn't.
[354:19.62]Okay.
[354:20.78]I already have one of these.
[354:35.46]Okay.
[354:38.44]Why am I opening everything?
[354:39.38]It's a waste of time.
[354:42.87]I don't know.
[354:43.95]Sometimes there's like valves in this shit that I need to pick up.
[354:54.32]Fine, I won't.
[354:55.02]Let's go.
[354:57.21]Fine, there's nothing there.
[354:57.95]You're right.
[354:58.89]So what's the point?
[355:00.51]It's gonna be... Where am I going?
[355:04.29]X marks the spot.
[355:11.30]Press the button?
[355:12.00]Is it gonna explode?
[355:28.42]Standing a little close.
[355:40.33]What's even in there?
[355:40.97]There's nothing in this.
[355:43.47]It's empty.
[355:44.03]Why'd you do that?
[355:59.33]Alright.
[356:08.21]The fuck are you thinking, man?
[356:11.63]Get away from me, please!
[356:15.08]Stop that closet door!
[356:21.22]He's dead?
[356:26.45]He should explode by now, right?
[356:29.91]Okay, he had to have exploded.
[356:30.99]Yeah, there he is.
[356:37.05]Alright.
[356:41.39]X mark?
[356:41.79]I gotta go to that X or something.
[356:45.19]Or... I don't know.
[356:48.63]Um... This is... I like this part.
[356:52.57]Okay, slow.
[356:52.97]Slow.
[356:55.62]And then I'll break the wall.
[356:56.66]And there's the X. Okay, found it.
[357:09.20]That's a pretty good run.
[357:10.78]Pretty quick, pretty good speed run on this.
[357:21.15]Here's the body.
[357:21.71]Strip wire.
[357:23.17]I got a pair of scissors.
[357:26.19]Cool.
[357:29.21]And then... Frozen hand.
[357:31.47]Surgeon hand holds a key.
[357:32.93]I don't even... I don't know what that even is.
[357:41.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[357:44.02]Whatever you say.
[357:49.81]Yep, yep, yep.
[357:50.85]You're so... You're so crazy and stuff.
[357:54.00]I know.
[357:54.46]Interesting.
[358:02.90]Scissors in the head.
[358:05.12]Yeah, he missed a secret room.
[358:10.16]Six to seven rooms back.
[358:11.22]No, don't care.
[358:11.82]Alright, where's the next one?
[358:16.11]How much of this... What?
[358:18.49]What is all this?
[358:23.71]I gotta go.
[358:25.25]Oh, no.
[358:26.71]No, I don't.
[358:28.67]I don't want to do that.
[358:33.47]Please.
[358:35.01]Just close behind me.
[358:35.83]Oh, something wrong with you.
[358:41.17]Thanks.
[358:41.37]Uh, bye.
[358:44.75]Then you need to leave.
[358:45.53]I can't leave.
[358:47.47]I'm locked.
[358:49.78]I'm stuck here.
[358:53.77]I'm stuck.
[358:54.95]I'm trapped here just like a real jigsaw.
[358:59.49]Think of your health.
[359:22.85]yeah yeah but I have I can't oh I didn't even tell you guys that I did pre-stream but that don't even pre-stream is oh I forgot to mention all this we're gonna talk about this um I have I forgot to talk about this uh so okay never enough gas in here
[359:51.57]I don't know how to activate the circuit breaker.
[359:59.79]Watch your step, detective.
[360:04.17]All right.
[360:04.67]I'll see you tomorrow.
[360:06.07]I can't scream tomorrow.
[360:10.73]I can't.
[360:11.11]All right.
[360:14.22]Alright, I gotta go.
[360:15.12]I can't.
[360:15.56]My health is important.
[360:16.48]I gotta take care of myself.
[360:17.34]Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[360:19.52]You ready?
[360:20.74]This is the deal.
[360:21.76]You ready for the deal?
[360:27.42]Community content night's gonna be Thursday.
[360:29.75]Easy bake oven Friday.
[360:30.79]Green screen on Saturday.
[360:33.95]But before or after community content night I'm gonna finish this game.
[360:45.41]I want to see the end.
[360:48.19]After community content night.
[360:49.43]Because the community night only takes... Usually what?
[360:53.46]Like three or four hours?
[360:54.66]Something like that?
[360:56.90]That's fine.
[360:58.30]Probably another hour or two in the game, right?
[361:02.08]This game sucks.
[361:04.45]Don't finish it.
[361:06.49]But I made that thing about the major prize.
[361:08.87]And that's really in my head right now.
[361:12.09]So... I...
[361:15.39]kind of kind of there but I'll see you guys on thursday community content night we'll finish this I can't stream tomorrow I can't I've got this way too I have to I have I don't even have like half of like the costumes I need for the next three days I gotta I gotta do it

[361:57.75]We'll do community content night.
[361:58.79]We're gonna finish this.
[361:59.45]Maybe I'll just completely forget about this and not even care.
[362:03.05]I probably will.
[362:05.55]But we're gonna end the stream.
[362:09.57]I'm gonna do the bits fast because I've gotta get out of here.

[362:26.10]Fuck.
[362:26.38]Idiot.

[363:20.93]PeacefulHaley, thanks for the 250.
[363:22.54]Jeremy, you're definitely going to love this game.
[363:24.44]It's great with a Pepe laughing face.
[363:26.72]The game sucks.
[363:27.84]So, I mean, it is fun though.
[363:29.45]It does have its moments.
[363:31.24]Captain Kitten, thanks for the $5.
[363:32.80]Mr. 985, it's my birthday today.
[363:34.97]With everything going on in the world, I'm stuck at home.
[363:37.57]Fortunately, I got you in chat to keep me company.
[363:39.15]Thanks for all the work you put into your streams.
[363:40.37]Really looking forward to the green screen DLC for free.
[363:42.45]I added the for free part, but I had to make sure to make that very, very importantly added note there.
[363:46.46]Happy birthday, Captain Kitten.
[363:48.56]Thanks for the $5.
[363:51.88]Prove that it's not Thursday.
[363:52.88]It's 10 o'clock Pacific time.
[363:55.16]Just look at a globe.
[364:00.16]Uh... Aura Farynx, thanks for the $5.
[364:02.64]Jerma, I was the one who mentioned I had coronavirus, and your streams were helping a lot.
[364:06.64]I want to say that I'm all healed now.
[364:10.45]Thanks again for lifting my spirits during that time.
[364:12.17]Hope you're doing well.
[364:12.89]Glad to hear it.
[364:18.37]Scary shit.
[364:23.39]Hopefully you were very well taken care of, and I'm glad to hear that you're doing well.
[364:32.27]Cheers to your recovery.
[364:33.85]Thank you.
[364:34.61]For the $5.
[364:34.99]Ghost Story, the first.
[364:39.31]Thanks for $20.
[364:41.01]That's a lot of money.
[364:42.61]Thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[364:43.79]Say, Mr. Jerma985, do you remember me?
[364:46.15]Your response here.
[364:47.39]I bet you thought you'd never see me again.
[364:49.29]Thanks for being so nice to me.
[364:50.21]I appreciate it so much.
[364:51.61]I'd like to give you what I've won here tonight.

[365:06.37]Your response here.

[365:51.00]I really hope stuff turns around for you.
[365:56.72]Thanks for hanging out.
[365:58.76]And that's a long time to even think that the e-clown guy here is still funny.
[366:03.81]Seven years is a long time.
[366:08.07]Thanks a lot.
[366:10.29]I wish you the best.
[366:10.89]Take care of yourself.
[366:12.95]He's a sicko.
[366:13.77]I'm a sicko.
[366:14.45]Sicko streamer.
[366:15.17]Why?
[366:15.43]What the fuck are you talking about?
[366:17.43]Stains, thanks for $3.
[366:18.33]Jeremiah, I need some help.
[366:19.81]Okay, let's see if I can help you.
[366:21.27]Starting lightning round.
[366:22.99]Recently, I've been having dreams where the guy from Dirty Jobs shows up swinging a ball-peen hammer at me.
[366:28.09]I think I have micro-peen issues.
[366:33.12]Do you happen to know how to make it stop?
[366:37.54]Did you just make me say micro-penis?
[366:41.00]He did.
[366:42.02]Congratulations.
[366:43.38]Professor Plaid, thanks for the $5.
[366:45.18]Don't use weapons in this game.
[366:46.49]Fists are much better.
[366:47.67]It's actually kind of real.
[366:52.55]I think you would jam-a-get for the $3.
[366:58.31]Hi, Jerma.
[366:59.01]I'll be asleep by the time you get around to reading this.
[367:00.99]I'm in the UK.
[367:02.51]But I'll be watching the VOD when I can.
[367:04.53]I'm in the last week of university, and your VODs have been keeping me sane.
[367:08.91]This is the first time I've been able to watch live, so I thought I'd send you some appreciation for what little money I have to celebrate.
[367:15.76]Cue you talking about not giving money, but shut up.
[367:18.04]You've done more for me than you'll know.
[367:19.90]Thank you for being you.
[367:21.32]Alright.
[367:22.16]Okay, alright.
[367:22.84]I will shut up.
[367:24.24]Make sure you don't get an effing pickleball like I did.
[367:29.69]I wish you the best.
[367:30.75]Good luck.
[367:32.11]And potential, you know, you know, preliminary congratulations on your passing of your university year.
[367:42.38]What is pickleball?
[367:43.16]Well, it's the most fun sport in the world.
[367:46.36]Snooze and Coffin, thanks for 250.
[367:47.44]I recently finished God of War 2018 and it was so good.
[367:50.08]Did you ever play it off stream?
[367:51.30]I did.
[367:53.12]And then I got four or five hours in.
[367:55.62]Maybe I was a little more than that.
[367:57.32]It's probably like eight hours in.
[367:59.52]And I stopped.
[368:02.36]But that first, like, two hours is one of the most fun I think I've ever played in a video game that was single player.
[368:08.10]That first hour of God of War was like, holy shit, this is insane.
[368:10.92]This is the most insane game I've ever played.
[368:12.44]And then it was just a video game after that.
[368:16.26]But that's not a bad thing.
[368:17.36]It was a very, very high quality video game.
[368:23.89]Like, I would probably say that if I had a brain that actually functioned well on a daily basis, that that would probably be one of the best single-player games that have come out in a long time.
[368:36.07]Although I only have about 12 hours, potentially, of experience in a game that's about twice that.
[368:45.09]I can only imagine all the perfect joke opportunities to do an Irish accent, the rage-induced moments during Valkyrie fights in the story.
[368:51.65]Yeah, um... Ah, this is bad.
[368:54.05]I have to tell you this.
[368:56.67]I got halfway.
[368:57.36]I got like 12 hours into the game.
[368:58.82]And then I just stopped playing for like... A couple months went by.
[369:03.26]And then I just read every spoiler.
[369:05.94]On like the Wikipedia page.
[369:09.26]Sorry.
[369:13.07]But whatever.
[369:14.17]It's still cool.
[369:16.43]It's still a really cool game.
[369:20.07]I found my perfect keyboard, low profile and quiet.
[369:22.77]It's $170.
[369:22.89]I have difficulty justifying an investment like that.
[369:26.17]Help.
[369:27.87]Get an Amazon Basics fucking $10 keyboard.
[369:29.77]Save yourself 1,700%.
[369:33.53]Wait, is that correct?
[369:36.17]Maybe.
[369:38.26]Get an Amazon Basics fucking $9 keyboard.
[369:40.32]Who cares?
[369:41.38]They all do the same thing.
[369:52.49]Good keyboards are worth it.
[369:53.45]Yeah, but you could just get a $9 Amazon Basics keyboard and fucking save $1,000 or whatever it was.
[369:59.75]X Whimsical Moose.
[370:00.73]Thanks for $2.50.
[370:01.43]By the way, I'm a hypocrite, asshole, lying fuckface.
[370:04.64]I have a Corsair.
[370:05.96]Listen to this.
[370:06.38]You ready for this one?
[370:08.16]Oh, whoa.
[370:08.80]Amazon Basics keyboard.
[370:09.92]What's...
[370:11.52]That, that's, that's not an Amazon Basics keyboard anymore, is it?
[370:17.25]It's a Corsair fucking keyboard.
[370:18.45]I got a, I got the Corsair.
[370:19.39]Remember the one that I dumped the drink on?
[370:20.83]Yeah, I got that same one, because it was my favorite keyboard.
[370:23.15]I got it, I cracked.
[370:24.05]Get an Amazon Basics keyboard, they're $9.
[370:25.41]Uh, thank you xWhimsicalMoose for the $2.50.
[370:31.43]Hello, Jeremiah.
[370:32.13]First donation.
[370:32.65]I'm 28 years old.
[370:33.49]Why was I just going to say happy birthday?
[370:36.58]Like today?
[370:37.90]Wait, no.
[370:38.38]I'm fucking that up.
[370:40.28]I just want to say, not all your fans are these dang Zoomers.
[370:45.83]I didn't grow up with you, and you haven't saved my life.
[370:48.58]But you're one of the few e-clowns from when I was 19 or 20 that's still watchable and even funnier than you used to be.
[370:54.30]Even if you never beat Stalker's Shadow of Chernobyl, keep it up.
[370:58.42]Also, play Exanima.
[371:00.38]You played it in 2015, so I know you own it.
[371:03.38]And it's updated a ton since then.
[371:05.36]You can be a wizard now.
[371:07.66]I made a video on Exanima.
[371:12.40]Maybe I'll go back to it one day.
[371:14.36]Put it on the list.
[371:18.83]It's at least one person's birthday today.
[371:20.87]Yeah, they've already we've already seen them.
[371:22.47]They've already been here Play that instead of finishing saw That was a common rider based Thank you, but X whimsical moose gave 250 I didn't even read this I
[371:43.92]Hey Jerma, I love this game and its sequel for how funny bad it is.
[371:47.39]Also, you always tell us to keep safe, but I was wondering how you, Kim, and Otto are doing.
[371:51.31]Also, I'm hype about this weekend's streams and stay safe chat.
[371:55.99]We're doing good.
[371:59.26]We'll see how it goes here over the next few weeks.
[372:01.90]Nevada, the stay-at-home order in Nevada is gone.
[372:07.54]We've entered phase one of reopening.
[372:12.15]Hopefully it's not going to cause a big problem.
[372:15.23]I know some restaurants are starting to open up again a little bit.
[372:18.15]Some other businesses are starting to open.
[372:20.93]Casinos are all still closed.
[372:23.35]The strip is still closed and it will be probably for a pretty long time.
[372:26.79]I can't imagine any of those properties are going to open up until June, July.
[372:33.77]Who knows?
[372:34.21]It depends on how this goes.
[372:40.58]But yeah, we're doing alright.
[372:42.68]We're doing just fine.
[372:44.82]Trying to stay as safe as possible.
[372:47.24]Trying to take care of each other.
[372:48.24]Take care of Otto, obviously.
[372:50.32]Yeah, we're doing good.
[372:55.27]Pump.
[372:56.63]Punk Pikachu, thanks for the $4.
[372:59.17]Yesterday at Walmart, they played I'm Han Solo.
[373:02.43]And I felt the need to tell you how famous you've gotten.
[373:06.63]Anyways, love your streams.
[373:07.69]They make me laugh no matter how much time has passed.
[373:12.81]Wait, I didn't make the Han Solo song.
[373:19.12]They played I'm Han, but that's not my song.
[373:25.30]I danced to it like three years after it was a meme.
[373:31.79]And like after five YouTubers made jokes about it.
[373:34.51]I think I was a little late to that party.
[373:42.27]No need to be so modest.
[373:43.41]Alright, fine, I wrote the song.
[373:44.55]No, I didn't.
[373:45.11]I can't fucking say that.
[373:45.93]That's bad.
[373:46.71]I didn't do that.
[373:47.20]Because that guy didn't.
[373:50.46]And somebody would be like, wait, what if you fucking actually wrote it and you were sitting here right now and you're listening to this asshole?
[373:56.06]Hey, Wembley TTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[373:57.77]I really hope that I never put it in a saw-like contraption.
[374:01.89]And Jerma has to take over to save my life.
[374:04.51]I'd rather take my own chances.
[374:05.91]Thank you.
[374:09.21]Well, I opened the door and shot the guy in the last one, so, I mean, there's a good point there.
[374:15.05]Hey, MostlyToastedToast, thanks for $3.
[374:17.19]I'm starting to feel like this game isn't about cutting things.
[374:21.94]BakeMeHome, thanks for $3.
[374:23.40]Jeremiah, it's been forever since I watched live.
[374:26.08]Therefore, it's been forever since I've given bits.
[374:28.42]I must make the opportunity count.
[374:30.62]I will... And it's a blank.
[374:34.50]To continue recording this message.
[374:35.94]Cheer, another 100 bits.
[374:39.15]Shit, Will.
[374:40.65]See if you end up putting another $2.50 in there.
[374:44.99]Hey, OneBlondie, thanks for the $9.90.
[374:46.32]I'm making a D&D wizard.
[374:48.66]Do you want to name him?
[374:49.56]He likes illusions.
[374:52.78]Sure.
[374:58.28]Spark.
[375:03.92]See-through.
[375:05.78]S-E-A.
[375:09.94]No space.
[375:11.12]T-H-R-O-U-U, apostrophe.
[375:17.16]There you go.
[375:25.37]Yeah, see-through.
[375:30.22]That's fucking good.
[375:31.88]I mean, terrible.
[375:36.45]Okay, so see-through is terrible, but Hellscream is the greatest character ever made and the best name ever made ever for any character ever.
[375:45.25]Okay.
[375:54.86]Hellscream.
[375:56.78]See-through.
[375:57.22]Alright, it's pretty bad.
[375:58.76]It's bad.
[375:59.16]It's worse than Hellscream, but not that much worse.
[376:01.68]I would put them next to each other and it would be hard to tell.
[376:05.78]Hey, BS!
[376:08.02]Hey, bbs88, bs88.
[376:11.55]Unit, thanks for the $15.
[376:14.23]No message, just $15.
[376:16.01]Just dropped on my lap.
[376:17.27]I'll take it.
[376:17.67]Thank you.
[376:19.47]mty98, 1,000 bits, $10.
[376:21.96]Just given to me.
[376:22.66]No message, just 1,000 bits.
[376:24.06]I'll take the $10.
[376:24.86]It's a lot of money.
[376:25.48]Thank you.
[376:27.20]Shittyviewbot, another 1,000 bits, $10.
[376:29.76]What even made you want to play this game today?
[376:33.80]I bought it, like, four months ago.
[376:36.66]Or five months ago or something.
[376:38.00]As I've been sitting here.
[376:39.56]I gotta play it.
[376:41.56]Gotta make time for these things.
[376:47.48]Like you shitty viewbot.
[376:49.82]Hey, me game friend, thanks for the five dollars.
[376:52.98]Don't listen to the haters, this game pogs.
[376:55.22]P.S.
[376:55.48]You need to sign in to save.
[376:58.74]Yep, figured that one out.
[377:00.56]Hey, Honey Wizard, thanks for the $3.
[377:02.16]Hey, German, I used to watch your VODs exclusively for months before going to bed until I recently started getting night terrors narrated by you.
[377:10.28]Glad to finally catch a stream while it's live.
[377:14.56]Sorry to hear that.
[377:15.14]Hey, McMuscles, thanks for the thousand bits, $10.
[377:20.62]German, why are all these puzzles shitty mobile games?
[377:23.70]I don't know.
[377:24.52]I wish I knew.
[377:26.82]A dingled jangle.
[377:28.64]Thanks for the $27.50.
[377:29.28]Almost 30 bucks.
[377:34.64]Thanks for that.
[377:36.52]All the way from Dublin.
[377:38.00]For the boy all the way out west.
[377:39.66]I'm a little teapot.
[377:41.38]See my vest, see my vest.
[377:43.73]What's that mean?
[377:44.73]Did I just read like a weird fucking weird thing?
[377:48.25]Thanks for the $30.
[377:48.77]That's huge amounts of money.
[377:55.80]Omega Lol, he read it.
[378:00.74]I don't know.
[378:01.16]I don't know what that is.
[378:02.38]And I just read it and I might have said something fucking stupid.
[378:04.92]I'm sorry.
[378:05.40]I don't know.
[378:05.98]If people write, I don't know.
[378:07.38]I don't know.
[378:08.08]I don't know.
[378:08.56]What did I just do?
[378:09.32]A Simpsons joke?
[378:12.43]That's from The Simpsons.
[378:15.37]Oh, okay.
[378:16.75]You got penis cursed.
[378:17.72]Okay, whatever you say.
[378:19.18]Thanks for the 30 bucks.
[378:20.14]It's a lot of money.
[378:21.20]Hey, anything else show?
[378:22.32]Official thanks for the $15.
[378:23.38]Jeremy, do you think that you'll look like Neil Breen when you become older?
[378:26.46]What do you think?
[378:26.98]Let's see.
[378:39.77]I don't think this link actually works.
[378:49.21]I don't think this link is a correct link.
[378:51.25]It's just a Discord and then a bunch of numbers.
[378:55.14]I don't think this is accurate.
[378:55.90]I don't think this is correct.
[379:03.92]Sorry, I can just type in his name.
[379:06.22]Let's just do that.
[379:06.80]Neil Breen.
[379:11.63]No.
[379:12.43]No, I don't think so.
[379:14.43]No, no, no.
[379:16.74]No, I had to look like this now.
[379:17.98]So, when I'm older, I don't know.
[379:21.10]Maybe somebody else.
[379:24.68]Thanks for the $15, though.
[379:29.70]Heir of the Moon, thanks for the $5.
[379:31.28]Will you play Saw 2 after this?
[379:33.92]I don't know.
[379:35.92]I don't think so, but I could get yelled at to do it.
[379:39.05]They could be like the Saw crew.
[379:42.73]I don't know.
[379:43.19]I'm sure it'll happen.
[379:46.39]Hey, S10W, slow update.
[379:47.55]Thanks for this $2.50.
[379:48.51]Jeremiah, I was having some trouble paying for your OnlyFans.
[379:51.81]So think of this donation as my month's payment.
[379:54.07]Well, that's hilarious, considering it's $30 a month.
[379:58.50]Please enable my account again so I can see the new pics.
[380:00.94]Honestly, the stuff you do is way extreme.
[380:02.88]It's way extreme for only $2.50.
[380:04.67]Anyways, peace and love.
[380:05.61]Whatever.
[380:06.79]Thanks for the... Okay.
[380:08.75]The Saw Squad.
[380:09.49]Hey, VS88, is it a unit?
[380:11.43]Thanks for the five dollars.
[380:12.31]It's amazing how funny you can make a shitty game.
[380:14.05]Cheers with hilarious morning.
[380:15.48]Good morning.
[380:15.92]You gotta be... You gotta be in... Australia?
[380:20.08]New Zealand?
[380:21.84]UK?
[380:23.26]Asia?
[380:23.64]Where?
[380:24.26]That's far.
[380:29.34]Thanks for the five dollars.
[380:30.52]Hey, thank you Zion Swazd.
[380:32.69]Thanks for the five dollars.
[380:34.59]Yo, I don't got a lot of money, sorry, but here's five for bringing joy to everyone during these hard times.
[380:39.85]Streamer.
[380:40.99]Anyway, the first and second Halo games are now on Steam.
[380:45.43]I know you said you'd never play more, but their campaigns would be better than a shit co-op reach stream on the hardest difficulty for no reason.
[380:51.97]Maybe.
[380:52.98]If the curse is too strong, though, I at least recommend any Halo OST for when we need BG music for a stream.
[380:59.78]Or at least the Serene songs.
[381:01.86]Same for the Silent Hill and Fable OSTs.
[381:07.97]I don't know why we do that.
[381:08.75]I have stopped doing that.
[381:09.53]Have you noticed?
[381:11.79]Have you noticed?
[381:17.95]Recently, games have come up and it's like, oh, easy, normal, hard, insane.
[381:22.34]And I used to be like, oh, I have to play on hard.
[381:24.30]I'm a live streamer.
[381:25.30]I have to.
[381:26.22]What are the other streamers played on?
[381:27.54]Insane mode?
[381:28.32]Oh, biting nails.
[381:30.76]I guess I'll have to.
[381:31.43]No, I don't care.
[381:32.71]Playing on fucking normal.
[381:33.53]I don't give a shit.
[381:37.63]Like, if you beat the game on Insane and, like, other streamers beat the game on Insane, good, I'm glad.
[381:42.79]I hope you fucking win.
[381:44.71]I... At this, I don't care.
[381:47.13]I'm not picking Insane on Saw.
[381:49.15]I'm not gonna do Hard Mode on Halo OST.
[381:53.21]No.
[381:55.33]Whatever, well, that's the, you're talking, right, right, right, that's not the name of the game.
[382:01.13]This isn't, okay, right, I'm stupid.
[382:06.62]Hey, Gay Wizard, thanks for the five dollars.
[382:08.60]Jeremy, I want to say that I've been a fan since, like, 2014, but this is surprisingly my first time watching a livestream.
[382:14.22]Welcome.
[382:15.30]Even though the game sucked, it was a blast watching you being part of chat.
[382:20.01]Your humor has gotten me through some dark days, and I just want to say thank you.
[382:23.13]I wish I could donate more, but anyways, Gay Rights, baby.
[382:27.63]Yeah, I don't... You don't have to give me money.
[382:32.74]I know I say this a lot, but you don't have... It's not...
[382:38.44]Don't worry about it.
[382:40.68]I really hope some of you guys are not saving up money to give me on stream.
[382:47.61]I hope that's not the case.
[382:49.25]Take care of yourselves.
[382:50.69]Take care of you.
[382:51.63]Shut up and take the money.
[382:53.03]I'm gonna, but every so often I'm gonna make sure that I'm gonna tell you this.
[383:03.78]I spent my food stamps on bits for you.
[383:06.65]Don't do that.
[383:08.07]Use it.
[383:08.67]Eat food.
[383:11.53]But thank you, though.
[383:12.11]I appreciate it.
[383:13.23]Refund all the donations, then.
[383:21.81]What, you guys think I have a button here that will just, I press it, and it just deposits all the money back to every human that's ever given money to this stream?
[383:31.32]That's, no, there are no refunds.
[383:36.46]Give me my money back.
[383:37.22]No.
[383:37.48]There's no refunds.
[383:38.18]It's in the Twitch term service.
[383:40.04]You buy bits and use them.
[383:41.48]Bits are consumed by the streamer.
[383:43.62]He eats them and he shits out money.
[383:45.87]That's how it works.
[383:53.37]Hey, Gooberry Juice.
[383:54.39]Thanks for $3.
[383:55.19]Hey, Funk King.
[383:59.81]What's with that?
[384:03.99]Why are people saying Funk King?
[384:07.57]Is that a way to say fucking?
[384:13.08]Whatever it is.
[384:16.64]Whatever.
[384:18.36]Hey, Funk King.
[384:20.37]Man, this game sucks, huh?
[384:22.53]I don't really have anything to add to that, so just thought I'd remind everyone of the good thing to come out of the Saw franchise.
[384:28.83]What a classic.
[384:31.14]Wait, is this like a movie clip of somebody getting their head ripped off?
[384:39.22]Oh, I've... This is a... It is a classic.
[384:45.07]It is.
[384:48.33]Hold on.
[384:49.75]I'm gonna... Let's... This way.
[385:02.01]It is a classic.
[385:10.34]You wanna play a little game?
[385:18.67]The video is so funny cause like how did he fall down?
[385:29.78]You wanna play a little game?
[385:31.16]Like the whole bike explodes.
[385:35.16]The bike just disintegrates underneath.
[385:42.66]I like saw her wheeling in and doing this shit.
[385:45.98]You want to play a little game?
[385:53.52]So funny.
[385:55.52]That is a classic, right?
[385:58.54]Do that for the green screen.
[385:59.78]I get like a tricycle.
[386:02.09]What the fuck?
[386:05.71]What a classic.
[386:06.21]Great stream.
[386:06.77]Nonetheless, I can always count on you.
[386:09.41]Chat, take nothing and make it funny.
[386:13.47]You can always count on you, chat, to take nothing and make it funny.
[386:16.04]What do you mean, chat?
[386:17.80]Well, me.
[386:19.52]I do that too, don't I?
[386:20.32]I do that.
[386:21.62]I do that sometimes.
[386:25.31]Hey Tobias, thanks for the thousand bits.
[386:27.07]Long time follower, first time donator.
[386:28.73]Welcome and thank you.
[386:30.25]Today's my birthday.
[386:31.05]We have a bunch of fucking birthdays.
[386:32.21]Everyone said, whose birthday was it?
[386:34.39]It's been a bummer in quarantine, but your streams have been keeping me afloat in these trying times.
[386:39.35]Thanks for being a bright part of the crazy world.
[386:42.31]You better make Chad a birthday cake with the Easy Bake Oven.
[386:46.81]I don't even know what's in that box.
[386:49.05]I know there's, I think, 12 recipes.
[386:52.42]That stream's going to suck, by the way.
[386:54.50]I need to make sure I lay that concrete down for you.
[386:58.32]I'm just going to make candies and cakes and pizzas and shit in an Easy Bake Oven.
[387:05.34]I want to make sure you guys aren't expecting anything from that.
[387:08.44]That could be Birdhouse Stream 2.
[387:12.56]And then eat it?
[387:13.00]No, I won't eat it.
[387:13.52]Disgusting.
[387:13.98]I'm way above that.
[387:19.74]But anyways, thank you for the thousand bits, and happy birthday.
[387:28.13]I will make a birthday-themed cake thing.
[387:31.21]What are you gonna do while the food is baking?
[387:35.21]Holy shit, I didn't even think about that.
[387:36.49]I don't know, like jumping jacks.
[387:38.36]Push-ups and stuff, and like stretches.
[387:41.24]I'm gonna be careful.
[387:41.80]I don't want to, like, forget that it's in there.
[387:45.32]That might happen.
[387:45.94]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[387:47.04]I gotta have, like, a... Alright.
[387:50.06]Alright.
[387:50.88]Hey, TreeFiddy, thanks for the five dollars.
[387:53.48]Thank you, Jerma, for everything.
[387:54.53]On my birthday, you were the only person I felt like I had.
[387:57.29]Having you around made things not suck so much.
[387:59.11]It seems like that's the case every time you stream.
[388:01.77]Obviously, thanks, dude.
[388:02.87]I appreciate your drive and your dedication to the community.
[388:06.03]I wish words could describe how much you've made an impact on my life.
[388:08.43]From the bottom of my heart, thank you and love you.
[388:15.80]That means a lot.
[388:19.42]But I've mentioned this before and I want to mention it again.
[388:24.56]I really hope that you can take the steps necessary to try to improve your life and hope things get better.
[388:36.85]Because I'm just a streamer on the internet.
[388:42.58]And although I can hopefully be here to have fun and have a good time with the community, I can't necessarily fix any problems that anybody has.
[388:58.63]And obviously, I know that people aren't asking me to do that.
[389:02.29]And that's never said, no one's ever like, hey, by the way, I know that there's advice questions and stuff like that, but
[389:12.90]I just hope that you can find something else that can make you happy.
[389:17.24]As well as me.
[389:18.16]As well as this community.
[389:19.26]Because that means that you're going to get healthier.
[389:26.55]You guys are really feeding his god complex.
[389:33.07]But, like, again, I say it again.
[389:35.42]I'm just a guy on the internet.
[389:38.16]That's just me.
[389:38.78]I'm just an e-clown.
[389:41.74]we're in an e-clown community and I can't necessarily help anybody with their problems and I don't necessarily want to I'm gonna be you know let's get the honesty out here because I don't know
[390:04.40]I get questions a lot about, hey, what about this?
[390:06.50]What about that?
[390:06.92]What about this?
[390:07.52]And I don't really know.
[390:08.20]I don't really have good answers a lot of the time.
[390:11.20]And I don't want to put people in the wrong path or tell people something that might not even be true.
[390:20.11]Because if you put a lot of weight in the things that I say, I don't want to be like, well, this is how you do it.
[390:23.97]This is what I do.
[390:24.71]Because in the past, I've tried to give some decent advice as best as I could.
[390:29.07]But my advice is not really that good.
[390:33.29]It's not adequate, I don't think, for what some of you guys might necessarily need.
[390:37.97]Grandma, should I change the dosage of my medication?
[390:43.89]I'll call your doctor.
[390:49.77]You should call your doctor.
[390:54.90]I'm nothing of a psychologist myself.
[391:00.60]Yeah.
[391:02.69]Don't tell me what to do.
[391:06.83]But I... Obviously, everybody in this community that's been a part of this community, even if you watch for 10 minutes, I wish you the best of health.
[391:15.22]I do.
[391:17.52]And I hope you take the steps necessary to get there.
[391:22.32]But just be careful putting a lot of weight in somebody like an online entertainer.
[391:28.65]Because I might say something that might not even be good enough.
[391:31.25]It might not be real.
[391:32.19]It might be something that's not the best advice to give somebody.
[391:36.27]And if you take that completely and you absorb all of it... It's maybe something that never should have been said in the first place.
[391:45.00]You know what I mean?
[391:45.46]Should you eat ass?
[391:46.84]Yes.
[391:54.08]Irma's not an expert at anything, even streaming.
[391:55.94]Right.
[391:56.76]Right.
[391:59.93]Flip it.
[392:01.03]Enjoy your parasites.
[392:03.21]What, from eating ass?
[392:06.55]Holy shit.
[392:07.83]Wait, did I say to do that?
[392:09.79]Did I?
[392:10.23]Oh, oh, oh.
[392:16.96]No, don't do that.
[392:18.10]Don't do that.
[392:18.68]Oh my god, that person's disgusting.
[392:20.00]But that could be real.
[392:21.56]Is that real?
[392:22.06]Alright, I've never eaten ass again.
[392:24.84]I never did.
[392:26.06]Why would you?
[392:26.72]Who does that?
[392:27.50]Somebody does.
[392:28.18]Disgrace.
[392:28.92]I do.
[392:29.39]Who does?
[392:29.81]Nobody does.
[392:30.21]Disgusting.
[392:30.79]Move on.
[392:31.97]I don't do that.
[392:32.61]I really don't.
[392:33.17]I swear to god.
[392:33.67]100%.
[392:34.21]No jokes.
[392:35.29]Don't do that.
[392:36.41]Hey, creepy teeth.
[392:37.29]Thanks for the $5.
[392:39.89]Jerma, have you ever thought about playing the Batman games?
[392:41.91]I feel like it'd be a fun stream.
[392:43.37]I'm not sure anything can ever top.
[392:44.81]I can't play Batman games because I played the ultimate Batman game where you could ghost ride the Batmobile into a wall.
[392:51.01]I'm not sure I could ever top that.
[392:52.30]Any other Batman game could do it.
[393:03.48]Let's get the credits on here.
[393:07.26]Why not, right?
[393:10.80]It was a shitload of subs.
[393:12.08]You'll see a shitload of names.
[393:13.90]They're gonna fly by very fast because there was a lot of people that was subbed today.
[393:19.52]There's lots of community subs and lots of just resubs and new subs.
[393:24.15]It's a lot of people.
[393:25.85]Good morning.
[393:26.67]I just read that person's name.
[393:27.93]First time ever.
[393:31.89]Thanks, guys.
[393:32.31]Seriously.
[393:34.65]There's a slow lightning round.
[393:35.63]We're almost done.
[393:36.85]It's been like 30 minutes.
[393:37.85]That's a quick... Okay, 30 minutes.
[393:41.24]Usually, I sit here for like 40 to an hour.
[393:46.19]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the $5.
[393:47.51]To give credit where credit is due, this game is pretty faithful to the movie.
[393:49.95]Just like the Saw puzzles in the movie, this game is stupid and tedious.
[393:59.24]Hey, Tom's up.
[394:00.24]Thanks for the $5 streamer, man.
[394:01.63]A little over eight years ago, I was finishing middle school, and I found your channel looking for tips for playing Scout.
[394:05.85]Glad you took them.
[394:07.01]Now I'm graduating college.
[394:08.79]I'm watching ever since.
[394:10.19]I still suck at Scout.
[394:11.89]Your work in the community around it mean a lot.
[394:14.07]It's been one of my few constants this whole time.
[394:15.99]Looking forward to the Easy Bake stream more than my virtual graduation that morning.
[394:20.71]You are enjoying what you do because we sure do.
[394:23.95]I am.
[394:25.63]I'm going to continue to do so as long as it's still fun.
[394:29.21]I don't have a time frame on when I'm going to stop doing this ever.
[394:33.39]Because when it's not fun anymore, that's when I'm done.
[394:36.83]That's the only fucking thing I care about.
[394:39.01]If it's not fun, I'm done.
[394:41.57]You'll know.
[394:41.99]You'll know when I'm... You'll know when it's time for me to retire.
[394:46.59]Because you'll know that I'm just... I want to take a step back because it's not really that fun for me anymore.
[394:53.07]Based on...
[394:55.77]What did you say?
[394:56.91]Hedonist?
[394:57.45]What does that word mean?
[394:59.47]I think I should know what this means.
[395:00.89]A person who believes that the pursuit of pleasure is the most important thing in life.
[395:10.32]I mean, I just don't want to pretend on stream.
[395:12.22]I don't want to fake having a good time.
[395:15.86]I can't do that shit.
[395:17.02]You think I could sit here for more than six to eight hours and pretend to have a good time?
[395:21.04]No, in ten minutes I'd be gone.
[395:24.49]No way.
[395:27.54]You pretend to be bad at games.
[395:30.78]He's exhausted.
[395:32.78]Oh, it's exhausting.
[395:39.69]If I'm not having a good time on streams consistently and I'm getting... I don't know.
[395:45.59]I don't have a plan.
[395:46.75]I just... I didn't have a plan 8 years ago.
[395:51.22]I didn't have a plan 10 years ago.
[395:52.46]I didn't have a plan 20 years ago for any of this shit.
[395:57.05]I'm just still here doing it.
[395:58.25]And that's the way it is.
[395:59.35]And it seems to have worked out alright.
[396:03.41]We'll see.
[396:07.87]And it's shocking to me that people have been here for 10 years.
[396:11.77]It's just like the Roman Empire.
[396:13.01]Yeah, and that Roman Empire crumbled, right?
[396:16.77]What happened to the Roman Empire?
[396:18.15]Okay, you want to be a hedonist from the Roman Empire?
[396:20.86]What happened to the Roman Empire?
[396:23.08]But how's my story end?
[396:27.34]They stopped having fun.
[396:28.88]Uh-oh.
[396:35.82]The Romans are extinct.
[396:41.08]It was a volcano and barbarians.
[396:43.20]Barbarians attacked.
[396:46.72]Oh.
[396:52.44]You're not the Roman Empire.
[396:57.99]Another channel is going to raid us to death.
[397:02.20]Oh.
[397:03.40]Well.
[397:06.50]Egomania.
[397:08.18]Alright, alright, we're done.
[397:09.28]We're done, we're done, we're done, we're done.
[397:12.35]Hey, Wembley TTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[397:14.29]This game is pretty much a mobile game with all these puzzles and lackluster combat.
[397:17.77]Just add in lives and pointless, non-skipping phone adverts.
[397:22.61]The most ironic thing about all this, Konami got the rights for the series to publish this.
[397:28.12]So you know they did a good job looking after the horror titles after the 2010 Looking at You Silent Hill series that's been turned into a Pachinko machine and it's dead since PT.
[397:40.87]Konami makes more money from one person sitting at one of their slot machines than a hundred people buying games.
[397:46.85]They figured that out a long time ago.
[397:48.09]Unfortunate.
[397:52.28]Uh, alright.
[397:53.02]That's the sound effect.
[397:53.78]I think that's how they made their exit?
[398:19.94]Okay, nice ending.
[398:35.20]I'm glad he gave me the TLDR here at the end.
[398:38.91]Well, I don't have a standing desk because I just got last year a brand new desk.
[398:46.79]It's very nice and it would be a shame to have to spend the money that I did on this nice desk and then replace it with another expensive desk.
[399:00.11]But what I could do is I could get one of those.
[399:04.81]But standing, I don't really like standing and doing stuff.
[399:10.94]I move around too much.
[399:11.90]I fidget all the time.
[399:12.84]And I would be gone for a second.
[399:14.54]I'd come back.
[399:15.02]I don't really like standing still.
[399:19.94]It doesn't really work for me.
[399:22.15]But your health, I know.
[399:24.69]I'm getting this figured out.
[399:25.63]Don't worry.
[399:31.45]I'm figuring it out.
[399:32.41]I'm going to get it figured out.
[399:33.46]Don't worry.
[399:36.88]Thanks for the $5.
[399:37.60]Hey, UnZeroic, thanks for the 300 bits.
[399:39.86]I'm giving you bits so you have to go through one more bit message.
[399:42.90]I'm just that evil.
[399:44.74]You're not the last one.
[399:45.50]Appreciate that evil money.
[399:49.90]Thank you, Pritzla, for the $3.
[399:52.02]Do you remember my birthday was over the weekend?
[399:53.98]Another birthday.
[399:54.42]Happy birthday.
[399:55.56]Seems like a lot of other people are in the same boat as me, so cheers to everyone in chat who are also having quarantine birthdays.
[400:02.23]Happy birthday, yeah.
[400:02.95]Happy birthday to all the quarantine birthdays.
[400:04.47]I mean, it's been a pretty decent chunk of time.
[400:10.98]From somewhere around the end of February to March, April, May.
[400:15.72]I mean, yeah, that's a whole chunk of time.
[400:17.50]There's probably a lot of people that have had their birthdays in quarantine.
[400:25.69]Thanks for the three bucks.
[400:27.55]Happy birthday.
[400:29.59]I'm incredibly humbled that you would even say something like that.
[400:31.89]It's like 500,000 people that stream on Twitch.
[400:34.49]More than that, probably.
[400:59.66]Thank you.
[401:02.04]I... Sometimes I can't fucking believe it.
[401:08.43]But, just lost your 4.0.
[401:09.77]You're gonna be alright.
[401:12.41]You're gonna be alright.
[401:14.87]I'll tell you, anything over like a 3.2, you're doing just fucking fine.
[401:19.56]You're doing just fine.
[401:25.53]I got 2.6.
[401:26.51]I should tell you.
[401:28.39]I got 2.6.
[401:30.11]Which is, what is a 2.6 GPA?
[401:31.97]BPA to grade calculator.
[401:36.13]What is it, like a C minus, C plus?
[401:43.41]Uh, 2.
[401:43.77]Dude, that's a, that's a fucking B!
[401:48.30]2.6.
[401:48.56]It's a B minus!
[401:54.48]That's fine.
[401:55.60]Dude, B minus in college, B minus on stream.
[401:59.52]Go to my Twitch metrics website.
[402:01.46]It's a B minus.
[402:04.29]Always B minus.
[402:05.51]That's fine with me.
[402:06.15]It's not a D. It's a B minus.
[402:11.59]I just typed it in.
[402:12.81]I looked it up.
[402:15.35]Hey, Ozals, thanks.
[402:16.41]Did I even run the... Yeah, I was going to say, wait, I did, right?
[402:18.47]Fucking crazy.
[402:20.13]Hey, Ozals, thanks for $250,000.
[402:23.61]Jeremy, because you stream so late, it's now my birthday.
[402:28.27]It's weird to be giving money away on my birthday, but eh.
[402:30.49]You're the best e-clown.
[402:32.07]You deserve it.
[402:33.17]The first VOD of yours I remember watching is the Firewatch Nudes video, which I laughed my ass off in 2016.
[402:39.33]I just turned 17.
[402:41.59]It's crazy how fast it goes by.
[402:44.91]Wish Orlando, me, a happy birthday.
[402:47.79]That'd be awesome.
[402:49.15]Happy birthday, Orlando.
[402:55.19]Hope you had a really, really well-aided night.
[402:58.21]It hasn't happened yet, technically, right?
[403:03.03]It streams so late, so it's your birthday now.
[403:05.97]What time is it?
[403:07.73]3 and 4 o'clock in the morning?
[403:09.15]5 in the morning?
[403:10.71]I guess it's about to happen.
[403:14.49]Happy birthday.
[403:16.73]Hey, SpaceButterfly, thanks for the thousand bits.
[403:18.62]Jerma, it's my sister's birthday today.
[403:20.74]She's a big fan of you.
[403:22.76]She loved the Titanic joke.
[403:23.96]You know the one.
[403:25.71]Say happy birthday to Sedet.
[403:28.74]Happy birthday.
[403:31.86]Oh, mega birthdays.
[403:37.57]I showed the Firewatch video to my parents.
[403:39.33]They didn't think it was funny.
[403:40.19]What the fuck is wrong with them?
[403:42.65]Don't show your parents that video.
[403:44.63]Why would you... What's your context to show your parents a video of a guy naked on the internet?
[403:50.74]What's your context there?
[403:53.08]Hey, mom and dad, look.
[403:54.74]Hey, I got this naked guy.
[403:56.39]Okay.
[403:58.37]Yeah.
[403:59.19]Why don't you like it?
[404:00.41]I don't know.
[404:00.77]What do you want me to do?
[404:06.07]It's funny.
[404:09.15]I mean, I thought it was fun.
[404:13.32]But a happy birthday, uh, Sedet.
[404:14.82]Thanks for the 10 bucks space butterfly.
[404:16.28]Appreciate it.
[404:17.58]Somnus, thanks for the five dollars.
[404:19.80]Jerma, since all of the furry conventions in the world are getting cancelled, I'm gonna host a virtual furry convention in your chat.
[404:26.05]At least 5,000 furries are going to attend.
[404:28.09]It's happening tomorrow.
[404:28.93]It'd be really weird if you were not lying.
[404:39.35]Anything else, show official?
[404:40.33]Five more dollars, thank you.
[404:43.35]I posted the image to the Discord, you goof.
[404:45.21]Check the art section.
[404:46.77]Well, I clicked it and it took me to a login page for Discord on my web browsing universal remote.
[404:59.94]Guys, I saw him though.
[405:03.87]Furries are already here.
[405:04.95]Oh, wait a minute.
[405:05.45]It's 11 o'clock Pacific.
[405:07.03]11, 12, 1, 2.
[405:08.25]It's 2 a.m.
[405:09.19]Eastern.
[405:09.91]The furries must be here.
[405:11.08]It's the furry time.
[405:13.02]It's Wednesday furry meetup.
[405:16.52]Uh-oh.
[405:20.36]They're already here.
[405:23.83]Who cares?
[405:24.39]Guys, the only way you would know if somebody was a furry in the chat...
[405:32.07]As if they told you.
[405:34.01]It's just people's names.
[405:35.37]They're just chatting.
[405:44.91]Don't worry, they will.
[405:45.85]They always do.
[405:47.49]No, they don't?
[405:48.74]What do you mean?
[405:54.24]They will.
[405:57.90]Kermit's got a fursuit.
[406:01.03]I did, technically.
[406:01.79]It was a frog, right?
[406:02.65]For Christmas.
[406:05.37]Hey, Frito Man, thanks for the thousand bits.
[406:09.34]What the hell is this?
[406:12.96]Shrewd Simon, short-sewed shoes.
[406:16.52]17th summer, speeding storm, spreading sunshine successfully.
[406:21.43]Simon's small, shabby shop still... What the fuck is this?
[406:24.43]Why am I reading this?
[406:27.71]Simon's squeaking sign still swinging, silently specifying Simon Shortsmith Shoemaker.
[406:33.36]Thanks for the $10.
[406:35.13]It's a tongue twister.
[406:39.68]Oh, is it?
[406:40.26]I get this.
[406:41.67]I'll do it.
[406:42.13]Double cursed, whatever.
[407:04.49]Hey, Stripes Beast.
[407:05.25]Thanks for 250 Germa.
[407:06.29]Ever since the Blackjack stream, I've had this idea where you have a casino-based stream where you play No Limit Pocket with chat bits.
[407:13.46]No Limit Poker.
[407:15.28]And vomit every time you hit it big.
[407:17.04]Also, just found out about Benny Harvey today.
[407:21.11]Gonna miss the big guy.
[407:22.03]What happened with me?
[407:42.67]Benny Harvey, wait.
[408:02.50]Trying to see if I know who this is.
[408:05.06]Have I ever watched anything or seen anything?
[408:22.98]Wait, it's not a real joke?
[408:25.35]It's not real, is it?
[408:27.47]No, I'm trying- wait.
[408:29.47]Oh, it's a bit.
[408:30.45]Wait.
[408:31.99]Oh, I thought- I was trying to see if I knew who that was.
[408:34.79]I was like, wait, do I know who this person is?
[408:39.10]You got baited.
[408:40.26]Oh.
[408:42.20]It's a Scottish joke.
[408:43.42]Oh.
[408:44.32]I'm just like trying to figure out- wait, do I know who this person- have I seen any of the things before?
[408:48.56]Oh.
[408:50.30]Oh.
[408:52.69]Well, uh, I ripped R.I.P.
[408:56.24]Is that real?

[409:07.37]German, my water heater is broken and I had to take a bath from five pots of boiling water mixed with cold tap water.
[409:13.53]You play Kingdom Hearts on stream.
[409:16.47]I'm sorry to hear that.
[409:18.62]That sounds terrible.
[409:19.86]And no.
[409:23.89]Five pots of boiling water.
[409:25.41]You gotta be careful with that shit.
[409:29.57]I imagine you holding that pot of boiling water with the steam coming out of it and just like, oh shit!
[409:34.86]Easy, easy, slowly, slowly pour it in.
[409:37.58]You're gonna burn your hands, be careful.
[409:44.78]But thanks to the $5, I will not be playing Kingdom Hearts.
[409:47.90]Those games are too long.
[409:50.10]And I've already beaten them, played through the first two.
[409:52.36]And I have no interest in playing the third one.
[409:55.50]At all.
[409:56.26]Unfortunately.
[409:57.46]Thanks for the $5.
[409:57.86]Hey, MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $3.

[411:26.45]The day that No More Heroes 3 comes out, I will be the first person streaming it on Twitch.
[411:33.32]That's a lie, because that means I have to stream at like 12 o'clock in the night.
[411:36.02]I'm not going to do that.
[411:37.36]The next day, I'll be the first person to stream it on Twitch at 4 o'clock Pacific.
