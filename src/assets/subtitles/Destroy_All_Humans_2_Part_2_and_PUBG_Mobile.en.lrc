[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.46]Hey, what's up?
[00:06.41]Uh, like, a lot of streams.
[00:08.47]I'm gonna open this up and I'm gonna talk a bunch of shit about a company.
[00:11.61]Ready for this one?
[00:12.69]Alright, so, here's the thing.
[00:15.91]Wait, hold on.
[00:16.35]I just pressed the button.
[00:17.21]Let's wait until people get here before I lose my mind about something.
[00:21.51]Like, I fucking can't even... I can't even comprehend this, okay?
[00:25.15]This takes, like, an extra level of comprehension.
[00:28.55]So, just wait.
[00:29.23]I'll be right back.
[00:30.01]We're gonna comprehend this together, okay?
[01:33.39]Okay.
[01:35.19]So.
[01:36.93]Why isn't the sun in the center?
[01:37.99]Because the sun is not the center of the universe.
[01:44.35]I need to calm down for a second, because I'm about to fucking lash into something.
[01:51.72]Okay.
[01:52.96]So, I have this product, right?
[01:55.60]It's called Tile.
[01:57.58]And it's sole purpose...
[01:59.96]is to find your phone you hook it up you attach it to a keychain you double tap the button and no matter where your phone is doesn't matter as long as it's within like a bluetooth range it'll pick it up right a tile it's a really great product really it works here's the one problem so um these things are little squares that you're not allowed to replace the battery on them
[02:24.48]So what you have to do is, after like six to eight months, they stop working.
[02:29.76]And you have to actually, you have to replace it.
[02:33.14]I can't just go down to CVS and get a fucking watch battery and put it in.
[02:37.35]I gotta pay fucking like $25 for them to replace it.
[02:41.70]First of all, like, what the fuck is that bullshit, right?
[02:45.03]Like, I can't just, like, open it up and put a watch battery in there.
[02:47.19]That's what's in there.
[02:48.51]That's what's in there.
[02:48.99]There's a watch battery in there.
[02:50.05]What else could possibly be in there, right?
[02:52.96]So I'm sitting there walking around my house, beeping the tile, and it's out of juice now.
[02:58.36]So my phone is inside of my house.
[03:00.94]It does this little ding.
[03:02.76]It's like, oh, your phone is in the house somewhere.
[03:06.00]I don't know where it is.
[03:07.29]I've looked everywhere.
[03:08.13]I can't find it.
[03:09.11]And it should be pinging my phone and making a bunch of noise.
[03:13.83]It's inside the fucking house.
[03:15.51]I can't, I don't know where.
[03:19.77]Call it?
[03:21.03]I did!
[03:21.81]I cannot hear it.
[03:22.67]I don't know where it is.
[03:23.27]It's like buried under like a fucking bunch of... There's no junk.
[03:26.94]This whole house is being cleaned out.
[03:29.56]The phone is just... It's pretending to be in the house.
[03:33.14]The ringer is not loud enough for me to hear it.
[03:35.04]That's impossible because my ringer is really loud.
[03:41.68]My point is...
[03:43.06]Is that the tile is telling me, hey, your phone is around here somewhere, but I'm not going to ping it.
[03:48.34]Because I don't have enough battery for that.
[03:49.84]You need to give me 25 more dollars for that.
[03:54.22]These things are like a fucking hundred bucks for like a four pack.
[03:57.43]Get the fuck out of here.
[03:58.39]You know what I mean?
[03:58.87]Tell me I can't replace my own battery in my own device that I purchased.
[04:08.96]I'm sitting there, walking around, looking at my whole house from my phone.
[04:12.68]That is absolutely in the house.
[04:16.74]I checked it.
[04:17.12]For the last 50 minutes, I've been tearing apart this already torn apart house.
[04:26.42]Why can't it take new batteries?
[04:27.60]Because otherwise, the company can't guaranteed siphon money from you forever.
[04:33.72]No, no, you can't replace your own battery.
[04:36.00]No, that's too hard for you.
[04:38.11]You see, you have to give it, you have to send it back to us so we can verify that it ran out of battery and then you buy a new one from us.
[04:46.51]Isn't that sound like not a fucking scam at all?
[04:49.37]That's just not me describing a scam.
[04:52.18]This is me.
[04:52.72]It's a tile, man.
[04:53.70]Get a tile.
[05:08.71]Alright, anyways, hey, I still don't know where my phone is.
[05:13.55]And I walked outside and I pressed the button and it's like, nope, no, it's not out here.
[05:19.05]I'm about to sludge hammer my walls until I find it.
[05:27.69]Why would I buy something like that?
[05:28.87]Because, I don't know, I got suck at it because I lose my keys and phone and shit all the time.
[05:37.82]Is it in your pocket?
[05:39.47]Oh, there it is!
[05:41.23]It's right into my pocket!
[05:43.87]No.
[05:46.37]I've been in full-on meltdown mode for the last, like, fucking hour.
[05:52.62]Like, you know when you just sit there and you just swelter, and you repeat the problem over and over again?
[05:59.56]I was sitting on my couch, just saying out loud, I was going like this.
[06:05.36]Here, I'll give you like a perfect, here's like a rendition of what happened here.
[06:09.04]I was going like this.
[06:12.04]This is not big enough.
[06:13.10]Here we go.
[06:15.18]Here.
[06:18.18]Here's a little fucking weird today, but this is exactly what I was doing.
[06:22.88]I was sitting there like this, and I kept on going over and over again, going, this is impossible.
[06:30.29]The phone is in the house.
[06:32.81]This is not possible.
[06:35.05]The phone is in the house.
[06:37.47]It's not possible.
[06:39.85]Literally, I sound like a fucking villain, like a movie villain.
[06:45.51]I see it.
[06:47.37]Oh, do you?
[06:50.55]It's on top of your head.
[06:54.02]Now imagine if I just did this elaborate thing.
[06:56.44]Did I check the car?
[06:58.74]Yeah, it's not on the car because remember the tile...
[07:01.33]It still has enough battery to tell me where the phone, like, that I'm in.
[07:04.38]I'm, like, playing scavenger hunt.
[07:06.24]It's just hot and cold.
[07:07.84]I can press the button on the tile and it's like, nah, dude, you're too cold.
[07:10.54]You're a little cold here.
[07:12.42]I have to actually navigate and walk around the house with this, holding, like, a fucking lantern in my hand.
[07:17.45]It's in the toilet.
[07:20.45]I checked.
[07:20.79]Anyways, hey, welcome to the next stream, guys.
[07:28.92]Accidentally put in fridge.
[07:29.94]No, I checked the fridge.
[07:32.60]I checked everywhere.
[07:33.76]I don't know.
[07:34.36]I don't know where it is.
[07:35.28]It's driving me insane.
[07:39.77]Press the tile button right now.
[07:41.85]It's upstairs.
[07:42.37]I threw it into the ground.
[07:43.59]I can't find it.
[07:46.51]You want to hear what the tile sounds like when it's looking for a phone?
[07:51.07]I literally spiked it into the ground.
[07:52.69]But remember, it doesn't matter.
[07:54.52]Send it back to us and give us 20 bucks and replace it.
[07:57.90]In fact, you know, I want to look up right now because this has got me all kinds of tipped off here.
[08:03.14]How much is a watch battery?
[08:07.19]Because that's what's in there.
[08:12.97]How much does a watch battery take to replace?
[08:22.68]It's 10 bucks.
[08:24.92]Three for $6.00.
[08:31.26]How come there's no plug?
[08:32.34]Why can't I plug it in with like a little Jack and charge it if that's the case?
[08:36.32]10 times markup.
[08:45.79]What does this say?
[08:46.29]Do you remember Ghost Psycho?
[08:48.89]This is impossible.
[08:53.40]I gotta get my mind off this.
[08:54.96]But then I keep thinking about like, who has my phone?
[08:57.24]Where's my phone?
[08:57.90]It's like losing a baby.
[09:01.63]It's losing a child.
[09:03.29]I am just beside myself right now.
[09:04.95]I don't know where he is.
[09:07.05]Where is my son?
[09:11.19]If I don't have complete tabs on him, it's like losing a baby, man.
[09:22.64]I can't enjoy playing a video game while my son is lost and I just found out about it.
[09:29.53]Like, imagine if this was a kid?
[09:32.64]Uh, yeah, so we just want to report that, uh, Johnny Elbertson is currently missing.
[09:37.10]By the way, he's six, and I'm just like, oh, fuck!
[09:40.80]Albion sure does look interesting.
[09:43.09]My fucking son is gone!
[09:51.89]Is this the streamer with a phone the size of a lost child?
[09:56.80]Retrace your footsteps?
[09:57.96]It's hard to retrace your footsteps when I can't even retrace back like... 30 seconds ago!
[10:04.21]I forgot, I... I don't even remember, I don't remember pressing start in the game.
[10:09.73]I have no idea how I got here.
[10:14.41]Let's electrocute this lady!
[10:16.97]Okay, now that we're done with that... Let's talk to, uh, let's talk to this dude.
[10:26.07]Like, God damn it.
[10:27.44]I need that.
[10:27.82]Like, my kid needs to be right in front of me here.
[10:30.06]Fucking tile.
[10:31.38]Buy a shitload of them.
[10:32.76]Spend like 300 bucks.
[10:43.54]Tweet out the stream.
[10:46.82]I can't.
[10:48.32]I can't tweet out the stream.
[10:50.11]Because I only know- I'm only logged in on my iPhone.
[10:52.91]I don't even know my Twitter password.
[10:54.63]I have no idea what it is.
[10:56.91]I'm just permanently logged in on my phone.
[11:00.45]So not only is my son gone, but he also has the keys to my house.
[11:05.80]So I'm fucked.
[11:07.68]I lost my son.
[11:09.24]He's got all the keys!
[11:11.63]He's taking Disney World somewhere.
[11:13.23]How am I gonna get in and out of my house?
[11:15.05]Use find my iPhone?
[11:17.86]No, because I'm paranoid and I never signed up for iCloud.
[11:36.62]Secret base underground.
[11:38.76]Well, that shouldn't be too tough.
[11:40.26]Did you scan the city while we were flying in?
[11:44.19]Yes, but it's useless.
[11:46.03]The city's riddled with tunnels, pipes, and excavations galore.
[11:50.29]It's like a dump mine.
[11:53.08]Now Kim was already trying to call.
[11:55.06]It's just nowhere.
[11:56.36]And then you start to get angry.
[11:58.69]At like the sound of your fridge.
[12:02.35]Like the things that would never piss you off.
[12:04.37]I've never thought to be angry at my fridge's humming sound.
[12:08.57]Until you need total silence.
[12:10.35]You know what I'm saying?
[12:14.53]Like I'm sitting there trying to listen to my faint ringtone.
[12:17.96]And all I hear is like the air conditioner.
[12:19.86]And I'm like rip that fucking thing out of the wall.
[12:23.17]Like, I hear my fridge, like... It's like, shut the fuck up!
[12:26.78]I'm trying to hear my iPhone!
[12:30.78]You end up unplugging every device, and you sit there in, like, a dark room.
[12:33.76]It's silent, like, looking for it.
[12:38.01]Okay.
[12:38.93]Locate the tunnels, infiltrate them, and find Agent Orangeov.
[12:43.65]Then squeeze.
[12:45.33]Hard.
[12:47.75]Don't bully the fridge.
[12:48.71]He's finally snapped.
[12:50.81]No, this is... I'm telling you.
[12:52.25]An hour before the stream started, I was... I've been looking for it.
[12:55.17]It's in my house.
[12:56.11]I don't know what animal took it and, like, is hiding it.
[12:58.19]Alright, find Agent Ornachov on the underground base.
[13:05.84]I'm telling you right now, Kim's gonna walk in here.
[13:07.34]And she's gonna be like, here it is.
[13:09.66]And I'm just gonna be like, oh!
[13:11.56]You found my baby!
[13:13.14]Alright, let's take this guy.
[13:20.98]Alright, so we're in London?
[13:22.54]Is that where we are?
[13:24.82]So I need to go... I need to find the... Find it in the underground base.
[13:31.66]Find Agent Ornitrov's underground base.
[13:34.35]I'm going to say it's probably by the Soviet Embassy.
[13:38.19]Start scanning people and find out where it is.
[13:44.89]Do you know anything about Orange Man's base?
[13:48.35]Thanks for the info.
[13:49.39]No, Hyde Park Tunnel.
[13:50.11]We just need to go over to Hyde Park.
[13:53.08]So we're gonna bang a right.
[13:55.24]Phone's in the bed.
[13:55.70]No, it's not in the bed.
[14:18.44]Where were you when you told the Twitch Twitter to DM you?
[14:20.80]I was at a restaurant, but it's not there either.
[14:31.32]It's in Vegas.
[14:32.08]It's not in my pocket.
[14:33.46]That would be a funny moment right there, wouldn't it?
[14:38.42]How do I know?
[14:38.86]I remember using the phone in the house when I got back from the restaurant.
[14:45.68]Yeah, I lost my phone.
[14:46.60]It's gone.
[14:49.38]The tunnel here.
[14:50.18]It's a tunnel apparently.
[14:51.20]There it is.
[14:54.92]Okay.
[14:55.88]Let's do free love and let's take one of these secret agents.
[14:58.57]They have like machine guns.
[15:00.23]Why is he... Did he die?
[15:18.67]Okay, we're good.
[15:21.73]There's the excavation site.
[15:24.17]What's your number?
[15:24.88]I'll call it.
[15:37.78]This would be it.
[15:41.10]Let's just be on the corner.
[15:43.34]I would be very surprised because I lost my mind looking for it.
[15:47.32]Search the tunnels for the agent.
[15:49.84]Maybe you'll know where it is.
[15:53.38]There we go.
[15:54.06]Possible intruder?
[15:56.76]What's your Mastercard number?
[15:58.52]I'll call you.
[16:17.90]I don't know why I just did this.
[16:19.06]Why did I replace this guy?
[16:23.00]That was not even... I could have just walked up and touched this.
[16:32.06]This guy's not going to be... This is like Hitman, right?
[16:33.94]I'm one of them.
[16:37.72]Check inside your hand.
[16:40.69]Use the Google service?
[16:42.05]I've spotted a weapon datacore near your position.
[16:45.07]I'll slap it up
[16:47.21]I'm afraid of putting... It's in the house.
[16:49.74]My rant was about how after like six months, I had to replace... One of them died, by the way.
[16:55.44]So here's the thing.
[16:56.58]I'm going to talk about tile again.
[16:59.08]So they came in a pack.
[17:02.70]And half of them barely worked out of the pack.
[17:05.60]Like one of them died completely in two months.
[17:08.02]And the other three have lasted about like seven months.
[17:11.24]Guaranteed for a year, by the way.
[17:14.10]Here's the anal probe.
[17:22.56]What was I doing with it when I came home?
[17:26.38]Looking up pictures of bugs.
[17:29.90]Swear to God.
[17:34.39]I was looking up camel spiders and black widows because I was like, oh, what are the bugs in Las Vegas?
[17:43.66]Yeah, so you have to aim it at their butt and press R1.
[17:54.97]Oh, well, I guess, okay, that... Is he dead from that?
[17:59.97]Is this just filling this whole place?
[18:01.65]Uh-oh.
[18:04.06]Oh, what do we got?
[18:07.22]We got zap-o-matic disintegrator ray, anal probe.
[18:09.42]Let's just try it.
[18:10.92]Might as well, right?
[18:11.62]Does it make their head explode?
[18:22.09]It does, okay.
[18:23.41]There are brains in this one.
[18:31.37]Snatch him up.
[18:36.70]Clean snatch!
[18:37.56]And the brain is gone.
[18:38.50]It wasn't fast enough.
[18:43.80]Hello.
[18:44.58]Goodbye.
[18:47.28]We're in London right now?
[18:48.12]Is that where we are?
[18:53.04]What the f- Why did that happen?
[18:54.94]Oh, because the game needed to do a cutscene, so it had to pull me out.
[19:05.45]Freeze!
[19:08.43]How does this game compare to the first?
[19:14.22]This one is way better.
[19:15.02]This one opened.
[19:15.64]Feels like there's more going on in the streets.
[19:17.14]I hear movement upstairs.
[19:32.20]I hear movement as in, like, I'm moving around quickly because I'm about to come down and tell you I found the phone.
[19:41.37]I heard, like, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[19:42.77]Like, here it is.
[19:43.21]I got your phone.
[19:43.75]Did I just kill him?
[19:51.79]So that's it?
[19:59.07]Oh, no, it's...
[20:01.10]Is that supposed to be him?
[20:02.06]So he's like a... alien agent.
[20:07.86]Here's the boss.
[20:08.76]Eliminate.
[20:09.50]Orange.
[20:10.96]Uh, we're gonna do the disintegrator ray.
[20:31.93]Well, you just came out of nowhere.
[20:35.42]I'd probably have to walk him into this stuff if I was to take a guess.
[20:41.04]Try using your anal probe to disinfect him.
[20:44.40]Okay.
[20:49.20]Has he been disinfected?
[20:50.14]Oh, there you go.
[20:52.28]Okay.
[20:52.54]Now I can probably hurt him with this.
[20:58.12]Yeah, I get it.
[21:00.42]He can now be injured.
[21:02.80]Did you find it?
[21:03.42]Did you find it?
[21:04.66]No, I just want you to sign into that so I can ping it.
[21:10.69]Oh, this is find my iPhone?
[21:12.75]Yeah.
[21:13.23]Yeah, I never signed up for iCloud because I was paranoid of iCloud, so you can't use this.
[21:17.91]Wait, I can't?
[21:18.83]No.
[21:21.97]I'm like going crazy looking for it, though.
[21:26.95]Wait, so you really didn't, you really didn't do this?
[21:28.61]No, I never signed up because I didn't want anyone to see my naked pictures on my iPhone.
[21:32.45]So, like, I didn't want to, like, sign up because we heard about all the people that got their naked pictures stolen.
[21:37.21]Yeah, but no one cares about you, though.
[21:40.68]Alright, good luck finding it.
[21:49.36]I don't want to find my naked iPhone pictures.
[22:02.54]I don't have any iPhone- Look, I have- I told you this, I have like four pictures on my iPhone, three of them on my dog.
[22:07.24]Oh, he's dead.
[22:15.28]No, wait, why are you still alive?
[22:16.60]I don't have any more ammo in this.
[22:23.11]Did I actually just lose?
[22:29.48]Alright, apparently I'm dead.
[22:31.34]So... He has to die.
[22:33.82]Alright, you don't have to shoot him once for the disinfection.
[22:39.91]That's fine.
[22:46.26]Don't change.
[22:46.84]Don't change.
[22:47.40]Good.
[22:47.94]That was dumb.
[22:54.53]It's probably like under a towel.
[22:58.24]That's so fucking stupid.
[23:00.38]That's so aggravating.
[23:04.34]It's so aggravating that I have a device specifically to find the phone.
[23:07.88]And it drains battery in six months.
[23:10.42]And then you have to pay them more money to send you a new one.
[23:12.59]That's bullshit.
[23:16.69]Forgive me, it seemed best simply to stand clear and give you room to do what you do so well.
[23:20.79]Conserviats are rather slippery fish.
[23:24.37]Yes, very slippery indeed, but they do crack.
[23:28.50]If you'll follow me, Mr. President, I can promise you answers in abundance, shall we?
[23:32.78]Alright, let's follow Mr. Englishman.
[23:39.32]Is he helping me fight?
[23:46.65]Jacket pocket?
[23:47.27]No.
[23:47.60]I mean, I'm not wearing it.
[23:48.28]It's like 80 degrees outside.
[23:49.76]I'm not wearing a jacket.
[23:54.06]I'm going to follow him this way.
[24:02.14]Kill him?
[24:02.38]He's a human?
[24:02.80]Yeah, but he's helping me.
[24:04.92]Oh, well, I almost ditched.
[24:05.73]He's killing me.
[24:10.18]I can't kill him, right?
[24:12.32]Okay, stop.
[24:13.18]What are you doing?
[24:14.38]He's just like trying to get me to shoot him.
[24:16.21]Let's get the zapper out.
[24:31.46]Come here, come here, come here.
[24:33.08]Good.
[24:38.53]Have you checked your subs?
[24:39.53]Maybe one of these bastards took it.
[24:44.25]I don't think any of you guys would take it.
[24:47.47]I really don't think you guys would take it.
[24:48.53]I think if you found it, you would hand it in to the lost and found.
[24:54.47]After taking all my naked pictures off of it.
[24:58.81]I think he's shooting me in the back.
[25:01.05]Yes, he is.
[25:02.08]Thanks a lot, dude.
[25:03.16]Great work.
[25:11.63]in the garbage I would never be there though there's no way that's why I just keep having this conversation how like this it's just impossible we're like we're describing something that's just impossible did I put it in a box
[25:39.46]No, no way.
[25:40.92]What box did I put him in?
[25:42.86]Don't shoot me.
[25:49.45]Look at this guy's gun.
[25:55.57]I haven't even realized what's going on right now.
[25:58.30]Just wait a second.
[26:01.16]He's shooting it like a pistol.
[26:06.18]No, it's an umbrella!
[26:07.58]Okay.
[26:08.48]Now don't die here.
[26:09.46]I need to see this better.
[26:22.68]It really is just a rapid-fire pistol, but it's a recoil that makes no sense.
[26:28.97]And he's missing every shot.
[26:30.55]He didn't hit that guy with one bullet and he died.
[26:34.35]Take a look, take a look, ready?
[26:35.61]Not one connection with the bullet.
[26:42.34]In fact, he's shooting at me.
[26:46.74]Oh, he got him with one.
[26:47.64]Alright, I've had more, uh... I've had more accurate games of laser tag.
[27:05.02]Almost out.
[27:05.42]Yeah, it's an umbrella.
[27:08.64]It's not even a gun.
[27:10.12]Where does the ammo go?
[27:16.00]Behind the computer.
[27:18.34]If it's behind my computer, I will seriously... Hold on.
[27:23.79]It's not behind the computer.
[27:31.45]No.
[27:31.51]It's not here.
[27:51.29]You were right.
[27:57.63]I never had a phone to begin with.
[27:58.79]That would have been really odd.
[28:00.30]And I lost him.
[28:01.68]Where'd he go?
[28:02.00]Did he just go out here?
[28:06.64]I'm looking, I swear.
[28:07.70]Where are you?
[28:08.18]Have you looked under your phone?
[28:09.22]Yeah, dude, I should have looked under my phone.
[28:12.83]What am I following?
[28:40.64]What?
[28:46.37]Am I getting dragged around here?
[28:47.93]What am I looking for?
[28:48.93]What's going on?
[28:49.59]What is this?
[28:50.95]Oh, he's underground.
[28:55.64]Come on, you can do it.
[28:57.02]There he is.
[29:03.28]I wonder if we might have a little chat now, Mr. President.
[29:06.33]yeah sure what the hey wait a second Mr. president I ain't in my presence they don't call it british intelligence for nothing old boy okay you got my attention who the hell are you bizarre reginald ponsonby smythe at your service and her majesty's
[29:33.95]It's gonna be, like, in a bag of food or something.
[29:37.36]Like, I swear to God, it's gonna be in a bag of potato chips.
[29:41.57]Or, like, in the trash.
[29:43.34]OK, so I'm starting to get a little ticked off here.
[29:47.57]These bastards blow up my mothership, kill my boss, screw up my pension plan.
[29:54.45]And just when I track one of them down, he turns into some kind of super powered freakazoid mozzarella monster.
[30:03.59]I sympathize.
[30:04.39]To be Frank, sir, we appear to be fighting a common enemy.
[30:07.27]Might it not be the better part of valor to join forces and pool our information?
[30:12.13]Check the roof.
[30:15.32]You know, that would make sense.
[30:17.39]Because it's in the house.
[30:20.13]But that wouldn't make any sense.
[30:22.05]Why would I throw my phone in the world?
[30:23.59]Bonus search?
[30:24.11]You know, I'm actually just thinking.
[30:25.63]Hey, I got a funny stream idea.
[30:27.25]I'll do like an IRL where we look for my phone.
[30:29.46]I need my phone to do that.
[30:33.08]So that's out the window.
[30:45.71]Whoever this Ponsonby is, he seems awfully convenient.
[30:51.41]Contrived, even.
[30:55.71]Keep an eye on him, Crypto.
[30:57.55]I got two missions.
[30:58.63]Three missions, actually.
[30:59.70]They opened up.
[31:03.00]Now let everybody dance.
[31:06.38]Let's get inside of this guy.
[31:07.62]Uh-huh.
[31:10.70]Hello.
[31:13.16]Let's go to the next mission.
[31:16.38]Carry your PC around I would need a huge backpack Should I steal steal Kim's phone and like hide Kim's phone So then she doesn't know where it is and I can like feel we can be on the same level That would be so stupid
[31:51.16]It's the evil plan.
[31:52.34]Start an IRL stream from the phone, and then the phone will be in my hand.
[31:57.62]No, it'll be pointing in a direction.
[32:11.72]No, no, the Serbian ambassador is throwing a party for the opening of an exhibit of Russian modern art.
[32:17.86]Frankly, it's making me a bit nervous.
[32:20.08]A number of Albion's VIPs are in attendance.
[32:22.42]It's like in the shower.
[32:25.26]So, what?
[32:26.60]You want me to get over there, rough the ambassador up a little?
[32:31.27]Dear Lord, no.
[32:33.01]I just need you to mingle with the crowd and check it out.
[32:35.87]Incognito, as it were.
[32:37.97]Okay, I'll get a disguise.
[32:40.45]Wouldn't want my pretty mug to ruin anybody's appetite.
[32:43.41]Alright, let's do it.
[32:46.80]Okie dokie, Smokey.
[32:48.26]Get a disguise and mingle with the crowd.
[32:49.68]I'll go grab a disguise and mingle with the in crowd.
[32:52.86]Did you just write, did you just write, I bet Ninja never loses his phone?
[32:58.74]What, what, what does like twitch.tv popularity have to do with losing something?
[33:08.93]I don't even know how to respond to that.
[33:13.62]Disguise!
[33:15.74]Stop fucking dancing.
[33:21.04]I can't focus on the game until I get the phone.
[33:23.72]You can see right through me, guys.
[33:27.94]If I play Fortnite, I won't lose my phone.
[33:29.98]I'll lose way more than my phone if I start playing Fortnite.
[33:41.23]What was that?
[33:55.28]Was I supposed to do this?
[34:00.25]Oh yeah, they're all turning into these aliens.
[34:03.15]The people I need to disinfect.
[34:10.05]There she is.
[34:10.53]What does Lestrovia mean?
[34:11.53]Like, let's get it!
[34:12.97]Oh, Heaven's an alien!
[34:13.59]Like, you think?
[34:41.39]We need to get out of here.
[34:47.82]You're making this worse.
[34:49.94]I need to... I seriously don't have anything.
[34:54.46]I need to re-up my ammo here.
[34:56.42]What is that?
[35:00.49]I need to remove these people.
[35:04.71]From the mortal world.
[35:09.02]Why do the UK police have guns?
[35:11.78]Easier to program that.
[35:13.00]Thanks, Cupcake.
[35:21.48]Always nice to meet a chick who can handle her guns.
[35:27.98]The name is Natalia.
[35:29.22]I'm here to help you, Spaceman.
[35:31.76]Or do you prefer Mr. President?
[35:33.64]Look at this.
[35:34.18]I keep going like this.
[35:35.56]What the?
[35:36.42]After every mission.
[35:37.06]Does everybody on this dismal freaking island know who I am?
[35:40.57]I'm not going to fight.
[35:42.29]It's not in here.
[35:43.51]At least everyone in my line of work.
[35:50.15]It's not under the TV.
[35:53.20]yet although after this little incident I may have to ask him for a job I worked for the comatose it's not over there you made pasta I'm a secret agent with the kgb hmm what the hell do you think was in those statues
[36:15.50]Hard to say.
[36:16.66]It's listed in official documents as .
[36:20.28]Sounds taste.
[36:21.14]I'm so uncomfortable in my chair.
[36:23.56]I keep thinking about somebody having it and using it.
[36:27.60]Or a quasi-legal performance enhancer for the Soviet Olympic team, depending on the context.
[36:35.45]Check the pocket of yesterday's pants.
[36:40.26]That's the thing.
[36:40.96]I had it like an hour and a half ago.
[37:02.96]It's in the house.
[37:03.74]You think somebody engineered it for the purpose?
[37:08.00]You have a better explanation?
[37:09.94]I'm just trying to put all the pieces together.
[37:12.00]Check today's pants.
[37:12.92]I'm currently wearing them.
[37:22.69]Check yesterday's pants.
[37:26.51]Check tomorrow's pants.
[37:28.59]They might be in tomorrow's pants.
[37:31.98]The schedule's been moved up.
[37:33.70]They're about to shower these abominable spores all over the city.
[37:37.04]Check the washing machine.
[37:38.16]Hold on a minute.
[37:39.64]Wait a minute.
[37:40.78]Distinct memory.
[37:41.46]Wait a minute.
[37:41.83]Thank you.
[37:42.93]I'll be right back.
[37:46.03]It's on the washing machine, I think.
[37:49.25]She's right.
[37:49.89]You must hurry to Hyde Park and kill all infected humans at once.
[37:53.23]We mustn't allow this parasite to spread.
[37:56.95]My men have marked locations for four similar statues in Hyde Park.
[38:00.47]These should be your first port of call.
[39:05.05]Thank you.
[39:37.29]Okay.
[40:08.02]And there it is.
[40:29.47]Ladies and gentlemen, iPhone is
[40:35.64]Bingo!
[40:36.12]I don't have it.
[40:37.94]It's not here.
[40:38.98]It's not there.
[40:39.60]I freaked.
[40:40.12]It's not there.
[40:40.52]I don't know where it is.
[40:46.87]Wait, did I pause it?
[40:47.53]I don't think I paused this yet.
[40:59.19]I need to get ammo.
[41:04.93]I need to get ammo, seriously.
[41:10.61]I can't pick these guys up.
[41:14.31]I'm doing, like, disintegrate stuff.
[41:17.98]Ban that guy?
[41:19.26]No, he was just trying to help!
[41:20.46]What do you mean, ban that guy?
[41:24.68]Yeah, that was a good idea.
[41:29.16]That was a good idea.
[41:35.68]I'm not going to ban him.
[41:37.96]Why would I do that?
[41:38.92]Alright, let me disintegrate this.
[41:44.92]Nope, never mind.
[41:47.28]Nope, never mind.
[41:52.27]How come I not... Can I not?
[41:57.17]Well, we have to smash all these things.
[42:00.85]I need the anal probe, man.
[42:07.87]Where'd they go?
[42:11.53]Where'd they go?
[42:11.99]Here goes a Spore!
[42:12.63]I gotta get it!
[42:13.01]Oh well.
[42:14.55]Ban that guy.
[42:28.74]I really need ammo.
[42:30.20]And like, for some reason I can't suck up the cars.
[42:33.92]Uh, what am I... I need... Yeah, I only have five bullets with the ammo throw.
[42:40.59]This is taking too long.
[42:49.40]We're gonna die here.
[42:53.68]Wait, Etalyx is the one that said it?
[42:58.94]Was he?
[43:00.48]Should've known.
[43:00.98]Recycle the trash.
[43:06.19]There we go.
[43:09.35]Give me ammo, please.
[43:12.85]That's what I want.
[43:13.81]Again!
[43:22.51]Really is like the worst thing ever, man.
[43:25.83]Fucking phones and devices and... Done?
[43:35.29]Done.
[43:45.29]Yeah, as I've said a thousand times before, fuck technology.
[43:50.12]It's like, what a disaster, right?
[43:52.28]It's been nothing but done bad things.
[43:54.65]Let me go back to the fucking newspaper.
[44:08.66]My job is technology?
[44:12.10]My job is not technology.
[44:17.08]It's alright.
[44:17.54]I would be alright.
[44:18.54]I'd be okay if I couldn't do streaming anymore.
[44:21.86]And it meant that some of us would be reading newspapers again.
[44:26.13]I wouldn't want it.
[44:27.79]No.
[44:28.25]Bring me back the technology.
[44:29.41]Newspaper sucks anyways.
[44:39.51]I was kidding.
[44:41.17]I'm trying to lighten the situation where I have a missing phone.
[44:46.96]Uh, what does this want me to do?
[44:49.60]That's the cave drawings.
[44:50.44]Oh, he wants me just to kill people.
[44:52.90]Kill.
[44:53.10]Kill.
[44:53.24]Kill.
[45:15.55]Any others around here that you'd want me to kill?
[45:17.33]Do we need to make a mystery stream?
[45:23.66]List off the places I've checked so far?
[45:25.54]Hold on, let me just refresh the spawn rate of these people.
[45:38.45]He's probably on a bookshelf.
[45:41.29]He's not one to do that though.
[45:42.51]Thank you!
[45:43.21]Last one over here.
[45:44.61]Give me that.
[45:46.07]Thank you.
[45:46.39]Cool.
[45:46.49]I need to spend these.
[45:47.59]I have a lot of them.
[46:11.38]Well, these guys already broke out.
[46:12.50]I was too slow.
[46:13.88]Oh, fuck you.
[46:17.34]Seriously.
[46:19.02]Not you guys.
[46:19.68]Like, what just happened?
[46:27.70]Crack in the couch cushions?
[46:30.20]No, we get... Look, let me... Listen.
[46:32.72]We need to get away from this.
[46:34.30]I don't want this just to become a... Where's my iPhone screen?
[46:40.31]You know what I mean?
[46:41.25]We have to move away from this.
[46:42.67]I can't have this be the whole stream.
[46:50.37]It already is.
[46:51.09]No, we can't have it be like this.
[46:52.56]It's been 47 minutes.
[46:54.30]Let's talk about something else.
[46:55.16]What, like, happened today?
[46:56.56]Any news?
[46:58.48]There's got to be some news today, right?
[46:59.90]Uh... Trying to think of some news.
[47:16.02]Let me infect.
[47:16.83]Let me infect, but disinfect is actually what's happening.
[47:25.09]You, you, you, you, you, you.
[47:30.61]You didn't get disinfected from that?
[47:32.37]It only lasts a certain amount of time, huh?
[47:40.23]You gotta go now.
[47:45.29]That's it?
[47:46.25]God damn it, there's more!
[47:50.93]Everybody lost their phone today.
[47:55.19]National lose your phone day.
[47:58.65]There's a new sarcophagus found?
[47:59.91]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[48:03.55]So, there's a new sarcophagus found in King Tut's tomb.
[48:09.22]Or something.
[48:10.72]That sounds kind of cool.
[48:12.92]You know, actually, I did a book report.
[48:16.26]I had to dress up as the person.
[48:18.14]We did a thing when I was like in the fifth grade or something.
[48:21.64]Where you did a book report.
[48:22.56]You had to stop.
[48:23.18]Hold on.
[48:23.66]Stop it.
[48:24.02]Stop it.
[48:24.26]Look at my health.
[48:24.78]Look at my health.
[48:26.28]That's not important right now.
[48:29.90]Oh, God.
[48:34.80]So, I had to dress up as King Tut.
[48:37.18]Because we had to be like the person... Do a book report on... I'm George Washington.
[48:41.63]I'm King Tut.
[48:44.01]And you had to pretend like you were giving the presentation.
[48:46.25]Or something.
[48:46.95]As that person.
[48:47.85]I don't know.
[48:50.33]This is not a lie.
[48:51.01]This is real.
[48:56.98]It was seriously just a book report that just replaced he with I. So instead of like, King Tut was, it was I was.
[49:05.09]That's it.
[49:16.92]Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.
[49:18.30]Alright, do that.
[49:19.24]Yeah, just first person, that was it.
[49:28.10]Was it a book report or a history report?
[49:31.56]Well, it was a book report because we had a book to read based on person.
[49:36.18]So it was a history, but we had a book to read because we talked about, like, fifth grade.
[49:40.96]We probably had, like, a pop-up book based on, like, George Washington.
[49:45.31]Like, nine words in it.
[49:46.41]Ooh, a weapon.
[49:52.10]Weapon?
[49:53.86]What is it?
[49:54.28]Do I have any more anal probes?
[49:56.24]Only two, but it's alright.
[49:57.16]That's all I need, isn't it?
[49:59.37]One.
[50:00.21]Two.
[50:01.43]Need more than that, but it's okay.
[50:03.13]70 out of 150.
[50:03.41]Only you left.
[50:09.56]I think we're just gonna kill you like this.
[50:17.20]Good game.
[50:17.72]Alright.
[50:18.64]Good game!
[50:20.16]I don't think I can get up there.
[50:21.94]Hmm.
[50:22.18]How does he want to get up there?
[50:23.94]I think I need the other boost.
[50:25.00]Yeah.
[50:25.62]Where's the nearest... I'm going to get the nearest... Let's see.
[50:47.13]Ooh, that's close!
[50:48.27]I gotta... What weapon is it?
[50:57.56]Get up there!
[51:00.88]Anti-gravity field, data core retreat.
[51:04.60]The anti-gravity field can disable enemies attacking your saucer.
[51:08.20]Press the R1 to launch an anti-gravity field.
[51:11.96]Ooh, we're gonna do saucer weapon.
[51:13.50]Cool.
[51:14.28]I opened up a little bit.
[51:15.96]Let's um... I need to upgrade though.
[51:19.22]Where is the nearest... Right behind me to the right.
[51:23.29]Let's go upgrade a little.
[51:26.61]Just a little.
[51:36.35]I have your phone.
[51:37.05]I'm sorry I didn't know it was yours.
[51:38.15]Let me know after the stream where I can meet you.
[51:39.71]Totally 100% not a joke.
[51:46.68]I don't want this.
[51:48.06]Is it like outside?
[51:49.30]Is it on the ground or something?
[51:55.29]No.
[51:55.53]This is 100% not a joke.
[52:04.71]Let's get this over with.
[52:06.25]Give me the big one.
[52:07.79]Frost King 5000.
[52:12.26]Dislocator.
[52:15.92]Maximum death ray heat damage.
[52:17.90]That sounds pretty good to me.
[52:20.44]And maximum cooldown.
[52:21.86]I will take them both.
[52:24.25]Six.
[52:26.71]Already got this one.
[52:27.41]Anything else for six?
[52:31.11]Yep.
[52:32.58]Anti-gravity for 15 seconds, or increase anti-gravity field capacity to 5.
[52:37.54]Might as well just get it, get more capacity.
[52:47.66]Trust me.
[52:50.66]If there's something I've learned in life, when somebody says, you can trust me, that usually means, dear God, don't trust this thing I say.
[52:58.81]Now, when somebody tells you, look, don't listen to me, but let me tell you this.
[53:02.47]Usually they're being truthful.
[53:08.69]Let's go get this mission.
[53:13.50]Trust me, I'm a doctor.
[53:14.56]But no, a doctor doesn't... When was the last time you heard a doctor tell you to trust me?
[53:19.88]Hey, I know you came in here.
[53:21.20]Hey, trust me.
[53:22.38]Trust... No.
[53:23.56]They give you an opinion.
[53:25.28]You know, I guess it could be this.
[53:26.90]It might be that.
[53:28.16]I'm not certain of that, but we'll check and see if it's this.
[53:31.85]Why is that all the way out there?
[53:34.39]I've never heard a doctor say, listen, trust me.
[53:40.23]Where is that?
[53:42.83]Um... That's... Okay, weird.
[53:47.37]Uh...
[53:50.93]Yeah, let's go down there.
[53:52.41]I'm gonna take the, uh... I was gonna say train.
[53:59.11]Trust me, I'm a doctor.
[54:00.01]You know, I would listen to it if it was, I'm a doctor, here's what I have to say about that current situation that you're currently having a problem with right now.
[54:09.66]I would trust it.
[54:23.44]Trust me Nine out of ten doctors recommend trusting them really don't Let's get in there Is this so is it awkward
[54:53.64]I'm going to have to.
[54:54.52]I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on this week into this weekend.
[55:02.83]So I'm going to find it.
[55:05.75]I'm going to find the damn thing.
[55:08.45]It's going to pop up somewhere in such a random fucking location.
[55:13.86]And I'm going to be so angry when I find it.
[55:16.04]I'm going to be so upset.
[55:22.24]Because it was in the dog bed or something.
[55:24.11]Or maybe I just never will find it.
[55:31.53]And it's just buried in this house somewhere.
[55:40.19]Check dog bed.
[55:41.39]Check the dog bed.
[55:53.22]No, I can't run upstairs again.
[55:55.40]Alright, this way to the right.
[55:58.58]Let's do the demon door.
[56:03.09]I check the eye, check the car.
[56:07.43]This has been like a full hour of talking about my fucking phone.
[56:12.45]There's something else to talk about.
[56:13.99]There has to be.
[56:20.69]There has to be something else.
[56:24.58]What's in there?
[56:25.06]What's a TV show that's on TV right now that anyone saw?
[56:30.74]TV.
[56:31.12]Give me something to do, will ya?
[56:34.26]Tired of bird watching already, are ya?
[56:37.47]At the moment, our most pressing need is to persuade the young twins to stop taking Revoline.
[56:44.97]Get them high on life, eh?
[56:47.15]Sounds good.
[56:48.29]How do we do it?
[56:50.02]I have been pondering how best to manipulate the adolescent... Seinfeld is not on anymore.
[56:54.71]...culture to our advantage.
[56:58.35]Bart lost his phone.
[57:00.21]Books and magazines.
[57:05.97]Radio!
[57:07.75]This pirate radio fad correlates with similar phenomena, such as teen rebellion and folk music guitarists.
[57:17.10]According to my calculations, this is the perfect way to reach out to the kids.
[57:22.49]Is Twitch dying for anybody else?
[57:24.13]I don't think so.
[57:26.03]Not that I can see.
[57:26.65]If you say so.
[57:30.47]So how do I use pirate radio?
[57:33.54]Simply slip into the pirate radio station and broadcast this LP I've prepared.
[57:40.31]If my assumptions are correct, it will incite them to spontaneously create a happening.
[57:46.20]It's quite convincing.
[57:47.28]I even use their lingo.
[57:52.39]I'm still trying to think of where it is.
[57:56.67]God damn it.
[57:58.14]Get over this.
[57:59.56]I can't concentrate.
[58:02.70]God damn it.
[58:06.79]I just was thinking when I was in the car and driving down the road I think I was looking looking at a sign
[58:38.02]And on the sign, there was an ox, and then I think I put the pair of ox underwear.
[58:47.08]No, I don't want to take a fucking video clip.
[58:53.72]What do you mean, just go?
[59:02.13]There was a little cutscene there.
[59:05.01]Gotta find the pirate DJ, which he could be anywhere, so... They did a U-turn to do that to me.
[59:19.82]Hey, why don't y'all start dancing?
[59:22.28]Alright, what do you know about pirate radio?
[59:26.80]Right, back to the office to finish books, then I'll nip off to Brixton for a quick anonymous snog in the stag cinema.
[59:32.89]Then back down to Kensington to get his wife.
[59:35.07]Whoopie!
[59:35.59]What about you?
[59:37.77]Strange.
[59:38.77]You'd think the buildings in Soho would make it difficult to send out a clear signal.
[59:42.97]Soho!
[59:43.62]A pirate DJ manages nicely.
[59:46.34]Up in Soho!
[59:49.66]Hearing 101 flashback, man.
[59:52.04]Very, uh... Alright, Soho.
[59:55.73]Hey, we're right next to Soho.
[59:58.80]Why don't we take a closer look?
[60:06.08]You want to think more about phones?
[60:07.64]Me too.
[60:08.12]It's right here.
[60:09.64]Found it.
[60:09.96]He's right behind this wall.
[60:11.50]Probably.
[60:11.96]I would think there he is.
[60:25.73]I think I got it.
[60:26.51]Complete.
[60:26.89]Defend the turntable.
[60:31.89]Oh, shit.
[60:32.67]I didn't get any ammo for this.
[61:00.04]Come on, scoop him up.
[61:02.42]There's so fucking many of you people.
[61:06.26]What the fuck?
[61:07.14]I'm dead.
[61:26.60]What?
[61:27.20]What happened?
[61:27.68]I don't understand.
[61:28.38]I don't know what happened there, but we're okay.
[61:32.34]Alright, back to it.
[61:33.48]Transmog again.
[61:54.67]This thing is so effective at taking out ground units, is what I was just going to say.
[61:59.15]But that is technically accurate.
[62:00.45]Switch!
[62:12.54]Go.
[62:13.76]Get the brain.
[62:14.70]No.
[62:14.82]20 seconds.
[62:15.18]Come on.
[62:15.62]Don't blow it here.
[62:16.24]No.
[62:16.38]It's so close.
[62:17.35]10 seconds.
[62:43.67]Jesus!
[62:45.45]Alright, I got it.
[62:46.49]Two seconds.
[62:46.91]One second.
[62:47.39]Complete.
[62:48.73]What?
[62:48.91]Hustle, hustle, hustle.
[62:49.85]Infiltrate the hustle.
[63:07.01]Okay, we're good.
[63:10.51]Actually, no.
[63:10.91]I don't want a police officer.
[63:19.69]No, don't scam him.
[63:20.70]Pick him up.
[63:21.20]I don't want to scam the guy.
[63:22.18]There we go.
[63:23.02]Around the corner.
[63:37.90]What's the chance that Kim is hiding it for content?
[63:40.12]Zero.
[63:43.04]Like, 100% zero.
[63:43.82]It's not.
[63:54.64]It's impossible.
[63:57.12]Because more than an hour before the stream started, I was looking for it.
[64:01.14]It wasn't like, oh, hey, I'm going to hide this on Jeremy.
[64:03.40]It's going to be really funny.
[64:10.02]100% zero certain.
[64:15.19]We made it.
[64:19.53]I almost just walked into the water because I was looking over a chat seeing what people are saying.
[64:27.77]It's gonna be fine.
[64:31.32]I'm gonna tear this house in half.
[64:33.64]Now get in there and start persuading those teens.
[64:38.19]There's a guy in the military?
[64:39.40]Oh no, not this.
[64:42.86]I gotta get this right.
[64:43.56]Uh, excuse me.
[64:48.56]Uh, yo, listen up.
[64:52.87]Hello, hello, hello.
[64:55.49]What's all this then?
[64:57.83]I don't know, copper.
[64:58.97]What's he look like?
[65:10.85]I'm going to have to make it.
[65:11.67]I got to get out of here.
[65:12.37]Make excuses and leave.
[65:15.25]I need a different costume.
[65:20.27]Perhaps I have the wrong address.
[65:23.72]Did anyone here order a singing telegram?
[65:28.44]We bloody well didn't.
[65:29.56]Now clear off.
[65:30.18]Alright.
[65:30.56]I got to be like a hippie for this.
[65:37.59]I need a hippie costume.
[65:39.14]You look like I could... You look like a good candidate.
[65:51.99]Clean snatch.
[65:52.91]Alright.
[65:55.53]He dabbed.
[65:56.89]Did he though?
[65:57.59]Or are you just saying that?
[66:03.84]Excuse me.
[66:05.74]Uh, yo, listen up.
[66:09.45]Alright, persuade.
[66:10.15]Brothers and sisters, I got it.
[66:12.49]That's not a dab.
[66:13.17]That's the pot potato.
[66:14.51]The doors of my consciousness have been flung wide open.
[66:19.09]I'm, it's all happening, you know?
[66:22.09]Anyway.
[66:23.85]This guy sucks at improv.
[66:25.57]Suddenly I'm wondering, what are we here for?
[66:30.63]Ask them to berate their selfish motives, insult crowd, make excuses.
[66:37.70]No.
[66:38.18]That dance is so dumb.
[66:39.04]Hey, add that to Fortnite.
[66:39.82]Oh, like Sammy the Snake.
[67:04.43]Feign concern for audience.
[67:05.88]Use philosophical argument.
[67:09.70]But at what price, man?
[67:11.98]How can you say your mind's agreed when you're still slaves to Revelate?
[67:17.64]But Revelate has liberated our souls.
[67:19.62]Half of these are already in for it.
[67:21.00]Besides, we can quit any time we want to.
[67:25.94]Tell them the truth.
[67:26.68]Tell them to free themselves.
[67:28.00]Liberated your souls?
[67:30.48]Gee, where do I start?
[67:32.50]Look, first off, you don't have a... No, no, you're not ready for that one.
[67:39.76]Look, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[67:44.15]Push chat.
[67:44.55]Dab, QB.
[67:45.05]Dig a bourgeois construct.
[67:50.39]Don't you get it?
[67:51.87]The only way to be free is to stop wanting to.
[67:55.85]Discipline is freedom.
[67:56.87]No, these are Demon's Souls.
[67:57.96]What is this?
[67:59.60]Hold on, we're gonna... Alright, feign concern for audience.
[68:08.24]Look at yourself.
[68:09.90]Strung out, smelly, dressed like you fell through a homeless shelter window.
[68:16.56]Speak for yourself.
[68:18.14]My clothes make a statement about who I am in society.
[68:22.54]There it is again.
[68:23.69]That dance.
[68:27.22]Decry superficial appearances, insult crowd.
[68:29.42]Decry superficial appearances.
[68:31.02]Forget the clothes and the hair.
[68:33.56]They're just trappings.
[68:35.14]They're not the real you.
[68:36.86]The real you transcends fashion.
[68:39.55]This guy's got a great 3D movie maker outfit on.
[68:42.83]I suppose we should all get crew cuts to go to work for the man then.
[68:46.03]Is that it?
[68:47.19]No.
[68:48.29]Rebel against the man in your minds.
[68:52.28]Take the system apart from inside.
[68:55.00]You dig?
[68:56.49]I dig.
[68:56.75]Criticizing his fashion.
[68:58.31]By the way, I love the no country for old men haircut this guy has.
[69:28.62]Javier Bardem, right?
[69:34.30]Can you stand still, sir, please?
[69:37.85]Can you step out of the car, please, sir?
[69:41.07]What a fucking outrageous movie.
[69:46.53]How much have you ever lost an acquaintance?
[69:50.43]Well, if you reckon, I don't understand.
[69:53.95]I don't think very much.
[69:55.43]How much have you ever lost an acquaintance?
[70:01.67]Alright, I did it.
[70:02.11]Did you say that movie sucks?
[70:06.17]What?
[70:07.59]That movie does not suck.
[70:08.69]Oh, actually, that... That's a pretty good movie.
[70:12.48]It's a great movie.
[70:13.02]If you've never seen No Country for Old Men, watch it.
[70:16.32]It's a great movie.
[70:21.48]Javier Bardem won the Academy Award in that movie, didn't he?
[70:27.30]He's so sadistic.
[70:29.95]Everything about him is terrifying.
[70:31.21]And he has this haircut.
[70:37.75]Alright, where are we off to?
[70:38.35]Yeah, it was close enough.
[70:39.19]Right, let's do a main story mission.
[70:45.55]Uh-oh, we're about to run into... Hold on!
[70:53.01]What?
[70:53.57]No, get... Get back in him.
[70:59.21]That's got to be painful.
[71:00.35]Okay.
[71:00.63]All clear.
[71:05.84]Oh, right.
[71:07.10]I want to see... What is this Demon's Souls clip?
[71:22.33]I need to see what this is.
[71:23.63]Take my mind off of that thing that starts with a PH.
[71:28.69]The dab that I know.
[71:29.94]The dab that I want to do.
[71:33.86]What did I do here?
[71:34.44]Got a little bit of a coffee spill here.
[71:44.64]Let me just take care of it.
[71:47.88]Make sure you don't like see my lower body.
[71:52.40]Stab on spring.
[71:55.38]Oh boy, that was bad.
[71:57.34]Oh man.
[72:00.29]Oh, that was like, it was like your grandfather made that joke.
[72:04.53]That was a grandfather joke.
[72:10.37]It's like a fucking 70 year old man.
[72:14.34]You know, it's the same word, so therefore it's funny because it's a different thing, but it's the same word.
[72:22.10]Isn't that funny?
[72:23.88]Isn't that just interesting?
[72:25.86]Different words can mean... Same words can mean different things.
[72:34.40]There we go.
[72:36.76]No country for old jokes.
[72:39.48]Oh, there's the secret agent.
[72:46.30]Hiya, hot stuff.
[72:48.01]Sorry to keep you waiting.
[72:51.25]Hey, what's happening?
[72:52.23]So what's the buzz, baby?
[72:54.27]Tell me what's a happening.
[72:55.51]Baby?
[72:56.57]I'm so glad you asked, baby.
[72:59.46]I have to meet my contact, Agent Sergei.
[73:01.66]He says he's got vital information for me.
[73:04.72]Unfortunately, he fears they may be on to him.
[73:06.52]Like they may be a fucking alien right there behind me.
[73:09.83]Just pick up all the information I can.
[73:13.69]And then head back.
[73:14.51]To the embassy.
[73:15.03]And call the fucking Ghostbusters.
[73:16.31]Also, remember.
[73:16.77]Eat what's in the fridge here, mate.
[73:19.51]You're eating out way too much.
[73:20.48]I'm going to start getting fit.
[73:36.79]This inside man of yours, what's he found that's worth risking his life to get to you?
[73:43.98]Sergei feels as I do.
[73:45.70]That someone or something has perverted the KGB and even the Soviet government.
[73:51.20]And people who ask why have had a troubling tendency to disappear.
[73:55.65]Hmm, Soviet dissidents disappearing.
[73:57.63]Stop making fun of British people.
[73:58.67]I'm not.
[73:59.17]You're right.
[74:00.11]That is weird.
[74:01.87]Look, can you really trust this guy, Sergei?
[74:03.79]I didn't have an accent.
[74:04.55]That's not even a British accent.
[74:05.42]I mean, how do we know he's not playing both sides?
[74:08.82]I trust him implicitly.
[74:10.64]Sergei and I, we have a history.
[74:14.67]How many times have you guys heard me talk like this?
[74:17.29]Oh, hey, let me tell you something.
[74:19.27]Motherfucker, I'll tell you something now.
[74:21.93]We're down all the way in the southern part.
[74:23.81]I've done it like a thousand times.
[74:26.00]I do one shitty British accent and all of a sudden people start to fucking lose their minds.
[74:30.06]So let's say I help you out.
[74:32.40]What's in it for me?
[74:33.88]Aside from your witching company, of course.
[74:37.10]I got lost in that one.
[74:38.34]A piece of your mothership.
[74:40.38]Sergei has agreed to procure it for you in exchange for helping us matter.
[74:45.56]I can do better than that.
[74:46.82]Hold on.
[74:47.92]Like a gag.
[74:48.66]Although I would have done it for your company.
[74:51.72]That was insultingly bad.
[74:57.98]Oh, a phantom.
[75:02.31]There.
[75:03.59]Hold on.
[75:04.03]I'll get it.
[75:06.75]Okay.
[75:09.34]Alright, I'm gonna... I can't do it, alright?!
[75:11.84]Like, it's just too much pressure!
[75:17.59]He just died on his own.
[75:18.89]What do you mean we've been spotted?
[75:32.86]That's Australian.
[75:35.14]No, it's called... She's a better gun than me.
[75:38.56]How come I just can't... No, she's... I want just a regular gun.
[75:48.15]Don't get hit.
[75:48.55]Don't get hit.
[75:48.89]Don't get hit.
[75:53.15]The term is shotgun.
[75:56.53]What if I just do this?
[75:57.33]It's time to... Let's just make people dance.
[76:02.90]I'm just gonna get into disguise.
[76:03.90]I can't.
[76:05.26]There's a lot of police.
[76:12.75]Oh, please.
[76:18.59]Get in there.
[76:25.63]What was he shooting at?
[76:28.19]Oh, her.
[76:28.83]Right.
[76:30.71]I'm dead.
[76:37.02]This fucking guy, man.
[76:37.78]It's really good.
[76:38.20]Every time I try to fight this guy.
[76:46.83]You know, I feel like I used to be able to do this.
[76:50.09]Okay, now let's go.
[76:59.03]Well, that works on her too.
[77:00.97]I guess she is a human.
[77:07.18]American accent only.
[77:08.50]Okay, I'll try.
[77:09.26]Hello.
[77:14.08]How are you doing today, everyone?
[77:25.77]She didn't like that.
[77:30.57]We just have to destroy them.
[77:31.81]Just destroy them.
[77:40.49]I'm getting my disintegration ray.
[77:48.27]And let me just suck the juice out of this thing.
[78:01.64]Got it.
[78:01.98]Okay.
[78:02.62]Let's move.
[78:04.12]Suck the juices out.
[78:10.32]Good, good, good.
[78:11.78]Alright, where is she?
[78:17.80]Let's go!
[78:18.18]What are you waiting for?
[78:18.90]I had to... Give me a break, lady.
[78:23.85]I'm gonna suck the juice out of this one in a minute.
[78:38.40]I think I'm the fastest clicker in the West.
[78:45.46]Still following me?
[78:48.12]Don't get hit by my bullets.
[78:49.58]Go, go, go!
[78:50.21]Suck the juices up.
[79:14.50]Mm-hmm.
[79:16.20]Alright, how far do we have to go?
[79:23.31]We're just terrorizing this whole city.
[79:25.29]Can we keep moving?
[79:26.33]Or do you just want target practice?
[79:32.22]Like, I understand, like, did you just install GTA, lady?
[79:36.42]I know, like, this is what you do.
[79:37.36]Don't even tell me that's not the first thing you do.
[79:44.27]You just... The first thing when you get control of the character is you just attack as many people.
[79:48.01]Let's just grant the thought of it.
[79:51.55]I'm an American.
[79:52.71]An American.
[79:53.51]An American.
[80:18.51]Spaceman, yup.
[80:19.61]Alright, I'm gonna do some probes, cause... Obviously have the ammo for it.
[80:23.73]And it's an instant kill.
[80:24.85]And no, you can't probe the car.
[80:28.15]Let's go!
[80:32.80]He's done for, come on.
[80:35.04]Forget about the guy driving your fucking car, let's go.
[80:37.90]Oh my god.
[80:40.70]She's not gonna move until he's dead, right?
[80:43.36]Shoot him.
[80:46.22]Fucking... You tourists!
[80:50.03]I almost just killed her, didn't I?
[80:51.97]Alright, we're good.
[80:56.47]Don't angle throw her.
[80:58.45]I would end the mission very quickly.
[80:59.99]Oh, this is where it ends.
[81:03.32]Thank god she's immune.
[81:04.14]KGB.
[81:04.98]Electrostatic.
[81:20.85]I need to get an upgrade to make this faster.
[81:29.73]A lot of action in this mission though.
[81:34.88]Did you just try to say moron?
[81:38.66]Where are you going?
[81:41.69]Are you just blocking me for fun?
[81:50.55]Military guys now, right?
[81:51.92]Alright, let me get some more ammo first.
[82:07.03]That should refill it all.
[82:07.91]Alright, let's go.
[82:13.57]Cross the bridge?
[82:14.39]What's even over here?
[82:16.51]Oh, nothing.
[82:17.97]We just have to go.
[82:22.83]Pick it up.
[82:24.71]I don't think there's anybody even in here that's a bad guy.
[82:35.21]Is it safer to do that?
[82:36.39]Is what he did just safer?
[82:38.37]It actually might be.
[82:40.01]I was about to give that guy shit, but that was probably the safe thing to do.
[82:44.90]That's so terrible.
[82:45.78]Oh, your house?
[82:46.56]Easy now.
[82:47.52]Don't die to explosions.
[82:50.98]Until I get some health here.
[82:52.26]Just hide behind the brick.
[83:20.89]Just dunk him.
[83:24.47]Thank God she has infinite health.
[83:30.92]No, just don't grind him.
[83:31.98]Just throw him over.
[83:32.76]Okay.
[83:39.76]I think we made it.
[83:58.72]I don't... I... I don't understand.
[84:03.88]She... She... She was inhaling bolts the whole time.
[84:12.55]Oh, God.
[84:15.87]Oh, God.
[84:24.34]She walks through a car running her over.
[84:28.04]How much help did she have?
[84:29.38]Did I just put the nail in the coffin?
[84:36.62]No, we gotta like just make people dance and shit.
[84:38.74]That's what I'm doing.
[84:39.34]Just make people dance.
[84:43.32]Can we move?
[84:43.94]No, she has to dance.
[84:45.16]Can I just carry her?
[84:46.00]I can't.
[84:51.96]Oh man.
[84:58.06]Oh, this is, this is not, this is bad.
[85:00.86]This is not, oh boy, oh boy, okay.
[85:07.81]God damn it.
[85:10.27]Just run right by them.
[85:15.99]Probe all the people that get in the way, she'll keep running.
[85:19.38]Let's make this quick.
[85:21.38]Did she just, I think that person just got their head run over.
[85:30.93]That's not even funny.
[85:31.79]That's just like, gross.
[85:32.79]Like, that's not even funny.
[85:34.49]That wasn't funny.
[85:36.35]It just wasn't.
[85:45.92]That was pretty funny enough.
[85:53.32]I need ammo.
[85:53.66]Transmog this!
[86:02.27]Why do you... Why?
[86:05.17]Let me do it.
[86:06.87]Let me do it.
[86:10.83]Why are you doing this?
[86:12.73]It's just taking off.
[86:17.17]Go.
[86:17.39]Fuck it, just leave.
[86:38.70]Got it.
[86:38.88]Probes only.
[86:43.36]Probes only.
[86:44.54]It's so much quicker.
[86:50.56]I'm trying so hard right now.
[86:54.72]I have to say the magic words.
[86:58.40]What are the magic words?
[86:59.80]There.
[87:03.53]What are the magic words?
[87:06.03]Please?
[87:14.45]She's full health right now.
[87:16.42]She's perfectly fine.
[87:17.52]This is where she died last time.
[87:19.00]Right up here.
[87:19.46]After the bridge.
[87:27.96]No, I want probes.
[87:28.82]I don't want anything else.
[87:32.73]You're trying to kill me right now, lady.
[87:37.29]Not pleasant.
[87:39.07]What are you waiting for?
[87:40.59]Let's go.
[87:45.77]One more probe, and then I gotta refill.
[87:47.73]Probes, probes, probes, probes, probes.
[87:53.38]There's no probes in there.
[87:54.30]Yeah, there is.
[87:54.70]Good.
[87:58.54]Shoot it.
[87:59.00]Why?
[87:59.66]What the?
[88:00.54]Oh, this... Wait, that... It's because that stupid thing is over here.
[88:07.37]Okay.
[88:15.66]Don't blow it up.
[88:18.22]She died here last time.
[88:24.63]Headshot.
[88:25.09]Come on, right in the head.
[88:29.35]He's dead.
[88:30.59]That's it, right?
[88:31.09]Let's go.
[88:41.61]What are you waiting for?
[88:43.73]Stop standing around!
[88:47.30]Natalia, please.
[88:52.14]Oh crap.
[89:00.60]Oh crap.
[89:06.89]Don't get hit by that explosion.
[89:07.87]She didn't get hit by it, right?
[89:10.25]Catch me!
[89:18.62]I wanna make that faster, seriously.
[89:20.00]Alright, let's go.
[89:25.36]Probe it up.
[89:27.45]No, I'm not gonna probe her.
[89:28.53]That mission will end.
[89:30.43]I'm not ending this whole thing right now.
[89:43.36]How many times have you seen me do that?
[89:47.57]What do you mean this way?
[89:51.93]Why are you telling me to come backwards?
[89:58.86]What do you mean this way?
[90:02.38]Okay, uh... Yeah?
[90:05.74]You just wanted me to come back to you.
[90:08.22]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[90:11.21]Oh my god, I'm gonna die because of that!
[90:20.32]I don't want to do this again.
[90:22.48]I got to hide.
[90:23.20]Go.
[90:53.89]Alright, this is where she died last time.
[90:56.51]She's at 50% health.
[90:57.47]I'm gonna start throwing shit around here.
[91:03.50]Good, good.
[91:10.04]So far, so good.
[91:11.40]Okay, she can't walk through this.
[91:18.31]I can't.
[91:18.55]Can I pick it up?
[91:19.01]I'm just gonna transmit.
[91:20.07]Whoa!
[91:26.28]Fucking god, dude.
[91:31.38]Don't!
[91:31.90]Please don't blow it up!
[91:45.21]Okay.
[91:48.31]Almost there.
[91:52.43]Don't walk over there.
[91:57.53]Thank God it's over.
[91:59.51]At least I hope it is.
[92:00.11]Oh my fucking God, dude.
[92:02.33]This shit ain't even... Look at all this.
[92:04.09]Don't fucking blow up, lady.
[92:36.74]Oh my god!
[92:38.01]Oh god!
[92:44.43]She's gonna die!
[93:08.79]Ammo, ammo, ammo, ammo, ammo, ammo.
[93:11.47]Let's go.
[93:12.80]This has to be the end, right?
[93:13.80]This mission would be ridiculous if there's more.
[93:24.30]What more needs to be done?
[93:25.89]Mmm.
[93:43.31]That health pool is so small right now.
[93:45.89]I thought she just killed over.
[93:57.90]Die already.
[93:58.66]I'm out of ammo.
[93:59.62]Where's she going?
[94:00.12]This is very bad.
[94:03.46]This is very bad.
[94:13.91]Very bad.
[94:14.47]Out of ammo.
[94:18.05]Very bad.
[94:22.00]No!
[94:22.50]No!
[94:22.68]Where is she?
[94:24.60]No!
[94:25.24]Just move!
[94:33.78]Thank you.
[94:34.16]We got it.
[94:36.66]My word, that was difficult.
[94:42.69]Oh my lord.
[94:45.28]Why was I not using free love?
[94:46.34]I don't think I couldn't use it on them.
[94:47.44]I had to get a disguise.
[94:48.73]No, I was in a disguise before and they saw right through it.
[94:53.75]Well, it was already behind you.
[95:11.81]My saucer?
[95:13.17]You didn't say anything about my saucer.
[95:15.81]What do you need that for?
[95:17.93]Because you won't be able to keep up with me on foot once I start driving, silly.
[95:22.70]Oh, no.
[95:23.30]Besides, the KGB will surely bring out their heavy artillery soon.
[95:27.98]So you may want to even the odds with a little air support.
[95:30.46]There's more.
[95:30.94]You understand, don't you?
[95:32.86]Yeah, I can.
[95:34.20]I really hope this doesn't start over.
[95:35.42]You just want me for my saucer.
[95:38.24]And your bewitching company.
[95:43.21]No.
[95:44.35]There's like a whole fade to black here.
[95:50.21]Definitely, this is not the... This is the checkpoint.
[95:59.26]Protect her.
[95:59.82]Oh, man.
[96:12.47]No, she's going this way.
[96:28.08]Those people had nothing to do with this.
[96:32.30]Oh my god, there's so many things.
[96:33.62]Those people had no... This is tanked.
[96:45.72]No!
[96:46.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[96:50.10]Air shot!
[96:54.35]Alright, this thing is max upgraded.
[97:01.47]I'm just using it.
[97:02.79]I'm just gonna spray the whole entire area.
[97:06.19]We should go in the other way.
[97:08.76]Oh no, her like 1974 Chevy versus a fucking bunch of tanks.
[97:19.66]God damn it.
[97:23.98]Ow.
[97:29.44]You have to go this way or you're gonna go to the bridge.
[97:33.34]Something is in Natalia's drink.
[97:37.67]It's a fly.
[97:45.41]Don't shoot her.
[97:54.53]I can't go underneath the bridge!
[97:55.95]I thought I could slide under it.
[98:08.29]Well, this car is essentially... This thing can probably take an atomic bomb.
[98:12.45]Look at this.
[98:19.09]We're good.
[98:20.20]Keep going this way, right?
[98:22.28]No, there's debris in our way.
[98:26.46]Go.
[98:33.45]This mission is rough.
[98:46.32]No, not on the tank.
[98:52.04]I have to be like cleaning up the road.
[99:03.05]That's a case where you instantly throw if you're in there.
[99:05.69]The amount of G-forces that are going upside down.
[99:16.58]Oh, god damn it.
[99:17.46]It's clear.
[99:19.34]Go.
[99:20.53]You gotta go now, because, like, I can't do this for long.
[99:28.69]Jesus, man.
[99:29.39]Like, why is every single car a tank?
[99:38.36]What is this?
[99:39.04]So that's her contact.
[99:41.45]Smarmy looking bastard.
[99:43.67]Oh, okay.
[99:45.37]This is me and the ship.
[99:47.87]Damn it, Crypto.
[99:49.25]Focus.
[99:49.91]She's just a chick.
[99:51.30]A human chick.
[99:52.70]You barely know her.
[99:54.18]A hideous, repulsive human chick who smells really good.
[100:00.08]No, no.
[100:00.88]Focus, damn it.
[100:04.90]I found what I was after.
[100:06.82]Just thought I'd say goodbye.
[100:08.18]I might not see you for a while.
[100:11.06]What about when I... It's an old RF tuner.
[100:13.22]That's not a walkie-talkie.
[100:14.26]It's been arranged.
[100:15.52]A piece of your spaceship has been hidden nearby.
[100:18.06]Here are the coordinates.
[100:19.18]She pulled that off the side of a electrical grid.
[100:22.00]She's pretending.
[100:22.70]This is just role-playing right now.
[100:24.18]At least, not too often.
[100:26.05]Yowza.
[100:27.75]Yowza.
[100:33.39]Mission complete.
[100:34.47]Very good.
[100:35.27]A weapon data core?
[100:39.23]Where's the data core?
[100:42.67]Over here?
[100:43.71]It's not up on top of the roof, is it?
[100:48.66]No.
[100:50.74]Right there.
[100:51.52]I gotta get out of this.
[100:54.84]You heard this is the most mature channel on Twitch.
[101:03.09]What do you mean?
[101:04.33]This is the most mature channel?
[101:07.09]I had some things to blend.
[101:15.42]Mature?
[101:15.78]What do you mean mature?
[101:16.60]I like to think that we're fairly mature here.
[101:23.14]I mean, sometimes you say something weird.
[101:29.03]It's alright, though.
[101:37.52]Bring the alert down.
[101:38.46]Okay, where was it?
[101:40.84]Over here?
[101:42.12]Right there.
[101:47.31]I think maturity is... I don't know how much, you know, like what does that even mean?
[101:56.57]You know, 30 is the new 20.
[101:58.77]40 is the new 25.
[102:00.04]You know what I mean?
[102:01.76]People are living to be like 120 years old.
[102:04.46]Like, am I acting my age?
[102:06.66]Or am I, you know, just right on point?
[102:12.88]Meteor Strike.
[102:16.37]Want to level a building without getting into your saucer?
[102:18.31]The Meteor Strike is a weapon for you.
[102:21.90]Meteor Lock will appear over your target.
[102:23.50]When the Meteor Lock is affixed on the target, it will turn red and release R1.
[102:59.93]Looked up at it.
[103:07.81]She lived!
[103:10.63]I don't know how, but apparently... And I don't have any more of those.
[103:13.53]I want to do that again.
[103:22.66]Have I ever been on a stage performance before?
[103:29.55]Oh yeah, I was in plays and stuff when I was younger.
[103:32.63]Long time ago.
[103:33.19]I want to do another one.
[103:38.38]I want to do that again.
[103:42.88]Is that a transmog or do I have to actually... I'm going to assume transmog the tank.
[103:48.36]No, I can't.
[103:49.00]I need to upgrade.
[103:50.96]I bet you I get it from tanks though.
[103:53.36]I don't think I'm going to get it from here.
[103:55.18]No, no way.
[104:00.32]Let's keep going.
[104:04.71]Let's keep moving.
[104:05.45]This is the building I destroyed.
[104:08.67]Uh, how far away is this?
[104:10.36]It's actually kind of far away.
[104:11.20]Let's get on the plane.
[104:16.90]Tell us more about your childhood and your need for attention.
[104:21.19]I wanted to be in, like... I wanted to be in, like, Beauty and the Beast, man.
[104:25.78]That was, like, fun to me.
[104:28.64]My need for attention.
[104:32.58]He played one of the seven dwarves.
[104:34.03]That's funny, because that's not even a play.
[104:36.09]It shows how cultured you are about the... You know, the thespians.
[104:49.56]Yes, it is.
[104:50.04]No, it's not.
[104:50.86]That was a Disney... Disney made a cartoon and then somebody was like, let's make that a play, too.
[104:55.92]That's what Beauty and the Beast was, too.
[104:58.72]Yeah, I know.
[105:00.46]It wasn't originally a play.
[105:23.34]I still have orange alert.
[105:25.76]That's got to change.
[105:27.14]Does this work on cars and trucks and vehicles?
[105:34.77]No.
[105:36.03]Yes, it does.
[105:37.63]I was wrong.
[105:38.09]It actually does work.
[105:39.39]Are they going to go flying into the air?
[105:41.88]I did not expect that.
[105:45.64]I'm doing two.
[105:55.29]I gotta attach the rockets on the Garry's Mod.
[105:58.36]Oh my god.
[106:00.06]Where did you all come from?
[106:01.16]I think I need to die here.
[106:10.92]I attached the rockets on the Garry's Mod.
[106:18.45]Attack!
[106:21.08]Oh, he ducks.
[106:22.32]I'm under fire.
[106:23.20]Yeah, I gotta just... What, am I gonna do a G-Mod scream?
[106:27.68]Uh, probably never.
[106:28.38]High five!
[106:30.00]Oh... I'm still under fire?
[106:51.09]I don't think so.
[106:56.55]Still under fire.
[106:58.01]Don't ever do that again.
[107:02.53]I want to see if I can get all two in this guy.
[107:05.36]I'm going to get it again.
[107:07.40]Ready?
[107:07.72]When he comes back around.
[107:08.46]Oh, did I get it?
[107:12.28]No, I didn't get it.
[107:13.06]Damn it.
[107:16.46]I'm afraid of what?
[107:21.08]I just need to... I need to dislocate everybody here.
[107:23.34]Come on, just kill everybody.
[107:24.82]What's going on here?
[107:30.66]Okay, that's it, right?
[107:32.02]Nobody firing?
[107:35.62]Good.
[107:37.73]When was that Lisa stream?
[107:39.79]I haven't decided when it was streamed.
[107:43.27]Hmm?
[107:45.83]Make it quick, Monty.
[107:47.53]I got a date with one of them go-go chicks in the cages.
[107:51.52]Lordy, lordy.
[107:53.46]I appreciate your coming on such short notice, sir.
[107:56.00]This is of the greatest importance.
[108:00.46]Don't tell me polka dots are back in this season, right?
[108:04.69]Get me Mary Quant on the hotline.
[108:07.47]Actually, sir, it's pinstripes.
[108:09.37]Shall I give you the number of my tailor?
[108:16.16]Dental plan streaming.
[108:16.90]Yeah, we're just going to go over my plan.
[108:18.98]I'm going to go into my dental insurance and just scroll through.
[108:21.30]I'm going to get captured.
[108:25.26]You got to get the strength to hold the gun up and pull the trigger, man.
[108:35.75]When will they ever learn?
[108:44.46]I think it would be funny to stream a fake dentist appointment.
[108:47.75]Then have it be really scary.
[108:49.29]He's got all kinds of drills and stuff.
[108:51.29]Like... And I'm like... Like in the chair screaming.
[108:54.95]He's doing all these fucked up things to me.
[108:57.49]Uh...
[109:09.08]what the hell is going on around here who the hell are you people right let's try four cc's of demo switch circuits to level three and prepare the encephalogram why was that that was a re no that was me doing that was a drill now I want you to tell me all the good things you remember about why would they give me a gun
[109:39.61]You know that the sound of a dental drill is considered one of the top, probably number one of worst sounding things in the world?
[110:05.77]Surveys have determined that it is the most grating sound ever made.
[110:19.67]well uh the first pulse creates a standing wave in the micro tunnel guide that eventually synchronizes all a nearby quantum states oh my freaking head subject is exhausted but don't be so mean damn when it touches your teeth we know you have it pretty terrible
[110:52.51]Eyelids peeled back.
[110:53.95]Excruciating torture.
[110:56.29]Endless hours of Ludwig van.
[111:02.90]Revert to childhood.
[111:04.28]Uncle Orthopoxy said I'm not supposed to talk to strange life forms.
[111:11.08]Good.
[111:11.70]Calibration completed.
[111:13.43]Now then, get some rest, Cryptosporidium.
[111:16.15]We can continue in the morning.
[111:20.87]When do I break out of here?
[111:33.52]That wasn't the line.
[111:40.77]Single revolver.
[111:43.22]What was all that about?
[111:44.90]Oh, my freaking head.
[111:48.57]This gas is noxious.
[111:50.90]Smells like Pox's underwear.
[111:53.72]What?
[111:54.30]Don't ask me how I know that.
[111:56.54]Why would you be smelling?
[111:58.26]Hey, hey, what the?
[112:00.18]God.
[112:00.40]Damn dirty apes.
[112:02.06]Where the hell am I?
[112:04.53]You're in the abscessed mental reconditioning facility under the streets of Albion.
[112:09.37]Looks like I got here just in time.
[112:11.19]Now come on, spaceman.
[112:12.73]Move your ass.
[112:14.09]I don't get it.
[112:14.57]This must be ours.
[112:15.41]Why are you helping me?
[112:17.80]I did not find my phone, no.
[112:23.36]I love how just to make sure you know that she's Russian, that she had a Russian operative.
[112:30.35]She has a little name tag.
[112:32.13]She's like Flareon that is, hey, look, it's Russia.
[112:36.49]Just in case you weren't aware.
[112:37.63]Oh, they did.
[112:47.06]That seems really awful.
[113:15.45]Anal probes.
[113:17.05]Let's try it.
[113:17.73]Okay.
[113:25.38]Okay, I did it.
[113:32.01]Brain extract.
[113:34.39]Target a human.
[113:35.55]It's just like in the other game.
[113:38.04]This throws a person with a mind flash when fully charged.
[113:40.56]Okay.
[113:41.44]Some humans are more resistant to ability of that as you have.
[113:45.30]Alright, we're good.
[113:47.51]How long does it last?
[113:48.23]Imagine having your brain sucked out while you were paralyzed like this.
[113:55.75]That would be horrible.
[114:00.04]He's very resistant.
[114:01.02]Do you think you could feel this happening?
[114:10.88]Assuming that works very, very... It's probably way easier to do on not a military personnel.
[114:19.65]I'm not even sure why I'm doing this right now.
[114:27.21]Just testing it out.
[114:31.22]Alright, we need a Zap-O-Matic.
[114:34.11]Your weapons have been disabled.
[114:35.31]Join Holopox in the par- Oh.
[114:37.77]So I have to just keep doing this.
[114:40.31]All I can do is my telekinetic.
[114:43.77]Wait, that thing doesn't dance, does it?
[114:48.74]Is it dancing?
[114:49.36]I can't tell.
[114:49.84]It's moving.
[114:50.42]Oh.
[115:04.94]What if it just started dancing?
[115:07.34]Protect me, please!
[115:10.72]No, let's go.
[115:11.48]Kinda didn't really need to do that right there, but whatever.
[115:35.22]He's thinking about dancing when he wakes up.
[115:38.86]That's all he can think about.
[115:39.84]He's like, man, I can't wait until this is over so I can start dancing.
[115:55.70]Clean.
[115:58.02]That's what I call clean.
[116:01.32]That wasn't very clean, but you understand the point, though.
[116:07.47]nice and clean wait hold on hey give it to me one more guy here is it one guy I need an upgrade from the gene blender oh please
[116:36.67]18% complete on that.
[116:38.41]Can I take his body?
[116:40.89]A golden gun.
[116:45.03]Alright, we're good.
[116:45.67]Let's get out of here.
[116:50.41]Oh, don't PK the... Fine, PK the fence.
[116:52.78]And me!
[117:05.78]This is not gonna work.
[117:12.84]Oh my fucking god, so many are coming down.
[117:14.67]What do I do?
[117:16.11]What do I do about this?
[117:16.93]Oh, fuck.
[117:44.46]I can't make these guys protect me.
[117:45.96]These guys' brains are too strong.
[117:51.24]They're dead.
[117:53.09]I can't do anything to those guys.
[117:54.59]You can't make them dance.
[117:55.85]You can't make them do anything.
[117:56.87]I'm just flying out of here.
[118:12.88]The dude just tripped.
[118:15.38]It's embarrassing.
[118:17.02]Okay, I made it.
[118:19.54]Flash them?
[118:20.04]I don't have any flash.
[118:21.04]I need to... I have to extract their brains.
[118:23.53]I have 50% brain capacity right now.
[118:35.18]These guys can dance.
[118:37.40]No, they can't.
[118:37.86]That's a fucking grenade.
[118:40.22]Goodbye.
[118:43.12]The other Flash.
[118:44.04]What are you?
[118:45.28]Alright.
[118:46.20]Can't even extract their brains.
[118:49.52]Just gotta get out of here.
[118:52.01]Alright, let's get some easy brain matter here.
[119:05.61]Just like picnic goers.
[119:13.11]It's the same amount of brain, too.
[119:14.21]Alright, I got it.
[119:16.12]So let's go over here.
[119:22.86]Get my weapons back, please.
[119:30.38]Hey, thank you.
[119:31.20]They're cultists.
[119:34.36]I'm gonna take a quick little pee when I get behind this mission.
[119:39.72]I'm going to panic look for the phone one more time.
[119:44.17]Frag about your clever escape.
[119:44.79]Check the trash.
[119:45.23]I'm gonna check the trash and I'm gonna go in the trash can.
[119:48.82]Uh...
[120:08.92]Suggest hypothesis.
[120:09.76]They claim it's for self-improvement.
[120:11.44]Why is the alien mouth so close to the voice acting?
[120:15.82]It's actually nice to watch.
[120:16.74]It may have been maybe dubbed over.
[120:37.23]You know, maybe it was like they did, like, lip matching or something.
[120:39.97]I don't know.
[120:41.87]Or maybe they just animated to the voice.
[120:43.03]I expected I'd find you here.
[120:44.77]You're quite sporting, Crypto, and I do admire your spirit.
[120:48.82]But at some point, one simply has to face the fact that the other man's won.
[120:53.24]Of course, you couldn't know who you were up against, M16.
[120:56.94]Or perhaps I should say, Majestic Command, 16th Sector.
[121:02.66]Yeah, it looks like it was definitely animated to the voices.
[121:05.10]Not the other way around.
[121:25.41]You've lost fair and square.
[121:28.06]Now be a man and show your little sportsmanship.
[121:31.44]There's a good fellow.
[121:32.54]No, never mind.
[121:33.32]I can't show you enough.
[121:33.96]Wait a minute!
[121:34.48]Wait a minute!
[121:36.22]Wait a minute!
[121:37.80]Is this a fuck my ass game?
[121:56.81]Oh wait, he's still alive!
[122:03.07]Oh wait, hold on, don't die from this.
[122:30.52]Gunfight.
[122:36.20]Oh, I just love when you just land every auto-attack, you know what I'm saying?
[122:39.74]That felt good.
[122:40.76]You bastard.
[122:41.34]Wait a minute!
[122:41.92]You finally did it.
[122:42.80]M16 was all there was left.
[122:58.72]the last of the majestic agencies all the others the french the mongolians the argentinians every one of them destroyed by aliens that last round must have scrambled your synapses I only took down the American majestic silhouettes majestic you
[123:28.85]There you go.
[123:30.76]No, you.
[123:31.70]What are you talking about?
[123:40.56]That's what they do.
[123:42.24]You don't see the phone.
[123:50.77]I didn't mean to skip the cutscene.
[123:52.17]I pressed X accidentally.
[124:05.38]I'm not redoing it.
[124:11.06]Who's this new guy?
[124:12.82]I kinda wanna die here.
[124:15.52]Just kill me so I can not have to do this.
[124:21.53]Actually, well, can I... Don't even need to die.
[124:27.89]He's only gonna talk to hippie females, okay.
[124:47.70]I committed crimes against Skyrim.
[124:51.10]If I had a little more time to prepare that one.
[124:55.05]That was too late.
[124:55.73]Where the hell am I?
[125:05.03]I want to pee.
[125:05.55]I want to pee.
[125:06.97]Then I'm going to find my iPhone and I'm going to smash it with a hammer.
[125:10.22]I'll be back in about two minutes.
[130:01.95]I got it.
[130:03.11]Not even kidding this time.
[130:05.29]You want to hear the story of where it was?
[130:06.39]Want to hear how fucking stupid this is?
[130:12.63]Yeah, listen, ready?
[130:13.28]Just so you know, like, it's, I got it in my hand right here.
[130:17.36]Take a look.
[130:23.50]Un-fucking-believable.
[130:27.11]Unbelievable.
[130:31.54]So I went to get a drink and I took out the iced tea that's in the cupboard.
[130:40.14]No, it's not in the cupboard.
[130:41.00]I told it backwards.
[130:43.46]Iced tea's in the fridge.
[130:44.22]Took it out.
[130:45.64]Set it down.
[130:46.14]I opened up the cupboard to where the glasses are and my phone's sitting in there where the glasses were.
[130:52.52]Why would it be the closed cupboard door with the glasses?
[130:59.27]I don't fucking know why it was there.
[131:01.86]Wasn't in the fridge.
[131:04.68]There's no reason why that would be up there.
[131:12.30]My God.
[131:13.06]Hey, should I tweet out the stream?
[131:14.56]Hey, let's tweet the stream out.
[131:15.74]Does that sound like fun?
[131:25.67]I've done that before.
[131:28.73]Why would you, why would you ever put it up and in like a top cupboard?
[131:35.29]That's not even easy to reach.
[131:37.34]Why?
[131:37.42]Alright, hold on.
[131:52.92]Screw all humans too.
[131:57.03]Is there an alien, like, emoto?
[132:00.99]There is, right?
[132:02.45]Yeah.
[132:07.18]Only two hours into the stream where I'm, like, tweeting it out.
[132:13.86]No, not tayetch.TV.
[132:23.35]Okay.
[132:24.49]Alright, I'm ready.
[132:28.09]I didn't mean to skip the cutscene.
[132:29.33]I was making a terrible fucking Skyrim reference.
[132:32.59]That wasn't funny.
[132:33.93]And I should be embarrassed for doing it.
[132:35.95]Alright, let's go.
[132:41.73]I need to get a disguise.
[132:43.40]I need a hippie disguise.
[132:44.44]Oh, well.
[132:52.32]Nah, I want to do one of the side dishes.
[132:53.48]I haven't done any of them yet.
[133:02.15]I almost got hit by the... Just dance first.
[133:05.48]Oh, I can't.
[133:07.38]I can only make the random people dance.
[133:11.50]Which then, does that make him dance too?
[133:12.80]It doesn't work on him.
[133:15.18]Oh, there's a hippie.
[133:16.93]Hippie man.
[133:18.81]Hippie man.
[133:21.37]Are these hippie girls?
[133:22.49]I don't know.
[133:24.41]Is everybody a hippie girl here?
[133:32.41]Okay.
[133:38.75]I need to upgrade this shit.
[133:43.70]I gotta collect some people.
[133:44.74]Because I can't do the dance or... It's kind of annoying.
[133:49.00]I have to do some extracting people.
[133:53.82]Hippie.
[133:55.57]Alright, dance.
[134:01.37]Okay, now let's go.
[134:05.23]This looks like a hippie girl, right?
[134:07.39]Let's go talk to that guy.
[134:18.42]I'm gonna extract him?
[134:19.82]Well, I'm gonna... You know, the word that is to describe that.
[134:25.64]This is not a hippie?
[134:28.14]You sure?
[134:34.14]I mean, you get like the big boots.
[134:39.79]You sure?
[134:41.65]Let's try it.
[134:43.09]No, that's a hippie.
[134:50.06]I'm sorry, have we met?
[134:53.17]Hey, what's the problem, sport?
[134:55.94]Sad about your shoes?
[134:57.82]Because if you're not, you should be.
[135:00.54]No, it's not my shoes.
[135:02.70]Well, it is, but you'd think it's silly.
[135:06.32]Try me.
[135:07.60]Yeah, it's those big go-go boots.
[135:09.22]Isn't that what it was?
[135:10.58]They used to wear them all the time.
[135:11.78]And now she calls herself Liam.
[135:16.13]So if Liz wants to be a man, that's his choice.
[135:20.39]What's it to you?
[135:22.20]She could never have done it if it was still the 50s.
[135:24.78]It's sick, perverted.
[135:26.82]The lady doth protest too much, me thanks.
[135:31.80]Oh, if only that were true.
[135:36.28]You may not believe this, but I think I can change your life.
[135:41.93]Just push off, will you?
[135:43.89]I'm miserable enough without your help.
[135:46.31]Thank God you're not a mind-reader.
[135:48.69]I wouldn't say that.
[135:54.33]Uh, okay.
[135:56.31]Ruined lives.
[135:57.01]Ruined this guy's life.
[135:59.61]Okay.
[135:59.75]So, disguises him.
[136:00.26]How do I... What do you mean, disguises him?
[136:20.66]Like, it's not disguise if you take over their body.
[136:28.02]Oh, okay.
[136:30.90]So now we have to tell, what are we going to tell the wife?
[136:36.72]How would I know the number?
[136:46.42]Am I talking?
[136:47.02]I'm personally so... Okay, I get it.
[137:14.25]Who's talking?
[137:14.69]Why would you need the disguise if you could just do it as a voice?
[137:18.80]You know what I mean?
[137:39.69]You don't need to look like him.
[137:41.71]Alright, we did find, okay, right here somewhere.
[137:48.31]Where you at?
[137:49.98]Is it you?
[137:50.40]What the fuck is, what, what, what?
[137:53.68]What are we talking about right now?
[137:55.72]What in the name of God?
[138:09.02]Oh, you're not the actor, and this can't be the scene.
[138:12.38]Look out!
[138:15.32]What about you?
[138:17.30]Man, I'm getting so sick of having to come down there.
[138:19.10]No, I don't hear it again.
[138:20.08]Oh, God.
[138:21.14]It's got to be easier as a woman.
[138:23.38]What's all this I hear about douching with vinegar?
[138:25.88]Do I have to call anybody else or just find this person?
[138:30.42]Apparently, just they're here somewhere.
[138:36.85]Just gotta look around.
[138:43.67]Don't do that with vinegar, please.
[138:46.35]I... I can't even imagine.
[138:51.21]No, no.
[138:52.31]Mostly lost.
[138:52.93]I'm not even going to read that one.
[138:56.19]Thank you for the one dollar, mostly lost.
[138:57.77]I'm not reading it.
[138:59.87]Is the pink dot on the map?
[139:00.93]No, the pink dot on the map is where the ship is.
[139:08.40]That's where the ship is currently landing.
[139:14.75]Isn't it?
[139:15.01]Yeah, that's where the ship is.
[139:16.71]Alright, Eddie's dead.
[139:22.32]Do I really have to do this all over again?
[139:29.38]No, I mean, I walked up and down the street.
[139:31.44]North, there's only two directions you can go on that street.
[139:38.08]He died because he didn't do the street.
[139:41.46]Why am I even saying it?
[139:42.76]Don't even say it.
[139:43.84]It's not even worth saying it.
[139:45.02]I'm just gonna get myself in trouble.
[139:55.77]Alright, let's do this again.
[139:56.63]Let's go.
[140:09.73]Okay, let's take his body.
[140:11.51]Dance!
[140:20.14]Do this again.
[140:21.28]Make a call.
[140:21.86]What?
[140:22.02]Oh, it's cause I skipped.
[140:23.26]I picked the wrong...
[140:41.72]There's an option to fail that dialog sequence.
[140:44.25]She just went back to where she was doing.
[140:52.75]Okay.
[140:55.87]I came out of her body and she went... Well, how was I supposed to know?
[141:02.11]I'm trying to do this quickly.
[141:03.39]Like, I didn't... Just trying to save you guys from having to see the whole thing again.
[141:07.34]Okay.
[141:15.08]I want to have the operation, but... Okay, there it is.
[141:16.88]I just didn't read his mind.
[141:17.86]Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[141:19.40]I'd have a go at the old pork cutlass.
[141:23.71]I caught you in my shots, you little twit.
[141:30.83]Are they going to shoot the lady?
[141:36.17]That would be depressing if they did.
[141:40.27]and now for something completely I don't think I can skip this at all I can't skip this one hello irene havisham speaking rainy it's me who's calling me I ask it's eddie eddie darling how lovely to hear from you have you got a cold you sound a bit under the weather you don't want to this up it's not that I'm I'm having a sex change operation you're what I've got you in my sights undetected
[142:09.79]I wish we could lose this phone, that's right.
[142:13.27]Alright.
[142:13.67]Let's go.
[142:35.09]Dr. Reni in North Parliament while disguised as Eddie.
[142:37.45]So we're in Parliament right now.
[142:39.93]North Parliament.
[142:47.22]That's the ship.
[142:48.72]That's not where she is.
[142:51.16]Still technically in Parliament.
[142:52.96]Maybe this road over here.
[142:53.88]Orange Circle.
[142:57.60]The Orange Circles are not where to go.
[143:03.62]It'll be over here.
[143:04.24]It's just in front of our house.
[143:06.78]So I'm assuming it has to be a place to come out the door.
[143:13.20]So we're currently north of Parliament right now.
[143:21.18]I don't see you.
[143:31.47]And we're about to run out of ability.
[143:35.38]Who's this?
[143:35.86]Are you dead?
[143:36.34]The person's like sleeping.
[143:40.52]Alright.
[143:40.84]Well, now we're in like Hyde Park.
[143:42.12]This is not correct.
[143:44.51]This is north of Parliament.
[143:46.45]And I'm going to lose him now.
[143:48.27]He's going to die.
[144:03.38]He's dead.
[144:04.54]Okay.
[144:06.40]Well... Keep going north?
[144:09.51]That's way north.
[144:11.57]How much further north do I have to go until it's in- you're literally in a different town.
[144:17.37]You're talking like... Up where like the Soviet embassy is?
[144:20.64]I was already up like past Hyde Park.
[144:23.30]I don't understand.
[144:25.40]Where the fuck is this?
[144:26.90]I went back and forth on this street, I went up and down this street.
[144:37.90]No, I'm not doing this thing.
[144:40.12]I'll come back to this later.
[144:43.01]I came up to here.
[144:44.85]This is not Parliament anymore.
[144:49.47]This is very clearly, like, we're getting into Hyde Park.
[144:54.47]It's up and left.
[145:07.32]So, you're talking about, like, where the ship landing zone is?
[145:10.30]Like, up there?
[145:11.08]Use the saucer.
[145:21.77]Uh, well, I'll come back to this.
[145:26.30]Because... I don't understand why I couldn't find it twice in a row there.
[145:39.41]Let's go back up.
[145:42.53]Let's do the other mission up here.
[145:46.53]Well, the mission didn't say north-left.
[145:48.31]It said north of Parliament.
[145:52.30]I mean, I guess... That would be technically north, but also all the way to the left.
[146:07.51]Use my phone.
[146:17.67]Well, north would not be north.
[146:19.57]That actually would be... That would be northwest.
[146:23.15]Not north.
[146:24.79]If you were given so many directions and you said, Hey, my house is directly north of where you're standing.
[146:29.15]And your house is actually northwest, they would literally walk in a straight line.
[146:32.51]North.
[146:33.65]You're never gonna find that house.
[146:35.07]Northwest.
[146:40.96]Where you're currently standing, just walk north, dude, you'll find it.
[146:45.10]I meant to say north-left, north-west, but, you know, fuck it.
[146:55.92]Remind me again why we couldn't meet someplace classier.
[147:00.36]Like, I don't know, a meatpacking plant?
[147:06.14]Ask her about that.
[147:07.02]Wachaken, sexy.
[147:09.53]I'm worried, Tavares.
[147:10.79]My sources are running dry.
[147:13.17]I can't risk further suspicion being cast on old friends.
[147:16.69]The time has come for action.
[147:19.74]Action?
[147:20.14]Well, it's about freaking time.
[147:23.40]What you got in mind?
[147:25.50]Burglary.
[147:26.67]I'm going to break into the Soviet embassy.
[147:30.83]Little of the old B&E, huh?
[147:32.76]Now you're talking my lingo.
[147:34.46]What's the snatch?
[147:36.48]All top secret information is in a heavily defended part of the compound.
[147:41.22]The cryptography room.
[147:43.46]Right on.
[147:44.44]That's practically my middle name.
[147:46.90]Well, my only name.
[147:49.89]So I noticed.
[147:51.45]I'm sure we'll find all the answers we need in there.
[147:54.03]I'm sorry to disappoint you, Crypto, but they seem to know all my old tricks.
[147:58.26]The North Lawn has been... Oh, by the way, are those people here?
[148:00.44]The old gate has been sealed up.
[148:03.04]They've even placed closed circuit cameras on the only other wall.
[148:05.78]This coming week, I'm going to try to do something.
[148:09.96]And it should be fun.
[148:14.51]I think... I think it's gonna work.
[148:17.25]Yeah, involve everybody here.
[148:18.31]Streamer tries to do something.
[148:19.48]No, this one doesn't require being in Las Vegas.
[148:20.96]I'm gonna try to get it situated by the middle or end of this coming week.
[148:47.25]I feel like it's going to be a lot of fun if it works.
[148:49.37]But that's the thing.
[148:50.97]It has to work.
[148:53.37]Smash security's cameras.
[148:54.25]I can do that.
[148:57.09]So, expect there to be a stream that involves all of you people.
[149:00.53]All of you guys.
[149:05.26]Hopefully within the next seven to ten days.
[149:08.68]It should happen.
[149:10.92]Ugh.
[149:13.62]Let's smash some cameras.
[149:15.68]Can I shoot them from here?
[149:19.48]Okay, I can just shoot them.
[149:21.07]Oh my god.
[149:22.17]I just wasn't realizing how lit up I was just getting apparently.
[149:29.29]I'm dead.
[149:32.13]Can I just turn?
[149:32.73]I don't have enough brain for this.
[149:37.28]Okay, after this, I am going to just do the brain collection thing, the abduct thing.
[149:42.96]Because I physically cannot do anything to these guys.
[149:45.62]I can't extract them, I can't take their form, I can't do anything.
[149:48.90]All I can do is just pick them up and throw them around.
[149:50.42]I need to collect them to be able to do that.
[149:54.25]In fact, this is probably going to be very difficult to do this without doing that first.
[150:01.91]I have to just kill them.
[150:02.77]That causes more alert, which then causes more problems, so I'm gonna have to... Yeah, I think I gotta do that.
[150:14.92]Let's do that first.
[150:21.41]I wonder if I can... Do they dance even?
[150:23.03]Do they even dance to this shit?
[150:25.41]The agents?
[150:26.87]I don't think they do.
[150:27.81]No, I guess they do.
[150:30.22]Alright.
[150:31.42]I guess I can just poke them, right?
[150:37.18]Alright.
[150:49.63]Over the hedge.
[150:50.09]See you later.
[150:50.43]Alright, let's just do it.
[150:51.65]I'm just going to do this quick.
[150:53.31]Or I'm going to step on a landmine.
[150:54.51]Why would there be landmines back here?
[150:55.91]Oh, shit.
[151:00.25]How many probes I need?
[151:16.05]One of those dumb things.
[151:18.05]Did I get it?
[151:19.72]No.
[151:22.16]Blow this thing up too.
[151:28.04]Is that hitting?
[151:31.30]I can't tell if that's hitting, is it?
[151:32.82]New movie unlocked.
[151:39.20]Interesting.
[151:47.49]Interesting.
[151:56.22]But if you guys want me to give you a hint.
[151:57.48]What do you think?
[151:58.48]Should I give a hint to what's going to happen probably next week?
[152:06.71]No, no hints?
[152:07.31]Okay.
[152:08.27]That was overwhelming.
[152:09.35]No.
[152:26.57]Hello?
[152:29.05]Hello?
[152:30.27]Really?
[152:30.93]No.
[152:31.39]Come on.
[152:34.95]Didn't I destroy this with the laser last... What?
[152:36.91]Is the thing going to be sub only?
[152:43.54]No.
[152:47.32]Literally every single person will be able to participate.
[152:49.69]Every single one.
[152:50.21]If there are 10,000 people here, every single one of those 10,000 people will have something to do.
[152:54.91]Oh, even me?
[152:58.45]Yeah.
[153:12.87]No, it's not Jack.
[153:13.77]It's not a video game.
[153:15.03]There's nothing to do with the video game.
[153:16.83]That's the only hint you're going to get.
[153:18.17]There's nothing to do with the video game.
[153:25.05]Up.
[153:26.17]No.
[153:27.03]Over.
[153:27.45]Come on.
[153:27.89]Go over.
[153:29.41]Get over.
[153:29.87]I mean, this is such a horrible way to die, but I feel like you deserve it at this point.
[153:39.36]See, I told you that was going to be bad.
[153:48.46]One more.
[153:52.36]What is all this?
[153:55.01]Jesus.
[153:55.57]Do I have anything else?
[153:58.71]Ooh, I got a meteor strike.
[153:59.61]Hold on.
[154:06.87]I'm gonna drop a meteor on that.
[154:14.43]Oh, no!
[154:23.02]Oh, thank goodness it's only one left.
[154:26.24]Oh, man.
[154:30.27]That was so sad.
[154:31.71]See?
[154:33.25]See?
[154:33.37]She gave me correct directions.
[155:03.41]Where's the red?
[155:11.27]Oh, slick.
[155:18.80]North left corner.
[155:39.15]That was a laugh call that I missed three times in a row, and it was awful.
[155:44.09]Distract-o-meter.
[155:46.70]North left-o-meter.
[155:48.84]Distract-o-meter this guy, come on.
[156:06.94]Don't die.
[156:10.26]Alright, distract more of them.
[156:16.79]Do I have to get into a huge crowd of them or something?
[156:22.67]I guess.
[156:27.42]Put them on the Roomba.
[156:28.58]That works.
[156:32.58]out of everything I need to I need to find an object hey kid you telling me that didn't set off that mine don't how they said we would have jet packs by now
[157:02.20]Health.
[157:02.60]Come on.
[157:13.21]Where's my health?
[157:14.29]Oh my fucking god.
[157:26.23]Thank you for giving me the Luigi.
[157:27.53]I appreciate it, game.
[157:28.39]For real.
[157:31.14]Thank you so much.
[157:35.79]What if I just stay up here?
[157:37.94]Oh wait, no, that didn't Luigi me.
[157:39.42]Do I have to arrange for this?
[158:05.93]I need to pull extract.
[158:08.29]I need an object to pull.
[158:10.65]They're gonna start shooting at... What have you all done over here?
[158:20.56]Why were you all standing here?
[158:24.66]You didn't even know I was up there.
[158:26.25]What the...
[158:32.27]Look, they're just, like, stuck over there.
[158:34.23]Do I have any more explosions?
[158:35.85]I do.
[158:36.41]Alright.
[158:36.71]You want a distraction game?
[158:39.53]How about this?
[158:40.13]No, wait a minute.
[158:43.23]Did that count retroactively?
[158:45.09]Oh, God.
[158:46.07]Damn it.
[158:46.39]Ugh.
[159:08.97]I might as well just die again, seriously, because that would be half the bar.
[159:12.15]Just kill me again.
[159:12.97]Okay.
[159:13.21]Please tell me again what I need to do.
[159:38.99]Man, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[159:44.10]Is it like a health upgrade that I'm missing?
[159:47.02]I'm getting just absolutely decimated.
[159:49.48]I'm getting destroyed.
[159:52.58]I have to go do some upgrades, dude.
[159:54.20]Seriously, I can't even stand getting shot for more than two seconds.
[159:57.62]This is insane.
[160:05.29]I'm just getting lit up like crazy.
[160:10.55]I feel like I'm like 30 levels under-leveled for this place.
[160:47.40]Let me drop a bomb right here.
[160:51.83]Alright, give me some distractions.
[160:53.93]There we go.
[160:55.99]Let me go disintegrate a ray.
[161:00.63]Oh, I'm not even halfway.
[161:01.89]I can't break that down.
[161:25.88]After this, we're doing a... We're doing an item run after this.
[161:31.80]There's another Sam site over there.
[161:33.28]Can I outrange you?
[161:36.60]Yes, I can.
[161:37.14]Okay, never mind.
[161:41.76]Does this hurt you?
[161:45.26]No.
[161:56.70]Thank God it's right here.
[162:04.32]Alright, we're good.
[162:09.77]Big tank.
[162:11.59]Big tank.
[162:13.31]I'm gonna get shot by one of these guys.
[162:17.73]Hide over here.
[162:20.83]You are not invisible.
[162:22.55]Fuck me, man.
[162:23.69]Fuck!
[162:24.09]They're just... Turned into Donald Duck.
[162:28.27]Alright.
[162:34.11]Can I abandon this mission?
[162:35.11]Because this is... I feel like this is impossible for me to do right now.
[162:43.64]These guys are... There's like a hundred of them.
[162:45.96]And I can't kill them fast enough.
[162:51.91]There's got to be another way to do this.
[163:03.06]I really need more of this.
[163:07.82]That was a fucking explosion right there.
[163:09.50]It was hidden by the box.
[163:16.60]How do I... Get me out of here.
[163:19.00]Nah, I'm done.
[163:20.56]Don't think so.
[163:21.71]I'm gonna upgrade my character.
[163:23.55]So this is not, like, impossible.
[163:29.11]Just get some weapons?
[163:30.19]You're like a level 10 in Northrend.
[163:31.87]Yeah, I'm starting to realize that real quick.
[163:38.78]Level 10 in Northrend.
[163:41.90]That was fun to do, though.
[163:45.72]What can I do?
[163:51.78]That's just never-ending frustration there.
[163:53.66]I don't want to do that.
[163:56.61]Okay, I got 23.
[164:01.19]Locked, locked, locked, locked.
[164:02.35]Alright, here we go.
[164:06.25]Crypto's shield strength.
[164:07.96]Yes.
[164:10.22]Definitely.
[164:10.94]So then 21's for the next one.
[164:14.09]I have Saucer at level 1.
[164:17.83]Yeah, I gotta... I need more of these.
[164:22.31]Desperately.
[164:26.55]These are all done.
[164:27.87]Death Ray.
[164:31.11]I don't think I can do anything else.
[164:34.00]Well, I could do this.
[164:34.82]Anti-Gravity for 15 seconds.
[164:37.46]I don't think I care about that right now.
[164:40.00]I think I'm going for...
[164:42.93]Disintegrate array.
[164:43.85]So I need 16, 8, I have 7 right now.
[164:50.47]Okay, I need to do some things here.
[164:51.99]Because I want more health as well.
[164:58.39]What about the blender too?
[164:59.87]Alright, let me get in the ship.
[165:06.38]I'm going to collect a bunch of people.
[165:07.58]Alright, let's get in.
[165:13.68]Distract with a saucer?
[165:14.84]I mean, I could do that.
[165:17.15]But I really need to get these upgrades.
[165:21.37]I really do.
[165:22.05]I need to pick up KGB, hippies.
[165:29.14]Cops too, right?
[165:29.80]I guess these guys are still in here.
[165:34.34]I thought they fell out.
[165:36.30]No, they didn't.
[165:40.66]Okay.
[165:40.80]Okay.
[165:44.73]Come on out.
[165:47.65]No, not you.
[165:50.11]Did I just pick that guy up out of mid-air?
[165:53.91]I don't know.
[165:55.57]I'm not sure.
[165:57.77]Keep your eyes peeled for a UFO in the skies over Albion.
[166:02.09]Urban, urban.
[166:03.13]What do we got?
[166:06.27]Need one more hippie and a secret agent.
[166:10.20]Can free love KGB and secret agents.
[166:12.16]This is really important.
[166:13.82]So I need one more hippie and I need a secret agent.
[166:18.14]Just a bunch of hippies.
[166:23.70]Secret agents and hippies.
[166:28.12]Army.
[166:30.13]Secret agent.
[166:36.79]How is this compared to the first one?
[166:39.38]They both have different qualities.
[166:40.49]I think I like this one more just because it's more open.
[166:46.99]It actually has, you know, mission markers that are open world.
[166:49.59]There's side missions.
[166:51.47]You could do side missions in the first one, but they were kind of the same exact thing over and over again.
[166:56.75]Do the checkpoint race.
[166:58.11]It's not that here.
[166:58.87]There's actual side content.
[167:00.33]I would say this one's probably a lot better.
[167:08.88]I think I have enough hippies.
[167:16.91]Yep.
[167:21.37]Here we go.
[167:21.69]Body snatch Albion's mods and hipsters at twice the rate.
[167:25.60]Okay.
[167:29.80]More urban.
[167:30.82]More upper class.
[167:32.34]Okay.
[167:36.60]I need a secret agent.
[167:41.87]Twice the rate.
[167:45.17]Even more.
[167:45.67]Unlocking even more.
[167:47.15]Oh god.
[167:50.08]So this next one is all urban.
[167:53.68]All cops.
[167:55.16]All army.
[167:56.98]We just have to keep pulling people in.
[168:05.40]Secret agent.
[168:05.90]There we go.
[168:06.36]Let's do that one right now.
[168:11.24]So I can actually free love the agents in KGB.
[168:19.23]Okay, got that one.
[168:21.05]Urban, urban, urban, cop, cop, army, army, army.
[168:25.58]That should, actually I can do this now.
[168:27.60]I can unlock the crypto art gallery.
[168:32.88]Need one more urban.
[168:41.84]That's not how I say that word?
[168:42.78]What do you mean?
[168:47.39]I need to shake out some army men here.
[168:50.85]I'm pretty confident I need those two.
[168:59.30]Yes.
[169:00.92]Body snatch cops.
[169:03.34]Army men.
[169:10.71]You think we're all bad at this?
[169:11.44]Let's find out.
[169:14.12]No.
[169:14.18]If I'm saying it wrong, it's GF.
[169:23.13]Sorry, I think you're confusing it with the peanut butter.
[169:30.69]Come on, get out of the back of that.
[169:32.41]There we go.
[169:32.99]Here's like the... I got the army mother load here.
[169:36.82]Don't kill them.
[169:53.70]Body snatch her majesty's soldiers at twice the rate.
[169:56.96]More, more.
[169:59.78]Can use protect on KGB and secret agents.
[170:02.11]That's what I want.
[170:07.15]Urban, only secret agents.
[170:10.99]Need more urban.
[170:15.27]I think that's alright for now.
[170:16.73]Because now I can actually... That was causing me a huge problem, because now if I... That last mission was all those KGBs, all the secret agents.
[170:27.17]I can actually make them dance now.
[170:29.93]Couldn't do anything with them before.
[170:33.97]Let's go back.
[170:38.25]I'm saying the word, but I'm not.
[170:42.71]No, I'm not.
[170:45.73]I have an accent when I say the word room.
[170:49.57]An accent when I say a lot of words.
[170:57.58]Sorry.
[170:58.72]Room.
[171:01.22]Up into your room.
[171:02.38]I don't want to go to my room.
[171:24.43]I actually can do the secret agents thing, can't I?
[171:26.05]Two more secret agents.
[171:28.29]Two more.
[171:28.57]Come on out.
[171:35.15]Get out of the car!
[171:36.81]Get out of the car!
[171:41.55]I'm sorry, get out of the car.
[171:51.64]One more secret agent and then we're done.
[171:55.46]I will find you.
[171:56.88]There you are.
[172:01.54]Blend it.
[172:05.80]That.
[172:06.38]Is.
[172:06.54]It.
[172:07.00]Alright.
[172:10.90]Park this thing.
[172:12.56]I need to make some more DNA.
[172:16.56]Which I actually might be able to do this mission now.
[172:18.30]I'm gonna give this one a try, because now I have more health and I can actually...
[172:25.60]Get in their heads.
[172:26.36]I wasn't able to do it before, so let's try it.
[172:31.78]Seven.
[172:32.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[172:35.38]I want full ammo.
[172:43.33]Transmog that.
[172:45.13]But I can do this to you guys now, so that's good.
[172:47.27]I probably should just die here.
[172:59.09]Up and away.
[173:04.51]How far away am I?
[173:09.24]I am fucking far away.
[173:10.34]Now I gotta go to this one.
[173:22.06]Transmog.
[173:22.50]Let's get some ammo before I do this mission.
[173:24.95]Ain't nothing in there.
[173:31.41]There's two canisters in there.
[173:32.99]How many do I have of each?
[173:34.55]I have one, one forty, five out of five.
[173:37.03]That's good enough.
[173:40.05]At least I hope it is.
[173:40.62]Alright, so what time is it right now?
[173:52.96]I need to be aware of the time.
[173:56.06]Still alright.
[173:58.01]I have a... someone coming to the house tomorrow.
[174:00.34]We're very early.
[174:02.62]So, I need to be... I need to get a lot of stuff ready.
[174:06.12]There is a junk company.
[174:11.41]That is going to come and take a bunch of stuff.
[174:14.21]The move is now real.
[174:24.67]Are they going to take the TV?
[174:25.91]Yes, they are.
[174:28.91]That's the... I had to call this company.
[174:33.39]Because of that television.
[174:37.71]So, yes.
[174:41.93]I have a really huge couch that's not in great shape.
[174:47.15]That I really don't want.
[174:49.17]I can't give it to somebody.
[174:50.31]Nobody wants it.
[174:50.93]It's huge and it's really fucking dirty.
[174:53.07]Nobody's going to want it.
[174:56.08]So there's a lot of just junk that I gotta get rid of and they're coming tomorrow.
[174:59.30]So I have to get everything in the right place.
[175:01.22]Pay respect to the TV.
[175:07.47]Look, hey, if it makes you guys feel any better, I'll keep a piece of it.
[175:12.67]I'll rip out one of the coaxial cables or something and I'll keep it forever.
[175:18.02]Put my house on Craigslist.
[175:20.22]What are you talking about?
[175:26.66]Auction it off?
[175:27.67]No, we already talked about this.
[175:28.89]Me shipping this TV is going to cost like $1,000.
[175:30.75]It's going to cost probably $5,000 to get this TV to somebody's house.
[175:35.89]That does not live down the street from me.
[175:38.87]That's like a $2,200 joke.
[175:44.35]We would track it on stream and stuff.
[175:46.43]No, we wouldn't because that's like addresses are involved.
[175:48.39]No, that's not gonna happen.
[175:49.43]Sorry.
[175:54.99]A lot of these guys are here now.
[175:58.41]Alright, but now I can do this.
[176:01.03]I couldn't do this before.
[176:01.89]This makes this... This makes this very easy, actually.
[176:05.91]So... Well, easy is not the right word, but... Not impossible.
[176:17.20]More health.
[176:19.42]Actually, I want to get rid of that right now.
[176:21.36]There that goes.
[176:27.45]Okay.
[176:27.87]We're setting ourselves up for victory later.
[176:31.07]You'll buy that TV for $15,000.
[176:32.51]No, you will not.
[176:34.67]You will not do that.
[176:36.64]You're not going to do that.
[176:49.46]It would only cost $80 to ship?
[176:54.25]They let you put stickers on regular boxes.
[176:56.95]I don't know how... This thing's 200 pounds.
[176:59.88]That is... This thing's gigantic.
[177:01.86]This thing's not going to fit in a priority box.
[177:06.20]This will not fit in a box.
[177:07.54]It's massive.
[177:11.33]I'm just going to steal it.
[177:19.03]You're not going to steal it.
[177:25.85]I'm already, like, dead.
[177:26.68]This mission sucks.
[177:32.34]Can you buy the dough?
[177:32.94]Dreamcast is coming with me.
[177:35.42]All this other random stuff is coming with me.
[177:37.45]A junk company is just coming to take care of all the stuff that I can't take with me.
[177:48.29]I can't extract these guys.
[177:51.65]I don't have that yet.
[177:53.61]Get one over here.
[177:59.48]Didn't we calculate this on stream?
[178:01.98]We did the dimensions of the thing and it said I couldn't ship it.
[178:05.46]I had to get special treatment.
[178:08.00]We already looked at this on stream.
[178:16.86]I remember we were sitting there, we were looking at like pricing for stuff.
[178:24.83]Yeah, it was like, it was a shitload of money.
[178:30.09]He said it was 400 pounds.
[178:31.29]200 or 400, doesn't matter.
[178:34.19]That's still too big to ship, but with like the United Postal Savers, whatever, the United Postal Savers.
[178:43.00]No, I need to transmog these, leave them.
[178:53.82]No, it's not worth the anal problem with these guys right now.
[178:55.81]I need to upgrade this weapon.
[178:58.89]This weapon is terrible.
[179:14.38]I mean, it's funny to do it to people for like 30 straight seconds, but practicality, not really.
[179:23.17]It's the same one, by the way.
[179:26.45]Same one.
[179:27.87]This exact thing, this happened last time.
[179:36.05]I can't ship it international.
[179:42.89]Yeah, I found the phone.
[179:49.29]Phone's good.
[179:49.81]Phone is found.
[179:55.87]He's inside of a cabinet with my glasses.
[180:03.72]Just rent a truck and ship it yourself.
[180:05.20]Look, Jerma delivers to you!
[180:06.66]It's a new service I'm running.
[180:10.68]I come right to your front door.
[180:11.92]I ring the doorbell and the camera crews are there and it's like, hey man.
[180:16.77]Ding dong.
[180:17.31]I got that TV.
[180:18.91]And then we like take a bunch of pictures together and I have a giant check for you to sign.
[180:23.15]I'm dead.
[180:23.53]Okay.
[180:44.21]Bingo.
[180:44.71]Remember this?
[180:45.83]Oh, come on.
[180:50.90]Really?
[180:51.14]You didn't let me have that?
[180:53.60]You did it the first time.
[180:55.22]Here we go.
[180:56.34]Give me the instructions.
[180:58.24]Here it comes.
[181:15.17]Give me the dance.
[181:18.55]No, not yet.
[181:19.01]Not yet.
[181:27.47]Distraction meter.
[181:28.11]There it is.
[181:28.65]Alright.
[181:29.03]Start dancing, everybody.
[181:32.70]Now we can take you out one by one.
[181:42.06]Makes this so much better.
[181:48.52]Somebody just crashed their car.
[181:51.76]I didn't have anything to do with that.
[181:53.02]Somebody actually just crashed.
[181:56.46]Alright.
[182:03.85]I can just do this.
[182:08.27]I'm not going to cause myself any undue frustration here.
[182:18.15]background side I don't have anything else.
[182:24.56]I could just do this from afar.
[182:26.16]Watch him fly around.
[182:26.98]I guess I was too far away.
[182:35.18]I guess so.
[182:37.50]Nice dodge.
[182:46.49]Call my neighbor and ask if he wants to play Fortnite.
[182:51.80]What are you talking about?
[182:53.68]I'm not going to play Fortnite with anybody.
[183:03.84]See if your neighbor wants to come over and play Fortnite with you.
[183:07.86]No.
[183:08.60]I do have.
[183:09.86]And you know what?
[183:13.20]Let's talk about something for a second here.
[183:17.23]I'll be right back.
[183:19.44]Stay there.
[183:20.76]Don't go anywhere.
[183:21.24]I got something to show you
[184:13.26]Eh?
[185:11.57]Okay, so Here So PUBG
[185:17.73]is on mobile, and so is Fortnite, but I don't want to play Fortnite.
[185:20.50]I don't like it.
[185:22.10]So here's a... I played on IP... I've been playing PUBG on iPad the last two nights in a row, right?
[185:28.64]I don't give a shit.
[185:29.38]Like, I'm just dicking around because it's, you know, if I get bored, I can lie in bed.
[185:33.64]Anyways, I took a screenshot last night.
[185:37.86]Take a look at this.
[185:38.92]This boy is pretty good, I think.
[185:42.93]I think this boy is pretty good.
[185:47.64]What's that?
[185:48.10]See that?
[185:49.16]19 kills?
[185:51.64]Let's zoom in so you can make sure you can see.
[185:53.46]I took this screenshot last night.
[185:57.83]What's that?
[186:00.01]And that's a fucking winner, winner, time for dinner, right?
[186:03.01]I'm pretty good.
[186:09.57]Photoshopped?
[186:10.21]What are you talking about, Photoshop?
[186:13.76]And yes, look, I did, I understand.
[186:16.02]My screen is broken.
[186:18.64]I stomped on this accidentally.
[186:20.44]I put it on the ground after I got out of bed.
[186:22.68]And I walked in and I pressed my heel into it.
[186:24.42]So it's like this sharp glass over there.
[186:26.16]Just watch your fingers when you're using it.
[186:29.22]See?
[186:29.44]Like up there?
[186:30.76]It's like just a broken screen.
[186:33.96]This is not like a... I'm not making this up.
[186:35.71]You think I'm making it up.
[186:37.99]They think I'm making it up.
[186:39.03]That's fine.
[186:42.73]No.
[186:43.13]They think I'm making it up.
[186:45.48]I stole that picture from somewhere.
[186:47.28]That's not my in-game name.
[186:56.21]Let's show it.
[186:57.31]Let's take a look.
[187:00.79]That couldn't possibly be you.
[187:02.03]You took that picture off the internet.
[187:03.59]You found that picture on Google.com.
[187:10.52]Here it comes.
[187:13.18]The camera's mirrored.
[187:17.16]No it didn't.
[187:18.08]Is it?
[187:19.44]The camera's mirrored?
[187:24.88]Look, let me fix it.
[187:32.66]It is mirrored, alright.
[187:35.08]So let's just do this.
[187:37.98]There, see, okay.
[187:40.90]Let me show you that screen again because everyone's freaking out.
[187:45.85]Where is it?
[187:46.19]My photos.
[187:48.29]And look, this is the last thing I looked up on the computer.
[187:51.45]Because everyone thought I was making that up too.
[187:54.03]I was looking up praying mantises because we've seen it there in Nevada.
[188:03.22]Where are my pictures?
[188:04.76]What happened to them?
[188:06.28]Okay, here we go.
[188:09.50]No, do not use the iCloud library.
[188:18.93]I think that's not on camera.
[188:22.08]Take a look at that screenshot.
[188:23.12]There it is.
[188:29.12]That's me that I'm ever going.
[188:32.32]That's number one, 19 player kills.
[188:35.52]Number one.
[188:37.98]And just to make sure everyone can see for transparency sake, we're here right now and take a look.
[188:43.59]What's that name in the corner?
[188:45.83]That's me, baby.
[188:47.81]That's me, Aragorn.
[188:48.97]Let's start, I'll show you.
[188:50.10]I'm not gonna do this right now.
[188:51.02]I'm not playing fucking PUBG Mobile in a face cam on top of Destroy All Humans 2.
[188:55.94]That's not gonna happen.
[189:01.53]Alright, let's go back to Destroy All Humans 2.
[189:08.41]What am I doing?
[189:14.18]Nice bot game.
[189:15.10]What do you mean bot game?
[189:16.98]Do you see bots here?
[189:18.82]I don't see bots.
[189:19.66]These are people.
[189:21.66]Look at, this is like the beginning of the game when people are there.
[189:24.07]They're walking around and like yelling at each other.
[189:27.57]What do you mean bots?
[189:29.91]There are no bots here.
[189:30.89]Look, they're doing this thing.
[189:31.57]Look, we're all lying down.
[189:32.79]We're like having fun together.
[189:35.90]Look, see?
[189:36.68]We're punching each other.
[189:37.58]What do you mean bots?
[189:41.10]There's 88 people in this lobby.
[189:46.74]Let me show you guys where I land.
[189:47.80]How am I going to do this?
[189:56.82]Oh, there's people talking.
[189:57.86]We don't want that.
[189:59.68]We want muted.
[190:00.37]Alright, so this is what you got to do.
[190:08.23]You don't want to go.
[190:08.85]You want to land.
[190:11.27]I don't usually like to go anywhere in the middle.
[190:12.81]I like to go on the outskirts.
[190:18.20]Let's go.
[190:18.52]You know, let's... Fuck it, man.
[190:19.80]Just jump.
[190:22.91]See this guy right there?
[190:23.49]That guy has the same idea.
[190:24.21]I'm going, right?
[190:24.63]I'm going to the hospital.
[190:25.35]Remember your face all the way down?
[190:30.65]Look, this is not an endorsement of this game.
[190:31.97]This game's stupid.
[190:34.00]No, it's... I mean, I play it, like, every night.
[190:35.94]On iPad only.
[190:38.30]And it's only been for, like, three days.
[190:42.33]Watch this.
[190:42.75]Ready?
[190:43.65]Guarantee I get... Look, I'm going to get a kill.
[190:45.84]I'm going to show you exactly how you get it done on the iPad.
[190:49.10]It plays real well on iPad.
[190:50.32]Check that out.
[190:51.44]Feel how smooth that is?
[190:54.48]There's a sprint.
[190:55.08]My favorite part about this, watch this.
[190:58.69]You just walk over items and you pick them up.
[191:00.67]Why is that not in PUBG?
[191:01.67]Look at this.
[191:01.93]I don't have to fucking do anything.
[191:04.51]It's already done.
[191:05.25]Picked up everything.
[191:05.85]This guy's going to be right here.
[191:09.59]If that was actually in the game, I would play PUBG on the actual desktop.
[191:16.72]Okay, hold on.
[191:17.22]Can you guys see?
[191:18.72]I'm in, like, an awkward situation here, though.
[191:21.04]This isn't ideal for me.
[191:24.24]Energy drink.
[191:24.82]Don't drink it.
[191:25.30]I don't need it.
[191:26.90]Choke with a... Okay, we got a helmet.
[191:28.45]We got another thing for the shotgun.
[191:31.27]Don't want that extended mag yet.
[191:32.35]Another thing you want to do is make sure, like, everybody knows where the fuck you are.
[191:38.64]Because they're like, bring him on, bring him on, you fucking little shits, you know what I'm saying?
[191:41.58]Okay, there's nothing here yet.
[191:46.79]I don't see anybody.
[191:51.55]You wonder how you get 19 kills on mobile?
[191:53.47]That's how.
[191:53.81]Alright, let's see what the play area is.
[191:56.53]Can I check this place?
[192:01.49]Not yet.
[192:03.51]Backpack.
[192:04.35]Good.
[192:08.29]That's all I need.
[192:09.21]Alright, let's get out of here.
[192:10.93]I'm already right in the middle.
[192:12.55]I don't have to go anywhere.
[192:13.33]I don't have to do a damn thing.
[192:16.51]Except there is a car here.
[192:18.37]Let's go grab the car real quick.
[192:19.68]98 people still living.
[192:26.92]You want to see?
[192:27.40]I'll show you.
[192:28.08]Check it out.
[192:29.52]Make sure that everybody knows.
[192:30.58]Turn it all the way up as loud as it can go.
[192:38.35]I'm going to say... Let's go this way.
[192:40.57]Let's actually go to the hospital.
[192:42.69]No, let's get back in there.
[192:44.41]I've got to get at least one kill so we can see just how good I am at this.
[192:50.85]Okay, right there.
[192:53.51]See anybody yet?
[192:54.11]I don't see anything.
[192:55.43]There is a car here, though.
[192:56.28]Hold on.
[192:56.58]Let's pull them out of the cave.
[193:01.84]Yeah, there's a guy here somewhere.
[193:06.84]There he is.
[193:17.25]That's how you play PUBG on mobile.
[193:23.94]What do you got?
[193:25.08]Oh my God, he had a bunch of shit.
[193:26.06]I gotta take this seriously now.
[193:27.04]Okay, hold on.
[193:34.71]Oh my God, he has like a fucking best sniper rifle in the game.
[193:57.00]Oh, they're all bots, Jeremy!
[193:58.22]You're fighting against bots!
[194:07.02]Oh, you're fighting against bots, Jeremy!
[194:08.46]I'll be at Invitational, don't you worry.
[194:16.64]That guy's knocked out, though.
[194:18.64]He's not dead.
[194:36.52]I just wasted so much ammo.
[194:48.73]I'm getting like uncomfortable.
[194:54.44]We're still good.
[194:58.40]Can you guys even see half the shit I'm doing?
[195:06.87]Where's my car?
[195:08.48]I have three squad mates that are over there.
[195:13.14]A nose is playing the iPad.
[195:20.49]Why am I doing this right now?
[195:21.85]I'm going to win the game.
[195:23.97]Live.
[195:25.01]In front of you guys.
[195:25.89]We're playing PUBG Mobile iPad.
[195:28.59]Don't touch the glass, though.
[195:29.58]You'll get cut.
[195:31.16]That's why I'm playing it this way.
[195:36.54]Get back in the car.
[195:38.72]We gotta use the secret technique.
[195:46.65]I'm gonna say, I'm gonna head this way.
[195:56.25]My hands are too sweaty!
[196:16.29]I'm tracking that guy down.
[196:25.06]I think he went over here.
[196:26.22]Easy, don't flip it.
[196:28.45]I hope I don't run out of battery.
[196:29.57]I don't want to go too far over here.
[196:38.34]I'm bleeding out too.
[196:39.14]Hold on, I gotta heal.
[196:46.79]Guy right there.
[196:48.11]With like two of his buddies.
[196:49.01]Watch this.
[196:57.24]Nobody there.
[196:58.02]Never mind.
[196:58.52]I was wrong.
[197:02.10]Only got two bullets.
[197:02.88]I need ammo.
[197:03.72]I gotta go find... Am I actually doing this right now?
[197:06.26]Like, am I actually fucking doing this right now?
[197:09.34]Should I stop doing this?
[197:10.32]I feel like I need to stop doing this.
[197:19.41]I almost just killed myself.
[197:23.31]I'm not actually gonna play this whole game, am I?
[197:30.15]Win or you're gonna unsub.
[197:39.47]This is fucking stupid.
[197:40.59]I don't even wanna do this right now, but I'm gonna get at least 10 kills.
[197:45.57]Check it.
[197:50.62]This is just a guy, one guy said it?
[197:53.42]Was that a one guy scenario?
[197:56.51]Tell me if that was a one guy scenario.
[198:02.03]Somebody just gave $50.
[198:02.77]Alright, here's something, hold on.
[198:05.87]I'm good right here, I can heal.
[198:09.89]Lorac, thank you for the $50, dude.
[198:12.87]And you say, hey Jeffrey, new Hearthstone update's looking good.
[198:17.39]This is pub battle.
[198:19.37]This is battlegrounds.
[198:22.75]Thank you so much, Loergman.
[198:23.97]Alright, there's an airdrop.
[198:25.09]We gotta get it.
[198:32.64]Somebody died here.
[198:33.88]Eight times scope.
[198:35.34]He got an eight times scope.
[198:38.80]Our game's already over.
[198:41.64]The game is actually over.
[198:42.86]I just got an eight times fucking scope.
[198:44.12]Game's over.
[198:56.82]He's got a buddy around here.
[199:01.86]He's got a buddy right here.
[199:08.74]Easy.
[199:12.40]Where's his teammate?
[199:24.58]This is all just, like, look at this environment a bit.
[199:26.92]I'm not even lying down with, like, a fucking cup of cocoa either.
[199:34.41]Not even in the best environment, he's still got four kills.
[199:39.91]Look at all this shit this guy had.
[199:42.21]Then, remember, because it's on iPad, I don't have to do anything at all.
[199:46.10]It just happens.
[199:46.72]I don't have to do anything.
[199:48.38]It just equipped all the items.
[199:50.06]Just be good at aiming.
[199:52.46]Somebody's shooting.
[199:56.45]Here comes the stink.
[199:59.15]Remember, if you don't know PUBG, don't stand in the stink.
[200:03.58]It'll do damage to you.
[200:05.30]There he is.
[200:05.60]See him?
[200:10.92]I tried to shoot twice by fucking thumbs.
[200:12.76]I would have shot him right in the head.
[200:19.11]I just saw me tap.
[200:19.71]The screen's broken.
[200:27.74]Alright, we're looking good.
[200:28.40]We're still right in the middle.
[200:35.81]Got a car up there.
[200:36.59]I'm going to pay attention to that.
[200:39.87]He's running the edge.
[201:06.49]It's cause I'm like leaning back.
[201:24.73]I gotta move.
[201:33.44]Let's get that airdrop.
[201:34.84]Oh, it's right there.
[201:36.08]Beautiful.
[201:36.50]Get in the car and get it.
[201:44.73]I'm sorry for those of you that really don't want to see this, but I have to prove to one guy that I can beat this game.
[202:02.33]We're still here.
[202:02.89]We're good.
[202:03.85]Look at the specs movement.
[202:05.13]Movement.
[202:05.81]No.
[202:05.99]Let's go.
[202:18.42]It's not a good spot to be in.
[202:21.02]If you could see the way that I'm moving, my neck is already in pain.
[202:24.80]Is that better?
[202:34.18]What do you think?
[202:34.84]Is that good?
[202:38.76]How's that look?
[202:41.68]Can you see?
[202:42.12]I think I see people right up there.
[202:55.24]Not quite.
[203:06.38]I'm in the correct position, though.
[203:07.62]I gotta get around.
[203:09.00]Let's go straight over here.
[203:09.84]Let's go this way.
[203:11.28]I'm actually gonna get the thing in the case.
[203:26.91]Ah!
[203:28.25]Got him!
[203:44.32]Get out of here.
[203:55.35]Come on.
[203:56.31]Hold on.
[203:59.04]I think it's time to leave the car.
[204:00.52]No, look around here.
[204:01.50]Oh, that's right.
[204:10.31]That's OK.
[204:10.77]I'm fine.
[204:21.52]Alright, I don't want to go that way.
[204:22.58]Let's keep turning in here.
[204:27.62]You thought I was joking around.
[204:28.55]I'm going to get to the end of this game.
[204:29.95]I'm going to get to the end of this PUBG game.
[204:31.85]I'm going to get whatever item's in there.
[204:32.89]It's going to be the best item in the game.
[204:35.57]And I'm going to beat it.
[204:36.65]I'm going to win this round.
[204:39.83]Like, I got a four-time scope and an AUG.
[204:44.04]Yeah, I'll take it.
[204:46.92]Sounds good to me.
[204:49.36]Wait, what's my x8 scope?
[204:51.04]It's on there, right?
[204:51.70]Yeah, we're good.
[204:55.33]I got the AUG, man.
[205:02.75]Wait, hold on.
[205:03.17]Let me get an energy drink.
[205:03.93]I don't have any.
[205:06.11]Let's go.
[205:14.57]I got Twitch Prime loot.
[205:16.65]I didn't sign up for Twitch Prime on this.
[205:22.82]This is a good position to be in up here.
[205:25.99]Check it.
[205:26.33]Watch this.
[205:31.87]Oh, everyone's so fucked.
[205:32.89]I have an 8x scope.
[205:33.85]Are you kidding me?
[205:35.23]It's game over for everybody.
[205:37.60]Unless you'd come on the rock.
[205:41.62]I don't see anybody.
[205:42.34]Alright, so I'm just going to sit here for a minute.
[205:56.13]I can't believe we actually gained viewers from this.
[206:00.27]Stream snipe, that's not gonna happen.
[206:03.55]Am I having fun?
[206:04.29]Yeah, this is fun.
[206:21.72]Get a fucking haircut?
[206:22.86]You get a haircut!
[206:44.49]Let's go.
[206:53.21]Pull them out.
[206:53.79]They'll hear this from a mile away.
[207:07.80]Nobody in here?
[207:09.30]Door open.
[207:09.68]Do you guys hear that?
[207:18.76]This is closing in again.
[207:29.97]I hear something.
[207:35.17]I'm right in the middle here.
[207:36.01]This is perfect.
[207:36.73]Although I don't want the car anymore.
[207:47.12]The car makes too much noise.
[207:55.56]I can't believe I'm actually just playing PUBG right now.
[208:00.92]Another two minutes.
[208:04.36]Just look for the tiny little movements.
[208:08.06]I got an eight-time scope.
[208:09.32]I got it.
[208:09.76]I'm good.
[208:11.76]I'm good to go.
[208:12.34]I thought that was a person.
[208:15.69]It's going to get real interesting here in a minute, I promise.
[208:22.71]Don't go anywhere.
[208:23.35]It's going to get real interesting.
[208:26.29]Drop it right here.
[208:29.09]And then I'm gonna be a snake in the grass and just shoot people that come over here.
[208:32.87]Oh, do it.
[208:44.94]It's down there.
[208:45.46]Remember, this is squads of four.
[208:50.38]I'm gonna have to fight four people, potentially.
[208:53.78]I'm the only one alive in my crew.
[209:05.49]I'm just gonna sit here for a second.
[209:08.25]You can see my lice?
[209:13.87]Where is he?
[209:15.61]Oh fuck, where is he?
[209:24.84]Get the fuck out of here!
[209:38.82]He's knocked out though.
[209:39.76]His buddies are around.
[209:44.92]Keep an eye out for me.
[209:47.25]Keep an eye out.
[209:49.37]This could get real hairy for me here.
[210:07.40]Got one minute.
[210:09.68]Just about.
[210:10.11]Where did he die?
[210:15.57]Where is this guy?
[210:18.13]I can feel the lights.
[210:18.97]He just like said that.
[210:19.97]Now I can feel them.
[210:26.76]He's going to bleed out, right?
[210:27.66]That's how this game works.
[210:30.56]I know that.
[210:34.20]Still right in the middle.
[210:34.92]I got to get over there.
[210:39.39]I can feel the lice in my hair.
[210:47.79]I can feel it.
[210:48.39]Like, who told you that?
[210:53.80]He's dead.
[210:54.36]Six kills.
[210:57.50]Alright, easy now.
[210:58.44]I'm talking about the house in here has potential for somebody.
[211:03.62]This is one of the last areas people are going to be.
[211:08.63]Car.
[211:10.21]Anybody in that car?
[211:11.77]Nope, here it comes.
[211:14.63]I gotta get in a better spot than this if I have any chance of winning.
[211:24.58]By the way, where are these bots you guys are talking about here?
[211:30.24]Oh, these people have been named?
[211:35.49]Make sure you guys get a good view of this.
[211:39.49]Right there.
[211:39.93]I'm going to get collapsed on here by a squad of four.
[211:44.66]Sweaty hands.
[211:45.24]Get it off.
[211:53.96]I'm still doing it.
[211:54.58]Dude, I'm going to win.
[211:55.56]I'm going to win the game.
[212:04.08]That door is open.
[212:07.40]Fuck.
[212:08.72]I'm gonna get... Just run.
[212:12.45]Watch for the stragglers.
[212:16.59]I've got weapon advantage.
[212:19.67]Just hope there's nobody behind me.
[212:30.00]So, you guys enjoying the stream?
[212:32.92]Make sure to follow.
[212:36.10]I do this every Thursday night.
[212:40.37]I hurt my back and play on an iPad that no one...
[213:12.13]You see him?
[213:14.65]Right in the head.
[213:15.75]I got him right in the fucking head.
[213:20.55]He's bandaging.
[213:24.05]Right in the fucking head.
[213:26.29]I hear somebody right next to me.
[213:35.45]I'll get you beat.
[213:36.21]I'll get you fucking beat.
[213:38.01]So good.
[213:45.12]I gotta move now.
[213:57.33]Don't get picked off here.
[213:59.91]Only ten people left.
[214:02.09]And I'm one of them.
[214:08.08]Nine.
[214:09.38]They're all in this house.
[214:10.00]Alright, slow it down.
[214:12.64]There's gonna be like three dudes just like clambering inside of this house.
[214:15.24]Let's crouch down here.
[214:25.26]Seven people left.
[214:27.94]Let's be like a tree person for a little bit.
[214:36.58]Got two minutes.
[214:39.06]Watch that flank.
[214:41.54]Could be anybody.
[214:42.62]Anywhere.
[214:42.98]At any moment here.
[214:44.54]This is the final six.
[214:50.58]By the way, just killed somebody else.
[214:52.32]I didn't even know what I just did.
[214:53.50]Just got another kill.
[214:54.23]Five people left.
[215:00.73]Fucking guy in that house.
[215:01.73]Guarantee it.
[215:10.56]I wish I had like a smoke grenade or something here.
[215:29.79]Easy.
[215:30.09]I wanna get this fucking headphone out of my ear.
[215:51.44]I can smell them, man.
[215:52.62]They're right in here somewhere.
[215:55.46]Look at this open fucking door.
[216:00.90]Where you at?
[216:11.38]There he is.
[216:23.73]Can't see him, though.
[216:24.45]I gotta get a good spot.
[216:30.69]Where the fuck is this dude?
[216:31.51]There's a guy in a car over there.
[216:36.80]Where's he going?
[216:37.20]Up there?
[216:37.58]Okay.
[216:41.60]Where's this fucking guy shooting from?
[217:00.66]One guy's up in that building over there.
[217:05.04]He's up there.
[217:07.34]It's gonna get interesting.
[217:09.34]Three people left.
[217:10.04]There's a dude, like, right here somewhere.
[217:16.41]I don't know if he's lying down or what, but I gotta move.
[217:22.41]Man, I'm actually, I'm alright here.
[217:23.37]I'm okay right here.
[217:27.30]I see movement.
[217:27.92]I'm getting, I'm fucking locking in.
[217:42.79]It's getting fucking tense here, guys.
[217:44.03]The fuck is this dude?
[217:56.44]We're all doing the same shit.
[218:01.01]There he is.
[218:03.47]He's right there.
[218:13.40]He didn't know where I am.
[218:21.63]Knocked him down.
[218:23.83]And I got his fucking friend.
[218:25.65]It's just me and one guy left.
[218:27.67]One guy.
[218:29.95]Where is he?
[218:32.57]Wait, he can revive his friend.
[218:37.61]I gotta get over there now.
[218:38.45]Go.
[219:18.65]So what were we doing?
[219:20.29]We had a mission we were just on.
[219:25.46]Something about finding KGB agents or something.
[219:33.43]Oh, distract-o-meter, that's right.
[219:49.52]I can't now, alright, but all the people that just showed up now, I'll see you later.
[219:54.27]It was fun having you here.
[220:05.76]Die!
[220:06.06]Die!
[220:06.36]Do something!
[220:08.27]The stream has peaked.
[220:10.91]It's alright.
[220:13.25]I haven't even begun to peak, okay?
[220:24.28]Almost there.
[220:34.48]This used to be a PUBG mobile stream.
[220:42.77]I thought I was going to blow that though, for real.
[220:44.21]I really did.
[220:46.74]I need... I missed that.
[220:48.76]When those two were working together up where that house was.
[220:53.14]And I missed like four times, five times in a row.
[220:55.06]That could have ended really badly.
[220:57.70]They were all bots.
[220:59.07]No, they weren't.
[220:59.53]You saw how many people were in that lobby?
[221:07.68]I'm very proud of you.
[221:11.75]Imagine if I lost to that last guy.
[221:13.53]I would have deleted my Twitch channel.
[221:22.48]Still need... Okay.
[221:29.78]Oh, by the way, PUBG Mobile is free!
[221:33.73]Not that anybody gives a shit.
[221:37.40]But I will tell you, for real, I don't even like playing those games.
[221:44.47]This thing keeps... Hold on.
[221:49.09]The last couple of nights, I've been enjoying myself.
[221:52.52]Like, the last two nights in a row, maybe.
[221:54.06]Just dumping around in PUBG Mobile for some dumb reason.
[221:58.44]Missed big money.
[221:59.10]Holy shit, did I?
[222:02.48]Oh, yeah, I did.
[222:05.71]Thank you, Lorac, again.
[222:06.91]That's more than $100 tonight, I think.
[222:09.38]It's $100 tonight.
[222:11.58]Thanks a lot, man.
[222:12.14]Nice job on the PUBG game, dude.
[222:13.50]Still a shame about that whole pinwheel snafu.
[222:15.98]But hey, you can't win them all.
[222:19.96]Yeah, you can't win every made-up thing on the internet.
[222:27.08]The stream has peaked.
[222:32.24]Oh my god, I'm gonna die if I'm not careful.
[222:35.78]We're almost there.
[222:36.38]Don't blow it now.
[222:41.52]The last few nights you've been using your iPad to enjoy yourself.
[222:43.92]Yeah, that's all it is.
[222:44.62]Blow up.
[222:49.39]That's not distracting enough.
[222:50.51]Alright, we're good.
[222:53.73]That I can do.
[222:54.99]Alright, we're good.
[223:07.34]Locked door?
[223:10.74]He lost 200 viewers after stopping.
[223:16.30]That's just PUBG.
[223:17.86]That's like Battlegrounds games, man.
[223:25.11]Take out the embassy power grid.
[223:27.05]Oh lord.
[223:27.69]This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[223:33.21]I need to... I need some ammo.
[223:38.63]Transmog, transmog, transmog.
[223:44.08]There it is.
[223:44.78]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[223:45.94]I don't want to lose this.
[223:46.66]This mission sucks.
[223:57.50]Good.
[223:59.92]Power grid is over here, it seems.
[224:04.26]Although, I can get the brains.
[224:06.01]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[224:07.33]No, no.
[224:07.85]Don't even think about it, man.
[224:08.97]Just get out of here.
[224:14.53]Those viewers were bots.
[224:16.11]Don't you dare!
[224:20.67]Ah, fuck.
[224:37.37]Alright, I'll keep it good.
[224:45.49]What a team.
[224:46.16]That was a four-person squad.
[224:49.78]I solo-queued into a four-man squad.
[224:57.36]Do I have a meteor?
[224:59.38]That'd be nice.
[225:02.34]No, I don't.
[225:03.00]Damn it.
[225:06.08]What the fuck is shooting at me over there?
[225:07.54]Same side?
[225:09.04]Or just a regular guy?
[225:10.78]No, it's a regular guy.
[225:11.88]Alright, I'm gonna poke my head up and die from something.
[225:18.48]Apparently not.
[225:22.84]Wait, can I just turn it off?
[225:27.78]I can't.
[225:32.91]Now let me get out of here.
[225:36.09]Let me be done with the mission, please.
[225:41.15]Oh, come on!
[225:42.88]No more tasks!
[225:44.10]I'm gonna get in my saucer.
[225:45.78]Okay, at least I can get out of this.
[225:49.12]Thank god I did that, otherwise I'd be shot.
[225:51.02]My lice lost me, viewers.
[226:07.80]Could you guys actually even see what I was doing?
[226:09.52]I know that was, you know, a little haphazard there.
[226:16.12]Oh my god.
[226:19.94]Kind of.
[226:24.00]Destroy buildings.
[226:28.53]We got it.
[226:28.85]That's one.
[226:37.40]And here goes the other one.
[226:41.76]Game over.
[226:44.14]That mission was really, really difficult.
[226:52.78]Oh god, I gotta land.
[226:53.57]Don't kill her with these missiles!
[226:54.89]Holy shit.
[227:03.15]This would be great on current hardware.
[227:05.11]I was saying, this would be...
[227:08.11]It's definitely been enough time.
[227:10.07]People have lost that bad taste of the last generation versions.
[227:15.73]Make an awesome destructible environment.
[227:19.05]Get like DICE to make it, or at least like ask them for their hardware.
[227:23.84]But yeah, this actually is on PS4.
[227:26.12]They upscaled it.
[227:30.06]It's not remastered.
[227:30.82]They didn't change anything.
[227:31.77]They just opened the resolution up a little bit.
[227:33.83]Coded traffic to the KGB station in Takushima tripled in the last month.
[227:38.04]I also managed to get my hands on some cargo manifests.
[227:41.42]Well, that ought to clear things up a little.
[227:45.12]So you'd think.
[227:46.10]But what sort of operation uses seven tons of visceral uranium, 340 liters of human blood, and 92 cases of spam?
[227:54.62]You've obviously never been to the Pentagon Christmas Party.
[228:00.73]Where is it?
[228:01.49]I heard about the Azusa Gamer's phone.
[228:03.71]I'm not kidding.
[228:04.25]It has RGB lighting and everything.
[228:05.95]It's a volcanic island nation in the Pacific, off the coast of China.
[228:09.79]We'll have to watch our step.
[228:12.09]Oh, EDF is incredible.
[228:12.71]EDF is like, that new one's coming out soon, right?
[228:17.49]Yeah, I found my phone.
[228:18.91]We got over that meltdown.
[228:20.17]Alert down.
[228:20.53]Seven Furotech cells.
[228:21.13]Alright, nice.
[228:21.53]Alright.
[228:21.81]I think...
[228:40.24]I think I'm going to call it there tonight.
[228:44.79]Because I... Like I said, the junk company is going to be here tomorrow early.
[228:48.09]And I have to get a lot of stuff ready to go.
[228:52.73]I have to pull... I have to get it pretty much all into my living room.
[228:57.23]And it's getting to be about 11 o'clock Eastern.
[228:59.18]Not really before I get to bed here.
[229:00.40]I need like an hour or two to do it.
[229:03.08]So... I will...
[229:07.41]See you guys, not tomorrow, uh, but Saturday.
[229:11.84]I'm gonna do another, not on, one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off.
[229:14.96]We're gonna be probably doing this for a little while.
[229:17.82]Until at least like a week or two from now.
[229:21.39]We demand a house tour.
[229:22.81]Well, maybe eventually.
[229:24.73]But, thanks everybody for sticking around.
[229:27.55]Destroy All Humans 2.
[229:30.88]Maybe not the next stream.
[229:32.48]Something else might be going on.
[229:34.76]But I do want to complete Destroy All Humans 2 eventually.
[229:37.95]Over the next couple weeks.
[229:39.49]I do still think it's a great game.
[229:40.57]I've had a lot of fun.
[229:44.27]Thanks for the PUBG stream.
[229:45.49]Yeah, you're welcome.
[229:48.00]I need to play more PUBG mobile.
[229:50.38]No, I don't.
[229:52.80]Thanks, everybody, for sticking around.
[229:54.38]Sorry for the shorter stream.
[229:57.20]But, you know, sometimes you gotta get ready to move across the country.
[230:02.27]But with that, let's go over the credits.
[230:04.47]All the new subs, all the old subs.
[230:05.65]Thanks a lot, guys.
[230:07.73]And why don't we see who they were?

[232:53.48]What do you say?
[232:54.02]I didn't even put on this thing.
[232:55.99]What an idiot.
[232:59.38]Thanks again, everybody.
[233:01.42]Let's read some bits.
[233:05.66]And hey, why don't we start off with a Styx Renegade from earlier tonight, thanks to the $1 Styx.
[233:12.84]And you say, hey, I got an idea to solve your tech issue.
[233:18.21]Invite all of us to your house and do an IRL stream.
[233:20.77]Also, butter derp and shockwave sub before the stream started.
[233:25.13]Thanks a lot, guys.
[233:26.70]Also, also, look what came in the mail.
[233:31.82]Yeah, everyone's posting their Fireman shirt.
[233:35.08]Where's mine?
[233:36.74]I ordered it the same day.
[233:38.28]How come I'm not getting it?
[233:39.88]Where's my Fireman shirt?
[233:42.73]Everyone's showing me pictures of their Fireman shirts.
[233:44.75]Would they lose mine?
[233:45.47]Yeah, if you're taking off now, goodnight.
[233:50.47]See you guys on Saturday.
[233:56.78]Yeah, I want a Fireman shirt, man.
[233:58.60]I bought it.
[234:01.08]Here's the link, by the way.
[234:03.66]You got both, though.
[234:04.40]You got the Waterman shirt, too.
[234:10.34]Fireman.
[234:12.19]But thanks a lot.
[234:13.39]Sticks.
[234:14.75]I'm looking forward to mine as well.
[234:15.83]Thank you to Eternally Gaming for the $1.
[234:18.57]Jerma, I got surgery on my you-know-what, and now I have stitches.
[234:22.59]Please give me a good stream to make me forget about how I'm bleeding down there.
[234:25.64]Damn.
[234:25.82]Damn.
[234:27.88]Well, I'm sorry to hear about, you know, surgery always sucks.
[234:31.62]But good luck.
[234:33.66]Hopefully you feel better.
[234:35.89]That does not sound like fun.
[234:39.87]I'll eat ice cream.
[234:42.73]Get better soon, man.
[234:45.49]And thank you for the dollar as well.
[234:49.31]Thank you also to Krabs for breakfast for the $1.50.
[234:51.63]Hey, Jerma, my family's in Boston right now for vacation.
[234:54.42]Do you have any suggestions on things to do or restaurants?
[234:59.34]Love you, dude.
[234:59.96]Yeah, I mean, you gotta walk the Freedom Trail.
[235:02.92]Gotta go see Paul Revere on the horse.
[235:05.65]Essentially, there's like a giant yellow brick road in Boston in like the North End.
[235:08.79]I mean, we'll go to the North End too.
[235:11.23]Go get some pizza.
[235:12.61]Some of the best pizza you've ever had.
[235:13.71]Some of the best Italian food you'll ever have is in the North End in Boston.
[235:19.93]Go look at that house.
[235:21.23]Go to the aquarium, right?
[235:22.69]Go to the Children's Museum.
[235:23.79]And I'm saying that unironically.
[235:25.35]The Boston Children's Museum is, even as an adult, one of the funnest places in the world.
[235:31.09]So, like, don't be, don't feel bad if you're like in your 20s.
[235:35.50]That place is amazing.
[235:37.30]Those of you that have been there before.
[235:38.40]And if you need to, like, do you have like a little brother or like a little cousin or something that you can, you know, oh, let's go to the Children's Museum with little Jake.
[235:46.70]But you're the one that actually wants to go.
[235:50.44]There's a lot of cool shit there.
[235:52.08]Museum of Science as well.
[235:53.42]Both of those are really cool.
[235:58.00]Yeah, I definitely... It's the man-child museum.
[236:00.98]They have this thing where you take golf balls and there's these elaborate shoots that you put the golf balls in and they go down this long rollercoaster golf ball track and there's like five of them in a room.
[236:12.61]They go crazy.
[236:13.17]It's like a... It spins around all over the place.
[236:15.21]You put the ball down.
[236:16.09]You watch it.
[236:16.71]Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.
[236:18.25]It's so cool.
[236:20.82]I don't care how... You can call me whatever you want.
[236:23.04]The Golf Ball Zoom Machine at the Museum of... The Children Museum.
[236:27.05]I almost said the Museum of Children.
[236:29.41]It's there.
[236:29.87]It's awesome.
[236:36.95]The Golf Ball Zoom Machine.
[236:38.06]You'll know it when you see it.
[236:47.17]Where's my bit badge?
[236:48.01]I donated 25 bits.
[236:50.29]I can see it.
[236:51.07]It's there.
[236:52.83]It looks like it's there.
[236:53.73]Spicy Mexican.
[236:54.93]Tattoo taco.
[236:56.57]But thanks, man.
[236:59.86]Enjoy your stay in Boston.
[237:00.84]It's a nice city.
[237:04.28]Thank you, Ray Walls, for the $1.
[237:07.32]Angry Bostonian streamer rages over $10 charge and then tells traffic he's walking here.
[237:16.29]That's bullshit.
[237:17.05]I'm sorry.
[237:17.59]Like, for me to have to, like, order shit to continue to use, like, no.
[237:23.35]Like, why can't I just... Just let me recharge the damn thing.
[237:26.87]That's false advertisement, man.
[237:31.00]Like, we and Kim got a box of them.
[237:34.52]And within three weeks, one of them didn't work anymore.
[237:39.04]And then hers died less than six months later, and now both of mine are dead.
[237:43.99]And they're guaranteed for a year.
[237:47.11]okay gave me a break but yeah when is the scuba stream I'm terrified of going down that far in the ocean I'm not afraid of sharks or anything but I'm afraid of like the oxygen tank
[238:05.80]Yes, I know that that shit has been around for a hundred years.
[238:09.46]There's been no significant technological advancement of the oxygen tank.
[238:13.84]And they work every time.
[238:14.94]But I'm just scared I'm going to go down there and it's going to be like... My oxygen tank has a fucking leak!
[238:22.55]And it's going to get up to zero and I'm going to be swimming around and freaking out and I'm not going to be able to get away.
[238:28.03]It has nothing to do with the wildlife down there.
[238:30.73]It's to do with the tank.
[238:35.41]What advancement is there to make?
[238:37.41]Expect more oxygen in the same tank?
[238:39.07]No, I know.
[238:39.75]That's what I'm saying.
[238:40.33]The oxygen tank is... They don't just, like, explode.
[238:46.51]But I have this irrational fear of it happening.
[238:54.79]I believe that's happened before, and the person it happened to was recording.
[238:58.77]Oh, God.
[239:02.05]That's insane.
[239:06.95]I only breathe mineral oxygen.
[239:12.29]Ay, ay, ay.
[239:13.56]Hey, thank you, CMD, Command Rabbit, for the $1.
[239:17.24]Jerma Alzheimer.
[239:18.84]Yeah, it happens sometimes.
[239:21.14]Asian Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[239:22.32]You know who else loses their phone and are paranoid about using their personal info on the internet?
[239:28.32]Old people.
[239:31.58]Well, no, I just talked about the iCloud.
[239:34.98]I don't know.
[239:37.03]I'm not like afraid of that.
[239:39.25]I'm just afraid of somebody seeing a close-up of like... Let me just like forget that.
[239:50.92]Close-up of my dog's face.
[239:56.76]The face from the Christmas tree?
[239:57.90]Well, that's my iPad.
[240:03.33]All the men yelling at Cloud.
[240:04.75]Sometimes.
[240:06.53]But thank you, CommandRabbit, for the $2 there.
[240:09.01]Appreciate it, dude.
[240:11.44]Thank you to AsianTurtle there.
[240:12.48]Thank you, CommandRabbit, again, for $5.
[240:15.68]Check your bed.
[240:16.42]Check the fridge.
[240:17.10]Look under the desk.
[240:17.90]Look behind the computer screen.
[240:19.02]Check the toilet.
[240:19.68]Check the toaster.
[240:20.78]If it's not anywhere here, then change Twitter password before you get fucked.
[240:26.08]I got it.
[240:27.54]Thank God.
[240:30.42]Thank you for your concern though, Command Rabbit.
[240:31.84]Appreciate it.
[240:32.34]And Command Rabbit again for a dollar.
[240:34.93]Did you check behind the computer screen?
[240:37.67]No, it was inside of a cupboard where my glassware was.
[240:44.59]But thank you.
[240:46.37]Hey, Brella.
[240:47.38]Brella, thanks for the five dollars, Brella.
[240:50.06]I'm also moving house to go study at uni.
[240:53.06]Thanks for being such a brilliant and creative streamer.
[240:55.42]Thank you.
[240:57.64]Good luck to you at university.
[241:01.97]It's an adventure.
[241:02.79]It's a journey.
[241:04.01]You'll have a lot of fun.
[241:05.19]Make sure you work hard, though.
[241:06.63]Don't work too hard.
[241:08.09]Just work hard enough where you're going to be just fine.
[241:09.95]Don't overwork yourself.
[241:12.19]You'll drive yourself crazy.
[241:12.99]It's a great time.
[241:13.63]College is awesome.
[241:18.20]But thanks a lot, Brello.
[241:19.60]Good luck.
[241:20.90]Alfred Artie.
[241:21.62]Thanks for the $5, Alfred.
[241:23.16]Hey, germs.
[241:23.52]I've been struggling a lot with depression lately because I haven't been able to land a job for a year.
[241:27.82]And I'm getting anxiety over starting college in August.
[241:32.26]But even though I've been going through some stuff, your vids and streams have always been something that could make me laugh and smile.
[241:37.41]I've been watching your stuff for a long time and it's never failed to make me happy.
[241:40.49]Thanks for everything, Jerma.
[241:41.31]Much love.
[241:43.81]Well, first of all, something you need to know.
[241:47.57]When I first read that, I've been struggling with a lot of depression because I haven't been able to get a job for a year and I'm getting anxiety over starting college.
[241:56.96]That sounds like you're still fairly young.
[242:01.10]I mean, I'm not sure what your financial situation is, but you're essentially preparing yourself to get a job.
[242:10.56]So I wouldn't really beat yourself up over the fact that you're not like you have a full time job making a bunch of money before you even start college.
[242:19.10]That's... I think you're... That's a little... You're thinking a little too... That's a little too deeply, I think, thinking about that.
[242:26.38]Don't worry about that.
[242:27.72]Now, if you need to make money to pay for college, that's another story.
[242:30.96]But if you're just concerned about not being able to get a job, you got plenty of time.
[242:37.94]So don't worry.
[242:38.48]I wouldn't worry too much about that.
[242:39.62]Because essentially, you're preparing yourself to get a job.
[242:52.88]Selling drugs?
[242:53.86]No, don't sell drugs.
[242:55.42]Don't do anything illegal.
[243:00.75]Easy money.
[243:01.29]No, don't listen to these people.
[243:03.07]Don't listen to them.
[243:04.15]Don't sell drugs.
[243:05.03]You're gonna get thrown off campus.
[243:13.25]You guys, seriously.
[243:15.13]In all caps.
[243:19.61]Okay, I shall drug now.
[243:24.16]Weed is hardly illegal.
[243:25.60]Yeah, but look, I don't want to get into like a drug talk here.
[243:31.19]I am pro-marijuana, but I don't want to get into a drug talk here.
[243:34.89]Just wait till, you know, when it gets to be completely legal, then you can make a fucking stand, like a lemonade stand for weed.
[243:46.60]I'll tell you why I'm pro-marijuana.
[243:48.64]Here's the reason why.
[243:51.35]It's very, like, not just, like, smoking weed.
[243:53.72]Like, smoking weed.
[243:55.66]Oh, dude, sick.
[243:57.06]I'm talking about, like, cannabis.
[243:58.50]Like, the actual plant is like a medicinal fountain.
[244:04.08]There are so many benefits to, like, consuming cannabis for various medical problems.
[244:11.11]It could seriously change a lot of people's perspective, you know, if you started to look into it.
[244:18.91]How do I know?
[244:21.98]Well, I have irritable bowel disease, right?
[244:27.36]You guys all know that.
[244:29.86]One of the number one things to help with that is actually cannabis.
[244:35.15]Cannabis is like one of the top things to help with IBD.
[244:40.49]That doesn't mean smoking weed.
[244:42.13]That does not mean smoking weed.
[244:44.91]If you smoke weed, I hope you enjoy it, but just be safe about it and don't do anything crazy.
[244:51.84]You do weed.
[244:52.60]We get it.
[244:57.30]Is it legal in Vegas?
[244:58.14]Yes.
[244:59.92]The marijuana laws in Nevada, it has just been legalized.
[245:06.54]So come 2019, 2020, it'll be like buying a pack of cigarettes.
[245:11.11]Although don't smoke cigarettes.
[245:17.11]But yeah, I think there's a lot...
[245:19.95]You know, there's different cases of people, like, I get bad headaches.
[245:26.49]That shit helps.
[245:28.15]You don't have to have THC.
[245:29.97]They can remove it.
[245:36.58]Just drink Walmart?
[245:38.06]Oh, drink water.
[245:38.86]THC infused Cheez-Its.
[245:48.55]No, I'm not going to advocate people to do things.
[245:53.03]I'm just saying that just the chemistry is there.
[245:59.62]And it does help a lot of people.
[246:00.94]It does help with a lot of medical issues.
[246:04.60]Now that's not me saying, dude, just like blight it up every day, all day.
[246:11.17]Just lie back in your fucking chair and just drain it.
[246:14.89]For like six or seven bones a day.
[246:25.43]But anyway.
[246:35.54]We did this before.
[246:36.52]I know it.
[246:37.18]I'm certain of it.
[246:43.87]It's a bone.
[246:46.20]A bone, right?
[246:48.80]It's a name for a joint.
[246:50.98]Joint, like bone.
[246:52.16]No, I just typed in bone joint into Google.
[246:55.25]Joint thesaurus.
[247:01.57]Joint thesaurus.
[247:02.49]Let's see.
[247:03.71]Collective, cooperative, common.
[247:05.61]That's not correct.
[247:07.00]Marijuana cigarette.
[247:09.80]Slang terms.
[247:13.58]Okay, here we go.
[247:15.50]Cannabis slang.
[247:20.48]Uh... AK-47.
[247:21.22]Alligator cigarettes.
[247:22.36]Amsterdam's finest.
[247:24.36]Anaconda.
[247:26.20]Arathi.
[247:27.05]Ass bandit.
[247:28.01]Barney.
[247:28.47]BC.
[247:29.11]Bible worksheets.
[247:31.47]Bishop.
[247:32.09]Bloop.
[247:32.57]Bob.
[247:33.19]Bob.
[247:34.27]Bobby.
[247:35.73]Boner soup.
[247:37.39]Bone.
[247:37.97]There we go.
[247:38.59]Bone.
[247:41.24]Budski.
[247:41.98]See?
[247:42.36]I told you guys.
[247:50.21]I don't know why it's called boner soup.
[247:52.94]That doesn't make any sense.
[247:53.84]Anyways, moving on from marijuana.
[247:55.08]I don't know how we got there, but... Thank you to... Frexter for the $1.
[248:08.56]Got to get some sleep.
[248:10.18]Hope you find your son.
[248:12.40]I did.
[248:13.78]Thank you so much, Frexter.
[248:14.68]Thank you, Ian Solo.
[248:17.26]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $1.
[248:18.87]I can't think of a funny LOL joke to make, but here's a dollar.
[248:21.25]Thank you.
[248:22.75]CommandRabbit, thanks for the dollar.
[248:24.41]Well, this was a fun stream.
[248:26.99]Good night, Jerma.
[248:27.75]Cheer.
[248:28.57]100.
[248:28.59]Thank you, CommandRabbit.
[248:29.89]Thanks for sticking around.
[248:30.62]You gave a very large amount of money today.
[248:33.28]Thank you, man.
[248:39.42]Lay back in your chair and slurp 15 bones of Walmart.
[248:45.90]uh thank you Jerma's phone for the one dollar I'm on the top of the dresser in your bedroom thank you Jerma's phone thank you captain worgen for the one dollar call Jerma he's prying that was true I was you were right uh thank you Jerma's phone again for the one dollar can't confirm he's telling the truth
[249:12.34]Jermis Phone again, thank you for the $1.
[249:14.04]Wait, what was the thing you wanted to take your mind off of?
[249:18.48]I don't know, something fucking weird, probably.
[249:21.45]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[249:22.75]Where is Phone?
[249:25.29]This is definitely during my meltdown here, when I was freaking out about my phone.
[249:35.07]He was so unfocused when he couldn't find his phone.
[249:37.31]I know, man.
[249:38.75]It's all I could think about.
[249:39.75]It was just the one thing in the back of my mind that I just can't delete.
[249:44.16]I told you, it's like losing a son.
[249:48.66]Where was the phone?
[249:49.28]It was in the cabinet where I keep my glassware.
[249:53.26]Like, cups.
[249:55.13]Just sitting in there, closed, for no reason.
[250:00.41]Thank you, Rewalls, for the $1.
[250:02.35]The alien sounds like a young Jack Nicholson.
[250:06.27]Shining era Jack Nicholson.
[250:07.71]Like to a T. Yes, he does.
[250:11.43]I think that was probably part of the intention of the voice actor.
[250:15.04]I would think.
[250:18.46]I would think so.
[250:21.56]But thank you, dude.
[250:22.10]Thank you, Mr. Hard to Find for the $5.
[250:24.10]Pretty relevant name.
[250:28.44]Thank you so much for the five bucks.

[250:30.04]Thanks a lot, man.
[250:31.91]Marvish McGally, thanks for the $1.
[250:33.27]I think you left your phone in your fursuit.
[250:34.79]You were trying to... That's where we're stopping on that one.
[250:43.43]Thank you.
[250:43.79]Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[250:45.44]I object to the marriage.
[250:47.28]I always wanted to say that.
[250:48.74]However, I did want to say that you inspired Odie and I to start a Let's Play channel.
[250:53.00]The first game we're playing is Sorcery 1 through 4.
[250:55.58]I'm inviting all my Toon friends over to play with me.
[250:58.67]I got Harley Quinn and Tracer coming over to my house.
[251:01.77]Not sure when I'll be posting it to YouTube, but rest assured, Garf is hard at work.
[251:06.15]Hey, hey, someone get- plug some clothes.
[251:09.94]It's so shameless.
[251:10.70]Sorry about that, but you have to excuse me.
[251:16.20]Uh, Harley Quinn's not a cartoon character.
[251:20.64]Harley Quinn's not a toon character.
[251:22.99]She's real.
[251:24.47]She's real.
[251:27.10]Hey, thank you, Jerma's phone for the $1.
[251:28.44]And he does, he's doing the bees, the vibration that... Thank you, Jerma's phone.
[251:42.37]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[251:43.65]What's all this I hear about douching with vinegar?
[251:45.53]I knew it was going to say it.
[251:46.91]I knew someone was going to say it, and I just said it, and then Sticks Renegade right after that says the same thing.
[251:52.01]And then Cool Cat says the same thing again right after that for a dollar.
[251:54.71]Thanks for the three vinegar things.
[251:56.77]And the people that weren't here, I probably just sound like such a sick fuck.
[252:00.18]Sorry about that.
[252:01.58]Hey, Couch Philanthropist, thanks for the one dollar.
[252:05.18]I know you're paranoid, but you really should turn on the Find My iPhone feature.
[252:09.14]Speaking as someone who also has a penchant to thoughtlessly put important things in stupid places.
[252:15.63]Yes, you see I could just get find my iPhone or I could spend more than a hundred dollars on a piece of plastic that after like six months doesn't do the thing that find my iPhone does for free.
[252:31.54]That sounds like pretty good, uh, pretty good advice actually.
[252:37.14]But, thank you.
[252:42.08]You're talking about tile?
[252:43.06]Yes, I'm talking about tiles.
[252:46.85]I went off on a rampage rant about Tile.
[252:50.17]Oh, this guy just absolutely ranted about this product, man.
[252:55.77]No, but seriously.
[252:58.40]Hey, good night, Brick.
[252:59.08]Thanks for sticking around.
[253:00.50]Have a good night.
[253:01.08]Have a good sleep.
[253:03.66]Eve, thanks for the $5, Eve.
[253:04.92]So I just had a really fucking funny thing happen to me when I've been sitting in my chair listening to the stream and you were talking about how angry you were about losing your phone.
[253:13.34]and I just fell the fuck asleep, and two hours later, I woke up hearing you say, you wanna know how much of a fucking idiot I am, and then you turning on your webcam, and my first thought was, wow, he found his phone really fast.
[253:26.19]Then I just looked down at my clock, and I was like, oh, for fuck's sake, it's been two hours.
[253:35.32]Alright, the funny part to me about that is the fact that you fell asleep.
[253:40.38]You know what I mean?
[253:40.97]Like,
[253:42.18]Let me tell you something about iPhones.
[253:43.92]iPhones are just stupid.
[253:45.30]I don't fucking... I hope they make a new one that doesn't allow you to... Child is a stupid fucking company.
[253:52.78]And you're just fucking dozing off.
[253:57.83]The fact that you fell asleep in the first place is, like, funny to me.
[254:01.71]Oh, he's just like... He's just like freaking out about something.
[254:04.55]Like, really not even that important.
[254:07.93]Oh, he's still going.
[254:09.29]It's been 45 minutes.
[254:10.79]I guess this is kind of good background annoyance.
[254:14.15]I'm getting like kind of tired.
[254:16.60]Hmm.
[254:18.82]And I'm out.
[254:26.54]All you hear is the Charlie Brown adult noise at that point, yeah.
[254:30.75]But thanks a lot, Eves.
[254:32.76]Hey, glad you're back with us.
[254:33.80]Thanks a lot.
[254:34.22]What is Cryptosporidium?
[254:36.82]Cryptosporidium.
[255:02.93]That's like a parasite.
[255:06.71]Causes diarrheal.
[255:10.01]It's called crypto.
[255:13.48]Well, damn.
[255:15.08]Hopefully your cat's going to be alright.
[255:17.14]That sucks for like a new kitten.
[255:18.72]Sorry to hear about that, man.
[255:22.88]That's real.
[255:23.96]Well, sorry, donkey.

[256:38.66]Yeah, that's like a living comic book.
[256:42.64]Yeah, you're onto something here, man.
[256:48.51]It's... Okay, take a look.
[256:54.07]I like that concept of the panels are like little animations.
[257:00.71]I would develop that idea.
[257:03.71]Get it on it quick.
[257:04.39]Do it now.
[257:06.25]Say out loud.
[257:07.04]Say right now out loud.
[257:08.78]Make sure you record it in your chair and send an email to yourself.
[257:11.98]Each panel is a moving image.
[257:14.94]And I patent this right now.
[257:16.66]Me, Dunkey.
[257:23.53]Pictures can't move.
[257:28.65]No, that's a cool idea, man.
[257:31.63]Moving pictures.
[257:32.14]I know.
[257:32.48]I'm talking about like films.
[257:34.74]But each panel is a moving image.
[257:36.46]That would be fucking awesome.
[257:37.26]And he's already doing it.
[257:45.94]But good luck to you, man.
[257:50.63]Do what you can.
[257:51.93]Just make sure you have fun doing it.

[258:27.44]Wait, what's going on?
[258:32.52]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[258:33.78]I mean, that's also, you know, that's a good quote too.
[258:37.70]That's from the Joker.
[258:42.70]Quitting my job tomorrow, thanks.
[258:46.26]No.
[258:51.20]Gamers, let's go.
[258:53.52]Never do it for free.
[258:56.89]But good luck to you, donkey.
[259:04.48]Let's see what else we got here.
[259:06.54]I moved a little bit.
[259:09.34]Mostly lost.
[259:10.04]Thanks for the not even $1.
[259:12.28]You got me.
[259:13.04]But it was close enough.
[259:14.10]It was literally one cent away.
[259:15.96]And I'm breaking my own rule.
[259:17.50]But I am not going to read the thing that you wrote.
[259:20.30]Because it's about putting vinegar inside of your area.
[259:25.09]So I'm not going to say it.
[259:27.35]Thank you, Hawkeye of Mine for the $1.50.
[259:29.09]Hey, Jermbo.
[259:30.63]I'm a tech repairman, and something that personally hurts me is to see a broken device.
[259:35.42]Over at You Break, I Fix, we can repair the glass on an iPad 2 or 3 model that you seem to have in about four hours, and for a highly competitive price of just $75, parts and labor included.
[259:52.15]Sounds like a pretty good deal.
[259:54.82]No, that's not an ad.
[259:55.72]That's his ad.
[259:56.78]I just read it.
[259:59.20]That's not my ad.
[259:59.90]That's his ad.
[260:00.52]He read.
[260:01.12]He read that.
[260:02.02]I just conveyed it.
[260:03.10]I thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[260:08.88]Hey, I leave for a minute and you're playing some shitty mobile Fortnite clone.
[260:12.68]10 out of 10.
[260:13.17]Great entertainer.
[260:15.01]That is not a Fortnite clone.
[260:17.35]That is PUBG.
[260:19.55]That is... You got that a little backwards...
[260:25.77]Fortnite clone.
[260:29.71]Minecraft Hunger Games clone.
[260:35.35]No, we're not gonna get, like, in a PS4 versus Xbox debate here.
[260:44.93]I mean, I mean, there really is no con- Fortnite is... Like, they're- it's on, like, TV and shit.
[260:53.66]That's what happens when you make your game free.
[260:57.12]Imagine if PUBG had just been fucking free from the start.
[261:01.27]There would be no Fortnite.
[261:06.39]Take a popular genre, polish it a little bit, make it run on anything, and make it free.
[261:12.23]Bingo.
[261:12.91]You just made the most popular video game in the entire world.
[261:21.95]What about the culling?
[261:23.57]I mean, that's like the latest topical joke, right?
[261:28.36]Minecraft wasn't free?
[261:30.32]I'm talking about, like, PUBG got really popular and then died off real hard.
[261:35.06]Because Fortnite could run on anything and was free.
[261:38.06]And had funny dances in it.
[261:45.03]PUBG had to put a price because their game doesn't run on anything.
[261:47.25]It's filthy garbage.
[261:50.89]I know nothing about these games.
[261:52.20]All I know is I just fucking... just drained it on iPad.
[261:57.86]My battery, because it takes a lot.
[262:01.62]Thank you, uh... Thank you, Darkstar.
[262:04.04]Hey, Captain Magic, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[262:06.28]Thanks for the 15 dollars here, Captain Magic.
[262:08.14]PogChamp.
[262:09.91]Oh, that's when I won the game.
[262:12.83]Yeah, I told you I was gonna do it.
[262:13.73]Remember, at some point, guys, you're gonna be the one guy.
[262:16.87]I'm very adamant about this.
[262:21.19]Why did he do that?
[262:22.09]Why?
[262:22.67]How come you said that?
[262:23.51]Why did you respond to that?
[262:25.25]One day you will be the one guy that determines what the fuck happens on the stream because you're the one guy.
[262:37.95]That's just the way it is.
[262:40.91]You too can kill bots.
[262:42.55]You saw the lobby.
[262:43.63]I don't even have to do a damn thing.
[262:45.85]I showed you the lobby.
[262:47.21]There were 88 people in that lobby.
[262:49.61]All running around, doing the thing where we lie down and punch each other.
[262:52.16]Those were players.
[262:53.50]Maybe some of them weren't players, but 88% of them were players.
[263:03.12]And it doesn't even matter if they're all bots.
[263:06.98]That game's still fucking hard.
[263:08.53]It's still a difficult game.
[263:15.95]script auto run we're not gonna do an mvm revival I would love to play mvm if they ever made any more for it if they took that dead seriously I would play that over the actual base game I love mvn just too out of date but thank you captain magic for the 15 bucks
[263:38.79]Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the follow-up.
[263:40.11]One dollar here.
[263:40.69]Hey, Jerba.
[263:41.96]Following up on the offer for an iPad 2 or 3 price quote being realistic.
[263:46.44]If you're not interested in repair, just slap some clear packaging tape on the cracks and you're just as good.
[263:52.96]That's not a bad idea.
[263:55.59]That's actually a really good idea.
[263:59.23]Then I won't have to, like, cut my finger.
[264:04.73]Thank you, Hawkeye.
[264:07.48]Someone needs to make Man vs. Machine but a standalone game.
[264:09.70]I've said that a thousand times too.
[264:13.24]I wish somebody would make an MVM.
[264:18.34]Exactly the way that it is.
[264:23.49]And make it the entire game and load it up with a bunch of cool shit.
[264:28.03]It's tower defense?
[264:29.37]No, no, no.
[264:29.85]But the different classes.
[264:32.57]And...
[264:35.14]It's killing floor.
[264:36.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[264:37.82]It's not.
[264:39.91]Those upgrade trees where you can go 25% faster, 50% faster speed, 100% faster speed.
[264:43.57]Upgrading your character's weapons to be able to shoot like 100 rockets at the same time...
[264:52.91]Those trees is what makes it, man.
[264:54.69]There's plenty of wave-based first-person shooters, but not like that where you progressively turn into this monster, this massive damage-doing machine.
[265:07.89]Killing Floor has those upgrades.
[265:11.09]So there is an upgrade in Killing Floor where my rifle will shoot like 500% faster.
[265:19.63]Or like I can get a rocket launcher that shoots and does like 700% more damage.
[265:26.22]Those personal weapon trees are what makes Man vs. Machine fun.
[265:33.44]Getting to that point where you're unstoppable is a ton of fun.
[265:38.77]Killing Float does not have that stuff.
[265:42.93]Somebody should make one.
[265:46.17]Alright, we had a lot of big bits here.
[265:49.57]About an hour ago.
[265:51.81]We'll get to them right after this one.
[265:53.33]Thank you to Voyeuristic Vol for the five bucks.
[265:56.77]I don't come here to see professional mobile gaming.
[265:58.89]Return to general incompetence for twice, sir.
[266:06.19]Thanks, dude.
[266:08.53]Thank you, Mostly Lost, for the one dollar and the... Is that a middle finger?
[266:13.64]This is a middle finger.
[266:15.16]Why are you giving me the middle finger?
[266:18.76]No, I want to copy this.
[266:29.91]Oh, it's a nose.
[266:31.69]I thought he was like, yeah, up yours.
[266:34.85]Hey, thank you, Most of the Lost.
[266:35.73]Thank you, Lorag, for the $100, man.
[266:39.41]We touched upon it already, but thank you so much.
[266:42.16]Two separate $50 bit donations, man.
[266:44.98]Really appreciate it.
[266:48.75]Thank you.
[266:51.07]Most of the loss also said for 50 bucks, get 10 kills or I'm taking these bits back.
[266:57.31]I got at least 11, right?
[267:03.40]I got like 11 or 12 kills.
[267:06.00]Yeah, I got 12.
[267:07.22]I did it.
[267:08.36]I get to keep that money.
[267:10.88]Thanks, man.
[267:12.70]Really appreciate it.
[267:14.84]GK9999, thanks for the $1.
[267:17.34]Damn it, Jeremy, you're making me actually install PUBG Mobile.
[267:22.76]Look, it takes out all the... I'm just telling you the truth for me.
[267:29.48]It's just free.
[267:32.54]You can lie in bed and just play it.
[267:35.28]It doesn't matter.
[267:37.41]It's just a fun little thing.
[267:38.83]I don't bullshit anybody.
[267:40.71]I'm not fucking talking out my ass.
[267:44.11]You just walk next to items and it just picks them up for you and just pick and puts them all.
[267:47.89]You know, there's no menu shit.
[267:51.13]You get to play against bots and look really good on stream.
[267:53.95]I'm not scamming anybody.
[268:04.06]Trust me when I say this.
[268:09.26]No, I thought, I think it's fun.
[268:10.87]I do.
[268:12.50]Only that version though.
[268:13.76]I don't like the PC version.
[268:15.60]I don't like it.
[268:18.28]I will only play PUBG with my back against a mattress.
[268:25.05]With that iPad.
[268:26.73]For like an hour.
[268:27.83]That's it.
[268:35.07]That's whack.
[268:39.86]I'm just telling the truth.
[268:41.22]That's it.
[268:42.53]I'm just speaking honestly.
[268:47.29]But thank you.
[268:48.17]Hope you enjoy it.
[268:48.87]I mean, the game's exactly what you think it is.
[268:54.48]Thank you, KXE, for the fi- I say this every time you give any money.
[269:00.90]Thank you, KXE501, for the $20.
[269:01.64]$20 bits.
[269:01.96]Do it, Jerma, win big.
[269:02.98]Thank you, KXE.
[269:11.99]Much appreciate that, man.
[269:14.28]We did win.
[269:15.60]We did win.
[269:17.06]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[269:18.58]I hope someone clipped the part where you lean back during PUBG.
[269:21.43]Your bald spot is wicked bad.
[269:24.73]I don't have a bald spot on the back of my head.
[269:27.81]There is one spot in the center of my skull back here that is a little bare because I had to get staples in the back of my head because I was playing kung fu fighters with my brother and his friend when we had a sleepover one time and he kicked me off of the pull-out couch and I hit the back of my head on the edge of a fireplace and I had to get like eight staples in the back of my head.
[269:50.46]It was insane.
[269:51.68]It's crazy.
[269:52.04]It's one of the craziest things.
[269:53.01]Prove it.
[269:53.51]How am I supposed to prove it?
[269:54.53]The staples aren't there anymore.
[269:59.28]I can't... what do you want me to prove?
[270:00.30]Like there's a scar back there.
[270:02.10]It's under a ton of hair though.
[270:03.36]I can't... I have to have a... Like a one or a two back there.
[270:07.75]Shaved.
[270:08.31]For you to see it.
[270:11.13]Yeah, I don't have a bald spot on the back.
[270:12.33]I'm losing my hair in the M part of the front of your head.
[270:15.89]I'm getting the M. I will have hair on the back and top of my head until I am dead.
[270:24.16]But I'm getting the M. It's happening.
[270:32.63]The McDonald's hairline.
[270:33.71]That's right.
[270:36.29]Widow's Peak?
[270:37.09]No.
[270:37.25]Widow's Peak is not... Widow's Peak is just how your hair grows and falls.
[270:43.25]It's like the little triangle on the top of your head.
[270:45.41]I'm talking about the M receding hairline.
[270:49.42]Bill Murray.
[270:50.00]There you go.
[270:50.38]Look up Bill Murray from Ghostbusters.
[270:52.22]I'll look like that when I'm like 50.
[270:53.28]I'll be fine, though.
[271:02.11]Thank you to HoneyChain for the $1.
[271:03.48]The new Fortnite update looks great.
[271:07.64]I hope you think that.
[271:09.36]Why do I hope you think that?
[271:11.20]I hope so, man.
[271:13.30]Thank you.
[271:15.38]Thank you, Brawluck, for the $1.
[271:16.70]What's with the napkins in the back left corner of your room?
[271:24.81]What are you talking about?
[271:32.80]Let's examine this, you'll see.
[271:34.84]So take a look, ready?
[271:36.70]So, right here, see how it's going, I got plenty of hair here, but it's going back this way, like up here.
[271:45.58]It's gonna keep going back like this, until it's essentially, it's like somebody shaved right here.
[271:52.91]I actually do need to haircut that, I'm gonna do that probably tomorrow.
[271:55.51]I look like a fucking radish from Mario 2.
[272:00.08]But anyways, wait, what do you have?
[272:01.56]Napkins?
[272:02.35]That's not napkins.
[272:05.77]That's a bag.
[272:09.71]Why is there a what?
[272:10.81]Why is there a CD on the floor?
[272:12.03]I don't know.
[272:16.34]Because my PlayStation 2 is down there.
[272:20.56]That's not a milk bag.
[272:23.42]Napkins and lotion.
[272:29.82]okay yeah I'm good it's a bag
[273:01.05]Skip leg day?
[273:02.49]No, never been to leg day.
[273:04.25]I haven't been to the gym in like fucking two and a half years.
[273:10.73]That's why there's a CD on the floor.
[273:13.61]What music are you talking about?
[273:20.61]Has this been playing the whole time?
[273:23.55]No, not the whole time, right?
[273:30.67]The whole time.
[273:34.09]No, it has not.
[273:38.25]This is the outro music.
[273:45.59]Okay, we're good.
[273:47.20]But, yeah, it's a bag.
[273:48.68]It's got a bunch of CDs in it.
[273:50.02]And now a bunch of those CDs... No, it's alright.
[273:52.90]It was just... It was Click.
[273:55.18]And... Click Dino Crisis...
[273:59.71]and uh urban chaos just fell out we're fine put it back on you want okay okay let's do the rest of the bits like this except this image is kind of alright well whatever just have fun oops it'll come back hold on you'll see it in a minute
[274:31.25]It'll be back in a minute.
[274:33.01]Thank you to Darkstar.
[274:36.81]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[274:37.99]I'm not sure if other chat members have told you about it, but there's this game coming out in a few days called Mother Gunship.
[274:44.27]It's a sequel to Tower of Guns and has a really cool gun-building mechanic.
[274:48.30]Anyways, the dev put out a call for streamers and YouTubers to send codes to, and I suggested you.
[274:54.12]If you do get to play it early, I'm sure you'll love it.
[274:58.30]I'm alright with some free shit sometimes, you know?
[275:00.68]Although, here's the thing.
[275:03.12]Almost every game you've ever seen me play on stream, I always buy.
[275:11.21]I don't think it's... I'm trying to think of a scenario where I haven't purchased the game that I've, like... Oh, hey, a dev wants you to play!
[275:19.07]I don't know.
[275:20.49]Like The Crew 2.
[275:21.39]I bought... What do you mean?
[275:22.80]You think somebody paid me to play The Crew 2?
[275:24.50]No, that was a Boston to Vegas joke stream.
[275:30.79]I'm not going to ever play The Crew 2 ever again.
[275:34.74]But I'll tell you something about PUBG Mobile.
[275:38.30]Runs on a lot of devices.
[275:39.44]It's clean.
[275:41.82]Very easy to get into.
[275:43.68]You can call up your friend and be like, Hey dude, you should join PUBG and use the referral link.
[275:49.80]PUBG.com slash Jerma985 Don't click that.
[275:54.44]It could be not real.
[275:56.19]Hold on.
[275:56.47]Don't click that.
[276:05.99]Okay, that's fine.
[276:06.69]I'm not sending anybody to a virus website.
[276:10.71]No.
[276:11.11]Don't you know that if you play video games on the internet, it always has to be paid for by somebody else?
[276:16.09]That's the rule.
[276:18.16]What game is he playing right now?
[276:20.82]Is this... Oh.
[276:22.78]Hamsters in Rebellion 2?
[276:25.88]Somebody paid him to play this.
[276:28.66]Hmm.
[276:29.68]What's this title?
[276:31.86]I've never heard of this before.
[276:33.22]This is not Fortnite.
[276:35.62]Hmm.
[276:36.50]I am suspecting some potential ne'er-dwelling here.
[276:43.60]Every video game you play, somebody had to pay for it.
[276:52.89]Potential ads.
[276:58.67]But I've accepted that.
[277:00.67]That's just the way it is.
[277:05.40]Anyways, let's keep going.
[277:09.38]Uh... Thank you, I'm Mr. Pinky for the $1.
[277:12.72]I love your streams.
[277:13.53]Fan since the TF2 days.
[277:15.43]Hey, thanks, man.
[277:16.79]It's a great game.
[277:19.89]Thanks for the doll.
[277:20.41]Appreciate it.
[277:21.57]Hey, Darkstar, this is what you said already.
[277:23.67]Thank you, Raiun.
[277:26.13]Raiun for the $1.
[277:26.99]Congrats, you won against a bot match.
[277:32.50]I should have just kept voice chat on.
[277:35.07]So you can hear the people mumbling into their microphones.
[277:37.33]Because here's the funny thing about, um, like, spy PUBG mobile.
[277:42.99]If you just have the device and you don't say the, don't allow my microphone, you hear people talking to their fucking dogs.
[277:50.36]You hear, like, people getting in arguments.
[277:52.76]Because it's just open mic, so people are just talking about their day at work and shit.
[277:59.14]It's because people don't expect.
[278:00.44]Nah, it's just an iPad.
[278:02.08]There's nothing in here.
[278:04.04]It's just a piece of glass.
[278:06.04]I can say anything.
[278:09.68]You hear like friends have entire conversations with each other.
[278:22.97]Voyeur streamer.
[278:34.08]The last person who commented was a cool person.
[278:36.98]Oh, there you go.
[278:39.08]Black Ops 3 had the same thing, open mic was enabled by default.
[278:42.56]Uh, the Plants vs. Garden Warfare was like that, it's why- I think Etalyx was even- Etalyx, were you there for that?
[278:48.09]That was me, you, Shibby, and somebody else.
[278:51.45]And he was talking- Shibby was talking about like, like, NDA fucking like, shit.
[278:56.96]And we just realized halfway through that it was complete open mic.
[279:01.59]Like, Shibby was telling, like, you know, like, going over, like, because he, like, this is back in the day when, uh, like, YouTube, right?
[279:08.29]So, we were, like, just talking about, like, stuff, and he was just broadcasting it.
[279:14.38]And he, I think, actually, at one point, he was like, oh, shit, are we, is this being broadcast?
[279:19.84]It is?
[279:20.94]Huh.
[279:22.08]Well, that's fucking dumb.
[279:23.36]And then we never played the game ever again.
[279:28.57]I've never played Garden Warfare since then.
[279:36.19]Broadcast yourself.
[279:44.68]You never would have remembered that.
[279:45.76]It's a distinct memory.
[279:49.82]Shibby's great.
[279:50.79]Here's a fun Shibby story for you guys.
[279:52.55]Shibby used to do this fun thing called, is Shibby making a video or not?
[279:59.43]It was like, after the fact, you'd always laugh, but like, so, or like, is Shibby currently streaming?
[280:05.31]So we would be like, he'd be like, hey, you want to play this game?
[280:07.55]And it's like, oh yeah, that sounds like fun.
[280:09.67]And you get in there, you're like playing Spider or something, and all of a sudden he's just like, oh, did you guys see that?
[280:13.61]And I'm like, what do you mean, you guys, you guys see that?
[280:17.40]Like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, J245, yeah, thanks, man.
[280:20.28]Yeah, that was funny.
[280:21.48]And you're just sitting there like, wait, we're recording right now?
[280:25.98]And then you do this panic where you go over the last, like, four hours of conversations, and you're like, what did we just talk about for four hours on camera?
[280:39.73]Shibby's great.
[280:40.21]I love Shibby.
[280:47.64]He's a good dude.
[280:50.06]That sounds terrifying.
[280:52.58]Why didn't you ask?
[280:53.44]I mean, sometimes he would just turn it on.
[280:56.79]We would be, like, in the middle, like, oh, nobody's recording?
[280:58.59]Alright, nobody's recording?
[280:59.55]Alright, cool.
[281:00.03]Let's just play and just chill, and we're not gonna, like, record a gameplay or anything.
[281:03.55]And then, like, halfway through, it'd be like...
[281:07.50]Wait, what was that?
[281:08.66]Oh, yeah, I know, man.
[281:09.96]Yeah, I'm playing with Etalyx and Jerma.
[281:12.58]Who are you talking to?
[281:14.05]Who are you talking to?
[281:15.19]It's been two hours.
[281:16.23]What's going on?
[281:21.11]It's paranoia.
[281:27.95]Oh, no, yeah, I can actually switch.
[281:29.21]There you go.
[281:34.63]There were a couple times where we didn't know we were being recorded until we saw the YouTube video.
[281:38.37]Yeah, that's true.
[281:38.87]I think there's like at least three or four Smite videos that we were just unaware were ever made.
[281:44.49]And again, do you have that like, do you have that kind of like gulping?
[281:48.87]Like, gulp.
[281:50.71]Oh.
[281:51.89]Hope I didn't talk about like fucking horses or something in this.
[281:54.61]Like as a joke.
[281:55.33]You know what I'm like?
[281:56.31]Obviously that's me just being lewd and fucked up.
[281:58.85]But you know what I'm saying?
[281:59.53]Like you gotta think about some of the things you've talked about.
[282:05.39]No, that's an extreme hypothetical dumb situation.
[282:10.49]That never happened.
[282:12.59]Etalyx, did that ever happen?
[282:23.14]Etalyx, you have to help me out here.
[282:24.36]I just dug myself a huge grave.
[282:28.90]Pull me out of here, man.
[282:30.24]You gotta save me from this one.
[282:32.02]Have I ever said that?
[282:34.29]No, of course he's gonna do that.
[282:41.11]You guys don't understand.
[282:43.22]You guys don't understand!
[282:45.68]No, no, no, not the just... Alright, who gave money?
[282:49.14]Oh, let's talk about money!
[282:50.24]What's this big money?
[282:51.86]Uh, thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.
[282:55.64]That was amazing.
[282:56.27]Can't wait for next week's Pub Thursday.
[282:58.15]Pub G Thursday, that's right.
[283:00.57]What is there to understand?
[283:01.59]No, it's just called, like, shock jock.
[283:04.24]Right?
[283:04.48]Like Howard Stern made a trillion dollars doing it for like 30 years.
[283:07.46]He's just like, oh, shock!
[283:10.12]I said something shocking!
[283:11.46]That's not real.
[283:12.06]That's not a real thing.
[283:22.26]No, but then I'm like putting myself in a category of being like a shock jock.
[283:29.05]Alright, hold on.
[283:30.79]Would you guys consider... Okay, if you had to describe me, like this stream, me, the videos, whatever, in like three words, would you... I hope none of you guys would say shock jock.
[283:43.86]Like four words.
[283:45.54]Reminds me of shock jock.
[283:47.30]Well, that's five.
[283:49.92]Reminds me of a shock jock.
[283:51.86]So if you had six words, I hope that's not what they are.
[284:02.50]I would just say you're a fucking weirdo.
[284:06.40]What is a shock jock?
[284:08.12]Well, it's a, okay, so it's a disk jockey.
[284:11.86]That's the person that's at the radio station playing tracks and, uh, hey guys, it's like a DJ, disk jockey.
[284:17.89]If you guys didn't know that, I bet you a lot of you guys didn't know that's what DJ stood for.
[284:23.63]Oh, he's a DJ.
[284:24.47]He's a disk jockey.
[284:26.07]So a shock jockey, shock jock is a disk jockey that is kind of, you know, he's a little crazy.
[284:34.84]He says crazy shit.
[284:39.44]I think most people do.
[284:40.66]For the four people that don't.
[284:49.41]I would describe you as an influencer.
[284:53.81]And here we go!
[284:55.01]That one guy?
[285:00.39]Yeah, you get to be the one guy today, man.

[289:33.76]That was... Never mind.
[289:38.64]That was like six fucking seven years ago.
[289:40.46]That's a long time ago.
[289:49.40]No, I'm not asking all of you guys.

[290:54.01]I'm scared to read this.
[290:54.79]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[290:57.43]Hey, mate, I was a big fan of you up until you told me you smoked weed.
[291:00.09]Look, I'm all for illegalizing it, too, but it's still illegal and I can't be friends with a criminal.
[291:05.74]I don't smoke weed.
[291:08.64]I support cannabis.
[291:10.52]God damn it.
[291:15.22]Erdemius, thanks for the $1.
[291:16.57]Jerma is a stoner.
[291:17.43]While unsubbed, I'm liked, undonated, removed from my entire brain.
[291:20.29]jermaRat.
[291:24.31]Oh, did you?
[291:25.91]Is he still here?
[291:27.73]Let's see.
[291:29.41]This was like 20 minutes ago.
[291:30.67]It was like an hour ago about... Is he still here?
[291:34.80]I wonder.
[291:36.42]Unsubbed, undonated, unfollowed, unexed, got out of here.
[291:40.60]Oh, did you look at that?
[291:45.47]He's still here.
[291:53.17]Gotta take a hit of that soup.
[291:55.07]Thanks, Erdemius.
[291:55.79]Appreciate it, man.
[291:56.49]Hey, thank you, Asian Turtle, for the $1.
[291:58.13]Also, nice paid advertisement for PUBG.
[291:59.95]I'm on to you, Jermbo.
[292:01.29]They sent you a doctored photo with your username so you could show it on stream.
[292:04.31]They knew chat was gonna question it, so they put you in a random game with real players.
[292:08.72]And you put those in quotes.
[292:09.54]You're not fooling anybody.
[292:16.42]That didn't happen.
[292:17.90]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[292:19.26]Today I learned bone is Bostonian for joint.
[292:21.22]No, it's just like a bone.

[292:42.07]Glad we finally reunited, Dad.

[292:48.92]Thank you, Jerma's phone.
[292:51.76]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $5.
[292:52.66]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say thanks for the fun stream.

[292:58.83]Everything is okay.
[293:00.17]She'll be home soon if all goes well.
[293:01.73]It's just been a bit of a stressful time is all.
[293:04.11]Take care.
[293:06.15]I'm sorry to hear that, Dr. Clay.
[293:08.30]Hopefully, it's as you say, and everything's going to be fine.
[293:15.29]Um, I wish her the best.
[293:18.33]Take care and thanks for sticking around.
[293:25.61]Hopefully everything turns out alright.

[294:23.25]Everyone who isn't in chat tunes in to sleep.
[294:26.26]Thank you.
[294:26.62]You know, I actually... Now that I think about that... These streams do go till about like 11, 12, 1 in the morning.

[295:33.20]Thank you, Snoozencopter, for the $1.
[295:36.30]I've been doing some jokes the past few donations, so on a more serious note...
[295:40.44]I know you hear it all too often how great you are, and you are.
[295:43.01]It's hard to put into words how much good you do just by being yourself.
[295:47.09]It's fun just seeing you do silly stuff, inspiring people, messing around with chat, and what's all this I hear about?
[295:52.90]You almost got me to say it.
[295:58.30]It was D with the V. D with the V. You guys know what that was.
[296:03.10]And he says, got him.
[296:03.86]Didn't get me.

[296:16.91]Thank you so much, Snoozen.
[296:20.81]Jermomeman, thanks for the one dollar.
[296:24.38]Howdy Jerma, was hoping you could wish my brother Leo a happy birthday since all I got him was a cake with doobies instead of candles.
[296:34.32]Thank you dude.
[296:34.76]Happy birthday Leo.
[296:39.92]Happy birthday Leo.
[296:42.04]Have a good one.
[296:45.43]Blow out those candles and make a wish.
[296:50.83]Couple of doobies.
[296:52.87]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[296:54.31]That guy literally paid you in bits to say that on stream.
[296:57.30]That's what advertising is.
[296:58.98]Speaking of which, check out my website, Mostly Ads, which can get you wide exposure of a fraction of the price of competitors.
[297:09.84]that I didn't advertise it I said this is not me endorsing this this is not an ad and then read his comment and then said again this is a disclaimer this is him saying this I'm just saying it out loud expecting to redirect to a furry site thank you grizzly 1620 for the one dollar watching you play PUBG mobile made me want to try it and I won my first ever try you gave me strength Jeremy here's my proof
[297:40.52]I have one, Jeremy.
[297:41.30]Look.
[297:44.14]See?
[297:45.04]Look at this.
[297:45.58]You did good.
[297:46.16]You did a good job.
[297:54.24]First match of PUBG mobile is bots only.
[297:56.76]That's fine because I had played it.
[297:58.33]I'm level 10 in PUBG right now.
[298:04.43]The first is probably bots.
[298:05.85]I'm in players.
[298:07.18]There are players around me.
[298:09.10]You see all those people in the lobby?
[298:14.86]I was level 10.
[298:15.33]Become a PUBG mobile coach.
[298:32.50]Being level 10 in PUBG Mobile is like fighting intermediate bots on League.
[298:40.31]That's fine.
[298:41.15]I'm telling you.
[298:41.89]You guys... This just goes back to the Dark Souls streams.
[298:48.29]I... You know?
[298:51.33]You know what I'm saying?
[298:54.49]You understand?
[298:54.99]You know what I mean?
[299:00.88]You get it?
[299:04.25]I'm glad you get it.
[299:05.29]You understand?
[299:05.87]Hey, thank you, KXE, for the 20 bucks.
[299:11.23]Thank you, KXE.
[299:12.91]Again, for a large donation here.
[299:16.08]Thanks for the laughs, Jerma, and congrats on the big win, my man.
[299:18.76]Thank you.
[299:21.78]When coding for PUBG Mobile, devs went to a daycare and recorded the room of screeching toddlers.
[299:28.00]That's why they behave so realistically in a lobby.
[299:34.03]Oh, Taloc's coming in with- Taloc's coming in with, like, the zinger.
[299:37.77]The real zinger.
[299:38.71]Uh, thank you, though.
[299:48.90]Thank you to Grizzly.
[299:49.68]Thank you, KXE.
[299:51.50]Thank you, Sandraker.
[299:53.04]Sandraker for the one dollar.
[299:54.46]Hey, Jerma, I just want to say I love you.
[299:55.48]Don't- Uh, hold on.
[299:58.64]Hey, Jerma, I just want to say I love you.
[300:00.16]Don't run a joke into the ground or force them to die.
[300:06.49]Wait, what?
[300:07.81]What am I reading?
[300:10.87]Oh, okay.
[300:12.49]Why am I forcing someone to die?
[300:14.29]He said, hey Jerma, I just wanted to say I love that you don't run a joke into the ground or force them to die.
[300:23.00]But that... People give me shit for doing that all the time.
[300:28.85]Anyways, the VODs of your Dark Souls streams are keeping me sane through my Benzotaper.
[300:35.15]Love ya.
[300:35.55]Have you ever played any of the Deus Ex games or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines?
[300:39.72]To answer that last question, yes.
[300:43.06]Vampire Masquerade was played on stream a few times.
[300:46.92]It was pretty fun.
[300:50.92]I don't know about Benzotaper.
[300:53.35]That sounds pretty rough.
[300:56.15]Hopefully you're doing alright.
[301:03.30]Uh, thanks for sticking around.
[301:04.56]Dark Souls is a great game.
[301:06.53]The middle portion, I, um, had an iPhone freak out in the middle of it, but as a whole, that game is very fun.
[301:13.67]I'm a fan.
[301:15.47]Uh, thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[301:16.95]Yeah, right, dude.
[301:17.67]You didn't buy Fortnite.
[301:20.47]I didn't.
[301:21.89]Actually, yes, I did.
[301:22.89]No, I didn't.
[301:23.70]I played it on PS4 in bed, and I didn't like it, so I uninstalled it.
[301:28.85]This is before they had the Battle Royale mode.
[301:30.96]I just played the Plants vs. Zombies Build Shit Minecraft mode.
[301:33.84]Then I was like, this game sucks, and I deleted it.
[301:39.24]I have never played the Battle Royale.
[301:47.69]Just that random, like, go around and pick up resources and build stuff.
[301:54.97]They don't even update that part of the game anymore?
[301:56.95]I don't know...
[302:02.78]Hey, thank you, KXE.
[302:03.64]Again, KXE, for $7.50.
[302:06.94]Also seeing, uh, as did a few Monster Hunter: World streams a while back, might I suggest Dauntless.
[302:14.41]It's a free-to-play Monster Hunter-type game that's currently in open beta.
[302:18.71]No, actually, me and Etalyx were going to play it.
[302:21.67]What stopped us?
[302:23.84]Etalyx, why didn't we play it?
[302:25.52]Something happened.
[302:26.86]It was like, oh, this sucks.
[302:27.94]What happened?
[302:28.70]Something very specific why we didn't play it.
[302:31.68]What was it?
[302:34.20]It was a 50 gigabyte download.
[302:38.76]That was it?
[302:44.73]Was there any other reason?
[302:51.69]I eat 50 gigs for breakfast, that's the size of GTA 5.
[302:55.44]So what, did we just go, ah shit, it's 50 gigs, ah, nah, forget it.
[303:00.88]Time is money and that's a long download.
[303:03.99]I think that's what happened.
[303:11.20]Hey Jerma, can you do the yeah that I requested?
[303:12.88]I waited after class.
[303:18.32]Yeah.
[303:32.85]Now you all have detention.
[303:41.15]He just did the throat singing!
[303:42.93]Oh...

[305:04.87]I could do this.
[305:05.71]I should move.
[305:06.66]I should go tomorrow.
[305:19.10]I'm gonna make a million dollars tomorrow.
[305:22.93]I'm gonna make like a hundred million dollars.
[305:24.27]This video has 11 million views.
[305:42.54]God, I'm retiring.
[305:51.49]This music is still playing, by the way.
[305:56.51]I'm going to have to listen to that whole video.
[305:58.28]That sounds fucking cool.
[306:05.00]Alright, let's go.
[306:07.23]Almost done with the bits.
[306:09.19]Getting close.
[306:10.93]Getting there.
[306:12.45]I did just delete... I deleted it.
[306:13.91]Yeah, I did.
[306:14.65]Oh, goddammit.
[306:15.13]Hold on.
[306:15.51]Come on, I deleted it.
[306:19.32]I just, like, clicked off of it.
[306:23.40]There we go.
[306:23.64]Alright, so wrapping it up, we have not very much left to do.
[306:31.93]Oh, shit.
[306:38.50]God damn it.
[306:40.64]Streamlabs, why do you have to do this to me?
[306:44.34]Why do you only keep the last like 10 minutes here after I clicked off the screen accidentally?
[306:56.55]Well, we have... That's unfortunate.
[307:07.23]I don't, I think this, I may have missed only a couple here.
[307:13.45]But anyways, uh, thank you Jerma's iPhone, Jerma's phone for $1.
[307:16.13]Daddy, I feel cheated that you don't read my bits.
[307:20.54]Like I said, I just said it right.
[307:22.18]Hey Asha, thanks for the $1.23.
[307:23.72]Mods equal butts.
[307:26.02]Hey.
[307:27.45]Hey.
[307:28.61]Thank you Grizzly for the $1.00.
[307:31.61]I'm only now realizing how pathetic it is to literally go through the effort of uploading a PUBG screenshot to show to my friends.
[307:38.27]I also accidentally made the picture public and it justifiably has several downvotes.
[307:45.69]Who's downvoting that?
[307:49.71]None of you guys better be downvoting that.
[307:53.79]Like, come on, really?
[307:58.00]Downvoting that, please.
[308:03.58]Thank you, Grizzly.
[308:05.36]Uh, thank you, Spoons, for self-defense for the $1.
[308:07.38]Hey, Jerma, here is a fun fact.
[308:09.26]Spoons used to be flat 300 years ago.
[308:12.05]The curved spoon was invented when Baron von Bonkel smacked his brother real hard in the face with a spoon.
[308:17.95]And it got bent.
[308:20.53]I don't believe that.
[308:21.67]I think that is a load of absolute horseshit.
[308:28.69]anyways thanks for the thanks for the uh the fact there's spoons for self-defense I don't think baron von bunkel isn't ever was ever a person if he was you have a username too like come on man it's not true I don't believe that baron von bunkel
[308:58.04]This is not a real person.
[309:01.20]Spoon used to be flat.
[309:08.84]No, I'm not looking this up anymore.
[309:13.39]Hey, thank you, Zephyron, for the $1.
[309:14.83]Jerm, please tell Boner Soup to stop muting me.
[309:19.41]That's between you and Mr. Soup.
[309:20.79]That has nothing to do with me.
[309:22.57]Thank you, though.
[309:22.93]Thank you.
[309:23.28]Erdemius for the $1.
[309:23.82]Oh, yeah, I'm still here, but one, yes, Homestar Runner is still around.
[309:26.90]They're making a Trogdor board game, actually, so look out for that.
[309:30.96]And two, you ever feel like limiting yourself to one anime a year might overhype that one anime, altering your expectations, and also causing you to miss out on some other good shows?
[309:41.97]P.S.
[309:42.31]Suggesting Mob Psycho 100 for 2020.
[309:43.89]I mean, I don't know.
[309:53.99]You know, it's just, you gotta give yourself time.
[309:57.99]Guys, I barely watch any TV shows.
[310:02.41]If you took a pie chart of every TV show that I currently am watching, or have watched in the last five to ten years, a big green chunk of about 68% of that is chopped.
[310:16.75]Okay?
[310:18.55]Maybe 11% of that is the news, like random news station.
[310:24.10]uh maybe 10 anime and then whatever is left on random maybe stuff that happened to be on whatever channel I happen to stay on or whatever because remember I don't have cable so my movie okay so take my TV viewing and put a movie in there as like an orange pie for like 12 percent
[310:54.63]So I barely watch.
[310:57.55]What percentage is pornography?
[311:02.51]Fucking zero.
[311:06.12]You fucking degenerates.
[311:10.72]I don't watch sports, no.
[311:15.86]Good boy.
[311:16.70]Yeah, Todd.
[311:18.42]Todd Howard gave me that one.
[311:19.78]That was a good line, Todd.
[311:23.34]who watches porn on TV.
[311:26.82]Yeah, that's weird to me, man.
[311:29.02]I don't know, sitting there like on your couch with, on TV?
[311:40.44]People who live alone?
[311:41.34]Yeah, but like you're, that's, I don't know, like having a big screen, I feel like that's weird.
[311:47.98]I feel like that's the kind of, at any moment, somebody could just come into your house, like open your door, and you're just in there in your living room, there's like a huge porn screen.
[312:06.72]No, you gotta, to, to, to, you gotta, no, I'm not even gonna give you this tip.
[312:11.64]They don't even tip!
[312:13.99]Alright, we're done.
[312:14.99]We're done.
[312:15.63]I was going to say, a bunch of fucked up shit.
[312:17.33]We're out of here.
[312:20.15]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[312:22.99]Can I have the high-pitched BR requested yesterday?
[312:29.00]That's as far as I can go, dude.
[312:30.24]Sorry.
[312:35.56]Uh, thank you, though.
[312:40.82]Hold on, let me try this.
[312:49.68]I can do this for a living.
[312:53.62]That wasn't two people.
[312:54.74]That wasn't two people!
[312:55.76]That wasn't two people!
[313:07.65]The voice of an angel.
[313:12.44]I'm just turning into a didgeridoo.
[313:14.02]Alright, thank you to Flill the Sniper, Rattatouille, Rattuna for the one dollar.
[313:20.90]This will help, it's a website, it's a Mongolia website.
[313:24.37]Does this have to be a singer?
[313:30.19]I'm just gonna do voice acting for didgeridoos.
[313:35.33]Hey Asha, thanks for the one dollar.
[313:36.60]You have to practice polyphonic singing in addition to being able to throat whistle.
[313:41.98]You know, I probably could do that.
[313:43.54]Actually, no bullshit.
[313:45.50]If I really tried, I could probably do it.
[313:49.77]Voice of an angel like I punched in the face.
[313:52.57]Hey, the doctor forever thanks for the $1.
[313:55.37]Let's give a quick shout out to Christina Applegate.
[314:01.68]Um, okay.
[314:06.72]Wait, isn't she?
[314:08.12]Hold on.
[314:14.22]What about her?
[314:20.94]Oh, that's a television show reference.
[314:23.76]Hey, and finally, thank you KXE501 for the 10 bucks.
[314:26.34]Just when Etalyx mentions Dauntless being 50 gigs, it should only be about 19 to 20.
[314:31.64]At least going by my own install.
[314:33.07]They must have added 100 monsters since you installed it.
[314:36.69]And, hey, Brolock, thanks for the $1.
[314:38.67]I think you missed one of my donations.
[314:39.99]Forgot it was my birthday.
[314:42.73]I only just realized it was Friday the 13th.
[314:45.19]I'm probably going to die.
[314:46.51]Thanks for streaming.
[314:47.19]It put me to sleep.
[314:49.47]Well, don't use that terminology.
[314:52.65]Don't end a sentence like that.
[314:58.08]Thank you, Broluck.
[314:58.98]Happy birthday.
[315:03.12]And then Spreo.

[315:13.25]Okay.
[315:15.46]You better not have linked me a fucking screamer.
[315:20.36]Facts about seagulls.
[315:24.72]Did you know that seagulls stamp on the ground to imitate the sound of rain?
[315:32.65]Fucking stupid.
[315:34.79]Alright, bye.
[315:36.19]Thank you, Spreel.
