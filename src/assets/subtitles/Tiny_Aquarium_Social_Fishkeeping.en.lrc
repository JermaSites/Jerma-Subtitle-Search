[03:09.73]Take your time, relax, and enjoy the tiny world you've started.
[03:12.85]We're glad you're here.
[03:15.78]Okay.
[03:18.44]You can breed fish?
[03:23.81]Alright.
[03:24.85]Go fishing and catch a fish.
[03:26.45]Open the social panel.
[03:27.65]Sell one fish.
[03:29.74]Let's go fishing.
[03:33.75]Okay, we're looking for a neon tetra.
[03:39.48]Income, nine an hour.
[03:40.81]Oh, wait.
[03:45.67]I have it wrong.
[03:47.92]Oh.
[03:49.28]Hello?
[03:52.06]I don't know.
[03:52.35]I don't know what just unplugged, but something did.
[03:59.49]Oh, this is like a public lobby.
[04:02.15]Okay.
[04:02.57]Well, I don't think I'm doing that just yet.
[04:10.49]Uncommon egg is $8.50.
[04:12.97]Let's get a couple more of these.
[04:22.02]New fish.
[04:23.45]Okay.
[04:24.53]Cool.
[04:24.65]Feed.
[04:25.99]Feed.
[04:28.80]Oh, it shows the indicator over their head.
[04:30.16]Okay.
[04:30.74]When they're hungry.
[04:33.59]Everybody good?
[04:34.83]How do I get a growth potion?
[04:45.38]Okay, you can sell?
[04:46.76]Fish with high fortune will generate more passive income.
[04:52.37]Is this an idle game?
[04:54.71]This is like a clicking idle game?
[05:00.68]bigger fish tend to sell for more so let me maybe sell one because this is this is selling it right I don't want to sell that I only have one of those how about sell okay
[05:26.56]So this is generating nine.
[05:28.40]This right now is generating nine coins an hour.
[05:31.49]I want to keep him.
[05:39.28]Go fishing in solo mode?
[05:42.38]Oh, I see.
[05:42.96]Play solo.
[05:46.06]Okay, you cast.
[05:47.97]Yeah.
[05:50.07]You wait.
[05:51.47]And then you reel.
[05:54.33]And you want to try to reel it in.
[05:56.94]Alright.
[06:01.66]Okay.
[06:02.86]You want to keep it?
[06:03.60]It's kind of like getting stardew.
[06:23.20]Alright, what is it?
[06:23.94]Rare.
[06:25.46]I got junk.
[06:26.16]Alright, sell it.
[06:27.78]250 bucks.
[06:28.74]Oh, alright.
[06:29.54]I'm gonna get addicted to this game.
[06:30.40]I love it.
[06:33.69]Is this Gone Fishing?
[06:36.51]Uh, that's my name.
[06:38.37]Oh, what a perfect name!
[06:46.04]Maybe you get better at fishing.
[06:53.15]Now, do my fish back home?
[06:55.27]Are they getting taken care of?
[06:56.99]What if they died?
[06:58.15]Oh, I can't cast there.
[07:05.76]Can I move over there?
[07:14.99]Ah, yeah, I want to keep that.
[07:16.34]Are you kidding me?
[07:20.10]That's got diamonds.
[07:21.24]Jewels.
[07:25.53]I can move around OK.
[07:36.96]Yeah, decoration.
[07:43.67]You can get bait too.
[07:47.81]How do I like it?
[07:48.49]I think it's I love it.
[07:50.68]I see where the where the magic comes into play here.
[08:04.31]Oh, come on, man.
[08:10.04]I still have not caught a single fish.
[08:14.56]Tano to Tem on Steam is pretty good.
[08:18.31]I mean, it is good so far.
[08:19.77]Maybe I have to get to level two before I can catch anything good.
[08:36.52]Have you ever played Dredge?
[08:38.01]I feel like I did play Dredge for like 10 minutes and I just it was like too much for my brain.
[09:01.13]Oh, I can put this in the in the thing.
[09:05.70]Should I keep it or should I sell it?
[09:08.98]When are you going to do an IRL fishing stream?
[09:18.96]I don't know if I am.
[09:21.26]I'm going to keep it.
[09:30.05]You guys say that you would watch that, but you just wouldn't.
[09:32.53]I know you wouldn't.
[09:39.30]The only people that would be here would be the, what, the 5,000 fake people, right?
[09:46.37]Because they would just have the stream open, and they wouldn't even know I was doing that.
[09:53.80]Sell it.
[09:59.13]All the people that didn't participate in the poll when we just did it, that's the only people that would be here during a fishing stream.
[10:06.86]If you didn't vote on that poll,
[10:11.04]I don't believe you.
[10:21.26]He's trolling.
[10:23.69]I mean, I kind of am.
[10:25.55]It's fun.
[10:31.32]Hey dude, does your couch recline?
[10:48.61]You tell me.
[10:53.11]That's what I'm talking about.
[11:03.07]You want me to keep going?
[11:08.26]I don't think I can go anymore.
[11:17.02]this is weird alright this feels weird to do this in front of this many people I don't know why I don't know what it's about this I don't I don't like I don't like this I don't want I don't like the idea of like slaying down while I'm I don't know something about this is feel right
[12:02.52]Alright, I just, I have one more fish and I'm out.
[12:07.86]This, actually, this is not good to, I can't, like, talk.
[12:12.71]The human body was not designed to lay down like this.
[12:18.32]I don't know, I have to sit up.
[12:27.81]Yeah, it's like, this is bad for, like, your back.
[12:30.94]to kind of lay like this you need to like totally stretch out hold on let me stretch out should I this definitely does not feel right but whatever my hair is like all fucked up too
[12:58.46]Napping stream.
[13:09.27]Hey, I'm eating.
[13:09.93]Well, that's fine.
[13:10.79]You can eat.
[13:13.41]Lower the camera.
[13:15.00]That's fine right there.
[13:19.64]Alright, let me go back.
[13:23.76]We got some new, we got some new friends.
[13:25.39]Ooh, he's huge.
[13:31.72]Oh, he's really hungry.
[13:40.17]How much does he eat?
[13:40.77]He eats so much.
[13:45.14]I got my fish decks.
[13:48.14]There's a lot of fish in the game.
[13:50.02]Oh my god.
[13:56.25]We can breed!
[13:57.45]Should we?
[13:57.71]Let's breed these two.
[14:03.49]Are they about to breed?
[14:09.42]Are you going to do it?
[14:16.41]He's so much bigger than the other ones.
[14:17.55]Okay, what about a growth thing?
[14:28.79]How much money do I have?
[14:30.25]1,200?
[14:33.72]I don't have enough.
[14:38.14]I need more fish in here.
[14:42.19]He's making eight.
[14:43.25]You're making nine.
[14:45.83]Maybe just get some more eggs.
[14:56.70]A goldfish.
[14:59.25]A molly.
[15:08.04]Where'd he go?
[15:11.01]Where'd the big one go?
[15:12.17]Oh, I was like, did he leave?
[15:14.43]Did he like jump out of the tank?
[15:21.25]Maybe I should sell it.
[15:27.24]Fish with high fortune will generate more passive income.
[15:31.36]Low fertility on this one.
[15:35.16]You should put a heart rate monitor in the corner.
[15:36.86]Actually, for a game like this, that's kind of funny because it would be like 40 beats per minute.
[15:42.99]In fact, I feel like it would get dangerous.
[15:47.00]Hold on a second.
[15:47.56]I want to do this.
[16:00.13]And you guys can like pretend that it's getting way too low, right?
[16:13.43]It's usually like red, right?
[16:58.05]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[16:58.87]I gotta do this, I gotta do this.
[17:01.14]This is gonna take me a minute because I need to do like four different text files.
[17:06.79]But it's gonna be worth it in the end, I promise.
[17:48.93]it needs to be lower?
[17:54.35]oh don't worry it will be it will get lower almost done
[18:33.02]This is going to take way too long.
[18:35.08]I just got an achievement, but it's going to be worth it.
[18:37.07]I'm going to be blinking between them.
[18:40.05]50 is too low.
[18:51.14]You're taking too long.
[18:51.92]It takes time to make a thing.
[18:56.09]Hey, just chill.
[18:56.75]Watch the fish.
[18:57.35]Oh my god, I have to feed them.
[19:06.06]I'm only making two more of these, don't worry.
[19:39.27]Alright, two more and I'll be ready.
[20:20.58]It's how it's 17 beats per minute.
[20:22.53]That's like a, it's like a starfish.
[20:38.88]Okay, here we go.
[20:41.95]I need, I need Holland in my stream deck.
[21:09.57]Okay, ready?
[21:14.48]This game is so, I'm just like way too relaxed right now.
[21:21.07]Are you guys relaxing?
[21:24.99]You're gonna lose viewers, man.
[21:26.23]It's okay.
[21:26.87]It's fine.
[21:31.90]Ice fishing just makes me, just makes me just feel so, I just like start thinking about the world and everything.
[21:40.01]You feel like you're losing it?
[21:41.78]Well, just chill, man.
[21:42.76]Just chill with the music.
[21:47.50]Hey, can you play Urge again?
[21:51.03]Yeah, I'll play it in a few minutes.
[21:54.11]Maybe like 10 minutes or something.
[21:55.81]Let me just chill for a little while.
[22:08.71]...
[22:41.15]It's the fucking music, man.
[22:43.82]The music in the background is... It's like we're all saying goodbye to me or something, right?
[22:49.11]It's like, what the fuck is this music?
[22:51.27]Alright, 10 more seconds.
[22:54.76]Everybody go back.
[22:55.54]Chill.
[22:55.96]Go back to pretending.
[22:57.52]Come on.
[23:09.42]Tch.
[23:46.31]Hey, you guys having fun on my stream?
[23:53.60]Alright, I'm done.
[23:55.02]And scene!
[24:11.53]Ooh, okay, I'm gonna sell.
[24:17.93]He's making me money though.
[24:25.70]Let's go fishing again.
[24:26.90]Wait, there are quests.
[24:28.20]Hatch a unique fish.
[24:29.89]Feed your fish a hundred times.
[24:31.93]Catch fish of rare rarity.
[24:35.87]This is a hot fish of the week.
[24:40.32]Oh, I got a growth potion.
[24:41.44]Let's use it.
[24:43.18]Who should I do it on?
[24:45.29]Oh, on the big boy for sure.
[24:49.62]Did everybody just grow?
[24:50.60]Oh, I think the whole tank does.
[24:51.78]That's cool.
[25:03.22]What did they make?
[25:08.69]What is that?
[25:11.37]They made a molly.
[25:17.34]Okay, let me go fishing.
[25:28.37]Your heart rate monitor is gone.
[25:29.45]How do we know that you're alive?
[25:31.93]Because I'm talking.
[25:33.44]Hello?
[25:41.29]Crop your camera better.
[25:42.31]How about I decide how I want my camera cropped, okay?
[26:03.85]I want to catch a rare fish.
[26:10.16]Can I go this way?
[26:11.22]Can I just, like, drive around?
[26:12.46]He's in his lazy boy era.
[26:19.87]Uh, that is half true.
[26:21.31]I feel like half the streams these days have been in couch mode, and the other half have been lava lamp room.
[26:30.95]Ooh.
[26:33.29]He...
[26:39.76]Let's do a posture check.
[26:43.19]Nah.
[26:49.70]Let's see the Katamari game.
[26:51.72]When does it release?
[26:52.24]When does it come out actually?
[26:53.10]When's the release date?
[27:03.23]Is it just unknown?
[27:06.33]October.
[27:07.03]So it's not next year.
[27:07.98]It's in a few months.
[27:11.42]Ah, that's amazing.
[27:12.76]I'll be playing that day one.
[27:17.55]I can't wait for Withering Realms.
[27:19.27]I think that's coming out this year too.
[27:29.62]What games are on the menu?
[27:31.73]Uh, this is probably the last one.
[27:33.21]We've done four?
[27:37.81]I've only been streaming for like three hours, three and a half hours.
[27:40.82]We've done a lot today.
[27:41.56]I feel like it's... It's kind of interesting.
[27:45.73]Have I really played four games?
[27:46.75]Well, I didn't really play that much of the other ones.
[27:52.76]That house slipper Q&A thing was a lot of fun though.
[27:54.86]I was really happy with that.
[27:57.23]Because I'm really not like interview man.
[27:59.47]But they were really, really easy to talk to.
[28:03.22]Oh, we sell that.
[28:07.41]I'm going to turn the game down a little.
[28:16.24]When we get the saw collab.
[28:32.42]Why are you so hyped about Withering Realms?
[28:35.00]Because Withering Rooms is one of my favorite games.
[28:37.27]It's my game of the year last year.
[28:41.46]I love that game.
[28:43.86]It's... I think enough time has gone by where doing another playthrough would be fun.
[28:48.91]But when I showed it to everybody last year, I had kind of played through it already a couple times.
[28:55.06]Or at least once or twice.
[28:58.41]But...
[28:59.64]withering rooms is game of the year last year if you don't know what I'm talking about this first time you've heard of it go look it up right now literally leave the stream get out of here leave go to the steam page for withering rooms and go look at it and go check it out get out of here why is it fun get out of here get out uh but to answer your question but I hope you didn't leave
[29:26.95]It's a combination of Clock Tower, Dark Souls, and Resident Evil.
[29:34.59]It has that sort of like original Resident Evil vibe where... Everything's kind of terrifying.
[29:40.68]And a bunch of doors can't be opened.
[29:42.94]You have to go... You have to walk around and collect keys.
[29:48.15]Well, not collect keys, but... Have to do certain things to open certain doors.
[29:51.49]There's a ton of fear in it.
[29:53.49]It's a...
[29:55.75]I would say the first like six hours of the game, if you're actually going to play Withering Rooms, give it a chance.
[30:02.54]Because the first two to three hours is a lot of... What the hell even am I playing?
[30:07.03]What the fuck is this game?
[30:08.85]And you probably will be like, this game sucks.
[30:12.16]Like, I don't get it.
[30:12.72]Like, I don't get it.
[30:13.88]This is dumb.
[30:15.46]Because it's a lot of... Initially, there's a kind of a little bit of dialog.
[30:19.93]And there's really not a lot of direction in the game.
[30:23.39]But once you kind of understand like, oh, it's just kind of a, you just have to go for it.
[30:28.30]Definitely, you got to get through the first like hour or so.
[30:31.93]I liked the first hour or two because it was just so, everything was so unknown and weird.
[30:36.39]But I know for some people that can be kind of annoying.
[30:41.54]But it is my, one of my favorite games for sure.
[30:49.06]And Withering Realms is the next game from the developer.
[30:55.63]It's not a sequel, but it is in the same world as Withering Rooms.
[31:01.92]So it's not supposed to be like, oh, Withering Rooms 2.
[31:07.99]But it looks really cool.
[31:11.06]It seems like...
[31:13.22]There's two different games going on, at least from the trailer.
[31:18.11]There's what happens during the day and what happens at night.
[31:21.25]And you play as this little ghost girl that has a weird doll that she controls.
[31:29.12]And you kind of sit on the back of the doll during the night.
[31:35.11]And that's where all the combat is.
[31:37.31]And then during the day, there's, I guess, somebody in the town that you're from that can see you.
[31:42.52]You're a ghost.
[31:43.00]At least you can see ghosts.
[31:45.09]And you do stuff during the day, like, on her shoulder.
[31:48.49]So... It's a little less combat and more... I don't know.
[31:53.50]We'll see.
[31:57.10]Somebody just said and, and, and, and, and.
[31:59.19]How many... Did I say and a lot?
[32:03.49]Time...
[32:28.27]and that's why I'm just a big fan of it.
[32:51.15]Alright, let's go back.
[32:53.29]I got money.
[32:54.63]I want to put the decorations in.
[32:56.31]Whoa, everyone's happy.
[33:00.03]That's a big boy.
[33:05.29]Yellow perch.
[33:08.65]Alright, can I breed a yellow perch with a... Oh, you're already with you.
[33:15.70]What happens there?
[33:23.11]I got another yellow perch.
[33:24.13]Should I just fill the tank with yellow perches?
[33:27.71]I love the goldfish.
[33:28.80]So cute.
[33:34.54]I'm gonna do another growth thing.
[33:38.66]Maybe I'll do a strong one.
[33:40.60]Yeah.
[33:45.27]Boom.
[33:50.65]Does it cost money to drop food?
[33:52.19]No.
[33:54.84]Alright, I gotta decorate.
[34:00.46]Oh, I can change the scale.
[34:01.46]Cool.
[34:06.09]It's got to be huge, right?
[34:14.04]Is that all I had for decorations?
[34:18.11]I guess so.
[34:18.71]Okay.
[34:24.78]What's the most underrated and overrated game of all time?
[34:30.61]It's hard to say overrated because...
[34:33.56]I feel like that could be so many things for so many people.
[34:44.98]But for me personally, the most underrated game of all time.
[34:53.47]I'm going to have to go with Withering Rooms.
[35:01.12]I'm going to have to go with Withering Rooms.
[35:04.31]Somebody just said sorcery.
[35:05.61]I think sorcery was really, really popular.
[35:11.63]Back in the 70s when it was a game book.
[35:16.78]Withering Rooms was pretty popular, too.
[35:18.22]A lot of people like it.
[35:19.47]But I would say I think Withering Rooms should have, like... You know when you go to a Steam store page and you look at the... Oh, how many positive versus very positive?
[35:30.09]How many people?
[35:31.27]To me, that game should have, like, 10,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews.
[35:36.64]Everyone should be, like, playing it.
[35:37.86]Like, I've tried it.
[35:42.28]I think it's an under, not necessarily underappreciated gem, but I kind of do think that.
[35:54.55]It takes a little getting used to, but you'll get it.
[35:56.52]You'll get it as to why I think it's so good after you've played it for like getting into like Act 2 and stuff.
[36:02.76]It's just really weird and creepy.
[36:04.33]The vibes are crazy.
[36:08.82]Are you invested in this company?
[36:11.37]Um, it's one guy, by the way.
[36:14.91]One guy.
[36:21.64]Alright, you and the goldfish go for it.
[36:28.71]Soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a long time.
[36:31.20]It's a great soundtrack.
[36:35.38]And we're gonna have a Withering Realms launch party the day that it- the second that it goes live.
[36:46.75]Okay, time to sell some fishes here.
[36:51.52]I guess I- some- who's not generating money?
[36:55.92]Oh, but I like the goldfish.
[37:01.86]Is it Withering Realms or Withering Rooms?
[37:04.23]Withering Rooms is the one that's out right now.
[37:08.35]Came out last year.
[37:10.16]Withering Realms is the one that is coming out later this year.
[37:16.27]Withering Rooms has been out for like a year.
[37:22.58]Do I have to sell?
[37:23.68]What if I get another goldfish?
[37:27.16]Wait, don't goldfish grow huge depending on the, you know, if they're out in the wild?
[37:32.78]Can't wild goldfish be like big chonkers?
[37:44.14]Alright, I'm going to fill the tank.
[37:45.04]Let's get some more common eggs.
[37:46.70]Wait.
[37:48.84]What the fuck?
[37:50.98]I should have bought one of these.
[37:56.60]Okay.
[37:57.85]They'll generate money.
[37:58.79]I'll go make money from fishing.
[38:06.60]What'd I get?
[38:09.27]Okay, I got another goldfish.
[38:10.15]That's fine.
[38:14.64]You're not going to escape the Reddit allegations?
[38:16.86]That I use Reddit?
[38:17.94]Or that I've looked at it?
[38:18.92]What do you mean?
[38:29.41]He said chonkers, he's 40 chat.
[38:34.64]Again, this is a Lububu Dubai chocolate situation.
[38:39.28]Everybody in this chat was calling things chonkers and like chunguses five to seven years ago.
[38:46.87]And now all of a sudden we have to call everything like Lububus or like Dubai chocolates.
[39:00.44]This guy hates libubus.
[39:07.81]I don't hate.
[39:09.07]I don't hate it.
[39:12.28]I don't.
[39:21.75]It's fine.
[39:28.43]Libubu destruction stream?
[39:33.38]I'm not, no, what?
[39:43.46]I feel like that's like, that's annoying too.
[39:46.68]Not that, I don't think, wait, I don't think the boo-boos are annoying.
[39:49.43]I'm just saying, I think that that's being like annoying.
[39:51.87]Ooh, pebbles.
[40:11.22]His hatred swells.
[40:12.38]No, I don't.
[40:13.28]If you like collecting stuff, there's a collecting thing.
[40:19.18]I get it.
[40:21.25]I like collecting stuff.
[40:38.09]You're collecting dust right now.
[40:41.89]Okay, if I laid still for a week, but I had machines hooked up to me to be able to like... I'm trying to think, okay, like, how do people stream like 24-hour streams?
[41:05.74]I don't, I like could, I don't think I could ever do it.
[41:09.79]I feel like I would be going to the bathroom too much.
[41:11.71]I feel like I would be... I don't know.
[41:14.80]Well, well... Because I think in theory, me sitting here like this and not moving and not doing anything.
[41:24.49]I feel like I'd want to have like a thing I could pee into.
[41:27.71]Like be hooked up to like a pee machine.
[41:32.22]Like, I don't know.
[41:32.92]I feel like I don't... I'd better get up too much or like a food machine.
[41:38.71]Where there was like a thing right there that kind of came over and it was just like... I had like a bunch of food ready on it.
[41:50.61]A pee machine?
[41:51.45]I don't know, just like a thing to... I feel like I would... Why couldn't I get up there in a 24-hour stream?
[42:03.35]I'm talking about like there's no way to just lay here for 24 hours, right?
[42:09.45]I guess maybe they could be, but not really.
[42:12.00]Like you have to go to the bathroom.
[42:23.68]You're allowed to get up though.
[42:25.31]Yeah, why am I putting this weird rule on a 24 hour stream in my brain?
[42:29.65]Where you it's 24 straight hours in the chair.
[42:33.90]Why am I like saying that?
[42:35.60]I don't know why that's I'm putting those two together.
[42:45.37]Like why can't you just get up and go get a snack?
[42:47.81]Why do you have to be like fed in the chair?
[42:51.42]And like not stopping playing games.
[43:04.37]We're going to gloss over the pee machine like that?
[43:07.85]No, I'm saying like to do an actual 24 straight hours.
[43:12.54]I don't get up.
[43:13.62]I'm going to be here.
[43:14.32]I'm going to be gaming for a full day.
[43:17.08]Right?
[43:19.65]You'd have to pee into something.
[43:30.00]I'm hooked up and I got my pee machine.
[43:31.96]I've got my poop machine.
[43:34.46]And I've got my food delivery tube right above me.
[43:37.14]Above me right here, as you see.
[43:38.95]The big tube is going to be dropping, and it's going to be like some kind of a sponsor.
[43:42.97]It's going to be like sponsored food.
[44:00.08]And we're going to see...
[44:02.37]How many levels I can get in World of Warcraft?
[44:12.04]24 hours of... Wouldn't that mean you'd have to shit on stream too?
[44:23.07]Yeah, because how would you prove that you didn't get up?
[44:25.65]Like the challenge of, I don't get up at all and I'm going to be in the chair.
[44:45.38]This is a South Park episode?
[44:47.29]I feel like they touched upon it.
[44:54.82]Hey, can we stop talking about your fantasies?
[45:04.86]I'm saying all this to tell you that there's...
[45:07.84]If I ever announce that I'm doing a 24-hour stream, assume something is wrong.
[45:14.60]Like, something very wrong.
[45:17.53]Assume something has gone wrong.
[45:20.01]Because I could never do it, ever.
[45:22.36]Ooh.
[45:23.36]Keep it.
[45:32.75]Like if one day over the next year or so, you hear me say, guys, I got a big announcement.
[45:38.68]We're doing a 48 hour nonstop stream.
[45:43.46]You should be concerned about it because that guy would never do that.
[45:46.79]That should be the time for you to go, what the fuck's going on?
[45:56.58]You already said that about Fortnite and then you did that tournament.
[46:01.61]wait I said if you see me play Fortnite on stream assume something has gone wrong I said that I didn't I would never have made a blanket statement like that on Fortnite do I hate Fortnite I don't think I hate Fortnite assume we had to assume something was wrong
[46:34.84]doing that right now yes because I'm so confident that I would never ever personally do a 48 hour stream there's no way that would I would never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever do it ever guys I've done a 14 hour stream and I was like I'm never doing that ever again imagine adding 10 hours on top of that
[47:04.69]And hey, to the people that can do that, I wish I had your strength.
[47:09.65]I wish I had your... God, to be young again.
[47:12.75]God, to be young again.
[47:26.47]Stop being such a baby?
[47:27.53]Why?
[47:27.71]Because I don't want to do a 48-hour stream?
[47:33.09]What about 23 hours?
[47:38.45]Stream in shifts with the horsemen.
[47:40.90]Okay, I get that.
[47:41.50]I understand that part.
[47:42.56]I get that part.
[47:43.88]But... Okay, if I stream for seven or eight hours, and then like Vinny did, and then Ster did, and then like whoever, right?
[47:52.11]I understand that part.
[47:53.72]But... I can't sleep on stream.
[47:57.84]The like, you are on 24 hours, and you only kind of get up to go to the bathroom and like refresh yourself and, you know...
[48:06.96]No, no, I would never dream myself sleeping.
[48:16.09]I could not, ever.
[48:20.50]Unless it was a joke that I was specifically doing for that reason.
[48:28.45]Boohoo, I don't want to work a 24-hour day.
[48:30.41]Grow up, you baby!
[48:34.38]it's not even it's okay it's it's just the you sleep naked I don't sleep naked I just don't want to be I don't want to be filmed sleeping I don't want that
[49:02.68]What about dollhouse?
[49:03.56]Yeah, but that was like fake sleeping.
[49:07.96]I'm talking about it.
[49:09.43]It's 1130 at night.
[49:10.67]Okay, guys.
[49:12.67]Good night.
[49:13.95]And then I get on like the covers and you're just here.
[49:16.03]I don't... I can't personally do that.
[49:17.72]I can't do it.
[49:27.15]Are you afraid of doing something weird?
[49:29.87]No, I just don't... I don't... Okay.
[49:33.04]Think about this.
[49:34.70]You think about it for a second.
[49:36.92]If people are just like... I think he farted.
[49:44.99]Well, he moved.
[49:46.39]What do his legs look like?
[49:47.31]Let me look at his legs.
[49:50.12]Oh, I can see up his nose now.
[49:53.44]And there's like 10,000 of you doing that.
[49:55.73]While you are sleeping.
[50:01.31]I don't want any... I don't want that.
[50:12.27]Well, maybe it would be nice.
[50:13.57]I know.
[50:21.88]I can see a ball peeking out.
[50:25.19]You just explained something that I imagining me laying down and four or five hours have gone by.
[50:33.40]I'm in REM sleep right now.
[50:35.29]I'm in REM sleep.
[50:37.68]And I'm just, I just decide to like, just, I don't know, like pull my pants and underwear down.
[50:44.09]And like, I don't know, like just like shift and move.
[50:46.98]Like I'm not fucking doing that.
[50:49.82]I'm not doing that.
[50:55.07]What is the over-under of me doing that?
[50:57.78]It's very low because I don't really do that.
[50:59.80]But I have done that before.
[51:02.20]I've, like, woken up and, like, been half asleep and been like, oh, my pants.
[51:06.77]My pajamas are up.
[51:08.95]I, like, pull my pants and underwear and, like, fix it.
[51:12.38]I'm not doing that on camera.
[51:25.44]That's an interesting fear.
[51:31.67]Ah, what an interesting fear.
[51:33.29]I don't want people watching me while I sleep.
[51:36.91]I think if you were in Fawn Family Feud, that would be not even a- that would be a non-answer.
[51:46.38]People have nightmares about, like, the man in the room, like, the scary shadowy man that, like, fucking is in the corner and it's like a monster staring at you.
[51:57.15]What are you talking about?
[51:57.97]That's a real fear.
[52:01.05]Ooh.
[52:06.72]Yeah, the hat man.
[52:10.96]Yeah, let me lay down and have 10,000 hat mans watch me while I sleep.
[52:27.76]You would be the hat man.
[52:35.22]Get in a sleeping bag, then?
[52:38.40]That doesn't fix the problem!
[52:47.03]Wait, you're saying to get in a sleeping bag, and like... Like, oh, zip!
[52:51.39]I'm in my sleeping bag!
[52:52.50]No, at that point, my body and brain would be... It would be... No, I'm not... I would never do it.
[53:01.77]Hire a body double to sleep for you?
[53:03.77]That's actually kind of funny.
[53:07.06]Alright, I'm going to go back to the aquarium.
[53:11.37]Oh, shit.
[53:16.37]Sorry, I was fishing for a long time.
[53:19.22]They're huge.
[53:19.80]Look at how big they are.
[53:23.04]Oh, yeah, we're going to breed.
[53:25.20]Let's breed.
[53:25.86]How many do I need to breed?
[53:29.33]Because look at how big and strong this one is.
[53:32.53]Who should I breed this one with?
[53:37.39]Don't say it like that.
[53:39.37]Okay.
[53:39.83]I'm just saying, like, I'm excited that I have a large fish to be able to breed a... It's in the game.
[53:47.32]It literally says it right there.
[54:00.04]A yellow bass.
[54:01.10]Cool.
[54:13.97]No, I don't want people like, oh, what about a sleeping bag?
[54:16.29]Why don't you just sleep in like a big jumpsuit or something?
[54:19.80]No, I don't want... Okay, if you're imagining like a camera that's set up where I lay down and the camera is only like focused on one section of my head of just... No, I don't want that.
[54:34.76]I don't like the concept in general.
[54:38.81]Sleep under the bed.
[54:42.83]In fact, that would be weirder.
[54:44.15]I feel like you'd be looking at... I don't know.
[54:46.39]I feel like doing a... I don't know.
[54:49.08]That's weird to me.
[54:52.42]A bunch of people leaning in and looking at my sleeping face.
[54:58.67]How many do I have in here?
[54:59.75]Okay, I'm going to buy another growth potion.
[55:03.52]And then I'm going to save for better eggs.
[55:10.10]What about that one pic of you sleeping on the mattress?
[55:23.89]Yeah, but that's funny though.
[55:24.87]That's funny as a picture.
[55:28.52]I'm okay with a with a photo of me sleeping in like a goo but it's a it's a goofy photo and you don't even know if that photo if you don't even know if the the legitimacy of that photo you don't know where that came from you have no idea where that photo is from how do you know because you were naked in it it doesn't matter
[56:03.98]You told us it was hamburger helper.
[56:05.90]Yeah.
[56:09.17]Do you sleep?
[56:09.71]I don't.
[56:10.27]Okay.
[56:10.77]This is the final sleep related question before we move on.
[56:16.18]I sleep.
[56:20.24]I sleep like I'm about to go play like a like a pickup game of basketball without the shoes.
[56:28.16]It's usually like basketball shorts and like a tank top or maybe shirtless.
[56:40.72]So shorts.
[56:46.28]I don't know why I had to like run around in a circle explaining what sleeping with shorts on is.
[56:55.40]How do you sleep?
[56:56.40]Well, you say I sleep as if I'm playing a pickup game of basketball without wearing the shoes though And sometimes I don't have the shirt on So shirtless with with shorts.
[57:05.75]Yes.
[57:07.23]Okay, good to know You're the king of dilly-dallying?
[57:12.77]I know, I know, I'm aware I want to get a rare fish.
[57:20.48]I need level four
[57:28.54]Is the tank full?
[57:44.80]What's your default outfit?
[57:45.88]Like a cartoon character wearing the same thing?
[57:49.70]My go-to is usually... A pair of comfortable pants.
[57:54.35]Like gym pants.
[57:56.25]Stuff you would... Like, you know...
[57:59.13]Uh, how do I even describe the material?
[58:02.92]It's like that comfortable, like, I don't know, polyester?
[58:06.62]Like, what is it?
[58:08.00]Like, like gym pants.
[58:09.26]Like, just kind of hangout pants.
[58:11.55]What would you even call them?
[58:16.55]They're not really sweatpants.
[58:17.81]Yeah, like, more like joggers.
[58:18.90]Yeah.
[58:19.68]Like jogging pants.
[58:21.32]Tracksuit pants.
[58:22.08]Yep.
[58:22.46]That's, that's a good way to put it.
[58:27.67]Yeah, I like not basketball pants.
[58:31.65]And then I typically have just like a solid color shirt.
[58:36.22]I like a gray shirt.
[58:38.22]I like just like a black shirt.
[58:39.18]Like I'm wearing right now.
[58:39.96]This is just like a black solid color tee.
[58:44.39]With like Adidas pants on or like Nike or whatever.
[58:48.97]But like a pair of sneakers is usually it.
[58:59.63]This shirt's painted on.

[59:09.24]I want to get one rare fish before I leave.
[59:11.04]What about player two, Jerma?
[59:23.86]Player two, me?
[59:24.98]I'm biting my lip again.
[59:26.30]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[59:38.00]A player to me.
[59:42.15]It'd be a V-neck.
[59:44.21]It'd be like a blue V-neck.
[59:46.36]And a pair of jeans.
[59:48.26]That's my like going out outfit.
[59:50.72]If I'm going out somewhere.
[59:52.59]Not just running like a random errand.
[59:54.77]Uh.
[59:57.16]But if I'm going to be, oh, I'm going to go out and we're, you know, let's do something a little more, let's call it not dressy, but not just run into like, you know, the grocery store.
[60:08.18]It's like a V-neck or a nice shirt with a pair of jeans.
[60:20.36]What do you wear to the casino?
[60:21.80]Usually that.
[60:24.21]I don't really dress up.
[60:25.15]I'm not a suit kind of guy or wearing like polos or... How are the crowds in Vegas right now?
[60:49.84]I actually haven't really been out to the, let's call it like the tourist strip area in a long time now.
[60:58.25]It's been a while.
[61:06.22]I need to get to level four.
[61:17.98]Where are the fish?
[61:23.17]finally how is Vegas for a non-tourist I love Vegas for the reason that the food here because it's a tourist place
[61:39.23]There is some of the best of every kind of food because there's so many kinds of people coming in from all over the world that, and the restaurant businesses are so, so competitive here because they have to be that there are some maybe not, there's some shit restaurants that I've had or been to or heard of.
[62:00.56]But for the most part, a lot of the food here is always like a solid four out of five, at least like a eight or nine or 10 for every place.
[62:08.97]Because they kind of have to be.
[62:15.17]It's very rare that you'll pick a place here and go, oh, let me try that place.
[62:19.54]It's got decent reviews.
[62:20.64]And you go there and it's like, this is fucking disgusting.
[62:24.26]It's usually pretty good.
[62:25.10]Everything.
[62:29.09]What is it?
[62:29.63]What is it?
[62:29.95]106 here right now?
[62:31.23]Yeah, it's hot.
[62:31.69]It's been hot.
[62:36.49]One of the reasons why I'm on the couch right now is because in the lava lamp room, it just, it just gets so hot in there.
[62:45.08]To a point where it's just, ugh, I feel like steam is coming out of my neck like a fucking Looney Tunes character.
[62:55.17]Okay, so no more, go back.
[63:02.78]A hundred!
[63:06.21]Oh, they all got money on them.
[63:12.03]Alright, I'm gonna sell some fishes.
[63:14.54]Oh, open the social panel.
[63:15.76]What does that do?
[63:18.70]You've received a thousand coins.
[63:20.47]Ooh, shit.
[63:25.25]Should I start inviting, like... Hey, Vinny, do you want to play the aquarium game?
[63:44.56]Okay, let's make some sales.
[64:08.42]Okay.
[64:08.54]I wanted... Ooh.
[64:11.64]Ooh.
[64:14.13]This is two different eggs.
[64:15.41]Alright, this is an ocean egg.
[64:19.16]What we got?
[64:20.36]Come on, something.
[64:21.04]Something big.
[64:24.66]Actually... Ooh, an epic seahorse.
[64:31.23]That's kind of cool.
[64:35.59]I like this game.
[64:36.44]This game's cute.
[64:37.16]It's very chill.
[64:38.40]I like it.
[64:40.48]How do you feel about beaches?
[64:41.28]I love them so much and I miss them dearly.
[64:45.57]New England had so many nice beaches.
[64:47.75]I love the beach.
[64:55.22]OK, now I need enough money.
[64:59.67]This thing is gigantic.
[65:08.54]Landlocked, yeah.
[65:12.10]Vegas has a lot of great stuff, but it is landlocked.
[65:17.22]And I mean, there are pools and water parks and but it's just not the same.
[65:23.13]It is not even close to being out on the water.
[65:25.41]The real like Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean.
[65:31.97]I could lay down on the beach and just lay out there until you literally took a spatula and had to like scoop me up off the sand.
[65:43.40]I love it so much.
[65:49.17]He yearns for the sea.
[65:53.43]Yeah, I love like just the ocean.
[65:57.02]I'm not even a big, like, oh, I love to go diving or I love swimming.
[66:01.68]I just love that.
[66:03.75]I'm sitting on a, in a lawn chair.
[66:06.99]It's like a ice cold beer or a soda or a Coca-Cola or something.
[66:11.94]And there's a, there's a sandy, dirty ass ham and cheese with sand all over it and like a little cooler next to me.
[66:19.33]And just sitting and just listening to that, the singing ocean of the waves and just letting the sun cook the fuck out of you.
[66:28.11]Ugh.
[66:31.02]man and the and the sandwiches are always smushed in saran wrap they're always crushed and up and disgusting looking and you undo the saran wrap ah what a good day what's the matter I think he must have like he's hungry and he wants to go out is that what you want to do yeah
[66:59.37]Okay.
[67:00.25]I think he wants to go outside.
[67:02.41]I'm probably going to call it here.
[67:03.26]I just wanted to do like a morning stream with the House Flipper devs and then play some stuff.
[67:08.22]I had a lot of fun though.
[67:09.20]It was some good stuff.
[67:12.01]I do want to buy an uncommon egg though before I go.
[67:16.09]850?
[67:20.54]Okay.
[67:22.26]Legendary egg?
[67:23.75]This really is an incremental game.
[67:24.93]I love it.
[67:30.84]Ooh, a hawkfish.
[67:38.55]Uncommon.
[67:39.40]So you can have up to 20.
[67:40.12]You can buy new tanks, I think, too.
[67:44.86]It's okay, Mr. Dog.
[67:47.23]He's like, get me out of here.
[67:50.17]Auto-cam next stream?
[67:51.21]Alright, there will be an auto-cam within the next two weeks.
[67:58.20]uh you know I'll be live maybe on Sunday Sunday or Monday plan for Sunday we should do a movie night that'd be kind of fun probably maybe not Sunday but I want to do public domain stuff again and infomercials and
[68:25.74]Hey, it's good when there's a lot of random stuff to do.
[68:27.84]Because it means there's always something to do.
[68:30.85]But this was Tiny Aquarium.
[68:32.23]I actually really like this.
[68:33.35]I'm going to probably play it more.
[68:36.42]Maybe not on stream, but I definitely will play it off stream.
[68:41.51]And maybe you'll see it again.
[68:42.31]I don't know.
[68:44.99]But yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[68:46.31]Thanks for hanging out.
