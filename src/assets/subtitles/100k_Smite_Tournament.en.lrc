[00:36.02]How do I see my abilities?
[00:37.01]Okay.
[00:37.27]Got it.
[00:38.07]Press K to read them or just add the F keys.
[00:40.33]F1, F2, F3.
[00:44.38]Alright, guys.
[00:45.14]Hi, it's me, Jerma985.
[00:47.22]Welcome.
[00:48.07]I told you about this Smite tournament that I'm in.
[00:49.75]I'm going to give you just a very quick rundown of what's going to happen here.
[00:53.87]So everybody in chat can yell at the other people that come into chat in like 10 minutes, yelling at me as to why I have not like crashed a car and laughed about it like we did a couple nights ago.
[01:04.79]This is a very important tournament.
[01:06.19]This is a $100,000 Smite tournament.
[01:08.73]Mizkif is hosting it.
[01:10.58]I'm taking this pretty seriously.
[01:11.82]I'm going to try as best I can.
[01:13.58]No cam.
[01:14.58]I'm going to call.
[01:15.54]I've got my team here.
[01:16.34]I'm a team captain.
[01:17.98]He's doing his team fortune.
[01:18.86]Yeah, I'm doing my TF2 voice because I have to be able to talk and tell people where I am.
[01:24.34]And yes, I'm in my underwear.
[01:25.56]I'm playing completely naked because I wasn't ready.
[01:27.26]Couldn't take a shower.
[01:28.96]It started kind of early Pacific time.
[01:31.46]So I literally have, I don't have any clothes on.
[01:35.04]So just for you to know that.
[01:37.53]Okay, um, so I'm gonna jump back in here.
[01:40.93]We have, uh, my best friend, uh, Poke.
[01:45.11]You probably saw from that tweet.
[01:47.55]Uh, he's, what is Poke playing?
[01:48.95]I guess we could just go over it in the rules.
[01:52.21]It's me, Surefour, Poke, NoCo, Russell, and our coach is Weaken.
[01:58.74]And you can, I'm sure you've probably been watching Poke's stream probably by this point.
[02:01.82]Alright, here we go.
[02:02.78]But hi, yeah, I'm gonna be serious, no cam, I'm not gonna be like, oh hey, look at me, I'm a fucking dickhead!
[02:07.53]No, this is serious gamer time right now.
[02:09.85]This is a $100,000 tournament.
[02:10.57]Alright, you guys get it?
[02:13.03]You get it.
[02:13.99]This is just my perspective.
[02:16.12]If you want to go watch the big stream, that's on Mizkif's channel.
[02:20.76]But why don't you stay here?
[02:23.06]Okay.
[02:23.82]Alright.
[02:24.58]Look at me.
[02:29.25]Ares.
[02:29.89]That's my support character.
[02:32.17]Ares, alright.

[03:01.42]I'm whatever I feel like playing in the mid lane.
[03:03.76]I don't know if no ghost found his character.
[03:09.95]A god.
[03:10.71]No, I did.
[03:11.01]I did.
[03:11.23]I did.
[03:11.63]I'm playing right now.
[03:12.61]The only thing is when I attack people, the fucking blood splatter is bigger than my forehead.
[03:16.49]So like, well, how do I get that off?
[03:18.11]Blood splatter?
[03:19.33]Hold on.
[03:19.61]Let me.
[03:19.95]Yeah.
[03:20.49]Who are you playing?
[03:21.87]I'm playing.
[03:22.25]I got banned from Hyrule's website.
[03:24.35]You got banned?
[03:25.68]Yeah.
[03:25.88]It says the owner of this website, Hi-Rez Studios, has banned you temporary from accessing this website.
[03:30.57]Wait.
[03:31.01]What did you do?
[03:31.57]Probably refreshing a little bit too much.
[03:33.97]Who are you playing Nocos with?
[03:35.61]Is it Nami?
[03:36.67]Is it Nami?
[03:37.07]Okay.
[03:37.31]Hold on one second.
[03:37.93]What does this do?
[03:39.17]It might be the skin you have on.
[03:40.29]Did you buy a skin?
[03:42.41]Did you have a skin on?
[03:43.57]Yeah.
[03:44.10]This thing.
[03:44.72]See that?
[03:46.26]No.
[03:46.40]It's crits.
[03:49.56]Hold on.
[03:49.78]Do you see it?
[03:50.66]I'm going in.
[03:51.10]I'll check.
[03:53.19]I am not gonna lie.
[03:54.05]I need drops.
[03:55.39]Yeah, I think it works now.
[03:56.45]Are drops enabled?
[03:57.99]Can anybody... Are drops actually enabled on my channel at least?
[04:02.55]Yeah, they are.
[04:03.05]Okay.
[04:03.87]Guys, drops are enabled.
[04:04.89]That would be embarrassing if they weren't.
[04:08.41]Oh, you're talking about the numbers on your screen that are huge.
[04:11.19]Yeah.
[04:12.07]Yeah.
[04:13.83]You can't change that?
[04:14.63]I don't think so now that you mention it.
[04:16.95]Let me double check.
[04:17.73]The numbers?
[04:18.35]That shit is fucking huge.
[04:20.49]Oh, try...
[04:23.30]I got it now.
[04:24.84]You can't jump?
[04:25.57]That's awkward.
[04:26.17]Yeah, you can.
[04:26.71]You can.
[04:26.95]You can.
[04:27.23]It should be... Whoa.
[04:28.95]You just can't auto and jump.
[04:30.41]Yeah.
[04:30.65]No.
[04:30.77]You can't use abilities and jump at the same time.
[04:32.83]Okay.
[04:33.03]It's combat scaling, I think, is what you want to turn down.
[04:35.25]It's under user interface.
[04:37.64]Alright.
[04:37.94]Combat scaling.
[04:38.40]Turn it away.
[04:41.14]Never have a mess of this.
[04:42.48]Yep.
[04:42.66]That's it.
[04:43.10]That'll make it way...
[04:46.32]Yeah, again, for people just coming in now, this is, again, I want to make this really clear, this is a gamer stream, I've got a team here, I'm the team captain, we've been practicing, well, we did a little bit last night, this is a $100,000 tournament, no cam, no comedy, this is not going to be a funny stream, this is going to be like we're playing the game, trying to win $100,000, okay, this is $100,000, understand?
[05:10.64]I'm not going to jump into a tower and talk about Dunkin' Donuts today.
[05:16.87]This is for $100,000.
[05:19.35]Not today.
[05:21.07]I'm being serious today.
[05:23.43]There are only 1,000 viewers?
[05:24.63]That can't be right.
[05:27.07]That actually can't be right.
[05:29.13]That can't be right.
[05:29.99]I only have 1,000 viewers right now?
[05:33.22]Whatever.
[05:34.60]It's a gamer stream.
[05:38.45]But yeah, I'm actually going to try to take it seriously.
[05:40.57]We'll have fun.
[05:41.21]Don't worry.
[05:42.79]Don't worry.
[05:44.01]Green screen stream is in like two days.
[05:45.83]Relax.
[05:49.99]Like who their better people are.
[05:52.48]You want to exploit whoever their weakest players are.
[05:55.36]That's kind of the goal.
[05:56.49]true um also like what combos well with aries anything yeah they both do both of those will be fine um Artemis like you'll do a lot for the land as aries you should clear and do a lot so Artemis will be fine and if you want to go for kills you also do a lot of damage on aries okay
[06:13.79]so let me just for my brain again speed um attack mid lane then go wherever I want make sure those three minute timers bang bang bang make sure blue is dropped for solo every time that's I've got that right right yep alright got it yeah I think I think I understand this character a lot
[06:35.57]This is like a perfect character for me.
[06:37.31]That works.
[06:37.78]Go if you can.
[06:39.24]Like close out of this.
[06:40.20]And I want you to go into a regular game just so you know where to start.
[06:42.28]Like what to do at the very beginning of the game.
[06:43.64]Do we have time?
[06:45.40]Yeah.
[06:46.48]They said 3.30 would be when we started.
[06:48.16]So it should take like one minute.
[06:51.06]Okay.
[06:51.45]So... Go ahead, sir.
[06:54.95]3.30 as in like 3.30 EST?
[06:56.87]Yeah.
[06:57.77]Okay.
[06:58.69]So I go to where?
[07:00.17]Go to... Just go to training and go to conquest.
[07:05.10]I'm not going to buy the burger skin.
[07:06.36]I don't even play with that character.
[07:08.37]Go to play and then training.
[07:09.89]It says in queue.
[07:11.93]Yeah, training.
[07:14.73]And then conquest and then do easy bots.
[07:16.24]Just the first one and quick play.
[07:19.66]It'll start the game up.
[07:21.06]These skins are fucking sick.
[07:23.58]Guys, I'm going to tell you, I'm just going to be really realistic here.
[07:26.52]People, will we win the Smite tournament?
[07:29.66]I think at least one or two people have just installed the game an hour ago on the team.
[07:33.89]I don't, I don't think we're going to get to the end.
[07:35.99]We'll do, we'll probably be okay.
[07:39.03]We'll probably do alright.
[07:43.71]I can't buy the cheeseburger skin.
[07:45.25]I don't play with the cheeseburger character.
[07:52.59]I believe.
[07:54.41]I believe.
[07:55.03]What did you say?
[07:58.08]Retirement stream?
[07:59.08]Wait, what did you say?
[08:02.16]I need to know what you said.
[08:03.94]Oh, embarrassment stream.
[08:06.37]I'm telling you, I might surprise some people here, because I, the last couple days, I really took this pretty seriously.
[08:12.56]I was like, what character do I want to play?
[08:13.94]I want to get familiar with it.
[08:15.98]Guys, I've played Smite for like a thousand hours.
[08:18.02]This is obviously like five, six, seven years ago now, but whatever.
[08:20.60]I think I'll do okay.
[08:23.10]And look, if I go 0 and 10, then I'll tell a couple of jokes, okay?
[08:29.20]And then we can relax.
[08:31.20]I think we've got a good chance, though.
[08:32.14]I really do.
[08:34.12]Although, maybe not the first game.
[08:35.80]We're playing the top seed first.
[08:38.26]So this will be a great indication if we do okay.
[08:41.78]If we actually beat this team, apparently this is one of the better teams.
[08:45.67]Right?
[08:45.95]You know what I'm saying?
[08:49.91]But what I'm saying is essentially this is free points.
[08:52.53]I don't think we're going to win the tournament.
[08:54.59]But I could be wrong.
[08:58.27]I'm just excited to participate.
[08:59.59]Should be fun.
[09:01.19]It's probably auto.
[09:02.37]No, no, your two is what you want at the beginning.
[09:04.55]Oh, so you want two and then one, then three?
[09:07.77]You'll level your three second, just so you have a safety ability to run away.
[09:12.12]But you're going to max your two, your one, your ult, and then your three.
[09:15.60]So, just curious.
[09:20.38]Should I be... Should I be auto build as Ares or should I have a specific build?
[09:25.05]Realistically, I'll write you out a build right now.
[09:27.93]Try to help you.
[09:28.52]Because I don't know what the auto builds are building and everything is so weird.
[09:31.06]What lane do I play?
[09:32.26]I was just going to look up a build.
[09:33.58]So I do appreciate that.
[09:35.22]You... You're good.
[09:36.92]also yeah this game apparently this jungler because I'm I'm a jungler I figured that because we were talking in the in the before a couple days ago it was like okay who knows how to play the game it's like I do okay sure for does um I think poke said he played for a little bit Russell said he's played it like years ago but I think like me and sure for had the most game knowledge right
[10:01.80]So it's like, okay, so I kind of had to play jungle, even though I'm, you know, we're talking Little League, right?
[10:09.03]If you take the best Little League player in the world, he's going to get struck out by a Major League Baseball player.
[10:16.87]I'm just, that's just a fact.
[10:18.97]So, right?
[10:20.31]That's what we're doing.
[10:25.37]What do you mean wrong?
[10:27.17]And by the way, these are all gamers.
[10:29.65]In the practice last night, Shore 4 was fucking dominating.
[10:34.15]Poke dominating.
[10:35.67]I'm not concerned.
[10:36.53]I think we're going to be fine.
[10:37.89]I'm going to turn out to be the little league bat boy.
[10:41.80]I'm not even on the little league team.
[10:43.18]You'll see.
[10:48.12]Whenever you can safely, just grab that.
[10:50.00]Go back to your lane.
[10:50.84]And then whenever that blue buff respawns, you want to do that every single time.
[10:57.64]Um, and, uh, I should be just, I should just upgrade one, three, and then two.
[11:02.12]Well, obviously four whenever I can, but okay.
[11:07.33]And then NoCo, I just typed up build in the chat.
[11:11.11]It's the same build folks going, so you're just gonna do that.
[11:14.49]Same thing.
[11:15.01]The first, second, third.
[11:16.57]And it doesn't matter about last hitting.
[11:18.85]It gives you extra gold if you can't last hit.
[11:20.53]Oh, this whole time I was like, whatever.
[11:21.95]Oh no, I gotta last hit then.
[11:23.61]You don't, in this game, you don't do it like, you definitely want to try, but you don't do it like League.
[11:27.29]It's not like you sit there and you wait.
[11:28.57]You just want to power clear the lane as fast as possible.
[11:31.72]I think we're getting a... We should be getting a lobby soon, right?
[11:35.42]Oh, it is AOE.
[11:36.22]Your autos are AOEs.
[11:37.12]Yeah, they go through creeps.
[11:38.12]No, not my AOE.
[11:40.01]My two.
[11:40.65]Two?
[11:40.89]Yep.
[11:41.57]So you'll just auto into it and it should clear very quick.
[11:44.09]You're one of the fastest clearing characters.
[11:46.53]So are we doing... Whoa.
[11:49.29]What happened?
[11:54.99]We have 10 minutes.
[11:56.91]So they said we were, I think you guys are going to be in a party or getting the custom game pretty soon.
[12:05.00]Great.
[12:10.78]I have no, I have only notifications turned off.
[12:12.73]Why would that even happen?
[12:21.05]So we should, we should get in a party then, right?
[12:24.26]Whenever you guys can.
[12:25.04]Okay, let's do that.
[12:25.94]Because somebody just tried to add me to their fucking party.
[12:30.50]We've got to get away from that.
[12:35.32]I think I have all of your in-game names, but I don't have Russell, I don't have you, and I don't have NoCo.
[12:50.09]You want to type your in-game names?
[12:52.98]Russell, are you here?
[12:54.10]I'm watching Russell.
[12:56.16]Russell is literally downloading the game right now and watching the tutorial.
[13:01.14]What did you say?
[13:02.78]You're downloading the game right now and watching a YouTube tutorial on how to play Smite.
[13:05.64]What are you doing?
[13:06.65]I've had this game since 2013.
[13:07.67]What are you doing, man?
[13:09.35]Get off.
[13:10.83]Excuse me.
[13:12.77]Wait, are you guys waiting for me?
[13:14.93]Yeah, just waiting on you, man.
[13:18.15]Were you watching the in-game embedded YouTube video?
[13:23.07]Do they still do that?
[13:25.71]Guys, I don't... I don't... I won't let you guys down.
[13:30.75]Are you sure?
[13:31.24]I'm in Poke's team.
[13:33.38]Or in his party.
[13:35.47]That was me.
[13:37.15]You're going to want to turn that off if you press... I think it's K. Are you in game still?
[13:43.47]Yeah.
[13:44.39]Press K and see if it says that right there.
[13:48.05]That's auto skill.
[13:48.75]You can turn that off.
[13:49.44]So who are we missing in the party?
[13:51.68]Yeah.
[13:52.00]I can leave.
[13:52.40]I can leave.
[13:52.76]Want me to leave?
[14:01.11]I think they're going to give us the ID, I think, soon.
[14:06.91]Is anyone nervous?
[14:08.09]I'm just curious.
[14:08.89]I'm not saying I am, but I'm just asking if anyone hears.
[14:11.45]Oh, God, I hear Russell twice.
[14:12.77]No, I've already accepted.
[14:14.01]If we go, like, oh, in 30.
[14:16.89]Because there's a voice chat in-game.
[14:20.01]Why are you, like, unhappy about that, Surefour?
[14:22.43]Because I don't want to hear anyone twice.
[14:25.17]Oh, okay.
[14:25.49]Well, that's understandable.
[14:26.51]I want to hear you guys only once for pure clarity.
[14:30.19]Okay.
[14:31.62]I just did push to toggle, so you shouldn't be able to hear me twice now.
[14:36.10]I dropped the jabberwockies.
[14:38.38]The jabberwockies?
[14:40.40]Are you talking about Struthnot?
[14:41.82]That's not who I was thinking of.
[14:43.08]Tell him to watch your smite video.
[14:46.00]I dropped your starter items in there, and then your full build is the one right after each of the full items.
[14:50.69]Okay.
[14:51.17]Alright, sounds good.
[14:53.43]Should I turn off auto build before we get in the game then?
[14:55.83]Yeah, I would.
[14:56.79]You can do it in settings, I think.
[14:58.51]Hold on.
[14:58.73]Let me see where it is.
[14:59.65]If anybody wants to know how to play...
[15:04.59]I had some pretty good tutorials back in 2012, if anyone was curious how to play the game.
[15:09.45]You have Smite tutorials?
[15:11.17]Yeah.
[15:12.13]I bought this back in 2013, so I probably watched it.
[15:15.61]Yeah.
[15:17.45]I actually have a guide for Ares, if you want to watch it.
[15:19.73]It's probably got some good tips in it.
[15:21.57]I'm going to go watch that right now, immediately.
[15:24.13]It's on your second or first channel?
[15:25.79]It's on the first channel.
[15:26.85]It's definitely worth watching, I'd say.
[15:29.99]It's not something that I wish I deleted.
[15:32.83]But it's fine.
[15:34.41]If you guys aren't in the game, by the way, you can press escape and then go to guides and turn everything you want off.
[15:38.43]It's alright there.
[15:39.79]Goal theory is like buried guide.

[16:32.75]Wait, what's the title of the video?
[16:36.12]It's this.
[16:36.96]What is it?
[16:37.54]Oh, man.
[16:39.70]What does it say?
[16:42.64]This dude's a beast.
[16:44.46]Holy shit.
[16:45.28]I was trying so hard.
[16:48.38]Ares, God of War.
[16:49.50]This dude's a beast.
[16:52.65]I hope he watches it.
[16:54.43]And hey, by the way, I'm going to act like, yeah, like, did you get anything from that?
[16:59.12]No, did you get something from that?
[17:00.42]I hope you did.
[17:01.42]Hopefully you learned something.
[17:05.19]QWER.
[17:06.63]Yeah, that's way better for me.
[17:08.73]Hold on.
[17:10.11]Settings.
[17:11.27]Abilities.
[17:13.53]You just can't change your W or you won't be able to walk forward.
[17:16.72]I was going to say, I feel like that's going to fuck with you more.
[17:19.12]Yeah, it might.
[17:22.36]Are you sure you want to switch to Snoko?
[17:24.34]No, 100%.
[17:24.72]Because I played League for a really long time.
[17:27.87]Alright, man.
[17:28.67]I believe you.
[17:32.25]You're breaking your no comedy rule?
[17:33.81]We're not playing.
[17:35.52]The no comedy serious rule is only for when I'm in the actual game.
[17:42.70]I'm probably not going to look at chat really much at all.
[17:48.76]The no comedy rule is only for game moments.
[17:55.94]are y'all getting the battle pass I think I bought it already I don't know how much even is this in like money wait how do you battle pass I'm trying to think well it's q w e r is league what's the same thing
[18:28.28]16,000 gems.
[18:28.70]I've never had this many gems in my whole life, this whole game.
[18:31.83]Do you feel freaking rich right now?
[18:35.01]I just, I look up at there and I'm just like, I bought the 400 gem Bakasura metal skin.
[18:42.51]It's like, I kind of feel like I need to have one of the crazy ones.
[18:45.10]Does Bakasura have a crazy one?
[18:48.78]I got some pretty good skins.
[18:50.36]They're not nuts.
[18:51.06]The craziest one you probably can't buy unless they gave it to you is the Feast of Blood.
[18:54.98]This is the one I'm going to be using.
[18:57.08]Sick.
[18:59.74]Oh, wait, I can buy... Is this the Stranger Things?
[19:03.11]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:04.07]The special one?
[19:04.61]That's crazy.
[19:05.09]You walk around kind of creepy.
[19:08.49]I don't... But I don't want to... Okay, can I buy this if I've never seen an episode of Stranger Things?
[19:13.64]Yeah, I mean, they just look like little monster things.
[19:19.02]This one's cool.
[19:22.35]This one's too cool for me, though.
[19:23.75]I kind of like the... I miss this Bakasura, like I told you last night.
[19:27.86]Who's the burger?
[19:29.98]Well, then play the OG Bakasura, bro.
[19:33.14]I know.
[19:35.74]Is the burger good?
[19:37.15]Yeah, he's pretty good.
[19:37.95]He's, like, kind of easy.
[19:40.11]Like, when you're solo playing, you don't really die a lot.
[19:42.35]You're a support, though.
[19:46.14]How would anyone know that's the character?
[19:47.44]It's a goddamn burger.
[19:49.51]Their skins are like that all the time.
[19:52.41]As you play the game.
[19:55.95]Reminds me of the old TF2 thing they used to say.
[19:59.03]We want to make sure we keep the silhouettes the same.
[20:02.09]We want to make sure you can tell who it is from across the whole map.
[20:05.69]I don't want to join a fan club.
[20:07.59]I just finished watching the Jerma vid.
[20:09.39]I think I'm good on Ares now.
[20:10.43]You think you're good to go?
[20:11.77]Yep.
[20:12.57]I got this.
[20:13.29]I really think we're going to win this tournament.
[20:14.89]How do you block all notifications from coming up?
[20:19.35]IDK.
[20:20.21]I don't know.
[20:21.27]I can't do it apparently.
[20:23.54]Is that going to pop up in the games?
[20:24.90]I hope not.
[20:26.48]No.
[20:26.98]I hope not.
[20:28.36]If it does, you'll find out.
[20:32.84]The death toll, transcendence, wind demon, that's all for me.
[20:36.64]That's first, second, third.
[20:38.52]That's in order.
[20:40.32]Fully build the item before you start another item.
[20:46.57]So if you are in game and you type in like you you can search at the top Can I buy that stole they're good I'm on D&D no You already have a starter.
[21:02.35]You only buy one starter at him.
[21:04.03]Oh, then I'm gonna sell and then sell and do this, right?
[21:08.53]So, okay
[21:11.55]This is the other god I would be playing.
[21:14.71]Why can't I buy it?
[21:15.47]I'm back.
[21:17.33]Some of them are locked.
[21:18.40]Are you in the base?
[21:19.98]Yeah.
[21:20.80]Are you clicking on one of the higher ones like Death's Embrace or something?
[21:23.82]No.
[21:24.82]I'm literally clicking Death's Gold.
[21:26.44]Should I get this one?
[21:27.80]You have the gold?
[21:28.38]You have six with the gold?
[21:29.40]I have 5,000.
[21:35.50]You can't change your starter item.
[21:37.90]I sold it.
[21:38.50]It's because you left the base already.
[21:39.70]Yeah, that's why.
[21:40.40]It's because you already left the base.
[21:42.87]Once you buy one, that's your item for the game.
[21:45.23]Would it be weird if in Mizkiff's Smite Tournament, I played as Mizkiff and just did all the voice spams, which is annoying?
[21:53.65]Does it really matter as long as you don't think it's weird?
[21:57.67]You do you, man.
[21:58.25]Exactly.
[21:59.07]Let your memes be dreams.
[22:02.96]Who's Miskov?
[22:05.22]I don't know.
[22:06.40]I got a random DM.
[22:07.40]I just didn't know what to say.
[22:08.98]I was like, yeah, I've played Smite before.
[22:12.56]It's not like I begged him in public to make sure I was able to play today.
[22:18.38]Are you trying to make some money?
[22:21.08]Yeah, let me know when I gotta leave.
[22:22.96]What's the first place team win?
[22:24.60]I think this is very important.
[22:25.68]12k each.
[22:27.62]12k each person?
[22:29.00]Yep, 70k for first place.
[22:33.08]Wow, so how do we win?
[22:36.79]If you buckle up and don't be a problem.
[22:39.63]Yeah, just carry.
[22:40.91]Alright, that sounds good then.
[22:44.16]Yeah, we wanted the best out of you, man.
[22:46.87]No, I am gonna be the best.
[22:48.11]That's the thing.
[22:48.73]Like, I genuinely believe I am the best.
[22:51.55]Okay, we're fucked.
[22:52.91]Oh, okay.
[22:53.95]Dude, this monster has a nice butt.
[22:55.71]Dude, this skin's crazy.
[22:56.79]Huh?
[22:57.17]You say monster?
[22:58.53]Oh, no, I thought you were talking about... Wait, you're talking about me?
[23:00.71]Yeah, no, no.
[23:00.95]Okay, do you want to see what I'm talking about?
[23:02.19]Go to the chests.
[23:04.58]Go to Imperial.
[23:06.48]Go to chests.
[23:07.28]Imperial chests.
[23:09.14]Look at the fourth one.
[23:10.94]Where are the chests?
[23:12.56]In the store.
[23:14.76]Chests...
[23:17.19]Imperial?
[23:18.61]Yeah, look for Imperial.
[23:19.95]I see it.
[23:22.31]The fourth character, the siren song.
[23:24.18]Goose chase?
[23:24.92]Is that what you're talking about?
[23:26.54]You're saying the siren is hot?
[23:28.74]No, turn around.
[23:31.50]Wait, it's Nami.
[23:32.62]You're making it weird the longer it takes.
[23:34.03]Wait, where is it?
[23:34.57]Is it chests?
[23:35.03]Or is it in the store?
[23:37.94]It's not nice.
[23:38.58]It's just like there.
[23:39.76]It's like they drew that.
[23:41.54]Yeah, she's got a nice figure, I would say.
[23:43.34]Well, they don't draw it.
[23:46.66]Do I have 27 chests to open?
[23:49.50]Sorry, I made this way.
[23:50.83]You have a bunch of chests to open, too.
[23:52.27]I do?
[23:52.93]Where are they?
[23:53.57]Okay, you see the little gift box at the bottom right?
[23:56.39]You press that and you go to chests.
[23:58.47]Lobby's up.
[23:59.59]Oh, shit.
[24:00.21]Alright, we gotta get in the lobby.
[24:01.21]Alright, so we need... We're missing somebody here.

[25:13.47]If all five of you are in there, you'll just go to play and then go to custom and find their game.
[25:17.45]And I think you need to know the password.
[25:18.94]Yeah, it's in here.
[25:20.12]That's in the egg skin, bro?
[25:25.00]That's actually sick.

[25:39.55]Am I cool to show this screen now?
[25:42.89]Is that alright?
[25:43.29]There's nothing on here, right?
[25:44.69]As long as you don't show them the password, you're done typing in.
[25:47.21]Wait, how do we not show them the password?
[25:49.31]I had to do it.
[25:50.31]We were in a party, so we got auto-typed to it.
[25:54.97]Wait, is there a way to turn off notifications and stuff or no?
[25:59.21]I just put on D&D.
[26:00.95]Go to your top right, click on your name, and go to friends list.
[26:03.91]Actually, go to friends list, bottom right.
[26:05.41]It's like the two people standing next to each other.
[26:07.86]And just put yourself on do not disturb.
[26:09.60]I have one friend.
[26:12.60]Yeah, but as soon as your cat sees your shit, they're going to fucking spam you.
[26:18.96]Oh, my voice is junk.
[26:21.68]So, okay, so this is the team that we need to be concerned with, right?
[26:24.87]That's what you're saying?
[26:26.51]It's Mendo, right?
[26:27.39]Mendo's team.
[26:28.65]Senny.
[26:29.01]You see, I forget.
[26:30.27]Senny's team.
[26:30.89]Okay.
[26:31.83]That's Artemis build you gave me, right?
[26:33.79]Yeah.
[26:33.93]That is the Artemis build.
[26:35.53]Yes, sir.
[26:40.22]I'm not scared at all.
[26:47.86]You should be.
[26:48.56]I have an Artemis video?
[26:59.32]No, you don't have an Artemis video.
[27:00.72]I looked at all your Smite videos.
[27:02.12]Yeah, I didn't want to do the Stranger Things one.
[27:12.07]I feel like I might look like a default enemy from a random FPS game.
[27:17.04]Yeah, you would.
[27:18.22]It would be cringe.
[27:29.12]It's a Doom enemy.
[27:31.18]But look, okay.
[27:31.96]In the show, Stranger Things, I'm sure it's cool.
[27:34.34]I've never seen it.
[27:34.96]But I just... For this game, with like a bunch of gods fighting each other and like a Bakasura.
[27:40.24]I don't know.
[27:41.02]I feel like you're kind of a guy.
[27:43.24]Can I unlock the Queen of Cards?
[27:45.92]I don't know how many gems they give you.
[27:48.67]They gave me 8,000.
[27:50.45]Or it's 10,000, really.
[27:51.29]That should be enough if it's available.
[27:53.63]If you go... Do I have to buy all?
[27:57.13]Yeah, if you click on the skin, it should say like this much to buy everything and you have to buy everything.
[28:01.61]Oh What no, it's nine thousand two hundred forty.
[28:03.67]I don't have enough Okay, it sounds like you need to swipe boy I I literally am going to minimize my chat at that one once the game starts cuz I know I'm gonna look over there cuz I'm gonna miss something I'm gonna miss like I'm gonna miss click on something and I'm gonna see a bunch of Omega levels It's gonna fuck with me so I can not gonna look
[28:19.47]But you get affected that much by a little bit of Omega Lulls?
[28:22.47]Oh yeah, of course I do.
[28:23.49]I look over if something goes wrong and I see Omega Lull, like he sucks so bad, it affects me.
[28:28.31]I can't look at it.
[28:28.95]Okay, what if they all start saying poggers, he did it instead?
[28:32.18]Then I get way too overconfident.
[28:33.66]Yeah, exactly.
[28:35.18]You're like, oh fuck, I did a good play.
[28:36.68]I gotta do something else.
[28:37.64]I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[28:38.60]And then chat stops fogging and you're like, fuck, now you're even more insecure.
[28:42.14]So you guys are very affected by the emotes coming at you.
[28:45.66]Yeah, of course.
[28:46.62]I can see the omegalos in the corner of my eye without even looking at it.
[28:50.22]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[28:52.04]What if you saw them spamming?
[28:53.36]Oh, my God, it's Lakari chasing you through the boreal winter.
[28:56.51]Please run and find cover.
[28:57.83]He has bad intentions.
[29:00.13]I would have no idea what the fuck that meant.
[29:08.28]They did me dirty, bro.
[29:11.30]I have that emote just shortened.
[29:12.96]He chasing.
[29:14.60]That's too much to type.
[29:20.44]Wait, that's an emote?
[29:22.30]Yeah.
[29:22.68]You want to see it?
[29:24.42]You can have an emote that's that long?
[29:27.31]Well, it's like a third party.
[29:30.13]Oh, that's insane.
[29:31.19]I think my smite crashed.
[29:33.81]Uh-oh.
[29:34.77]Uh-oh.
[29:36.93]Wait.
[29:40.25]So draft, that means, are there mirrors in a draft?
[29:46.04]Any devs are watching?
[29:47.14]I would like a thousand more gems, please.
[29:49.84]They typed that out.
[29:50.72]Let me read this real quick.
[29:51.44]No, there's no bans.
[29:52.38]You're doing draft just because it's an order pick.
[29:55.08]Okay.
[29:56.04]But they can still be a mirror in a draft?
[30:00.59]I don't think so.
[30:03.37]Unless I'm getting trolled.
[30:09.38]Yeah, no, there shouldn't be.
[30:10.48]There shouldn't be no mirror picks.
[30:12.92]That's why the orders actually matters, and when you pick, it matters.
[30:16.38]They can take your shit, or you can take theirs.
[30:18.44]Okay.
[30:20.15]I got it.
[30:21.17]I don't think they will.
[30:22.65]I think I know what they're going to play.
[30:27.93]Yeah, they probably know everything we're doing, dude.
[30:30.27]What are they doing?
[30:30.75]Dude, oh my god, I got an idea.
[30:32.51]What if we do five Winstons and just fucking run at the point?
[30:37.87]We have five Winstons and we just all jump on them?
[30:39.51]And we all go to mid-tower.
[30:42.30]That'd be poggers, actually.
[30:44.64]Can we pick the same character?
[30:47.44]I don't think so.
[30:49.52]Wait, there's a character called Winston?
[30:51.68]Yeah.
[30:57.35]People did not like that one.
[30:59.61]I looked it up.
[31:00.73]Why would they not like that?
[31:01.87]I don't know.
[31:14.50]Where's Mizkif?
[31:16.02]I want a personal hello and I want a personal in every team voice chat him coming in and introducing the event.
[31:23.07]Where is he?
[31:23.75]They're introducing it right now actually.
[31:25.41]He's casting it.
[31:27.09]I thought he was a player.
[31:28.62]I did too.
[31:29.02]He was supposed to play and then he was supposed to coach or cast and then he wasn't going to do anything and then I don't know what happened.
[31:36.88]So there's no bans.
[31:38.55]Are you able to just be in the call with us the whole time?
[31:42.53]You can't be in the call the entire time?
[31:44.37]Yeah, this isn't going to be interesting.
[31:47.13]Well, there are no picks.
[31:48.19]There's no bans.
[31:49.35]There's orders.
[31:50.29]Like what order you should pick shit?
[31:52.65]I bought the bundle.
[31:54.10]And I can kind of run you through what they're going to be doing with their picks.
[31:57.31]So if you guys want to... Weekend, you're streaming, right?
[32:00.35]Yep.
[32:00.81]So if you guys want to watch somebody kind of put their hands in their head and kind of look down for however long the tournament is.
[32:06.57]Because you're going to be screaming at us to do something.
[32:11.00]You're going to be like, oh my god, please go that way.
[32:13.88]And we can't hear you.
[32:16.06]So we can...
[32:17.00]If you want to go watch the disappointment, it'll be on WeekendStream.
[32:22.27]I thought you were here holding our hand the entire time.
[32:24.67]So did I. I thought that's what it was going to be at first, too.
[32:27.25]Oh, my God.
[32:28.59]This is a whole different, like, ball game.
[32:31.23]I feel like I'm playing a different game right now.
[32:33.34]So now you're scared.
[32:34.68]No, I'm not scared.
[32:35.48]Of course not.
[32:36.16]I still...
[32:38.92]Do I have time to get the tea?
[32:40.98]No.
[32:42.54]You have no time to do anything.
[32:45.06]You have to sit here now.
[32:47.06]Who's drinking tea here?
[32:48.26]Me.
[32:50.46]What type of tea?
[32:52.30]You a tea guy?
[32:53.82]Yeah, I do like tea, but what type of tea are you drinking?
[32:56.35]Matcha.
[32:57.99]Wait, matcha tea is good.
[32:59.09]I actually like matcha tea.
[33:00.63]Alright, there you go.
[33:02.01]Alright.
[33:03.93]I like green tea.
[33:05.15]I like...
[33:07.90]I don't like Jasmine tea, though.
[33:10.28]It's a little too much.
[33:12.18]Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Jasmine, but green tea is alright.
[33:15.14]When I was younger, I used to like a lot of green tea.
[33:17.76]Why are we in queue for seven minutes?
[33:20.09]It just says that for as long as we... Yeah, it's near the custom game for seven minutes.
[33:23.69]It's because they're still announcing teams and shit.
[33:26.95]Oh, okay.
[33:27.83]Yeah, so don't be nervous, Poke.
[33:29.27]Chill, bitch.
[33:29.97]Damn.
[33:30.49]It is like perfume.
[33:31.49]It is like perfume.
[33:32.23]I'm freaking out.
[33:36.35]Okay, we're going against Mendo's team?
[33:38.21]Leans back with you.
[33:39.43]Yep.
[33:40.27]Oh no.
[33:41.91]Every time I drink green tea with Jasmine, I just feel like I'm walking through the perfume section of a Macy's.
[33:48.39]I like getting black tea in my boba.
[33:52.13]That's good.
[33:52.86]Ooh.
[33:54.30]I bought the juicy Izanami skin.
[33:56.10]I'm going fucking deep.
[33:57.04]90, 200 green gems later.
[33:58.28]So you swiped.
[34:03.18]no I didn't swipe I I I had some extra epic coins so I only had to put nine dollars oh yeah dude they gave me they gave me some some nom noms epic coins or vault whatever the you want to go in the epic wait so
[34:23.18]Are we all playing at the same time, or is it one team at a time?
[34:25.56]I mean, two teams at a time.
[34:26.64]I'm pretty sure it's round robin, so you all have to be.
[34:29.18]There's no way you aren't playing at the same time.
[34:31.50]Okay.
[34:31.94]So on the main broadcast, are they just going to be jumping around, or are they just picking a game in each round?
[34:38.75]My guess is they're going to pick a game, but their production dude is from Smite, so I don't know.
[34:44.95]He might get a little bit into it.
[34:49.21]Oh, my God.
[34:51.73]Oh, my glob.
[34:58.19]Why can't we just do, like, a rock, paper, scissors?
[35:00.79]Yeah, dude, these queues.
[35:02.27]10-minute queue.
[35:03.06]Hi-res.
[35:03.60]What the fuck is this?
[35:06.36]10 minute queue.
[35:07.98]Hey, the queue times are completely fine.
[35:10.18]And this game is pop.
[35:12.18]Wait, what?
[35:12.72]Single limb.
[35:13.48]That's what my chat's saying.
[35:14.84]So it's not best of three.
[35:15.74]It's like.
[35:16.20]Wait, we're going to get knocked out right now, potentially?
[35:18.62]No, you're going to win.
[35:20.06]Wait, I thought we were playing everybody once.
[35:21.92]No, Jerma, we're going to knock out the other team right now.
[35:24.38]Okay, no, I think I'm being trolled.
[35:25.52]I think my chat's being trolled.
[35:26.23]You have to be getting trolled.
[35:27.03]There's no way.
[35:28.75]Yeah.
[35:30.11]It's group stages, so it has to be where you have to play everybody once.
[35:32.45]If you don't, it's just dumb.
[35:33.37]Yeah, that would make no sense.
[35:35.13]I think what they mean by single limb round robin is you face everyone on your group once, top two go, bottom two leave type thing.
[35:44.94]And no losers bracket.
[35:46.50]So this is going to be a long tournament then, huh?
[35:50.16]Strap in.
[35:50.66]Strap in.
[35:54.29]Alright, I got to pee because you can't play a tournament with a... I have to.
[36:00.04]There's no way I can pee.
[36:00.90]Actually, wait.
[36:01.40]If you don't pee, though, playing under pressure actually makes you play better sometimes.
[36:04.62]I actually made a video about that.
[36:07.12]Then come back.
[36:08.85]So what was your your hypothesis?
[36:11.69]Well, my here's my hypothesis inclusion.
[36:13.82]I'm drinking a bunch of tea So right now I have to pee now and I'm drinking a bunch of tea I know but but but listen listen to me
[36:29.32]I'm the captain, you listen to the captain.
[36:31.62]Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir.
[36:33.02]If you drink, okay, if you drink too much, if you have to pee and you keep drinking water and shit, then I'm trying to get in front of the pee that's going to have to happen in an hour when we're in the game and I can't leave.
[36:42.81]You understand?
[36:43.51]But if you keep holding it in, your balls are going to explode because pee is stored in the balls.
[36:47.57]Alright, I'll be right back.
[36:49.09]Are we pissing?
[36:51.23]Yeah, we're peeing.
[36:52.21]Okay, I'm pissing.
[36:54.61]Alright, I'll be right back.
[36:58.29]I'll just leave the chat open, whatever.
[37:02.42]Purification beads and aegis amulet.
[37:03.42]Do I have to buy those or set those?
[37:05.42]They're free so when you start you get one of them at level one and then level 12 you get the other one.
[37:10.42]Which one do I get first?
[37:11.42]The purification beads. Get them in the exact order I typed them.
[37:13.42]Not gonna lie that sounds dirty.
[37:16.42]Just beads to get out of-
[37:18.42]Yeah, purification beads, did they really think this through? When they made that?
[37:23.42]I'm not really a beads guy I'm more of a plug kind of guy.
[37:25.42]Oh okay yeah - maybe they should rename it to purification plug. yeah 100 percent better
[37:30.42]Yeah, 100% better.
[37:35.80]Go high res.
[37:50.23]Hello?
[37:52.31]Hello?
[37:53.33]You're very quiet.
[37:54.45]Real pissing?
[37:55.43]Yeah, everyone's just peeing.
[37:59.59]Wait, what the fuck is that?
[38:02.37]Slipknot skins available?
[38:06.39]Yeah.
[38:07.77]You know my cousins in Slipknot?
[38:09.89]Are you trolling?
[38:11.99]Yeah, no, he's actually one of the main singers.
[38:14.37]I don't believe that.
[38:15.31]I don't believe it either.
[38:16.51]Yeah, his name's James.
[38:19.13]Oh, wait, no, that actually does make sense.
[38:21.97]Wait, no, that actually is his cousin.
[38:23.29]Yeah.
[38:25.99]He's an asshole, though.
[38:26.91]He doesn't talk to us.
[38:29.41]He never gave the family money at all.
[38:31.89]That's fucked up.
[38:33.02]That is fucked up.
[38:35.24]All my homies hate James.
[38:37.56]And we all listen to Yeet now.
[38:38.64]What do you guys listen to?
[38:41.20]Uh... I can't listen to anything because I'm at the MCA.
[38:44.08]I got a devil on my phone.
[38:45.37]You know we keep doing this shit.
[38:46.63]Yeah.
[38:46.93]True.
[38:47.09]Russell, when are you going to make a new song, man?
[38:51.67]Your last song.
[38:52.69]Come on, man.
[38:53.45]Dude, listen.
[38:54.45]I'm not even kidding.
[38:55.21]I want to get back in the booth, okay?
[38:56.68]I need to prove myself.
[38:57.72]You know, I got something to prove.
[38:58.80]I'm like a little baby.
[39:00.54]Let's go do it this week.
[39:02.14]You guys do play three games, by the way.
[39:05.23]What?
[39:05.65]You have three matches.
[39:06.95]We're playing back-to-back-to-back.
[39:08.43]Against them?
[39:09.33]No, no, no.
[39:09.77]One's against this team, and then Amiru's team, and then Tekton's team.
[39:13.33]And then whoever wins the most out of those goes to finals.
[39:15.71]Probably finals, or you have like semi-finals or some shit.
[39:21.57]Anher has awesome skins.
[39:23.39]Fuck.
[39:26.29]Looks like you need to swipe a little bit more.
[39:28.45]Yeah, no, but I can't get the skins.
[39:31.83]Yeah, what the fuck is my... Oh, got it.
[39:36.11]You can't get the spins anymore.
[39:39.35]What's so freaking funny over there, man?
[39:41.49]Yeah, what's hilarious?
[39:44.39]Anything you want to share with the class?
[39:47.50]I don't know why I laughed with my mic open.
[39:49.64]That has actually really rooted me, guys.
[39:51.18]Yeah, and now you have to explain.
[39:52.62]I went to Ember's chat and I said she sucks and that she's going to lose.
[39:59.23]And she insulted me and I thought it was funny.
[40:01.83]How did she insult you?
[40:03.45]She said, what the fuck, Russell?
[40:05.31]You did not open up spite until this morning.
[40:07.41]Which, that is not true.
[40:08.33]I don't know why she said that.
[40:09.43]That is true, actually.
[40:09.97]I've been practicing all week.
[40:11.60]Literally what she said is true.
[40:12.82]I have more hours than you, Surefour.
[40:15.16]I'm literally a higher level than you in this game.
[40:17.84]Dude.
[40:20.22]Somebody's being toxic?
[40:21.08]I grab it.
[40:21.80]I have more hours in real life than you children.
[40:23.84]Wait, so who's being toxic?
[40:25.39]And I swallow it on my own terms.
[40:26.97]Somebody said toxic.
[40:28.07]Calm down.
[40:30.09]Who's being toxic?
[40:31.05]I'm the team captain.
[40:32.41]I need to know who my team needs to be.
[40:34.09]Start providing some order here.
[40:36.29]What do you think I'm doing?
[40:38.17]Who?
[40:39.05]You're not even listening.
[40:40.63]Okay, alright.
[40:43.57]Guys, I'm telling you, I think I'm the best Ares that has ever stepped foot in this game.
[40:48.70]Why is that?
[40:50.40]I just, like, I played today and I'm like, holy hell, I am so hot.
[40:55.64]Dude, come on.
[40:57.89]Whoever says I'm the captain is not captain at all.
[41:03.19]What's that from?
[41:03.71]What's that from?
[41:04.23]What's that from?
[41:06.07]It's from Pirates of the Caribbean.
[41:08.95]No, I'll do it again.
[41:09.49]I'll do it one more time.
[41:10.45]I got a job.
[41:11.92]I got a job.
[41:14.60]Huh?
[41:15.14]That's not... Incorrect.
[41:16.54]What are you talking about?
[41:21.10]I do not know the most famous line.
[41:22.94]No, I'll do it again.
[41:23.58]Do the line.
[41:24.66]Do the line.
[41:25.14]Do the line.
[41:25.93]Whoever says that they are the captain is no captain at all.
[41:33.21]Why does that sound like fucking... Oh, that's the Burning Crusade.
[41:39.01]Burning Crusade, that's correct.
[41:42.67]King Anduin Wynne says it to Thrall.
[41:46.27]Guys, we're in.
[41:47.81]I knew it.
[41:48.67]I'm so smart.
[41:49.41]Here we go.
[41:50.87]Can they see what I'm picking?
[41:52.95]What do we do?
[41:54.46]Guys, at the top of the screen, it says no tank.
[41:56.83]We have a problem.
[41:59.95]No, it's me.
[42:02.43]I just wildcard, dude.
[42:03.61]Just pick fucking Cupid and freak him out.
[42:05.97]Wait, what if they pick... Can we have same legends?
[42:08.47]Same people?
[42:08.99]No.
[42:09.31]Probably not.
[42:10.35]What if they pick... Oh my god.
[42:12.72]We're gonna hope they don't.
[42:14.80]Alright, so it's my...
[42:16.46]is there one each or one two am I picking right now I think it's me both of your hunter you guys can trade with each other so I would pick the two hunters you want right now Artemis and the izanami see right now right now oh
[42:30.65]Oh shit.
[42:31.01]We lock in?
[42:31.51]We lock Izanami?
[42:32.37]Can you lock Izanami?
[42:33.13]I lock those in because those are the ones you're worried about them.
[42:35.31]Or you can do the Baka as well.
[42:36.69]Let's go.
[42:36.92]Yeah, I didn't know.
[42:38.64]The select things.
[42:39.92]I've heard of this Wontep guy.
[42:41.98]Oh, we've seen a Freya.
[42:53.44]Like any of us give a shit.
[42:56.18]We all learned how to play one god like four days ago.
[42:58.73]How did we counter pick that?
[43:01.39]Four days ago?
[43:02.03]How about like 40 minutes ago?
[43:03.39]Yeah.
[43:04.97]You're in a little more trouble than I think everybody else.
[43:07.47]If you wanted to pick Izanami for me, that'd be like great.
[43:10.80]Guys, you don't have to worry.
[43:12.22]They're literally just all picking the stuff they were one tricking.
[43:15.08]You don't have to worry anymore.
[43:16.24]Most of your shit is picked already.
[43:18.34]What you're going to play against is picked.
[43:19.60]By the way, short for skin was $100.
[43:21.00]Just want to make sure everyone knows.
[43:22.94]Yeah, but I got it for free, motherfucker.
[43:26.32]For free?
[43:27.48]You got it for free?
[43:31.13]Hello?
[43:31.93]Hello?
[43:34.41]Guys, I'm getting told Ullr into Freya.
[43:38.79]Do it.
[43:39.61]As the team captain, I'd say do it.
[43:41.28]Okay.
[43:41.96]Okay.
[43:42.54]Thank you.
[43:42.78]Why didn't you pick?
[43:44.56]I'm pretty sure Freya's going mid.
[43:47.62]My skin is... Oh, there you go.
[43:51.88]I pick now?
[43:53.19]I cannot see chat anymore.
[43:54.99]I need to pay attention over here, guys.
[43:57.43]I'm sorry.
[43:59.21]You're already referring to them even though you're not looking at them anymore.
[44:03.24]I know.
[44:08.94]Yeah, I'm sure.
[44:10.46]Yeah, why did you have extra time?
[44:12.90]They give you extra time in case something... Wait, I'm trying to lock it in.
[44:16.31]Oh, when nobody locked in.
[44:17.55]Got it.
[44:18.09]Yeah, you have like a set time and then they can add time to it.
[44:21.53]Oh, that's cool.
[44:21.87]Because they didn't want to have to remake if this happened.
[44:25.65]Anybody else just not... Your chair is in the wrong settings.
[44:29.55]Lock in, Russell.
[44:32.25]Game closed.
[44:33.70]Hello?
[44:34.06]What happened?
[44:36.30]Guys, am I good?
[44:37.52]Hello?
[44:37.80]Hello?
[44:39.34]Yeah, we can hear you.
[44:41.13]Are you fucking trolling, Russell?
[44:42.25]I kicked out my Ethernet.
[44:44.77]Huh?
[44:45.41]What are you doing?
[44:46.21]You're still here.
[44:47.98]I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[44:51.01]Did your Wi-Fi pick it up?
[44:53.67]Yeah, why is it not letting me pick?
[44:55.05]Oh, wait.
[44:57.39]Oh, shit.
[45:00.26]No way.
[45:02.66]So, do we have to restart?
[45:04.58]Will it just lock it in?
[45:05.52]It'll close in 10 seconds.
[45:06.50]It'll close the whole lobby in 10 seconds.
[45:07.88]He already picked Ares, though.
[45:11.34]Then you're good, and he just needs to stay in game.
[45:13.59]Oh, he picked Ares.
[45:14.71]So, we're good.
[45:15.19]Am I in?
[45:16.51]Yeah, you're good.
[45:18.05]We have one second.
[45:18.59]Why did you not show me that I picked it though?
[45:20.59]Just stay in game.
[45:21.69]Just wait for them to tell you Lobby started and then restart your game.
[45:25.27]We got a... Number one victory.
[45:28.69]So the Freya and the Xing 10 are in your duo lane.
[45:32.33]NoCo, you're against the top character, the Bologna.
[45:34.29]They can disarm you.
[45:35.23]Bologna?
[45:36.42]Fuck them.
[45:36.82]Bologna, yeah.
[45:41.36]Looking at the... We might have the skin advantage here.
[45:43.75]We have two $100 skins.
[45:45.33]We're already like swagged on them.
[45:46.83]Dude, when you... Why is your skin $100?
[45:48.69]You see that?
[45:50.52]You see that, baby?
[45:51.46]Look at that shit.
[45:52.18]Watch me transform again.
[45:53.06]Do it.
[45:55.61]Dude, when you locked that, when you locked that Izanami, holy shit.
[46:00.68]Dude, the crowd went crazy when you just locked in the Izanami.
[46:05.08]I'm just telling you.
[46:05.82]How do you know?
[46:08.00]I can hear them.
[46:09.18]You can't hear them?
[46:09.71]They're screaming.
[46:11.09]Oh.
[46:12.83]You can hear them.
[46:14.45]We just got two countdowns.
[46:17.33]When you guys are in loading screen, tell Russell so he can restart his game.
[46:23.19]We are loading right now.
[46:25.83]I'm still watching your stream and you can't see anything, right?
[46:28.53]I'm loading now.
[46:29.59]I'm good then, right?
[46:30.59]Thank you.
[46:30.95]Bye.
[46:37.27]This guy's like a Freya one trick.
[46:39.38]Alright, so you guys know what's going on here?
[46:42.08]Let's break this down.
[46:44.28]Guys, let's win.
[46:45.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[46:47.06]Who am I?
[46:48.12]I have to buy the starting amulet.
[46:52.30]Yeah, get the starting item.
[46:54.10]Which is beads.
[46:57.12]What's my starting item?
[46:59.32]Remember, guys, let's go to our respective buffs and help each other win.
[47:03.02]Is this Peter Griffin?

[60:45.93]Alright, good.
[60:49.66]Wait, he's getting XP camp maybe.
[60:51.24]We should get XP camp.
[60:53.14]Let's get XP camp.
[60:55.04]It's dead.
[60:55.50]Yeah, they got it.
[60:56.14]Fuck.
[60:56.28]Shit.
[60:56.86]Wait, our lane's missing.
[60:57.77]Our lane's missing.
[60:58.33]I'm waiting for an item.
[61:00.29]I just can't believe I didn't kill.
[61:01.51]They hit, like, two ticks.
[61:03.39]Wait, there's a maximum.
[61:04.01]You want to kill this guy?
[61:04.61]You want to kill this guy?
[61:05.83]Yeah, yeah, go on.
[61:11.38]I should have cleaned that up.
[61:12.24]I just can't hurt them.
[61:14.62]I'm just so underleveled.
[61:15.42]Fuck.
[61:15.60]Fuck.
[61:16.08]If you, yeah, if you want to wait for me, I'm like, I can farm pretty hard.
[61:20.30]What the fuck just happened?
[61:23.14]Yeah, we can be dying.
[61:24.26]I hate him.
[61:27.13]We cannot be dying like that.
[61:33.15]I'm getting pretty strong, though.
[61:35.33]Yeah, this is not over.
[61:37.51]Just saying.
[61:37.96]Yeah, Freya does a lot of damage.
[61:40.46]Daji's right here.
[61:41.26]Be careful.
[61:43.56]We actually might be able to get her.
[61:46.80]That means that two or three people are probably right here.
[61:49.06]Are they looking?
[61:49.48]No, they're not looking over there.
[61:51.32]My money's low.
[61:52.04]Let's get this.
[61:53.78]I'm waiting for items.
[61:55.04]Oh, they're going to try to steal it, aren't they?
[62:02.76]Oh, my God.
[62:03.76]No way.
[62:04.66]That ain't happening.
[62:05.26]I got thieves.
[62:05.91]Thieves is big.
[62:06.61]I got thieves.
[62:07.19]Oh, what the fuck?
[62:08.25]Yeah, we got to back up.
[62:08.99]We got to back up.
[62:10.17]I have no idea what this person's ult does.
[62:13.41]I thought it already went past whatever the fuck it does, and then it went again.
[62:17.90]Poke, don't die, please.
[62:19.50]I'm in lane.
[62:21.16]Oh, okay.
[62:22.32]Fast right, just do this.
[62:23.68]Our tower's destroyed.
[62:26.82]Which one?
[62:28.04]Right side.
[62:32.79]Oh, they're killing.
[62:33.55]Yeah, we got to get some of these objectives, I think.
[62:38.38]Okay.
[62:38.86]Although, I think we're just far behind.
[62:41.60]If we can get to, like, level 15 to 20-ish, I think we'd be okay.
[62:46.35]We just have to get there.
[62:47.05]Okay, sounds good.
[62:49.31]Let's do it.
[62:49.61]Alright, alright.
[62:51.89]Yeah, let's back up.
[62:53.81]Russell?
[62:55.15]I'm here, I'm here.
[62:56.40]Oh my fucking god.
[62:57.52]I'm protecting my left tower, but this Bologna is fucking... What the... Got him.
[63:12.81]They're so overleveled.
[63:14.15]I gotta get out of here.
[63:15.03]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[63:15.73]Yeah, this Bologna is fucking insane.
[63:24.32]We actually won that exchange.
[63:26.48]We're good.
[63:27.56]Russell, you didn't see him coming?
[63:30.10]Did you see him coming?
[63:31.54]Yes, he was between the traps.
[63:34.86]Honestly, I might just give up left.
[63:36.80]You're behind me all game.
[63:39.08]I'm pretty strong.
[63:40.66]I might be able to... Oh, no.
[63:42.32]Team arguments.
[63:43.82]We're supposed to avoid these.
[63:45.88]I think solo lane, you live on your own island until mid-end game.
[63:50.44]I don't know.
[63:51.57]I don't know how the pacing works differently in Smite or not.
[63:56.21]Yeah, we're not in bad shape.
[63:57.49]We really aren't.
[63:58.21]We can pull this back.
[63:58.97]We're only down like 8k gold.
[64:03.32]Yeah, gold don't matter.
[64:04.24]It's the clutch time is what matters.
[64:09.32]We pick off two or three more people, we're back in the game.
[64:11.12]I'm walking to lane.
[64:13.20]Wait, they're pushing you.
[64:16.73]Oh, I'm getting ganked too!
[64:19.23]I'm dead.
[64:22.91]I'm dead.
[64:24.23]I'm hooking him in.
[64:26.46]I got a complete new item.
[64:28.24]Kill this guy.
[64:28.66]Kill this guy.
[64:29.84]Kill this guy.
[64:30.22]I'm coming back.
[64:31.30]Collapse.
[64:31.56]Collapse.
[64:31.84]Collapse.
[64:32.12]I don't know what the hell that is.
[64:38.16]Nice.
[64:38.64]Very nice.
[64:39.50]Very nice.
[64:40.18]I just got a god kill.
[64:41.52]Just saying.
[64:43.13]Good job, man.
[64:44.43]Really pulling it back.
[64:45.25]This is a clutch plays we're talking about.
[64:46.83]Let's go.
[64:47.83]Let's go.
[64:48.69]No more arguments.
[64:49.45]We're good.
[64:53.27]We gotta get our hearts and heads in the game.
[64:55.99]And we're good to go.
[64:56.65]I need help with this Bologna.
[64:57.83]I'm coming.
[64:58.33]On my left.
[64:59.81]We might be able to... She's so strong for me though.
[65:01.33]Yeah, she's so strong in general.
[65:02.95]She's just tanky.
[65:03.61]She's just tanky.
[65:04.43]I can't really touch her.
[65:05.23]She's level 15.
[65:05.55]That was a good hook.
[65:08.49]You can hook people, Russell?
[65:09.73]Yeah.
[65:10.65]No, no, no.
[65:11.61]Only my ult.
[65:13.03]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:15.09]Usually I ult so that they can get sucked under tower and then we do all the damage.
[65:17.89]Like we zerg them.
[65:20.46]Oh, shit.
[65:24.37]I mean, I could try to fuck around here.
[65:26.09]I mean, it's a few.
[65:26.77]Yo, we should probably... I fucking missed my ult.
[65:29.87]I think we should back up, I think.
[65:33.09]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[65:33.93]Wait, I'm not with you.
[65:34.39]Yeah, back it up.
[65:34.77]Don't, don't, don't.
[65:35.27]Yeah, it's not worth it.
[65:36.11]That buff is almost coming up.
[65:38.15]Yeah, I know.
[65:38.65]I see it.
[65:38.97]How you guys doing?
[65:40.95]I'm in a mess right here.
[65:42.18]Oh, no, I'm not.
[65:43.08]I need help.
[65:44.54]Find him, find him, find him.
[65:47.78]Mid's missing.
[65:48.22]Yeah, mid's missing right now.
[65:49.78]Mid's missing.
[65:50.30]Careful right side.
[65:50.94]I can't move.
[65:51.82]I literally can't move.
[65:54.34]That was mid.
[65:54.92]Yeah, they're all here.
[65:55.94]They're all there.
[65:56.74]They're all three right side.
[65:59.52]Okay, now I understand.
[66:01.85]We just got to stop leaving safe areas.
[66:05.43]Oh, that's fucking huge.
[66:06.65]Go in, go in, go in.
[66:07.37]That's huge.
[66:08.05]Absolutely massive.
[66:11.41]Big.
[66:11.67]Big.
[66:14.89]That is so hot.
[66:17.03]Get her!
[66:17.37]Collapse, collapse, collapse.
[66:18.09]This is huge.
[66:19.44]We have Surefour.
[66:20.24]We ain't losing.
[66:22.28]Surefour, this is actually so hot.
[66:23.96]I'm not even kidding, bro.
[66:25.76]I think we forgot we have Surefour.
[66:27.42]Alright, back, back, back.
[66:28.84]Oh, this fucking dodgy.
[66:32.57]Alright, we're good.
[66:33.69]We pulled that back.
[66:34.31]That was clutch.
[66:35.79]We forgot.
[66:36.59]Just pull it back.
[66:37.91]Can you get the dodge?
[66:38.61]Yes!
[66:39.05]Get it off my screen.
[66:40.21]Yes, yes.
[66:43.74]Hey, guys.
[66:45.82]We're good.
[66:47.16]Push mid.
[66:48.64]We're good.
[66:50.36]We've gained back so much ground.
[66:52.80]Yep, good job.
[66:54.94]You too.
[66:55.88]Oh, I forgot to get the magic shell.
[66:59.41]I pushed mid tower as well.
[67:01.75]Our team is going to scale like crazy, by the way.
[67:06.69]What do I do in this scenario?
[67:09.49]I think at this point we have to just kind of be together.
[67:12.92]Okay.
[67:14.39]Alright, I'm going to actually wait for my Prydwen, or whatever it's called.
[67:17.57]We have to move as a unit.
[67:18.79]Okay, I got it.
[67:20.21]Fire Giant, is she scary?
[67:22.07]We could try to do Gold Fury.
[67:23.10]That's very scary.
[67:24.26]You want to try to go?
[67:24.88]Fire Giant Baron.
[67:25.60]Wait, where are you at?
[67:26.60]We're underleveled still compared to them, though.
[67:28.38]That's kind of scary.
[67:28.98]Wait, what about right side of map?
[67:31.92]They're going to push right side of map, though.
[67:33.16]They're pushing right side of map.
[67:36.50]How many are in right right now?
[67:40.52]We're so under leveled though.
[67:41.78]How many levels?
[67:43.16]How many?
[67:43.48]Thirteen.
[67:44.70]Well, he has three kills.
[67:48.22]We need camps, bro.
[67:49.12]I haven't died yet.
[67:50.78]Every time we get near camps... They just finished Pyro.
[67:54.32]Oh shit, that's scary.
[67:55.58]I'm coming over to you.
[67:57.97]I'm just trying to get away.
[67:58.65]Yeah, come to me, come to me, come to me.
[68:04.25]They're all here.
[68:06.66]What the fuck is going on on my screen?
[68:11.88]Get me the fuck out.
[68:13.94]Yeah, watch out, watch out.
[68:15.12]She's right in there.
[68:18.13]I'm just running away.
[68:19.01]Wait, should we just push?
[68:20.51]Yeah, I would just push the right lane.
[68:23.83]What just happened here?
[68:24.53]Oh, they're coming.
[68:25.43]Yeah, they're wrapping up, everyone.
[68:28.73]Yeah, you can just fall back.
[68:30.72]I'm leaving right side.
[68:31.90]I'm leaving right side.
[68:32.52]A lot of coming going on.
[68:34.97]You like that?
[68:35.77]Yeah.
[68:36.29]I like the view.
[68:38.05]Alright, you're here.
[68:40.17]Wait.
[68:40.59]I like this guy, because you guys are good.
[68:42.13]Maybe you could solo farm, and then I rotate.
[68:44.61]I can't.
[68:45.77]I'm dying every time.
[68:47.83]We should play really slow.
[68:50.83]All we have to do is make sure we have wards on Fire Giant.
[68:53.32]They never do that, and we're fine.
[68:55.18]What is god fury?
[68:56.64]Gold fury.
[68:58.06]It's dragon, basically.
[68:59.10]What is this?
[68:59.74]It's gone.
[69:00.82]It's gone, yeah.
[69:02.40]Let's fucking push this tower.
[69:03.46]We can kill this.
[69:07.79]Bologna's in mid.
[69:09.49]Bologna's the scariest of their whole team so far in the dodgy.
[69:11.59]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[69:13.29]Pushing hard.
[69:14.50]Yeah, you guys be careful.
[69:15.64]They're gonna collapse on you.
[69:17.06]We leave right away.
[69:17.70]Yeah, we leave right away.
[69:18.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[69:19.66]Cool.
[69:20.24]Oh god, of course I'm the slowest one.
[69:21.80]My buff is up.
[69:22.60]I'm so scared.
[69:27.22]Oh, don't be scared.
[69:28.14]They in mid right now?
[69:29.58]Yep.
[69:29.78]Let's collapse mid.
[69:30.84]Collapse mid.
[69:31.49]I have my ult.
[69:33.01]I'm coming.
[69:33.43]I'm coming.
[69:36.27]She used her ult on me.
[69:37.21]Who's their AD carry?
[69:37.83]What's their name?
[69:39.11]Freya.
[69:39.49]I'm ready.
[69:41.07]I'm ready.
[69:42.83]Let's go for it.
[69:47.37]I got one.
[69:49.49]No, I missed my ult.
[69:54.66]Don't let that Daji get away.
[69:56.98]I'm trying to fight the Bologna.
[70:00.22]Let's go.
[70:00.86]Let's go.
[70:03.02]Come here, boy.
[70:04.62]Oh.
[70:05.73]I got flash.
[70:10.07]There it is.
[70:10.49]There it is.
[70:10.97]And that's how you bring the goddamn game back.
[70:13.91]Let's get Goldfury.
[70:14.71]Goldfury.
[70:15.05]Goldfury.
[70:15.57]Goldfury is gone.
[70:16.33]The only thing we can get is a Fire Giant.
[70:18.07]Do you think we can do it?
[70:19.89]Should we do it?
[70:20.43]God.
[70:21.23]We got to do something, right?
[70:22.65]Yeah.
[70:23.25]Let's go.
[70:23.69]Let's go.
[70:23.89]Team captain, this is your kill.
[70:25.41]Let's get the pyro guy.
[70:26.35]It might be too late now.
[70:28.53]Oh, let's push tower.
[70:29.43]I don't know.
[70:29.83]I don't play this game.
[70:31.81]You have guides, motherfucker.
[70:35.25]Let's just push mid tower.
[70:36.45]I should have definitely bought, but it's fine.
[70:38.79]I don't understand.
[70:39.55]Oh my, why?
[70:41.75]Guys, the tower is... How many?
[70:46.01]How many?
[70:46.27]How many?
[70:46.81]Of course, bro.
[70:47.89]I hate that game.
[70:48.50]Alright, pull back.
[70:49.12]Pull back.
[70:49.42]Pull back.
[70:49.72]Pull back.
[70:50.04]Not worth it.
[70:50.44]They're all up.
[70:50.84]They're up.
[70:51.28]They're up.
[70:51.54]They're up.
[70:52.18]They're all up.
[70:53.94]That's her little lift ability.
[70:56.40]If you got money, spend it.
[70:57.92]Because we brought the game back.
[71:00.30]So, if you got money, spend it.
[71:03.07]Good stuff.
[71:05.43]Why can't I upgrade my sentinels?
[71:06.71]Does anyone know why?
[71:10.29]Is it maxed out?
[71:14.16]Is that your starter item?
[71:15.78]You gotta wait till level 20.
[71:18.28]That's the last thing that you're gonna upgrade.
[71:23.02]Yeah, that's the last item you're gonna upgrade.
[71:30.42]We're gonna scale really well here if we can keep this up.
[71:34.92]Wait, Hoke.
[71:37.76]Yo.
[71:39.40]Oh my god, I was so close.
[71:43.13]Are they going for Fire Giant?
[71:44.17]I'm here, I'm here.
[71:45.67]Let's fight it, let's fight it.
[71:48.45]I'm out there, I'm out there.
[71:56.76]Good, good, good.
[72:01.25]I see the Bologna.
[72:01.97]I'm coming.
[72:03.93]We can maybe Fire Giant.
[72:05.11]You saw this guy?
[72:05.73]Yeah, let's Fire Giant.
[72:06.35]Let's Fire Giant.
[72:06.75]Let's Fire Giant then.
[72:08.56]There's a lot of minions here.
[72:09.54]Hold on.
[72:12.06]We need to tank.
[72:12.94]Oh, boy.
[72:13.72]We're not all here.
[72:14.62]We're not all here.
[72:15.70]Alright, let's get it.
[72:17.28]Oh, my God.
[72:17.76]I'm going to die from the fucking Fire Giant.
[72:21.73]I got to get out of here.
[72:22.31]I'm going to die from Fire Giant.
[72:23.25]I have to leave.
[72:23.85]Get out.
[72:24.95]Okay.
[72:25.41]We can't.
[72:25.77]We can't.
[72:26.61]We can't.
[72:28.59]Well, it's not that we're not strong, it's this Fire Giant.
[72:32.87]We need a tank to take the hits, though.
[72:34.77]Oh, is it me?
[72:36.81]I'm dumb then.
[72:37.61]Sorry, but our right side is being pushed, so I can't.
[72:41.27]Yeah, I'm fucking one HP.
[72:42.81]It's like hard.
[72:43.63]There's also a ward beside all of you.
[72:47.21]We took the lead here.
[72:49.39]Oh, I almost died.
[72:51.63]No.
[72:52.53]I'm pushing right.
[72:52.95]I'm going to come right side.
[72:57.67]They might be thinking to do fire.
[73:00.69]I'll be there in a second.
[73:02.73]Yeah, they have Bologna.
[73:03.59]I've got two right sides.
[73:04.83]They are going to take it.
[73:06.27]Yeah, they're taking it.
[73:07.55]Go, go, go.
[73:08.17]Let's go.
[73:08.58]Me and you.
[73:08.98]No, they're doing the firemancer guy.
[73:11.12]Oh, they're doing the firemancer?
[73:12.76]Oh, wait.
[73:12.98]I shouldn't help you.
[73:15.16]I'm going to go buy it.
[73:17.12]What do we do about that?
[73:21.28]We're nothing.
[73:23.16]We probably... 2020 Hindsight?
[73:25.04]Yeah, let's get it over with.
[73:26.58]We probably should have killed the Pyromancer.
[73:28.14]2020 Hindsight there.
[73:29.22]Healing hard right now.
[73:32.24]I'm going to push right side.
[73:34.95]Still have no gold.
[73:35.75]How?
[73:37.21]They're right here.
[73:39.19]Watch mid.
[73:39.59]I'm with you, brother.
[73:43.01]I think they got two or three here.
[73:43.87]Yeah, watch it.
[73:44.73]Yeah, let's back off.
[73:46.09]Well, I'm full build right now.
[73:48.47]They're all in this right side here.
[73:50.88]I wish I had a ward.
[73:51.56]I'm going to be honest, I'm nowhere close to my full build.
[73:54.36]Well, if there's a power site, it'd be now for me.
[73:58.00]Can we do this Primal Fury thing?
[73:59.60]Wait, wait.
[73:59.90]No, no, no.
[74:00.50]There were people literally just seen over here.
[74:02.08]They're going to do fire.
[74:03.45]We can fuck with this.
[74:04.75]I think they're doing it right now.
[74:06.29]Let's go.
[74:06.83]Let's fuck with it.
[74:07.41]I'm coming.
[74:08.57]I'm just going to go in there and just kamikaze it.
[74:11.31]I'm behind poke.
[74:12.29]Okay, it's already dead.
[74:13.23]It's dead?
[74:13.55]Shit.
[74:13.87]What about the Primal Fury then?
[74:15.17]Can we kill the Primal Fury?
[74:17.30]They're coming in real hard.
[74:19.26]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[74:21.18]We have to play very defensive.
[74:24.01]We have to play very defensive.
[74:26.91]I just got fucking... Shit.
[74:31.07]Oh, I just flashed into it.
[74:32.09]I thought they were on the other side.
[74:35.26]Oh no.
[74:35.70]Ooh, that was fucking big!
[74:37.74]That was actually huge!
[74:44.76]Oh, damn it!
[74:46.13]No, no.
[74:47.39]They're all low.
[74:48.39]I saw a red person.
[74:50.25]They can't push because I'm alive.
[74:53.77]Okay.
[74:55.25]I think they're doing gold theory now.
[74:56.81]I was trying to feed you, Surefour.
[74:58.99]I'm already full build.
[75:01.09]There's no more feeding.
[75:02.31]Oh, yeah.
[75:03.61]I'm fucked.
[75:05.13]I feel like I don't do damage.
[75:06.34]I should have just pulled back.
[75:08.48]My nerves are too high.
[75:09.60]It's okay.
[75:10.64]It's okay.
[75:11.46]Just relax.
[75:12.54]That's right.
[75:14.47]Alright.
[75:15.71]We got to start winning team fights.
[75:17.55]That's the only way.
[75:18.55]Well, we've won every single team fight so far.
[75:21.54]Yeah, from this part going forward.
[75:30.44]I'm just going to stay next to you, Surefour, to be honest.
[75:33.17]Honestly, I can also solo push left.
[75:35.85]Hard.
[75:36.53]But I don't TP.
[75:37.01]I'm going to let you solo push right side maybe.
[75:39.83]I'm going to try to get this buff right here.
[75:41.74]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[75:42.50]I wouldn't do that.
[75:43.10]Oh, wait.
[75:43.42]That buff.
[75:43.82]Okay, never mind.
[75:44.48]Well, Freya is somewhere near, just saying, so watch out.
[75:47.00]But I am kind of hidden back here.
[75:49.22]When does their Fire Giant run out?
[75:51.72]It's like four minutes that they have it or something.
[75:54.54]Yeah, it's a long time.
[75:56.40]I mean, they haven't gotten anything from it yet.
[75:58.19]Make sure you're buying wards if you have extra gold as well.
[76:01.57]There are two right side.
[76:02.79]They're ganking me.
[76:03.31]They're ganking me.
[76:04.47]Yeah, I'm getting ganked, brother.
[76:06.31]Hit the tower.
[76:06.81]Hit the tower.
[76:12.24]Are they all down?
[76:14.38]They were in the fucking jungle.
[76:16.14]Oh, he's getting caught out.
[76:19.31]Oh, shit.
[76:19.67]They're all here, yeah.
[76:21.37]They're all pushing me hard.
[76:24.95]They can't really push if I'm at the tower.
[76:27.25]I'm going to try to push mid and just like... Yeah, I'm not sure what the play here is.
[76:36.21]We just have to wait until they mess up, really.
[76:39.33]Damn, you do so much damage.
[76:40.45]You have a stun?
[76:41.52]No.
[76:43.34]I'm going left side.
[76:44.80]I can fight the Deja.
[76:45.52]I'm going to wait in the jungle because she's probably going to dash through.
[77:06.26]I'm coming, guys.
[77:06.78]I'm trying to get there.
[77:07.38]Did you get out?
[77:08.56]My ult's up and I flash.
[77:09.64]My ult's up and I flash.
[77:10.78]I didn't know the command.
[77:11.80]I can help you guys.
[77:13.51]I thought she was going to dash in the jungle and get away.
[77:15.19]Turn when I'm there.
[77:16.17]I got her there.
[77:16.61]They're already gone.
[77:17.95]Oh, fuck.
[77:18.73]I thought that she was going to jump into the jungle to get away from you.
[77:21.63]No.
[77:22.19]But I killed her, though.
[77:23.93]Okay, good, good, good.
[77:30.21]I was waiting for the escape.
[77:31.49]XP camp up.
[77:33.83]Is everybody at 20?
[77:34.21]Sweetie?
[77:38.53]And they're doing the obelisk shit, too.
[77:40.35]Damn it.
[77:41.99]They just got objectives right now.
[77:44.99]Like, hard.
[77:45.79]Yeah.
[77:46.41]We need to do objectives.
[77:47.83]I think we got to kind of group up at this point.
[77:50.13]Yeah, I think we group up for sure.
[77:51.79]I think we're ready for a team fight.
[77:53.47]I think we actually have to, like, death ball the lane.
[77:55.03]Dude, you're so fast.
[78:00.14]I know.
[78:00.50]Speed buff.
[78:03.85]I'm kind of scared to go with you because if I go with you, then I can't leave you.
[78:07.01]Yeah.
[78:07.81]I can get out and I can't.
[78:08.93]Are they doing... Is Fire Giant back up?
[78:10.47]They're not doing that again, are they?
[78:12.17]No.
[78:12.63]It's not up yet.
[78:14.05]I mean, you can wait for one more item for my Power Swag and then I get Deathbringer.
[78:18.32]Yeah, I got to complete my last item.
[78:21.40]I'm going for my buff right side.
[78:22.28]I might get killed here.
[78:25.40]Burped.
[78:25.68]I'm just going to push left.
[78:28.74]It's dead.
[78:29.12]Never mind.
[78:31.71]You can hear the sadness in his voice.
[78:35.55]How long did this last?
[78:36.21]Oh, okay.
[78:37.81]Well, their fire buff has been gone.
[78:40.13]Yeah.
[78:40.99]I'm so scared to sit inside jungle, so I'm just going to chill.
[78:44.21]Come push with me.
[78:44.71]Okay.
[78:46.25]Well, right now they're just waiting to gank.
[78:48.69]Yeah, I was going to say, that's why I feel like we shouldn't push.
[78:50.85]Freya was left side.
[78:52.17]Yeah, they're doing the pyromancer.
[78:56.97]Fuck.
[78:57.35]I don't know if Giant's up or not.
[79:00.30]Because we don't have a ward.
[79:01.91]They're all on left side, I think.
[79:13.97]I don't know the timings for when these objectives are up.
[79:17.39]Usually, as long as you have a ward or vision on them, you can see.
[79:21.28]I think I was muted, sorry.
[79:23.04]That's fine.
[79:24.48]They're all probably just right here, right?
[79:28.73]I think we have to go in.
[79:29.53]We have to go in.
[79:30.83]Go in, go in.
[79:32.57]I'm ulting them, ulting them, ulting them.
[79:34.23]Two on my ult, two on my ult.
[79:38.09]This is a big deal if we can get this.
[79:39.36]This is a huge deal.
[79:39.88]Oh boy!
[79:40.24]Alright, that's big.
[79:41.08]That's a big deal.
[79:42.02]Big deal.
[79:50.51]Did we they won't be able to finish fired they can't get fired that's right, okay, so that was a 45 so it's fine I Sell desk toll and I make Invent and Venoms or something oh No, oh shit, I have to yeah, I have to upgrade my last night hole you can upgrade it
[80:16.99]Defend left side Phoenix.
[80:17.93]They're trying to push Phoenix.
[80:19.40]Got it.
[80:20.88]Yeah, that's the last item you upgrade.
[80:22.54]What's happening on the right?
[80:23.76]Shit, I didn't upgrade mine.
[80:27.02]I mean, that's a catapult.
[80:27.90]We just have to deal with that later.
[80:29.14]Oh, okay.
[80:31.50]It destroys their towers, but Phoenix is more important.
[80:34.64]I'll be full.
[80:35.28]They're trying to like... Did she use her ult?
[80:40.74]Yeah.
[80:43.06]Yeah, I'm waiting 10 seconds or so.
[80:44.32]Should I push right side alone?
[80:47.22]Yeah, head right side.
[80:48.36]They're all on the left side.
[80:49.54]5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[80:49.64]Come on.
[80:49.94]I'll come right side, I guess.
[81:10.77]Are there any objectives up that we need to worry about?
[81:13.63]We could try Goldfury.
[81:16.52]Goldfury is not even worth doing right now.
[81:18.10]Everyone's pretty much full.
[81:19.70]Well, every fight's going to be around the left side of the map right now.
[81:23.80]We just need wards on it.
[81:25.40]Then we should just push out right side a little bit and then just maybe everybody control left.
[81:30.33]I'm going to base real quick and get my envenomed shit.
[81:33.99]Yeah, I need to eat some stuff.
[81:36.95]Who's that?
[81:37.85]Potion.
[81:43.59]They're on mid.
[81:43.93]Freya's pushing mid.
[81:45.93]Freya and someone else.
[81:46.70]Actually, Freya just went left side camp.
[81:48.30]Or left side jungle.
[81:48.94]He did go left side.
[81:49.52]Careful, careful.
[81:50.08]Whoever's left.
[81:50.76]I'm out.
[81:52.06]I'm out.
[81:56.60]Could they be on anything on the left side of the map?
[81:59.79]I'm trying to get close to giant.
[82:01.19]I need XP.
[82:01.69]I need XP.
[82:06.97]We need to get close to giant so I can put a ward.
[82:08.84]Oh, they're doing it right now.
[82:11.66]Oh, shit.
[82:12.64]No, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[82:15.10]Oh, shit.
[82:16.44]I thought I could trap and run.
[82:18.62]Oh, my God.
[82:19.01]I'm stupid.
[82:20.63]Oh, God.
[82:21.33]They're coming.
[82:22.45]They're coming.
[82:23.17]Play the towers.
[82:24.01]Play the towers.
[82:24.53]Yeah, just stay in tower.
[82:26.15]What one shot me?
[82:27.14]Oh my god.
[82:28.16]You got pulled in by her ult.
[82:29.92]I'd be pretty strong.
[82:30.88]We're pretty strong.
[82:31.54]They can't like... Yo, if they push, I'm just going to ult because I can just... They have to tower dive against me or else they can't really push.
[82:37.50]Dead for a minute.
[82:39.42]Oh my god.
[82:40.10]That's a long countdown.
[82:45.52]We gotta keep track of them.
[82:48.38]You could.
[82:49.10]You could do it.
[82:50.06]We don't need to force a fight.
[82:52.24]They have Fire Giant.
[82:53.00]No, but if I suck them under the tower, that's an easy win.
[82:58.02]They're all going to have beads.
[82:59.40]I'm imagining they're probably all going to use it.
[83:01.36]Yeah, left side of the map is being pushed.
[83:02.68]Yeah, they're going to split push.
[83:05.62]I'll go left.
[83:06.02]I need to eat some more minions.
[83:07.43]I need to eat some minions.
[83:19.63]Alright.
[83:20.55]Left is pretty empty.
[83:22.49]There's four mid right now.
[83:23.35]Yeah.
[83:24.88]Going back mid.
[83:31.70]We should know how long their buff was.
[83:40.14]I don't see anybody over here.
[83:40.98]Are they still four in mid?
[83:43.34]Yeah.
[83:43.48]I don't know where they went.
[83:45.64]They're probably just seeing full series of shit.
[83:47.60]Yeah.
[83:48.50]Oni Fury.
[83:50.45]oh they're gonna get gil fury alright alright now we gotta we gotta think about making a move here whatever it is we have to just wait until it's off yep they're going right side we can can we hyper push left wait I might be yeah we could try you could try to get the tower and left
[84:12.63]How many?
[84:13.09]Are they all on right side?
[84:14.67]Yeah, they're alright.
[84:15.43]Push, push, push left.
[84:16.48]Yeah, I think they're going for a win here.
[84:18.16]They're going for a win.
[84:19.36]They're trying to end the game.
[84:20.32]Okay, I'm dead.
[84:21.06]Yeah, they're trying to end the game right now.
[84:23.58]That's very all down.
[84:39.79]I was just terrified and I just fucking pressed that button They bet they get it back up though they're backing I'm pushing this Oh God Oh No
[85:08.51]Oh, he can do that.
[85:09.60]Oh, God.
[85:11.34]Oh, guys.
[85:13.44]Oh, God.
[85:17.00]Wow, they can just tower dive.
[85:20.33]They didn't necessarily tower dive.
[85:23.71]Yikes.
[85:24.49]I'm up in six seconds.
[85:26.71]Oh, fuck, I'm dead.
[85:27.85]I think this is it.
[85:29.40]I think this is it.
[85:30.40]Yeah, that's a gas fire game.
[85:33.35]We'll see if I can clutch out or not.
[85:34.73]Hey, hey, hey.
[85:35.65]Listen, listen.
[85:39.34]This was the team to beat, by the way.
[85:40.90]That's what we've been told.
[85:42.06]This was the team.
[85:44.90]No, he didn't say this was the team to beat.
[85:47.40]Oh.
[85:48.38]He said it was one of the strongest ones.
[85:50.77]Oh.
[85:54.31]I used my beads, but it didn't work.
[85:56.03]It didn't get me out of the swirly.
[85:59.75]Some species you can't get out of, I'm pretty sure.
[86:02.83]I genuinely think my biggest problem is knowing positioning.
[86:07.52]I got caught out so many times early game.
[86:10.58]That was our warm-up game.
[86:12.08]I think we did good, though.
[86:13.30]I mean, come on.
[86:14.88]I think that was a good show.
[86:15.76]I think that was a good showing.
[86:17.44]We lost a want-up, dude.
[86:21.74]Yes, you did.
[86:22.56]You did better than I thought you would after that start.
[86:24.88]I get kind of shit on, but it's alright.
[86:28.44]You guys got a... I know it's hard.
[86:29.80]The bead.
[86:30.20]None of you are beads-ing.
[86:31.60]Like you use your beads so you don't get CC'd.
[86:33.98]What is beads?
[86:35.54]That's your... Yeah, you use that... What do those do?
[86:39.40]Before you get CC'd.
[86:40.96]So like that dude would go up on the totem thing and change you.
[86:43.40]That's when you would bead so he wouldn't pull you.
[86:45.30]Look at your first player damage.
[86:46.68]Got it.
[86:48.15]How much damage did I do?
[86:48.85]Did I do a lot?
[86:49.49]Probably not a lot.
[86:49.95]I did nothing.
[86:51.05]I needed to do more, too.
[86:51.75]If Russell showed up to practice last night, we would have won.
[86:57.21]We had a team practice yesterday, and we could have been on the same page.
[87:01.16]No, I'm just kidding.
[87:02.00]Nobody told me.
[87:03.20]Dude.
[87:05.37]I didn't know you guys were looking at the OTK shows chat, okay?
[87:09.55]I would have expected Poke to DM me on Twitter and be like, yo, dude, we're practicing right now.
[87:14.54]And I'm like, oh, shoot, let's go practice.
[87:16.40]Do you guys have pings disabled on Discord?
[87:19.18]Yeah, I have everything disabled on Discord.
[87:20.72]You're relying on the most lazy guy on the team?
[87:24.68]Yeah.
[87:25.36]You know me.
[87:27.04]Yeah.
[87:29.26]I think we did good, though.
[87:31.06]That was a good showing.
[87:32.00]You guys are
[87:33.94]Your next game should be easier.
[87:35.02]So you need to win your last game.
[87:36.54]And your last game is going to be your... You guys need to step up again.
[87:39.33]Alright.
[87:41.53]But yeah, start early.
[87:43.19]Like the start of the game, Russell takes the green buff.
[87:46.71]That was a mistake.
[87:48.15]Yeah, I know.
[87:49.35]And then I'll... Shall Russell be more aggressive in lane?
[87:51.95]Yeah.
[87:52.29]You need to start your three, Russell.
[87:54.01]What's my first item?
[87:55.00]Oh, I should start my three?
[87:56.22]Two pots.
[87:59.35]Uh, three pots, one multi-pot.
[88:01.84]Or you, you do all potions.
[88:03.04]Yeah, that's all you need is potions.
[88:04.58]And then... Transcendence, you'll finish.
[88:06.98]It's a Morningstar.
[88:07.78]It's the tier one item.
[88:09.04]But you'll go Transcendence.
[88:10.03]I'll type it out again, like... No, no, I see it.
[88:12.15]It's Death Toll.
[88:13.63]Yeah.
[88:13.87]Then I get Transcendence.
[88:15.19]Yes.
[88:16.89]Or whatever item that... You have, yeah, yeah.
[88:19.17]Alright, I can see you guys again.
[88:21.12]We tried.
[88:22.02]We tried.
[88:23.52]I needed that warm-up, though.
[88:26.12]They were a good team.
[88:27.42]We gotta be better about trying to get the objectives, too, though.
[88:29.96]It's just like, oh, Fire Giant!
[88:31.30]Oh, fuck!
[88:34.98]That was fun.
[88:35.56]This game's fun.
[88:36.24]I just gotta be better at it.
[88:44.05]We pulled that back.
[88:45.39]I'm very proud of this team.
[88:47.35]They're dead, then you can start fucking around.
[88:49.04]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[88:50.14]Got it.
[88:51.38]I'll have the phone call my mom.
[88:53.52]Oh, you gotta answer.
[88:54.92]Hi, Mom!
[89:03.45]Am I gonna play Anubis?
[89:05.07]No.
[89:08.33]Yeah, I think I'm gonna stick to Ares.
[89:10.47]I think that's the play.
[89:13.24]Definitely don't think I'm gonna learn anything else.
[89:19.92]Alright, I retyped out Urals.
[89:22.16]Both you and Pokes full build.
[89:24.56]In that order.
[89:32.52]Got it.
[89:33.65]So, the next game we're going against... Is it Emeru's team?
[89:40.35]I believe so.
[89:40.89]I don't know what their full thing is.
[89:45.05]Are there bans in the finals?
[89:46.70]Yes.
[89:48.08]Oh no.
[89:52.61]So you're telling me if they ban my champion, I have to learn a whole new one?
[89:56.15]Yeah.
[89:57.21]Well, we have to get to the finals first.
[89:59.15]That is true.
[90:00.09]But we are going to get to the finals.
[90:01.77]I think we're going to get to the finals.
[90:03.09]We're definitely going to get to the finals.
[90:04.06]Which mid do you think I should play?
[90:05.54]You kind of destroyed on the... I mean, you had like 50,000 player damage.
[90:10.66]Yeah, no, you should definitely do whatever you did.
[90:13.02]Do that again.
[90:13.74]You were your own team.
[90:15.38]I was wondering if there's something that has me more pressure.
[90:18.09]No, what you were doing was, like, perfect, and I don't think hair would be any different.
[90:21.83]You guys should have won the game.
[90:22.83]When you killed everybody and Russell wasn't right, sorry, Russell, but you fucked them.
[90:27.42]Oh, yeah, when we killed on fire, you won the game.
[90:29.30]You literally won the game off of it.
[90:31.02]Wait, what happened?
[90:32.42]When you were in right and they want to fight and want to do fire, you were like, your character is be in front of everybody, start every fight, be at every fight, never be by yourself.
[90:40.83]Yeah.
[90:41.63]Alright.
[90:42.23]That is good to know.
[90:43.29]That is very good to know.
[90:44.48]You should die first.
[90:45.46]You should be like the first one to die.
[90:46.48]What character can he play that he has to like stay behind everybody and do nothing?
[90:50.48]No, no, no.
[90:51.82]I don't want to play any other character.
[90:53.28]Ares is definitely the one.
[90:54.28]Trust, trust, trust.
[90:56.66]There's got to be a character he can play that he does nothing on.
[90:59.20]No, no, no.
[90:59.84]On Ares, if you start your three instead of your one, he'll do what you want him to do in lane.
[91:05.18]I'm joking.
[91:06.96]I mean, we can trade lanes too.
[91:08.62]Can I AD carry in the lane and work with...
[91:11.98]No, we're fine.
[91:12.58]We just fucked up early.
[91:14.40]I mean, if I'm being completely honest, my Artemis fucking sucked.
[91:17.05]Okay, look at the damage.
[91:18.11]I mean, it's true.
[91:19.35]Yeah, because I had no one to fucking support me.
[91:22.41]That's also true.
[91:23.03]Uh-oh, maybe we should change.
[91:24.81]Maybe we should do it.
[91:25.71]You should support my fucking finger in your ass.
[91:28.05]You guys are at each other's throats.
[91:33.74]Really?
[91:34.02]We like it.
[91:35.38]This is nothing compared to what some Apex players say to each other.
[91:38.60]That is true.
[91:41.97]Make sure you guys have cool avatars, too, because that's important.
[91:45.51]Sure, I had the skin buff.
[91:48.13]Should I play Ullr in this game?
[91:50.99]Didn't you not like Ullr?
[91:52.81]I feel like you were saying, I don't like this.
[91:54.33]I liked Ullr, I just didn't like the third guy I played, the ninja character.
[91:57.47]Oh, okay.
[91:59.06]Yeah.
[91:59.20]Alright, we get a fresh start.
[92:02.98]Ullr's too hard.
[92:04.08]No, he's not.
[92:05.88]He's not hard.
[92:08.56]I just think I wasn't impactful enough to be honest.
[92:10.44]And that's also how top works.
[92:11.38]You're on an island for the most part.
[92:13.16]Did I get an F on my report card, Wigan?
[92:28.08]So pretty much I should just farm.
[92:30.04]Like a D. I missed some of your plays.
[92:35.32]So you did some stuff right.
[92:36.20]Like when you guys traded, you and NoCo killed a guy and left.
[92:38.82]And NoCo died.
[92:39.30]That's fine.
[92:39.76]Like he had fire so that was good.
[92:41.03]Okay.
[92:42.70]Basically, all you're doing is trying to alpha your laner, and if you've ever alphaed them, you steal all the camps around you.
[92:50.58]The other thing, Pogue, if you play Artemis, your ultimate is the same as B's.
[92:54.68]They can't CC you or anything.
[92:56.52]Yeah, I realized that too late.
[92:58.24]Yeah, you can just ult.
[92:59.70]Same for you, Jerma.
[93:00.78]Your ult will make you CC immune.
[93:02.70]Really?
[93:03.16]I didn't know that.
[93:03.70]You can just ult, and then it'll help you get away.
[93:07.94]Your W makes you move faster, and you attack faster.
[93:10.81]Does it remove slows and shit or no?
[93:12.37]It might, yeah.
[93:12.99]It might remove slows.
[93:15.15]It shouldn't matter if you're ulting in any way.
[93:19.12]You'll be CC immune to everything.
[93:23.34]Lenses slows and becomes immune to slows.
[93:27.04]Yeah, when you want to do fire too, you four could have done it.
[93:30.09]You just needed whoever was healthiest to pull it.
[93:33.39]Just pulling better than most.
[93:36.35]Alright.
[93:38.01]We got a game.
[93:39.67]Someone else should have pulled it.
[93:40.63]Anyone but you.
[93:41.19]Pretty much.
[93:42.09]We got a game here.
[93:43.11]I did pull it, right?
[93:44.41]I think you did.
[93:44.99]And then you guys reset it anyways.
[93:46.21]It opened to me first though.
[93:47.40]If you guys are like not sure, just do whatever's up.
[93:49.48]Like if that pyromancer's up, do that instead or do gold.
[93:52.22]Just do something.
[93:53.24]It doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're doing something.
[93:57.06]I'm pulling us into the game.
[93:57.84]You guys good?
[93:59.08]Yep.
[93:59.30]Ready to go.
[93:59.78]Let's go.
[94:00.60]I am good and ready, baby.
[94:02.96]I've listened to what we can have said and I am going to apply that knowledge to this game.
[94:10.86]Same.
[94:11.10]I feel like Surefour, I'm just going to farm.
[94:14.63]I'm going to get super strong.
[94:16.39]Why are you on the other team?
[94:18.65]He can swap.
[94:23.81]Wait, how do I swap?
[94:25.59]It says I'm in your party.
[94:27.36]Yeah, you're in our party.
[94:28.68]No, they'll swap.
[94:31.64]Close the shit you're in right now, Noca.
[94:34.44]And click at the top of the number.
[94:35.58]Click the number at the top.
[94:37.00]The countdown.
[94:37.66]Or count up.
[94:38.72]Click on it.
[94:40.20]Okay.
[94:40.78]At the top middle.
[94:41.46]Just click on the actual number.
[94:42.78]Yeah, just click on that.
[94:43.56]And then hit a little refresh.
[94:45.65]Click the refresh button.
[94:47.11]It'll move you.
[94:47.47]There you go.
[94:48.97]You guys should turn my game volume up.
[94:51.53]You guys should do shit on this team.
[94:53.53]Like, you should actually just dumpster this team.
[94:55.75]You are giving me the confidence that I needed.
[94:58.33]That's what we like to hear.
[94:59.16]We want to see some five-man air results from you.
[95:01.56]I know.
[95:02.58]You made some nutty plays in duo.
[95:04.63]You guys have some crazy turns.
[95:06.01]I was feeling the nutty plays.
[95:07.35]Honestly, I was actually feeling them.
[95:09.24]I had the nutty plays, but then I would get caught out.
[95:11.20]And then I also wouldn't be in front of poke, which is another problem.
[95:14.44]And I'm going to fix all these problems.
[95:15.68]When it's really late, like you guys are kind of like, what do we do?
[95:18.08]You're running around.
[95:18.70]You need to put some wards down and you need to make sure they just don't do fire.
[95:22.10]Like fight them no matter what.
[95:24.06]Yeah.
[95:24.26]I'm going to try to just, this time I'm going to try to have a ward at Fire Giant from like five, 10 minutes forward.
[95:30.25]If you get a chance, if you're that deep, put them on their side of the map on fire.
[95:34.29]Yeah.
[95:34.61]You need one on the fire and the rest just on their side.
[95:36.83]So you know where they are.
[95:37.88]yeah also um with awards right it says upgrade your ward is that when you get the magic shell or what those are upgrade your your relics you can make them better um so yeah like late game once you have your full build upgrade whatever you want okay so then how do I get more awards you just buy them they just they're 50 gold and then there's a bigger one that's 120. oh okay the bigger one is the pink word that's invisible
[96:02.41]In the early game, if you think about it, grab a single 50 gold ward.
[96:06.31]If you don't, just in the late game is where like when you guys were grouped, like what the fuck do we do?
[96:10.15]Where are they on this?
[96:10.83]That's when you have to start warding.
[96:12.13]Yep.
[96:12.53]Okay.
[96:13.59]And if you never know what to ward, usually just ward Goldfury and Fire Giant.
[96:18.12]And then after that, just put it in random spots.
[96:20.40]Yeah.
[96:20.88]That's actually all it needs to do.
[96:22.48]Okay.
[96:23.52]Do you know how to go away if you get hit?
[96:26.26]No.
[96:26.82]They'll keep ticking.
[96:28.95]Yeah.
[96:29.09]If you start a fight, pop them.
[96:30.39]Like... I can't press my beads when I'm stunned.
[96:33.22]Yes, you can.
[96:34.24]Okay.
[96:34.56]And then what about my Aegis?
[96:35.44]Do I press my E plus my Aegis, basically?
[96:37.74]Your Aegis, you want to use to not take damage.
[96:39.94]So like if everyone's jumping on you or fucking you up, you want to use that.
[96:43.02]But you cannot use that when you're CC'd.
[96:47.11]Oh.
[96:47.29]So what if I E and G, basically?
[96:49.61]Yeah.
[96:49.75]If you can beads and then Aegis.
[96:51.07]Yeah.
[96:51.29]If you need to.
[96:52.05]Or if you just know the damage is about to come, you can just pop the Aegis.
[96:55.75]Got you.
[96:58.30]That's actually super smart.
[96:59.92]And then I can, but I can't cast abilities.
[97:02.46]Not in the Aegis with the beads you can.
[97:04.93]You beads, you're like ready to fuck them up.
[97:06.61]Like you pop that and just turn and start fucking whaling on them.
[97:09.29]Beads is like BKB.
[97:11.19]And the beads will last a couple seconds.
[97:12.97]It's two seconds, yep.
[97:14.43]Somebody said your fly is down.
[97:16.33]I don't have any clothes on.
[97:17.46]That's impossible.
[97:18.66]Huh?
[97:19.94]You're naked?
[97:22.18]Oh, right.
[97:22.98]I forgot I'm going to call everybody.
[97:25.24]You didn't tell us that you were naked.
[97:26.70]Is that what we're all supposed to be playing like so we can play better?
[97:29.45]Yo, turn on the webcam.
[97:31.35]Stand up.
[97:32.11]Stand up.
[97:33.43]Look at this team synergy they have.
[97:34.81]They all have fucking the sad Pepe face.
[97:37.67]Yeah, because that's going to be them when they lost.
[97:39.67]Yeah.
[97:41.21]True.
[97:41.41]Dude.
[97:42.36]True for.
[97:43.00]That's a fact.
[97:43.90]True for.
[97:45.06]I'm a god.
[97:48.86]Hold on a sec.
[97:49.72]What do we press play?
[97:51.72]Hold on a second.
[97:53.69]Guys, I'm opening up chests so I can get this skin real quick.
[97:58.31]You need the $100 skin.
[98:01.21]This skin is going to be big.
[98:02.47]$100 skin.
[98:05.11]Or bust.
[98:09.49]Keep going.
[98:11.00]I just got... Hold on.
[98:12.60]Wait, is that Sancho bees?
[98:14.10]What's wrong, Jerma?
[98:15.14]What's wrong, Team Captain?
[98:16.48]Um... Hold on.
[98:18.42]If we have time, there's something that I... Team Captain?
[98:21.41]Team Captain has something to potentially show.
[98:24.33]Oh, no.
[98:24.73]Team Captain can't do it.
[98:26.21]You're gonna show it, huh?
[98:27.67]My girlfriend took a picture of me when I was sitting here.
[98:31.09]I'm fucking naked.
[98:34.71]I got it!
[98:35.17]I got it!
[98:36.27]Alright, what's going on here?
[98:39.05]I got the skin.
[98:39.73]I was banning.
[98:41.63]Banning?
[98:42.25]Wait.
[98:43.52]Huh?
[98:43.60]What?
[98:44.52]They got the rule wrong.
[98:46.36]Pass ban.
[98:46.80]I'm just gonna pass ban.
[98:48.98]That's what they're doing.
[98:50.26]I think they're just passing.
[98:51.82]Oh, okay.
[98:52.12]Oh my god.
[98:53.94]Now we're picking.
[98:54.92]No, there's no bans.
[98:55.70]They got the settings wrong.
[98:56.80]Oh, okay.
[98:58.74]Can I even show this?
[99:01.96]Artemis or Ullr.
[99:03.28]Hey, stay tuned for next game when I show a picture of something funny.
[99:10.03]Can I frag out as Ullr?
[99:12.67]I have to sneeze.
[99:16.34]I feel like I'm just kind of weak because I... Yeah, I throw the axe and... You kind of need to be confident in Russell to play well.
[99:24.54]I got to focus right now.
[99:25.70]Okay, chat's going down.
[99:26.82]I'll show it.
[99:27.84]I'll show it next game.
[99:28.84]You got to do what for me?
[99:30.41]I can't see chat anymore.
[99:32.31]He needs to be confident in you to play well.
[99:35.61]I am extremely confident that I will play well here because I just opened up a skin and it's over.
[99:41.45]It's GG's.
[99:43.63]Same.
[99:45.75]You got the cat ears?
[99:47.59]No.
[99:47.93]Never mind.
[99:48.55]That's pokes.
[99:49.15]Never mind.
[99:49.45]I got the hired gun Aries.
[99:52.57]What?
[99:53.35]It was a 1 in 120 chance of getting it.
[99:58.84]So their first character they picked is their jungler?
[100:01.80]He has an ability that makes him not take any damage, and then he has three damaging abilities that are all just abilities.
[100:06.98]Thanatos.
[100:07.94]Thanatos where?
[100:09.76]Solo?
[100:11.14]Probably jungle.
[100:13.12]Is there a loser bracket?
[100:17.40]I don't think so.
[100:19.90]So we can't get first anymore?
[100:21.38]Basically, we have to come out of this 2-2.
[100:29.39]Minimum you need to win the next game.
[100:30.67]So between yeah, when it's it yeah two and one and then we play semi-finals, right?
[100:39.58]I think it should be semis and then finals Okay, that Amazon cabs should be in the adc lane against you guys Your a result will bop them if his be like he beads are his only way of getting out of it
[100:55.60]Pass the ban.
[100:56.78]My Ares ult.
[100:57.44]What?
[100:58.08]Sorry.
[100:58.62]We'll fuck up the Amuzen Cab.
[101:00.22]Their second pick.
[101:01.77]He doesn't have any way to get out of your ult other than his beats.
[101:04.19]Okay.
[101:04.37]Amuzen Cab.
[101:06.03]That's the one with the bees you told me about.
[101:07.69]Yep.
[101:07.85]He has bees.
[101:08.55]Yep.
[101:09.43]And that's who I'm playing against.
[101:11.57]No, no.
[101:11.83]I think you're going to be against the Ravana, the first character.
[101:15.27]Ravana.
[101:16.11]He's a melee character.
[101:17.55]He's got a root, a slow, and a leap that slams on you.
[101:21.13]I'm going to piss on him.
[101:25.11]What?
[101:29.12]Alright.
[101:30.18]Guys, let's do a little pep talk here.
[101:33.88]Everybody, just try to do your best.
[101:38.10]If you don't do your best, then fuck you.
[101:41.63]Can you sing the song for me?
[101:44.59]You want to sing that?
[101:46.11]Yeah, sing the song.
[101:49.03]Try your best.
[101:50.61]Do your best.
[101:51.78]Wait, what?
[101:54.18]The song.
[101:55.20]Wait, what happened?
[101:56.76]They didn't make a selection, so...
[102:02.44]They were power gaming.
[102:06.37]We got to pick quicker than that.
[102:08.99]I didn't do it.
[102:10.25]Is that lobby still up?
[102:11.27]Am I supposed to be seeing a screen right now?
[102:12.83]Because I'm not seeing a screen.
[102:14.27]We should have an automatic win.
[102:19.93]That's unacceptable.
[102:21.27]They're wasting everybody's time.
[102:23.75]Yeah, give us that dove.
[102:25.11]Report them.
[102:30.02]We should get a thousand extra gold on our team.
[102:32.50]Each.
[102:33.86]True.
[102:35.10]Dollars.
[102:36.18]Is that lobby up or new?
[102:41.01]I don't want to show it.
[102:43.09]Who's the Ninja Turtle?
[102:45.57]I think it's a bunch.
[102:48.01]Russell, your shit might be fucked.
[102:49.89]I think so.
[102:51.32]I think you need to reload.
[102:53.08]Oh, no.
[102:54.88]It's actually good that they dodged.
[102:56.90]Okay.
[102:58.28]Why?
[102:59.46]Resetting?
[103:00.96]He has his numbers stuck and I don't think he was in your lobby.
[103:03.12]I don't think he could actually see it.
[103:04.58]Yeah, I couldn't see anything.
[103:05.74]That's why I wasn't... I didn't know you guys were even... Last thing in disguise.
[103:21.07]Oh, yeah.
[103:21.35]Jeremy, last game, you went to kill the duo lane.
[103:23.85]Hit level two first before you do anything like that.
[103:25.89]Okay.
[103:28.00]yeah try and clear your jungle a lot first before gank ruining unless it's like a really obvious game did you know that guy makes videos on this game who are you talking to sure for it huh oh my bad I should I should know my place okay I mean I I I can take some light criticism though right I mean no I got it I got it very light
[103:53.08]I'm good at every game I play.
[103:54.88]That's actually a good point.
[103:56.94]In Overwatch, he was a pro at every character too.
[104:00.12]Yeah, that's actually, yeah.
[104:01.54]Okay, how do I join?
[104:03.66]Check this out.
[104:17.87]I invite you.
[104:19.21]I'm going to join through poke, I guess.
[104:21.53]Can you join through poke?
[104:22.53]I don't think you can.
[104:23.25]I think you need to go.
[104:23.89]No, that's what I did last time.
[104:24.83]I'm good.
[104:25.35]We're good.
[104:26.37]Oh, there we go.
[104:26.73]I'm in, baby.
[104:28.89]You guys like my icon, by the way?
[104:30.51]New lobby.
[104:31.03]Alright.
[104:31.51]Are we all in here?
[104:33.45]Yes.
[104:34.39]Alright.
[104:34.87]I'm joining the new lobby.
[104:37.49]Yes.
[104:39.81]Enough talk.
[104:44.67]It's time to chug their beer like.
[104:46.57]Are we good to go now, I think?
[104:50.53]How do we trash talk the other team?
[104:51.71]Can they see what we type?
[104:53.25]You guys.
[104:54.01]No, right now they can.
[104:57.00]Oh, no, you're talking to Party Chat.
[104:59.50]Oh, no, that's us.
[105:00.46]We're going to lose, man.
[105:02.92]No.
[105:03.22]You guys are going to lose.
[105:06.06]Oh, got it.
[105:06.90]Now I can type.
[105:09.43]LOL.
[105:10.73]XD.
[105:12.81]Match accepted.
[105:15.69]They'll have bans on.
[105:18.59]Go, baby.
[105:20.51]Just skip the bans for now.
[105:22.78]Yerma.
[105:24.20]Oh, pass.
[105:25.16]I say we just cheat it and ban their champs.
[105:29.14]Open up their streams, ban their champs, and keep it moving.
[105:37.00]What are we thinking here?
[105:38.62]Alright.
[105:40.12]No, don't ban Bakasora.
[105:41.26]I wanted to pick Bakasora.
[105:42.40]That would have been horrible.
[105:50.98]Excuse me.
[105:52.60]That'd be so funny if I did that though.
[105:54.78]I'd have to play Thanatos.
[105:58.66]I know how to play him.
[106:04.39]This game needs like a UI upgrade.
[106:09.67]It's just like League though.
[106:13.56]Yeah, totally.
[106:19.61]I think it's hard to do quick doing a ui upgrade I think for a game that has this many things to look at I feel like it's hard true yeah but look at like the bottom when you hover over a character it's like it looks I don't know it looks so plain they hit him ready oh they did hit ready
[106:48.48]I have to pass bans again.
[106:50.22]Yeah.
[106:51.60]Wait, is it my turn?
[106:52.58]Pick.
[106:53.28]Not yet.
[106:53.86]Oh, she's banning.
[106:54.48]There'll be no-goes, then they'll pick theirs, and then no-goes.
[106:58.98]Emery's banning again?
[107:00.48]Yeah, we have to pass it back and forth.
[107:01.94]You re-ban.
[107:02.78]They messed up.
[107:03.42]There's not supposed to be anyone.
[107:05.86]Silly guys.
[107:06.88]Very, very silly.
[107:09.48]Low magical damage.
[107:10.88]Uh-oh.
[107:11.96]I mean, the UI definitely has been updated in this game, because I remember playing back in, like,
[107:16.44]That's true.
[107:16.84]By the way, those of you that are watching, drops are enabled.
[107:18.62]There is a custom, not custom, a new, is it even new?
[107:19.90]I don't know.
[107:20.22]There's a skin, there's a Cupid skin.
[107:21.36]It's called Cupid Dreadnought.
[107:22.74]And it is a...
[107:38.54]If you support this team here, you can potentially get that if your drops are enabled.
[107:45.91]So give it a look.
[107:47.76]Yeah!
[107:48.84]Yeah, we're the best team.
[107:50.16]We are number one.
[107:51.47]Are you an infomercial salesman?
[107:53.11]Alright, go win the game.
[107:54.55]I'm trying to sell it.
[107:55.47]Good luck.
[107:57.69]I retyped your builds, your ANC builds.
[107:59.43]I retyped them in order, by the way.
[108:01.47]So you can just look.
[108:02.48]Give me one five-second tip on jungle that I didn't do last game.
[108:06.16]Farm more.
[108:06.96]Okay.
[108:07.74]Farm a lot more.
[108:08.70]Okay.
[108:09.88]I farm a lot more.
[108:10.62]Let's copy-paste this.
[108:15.18]Thank you.
[108:15.82]Your item is Sentinel's Boon.
[108:17.56]When you were looking late game... Ah, Sentinel's Boon.
[108:20.70]Okay.
[108:21.99]Thank you very much.
[108:22.73]Alright, see you later.
[108:25.83]So they got thanatos in the jungle.
[108:27.41]I think.
[108:28.95]I don't know.
[108:29.71]Whatever.
[108:31.19]He's using the Mizkif skin.
[108:32.43]Yeah.
[108:36.24]Wait, they all have the same profile picture.
[108:37.52]Why does his banner look like that?
[108:38.52]Does that mean he actually plays the game?
[108:41.02]Probably.
[108:52.94]Alright.
[108:54.30]I feel like this game is going to go smoother.
[108:55.99]Let's make it happen.
[108:58.37]Do I buy five pots?
[108:59.31]Wait a minute.
[108:59.77]I have extra money.
[109:01.49]You buy it.
[109:02.87]You shouldn't have extra money.
[109:04.07]Speed, speed, speed.
[109:05.25]That's why.
[109:06.26]Fucking music is too loud.
[109:10.68]Shut up, Surefour.
[109:11.70]I didn't even look and I knew it was you.
[109:14.14]Wait, no.
[109:14.60]I still have money.
[109:15.24]I bought Death Toll.
[109:16.52]And she knows me.
[109:17.49]And three pots.
[109:18.31]You just do that.
[109:19.11]I know.
[109:21.13]Alright, heads in the game.
[109:24.75]Go to where you need to be.
[109:27.32]We got to win this one.
[109:28.18]I'm starting three, Daddy.
[109:30.38]I didn't buy my beads.
[109:33.04]Poke, communicate with me.
[109:35.90]Poke, communicate with me.
[109:39.22]Remember, don't take my camp or else.
[109:41.22]I swear to God I will run it down mid if you take my camp.
[109:44.28]No.
[109:46.32]Okay.
[109:49.35]Alright guys, play well, play hard.
[109:51.03]There's a different game, stop singing that.
[109:53.71]I'm not gonna be there in time.
[109:54.92]Oh geez, a ward!
[109:55.32]They hit it first, oh no.
[110:15.54]The game is so loud now.
[110:18.26]Your game is loud now?
[110:19.53]I turned it up.
[110:21.63]I'll turn it down.
[110:22.73]In the game.
[110:23.61]I'll turn it down.
[110:29.49]Perfect.
[110:30.11]Alright, let's do it.
[110:35.20]Oh, I just got stunned.
[110:37.66]Okay, I'm feeling very, very confident.
[110:39.92]I don't know why, but I'm feeling so confident.
[110:41.66]Really, we went the long way.
[110:45.17]Why does this get so loud?
[110:46.63]I turned up like a tiny bit.
[110:47.79]Alright, good luck.
[110:52.13]They're level two.
[110:53.09]Thank you.
[110:53.45]Do we have to back up?
[110:55.41]Yeah, I feel like we have to back up because they're level two.
[111:02.09]My game volume went up like crazy.
[111:03.77]Oh, wow.
[111:12.58]I'm backing up.
[111:15.04]As you should.
[111:21.26]Help me, help me, help me.
[111:21.90]In the jungle, in the jungle, in the jungle.
[111:23.65]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[111:27.49]Careful, back it up.
[111:28.17]Okay.
[111:29.45]Yeah, we can do this little totem thing.
[111:31.87]Nice.
[111:33.69]Be careful.
[111:34.01]They're going in, they're going in.
[111:34.77]Careful.
[111:36.43]I'm good, I'm good.
[111:45.06]Let's punish that if we can.
[111:46.18]No, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[111:49.08]Not worth it.
[111:50.64]Oh my god, what?
[111:51.94]Bro, that ability is nuts.
[111:52.84]I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
[111:54.70]Not worth it.
[111:56.79]My base here.
[112:04.99]I know we can talk screaming right now.
[112:10.63]He's probably like, you're not supposed to be over there.
[112:13.63]They're low.
[112:13.93]They're low.
[112:14.89]Yep.
[112:15.47]Oh, I just got stunned out of my three.
[112:19.39]I got stunned out of my three.
[112:20.83]Okay, let's go back.
[112:25.33]Wait, we actually backed them out of lane, so that could be good for us.
[112:30.43]Left side is in my A. I'm going to get mid buff.
[112:40.74]Is there any buff that we can get while they're gone?
[112:45.78]Um, I don't think so.
[112:51.64]Left side, MIS though.
[112:59.18]Never mind, he's back.
[113:00.20]Perfect.
[113:03.62]Buff is down here for one of you guys.
[113:05.44]Yeah.
[113:07.06]Wait, we can actually... We can play aggressive here.
[113:10.97]Oh wait, they do have items, but...
[113:14.79]How you guys doing?
[113:16.96]They can gank too though.
[113:19.52]Their jungler is going mid right now.
[113:21.54]I ward in our jungle as well.
[113:23.44]Can we go do our purple thing or their purple thing?
[113:25.13]We'll do their purple thing.
[113:26.19]It's on the ground right now for you.
[113:28.07]Their jungler is at their red right now.
[113:30.49]My side is going mid.
[113:33.75]I think they're going to go.
[113:34.60]Fight it.
[113:39.06]Mid's going over to you guys.
[113:40.36]Yeah, mid's going over to you guys too.
[113:44.73]I'm right here, I'm right here.
[113:48.63]No, there's too many.
[113:53.87]They're low.
[113:55.30]Yeah, we can fight this.
[113:56.54]No, I went around.
[113:59.58]Careful, careful, careful, careful.
[114:00.66]Just get out.
[114:02.12]Oh, no.
[114:03.78]Oh, no.
[114:05.20]There's too many.

[114:13.26]Alright, that's good.
[114:14.20]That's good.
[114:14.64]Oh shit.

[114:23.91]Everything's good.
[114:25.31]Just back to square one.
[114:26.01]I put a fucking ward by accident.
[114:34.07]I need a board.
[114:34.65]I think it's the best of us.

[115:12.93]They're getting a right.
[115:15.21]Oh wait, my ward got him.
[115:18.95]Let's go.
[115:20.57]That's a big ward right there.
[115:26.50]They're going right, they're going right, they're going right.
[115:28.66]Yeah, mid's going right right now.
[115:30.02]We can't do anything about it because of their jungle, right?
[115:34.65]Unless he left.
[115:37.76]He must have left.
[115:41.40]I have ult next level, so that's good.
[115:46.69]Okay, now we can go right side after I level up here.
[115:49.77]Help me level, help me level.
[115:50.94]Okay, I level, I level.

[116:02.88]We're coming, we're coming, we're coming.
[116:04.69]Keep him busy, keep him busy.

[117:18.44]We gotta be careful of that Thanatos.
[117:19.56]5-0.
[117:21.04]He has all the kills in the whole team.
[117:22.90]Wait, holy fuck.
[117:24.74]Yeah, we gotta focus that Thanatos every time.
[117:26.56]This Ravana is really strong.
[117:32.85]I can't kill this Ravana.
[117:33.83]What the fuck?
[117:37.71]Hold on, I'm buying Thebes.
[117:41.55]I'm gonna kill this Ravana.
[117:46.57]Off the base.

[118:20.02]Wait, let's just try a... Let's trap it up.
[118:21.12]I don't know what that is, but I took it.

[118:31.39]Fuck it.
[118:31.77]Left is missing.
[118:32.29]Left is missing.
[118:32.79]Left is missing.
[118:36.27]Yeah, we got a couple in mid.
[118:37.91]You can't run.
[118:38.37]You can't run.
[118:39.15]Anatos ulted mid.
[118:43.75]I got him!
[118:46.94]Thanatos is going to you guys, he has no ult though.
[118:53.06]He's one, he's one.
[118:54.38]No, no, no, that's not worth it.
[118:55.34]I know, I know.

[119:35.47]Is that 1337 health?
[119:36.63]Just letting you know.
[119:41.25]Thanatos is right side jungle.
[119:42.37]He's right side jungle.
[119:43.03]I don't know where he's going.
[119:43.65]I think he's going towards mid.
[119:44.99]I got to go finish my item.
[119:50.77]They're all here.
[119:51.51]They're all here.
[120:00.30]I'm here though.
[120:01.30]Hey, if they want to fight this, if they want to fight this, I'm going to come through the jungle.
[120:06.32]If they push that, wait, don't push.
[120:07.60]Wait, actually bait them, bait them.
[120:08.54]I can ult them under tower.
[120:09.44]I need to get rid of this fucking thing.
[120:13.24]If they push, I can genuinely ult them under tower.
[120:15.07]Yeah, if they, if they, I get it.
[120:16.81]Yeah, go for it, go for it.
[120:17.87]I'm doing it.
[120:18.57]Let's do this.
[120:20.45]Mid's missing.
[120:25.21]There it is.
[120:25.65]There it is.
[120:26.07]There it is.
[120:26.47]There it is.
[120:26.93]Nice job, boys.
[120:27.51]Huge, huge, huge.
[120:29.49]Push the tower.
[120:31.38]What's this thing?
[120:38.58]I'm hearing anime music.
[120:40.34]It's sick.
[120:41.54]Alright, we gotta be careful.
[120:44.34]Don't go too heavy here.
[120:46.26]We should probably get this tower though, right?
[120:47.84]Yeah, but after this we gotta get out of here.
[120:49.52]Yeah, I agree.
[120:51.08]Get out.
[120:54.50]Alright.
[120:55.93]This is very greedy of us to kill the minions, but that's fine.
[121:01.20]If you back, I back right here.
[121:02.92]Oh, never mind.
[121:03.34]I'm scared.
[121:03.68]I'm going to back around this corner.
[121:07.96]Oh god.
[121:11.66]Alright, looking good.
[121:12.88]Good job.
[121:14.08]Keep it up.
[121:16.02]Thebes?
[121:18.16]I'm pretty stacked right now.
[121:20.04]I can get Thebes and 40 gold.
[121:20.94]I'm going to wait.
[121:21.68]Okay, we're good.
[121:25.14]What am I doing here?
[121:25.72]Am I dead?
[121:29.32]Are you dead?
[121:31.38]No, you're... Left is missing, by the way.
[121:40.94]It doesn't matter if we do it together, right?
[121:43.06]No, no, it's all good.
[121:44.84]As long as you pick it up.
[121:46.36]Left side's mid right now.
[121:47.67]Yo, your purple's almost up, Poki.
[121:50.59]Yeah, I'm gonna get my item first.
[121:52.11]I just put two wards in the same room.
[121:53.91]There's four mid.
[121:56.91]Got a big item.
[121:58.55]Big item, I think.
[121:59.95]This Amuzin cop is kind of alone here.
[122:12.65]I just heard Thanatos in the mid.
[122:14.55]Watch out.
[122:15.51]Watch out.
[122:15.77]Thanatos is on you guys.
[122:18.60]Just try to get out.
[122:22.12]If he's still chasing you, I might be able to jump on top of him.
[122:24.04]I took some of the XP camp so they couldn't get it.
[122:26.16]I'm with you.
[122:28.89]I'm with you.
[122:32.25]Nice.
[122:32.91]Nice work.
[122:34.01]They're on the XP camp.
[122:35.69]Watch out.
[122:35.93]Watch out.
[122:36.23]Watch out.
[122:37.15]Oh, wait.
[122:37.55]We beat them.
[122:38.25]They're so low.
[122:39.09]I'm ready.
[122:39.31]I'm ready.
[122:40.35]I'm in.
[122:40.75]I'm in.
[122:41.57]Let's go.
[122:42.45]Let's go.
[122:43.33]I would be careful.
[122:43.93]We might get... I'm in.
[122:44.63]I'm in.
[122:44.85]No, no, no.
[122:46.16]There's no one over here.
[122:51.00]Okay.
[122:51.26]Now, be careful.
[122:57.39]I'm pushing this because I have my stun.
[122:59.11]Got him.
[122:59.95]Alright.
[123:00.19]I'm out.
[123:01.59]I wouldn't go too far in.
[123:02.69]They're dead.
[123:06.31]Good shit.
[123:06.85]Actually, I'm going to get some cancer.
[123:09.00]Good shit.
[123:10.92]Easy.
[123:13.06]Dude, our combo is crazy.
[123:14.22]How do I... Okay.
[123:16.48]You can't check the map like League, right?
[123:18.30]Watch out.
[123:18.60]Watch out.
[123:19.14]Let's leave.
[123:19.50]Let's leave.
[123:20.14]It's just at the top right all the time.
[123:22.69]I just heard... Is that Thanatos again?
[123:24.53]Oh, let's get this XP.
[123:26.84]Right here.
[123:27.46]Wait, what are you doing?
[123:30.69]Oh, sorry.
[123:31.59]No, you're good.
[123:33.71]Okay, let's get this one then.
[123:35.09]Get this one.
[123:35.47]Kill this guy.
[123:35.99]Okay, okay.
[123:36.67]You're gonna get this blue.
[123:37.65]Wait, no, I didn't.
[123:38.17]I didn't get him.
[123:38.77]Nah, I was just gonna ward.
[123:40.31]Alright, alright.
[123:41.03]We can't get him.
[123:41.71]We can't get him.
[123:42.37]Let's just get the XP.
[123:43.65]Are they doing Pyro?
[123:44.91]They're doing the Pyro right now.
[123:46.31]We should do Pyro when we can.
[123:47.43]They're doing it right now.
[123:48.25]They're doing it right now.
[123:49.79]Let's jump on top of this.
[123:50.62]I have my ult.
[123:51.92]Alright, we should probably come to them then, right?
[123:53.70]Let's go to them.
[123:56.98]We should get oracles.
[124:02.15]Nice work.
[124:03.61]Finish it up.
[124:04.01]Finish it up.
[124:05.19]Wait, let's kill this first.
[124:06.17]Poke, are you coming?
[124:07.71]Push this wave real quick.
[124:08.77]Alright, let him go.
[124:10.53]Let him go.
[124:11.80]Push.
[124:12.08]Push.
[124:12.98]Can I steal that?
[124:13.74]Push your lane.
[124:14.14]Push your lane.
[124:15.28]Maybe.
[124:16.60]Nice job.
[124:18.12]Pokey.
[124:19.04]Yeah?
[124:19.72]We kill oracles and shit.
[124:21.32]What is that?
[124:21.68]Can we do that?
[124:22.70]Over here.
[124:23.48]Okay, I'm coming.
[124:23.88]I'm coming.
[124:24.10]I'm coming.
[124:25.08]I gotta go reset.
[124:28.53]Be careful.
[124:30.03]I'm fine.
[124:31.09]I missed.
[124:35.99]Take whatever you can.
[124:37.57]Oh, no.
[124:37.91]Take whatever you can.
[124:39.97]I have enough camps down here.
[124:43.47]Take him.
[124:46.19]Take him.
[124:46.47]No, no.
[124:47.51]Leave.
[124:47.77]Leave.
[124:47.93]He does a lot of damage.
[124:48.61]He does a lot of damage.
[124:49.27]Oh, we can't beat that.
[124:50.13]I feel like a spider just ran across your desk.
[124:56.33]Are wards permanent?
[124:57.39]That's how I feel right now, honestly.
[124:59.53]That's a good question.
[125:01.95]No, they're not.
[125:02.85]No, they're timed.
[125:04.59]What the fuck?
[125:06.23]Do I help you with this?
[125:07.29]Yeah, it just gives it all money.
[125:10.53]Not smite knowledge.
[125:11.41]Alright, I'm going to go.
[125:11.99]I got to buy something.
[125:13.17]I'm going to go left.
[125:14.57]I know I should buy something.
[125:15.45]Hey, Russell, if we could take this.
[125:16.95]I'm not here.
[125:18.13]I'm not there.
[125:20.35]Thanatos is going right side.
[125:24.56]1300.
[125:24.92]I took it.
[125:25.28]I left one.
[125:25.72]I was scared.
[125:28.98]Okay.
[125:29.82]I'm here now.
[125:31.70]I have to ward though.
[125:32.54]Ooh.

[125:35.50]I'm coming over there.
[125:36.52]Oh, God.
[125:37.15]Yeah.
[125:37.41]Let's go to the right.
[125:37.93]If you guys can come to me, I can help.
[125:40.45]This is the best I can do.
[125:42.89]After that, I don't know what to do.
[125:44.11]Poke, you're running the wrong way though.
[125:45.65]I know.
[125:45.93]I was dead 100%.
[125:47.19]Yeah.
[125:47.37]Make them think they're going to get a kill on you because we're all here now.
[125:51.60]Okay.
[125:54.52]They're backing out right back in there.
[125:56.08]They know they know oh shit right here I'm here I'm sorry we got his wing that I think I can kill him if he jumps on me that was a good wipe We can get the kill kill get that thanatos get that thanatos get that thanatos Wait he gets so much help from killing me.

[126:20.73]Wait, wow, that was crazy how much health you just got.
[126:23.33]That was a good exchange, though.
[126:24.75]We got three of them, right?
[126:26.71]I see more gold.
[126:34.44]I might be getting tower.
[126:36.74]Yeah, that's good, good, good, good.
[126:39.68]They're all coming up now, though.
[126:41.08]They're all just responsive.
[126:41.98]Be careful.
[126:42.20]Yeah, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
[126:44.98]Pretty sure we're stronger than them, so we should start grouping up and doing like gold fury and shit.
[126:51.04]Yeah, let's try to get gold fury right now.
[126:57.65]Wait, should I?
[126:58.55]I want to wait for Prydwen.

[127:20.71]Okay, I'm waiting for a lot of gold, actually.
[127:23.72]Probably shouldn't have done that.
[127:25.24]I should probably pick up the damage buff, right?
[127:26.68]I'm in.
[127:28.36]They just got killed.
[127:29.02]Oh, they just got it.

[127:32.48]Yeah, you got to run poke.
[127:33.52]They're going to come to you.
[127:37.61]Yeah, we're stronger than them.
[127:38.51]If we just group up, we can do objectives.
[127:40.79]Oh, my God.
[127:43.21]The pyro is going to be up soon.
[127:44.62]Yeah, we can probably get pyro.
[127:47.92]Alright, so should I come to you guys to get pyro?

[128:00.75]Careful.
[128:01.65]Poke maybe... Okay, actually you got the 1v1.
[128:04.84]You can do that.
[128:06.48]I'm going to keep pushing left.
[128:09.12]Wait, wait.
[128:09.44]They need help though on Pyro.
[128:10.98]Is it just AMC in mid?
[128:11.88]Can I go?
[128:12.38]Can I go to you?
[128:13.94]Watch out.
[128:14.42]They're coming to you.
[128:15.05]No go.
[128:15.81]We need Pyro.
[128:16.83]They're rotating.
[128:17.39]They're rotating from right.
[128:18.23]They're right here.
[128:19.43]They're coming to you.
[128:21.31]We could actually probably move on these two.
[128:23.60]If you want to move to me, I can bait it.
[128:26.20]I'm here.
[128:26.52]I'm here as well.
[128:30.49]Where's Pyro?
[128:31.11]Is it this guy?
[128:32.79]I'm so strong right now.
[128:33.86]I'm going to ward it.
[128:36.98]I'm warding it.
[128:37.46]Watch out.
[128:38.38]Then I'm going to keep pushing tower.
[128:39.52]I'm going to keep pushing tower.
[128:40.40]Stay on the side.
[128:41.24]We can take.
[128:42.62]Oh, the Raven is here.
[128:44.48]Both here.
[128:45.02]I'm pushing up.

[128:47.35]I'm collapsing.
[128:48.29]Is Pyro up?
[128:50.21]No, it's almost up.
[128:51.61]I'm warding.
[128:52.01]I'm going to ward deeper.
[128:54.59]We might be able to like... Let's get Pyro.
[128:56.71]Alright, get on Pyro.
[128:59.25]I'm here.
[129:00.05]I'm studying.
[129:00.59]They're coming in.

[130:06.95]I pressed my beads.
[130:07.93]I used my beads.
[130:09.69]Dude, I had two green teas this morning.
[130:12.09]I'm fucked right now.
[130:13.43]So you're zooted is what you're telling me.

[130:24.55]That's why I was talking to you.
[130:26.09]Oh.

[130:42.43]He's going to try to execute you.
[130:43.61]Yep.
[130:44.85]They got me.
[130:45.63]There's three, though.
[130:46.17]There's three there.
[130:48.61]Oh, fuck.
[130:50.35]Damn it.

[130:51.39]Left side.
[130:53.58]The whole team is here.
[130:54.26]I don't understand how I'm so under-leveled.
[130:55.58]Shit.
[130:55.82]The whole team's here.
[130:57.24]I'm actually really strong.
[130:58.19]What am I doing wrong that makes you so under-leveled?
[131:01.95]Dude, sure, Forbes.
[131:02.84]What the fuck?
[131:04.48]He just literally came and took my last hit.
[131:06.14]It wasn't Sherpa.
[131:07.28]It was me.
[131:08.16]I did more than half your damage.
[131:10.34]Wait, really?
[131:11.36]Yes.
[131:12.00]You guys can keep pushing.
[131:13.56]The good news is we're off the build.
[131:15.16]I caught her.
[131:15.59]I caught her out of place.
[131:16.19]I told you I was coming.
[131:17.65]We're in a good spot.
[131:19.01]Just keep taking objectives.
[131:20.19]I don't know what to say here.
[131:21.97]You win.
[131:24.35]Wait, Poke.
[131:25.29]You're really pushed off right side, you're saying.
[131:29.31]I'm crazy right now, Russell.
[131:32.68]It's just that Thanatos.
[131:34.12]That Thanatos is their entire kill.
[131:37.46]He's got all the money.
[131:38.68]11 and 2.
[131:40.06]We're just going to stay on top of that Thanatos.
[131:42.48]When you see the Thanatos, if we're in a team fight, just collapse.
[131:46.44]You know that word that we like to use?
[131:47.96]I don't know.
[131:50.46]I think in particular it's the word you really like to use.
[131:59.47]I need XP.
[132:02.33]Yeah, at this point we need to get some objectives.
[132:04.43]I'm strong right now.
[132:05.47]We should fight or something.
[132:06.85]Most of us are really strong.
[132:08.37]We can prep the fire dragon to be honest.
[132:09.73]If they all go right, I mean top right is... I'm really strong.
[132:12.59]Top right is pushing.
[132:13.39]Yeah, top right is pushing.
[132:14.77]I can push out left.
[132:16.47]You guys want to just go to it?
[132:17.25]Oh, right here.
[132:18.15]Someone right here in front of me.
[132:19.85]I'm here.
[132:23.04]Two on me.
[132:23.84]Yeah, there's two.
[132:24.80]There's going to be more.
[132:25.40]You should back off.
[132:25.98]We're stronger though.
[132:26.58]We're stronger.
[132:27.18]They're on gold fury.
[132:27.98]They're on gold fury, guys.
[132:30.50]I'm going to help you.
[132:30.96]I can push left then.
[132:34.02]I can push left if you force something right.
[132:36.71]They're pushing us right.
[132:37.61]They're pushing us right.
[132:38.57]Okay.
[132:38.81]Then I'm going to take tower.
[132:39.67]Easy.
[132:40.17]And I can do Phoenix.
[132:40.81]I'm going to force them.
[132:41.53]They're all here.
[132:42.03]They're all here.
[132:42.41]They're on Goldfury.
[132:43.17]Yeah.
[132:43.27]They're on Goldfury.
[132:43.75]Yeah.
[132:43.85]This is going to be big.
[132:44.57]I'm going to take tower.
[132:45.07]Should I ult?
[132:45.43]Should I ult?
[132:45.91]Oh, wait.
[132:46.15]No.
[132:46.31]Never mind because there's not really much of us.
[132:48.03]You just take their attention as much as you can.
[132:49.76]Oh, that was pretty big but... We can fight.
[132:51.86]We can fight.
[132:52.22]We can fight.
[132:53.00]I pulled one.
[132:53.50]I pulled one.
[132:54.38]I pulled Athena.
[132:54.96]Athena's here.
[132:55.70]Does Phoenix hurt me?
[132:59.10]That's big.
[133:02.96]Don't get too greedy, though, because they have... I could flash root.
[133:07.36]I accidentally jumped.
[133:14.74]I almost knocked Phoenix.
[133:15.64]I think I'm going to... No.
[133:19.48]I can't kill Phoenix.
[133:20.24]Does Phoenix regen HP?
[133:22.22]No.
[133:22.44]Oh.
[133:22.63]I almost got it.
[133:24.79]I almost got it.
[133:25.45]It was close.
[133:26.51]Alright.
[133:27.13]Back it up.
[133:38.32]Just keep on doing what you're doing.
[133:39.80]Nice.
[133:52.91]Is it just one there?
[133:55.67]I'm coming towards you.
[133:58.81]One HP.
[133:59.91]He ulted.
[134:02.93]No!
[134:04.01]I almost killed him.
[134:05.08]Careful.
[134:10.34]Oh my god.
[134:10.90]I almost killed him.
[134:11.54]I outplayed the fuck out of him too.
[134:13.88]Yeah, I thought he was going to run away with that alone.
[134:16.38]That heal is just so... It's crazy.
[134:17.76]They're coming towards me.
[134:21.36]How many?
[134:22.64]I'm here.
[134:23.50]I'm behind them.
[134:24.22]I'm behind them.
[134:24.80]I'm behind them.
[134:25.88]I'm going to keep pushing right side.
[134:27.58]Yeah, yeah.
[134:28.83]Let's do it.
[134:29.85]Alting him.
[134:30.23]Alting him.
[134:31.17]He's running.
[134:31.51]There we go.
[134:38.60]That Robin is really strong.
[134:40.53]Does my magic shell help you guys?
[134:41.69]Because I can... Oh, I'm... I'm rooting for... Oh, boss.
[134:45.39]Shit.
[134:46.13]Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive.
[134:47.15]Yeah, I'm staying alive.
[134:48.37]Fuck.
[134:49.23]I'm running away.
[134:54.52]Jesus.
[134:56.58]Yeah, he's so tanky.
[134:57.78]We need some penetration items.
[134:59.42]Yeah, we're getting pushed hard left side, just saying.
[135:01.70]I almost fucking one-shot the... Yeah, the Anatoly is very squishy.
[135:06.10]Yeah.
[135:07.39]Oh, that's not good.
[135:08.23]I mean, I can kill the Ravana.
[135:09.47]I'm actually fucking him.
[135:11.23]I wasted my ulti.
[135:12.45]I have 2,800 gold.
[135:12.91]I'm gonna back.
[135:14.63]Yeah, if you have more than 2,000 gold, definitely go back and spend some money.
[135:17.49]Holy shit.
[135:20.81]Alright, we gotta start grouping up now.
[135:23.17]We gotta start moving as a team.
[135:26.93]Let's do objectives when we can.
[135:29.49]Is Goldfury up?
[135:32.19]Or Pyro?
[135:33.09]Pyro's up, I think, right?
[135:34.75]Yeah.
[135:42.03]I am farming.
[135:42.73]We need wards, by the way.
[135:44.55]Ah, shit.
[135:45.05]That's right.
[135:45.39]I forgot to get wards.
[135:46.57]I bought them earlier.
[135:47.59]I put a couple at fire.
[135:48.45]Yeah, I bought some earlier and then I just forgot.
[135:50.27]Let's all buy like two and then... I'm already out of days.
[135:54.04]I'll get some after though.
[135:57.03]I'm ready to fight.
[136:01.34]Right side's pushed up.
[136:02.34]No.
[136:04.46]They're right here.
[136:09.33]They're alright here.
[136:13.03]Watch mid.
[136:14.05]Three mid, four mid actually.
[136:15.99]Coming mid.
[136:19.95]They're going right side jungle.
[136:21.79]They're going right side jungle for some reason.
[136:26.10]Do you just want to do Fire Giant?
[136:27.98]We could try.
[136:29.26]Wait, it didn't work.
[136:29.94]Never mind.
[136:31.00]I think we could do Fire Giant.
[136:34.66]Maybe?
[136:34.88]We need like a pick or something first.
[136:38.11]Or we have to deward it.
[136:39.77]You got to back off.
[136:41.15]There's three mid.
[136:44.63]Alright.
[136:44.87]I'm going to get these camps.
[136:45.71]Running towards me.
[136:55.14]I'm trying to be the guy to keep forgetting that.
[136:59.52]That is your job.
[137:05.78]Blue is down here.
[137:06.60]I feel like we shouldn't push this.
[137:07.60]They're coming.
[137:13.28]How many?
[137:13.84]All of them?
[137:16.12]Thanatos mid.
[137:16.74]Thanatos mid.
[137:17.36]He got trapped.
[137:18.18]We can go deep in their jungle and try and gank them.
[137:20.81]I almost have enough.
[137:21.91]I almost have enough.
[137:22.71]We should run together then.
[137:24.09]We can do Fire Giant.
[137:24.85]Why don't we just sit all on Fire Giant right now?
[137:27.31]And just wait for them.
[137:28.01]We don't know where any of them are.
[137:29.31]We don't know any of them are on the map.
[137:31.41]They're in mid.
[137:31.95]They're right here.
[137:32.69]I think we win the trade.
[137:33.83]We have two 20s.
[137:34.75]They're right here.
[137:35.63]Oh, they have two 20s now.
[137:37.27]I think they know we're going for it.
[137:38.73]Yeah, they're right beside us.
[137:43.15]Here we go.
[137:44.99]Watch out for the collapse behind us.
[137:46.29]Wait, we shouldn't back off too hard, should we?
[137:52.13]No, we're just... I mean, if you see a fight, get the fight.
[137:55.14]Oh, right there.
[137:55.98]They're right at Fire Giant.
[137:56.98]Yeah.
[137:58.60]I mean, I don't mind going in and ulting.
[138:01.06]I don't care.
[138:01.92]Are they going for it?
[138:02.52]You do you, bro.
[138:03.24]If you see it, go for it.
[138:04.54]I mean, they're thinking about it.
[138:07.65]just like we are we should just go around honestly I can buy I could just buy I I'm I have enough to buy like alright they're only mid well if we if you buy though don't we just can I be a cheeky asshole and go get the phoenix oh no alright I'm gonna wait I think we just I messed up I gotta go I gotta finish my uh items oh wait I gotta get my last item here I bought wards

[138:36.63]Yo, are we checking it?
[138:37.53]Someone check Fire Giants.
[138:38.45]No one's on fire.
[138:40.62]They weren't on.
[138:41.26]Oh my god.
[138:41.68]Yeah.
[138:42.54]Oh.
[138:42.72]That's not good.
[138:43.74]Oh no.
[138:44.04]I mean, it's because we all backed off.
[138:47.64]Shit.
[138:48.18]Yeah, we needed to ward it.
[138:49.18]Fuck.
[138:50.62]I got wards.
[138:52.58]We're still alright.
[138:53.52]I have ward now.
[138:54.34]Yeah, I think we're ahead by a lot.
[138:56.60]It's just we just need to... I kept saying let's fight it and then I don't know why we went to go buy something.
[139:01.53]I went to go buy because we should have just bought it.

[139:36.23]Ravenna's hurt.
[139:38.67]We can push them in.
[139:39.19]We can push them in.
[139:39.71]Let's go.
[139:40.19]Yeah.
[139:41.53]If you guys push mid, I can push left.
[139:43.05]Yeah, let's do it.
[139:43.47]We'll just push with those.
[139:45.26]Okay, I'll push with you.
[139:51.56]There's a Phoenix on left as well.
[139:53.46]Yep.
[139:54.16]We have no creeps for it though.
[139:57.39]Just be careful.
[139:58.01]Alright, here we go.
[140:03.62]I think one of us should at least.
[140:06.42]I almost have my ult up.
[140:07.32]Can we do objectives?
[140:09.74]Any objective?
[140:10.50]Yeah, what's up?
[140:10.92]We can do gold, Fury.
[140:12.62]We can do gold.
[140:13.60]How's everybody on money?
[140:14.56]We can do gold.
[140:15.58]I tried to run.
[140:21.30]Fuck, I can cut him off.
[140:22.13]I'm cutting him off.
[140:24.33]Is he invisible now?
[140:25.33]On me, on me.
[140:26.57]On me, on me.
[140:27.23]Come to me, come to me.
[140:27.87]Now, now, now, now, now.
[140:31.23]I chain him.
[140:31.71]I chain him.
[140:32.57]Got it.
[140:34.23]No, we win.
[140:36.45]We win.
[140:37.19]I think.
[140:38.85]Keep it up.
[140:39.17]Keep fighting.
[140:39.57]Keep fighting.
[140:39.93]That's it.
[140:40.15]That's it.
[140:40.41]That's it.
[140:40.69]That's it.
[140:40.95]That's it.
[140:41.21]Push Phoenix.
[140:41.61]We can probably end it mid.
[140:42.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[140:43.39]Push mid.
[140:43.69]Push mid.
[140:43.99]Push mid.
[140:44.49]Oh, my God.
[140:44.83]I think they're bursting me in my relic.
[140:46.35]I just ate all of it.
[140:47.23]I just ate all of that.
[140:48.09]Dope.
[140:51.41]Oh, shit.
[140:52.12]In my pants.
[140:53.58]I'm chaining him.
[140:54.20]I missed the chain.
[140:55.18]I missed the chain.
[140:56.48]Sorry.
[140:56.88]Does everybody get him?
[140:57.58]Everybody attack him.
[140:59.38]He can't kill us all.
[141:04.01]Oh my fucking god!
[141:05.57]That guy has a trillion health!
[141:09.50]That's it, that's gonna- I still have ulti, I still have ulti, I still have ulti.
[141:15.28]We gotta get the phoenix.
[141:16.04]We have to get phoenix and bat.
[141:18.20]Yeah, we gotta get out.
[141:18.82]There's only- only one's gonna be up.
[141:21.41]Alright, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[141:23.19]No, no, no, no, they're all gonna be up.
[141:25.59]I hope Weekend's not screaming into his monitor right now.
[141:28.39]Yeah, we'll find out.
[141:30.13]Like, no, you fucking idiots, end the game!
[141:33.23]I was low, so... Yeah, I don't think we can.
[141:35.35]I mean, I have 2.4k gold.
[141:36.67]Yeah.
[141:36.79]I would like that.
[141:37.83]I also think it's kind of a throw, too.
[141:39.53]Like... Yeah.
[141:41.49]Is it bad to wait for 80 gold?
[141:43.47]No.
[141:45.21]We can just push side lanes now.
[141:46.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[141:47.11]I'm pushing.
[141:47.55]We win the 5v5.
[141:48.87]A full build, finally.
[141:51.71]Holy fuck.
[141:54.79]Man, I had ulti.
[141:55.59]I think we could have went really aggressive.
[141:57.49]Well, I was at like 20%.
[141:58.39]That's what I call poke.
[142:00.38]Just completely aggressive.
[142:04.00]Should we get an objective?
[142:04.70]Just have wards on Fire Giant.
[142:06.10]Wards on Fire Giant.
[142:07.72]Or we push 5 lanes.
[142:09.50]I'm gonna ward Fire Giant right now.
[142:12.48]Well, for one, right lane's already pushing alone.
[142:14.85]And I feel like... Just group up around Fire Giant.
[142:17.87]We can do pyromancer right now.
[142:19.61]I can do pyromancer.
[142:20.69]Oh, wait.
[142:20.95]Somebody's there.
[142:21.91]Yeah.
[142:22.25]We're okay.
[142:22.83]Wait.
[142:23.03]I'm not here yet.
[142:23.75]I'm not there yet.
[142:24.21]I'm not there yet.
[142:25.47]Oh, he's gonna... Yeah.
[142:26.53]They're right here.
[142:27.68]You guys are missing too.
[142:28.58]We win the 5v5.
[142:29.46]Yeah, we do.
[142:30.12]Yeah.
[142:31.36]Let's do pyromancer.
[142:32.46]Go, go, go.
[142:33.82]Let's do Pyro.
[142:35.08]We're doing it?
[142:35.89]Okay.
[142:36.85]I mean, it's just like a little guy.
[142:39.83]He's gonna try to steal it.
[142:41.35]Here they come.
[142:41.69]Here they come.
[142:44.11]This could be... We should probably engage this.
[142:46.22]Guys, I might just go in on this.
[142:48.32]Yeah, you do you.
[142:48.90]You're the tank, bro.
[142:49.78]I'm ready.
[142:50.08]I'm ready.
[142:50.74]Come with me.
[142:51.12]Come with me.
[142:53.10]I got one.
[142:53.50]I got one.
[142:53.82]That's all that matters.
[142:54.32]That's all that matters.
[142:54.82]They beat.
[142:55.14]They beat.
[142:55.68]Ah, fuck.
[142:56.10]They all beat.
[142:56.64]Shit.
[142:56.92]Sorry.
[142:57.26]I forgot about beats.
[142:58.12]Sorry.
[142:58.50]Sorry.
[142:58.68]Sorry.
[142:58.84]Back it up.
[142:59.08]Back it up.
[142:59.72]Back it up.
[143:00.52]Backing up.
[143:00.96]How long is the beats cooldown?
[143:01.96]I don't have time.
[143:03.42]200 seconds.
[143:03.88]Fire's going to be up.
[143:05.04]They're coming in.
[143:06.16]They're coming in.
[143:07.87]They're pushing.
[143:10.71]We can just push left and force the fight.
[143:13.01]Oh, shit.
[143:13.27]Okay.
[143:14.15]I'm going to back off.
[143:16.91]I'm going to back off.
[143:21.43]Oh, on me.
[143:21.83]Thanatos.
[143:22.99]You're fine.
[143:24.27]Yeah, we just pushed this lane.
[143:25.19]Look.
[143:25.45]And then mid will push right now.
[143:26.71]They're coming up.
[143:27.15]He's coming up.
[143:27.61]He's coming up.
[143:28.11]The Nautilus is behind him.
[143:29.05]The Nautilus and the team is behind him.
[143:30.87]We're gonna stick together.
[143:32.60]We gotta help him.
[143:37.76]I'm fucking 1 HP.
[143:38.14]I have to live.
[143:38.50]I have to live.
[143:38.88]I have to live.
[143:39.30]I have 1 HP.
[143:51.23]No, we can't do fire without fire.
[143:53.39]Watch out.
[143:53.65]Watch out.
[143:53.87]Watch out.
[143:54.25]Back up and make sure they don't get fire.
[143:55.69]You can do a quick back.
[143:56.43]I got him.
[143:56.67]I got him.
[143:56.95]I got him.
[143:58.37]I'm coming.
[143:58.65]I'm coming.
[143:58.87]I'm coming.
[144:27.92]There it is.
[144:28.42]Alright.
[144:28.84]Yeah, I'm just securing it.
[144:31.52]OK, OK, OK.
[144:32.34]It's just a cool down.
[144:33.40]Yeah, it is.
[144:34.32]Alright.
[144:35.80]We we're going to stick together and push her.
[144:38.28]How are we feeling?
[144:39.94]And we should push right side or something left.
[144:42.67]Just push left or right.
[144:44.25]Maybe right's easier because the fire dragon just went down.
[144:46.29]So, yeah, let's get it.
[144:47.87]I'm saying failure.
[145:01.53]What about this Primal Fury?
[145:04.61]Isn't it just gold?
[145:05.31]I don't know.
[145:05.87]We don't need that right now.
[145:06.61]I mean, that's fine.
[145:07.35]That's fine.
[145:07.69]It's gold.
[145:08.05]It doesn't matter.

[146:18.07]We just have to keep sieging.
[146:19.11]We're fine.
[146:21.21]Maybe mid?
[146:23.69]Mid Phoenix?

[149:00.40]Let me force left and push this wave.
[149:02.34]And they have to come fight it.
[149:05.44]Same thing that we did before.
[149:06.46]The Ravana's here.

[149:14.15]I got it.
[149:14.51]I got it.
[149:15.43]They were so clueless.
[149:18.63]Our middle tower, oh shit.
[149:20.55]We're good.
[149:21.13]They have to go take left lane.
[149:22.67]They have to deal with this.
[149:23.33]I think you could've pulled them there, Russell.
[149:25.63]Yeah, I mean, anyone goes left.
[149:26.81]I mean, that's my ult.
[149:28.01]I don't wanna, I don't wanna just use it on one guy.
[149:30.57]That's fine.
[149:30.85]They should do Fire Giant.
[149:31.65]I think they should.
[149:32.81]Okay, I'm down.
[149:33.21]I'm down.
[149:33.39]I'm gonna burst this thing.
[149:36.16]Are they in?
[149:37.76]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[149:38.36]No, they're close, they're close.
[149:39.78]Yeah, they're out.
[149:40.58]This is a Fire Giant fight here.
[149:42.00]They want it.
[149:43.95]If you ever see an opportunity to go in, that's all you.
[149:47.66]It's too mid right now.
[149:48.74]I'm here.
[149:49.00]I'm here.
[149:50.32]I'm pushing up.
[149:50.86]I'm just going to push up.
[149:53.48]Maybe we wrap around mid.
[149:54.46]Yeah, let's wrap around mid.
[149:55.18]Wrap around mid and let's kill these guys in mid.
[149:57.92]Wait.
[149:58.58]Okay.
[150:01.17]Because they're pushing too far up.
[150:03.57]Yeah.
[150:04.23]Wait, there's two on me though.
[150:05.19]I could ult them.
[150:07.83]If you get a pole... We should go back to dragon.
[150:09.57]Are we giving it up?
[150:13.30]There's one more.
[150:14.06]We're going to fight.
[150:15.56]Now's the time.
[150:16.66]Yeah, because one of them split.
[150:17.66]Maybe we should just... I put a bunch of traps on it.
[150:19.89]I put a bunch of traps on it.
[150:21.13]We should fight.
[150:21.53]We should fight.
[150:22.31]We should do it.
[150:23.27]We should do it.
[150:24.97]If there's any time, I guess we're going to go for it.
[150:27.35]I'm starting it.
[150:27.87]Let's go.
[150:28.77]They're so split.
[150:29.31]They're so split.
[150:29.77]They're so split.
[150:30.25]Just stay on the giant.
[150:31.03]Stay on the giant.
[150:31.65]They're split as fuck.
[150:35.51]Just secure it.
[150:36.01]Secure it.
[150:36.33]Secure it.
[150:36.67]Go ahead.
[150:37.09]Get them.
[150:37.67]I got one.
[150:38.19]I got one.
[150:43.02]Here we go.
[150:43.32]Let's focus the one that's closest.
[150:45.38]Always focus the one that's closest.
[150:50.32]Oh, fuck.
[150:50.96]Oh, fuck.
[150:51.74]Oh, fuck.
[150:52.32]Let's keep chasing them.
[150:53.98]Chain them.
[150:54.50]Chain them.
[150:54.86]Oh, no.
[150:55.16]I missed it.
[150:56.28]I'm one hit and I'm dead.
[150:57.10]I need to eat somebody.
[151:02.41]Just push left.
[151:02.97]Push left.
[151:03.31]Push left.
[151:03.59]Push left.
[151:03.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[151:09.87]Holy shit.
[151:20.36]They're dead for 25 seconds.
[151:22.18]Yeah, we have to win off this, to be honest.
[151:25.90]You can try.
[151:28.16]I mean, I'll take tower damage.
[151:29.78]Watch out for that Thanatos.
[151:31.10]Oh, not yet.
[151:31.58]He does a lot of damage.
[151:34.54]Okay, let's do this.
[151:39.79]If we can win a team fight right here, the game's over.
[151:41.35]I have a ult.
[151:42.95]If they get close, I'm ulting.
[151:44.15]If they get close, I'm ulting.
[151:45.31]I think we have to.
[151:45.95]Yeah, I'm here.
[151:46.53]I'm here.
[151:46.79]We're good.
[151:49.67]They're not going to push though.
[151:55.05]Alright.
[151:55.45]There it is.
[151:57.95]Let's go.
[151:58.85]There you go, buddy.
[152:01.17]Kill.
[152:01.43]Alright.
[152:02.11]Kill him.
[152:02.53]Yeah, just kill this thing.
[152:03.29]Kill this thing.
[152:06.73]Oh, that's it.
[152:08.19]Get it.
[152:09.37]Yes.
[152:09.97]Nice job.
[152:11.74]Let's go.
[152:12.40]Nice job.
[152:13.12]Good shit.
[152:15.76]Good fucking ult.
[152:17.04]Nice job, guys.
[152:17.56]Let's go, baby.
[152:20.74]Oh shit, my food's here.
[152:22.84]Food?
[152:23.40]Mmm, yummy.
[152:30.28]Easy.
[152:32.60]Very cool.
[152:33.46]Hey, good job.
[152:35.94]Oh, I didn't... I wanted to see the detail of the match.
[152:37.67]Shit.
[152:38.83]Oops.
[152:39.25]How do you see it by accident, bro?
[152:40.73]Yeah, I clicked back like an idiot.
[152:45.61]But there we go.
[152:46.85]Hey, at least we won one.
[152:50.47]You can't say, at least we won.
[152:53.49]We're going to win two.
[152:54.39]What do you mean, at least?
[152:57.97]I mean, at the very end of the day, no matter what happens, we won a game.
[153:02.43]Okay, Jerm.
[153:06.45]We all did a lot of damage.
[153:07.73]We did a lot.
[153:09.73]I think we can win the whole thing.
[153:11.64]Yeah.
[153:12.64]Play your damage weight.
[153:13.52]I only did weights on the way to Discord.
[153:17.45]I only did 17k player damage.
[153:21.09]I feel like that's not a lot.
[153:24.37]I mean, compared to 40 and 30, no.
[153:26.03]But, I mean, you still did more damage than most of the other team.
[153:33.44]I can see the chat again.
[153:34.34]Hold on.
[153:37.02]So, I'm not doing my roll correct?
[153:42.06]I really don't know.
[153:44.88]Coach, is he doing alright?
[153:46.58]Yeah, where's our coach?
[153:47.78]Coach, is he doing alright?
[153:49.11]Does he need a whipping?
[153:50.21]I think coach might be AFK.
[153:57.13]No!
[153:57.45]I don't want it.
[154:02.12]Be right back.
[154:04.56]I think we just gotta be more assertive when we know we're stronger.
[154:07.92]True.
[154:12.32]I did do a lot of structure damage.
[154:14.58]That's good.
[154:15.30]That's good.
[154:15.94]Lots of pushing.
[154:17.24]Yeah, my structure damage was 8,000.
[154:18.36]You guys were 1,000 and 200, 300.
[154:22.62]Okay, so that was my roll.
[154:28.54]I didn't do a lot of structure damage or damage in general, but I did do some stunning.
[154:36.79]So, yeah.
[154:38.65]I think what we also need to do is I also need to combine my alt, because my alt is a silence.
[154:44.17]So if you pull them in and I silence them, they can't shrink it.
[154:48.09]Yeah.
[154:49.75]That's actually smart.
[154:51.09]Holy shit.
[154:51.63]Yeah.
[154:51.79]Alright.
[154:54.37]So you want to know how to win the next game?
[154:56.85]Yes.
[154:58.73]Russell B, when you guys are grouping around the fire, blink and just fucking pull your dick out and slap them around.
[155:05.18]Just run at them.
[155:06.48]Don't be afraid of anything.
[155:08.04]What happened?
[155:09.86]Hey, that Herman Miller chair sure is good, isn't it?
[155:21.37]I'm not, I have shorts on, okay?
[155:24.17]I've got shorts on.
[155:27.89]I've got shorts on.
[155:29.05]I just, I'm a gamer.
[155:45.81]I'm gaming.
[155:47.02]I'm intensely gaming.
[156:00.57]I have to pee.
[156:01.05]I'll be back.
[156:06.95]When you're low, he can see you all the time.
[156:09.77]So that was bugging you even more.
[156:11.79]Oh, so that's how he ults you no matter what.
[156:14.61]Yep.
[156:16.66]I gotta pee.
[156:17.40]I'll be right back.
[156:18.94]Where's the picture of Jerma playing naked?
[156:21.14]You missed it.
[156:21.54]I put it up already.
[156:22.88]Where?
[156:24.00]Somebody will show you.
[156:25.26]It's not even a big deal.
[156:26.20]I'll be right back.
[156:28.19]First pick or not.
[156:29.21]Jerma.
[156:30.05]Jerma.
[156:31.03]I'll be right back.
[156:31.97]No.
[156:34.21]Picks shouldn't matter.
[156:35.16]To be honest.
[156:39.00]Okay.
[156:40.84]You all are just going to take whatever you want.
[156:42.60]And they're just going to do the same thing.
[156:44.32]He's playing butt naked.
[156:49.84]You got our second pick last game and the other games, right?
[156:53.15]I feel like we all have to go naked.
[156:54.87]Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like we have to take off our clothes.
[157:04.93]Oh yeah, when you're in lane, make sure you guys use your potions.
[157:08.74]Like, just if you're doing anything, just pop them if you're at all low HP.
[157:12.04]You don't need to be super low.
[157:19.10]Wait, sorry.
[157:19.56]What did you say?
[157:20.08]I zoned out for a second.
[157:21.08]When you're in lane, even if you're just a little low, like say you're at 80% health, just use your potions.
[157:25.55]Make sure you're potions.
[157:26.53]It's okay.
[157:26.81]I'd rather you waste them than just die.
[157:28.83]The Miskip skin is so ugly.
[157:32.27]It's definitely an odd skin.
[157:34.40]I don't know what you mean, but it's scary as hell looking.
[157:41.46]Oh, yeah, no, there's no going.
[157:44.50]Yeah, no, you're you when you buy by the desktop first, your second item, it builds into that transcendence item.
[157:52.01]It's called Morningstar, you want to buy like the tier one of that transcendence?
[157:57.69]Did I not do that?
[157:58.67]No, no, you bought you almost bought nothing, which would have fucking screwed you.
[158:03.05]By the desktop, then by that item, then by your potion.
[158:10.62]and he's part about it okay okay no go ahead the purification beads shouldn't cost anything they're free okay so desk toll how many potions uh it should be I think it's four or five yeah five yeah buy yeah buy the morning star and then just buy the you max out five potions and that's fine you can just buy no no no no by desk toll yeah desktop
[158:33.94]Second item is called Morningstar.
[158:35.48]It builds into the transcendence.
[158:37.56]So I can buy both of those?
[158:38.66]Yeah, the one's a starter and the other one is the tier one of your transcendence item.
[158:44.05]What are you eating?
[158:46.25]Some garlic.
[158:48.57]Oh, my bad.
[158:49.79]I did it.
[158:50.19]I put a Jerma.
[158:51.23]What'd you say?
[158:52.73]Someone asked what I was eating because I was eating an almond.
[158:55.45]I was about to tell them, but then I hotmacked.
[158:58.91]What are you eating?
[159:00.09]Can you tell me now?
[159:00.63]Almonds.
[159:02.45]Yeah, garlic, rosemary, almonds.
[159:04.63]Interesting.
[159:05.63]Russell, late game, you're super tanky, too.
[159:09.17]You can just run into the phoenixes and shit.
[159:10.61]Like, don't, like, tank for 10 minutes, but you can tank them for a little bit.
[159:14.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[159:14.73]That's what I was saying.
[159:16.65]Whenever we were, like, chilling at the phoenix, like, I could tank it a little bit until the minions come.
[159:20.20]Well, Russell, when you know we're stronger, you can just fucking go into the enemy team.
[159:25.88]Yeah.
[159:26.28]After 30 minutes, too, that Fire Giant, it'll make it so you kill the phoenixes instantly.
[159:30.02]Like, you just auto it once and it'll die.
[159:33.42]If you have a purple Fire Giant on your buff bar, you'll just kill everything You guys see the earn free rewards thing in game yeah watch ads bro That's cool We have to watch ads
[159:58.92]Jerma's thumbnail on Twitch.
[160:01.82]What is it?
[160:02.16]Probably him butt naked.
[160:09.84]Your thumbnail!
[160:19.85]Oh my god, it actually is.
[160:25.11]Wait, where is this picture?
[160:26.75]Go to your thumbnail on Twitch.
[160:29.99]Just look at the smite section.
[160:30.95]Yeah, look at the smite section.
[160:32.27]Huh?
[160:34.79]Mine?
[160:35.61]Yes.
[160:38.44]No.
[160:39.08]Oh, it's just him naked probably, right?
[160:42.38]Yeah, it's literally just him butt naked.
[160:45.76]He's talking about if you go to the smite section, you know there's a preview of the stream.
[160:49.11]Yeah.
[160:50.47]Yeah, it's a picture of you gaming.
[160:54.31]You're gaming right now.
[160:55.41]I haven't shown my shorts.
[160:56.67]I literally have shorts on.
[160:59.01]I don't know.
[160:59.45]The black box says otherwise.
[161:01.37]I have shorts on.
[161:04.11]You're going to have to prove it.
[161:05.20]You're going to have to take that black box away or else I think you're full naked right now.
[161:09.44]I don't see anything.
[161:10.82]Fuck!
[161:12.64]You missed out.
[161:13.96]I linked it in Discord.
[161:17.07]What I saw.
[161:18.35]I wanted to see fucking... All he wants to see is Jermacock right now.
[161:25.79]Okay, that's good.
[161:27.77]He's got booty.
[161:28.47]Yeah, that'd have to be big shorts.
[161:30.61]I'm not wearing baggy shorts.
[161:31.79]I'm just wearing shorts.
[161:32.55]I don't know.
[161:32.97]All I'm saying is that's a pretty big sensor bar.
[161:39.17]I appreciate the chesticles.
[161:44.89]I just leaked nothing.
[161:46.17]Okay, thank God.
[161:47.85]What'd you leak?
[161:49.47]Oh, God, nothing.
[161:50.45]Oh, I just leaked the password.
[161:52.11]Oh.
[161:52.93]No, I didn't.
[161:53.37]Thank God.
[161:55.56]How many times are you freaking out, man?
[161:57.28]Wait, who's our coach?
[161:58.59]Jerma or Weeknd?
[162:00.05]I'm the captain, but I don't know, whatever.
[162:03.95]Wait, who's the one making the videos?
[162:06.69]The guys.
[162:07.75]Jerma has videos too.
[162:10.23]Oh, no, you're talking about Jerma from 10 years ago.
[162:12.40]He was like way smarter than I am.
[162:14.94]Wait, what happened?
[162:17.08]No, because I'm over here asking questions and shit, but I was like, oh, we don't have a coach.
[162:20.20]But this guy, like, I can just ask him.
[162:24.53]Yeah, we got a coach.
[162:28.01]What happened to your intelligence, Jerma?
[162:29.59]It's me.
[162:30.11]I'm the coach.
[162:31.35]I got over 35 years old.
[162:34.30]So you're regressing?
[162:37.20]I mean, that's when you get older, man.
[162:39.44]What's it like at 35?
[162:42.22]Yo, look at the characters right now.
[162:44.14]Gods.
[162:45.13]Yeah.
[162:45.73]Look at Venom.
[162:48.35]And look at his third skin.
[162:56.43]Oh, yeah.
[162:57.93]That skin is as old as time, bro.
[163:00.21]That is really old, isn't it?
[163:01.85]That is the skin everyone used to wear.
[163:10.43]Well, I kind of had to prove it today because I always talk about how I don't I don't really wear that many clothes when I'm sitting around.
[163:17.95]Sometimes it'd be a pair of shorts or whatever, right?
[163:20.73]And people think I'm full of shit when I say that.
[163:22.95]Usually when I'm sitting here streaming, I just kind of don't really have any clothes on.
[163:26.69]So you're a forever nude.
[163:28.35]No, not where you partial Las Vegas, man.
[163:32.32]Oh, it's it's 120 degrees out.
[163:34.92]Isn't that what AC is for?
[163:37.26]Yeah, I mean, I have AC, but leave your car parked outside, right?
[163:41.66]Because your tires will melt.
[163:43.52]Yeah.
[163:45.52]Oh, yeah.
[163:46.22]No, I get it.
[163:48.94]I'm a forever clothed.
[163:54.98]Wait.
[163:56.57]Why do people believe in Team Tectone to win over Team Jerma?
[163:59.05]I don't know.
[164:00.48]I'm trying to figure that out myself.
[164:01.82]Wait, do people actually believe that?
[164:04.06]Wait, they've been playing for that long?
[164:05.64]Yeah, Tectones, I think, have only been playing Smite for the past week.
[164:08.28]Like, that's it.
[164:09.56]They've been playing a lot though, haven't they?
[164:11.68]Put them in my lane.
[164:12.86]Yeah, but Tectone... They beat Mendo's team, the one you guys just lost to.
[164:16.77]They like slaughtered them.
[164:18.25]Wait, what?
[164:19.37]Wait.
[164:22.11]Wait, what?
[164:22.89]You guys are better now.
[164:24.51]You guys are much better now.
[164:25.37]We are better now.
[164:26.27]That is true.
[164:26.65]If we lose the second game, are we out?
[164:28.47]Yes.
[164:29.49]Okay, well, I'll see you guys later then.
[164:32.10]Huh?
[164:32.92]No, we win.
[164:33.50]We win.
[164:33.82]We win.
[164:34.16]We win.
[164:34.54]We win.
[164:34.78]What's with all these quitters on my team, man?
[164:37.14]No, I don't understand.
[164:40.70]We have Shurfor, dude.
[164:41.76]No, we don't just have Shurfor.
[164:43.52]We have Shurfor.
[164:44.28]We have Jerma.
[164:44.95]We have Noko.
[164:45.65]We have Russell.
[164:46.73]We have Pokelawls.
[164:47.95]We have Weaken.
[164:48.69]We're going to win.
[164:50.06]I think we got it that is actually all we have yeah yep that is it exactly so if we lose this then we watch the rest of the tournament oh it's for who to watch not who to win oh never mind you think I'm gonna watch the rest of the tournament we're gonna win this for who to win did they spectate our game once or no I don't know I think what about the slipknot stuff yeah the slipknot stuff is um I think this game is gonna be interesting there's channel though on the stream
[165:22.03]Poseidon is a lot of it, right?
[165:24.41]If we lose this game, I'm going to Apex and solo queue ranked and getting depression.
[165:29.47]Same here.
[165:30.13]But we're not going to lose.
[165:31.08]We're not going to lose.
[165:31.72]That's the thing.
[165:32.56]I'm literally the plat gatekeeper.
[165:37.26]I fell out of bread.
[165:38.28]I'm dog shit.
[165:39.38]No.
[165:40.60]I'm perpetually diamond one.
[165:42.92]No.
[165:43.34]D4 plat one.
[165:44.36]D4 plat one.
[165:45.34]D4 plat one.
[165:46.36]Apparently, they watched the end of your last game too.
[165:48.06]So they can see you, Bob.
[165:49.68]Nice.
[165:53.05]Should I be the Stranger Things monster for this one?
[165:58.41]When are we starting?
[165:59.65]Should I switch my character or stick to what's working?
[166:02.63]Whatever you want, bro.
[166:03.91]Don't let your memes be dreams.
[166:05.29]If you don't know any other character better, then you should just stay.
[166:08.25]Is there going to be different animations for the new skins and stuff?
[166:11.80]No, I'm staying with the metal one.
[166:14.94]That'll fuck with me.
[166:21.64]I think we should just win.
[166:23.51]Yeah.
[166:24.47]Yeah, we should.
[166:25.01]That sounds like a good idea.
[166:26.67]Just win, Forehead.
[166:28.53]Okay, so let's do that, then.
[166:29.63]I think we have a pretty decent chance to just win.
[166:35.04]Forehead?
[166:35.78]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[166:37.12]We're all playing the same characters.
[166:38.18]Okay.
[166:39.26]So, Russell, you go in.
[166:41.22]Your ultimate is a pull?
[166:43.42]Yeah, it's like, well, it's like you start it off, and I have to get them in the circle, and then, like, the pull takes, like, I think four seconds or three seconds or something like that.
[166:50.93]It's one of the easiest ults in the game to beads.
[166:53.33]Yeah.
[166:54.25]That's the biggest problem.
[166:55.27]Like I can say I'm gonna pull them, but if they beads it, I don't pull them.
[166:58.60]You actually got two double kills because they beads it too early.
[167:02.80]Oh.
[167:03.48]Did they really?
[167:04.04]Yeah.
[167:04.64]Yeah, you did.
[167:06.00]That's kind of sad.
[167:08.00]Wait.
[167:08.20]How did they beads it too early?
[167:10.06]If you beads it before it actually pulls, it'll still pull though.
[167:14.26]If you beads it like way or like it fell.
[167:16.48]Yeah.
[167:16.70]The whole thing had fallen off.
[167:17.56]The beads had fallen off.
[167:19.68]Interesting.
[167:20.70]So... You pull.
[167:23.23]And then Surefour, what does your ult do?
[167:25.75]Dragon and a line that does a bunch of damage.
[167:28.32]Over issues right now.
[167:31.18]I'm just trying to figure out, right now what I'm trying to figure out is a combination.
[167:34.96]Kind of like Overwatch, right?
[167:36.08]Where like Zarya, Hanzo.
[167:37.70]Like, so you pull and then I ult, because my ult does damage and it silences.
[167:42.01]So they can't beads or anything.
[167:43.63]And then you, you dragon?
[167:45.89]Are you talking to me?
[167:46.43]Because I zoned out.
[167:50.22]What did you say?
[167:51.10]You need to get your head in the game.
[167:52.20]Let's see if Pete Mendo is team.
[167:54.24]I'm in the game.
[167:55.02]I'm sorry.
[167:56.14]What did you say?
[167:59.29]I don't remember.
[168:00.23]You don't even remember what you said?
[168:02.27]Wait.
[168:03.41]Hear me out.
[168:04.43]Wait.
[168:05.23]I got to think.
[168:05.95]This is where we go five Winstons in the middle.
[168:07.83]Yeah.
[168:12.24]Okay.
[168:16.82]What?
[168:17.22]Oh, boy.
[168:18.09]What the heck?
[168:19.31]You pull.
[168:20.31]Pull.
[168:21.15]I ult.
[168:21.82]He dragons.
[168:24.68]Wait.
[168:24.86]If you silence, your ult silences, right?
[168:27.12]Yes.
[168:27.50]My ult silences.
[168:28.52]Or I can silence into the... Wait.
[168:30.54]That means they can't beads, right?
[168:32.41]No.
[168:32.57]They can... I think you can still beads when you're silenced.
[168:37.14]That's just stupid.
[168:37.84]What's the point of silencing?
[168:39.72]So you can't use abilities.
[168:41.81]You don't use them all together, usually.
[168:43.51]Like, if they get pulled, drop your shit where they get pulled, but you're kind of using them separately to make them beads.
[168:48.75]So one of you all should hit.
[168:50.99]Wait.
[168:51.81]That makes sense.
[168:52.45]Yeah, you can beads while you're silenced, right?
[168:54.03]Is that what you're saying?
[168:55.67]Yeah.
[168:56.59]The order that you sent me, Weekend, is that the order that I build in?
[169:00.80]Yes.
[169:01.22]Exactly.
[169:01.86]Okay.
[169:02.14]Alright.
[169:09.83]Tyra's server is getting DDoSed right now.
[169:11.57]I don't know.
[169:13.29]I don't think they're getting DDoSed.
[169:14.83]Maybe there's so many people playing right now that... I think they're fixing them.
[169:19.08]They just reset.
[169:22.20]Is this normal in Smite?
[169:23.52]Yes.
[169:24.66]Every night while I'm streaming, it happens.
[169:28.22]Every night?
[169:29.20]Yeah.
[169:29.46]Ever since like COVID, when everyone started playing Smite's player base doubled, I think it's a code problem with their logins and they can't even fix it.
[169:37.36]Oh, it's spaghetti code.
[169:38.82]Yep.
[169:40.38]because the games don't crash like if I'm in a game I'm fine but I'm not in a booster seat I'm not in a booster seat in the picture I have that's a Herman Miller m body chair and it's fucking phenomenal okay the booster everyone's saying I'm in a booster seat no that's that's I'm in that's a Herman Miller well we can't tell because there's a giant black box by Herman Miller
[170:02.54]No, they gave me the chair, but... Those chairs suck.
[170:06.21]What?
[170:06.45]Those chairs suck.
[170:09.81]Why are you saying that?
[170:12.01]Their armrests are doggers.
[170:14.67]I like the Aeron armrests more than I like the Embodies, because the Aeron has that cushion, that little squishy, squishy.
[170:21.68]I think the... I like the back crank, the thing where you go like... You want to make it tighter?
[170:27.46]Yeah, no, I love it.
[170:28.80]That was ASMR as fuck.
[170:30.96]No, I love it.
[170:31.60]I think it's great.
[170:32.72]Yeah, but can anyone purr?
[170:35.61]I don't think anyone's going to want to do that.
[170:39.57]I'm not sure anybody's going to want to do those sounds.
[170:45.19]We should try joining now, apparently.
[170:46.75]Are we alright?
[170:47.19]We can do it?
[170:48.57]Yeah.
[170:50.20]Alright.
[170:50.70]So let's go for it.
[170:53.58]Alright, play.
[170:54.16]Are you guys ready?
[170:56.62]I just chugged some water.
[170:57.62]I just had an Oreo milkshake.
[171:00.56]Whose game are we joining?
[171:02.46]Thanks for the reminder.
[171:03.94]I think it's Tectone's if he ever puts it up.
[171:06.83]What's Tectone's?
[171:08.57]I don't know.
[171:09.25]I don't know his endgame.
[171:15.74]We're on the broadcast.
[171:17.58]Oh.
[171:18.64]Can they hear us?
[171:19.76]Hey, guys.
[171:21.65]My name is Jerma.
[171:23.47]And my friends in the team.
[171:26.19]What the fuck, Team Pat?
[171:27.97]Didn't sound confident.
[171:29.27]I'm going to play a little bit safe.
[171:35.36]Where's Russell?
[171:37.00]Where's that freaking yoked up Jerma I saw in the picture?
[171:42.18]Yoked up?
[171:43.12]Wait, do you mean like
[171:45.28]Never heard that before.
[171:46.08]Yeah, I wouldn't say yoked up.
[171:48.00]I'd say more like cottage cheesed up.
[171:51.33]Cottage cheesed up?
[171:54.73]I didn't see any drooping.
[171:57.41]I'm sitting in a chair.
[172:00.93]Yeah, but you know, like old people have like their skin starts sagging.
[172:05.48]I got pretty good posture to anything.
[172:08.34]I'd have to relook.
[172:15.24]What's wrong with you?
[172:18.12]Where do we start?
[172:21.40]I'm too green tea deep right now.
[172:23.34]Two green teas?
[172:24.70]I'm too green tea deep right now.
[172:26.66]Are you actually?
[172:27.26]Oh my god.
[172:28.76]See, you gotta slow down.
[172:30.49]I just ate this Oreo milkshake and it was delicious.
[172:33.71]Yeah, now you're gonna get the sugar rush.
[172:37.34]Lord knows I need that.
[172:38.30]Should I get another green tea?
[172:39.80]Should we go three green teas for three matches?
[172:41.66]I could get yoked up, bro.
[172:43.54]Should I get fucking cheddar cheesed up?
[172:46.34]Get juiced up, bruh.
[172:47.92]Jerma just starts calming everything.
[172:50.47]That's a serious question.
[172:53.71]Jerma, how do you fall asleep?
[172:57.25]Do you sleep with the TV on?
[173:00.03]Yeah, usually iPad.
[173:01.33]I have an iPad on my chest and I just kind of watch whatever and then fall asleep.
[173:04.81]Wait, what?
[173:06.11]Really?
[173:06.37]Yeah.
[173:06.95]Unless somebody walks in the room and just finds you, like, wake you up, uses an iPad right in your chest.
[173:12.11]Yeah, I mean, do you think that picture was weird?
[173:14.99]This picture's of me asleep with just random videos of the shit that we've shown.
[173:18.63]Alright, I think we're good to go.
[173:20.33]But where is the match?
[173:22.46]Are they trying to get you guys to make?
[173:24.58]Are we making the game?
[173:25.82]Hold on.
[173:28.34]We're supposed to be second pick, so I don't know why you'd be making the game.
[173:32.82]Unless I don't see their name.
[173:36.37]I see Emeru's game.
[173:38.41]Strippin is the host.
[173:40.05]Okay, so that's Strippin.
[173:42.33]Is that the same password?
[173:44.40]Wait, Strippin's playing?
[173:45.90]Yeah.
[173:46.48]I love Strippin.
[173:46.92]Strippin's on TicTone's tune.
[173:48.04]Yeah, I love Strippin too.
[173:49.30]He dropped the password in the chat.
[173:51.24]Yeah.
[173:52.78]Alright, we're going.
[173:53.26]I love Strippin.
[173:53.74]I'm going to kill him though.
[173:54.92]Can you read that password out loud for me?
[173:58.25]Yeah.
[173:59.01]I'm trying to think of something funny to say, but I don't want to even be somewhat similar.
[174:05.54]You know, I guess the password, like, 12 years ago to, like, a League of Legends tournament that was streamed.
[174:11.23]Really?
[174:11.63]Yeah, it was, like, TSM versus CLG, and I got in.
[174:14.85]It was, like, a random, like, Alienware tournament, and I got in, and they didn't kick me out, and I played.
[174:20.72]I cannot join.
[174:22.74]I cannot join that game, by the way.
[174:24.12]Which team did you play for?
[174:26.01]I think CLG went against TSM, yeah.
[174:30.17]No one on CLG went like, hey, that's not our player, bro.
[174:36.21]When I do password and hit go, it just doesn't happen.
[174:39.08]They didn't give a fuck.
[174:41.74]You might need to re-log or re-make your party.
[174:43.88]Re-make the party?
[174:45.02]Yeah.
[174:45.82]I'm going to re-log.
[174:47.82]Alright, restart the game.
[174:49.88]Thanks again.
[174:53.28]There's a black screen here.
[174:54.20]I'm sorry.
[174:55.64]I don't forgive you.
[174:58.47]I do.
[175:00.65]I hope you did.
[175:02.23]You're welcome.
[175:04.87]I just saw the Jerm of pitcher.
[175:07.03]You're sleeping to XTC.
[175:10.63]That's not edited, by the way.
[175:11.97]I actually was watching that.
[175:14.18]Did you post in the chat?
[175:15.02]Okay.
[175:15.30]I linked it.
[175:16.54]Wait, wait.
[175:17.36]Oh, my God.
[175:20.94]That's exactly how I imagined you would look like.
[175:24.64]What do you mean?
[175:26.90]Like sleeping with a computer on your chest.
[175:31.95]Is that the juicer?
[175:33.55]I thought it would fall over though.
[175:36.45]You stay completely still?
[175:38.31]I get it.
[175:38.99]I just do a corpse and just don't move.
[175:42.05]It's kind of weird.
[175:42.82]How?
[175:43.50]I don't know.
[175:43.90]This dude, you love some gamba streams, bro.
[175:47.44]If you sleep on your back, you get sleep paralysis, guys.
[175:51.26]Excuse me.
[175:52.62]I love my juicer, okay?
[175:53.90]I don't care what he's doing.
[175:55.67]Good.
[175:55.93]That's what we like to hear.
[175:58.31]No wonder you're always juiced up on green tea.
[176:03.78]Yeah, we can't wait where I'm stuck in our authenticating Poggers Where's that you should play games with the juicer?
[176:17.00]Alright, but Man, it's busy guy.
[176:20.76]I'll get it happening I'll get my guy to talk to my guy I'm in How did you get in
[176:31.34]Let's just play five man Among Us.
[176:32.88]I'll get my guy.
[176:34.54]Among Us.
[176:35.78]Six man Among Us.
[176:40.07]I would turn my face cam off.
[176:41.43]We all know I can't do that.
[176:43.19]Yeah, you can.
[176:46.25]You can be shirtless on stream.
[176:49.74]Yeah, but I... No.
[176:53.06]What do you mean, no?
[176:54.06]Wait, are we doing the last game in Among Us?
[176:56.04]Is that what you said?
[176:56.68]Yeah.
[176:58.04]Yeah.
[177:00.29]It's 5v5 among us.
[177:02.52]Yeah.
[177:04.22]The smite tournament.
[177:05.32]That's actually the bracket.
[177:06.38]The bracket is among us.
[177:08.01]That's when we start the serious games.
[177:11.89]Tell them you're the sus guy.
[177:13.11]Guys, they don't care.
[177:16.42]Does anybody in this call give a shit that I'm the sus guy?
[177:19.92]Nope.
[177:20.92]Please.
[177:21.32]I was part of the eight Harbingers.
[177:24.18]Nobody cares.
[177:26.06]I'm just saying they made a news article about me for being one of the best imposters.
[177:31.75]Literally everyone cares that I was one of the eight Harbingers.
[177:34.23]I don't know what you're talking about.
[177:38.43]Yeah, Among Us did that update and got too difficult for me, so.
[177:42.81]Yeah, but 3D Among Us is coming out soon, so.
[177:49.39]I just forgot we're doing nothing.
[177:51.03]Can you get re-invited?
[177:54.09]We can't even get in.
[177:55.09]The server's messed up.
[177:56.33]I got in.
[177:56.89]Oh, you got in?
[177:57.33]Yeah, I got in.
[177:59.73]I figured we were doing stuff.
[178:00.93]I was just chilling.
[178:01.57]How come VR Among Us didn't take off?
[178:03.85]I thought that was way more entertaining.
[178:04.97]No, they're making VR.
[178:05.97]Oh, yeah.
[178:07.94]Wait.
[178:08.40]That was VRChat.
[178:10.70]VRChat, yeah.
[178:13.38]Which is probably better than the game.
[178:14.48]Who knows?
[178:15.08]Yeah, it was sick.
[178:16.84]Yeah, we'll find out.
[178:18.30]Yeah.
[178:18.50]I don't know.
[178:20.54]We were so hot off that last game that we're cooling down here.
[178:23.82]This is not good.
[178:24.36]Yeah, they're throwing.
[178:25.96]It's actually good because, you know, I feel like I peed, so I kind of reset.
[178:29.81]And now, like, I feel stronger.
[178:32.55]You play worse after you pee.
[178:34.21]You know that.
[178:35.45]Oh, fuck.
[178:36.55]I'm the one who said that.
[178:37.85]Fellas.
[178:38.71]Fellas, I'm going for three green teas.
[178:40.47]I'm going fucking crazy right now.
[178:42.39]Bro, you need to calm down, man.
[178:43.77]Yeah, I'm going for it.
[178:45.82]You're about to pass a stone, brother.
[178:48.12]It's green tea.
[178:48.84]It's good for you.
[178:49.58]Don't wish that upon anybody, bro.
[178:52.88]I didn't wish it upon you, man.
[178:54.96]I bet he puts sugar in it.
[178:57.30]No, no.
[178:58.38]No, I actually, yeah.
[179:01.50]Sometimes.
[179:01.92]How do you get from saying no to actually, yeah?
[179:03.80]Well, because it depends on the day.
[179:04.92]Sometimes I just have like matcha powder.
[179:07.50]Were you going to lie to us?
[179:09.35]Well, sometimes.
[179:11.13]No, please don't say that anymore.
[179:13.31]I don't want to be that guy anymore.
[179:16.83]Alright, let's see if I can get some of you guys in here.
[179:18.73]Look at his feet!
[179:21.04]What was that noise?

[180:29.85]I'll shower.
[180:30.39]I'll shower too.
[180:32.13]I was just going to say because if you just squirt it while you're pooping it, you poop faster.

[181:48.71]Dude, there's no green tea.
[181:49.71]He's just taking a massive bong hit.
[181:53.77]That's the poke method.

[182:19.04]Yeah, that's exactly it, actually, Poke.
[182:20.86]I hate hearing your fucking voice.
[182:22.19]You're so stupid.
[182:23.45]And honestly, I'm going to punch you in your face next time I see you.
[182:25.49]Is that what you wanted to hear?
[182:26.63]He can't even reach me, bro.
[182:28.15]I'm taller than your ass.
[182:29.27]Okay, that was kind of rude.
[182:31.19]That was actually really rude.
[182:33.97]You were going to physically hurt me.
[182:36.56]I didn't say that.
[182:37.22]You will be hurt.
[182:38.40]Did I say that?
[182:39.14]I don't think I said that.
[182:39.90]You will be hurt.
[182:40.80]You said you're going to punch me.
[182:42.46]Dude, you're acting crazy.
[182:43.62]I'm Twitch reporting you.
[182:47.47]Partner on partner.
[182:48.25]That's fucked up.
[182:49.81]I got you.
[182:50.63]Chill, chill.
[182:55.53]Okay, let's do this, baby.
[182:59.33]I just searched the app.
[183:06.59]That first character they picked has a bit of salt that sucks you into them and then abilities and a route Those guys I'm good.
[183:17.19]I'm good.
[183:17.49]I'm here seem like they place my I'm good.
[183:19.77]I'm good No, I'm good, huh I fucking
[183:31.34]Did you just have someone inside of you or something?
[183:33.84]Yes, I popped the stream open.
[183:36.24]I was like, I wonder if we're gonna start soon.
[183:38.34]And I fucking, I knew I had to pick.
[183:39.96]Why don't you just... That's the type of player we like.
[183:45.14]Now I'm gonna play insane because I need to poop.
[183:47.96]Wait, you didn't poop?
[183:49.76]I like half pooped.
[183:52.22]Hey, honestly, man.
[183:53.70]This is a $100,000 tournament.
[183:54.74]Just shit in your pants.
[183:55.68]You can buy a new fucking pair of pants.
[183:58.64]That's a good point.
[183:59.72]It's true.
[184:01.88]Like, if we're in the middle of the last team fight and we might win the tournament, you could buy a new rug.
[184:08.24]Who's better here, Ullr or Artemis?
[184:10.96]Artemis.
[184:11.36]I mean, you're better with Artemis as well.
[184:13.64]You don't know that.
[184:14.70]You don't know that.
[184:15.54]You don't know that.
[184:16.40]You're warmed.
[184:17.00]You're warmed.
[184:21.52]You don't know that.
[184:22.12]This guy's turtle heading, bro.
[184:31.07]You would genuinely play better if you just let it all go Is that just me Earlier Kali jungle.
[184:41.02]Yeah, but but that's for pooping.
[184:43.36]It's different like you're you keister that you're not gonna feel good This is uh, if we lose how many more games we have I
[184:53.27]This is the last one.
[184:54.19]Yeah, I think this is the last one.
[184:55.97]You win, you keep going.
[184:57.07]I think if you lose, you're done.
[184:58.04]But there's no website or anything to check.
[185:02.18]Is anybody out already?
[185:03.18]I think you go to semis and then the winner that goes to finals, I assume.
[185:11.55]Alright.
[185:12.51]How many teams even are in this tournament?
[185:14.11]Yeah.
[185:14.25]Is anybody out already?
[185:15.05]Four?
[185:15.87]I don't... I don't... I mean, I'm sure somebody is.
[185:18.77]I think there's four, no?
[185:20.63]Well, if someone's 0 and 2, they have to be out.
[185:22.31]There's two groups of four.
[185:23.65]And there's four people per group.
[185:30.87]Yep.
[185:31.72]So if we come in, like, fourth or fifth place, that means we get... We still... We're still able to get maybe, like, three to four dollars each, right?
[185:39.63]Nope.
[185:41.53]Oh.
[185:42.65]Nope, just four.
[186:11.58]What is Baron's other abilities besides his ult?
[186:15.96]His two is a circle and if it hits on you, it will heal his team and does damage to you.
[186:20.58]His one is like a crisscross line ability that does damage and then his three, he throws it out.
[186:25.42]If it hits you, it sticks to you and slows you and then roots you after a second.
[186:28.56]Nice.
[186:29.18]Who am I playing against?
[186:30.12]Kali?
[186:31.21]You're gonna be against that bear and the top guy.
[186:33.43]Probably.
[186:34.03]Is he... What is... Oh.
[186:35.25]That switched.
[186:35.85]That or you're gonna be against the turtle.
[186:38.07]One or the other.
[186:38.90]Which one's... What does he do?
[186:41.04]So if the top guy's a mage or the bottom guy, Baron, he's a mage.
[186:45.74]Like I said, he has damaging abilities and he has root.
[186:50.35]He doesn't have any movement though.
[186:51.47]Like he can't like blink away or anything like that.
[186:53.79]Oh, so I can fuck him.
[186:54.81]Yeah, the turtle has a dash and if he hits you, he can push you.
[186:57.55]His ultimate will knock you up a bunch of times.
[187:00.27]And then he has a little turtle he can throw at you.
[187:03.11]And he has an ability that will make him glow.
[187:05.45]And if he glows, he reflects damage.
[187:07.05]Like if you auto him, it'll reflect damage.
[187:09.03]Oh, so I shouldn't hit him when he glows.
[187:10.15]Yeah, it also lowers his cooldowns too.
[187:11.77]Alright, I gotta go.
[187:12.51]Good luck, boys.
[187:13.51]Good luck.
[187:14.07]Let's do it.
[187:15.13]What do you mean good luck?
[187:16.31]We need the luck, not him.
[187:18.95]Well, he has to watch us.
[187:20.45]Oh, that's true.
[187:21.45]I think we're in a good position here, I think.
[187:24.50]Why is everyone's border so cool?
[187:26.94]I'm nervous.
[187:27.76]Because they play the character a lot.
[187:30.40]That guy has 2016 smite.
[187:32.94]I have beta tester, bro.
[187:35.84]Oh, never mind.
[187:36.30]We're chillin'.
[187:37.20]Yeah.
[187:38.44]I was actually in the alpha of this game.
[187:41.40]Is that legit or are you just saying that?
[187:43.24]It's like a completely different game now.
[187:46.39]This is unfair matchmaking.
[187:49.37]Yeah, they couldn't change the teams.
[187:51.03]Why don't we just have Jerma play Anubis?
[187:54.16]I mean, I have a diamond level 10 Anubis.
[187:57.36]I'm surprised.
[187:59.36]So I bet that's not, I didn't make a joke or anything.
[188:02.52]What did I say that was funny?
[188:03.34]No, I know.
[188:04.86]It's just like, I have a diamond level 10 Anubis.
[188:08.58]Like the game would have been over if I was on Anubis.
[188:10.88]I just don't understand why that's a funny joke.
[188:12.72]That's not, I wasn't trying to be funny.
[188:17.04]Sometimes that's the best way to be funny, isn't it?
[188:19.04]When you're not even trying to.
[188:20.16]It is mildly funny, especially since Surefour's laughing.
[188:22.74]It does make me want to laugh.
[188:24.68]See?
[188:25.17]See?
[188:25.55]Surefour does have a contagious laugh.
[188:27.41]Thank you.
[188:28.23]How did everyone laugh?
[188:29.09]I'm smiling.
[188:30.27]Hey, by the way, I went, I practiced yesterday in the afternoon with Anubis.
[188:35.01]And just like, oh, just in case, maybe I might play it.
[188:37.49]I didn't know what, I had no idea what the setup was going to be.
[188:41.50]I didn't land one mummify in five games.
[188:44.68]Oh.
[188:45.14]It was awful.
[188:46.16]So I was like, oh shit, hopefully I don't have to play this character.
[188:49.52]Well, good thing I guess it worked out then.
[188:51.53]Yeah.
[188:51.93]Wait, he said buy Death's Embrace and something else.
[188:55.33]Death's Toll.
[188:57.25]Death's Toll.
[188:58.23]He has it in the Discord.
[188:59.55]It's Death's Toll and Morningstar.
[189:01.49]Morningstar.
[189:02.09]That's what it was.
[189:03.68]Oh, yeah.
[189:03.96]You and Polk have the same build.
[189:05.30]Perfect.
[189:07.94]Alright.
[189:08.30]You guys ready?
[189:09.86]My relic.
[189:10.64]My relic.
[189:12.94]Guys, be careful for the Invade.
[189:17.44]Russell, you ready to win?
[189:21.90]Yeah, mommy.
[189:24.92]Call me puppy.
[189:26.94]Yeah, puppy.
[189:29.01]How do you guys like your eggs?
[189:31.23]Scrambled.
[189:33.50]Sunny side, but if it has the egg cum stuff on the top, I don't like it.
[189:37.54]You know what I'm talking about?
[189:42.25]What?
[189:42.61]It has to be cooked perfectly.
[189:43.81]Sorry.
[189:44.71]I only like eggs if it's with something.
[189:47.43]Okay, well, over medium is what I like.
[189:50.75]No, it's about to spawn.
[189:52.71]Oh my god, guys.
[189:53.55]This is a hard team.
[189:54.97]We're going to face this hard team.
[189:58.01]Yeah, but I look like a god right now.
[190:00.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[190:02.55]That's what I'm saying.
[190:04.03]You look really cool.
[190:05.83]Thank you.
[190:06.69]You like my skin?
[190:08.23]That's all that matters.
[190:09.19]Win or lose.
[190:09.81]I said it was a classic.
[190:11.19]Yeah, but I wanted to hear it again.
[190:13.53]I need the validation.
[190:18.47]I'm not saying it again.
[190:20.48]I'm not going to say it again.
[190:22.06]I'm in the morale already, huh, Pokey?
[190:23.64]I don't care.
[190:25.66]Wait, where's the... oh.
[190:27.64]I'm playing Baron.
[190:28.74]Alright, now go in through this way.
[190:32.92]This way.
[190:33.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[190:35.80]Wait, we're actually kind of popping off.
[190:39.07]You just blocked me?
[190:39.67]I lost the minion?
[190:41.37]No, we didn't.
[190:41.83]We're good.
[190:51.55]There's like a turtle here.
[190:53.47]What is this?
[190:54.03]What did he put above my head?
[190:56.31]Yeah, he's being rude.
[190:57.89]I'm gonna ward actually.
[191:00.14]Yeah, I have wards too.
[191:03.94]Good luck!
[191:05.30]Thank you.
[191:10.11]Okay, we're doing damage.
[191:18.00]Yeah, we need level 3, then we pressure right side with traps.
[191:21.44]Mid's missing right now.
[191:22.72]Mid's missing already?
[191:23.46]Damn, okay.
[191:24.76]Okay, that could be... He went left side.
[191:27.83]What is this?
[191:28.85]It's his turtle.
[191:29.61]I don't know what to do.
[191:30.95]I warded deep in the jungle.
[191:37.47]Yeah, mid's back mid.
[191:39.33]And they're junglers mid too.
[191:40.85]Huh.
[191:42.45]If they're junglers mid, that means we're probably good to get... Dude, I'm killing this thing.
[191:45.76]I'll kill it for you.
[191:47.84]They're like clearing camps together.
[191:49.48]Are they still in the lane?
[191:56.02]They went right side.
[191:57.29]They might be ganking.
[191:58.17]Yeah, watch right side.
[192:03.41]Are they just staying in lane together?
[192:06.09]I don't know.
[192:07.72]They keep clearing and then going and farming and then clearing.
[192:11.66]Push right side.
[192:12.20]I need to get level 3.
[192:15.50]Level 3.
[192:15.88]I'm going to get out.
[192:17.36]I see that Kali.
[192:19.02]I'm pushing.
[192:19.44]Fuck it.
[192:19.68]I see that Kali.
[192:20.20]She's going to push the jungle.
[192:21.14]If you want to come counter gank.
[192:22.98]He's going to do something.
[192:24.80]Alright.
[192:27.19]Back up.
[192:27.45]Back up.
[192:29.43]Alright.
[192:30.55]Let's see.
[192:30.81]Why a lane minion came to me?
[192:32.95]I'm going to push again.
[192:33.73]Yeah, because you hit it.
[192:34.61]You got mad again.
[192:35.63]No, he's not.
[192:36.73]Poke.
[192:36.91]I'm going in.
[192:37.27]I'm going in.
[192:43.80]Alright, back up.
[192:45.28]Wait, what is that?
[192:46.84]Oh, that's his ability.
[192:50.94]We're doing damage, though.
[192:51.76]It's kind of good.
[192:55.24]Hello.
[192:56.76]Hey, governor.
[192:57.74]Tip of the morning to you.
[192:58.90]Are they both gone again?
[193:00.10]Wait, wait, my ward's missing.
[193:01.19]Yeah, she's probably getting his red.
[193:02.81]I'm the ward behind us, actually, instead of in front.
[193:05.03]I had to take the kills.
[193:06.81]I warded on the camp.
[193:13.68]I don't know.
[193:14.64]She just keeps soaking mid XP.
[193:18.44]They're going left side.
[193:19.58]Mid and jungle are going left side.
[193:21.48]Yep.
[193:22.46]Do you want to take a camp maybe?
[193:24.64]We can do right side.
[193:25.20]We can do right.
[193:27.32]Let's try it.
[193:28.82]Careful over there.
[193:30.29]Yeah, check left side.
[193:32.05]Be careful.
[193:32.39]Okay, mid's back mid.
[193:35.53]Nice, nice.
[193:36.17]That's actually big for us.
[193:38.53]I keep starting the wrong thing.
[193:39.71]If that Agni pushes up, I might jump on him.
[193:44.25]Although Agni can get away pretty easily.
[193:46.47]He's got a wolves.
[193:49.47]I'm going in.
[193:54.16]That's alright.
[193:55.46]Yeah.
[193:56.72]Yeah, they really are kind of hanging out here together.
[193:58.28]I'm going to go buy.
[193:59.54]I'm making a base.
[194:06.97]15.
[194:07.09]Ah, shit.
[194:07.81]1550 is what I need, not 1500.
[194:08.67]Shit.
[194:08.99]Want me to gank mid with you?
[194:13.19]There's an item you can get that lets you keep you two towers I
[194:38.79]Alright, let's go.
[194:41.05]She just said, OK, go around, go around.
[194:44.57]We're actually just sitting there.
[194:46.35]Oh, yeah.
[194:47.23]Well, let's push this for real quick.
[194:50.11]They're going left side now.

[194:56.27]Mids mid.
[194:59.49]I want to do a fight.
[195:00.95]I don't know.
[195:02.23]Possibly.
[195:05.05]I'm down.
[195:06.43]I don't know what their ults do though.
[195:08.39]I don't know how strong they are.
[195:13.07]I got ult down.
[195:13.99]There's too many minions.
[195:14.71]I might miss.
[195:15.49]Yeah, that's fine.
[195:18.81]Thank you for doing that.
[195:19.37]Yeah, that's what I'm supposed to be doing.
[195:22.26]I unfortunately have been pretty inconsistent with it.
[195:24.74]They have more items.
[195:25.22]They have more items.
[195:26.68]Let's B now so we can come back for the right side.

[195:35.08]Oh, yep.
[195:35.54]Okay, two.
[195:37.53]They're not the healthiest.
[195:39.43]We might be able to do something here.

[195:41.43]They're coming in on you.
[195:43.69]Wait.
[195:45.03]I'm here.

[201:47.15]Objective, objective, objective!
[201:48.44]Can we do Fire Giant or no?
[201:49.62]Yeah, we can do Fire Giant, I think.
[201:50.76]I'll sort it, I'll sort it.
[201:52.52]I have no health, I have no health.
[201:53.52]I should have aggroed it.
[201:54.84]It's going to do a lot of damage.
[201:56.57]Yeah, it's going to do a lot.
[201:57.75]We can try.
[201:58.13]Might as well, right?
[201:59.47]Yeah, you can back out whenever it's looking good.

[202:18.56]I'm trying to kill him.
[202:20.86]Oh, my God.
[202:21.36]Why did you guys leave?
[202:22.62]Wait, and our tower got destroyed right side.
[202:24.76]Okay.
[202:25.38]Yeah, that was not smart.
[202:33.85]You guys should have not bailed and just hit it.
[202:36.99]I was dead, dude.
[202:38.39]I did.
[202:38.91]I did.
[202:39.23]Well, did we just lose?
[202:42.40]No.
[202:42.60]I think we just... Because they didn't get any of the gold.
[202:45.38]They got tower, though.
[202:47.46]That's so fucking funny.
[202:49.12]And now they're getting harpy.
[202:50.86]Oh, god, dude.
[202:51.50]What the hell?
[202:53.04]It doesn't matter.
[202:53.82]It's fine.
[202:55.80]We just needed to not leave.
[202:58.32]Michael I think we should have waited for you to get there too.
[203:02.33]Yeah, probably I was at like 30% health when it started and I was just dead It's alright, hey, hey Don't go jungle.
[203:11.39]We're doing good Yeah, we're doing fine.
[203:15.36]Everything's good.
[203:15.94]Everything's good.
[203:17.26]Just keep winning team fights.
[203:18.42]Keep keep fucking them up Yeah, we just need to push out towers poke and then just rotate.
[203:23.73]Oh
[203:26.06]Or push out the minions and then rotate, because then we win every fight.
[203:28.76]Wait, where are we?
[203:32.58]I don't know my jump, shit.
[203:33.52]Oops.
[203:33.66]I was getting the purple.
[203:39.57]That's so funny.
[203:40.61]That was like a fucking Warcraft raid.
[203:43.31]Don't worry.
[203:44.71]Apparently, that happened to Tectone's team as well.
[203:48.79]That's so funny.
[203:50.41]I'm doing the right side alone.
[203:51.50]Where are you?
[203:51.84]Where are you?
[203:52.86]Agni's missing.
[203:54.08]Agni's missing.
[203:56.86]You gotta call it out when you're going, brother.
[203:58.66]I thought you said right side.
[203:59.88]I don't know what I heard, man.
[204:03.96]I think he's doing the side traps.
[204:07.98]We're good, we're good.
[204:08.64]Oh wait, he's like left side jungle.
[204:13.06]He just ran on my ward.
[204:14.06]Yeah, you got him.
[204:21.91]I thought they were with two or three people.
[204:23.39]Yeah, watch out.
[204:23.79]Be careful.
[204:24.05]You don't want to get jumped on.
[204:25.15]They're trying to jump on me.
[204:27.17]That shit fucking hurts.
[204:28.48]Oh my god.
[204:28.90]Oh, it does.
[204:29.40]Yeah, Kali's mid.
[204:48.37]Where they pushed up for it all?
[204:50.53]I can try to jump on them.
[204:52.77]They went to your left.
[204:53.77]Yep.
[204:54.79]Trying to get the Scorpion.
[204:55.39]They're doing the Scorpion.
[204:56.49]Yeah, he's trying to fucking kill me.
[204:58.19]I'm going to come right side.
[205:00.80]They're being aggro as hell.
[205:04.24]They're going to be aggro right now.
[205:05.28]We should back off.
[205:06.72]I think they know you're coming.
[205:07.56]They had minions and everything, so let's back off.
[205:10.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[205:11.55]You guys are coming right side?
[205:13.21]We're just gonna check in.
[205:14.53]Yeah, they're here.
[205:15.81]They're coming to you guys.
[205:16.43]They're coming to you guys.
[205:17.27]Yeah, they're here.
[205:18.65]We're here.
[205:21.17]If they push.
[205:23.04]He got my tower.
[205:25.96]He's outleveling the shit out of me.
[205:27.30]Oh, shit.
[205:28.08]Can I get a purple?
[205:30.70]Can you do it alone or should I help?
[205:32.14]Yeah, I got it.
[205:34.04]I'm going to red.
[205:35.20]I'm gonna push out minions.
[205:36.43]I have to go buy.
[205:45.82]Oh shit!
[205:48.16]Oh, they're coming on you?
[205:50.03]Yeah.
[205:50.21]Alright, coming, coming, coming.
[205:51.27]I'm dead.
[205:52.85]They knew.
[205:54.81]Fuck.
[205:59.93]I don't want to get caught here, but... We can probably do this.
[206:03.77]Is that mid?
[206:10.58]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[206:14.16]I'm here.
[206:14.56]I'm here.
[206:14.82]Oh, no.
[206:15.08]Oh, they're all one shot.
[206:15.84]Oh, no.
[206:16.06]I wouldn't have killed him anyways if I didn't.
[206:18.30]Wait, do we win or are you backing off?
[206:20.32]What is that?
[206:22.48]I'm on my ult.
[206:22.96]Okay.
[206:25.08]Fuck.
[206:25.58]Fuck.
[206:41.55]Okay.
[206:43.27]I only got one on that ult.
[206:45.72]Yeah, if you got the Baron, that would have been a kill.
[206:48.34]Yeah.
[206:51.72]I'm coming back, Poke.
[206:53.66]Yeah, I just couldn't get him.
[206:55.68]I couldn't kill him.
[206:57.08]It's okay.
[206:57.69]Oh, he's jumping on me right now.
[206:58.77]I think he ages, so that's how he got away.
[207:00.17]You're alone, but I'm coming.
[207:02.03]Oh, yeah, the Kali and Aegis come out with a lot of damage.
[207:04.51]I'm here.
[207:04.81]I can't reach him, though.
[207:07.87]Yeah, I can't reach him.
[207:10.58]Damn it.
[207:11.38]He tried it, though.
[207:11.88]You see that?
[207:12.92]Yeah, you fucked him up.
[207:14.88]That ward's about to die and I forgot to buy new ones.
[207:16.76]Oh, they're both low.
[207:17.86]My ult's up in 25 if they don't back.
[207:20.71]I'm warding.
[207:22.89]Oh, I'm here, I'm here.
[207:25.23]Careful, their entire team's going to go over to you.
[207:27.21]What is that?
[207:30.20]Oh, Agni's mid.
[207:30.84]We're chilling.
[207:33.20]Fuck.
[207:34.28]Damn it.
[207:34.80]I should have...
[207:37.58]They're coming, they're coming, they're coming.
[207:41.29]We're good.
[207:42.03]That's why they're pushing, that's why they're pushing.
[207:46.87]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[207:49.17]Drop this blue for us.
[207:50.89]If they push, I have ult, just saying.
[207:54.17]I'm going to get out of these mid camps here.
[208:04.24]I have 1800 gold, I'm going to back.
[208:05.18]Never mind, they're gone.
[208:07.14]You're going to be alone.
[208:07.66]You're going to be alone.
[208:08.16]I'm backing.
[208:08.92]Actually, let's take this right side first.
[208:10.36]Yeah.
[208:13.10]Oh, sorry.
[208:15.82]I'm coming right.
[208:17.56]Well, we're not there.
[208:18.82]Yeah, I can.
[208:19.46]I can see them.
[208:19.78]I can see them.
[208:20.12]Never told you.
[208:20.56]1900 to go.
[208:21.04]The enemy has.
[208:38.75]I'll let Trebuchet or whatever is coming in.
[208:41.49]They might be doing fire.
[208:43.73]Are they?
[208:44.49]I doubt it.
[208:45.13]They would need all five to do that.
[208:47.25]They're on this side though.
[208:51.81]I can go left side.
[208:52.65]If you run to me, I can help.
[208:58.69]I cannot use my abilities.
[209:01.25]We can still fight them right side, can't we?
[209:02.73]If I'm there.
[209:03.25]Why can't I press G?
[209:04.99]Sure, 4.
[209:06.40]Well, they're gone already.
[209:09.00]I thought they might push.
[209:11.06]Two mid, though.
[209:11.98]I spam G. It didn't work.
[209:13.53]Coming mid.
[209:16.75]His ulti knocks him up.
[209:18.79]Fuck, man.
[209:19.57]There's three there.
[209:21.11]I was baron there, too.
[209:22.39]Yeah, I didn't even know.
[209:24.13]There were three.
[209:25.29]Watch out mid.
[209:26.46]Don't push.
[209:26.82]There's a guy coming from right side.
[209:28.48]Yep.
[209:38.31]I want to go up.
[209:40.33]Okay.
[209:40.57]I'm just going to push mid.
[209:42.83]If I can get there.
[209:43.69]Damn, they're just doing objectives too.
[209:45.53]What the fuck?
[209:46.41]Yeah.
[209:46.59]Yeah, because they're getting kills.
[209:54.94]Oh, behind you.
[209:55.64]Oh, fuck me.
[209:56.84]Can you survive?
[209:57.26]Can you survive?
[209:58.12]No.
[209:59.48]Nah, I should have magic shelled.
[210:01.48]Fuck, why did I ult?
[210:02.70]Damn it, there's three right side.
[210:13.39]Maybe we should start moving as a team now.
[210:16.75]Yeah, they're kind of past us on gold pretty hard.
[210:23.45]All we can really do is push lanes.
[210:27.43]Is this Kali by herself?
[210:28.37]We can probably get this Kali.
[210:31.95]She gone.
[210:34.22]But is she completely gone?
[210:35.78]Let's find out.
[210:38.26]Yeah, she's up here somewhere.
[210:55.51]I don't have to complete my build.
[211:02.41]Nobody here in middle, huh?
[211:06.05]On the right side.
[211:09.23]Baron's on the left side.
[211:11.17]There's two mid.
[211:19.44]You guys want to try doing something on the right side?
[211:22.24]Yeah, I'm down.
[211:23.28]They're just playing passive by the looks of it.
[211:26.53]Yeah, we just need more wards.
[211:29.53]Oh, shit.
[211:32.15]I can come to Colin.
[211:35.19]I'm warding like a very... Oh, I know.
[211:36.75]I warded right here.
[211:38.11]She stunned me, but she ran back.
[211:40.62]Take this.
[211:42.86]We can take right tower.
[211:44.68]Yeah, their ADC is mid.
[211:46.18]We can take right.
[211:46.84]We can take right.
[211:48.26]I'm coming mid right now.
[211:49.18]I see we go mid.
[211:49.64]I'll push right.
[211:50.68]I'll push right alone.
[211:51.76]Okay.
[211:59.61]I'm behind you, Baka.
[212:00.57]She's literally one shot.
[212:02.31]She's literally one shot.
[212:03.67]Kali's a one shot.
[212:04.55]Just get out.
[212:05.33]All five are here.
[212:07.83]Trying.
[212:09.39]Yeah, I'm out.
[212:12.67]Let's get out.
[212:25.96]Fuck.
[212:28.50]Oh, they all went right for me.
[212:30.60]Oh, what the fuck?
[212:35.49]Alright.
[212:36.59]Well, that was scary.
[212:37.65]He just tanked the turret like that?
[212:42.25]They just... They got tanked like that?
[212:45.29]What is that?
[212:46.27]He was tanking the... It was a turtle.
[212:47.43]He was just tanking the fucking turret.
[212:48.83]Are they all up there still?
[212:49.60]Yeah, they were still here.
[212:54.12]But careful.
[212:54.86]Okay, they're going back there.
[213:00.96]Baron's right here.
[213:04.72]Rammus 2.0.
[213:05.22]I can take this.
[213:09.00]You took my buff.
[213:10.20]What?
[213:11.64]Can I drop it?
[213:12.84]No.
[213:13.06]It's like red buff.
[213:15.34]What's the problem, man?
[213:16.08]I need to reuse the buff.
[213:19.38]Sorry.
[213:19.50]It's alright.
[213:21.92]I'll do a lot with it.
[213:22.57]I promise.
[213:22.93]Don't believe me.
[213:25.83]Alright, what's left side?
[213:26.63]Is there anything left side that's up right now?
[213:29.79]We could try to do... The Pyro's up in a minute.
[213:34.05]We need to ward it.
[213:34.57]We need to ward it.
[213:35.53]Yeah, I got a ward.
[213:36.83]They're going mid.
[213:37.37]We should do something mid.
[213:40.95]They're doing one of the camps in the middle.
[213:42.45]They're getting ready for Pyro.
[213:43.61]Careful.
[213:46.01]I'm trying to get as much XP as I can right now.
[213:47.83]Can we kill this?
[213:50.44]Your middle tower is under attack.
[213:55.21]They're definitely setting up for Pyro for sure.
[213:57.45]I don't have ward right now though.
[213:59.89]I got a ward up there.
[214:01.65]There's a ward up there.
[214:05.21]I'll clear left.
[214:08.97]I'm ulting.
[214:09.43]I'm ulting.
[214:09.77]I'm pulling this guy.
[214:13.62]We need that.
[214:14.08]We need that.
[214:14.52]We need that.
[214:17.18]His ult makes it so he can't die.
[214:21.92]He has Tryndamere ult in that ult.
[214:25.13]So if we don't have a stun or something, they can just run.
[214:27.21]Yeah, they're all hanging out here now.
[214:30.89]There's ult for ult.
[214:33.58]I think they want to do Pyro.
[214:38.48]Watch out Baron, Baron, Baron.
[214:39.72]Baron's right here.
[214:41.36]Coming.
[214:42.46]They're coming in.
[214:44.70]Oh, fuck.
[214:46.30]I have 22 seconds until my ult.
[214:51.53]I'm here.
[214:52.69]I'm here.
[214:52.99]I could be done.
[214:54.67]I got fucking destroyed.
[214:55.85]God damn it I got picked by the turtle I couldn't move and I got melted.
[215:08.84]I Don't even know what happened wrong button
[215:17.36]They were getting noob stomped by a Kali right now.
[215:19.52]They played for two weeks and the team was announced like, what, a week ago?
[215:23.76]Cheaters.
[215:24.46]Confirmed.
[215:27.12]What do I want to buy?
[215:29.68]Fuck me.
[215:33.84]I mean, it ain't over.
[215:36.68]I mean, we're down.
[215:37.82]We're behind like this before.
[215:39.34]We did come back.
[215:41.70]We have.
[215:42.86]We still want to get money.
[215:44.40]They're all level 20 and we're not even close.
[215:59.47]What we need to do is win one team fight.
[216:02.03]Yeah.
[216:02.55]That's all that matters.
[216:03.09]Yeah, farm for like an hour.
[216:03.77]Farm for an hour and we're good.
[216:05.45]Just farm for an hour.
[216:06.05]We can just stay under towers.
[216:07.41]We can just stay under towers.
[216:10.39]Yeah, the Fire Giant really was a big negative.
[216:16.69]We lost our momentum after the Fire Giant.
[216:23.41]Imagine if we got it.
[216:24.38]Farm for an hour.
[216:25.40]What is this thing doing?
[216:36.46]I didn't buy wards.
[216:39.37]They're in mid right now.
[216:41.50]Three in mid.
[216:44.86]Mid?
[216:45.54]Yeah, they're three in mid right now.
[216:47.18]I'm pushing mid.
[216:48.38]Four in mid right now.
[216:49.56]They're at the tower right now.
[216:50.64]Coming mid.
[216:51.08]Coming mid.
[216:52.68]There's four.
[216:53.72]They're all here.
[216:55.58]Every single person's here.
[216:56.50]They destroyed the tower?
[216:58.68]They're coming in.
[216:59.09]They're coming into the jungle.
[216:59.93]Coming to the jungle.
[217:01.73]I'm here.
[217:02.01]I'm here.
[217:02.45]I'm pulling them from the jungle.
[217:04.87]One on me.
[217:06.01]Fuck it.
[217:06.23]I'm taking them.
[217:09.37]I'm died.
[217:12.62]Holy fuck.
[217:13.70]Cali can't die in her ult.
[217:18.34]Holy shit, what's going on?
[217:19.64]GG's.
[217:21.62]It's not over yet.
[217:23.80]It's not over, it's not over.
[217:25.04]I know, I'm just saying things.
[217:37.34]I got a heal.
[217:38.96]Same.
[217:46.62]I'm so close.
[217:54.54]Once we get even in gold and XP, we have a better team fight than them.
[218:02.04]Yeah, they're mid.
[218:03.30]I'm just going to wait for my item then because what else am I going to do at this point?
[218:10.52]I need eight gold.
[218:13.04]Collapse, Kevin.
[218:14.40]Is that what somebody just said?
[218:16.06]We just sit under tower and fucking... We just have to kite them or wait for big Ares ults.
[218:27.71]Because if we force too much, the Kali is just going to press R and not die.
[218:32.86]Yeah, makes sense.
[218:36.29]Russell, you're going to make the game when you play, Russell.
[218:39.23]I am going to try my best.
[218:41.45]I tried to eat that guy, but it didn't work.
[218:44.97]I'm trying to catch up in levels and XP.
[218:53.66]Alright.
[218:54.32]Let's group up somewhere.
[218:57.15]They're right here.
[218:58.03]I can't get this buff here.
[218:59.27]They're alright here.
[219:00.11]I can't get it.
[219:00.65]Oh, fuck.
[219:05.83]I'm like trying to run.
[219:07.01]Holy shit.
[219:07.55]That fucking hurts.
[219:08.43]I'm out.
[219:09.30]I think we should be trying to run.
[219:13.96]I... Go, go, go, go, go.
[219:15.18]I can't, I can't.
[219:16.00]I'm getting fucking... I'm low as hell.
[219:17.64]Yeah, this is... Baron.
[219:19.30]If we die here, it's over.
[219:20.20]I am dead.
[219:21.34]Don't die, don't die, don't die.
[219:22.76]Just live.
[219:23.46]Oh, I went too.
[219:23.98]I thought your guys were behind me.
[219:25.22]If we die here, it's over.
[219:26.22]If your team might be there, it's over.
[219:27.60]I'm thinking fire, man.
[219:29.92]That's true.
[219:31.42]They're probably going to fire.
[219:32.14]I mean, I can wave clear.
[219:41.98]They're in mid right now three in mid I have good wave clear so they can't push too much.
[219:58.92]It's gonna be hard for them to get into the Phoenix.
[220:00.62]Yeah They're all going left though.
[220:02.98]They're probably gonna get that left tower
[220:11.15]I'm up in four.
[220:11.79]I'm with you, Surefour.
[220:15.15]Yeah, they're on left.
[220:21.09]What the fuck?
[220:22.07]They got that siege tower too.
[220:23.39]Okay, they all use their fucking thing.
[220:31.04]Anybody low?
[220:31.96]Are they low?
[220:32.38]Use beads.
[220:33.60]No.
[220:35.48]I could jump on top right now and just say fuck it, whatever.
[220:37.38]I'm gonna hit the trebuchet.
[220:43.22]My ult's up in 42 seconds.
[220:45.36]Two of them used their beads.
[220:48.76]Don't push up too hard because I don't know where they are.
[220:50.36]I don't have beads.
[220:53.51]Alright, I got full stack here.
[220:55.95]Since a lot of them don't have beads anymore, that'll be good for the next fight.
[221:01.21]Oh, I didn't want that.
[221:02.75]They're not doing fire turn or anything.
[221:05.07]They're doing it!
[221:05.92]Go, go, go!
[221:06.30]This is where we do it!
[221:07.32]Oh, that's bad!
[221:10.44]Don't die now.
[221:11.42]Back up, back up.
[221:13.62]I can't move.
[221:14.28]11 seconds.
[221:15.46]Wait, let's kill this.
[221:16.08]They're not here.
[221:16.52]They're not pushing.
[221:17.38]Let's kill this.
[221:18.38]We just wait this out then?
[221:19.76]That was the chance.
[221:20.40]I think we should have went in.
[221:21.50]I actually caught some.
[221:22.67]They're also low.
[221:24.01]I wasn't there.
[221:24.53]I wasn't there either.
[221:26.37]We were all just barely out in that position.
[221:28.31]That's true.
[221:32.09]We may have gotten in.
[221:35.79]It's possible we would have gotten in and killed somebody, but if they killed Divire Giant, we're all dead.
[221:40.78]They would have won.
[221:43.56]Yeah.
[221:45.56]So we just have to play slow again.
[221:48.24]They're all up here.
[221:50.64]At least one of them is.
[221:51.28]I'm going to go buy real quick.
[221:53.81]Might as well.
[221:54.69]Yeah, go finish your builds if you have.
[221:55.89]I think everybody just go buy wards as well.
[221:58.57]Finish your builds if you have any.
[222:02.62]We need to ward our jungle really bad.
[222:07.65]You're dead.
[222:09.67]Oh my god, I am.
[222:11.45]Yeah.
[222:12.63]We have to play by the tier 3s.
[222:14.51]Sorry.
[222:15.19]Oh my god.
[222:16.37]Yeah.
[222:22.32]I mean, at least my death isn't that bad.
[222:24.26]No, it is pretty bad.
[222:25.60]Is it?
[222:26.30]Yeah, because they're on initiator.
[222:27.92]Yeah, okay.
[222:33.14]I think they're, I think they're gonna go for it here.
[222:35.52]Oh yeah they are.
[222:37.27]Yep, I'm dead.
[222:39.85]They're just fucking aping me.
[222:42.13]Yeah.
[222:43.11]Sorry guys.
[222:44.65]GG.
[222:48.25]Nope.
[222:49.01]Standard tower, standard tower.
[222:58.18]Yeah, Kali's invincible with the owner ult.
[223:02.15]Yep.
[223:02.67]She's a noob stomper.
[223:03.83]Christ, man.
[223:04.73]She's fucking 12 and 3.
[223:07.49]Yep.
[223:10.55]NT, boys.
[223:11.87]They were hacking.
[223:14.25]That was so hard.
[223:15.89]Yeah.
[223:16.81]I don't feel like I'm doing enough.
[223:19.99]I definitely was not.
[223:21.45]Dude, I'm telling you, the odds are stacked against us because it's OTK tournament and they want Tectone to win.
[223:27.01]GG.
[223:28.37]They had four straight pros and Tectone.
[223:32.03]What the heck?
[223:35.41]I'm kidding.
[223:36.01]Maybe we get more magic damage.
[223:37.47]Don't we get more magic damage?
[223:39.50]That wouldn't have changed anything.
[223:40.90]I'm magic.
[223:41.60]They even hired the fire dragon to get us too.
[223:43.74]I was just dead half the time.
[223:45.90]The Fire Giant.
[223:51.47]Wow.
[223:55.15]Well, GG, guys.
[223:58.05]I guess it was a good try, wasn't it?
[224:00.21]Wait, we're done?
[224:01.11]Yeah, we're out.
[224:03.84]Where's our coach?
[224:06.14]He's giving up on us.
[224:07.00]He doesn't even want to hear from us.
[224:09.02]We're done?
[224:10.06]I think there's a chance we might tie, by the way.
[224:12.92]Oh, tiebreaker?
[224:14.00]Yeah, if the other team wins.
[224:15.64]We might have another chance.
[224:16.62]Do we have another chance for the $100 million?
[224:20.47]I think the tiebreaker is like the win speed though.
[224:22.75]Like whoever won the fastest out of all three of you guys.
[224:24.81]So I don't know who that is.
[224:27.97]We got noob stomped by Akali.
[224:29.51]I forgot her ult makes her unkillable.
[224:31.73]Well, you guys like were actually fragging until you all died to the Fire Giant.
[224:35.98]That was the turning point.
[224:37.24]That was like if we... I think we probably would have won the game if we didn't die there.
[224:41.92]If you had done the fire before like a couple times, you guys wouldn't have died to it.
[224:45.50]It was just because you guys didn't know.
[224:47.90]would have been a nuts call like you would have just won the game that early too would have been crazy well what happened was they started without me and then they also ran away yeah yeah I didn't run away I think too I I was in I died first I I was in there with 40 health and just died I tried to jump away with like 10 elephant just got instantly killed that's alright if we win the tiebreaker we're still freaking going strong
[225:13.04]Can I pick something that hits harder?
[225:16.48]Maybe more CC?
[225:18.72]Yeah, we can give you something else if there's another game.
[225:22.27]Oh yeah, true.
[225:22.81]If there's another game.
[225:25.73]That Baron dude was nuts.
[225:27.43]He was just bragging me out.
[225:29.11]Just sucking me in and pulling everybody in.
[225:31.45]He was kind of tanky too.
[225:33.35]Yeah.
[225:36.87]Dude, that Kali was just running through us.
[225:43.96]Yeah, you forget that.
[225:46.14]It's like, oh my god, I'm gonna kill the Kali.
[225:48.25]No!
[225:49.09]She's invincible for like 10 seconds.
[225:51.19]Yeah.
[225:52.87]And even your brain is still just like, why?
[225:55.37]Why won't she die?
[225:56.89]I'm hurting her.
[226:04.07]They hacked.
[226:07.31]Aim hacking.
[226:09.90]They were aim locking and wall hacking.
[226:21.39]Yeah.
[226:21.55]So what's the, uh, what's the, what's the, what's the story now?
[226:25.47]We'll be waiting for the game teams are playing for the championship, like the teams with the best records.
[226:30.02]And then I don't know who's playing for second or who's playing for third.
[226:35.22]They're talking about it.
[226:36.56]I think we just have to wait and see gamers.
[226:54.96]Well, it's fun, at least.
[226:58.10]Yeah, it's fun.
[227:00.24]We got to see you naked.
[227:01.14]Yeah, that's true.
[227:02.60]Yeah, that's a good time.
[227:08.24]Just blame Russell and move on.
[227:12.92]That was definitely my ADC's fault.
[227:18.52]ADC's are just so weak.
[227:19.92]I did throw.
[227:20.68]I'm sorry.
[227:22.08]ADCs are weak, bro.
[227:23.40]You know how it works.
[227:24.54]Sorry, Russell.
[227:27.30]We just injected steroids and just screamed and we were just going crazy and then just ran straight as fast as we could into a brick wall.
[227:37.57]It was the Fire Giant.
[227:38.41]It was just like, I can fucking do anything!
[227:42.07]The hype behind fucking Poke's voice, too.
[227:44.64]He was like, Fire Giant!
[227:45.30]Fire Giant!
[227:45.76]We're like, yeah!
[227:46.86]I thought we could have done it.
[227:47.86]I think we can.
[227:49.92]We could have done it, but we did it bad.
[227:52.28]No, we could have.
[227:53.60]I just remember screaming Fire Giant like we were just doing a fucking ritual and then we just died.
[227:58.98]I mean, I feel like we all had so much health for a second and then it just went away.
[228:03.11]Fire Giant hurts.
[228:04.49]Yeah.
[228:09.31]Hey, I think we did pretty good for a bunch of people.
[228:11.49]Hey, how many of you, we haven't played the game in like six or seven years.
[228:16.87]Eight years.
[228:17.79]Noko, you downloaded the game two hours ago.
[228:20.99]Yeah.
[228:22.19]I think we did pretty good.
[228:23.25]I don't think I did that bad.
[228:24.63]No, you didn't.
[228:25.67]Yeah, we all did great.
[228:27.37]I think I even outlaned like a professional League of Legends pro.
[228:31.20]I think we did really good.
[228:33.34]And I think we could probably get like third or fourth place.
[228:37.30]I mean, Russell didn't show up yesterday.
[228:43.34]Russell.
[228:48.78]Come on.
[228:49.00]I didn't do bad.
[228:50.26]That's copium.
[228:50.90]Hey, we're allowed to have copium.
[228:52.58]We just group B is, wait, both groups have three O's and then one twos across the board.
[228:58.72]So wait, are we going to be third place?
[229:00.66]I don't know.
[229:01.54]Do we get money?
[229:02.88]We might be second.
[229:04.80]We grow.
[229:05.28]We grow.
[229:05.84]We get money.
[229:08.13]Wait, no, but that's not the bracket, is it?
[229:09.77]Are we playing to get in the bracket?
[229:11.04]I don't get it.
[229:11.62]I honestly don't understand how this is working.
[229:13.34]I literally asked and he said whoever loses in the semis.
[229:15.92]I don't know what the fuck that means.
[229:17.90]So we get third.
[229:19.34]So wait, how long from now is that?
[229:22.06]I don't even know if we can play.
[229:23.18]I have no idea.
[229:24.53]Wait, do only the top teams from the group play now?
[229:30.23]They play for the finals.
[229:31.37]You're playing the final championship game already, but there's, I guess, losers like third place?
[229:40.05]Oh, I see.
[229:40.77]There's... Okay.
[229:42.63]70 years.
[229:43.42]There's 303012121212121212.
[229:43.70]Wow.
[229:44.70]Oh, alright.
[229:46.06]That's going to be a shit show to figure out.
[229:52.42]That's going to be an absolute shit show.
[229:58.52]Oh, yeah.
[230:02.02]Wait.
[230:04.56]Dude, I'm hungry.
[230:07.82]I need food.
[230:09.08]I just need to know if we play more or not.
[230:11.06]Yeah, same.
[230:11.66]Because if not, I'm going to Apex.
[230:20.50]I thought you were trolling, by the way.
[230:21.90]1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.
[230:22.48]I was like, is that troll?
[230:24.85]Nope.
[230:25.25]It is real.
[230:26.75]Those are the numbers.
[230:29.83]There's six teams with 1, 2, and there's two teams with 3, 0.
[230:32.91]Huh.
[230:33.71]Oh, two teams with 3, 0.
[230:34.87]OK.
[230:35.17]Yeah, two teams 3, 0.
[230:36.31]Can we just all share a third place?
[230:38.11]That would be fine, right?
[230:39.21]Yeah.
[230:39.97]Wait, that's actually such a good idea.
[230:41.65]Why doesn't OTK just give us all money?
[230:44.71]Hey, everybody else lost, but you did a good job.
[230:47.79]Isn't that basically what Twitch Rivals is?
[230:50.09]Yeah.
[230:52.01]I think the only good thing about this right now is that it's about the rain.
[230:56.85]It's about the what?
[230:57.59]The rain?
[230:58.49]It's about to rain.
[230:59.19]I don't know.
[231:03.71]I love the rain.
[231:08.66]Oh, can I leave?
[231:09.72]We don't know.
[231:13.16]We really don't know yet.
[231:14.66]Can I leave?
[231:15.36]TJ is holding me hostage.
[231:18.58]We should get paid for being held hostage.
[231:20.72]Honestly, true.
[231:23.24]I have so much to do, guys.
[231:25.75]I'm very hungry.
[231:26.41]What do you have to do?
[231:27.25]You frigging busy man or something?
[231:28.59]I mean, I guess we could, I guess we could just like host the main stream and just go.
[231:34.63]You're going to end streaming.
[231:35.87]I was honestly just trolling.
[231:37.00]I have nothing to do.
[231:37.96]Well, actually, yeah, I do.
[231:38.98]I do have something, but not like.
[231:56.85]pay us pay us now oh because they bet I see they bet on our team winning the whole thing oh did they actually well well he's talking about his yeah channel points yeah oh I was like damn they really believed in us like that I was like damn I feel like I let everybody down uh there is definitely not a chance to win the tournament so I think that is official right
[232:23.95]Yeah, definitely.
[232:25.48]No!
[232:26.46]My fight money!
[232:27.28]Honestly, I'm just really happy that I knew what buff camps were what.
[232:39.53]I'm proud of you.
[232:40.59]I think that was the best one.
[232:42.55]That was intense.
[232:43.19]That was fun.
[232:43.69]Did you get you riled up?
[232:47.67]I did.
[232:47.99]I think you guys are done.
[232:49.39]Yeah, we didn't make it.
[232:50.35]No.
[232:52.51]What place did we end up?
[232:55.01]Thank God.
[232:56.03]Oh, man.
[232:56.39]We're not in last place.
[232:57.41]Are we?
[232:57.87]Everyone's last.
[233:03.19]Oh.
[233:03.31]OK.
[233:03.39]How did they even decide who got thrown out?
[233:05.07]I think we're all last place for playing Smite.
[233:07.63]I think it was fastest win from our bracket and fastest win from the other bracket.
[233:10.89]I just did our free sponsor.
[233:12.55]Oh.
[233:14.93]Our fight money.
[233:15.93]I had a reverse sponsor.
[233:19.58]GG, guys.
[233:20.52]I mean, all that matters is that we tried our best, right?
[233:22.52]I was naked on camera today.
[233:25.55]Well, you weren't on camera.
[233:27.37]Someone took a picture of you.
[233:30.13]I was literally naked.
[233:32.77]You keep saying you were wearing shorts.
[233:34.47]Are you lying now?
[233:35.47]Yes.
[233:37.24]What the?
[233:38.32]Wait, but which one is he lying about?
[233:39.44]I had fun, guys.
[233:40.30]GG's.
[233:41.14]Yeah, take it easy, man.
[233:43.20]Thanks for playing.
[233:44.02]GG's, everyone.
[233:45.14]Woohoo!
[233:46.12]I shall see you guys later.
[233:47.16]Bye-bye.
[233:47.82]Yep.
[233:48.08]Take it easy.
[233:49.10]Thanks.
[233:49.46]Uh, thanks weekend for trying to help.
[233:51.95]He's already gone, man.
[233:53.19]He's already gone.
[233:54.75]He's like, I could have made money on some other.
[233:57.71]He's like, I could have made 12 K bro.
[234:00.29]You give me that.
[234:00.87]You give me a bunch of fucking chumps.
[234:02.99]Yeah.
[234:04.64]That's funny.
[234:05.16]Not like with the losers.
[234:08.12]Alright.
[234:09.00]Did you guys.
[234:09.52]Yeah.
[234:09.68]See you later guys.
[234:10.16]Thanks for playing.
[234:13.45]Alright, guys.
[234:14.83]That was the tournament.
[234:16.99]I think we played pretty well.
[234:18.65]The Fire Giant shit, I think we were just high.
[234:21.25]You know, on our own supply.
[234:25.29]I think for, like I said before, a couple people that hadn't really played the game before.
[234:31.07]And then the rest of the team hadn't really played that much for years.
[234:34.62]I think we did pretty well.
[234:35.32]I think that was a good showing.
[234:37.42]We could have played a lot better, obviously, right?
[234:39.00]But whatever.
[234:39.74]Just for fun.
[234:43.47]It was fun.
[234:44.01]Yeah.
[234:52.09]Hopefully it was fun to watch.
[234:53.24]Yeah, sorry I wasn't really interacting with the chat at all.
[234:55.58]I'm trying to at least be somewhat involved in the callouts and stuff.
[235:05.00]But yeah, I think that's it.
[235:06.32]That's pretty much all I had planned.
[235:08.40]I want to...
[235:11.12]I want to just make sure I reiterate the next stream is going to be uh the green screen stream, which would be the 30th.
[235:16.12]I have hundreds of actions I'm going to do in front of the green screen.
[235:21.12]Should be a fun time it always is.
[235:24.12]So, see ya in front- see at the green screen stream.
[235:28.12]I don't really have a start time but it's going to be somewhere in the afternoon - pacific.
[235:32.12]But I want to make sure that I'm ready to go so I don't really have like a hard starting time just- I'll let you know at some point in the afternoon.
[235:45.80]June 30th.
[235:48.60]Congratulations or good luck to whoever is going to win this tournament.
[235:51.54]Because, I mean, it's 100k.
[235:52.12]That's a lot of money.
[235:55.08]So, good luck.
[235:57.40]Then, yeah.
[235:58.38]I'm not going to do any really outro or anything.
[236:00.10]I just was kind of streaming so there's another perspective.
[236:06.04]Good night.
[236:07.56]Goodbye.
[236:08.08]I'll probably just... We'll just raid Mizgif.
[236:10.69]I mean, obviously, right?
[236:11.51]That makes sense.
[236:12.79]Let's raid Miskip so you can see the end of the tournament if you want.
[236:15.48]Good night.
[236:15.94]Goodbye.
[236:16.82]Much love to you.
[236:17.66]And I'll see you soon.
[236:20.12]Thanks for watching, guys.
[236:23.11]See you soon.
