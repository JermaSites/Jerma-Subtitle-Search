[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.74]How you doing?
[00:03.08]How are you doing?
[00:04.00]How are you?
[00:06.72]Good to see you again.
[00:09.44]You know who I am.
[00:10.26]Welcome back to the channel.
[00:11.20]My name is Jerma985, and we've got quite a day for you today.
[00:16.52]Tonight.
[00:18.18]Got a few things to talk about.
[00:19.52]We'll go over them one by one really quickly.
[00:22.08]Already got a +2, which means this is funny to somebody.
[00:25.24]What's up?
[00:32.51]So we had to change some plans today.
[00:35.79]Because I originally was going to play GTA Online.
[00:39.55]But I was told.
[00:40.75]I did some research.
[00:42.66]And I was shown a few things.
[00:43.86]But that's just kind of impossible.
[00:48.08]Uh, it's, uh, isn't it apparently one of the easiest things in the world to just, like, get into a GTA Online lobby and just, like, break it?
[00:57.68]So, I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that unless there's a different solution on maybe a private server or something.
[01:04.57]I don't know.
[01:06.47]Uh, it's apparently very easy to get into games that people are in.
[01:10.41]There's a lot of, like, IP problems, I think.
[01:13.93]And even just getting into the server itself, people can just kind of get in and, you know.
[01:18.62]And, and, and hack!
[01:19.64]I don't know.
[01:20.12]I don't know anything about it.
[01:20.94]It's just, it's apparently hard to do.
[01:25.96]It's a scary hacker word.
[01:27.99]Hacker.
[01:28.55]I don't know.
[01:31.71]So, instead of that...
[01:35.42]You're a liar.
[01:37.11]What?
[01:37.39]This is documented evidence.
[01:40.83]What are you talking about?
[01:41.81]I'm a liar.
[01:43.59]You liar.
[01:50.61]If two cars crash into each other, and you ask me, what happened?
[01:56.54]And I say, oh, that was a car accident.
[01:59.04]Liar.
[02:00.84]What?
[02:01.20]It's two cars.
[02:02.34]That's just factual information sitting in front of you.
[02:06.36]You're a liar.
[02:07.68]No, I'm just processing the information.
[02:13.86]Anyways.
[02:15.27]Stop.
[02:15.55]If I get another question mark, I'm ending the stream.
[02:19.05]It's over if I get another question mark.
[02:23.03]Just how I was looking over there and seeing that, how upset that makes me.
[02:28.90]Question mark, question mark, question mark.
[02:30.80]I know what I'm talking about.
[02:32.26]I'm an adult.
[02:33.74]I'm 36 years old.
[02:35.88]I know what I'm talking about.
[02:36.94]I don't want to see that anymore.
[02:41.54]I don't like those question marks.
[02:43.55]They make me unhappy.
[02:46.89]out of the gym this sounds fake it's all fake everything is fake here except for five percent of the time when it's not alright no more stalling let's go uh so instead of that I'm not gonna do GTA Online it's not gonna happen I'll have to figure out something else to do with GTA if I ever do it uh I've been asked to do the last few months now the last at least couple months
[03:09.63]a couple of Jerma universe fan games have shown themselves on Steam and apparently a couple of them are very much elaborately well made so I was like why not why don't we check these out so we're gonna do the uh the fan games

[06:36.59]That's how you know this is a real deal.
[06:37.91]Is there a jump?
[06:39.37]There is a jump.
[06:42.33]Tell another joke?
[06:43.27]This is so accurate.
[06:50.52]Do not enter.
[06:51.18]Should I go in there?
[06:51.96]Look how sweaty I was.
[06:53.12]Hold.
[06:55.44]Alright, hold.
[07:03.72]He has three jokes.

[07:21.80]Turn back.
[07:22.46]Uh-oh.

[07:36.02]Jump in it?
[07:37.77]Fall joke.
[07:40.43]Hold on.
[07:40.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:48.53]I'm probably like 150,000 feet.
[07:56.40]Jeremy goes to Undertale.
[08:02.12]You see my underwear?
[08:02.94]What is that?
[08:06.40]What is that on my stomach?
[08:19.21]Okay.
[08:19.94]Apparently I was streaming outside.
[08:21.32]Jesus.
[08:33.07]I got an achievement.
[08:33.97]The achievement was actually called Fall Joke.
[08:36.45]Somebody liked it.
[08:37.03]Good.
[08:37.33]Alright.
[08:40.45]It's your thong.
[08:42.03]Joke charge meter.

[09:05.79]I gotta go.
[09:09.79]Is this what I'm like?
[09:13.22]Oh, this is a new movement.
[09:19.72]This is actually hold to jump higher.
[09:22.18]Is this like a Metroidvania?
[09:27.62]Should I tell more jokes?
[09:28.94]No, I can't.
[09:34.17]I'm doing the I'm falling thing every time I jump Loot get got it.
[09:45.53]I'm assuming this is my attack.
[09:48.61]How do I attack?
[09:52.01]Press right trigger to swing or right bumper This is crazy
[10:03.78]Hold to heal.
[10:04.78]Okay, so let's keep going.
[10:11.55]Are there enemies in the game?
[10:12.63]Do I have to fight actual enemies?
[10:14.09]Why am I running like this?
[10:24.90]I'm running like an absolute shithead.
[10:26.96]Face wall while falling to grab edge.
[10:34.80]I promise I don't actually run like this in real life.
[10:36.80]I can run actually pretty fast and well.
[10:39.88]Press and hold jump to boost jump off an edge.
[10:45.52]That's copium.
[10:46.74]No, I'm serious.
[10:47.46]I don't run like this.
[10:48.32]I think you guys have seen me run.
[10:50.10]I don't run with my neck out like that.
[10:52.78]That was definitely for a joke.
[10:54.20]Alright, duck.
[10:55.78]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[11:03.38]That's pretty cool.
[11:06.50]Checkpoint reached.
[11:09.78]Are they bosses?
[11:11.00]Robot dinos.
[11:12.22]Danger.
[11:12.62]Hold on.
[11:14.67]I have an ad for Fortnite on my screen right now, and I don't even have... The Jerva Raptor.
[11:39.54]Okay.
[11:39.78]They have lasers?
[11:43.14]Reflect projectile?
[11:48.83]Alright, that... What?
[11:53.61]Everybody loves that one!
[11:56.57]What are you talking about?
[11:57.93]That's like everybody's favorite.
[12:01.72]They can be bad jokes and I don't get healed?
[12:05.76]Oh, shit.
[12:09.02]Oh my god, this is actually a video game now.
[12:11.28]Oh, that's how many hits it takes.
[12:20.97]There we go.
[12:21.51]Alright, good.
[12:22.43]I like that one.
[12:29.27]Marvelous.
[12:31.75]Ow.
[12:33.11]Okay, I got six squares?
[12:38.80]There's music too.
[12:41.47]Listen to this.
[12:42.71]You're already here watching.
[12:43.69]Why do I have to do that?
[12:45.05]I don't know why I do that.
[12:47.11]I am the annoying person.
[12:48.21]I'm sorry.
[12:48.95]Is it like a currency thing?
[12:50.01]I'm the annoying guy at the movie or in the game that says, Hey, look.
[12:55.15]Watch this part.
[12:56.39]I know.
[12:56.63]I'm fucking already doing it.
[12:58.31]Can you aim it?
[13:02.52]Can I aim it and angle it?
[13:04.24]I can.
[13:04.70]Alright.
[13:07.03]Use L and press... Okay, so I can aim the bat up or down.
[13:19.44]What?
[13:19.74]This is genuinely a good game.
[13:25.90]I mean, it kind of is.
[13:26.80]How many remaining?
[13:29.91]Oh, I have to kill them all.
[13:30.81]I see.
[13:38.73]Oh shit.
[13:39.55]Can I swing that way?
[13:44.21]I don't think I can swing to my left.
[13:45.17]Can I?
[13:46.63]I can't swing left.
[13:47.31]Oh shit.
[13:53.83]This is the best game to stream because the game streams for me.
[13:59.92]I don't even have to do anything.
[14:03.26]This is awesome.
[14:04.12]I don't even- I barely even have to say anything.
[14:15.88]Why didn't I do this before?
[14:16.94]Alright, here we go.
[14:21.56]This is definitely bosses, too.
[14:22.70]I can't wait.
[14:26.06]He's doing all the old hits.
[14:28.71]Alright, I gotta watch out.
[14:32.25]Up.
[14:35.43]So, that's funny.
[14:38.75]That's funny.
[14:39.43]I like that one.
[14:40.27]That's not -2.
[14:41.67]That's a good one.
[14:43.60]Oh, I can't do... It has to be charged up.
[14:46.16]I see.
[14:46.44]Alright, alright.
[14:46.92]I see.
[14:47.16]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[14:50.87]Pull him down here.
[14:56.99]There we go.
[14:59.09]Zonked.
[15:03.71]You need more Jerma juice for jokes?
[15:06.21]Oh, I see.
[15:07.37]Do I just get that for hitting boxes and stuff?
[15:09.76]The giant enemy spider.
[15:15.69]I love this.
[15:17.23]This is exactly what I'm looking for.
[15:18.71]Damn it.
[15:23.34]Dead end down?
[15:25.88]Okay, where?
[15:27.12]Exit.
[15:27.60]Wait, should I explore?
[15:28.38]Are there secrets?
[15:30.50]There's definitely secrets.
[15:31.26]Where am I kidding?
[15:31.71]Are you serious?
[15:36.83]Yep, there it is.
[15:44.07]There's gotta be Easter eggs.
[15:45.65]I gotta find all the Easter eggs.
[15:48.88]Did I miss a secret?
[15:57.50]Is it fall damage?
[15:58.40]No.
[16:00.77]It's not Easter.
[16:04.07]Get at it.
[16:06.45]Can I go up there?
[16:07.13]There's a little divot right there.
[16:14.12]Can I go up here?
[16:15.08]Oh, I can go up here.
[16:16.24]So what is this?
[16:22.52]Okay, there's caution symbols.
[16:29.55]What does that mean?
[16:32.65]Exit, exit, exit, exit.
[16:39.33]How do I get up there?
[16:42.40]How do I get up there?
[16:43.36]I'm telling you, this is Metroidvania.
[16:51.03]I can't make it from here.
[16:51.75]Holy shit.
[16:55.97]Okay, that works.
[16:58.22]You go so much further when you do a roll.
[17:02.74]Oh, fuck.
[17:03.24]Hold on.
[17:03.46]I'll get it.
[17:03.72]Is there a double jump?
[17:07.72]No, the roll jump works.
[17:14.88]That's a Donkey Kong strat.
[17:18.00]Oh, come on.
[17:18.38]Do I have to get out of the roll to grab the edge?
[17:24.26]Yeah, you have to get out of the roll to grab.
[17:25.42]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[17:25.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[17:26.36]There we go.
[17:30.54]You can't be rolling.
[17:36.58]Alright, what do I get?
[17:44.53]Alright, somebody liked that.
[17:45.55]Good.
[17:54.32]That was worth two funny points.
[18:00.45]Head to the exit.
[18:01.93]Alright, cool, cool.
[18:02.63]Now what?
[18:08.29]Uh, robot dinos again.
[18:18.31]Oh, I have to activate all these with lasers.
[18:20.35]Oh, shit.
[18:20.97]Okay.
[18:24.90]Can I flip it?
[18:25.38]No.
[18:30.58]I hit that one.
[18:31.94]Thank you.
[18:34.12]Oh, God.
[18:36.32]I did it.
[18:36.60]That's exactly what I had to do.
[18:37.80]Right here.
[18:38.18]Come here.
[18:47.06]Up here?
[18:50.49]Keep going, higher.
[18:53.47]You're gonna be up here.
[18:55.30]No!
[18:59.38]I'm not gonna kill the raptors and softlock myself.
[19:04.76]Fuck, I actually might have just ruined it.
[19:07.80]No, I got it.
[19:13.51]No.
[19:15.49]Get outta here!
[19:18.09]Shoot!
[19:21.88]Oh my god, he actually hit me.
[19:26.26]Any more there?
[19:26.74]Right here.
[19:39.91]There's only one more, right?
[19:42.61]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[19:52.72]Can you shoot up here?
[19:58.25]Wait, I can deflect it?
[19:59.51]Does it count?
[20:01.37]Oh, it does.
[20:01.99]Okay.
[20:07.57]I thought it turned to green.
[20:09.33]Do I need to kill them?
[20:10.68]I think I can just leave.
[20:11.36]I don't want to miss the EXP.
[20:13.78]Secret?
[20:13.92]Is there one here?
[20:31.64]Okay, that's not me saying yeah, right?
[20:33.86]That's somebody else.
[20:38.34]I think I can get up there.
[20:40.20]No, I can't.
[20:48.20]That's not me.
[20:49.80]Oh, there are warlocks now.
[20:53.05]You know what?
[20:53.59]I guarantee I know what it is.
[20:55.91]I guarantee.
[20:56.55]It's going to be when I had the Harry Potter stuff on.
[21:00.03]it's definitely Harry Potter yep it's gonna be the shock warlock excuse me you think you can do me
[21:35.64]How do I even react to this?
[21:40.32]This is so bizarre.
[21:43.50]It's so cool though.
[21:50.25]God, I would have loved to be like a warlock.
[21:52.61]You know what I mean?
[22:04.45]I know, he's high again.
[22:05.35]What do you mean, what?
[22:06.13]I don't know.
[22:09.33]If, like, magic was real, it'd be cool to be like a warlock.
[22:16.31]I don't want to be the guy with the axe that runs up to people.
[22:18.95]Everyone's like, oh man, I would be like a melee fo- No, what the hell is wrong with you?
[22:22.71]I mean, you can have, like, you can conjure demons and, like, stay at a distance and shoot shadow bolts at people?
[22:28.91]Why the fuck would you ever want to have an axe in your hand?
[22:34.52]That's horrible.
[22:45.30]Why can't you be both?
[22:48.26]You don't have skill points.
[22:49.14]Are you serious?
[22:55.94]Hold on.
[22:58.30]I'm gonna die here.
[22:59.20]I'm gonna die here.
[22:59.66]This is it.
[23:08.97]So what happens when you die?
[23:09.79]Go to menu?
[23:14.58]No.
[23:14.80]Restart from the checkpoint.
[23:23.33]Let's go.
[23:23.85]5,000 hours in Isaac, by the way.
[23:28.11]Yeah, over the course of 10 years.
[23:35.75]Okay, during the smite stream, we already went over this.
[23:39.01]If you are not actively playing a video game, it takes like weeks to get back into it and get back to where you were.
[23:48.19]It's like the gym.
[23:49.78]You can't just stop going to the gym.
[23:56.34]Yeah, I also used to be like 170 pounds of pure muscle, a stack of absolute shit, and I was unstoppable.
[24:03.71]I now, like, see my stomach when I take a piss now.
[24:07.53]That's just a fact.
[24:09.66]Just because I worked out before, I couldn't do it right now if I wanted to.
[24:36.47]Let's heal.
[24:36.79]How did you speed that up?
[24:38.35]That didn't need to be sped up.
[24:40.73]No, don't!
[25:04.95]Don't kill me.
[25:05.81]Come on.
[25:06.21]Don't kill me.
[25:07.01]Don't kill me.
[25:08.29]Me playing.
[25:09.33]You should give me extra lives.
[25:12.53]Holy shit.
[25:13.15]I'm gonna die.
[25:14.93]They're all shooting at the same time.
[25:26.67]God damn it.
[25:31.27]Alright, that's what you gotta do.
[25:41.00]Oh shit, too many.
[25:45.10]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't shoot me!
[25:47.40]Oh, fuck.
[25:47.86]Alright, this is hard.
[25:49.46]This is hard.
[25:53.75]Alright, this is a hard game.
[25:54.49]Let's go.
[25:55.51]I'll get it this time, I promise.
[26:05.01]You died to the Warlocks, Omegalull.
[26:06.83]No!
[26:07.61]This is not an easy game!
[26:16.92]Here we are.
[26:20.06]Don't ever melee the Warlocks.
[26:28.45]You attacked who?
[26:31.73]You attacked my friend who?
[26:37.77]You attacked my friend... Oh, Malfoy.
[26:39.55]Okay.
[26:40.90]God damn it.
[26:51.36]That's not +2.
[26:52.40]Everybody hates that.
[26:53.98]Everybody hates that.
[27:04.34]La-la.
[27:07.51]La-la-la.
[27:09.97]La-la.
[27:16.91]Damn it!
[27:25.20]See, look, everyone's saying -2.
[27:26.94]See, I told you.
[27:27.44]Oh my god, I'm so bad.
[27:36.94]Alright.
[27:39.34]This is where I was last time.
[27:50.17]I don't wanna get messed up again.
[27:51.97]Don't die here.
[28:00.40]This is probably gonna get so hard.
[28:03.92]I'm already having trouble in this room.
[28:11.55]Damn it!
[28:11.99]They said don't attack melee.
[28:13.17]I couldn't help it.
[28:17.39]I'm trying to aim down.
[28:18.09]Come on.
[28:18.45]He's left.
[28:30.38]This game is really well made.
[28:31.34]Yeah, it is.
[28:36.50]I took one look at this on the screenshots and I was just... This is elaborate.
[28:41.12]This is very elaborate.
[28:46.55]Fuck, don't die to the warlock here.
[28:47.83]Don't be an idiot.
[28:52.73]There he is.
[28:53.91]Alright, let's go.
[28:56.35]See you, Greg.
[29:00.91]Onion ring.
[29:01.23]I got an onion ring.
[29:07.14]What's up here?
[29:07.96]Oh, this looks dangerous.
[29:17.84]Damn it.
[29:18.74]Dude, that's not me laughing.
[29:22.18]There's no way that's me.
[29:38.67]It's supposed to be us.
[29:39.95]Oh right, I can see the audience.
[29:41.37]Alright, what's in the top?
[29:55.30]This is so high!
[29:56.38]Expelliarmus for every spell?
[30:20.07]Oh shit, this is another way to go.
[30:21.32]What?
[30:27.12]I think it's random.
[30:28.38]Otto!
[30:28.48]Nice.
[30:28.64]I can't believe it.
[30:32.32]I can't believe we just shot Otto.
[30:53.05]Alright, so we got auto, giant rat.
[30:58.71]How dare they -2?
[30:59.95]I think it's random.
[31:05.78]I think randomly you get a bad one.
[31:14.04]Very quiet now.
[31:18.55]I think this is a boss.
[31:23.68]Is there a checkpoint?
[31:32.83]Checkpoint?
[31:33.63]Is it like a currency thing?
[31:37.61]Casino?
[31:43.21]Well, I have to go in here.
[31:46.93]I would not be mad if I didn't.
[31:57.15]What is this?
[31:59.99]Times 10?
[32:00.37]Times two.
[32:03.05]3x, 4x, 5x, alright.
[32:04.67]But what am I betting?
[32:07.49]Inserted funnies.
[32:12.03]Oh, okay, let's do 64 funnies, let's go.
[32:23.05]That's triple watermelons.
[32:24.77]That's triple watermelons, I just got, what did I just get?
[32:28.17]Holy shit, it's 2x.
[32:29.15]Alright.
[32:32.39]You can't just... It has to be a max bet, otherwise I'm going to lose everything.
[32:37.26]Seven.
[32:40.52]Give me another one.
[32:42.68]Nice.
[32:43.32]Oh, that's good.
[32:44.24]Alright, now I'm at 500.
[32:45.33]Now I'm going to do a low bet.

[33:33.95]Alright, I got, look, I made money.
[33:47.36]It's a diamond.
[33:49.18]Three diamonds, let's see it.
[33:51.81]Goodbye, I win, I'm done.
[33:57.15]That's 5x.
[33:57.39]Alright, one more.
[33:59.51]1,000 and then we're done.
[34:05.69]That's it.
[34:06.07]I'm done after this.
[34:07.67]I'll take a fruit.
[34:10.43]Alright, I'm out of here.
[34:14.05]I'm out.
[34:14.23]I made over 1,000 funnies.
[34:15.25]I'm good.
[34:15.61]I'm done.
[34:15.89]Let's go.
[34:30.96]I came in here with like 300.
[34:32.46]I'm leaving with 1500.
[34:33.26]Oh, is that not a win?
[34:35.80]Doesn't matter what you went up.
[34:37.26]Doesn't matter if you don't go down.
[34:38.26]Uh-oh.
[34:57.58]A giant enemy dinosaur.
[35:05.39]What do I do?
[35:08.75]Reflect?
[35:12.66]Oh, shit.
[35:13.12]Alright.
[35:13.38]Can I go down?
[35:15.90]It's not like Bowser, right?
[35:40.47]Shield's down.
[35:41.91]Wait, it's just... Oh fuck, there's like multiple phases?
[35:50.20]Oh man, this is not as just self expla- Oh my god.
[35:53.42]Alright, hold on.
[35:54.20]I gotta stop talking.
[35:54.74]You know, don't say swear.
[36:06.00]Come on!
[36:16.64]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[36:20.88]The adds.
[36:27.15]Watch out.
[36:30.23]Does that hit them too?
[36:30.97]It does.
[36:31.19]Okay, good.
[36:44.76]Juggle.
[36:45.98]Just keep him juggled.
[36:55.43]Oh, this is bad.
[36:56.05]Okay, I gotta hide.
[37:01.63]Hold him one at a time.
[37:09.47]If I get hit like three or four times, I'm gonna die.
[37:21.16]Shit.
[37:21.46]Alright, we're fine.
[37:23.18]Fuck.
[37:24.88]One more and we're good.
[37:28.48]That is it.
[37:29.60]Boss dead.
[37:30.30]Nice.
[37:32.58]Did it explode?
[37:58.61]This is just what a regular stream is.
[38:00.01]I'm kind of realizing.
[38:01.51]Like, it's press X to fill dead air with various noises.
[38:08.73]Oh, shit, I haven't really said anything in, like, a few minutes.
[38:16.19]It's just ways to keep you engaged.
[38:20.16]Wait, don't break them all.
[38:29.01]It's probably a secret somewhere, right?
[38:30.45]Why would they put all these here?
[38:35.60]Yeah, I knew it.
[38:38.32]What's up here?
[38:41.04]Another rat.
[38:50.15]You need to jingle the keys.
[38:51.51]We're children.
[38:52.29]Hahaha.
[38:59.77]Reward.
[39:00.23]What's wrong with my guy?
[39:03.92]Truth.
[39:08.16]Truth.
[39:08.52]What's the truth?
[39:18.99]You've done very well, young one.
[39:24.91]You've proven your strength to me.
[39:30.79]Perhaps it's time.
[39:31.72]To reveal my true identity.
[39:49.31]It is I, your great times 18 great grandfather.
[39:54.23]I can teach you all the secrets, for you are the only person to ever make it through the dungeon.
[40:01.34]So your choice is this.
[40:03.32]Come with me, or take this at least two months' supply of chips.
[40:09.82]The choice is yours.
[40:11.69]I stand you will make the correct one.
[40:14.31]What do you want to know about your father?
[40:17.15]What about your gran?
[40:18.97]You're going down!
[40:19.95]Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[40:22.63]The secret is this.
[40:31.16]I didn't press anything.
[40:32.86]Happy birthday!
[40:39.56]Oh, thanks!
[40:40.74]The secret about your father and grandfather is that they are both here to celebrate, along with the birthday rats.
[40:48.27]Let's go to the party.
[40:53.95]Rats, rats, we are the rats.
[40:56.00]Celebrate another one of our birthday rats.
[40:57.96]Jeremy!
[41:02.03]I'm so sweaty in that middle one.
[41:11.87]Nice.
[41:13.81]Very nice.
[41:16.72]No, it's not.
[41:17.26]It's not.
[41:17.52]The stream's still live.
[41:18.64]It's not over.
[41:24.76]The stream is not over.
[41:31.99]1586.
[41:32.01]Final time, 27 minutes plus you played in the slots.
[41:37.76]It's now the best stream.
[41:43.44]All that gambling paid off.
[41:49.33]There was Big Adventure, a game by Warbler.
[41:54.42]Based on Jerma985, the shpee guy.
[41:56.86]Wait, truth ending two.
[42:05.66]Truth ending one.
[42:08.42]What does that mean?
[42:23.51]But with Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Audition.
[42:29.39]Oh, if I actually hit him.
[42:30.99]You could kill him for the chips.
[42:31.91]Ah, alright.
[42:37.71]Can we see the other ending?
[42:40.55]I want to see the other ending.
[42:48.19]That was so cool.
[42:50.59]Oh, look out for a wacky behind the scenes video!
[42:53.92]I wonder if that's there.
[42:54.56]Nice playing.
[43:01.62]I want to see the other ending.
[43:02.84]New game.
[43:08.52]Can I speed run it?
[43:13.91]Wait, wait a minute.
[43:14.85]Oh, nice.
[43:15.45]Okay, I'm going to start from the post-boss region.
[43:21.93]with no, with zero points.
[43:23.85]What a psycho mode.
[43:29.80]Alright, well, I want to see the other ending first.
[43:58.56]Okay.
[43:58.82]The other ending is to hit him and get the chips.
[44:01.04]Let's see what we get.
[44:05.42]I can skip the cutscene.
[44:08.64]Okay.
[44:13.62]Oh shit, no!
[44:14.60]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:15.60]I don't want to... Wait, what?
[44:22.93]Took no damage.
[44:28.60]I didn't mean... I didn't mean... Okay, hold on.
[44:30.30]This is a very sad ending.
[44:32.42]Alright, let me... Hold on, let me do that again.
[44:48.71]That was the ending.
[44:49.73]Was that... No, it wasn't.
[44:51.17]Okay, new game.
[44:54.22]Start from that checkpoint.
[44:56.56]I'm gonna hit him.
[44:59.07]Let's start with $300.
[45:00.50]Okay, go.
[45:07.41]There's more to it, I swear.
[45:08.85]Okay.
[45:09.07]That was from the dev's mouth.
[45:29.69]Okay.
[45:32.87]I'm ready.
[45:34.45]We're going to kill the grandfather and go get the chips.
[45:43.90]You've done well.
[45:52.99]Okay.
[45:54.71]We can fill the dead air.
[45:56.65]Beep, beep, beep.
[45:57.45]Beep, beep, beep.
[45:57.97]Beep, beep, beep.
[46:07.89]Oh, I jingled the keys.
[46:09.13]Oh, yes.
[46:11.45]It is I, your great times 18 great grandfather.
[46:16.42]I can teach you all the secrets for you are the only person to get through the dungeon.
[46:23.50]So your choice is this.
[46:25.50]Come with me or take this at least two months supply of chips.
[46:32.06]Ed.
[46:32.28]I kinda want the chips.
[47:08.58]Wait, this is a different outro.
[47:12.57]300 funnies.
[47:13.07]Okay.
[47:18.53]Final time.
[47:19.45]Plus jacks.
[47:21.61]Average stream.
[47:23.77]That's fine.
[47:24.49]That's alright.
[47:28.39]That's fine.
[47:28.87]I don't have to be best stream.
[47:37.07]Try Psycho Mode?
[47:37.79]Yeah, I'm definitely going to try Psycho Mode.
[47:40.29]Alright, I'm going to do Psycho Mode.
[47:48.67]Should I just start from the beginning?
[47:49.83]New game.
[47:55.18]Okay, Psycho Mode.
[47:59.26]New Conquest.
[48:05.05]What's the difference?
[48:06.88]Welcome to episode one of Jerma's Psycho Adventure.
[48:15.52]Screaming.
[48:16.38]I already have the bat.
[48:23.57]Okay.
[48:27.97]I got a raid come in too.
[48:30.61]From J6Dewaz.
[48:35.10]Thanks a lot.
[48:35.50]Welcome everybody.
[48:38.52]I'll sing the rain so- the rain song, sure.
[48:45.47]Thanks for coming.
[48:46.57]Playing a couple of games that some of the community members have made.
[48:49.45]And this is now we're in psycho mode.
[48:52.37]I have glasses on?
[48:56.51]Is this a whole new game?
[48:59.11]What's the difference?
[49:00.21]Oh shit.
[49:05.53]This is a different game.
[49:07.51]That other one was just practice for this.
[49:12.37]Oh my god.
[49:22.50]Freddy, Dredd, just give 50 community subs.
[49:24.10]Freddy, what are you up to?
[49:25.96]Freddy giving 50 subs?
[49:27.20]What?
[49:27.56]Freddy.
[49:29.11]Giving all these subs?
[49:30.21]Why are you giving all these subs, Freddy?
[49:33.41]That's a shitload.
[49:34.21]Welcome, everybody.
[49:34.75]What do you mean, welcome?
[49:36.72]Like, you've given a sub, you weren't here before?
[49:38.94]I combined the raid and the sub.
[49:42.72]Well, some of you that just raided might not have... Maybe you have one.
[49:45.10]Maybe you got one of the drops.
[49:48.86]Thanks a lot, Freddy.
[49:50.78]Seriously, that's a lot of money.
[49:54.67]Freddy's coming in hot.
[49:56.37]Hope you're doing well, Fred.
[49:58.05]And I just called you Fred.
[49:58.89]Are we on those terms yet?
[50:00.21]Can I call you Fred?
[50:04.07]Loose.
[50:07.67]I didn't- Oh, I just jumped in.
[50:16.67]You just made it awkward.
[50:17.69]No, I didn't!
[50:21.66]I've- I've hung out with Freddy Red in real life, okay?
[50:24.36]It's not awkward.
[50:25.40]We know each other.
[50:31.78]Oh my god.
[50:40.32]Now he's just flexing.
[50:44.92]You don't know Freddy like I do.
[50:48.38]Rats.
[50:49.30]We're rats.
[50:50.72]We're the rats.
[50:52.92]We pray at night.
[50:54.05]We stalk at night.
[50:55.51]We're the rats.
[50:58.09]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[51:02.57]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[51:06.63]So what do they do?
[51:09.40]Uh oh, I've been spotted.
[51:13.54]Nice.
[51:13.86]So what, I'm just like a psycho on the loose?
[51:24.81]Now I'm really curious as to how this ends.
[51:28.55]We were on baby mode before, now we're in the real game.
[51:31.55]That was just tutorial.
[51:39.54]Wow, this makes me want to install Hollow Knight.
[51:43.64]Tell everybody I'm going to play it.
[51:44.88]And then fucking play it for an hour and then never play it again.
[51:47.48]I just want to play that now.
[51:49.02]But only for like an hour.
[51:50.06]And then never play it again.
[51:50.70]I think I got the hang of this.
[51:54.50]Onion ring!
[51:57.40]I got an onion ring!
[52:10.36]This actually looks fun.
[52:11.54]This is fun.
[52:26.95]I wish he would do the doy doy doy again.
[52:28.53]Alright, just for you I'll do it again.
[52:31.33]I'm gonna do a big one.
[52:35.11]Is it gonna rival any of the doy doy doys I've ever done on this channel?
[52:40.40]He's laughing at his own joke.
[52:41.45]I'm laughing at what the guy said on camera on the screen.
[52:46.89]It was funny.
[52:47.35]It wasn't even me.
[52:48.51]That's a character that I played.
[52:50.27]It's not me.
[52:53.37]That was for that one person.
[53:00.88]Oh, fuck.
[53:01.28]Watch out.
[53:03.62]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[53:15.55]Yeah, I do laugh at my own jokes.
[53:24.37]Yeah, I think I'm the funniest damn person.
[53:29.28]Actually, I kind of don't.
[53:33.56]I laugh at other people's interpretations of the things that I say.
[53:35.94]That's what makes me laugh more than anything, I think.
[53:40.85]And people making stuff like this... Holy shit, he's big.
[53:50.87]I can't wait till I... Well, not... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[53:53.53]Not, I can't wait.
[53:55.43]Let's rephrase that.
[53:56.56]I was gonna say, I'm looking forward to eventually when I'm done streaming.
[54:01.14]I'm not looking forward to that.
[54:02.36]Like, let's... Hold on.
[54:03.26]I gotta... How do I phrase this?
[54:05.66]When I eventually am not streaming anymore and I'm one of those people that does, like, a comedy course at college... Hold on.
[54:16.01]I can't wait to do a comedy course.
[54:17.47]What?
[54:21.40]Teach, like, once a week.
[54:25.20]Uh, humor.
[54:25.90]Humorist.
[54:26.54]Jerma985 teaches, uh, kids at the local, uh, I don't know, like, local, like, state school.
[54:36.60]I'm definitely not good enough for anything besides just, like, a, like a, like a, like a two-year school.
[54:41.84]Nobody wants to bring me in for, like, a, like a four-year school.
[54:44.32]Nope.
[54:44.88]Won't happen.
[54:55.76]I'm not prestigious enough for their, for their big, big wonderful like four to five year master's program.
[55:02.45]Fuck yeah, I don't need that.
[55:07.17]You come to my, you come to my class, you'll learn.
[55:14.57]Comedy instructor, yep.
[55:18.03]In the first day of class, I'm gonna come in in a costume.
[55:21.89]And I'm not gonna introduce myself.
[55:24.65]I'm gonna make, like, noises and, like, get on the table on top of the, like, where the desk is.
[55:29.25]And be, like, making elephant sounds and shit and, like, lying on my back and, like, scratching my ears like a dog and stuff.
[55:34.11]And then I'm gonna get up.
[55:35.05]I'm gonna take all the costumes off.
[55:37.42]And I'm gonna say, those of you that didn't take notes on what just happened, get up and leave the class.
[55:45.76]Serious people only.
[55:59.52]They're like, I wouldn't even show up to class half the time.
[56:06.96]I would just forget.
[56:07.70]There's like 30 students just sitting there waiting in the lecture hall.
[56:13.25]I'm just not there.
[56:16.69]Did I say the same shit that I say to you guys?
[56:18.25]Oh yeah, Otto had to go out, so I'm not streaming today.
[56:24.56]What?
[56:24.74]Yeah, I had to take my dog out.
[56:27.44]Sorry, it's been six hours.
[56:31.73]Um, okay.
[56:36.41]So you've lied.
[56:37.19]No, I've never lied.
[56:43.80]Actually, I had a tweet lined up.
[56:47.48]It's in my drafts right now.
[56:50.28]Let me read it to you.
[56:51.22]Let me read you precisely the tweet.
[56:52.60]Tweet says, and I didn't send it because I was like, no, I want to stream today.
[56:57.92]Because I did, this did happen.
[57:03.46]So the tweet says, I wrote this last night.
[57:09.19]Hey guys, no stream tomorrow.
[57:11.77]I hurt my balls yesterday.
[57:13.93]I accidentally smushed them.
[57:15.93]I'll let you know when I'm coming back.
[57:20.77]I just wasn't going to stream today.
[57:23.42]But I did smush my balls though.
[57:25.20]That's not a lie.
[57:26.44]But I was like, no, I'll be okay.
[57:28.04]I can do it.
[57:33.66]But yeah, I was gonna cancel the stream today because I squished my balls.
[57:41.66]And I was like, is it worth canceling the stream for people to see that?
[57:45.28]Maybe they'll be worth it?
[57:46.24]Maybe you think it was funny?
[57:47.16]I don't know.
[57:48.97]But I was like, no, I want to stream.
[57:50.97]Even if it's for a little while.
[57:54.97]Wait, now?
[57:56.19]But I'm live right now.
[58:01.23]No stream tomorrow?
[58:13.81]Hold on, I gotta pay attention.
[58:15.62]Tweet it now.
[58:16.62]Giant enemy spider.
[58:17.92]Do you plan on streaming tomorrow?
[58:20.68]No.
[58:21.80]But that was because I was planning on not streaming today.
[58:25.30]But then I had this other epiphany in my brain.
[58:29.64]And look, listen to me.
[58:32.26]So those of you that have been following this channel for a long time.
[58:35.92]Been here for a while.
[58:36.74]Years, a lot of you.
[58:38.18]Which, first of all, that's crazy.
[58:39.98]I'm like surprised every day that people still watch this and still think that...
[58:45.37]Stuff like that is still funny to you.
[58:48.74]But if you've been watching and noticing the sus over the last three or four years, any time I ever plan to do, oh, hey, I'll be live like Monday or Tuesday.
[58:59.00]Yeah, I'll be live on maybe like, I don't know, Saturday or Sunday.
[59:02.96]If there's within three or four days of time ahead of that stream, it's guaranteed to be the next day.
[59:09.79]If you see me right Monday or Tuesday, the stream is on Wednesday.
[59:12.67]Every time.
[59:15.64]Uh, so, even though I smushed my balls, I was like, no, I can't.
[59:20.04]No.
[59:21.24]I'm not delaying to Wednesday.
[59:22.51]Nope.
[59:23.61]I don't care how smushed they are.
[59:24.53]And make no mistake, they're painful.
[59:27.93]It's painful.
[59:29.23]But I was not going to do that again.
[59:38.03]Ow.
[59:44.67]I don't know, it's... Then it just, it happened, okay?
[59:52.47]I'm not gonna give you specifics of how, it just did.
[59:59.55]Sometimes, you sit down too fast, or too weirdly, or you turn a weird way where you're sleeping.
[60:06.59]Or sometimes you, you fall.
[60:19.89]I'm laughing because somebody said he paid somebody to do it.
[60:26.39]Sorry guys, I can't stream tomorrow.
[60:28.77]I had somebody come over and smush my balls.
[60:33.67]That makes that tweet.
[60:37.40]No, no, no, no, no.
[60:38.20]Okay, alright, alright.
[60:39.44]We gotta move on from this, but just know.
[60:42.02]Just know the stream was almost canceled today.
[60:44.36]But I smushed... Whatever.
[60:48.61]People are writing like, huh?
[60:50.19]Just relax.
[60:51.00]It's fine.
[60:52.18]Everything's going to be fine.
[60:57.15]Is it left or right?
[60:58.03]It's both.
[61:04.84]how is not the question the question is it did is the question is is right no no it's not the it's not the how it's the why it's not the why either it's the it's the who what when it's the when it was last night or tonight whatever whatever it was I don't remember it's the it happened it is it did
[61:33.60]It's not the... I'm not tiny.
[61:37.08]I'm compact.
[61:39.65]The only information you have to have is there was a... I got smushed somehow.
[61:46.09]And that's it.
[61:52.89]You just dug yourself a grave.
[61:54.49]You never cease to impress that.
[61:55.59]I mean, how you... It's not fine.
[61:58.64]It's not... There's no who.
[62:00.14]It's not a who.
[62:02.99]It is.
[62:03.83]Alright, get out of here.
[62:05.13]Fan everybody that says smush.
[62:07.91]Time out everybody that says the word smush and then that's it.
[62:10.01]Shit, be careful.
[62:21.25]Fuck.
[62:22.67]Fuck!
[62:25.87]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:29.97]I don't want to kill them.
[62:32.32]Oh, thankfully they plan for that.
[62:34.04]Hit it.
[62:35.42]There you go.
[62:40.50]Fuck.
[62:43.40]Fuck.
[62:44.97]Fuck.
[62:46.75]Fuck.
[62:47.27]Fuck.
[62:48.23]Fuck.
[62:48.59]Fuck.
[62:59.32]This is the lesson here?
[63:00.64]No, no, no.
[63:02.49]This whole thing did not turn into a routine where I'm still the professor at the college.
[63:08.35]This actually happened.
[63:11.45]Somebody thinks that I'm talking about being the professor still.
[63:15.37]This is not like the lesson plan.
[63:16.66]I gotta hit it up.
[63:27.42]Damn it.
[63:32.51]How many more are there?
[63:36.93]I was taking notes.
[63:37.87]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on!
[63:45.01]No!
[63:48.45]We're good!
[63:57.00]Shit, is it one more?
[64:01.40]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, shit.
[64:04.32]Oh my god, he's aiming down.
[64:07.02]Oh my goodness, okay.
[64:09.42]I gotta get up top first.
[64:13.78]Will this be on the test?
[64:16.76]There are no tests in my classroom.
[64:21.30]Everybody has to do a performance.
[64:23.54]There are no tests.
[64:25.89]You have a five minute piece, or ten minute piece you have to do at the end of the year.
[64:30.71]And then I am the sole judge if it was funny enough for you to pass the glass.
[64:35.93]That's it.
[64:42.24]Shit.
[64:44.18]Shit!
[64:44.66]You wanna get baits, Dave?
[64:51.39]Is that what you want?
[64:54.88]Dermot, you're a cool professor.
[64:56.06]That's what I'm going for, man.
[64:57.82]I want, like, a cool... I want to have that cool professor vibe.
[65:01.38]Shit.
[65:04.43]Alright, I have to pay attention.
[65:09.73]I'm not paying attention.
[65:11.83]Okay, now right here.
[65:19.76]Fuck!
[65:21.22]Oh my god.
[65:21.80]Alright.
[65:24.78]If I don't get an A, my mom is going to send me to the glue factory.
[65:28.62]I... What do you mean?
[65:31.28]To work?
[65:33.12]What do you mean?
[65:34.00]You're going to go to the glue factory?
[65:39.99]Oh, okay.
[65:42.71]I'm going to go to the factory.
[65:43.83]Okay.
[65:50.97]Okay.
[65:56.19]Shit, I suck.
[65:57.23]I suck at this.
[66:01.56]I gotta move.
[66:13.06]Just move.
[66:13.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[66:18.57]No, you... Fuck.
[66:26.49]Holy shit, okay.
[66:31.99]I need to- I gotta heal.
[66:42.04]Holy god, did I get it?
[66:43.00]Is there one more?
[66:44.20]Shit.
[66:46.50]Come on, I need to heal.
[66:50.62]I think- is there more?
[66:51.94]Oh my god.
[66:59.74]Jesus.
[67:03.50]Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[67:13.52]This is the weirdest class I've ever been to.
[67:21.52]Keep distance from warlocks.
[67:28.55]I can kill them if I do one hit.
[67:29.83]Nice.
[67:46.41]When's the parent-teacher conference?
[67:48.89]You don't have those as a college professor.
[67:53.05]I just show up and I do my lesson plan and then I just leave.
[68:07.40]This is a full heal.
[68:09.24]Oh, I'm gonna need it now.
[68:12.54]Oh my god!
[68:13.62]What are you, a professor in?
[68:16.70]A comedy?
[68:20.99]These teachers suck.
[68:21.71]He's playing video games.
[68:22.71]All class.
[68:28.77]Can you eat in class?
[68:30.99]Yes, as long as it's not crunchy.
[68:33.77]You can eat whatever you want as long as you're not going to make any crunch mouth sounds.
[68:42.52]And if it's chewy, chew with your mouth closed.
[68:45.16]I don't want to hear the, like, the chewy shit.
[68:49.18]Crunchy is loud.
[68:50.30]Chewy can be loud if you open your mouth.
[68:59.41]Slurping is fine?
[69:00.15]No.
[69:01.55]If you can eat quietly, you can have it.
[69:03.09]Nothing crunchy.
[69:14.98]And no loud bags either.
[69:16.14]I don't want to hear that.
[69:18.19]It'll distract me.
[69:23.03]No, don't bring like Lay's potato chip bags in.
[69:25.11]You're going to crinkle up.
[69:25.91]No.
[69:26.69]Don't do that.
[69:34.34]You're going to bring the smelliest food imaginable.
[69:39.25]No, you can't have that either.
[69:40.59]It can't be crunchy.
[69:42.69]It can't be chewy.
[69:43.83]It can't smell.
[69:45.59]And it can't be hot.
[69:49.26]Because that's a hazard.
[69:52.92]You can't have a bowl of spaghetti in the room.
[69:54.96]Because what if you drop it on somebody?
[69:56.06]It burns them or something.
[70:03.44]That'll make a mess.
[70:04.06]Yeah, no.
[70:08.18]Pop-tarts?
[70:08.68]Pop-tarts are absolutely perfect.
[70:12.48]Yogurt?
[70:13.40]That's really good.
[70:15.14]That'd be okay.
[70:22.23]Pop-tarts crinkle.
[70:24.11]No, not if you're quiet.
[70:25.23]If you tear it right at the top and you make it really silent, it doesn't make a loud noise.
[70:29.13]It's very light foil.
[70:36.37]There's three more of these guys.
[70:37.73]Where are they?
[70:41.11]What if it's for comedy?
[70:44.41]Um, it better be really funny.
[70:48.19]If you're doing a look at I have a loud potato chip bag routine, it better be really funny.
[70:58.73]I fart in my chip bag.
[71:02.32]That might be funny.
[71:04.20]Where do you do this?
[71:05.86]Do you just come up and say, excuse me, I need to interrupt the class, and then fart into your bake lays?
[71:10.34]Okay, yeah, that's funny.
[71:19.14]See?
[71:21.02]I mean, I would tell you to sit down.
[71:22.26]I'd be like, alright, now sit down.
[71:24.28]You little shit.
[71:33.28]order a pizza to the class no unless it was but here's how you would do that you would be absent and so one of your peers that's also in the comedy class would be like I'm gonna order a pizza you would order the pizza I would have marked you absent you would show up 20 minutes later in a pizza guy outfit delivering the pizza to the class I would give you a I would give you a stamp on that one
[72:13.24]It has to be pepperoni with cheese.
[72:15.64]Well, then you would know that's my favorite pizza, so you get, you know, points with the teacher.
[72:21.52]And then if you got into the class, and you had the bag of Lay's, and when you got in, okay, so the pizza delivery is called.
[72:30.95]You show up.
[72:32.71]You say, oh, somebody ordered pizza?
[72:34.55]And it's like, oh, there he is.
[72:35.77]There's the absent guy.
[72:37.45]And you immediately grab a full bag of baked Lay's, and you just fart directly into it.
[72:42.43]I think that would probably give you an A. That combines both things you're talking about.
[72:46.87]Now that person passed, they don't have to come to class anymore.
[73:20.66]What if you come to class in a fursuit?
[73:23.66]It's probably kind of hot in there.
[73:30.53]I mean, as long as I can verify that it was you.
[73:38.49]I don't know what your routine is.
[73:43.00]Okay, no, okay.
[73:44.44]If you had an Anthrocon badge on around your neck,
[73:49.74]And you came to the wrong place.
[73:52.12]You'd be like, okay, that's funny.
[73:56.73]You would pass and you could leave.
[73:59.63]Oh fuck, watch out.
[74:03.21]Is it like a currency thing?
[74:05.52]What do you mean he knows?
[74:10.44]Just because I know it exists?
[74:20.36]I told you guys what I wanted to do one day.
[74:21.78]I've never done it.
[74:22.72]I wanted to dress up in a full fursuit and just go and just blend in and have no one ever know it was me.
[74:35.57]I would be in my hotel room is the only time I would ever take off that costume.
[74:41.34]I would not talk.
[74:42.18]I would not tell anyone.
[74:44.00]No one would ever know.
[74:47.83]I would just have to make sure that when I got in the hotel room, there was nobody else with me.
[74:55.10]Everything's closed.
[74:55.92]All the blinds are closed.
[74:56.96]Everything is closed.
[74:57.58]Nobody can... It's impossible.
[75:00.74]I would leave my cell phone... I would leave my cell phone at home.
[75:07.76]That couldn't get fucking tracked.
[75:09.45]Nothing.
[75:09.85]Nothing.
[75:10.63]Nothing.
[75:11.45]Just go.
[75:20.19]It would be a big elaborate costume.
[75:21.63]There's no way you could ever find out.
[75:26.89]You know, don't say swears.
[75:32.06]What would be the point of it if nobody found out?
[75:34.78]You failed.
[75:40.99]Hand in your syllabus.
[75:43.99]Hand in your fucking comedy token.
[75:47.05]Sorry, you failed the class.
[76:10.44]Comedy tokens?
[76:12.83]One star on Rate My Professor.
[76:18.29]No way!
[76:18.95]I would have 5... I would be at least 4.5.
[76:23.93]You're telling... Okay, hold on a minute.
[76:26.22]You're saying that if you had a class, that you just had to impress the professor for like a minute, and you got an A, and you didn't have to go anymore, and this guy lets you eat food in class...
[76:37.30]And all he cares about is you doing a little comedy routine and then he passes you.
[76:42.37]You don't have to go any- Are you serious?
[76:46.29]I feel like that would be full of five star reviews.
[76:57.33]What an ego.
[77:02.88]How much is the class?
[77:03.88]That's a good question.
[77:10.06]Um, how much would the class be?
[77:16.58]I feel like... It definitely wouldn't be free, but it wouldn't be expensive.
[77:32.79]It would be like the cost of going to see Cirque du Soleil in the back row.
[77:41.77]Alright.
[77:42.25]Maybe like 40 bucks?
[77:45.56]30 bucks?
[77:46.00]How much does Circus Delay take?
[77:49.06]Is it expensive?
[77:50.22]I thought it was like 40 bucks to go see Circus Delay.
[77:55.52]32 bucks?
[77:56.94]Is it more than 100?
[77:57.30]Oh my god, I have to heal.
[78:00.00]I just got headshot.
[78:02.24]Fuck.
[78:02.52]Okay, I wasn't paying attention.
[78:13.79]Fuck, alright, let me just beat this first and we'll talk more about this stuff.
[78:25.37]You're worth Cirque du Soleil money?
[78:29.17]I mean, it's... How much is it for like a class in college right now?
[78:33.70]It's just way too fucking expensive.
[78:50.86]Depends.
[78:52.82]How much is a front row seat at Cirque du Soleil?
[78:57.31]I wonder.
[78:59.67]Maybe, it's probably like four or five hundred bucks for like a front row seat.
[79:04.31]Five hundred?
[79:09.26]Fuck, alright.
[79:12.00]God damn it.
[79:15.28]About three fifty?
[79:17.48]Yeah.
[79:18.34]Usually around one to two K. Holy shit, really?
[79:26.22]Oh my god, I'm getting just juggled.
[79:30.64]Stay back here and heal.
[79:34.10]Alright, let's go.
[79:46.50]Why would wearing a fur suit be hot?
[79:47.66]Do you think furries are hot?
[79:48.72]Are you a furry now?
[79:49.48]What is... Why is... What?
[79:52.95]Like, I'm talking temperature-wise.
[79:54.29]It'd probably be pretty toasty in there.
[80:05.18]Oh, Darkest Dungeon 2 comes out, right?
[80:07.80]In like four or five days?
[80:09.50]When does that come out?
[80:10.64]I want to play that.
[80:25.49]Yes, because it's a topic I care very deeply about.
[80:28.37]This shit is bouncing, that's what's going on.
[80:43.60]Oh my god, Jeremy, come on.
[80:45.42]Alright.
[80:51.28]Well, it's not a change of subject, we were done with that other subject and I moved on to a new one.
[80:57.66]I didn't change the subject.
[80:58.86]I went to another topic.
[81:00.24]Because we were done with the first one.
[81:05.07]Oh my god!
[81:05.85]You got greedy!
[81:11.32]We were not done?
[81:12.94]What do you mean?
[81:13.48]You want to go back and talk about my smushed balls?
[81:22.23]I don't.
[81:34.38]Shit.
[81:34.64]Oh my god.
[81:37.69]Watch out.
[81:40.81]That was actually kind of scary.
[81:44.81]Oh god.
[81:50.13]Oh, get back up here.
[81:53.32]Way too many.
[81:57.70]Okay.
[82:03.87]Go to the big one.
[82:04.43]Alright, now I can go down.
[82:13.39]Oh shit, he got hit by that on the way back.
[82:15.11]I think that's it down here.
[82:21.48]Is this game canon?
[82:26.92]Uh, it's in the Jerma Extended Universe.
[82:54.54]Alright, there's only one more.
[82:55.90]One more magician.
[82:56.86]Alright, that's it.
[82:57.96]Are there any non-canon screams?
[83:00.83]Ah, the smite ones.
[83:22.09]Is this a secret?
[83:22.57]Did I miss it?
[83:24.25]No, we've already seen it.
[83:24.91]This is just Psycho mode.
[83:25.67]I already got to the top of this before, right?
[83:33.54]Did I do it again?
[83:36.42]I mean, might as well.
[83:37.10]Did I miss something?
[83:53.34]Wait, Chad, Jerma isn't canon.
[83:59.73]Um, yeah, I mean, yeah, he is.
[84:05.39]I said Smite, well, Smite streams are not canon.
[84:14.51]I think a canon stream is the ones that, you know, the big projects probably.
[84:19.48]Those are all canon streams.
[84:25.26]We got 20 community subs?
[84:28.28]Afmeric, thanks for the 20 community subs.
[84:29.68]Appreciate it, thank you.
[84:32.20]Thanks for 20 subs.
[84:33.30]2-0.
[84:35.98]Are you going to put an edible in the Jerma rumble?
[84:41.44]Oh no, that's not what you said.
[84:42.32]I don't know why I read that like that.
[84:47.62]As a character?
[84:48.38]You want to get bake-staved?
[84:51.69]Is that what you want?
[84:55.95]Damn it!
[84:56.25]There we go.
[84:56.89]Is there anything up here?
[84:58.37]What about the JCU?
[85:00.19]The Cinematic Universe?
[85:03.12]Yeah.
[85:04.66]For sure.
[85:06.34]Oh la la.
[85:26.30]Hey, Near, thanks for the eight.
[85:28.56]You know how we say it here.
[85:29.28]Say it with me.
[85:31.77]Community subs.
[85:34.25]Everybody says it, and we all, like, laugh.
[85:35.65]It's an old thing we do.
[85:38.81]Oh, community.
[85:39.35]It's Otto.
[85:39.71]I love Otto.
[86:01.32]Mr. Otto.
[86:02.90]Alright, we're getting to the end of Psycho Mode.
[86:05.60]I think I've done pretty well.
[86:18.37]Alright.
[86:19.29]Watch it.
[86:20.67]What the fuck are you doing?
[86:21.73]What is he doing?
[86:22.23]Hey, jermaOn A5 here.
[86:30.44]He killed Otto in Resident Evil 8?
[86:33.62]What are you talking about?
[86:42.05]Stop being greedy and get him!
[86:50.37]You idiot.
[86:56.50]Guy in the big barn?
[86:57.52]There's a secret boss?
[87:00.70]Big barn.
[87:04.66]We have to go back to the casino.
[87:15.26]Whoa.
[87:20.14]Oh my God, I'm not going to die in here, am I?
[87:27.30]What the fuck?
[87:28.34]No, I can't do this.
[87:34.38]Fuck I didn't finish the joke and I and now I'm gonna die Fuck oh my god, I can't what the hell man.
[87:49.63]I can't No, how far back is the checkpoint?
[87:56.84]Oh Thank God No, wait, it's all the way back the other room
[88:05.54]It's not.
[88:05.96]Thank goodness.
[88:07.46]Alright, well, I can't gamble.
[88:08.72]I'm not gonna get killed.
[88:09.80]Casino.
[88:15.23]Alright, fine.
[88:37.13]I can't!
[88:41.53]What is it?
[88:42.93]Lemon?
[88:43.71]Lemon?
[88:45.55]Lemon?
[88:47.17]Oh, fuck.
[88:50.87]Never mind.
[88:51.33]We're going right by it.
[89:16.06]Okay.
[89:18.44]Get away from me.
[89:22.40]I wonder how the final boss changes.
[89:28.44]Nope?
[89:28.80]Alright.
[89:29.10]Holy shit, this is gonna be so hard.
[89:34.93]I'm gonna stay down here.
[89:43.58]Yeah, fuck it.
[89:44.14]I'm staying here.
[89:51.91]I... Just cheese this encounter.
[90:23.79]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[90:33.30]Bring him over here.
[90:33.74]Can I get him over here?
[90:55.90]Alright, one more time, and then it's it.
[90:57.48]I get the true, true ending.
[90:59.86]But there'll probably be two different endings, right?
[91:08.72]Ow.
[91:10.46]Am I flying?
[91:14.11]What the fuck was that?
[91:16.45]Oh, shit.
[91:17.43]Oh my god, just hide down here.
[91:21.67]Is it like a currency thing?
[91:22.59]Fuck, I didn't get it.
[91:23.33]It's alright, I'll get it.
[91:29.19]This is bad.
[91:31.05]This is really bad.
[91:31.67]This is really bad.
[91:32.19]I'm tied.
[91:32.65]Where are the dinosaurs?
[91:50.98]They're gone.
[91:55.64]Where are they?
[91:58.56]do they fall down alright I win this doesn't seem like I can't move can they shoot me no good alright
[92:28.26]Fog, I just got Feeding Frenzy 2 to run on my laptop.
[92:30.54]Holy shit, that's a celebration moment.
[92:32.48]This is not Smite.
[92:43.93]No.
[92:45.35]Smite was fun.
[92:57.24]Alright, I can still get the... Hold on.
[92:58.86]Break this, but don't kill everybody.
[93:00.40]Actually, kill these people, but don't break the boxes.
[93:05.02]Oh, shit.
[93:12.99]Hold on.
[93:13.65]God damn it.
[93:14.55]Get out of the way.
[93:29.02]Is this the guy that beat Spamton, Jevil, and Jerma Dinosaur first try?
[93:35.32]It is.
[93:35.54]I'm just going.
[93:49.01]Alright, here we go.
[93:52.01]I'm not going to kill him.
[93:52.81]Let's see if we get the true ending.
[93:57.08]And then we'll do the other ending too.
[93:58.78]Just to make sure we cover all the bases.
[94:01.14]I didn't press anything.
[94:15.31]After his brutal conquest, Jerma obtained the prize chips for real this time.
[94:27.79]Oh, I get it.
[94:28.35]Okay.
[94:28.51]792.
[94:28.53]Very cool.
[94:28.77]I think that's it.
[95:03.73]There's another one lined up here to play.
[95:04.99]That's right, Kevin McCloud is the master of royalty-free music.
[95:13.55]Tried to get 985 for the secret ending.
[95:16.19]Is that accurate?
[95:22.24]What happens if you get 985 punnies?
[95:24.94]Can we confirm with the dev that that's real?
[95:38.37]Is it real?
[95:43.69]You can't because they're in multiples of two.
[95:45.59]You can't get an odd number.
[95:49.52]Oh, okay.
[95:58.04]Alright, well that was cool.
[95:59.58]That was from Warbill?
[96:02.28]Warbill?
[96:03.57]Where are you?
[96:07.58]Warbler.
[96:08.28]Warbler.
[96:10.00]Warbler.
[96:12.04]Stats, rather.
[96:16.76]Lowest score.
[96:17.44]Highest score.
[96:18.68]I unlocked all these.
[96:23.45]Oh, I see.
[96:23.91]It's different modes.
[96:27.09]That was really cool.
[96:28.57]I'm going to play the next one.
[96:30.53]The next one is a point-and-click adventure game.
[96:35.50]thank you that was really really awesome I think it's called auto's great adventure or something switch to it uh we're at well so we'll take a break I'll go BRB go p come back play that on I'll be right back
[100:01.78]I forgot to say I was back.
[100:02.76]Hi.
[100:04.57]Sorry about that.
[100:09.99]Jerma in auto.
[100:11.33]The curse of the late streamer.
[100:20.64]Music can stay here.
[100:21.52]Sound effects.
[100:24.86]That sounds pretty good.
[100:26.48]Turn it up a little bit.
[100:30.03]Alright, so this is apparently a point-and-click adventure game.
[100:32.11]We're gonna do a new game.
[100:35.09]You guys ready?
[100:38.22]Somewhere in the Nevada desert.
[100:39.98]Around 12 to 1 p.m.
[100:42.74]Pacific.
[100:48.32]Anthony Banthrey, I'm going for the middle class.
[100:49.99]Ha ha ha.
[101:02.28]That's how it feels sometimes.
[101:14.31]This is actually how it is.
[101:15.59]I'm not even kidding.
[101:19.24]I'm late for the stream.
[101:20.10]Chat's gonna kill me.
[101:21.12]That's how it feels.
[101:24.10]If I know that it's gonna take me like 30 minutes to get ready, and I'm just like, fuck, they're just probably so... I'm trying to go as fast as I can.
[101:33.75]I better get over to my computer room as soon as possible.
[101:36.23]Okay.
[101:42.57]I have a toy.
[101:43.27]Look at rug.
[101:43.93]Okay, use rug.
[101:47.84]Oh shit, there's a key under here.
[101:49.62]Give me that key.
[101:55.93]I wonder what this opens.
[101:56.81]Looks kinda dorky.
[102:01.02]Looks kinda dorky.
[102:03.04]Get it?
[102:04.44]Oh shit, I didn't until right now.
[102:05.80]Dorky.
[102:06.46]Okay.
[102:06.94]Come on.
[102:07.30]Adventure games have to have bad puns.
[102:10.76]Is it my stomach?
[102:12.63]This is crazy.
[102:13.45]Okay.
[102:16.55]Bed.
[102:18.29]This is where the magic happens.
[102:20.45]I'm gonna give you a fully voice acted game, by the way.
[102:22.65]You understand?
[102:29.30]Mirror.
[102:31.68]Whoa.
[102:32.46]Who's that handsome hunk staring back at me?
[102:37.86]You can do this today.
[102:38.96]You're gonna go out there and you're gonna show everyone what you're made of.
[102:41.80]You're gonna show everybody what you're capable of.
[102:44.30]Not what anyone else is.
[102:45.92]What you are.
[102:47.10]You have what it takes.
[102:47.86]This is a map of the cartoon town I live in.
[102:57.02]Toy blocks.
[102:59.83]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[103:00.87]I'm sorry, what?
[103:06.57]Use toy blocks.
[103:09.65]I think they can stay where they are.
[103:14.81]This is my prized possession.
[103:16.48]Made with real diamonds.
[103:23.42]Blue raspberry flavored.
[103:30.14]Oh, it's, it's, wait, 11?
[103:33.72]I don't know.
[103:36.29]I don't think changing the clock is gonna make me any less late.
[103:38.79]Anything else I can do in here?
[103:42.23]I got a key.
[103:43.45]I have a diamond pickaxe.
[103:47.15]Let's go.
[103:50.58]Bedroom door, outside door.
[103:53.80]I look outside.
[103:56.16]Reddit room door.
[103:57.36]Okay, well, who's on the air?
[103:58.82]Not me.
[104:00.98]There's no time for distractions.
[104:02.06]I've got a stream to start.
[104:07.13]It's locked.
[104:07.59]I must have left the key around here somewhere.
[104:12.25]This does not happen where I live.
[104:15.51]Because I would hide this key and forget about it and forget it and have to put a shoulder into the door to get in here.
[104:20.99]I wouldn't do that.
[104:22.45]Okay, there we go.
[104:30.70]Holy shit.
[104:31.74]This is my room.
[104:36.98]This is crazy.
[104:40.54]This is actually one-to-one accurate.
[104:44.91]Can I go in the closet?
[104:47.81]Reddit shelf.
[104:50.47]My Reddit shelf is empty.
[104:51.81]I must have misplaced all my Funko Puffs.
[104:54.83]I should keep an eye out for them.
[104:56.87]Sounds like some sort of side mission that isn't important to the main goal.
[105:00.73]I'm sure that'll be in the DLC.
[105:05.55]When does Lenarwal bacon?
[105:10.00]Epic.
[105:20.50]Cool, yep.
[105:24.24]It's also accurate.
[105:29.61]Dog bed?
[105:30.15]I wonder where Otto has wandered off to.
[105:34.93]If I move his bed, where's Otto gonna sleep?
[105:39.68]Roto beasts.
[105:42.26]Yep.
[105:49.28]You must complete all your chores before streaming.
[105:54.30]I forgot to do my chores.
[105:59.10]Before stream.
[105:59.92]Looks like chat might have to wait a minute.
[106:01.50]I'm sure they won't mind.
[106:02.78]This is completely accurate.
[106:09.50]Yeah, find something to eat.
[106:10.78]Sandwich does sound good right about now.
[106:12.28]All I would need is bread, mayo, and steak yum brand meat.
[106:18.15]That's right.
[106:18.63]Otto needs to go on a walk.
[106:19.65]I haven't seen him for a while.
[106:20.85]I wonder where he went.
[106:23.72]Of course, I definitely can't stream without internet.
[106:26.36]Let's check the cable box outside, see if anything's broken.
[106:32.44]Okay, so these are the tasks.
[106:33.74]Alright, we're gonna take Otto for a walk and find something to eat.
[106:39.51]Cool, alright, let's go.
[106:40.73]Wait, what's this?
[106:41.69]Otto's note.
[106:45.55]Otto's note one.
[106:46.35]Hey, everybody.
[106:47.77]It's me, Otto.
[106:48.95]I'm off on a Big Adventure right now trying to find who stole the cookies.
[106:52.95]Are they outside?
[106:53.77]I should talk to the vroomer.
[106:56.21]He's always outside driving his motorcycle up and down the street.
[106:59.50]Love, Otto.
[107:02.48]Who stole the cookies?
[107:06.76]I'm going to find Otto.
[107:07.64]I've got to find whoever took all the cookies.
[107:11.00]I should talk to the vroomer.
[107:12.26]Maybe he knows where Otto is.
[107:18.09]Okay, so I can go this way now?
[107:22.01]Use wall.
[107:23.95]I don't know what good my hands would do against solid stone.
[107:33.85]Use wall.
[107:37.12]Oh god.
[107:39.06]Look at sign.
[107:40.88]It says VOD watchers skip one hour.
[107:44.54]Weird, I wonder what that means.
[107:51.16]Go to door on right.
[107:57.43]Go to door up.
[107:59.81]There's only one choice.
[108:04.13]Go door down.
[108:05.01]Go door left.
[108:10.67]Go door left.
[108:17.59]Go door up.
[108:18.83]Go door down.
[108:28.87]Go up.
[108:40.22]Alright, there's a pattern here that I'm missing.
[108:41.86]Okay, there's two torches on this one.
[108:44.14]Is that, like, yes and no?
[108:45.91]Like, one torch is no, two torches is yes or something?
[108:49.35]What the fuck am I talking about?
[108:51.17]What are you talking about?
[108:53.55]There's more than one door in each room.
[108:55.85]What?
[108:59.31]Oh, this room is no!
[109:01.23]Okay.
[109:02.08]What?
[109:10.81]I don't get it.
[109:11.17]I don't have any items.
[109:24.02]Okay.
[109:27.16]Maybe if a door has two torches on it, it means it's the real one.
[109:31.94]With one torch, you... I don't know.
[109:52.56]Let's go left.
[109:58.43]Down and left, maybe?
[110:03.22]The torches don't mean anything.
[110:05.50]I found it.
[110:11.22]I must have gone the wrong way.
[110:12.21]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[110:20.81]Secret button that kills you.
[110:23.13]Should I press it?
[110:23.65]That's a callback, isn't it?
[110:55.06]What happened?
[110:56.10]I have a feeling that wasn't the right way.
[110:57.78]I should check the maze again.
[110:59.36]What?
[110:59.62]Yep, still a mailbox.
[111:08.07]Hmm, it's empty.
[111:08.87]I'll have to check back later.
[111:12.03]Did I get in the road?
[111:12.67]Dean Dingus lost my vote after he strangled three people.
[111:19.09]If I put it away now, people will call me a centrist Andy.
[111:24.67]Road!
[111:24.99]Alright, look at road.
[111:26.27]I've got to figure out a way to slow down the rumor to talk to him.
[111:31.07]Will he just hit me?
[111:32.62]I'm just in the road.
[111:34.74]Well, that was a close one.
[111:35.64]I should find a way of slowing him down.
[111:37.12]I'm not putting my hand on that.
[111:40.16]It's probably a thousand degrees.
[111:44.34]Telephone pole?
[111:46.96]Telephone pole.
[111:47.54]Looks pretty tall.
[111:53.51]Can I die up here?
[111:54.21]What the hell?
[112:10.69]Wow, I did not think it would be this high up.
[112:12.33]I hope there's no fall joke incoming.
[112:14.13]Of course there is.
[112:14.75]Looks like another balloon from Boston is coming in.
[112:24.55]It's a cable box screwed shut.
[112:26.11]This is probably where all the internet wires go.
[112:28.57]Listen, I don't really know how it works.
[112:30.05]Just trust me.
[112:31.23]Okay.
[112:32.33]I can't open it.
[112:32.91]It's screwed shut.
[112:33.65]I've got to find some item that will let me unscrew a screw.
[112:40.88]I need a screwdriver.
[112:41.56]I love the carnival in the distance.
[112:53.05]Pickaxe?
[112:53.43]I think I used it.
[112:53.99]I don't have it anymore.
[113:01.97]Okay.
[113:04.40]So I have to figure that maze out.
[113:05.50]Let's go back in the house.
[113:09.34]I need someone to slow down the rumor.
[113:11.06]What can I get?
[113:11.82]This is the Reddit room.
[113:15.78]What about further down here?
[113:16.60]Okay, hold on a minute.
[113:19.32]Let's see, man.
[113:19.98]Okay, hallway.
[113:27.37]It's the clowns in the house.
[113:29.21]Okay.
[113:33.17]Something about these two looks kind of funny.
[113:38.99]How do you keep getting into my house?
[113:44.75]Select an action.
[113:46.13]Alright.
[113:46.55]I want... How about some bread?
[113:48.09]Ask for bread.
[113:50.23]Hey, can I have some bread?
[113:53.63]I'll take that as a yes.
[113:55.50]Oh, nice.
[113:55.92]Alright.
[113:56.46]Quest complete.
[113:59.70]Find something to eat, right?
[114:00.46]I need more?
[114:04.86]How do you two keep getting into my house?
[114:06.72]Alright, what about flirt?
[114:08.62]You want to clown around for a bit?
[114:09.82]Didn't work.
[114:14.76]Uh, be rude.
[114:16.14]I hate your stupid clown guts.
[114:19.01]Oh, nothing.
[114:22.19]Can I get more food?
[114:25.63]Yeah.
[114:28.61]Flirt?
[114:28.91]You know what they say about guys with comically large shoes?
[114:35.40]I don't think they like this.
[114:37.32]Sliding doors?
[114:37.94]Go back.
[114:39.70]Oh, shit.
[114:40.19]Okay, hold on.
[114:43.85]Garbage?
[114:45.75]Banana peel.
[114:49.29]Banana was not very appealing.
[114:50.99]I know, I know.
[114:51.75]Sorry.
[114:55.92]Sunflowers!
[114:59.22]Anything else in here?
[115:00.88]No.
[115:03.87]It's in there.
[115:04.19]I've been doing some archaeology recently.
[115:07.79]Get it.
[115:08.01]Let's see.
[115:10.31]Geos, Grotto Beasts Cards, Buried Treasure.
[115:12.51]Aha!
[115:13.59]What's this?
[115:15.19]Looks like some ancient Greek tablet.
[115:16.75]I wonder how that got here.
[115:19.01]Okay, so this is a code?
[115:22.42]Alright, I gotta crack this code.
[115:30.22]Can I take it?
[115:33.36]A is A, B is B, T is G, triangle is D, E is E, Z is Z, H is E, O is Th, I is I, K is K, Thick?
[115:52.47]M is M, N is N, E is X, O is O, H is P, P is R, sideways M is E,
[116:02.52]Okay, so it's just the Greek alphabet.
[116:04.28]Okay.
[116:08.86]I feel like I'm going to need to know.
[116:11.09]I can't even say words.
[116:12.01]I'm trying to say it too fast.
[116:14.15]Slow down.
[116:14.53]I feel like I need to know that later.
[116:17.61]Say that's better.
[116:20.74]What's that last symbol called?
[116:22.00]Infinity.
[116:24.58]Infinity.
[116:29.49]We're the rats.
[116:31.69]We pray at night.
[116:32.81]We stalk at night.
[116:34.28]We're the rats.
[116:36.84]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[116:41.34]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[116:47.00]Okay.
[116:49.31]Use oven.
[116:51.55]Oh my god, it smells like death in there.
[116:55.05]What is in there?
[116:55.95]Is that a pot rose?
[116:57.01]How long has it been in there?
[117:00.00]Ugh.
[117:00.12]This oven is ruined.
[117:02.04]Gotta find time to clean it out later.
[117:07.61]Sandwich toaster 9000.
[117:08.61]Anything in the fridge?
[117:11.35]I must have locked it after too many midnight snack runs.
[117:17.69]Putting a padlock on your fridge.
[117:23.77]On my trusty sandwich toaster 3000.
[117:25.75]It automates the process of assembling the perfect sandwich.
[117:29.83]All you need is bread, steak yum, brand meat product, and tons of mayo.
[117:37.67]Seems like I'm missing some ingredients for the perfect sandwich.
[117:41.40]Wait, what?
[117:41.98]I have to regurgitate this into the toaster?
[117:50.73]I don't think this works with that.
[117:51.79]Okay, well this is the bread.
[118:01.45]Still need to find the other ingredients.
[118:02.80]Okay, so we need steak yum.
[118:10.06]Can I get that?
[118:13.52]Can't just reach in there?
[118:18.00]Ow, something bit me.
[118:19.96]Okay.
[118:23.22]Keep going.
[118:25.29]Use door.
[118:26.07]Go to casino.
[118:27.25]Why is there a casino in my house?
[118:36.72]You want to make that joke so bad.
[118:39.28]And you actually did it.
[118:42.50]Don't.
[118:43.96]Hey, jermaOn A5 here.
[118:50.33]It's the joke door.
[118:53.17]God.
[118:54.97]Fucking fire hits everyone.
[118:56.51]No, no, no, no.
[119:04.87]Alright, let's go to the casino.
[119:12.82]Oh, shit.
[119:15.16]Blackjack table, Mr. Green.
[119:17.96]These old people.
[119:27.37]Okay, Mr. Green.
[119:29.95]He's mean, he's green, he runs a casino in my living room.
[119:32.41]That's about it.
[119:37.45]Well, well, well, if it isn't little Jeremy Elbertson.
[119:40.85]Back for more gambling?
[119:43.40]Yep, time to make that money.
[119:44.86]Actually, I'm just trying to get to the living room.
[119:50.16]Uh, I'm just trying to get to the living room.
[119:52.70]Oh, Jeremy, it seems you've already forgotten about that little debt you owe me after your last visit.
[119:58.88]What was it again?
[119:59.64]5,000 bits?
[120:00.70]5,000 bits?! !
[120:05.41]Correct.
[120:06.41]You kept double or nothing until I had to cut you off.
[120:09.87]That being said, sorry.
[120:14.81]In a show of good faith, I'll loan you a thousand bits to get you off your feet.
[120:20.16]Thanks, I guess.
[120:21.56]Now run along and make yourself some money.
[120:27.20]You sure have a lot of money, Mr. Green.
[120:30.80]I do.
[120:31.54]It's all mine, and you can't have any of it.
[120:35.35]I have a question.
[120:40.05]How did you get all this money?
[120:42.13]How did you get all this money?
[120:44.44]Gambling, of course.
[120:46.26]And from idiots.
[120:48.56]I mean, gamers.
[120:49.88]Like you, of course.
[120:51.80]I almost lost it all investing in bald coin.
[120:56.76]Mr. Green, why are you green?
[120:59.64]Why are flamingos pink?
[121:02.54]Because they eat shrimp.
[121:05.42]Oh!
[121:08.06]Is that real?
[121:08.54]Alright, so I have a thousand bits.
[121:15.17]Are you kidding me?
[121:23.13]Can I save the game?
[121:24.25]Alright, save game.
[121:32.99]Auto save.
[121:33.65]Alright, new save.
[121:35.59]Okay.
[121:39.31]So, we have 1,000 bits.
[121:41.11]I need to get to 5,000 to pay off Mr. Green.
[121:44.87]No saves coming.
[121:45.79]What, am I going to replay the whole game again?
[121:46.95]We're going all in.
[121:49.95]All in.
[121:50.15]Let's go.
[121:53.23]13 versus 6.
[121:53.71]You stay on that.
[121:54.29]Don't move.
[121:54.83]He's going to bust right here.
[121:56.63]See you later.
[121:58.57]That's very bad.
[121:59.46]I lost everything.
[122:04.73]reset re wave refund refund that's what that's how you play that hand everyone like oh my god no if you have anything over a 12 versus a dealer showing a six you don't do anything that's the highest chance to win that hand you don't do anything you still no you just don't know how to play blackjack what do you mean nobody stands on 13. you are you don't know how to play this is basic blackjack strategy
[122:34.64]You don't hit on 13 versus 6.
[122:35.92]Are you mind?
[122:37.00]That's the bust hand.
[122:43.57]You don't hit on 13.
[122:46.91]What are you talking about?
[122:52.89]You never win at blackjack.
[122:54.12]Blackjack's my game, okay?
[122:56.72]That was a warm-up round.
[122:57.82]Mr. Green, do you have any money?
[122:59.54]I seem to be out of money.
[123:02.50]Wait, really?
[123:03.98]Already?
[123:05.57]I guess I'm not entirely surprised, but... Alright, what's a thousand more bits to Mr. Green anyway?
[123:10.11]Try not to lose it all again, Goku.
[123:11.45]Somebody just said, always hit below 15.
[123:16.86]That's not... Don't do that.
[123:20.94]Here we go.
[123:33.81]Always hit below 21.
[123:34.85]Alright, double aces.
[123:43.96]I want to split these.
[123:45.22]I want to split these.
[123:46.44]There it is.
[123:50.60]I'll get a 21.
[123:50.90]Alright, we're going to stay at 500.
[124:00.99]8 versus... Come on.
[124:02.94]That sucks.
[124:04.00]This sucks.
[124:04.64]I have to hit this.
[124:06.12]I had to.
[124:10.32]Yeah, 17 versus 9.
[124:11.06]I'm just going to lose.
[124:12.28]I always have to assume that there's a face card underneath there.
[124:16.47]You have to assume that there's a face card underneath there.
[124:22.06]Guys, guys, I have way more experience than you do loading up the Blackjack app on your phone for 15 minutes.
[124:28.13]You understand?
[124:30.15]That's not how you play Blackjack.
[124:42.54]I'm screwed again.
[124:43.20]I have to hit it again.
[124:45.08]See?
[124:45.32]That's why you do it.
[124:45.79]Because that's an 18.
[124:46.47]Do you see what happened?
[124:47.57]Do you understand now?
[124:50.65]Anything over an 8, you have to hit.
[124:52.63]If you don't have at least 18.
[124:53.51]You have to.
[124:56.79]Otherwise, they flip over the 10 and it's over.
[124:58.41]You lose.
[124:58.69]Go.
[125:04.68]This is bad.
[125:05.30]But, we're staying.
[125:06.16]You don't hit against a 16.
[125:07.48]Ever.
[125:08.78]You don't hit this.
[125:09.36]You just don't.
[125:11.26]That's why.
[125:12.18]See?
[125:13.72]Sit down.
[125:14.10]Sit down next to me.
[125:15.48]Pull up a chair and learn something.
[125:21.41]Fuck.
[125:22.21]This is bad.
[125:22.63]This is very bad.
[125:27.17]I have to hit this.
[125:27.85]This is very bad.
[125:28.44]I have to, though.
[125:29.58]Thank you very much.
[125:30.42]Okay, I'll take notes.
[125:32.94]Take notes.
[125:33.30]I just want... See?
[125:35.70]That hand is guaranteed to lose if you don't do what I just did.
[125:38.93]It's not lucky.
[125:40.01]It's statistics.
[125:54.15]I'll get a 10.
[125:54.45]There you go.
[125:55.73]He's gonna bust right there.
[125:56.49]Thank you.
[125:59.61]You can pay the debt back now?
[126:00.93]Yeah, but I got $400 of fun money.
[126:12.86]Had to hit that.
[126:25.29]I'm going to get 10 right here.
[126:27.05]There it is.
[126:29.47]Nothing, nothing.
[126:30.23]15, you're going to bust.
[126:31.37]Oh, yeah.
[126:32.41]Yeah, there it is.
[126:35.83]Yeah.

[126:36.63]Let's go.
[126:40.54]10.
[126:40.66]Give me an ace right now.
[126:41.28]Oh, we got money.
[126:42.98]Now I got 2,000 fun money.
[126:54.40]14 versus an ace.
[126:55.01]Oh, this is... It's over.
[126:57.41]Alright, that's not bad.
[126:58.29]Don't have a... I win.
[126:59.67]Again.
[126:59.93]Let's go.
[127:00.41]Alright, let's go.
[127:01.03]Come on.
[127:05.68]Last hand.
[127:08.24]Bingo.
[127:08.56]This is it.
[127:09.46]Give me 10.
[127:10.38]Oh!
[127:11.66]Oh!
[127:15.67]You piece of shit.
[127:27.47]Here's the money I owe you.
[127:31.13]Wonderful.
[127:31.55]Come back soon.
[127:33.95]Oh, he moves out of the way.
[127:34.73]Okay.
[127:35.01]I still have money, right?
[127:35.73]17 versus 2.
[127:41.71]Fuck.
[127:42.29]I'm staying.
[127:43.69]Lost.
[127:45.58]This is that last one.
[127:53.84]Blackjack!
[127:54.26]Oh!
[127:56.46]Yes!
[127:57.66]There it is.
[128:00.02]$20,000.
[128:00.04]Goodbye.
[128:00.70]I already paid it.
[128:17.71]Did I pay him twice?
[128:18.53]I didn't pay him twice, right?
[128:22.76]I just paid him twice.
[128:23.84]What the hell?
[128:24.56]No.
[128:24.62]What?
[128:25.06]What?
[128:33.83]Oh!
[128:34.15]It's alright.
[128:34.43]Whatever.
[128:34.67]I don't care.
[128:35.17]I paid him.
[128:44.10]I paid him.
[128:44.60]I paid him twice.
[128:45.24]That was stupid.
[128:45.68]And I wanted to get that money back.
[128:49.36]Use the telephone.
[129:00.59]Call Bear?
[129:01.45]What a kid.
[129:16.08]What?
[129:17.36]What's your emergency?
[129:18.30]Something's wrong.
[129:18.84]I'm sorry.
[129:19.16]There's an emergency.
[129:19.72]I'm playing an adventure game and I thought it'd be clever.
[129:21.38]I appreciate your honesty.
[129:25.44]Have a nice day.
[129:30.86]The door is locked.
[129:32.86]Use keypad?
[129:36.91]Wait, do I know what this is?
[129:39.31]Okay.
[129:44.43]I don't know what the code is though.
[129:55.18]What's on TV, Grandpa?
[129:56.38]The TV's not on.
[129:57.90]There's nothing to look at.
[129:58.68]I just realized I don't even touch my nose when I say that.
[130:10.09]Easy.
[130:28.57]Get out of the way, you little prick.
[130:32.23]You're blocking the TV.
[130:35.01]Grandpa, I thought you were dead.
[130:37.11]I am dead.
[130:38.47]So what?
[130:39.63]You're acting like you've never seen a ghost before.
[130:42.16]Now move so I can watch myself.
[130:46.52]What's the afterlife like?
[130:50.26]Yeah, it's not so bad.
[130:51.20]I need to crawl my way out of the hell.
[130:53.54]But at least that's what's easier than working this damn remote.
[130:58.30]Oh, right.
[130:58.78]Uncle Ted sends his love, too.
[131:00.29]Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.
[131:06.11]I present to you, made with me and my wife.
[131:20.77]What the hell's going on on this TV?
[131:22.49]Oh, Steakums!
[131:22.97]How do I get those?
[131:24.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[131:26.19]Oh, shit.
[131:27.69]Steak.
[131:28.23]Fuck.
[131:28.69]Whatever.
[131:29.15]I don't care.

[131:31.99]Ooh, shit.

[132:56.86]Here's another thousand bits.
[132:57.82]Thank you.
[133:05.94]I'm going to bust.
[133:07.52]Okay.
[133:07.94]Let's see.
[133:08.46]Exactly.
[133:08.76]We're good.
[133:13.08]Blackjack.
[133:14.06]17 versus 5.
[133:14.66]No.
[133:14.94]Don't do anything.
[133:15.62]Ever.
[133:16.88]No!
[133:17.06]I hit the wrong button!
[133:17.76]I hit the wrong button!
[133:18.24]I hit the wrong button.
[133:18.70]I actually hit the wrong button.
[133:19.96]I thought stand was on the left.
[133:21.58]Oh my god.
[133:22.44]What the?
[133:22.91]That was stupid.
[133:23.39]I thought that was stand.
[133:24.75]Give me more money.
[133:29.45]This is ridiculous.
[133:30.13]How many more times are you going to lose all your money?
[133:32.11]Well, I paid you twice, so technically this is my money.
[133:35.75]I gave you an extra $5,000.
[133:36.95]So you actually owe me $3,000 more.
[133:41.43]So that's how this is going to work.
[133:46.26]12 versus 3, shit.
[133:48.08]Oh my god.
[133:48.90]Fucking whatever.
[133:52.50]Give me the money you owe me.
[133:53.16]You owe me 3,000 more dollars.
[133:54.12]Give it to me.
[133:59.37]You must be the unluckiest man in Las Vegas.
[134:01.33]Take the money.
[134:01.85]Lose it all.
[134:02.33]I don't care.
[134:08.69]This sucks.
[134:09.41]I hate this.
[134:10.97]Oh my god.
[134:11.73]Give me a fucking break.
[134:17.07]He still owes me two grand.
[134:18.49]I'm gonna get it.
[134:22.81]That is just not going all in.
[134:24.83]You're going to run me out of business.
[134:26.69]You owe me another thousand dollars.
[134:30.53]There it is.
[134:31.05]Alright.
[134:31.35]Nobody move.
[134:34.72]Oh my fucking god.
[134:36.08]Okay.
[134:36.76]I blame this on the fact that I gave him five extra thousand more dollars and I accidentally hit when I had a guaranteed win.
[134:47.79]I feel like I've already given you more than 5,000 bits you owe me.
[134:50.23]Just take it.
[134:56.28]19.
[134:56.32]There it is.
[134:57.08]Come on.
[134:57.50]Don't accidentally do anything stupid.
[134:59.06]18.
[134:59.08]Give me it.
[135:00.76]Good.
[135:01.58]Again.
[135:01.82]Again.
[135:06.25]There it is.
[135:06.63]The 20.
[135:07.19]Versus the 19.
[135:08.49]Stay.
[135:09.39]Whatever.
[135:10.41]Whatever.
[135:11.15]You keep getting aces.
[135:11.87]That's stupid.
[135:16.70]20 again.
[135:17.24]Stay.
[135:17.80]Don't move.
[135:19.16]You're not gonna get any.
[135:19.82]You're not gonna get shit.
[135:20.36]You're gonna get 18.
[135:20.90]That's the win.
[135:21.42]Alright.
[135:21.62]Here we go.
[135:24.01]Last one.
[135:24.61]All in.
[135:24.93]4,000 hand.
[135:25.69]Let's go.
[135:27.21]Here's your 10.
[135:28.41]Here comes your 10.
[135:29.53]Again.
[135:29.77]18.
[135:30.01]I'll take it.
[135:30.81]Stay against 2.
[135:31.27]Thank you so much.
[135:32.39]I'll take that money.
[135:33.31]I'll take it.
[135:33.73]We're gonna do one more.
[135:34.49]We're gonna do one more at
[135:42.74]Thank you very much.
[135:43.88]That's it.
[135:44.28]This could be a push because it's probably a 10 under there.
[135:47.20]It's not.
[135:48.34]There's $12,000.
[135:48.84]Thank you so much.
[135:49.78]We're going to do one more at 2.
[135:55.13]Which gets us 16 versus 6.
[135:56.25]Don't do anything.
[135:57.97]Don't listen to people in the chat that say to do something.
[136:01.65]I don't care if I lost.
[136:02.87]That's how you play that hand.
[136:04.59]That's how you play that hand.
[136:05.63]Fuck it.
[136:10.71]No!
[136:11.01]No!
[136:30.56]Oh, I gotta check my mailbox.
[136:34.05]No insurance?
[136:34.67]Don't ever do insurance.
[136:38.87]Don't do insurance.
[136:39.51]Are we gonna go outside?
[136:49.69]Mailbox.
[136:51.33]Wow, the package for steak from Meat Yums is here already.
[136:56.26]That was speedy.
[137:02.37]Definitely been in there for too long.
[137:03.79]Okay, now I just need... What do I need?
[137:16.29]Mayo.
[137:16.75]Right, okay.
[137:18.56]Get this in here.
[137:27.48]I gotta do the maze?
[137:29.28]Let me get this in here first.
[137:32.11]Was there something else I could do over here?
[137:33.19]I feel like there was.
[137:33.76]Okay, there's the phone.
[137:43.08]I need the keypad to get in this door.
[137:46.03]Oh, grandpa.
[137:46.53]Right, let me talk to grandpa.
[137:47.21]Wait, there's another hallway.
[137:50.89]What else is down here?
[137:54.98]Framed picture.
[137:57.02]The Jerma is a river in southeastern Serbia and western Bulgaria.
[138:01.61]It is notable for passing the Serbian-Bulgarian border twice.
[138:05.89]The Jerma originates in the undeveloped and sparsely populated area of Krajiste in the southeastern corner of Serbia.
[138:15.79]Starting from the area between the artificial lake Vlasina and the Bulgarian border, it flows to the northwest on the eastern slopes of the Gromada Mountain, passing through the village of Klesura, after which it enters an arid region stretching over the border into Bulgaria.
[138:31.68]This is where the Jerma crosses the border for the first time, and at the border crossing of Strasimrivochi.
[138:38.78]Okay.
[138:42.34]Athrun.
[138:45.06]Air dryer?
[138:46.74]Now thanks, my hair is already dry.
[138:47.96]Okay.
[138:53.70]Can I use the toilet?
[139:01.32]Alright, computer number two.
[139:02.56]This is my number two com- I mean my second computer that I use for business reasons.
[139:13.60]Okay, anything else I can do?
[139:14.60]Nothing on the ground or anything?
[139:16.32]I feel like I'm gonna need this.
[139:17.23]My hair's already dry.
[139:19.31]Alright, well, I'll probably have to come back here later.
[139:20.83]Okay, the mirror?
[139:26.34]There is... Alright, that is funny.
[139:27.82]Okay.
[139:30.54]Basement.
[139:42.83]This is kind of creepy.
[139:46.98]Shit, hold on.
[139:48.22]Hold on, hold on a second.
[139:51.42]Hold on.
[139:56.74]I gotta get this right.
[139:58.28]Give me one second.
[140:00.16]Give me just one quick second here.
[140:02.60]I'm going to make it, uh, you know, okay.
[140:07.97]Oh, yes.
[140:10.19]Okay.
[140:11.19]Oh, would you look at that?
[140:12.41]Oh, it's my good friend, Jerma985.
[140:16.41]He's a wonderful, wonderful man from what I've seen.
[140:20.30]Okay.
[140:30.04]What are you doing down in my basement?
[140:32.98]What does it look like?
[140:35.09]On your own business.
[140:40.45]What are you doing down here?
[140:43.79]What do I do?
[140:48.27]Hot roast?
[140:50.41]I don't think this works with that.
[140:51.61]Banana peel?
[141:02.19]Okay, wait turn off the light I gotta bring obviously have to bring Bugleberry something Banana on the rumor.
[141:16.16]Yeah, I was thinking that too But maybe grandpa has something let's see How did you die?
[141:30.22]What?
[141:30.46]You don't remember?
[141:31.08]I suppose it was a few years ago.
[141:34.08]As I remember, Demon Lord Zoraxos chokeslammed me into hell, completely obliterating my spinal cord.
[141:39.91]Can't live without a spinal cord, son.
[141:42.01]Nothing unnatural about that.
[141:43.37]Yeah, I suppose you're right.
[141:46.81]What are you watching?
[141:49.51]There's nothing good on TV anymore, except for that steak yum commercial.
[141:52.91]It's got a good jingle.
[141:56.40]What's the afterlife like?
[141:58.50]It's not so bad.
[141:59.26]I already told you this.
[142:01.00]I told you already everything that you just wanted to know.
[142:05.48]You want a pot roast?
[142:09.25]I don't think that works.
[142:17.89]Put the hair dryer in the tub.
[142:21.44]What?
[142:21.62]Are you telling me to like kill Bugleberry?
[142:25.76]What's wrong with you?
[142:35.32]Here's a tip I use all the time back in my chocolate making days.
[142:38.70]If you ever make money, save.
[142:40.22]If you ever lose money, load an old save.
[142:42.24]Infinite money glitch.
[142:44.52]Thanks.
[142:48.93]Oh, this is, I hate when you, something like this versus a 3.
[142:51.13]Because you can make so many things with a 3, but I can't make very much anything with a 16.
[142:56.84]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stay.
[142:59.06]He's gonna bust right here.
[143:00.14]Yeah, that sucks.

[145:49.57]Bunker door.
[145:51.79]Looks like an old nuclear fallout bunker.
[145:59.96]Generator.
[146:01.18]Lots of fumes coming out of this one.
[146:06.92]Wall dad.
[146:10.20]Looks like a construction worker.
[146:11.56]How long has he been in my walls?
[146:13.14]My name is Jeremy.
[146:15.42]Who's Jason?
[146:19.74]What are you doing in my wall?
[146:27.42]My son Jason, he was supposed to bring me my pot roast for dinner ages ago.
[146:32.42]Well, I guess it's canceled because I can't get that kind of food, so I'll have canned beans instead.
[146:38.33]Do you know how to turn the internet back on?
[146:47.33]Well, sure I do.
[146:48.17]I did all the wiring around the house.
[146:50.43]I would help you, but I'm just so hungry thinking about that pot roast.
[146:54.07]I simply could not lift a finger until I've eaten.
[146:58.13]It's not very helpful.
[147:00.99]You know where Otto is?
[147:01.89]Otto?
[147:05.11]Is that one of Jason's friends?
[147:07.09]I haven't seen him around.
[147:09.78]No, never mind.
[147:11.50]Okay.
[147:11.60]How long have you been in here for?
[147:15.66]It's hard to tell.
[147:16.40]Days turn into months in here.
[147:18.30]Fumes from that generator sure don't help.
[147:21.12]Oh, well, it's a living.
[147:21.94]You make money being in here?
[147:24.74]Not really.
[147:25.40]Just an expression.
[147:28.76]There you go.
[147:30.02]Whoa, pot roast.
[147:30.90]No way.
[147:36.23]Oh, I don't feel so good.
[147:38.41]I was going to help you with the internet, but here, take the screwdriver.
[147:42.61]Just open the electrical box on the telephone pole outside.
[147:44.93]I'm going to lay you down for a while.
[147:50.92]Nice.
[147:52.60]Very nice.
[147:53.20]I'm going to get going.
[147:58.54]Pretty good setup you got down here.
[147:59.59]Don't touch that.
[148:03.21]Okay.
[148:03.43]Ooh, I got to skip.
[148:04.27]Now let's go to the internet.
[148:26.05]It's the hearthstone noise.
[148:28.19]Nobody touch that.
[148:34.25]And then we'll come down to the banana peel on the road.
[148:37.45]Hey, Mike Toyota.
[148:38.51]Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[148:39.83]Appreciate it.
[148:40.21]20 subs.
[148:41.47]There's been like three or four of those.
[148:49.72]Open sesame.
[148:52.86]Oh, God.
[148:53.44]Okay.
[148:54.14]Um...
[148:57.54]What am I supposed to do?
[149:09.41]Oh, that was easy.
[149:20.24]QTE of the day brought to you by... I mean, no, QTE has nothing to do with this.
[149:24.95]This has nothing to do with this.
[149:27.41]Okay, so did I get the internet back on?
[149:36.60]Alright, internet sorted.
[149:38.28]No problem.
[149:44.72]Very cool.
[149:45.16]Alright, let's do this.
[149:45.80]See if this works.
[150:00.66]I think I just killed somebody.
[150:02.88]An O from Otto.
[150:06.30]Note to self.
[150:07.58]Not a good lead.
[150:08.82]Why would the rumor know anything anyways?
[150:10.86]He's never even seen the cookies.
[150:13.13]I should talk to Jax.
[150:14.53]I saw him snooping around the other day looking for a snack.
[150:17.13]The code to his room is Omega L-U-L.
[150:27.68]Okay, Omega L-U-L.
[150:28.90]Let's pretend like this didn't happen.
[150:34.14]Alright.
[150:36.38]Uh, Omega L-U-L.
[150:40.84]That's on this door down here.
[150:47.93]Wait, I can use the freezer.
[150:48.93]Frozen cheese.
[150:53.89]Wait, I can get the key here.
[150:58.66]How is the rat going to smell the cheese if it's frozen?
[151:00.66]I have to cook it.
[151:02.21]Cheese in the oven?
[151:05.13]There's no way I'm opening that again.
[151:06.85]Cheese in the microwave?
[151:13.37]Oh, yep.
[151:14.07]Hair dryer.
[151:14.51]Okay, Omega.
[151:23.10]L-U-L.
[151:27.57]What was it?
[151:27.95]It's L-U-L.
[151:28.79]What is L?
[151:32.43]Which one of these is L?
[151:37.00]Omega?
[151:39.22]What's with U?
[151:39.74]What's U?
[151:45.04]L?
[151:50.12]U-L.
[151:51.42]Got it.
[151:51.64]Okay.
[151:54.59]That's what the Omega symbol is.
[151:55.97]Yeah, I know what it is.
[152:02.50]Oh, this is, oh, the old room.
[152:05.92]Oh, okay.
[152:13.27]Hey, sorry for interrupting.
[152:14.19]Have you seen Otto?
[152:15.31]A note of his said he was going to talk to you.
[152:19.57]Otto?
[152:20.51]Yeah, oh yeah, right.
[152:22.27]He was in here a little while ago asking me about cookies.
[152:25.15]He left this note here, but I'm way too busy to reach into my pocket and fish it out.
[152:30.93]If I beat your high score, would you put down the light gun for one second?
[152:34.64]You?
[152:35.04]Beating my high score?
[152:36.08]Didn't you die to Pinwheel?
[152:38.96]You can try, I guess.
[152:41.60]I also beat Dark Souls on stream, you know.
[152:47.74]You gonna let me play?
[152:50.11]Sure, stop whining.
[152:52.27]Mad Dog's Bottle Busters.
[152:55.09]Okay.
[152:55.27]Let's see what kind of a shot you are, pilgrim.
[152:58.57]Take it.
[153:01.33]I thought I just killed him.
[153:04.65]Where is it?
[153:06.85]Where is it?
[153:08.34]What's the high score?
[153:32.12]I don't have ammo.
[153:39.27]That's probably a thousand points, right?
[153:41.33]Ten thousand points?
[153:41.99]Damn it!
[153:44.13]I got it.
[153:44.85]That's definitely a thousand.
[154:04.02]1200.
[154:04.06]Is that enough?
[154:08.48]Nice.
[154:08.66]You don't have to hit all of them.
[154:15.49]Wait, you actually did it?
[154:17.25]Beat my high score?
[154:19.77]That's right, the god gamer himself in the flesh.
[154:21.41]Now, where's that note from Otto?
[154:23.56]Alright, sorry.
[154:24.12]I'm still in shock here.
[154:25.34]Here you go, take it.
[154:27.68]The cookie trail has gone cold.
[154:29.82]Jack doesn't know where the cookies are, and I'm beginning to lose hope that I'll ever find the cookies.
[154:35.34]The only clue I have left is the trail of water I found leading to the basement.
[154:41.69]Time to pay a visit to B.F. Bugleberry.
[154:44.07]See what he can tell us.
[154:50.67]Oh, you can just play.
[154:51.31]This is cool.
[154:59.21]Okay.
[155:00.01]Down to the basement.
[155:00.59]Maybe we'll have new dialog with, uh, Butelberry?
[155:03.49]Wait.
[155:08.47]Let's do this.
[155:16.84]Very cool.
[155:20.00]Mmm, ooey gooey cheese.
[155:25.68]Let's do the rat thing first, because I feel like I'm gonna need a key.
[155:38.54]Into the kitchen.
[155:39.06]Okay.
[155:43.04]Here's the cheese.
[155:48.91]Thank you.
[155:55.11]I'm going to assume I can open this door now.
[155:57.83]It's the only lock in the whole house.
[156:01.69]Huh?
[156:05.13]Oh, shit.
[156:05.84]I can make the sandwich.
[156:10.60]alright let's get the sandwich made perfect now time to turn it into turn it on and get cooking make the perfect sandwich
[156:36.39]Very good.
[156:37.39]Perfect.
[156:37.73]I was starving.
[156:38.79]Feels like I haven't eaten anything all day.
[156:41.37]Well, you know what I mean.
[156:42.05]Alright, now we have to go find Otto.
[156:47.63]Close the fridge?
[156:48.69]I just did.
[156:51.76]Go to the basement, talk to Bugleberry.
[156:53.18]Basement's all the way over here, right?
[157:01.84]Yeah.
[157:07.81]Oh, gamble?
[157:08.45]No, I don't need to.
[157:09.53]Okay.
[157:18.39]Oh, God.
[157:25.00]Otto said you'd be down here.
[157:26.08]Do you know where the cookies went?
[157:28.80]Cookies?
[157:30.38]Ah, yes.
[157:31.82]I've been using the cookies as ingredients in my cauldron.
[157:37.21]I have one left.
[157:41.47]I'm guessing you need me to solve some convoluted puzzle for you.
[157:45.63]How did you know?
[157:46.31]I've been trying to follow the recipe for the perfect Jerma character, but the page in my book has been ripped to pieces.
[157:56.32]If you can recreate the recipe for me, I'll give you the last cookie.
[157:59.84]I will.
[158:03.64]Take a look at that recipe.
[158:07.69]Okay, in this order, these symbols in this order.
[158:12.43]This is probably, is this important too?
[158:16.69]Is this the Greek alphabet?
[158:17.55]Okay.
[158:22.98]Oh shit, hold on, what was it?
[158:28.08]No, no, no, no, no, I, hold on.
[158:41.92]I just want to see what happens.
[158:51.67]Jeremy Jermstar.
[158:57.21]Alright.
[158:59.79]That was an interesting one.
[159:01.61]It's not the one we're looking for.
[159:02.95]I want to do that again.
[159:06.13]Alright, we're going to do blue and green.
[159:12.40]Blue, blue, green, green, and then red.
[159:16.14]Oh, no, purple.
[159:28.47]And... New Year's, Jerma.
[159:35.72]It's a gotcha game.
[159:38.84]Well, that was an interesting one, but it's not the one we're looking for.
[159:45.53]Alright, what's the actual one?
[159:47.99]Let me see the recipe.
[159:49.11]Okay.
[159:51.97]Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle.
[159:55.47]In those color orders.
[159:57.65]Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle.
[160:00.67]Red, green, I gotta write this down.
[160:08.47]Did I even tweet this stream out?
[160:11.93]Don't write it down?
[160:13.07]How am I gonna remember this?
[160:14.41]Circle...
[160:16.06]Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle.
[160:20.02]Red, green, purple, blue, yellow.
[160:22.61]Red, green, purple.
[160:24.05]Red, green, purple.
[160:25.05]Red, green, purple.
[160:26.47]Circle.
[160:28.03]Red, circle.
[160:30.49]There's no red circle.
[160:33.79]There's no red circle.
[160:34.97]Where is it?
[160:43.33]circle square triangle star triangle in this order oh it doesn't okay so I just have to do circle these are the symbols so what's what's not on here circle square triangle star no hearts no hearts at all I get it
[161:12.66]Okay.
[161:13.50]So we need to do red, green.
[161:16.34]Red, green, purple, blue, yellow.
[161:18.14]Red, green, purple, blue, yellow.
[161:20.64]Red.
[161:23.84]Green.
[161:25.40]I have to write it down.
[161:31.95]Purple, blue, yellow.
[161:40.99]I think I got it.
[161:43.87]I'm just gonna write it down.
[161:44.85]Why would I... You write shit down in these games.
[161:48.23]Just gonna write it down.
[161:48.81]Whatever.
[161:49.05]Fuck it.
[161:49.85]I'm writing it down.
[161:56.02]I'm writing it down.
[161:56.66]I'm gonna write it down.
[161:58.86]Okay.
[161:59.04]Why are there two triangles up there?
[162:05.52]Oh, I have to use two triangles.
[162:08.75]I'm writing it down.
[162:17.90]Did I read this?
[162:19.08]I read this, right?
[162:19.78]Met a couple at a random restaurant who told me about a wrestler dying.
[162:23.15]I don't know them and don't know the wrestler.
[162:25.81]I was in a city I do not know at all.
[162:27.45]I may have been visiting.
[162:28.73]I was invited to his funeral and was trying to be polite and said yes.
[162:33.14]A couple then sent me a referral link to a weird online system to accept the invite slash make payments.
[162:40.19]I ignored it and went back to my room.
[162:43.97]I got ready to go, was in a full suit, and took a car a few miles away to the spot I met the couple.
[162:49.69]I had the address written down for the funeral, but left it in my room.
[162:54.33]For some reason, I figured it was right across the street from the restaurant we met.
[162:58.75]I couldn't find it.
[162:59.89]I looked everywhere.
[163:01.23]After an hour or so, I went back to my room and said, fuck it.
[163:05.00]After a while, I got a phone call from the couple who asked if I was still going.
[163:09.46]The funeral was well underway and I didn't want to just walk in at the end.
[163:13.56]They gave me the address and it was a 50 minute drive from my room.
[163:18.45]They started having bad reception and told me to sign up for their referral link again before I hung up.
[163:24.54]It was a dream I had.
[163:25.32]Did I tell you guys that one?
[163:34.82]Did I go over that one before?
[163:36.22]No?
[163:36.88]I wrote it down.
[163:42.04]That's when I woke up.
[163:43.36]What was I doing?
[163:44.68]Oh, right.
[163:45.06]I was writing this down.
[163:50.69]Why did he read it like he's never seen it?
[163:53.41]I mean, I have seen it before.
[163:55.05]It's been a while.
[163:57.39]That was December of 2020.
[164:00.01]That's when I had that dream.
[164:01.83]Okay.
[164:03.36]Let's keep going.
[164:03.76]What was I writing this down?
[164:04.84]Notes.
[164:05.28]New note.
[164:06.86]Okay.
[164:07.22]Circle.
[164:10.54]Square.
[164:12.86]Triangle.
[164:16.30]R. Triangle.
[164:19.08]The order is red.
[164:21.70]Green.
[164:23.50]Purple.
[164:26.33]Blue.
[164:29.71]Yellow.
[164:30.55]Alright, let's do it.
[164:35.49]Okay.
[164:36.47]So circle.
[164:37.99]I need red.
[164:38.65]A red square.
[164:40.69]There's no red circle, so we're gonna do red square.
[164:51.77]Green.
[164:53.99]Square?
[164:54.33]No.
[164:56.01]Green triangle.
[164:57.50]Thank you.
[165:02.86]And then we need to do purple.
[165:07.58]Purple circle.
[165:16.07]And then blue star.
[165:20.21]Yellow triangle.
[165:22.25]Oh, fuck.
[165:22.95]What happened?
[165:25.99]Yellow circle?
[165:26.65]It said there was two triangles.
[165:30.03]There's only one.
[165:30.51]It's orange.
[165:32.01]Isn't that orange?
[165:37.60]Just use the triangle.
[165:46.12]Catboy!
[165:46.68]Is that the one?
[165:54.15]That's it.
[165:55.23]My finest creation yet.
[165:57.47]Chad is going to love this.
[165:59.39]Just think of all the fan art.
[166:01.41]As promised, here is the last cookie.
[166:05.41]No need to throw.
[166:07.00]I wouldn't if I were you.
[166:14.04]I should take this back to Otto's bed.
[166:15.48]He can smell cookies from a mile away.
[166:24.18]Off-brand Bugleberry.
[166:26.44]That's... No.
[166:29.12]I... Whatever.
[166:29.62]Alright, let's go see if we can find him.
[167:03.97]Somebody said, Jesus Christ, you're... It's not a real... It's not real money.
[167:08.20]I'm not... It's not real... My bank account's not linked to the game.
[167:14.82]Okay, here we go.
[167:23.51]Did we do it?
[167:24.67]Otto!
[167:27.31]It's Otto the Wonder Dog.
[167:29.54]Ready for your walk?
[167:37.37]That was a great walk.
[167:38.83]Hey, where'd Otto go?
[167:46.23]Where is he?
[167:46.65]Is there another note?
[167:49.65]Hmm, no.
[167:57.19]Backyard?
[168:02.72]Was there chocolate on that?
[168:06.70]What's the thing that... What is it?
[168:09.60]There's something that is like chocolate, but it's not chocolate.
[168:12.12]What's it called?
[168:12.56]Carob.
[168:15.06]Yeah.
[168:17.05]Carob.
[168:18.69]Where's Otto?
[168:37.40]This had to have been finished very recently.
[168:40.22]Right?
[168:40.44]Because this was only like a month or two ago.
[168:43.62]This was a couple months ago.
[168:47.33]To be able to add all this.
[168:49.13]All the dollhouse references.
[168:50.85]That would have been pretty late in development.
[168:54.65]Where's Otto?
[169:04.60]Who's a good boy?
[169:06.70]Otto.
[169:11.27]Aw, that's so cute.
[169:13.83]Is it time to stream?
[169:14.61]Let's see.
[169:14.99]Uh, I got an achievement that just said -2 worst stream of the year.
[169:22.59]Hey, man.
[169:23.73]Welcome to the stream.
[169:24.95]My name's Jerma.
[169:25.83]Nice to meet you.
[169:26.49]Right there.
[169:26.89]Bingo.
[169:27.45]Right there.
[169:27.73]That's the follow button.
[169:28.59]If you click that, every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.
[169:32.83]And I do lots of fun things on this stream.
[169:35.77]Like, uh, playing Hitman.
[169:41.19]Blinking.
[169:43.89]I was just lost in my brain trying to find any game.
[169:46.59]You can just see the cogs turning to, like, just say any video game.
[169:54.19]I have no idea what was the last thing I played.
[170:06.53]And...
[170:09.45]That was really fun.
[170:10.57]Those two were really cool.
[170:13.84]Aimed by William Enders, aka 14 hour lunch break, aka dev in chat.
[170:20.40]All the art.
[170:21.98]Very good job.
[170:23.78]That was very cute.
[170:28.04]Additional 3D models.
[170:29.22]Look at that.
[170:29.52]Yeah, well done.
[170:36.38]That was really, that was really fun.
[170:38.69]Excellent, excellent work.
[170:40.55]Both of the development teams that made these games.
[170:46.40]Jeff McCloud.
[170:50.42]Jeff McCloud is just... He's the Picasso of royalty-free music.
[170:57.08]Special thanks.
[171:06.33]Jerma voice line Emporium.
[171:09.83]What?
[171:10.05]That exists?
[171:13.45]Very cool.
[171:15.15]Steam support team.
[171:16.13]I don't know.
[171:16.47]Was there an issue?
[171:17.09]I wonder.
[171:21.60]Hey!
[171:23.80]Well, thanks for making it.
[171:25.46]It's really fun.
[171:33.61]He doesn't know that there's a voice treasury of everything he's ever said.
[171:38.81]Well, whatever.
[171:41.05]No, don't do this.
[171:43.09]We have to do this every... Fine.
[171:47.55]Tricked you.
[171:48.15]It's Egypt and we're both Super Frog.
[171:50.33]How could you not like it?
[171:51.41]It's got candy.
[171:53.42]Yeah.
[171:54.34]Yeah.
[171:58.10]Ooh.
[171:58.74]Alright.
[171:59.30]We got our expectations subverted three times there.
[172:03.04]Very cool.
[172:08.12]Oh, I got an achievement.
[172:08.80]+2.
[172:12.46]If you're getting the Jerma Cough Emporium, the Jerma Sneeze Emporium, and the Jerma Yawn Emporium.
[172:18.53]Why?
[172:20.57]Why do you want all that?
[172:27.11]Why do you want a bunch of times that I've, like, coughed?
[172:34.81]That was really cool.
[172:36.68]I'm very happy with that.
[172:39.29]That was a lot of fun.
[172:44.59]So, now, uh, those are the two of the community games I wanted to play.
[172:51.76]What am I- don't- what?
[172:56.54]End of the stream, boys?
[172:58.70]Um, I've actually probably maybe, because I want to get back to, like, Saturday, Sunday.
[173:07.48]So, we're probably gonna just go Saturday, Sunday.
[173:10.98]To kind of get back to normal here.
[173:13.00]Three hour Andy.
[173:14.94]I did say it was only gonna be a three hour stream on Twitter.
[173:17.32]Did I even tweet that?
[173:18.14]No, I didn't.
[173:18.72]What?
[173:19.00]Am I misremembering that?
[173:22.38]I tweeted, right?
[173:24.42]What did I say in the tweet?
[173:27.20]Playing a couple fan games, hanging out for a few hours.
[173:29.22]Alright, I said that, yeah.
[173:32.86]Yeah, I want to do Saturday, Sunday.
[173:33.92]I want to get back to that.
[173:34.56]Because like I said, I don't want to be once a week anymore.
[173:37.68]I want to be like twice a week.
[173:40.08]So we can call it here.
[173:41.60]I'll be back on Saturday, Sunday for more longer, substantial streams.
[173:47.03]Not just three hours.
[173:51.65]A few is eight hours.
[173:55.53]I want to get in the habit of even if I'm not going to be around for that long, I still want to pop in for a few hours, like at least two times a week.
[174:03.33]I'm slowly trying to get back to not doing once a week anymore.
[174:09.33]And we'll see going forward.
[174:11.05]I'm going to keep trying to add them as I can.
[174:14.68]And I will see you guys on Saturday.
[174:19.67]We'll do Saturday, Sunday.
[174:20.69]I have plans, if you don't know what the Halloween plan is, although that's next weekend.
[174:24.21]We're going to be watching a bunch of public domain movies on Halloween, like we did last time.
[174:30.85]That was one of the funnest streams ever.
[174:33.17]Hopefully we have a good time again.
[174:34.27]We're going to watch at least three or four plus hours, even more, maybe five plus hours of old shitty movies.
[174:42.64]See if we can find some.
[174:43.84]And by the way, there's a possibility we might see the Ritz Brothers return.
[174:47.94]I think they have another one or two that we could watch.
[174:53.58]But to the people that made... And there's other community games too that exist.
[174:58.30]I know.
[175:00.13]During the community content nights, I know a couple of them came in.
[175:04.01]So this is fun to do.
[175:05.83]I like to compile them every now and then.
[175:09.64]But
[175:11.03]Really, really good job.
[175:11.85]This is really fun.
[175:12.67]It's shocking to me that somebody wants to put the amount of time that it takes to make something like this just for fun and just to maybe have people play it and enjoy it and be connected to this community and this stream and everything.
[175:26.09]It's mind-blowing.
[175:27.15]So I hope it was fun to work on.
[175:29.65]It was really fun to play.
[175:34.78]But that's going to be the end of the stream.
[175:37.12]I will see you guys on Saturday, Sunday.
[175:38.36]We will get back to normal on the Saturday, Sunday weekend Andy schedule.
[175:47.28]Let's do a raid.
[175:47.94]We raid, raid, raid Nianers.
[175:50.10]Yeah, sure.
[175:54.86]Yeah, let's go.
[175:55.26]We haven't raided somebody in a while.
[176:00.10]What is Nianers playing?
[176:00.84]Minecraft?
[176:13.51]I've heard a raid song.
[176:14.75]No, no more.
[176:15.43]Hey, nobody wants to do the raid song.
[176:17.93]Nobody wants to do the raid song.
[176:19.35]The raid song was not, I'm telling you right now, as comedy professor, your comedy professor, we talked about it like two or three hours ago.
[176:27.97]That, that's not, yeah, that gets you removed from the class.
[176:32.62]By the way, I want to make this clear too.
[176:34.70]If somebody farts into a baked Lay's bag and you come in the next day and fart into a baked Lay's bag, I'm going to send you home.
[176:41.39]Right?
[176:42.81]We can't have like 30 people all fart into a baked Lay's bag at the same time the next day.
[176:47.58]Right?
[176:48.24]That person got an A. You got to do something else.
[176:52.06]And there's people that probably just came in like 20 minutes ago.
[176:53.74]They have no idea what we're talking about.
[176:54.70]It's fine.
[176:55.14]It's fine.
[176:57.66]Go say hello to Nieners.
[177:00.36]I will talk to you guys on Saturday.
[177:02.72]Have a great one.
[177:03.46]We will do some longer streams on Saturday, Sunday.
[177:06.42]I have a lot of things I want to prepare.
[177:09.02]Thanks for watching, as always.
[177:09.90]The community shit is awesome.
[177:11.44]I love to do it.
[177:12.19]I wish we could still do the community video stuff, but I can't play eight minutes uninterrupted of Star Wars.
[177:18.73]That would get me removed, I believe, from the platform.
[177:21.61]So we can't do those anymore.
[177:25.70]I'm surprised we got away with it as long as we did, if I'm very honest with you.
[177:31.99]So, uh, unfortunately, but if we can do stuff like this, I'd love to do it, so.
[177:37.81]Have a great rest of your night.
[177:38.91]Thanks for hanging out for the few hours that we were here.
[177:41.33]See you Saturday at 2 p.m.
[177:43.72]Pacific.
[177:45.48]Good night.
[177:46.22]Goodbye.
[177:46.56]See you soon.
[178:03.74]Oh my god, wait, I didn't even do the outro.
[178:05.46]What the fuck?
[178:06.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's too fast.
[178:08.94]Oh, I thought it was ending right now.
[178:13.30]Okay, I thought it was actually like you were getting sent in now.
[178:20.60]I just fucking panicked.
[178:22.34]I wanted to do the subs too.
[178:23.58]I just was queuing up the raid.
[178:27.28]That was actual panic.
[178:28.48]Oh my god.
[178:29.50]That scared the shit out of me for some reason.
[178:31.63]I saw the bar on my screen was going in five seconds.
[178:34.73]I'm sorry.
[178:36.89]Oh shit.
[178:37.47]I'm going to have to cancel this.
[178:40.09]Can we get through the subs?
[178:41.21]I can't believe there's this many people that still sub to the channel.
[178:44.04]This is insane.
[178:47.16]We're not even going to get through the D's by the time the raid happens.
[178:55.49]We're only in the Ds.
[178:56.57]We're in the Gs.
[178:57.33]I have to cancel the raid.
[178:59.11]I have to cancel it.
[179:00.35]We'll do it again in a second.
[179:01.31]Just wait.
[179:04.09]Yeah, I'm canceling the raid.
[179:04.93]We have to do it again in a second.
[179:05.77]I'm sorry.
[179:09.07]Wait.
[179:09.47]Somebody just gave subs and it superseded my ability to cancel the raid.
[179:14.16]I can't cancel the raid anymore.
[179:15.60]It's on... 8-bit just gave 10 community subs and I can't click any buttons now.
[179:20.80]It's taken over.
[179:21.66]You're just gonna go.
[179:22.92]I'm so sorry.
[179:25.68]Oh my god, I can't stop it.
