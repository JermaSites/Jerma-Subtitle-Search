[35:02.07]What the fuck are you talking about?
[35:03.19]I mean, just refresh.
[35:06.69]Is it an internet problem?
[35:07.57]We lost the internet.
[35:08.35]Is that what happened?
[35:11.17]So just get it back.
[35:13.53]Can you connect to another Twitch server?
[35:14.95]There's a guy on the channel right now.
[35:19.52]What do you mean there's a guy on the channel right now?
[35:24.06]What guy?
[35:26.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[35:29.04]Production in my ear right now, tell me what's happening because I don't understand.
[35:32.68]The stream got hacked?
[35:34.74]My stream got hacked?
[35:38.06]What?
[35:43.40]Okay.
[35:45.44]Should we do a different channel or what?
[35:47.87]What the fuck is going on?
[35:51.21]Shut the fuck up!
[35:59.16]Don't talk to me.
[35:59.64]Don't make eye contact with me.
[36:03.72]You know what?
[36:04.88]Let me, hold on.
[36:05.72]Show me what's going on.
[36:09.07]What's happening in here?
[36:09.97]Remember, there's a data breach right here.
[36:11.71]Remember the data breach?
[36:12.71]Well, someone accessed our stream key.
[36:16.19]How expensive were you two, right?
[36:19.09]Well, I see his name here.
[36:20.81]This is my channel right here.
[36:21.95]That's right.
[36:22.55]And what happened?
[36:25.26]It looks like there was a breach in the firewall.
[36:27.42]Oh, it looks like there was a breach in the firewall.
[36:31.35]What's your hourly rate, by the way?
[36:33.75]Yeah, don't want to say that, by the way.
[36:35.45]So you both have masters in technology.
[36:37.79]You can't fucking figure this out?
[36:39.07]Rewrite the source code.
[36:40.71]Go for it.
[36:41.21]Prescribe that source code over here, what he said.
[36:44.74]You understand how much money this cost?
[36:46.20]Did you understand how much time I spent doing this?
[36:50.22]Where's off-brand?
[36:52.22]Where the fuck is Ludwig?
[36:53.49]Where's Atrioc?
[36:54.23]Where the fuck are they?

[36:59.92]Hey, buddy, how are you?
[37:01.42]Fucking snake, motherfucker.
[37:03.38]Who leaked my stream key?
[37:04.72]I don't know.
[37:05.36]What's going on?
[37:06.04]What's going on?
[37:06.82]Somebody is live on my channel right now, and I'm sorry, but it's making me very upset, and you need to figure out how it happened.
[37:12.76]We'll figure it out.
[37:13.68]Jerma, we'll figure it out.
[37:15.20]You, if this is a problem, by the way, we are done.
[37:19.13]You and I are never talking ever again.
[37:20.35]By the way, this was made wrong.
[37:23.83]Jerma, dude.
[37:24.57]Don, I don't want to talk to you.
[37:25.55]Go clean that up.
[37:35.82]Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[37:39.72]Hey, okay, so what the heck is going on here?
[37:43.81]Hey, so are we live?
[37:46.25]Are we live on a different channel?
[37:48.71]Okay, alright.
[37:50.59]So what's happening here is, this is the elf puzzle room, by the way.
[37:54.29]Elf puzzle room.
[37:58.91]I don't know if we're even live yet.
[38:00.13]I don't know if we've even started yet.
[38:01.73]But if we can get the energy in the room, we can get higher!
[38:04.93]Yay!
[38:05.33]So we have a puzzle here that people are gonna be doing in this room, and it's gonna be... Puzzle!
[38:09.49]We love puzzles!
[38:14.35]Stand up.
[38:16.39]Get out.
[38:17.87]Get out.
[38:20.44]I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a dick about this, but you were told in the contract when you signed it to shut the fuck up when I came in the room, and that's fine.
[38:26.72]So we've got this 10,000 piece puzzle.
[38:29.76]We are actually live, good.
[38:31.22]So we've got this 10,000 piece puzzle, and it's gonna be done over the course of the evening.
[38:35.26]This is awesome, hooray!
[38:37.08]So you can get started here with this, and you can go for it, and hey, don't you think we should have a little bit of snow?
[38:44.87]Yeah, yes!
[38:48.62]Alright, so let's get it started here.
[38:50.62]Hey, Snoke, Snoke, Snoke, Snoke, Snoke, Snoke.
[38:56.37]Ow, ow.
[39:05.57]Ow.
[39:06.89]What the fuck did I have, Dad?
[43:08.56]So we confirm that the other channels, my channel's not working?
[43:12.81]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[43:22.51]I'm sorry, everybody, that this is happening.
[43:28.02]I just want to say that it's, you know, you got to do what you got to do, and we're doing this now.
[43:34.00]And it's time for us to just... Can somebody please get rid of the ASCII art in the chat that I see over here?
[43:43.75]All I see is ASCII.
[43:44.75]I just saw Forsen like a thousand times.
[43:47.21]What do you mean, like, Forsen?
[43:49.48]But there's a lot.
[43:50.08]We need to clean that up a little, I think.
[43:53.12]While we're here, we're live, we're good, hi, how are you?
[43:56.56]Can we potentially get some people to say, clap maybe in the back?
[44:01.10]Maybe we can just pretend like we're doing something good.
[44:07.52]Stop spamming the AcciArt!
[44:13.72]I've got an award show to do.
[44:16.39]Regardless of where we are, regardless of whose channel we're on,
[44:21.69]There, we have awards to do, and we have a lot of them, so we have to get started.
[44:26.59]I don't know what's going on over on the other channel.
[44:28.85]I don't know what happened, but we're working on it.
[44:30.45]We've got engineers, they're incredibly skilled.
[44:33.05]But we're gonna have to do the awards over here.
[44:36.39]So, we'll start.
[44:37.97]I gotta compose myself a little.
[44:40.23]I've got cocoa over here, and it was so freshly brewed, and everything just got ruined.
[44:46.11]It's okay.
[44:47.31]Is it alright?
[44:48.97]Well, what's he even doing on the other channel while we just do this?
[44:52.15]What's he doing on the other channel?
[44:58.90]What is he playing?
[44:59.64]Is he playing a game?
[45:02.78]Dude, you got no mods.
[45:04.98]Do you think I thought of that?
[45:06.70]Do you think that I thought of that before the channel got compromised and we're on a different channel?
[45:11.12]Do you think I thought of that?
[45:11.93]Are you stupid?
[45:16.74]Don't get mad at people in chat, there's no reason to.
[45:20.00]I'm gonna do my awards show the way that I'm supposed to, 27 categories, and we're gonna get started here.
[45:28.17]So let's just relax, can we reset?
[45:30.95]Let's reset.
[45:33.53]The first category is Best Bro, and what is Best Bro?
[45:39.51]Best bro is when I said, I don't know why this is even a category, but it's when I said bro a handful of times.
[45:47.47]So should be fun to see what those nominees are.
[45:50.28]Here are your nominees for best bro of the year.
[46:01.26]There's one place I didn't go.
[46:03.02]I need to go to the magic school.
[46:05.69]Where's the magic school?
[46:07.89]Bro.
[46:10.02]Bro, where's the magic school?
[46:11.88]No more of this.
[46:12.66]Bro!
[46:13.64]This is the thing you attach a trailer to a truck.
[46:18.16]That's not a woodcutter.
[46:21.20]What do you mean, look at it?
[46:22.32]I'm not looking at it.
[46:25.30]Bro.
[46:26.64]Fellas.
[46:27.48]Ladies and gentlemen.
[46:28.62]That is not a woodcutter.
[46:31.81]I'm pressing the buttons.
[46:34.19]What the fuck?
[46:36.85]I'm pressing down, it's just, he fucking hits a wall and freezes, bro.
[46:41.72]Bro, relax.
[46:45.06]Bro, where else am I supposed to put this?
[46:46.94]Why is this even a category, by the way?
[46:49.22]Bro.
[46:50.94]This was added last second.
[46:53.54]What a stupid category.
[46:57.96]Give me a break, man.
[46:58.84]Are you kidding me?
[47:00.14]Bro.
[47:00.84]Bro.
[47:00.92]Bro.
[47:20.02]Bro?
[47:21.34]But honestly, man, when somebody asks you, when somebody says, hey dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game?
[47:27.50]It's like, bro!
[47:29.50]Yes!
[47:33.08]Oh!
[47:38.35]Fuck you, bro.
[47:40.75]And... What the fuck?
[47:45.69]Bro!
[47:49.23]Okay, bro.
[47:51.07]What are you fucking doing?
[47:54.89]What the fuck are you talking about, bro?
[47:56.77]I was hitting X on the right spot!
[47:58.97]This is making me really mad.
[48:00.95]Bro, House Flipper is my number one most played game on stream.
[48:05.12]You don't think I know what I'm supposed... I'm just trying to do the missions quickly to be able to buy the house.
[48:10.66]Bro?
[48:13.14]Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, slow down.
[48:17.50]I just need to hit you with this.
[48:18.60]I got it!
[48:24.32]Somebody in the chat said, I just saw it, somebody in the chat said, hey, bro, can you play Call of Duty, bro?
[48:31.86]Right now, are you gonna say that?
[48:34.34]Right now?
[48:36.58]Anyways, your winner for best bro of the year is, let me get into it,
[48:49.87]I don't even know which one this is.
[48:52.98]Bro, are you kidding me with 26% of the vote?
[48:57.16]And did you know there's a dodge in this game for 24%?
[49:00.66]And then bro, it's not a woodcutter with 13.
[49:05.22]So bro, are you kidding me?
[49:06.38]I don't even know which one that is.
[49:10.37]But there you go, best bro.
[49:11.69]We're gonna do another one.
[49:13.83]This is worse, Peter, which also was actually supposed to be taken off the list.
[49:20.12]but I left it on accidentally and realized that it was still part of the categories before we removed it, so we're gonna keep it in.
[49:29.00]So, let's go ahead and see the nominees for Worst Beater.
[49:41.17]I'm over here, here, here.
[49:49.08]He's doing a joke.
[49:50.46]Reader.
[49:53.42]Reader.
[49:53.98]Reader.
[50:02.08]It was the chap, ah, ah, bitter.
[50:04.16]It was the chapstick bitter.
[50:06.02]We need a, we need a wow factor here.
[50:08.12]Okay.
[50:09.12]I'm gonna bring the, you know, I consider myself to be a dancer.
[50:15.38]A dancer?
[50:16.00]A dancer.
[50:16.96]Something of a dancer myself.
[50:18.94]A dancer.
[50:21.22]That's a bitter?
[50:22.24]That is a bitter.
[50:23.42]Rats.
[50:24.70]Rats.
[50:26.71]We have the rats.
[50:30.45]Stop saying Peter and help me with this fucking video game stop.
[50:37.33]It's half of the chat
[50:52.21]All I see is butt-crackin' Peter.
[50:55.21]Help me.
[50:59.25]What did he say?
[51:00.41]Wait, what did you say, Peter?
[51:01.42]Peter?
[51:01.78]I'm sorry, that's all I heard.
[51:02.78]Hey, uh, Peter.
[51:03.72]There, old pally.
[51:04.42]It's time for an old-fashioned handshake.
[51:07.40]The Last Supper.
[51:21.36]Yeah, remember when Jesus ate a bunch of fucking chili cheese Fritos with, like, Joseph and Peter?
[51:26.28]Remember when they had the hot tamales and, like, Jesus, like, Jesus, like, gave a hot tamale to Peter and he fucking, he didn't like it, he almost puke.
[51:36.62]Hello again, Peter.
[51:39.16]It's me, Saul.
[51:41.95]I knew we were friends for a reason, Craig.
[51:44.39]Yeah.
[51:45.36]We do Joe, we do Kermit.
[51:46.76]We can do just about everything.
[51:49.86]Where the hell is the Medicaid?
[51:50.96]Are you reading it over here?
[51:52.82]The amount of voices you can do?
[52:01.69]Worst category of the entire, the worst of the entire night.
[52:05.19]I don't know, people had to really search for that one.
[52:08.09]There's no way you even knew.
[52:09.59]Maybe some of you saved those clips from earlier.
[52:12.25]But ladies and gentlemen, your winner,
[52:15.33]for worst beer of the year is, I actually don't know this, so this is gonna be news to me too.
[52:23.26]You've Been Such a Good Boy, Peter, and then Ghost Peter, and then Infomercial Peter.
[52:29.98]By the way, You've Been Such a Good Boy, Peter won with 24.7% of the vote.
[52:34.43]So that's cool.
[52:35.99]Very interesting stuff.
[52:37.83]Moving right along, look at this one.
[52:43.41]We're getting through the real shit categories first.
[52:46.05]Let me be really clear with you.
[52:47.61]So going through the shit categories first, as the engineers are still working on the channel, best ooh, oh, ooh, and I'll give one to you right now.
[52:57.86]So here it is.
[52:58.26]Ooh, oh, ooh.
[53:01.92]I apparently do that quite often.
[53:04.16]I don't know how often because, why am I opening it now?
[53:06.50]We haven't even seen the nominees.
[53:09.62]Why would I do that without you seeing the nominees first?
[53:12.98]Anyways, here are your nominees for worst, no, it's best ooh of the year.
[53:27.89]That was a good one too.
[53:32.39]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[53:40.71]Is that a mask or does he actually have two heads?
[53:45.54]We got it!
[53:46.58]Alright, hello.
[53:47.58]I'm here.
[53:47.90]I'm here to get a rust repair kit.
[53:49.92]Ooh.
[54:18.99]Can I stand actually for a spell?
[54:20.79]Because if it is, I want to know what it is.
[54:24.95]Mud.
[54:28.88]I like this game.
[54:29.54]This is a fun game.
[54:34.52]Akano.
[54:35.62]Old Dark Matter himself.
[54:37.92]So I didn't even need to, whatever.
[54:40.98]Ooh.
[54:44.42]Get ready to nominate that one.
[54:56.12]Those were all bad.
[54:59.95]You know, before I open this, I want to say, I didn't think that there was even enough to vote for this year.
[55:07.10]I think I said that a few weeks ago.
[55:09.10]I was like, there's no way that I did this this many times.
[55:12.82]But apparently, I did it 1,000 times.
[55:15.83]We'll see who wins.
[55:16.71]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner for worst ooh, oh, ooh of the year is... With 35.8% of the vote, we got it from Saucery.
[55:30.94]And then get ready to nominate this one for 23% and then sorcery spell excitement.
[55:36.25]I mean, I said it like five times in a row.
[55:38.91]It was like If you don't know, by the way, there's probably people that have no idea what the hell that is.
[55:44.01]So that is a sound effect file from The Simpsons arcade game.
[55:49.09]The first boss of the game does that every time you hit him three or four times.
[55:52.18]So if you are understanding what that actually is from, it's from that game.
[55:59.25]And by the way, speaking of shit categories, by the way, I did talk to production earlier about, man, this category takes way too long.
[56:07.05]This is gonna take far too long.
[56:08.62]I don't even wanna, I was gonna remove it last second.
[56:11.66]I was gonna say, let's not do it because it's worse cat puke.
[56:15.54]And there's like 40, there's like 20 or 30 nominees.
[56:18.98]It's like an eight minute video.
[56:20.60]So are you ready to watch eight minutes or so of somebody cat puking?
[56:27.22]Alright, I guess so.
[56:30.91]There are no mods?
[56:33.46]There are mods!
[56:35.12]We modded random fucking people.
[56:37.90]So people say this is the best category.
[56:39.61]We'll find out.
[56:40.75]Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for Worst Cat Puke of the Year.
[56:53.09]I have this fear of, okay, a snake is just like, oh, you want to hold the snake?
[56:56.44]Yeah, sure.
[56:57.68]And then just kind of, it's wrapping around my arm and looking at me and going, it's like, oh, hey, hey, little guy.
[57:06.80]Like licking and like kind of looks cute.
[57:09.19]And then I move like a way that they don't like.
[57:11.95]And he, ah!
[57:16.99]And I'm like, and I start to fucking pass out and shit.
[57:18.81]Like, I don't know.
[57:19.41]They freak me out.
[57:20.59]That would be so scary.
[57:24.05]If you're just in like a pitch black area, and all you hear is this.
[57:33.32]Come on.
[57:37.50]Let me try that brew.
[57:41.66]You can just hear the crunch of the bread.
[57:47.86]Do you need a handsaw to cut through a piece of fucking bread?
[57:54.87]We are going to narrow this down to three.
[57:56.99]But to be clear, you can't decide 15 wins.
[58:00.57]The penultimate round is here.
[58:01.91]Let's see.
[58:02.79]Oh, nice.
[58:14.26]Holy shit, I was on camera.
[58:15.14]You got to see what it looked like.
[58:16.70]I mean, you don't, you know, I'm not talking about, like, you, like... No, you pick it up, and you, like, fold it up, and... And you let it, you eat it.
[58:30.50]I don't know, that was fucked up.
[58:32.32]I was having problems.
[58:34.03]Um, my internet's fine.
[58:37.23]Must use maintenance.
[58:41.67]natural peanut butter with the oil that settles and you have to mix it up a little bit or I'm telling you man sometimes I just scoop in there and I get a bunch of the top layer oil and a little bit of the top layer of peanut butter I eat it it's delicious you're drinking the oil I'm not I don't tip it up in like no I'm talking he's getting a little bit it's like a little test it's a little tasting like that's it man
[59:10.99]I need the inspiration.
[59:14.03]What's the point of this?
[59:18.32]Oh, thank God.
[59:19.14]Uh-oh.
[59:28.23]This is...
[59:32.86]And then measure out... There's too many of these!
[59:35.46]Way too many of these!
[59:36.92]I can eyeball that, I'm really good with that.
[59:42.26]Sorry, I just... pumpkins are just... Capu!
[59:51.69]Alright.
[59:58.71]There are way too many of those.
[60:01.45]I lost count.
[60:02.50]How many were there actually?
[60:03.64]How many nominees were there?
[60:09.90]20?
[60:12.32]Alright, that's never coming back.
[60:14.95]Here you go.
[60:15.41]Here's the last time you'll ever hear that sound.
[60:22.83]It's very cold.
[60:25.37]This must be hot cocoa at my hot cocoa poetry hour.
[60:28.75]Okay, so the winner, who cares?
[60:30.17]Does anybody give a shit about this?
[60:32.62]Who actually cares?
[60:34.06]Pre-recorded Andy.
[60:37.28]What did you say?
[60:43.23]There are 27 categories.
[60:50.17]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner for worst cat puke is, what do you think?
[60:58.43]Actual cat puke at 14.4%.
[61:00.47]You probably saw that one coming.
[61:04.52]Pitch black cat puke at 14.
[61:07.00]It was very close.
[61:08.96]And then eating eggs with 9.8%.
[61:12.38]By the way, I think two or three years running now, this is the most skipped category.
[61:18.43]Almost 20% of you that took this poll just skipped it.
[61:24.79]What's going on?
[61:27.06]What is that?
[61:29.40]The hacker is ahead of you.
[61:30.80]I don't understand what that means.
[61:35.90]What's going on back here?
[61:36.95]Why is that happening?
[61:40.55]Can you put it back to the snow?
[61:41.59]I want people to think I'm in an actual place with snow.
[61:44.09]Hold on, hey, hey, hey!
[61:50.34]You too.
[61:52.60]What's going on with my backdrop?
[61:56.02]Your backdrop is supposed to be snow, and there's like meme shit on it.
[61:59.95]You're gonna try something.
[62:01.97]You're gonna try something?
[62:04.97]This usually works.
[62:05.89]Well, whatever it is, it didn't work.
[62:08.31]You know what?
[62:09.35]Why don't we mess with him back?
[62:11.37]Why don't we send something that's really gonna mess this stuff up?
[62:13.11]Hello.
[62:14.45]Hey, hey, stop talking.
[62:15.91]Nobody talk.
[62:17.25]Who the fuck are you?
[62:18.25]Who am I?
[62:18.75]Who are you?
[62:19.69]What are you doing on my stream?
[62:21.67]What do you mean your stream?
[62:22.41]What do you mean my stream?
[62:23.14]Your stream.
[62:23.40]This is my Christmas special.
[62:24.66]What are you doing here?
[62:25.56]Is this the guy?
[62:26.66]Is this the fucking guy right here?
[62:29.36]Hey, bro.
[62:30.16]What's up?
[62:30.78]Hey, bro.
[62:32.58]What?
[62:33.64]So did you just hack it?
[62:35.22]Yo, he's a hacker.
[62:36.50]Wow, he's so skilled.
[62:37.96]My name's The Extinguisher.
[62:38.98]He's so talented.
[62:39.90]It's The Extinguisher.
[62:42.36]Wait, what?
[62:43.16]You will call me by my name, The Extinguisher.
[62:47.87]Your name is The Extinguisher?
[62:49.55]That's right.
[62:51.18]Did you get that name in like the fifth grade?
[62:52.82]That sounds like, what a terrible name.
[62:54.30]It was sixth grade.
[62:56.52]The extinguisher.
[62:57.78]Okay, extinguisher.
[62:59.50]How are you?
[63:00.34]How are things?
[63:01.76]Why, what are you doing?
[63:03.27]What is your goal here?
[63:04.95]Oh, my goal?
[63:06.65]My goal is to get you to apologize for all the things you haven't accomplished, Jerma.
[63:11.23]I've accomplished tons of stuff.
[63:12.25]We got dollhouse, we got the... What about the hundred gifted subs?
[63:17.39]100 gifted subs.
[63:18.25]Yeah.
[63:19.57]What do you mean?
[63:20.41]What happened about you not playing Yakuza?
[63:23.91]I thought you were going to play that one.
[63:25.51]Yeah, I'm going to.
[63:26.95]I didn't play Yakuza.
[63:28.27]That's why you hacked the stream.
[63:29.61]And $2 billion of debt.
[63:31.48]What are you, the government?
[63:33.68]That's, alright.
[63:34.36]Well, first of all, there's a couple things.
[63:35.78]Let me rebuttal.
[63:36.74]And after I rebuttal, maybe you'll give the channel back.
[63:39.04]Well, maybe when you play Glover, I'll give the channel back.
[63:43.18]I played Glover.
[63:44.06]That game sucked.
[63:45.42]What do you mean, play Glover?
[63:46.48]Is that what you're really on about here?
[63:47.64]And the chat loves it.
[63:49.72]Alright.
[63:50.04]Well, I kind of don't give a shit about anything that you're saying right now, because number one, I did try to give the community subs 100.
[63:56.99]My credit card got declined like five times.
[63:59.01]I did try.
[63:59.63]That didn't mean I'm not going.
[64:00.41]My credit card got declined like five times.
[64:02.09]That's literally what you sound like.
[64:03.77]Did you get his fucking area yet?
[64:07.33]You're never going to find me, Jeremiah.
[64:10.25]So what the hell?
[64:11.35]Are you just coming to taunt us?
[64:12.75]Is that what you're doing?
[64:13.31]Is that the fun you're going to have here?
[64:15.84]What are you doing?
[64:16.32]That's why I'm here.
[64:16.98]I'm here to taunt you.
[64:18.22]And I'm here to give the people what they want.
[64:21.64]Yeah.
[64:22.64]And what is that again?
[64:23.65]You're just hacking the channel?
[64:24.73]That's funny.
[64:25.73]That's funny.
[64:26.31]Everyone's laughing about it.
[64:27.51]I'm sure it's fun.
[64:28.69]Look at them.
[64:29.33]Look at them in the chat.
[64:30.73]Okay, well, thank you.
[64:31.57]I appreciate hearing from you.
[64:32.73]Now, can you please leave me alone?
[64:33.73]I have shit I have to do.
[64:35.19]Leave me the fuck alone.
[64:36.13]Well, no.
[64:39.47]Yeah, great response.
[64:40.69]No, that's the answer?
[64:42.41]Um, no.
[64:44.09]Okay.
[64:44.75]Well, you know what?
[64:45.39]What do you got?
[64:46.91]What do you got?
[64:47.61]Why don't we send him something fucked up?
[64:50.35]How does that sound?
[64:50.94]Do you guys have a connection?
[64:52.64]You have a connection?
[64:53.42]What if I do this?
[64:54.38]What do you mean?
[64:54.86]What do you mean?
[64:55.22]What if I do this?
[64:56.70]Huh?
[64:57.86]Stop doing that.
[64:59.10]Ah.
[64:59.84]That's funny.
[65:00.22]Not so fun, is it?
[65:01.56]I saw the IP address.
[65:03.55]Was that an IP?
[65:04.69]Yeah, try that on for size.
[65:07.90]Get that shit off.
[65:08.86]Look at your face.
[65:10.20]It's so angry.
[65:11.10]You're such an asshole.
[65:13.34]You have a connection, right?
[65:14.20]Send something back.
[65:15.26]Good.
[65:16.48]Send something back, guy.
[65:17.60]Eat shit, you hacker!
[65:19.77]It's the extinguisher.
[65:21.37]You will learn my name by the end of this stream.
[65:24.93]Hello, old chum.
[65:27.05]I'm Gnotto Gnove.
[65:28.61]You fucking idiot.
[65:29.39]I'm Gnotto Gnoblin.
[65:30.49]Did you do that?
[65:32.27]Yeah.
[65:32.49]I'm a gnome.
[65:33.03]What year is it?
[65:33.57]And you've been...
[65:35.91]What?
[65:36.17]I want to tell me what year it is.
[65:38.47]You're going to gnome the guy?
[65:39.87]That's so fucking stupid.
[65:42.07]Did you just gnome me on a live stream with over 20,000 people?
[65:46.71]That's so 2017.
[65:50.28]I don't... Why would you gnome somebody?
[65:53.68]That's all you can do, Beck?
[65:54.76]Get his location and send something else.
[66:00.41]Get us back access, for the love of God.
[66:04.68]Give me a fucking break, dude.
[66:08.20]You send a gnome over there.
[66:10.22]You know how bad that makes me look?
[66:13.98]We got Catboy Jerma.
[66:15.59]We got the Sasuke.
[66:16.55]He even turned off... I don't even know.
[66:18.51]We can't even turn this back to normal.
[66:21.13]What a disaster.
[66:22.99]Anyways, I may have made a few of these, but...
[66:31.04]You know, let's just get right into it.
[66:32.52]Everybody's waiting for this category, and it's a good one, so let's take our time with it.
[66:36.64]Ladies and gentlemen, here are the nominees for Worst Face of the Year.
[66:44.29]Fucking gnome, the guy.
[66:46.11]Unbelievable.
[66:54.04]Now, listen here, Batman.
[66:56.78]I think that's what's gonna happen.
[66:58.22]Let's find out.
[66:59.28]Turn the webcam on.
[67:04.48]I can see the music!
[67:19.82]That was such an ugly face, I hate that one.
[67:25.09]You look very handsome today.
[67:26.57]Thanks.
[67:29.25]This is bullshit again.
[67:38.05]He didn't do that before!
[67:45.67]Don't go 4-2 back because you're flipping spawns.
[67:50.93]Yeah.
[67:51.69]So, if we contain mid control and just hold them out and spawn, we should be fine.
[67:59.30]Wow!
[68:16.16]Okay, that wasn't even a real fight.
[68:20.50]You can see every, like, inch of my face, too.
[68:23.18]I don't like this.
[68:23.96]I hate this.
[68:27.48]Oh!
[68:28.12]Holy shit, people are so ugly with light, aren't they?
[68:30.90]See?
[68:33.58]This is me.
[68:36.40]My face.
[68:55.44]Do you honestly think I don't know the horse has a dodge 65 hours into the game?
[69:08.89]I thought she was doing another move.
[69:10.14]I thought that was the big sweeping one.
[69:12.16]Oh my god.
[69:13.68]Fuck this fight.
[69:15.52]Fuck this game.
[69:16.60]Return it.
[69:17.04]I don't have 100 hours in it, but I'm returning it.
[69:19.80]I'm going up to the counter with these eyes like this.
[69:22.18]The fucking GameStop that I got this piece of shit from.
[69:24.54]I'm going to be like, hey, yeah, I would like to make a return, please.
[69:30.77]More games for your wax face.
[69:34.99]Prepare yourselves.
[69:43.63]Find me a path I can go.
[69:45.07]Find me one path.
[69:53.64]That was weird.
[70:02.60]Abbot's a holy man.
[70:03.16]Okay.
[70:03.28]I wonder where I go from here though.
[70:05.36]If I had to keep it all in, after like an hour, I'd be like this.
[70:07.96]It would be insane.
[70:08.92]I would explode.
[70:10.58]Okay.
[70:39.20]Put that in here.
[70:44.39]I'm just going up the stairs.
[70:45.49]I don't give a shit if he hears me.
[70:51.11]I thought he was downstairs.
[71:09.46]What happened?
[71:10.10]Oh, I ran in a circle.
[71:11.00]That was a chicken.
[71:15.61]That was a fucking rooster.
[71:17.75]That was a rooster.
[71:18.53]That was actually a rooster.
[71:20.77]Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[71:35.50]Fuck you.
[71:36.34]Come on.
[71:37.26]Oh, Rick.
[71:41.82]Rick.
[71:45.16]Was that an oh, Rick at the end?
[71:47.14]What was that?
[71:48.72]Oh, Rick.
[71:52.68]Yeah, I have a tendency to make faces.
[71:55.25]But, you know, whatever.
[71:57.63]It is what it is.
[71:58.25]This is gonna be news to me because we don't know.
[72:03.23]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the worst face of the year.
[72:07.97]It was pretty close.
[72:10.66]You look very handsome today at 16.8% of the vote.
[72:15.82]jermaCheesed is a little bit further after that at 11.4%.
[72:20.14]And then Smushed Sleeping Face, which if you had asked me, I thought would have been number one.
[72:26.27]So you look very handsome today.
[72:28.27]This one, that one there.
[72:30.33]I do that apparently frequently, but yeah.
[72:33.49]You look very handsome today.
[72:39.32]Don't do, it's this one.
[72:41.38]That's fine.
[72:42.68]Alright, you can't nominate this stream because it's literally the day we're doing this.
[72:48.95]We're gonna do best accident now.
[72:52.11]Rick!
[72:54.65]Best accident is when something goes wrong during a stream and we need to figure out how to fix it.
[73:01.28]So that's where we are now.
[73:03.96]This is the sixth category.
[73:05.36]Still plenty, still plenty to do today.
[73:08.92]So ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for Best Accident of the Year.
[73:21.15]Blue Bunny makes the best grocery store ice cream.

[74:03.53]Don't do it down there.
[74:04.97]Don't do it down here.
[74:06.65]Don't do that down here.
[74:09.95]You do not want this sound to be playing while I'm doing it down here.
[74:12.47]It's time to fight some crime.
[74:16.15]Made some adjustments to my suit.
[74:17.61]I feel like it's a little more appropriate.
[74:24.47]Let's go.
[74:24.89]Are you fucking kidding me?
[74:33.44]What are you... Those!
[74:44.70]No, I'm doing the thing.
[74:45.54]I'm doing the thing, that fucking meme.
[74:48.06]I'm not grunting.
[74:49.52]What sex noises are you talking about?
[74:53.11]I've been silent the whole time.
[75:00.17]What are you talking about?
[75:01.09]I've been silent the whole time.

[76:13.99]okay that's enough of that that's enough of that one that's it we're not doing that one again we're not doing that one ever again it's good yeah and I was talking about a little recipe that I had if you don't know what hamburger this is what it looks like it doesn't look like that uh it doesn't look like that it looks like this whipped cream okay
[76:46.03]I've been waiting all week to do this one.
[76:47.37]Alright, get in there.
[76:48.17]I don't think I made it.
[76:56.67]I'm assuming it missed.
[76:57.55]I can't tell.
[76:58.89]Do not flip the card under any circumstance.
[77:02.28]Don't do it.
[77:03.54]It's not funny.
[77:04.56]It's not a joke.
[77:06.66]It would be annoying because you just wasted like 35 straight minutes cutting wood.
[77:11.84]Jeremy, I know you think you're quite the comedian.
[77:16.30]but this is not the time to do that.
[77:18.54]Let's go.
[77:23.46]And a lot of people are gonna think that that was on purpose, but it was not.
[77:28.28]You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[77:31.21]I'm gonna quit the game.
[77:37.43]I make a lot of mistakes.
[77:41.71]I see the spam in the chat.
[77:44.23]We're working on it.
[77:46.56]Just relax.
[77:47.80]We're working on it.
[77:50.66]Yeah, I mess up a lot.
[77:52.28]It seems to be a theme on the channel, doesn't it?
[77:54.94]Let's see.
[77:55.30]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best accident is... Let's find out.
[78:06.33]I mean, you could have guessed this was gonna be the one.
[78:10.85]The mask falls off Spider-Man at 15.6% of the vote.
[78:15.79]Nice job, Spider-Man, you get to see the outline of my dick, if you zoomed in.
[78:20.63]I mean, don't do that, but you can see the outline of my dick and whatever, that's fine.
[78:26.63]My favorite ice cream, let's take a look at 11.8%, which that's sad, because I really do think that that is the, I think that is the best ice cream.
[78:38.44]That's so fucking stupid, I was so disappointed.
[78:41.02]And then Booty Smash at 11% it took up.
[78:45.41]This is pretty even.
[78:47.23]It looks like, you know, everything after Booty Smash was like within 1%.
[78:53.01]So everything below that was just within 1% of each other.
[78:58.28]So make sure I'm not going to see my dick on this stream.
[79:02.38]Okay.
[79:03.42]Don't want to do that.
[79:05.00]Alright, after this, we're gonna take a quick break after this, because I'm gonna try to get back on the goddamn channel.
[79:11.09]We're gonna go dark for a second, but this is best overdone Boston moment.
[79:15.51]If you don't know what that is, so best overdone Boston moment, I'll give you an example.
[79:26.87]Dude, this fucking cookie sucks, dude.
[79:29.31]Where'd you get these fucking cookies?
[79:30.52]The fucking toilet?
[79:33.99]Where'd you find this, in a fucking dumpster?
[79:37.03]New category this year, by the way.
[79:38.51]This is a new category.
[79:41.55]So here are your nominees for Best Over Don Boston Moment.
[79:47.13]Don't show my dick on camera.
[79:55.98]I know God what he was coming to him, man.
[79:57.74]Don't worry, I got plenty left for you, you fucking idiot.
[80:01.16]Okay, kid.
[80:02.64]Ultimate destruction!
[80:05.65]Oh, it's fucking stupid, fucking dumb, fucking stupid, fucking game, fucking game, fucking stupid shit.
[80:10.87]Yeah, that's fucking stupid.
[80:12.53]Yeah!
[80:14.42]I hate this fucking category.
[80:19.08]Your Boston's showing.
[80:20.80]Three, two, one.
[80:23.76]Happy fucking New Year!
[80:25.96]And, uh... D-I-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-
[80:36.02]And all the Red Sox players should fucking get paid more than the Yankees do.
[80:48.12]And all the Patriots who cares about Tom Brady.
[80:53.74]He's a fucking loser.
[80:55.83]I don't even fucking care.
[80:59.94]and all the revolution as a soccer team and the Bruins and fuck you for fucking talking shit to me about my mother behind my back that one time that year and I fucking never forgot.
[81:15.87]Do you still consider yourself a Bostonian?
[81:17.41]Of course I do, kid.
[81:19.31]Did you just take Boston?
[81:21.57]No.
[81:22.71]That's fucking bullshit, dude.
[81:24.41]Alright, kid, listen, that's fucking stupid.
[81:27.65]Alright, fucking listen, kid.
[81:29.63]I'll see you outside any donkeys anytime.
[81:31.81]Oh, shut the fuck up.
[81:32.45]You bring a pack of cigarettes and I'll fucking see you there.
[81:35.45]Hey, hey, hey.
[81:39.19]Hey.
[81:39.53]What are those brown slacks called?
[81:41.51]Oh, they're called cockies.
[81:45.01]How do you drive your car?
[81:46.43]Oh, with fucking cockies.
[81:50.26]Jeremy, you're spending so much fucking time with these ants.
[81:53.87]I mean, there's other shit to do, man.
[81:55.23]You're spending a lot of time with these fucking ants, dude.
[81:56.87]I can't believe I did this, this much.
[81:59.11]You've been outside a lot.
[82:00.36]You're just like, you're digging around looking for fucking ants.
[82:01.98]I don't, I don't know what is... I'm getting a little concerned about you.
[82:06.33]I love how I've turned, for you guys, like, the Boston accent guy into things that, like, I'm allowed to kind of come out of my, like, I can just say whatever I want as that voice, that character, and it's universally despised anything I say.
[82:21.34]I don't know why it has to be, like, the Boston guy with the cigarette outside of a CVS.
[82:26.18]Like, I don't know why it has to be that guy.
[82:28.00]It's just like... Yeah, man, I wish they were fucking two drive-thrus, or three drive-thru windows instead of one at, like, every restaurant.
[82:38.24]Alright, dude, like... Okay.
[82:42.08]This fucking game is fucking stupid.
[82:48.30]Where's the one with- where's the one with the go?
[82:52.04]Chad, you fucking, uh, what was it?
[82:56.56]This game's for fucking kids, I don't give a fuck.
[83:00.94]I'm playing a fucking kids game and you guys are fucking shitting the fucking chat.
[83:05.98]Yeah, okay.
[83:08.76]Pickle nose, pickle nose.
[83:10.08]Did you fucking say that?
[83:13.50]Pickle nose?
[83:14.14]What the fuck up?
[83:16.46]What's up, dude?
[83:19.82]Yeah, that armor's pretty fucking cool.
[83:21.66]That's pretty sick armor.
[83:23.14]I can't take this anymore.
[83:24.68]I mean, I got that magic defense on it, though.
[83:26.91]Pretty fucking cool.
[83:27.53]With the two more minutes?
[83:29.67]My taillight does stuff like that, too, but magic is pretty low on it, right?
[83:32.69]Alright, fucking, alright, kid.
[83:34.05]Alright, fucking see you later, dude.
[83:36.73]Hey, mom, I said hi.
[83:40.87]Not in like a weird, not like, you know what I mean?
[83:42.51]That was like supposed to be respectful.
[83:44.13]That was not supposed to be mean.
[83:50.47]We're ready for the fucking rain of stars.
[83:52.71]Hey, you know, fucking something about fucking the starlight kid.
[83:56.41]Oh, fucking starlight.
[83:58.77]I fucking hate this.
[83:59.69]I'm annoying.
[84:01.11]How do we cut this category off quick?
[84:03.73]I'm farming for souls that I want to die at the boss.
[84:05.59]This boss story is going to be hard.
[84:08.15]I'm your cousin from Boston.
[84:12.21]It's a fucking Lager.
[84:12.95]You don't know what a Lager is, dude?
[84:15.07]I'm your cousin.
[84:17.59]I wasn't looking.
[84:19.11]Oh, so I was back in Massachusetts, right?
[84:20.84]Because obviously I was in the wedding stuff.
[84:23.96]And I could tell I was back in Massachusetts.
[84:26.16]It had been a while.
[84:28.78]I was driving.
[84:30.46]And I just hear... I'm just sitting there.
[84:32.54]I pull through a red light.
[84:33.74]And I just hear out the window...
[84:36.29]You fucking douchebag!
[84:37.79]There's somebody who's just screaming at somebody.
[84:41.50]They do just kind of stand here.
[84:42.60]They're all fucking terrible.
[84:45.28]Hey, what's in the telescope?
[84:46.36]What are you looking at, Mars?
[84:47.28]Look at that.
[84:50.22]Oh, look at his artwork.
[84:52.15]That shouldn't even know.
[84:52.83]Look at his artwork.
[84:53.83]Why is it snowing?
[84:54.99]Oh, dude, this is probably where that fucking foxy comes out of.
[84:58.90]I heard this.
[84:59.52]My fucking son played this one.
[85:01.42]Fucking foxy comes out of there and sprints down the fucking hallway.
[85:03.52]It was fucked up.
[85:05.78]They walk down halls and stuff.
[85:06.92]They fucking walk down the hall.
[85:08.72]I played it before.
[85:09.38]I know it.
[85:09.94]Wait.
[85:11.36]Oh, shit.
[85:12.15]There it is.
[85:15.39]Okay.
[85:17.94]I'll fucking drop this guy if he fucking comes in my- if he comes over to the door, I'm gonna fucking drop him.
[85:22.54]Apparently, I don't- I have a catchphrase between me and my girlfriend that I don't even realize I have it.
[85:27.65]And I- I- apparently I say like, oh, fucking like, Golic.
[85:30.77]Uh, Golic, kid.
[85:31.49]Oh yeah, give me some fucking Golic, dude.
[85:34.35]For no reason, apparently.
[85:35.39]And I'm like, no, there has to be a reason of why I'm saying like, oh, fucking Golic.
[85:39.15]I just do like a Boston accent joke.
[85:41.84]And I say Golic.
[85:50.13]Okay, so the winner for, is it best or worst?
[85:54.23]That's the question I have.
[85:56.17]It's best overdone Boston moment, not worst overdone Boston moment.
[86:04.03]People saying Maz, Maz is the one, I don't know.
[86:06.77]I actually, let's find out.
[86:08.73]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the worst overdone Boston moment, really?
[86:19.62]It's the Golic catchphrase story at 22.2% of the vote.
[86:26.63]Golic catchphrase.
[86:27.99]Me explaining that I have a catchphrase.
[86:30.47]And then the Tom Brady New Year's Eve song at 11.8% for the New Year's Eve song.
[86:40.46]And then the Boston guy plays Five Nights at Freddy's at 10%.
[86:46.15]Also, keep this in mind, that was the second most skipped category.
[86:51.47]Under cat puke, so nobody gave a shit about that one.
[86:56.06]I don't blame them, I really don't.
[86:58.42]It's funny just how many things people did skip.
[87:02.42]People probably went to this list and saw, I ain't taking all 27 of these.
[87:07.00]No, I'm skipping this, we're skipping this, we're skipping this, but this is the second most skipped category, which it makes sense.
[87:12.73]Why don't we check in with the elves?
[87:14.63]How are the elves doing on the puzzle?
[87:16.37]Can we go take a look?
[87:18.63]How are they?
[87:21.11]Elves, how are you?
[87:23.13]They haven't done anything.
[87:27.53]It just looks like you've poured a box of fruity pebbles on the ground.
[87:31.82]There's nothing even there.
[87:37.03]Let's stay with them for a few minutes.
[87:41.62]I'm gonna go pee.
[91:02.93]Hey, who cares if you get your channel hacked on Christmas time, right?
[91:05.99]Who cares?
[91:07.71]Welcome back, everybody.
[91:08.95]Welcome to the award show Christmas special.
[91:13.06]Yes!
[91:14.36]Come on!
[91:15.84]Who cares if there's somebody playing Call of Duty on my channel right now?
[91:20.64]Fuck them, right?
[91:22.08]We're going to have fun over here.
[91:24.55]What about the elves?
[91:25.45]What's wrong with the elves?
[91:28.11]It doesn't look like they just poured, like I said, a box of cereal on the ground.
[91:30.97]They haven't made any progress.
[91:32.53]At all.
[91:33.91]Absolutely zero progress.
[91:39.13]Okay.
[91:40.15]So, uh, how does it look today?
[91:41.85]Huh?
[91:42.27]How does it look?
[91:45.87]We're doing that one now.
[91:48.14]This is the eighth category of the night.
[91:51.54]Hey.
[91:53.98]How's that for you?
[91:55.56]How's that look?
[91:57.20]This is worst hair, not today, but you know, I've had some bad hair.
[92:00.78]Most of these are from VR, which is kind of unfair, if I'm honest.
[92:07.27]I just heard the production go, don't open that.
[92:10.63]Alright, so ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for worst hair of the year.
[92:23.98]Can we please get a Zoinks?
[92:37.21]Like, zoink, Scoop!
[92:40.05]I fucking banned that person.
[92:41.35]I actually banned that person for like an hour because they just made me do that and I fucking hated it.
[92:46.22]Want a hair check?
[92:47.04]Sure.
[92:53.10]Hold on one sec.
[93:07.98]I think it's because I, like, went to... My hair has a weird growing pattern.
[93:13.36]Is it that bad?
[93:14.05]Alright, it is bad.
[93:15.91]But listen.
[93:17.05]My hair is a lot thinner here.
[93:19.61]Look at how much thicker my hair is here.
[93:21.97]You see?
[93:23.17]It's really... I have really thick hair here.
[93:26.05]And really thin hair here.
[93:27.78]I didn't shave this.
[93:32.86]You know what?
[93:33.16]I don't even care.
[93:33.58]Just fuck the whole thing up.
[93:40.91]What is going on?
[93:47.93]I do look like a big kid.
[93:50.68]What's happening right now?
[93:52.32]I look like a big kid.
[93:53.98]What's going on?
[93:55.60]He's balding.
[93:57.74]I mean, yeah.
[93:59.17]Not really, though.
[93:59.81]I'm 36.
[94:01.65]Not really.
[94:02.77]You dream you'll look like this when you're 36.
[94:05.45]He's right.
[94:05.83]You dream.
[94:06.57]Keep dreaming you'll look as good as I do right now at 36.
[94:08.43]He's right.
[94:08.97]Listen to him.
[94:10.05]Can they hear me?
[94:11.25]Keep dreaming.
[94:13.64]Wait, let me say that again when it looks better.
[94:16.20]You're not going to get away, Green Goblin.
[94:18.64]Wait a minute.
[94:22.54]They probably heard that.
[94:23.10]That's not Green Goblin.
[94:29.42]It's really great.
[94:30.08]I don't know why.
[94:31.02]This thing was expensive, too.
[94:32.10]What if I go, like, up this way?
[94:41.62]We're trying a new hairstyle.
[94:48.47]This is just Donald Trump's hair on my head.
[94:52.69]My hair looks like it came out of the oven and it's done.
[95:00.14]This looks like cooked hair.
[95:04.77]My hair looked different.
[95:05.71]Like, it's done now.
[95:06.75]It's ready.
[95:08.15]I wanted to stream today.
[95:10.97]Why do your sideburns look like pubes?
[95:17.62]I haven't seen this video.
[95:24.93]Dude, I don't know.
[95:26.53]I haven't had a haircut in, oh man.
[95:30.53]He looks off.
[95:32.70]Maybe you think it's because of this?
[95:35.28]Do you think it has anything to do with whatever this is right now?
[95:37.98]Do you think it has anything to do with how off I look today?
[95:42.14]I wonder if you think it has anything to do with that.
[95:51.16]Pube hair.
[95:54.22]Okay.
[95:56.80]Look, before I open this, I'm 37.
[96:02.06]You get older, your hair gets a little scraggly, gets a little weird, but it's still there.
[96:07.14]I still have it all.
[96:08.78]I know people that are way younger than me and some that are way older than me that do not have this.
[96:15.45]So whatever, oh, look at your hairline, look at that.
[96:17.71]Oh, wow, it's growing.
[96:18.87]Oh yeah, you'll see.
[96:19.65]When you're almost 40, you come talk to me.
[96:21.27]How does that sound?
[96:22.39]When you're almost 40, you come talk to me.
[96:25.05]The winner of worst hair of the year is
[96:34.79]It was close.
[96:37.40]22.1% of the vote.
[96:38.74]What do you think it was?
[96:39.58]Chat, what do you think?
[96:41.44]Let me see.
[96:48.72]Off, Andy, off.
[96:50.14]He looks off.
[96:51.06]No, not even close.
[96:54.13]The winner is pube sideburns at 22% of that, okay.
[96:59.24]Greasy cooked hair at 19% and then shaggy hair gets a chat member banned at 11.7% of the vote.
[97:08.98]So pube sideburns, pube sideburns wins.

[101:48.01]I have no idea what he wants.
[101:50.13]He's got ownership of that channel right now, and he's making it very, don't think about it too much.
[101:55.89]Easy.
[101:57.90]During the break, I calm down a little bit.
[102:00.00]But it's kinda hard to.
[102:03.26]So this is best auto moment.
[102:06.31]And Best Otto Moment is a great category considering that I think every single nominee on this list were the only times Otto was shown on screen.
[102:14.89]I think it's five times or six times over the year, so there's six nominees, and here they are for Best Otto Moment.
[102:34.13]Otto!
[102:38.41]I feel like we've had turkey now.
[102:42.79]He was very sleepy.
[102:46.86]Are you tired?
[102:47.32]Maybe it's a good idea just to turn the VPN on and have it just kind of go somewhere else and have the traffic come in a circle.
[103:02.57]He knows there's a treat.
[103:04.75]He's right here.
[103:06.57]God, he needs to lose some weight.
[103:09.11]Hello, Aiko.
[103:11.01]He's so chunky.
[103:13.93]He needs to lose at least a pound or two.
[103:16.97]He's very chunky.
[103:23.56]He's snoring.
[103:25.98]He's doing that like... He's like dreaming and snoring at the same time.
[103:34.97]Yeah, yes, he has two beds.
[103:36.35]He's like Snoopy.
[103:37.89]He doesn't like that one.
[103:40.31]How do I really feel?
[103:42.41]He's a C. He went from F to C. He's a little too buttery at the end.
[103:50.94]Oh, it's over Cantaloupe, for sure.
[103:53.66]It's over Pepsi, for sure.
[103:57.86]The same stream.
[104:05.40]He's just in the corner.
[104:14.59]I mean, they all win.
[104:16.69]It's every single one wins.
[104:18.85]There's no winner for best auto moment.
[104:20.85]It's just anytime he's on camera, it's fun.
[104:24.42]It's best, do we need to even, do we declare a winner?
[104:27.20]Can they all win?
[104:28.80]They all win, I think.
[104:30.75]Wow, whoa, actually, this is crazy.
[104:33.85]Best Otto moment of the year is... At 48% of the vote, sleepy Otto in Jerma's arms.
[104:44.88]And then at 19%, snoring in the cheaper bed.
[104:47.76]And then 11% is Otto is a little chunky.
[104:52.30]It always gets chunky.
[104:54.56]What?
[104:54.80]Who is talking in Meijer?
[104:56.22]Who's what?
[104:58.34]Hello, Jerma.
[104:59.89]What's up, dude?
[105:01.47]I've got a proposal for you.
[105:03.87]I've already heard about it.
[105:04.81]People have been coming over here.
[105:06.99]Hey, how's your stream going, by the way?
[105:09.46]My stream?
[105:10.20]Yeah, how's your stream going?
[105:11.54]It's going great.
[105:13.58]It's going great.
[105:14.94]How's the Call of Duty campaign?
[105:16.80]How's that going?
[105:18.20]You get through the first part yet?
[105:19.44]People love it.
[105:20.40]I'm on the second level.
[105:23.46]I'm quite good.
[105:25.26]People are asking for hot tips, and I've been giving them out.
[105:28.94]Okay, so, and what can I do for you?
[105:31.42]I've heard there's a 1v1 scenario that we're going to do.
[105:33.67]Yes, well, do you want your stream back or not?
[105:35.67]I'm feeling Christmassy.
[105:37.33]Yep.
[105:39.47]I'm feeling in the mood.
[105:42.37]And you're feeling in the mood for what, exactly?
[105:43.97]You want a 1v1 me in Call of Duty and I destroy you and I get the channel back?
[105:47.19]Is that what it is?
[105:47.99]That's right.
[105:48.89]That's your proposal?
[105:49.81]That's the proposal, yes.
[105:52.50]So let me just make sure I break this down completely.
[105:56.12]If I beat you in a 1v1 in Call of Duty, you will give me the channel back.
[106:01.54]That's right.
[106:02.64]No bullshit.
[106:03.82]I've set up the lobby and everything.
[106:05.54]First to five, best of three.
[106:07.62]First to five, best of three.
[106:08.54]And you're not messing around or anything.
[106:09.69]This is for real.
[106:10.73]Oh, no, no.
[106:11.45]I wouldn't lie to you, Jerma.
[106:13.21]Is he lying?
[106:13.77]I don't lie.
[106:15.43]You lie.
[106:16.57]Do you have me over there?
[106:18.19]Did you get the information from him?
[106:19.75]Cheeseburgers.
[106:23.45]Do you have it?
[106:24.55]Do you have it?
[106:24.99]Yeah.
[106:25.25]Well, so if I win, I get the channel back.
[106:28.09]If you win, you get the channel back.
[106:29.87]Let's fucking go.
[106:30.63]Let's go then.
[106:31.19]Let's go.
[106:32.23]I need some support back here, please.
[106:35.39]What do you need?
[106:37.33]I need, excuse me.
[106:39.04]I need a little bit of support here.
[106:40.94]I don't know anything about Call of Duty.
[106:42.34]Time to focus up.
[106:43.06]Time to focus up.
[106:43.90]Look alive.
[106:44.30]Open your mouth.
[106:44.70]Open your mouth.
[106:46.19]Is this a team?
[106:48.70]What are we, boxing?
[106:49.60]You're supposed to do it very gently.
[106:52.14]We've done bro versus bro.
[106:53.18]We know you're not the best gamer.
[106:54.34]You're going to have to focus.
[106:55.72]Stop, stop, stop.
[106:56.40]We need this.
[106:57.08]Listen, listen to me.
[106:58.08]We need this.
[106:58.76]Quiet, quiet.
[107:01.50]What's the best loadout in Call of Duty Modern Warfare?
[107:03.86]Can you get him off the fucking screen before I puke?
[107:06.61]What is that?
[107:07.33]Oh, thank you.
[107:07.83]I appreciate that.
[107:08.33]I think your play style is a run and gun.
[107:10.27]Did you just put makeup on me?
[107:11.29]Sub-machine gun.
[107:12.19]What did you just do?
[107:13.13]War paint.
[107:13.55]Did you just put war paint on?
[107:15.09]War paint.
[107:15.45]This is going to be off for the rest of the day now.
[107:17.81]What the hell?
[107:19.13]You ready?
[107:19.77]Just believe in yourself.
[107:21.54]What's worse, having paint on your face for the rest of the day or having him on your channel for the rest of the day?
[107:24.78]Think about that.
[107:25.32]Come on.
[107:26.34]Let's see here.
[107:27.34]It's do or die.
[107:28.16]Hey, are you a fan of Ludwig?
[107:31.59]Variety streamer.
[107:32.60]Do you know Ludwig at all?
[107:33.64]He does.
[107:33.92]Hello?
[107:34.30]Do you know Atriac at all?
[107:35.70]Oh, you're talking to me.
[107:37.32]I'm sorry.
[107:37.70]I'm setting up the game for you because you don't know how to play.
[107:40.71]Alright, alright, alright.
[107:41.43]It's time.
[107:42.37]Am I ready?
[107:42.87]Cheeseburgers.
[107:44.09]1v1 and I get the channel back.
[107:45.73]Alright, so first to five.
[107:47.63]I'll put a 10-minute limit on it.
[107:49.11]Can I get everybody in here, please?
[107:50.89]I need support.
[107:51.93]I need to be taught how to do this shit.
[107:53.22]Tighten up, man.
[107:54.08]I'm gonna choose the best man.
[107:58.32]What's your class?
[107:58.98]What's your class?
[107:59.70]I don't know what class means.
[108:00.66]Submachine gun.
[108:01.66]Long, light machine gun.
[108:03.39]Bring back your old days.
[108:04.37]Machine gun?
[108:05.37]I don't know what any of this means.
[108:06.51]That makes sense.
[108:08.31]Am I in the lobby?
[108:09.31]Just focus.
[108:10.26]Don't worry about it yet.
[108:11.26]Why is Mom going to buy stuff in the store?
[108:13.06]Don't worry about buying things.
[108:14.41]How do I get this off?
[108:15.39]This is going to be on all day.
[108:16.59]Look, it comes off easy.
[108:21.19]It'll come off, it'll come off.
[108:23.41]Where, did I get an invite?
[108:25.24]Are you buying the, don't, why are you buying the skin?
[108:27.34]I was buying the bundle.
[108:28.20]Extinguisher.
[108:29.00]Who the fuck are you?
[108:29.76]Extinguisher.
[108:30.42]I'm the engineer.
[108:31.06]Oh, you were sitting here, sorry.
[108:33.06]Extinguisher, that's gotta be.
[108:34.70]Come on, come on, come on.
[108:36.65]Ah, there you are.
[108:37.57]Alright.
[108:39.05]Can somebody get me a snack, please?
[108:40.41]Alright.
[108:45.49]I don't want that.
[108:49.35]I don't want that either.
[108:51.33]You want to chew it up?
[108:52.07]No.
[108:52.19]I can chew it up for you.
[108:53.21]Do you need water?
[108:57.89]If you don't dump it on me.
[108:58.85]Okay, Jeremy, you get yourself a little juice box.
[109:01.15]You get yourself some face paint.
[109:03.20]Alright, go, go, go, go.
[109:05.54]Everyone, I want to start a chant.

[109:21.13]Are you sure you're ready, Jeremy?
[109:24.67]Go.
[109:26.16]Your whole existence is on the line right now.
[109:29.52]This engineer was on Facebook for, like, the last probably hour.
[109:31.88]Who are you even writing to on here?
[109:34.54]Still one of the most popular websites in Europe for, like, social media.
[109:37.32]What is this?
[109:37.77]Alright.
[109:38.27]You ready?
[109:38.81]Let's go.

[109:43.55]I'm the extinguisher.
[109:45.25]What is this?
[109:45.77]Nutri-Grain Bar?
[109:46.81]What is this thing?
[109:48.09]Fuel.
[109:48.21]You want to wash it down?
[109:53.84]No.
[109:54.95]Where are you running to, my friend?
[109:56.25]Okay.
[109:58.77]It's just waiting for host.
[110:00.07]Are you the host?
[110:01.35]Yes, I'm the host.
[110:03.17]You have to make the call.
[110:05.60]Oh, I got to send you another invite because you don't know how to play.
[110:09.70]I'm in the lobby right now, Extinguisher.
[110:12.62]Okay.
[110:13.00]What, you booted me?
[110:13.90]You know what?
[110:15.48]You start the back out of the lobby.
[110:16.44]Invite him.
[110:16.86]What the fuck?
[110:17.50]Invite him.
[110:18.14]Invite on your turf.
[110:19.12]Invite on my turf?
[110:20.34]I'll play on your turf.
[110:21.32]It doesn't matter the turf.
[110:26.03]A lot of friends going on here.
[110:27.01]Right there.
[110:27.51]Right there.
[110:27.87]That's him.
[110:28.25]That's him.
[110:28.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[110:29.51]Where do I go from here?
[110:30.39]Join game?
[110:30.85]Yeah, sure.
[110:31.21]Join his game.
[110:31.65]Fuck it.
[110:32.65]Hey, what do you think about that?
[110:33.93]Are we ready?
[110:34.39]I just backed out of the game.
[110:36.33]I just backed out of the game.
[110:37.87]Who are these people?
[110:39.04]Who are these people?
[110:40.10]Get out of that lobby.
[110:41.12]Who are these people?
[110:42.28]There's so many people in this lobby.
[110:43.66]Invite him.
[110:44.72]Invite him.
[110:45.10]Invite him.
[110:46.16]I see him.
[110:46.70]I see him.
[110:47.00]Join your lobby.
[110:48.18]Yeah, but I think he's in a lobby with a bunch of people.
[110:51.08]There's people in here!
[110:57.41]Who are these people?
[110:58.23]I think he's just in a regular lobby.
[110:59.54]He's in a free-for-all.
[111:00.32]He's in a free-for-all!
[111:01.24]Who puts his hires in a 1v1?
[111:06.09]How are the random people, how do these people get in the lobby?
[111:08.67]Moist Bagel.
[111:09.79]Moist Bagel.
[111:11.07]The extinguisher doesn't even know how these people got in.
[111:14.09]A friend request?
[111:15.07]No, we're not doing that.
[111:16.07]We'll accept that.
[111:16.79]We all want to be your friends.
[111:17.99]I need somebody from production to help me.
[111:19.97]Oh God, it's going.
[111:22.01]Let's see.
[111:22.57]Alright, alright, what happened?
[111:24.07]You gotta set up a private party, maybe customize, maybe customize.
[111:27.18]Yes, set up private.
[111:28.56]Invite him to your party.
[111:29.88]I'm kidding, I'll make a private one.
[111:31.08]It says here in the main menu, you're supposed to be a hacker.
[111:33.86]And a free for all.
[111:34.56]He's good at hacking, not Call of Duty.
[111:36.54]Invite him to the party here.
[111:38.20]Well, you leaked the stream key.
[111:39.48]What do you mean it might have been?
[111:41.02]How do you know?
[111:41.42]It was one of you two.
[111:42.34]I sent you in a DM.
[111:43.46]You know I wouldn't do that to you.
[111:45.25]I don't know who leaked it.
[111:46.09]Well, you are the one who was supposed to give it to production.
[111:47.99]Let me tell you right now, don't ever ask me for a stream key in a DM.
[111:50.89]Like, that's actually stupid, and I don't know why I listened to you.
[111:53.21]You responded to it, so it's 50-50.
[111:54.99]It goes two ways.
[111:55.79]I mean, you're the star of the show.
[111:58.29]No, we love it.
[111:59.15]We love you.
[112:00.03]It's just like, wait.
[112:03.13]Okay, good news, he's in our lobby.
[112:05.13]Good news.
[112:05.61]Good news.
[112:06.31]Good news, everyone.
[112:07.29]You can win this, Jerma.
[112:09.29]I am still just thinking about how much I want to strangle you.
[112:11.65]Right.
[112:12.89]Well, okay.
[112:15.09]You don't mean that.
[112:15.77]Can the other people in the room hear me?
[112:17.05]We're trying to get a private match.
[112:18.35]Private match.
[112:19.45]Multiplayer.
[112:20.13]Create private match.
[112:21.35]Can they answer this one question?
[112:23.29]Classic.
[112:23.81]He wants to ask you guys a question.
[112:26.21]Is his face as red as his hair right now?
[112:28.96]What's a good one?
[112:29.68]Knockout?
[112:31.13]We want to go free-for-all.
[112:32.28]Free-for-all.
[112:33.18]Free-for-all.
[112:33.76]Alright.
[112:35.24]Five kills.
[112:36.68]Finally.
[112:37.10]I mean, the hacker, seriously, you thought you could set this whole thing up.
[112:40.30]Locked.
[112:40.90]Are we good to go?
[112:41.94]You've got a whole team of people.
[112:44.04]Yeah.
[112:44.50]Where's your, by the way, where are all your team of hype friends?
[112:47.52]Yeah.
[112:48.04]Yeah, right?
[112:48.68]Hour of friendship.
[112:49.44]Hour of Christmas.
[112:50.04]Right here.
[112:51.70]Oh.
[112:52.18]We going?
[112:52.72]Let's go.
[112:53.44]Okay.
[112:53.74]Alright.
[112:54.08]Alright.
[112:54.32]Focus up.
[112:54.66]Focus up.
[112:55.00]Focus up.
[112:55.34]Focus up.
[112:55.64]Come on, baby.
[112:57.98]You keep spilling.
[112:59.02]Are you ready?
[112:59.38]Well, you keep aiming wrong.
[113:00.40]Okay.
[113:00.78]Is this a good loadout?
[113:01.66]No, no, no.
[113:02.02]Custom loadout, too.
[113:02.68]Try it.
[113:03.70]Yeah, submachine gun.
[113:05.00]It's run and gun.
[113:05.82]Run and gun.
[113:06.32]Okay.
[113:06.64]Keep moving.
[113:07.42]Okay.
[113:07.83]Keep on your toes.
[113:08.47]So should I try to aim at the head or headshots or what?
[113:10.45]You're not wearing a headset?
[113:11.73]Headshots or what?
[113:13.01]Headshots or what?
[113:13.67]Just hit him in the body.
[113:14.89]It doesn't matter.
[113:15.43]Shoot him with a gun.
[113:16.71]Hey, yeah, let's go, punk.
[113:18.71]Alright.
[113:19.03]Okay.
[113:19.51]Alright.
[113:21.27]Come on, Jerma, let's go!
[113:26.30]We need the channel back, we need the channel back.
[113:29.76]Tighten up, tighten up.
[113:31.08]We got PepsiCo on the phone, we got everybody screaming at us.
[113:33.38]There we go, that's one, Jerma.
[113:35.08]Okay.
[113:35.52]Yeah, I can count.
[113:36.20]Aiming a little low, aiming a little low.
[113:39.12]Where are you?
[113:40.60]Keep the energy on him.
[113:42.08]Come on.
[113:42.72]Are you camping?
[113:44.06]It's lame to camp.
[113:45.04]He can hear you.
[113:45.90]Why are you camping?
[113:46.76]Because I need my fucking channel.
[113:48.42]Good camp, Jeremiah.
[113:49.62]It's just lame.
[113:50.36]It's just lame.
[113:51.00]And now he can hear us and you fuck it up.
[113:53.04]I see you, Jeremiah.
[113:53.66]I see you.
[113:54.22]This is really cool.
[113:55.10]I saw your cute little butt.
[113:56.70]I'm not on his side.
[113:57.72]I'm just...
[114:09.53]He's made things interesting.
[114:11.63]Focus, focus, focus.
[114:12.57]He's made things interesting.
[114:15.21]Iron begets steel, baby.
[114:16.65]I've always said that.
[114:18.51]Your butt looks nice in those pants.
[114:21.39]I obviously don't know that thing.
[114:22.65]Is this a bad idea?
[114:25.23]You're lying down in the middle of the same spot.
[114:27.13]There's a lot of openings.
[114:28.89]There's a lot of openings.
[114:30.29]Reduce the amount of entries he could see you at.
[114:33.15]This might fuck him up.
[114:42.14]Thank you so much, Ludwig.
[114:43.18]Wow.
[114:43.66]Are you going to lay down the whole time?
[114:45.84]I'm not going to lay down the whole time.
[114:47.80]I mean, let's go ahead and pound it right there.
[114:50.42]You're not going to lay down again?
[114:52.26]No, not anymore.
[114:53.14]Running gun, running gun.
[114:54.26]Headshot, headshot.
[114:57.56]Walk around a corner.
[114:59.25]Go around a corner?
[114:59.89]Yeah, look at you.
[115:04.04]But I don't know where the hell he is.
[115:05.22]How am I supposed to know that?
[115:05.86]So you have to go around corners safely.
[115:07.83]Ludwig, I don't think you understand that this guy's on my channel right now.
[115:11.27]What is that?
[115:12.01]You don't understand.
[115:12.61]If you fucking lose this game, you don't get your channel back.
[115:14.96]Do you think we don't understand?
[115:16.04]Yes, the channel.
[115:16.86]I'm thinking of calling the channel The Extinguisher.
[115:19.58]Everyone in this building knows where.
[115:21.54]Twitch is not going to let you change my name to The Extinguisher.
[115:24.16]I'm going to change it to The Extinguisher 986.
[115:27.54]He's actually pulling a lot of numbers.
[115:28.84]I've actually seen his viewership.
[115:31.38]It went up since you were on.
[115:32.64]How many viewers does he have on that channel?
[115:33.96]Not many.
[115:34.18]He's got like
[115:34.74]$50,000.
[115:34.86]$400 million.
[115:36.69]There are 50,000.
[115:37.41]How many people are actually on that channel?
[115:38.87]He's like a 30, 40k Andy.
[115:40.09]He's big.
[115:40.85]Like, actually, I'm asking if he wants to do an off-brand.
[115:43.07]Oh.
[115:43.45]Oh.
[115:49.04]That's it, that's it.
[115:51.06]It's the first of five, the first of five.
[115:52.52]You're hitting me a little hard.
[115:55.44]It is a flaw you have, yeah.
[115:56.81]He does it a lot in the game too.
[115:59.37]Wow.
[116:00.21]First of five kills?
[116:01.05]It's first of five and we got two rounds, three rounds.
[116:03.23]Come on, tighten up then, tighten up.
[116:04.61]Two more kills.
[116:05.72]Two more.
[116:06.20]Two more kills.
[116:06.78]Maybe reload, maybe reload.
[116:08.02]What?
[116:09.10]Reload.
[116:09.78]Oh, I thought it automatically did that.
[116:11.66]No, you're still not reloaded.
[116:12.90]What are you talking about?
[116:14.20]I pressed R, it didn't make any sense.
[116:16.34]You run canceled it.
[116:17.48]That's all good, that's all good.
[116:18.42]What are you doing?
[116:19.20]I'm stuck.
[116:19.58]You are shooting the bag and you are, okay.
[116:23.14]Alright.
[116:26.79]Hey, hacker.
[116:27.55]Hey, extinguisher.
[116:28.91]Yeah?
[116:30.51]Hey, are you playing with a controller?
[116:38.87]And don't do don't do this when you're talking shit First of five you don't leave there three to three
[117:02.94]Drop on him, drop on him, drop on him, drop on him.
[117:04.44]You know where he is.
[117:05.10]Okay, what are you doing?
[117:05.96]What are you doing?
[117:06.88]What are you doing?
[117:08.64]This thing sucks.
[117:09.60]Tight down, tight down, tight down.
[117:11.75]Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down, slow it down.
[117:13.75]Everybody quiet in the room.
[117:30.05]Shit, I didn't want to press the button.
[117:32.91]Get away from the bus, Jerma.
[117:35.07]What, don't go near the bus?
[117:36.29]Stay away from the bus.
[117:37.21]Dude, stop walking around the bus.
[117:39.61]Dude, the bus is, yeah, I should hide under the bus to be able to find when he walks by, right?
[117:44.14]No, it's a bad idea.
[117:45.48]Oh, you're doing it, though.
[117:46.46]You're doing it no matter what we say.
[117:47.94]It's alright, though.
[117:49.04]It doesn't matter.
[117:50.12]Man, if he came from behind the bus right now.
[117:53.64]And aimed only at the bus.
[117:55.02]He would kill you.
[118:05.14]You're adorable.
[118:05.94]Oh, that went down my entire body.
[118:08.36]I need one more kill and that's it.
[118:10.32]One more, one more for the channel.
[118:11.90]One more, one more.
[118:12.82]Come on, this is for the channel.
[118:13.86]One more, come on, baby.
[118:15.02]Are you nervous?
[118:15.74]Tighten up, tighten up.
[118:16.70]Are you nervous?
[118:17.78]Tighten up.
[118:18.48]Oh, the extinguisher's coming for me, is that what you're saying?
[118:20.80]The extinguisher is, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[118:26.03]Oh my fucking God, you fucking idiot, you should've.
[118:29.13]Oh.
[118:29.51]Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[118:31.19]Oh.
[118:33.67]Look at that.
[118:34.17]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[118:35.33]Look at that.
[118:36.36]That's your channel.
[118:38.30]That's your channel.
[118:39.68]That's best of three.
[118:40.68]It's not over yet, best of three.
[118:42.06]It's actually my channel now, isn't it?
[118:44.74]Oh, yeah, best of three.
[118:46.38]Yeah, you want two more chances?
[118:48.10]No, it's best of three.
[118:49.18]You said best of three.
[118:50.42]I didn't say best of three.
[118:51.40]I'll give you best of three.
[118:52.68]You said best out of three.
[118:54.14]I did.
[118:55.00]I did.
[118:56.33]Are you nervous?
[118:57.88]Look at your friends.
[118:58.62]Your friends are all hands on faces.
[119:01.40]Why do I not have the headset on?
[119:02.92]They don't look like the beach boys anymore.
[119:05.08]They look like the beach bums.
[119:08.74]Look at them.
[119:09.79]Go, go, go, go, go.
[119:11.51]I'm ready.
[119:11.81]I'm ready.
[119:12.51]I don't know what to do.
[119:13.43]Go, go.
[119:16.05]Oh, he's missing.
[119:17.39]Wait a minute.
[119:17.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[119:18.45]Back in, back in.
[119:19.09]Hey, we're back in.
[119:19.79]Back in.
[119:20.13]You can do this.
[119:20.95]I cannot hear anything you guys are saying, by the way.
[119:23.04]These are noise-canceling headphones.
[119:24.32]We are fucked.
[119:26.21]Look at him praying behind you.
[119:27.63]He's shitting at video games.
[119:28.41]They're worried.
[119:28.99]I know, I know.
[119:29.95]They're worried.
[119:31.57]Is this a good loadout?
[119:32.81]Yeah, good.
[119:34.00]Good.
[119:34.80]Good?
[119:35.28]You think this is good?
[119:36.00]Okay.
[119:36.42]Keep it up.
[119:37.40]Do you think the hacker... It'll take a deal.
[119:39.76]A deal?
[119:39.96]We could hit him up.
[119:41.68]Yeah, he does like a... I think...
[119:43.52]We could sign him.
[119:45.08]He's got charisma.
[119:45.96]He's got charisma.
[119:48.06]He's a charmer.
[119:49.24]I'm walking this way.
[119:50.22]I like what I like about him is he seems like he'll stand by what he promises.
[119:56.19]Right.
[119:57.19]And I think that's like what a sponsor wants.
[119:59.39]Right.
[119:59.83]Yeah.
[120:00.09]Okay.
[120:00.97]You got it, baby.
[120:01.89]Hey.
[120:02.35]What's up?
[120:02.69]Keep it up, kid.
[120:03.17]You got it.
[120:03.93]Alright.
[120:05.59]What was that?
[120:06.37]I thought you gave me the finger.
[120:08.01]No, no, no.
[120:08.39]It was like a thumbs up.
[120:09.21]Hey, Extinguisher, deal with this one, bud.
[120:14.07]Yeah, flashing into it.
[120:15.73]Yeah.
[120:17.23]Well, I like that you're calling me extinguisher.
[120:19.81]Well, I don't know your name.
[120:20.85]It's the only thing you said.
[120:21.79]You know my name.
[120:24.17]You drained my bank account, too?
[120:26.17]Wait, what was he over there?
[120:28.75]Although I've heard you're two billion in debt.
[120:32.22]That's fucking bullshit.
[120:33.66]He's got host advantage, probably.
[120:35.30]Yeah.
[120:41.04]By the way, I can hear every single thing you guys have said.
[120:47.72]Let's go, Jerma!
[120:48.36]Let's go, Big J!
[120:49.16]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma,
[121:18.21]Press Q. Q?
[121:19.63]Q. Cheeks be clapping.
[121:21.05]What's that?
[121:22.53]What the hell is... What was that?
[121:24.21]Ludwig, what the hell was that?
[121:25.29]Try E. Try E. E?
[121:30.27]Yeah, I think you have to... Is this a grenade?
[121:33.29]I think so.
[121:33.99]I think you have to release it, though.
[121:36.09]You think so?
[121:37.38]I don't know.
[121:37.98]It just was on... Use your eyes.
[121:40.28]I just saw the bottom right.
[121:41.28]It's wholly a grenade.
[121:42.34]But the icon doesn't look like a grenade.
[121:43.82]It could be like a Molotov.
[121:45.30]Yeah, it's just... Shh, I hear him.
[121:55.16]Come into the room in the back near the car.
[121:57.50]Hey, extinguisher, if you come into the room with a guy with a point and a gun at the camera.
[122:05.91]Son of a goddamn.
[122:08.91]I need to get one kill.
[122:11.01]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[122:12.75]Come on.
[122:13.43]Come on, baby.
[122:14.83]Are your palms sweaty?
[122:16.81]No, they're actually very dry.
[122:18.40]Thanks for asking, though.
[122:19.68]Your lips?
[122:20.22]I can help.
[122:21.16]Yeah, thank you.
[122:23.65]Is it because you smushed the war paint, do you think?
[122:25.57]Could I reapply it?
[122:29.99]Put it over there and don't do it again.
[122:32.39]You're back, Lenny.
[122:33.47]Come back.
[122:35.19]Come back, season.
[122:37.45]Come back, season.
[122:39.83]Holiday spirit.
[122:40.97]That's what we need right now.
[122:43.57]Stop touching me so I can focus.
[122:48.63]I am fun!
[122:49.39]I was talking about someone else.
[122:50.33]I am fun!
[123:00.60]Oh Jerma.
[123:06.60]Oh Jerma oh oh.
[123:11.22]I want everybody else out of the room.
[123:13.32]Welcome to my channel, the Extinguisher 986.
[123:19.43]Go to break.
[123:19.95]Just go to the ads.
[123:25.79]Go to the ads.
[127:06.13]Thank you.
[127:41.51]What a disaster.
[127:45.45]Oh, do a fun holiday show, and at least we still have some other stuff to do, but it's just so frustrating knowing that, like, I'm sitting up there trying to just keep it together and do the awards, and this extinguisher, I kind of don't know what to do.
[128:03.30]I could have been doing more awards if I need to, but it's just so fucking annoying.
[128:09.03]I'm sorry for Buddy Vig, he's supposed to be like, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.
[128:11.71]What is that?
[128:16.94]No, no, he can't do it.
[128:18.24]No, no, no, he can't do that.
[128:20.50]No, no, no, no, stop that, stop that.
[128:22.38]Can you get me into, pump me in, pump me in.
[128:25.23]Does he know?
[128:25.71]I don't think he knows.

[129:27.98]I didn't do anything.
[129:28.66]What did you do on websites where you are?

[129:53.37]I don't have any of my spell books.
[129:55.73]I came to make a holiday dinner.
[129:59.15]Yes, I know.
[130:00.53]You told me to leave all of my things at home.
[130:04.47]You said, don't bring the spell book.
[130:05.68]You don't need it.
[130:06.68]So it's not here.
[130:07.50]So what do you want me to do?
[130:09.33]You're improvised.
[130:11.11]Can you do anything?
[130:12.13]Maybe cast a spell, anything?
[130:13.57]I don't know what you can bring me.
[130:19.77]I'm sorry, dude.
[130:21.03]I'm so sorry.
[130:25.46]I told you, yeah, do make a turkey, but... Yes.
[130:31.28]The channel has been compromised.
[130:32.58]A hacker hacked the channel.
[130:34.46]If you could do anything you can to help... Engineers are useless, by the way.
[130:39.42]I'm sorry, but you are.
[130:41.54]What are you doing?
[130:43.66]I'm going to do what I can, gentlemen.
[130:45.14]Just hold on.
[130:45.74]Hold tight.
[130:46.32]OK.
[130:46.60]Thank you so much, dude.
[130:47.90]You have no idea what this means.
[130:48.84]I'll make it up to you.
[130:49.36]I promise.
[130:49.70]No, that's not going to work, gentlemen.
[130:53.62]This is not going to work.
[130:54.44]Oh, come and do this.
[130:56.15]What are you doing?
[130:56.79]I don't get to do anything I want to do.
[130:59.81]OK.
[131:00.21]Alright.
[131:00.53]So that's ketchup, Bugleberry.
[131:02.87]The same stuff that I did.
[131:04.77]Yeah.
[131:07.03]What is he doing?
[131:09.80]Alright, okay, okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[131:11.62]I don't know what that is, but.
[131:14.06]Everybody, I need you to stand back, and that is production, stand back.
[131:19.72]Everybody watching, please be careful.
[131:21.88]I don't know what could happen here.
[131:23.62]I'm not entirely sure.
[131:25.02]What are you gonna do?
[131:28.13]Alright, don't do anything too weird, though.
[131:31.87]Oh my God.
[131:33.71]Don't do anything too weird.
[131:38.53]You alright?
[131:45.29]What the fuck are you doing?
[131:48.21]That's connected to the toilet.
[131:49.67]That's not even connected.
[131:50.45]That's not connected to anything.
[131:52.01]Oh God.
[131:52.23]Can you feel it?
[131:53.23]Can anybody feel it?
[131:54.33]I can.
[131:56.94]What?
[131:58.42]You need to hold on to something.
[131:59.96]What?
[132:00.30]Okay.
[132:00.76]Alright.
[132:01.02]Alright.
[132:01.30]I'll hold on to something.
[132:01.92]Alright.
[132:02.24]I'm holding on.
[132:03.56]Whoa.
[132:05.00]What is that?
[132:06.70]What is going on?
[132:12.59]What the fuck?
[132:13.75]Hello!
[132:15.71]Oh, yes, how are you?
[132:17.33]Oh, Frank!
[132:18.65]Frank, how are you?
[132:19.51]Good to see you again.
[132:20.43]Jesus!
[132:20.79]Do you want... No!
[132:21.35]Put that down!
[132:22.13]Put that down!
[132:22.63]Don't touch that!
[132:27.86]This is a sacrificial circle, Jerma.
[132:30.94]Precisely what you wanted.
[132:32.64]No.
[132:34.00]What are you willing to give up?
[132:36.46]I'm willing to hear it.
[132:37.98]I'm not... Nothing.
[132:39.34]I don't want to do anything.
[132:42.07]Bugleberry, you could do something else, maybe?
[132:44.01]Do something else.
[132:45.87]Something else.
[132:46.27]What are you talking about?
[132:47.71]Do something else.
[132:48.55]I don't want to do that.
[132:49.13]Don't put the spell back in.
[132:51.80]The spell is here now.
[132:53.46]We need to sacrifice something that you care about very much.
[132:56.64]Dude, I don't... How about the presents under the tree?
[133:00.84]No!
[133:01.76]No.
[133:02.50]We'll sacrifice something else.
[133:05.86]Does a crew member have something that we can put in?
[133:10.82]That's not happening.
[133:11.70]It has to be something that you care about, Jerma.
[133:14.19]Not something that anybody else does.
[133:15.65]Let's go get those presents.
[133:19.07]No, no, no.
[133:20.45]Don't touch those presents.
[133:21.65]It's the only way, Jerma.
[133:22.97]Don't touch those presents.
[133:23.99]Those are my presents.
[133:26.29]Do not touch them.
[133:27.99]No, get out of here.
[133:29.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[133:30.95]Please, please, at least leave a couple.
[133:33.37]I'm taking this one.
[133:33.95]This is my present.
[133:35.49]These are my presents.
[133:37.55]Bugleberry, come on.
[133:38.49]There's got to be something else you can do besides this.
[133:42.16]Don't listen to him.
[133:43.78]Dude, wait, is he still there?
[133:47.90]Bugleberry, wait, stop.
[133:50.12]Stop.
[133:51.08]Can you hear me?
[133:53.46]What the fuck, dude?
[133:54.62]Those are mine.
[133:56.90]I don't even know what's in those.
[134:01.18]Pump me into him.
[134:01.88]Is he still there?
[134:04.30]Bugleberry, can you hear me?
[134:06.58]Don't touch.
[134:07.18]Leave a couple, please.
[134:09.61]Oh, my God.
[134:13.97]I don't want to do this.
[134:14.81]I don't want to do this.
[134:19.45]I don't want to do this.
[134:21.83]Anything else, please!
[134:23.15]Anything else!
[134:24.79]Anything else!
[134:25.35]Gentlemen, there's no going back like I already said.
[134:30.29]And watch this one, you'll see.
[134:32.34]Oh, it's just a new iPhone!
[134:34.38]They get bigger every year.
[134:36.60]Is it an iPhone?
[134:38.36]Jesus!
[134:38.86]Can you hear the screams?
[134:44.11]I can!
[134:44.63]Watch this one!
[134:46.80]Oh, sounds like an Xbox.
[134:48.54]Xbox.
[134:48.90]Doesn't look like an Xbox.
[134:50.36]That's my Xbox.
[134:51.38]Maybe it's not.
[134:53.38]Bugabay, don't put that one in, maybe.
[134:54.64]That's an Xbox.
[135:04.78]That was juicy.
[135:06.52]Oh, my God.
[135:07.30]Oh, a new sweater.
[135:09.94]Is this possibly a sweater?
[135:12.06]Oh, what size are you, Jerma?
[135:13.38]Maybe I could wear it.
[135:14.32]I'm a medium.
[135:15.90]I'm a medium.
[135:16.96]I'm going in.
[135:17.58]I'm going in there.
[135:18.90]I'm going in.
[135:20.82]I'm going in.
[135:22.32]Let me in.
[135:23.15]Fucking come on.
[135:26.85]Get off of me.
[135:28.35]He must stick with it.
[135:35.03]two-part DVD.
[135:36.21]Oh, no, this might be Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation 1, his favorite game.
[135:41.54]That game sucks.
[135:42.12]I don't care.
[135:42.58]Put that one in.
[135:44.76]Put that one in.
[135:45.28]I don't care.
[135:46.48]That's probably the only one I don't care about.
[135:47.66]What's this?
[135:48.82]What's this one?
[135:51.44]What is it?
[135:51.76]This one's making noise, Jarvo.
[135:53.58]What's in it?
[135:54.25]Oh, gosh.
[135:54.85]You don't want me to put it in?
[135:56.05]Don't put it in.
[135:56.81]Don't put this one in.
[135:57.45]Don't put that one in.
[135:58.15]Leave me one present, Bugleberry.
[135:59.51]Please.
[136:00.29]One present.
[136:00.83]This one here.
[136:01.93]Thank you.
[136:02.97]Thank God I get one.
[136:09.30]Jesus.
[136:13.78]I have no idea, I just feel sick.
[136:15.30]I don't know.
[136:18.66]What should I be feeling?
[136:19.54]What are you doing?
[136:30.99]Okay.
[136:32.63]Two points, yeah, Buber, I feel fucking sick.
[136:38.30]What was it?
[136:41.76]Bugleberry, something's wrong.
[136:45.14]How do you feel?
[136:49.99]What the fuck was that?
[136:52.51]Bugleberry, stop!
[136:54.07]Stop, stop it right, please stop!
[137:00.48]I don't even know what's happening!
[137:04.68]Ow, my chest hurts!
[137:06.91]My chest hurts.
[137:08.55]Is it even doing anything?
[137:09.83]I don't think it's doing anything.
[137:12.75]I don't think it's working.
[137:21.27]I don't know.
[137:22.05]I don't think so.
[137:22.89]Maybe.
[137:23.31]I don't.
[137:27.08]Nothing's happening.
[137:27.94]I don't think it's happening.
[137:29.58]No.
[137:37.36]You know what?
[137:37.98]Fine.
[137:38.78]You want power, you want magical history, I'll give it to you.
[137:45.32]No!
[137:45.44]Stop!
[137:45.60]They all have to go in now, Colonel!
[137:49.45]What is this?
[137:50.01]An awful tunnel!
[137:52.45]What's this?
[137:53.21]A new box of chocolates!
[137:56.13]Whatever it was, it doesn't matter!
[137:59.73]It doesn't go in, Colonel!
[138:02.11]Oh!
[138:02.87]Oh!
[138:05.07]Whoa!
[138:06.15]Don't ask me for anything ever again.
[138:08.38]And by the way, if you invite somebody to a party and you tell them to do something, make sure it's what you actually say and not this bull crap.
[138:15.54]And I don't want to swear that I just did.
[138:17.72]Dude, easy on the language, please, but... Oh, no.
[138:19.92]Bugleberry!
[138:20.42]No, no.
[138:21.78]Are you okay?
[138:22.17]I don't want to go with my grandmother.
[138:25.65]No!
[138:27.11]Oh, no.
[138:29.31]Oh!
[138:36.65]What the fuck just happened?
[138:37.70]What happened?
[138:38.54]What happened?
[138:41.24]What's going on?
[138:43.06]Hey.
[138:45.54]You piece of shit.
[138:46.96]It's you.
[138:47.90]It's you.
[138:48.54]You motherfucker.
[138:49.60]I see you now.
[138:50.26]You mother blubber.
[138:51.38]I see you.
[138:52.42]I can see you.
[138:52.80]I see you.
[138:54.57]What do I do about this?
[138:55.78]What do I do?
[138:57.12]What do I do?
[138:57.82]What do I do?
[138:58.82]What do I do?
[138:59.66]Oh, now you're scared?
[139:00.80]That's where I had it.
[139:01.72]I had a magician.
[139:02.62]I have a guy.
[139:03.40]I know a guy.
[139:04.20]You know hacking.
[139:05.50]I got dark magic, motherfucker, and I come for you now.
[139:08.80]What did you do?
[139:09.48]What did you do?
[139:13.08]What is that?
[139:13.92]What is...
[139:15.50]What is that?
[139:16.56]I know we don't really know each other, and this is really strange.
[139:19.86]It's really weird, everything going on.
[139:20.94]But is your room cold right now?
[139:22.78]It's very cold.
[139:24.54]My nips are... Yeah.
[139:26.33]Do you see what is under here?
[139:31.03]Yes.
[139:31.99]I have something down here.
[139:33.75]I don't know what this is.
[139:34.69]It's a swirling thing.
[139:36.19]Do you have one of those in your room, dude?
[139:38.19]Yeah.
[139:39.43]Yes.
[139:40.27]Okay.
[139:41.81]I don't, um, I'll be honest, this is kind of freaking me out.
[139:44.65]I know Bugleberry, hopefully Bugleberry's okay.
[139:47.53]Do we call someone?
[139:48.81]I don't know, man, hold on, let me... Let me put my hand in here.
[139:52.12]Don't, don't, uh... Can you... What the... Ow, don't, ow!
[139:57.64]Ow!
[139:57.90]God!
[139:58.12]Was that you?
[140:00.00]Was that you?
[140:00.46]Was that you?
[140:01.58]Was that you?
[140:05.23]I don't know.
[140:05.93]Did it feel like someone slapped your hand?
[140:07.79]It felt like somebody touched my finger, like in the middle of something, somebody slapped my hand.
[140:10.43]Was that, you touched me?
[140:12.21]That was, that was me.
[140:15.39]Man, you motherfucker!
[140:16.59]Come here!
[140:18.07]How does that feel, huh?
[140:19.69]Does that feel weird?
[140:20.96]Does that feel weird?
[140:21.86]Does it?
[140:22.76]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[140:25.26]Stop, stop, stop, stop!
[140:26.18]God damn it!
[140:28.90]You don't choke me!
[140:30.52]Alright, man, you wanna fuck around?
[140:32.48]How does this, what does this sound?
[140:34.48]Don't, don't, don't you?
[140:35.96]I'm going to kick you in the goddamn face.
[140:37.59]How does that sound?
[140:40.25]Don't you?
[140:42.47]Ow, ow, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.
[140:45.17]Ow, let go, let go, let go, let go.
[140:46.19]Put it back, put it back, put it back.
[140:50.85]What is wrong with you?
[140:53.19]Those were nice kids, by the way.
[140:54.71]Yeah, they are nice shoes.
[140:56.52]I'm glad you like them.
[140:57.56]You know what?
[140:59.88]Look at you.
[141:01.12]Hey.
[141:02.44]My camera's all twisted.
[141:03.64]How do you feel about this, you piece of shit?
[141:05.94]It's a piece of wood.
[141:07.00]Yeah, it's a piece of wood.
[141:08.14]It'll knock your fucking teeth out.
[141:09.06]What are you going to do with a piece of wood?
[141:11.06]I'm coming in there and I'm going to knock your head off.
[141:14.52]Hold it right there, boys.
[141:18.70]Santa!
[141:19.77]This has got to stop.
[141:21.61]This is not the Christmas spirit.
[141:25.41]What?
[141:26.98]Santa.
[141:27.57]What is this?
[141:29.01]You've got a, you've, does a. Jerma, young man, get over here.
[141:32.61]What do you mean, there's a Santa here?
[141:35.62]I mean, that's kind of funny, there's a. Jerma.
[141:38.64]There was nobody here before.
[141:42.12]Put that stick down.
[141:44.66]What?
[141:45.80]I remember the last time you used that stick.
[141:49.74]It's real.
[141:50.42]It's him.
[141:51.39]It's really him.
[141:52.15]That's the real Santa.
[141:52.91]That's the real Santa.
[141:53.85]Dude, bro, this is the real Santa, I think.
[141:55.61]You cannot have any more of this.
[141:58.57]You are ruining Christmas with your dark magic and your foul mouth.
[142:04.02]I'm, I don't know what to say, but I mean, the magic was not me.
[142:10.14]I hired somebody to come and hang out.
[142:12.18]I don't know what to say.
[142:13.65]Well, my magicometer sensed it all the way from the North Pole that something was not right in this place, and I've come to set the Christmas spirit right again.
[142:23.17]Okay, okay.
[142:24.47]But that's gonna require change on both of your parts.
[142:28.99]Okay.
[142:30.82]What do you mean?
[142:31.86]What do you want us to do?
[142:33.18]I want you to reconcile as brothers.
[142:36.36]I want an apology from both of you.
[142:39.08]And we're going to start with Extinguisher.
[142:42.32]With me, Santa?
[142:43.88]Yes, you get the chance to go first to be nice and to apologize to this little boy.
[142:50.03]I've never grown, man.
[142:52.11]Well, when you put it like that.
[142:56.10]I'm sorry, Jerma, for hacking your stream and playing the best game of Call of Duty that I've ever put on board.
[143:05.51]Yeah.
[143:07.59]My bad.
[143:08.93]Anything else?
[143:11.37]You're not.
[143:13.21]I really do like your butt cheeks.
[143:16.36]There's no place for that here, Extinguisher.
[143:18.82]Thank you.
[143:19.14]It was a compliment, Santa, but you're right.
[143:24.65]Well, I mean, Santa, he hacked my... Time to apologize.
[143:28.53]He hacked my channel and he tried to... Excuses.
[143:32.44]He wiped out my bank account and he hacked the channel and it ruined my Christmas show and it was really kind of annoying and... Selfishness.
[143:39.58]Doesn't sound like an apology.
[143:40.97]No, it's not.
[143:43.81]Extinguisher, I am sorry that I called you a dork.
[143:49.04]I said that your hacking abilities weren't very good.
[143:51.44]I mean, you seem like kind of a nice guy.
[143:52.96]And you seem like pretty cool.
[143:56.28]So I'm sorry.
[143:58.34]Really?
[143:59.62]Yeah.
[144:00.98]Is that sincere, young man?
[144:03.50]Yeah.
[144:04.16]And I also maybe want to say sorry to the crew.
[144:07.62]I think I was a little mean earlier.
[144:09.00]I've just been under a lot of stress.
[144:11.66]And... Stress?
[144:12.86]Stress.
[144:14.19]And who else do you need to apologize to?
[144:17.35]Um... Maybe my mother, because she thought I was going to be a doctor and I ended up being a clown on the Internet.
[144:23.25]But, I mean, still doing pretty well.
[144:25.54]And, uh, sorry, Mom.
[144:26.72]I think that covers it.
[144:29.40]Anyone else, Jeremiah?
[144:35.14]Oh, right, the two by four.
[144:38.20]I'm sorry, Santa, for, I didn't know, how am I supposed to know?
[144:42.75]Excuses.
[144:44.21]But how am I supposed to know that it was you?
[144:46.17]I didn't mean to hit you with that, I'm sorry.
[144:49.35]Spit it out.
[144:50.17]I'm very sorry to everybody.
[144:52.21]Okay, well that's what I like to hear.
[144:55.31]And Santa likes when you make nice.
[144:58.38]Thank you, this is very big.
[145:00.30]You're welcome.
[145:02.02]That's a big candy cane.
[145:03.22]And now, now that we have reconciliation here, I can finally grant you your Christmas wishes.
[145:12.54]You've been so nice, Extinguisher.
[145:15.62]What would you like for Christmas?
[145:19.04]Dude, you got a Christmas wish, dude.
[145:20.56]What are you gonna do?
[145:21.96]Oh, um, oh, I got it.
[145:26.48]Can you please, please make me silver in League of Legends?
[145:33.12]It's about time you got out of bronze.
[145:34.78]Yeah.
[145:37.29]Wow!
[145:37.67]Did you get it?
[145:40.07]There you go.
[145:41.05]Silver!
[145:42.39]Whoa!
[145:42.69]You're welcome, little boy.
[145:46.23]It worked?
[145:46.97]Did you actually silver?
[145:48.43]Yeah.
[145:49.03]Dude, that's sick.
[145:50.81]So sick.
[145:51.73]Wow.
[145:53.09]And now for you, Jeremiah.
[145:55.24]Money.
[145:56.62]Oh, that's a good one.
[145:57.50]Greed.
[145:57.86]$10 million at least.
[145:58.94]Wow.
[146:01.12]Okay.
[146:01.52]Try again.
[146:04.28]I wish for the things to kind of go back to normal, the way they were before Extinguisher came on and hacked.
[146:13.10]I'd like to do the rest of my awards and just chill and have a good time.
[146:17.42]The way things should have been had you been nice.
[146:21.05]That's true.
[146:22.25]Ho, ho, ho!
[146:23.23]You're right.
[146:23.55]Santa can do that.
[146:27.13]Whoa!
[146:29.02]Didn't work?
[146:30.24]How do you feel?
[146:30.92]I feel great.
[146:32.28]Do you?
[146:32.98]I feel jiggly inside.
[146:35.20]Dude, hey, how about this?
[146:37.40]I'll take you to lunch.
[146:39.10]What?
[146:40.28]I got at least 10 minutes on Friday if you want to hang out.
[146:43.64]I got 15 minutes on Friday.
[146:44.92]Wow.
[146:47.26]Yeah.
[146:48.06]I've got an hour on Friday.
[146:50.20]Minimum.
[146:51.02]Oh, that calls for a real sit-down restaurant.
[146:53.76]You like Ruby Tuesdays?
[146:55.13]Yeah, let's do it.
[146:57.50]Alright, you and me are going to go.
[147:00.36]It's good to see you playing nice together again.
[147:02.88]Thank you.
[147:04.32]Thank you.
[147:05.22]Thank you.
[147:05.76]Bye-bye.
[147:07.37]Santa, thank you so much.
[147:09.49]That was unbelievable.
[147:10.91]Bye, everyone.
[147:12.25]The power of Christmas.
[147:14.71]Yeah.
[147:15.17]And the right magic.
[147:16.35]Not that dark stuff.
[147:17.78]You can never go back to that again.
[147:19.52]Well, I think Buleberry might be dead, or he's gone.
[147:22.76]I have no idea where he is, but we might not see him for a long time.
[147:27.64]And remember, the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.
[147:31.99]It's true.
[147:33.09]So keep changing that.
[147:35.21]And to all the community out there, I want to remind you that this is the season for giving and forgiving.
[147:44.57]And a Merry Christmas to all!
[147:48.73]Thank you, Santa, seriously.
[147:50.41]Hey, and Extinguisher, I'm serious, we should go hang out.
[147:55.30]I'm sorry, I didn't, it is the spirit for giving.
[147:58.16]It is the spirit for reconciliation and hanging out and having a good time.
[148:04.81]Holy fucking shit, what a disaster.
[148:08.39]What was that?
[148:09.45]I meant to say Merry Christmas to all and to all have a very good evening and to all good night and Merry Christmas too.
[148:17.37]Ho ho ho ho!
[148:18.43]And to all a good night!
[148:19.89]Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
[148:23.63]Wow.
[148:30.32]Are we on the channel?
[148:31.40]Are we on my channel now?
[148:34.62]Are we good?
[148:38.77]I'm so sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but sometimes it takes the spirit of Christmas.
[148:42.91]Sometimes it takes Santa Claus to come out and right the wrongs.
[148:48.61]Ladies and gentlemen, we are not done.
[148:51.14]We are now on the channel.
[148:52.98]We have control.
[148:54.68]We're, in fact, just getting started.
[148:56.90]So let's go into our next category.
[148:59.36]This is category number 11, by the way.
[149:02.72]There are a lot more to do.
[149:05.05]So, this is best rant, and there's some spillage here, and I'm gonna need production to maybe help me eventually after this category.
[149:16.58]Right?
[149:16.96]I'm not gonna say any bad words.
[149:19.10]I'm not gonna yell at anybody.
[149:21.20]Production, I spilled some cocoa earlier, and I may need a little bit of help to clean it up.
[149:29.22]How's that sound?
[149:30.78]There we are.
[149:32.00]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's do this category.
[149:33.63]This is Best Rant of the Year.
[149:35.73]Here are your nominees.
[149:37.41]Thank you, Santa, for fixing everything.
[149:48.43]It's just, I get exhausted.
[149:49.99]I can't, my brain goes like, alright, man, that's enough.
[149:52.49]No humans are supposed to be doing this.
[149:55.17]You know what fucking humans are supposed to be doing?
[149:57.43]Humans are supposed to be fucking picking up like a wheelbarrow full of like logs and just like slowly walking with it and delivering those logs to the community.
[150:07.62]And then like those logs are used to build houses.
[150:09.88]And then there's also like a baker and like a butcher.
[150:12.38]No humans aren't supposed to be doing what we're doing right now.
[150:15.79]Humans aren't supposed to be doing this.
[150:17.57]Guys, when Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn fucking Declaration of Independence,
[150:22.49]There was no guggity guggity in there.
[150:24.75]There was no... Oh, yeah.
[150:25.77]We also need to make sure to leave some room for guggity guggity guggity guggity guggity guggity.
[150:30.53]There's no room for that, Ben.
[150:32.23]Goat cheese is so gross.
[150:34.53]Goat cheese is fucking vile.
[150:36.31]I... Honest to God, I feel like everybody that eats... People pretend to like goat cheese.
[150:40.50]You pretend to like it.
[150:42.26]I'm so serious.
[150:43.42]I will die on this hill.
[150:45.14]Goat cheese does not... It tastes like dirt.
[150:47.18]Goat cheese is this immediate.
[150:49.70]E-mediate.
[150:51.22]Like...
[150:53.24]flavor it's it's like right when it touches your lip it's just like oh what's on this it's like it's immediately oh goat cheese bro I love it oh dude I would I'll eat a ton of it on a cracker of course I will yeah right
[151:12.20]What if aliens don't have anything?
[151:14.21]Aliens could just be like, oh, wow, you have this thing over here that keeps your food from spoiling?
[151:20.31]Well, on our planet, fructose, we have, we got stuff.
[151:29.26]What's that over there?
[151:31.00]wait oh it's a calendar what's that you keep track of days who knows guys the fact that you can have sounds come out of your mouth might be the most absurd thing that they've ever heard hi Mr. alien how are you and their heads are going to explode exactly what I told you was going to happen what what is this
[151:56.07]WHAT IS THIS?
[151:57.17]WHY DOES THIS EXIST?
[151:58.47]THIS IS MAGIC POWERS!
[152:00.93]The game's fucking easy.
[152:03.21]It's not even a hard game.
[152:04.23]Instant kill moves are stupid.
[152:05.29]Delete them.
[152:06.11]Patch them out of the game.
[152:06.79]Instant kill moves are fucking... Delete them from the game.
[152:08.38]Instant kill moves, you should never have to put those in the game.
[152:10.36]They're fucking stupid.
[152:11.10]Nobody likes them.
[152:11.72]Nobody, not one person likes them.
[152:12.86]Your health is just too low.
[152:13.78]He doesn't have any instant kill moves.
[152:16.30]Okay.
[152:17.16]If I... If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball...
[152:25.81]You're probably dead.
[152:27.81]You're probably going to... Not you, I'm just saying.
[152:30.99]Like, I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder.
[152:34.78]I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder.
[152:37.44]Okay, we're going to take humans out of this.
[152:39.94]If AlienGlobGlobGlobGo1... Fucking shoots a disintegrating ray at AlienGlobGlo2...
[152:50.54]If there's only fucking teeth left, it's fucking, you're dead.
[152:55.22]You're dead.
[152:56.70]I've run my dishwasher because otherwise it'll get gross.
[153:02.27]I wash by hand.
[153:05.23]I don't like that idea.
[153:06.23]Oh yeah, there's like a bunch of fucking like saucer and like mess on my plate.
[153:11.31]Just stick it in here and turn the water on.
[153:12.79]No, I don't like the dishwasher.
[153:15.32]I don't like it.
[153:15.96]And you know why also I don't like the dishwasher?
[153:18.77]all the people question-marking me right now.
[153:21.16]So you enjoy putting, like, your dishes in this thing, and then, like, for, like, at least one to two fucking hours, you hear...
[153:37.28]it's fucking obnoxious it's obnoxious and it lasts for an hour an hour two fucking hours of this 23 there are more hungry animals back there freddy and that's scary number I like that number 23 hold on
[153:52.39]The scary thriller Jim Carrey movie, the number 23, is not based on any actual real folklore.
[154:01.12]I am not fucking around.
[154:02.72]I'm telling you the absolute honest to God truth.
[154:04.76]I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie and stuff.
[154:07.40]I don't know, man.
[154:08.00]How old was I?
[154:08.72]When did that movie come out?
[154:10.60]Like 20 fucking years ago?
[154:12.45]How old was I?
[154:13.69]I was probably like, I don't know.
[154:16.01]I don't know how old I was.
[154:17.01]I probably was very influenced.
[154:18.99]You were 23.
[154:24.75]What?
[154:25.61]2 divided by 3 is 666.
[154:26.39]That's what I'm saying, sir.
[154:28.75]What do you mean question marks?
[154:31.53]Yeah, it's an actually biblically accurate scary number.
[154:35.74]I don't want the afterlife to be like this.
[154:39.31]Every time people think of the afterlife, oh, heaven.
[154:41.32]Oh, my God, I'm moving on.
[154:43.06]They're floating as a specter.
[154:45.48]Oh, wow.
[154:47.90]Look at it.
[154:48.36]So Elizabeth's mist everywhere.
[154:49.81]Everything's misty and you're floating.
[154:51.77]No, I don't want to be like this.
[154:53.31]I don't want to meet the caveman ancestor.
[154:57.47]They're all going to be there.
[155:00.56]I think we all think of, like, oh, Grandpa and Grandpa.
[155:05.18]And, like, Ooga.
[155:06.90]And Ooga is going to be there.
[155:09.70]I don't want to go to hell either because guess what?
[155:13.05]You know there's going to be somebody there that's going to be like, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[155:18.15]Everything, man.
[155:18.71]I'm glad to be down here.
[155:20.01]I don't want to be with the one, like, distant great, great, great uncle that went to hell and hang out with him every day.
[155:27.19]Oh, that's going to be fun.
[155:28.89]Guys.
[155:31.35]Why is there... Why is there not an option?
[155:35.44]Should I even do this?
[155:36.42]I feel like everyone's waiting for me to do this.
[155:38.52]Okay, I'll do it in one sentence instead of like 25 sentences.
[155:43.12]So we're going to do that in one sentence instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I mean by this.
[155:48.12]There is no add to cart option when you're trying to buy shit on Origin for The Sims.
[155:54.17]There's like a hundred things to buy individually.
[155:57.21]I got texted by my bank.
[155:59.19]Hey, we've declined purchases.
[156:00.39]There's like all these like fraudulent purchases going through the EA store.
[156:04.15]Like, no, that's me.
[156:05.63]That's me, and it's dumb.
[156:06.99]You have to go through the checkout process on each individual... Oh, one sentence.
[156:11.85]Shit.
[156:12.11]Fuck.
[156:13.70]I'm sorry.
[156:23.76]I tend to go off the rails.
[156:26.34]And that's not... I don't know.
[156:28.20]I get on a topic, and I just don't stop.
[156:31.16]And people clip it, and then they send it away...
[156:34.52]So ladies and gentlemen, your winner for the best rant of 2022 is... It wasn't even close.
[156:53.97]At 54.7%, 55% is the meat grinder.
[156:57.25]The meat grinder, and then humans are not supposed to be doing this at 17.6.
[157:00.09]Alien panic at 9.1.
[157:05.21]It wasn't even close.
[157:08.44]Look, the meat, okay, let me defend myself.
[157:12.01]The meat grinder category, the meat grinder rant was,
[157:17.98]One person said something, and I was pretending like they were... It's a made-up person, right?
[157:24.84]This person doesn't exist.
[157:26.19]When I say you, I'm talking about you in general.
[157:29.61]Not you watching right now.
[157:31.81]You in general.
[157:33.49]You in general.
[157:35.31]It's not a... Oh, I'm going to put you in a meat... No, I'm not... People are going to clip that too.
[157:39.98]So I'm just going to stop talking.
[157:43.00]When I say you, I mean just you in general, just you.
[157:46.24]Oh, you know, if I put you into a meat grinder, I'm not saying you individually, you get it, you understand.
[157:52.51]Moving right along.
[157:54.91]Now, here come the juicy ones.
[157:58.51]These are the juicy ones.
[158:00.37]There's so many categories left, we just got started.
[158:04.15]I tend to do impressions and some of them are very good, some of them are very bad.
[158:09.42]I think some of my impressions are good.
[158:11.75]Although people would tell me to do your impressions.
[158:13.37]Your impressions are terrible.
[158:15.15]So we'll start with the best.
[158:16.96]We'll go to the worst after.
[158:18.20]This is the best impressions.
[158:22.28]I think I did a pretty good job this year.
[158:25.42]This category, I mean, people are doing that emote and I can see it.
[158:28.26]They're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[158:29.37]My head's bobbing around, whatever.
[158:31.79]You guys know what I mean when I say that shit though, right?
[158:34.23]You have to.
[158:36.03]I told Santa I wouldn't swear.
[158:37.71]So I'm gonna say the, what, the shoot.
[158:41.71]So here are your nominees for best impression of the year.
[158:46.73]These are the good ones.
[158:47.41]At least I hope they are.
[158:54.80]Now, make haste to the tower and defeat the evil witches.
[159:00.66]Mermaid man.
[159:01.44]Evil witches.
[159:07.10]No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.
[159:14.53]What are you doing, you old moron?
[159:17.53]I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing.
[159:23.71]Getting to the bank.
[159:26.19]And who could forget getting it off there?
[159:29.63]The all-knowing... There he is.
[159:36.06]You drink?
[159:41.18]orange-blue chieftain of the Badlands, the ever-knowing gold bass, the disgusting Dung Eater, and of course, this sick idiot off there, the all-knowing... What's happening, my friend?
[160:01.81]I would have voted for that one.
[160:03.77]Meat, potatoes, and lettuce and fucking gravy.
[160:13.49]spinach and radishes and I'm alive and I'm human I like to eat too and I like to have children I'm here and I'm coming I'm here and I'm coming it's like oh patty the platypus I'm going to take over the entire world patty
[160:36.15]No, it's Mendovich.
[160:37.23]But that was actually really, really good.
[160:38.65]And I would say that was probably the best one you've heard anybody do.
[160:41.63]Not showing anything under arrest.
[160:44.27]I'm underwater.
[160:47.69]Gentlemen, this is Tobacco Receive Manifest.
[160:53.60]Ever look at that headlock there, see?
[160:56.62]That chap over there joined.
[160:58.40]Or by pay us this.
[161:00.28]His local got me on the penis before.
[161:01.92]That's one voice.
[161:06.04]Who wants a kiss?
[161:18.11]Who wants a kiss?
[161:21.27]Tom Scott, this water is electrified.
[161:24.36]It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.
[161:28.86]Oh, Bowser!
[161:33.72]Ah, annoying.
[161:36.72]Oh, boys and girls, it's-a me, Mario.
[161:41.60]Let me tell you something.
[161:43.56]If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.
[161:48.74]You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time, and I said no.
[161:54.52]And he said, Mario, and I said no.
[162:04.21]and that's the bottom line because stone cold said so pretty good they're reading her and then they're going to eat me oh my god remember please can you do a quick uh seinfeld uh routine about the word vast what even is vast what's that supposed to mean vast
[162:32.28]Just say big, just say large, say big.
[162:37.35]Why do we need names for so, why do we have so many names to describe what is effectively big?
[162:49.03]I mean, if you want my vote, I'm voting for Alex Jones.
[162:54.64]I don't think anybody does an Alex Jones like I can.
[162:57.34]I just, I gotta be really honest.
[163:00.23]Find me somebody that can do that as good as I can.
[163:04.52]People usually, you know, they go like this.
[163:06.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[163:07.28]Find me somebody that can do that better than me.
[163:10.32]I don't think you can.
[163:11.92]That's my vote.
[163:12.57]That's what I voted for.
[163:15.27]But your winner of the best impression of the year is
[163:23.56]Of course, it's how petty the platypus, Doofenshmirtz.
[163:26.74]With 30% of the vote, that's a high one.
[163:29.80]Then Alex Jones right behind it.
[163:31.12]16.8, actually not right behind it, pretty far.
[163:36.37]Doofenshmirtz, Alex Jones, Doofenshmirtz, it's a hard word to say.
[163:40.11]And then Democracy Manifest Subtitles at 12.3%.
[163:43.84]Doofenshmirtz takes it.
[163:50.70]I think I can do a pretty good job.
[163:51.98]And now, obviously, I do a lot of these every year.
[163:59.51]And we're not just gonna talk about the good ones.
[164:02.63]We're gonna talk about the bad ones.
[164:05.29]This is the worst impression of the year.
[164:09.10]I don't agree with some of these.
[164:12.32]Let's be real.
[164:13.76]I don't agree with some of these.
[164:15.62]Some of these are a little like, I don't like that character, so I'm just gonna nominate it.
[164:19.96]That's not how this works.
[164:22.56]But just like the bad ones, there are also good ones, like what you just saw.
[164:25.79]Here are your nominees for the worst impression of the entire year.
[164:29.91]Did you do Jack Sparrow?
[164:43.04]Fuck, I'm done.
[164:44.20]My career is over.
[164:45.08]I'm ending my career.
[164:46.20]It's over today.
[164:47.30]Okay, so I got a letter.
[164:49.70]Jerry, when you read this letter, I will already be on the other side of the world.
[164:54.88]I'm sorry about that.
[164:56.34]I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be.
[164:58.96]The rest is up to you.
[165:00.72]Do your best and live a wonderful life.
[165:03.26]You always will.
[165:04.42]That's the worst George I've ever heard.
[165:07.79]It's really not.
[165:08.39]That's what I mean.
[165:12.86]Hey, my name's Toad.
[165:14.30]I've been looking forward to this for quite a long time.
[165:16.36]Golf is more popular than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom.
[165:20.16]Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible?
[165:24.13]But if we want to keep the sport interesting, we need some grand players, you see.
[165:29.97]And I just don't meet folks who can hit the green.
[165:32.27]Oh, whoa, hey.
[165:34.20]That's not even that bad.
[165:35.00]It really isn't.
[165:35.46]This is crazy.
[165:35.84]That's all I had to do was just clear my throat.
[165:38.04]We need some fresh faces on the leaderboard.
[165:44.20]Okay!
[165:44.82]That was bad.
[165:46.88]That was a really bad... I don't know if that was Toad or... I don't know what game that was from, but it was a bad impression.
[165:57.91]Skywalker, I must say, you are... Is that bad?
[166:03.03]It really was one word.
[166:04.93]Elongated.
[166:05.45]Skywalker!
[166:07.61]You sound like the Swedish chef.
[166:10.51]Do we have a Bobby Hill impression?
[166:11.97]I'll try.
[166:13.82]Yeah.
[166:15.57]Hey, Dad, I'm sorry.
[166:17.17]I can't, but I tried.
[166:19.37]What does Cookie Monster sound like?
[166:23.13]It's like, um... What does it sound like?
[166:24.81]It's kind of like... Cookies.
[166:33.52]I love cookies, right?
[166:35.06]Something like that?
[166:36.17]Let me go all in with it and see what happens.
[166:41.24]This cookie is delicious.
[166:43.44]I love cookies.
[166:45.80]That's not, that's not really, really not that good.
[166:49.64]But I mean, it's, how do you even do it?
[166:52.40]Let me try to do a dog.
[166:54.26]Oh, Morty, we gotta be careful.
[166:57.62]Put that, get back in there and we go back in time to shave.
[167:00.88]Actually, it is different.
[167:01.88]Morty, Morty, we gotta be careful.
[167:06.53]Guys, I've never seen all these movies.
[167:07.65]I've never seen them.
[167:08.63]I just know... I know Christopher Lloyd.
[167:09.93]Christopher Lloyd!
[167:11.05]Right?
[167:14.10]His name's Morty, not Marty.
[167:15.54]Marty, not... I just dropped everything.
[167:18.90]Do a Taz impression?
[167:20.68]Not on a sponsor stream.
[167:24.57]Whatever.
[167:24.85]Why not?
[167:29.43]What?
[167:40.36]I was just about to... Okay.
[167:41.52]Tasmania was just about to do that.
[167:44.72]And somebody, like, Hitman style, like, put a fucking piano wire on his neck.
[167:51.59]Patrick?
[167:54.49]Hey, SpongeBob.
[167:55.41]It's me, Patrick.
[167:58.05]Oh, yeah.
[167:58.73]SpongeBob.
[167:59.69]Let's go have an adventure.
[168:01.25]What was wrong with this one?
[168:01.97]Does that sound like him?
[168:03.33]Kind of.
[168:03.77]Yeah, it does.
[168:04.53]Why was this on here?
[168:08.29]Enjoying ourselves.
[168:09.71]Nope.
[168:11.90]Okay, this one sucks.
[168:15.16]This one sucks.
[168:16.64]This is bad.
[168:18.70]Jeez, this one's the worst.
[168:20.64]Does this win?
[168:38.97]Voice is bad.
[168:39.61]Voice is bad.
[168:40.27]Shitty voice.
[168:40.83]Worst voice.
[168:41.39]Does that win?
[168:42.01]I... You want my vote.
[168:49.34]It's that one.
[168:51.80]Look.
[168:53.10]Okay.
[168:54.22]You have to... I am live.
[168:56.94]I don't know how many hours a year.
[168:59.34]But if I'm going to do an impression, sometimes you get shitty ones.
[169:02.67]Sometimes you get duds.
[169:04.61]I don't think the George was bad.
[169:07.29]Oh, that George Costanza was so bad!
[169:09.55]Jerry!
[169:10.57]How?
[169:11.65]Why would that be nominated that many times?
[169:14.37]I think that one was fine.
[169:17.51]Why was that so bad?
[169:19.25]Question marks.
[169:19.73]That sucked.
[169:21.60]Was it that bad?
[169:22.96]I don't think it was.
[169:23.80]I think you're mistaken here.
[169:26.96]They were all bad.
[169:27.78]The frog one definitely won.
[169:28.88]If it didn't, then there's something wrong with this community.
[169:31.30]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner of worst impression of the entire year is...
[169:37.25]What the fuck?
[169:39.22]It's not even in the top three.
[169:42.08]Toad was 23.2% of the vote.
[169:47.04]And then Jack Sparrow at 18.9.
[169:49.80]And then Patrick Star at 10.9%.
[169:54.39]One, two, and three.
[169:56.07]What?
[169:58.93]That frog was so bad.
[170:00.45]How is that not at like 80% of the vote?
[170:04.93]Alright.
[170:08.08]Time for the meaty categories.
[170:10.42]These are the ones that are full of flavor.
[170:13.76]I'm gonna take my time with these because this is my ego stroke here.
[170:18.70]It's time for an ego stroke.
[170:20.84]Until this one.
[170:22.14]But, you know.
[170:24.44]This next category is one that hits very deep to me and probably to those of you watching.
[170:30.48]This is for the best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[170:35.40]And what that means is that anything that took at least a few minutes to get rolling, okay?
[170:42.68]At least a few minutes to get rolling.
[170:44.90]So there were a lot of nominees, a lot of good ones, that I think that you're swearing.
[170:49.82]Santa is already across the globe right now.
[170:52.46]He's a very busy person, so he'll be a very busy man.
[170:55.94]Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for the best joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up.
[171:06.32]Toad wasn't even bad.
[171:07.20]Stop.
[171:07.48]I don't think that would add some atmosphere if like after every major kind of area and every puzzle was like music played and you just heard SCORN.
[171:19.90]That'd be kind of cool, I think.
[171:22.38]Oh, Jesus.
[171:24.26]Oh, what the fuck?
[171:26.30]SCORN.
[171:27.58]Blood.
[171:29.56]Lots of fucking blood.
[171:31.14]Lots of blood.
[171:32.30]That's a lot of blood.
[171:34.02]SCORN.
[171:35.93]I have to be better at fucking acting.
[171:38.66]True.
[171:42.46]Score.
[171:45.20]I'm sorry, I can't do it.
[171:53.19]Score.
[171:55.59]I don't know, I look like a different person.
[171:58.01]Leave it on so the Twitch thumbnail gets it.
[172:01.31]Alright, fine.
[172:02.35]Make this the thumbnail.
[172:04.07]No, dude, I...
[172:09.64]This is fucking insane.
[172:11.52]I think we're going a little too far.
[172:13.52]I think we're going too far.
[172:14.84]Okay, are you ready for the culmination of what is the thumbnail right now?
[172:19.40]Here you go.
[172:21.64]Welcome to hell.
[172:27.32]Now listen, Buster.
[172:30.61]Once we get down here, I'm going to make sure that we take care of this as soon as possible.
[172:38.31]Now, I don't get that move at all.
[172:40.47]That move is absolutely unbelievable.
[172:43.57]It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.
[172:45.51]And I'm telling you, yeah.
[172:48.13]You know what else is as ridiculous as that?
[172:50.11]Yeah, like, we're gonna get planes soon.
[172:51.81]Like, I can fly eventually, too.
[172:54.93]How many fucking moves do you get before you... I'm sorry about that, folks, but what I meant to say was, how many moves do you get to do in a row before, gosh darn it, you...
[173:03.91]Alright, here we go.
[173:04.91]I made the medic.
[173:05.85]I'm good to go.
[173:38.38]I'm not eating bugs.
[173:39.48]I wouldn't eat bugs if my if like my mother asked me to.
[173:43.70]What about a doctor?
[173:44.64]I don't know.
[173:45.16]What does the doctor look like?
[173:48.49]Is he, like, six feet tall?
[173:51.89]Like, 200?
[173:52.95]Lean cut?
[173:53.97]What does he look like?
[173:55.22]And he's so fit, he just got done cycling.
[173:58.26]And he's got cycling shorts on.
[174:00.32]And a lab coat.
[174:01.36]Stop sharing your fantasy.
[174:03.66]Just got done with a quick bike ride.
[174:09.65]Kickstand.
[174:10.93]Comes in.
[174:12.11]Just, like, sweat just glistening off his forehead.

[175:04.01]Hey, you, wait, look.
[175:08.71]Hey.
[175:11.13]Everybody, hey.
[175:12.01]I was on screen at a bar for those of you back there that don't know what's going on.
[175:16.54]I was typing and shit.
[175:20.84]Yeah!
[175:22.34]What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?
[175:26.80]Wait, can I do that?
[175:28.08]You were here for the longest stream I've ever done on this channel.
[175:33.76]13 hours, 19 minutes, and 41 seconds.
[175:38.68]Ain't ever gonna happen again.
[175:39.88]Should I do another moment?
[175:41.02]It's not, ever.
[175:47.83]I just left.
[175:49.04]You fucked up.
[175:50.84]13 hours, 27 minutes, and 6 seconds.

[175:59.10]Hey, man.
[176:01.11]I can't believe you made it.
[176:02.03]Was I on drugs?

[176:03.81]13 hours, 36 minutes, and 52 seconds.
[176:07.27]God, man.
[176:08.03]I can't believe.
[176:08.57]You were here.
[176:08.93]Don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[176:19.18]Hey, dude, can you speak up?
[176:20.10]I'm in a construction site.
[176:22.74]I would vote for this one.
[176:24.10]I love this one.
[176:27.77]I don't know.
[176:29.35]Okay, hold on.
[176:35.29]Like, why would you even go live?
[176:37.45]Just wait till tomorrow.
[176:38.43]Like, who cares?
[176:39.65]Fucking keep your stream off.
[176:43.42]There's nothing I can do about it.
[177:03.07]Okay.

[177:09.01]What am I supposed to do?
[177:10.92]Guys, what does that mean?

[177:16.70]Hold on, watch out, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!
[177:21.96]I gotta get this kill.
[177:23.39]Gotta get this kill, gotta get this kill.
[177:24.99]Oh, I died.
[177:29.77]Shoot!
[177:30.65]What if I just let Bernadette fall asleep on stream?
[177:34.61]Alright, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on screen.
[177:37.59]I think this is like dude wicked fucking tired I had a long day.
[177:41.89]I hope it wins both And then you're woken up by the jump scare It might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone is in proper place, you know?
[177:53.89]Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often
[178:06.36]Yeah.
[178:07.72]Yeah.
[178:08.54]So, speaking of which, I am a good man.
[178:11.98]I'm here to do something that I said that I would never do, and that's to play Destiny 2.
[178:17.67]I love this part when he says the doctor.
[178:19.11]I know.
[178:19.41]I said I'd never do it, but here we are.
[178:21.71]Shpee.
[178:24.31]That's the shpee ship.
[178:26.56]We're taking the shpee ship to war.
[178:31.49]You took everything from me, even though it's really actually not that bad.
[178:35.32]And I'm gonna watch it the rest of my life.
[178:38.18]You better run.
[178:39.20]And you better never look back.
[178:40.92]Is this a Scooby-Doo van?
[178:42.46]Is this the Mystery Machine?
[178:46.38]It's too dark!
[179:23.15]Well, that was quite a year.
[179:27.73]Those are your top jokes voted by you, nominated by you.
[179:34.14]Let's find out, I'm sorry, I just punched you.
[179:36.91]Can I get some of this off my face too?
[179:38.77]This is gonna be permanent.
[179:41.01]I just did it again, what the hell am I doing?
[179:45.19]Ladies and gentlemen, the best joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up is... Oh, it's an upset.
[179:57.71]It's an upset.
[179:59.55]This is an upset.
[180:03.09]with 25% of the vote, 25%.
[180:10.01]The ultimate thumbnail.
[180:12.13]The huge thumbnail wins.
[180:14.31]And then SCORN, far away at 12.6% of the vote, far away.
[180:20.93]And then sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's with 10% of the vote.
[180:27.21]That's kind of an upset.
[180:28.23]I thought that SCORN, all the scorners in the chat here,
[180:31.60]Probably gonna be pretty upset about that.
[180:35.43]Well, we did the good one.
[180:38.65]So why don't we do the bad one?
[180:41.91]If you think that I nail it every time, you're wrong.
[180:46.85]I have a tendency to, there's a couple of duds every year.
[180:49.75]Eh, a couple of duds.
[180:51.37]Not every joke is funny.
[180:53.71]I don't expect them to be.
[180:55.21]But how do you know if something's gonna be funny if you don't do it?
[180:58.76]Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for the worst joke of the year, taking five minutes to set up.
[181:14.09]What if I just pretended to fall asleep on stream?
[181:16.35]That's right, there it is.
[181:18.05]Alright, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.
[181:21.01]I'm gonna put a text on the bottom that says like, dude, wicked fucking tired.
[181:24.35]I had a long day.
[181:28.45]And then you get woken up by the jumpscare?
[181:30.15]Fuck!
[181:30.57]Yeah.
[181:30.73]Yeah.
[181:30.87]I don't know how I got into the Discord call, but I- somebody help, I got the wrong, uh, server ID, I think.
[181:57.52]I don't know how I got in this Discord call, but somebody help.
[182:00.17]I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[182:03.73]Did you click spectate?
[182:04.45]It's on the bottom left.
[182:05.19]No, I clicked the goddamn arrow.
[182:06.91]Where is, um... I don't know how I got in this Discord call, but I need somebody to help.
[182:10.87]I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[182:12.85]The fuck is that?
[182:13.89]I'm gonna have to go, I think.
[182:15.71]Guys, I think I got in the wrong Discord call.
[182:17.78]I don't know how I got in here.
[182:18.70]I got the wrong server ID.
[182:19.70]I don't know what's happening.
[182:20.44]If somebody can troubleshoot with me, I think I have to go up here.
[182:23.34]Who is that guy?
[182:24.62]What a weird guy.
[182:25.26]That guy's weird.
[182:26.94]A lunatic.
[182:27.60]Was that somebody in the call?
[182:28.34]What was that?
[182:29.24]Oh, shit.
[182:30.04]I don't know.
[182:30.72]It's still on.
[182:31.83]It's been on for hours now.
[182:35.33]I forgot your old voice.
[182:36.79]Can we ban Iron Giant?
[182:38.97]No.
[182:40.51]Alright.
[182:43.95]Well.
[182:46.29]Alright, we just need to figure out a solution to our problem.
[182:48.17]I don't fucking care if we lost.
[182:49.39]I'm doing the joke.
[182:51.74]What's up, Doc?
[182:54.02]That was pretty good.
[182:54.88]That was phenomenal, Jerma.
[182:56.32]That was a pretty good one.
[182:57.56]Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.
[183:00.08]He's dead.
[183:00.72]Okay, we're good, good, good, good, good.
[183:01.88]Yes.
[183:03.07]We got one.
[183:04.75]Watch out, Matt.
[183:06.07]Watch out, Matt.
[183:06.85]I just bit my tongue in half.
[183:08.71]We're in costume.
[183:09.79]I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.
[183:13.19]And who's that?
[183:14.35]Hey, how are you?
[183:15.21]It's me, Deadpool.
[183:16.05]It's nice to see everybody.
[183:17.21]Oh, my God.
[183:17.81]It's so good to have you here.
[183:18.87]Yeah, special guest here.
[183:20.35]So where do we start?
[183:21.52]I don't know, man.
[183:22.02]I just showed up.
[183:22.74]I just got the call.
[183:23.66]Yeah.
[183:24.46]They were like, hey, man, you want to be on Charlie's show?
[183:27.02]And I'm like, I love that guy.
[183:28.06]Of course I'm going to be on that show.
[183:30.80]I knocked out that motherfucker in the parking lot, by the way.
[183:33.06]He looked at me weird.
[183:33.66]No, that sounds exactly what he deserved.
[183:35.52]I went like that to him.
[183:37.58]Show him your high kick.
[183:38.68]Yeah?
[183:39.53]I went like this.
[183:45.82]Hey, kids!
[183:47.82]Soda!
[183:52.84]This sucked so bad.
[183:54.22]Nobody move.
[183:55.02]It's starting to lag.
[183:55.96]It's starting to lag out.
[183:57.91]I'm starting to get sick, I think.
[184:00.45]I'm gonna get sick.
[184:02.09]I'm at like 20 frames a second.
[184:05.83]Oh god, it's getting sick!
[184:07.91]Here we go!
[184:12.01]Somebody said embarrassing.
[184:13.21]Oh, shit.
[184:14.13]Oh, shit.
[184:14.39]This is bad.
[184:15.43]Actually, be careful.
[184:16.18]This might actually be flashing lights and stuff.
[184:17.76]I'm not kidding.
[184:18.08]Half these awards are embarrassing.
[184:26.64]Okay, here you go.
[184:27.32]You ready?
[184:29.96]It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad.
[184:33.61]Violet.
[184:41.34]Fuck!
[184:45.16]This is fucking stupid.
[184:48.07]That was so bad.
[184:50.19]This is fucking dumb, man.
[184:52.19]This is dumb.
[184:53.63]If Jerma reads this, he has to do a push-up on stream.
[185:23.76]Oh fuck, oh fuck.
[185:33.07]I would've voted for Five Nights at Freddy's.
[185:38.32]That's what I would have voted for.
[185:42.18]But some of those I don't think deserve to be there.
[185:44.65]I really don't.
[185:46.51]Breaking Bad was just, I don't know, I was just reaching at that point.
[185:49.97]Because we were on the high of Scooby-Doo.
[185:52.47]What's new Scooby-Doo?
[185:53.93]Coming after you.
[185:55.33]Gonna find that.
[185:56.76]And it's like, wow, this is so much fun.
[185:58.32]I'm having so much fun.
[185:59.12]Oh, what are the TV shows?
[186:00.40]What are the television shows can we do, right?
[186:03.84]I was reaching on the high.
[186:07.08]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner for worst joke of the entire year.
[186:12.13]The worst joke of the year is with 32% of the vote, someone got in the Discord.
[186:25.98]Someone got in the Discord and it wasn't me.
[186:27.86]Oh, someone's in the Discord.
[186:30.22]Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's was 22%, but hold on a minute.
[186:35.34]So number two is sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.
[186:38.34]Number three on best of the year was sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.
[186:44.90]So it was top three on here and top three on here.
[186:48.39]You guys need to make up your mind.
[186:51.21]And then doing pushups was 16.8%.
[186:52.75]I would have voted for that one, probably.
[187:00.38]The Breaking Bad one was pretty awful, but you know.
[187:05.19]I'm not looking forward to these next couple categories.
[187:13.07]These videos are probably 10 minutes long.
[187:15.49]Something about the worst and best noise categories this year.
[187:19.95]I mean, the mods went through it.
[187:22.75]Me and Holly went through it.
[187:25.04]We had to narrow this down.
[187:27.50]Best and worst noise of the year.
[187:30.87]There were 60 nominees until we really had to get rid of some.
[187:36.05]I think we brought it down to like 25 in each category.
[187:39.31]So strap in, turn your volume down.
[187:42.83]Because here are your nominees for best noise of the year.
[187:51.93]Or turn your volume up if that's what you care about.
[187:56.31]Oh, Jesus.
[187:58.21]Oh, what the fuck?
[188:05.61]What the fuck?
[188:07.17]How long do you think I can hold a Wilma for?
[188:11.70]Wilma!
[188:27.39]That was fucking long, dude.
[188:30.03]I tried to walk over to my water in VR.
[188:31.97]Hold on.
[188:32.31]No, that's not how that works.
[188:33.39]Oh, I got a drink too.

[189:06.81]I couldn't stand it.
[189:08.05]You know what sound that makes too.
[189:10.31]It's like You just like that cuz it sounds like the teacher noise I can put it over my head moving an amount of water from one room to another and go like this Is it should I do this?
[189:31.89]Okay, I'll do it
[189:37.59]No, no, I just heard that in my head.
[189:39.71]That hurt.
[189:40.09]I heard somebody laugh off camera.
[189:50.41]This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair.
[189:53.78]Okay.
[189:54.52]This is not, doesn't sound right at all.
[189:57.00]And let's do a scream test.
[189:59.04]Fixed it.
[190:01.06]How can we look plastic today?
[190:09.84]I mean, I don't feel plastic.
[190:14.76]Dung, dung, dung, dung.
[190:19.56]Oh, dude, 2-1 up.
[190:21.00]That was pretty good.
[190:22.50]Let's see this power.
[190:42.48]Oh, no.
[190:43.04]It's one of those... Are you wearing red because you're the imposter?
[190:50.29]Yes.
[191:00.61]When I'm lying in my deathbed and I'm connected to like about you know what it's I'm like 90 or something like a hundred.
[191:06.59]And everyone's like gathered around the bed and everyone's like oh let's just say goodbye to grandpa right.
[191:11.21]You bet your ass that I'm gonna be like... You bet your fucking ass that's the last thing I'm leaving you with.
[191:25.91]They're sucking me up!
[191:58.17]How many people are here right now on the channel?
[192:02.69]Do we have a number?
[192:03.19]65.
[192:06.66]There's 65,000 people here.
[192:12.08]And you just got subjected to that.
[192:14.70]So should I apologize?
[192:18.57]Or should we wait?
[192:20.55]Should we wait for this one?
[192:24.13]I'm going to hold my apologies till this one.
[192:28.24]Ladies and gentlemen, the, oh, I may have ripped it.
[192:31.89]The winner for best noise of the entire year.
[192:37.55]Was it ever going to be close?
[192:39.85]Let's spam it in the chat.
[192:42.45]You know what it is.
[192:43.57]Spam it.
[192:45.35]I'll do it if you spam it.
[192:47.30]I'll do it if you spam it.
[192:48.34]Mm-hmm.
[192:56.68]Scored.
[192:59.43]With 39% of the vote, SCORN absolutely killed it.
[193:07.06]Gimme, gimme, gimme was only 15.
[193:10.08]SCORN absolutely dominated this category.
[193:13.30]And then Are You the Imposter was three.
[193:17.24]So SCORN, a SCORN sweep right there, 40% of the vote almost.
[193:20.30]39.7% actually.
[193:25.22]That's a lot.
[193:26.82]So to the almost 60,000, 70,000 people that are here right now, I apologize for this next category.
[193:33.06]I apologize in advance.
[193:34.77]I said a lot of sorries already, but it's time for another one.
[193:38.85]I'm sorry about this category.
[193:42.33]Most nominees, I think, total.
[193:45.07]That had to get dwindled down, but...
[193:48.63]We have a best noise, we have a worst noise.
[193:51.29]They could just be the same category.
[193:54.54]I should just do a thing where it's just noise of the year because why even have two categories?
[194:01.68]Here are your nominees for worst noise of the year.
[194:27.15]It's just, you know what I mean?
[194:28.25]It's just the... It doesn't even lather up either.
[194:34.79]I'm so... That was bad.
[194:44.28]You've seen me do it like a hundred times.
[194:50.40]You can't dodge them all.
[195:00.06]He's turning.
[195:01.75]Oh, shit.
[195:02.31]He's turning.
[195:03.51]He just growled at him.
[195:05.35]Wrong game.
[195:06.31]Wrong game FromSoftware.
[195:07.65]Wrong game.
[195:22.03]NYEAH!
[195:44.89]Like some people eat a lobster like it's literally the last thing they're ever going to eat in their entire life.
[195:49.65]And they like... What's in here?
[195:55.13]And it's just like... God damn it.
[195:57.68]What are you doing?
[195:59.80]Oh, there's some still in there.
[196:05.20]And I just... I don't like it.
[196:06.96]I don't like it.
[196:07.54]I don't like it at all.
[196:08.79]It's revolting.
[196:09.57]It's absolutely fucking revolting.
[196:10.63]How about you fucking relax?
[196:14.72]Young Madoc, apprentice to Hunwit, the dream chanter, removes his instrument from its case.
[196:20.11]Its features, composed, take on a startling dignity.
[196:22.99]Let's hear it.
[196:43.81]This is on here twice?
[196:47.37]How many times was this nominated?
[196:55.66]Can I just say this is the worst moment of the whole year?
[196:58.28]I can say that, right?
[196:58.94]It's my channel.
[197:01.90]That's it?
[197:02.28]It goes like...
[197:11.91]I just threw one of those Nerf... You know those Nerf whistlers?
[197:17.03]The thing that, like, Brett Favre was in the commercial and he threw it, like, ah, look, there's, I can throw this 100 yards.
[197:21.65]And it goes... I just threw one of those.
[197:26.99]Okay, back to business.
[197:28.67]Well, now I know what this is for.
[197:33.60]We're all the way over here.
[197:35.15]Hold on.
[197:37.13]Here comes a backpedal.
[197:39.15]Did you guys hear that?
[197:40.49]What the fuck was that?
[198:07.19]Uh, there is recency bias, I think, on this one.
[198:10.88]We have some recency bias, I think.
[198:14.04]I don't think, I can literally see it through the paper, by the way.
[198:19.90]I peeked.
[198:23.46]Ladies and gentlemen, the worst noise of the entire year, recency bias, come on.
[198:29.95]The multiverse's squeal at 20% of the vote, not that bad.
[198:36.88]Growls at chat with 18.8.
[198:38.14]And I don't even, I don't know what this one is.
[198:44.34]Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.
[198:47.85]Do we even know, what is that one?
[198:50.41]Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.
[198:52.55]I was trying to watch, but I couldn't even, I don't know what that one is.
[198:57.55]Very good to know.
[198:58.25]A third most skipped category.
[199:04.23]13% of you that took the test did not take this one.
[199:08.26]You're like, fuck it.
[199:08.88]I don't want to hear that.
[199:09.76]I don't care.
[199:11.40]Which makes sense considering there's so many categories.
[199:14.32]And okay, but MultiVersus squeal.
[199:17.44]Hey, MultiVersus is a great game.
[199:19.05]You should try it.
[199:20.45]You know what?
[199:21.31]Can we check in with the puzzle room?
[199:23.75]Let's take a look at the puzzle room.
[199:24.77]How's the puzzler's doing?
[199:32.61]No one's doing anything.
[199:36.86]Have they not done any of the puzzle?
[199:41.44]Zero?
[199:42.14]Hold on.
[199:44.10]There's only one person doing it.
[199:46.06]I'm going in there.
[199:48.94]There's only one?
[199:49.70]They're all just like eating sandwiches.
[199:51.42]I need to see the progress.
[199:53.86]Oh, God.
[200:05.84]I'm not going to be angry.
[200:06.64]Hi, everybody.
[200:19.98]It seems as if there is, it looks like you've blocked out some areas.
[200:28.27]Can you get this?
[200:29.17]Where's the camera?
[200:32.25]Can you see this over here?
[200:35.35]They have one edge of one of the corners.
[200:41.51]What have you been doing in here?
[200:43.72]What's going on?
[200:44.30]What are you doing here?
[200:44.98]What is this?
[200:46.10]You playing cards?
[200:47.42]Yeah.
[200:53.28]Excuse me.
[200:56.84]What?
[201:01.20]Santa said to be nicer.
[201:04.98]So if you could please finish one section.
[201:17.45]This was a lot of money.
[201:19.57]This cost a lot of money.
[201:20.89]You heard Ludwig, and you heard H-Wrecker.
[201:22.55]By the way, where the fuck are they?
[201:24.94]Sorry for swearing.
[201:26.44]You know what?
[201:29.46]They're drinking.
[201:30.82]And they're drinking too.

[201:39.96]Who wants to go?
[201:40.44]You and me?
[201:42.12]Blackjack.
[201:43.20]I'll be the dealer.
[201:45.03]Where are the cards?
[201:46.29]Let's go Blackjack.
[201:47.59]What are these comically huge cards?
[201:52.29]Hey, by the way, is this the Ace of Clubs?
[201:55.23]Nope.
[201:55.55]That would have been fucking insane if it was.
[201:58.31]You want to go Blackjack?
[201:59.17]Ready?
[201:59.41]You know how to play Blackjack?
[202:01.62]You got this.

[202:16.36]Yes.
[202:16.56]We don't pay us enough to go watch it ourselves.
[202:19.92]What does this one say?
[202:22.66]Send hot cups of sa- that's a funny joke.
[202:25.16]What does this one say?

[203:52.52]Don't give it to him.
[203:54.32]Santa, if you're watching, I'm just being funny.
[203:57.10]Give me that toy.
[203:57.66]I made sure to not.
[204:01.88]5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.

[204:44.06]Can't do math?
[204:45.90]What happened?
[204:48.18]I can't do math, what happened?
[204:51.00]Did I get it, wait, count those cards, hold on a second.
[204:56.78]This is 17, that's 10, 18, what are you talking about?
[205:02.10]She won.
[205:03.48]We can't count.
[205:04.30]That's literally 18 versus 7.
[205:05.52]What are you talking about?
[205:06.48]I'm a man of my word.
[205:09.23]So guess what?
[205:10.97]All the elves in this area, you're going to split $60.
[205:23.09]Elves!
[205:24.25]Elves!
[205:25.15]Elves!
[205:26.01]Elves!
[205:27.03]Elves!
[205:28.22]Elves!
[205:29.10]Elves!
[205:30.00]Elves!
[205:52.44]I don't know how much they were getting paid anyways.
[205:58.26]Whatever.
[205:58.64]I mean, they were paid to do a puzzle, and they didn't do it.
[206:02.69]Let me make sure, let me be very clear.
[206:05.17]They were paid, all those people were paid to be here.
[206:10.15]They were all paid to be here, to do a puzzle.
[206:15.10]How much income is that worth?
[206:17.46]I'll double their pay.
[206:18.54]Fine.
[206:19.40]Yeah.
[206:22.56]How about this, hey elves, can you hear me?
[206:24.02]Elves, you can hear me, right?
[206:28.94]How about this?
[206:30.70]You get one section done.
[206:33.69]And I mean even a border.
[206:37.47]And I'll quadruple your pay.
[206:40.55]I wonder if they'll do it.
[206:44.85]I will five times your pay.
[206:47.86]Get a border done.
[206:52.23]A hundred each?
[206:54.13]Look, now they're all standing.
[206:56.23]Now they're all ready to go.
[206:57.51]They're like, holy shit, let's go.
[207:04.57]They were all sitting before.
[207:06.03]Now, hey, can we give it up for the elves?
[207:10.73]In the chat, give it up for the elves.
[207:13.73]Hey, hey, hey, you know what?
[207:15.75]Hey, hey.
[207:18.03]Let's five times their pay for fucking no reason.
[207:20.38]How does that sound?
[207:22.21]I'll do it, easy.
[207:27.25]Do the puzzle.
[207:28.69]That's what you're here for.
[207:30.15]And I may have almost hit somebody in the face with that turkey that I threw.
[207:35.59]Alright, we're at the next category.
[207:38.04]This is best one guy moment.
[207:42.36]One guy, there's a lot of people here.
[207:45.22]I imagine some of you don't know what the hell this means.
[207:47.68]A one guy.
[207:49.71]is when somebody kind of derails the stream.
[207:54.89]I will see it, I will comment on it, and it changes the outcome of the rest of the day.

[210:57.23]Somebody, somebody actually made this.
[210:59.73]These are really romantic candles.
[211:04.35]Oh, it probably stinks up here.
[211:09.76]I, uh, boss, I filled the room with red candles like you wanted.
[211:15.54]Gary, you fucking idiot.
[211:19.60]Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from Yankee Candle and put it in every room?
[211:24.79]Somebody said just eat a handful.
[211:29.37]That'd be so fucked up.
[211:32.13]You'd probably have like a fucking mental breakdown.
[211:37.50]It's not designed for that.
[211:38.90]Eat a handful?
[211:39.76]That'd be fucking disgusting.
[211:44.96]I'm kind of curious.
[211:45.90]I'm curious, let's go.
[211:59.23]It tastes like hamburger meat.
[212:00.97]It tastes like hamburger meat.
[212:03.53]Do a Mario drug PSA?
[212:12.84]Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[212:20.52]I'm Super Mario.
[212:22.90]We've made a lot of jokes here today.
[212:24.00]We've had a lot of fun.
[212:25.54]And I'm an actor.
[212:27.81]But let me just be the first to tell you that, you know, it's not fun.
[212:30.43]What is not totally byahoo?
[212:34.17]Drugs and alcohol.
[212:36.02]This is by somebody in the community.
[212:37.22]Are they comfortable with you sharing their name?
[212:38.90]I don't want to share their name if they're not comfortable.
[212:42.32]But anyways, they discovered a new way of isolating viruses that kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[212:50.44]Somebody in this community.
[212:53.79]And the first one I discovered using this method, I named after Jerma.
[212:58.26]This is apparently it fucking working.
[213:01.44]Against bacteria, antibiotic bacteria resistant shit.
[213:06.14]That's me in there.
[213:07.85]That's me taking care of that.
[213:10.81]I'm in there and I'm getting all of those fucking molecules and I'm destroying them.
[213:14.41]Make a sandwich with wood.
[213:24.83]I can't.
[213:29.91]I can't.
[213:31.31]Submit this.
[213:38.40]Play FNAF.
[213:39.56]Okay.
[213:43.70]I fucking quit the goddamn game.
[213:44.94]I exited the fucking game.
[213:49.98]What the fuck is happening?
[213:53.85]Jerma reads this, he has to do a push-up on stream.
[214:23.93]Oh, fuck!
[214:24.99]Oh, fuck.
[214:26.21]The ring light around your neck.
[214:30.35]If I put the ring light around my neck, I... It could actually fit.
[214:36.56]That would be fucking stupid.
[214:38.40]Wait a minute.
[214:50.97]Nice swag.
[214:51.83]Thanks.
[214:53.34]I was told that if I spin 100 times at $10, starting with $1,000 on this slot machine, that I will be able to get to $10,000 plus.
[215:03.81]There's a person in chat here who is putting their stream chat life here.
[215:10.13]They're going to be banned from the channel if it doesn't work, or they're going to get VIP'd if it does.
[215:13.17]Three.
[215:16.38]Four.
[215:19.06]Five.
[215:19.82]Oh my god.
[215:23.11]I'm so sorry.
[215:25.26]Hello.
[215:27.42]Yeah, and guess what?
[215:28.58]You can hear me, huh?
[215:29.96]You can hear me pretty well.
[215:31.74]Not like it was before.
[215:35.68]What the fuck, dude?
[215:37.02]I'm not going to drink a... Hold on.
[215:38.71]Alright, hold on.
[215:41.81]Let me just tweet that.
[215:42.59]How long is this fucking... Yeah, so hopefully it sounds alright.
[215:46.37]These things are pretty cool.
[215:48.03]Let me try a scream test.
[215:49.55]Can I try it?
[215:49.87]Hold on.
[215:51.83]Can I scream?
[215:52.55]Can I scream in your ears?
[215:53.47]I'm gonna scream in your ears.
[215:55.57]They should fucking remove geometry from school.
[215:59.04]Teach people how to do their taxes.
[216:00.48]I got some soft locked?
[216:04.60]How?
[216:05.30]No, I'm not.
[216:06.26]Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.
[216:09.10]How do I do it?
[216:09.66]How do I do it?
[216:10.72]How do I do it?
[216:11.26]It's so funny.
[216:13.20]How do I fix my save?
[216:14.32]Try X560Y330.
[216:15.06]New tweet.
[216:15.50]No, wait.
[216:15.86]Z330.
[216:21.29]Oh, Dev.
[216:21.87]Looks like you're having a little bit of trouble with geometry, aren't you?
[216:27.18]Looks like the Dev is having a little bit of trouble with geometry.
[216:29.58]Dev, when was the last time you were in fucking high school?
[216:34.14]When was... I am going to get so validated right now.
[216:37.50]I suck at math.
[216:41.08]I suck at math.
[216:41.92]I am in my 30s.
[216:42.94]I haven't had to do this for years.
[216:44.84]Go look at the tweet right now.
[216:45.86]I'm going to fucking... I'm framing this.
[216:47.68]I'm literally going to frame that tweet from Dusk Dev.
[216:53.18]No!
[216:54.32]I don't want... Alright.
[216:55.95]Can I just delete all the weapons besides the shotgun and the... I don't want to like... Yes.
[217:02.49]Oh, sorry.

[217:05.83]That is definitely the way.
[217:09.44]Yes.
[217:10.46]Unequip all of your weapons.
[217:12.88]That is definitely the way.
[217:14.60]That's the voice actor for this fight making fun of me.
[217:18.56]Bro, that looked like battle chess.
[217:23.41]You can turn me back on.
[217:32.50]Battle chest.
[217:35.71]Oh, that's... Oh, my God.

[224:12.43]Where is he?
[224:14.43]Oh, it's a fucking thing, the drape.

[224:44.87]There's nothing here.
[224:51.13]Oh my god, there's a bat!

[225:11.49]Oh!
[225:13.49]I don't know why I went in the dumpster.
[225:16.77]It's okay.
[225:17.33]I thought you were getting killed.
[225:21.11]No, I thought I was dead, dude.
[225:22.23]I was like, what the fuck?
[225:23.03]Somebody sniped me.
[225:24.02]It was terrifying.
[225:29.28]Okay.
[225:52.09]Oh, hey, hey, boys and girls.
[225:53.09]That would be a fucked up start to Mickey Mouse's clubhouse.
[226:12.60]Wait a minute.
[226:12.90]Where have I gone from here?
[226:13.82]Okay.
[226:20.15]Turn it off.
[226:23.55]Turn that off.
[226:24.05]Close it up.
[226:28.61]What?
[226:37.66]I'm wearing the same sweater too.
[226:45.15]I'm wearing the same clothes on.
[226:50.42]Relax.
[226:50.84]Holy shit, dude.
[226:51.60]Are you kidding me?
[226:52.94]This is not even scary.
[226:55.00]Did I just fake that?
[226:56.03]No, I really didn't.
[226:56.79]I swear to God.
[226:57.29]But, like, that was way overre- I haven't played a scary game in a long time.
[227:07.95]What?
[227:12.22]Oh, my God.
[227:12.92]How am I alive?
[227:14.74]I have absolutely- I was like, what are you pointing at?
[227:20.05]It's a cliff!
[227:43.05]What happened?
[227:46.51]I just shut down my computer.
[227:48.05]I think I shut my computer.
[227:49.95]I think I shut my computer down.
[227:57.99]Wow.
[227:58.30]A lot of scares this year.
[228:00.38]A lot of scares.
[228:05.28]I want to know what you guys picked.
[228:07.64]No fanfare.
[228:08.80]Let's go.
[228:11.04]Yeah.
[228:15.00]It technically happened last year.
[228:19.22]Wearing the same clothes.
[228:21.61]The volume warning puppet combo scare with 20% of the vote.
[228:27.01]It's the one where it looked like I saw a mouse go through the bottom of the screen there.
[228:32.72]It looks like, yeah, I mean, come on.
[228:36.44]Charborg Corner Jumpscare with Among Us is at 13.7, number two, 13.7.
[228:42.98]And then Iron Lung at 7.3%, number three.
[228:47.92]I mean, the cutoff of the awards was right at that Puppet Combo stream last year.
[228:54.46]So, honestly, I think a couple of years came off my life after that.
[229:00.59]I felt awful after that stream.
[229:04.16]I think I remember talking about it later, being like, I feel bad.
[229:09.56]I feel awful.
[229:10.08]I have a headache.
[229:11.38]My chest hurts.
[229:12.34]It actually felt terrible after that.
[229:15.40]Anyways, we are getting to the final seven awards.
[229:19.55]This is getting juicy.
[229:21.57]I've said that four or five times, but it is.
[229:24.89]Time to get to the big ones.
[229:29.55]Now,
[229:31.03]Every year, I like to sing some songs.
[229:34.95]I sing, I get involved, I enunciate, and we are going to show you now some of those nominees for what that means when it's good.
[229:46.94]Not bad when it's good.
[229:49.84]Here are your nominees for the best singing of the year.
[230:00.08]Hopefully it's good because I haven't seen this.
[230:10.77]You got a friend in me.
[230:12.79]This is on the other one too.
[230:15.19]You got a friend in me.
[230:20.29]When the road looks rubberhead and you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed.
[230:29.92]You just remember what your old pal said, but you got a friend in me.
[230:36.74]Fucking failed everyone.
[231:00.41]Oh, you're playing Dark Souls?
[231:07.91]Hey, son, what game you playing?
[231:14.29]Oh, I wonder.
[231:16.24]The only thing I remember from Arcane was... Oh, the misery.
[231:22.06]Every single person is my enemy.
[231:24.02]That's the only thing I know.
[231:26.62]I don't know anything else.
[231:33.50]I find that mystery.
[231:35.72]This is Scooby-Doo.
[231:37.70]Coming after you.
[231:39.56]Scooby-Doo.
[231:41.42]This is the fucking new Zoomer shit.
[231:42.86]This is not what I want.
[231:47.63]Oh!
[231:47.75]Duh.
[231:48.01]I can still get high.
[231:49.62]And I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.
[232:16.53]Not this one, I hope not.
[232:17.97]Scared?
[232:23.35]That's what you want.
[232:45.00]I'm gonna march out here and just start singing fucking John Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[232:54.26]What are you doing now?
[232:54.92]You're supposed to be scared.
[232:57.16]John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[233:00.49]His name is my name too.
[233:03.77]Whenever we go out, we always shout, here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[233:09.19]Why is this?
[233:10.29]Is this in the other one too?
[233:11.45]Get in the bathtub quick.
[233:12.75]This is terrible.
[233:13.25]Sing, chat, a lullaby.
[233:17.31]Little baby, don't say a word.
[233:18.39]I'm gonna buy you a mockingbird.
[233:19.55]If that mockingbird don't sing, I'm gonna buy you an iron ring.
[233:21.79]If that diamond ring don't shine, I'm gonna buy you a glass of wine.
[233:28.89]When you get old enough, over 21.
[233:29.85]Can we get an apples and bananas remix?
[233:34.43]Are you talking about like the... I want to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
[233:40.75]That's what you mean?
[233:41.83]I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
[233:47.20]And feel like I belong.
[233:51.03]Oh, this one's good.
[233:51.97]This one's good.
[233:52.99]I can go the distance.
[233:57.53]I'll be there someday.
[233:59.71]If I can be strong, I know every mile will be worth my while.
[234:11.63]I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong.
[234:28.69]Well, I like that last one.
[234:31.35]That was pretty good.
[234:33.23]Phillip, we'll see what you think.
[234:35.39]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best singing of the year is...
[234:41.80]I don't know if production has it ready, but I'll just wait till you do.
[234:46.81]Can we just play it?
[234:47.51]Can we just play it?
[234:48.95]Can we just play it?
[234:53.13]You know what won.
[234:54.41]Can we just play it through?
[234:55.37]DMCA, I know.
[234:56.39]The channel will get shut down, but who gives a shit?
[235:00.58]They don't have it.
[235:02.00]Okay, it's with 31.1%.
[235:02.58]31% of the vote is... Oh, the misery.
[235:12.43]Okay, at number two with 25%, all the Hatsune Miku fans, popipo, and then Hercules, go the distance, which was actually the good one.
[235:22.19]That was the good one.
[235:23.63]At 9.85%, good job, by the way, good job.
[235:28.57]There you go.
[235:29.97]But now, I do want to do something very special.
[235:34.31]We saw them earlier.
[235:36.03]Didn't really get a chance to show off what they could actually do.
[235:40.53]Feel like it's a good place to do it, though.
[235:42.83]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back into the studio, Top Shelf Vocal!
[235:51.94]We'll get a couple of actual good songs here.
[235:55.02]And I'm going to get out of here because I shouldn't be here.

[239:45.05]Thank you.
[239:46.49]So with that...
[239:48.37]Now, don't listen.
[239:49.09]I don't want you guys to, don't listen to this.
[239:52.29]We're gonna go to the next category, which is maybe the worst singing of the year.
[239:57.66]Maybe.
[239:58.98]I sing, you've heard me, I've sung before a few times.
[240:02.42]A couple times, yeah.
[240:04.48]Here are your nominees for the worst singing of the year.
[240:08.76]Right after that great performance.
[240:15.03]You guys killed it, that was fucking amazing.
[240:21.18]what do you mean bjork I don't sound like bjork what do you mean all I think of all I can think of is like
[240:47.51]That's how you get punched in the face.
[241:07.83]We're all good friends and we all get together sometimes.
[241:12.28]When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck and out of change.
[241:16.76]We will work together and we will have... I'm sorry.
[241:19.82]That's what I expected.
[241:21.64]That's what I expected.
[241:22.64]I expected that.
[241:24.27]She's such a misfit.
[241:26.17]Always ready to fight.
[241:27.45]She's got a super beam.
[241:29.27]And she's raising high.
[241:31.17]If you believe you're strong.
[241:35.45]So you know the whole song?
[241:36.39]I don't.
[241:37.90]I heard like a minute of... Sing a good night song for Boba.
[241:49.92]Boba, the kitty.
[241:52.72]Have a good rest.
[241:56.60]See you in the morning.
[242:00.23]Boba, such a good kitty.
[242:05.65]See you in the morning.
[242:08.81]Good morning.
[242:09.49]Good morning.
[242:10.17]Good morning to you all.
[242:11.59]Good morning.
[242:12.31]Good morning.
[242:14.53]I'm going to take a fall.
[242:17.37]It's such a wonderful world we live in in this nice street.
[242:20.54]We're almost there.
[242:21.16]Here we are.
[242:24.08]Oh, the misery.
[242:25.46]Every single person is my enemy.
[242:31.79]Here it goes, here it goes.
[242:33.27]We go from Nashville to Norway, to Zimbabwe, to Chicago, to Czechoslovakia, and back.
[242:42.22]All the weather outside is bright.
[242:51.22]What's wrong with this?
[242:52.82]I got fire, solar light.
[242:56.83]Since we... Since we no place... Hold on.
[243:01.37]Since we no place... I'll get it.
[243:03.85]Shut up.
[243:05.37]Since we no place to go.
[243:08.33]Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[243:11.80]Use that part.
[243:13.14]What was wrong with that?
[243:13.74]That was fine.
[243:17.34]You've got a friend in me.
[243:20.98]Got a friend in me.
[243:23.56]Certain people...
[243:25.27]Having one of a life and I have... That's it, right?
[243:29.03]Alright, I'm going to count you guys in, okay?
[243:33.53]3, 2, 1, go.
[243:35.75]She sang over the hills.
[243:37.55]It instantly voice jammered me.
[243:43.27]Take your headphones out.
[243:44.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[243:45.75]Sir, sir.
[243:46.31]Take out your headphones.
[243:47.45]Okay.
[243:47.85]Ready?
[243:49.72]3, 2, 1.
[243:51.10]She sang over the hills.
[243:52.90]Peaks are shy, but sure don't.
[243:56.22]And sure, as the sun rise, I'll someday be gone.
[243:59.36]But recall me, my love, and our joy may live on.
[244:05.52]And you do, and you do, and you do.
[244:10.55]That's a howl at the end.
[244:11.31]That has to be a howl at the end.
[244:22.49]Some of those weren't that bad.
[244:26.54]I mean, cringe, is it like a most cringe category?
[244:30.12]Maybe, no.
[244:30.76]I have to top shell vocal, I know.
[244:41.31]These were close.
[244:44.55]It was pretty much every single nominee.
[244:46.34]15.5, 14.4, 13.9, 13, 12,
[244:54.71]It's all of them.
[244:55.57]You couldn't choose.
[244:57.63]But if you had to, with 15.5% of the vote, it's Bjork.
[245:02.26]Bjork wins.
[245:04.02]And then right underneath that 14.4% was Beatbox Oh The Misery.
[245:07.28]And then 13.9% was the Splatoon 3 Laughing Song.
[245:10.88]I mean, the Bjork.
[245:24.76]That stream, I would have nominated for worst stream of the year.
[245:28.80]Is it in there?
[245:30.58]It might be.
[245:32.69]Alright, let's count the categories.
[245:35.05]We've got one, two, three, four, five.
[245:38.79]We've got, what, five or six categories remaining?
[245:40.89]These are the huge ones.
[245:42.89]These are the major, massive categories.
[245:45.47]Are you ready?
[245:48.44]How you guys feel?
[245:51.12]You guys in the Christmas spirit?
[245:52.78]Holiday spirit?
[245:55.50]Yeah.
[245:57.10]Can you please do a Bjork?
[246:03.32]Yeah.
[246:08.71]Pretty good.
[246:10.79]Pretty good.
[246:12.95]I tried.
[246:15.85]Bjork is a very talented singer, by the way.
[246:18.63]More talented than I will ever be times 100.
[246:23.01]Just make that clear.
[246:23.65]I have nothing on Bjork.
[246:26.09]Zero.
[246:32.07]What's that say?
[246:34.49]That is best gamer moment of the year.
[246:38.27]Did I do good in a game?
[246:39.93]Did I play Call of Duty versus a hacker?
[246:43.71]Who may have been cheating, we don't know.
[246:47.76]See him for lunch or dinner on Friday.
[246:51.36]Extinguisher if you still hear me.
[246:55.25]I like extra lettuce on my hamburgers.
[246:57.79]I like crunch.
[247:00.20]Best gamer moment of the year incoming.
[247:02.12]These are the moments that I actually did very well.
[247:06.10]Not this one.
[247:07.38]Don't look at that one yet.
[247:08.44]It's not time for that one.
[247:09.76]We're gonna put that down and we're gonna show you the nominees for best gaming moment of the year.
[247:16.87]This is when I did well.
[247:19.99]Here are your nominees.
[247:23.92]Somebody's probably actually insane.
[247:25.66]Ban that person for an hour.
[247:30.17]And then, like, you bet, like, a little bit there, and then maybe I'd be like, you know, what's 50 more?
[247:36.79]You know what I mean?
[247:37.31]It's a nominal amount.
[247:39.07]It's a nominal amount.
[247:40.17]Somebody said Elmo.
[247:41.33]What does that mean?
[247:45.33]Jerma, you absolute idiot.
[247:49.40]Am I stupid?
[247:49.88]Because I just won the game.
[247:57.65]That's a three of a kind.
[247:58.79]You just got sharked!
[248:11.22]Were you here?
[248:12.28]Were you in the room?
[248:13.82]Were you in the fucking room?
[248:15.96]I got a bet for you.
[248:17.54]Can I complete my own mini golf course in less than 20 strokes?
[248:23.66]Six.
[248:27.24]And seven.
[248:28.58]Here comes seven.
[248:30.52]Motherfuckers, you didn't think I was gonna skip the whole goddamn course?
[248:38.64]Yes!
[248:39.12]You all lose.
[248:47.81]You all lose.
[248:49.83]Never bet against me again.
[248:52.77]What's happening?
[248:53.47]Am I winning?
[248:57.05]I don't know.
[248:58.41]Did I just- Did I win?
[249:13.00]Why won't he fight me?
[249:17.88]Hurry up.
[249:18.30]Run.
[249:20.99]God damn it.
[249:21.85]I knew it was a problem.
[249:25.65]I have to be off to this guy before he rings the alarm.
[249:28.56]Fuck, come on.
[249:38.52]Why is he so much faster than me?
[249:45.99]I got him.
[249:58.10]I beat him!
[250:06.22]Some pretty good moments.
[250:08.82]That game is so hard.
[250:10.62]They made it too hard.
[250:13.20]ULTRAKILL, devs, if you're watching.
[250:16.26]Your game's too hard.
[250:18.96]The hardest game at Walmart.
[250:21.31]It's not even at Walmart.
[250:24.13]No, that's an old callback.
[250:26.09]The game's hard, just to let you know.
[250:28.45]Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best gamer moment of the year is... This was huge.
[250:42.08]44.6%.
[250:43.08]Almost 45% of the vote.
[250:46.04]The ultimate poker bluff versus Ludwig wins.
[250:51.42]Hey, come on.
[250:53.28]Took all his money.
[250:54.94]He's here somewhere.
[250:55.62]He's back there somewhere.
[250:57.14]Sorry, Ludwig.
[250:59.08]Beat you in poker.
[251:00.36]It's my game.
[251:01.98]And then after the first try, Cuphead DLC boss at what, 14.8%?
[251:07.94]That's not even close.
[251:09.91]And then beating Ulcerated Tree Spirit early.
[251:14.99]What's so impressive?
[251:15.63]You beat the Tree Spirit, who cares?
[251:17.79]That was like 30 levels too early.
[251:20.01]I accidentally walked into that boss.
[251:22.39]So that's pretty impressive, I think.
[251:26.52]So there you go.
[251:28.20]Weirdly enough, the mini golf course was fourth or fifth place.
[251:33.72]People thought the Ludwig Bluff was way better.
[251:37.07]And just like the good, there's also the bad.
[251:39.31]I don't remember these nominees, but they were way more than best.
[251:48.19]I think they were, we had to narrow it down because I think they were like, oh wow, cool, Jeremy, you got like seven nominees for best gamer moment and 70 for worst gamer moment.
[251:58.30]So we really had to narrow this down.
[252:00.60]Honestly, I don't even know what's on this list.
[252:02.54]I haven't seen it.
[252:03.88]I just knew we did a few passes on it because we had to.
[252:07.86]So here are your nominees for just like best gamer moment.
[252:10.82]Here is the worst gamer moment of the entire year.
[252:14.00]Worst gamer moment.
[252:20.15]This is a nine minute category, by the way, so strap in.
[252:23.21]Hand fire tornado.
[252:24.95]Jesus.
[252:26.07]Give fire to the tornado.
[252:30.62]Bro, there ain't no tornado on the screen.
[252:33.56]Hand the fire to the tornado.
[252:36.56]But do it quietly.

[254:40.13]You're just floating.
[254:42.51]How long am I supposed to hold this for?
[254:44.41]A while.
[254:46.31]I'm going to run out of grip.
[254:48.46]I'm going to run out of grip.
[254:52.50]Hold on.
[254:52.80]Hold on.

[255:40.10]I just ran back to the entrance.
[255:51.42]Time.
[255:52.46]Oh, that's what ruined everything.
[255:53.54]6.56.
[255:54.70]19.
[255:56.14]That would have been it.
[255:58.05]Oh, no.
[255:59.97]Time.
[256:00.37]That was it.
[256:01.37]Yeah.

[256:19.88]Alright, I'm getting Luigi'd.
[256:22.20]I'm gonna need these later.
[256:23.20]I'm taking them with me.
[256:23.82]I'm taking all these with me.
[256:37.09]Don't.
[256:37.29]Don't.
[256:37.43]What the f...
[256:44.73]Can I have one?
[256:45.45]Can I please have one?
[256:47.11]Why did it let go?
[256:47.99]Nice.
[256:48.09]There's one other, at least one other player for sure.
[257:19.18]Guys, how do I land?
[257:22.36]What?
[257:22.60]Dude, you're kicking butt right now, dude.
[257:29.40]I can't even.
[257:40.79]Game's fucking easy.
[257:48.24]Do not flip the car under any circumstance.
[257:51.62]Don't do it.
[257:52.88]It's not funny.
[257:53.90]It's not a joke.
[257:55.98]It would be annoying because you just wasted like 35 straight minutes cutting wood.
[258:01.16]Jeremy, I know you think you're quite the comedian, but this is not the time to do that.
[258:07.90]Let's go.
[258:12.80]And a lot of people are going to think that that was on purpose, but it was not.
[258:16.63]Like a utility.
[258:25.49]We're good, we're good, we're good. We're good, we're good. We're good, we're good.
[258:34.49]Big points on the board right now. Big points.
[258:42.04]I got beam, I got beam.
[258:43.74]I need res, I need res.
[258:44.58]Oh, guys, we need to get to the fucking... We need to get in the car and get the fuck out.
[258:47.42]I need res, I need res.
[258:48.28]I don't last hit.
[258:48.96]He's not a gamer.
[258:49.70]I'm coming around.
[258:50.28]Can't shut up.
[258:51.28]Is there a way to get out of here?
[258:53.48]I guess we just run.
[258:55.24]Flashbang, going out!
[258:56.00]Flashbang, going out!
[258:57.10]Flashbang!
[259:10.80]Wow
[259:37.29]Jesus.
[259:38.33]Whoa.
[259:39.13]Really?
[259:40.13]Whoa, dude.
[259:40.55]That was bad.
[259:41.59]I have to leave now.
[259:43.11]That was awful.
[259:44.11]I can't... I didn't get anything.
[259:51.84]We're in trouble.
[259:52.68]How do I solve this?
[259:53.26]Someone said, half of these are from Breath of the Wild.
[259:55.30]Is there another thing I can eat that takes me to the last bonfire?
[259:57.69]How do I fix this?
[259:59.05]Into the forest?
[260:01.21]I'm so sorry.
[260:03.05]Oh, shit.
[260:06.07]Oh, this is bad.
[260:07.35]This is bad.
[260:08.27]This is bad.
[260:09.29]This is bad.
[260:09.91]This is bad.
[260:10.45]This is bad.
[260:11.31]This is bad.
[260:12.97]Um, I think we're in trouble.
[260:15.20]I think we're in trouble.
[260:24.18]See here?
[260:25.36]Keep your eyes on the lady.
[260:27.53]Where is she gonna go?
[260:28.47]Where is she gonna go?
[260:29.45]I got it.
[260:37.66]That was easy.
[260:41.10]Oh, Boto, don't be feeling too bad.
[260:42.46]Ain't nobody can... What?
[260:43.88]Wait, what happened?
[260:44.90]Was I not even looking?
[260:51.67]Hey, let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed.
[260:53.45]Don't make a joke!
[260:54.29]Stop!
[261:00.82]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[261:03.02]Why did I do that?
[261:04.12]Why did I do that?
[261:04.64]I was going to make a joke where I was going to close my eyes and cast a spell.
[261:07.00]This hurt so bad.
[261:07.82]It really did.
[261:08.18]What the fuck are you doing?
[261:09.10]This was so painful.
[261:10.02]What am I doing?
[261:11.74]Why would I do that?
[261:12.82]Internally, I was so internally mad at myself.
[261:14.65]I swear to God.
[261:17.66]Kill him.
[261:17.88]Kill him.
[261:18.40]Kill him.
[261:18.62]I can't do it.
[261:19.02]Kill him.
[261:19.32]I don't know how to do it.
[261:19.92]Kill him.
[261:20.40]I don't know how to do it.
[261:21.12]Kill him.
[261:21.78]How do you do it?
[261:23.18]Kill him.
[261:23.62]I don't know how to do it.
[261:25.48]What?
[261:25.98]What are you doing?
[261:26.90]There's a cool down.
[261:29.80]What?
[261:30.24]What?
[261:31.04]There's a cool down.
[261:32.64]That can't be good.
[261:33.56]A lot of good ones.
[261:44.70]But there can only be one winner.
[261:48.13]I'm trying to peek, let's see.
[261:51.75]I can't see through the envelope.
[261:56.21]Your winner for worst gamer moment of the whole year.
[262:04.81]Actually surprising.
[262:07.57]24.4% of the vote.
[262:11.33]Kill him, kill him, I don't know how to do it.
[262:15.13]From Among Us VR.
[262:19.06]And then at 11%, we're going way down.
[262:24.27]11.7%, Margit is one hit away.
[262:26.67]Let's do the rest of this with my eyes closed.
[262:30.53]And then trying to land in Fortnite at 9%.
[262:34.83]Apparently that first one was so bad.
[262:36.27]I don't play Among Us.
[262:38.97]I don't play it.
[262:39.81]How was I supposed to know that?
[262:41.27]That's not a worst gamer moment.
[262:43.57]That is a, I didn't do the tutorial moment.
[262:47.65]because I wanted to get in and hang out with my friends and play video games.
[262:50.25]What, is it a fucking crime?
[262:54.55]Oh boy.
[263:01.32]This is a big one.
[263:03.18]Coming up next, this is number 24 in the night.
[263:07.02]This is the worst overall stream of the whole year.
[263:11.12]Or worst stream segment.
[263:14.86]What do you think the worst stream this year was?
[263:19.17]I have few guesses.
[263:19.85]I don't know.
[263:24.73]Let me, before you show the nominees.
[263:28.70]Ooh, that's toasty.
[263:31.30]Every stream, I try to have it be fun.
[263:34.76]I try to have a good time, an idea that maybe, oh, well, this is a new idea.
[263:39.42]Maybe this is an old idea.
[263:41.58]Every stream I want to be fun, right?
[263:44.44]That's the whole goal.
[263:45.70]As a streamer, you want the streams to be good.
[263:49.02]but sometimes you miss the mark.
[263:51.46]And we're about to find out how badly that mark was missed.
[263:57.70]Ladies and gentlemen, for 2022, here are your nominees for worst stream or stream segment of the entire year.
[264:16.50]Nice.
[264:16.90]There's one other, at least one other player for sure.
[264:23.30]This is pretty bad.
[264:24.08]Alright, whatever.
[264:25.48]I don't play Fortnite.
[264:26.46]I don't play this game.
[264:28.76]I just want to hang out with some cool friends, streamer friends, right?
[264:31.67]Like, what the fuck?
[264:33.23]Is that so bad?
[264:35.77]Guys, how do I land?
[264:38.57]I have, what's it called?
[264:39.71]Splash.
[264:40.27]I can throw it at everyone.
[264:41.29]I've got six minis.
[264:43.18]Run!
[264:43.80]I'm sorry, I don't know how to skip this one.
[264:46.52]I don't know why I went in the dumpster.
[264:48.06]Okay, for all you worst stream ever Andes, alright?
[264:52.89]And so I'm not going to address it anymore.
[264:56.02]I'm not going to address it anymore.
[264:58.04]I'm just telling you.
[265:00.60]You need to respect me for a minute.
[265:03.96]This sucks.
[265:04.74]That's how you know.
[265:05.86]Excuse me.
[265:06.75]What do you mean?
[265:08.55]Excuse me.
[265:09.11]This was picked in pre-stream chat.
[265:10.95]This was a prank?
[265:11.93]No, this is not a prank.
[265:14.07]In the pre-stream, people were like, yo, dude, Glover Pog.
[265:18.39]how much I'm looking at the chat the hacker wanted me to play this by the way which I don't know about that this is this this is kind of this is PogChamp game dude you fell off you can't fall off in 20 minutes you can't fall off in 20 minutes okay you can't fall off I didn't fall off it's been 15 minutes you don't fall off in 15 minutes okay 20 percent 90 percent is buster already made
[265:49.93]What am I doing wrong?
[265:52.93]It's 20% and 80% or 10% and 90%, right?
[266:01.49]Settle down.
[266:01.81]It's fine.
[266:02.47]Dude, this is genuinely worse than the clock.
[266:05.55]What?
[266:08.07]How is this worse than the clock?
[266:09.27]I'm doing what it says I'm supposed to be doing.
[266:11.65]If you can get it to work, it's definitely a lot better.
[266:16.16]The person was standing still and I couldn't even kill him.
[266:19.71]I'm so bad at this game.
[266:23.25]That's me!
[266:24.71]That's me!
[266:26.45]That's you?
[266:27.69]Oh, I thought that was a bad guy.
[266:37.69]We're good.
[266:37.95]We're good.
[266:38.21]We're good.
[266:39.63]We're good.
[266:39.91]We're good.
[266:40.15]We're good.
[266:40.85]Bye-bye.
[266:41.90]See you guys later.
[266:48.31]Shoot!
[266:49.71]I was about to frag her!
[266:51.09]Tell him you're the sus guy.
[266:58.01]This one is so bad.
[266:59.80]This is streamer's choice.
[267:00.74]This wins for me.
[267:01.26]I'm about to veto this.
[267:04.24]All gone.
[267:05.00]I think I have to veto this whole thing.
[267:14.27]But in the meantime, if there's any more You Laugh, You Lose compilations, I'd love to watch them.
[267:19.95]Maybe we can get them vetted quickly or something.
[267:22.39]But I ain't watching.
[267:24.03]I'm done after this.
[267:24.67]This is fucking what a shit idea.
[267:26.13]This is one of the worst ideas I've ever had.
[267:28.16]Figure out the Disney lyrics.
[267:30.44]Ooh.
[267:31.72]Up on that beach.
[267:36.06]Up on that shore.
[267:39.51]Up on that many...
[267:44.79]people galore makes you kind of think I can go the distance this was good I'll be there someday if I can be strong I know every mile will be worth my while it's I've figured it out any of the bosses that have like the
[268:15.04]Ludwig has it.
[268:15.84]Godrick has it.
[268:16.64]Ibritas has it.
[268:17.40]They all have it.
[268:18.20]Bro, that looked like battle chess.
[268:31.39]This stream was so bad.
[268:32.59]Somebody just said... It was.
[268:34.97]It was fucking terrible.
[268:36.11]Oh, my God.
[268:36.75]You just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.
[268:38.49]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[268:41.84]No.
[268:43.36]No.
[268:47.16]Yes.
[268:49.02]Yes.
[268:50.92]Yes.
[268:57.56]Funny story about the Dark Souls FromSoftware tier list.
[269:02.52]And I'm going to be honest.
[269:04.32]I got halfway through that list and internally wanted to stop.
[269:09.53]But you can't.
[269:11.61]It was like another three hours.
[269:12.93]It was like a four and a half hour stream.
[269:16.14]I remember getting halfway through, scrolling down, and just going, there's like a hundred bosses I still haven't raided yet.
[269:25.06]Internally, I wanted to turn the stream off, but I didn't.
[269:28.11]I powered through.
[269:28.65]And it was a mistake.
[269:31.85]Could've just played, uh, could've just played, like, Picross, and people would've been happy.
[269:39.55]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the worst stream of the whole year,
[269:57.26]It was close.
[270:03.42]It was close.
[270:05.04]With 27.6% of the vote.
[270:07.72]Number one.
[270:08.91]And then 26.2, all these votes count, by the way.
[270:12.43]Oh, I'm not gonna vote because I don't think it counts.
[270:15.03]27.6 and one, 26.2 and two.
[270:17.37]Number one, the Fortnite tournament.
[270:26.55]I think I was alive for four minutes and the stream was like three hours long.
[270:32.49]And then baby sensory videos right behind it at 26.2.
[270:36.13]That was a bad, I thought that was so funny when we first talked about it.
[270:41.67]Oh, dude, what a fun idea.
[270:42.88]I'll do baby sensory videos.
[270:46.74]I don't know, they're scary.
[270:48.36]If you've seen one, they're terrifying.
[270:51.40]It wasn't even funny, it was just,
[270:54.22]It was just odd.
[270:55.04]It's just odd.
[270:58.54]You know, okay, those of you streamers out there, if you're watching, you know when you get that moment when you're doing something and you just go, fuck, this is bad, and I don't know what to do.
[271:11.49]I don't know how to get out of this.
[271:12.43]How do I get out of this?
[271:13.09]How do I get out of this?
[271:13.95]There has to be a way I can get out of this.
[271:16.64]and there isn't, and you have to sleep in the bed that you made.
[271:20.24]That was the baby sensory, because I hyped that up for a week or two.
[271:24.74]Oh, we're going to do baby sensory videos.
[271:26.97]It's going to be crazy.
[271:27.93]Wow, we're going to talk about them.
[271:29.55]And after one or two, I wanted to turn the stream off so bad.
[271:35.55]And I was like, I just want to go.
[271:36.46]I want to take a bath.
[271:37.18]I just want to get out of here.
[271:38.50]But you can't.
[271:41.36]Number three, by the way, was at 15%.
[271:45.12]Mythbusters, the game.
[271:46.90]Yeah, it wasn't very good.
[271:49.87]These are your worst dreams of the year.
[271:51.37]I don't play, I don't play video games.
[271:53.39]I'm not a video gamer.
[271:55.25]I am though, because Elden Ring, I beat Elden Ring, I beat Dark Souls 3, I beat Dark Souls Remastered.
[271:59.63]How can you not say that?
[272:01.07]I just, I don't play certain types of games.
[272:03.17]I don't play Fortnite.
[272:04.09]I don't play Call of Duty.
[272:06.59]Who cares, right?
[272:07.95]Whatever, you know what?
[272:09.71]Let's go check in with the elves.
[272:13.85]Follow me.
[272:17.23]Hold that door for me.
[272:28.10]Elves, I'm coming to say hello!
[272:29.68]There's some noise in here.
[272:35.28]I think we can start reselling after our two tickets.
[272:38.10]I think they're gonna take off.
[272:39.28]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[272:40.24]What about the elves?
[272:41.04]Hello?
[272:43.96]What are you doing?
[272:44.61]Investing.
[272:45.97]We're investing the money.
[272:47.26]Brainstorming.
[272:47.98]The money that you promised us.
[272:50.79]What do you got here?
[272:51.67]How do you feel about investing in N-Elf Tees?
[272:53.47]N-Elf Tees, they're gonna take off.
[272:54.91]N-Elf Tees.
[272:56.17]Not what you're thinking, but they're actually elf T-shirts.
[272:58.69]Yeah.
[272:59.17]What?
[273:00.35]That's cool, we have other ideas.
[273:03.13]Yeah, we got both.
[273:03.87]Gingerbread.
[273:04.96]Robots to build puzzles.
[273:06.54]Yes.
[273:06.92]You need that considering you haven't done a goddamn thing.
[273:09.72]But wait a minute.
[273:10.74]I feel a little disrespectful.
[273:13.76]Clearly there's some stuff happening.
[273:16.70]You've done a border of one of them.
[273:18.60]Oh, she has.
[273:20.64]Puzzle girl!
[273:21.86]Puzzle girl!
[273:23.22]Puzzle girl!
[273:24.36]Puzzle girl!
[273:25.68]Puzzle girl!
[273:26.92]Puzzle girl!
[273:28.15]Puzzle girl!
[273:29.55]You ought to just stop.
[273:30.49]I was doing it still.
[273:33.43]That's good.
[273:35.31]Oops.
[273:37.27]I got a better idea.
[273:37.91]How about this?
[273:41.95]Why do I hear Smash Brothers?
[273:44.73]Activities?
[273:45.25]We were also playing games.
[273:47.10]You're playing games?
[273:48.34]Alright.
[273:48.84]I tried to hide it.
[273:49.80]You play games.
[273:51.23]I'll give that a sick.
[273:53.03]Oh, thanks.
[273:55.09]Hey, what are these?
[274:01.85]Hey, these are $1,000 chips.
[274:03.03]These are $1,000 bucks.
[274:04.07]Nobody's getting these.
[274:09.13]Hey, elves.
[274:10.25]What?
[274:10.75]Yeah?
[274:11.17]Do you think it should be snowing in here?
[274:13.11]Yeah.
[274:15.21]Yeah.
[274:16.27]Yeah.
[274:16.53]I love snow.
[274:17.55]Hey, chat.
[274:18.61]Should it start snowing in here yet, do you think?
[274:22.44]I want to make sure I see it first.
[274:25.52]Should it start snowing for real this time?
[274:30.56]Do it for Puzzle Girl.
[274:31.49]Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow!
[274:40.49]Let's go!
[275:03.21]Shit, they were bored in here.
[275:04.84]This was all worth it!
[275:11.46]Okay.
[275:12.08]What is this?
[275:13.52]Whoa!
[275:16.19]A present?
[275:18.23]You know, all my presents got deleted, you know that, right?
[275:20.77]It's gonna be okay!
[275:21.95]It's gonna be okay!
[275:26.04]Who is this from?
[275:26.56]From all of us.
[275:28.16]From all the elves?
[275:28.90]The elves.
[275:30.08]Good luck doing the puzzle, by the way, because it's literally impossible.
[275:35.17]OK, from the elves.
[275:39.43]What is it?
[275:39.93]Maybe it's an egg.
[275:41.03]Could it be an Xbox?
[275:45.82]What is this?
[275:46.76]That's the bin we put the puzzle in.
[276:00.21]Hey, give it up for the elves, can we please?
[276:07.63]Why did I do that?
[276:15.32]It's like being at the lunch table.
[276:24.94]Hey, dude, eat the meatball covered in gravy and all the fuck that we're... I did that stuff when I was younger.
[276:31.76]Give it up for the elves.
[276:33.66]They did absolutely nothing the whole day.
[276:35.88]That's good.
[276:37.98]Actually, that was an experiment to see if they could actually do anything.
[276:40.96]It's like, oh, let's get 15 elves to be in a room and do something and make a puzzle.
[276:45.82]They didn't even come close.
[276:46.58]They were just drinking the whole night.

[278:30.49]His podium's bigger than mine.
[278:32.45]I want to replace him.
[278:33.23]Look, it's at least a quarter of an inch higher than mine.
[278:36.18]Podium envy.

[278:42.06]My podium might be one or two inches bigger than yours, but that doesn't matter.
[278:44.60]You need to relax and go back to what you were doing.
[278:46.83]Yeah, get back to what you wreck, please.

[279:17.95]Congratulations!
[279:19.92]This is where it gets very heated.
[279:22.78]Because I know you have a two right here somewhere.
[279:26.52]And ladies and gentlemen, we did it.
[279:38.24]There's no fucking way.
[279:39.90]And then, like, you bet, like, a little bit there, and then maybe I'd be like, you know, what's 50 more?
[279:46.50]You know what I mean?
[279:47.02]It's a nominal amount.
[279:48.78]It's a nominal amount.
[279:49.88]What does that mean?
[279:53.66]Oh.
[279:55.04]Jerma.
[279:56.53]You absolute idiot.
[279:58.85]Am I stupid?
[279:59.59]Because I just won the game.
[280:01.39]That's a three of a kind.
[280:09.83]You just got sharked.
[280:11.59]My music's been buffering all day, so I was going to count until it buffered, but then the music didn't buffer this time, so I've just been counting.
[280:19.41]Rock.
[280:20.45]You just got to get the right leverage.
[280:30.04]Oh, my Lord.
[280:31.54]Hercules.

[280:38.27]Hey, how are you?
[280:39.11]It's me, Deadpool.

[280:44.47]You just missed Jerma.
[280:45.67]Did I?
[280:46.27]Yeah, he was a great guy.
[280:47.42]Oh, he's a fun dude.
[280:48.38]He's fun.
[280:48.78]Kind of a weird guy.
[280:49.72]Kind of a weird guy.
[280:50.40]But I just missed him?
[280:51.58]Just missed him.
[280:52.36]Wow.

[280:55.30]I'm going to take, we're going to make pumpkin pie.
[280:57.12]That's what's going to happen here.
[280:57.96]I've been waiting all week to do this one.
[281:02.39]Alright, get in there.
[281:10.16]I don't think I made it.
[281:11.84]I'm assuming it missed.
[281:12.74]I can't tell.
[281:13.30]Ooh, you know what?
[281:15.22]My lips are jaw right now.
[281:16.36]Oh, are they?
[281:16.88]What?
[281:17.71]What the fuck?
[281:19.63]What?
[281:21.45]Did they get... It just cuts a Jerma doing exercise.
[281:24.17]Wait, what?
[281:24.99]Did they miss that?
[281:25.63]Yeah, it was this Jerma doing this.
[281:27.87]Did they miss that shot?
[281:29.01]I was preparing.
[281:29.63]I was stretching.
[281:30.45]Yeah, and how about you tell us what you have in your pocket earlier?
[281:33.25]Yeah, he's got like a lip balm on a Q-tip.
[281:35.18]You're actually calling me out for this?
[281:36.66]Yeah, pull it out, man.
[281:37.58]I mean, it's not... So, it's...
[281:41.18]That is a gab that you smoke weed out of.
[281:44.98]No, it's not drugs.
[281:46.13]It's in a drug baggie, but it doesn't mean it's drugs.
[282:05.95]You fucking lose!
[282:09.32]You lose!
[282:09.78]That's it!
[282:10.30]That's it!
[282:10.70]You got a little spell over you.
[282:12.86]Congratulations, guys.
[282:13.74]Yes, thank you.
[282:14.30]Congratulations.
[282:15.12]Congratulations.
[282:16.66]I just won.
[282:17.18]That's it.
[282:18.46]Got it under control, though.
[282:19.28]I'm going to land this.
[282:20.14]It's going to be an S-tier pilot, by the way.
[282:22.15]When you all do your reviews, I want you to say thanks for the S-tier landing.
[282:25.31]And have a great rest of your evening landing shore.
[282:29.59]OK.
[282:31.01]Oh, my God!
[282:31.55]Okay.
[282:32.03]Okay.
[282:32.49]Okay.
[282:33.09]Don't worry.
[282:34.41]Oh, my God.
[282:35.93]Jeremiah?
[282:36.49]Yeah?
[282:37.11]If we don't make it out of this one... Yep?
[282:39.61]I just want to let you know, you're a great pilot, okay?
[282:43.10]Thank you so much.
[282:44.30]This may require both of us, alright?
[282:48.10]And by the way, I've got a bag under my bed that has 50 grand in it.
[282:50.84]What?
[282:51.10]I'm trying to make sure somebody knows.
[282:53.10]Push back.
[282:53.66]Oh, boy.
[282:54.52]Okay.
[282:54.90]Push back.
[282:55.47]Okay.
[282:55.83]Hold on.
[282:56.43]To the side.
[282:57.49]There you go. 30.
[282:59.23]Oh, my God!
[282:59.87]Jesus Christ!
[283:03.53]Alright, we're okay!
[283:04.51]We're alright, we're alright!
[283:07.94]Alright!
[283:09.52]Oh, my God!
[283:10.50]Oh, my God!
[283:12.02]We're on the ground!
[283:13.44]Oh, we made it!
[283:14.18]We're on the ground!
[283:14.89]We made it!
[283:16.47]Oh, my God!
[283:17.39]I may have swished my balls, but it's okay.
[283:21.67]Hey, wait a minute.
[283:22.93]We got a guest here.
[283:24.15]We got the amazing Gemma.
[283:26.02]Everybody clap.
[283:27.14]Oh.
[283:28.16]Hello.
[283:28.92]Oh, my god.
[283:29.68]It's you.
[283:30.00]How are you?
[283:30.30]Oh, Donna, it's such a wonderful time to see you.
[283:32.82]Yes.
[283:33.60]Sit here?
[283:34.20]Yeah, you may sit there.
[283:35.29]OK, sit here.
[283:36.37]Now, I hear you put on the biggest production of Guys and Dolls Twitch has ever seen.
[283:41.29]Well, you'll get close.
[283:42.39]Who's this tweet about?
[283:43.35]Alright.
[283:44.87]A reply to Jerma985.
[283:47.70]Alright.
[283:48.36]Or is it a reply to super galactic porn star Mia Malkova?
[283:52.34]That fat, juicy ass.
[283:54.38]Fat spelled with a P-H.
[283:56.00]P-H.
[283:58.46]Which is the good.
[283:59.96]Yeah.
[284:01.20]I'm going to say 2020.
[284:02.17]I'm going to say this is about me.
[284:05.99]Wow.
[284:06.93]Alright.
[284:07.37]What do you think, Donna?
[284:09.96]Am I missing something?
[284:11.62]I'm gonna say me and Malkova.
[284:13.38]I would like to say Jerma is a little full of himself.
[284:18.32]It is me and Malkova.
[284:21.44]I got one of that tweet of me showing my ass in the mirror.
[284:26.63]What?
[284:27.47]Anyway, let's take a look at some of our competitors.
[284:30.25]Jerma.
[284:32.21]What question did you ask me earlier?
[284:33.69]I asked you what the accelerate button was.
[284:37.15]Who's your teammate?
[284:38.23]You.
[284:39.97]Okay, let's go see how other people are doing.
[284:41.51]Are you sipping it right now?
[284:42.85]No, I just opened it.
[284:44.47]It's harder to chug a cold beer.
[284:45.87]You know that.
[284:47.23]Yeah, but it tastes better.
[284:48.96]You don't chug for taste.
[284:51.58]Everything is taste.
[284:52.66]Everything.
[284:53.34]You can't just chug.
[284:54.00]What do you mean, taste?
[284:54.68]This is a typical Golden Knights fan.
[284:58.16]They almost won the goddamn Stanley Cup the first year, by the way.
[285:00.94]They did.
[285:02.00]How long ago was that?
[285:03.20]That's not great.
[285:04.30]You don't love that for them.
[285:05.54]I used to do that when it turned out.
[285:08.38]By the way, I don't really like Mario Kart.
[285:10.58]What?
[285:11.36]Why did you accept doing this?
[285:13.15]Because I think you're cool.
[285:15.47]Really?
[285:15.91]Yeah.
[285:16.47]Oh, thank you.
[285:17.79]Statistically, those ones do, actually.
[285:20.03]No, exactly.
[285:22.51]Thinking about fucking toting this next last round.
[285:25.23]You want to fuck Toad?
[285:26.39]Is that what he just said?
[285:35.66]I will say something before I open this.
[285:38.08]That thanks to all the other streamers that let me kind of participate in their shows,
[285:46.58]Because it's fun, and I hope that you liked it.
[285:49.68]I hope you thought it was fun, maybe participating in everything.
[285:52.81]I did a lot of stuff this year.
[285:55.79]So there's a lot of people doing really, really cool shit on these platforms.
[285:59.55]So it's an honor to be able to participate and have fun.
[286:03.39]So thank you, all these nominees, everybody that's in here.
[286:07.65]It's been a lot of fun.
[286:08.57]It has.
[286:09.85]Thank you.
[286:10.35]I actually do mean that.
[286:11.13]Thank you so much for letting me be part of your cool shit.
[286:15.15]But what was everybody's favorite?
[286:18.55]They're all good.
[286:21.07]What do we got here?
[286:21.89]Who is the favorite collab of the year?
[286:24.67]Ladies and gentlemen, it is... Ooh, close.
[286:28.61]28% of the vote and then two was 25.6.
[286:31.67]Number one was Tommy Time with Critical.
[286:43.21]which was so much fun.
[286:44.89]That whole group is so awesome.
[286:46.81]That was an unbelievable experience.
[286:48.23]Name your price with Austin's show at number two.
[286:52.55]And then bro versus bro, bro versus bro with Ludwig.
[286:55.48]Bro versus bro.
[286:57.10]Ludwig is here.
[286:58.28]So Ludwig, you came in third place on best collab stream.
[287:01.60]I don't know if he's even here anymore.
[287:06.36]But yeah, that...
[287:08.27]That means a lot.
[287:09.23]It means a lot to be able to be a part of other people's shows.
[287:12.29]I hope I made them more fun.
[287:14.45]And if I didn't, then maybe I won't get a call back.
[287:17.81]Alright.
[287:19.65]Alright, don't get sentimental.
[287:21.04]Don't start crying.
[287:22.24]There's a lot of people watching you.
[287:24.74]You probably heard that weird burp.
[287:26.76]We're getting to the last two categories.
[287:28.54]There's only two left.
[287:30.28]There's best overall stream or series and best overall event.
[287:35.21]We can start with this one here.
[287:37.62]It's been kind of a wild year and there's a lot to go over.
[287:42.02]So I guess I don't need to introduce this too much.
[287:46.57]This is the nominees for the best stream or stream series of the year.
[287:51.81]And here they are.
[288:01.44]You guys are losing your fucking minds.

[294:42.55]I missed.
[294:46.47]This was so fun.
[294:50.95]I'm just a psycho.
[294:52.49]I'm sorry.
[294:53.45]No, I don't mean... I don't... Alright, you can arrest me.
[294:57.53]I don't know.
[294:58.19]This is weird.
[294:58.81]Everybody looking at me.
[294:59.99]Don't look at me.
[295:03.97]What the fuck?
[295:04.81]That was like a monster.
[295:09.18]I'm trying to snap his neck.
[295:16.98]Strangle him.
[295:17.96]I'm trying to strangle him.
[295:22.60]HEY!
[295:22.78]GIVE ME THAT GUN MOTHERFUCKER!
[295:25.60]This is the back... of this- AHH!
[295:28.66]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[295:30.76]Holy shit, that was- that was like the worst thing that ever happened to me.
[295:33.44]You just stole Austin Powers' mojo.
[295:36.82]Jesus.
[295:38.34]Give me a fucking... bri- That was fucked up.
[295:48.84]That was actually pretty fun.
[296:00.53]I'm sorry.
[296:01.33]I can't do it.
[296:02.55]What is what is we have one minute and 15 seconds to go this way Where did you go we're going up Oh coffee Get off the fucking barrel get off the barrel that was awful Get off the barrel
[296:35.05]I don't like this.
[296:35.83]I hate this.
[296:39.35]Oh, holy shit.
[296:40.83]People are so ugly with light, aren't they?
[296:43.53]Holy shit.
[296:44.03]People are so ugly.
[296:45.37]Look at alright.
[296:47.03]Oh, Jerma, you look real handsome today.
[296:48.52]You sure about that?
[296:56.49]Oh, no, he killed that guy.
[296:57.87]What?
[296:58.99]Oh, my God.
[296:59.87]I am so confused right now.
[297:05.65]There you go.
[297:06.86]I told you it was real.
[297:08.92]Hey, let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed.
[297:10.72]Don't make a joke.
[297:11.56]Stop.
[297:18.22]Oh my God, what am I doing?
[297:19.38]If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead.
[297:30.60]I don't get that move at all.
[297:31.99]That move is absolutely unbelievable.
[297:35.09]It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.
[297:37.03]And I'm telling you, yeah.
[297:39.67]You know what else is as ridiculous as that?
[297:41.63]Yeah, like we're going to get planes soon.
[297:43.33]Like I can fly eventually too.
[297:52.65]So those are your nominees for best stream or stream series of the year.
[297:56.13]I feel like there are a lot of good ones.
[297:59.29]I feel like there was a lot of fun this year.
[298:01.93]I say that every year, but I do mean it.
[298:03.73]And let's see.
[298:04.58]I'm gonna start crying on camera, right?
[298:08.28]I'm gonna start, I'm gonna cry.
[298:09.68]It's gonna happen.
[298:10.96]Just wait.
[298:11.30]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the, what you have decided was the best stream or stream series of the year.
[298:22.30]Oh, the misery, no.
[298:24.40]Elden Ring at 27.2%.
[298:27.20]And let me tell you, it makes sense considering I streamed that game for almost two straight months.
[298:34.02]There was a high chance it was gonna be Elden Ring, because it was a third of every stream I did this year.
[298:40.24]And also Game of the Year, by the way.
[298:43.28]Elden Ring at 27.2.
[298:45.44]Underneath that is infomercial React Andy.
[298:50.17]I'm gonna have to do more of those React Andy streams because, okay.
[298:55.88]And then Breath, I didn't even beat Breath of the Wild yet, but Breath of the Wild number three.
[299:01.08]By the way, this is second most least skipped category.
[299:04.28]So people wanted to vote for this.
[299:06.49]But Elden Ring, obviously Elden Ring swept everything, swept the Game Awards, swept my awards, right?
[299:11.45]So obviously it's gonna win.
[299:13.99]And it was so fun.
[299:15.09]Those are some of the, honestly, those are some of the funnest streams I had.
[299:19.78]I think, ever on the channel.
[299:22.24]That game just had so many fun moments.
[299:25.94]Once in a generation, you get it.
[299:28.41]Alright.
[299:30.55]Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.
[299:32.87]We are approaching the final category, which is a small category, but it's fun to do.
[299:39.23]The last category of the evening is best overall stream event.
[299:44.90]There was only about four or five this year.
[299:48.67]I love doing events, I think they're fun.
[299:51.11]Get people together, have a good time.
[299:53.51]This is an event.
[299:55.30]Can't vote for this, though, but hey, maybe you can next year.
[299:58.56]Hey, maybe jot it down for, you know, best event of the year, the Sherman 985 holiday Christmas stream.
[300:05.58]But yeah, this is gonna be it.
[300:06.72]This is the last category of the evening, is what you thought the best stream of the year was that was a event stream.
[300:13.88]We did non-event, here is event.
[300:16.34]Here are your nominees.
[300:22.82]Most least.
[300:26.52]So what I've decided to do is, over the last few months, we've scoured the country trying to find who I think could potentially be able to replace me.
[300:39.45]And a little bit of Ashby.
[300:40.91]Alright.
[300:42.77]Gray.
[300:44.81]And another one here.
[300:46.81]Alright, then we got a little.
[300:49.39]Might be a little too much.
[300:50.31]Oh, a little bit, a little bit too much.
[300:51.79]I'll pull back on the shpeedy.
[300:53.17]Pull back on the shpeedy.
[300:54.47]Alright, you got it.
[300:56.19]Everybody had three jokes.
[300:57.37]We're rats.
[301:00.93]We're rats.
[301:03.84]We pray at night.
[301:06.40]We stalk at night.
[301:10.32]We're rats.
[301:12.68]You think you can beat me?
[301:13.60]I know I can beat you.
[301:14.38]I don't know what I'm gonna beat you at.
[301:15.72]Oh, you know you can beat me.
[301:16.72]Go ahead and cue the music.
[301:18.46]Good luck.
[301:20.01]Weird Monopoly, man.
[301:23.65]Swedish Monopoly, man.
[301:30.05]Hey everybody, what's going on?
[301:31.69]It's me, the sus guy.
[301:32.43]I've been muted this whole time.

[302:01.72]It's definitely these two!
[302:02.56]It's these two!
[302:03.98]It's definitely these two!
[302:05.13]It's these two!
[302:05.89]No!
[302:06.05]It's these two!
[302:06.43]It's these two!
[302:06.81]Help!

[302:31.08]Kill him!
[302:31.30]I can't do it!
[302:31.70]Kill him!
[302:32.06]I don't know how to do it!
[302:33.10]Kill him!
[302:33.40]Do it!
[302:33.60]Do it!
[302:33.84]I don't know how to do it!

[302:36.12]How do you do it?
[302:36.82]Do it!
[302:37.84]Kill him!
[302:38.38]I don't know how to do it!
[302:40.74]What?
[302:41.19]What are you doing?
[302:42.51]What?
[302:42.63]What?
[302:42.91]I agree.
[302:43.65]Get this guy out of here.
[302:44.43]Get this guy out of here.
[302:45.23]Get this guy out of here.
[302:46.03]How do we get this guy out of here?
[302:47.25]I turned around.
[302:48.91]Criken jump scared me.
[302:49.89]No one's listening.
[302:56.61]Okay, I should probably be on this camera right now.
[303:00.59]He should look directly at you.
[303:02.07]Okay, alright, okay, okay, it's my birthday, everyone quiet.
[303:07.81]Happy birthday.
[303:08.61]So, by the way, can I just say... I should be on the wide camera for this one.
[303:12.38]No, this is... No, we have 47 seconds.
[303:14.24]There's only 40 seconds.
[303:19.15]Welcome to Car Shield Field where we have Jerma Baseball Association action for you tonight.
[303:26.51]A big time matchup between the California Circus and the Maryland Magicians.
[303:32.01]You like that call from Elbertson behind home plate.
[303:35.15]Sometimes you're not sure where the pitch missed.
[303:37.07]Elbertson always lets you know.
[303:41.09]Make magic slowly.
[303:42.23]Oh!
[303:43.69]What a play!
[303:45.21]Oh, we got our first pie in the face.
[303:47.27]Elbertson, pie in the face.
[303:50.15]Elbertson.
[303:51.87]The circus wanted that play called dead because... Oh, and he is tossed.
[303:56.92]Is this... We got a streaker!
[304:00.92]We've got a streaker, ladies and gentlemen.
[304:03.40]Before the JBA, the math may be a little bit off.
[304:06.23]Look at this.
[304:06.81]He's pulled it down the line.
[304:08.19]It's fair.
[304:09.27]Elbertson speeding past first.
[304:11.59]He's thinking two.
[304:13.07]Throw comes in the second.
[304:14.59]Oh, he takes a quick turnaround and a good decision by crew chief Elbertson.
[304:19.82]He rules himself safe at first.
[304:22.28]And that one's in for the cost.
[304:24.38]Strike 0-2, and oh my goodness, everyone clearing the dugout for the magic, for the magicians.
[304:30.39]Oh my goodness, this is bad.
[304:32.47]Feed him to the lions.
[304:35.41]Yeah, feed him.
[304:36.75]Feed him to the lions, don't you think?
[304:38.21]But you know what's not byahu?
[304:42.79]And what's not cool?
[304:44.71]Drugs and alcohol.
[304:45.75]Hello again, Steve.

[305:38.06]The winner of best event of the year.
[305:40.47]There's only about four or five of them, so let's see.
[305:43.11]It's gonna be close.
[305:44.59]It's not close.
[305:46.15]It's not close at all.
[305:49.43]42.7% of the vote is the Jerma Baseball Association.
[305:53.83]And then the Sus guy finally plays Among Us.
[305:57.59]Above Who Will Replace Me, which the Sus guy was 24.5%, and Who Will Replace Me at 19.4.
[306:05.76]This was also the least skipped category of the year.
[306:10.88]People wanted to vote for this.
[306:13.00]And that's it.
[306:14.76]So I am going to say goodnight.

[306:45.16]Okay, cool.
