[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.31]What up?
[00:03.39]Hey guys.
[00:06.57]You can probably tell by the title.
[00:10.77]Labolia.
[00:14.36]Hold on.
[00:16.48]Hold on, I had to detonate my room.
[00:24.20]Hold on a second.
[00:24.68]Close the closet before anybody screams at me.
[00:26.68]There's nobody in there, I just checked.
[00:32.65]Change the title?
[00:33.29]What do you mean?
[00:35.57]Cardboard VR?
[00:36.45]What's wrong with that?
[00:40.47]Is Cardboard VR not a good title?
[00:48.99]No.
[00:50.25]Not really.
[00:50.81]It's not... Does it have to be funny?
[00:54.49]Set your expectations real low, guys.
[00:56.69]This is a Labo stream.
[01:05.74]It's too funny.
[01:06.68]I don't know, how about like... How else would you describe what we're doing?
[01:21.49]This is Labo VR, it's Cardboard VR.
[01:25.90]I'm to the point.
[01:39.13]Every time Jerma says Labo, drink.
[01:42.02]Labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo, labo.
[01:45.52]Hope it's water.
[01:56.91]What?
[01:57.09]There's nothing wrong with the title.
[02:02.39]Alright.
[02:03.31]We're keeping it.
[02:04.01]It's staying the way it is.
[02:11.69]Anyways, so we've got to talk about the Labo VR in particular, but I've got to... First of all, this is a special occasion.
[02:19.42]We only do Labo VR.
[02:22.10]Well, we never do Labo VR.
[02:24.36]We've never done Labo VR, but we only do Labo once.
[02:27.48]Labo.
[02:33.68]Hey!
[02:35.20]We only do Labo like once a year, three times a year.
[02:39.66]So I've got the finest fuckin' grocery store wine you could possibly find.
[02:44.50]That shit looks kinda good.
[02:47.30]I couldn't really, this is hard to get this over.
[02:50.28]So let's go ahead, diaper bulge.
[02:53.60]Get outta here.
[02:55.02]We're gonna do a little bit of a, I'm gonna pop it, and we're gonna say, start the lab-o, you ready?
[03:05.91]Start the lab-o!
[03:07.67]That was the same audio clip.
[03:12.19]Anyways, where's my glass?
[03:13.81]Right there.
[03:14.71]Let's see.
[03:18.89]This is not going to be good.
[03:20.87]No, I can't say shit like that.
[03:22.73]If I say shit like that, I don't want to slander our company.
[03:25.57]It's probably good.
[03:29.78]Okay.
[03:33.60]Glass.
[03:36.06]Hint of old Tide dishwasher soap.
[03:41.12]Hard water.
[03:43.81]And sediment.
[03:45.21]Oh, this sounds good.
[03:46.69]Okay, but I probably shouldn't do this over the Labo.
[03:50.19]Where should I do this?
[03:51.35]This is dangerous.
[03:59.98]Did you hear that?
[04:00.62]It made the pouring sound and nothing even came out.
[04:03.14]Listen to this.
[04:07.86]I can't even show you.
[04:11.28]Did you hear that?
[04:21.33]Let it aerate.
[04:22.69]Don't do a heavy pour.
[04:25.11]There you go.
[04:26.37]This is called Copper and Thief.
[04:30.06]This was selected by the Seller Master Select.
[04:33.28]It's probably going to be good.
[04:35.46]Alright, let me just move my diaper out of the way.
[04:37.96]I had to wear a diaper for this stream just because I could just shit and piss in here.
[04:41.49]It's going to be a while.
[04:43.62]You're also probably noticing, excuse me, Jeremy, what's going on with these?
[04:48.08]Are these new?
[04:48.82]What is this?
[04:49.68]This doesn't look like yours.
[04:52.16]Well, I think my Switch might be permanently dead.
[04:57.94]This is a Etalyx's Switch.
[05:00.78]So, I haven't turned on the Switch in a long time.
[05:06.49]It's been like at least three months.
[05:11.69]It hasn't even been plugged in.
[05:16.32]It won't turn on.
[05:18.46]I think the lithium battery in it is permanently dead.
[05:21.84]This wasn't $60, by the way.
[05:23.41]I'm moving this.
[05:24.49]Like over here.
[05:26.09]So now you fucking sickos can talk shit about my life.
[05:33.19]How did you break it?
[05:33.87]I didn't break it.
[05:35.16]It won't turn on.
[05:37.46]It won't charge.
[05:38.62]I can't even get it to the screen.
[05:40.14]Hey, it's charging screen to pop up.
[05:41.86]Whatever.
[05:42.18]Let's try this.
[05:48.99]It's like, what is in here?
[05:51.83]It's like pieces of wood in here.
[05:53.33]Did I fuck this up already?
[06:01.13]That's sweet!
[06:02.57]There's some sweetness here.
[06:03.41]It's almost like a Jolly Rancher.
[06:08.31]What's this one called?
[06:10.15]This is a, okay, this is a Bourbon Red Wine.
[06:12.72]Bourbon Red Wine.
[06:14.56]Does that mean it's extra?
[06:16.32]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[06:18.16]I need a... whatever, this is a fuck you table, who cares.
[06:21.27]Welcome to- this is Nintendo Labo, if you don't know.
[06:22.99]We're gonna do the VR kit.
[06:26.13]The weird thing about the VR kit is the VR kit, for some reason, decided to release in like three different packages.
[06:34.53]So this is the blaster and the headset.
[06:41.82]They sold out of the regular one.
[06:45.02]So I had to, I went around looking all over the place for where I could get the other kits.
[06:51.59]This thing right here, this like big camera elephant trunk, this shit's gonna take about four hours to build.
[07:04.13]This is the longest build in Labo history.
[07:09.62]This is going to take a long time.
[07:10.66]So I'm actually kind of glad I only have the two here.
[07:13.18]Because it's going to be like a six hour build just for these two.
[07:16.96]Plus I've already wasted like 12 minutes.
[07:19.70]So, you know, that's what I do.
[07:22.42]Hope you're ready for a long stream.
[07:24.35]And by the way, only drink alcohol responsibly.
[07:26.95]And only if it's legal in your city.
[07:30.67]You know, drink responsibly.
[07:32.69]Only drink when you're going to build a labo in the comfort of your home.
[07:35.71]With wine.
[07:36.25]Don't do it ever again.
[07:38.43]Alright, let's go.
[07:39.86]Let me get it on the screen.
[07:44.80]There it is.
[07:46.30]You probably remember this setup here.
[07:48.00]Is it gonna take a week?
[07:49.71]No, it's not gonna take a week.
[07:52.71]Alright, what else we got?
[07:53.77]Get that out of here.
[08:01.51]It looks like I have a wicked fat stomach, do I?
[08:05.61]No.
[08:06.43]This ain't moving from here.
[08:08.19]This is, like, staying right fucking here.
[08:10.11]I'm not taking this anywhere else.
[08:13.33]Alright, so, let's go.
[08:14.77]We're gonna build the headset first.
[08:19.39]Uh, we should have that good to go.
[08:20.65]I am ready.
[08:22.25]We're gonna make the... I think we're gonna make the goggles first.
[08:27.66]No, I don't... Do we have to practice?
[08:28.92]I already know how to do this.
[08:34.37]Is this, okay, what a waste of paper.
[08:40.71]They put this in every single Labo.
[08:44.65]It's this one right here.
[08:46.49]This is like the little french fry cup holder thing.
[08:48.89]Alright, I don't need this right now.
[08:52.18]Put that out of the way.
[08:53.20]Actually, I don't need this whole thing.
[08:54.58]Okay, let's go ahead and just do it.
[08:57.42]I know how to do this shit.
[08:58.90]That's not my first ever time.
[09:02.31]Alright, yeah, there it is.
[09:03.15]Alright, just to give you a rundown how this works, you get a cardboard cutout here, and you flip it over, and it's grooves.
[09:11.79]And what you do is you fold the grooves and you turn it into a little device.
[09:16.85]Put the wine on the desk.
[09:18.01]It's gonna be fine.
[09:19.61]Because this whole thing's going on the ground.
[09:22.09]I'm putting on fucking pants.
[09:23.89]I'm gonna go get, like, just jogging pants and put them on.
[09:27.09]There's no way this stream's happening like this.
[09:28.59]Alright, that looks good over there.
[09:36.05]You guys got me so fucking self-conscious every day.
[09:40.01]I can't wear like, I cannot wear these pants.
[09:45.22]You guys are all immature.
[09:47.26]Hey, grow up a little bit.
[09:48.56]Alright, here we go, you ready?
[09:51.36]So we got this piece here.
[09:55.66]I can't even like see.
[10:01.62]Like this, I already know how to do, I gotta get a trash bag in here.
[10:04.40]It's gonna be a long night.
[10:08.35]I already know how to do this.
[10:11.13]I've done it like six times already.
[10:16.43]Don't grow up too much or you'll wind up like Jerma985.
[10:18.79]Yeah, don't grow up too much!
[10:22.37]I can't wait til... I got a plan, by the way, to how to get you, that's right, you, sitting there right now, you're gonna get to see Nintendo Labo for yourself.
[10:29.65]Oh my god, it almost just happened within five minutes.
[10:31.87]Okay, I'll listen to that guy.
[10:38.67]So it folds like this, and then like that.
[10:44.48]Tab goes in here, as you can see.
[10:48.86]Got the little Nintendo Labo sign.
[10:51.88]By the way, just want to make this real clear, I am the only motherfucker on this whole website.
[10:56.88]On the whole website, I'm the only fucking person on the whole website that does this.
[11:03.25]You're not going to find this anywhere else.
[11:04.95]You will never find somebody do what you see here, building a Labo on the whole website.
[11:10.21]Find me another streamer.
[11:12.39]Hasn't ever happened.
[11:15.54]I'm the Labo guy.
[11:16.70]That's like the Jerma, the Labo guy, 985.
[11:19.38]I can't wait until Nintendo invites me to the next Labo premiere event.
[11:25.49]Because I'm the only fucking person that's made any content of this goddamn game.
[11:32.75]Oh, we're here at the Nintendo Lab event here with the exclusive streamers and YouTubers that are really, really into the game and series.
[11:39.29]Look who's coming down the aisle.
[11:40.71]Who's coming out of the limo?
[11:42.55]Oh, it's JustGerma985.
[11:43.73]He's the only fucking person.
[11:46.61]I should just get on stage and do a fucking speech.
[11:52.76]It's coming down the aisle.
[11:53.68]It's in a grocery store.
[11:55.46]That's where the event is.
[11:56.26]It's not even at like a cool theater.
[11:59.10]We're like the mayonnaise aisle.
[12:00.66]Alright, here we go.
[12:08.44]Don't swear, stop swearing.
[12:11.60]I know I can rotate the camera around with a little tool here.
[12:20.77]I never thought this was ever gonna happen.
[12:25.10]But this is actual stomach sitting on table.
[12:31.96]That's not like clothes.
[12:33.64]This is why I don't fucking ever turn on a camera.
[12:37.30]Alright, I know what I'm doing, let's go.
[12:39.08]So you tilt, you can zoom in by holding, yeah, you go like this.
[12:47.54]Yeah, I got the boomer belly.
[12:58.25]Reset the camera by pressing X. We've got our little toy.
[13:00.71]Can you see?
[13:01.83]Is it showing up well?
[13:02.63]Because this stream's about to go off the fucking rails.
[13:09.97]Just wait until you get to play VR, though.
[13:11.33]We're going to share it.
[13:13.37]This camera right here is going in the headset.
[13:15.01]I was going to do two, but it was impossible.
[13:17.88]There's no way it was going to fit in there.
[13:20.50]Can you turn the music up a little louder?
[13:21.78]You want the music louder?
[13:22.74]The music sucks.
[13:24.44]No, it doesn't.
[13:25.66]Alright.
[13:26.12]I already did this.
[13:26.72]Let's just skip it.
[13:29.09]But these are cool.
[13:30.21]These are really cool.
[13:30.79]It takes a while to build.
[13:31.61]You can get your friends over, grab a bottle of wine, and do it.
[13:41.56]Do it.
[13:41.94]I just thought about something right there that I'm gonna go get in a minute.
[13:44.97]But we'll do that on the first wine break.
[13:46.69]I just thought about, you can just see the cogs turning in my brain.
[13:50.95]They were just spinning.
[13:56.62]Box wine?
[13:57.16]This is actually bottle wine tonight, not box wine.
[14:01.00]Write it down?
[14:02.02]No, I will not forget.
[14:03.68]Don't worry.
[14:04.10]Okay, on to the real thing.
[14:05.02]Let's build the headset.
[14:10.08]Oh.
[14:15.92]Sweatshirt!
[14:17.26]We're good?
[14:19.62]Alright, so we're gonna do the pedal.
[14:21.81]What do you mean, pedal?
[14:40.77]What?
[14:46.01]No.
[14:46.73]No, no, no, no, this is wrong.
[14:48.15]Hold on, I'll fix this.
[15:01.16]Always keep a backup switch!
[15:10.56]Uh, yeah.
[15:12.12]It was in the other Switch.
[15:13.84]That's right.
[15:14.60]This like, rich, and I have to do the whole thing again.
[15:19.36]God damn it.
[15:20.92]They, look, how, look, give me a break.
[15:23.43]You see how easy this is to fucking fuck this up?
[15:25.99]They're like this big.
[15:27.29]They're this big.
[15:28.59]Hold on.
[15:36.09]You can't even read it in a microscope to read the text on here.
[15:50.34]I'm not building that thing again.
[15:51.48]I already did it.
[15:56.50]For a second, I thought they put the wrong thing in the blocks.
[15:58.36]I was like, there's no fucking way that somebody would do that.
[16:02.14]Right?
[16:02.46]There's no way.
[16:04.44]Alright.
[16:05.68]Okay.
[16:10.17]Everybody can relax.
[16:18.47]I'm ready.
[16:24.30]Your controllers have to be updated.
[16:27.88]Alright, let's go.
[16:30.52]Do, do, what, should I not hold it?
[16:32.23]Is there, like, radiation coming in here?
[16:34.45]That, like, kind of freaks me out sometimes.
[16:40.69]Is there, like, electromagnetic fields, like, going, I feel like it's going to interfere if I pick it up.
[16:46.14]You're going to get super powers if you just hold on to it.
[16:48.02]Well, might as well start drinking.
[16:53.10]Ah!
[16:55.68]Oh!
[16:56.30]Oh!
[16:59.66]I can't fucking do that.
[17:00.72]These are not mine.
[17:06.84]I just saw, haha.
[17:08.56]You got like, you got like a hundred more of those to do tonight.
[17:11.50]Just gonna tell you.
[17:15.12]This is a fucking Nintendo Labo stream.
[17:19.48]I guarantee you, if somebody keeps track of that, they'll be at least fucking, each one of you will do that like fucking 30 times.
[17:29.19]Lick it.
[17:29.51]Why would I?
[17:29.87]This is not mine.
[17:30.67]I don't lick things that are not mine.
[17:36.35]You're using up the supply.
[17:37.29]You get the idea, though.
[17:38.31]Fucking tell me, like, cringey.
[17:46.58]I'll fucking dare you.
[17:50.32]What do you have?
[17:52.24]I would love to have that one, Nintendo, but you only made, like, a certain amount of them, and you can't buy them anywhere.
[17:59.81]They were so scared that people didn't want to spend $80 on the whole thing that they made half of those and half of these.
[18:06.47]I don't have this one, I have this one.
[18:14.29]Lick the cartridge.
[18:17.25]It's not a rat tail, it's my hair coming down.
[18:21.07]Look, restrict the use of VR mode for children six and under.
[18:28.23]VR mode is only suitable for players aged seven and above.
[18:31.97]Kids, please check with an adult.
[18:33.57]Do you want to allow the use of VR mode?
[18:37.11]Six and under.
[18:40.93]Alright.
[18:46.55]You can adjust your VR mode settings here at any time.
[18:48.93]I don't have it yet.
[18:50.29]I need to make the VR headset.
[18:53.27]No, I already did it.
[19:00.75]Isn't there a skip?
[19:03.87]Welcome to Nintendo Labo.
[19:05.41]Here, we're gonna show you how to make the fuckin' pencil holder.
[19:09.11]Alright, I already did it.
[19:11.48]Just skip.
[19:14.12]Wait, wait, what was that?
[19:19.30]What's that thing?
[19:20.04]What's the guy?
[19:20.94]There's more?
[19:25.17]Oh shit, they never used A before completely.
[19:32.77]I know, I can't fucking believe we do this again.
[19:34.39]Put them wrong.
[19:36.73]Didn't lick the cartridge.
[19:38.66]I'm not gonna lick that cartridge.
[19:42.08]Guys, this thing said it was gonna take like five hours to build it.
[19:45.34]And it's been 20 fucking minutes and I've done the wrong cartridge.
[19:47.86]We're gonna be here all night.
[19:54.35]Lick the cartridge.
[19:55.71]Why would you ever, what world would you want to live on to do that?
[20:00.87]I'm not licking the cartridge.
[20:03.89]You, okay, you got, you're doing this wrong.
[20:07.54]I really hate to blow this up here, but I've had like three sips of wine and you're already asking me to do weird fucked up shit.
[20:14.24]I know now that like future drunk Jeremy is not going to do that.
[20:19.00]You've ruined it.
[20:19.52]You could have done that like in two hours and I would have done it.
[20:22.71]Now I know.
[20:28.39]I mean, that's your fault, not mine.
[20:34.67]He's not going to do it.
[20:37.07]I already know.
[20:40.23]My internal monologue right now is locked in that I'm not going to lick that cartridge.
[20:45.30]It's locked in and then nothing that can be done is not going to change.
[20:47.86]It's not going to happen.
[20:49.26]It's already locked in.
[20:54.84]I can't believe I can't do all the other ones.
[20:56.80]Alright, this is going to take 30 to 60 minutes.
[20:58.98]In Jeremy's stream times, that's like two hours.
[21:02.62]It's not going to take 30 minutes.
[21:05.32]We're gonna make the actual goggles that go on your face.
[21:11.58]Wait, is it actual glass?
[21:19.30]You actually put like a piece of glass in there.
[21:25.43]Making the Toy-Con VR goggles.
[21:29.61]Four steps you need to complete.
[21:31.73]This is really actually cool.
[21:34.37]VR lenses, VR goggles, the safety cap, and then prepare to play.
[21:40.35]We don't need this anymore.
[21:45.69]It's getting recycled, don't worry.
[21:46.83]Everyone's like, oh, you're gonna break it.
[21:47.95]It's getting recycled, don't worry.
[21:50.33]Alright, so we need the VR lenses.
[21:53.31]Dip it in the wine, no thanks.
[21:55.21]The VR lenses are inside this box, but hold on a second.
[22:01.27]Don't go opening this box yet, there's some warnings first.
[22:17.67]There's a snake in here!
[22:19.37]That's the warning!
[22:20.07]Ah, Nintendo, you got me!
[22:26.83]Wait, what is the warning?
[22:33.82]Morning, never use the VR lenses to look at the sun or any other bright lights.
[22:38.42]You could damage your eyes!
[22:46.27]Should I try it?
[22:48.15]It's pretty bright out right there.
[22:49.23]No, I'm not damaging my eyes for the sake of fucking comedy, no way.
[22:53.55]Never place the VR lenses in direct sunlight or near a light source.
[22:56.35]Concentrated light can burn nearby objects.
[23:03.09]What are they talking about?
[23:07.41]If these lenses are facing a certain way, I can burn my house down?
[23:12.85]Alright, what about warning three?
[23:16.04]No, alright, so let me see.
[23:17.60]These are dangerous, apparently.
[23:20.16]Don't look directly at the sun.
[23:25.98]Alright, look at this you got.
[23:27.54]I know we're not doing this yet, but just look at this.
[23:30.36]Look at this image on the left here.
[23:33.57]That looks like a superpower.
[23:36.79]That like looks cool enough to, you know what I mean?
[23:38.59]That looks like somebody's shooting fire out of their eyes.
[23:46.16]Is that really possible?
[23:47.40]Alright, well, there they are.
[23:52.00]Is that the only thing that's in there?
[23:54.22]There's something else in here.
[23:58.86]I have to test it.
[24:00.86]maybe maybe but no it's it's the sun's gone this it's not that no I don't have I don't have a direct sunlight here try to like do it like over here and like beam over here it's too bad it's not like noon I don't think this is not for anything alright so what do we need we need a sheet a I'm gonna move this out of the way now
[24:26.20]There's nothing else in the box.
[24:27.18]I'm going to put it back in here, though, just to keep it safe because it's dangerous.
[24:37.48]I remember the sun.
[24:38.37]No, I mean, the sun's not at its peak right now.
[24:42.15]It is currently, it's 4.30, 4.30 p.m.
[24:48.55]Pacific Daylight Time.
[24:49.87]So it means the sun is no longer, it's going down.
[24:52.14]The sun doesn't hit this side anyways.
[24:53.58]Alright, here's the area.
[24:58.84]A. No, not that one.
[25:00.94]It's another.
[25:01.38]It's A2.
[25:01.84]So it's this one.
[25:05.86]Alright, I gotta move this shit out of the way.
[25:07.88]Get the wine out of here before I cause a fucking huge problem.
[25:17.15]Lick the cardboard.
[25:20.67]You guys, I ain't doing any of that shit.
[25:25.79]So here is the main piece here.
[25:28.76]So we're gonna move this big piece here, this big one, the yellow one.
[25:34.92]Punch it out.
[25:37.78]I know you guys, I know you guys missed those satisfying noises, like this one.
[25:43.40]I know you guys missed those satisfying noises.
[25:47.17]Alright, it's a great big yellow one.
[25:52.51]And then I'm assuming we're just gonna punch it around.
[25:55.02]Other pieces of the sheet later, okay.
[25:57.88]Don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back button, yup.
[26:00.36]Alright, these goggles will be your window into a whole new world.
[26:04.39]They're pretty important, so let's make sure to make them right.
[26:07.47]Don't screw it up.
[26:09.23]Be careful not to mix up the front and the back.
[26:11.15]Pay attention to the screen so that you always have the correct side up.
[26:15.88]Like that.
[26:16.54]That's correct.
[26:19.05]No mistakes allowed.
[26:19.93]I don't make mistakes when I play this.
[26:21.47]Make sure you have plenty of space when working on big pieces.
[26:23.60]It might help to put away any pieces you don't need for now.
[26:27.84]Yeah, I'm good.
[26:31.54]I got this.
[26:32.08]I got this completely.
[26:33.24]Alright, flip it over.
[26:37.23]Before we start folding, take a good look at where the fold lines are, right?
[26:40.41]Okay, they're all over the place here.
[26:43.55]Yeah.
[26:45.95]When making fold lines, try to crease the whole length firmly with both hands.
[26:49.13]I know.
[26:49.47]This is our first fold.
[26:51.99]Okay, both hands.
[26:52.80]Crease it.
[26:54.00]Right here.
[26:54.56]Ready?
[26:55.80]First fold of the evening.
[26:56.96]Hey, I want to... Never mind.
[27:02.22]That looks good.
[27:06.29]It's creased.
[27:08.79]I didn't even do the right one.
[27:10.11]I didn't even do the right one.
[27:10.89]I'm not paying attention.
[27:11.73]It's this one.
[27:15.10]Already did it wrong.
[27:16.58]You already did the wrong fold.
[27:18.74]Don't make any mistakes, kids.
[27:21.72]Just make a mistake on the first fold.
[27:23.68]Alright, looks good.
[27:28.72]Good job.
[27:31.00]Yeah, that's nice and creased.
[27:34.64]Now for the two sides, both these come up.
[27:38.62]I think all of them, I'm just gonna do them all this way.
[27:43.01]I gotta punch out this shit too.
[27:47.20]Alright, nice and tight.
[27:51.56]I gotta fucking don't do that.
[27:53.06]I'm gonna make, every time I start to make a room a mess, it just stays a mess forever.
[27:57.72]And I always talk about how I'm gonna clean it, and I never ever do, ever.
[28:02.33]What do you mean ruin?
[28:03.05]What did I do?
[28:03.47]What are you talking about?
[28:06.23]I had to punch the holes out.
[28:07.05]What do you mean ruined?
[28:07.99]Another long-used ball, okay, that one, and then the, yep, right here.
[28:18.84]I didn't, how did I fuck it up?
[28:19.82]What are you talking about?
[28:23.31]How is it fucked up?
[28:28.89]I didn't do anything wrong.
[28:35.79]These both fold in, and then the tabs go, and then I believe this is gonna, ooh, this is where it gets tricky.
[28:43.57]Oh, ruined!
[28:45.35]Oh, he's ruining it!
[28:53.57]This looks good too.
[28:54.39]This fucking shiatsu.
[28:58.73]So that.
[28:59.57]Then these tabs.
[29:01.91]Go down.
[29:02.41]Like that.
[29:05.17]Push that out.
[29:09.34]He's destroying it.
[29:10.52]You guys have never built a fucking labo before.
[29:12.20]You have no idea.
[29:14.22]How many of you have built a labo before?
[29:16.66]Show of hands.
[29:19.16]None of you.
[29:21.68]You know how they say, oh man, yeah, streamer, influencer.
[29:27.73]Yeah, I played Labo.
[29:29.91]I mean, like a lot of people really thought it was cool and they bought it.
[29:32.49]Like a bunch of you guys bought it.
[29:35.66]I don't think any of you bought it.
[29:38.12]I've done this like fucking five times.
[29:40.18]You probably, maybe three of you bought one.
[29:43.68]Like it doesn't do anything.
[29:51.62]Paid off.
[29:52.30]Wait, did I not do this one?
[29:55.74]These tabs fold, right?
[29:56.71]Am I doing the folds wrong?
[29:57.69]I better not be.
[29:59.23]I have a broken.
[29:59.67]It's over.
[30:01.09]Alright, if one piece breaks, I quit.
[30:07.31]These come up.
[30:09.08]Those ones fold over.
[30:13.18]Now we have to get the glass in here.
[30:20.03]Okay, so then that comes over here.
[30:23.36]Get that out of direct sunlight.
[30:24.54]Don't touch that.
[30:26.14]Here we go again.
[30:26.68]I need to know.
[30:32.46]I need to know.
[30:32.96]I'm gonna look at a light.
[30:35.78]Just quickly.
[30:37.90]Are you in there, lenses?
[30:38.80]Come on out.
[30:41.94]Sup?
[30:45.31]Hi there, we're the VR lenses.
[30:46.77]Good to meet you.
[30:50.66]Sorry for all the warnings.
[30:51.86]Please don't peel off the film on the lenses.
[30:55.28]Sorry for all the warnings.
[30:59.03]You are real, ooh.
[31:01.49]Try to avoid touching the round lenses themselves.
[31:03.59]They need to be nice and clean.
[31:06.87]I think I already touched them a bunch.
[31:08.03]Okay, behold the VR lenses.
[31:16.80]Time to attach these guys to the big piece we creased before.
[31:22.15]Alright, hold on.
[31:23.23]Where'd they go?
[31:33.00]So don't, but don't take this off.
[31:41.37]Alright, so don't peel that off.
[31:43.71]So this is going over here.
[31:49.39]Bring it over to the side with the tabs we let standing up and slot it in from below.
[31:57.66]What?
[32:02.81]Like this?
[32:03.27]Okay.
[32:09.11]So those tabs are up, right?
[32:10.61]I did that right.
[32:12.31]I'm not touching the lenses.
[32:14.62]I have not touched the lenses one time.
[32:20.44]Now let's make a quick check.
[32:21.89]Does everything look the same on the screen?
[32:28.71]Yeah?
[32:30.05]Yeah.
[32:33.35]It does.
[32:35.58]I'm gonna have to lick those lenses clean.
[32:37.42]Oh god, remove these two pieces from sheet B. Already going to B. Which ones?
[32:45.12]The two canisters?
[32:53.20]Lick him.
[32:57.68]You guys are fucked.
[33:00.43]Alright, take out the middle.
[33:01.81]Let's punch him in your view so you can see how cool it looks.
[33:04.17]Alright.
[33:12.07]Good.
[33:14.54]So these are identical.
[33:18.36]So then these go on sides like this.
[33:24.11]Hey, we want action too.
[33:26.11]Use these on the round holes as guides.
[33:28.45]Like here.
[33:34.44]To line everything up perfectly, the black side should be facing up.
[33:38.88]Like this.
[33:39.58]Okay.
[33:44.15]This stream's over.
[33:44.87]Oh, because I ripped a little bit.
[33:48.13]You're not even going to fucking see this.
[33:49.41]It's going to be on my head.
[33:52.09]I'm gonna let they fall.
[33:53.87]Oh, fuck.
[33:55.07]Get out the bag with the special parts.
[33:59.36]Are we gonna rubber band this?
[34:00.64]No.
[34:00.92]Here's the special bag.
[34:03.86]Don't look!
[34:05.84]Don't look this directly in the sun!
[34:07.58]Do not put this up to your eye.
[34:08.94]It'll fucking burn your house down.
[34:10.16]Don't do it.
[34:13.07]Alright.
[34:14.51]Two of the gray washers.
[34:22.42]Gray washers.
[34:26.98]There's a lot of gray washers in here.
[34:28.28]There's two of them.
[34:30.74]There's a bag within a bag.
[34:33.50]Only Nintendo.
[34:43.85]And Lego.
[34:45.85]And every other company that makes small, losable parts.
[34:50.27]Okay, two washers.
[34:51.55]Got them.
[34:53.44]Now what?
[34:54.22]I gotta put the seat down.
[34:55.40]This is killing me.
[35:01.08]I'm already sweating.
[35:02.40]It's fucking hot.
[35:03.63]I'm gonna go, like, turn the AC on.
[35:04.93]Alright.
[35:07.81]Two of the gray washers.
[35:13.39]Punch it through here?
[35:14.29]Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:17.04]What if I have to slip the holes in the pieces of the sticky outie bits?
[35:20.26]Wait.
[35:22.29]Slip the holes in the pieces over the sticky-outy bits on the sides of the VR lenses.
[35:32.99]Like this.
[35:41.40]Okay.
[35:42.28]And then a washer over it.
[35:43.44]This is where the washer come in.
[35:46.78]Here goes nothing.
[35:47.30]The washer should snap on like this.
[35:52.81]Okay, so something like that.
[35:55.38]I'm not touching the lens, don't worry, don't freak out.
[35:57.34]Oh, fuck.
[36:06.50]I'm not touching the lens.
[36:09.94]God damn it, get on there!
[36:15.51]Alright, I did touch the lens this time.
[36:19.07]Ah!
[36:21.07]Ah!
[36:26.94]I'm touching all over the lens.
[36:31.01]I swear to God, I can't.
[36:33.91]Oh no.
[36:37.90]Oh my God, why is this so fucking hard to do?
[36:40.62]That's the right side.
[37:02.38]You don't understand.
[37:03.06]It's not working.
[37:13.05]Oh, they really went down in quality, didn't they?
[37:15.79]Says the vehicle.
[37:24.18]I don't understand.
[37:25.08]Guys, it's supposed to just snap on.
[37:28.68]It's supposed to snap on.
[37:49.80]It's not on.
[37:51.44]It's not on.
[37:54.06]I'm not too weak.
[37:59.96]It's just, it's not cut.
[38:00.98]I got it.
[38:01.60]It's not cut right.
[38:02.58]It's not cut right.
[38:03.26]I got a defect.
[38:05.08]You want me to prove that?
[38:06.07]Look at that.
[38:06.45]You want to prove my defect?
[38:09.53]Look at the defect that I have.
[38:13.19]I am defective.
[38:14.69]As you can see, it's warped.
[38:24.42]Same thing on the other side.
[38:26.28]Great.
[38:29.41]Go back.
[38:30.25]I didn't do it wrong.
[38:30.81]What are you talking about?
[38:36.17]No, that's correct.
[38:37.67]Same thing on the other side.
[38:40.78]And that snaps in.
[38:41.64]So he's going to lock it in.
[38:42.50]Let's see if it's as difficult to do this one.
[38:48.50]Because this one doesn't look warped.
[38:53.17]Done.
[38:53.61]In one second.
[38:54.99]This one not warped.
[38:55.73]Let's make sure it's on there good.
[38:59.55]Not even warped.
[39:02.37]Alright, so that's in there now.
[39:04.30]That's done.
[39:08.08]I've got like sediment on my face.
[39:11.10]What are we doing down here?
[39:11.80]Alright.
[39:12.96]Looks good.
[39:13.34]We're going to fold it over.
[39:14.20]The VR lenses are fully attached.
[39:17.72]This piece is taking up a lot of space.
[39:19.44]Let's fold it up a bit to be more compact.
[39:29.83]So this comes up, so we go like that, and then like this, and that comes down here like that.
[39:44.48]Okay, we're making a McDonald's Happy Meal.
[39:49.41]Tuck the cardboard underneath the plastic right here.
[39:52.31]You'll need to do this again later, so remember it well.
[39:59.47]Like that, okay.
[40:04.15]It's in.
[40:05.31]And with that, the VR lenses are ready.
[40:09.58]They are?
[40:09.92]Phew, that was quite the complex piece to start with, but we're not done yet.
[40:15.36]Maybe we ought to take a quick break.
[40:17.18]You got it.
[40:17.60]So how does this go?
[40:19.80]Like this?
[40:31.48]Alright, so that's that.
[40:32.90]Let's go two out of four.
[40:41.67]Windrate.
[40:43.13]Yeah, I got a windrate real quick.
[40:45.89]Alright, so I can move this out of the way.
[40:47.21]Let's get this in a spot where I know where it is.
[40:49.45]Right over here.
[40:51.49]I was going to throw that, but that would be a bad idea.
[40:56.17]Alright, so let's get B, sheet B again.
[41:02.26]I'm going to do the big piece.
[41:03.00]The whole thing.
[41:11.79]Can you bear into my car?
[41:18.37]I don't know what that means.
[41:22.62]Alright, is this the only one we need?
[41:24.40]Just the bead?
[41:30.06]This is going to be a pretty complex shape.
[41:34.56]Apparently.
[41:35.06]So I gotta punch out a lot of this crap.
[41:36.64]Hold on.
[41:40.85]So this is nothing.
[41:41.73]This is just a big three.
[41:44.15]Three.
[41:49.49]And then the middle stays in.
[41:50.90]Now this stays in.
[41:54.60]This pops out.
[41:58.89]He said ear, oh.
[42:00.87]Sorry, my eyes aren't that good.
[42:03.35]It's hard for me to see all the way over there.
[42:14.28]Here comes the counting joke.
[42:17.50]We all think it's so funny to count.
[42:21.78]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[42:24.92]It's my favorite.
[42:27.17]I love it.
[42:28.89]So we've got, this is good.
[42:30.81]Everything's done.
[42:31.39]Okay, this will form the slot into which we insert the console itself.
[42:40.11]Lay it out, printed side up, and look at these fold lines in the middle.
[42:44.62]I see it.
[42:46.12]So this goes across.
[42:49.38]This?
[42:51.42]Is this foldable?
[42:53.18]This doesn't look like it folds.
[42:58.34]I guess it does.
[42:59.16]Uh-oh.
[43:06.63]That.
[43:09.43]OK.
[43:11.62]And then, is volume too low?
[43:17.74]That's better, right?
[43:19.90]Is that a little better?
[43:22.64]no not really it's fine I'll turn it down later don't worry I'll panic go back and forth lowering and increasing the volume over the next four hours alright then this one comes up this way this is a tricky one this is tricky guys alright so that's done and that's done so we got these two folded up
[43:54.26]We should do these flaps at the ends, too.
[43:58.91]Both flaps, yeah.
[44:10.17]You're in the midst of dealing with finals!
[44:12.31]Well, good luck.
[44:12.97]Hopefully you ace them.
[44:15.23]Hopefully you get at least a B-.
[44:16.71]At least come up?
[44:18.63]Yeah, the whole thing does.
[44:26.60]My eyes are getting so bad.
[44:27.64]Let's hope these tabs go up.
[44:31.43]I guess they do.
[44:34.25]One.
[44:35.61]Two!
[44:38.65]That should be it.
[44:39.17]Now we're gonna use the sponge stickers from the bag.
[44:46.58]Sponge stickers?
[44:50.84]Ah, this thing here.
[44:52.20]I dropped something.
[44:53.08]That's the core.
[44:53.76]Fuck, there's wine on it.
[44:56.24]I can't like get over there.
[44:57.24]Hold on.
[45:02.94]There's no way to get this reliably without causing a problem.
[45:07.64]There's three different problems here.
[45:09.58]There's like my ass in this camera.
[45:12.44]There's like fall over table.
[45:29.29]we're good okay okay why do you wear short shorts these are not short shorts they're regular shorts I'm just sitting down like a normal human they're just shorts and I'm sitting
[45:56.97]Sorry, I don't have like shorts that go down to my ankles.
[46:01.60]Bunch of fucking prankers.
[46:04.00]Pranking me all the time.
[46:05.08]Alright.
[46:06.88]That is what I need.
[46:13.28]So then I get to tear these off?
[46:15.38]These stickers are going to stop the console from slipping around.
[46:17.56]It doesn't matter if they're a little wonky.
[46:22.47]Oh, fuck.
[46:23.85]Put all these on here.
[46:25.48]There are eight spots to place the stickers and they're very, they're heavily numbered.
[46:28.98]Pay close attention to the markers as we place them.
[46:33.92]So just put, smoothing the piece out to make sure it's nice and flat will help the stickers sit properly, right?
[46:38.62]Well, you just maybe fold the whole fucking thing, so that's not gonna happen.
[46:47.41]First up are the smaller stickers.
[46:49.87]There's smaller ones
[46:55.45]Start with the spot.
[46:56.25]What do you mean?
[46:56.89]Oh, okay.
[46:57.31]Let me see.
[46:58.43]So I have to tear this off?
[46:59.75]Do I have to... Does it tear off nice?
[47:02.25]And clean?
[47:02.73]It does.
[47:03.09]Okay.
[47:04.78]Alright.
[47:05.92]So we just align these up.
[47:08.88]So it goes like that.
[47:13.20]Like this.
[47:13.64]Oh, I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up.
[47:19.56]So it goes like halfway on.
[47:20.93]Alright, here we go.
[47:21.91]Can't screw it up.
[47:22.43]I only got one.
[47:23.65]There are no extras in here.
[47:34.34]Looks like this.
[47:40.80]Right?
[47:44.49]Right?
[47:46.87]Yeah, that looks good.
[47:49.55]Yeah, no, that's perfectly fine.
[47:52.37]That's perfect.
[47:54.07]You couldn't ask for a better.
[47:56.87]But the sticky stuff on the edge of that though, okay, yeah, so you gotta fold it over.
[48:01.70]Fold over the sticky sides like that.
[48:03.47]I was going to say, that wouldn't make any sense.
[48:10.37]Yeah, they weren't kidding when they said this was going to take a while.
[48:16.05]Now it's going to do that with, I'm assuming, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[48:17.89]Let's just see.
[48:18.33]1, 2, 3, right?
[48:18.73]3 and 4 together here.
[48:20.94]Okay, so that's 1, 2, 3, 4.
[48:34.23]Let's just get this done nice and quick.
[48:37.15]Not too quick, though, because I don't want to ruin it.
[48:41.56]Somebody just gave community subs, like, an hour ago.
[48:45.86]Uh, Dr. Steen, thanks for the five community subs.
[48:52.82]20 minutes ago.
[48:54.44]It's hard for me to see.
[49:00.72]Oh, God.
[49:01.52]Good, does he know...
[49:04.45]Those are from last night?
[49:05.47]No, they're not.
[49:07.55]That's like 18 minutes ago.
[49:08.71]I've been streaming for like 30 minutes.
[49:17.02]I can't wait till you guys get to see this.
[49:18.38]We're gonna experience this together.
[49:21.12]It's gonna be so much fucking fun.
[49:22.66]I cannot wait.
[49:25.48]I didn't even sleep last night, because I knew how much fun this was gonna be.
[49:28.42]It's like Christmas.
[49:30.20]You're waiting for Santa.
[49:31.08]You're waiting for Santa.
[49:31.82]Santa's not here yet, but he will be in like six hours.
[49:38.04]I can't get this off.
[49:45.49]I can't get this one off.
[50:00.95]I probably look like some ugly right there.
[50:03.47]Alright, so I'm doing this right, right?
[50:05.19]So this goes here.
[50:05.91]Wait, but how does it fold over?
[50:08.72]It just doesn't?
[50:10.90]Huh?
[50:16.50]How is that supposed... Oh, holy shit, I almost just messed it up.
[50:20.38]I was going to put it over here.
[50:21.86]It's supposed to go, like, there.
[50:22.94]I almost just blew that.
[50:24.40]That would have been really bad.
[50:25.25]This.
[50:35.51]Nintendo Labo.
[50:39.93]So guys, I gotta tell you something.
[50:44.02]I went back to the dentist, right?
[50:45.94]I had another dentist appointment today.
[50:48.44]I was there earlier.
[50:50.06]And you have no fucking idea how fucked up this was.
[50:53.20]So I'm in the chair, right?
[50:54.18]I don't wanna mess this up.
[50:59.33]Where does this one go?
[51:01.85]No, it's not that.
[51:02.81]Put it over here.
[51:03.83]They both go side by side.
[51:08.49]Three, four.
[51:11.78]Okay, three.
[51:14.22]And let's get this other one, four.
[51:18.01]Then these pieces, these ones are bigger somehow.
[51:22.53]Oh, 15 turtles.
[51:29.83]Oh, come on.
[51:31.65]They make these things so hard to fucking remove.
[51:33.39]I think that looks good, right?
[51:42.05]Both these fold over.
[51:46.99]I hope.
[51:47.25]Alright, and then what do I do with the big ones?
[51:56.11]So these are longer and they go just across the whole thing.
[51:59.25]Alright.
[52:06.24]What are you saying, Seinfeld?
[52:08.56]What was the dentist's story?
[52:09.46]Oh, you can't believe it, so how about the chair?
[52:12.61]No, that's a joke, because I've had three dentist stories in the last two weeks.
[52:18.56]Tell the rest of the dentist story.
[52:22.36]So, how about the dentist?
[52:28.53]That's correct, right, yeah.
[52:30.05]Too longer than here and here?
[52:32.35]How the fuck did it open?
[52:32.97]I have no idea.
[52:36.87]And?
[52:37.67]No, there is no and.
[52:39.25]I've already told it.
[52:40.24]I told it two days ago.
[52:43.07]The joke is I have a third dentist story.
[52:45.99]But, you know, that's just the punchline.
[52:47.93]There is no punchline.
[52:49.21]Oh, here's another dentist story incoming.
[52:56.30]There is no punchline.
[52:57.34]I wasn't even making a joke.
[53:00.00]I was making a reference to me having problems with the dentist every day.
[53:08.50]I need closure.
[53:11.77]Why do you need closure on a non-existent story that didn't happen?
[53:18.85]Alright, speed it up.
[53:23.00]These go across here and then here.
[53:25.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:27.22]Yes.
[53:31.78]I've got bad teeth?
[53:34.12]What did you say?
[53:35.89]Have you seen these?
[53:39.68]I can bite, I can take a jolly rancher, guys, and go like this, and I can bite right through it.
[53:48.41]I was that guy in middle school and high school that had the fucking steel teeth.
[53:52.87]You guys remember now and laters?
[53:56.37]I used to just put them in and just start chewing and people would fucking gasp and freak out and like, my teeth are gonna get ripped out.
[54:00.51]Nope.
[54:14.28]We'll be done with the tedious part here in a second.
[54:17.78]That explains a lot, actually.
[54:21.68]Does it, though?
[54:22.22]What does that explain?
[54:23.28]I feel like that doesn't explain a whole lot.
[54:27.21]I feel like there's way more to that story.
[54:29.81]Where's the other one?
[54:33.95]I'm missing one.
[54:34.53]Where'd it go?
[54:38.39]Where's eight?
[54:43.18]Where did eight go?
[54:47.13]Check the table crease.
[55:05.48]No, where is it?
[55:09.00]One, two, three, four, five.
[55:19.60]Check the VOD.
[55:20.80]No.
[55:26.40]There's one more.
[55:26.99]What the fuck did I do with it?
[55:28.67]Jesus Christ.
[55:32.97]I bent it too.
[55:40.75]They look exactly the same.
[55:41.99]Give me a break.
[55:42.59]Alright, now I have to move this back because the table is now out of the view.
[55:48.90]need to go back here there we go now I'll get a little closer to you guys hey he doesn't know I don't know very much you're right see you have this you have this like periscope right now you can like see everything you can like zoom in and be like what's that stain I don't know this stain on my shirt I have no idea
[56:16.62]Did I eat like a hot dog with mustard on it earlier?
[56:18.88]Yes, I did.
[56:19.46]I don't know.
[56:20.20]I may have dropped something.
[56:21.20]I don't care.
[56:28.88]I don't know.
[56:29.24]Alright, so now these turn over and fold in.
[56:36.95]Alright, we can finally be done with this tedious sticker game.
[56:41.57]Like that.
[56:46.57]and then like this come on alright done finally that took a million years the whole thing's done fold it over so is a hot dog a sandwich um no I would call it a sub I mean a sub would is a sub sandwich sub sandwich right I guess it is a sandwich
[57:14.51]But a lot of people told you it's not a sandwich, that it's a hoagie or it's a grinder.
[57:18.97]It's not a sandwich, it's a hoagie.
[57:21.59]It's a grinder, right?
[57:23.95]Hot dog is not, well, hot dog is, it is.
[57:31.02]What happens here now?
[57:37.02]Well, I played Zelda VR.
[57:43.45]uh well this is not my switch so I don't uh my switch is dead like permanently dead unless I did something wrong which I know I didn't alright so this folds all the way over and it attaches together hold on like this I'm assuming the arrows line up and line up the markings and push it in firmly
[58:10.74]Once it slides in, like this, how the fuck does that go in?
[58:19.55]I guess like that.
[58:21.73]Are taco sandwiches?
[58:25.21]I mean, they could be.
[58:26.07]If you want to break it down by its very definition.
[58:30.91]Alright, that one's in.
[58:35.43]Alright, that's good.
[58:39.65]So that's done.
[58:42.63]Is everything lined up perfectly like this?
[58:44.51]Make sure your piece matches up.
[58:48.49]Yeah, I think so.
[58:50.03]Right?
[58:52.99]What do you guys think?
[58:53.51]Yeah.
[58:53.99]Yeah, it is.
[58:56.00]Flour, tortilla, flour, I mean, I don't know.
[58:58.78]I'm not going to get in a fight over this.
[59:03.78]Give the slot a check from the side, too.
[59:05.54]If it looks a little at all wonky, just straighten it up.
[59:12.88]I mean, it's a little wonky.
[59:15.13]A little bit.
[59:19.23]This looks like I'm about to put a hard drive in here.
[59:24.29]Here's my new keyless hard drive bay.
[59:28.52]Tool-less hard drive.
[59:30.14]Alright, this is wonky, but it'll do.
[59:31.58]Does it really matter?
[59:34.40]I got, guys, I got...
[59:37.36]I got a fucking Vive set up.
[59:39.66]Do you think I give a shit about this being wonky?
[59:42.06]By like 5%?
[59:43.66]I got a Vive right here.
[59:44.50]Alright, that's good.
[59:52.86]Stand it back up, and with that... How does this connect to here?
[60:00.48]Let's see if your console slot does its job.
[60:02.56]Now is also a good time to straighten your slot out if it's gotten crooked at all.
[60:09.46]So I have to slide that into here and make sure it fits.
[60:13.42]Ow.
[60:29.99]And it does.
[60:35.15]Nice.
[60:38.57]That fits pretty good.
[60:40.31]snug fits in there so it can come out nice and easy too that's a perfect fit nice let's stick that back in alright should come back on the screen here in a second alright let's go not on my screen though
[61:13.01]It's too loud.
[61:15.01]That's better.
[61:16.99]Alright, so that works.
[61:18.00]Now, where do I put this from here?
[61:34.45]This is just porn music.
[61:37.97]This is not porn music.
[61:40.03]What are you talking about?
[61:46.22]this is this is like arcade claw machine music this is not pornography music this is the song you hear playing over and over again inside of every Dave and busters you've ever been inside ever in your life but that's not true they play like they play the hits they play the hits I'm wrong I'm sorry alright we need b
[62:17.34]Yeah, what the fuck are you watching?
[62:18.88]What are you talking about?
[62:19.76]That's porn music.
[62:35.39]What does this one do?
[62:38.77]Dude, I'm starting to feel like a little drunk right now.
[62:40.37]Maybe I should like lick something that's a small cartridge related thing.
[62:44.07]Oh, that'd be like fucking funny.
[62:51.31]Alright, so let's go.
[62:53.37]What's this piece for?
[62:54.21]Your nose, of course.
[62:55.63]Leave the printed side facing up as you crease these foo.
[62:58.19]OK.
[62:58.61]Alright, crease this up like that.
[63:06.54]Any other pieces?
[63:12.76]I wish I had a nose.
[63:16.74]So this is going to slip on like this?
[63:19.18]I think my nose is too big for this.
[63:22.39]Yeah, I got like a schnoz, so I don't know if this is going to work.
[63:29.37]We'll see.
[63:30.11]We will find out very shortly.
[63:36.54]So that goes up like this.
[63:39.48]Okay, you want to see how disgusting of a human I really am?
[63:42.54]I just like put this on my nose for a second.
[63:48.77]Who is that...
[63:51.26]Who's that villain?
[63:54.22]There's a villain.
[63:55.24]There's a bad guy in like comic books that's always covered in like grease.
[63:59.85]What's his name?
[64:03.77]There's like a greasy villain.
[64:20.80]I don't know, the Silver Surfer?
[64:23.32]The Silver Surfer is like kind of just covered in oil, right?
[64:26.04]Yeah, I would be the Silver Surfer.
[64:32.97]He's fucking cool too, man.
[64:34.17]He like skis around and blows up planets, right?
[64:40.69]That's like his M.O., right?
[64:41.33]That's what he does?
[64:48.25]No, no, no, that's Iceman.
[64:50.65]What does the Silver Surfer do?
[64:56.51]What is the Silver Surfer... What's the difference between Silver Surfer and Iceman?
[65:01.56]They're the same.
[65:05.50]I don't... I can't... If you had, like, a crime lineup, and you told me to pick out the Silver Surfer, and you had Iceman, you had Flame Guy, and you had, like, Colossus, I don't know if I'd be able to pick him out.
[65:17.08]It would be hard.
[65:25.35]There you go.
[65:29.09]Iceman, I mean, what?
[65:30.23]He's like chrome.
[65:31.89]Yeah?
[65:33.76]What does he do?
[65:43.36]He's silver and he surfs.
[65:46.54]Isn't he a Fantastic Four villain?
[65:48.60]No wonder those movies have been so bad.
[65:54.50]What a cursed franchise.
[65:56.62]Wait, okay, what the hell is going on?
[65:58.14]It goes this way, and then you do it the other way.
[66:08.45]So this is that, and then that side?
[66:12.15]Yep.
[66:18.28]Fantastic Four.
[66:23.52]Okay, what is this?
[66:24.49]Let's get the smooths.
[66:25.59]No more stickers.
[66:26.39]I don't want to put more stickers on here.
[66:29.19]We only need one sticker for now.
[66:31.15]Thank God.
[66:33.33]Is this to determine where you are in the room?
[66:43.22]Wait, don't do this yet.
[66:45.98]First, fold the piece firmly in half like that.
[66:52.63]So that's that.
[66:54.92]This.
[66:57.02]Yes, they are lined up perfectly.
[67:00.00]This part needs to be neatly lined up.
[67:01.52]It's easy to get it wrong.
[67:02.44]Be careful.
[67:06.98]That's in there.
[67:07.82]That's perfect.
[67:10.64]Now using the star symbol as a guide, apply the first half of the sticker.
[67:16.58]Then it wraps around like an adhesive tape.
[67:22.36]Alright, I guess.
[67:25.34]Is that what this is for?
[67:26.30]To be adhesive tape?
[67:28.36]These are thin too.
[67:30.52]Oh boy, this is really thin.
[67:37.65]Make sure you guys can see.
[67:40.17]Fuck.
[67:42.59]Damn it, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[67:46.36]Got it.
[67:48.20]And then fold it over the other side.
[67:53.25]No air bubbles.
[67:54.65]Good.
[67:56.55]Yeah, so it is just like adhesive tape.
[68:01.37]Everybody calm down.
[68:04.57]Stream over, folks.
[68:05.37]Time to go home.
[68:06.13]What?
[68:06.27]Why are you going home?
[68:13.96]Don't go home.
[68:16.80]We got a whole bottle of wine here.
[68:18.86]Are you going to go home?
[68:20.56]No, you stay.
[68:24.36]Or go to a different channel that you enjoy.
[68:29.00]See you later.
[68:31.62]Don't leave me.
[68:32.56]Don't leave me here.
[68:36.00]If you leave, I'm just a guy folding cardboard drinking wine.
[68:39.24]You can't leave.
[68:41.81]Don't leave me here.
[68:44.13]I'm just like a sicko if you all leave.
[68:45.77]Alright, flip the piece over it's showing on screen and lift this part up, okay.
[68:55.71]Like, the second you guys all leave, I just become the weirdo.
[69:05.64]What'd you do on, uh, Saturday night?
[69:07.98]I just drank and played with a kid's cardboard toy for six hours.
[69:14.35]Oh, you didn't, like... You did?
[69:16.73]Yeah, yeah.
[69:17.59]Don't you have a girlfriend?
[69:21.59]Yeah.
[69:22.79]Where was she?
[69:23.21]I don't know.
[69:32.20]No, this can't be like that.
[69:35.08]Alright, so we're going to slide this into here.
[69:40.93]Like this.
[69:42.13]It's kind of an awkward way to do that.
[69:43.99]Like that.
[69:48.35]Looks good.
[69:51.53]Check the closet.
[69:52.37]No, I already did that before the stream started.
[69:53.87]She's not in there.
[69:55.73]Stand it straight.
[69:57.19]Time to stand the whole piece up nice and straight.
[69:59.03]That's the way.
[70:01.86]Okay, so it does stand on its own.
[70:06.00]I'm gonna get it straight like this.
[70:07.86]There you go.
[70:10.68]Okay.
[70:12.29]The nose piece is complete.
[70:13.87]So how does my nose go in here?
[70:15.83]Like this?
[70:16.39]This hurts.
[70:30.95]I'm just a rooster.
[70:35.92]I guess it's supposed to be like that.
[70:41.64]The bridge of my nose is so fucked up though, it's gonna be painful.
[70:43.76]Alright, fit the nose into the main lens frame.
[70:49.88]Open up the top and lay it out flat.
[70:51.60]Alright, we gotta do some surgery here.
[70:52.92]Excuse me.
[70:58.81]I don't want that to go down.
[71:00.99]So then this, how does this open?
[71:05.68]So this goes like this.
[71:06.84]So you pop it out here and then lay it out like that.
[71:14.96]Now move the nose piece into position, into position, into position, into position.
[71:22.79]Why was I saying that so weird?
[71:25.15]Like that.
[71:28.04]Oh, there's a little slot there.
[71:29.48]But now for this part, it'll be easiest if you hold the lens piece as shown.
[71:34.92]Yeah.
[71:36.16]Slide the red tab with the smooth sticker right into the slot between the lenses.
[71:43.33]Let's check on the other side too.
[71:44.51]Just look firmly inserted.
[71:45.75]So it just goes in here like that.
[71:49.05]So it goes like this.
[71:51.94]And that's it.
[71:55.92]It's in.
[71:56.94]That's in.
[72:00.79]No, it's not.
[72:01.39]Fuck.
[72:07.70]How do I keep it in there?
[72:13.92]Let's check the other side too.
[72:15.38]It's not firmly inserted.
[72:18.44]Show auto.
[72:22.12]No, no, I'm building a VR headset.
[72:24.26]No, we're not going to show auto.
[72:26.24]No auto.
[72:27.84]I'm not showing auto.
[72:31.78]Show auto, yeah, where are we gonna put him?
[72:33.82]Where's he gonna go?
[72:35.64]There's no room for him in here.
[72:38.50]No, I'm not showing, I'm not, alright, I'll show auto in like two hours, okay?
[72:45.20]So how does this go in?
[72:49.34]Let's add the console slot, so this is, it goes like this, and then spins this way.
[72:55.94]So like that.
[73:01.70]It's down here.
[73:03.74]This is ridiculous.
[73:04.96]How am I going to see this?
[73:08.45]Its two little feet should slide neatly into place in here.
[73:18.27]Is this the wrong way?
[73:19.07]Alright, its two little feet are in there now.
[73:26.26]In.
[73:34.77]Is it in?
[73:40.02]Okay, two little feet go in.
[73:42.72]And then now lift the middle flap and join it to this slot at the top of the nose piece.
[73:47.66]It might be tough, but push it all the way in.
[73:49.63]Okay.
[73:54.69]So is this even in there?
[73:57.63]So this...
[74:01.15]I can't even tell if it's even in.
[74:02.37]I think it is, alright.
[74:03.31]So then this piece comes up.
[74:04.58]I didn't even fold this fucking piece.
[74:05.96]I didn't fold this piece backwards.
[74:09.82]Why didn't somebody tell me I didn't do that?
[74:12.18]Nobody told me I didn't fold it.
[74:27.55]Is it in?
[74:31.67]Ooh, okay, now it's in.
[74:35.01]Is that good?
[74:37.41]Oh, fuck!
[74:39.09]No, goddammit.
[74:41.67]The whole thing came apart.
[74:42.69]I need a bunch of trained engineers to put this shit together with one hand.
[74:55.58]Get back in there.
[75:01.47]I end this.
[75:05.61]Feet go in there.
[75:06.40]Oh, you motherfucker.
[75:11.40]Oh, you god.
[75:14.64]Okay.
[75:19.50]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[75:20.73]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[75:23.87]It's in.
[75:24.29]It's in.
[75:25.09]Done.
[75:25.61]That's it.
[75:26.47]That's it.
[75:27.55]In.
[75:29.37]Hiya.
[75:32.72]Auto can fix it.
[75:33.60]Auto is not coming up here.
[75:36.64]Can you see the console slots and little feet poking out the side?
[75:50.49]Yes.
[75:52.65]Yes, I can.
[75:54.01]Yes.
[75:58.31]See?
[75:59.60]And on the other side.
[76:00.92]Yes, I can see the little thing popping up.
[76:07.30]Oh, and the bottom of the slot is still properly connected, right?
[76:10.01]Always best to make sure.
[76:10.97]Yeah, like, yeah?
[76:16.27]Yes?
[76:21.12]Great, then let's finish this thing up.
[76:22.48]First, roll the lens piece over onto its front.
[76:34.01]If it lines up perfectly with this fold here, the next part should be a piece of cake.
[76:44.06]It does.
[76:45.46]I would call that perfect if I were going to get a ruler out here.
[76:51.33]Lift up the great big top flap and tuck it under the plastic here like we did before.
[77:02.37]Okay.
[77:04.89]So then tuck that in like that.
[77:10.46]So that's in.
[77:14.06]And now secure the sides.
[77:16.28]So slide it down and tab it.
[77:19.73]Do the same thing on the other side, right?
[77:22.09]So like this.
[77:27.19]What happened here?
[77:34.52]Let's get in.
[77:39.20]Tab it.
[77:43.62]Alright.
[77:45.66]Same thing on this side.
[77:53.01]Slide it in.
[77:54.89]Get that tab in there.
[78:03.12]Beautiful!
[78:05.43]Accomplishments.
[78:07.59]We're making them.
[78:08.37]We're making them.
[78:09.39]Now, before we do that, make sure that the whole flap is still neatly tucked into place.
[78:13.29]It is.
[78:14.89]That's good to go.
[78:18.97]Close that other side.
[78:20.79]And are these corners tucked into place too?
[78:24.51]Yes.
[78:25.57]Yes, they are.
[78:28.84]Is this slot still a neat rectangle?
[78:34.84]Yeah.
[78:36.42]I think so.
[78:40.91]Now stand up, our goggles.
[78:42.49]Here's a little tip you want to remember.
[78:46.25]Why is there water on this?
[78:47.73]It's not, okay, I freaked out.
[78:54.76]Master hand.
[78:55.42]What is it?
[78:57.74]Do you see this symbol on the top right?
[79:01.08]Yes.
[79:02.06]Try giving it a little tap.
[79:20.19]Okay.
[79:20.91]Is this supposed to do something?
[79:28.73]I don't think that does anything.
[79:30.57]I think I'm just doing that for no reason.
[79:34.09]The VR goggles are complete.
[79:36.95]You guys are getting the fuck in there.
[79:38.97]Hope you know that.
[79:41.10]You're getting the fuck in here.
[79:44.46]You can experience VR for the first time.
[79:47.69]That's the bulk of the work done.
[79:48.79]Nice job.
[79:49.24]All I need to know is build on an important little accessory, which is what?
[79:54.72]Three to four.
[79:55.82]You mean three more pieces.
[79:56.78]Make the safety cap.
[79:57.98]Oh, great.
[79:59.48]Do I need this?
[80:00.12]What if I just don't build this?
[80:00.98]Who cares?
[80:01.34]Remove this one piece from A. What if I just don't give a shit about safety right here?
[80:22.84]Just that one?
[80:23.44]That's it?
[80:27.71]That's it, right?
[80:29.81]Punch this out.
[80:31.37]Safety cap.
[80:32.15]I wonder what this is for.
[80:34.89]I wonder.
[80:36.47]Okay, that's that.
[80:40.46]Punch this shit out.
[80:45.82]Punch this side.
[80:46.72]These are both out, right?
[80:48.64]Yep.
[80:51.25]Alright.
[80:52.17]Good, good, good, good, good.
[80:56.45]It's gonna be a hell of a vacuum job in here later.
[80:58.85]Alright, that's good.
[80:59.49]Move this out of the way.
[81:00.21]I don't think I need these anymore, but I'll put it here and definitely need this.
[81:04.04]Don't want to lose this one.
[81:08.80]I am stuffing my legs underneath this table right now.
[81:13.76]Because I have to put this all the way down.

[81:38.53]These are fantastic pants.
[81:40.14]They can do anything.
[81:40.94]They can go anywhere.
[81:42.18]You can wear these wherever the fuck you want.

[82:43.17]I'm gonna, like, burn some grass.
[82:45.57]Just, like, I'm gonna take one blade of grass and see what I can do.
[82:49.11]Don't do that at home.
[82:49.93]Don't do that because I said to do it.
[82:51.05]Alright, fold this.
[82:59.09]Do I have to start putting a disclaimer on every stream that says, don't listen to a word I say?
[83:07.44]Jerma lied about Ace Attorney.
[83:09.22]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[83:13.20]Jerma lied about Ace Attorney.
[83:14.56]That's 10 subs.
[83:15.24]Thank you so much for the 10 subs.
[83:17.08]I didn't lie about Ace Attorney.
[83:18.34]I told you the truth, actually.
[83:20.99]I told you the truth about Ace Attorney.
[83:25.19]How is that a lie?
[83:27.26]I said that's not a lie that oh my god somebody asked me about what happened to ace attorney and I very truthfully very transparently told them and everybody like three times ace attorney is not I don't even why am I explaining this a third time ace attorney is a series that I did not think I thought it was a different kind of game
[83:51.42]And I said I was going to play it off stream and see if I wanted to stream it and then we'll see.
[83:55.82]But I kind of hung it up a little bit though.
[83:58.44]It's not happening.
[84:01.00]That's not lying.
[84:01.70]That's me telling the truth.
[84:02.58]That's just the truth.
[84:04.22]That's me telling you a truthful statement.
[84:09.11]A lie would be, I'm going to play Ace Attorney tomorrow and I don't play Ace Attorney at all.
[84:12.85]And you say, where's Ace Attorney?
[84:14.27]And I go, I didn't say I was going to play Ace Attorney.
[84:18.01]That's a lie.

[84:30.45]I don't know.
[84:31.05]I don't know.
[84:31.37]I don't know what I'm doing.
[84:32.53]Guys, I don't know what I'm doing any day, okay?
[84:35.17]If you think I got a plan, I plan out very specific streams.
[84:39.68]But like drink wine and play Labo, kind of just happened like six days ago.
[84:44.52]It was like, oh yeah, let's just do that.
[84:45.82]We'll do that on like fucking Saturday.
[84:47.16]I don't even think I got a plan.
[84:51.05]the dunk tank is a plan that's gonna happen that takes a while day-to-day basis I don't even know what I'm eating for breakfast alright all these are done and then we're going to fold the whole thing up so like this like that connect this and this weird man this is weird

[86:06.26]Pointing and laughing at you this time.
[86:08.92]That's not what you said.
[86:11.08]Pointing and laughing at you this time.
[86:15.75]I don't know where that came from.
[86:17.21]This time.
[86:22.48]Alright, safety cap's done.
[86:23.54]Let's practice putting on the safety cap.
[86:27.40]So the safety cap just slides down on top of here.
[86:32.40]Like that.
[86:36.29]Alright.
[86:41.39]My mom has a shirt like that.
[86:46.70]Okay.
[86:54.68]What, anything else?
[86:56.34]Anything else I need to know?
[86:58.52]My mom has a shirt like, okay.
[87:11.44]It's a purple shirt.
[87:16.12]The whole website you're on right now is a purple t-shirt, okay?
[87:19.45]Don't think it.
[87:20.41]Don't be fooled.
[87:31.98]It looks great.
[87:32.62]Oh, this is purple.
[87:35.02]Take the safety cap off and put it over there for now.
[87:38.62]Okay.
[87:39.82]Looks good.
[87:42.95]When you're playing with the VR goggles alone, always make sure to put the safety cap on.
[87:48.55]Okay.
[87:49.51]Goggles and safety cap are ready.
[87:50.42]There's one more.
[87:50.82]What's the last piece here?
[87:54.06]We're going to add the console and the Joy-Con.
[87:56.88]Oh, this is where we're going to get to play.
[87:59.50]Oh my god, I'm fucking... I cannot wait.
[88:03.34]You won't be able to use TV mode for this part.
[88:05.28]Take the console out of the dock.
[88:06.64]Alright, hold on.
[88:08.79]This cannot be played in TV mode.
[88:11.77]Let me experience it first.
[88:19.60]Hold on.
[88:27.58]So I'm going to do it first and then you guys can do it after.
[88:30.16]This is going to be fucking awesome.
[88:35.07]How do you capture without the dock?
[88:36.37]I point it into the lens over there and I walk around with you guys.
[88:42.38]That's how.
[88:43.85]That's the only way.
[88:44.51]Alright, let me, hold on.
[88:46.35]I gotta put the screen on so I don't fucking embarrass myself somehow.
[89:12.94]Alright, so without further ado... Never mind.
[89:21.55]Alright, so then how does this work?
[89:25.23]So now... Make sure you have both Joy-Cons.
[89:30.50]Sorry, hold on.
[89:32.10]I'll get this back on here.
[89:33.28]Camera, BRB off.
[89:35.34]Okay, sorry.
[89:36.24]Just wanted to make sure nobody could say anything bad about me.
[89:38.86]Alright, so here...
[89:42.20]I have the left and the right controller.
[89:43.82]Let's turn the volume up so you can at least hear it.
[89:50.38]It's just a song, so who cares?
[89:52.64]Alright.
[89:53.76]I think I have to attach these.
[89:57.02]The time has come to remove the final seal.
[89:58.92]Done, done, done.
[90:01.74]Oh, I'm taking this off.
[90:06.34]Okay, go ahead, peel off the film.
[90:18.29]Yeah!
[90:21.85]Wow, whoa, that's weird, that's really weird.
[90:25.39]That's strange.
[90:29.01]I can't even describe what that looks like.
[90:30.69]Alright, that's off.
[90:36.63]I'll let you guys see it in a minute.
[90:39.40]It's my turn with the VR.
[90:42.20]Okay, let's fill in on how to hold the VR goggles while using them.
[90:51.81]Always grip them firmly with both hands like this, and of course, you'll want to make sure you're holding them the right way.
[90:56.80]Okay.
[91:01.76]Finally, let's practice looking through the VR goggles.
[91:03.96]I don't need to practice that.
[91:10.51]Okay, let's slip it in there.
[91:11.71]Let's try it, come on.
[91:15.13]And with that, we can finally say the VR goggles are ready to roll.
[91:18.01]Let's go.
[91:19.73]Whole new virtual world awaits.
[91:23.38]Alright, let's get it in there.
[91:33.28]I get to do it first.
[91:39.37]Okay, here we go.
[91:42.21]Wow, that's so cool.
[91:42.87]Alright, hold on, let me move this.
[91:51.11]I gotta pick something.
[91:51.95]Hold on.
[91:52.27]I gotta pick... This actually hurts my head.
[91:55.61]Alright.
[91:58.66]What do you guys think?
[92:01.44]Dinosaur Safari sounds fucking awesome to me.
[92:06.84]There's Mario Brothers, Mario Paint.
[92:09.81]I think Dinosaur Safari.
[92:12.35]Put on the safety...
[92:18.07]Alright, safety goggles are on.
[92:20.19]Dinosaur Adventure.
[92:24.57]Are you guys good?
[92:25.65]I'm gonna do it first.
[92:32.81]What the fuck, holy shit.
[92:35.49]What the fuck?
[92:37.51]That's a T-Rex!
[92:40.01]Oh my god!
[92:43.72]That's a doctor!
[92:44.82]Oh my, this is more realistic than Vive.
[92:49.02]Whoa!
[92:52.16]Oh my god, he's right here.
[92:54.10]He's literally right in front of me.
[92:58.73]Hey.

[93:17.41]Drive the car! Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!
[93:46.43]Holy fuck.
[93:50.65]Now there's a Stegosaurus.
[93:53.57]Stegosaurus and then the T-Rex.
[93:54.93]This is called Fight of the Century.
[93:56.75]Jesus.
[94:04.51]He's so huge.
[94:09.60]Who's that?
[94:15.48]It's hard to tell, I can't see.
[94:16.78]There we go, no, no, I was blurred out for a little bit.
[94:28.22]Alright, well that, I had to quit on it, I got disconnected.
[94:30.00]Oh, wait, what's this one?
[94:44.45]This is called Dino Adventure?
[94:49.65]They have like at least two or three dinosaur related games.
[94:52.21]This is so cool.
[94:54.18]There's a person here.
[94:57.06]Oh, I can see it.
[94:57.72]It's up there.
[94:58.44]That's a pterodactyl.
[95:15.73]Oh my god, the pterodactyl's huge!
[95:22.69]What was that?
[95:26.45]Oh, it's a triceratops!
[95:31.31]I didn't know they eat- I didn't know they eat plants!
[95:34.55]Holy fuck, that's amazing!
[95:37.21]I thought that they ate meat!
[95:38.15]You guys getting this?
[95:56.80]Watch the turtle.
[96:24.98]I'm not gonna put on, like, the turtles having sex.
[96:32.79]I mean, I was gonna fucking be in there and watch, like, the turtles having sex thing, but, like, come on.
[96:38.89]I'd like to keep my twitch.tv channel.
[96:46.58]Alright, so here's the real question, though.
[96:59.04]Don't make me, hold on.
[97:02.36]What is it, what's it called?
[97:04.37]What is it actually called?
[97:09.51]It's called like life time, life source or something, life scenes.
[97:16.15]What was the actual name of the television show?
[97:19.92]I'm not going to type into Google turtle sex.
[97:23.56]Are you out of your mind?
[97:38.38]Hold on this might be worth doing it I need to like be able to hear it In nature it's rare to form such a lifelong
[98:10.83]What's this called?
[98:11.93]This is called Nature.
[98:13.59]Oh, a nature documentary.
[98:20.46]All turtles.
[98:25.40]Oh, whoa.
[98:26.40]Is there a whale over there?
[98:38.07]Can you guys see the fishes?
[98:44.07]Their first breath together is the beginning of several hours of mating.
[98:50.02]Several hours?
[98:50.94]Well, I don't have to... He will hold on as tight as he can to keep her all to himself.
[99:00.40]Interesting.
[99:02.71]Unfortunately, they have company.
[99:05.09]Who's that?
[99:05.97]Another male.
[99:07.75]He will do anything he can to separate the pair and mate with the female himself.
[99:12.69]There he goes.
[99:14.13]He's behind the other guy.
[99:17.37]He targets the soft, vulnerable parts.
[99:28.70]He's punching him in the head.
[99:29.80]He's like punching him in the face over and over again.
[99:38.92]He knocks the air out of his rival.
[99:47.57]Wait, what?
[99:49.23]What's going on over here?
[99:51.67]The female is struggling now with the extra weight on her back.
[99:55.39]As soon as she will need to surface to take a breath.
[99:58.63]There's a turtle over here.
[100:00.79]There's two more turtles that way.
[100:04.89]Another male.
[100:08.41]He's over here.
[100:09.05]What's he doing?
[100:17.40]This is fucking crazy.
[100:19.80]What?
[100:20.74]There's like three!
[100:23.36]Whoa!
[100:24.30]Alright, I don't want to stop.
[100:28.75]I want to get out.
[100:29.79]I want to get back to Super Mario Bros.
[100:32.63]Out!
[100:33.45]I want to get out!
[100:34.27]I want to get out!
[100:35.57]Out!
[100:36.61]I don't want to see this anymore.
[100:38.40]This is like three that bite each other.
[100:39.92]They're like biting each other.
[101:07.24]Oh, we're done with that bit.
[101:08.48]It's over.
[101:11.82]He wasn't wearing the safety cap.
[101:13.84]I'm just imagining like if somebody was actually in VR and like just watching that.
[101:18.10]It's like, I say that.
[101:22.74]I say that.
[101:23.96]But aren't there like specific VR apps where you just like watch people?
[101:33.74]Like, oh, I'm just gonna sit here and just like stare at people.
[101:39.33]Dude, that's so weird.
[101:40.39]Like, I don't know.
[101:40.99]Like, I can't... VR porn.
[101:49.10]No, man.
[101:49.66]Like, that's too fucking much.
[101:51.74]I don't know.
[101:52.32]That's too weird for me.
[101:53.32]And I'll tell you a couple of reasons why.
[101:54.66]Listen to me.
[101:55.20]This is important.
[101:56.64]Story time.
[101:57.26]This is not a story.
[101:57.94]This is not like it really happened.
[101:59.02]But just listen.
[102:01.46]If you were...
[102:03.65]18 plus conversation coming up here.
[102:04.73]Okay, so if you're not like, if you're not over the age of fucking 18, then close, just get out of here.
[102:09.01]Leave.
[102:09.59]Just leave.
[102:10.52]Come back in like 20 minutes.
[102:13.40]If you have a VR helmet on your head, and you're going to watch pornography, and you're going to have the VR helmet, headphones, and your hands out here with like the controllers, and you're going to be like,
[102:30.66]You know, you'd better be alone in the fucking house.
[102:35.98]Better be.
[102:37.30]You better live alone, or you better be certain that your roommates or your parents are not going to come home.
[102:46.91]That scares the absolute shit out of me.
[102:48.93]I mean, I haven't done that in VR.
[102:52.17]Alright, we're gonna move on from that.
[102:56.97]That's too scary.
[102:59.22]What if, like, you're just sitting there enjoying adult material and you're lo- I've been locked in.
[103:06.05]I've had people come in this room and I didn't even know they were here.
[103:09.31]Imagine how fucking awful that would be and the embarrassment that would entail if you did not know somebody opened the door and there is no, like, Whoa, hey man, knock once!
[103:17.93]Knock for once in your life!
[103:18.95]No, no, no, no, no.
[103:19.61]You're just immersed.
[103:21.06]You don't even know that they're there.
[103:23.52]They could walk in and you're just... Whoa.
[103:27.54]Okay.
[103:30.19]No.
[103:31.17]I would never in a million years.
[103:33.23]In a million fucking years.
[103:36.69]Never.
[103:38.11]If you're going to do that, and you're going to enjoy adult material, and you're like an adult, you're an adult, before you start, just go peek outside and make sure there's no cars in the driveway.
[103:50.18]Please.
[103:51.28]For your own sake.
[104:00.02]I'm just saying.
[104:07.27]Anyways, let's see what's in here.
[104:12.41]I don't think I was supposed to put it in yet.
[104:17.19]And, I don't know, have like a security camera.
[104:21.89]Because, OK, if you're doing something in particular,
[104:29.44]That certain thing in particular, we're not gonna name anything, this could be anything.
[104:34.52]If you're in the headset, you're in VR, you're fucking sitting in your chair, I don't even know where the hell you'd be.
[104:40.69]You need to be able to get out quick.
[104:44.27]How do you... Why does that even exist?
[104:49.34]How is that even possible?
[104:54.50]You've got to have, if you're going to do that, not only check that there's no cars in the driveway, you've got to get a Nest Cam.
[105:00.26]And every, like, six minutes, like, have it pointed to the driveway.
[105:04.89]Like... Okay.
[105:10.67]Okay, nobody here.
[105:12.11]No.
[105:14.03]We can't lock your door either.
[105:15.51]Because if you lock your door, people are going to be like, what are they doing in there?
[105:22.05]You lock your door, it's even worse.
[105:32.87]Why did that... Bring it into the bathroom?
[105:43.33]Hey, what are you doing, man?
[105:45.17]You bringing your whole computer into the bathroom?
[105:48.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[105:51.35]But why is that?
[105:53.95]I didn't do my taxes yet.
[105:55.52]I gotta do my test.
[105:56.50]I'm gonna be in there for like two hours.
[105:58.92]Oh, you do your taxes in the bathroom.
[106:00.58]Yeah, yeah.
[106:01.40]I do my taxes in the bathroom.
[106:03.56]And I'm going to take a shower, too.
[106:04.84]I'm going to... I'm going to be in the shower, too.
[106:15.25]Jesus Christ.
[106:18.77]Look at this.
[106:24.66]I used to do that.
[106:26.04]Guys, okay, not just, no, no, no, no.
[106:29.94]Anytime I wanted to hide something I was doing in the bathroom, I would turn the shower on and turn on the, like, the water, too.
[106:38.03]For like, but no, no, no, listen, listen, listen.
[106:41.35]It was only for like, no, no, no, not wasting water, listen to me.
[106:47.21]I would turn it on so people thought I was going in the shower.
[106:51.62]But I was really, I was going to the bathroom.
[106:53.88]I was like, actually going to the bathroom.
[106:55.70]And people, I don't know, I don't know, you know, just start dating Kim.
[107:01.88]You know, you don't want Kim to know that you're in there going to the bathroom.
[107:05.16]I'm like, taking a shit.
[107:07.04]So like, oh, I'm just going to the shower.
[107:11.10]And then you would go to the bathroom as fast as you can, like in eight seconds, and then like turn the shower off.
[107:20.31]Oh, you guys got to see this.
[107:27.26]Let me do it first, for real.
[107:38.77]This works, weirdly enough.
[107:45.41]Line up the cursor and tap.
[107:46.95]I wish you could.
[107:47.41]You know, we're going to do this together.
[107:48.95]It's not fair.
[107:50.05]Come here.
[107:55.05]It's not fair.
[107:55.77]You guys should be able to do it too.
[108:15.08]May as well just put on something else.
[108:18.14]Okay, it's nothing you can't even see there's no way you'll see Alright, might as well just put on like I'm watching like a fucking TV show in here or something Alright, I'm gonna give you guys something to listen to while I play this for like two minutes
[108:48.41]Put on more turtles, not doing that again.
[109:05.86]There, there you go.
[109:31.49]You don't know what I'm doing in here.
[109:33.73]I'm in the bathroom.

[114:34.93]Look at how... There's so many games to play.
[114:38.61]Why can I not mirror this?
[114:41.49]How would you ever... Why would I ever do this on stream?
[115:00.23]We're going to build the blaster and we're going to talk about life.
[115:04.89]I don't know.
[115:05.29]There's so many things.
[115:15.76]I can't mirror this, though.
[115:16.96]Alright, we're going to do the blaster.
[115:20.66]Get back in there.
[115:34.57]Wait.
[115:40.16]Wait, wait.
[115:42.10]What if we just play them?
[115:43.84]Maybe I don't need to have them on VR?
[116:07.85]Whoa!
[116:10.53]No, this is a spoiler.
[116:11.41]This is a spoiler.
[116:12.05]I don't want to see this.

[118:48.72]What?
[118:50.56]What does that mean?
[118:55.12]I made a Taco Bell worker cry?
[118:58.71]When?

[119:13.77]Sweet dreams, girl.
[119:16.31]Um... I have no idea what you're talking about, and I don't remember making anybody cry.
[119:23.02]So, that might be a lie.

[119:33.68]How many times have you lied?
[119:35.52]To me.
[119:39.70]There's a lot here.
[119:42.28]Okay, the core is first.
[119:47.47]One of the five.
[119:48.59]Making the core.
[119:51.49]I'm a dummy thick.
[119:52.39]I don't know what that means.
[119:54.87]Alright, we need the bags over here.
[119:56.25]I got that.
[120:02.55]Alright, we need sheet A and these four pieces from A.

[120:41.51]For a second, I thought my mic was gone.
[120:42.73]I was like, what?
[120:46.20]I mean, we're gonna lick the cartridge.
[120:48.04]Nope, not gonna happen.
[120:52.30]Link back to this clip.
[120:53.28]Why?
[120:55.78]That's not a good idea.
[121:11.17]I've had like one and a half glasses of wine, guys.
[121:15.20]Come on.
[121:16.56]I'm not gonna get shit-faced.
[121:17.60]I'm just gonna fucking enjoy my wine and build my toy.
[121:24.82]This is a brandy wine.
[121:26.10]This is a bourbon wine.
[121:26.98]This is good stuff.
[121:29.52]Good old grocery store wine.
[121:32.43]Drink water.
[121:33.09]I've had plenty of water today and when I take my first break in like, I don't know, a little bit, I'm gonna have some water.
[121:41.38]I drink responsibly, guys.
[121:42.68]Come on.
[121:43.64]We joke around a lot, but I do.
[121:47.05]I drink water.
[121:48.21]I drink plenty of fluids.
[121:52.11]That's not going to be good.
[121:53.15]I really have to be careful about that.
[121:54.25]It's time to be serious.
[121:55.41]You're not a fucking comedian.
[121:56.58]Be serious.
[122:11.83]Alright, so this comes out.
[122:14.74]All the pieces, huh?
[122:16.00]So this is just recycling, right?
[122:19.32]Right in the recycling bin.
[122:20.26]Good.
[122:33.83]Go.
[122:34.25]What am I?
[122:35.51]I'm just like moving my hands around.
[122:40.54]Lick it, oh yeah, okay.
[122:43.80]I'll ban anybody that says that.
[122:47.84]For at least, I'm not kidding, six days.
[122:54.70]On the moon.
[122:56.18]Or on Mars, which is how long, I don't know, like fucking an hour?
[123:04.79]That's punched out.
[123:05.55]Let's punch this out.
[123:14.86]How you guys doing?
[123:15.36]You guys doing good?
[123:16.66]You guys having a good time?
[123:19.66]How's life?
[123:20.72]How's life treating you guys?
[123:23.91]I'm not going to lick it.
[123:24.85]Stop calling me a coward.
[123:28.85]Having a good time?
[123:29.45]Good.
[123:29.71]You having a good day?
[123:30.23]Hope you're having a fucking great day.
[123:34.29]This is going to take a long time.
[123:35.70]I'm already seeing how this is going to be a problem.
[123:38.42]No, it's not.
[123:39.14]I got plenty of wine.
[123:39.80]Alright, let's go.
[123:45.68]Don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back button.
[123:47.58]Uh-huh.
[123:48.36]Uh-huh.
[123:49.06]Yeah.
[123:49.98]Uh-huh.
[123:51.72]Are you ready to build the sleek Toy-Con blaster?
[123:54.02]First, we'll be putting together all the important inside parts.
[123:56.98]Grab this piece from the ones you just removed.
[123:58.77]It's got a controller mark on it.
[124:04.65]This one.
[124:07.41]This is the core, if you guys are curious.
[124:11.95]So then, yeah, you don't have to tell me every time.
[124:15.07]I know how to do this.
[124:16.58]Stop telling me how to do it.
[124:26.10]Not bad.
[124:28.66]Okay.
[124:34.09]So this folds up.
[124:36.09]Let's get creasing.
[124:36.67]We'll start with these two fold lines on the front side of the piece.
[124:38.97]Give the one close to you a good bopping.
[124:43.03]Yep.
[124:44.52]These two come up and flip it around.
[124:50.08]Well, those are hard.
[124:50.92]These are really, really tight.
[124:57.18]Not bad.
[124:58.99]Could be better.
[125:05.05]Did we get community subs?
[125:11.51]Trinart?
[125:14.09]Trinart just gave 10 community subs.
[125:16.65]10 community subs from Trinart.
[125:19.38]Thank you, Trinart.
[125:24.08]Look at his... Look at this dick hiding posture.
[125:30.40]No, it's called table hiding dick posture, okay?
[125:35.56]You guys need to relax.
[125:37.68]It's always gonna be about like a dick.
[125:44.63]Alright, got a lot of folds.
[125:48.63]So then, wait, this has to go back and around the other side, too?
[125:55.50]Wait, what?
[125:57.24]Why is mine not the same color?
[126:01.17]Oh, no.
[126:05.11]Oh.
[126:15.66]It's alright.
[126:19.22]The whole thing goes across.
[126:25.10]Is he okay?
[126:25.96]It's the same thing.
[126:27.06]I'm fine.
[126:28.42]Is he okay?
[126:29.60]I see that.
[126:30.16]Okay.
[126:30.66]Often when I look over at the chat, I'll look over at somebody and be like, yo, is he okay?
[126:36.42]Yeah, I'm doing great.
[126:38.28]Are you doing alright?
[126:39.02]Dude, is he alright?
[126:41.12]Is he okay?
[126:42.94]Yeah, I think.
[126:50.96]One time you almost puked on stream.
[126:53.06]I was worried.
[126:53.64]No, that was a fake puke.
[126:56.06]You're talking about this.
[127:01.81]That's what you're talking about.
[127:02.69]That's exactly what you're referring to.
[127:04.19]I know that because I did that like two weeks ago.
[127:08.83]I just wanted to make sure I could prove that, that that was not real.
[127:16.19]Hey, is he okay?
[127:23.18]Alright, I need to pay attention.
[127:24.12]Stop talking about my penis and puking.
[127:26.76]Do you have anything else to talk about?
[127:28.40]Leave me alone.
[127:42.26]This comes across like this.
[127:46.27]That's tricky.
[127:47.99]That's a really weird fold.
[127:52.37]But no, thank you so much to Trenok for the 10 community subs.
[127:56.39]Always appreciate it.
[127:57.11]Thank you so much.
[127:57.69]That's incredibly generous of you.
[128:02.97]And then fold, fold, fold.
[128:04.35]Just fold them all.
[128:05.08]I got it.
[128:05.78]I got it.
[128:09.28]The doorknob is shaking.
[128:13.40]What?
[128:17.92]You're going to be fine.
[128:18.60]Don't worry.
[128:21.86]Look, you got me here to protect you.
[128:24.10]Somebody burst through that door and they got the hands like this.
[128:27.28]Easy.
[128:30.31]He's out.
[128:31.11]He's done.
[128:33.15]That's it.
[128:33.83]He's done.
[128:40.79]Alright, let's go.
[128:43.80]Let's fold this one over.
[128:44.82]That one's done.
[128:45.70]Okay.
[128:47.46]And then the whole thing has to come over.
[128:49.04]Alright, like this.
[128:53.37]And then it comes up like that.
[128:54.97]And this comes up the whole thing.
[129:00.46]Yeah, the whole thing.
[129:03.04]Okay.
[129:08.10]And then this piece comes down like this into here like that, right?
[129:22.11]Did I do that right?
[129:22.71]Yeah, okay.
[129:23.11]And then flip the whole thing over.
[129:24.59]And then this comes up.
[129:31.93]So elaborate.
[129:35.57]Down and in.
[129:37.97]And this is the core.
[129:38.75]This is the core of gun piece.
[129:44.86]So that's in.
[129:45.76]That looks good.
[129:46.90]That looks perfect, right?
[129:50.94]The holder for the Joy-Con R is done.
[129:55.48]Work with this piece next.
[129:56.28]It'll be the blaster.
[129:57.12]Make satisfying sounds.
[130:00.46]Where'd you buy that?
[130:01.00]This one?
[130:04.63]Wear pants next time.
[130:06.43]You can't tell me what I can and cannot do.
[130:09.59]If I want to wear bike shorts... No, I don't think I can do that.
[130:14.81]Yeah, I guess you can.
[130:20.93]Lots of creases everywhere, the whole thing, right?
[130:27.49]Stop flexing.
[130:28.25]I'm not flexing on camera.
[130:29.47]I did it once for a LOL moment.
[130:33.29]Okay, it's literally every single crease.
[130:35.97]Start at the top here.
[130:42.51]Damn.
[130:50.56]People are laughing.
[130:52.34]I don't know why, but they are.
[131:03.04]Laughing.
[131:03.64]Oh, there you go.
[131:04.31]There's like ha-ha number 40.
[131:07.75]Not very many more to get to 100.
[131:09.73]Come on, guys.
[131:11.49]We can do it.
[131:12.45]If we put our power together, we can do it, right?
[131:23.75]Grab your little tab.
[131:26.23]Looks good.
[131:26.91]Got them all.
[131:27.35]Okay.
[131:30.93]Put all that boop into good use and start building.
[131:34.01]Fold the piece up.
[131:34.67]Long, thin box.
[131:35.91]So this comes up like this.
[131:40.08]And I'm assuming it wraps all the way around.
[131:42.66]Yeah.
[131:43.78]Yeah.
[131:45.36]Comes across.
[131:45.96]And this probably goes down into here.
[131:50.70]Damn it.
[131:53.13]It's tight.
[132:01.31]fold this in, and then that piece of it slides over.
[132:06.68]Okay!
[132:08.64]Next part, it just makes a little cylinder.
[132:10.48]Okay.
[132:12.68]That's easy enough.
[132:14.94]There.
[132:16.26]There you go.
[132:20.56]Now where does that go?
[132:24.26]Just get a job at a box factory and stream it.
[132:27.60]That's not the same.
[132:31.49]I keep pulling the table further and further in here.
[132:33.97]And it's going to be out.
[132:36.83]A box.
[132:37.41]What does that mean?
[132:38.81]Box factory.
[132:43.25]Two fold lines crease both the lines.
[132:45.77]And then it's going to come.
[132:47.01]Okay.
[132:50.95]One.
[132:52.75]Two.
[132:53.19]Alright.
[132:56.97]And this goes like that.
[133:02.15]The tabs on each end of the cookie will fit nicely into the slots.
[133:06.29]Fold the cookie up like so.
[133:09.73]Fold the cookie.
[133:14.34]Alright, so this goes in like that.
[133:17.06]It's the same on both sides, right?
[133:21.54]Stick it in, both tabs in.
[133:28.93]That's it on that side.
[133:30.45]Clicked.
[133:32.34]Beautiful.
[133:33.36]Jeremy, give us your end game review.

[139:26.10]Do the printed markings on yours match the one on screen?
[139:31.61]Yes.
[139:36.83]So put it down.
[139:37.57]Ooh, that's a satisfying fit, is it?

[140:03.48]God, I wish I was in there.
[140:06.89]Ta-da, this bit's done now, but there's still a long, long way to go.
[140:10.55]We haven't even finished step one.
[140:18.05]This is all we've gotten done.
[140:26.57]We made like a spore car with feet.

[142:47.26]What is this piece gonna be?
[142:49.87]What am I building?
[142:50.57]This is going to be a gigantic rocket launcher, and it started with this.
[142:55.77]This is the piece you start with, and this turns into an actual blaster cannon.
[143:05.90]So that's cool.
[143:06.86]I'm looking forward to how we're gonna turn this into that.
[143:09.98]Step by step, right?
[143:14.92]So we've got this piece starting here.
[143:16.42]Increasing all these fold lines with the printed side up.
[143:22.66]Check the screen closely.
[143:24.00]Don't screw it up.
[143:26.24]OK, Dad.
[143:28.80]So every single line is coming up this way.
[143:32.26]Every single one.
[143:38.65]I won't mess it up.
[143:39.25]Don't worry.
[143:46.56]50 minutes until auto.
[143:48.22]Why are you counting for that?
[143:52.50]It's when I go on break.
[143:53.72]You want auto waiting room.
[144:12.07]You'll get it.
[144:13.27]Why?
[144:13.55]He's just going to come in here and look at the camera for a second and then leave.
[144:18.25]He's probably in bed with Kim right now.
[144:20.93]He's probably sleeping.
[144:22.07]So I can't do that.
[144:23.33]No.
[144:23.61]No auto.
[144:24.31]Auto no.
[144:25.53]Not getting auto.
[144:27.37]No.
[144:28.73]He's probably just like lying down with Kim.
[144:33.93]No.
[144:34.25]Sorry guys.
[144:34.81]No auto.
[144:39.08]That's just the way it's gonna be.
[144:39.96]I don't make the rules, I just follow them.
[144:45.12]I mean, I make the rules, actually.
[144:47.93]And then I follow the rules that I put in place for me to follow them, so that's a rule I made a long time ago, that if Otto was asleep, I'm not gonna wake him to get him on stream, he doesn't wanna be on camera.
[144:58.41]He's a fragile boy, he doesn't wanna be on camera.
[145:17.11]What the fuck?
[145:21.71]How do I delete somebody else's message?
[145:23.93]Alright, that looks good.
[145:34.46]Folded.
[145:39.66]Oh, somebody just gave bits.
[145:41.68]Trinot gave 1,334 bits.
[145:52.28]Pinwheel kills Jerma in Endgame.
[145:58.66]Thanks.
[145:59.86]Thanks for the 13 bucks.
[146:07.43]Cheers to that.
[146:12.97]More of this dumb shit.
[146:15.97]I'm just going to hire somebody to do this for me.
[146:19.84]I'm gonna pay somebody $50 an hour to do this part.
[146:27.37]Alright, if you like stickers, then I've got good news for you.
[146:31.71]We'll need eight of these.
[146:32.81]50, wow, 50?
[146:41.15]Eight of these?
[146:42.94]I can't even count that high.
[146:47.31]Fuck, this sucks.
[146:48.27]This is where it takes... Hey, you know the four hours to build it?
[146:51.50]This is where it comes from.
[146:52.20]It comes from this tedious shit.
[146:58.86]So that goes over here on the actual crease, too.
[147:04.81]I'm putting them on the creases.
[147:13.21]Wait till you guys see this shit that I'm capable of.
[147:21.47]I fucked it up.
[147:22.35]But out of context, that sounds really stupid.
[147:26.51]I forgot that it's not even in the room right now.
[147:32.19]Wait till you see what I can do.
[147:34.85]Just wait till you guys see what I'm capable of.
[147:36.77]I forgot, in my brain, I have knowledge here that you don't have.
[147:43.83]And you won't have it for about, maybe like another 30 minutes.
[147:47.85]Wait till you fucking see what I'm capable of.
[147:56.83]Come on.
[147:59.09]Come on.
[148:03.47]Okay, it's a little crooked, but it's okay.
[148:08.77]Actual anime character.
[148:10.07]You have no idea.
[148:15.37]Ever since I was a kid, people underestimated me.
[148:27.56]Alright.
[148:29.04]What?
[148:29.38]I don't need this one?
[148:33.74]Oh, God damn it.
[148:34.62]What?
[148:35.00]I thought it said I needed eight stickers.
[148:37.90]God, they underestimated me.
[148:44.20]What?
[148:44.76]It said I needed eight.
[148:48.56]What the fuck, man?
[148:49.66]Really?
[148:53.04]We got big bits?
[149:01.04]$15 from Spoons for self-defense.
[149:02.54]Thank you.
[149:05.84]I can't read from that far away.
[149:06.96]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[149:08.56]Jerma, can you pretend to be Elmo Thanos for the rest of the stream?
[149:29.11]Reality is often... Mr. Noodle!
[149:33.47]Reality is often disappointing, Mr. Noodle.
[149:39.89]That's all you get.
[149:45.13]That's how you do that, boys.
[149:53.55]Clip it.
[150:05.88]Flip it.
[150:07.70]So this rolls back.
[150:08.80]That's weird how that rolls back.
[150:10.06]Do it again.
[150:10.42]Do it again.
[150:12.02]So this goes like this, and then this... Back, like... Back, bending its spine backwards, but I didn't even fold this one.
[150:21.25]How are you supposed to do that?
[150:24.23]Ah!
[150:35.41]I'm sorry.
[150:41.57]So now what?
[150:46.55]Like this?
[150:47.95]What a psycho.
[150:51.57]What a psycho.
[150:58.29]Check the bits.
[150:58.93]I see them.
[151:00.11]Wait, what?
[151:01.85]Did actual big bits come in?
[151:07.81]Why would you start crying?
[151:08.91]Alright.
[151:11.10]Right here.
[151:20.34]Right in the middle.
[151:22.22]Two slots in the big slot.
[151:23.76]Let's see if I can get it in.
[151:31.93]Got it.
[151:34.71]Got it.
[151:38.24]Big bits.
[151:38.66]Oh, I'm getting, oh, look, I'm getting jaded.
[151:42.44]Wow, what a surprise.
[151:46.98]Like that.
[151:52.23]Okay, then flip it over like this.
[151:54.81]Get the slot sticking out here.
[151:56.53]Can you guys see?
[151:57.45]Is this a good camera angle?
[151:58.45]Do you want me to change it?
[151:59.40]You want me to go in deeper?
[152:01.34]How's it look?
[152:05.90]Is it good?
[152:06.28]You need the camera like over here?
[152:08.52]Brighter?
[152:10.86]It's good?
[152:11.24]Yes!
[152:13.87]Okay.
[152:17.49]Yes, they are in the right spot.
[152:21.79]So these two little sticks here.
[152:26.20]He's doing this again.
[152:33.80]Welcome to the stream.
[152:34.62]How are you?
[152:36.72]Good to see you again.
[152:37.30]Hope you're having a good day.

[153:06.24]Top five in Twitch?
[153:07.94]Nice.
[153:09.60]Yeah, I don't know what to say, that's a lot.
[153:13.16]That means a lot, thank you, for the huge people there.
[153:15.95]Alright, flip both sisters over and fold them in half.
[153:28.05]What Labo, this is the VR Labo.
[153:30.89]The virtual reality Labo.
[153:33.82]Take one sister and line her up just like on screen.
[153:36.24]She'll slide in here to keep the tabs in place.
[153:40.44]This right, right here.
[153:43.62]That, let's stick that in.
[153:46.42]Feels nice and snug.
[153:49.82]I see big bits.
[153:51.84]A lot of money, a lot, like too much money.
[153:54.44]Alright, so hold on.
[153:56.76]Juno Upsetto gave $50, 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[154:03.34]Thank you, Juno Upsetto, and they say, imagine not donating real big bits, BWL.
[154:15.39]Well, imagine giving anything at all.
[154:19.08]That's remarkable to me, so thank you.
[154:21.56]Thank you for the 5,000 bits and the $50.
[154:24.74]Freudian Weapon gave $50 as well right after that.
[154:31.90]Your vocal range never ceases to impress me.
[154:35.86]Also, when it comes to wine, what is your recommendation?

[154:51.41]Thank you.
[154:52.97]Thank you for the $50 donation.
[154:59.86]You do have a nice elbow.
[155:00.88]Hey, I do have a nice elbow, don't I?
[155:06.32]How do you take bits back?
[155:10.75]You can't.
[155:22.82]No refunds.
[155:24.80]Zero refunds.
[155:27.05]I got range.
[155:28.71]Absolutely no refunds.
[155:30.97]Zero refunds.
[155:32.55]Okay, I gotta stop that because that's like mean and annoying.
[155:50.20]Yeah, orc.
[155:51.04]Alright, these all fold up and around.
[155:53.46]I'm assuming these tabs sticks through, right?
[156:01.97]Yep.
[156:04.11]Look at how this is turning out to be something really, really weird.
[156:06.87]Look at this.
[156:10.50]That's weird, huh?
[156:12.20]That's wild.
[156:12.98]That's weird, weird stuff.
[156:14.22]Weird, wild stuff.
[156:15.86]OK.
[156:18.06]This goes down.
[156:18.56]This goes down.
[156:19.26]OK.
[156:19.32]So then what?
[156:33.90]slips in so this is kind of needs to be bent a little more because this goes in here like that and then these tabs come out and go in like this that right am I doing that right oh this is going to be
[157:05.55]Oh, okay.
[157:05.95]So what is it?
[157:06.73]Tab?
[157:07.05]Oh, I fucked it up.
[157:07.95]I didn't stick that tab in.
[157:19.10]I'm so angry right now.
[157:21.22]You can't even begin to understand my rage.
[157:26.89]What's the point of even having the tabs on here?
[157:30.13]I don't get it.
[157:32.37]Maybe one day I will.
[157:35.67]He's mad because bad.
[157:38.71]Say it again.
[157:40.25]Mad because bad.
[157:41.27]Mad because bad.
[157:44.23]And then this part flips over this way.
[157:47.55]This tab goes down and the koala bear comes forth.
[157:51.63]No shit.
[157:53.51]Alright, so then this comes over here.
[158:00.24]This goes up like that.
[158:05.09]And through here, like this, the controller mark should be up.
[158:14.03]It is.
[158:15.37]And then just slide all the way in.
[158:21.23]Ready?
[158:21.49]Insert the holder as far as it will go.
[158:23.27]Oh, shit.
[158:33.04]No, no, it's tearing.
[158:39.86]That's in.
[158:42.16]That's in!
[158:47.52]Look at that.
[158:48.00]Look at all these pieces coming together.
[158:50.00]This is gonna be a rocket launcher eventually.
[158:53.38]Eat the lab bow?
[158:54.02]What if I just fucking started tearing the thing apart?
[158:57.88]What a waste.
[159:01.26]And these ears fold in and this thing, the whole thing goes down.
[159:06.26]here's fold in and this whole thing goes down here like that holy that's cool nice you'll want to do an important check here if you pull on the end of the holder does it move a little bit without coming free it does should that not be happening
[159:36.56]What the fuck?
[159:38.55]No!
[159:43.79]Kind of, right?
[159:47.25]No, it is.
[159:51.37]Here we go, just a gentle tug.
[159:52.79]Don't tug too hard or the holder might pull free.
[159:56.97]Why is it doing that?
[160:06.60]I mean, it's not even in there secure.
[160:11.67]Look at how gently I'm doing this, guys.
[160:22.27]That's alright.
[160:23.84]It's fine.
[160:29.24]Put the stopper into the little gap you can see around the bottom of the holder.
[160:32.14]It's going to go on the L mark, okay?
[160:35.84]So I'm going to do some folds here.
[160:39.52]Fold in half, and then fold this one over, and the tab.
[160:45.12]Beautiful.
[160:45.50]The whole thing folds in half.
[160:51.29]Get this little guy here.
[160:52.11]Doesn't have opposable thumbs.
[160:56.17]Yes, I do.
[160:58.53]I'm a human.
[161:00.96]Ah, I see.
[161:01.64]This keeps it in place here.
[161:10.98]Wait, what?
[161:14.25]So this... This is the right way, right?
[161:24.75]All the way?
[161:26.47]All the way.
[161:26.93]That's in there.
[161:37.46]That's in there correctly, and the other side too, right?
[161:39.54]Oh, this folds down and into the little tab.
[161:44.68]This thing is intricate for being... Looks pretty good.
[161:54.54]Did I get black box for this?
[161:55.68]I did not.
[161:56.46]I've got Copper and Thief.
[162:02.26]It's a different red blend.
[162:03.08]It's still a red blend.
[162:08.94]I don't know.
[162:09.36]It's the first thing I saw at the grocery store.
[162:10.60]Whatever.
[162:12.84]Same thing on the other side.
[162:13.72]Yeah.
[162:15.58]Here comes a spill joke.
[162:16.85]No, I can't do that here.
[162:20.85]Can't do that.
[162:22.09]Don't even make that a joke.
[162:24.19]Because that can't be a reality.
[162:27.01]Sorry, guys.
[162:27.89]No funny jokes to spill.
[162:29.23]Like, oh, it went everywhere.
[162:30.71]He got wine all over his room?
[162:34.21]Nope.
[162:35.47]Mm-mm.
[162:36.21]No.
[162:39.16]Sorry, no.
[162:41.43]Can't do that.
[162:45.85]VR wine spill, please.
[162:50.27]Why do you want that that bad?
[162:56.11]That's in, and then close it up.
[163:03.13]Ruin toy.
[163:04.47]No, I'm not gonna, why would I do that?
[163:05.95]These things are expensive.
[163:10.49]So there you go.
[163:11.43]Starting the cannon here.
[163:12.73]This is like the guts.
[163:15.69]What am I making?
[163:16.57]It's a gigantic rocket launcher.
[163:18.39]It's a big blaster.
[163:20.58]Almost like a big TF2 rocket launcher.
[163:22.32]It looks really cool.
[163:22.90]Alright, so that's done.
[163:30.59]Can I do an American accent?
[163:39.99]I'm not going to respond to that.
[163:41.83]Alright, so this is C. So it's this piece here?
[163:50.77]Yeah.
[163:56.83]He said TF2.
[163:57.63]Never mind.
[163:58.35]Alright, that's the one piece we need to finish the core of the rocket launcher.
[164:07.05]My legs are so tired right now because they're being bent like this because I have to do it to make sure like the crotch cam isn't complete in total view every second.
[164:17.08]Alright, let me punch these up.
[164:35.51]Put the plastic bag back.
[164:36.81]I don't have any plastic bags right here.
[164:39.63]So this, these, this actually stays in here.
[164:41.49]I don't want to take that out.
[164:44.09]I don't care anymore.
[164:44.79]Fuck it.
[164:45.09]Who gives a shit?
[164:46.72]You can make your little jokes.
[164:47.96]You can make your jokes.
[164:48.78]That's fine.
[164:51.90]Alright.
[164:54.56]You'll need a sheet of smooth stickers.
[164:56.80]Okay, I got the smooth stickers.
[164:57.77]I got one here.
[165:01.73]Auto is streaming TF2 right now.
[165:05.12]Wow.
[165:06.22]He's a dog.
[165:07.18]That's kind of impossible, but it's cool.
[165:08.36]Alright, so we need two on those.
[165:12.33]I got one here already.
[165:14.31]Wrap it around.
[165:17.31]Alright, so wrap this around.
[165:26.34]And then around here.
[165:29.44]Cool.
[165:30.38]Thank God I was able to use this one for something.
[165:33.74]Same thing on the other side.
[165:48.02]Grand Theft Auto.
[165:49.70]Little Otto.
[165:53.16]He's so cute.
[165:55.10]He's my special little boy.
[165:58.16]He's my little son.
[166:01.72]Same thing on the other side.
[166:02.68]I did it.
[166:06.72]He actually has to go into the vet.
[166:07.74]He needs to get a shot.
[166:09.65]Okay.
[166:15.09]More stickers on this side.
[166:16.39]Two more, right?
[166:17.77]So this is long ways.
[166:18.67]Don't let me mess this up.
[166:19.73]I will.
[166:20.51]I will screw this up.
[166:23.95]So instead of this way, we go this way.
[166:26.54]And then fold it over, okay?
[166:29.96]So across the whole thing.
[166:43.03]Come on, I need to prove why I'm the number one Nintendo Labo streamer.
[166:50.88]Looks good.
[166:51.68]Same thing.
[166:56.46]This is going to use another sticker to cover the last.
[166:58.88]The sticker will overlap a bit with the one next to it.
[167:01.43]That's fine.
[167:02.13]Good thing I read that.
[167:03.23]I would have been freaking out about that.
[167:08.93]He's the only one.
[167:13.67]Oh, come on, where's my recognition from Nintendo?
[167:20.74]Where's my award?
[167:27.00]Where's my award?
[167:32.89]I am responsible for at least three sales of the Nintendo Labo.
[167:38.77]My mother watched the stream and she bought one.
[167:41.28]One of the mods bought one.
[167:42.58]They thought it was cool.
[167:44.44]I think one or two other people bought one.
[167:46.82]I'm responsible for three or four sales.
[167:48.78]Where's my award?
[167:50.06]Where's my red carpet event?
[167:52.22]Alright, now these all have to fold.
[168:06.61]Even with the tabs on?
[168:07.63]Okay.
[168:12.65]It's gonna be hard with the tape.
[168:14.80]Jesus, I feel like it's gonna break.
[168:20.30]This guy lied about Otto.
[168:22.38]I did not lie about Otto.
[168:23.68]Otto is just fine.
[168:26.04]I'll see him some other time.
[168:29.78]He's doing just fine.
[168:37.04]I still have 24 minutes.
[168:38.16]I got plenty of time.
[168:40.96]I got plenty of time.
[168:43.57]time time is a curious thing sorry it's power never mind even the little ones and the little frayed ones alright but let me ask you this right so like uh you know I'm an influencer you know
[169:12.71]I'm a dot-com millennial influencer.
[169:17.52]How many of you guys, be honest with me here, what am I doing?
[169:21.52]What the fuck are you doing, dumb stupid idiot?
[169:23.56]No one should listen to a goddamn thing I ever say.
[169:26.18]So I'm an influencer.
[169:27.40]I tell you things and you listen to me.
[169:32.55]Has anybody bought a Labo because they've watched it on stream?
[169:46.09]That's a lot of no's.
[169:49.29]But what if I ever... Okay, so if somebody comes up to... Hey, man, we want to sponsor your channel.
[169:54.25]Any analytics you can give us?
[169:56.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[169:57.80]I'm Mr. Nintendo Labo.
[170:00.46]I haven't sold any copies.
[170:01.78]I sold three copies of the Nintendo Labo.
[170:04.78]Really?
[170:05.12]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[170:06.22]Like four.
[170:08.14]Oh, okay.
[170:09.10]How many viewers do you have?
[170:09.96]I don't know, like 4,000.
[170:15.76]We'll call you back.
[170:16.78]We'll call you back, man.
[170:20.07]Thanks.
[170:20.55]Thanks for calling.
[170:21.13]Okay, bye.
[170:23.97]Alright, what's next?
[170:29.35]I bought wine.
[170:30.79]I sell more bottles of wine than I do the video game.
[170:34.17]Alright, rubber band small.
[170:41.32]We need one of the smaller ones.
[170:45.95]Uh-oh, viewers are dropping fast.
[170:49.07]It's alright.
[170:51.96]Having a lot of viewers is cool.
[170:54.88]But it's alright.
[170:55.74]You know, it's not about the viewers.
[170:57.26]It's not about how many viewers you have.
[170:59.48]It's about how many units you can push at Nintendo Labo and then tell somebody that comes to you at, like, a Twitch party how many units you sold and then maybe they'll give you, like, 30 grand to do it again.
[171:08.37]That's, you know, that's what matters.
[171:14.47]So this goes in here.
[171:20.40]All the way?
[171:20.92]Will that fit in there?
[171:25.46]Got a box of wine, cooking wine sponsorship.
[171:28.12]No, no one ever sponsored me.
[171:29.52]It just doesn't happen.
[171:30.17]No one ever sponsored me.
[171:30.99]I'm too much of a rebel.
[171:34.63]Is the rubber band sampling the notches?
[171:35.83]It should look, yeah, it is.
[171:38.05]It is, right?
[171:38.45]Yeah.
[171:39.25]That's in there.
[171:50.71]Uh it's time to attach the piece to the rest of the core.
[171:54.00]I'm no serious like I'll be real. I'm one of those people that will accept like- I've never had but-
[171:58.00]If I accept a sponsorship, let's say it's for like a certain drink for like a wine company or something.
[172:02.00]Oh you should get sponsored by a wine company, oh that'd be funny.
[172:04.00]But I'm the type of fucking asshole like weirdo where if- I will take a sip of it and go: Oh that's gross.
[172:10.00]And just be kidding around and then they'll cut the contract in half. so I did- it's never gonna happen.
[172:18.68]I turned the core piece over so it'll make sure both pieces are facing the same direction.
[172:21.60]Okay.
[172:26.05]Like this?
[172:27.17]No, like this.
[172:31.79]Did somebody say same?
[172:33.07]Yeah, same.
[172:37.07]Oh, they said save.
[172:38.91]Okay.
[172:41.47]Why am I holding the Joy-Con?
[172:43.85]Because I have to fast forward.
[172:49.17]This is intricate.
[172:50.01]I have to go forward.
[172:54.30]That goes all the way in here.
[172:56.56]Like this.
[173:02.48]Like that?
[173:04.88]Like a little ship, kind of?
[173:08.58]Lift the cover piece up and slide it on.
[173:11.13]Check that you work to make sure everything lines up like it should.
[173:13.41]I mean, that's not snapping into place, though.
[173:18.05]That's kind of just sitting here.
[173:18.99]Is it supposed to just sit there?
[173:25.48]This doesn't feel like it's on.
[173:26.76]This is not right.
[173:27.80]Why is this just flopping around?
[173:32.72]Maybe it's just supposed to be like that, I guess.
[173:34.48]And then the sides go in.
[173:49.90]Flip it around like that.
[173:51.52]I'm going to put the brightness up a little bit.
[173:53.16]You guys can't see.
[173:53.74]I'm going to put the brightness up.
[174:15.36]That's better.
[174:17.26]It's getting a little darker.
[174:19.04]Better?
[174:21.77]You guys can actually see better, right?
[174:31.80]Actually, yeah.
[174:32.78]Just make it a little bit brighter so you can see what's going on.
[174:36.30]Alright, so what's next?
[174:38.54]The rubber band now has to come up.
[174:43.06]Remove your makeup.
[174:43.90]I don't got any makeup.
[174:45.80]Alright, now that's it.
[174:48.00]Make sure the rubber band doesn't...
[174:49.95]Hasn't come out from under the tabs, no?
[174:51.84]It's still there.
[174:53.06]Still in there.
[174:54.94]Right?
[174:58.48]That's it.
[174:58.88]There's the core.
[174:59.49]The whole core is done.
[175:00.25]Why does this feel frame-ready on the other camera?
[175:03.51]What is up with this bullshit?
[175:06.03]This is frame-ready.
[175:06.83]For what?
[175:28.13]Better?
[175:28.49]That's better.
[175:29.30]Worse?
[175:47.73]That's better.
[175:50.09]Is it washed out?
[176:08.76]How bright is this?
[176:09.68]Is this as bright as it can go?
[176:11.39]Hold on, watch out.
[176:17.23]That's bright, right?
[176:21.61]That looks good, I think.
[176:22.79]That's good.
[176:26.57]You got to see my knee.
[176:28.64]Oh heavens to Betsy, we saw his knee.
[176:38.56]Alright, now this can go in here.
[176:43.30]We're getting the scan lines, though.
[176:44.70]What the fuck?
[176:45.70]Cameras suck.
[176:51.72]Alright, that's going to have to do.
[177:00.56]One last check.
[177:00.98]Let's try inserting the Joy-Con that's the one with the plus button.
[177:03.40]Yeah, I know what it is.
[177:05.44]So this goes in here like that.
[177:09.35]like that so that goes in and this is going to be a little like right something like that right why did somebody give me a -2 I just made a sound it doesn't well I'm not making a joke everything doesn't be a joke
[177:39.35]I can't get it out now.
[177:48.48]What does it say in the instructions about not being able to remove it from the thing?
[177:56.46]I actually, I really can't get this out.
[178:06.07]No, what the fuck?
[178:07.97]Come on.
[178:14.41]I can't get it out.
[178:16.59]It's in there for good.
[178:23.07]Cut it out.
[178:23.57]I'm not going to cut it out.
[178:24.55]I don't know why it's in there so tight.
[178:29.53]They usually don't come out like this.
[178:31.09]It's not this hard to get them out.
[178:32.75]This is so deeply in there.
[178:34.61]It's unbelievable.
[178:37.49]You can hear that, right?
[178:40.10]That shouldn't be doing that.
[178:52.77]I seriously don't get it.
[178:53.49]I don't know what it's stuck on.
[178:59.19]Jesus.
[179:01.09]Don't break it.
[179:01.73]Alright, that's it.
[179:02.93]That's it.
[179:03.25]I did it.
[179:06.24]There's a tab on the bottom.
[179:11.50]I like that.
[179:11.94]There, there, there, there!
[179:24.15]Reference to the Taco Bell thing, you said that you got a big order and it was completely wrong.
[179:28.01]You complained and the managers broke down crying.
[179:36.12]What the hell are you talking about?
[179:41.02]This didn't happen.
[179:42.60]This is, you made this up.
[179:46.14]What are you, what?
[179:51.18]They got my order wrong
[179:52.98]And I complained and the manager cried.
[179:56.20]That is a made-up story.
[179:57.58]This did not happen.
[180:03.06]That was my cousin.
[180:05.42]Well, you can tell your cousin.
[180:06.38]I'm sorry to hear that, but it wasn't me.
[180:07.52]Alright, now I'm making the actual rocket launch tube.
[180:10.62]I can probably move this core out of the way.
[180:13.40]Let's do a wine check here.
[180:18.56]I didn't do anything.
[180:19.36]This is D. D is right here.
[180:29.98]throw it you guys want yeah so so I don't know what it is with the Twitch audience right but like oh yeah break it like out of the glass break the wine no one in Twitch chat ever says hey read a book hey dude like relax and breathe deeply because everyone wants you to break something they want you to smash up your house
[181:00.40]So we need both pieces.
[181:15.00]Drink some water.
[181:16.22]I'll be good, don't worry.
[181:17.62]I'm taking my first break in like, now.
[181:20.90]In like, right now.
[181:23.13]Soon.
[181:33.66]What did you do?
[181:36.21]Tority just gave 20 community subs.
[181:40.77]20.
[181:40.79]20 community subs from Tority.
[181:43.21]That's a lot.
[181:45.47]Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[181:51.80]That's a fucking shitload of subs.
[181:53.06]Thank you for the incredibly generous contribution.
[181:58.14]Thank you.
[182:09.50]Alright.
[182:12.72]Someone give me a sub and I'll high five myself.
[182:17.36]What do you mean stop?
[182:18.74]It's cardboard.
[182:22.18]Stop, dude.
[182:22.96]Be careful with that.
[182:25.04]It's like a quarter of an ounce.
[182:33.10]You might get, oh, hey, wait, dude, be careful.
[182:34.64]You might get wind in your face.
[182:35.84]You might get like some wind in your face.
[182:38.28]Are you prepared for that?
[182:39.56]Is he okay?
[182:40.12]Is he okay?
[182:47.52]Oops.
[182:50.95]You okay, man?
[182:51.49]You've never been better.
[182:58.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[182:59.39]Don't fold these until you know what you have to do.
[183:02.13]Don't be an idiot.
[183:02.87]Don't be an imbecile.
[183:06.21]Okay, so these tabs... So we're going to start with this one.
[183:09.91]Facing this way.
[183:10.39]So these tabs pull out and all the way back.
[183:14.12]Kind of weird how they do that, though.
[183:20.60]This camera does look like you guys have chlorine eyes.
[183:23.01]I hate it.
[183:36.33]That's a lot of money.
[183:37.45]Hold on.
[183:39.39]100 bucks.
[183:41.71]10,000 bits from Magellan 36.
[183:47.11]$100.
[183:47.13]100.
[183:51.80]They say, hey man, this is the last money to my name.
[183:54.72]I'll be moving back in with my parents starting next week.
[183:57.58]I've been up and down the road looking for re-employment, but my name's now been tarnished beyond repair.
[184:04.45]Taco Bell was my one true go at life and you've ruined it more than you could ever know.
[184:10.69]Thanks, asshole.
[184:12.11]Signed, you know fucking who.
[184:28.70]Next time somebody asks for extra Diablo sauce,
[184:36.55]Put it in the bag.
[184:45.15]Or there'll be a complaint that is issued to the manager on duty.
[184:52.78]Just want to be clear about that.
[184:54.66]I'm not trying to be mean or anything.
[184:55.92]I'm just trying to be completely real about it.
[185:05.32]You're scary.
[185:09.20]Ow!
[185:09.34]Alright.
[185:12.06]What am I doing here?
[185:16.69]Flip it like that with the tabs bent.
[185:20.73]Why are you linking a clip that says auto in two hours?
[185:22.99]He's like sleeping.
[185:24.01]I'm not going to get auto.
[185:43.66]Thank you.
[186:17.07]Thank you.
[186:50.45]Thank you.
[187:23.83]Thank you.
[187:57.23]Thank you.
[188:46.85]Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present something I worked on a long time.
[188:56.30]Something that nobody thought I could ever do.
[188:59.47]Something that people thought was impossible for me to do on my own.
[189:16.50]I made all of King's fucking landing!
[189:24.15]Oh yeah, these are all individually crafted pieces.
[189:29.43]That's the red cape.
[189:31.57]Take a look.
[189:32.99]This took like 17 hours to make.
[189:35.07]This is an incredible piece.
[189:42.94]What happened to the tower?
[189:44.68]What happened?
[189:50.36]Uh, what happened to the other tower?
[189:52.65]There's another, there's one here and there's one there.
[189:54.39]It's not there.
[189:58.29]Oh, a kid's gonna kill me.
[190:15.37]Where did it go?
[190:48.03]Hey!
[190:57.31]Where's Otto?
[190:57.93]I didn't go get, I went to go get King's Landing.
[191:01.51]Alright, what, where are we?
[191:05.72]Switch as you go, yeah, my Switch is going to sleep.
[191:12.06]We're doing just fine.
[191:13.62]How many hours in are we?
[191:16.05]It's been three and a half hours, holy fuck.
[191:17.93]That's a long time.
[191:20.79]What have you been up to this whole time?
[191:22.59]Alright, now I'm gonna slow down.
[191:28.99]I don't wanna drink that much.
[191:29.85]I don't wanna drink that much.
[191:31.87]Let's be responsible.
[191:35.70]Okay.
[191:37.90]Otto is in bed.
[191:38.78]He is not going to be awoken to be exploited in front of Twitch chat.
[191:48.80]But I do have to do this, though.
[191:51.32]Because, fucking goddammit, pants motherfucker.
[192:14.71]I can't wear belts, they make me wanna puke.
[192:18.56]Alright, hold on.
[192:27.07]Belts just like feel like someone's like squeezing my hips.
[192:29.63]I don't like it.
[192:30.23]I got arthritis in my spine.
[192:31.69]I can't wear them.
[192:40.32]Alright, why does it still look like this?
[192:50.11]There we go, that's much better.
[192:52.96]Jesus.
[193:01.14]Alright, finally.
[193:03.18]Finally!
[193:03.68]Alright, what are we doing next?
[193:07.52]Auto plus King's Landing.
[193:10.32]It's not gonna fall on me.
[193:13.72]Let's go.
[193:15.60]Time to fold.
[193:22.03]You guys can ride all you want.
[193:23.33]I'm not going to go wake my dog up and put him in front of a camera.
[193:27.10]That would be a bad pet owner.
[193:29.40]He's to be relaxed and hanging out and doing what he wants to do.
[193:33.08]I'm not going to force him to do something.
[193:34.36]I'm not going to just pick him up and stuff him in a camera.
[193:37.17]Pick him up and stuff him in the camera?
[193:39.63]No.
[193:41.05]Not going to happen.
[193:42.25]Uh-uh.
[193:43.37]Sorry.
[193:46.51]Good owner.
[193:47.23]No, I'm not going to.
[193:47.81]Why would I do that?
[193:50.25]He's just relaxing.
[193:51.19]Why would I want to just go disrupt his day?
[193:55.43]He's just being a dog somewhere, you know?
[193:59.44]No, get up and I want you to come out for content.
[194:02.50]Get over here, quick.
[194:04.12]No, he's fine.
[194:07.14]Just look up a picture of, just type in Otto Jerma and you'll get a good picture.
[194:12.34]You know what he looks like.
[194:13.06]Same thing with the other one, right?
[194:14.87]I'm submitting.
[194:19.28]Fold the whole thing in half, maybe?
[194:26.79]Looks like this is coming across.
[194:31.55]And then all the way around, that goes into there, like that.
[194:44.35]Go get Midas.
[194:46.05]I'm not going to take my roommate's dog out of his room to show on camera.
[194:52.58]You guys have lost your minds.
[194:58.26]Alright, there it is.
[195:02.36]Arrow's pointing the right way.
[195:05.14]Take a moment to check that none of the teeth have gotten folded.
[195:09.41]It doesn't look like it, right?
[195:10.99]The teeth look like they're straight up.
[195:16.54]Now we're gonna work with this pot.
[195:19.04]What are we doing with this pot?
[195:22.42]Already got it in the right spot.
[195:23.66]And though I don't, spin it.
[195:24.62]I'm gonna smash this whole desk.
[195:30.44]I almost just did.
[195:35.72]No dog on stream.
[195:36.94]We need a dog.
[195:40.44]You don't need a dog, you're fine.
[195:42.81]Listen, you don't need a dog.
[195:43.79]You don't know what, responsibility-wise, it's really hard work.
[195:47.50]You gotta feed it.
[195:48.74]You gotta take it outside.
[195:49.88]You have to take care of it.
[195:51.76]You don't know what it's worth.
[195:53.16]You don't know what it's like.
[196:04.41]Minus 100 bits.
[196:05.59]That actually looks kind of funny.
[196:08.17]Alright, uh, crease, crease, crease, crease.
[196:15.67]Crazy Ball?
[196:19.26]Am I a dog?
[196:20.94]No.
[196:23.08]I would have been like a bee or something in a past life.
[196:27.56]I would have been like a honey bee.
[196:29.06]Or like an ant.
[196:35.98]Dude, in my past life, I was definitely like a cheetah.
[196:38.32]No, you weren't.
[196:38.74]You were probably like a bug.
[196:42.26]Statistically speaking, you were a bug.
[196:46.62]I think in my past life I was probably a cat or a wolf.
[196:50.21]No, no, you were a beetle.
[196:54.95]Or one of the five trillion different ant colonies in the world.
[196:57.70]Let's just be realistic about it, right?
[197:03.32]Alright, this closes, I'm assuming, right?
[197:12.38]I mean, it's not cool to think about that.
[197:14.22]It's really cool to be a jaguar.
[197:17.26]You weren't a jaguar in your past life, unless you hit the lottery.
[197:20.01]Alright, there we go.
[197:25.63]This folds into here.
[197:27.91]So this goes up like that.
[197:33.43]Make sure they're facing the right direction.
[197:34.84]Pay careful attention to these semicircles.
[197:40.69]The semi... Okay, so yeah, I got it the right way.
[197:43.15]Right?
[197:43.47]Yeah?
[197:44.13]That's correct?
[197:48.67]So, face it this way and then stick it through here.
[197:52.24]I'm assuming through here.
[197:53.08]Let me see if I'm right.
[197:55.12]No, I'm not.
[197:56.52]Right through the middle.
[197:59.26]Weirdly enough, this just goes in the middle like this.
[198:14.04]All the way?
[198:14.50]Insert the hexagon into the opening like this.
[198:17.64]It might be a tight fit.
[198:24.33]I mean, it's not even going in.
[198:28.61]It's not going in.
[198:29.13]What do I do?
[198:29.53]I don't know.
[198:29.91]I don't know what to do.
[198:30.43]It's not going in.
[198:30.87]What do I do?
[198:31.21]Alright.
[198:38.03]Seriously, man.
[198:38.67]Like, just get in there.
[198:46.47]I mean, it's kind of in there.
[198:48.03]Kind of?
[198:48.59]Not really, though.
[198:49.23]It's like all fucked up.
[198:50.93]Is that what it's supposed to look like?
[198:56.46]No, it goes all the way in.
[198:58.40]What?! !
[199:21.90]the way huh into the teeth I did it it's I mean it's there it's all the way through oh oh that's not good that really isn't good am I going to actually break a labo for the first time I'm supposed to be a labo streamer
[199:52.01]No, it's okay.
[199:54.71]Not great, but not okay.
[199:56.57]It's okay.
[199:59.43]Alright, close it up.
[200:03.46]That and then this comes across and in.
[200:14.08]Close it.
[200:15.64]Close it.
[200:16.94]Close it.
[200:18.34]Same thing on this side.
[200:20.73]This is the first part of the canon.
[200:24.60]Dude, I'm going to display this.
[200:27.68]This is going right next to King's Landing.
[200:29.20]Unless you didn't think I was capable of doing that.
[200:33.35]Sponsored Labo streamer.
[200:34.85]Nope.
[200:36.87]Nintendo's going to sponsor this channel.
[200:40.37]Drinking alcohol on stream.
[200:43.09]They wouldn't want this.
[200:43.87]They wouldn't allow that.
[200:44.64]That would be a huge problem.
[200:55.52]That's good.
[200:55.90]I think that's the whole thing, right?
[201:01.79]And then the tab goes down and sticks in the corner here.
[201:05.51]It's a little notch there.
[201:09.71]It's in there now.
[201:10.57]Okay.
[201:15.03]It's in.
[201:15.37]Now what?
[201:19.59]The last thing to do for this piece is to tuck the flap.
[201:21.54]The little tooth should slot right into the opening.
[201:24.00]Okay.
[201:25.85]There's not even any music.
[201:33.03]What did I do?
[201:34.01]He already did?
[201:34.55]I missed big bits?
[201:41.65]Where?
[201:44.74]There's no big bits, what are you talking about?
[201:48.90]Jerma stocks are soaring.
[201:56.02]I'd get in if I were you.
[201:57.75]Alright, remove these three sheets.
[201:59.57]C and E. I heard analysts were talking about this stream in particular was going to be the most booming streams of 2019 and 2020.
[202:13.60]There's a twitch.tv analyst told me that.
[202:17.70]Well, it didn't tell me that.
[202:18.48]I saw it.
[202:20.72]E and C. So this huge piece is coming out.
[202:25.26]Let's see.
[202:25.98]Let's see if one of these old ones here.
[202:29.72]This one here.
[202:36.16]Insider Trading.
[202:37.96]An analyst told me that.
[202:39.10]They said, new stream is pretty cool.
[202:40.90]I was like, nice.
[202:43.95]Thanks for that, man.
[202:53.46]Such a hidden gem.
[202:57.40]And then you wake up tomorrow when it's fucking down 85%.
[203:00.08]You were like, but you drank on stream and talked a bunch of shit about Nintendo.
[203:10.99]Talked about how unsponsorable he is.
[203:15.55]And bad of a streamer he is.
[203:20.30]Oh, fuck.
[203:22.58]Oh, no.
[203:24.32]How did I not see this coming?
[203:30.50]And then I, like, make my way over to the bank.
[203:34.50]And take out the fucking ATM deposit.
[203:36.14]You know what I'm saying?
[203:39.82]This is dumb.
[203:44.20]What'd I lose?
[203:51.44]Okay.
[204:00.44]That popped up big.
[204:07.39]You're actually in a huge downward trend right now in your stocks.
[204:12.75]I just took a week off though.
[204:13.95]Does that matter?
[204:17.36]It doesn't matter.
[204:18.14]Whatever.
[204:18.96]Downward stocks.
[204:20.04]Twitch stocks.
[204:21.94]Who cares?
[204:22.60]Twitch stocks.
[204:26.86]Your stocks are down.
[204:33.72]I mean, are they though?
[204:34.66]Because I put a call option out on Tesla a few weeks ago.
[204:43.50]Sure about that?
[205:01.65]Stop flexing.
[205:03.73]I did not do that.
[205:06.24]I'm just pretending to.
[205:14.64]Call options on Tesla, LOL.
[205:24.05]You say that now, but if you had done that a week ago... We're talking stocks here.
[205:30.15]I know what I know about stocks.
[205:39.47]Investment advice from Twitch chat.
[205:42.61]Didn't somebody have a Twitch account where Twitch chat told them what to buy for stocks and all that?
[205:47.27]That's so funny.
[205:50.17]That's such a fun idea.
[205:57.80]So we got this.
[206:04.16]Sounds like an easy way to lose money.
[206:07.06]I don't know how well or how bad that channel's account did.
[206:10.31]I know that he was doing it.
[206:12.11]Somebody was doing it.
[206:14.09]It's a really fun idea.
[206:15.69]Really cool piece of content.
[206:18.57]Alright, so what we got?
[206:20.89]Punched it all out.
[206:23.02]Okay, I need a big space.
[206:27.70]Auto, Labo is a ResidentSleeper.
[206:40.64]Every Labo that comes out I have to do.
[206:43.06]I signed a contract with myself.
[206:48.48]No one else was involved.
[206:56.34]Number one Labo streamer.
[206:58.64]I fucking hear it in my sleep.
[207:01.62]So this has to be like this.
[207:04.76]Alright, I gotta get this out of the way.
[207:11.74]Jerma is his own demon.
[207:14.72]Lick the cartridge?
[207:16.02]Oh man, that sounds kind of fun.
[207:17.38]I've had a few drinks, man, that sounds like a fun idea.
[207:20.42]Maybe I'll do it.
[207:23.55]He's not gonna do it.
[207:26.03]Just fold this tab out.
[207:31.77]Do it, do it, link.
[207:33.97]What do you mean link?
[207:38.37]Tab up.
[207:46.25]This one.
[208:05.11]This one.
[208:07.01]This one.
[208:09.21]How many more?
[208:10.11]And this one too?
[208:10.93]So many creases and folds and doodads and doodles and... QRSTUV.
[208:27.36]There's two fold lines here.
[208:29.86]Is there?
[208:30.20]No, there's not.
[208:31.62]Oh, there is, shit.
[208:33.60]QRSTUV.
[208:39.17]What a fucking disaster.
[208:44.97]You know, I woke up the next day and I was so embarrassed.
[208:46.81]I was like, what the fuck happened?
[208:48.61]I knew what happened, but I'm never going to live that one down.
[208:53.05]It's impossible.
[208:58.20]I need this back here.
[209:06.01]top five streams if you say so so this one goes across between the holes down here right yeah two holes I think I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I hope it's right it's kind of a weird place for a sticker
[209:34.32]to five streams to top five.
[209:37.04]I missed it.
[209:38.04]Somebody said the top five streams.
[209:44.46]That was the wrong place?
[209:45.46]No, it wasn't.
[209:47.60]No, that's correct.
[209:52.09]Is it?
[209:53.43]Yeah.
[209:53.87]No, it is.
[209:55.35]That's right.
[209:57.81]So only one?
[210:04.59]I just got her and you're already drunk.
[210:06.43]I'm not, but thanks for asking.
[210:10.38]Okay, uh... Firmly with both hands.
[210:13.26]Alright, the whole thing has to come up in half.
[210:16.76]Somebody said Kappa?
[210:18.98]You never see Kappa anymore.
[210:22.19]Oh, this is a tough one.
[210:26.63]Kappa really fell out of favor, didn't it?
[210:29.39]People now do, like, Omega LOL.
[210:36.49]People don't do it anymore.
[210:37.35]100,000 bits?
[210:43.42]Damn, thanks man.
[210:44.94]That's a lot.
[210:51.68]That folds the crease there.
[210:54.94]And then here.
[210:58.52]Omega B-double-D-well.
[211:00.07]B-double-D-well.
[211:01.99]Jeremiah, how do I get into voice acting?
[211:04.61]Really simple.
[211:06.91]Learn how to say W. That's it.
[211:11.42]W. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[211:12.50]Excuse me.
[211:13.34]Sir or ma'am.
[211:13.96]Excuse me.
[211:15.48]W. W. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[211:19.76]Try it again.
[211:21.67]W. W, W, W. W, W, W. Try it.
[211:25.81]Come on.
[211:37.73]That's good.
[211:43.29]You did that W-W joke a long time ago.
[211:46.54]No, I did W-W.
[211:49.44]W is W. It's three syllables.
[211:52.58]In the VA voice acting world.
[211:56.01]That was drunk.
[211:57.63]God damn it.
[211:58.95]That was like drunk.
[212:00.41]Just rewind that and listen to that.
[212:09.89]That's like Dr. Steve Bruhl.
[212:12.03]There's that in the voice acting world.
[212:19.69]Got him.
[212:23.53]I'm just gonna do them all?
[212:24.91]Just do them all, right?
[212:28.96]That one is gonna be hard.
[212:30.88]Okay, do them all, crease them all.
[212:34.36]This is like a thick piece of fucking paper.
[212:39.95]Your Steve Bruhl is just John Wayne.
[212:44.57]Is it?
[212:48.46]WWW.
[212:50.46]It's me, John Wayne.
[212:52.46]No, it's not.
[212:53.86]John Wayne talk like this.
[212:55.62]That's not, what are you talking about?
[213:00.70]John Wayne.
[213:02.02]John Wayne.
[213:02.88]No, I can't do a John Wayne.
[213:04.86]I tried.
[213:14.45]Alright, so let's keep going.
[213:19.42]Baelgrim.
[213:22.54]John Wayne's an interesting impression, because if you can't do John Wayne, you just sound awful trying to do John Wayne.
[213:28.40]And if you can do John Wayne, you sound great.
[213:30.90]There's really no in-between.
[213:32.72]You sound terrible and really bad and not good at all if you try to do it.
[213:38.17]If you can do it, you sound great.
[213:43.63]What's the worst possible voice you can do, like most grating?
[213:46.55]I don't know, I don't think I have anything like that.
[213:53.06]I gotta get this last one.
[214:07.76]I mean, maybe like air coming out of a horn, maybe like an air horn.
[214:11.79]that is barely running out of air.
[214:14.53]Might be close.
[214:24.60]That's as close as I can probably get.
[214:31.78]Something like that, probably.
[214:39.54]Oh, Kim is sleeping.
[214:44.71]Okay, no more of that.
[214:50.56]Oh, shit.
[214:57.18]Alright, I'm being quiet.
[214:58.20]This is, look at how hard this one is.
[215:03.29]Look at this.
[215:04.13]Do you understand how fucking impossible this one is?
[215:08.61]Look at this shit.
[215:09.65]How are you supposed to do this?
[215:26.78]That wine's not going to spill.
[215:28.64]I got a good eye on it.
[215:35.76]God damn.
[215:36.90]Alright, that's all of them, right?
[215:39.24]One, two, three, four.
[215:40.58]Yep.
[215:41.34]So this is going to be the blaster portion, right?
[215:46.68]Take care of these triangle teeth.
[215:50.17]Huh?
[215:52.75]Fold them up.
[215:55.51]So tiny.
[215:59.67]Can we get a sweat check?
[216:00.51]Yeah.
[216:02.13]What's that?
[216:02.93]Oh, we're good.
[216:04.07]We are completely clean.
[216:06.59]Didn't expect that, did you?
[216:12.87]You did not expect that.
[216:13.91]Neither did I. Alright, now this is...
[216:29.92]So this piece goes over here.
[216:35.08]Where the hell does this go?
[216:39.33]Many important bits come together to make a space station after all.
[216:43.31]This is a gun.
[216:46.05]Flip it over.
[216:49.03]Fold it all up, every little crease.
[216:51.46]Okay, I got it.
[216:54.60]We got bits.
[217:00.63]What are you talking about?
[217:08.50]Close that.
[217:13.42]He got you again.
[217:14.94]Well, it's really easy to get you.
[217:17.53]It's not that difficult to get you.
[217:21.15]He's hungry for bits.
[217:22.67]Wait, bits?
[217:23.07]You said bits?
[217:25.83]How many?
[217:26.15]How many?
[217:29.76]This wine's actually not that bad.
[217:31.52]I didn't like it at first.
[217:32.26]It was too fruity.
[217:34.80]It was like really sweet and sugary, but it's growing on me a little bit.
[217:39.00]This is Cooper.
[217:44.86]Cooper and Thief.
[217:46.92]For those of you that want to pretend this is a sponsored stream, go ahead and pretend.
[217:55.82]I did all that.
[217:57.24]Oh, shit.
[218:05.58]We need an eyelet.
[218:09.08]We need one of these.
[218:12.60]And one of the washers.
[218:17.74]Washer and eye.
[218:19.48]Something that's going to go through there.
[218:22.00]Oh, shit.
[218:28.51]You see the tracks go this way.
[218:31.47]And then... Oh, shit.
[218:47.52]that and then this on top of that like this snap that piece on where did it go sit in there kind of alright snap in like that step three
[219:17.46]is fold the whole thing over weird okay so this what is this for oh must be an ammo box of course I have no idea what that is how do you skip forward to its completion well it's pretty easy you go to bed so go to sleep right now when you wake up in the morning come back to Jerma 95 twitch.tv
[219:43.61]and open this content and skip forward like four and a half hours from right now.
[219:49.78]You just have to go to sleep and then just wake up.
[219:52.12]You'll be able to get it.
[219:56.60]That's the only way.
[220:00.95]Minus 120,000 bits for being a poopoo head.
[220:05.97]Okay, thanks.
[220:06.65]Alright, that was fast.
[220:08.89]Now it's time for this piece.
[220:13.99]Why does this fit my face so perfectly?
[220:19.16]This was made for my chin and face to go in here.
[220:24.64]Is my chin really that skinny?
[220:36.08]What?
[220:36.34]Wow.
[220:40.73]Oh well.
[220:46.26]So let's fold everything from this side up.
[220:52.93]Fold these tabs back.
[220:53.93]This one too.
[221:01.49]Someone measure it.
[221:02.51]Measure my chin?
[221:05.71]What is that gonna do?
[221:08.11]Here come all the fold lines, do it all.
[221:09.79]Okay, this one and that one.
[221:15.60]I have a compact chin.
[221:16.60]I kind of have a big chin.
[221:18.48]It's skinny, but it's long.
[221:23.98]I've got a long, skinny chin.
[221:25.74]It's alright, though.
[221:30.54]I don't mind it.
[221:31.48]I think it looks OK.
[221:33.60]You know, as long as you're OK with the way you look.
[221:36.48]Who gives a fuck what anybody else has to say?
[221:39.30]You know what I mean?
[221:46.00]Fold it.
[221:56.07]Everybody says you are handsome, though.
[221:58.31]Who cares what everybody has to say?
[221:59.53]You know what I mean?
[222:00.19]People can be mean.
[222:02.21]Oh, you're handsome.
[222:02.87]People can be cruel.
[222:04.27]You look great today.
[222:05.71]Don't worry about what people have to say about you.
[222:07.57]You know what I mean?
[222:07.99]It's not a big deal.
[222:12.58]Where is this going?
[222:25.30]Again?
[222:25.60]Flip it around.
[222:26.36]Why do I keep flipping it around?
[222:28.56]Oh, shit.
[222:29.18]This is going to go over here, huh?
[222:31.76]Where?
[222:33.62]Line up the control panel.
[222:35.78]What?
[222:39.04]What in the name of God is this doing?
[222:40.71]I need two grommets.
[222:52.12]I'm not sure if this stream sucks or not.
[222:54.34]It sucks pretty bad.
[223:04.60]If you're new to the channel, we do every Labo.
[223:07.74]Every single one.
[223:12.05]Every Labo is done on this stream.
[223:15.09]So if you don't like it,
[223:21.60]There's a door right there.
[223:27.92]You probably have one too.
[223:39.04]That means everybody leave.
[223:40.52]No, that means if you like it, stay.
[223:42.38]If you don't, then I'll see you soon.
[223:43.90]You don't have to love the Labo streams.
[223:47.70]I do.
[223:49.86]And that's all that...
[223:51.34]matters right it's me it's not only matters Jerma I'm outside well what are you doing still on Twitch oh he's hemorrhaging viewers who cares
[224:22.69]I built a birdhouse to less people.
[224:24.53]Who gives a shit?
[224:27.65]Alright, let's go.
[224:29.45]Grommet.
[224:33.19]I'm doing it wrong.
[224:36.75]Fuck.
[224:42.31]I thought somebody was just back seating me.
[224:47.28]Like bad.
[224:49.06]Oh shit, I actually did fuck it up.
[224:52.64]I'm not sure if this stream sucks or not.
[224:55.84]Thanks for the confidence boost.
[225:00.30]God damn it.
[225:04.87]I need a coin to get in here.
[225:12.61]Ow!
[225:19.70]I actually did lick it.
[225:20.66]Fuck!
[225:21.10]I didn't mean to.
[225:30.91]I was pretending to lick it.
[225:42.09]Jesus Christ, man.
[225:43.52]I'm sure this stream sucks.
[225:52.16]Hey, don't say that about my stream.
[225:56.00]I work real hard on these.
[225:57.82]Where did it go?
[226:02.71]It's right there.
[226:03.87]No, don't.
[226:06.59]Yes, I'm wearing two different socks.
[226:08.12]You have to fucking deal with it, alright?
[226:09.58]I worked real hard on this shit.
[226:15.18]Alright, what do I need to do?
[226:22.43]So this goes underneath.
[226:33.72]this and lines up like that okay alright then it goes through thanks for catching that by the way somebody caught that I would have been miserable if I didn't know look we do whatever on this string don't you have you figured that out yet
[227:03.07]Some of you longtime subscribers are still like, wait, what's he doing today?
[227:06.73]We do whatever we want.
[227:12.39]Come on, man.
[227:15.04]Wait, does this go on here?
[227:22.96]It doesn't.
[227:27.70]We want auto.
[227:28.72]Alright, I'll give you auto.
[227:33.23]at some point in the near future.
[227:40.79]Oh God, we're getting real intricate here.
[227:43.67]Okay, so then this moves here and then this comes over?
[227:52.74]Now where does this go?
[227:53.48]Like this?
[227:56.46]Alright, that's really weird.
[228:02.73]Remember the core bit, it actually goes inside the LSS2.
[228:05.55]Go ahead and get it ready.
[228:08.89]Check the direction of the eyelet house.
[228:11.49]If the side where you inserted the tab is on the inside, then you're all good to go.
[228:14.85]It is.
[228:18.47]Slide the core along until it comes to rest against the eyelet's house.
[228:25.55]What the fuck?
[228:26.57]Okay, so like this.
[228:33.05]What's a bourbon wine?
[228:33.95]I have no idea.
[228:34.55]It kind of tastes good though.
[228:37.19]The rubber band hasn't been come loose.
[228:39.17]Check quickly to make sure and fix it.
[228:40.47]No, it's not.
[228:43.03]Oh dear.
[228:43.57]We have to fold the whole thing around this like a sandwich.
[228:47.98]It'll look like a piece of sushi.
[228:53.30]Roll up the sides around the whole thing like this.
[229:02.69]Oh my goodness.
[229:08.48]This goes under here like that.
[229:17.34]Um.
[229:19.86]Ah.
[229:30.86]Am I supposed to close this up?
[229:32.70]Like this?
[229:34.30]There it is.
[229:34.70]There it is.
[229:34.96]There it is.
[229:35.22]There it is.
[229:35.46]There it is.
[229:35.72]Don't move.
[229:36.02]Don't move.
[229:39.56]Let's go back.
[229:42.98]This comes up first.
[229:45.47]Slide it there.
[229:46.21]This comes up all the way.
[229:48.33]Like that.
[229:50.65]And then this side comes up here.
[229:58.67]Which leaves this here.
[230:02.33]Like that.
[230:02.93]Okay, and this closes down there.
[230:07.65]Oh my God.
[230:10.02]Alright, so how do I connect this together?
[230:23.07]Hold them in one place until we can secure them.
[230:26.71]See this little flap over here.
[230:32.42]yeah fold it up it'll help keep everything in place for now really well I just hold it that really did work okay it actually worked and then the rubber band comes up and goes over and around the whole thing that's it
[231:03.37]Make this up and around.
[231:11.78]I think that's good.
[231:16.44]Looks like it's alright.
[231:19.28]I don't know.
[231:23.50]Yeah, no, it's in there.
[231:26.64]And then we fold this shit up.
[231:32.49]We'll fold up the control panel next first, raise up the skinny arms.
[231:34.97]Oh my God.
[231:37.95]This is elaborate.
[231:44.36]And then bring them to connect the arms by sliding the notch.
[231:49.50]So I'm connecting these like that.
[231:58.05]Yeah.
[232:04.32]Once that's done, lift up the sides.
[232:09.51]Like this.
[232:10.25]Holy shit.
[232:12.07]This is crazy.
[232:12.73]It comes up and this folds down and this comes across here.
[232:23.95]This is looking like a rocket launcher, that's for sure.
[232:25.79]So we have to do more building on that.
[232:32.31]Then... No, that's over here.
[232:36.93]Get this.
[232:38.47]Where does this go?
[232:44.90]Rubber band should be on the other side of the tab, isn't it though?
[232:47.68]Looks like it is.
[232:50.62]That's not on the other side.
[232:51.92]Looks like it is.
[232:55.10]That's in the right spot, right?
[232:57.62]This thing looks cool.
[232:58.42]Yeah, lavos are cool.
[233:01.25]They really are.
[233:01.83]I broke the tabs here.
[233:06.57]It's cool to see it come together, regardless of how the game is.
[233:10.59]It's cool to make a little device.
[233:11.81]You know, it's cool to make a King's Landing.
[233:17.13]It's in the front, it goes in the front?
[233:18.82]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[233:25.62]Thank you, everybody, for giving me the tips that I need.
[233:36.51]That's in the front.
[233:37.77]That's good to go, right in the front.
[233:40.15]So then what does this do?
[233:43.21]This next bit might surprise you.
[233:44.77]Lift up the whole thing and align it like so.
[233:50.98]What's the arrow?
[233:52.34]Arrow.
[233:54.12]And it goes in.
[233:55.00]The mark on the end should be the line.
[233:59.67]Yeah, it is.
[234:00.17]Like that.
[234:03.95]And then it goes down.
[234:12.17]all the way in.
[234:15.87]God.
[234:23.07]Come on, come on, and... Oh, I see, look at that.
[234:32.49]Here's the tube.
[234:35.37]This is cool.
[234:37.04]Nice, alright.
[234:40.18]Let's stick it up here.
[234:43.31]These tabs go back inside.
[234:45.19]Weirdly enough, they kind of fold back in on themselves.
[234:50.41]Like this.
[234:52.19]There's one.
[234:52.67]And the other one's on this other side.
[234:55.57]I can't really get it though.
[234:57.55]There we go.
[235:03.96]Done.
[235:05.02]Cool.
[235:07.44]Now what?
[235:13.63]Pull it to the right.
[235:14.27]When you let go, does it snap back into place?
[235:16.29]That's pretty fucking cool.
[235:26.45]So it's like... So it's like a little shotgun.
[235:36.86]How'd they think of this shit?
[235:37.66]I have no idea.
[235:45.25]The LSS is ready for launch.
[235:53.01]Alright, next part.
[235:53.69]Well, that's the second step complete.
[235:54.85]The front of the toy is now all done.
[235:56.21]Why not take a break?
[235:58.42]I don't think I need a break.
[236:01.28]Making the clacker.
[236:02.44]So we need C and F. C and F. We're at the home stretch.
[236:15.35]like another hour and a half.
[236:18.01]Maybe like another two hours.
[236:21.07]We need this thing in the middle.
[236:27.25]What is a clacker?
[236:28.03]What does that mean?
[236:30.80]Clacker.
[236:33.38]And then let's see.
[236:39.50]Do an auto break?
[236:40.36]No, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[236:41.78]I wanna get this done.
[236:43.66]Because once this is done and I play with it for five seconds, we'll just hang out in the chat for a little while.
[236:49.57]Another glass of wine and we'll go on our merry way, you know?
[236:52.51]Alright, looks good.
[236:58.67]I'm going to move this out of the way because I don't think I need it right this second.
[237:06.80]Alright.
[237:08.28]A little spaceship here.
[237:09.28]Let's punch out the necessary things.
[237:20.03]It needs to be like that.
[237:23.43]Hang out, Jupiter?
[237:24.33]Yeah, we'll just hang out for a while.
[237:28.41]Because I don't have the other... They don't sell them together.
[237:31.30]They're all sold out.
[237:33.74]I went to GameStop.
[237:35.32]I went to Best Buy, Target.
[237:38.60]I went everywhere.
[237:39.94]Nobody has this shit.
[237:41.90]You have to buy this on the Nintendo official website shop.
[237:46.24]It's not on Amazon either.
[237:47.78]You can't get the whole kit on Amazon right now.
[237:49.62]It's all locked out.
[237:52.14]You could spend like 110 bucks to get it from some third party, but I apparently bought it too late.
[237:59.62]Wait, should I not be doing that?
[238:01.28]Hold on.
[238:07.23]Take that sheet of marker stickers.
[238:12.35]This thing, okay.
[238:17.96]Bend the sheet?
[238:19.33]No, I can see it.
[238:21.95]I can see it just fine.
[238:22.83]So the sticker is on this part of the sheet.
[238:28.01]It's right in the middle.
[238:30.68]Alright, I see.
[238:32.32]You can't see, but I can.
[238:33.34]That's all that matters is that I can see.
[238:45.31]I'm trying to see so hard.
[238:47.22]It's the wrong piece.
[238:51.56]I can't see help.
[239:01.19]I'm gonna do some punching.
[239:04.93]You know, I need I need like a little pen to just go like so much easier than my finger.
[239:14.12]This is a little too late now, though.
[239:21.64]Use your teeth.
[239:22.62]No, I can't bite into this shit.
[239:25.28]That'd be bad news.
[239:26.13]Close that out.
[239:34.81]Come here.
[239:36.57]Come here.
[239:38.83]Okay, so now...
[239:41.81]Right here needs to be this big sticker right here.
[239:44.49]The big one.
[239:46.33]The large one.
[239:49.64]The biggest one on the sheet.
[239:51.38]Don't pull them all off.
[239:53.08]That goes right on top of it like this, right?
[240:00.24]Oh, no.
[240:02.36]Fuck.
[240:03.14]Come on.
[240:04.10]Come on.
[240:04.52]It sticks so much.
[240:12.30]Good, good.
[240:15.56]I was going, did he lick the cartridge yet?
[240:17.14]Yeah, I did.
[240:19.78]Against my better judgment, yes I did.
[240:21.12]Alright, fold it all.
[240:28.01]It was on accident though, to be fair.
[240:46.79]Fold it.
[240:50.13]Okay.
[240:54.01]Every little piece needs to be turned.
[240:59.25]Oh, Nintendo.
[241:08.97]Fold, fold, fold it, crease it.
[241:17.91]Again, crease, fold, fold, fold, fold.
[241:27.18]Go, go, go.
[241:47.88]How did you lick it accidentally with prior judgment?
[241:49.94]Because I pretended to lick it, but I went too far.
[241:52.94]I pretended to lick it for the joke.
[241:55.14]And my tongue touched it.
[241:57.14]Unfortunately.
[241:58.16]It's the truth.
[242:07.01]It went too far.
[242:08.15]I'm not good with depth perception.
[242:11.01]Have you seen me slap myself in the face before?
[242:15.82]I have done that.
[242:17.74]This folds in.
[242:19.46]These ones go out.
[242:21.32]Out and out.
[242:21.90]These come in all the way.
[242:24.72]Does it do the whole thing?
[242:26.20]Like this?
[242:28.53]I think so.
[242:32.15]Lick the table.
[242:33.09]No, I'm sorry.
[242:33.83]That's not going to happen.
[242:34.63]That actually will not happen.
[242:38.56]There's like jokey lick the cartridge and then there is embarrassing, I'm embarrassed for you, you're licking the table like you're, I don't wanna be here anymore.
[242:49.42]And then I lose 500 people.
[242:53.53]There's a difference, there really is.
[242:56.31]I close it up.
[243:03.63]Same deal.
[243:05.59]Fold this piece up like that.
[243:09.98]So many Jupiters, this is a lot of Jupes.
[243:12.34]Some pretty good Jupes tonight.
[243:15.00]From what I've seen, they've been pretty good.
[243:16.24]Do these go in too?
[243:19.88]Hold on.
[243:20.92]Flaps go in?
[243:21.72]Yeah, close to do.
[243:24.28]In, in, stick.
[243:26.66]There we go.
[243:30.03]I don't even know what I'm making here.
[243:32.35]A clacker.
[243:34.55]I don't know what a clacker is.
[243:40.95]Is it going to be like a... Probably.
[243:50.21]Snap it all in.
[243:52.25]Can you see the marker sticker through the windows in the hand?
[243:55.05]They look like robot eyes and the opening below is the mouth.
[244:00.25]I think you can see them.
[244:02.93]I can.
[244:03.53]Can you?
[244:04.51]Good.
[244:08.09]Only boomers know what a clacker is.
[244:12.64]I'm a late millennial.
[244:14.54]An early millennial.
[244:15.40]I'm not even a boomer.
[244:18.22]I never understood that joke.
[244:21.33]Okay, more stickers.
[244:24.13]One, two.
[244:24.97]These go where?
[244:27.55]Right here.
[244:29.25]Right on the dot.
[244:34.29]I'm not even 38.
[244:35.07]I turned 39 in fucking September.
[244:39.80]Come on, guys.
[244:43.91]I turned 37 in August.
[244:45.25]There we go.
[244:55.72]Tiny fall lines on each of the robot feet.
[244:58.70]Fold them back.
[245:02.22]I did that right, right?
[245:07.12]You sound like you were raised in the 30s.
[245:10.67]What are you talking about?
[245:12.19]The way that I talk?
[245:21.56]Four than one.
[245:22.22]You sound like you were raised in the 30s.
[245:26.21]I don't think I talk like this.
[245:28.97]Possible, but I don't think I do.
[245:32.77]Everybody born in the 30s talked like this.
[245:35.97]Lots of inflection.
[245:38.03]Sort of a weird fake British accent that was not really British.
[245:41.01]It was American.
[245:43.01]1930s American.
[245:43.85]What even was that accent?
[245:51.55]It was like, we're still British, but we're not quite British anymore.
[246:06.37]Transatlantic, right.
[246:13.65]It's true.
[246:16.48]Inflation hit accents hard.
[246:22.59]Alright, let's get this part done.
[246:24.68]Whoa.
[246:31.58]Alright, so these... Like that?
[246:38.06]Wow.
[246:38.58]So how do they... Do I have to combine them together?
[246:41.03]That was a stuffy nose.
[246:44.03]Okay, so I have to combine these little hands together.
[246:46.37]Ah!
[246:47.89]Wow.
[246:50.83]Wow.
[246:51.74]Okay, then these fold in to make a little... Right?
[247:02.14]They don't stay down though.
[247:05.28]The next part requires some gymnastics.
[247:07.11]Take the top of the robot head all the way over and then stick it down through here.
[247:16.77]That's pretty cool.
[247:19.09]That's exactly what I just did.
[247:29.41]Another one of these.
[247:31.20]Goes right in the front, right?
[247:33.36]Across the whole star.
[247:36.48]More wine?
[247:41.74]Relax.
[247:44.54]What are you drinking?
[247:46.11]Those of you that are 21 or in your jurisdiction that you're allowed to drink, what are you drinking?
[247:51.97]Water?
[247:54.79]Soda?
[247:55.61]Beer?
[247:56.57]Cider?
[247:57.84]Lemonade?
[247:58.86]Absinthe?
[248:00.34]Absinthe!
[248:01.63]I saw an absinthe.
[248:04.31]Alright, you're ready to fucking go.
[248:08.05]Now I know why you're watching this stream.
[248:12.15]Holy shit, man, I'm freaking out.
[248:13.54]This guy's making a giant blaster in cardboard.
[248:16.46]I can't even take it.
[248:19.18]I'm fucking losing my mind.
[248:20.52]Alright, so this just goes right here.
[248:30.02]that so then we're done with these for now what did you miss dude you missed so much you have no idea I showed a dog I showed Otto yep okay so this goes what does it want what the hell is it doing so I had it right like this like that
[249:00.80]Okay.
[249:05.24]Can I borrow your car?
[249:06.10]I'm low on gas.
[249:09.26]No, dude, get out of here.
[249:12.54]Take a lift.
[249:17.25]Stick those in.
[249:18.99]Tab in, tab in, tab in, tab in.
[249:20.85]Just gotta connect them.
[249:22.75]This looks cool.
[249:23.75]It's like a little spaceship.
[249:32.66]Don't take a lift at 8, though.
[249:38.92]What do you mean, don't take a lift at 8, though?
[249:40.42]I don't know, what does that mean?
[249:44.59]Don't take a lift at 8.
[249:47.49]Why not?
[249:50.13]What does that mean?
[249:50.73]Don't take a lift at 8?
[249:56.23]8?
[249:56.25]Take a lift.
[249:58.65]Oh, shit, where does this go?
[249:59.96]Oh.
[250:07.50]There it is, right?
[250:12.76]There's a strike.
[250:15.57]Oh, what do you mean a strike?
[250:18.83]Where?
[250:20.57]Like everywhere?
[250:22.71]Don't take a car on the lift?
[250:25.25]Don't take a lift on the 8th?
[250:28.91]Here.
[250:31.61]Oh, it's the actual company.
[250:34.69]I thought you meant there was like a big strike going on somewhere and like, don't take a car.
[250:38.22]It's going to be crazy going through.
[250:39.92]I didn't know that.
[250:43.26]Alright.
[250:43.46]Well, don't take, don't take a lift on the 8th.
[250:45.14]Alright.
[250:49.66]I thought that was like a big protest or a big strike or something and be careful.
[250:54.59]But what city?
[250:55.71]That's why I was like, what are you talking about?
[251:02.07]He's a fucking boomer.
[251:03.75]I'm not a boomer.
[251:04.47]Alright, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
[251:05.53]We're gonna put this device into this, hold on, this is gonna be cool.
[251:09.71]This is like three hours of work.
[251:11.27]I can't wait to fucking just smash it and rip it in half and laugh in the camera.
[251:15.95]Okay, so this goes like this.
[251:21.50]Line the clacker up like on screen, then into the tube it goes.
[251:27.96]Like this, am I doing this right?
[251:30.66]Am I doing this right?
[251:41.55]Like that, right?
[251:46.87]Yeah, I am.
[251:47.35]Okay, so how far down does it go?
[251:51.43]Line the clacker.
[251:52.17]Yeah, the clacker's lined up.
[251:54.13]The clacker's lined up with the arrows.
[252:00.20]Oh, I dropped it.
[252:02.75]Hey!
[252:03.85]There we go.
[252:04.37]It's supposed to go down there.
[252:05.89]Alright, make sure the clacker ended up in the same place as the one on the screen.
[252:09.49]It did.
[252:15.29]Now we've got to secure the clacker.
[252:19.53]Next we'll be opening up some tabs on the clacker and make sure that it doesn't move around and hold it down from above.
[252:26.89]Where's the clacker?
[252:28.68]The clacker's right here.
[252:31.92]okay opening up some tabs on the clacker huh open up this tab this one here and then what oh I need a rubber a small so that's out small rubber band dude okay so this is like 40 bucks
[253:01.87]I would pay, imagine like a $5,000 labo and you can make a real house.
[253:09.33]Or like an airplane.
[253:11.51]Like a two-scale backyard airplane.
[253:13.99]It would be like four grand.
[253:16.86]That'd be fucking cool.
[253:18.98]I would do a full backyard airplane labo.
[253:23.26]I would hire five people.
[253:27.40]Alright, what do I do?
[253:30.08]This goes around here.
[253:33.85]Stick it out.
[253:34.39]I said make sure it doesn't move, but it kind of is.
[253:39.27]Where does it go from there?
[253:41.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[253:42.28]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[253:43.94]I gotta put it through and then close it.
[253:48.46]This is fucking nuts.
[253:59.69]Insanity!
[254:02.39]Insanity!
[254:03.47]I don't, this is not, this doesn't feel that secure.
[254:07.56]Alright.
[254:16.02]In.
[254:16.96]Now what?
[254:18.37]Oh dear god, now I have to go over here and across through here
[254:28.92]I feel like it's not going to work.
[254:30.04]I guess it did.
[254:31.34]I guess that's right, right?
[254:38.77]And then put this down.
[254:40.15]Which, I mean, that's as far down as it can go.
[254:46.84]Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?
[254:49.94]Fuck right, fuck right.
[254:53.86]Okay.
[254:58.57]Yeah, that looks right.
[255:03.31]Do the same thing on the other side, okay.
[255:07.21]Small rubber band.
[255:12.31]What's the best Far Cry game?
[255:16.64]I want it on a scale of one to five.
[255:22.64]Three, no.
[255:25.86]Two, no.
[255:31.14]One?
[255:31.40]No.
[255:33.52]Oh, I don't think so.
[255:37.36]Blood Dragon?
[255:38.14]No.
[255:38.90]I don't know about that.
[255:46.45]None of them?
[255:47.21]Yeah.
[255:49.03]Yeah, I think so.
[255:57.95]I'm kidding.
[255:59.17]Relax, relax.
[256:00.80]It's a joke.
[256:02.42]This is a comedy stream.
[256:04.12]I'm a comedy streamer.
[256:05.78]Says it in my description.
[256:06.94]Go look at it.
[256:09.44]Go look at my channel description right now.
[256:11.56]What does it say?
[256:16.45]YouTuber for five years.
[256:17.99]Decided to do the Twitch thing as well.
[256:20.19]Hope you like it.
[256:22.23]It says it right there that I'm a fucking comedian in the channel.
[256:34.91]Alright, so that's done too.
[256:37.47]Make sure it's in both.
[256:42.61]That's it, right?
[256:46.15]Is a -2 and a +2 still legal?
[256:48.91]Yeah.
[256:49.83]That means it was zero.
[256:52.73]You can't give me a fucking -2 on that one.
[256:56.21]That's my own channel.
[257:01.91]What the fuck, are you a cop?
[257:07.05]I can't reach it.
[257:08.43]How do I reach the wine from here?
[257:11.17]I don't want to stand up.
[257:12.21]My bum is sore.
[257:13.19]It'll hurt even more.
[257:15.11]You even do that when you sit up and it's like, ow!
[257:16.89]I wish I had fucking Jedi powers.
[257:27.10]Alright.
[257:30.84]Get a gamer chair?
[257:32.40]What a waste of money.
[257:34.02]No thanks.
[257:47.20]I'm not gonna get a gamer chair.
[257:53.01]Why would you ever get a gamer chair?
[257:54.41]I mean, if you have one and you like it, cool.
[257:59.31]But a chair is a chair.
[258:00.67]They're just chairs.
[258:02.41]It's a chair.
[258:03.93]You sit in a chair.
[258:09.90]I could bring a folding metal chair out here and be fine.
[258:12.88]I would play a game and be fine.
[258:15.71]Nah, you need to spend like 200 bucks on one of these chairs.
[258:20.70]Just lie on the ground.
[258:22.34]What?
[258:23.56]Just lie on your back on the fucking ground and play your game.
[258:28.82]Sit on your couch.
[258:38.04]No, I don't want to sit in like the backseat of a Toyota Camry to play all my video games.
[258:46.53]I'll get a goddamn chair from Staples for 40 bucks.
[258:49.59]I mean, this chair was 400, but... You get the idea.
[259:02.88]What's the next step?
[259:07.40]So, look, it's a default fucking chair, look.
[259:11.64]Look at my chair, okay?
[259:13.96]This is my chair.
[259:15.84]It's just, I'm kidding, this was like not that much money, it was.
[259:21.82]This was more expensive than all the Game Bird chairs.
[259:24.98]But it's better, in every way.
[259:27.14]I got lumbar support.
[259:32.31]I feel good when I sit in here.
[259:37.61]Default skin chair?
[259:39.23]No, I don't want the fucking thing up here.
[259:44.94]When you sit in those gamer chairs, you're like... Oh, hey, we're... What's it say?
[259:54.21]Hey, we've been moving an ad all stream.
[259:58.12]Get one of these, guys.
[260:01.12]Ow, my back.
[260:03.82]Hey, what's going on, man?
[260:04.82]Yeah, we're just chilling out, playing some Fortnite.
[260:06.88]Ow.
[260:18.39]I don't, I don't, I don't, I kind of don't, I don't understand why my, why my spine hurts every day.
[260:24.90]Wait.
[260:27.60]Yeah.
[260:30.36]No, it's going good.
[260:31.61]No, I love this chair.
[260:37.17]Got him.
[260:37.89]Got him.
[260:38.45]Hold on, I need to take a break.
[260:39.33]Oh, fuck.
[260:41.03]Ow.
[260:50.06]You just complained about your butt hurting.
[260:53.30]Yeah, because... Do you see what I'm dealing with here?
[260:59.41]Look at this.
[261:01.45]I'm hiding my penis because people are out of control.
[261:05.85]I have to, like, sit under here.
[261:10.44]I have to sit, like, under the table.
[261:15.52]Because people are like...
[261:22.77]Did he stand up?
[261:23.43]I gotta be like under the table.
[261:33.02]No wonder my ass hurts.
[261:34.02]I'm not sitting in the chair.
[261:35.68]If I was sitting in the chair, I wouldn't be like stuffed under the table.
[261:39.22]Like this.
[261:40.30]Guys, the table, look at this.
[261:43.50]You understand?
[261:45.22]I'm wearing the table right now.
[261:48.10]That's how this works.
[261:49.74]This is me wearing this thing.
[261:57.61]This is how I have to sit.
[261:59.84]Because we've got a bunch of fucking jokesters.
[262:05.16]I'm like the fat kid in a Disney cartoon.
[262:09.33]Oh, no.
[262:11.97]It's time for lunch.
[262:12.81]Bell rings.
[262:35.20]That was a chicken little tear joke.
[262:37.34]I'm just saying.
[262:38.58]I've got to be like, I've got to hide.
[262:40.32]I have to hide my body.
[262:44.83]Chicken little.
[262:47.57]Get out of town.
[262:48.51]Oh yeah.
[262:53.23]Excuse me.
[262:56.40]That actually kind of made like a loud noise.
[263:00.63]My monitor.
[263:02.05]My monitor just like changed colors for like two seconds.
[263:07.66]It was like I could see the crystal plasma.
[263:12.88]I think it's alright.
[263:14.46]That went out hard.
[263:16.56]It was like BOOM!
[263:23.63]Make sure you remind me that there is a rubber band on the floor.
[263:28.95]Because I won't remember.
[263:33.57]Buy a new table.
[263:34.39]Why would I buy a new table?
[263:35.41]This is a fuck you table.
[263:36.37]We already went over this.
[263:37.85]You see how dirty and shitty this table is?
[263:42.94]I will never get rid of my fuck you table.
[263:48.20]I can eat on here.
[263:49.24]I can fucking pick it up.
[263:50.42]I can stick on it.
[263:51.34]I can punch things.
[263:55.15]It's on the floor.
[263:55.73]I know.
[264:02.30]How much wine did he have?
[264:04.52]Not that, no, Kim, not that much.
[264:10.18]Not, really not that much.
[264:11.61]I'm making, I'm making a reference to the fact that, look, I'll show you.
[264:14.59]You can see how much I'm drinking.
[264:16.27]It's over there.
[264:17.05]I can't read you, but I, I, not that much.
[264:21.45]I, people are just, people are just being funny and making funny references and jokes.
[264:34.24]I broke, I did not break the castle.
[264:36.14]Uh oh.
[264:37.24]What the, guys, what the fuck are you doing?
[264:44.17]I thought we were cool.
[264:47.39]I thought we were cool.
[264:52.65]Just like snitching immediately?
[264:54.99]In two seconds?
[264:56.51]I thought we were fucking cool.
[265:01.13]Alright, so the next part is F.

[265:44.18]I'm actually looking for a headset from this far away.
[265:46.32]Alright, F. I need only a couple pieces, just a couple little ones, right?
[265:56.63]This one here, and this one here.
[266:03.39]What is he not wearing, pants?
[266:10.48]Look, it's a pair of shorts.
[266:14.25]It's a pair of fucking shorts that have a zipper on them.
[266:17.73]Relax.
[266:19.63]Look.
[266:28.64]Is he not wearing pants?
[266:29.92]What are you talking about?
[266:31.10]Why would I not wear pants?
[266:35.00]You want to get banned on Twitch?
[266:38.62]I'm not going to wear pants this time.
[266:42.18]Bye.
[266:42.60]I'll be gone forever.
[266:47.23]Let's get this out of the way.
[266:50.79]Four fold line, so I'm right here.
[266:55.90]Salmon or pizza for dinner?
[266:57.00]Ooh.
[266:57.58]Fuck.
[267:02.90]Fly is not down, relax.
[267:05.56]Salmon or pizza?
[267:06.36]Oh boy, probably, ooh.
[267:07.86]That's tough.
[267:12.64]Somebody put a straw poll in chat and tell me what it is.
[267:22.32]Put the salmon on the pizza.
[267:24.68]Disgusting.
[267:27.90]Alright, so that's folded.
[267:29.00]I see a straw pulled right now.
[267:33.58]Let's see.
[267:34.06]What do you guys got?
[267:36.06]What does it want me to do?
[267:39.15]So this folds in and then folds together like this.
[267:43.09]I think I'm... Am I fucking this up?
[267:45.51]No, no, no.
[267:45.93]Folds in and then together.
[267:49.67]Slow down!
[267:51.38]Slow down, you're not cool.
[267:54.85]That doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look annoying.
[267:56.71]So where does this go?
[268:07.00]I'm just so happy.
[268:09.08]I'm so happy.
[268:11.26]That, like, everyone watching this stream right now that knows about, like, the rumors, you're never going to be a rumor.
[268:17.22]You're not.
[268:18.23]I'm so happy that this was a 36, 3700 people here.
[268:21.77]None of you are going to be rumors.
[268:23.93]None of you.
[268:24.73]Because you're going to be like, oh, that sucks.
[268:26.69]That person sucks.
[268:29.07]Okay.
[268:31.01]Where does this go?
[268:39.52]In right in here, right?
[268:43.20]It's a weird place.
[268:43.90]This is the crosshair?
[268:47.26]Make sure it's the right way up, like that.
[268:50.50]Stick it right in the middle there.
[268:51.86]It's kinda moving around.
[268:57.40]Like that?
[268:58.62]I mean, that's in there.
[268:59.33]It doesn't feel that secure, but it's in there.
[269:01.71]I guess.
[269:07.59]I drive an N7 with a loud rotary engine.
[269:12.65]Do you drive down the same street every single day, like 20 times a day, going as fast as you can on that road?
[269:17.22]That's probably like a 40, that's probably like a 35 mile per hour road, and you're going like 55 every day.
[269:23.24]Do you do that?
[269:24.38]You don't do that.
[269:25.46]I know you don't.
[269:26.74]You don't do that.
[269:32.13]Why would you do that?
[269:32.73]You wouldn't.
[269:35.27]You wouldn't do that.
[269:36.89]Think of the children.
[269:38.11]Think of the kids.
[269:39.47]You drive by that fast going like 55 in a 30.
[269:42.54]Look at the children, for God's sakes.
[269:45.24]Do you hear them laughing?
[269:49.92]They're over there playing.
[269:51.20]You're going to go 55 in a 30?
[269:56.40]Do you hear the ball?
[269:57.44]Like a little ball being bounced?
[270:01.94]You look over, you see them playing basketball in the driveway?
[270:05.02]You're going to go 55 in a 30?
[270:15.86]Set up a camera and speed check them.
[270:17.62]But then I'm like the fucking nosy Nancy that's up there with the radar gun.
[270:23.31]I got you, motherfucker.
[270:27.25]I'll be all like on the corner, like, they'll drive by me.
[270:33.56]That was 50.
[270:33.98]What am I gonna do?
[270:36.94]I know I'm gonna call the police.
[270:42.80]Yes, police?
[270:44.98]Yes, it's me, Nancy.
[270:47.60]Yes, they drove by very fast.
[270:50.63]Did you get their license plate?
[270:51.75]No.
[270:54.61]Okay.
[270:55.97]So you'll patrol?
[270:57.28]Good.
[270:59.62]That hurt.
[271:03.90]A lot.
[271:15.78]Where was that piece?
[271:22.23]I didn't have an actual phone in my hand.
[271:29.90]There was no phone in my hand to do the prop.
[271:33.14]I'm an actor, okay?
[271:34.90]I can take it.
[271:37.93]Fold it up in half like that.
[271:41.89]Looks like you're having salmon pizza for dinner.
[271:43.55]No.
[271:43.95]Alright.
[271:44.93]Let's go with salmon.
[271:47.51]Salmon.
[271:48.87]Yeah.
[271:50.35]Oh, yeah.
[271:51.03]Salmon.
[271:52.85]Oh, yeah.
[271:54.37]Oh, yeah.
[271:54.91]Salmon.
[271:55.68]Yeah.
[271:57.14]What do we say to salmon?
[271:59.04]You know.
[272:03.70]Filthy rich streamer.
[272:05.14]Salmon is like $4.00.
[272:11.50]Alright.
[272:11.92]Okay.
[272:12.26]All the way up.
[272:16.43]In here.
[272:17.31]Oh man.
[272:19.77]This thing is so sick.
[272:20.73]I can't wait to like.
[272:24.52]Hold on.
[272:24.86]Let me like.
[272:43.13]Where's it going?
[272:44.28]Straight up.
[272:49.90]And what does it, I don't know, what's that attaching?
[272:52.82]The clacker is attached!
[272:57.81]Banned for TOS.
[272:58.85]Hey!
[273:03.35]Listen up.
[273:05.03]It's illegal in Las Vegas.
[273:12.83]I'm not gonna do any hand motions.
[273:15.65]But, okay.
[273:18.87]I was gonna do a bunch of hand motions.
[273:20.27]Alright, stop doing fucking hand motions!
[273:24.83]The chairs are uncomfortable.
[273:29.02]He's not beat, he's not beat!
[273:33.34]Fuck!
[273:35.76]He's not beat, yep.
[273:38.96]Yeah, how much money did I get for this?
[273:41.35]Not enough.
[273:42.03]Not enough.
[273:43.77]Ah!
[273:44.81]Ah!
[273:46.00]Ah.
[273:51.02]Uh, four to five.
[273:55.86]I'm almost done.
[273:58.18]Making the grip.
[273:58.79]Oh, we're gonna get a grip.
[274:03.77]Only two more steps.
[274:05.35]Alright, let's get this.
[274:06.35]So what is the clacker?
[274:07.41]Can I, am I gonna fuck this up if I...
[274:36.09]Yeah!
[274:38.61]I said I wasn't gonna do hand motions, but I can't help it.
[274:43.82]Okay.
[274:46.02]We need a G&H.
[274:54.60]How long has this been?
[274:55.36]It's almost been five hours.
[274:58.21]Are you shitting me?
[275:01.69]That's a long fucking time for one blaster.
[275:04.11]Alright.
[275:06.70]This piece here.
[275:16.31]Take a sip.
[275:17.23]I've taken plenty of sips.
[275:22.77]The whole thing, right?
[275:36.06]Those of you guys get it?
[275:37.46]The more that I drink, the less likely there's a stream tomorrow.
[275:45.68]Every sip increases the time forward for when the stream starts tomorrow afternoon.
[275:57.13]All of a sudden, now everybody wants me to slow down.
[276:11.61]Now you said salmon.
[276:12.47]Now I want salmon pizza.
[276:14.71]I would eat salmon pizza right now and I would pretend to love it.
[276:18.93]The manager would come over.
[276:19.97]How was everything tonight?
[276:22.15]Oh, it was fantastic.
[276:24.30]Why do we do that, by the way?
[276:25.36]What's wrong with people?
[276:29.84]There's too much sauce on this.
[276:33.66]No, I mean, it's okay.
[276:36.12]I think there's too much sauce and the noodles are underdone.
[276:40.89]No, I'm not sure if I really like it.
[276:42.40]It's okay.
[276:43.60]Oh, how's everything doing?
[276:44.50]Oh, oh, oh, it's fantastic.
[276:46.06]I love it.
[276:46.48]Fantastic.
[276:54.95]Why don't, why don't you tell them?
[277:00.27]How's your burger?
[277:01.39]Oh, it's really, like, overdone.
[277:03.13]It's, like, I wanted medium, but it's, like, well done.
[277:06.07]The lettuce is, like, really wilty and gross.
[277:08.52]Oh, and
[277:10.45]Oh, ma'am, how's your burger?
[277:11.91]Oh, fantastic, thank you.
[277:13.17]Oh, the burger sucks.
[277:18.61]Tell him.
[277:19.79]Why do we do that?
[277:20.99]What's wrong with us?
[277:44.76]I can still hear him.
[277:45.37]Are you still going?
[277:57.66]Are you in that car?
[277:59.20]Like, the person in that car.
[278:00.40]Somebody said that you're that guy in that car.
[278:05.92]Yeah!
[278:07.24]Yeah!
[278:09.17]Yeah!
[278:11.49]What do you do?
[278:15.83]Oh, yeah!
[278:20.19]Yeah!
[278:21.39]Yeah, okay!
[278:26.59]Sick!
[278:29.92]He's still going!
[278:34.14]Go get Forza and fucking leave us alone!
[278:54.17]What are you doing?
[279:03.94]Oh, shit, a red light's coming up.
[279:07.12]Oh, fuck.
[279:08.64]It's okay.
[279:09.50]It's alright.
[279:10.32]I can only do that for like 12 seconds.
[279:13.66]Okay.
[279:15.32]Okay.
[279:16.04]Wow.
[279:17.04]Wow, what a rush.
[279:18.08]Wow.
[279:20.28]Fucking like...
[279:31.43]What else?
[279:31.71]What other pieces do I need?
[279:38.27]What was that?
[279:38.63]That was being arrested.
[279:39.54]That shit happens like fucking 25 times a day.
[279:46.38]Why?
[279:52.03]Don't you think, like, okay, eating the same food every day, it gets old.
[279:56.89]Imagine if you had, like, a hot dog every single day.
[280:00.05]You're not going to be as excited for hot dogs anymore.
[280:02.67]If you eat 50 hot dogs in a week, the 51st hot dog is like, I don't know if I want to eat a hot dog right now.
[280:12.51]How many times do you have to speed down the same road before it's like, oh, this is kind of fucking dumb.
[280:18.21]I do this every day.
[280:19.93]I do this like 10 times a day.
[280:22.54]I guess I'm gonna do it again the 11th time.
[280:31.06]It's always the same road.
[280:34.81]I wonder if they do it in other places too.
[280:36.51]You know what I mean?
[280:40.90]Let me see.
[280:41.22]Let me look at a map.
[280:42.68]Let's get Google Maps out.
[280:45.42]That's not a bad one to vroom on.
[280:47.79]What about down the street over there?
[280:49.21]Let's go a few more kicks to the left.
[280:51.33]I like that.
[280:52.29]That's a good vroomer road.
[280:56.41]Go take a bath.
[280:59.44]Go soak for a while.
[281:01.32]You need it.
[281:12.04]I just picture, and I know I'm making up a character that doesn't exist, but I picture a person just like drinking something, like an energy drink or eating something out of their hand, like a fucking burger or something, and they speed and they just like throw the trash out the fucking window.
[281:31.79]I feel like they're a litterer, too.
[281:33.87]Not just a rumor.
[281:34.73]I feel like you're throwing styrofoam out the window.
[281:38.72]You've got a burger box, and it's the worst possible thing to throw out a fucking window.
[281:42.18]Styrofoam.
[281:43.48]Just like, I don't care.
[281:44.70]I don't care, don't you know?
[281:46.94]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[281:48.69]I'm just trying to build a children's toy here.
[282:04.23]Who cares?
[282:05.75]Oh, is that glass?
[282:08.72]Yeah.
[282:10.02]Get a fucking life.
[282:22.48]Anyways.
[282:22.84]Okay, these stickers.
[282:35.54]Where's this one go?
[282:39.92]Building, building, you're interrupting my building children's toys.
[282:43.95]I still gotta stand.
[282:52.20]Get a VR helmet and fucking get in a car game.
[282:54.82]Right in the middle?
[283:04.01]Get a life, says the guy playing with cardboard.
[283:06.93]I'm not affecting anybody else.
[283:09.57]My, okay, you could, good point, maybe, but if my, listen, that doesn't make, that's bullshit.
[283:15.98]You know why?
[283:17.52]If I opened up my window and leaned out the window and was screaming about every build I was doing.
[283:24.82]Hey, so now, hey, now I'm taking the cardboard and I'm turning it upside down and I'm plugging in the next piece.
[283:34.46]And now I'm taking the next piece.
[283:38.02]That's the difference.
[283:40.18]I'm not doing that.
[283:41.18]I'm not yelling out this window.
[283:49.70]Just in case anybody was wondering, it's a cool looking blaster.
[283:54.51]It's a rocket launcher.
[283:56.97]So I would hope somebody would look up and be like, will you shut the fuck up?
[284:01.75]Huh?
[284:06.18]What?
[284:08.14]Yeah, you're being really fucking loud and like annoying everybody in like the whole neighborhood.
[284:15.54]Really?
[284:16.00]Preclusterous.
[284:22.93]Kim is not asleep, she's downstairs.
[284:29.07]Yeah, who would have thought?
[284:29.83]Who would have thought that like being wicked fucking loud without your window?
[284:34.33]Screaming at us.
[284:36.13]I'm... No.
[284:40.87]The window is open and I'm leaning outside to get some fresh air while I scream.
[284:46.17]Yeah.
[284:48.86]You just described exactly why we're annoyed by it.
[284:53.80]Fuck you, boomer.
[284:55.42]And then they keep going.
[285:05.37]Anyways, let's keep going.
[285:06.53]Let's keep building our children's toy.
[285:08.15]But we're not bothering anybody else.
[285:12.48]That was a long vroomer rant, but you knew it was coming eventually.
[285:15.00]There's only so many times you can get vroomed on stream before you fucking get annoyed by it.
[285:30.18]I added in like littering and breaking glass.
[285:32.30]It doesn't matter.
[285:32.82]It doesn't matter.
[285:34.18]Be kind to each other.
[285:35.58]Okay?
[285:36.44]That's the moral of the story.
[285:37.78]Be fucking nice to each other.
[285:38.90]Don't be like a vroomer.
[285:47.81]Being a vroomer means you're like a bad person apparently.
[286:02.55]I feel like my hair just stood on end.
[286:09.47]I'm gonna go to a goddamn town hall meeting.
[286:13.06]It's like a Las Vegas town hall.
[286:18.14]We need to do something about these fucking rumors.
[286:21.44]God damn it, I am a fucking old person now, aren't I?
[286:25.56]Anybody that threatens to go to town hall is definitely over the age of 50.
[286:32.79]The whole thing.
[286:33.43]Mm-hmm.
[286:42.96]Every fold, every line.
[286:44.68]You got it.
[286:50.22]I hear it in my sleep as if it were God.
[286:54.50]And sometimes it's not even a rumor.
[286:56.59]And I think it is.
[286:57.57]And I'm prepared for it and I get ready for it.
[287:00.43]I hear like...
[287:02.98]No, okay, no, that was just somebody like starting their car because they're going to work.
[287:06.91]Alright, I think we're all folded.
[287:25.10]It's just a fan.
[287:26.38]Alright, a fan.
[287:33.75]You're just scared of getting a job.
[287:35.07]What the fuck are you on about?
[287:43.27]Alright, next.
[287:45.91]Do you remember who doesn't have fans?
[287:54.78]I do, at least a hundred.
[288:05.65]Connect that bottom part.
[288:13.83]This is a weird piece.
[288:18.22]Okay.
[288:19.40]Like that.
[288:23.48]How long was that rumor part of the stream?
[288:27.86]I can't tell.
[288:29.02]I can't see from here.
[288:38.58]A hefty amount, like 20 minutes.
[288:41.28]Ah, sorry.
[288:43.40]Spent longer time on more dumb shit, it's okay.
[288:45.46]As long as it wasn't like 40.
[288:47.24]This is an interesting looking piece.
[288:54.97]This folds all the way in, really?
[288:57.45]Really, I don't believe you.
[288:58.79]I don't, wait.
[289:03.93]What?
[289:06.32]Fold this down.
[289:11.06]okay this comes down and then this comes up roll it over Jesus alright this these two come down I'm getting sleepy stop being so boring I was just screaming for like 10 straight minutes
[289:40.28]I was just making loud fucking noises for like 15 straight minutes.
[289:48.83]I was screaming and yelling.
[289:53.95]Loud equals funny.
[289:55.29]No, I wasn't trying to be funny.
[289:56.77]I was trying to make a point.
[289:58.09]It's alright.
[289:59.55]You can't win.
[290:00.11]You can't win.
[290:10.20]What's next?
[290:20.22]Loud equals I'm right, got it.
[290:25.18]No, that was the culmination of six months of being vroomed on and off stream.
[290:32.97]No, loud doesn't equal right, loud is not funny.
[290:39.49]God dammit.
[290:40.39]Don't think of me like that.
[290:41.49]Actually, think of me after you watch.
[290:49.96]Where is this?
[290:50.48]This is a tight piece.
[290:54.60]What are the squares on my door?
[290:57.16]They are noise dampening devices.
[291:01.95]It is noise foam.
[291:04.61]Makes it so there's no echo in the room.
[291:06.71]As you notice when I go
[291:10.89]There's no echo.
[291:12.77]There's a bunch of panels over here.
[291:13.97]There's a couple of bass traps in the corners.
[291:16.73]A couple of bass traps in the, what's it gonna say, sink?
[291:21.36]Closet?
[291:24.36]It dampens the sound in the room, so without a bunch of furniture, you can not have a bunch of echo.
[291:32.96]It's not ResidentSleeper, come on.
[291:34.54]It's 9, 10, 11, it's like 12 a.m.
[291:37.61]Of course you're gonna ResidentSleeper.
[291:40.29]It's time for bed in like 10 minutes, but I'm not stopping the stream.
[291:46.41]I got them all.
[291:49.31]That's it, right?
[291:50.25]Looks good.
[291:52.00]That little piece here.
[291:54.54]Alright.
[291:56.42]Next is this big one.
[291:58.80]Got a tab here.
[292:02.06]I'm going to bed in a few.
[292:03.02]Yeah, do your thing, you know, do whatever you want.
[292:05.69]Do your thing.
[292:06.05]Hope you have a good rest.
[292:10.24]Have a great sleep.
[292:11.54]Hope you have the best dreams possible.
[292:14.26]Define good.
[292:15.02]Have a good, I don't know, have a good restful six to eight hours of sleep.
[292:18.65]Hope you have a good restful, like, eight hours of sleep.
[292:24.79]You wake up refreshed and ready to take on the world, you know?
[292:30.53]Unless you've been drinking wine all night.
[292:33.00]In that case, then sleep in a little.
[292:34.40]I don't know.
[292:41.83]Hold all this stuff 13 hours we've been up for 13 hours before it's not that long Tell a bedtime story, um, I Don't really have a bedtime story
[293:09.98]You're better off just kind of making one up yourself.
[293:20.21]13 hour stream, I don't, that's not going to happen.
[293:24.81]This has been about five hours.
[293:26.95]Feels a lot shorter than that.
[293:31.26]This will be like seven, six to eight.
[293:35.64]I'm not doing a 13 hour stream.
[293:42.71]Alright, that's all folded.
[293:45.79]Good to go.
[293:46.65]Alright, now what?
[293:47.51]What do I do with this?
[293:56.56]Read the whole Rat Movie script?
[294:00.86]I made it.
[294:01.24]I don't need to read it.
[294:01.96]I already know all the lines.
[294:03.76]Okay, this whole thing rolls up.
[294:10.07]From this side, the thing rolls over.
[294:13.56]Like that.
[294:17.42]And then, geez, comes across the whole thing.
[294:20.80]Snaps in.
[294:26.76]Give us a goodnight kiss.
[294:30.45]Um, how about a goodnight something, you know?
[294:34.99]Hey, goodnight something.
[294:48.73]Okay, that's good.
[294:51.25]Close it!
[294:56.72]Now if you take it off, you're going to bed.
[294:58.22]I will see you again soon.
[295:00.18]Thanks for coming out.
[295:02.46]Blaster is nearing completion.
[295:04.34]It's pretty interesting.
[295:04.98]It's got like a little in the middle, so that's cool.
[295:09.11]And this tab folds out, and what does the tab do?
[295:13.41]Hidden opening and stick it in?
[295:16.25]It's that simple, apparently.
[295:21.35]Alright, then this piece, which is right and left, it's got a couple of lines here to fold.
[295:31.73]Lick us or you'll never see us again.
[295:33.39]That's not true.
[295:36.14]You're telling me if I don't lick the camera, then you guys won't come back.
[295:39.32]I have trouble believing that.
[295:42.88]Alright, let's put it all together.
[295:46.94]Ooh, any yellow?
[295:48.58]Two of them.
[295:52.59]These are thicker than the other ones.
[295:58.19]Getting almost to the end of the grommets.
[296:03.58]So we're combining these two, so this is R and R. Each bit has a hole in it and we want to line those up.
[296:16.12]First make sure that the R mark on each piece is facing upward.
[296:21.60]Well, it is now.
[296:22.90]R and R, right?
[296:28.93]So R and R, like that?
[296:36.32]I think?
[296:38.28]I don't know.
[296:43.20]Like that.
[296:50.78]I mean, that's correct.
[296:54.86]And then a yellow grommet goes in the middle here.
[296:57.92]Through all of it, or just through the middle there?
[297:00.08]Which one?
[297:04.59]So right through the middle.
[297:07.65]Like this.
[297:12.55]And then stick this on here.
[297:15.33]Click!
[297:17.69]Alright.
[297:18.89]Same thing on the other one?
[297:21.14]Whoa, shit.
[297:21.76]Alright, hold on, wait.
[297:23.42]So then this then... What?
[297:38.55]Okay.
[297:43.46]Another snap?
[297:45.18]What?
[297:45.44]There already is a snap on it.
[297:51.60]Am I doing this wrong?
[297:55.60]There's already a snap on it.
[297:59.69]This seems like it's not supposed to be the way.
[298:09.77]I guess it is.
[298:15.00]Because then this washer comes on.
[298:18.62]That's on there, right?
[298:22.15]Did it too early?
[298:25.09]I think I got it.
[298:25.85]I think that's it, right?
[298:29.01]Snap too early.
[298:30.89]Snap too early.
[298:40.34]That looks like it's on.
[298:44.57]Wait.
[299:13.92]I need to get that off.
[299:18.63]You snapped too early!
[299:21.49]Dammit, this is on there so deep, too.
[299:24.81]Look at how bad that is.
[299:25.83]That's on there so deep.
[299:29.16]I'm never gonna get that off.
[299:33.96]Oh, it's gonna take... It's gonna be impossible.
[299:44.74]No way.
[299:53.62]Oh, this is so bad.
[299:55.08]I fucked this up so bad, huh?
[300:04.05]Buy a new one!
[300:04.87]That's not gonna work.
[300:06.67]Come on, do it.
[300:08.29]Get off there, I know you can.
[300:09.87]Come on.
[300:27.60]It's on this, so good.
[300:28.52]I need to get a coin or something.
[300:31.38]I'm not... No.
[300:45.01]No, that's not a good idea.
[300:56.23]Got it.
[301:10.23]Oh, get off!
[301:11.69]It won't get off!
[301:19.48]It won't come off.
[301:23.39]Shit!
[301:58.47]Got it.
[302:04.98]Okay.
[302:07.52]Same thing on the other side.
[302:13.90]um something I'm gonna close it Jerma looks skinnier than normal what no I don't this is hard to do he's big chunky wasn't that pizza what whatever there's pizza somewhere where
[302:55.83]Done, finally.
[302:57.08]Man, I just fucked that up.
[302:58.28]My fingers hurt.
[303:01.18]Look a bit like more of something you can hold.
[303:02.74]It does.
[303:03.66]There's a hair stuck in here.
[303:11.21]Push the button.
[303:11.95]Try pushing the button.
[303:12.89]The hook-like bit should lift up.
[303:17.37]It does.
[303:20.35]Looks pretty good.
[303:25.55]Okay, this piece is up next.
[303:27.65]It's fancy armor.
[303:29.15]What did I do with that piece?
[303:38.10]Where's that?
[303:50.21]Did I take that piece out?
[303:56.27]Where is this?
[303:56.81]I didn't take that piece out.
[303:59.81]Is it this one?
[304:08.70]No, it's not that one.
[304:09.54]Where the hell is it?
[304:24.99]It's that one right there.
[304:26.41]Okay, so it's this bit.
[304:27.57]I guess I never took it out.
[304:34.96]Okay, that's it, right?
[304:36.30]Just this piece?
[304:38.50]I think so.
[304:40.69]Pretty sure.
[304:41.11]We're almost done.
[304:43.75]We're getting there.
[304:46.75]Please feed me, I'm starving.
[304:48.11]I have no ability to do that.
[305:04.50]Almost.
[305:05.00]Almost.
[305:09.08]Feed us ads.
[305:11.90]No, you... Look, it's getting late.
[305:17.16]It's like 12.30 Eastern.
[305:20.80]We gotta finish this.
[305:24.90]Alright, we need the sticker sheet again.
[305:26.10]These last two right on both dots right here.
[305:38.49]Right on top.
[305:43.44]And same thing.
[305:45.32]Carve the mark.
[305:53.01]No bedtime stories.
[305:55.87]Just type in scary stories into your Google search.
[305:58.55]You'll find something interesting.
[305:59.79]I guarantee it.
[306:05.15]I don't want any fucking ads.
[306:07.25]You bastards.
[306:08.37]The normal stream is already just a long... What did that say?
[306:17.05]The normal stream is just a long ad.
[306:25.52]This is not an ad.
[306:28.72]An ad?
[306:30.82]No, if it were an ad, they would have sponsored Labo in the title.
[306:38.20]Okay, move that.
[306:42.38]We're getting real close to being able to go... Fold lines!
[306:46.85]You got it.
[306:47.31]All of them.
[306:53.47]I wanna go swimming!
[306:59.26]Really bad!
[307:09.40]Like right now.
[307:11.48]Oh well.
[307:12.94]I'll take a bath.
[307:31.13]Is he drunk?
[307:33.21]Um, not as much as I was during the VR stream.
[307:38.44]I'm like a solid 6 out of 10 right now for inebriation, I would say.
[307:49.29]Did it all?
[307:49.89]Come on.
[307:53.89]Okay, this is important.
[308:02.49]So this goes here.
[308:09.52]like that and this folds up I get this I guess do you see a semicircle yes I do but dude this is like what the hell are you talking about oh that was a hiccup so you're going to insert the grip now wait wait wait wait wait wait wait go back
[308:42.60]this just comes up and then this goes in here like that in all the way alright so it's in all the way all the way up to the this little slot here and it pushes down whoa whoa you're going too fast
[309:28.37]So this goes down in here into these slots, but they don't really stand that well.
[309:33.53]And the whole back comes up over the whole thing.

[317:16.18]What are the two tabs for?
[317:20.35]See these little tabs here?
[317:22.83]They should slot into the openings too.
[317:24.49]You can do them at once or one by one.
[317:54.52]I think we're good.
[317:58.70]They're not in though.
[318:03.24]See what I'm saying?
[318:03.88]They like keep popping out.
[318:11.37]That's as good as it's gonna get.

[318:16.78]I mean, it's a four hour project.
[318:19.20]This takes four hours.
[318:21.54]This is not like 10 minutes.

[329:19.22]Still a lot left in here.
[329:31.99]Mmm.
[329:33.75]Alright, thank you for your patience.
[329:37.91]I appreciate it.
[329:40.05]She was making food and it was just done.
[329:42.11]And it looked... I had to eat it.
[329:45.27]I had to.
[329:47.43]There was no getting around that one.
[329:50.51]Alright, so... God damn it, I got, like, fucking salmon oil, salmon grease all over this.
[329:56.72]Sorry, it's just one piece.
[330:01.06]So we're at the left side.
[330:02.38]Oh, this looks bad.
[330:10.05]Oh, let's just punch him up.
[330:19.20]Don't forget to hydrate.
[330:20.22]No, I didn't.
[330:22.30]I had a glass of water downstairs.
[330:25.36]Do not worry about me.
[330:28.03]Got a glass of water.
[330:28.87]I've been drinking water all night.
[330:32.09]That was so good, though.
[330:33.09]Holy shit.
[330:34.21]I'm so satisfied.
[330:35.83]Alright, let's fold.
[330:41.28]We're almost done.
[330:42.12]We're getting close to the end.
[330:45.60]If you could say I was there the whole time and all I got was this lousy stream.
[330:56.02]Wait, what?
[330:59.25]Oh shit, I do have to fold these.
[331:03.75]Homestretch!
[331:05.05]Only one more part.
[331:07.27]We're so close to you not being able to enjoy the virtual reality portion of the stream.
[331:14.16]That's okay though.
[331:17.26]It's alright.
[331:18.55]The journey is what mattered, not the friends along the way.
[331:21.91]It was the journey there.
[331:22.83]No, no, no.
[331:24.35]It was the friends along the way, not whatever it was.
[331:28.19]You know how that goes.
[331:36.32]Couple more pieces.
[331:37.36]There's only one.
[331:38.18]No, there's no more.
[331:41.09]There's like three or four more pieces left, and that's it.
[331:46.23]Can you wash your hands?
[331:48.85]What?
[331:51.03]No, no, this is from when it first came in the room.
[331:55.79]That's not from right now.
[331:57.88]That's from my panic.
[332:02.14]Realizing how good it looked.
[332:13.59]It's kind of greasy, but whatever.
[332:16.60]I never said it wasn't going to be not greasy.
[332:18.51]I just told you it was going to be done.
[332:19.77]Alright.
[332:22.55]What does this do now?
[332:23.83]Am I a good cook?
[332:32.39]No.
[332:32.94]Kim is.
[332:34.58]Kim is a great cook.
[332:36.08]I am not.
[332:38.10]I just enjoy her wonderful fucking food that she makes all the time.
[332:42.50]So...
[332:44.91]I am spoiled in that regard for sure.
[332:47.81]She makes great food.
[332:50.83]What am I doing with this?
[332:54.81]Oh God, now what?
[332:59.29]How does this go in?
[333:00.18]Attaching these two big bits might be tricky.
[333:04.78]Take a good look and make sure everything's facing the same way.
[333:10.78]Right down here.
[333:15.62]Okay.
[333:20.55]It folds down the whole way.
[333:22.73]Oh, God.
[333:30.81]It's in there.
[333:36.77]We're down.
[333:38.75]There's this piece folded up.
[333:41.31]Okay.
[333:52.33]Then where do I go with this?
[333:54.89]Hold on.
[333:58.27]Is this right?
[333:59.97]I think so.
[334:05.07]Slide the jaw into place.
[334:06.91]Right through the middle.
[334:19.30]That's in.
[334:24.78]Move this through and stick it in to keep it secure.
[334:29.76]Good!
[334:35.80]Finally time to attach the grip to the rest of the toy cone.
[334:43.08]This all folds out.

[337:41.33]It should look like this.
[337:49.25]It does not look like that.
[337:51.39]Now it does.
[337:52.03]That's in.
[337:55.96]Same thing on the other side.

[343:38.64]So what does this stick on?
[343:45.66]So this is the holder for the Joy-Con.
[343:57.32]Alright.
[344:00.22]Lots of folds.
[344:01.48]That's what you came here for.
[344:02.84]That's why you're here.
[344:04.93]To watch a guy fold cardboard.
[344:08.35]That's exactly what you're getting.
[344:11.83]No ifs, ands, or buts here.
[344:14.57]You're just getting a guy fucking folding cardboard.
[344:17.61]And drinking wine while he does it.
[344:19.09]That's pretty much all that's here.
[344:24.21]Couple of rumors.
[344:26.50]Yeah.
[344:29.10]Only a few broomers, that's it though.

[350:14.90]Through there and then all the way down.
[350:17.61]And that's in.
[350:22.65]And then close it up, both sides.
[350:29.17]Get in there.
[350:38.34]So this is like a little antenna.
[350:45.96]Is that, could that be everything?
[350:47.62]Er, try to contain your excitement while we do some important checks.
[350:52.16]Is the hold with the Joy-Con only rotation, should only rotate 90 degrees?
[350:57.63]90 degrees, that's it.
[351:05.77]No more than that.
[351:11.97]Got it.
[351:15.20]A few more hand checks now.
[351:18.66]Hold the grip with whichever hand is more comfortable, and then cock it, right?
[351:27.81]Pull the sticky out-y bit back to your click, then push the button.
[351:33.27]That's how you fire the blaster.
[351:35.09]What button?
[351:39.36]What?
[351:57.69]Wow.
[352:02.71]That's actually really cool.
[352:07.31]Damn.
[352:07.91]Well, alright.
[352:11.06]Yeah, what is this sorcery?
[352:13.10]I agree, that's fucking insane.
[352:19.20]If you build everything properly, the clicker should make a nice noise.
[352:21.94]It does.
[352:24.43]Could it be that is the blaster done?
[352:25.73]No, not quite.
[352:26.75]Just a bit more and you can finally play with the blaster.
[352:28.53]That might be a good tactic, a good glass of wine.
[352:35.55]Alright, one more stop.
[352:38.39]This is it, guys, I'm done.
[352:41.07]It's over.
[352:42.59]I'm gonna play.
[352:43.83]I'm gonna tell you how fun it is.
[352:45.03]Uh-oh, guys, I'm sorry, that's it.
[352:52.30]It's time for you to be turned off.
[353:05.27]Okay.
[353:08.55]Get the Joy-Con left and right ready.
[353:14.15]This is the song you've been listening to the whole time.
[353:18.79]So Joy-Con R goes in the front.
[353:31.14]Holy shit, okay, so it goes in here.
[353:36.41]It's in there.
[353:36.91]Now what?
[353:49.30]The bump on the back of the what?
[353:54.02]Should rest nicely in the opening, it does.
[353:58.96]Joy-Con left goes in here.
[354:02.68]Just kind of slides in this part.
[354:09.93]That's in.
[354:17.64]Now... I need the goggles, right?
[354:22.16]Let's do a quick check from this side.
[354:23.88]Can you see the bump on the back of the controller poking through here?
[354:31.35]Poking through where?
[354:37.27]I can see it, yeah.
[354:39.19]I can see the green.
[354:44.18]Now, open the cover so that we can insert the VR goggles.
[354:53.36]Oh.
[354:58.38]Oh, fuck.
[354:58.92]I need these.
[354:59.84]Okay.
[355:01.44]This is going to be like a submarine.
[355:09.79]What?
[355:26.00]You actually have to do this.
[355:27.58]This is ridiculous.
[355:28.74]Okay, so that's in.
[355:29.60]What about the safety thing?
[355:37.08]Raise the cover to hold the VR goggles.
[355:38.83]Okay, so go like this.
[355:41.49]So that's in.
[355:53.58]No, I don't want to take it out.
[355:58.33]That's it!
[356:14.72]I did it!
[356:19.10]Now I'm gonna play while you guys just watch me look like a dickhead on camera.
[356:28.63]How do I do this?
[356:31.51]Wait, doesn't this... Insert the console into the goggles.
[356:40.76]How?
[356:41.82]What?
[356:44.24]Oh shit, hold on.
[356:47.30]This has gotta go in here.
[357:00.67]I don't even care.
[357:02.41]I spent five hours, six hours making this.
[357:05.80]I'm gonna get the fruits of my labor right now.
[357:07.40]It's in?
[357:08.52]It's locked in.
[357:09.44]Here we go.
[357:17.67]Attach the VR goggles and the Joy-Con.
[357:19.29]They're in there.
[357:20.17]Push the button to start.
[357:21.35]What button?
[357:27.21]What the fuck?
[357:28.01]This is crazy looking.
[357:30.37]downtown defense guys if I could only describe to you how cool this was
[357:59.37]This has to be like 480p.
[358:02.95]There's no way this is more than 720p.
[358:07.66]This is like 520p.
[358:08.72]I can't even see what's going on.
[358:17.17]And it hurts my face.
[358:31.93]I did it!
[358:39.04]Yeah, the resolution is very low.
[358:42.64]This is pretty cool though.
[358:43.72]If I was 8, I mean if I was like 18, if I was like 28, this is still cool.
[358:51.19]Like, I made this.
[359:27.00]I wonder if I can just put this on the screen.
[359:30.22]Can you hear the sounds?
[359:32.38]I mean, it's cool.
[359:34.49]Defeat all enemies within one minute.
[359:36.17]You got it.
[360:03.44]That guy did a pretty good job.
[360:09.58]His little knees.
[360:22.12]This is cool.
[360:28.29]Take regular breaks.
[360:30.17]Get out of here.
[360:30.63]Don't tell me what to do, Nintendo.
[360:49.72]Look at how cool that looks.
[360:52.35]You're in it.
[360:52.81]Dude, you're in it right now.
[360:53.68]You're in it.
[361:25.81]It's your turn.
[361:27.30]I can't.
[361:31.98]There's no way for me.
[361:33.41]I can't do that.
[361:55.88]I'll show you.
[361:56.32]I'll show you.
[361:56.80]Relax, relax.
[361:57.44]I'll show you.
[362:07.89]You have Blaster in the middle.
[362:10.41]And you shoot, shoot, shoot.
[362:14.01]It's great.
[362:15.87]It's not that great.
[362:17.57]It's kind of great.
[362:27.76]We aim around... Kinda dumb, actually.
[362:37.95]This thing is awesome.
[362:39.61]This is cool.
[362:41.31]I love this thing.
[362:42.01]The fact that it makes the actual shooting sounds...
[362:55.05]I wonder, can you see this if I put it back in here?
[362:57.42]I don't think you can.
[363:07.09]No.
[363:09.37]This little gun, though, this is awesome.
[363:15.54]I'm going to hold onto this.
[363:20.78]Well, there you go.
[363:22.20]There's six hours of making a Labo.
[363:28.16]It's only like 1-2 a.m.
[363:29.30]There you go.
[363:38.32]The finest build you could ever see.
[363:41.63]The craftsmanship was there.
[363:45.59]It's too bad I couldn't mirror it so you guys could see what the hell I was doing.
[363:50.42]You forgot the pose.
[363:57.65]There.
[364:05.17]Wrong one.
[364:05.89]What are you talking about?
[364:15.07]The kid?
[364:17.10]The cartridge?
[364:21.95]What are you talking about?
[364:24.65]The pose.
[364:26.77]Oh, oh, alright.
[364:39.79]I thought you guys were talking about, dude, like a cool, you gotta missile launcher pose.
[364:45.93]Oh, fuck.
[364:46.67]Alright, how is it like this?
[364:52.99]I gotta get the whole thing.
[365:24.86]Right?
[365:49.91]Like that?
[366:13.20]Show the mouth.
[366:14.56]I can't show the mouth.
[366:31.17]Is that good?
[366:31.67]Alright, you're done.
[366:36.91]You're done.
[366:44.63]Alright!
[366:46.78]Boom!
[366:49.60]Too bad I don't have the other ones.
[366:53.82]Looks like a smelling device.
[366:59.70]I gotta find it.
[367:00.28]I don't know where the TNT is.
[367:16.30]What's going on?
[367:16.70]Oh, the camera, right?
[367:17.34]Okay, let me move this.
[367:18.05]Give me one second.
[367:18.81]I'm going to move this out of the way.
[367:23.59]I wasn't lying.
[367:24.13]I have two different socks on.
[367:26.66]Who cares?
[367:27.08]Give me one second.
[368:00.75]No leg day?
[368:01.83]I haven't been to the gym in like fucking two years.
[368:03.67]What are you talking about?
[368:07.35]Show auto, auto, no!
[368:09.72]No!
[368:20.17]No auto!
[368:20.95]Alright.
[368:33.68]Let's hang out.
[368:36.38]I wish I could show you more Labo, but that's really all there is.
[368:41.06]Hair is a little screwed up, but it could be worse.
[368:49.14]If you Google image a child eating salmon dinner, you're the first result.
[368:59.76]If only that were the case.
[369:02.00]If only.
[369:06.18]Alright, let's move some of this out of the way.
[369:09.12]We'll hang out.
[369:09.58]We'll do the bits.
[369:12.82]Close this out.
[369:15.02]That was really fun, though.
[369:15.80]That was cool.
[369:18.22]I just can't really show you how cool it is unless you were here and your head was inside the headset.
[369:28.58]Okay, let's move this.
[369:29.70]This has to go over here.
[369:37.33]Alright, there we go.
[369:39.17]Let's take up the whole space.
[369:48.72]Can I scream?
[369:49.68]I don't want to scream really loud, no thanks.
[369:51.86]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[369:55.80]What happens if the rubber band snaps in the blaster?
[370:00.83]Gonna have to make a new one.
[370:01.81]Gonna have to buy another one.
[370:06.19]I found your old demo reel.
[370:07.45]You still looking for a job?
[370:08.61]No, not anymore.
[370:11.44]Alright, let's get the bits.
[370:15.64]That took us about six and a half hours.
[370:17.32]Oh, should we just relax for a little bit?
[370:24.04]Wine can?
[370:26.88]There's still plenty left.

[371:37.38]Oh, the lighting seems weird in here.
[371:40.52]Doesn't it?
[371:40.80]Don't you think?
[371:49.01]What are my plans for the future?
[371:50.23]I don't have any plans.
[371:54.11]I don't have very many plans.
[371:57.97]Color correct it.
[371:58.65]Let's actually go into it and just move it around a little.
[372:05.75]Why can I not... There it is.
[372:07.31]Jesus.
[372:12.13]Auto fucking white balance is on.
[372:13.69]Get out of here.
[372:16.93]Whoa!
[372:18.83]Oh!
[372:20.46]No, no, no, no.
[372:21.76]No, no, no, no.
[372:22.82]Not... Okay.
[372:24.58]That looks better.
[372:27.10]Not by very much, but it does.
[372:28.14]Let's put the contrast up.
[372:41.56]I gotta make this smaller.
[372:42.94]It looks better.
[372:48.05]Uh, this needs to be lowered a lot.
[372:57.41]Hey, look!
[372:57.83]It's my room!
[372:59.89]That's a wide angle of the room, too.
[373:03.05]Sweat check?
[373:04.57]Empty.
[373:05.29]Completely fine.
[373:06.90]It's been six, almost six and a half hours.
[373:08.44]We're good to go.
[373:12.01]Let's lower this a little.
[373:16.32]Ah, whatever.
[373:16.74]I don't fucking... I really don't care.
[373:19.82]Ah, who cares?
[373:20.44]Whatever.
[373:21.68]I'll just sit up.
[373:28.34]What shade of lipstick is this?
[373:29.62]This is called Midnight Red.
[373:33.63]See?
[373:35.85]Alright, let's go back into the bits.
[373:38.57]Hope you had fun.
[373:41.75]I did.
[373:42.63]It was blessed, as always.
[373:44.35]Playing the Labo, it's a lot of fun.
[373:47.07]Is this a Logitech C920?
[373:49.07]It is.
[373:49.33]And that's a C922.
[373:57.20]So the plan is to stream tomorrow.
[374:00.74]Let's hope I get up.
[374:09.78]Yeah, we're good.
[374:11.78]I'm not chugging wine.
[374:12.86]What are you talking about?
[374:21.52]Alright.
[374:22.12]Yeah, this thing's been loved.
[374:25.02]Look at it.
[374:27.34]It's a pretty big bottle.
[374:31.36]There's probably like one more glass in here.
[374:34.98]Just about.
[374:37.70]He thought about it.
[374:40.41]For a second.
[374:43.27]Ditch the glass, you don't have to pretend.
[374:44.85]Why would I drink it out of the bottle?
[374:46.75]It's got an air rate.
[374:48.86]Alright, so six and a half hours ago we had... Don't stop streaming till the bottle's done.
[374:56.48]Then I'll see you on fucking like Monday or Tuesday.
[374:59.93]I'll see you on like Tuesday, if that's the case.
[375:06.25]Uh, what?
[375:07.15]Dreams?
[375:09.03]Uh, dreams will come back next week.
[375:15.74]I've been trying to work on it.
[375:23.60]Have you done the Dreams tutorials?
[375:28.97]That's the answer there.
[375:29.83]That's your answer.
[375:33.35]Dreams seems a lot like Labo.
[375:34.95]It is.
[375:36.09]In a way.
[375:39.05]I look drunk.
[375:42.69]How do I improve my image?
[375:50.63]Alright, there we go.
[375:51.55]No, that looks worse.
[375:54.99]You just look greasy.
[375:56.26]I've been sitting here for like six and a half hours.
[375:58.48]No, I gotta go like this.
[376:05.76]Let's, hold on.
[376:08.80]There we go.
[376:09.48]Hey, we got good lighting now.
[376:13.06]Alright, let's go through the bits.
[376:20.98]Answer your question.
[376:28.24]We had $5 from Mr. Comcast earlier this afternoon.
[376:36.07]Check the closet.
[376:36.63]There's nobody in there.
[376:37.93]There's nobody in that closet.
[376:39.47]I can assure you there's nobody in there.
[376:41.35]I promise you no one's in that closet.
[376:46.08]What is this?
[377:12.90]Okay, I just opened up a tab of that kid, the Labo Blaster, and I thought it was me.
[377:20.30]It's not.
[377:22.12]It's not.
[377:26.28]There's nobody in the fucking closet.
[377:30.65]It's just trash.
[377:32.77]There's nothing in there.
[377:34.57]See?
[377:39.17]There's nobody in there.
[377:45.60]Anyways.
[377:49.50]Uh, thank you to Mr. Comcast for the five dollars.
[377:51.78]Hey, Jerma John, Comcast here.
[377:54.12]Just letting you know that I broke my arm while trying to climb over the fence to your back garden.
[377:58.10]So now I have to wear a Comcast.
[378:02.18]Haha.
[378:03.12]Just a little humor for you there.
[378:05.06]Anyway, just stopping by to let you know that we here at Comcast are getting together a pro Fortnite team to boost our sales and we'd love to have you on it.
[378:13.19]We know how much you love getting that Victory Royale
[378:16.88]I don't see how much you love being mean to kids.
[378:21.98]Call us.
[378:22.34]We're waiting.
[378:27.52]I'm not mean to kids.
[378:30.47]I'm not.
[378:32.31]I am not mean to kids.
[378:36.81]Kids are great.
[378:39.97]Thank you, Mr. Comcast, for the $5.
[378:41.39]Thank you, Schwartz.
[378:43.99]Schwartz Ed for the $4.
[378:45.53]They say L.
[378:48.39]Ella's in like a loss, like I lost something.
[378:52.83]Thank you for the $4 regardless, Mr. Schwartz.
[378:57.61]Mr. Schwartz.
[379:05.03]You asked for it all night.
[379:14.58]There, you see?
[379:15.54]There's the dog.
[379:17.06]Mr. Otto.
[379:19.52]He's so sleepy.
[379:21.30]See, you guys woke him up to do this shit.
[379:23.50]No, he was already awake.
[379:24.62]Oh.
[379:26.00]Well, there you go.
[379:26.48]There's Otto.
[379:27.79]Hello.
[379:29.81]Look at how tired he is.
[379:30.91]Okay, put him to bed.
[379:33.59]He belongs in bed.
[379:35.69]He's like shedding.
[379:37.58]Okay, goodnight, Otto.
[379:38.64]I'll see you soon.
[379:40.78]He's just like...
[379:45.84]That dog.
[379:47.28]Dogs are like babies.
[379:48.24]You know what I mean?
[379:49.48]Just like... That was Kim.
[379:57.98]Yeah.
[380:01.66]He's too perfect for this world.
[380:03.20]He is fantastic.
[380:03.95]He's so good.
[380:05.45]He really is.
[380:06.15]He's like the best dog ever.
[380:07.85]He is eight.
[380:09.29]He is eight years old.
[380:10.33]He's fantastic.
[380:11.03]I love him.
[380:14.82]Imitate a baby being picked up.
[380:16.26]I just did.
[380:20.10]But we had... $2.50 from Devakitty.
[380:26.12]Hey, remember your old-ass dream where you were playing Layers of Fear and you should totally play an actual scary game?
[380:32.50]Any plans to play Amnesia?
[380:33.78]Another really spooky but good mod for it's called Amnesia White Knight.
[380:38.80]Anyway, hope you enjoyed.
[380:39.72]Labo Wineboy.
[380:42.13]Wineboy.
[380:44.92]Um, the last horror game we did was Dread Halls.
[380:48.04]And I can't really say that I have plans to do anything else.
[380:54.80]They just kind of happen.
[380:57.21]They just kind of happen.
[380:59.59]I don't plan it.
[381:02.17]If I feel like playing a horror game, then we'll play a horror game, right?
[381:06.27]I don't have, like, a plan to do it, you know?
[381:11.75]There's no real plans.
[381:15.07]Layers of Fear 2 is, yeah, when is that coming out?
[381:18.28]When's Layers of Fear 2?
[381:24.30]Is that like a thing?
[381:31.16]The Shrek game.
[381:32.90]I can't wait to play Shrek 2.
[381:37.58]But thank you, Devakitty.
[381:39.24]Mr. Comcast is back again with five more dollars.
[381:44.88]Hey, Jerma John Comcast here again.
[381:46.80]Just letting you know that we sadly had to disband our pro Fortnite team due to us being banned from every major esports event.
[381:56.03]So anyway, we noticed that you had a fuckload of wine.
[381:58.93]So since you're drunk, now's probably the best time to ask, will you be coming to my 415th birthday party?
[382:05.74]If you're wondering how old I am or how I'm so old, because every evil corporation CEO is immortal.
[382:12.55]You're going to make me die.
[382:14.59]We need a clown to perform.
[382:15.91]You'd be perfect.
[382:18.45]Okay.
[382:18.83]Alright.
[382:19.29]You got to the point there.
[382:24.00]I'm going to have to respectfully decline your offer to come be a clown.
[382:28.14]Thank you, though.
[382:28.62]Appreciate it.
[382:33.58]clown makeup tutorial.
[382:35.54]I don't have a clown makeup tutorial for you.
[382:38.01]Just put makeup all over your face and go like this with red.
[382:42.77]And then do like orange here.
[382:45.77]And then laugh and scream at people.
[382:51.02]But thank you, Mr. Comcast.
[382:52.08]Thank you, Jess.
[382:52.68]You got it for the 250.
[382:53.78]Jerm finally finished that painting.
[382:56.42]Thanks for being such an inspiration on more ways than one.
[382:59.72]Jerm of Heart.
[383:00.12]Let's see it.
[383:00.46]Let's take a look.
[383:03.85]This is fuckin' awesome, hold on.
[383:05.09]Where'd it go?
[383:13.47]Viva Las Vegas, baby!
[383:15.81]Let's put it on screen.
[383:17.51]This is from Jess, you got it.
[383:22.66]The next big stream will be soon.
[383:28.34]This is a high resolution.
[383:44.12]Elvis, the real Elvis.
[383:47.80]This is awesome.
[383:49.44]Thank you so much.
[383:50.64]This is fucking amazing.
[383:53.30]Viva Las Vegas, baby.
[383:58.51]Great job.
[384:05.85]Great fucking job.
[384:06.85]Thank you so much.
[384:13.21]That was from... Ow.
[384:16.91]Nice album cover.
[384:19.43]It just looks great.
[384:21.41]It just looks great.
[384:22.67]That's all there is to it.
[384:23.39]That was from Jess You Got It.
[384:28.19]Thank you.
[384:30.81]That was great.
[384:31.41]It looked fantastic.
[384:33.21]The lights and the lighting work and the color work.
[384:36.84]Somebody said the cape looked amazing.
[384:39.46]Yeah.
[384:40.48]There's some talented motherfuckers here.
[384:43.17]I don't mean that term like that.
[384:44.27]Like, oh, motherfuckers.
[384:51.02]Huh?
[384:53.68]What?
[385:02.58]Oh, it can't be.
[385:03.68]It can't be the end of the line.
[385:10.49]Took a week to finish it.
[385:12.51]I've been drinking it for like six hours.
[385:15.32]I'm not even sweating either.
[385:16.36]This is like a non-sweat wine.
[385:17.84]This is a big deal.
[385:19.98]This is actually a big fucking deal.
[385:21.66]I am not sweating at all.
[385:22.66]I'm going to have to remember this brand.
[385:25.01]This is a no-sweat brand.
[385:31.37]But thank you, Jess.
[385:31.95]You got it.
[385:32.33]Thank you for that amazing painting.
[385:36.48]Picture.
[385:37.34]Looks great.
[385:40.89]Uh, Deadly SP, thanks for $5.
[385:44.07]When the next Labo comes out, you should stream it in a vineyard in Napa Valley.
[385:48.25]Just 12 hours of you getting shitfaced with an endless supply of fancy red and overpriced cardboard in Sully, California.
[385:56.06]Sully and Chet, Shelly, California.
[385:59.72]The original thing I thought would be funny was to do this on a mountain.
[386:05.20]To stream the Labo VR on a mountain and just try to build it, but the wind...
[386:12.64]made that impossible.
[386:13.74]There's no way.
[386:14.82]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[386:17.76]In the pre-stream chat, like two weeks ago, we talked about me doing a Labo on a mountain.
[386:26.64]No, it was impossible.
[386:28.04]It's too windy.
[386:30.56]It would never fucking work, unfortunately.
[386:39.05]Although there are some, like, calm places.
[386:45.54]Imagine just like, let me do this piece now.
[386:49.67]It's six hours of that.
[386:50.95]It would take like two days.
[386:56.03]I can't wait to get in that dunk tank.
[386:57.19]It's going to be fucking so much fun.
[387:02.34]You guys have no idea how much I'm looking forward to that stream.
[387:05.32]It's going to be fucking so fun.
[387:08.88]Camping stream.
[387:10.07]No, no, I don't camp.
[387:11.63]I suck at it.
[387:13.77]Hey, Sayus, or Saus, thanks for the $10, Saus.
[387:18.75]This will be the first and last time I donate.
[387:20.89]I appreciate you so much.
[387:22.11]Thank you.
[387:23.71]Well, thanks for the fucking $10.
[387:25.39]Thanks for the incredibly generous fucking donation.
[387:29.54]$10 is more than enough money I could ever assume anyone would ever give somebody on the internet, so thank you.
[387:36.98]I really appreciate that.
[387:39.30]Much love to you.
[387:39.94]Thanks for the $10.
[387:42.44]Kel Dose, thanks for the 350.
[387:44.32]Jerm Boy, just wanted to say that you always make my boring and sad days a bit better.
[387:50.04]You're the only one that can make me laugh with your stupid jokes and boomer ramblings.
[387:54.24]And for that, I thank you very, very much.
[387:56.00]Jerma One Guy.
[387:57.40]Jerma Heart PS.
[387:59.61]You stink, please wash.
[388:00.93]No, I don't think so.
[388:02.69]Not today.
[388:04.45]Not today.
[388:06.83]Not both arms.
[388:07.91]I'll show you both.
[388:09.03]We're good.
[388:10.05]We are so good right now.
[388:17.55]But Keldos, I'm fucking happy that you can hang out here.
[388:24.82]I'm shocked all the time that people think it's fun to watch some dickhead drink wine for six hours and play with a kid's cardboard toy.
[388:35.84]We go back and forth.
[388:36.78]We have fun.
[388:37.58]I'm just glad that you enjoy it.
[388:39.61]It's a blast for me.
[388:41.69]So I hope you have fun too.
[388:45.09]I am so happy that you have fun and we both have fun at the same time.
[388:50.77]If it wasn't fun, I wouldn't be doing it.
[388:52.21]Let's just put it that way.
[388:53.65]For real.
[389:01.15]Thank you.
[389:03.59]Thank you, Keldos.
[389:06.06]Then we had five community subs from Dr. Steen.
[389:09.48]Thank you, Dr. Steen, again, for your five community subs.
[389:13.00]If it's not fun, why bother?
[389:14.43]Thank you.
[389:15.05]That's exactly why.
[389:17.93]If I'm not having a good time, then... What, am I going to pretend to have a good time?
[389:23.85]That's not going to happen.
[389:27.19]Maybe, like, pretend to have a good time for six hours.
[389:29.66]What?
[389:30.00]Like, that's not going to happen.
[389:37.28]Uh, Rare Pepe Body Lotion.
[389:40.64]Thank you, Rare Pepe Body Lotion, for the 10 bucks.
[389:43.76]What happened when you went to the dentist today?
[389:47.65]He replaced them all.
[389:49.35]All these.
[389:50.65]See?
[389:51.63]All new.
[389:54.09]All the way back.
[389:54.55]These are all new teeth.
[390:00.31]I just had him pull out.
[390:01.77]He pulled them out and put them back in.
[390:09.61]But thank you.
[390:10.51]Rare Pepe Body Lotion.
[390:11.87]That's an interesting name.
[390:18.75]Rare Pepe Body Lotion.
[390:24.15]What's this?
[390:30.18]In my mouth.
[390:31.10]Remember, dentist is fucking in my mouth.
[390:34.62]Like, dentist is in my mouth doing these things.
[390:37.76]Get rid of it.
[390:39.90]Remember, Dentist is fucking... That, if you weren't there, at the very, very end of the last stream two days ago, I forgot to turn the stream off.
[390:58.03]And I was watching the same clip like four, five, six times in a row.
[391:08.40]Just needed to know.
[391:09.10]Just needed to know.
[391:11.54]Ah, but Kimchi W, thanks for the eeeeee bits!
[391:17.63]Uh, this week your streams have been my lifesaver after smoking the devil's lettuce almost every day for the past six years.
[391:23.07]Come to the realization that I was addicted.
[391:24.63]Now I'm on my fourth day clean.
[391:27.32]Your streams have really helped distract me and keep me laughing.
[391:29.56]P.S.
[391:30.66]Can I get some jermaHearts in chat for support?
[391:36.32]Yeah, I mean, whatever road that you decide to take.
[391:42.73]You just take care of yourself, you know?
[391:50.12]Good that you kind of saw that you had an issue there and you made some steps to correct it.
[391:55.96]That's all you can do.
[391:58.68]It's just a series of trying to figure out what you can do and trying to do it.
[392:04.41]That's really, that's pretty much life, man.
[392:07.94]I'm really, really happy that you can kind of make those steps to go in the direction that you think is the right direction.
[392:13.80]So, good luck to you.
[392:16.48]Much love to you.
[392:18.08]Hang in there.
[392:20.42]Keep going.
[392:25.60]I'm happy to be somebody that you can watch and laugh to in this community of hilarious fucking people.
[392:32.56]Figure out what you need to do and do it.
[392:34.50]Jerma985.
[392:35.42]I mean, that's not a quote.
[392:36.90]That's just
[392:39.15]If you can figure out what you need to do to make your life better, then do it.
[392:44.81]Just do it.
[392:46.67]That's the best advice that anybody could ever give.
[392:50.91]Do and do it, everyone.
[392:53.95]You heard the man.
[392:54.85]Do it.
[392:57.50]No, but it's true.
[392:59.62]Everybody has their own path.
[393:00.90]Everybody has their own stuff that they're working on, that they're doing.
[393:05.73]And no two people are the same.
[393:08.67]So it's hard to... You know, everyone's so different.
[393:13.81]Yesterday, you said tomorrow.
[393:15.67]So just do it!
[393:19.87]Wow, what a statement.
[393:25.85]No, but yeah, that's really... Everybody's got their own shit to deal with.
[393:30.55]Everybody's got their own path.
[393:32.61]Find yours.
[393:34.76]Now you can claw that shit!
[393:38.24]What am I fighting Joel?
[393:39.26]It's already done!
[393:52.64]Say something, how can you say something so brave?
[394:02.46]Be careful.
[394:03.02]You might punch yourself.
[394:08.97]Oh, what is it?
[394:09.43]Oh, wait.
[394:10.09]What the fuck?
[394:11.41]Mosquito's up tonight?
[394:12.49]What's going on here?
[394:20.75]Uh, but hey.
[394:22.98]Uh, Zach or Zake.
[394:25.02]Thank you, Zachy or Zachy.
[394:27.12]Zake.
[394:28.00]Z-A-K-K-E for the five bucks.
[394:30.71]Hey, Jeremy, cheers from Finland!
[394:33.35]Hello from America.
[394:35.53]I was once on a cruise ship to Sweden.
[394:38.01]I took a huge shit in my cabin bathroom, but the toilet didn't flush after multiple tries.
[394:44.72]I didn't know what to do, so I found a cleaning lady.
[394:47.12]She didn't speak any Finnish or English.
[394:49.36]So I took her to the bathroom.
[394:51.10]I pointed at it and said, look in Swedish, and pressed the toilet button.
[394:55.72]The toilet flushed perfectly.
[395:03.25]Did this really happen?
[395:06.65]That's- oh, that's a coffee pasta.
[395:20.44]I don't know shit, guys.
[395:21.80]I don't.
[395:22.26]I really don't.
[395:26.39]I don't know any of these!
[395:27.91]I don't have time to fucking know every meme!
[395:37.88]Thank you, Zake, for the $5, though.
[395:40.30]Jerma lied about Ace Attorney.
[395:41.86]He didn't lie.
[395:42.54]He told the truth.
[395:43.38]He tried to be as transparent as he could with talking about how he wasn't sure if he wanted to play the game at all and it wasn't for him.
[395:49.02]He didn't lie about it, though.
[395:50.72]He did tell you he wasn't, maybe not going to play it, though.
[395:55.82]Hey, Mr. Squishy, thanks for the $2.50.
[395:57.60]Kim wants to know if you want pizza and if you took the extension cord.
[396:13.02]Yeah, I did.
[396:18.58]I had to put the camera in.
[396:20.71]Ah, thank you, Mr. Squishy.
[396:21.99]I'll take salmon.
[396:22.65]Salmon sounds pretty good tonight.
[396:24.69]That was fucking amazing.
[396:26.07]Ah, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[396:28.05]May the 4th be with you, by the way.
[396:29.71]Nice bulge.
[396:30.55]Hey, thanks.
[396:32.71]Is it the May 4th?
[396:33.57]It is May 4th.
[396:37.79]I'm getting off the internet.
[396:41.19]You guys thought I was streaming tomorrow?
[396:42.65]I'm not going to be anywhere near the internet on May 4th.
[396:56.30]It's too late.
[396:57.94]Maybe too late for you.
[396:59.92]Not too late for me.
[397:02.60]It's May 5th tomorrow.
[397:03.70]Yeah, I know.
[397:07.16]Lower.
[397:07.46]What do you mean I don't know what day it is?
[397:09.86]Wait.
[397:13.72]It's May 4th right now.
[397:19.16]It's Cinco de Mayo tomorrow.
[397:21.28]What?
[397:23.92]I'm getting off.
[397:24.40]I'm not going out of the internet.
[397:25.44]I'm not fucking going anywhere.
[397:27.10]I'm blocking myself.
[397:27.94]I'm going to sleep all day tomorrow.
[397:30.10]Cinco de Mayo?
[397:31.01]No way.
[397:31.39]I ain't going anywhere.
[397:45.71]Uh, but thank you, Spirity Spanky, for the May the 4th be with you.
[397:48.60]I was gonna get a full Darth Vader costume, but I don't know.
[397:50.64]Wait, where's my Darth Vader t-shirt?
[397:52.70]What am I, stupid?
[397:56.26]Hey, Meefpleeble, thanks for the three bucks.
[397:58.04]This dinosaur joke is hilarious.
[397:59.62]No way, what's the opposite of hilarious?
[398:01.74]Oh, right, terrible.
[398:02.66]This joke is terrible.
[398:06.51]Was it?
[398:11.51]You didn't like the dinosaur VR thing?
[398:19.59]You didn't think that was funny?
[398:23.93]No, we loved it.
[398:26.13]The shower one was the best.
[398:30.37]I didn't even think about that.
[398:31.76]I'm just like watching someone in the shower.
[398:48.80]Ugh.
[398:52.12]We liked the turtle part.
[398:53.42]No, that's good.
[398:57.42]It's fine, whatever.
[398:59.62]What's the opposite of hilarious?
[399:00.82]I don't even know what the sounds were playing.
[399:05.05]I typed in dinosaur T-Rex sounds and pressed enter.
[399:08.65]And then opened the first one.
[399:10.47]And then put the goggles up.
[399:12.09]I had no idea what the fuck was happening.
[399:17.34]I'm still backed up on VODs and the first live stream I decided to catch and you're watching turtle porn and giving chat the adult talk.
[399:26.21]I gave the adult talk?
[399:34.15]When?
[399:38.81]Oh, the porn.
[399:39.35]Yeah, but that's real though.
[399:40.73]That's real life.
[399:48.51]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, though.
[399:49.61]Thank you, Trinart, for the tons of community subs.

[403:26.87]That used to be your signature dance move.
[403:29.58]Seems like you forgot about it.
[403:34.48]I... What is that?
[403:36.76]What's the Jerm of shuffle?
[403:39.85]Why am I stuck here?
[403:41.65]I'm gonna go forward.

[403:45.91]That's not mine.
[403:47.65]That's backpack kit.
[403:53.58]The Jerm of shuffle.
[404:00.57]I don't know what that is.
[404:03.99]Scooting in the chair is the Jerma shuffle.
[404:09.76]Your Alzheimer's has progressed pretty rapidly.
[404:13.96]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $15.

[404:51.74]No, it's not bad.
[404:52.78]Bad planning!
[404:55.09]No, I just don't do the same thing every day.
[404:59.61]No, that's it for that bottle.
[405:04.25]But we do what we do, and we do it when we do it.
[405:06.11]And I have a blast every time.
[405:10.90]Did he drink the whole bottle?
[405:13.32]Yeah, he did.
[405:21.33]Ah, yes he did.

[405:49.72]750 milliliters over the course of seven hours.
[405:57.14]That one bottle of wine in seven hours.
[405:59.93]That's the serving size.
[406:01.90]My mom can handle wine better... Moms can handle wine better than you.
[406:10.55]I don't give a shit about your mom's alcohol tolerance.
[406:15.27]I don't care.
[406:15.93]For all I know, your mother... I don't know who your mother is.
[406:29.98]Rude!
[406:32.46]I was just told that moms drink... I'm just defending myself.
[406:36.29]I'm not trying to be rude.
[406:36.95]I'm just defending.
[406:38.91]I'm pulling the Captain America shield up and going... My mom's better than this streamer.
[406:45.23]No, not at drinking wine.
[406:48.59]Maybe they are.
[406:53.23]What's the percentage?
[406:55.07]Wine is not that high.
[406:55.97]It's 16%.
[406:58.77]16% alcohol by volume it is copper and thief red blend it's good I'm a dog mom that counts I'm not okay I was not the VR stream made me three times more drunk I'm alright right now I mean I am I'm I'm a little drunk right now but I'm not it's not terrible
[407:28.92]I'm not like putting Twitch stocks on the stream.
[407:31.66]You understand?
[407:32.14]This is like a different kind of drunk.
[407:35.43]I'm not like doing backflips over here.
[407:38.33]What was I drinking that night?
[407:39.77]What was that?
[407:45.11]What was I drinking that night?
[407:46.49]It was wine, but what kind of wine?
[407:48.07]It was a crack wine.
[407:57.94]I don't know, it was definitely like crack wine.
[408:02.08]I was fucking crazy that night.
[408:10.54]But, Professor Dante, thanks for the $5, Professor Dante.

[408:32.66]Fish can be not, I mean, people eat octopus on pizza all the time, so.
[408:39.01]Isn't octopus number one pizza topping in Japan?
[408:44.69]I'm pretty sure that's a fact.
[408:49.69]No, yeah, it is.
[408:51.51]Octopus on pizza is the number one topping of pizza in Japan.
[408:56.71]Too expensive.
[408:58.79]Yeah, it would probably be pretty big.
[409:00.33]It would be expensive, wouldn't it?
[409:04.64]The Japanese put mayo on their pizza?
[409:06.88]I've had mayo on pizza before.
[409:08.44]I've had a BLT pizza.
[409:09.62]They're fucking amazing.

[409:19.08]Mayo with turkey, mayo with fucking tuna fish, mayo with egg salad.
[409:22.92]Really?
[409:25.66]Mayo with tuna?
[409:26.92]With tuna salad?
[409:27.73]You don't like that?
[409:28.51]How could you?

[410:40.77]Hearts for my boy.

[412:31.84]Take an ancestry test.
[412:37.61]Get the fuck out of here.
[412:43.97]That wine looks disgusting!
[412:48.97]What?
[412:49.73]Why?
[412:52.84]It's the fucking dishwasher.
[412:54.54]That's what you're seeing.
[412:59.68]I don't want to do it.
[413:00.52]No, I'm not doing that.
[413:04.56]My mother's side is... You don't need to know any of this shit.
[413:09.70]I'm a goddamn Elbertson.
[413:10.76]That's all you need to know.
[413:11.44]You don't need anything else.
[413:14.10]I'm Irish and Polish and that's it.
[413:20.39]That just burnt my eyes.
[413:21.27]Does wine burn your eyes?
[413:23.67]This must be bad wine.
[413:36.71]Elbertson, I know my lore.

[416:53.19]You can make some serious money.
[417:10.71]Do I just have to eat salmon on stream?
[417:16.01]If I just ate food on stream, what would happen?
[417:22.01]Is that it?
[417:26.27]Salmon fetish.
[417:29.99]No, there's no way.
[417:35.04]Maybe he wanted you to be healthy.
[417:36.36]Yeah, that's probably it.
[417:38.28]You guys have got your mind in the gutter.
[417:45.86]Why do you have braided hair?

[418:31.97]The big multiplayer competitive kind of games, I just, I don't do them anymore.
[418:37.31]I just can't.
[418:38.97]I don't have the time to do it anymore.
[418:40.25]I don't have the, I just can't do it.
[418:42.23]I really can't.
[418:43.91]It's a lot, it's a big time sink to really get into again.
[418:47.76]No, I can't do it.
[418:55.54]But I hope it's still fun.
[418:56.90]I do.
[418:58.29]Hey, Mr. Squishy, thanks for the $2.50.
[419:00.45]Figured you'd like to know I finished my bottle of absinthe.
[419:02.83]Great stream.
[419:04.63]Fuck, you finished a bottle of absinthe before I got through a bottle of red blend?
[419:13.12]Ugh.
[419:52.64]That's relaxing as fuck.
[420:05.95]Save that one.
[420:07.03]Put it in the folder.
[420:13.66]Hey, but no, but you finished the whole bottle of absinthe?
[420:16.53]Did you do the thing where you put the sugar cube and you melt the sugar cube out of the spoon and you put it in the abs in the dick shot?
[420:22.75]That's too much work for me.
[420:24.61]Just give me the fucking red blend and we'll be on our way.
[420:35.12]Drunk man?
[420:36.34]No.
[420:40.34]You messed up the hair.
[420:41.50]What am I...
[420:45.27]Why is it like four different pieces of hair here?
[420:49.13]Wait a minute, this is important.
[420:54.80]It's like five people's hair.
[421:00.96]Right?
[421:01.18]That's weird.
[421:09.64]That's like 10 people's hair.
[421:16.47]Hey, remember this?
[421:19.19]I'm not gonna do it.
[421:19.87]It's too ugly.
[421:21.27]The peasant hair.
[421:24.85]Like, I could be like... Right?
[421:28.40]Now, ready?
[421:31.02]Wait, let's get a better one.
[421:32.12]Ready?
[421:32.66]Like... Okay.
[421:53.48]The peasant hair.
[422:01.30]That doesn't look that bad.
[422:04.11]Oh, from over here it does.
[422:14.26]You look terrifying.
[422:15.44]I know.
[422:17.44]Uh, deleted!
[422:18.37]Laughing my ass off thanks to the five dollars!
[422:20.83]Hey, Jerma, great to see you so successful on a platform that rewards you for your creativity.
[422:26.01]Keep shredding those records, my dude.
[422:27.69]Much love.
[422:30.37]Thanks.
[422:30.99]That's... Thank you.
[422:35.52]Any milestone for viewers or subscribers, it's fucking... I can't believe it.
[422:40.40]Thank you.
[422:43.08]I just hope that the people that are here, if you stumble on this stream...
[422:49.04]You can relax and have a good time.
[422:53.92]It could be 1,000.
[422:54.40]It could be 5,000.
[422:54.82]It could be 10,000.
[422:57.44]I just want us all to have a good time.
[422:59.54]That's it.
[423:00.79]Good.
[423:04.25]Cool.
[423:04.49]Thanks, Jeremiah.
[423:13.17]Relax.
[423:15.87]Do a cooking stream?
[423:16.87]Yeah.
[423:18.25]Maybe one day.
[423:23.56]I'll do a cooking stream and I'll do my famous salmon.
[423:26.63]You saw a way better version of it like fucking an hour ago.
[423:35.83]Ah, but thank you voyeuristic vol for the five dollars.
[423:39.33]You ever consider the possibility that you're actually a failed prototype for a human labo imprinted with false memories?
[423:46.37]I think it realistically explains your labo obsession.
[423:48.79]It's an existential exercise.
[423:52.27]No.
[423:54.32]I just think it's just something stupid that I know that nobody else does.
[424:00.39]So I... So I do it.
[424:14.51]Campbell do it with me?
[424:15.45]Yeah, that'd be fun.
[424:18.90]Why does this guy sound like he's about to cry?
[424:21.60]Me?
[424:25.06]I sound like I'm going to cry?
[424:26.26]Like right now?
[424:28.83]What do you mean right?
[424:29.37]Like right the second?
[424:30.37]What are you talking about?
[424:31.59]Me?
[424:32.57]Are they talking about me?
[424:35.07]Are you talking about me?
[424:35.80]You fuckers ate all the pasta in the fridge and I only had one serving.
[425:20.94]Hey, I had a little bit of the pasta.
[425:24.00]It was good.
[425:26.30]Hey, Dr. Steen again.
[425:27.86]Dr. Steen, $15.
[425:30.16]Hey, Jerma.
[425:30.60]Today, me and my girlfriend of three years went through a nasty breakup and I'm the most depressed I've ever been in my entire life.
[425:37.23]I don't know what to do going forward and your stream was so helpful today.
[425:39.97]I can't thank you enough for your hilarity and humor.
[425:43.41]Really helped me out.
[425:47.80]That's rough.
[425:48.98]That's tough.
[425:51.37]Because that's a long time.
[425:54.30]But it obviously was not meant to be, right?
[426:00.82]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[426:01.84]Hopefully you're both okay.
[426:03.30]Hopefully you're doing alright.
[426:06.87]Just give yourself some time.
[426:10.07]Give yourself some time.
[426:12.77]Three years is a long time, but depending on, I don't know how old you are or what your stage of life is right now, but
[426:21.49]um just keep pegging away because you here's the one thing that people don't really talk about with that kind of scenario is three years and and you got a breakup but what happens if it was five or six or seven or eight
[426:45.92]You know what I mean?
[426:47.74]So, you know, you date somebody, you spend time with them, and then, you know, if it didn't work out, it didn't work out.
[426:57.03]I wish you the best.
[426:57.69]Hopefully you can find it again.
[427:00.69]Of course, right?
[427:03.53]Don't feel too bad.
[427:04.67]Don't feel too down.
[427:12.88]It's going to be hard for a little while.
[427:16.07]But just stay on track.
[427:23.27]And let life play out, right?
[427:35.13]Dermot's best when he's drunk because he isn't himself.
[427:40.29]I act like this all the time.
[427:42.07]What?
[427:43.39]You guys act like I'm fucking destroyed.
[427:48.30]What?
[427:56.67]I have a few drinks and all of a sudden it's like, oh, you know, he's like a real person now.
[428:01.41]What?
[428:08.79]How red's the tongue?
[428:10.89]Let's see.
[428:12.35]It's like purple.
[428:14.99]You sound like you're going to cry.
[428:16.61]That's not fucking true.
[428:25.47]Jerma unplugged.
[428:29.39]No, I... I understand.
[428:32.71]Let me give you a little bit of rebuttal, though.
[428:35.91]It's 11.15 Pacific.
[428:40.78]It's like 2 a.m.
[428:41.66]Eastern.
[428:43.34]We've had some drinks.
[428:45.33]The stream is over.
[428:46.77]You know, we've basically been hanging out.
[428:50.03]Obviously, there's still like 2,000 people.
[428:51.97]There's still a lot of people here, but... You know, we just... The broadcast has ended.
[428:59.40]We're just hanging out now.
[429:00.90]We do this frequently.
[429:04.96]So...
[429:08.22]You know, I get real sometimes at the end of these streams and we're just chilling and doing whatever.
[429:13.39]It's not, you know.
[429:16.69]What is this Wii business?
[429:20.39]There's 2,000 fucking people here.
[429:21.89]There's 2,000 people.
[429:24.35]There's 2,000 people here.
[429:26.77]It's a Wii.
[429:27.63]It's always a Wii.
[429:28.98]It's always a Wii.
[429:31.98]He's high.
[429:36.24]He went up an octave.
[429:37.02]That's how, you know, he gets serious.
[429:38.21]He went up an octave.
[429:38.93]It gets serious when he goes up an octave.
[429:47.65]I'm not going to, why would I cry on stream right now?
[429:52.56]Niall, Orion, thanks for the three bucks.
[429:54.12]So is Germacon going to be a thing?
[429:58.30]It's very possible.
[430:00.96]It's very, very possible.
[430:07.91]I wouldn't call it Germacon, though.
[430:09.37]I'd call it, like, I rent out space for, like, four hours, and if you're around, you can come.
[430:17.27]I don't, I wouldn't call it anything.
[430:23.28]But, yeah.
[430:25.86]Ah, Kane!
[430:27.44]Kane5707 gave 10 community subs about 40 minutes ago.
[430:32.46]Thank you, Kane.
[430:34.06]Really appreciate that.
[430:35.60]Thank you for the immense community subs.
[430:44.43]Jexpo.
[430:49.41]Can you try to do a flip?
[430:50.75]Yeah, sure.
[431:20.24]Same joke as last time.
[431:28.15]Exact same.
[431:29.43]No, literally no difference at all.
[431:35.61]Can you put both earphones in?
[431:38.65]Oh, I don't think I can.
[431:41.82]No, I can't.
[431:42.30]Hey, Ghost Twink, thanks for the $5.
[431:46.62]Best stream I've seen in a while.
[431:48.22]Thanks, Jerma.
[431:52.52]Thank you.
[431:53.14]That was good!
[431:55.18]Hold on.
[431:57.70]That's pretty good.
[431:58.88]That's my catchphrase now.
[432:03.10]Better not be.
[432:04.10]Uh, thank you for the five dollars though.
[432:06.80]That's a polite way of saying your last one hasn't been so great.
[432:10.46]What were the last two st- What?!
[432:13.24]Sam and Max.
[432:13.78]It was a fucking blast.
[432:16.32]And then... What was right before that?
[432:20.92]What was right?
[432:21.32]What was the last stream?
[432:21.98]What was before that?
[432:25.46]Dreams was fucking... Dreams was a lot of fun.
[432:29.56]Mordhau, you didn't like what?
[432:32.10]Mordhau, Dreams, Sam and Max, those were great streams.
[432:36.52]Mordhau sucked.
[432:39.63]Why?
[432:43.59]Mordhau sucked?
[432:44.69]Why?
[432:45.11]What?
[432:45.45]Because I was just play... Dreams was a lot of fun.
[432:54.80]It was one guy.
[433:03.09]I've had fun, like, it doesn't matter.
[433:04.63]Look, alright.
[433:07.97]Listen.
[433:12.18]Not every stream has to be like... No, never mind, never mind.
[433:17.90]We don't have to go.
[433:19.38]Not every stream has to be like the green screen kind of caliber of stuff.
[433:26.05]You know, the Sam & Max was fun and we just chilled and we played a game for like six hours.
[433:30.99]It's just fun to do that, you know?
[433:33.47]You know what?
[433:37.94]Nobody's expecting, I know, I know.
[433:39.78]I'm just kidding around.
[433:42.62]Ever since, uh-oh, we're crashing here.
[433:45.96]Ever since Jerma quit the VR scene, it's been downhill.
[433:50.92]I didn't quit VR.
[433:53.06]How high can I go?
[433:54.18]Lower your fucking, lower your volume, I'm serious.
[434:02.10]I'm not kidding.
[434:11.14]Did I break the internet?
[434:23.50]I think I just like fucked up the internet.
[434:30.08]I dropped like a thousand frames right there.
[434:38.51]I told you to lower your volume.
[434:41.23]I did just say that.
[434:43.85]What the fuck?
[434:44.49]I just said it.
[434:46.71]I said lower your volume, please.
[434:48.97]I'm gonna...
[434:56.73]My stream was lagging when you lowered your volume.
[435:00.21]Alright, hold on.
[435:03.95]I'll try again.
[435:04.27]I'm going to load up.
[435:13.06]I'm done doing this.
[435:14.76]That's it.
[435:15.42]That's all you get.
[435:16.08]I'm done.
[435:24.98]Bingo, Sunshine.
[435:25.80]Thanks for the 250.
[435:27.68]Who you got in the NL, Jerma?
[435:32.04]Who you got in the NL?
[435:34.66]In the National League?
[435:39.68]Lowest note.
[435:55.34]My girlfriend's not gonna sleep in the same bed with me tonight.
[436:24.77]It's the couch.
[436:26.17]It's the couch for us.
[436:27.35]What do you mean, us?
[436:29.67]Like, alright, yeah.
[436:30.90]Let's go.
[436:31.30]I'm gonna take the stream down to the couch.
[436:32.84]You're gonna watch me sleep.
[436:34.94]Okay.
[436:38.48]What a fucking weird stream.
[436:39.68]I would never let anybody watch me sleep.
[436:42.70]Ever.
[436:46.47]If I... Okay, listen.
[436:49.39]Who knows what kind of fucking weird shit you might say in your sleep.
[436:54.03]Like...
[436:56.74]Kiss.
[436:57.58]Kiss me.
[436:57.90]Kiss me.
[436:58.60]Kiss me.
[436:59.74]Kiss me.
[437:01.22]Imagine if I did that?
[437:03.16]I wouldn't have... I'd have no explanation for it.
[437:09.69]Ooh, yeah, I love Kool-Aid.
[437:10.89]Kool-Aid.
[437:11.17]Mmm, yummy Kool-Aid.
[437:12.71]Pour Kool-Aid in my cup, please.
[437:14.05]Pour Kool-Aid in my cup.
[437:15.91]Mmm, yum.
[437:19.33]You'd be terrified.
[437:19.91]You'd be fucking terrifying.
[437:21.31]No.
[437:26.39]Alright, we're almost done.
[437:29.54]Uh, thank you Comrade Curticus.
[437:33.58]Screw that, smoke it to enhance the stream.
[437:40.85]Bingo sun, but wait, wait, wait, bingo sunshine.
[437:43.07]What does that even mean?
[437:45.21]Who do you have in the, who do you got in the NL?
[437:47.41]Like National League?
[437:49.34]Like baseball?
[437:55.54]What do you mean NL?
[437:58.53]Who you got in the NL?
[438:02.27]I watch you.
[438:04.87]Oh, God.
[438:11.85]He does talk in his sleep sometimes.
[438:13.41]Alright, well, what about the, okay, Kim can corroborate this story.
[438:17.72]Listen to this shit one time.
[438:19.56]So listen, this is a big deal.
[438:21.96]One time, get this out of my ear.
[438:24.12]So one time I was asleep, and those of you that have slept in had kind of weird dreams before, you can maybe relate to those.
[438:31.75]So I had a dream where I was lying in my bed, and it was very normal.
[438:37.79]I just was in my bed, looking at the ceiling, and the door is there, the bed is here, there's a bureau over there, okay, whatever.
[438:47.04]I'm not awake.
[438:48.94]And I know I'm dreaming.
[438:50.48]And it's weird.
[438:51.68]And I'm like, what the fuck?
[438:52.81]Something's weird here.
[438:53.77]This is real, but it's not real.
[438:55.85]I'm asleep.
[438:56.69]Okay?
[438:58.05]So Kim is next to me in bed.
[439:01.07]And I look over and I feel... No, no, no, no.
[439:03.87]And you know when you're dreaming and you panic because you know you're in a dream and it's really real, but you're not lucid.
[439:11.35]I've lucid dreamed a few times before, but I can't, I've never been able to do it for like at least a few years.
[439:16.74]So, I'm sitting there going, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming.
[439:19.70]Fuck, I gotta wake up.
[439:20.44]This is terrifying.
[439:21.46]I'm panicking, I'm panicking.
[439:22.88]Okay, wake up.
[439:23.54]Please wake up.
[439:24.02]Wake up.
[439:24.30]Wake up.
[439:24.59]Wake up.
[439:24.83]Wake the fuck up.
[439:25.39]Wake up.
[439:26.15]And I woke up.
[439:27.87]And I'm in bed.
[439:30.15]Okay?
[439:31.17]What is this?
[439:32.61]Where am I?
[439:33.55]Okay, no, no, no.
[439:34.26]I'm just in bed.
[439:35.64]There's the door.
[439:36.82]There's the bureau.
[439:37.88]There's Kim.
[439:39.97]I'm still dreaming.
[439:41.07]No, this is not real.
[439:41.99]I'm still in a dream.
[439:43.49]This is fucked up.
[439:44.37]I'm not awake.
[439:45.53]I wasn't awake.
[439:46.09]I was still dreaming.
[439:47.48]So I'm lying there.
[439:48.20]Again, this is waking up.
[439:50.86]I thought I woke the fuck up.
[439:53.16]I'm still in a dream.
[439:55.12]This time, I start to hear a weird noise coming from the door.
[439:58.68]It's like...
[440:03.95]I just wanna get up.
[440:04.57]I just wanna go.
[440:05.35]I gotta stream in like fucking two hours.
[440:07.43]So I fucking, please wake up, wake up, wake up, wake the fuck up.
[440:11.22]Okay, I'm awake.
[440:14.24]Look over here.
[440:15.40]Door.
[440:17.62]Get up.
[440:18.32]Get the fuck out of bed.
[440:19.10]Get me the fuck out of here.
[440:20.64]Okay, what's over here?
[440:22.74]There's a light.
[440:24.36]Let me, I just have to make sure I'm awake.
[440:27.76]Flick the light switch up and down.
[440:29.39]Guess what?
[440:30.29]When you're in a dream, light switches do not work.
[440:33.56]You want to test if you're dreaming?
[440:35.38]Flick a light switch.
[440:36.70]If it doesn't work, you're dreaming.
[440:38.69]So I flicked the light switch like three times and the light doesn't turn on.
[440:43.75]So I'm just like, I'm fucking stuck here forever.
[440:49.60]And I'm like, I went back down and I went to go lie down and I fucking please just fucking wake up.
[440:54.88]God.
[440:58.38]and I wake up again and I'm not awake yet but only this time by the way this was like 40 minutes in my brain not like 10 seconds so I wake up I'm like no this is not right again I look over Kim looks at me and she's looking over like this staring at my eyes and I'm just like that's not the fucking real Kim that's not Kim I know it's not Kim and she's like
[441:25.48]what's wrong she had a real dick real fucked up demon voice and she got up and she was like like towards me and I was like oh shit like I grabbed her by like the head and she's sitting there going like like fucking snakes coming out of like all over her face and shit was fucking horrifying
[441:47.18]And I'm grabbing her by the neck, like trying to like strangle.
[441:50.16]And I'm like, no, this can't be real.
[441:52.62]And I'm trying to move her over.
[441:53.88]And finally, Kim in real life.
[441:57.15]woke me up in real life.
[441:59.91]And I'm just like, like I get pulled out of the fucking matrix.
[442:07.46]And she was like, you alright?
[442:08.42]You okay?
[442:08.88]And I'm just like, I'm fine.
[442:11.00]I'm fine.
[442:11.30]What's wrong?
[442:11.64]What do you mean?
[442:12.02]What's wrong?
[442:12.48]You don't want anyone to ever know that you're fucking dreaming and being like a psycho.
[442:15.23]So I'm like, yeah, it's just like, you're fucking tired.
[442:17.17]You know, it's like tired.
[442:18.93]Why?
[442:19.33]What's wrong?
[442:19.71]What's the matter?
[442:20.67]And she said, she said, you were lying there
[442:25.21]on your back, and you were going like this.
[442:45.26]That exact fucking noise.
[442:51.83]Just like,
[442:56.55]that's why she woke me up yeah mouth closed too mouth closed high pitch just exactly like that he's being rea- yes this is real this is real this is not made up oh it's terrifying I thought I was never gonna get out I thought I was stuck there forever
[443:22.83]She saved your life.
[443:24.11]I know, right?
[443:24.65]What if I didn't have a girlfriend?
[443:27.09]What if I was stuck there forever?
[443:28.46]What if I never got out of the dream world?
[443:30.12]I would have been dead.
[443:40.17]I woke up like five times.
[443:43.33]Oh, I had such a bad headache.
[443:45.79]I felt like shit that day.
[443:53.94]Imagine just lying there, just like silent, just like... She said, no emotion.
[444:02.90]You were just lying there doing that.
[444:08.84]God, something fucking wrong with me.
[444:15.73]What was I dreaming about?
[444:17.13]All that shit.
[444:19.05]At that moment, I was like strangling her because she was a demon.
[444:23.61]Remember, she was like, What's wrong?
[444:27.47]And I was like, that's a demon.
[444:28.19]That's not even Kim.
[444:28.67]That's a fucking demon.
[444:38.98]You okay, dude?
[444:49.74]Thank you, Jack, for the $2.50.
[445:07.88]Wait till you see this shit.
[445:47.73]I look like 60.
[446:00.49]Oh, my God.
[446:02.51]The same picture.
[446:08.48]Here you go.
[446:08.98]Here's a link.
[446:11.92]Oh, my God.
[446:12.52]That's fucking funny.
[446:21.10]Why is my posture like that?
[446:22.54]I don't know, because I'm fucking 60.
[446:24.74]Why can I not paste this?
[446:26.16]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[446:40.05]That's fucking hilarious.
[446:42.72]Thank you.
[446:44.54]Thank you, Jack.
[446:46.54]Thank you, Jack, for the 250 and that image.
[446:49.22]Jerma lied about Fruity Loops.
[446:51.88]Thanks for the 250.
[446:52.78]Hey, Jerma, didn't watch the stream because it was boring.
[446:54.86]Fuck, come on.
[446:57.46]Hope you had a good Star Wars nerd consumerism day.
[447:21.69]I had fun, alright?
[447:22.77]It doesn't matter.
[447:30.70]You said that an hour ago.
[447:32.72]How long were you here for?
[447:33.82]You probably watched the whole damn thing.
[447:35.35]Alright, sorry, didn't watch the stream.
[447:38.49]I mean, I've been here for like four and a half hours, though.
[447:43.81]Thank you, Jerma lied about Fruity Loops.
[447:48.39]Hey, John Horns, thanks for the $2.50.
[447:49.87]Hey, Jerma, finally got a big boy job, so it's hard to catch you.
[447:53.57]Anyway, I'm drunk off my ass on Borg, which is half vodka, half water, and Mio energy.
[448:02.29]Give it a try.
[448:03.77]I love the V-neck.
[448:04.75]Take care.
[448:08.40]Half vodka, half Mio water?
[448:14.48]I like V-necks.
[448:17.50]I used to get a V-neck.
[448:19.85]No, no, that person really, that person got it.
[448:22.95]John Horns gets it.
[448:24.63]V-necks accentuates your fucking clavicle.
[448:27.11]And it shows off your fucking dimple here, your neck dimple.
[448:31.16]It's a good look.
[448:32.86]I can pull it off.
[448:34.30]I can pull off a V-neck.
[448:36.06]I've got the fucking neck dimple and the clavicle to fucking go for it.
[448:44.73]V-necks are for lizard people.
[448:46.67]Watch his eyes.
[448:47.19]Watch his eyes.
[448:48.29]Watch his eyes.
[448:49.07]If they move really fast back and forth, he's a fucking lizard.
[448:51.22]Watch his eyes.
[448:53.58]Slow it down.
[448:53.96]Somebody slow it down.
[448:55.30]He might be.
[448:56.24]He might be.
[448:56.84]Slow it down.
[448:59.98]What if his eyes turn green for a second?
[449:03.92]Hey, Effectator.
[449:05.18]Effectator resident editor.
[449:07.74]Thanks for the 250.
[449:08.28]I finally committed to teaching myself how to program this game idea event for a long time.
[449:13.09]If I complete it in the next six years, will you play it on stream and tear it to fucking shreds?
[449:20.91]Probably, yeah.
[449:22.00]Yeah, I mean, I don't know why not.
[449:25.34]If you're done in six years, I mean, whatever, I'll be fucking 40.
[449:29.68]Hey, deleted laughing my ass off.
[449:32.48]Hopefully this is funny and no one has done it before.
[449:40.74]This is called Sellout Jerma.
[449:44.65]Sellout Jerma is this video's title.
[449:47.65]Let's take a look at it, see how it is.
[450:00.66]I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready for me money.
[450:14.01]Thank you for the $5.
[450:16.89]Deleted laughing my ass off.

[450:44.38]Thank you.
[450:46.79]That was a lot of fun to make.
[450:48.31]It was... We did the Christmas thing on stream.
[450:52.27]Not the grandpa, the Christmas stuff.

[451:14.71]You know what I mean?

[451:40.59]Jerma, when you have nice hair, can we call you perma?
[451:43.79]Yeah, like right now.
[451:47.17]Say no.
[451:48.61]So I feel better about myself.
[451:56.67]Jacoby, thanks for the $4.
[451:58.39]Bleed purple, dab, you stinko.
[452:00.61]Sure thing.
[452:02.73]Just pretend I did.
[452:04.74]Thanks for the $4.
[452:06.82]Grappled mace, thanks for the $2.50.
[452:08.60]Nice ringlet bangs.
[452:11.08]I don't have bangs.
[452:15.45]Ringlet bangs?
[452:21.41]Oh, you ruined your hair before you read the bits.
[452:36.66]That looks not good.
[452:39.54]That doesn't look good at all.
[452:42.14]How'd you get your hair like that?
[452:43.62]I was born.
[452:44.50]I was born.
[452:48.00]That's it.
[452:54.98]Do you guys find it hard to wink with both any, you know, your right or left eye?
[453:00.99]Like, ready?
[453:05.83]What looked more natural?
[453:07.96]Left or right?
[453:09.68]I need to know.
[453:16.96]This one looks better?
[453:17.64]Yeah, it's almost like I can feel my face pulling over here when I wink with my right eye.
[453:28.16]Like... What's wrong, Jeremy?
[453:36.33]What are you doing?
[453:36.85]Are you sneaking in here?
[453:38.92]What's wrong with you?
[453:40.06]Why are you sneaking in here?
[453:42.34]Why do you have a ripped up shirt on?
[453:44.14]This is yours.
[453:46.70]When did I rip the shirt that bad?
[453:49.94]Oh, shit.
[453:50.42]It's a demon.
[453:51.82]I'm going to have to get rid of her.
[454:01.30]There's nothing in there.
[454:03.96]Is this a dream?
[454:05.34]Ah, shit.
[454:05.84]She might not be real.
[454:09.82]Stop.
[454:11.87]I woke her up.
[454:12.65]Ah, probably.
[454:14.45]You've been waking me up.
[454:15.79]It's okay, though.
[454:17.83]It's okay when you're on the couch tonight.
[454:20.79]I can... Was I... Wait, I was better?
[454:30.06]That one?
[454:32.18]Which one?
[454:43.80]I'm gonna go in the bed like this!
[454:51.63]I'm gonna go... Put both legs out too!
[454:58.46]I'm gonna T-pose in bed.
[455:01.48]Hey Cosmic Moses, thanks for the five dollars.
[455:06.12]Jeremy, I didn't mention this because I didn't want to make you in chat sad.
[455:10.90]But I thought you should know my precious doggo, Venus, passed away.
[455:14.70]I showed her on stream before.
[455:16.20]She was 18.
[455:18.98]I've been miserable for weeks, but you've been cheering me up.
[455:22.24]I uploaded some photos of her.
[455:23.55]Let's take a look.
[455:25.15]Show them if you want.
[455:25.85]Sorry for this giant message.
[455:27.05]No, no, no.
[455:27.89]No problem at all.
[455:31.21]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[455:32.11]Aww.
[455:40.89]What a cute little doggo.
[455:42.15]18.
[455:43.71]That's a long life.
[455:46.53]That's a long life.
[455:53.84]Well, she looks very, very loved.
[455:57.28]I'll link the album here for anybody that wants to see.
[456:01.28]She looks very loved.
[456:05.99]Rest in peace.
[456:11.45]Enjoy the years that you had with her because she looks fucking... She's beautiful.
[456:21.84]Yeah, 18 is legendary.
[456:23.10]Yeah, that's a very, very long life.
[456:26.58]My last dog that I had before Otto went to 17.
[456:29.05]So... At that point, that's a real legit family member.
[456:34.09]It is.
[456:37.37]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[456:44.06]Rest in peace to Venus.
[456:51.92]Thank you for even sharing it all with all that.
[456:56.29]Thank you, Cosmic Moses.
[457:04.03]Beautiful dog.

[457:57.86]Thank you, Bingo Sunshine, for the $2.50.
[458:00.11]The ball of koala thinks of $5.
[458:01.89]Kim checks, she just came in the room.
[458:04.31]So you very clearly saw her go out that door.
[458:10.47]Don't need to check when she's already gone.
[458:14.75]Dr. Steen, thanks for the $5.
[458:16.27]The same exact thing happened to me.
[458:18.37]I woke up like four times or more and it kept being a dream, but I kept changing fucking locations.
[458:25.24]It was awful.
[458:29.28]Yeah.
[458:31.60]When you try to wake up from a dream and you wake up in another dream, your panic meter goes to a thousand.
[458:39.13]And then when you finally do wake up, it's like you've ran like four marathons.
[458:44.48]You feel like crap.
[458:48.24]Did you cry to the movie Click?
[458:51.06]I've never seen that movie start to finish.
[458:53.74]I just remember when he's like punching the shit out of David Hasselhoff's face.
[458:59.13]I don't remember anything else.
[458:59.99]And then he just goes, wow, I got a headache.
[459:01.39]That's the only thing I remember.
[459:04.19]Let's get the credits rolling.
[459:05.43]What do you say?
[459:05.81]They're going to be over my face.
[459:11.96]Has this been in the background this whole time?
[459:15.84]Why didn't anybody say anything?
[459:18.06]Why didn't anybody say anything?
[459:25.78]Here come the new subs and the resubs.
[459:28.02]Thank you, everybody.
[459:30.59]Much love to you.
[459:33.37]There they go.
[459:35.97]The Labo VR kit.
[459:42.67]It was kind of nice, actually.
[459:43.88]This thing is actually really cool.
[459:50.18]This whole thing was built with cardboard.
[459:53.30]That's... I mean, that's remarkable.
[459:57.61]This is really cool.
[459:58.69]It just is.
[460:07.41]Come to my house and fight me.
[460:08.57]Why would I want to fight you?
[460:09.47]I would be like, hey man, like, relax.
[460:12.96]We did have a couple more.
[460:15.42]CluelessSniper250 from CluelessSniper.
[460:17.48]Thanks a lot, CluelessSniper.
[460:19.34]ManBearPig gave $5.
[460:22.40]Is that Vegas meetup still going to happen?
[460:24.72]I'd almost definitely come out for that.
[460:26.60]Sounds like a fun time.
[460:28.45]Yeah.
[460:30.69]Instead of like a PAX East or like a PAX Prime or an E3, I'll probably just end up going out there and see if I can get that actually to work.
[460:43.21]Am I going to go to Evo?
[460:44.31]I will probably go to Evo because it's in Vegas.
[460:46.27]So why wouldn't I, right?
[460:49.95]It's like fucking right down the street.
[460:52.35]Go to Evo.
[460:56.29]Like that shit is right down the street.
[460:58.35]So why would I not go?
[461:00.52]It would be stupid if I didn't.
[461:06.38]Because it's really interesting stuff.
[461:12.45]but we got a man bear pig thank you for that uh nile orion thank you no meme but how do you feel about pet rats I rats are incredibly intelligent loving very very awesome animals like rats are highly intelligent adorable fun cuddly loving the creatures yeah
[461:42.44]I love rats.
[461:43.88]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[461:45.16]Haven't seen you in a while.
[461:46.00]Hi, Garfield.
[461:47.70]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[461:49.04]250.
[461:49.12]I was thinking about TF2 again, Jerma.
[461:52.42]It's a crying shame what Valve's doing to that game.
[461:55.77]The last good thing added was naming the scout after you.
[462:00.19]I don't know if that's real, though.
[462:03.89]I mean, I think that might just be a coincidence.
[462:06.89]If it's not, then like I said, I've made a statement about it before.
[462:12.23]That's incredibly fucking wonderful that I could even imagine anyone would ever do that.
[462:16.75]It's probably just a coincidence, but... That community is... Un-fucking-believable.
[462:26.54]So... Uh, but what were you gonna say?
[462:29.12]The last good thing added was naming the scout after you.
[462:31.88]I know everyone compares you to the scout, but what class is your favorite in terms of personality regardless of gameplay?
[462:37.14]The spy.
[462:38.67]I got TF2 after seeing your Fat Guy NG vid.
[462:41.97]It's the first vid I saw of yours.
[462:43.81]Garf's been a fan for over four years.
[462:46.84]You want to be in Shrek 2.
[462:49.04]Garf got hired for independent retelling of Shrek 2.
[462:51.62]Phil is in it.
[462:53.06]Phil Lord is in it.
[462:53.84]Garf Goo.
[462:57.02]I don't think I want to be in Shrek 2.
[463:00.76]The Spy is my favorite character in that game, just personality-wise.
[463:04.04]I think he's really fun and interesting.
[463:06.46]And who couldn't love the Heavy?
[463:09.81]The Heavy is just a lovable, amazing character.
[463:16.54]But yeah, TF2 is... Would I be sitting here right now talking to you guys if I didn't play Team Fortress and make all those videos?
[463:29.08]No.
[463:30.42]Probably not.
[463:32.34]So Team Fortress was a very real start of everything I was doing.
[463:38.05]So, I mean, I played that game for years.
[463:41.35]It was like the biggest part of, it was a huge part of my life.
[463:47.37]So I owe a lot to that community.
[463:49.19]I know I owe a lot to Team Fortress and Valve for even making the game in the first place.
[463:57.49]I owe a lot to that community.
[463:58.85]They propped me up really fucking high.
[464:01.47]They did.
[464:04.50]So I have nothing but love for that community at all.
[464:07.52]Nothing at all but love.
[464:14.19]And finally, we have Thru... Multitrip gave $5.
[464:18.83]I can't go to Germacon.
[464:19.99]Can you come to Meecon instead?
[464:24.68]Can you go to Meecon?
[464:27.08]I don't know what Meecon is.
[464:28.64]What is Meecon?
[464:30.86]It's me.
[464:31.38]It's just Meecon.
[464:32.24]It's me.
[464:35.03]Call it Jexpo.
[464:37.15]No, it's just a hangout.
[464:38.35]It would just be a night if you were around.
[464:41.91]That would be it.
[464:49.88]Jerma and friends.
[464:50.56]Yeah, just whoever.
[464:54.72]It is 11.50.
[464:55.68]It's 12 o'clock.
[464:58.36]Almost 8 hours here.
[465:00.94]I know this is going to be a longer one.
[465:05.81]Garfield the Monday Killer 250.
[465:10.04]No, I wasn't joking.
[465:11.08]The guy who made 21 Jump Street is in the new Shrek 2 reboot.
[465:16.12]Wait, what do you mean Shrek 2 reboot?
[465:20.40]What do you mean?
[465:22.54]What happened to the Shrek 1 reboot?
[465:25.94]Okay, let me get this straight.
[465:27.06]You're going to go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farkad will give you back a swamp, which you only don't have because you filled it full of priests in the first place.
[465:34.13]Is that about right?
[465:35.01]You know what?
[465:36.11]Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.
[465:39.23]I don't get it, Shrek.
[465:40.25]Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him?
[465:42.03]You know, throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread.
[465:46.31]You know, the whole ogre trip.
[465:47.96]Oh, and know what?
[465:49.82]Maybe I could have a decapitated entire village, but... What's going on here?
[465:56.50]We got over 200 people to remake Shrek.
[466:05.52]What?
[466:10.15]This is an hour and 30 minute video.
[466:19.35]Their heads on a plate.
[466:20.87]Got a knife.
[466:21.67]Cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
[466:27.68]Cool.
[466:28.30]You handle the dragon.
[466:29.42]I'll handle the stairs.
[466:31.44]I'll find those stairs.
[466:32.68]I'll whip their butt too.
[466:33.66]That's right.
[466:35.40]Take it off.
[466:36.72]Ow.
[466:37.71]Okay.
[466:38.89]Easy.
[466:40.67]As you command, your- It's like fucking a ton of different videos.
[466:45.81]I'm gonna have to watch this whole thing.
[466:48.93]Not tonight.
[466:53.67]Oh, that's really interesting though.
[466:55.19]But hey, Juno upset $06.96.
[466:57.83]Thanks for all you do, Jerma.
[466:59.10]Thanks for all you do.
[467:00.20]You just gave me $7.
[467:01.02]That's a lot.
[467:04.14]That's it.
[467:05.82]A lot.
[467:06.24]That's a lot of money to give somebody that you watch on the internet.
[467:10.70]Thank you.
[467:12.16]Thanks for all you do.
[467:14.44]You guys do a lot.
[467:17.57]And with that, I will see you guys.
[467:19.85]What time is it?
[467:21.15]I'm supposed to stream tomorrow.
[467:23.24]Oops.
[467:30.66]What is it?
[467:31.14]Midnight?
[467:32.98]Alright.
[467:33.26]Here's the deal.
[467:34.88]I'm going to fucking go to bed.
[467:37.97]And if I get up, we're going to go tomorrow.
[467:42.07]Tomorrow is supposed to be Sam and Max episode six, season one.
[467:47.37]And then season two, episode one, maybe episode two.
[467:52.56]If I don't get up to stream, then we're going to go, then we're probably going to go either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or he's going to justify his absence now.
[468:07.22]Yeah, I mean, I'll see you guys on fucking Monday.
[468:18.65]I did the whole bottle.
[468:19.43]Holy shit.
[468:20.55]Just clip that.
[468:21.39]Clip it.
[468:21.67]Somebody clip it.
[468:24.89]No, if I'm, for some reason I'm not around, I will, um, I will be around on Monday or Tuesday.
[468:32.20]Probably Monday.
[468:33.38]Monday late afternoon.
[468:35.22]Or tomorrow.
[468:36.68]Or Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?
[468:40.46]Let me, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[468:41.20]I have a, what's my colonoscopy?
[468:43.48]Not to get real here, but when is my colonoscopy?
[468:45.80]Let's see.
[468:51.66]Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[468:54.60]Oh shit, it's tomorrow!
[468:59.25]No.
[469:01.83]Today's May... May 4th.
[469:14.34]5th, Monday the 6th.
[469:17.60]Seven, eight, nine, 10.
[469:19.88]Alright, so listen, hear me out, hear me out.
[469:25.48]Four, we'll go like four or five days next week.
[469:33.12]What a red mess that colonoscopy would be.
[469:38.84]I'm thinking, I'm thinking, right?
[469:42.56]Maybe Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.
[469:48.60]That's probably a good idea.
[469:50.88]Because I got a lot of things I want to do.
[469:56.24]That's filthy.
[469:57.84]It's just like, oh, what did you do last night?
[470:00.00]I don't know.
[470:02.06]I just dragon played Labo.
[470:03.86]Yeah, because I've got shit to do on Monday.
[470:15.07]Alright, here you go.
[470:15.65]Ready?
[470:16.87]Bingo.
[470:17.93]Listen, listen up.
[470:18.79]We're not done streaming, by the way.
[470:19.93]You think I'm going to leave?
[470:21.61]Are you fucking kidding me?
[470:24.51]I'm not done.
[470:26.77]So, plan four, because I've had some shit to drink and I have shit to do on Monday.
[470:35.34]The 7th, the 8th, the 9th, and the 10th, and the 12th.
[470:40.16]We'll go five days this coming week here.
[470:43.35]So we'll go back.
[470:44.13]We'll come back on Tuesday.
[470:45.43]Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[470:47.41]Sunday.
[470:51.07]We will finish Sam and Max.
[470:55.51]Big hands.
[470:56.69]You think I got big hands?
[471:00.05]You said that about this week.
[471:01.67]Well, we did.
[471:03.07]Yeah, but I didn't think I was going to drink this much.
[471:06.07]We did what?
[471:06.55]What did we do?
[471:06.91]Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday.
[471:09.43]Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[471:14.28]You look like you lost weight.
[471:16.70]I don't think I did.
[471:22.60]Did I?
[471:22.88]Probably for the best.
[471:24.54]Alright, well, I'll let you know.
[471:28.76]I'll let you know.
[471:30.12]We'll go at least four or five days this week.
[471:33.09]If there's nothing tomorrow, if for some reason I can't fucking go tomorrow, which, I mean, we'll see.
[471:37.71]I'll be around.
[471:39.31]I'll let you know.
[471:39.89]I'll be in the chat.
[471:43.47]And we'll go from there.
[471:44.97]So if there's nothing tomorrow, then we'll do like Tuesday to Friday.
[471:51.25]I'm just going to leave it at that because I really don't know how I'm going to feel tomorrow.
[472:02.66]Maybe I'll feel fine.
[472:03.52]And if I feel fine, then we'll just fucking go tomorrow.
