[00:00.82]Stream's bopping.
[00:02.02]Stream will be bopping.
[00:04.48]Stream is currently bopping.
[00:09.00]Hey.
[00:10.52]Welcome back.
[00:10.98]Hope you had a good Monday.
[00:15.98]I had a good Monday.
[00:16.60]I had a great Monday.
[00:23.21]Tuesday is now.
[00:24.71]Hopefully we have a good Tuesday too.
[00:29.61]Every day of the week.
[00:31.58]Is hopefully a good day.
[00:35.60]Today... We're gonna do something I've been looking forward to for a while since it was announced.
[00:41.93]We're gonna play Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey.
[00:46.23]It's a game where you play as an ape.
[00:49.77]And you have to evolve... In this permadeath.
[00:57.19]I don't know much else.
[00:58.45]I have... I'll be honest.
[01:00.92]I have read the reviews.
[01:04.14]They're very bad.
[01:06.50]But... Who cares about reviews?
[01:09.58]You think I give a shit about a review?
[01:16.42]They're not great.
[01:17.73]Let's just put it that way.
[01:23.13]You think I care?
[01:27.18]I'll review the game when I'm done.
[01:29.32]And you can trust my review because it's from the heart and it's from the brain connected.
[01:37.89]Equal parts brain and equal parts heart.
[01:41.41]You're getting a true review.
[01:47.09]But... You're not gonna get that.
[01:49.77]You're gonna get me playing the game for as long as it takes.
[01:54.60]There's also something I want to talk about.
[01:56.62]Real quick.
[01:58.38]I want to talk about the Activity Book stream.
[02:03.15]Some of you know what this is, some of you don't know what this is.
[02:04.91]I have not really gone into detail on it, and I'm going to do it right now.
[02:09.11]Because I've been pushing it off and pushing it off, and I don't want to do that anymore.
[02:12.03]So, what is the activity?
[02:12.91]The activity book stream is going to be a stream where some community content is made and is put into a highlights-style activity book.
[02:26.01]We're talking dot-to-dots.
[02:27.72]All community-themed, by the way.
[02:29.28]Dot-to-dots.
[02:30.94]Where's Waldo?
[02:32.74]Me.
[02:33.18]Well, it's going to be Where's Jerma?
[02:34.74]You know, you've got to get that point across.
[02:37.02]And other random brain teasers and activities and coloring books and shit.
[02:42.97]This is all supposed to be next week.
[02:47.27]The deadline for submissions for this is currently the 31st.
[02:50.73]But I'm going to move that forward.
[02:52.83]Because I don't think that's enough time because I haven't really talked about it.
[02:56.17]It's been in the Discord for a little while.
[02:57.69]It's only in the Discord.
[02:59.44]Please, if you want to submit something, which it is a full submission for anybody in the community that wants to do this.
[03:06.30]There are a few things that I'm going to commission out on my own.
[03:09.24]But stuff like dot-to-dot, and if you don't know what a dot-to-dot image is, it's when there's the template of dots, and they're numbered, and you have to connect, you know, 1, 2, 3, to 100, 200, whatever it is.
[03:21.81]And it makes an image.
[03:23.31]But I want to do this thing.
[03:24.61]It seemed like a fun idea.
[03:28.39]Read the rules in the Discord if you want to participate.
[03:31.57]The new deadline for submissions for those activities...
[03:36.97]is going to be.
[03:38.29]Are you listening?
[03:39.92]Are you listening?
[03:47.12]September 3rd is the last day that you can submit something.
[03:51.89]Not everything will be chosen, we're gonna choose some of the ones we think are obviously a little bit better, or more interesting, or fun.
[03:57.41]There'll be some shitposts, don't worry.
[03:59.63]I probably shouldn't have just given the blanket statement there that you can do shitposts, because I shouldn't, I don't think I should have said that.
[04:06.90]And then the actual stream will be the 7th of September.
[04:15.62]This is not some huge deal, right?
[04:18.07]This is not, oh my god, this is a fucking huge stream.
[04:21.87]It's just a fun thing I wanted to do.
[04:24.05]Probably take a few hours.
[04:28.17]To give more detail on some of the things, we can do it a little bit later.
[04:31.41]I think when more people are here.
[04:34.49]But I want, where's Waldo?
[04:37.11]So you can make an image of, if you don't know what a where's Waldo, you kind of need to like know what all these things are before making them, I guess.
[04:44.36]But there's going to be like 10 to 12 where's Waldos, but it's me.
[04:47.18]10 to 12, maybe 15 dot to dots.
[04:50.22]10 to 12 brain teasers written by somebody in the community.
[04:53.84]10 to 12 jokes.
[04:55.18]10 to 12 coloring pages.
[04:58.49]There's a whole thing in the Discord.
[05:00.70]Read those rules, take a look for yourself, and if you want to participate, go for it.
[05:03.26]If you don't, then enjoy it when it happens.
[05:08.31]Now let's... Turn into a monkey.
[05:12.57]That sounds good to me.
[05:21.79]Game sucks.
[05:22.49]Next already.
[05:23.19]No.
[05:24.23]Ancestors.
[05:27.85]This game is going to be wild.
[05:30.11]It's going to be intense.
[05:31.77]You're probably going to see a couple of like... I'm probably going to be like, fuck!
[05:35.52]At one point, I just want to warn everybody for the bad language coming up here.
[05:43.08]Because there is permadeath.
[05:45.73]Do you think I can get through this whole thing without dying?
[05:48.61]Absolutely not.
[05:50.05]Here we go.
[05:53.25]You're going to see a couple of fails and a couple of triumphs.
[06:01.29]lineage name this is the name of all through history so we got to think back like 60 million years ago like 100 million years ago were there any elbertsons back then no guys they were no elbertsons elbertson is a european name it means guy who makes shoes

[07:12.56]I'm just gonna be the Elbertsons.
[07:15.48]This is where it started.

[07:26.19]Choose your game experience first time.
[07:31.78]What do you mean?
[07:32.42]How could you do a second time?
[07:33.50]Explore, expand, and evolve by experimenting what our oldest ancestors had to face.
[07:41.37]Player help.
[07:42.11]Choose the level of assistance.
[07:43.41]Full HUD, full tutorial.
[07:45.55]Full HUD, no tutorial.
[07:48.03]Minimal HUD, full tutorial.
[07:49.81]No HUD, no tutorial.
[07:53.05]How am I supposed to play the game?
[07:54.87]I'm not doing that.
[08:01.19]Full HUD, full tutorial.
[08:04.46]How about minimal HUD, full... No, I have to do this like... Minimal HUD, full tutorial.
[08:11.94]Okay, that sounds okay.
[08:17.08]You guys are going to have to help me here.
[08:19.68]No balls.
[08:20.92]That's fine.
[08:22.73]Minimal HUD, full tutorial.
[08:24.49]We're just going to go random.
[08:36.96]Got it.
[08:40.50]Here we go.
[08:43.82]Lineage.
[08:44.38]Elbertsons.
[08:45.08]Game mode.
[08:45.60]First time.
[08:46.16]Settlement.
[08:46.64]Hidden.
[08:47.10]Waterfall.
[08:47.78]Oasis.
[08:48.86]Female.
[08:50.06]Clan size.
[08:50.98]Medium.
[08:51.68]I didn't get to pick my clan.
[08:56.60]Here we go.
[08:58.92]Mama Elbertson is going to take us home here.
[09:04.60]Here it is.
[09:05.02]The first ever human to ever be recorded.
[09:18.59]Shh.
[09:20.19]Inspired by true events.
[09:22.09]Alright.
[09:24.55]You can't... You can't say that.
[09:26.25]I don't think that's... The world and characters you will encounter are meant to represent archetypes of a place and of a moment, not the exact depiction.
[09:35.10]This adventure was made by Panache Digital Games, which is composed of all these people.
[09:41.76]Based on a true story.
[09:44.66]Yeah, but we don't know.
[09:46.30]They didn't write this stuff down.
[09:48.76]You can't say based on a true story based on a bone.
[09:53.37]With the help of... They did.
[10:01.77]In the following hours, you will relive the challenges of the dawn of humanity.
[10:05.63]Based on a true bone, embark into the never-ending odyssey of human progression on this planet.
[10:11.67]Use your body, senses, mind and voice to guide your voyages.
[10:17.08]Gain strength in numbers and advance the species.
[10:21.56]Survive the elements, teach your family, build a home.
[10:26.64]Make sure to watch your food and thirst meters.
[10:30.15]We won't help you very much.
[10:32.31]And remember...
[10:36.19]Evolution is not set in stone.
[10:37.54]It is your path to forth.
[10:42.92]This is very loud, yes.
[10:45.38]Where am I?
[10:46.04]Do I land on like a comet?
[10:48.66]This is how it started.
[10:49.44]We crash-landed on fucking comets!
[10:54.37]That's me!
[11:00.27]Got it.
[11:00.77]First try.
[11:01.37]Ah, fuck.
[11:01.87]I dropped it.
[11:03.53]It's alright.
[11:03.85]There's probably more of those.
[11:04.53]That's probably the currency.
[11:11.28]Watch out!
[11:17.34]What?
[11:20.60]Look at all these animals.
[11:23.02]They have every animal.
[11:24.04]Wait, was this... Weren't that dinosaurs?
[11:29.10]This is supposed to be like 500 million years ago.
[11:40.32]Alright, well, that guy's got like... Uh-oh, watch out.
[11:46.86]Here comes the... It's the Jaguar, I think.
[11:51.34]Jaguars attacked alligators?
[11:53.27]They did?
[11:53.73]No, they didn't.
[11:55.39]Based on one true bone.
[11:56.89]They dug up a bone, and now they can tell me that that panther attacked that alligator?
[12:01.55]I don't think so.
[12:05.35]Where do we start?
[12:11.40]Volume 1, Before Us.
[12:12.24]Okay.
[12:12.42]Is this us?
[12:13.00]This is us.
[12:13.40]Alright.
[12:42.69]We got the fish.
[12:44.33]We got to eat it.
[12:52.08]Watch out for the bird!
[12:52.92]Holy shit.
[12:56.26]Okay.
[13:07.64]Regain safety in a hiding spot, or in your clan's sett- What the fuck is going on?
[13:13.46]Why are there, like, spectres?
[13:17.32]Tap Y to use your intelligence.
[13:18.86]Use it to identify a hiding spot, your clan settlement, or other practical items.
[13:24.65]What?
[13:25.25]I'm a baby, okay, so... This is intelligence.
[13:29.21]Don't move to stay in intelligence.
[13:32.91]Look around.
[13:33.83]Right stick to highlight point of interest.
[13:35.59]Then follow the steps displayed on the contextual UI.
[13:38.45]So, okay, over there.
[13:40.67]Right?
[13:43.30]Go towards the square.
[13:44.50]Alright, let's go towards the square.
[13:53.20]Why are all these, like, nightmare images?
[13:55.72]What do you mean...
[14:06.21]I can't, like, drown.
[14:10.51]Now what do you want me to do?
[14:16.58]Yeah, I know a hiding spot.
[14:18.54]Latibolum.
[14:21.98]Oh.
[14:27.28]Alright, how do I sprint?
[14:29.97]How do you punch?
[14:36.44]Dude, why do they keep doing this?
[14:37.96]I don't want to see anymore of these weird, like, 3D animations.
[14:45.35]There it is.
[14:45.65]Alright, I found it.
[14:48.55]Sense of hearing.
[14:49.15]Don't move to stay in the senses.
[14:51.38]This is the representation of the sounds within range.
[14:55.04]Look around to target a sound.
[15:06.66]What?
[15:10.21]Minimal fucking tutorial.
[15:11.63]Minimal HUD.
[15:13.71]I found the hiding spot.
[15:14.49]It's right here.
[15:19.79]It said look around for the sound and then... What did it want me to do?
[15:28.63]What is that?
[15:32.35]That... Another... Another person?
[15:36.34]What is that?
[15:39.72]Food?
[15:42.24]Current clan settlement.
[15:45.11]Okay, well, let's... Let me go into the hiding spot.
[15:50.91]Am I hiding?
[15:52.93]Is this a hiding spot?
[15:58.34]Grabbing foliage and creepers.
[15:59.92]Jump and hold A to grab the foliage or the creepers when pressed passing through it.
[16:04.37]Trunks, branches, and rock walls are... What the hell is that next to me?
[16:07.69]That's me.
[16:08.21]Okay.
[16:08.51]Well, I fucking didn't even see what it was.
[16:11.95]Is it up here?
[16:13.71]Should I get up here?
[16:14.39]No, look, this is right there.
[16:19.94]Hiding spot.
[16:25.58]How do I get in this hiding spot?
[16:34.97]How do I get in this?
[16:36.73]Okay, that was... I clearly was... I did it.
[16:46.20]Find the lost child of your clan.
[16:51.60]What do you mean?
[16:53.86]Sprint L. L to move.
[16:55.77]Hold A to sprint.
[16:56.75]Release A to jump.
[17:01.11]Alright.
[17:03.23]What do you mean, find the lost baby?
[17:05.75]To cancel jump, stop moving before releasing A. Okay, well, I... I just grabbed something.
[17:13.93]I just grabbed, like, a stick.
[17:15.03]Alright, I got a stick in my hands, I'm ready to fight.
[17:17.61]Growing Neuron.
[17:25.67]Are the- Who are these people?
[17:27.29]Are these friends?
[17:31.28]Alright, it said we won't tell you anything, so I just have flowers in my hand.
[17:38.90]What am I supposed to be doing?
[17:40.84]Look at all these things.
[17:42.40]Okay, what about over here?
[17:45.76]Don't know what this is.
[17:47.70]My intelligence is gaining.
[17:49.72]Because I looked over here at the briar patch.
[17:52.10]I know what that is now, apparently.
[17:53.54]Hold on.
[18:05.12]Is that the baby?
[18:06.14]Crying?
[18:09.72]Tap X to use your senses to help you locate any member of your clan.
[18:13.26]Okay.
[18:17.39]Down there.
[18:19.29]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[18:25.67]I'm coming to save you!
[18:28.99]That was scary, I'm not gonna lie.
[18:30.19]Alright, how do I get down from here?
[18:40.41]What?
[18:40.69]I couldn't even read that!
[18:42.57]What did it say?
[18:43.17]Spring... Got ya, okay.
[18:53.24]Tap B, then wait for the answers to progressively comfort the kid.
[18:56.98]Lower the temperature.
[18:58.40]Take the time to listen.
[18:59.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[19:14.05]Why are we doing this?
[19:20.94]It's me!
[19:21.34]Oh, thank goodness.
[19:30.62]So that's what- is this me?
[19:31.75]Which one is me?
[19:36.79]Join your clan in the settlement.
[19:38.09]Alright.
[19:39.89]So here's the thing.
[19:40.67]How do you swing and how do you climb?
[19:42.91]The tutorial was on the screen for five seconds.
[19:47.57]Can I look at tutorials?
[19:50.23]Adult, female, single, fertile.
[19:52.01]Okay, hold on.
[19:53.13]Options, controls.
[19:55.17]Intelligence, emotions, concentrations.
[19:58.62]Emotions.
[20:01.12]It didn't tell me anything.
[20:01.88]Okay.
[20:10.41]Alright.
[20:11.57]I don't know how to grab a vine.
[20:12.83]Alright, let's listen.
[20:18.27]Let's see.
[20:18.57]Where was the settlement again?
[20:19.53]Let me zoom in.
[20:22.74]Let me just take a look at some stuff over here.
[20:24.02]What is this?
[20:29.52]You don't know.
[20:30.18]Right.
[20:30.46]Okay.
[20:30.72]I don't... I don't know what's over there.
[20:36.20]Where was my settlement?
[20:40.97]It's up here, right?
[20:42.91]There it is.
[20:43.35]Alright.
[20:43.65]So, get up there.
[20:47.69]Up that way.
[20:50.74]Up this tree.
[20:51.18]Here we go.
[20:54.26]Is this like... Can I jump higher and grab?
[20:58.24]No.
[20:59.08]I have to just hold.
[21:01.22]Mortricity?
[21:02.66]Mortricity?
[21:03.24]How high can I go?
[21:10.00]I wish I knew how to actually hold on to stuff.
[21:16.82]Do you even need to?
[21:17.59]Maybe you don't even need to.
[21:19.15]Alright, I made it.
[21:26.01]Back in the settlement.
[21:38.11]I could do this pretty well.
[21:43.26]Which one's me and which one's the game?
[21:44.76]That was the game.
[21:47.58]What's going on here?
[21:48.64]What's going on?
[21:50.16]Why are we...
[22:12.97]Can your lineage evolve faster than our ancestors did?
[22:16.62]I don't know.
[22:18.48]Can they?
[22:24.74]Avatar's vitality.
[22:25.76]Energy is limited by stamina, is limited by life expectancy.
[22:29.50]Eat well, drink well, and sleep well to maintain a great stamina.
[22:33.40]Avoid injuries and stay on the screen for more than 10 seconds.
[22:40.10]Stop moving to see all the contextual actions offered.
[22:42.63]They vary according to your situation.
[22:45.93]Contextual actions.
[22:49.21]Alright, well.
[22:50.97]Now what do I do?
[22:59.36]Can I drink out of the stream?
[23:02.18]How do you drink?
[23:02.72]Okay, no, that's like, that's the taunt button.
[23:10.07]Wait.
[23:10.41]Hold on.
[23:10.71]There's so many things to look at.
[23:11.87]Hold on.
[23:12.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:15.89]What a... Okay.
[23:17.39]When already discovered, dropped items can be stockpiled with identical items.
[23:20.92]What are you talking about?
[23:22.40]I hit right bumper.
[23:26.30]Fucking minimal HUD.
[23:29.95]Alright, so we can... You grab with A. Hold X to inspect any item you have in the right hand.
[23:37.73]That's good to know.
[23:38.83]What is it?
[23:40.07]How do I know what this is?
[23:40.85]I don't know what it is.
[23:42.57]This is just a green thing to me.
[23:45.86]New food.
[23:47.34]Horsetail.
[23:50.96]How do I eat it?
[23:51.54]Hahaha!
[24:01.70]Mmm, just like corn on the cob.
[24:05.83]Mmm.
[24:07.11]Adaptable metabolism.
[24:08.59]Assimilated nutrients from the vegetal kind of food.
[24:15.14]How much do I have to eat?
[24:16.24]How much green corn do we have to eat?
[24:18.32]Oh, I'm teaching them.
[24:19.32]I get it.
[24:22.59]See?
[24:23.09]Everyone, this is how you eat food.
[24:24.43]You pick it up and you eat it.
[24:32.78]Okay, I learned communication.
[24:33.80]Now I'm going to learn how to talk.
[24:39.82]What else is there?
[24:40.48]Oh, can I eat this, too?
[24:42.38]Is this food?
[24:43.18]Examine.
[24:46.55]What could this be used for?
[24:47.45]What do you think?
[24:50.55]New tool.
[24:52.73]Grass cycad.
[24:54.57]New tool.
[24:55.11]What could I use this with, though?
[24:56.19]How do I use this?
[24:56.73]There's something over there.
[25:02.27]Take a shit in the river.
[25:03.43]I'm glad that's what you want me to do.
[25:05.91]Oh, what's happened?
[25:12.81]What is that?
[25:14.85]Why does he have lasers coming out of his mouth?
[25:16.17]Hold on, wait.
[25:16.55]Come here.
[25:22.08]What's this?
[25:22.96]Something over here?
[25:24.62]New species of fruit?
[25:27.50]What is it?
[25:29.44]Pick it up.
[25:30.04]What am I doing?
[25:32.33]What's in here?
[25:37.09]Why can this be examined?
[25:37.99]Oh, am I drinking?
[25:40.79]How do I drink?
[25:41.43]How do you drink water?
[25:45.52]Examine the water!
[25:46.60]I have to examine it.
[25:50.12]Oh, yes, I can drink this!
[25:52.66]Mmm!
[25:55.64]Aquadulcis Origo.
[25:57.21]Isn't it just... That's not it.
[25:58.31]It's H2O.
[25:58.85]It's hydrogen and oxygen, twice.
[26:05.74]Alright.
[26:07.12]Let's go.
[26:10.90]How do I feed the kid?
[26:15.48]What's this stuff?
[26:16.41]Ooh, berries.
[26:17.37]Are they poisonous?
[26:21.29]Will I know?
[26:22.49]Poisonous berries?
[26:25.05]New food.
[26:25.63]Is this gonna poison me?
[26:36.20]No, I guess we can't eat these.
[26:38.20]We can eat these!
[26:39.44]Guys, we can eat these.
[26:41.14]Come over here, we can eat these berries.
[26:44.64]Although they might be poisonous.
[26:50.59]Should I not have taught them how to do this?
[26:57.91]Wait, wait, don't eat them!
[26:59.57]Don't eat them!
[27:01.45]Stop eating those!
[27:03.87]I can't be for certain.
[27:04.63]I have to wait until I have diarrhea.
[27:05.88]Okay, something's wrong with me.
[27:07.70]I think I'm cold.
[27:14.54]I'm sorry.
[27:15.82]I think we have to test it somehow.
[27:18.78]Okay?
[27:21.90]Don't eat those.
[27:27.77]Well, whoever that is, we might not last very long.
[27:31.86]What's this?
[27:32.96]Am I going to make a shelter?
[27:33.94]Alright, can I hold it over his head?
[27:36.44]I just gave that to him?
[27:41.18]No, what am I... Having children nearby allows the accumulation of neuronal energy.
[27:51.73]More children means increased accumulation.
[27:56.77]Turn the HUD on.
[27:57.73]I don't think I can.
[27:58.39]Oh, fuck.
[28:02.41]Alright, hold on.
[28:02.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:03.89]Vitality.
[28:05.47]Injuring and poisoning.
[28:07.45]Poisoning comes from venom or by eating rotten or green food.
[28:10.87]Or by ingesting of toxic elements.
[28:13.46]When poisoned, find something with medicinal properties.
[28:19.00]Okay.
[28:20.00]So, I've been poisoned.
[28:21.48]Your organism can't assimilate nutrients from all kinds of food right away.
[28:24.52]Some may cause a temporary poisoning.
[28:27.54]You can become omnivorous through neuronal development.
[28:32.25]Okay.
[28:34.63]Attack.
[28:36.29]Hold A to prime dodging, move to dodge, release A at the right time.
[28:42.01]Hold A to prime the counterattack.
[28:44.25]What the fuck do you mean?
[28:45.31]Alright, let's just, let's go look around.
[28:56.07]Everybody get over here.
[28:56.78]Don't be out there.
[29:00.55]A sleeping spot.
[29:01.27]When built, a sleep spot is at the basis of every settlement.
[29:04.51]Tap A to lie down on a sleep spot.
[29:07.59]Wait, let me examine that as a sleep spot.
[29:13.08]There it is.
[29:13.46]Alright, so I got it on the UI now.
[29:15.44]I got it examined.
[29:18.96]Let's see what it does.
[29:22.39]And let's sleep.
[29:31.18]Am I going to bed?
[29:32.54]How long does it take to go to sleep?
[29:42.47]Go to bed.
[29:48.61]Baby... Baby with spontaneous genetic mutation metabolism.
[29:59.07]How do I turn the fucking HUD on?
[30:05.48]I'm sorry.
[30:06.00]That ain't gonna happen.
[30:07.22]This is staying on.
[30:13.21]I'm not gonna play... Let me learn the game first.
[30:16.19]Jesus.
[30:17.39]Alright, let's see.
[30:18.07]So I got... Change general.
[30:22.39]So it's like Path of Exile.
[30:23.41]Okay, so here I am.
[30:26.41]Neuronal growth is complete.
[30:27.73]Assign neuronal energy to initiate a new communication skill.
[30:32.95]Assign Neural Engine to initiate a new motor skill.
[30:36.55]Alright.
[30:38.51]I think I want some motor skills.
[30:43.67]The ability to switch hands with an item is acquired.
[30:46.02]Tap LB to switch hands with an item.
[30:49.08]Nice.
[30:52.50]That has opened up so many more things.
[30:53.78]Alright, um... I can switch hands.
[30:58.00]Wow.
[30:58.40]What a development.
[30:59.14]What about down here?
[31:01.32]Let's do some more communication.
[31:04.26]Okay.
[31:05.14]The ability to gather all clan members is acquired.
[31:07.28]Hold B to gather all clan members and have them follow you.
[31:16.06]Okay.
[31:17.89]This looks huge.
[31:20.73]To launch an evolution, you must be in your clan's active settlement.
[31:24.57]You've passed at least one generation and succeeded in evolutionary feet.
[31:29.31]Okay, so I haven't done that yet.
[31:33.17]Alright, so let's go to... Let's... That's it.
[31:34.67]We slept.
[31:35.49]We now can hold something in our other hand.
[31:40.47]Analyze.

[32:32.51]Thank you Der New Kaiser for the 10 community subs.
[32:36.46]Thank you.
[32:37.74]Appreciate it.
[32:38.16]Alright, how do I pick you up?
[32:41.84]Isn't this my baby?
[32:42.56]Sleep.
[32:53.43]Sleep!
[32:57.31]Why is the time going so fast?
[33:03.70]What is that?
[33:04.34]Am I having a dream?
[33:07.04]Oh yeah, yesterday I looked at my hand.
[33:09.56]I have something outside of my arm that looks weird.
[33:12.50]It's got five things on it.
[33:19.96]Dawn.
[33:20.54]Alright, let's get up at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[33:22.28]Here we go.
[33:24.04]Food, water, daily regimen update.
[33:25.82]I need some water.
[33:26.42]Alright, let's go.
[33:34.26]Everybody come over here.
[33:34.84]Let's all drink water, please.
[33:37.60]Everybody come over into the pond.
[33:40.06]Let's drink some water.
[33:44.98]All of you, come on.
[33:46.62]Together.
[33:49.06]Over here, all of you.
[33:49.78]See?
[33:49.86]How much is too much water?
[34:04.88]We don't want to get over-hydrated.
[34:06.18]Alright, that's good.
[34:09.82]What about food?
[34:10.40]How am I doing on food?
[34:14.80]Handling.
[34:15.28]Tap to switch hand.
[34:17.03]It will free the right hand to pick up something else.
[34:19.07]Alright, here we go.
[34:22.15]Alter.
[34:22.45]What do you mean, alter?
[34:24.05]Oh, right.
[34:26.85]Some items may be altered with bare hands or crafted.
[34:30.37]What?
[34:35.20]What am I doing?
[34:42.59]Oh, I'm picking the leaves off!
[34:46.87]Alright, Dexterity.
[34:59.74]Okay, let's try that again.
[35:01.48]Should I do that again?
[35:08.89]How many times should I do this?
[35:09.89]Is there any more leaves to pull?
[35:27.75]This has to do something eventually, right?
[35:37.19]I don't know what this is even for.
[35:38.47]What's this for?
[35:48.36]I don't understand.
[35:49.00]I don't know.
[35:51.82]We need food.
[35:52.34]Food.
[35:52.60]Food.
[35:52.82]Follow me.
[35:53.16]Everybody follow me.
[35:53.68]We gotta get food.

[36:37.77]How about, what's that?
[36:41.15]Identify.
[36:43.59]Memorize.
[36:46.62]The location of anything you have identified can be memorized.
[36:50.98]There we go.
[36:51.72]Intelligence can also be used to discover practical items and to visualize the things you have identified.
[36:57.62]Nice.
[36:57.98]Alright, so that stays.
[36:58.80]That's so much better.
[37:02.13]So what's in here?
[37:05.35]I memorized this.
[37:20.72]I don't understand.
[37:21.90]Alright, I'm going.

[47:43.45]Why did I just do that?
[47:49.06]Oh shit, it's getting late.
[47:49.90]All I've done is hit stuff with rocks.
[47:55.83]Hitting.

[48:36.25]Ooh.
[48:38.52]EU has an increased capacity to metabolize food.
[48:43.12]Let's get it.
[48:50.39]Item manipulation.
[48:51.19]The ability to switch an item from one hand to the other while moving is acquired.
[48:55.37]So I can... That's... Who cares?
[48:57.19]I can switch hands while moving.
[49:03.26]That... Who gives a shit?
[49:06.20]Well, we can keep going.
[49:16.96]Now what?
[49:19.62]Once connected, it would be possible to drop an item while moving.
[49:22.36]Alright, well, connect it.
[49:28.85]What are you doing?
[49:29.41]Why can't it go that far?
[49:30.67]Why can't my... I don't have enough brain power?
[49:35.55]Okay, well, I can do things while moving now.
[49:39.49]I think that's all I can do.
[49:40.47]Alright, let's sleep.
[49:43.21]Everybody go to bed.
[49:44.22]Goodnight.
[49:45.56]We have to... We gotta move to a new settlement, right?
[49:50.79]There's only day three.
[49:53.85]Oop.
[49:55.11]We're learning... How to stand... How to rest.
[50:02.16]How to... We're doing charades.
[50:03.60]Um, okay.
[50:05.34]Uh, sleeping.
[50:06.56]Uh, tired.
[50:09.12]I need... Especially... I need to... Wait, wait, wait.
[50:10.76]Okay, here, here, here.
[50:13.44]Water.
[50:14.33]Really?
[50:15.97]There's water right here.
[50:16.73]Why is everybody so fucking thirsty?
[50:21.72]Everybody over here.
[50:24.68]He's holding a stick.
[50:26.46]Have you figured out what to do with the stick yet?
[50:27.98]I don't know what to do.
[50:38.11]You need to drink the water.
[50:39.71]This is not drinking water, is it?
[50:45.45]He's going to become the alpha.
[50:47.39]No, he's not.
[50:49.56]I'll do some diabolical villain shit where if it looks like he's starting to pass me, I'll just fucking put, I'll just, I'll just like cut his vines on when he's swinging around.
[51:11.67]That's fucking diabolical.
[51:13.35]Let me go, I'm gonna go explore.
[51:16.47]Are we well fed?
[51:17.80]I think we are.
[51:21.28]He's figuring... Uh-oh.
[51:22.84]I think I... No, no, no.
[51:23.78]I think here's what happened.
[51:25.59]I handed him that stick yesterday.
[51:28.81]And he still doesn't know what to do with it.
[51:30.45]Let me show him.
[51:31.17]Look.
[51:31.43]Ready?
[51:32.47]Look at me.
[51:33.13]Look, look, look.
[51:33.75]Look at me.
[51:34.27]Look at my eyes.
[51:34.89]Look at me.
[51:37.36]Get a rock.
[51:39.24]You got a stick, too?
[51:40.04]They're all holding sticks.
[51:41.38]Alright.
[51:41.66]We need rocks.
[51:50.64]What's this?
[51:51.96]No.
[51:53.94]Oh, just hold on.
[51:54.86]I know what I'm doing.
[51:55.88]I'm the fucking alpha.
[52:06.03]I need a rock.
[52:13.25]Where's a rock?
[52:14.33]Did you guys hoard the rocks?
[52:15.55]Alright, I'm going for it.
[52:16.27]Let's go.
[52:20.09]What do we got?
[52:20.53]We have some points of interest.
[52:23.85]Nothing too... No, no, no.
[52:24.57]You know what?
[52:24.99]I'm going to do this first.
[52:25.77]Let's focus in on this.
[52:28.75]What is that?
[52:29.21]Okay, that's just grass.
[52:31.40]I don't even know that.
[52:33.54]What about over here?
[52:39.76]It's just grass.
[52:40.58]Don't need to memorize it.
[52:41.52]It's the same shit we had already.
[52:44.75]Anything else?
[52:45.21]There's water.
[52:46.11]What about down here?
[52:46.71]What's that?
[52:47.09]I don't know what that is.
[52:51.11]We're going to find out.
[52:59.00]What is it?
[53:02.18]Look at it.
[53:08.02]Scoop.
[53:08.44]No, no, no.
[53:08.84]Look.
[53:09.02]I want you to look at the patches.
[53:13.88]Phylactery Lich just gave $50.
[53:18.52]Thank you for the 50 bucks, Phylactery.
[53:21.80]I can't wait for Jerma to extinct the human rice by shoving every food he finds directly in his mouth.
[53:25.59]I'm not gonna do that.
[53:26.13]Don't worry.
[53:29.55]How do I look at this?
[53:35.93]How do I examine it?
[53:38.58]But thanks for the 50 fucking dollars, dude.
[53:40.06]Seriously.
[53:42.74]On top of the insane amount of money you've already given.
[53:46.15]Don't fall.
[53:47.76]What's that?
[53:48.12]What was that?
[53:55.66]Do I need... I need to, like, hit this with a... Alright, don't fall down the waterfall.
[53:58.82]To, like, you know, laugh out loud he fell down the waterfall.
[54:01.20]I'm not going to do that.
[54:01.84]Let's look at this one more time.
[54:04.98]They're throwing... They're throwing branches.
[54:06.50]Yeah, well, they're on the mini-map.
[54:09.49]Okay.
[54:12.23]I'm going over here.
[54:15.74]Memorize it.
[54:16.74]Remember it.
[54:18.10]Pay attention to it.
[54:18.88]How do you climb?
[54:22.67]It's important for me to know how to climb.
[54:24.31]Because it was on the screen for five seconds and it was off.
[54:27.41]Alright, so movement.
[54:30.35]Swinging and jumping.
[54:31.13]Stop moving left stick before releasing A to cancel a jump.
[54:35.71]Left stick to swing.
[54:36.78]Hold A to prime a jump.
[54:38.60]Release A to jump.
[54:40.59]Jump then hold A to grab foliage or the creepers when passing through it.
[54:43.29]So you just hold A, and then you let go of left stick, and then you let go of A. At... yes.
[54:55.71]I'm not gonna go this way.
[54:57.03]Everyone expects me to do the thing where all the streamer fucking fell down the waterfall and I laughed and it was not funny.
[55:05.70]Not today.
[55:07.46]Today we're going exploring.
[55:09.75]This is sound.
[55:12.75]No, this is smell.
[55:14.28]Something stinks over there.
[55:15.18]Let me take a look.
[55:38.45]Oh my god!
[55:40.27]Okay, we're fine.
[55:43.22]He fell down.
[55:44.34]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[55:47.84]Let me see if there's anything out here.
[55:49.04]Hold on.
[55:49.94]Be careful.
[55:55.29]There's some smelly things over here.
[55:56.53]What am I hearing?
[55:57.15]Something going on on the right side.
[55:59.91]I hear something over there.
[56:06.09]There are some sounds.
[56:10.62]Rock.
[56:12.86]New rock or same... Oops.
[56:22.82]Okay.
[56:23.54]Should I carry the rock in my hand?
[56:25.16]Okay, I'm gonna smash somebody's head with a rock if I see anybody.
[56:27.44]Gotta head that way.
[56:38.52]What's going on?
[56:39.79]What's wrong with me?
[56:41.93]What is that?
[56:45.35]Oh, those are... Those are my... Those are my clan... Something can see me?
[56:49.37]I don't know what can see me right now, but this is freaking me out.
[57:00.22]Smell.
[57:00.92]What do I smell?
[57:05.41]There ain't nothing here.
[57:13.12]That's a rival?
[57:15.08]Is that a rival monkey?
[57:17.16]I don't think it is.
[57:18.24]I think that's one of my friends, isn't it?
[57:20.34]He does have a stick in his hand.
[57:23.04]This is my friend.
[57:24.74]Right?
[57:36.41]There's a snake.
[57:37.67]Where?
[57:39.29]Where is there a snake?
[57:41.35]I don't see a snake!
[57:46.98]Alright, communication upgraded.
[57:58.41]There's no snake.
[57:59.51]We're fine.
[58:00.73]Alright, everybody come with me.
[58:03.95]Follow me, guys.
[58:07.79]We need to get over there.
[58:09.59]And there's berries over here.
[58:20.33]Alright, there it is.
[58:24.16]Berries?
[58:25.20]Is it berries?
[58:34.48]That was fucking close.
[58:36.98]Alright, we're almost there.
[58:41.20]I need to get some vantage so I can take a look around.
[58:44.78]There's a new tree up here or something.
[58:49.49]This is new.
[58:50.35]Alright, guys.
[58:53.54]New.
[58:55.10]Everybody up.
[58:56.98]Take it.
[58:57.48]Smell it.
[58:58.36]Get it in your hands.
[59:00.12]Alert.
[59:00.68]Alert.
[59:01.10]Alert.
[59:01.52]Alert.
[59:01.78]Why is there an alert?
[59:10.95]It's a pig.
[59:14.37]Oh, shit.
[59:15.67]Somebody get a rock.
[59:18.39]Anybody have a rock?
[59:20.23]I do.
[59:21.81]No, give me the rock.
[59:25.77]Do I have the rock?
[59:28.47]No, give me the... Okay, I got a rock.
[59:29.99]Where'd he go?
[59:35.27]Here, uh... I think we're okay.
[59:39.99]I need to examine this shit, though.
[59:43.05]This is something new.
[59:45.66]Is it edible?
[59:50.58]New food.
[59:52.38]Cut.
[59:53.76]Eat it.
[59:54.16]Wait, no, no, no.
[59:56.36]Don't eat it yet.
[59:56.98]Let me test it.
[60:00.86]Is it good?
[60:01.24]Alright, we've all eaten.
[60:22.38]Should I chop the tree down?
[60:31.47]Oh, no, you guys don't eat it all.
[60:42.38]Okay, analyze.
[60:44.50]I now know what that looks like.
[60:45.66]Let's stand still.
[60:48.37]Let's smell.
[60:50.31]No, that's where I want to go.
[60:51.93]Let's smell, though.
[60:52.61]Let's just make sure.
[60:53.15]I'm not missing anything.
[60:59.13]Listening for something, too.
[61:01.31]Oh, I can hear you guys.
[61:02.03]Stop screaming.
[61:02.59]Alright, we're good.
[61:04.41]Maybe one more for the road?
[61:08.34]Kill the pig.
[61:10.52]We don't know how to use weapons.
[61:13.61]I can barely teach these guys how to throw a rock.
[61:15.53]I don't know anything else.
[61:17.63]No, the mission is still the same.
[61:19.93]Get to this question mark.
[61:22.41]Identify it.
[61:23.25]Memorize it.
[61:24.55]Get over there.
[61:25.64]There's something over there we need to investigate on.
[61:27.78]Alright, easy.
[61:28.32]Here we go.
[61:28.72]Hello?
[61:40.66]Hello?
[61:44.42]Is that guy on my team?
[61:45.10]I think he is.
[61:48.64]Alright, this is where the baby was.
[61:54.84]Anything else we need to see over here?
[61:55.96]Oh, wait.
[61:59.50]Might as well take a look at it.
[62:00.52]Get it in your brain.
[62:02.58]This is a hiding place.
[62:10.62]What?
[62:17.19]Hello?
[62:19.19]Is it above us?
[62:22.63]Where is it?
[62:31.52]Is it over there?
[62:33.94]Where is this thing?
[62:49.92]Whatever it is, it's that way.
[62:53.90]What is it?
[62:54.28]Is it a snake?
[63:10.49]It's a snake!
[63:17.49]Kill it!
[63:18.47]Kill the snake!
[63:21.23]Fight it!
[63:21.63]Uh-oh.
[63:25.35]Hold A to prime dodging.
[63:27.11]Move left stick to choose direction.
[63:28.37]Release at the right time.
[63:34.63]No!
[63:35.45]Okay.
[63:38.57]I'm poisoned.
[63:41.60]Drink water.
[63:44.68]Intimidate!
[63:49.09]Why did I chase it?
[63:49.89]I don't know, because I figured we were all gonna fucking stomp him!
[64:00.10]Drink it!
[64:02.86]Drink the water!
[64:04.66]Drink the water, please!
[64:07.00]Drink the water!
[64:08.54]Oh god, I need a healing plant.
[64:13.13]Somebody help, please!
[64:15.63]Medicinal?
[64:16.75]What's that?
[64:19.54]Hiding spot.
[64:20.20]Nope.
[64:28.58]I need a medicinal plant.
[64:29.54]I don't know what's over there, but let's find out.
[64:33.80]Hurry up.
[64:40.44]Alright, what's this?
[64:44.15]Is this wheat?
[64:45.67]It's wheat!
[64:56.60]New gathering spot.
[64:58.04]Fishing spot.
[64:59.92]No?
[65:00.54]I'm still poisoned.
[65:05.00]What, like, heals poison?
[65:08.02]What?
[65:08.40]What?
[65:08.90]Huh?
[65:09.74]Fear of the unknown.
[65:10.76]Use your senses and intelligence to identify what's around you.
[65:15.02]Fear and dopamine is needed to... Dopamine is needed to avoid hysteria when in fear.
[65:18.90]Whoa!
[65:30.47]Oh fuck, it's another snake!
[65:34.09]Is that the same snake?
[65:36.37]Everybody get over here.
[65:38.88]Strength in numbers.
[65:48.60]Give me that thing.
[65:51.64]Alright, I need... Is the snake still here?
[66:01.41]Alright, I'm out.
[66:02.17]Get up.
[66:02.93]Get up, get up, get up.
[66:03.61]Climb, climb, climb, climb, climb.
[66:04.53]Don't, don't, no, no, no, no.
[66:06.55]What the fuck is that?
[66:08.93]Wait, what?
[66:10.91]I thought it was a snake.
[66:14.80]Oh my god.
[66:16.46]It's a lion.
[66:19.92]Get out of the way.
[66:20.96]Get up on the tree.
[66:22.98]Climb.
[66:23.82]Oh, he's looking at me.
[66:25.36]Why is he looking at me?
[66:26.16]Why is he looking at me?
[66:26.88]Why is he looking at me?
[66:27.50]Why is he looking at me?
[66:29.62]Get up here!
[66:31.68]He can't climb.
[66:32.30]Okay.
[66:32.90]Um.
[66:38.86]What am I supposed to do?
[66:39.90]He can't get up here.
[66:44.78]It's like the three stooges.
[66:48.40]He can't get up.
[66:49.00]He can't get up.
[66:49.48]He can't get up.
[66:49.96]Come on.
[66:50.22]All the way up.
[66:52.24]What's wrong with me?
[66:55.32]Uh.
[66:55.52]Why?
[66:55.86]Where am I going?
[67:01.25]I'm not in control.
[67:03.71]I'm not in control.
[67:35.01]Did I just knock myself out?
[67:39.41]I have no idea.
[67:40.23]Am I still poisoned?
[67:41.32]What happened?
[67:44.96]I hit my fucking head so hard that I cured the poison.
[67:58.04]What is in my hand?
[68:02.34]New food?
[68:04.26]A giant African snail.
[68:10.75]When did I pick up a snail?
[68:19.53]Nutrients from the mollusk kind of food.
[68:29.16]I'm still poisoned.
[68:38.60]God damn it.
[68:39.94]Alright, I need to fight.
[68:42.96]I need to learn how to fight.
[68:44.28]I need to lie down first, I think.
[68:48.19]How did I even get back here?
[68:49.37]I need to lie down.
[69:01.79]I'm gonna sleep off the poison.
[69:09.01]I'm good.
[69:11.17]You died?
[69:11.59]This is a different monkey.
[69:16.85]Why is this one?
[69:17.50]Wait, did we all get bit by the snake or something?
[69:19.68]Wait, this is a diff- This is different.
[69:22.82]Wait a minute, hold on.
[69:24.86]Is this still you?
[69:28.02]Who's on me?
[69:33.33]Why is it felt like- Wait, this is not me?
[69:38.14]Partnered with... Book.
[69:41.40]Oh.
[69:44.62]Okay, so this is not... I can't even, man.
[69:47.16]I need to learn some new abilities.
[69:54.16]There we are.
[69:54.74]Alright, you're supposed to just die.
[69:56.62]Because there's no way you're going to survive.
[69:58.25]Alright, handling.
[70:00.89]What about what just opened up down here?
[70:03.77]More... More communication.
[70:06.74]Self-empowerment.
[70:07.66]Once connected, clan members will have the capacity to automatically mimic an intimidation or the action of conquering fear.
[70:14.62]Get down there.
[70:16.89]I need you guys to be independent.
[70:25.43]Good.
[70:27.18]Alright, what about this generation?
[70:28.20]To pass generation, you must be an adult, be in your clan's active settlement, and the clan must have at least one kid.
[70:36.39]Okay, so we need... We got more shit here to do.
[70:39.28]So this is generational.
[70:43.58]Switch an item from... So this means that new... Wait, does this person not know how to do anything?
[70:56.59]Shit, okay.
[70:59.09]Generational.
[71:00.15]Item manipulation.
[71:04.35]So what am I... This is reinforce.
[71:14.87]So, the new monkeys will know that.
[71:19.81]So, this is ensuring that the next generation will know.
[71:22.41]Okay.
[71:24.68]I mean, that's fairly important, I think.
[71:28.10]Alright, let's go.
[71:28.62]We need to go to sleep.
[71:32.14]This time, I ain't gonna do anything until I fucking learn how to make, like, a weapon.
[71:51.72]Why am I having a dream of the hyenas?
[71:56.42]Alright, it's 8 a.m.
[71:57.12]Let's go.
[71:58.76]We're good.
[71:59.32]Sleep, food, water.
[72:00.50]Everyone's healthy.
[72:03.12]Let's get this going.
[72:08.58]I was on an expedition.
[72:09.58]We're not going to do... It's too dangerous.
[72:16.40]Where is my stuff?
[72:17.52]I have like a rock over here.
[72:18.76]Where's my grinding rock?
[72:20.78]I'm going to build a little thing first.
[72:24.14]Here's a rock.
[72:25.54]Give me a stick.
[72:32.54]Stick.
[72:34.02]Of some sort.
[72:34.72]Something like that.
[72:35.48]Here we go.
[72:40.14]Drop the babies?
[72:41.00]I get extra points if I have a baby with me.
[72:44.82]Let's alter it.
[72:53.22]What the hell?
[73:01.66]Shit, I missed the opportunity.
[73:02.60]Hold on.
[73:02.90]Alright, alter it.
[73:14.43]New stripping.
[73:16.61]Okay.
[73:18.41]Grass can be modified.
[73:19.89]Alright, now take a look at that.
[73:22.67]What do you think about this?
[73:26.57]Can I hit somebody with this thing, maybe?
[73:27.85]Okay.
[73:32.66]Stem.
[73:34.84]Stem and... I don't know.
[73:38.30]Just eat it.
[73:41.74]Enchanted.
[73:42.74]Now can I do something with the rock?
[73:49.09]Okay.
[73:54.93]No.
[73:56.77]Um... You've made a butt scratcher.
[73:59.28]That's not gonna do anything.
[74:07.84]I need to... I need, like, leaves.
[74:15.55]I need... Give me... I need a... Ah!
[74:17.55]Come here.
[74:18.65]Put my stuff over here.
[74:19.51]I need one of those sticks.
[74:27.08]Give me the rock.
[74:29.42]I'm going to make a stick and then I'm going to take the stone and I'm going to make something else with it.
[74:37.13]Smash it up.
[74:41.19]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[74:42.31]Don't throw it.
[74:43.47]Don't.
[74:45.57]I had to let go and it's gone.
[74:47.13]That was obsidian.
[74:48.13]I don't know where it is now.
[74:58.88]Okay, so there we go.
[74:59.64]I don't even need the rock anymore.
[75:02.86]Well, I do now.
[75:03.46]Okay, so you can just strip it.
[75:06.54]Now what happens if I take an obsidian rock... And I smash them together?
[75:17.41]I'm sharpening the end.
[75:20.37]Just learned how to make a weapon.
[75:23.07]And I'm gonna make, like, fu-
[75:44.13]Who died?
[75:50.02]OK.
[75:50.38]Well, I don't know.
[75:51.86]It just happens.
[76:03.13]Come on.
[76:05.16]Come on.
[76:05.64]Keep it going.
[76:17.16]New alteration.
[76:19.14]An obsidian can alter a stick.
[76:21.60]And now this stick can be used.
[76:25.01]Use the obsidian as a tool at least twice.
[76:28.25]Switch up the hands.
[76:29.47]Take a look at the weapon.
[76:31.03]And learn.
[76:32.35]Pointy means pain.
[76:34.43]Ow.
[76:35.05]Sharp.
[76:36.29]Blood.
[76:39.01]Sharpened stick.
[76:41.24]Good.
[76:46.35]I now have a weapon.
[76:50.89]I am ready.
[76:52.48]I am gonna actually give this to you.
[76:56.08]Come here.
[76:57.98]I want you to take this.
[77:04.18]Learn.
[77:05.70]Take that.
[77:06.06]Why is everybody choking?
[77:10.80]Here.
[77:12.17]Take this item.
[77:14.01]Good.
[77:14.73]Now you have the pointy stick.
[77:16.81]And we're gonna make like three of these.
[77:18.85]He's dying.
[77:19.55]He's not dying.
[77:24.48]Oh, I'm eating bugs.
[77:32.34]What happens when I get this to level two?
[77:43.47]Alright, couple.
[77:48.38]A couple?
[77:54.28]Should we make some more children?
[77:55.58]Wow, I have two... I feel like there's two kids on me.
[77:58.89]Okay, um... Ig.
[78:03.99]Coupled with Klu.
[78:06.55]Alright.
[78:08.18]Good.
[78:08.38]Make sure you take that stick with you.
[78:12.54]You're gonna be fine.
[78:13.28]Stop, like, what are you choking on?
[78:15.59]Analyze.
[78:19.19]Yeah, you're fine.
[78:24.57]Alright.
[78:26.53]We're gonna make babies, you and I. Here, eat this.
[78:41.35]Eat it.
[78:43.55]Well, never mind.
[78:44.21]Here.
[78:44.57]Somebody else eat this.
[78:46.92]Alright, now it's time.
[78:47.82]I'm going to make a couple more sticks.
[78:50.58]We need to have some... Some form of defense.
[78:53.98]I'm not going to walk around the jungle without anything.
[79:05.28]It's that.
[79:06.98]Grab the rock.
[79:08.18]Let's make another sharp stick.
[79:18.48]Do the rock and obsidian next.
[79:22.66]You don't know how to use them.
[79:24.50]Can I just, like, stab somebody with this so we know what happens?
[79:34.81]Like, I can't just walk into somebody with this and just stab them with, like, the chest.
[79:42.03]And everyone would be like...
[79:45.53]And they'll know that it does that.
[79:48.40]Oh my god, I'm a fucking idiot.
[80:02.74]No, no, put this down.
[80:18.26]Water.
[80:21.06]Why am I afraid of the water?
[80:22.10]Does phobias get passed down from generation to generation in this game?
[80:28.30]Okay.
[80:42.77]I'm good.
[80:44.19]Got a stick.
[80:51.97]Put this down.
[80:55.13]No, put the stick down, because I need to drink water.
[80:57.11]Alright, everybody get over here!
[81:03.65]Water, guys!
[81:09.48]Everybody in!
[81:14.86]Look what I'm doing!
[81:16.12]Do what I'm doing!
[81:18.51]Why you have to... Food, water, didn't we learn this already?
[81:26.94]Everybody in the water, follow me in here.
[81:32.04]In the water.
[81:34.21]In the water.
[81:43.25]You can do it.
[81:46.35]Very good.
[81:48.25]All of you now.
[81:49.05]I know, but I'm going to move because you're not going to do it.
[81:51.57]In here.
[81:52.75]Get in the water.
[82:00.79]Why won't he come in the water?
[82:04.36]Look.
[82:08.44]Do I need to teach you everything?
[82:10.42]Yes, apparently I do.
[82:11.34]Do we even have any more food?
[82:14.05]Stab him!
[82:15.17]No, I need to... Okay, I need... Where's my food?
[82:18.12]Where's food?
[82:19.10]Hold on.
[82:24.78]There's like... There's food over here, right?
[82:26.82]Right here.
[82:29.72]Come here.
[82:32.14]Everybody over here right now!
[82:45.26]I'm going blind?
[82:46.36]What?
[82:46.56]Eat it.
[83:00.73]Good job.
[83:01.57]Finally.
[83:11.25]Can we drink in here now?
[83:17.20]Good.
[83:18.74]I can't... I cannot have... I can't have sex right now, guys.
[83:25.98]Alright.
[83:28.72]You got a stick.
[83:29.36]I got a stick.
[83:29.94]That should be good.
[83:31.42]Everyone's eaten.
[83:32.02]Everyone's drank.
[83:32.68]Let's go.
[83:35.24]Where's my stick?
[83:41.45]There it is.
[83:42.59]Give me my stick.
[83:47.54]I don't know how to use it, but I might be able to accidentally hit something with this.
[83:51.04]Alright, let's try this again.
[83:55.77]I want to go somewhere close.
[83:58.27]I don't know what this is, but I... Wait a minute.
[84:00.25]Hold on.
[84:00.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:01.61]Can I hit it?
[84:02.95]I think I can hit this with a stick.
[84:04.39]Let me try.
[84:04.71]Use the stick on here.
[84:11.22]Come on.
[84:14.58]Come on.
[84:15.22]You know you want to do it.
[84:16.22]Swing the stick.
[84:24.49]Ow.
[84:25.17]Damn it.
[84:25.59]I thought I could just whack it.
[84:27.89]I can't hit.
[84:33.16]Damn it.
[84:38.68]Alright, we need to go to bed.
[84:45.33]Try to hit a tree.
[84:49.13]Hold on.
[84:50.43]Let me see if I have any more evolution points left.
[84:54.19]I do want to do this.
[84:56.73]See if I can reach it.
[84:59.23]Is there enough points?
[85:02.03]Yes, there is.
[85:02.75]Thank God.
[85:03.21]You can drop an item while moving is acquired.
[85:07.15]Good.
[85:12.17]Now that opened up something over here.
[85:15.65]Need more dexterity.
[85:18.47]Motor skills.
[85:19.49]Growth potential for reflexes.
[85:21.05]More training is needed.
[85:23.77]Motive skills.
[85:24.41]Potentially the ability to build.
[85:25.99]I have to, like, just bring trees and branches and shit over there.
[85:34.13]Alright.
[85:34.67]Lie down.
[85:35.35]Sleep.
[85:36.23]I'm getting up at 5 AM and we're going out.
[85:46.58]Put down the children.
[85:48.62]The children give me bonus points.
[85:59.12]Ability to breathe while walking has been unlocked.
[86:02.40]Yeah, something like that.
[86:04.10]Somebody else is dead.
[86:04.90]How are there people dying?
[86:06.32]Were those people that were still out in the wild?
[86:11.78]Okay, I've got my- we got two spears!
[86:16.20]It's you!
[86:20.52]How did you die?
[86:25.36]Why are we just dropping like flies?
[86:31.98]I don't understand.
[86:32.72]Analyzing the corpse of a friend generates energy as for other actions.
[86:43.00]Use it for evolution while resting on it.
[86:44.34]Okay, I just got points for looking at it.
[86:47.28]Dead for zero years.
[86:48.40]How do I, like, get rid of them?
[86:51.84]This is gonna attract predators.
[87:05.72]Alright, I'm doing something else.
[87:07.90]Everybody over here, eat.
[87:11.12]Come here.
[87:14.10]Everybody eat.
[87:15.20]Everybody drink.
[87:23.83]Use corpse as a training dummy.
[87:25.03]That's not going to work.
[87:34.22]You need to survive.
[87:35.12]We need meat to survive.
[87:37.10]We don't need to eat meat to survive.
[87:40.38]The real question I have is, why can I not break this stuff?
[87:42.92]We've eaten all the stuff over here.
[87:44.24]We need more food.
[87:45.11]This settlement is done.
[87:53.61]We've eaten everything here.
[88:00.34]Follow my lead.
[88:02.12]I need building points.
[88:03.36]Hold on.
[88:11.19]Do what I do.
[88:13.50]Pick.
[88:14.66]Do what I do.
[88:16.38]Drop.
[88:17.70]Right over here.
[88:18.38]You can do it.
[88:20.96]No, no, no.
[88:21.30]Hold on.
[88:26.03]And then I'm gonna burn this.
[88:26.95]Okay.
[88:31.97]Start construction.
[88:50.10]Ooh.
[88:51.31]I just figured it out.
[88:52.59]Various construction can improve your settlement.
[88:57.35]There you go.
[88:59.27]I just did it.
[89:02.83]Alright.
[89:03.77]I deserve some water for that one.
[89:08.73]I got my weapon.
[89:12.06]I am going to go.
[89:13.30]We need to find some more food or something.
[89:19.28]What is that?
[89:22.86]Let's go take a look.
[89:24.55]Can I... I can't hit this.
[89:31.95]No.
[89:32.69]I can't break it.
[89:34.07]Even with a stick.
[89:34.69]I don't... My... Ow.
[89:37.16]My, like, brain doesn't understand.
[89:38.44]I'm gonna climb up here.
[89:48.98]What we got up here?
[89:49.60]Anything new?
[89:53.90]Yeah?
[89:58.90]Looks like it.
[89:59.42]Alright, I'm gonna get this.
[90:02.42]No snakes and shit, right?
[90:03.46]What is this?
[90:03.84]New stuff?
[90:06.89]What is that?
[90:09.23]What is this?
[90:12.05]Food!
[90:16.69]Found the food tree!
[90:19.63]Eat up!
[90:34.10]Now, I need to get... What the hell do I need?
[90:45.21]Nothing there... Are you eating?
[90:50.91]Smell.
[90:51.80]Anything smell?
[90:54.56]That's... Something down there smells.
[90:58.40]I'm going that way.
[91:00.80]Can I inspect it?
[91:01.36]I think I've already... This is the... I've already inspected this, I think.
[91:04.85]Where's the... Other clan members?
[91:07.69]Especially... Where's the one with the spear?
[91:11.77]No, you're down there.
[91:12.27]Okay.
[91:12.80]Let's go.
[91:20.50]I'm going to be careful this time.
[91:26.72]I really don't want to fuck this up.
[91:29.22]I need to discover something.
[91:30.31]Smell.
[91:37.33]Up top, many apples.
[91:44.52]What's over there?
[91:45.26]I get something that way.
[91:47.70]In there.
[91:48.32]Something smells.
[91:49.00]I'm staying up in the trees.
[91:50.24]I ain't gonna get fucking killed up there.
[91:54.63]I learned new intimidation techniques.
[92:00.23]Got a pit stop right here.
[92:02.67]Easy.
[92:04.97]You got a stick?
[92:05.75]Alright, we both got sticks.
[92:08.17]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[92:10.07]I'm fine.
[92:16.78]That was just barely not enough to get hurt.
[92:19.40]What is that?
[92:20.09]Ooh!
[92:23.63]A new thing?
[92:24.25]Nope, that's... I know what that is.
[92:27.95]A hiding spot?
[92:28.65]Okay.
[92:29.49]I know what that is.
[92:34.08]Another hiding spot?
[92:39.38]Don't know what that is.
[92:41.12]Let's check that out first.
[92:43.52]Memorize that.
[92:44.36]Remember it.
[92:45.08]Burn it in your brain.
[92:45.68]Let's go.
[92:47.87]Okay, let's make our way down here.
[92:49.13]I'm gonna go up.
[92:54.40]Can I climb this?
[93:00.14]Climb the moss over here, right?
[93:05.72]You can do that.
[93:07.92]How can you not do that?
[93:14.92]Got it.
[93:16.52]This way!
[93:28.68]Have I seen this before?
[93:33.21]Is this new?
[93:33.65]I don't think this is new.
[93:37.85]No, it's not.
[93:38.17]Just want to make sure this is not something new.
[93:44.41]Nope, but it smells good.
[93:45.15]Eat it.
[93:53.55]Get over here.
[93:55.09]Come on.
[94:00.51]Well, I'm trying.
[94:02.05]Whatever.
[94:02.68]Let's go.
[94:05.50]Where was the thing that I wanted to inspect over here?
[94:07.08]Oh, it was down here.
[94:09.54]Okay, right there.
[94:11.84]Ran it in rock.
[94:15.64]Ran it in rock.
[94:17.82]Don't need that.
[94:18.58]What the fuck is that?
[94:25.76]Unknown.
[94:27.04]There looks like there's predator faces over there, though.
[94:31.58]Is that a snake or something?
[94:40.91]More food.
[94:44.37]Are those mine?
[94:45.55]Are those my monkey friends?
[94:47.19]Yeah, they are.
[94:49.33]Okay.
[94:50.69]I'm going over there.
[94:51.49]Is it a beehive?
[94:56.80]Somebody's choking.
[94:59.48]What's that?
[95:01.67]Do you hear that?
[95:11.44]Who's choking?
[95:29.73]I don't know, he's choking.
[95:35.56]That is a beehive.
[95:36.30]I'm gonna get the honey.
[95:37.52]I gotta go, I gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[95:47.72]Found it!
[95:48.16]It's right here.
[95:59.14]I got it.
[95:59.74]What is it?
[96:02.34]How do I take it?
[96:03.00]Okay, I gotta let go of this.
[96:27.34]Somebody is still choking.
[96:29.62]I donut.
[96:30.78]Why?
[96:31.42]I died donut.
[96:33.45]Okay, I got my right hand is free.
[96:35.99]Here we go.
[96:36.41]Grab?
[96:37.07]Should I grab the beehive?
[96:44.31]It's bees?
[96:49.75]Kapok fiber.
[96:55.96]What do I do with this?
[97:08.37]Alright, who- who is at- what do I do with this?
[97:14.99]Alright, easy.
[97:18.16]Smash it.
[97:21.62]Apply.
[97:26.00]What am I- it's like soap?
[97:32.65]Uh, okay, it's- I cli- it's- I learned how to bathe like a fucking beehive.
[97:39.44]What's next?
[97:41.38]Find a new spot that we haven't seen.
[97:42.56]There is a snake over there.
[97:45.31]I am fucking around.
[97:46.35]This is what I wanted to look at.
[97:47.25]What's over here?
[97:48.99]Okay, we know what those do.
[97:53.55]Let's get some drink.
[97:55.83]While we have a minute.
[97:58.14]Food.
[97:59.12]There's a snake over here.
[97:59.72]There's a snake over here somewhere.
[98:01.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[98:02.08]Where's the snake?
[98:02.50]I'm not gonna fucking die again.
[98:03.30]Where is it?
[98:10.66]Giant warthog.
[98:12.86]Where is there a giant warthog?
[98:16.32]We work together.
[98:22.24]Got it.
[98:22.56]Intimidated the warthog.
[98:23.32]We have sticks and shit.
[98:24.48]I would be scared too, wouldn't you?
[98:29.64]I don't even know where they were.
[98:33.44]He saw the stick.
[98:36.08]Alright, now let's go back down here.
[98:37.29]Let's make sure there's nothing here.
[98:42.14]I don't see anything.
[98:42.94]What about here?
[98:43.62]Any?
[98:46.10]No.
[98:46.48]Let's eat.
[98:53.64]Alright, good.
[99:02.77]Let's drink some water.
[99:05.95]On our voyage.
[99:06.57]I need to put the stick down.
[99:11.92]I don't like that though.
[99:16.60]Maybe I should give the stick to somebody else.
[99:27.17]Come on in and drink.
[99:35.57]He's drinking mud water.
[99:39.15]Give that person the stick.
[99:42.94]I'm using my two children.
[99:47.76]No, I'm not.
[99:48.81]I'm not using the kids as armor.
[99:51.57]I'm getting extra points for being here.
[100:02.32]What?
[100:03.28]What is it?
[100:03.64]What is it?
[100:03.92]What is it?
[100:04.28]Snake!
[100:04.58]Snake!
[100:04.86]Snake!
[100:05.12]Snake!
[100:05.38]Snake!
[100:06.82]Intimidate!
[100:08.30]Together!
[100:17.99]Should I go and stab the snake?
[100:19.89]Nope.
[100:21.13]Intimidate.
[100:21.55]Let's go.
[100:21.95]Together.
[100:26.25]That's right.
[100:26.85]Fuck off.
[100:30.43]Alright.
[100:32.31]Now throw javelin style into the snake.
[100:38.65]That's right.
[100:39.07]We got two sticks.
[100:40.25]And our crew.
[100:40.75]You don't want to fuck with us.
[100:43.29]Alright.
[100:43.45]What do we got?
[100:43.83]We got some new stuff over here.
[100:44.91]This is different.
[100:46.03]I don't think I know what this is.
[100:46.89]This is a new item.
[100:51.73]Let's check it out.
[100:57.35]Is it... What's going on?
[100:59.52]Why can I not inspect?
[101:08.43]Fishing spot.
[101:11.43]Huh?
[101:22.63]Oh, shit.
[101:27.91]Did I get one?
[101:28.99]I got one.
[101:30.43]Spearfishing.
[101:31.01]You found a way to get food in a fishing spot.
[101:35.13]Is it a... What is it?
[101:36.06]It's a lobster.
[101:43.00]Nice.
[101:43.40]Alright.
[101:43.98]Do we need to cook food?
[101:45.26]Did our ancestors cook food?
[101:47.48]I think they just ate anything they found on the ground.
[101:54.74]What the hell?
[101:55.84]Oh god, what do I do?
[101:57.66]Why is... Are we just watching like a match?
[102:08.17]Where did that happen?
[102:17.00]He just kind of ran over.
[102:18.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:19.84]I gotta put down my like crawfish weapon.
[102:25.67]Somebody just puked.
[102:27.69]Who just puked?
[102:30.67]How do I eat this?
[102:31.57]No, how do I eat the crawfish?
[102:38.94]How do I eat it?
[102:39.62]I just want to eat the fish.
[102:52.93]Oh, whatever.
[102:53.45]OK, let's go.
[103:00.57]I think that was over here.
[103:01.89]Yep.
[103:02.25]There's all kinds of fucked up shit going on over here.
[103:04.57]Relax, everybody.
[103:05.19]Hold on.
[103:07.03]Don't get too crazy up here.
[103:09.29]Okay.
[103:09.53]There he is.
[103:10.01]There he is.
[103:10.35]There he is.
[103:10.81]There he is.
[103:11.07]There he is.
[103:11.33]What do we do?
[103:11.69]What do we do?
[103:12.05]I don't know what to do.
[103:12.77]I don't know what to do.
[103:13.49]I don't know what to do about this.
[103:14.77]Should we scream at him?
[103:15.73]Should we run?
[103:16.55]I think we've run.
[103:20.64]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[103:21.68]Don't fight.
[103:22.10]Intimidate.
[103:24.26]Yeah, we got sticks.
[103:25.16]It's fine.
[103:33.29]The sticks really do help.
[103:36.61]He's right there.
[103:40.25]Get outta here!
[103:40.91]Run away!
[103:42.48]I wanna get over there!
[103:45.42]He's gonna try to wrap around.
[104:01.79]Inspect the stick?
[104:07.17]I can't take it off.
[104:12.97]Alright, watch out.
[104:20.17]Away from the pig.
[104:27.04]Can we sleep up in a tree?
[104:31.53]Up here, follow me.
[104:34.51]Where are you going?
[104:35.64]Where are you going?
[104:36.46]Where are you going?
[104:38.08]Come on, don't be the one that's left behind.
[104:39.68]Where's number three?
[104:40.96]Number four.
[104:41.94]Alright, we got four, right?
[104:47.87]I'm too stupid to grab with the other hand.
[105:11.26]What's wrong?
[105:11.56]Am I getting gas?
[105:12.60]Am I getting gas for enterological problems?
[105:15.31]That just gave me stomachache.
[105:20.93]Should I not have eaten that?
[105:21.59]Alright, I need a place to sleep.
[105:24.74]We need to go over there.
[105:30.53]Alright, let's go.
[105:44.12]What is it?
[105:44.46]There's something over there.
[105:46.32]Question mark.
[105:48.14]I gotta get up top.
[105:53.25]We need to find a place to hang out before it gets too late.
[105:56.37]I need to sleep.
[106:06.29]Holy shit.
[106:07.44]That would have been so fucking horrible.
[106:08.90]Okay, I'm almost at the... A memorized item has been forgotten.
[106:14.88]What do you mean it's been forgotten?
[106:16.94]How does that make any sense?
[106:20.39]I found the thing that I'm... Why is there a ticking bomb sound?
[106:32.29]Something new.
[106:33.30]Alright, let's...
[106:36.32]Let's make camp over here
[106:48.04]No, we don't.
[106:48.40]No, we don't.
[106:48.72]Don't make camp over here.
[106:50.46]Don't make camp.
[106:51.96]Don't make camp over here.
[106:53.86]Don't make camp.
[106:54.38]Hurry up and get up here.
[106:55.52]I don't know what it is.
[106:56.62]I don't know what I'm looking at.
[106:58.72]I hear something.
[106:59.96]There's alligators.
[107:00.56]Alligators.
[107:01.32]Jesus Christ.
[107:04.74]Get up.
[107:05.08]I don't know what to do.
[107:09.44]Hurry up and get up here.
[107:13.34]He's trying to prize.
[107:14.98]Let's help.
[107:16.19]What do we do?
[107:17.21]Should I stab?
[107:34.62]He was trying to hold his mouth closed.
[107:38.32]Where's the thing I need to get?
[107:39.28]It's ov- where?
[107:39.78]Is it over here?
[107:40.28]This is not the appropriate music for what's happening right now.
[107:46.67]This is like Dora the Explorer music.
[107:53.13]I lost my stick.
[107:56.65]Why did it want me to come over here?
[108:01.73]I need to get up high, and then what's the thing I need to examine for my future generations to know what it is?
[108:08.37]Where is it?
[108:08.77]Is it up there?
[108:31.06]I don't even fucking understand what the hell this wants me to do.
[108:35.47]Alright.
[108:39.01]I'm dying.
[108:39.61]How do I stop bleeding?
[108:40.43]How do I fix my bone?
[108:43.81]How do I fix my bones?
[108:44.53]I don't know how to fix the... I don't have no idea.
[108:47.29]I think... You're alive still.
[108:49.51]Okay, you need to take... You're gonna take everybody.
[108:54.31]Here, take... Take the kids.
[108:55.89]Take the kids.
[108:56.27]Take the kids.
[108:56.67]Take the kids.
[108:57.69]How do I put the kids down?
[108:58.59]Take the kids.
[109:01.69]No, take the kids.
[109:02.87]Forget about this stuff.
[109:04.57]Take the kids.
[109:18.77]I need to eat something and just sit.
[109:25.79]Good luck.
[109:26.17]There's a hiding spot over there.
[109:27.95]There's a crocodile right below me.
[109:31.00]Oh, he's dead.
[109:45.85]I couldn't even hand off the kids.
[109:52.27]Here we go again.
[109:53.05]Okay, what are you gonna do now?
[109:59.70]He's just... He's following me up.
[110:06.65]He's like, slow down.
[110:07.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[110:09.21]It's not worth it.
[110:10.05]You don't have to be great.
[110:11.41]Just hold on a minute here.
[110:23.73]I think we're still alive.
[110:26.47]We got to the top of the tree and then we somehow made it home.
[110:28.31]I don't know how.
[110:39.24]Okay, well, let's lie down.
[110:40.52]We've unlocked some new things, apparently.
[110:48.01]A cognitive enhancement.
[110:52.79]Once connected, it would be possible to detect more distant elements through the intelligence.
[110:57.97]Okay.
[111:01.13]The ability to detect more distant elements through intelligence is acquired.
[111:04.15]Tap Y to use your intelligence and follow the steps proposed by the contextual actions.
[111:12.51]Did I unlock anything over here?
[111:13.57]Ewe has an increased capacity to metabolize food, but is Ewe even still alive?
[111:18.35]Alright, let's lock in a couple more of these.
[111:24.99]Let's lock that one in.
[111:34.08]And let's lock this one in too.
[111:42.39]Alright, the kids are gonna stay.
[111:50.51]It feels like this game was made without any real premise, just a bunch of ideas.
[111:55.65]Kind of.
[112:04.65]Okay, I'm good.
[112:05.47]Water, sleep, food.
[112:06.57]I don't have any sticks.
[112:09.15]Who's even left in the clan?
[112:11.47]I've got a couple people here.
[112:12.33]Alright, let me try... Give me rock and give me... What about two rocks?
[112:25.50]Do two of these do anything?
[112:29.16]Two obsidian rocks.
[112:32.93]I think there's something here.
[112:34.69]There's something here to explore.
[112:40.77]No.
[112:41.37]Pick it up.
[112:51.82]Pick up the rock.
[112:53.56]Pick up the fucking rock.
[113:01.42]Give me the rock.
[113:02.58]Memorize where the rock is and look at it and pick it up.
[113:06.18]No.
[113:06.52]Is there another one over here?
[113:15.42]I can do something with this too.
[113:20.50]Pick up the rock.
[113:22.80]I could have just picked it up.
[113:23.58]Why can't I pick it up?
[113:25.58]Give me the rock.
[113:27.22]I just saw it.
[113:27.78]I just hit A.
[113:38.44]Fine.
[113:38.86]Take the other one.
[113:44.96]This person is so dead.
[113:46.80]Can I at least move this person out of the way?
[113:48.44]Okay.
[114:07.76]No, I can't pick up the rock because this game suffers from so many games that do this.
[114:11.60]They tie every action to the same button.
[114:30.45]I'm just gonna make it fun.
[114:31.89]Come here.
[114:40.42]I did it!
[114:44.24]Give me a stick.
[114:53.30]Give me this damn thing.
[114:54.22]I need another obsidian rock.
[114:59.80]I ain't gonna find one.
[115:02.66]I have to go looking for a rock.
[115:08.43]Let me- hold on.
[115:08.93]Can I do anything with these two?
[115:11.91]I don't think I can.
[115:13.39]No.
[115:17.75]Make a gun.
[115:19.75]I don't think I have the necessary items.
[115:24.37]Can I not look at this yet?
[115:27.36]I feel like I should be able to examine the briar patch.
[115:29.76]Like, touch it and go, ow!
[115:34.36]Anyways, what's over here?
[115:36.74]Uh, what's happening over there?
[115:37.94]A snake of some sort, maybe?
[115:39.49]Maybe?
[115:43.81]Is it a snake?
[115:45.79]What is going on here?
[115:49.95]Bugs?
[115:51.23]Can you eat bugs?
[115:58.22]What?
[115:58.88]Liftable rock.
[116:00.78]Okay.
[116:03.94]I'm doing it with the stick!
[116:11.15]Come on!
[116:12.95]Use your strength!
[116:15.15]Oh, you idiot.
[116:23.75]I need a better stick?
[116:24.89]A bigger one?
[116:25.43]A stronger stick?
[116:32.41]What do we got over here?
[116:33.15]More stuff to look at?
[116:36.82]He's trying his best.
[116:46.14]Get up there and look!
[116:49.78]Look at it!
[116:52.44]It was just like, ooh, what's this thing over here?
[116:55.36]No, he doesn't care.
[116:59.24]No.
[117:00.67]You don't care.
[117:01.11]He still hasn't figured out that you can touch that.
[117:19.82]Anything else over here that I can do?
[117:21.88]All this shit over there.
[117:26.90]He's learning.
[117:29.30]I want to lift a rock up so bad.
[117:36.06]Come on.
[117:37.66]Liftable rock.
[117:41.04]I can do it.
[117:41.98]I just need something stronger.
[117:45.41]Get everybody over here.
[117:46.13]Everybody come here.
[117:55.49]We all might need sticks.
[118:00.77]Let me make a few sticks.
[118:03.79]I need like a stick tree.
[118:07.63]That one right there?
[118:09.93]No.
[118:15.62]Can we use this though for something?
[118:31.91]Here.
[118:32.13]I don't know.
[118:32.45]We're not going to be able to use this for anything.
[118:33.92]But I'm going to put it over here.
[118:40.80]Give me a stick.
[118:41.34]A big one.
[118:46.79]I wasn't doing the rock thing right.
[118:48.11]I didn't have a prompt to do anything.
[118:49.15]It was this whole day.
[118:50.17]And let go and make that sound.
[118:51.95]I didn't hear a sound.
[118:58.52]There's a stick.
[119:00.26]That's for you.
[119:01.10]Come here.
[119:07.60]Here.
[119:08.38]You take that stick.
[119:09.74]We're all going to do this together.
[119:18.70]Come here.
[119:19.22]You.
[119:20.68]You take this one.
[119:28.97]This one's mine.
[119:32.01]Follow me.
[119:33.67]We're gonna go get the buried treasure that's underneath that rock.
[119:37.03]With me, let's go.
[119:38.01]Wait, first drink on your own, because you're too stupid to... I... Get over here.
[119:46.51]Drink.
[119:55.84]Just do what I do.
[119:59.66]Get in here!
[120:03.21]You're staring at it.
[120:04.09]You're so thirsty, but you won't drink the water.
[120:06.19]You're standing in.
[120:13.82]If only there was something cool and refreshing.
[120:27.54]Why are you covered in blood?
[120:38.11]He doesn't get it.
[120:39.48]Why do they not understand this?
[120:41.66]How do you not understand?
[120:46.54]Let's go.
[120:48.96]Follow me.
[120:51.58]Follow.
[120:52.78]Let's go.
[120:53.60]Bring your sticks.
[121:05.62]You gave them sticks to hold.
[121:07.38]Well, is that my fault that they're that stupid?
[121:11.68]Everybody together.
[121:13.05]Let's get this thing up.
[121:14.85]You got your sticks?
[121:15.53]Good.
[121:16.07]Together.
[121:16.43]Over here.
[121:23.39]Here we go.
[121:24.66]Help me lift.
[121:28.46]Bingo.
[121:29.70]I found mushrooms.
[121:37.60]Here it is.
[121:38.94]Take a look at that.
[121:46.88]New food.
[121:48.16]African agaric fungus.
[121:53.62]Here, you eat this.
[121:57.86]Who's the one that needs the most food?
[121:59.38]You?
[121:59.88]Just watch me eat it.
[122:04.98]I think that means that I have a stomach problem.
[122:10.24]Here, come try it.
[122:11.68]We have to get our stomachs stronger.
[122:15.44]Try the mushrooms.
[122:16.76]They're delightful.
[122:19.76]Anybody else gonna eat one of these?
[122:31.61]Okay.
[122:34.81]So, I know that those are mushrooms.
[122:36.85]Very cool.
[122:39.01]There is another spot.
[122:41.12]Right there.
[122:48.48]More mushrooms.
[122:58.45]Here.
[122:59.03]Somebody take one of these.
[123:01.03]Take this.
[123:01.51]Here.
[123:02.35]Try it.
[123:02.65]Look.
[123:07.26]See?
[123:07.82]Try it.
[123:15.29]Finally, he's eating it.
[123:18.92]You like it?
[123:19.32]It's good, huh?
[123:28.99]I think it's drugs.
[123:48.08]Okay, I think... Can we have some children?
[123:52.06]This is Tio, adult male, coupled with Ku.
[124:18.09]Well, let's keep going.
[124:18.89]I think there's another rock.
[124:23.05]Yep, there's more stuff over here to inspect.
[124:26.01]What's this?
[124:29.30]What do we got?
[124:30.54]Grab.
[124:31.84]This is a new rock.
[124:34.66]Ooh, this one's marble.
[124:37.50]New tool.
[124:41.56]Assault.
[124:43.48]What was that?
[124:51.01]What's that?
[124:51.37]What's that?
[124:51.75]What's that?
[125:00.09]Is it just the drugs?
[125:00.81]Is it drugs?
[125:02.13]It might just be drugs.
[125:03.82]Although something smells over here.
[125:23.33]I think we're good.
[125:26.43]No, I don't see anything.
[125:29.85]Alright, let me get this in memory.
[125:30.81]Am I on too many drugs to figure this out?
[125:38.34]There's some salt.
[125:39.38]Salt over here.
[125:40.12]I need to just record this.
[125:46.36]Evolution points for that.
[125:47.34]Alright, keep going.
[125:54.71]I freaked out first.
[125:55.67]I thought that was a giant snake.
[125:57.37]I thought that was the head of a gigantic fucking pterodactyl snake monster alien.
[126:03.94]With big spread out wings.
[126:08.96]I was about to shit my pants.
[126:12.30]What's over here?
[126:14.44]Anything up top?
[126:17.22]I think I want to go to the one back there.
[126:18.77]This is too dangerous.
[126:19.57]I'm not high enough level for this.
[126:25.24]Oh, there's that fiber.
[126:25.94]I probably should grab some of that.
[126:28.88]Yeah, let's get some of this fiber.
[126:30.32]I'm going to try to combine it with something.
[126:32.16]Right?
[126:33.92]Hangs on a tree down here.
[126:37.73]Can I do this?
[126:38.27]Maybe I can do something with these two things.
[126:42.99]Yep, let's make a spear.
[127:06.09]Am I hungry or thirsty?
[127:12.41]Okay, this all can alter a stick.
[127:14.41]Okay, got it.
[127:16.91]Spin that around.
[127:18.19]I need to grab the... Okay, there's a couple over here.
[127:29.09]Where is it?
[127:29.43]There's one hanging from that tree right there.
[127:31.09]I need to throw this rock.
[127:32.65]I don't need it anymore.
[127:33.37]Just get rid of it.
[127:35.88]And I'm going for right there.
[127:46.23]I want to use this.
[127:46.95]I don't want to just rub this on my body.
[127:48.23]I want to put this somewhere else.
[127:51.43]You know what I mean?
[127:52.17]I need to craft this into something.
[127:53.93]Maybe I can grind it on the spear?
[128:09.78]Use it on the bloody clan member.
[128:11.26]That's actually not a bad idea.
[128:12.22]That's not a bad idea at all.
[128:15.28]Where are they?
[128:16.64]Let me see if it's... Can I, like, burn it?
[128:21.62]Maybe I can light it.
[128:22.24]Alright, follow me.
[128:34.03]Back to the campsite.
[128:39.84]We are good.
[128:42.02]What's the dead?
[128:42.56]What's the dead thing mean?
[128:49.00]Okay, I know, I knew that you were dead.
[129:10.76]Okay, there's the kid.
[129:13.04]Is there another person dead?
[129:13.88]I don't think so.
[129:15.79]Alright, so let me see.
[129:16.47]What can I do with this?
[129:17.27]I have a stick.
[129:19.17]Let me get a rock.
[129:19.85]Give me a rock.
[129:20.35]I'm gonna hit the rock and the fiber together.
[129:25.91]I want a rock.
[129:31.84]I would love to pick that obsidian up that's right here.
[129:35.40]But I can't.
[129:35.98]This is not possible.
[129:45.05]So we're gonna go over here.
[129:45.71]Here's a rock.
[129:49.85]Alright.
[129:51.13]Can I smash these two together?
[129:56.55]So I smashed them.
[130:05.15]That's not gonna do anything.
[130:07.73]Okay, I can stop it.
[130:08.41]Okay.
[130:11.99]Um... What about this one?
[130:13.87]This other rock.
[130:21.27]This is obsidian, right?
[130:26.85]No.
[130:27.21]Can I... Just eat this.
[130:30.15]Just craft it by itself.
[130:31.25]Okay.
[130:39.60]I can't.
[130:39.94]I'm missing something.
[130:49.39]Maybe the rock?
[130:53.40]No.
[130:54.00]It's something else.
[130:56.92]Smash it.
[130:57.48]Smash it.
[130:58.12]Smash with rock.
[130:59.04]Smash with rock.
[131:00.24]No, I need an obsidian rock.
[131:02.24]Not this one.
[131:02.66]This rock sucks.
[131:04.87]I need an obsidian rock.
[131:07.09]And there was two in my bed.
[131:09.81]But I can no longer get to them.
[131:11.11]So we're going to have to find another one.
[131:12.71]I already know what that is.
[131:16.87]Let's just identify all this shit.
[131:21.07]This gives me points, right?
[131:21.95]Might as well do it.
[131:26.65]Sleep spot?
[131:27.77]Ooh.
[131:29.07]Another sleep spot.
[131:31.75]Dead branch.
[131:32.65]That's for sticks.
[131:38.47]Another sleep spot.
[131:42.33]Nope.
[131:49.75]Okay.
[131:52.49]Hello, baby.
[132:04.43]Oh, there's a fishing spot right here.
[132:05.53]Obsidian rock?
[132:09.87]I think I found obsidian rock.
[132:13.83]Yes.
[132:15.09]Gimme.
[132:16.01]Here we go.
[132:17.89]Will this do anything?
[132:20.91]No, it won't.
[132:28.09]Well, I have an obsidian rock.
[132:30.03]I wanted this before.
[132:34.95]Try to sharpen this rock with the other rock, and then try to hit the sharpening rock on this, on this thing.
[132:42.12]Alright, let's try that.
[132:44.04]Give me a rock, put this down.
[132:48.92]God, fucking evolution sucks.
[132:51.14]Why did it take this long?
[132:53.24]Just learn to read already.
[132:54.53]Okay.
[133:03.61]Can I pick up this rock?
[133:04.85]Where's the rock that I just threw in the ground?
[133:08.97]Now I have to go to bed.
[133:11.27]This is just a regular rock.
[133:22.96]Oh, for the love of God.
[133:25.28]For the love of fucking God.
[133:27.36]Where is that rock that I had in my hand?
[133:35.69]And why can't I pick it up?
[133:50.62]Jesus.
[133:51.30]Okay, let's go.
[133:52.40]Come on!
[134:04.04]I need another obsidian rock now!
[134:06.48]Fuck!
[134:07.02]Why?
[134:07.48]I did it!
[134:10.26]I let it go when I heard the sound!
[134:12.92]What do you mean wrong hands?
[134:22.43]It doesn't make any sense!
[134:26.77]Do I really have to go on an expedition for a fucking obsidian rock?
[134:29.77]Because I can't get this dumb thing out of here?
[134:33.26]Somebody's dead.
[134:34.38]I don't know.
[134:34.70]They wouldn't drink water while they were standing in... I can't help you if you're going to do that.
[134:41.45]How am I supposed to help you?
[134:44.41]You won't even drink water while you're standing in the water.
[134:46.95]I didn't heal him.
[134:51.88]What do you mean heal?
[134:52.70]And how do I tear this bed in half so I can pick up the fucking rock in here?
[135:02.59]Oh my god, I have to go get a fucking rock, an obsidian rock, to hit the... I need to sleep first, because there's no way I'm gonna be able to do this without sleep.
[135:20.38]Go to bed.
[135:28.31]Okay.
[135:31.72]Environmental analysis has been unlocked.
[135:35.59]I can detect rocks better.
[135:36.89]That's all I... Alright, just keep these ones around.
[135:50.25]These ones down here.
[135:52.61]That's fine.
[135:54.94]And... Let's do...
[135:58.92]I had a manipulation while moving, that's fine too.
[136:01.41]Okay.
[136:04.35]Go to bed.
[136:10.69]Rock hunt.
[136:33.75]Oh, found a rock.
[136:35.65]Good.
[136:36.49]Except it's not an obsidian rock, so that's worthless to me.
[136:52.88]Alright.
[136:56.14]Granite rock.
[136:58.26]Dead guy.
[137:01.93]Higher intelligence.
[137:03.75]Ranch.
[137:05.49]I don't think there are any... I really want to get in there and get that rock, but I fucking can't get in there and get that rock.
[137:19.88]I'm gonna eat.
[137:21.88]And then go get a rock.
[137:42.90]Yeah, I know I could have cured the bleeding, but I wanted to... I wanted to try to combine the fiber with something else.
[137:49.61]I could have, like, wiped him off, but... I would rather try to combine it.
[137:53.93]Do I have a... What's wrong with me?
[138:00.84]Alright, I'm just going for it.
[138:04.92]No kids are with me.
[138:07.00]Give me a rock.
[138:09.95]Invention's more important than lives.
[138:16.01]No, don't know what that is.
[138:17.07]I'm just gonna have to go down here.
[138:32.25]Branch.
[138:35.83]Nope.
[138:39.04]Fishing spot.
[138:47.56]What are you doing here?
[138:49.03]Why are you here?
[138:49.69]Get out of here!
[138:52.17]It's- EW!
[139:05.94]How did you survive out here for so long?
[139:13.46]Holy shit.
[139:15.00]I can't believe you're still alive.
[139:21.88]Is there a grip in this game?
[139:27.53]Okay, good.
[139:32.33]Rest up here.
[139:43.46]Look who I found, guys.
[139:45.88]Any rocks?
[140:06.19]No.
[140:10.36]No.
[140:13.22]No.
[140:15.38]Can I make obsidian?
[140:16.50]That'd be great.
[140:19.60]You and I have to find a rock.
[140:22.09]And that's the only rock that I'm going to have for the whole clan.
[140:29.39]And we can't find one.
[140:30.03]So I'm just going to bring you back.
[140:44.49]That's so bad that looks so awful alright sit down Hang out here for a little bit you I'm gonna sleep till tomorrow Hippopotamus
[141:10.15]Oh wait, it's noon, never mind.
[141:14.31]Alright, who's left?
[141:15.43]I don't understand, I don't know, I don't get it!
[141:35.98]What?
[141:38.86]I need some water or something, please.
[141:53.45]I have to take the stick from you.
[141:56.67]Come here.
[141:57.53]Give me the stick.
[141:59.21]That's a rock.
[142:00.94]No, it's not.
[142:01.48]That's that thing.
[142:02.08]Give me this.
[142:04.10]Stop paying attention to this and get over here.
[142:12.38]He's fucking useless.
[142:21.58]No, there you go.
[142:22.20]Now you figured it out.
[142:27.42]Well, I'm going to take your stick then.
[142:32.04]That's fine.
[142:36.77]Alright, give me some... let me eat.
[142:39.69]I can't believe I'm still on this fucking quest for a dumb rock.
[142:47.62]There's an obsidian rock in my bed, and I can't take it out.
[143:02.47]Can't, like, cover it up.
[143:17.53]I need to make more children.
[143:20.80]Hit obsidian with normal rock.
[143:25.04]Fucking kidding me.
[144:04.85]It's not gonna doesn't work Combine rock with head
[144:22.45]Throw the rock at the obsidian?
[144:23.97]That's not gonna do anything.
[144:25.81]Why is it so hard to find one that's the most prevalent rock on Earth?
[144:32.51]Just give me the obsidian!
[144:35.69]It's right here, just give it to me!
[144:48.43]Let's just have sex, come here.
[144:51.16]We're a couple, right?
[144:53.73]We gotta have some children.
[144:54.93]Come here.
[144:58.62]No, we're not.
[144:59.80]I thought we were together.
[145:01.36]I thought this was... Apparently not.
[145:21.77]Is it female elder?
[145:27.63]It's OK.
[145:29.63]It's still possible.
[145:30.55]We're good.
[145:30.85]Is it?
[145:37.35]We good?
[146:04.31]OK, do we have to wait till next year?
[146:07.01]We're going to bed till tomorrow.
[146:23.59]Wait, are we both female?
[146:28.52]Is that true?
[146:32.12]We gotta go extinct.
[146:59.93]The male was the one that was bleeding.
[147:10.70]Oh, is it it?
[147:11.40]Is that over?
[147:12.92]Range detection for non-edible resources has increased.
[147:15.20]Oh, that's great.
[147:17.72]We're branching out, though.
[147:18.70]Hold on.
[147:21.64]Genetic mutation will be needed.
[147:26.66]Okay.
[147:29.12]Who's left?
[147:30.84]Spatial perception.
[147:32.49]Let's get this one down here as well.
[147:36.69]There are wild males.
[147:38.07]I have to find them.
[147:39.47]Well, that's not gonna fucking work out.
[147:44.79]Where's my mate?
[147:51.68]That's not right.
[147:53.10]No.
[147:53.84]Is it?
[148:03.54]No, that can't be right.
[148:04.64]No, that's not it.
[148:05.72]Right there.
[148:06.04]There we go.
[148:06.44]We're good.
[148:10.82]There we are.
[148:13.78]We have a job to do.
[148:24.79]We have to... I gotta go.
[148:25.93]Alright, it's time to go.
[148:27.03]I'm not sitting around looking at a rock screen anymore.
[148:31.41]I gotta get... I'm going.
[148:34.69]Give me a stick.
[148:35.85]I need to find new things.
[148:44.93]There's a new thing.
[148:47.11]I'm going that way.
[148:48.09]It's right here.
[148:49.94]Let's go.
[148:54.34]Find a mail.
[148:55.86]What do you think I'm trying to do right now?
[148:57.58]I gotta try to find somebody.
[149:15.40]No, why are you here?
[149:17.44]You shouldn't be here.
[149:22.60]Both of you shouldn't be here.
[149:23.92]Why are you both here?
[149:24.94]Alright, I got full on everything.
[149:41.43]It's time to move this way.
[149:43.65]I need to get something.
[149:44.83]Something.
[149:46.51]I have to get something going.
[149:50.73]There's that.
[149:51.79]We got something this way.
[149:57.19]There's nobody left at camp to watch them.
[149:59.97]Right.
[150:03.85]I guess that's true.
[150:05.29]We're gonna find it.
[150:05.91]We're gonna find a new camp.
[150:08.09]A new settlement.
[150:10.03]Hopefully it's right here.
[150:13.37]Don't forget that.
[150:14.07]Memorize that.
[150:15.61]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[150:16.85]Don't do anything stupid.
[150:28.27]That was stupid.
[150:29.83]I'm fine.
[150:39.01]Okay, we're good.
[150:42.74]Jump from here to there.
[150:48.18]Almost there.
[150:48.90]Whatever this is, whatever that is, I guess I'm gonna go look at it.
[150:54.01]How's everybody doing?
[150:55.27]Okay, you're with me still?
[150:58.81]You have any sticks or anything?
[151:01.37]No, you don't.
[151:01.95]Okay.
[151:06.09]Let's get on the tree.
[151:06.79]I'm gonna go down over here.
[151:07.67]Okay.
[151:13.41]Now what does it want me to do over there?
[151:14.87]There's some big point of interest over there.
[151:20.27]What?
[151:20.43]Why did it not grab?
[151:23.77]Okay, new stuff.
[151:27.55]It should have grabbed.
[151:28.57]Why did it not grab?
[151:32.71]What the fuck are you... What do you want me to do?
[151:34.53]What just happened?
[151:42.06]The Sister Arches, new landmark.
[151:51.80]New camp.
[152:05.49]Discover the Sister Arches at a memorable location.
[152:09.80]Good.
[152:10.90]So, what does that, what does that mean?
[152:15.59]Does that do anything for us?
[152:21.19]Not really?
[152:21.63]Alright, well, uh, okay.
[152:31.00]What's next?
[152:32.90]Stuff over here to look at.
[152:33.74]More of that fiber.
[152:39.76]That's a fucking obsidian.
[152:55.44]No, it's a granite rock.
[152:59.12]Wait.
[153:13.31]Hey, hello?
[153:18.10]No, it's a pig.
[153:28.83]What's that?
[153:33.07]Somebody else over here?
[153:34.83]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[153:38.03]How are you?
[153:39.41]Nice to meet you.
[153:44.64]You alright?
[153:50.30]Something's wrong.
[154:01.76]Do you have any, um... Let's get the food.
[154:07.95]Here.
[154:09.05]Take this.
[154:09.63]Eat this.
[154:16.70]How you doing?
[154:21.84]You go?
[154:22.16]Okay.
[154:23.78]Let's get another one.
[154:24.56]Let's get some more.
[154:28.36]Here, try this.
[154:29.35]This will help.
[154:58.65]Alright, couple formed.
[155:00.61]Alright, so male.
[155:03.11]OK.
[155:03.23]Alright, stay right there.
[155:19.68]Stay.
[155:19.88]Don't move.
[155:20.24]Don't move.
[155:20.52]Don't move.
[155:20.80]Everyone chill.
[155:27.59]Where's the beehive?
[155:31.77]Okay, I'll be right back.
[155:33.15]I'm gonna get one of these beehives and I'm gonna heal you.
[155:37.20]Stay there.
[155:37.98]Don't move.
[155:40.20]Where's one?
[155:40.66]Right here?
[155:40.96]There's one right at the top of this tree.
[155:45.38]I will be right back.
[155:50.92]It's a long fall.
[155:53.70]I think I can make the jump from here to there.
[156:07.06]Give me it.
[156:23.39]Okay.
[156:24.45]I got it.
[156:26.19]Don't fall from that height.
[156:32.21]I want to climb down.
[156:36.51]Can I make it from here?
[156:44.82]Yes, I can.
[156:45.22]Alright, come here.
[156:48.22]I got something for you over here.

[158:09.67]I think he's fine.
[158:10.41]He's not injured anymore.
[158:11.54]No, he's fine.
[158:15.06]You have a broken bone?
[158:18.82]But did it take too long?
[158:20.90]Alright, let's go.
[158:21.84]Ooh, new stuff.
[158:32.89]Okay, we need to get back to...
[158:37.88]I can't go any further.
[158:38.76]This is literally the last of the entire clan.
[158:43.22]Right?
[158:45.64]We gotta head back.
[158:47.48]Let's make a bed over here.
[158:59.85]Can I just make a bed with these?
[159:01.17]I think I can.
[159:10.68]Get out of the way.
[159:20.49]Ooh.
[159:22.83]I'm trying to make us a bed.
[159:29.50]Is that enough?
[159:42.64]We gotta get this going.
[159:43.94]Alright, come here.
[159:44.70]No, no, no, no.
[159:51.85]I need to settle.
[159:52.61]What do you mean, settle?
[159:57.91]Settle?
[160:02.83]Oh, I made this my noose.
[160:07.00]On the edge of a mount on a cliff.
[160:09.46]We did it!
[160:09.88]We bought a new home!
[160:13.73]You and me!
[160:16.09]And the old lady!
[160:22.35]We did it!
[160:26.19]Alright, let's go.
[160:43.71]Hooray.
[160:44.85]Give birth.
[160:46.25]Let's go.
[160:46.73]New member.
[161:04.17]My child.
[161:19.81]15 months later.
[161:20.53]Hey, Granny's still there.
[161:24.37]I was probably supposed to do this in the first like 30 minutes.
[161:45.22]Ran right into the screen.
[161:46.78]New baby!
[161:48.74]Alright.
[162:28.63]Oh, there's another one and she's so beautiful Congrats on twins.
[162:38.33]I wonder if you'll learn anything Go for another
[162:48.11]Can you?
[162:48.49]I don't think you can.
[162:50.55]Maybe you can.
[162:51.77]Where's the other baby?
[163:24.43]What's this?
[163:26.54]New communication skill.
[163:34.04]That's a long way to go.
[163:34.90]I don't think it's gonna make it.
[163:38.57]It's not gonna make it.
[163:42.21]It made it.
[163:43.79]It's now possible to ask from a distance some clan members to come closer and follow.
[163:49.30]Hold B and release B to have the visible clan members follow you.
[163:52.28]Okay.
[163:56.40]Body language.
[163:57.80]I need to do some more like punching and kicking.
[164:01.70]Evolution.
[164:05.80]explore expand feared rival feared species what is this advanced problem solver to launch an evolution you must be at your clan settlement have passed at least one generation and succeeded in evolutionary feet leading tool user rocks use the tool ready ready one ready three
[164:36.49]Are these just achievements?
[164:38.01]Evolve.
[164:41.33]Birth of a Cartographer.
[164:48.21]Oh.
[164:48.37]Okay.
[164:49.85]Now.
[164:54.47]I'm not mating again, no.
[164:58.25]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[165:08.02]Item manipulation.
[165:10.98]Drop while moving.
[165:14.78]Body language.
[165:16.98]And this one.
[165:18.72]Okay.
[165:19.14]Change generation?
[165:20.10]Is that what I'm going to do?
[165:26.36]When passing a generation, the neurons that have not been reinforced will lose their energy and will have to be refilled.
[165:30.88]All unborn babies will also be lost.
[165:34.88]Do you want to still pass a generation?
[165:41.65]Am I doing this?
[166:14.15]So we... we... these are the kids that are grown up now.
[166:19.47]Fifteen years later.
[166:22.05]Is that grandma?
[166:23.73]Fifteen years later?
[166:25.19]Fifteen years!
[166:28.07]Fifteen years!
[166:29.29]Reinforced your lineage's neural development, early phase one.
[166:32.09]What do you mean, fifteen years?
[166:35.24]Metabolism is now effective.
[166:38.34]Where is everybody?
[166:45.37]Oh, okay, this is you.

[167:51.07]Okay, so we have to do some... Somebody has to have a kid.
[168:03.22]Oh shit, look at that.
[168:05.74]You and the members of the lineage will have the capacity to better metabolize nutrients.
[168:12.87]This spontaneous genetic mutation will become effective after the lineage's next evolution.
[168:20.57]Okay.
[168:25.69]This is... Right.
[168:29.28]Alright, I need to... We need to go out there.
[168:39.40]Okay, there's a lot of people We got a There's a big amount of people here So let's do I want Let's get some rocks First things first Let's eat

[169:16.51]Got some sticks and some rocks and some spears.
[169:18.13]Let's take a look at the new destination we've got.
[169:28.78]Oh, somebody is over there.
[169:30.84]I think there's children.
[169:33.25]There's like 30 people in this clan.
[169:39.33]Tribe, or whatever this is.
[169:48.50]What is like a bunch of... What is it called?
[169:50.86]Is it a... Is it a clan?

[170:04.65]Okay.
[170:06.84]What is that?
[170:07.76]I found the big stick in the middle of the forest.
[170:10.58]Let's go look at it.
[170:19.24]What did you want me to do here?
[170:21.70]Is that not what you wanted me to do?
[170:44.41]Oh, it's not actually anything.
[170:45.55]Okay.
[170:51.97]Grass.
[170:57.34]Fishing spot.
[171:01.22]Still, by the way, just want to make sure everyone's aware, haven't seen a single obsidian rock on the ground.
[171:05.83]It's been 17 years.
[171:26.75]This is just danger.
[171:27.95]I don't want to do this.
[171:28.81]This is bad.
[171:29.43]Crocodiles and shit everywhere.
[171:30.73]This is a stupid idea.
[171:37.67]Where you going?
[171:42.66]Where you going?
[171:43.08]Where you all going?
[171:43.58]Where you all going?

[171:45.04]Why are you running?
[171:47.32]Why are you all running in random directions?
[171:50.92]Excuse me.
[171:58.26]See you in Rockdale.
[172:01.60]We gotta get some sticks.
[172:06.91]There's something right there that I don't know what it is.

[173:40.98]Is it obsidian?
[173:44.42]No.
[173:48.93]That's probably the loudest sound I've ever done.
[173:53.61]You still around?
[174:01.47]Oh, there's alligators and shit.
[174:02.59]How are you ever supposed to do this?
[174:07.59]This is not even possible.
[174:12.19]How did anybody... How did humans survive?
[174:16.55]I can't even find a fucking rock on the ground.
[174:18.39]And you're telling me that we've... No way.
[174:22.73]We were dropped off by aliens.
[174:35.10]Up the tree.
[174:35.86]Everybody.
[174:40.76]I'm like bleeding.
[174:41.60]I need one of those fucking beehives.
[174:43.36]Here we go.
[174:47.29]Go up here.
[175:02.45]There might just be one up here.
[175:06.69]There it is.
[175:09.77]Give me it.
[175:10.07]Okay, use it.
[175:23.22]Anybody else hurt?
[175:24.98]I got another one of these.
[175:25.68]Anybody bleeding?
[175:32.01]I just... want to rock.
[175:39.02]I don't want to come this far out on an expedition.
[175:40.78]I just want a rock.
[175:42.62]I want an obsidian rock.
[175:48.78]I can't get it.
[175:51.81]I need a stick.
[175:57.61]I want to poke these rocks.
[176:08.41]Let's go back to camp.
[176:09.49]I need to fi- seriously.
[176:13.77]Have everybody else stay home while you get a rock so nobody dies?
[176:15.93]That's not a bad idea.
[176:21.99]That statement I just made... is stupid.
[176:25.20]What the hell is going on now?
[176:30.22]Everybody stay home till I- so I can find a rock, okay?
[176:44.68]What is it?
[176:45.04]Oh, it's a snake, I think.
[176:46.76]Snake, maybe, somewhere.
[176:47.84]Alright, back to camp.
[176:52.63]Let's go.
[176:57.97]Down there.
[177:02.80]I need to...
[177:15.17]7 out of 10, 7 out of 10, 7 out of 10... What are you talking about?
[177:22.73]Can I combine these two?
[177:26.81]I wonder if I can combine... Maybe I can.
[177:30.44]Don't try this at home.
[177:31.18]Alright, here we are.
[177:36.24]Back at our camp.
[177:39.94]It's currently 15 o'clock.
[177:43.24]I'm gonna combine these.
[177:47.49]No, I'm not.
[177:51.33]Let me take a good look at all of you.
[177:54.29]Anybody bleeding?
[178:01.91]What does end expedition even mean?
[178:03.83]I'm gonna leave this here.
[178:06.37]Who would have thought finding sticks would have been the hardest fucking thing in this whole game?
[178:18.72]There was one tree that had sticks.
[178:20.28]I don't even know what the fuck you want me to do with this thing, man.
[178:32.85]Here, you take this.
[178:33.51]I don't know, whatever.
[178:35.03]Can I use this, maybe?
[178:36.27]Combine these two?
[178:40.47]No.
[178:42.21]Can I poke at the hole?
[178:43.15]Alright, everybody stay here.
[178:48.44]Wait.
[178:49.24]All of you.
[178:50.46]Nobody come with me.
[178:51.24]I don't want to see one person here.
[178:56.29]Stay.
[179:00.27]You too.
[179:00.81]All of you.
[179:01.37]Stay.
[179:01.69]Okay.
[179:11.79]I'm gonna go poke that hole.
[179:15.85]See what happens.
[179:19.77]It's down here, right?
[179:21.01]Maybe there's another one.
[179:23.39]I can't believe it's just granite.
[179:24.75]Where the hell am I going to find obsidian?
[179:40.53]Just mix lava and water.
[179:42.15]It's easier said than done.
[179:44.39]Oh, finally.
[179:47.03]Okay, I'm actually kind of glad you came with me, because we need to make some sticks.
[179:57.73]Take this.
[180:03.43]Now get the fuck out of here.
[180:24.07]Can I combine both the two sticks together?
[180:26.90]For any reason?
[180:28.24]No.
[180:28.60]I'm just dual welding.
[180:29.44]Okay, that's fine.
[180:30.70]Alright, now I... I... This is a stick.
[180:32.48]I can poke with these.
[180:33.22]Fucking granite!
[180:49.53]Where's the hole?
[180:50.13]I really don't even know where the hole was.
[180:53.89]I thought they were right here.
[180:55.55]There it is.
[180:58.18]Alright, here we go.
[181:18.08]poking food can be poked out of holes okay so how do I learn stabbing if you know you can poke why can't you know you can stab I haven't learned that yet apparently
[182:05.24]Yeah, right there.
[182:08.38]Shake?
[182:12.48]Oh, it's- it's drawing coconuts!
[182:17.73]Coconuts have fallen.
[182:18.75]This is awesome.
[182:19.41]Okay, hold on I think it's a pig Yeah, it's a pig
[182:51.18]Just chill.
[183:06.77]I'm trying to spear this motherfucker.
[183:18.51]I'm walking bait.
[183:20.26]Wait, can I stick it?
[183:21.40]Wait, hold on.
[183:21.88]I think I can do this.
[183:25.07]No, I want to stick a straw in there and drink it.
[183:50.55]I swear to fucking God, man.
[183:52.43]What?
[183:55.67]Oh, why does this have to fucking happen?
[183:58.39]God damn it.
[184:01.47]That's two in a row.
[184:02.47]Twice in a row.
[184:03.19]Alright, why can't the boar come over here?
[184:08.55]Shake coconuts onto his head.
[184:20.88]Get away from me.
[184:28.04]No, get... No, no, no, don't call anybody.
[185:00.36]I'm fine.
[185:05.60]Okay, I'm fine.
[185:06.12]I'm fine.
[185:06.46]I'm fine.
[185:06.76]I'm fine.
[185:07.16]I'm fine.
[185:09.57]Get away from...
[185:28.11]Seriously?
[185:29.23]I need it!
[185:30.32]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[185:31.38]I need one of those things.
[185:32.34]No!
[186:04.31]Ew.
[186:06.23]Is that you?
[186:14.24]Ew.
[186:14.86]Come here.
[186:18.04]Ew.
[186:20.98]Hey.
[186:25.73]You alright?
[186:27.91]Oh, no.
[186:28.47]That's not... Never mind.
[186:38.92]Oh, I'm alright.
[186:39.48]I'm good.
[186:40.78]I'm you.
[186:41.58]Right.
[186:42.24]I know.
[186:50.24]I want a fucking rock.
[186:55.03]I want a fucking obsidian rock.
[186:58.49]Why is that such a rare resource in this game?
[187:20.45]Okay.
[187:22.91]I can use granite?
[187:23.84]I don't need obsidian to scrape the granite to make it so it's a scrapey rock?
[187:28.78]I thought that was the whole deal.
[187:31.28]Oh, by the way, what the hell have I been doing for the last, like, 45 minutes?
[187:39.18]I can just use two rocks.
[187:40.18]Ay, carumba.
[187:49.27]What is...
[187:50.79]No, give me that.
[187:52.35]No, give that back to me.
[187:55.47]Yeah, you can't be trusted with this.
[187:56.63]This is mine.
[188:00.19]I need to sleep.
[188:01.44]Back to bed.
[188:01.90]Let's go.
[188:15.74]I did end an expedition.
[188:17.36]I don't know what that does.
[188:32.96]Alright, we got some new stuff to do.
[188:34.00]What's over here?
[188:38.01]How motor skills will improve.
[188:40.85]The neuron can't be initiated because you don't have the neurological energy.
[188:44.35]Carrying kids will perform... So I have to carry around the kids.
[188:58.04]Do you want to sleep?
[189:15.70]I also need a water source, yeah.
[189:24.63]Am I lying in- with a skeleton?
[189:27.71]There's bones in here.
[189:30.35]I'm sleeping in a grave.
[189:44.24]Alright.
[189:45.76]Now give me a rock.
[189:46.76]Give me two rocks.
[189:50.46]I need to drink water.
[189:54.70]And then... I don't even remember what the fuck I was going to do with those rocks.
[189:59.26]I have no clue.
[190:03.68]I was going to do something with the fiber.
[190:06.86]With the rock that could be grinding, right?
[190:23.82]God, I want to eat, not pick up an item on the ground.
[190:25.70]This is not very nutritious.
[190:55.88]How much do I have to drink of this shit?
[191:03.77]Is there anybody to even tell?
[191:11.59]There's just a big green circle on my screen.
[191:22.35]Just drink it all.
[191:23.95]I'm going to make this... Here we go.
[191:26.76]There we... Two rocks.

[192:46.07]Oh, you motherfucker.
[192:53.47]Where are these things?
[192:55.31]I swear to God, every time I'm looking for something, it's not on the screen.
[193:00.32]There were just like 300 of these.
[193:04.88]And now they just don't exist.
[193:22.09]What?
[193:25.01]Where are all the honeycombs?
[193:30.75]Oh my god.

[194:03.10]I'm very hungry.
[194:04.20]Like, too hungry to even grab anything.
[194:07.30]Is there a bird's nest up here?
[194:09.92]What is this?

[204:49.61]I'm not furious.
[204:50.59]I'm fine.
[204:51.43]I'm fine.
[204:51.91]Don't worry.
[204:52.25]I'm gonna be fine.
[205:00.30]But I will... I will... Put this down.
[205:05.72]I want to...
[205:14.83]I have... Yes, I got a grinder.
[205:16.67]I have a grinder in my hand.
[205:17.99]But what the hell do I do with a grinder?
[205:19.71]Grind up berries?
[205:20.67]Seeds?
[205:21.75]Berries?
[205:22.83]What?
[205:23.31]I don't understand.
[205:24.27]What do you... Why do I have this?
[205:35.96]I want to lift that so bad.
[205:37.14]There's only mushrooms.
[205:40.59]Alright, so...
[205:43.95]Let's think about a scenario here where I don't get killed by the boar that's near me.
[206:08.54]Make a stick and kill the boar.
[206:11.12]There ain't even any combat in this game.
[206:13.20]I don't... What's going on?
[206:30.63]He's even killing other players.
[206:32.91]He's killing other players that aren't even me.
[206:35.69]What?
[206:36.09]Is there a cop?
[206:37.47]What's this flashlight in my eyes?
[206:47.00]Help!
[206:48.51]Where is he?
[206:54.26]I wanna go to the boar and like pick up the boar meat.
[207:16.25]When am I gonna discover fire?
[207:17.47]I don't think I'm gonna discover fire.
[207:21.25]I'm having trouble discovering rocks on the ground.
[207:23.43]You think I'm gonna be able to do fire?
[207:40.10]What is it?
[207:40.88]Why?
[207:41.26]Why?
[207:41.58]What's here?
[207:42.14]What's here?
[207:44.01]Okay, just get rid of one of these fucking rocks.
[207:46.33]Which one of them is the grill?
[207:48.09]Which one of the rocks is like the griddle?
[207:49.47]Why is this?
[207:50.17]Am I being stalked?
[207:51.70]I can't tell which one is the grill on it.
[207:53.58]I don't know.
[207:54.82]Can anyone see?
[207:55.42]Okay, it's on my left hand.
[207:57.90]That means right hand.
[207:58.62]I can just throw it.
[207:59.24]I don't care.
[208:00.24]Okay, now what is this?
[208:08.51]What is this?
[208:11.79]Why is it telling me to look at this or be aware of this?
[208:21.15]Inspect.
[208:23.81]No.
[208:29.28]Go to the light.
[208:30.12]Should I?
[208:33.76]Should I do that?
[208:40.39]Why is it doing some Truman Show shit?
[208:48.08]What did I just do?
[208:53.96]I just picked that up and... Waterfall.
[209:11.21]Alright.
[209:12.45]There's the tiger.
[209:13.23]And there's the boar.
[209:13.79]I'm going to be patient here.
[209:17.62]I'll just sleep.
[209:23.64]Look at that.
[209:25.06]I'm going to wait until he's gone.
[209:26.80]Should I throw the panini at him?
[209:29.52]I'm going to throw my fucking panini at him and see if he leaves.
[209:38.62]Don't, don't do that.
[209:39.26]Wait, hold on.
[209:39.80]There's got to be something I can throw over there.
[209:43.02]Right?
[209:43.16]Like a stick or a branch or something.
[209:47.78]I want that so bad.
[209:49.18]Alright, here we go.
[209:50.74]Alright, I've got to, I'm just going to throw this over there.
[209:56.30]Because I want to go, I want to go like sniff, I want to go smell the corpse.
[210:00.13]That's what they do.
[210:02.41]Is that the panini?
[210:03.57]I can't tell.
[210:07.29]I don't even know what's in my hands.
[210:08.41]Okay, what's in my right hand?
[210:11.09]Okay, here we go.
[210:11.73]Ready?
[210:11.91]Let's see if I can get him to move over here.
[210:13.41]Dude, I would love to do a jumping R1 on this fucking tiger right now.
[210:42.88]Why did it just put me like all the way down here?
[210:44.71]There's another combat scenario coming up here.
[210:46.45]There's a snake.
[210:56.04]Snake is going to the target right now.
[210:59.68]Look it.
[211:00.38]See?
[211:02.54]This could be huge.
[211:03.80]This could be huge for me.
[211:05.50]I just have to observe and the snake might kill.
[211:09.77]Snake is right there.
[211:12.30]The snake might kill the tiger from behind.
[211:19.18]This is great.
[211:20.02]I love climbing.
[211:20.66]Apparently didn't learn that.
[211:23.36]Okay, sit right here.
[211:38.87]Is that not a snake?
[211:43.86]How do I get you to leave?
[211:47.75]Any rock plus stick equals weapon.
[211:49.71]I tried that before.
[211:53.81]Can I sneak up and grab a stick?
[211:59.53]The only stick I can see is literally right here.
[212:02.75]There's a stick there.
[212:03.87]That's the only thing.
[212:04.47]I can get it.
[212:07.03]I'm gonna try.
[212:37.45]This is scary!
[212:48.25]I made it!
[212:55.10]Okay, this is my chance, my opportunity to intimidate.
[212:58.24]I got my rock.
[213:12.85]What's wrong with me?
[213:13.45]Am I going- Oh, I'm about to lose my mind, right?
[213:20.44]Sniping with the rock.
[213:21.22]Okay, I gotta go for it right now.
[213:22.34]This is the time.
[213:23.38]Go.
[213:31.63]Quick!
[213:31.99]For other generations!
[214:00.89]Do we get to be the tiger?
[214:26.00]No more fucking around.
[214:31.92]I am pissed.
[214:35.04]Give me a rock.
[214:45.95]Give me a stick.
[214:50.15]I wonder if it's gonna take me like another 40 minutes to find a rock.
[214:59.41]Assemble a crew and avenge.
[215:04.11]Liftable rock.
[215:05.09]Got it.
[215:09.76]Oh.
[215:11.68]It actually means I can just pick it up.
[215:13.38]Okay, here we go.
[215:13.90]Ready?
[215:15.66]I'm making a deadly fucking weapon.
[215:45.72]The granite rock and altar are thick.
[215:47.21]I already knew that.
[215:49.83]Okay.
[215:53.77]I now have my weapon in my hand.
[215:58.39]What's that thing?
[215:58.91]What's that?
[216:01.04]Whoa, there's frogs.
[216:01.92]Hold on.
[216:02.20]Wait, wait, there's frogs.
[216:03.50]Can I pick them up?
[216:12.02]No.
[216:14.77]What was that?
[216:16.89]What is wrong with me?
[216:21.37]What the fuck was that?
[216:22.45]Does it mean I'm tired?
[216:28.87]Alright, well I got a stick.
[216:35.96]I need to hit something.
[216:38.24]The only combat that the game told me for tutorial was A is dodge.
[216:42.54]I wonder if A is swing too.
[216:46.21]I mean, everything in this whole fucking game is A. So I would be shocked if it wasn't A to swing.
[216:50.37]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[216:58.86]A is counterattack.
[216:59.90]A is dodge.
[217:00.64]A is jump.
[217:01.30]A is learn.
[217:01.98]A. A for ape.
[217:05.71]Of course.
[217:22.77]I want to make another couple of sticks.
[217:25.53]When can I evolve to literally use my other hand for anything?
[217:33.49]I'm not just lefty.
[217:34.52]I don't have access to my left arm.
[217:37.56]I mean, I'm not just a righty.
[217:38.88]I don't have any access to my left hand.
[218:09.74]Where is my stick?
[218:13.14]Where's the stick that actually has a sharp end to it?
[218:15.67]I'm killing this motherfucker right now.
[218:35.90]I just wanted to go to sleep.
[218:41.74]I just wanted to go to bed.
[218:43.30]I just wanted to get a rock and go to sleep.
[218:45.54]And now I'm gonna die.
[218:53.71]And I'm underwater now, so I can't even... There it is.
[219:02.17]Where's the bed?
[219:02.69]I... Where's the bed?
[219:05.81]The whole... This is... I'm looking... It's like cel-shaded graphics now.
[219:12.48]Is somebody pissed in my cel-shaded graphics space?
[219:14.82]Okay?
[219:15.56]Like, what?
[219:16.92]Where is the bed?
[219:31.43]Sleep it off.
[219:49.29]All you gotta do, okay, food and water is bad, very bad.
[219:52.57]Not good at all.
[219:54.44]I need to, hold on.
[219:58.98]Do I have enough of this yet?
[220:00.04]No, I don't have any, like, children.
[220:01.44]Oh no, my birth and death rate is terrible.
[220:14.46]I can't do any of these.
[220:21.08]Well, I know that there is water down here.
[220:24.86]I think there's food as well.
[220:29.93]There is.
[220:30.27]Everybody come over here and eat.
[220:39.66]You've died every time somebody's been born.
[220:47.89]Well, come on!
[220:48.67]My only goals in this game are to eat food and dodge tigers.
[221:12.26]Failed both of them?
[221:13.02]Yeah, one of those is a lot easier than the other one.
[221:28.89]Over-hydrated.
[221:30.01]Die.
[221:34.27]Hey, anybody else fucking idiot?
[221:35.93]Doesn't want a drink?
[221:36.72]Come on down here.
[221:38.06]You need me to show you how, hey, you can lead a man to water, but you can't make him fish, or whatever it is.
[221:46.89]You can teach a man to fish, but you can't give him water.

[225:16.73]Why don't they learn?
[225:21.05]I'm the only one that learns here.
[225:23.31]Nobody else does.
[225:26.12]In fact, they're so fucking stupid, if they're holding an item, they will starve to death.
[225:37.68]Why?

[226:29.96]Now, I just need a rock.
[226:34.36]And then the three of us are going to go.
[226:41.68]Speciesies will evolve.
[226:42.67]Yeah, we already did evolve.
[226:45.45]This is 17 years have gone by.
[226:46.89]There's already been another generation.
[226:48.05]Okay.
[227:02.38]You need to have babies?
[227:03.39]What is going on?
[227:15.49]Yeah, what?
[227:16.28]Evolution, guys.
[227:17.98]You don't... We grew, like, extra hands and fingers from our grandparents.
[227:23.42]It takes, like, ten years, right?
[227:24.68]Alright, give me my sticks.
[227:37.41]I'm gonna mate.
[227:38.31]We're gonna have some babies.
[227:41.41]We're gonna go out with our three spears.

[231:32.30]Do I still have the rock in my hand?
[231:55.92]I'm gonna be fine.
[232:04.76]Get kids and carry them around.
[232:05.92]Do you guys remember like a couple hours ago when I was doing that and everybody told me not to do that anymore because I was endangering the children?
[232:14.23]Turns out it was what I was supposed to be doing the whole time!
[232:18.43]Alright, I've got- give me the third stick.
[232:23.67]Your ancestors were fucking stupid.
[232:31.07]Hey, well, guess what?
[232:32.30]They were your fucking ancestors, too.
[232:36.28]You think that's going to offend me?
[232:37.98]This is your great-great-great-great-great grandparents, too.
[233:10.42]So I have weapons.
[233:15.81]Three spears are made.
[233:18.43]Maybe I should do a fourth just to make sure we're all ready.
[233:20.83]Is that it?
[233:23.19]One more.
[233:25.27]Sometimes it's hard to tell.
[233:27.39]Okay, another one.
[233:28.93]One more.
[233:30.07]One more.
[233:31.88]Okay.
[233:34.02]Three spears.
[233:35.70]There are one... Here comes the deep freeze.
[233:39.40]Here comes the ice age.
[233:40.22]Alright, one, two, three, there are four of us.
[233:49.69]Four spears.
[233:52.79]We're gonna have, like, three kids...
[234:22.25]Make a fire?
[234:25.05]I have no idea how to do that.
[234:27.45]Every time I've tried to, I bang two rocks together, scrape two rocks, grab a leaf, scrape a leaf,
[234:39.63]Rub two sticks together.
[234:41.23]On top of leaves?
[234:44.77]I don't think I can do fire.
[234:45.77]Didn't somebody say I couldn't do that yet?
[234:46.89]Okay.
[234:50.07]I got four spears.
[234:51.63]Just put them down.
[234:52.47]This is my community rock.
[234:54.07]Just let it sit there.
[234:58.02]Who wants to come lie down with me?
[235:00.24]What do we got?
[235:04.80]Am I female?
[235:07.22]I'm not sure.
[235:17.96]Alright, come here.
[235:19.32]You.
[235:19.66]I think you and I should be hanging out.
[235:21.82]Maybe.
[235:24.40]Alright.
[235:24.90]Come to bed.
[235:50.21]We need two kids.
[236:14.42]And they have evolved.
[236:25.35]Four spears.
[236:27.07]For the four of us.
[236:28.63]We're gonna go out, we're gonna make it happen.
[236:39.91]I have to watch this every time.
[236:43.49]It wouldn't be bad if it was not the same cutscene.
[236:53.39]Like, do, like, three different potential cutscenes.
[236:59.60]Here we go.
[237:00.02]Doing it again.
[237:03.36]Uh, baby with a spontaneous genetic mutation.
[237:09.81]Here comes another one.
[237:23.88]Gonna wear both the babies, gonna go out, dig up some mushrooms.
[237:28.70]Hopefully down a tiger while we're at it.

[237:33.51]Down a tiger.
[237:35.47]Get a... eat, drink.
[237:39.19]Be equipped.
[237:52.35]I wonder if he's gonna run into the camera!
[238:09.22]Cool, alright, two babies, let's go.
[238:11.66]Have we slept?
[238:14.40]We've slept, I think, right?
[238:16.50]Alright, let's go kids.
[238:22.53]Everybody gather up.
[238:27.28]What are they doing?
[238:30.52]You slept for two years.
[238:32.66]Okay.
[238:33.66]Everybody listen up.
[238:37.19]What I want you to do is I want you to grab a stick.
[238:45.49]Mannequins.
[238:48.43]All of you.
[238:54.24]Here, this one's for you.
[238:55.16]Alright.
[238:59.52]We are now armed.

[239:07.11]How do I pick up these kids?
[239:13.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[239:21.60]Let's head to the stream.
[239:24.07]I would like everybody to eat something before we move out.
[239:28.82]Follow my lead.
[239:30.04]Pick up a berry.
[239:31.12]Eat it.
[239:34.16]Watch me.
[239:39.47]You know what?
[239:39.79]No, let's go fishing.
[239:40.49]Let's go fishing and just eat raw fish and shit.
[239:42.33]Whatever.
[239:44.45]With me.
[239:44.77]Let's go.
[239:53.99]Where's that fishing spot?
[239:54.87]I know there's one over here.
[239:58.61]Alright.
[239:59.31]Learn.
[240:01.49]Through me.
[240:04.08]Do as I do.
[240:04.92]I mean, somebody could make a reference here about something seeing and something doing.
[240:12.88]But I'm not gonna make that.
[240:14.04]Just follow me and do what I do.
[240:26.14]And... Got one.
[240:29.38]Ooh, this is a fish.
[240:33.88]This is a bass.
[240:41.21]This will feed us for days.
[240:42.07]Okay, um... Who's gonna eat this?
[240:52.90]Should you eat this?
[240:55.52]Alright, I'm gonna show you how to eat this.
[240:59.42]See?
[241:00.78]I took a bite out of it.
[241:01.48]It's good, huh?
[241:03.14]Hey, kid.
[241:04.52]Try this.
[241:10.33]Don't try this, actually.
[241:11.73]You probably shouldn't try this.
[241:23.62]Okay, now you try.
[241:25.30]See?
[241:27.05]It's pretty good.
[241:27.73]Try it.
[241:30.41]Don't eat it all.
[241:31.67]Don't eat the whole thing.
[241:33.59]Greedy.
[241:34.91]Very greedy.
[241:35.95]You shouldn't be doing that.
[241:38.36]See?
[241:38.88]You pissed up Dave behind you.
[241:44.10]Take your stick back.
[241:45.84]Let's do it again.
[241:47.58]Look at me.
[241:48.76]Follow me.
[241:51.63]These kids are gonna learn this too.
[241:52.95]This is an invaluable skill.
[241:55.87]Here we go.

[242:13.71]Alright, stay there.
[242:16.61]That's what I was talking about.
[242:18.59]This is why you don't eat the whole thing.
[242:26.06]What happened?
[242:26.58]Where did my stick go?
[242:30.12]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[242:44.23]Isn't this a fishing spot?
[242:53.38]No, you can have this back.
[242:58.68]So, why can I not... Somebody, we gotta help this guy.
[243:07.77]This, haha, I keep losing stuff is not funny anymore.
[243:16.37]Here, take a crab.
[243:18.64]Haha, I keep losing stuff.

[243:48.93]Look at... Are you going to fish?
[243:50.67]He's going to fish.
[243:54.01]He's going to do it.
[243:58.72]Alright, let's keep moving.
[244:03.03]We are going to examine that.
[244:05.29]Get it into your memory.
[244:10.92]And then forget it.
[244:30.27]No crocodiles.
[244:31.50]Let's go.
[244:43.18]This game is really cool.
[244:44.42]Haters be gone.
[244:47.26]I think this game is really cool.
[244:50.71]I think this is a really, really awesome game.
[244:54.03]Underneath a layer of unintuitive control.
[244:59.83]What?
[245:10.45]Like, this is a... We're talking about fossils.
[245:12.65]This is a fossil that's underneath a layer of fucking sand.
[245:19.99]There's gold under there.
[245:21.73]But you've got to dig down, like, 25 feet to get it.
[245:23.87]Everybody here?
[245:41.78]There it is.
[245:42.47]I found the giant waterfall.
[245:44.19]I'm gonna get a cutscene, right?
[245:45.73]Oh, this is like... Oh, this is an Irish spring!
[245:50.23]It must be an Irish spring!
[246:11.78]I just turn the fucking stream off.
[246:15.04]And I never stream again.
[246:18.60]I make one tweet a year that says, it's an Irish spring.
[246:24.42]You never see me again.
[246:25.42]Something going on here.
[246:33.90]Something going on here.
[246:35.20]Alright.
[246:35.89]Did he pick somebody up?
[246:43.52]What happened?
[246:44.64]We good?
[246:47.44]Why are you all hiding?
[246:52.49]We're supposed to work together as a team.
[246:54.33]God damn it.
[246:59.29]Fucking useless.
[246:59.91]Useless.
[247:00.29]Useless.
[247:00.57]Useless.
[247:01.03]What?
[247:14.05]Something in the water.
[247:15.53]Don't go in the water.
[247:16.76]Stay out of the water.
[247:17.50]Everyone out of the water.
[247:18.70]Don't go in the water.
[247:32.15]What is in the water?
[247:51.02]Hiding spot.
[247:58.30]Alright, we gotta make it... This is the new shelter.
[248:00.74]We're making camp here.
[248:01.89]And then we're gonna evolve.
[248:02.75]I'm pressing the button.
[248:07.49]No, don't make noise!
[248:08.43]Where is it?
[248:09.85]What is it?
[248:14.32]What is it?
[248:15.34]What's the noise here?
[248:17.15]What are we supposed to be looking for?
[248:19.55]I don't know what's wrong.
[248:25.31]I'm starting to get a little scared here.
[248:27.09]Okay, I need... How do I fix a broken leg?
[248:31.47]I gotta sleep.
[248:31.99]Alright.
[248:34.07]Fuck it.
[248:34.44]Make camp.
[248:36.40]I need some sticks.
[248:37.20]I need some twigs.
[248:39.22]I need some yarn.
[248:41.00]Where's our newest recruit?
[248:42.26]Take my stick.
[248:42.62]Take this.
[248:45.93]No, take it.
[248:48.49]Take this.
[248:50.86]What are you holding?
[248:51.52]You have a stick.
[248:52.18]Who doesn't have a stick?
[248:53.10]You, come here.
[248:53.66]You're gonna fucking hurt too.
[249:00.36]Alright.
[249:01.93]It's time to set up shop.
[249:05.39]Okay, where is this thing?
[249:18.74]It spawned!
[249:20.28]Get in the water!
[249:21.44]Everybody get in the water!
[249:24.94]Lions hate water!
[249:25.88]Use your sticks!
[249:33.19]Do something!
[249:37.47]Somebody do something!
[249:39.34]He spawned in!
[249:41.40]Somebody scare him!
[249:42.78]He won't come in the water!
[249:51.36]What was that?
[249:52.60]Why do we all get sucked down?
[249:57.74]Okay.
[249:58.12]I got pulled in like the undertow.
[250:03.58]What is in here?
[250:04.40]It is the undertow, isn't it?
[250:11.33]What is it?
[250:11.73]I don't understand what the problem is.
[250:15.61]Alright, get me the fuck over here.
[250:17.13]I need food.
[250:19.87]He's still here somewhere.
[250:23.90]Is there a cave behind the waterfall?
[250:27.16]Follow me.
[250:30.52]Pick up the orb.
[250:32.32]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[250:40.55]Pick it up.
[250:41.05]What the fuck are you doing?
[250:43.17]Pick up the orb.
[250:45.83]Why can't I get the orb?
[250:50.27]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[250:55.44]It's like, give me, please!
[251:02.64]It's in the background, so was I being lied to about the orb?
[251:08.44]Why is it in my face?
[251:13.54]It's like eclipsing me!
[251:16.12]I... Okay, you explain to me what happened here.
[251:36.42]Eat this.
[251:37.02]Eat this.
[251:37.64]Eat it.
[251:38.18]What is this?
[251:38.60]Eat it.
[251:40.24]I can't eat it.
[251:41.12]Where are my friends?
[251:42.93]Where's food?
[251:43.69]I need food right now.
[251:45.05]Like, I need to eat something right now.
[251:49.91]Fucking tiger spawned in next to the lake.
[251:55.47]I can't eat this.
[251:57.51]Alright.
[252:03.04]What is that?
[252:03.60]Food.
[252:03.80]Food.
[252:10.95]Un-fucking-believable.
[252:13.71]Okay, I need to change.
[252:14.81]I need to switch to you or something.
[252:19.21]My bone is healed, but I'm still... I need the... I need the... That thing up there.
[252:26.26]I can't believe that I got, like, a server admin spawned a fucking tiger on the lake.
[252:37.08]I need to like find one of those things, but I can't carry anything.
[252:42.93]So you get a tiger spawned up your ass.
[252:47.08]And then the tiger kills everybody.
[252:49.34]And then you have to run around like an asshole trying to find like the fruit hanging from the tree to peel your broken bones and shit.
[253:10.54]I'm going out.
[253:11.54]I'm going out.
[253:12.50]I'm going out.
[253:13.16]I'm going out.
[253:13.58]I'm going out.
[253:14.06]Okay, I'm alive.
[253:17.50]What are you doing?
[253:22.10]Give it to me.
[253:34.15]We even brought stuff with us.
[253:38.31]This game.
[253:41.90]Seriously.
[253:43.24]Is anybody else hurt?
[253:44.81]We need to go to bed now.
[253:54.29]I would love to put up a shut-up shop next to the waterfall.
[254:04.12]Come here.
[254:05.38]Who else is injured?
[254:06.90]I can't really tell from here.
[254:08.54]Can everybody get up here?
[254:14.07]Is it just the two of us?
[254:14.85]I'm just going to bring two of them with me.
[254:17.23]Because there's one more here, right?
[254:19.91]Or did I get them both?
[254:21.63]I literally... If there's a tiger here, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[254:34.35]Okay.
[254:43.90]Go get the orb.
[254:44.84]I'm not going to get the fucking orb.
[254:46.58]There is a tiger here.
[254:48.65]Like, hiding in that bush.
[254:50.69]Is it in the rock?
[255:08.21]That's how you regain your sanity?
[255:09.91]Well, I chased one around for 30 seconds, and it just glitched into my screen.
[255:16.07]If you don't get the orb, you go insane.
[255:18.53]Well, why did it not work last time?
[255:27.40]Reach conquer zone.
[255:28.82]Didn't I already do this, though?
[255:29.98]Okay.
[255:40.98]What the fuck are you, what the fuck are you talking about?
[255:43.56]Like it's like inside, where is this?
[255:45.70]Every fucking time!
[256:11.33]Every time!
[256:14.75]Every single fucking time!
[256:17.79]Come on.
[256:21.11]Who's hurt?
[256:23.29]And then I'm gonna... We're gonna have to put... We're gonna make a little camp back here.
[256:33.22]So if you go outside of the waterfall, all of a sudden, you've lost your mind again.
[256:37.86]No, don't go out of there.
[256:39.12]It's not safe out there.
[257:02.36]What the fuck is this talking about?
[257:09.10]I don't understand this.
[257:11.66]I have to conquer my fear of...
[257:15.96]of over there now?
[257:21.52]The water's scary.
[257:30.41]How far away is this?
[257:41.83]Is this it?
[257:44.93]I got it.
[257:46.13]Conquer your fear.
[257:47.41]Conquer your fear!
[258:01.28]Please eat something.
[258:02.50]Who's hurt?
[258:03.84]Anybody have blood on them?
[258:04.78]How are you doing?
[258:05.70]You alright?
[258:07.06]I think you've got blood on you.
[258:08.96]Come here.
[258:10.63]We need to eat.
[258:11.95]This is the worst game I've ever played in my whole life.
[258:15.71]This is the worst game I've ever played.
[258:17.71]This game.
[258:18.27]This game.
[258:18.87]This is probably.
[258:19.83]This is like up there in the top five worst games I've ever played.
[258:33.98]He wasn't even here.
[258:35.86]He's not even here.
[258:39.86]He just spawned!
[258:41.08]This is like the fucking Slender Man!
[258:47.34]How do I attack?
[258:48.16]Oh, he's... Don't you...
[259:15.02]I swear to God.
[259:20.33]It's not fair.
[259:21.91]I was just... Somebody has fucking cheats.
[259:34.90]I've conquered my fear of water.
[259:36.52]Let's drink some.
[259:54.94]Am I drowning in the water?
[260:07.55]Was I drinking too fast?
[260:09.63]Okay.
[260:10.35]Where are the babies?
[260:12.47]Thank God the babies are safe.
[260:16.05]Or at least one of them is.
[260:19.91]Okay, let me... I need to... I need to sleep.
[260:24.77]I need to... I need to... Hey, look.
[260:26.31]Now guess what I have to fucking do.
[260:30.70]I think the tiger's here.
[260:32.84]Again.
[260:36.74]Did you hear that shit?
[260:47.35]I have... I have to go get one of those sky fruits.
[260:51.93]Because I'm bleeding now.
[260:54.98]And when I go to get a sky fruit, I'm gonna get attacked again.
[260:59.53]And then it's gonna eat three people.
[261:02.05]And then I'm gonna have to get another sky fruit.
[261:04.21]And then... Just leave the area.
[261:13.82]That's what I tried to do.
[261:14.99]And then tiger spawn.
[261:18.37]I was very clearly... I looked at every direction.
[261:21.25]And the tiger wasn't there.
[261:22.11]And then all of a sudden... Sorry, I picked up the fourth notebook page.
[261:25.31]So he comes faster.
[261:33.22]And there's none of those things around.
[261:34.54]I might as well just die.
[261:36.42]Just somebody... Alright, I'm going to turn around and just hit me in the back of the fucking head as hard as you can with that thing.
[261:41.56]And then eat me.
[261:43.16]Just eat me.
[261:44.08]All of you.
[261:52.03]Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
[261:57.43]Give this to me.
[262:00.48]Let's make a camp.
[262:01.64]Who cares where it is?
[262:25.48]No, get out of the fucking way!
[262:31.30]Watch out for those gators!
[262:34.68]Alright, can I stomp on this yet?
[262:47.54]Hey, I wonder what it is.
[262:49.58]Is it a tiger?
[262:51.64]Hey, was I just looking in that direction and there was no fucking tiger?
[262:57.61]Does anybody have a spear?
[263:01.19]Give me that thing.
[263:01.89]Give me that spear.
[263:03.71]Give me that fucking thing right now.
[263:05.97]Come here.
[263:07.57]Give me the spear.
[263:09.69]No, stop running.
[263:10.85]Give me the spear.
[263:12.03]You.
[263:13.21]Give me that spear.
[263:14.17]I need that.
[263:15.24]Give it to me.
[263:15.62]Quickly.
[263:17.34]Oh, he's dead, so I'm gonna get the spear anyways.
[263:20.18]Spear?
[263:21.30]Okay, here we go.
[263:23.77]How do you counterattack?
[263:24.55]Do I even have it in my hands anymore?
[263:28.28]Where the fuck is it?
[263:28.78]It's not in my hands!
[263:29.54]I just picked it up!
[263:45.39]What is he smashing?
[263:54.64]He was just hitting something on the ground.
[263:59.20]I don't know what he was hitting.
[264:01.13]He was smashing something's head and... Was he killing another monkey?
[264:07.61]I don't know.
[264:13.30]Oh, hey guys!
[264:15.52]I fancy seeing you all here.
[264:17.92]He made it back.
[264:24.52]Pulled A. Okay, I held A, but the problem was I dropped the spear.
[264:35.34]Pulled A. That's what I did!
[264:38.45]No, you pressed A.
[264:43.46]they've made it X or like right trigger or any other button besides a they couldn't have done it like B
[265:48.10]Everybody's bleeding.
[265:49.94]So let's go across the map to find another one of those healing scrubs.
[266:06.51]And the cycle repeats itself.
[266:22.82]Do I have any spears or anything?
[266:40.96]Okay.
[266:43.30]Reaction time for attacks will be increased.
[266:45.32]Oh, sure.
[267:00.83]Hold A to prime dodging or attack.
[267:04.41]Move left stick to choose direction.
[267:05.87]Release A at the right time to dodge or attack.
[267:26.47]Um, okay.
[267:27.53]So... Do... Dodge towards them to attack.
[267:34.41]But that's been dodging.
[267:36.73]I've been dodging, like, towards these motherfuckers.
[267:45.00]I just got $50 from Phylacter Lich.
[267:46.84]Thank you.
[267:50.23]I'm glad you have a Wendy's nearby, or you'd be fucking dead.
[268:04.40]No, give me a break, though.
[268:05.84]Could I, like, hold A and then tap forward and let go of A?
[268:10.14]Why can't I just have, like, an animation where I fucking bash the motherfucker with, like, X?
[268:16.60]What's this, like, QTE thing?
[268:32.47]Thank you for the $50.
[268:39.16]Is there a sound cue?
[268:40.36]I don't know.
[268:43.50]But I can take care of my own food.
[268:49.41]Trust me on that.
[268:50.09]I know how to cook two things.
[268:53.13]I know how to make a hamburger.
[268:56.26]All the way to well done because I'm too scared to take it off any other point because I think I'll get sick.
[269:01.58]And I know how to make a delicious salmon in the oven.
[269:05.20]You just put a piece of salmon in the oven with some fucking spices and seasoning and some... You put like water sauce and shit all over it and you put it in the oven for like 10-12 minutes.
[269:12.73]You can't fuck it up.
[269:13.25]You just take it out and eat it.
[269:18.51]I also know how to make spaghetti.
[269:20.27]Al dente.
[269:21.41]It's four minutes.
[269:23.44]Although I do have to be careful because one time I did make my famous crunchy al dente spaghetti for a family get-together, and four people chipped their teeth.
[269:33.61]And I'm still dealing with that family lawsuit to this day.
[269:36.67]So I've got to be careful.
[269:37.65]I've got to be more aware.
[269:47.76]Anyways, thanks for the 50 bucks, and thank you Great Canadian FK Club for the 10 subs.
[269:51.14]Appreciate it.
[269:56.18]Hold A to prime to dodge or attack.
[269:58.96]Move left stick to choose a direction.
[270:01.52]Let go at A at the right time to dodge or counterattack.
[270:06.60]I am just gonna go kill something.
[270:09.76]I'm ready.
[270:13.98]Deck stick and more desk, yeah.
[270:17.80]This is what happened to me last time!
[270:20.00]Everybody thought I was lying!
[270:21.08]Everybody thought I was a liar!
[270:22.89]I dodged and I dropped my fucking axe!
[270:25.11]Once connected, the chances of dropping an item when a dodge happens will decrease.
[270:28.07]I dodged and it dropped the fucking axe on the ground.
[270:30.11]Like, what was I supposed to do?
[270:31.25]I don't have enough power yet.
[270:41.65]Alright, I want that.
[270:44.31]I want that to follow in future generations.
[270:54.54]There's an audio cue for counter-attacking.
[270:56.48]You have to do it towards the enemy.
[270:58.40]What's with the fucking audio cues?
[271:04.74]Phylactery let you get another $50.
[271:08.25]What am I doing?
[271:15.15]Everybody go home!
[271:16.29]I have four holes in my body!
[271:30.64]They didn't make it.
[271:32.02]They didn't make it.
[271:52.36]I sent them all home.
[271:54.52]They fucking died in front of me.
[272:09.45]Are they just standing on top of... Alright, it's just you and me.
[272:14.55]And you.
[272:23.04]I need a spear or something.
[272:27.22]Give me that.
[272:27.80]I need to heal.
[272:30.06]Is this thing sharpened?
[272:31.08]It is not.
[272:31.90]Thank God there's somebody still alive.
[272:34.34]Alright.
[272:35.48]Give me that rock.
[272:36.78]Here we go.
[272:37.18]I'm not... I am not fucking around now.
[272:41.05]I'm gonna do this.
[272:46.97]Restart?
[272:47.85]What do you mean, restart?
[273:02.72]We're going... and we're killing us... a lion.
[273:08.14]And the expedition.
[273:08.80]I just did.
[273:09.18]I just did and they all died.
[273:11.00]I already did the expedition.
[273:24.71]Yeah, there are too many bodies lying around in bones.
[273:28.97]Okay.
[273:30.65]Now I have to go get... One of those things.
[273:39.18]Let's go.
[273:40.24]Hurry up.
[273:42.88]Eat the other bodies.
[273:44.08]I can't do that.
[273:55.41]Why do these things have to be so far away from where I am?
[274:02.33]Evolve.
[274:02.73]Evolve.
[274:03.21]Alright, I'm evolving.
[274:04.65]Fuck it.
[274:05.29]I got two kids here.
[274:06.11]Evolve.
[274:06.93]I'm done.
[274:07.48]I'm done.
[274:20.16]Keep that acute response.
[274:23.36]And I think that's all I can do right now.
[274:25.36]Evolve.
[274:27.67]Change generation.
[274:28.33]Let's go.
[274:29.85]I got nothing else I can put it in.
[274:31.15]Let's go.
[274:31.69]Yeah.
[274:32.92]Go.
[274:51.64]I got two kids.
[274:53.72]But Phylactery, thank you for the hundred bucks.
[274:56.22]Thank you, for real.
[274:58.34]That's a shitload of money.
[274:59.54]And Great Canadian FK Club.
[275:02.74]Thanks, both of you.
[275:06.50]Another 15 years.
[275:15.67]Okay.
[275:16.69]We're in year 35.
[275:17.35]How we doing?
[275:26.93]okay we're good we need to have some more kids everybody with the bones no okay give me my I need a spear I'm gonna go try to kill something this is gonna take a while I hope I'm not the only one alive
[276:01.60]No.
[276:01.92]There are at least a couple other here.
[276:04.27]Alright, here we go.
[276:10.59]I'm going to get one of these.
[276:14.85]There's one.
[276:16.97]I'm going to just have them at the base.
[276:18.91]I'm going to go pick them up.
[276:20.01]Just go get them.
[276:27.56]Nobody follow me.
[276:28.44]I'm just going to do it by myself.
[276:38.99]How come you're not taking the spear that you made 15 years ago?
[276:42.71]It's dull.
[276:51.50]Alright, where... Do I need to keep going up?
[276:53.96]Where the hell were those?
[276:54.76]There's eggs up there.
[276:58.20]Maybe we should get those too.
[276:59.28]No, that's just a branch.
[277:07.97]What about this?
[277:08.41]Is this like a new species of plant or something?
[277:11.99]No.
[277:16.12]Bird?
[277:17.14]Can I like identify the bird?
[277:18.28]Let's go up here.
[277:37.60]These have to be so high up.
[277:39.24]You can't just put these, like, on the ground.
[277:40.84]I hate me.
[277:46.24]Consume the bird?
[277:47.18]I don't think I can do that.
[278:45.66]You just like sometimes you just have to like take a leap of faith and I'm gonna die I'm gonna fall off and die probably
[278:53.49]I just was trying to get this shit.
[278:55.65]And sometimes it's hard to tell what's even grabbable and what's not grabbable.
[278:58.87]Like, I can't grab those.
[278:59.87]I can only grab the vines?
[279:01.84]I can grab the trunks?
[279:02.66]I can grab the branches?
[279:15.50]I don't even, like, fucking remember.
[279:19.03]Where, like, just... I'm gonna just go all the way to the top of the damn tree.
[279:28.69]This isn't Assassin's Creed.
[279:29.67]It was made by the same guy that made Assassin's Creed.
[279:32.82]It may as well be.
[279:33.70]Oh.
[279:46.02]Give me that.
[279:46.52]How can I stand?
[280:10.16]Do I have to sleep to cure a broken bone?
[280:16.00]Fuck you, bird.
[280:19.73]I almost got him.
[280:21.19]Damn it.
[280:26.56]Give me the other one.
[280:28.14]I have two of these things now.
[280:29.58]That's all I wanted.
[280:51.96]What are you doing?
[281:00.45]The red or green plant will heal bones?
[281:08.43]Where can I find one of those?
[281:10.52]I guess I'm just going to have to... I want just to bring these back to Habit Camp.
[281:22.56]There's one over there This game we go with multiplayer
[281:54.39]I've been playing for about five hours.
[281:55.95]I still don't understand what the fuck the point of the game is.
[281:58.59]When we're supposed to... What?
[282:02.68]That you just... You just exist?
[282:04.78]Let's just live.
[282:11.82]To evolve.
[282:13.09]Into what?
[282:31.48]Become a caveman?
[282:32.40]Is that even in the game?
[282:34.10]No.
[282:37.94]What do you mean, no?
[282:57.05]Are you just a monkey the whole time?
[283:08.52]Yes.
[283:09.10]No.
[283:11.02]No?
[283:11.48]Yeah, no.
[283:12.24]We're getting some 50-50 responses here.
[283:15.58]Alright, here's the red thing that I wanted.
[283:36.03]Is this working?
[283:46.41]What's wrong with me?
[284:13.87]My phone is re-broken.
[284:34.23]I was just trying to fix myself.
[284:43.46]And I'm poisoned from the berries.
[284:46.50]What happened?
[285:00.17]Time to evolve.
[285:07.16]I don't have any children, guys.
[285:13.75]Who even is this?
[285:15.43]And where are they?
[285:26.98]That was kind of sad.
[285:27.98]Yeah, it was.
[285:30.02]Restart the game with your knowledge of how to play.
[285:37.13]Should I just do that?
[285:54.43]But I'm not sure I have that much knowledge on how to play the game.
[285:57.70]Do you understand?
[286:00.60]I don't think I have the knowledge you're referring to.
[286:25.92]Read the... No, I know, like, the basic understanding, but... Should I just restart?
[286:35.39]Read the help section?
[286:39.91]No, I know all... I mean, we did this already.
[286:42.27]Yeah, like, I understand this stuff.
[286:58.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[287:05.10]Okay.
[287:05.62]When you access the neural network, you use the neural energy generated by surviving to grow the neurons, okay?
[287:09.52]It will increase your latent capacities.
[287:11.62]When you access your neural network ready for reinforcement, it means you can pass generations, right?
[287:15.95]Okay.
[287:21.51]But we already knew that.
[287:24.34]The problem has not been about progressing in the game, the problem has been running into tigers that spawn on top of me.
[287:44.96]The combat page?
[287:47.06]The combat page is two sentences!
[288:01.53]Hold A to prime dodging.
[288:03.43]Release A. What do you mean release?
[288:06.72]I just read them.
[288:21.70]I know.
[288:22.45]I already knew that shit.
[288:25.87]What's that?
[288:26.31]Listen.
[288:26.95]Hmm.
[288:28.37]Hmm.
[288:32.80]What's your heartbeat?
[288:34.58]A boar?
[289:03.15]I ain't giving up.
[289:04.07]Not yet.
[289:04.47]Nope.
[289:05.25]I ain't giving up.
[289:30.04]Who died over there?
[289:30.70]Okay, somebody died there.
[289:33.28]What?
[289:49.36]I can already read the patch notes for version 1.1.
[289:52.87]Reduce the spawn rate of the tiger by like 30 fucking thousand percent.
[290:22.61]This is the last one.
[290:24.04]This is the only monkey I have left.
[290:29.56]Hold and release.
[290:31.36]I'm gonna ban the word.
[290:32.38]I'm gonna ban the word hold and release.
[290:36.13]I didn't have a spirit in my hand.
[290:37.39]And by the way, even... I'm banning the word.
[290:39.89]I'm banning hold and release.
[290:56.31]Hold and release does not stop the fact that I'm surrounded by... There are more tigers than people!
[291:12.01]There's another monkey over there, I think.
[291:21.54]Found him!
[291:26.03]Hey, you.
[291:27.57]Follow me.
[291:29.39]You and me are friends now.
[291:31.05]You understand?
[291:31.65]Let's go.
[291:36.51]People are donating to say that.
[291:38.71]Don't even do that.
[291:39.75]That's a waste of money.
[291:41.29]Don't do that.
[291:41.89]Okay.
[291:47.01]Follow me.
[291:48.37]There's two of us.
[291:48.91]Wait.
[291:49.85]What are you?
[291:50.71]Are you female?
[291:51.55]Male?
[291:51.81]Am I male?
[291:52.25]Are you female?
[291:52.79]What is it?
[291:53.79]Let me know.
[291:55.47]I'm doing this.
[291:56.17]I'm starting over.
[291:57.75]In mid-game.
[291:59.02]Come here.
[292:01.52]What are you?
[292:04.58]Male.
[292:04.98]What am I?
[292:06.70]Who am I?
[292:07.08]What am I?
[292:13.24]Shit.
[292:13.90]No, wait.
[292:14.50]That's good.
[292:15.48]Right?
[292:16.52]Yes.
[292:16.84]That's good.
[292:17.30]Come here.
[292:19.62]Yes.
[292:21.26]Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[292:26.42]We can start over.
[292:27.14]We can do this.
[292:27.64]You and I. Come on.
[292:35.92]Come here.
[292:38.23]No.
[292:38.59]I'm trying to turn off the emote only mode.
[292:44.57]How do I turn?
[292:45.05]I don't.
[292:45.49]I know how to turn it on.
[292:46.07]I know how to turn it off.
[292:54.47]Got it.
[292:55.03]Okay.
[292:57.79]Okay.
[292:58.05]Now, I need a bed.
[293:01.77]Okay, we already got some stuff here.
[293:08.90]There's sticks here.
[293:24.63]I see a couple of rocks.
[293:29.15]I just want to make a bed or... No, just follow me back.
[293:32.37]We're already here.
[293:33.09]There's one, two, three, four dead up there.
[293:37.49]There's so many dead people up here.
[293:51.09]This doesn't feel right.
[293:52.37]I don't think I can... I don't think we can have kids up here.
[293:55.26]This doesn't feel right.
[294:41.10]Evolve first?
[294:42.04]Didn't I already do that?
[294:44.41]Like, I'm talking like an hour, like 45 minutes ago now.
[294:48.09]Didn't I do that already?
[294:48.99]Because I don't have any points.
[295:16.66]Can't reach here.
[295:18.02]No.
[295:25.03]I have nothing else to do.
[295:27.71]I need to survive out there with kids around me.
[295:31.91]But surviving out there is deemed to be very, very, very difficult.
[295:45.52]Evolution leap.
[295:51.05]What is this?
[295:56.18]When evolving through ages, all spontaneous mutation neurons that got not carried by adults are eligible to vanish, but then matter may reappear in future babies.
[296:02.96]Do you still want to evolve?
[296:08.25]Just what the fuck even is this?
[296:23.78]What?
[296:25.78]What?
[296:27.02]What?
[296:27.98]What?
[296:28.98]There was nothing told me about that.
[296:31.90]Zero.
[296:33.74]It did not tell me to do this.
[296:35.36]24,000 fucking years?
[296:39.31]24,000 more years.
[296:39.83]Obsidian is a tool.
[296:40.41]I used it twice.
[296:54.63]Yeah, I intimidated a warthog.
[296:56.71]We gained 50,000 years.
[297:07.86]Is there a reason why the game would not tell you that this existed?
[297:13.42]It's going too fast!
[297:21.61]Oh shit!
[297:23.29]I'm gonna be sick!
[297:32.09]I would... I even looked at this screen.
[297:35.95]And I thought these were just like achievements.
[297:42.32]Dude, I don't... This is happening.
[297:43.66]There's too much happening on the screen right now.
[297:45.04]I don't know what's going on.
[297:47.14]It's almost a million years.
[297:53.86]The game doesn't tell you mechanics so you learn?
[297:57.29]I don't think this is a game mechanic.
[297:58.73]I think this is a menu option.
[298:03.30]Game mechanic would be like finding herbs and spices and shit.
[298:10.14]I think this is a very important screen to know what it does.
[298:39.55]This is five hours of stuff.
[298:41.55]You've 102,000 evolved faster than science.
[298:44.77]I went 819,000 years.
[298:49.21]What?
[298:49.89]Hey, wait, that's not fair.
[299:15.06]evolving slow okay more deaths than births so that means you don't exist you have moved forward through time to nine to four million whatever years before now and will be brought back to the world to catch up with your lineage
[299:41.35]That is an insanely important fucking core game.
[299:46.45]That, not, well you didn't know it existed either.
[299:49.82]Neither did I.
[300:10.18]Why is it year 36?
[300:10.86]Did anything change?
[300:30.41]Who am I?
[300:30.93]Anybody here?
[300:39.07]Is it just... Am I the only one that made it?
[300:43.13]Where's my bed?
[300:58.62]Okay.
[300:59.74]Who are you?
[301:00.22]Adult female.
[301:02.29]Alright, I...
[301:09.62]I'm going out on my own.
[301:13.22]Ooh, new thing.
[301:27.99]I can't fucking believe I was there for five hours and didn't know.
[301:31.53]I can't- I can't believe it.
[301:34.73]I am fucking- I am shocked right now.
[301:53.87]Alright, get the honey.
[301:55.25]Get it.
[301:56.03]How do I get honey?
[301:57.87]Ooh, okay.
[302:03.33]I got some more senses.
[302:07.74]Can you grab it?
[302:08.36]I don't think you can grab honey.
[302:12.75]You need to do a couple more feats to evolve as a species.
[302:17.17]Okay.
[302:20.67]So let's just grab a few sticks and do the thing I did already.
[302:23.59]Strip the weeds.
[302:26.67]I know how to... No, I don't know how to do that, apparently.
[302:29.49]Alright, what do I want to do?
[302:30.73]I need to go over here?
[302:33.20]Find one of these other things?
[302:34.96]Let's go this way.
[302:47.74]Can't wait to find the evolved tiger.
[302:49.21]Yeah Dude that shit was un-fucking-believable You okay?
[303:04.42]I need to help you.
[303:06.48]I got a headache.
[303:08.16]What can I do for a headache?
[303:10.48]Something for a headache?
[303:18.09]That's not food and looking for war.
[303:19.77]It's something.
[303:20.29]Let me just.
[303:25.37]No.
[303:29.52]No.
[304:10.76]I can't.
[304:11.74]What do I do?
[304:51.91]Why is he still alive?
[304:53.61]Get off of him!
[305:11.86]Run away, you idiot!
[305:13.43]Stupid dumb tiger!
[305:14.37]Is he alright?
[306:05.07]What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, guys?
[306:13.62]I'm just gonna remember.
[306:24.27]Can I not climb up any of this?
[306:40.93]Alright, I did, I did my... Did it work?
[306:48.98]It worked.
[306:50.34]From this far away.
[306:51.16]Uh, okay.
[306:54.64]Let me, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[306:55.62]Okay, this is, uh, this is, this is fruits and shit.
[306:57.59]I need to heal.
[307:07.78]I think I need a rock to break these open.
[307:10.64]I don't think I can just eat these.
[307:12.58]I'm pretty sure I can't.
[307:14.60]Where did they even go?
[307:15.34]No, I can't.
[307:17.71]I'm gonna bring these.
[307:20.01]We're gonna smash it with a rock.
[307:23.57]I'm gonna give them to him.
[307:24.31]Because the tiger's gone.
[307:26.19]Where are the other two that fell?
[307:27.35]Right here?
[307:35.40]Where the fuck are these things?
[307:37.68]Okay, I got one, apparently.
[307:41.56]Where... I'm bleeding out.
[307:56.26]I know, but I have to go get one of these fucking things.
[307:58.34]It's the story of my life.
[308:19.69]No fall joke?
[308:20.77]No.
[308:27.30]You healed yourself from bleeding.
[308:28.68]That's a feat.
[308:29.66]I need a couple more feats.
[308:32.96]Can I break this open?
[308:35.96]Metabolism.
[308:46.51]What exactly am I doing to this?
[308:49.34]Oh, the nut!
[308:51.34]The big nut!
[308:57.39]Let's break this open and eat it.
[308:58.33]It's a coconut.
[309:11.30]Okay, can I do anything else with this?
[309:12.72]Can I... I think I do have to smash this with a rock, I think.
[309:18.46]Yeah, okay, I can smash it with a rock.
[309:22.18]Is he still alive?
[309:30.80]Tiger's gone, right?
[309:32.48]Give me a rock so I can break this open.
[309:47.74]Any rock will do.
[309:49.14]Any rock will do.
[309:50.17]I'll take any rock in the whole world.
[309:52.67]On Earth.
[309:53.39]Any rock will do.
[309:55.83]I wish I could pick you up.
[309:58.22]I need a rock.
[310:00.04]So I can give this to you.
[310:18.12]I wish I could put, like, some- I wish I had, like, a monkey inventory.
[310:22.22]Because now I gotta find a rock.
[310:36.90]Give me, please.
[310:37.80]He's really hungry.
[310:39.00]Right here.
[310:40.02]No, those are mushrooms.
[310:40.84]Just eat them.
[310:41.52]No, don't eat those!
[310:42.12]Ahhhh!
[310:51.55]Ooh!
[310:51.93]Hold on, berries.
[310:55.07]Are these poisonous?
[310:57.11]Hey, I learned self-control.
[311:17.52]Would have loved to give you a berry.
[311:21.17]But I- I- That guy's- I'm gonna have to leave him.
[311:30.55]Just put everything down and fucking get out of here.
[311:48.83]I can't even get up the fucking tree!
[311:52.67]Climb the tree!
[312:05.68]I'm learning dodge.
[312:07.36]Well, that's good.
[312:07.90]I'm just farming points.
[312:09.06]What, did we have the stream drop?
[312:19.14]We're good.
[312:34.41]Guess what I need now.
[312:35.25]I need another one of those things to rub on my fucking body.
[312:41.91]And he's just guarding this fucking tiger.
[312:45.25]It's always around no matter what you do or where you go.
[312:49.53]There's always a tiger.
[312:50.85]There's always a fucking tiger.
[312:53.77]Tigers come out like for five minutes a day, guys.
[312:56.35]They don't fucking do this.
[312:59.67]And then they go to stay asleep.
[313:03.23]Where even is that?
[313:14.77]I have no, like, depth here.
[313:20.53]What am I looking at?
[313:21.09]What are you looking at?
[313:23.09]What are you looking at?
[313:23.86]What are you looking at?
[313:24.58]What are you looking at?
[313:26.16]What?
[313:28.12]Oh, it's been a whole day.
[313:28.98]Okay.
[313:33.91]Is he still just down?
[313:34.85]Of course he's down there.
[313:36.43]Just always expect that there's always a tiger.
[313:39.55]Everywhere, no matter what.
[313:52.64]This whole game is tigers.
[313:55.80]Ancestors.
[313:58.46]How monkeys ran away from tigers.
[314:01.44]Based on four bones we found.
[314:08.98]Okay, can I heal this guy?
[314:11.16]That's not gonna hurt me, right?
[314:19.93]Thank god.
[314:20.71]Okay, come here, please.
[314:23.65]What the fuck was that?
[314:25.33]What just happened?
[314:26.81]What hap- did- how did my character die?
[314:34.29]I wasn't bleeding, I just healed myself!
[314:38.02]I just healed myself!
[314:51.01]I'm just trying- alright, no more rescuing other people!
[315:01.51]The tiger shot me.
[315:22.70]God damn it.
[315:28.26]Well, I... Shit.
[315:45.68]Your circle was so minuscule that the act of walking killed you.
[315:50.87]Well, that sucks.
[315:53.91]Is this water?
[315:54.45]Let me just drink some of this water.
[316:00.14]You get zero XP unless you have a baby on your back.
[316:07.24]Am I scared of the water too?
[316:11.59]What is it?
[316:11.95]What am I looking at here?
[316:12.85]Lily pads?
[316:13.41]Are you scared of lily pads?
[316:21.21]No, it's a fishing spot.
[316:23.16]So what's the problem?
[316:23.98]Relax!
[316:44.42]Alright, where... Let me go over here.
[316:46.02]I'm just gonna sleep.
[316:52.00]Do I have a thing here?
[316:52.90]I mean, this is where he spawned.
[316:57.43]Is there a bed?
[316:58.03]Alright, am I gonna have to make one?
[317:13.86]Stay in the trees?
[317:15.22]Well, I would love to stay in the trees, but half the stuff I have to do, I have to be on the ground.
[317:25.95]Dig in this hole!
[317:26.75]Pick up this rock!
[317:30.84]Grab a stick off the plant!
[317:55.14]Okay, I can dig.
[317:56.18]I can dig.
[317:58.08]I need a stick.
[318:00.62]I also need to go to sleep somewhere.
[318:02.44]I don't even know where the hell that even is.
[318:08.94]I guess I have a camp somewhere.
[318:13.59]I'm here.
[318:14.07]Might as well put it on the... Whatever.
[318:16.77]Just sleep on the floor?
[318:19.03]Hold on, let me go... There's like other people... There's like apes over here.
[318:34.74]Where is this other person on the map?
[318:39.20]Who the fuck is this?
[318:40.28]Where are you?
[318:40.86]Is this a... Are you just lying?
[318:45.12]You're like camouflage.
[318:46.02]It's a baby!
[318:47.12]Come here!
[318:48.30]Alright.
[318:52.38]Baby.
[318:54.44]Time to learn.
[319:10.35]What am I gonna do now?
[319:26.84]I'm teaching the baby about the world.
[319:50.77]Okay.
[319:53.91]So this is, I don't know, I don't think I have anybody left.
[319:58.40]I need to find somebody.
[320:00.84]So here's how the course of action is going to be.
[320:03.02]Find somebody that's in need of a new clan.
[320:07.38]Start to the process of getting to know them.
[320:10.32]And then we both die by a tiger in 10 seconds.
[320:12.68]So let's just, you know, continue the same cycle we've been doing for the last like two and a half hours.
[320:30.50]That sounds good to me.
[320:34.37]Let's get a rock and make this a spear, and then we have to go find something.
[320:38.75]I need to sleep, too.
[320:43.67]Get off the tree.
[320:46.67]Okay.
[320:59.34]Sharp.
[321:01.02]I need a rock.
[321:12.27]Teach the baby about taxes.
[321:15.15]I think we're just gonna sleep somewhere.
[321:18.11]Can I sleep in a tree?
[321:19.11]I didn't want to do that.
[321:31.52]We can't just sleep all the way up there.
[321:32.72]Yeah, I know.
[321:38.86]I'm trying to find a place to sleep.
[321:40.68]I have to... Sleep in the bird's nest.
[321:55.44]Now I gotta find sticks.
[321:57.52]Make a bed.
[322:00.48]Or go up and sleep.
[322:01.72]Let me try to sleep in a tree.
[322:07.68]Can I, like, just find a spot where we can lie down?
[322:10.08]I don't think so.
[322:29.11]I have to make a bed.
[322:33.88]Make the bed on the tree?
[322:35.62]That's going to be a pain in the ass, because I have to bring two individual sticks up here.
[322:40.36]Like, five of them.
[322:41.34]And then stomp on it.
[322:44.79]But, I'll try.
[322:45.95]Well, there's a rock.
[322:50.85]I need that.
[323:19.63]Don't pass out while I do this.
[323:22.61]Don't pass out.
[323:29.00]Alright, I got a weapon.
[323:31.34]I need some sticks.
[323:37.74]Rocks, no sticks, no like le- I need like leaves.
[323:43.28]I need to eat something too.
[323:48.16]I got... Let's go find it.
[323:58.53]Go tiger hunting.
[323:59.43]It's revenge time.
[324:00.98]I'm not gonna kill that tiger.
[324:02.80]There's not a chance in hell.
[324:06.20]Okay, right here.
[324:08.06]Put down branch.
[324:09.36]Give me another one.
[324:10.76]Is there any more?
[324:11.27]That's the only thing that was here.
[324:26.45]Tiger joke waiting room.
[324:29.67]Yeah.
[324:36.95]Don't worry, you'll see it again.
[324:38.21]Give me fish.
[325:03.57]Switching hands every time.
[325:06.53]It's just... What the hell?
[325:09.87]Why would you have... Why do I have to switch fucking hands for everything?
[325:15.33]I can't do this with my other hand?
[325:27.97]If I could do it with my right hand, why would I not be smart enough to know I could do the same thing with my other hand?
[325:43.32]Because it's dumb.
[325:44.12]Alright.
[325:48.78]Okay, where is my... Right-handed?
[325:56.48]Yeah.
[325:57.00]I mean, like, ultra right-handed.
[325:58.92]I want... Give me this.
[326:03.76]Is this ready?
[326:04.18]Okay.
[326:12.75]Keep that in the pile.
[326:13.49]It's not ready.
[326:13.99]I need, like, one more.
[326:16.00]I can get that.
[326:25.60]Oh, sorry, Josh!
[326:33.96]I did it with the wrong hand!
[326:49.80]Baby's hungry.
[326:50.16]Doesn't the baby eat when you eat?
[326:53.07]Oh, I got rock.
[327:00.63]Here we go.
[327:09.26]A, up, and then let go of A.
[328:01.92]Wait a minute.
[328:02.66]This is the final baby.
[328:10.49]I need to live.
[328:14.93]Climb something.
[328:15.53]Climb a tree.
[328:33.79]Where is he?
[328:34.99]Why is it still doing this?
[328:39.33]Why are you doing this?
[328:50.54]The tiger cannot climb trees.
[329:06.48]Speaking of trees... I need food.
[329:11.91]I need to eat something.
[329:15.76]I still hear the tigers screaming.
[329:35.38]Find a hiding spot.
[329:39.44]I mean, I think this looks like a hiding spot to me.
[329:57.40]The fucking orb is up here.
[329:59.72]Okay?
[330:01.32]So, try and tell me that I'm not- The orb is in the fucking sky!
[330:12.46]No, I'm not jumping.
[330:13.68]No.
[330:17.20]I gotta find the monkey.
[330:20.76]He's pretty good.
[330:22.18]He's pretty good.
[330:23.18]He's pretty strong.
[330:30.62]Oop.
[330:37.16]I heard the tiger.
[330:46.75]Just like in Dark Souls.
[330:49.47]Dark Souls 1.
[330:51.94]The tree.
[330:59.88]What are you doing?
[331:00.98]Let go!
[331:02.18]Turn this way!
[331:05.33]I'm not even holding onto anything!
[331:18.40]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[331:20.35]Tiger's still waiting for me down here.
[332:20.36]I'm looking for like a hiding spot or something.
[332:31.24]I'm good.
[332:31.54]Okay, get up.
[332:48.87]A tiger is doing great.
[332:51.01]Yes, he is.
[333:08.69]Dead.
[333:09.99]Fish.
[333:11.87]Rock.
[333:18.12]Can I pick stuff up as a baby?
[333:19.33]Holy shit, I can.
[333:24.31]Why can I do this?
[333:25.71]I can't strip it, though.
[333:28.21]Where's the... I can't.
[333:37.54]I need somebody to do this for me.
[333:40.30]I gotta make a bed?
[333:41.02]No, I can't be on the ground for more than fucking 30 seconds, otherwise... The bed was over here.
[333:51.27]Can I sleep into an adult?
[334:25.91]Why did I go back here?
[334:31.54]If I die, the game ends.
[334:34.92]Yeah, I think I'm alright with that.
[334:52.69]Oh, wrong item!
[335:11.24]I can't pick up the fucking spear.
[335:13.64]I'm trying to pick the spear up.
[335:16.66]I got it!
[335:17.00]I got the spear!
[335:30.94]No, there's no... Every button is fucking A. Pick up, jump, run, fall down.
[335:35.72]No way.
[335:40.93]I don't even know where it went.
[335:55.52]I want to just grab the spear and see if I can stab him.
[336:02.25]This is like... No, this is like...
[336:36.84]I can't find a tiger as a baby.
[336:38.16]What about my options?
[336:42.68]Where does this start?
[336:43.26]I haven't seen that on planet Earth yet.
[336:56.08]Never mind.
[337:04.25]No, I'm just a fucking baby again.
[337:18.55]Come on motherfucker, let's go.

[337:52.87]Okay, so hold A. Towards him.
[337:57.49]Audio cue.
[337:58.51]Let go of A. I probably should know what this does first.
[338:09.50]As a baby.
[338:11.96]No, I know what this is.
[338:14.06]I saw Dad do this.
