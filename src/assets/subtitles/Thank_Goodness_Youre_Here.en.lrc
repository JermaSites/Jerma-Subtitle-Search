[ve:60.16.100]

[00:41.16]Hey, I'm on time.
[00:43.37]Exactly at 12 o'clock.
[00:46.15]Precisely when I said this was going to go down.
[00:51.91]How the heck are you?
[00:52.55]How you been?
[00:58.72]It's been what?
[00:59.96]Two months?
[01:01.54]Maybe like a month and a half?
[01:02.44]A little bit longer?
[01:06.64]Got to be somewhere in the first week of August.
[01:08.76]July?
[01:09.14]July?
[01:12.17]Gosh, time sure does fly.
[01:18.13]Yeah, I had my birthday.
[01:19.69]Birthday was good.
[01:20.43]I got one more year until I turn to fucking dust.
[01:26.86]The big one is next time.
[01:29.22]Not quite at the big one yet.
[01:38.65]I remember relatives turning 40.
[01:43.58]And I remember everybody, you know, you'd have the funny cards.
[01:46.00]I was like, oh, you're an old fart now.
[01:48.80]Oh, you're over the hill.
[01:51.38]And I remember thinking, oh, over the hill.
[01:52.70]Wow, that's really old.
[01:55.26]We're celebrating people getting incredibly old.
[01:59.04]That's what I thought when I was younger.
[02:00.02]You know, like a teenager.
[02:03.54]Now that I'm almost there.
[02:07.23]I feel alright.
[02:07.97]I feel pretty good.
[02:09.17]I mean, I've had some health bullshit the last, you know, let's call it five to seven years, but... Hey, hey, hey.
[02:18.18]Could be way worse, right?
[02:19.58]Could be worse.
[02:25.94]I haven't even fucking begun yet.
[02:30.68]You should see how I cut the fucking grass.
[02:34.08]Yeah, thanks for the birthday wishes.
[02:35.38]Appreciate it.
[02:37.48]Otto is doing okay.
[02:39.66]Otto's doing good.
[02:40.33]For those of you that do not know, I'm going to give a quick little update on little Otto.
[02:46.63]Otto... I want to say back in June.
[02:50.05]It's been a long time.
[02:52.29]Back in June, Otto started sneezing.
[02:56.61]and it kind of didn't stop he got kind of worse he got kind of better we were trying to figure out what the hell was going on uh he's had a ton of problems over the last couple of months
[03:09.64]But what he's being effectively with the diagnosis is now, he doesn't have, we tested him for nasal cancer.
[03:17.12]He had biopsies.
[03:19.12]He had scans of his head.
[03:21.26]It's been, it's been a lot over the last couple of months, I'd say.
[03:25.29]But we're kind of in a weird position because he has what is called, and I'm going to, I'm literally reading this because it is in, I can't even pronounce it.
[03:35.59]Idiopathic lymphoplasmatic rhinitis.
[03:41.35]And unfortunately, it's actually a very hard condition to treat.
[03:44.13]So...
[03:48.46]It's been a little, it's been rough.
[03:49.44]I think this whole year has been kind of rough.
[03:52.52]It's kind of been one thing after the other.
[03:54.84]So, kind of just trying to climb out of the bunker and get kind of back to some kind of normalcy, right?
[04:01.14]But he's doing better.
[04:02.08]I really thought, I want to say back in the middle of August, he had a pretty big seizure.
[04:08.18]He's Addisonian.
[04:09.18]He has Addison's, if you don't know, where stress can really fuck him up.
[04:14.30]But he is comfortable.
[04:16.14]He's happy.
[04:17.64]He's good.
[04:19.16]And we're going to keep trying to treat this chronic rhinitis, whatever it is.
[04:24.03]So he's doing good.
[04:26.59]Look, he was running around earlier.
[04:28.45]He's got energy still.
[04:30.39]He just has this problem.
[04:33.53]And I think we're getting into that period where he is 14.
[04:38.23]He's getting older.
[04:38.93]You know, he's up there.
[04:42.15]But I'm going to, you know, he's my little buddy.
[04:45.49]He's my little shadow.
[04:48.13]And I'm going to take care of him as long as I can.
[04:52.04]So, he's doing good.
[04:55.12]He's actually literally right here.
[04:58.68]He's a precious old man.
[05:02.53]And I got my own health bullshit too.
[05:04.33]It's kind of like, at some point it's like, hey, right there with you.
[05:11.18]Talk about like mystery illnesses, right?
[05:12.95]That are hard to treat.
[05:14.93]I've been going down my own path of what the hell's been wrong with me the last five years, right?
[05:20.81]But anyways, let's not dwell on that.
[05:23.77]We're here now.
[05:25.09]We're chilling.
[05:27.14]I'm going to just relax.
[05:28.14]We're going to hang out.
[05:28.86]We're going to talk a bunch of fucking shit.
[05:34.36]Don't think we're not going to be talking shit.
[05:38.04]We're going to play this game.
[05:39.12]It's called Thank Goodness You're Here.
[05:42.12]It's a British game about life in Great Britain, I think.
[05:50.34]I have absolutely no idea.
[05:52.32]It just looked cute.
[05:54.38]And I was like, hey, why not do that?
[05:56.10]That sounds like a good plan to me.
[06:04.41]Oh, yeah.
[06:05.45]We love talking shit over here.
[06:15.24]I want to play a UFO 50.
[06:18.64]That looks kind of fun too.
[06:19.50]It's like the old... It's like a retro... It's like a pretend retro compilation game.
[06:27.97]That looks pretty good.
[06:33.49]Hey, is this the guy from the servers?
[06:37.91]Nah, you're thinking of somebody else.
[06:39.92]You're thinking of somebody else.
[06:47.96]Probably just heard that.
[06:49.56]That was probably so close.
[06:52.56]Alright, that may have sounded like I was being strangled.
[06:59.26]I'm fine.
[06:59.80]I'm here.
[07:00.18]I'm sitting here.
[07:01.02]That was just a Gatorade.
[07:05.97]Yeah, I hope everyone's doing well.
[07:07.53]It's been a while.
[07:09.49]Let's do it.
[07:10.77]I'm ready to play.
[07:13.97]Dude, Sony TV, full screen.
[07:19.66]Sony TV 30.
[07:20.28]What does that even mean?
[07:31.43]Oh, that's like the bug, right?
[07:32.53]That's like the monitor, right?
[07:35.33]Is it 30 FPS?
[07:38.17]Shouldn't be, hold on.
[07:38.97]30 FPS, what?
[07:52.06]Oh, okay.
[07:52.58]No, we're good.
[07:55.48]I hope it's about 30 FPS.
[07:58.02]That fucking hurt my head.
[07:59.42]That was really loud.
[08:00.38]And you probably picked it.
[08:01.24]It probably picked up through the microphone.
[08:03.86]So let's go ahead and make sure that that doesn't happen to you because it just happened to me.
[08:08.08]You know what I mean?
[08:09.74]That hurt.
[08:10.06]Alright.
[08:12.14]Thank goodness you're here.
[08:13.76]No, not you.
[08:15.32]No, I could care less that you're here.
[08:17.54]Thank goodness that you're here is the name of the game.
[08:22.61]I didn't mean... No, no, no, guys, that's the colon.
[08:25.23]I just read the title of the game.
[08:26.35]I'm so happy that everybody's here.
[08:28.63]You guys don't see, like, the DLC?
[08:31.38]No, what are you... What the fuck?
[08:32.68]Guys, come on.
[08:36.16]Alright, here we go.
[08:38.22]You see, that hurt.
[08:40.04]It hurt me.
[08:42.90]What the fuck?
[08:43.88]Oh, okay.
[08:44.48]Alright, let's go.
[08:54.89]This is like a point and click adventure game.
[09:04.41]I don't know why I just did this.
[09:07.32]That means that I'm unsure of everything I say.
[09:09.36]Big Ron's Big Pies.
[09:11.18]Big Ron's Big Pies.
[09:25.30]Turn it up.
[09:27.26]Alright, turning it up in three, two, one.
[09:30.43]Is that better?
[09:36.59]Family.
[09:37.01]Romance.
[09:37.37]Pit.
[09:37.57]Visit Bowser.
[09:38.01]It's great good.
[09:52.82]What is this game?
[09:54.68]We'll figure it out together.
[09:55.82]That's me.
[09:56.45]That was the, uh, the Las Vegas sphere.
[09:59.49]Okay, that's me.
[10:00.61]Alright, I'm okay.
[10:02.29]Yeah, this game has combat.
[10:29.36]Oh, this game is looking buttery.
[10:32.68]Okay, is it as buttery for you as it is for me?
[10:39.27]Letted water?
[10:41.61]Oh, it did say leaded.
[10:44.93]Okay.
[10:49.13]Can I punch it?
[10:49.79]Yeah, I think I can punch everything.
[10:53.86]Oh, hold on.
[10:58.33]Yeah, it's a wicked buttery game.
[10:59.75]That's how you can tell it's going to be fun.
[11:03.39]Whoa, look at that.
[11:07.93]Oh, smart.
[11:17.31]OK, don't do that.
[11:19.89]Out the window.
[11:26.43]Oi!
[11:26.85]Aggressively British.
[11:29.03]I have no idea what anybody has said.
[11:36.45]I have no idea.
[11:58.88]Okay, is it weird that I want to be one of these guys?
[12:10.75]I want to walk around and look at bananas and walk around with a cane and have a coat on.
[12:17.15]That's the kind of life that I want to live.
[12:23.80]Oh, he's called me a traitor.
[12:31.34]Well, I can do it in America.
[12:32.76]I don't have to be English to do that.
[12:39.32]Why do I have to be British to... to... to... I... that's... I want to walk... I want to walk around at a market and eat bananas.
[12:49.72]But if you just sit there, I'll let you know when he's ready.
[12:51.64]Alright, love.
[12:56.08]Okay.
[13:01.82]Did you... Okay, does everything have... Okay, I have a question for you guys.
[13:05.52]Does everything have one and two state?
[13:08.06]Do you know what I mean by that?
[13:10.18]Like, this is one state.
[13:11.90]That's two state.
[13:12.72]Or are there three state?
[13:15.63]Or four state?
[13:16.35]Is it just one and two state?
[13:19.44]Yes.
[13:20.14]Not everything.
[13:20.72]Okay.
[13:20.84]I just want to make sure.
[13:21.86]Because I don't want to sit here and click, you know, like the Hearthstone board until like fucking Khadgar comes out and yells at me or whatever.
[13:29.20]It takes like 100 clicks.
[13:31.40]Six to nine stages?
[13:34.47]It really depends.
[13:35.47]Some have three.
[13:36.55]Some have three.
[13:38.21]There are 50 states.
[13:39.17]Shut up.
[13:43.83]I'll be in there.
[13:46.35]I have an interview in 25 minutes and I'm going to get in there.
[13:51.49]I haven't done an accent in two months, so... We gotta get the rust off a little here.
[13:59.69]Like guys, when I talk to my mother on the phone, I don't do like a British accent.
[14:03.49]Like, it's been a while.
[14:04.95]You know what I'm saying?
[14:08.45]Okay.
[14:09.57]Trash.
[14:11.82]Why don't you?
[14:14.62]I mean, I'm sure I have at some point.
[14:19.18]You're out of practice with it.
[14:24.89]Alright, yeah, I think everything has a one and a two state.
[14:30.61]Alright, what am I doing?
[14:32.67]Good morning, little fella.
[14:34.83]Nice to have you around.
[14:36.19]Oh, I can't wait for this.
[14:37.35]Ready?
[14:37.55]Alright, here's exactly what's going to happen.
[14:41.08]You ready?
[14:41.96]Watch this.
[14:42.26]Pretend I'm a person here.
[14:44.60]How are you doing there?
[14:46.56]Oh, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
[14:48.78]Always here for the morning.
[14:50.98]Stop that.
[14:52.68]You're annoying.
[14:54.69]You're irritating me.
[14:57.17]I'm not listening.
[14:58.17]Here we go.
[15:11.14]I think I'm just fucking hurting this guy.
[15:14.02]Never mind.
[15:16.24]What happened to you?
[15:26.48]Oh, I'm sorry.
[15:28.35]I can't help it.
[15:32.07]Lubrication.
[15:33.09]Okay, I feel like this feels like I heard Ster do this exact voice before.
[15:47.00]Exact voice.
[15:49.04]It's a little too quiet still, is it really?
[15:50.34]You need to turn it up.
[15:52.87]Ones in chat if you want it turned up.
[16:02.47]I'm seeing a lot of ones, okay.
[16:04.69]We'll do it a little bit more.
[16:05.39]Be careful of your ears.
[16:07.54]I don't want to... I don't want to, like, blow everybody's heads, like, their ears off or whatever.
[16:13.88]Alright, great.
[16:16.66]Alright, I need to find something for you.
[16:19.00]So you're stuck here.
[16:20.14]I gotta find something to... Can I just do water?
[16:22.24]Why don't I just splash water on his arm?
[16:28.36]OK, no jokes from 9 to 17.
[16:31.48]OK.
[16:35.01]Lost cat also lost one child.
[16:38.41]That's not good.
[16:38.89]Alright, what are you doing?
[16:40.27]I probably should ask before punching people.
[16:45.57]Is there a talk button or is it just punch?
[16:49.31]I don't really have any other buttons.
[16:50.39]They think it's just X to punch.
[16:54.61]Punch is talk OK.
[17:01.37]Alright, this is Luigi's Mansion all over again.
[17:03.21]When you give a game... Okay, when a game is given to me like this, I don't even play the game.
[17:07.41]I just... I punch every single object, and that's where I have all the fun.
[17:12.06]I usually don't play these games.
[17:13.24]I usually just walk around and just do all the 1 and 2 and 3 states, and that's it.
[17:17.54]Alright, well... Okay.
[17:19.92]Go down here.
[17:22.76]I probably have to pick up the trash, I'm imagining.
[17:25.39]In Mem Bobby Oddjobs.
[17:28.53]Okay.
[17:28.65]Okay.
[17:37.28]Talk to Bumbum.
[17:41.79]Alright, what are you doing?
[17:45.61]Can I steal?
[17:48.11]No.
[17:48.81]I'm doing good.
[17:51.29]Alright, you want a puzzle.
[17:52.77]You need lubricant.

[18:37.37]Everyone thinks short people can't do that.
[18:39.60]You've never seen us do that before.
[18:40.62]We do it very seldomly.
[18:43.54]All you tall people.
[18:44.54]Yeah.
[18:46.18]What the fuck can you do?
[18:47.78]You don't gotta triple jump.

[19:47.72]Oh my God.
[19:50.20]Don't do that.
[19:50.90]I love you.
[19:56.22]I love you.
[19:58.96]thought about it.
[20:00.16]Wait, does that mean it's premeditated now?
[20:02.88]Oh, fuck.
[20:03.28]Hold on a second.
[20:03.96]This means it's premeditated.
[20:06.36]If I had just ran... If I had just ran them over, it wouldn't have been premeditated.
[20:10.77]Uh-oh.
[20:12.01]Did I do it again?
[20:17.33]Well, that's kind of sad.
[20:31.86]That's sad.
[20:32.48]Do I get anything for that?
[20:38.44]Are you getting money?
[20:43.91]I broke the lawnmower.
[20:48.29]I don't like this game anymore, somebody said.
[20:52.01]Just wait till we find the butter, okay?
[21:00.50]I know that because...
[21:02.41]I watched a couple people play the first period of this game.
[21:05.45]I know it's here.
[21:06.03]I tuned in, I saw butter and I was like, I got to play it.
[21:10.25]Yeah, there it is.
[21:13.95]I saw this part right here.
[21:17.11]And I said, wow, that looks like fun.
[21:18.53]I'm going to play it.
[21:19.48]I must have pre-played it.
[21:21.92]I pre-played the whole game to make sure that I can get every puzzle fucking precisely.
[21:29.54]I don't, yeah, you probably used it right there.
[21:31.40]That's the only thing I know.
[21:34.63]I really don't want to say that out loud because then people will think that that's real.
[21:38.77]And then how, after you like pre-played the whole game, how could you possibly mess up the like pipe puzzle probably that happens in an hour?
[21:46.31]Okay, so.
[21:52.13]You didn't even talk to the gardener?
[21:53.25]Wait, what?
[21:55.95]That wasn't the gardener?
[21:57.87]Oh, that wasn't the gardener.
[22:02.40]That was just somebody kind of standing there.
[22:03.94]There's the gardener.
[22:05.84]You probably thought I'd butter play this.
[22:11.99]You're pretending.
[22:14.95]All I know is there's butter in the game.
[22:16.39]That's all I know.
[22:17.95]Okay.
[22:19.87]So he said, thank you.
[22:22.63]That didn't really do anything though.
[22:36.10]Cool.
[22:40.26]Did you want me to do that?
[22:41.20]Alright.
[22:49.65]So how do I?
[22:50.27]Where do I go?
[22:54.53]All I know is that butter is probably used here.
[22:59.83]Oh, can I get in there?
[23:04.29]Talk to the butter people.
[23:06.62]Is there a sprint?
[23:07.20]Come on, there's not like a go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:12.64]I'm sorry, sir.
[23:13.90]My clothes this morning.
[23:16.62]Because this goat has lost my keys.
[23:19.82]And now we've got to wait for that useless locksmith.
[23:23.24]I'm sorry, Mrs. Meg.
[23:24.86]What am I like?
[23:26.20]Colin, you are the most work-shy fuck I've ever had the misfortune to employ.
[23:37.36]Yeah, why can't I... I'm actually pretty upset.
[23:40.46]Why can I not hold B?
[23:42.32]Like, I start holding B right now, and a little green rectangle appears over my character's head.
[23:48.00]And it starts to deplete, and I go ten times faster.
[23:51.15]Like, that's annoying.
[24:07.37]A lot of bugs everywhere.
[24:09.35]They're all over the place.
[24:11.49]Wait, what did he say?
[24:12.07]Did he say go away?
[24:18.98]Why is that your first instinct?
[24:20.10]I don't know, because there's usually somebody on the other end of this that can yell out like fucking commands and stuff.
[24:27.87]We can talk.
[24:32.11]I'm going to put my mouth on it and start like, hey, this is home base.
[24:37.15]The water is going to come down and fill my fucking lungs.
[24:48.06]What do you need help with?
[24:53.65]Hit the garage.
[25:02.70]Oh, it worked.
[25:07.56]I missed the joke.
[25:08.58]I missed... This was the funny... This was the reveal that it was... Okay, well, sorry I missed the joke.
[25:13.60]Okay.
[25:21.42]Where have I not been?
[25:22.42]This guy needs a hospital.
[25:28.17]He needs... Uh-oh.
[25:35.91]Why don't I just pull?
[25:38.94]Please stop punching people.
[25:42.58]I don't think I'm going to stop doing that.
[25:46.74]Can I get those?
[26:05.80]Is he a drunk driver?
[26:09.48]Holy shit.
[26:13.60]I know I have to touch everything.
[26:15.38]I told you guys this is going to be a huge problem.
[26:22.36]I am way smaller than I thought I was.
[26:24.39]Are they huge?
[26:25.81]Why did I get so small?
[26:33.97]I wanna punch him right in the nose.
[26:35.79]Okay.
[27:02.50]He's got keys.
[27:03.14]He's got keys.
[27:09.29]Nice.
[27:09.67]That guy's pissed.
[27:19.25]Oh, okay.
[27:23.03]British Spongebob?
[27:24.28]I like the blue.
[27:39.29]Is there anything to this or?
[27:40.75]This is a puzzle.
[27:54.68]No, OK.
[27:55.10]I was very calm for what just happened.
[28:08.25]Oh, I'm moving around.
[28:09.11]Hold on, let me take a sip.
[28:15.20]It sounded like the sound that comes out of the toilet bowl when you have diarrhea.
[28:37.90]As I was saying that, I realized how absolutely fucking vile that was and whatever.
[28:44.56]I don't care.
[28:45.12]Holy crap.
[28:45.50]Whoa.
[29:12.68]Do I pop all the bubbles?
[29:13.68]You're back in the retirement cave.
[29:32.16]Oh shit, what happened?
[29:33.14]Why did he go away?
[29:33.78]Oh Meg.
[29:34.08]I didn't even do anything.
[29:35.42]Pay attention.
[29:35.88]I am.
[29:36.58]Pay attention.
[29:38.58]I've been in three different scenes in ten minutes.
[29:58.57]You're supposed to pay attention so then you can tell me what to do when I don't pay attention and I make all of you embarrassed to even be here in the first place.
[30:05.35]How could we watch the streamer fail because you need to be here?
[30:09.33]Otherwise, I'll never get through the game.
[30:10.49]So what do I get for that?
[30:15.75]Do I get anything?
[30:17.87]I'm not going to break these.
[30:21.79]Well, I didn't.
[30:23.97]Whatever.
[30:24.89]Wait.
[30:25.87]Should I?
[30:26.31]No.
[30:27.86]Wait, what did I even get for that?
[30:31.77]I didn't get anything.
[30:32.59]That guy had a pan- he had keys in his hand.
[30:34.21]Alright, I'm breaking shit now.
[30:47.08]Go back to the- oh boy.
[30:48.22]It's no use.
[31:03.93]Here's a little bit of behind the scenes.
[31:07.17]Sometimes I'll say like a joke that I was like, oh, hey, I got one coming out here.
[31:12.54]And I'll be able to hear Holly laugh.
[31:15.72]I'll sometimes be able to hear it like, oh, that one must have landed because like it doesn't happen every single time.
[31:20.40]But when it does, it does.
[31:22.52]That last one with the whole like toilet bowl one.
[31:25.44]Silence.
[31:26.10]I didn't hear anything.
[31:27.29]Zero.
[31:27.91]Absolute dead silence.
[31:29.43]So that one did not land.
[31:30.69]That one did not land at all.
[31:36.35]But you know what?
[31:36.81]It like landed for me.
[31:38.19]And I'm like, I guess I'm the fucking weird guy.
[31:44.71]Oh, look, is it open?
[31:46.33]It is open.
[31:49.18]What happened?
[31:55.71]I know there's butter.
[31:59.27]What?
[31:59.73]Okay.
[32:00.09]Can I do anything else here?
[32:01.85]Are you drunk?
[32:02.47]It is 12 o'clock in the afternoon.
[32:03.63]No, I am not drunk.
[32:05.14]I'm not drinking.
[32:05.92]I'm drinking.
[32:27.66]I love how you turn into small non-mushroom Mario sometimes.
[32:38.09]I love it.
[32:41.77]Did you have your morning pint?
[32:44.17]Ah, no I didn't.
[32:44.83]Is this the freezer?
[32:48.21]Okay, wait.
[32:49.31]What am I doing?
[32:50.15]Is this where I just came from?
[32:51.87]Oh boy, okay.
[32:53.01]Milk next to flour, never sours.
[32:57.80]37 degrees Celsius.
[33:00.42]I don't know what that is.
[33:01.94]I'm from like the three countries on Earth that don't know what that says.
[33:04.82]I don't know what that is.
[33:07.14]Is that cold?
[33:15.17]It's not.
[33:15.55]Alright, what is it?
[33:19.45]Milk next to flour never sours.
[33:21.57]So milk next to flour is already here.
[33:26.89]Oops.
[33:28.58]milk near an egg also fine oh you found me I'm the fridge stout and I'm awfully frigid ah no I just I'm actually the town vole if you catch my meaning defense Carol sucks peas
[33:59.72]Barmy berries, extra large, buttery nubs.
[34:09.87]Oh dear.
[34:18.36]Let's go.
[34:18.86]I did it.
[34:28.57]Ooh, hello.
[34:36.57]Oh, by the tulips in the window.
[34:41.72]Rightio, chaps.
[34:43.08]Ready for one last tug-a-tug-a-roo?
[34:46.82]Grab a hold of my forum.
[34:49.30]On my mark.
[34:51.83]Three, two, one.
[34:55.67]Eee!
[35:02.35]Eating it?
[35:02.69]I laughed.
[35:03.38]I laughed.
[35:05.50]I laughed.
[35:47.68]Okay, cool.
[35:48.40]Let's go.
[35:50.90]Funny sign.
[35:57.35]Okay, I'm imagining I can go down there now.
[36:00.13]I've never seen a hole as big as that before.
[36:04.91]But what else is there to do up here?
[36:08.55]Did the pub?
[36:10.69]I did the garden.
[36:12.20]Did I do that?
[36:12.64]I don't think I went down here today.
[36:15.56]I did not.
[36:15.98]OK, what is this?
[36:23.36]I do love my mole wife.
[36:25.54]You and your wife should come around sometime.
[36:27.96]We live underground, in soil and that.
[36:30.22]I think that's where I'm about to go.
[36:31.56]I've got some worms to suck up into my big mole mouth.
[36:33.83]I imagine that's exactly where this is going to take us.
[36:44.52]Anything in the paper?
[36:53.72]Stop.
[36:56.12]This is a game about punching people.
[36:59.38]Crime three since 93.
[37:01.82]Please see it, smell it, sort it.
[37:04.55]Do not ask me about 92.
[37:06.23]Okay.
[37:07.51]Alright, I'm going in.
[37:17.07]Right into the butter.
[37:28.20]Oh shit.
[37:29.02]Do I have to be careful?
[37:33.68]Ah, I think I had to be careful.
[37:39.69]Wait, what?
[37:52.77]Is this how snakes and cockroaches and stuff climb out of the toilet?
[37:58.65]I don't think this thing's worked in quite a while.
[38:01.74]How have you been cooking fish and chips all this time?
[38:04.64]Oh, I just do a cold fry, usually.
[38:08.40]Okay.
[38:35.10]Scotland, yeah.
[38:35.70]Kids deal.
[38:36.28]Just eat some of your mom's.
[38:37.77]True.
[38:38.43]Yep.
[38:38.65]That's right.
[39:01.46]Fish and chips.
[39:02.80]Ten Bob.
[39:03.24]Fish or chips.
[39:03.90]Ten Bob.
[39:04.44]Can of pop.
[39:05.60]Ten Bob.
[39:06.39]Wait, that's no.
[39:06.89]That's a one.
[39:08.43]Oh.
[39:09.83]Bob.
[39:12.09]Caution.
[39:12.51]Wet chips.
[39:13.13]Health and safety rating.
[39:14.13]Piss poor.
[39:20.35]Okay.
[39:21.99]Anything else?
[39:22.51]No.
[39:23.10]I don't think so.
[39:23.62]Okay.
[39:25.94]You missed the joke.
[39:27.14]What joke?
[39:27.52]What?
[39:29.60]Did I miss a joke?
[39:34.36]Am I missing English humor?
[39:36.68]I'm American though.
[39:38.93]Did I miss British humor?
[39:41.67]Or you just didn't get it?
[39:43.15]I was looking at the sign.
[39:47.45]Oh, it's Scottish humor.
[39:48.41]Sorry.
[39:48.81]Yep.
[39:50.78]Americans don't... They made... I was looking at the sign.
[39:58.24]There's a lot of really cool visual stuff here.
[40:03.94]Alright, I promise I will not miss the next joke.
[40:07.88]I will hear it.
[40:14.50]Only the UK has sex jokes.
[40:16.50]Is that what it was?
[40:17.10]Oh, hold on.
[40:29.31]Yeah, pips.
[40:31.03]Alright.
[40:33.73]This car looks like it's inflated.
[40:35.59]It's past driving school.
[41:07.32]I like this sign.
[41:09.08]Like the smiley face.
[41:20.36]Messing up the mail, OK.
[41:26.11]Any more rats?
[41:31.05]Chippy the farm and bum burly clothes close.
[41:36.93]I'm looking for teats.
[41:41.15]What?
[41:42.18]For off-inches.
[41:42.78]I'm not pushing.
[41:44.50]Oh, okay.
[41:45.44]Okay, okay, okay.
[41:46.70]Oh.
[41:47.22]Oh.
[41:47.98]Oh.
[41:48.38]What?
[41:49.50]Fuck.
[41:51.78]High on price, low on quality.
[41:58.91]Oh, knock on my door, is it?
[42:00.09]Yeah.
[42:10.89]Yeah, you're not ready for anything when you're in the bath, huh?
[42:13.89]That's like the absolute worst place to be.
[42:15.35]There's no... If you are in the bathtub, you are completely useless.
[42:21.97]Even if you need to get out like really quickly.
[42:23.62]Let's just say like I need to get out of the tub and there's an emergency I have to do.
[42:28.36]It's going to take at least one full minute for you to get out of that bath and go wherever you need to go.
[42:39.81]Speak for yourself.
[42:43.44]Wait.
[42:43.58]What are you looking at?
[42:48.65]Birds.
[42:49.39]Are you looking over here?
[42:50.71]Men underfoot.
[43:02.13]Lay here.
[43:03.21]Porky knobbers.
[43:04.63]Extra large.
[43:10.76]From bird to bottle, ten Bob.
[43:12.42]We are no longer accepting weird Scottish notes.
[43:16.92]That wet crunch.
[43:20.73]I sure can.
[43:21.35]That's right.
[43:21.95]I can do anything you need me to do.
[43:24.17]I am here as an American tourist.
[43:26.03]I can do anything you need.

[44:21.25]Oh, I don't know.
[44:21.91]I better call mother.
[44:25.21]Do you also have go-kart racing here like we do in America?
[44:27.98]Do you like ketchup like we do in the United States of America?
[44:53.85]I hope Holly laughed at that one.
[44:55.31]You need some positive feedback.
[44:59.19]I think this is just what I'm.
[45:01.42]Oh, that's what I was supposed to do.
[45:02.36]Okay.
[45:16.89]Could you please point me to the aisle with the crisps?
[45:20.05]I know in the United States of America we call them chips.
[45:23.33]But not over here.
[45:24.70]And I'm a tourist that did their research.
[45:36.37]Did I get anything for that?
[45:41.45]Or was it just a fun thing to do?
[45:42.55]I think it was just a fun thing to do.
[45:45.97]Wait, I can go that way.
[45:49.11]Can I?
[45:51.65]I can't go that way.
[45:57.27]Why are you min maxing?
[46:00.39]Wait, am I min maxing?
[46:07.40]Hit the register.
[46:08.20]I think I did what I can do there.
[46:16.33]You missed the joke again.
[46:17.43]There was no joke.
[46:20.67]Council says we've got to get these dogs buried by end of day.
[46:24.80]That's just what we call laying pipes, which is what we call shagging.
[46:32.24]In the United States of America, we call that fucking, I think.
[46:37.51]Could be something else.
[46:39.73]Some people say that too.
[46:48.64]My bum-burly clothes?
[46:51.61]Big Ron's Big Pies and Sons.
[46:53.71]I love it.
[46:54.55]Yep.
[46:57.33]Yes, yes, yes.
[46:59.92]Something special in between.
[47:01.16]Okay.
[47:04.86]Barnsworth police are aware of illegal activities taking place in this area.
[47:13.64]What could happen to you?
[47:14.30]Uh oh.
[47:14.82]Can I pick these up?
[47:16.44]Looking for a good time.
[47:17.18]1am, 3pm.
[47:45.96]Release the sausages.
[47:49.50]This is a Bobby Bash area.
[47:58.70]I'm surprised 1AM is still on there.
[48:00.65]Let's be honest, right?
[48:20.35]What are you doing?
[48:20.85]Oh, no, no.
[48:22.93]I want to talk.
[48:23.32]What have we got here then?
[48:24.46]A towel and the owl.
[48:26.42]Don't worry, little fella.
[48:27.98]I'll pop you down the apples and pears in a jiffy.
[48:30.48]Still at large.
[48:38.56]Crime is skyrocketing.
[48:45.21]Ah, a fine mess.
[48:48.45]Don't bother there, young man.
[48:50.15]Help yourself to some scrambled bread on your way out.
[48:54.37]Should I tell that story?
[48:55.41]Should we pull it back and reference an old thing that happened?
[48:59.40]Maybe some people that weren't here?
[49:01.26]I'll tell it real quick.
[49:03.24]One time, Holly and I were on the couch, and we were high.
[49:06.76]We had smoked some weed.
[49:09.58]And we started to get a little, like, okay.
[49:12.48]We were watching TV.
[49:13.62]We were just kind of hanging out.
[49:14.40]And it was like, wee!
[49:16.01]We're getting a little too, a little, a little too high here.
[49:18.63]We need to, we need to pull this back, right?
[49:21.29]We need to, a palate cleanser because it was like getting a little, like I need to, we need to relax and just kind of watch something without a problem.
[49:28.36]So we went to a video.
[49:29.82]It was called, I believe it was called like stress-free cats to brighten up your day.
[49:34.00]It was just a cat's video.
[49:36.52]And I didn't have like an ad blocker or anything and an ad started playing and it played wicked fucking loud like they all do.
[49:43.86]And it just started screaming at us.
[49:46.95]Crime is skyrocketing in Nevada.
[49:51.01]You are not safe in this car.
[49:53.09]And it was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[49:55.09]What are you talking about?
[49:55.73]We're not safe.
[49:56.53]Crime is skyrocketing, honey.
[49:59.17]Honey, did you see what's happening on TV right now?
[50:00.89]We were just looking for a stress-free video.
[50:06.91]I know I've told that story before, but we speed ran it this time.
[50:10.19]Tell the Oreo puke story.
[50:18.92]No!
[50:19.06]No!
[50:35.29]You can't, okay, there is a finite amount of time that you can tell a story before it's not a story anymore.
[50:42.17]It's like a routine.
[50:43.69]I gotta pee wicked bad.
[50:53.70]I'll be right back.
[50:55.32]I drank a whole Gatorade.
[50:56.42]I need fluids.
[50:59.18]That just jump scared me.
[51:00.10]I was like, what am I looking at here?
[51:01.08]I'll be right back.
[51:02.34]See you guys in like two or three minutes.
[54:14.25]I am back.
[54:16.66]Also, you might hear Otto.
[54:19.24]We'll do a little bit of sniffling, maybe a sneeze.
[54:23.26]He is right here.
[54:25.08]I got him.
[54:26.14]Just kind of keeping an eye on him.
[54:29.48]He's doing good, though.
[54:33.77]We're much happier with kind of how he's bounced off the bottom.
[54:37.53]Because, yeah, I told you before, there was a point where it was like, damn, this is
[54:44.70]This is not looking great, but he's doing okay.
[54:48.71]He's doing good.
[54:53.45]But if you hear that, you may hear it every so often.
[55:04.07]Yeah, you doing good?
[55:05.63]He's like, yes, I am.
[55:08.09]And he was running around earlier.
[55:09.09]He actually had some energy, so that was really encouraging.
[55:11.61]So he's doing good.
[55:15.97]Alright, back to it.
[55:16.85]Alright, what do I need to do?
[55:20.95]I might have been thrown out yet.
[55:46.10]Thank goodness you're here.
[55:47.55]I've been sucking this pipe all morning.
[55:49.47]I haven't got a drop out of it.
[55:51.39]Little tomato here has already crusted over.
[55:54.05]We need to dampen that topsoil pronto.
[56:03.68]Don't do that.
[56:06.56]She needs a drink lad.
[56:07.60]She's drier than Meg's fruitcake.
[56:17.24]No?
[56:17.58]Wait.
[56:18.14]What's this?
[56:20.06]Huh?
[56:23.80]Is this the well?
[56:24.54]Oops.
[56:43.66]Trying to punch people so bad that I jump down into the well.
[56:47.23]Oops-a-daisy.
[56:50.61]Okay, obviously we have to follow this.
[56:58.84]Obviously.
[56:59.50]Blue Jerry wall?
[57:06.82]More than one?
[57:07.34]Oh no.
[57:15.58]Oh no.
[57:17.32]Tunneling for the desperate gardener.
[57:28.25]He missed the worm.
[57:29.11]I saw the worm.
[57:31.51]The worm is not a joke to miss.
[57:32.93]The worm is like a cool thing that was put there.
[57:35.94]Warning, liminal spaces may be less engaging than they appear.
[57:45.44]See?
[57:45.92]I laughed at it.
[57:46.84]I heard it.
[57:47.55]I saw it.
[57:51.31]The worm says jokes.
[57:53.32]The worm talks?
[57:56.22]No.
[58:16.31]You just made that up.
[58:19.01]Yeah, you made that up.
[58:19.99]That was just completely made up.
[58:23.67]Okay, I'm done entertaining this.
[58:34.26]I heard it.
[58:34.90]Somebody said, explain this joke if you get it.
[58:45.04]I don't have to prove to anybody.
[58:48.60]I thought it was funny because the corner was peeling.
[58:51.34]And it says Arning.
[58:54.47]You can derive humor from many different avenues.
[58:56.53]If I had a fish in a bottle.
[59:06.94]If I had a cat in a box.
[59:09.50]If I had a crab in a torture.
[59:18.34]Electricity.
[59:20.88]Oh, it's on OK.
[59:27.68]Why would this do that?
[59:33.32]You say anything you don't say anything.
[59:39.82]Nothing.
[59:45.55]OK, well I guess I just go back and I go over here.
[60:00.73]They're all looking at me.
[60:03.89]I have to be able to do something here.
[60:12.89]Cigarettes on the cutting board.
[60:14.23]Oh my God.
[60:29.44]How do I get back down there?
[60:37.73]Can't jump back up here.
[60:44.19]Can't jump over.
[60:44.89]I tried to jump over that.
[60:45.99]I tried.
[60:46.53]I tried like three times.
[60:47.89]OK.
[60:48.05]There's choice.
[61:06.72]I think it's extra tar.
[61:08.72]Big smoke.
[61:10.21]Wow.
[61:10.73]Are these... Are these cigarettes?
[61:16.07]Oh.
[61:22.39]And they're only ten Bob each.
[61:28.99]Oh, a fine scene.
[61:31.45]Jasper, I've no idea how I got there.
[61:35.38]I pull the other one.
[61:36.84]Passing off my spanner as a stiff kipper, is it?
[61:39.68]But we've been friends for forty years.
[61:42.89]Why on Earth would I betray your trust now?
[61:46.25]Why don't you spare me the excuses, you fat trout?
[61:49.75]I'm taking this back to my toolbox, where it belongs.
[61:53.82]How embarrassing.
[61:58.60]Big smoke.
[61:59.46]You're lacking work, lad.
[62:00.72]Your skills never look better.
[62:08.04]Are there cigarettes in the food in England?
[62:10.14]Are there cigarettes in the food?
[62:11.56]That's what this is implying.
[62:17.53]It's like, okay, I'm an American, right?
[62:20.07]Like cheeseburgers.
[62:21.93]Oh, like McDonald's cheeseburger fucking American, right?
[62:25.53]Are there cigarette butts in the food in England?
[62:28.23]Is this like part of the joke?
[62:34.57]Yes.
[62:37.82]Oh shit.
[62:42.40]They come with the food, not inside it.
[62:51.55]Fish for fish, fish for cigs.
[62:55.53]Have you heard about Big Ron's?
[62:56.83]What's he done?

[63:23.29]You say something, then I do.
[63:24.27]And then you say something, then I say something, then you say something.
[63:27.66]I don't know.
[63:27.94]It doesn't matter what they're saying.

[81:17.94]And I clicked the X, I think, on the OBS.
[81:20.88]And that is my fault.
[81:22.24]I'm very much apologizing right now for it.
[81:25.30]I just closed OBS.

[82:32.19]Well, that won't happen again.
[82:34.23]We're good.
[82:34.65]Alright.
[82:35.45]What was I just doing?
[82:36.14]Oh, yeah.

[82:39.46]Ready?
[82:42.04]Oh.
[82:54.33]I can't believe it.

[85:20.19]Let's give it to him.
[85:21.67]I thought it was kind of shitty and lame, but... Don't say it.
[85:25.19]Don't bring it up or anything.
[85:26.05]I want ice cream.
[85:42.85]Alright, there's two doors.

[96:35.14]They're not all supposed to be funny.
[96:37.84]What's the matter, Otto?

[103:26.33]Did you fall in?
[103:29.45]Oi, you fall in?
[103:32.11]How many people said that?
[103:44.70]Nobody?
[103:47.52]Okay.
[103:49.58]Alright, let's continue.
[103:53.74]Can you hear it?
[103:56.41]I don't want to be without audio again.
[103:58.06]Okay.
[104:03.32]So I had to get the rat poison.
[104:05.16]Are they eating it?
[104:05.72]I hope not.
[104:08.88]It's a good quality bin.
[104:13.68]Can I have the screwdriver?
[104:14.58]I can't see.
[104:22.05]Okay, there you go.
[104:31.31]So now what?
[104:36.17]New from Jay and Mel.
[104:38.07]Double ended mops.
[104:42.51]That's kind of a... Is that a bad idea?
[104:45.35]It seems like kind of a good idea.
[104:48.62]Notice employees must wash their teeth.
[104:57.58]Darth Vader style?
[104:59.22]Darth Maul.
[105:00.16]Darth Maul, actually.
[105:03.55]Darth Vader.
[105:04.37]Oh yeah, remember when Darth Vader, like, had the double-bladed saber?
[105:10.44]And did the... When I do that, everybody knows what that is.
[105:16.56]Everybody knows what that is.
[105:21.59]That is above the head.
[105:23.07]Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin with one hand.
[105:24.95]And then it comes down into two.
[105:30.05]That's the image that just projected.
[105:32.13]What a crazy world we live in.
[105:34.09]Think about that.
[105:34.91]I just telepathically ported an image into your head with telepathy.
[105:44.33]The world is magical.
[105:52.64]Oh no, another alien rant.
[105:55.64]No, this is a the world is magical rant.
[105:59.62]And it's not a rant, it's just a fact.
[106:06.05]Did I do everything I'm supposed to do here?
[106:07.35]I did what you wanted me to do.
[106:08.73]Where's the screwdriver?
[106:09.53]Oh, I'm supposed to do.
[106:19.58]I'm supposed to actually go up there and do the Mario joke.
[106:30.90]Oh my god, you actually do this.
[106:36.36]I like joked myself off, effectively.
[106:40.62]I like joked myself away from it.
[106:49.77]How do you... Tony's?
[106:54.81]Hiya.
[106:55.89]Yeah, this is Bumbley World branch.
[106:58.25]We got a bit of a rap problem.
[107:01.28]Are you sure you can do that on stream?
[107:06.73]Well they could be, but they're a bit small and gray.
[107:13.36]Oh yes, I imagine noise matters.
[107:19.83]Yeah, I joked off.
[107:21.67]I made a stupid jokey reference to something.
[107:25.23]So in my brain, that was a joke.
[107:27.56]So I put myself off from even trying to do it in the first place.
[107:31.86]Do you guys have ears?
[107:33.84]Open them.
[107:43.26]leave no bin bag unchewed borrow from biggies remember biggies are not people what I want to get over there wait I want to open this door no I don't I want to where do I want to go this looks kind of cool I'm going in here first

[108:10.83]Stop the stigma.
[108:11.99]Shit wherever.
[108:21.12]Okay.
[108:24.00]What is this?
[108:26.26]I kind of don't want to break anything in here.
[108:29.83]Oh, it's cheese.
[108:44.91]I'm trying to hear the lyrics.
[108:57.30]Oh!
[108:57.60]My cheese!
[108:58.40]Gromit!
[109:00.10]The cheese Gromit!
[109:07.18]Oh no!
[109:11.39]A cracking toast grommet.
[109:15.41]When I was a little kid, I didn't know what cracking meant.
[109:19.09]I thought cracking just meant the toast was really toasted.
[109:21.80]It almost burnt.
[109:23.48]And I was like, holy shit, cracking toast, like crunchy toast.
[109:27.40]Like that sounds fucking incredible.
[109:29.82]I didn't say, I didn't say that.
[109:31.16]I didn't say fucking incredible because I was like nine, ten or something.
[109:35.44]But I said, that's so awesome.
[109:36.92]And whatever, you know, dialect or whatever I was going to say it in
[109:47.21]These are fat rats.
[109:51.83]Uh-oh.
[109:55.98]Wait, I'm getting thrown out.
[109:57.52]I'm getting kicked out.
[109:58.70]I think I just got kicked out.
[110:05.28]Alright, take everything.
[110:08.31]That's a screwdriver right here.
[110:14.05]Oh shit, that was fucking diabolical.
[110:22.02]Carrie Louise, pickle.
[110:23.98]Passing off my flathead as your produce, is it?
[110:27.31]Jasper, why on Earth would I do that?
[110:30.55]I cannae turn my back for a minute in this town without one of yous pinching my tools.
[110:35.65]I swear down, I've never seen this before in my life.
[110:39.26]Really cool.
[110:39.76]Okay.
[110:40.22]Can I go back there?
[111:10.95]What can I do now?
[111:11.35]Why'd you do that?
[111:27.87]Imagine like you, you like went outside or whatever.
[111:30.99]And like your, like your neighbor's trash barrel was in your trash barrel.
[111:38.76]It'd be like, what is, what do I even do about this?
[111:44.84]Do you, what do you, what would you do?
[111:50.83]I'm sorry, sorry.
[111:51.77]I'm sorry, but I'm an American tourist.
[111:54.74]I said trash barrel.
[111:56.44]I didn't say bin.
[111:59.38]Sorry about that, American tourist coming through.
[112:13.82]Garbage can.
[112:16.78]Trash barrel.
[112:18.80]What?
[112:19.34]I say trash barrel.
[112:20.52]You guys don't say who... What?
[112:25.74]Garbage can, trash barrel, trash bin.
[112:28.34]These are all correct.
[112:29.44]Trash barrel.
[112:31.79]Who the fuck says barrel?
[112:33.47]Trash barrel.
[112:36.99]Are you kidding me?
[112:37.65]Are you kidding me?
[112:40.21]Why are you medieval peasant?
[112:43.58]That's a trash barrel.
[112:45.98]Put it in the barrel.
[112:54.94]Hi, thanks for helping me get the screwdriver back, laddie.
[112:59.62]I wish I could say we were done, lad, I really do.
[113:02.08]But as I got back, I noticed my hammer's gone, walkies.
[113:05.71]Do you live on a wooden ship?
[113:06.89]I must have been hit by that no-good yob, Frank.
[113:09.07]He's probably doing it at the brook, poaching fish as we speak.
[113:12.37]Okay, fisherman.
[113:16.12]Hurry doing along to the brook before Frank does himself a mischief with my hammer.
[113:22.39]Quick time, lad, come on.
[113:23.75]If I don't get this fryer fixed soon, March is going to have my pants down.
[113:27.63]I was chatting, never heard of trash barrel.
[113:29.63]Yeah, I don't know.
[113:30.64]Her and her sister were so lucky when I used to babysit them.
[113:34.32]Very powerful, those pickle sisters.
[113:38.28]Okay, so we need to go back to where that stream was.
[113:45.55]You age your trash in a barrel like wine.
[113:47.97]Don't put me in your bin.
[113:52.98]That's a pretty sick Super Mario outfit.
[114:00.97]I'm so glad he looked right at the camera.
[114:09.72]Quickened head, blackened lung, smoking's best when you start it young.
[114:16.02]I used to go to Bishop's, but my doctor says the brine will give me gout.
[114:23.00]Alright.
[114:25.98]Alright, I gotta go back to where the fishing was happening.
[114:31.38]No parking, no loitering, no dogging.
[114:33.69]Nothing special, right?
[114:45.15]Pie.
[114:51.87]frame perfect frame perfect frame perfect frame perfect oh my god no he's not gonna do it frame perfect no he's not here he is again ready for another bit of fiddle sticks are you watch your knees oh no this poor guy
[115:18.54]Ah, hello again.
[115:20.30]Didn't expect to see you twice in one day.
[115:24.94]Sorry about that.
[115:45.34]Gone to rogs.
[116:06.52]Is there a reason why everybody is peeing their pants?
[116:10.70]It's just piss on at least four or five characters so far.
[116:17.56]This is pee stains on everybody.
[116:22.76]That's not a British thing.
[116:31.14]It's a British pastime.
[116:32.34]What?
[116:32.70]Alright, snails.
[116:59.68]I don't see any snails.
[117:09.87]Snail?
[117:11.33]This is locked.
[117:13.37]No snail zone.
[117:17.43]Sue loves a snail.
[117:22.29]Okay.
[117:27.85]I'm only doing this to look for snails.
[117:29.47]I don't want to destroy everything, but I have to.
[117:31.91]What's going on here?
[117:53.63]Somebody's gotta get the spoon away from this dude.
[118:04.85]Oh my God, they killed him.
[118:07.03]I think they killed him.
[118:08.07]They killed this guy.
[118:08.73]Is there any police?
[118:11.69]They just fucking, oh my God.
[118:14.22]Is he alive?
[118:14.88]I think he's alive.
[118:25.00]Wanted for crime.
[118:25.88]Yeah.
[118:27.50]Right here.
[118:27.96]Just blasted the guy in the head.
[118:36.70]Murderous children.
[118:46.66]That was so abrupt, too.
[118:47.84]He just stopped talking.
[118:49.16]That was...
[118:58.04]Fill in the well.
[118:58.54]Yeah, I'm just checking around.
[118:59.56]See if I missed anything.
[119:00.32]I think we're good.
[119:13.89]There's blood on your hands.
[119:19.08]Okay, so you're saying that because I punched that dude.
[119:23.44]And that dude said, hey, somebody just punched me.
[119:27.02]Somebody just punched me in the back of my shoulder.
[119:30.20]I'm going to hit this guy lying on the ground in the head with a giant spoon.
[119:37.54]I'm not so sure about that.
[119:40.78]I could imagine if he turned around and was like, hey, like, oi, and put it up like, I'm going to fucking bash you with this thing.
[119:52.83]You escalated the situation.
[119:54.39]Hello, I'm a worm.
[119:57.46]Another thing you ought to know about worms.
[119:59.24]Very limited career paths.
[120:01.12]It's either down the compost heap or off crawling through keyholes at night to find a shiny penny.
[120:05.94]How's that for dirty work?
[120:09.74]It's real.
[120:11.14]You were not lying.
[120:12.66]Oh, we can actually punch the worm.
[120:16.48]The joke worm, yeah.
[120:20.66]That's third degree murder.
[120:29.42]Okay.
[120:31.02]No.
[120:31.64]If I punch that guy, and then that guy goes on to be in a rage and fights that guy.
[120:38.03]No.
[120:39.77]Wait, I don't think so.
[120:41.79]No, I don't think that's how it works.
[120:56.36]What's a liminal space?
[120:57.34]What's a liminal space?
[120:58.26]I don't know.
[121:00.92]Like a small area.
[121:03.32]A minimal area.
[121:05.82]A small space.
[121:07.96]A minimal, a liminal space.
[121:09.76]It's a small spot.
[121:18.98]He's so stupid.
[121:19.70]Hey, I don't give a rat's behind, okay?
[121:21.62]The crab here, though.
[121:57.66]Oh, the crab's got a cigar.
[121:58.98]Anything else?
[122:18.49]Is this how you keep your cigarettes?
[122:19.77]Apparently, he's going to Sam's for his rum.
[122:22.03]Never.
[122:22.87]They are luscious, though.
[122:24.39]Nah.
[122:24.71]Well, ah, they are luscious.
[122:25.67]Not screaming there.
[122:26.86]But another man's meat in your pie.
[122:28.50]What are we, Sheffield?
[122:32.38]Not after the last time.
[122:34.20]Should hang his head.
[122:36.22]Oh.
[122:36.78]Yeah.
[122:39.49]Dude, it's so funny seeing this guy.
[122:43.21]He doesn't understand British references and British humor and stuff.
[122:47.37]And I love when he just doesn't get it, and I do, because I'm from Britain.
[122:57.42]Well, well, I never thought I'd see the day where the big man would come to me for his meat.
[123:03.64]Come up here and I'll do all this for you.
[123:16.01]I got it.
[123:22.79]This is where the real game starts.
[123:24.07]Turkey.
[123:38.84]I turned I got turned into a meat Lois.
[123:48.06]Look, Lois.
[123:50.12]Turned into... Vinny did a better impression here.
[124:04.57]Hold on a sec.
[124:08.47]Fuck, hold on.
[124:10.61]Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[124:20.05]Hey, Lois!
[124:23.95]Can you imagine?
[124:24.59]I got turned into a pile of meat at the meat factory.
[124:31.85]Kind of reminds me of the time that I turned into... Good?
[124:39.14]Was that better than before?
[124:40.20]You make me sick, somebody said.
[124:42.26]So sick, to a point.
[124:43.82]Well, you just got yourself a five-minute timeout.
[124:47.26]Courtesy of the chef.
[124:48.42]Thank you and there it is.
[124:58.85]I'm leaving, I'm leaving, yeah.
[125:01.65]Sorry.
[125:13.05]Am I on a timer or something?
[125:14.19]Hold on.
[125:26.52]And he said he really thinks he- he thinks he is actually really funny, doesn't he?
[125:48.50]No, I don't.
[125:49.28]Fucking shot- it's remarkable that you're fucking still here.
[125:57.73]I look in the mirror every day and I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?
[126:00.25]What the fuck is happening?
[126:02.51]What the fuck are people doing here?
[126:04.91]No way!
[126:11.93]When I was scarcely three years old, me father was taking me for a small cut of venison, who me out in smokehouse.
[126:19.45]It was nearly a day dangling all the embers before me sisters found me.
[126:22.97]By then, I was already stricken with a black lung.
[126:25.75]The doctor said I shan't likely see my twelfth summer, and I wept.
[126:29.45]I'm about to go to the first room.
[126:47.72]Oh, nothing.
[126:50.26]Oh.
[127:04.87]Goodness.
[127:12.32]Bangers and mash.
[127:15.68]Sausage and mashed potatoes.
[127:18.68]Right?
[127:32.52]One dark winter's night, me father brought me and me sisters a lamb each, and put a single sheep knife between us.
[127:38.92]Mine, the runt of the litter, jolted as I made the cut.
[127:43.02]It bleated and bled for a fortnight, and I wept.
[127:56.05]Gross.
[127:59.93]Oh, here we go.
[128:01.39]What happens?
[128:02.31]It's going to be crazy.
[128:04.42]Oh, it actually is crazy.
[128:18.39]What the hell was that?
[128:23.01]Excellent work, lad.
[128:24.53]A fine cut indeed.
[128:31.82]Ooh, we got pie now.

[137:26.65]You wear like a 10 gallon hat around.
[137:28.05]Who cares?
[137:32.82]You could be a wicked cool fucking hat guy.
[137:35.05]If it bothers you, then you know, whatever.
[137:40.09]I like wearing hats.
[137:41.13]I like wearing cool hats.
[137:42.47]Everybody wears cool hats.
[137:46.89]See a guy walking around with a 10 gallon hat on you like that?
[137:49.41]That dude's fucking... Damn.
[137:51.02]You're fucking cool.
[137:58.31]I wear fucking hats all the time.
[137:59.61]I'm glad that's over.
[138:01.17]I can't stand the fuss.
[138:04.53]You're making it worse.
[138:18.04]Everyone's got a hat.
[138:20.48]What you should say is who fucking cares what anybody says about you.
[138:38.50]Are you fake?
[138:42.61]Hey, you tell him.
[138:43.35]Yeah.
[138:44.01]Hey, what do I always say?
[138:46.15]You do you.
[138:48.27]You do you, right?
[138:49.53]Come on.
[138:52.57]What am I saying?
[138:54.25]Better here than in the dump.
[139:01.67]I remember when somebody called me out on that, like, a couple years ago.
[139:04.43]They were like, hey, like, I feel like I've heard you say that and, like, heard of you saying that to, like, a dozen different people now.
[139:10.51]I was like, yeah, that's what I said.
[139:15.06]Yeah, you do, uh, you do you.
[139:16.78]It's, uh, go on.
[139:19.48]I've never liked to look a clock in the face.
[139:21.74]Oh!
[139:21.90]Hang on a minute.
[139:23.42]These watches are painted on.
[139:24.52]Oh, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee.
[139:38.70]You're in big trouble.
[139:42.76]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[139:43.38]I found him.
[139:43.78]I found him.
[139:44.06]I found him.
[139:44.30]He's right here.
[139:46.82]Fake watches.
[139:47.40]Fake watches.
[139:48.26]Fake watches.
[139:49.45]Where is the police officer?
[139:51.05]Fake watches.
[139:54.11]I'm not from around here.
[139:55.21]Fake watches.
[139:56.41]I don't think he cares.
[140:03.51]Why are you being such a snitch?
[140:08.88]I didn't.
[140:11.28]Excuse me.
[140:12.60]Excuse me.
[140:14.06]I was going to point in the other direction.
[140:17.56]Guys.
[140:20.98]Really?
[140:22.80]I'm bringing a bean tin.
[140:24.02]Hear my breath.
[140:25.20]Bring me beans or bring me death.
[140:35.58]Sure you were.
[140:41.22]We can do whatever.
[140:43.22]You're not only a snitch, you're a lying snitch.
[140:46.86]Wouldn't a lying snitch be so unreliable?
[140:54.47]That's not a snitch after all.
[140:56.13]You're so unreliable with everything you say.
[141:10.44]No, that would just be a liar.
[141:12.12]The beans are on the windowsill?
[141:19.76]Yeah.
[141:39.85]They are?
[141:40.23]Alright, here you go.
[142:12.59]Monk beds.
[142:16.41]Oops.
[142:17.47]Ew!
[142:22.89]What came out of your couch?
[142:31.68]He spilled the beans.
[142:33.02]Is that what it is?
[142:41.76]We'll deal with that later.
[142:48.54]We're gonna deal with that later.
[142:55.89]Is there anything else in the house?
[142:57.87]Uh, I think we have to interact with, uh... We need to interact with, uh... With you.
[143:13.49]What?
[143:13.63]Oh, I have to go find... Okay.
[143:14.77]Okay.
[143:15.03]I gotta go find birds.
[143:17.05]There's one.
[143:48.23]Okay, there's what, five more?
[143:49.76]His whole... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[144:00.40]Jumping around out there on the balcony while I sleep in my old-fashioned nightcap.
[144:04.01]What the fuck?
[144:04.75]I'm going to go back to my fucking bed.
[144:06.37]I'm trying to sleep here next to my bedside cabinet.
[144:11.05]Oh.
[144:17.16]Oh.
[144:18.22]No more birds over here.
[144:28.02]Bird.
[144:28.96]Two.
[144:32.64]Four more.
[144:53.26]These don't, these do not count, no.
[144:56.56]Three more?
[144:57.04]Two more.
[144:57.92]Milk.
[144:58.32]Eh?
[145:24.85]One more.
[145:25.17]Alright, this time I need to.
[145:40.17]I don't think I can do anything else here.
[145:53.98]Last seagull.
[146:04.31]Did I miss one or did I get them all?
[146:07.53]There we are.
[146:09.05]Alright, that's it.
[146:10.87]Oh, I just damage every post box.
[146:25.01]Yu-Gi-Oh.
[146:25.93]Alright, these are guys who counterfeit.
[146:28.58]Cool hats.
[146:29.26]Okay, I think I got them all.
[146:50.65]Yes.
[146:50.87]Wait, anything else you said?
[146:52.53]No.
[146:52.73]Alright, well, now what?
[147:16.70]excellent work cabin boy you retrieve my finest left tenants there's a bright future ahead of you on this ship attention thank you okay bye at ease man I can't imagine fighting somebody while sitting on the toilet
[147:49.30]Alright, what's... What is harder?
[147:52.41]Fighting somebody while you're sitting on the toilet or fighting somebody while you're in the bathtub?
[147:57.65]Like, in a full bath.
[148:00.04]I think it's still bath.
[148:05.72]They're both really... Yeah, but I still think it's... Actually, I don't know.
[148:13.02]The bath, I feel like you could just fly out of the bath.
[148:16.99]Just jump out like a fucking humpback whale.
[148:20.69]And just grab some, you know what I mean?
[148:23.56]But if you're on the toilet, that's a lot harder, I think.
[148:25.84]I don't know.
[148:50.66]We're here again.
[149:02.42]Your move is restricted in the bath.
[149:04.44]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[149:05.92]You could just launch out of it.
[149:07.92]And honestly, if somebody launches out majestically, like out of the bath, fucking with their arms up like Hunter from Left 4 Dead style.
[149:16.98]I don't think you're fucking going to win that one.
[149:21.40]I'm talking like the launch out of the bath.
[149:27.74]That would be a lot to deal with.
[149:31.12]Hang on a minute.
[149:32.84]These coasters are one way.
[149:39.46]Very strange.
[149:54.73]No, that's not a Five Nights at Freddy's jump scare.
[149:58.61]That's the... What the fuck just happened?
[150:11.56]I just did this again.
[150:16.68]I'll tell you, if I'm ever in a fucking bath and I've got to fight, I'm going to do it.
[150:20.76]I'm going to go.
[150:24.58]And then I'm fucking screaming while I jump out.
[150:44.47]It's got to be higher pitched.
[150:45.53]Yeah, but that means I have to actually scream and I don't want to scream.
[150:50.61]You don't understand.
[150:51.43]Do you play Left 4 Dead?
[150:52.41]Left 4 Dead 2?
[150:54.42]Oh, come on.
[150:55.76]I know that's a kind of older game.
[150:56.94]You guys should know Left 4 Dead.
[150:58.22]You guys, everybody knows Left 4 Dead.
[151:01.30]You know Left 4 Dead.
[151:03.68]Yeah, let's do it.
[151:14.89]Okay, I'm back here.
[151:15.73]Alright, where are my quests?
[151:26.68]I have to get the hammer from somebody.
[151:29.94]I need to go to the fishing place.
[151:31.52]It was fine in the 70s and it's fine now.
[151:40.85]You are all soft!
[151:49.78]Back in the buttery place.
[151:51.02]If somebody is 18 years old now, they were only three when Left 4 Dead 2 came out.
[151:56.30]What?
[151:56.46]Three?
[152:25.27]I am fucking flabbergasted.
[152:29.37]You were three?
[152:33.59]I cannot process that.
[152:34.59]My brain cannot process it.
[152:37.89]Some of you guys were fucking three.
[152:41.11]So no, me doing the bathtub.
[152:42.73]I'm going to fucking attack the guy and do the hunter voice.
[152:45.85]You were three.
[152:51.74]It's a great game though.
[152:52.44]You should definitely go play it.
[153:07.79]Can you sing all the themes that the boomers theme?
[153:10.68]I don't even know if I can.
[153:11.50]I know like that.
[153:14.52]That's Hunter.
[153:17.00]What is the boomer one?
[153:19.52]The boomer one is active.
[153:25.96]That's all I remember.
[153:32.01]That's not necessarily a song.
[153:51.82]Oh, the witch, I remember.
[153:53.64]What an awesome, what an amazing game.
[153:59.24]True teamwork.
[154:00.56]You had to, especially if you played on advanced or expert, everybody had to pull their weight.
[154:06.74]It was such a pull your weight game.
[154:10.22]One person startles the witch, the whole fucking thing is over.
[154:14.66]It's ruined, especially on expert.
[154:30.61]There was always one asshole that had the flashlight still on.
[154:33.03]They just didn't even care to turn it off.
[154:40.89]I could play that game all day.
[154:43.68]Oh, and I did.
[154:45.50]That was me.
[154:50.22]I would love to see Left 4 Dead continue.
[154:52.28]I'd love to see a continuation of any game that Valve is making.
[154:55.36]But I know Deadlock is something they're putting a ton of time into, but...
[155:00.12]I would love to see some more of that.
[155:02.64]I keep seeing Deadlock.
[155:04.46]That is a game that I am not going to play.
[155:08.28]You know when you see footage of a game and you just kind of count the UI elements and each UI element is kind of like a point dock on if you're actually going to be able to play it.
[155:20.96]I think at like nine UI elements, that's where I go.
[155:23.92]I don't think I can do this.
[155:25.96]I'm not sure I can do this.
[155:31.47]I remember playing Smite, and there was tons of these UI elements.
[155:35.27]There's a map, all these things to know, and all these... The shop and these combinations.
[155:41.52]The game looks really cool.
[155:43.12]It looks like fun.
[155:45.24]But I... No, I don't think so.
[155:48.25]I will watch that game.
[155:49.33]I will watch people play that game and go, damn, this is cool.
[155:52.93]I don't think I'm going to play it.
[156:05.95]Okay, I did the thing where I walked around in a circle and just talked for like two minutes, so.
[156:13.88]Alright, where am I?
[156:14.38]Where am I going?
[156:15.02]I gotta go to the fish place.
[156:16.48]I gotta go.
[156:17.21]I got the meat.
[156:19.91]Bro, you're just yapping.
[156:21.15]I know.
[156:21.61]I know.
[156:21.85]That's what I do.
[156:24.93]Trust me.
[156:27.90]Trust me, I know.
[156:28.70]I know.
[156:29.08]And when we're on the phone, when we're on the phone together and I start up and you're trying to just stop the conversation, trying to, you know, and then I start something else.
[156:39.53]Like, alright.
[156:40.81]Well, well, alright.
[156:44.21]Did you see the paper?
[156:45.45]Like, yeah, I saw the paper.
[156:51.13]I can't.
[156:51.42]Did you see the front page?
[156:53.06]I did.
[156:54.08]Yeah.
[156:55.00]Alright.
[156:57.63]I'm sorry.
[156:58.25]Apologize to everybody.
[156:59.05]Alright, where the fuck am I going?
[157:03.98]I've lost.
[157:11.68]Back in the hole.
[157:13.99]See, I told you.
[157:14.49]This is why I play these games.
[157:17.93]With chat.
[157:25.32]It's funny I say that, but I actually don't, I actually like notoriously, I don't like talking that much on the phone.
[157:36.65]I do and I don't.
[157:38.33]I am so extreme when it comes to phone conversation because I either want to talk your fucking ear off for two or three hours or I want to talk to you for 30 seconds and please God fucking hang the phone up.
[157:52.88]I just, it can't be in between for me.
[157:56.37]We are either going to have a like, let's talk about everything and everything conversation, or I'm going to be very quick with you and then I'm done.
[158:09.03]I can't do like a five minute phone call.
[158:10.45]Can't do a 10 minute phone call.
[158:11.43]Can't do 30 minute phone call.
[158:12.47]Nope.
[158:12.73]Never happens.
[158:17.92]Those of you that can do that.
[158:19.26]Oh, I envy that superpower because I cannot.
[158:40.38]Alright, I'm back here.
[158:43.12]Yeah, I remember this.
[158:44.14]Now I gotta go.
[158:44.76]Is this where the... Alright, there.
[158:46.94]It's over this way, right?
[159:06.08]Anything else in here?
[159:07.86]Should I do something else in here?
[159:10.28]No.
[159:10.46]Anything need doing?
[159:41.06]Alright, everybody scream if I'm going the wrong way.
[159:44.60]Am I going the wrong way?
[159:48.13]Oh, I'm about to go.
[159:52.87]OK, thank you.
[159:53.27]Are we gonna go?
[160:05.23]Ooh, that thing's almost perfectly toasted.
[160:09.71]I only took you, it only took you two hours.
[160:13.99]Heavily tested, but it only, I mean, it's hell might, it only took you two hours to do.
[160:24.69]Can I even go this way?
[160:27.43]Wait, were you guys messing around?
[160:28.79]I think I was actually supposed to go over there.
[160:33.24]Yeah, oh my god, okay.
[160:35.10]I, there's nowhere else to go.
[160:39.72]How do you all collectively do that at the exact same time?
[160:44.53]And get it?
[160:45.81]That was the amount of screams that I saw where there's no way this is correct.
[160:51.40]Hey, and by the way, stop screaming.
[160:52.98]Will you relax?
[160:55.74]Take a breath.
[160:56.50]Have a tea.
[161:07.89]Britten.
[161:46.18]Alright, can I actually jump over this?
[161:49.13]No.
[162:01.78]Maserati doesn't show their cars at car shows anymore.
[162:04.52]What they do as Rolls-Royce, they don't show their cars at car shows.
[162:08.10]What they do is they show it at boats and yacht shows.
[162:11.55]Because it looks really, really expensive if you have a car at a car show.
[162:16.75]But next to a boat, next to a yacht, what it does is a $25 million boat or a $25 million jet, a Rolls-Royce looks like it's an impulse buy.
[162:30.46]Oh, and I forgot to put the music behind it.
[162:45.91]I'm so awful to this guy.
[162:47.37]Go on, off with you now.
[162:52.95]Don't be coming back here.
[163:03.70]Yeah, you do.
[163:04.04]You make a lot of messes in this game, that's for sure.
[163:08.10]Come on, let's get her open!
[163:10.42]Oh, my... Am I supposed to get to a certain height?
[163:28.66]Am I supposed to get to a certain Kenneth height?
[163:33.19]Where's my character?
[163:35.69]Oh.
[163:36.25]I'm trying.
[163:36.81]Am I so bad at this that I can't... Okay.
[164:13.04]Where the fuck am I at?
[164:21.88]Let me down.
[164:31.20]What?
[164:33.86]Wait.
[164:34.22]What is this?
[164:49.24]My beautiful baby boy.
[164:53.02]And bigger than I thought.
[165:01.53]Cream of the crop.
[165:03.97]Cream of the crop.
[165:06.31]Cream of the crop.
[165:07.43]That's right.
[165:08.21]Oh, yeah.
[165:08.93]Oh, man.
[165:09.49]Oh, man.
[165:15.77]What can I do you for?
[165:17.47]Sorry to bother you, Herbert, but there's been reports of crime in the area.
[165:22.03]Shit!
[165:22.89]That's right.
[165:23.55]Have you seen this criminal at all?
[165:25.97]Hang on a minute, that's no criminal.
[165:28.20]That's the honest businessman who sold me this brand new watering can.
[165:32.42]I'm afraid that's no businessman.
[165:34.14]That's bootleg, Bill.
[165:35.84]And that's no watering can.
[165:38.06]Alright, I'm sorry Brett, like...
[166:04.18]British humor is funny.
[166:05.83]British humor is funny.
[166:07.63]All you laughing and +2-ing.
[166:10.41]You know, this is the English humor is getting you.
[166:12.53]It's getting you.
[166:28.83]Kind of true, yeah.
[166:44.03]Good humor.
[166:44.91]I think they said something rarely we see on your stream.
[166:47.01]Get me out of here.
[167:02.38]Can I wake him up?
[167:14.54]can't go over there.
[167:26.19]Know your veg.
[167:27.83]Carrot.
[167:28.55]Peas.
[167:29.55]Patty.
[167:30.63]Corn on the cob.
[167:31.65]Corn off the cob.
[167:33.57]Apple.
[167:34.41]Beans.
[167:35.22]Wet.
[167:36.12]Lager.
[167:45.74]That's just a little teehee.
[167:47.20]That's just a little teehee on the poster there.
[167:56.71]Hello?
[168:04.93]Paint?
[168:05.25]What are you doing?
[168:28.82]Ah, that's better.
[168:29.75]I tell you what, I can't see out on the ground, mate.
[168:32.03]I don't know how them badgers do it.
[168:33.17]Guys, I... I nod.
[168:34.47]You know, moles and badgers are a type of dog.
[168:37.43]Guys, I'm sorry.
[168:37.97]I'm American.
[168:39.93]As an American, the only thing I've understood and the only funny thing is I punch people and they go, ah!
[168:48.62]That's the only... I'm sorry.
[168:49.96]I'm an American.
[168:54.35]And you know what?
[168:54.83]I ain't going to apologize.
[169:12.54]Don't forget.
[169:13.98]Don't forget where the Looney Tunes came from.
[169:17.58]Do not forget where the Looney Tunes... Don't forget where the Three Stooges came from.
[169:21.89]The Three Stooges were not English.
[169:25.27]Sorry.
[169:36.00]The Three Stooges are mid.
[169:39.70]I, that's... Now, what are you going to say?
[169:42.98]Ernest is mid?
[169:43.70]And if you say that, then that's an actual permanent ban from the channel.
[169:48.72]Like, you go on to say that Ernest is mid.
[169:51.65]That's a permanent, that's a permanent, that's a permanent ban from the channel.
[169:58.37]Careful here.
[169:58.81]This little dude's a menace.
[170:09.05]Okay, I'm looking for the mole.
[170:10.35]Where's the little mole?
[170:12.01]Remember the mole was like, hey, come visit me sometime.
[170:21.47]I think that was him that popped up, right?
[170:29.70]There's snails too.
[170:33.68]Nothing?
[170:36.22]What about Tom and Jerry?
[170:38.85]Yeah.
[170:40.83]My dad loves earnest, scared, stupid.
[170:45.99]Dad sounds like an incredibly, highly functioning, highly, incredibly intelligent person.
[170:51.17]Okay, I think I can...
[171:02.21]Ernest in Fortnite?
[171:03.13]No.
[171:03.71]No.
[171:04.05]Uh-uh.
[171:04.79]Nope.
[171:05.63]Nope.
[171:05.83]Uh-uh.
[171:07.77]No.
[171:08.09]Uh-uh.
[171:08.51]No.
[171:08.75]Didn't you steal something?
[171:12.95]Yeah, we're talking massive IQ.
[171:33.62]Somewhere into at least the 130s or 140s.
[171:44.95]Ah, good idea.
[171:45.88]You can go in and all.
[171:49.18]Did you see that bird area?
[171:51.28]That's our bed, that is.
[171:53.58]Ah, Bubba bought it back for four pundits.
[171:56.21]Wait, there's maybe other stuff down here.
[171:58.00]I think it's just the hammer.
[172:11.93]Ernest sucks.
[172:13.78]Ban that person forever.
[172:15.78]Ban that person forever.
[172:17.32]They think it's a joke.
[172:18.02]Ban that person forever.
[172:18.98]Oh, catch of the day.
[172:20.80]You've been up to some mischief with us, I'll bet.
[172:23.60]What you on about, Jasper?
[172:24.95]I don't know.
[172:26.35]Wait till you and Moe hears about this.
[172:29.07]I'm taking this back to my toolbox and I'll see you at the triple, lad.
[172:32.85]Jasper, you puppy doing me nothing.
[172:41.51]How did I?
[172:41.97]OK.
[172:48.03]Baby girl.
[173:01.50]That's the hammer.
[173:05.66]Why are you bald?
[173:07.62]I don't know, because some people are bald.
[173:11.28]I think you need to get over him.
[173:12.64]Ooh.
[173:12.84]No!
[173:13.24]Ah.
[173:37.30]That seems kind of nice actually.
[173:42.14]This is what it means to be British.
[173:43.38]This is what it means to be English because.
[173:49.77]And this is seems pretty nice.
[173:51.45]Man.
[174:19.08]I'm only doing this because it... Well, I would have appreciated the sign earlier.
[174:25.76]Oh, you can't get out.
[174:41.01]He's doing the Austin Powers.
[174:59.92]I didn't.
[175:00.32]I don't know.
[175:00.94]I thought they were like.
[175:04.14]What am I?
[175:04.50]I don't know.
[175:04.94]That's an achievement for doing that.
[175:09.24]I did this sign was not aware.
[175:15.59]OK, if the sign is back here, I will shut up.
[175:19.03]There's no sign.
[175:21.49]If I saw leave alone, I wouldn't have.
[175:23.63]This is a game about punching things.
[175:25.17]Look, there's no sign.
[175:29.84]Here's one to live by.
[175:31.49]Never put a shoe in a shoe.
[175:33.85]Hmm.
[175:47.88]Still stuck over here?
[175:52.56]Okay.
[175:53.78]Hammer is back.
[175:56.92]Oh, they seem to be getting along now.
[176:04.46]I want to go in here.
[176:08.02]You're spreading the seeds.
[176:10.87]That's true.
[176:11.35]That's true.
[176:19.37]Can I do anything with this or are you just angry?
[176:28.46]I'm boiling the kettle.
[176:41.40]Alright, there's gotta be one more thing in here, right?
[176:45.66]Are you still angry?
[176:48.67]Do you guys have any more monster energy?
[176:50.99]I couldn't think of a single food item.
[177:18.06]That was even relevant to anybody.
[177:19.82]What do you guys even drink?
[177:21.98]What do you guys drink?
[177:24.42]I'm trying to be relevant to the audience.
[177:27.96]What do you guys even drink?
[177:31.48]Like monster energy.
[177:32.26]That's like not even like a meme anymore.
[177:34.40]That's like old meme.
[177:43.04]Dr. Pepper.
[177:46.01]Gatorade tea.
[177:51.45]milk, gin and tonic, Arizona iced tea.
[177:54.40]It's good.
[177:54.94]That's a good one.
[178:00.74]I love I love that Arizona iced tea guy.
[178:03.70]But it's still 99 cents, right?
[178:05.34]And he's like, we're just going to keep it there.
[178:19.67]Sounds like he's nearly finished.
[178:25.05]Oh, here's the pipe puzzle I told you.
[178:54.84]Uh... Ooh!
[179:09.96]Alright, Marge, that's your pipes all cleaned out, and I fixed the fryer.
[179:14.50]Oh, thanks, lovey.
[179:16.86]I hope it wasn't too much bother.
[179:19.10]I'll put you some chippies on.
[179:21.22]I nae bother at all.
[179:23.06]But where does all that oil drain out to, anyway?
[179:27.36]Oh, I've got no clue, love.
[179:38.37]Is that a deep fry?
[179:39.77]A deep fried baby?
[179:40.99]What the fuck?
[179:53.50]Well.
[179:56.33]I guess we did it.
[180:06.54]I feel like I'm scared to go out this door.
[180:14.68]You saved the town, yeah.
[180:18.94]Everybody alright?
[180:19.54]Everybody doing okay?
[180:27.35]I'm just gonna hold up my phone, like selfie mode, and just be walking around town pointing at everything, all the horrible, and just be like, I'm sorry everybody, just want to make sure everybody knows I'm wicked sorry.
[180:36.14]Uh, apologize for all this crazy shit that I fucking fucked up.
[180:44.79]No, you burnt it.
[180:51.45]You burnt it.
[180:55.50]There's a fine line between burnt toast and good toast.
[181:00.41]And you botched it.
[181:14.08]This, okay, this bag is just, it just wants me to open it, right?
[181:20.60]But yeah, come on.
[181:21.14]This is a game about like punching items and opening bags.
[181:25.83]It's just bait.
[181:30.83]Alright, so what's left?
[181:35.27]What's the next thing?
[181:37.96]I did the meat, I did the fishing, there was one more thing to do.
[181:43.04]What was it?
[181:44.64]Oh, hold on.
[181:50.07]Oh dear, poor lad's in a right state.
[181:54.87]I'd see what's wrong, but Bobby says I've got to stay away from windows now.
[182:04.54]Oh, hello there, young man.
[182:05.72]Thank goodness you're here.
[182:07.82]I've got this delicious cup of tea here, you see.
[182:10.42]But I'm afraid it's as black as a bin bag in there.
[182:13.49]It really is.
[182:14.65]I'd go and get some more milk.
[182:16.07]I would.
[182:17.43]The trouble is, I'm afraid I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm milk shy.
[182:23.44]Oh, God.
[182:24.12]Alright.
[182:34.17]Oh, I just put my feet in there.
[182:40.30]Oh, no, I... Wait, I want to go back in.
[183:06.24]Okay, we need milk.
[183:13.57]Only pulp?
[183:17.59]Alright, normal milk.
[183:18.81]Gonna be fairly abnormal.
[183:30.87]I'd say it's going to be fairly abnormal milk, considering the flushness of your face and the annoyingness that you came into the clinic.
[183:40.28]You're fairly annoying.
[183:41.14]Oh, thank goodness you're here, lad.
[183:47.90]Ah, Bessie's sick as a fig.
[183:49.98]Chippies usually perk her up, though.
[183:52.66]Oh, you couldn't go up to Marge's and get us some, could you?
[184:01.71]She's neither use nor ornament until she's had her chippies.
[184:05.45]Chippies?
[184:06.61]Poor cow.
[184:09.21]I know where to get chippies.
[184:20.37]I gotta go back to the fish and chips place.
[184:26.80]Isn't that far away?
[184:30.25]That's all the way over here.
[184:32.17]I will get to you all.
[184:37.33]Uh-oh.
[184:41.55]I can't believe this, Q!
[184:43.77]I've been here for 40 minutes!
[184:46.45]Marge!
[184:47.47]Come on, hurry up!
[184:49.03]I'm eating for two here!
[184:51.63]And I'm pregnant!
[184:53.31]Where you turn, love?
[185:05.87]Could I have some too?
[185:06.65]How do we speed this up?
[185:16.36]Can I help?
[185:43.04]Go around?
[185:44.19]Okay, well, I'll help.
[185:53.45]Gone for chips.
[185:57.08]What happened?
[185:58.72]I finished them all off.
[186:04.44]The big one needed both hands.
[186:07.08]Oh, that's... That's partly my fault.
[186:12.52]Partly.
[186:14.44]Partly.
[186:17.32]Partly my fault, considering the annoying flushness of your face kept in here.
[186:22.11]Do you live nearby?
[186:23.93]What do you do for work?
[186:27.55]Test him for... Chlamydia.
[186:31.37]Gonorrhea.
[186:39.18]Uh.

[194:40.78]I just heard it.
[194:41.32]It was like... Yeah, it did sound like a duck.

[195:35.63]She's my muse, you see.
[195:37.83]What's a muse, Ronnie?
[195:39.52]Well, Larry, when it's late at night, you're all alone in your bed, and you're caught in the throes of your own carnal desire.
[195:49.30]And you're, you know, reaching a rhythm with yourself.
[195:52.94]You know, Larry, you're tugging your button.
[195:55.32]When you reach your crescendo, who is it that you picture?
[196:00.80]Could I get some service, please?
[196:30.42]Is there anything else for me to do in here maybe?
[196:32.76]Is that a bad idea?
[196:33.42]I just want to see if there's anything new.
[196:41.78]It's a lot less blue in here now.

[221:00.46]Buy one, get one free.
[221:02.99]He slapped it on the door, on the front of the ice cream parlor and changed everything.
[221:08.39]The business took off immediately after that.
[221:11.29]Carvel ice cream.

[225:27.92]I aged.
[225:29.93]Like, this dude, there's no way.
[225:31.85]How does he, like, go from looking like this to looking like that after 24 years?
[225:35.51]Like, that doesn't make any sense.
[225:43.17]Oh, dear.
[225:44.75]Oh, this is the very last thing I wanted to happen.
[225:47.01]Oh, shit, I just killed that thing.
[225:52.89]Oh, dear.
[225:53.25]24 years of eating beans in a can.
[226:02.97]Yeah, whatever.
[226:06.11]Last year you said you were 38.
[226:07.03]Which is it?
[226:07.75]That's true.
[226:08.27]I feel kind of bad.
[226:13.84]I like snails.
[226:45.23]Oh there's another one going down the well!
[226:49.93]Oh dear.
[226:54.01]Oh no!
[227:01.04]Are you going to be 40 next year?
[227:04.56]Yeah, I know.
[227:05.52]And I'm looking forward to getting the card.
[227:09.56]Here's the thing about 40.
[227:10.30]40-year-olds, unlike anybody else in human history, they get all the most elaborate cards.
[227:21.32]I'm talking birthday cards.
[227:24.08]These cards, they talk.
[227:26.06]They make sounds.
[227:27.29]They play music.
[227:28.67]There is a huge market for 40-year-old shit.
[227:32.97]We're talking cards.
[227:33.75]We're talking gifts.
[227:35.01]And yes, I'm going to open that card up.
[227:36.95]And it's going to start playing in a very, very, very kind of compressed audio.
[227:40.82]Like... It's going to be a fart.
[227:45.34]Like one of those compressed fart sounds.
[227:47.12]And it's going to go... Oh, you made it to 40.
[227:50.45]Yeah.
[227:53.89]And if you open it and close it at the right kind of spawn point, you can make it go like... You're farty.
[228:10.04]And I'm going to do that.
[228:10.62]It's going to make me very happy.
[228:12.28]I'm going to do it for like an hour.
[228:14.82]There's a massive market for like 40-year-old kind of paraphernalia.
[228:28.54]There's like trinkets and toys and cards.
[228:37.40]I'm going to get a golf ball that says borrow on it.
[228:39.86]And it's going to be like time to tee off.
[228:43.83]That thing makes a fart sound too, by the way.
[228:51.48]A little off-piste here, but another thing Worms really love.
[228:55.12]A rooster's egg.
[228:56.44]It's not an easy snatch, but by god is the protein worth it.
[229:06.07]The world around this is... everything just keeps kind of getting... Like, I'm kind of fucking up this whole town.
[229:13.43]Those eyes are looking at me.
[229:21.64]Kind of wild to be almost 30.
[229:22.58]How'd you all do it?
[229:24.08]Honestly, I mean this.
[229:26.14]I'm not messing around.
[229:28.50]Your 30s actually are probably some of the best, like, better period of your life.
[229:32.78]At least they were for me.
[229:35.84]I think a lot of people think 30 is, oh my god, okay, fucking that's it.
[229:40.18]No, no way, dude.
[229:43.34]I feel like my, like, 31 to, like, 30, you know, here I am right now.
[229:47.94]I feel like, guys, this is where things start to kind of click.
[229:53.18]Um, it took into like my kind of mid thirties, I'd say.
[229:57.09]And I'm not talking about necessarily, I'm talking about mainly like how you feel about stuff, like who you are.
[230:03.67]You, you, you kind of get it figured out.
[230:06.05]At least I didn't pass like through the thirties.
[230:11.76]More cigarettes.
[230:16.00]Oh, oh, a pipe.
[230:21.58]Not that one, bud.
[230:24.96]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[230:26.56]Whoa.
[230:26.88]Uh... Huh?

[231:48.56]How is this cleared up now?
[231:54.92]What's the next word?
[231:55.78]Another thrilling installment of the newspaper.
[232:00.28]Mm-hmm.
[232:05.08]No, not again.
[232:07.22]Is that a piece of cheese?
[232:09.10]Ooh, feels good.
[232:16.55]What?
[232:26.83]Ooh, no, stop.
[232:28.33]What?
[232:36.78]Okay, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[232:48.25]I'm getting a whole lot of Steam achievements.
[233:05.44]You're nearly at Big Ron's.
[233:10.62]Oh, by the way, I have an announcement to make.
[233:20.41]I have an announcement to make about burgers.
[233:24.30]I have a burger tier list.
[233:25.84]The burger tier list is pretty final.
[233:28.72]Shake Shack has moved down like two full letter grades down to like a B or a C. But there is a new king in town.
[233:36.67]There is a new king in town.
[233:38.87]It is S+.
[233:39.51]It trumps every single other one.
[233:43.33]I've finally had it.
[233:45.35]I'd heard about it a few different times.
[233:49.51]And I finally got a chance to have it.
[233:52.66]And I had a chance to have it.
[233:55.12]I'm talking about the habit.
[233:57.76]That is the single, probably best, quick burger I've ever had.
[234:03.55]That was un-fucking-believably good.
[234:06.23]It was unbelievable.
[234:12.57]That is up at S.
[234:14.03]100%.
[234:14.23]And I never had it before.
[234:16.33]And I think it was on the list and I was like, I don't know.
[234:20.71]Five Guys has dropped down.
[234:22.40]The habit has taken its place.
[234:25.72]The Five Guys actually has gone down in probably a couple of rungs over the last probably year or two for me.
[234:36.98]Yes, it's the habit.
[234:39.36]That's... I had it.
[234:40.26]I was like, well, I've never had it before.
[234:41.66]I guess it's pretty damn good.
[234:45.68]I had In-N-Out again, and it was like, hmm, this is pretty damn good too.
[234:51.37]But I have my own issues with In-N-Out.
[234:53.95]You guys already know.
[234:55.21]You know me.
[234:56.33]I don't reckon Out can be too big.
[234:58.55]Does that know?
[234:59.57]People used to rip me for my head and all.
[235:02.18]Really?
[235:02.64]Aye.
[235:03.42]At school, they used to call me Panhead.
[235:05.58]And the kids would call me Fathead.
[235:08.18]But look at me now.
[235:09.90]I've made big my business.
[235:12.30]And I've done alright.
[235:14.41]That's a chat classic.
[235:16.37]That's a chat classic.
[235:18.39]Okay.
[235:50.63]This bag is going to open and something's going to jump out and scream at me.
[235:53.82]It's so, it's such bait.
[235:55.20]Look, you know it's going to happen.
[236:00.34]What kind of burger did you get from The Habit?
[236:01.96]Just the default.
[236:03.24]I think it's called like the charburger.
[236:04.56]It's just the regular.
[236:06.19]Didn't change anything on it.
[236:08.95]It was very, it was very good.
[236:17.52]Did somebody say, how is it taking you this long to beat this?
[236:20.08]Oh, yeah, that's just how it is here.
[236:22.34]It's like, hey, Jerma, can you play, like, The Witcher 3?
[236:25.08]That'll be, like, a 16-fucking-year-long playthrough.
[236:28.49]Do you know what?
[236:30.59]That's just not gonna happen.
[236:43.38]What about Wukong?
[236:44.04]I actually played Wukong.
[236:45.08]I played like the first two, I want to say hour or two.
[236:48.02]I was actually, I was impressed.
[236:49.52]I was impressed.
[236:50.10]I thought it was really, it felt like really fun.
[236:52.20]There was some pretty cool boss encounters.
[236:54.42]I thought it was pretty fun.
[236:56.62]I have not played the whole thing.
[236:58.15]The first impression was, seemed pretty fun.
[237:02.37]Although I have not gone past like the very, very beginning, the intro.
[237:13.41]Okay, where am I going?
[237:20.28]Well, you sold out of everything.
[237:27.25]Hey, any news on all the Bloodborne clips you're hoarding?
[237:30.88]Yeah, I, that's right.
[237:32.34]I, yeah, I forgot about that.
[237:33.64]I do have, I have a, like a dragon horde of like 200 Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne clips, and like Dark Souls 3, and just like, I don't know, like Red Dead Redemption 2.
[237:48.53]There might even be like a FIFA clip in there.
[237:50.29]It's just a bunch of random ass shit.
[237:54.89]Um.
[237:56.23]But some of them are and I was literally was got hurt laughing at it.
[238:00.61]You know when you kind of rewind 5 seconds, watch something happen, rewind 5 seconds and like it hurts to laugh, but you keep like hurting yourself.
[238:09.88]And you could just stop it at anytime.
[238:13.86]FIFA clips.
[238:19.93]I don't even know the rules of soccer.
[238:23.66]I don't.
[238:24.10]I genuinely do not know.
[238:25.86]I understand.
[238:26.34]I watch baseball.
[238:27.36]I watch football.
[238:28.66]American football.
[238:29.40]Sorry, I'm an American, right?
[238:30.60]I'm a tourist here.
[238:33.39]I don't even understand how soccer even works.
[238:36.15]I just know it's like, oh yeah, the game's over.
[238:37.89]Just kidding.
[238:38.41]And no, it isn't.
[238:39.41]Like, I guess we're like in negative time now.
[238:41.51]And I'm just like, I don't understand what's happening.
[238:43.91]Like, the penalties were added.
[238:45.74]I don't know.
[238:46.68]The timer went to zero.
[239:03.93]N.A.
[239:04.29]Brain.
[239:14.94]They only do that during Daylight Savings.
[239:18.20]Oh, like they add the time during Daylight Savings.
[239:21.68]What, because the game is an hour earlier or something?
[239:49.57]Come in.
[239:52.07]Let me in.
[239:55.02]Oh look, everyone's here.

[248:23.31]Bash that mole until it's dead.
[248:26.83]Cut straight through that lovely crust.
[248:30.06]I don't feel soup, but what needs most?
[248:31.68]Splash me open, Mikey, too.
[248:37.00]Steady home, this bed's brand new.
[248:40.74]I think they need a little more.
[248:45.43]Hang on, why is it me and so?
[248:48.95]Oh, Reggie's quite unwell.
[248:54.19]Now we've hit the overload.
[248:57.64]Tender's flying down the road.
[248:59.30]Got me head off.
[249:02.02]I'm a fish.
[249:04.44]Who taught you to drive like this?
[249:07.84]Looks like Ronnie's on the shot.
[249:10.52]What is going on?
[249:11.44]He needs to chop some mar, of course.
[249:14.79]Easy now, let's keep it civil.
[249:18.25]Look at little Reggie dribble.
[249:21.61]Now I'll come back to you tonight.
[249:23.21]And there's flying like a kite.
[249:28.40]Don't be shy, I'll hack you off.
[249:31.84]I just can't run, we're off the cuff.
[249:35.30]Poor old Ronnie's fish is catched.
[249:38.65]We'll put them in the fryer next.
[249:42.19]How the chuff did you get there?
[249:44.91]How do I get out of this?
[249:46.04]Am I fucking this up?
[249:48.12]I mean, I love this, but am I doing it wrong?
[249:56.22]Pop the ball, he's in our hole.
[249:59.34]Crush his head, he's nearly dead.
[250:01.05]But look out, he's dead.
[250:02.75]Crush that box and squash these two.
[250:04.61]Eat it up, it's good for you.
[250:06.19]But I'm the nail nail, please don't fuss.
[250:07.73]It's better if you stay with us.
[250:09.59]Time's ticking, ticky-tock.
[250:11.35]Get him, bash him, make him stop.
[250:12.97]You have the right to get knocked out.
[250:14.75]Chop that fish, your blood comes out.
[250:16.46]I miss my dad, I miss my mom.
[250:18.24]In your tummy, yum, yum, yum.
[250:19.82]I love the smashy-bangy sound.
[250:20.98]Don't be coy now, stay quiet.
[250:22.66]This is crazy.
[250:24.02]That was wild.
[250:25.02]I very much enjoyed that.
[250:26.60]Oh, okay.
[250:57.07]Back where we started.
[250:58.03]Oh, thank goodness you're here.
[251:06.67]Thank goodness you're here.
[251:07.69]I'm just about to tuck into this delicious Amsani.
[251:10.59]I have lost the mayoral mustard.
[251:18.52]Uh, that's it.
[251:20.36]Oh, I've never seen one as big as that before.
[251:25.44]That was lovely.
[251:28.54]That was great.
[251:32.32]Excellent work.
[251:32.90]That was very funny.
[251:34.36]I like when you joked that.
[251:36.48]I'm not going to even say the rest of it.
[251:39.98]Let me turn it down a little.
[251:59.92]That was very nice.
[252:01.68]I very much like that.
[252:13.40]That's a goofy game.
[252:19.39]Yeah.
[252:23.55]When I saw, I saw like one or two little pieces of it, like the very, very beginning there.
[252:29.09]I was like, I kind of want to play that.
[252:31.81]It feels like a, just a chill game to laugh at and just relax and, you know, talk a little, talk a little shit, right?
[252:40.48]You should play Left 4 Dead.
[252:43.76]That, that might be kind of fun.
[252:47.39]Get the four horsemen, play Left 4 Dead or something.
[253:01.43]I think we were talking about playing something at some point soon here anyways.
[253:09.87]Yeah, and I am not going to be gone for like two months.
[253:15.34]Just this last... I mean, it's been more than a few months of just kind of bouncing around, trying to get shit together.
[253:24.70]But I'm good.
[253:25.32]I'm good.
[253:25.85]Things are good.
[253:34.61]What about Papa's Pizzeria?
[253:35.69]I don't know.
[253:37.75]There's a lot of stuff.
[253:38.37]I have a huge catalog of stuff.
[253:40.49]Here's the thing.
[253:41.43]When you don't stream that much anymore, there are a million things that keep coming out that I keep going, oh, that would be kind of interesting.
[253:50.56]That would be kind of interesting.
[253:52.00]That would be kind of fun.
[253:53.54]And it's like, oh, I got a lot of stuff I could play.
[253:57.00]So there's a lot of stuff to do.
[254:04.50]Yeah, you can anticipate I'll be live like within the next week or two.
[254:10.12]Not two months.
[254:12.54]We're talking like a week or two, maybe.
[254:14.08]I do want to play that UFO 50 game too.
[254:19.03]Don't you lie.
[254:32.51]No, I don't think I have a reason to.
[254:36.79]What about Angerfoot?
[254:41.83]That did come out.
[254:42.44]That's right.
[254:42.82]Yeah, when I get a better idea in the next week or so, I'll pop in here and let you know.
[254:49.50]Where's the podcast?
[254:49.96]Yeah.
[255:02.55]Are you going to dress to impress?
[255:05.22]Uh, not really.
[255:06.16]I'm in kind of just jogging pants.
[255:10.22]Oh, you're talking about the, okay, you're talking about the Roblox game.
[255:17.50]Okay, I see what you're talking about.
[255:25.11]Dress to impress, question mark?
[255:26.65]Like, you're going to dress up for this?
[255:30.93]I will tell you a few things.
[255:32.06]I'm going to, let me, I'm going to drop this a little bit so I can talk.
[255:36.74]There are a couple of things that I think I want you guys to know are going to happen.
[255:39.50]And I want you to look forward to a couple of things.
[255:42.10]Uh, we don't need any music.
[255:42.96]Do you remember last year how I had a Halloween stream that I wanted to do and it didn't happen?
[255:50.78]I got like sick.
[255:56.61]That is, um, that is,
[256:00.83]on the cards.
[256:03.09]Wanted to do it last year and it's so stupid.
[256:06.01]And it's probably not going to be funny, but you know what?
[256:07.75]We're going for it.
[256:09.29]So I do want to do like a Halloween, maybe not Halloween night.
[256:14.79]But like in that like kind of week of Halloween, I want to do like a play horror games and do that routine that I thought was stupid.
[256:24.71]There's a lot of things I have to kind of figure out here as well in this like kind of slowed down period.
[256:32.12]Um, I got to figure out what to do with the Discord because got to figure out how to manage that space better just because I'm not really around anymore.
[256:41.81]And I got to think of some ways to some creative ways to make it.
[256:45.79]Cause I like that space actually.
[256:47.01]I like having the Discord.
[256:49.93]So kind of try to come up with over the next couple of weeks here, maybe try to come up with a more manageable solution for some of it.
[257:00.17]Make some potions.
[257:04.67]That should be kind of fun.
[257:17.14]Is Bugleberry going to be around?
[257:21.09]I don't know.
[257:25.17]I'll have to call him.
[257:26.41]I'll have to give him a call and see what he's up to.
[257:32.54]Maybe.
[257:34.95]I think you're going to get a different guy on Halloween.
[257:40.67]I don't know if it's... I don't know if Bugleberry is going to be available.
[257:44.36]Somebody else is.
[257:47.42]And I can't wait for this to come totally full circle.
[257:51.66]That my introducing a new Halloween character, people are going to be begging to bring the original hated Halloween character back.
[258:02.02]God, I love it.
[258:07.29]What a great complete circle that's going to be.
[258:12.87]But yeah, I'm still around.
[258:13.61]I'm still kicking around.
[258:14.61]Things are going well.
[258:15.25]You know, just keeping on, right?
[258:24.79]If you were around in the offline chat, I kind of mentioned that.
[258:28.05]It was kind of, shit was kind of just all over the place the last six months.
[258:31.53]But I am, my head is screwed on.
[258:34.59]It's tight.
[258:35.67]I'm good.
[258:36.05]I'm good to go.
[258:39.79]Otto is going to be good with his high hopes that he's going to make it through all this.
[258:45.73]And if he's got a nose problem for the rest of his life until, you know, then we'll, you know, we'll figure it out.
[258:57.00]Why was your head screwed off?
[259:00.14]I don't think it was screwed off.
[259:02.00]It was a little loose, though.
[259:03.78]It was loose.
[259:05.93]Needed some maintenance.
[259:11.45]But I think I'll call it here.
[259:13.39]That was Thank Goodness You're Here.
[259:15.27]It was a fun, fun game.
[259:19.43]I liked it a lot.
[259:21.69]And then in the next week or so, I will update the sus.
[259:29.98]And we'll do it again.
[259:34.42]Take care.
[259:35.74]Have a good one.
[259:38.44]Have a good rest of your day.
[259:39.70]I know it's kind of early still for a lot of people.
[259:42.21]I started pretty early, so.
[259:44.37]But yeah, call your mother.
[259:46.19]You know what to do.
[259:48.75]Take it easy.
[259:49.59]Have a great night.
[259:50.09]Have a great afternoon.
[259:51.63]It's still pretty early.
