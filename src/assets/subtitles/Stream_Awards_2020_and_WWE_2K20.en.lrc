[01:02.28]Yeah, happy... Well, not yet.
[01:03.60]Not yet.
[01:05.63]I figured I would start a little early just because I was thinking about it.
[01:08.95]And...
[01:10.62]If I started at 6.30, because I want to hit Eastern time, right?
[01:15.28]Like the New York City, that's when the ball drops.
[01:17.10]The big ball in New York City, right?
[01:19.24]I want to hit Eastern time.
[01:21.18]So that's only like two hours.
[01:25.43]What?
[01:26.07]6.30, 7.30, 8.30, 9.30, 10.30, 11.30.
[01:27.53]That's only two and a half hours.
[01:30.95]We got 19 categories to go through and an entire rumble card.
[01:35.43]So this might be a little longer than I initially anticipated.
[01:38.53]So let's start early.
[01:41.48]Get going.
[01:43.64]I can't even count these subscribers.
[01:46.84]Oh, my God.

[01:55.06]All right.
[01:56.16]The number just jumped up.
[01:58.52]Anyways, let's just hang out for a little bit.
[02:00.41]I got all the categories.

[02:49.67]Anyways, uh, we got a lot to do.
[02:52.01]Happy, I mean, can you see it?
[02:54.59]Happy New Year?

[02:57.91]So.
[02:59.77]I, the battery's like died or something.
[03:01.68]I don't know.

[03:06.60]Uh, he's transforming.
[03:08.44]No, and the shelf is right there too.
[03:11.18]That was like in part, and I got like a fucking suit on.
[03:21.87]Anyways, uh, we've got the Rumble to do.

[03:32.96]Before we even get started, I gotta thank a few people.
[03:36.94]I gotta thank CrowSkiNail, LeatherJacket, VR Josh, CADBTTV, GrumpClump, and all the other mods.
[03:46.63]Without their help, this stream does not happen.
[03:51.23]Like, without their help at all.
[03:52.47]It just, this physically would not happen, so.
[03:55.43]They worked on characters.
[03:56.85]They helped with, like, the poll and shit.
[03:59.43]Like, this doesn't happen unless they helped.
[04:02.17]So, please give them a round of fucking applause.
[04:08.06]The stream isn't loading.
[04:10.02]What?
[04:11.94]Ban them all.

[04:33.98]Whatever.
[04:35.74]So we can get started.
[04:36.64]I mean, actually no.
[04:37.46]Let's just wait.
[04:38.77]Let's just wait.
[04:43.09]Can you pog?
[04:43.79]Is that good enough?

[04:56.87]Gonna be this one.
[05:00.91]Best new character.
[05:02.21]That's the first.
[05:02.87]We're not doing it yet.
[05:03.79]Hold on, I'm gonna milk this.
[05:07.46]Not really flashy this year.
[05:09.54]These are just on security envelopes.
[05:13.30]Written in crayon.
[05:14.38]And I spelt it wrong.
[05:20.20]Off to a great start.
[05:25.82]All right, listen to me.
[05:28.12]I'm drinking a CBD drink, all right?
[05:29.96]It's CBD THC.
[05:35.95]Me and alcohol, I don't want any alcohol.
[05:39.29]I spelled character wrong, but I knew it.
[05:41.67]I didn't even care because I didn't want to make a new envelope.
[05:44.43]So I was just like, whatever.
[05:45.09]I don't want to cross that out.
[05:46.05]I don't care.
[05:46.45]It doesn't matter.
[05:50.36]People are giving a shitload of subs.
[05:52.64]What do we got here?
[05:57.29]Oh, and also Superdaza.
[05:59.25]Making fucking all these videos.
[06:01.14]It's a shitload of videos.
[06:01.88]It's like 19 videos.
[06:03.32]So, unbelievable work.
[06:09.74]We had 10 community subs from Lexis.
[06:11.48]5 from Castax.
[06:13.26]5 from Holeof1Zombie.
[06:16.30]$50.
[06:16.64]$50.
[06:17.76]From... Am I... I'm a 10k Andy now?
[06:23.47]Yeah.
[06:24.15]Whatever.
[06:26.59]No, I want to do the thing.
[06:30.43]$50 hair.
[06:31.89]I put a little gel in it today.
[06:33.00]That's a lie, I didn't.
[06:35.30]There's so many community subs coming in.
[06:36.82]I don't know what to do.
[06:38.60]Thank you for the insane amount of support.
[06:41.60]Completely unnecessary.
[06:43.24]Don't have to do this.
[06:44.48]You guys give me fucking trillions of dollars.
[06:48.28]With an asterisk.
[06:49.34]There's an asterisk on that because it's not actually trillions.
[06:51.92]But, you know, as an asterisk, it's actually like, it's not that much.
[06:55.46]But it is a lot.
[06:56.58]It's not over a trillion, though.
[06:58.34]If it was, I would buy a fucking island and make videos on it.
[07:04.55]You're the richest streamer on Twitch.
[07:06.01]That's not true.
[07:10.42]Well, I'm going to need to pay off that debt somehow.
[07:14.02]I don't like this.
[07:15.75]I don't like where this is.
[07:16.55]I'm moving it.
[07:20.43]I don't like where that is.
[07:21.21]It's going to keep hitting my CBD drink.
[07:27.42]I don't like this.
[07:30.14]It's going to keep bumping into my drink.
[07:33.94]Whatever.
[07:35.90]I'll put the drink over here.
[07:37.44]Yeah, that makes sense.
[07:38.04]Let's fill it up.
[07:41.77]Drinking bong water.
[07:45.39]All right.
[07:45.79]So you want to know how this is going to work?
[07:47.89]This is how this is going to work.
[07:49.87]We're going to do four categories, and then we're going to do a match in the rumble.
[07:55.77]After a match, we're going to do four categories, match, four categories, match, four categories, match, and we'll be done.
[08:02.79]So you ready?
[08:05.86]Have we all joined?
[08:06.66]Is everybody here and accounted for?
[08:11.76]Everybody pogging?
[08:13.82]Getting lots of pogs?
[08:15.68]Thank you for the insane community subs, guys.
[08:17.78]I don't even know where to start.
[08:19.10]Thank you.
[08:21.36]You ready?
[08:23.24]Well, if we're ready, I gotta put my headphones in.

[08:30.67]Let's go, they said.
[08:31.75]You can't even hear that.
[08:34.19]Let's go, they said.
[08:37.59]And the winner of Best New Character... I didn't even show the nominees yet.

[09:11.60]The cow's name, by the way, is Murius.
[09:13.18]If you were not part of the freestream chat.
[09:16.48]This is psycho.
[09:38.52]Oh my god, what is he doing?
[09:41.95]And unfortunately, the voice actor from Frog Detective 1 did not move on to Frog Detective 2.
[09:48.61]He was in the middle of other projects.
[09:50.65]Alright, you want me to mute his sections?
[09:52.35]Hold on.
[09:53.85]I know that voice actor.
[09:55.13]You want me to call him?
[09:57.41]Come on.

[10:02.25]Hey, what's up?
[10:03.09]It's me.
[10:04.19]Oh, hey.
[10:04.49]What's going on?
[10:05.03]How are you doing?
[10:06.11]I'm doing good.
[10:06.61]Did you get my messages that I sent you?
[10:08.46]Yes, I did.
[10:10.75]Mr. Green is more like it.
[10:12.87]That's me.
[10:16.77]I am invincible.
[10:18.57]I am untouchable.
[10:22.01]No one can fuck with Mr. Green.
[10:24.80]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[10:27.28]I just puked a shot out of my mouth.
[10:32.50]Steve?
[10:34.16]Yes, Mr. Green?
[10:34.92]Give me another T-shirt.
[10:36.82]Oh, my God.
[10:40.58]Yeah, and when you guys come back, remember, it's me, the fat fuck IRL.
[10:47.22]Come back next week and I'll shake my stomach around for you boy after drinking three Gatorades.

[11:03.98]Hope you're all ready.
[11:05.74]Same guy, just one of them's drunker.
[11:20.23]Oh, you want some DMT, dude?
[11:26.17]Alright, you got it!
[11:28.45]I'll take some right now.
[11:29.81]Holy shit.
[11:32.12]Holy shit.
[11:33.46]I think the clerk at my local Walmart is actually Jesus Reborn.
[11:38.08]And here are 200 reasons why.
[11:43.29]Hey, whoa, man, whoa, man, you gotta settle down on DMT.
[11:46.86]Like, I'm asking because like a friend of mine asked me one day, like yesterday, he said, hey, dude, what's the button combination if you have like a computer and you have a program on your computer that emulates video games?
[12:00.49]He's like, hey, what's a button combination to save a state?
[12:02.95]And I was like, I don't fucking know.
[12:05.39]Leave me alone.
[12:06.29]Dave's pissed.
[12:06.95]Dave's like a wicked powerful senator.
[12:09.62]If I get this wrong, he'll, like, introduce a bill to remove my fucking stream.
[12:15.08]Hey, uh, Jeremy, I got really... My aspect ratio in Swordfish 1, 2 is going crazy.
[12:23.39]Fix it.
[12:24.99]Okay, I think four by three.
[12:26.85]I think that will help if you open up that program.
[12:28.83]Alright, I'll try.
[12:30.29]They're all just like, fuck.
[12:33.39]I spy with my little eye something that is orange.
[12:42.96]You got it.
[12:43.98]That's my son.
[12:44.76]He got it.
[12:45.22]It's the sky and everything else.
[12:47.42]You got it.
[12:48.84]Alright.
[12:49.90]Same guy four times.
[12:51.60]Okay.

[13:45.97]Mr. Green!
[13:47.43]Mr. Green at number one, with 50, almost 51% of the vote.
[13:52.53]Long Drive Dad was number two at 16.6% of the vote.
[13:57.33]And I got too lazy to write the third one on this one.
[13:59.76]It was the first one.
[14:01.10]Sorry about that.
[14:04.12]He destroyed it, but they're all the same fucking character.
[14:07.48]They're all the same character.
[14:10.64]And you know what?
[14:11.42]Hearing it and seeing it while I'm sitting here...

[14:19.37]Hey, how you doing, everybody?
[14:21.17]That's me.
[14:21.85]Every character the German does, that's a little bit weird and might be a little fat.
[14:25.99]You know, if you gain some weight and you talk like this and you have like a beard, then all of a sudden you're like a bad guy.

[15:14.37]If you don't know what the cat puke is, a year or two ago, I think it was last year, I did a noise, and I kind of do a noise sometimes where I pretend to throw up in my mouth and swallow it really quickly.
[15:27.66]I've done it like probably 30 times in the last two years, and I don't know.
[15:32.61]I don't know why I do it.
[15:33.29]I just think it's funny.
[15:34.89]So here's a compilation.
[15:36.11]This is...
[15:38.58]This is the best one of this year, apparently.
[15:40.36]And I didn't even realize how many nominees were on this list.
[15:43.88]I do this too much.
[15:45.60]But I don't care.
[15:47.50]I'm going to continue to do it.
[15:48.44]So that's just the way it is.

[17:45.74]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best cat puke for 2020.
[17:50.40]Oh, I don't even know which one this was.
[17:51.93]I forgot already.
[17:53.63]It is...
[17:55.91]one more for the road from bug snacks at 20.09 of the vote underneath that is the water tank with the 15.5 and then underneath that one is trying to stop the water at 14.4.6 percent now you might be asking yourself why is that category on the list hey
[18:23.89]There ain't no worse Peter this year.
[18:26.43]I can say Peter as much as I want now.
[18:27.79]I can say Peter every... I can say it as much as I want.
[18:30.07]It's not even... It's not on the list.
[18:31.07]It wasn't a category.
[18:33.81]Replaced it with something even worse.
[18:34.89]Alright, this next one is... This next one is going to be very, very fun.
[18:42.05]For you.
[18:42.57]Not for me.
[18:44.13]Let's take a look at it now.
[18:44.83]What do you think?
[18:48.43]See?
[18:49.61]I'm a human.
[18:50.79]I'm a normal guy.
[18:53.03]This is what my hair looks like.
[18:55.13]Sometimes it doesn't look very good.
[18:57.77]Sometimes it looks awful.
[18:59.17]Sometimes it looks so bad that I'm embarrassed.
[19:02.92]And a lot of people keep track of these.
[19:06.62]And every year we try to find the worst case of bad hair that I've had for the entire year.
[19:13.75]And I think this year, out of all the years, I think this is the worst year ever for this category.
[19:21.16]I think there were so many good ones that this was tough.
[19:28.26]This was a tough one.
[19:30.62]Here are the nominees.
[19:32.54]Worst hair of the year.

[22:36.70]No, it didn't.
[22:37.38]Oh, I'm sorry.
[22:38.64]I am sorry, but 45... Look at this.
[22:43.36]Wait, what?
[22:45.48]Hey!
[22:51.12]That's so fucking bad, guys.
[22:53.71]Like, Hillary Clinton was... My career is over.
[22:57.21]My looks are over.
[22:58.03]Well, my career was over.
[22:59.05]My career was over right there.
[23:00.69]But I built it back.
[23:03.45]Uh...
[23:04.69]Yeah.
[23:05.47]There's no question.
[23:06.83]You look 60.
[23:07.31]I looked 600.
[23:09.35]Like I was mummified and they found me buried.
[23:11.47]In like a tomb somewhere.
[23:17.40]What's this next one?
[23:18.74]Oh, alright.
[23:19.18]So we're going to stay on this cat.
[23:21.28]We've got four?
[23:22.40]This is the fourth, right?
[23:25.06]Staying in the same realm of worst hair.
[23:27.66]We have worst face.
[23:28.96]And I held this up last year and it went like this.
[23:32.15]And people tried to nominate that, but I'm sorry, that was not even a bad face.
[23:36.79]So, we're gonna do- this is- we need real worst faces.
[23:40.24]And what is a worst face?
[23:41.08]If you don't- if you're new to the channel or something.
[23:43.52]Uh, well sometimes when I go like this.
[23:45.46]Like if I'm scared at a video game, or if something bad happens, or something scary, or something weird, or I- I'm losing my mind, and I- I go like this, like- like, you know what I mean?
[23:53.37]Or I like freak out, or like my- I cringe up and stuff.
[23:57.03]Uh, or it's just like somebody decides that I was ugly today, and they take a screenshot of me.
[24:03.39]You're in the nominees for worst face of the year.
[24:07.09]See you in a sec.
[24:37.87]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:42.09]Too big.
[24:42.97]Too big and too bright.
[24:43.85]Too big and too bright.
[24:44.81]Too big and too bright.
[24:45.63]That's the worst face 2020.
[24:55.62]Oh, yeah?
[24:56.96]You sure?
[24:57.32]How about now?
[25:15.46]That was pretty bad.
[25:17.88]No, is this weird?
[25:18.70]Is this gonna get, like, fucking weird?
[25:21.00]If I'm like... Not even that bad.
[25:32.60]This is what a toddler does when they know they did something wrong.
[25:40.21]That should be an emote.
[25:41.89]Stanley Kubrick!
[25:46.82]Kubrick's stare.
[25:57.66]It's fucking dark in here.
[25:59.81]So we were just sitting there and you're just spinning the thing around like, all right, we win.
[26:03.65]We did it.
[26:05.21]What?
[26:05.75]I mean, I don't know.
[26:11.35]Jeff.
[26:14.52]Oh my god!
[26:19.62]Boom!
[26:20.70]That's when I can't explode!
[26:25.74]Holy shit.
[26:26.42]Okay.
[26:33.58]So the winner of the worst face of the year category.
[26:37.69]This was a... It wasn't that close.
[26:40.47]It really wasn't that close.
[26:42.71]The winner...
[26:45.80]What do you think?
[26:49.77]What do you think?
[26:51.09]With 28.8% of the vote.
[26:56.53]Who's the Easy Bake Oven Pizza Face?
[27:01.96]Oven Pizza.
[27:02.58]Coming in next at 14.7% was the Kubrick Stare.
[27:06.98]And then the Wide Grin was for 10.2% of the vote.
[27:13.00]Goblin got snubbed.
[27:15.12]Pretty hard, yeah.
[27:18.84]I mean, the Easy Bake Oven pizza tea thing, it was revolting.
[27:23.04]It was disgusting.
[27:26.52]That was what lost by the most?
[27:29.16]I don't think that's fair to that nominee.
[27:32.58]I don't think that's fair to that nominee.
[27:35.46]And hey, time is it.
[27:38.88]We got a rumble.
[27:40.28]We've got multiple matches.
[27:43.49]Hopefully, 2K20 does not fuck up on us.
[27:48.00]I would be very disappointed if it does.
[27:50.48]But I'm ready to start the first match of the Rumble.
[27:53.96]We have five matches, including the Rumble.
[27:55.80]We're going to be starting with this one first.
[27:59.12]Just give me one second while I get it going, and we'll get it on.
[28:05.41]The first match of the Rumble is coming in.
[28:11.89]Hold on.
[28:12.19]I don't want to spoil it.
[28:13.55]I don't want to spoil it.
[28:16.87]I don't want to spoil it.
[28:18.69]Ow!
[28:22.06]I'm okay.
[28:24.54]You thought just the New Year's Eve Awards was the only thing we were doing here.
[28:27.66]Of course, we're going to do the Jerma Rumble live.
[28:33.60]In beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.
[28:36.15]Also where I've been standing.
[28:38.59]Tried to make an official Jerma arena.
[28:41.95]But the game crashed every time I tried to change the rope.
[28:45.29]Whoa!
[28:46.07]Don't want to spoil anything.
[28:49.85]The game crashed every time I changed the color of the ropes.
[28:52.70]I couldn't do my own arena.
[28:54.64]2K20 is horrible.
[28:57.76]Alright, you ready for the first match?
[28:59.50]I think a lot of you guys are going to have a lot riding on this one.
[29:04.55]You guys are going to have a lot riding on this one.
[29:07.65]This is a tornado tag match.
[29:11.93]And this is, it's going to get heated in the chat here.
[29:15.94]2v2.
[29:20.00]While it loads.
[29:21.98]We're going to have.
[29:23.94]Turn on predictions.
[29:24.96]Oh, shit.
[29:25.78]I'm not ready for that.
[29:26.90]I'm not ready for that.
[29:27.62]I'm not ready for that.
[29:28.84]I'm not ready for it.
[29:30.08]I'm not ready for it.
[29:31.12]I'm not ready for it.
[29:32.15]Is there any mods that can help me?
[29:33.43]I'm not ready for it.
[29:34.41]I don't know what to do.
[29:35.17]I'm not ready for it.
[29:37.33]Any mods that can help me?
[29:38.13]I'm not ready for it.
[29:38.65]I don't know what to do.
[29:41.29]I don't know what to do.
[29:43.58]Oh, fuck.
[29:44.74]Well, you demodded me.
[29:46.32]I'm sorry.
[29:48.20]No, I need to be... Hold on.
[29:54.72]Shit.
[29:58.67]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[30:00.35]Is that something that we can easily do?
[30:06.37]Can we easily do that?
[30:15.33]Yes, yes, yes.
[30:16.09]Can we?
[30:22.45]Mod, mod, mod, mod everyone.
[30:28.88]How come this is not loading?
[30:33.08]Tell us the characters in Discord.
[30:34.42]Tell us the characters.
[30:35.24]Oh, shit.
[30:35.94]Oh, my God.
[30:36.40]Oh, my God.
[30:36.94]Oh, my God.
[30:37.36]Good, good, good, good.
[30:37.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:45.28]Hold on.
[30:45.54]Hold on.
[30:45.80]Hold on.
[30:46.06]Hold on.
[30:50.00]There we go.
[30:56.39]All right.
[30:57.23]They have the first match.
[30:58.59]How come that can't... Why is this not loading?
[31:06.25]Wait.
[31:06.49]I didn't just like play the game, did I?
[31:11.81]I hope I'm not playing the game.
[31:15.83]The first match of the evening is gonna be a tag team match.
[31:18.47]Hey, I'm talking.
[31:19.31]I'm talking.
[31:24.17]They're all from New York.
[31:28.87]I'm gonna have to turn.
[31:33.34]It's gonna be Kiryu and Majima in a tag match versus two other characters.
[31:40.28]And by the way, this is a stipulation on this one.
[31:43.80]Stipulation on this one.
[31:46.32]Whoever wins this match gets another stream.
[31:49.87]Really important to mention.
[31:51.87]As Majima comes in.
[31:54.15]His tag partner will be coming in too.
[31:59.73]Kiryu, as you know, from Yakuza.
[32:01.78]Yakuza 0, to be exact.
[32:04.04]Gotta shut this guy up.
[32:06.22]Also from New York.
[32:07.06]Yeah, why does it say you suck?
[32:18.31]I think, by the way, I gave him Andre the Giant's entrance.
[32:22.45]That's why he's walking so slow.
[32:25.01]They're all from the Bronx.
[32:26.13]They're all from Brooklyn.
[32:31.34]I don't think we can even do the betting right now.
[32:33.06]I didn't set it up.
[32:34.02]It's all right.
[32:34.82]Do it later.
[32:35.82]Do it on betting.
[32:39.36]But who are they fighting against, though?
[32:40.32]That's important.
[32:42.86]Who are they going to fight against?
[32:43.78]Who would deserve another stream?
[32:45.24]What do you guys think?
[32:49.45]There are two characters I know that people really, really would love to see come back.
[32:53.91]It's not Bugsnax.
[32:57.63]Not Godhand.
[33:01.54]Not L.A.
[33:02.04]Noire.
[33:02.30]Two beloved characters.
[33:07.26]You see one of them right now.
[33:10.30]The lights have just turned off.
[33:13.65]Introducing for the second team of the Who Gets Another Scream match, it's Sam and Max.
[33:25.36]I know a lot of you guys got stuff riding on this.
[33:36.44]So who is going to win?
[33:37.38]This is Tornado Tag, by the way.
[33:38.52]They're in there at the same time.
[33:43.40]Wait, we got a prediction.
[33:46.28]Win channel points.
[33:47.12]Oh shit, we got it.
[33:48.92]Majima and Kira versus Sam and Max.
[33:51.55]Both desperately want to see their respective franchises continue.
[34:00.89]Get your channel points if you want to.
[34:04.01]Who do you think is going to win this match?
[34:05.79]Oh, what an entrance there.
[34:08.53]Flipping over the top rope.
[34:12.35]Just flying in.
[34:15.21]Taking his time with his bird feet.
[34:18.13]Used to be a dog.
[34:24.54]13, 14.8.
[34:25.94]To 11.
[34:28.58]Okay.
[34:31.26]Here comes Sam.
[34:32.68]I mean Max.
[34:33.26]Who's the bunny?
[34:35.62]I really hope I'm not controlling a character.
[34:37.28]Because I didn't set it up that way.
[34:42.60]Get your drinks going.
[34:45.29]Alcoholic or non-alcoholic.
[34:46.63]And here comes Max.
[34:48.67]They all just live in a high rise in New York.
[34:52.75]All of them.
[34:53.73]It's like 60 apartments.
[35:13.06]It's the Germa House, but I'm not in New York.
[35:18.96]I'm going to laugh so hard if I have to control a character because I'm going to be pissed because I'm going to have to restart it.
[35:23.10]He doesn't have a shirt on.
[35:33.97]Well, wait, he's a bunny, so he doesn't have a shirt on.
[35:37.39]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here comes the beginning of this match.
[35:39.49]We're going to have Sam and Max versus Kiryu.
[35:42.27]How do I say that name?
[35:45.02]I'm saying it so wrong.
[35:49.96]How does it... Kiryu.
[35:51.42]Okay, Kiryu.
[35:54.65]Kiryu and Majima versus Sam and Max.
[35:56.47]Again, the winner of this competition gets another stream.
[36:00.59]Tornado tag matchup.
[36:01.87]They all have health on the bottom.
[36:03.63]And here we go.
[36:05.09]Oh, right off the bat.
[36:06.49]Sam with a flying leg kick.
[36:09.35]Right into Majima's face.
[36:10.14]They're also huge.
[36:12.92]Look at the referee.
[36:16.42]Now, there are rules here.
[36:17.42]There are rules.
[36:25.05]This is not a hardcore match.
[36:26.91]Snap suplex by Majima onto Sam.
[36:28.55]Right on his back.
[36:29.85]And taunting is Kiryu.
[36:31.70]Which was a very, very bad idea.
[36:33.28]Which Max takes out of the ring.
[36:37.72]Kicks him completely out of the ring in one boot.
[36:40.18]Is he going to suplex him out of the ring?
[36:41.29]I'm not sure.
[36:41.75]No, he's going to throw him on the top rope.
[36:44.91]And knee him directly in his skull.
[36:48.51]Majima taking a little bit of punishment here.
[36:50.85]Kiryu comes back in and Max is absolutely destroying right now.
[36:57.39]I don't think Max has taken one punch.
[37:00.73]Sam has though.
[37:05.32]Nice dodge by Max with the reversal into the triple shin kick.
[37:10.18]He's going for the pin.
[37:12.76]No way.
[37:13.36]It's way too early for that.
[37:18.98]Wait, did he just hit his head?
[37:22.68]Now you would think that Hurricane Rana.
[37:25.86]That's a good reversal there from Kiryu.
[37:29.00]Max now in a little bit of trouble on the outside of the ropes here while Sam and Majima are still outside.
[37:33.15]And I think Sam has just thrown Majima back and forth three or four times.
[37:39.83]Why is there nobody here?
[37:43.53]Why is there nobody in the audience?
[37:44.75]There's nobody here.
[37:46.71]This event is like...
[37:52.94]Max is carrying.
[37:54.77]I think, I want to turn the, I want to turn the HUD off.
[37:56.85]I don't want to see the information.
[37:59.13]Looks like he reset her for a powerbomb, maybe.
[38:01.19]No, he just let him go.
[38:03.15]He let him go.
[38:03.99]He keeps taunting.
[38:06.07]Now, what I was going to say earlier is you would think that Sam and Max would have the disadvantage here because they're not really fighters.
[38:15.21]They're more investigators, detectives.
[38:17.49]Although Sam does have a gun.
[38:20.89]high suplex there by sam out of ajima I'll carry you working that skull cap of max ajima looks like he's in a lot of trouble max isn't a lot of trouble too though setting up here looks like onto the top rope no well he's trying to think about what he wants to do with him he's going to throw about side of the ring nope just hit his face on that corner turnbuckle both of them want to see another stream so badly
[38:47.13]Is Sam going to submit here?
[38:48.95]We might see a submit.
[38:49.69]No.
[38:50.23]Reversal.
[38:50.73]Punching him a couple of times in the face.
[38:52.26]Right in the nose.
[38:52.96]And then getting on top of him.
[38:53.90]Doing a little twisty.
[38:55.36]Turny.
[38:55.76]Canrana.
[38:58.90]A lot of reversals.
[39:03.44]If you take a look at the health bars down there.
[39:04.88]You get to see Max is in a lot of trouble.
[39:06.70]Big DDT.
[39:10.42]Doing a lot of taunting.
[39:12.70]We see from Kiryu and Majima.
[39:15.56]This does not look good for Sam and Max right now.
[39:22.08]Big neck breaker, although Kira's bringing him over into the corner here.
[39:24.98]I'm not sure what his plan is.
[39:28.76]Max blew all of his energy in the first 30 seconds of the match.
[39:33.02]And he is almost toast.
[39:36.84]What?
[39:39.99]Why did he fall down?
[39:40.85]Are they going to set up a double team move?
[39:46.74]I heard a crunch!
[39:49.57]One, two!
[39:50.57]That's it!
[39:52.05]That's it!
[39:52.81]Kiryu and Majima win the first match of the evening!
[39:56.29]Oh my god!
[40:01.48]He just broke every bone in his body!
[40:06.86]When did he give him the stunner?
[40:14.71]Congratulations to Kiryu and Majima.
[40:17.49]Yakuza 0 is going to get another stream.
[40:22.67]We will see another stream from Kiryu and Majima.
[40:24.79]Sorry, Sam and Max.
[40:26.49]Max, I think, is dead.
[40:34.20]Oh, man.
[40:36.58]I heard a bunch of bones break.
[40:41.14]He weighs so much.
[40:42.58]Kiryu is like a 200 plus pound man.
[40:46.42]And Max is a bunny rabbit.
[40:50.08]He weighs like fucking four pounds.
[40:53.00]That was horrible.
[40:56.48]Okay.
[40:59.23]Well, we can move on to the next match in a minute here.
[41:03.73]We're going to do a couple more categories.
[41:04.83]That was the first match of the evening.
[41:07.73]I'm going to turn this off.
[41:08.67]We're going to keep this right here.
[41:11.81]And I just like, I blew schnoz out of my nose when he landed on him.
[41:15.35]I really did.
[41:15.77]I like blew my nose like hard.
[41:17.17]I don't want to, don't wipe it on the, I don't want to wipe it on the jacket.
[41:20.39]Hold on.
[41:20.73]What do I do?
[41:24.48]38.7 million have been traded hands here.
[41:26.76]Congratulations to those that have bet.
[41:27.94]All right, hold on a minute.
[41:29.86]I can't turn the camera on too late.
[41:31.00]I could, oh, here we go.
[41:31.78]This is an African writer.
[41:35.08]I brought this up for a very specific reason.
[41:41.34]Is it his hair grease?
[41:43.14]Oh my god, you're disgusting.
[41:45.60]Alright, let's get back to it.
[41:49.32]Hi.
[41:50.88]Thank you to the mods, by the way, that kind of jumped in there and fixed that up.
[41:56.16]Are you guys ready?
[41:56.90]Oh, I have to do this real quick.
[41:58.64]Hold on.
[42:01.84]We're going to do the next category.
[42:04.79]Reddit shelf, that's right.
[42:07.17]I need to open the mixer.
[42:10.17]There we go.
[42:10.71]Okay.
[42:11.91]Alright, coming up the next category, the next two in a row actually, uh, for the awards, are, uh, singing.
[42:18.94]So, some of the best singing, some of the worst singing.
[42:20.94]We're gonna start with the worst singing.
[42:22.72]What did you say?
[42:25.12]I lost all my money.
[42:26.24]You got villain hair tonight?
[42:29.02]Do I?
[42:29.30]I don't think it's villain hair right now.
[42:33.10]It has to be, like, slicked back.
[42:35.02]Dude, I... That fucking crunch.
[42:44.01]I'm going to need a second.
[42:48.99]Protagonist hair?
[42:53.76]Whatever.
[42:54.56]It's getting hot in this room too.
[42:56.04]I'm going to have to take this jacket off in like 10 minutes.
[42:59.60]Alright, so we're singing here with the nominees for the worst singing.
[43:01.64]Sometimes I decide to go into some song.
[43:04.86]And sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad.
[43:08.29]The worst part about these categories is pay attention because it really doesn't matter which one is worst and which one is best.
[43:17.12]It could be just flip them to any category you want.
[43:19.91]It's all just kind of bad.
[43:21.67]So here are the nominees for worst singing of the year.
[43:26.81]This is worst singing.
[43:28.95]Keep that in mind.
[43:38.76]That wasn't funny.
[43:56.65]Oh, boating is now finished, but there's still something on the wish list to keep us all going through the wind and the rain.
[44:05.19]There's no food on the table, there's wind still and there's a table, so we ain't going nowhere till we get some rain.
[44:15.34]That's bad.
[44:15.78]That was good.
[44:16.26]I don't know the lyrics.
[44:18.57]That was good.
[44:19.51]That was so loud.
[44:20.37]I'm sorry.
[44:21.25]What the fuck?
[44:38.89]And the home of the... ...Prince!
[45:08.41]Oh, at what point in this game do I go?
[45:10.09]What does that happen?
[45:12.69]Thank you for the rate.
[45:14.83]Really appreciate it.
[45:16.07]I am so happy.
[45:35.16]There's a hair on the fly in the water in the frog.
[45:44.91]There's a... There's a hair... There's a hair on the fly in the... There's a hair on the fly in the water in the leg of the frog in the bottom of the sea.
[45:54.08]There's a hair on the fly in the water in the frog in the log.
[45:57.16]Fuck!
[45:58.60]Hey, I know you're new.
[45:59.82]Welcome to the stream.
[46:01.79]Pull up a chair.
[46:03.11]It's quite the dream.
[46:05.39]It's your first time here?
[46:07.05]Oh, what a joy!
[46:09.64]But don't act like the stream is a toy.
[46:12.73]Oh, that was the worst one.
[46:14.30]I'm the bride.
[46:15.56]Just open minds.
[46:20.24]Just open minds.
[46:23.96]Like the 4th of July.
[46:26.94]Because, baby, you're a firework.
[46:31.44]Madam, show him.
[46:33.10]Ow.
[46:33.95]Put the Kingdom Hearts music back on.
[46:35.29]Oh, man.
[46:35.63]This morning.
[46:45.30]I can't.
[46:53.03]My voice is still fucked up.
[46:55.19]I can't do it.
[47:02.19]I'll tell you.
[47:04.73]I'm a little irritated with this one.
[47:06.09]A little irritated with this one.
[47:07.23]I don't know why this was so bad.
[47:09.69]I don't know why this one was considered to be so awful.
[47:12.18]Slightly irritated by this one.
[47:15.12]The winner of the worst singing of the year... Dame Dame with 18.5% of the vote.
[47:33.33]What was so wrong with that?
[47:36.91]Dame yo, dame, dame yo.
[47:40.61]What was wrong?
[47:42.81]The Raid song was in second place with 14.5% of the vote.
[47:48.04]And then the Yoshi Happy song was at 13.2% of the vote.
[47:51.30]There are your top three.
[47:54.28]The Raid song was like four seconds long.
[47:57.50]I guess it means that's why it was the worst.
[48:01.56]Just like we do the worst.
[48:03.00]We're also going to do the best.
[48:05.37]Is it too connected here?
[48:10.32]Yoshi was good.
[48:12.36]Um, but we're in the best now.
[48:14.58]We'll find out what really was the best.
[48:15.68]I'm just going to peek.
[48:16.78]I mean, I peeked.
[48:19.78]Why does it matter if I peeked?
[48:21.97]I wrote it down.
[48:22.75]I'm the person who wrote the, it's my handwriting.
[48:31.15]All right.
[48:31.65]Uh, coming up, we got the best singing.
[48:32.97]Here we go.
[48:33.49]Here come the nominees for best singing of the year.
[48:40.78]Aren't you prepared?
[48:50.08]I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side.
[48:52.86]And the hot stays hot.
[48:54.92]The new McDLT.
[48:56.14]Hot, hot.
[48:57.16]Crisp lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side.
[48:59.62]And the cool stays cool.
[49:01.56]The new McDLT.
[49:03.16]Cool crisp.
[49:03.96]The hot stays hot.
[49:05.20]The cool stays crisp.
[49:06.52]Put it together, you can't reason.
[49:10.31]My axe and my bow and my axe and my bow and my bow.
[49:15.57]It's not even here.
[49:16.41]Audio jungle.
[49:34.05]Audio jungle.
[49:35.03]Oh, this is my favorite part.
[49:37.11]I love this part.
[49:37.79]Coming up here.
[49:38.33]Oh, that's my favorite part.
[49:43.55]I love it.

[49:56.31]Breaking.
[49:56.79]Breaking.
[49:57.03]Breaking.
[49:57.25]Breaking.
[49:57.73]Breaking.
[49:57.97]Breaking.
[50:04.94]Hello, my love.
[50:07.65]I am here to have some fun with you and me.
[50:15.25]We'll see our destiny while we're in love.
[50:20.64]It's me, the comedy guy.
[50:22.84]Hey, look at that bitch.
[50:24.60]Excuse me, where are you going?
[50:26.06]Hey, don't hold up for me.
[50:29.17]It's me, the comedy horror guy.
[50:31.03]I just make fucking jokes while I'm scared.
[50:33.67]It's me, the comedy guy.
[50:35.22]I'm ruining your fucking enjoyment of my playthrough.
[50:39.39]Shine the bright.
[50:43.05]Just open minds.
[50:46.03]Just open minds.
[50:50.58]Like the 4th of July.
[50:53.84]Cause baby you're a firework.
[50:56.80]Made of joy.
[50:59.78]Ow.
[51:01.44]Yummy.
[51:02.00]Delicious.
[51:02.47]Banana.
[51:03.17]I can't wait to eat.
[51:04.61]Okay.
[51:05.17]Where do I find a car?
[51:07.86]I just love delicious banana.
[51:10.56]What the fuck?
[51:11.81]That was good.
[51:37.48]So, yeah, of course, Firework is on both best and worst singing.
[51:42.10]I guess I hit some of those notes, but the end was really bad.
[51:46.01]And I really sounded kind of like a horn with no air left in it.
[51:51.89]So, I mean, it could have been both.
[51:54.61]But, you know, we'll see.
[51:56.41]We'll see what the people have voted for.
[51:58.35]The winner of best singing of the entire year goes to... You probably could guess it at one pious shitload.
[52:08.07]Ah-ee-oo.
[52:10.75]Ah-ee-oo.
[52:13.07]Oh my god.
[52:13.78]Ah-ee-oo.
[52:15.02]Oh my, that's not even good.
[52:16.76]Ah-ee-oo.
[52:29.80]Ah-ee-oo.
[52:31.70]Ah-ee-oo.
[52:33.29]It won.
[52:34.49]It won by... It won 53% of the vote.
[52:39.63]More than half of you guys voted for that.
[52:42.60]Underneath that, at 15.4%, so you gotta go really far down, was the McDLT song.
[52:50.08]And then at number 3 was Firework at 7.6% of the vote.
[52:52.16]53% of you voted for it.
[53:02.05]uh what's next we got a couple more to do right uh this is one of my favorite categories that has been added this is uh best one guy moment and best one guy moment has turned into one of my favorite things on this stream it's when somebody one of you is able to be to derail the entire stream and com and almost sometimes change everything we're doing by a simple comment or something that you have said uh so
[53:31.04]Here are the nominees, and I think there are a lot of them, for the best one guy moment of the year.
[53:54.51]Seriously, what does this have to do with anything?
[53:57.61]What does this have to do with anything?
[54:03.42]What does this have to do with anything?
[54:05.38]What does this have to do with anything?
[54:14.06]You put the dough in the pan and then put the pan in the oven.
[54:18.96]Yeah, I bet your bread is real gross.
[54:21.05]We gotta do a public apology?
[54:26.29]So, a lot of you may have...
[54:30.05]Been aware of some of the things that I may have said on stream recently.
[54:36.13]I really don't mean that.
[54:38.56]I didn't mean that at all.
[54:40.16]And yeah, I just kind of want to go back to the kind of way it was beforehand.
[54:49.54]And I'm very sorry.
[54:53.81]New offer.
[54:54.51]Read to us green eggs and ham without fucking up once.
[54:57.11]Remove 75 million.
[54:59.55]Did somebody just make this account and start broadcasting and then screencap it or fake it?
[55:05.61]Or is this the real account?
[55:07.33]That's real?
[55:27.84]Chuck E. Cheese is here.
[55:30.84]What is Chuck E. Cheese doing here?
[55:32.22]What did you guys do?
[55:33.28]Why'd you do this?
[55:38.67]It says high germa in the thing, but... It's because you gave him ten... You gave him ten dollars to do that!
[55:46.25]You literally won't get past the first part of Fellowship, I guarantee it.
[55:49.28]I wouldn't...
[55:52.84]Alright, I want to remember your name, because when I get past level 1 in Fellowship of the Ring, I'm going to fucking scream your name.
[55:59.75]God damn it.
[56:01.45]I can't let this person be right.
[56:06.11]I guarantee... I guarantee you're not going to get through the first part of Fellowship of the Ring for PlayStation 2.
[56:15.40]I guarantee it.
[56:17.24]Fucking... They can't be right.
[56:19.68]They can't be right.
[56:20.72]They can't be right.
[56:27.43]I saw, I just saw in the chat, the funniest thing I've seen all week.
[56:30.71]The funniest thing I've seen all week, absolutely, without a doubt, in like the last five plus fucking streams.
[56:37.59]The funniest thing I've seen all week.
[56:39.17]You ready?
[56:40.13]They said Olive Garden music.
[56:44.49]That's perfect.
[56:45.27]That's fucking perfect.
[56:48.91]Smarties and Tootsie Rolls from like 1993.
[56:54.64]Smarties are great.
[56:55.60]Up your urethra.
[56:58.00]Why did I read that?
[57:00.22]I, Jeremy Albertson, will not make any reference to The Binding of Isaac, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Dark Souls during this stream.
[57:11.18]If I do, I will gift five community subs per reference.
[57:16.03]Fury vanquished.
[57:19.57]Have you seen you?
[57:22.23]Have you seen you?
[57:24.35]Five subs.
[57:29.84]There's one, there's a second stream right now, it's gone, and the title is High Germo.
[57:34.05]You got 13.2 clicks per second.
[57:35.97]He's also cheating.
[57:37.07]Like, you're also cheating.
[57:39.63]Like, you can go download an auto-clicker and have it just click.
[57:44.88]This is the fucking way you do 13.2.
[57:51.34]Ah, I fucking lost it.
[57:56.58]I gotta be 13.2.
[57:57.74]I can't let this guy be a better streamer than me.
[57:59.61]I can't.
[58:05.47]Somebody said, why was he so out of breath?
[58:07.51]Do you understand how much energy it takes to click that fast with your finger?
[58:14.45]To be able to do the rapid, like 16 or like 20, it's between 16 to 25 clicks per second, depending on the day.
[58:22.57]You use so much energy to go like this.
[58:33.48]takes a lot okay um with 62 percent of the votes 62.5 percent it's just not even fair it should have been in its own like category it should have just been like we should have just omitted it it was it's thicker like with 62.5 percent of the vote it spawned a lot of shit
[59:01.84]Right underneath that, you gotta, well, you gotta go pretty far.
[59:04.75]You gotta go down to, with 11.8% of the vote, Chuck E. Cheese's appearance.
[59:10.76]I mean, that was, that was pretty, that was pretty wild.
[59:18.15]Chuck E. Cheese's appearance had... I mean, he raided me.
[59:21.36]He, like, hosted me.
[59:22.22]And, like, somebody linked a picture of me kissing him.
[59:24.82]I mean, like, that... It was a wild stream.
[59:28.50]And then Smarties are great up your... Somewhere.
[59:33.52]With 7.2% of the vote.
[59:35.25]But it wasn't even fair.
[59:36.81]It just... It seriously wasn't even fair.
[59:41.77]Lord of the Rings got robbed.
[59:44.91]Snubs.
[59:45.91]Snubs all over the place.
[59:48.61]Not photoshopped.
[59:49.41]I mean, it could have been.
[59:53.33]We're going to do actually two more.
[59:54.91]Because I feel like these need to be back-to-back before we do the next match.
[59:58.65]So... Oh, yeah.
[60:02.31]Coming up next are worst impression and best impression.
[60:08.42]Again, these categories, I could go like this.
[60:14.46]And open it, and you wouldn't even know which one it was.
[60:17.54]So, we'll do worst impression first.
[60:22.62]Here comes the nominees for worst impressions of the year.
[60:28.12]I still can't get over that four-voice Andy in the beginning of this stream.
[60:33.90]There are 21,000 people here.
[60:37.43]What's up?
[60:44.81]Welcome.
[60:45.13]Hope you're having a good time.
[60:47.11]It's an award show.
[60:48.75]And it's a rumble.
[60:49.37]You're going to see that too soon.
[60:54.01]CBD.
[60:54.23]All right, here are the nominees for worst impression of the year.
[60:59.38]Whatever.
[61:14.47]I don't understand why you're an idiot and I'm going to throw this thing on the floor and it's going to explode.
[61:23.12]And I don't know what you're talking about, man.
[61:25.96]I think you need to shut your mouth.
[61:28.04]The little guy has a mouth on him, I think.
[61:31.28]That's too bad.
[61:35.61]What's going on in here?
[61:36.97]I can't do Frylock.
[61:37.89]Okay, all of them at once.
[61:40.31]So we got Marge.

[62:08.79]He did.
[62:09.75]He stole so many things from Jim Gaffigan.
[62:12.91]I didn't steal anything.
[62:15.83]Oh, that's just, that's baloney.
[62:20.58]If anything, I have all my material completely not made.
[62:24.52]It's all mine.
[62:27.42]He really thinks that, doesn't he?
[62:30.64]D.Va is Elmo.
[62:33.59]Is Gollum.
[62:35.91]We want shit.
[62:36.95]We need shit.

[62:39.99]It's also one of the Ed Brothers.
[62:41.71]It could be anyone, Eddie.
[62:44.13]It could even be Elmo.
[62:46.41]The third graders can speak?
[62:48.23]Do they talk like this?
[62:51.74]Have you ever heard a third grader talk?
[62:54.26]They talk like... Can I have some of that, please?
[62:58.42]I'll take... They don't all talk like that.
[62:59.98]What?

[63:39.59]Hey, Rick.
[63:40.74]Hey, Morty.
[63:42.56]Oh, what is it, Rick?
[63:43.80]I turned myself into a green screen.
[63:47.54]Oh, no.
[63:49.84]Morty, you can be whatever you want in front of the green screen.
[63:54.17]I don't want to be you, Rick.
[63:55.87]Morty, get over there and be me.
[63:58.03]No, I don't want to, Morty.
[64:01.18]Tommy Wiseau.
[64:03.66]Who's in that room?
[64:07.88]Probably me in that chair.
[64:11.11]Oh, that was not good.
[64:13.01]That was bad.
[64:18.64]Stop playing that!
[64:20.08]Why does it keep doing that?
[64:21.32]It wants to play one guy moment so bad over and over again.
[64:25.99]Baby Bop is in almost every bad category.
[64:28.99]Worst noise, worst singing, was it in best singing too?
[64:31.93]Why is Baby Bop in every category?
[64:37.23]So, I have to say something about this winner.
[64:40.06]This is just proof to me that I need to stop doing
[64:59.75]any of the Simpsons ever again for the rest of my life.
[65:02.13]I'm never doing a Simpsons impression.
[65:04.73]All of the Simpsons at once won by, it was 31% of the vote.
[65:12.10]It's going to be on here every single year.
[65:14.56]It's been on here every single year.
[65:15.88]If I do Homer, even for a second, even for one goddamn second, it's on here.
[65:22.98]If I do Lisa or Marge, it's on here every single year.
[65:28.20]Try Homer now.
[65:29.00]No, it'll be on here.
[65:30.68]No, the best part about this stream is like a bunch of you guys forget the fucked up shit I'm going to do tonight.
[65:35.19]You know what I mean?
[65:37.31]And it's tech.
[65:38.25]Wait.
[65:38.99]And here's the next best part about this stream.
[65:41.35]It ain't even January yet.
[65:43.07]So I can do whatever I want on these award streams.
[65:47.78]So it's the last day.
[65:48.92]You can't even nominate this.
[65:50.16]It's lost forever.
[65:50.98]It's lost in a void.
[65:54.04]So, all right, here we go.
[65:56.37]Hey, hey Bart, it's me.
[65:59.17]Ooh, that's what I look like when I do that?
[66:00.65]Uh, in second place was Rick and Morty Greenscreen with 11.4%.
[66:06.07]And, and then a cow at 10.7%.
[66:09.93]I could understand the cow one, and I could understand the Simpsons one.
[66:15.04]But the Rick and Morty Greenscreen one I thought was like kind of good.
[66:17.34]I like thought I did a good job.
[66:21.04]Sometimes you think things that are not right.
[66:25.59]It's January here.
[66:26.29]Wait, what time is it right now?
[66:27.27]9... It's 9.30.
[66:30.83]Okay, it's 9.30 right now.
[66:36.28]We're dropping it on Eastern time.
[66:41.06]6.30 my time, but it's 9.30 Eastern.
[66:43.42]We have two and a half hours.
[66:44.72]Okay.
[66:46.38]So just like the bad ones, there are also the good ones too.
[66:50.02]This is best impression of the year.
[66:52.86]Actually, what...
[67:01.78]Otto?
[67:03.12]Is he right there?
[67:07.32]Joe Otto.
[67:07.88]He's right there.
[67:08.60]He's sleeping.
[67:09.08]I'm not going to go wake him up just to get him on camera.
[67:12.76]Okay, what if somebody walked into your bedroom and fucking just opened the cupboard and was like, hey, hey, come over here.
[67:20.43]What's going on?
[67:22.41]Look, hey.
[67:23.85]Hey, what's up?
[67:24.33]Hey, look at the camera.
[67:26.05]What the fuck are you doing here?
[67:31.02]I don't want to do that.
[67:33.15]Like, he's sleeping.
[67:34.19]He's having, like, a nice rest.
[67:35.71]I don't want to, like, go disturb him.
[67:38.99]Just rotate the camera.
[67:41.23]He's under the blanket, though.
[67:42.16]You can't see him.
[67:43.64]Alright, here come the nominees for best impression of the year.
[67:48.02]Let's see if your favorite got selected.
[67:50.68]Let's see if your favorite got fucking selected.
[67:56.90]Press the right button, Jeremy.
[67:58.04]Don't press the one guy one again.
[68:00.54]Here we go.
[68:09.74]I don't want to do that, Mr. Turtle!
[68:11.40]I don't want to see that!
[68:12.48]And I don't want you to come into my house!
[68:14.32]Okay, game on.
[68:16.38]Okay, acting challenge.
[68:17.90]R2-D2 dying.
[68:19.00]Easy.
[68:24.37]There's a storm.
[68:26.27]It's not raining yet.
[68:29.91]Besides, it's not actually that unsafe to swim in the storm.
[68:35.19]Everyone keeps telling me to get out of the sea.
[68:39.70]But it's safer in here than it is up there.
[68:43.01]Uh, Bernie, how would you like to respond to that?
[68:46.91]I just want to say that I think that answer was cringe.
[68:52.13]The following has encouragement.
[68:54.68]That's what it is.
[68:55.58]It's a bunch of compress.
[68:58.04]The following has encouragement and love.
[69:04.98]We want to thank you for being here.
[69:09.76]You're the one that gets things done around here.
[69:17.08]Well, tell him.
[69:19.08]A great job.
[69:22.90]Like, I think that we can maybe get some quality entertainment here, Scoob.
[69:30.57]Like, maybe we should stop streaming, Scoob.
[69:36.03]I think maybe that's a good idea.
[69:37.47]Yes.
[69:45.57]Now, now, let me tell you about the stimulus.
[69:52.36]We are not ready to move forward on a stimulus.
[69:58.10]Not yet.
[69:58.96]Maybe soon we will move forward on that.
[70:01.40]But, Madam Speaker, I...
[70:11.79]Tell me everything you know.
[70:15.32]Like a parakeet.
[70:22.16]Yeah, it makes sense, right?
[70:25.25]Look at half of my mannerisms.
[70:26.59]Just like... Step on me.
[70:29.69]Step on me more.
[70:42.69]a steady diet of like captain crunch and bologna that's how you end up like that uh the winner of best impression of the year is
[71:10.40]R2-D2 dying sound with 34% of the vote.
[71:15.72]Second is Bernie Sanders with 18%.
[71:18.63]And then rounding us off at the end at number three was Mitch McConnell at 12.7.
[71:22.21]Mitch McConnell.
[71:26.53]Mitch McConnell.
[71:32.72]Mitch McConnell.
[71:48.85]Coming up next, we have... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[71:50.72]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[71:52.00]We're done.
[71:52.44]We're done.
[71:52.72]We're done.
[71:53.26]We're done.
[71:54.30]We're gonna do a match.
[71:57.36]Political.
[72:00.60]How's that political?
[72:02.69]Mitch McConnell right now is, like, more hated than the Joker is in Gotham City in the fucking DC universe.
[72:12.56]Really?
[72:20.71]Is that politics?
[72:23.56]It's still political.
[72:25.72]Yeah, whatever.
[72:29.32]It's the CBD coming out.
[72:30.66]It sure is.
[72:34.62]I promise I'm not pissing.
[72:37.51]My noise gate probably didn't even pick it up.
[72:40.65]By the way, somebody said CBD is unregulated.
[72:42.57]Okay, and bananas have radioactive poison in them.
[72:46.37]Whatever.
[72:46.65]Whatever.
[72:49.96]uh we're gonna do the next match of the rumble and make sure I get it I gotta hold on let me turn this off for a sec let me just let me let me see if I can make sure that I I don't want I want the hud be gone I don't want a hud yeah uh I I know I know we're gonna do the betting this is gonna be the second match of the evening and this one is gonna be very fun it might even be funny too
[73:22.45]Let me just give the mods who it is.
[73:28.17]So they can do the prediction.
[73:28.97]Uh, I can remember... Hold on.
[73:34.57]I can't remember the names.
[73:36.31]I don't remember the names.
[73:40.11]Wait, can you only do... Wait, you can only do one.
[73:44.53]This is a three-way extreme rules match.
[73:46.67]I'm not sure we can predict this one.
[73:50.58]Yeah, we can't do the predictions on this one.
[73:52.54]You can only do two.
[73:56.28]It's only two.
[73:58.00]Yeah, it's a three-way.
[74:05.70]It will... Oh, when there are only two left, well, whoever pins wins.
[74:09.47]And you know what?
[74:09.93]It doesn't even matter.
[74:10.51]I'll just show it to you right now.
[74:11.97]Ladies and gentlemen, coming up next is the Ritz Brothers comedy routine.
[74:19.14]Al Ritz, Jimmy Ritz, and Harry Ritz.
[74:25.08]Extreme rules.
[74:27.95]Give you a sneak peek.
[74:34.15]And let me just make sure I can turn the HUD off.
[74:40.04]Where's the gorilla?
[74:42.10]Oh, should I turn the volume all down?
[74:43.42]Oops.
[74:47.86]That's right.
[74:48.22]I had to do that.
[74:49.71]Introducing first in the Ritz Brothers comedy match, they're going to do some slapstick for you, is Harry Ritz.
[75:00.90]I think he's the oldest.
[75:01.72]Also from New York.
[75:08.13]Harry Ritchie?
[75:09.13]What?
[75:11.71]All right, let me see if I can do this.
[75:14.57]Can I turn off the HUD?
[75:15.80]What?
[75:17.84]What?
[75:22.77]go get him there's harry ritz pointing to the ceiling thinking he's getting I don't I think all these guys why does it say that in the bottom right corner I just I think I just put it there yeah these guys are from the the public domain movie night earlier this year was that even might even been 2019.
[75:52.88]Hey, by the way, they don't have to be from this year.
[75:56.22]We have like two years of characters to catch up with.
[76:03.50]When you see one Ritz Brothers entrance, do you really need to see the other two Ritz Brothers entrances?
[76:08.00]That's what I want to ask you guys.
[76:12.71]I guess the answer is yes.
[76:17.13]All 200 pounds.
[76:18.39]All from New York.
[76:20.22]All 200 pounds.
[76:22.04]Which is like a... Oh my God.
[76:23.18]I can't even...
[76:49.01]He's showing his armpits?
[76:51.12]Hey, what do you think of these ones, boys?
[76:57.60]Uh, did they, somebody asked, did they remove custom arenas?
[76:59.84]No, I tried to make one, but 2K20 is such a piece of steaming, burning shit that the game would crash when I change the colors of the ropes.
[77:15.06]You just can't do it, apparently.
[77:16.32]I can't make it through the room.
[77:18.74]Lotion's coming out here.
[77:23.59]Who is this?
[77:24.23]Oh, of course.
[77:24.89]It's the youngest brother.
[77:27.67]That's Jimmy Ritz.
[77:28.75]And from New York, weighing in at 200 pounds, Jimmy Ritchie.
[77:35.82]Their intros are so long.
[77:48.24]This is an Extreme Rules match.
[77:49.98]There's no stakes here, by the way.
[77:51.32]They just wanted to come to Dremel Rumble 2020 and show us their comedy routine.
[77:56.90]The Ritz Brothers are like the Three Stooges, but sort of like the off-brand cereal version of the Three Stooges.
[78:04.10]And I'm going to make a statement here.
[78:05.13]I think the Ritz Brothers are funnier than the Three Stooges.
[78:08.35]I think they have more comedy.
[78:15.51]I think they have much more style.
[78:18.84]Because, I mean, the Three Stooges simply just hit each other in the head with their fists and, like, poked their eyes with their fingers and stuff.
[78:24.78]The Ritz Brothers go on detective searches.
[78:26.84]They cook food.
[78:31.24]But hold on one second here.
[78:32.70]Can I pause it?
[78:33.70]I can't even pause it.
[78:35.77]On stage.
[78:36.73]And, oh, that's a beautiful, beautiful slap to the chest.
[78:43.03]I don't know who is who.
[78:45.15]So, this is the Extreme Rules comedy routine.
[78:51.69]I think that was Jimmy Ritz.
[78:53.81]I think that was Al.
[78:56.47]I don't even know who they are.
[78:59.89]And Jimmy Ritz with a DDT onto Al Ritz's skull.
[79:03.07]Going for a pin automatically.
[79:04.15]He's not going to get it that way.
[79:05.95]As Bob Ritz sticks in here.
[79:08.55]Going for a pilot driver or something.
[79:10.71]Powerbomb.
[79:11.99]What a reversal by Jim Ritz.
[79:15.68]Is he going to let it happen?
[79:16.62]No way.
[79:17.08]You can't just let that happen like that.
[79:19.56]And Al Ritz gets grabbed by a German suplex onto Al Ritz.
[79:27.58]Full punch in the face from Harry Ritz.
[79:31.99]Another one.
[79:33.81]No, a reversal by Jimmy Ritz.
[79:44.46]This is so funny.
[79:46.90]I love how they like bop each other in the head and stuff.
[79:50.21]these guys are so goddamn funny what's he gonna do oh a little slap in the face as jimmy ritz is outside the ring currently grabbing on for dear life as one of the I don't know one of the other ones jimmy ritz is going into this corner here it looks like he might have been looking for something
[80:18.52]Jimmy Ritz is going underneath to get a comedy utensil.
[80:22.14]And he's got a chair.
[80:24.80]The funniest object there is.
[80:26.76]And he doesn't even get to use it.
[80:29.58]He just gets punched in the face by Harry Ritz.
[80:32.58]And a belly-to-belly suplex for his trouble.
[80:37.99]Only one comedy utensil in the ring right now.
[80:41.57]Jimmy Ritz.
[80:42.47]Oh, no.
[80:42.97]All of them go outside.
[80:49.23]And Al Ritz has a sledgehammer.
[80:52.75]Oh, and he misses completely.
[80:54.73]They don't really want to hurt each other.
[80:55.81]They're just actors.
[81:01.63]And Jimmy Ritz takes an eye poke.
[81:03.49]A classic comedy eye poke.
[81:05.83]I think Al Ritz is... I think Harry Ritz is bleeding.
[81:11.35]What is that?
[81:11.95]A pool cue?
[81:16.76]Do not let him pin him.
[81:21.72]There are now three comedy utensils.
[81:23.96]You see, he was like, I'm going to get you.
[81:25.90]Watch out, wise guy.
[81:26.74]Dropping him right on the tailbone.
[81:32.85]That's got to hurt.
[81:37.17]Into the ropes here.
[81:38.01]Misses the punch.
[81:39.31]Great comedy, Duck.
[81:41.88]Oh, they do that so well.
[81:43.96]They're so good at this.
[81:46.02]By the way, everybody needs to know this.
[81:47.36]They're not actually hurting each other.
[81:49.94]They're doing just enough damage and just enough pretending to make it look good on camera.
[81:54.92]Although that one looked real.
[81:56.48]So did that one.
[81:58.54]That one, this looks pretty real, Harry.
[82:00.44]Harry, Harry, you're going a little too hard.
[82:02.76]Cameras aren't even rolling anymore.
[82:05.41]And I think, is that going to be it?
[82:07.59]No way!
[82:08.91]Oh my goodness.
[82:11.11]Jimmy Rett's going to get another comedy utensil down here.
[82:12.99]What do you got?
[82:16.17]He's got a baseball bat.
[82:31.07]It's just comedy.
[82:35.64]They're just pretending.
[82:39.98]They're just pretending, folks.
[82:48.34]It's okay.
[82:49.41]Nobody's actually injured right now.
[82:51.81]Just Jimmy Ritz breaks it up.
[82:54.63]They're just masterful comedians.
[83:01.14]Gonna bring him up to the corner here, up to the top turnbuckle.
[83:04.48]What is Jimmy Ritz planning to do to his brother, Harry Ritz?
[83:08.70]He's got him all the way up here.
[83:09.78]He's gonna go for a suplex.
[83:12.24]A suplex off the top rope!
[83:14.80]Oh, and there's no way Harry's gonna get up from that one.
[83:18.60]This really is a comedy routine.
[83:29.29]So many reversals by Jimmy Ritz.
[83:32.05]Going to go for a forward.
[83:33.19]Wow.
[83:33.73]Beautiful flipping backwards neck breaker there.
[83:37.26]Fantastic stuff.
[83:38.24]Jimmy Ritz going for the pin.
[83:39.16]Can Al get in there quick enough too?
[83:41.46]He completely missed.
[83:45.16]Not the bat again.
[83:46.57]Not the comedy bat.
[83:51.51]DDT by Jimmy Ritz onto Al.
[83:53.51]Al is in bad shape.
[83:57.28]He's in really bad shape right now.
[83:58.87]Because now Jimmy, Harry seems to have the most HP out of the three of them.
[84:05.39]Big dropping suplex there.
[84:06.71]Going to try to go for a pin.
[84:07.47]No, bring him to the center of the ring.
[84:09.67]Lying next to his brother.
[84:10.73]This is a little weird.
[84:14.02]Ooh, face stomp right in the front of the forward part of your face.
[84:20.42]Nice reversal by Jimmy Ritz.
[84:21.70]That hurt his hand.
[84:22.26]He actually hit him.
[84:24.12]We might have to cut here.
[84:25.69]He actually punched him in the face accidentally.
[84:32.13]Put down the sledgehammer.
[84:33.15]No, he... This looks like a finishing move.
[84:36.67]No, it's just a throw.
[84:39.57]Just a throw, and now he's taunting.
[84:43.31]That's Harry Ritz, by the way.
[84:44.97]The strongest of the three brothers.
[84:46.25]Taking it outside.
[84:48.45]Now he gets thrown right back in.
[84:54.67]This is Al, I believe, and Harry is now stuck in the ropes.
[84:58.65]That may have just been a broken neck.
[85:02.01]There's no way that this is going to work out this way.
[85:03.76]Jimmy Ritz is still outside.
[85:04.80]We got a one count.
[85:05.44]We've got a two count hit.
[85:06.82]No!
[85:11.70]And just like every Three Stooges movie and every Ritz Brothers movie, this is going on for way too long.
[85:20.60]It's only so many times you can poke somebody in the eye for 97 straight minutes and Jimmy Ricks comes in with a victory.
[85:30.36]Finishing the comedy routine for the German Rumble 2020.
[85:32.70]I love how we're watching the replay of a pin that didn't work.
[85:43.72]Not even a mention of the bat that was involved earlier.
[85:51.01]they're all dead what please remember predictions well we couldn't do predictions for this one because you can only do two um like one versus one so with a three-way it would be hard to do we'll do it for the next one though I promise
[86:14.69]You know what the funniest part is?
[86:17.55]I thought that that was going to be like the lamest match of the evening.
[86:22.34]But that turned out to somehow be like the best one so far.
[86:32.80]Match two is now over.
[86:35.30]We will now move on.
[86:39.21]Why do they look like Herman Munster?
[86:40.11]I don't know.
[86:47.00]Dude, when they just kept trading the bat back and forth and hitting each other in the face.
[86:51.49]Oh, God.
[86:54.11]That was funny.
[86:54.51]All right, moving on.
[86:56.41]We got some more categories to do, obviously.
[87:00.74]We actually, you know what?
[87:02.10]We'll take a break after this next run of categories.
[87:04.24]How does that sound?
[87:06.68]Let's turn that volume mixer down and we come back to this.
[87:09.84]The next one.
[87:12.09]We'll take a break after this.
[87:12.85]Yeah.
[87:18.58]Welcome back to the awards section of this stream.
[87:22.14]Maybe should I get some light on me?
[87:26.00]I got jump scared?
[87:26.74]Oh, I'm sorry.
[87:28.82]Best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[87:31.17]And you're probably wondering, what happened to worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up?
[87:36.07]Well, there really wasn't very many, or they were so bad that they could not even be nominated.
[87:41.03]So we only have a best of this year for 2020.
[87:47.06]It just, like, burped so loud inside of my body.
[87:50.53]If there was a microphone inside of my esophagus down here, you guys would have freaked out.
[87:54.83]It was really loud in here.
[87:57.13]I could hear that internally.
[88:02.24]What is up?
[88:03.98]Gas.
[88:10.10]Well, no, no, I didn't do the nominations yet.
[88:11.96]Uh-oh.
[88:13.01]CBD's kicking in.
[88:14.73]All right, so best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[88:16.84]What this means is I kind of just take a few minutes to do something, and I set it up, and I try to make people laugh.
[88:25.36]And let's say four to ten times it works out.
[88:27.79]The other six, I get ridiculed off the stream.
[88:32.33]But here we go.
[88:33.23]Here are the nominees for best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[88:37.54]What's in the cup?
[88:38.80]It's just a little, it's just a little CBD, THC, sippy, you know?
[88:43.36]Nothing major, just something to have fun and relax.
[88:45.22]All right, here come the nominees.
[88:48.63]Four.
[88:48.93]Uh, best joke taking four of the five?
[88:53.59]Okay, it's hit me.
[89:02.91]Uh-oh, there was an estimate that there was going to be a SPI stimulus package and it didn't happen.
[89:09.67]Oh shit, all the investors were expecting it.
[89:12.73]It didn't happen.
[89:13.59]CEO tweeted out picture of asshole with two middle fingers on it and said fuck all investors.
[89:24.38]Oh, holy shit.
[89:25.68]That's the only way this would have happened.
[89:29.20]Come on.
[89:33.01]Hello?
[89:34.03]Hey, what's up?
[89:34.89]It's me.
[89:35.98]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[89:36.80]How are you doing?
[89:37.88]I'm doing good.
[89:38.38]Did you get my messages that I sent you?
[89:40.24]Yes, I did.
[89:41.08]You know what to do.
[89:42.26]You know what to do, man of the hour.
[89:44.80]Say it.
[89:45.63]Say the line.

[90:50.48]I love it.
[90:52.18]Professor Michaels took a fraternity test.
[90:56.12]to find out if they were the father of Mrs. Stevenson's baby.

[91:07.10]And by the way, hey, Mr., Mr., whatever your fucking name is, I can't believe you, you want to tell me that's my baby?

[91:24.25]Another CCTV.
[91:31.36]Holy... Holy shit, Jerry!
[91:36.52]And what started as a small confrontation has turned into an absolute bloodbath brawl outside of the 7-Eleven!
[91:43.00]It looks like they're upset that... McDonald's is... They're upset that...
[91:52.00]Roger, I'm not even entirely sure where they got these weapons.
[91:55.84]The battle for Home Depot.
[92:00.89]Roger, people on social media are calling this the Battle of Home Depot.
[92:06.47]A big bunny.
[92:07.25]There you go.
[92:09.91]Mom, my mother's probably watching the stream going, what the fuck is this kid doing?
[92:13.15]I didn't raise him like this.
[92:15.43]Hey, um...
[92:19.80]Yeah, I'm alright.
[92:20.72]I just had some work done.
[92:21.88]This is what a toddler does when they know they did something wrong.
[92:29.44]That should be an emote.
[92:31.22]Stanley Kubrick.
[92:36.07]Kubrick stare.
[92:41.85]Yeah, I'll take... Can I take a bite and will you guys get over this?
[92:47.17]If I take a bite of this, will you get over it?
[93:06.57]Fucking Sans.
[93:13.81]He should never have been in the game.
[93:15.07]He's not even a Nintendo character.
[93:16.51]All right, let's go.
[93:18.80]Right behind you.
[93:21.38]Right behind him.

[94:50.39]And he's just sneezing.
[94:53.05]What are you doing over there?
[94:55.11]Otto, who do you think is going to win?
[94:57.63]What do you think is going to win?
[94:58.57]Best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[95:02.64]Cookies.
[95:04.50]Well, that's not a category, Otto.
[95:07.42]That's not a nominee.
[95:08.16]Okay.
[95:13.86]The winner of best joke of the year, taking more than five, which is pretty much best joke of the year.
[95:18.90]Let's just go for it.
[95:19.72]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner.
[95:24.34]With 20.86% of the vote, Jigsaw House.
[95:25.96]With 20.08% of the vote, Eating the Shoe.
[95:27.18]Lost very close, very close.
[95:44.52]In third place was AEU, which I know that it's supposed to be five minutes, but I think that bit went on for like 30.
[95:50.79]So it was allowed.
[95:56.75]Just chilling?
[95:58.81]Yeah, Jigsaw House, 15.7% for AEU, by the way.
[96:05.27]Recency bias, recency bias.
[96:07.69]Probably, but, you know, it's still fun.
[96:12.32]All right, coming up, we have, let's take a look.
[96:15.80]I got another match to do, but I want to take a break first.
[96:18.54]So we have, how many was that?
[96:21.60]The best jokes we had, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two.
[96:25.18]All right, so we have, we'll do two more.
[96:30.03]cookies was robbed yeah well whatever uh this is the two of the night that I think are going to be the most irritating to sit through for a lot of you guys so I just want to give you a warning now some of you guys that might be new here you might leave the stream in about two minutes uh the next categories are going to be worst noise of the year and best noise of the year and there were a shitload of nominees the I there's like 20 nominees in worst noise
[96:58.91]So strap yourself in and get ready to hear some of the things you don't ever want to hear ever again.
[97:06.96]There sure were.
[97:08.02]Yes, there were.
[97:10.06]So here are the nominees, ladies and gentlemen, for Worst Noise of the Year.
[97:19.67]You didn't even see me.
[97:23.75]Whatever.
[97:33.57]Okay, somebody just squeezed a little too much air out of me.
[97:39.63]All right, this is cool.
[97:44.78]I'm gonna sneeze, but I cannot mute my microphone.
[97:53.18]Funny man, make a funny noise.
[97:54.82]Funny man, make a funny noise.
[97:56.06]All right, fine.
[98:01.91]I don't think I could hit a bong, man.
[98:03.33]I really don't think I could in real life.
[98:04.81]I would probably fucking fall down.
[98:09.30]I would hit the bong and be like... Also nominated for worst face.
[98:24.59]If you remember.
[98:31.92]What do these, um... What do these, like, little, like, white things on the ground do?
[98:36.93]Are these, like, collectibles?
[98:38.87]What?
[98:39.09]I didn't fucking see that guy.
[98:39.95]Give us a joke?
[98:40.45]You got it.
[99:06.82]Did I do it?
[99:21.87]It's hitting him!
[99:25.18]It's not hitting him!
[99:27.08]It's not hitting him!
[99:28.46]It's hitting him now!
[99:29.48]I got it!
[99:31.87]Cover it with cheese.
[99:33.63]The ooey gooey cheesy.
[99:35.75]Oh yeah.
[99:36.39]Oh my god.
[99:36.99]Does it have like a bunch of fucking nacho cheese on it?
[99:39.67]Or based?
[99:41.59]I know.
[99:42.03]I get it.
[99:42.73]But it's still good.
[99:46.74]Oh, how can we make a... How can we make like a Caesar salad better?
[99:50.62]Hmm.
[99:51.96]Cover it with ooey gooey yummy cheesy cheesy cheesy.
[99:56.90]Jerma is just a scary motherfucker.
[99:59.50]No, but am I though?
[100:03.86]I completely disagree.
[100:07.84]I disagree.
[100:09.38]Lick Wailord.
[100:11.68]Oh, dude.
[100:12.40]Wouldn't that be so gross?
[100:20.95]Oh.
[100:24.80]What happened?
[100:27.68]Oh my God, dude.
[100:28.74]Where is he?
[100:29.76]I'm good.
[100:30.48]Oh, come on.
[101:03.40]sound oh excuse me that was not a donkey sound this is a donkey sound oh that's one of those ducks at the store that you squeeze the dog toy never mind that's right so many nominees so many nominees for this category but they can only be one winner
[101:32.48]Uh, there can only be three that are even listed.
[101:35.40]So, the winner of the best noise of the year... No, no, no, shit, that's wrong.
[101:40.62]It's worst noise of the year.
[101:41.98]The winner of worst noise of the year is going to be... With 11.66% of the vote, we have Ooey Gooey.
[101:51.47]Ooey Gooey won with 11.66%.
[101:52.59]Um...
[102:03.64]I think, you know, it's not even a noise.
[102:05.26]I just talked.
[102:07.22]I just said a sentence.
[102:09.26]I think it's just everybody hated the sentence, therefore nominated it so often and everybody voted for it.
[102:16.62]So after that, very, very close though, with 11.16% of the vote, so another very, very close one, even closer than the last one, was the horrendous pig.
[102:29.46]So if you want to be a purist here, you could say that the horrendous pig was the worst noise of the year.
[102:36.34]And ooey gooey was the most hated phrase of the year.
[102:41.27]After that, at 9.05% is Chewbacca transforming.
[102:46.78]I could see that.
[102:49.12]I could see that.
[102:50.60]Yeah, I could see that.
[102:53.83]Acceptable.
[102:54.35]Yeah.
[102:54.89]That's an acceptable win.
[102:56.67]There are your winners.
[102:59.61]What's the next one?
[103:00.27]Right here.
[103:01.59]So just like worst noise, we have best noise.
[103:04.38]Now, best noise doesn't include anything like singing or anything.
[103:08.62]This is just what people thought was a better sound, thought it was cooler, thought it was funnier.
[103:15.09]The only thing I can't believe about this one is...
[103:19.35]There's a nominee on here that is so ear-screechingly horrible that I cannot comprehend why it is not in the other category.
[103:30.38]So just be aware, there is like ear scraping.
[103:33.54]There's like ear, like a Q-tip going in there and just like... I'm just warning you now.
[103:42.71]Here we go.
[103:43.75]Nominees for best noise of the year.
[103:50.82]Wanted to warn you.
[103:59.38]Where's best noise?
[104:02.99]Best noise of the year!
[104:14.49]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die!
[104:20.10]You're never gonna get a pan fully clean like this.
[104:25.06]My ears!
[104:26.86]Hi, everybody.
[104:30.57]What is this?
[104:30.95]What's over there?
[104:51.92]And stop!
[104:52.59]No whammies!
[104:54.07]Nobody tell her.
[104:55.17]Don't tell me what.
[104:57.47]Don't hold that shit for me.
[105:00.67]Take a look at this scrumptious cheese!
[105:08.24]Cheese!
[105:15.47]Pizza.
[105:25.35]Neck thickness.
[105:27.03]Oh, God.
[105:28.39]It's like I swallowed, I like cartoon Python swallowed a plate or something.
[105:35.90]My character right now is going like.
[105:39.44]And I want you to listen to that crunch.
[105:49.43]You were wrong.
[105:49.95]You were wrong.
[105:50.63]Oh, I got it.
[105:53.13]Okay, I got it.
[105:56.96]Hmm.
[106:19.60]okay so the winner of the best noise of the year I think won this like a year or two ago I can't do this anymore either because when I do this people just vote for it people just nominate and people just go yeah that's the one uh the winner is well I gotta play the fanfare
[106:48.22]Didgeridoo at 20.36% of the vote.
[106:51.08]So more than 20% of the vote.
[106:54.09]Didgeridoo won.
[106:56.13]And then Doi Doi, which got 14.5% of the vote, which confuses me because the first time I ever did the Doi Doi thing, people screamed at me.
[107:05.62]They said, stop.
[107:06.34]That hurts my ears.
[107:07.38]I hate it.
[107:08.26]Never do that again.
[107:09.42]Don't ever do the Doi Doi Doi thing ever again.
[107:12.68]And then two years later, I do the doy doy doy thing again, and all of a sudden now it's second place for best noise of the year.
[107:19.91]What happened?
[107:21.45]Your tastes change?
[107:22.23]I'm going to do it right now.
[107:28.12]There you go.
[107:41.78]Oh, and My Ears won with 11.5% in third place.
[107:46.14]I'm leaving.
[107:46.96]Don't leave, please!
[107:51.60]11.5% for My Ears, which is the one that would hurt.
[107:53.70]That's the one that hurt.
[107:56.09]I think, does that catch us up?
[107:57.41]Are we ready for another match?
[107:59.77]After we take a break?
[108:00.91]Let's see.
[108:01.59]How caught up are we?
[108:02.79]Was that four?
[108:04.66]believe that was four we had one one two three four one two three four one two three yes we did okay all right let's take a quick break I'll be right back I'm gonna just get another maybe another drink maybe uh see if auto needs to get anything see if auto needs to go out and I'll be right back see you guys in a minute
[111:48.10]Hey, hello.
[111:49.82]Hi, everybody.
[111:51.56]I have returned to set up the next match in the Rumble.
[111:57.69]So the next match is going to be a four-way.
[112:01.03]Tables, I believe.
[112:01.75]Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.
[112:06.13]Don't be sus.
[112:07.49]Oh, God.
[112:10.97]There always has to be a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.
[112:15.81]Hear the crowd?
[112:19.71]Let me make sure the next one is set up.
[112:25.25]Yeah, here it comes.
[112:25.83]Hold on a sec.
[112:32.85]Let me get that over here.
[112:34.27]Okay.
[112:37.43]Where is this?
[112:38.31]I need to move this.
[112:42.65]Ow.
[112:44.45]This light is... Oh, shit.
[112:45.33]Okay, I don't want to break anything.
[112:46.63]Alright, so again, this is a TLC match.
[112:50.71]God.
[112:51.05]TLC, and it is between a lot of different fandoms.
[113:00.18]A lot of different fandoms here.
[113:03.06]If you could think of a certain group of people that love a certain franchise or certain characters, you'd put them into a crew, wouldn't you?
[113:17.65]And we've had quite a few crews over the years.
[113:21.70]Especially considering the last couple of years.
[113:26.23]The next match is going to be a four-way between those crews.
[113:33.97]So let's go.
[113:39.10]Welcome back to the rumble portion of the stream.
[113:49.52]First character being introduced is Murius of the Moo Crew.
[113:57.90]Also was nominated for Best Character of the Year.
[113:59.82]Ooh, 220.
[114:08.07]That's not... The name of that animal is not Mega Milk.
[114:11.35]It is Murius.
[114:14.53]Representing the Moo Crew.
[114:19.75]Ladder back there.
[114:20.67]Whoa!
[114:22.80]Somebody in the audience, he must have that gray leash attached to him.
[114:27.96]I know how he gets when that's on him.
[114:33.24]The anger leash.
[114:39.35]Our next competitor coming in here to challenge the Moo Crew and the other two are the Wink Dinks.
[114:50.51]German wink.
[114:53.75]And his opponents first from New York, weighing in at 220 pounds.
[115:02.45]Superstar OK.
[115:05.37]So yeah, 75,000 channel points.
[115:07.05]A lot of you got really into that, so obviously German wink wanted to come and represent himself.
[115:11.77]To represent the wink dinks.
[115:16.89]Can you guess where this guy is from?
[115:19.00]Coming up next.
[115:27.41]I wonder... You know what?
[115:33.29]I'm going to put my money on the Dinks tonight.
[115:35.57]I think they have a lot riding here.
[115:37.33]They've been waiting for Winx to come back for like a year and a half, and they're just not coming back.
[115:41.19]Most dedicated fan base, I think, is... But wait a minute.
[115:43.61]I'll be talking about dedicated fan bases.
[115:45.99]We're talking about dedicated fan bases.
[115:47.63]I think that's Nancy Drew.
[115:50.63]That's Nancy Drew.
[115:56.01]Representing the Drew crew.
[115:59.81]Nancy Drew.
[116:02.63]With her ATV looking to find a new part of, a new clue for an old Egyptian temple.
[116:10.93]Stumbled her way in here.
[116:12.34]She knew that she needed to be represented.
[116:23.74]But that's not all.
[116:25.50]There's still one more group.
[116:27.44]One more incredibly, incredibly important group in this channel, in this universe here.
[116:34.11]You know, I talk about it all the time.
[116:35.75]I say it all the time.
[116:36.81]I address you guys as such.
[116:47.69]Still on Nancy Drew, though.
[116:50.09]It's the Banana Brothers!
[116:52.65]Oh, and nobody seems to like the Banana Brothers.
[117:00.36]Everybody hates the banana bros.
[117:03.98]Why are they booing the banana bros?
[117:11.79]Somebody wrote, oh my god, fuck this guy.
[117:14.85]Alright, can I skip this?
[117:16.21]Can I skip this ship?
[117:25.28]Everybody hates him.
[117:27.78]I love this guy.
[117:32.06]I love the Banana Bros.
[117:38.41]Murius, the Wink Dinks.
[117:40.03]Moo Crew, Wink Dinks, Drew Crew.
[117:42.73]Versus the Banana Bros.
[117:45.33]Fatal four away.
[117:46.69]Tables, ladders, and chairs match.
[117:49.07]Nancy Drew is not wasting a single second of her time.
[117:53.97]Throwing Murius into the ropes.
[117:55.25]Over the ropes now.
[117:56.89]There are no rules here.
[117:59.49]Zero rules.
[118:02.05]It's just whoever loses.
[118:03.63]Wait, where are all the items?
[118:07.36]Where are all the items?
[118:10.12]It's supposed to be tables, ladders, and chairs.
[118:11.74]I don't see a single table.
[118:13.08]I don't see a single ladder.
[118:15.38]I don't see a single chair.
[118:20.70]You forgot to put them out?
[118:23.40]What?
[118:23.62]Are you serious?
[118:29.60]Oh, the banana.
[118:30.20]The banana is getting absolutely bruised right now.
[118:34.92]Am I blind?
[118:35.56]What do you mean?
[118:40.04]It's under the ring?
[118:40.79]Where are they going?
[118:43.45]No, no.
[118:43.91]I see up top, up top, up top, up top.
[118:49.59]Holy shit, that was a big right-hand overhead smash from Murius onto Nancy Drew.
[118:53.81]By the way, whoever wins this, this is what I will call this channel's community for the next six months.
[119:02.66]So, there's a lot riding on this one.
[119:13.34]Big punching match here in the middle of the ring.
[119:16.08]Murius seems to have missed that double twisted kick-a-boozle.
[119:22.91]What?
[119:24.23]A kick-a-paloozle?
[119:29.47]Somebody get a table in here.
[119:32.39]Oh, finally, the Banana Bro is always taking the initiative.
[119:36.06]Reaching under the ring, getting the first ladder of the evening.
[119:41.09]Yeah, one of the most dedicated, one of the most passionate fandoms on this channel, the Banana Bros.
[119:49.70]Looks like he's going to... No, he's not going to be able to have any time.
[119:51.54]The ladder was stolen by the Wink Dinks.
[119:57.11]Wink Dink just wants to get up there.
[119:58.63]I don't think he was supposed to... No, they're just setting it up, ready to go.
[120:03.44]Nancy Drew and Murius have been outside this whole time.
[120:06.10]Just punching each other in the face.
[120:08.25]Oh, and she heard me.
[120:10.47]That was a huge kick from Nancy Drew.
[120:14.59]Ooh, DDT onto the ladder.
[120:19.85]Might see a ladder set up here.
[120:28.20]Of all the things you could have done, Banana Bro, that was probably the worst one to do.
[120:33.10]Mirrius setting up the ladder, though.
[120:34.36]Mirrius thinking about getting... No.
[120:36.64]Mirrius is getting something else.
[120:39.72]Mirrius is going to get one of the chairs over here.
[120:42.43]He went a long way to get that single chair.
[120:46.87]I hope it was worth it.
[120:48.43]Just like in black and white, the AI is so bad with their pathing, but he gets the hit.
[120:52.95]He gets two hits.
[120:55.21]And Andrew was just concerned about what was currently happening, and Mirrius...
[121:01.47]Cleaning up right now.
[121:02.49]The Mu Crew.
[121:06.99]Big elbow drop.
[121:11.43]Nancy Drew was just trying to stop.
[121:12.95]She was looking at her dialogue options.
[121:17.58]One of them was, please don't hit him.
[121:19.22]The other one was, how much did that cost?
[121:21.66]And the other one was, where can I find the bar?
[121:25.84]Murius is getting up to the top.
[121:28.11]No, Nancy Drew throws him down, kicking him right into his sternum.
[121:35.87]Both going outside again.
[121:37.17]There's an opportunity here for Banana Bros.
[121:39.85]Doesn't look like they're going to capitalize, though.
[121:41.78]Nancy Drew with a swinging neck breaker.
[121:46.94]But wink-dink from behind, Nancy Drew.
[121:49.02]Oh, shit.
[121:53.61]And the wink dink, he's signaling his crowd.
[121:56.21]Everybody to wink in the crowd.
[121:57.41]Banana Bro, what are you doing?
[122:03.96]He wanted attention.
[122:05.24]They're all just craving your attention.
[122:08.00]They're all just trying to get attention.
[122:10.87]They so badly want you to look at them.
[122:14.35]Moo Crew, Moo Crew.
[122:15.81]Banana Bros, this way, Banana Bros.
[122:18.31]Banana Bros out.
[122:23.76]Ladder set up again.
[122:24.62]Murius going in for a swinging DDT tornado style.
[122:31.20]Mukru signaling his fans now to spam the chat room.
[122:37.84]Big right hand on to Nancy Drew.
[122:39.87]Swinging her around.
[122:40.69]Dropping down.
[122:42.43]And this opportunity is being taken by the Wink Dinks.
[122:44.85]Wink Dinks are going up, but Murius...
[122:47.36]He's almost going to get it.
[122:48.24]Is he going to get it?
[122:49.44]Furious going for the punch in the stomach.
[122:51.02]Is the Wink Dinks going to win?
[122:52.50]Can the Wink Dinks possibly secure this?
[122:55.41]Three punches.
[122:56.19]Four punches in the stomach.
[122:57.35]And here comes the Banana Bro.
[122:59.43]No.
[123:00.39]He's trying to push it down.
[123:02.67]Why is nobody trying to grab?
[123:04.39]He can't even push it down.
[123:05.49]He's not strong enough.
[123:13.18]Why did he take it?
[123:15.08]Why did he take it?
[123:19.78]They're just running into each other.
[123:23.53]Big belly-to-back suplex by Burius.
[123:26.61]Signaling the move through.
[123:27.47]He's ready.
[123:28.47]He's ready to have you guys be called that for the next six months.
[123:33.44]Nancy Drew has finally gotten up.
[123:35.08]Finally.
[123:35.80]Finally.
[123:37.11]Getting back into the ring, it seems like ages ago that she was in this, and she's going to take the opportunity to go up Nancy Drew with the Drew Crew going up to the top rope.
[123:42.90]Going on top, she's got the briefcase.
[123:45.62]Is Nancy Drew going to pull this off in the absolute calamity going on?
[123:53.63]Nancy Drew might have actually just gotten this.
[123:56.49]She can't do the mini game.
[123:58.51]She was always so bad at this one.
[124:05.74]Grabbing his arm.
[124:06.94]Wink Dinks is throwing down Murius.
[124:11.24]Caught in the ropes.
[124:14.18]Wink Dink is very strong right now.
[124:15.96]Murius has the most health.
[124:18.38]But, uh-oh.
[124:19.89]Now, wait.
[124:20.53]No, no, no, no.
[124:20.99]You got to get back in there, Banana Bro.
[124:22.19]You can't just... You got to get in there.
[124:25.05]You got to push that thing over right now.
[124:27.65]You almost got it.
[124:29.28]Push it over.
[124:29.82]Push it over.
[124:30.46]I don't want to call everybody wink dinks for the next six months.
[124:32.86]Don't.
[124:33.66]Push it over.
[124:34.66]Somebody get up there, please.
[124:36.58]Murius, please.
[124:38.64]Somebody stop it.
[124:39.40]Nancy Drew, run your ATV into here and run it over.
[124:43.36]How has he still got this?
[124:45.58]Banana Brew's just like, yeah, I don't understand.
[124:47.23]This is fucked up.
[124:50.21]Big powerbomb up there.
[124:57.68]I don't know what happened.
[125:00.04]Why is she on the top rope?
[125:02.76]Wait, why is she sitting on the top rope?
[125:04.12]Banana Bro got the ladder.
[125:05.96]Setting it up.
[125:06.82]Is this the Banana Bro's victory lap right now?
[125:09.68]Looks at Nancy Drew.
[125:10.62]Does not attack her.
[125:13.34]She's on the top rope.
[125:14.26]Is she going to go for it?
[125:15.42]No!
[125:17.12]That was the worst thing you could have done, Nancy Drew.
[125:19.71]Catches him.
[125:24.84]The skill, the necessity of that moment.
[125:30.47]She investigated.
[125:32.33]She took a look at her clues.
[125:34.07]She found out that that was probably the best idea.
[125:35.65]Maybe it's going to be a good enough idea to win this match and be called the Drew Crew for the next six months.
[125:39.67]Nancy Drew, ladies and gentlemen, has unlatched it.
[125:44.80]The Drew Crew prevails once again, as they always do.
[125:51.85]Drew Crew has prevailed.
[125:53.47]Nancy Drew with the win.
[125:59.00]Nancy Drew.
[126:00.36]Well, congratulations to Nancy Drew.
[126:05.33]Drew Crew.
[126:07.09]That's what you guys are going to be called now.
[126:12.33]You're the Drew Crew now for at least six months.
[126:15.60]That was a huge clutch.
[126:16.98]The big jumping, two-handed, two-foot stomp.
[126:21.26]Kicking off the top rope.
[126:24.64]That's a deserved win for Nancy Drew.
[126:28.80]Banana Bros, you had a chance, but you really blew it.
[126:30.68]All right, let's keep going.
[126:39.91]That was match number three.
[126:40.71]There is another match before the Rumble.
[126:43.43]We got some more categories to do, though.
[126:50.25]Turn that down.
[126:52.41]I will be joining you back here in a sec.
[126:55.85]Like this.
[126:57.99]Hello.
[126:59.58]So coming up on the next nominee, the next nominees.
[127:04.70]A very, very, I like this category a lot.
[127:06.96]I feel like this happens all the time, so there's a lot to choose from.
[127:09.86]It is a best scare moment.
[127:12.60]Best time that I was ever scared on stream.
[127:14.94]Whether a jump scare or likewise.
[127:19.12]Is he high?
[127:22.86]Probably a little.
[127:24.06]Probably a little.
[127:24.50]It's New Year's Eve.
[127:25.02]Whatever.
[127:25.32]What do you want?
[127:28.30]Maybe just a little.
[127:29.58]Maybe just a little bit.
[127:30.96]It's a small amount.
[127:33.34]He's fucking zonked.
[127:38.63]No, I'm not.
[127:43.27]The wink dinks did all the work.
[127:45.66]the wing things did all the work and then nancy drew uh just kind of nancy drew in the banner bros really just capitalized so hey what can I tell you I don't make the rules we just watch uh so here are the nominees for best scare of the year I played vr this year so you know there's gonna be at least like 10 of those so here they are best scare of the year
[128:15.28]You do make the rules.
[128:16.36]No, I don't.
[128:19.42]What the fuck?
[128:20.36]Oh my god.
[128:21.28]I thought that was in real life.
[128:22.54]That scared the shit out of me.
[128:24.00]I was like, who's here?
[128:25.34]Why are you here?
[128:25.98]What the fuck?
[128:33.56]Okay, that was fucking... That was one of the scariest things I've ever seen in my life.
[128:37.70]That's one of the scariest things I've ever seen in my whole life.
[128:40.20]That was horrible.
[128:40.80]That was horrible.
[128:41.72]That was terrifying.
[128:42.40]That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
[128:43.94]In my whole life.
[128:53.60]There are more copies of Wii Sports out in the wild than there are ants.
[128:57.06]I know, but I didn't want one.
[129:06.93]That was the warning?
[129:08.95]What do you mean I just got warned?
[129:17.18]What happened?
[129:20.10]Oh my god, dude.
[129:21.26]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[129:50.72]Peek into the hallway?
[129:57.78]What?
[129:58.30]I peaked down the hallway.
[130:03.41]Holy shit, really?
[130:11.56]What the fuck is that sound?
[130:20.67]Ow, my chest.
[130:22.41]My whole body hurts.
[130:23.53]My whole body hurts.
[130:25.57]Oh, my God.
[130:26.27]What the... Oh, my God, dude.
[130:29.76]Okay.
[130:36.32]So, you've seen the nominees.
[130:39.40]The winner of best scare moment of the year.
[130:41.43]Let me see what won first.
[130:49.58]Uh, what do you think?
[130:51.28]Let's see what the people think here now.
[130:55.10]Cheater?
[130:56.78]You can't cheat in an award show.
[130:58.25]Oh, you probably, yeah, actually you can.
[131:00.23]Yeah, you can.
[131:00.89]You probably can.
[131:01.35]Award shows.
[131:06.53]The deer, the deer, the deer.
[131:07.69]I'm seeing a lot of deer.
[131:11.87]Hate to disappoint all the people that are saying, dear, the winner of best scare moment of the year is peeking down the hallway at 17% of the vote.
[131:24.37]In Five Nights at Freddy's, I was lied to.
[131:27.25]I was told that that's not supposed to happen.
[131:29.70]I was told that that was just like a 0.2% chance.
[131:32.92]And I was told to do it again.
[131:33.70]And it happened again.
[131:34.90]And then I realized I was very angry with you.
[131:38.54]So yeah, you got me twice.
[131:41.64]That was 17%.
[131:42.12]They were all still pretty close.
[131:44.32]No air left was 12.82%, which I'll be honest with you, that was probably, for me at least, if this was no voting allowed here, that would be the worst one for me.
[131:57.92]I remember that very vividly.
[131:59.10]It was fucking horrible.
[132:00.90]And then bunny in the room at 12.5%, that one got pretty high because, I mean, I was, like, drinking.
[132:07.50]Right?
[132:07.78]I had been drinking, and it was just so easy just to get the shit out of me so that I could understand.
[132:12.20]I was pretty jumpy.
[132:14.22]So, yeah, that's, uh, peeking down the hallway.
[132:16.74]Wins the best scare moment.
[132:21.20]Drunk.
[132:21.50]Yeah, I was, I was, yeah, I was.
[132:24.86]He took the headset off.
[132:25.78]He was so scared.
[132:30.32]Okay, let's, uh, what do we got?
[132:31.36]We have, I'm gonna make sure there's enough left to do the end, too.
[132:35.51]Oh, yeah, there is.
[132:36.91]Let me get the, all right, let's get this one out of the way now.
[132:40.29]Because I want the top categories to be the last thing that we do before the Rumble or after the Rumble.
[132:48.49]Okay, so the next one, this is best accident.
[132:51.81]I tend to have lots of accidents on stream, whether that's falling down somewhere IRL, whether that's messing up something, saying something I shouldn't say.
[133:02.08]This is a new category.
[133:05.75]I make mistakes all the time.
[133:07.51]I'm only human.
[133:08.56]I make mistakes, and I have to live with them, okay?
[133:11.88]So here are the nominees for the best accidents of the year.
[133:33.93]This is not the way I'm going out this is not the way I'm going out on Twitter
[133:51.71]All right, long story short, I can bring the switch to the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep my hands close and not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over.
[134:04.41]Okay, my nieces and nephews love Lego Star Wars.
[134:08.38]It's like their favorite thing in the world.
[134:10.28]And I got a text from my parents
[134:14.74]and from my sister.
[134:17.04]That said, hey, um, just want to let you know the kids were watching your stream because they love Lego Star Wars and we had to mute you because you kept saying fuck so much.
[134:29.44]Show us the console.
[134:30.88]All right, hold on.
[134:31.46]Let me show you the console.
[134:40.36]don't whatever am I wearing beads on my wrist that you saw it god damn it it's it's black tourmaline it's like a crystal bracelet I I I'm just wearing it because um I it's a crystal bracelet it's black tourmaline
[135:01.33]And it's supposed to help with your energy.
[135:03.49]It's not.
[135:03.94]It's made up.
[135:04.60]Like, it's literally all made up.
[135:06.34]This is kind of how I feel.
[135:09.52]Like, 40% of every day.
[135:11.14]Can I tell you that?
[135:12.38]Not like that.
[135:12.88]Not like that.
[135:13.30]Not like that.
[135:13.72]Not like that.
[135:14.12]Not like that.
[135:16.16]So, what can I do for you?
[135:20.12]Tell me about... Tell me about Paseo Del Mar High.
[135:23.98]It's already... People are already... No.
[135:26.30]No, no, no, no.
[135:28.93]Oh my god!
[135:30.40]No, this is gonna be... No, no!
[135:38.72]Stop!
[135:39.40]Stop!
[135:40.16]Stop!
[135:41.04]Stop!
[135:41.40]Stop!
[135:41.66]Stop!
[135:41.90]Stop!
[135:42.17]I'm gonna make it more expensive!
[135:43.43]I'm gonna make it more expensive!
[135:44.39]Alright, I'm gonna turn it off!
[135:45.43]I'm gonna turn it off!
[135:45.93]I'm gonna make it more expensive!
[135:47.47]I... I... I... I... I... Remember, I'm mid-piss.
[135:50.39]I'm peeing.
[135:51.25]It's mid-piss.
[135:51.99]It's like a 20 to 30 second full piss.
[135:53.79]This didn't even happen on stream.
[135:55.14]10 seconds into the full piss.
[135:57.83]I drop it, write it, and I'm pissing on the phone.
[135:59.82]I'm pissing on the phone, and it's in piss water, into the toilet.
[136:02.88]Peeing on it.
[136:05.36]There we are.
[136:06.14]That's pretty good.
[136:10.15]Yeah.
[136:22.98]What happened?
[136:24.42]Okay, so... So, what has happened is I pressed the back button, and this is when I, uh, when I searched for AI Dungeon an hour and a half ago to play it, and I spelt it, uh, just a little, a little incorrect.
[136:40.82]What?
[136:42.20]What's this doing on here?
[136:44.00]What's this doing on here?
[136:48.68]Oh, shit!
[136:51.85]Where is this picture?
[136:54.63]What's wrong with this one?
[136:58.95]Wasn't on fucking purpose, I swear to God.
[137:00.54]I swear to God.
[137:01.76]I swear to God.
[137:09.88]Why are you doing this?
[137:12.84]No, no, I just... I just... I just own the Raving Rabbids fucking ultimate party collection, which is every single video game they made.
[137:27.02]Oh, come on!
[137:40.55]What?
[137:55.19]Hey, German on A5 here.
[138:00.32]Holy shit.
[138:03.50]This is something I can't show on stream.
[138:06.54]So as you see, new category, new thing to feed through, right?
[138:26.36]Feed through?
[138:28.65]Oh, he's getting zonked on stream.
[138:31.79]So the winner of the best accident... He's fucking zooted.
[138:38.83]The best accident was you.
[138:40.11]Oh, you motherfucker.
[138:54.54]Okay, anyways, the winner of...
[138:59.25]The winner of... Best accident is... Got him.
[139:08.50]Oh, you didn't hear it.
[139:09.04]Come on.
[139:13.94]At 18.5% of the vote, Chuck E. Cheese.
[139:23.39]I just keep thinking about what that guy said over and over again.
[139:26.77]Kissing Chuck E. Cheese was at 18.5% of the vote.
[139:31.87]That was very bad.
[139:33.17]Very bad accident.
[139:35.05]If you were not here for that stream, like I said earlier, Chuck E. Cheese raided the stream and was here and we were being fucking weird and then somebody linked a picture of me kissing him and I showed it on stream accidentally.
[139:46.74]He was here and he was hosting the channel.
[139:48.68]So that's a pretty big accident.
[139:50.95]That was 18.5% and then naked was 16.9%.
[139:56.22]So that was, it's still close.
[139:57.75]So just under 17% for naked.
[139:59.41]And streaming and driving was 12.6% at number three.
[140:06.89]I don't know.
[140:07.17]I'm not sure I agree with number three.
[140:08.96]I think I might put something else there.
[140:12.66]But Lego Star Wars was robbed.
[140:17.95]Yeah, kissing Chuck E. Cheese is the winner.
[140:20.17]Which... I mean, that was a pretty horrible fucking accident, so... What do we have left that's not... The final four.
[140:29.00]Okay.
[140:30.54]Here we are.
[140:32.38]So, this next one coming up... Is...
[140:36.29]Worst Meltdown, which... Worst Meltdown's different than a lot... It's hard to do Worst Meltdown because so many of the nominees could be entire streams.
[140:47.63]So it's not necessarily just one moment or two moments or... It could be the whole entire broadcast.
[140:55.63]So we kind of let things pass where it could be just a full stream.
[140:59.86]So keep that in mind when you're watching these nominees.
[141:05.19]13 straight hours of it, potentially.
[141:06.63]Yeah.
[141:08.15]Here are the nominees for worst meltdown of the year, either moment or stream in particular.
[141:12.89]I'm going to lose.
[141:34.38]Oh my god!
[141:35.74]Oh my god!
[141:36.88]I just broke something!
[141:39.74]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[141:45.51]He's having a little cranky wanky right now!
[141:48.87]This game is too hard!
[141:52.57]I don't like it!
[141:53.63]How do I beat this?
[141:55.63]I need a bumper!
[141:57.03]I need to go to bed and have a bumper!
[141:59.53]I did it!
[142:00.48]I did it!
[142:01.20]I did it!
[142:01.52]I did it!
[142:01.76]I did it!
[142:02.06]I did it!
[142:02.32]I did it!
[142:02.90]I did it!
[142:03.28]I did it!
[142:03.48]I did it!
[142:03.72]I did it!
[142:04.30]I did it!
[142:04.60]I did it!
[142:04.86]I did it!

[142:35.15]I've already fucking lost my place.
[142:36.85]And then, I don't know.
[142:40.00]I don't, I don't, I forget.
[142:41.96]I forget already.
[142:44.34]I'm gonna eat my fucking hand.

[142:48.30]I don't even care.
[142:50.02]I have to, I'm gonna eat my fucking hand.
[142:51.52]Put it in the oven.
[142:53.36]No, my God.
[142:54.50]I'm not pretending.
[142:55.60]I'm not.
[142:56.06]I swear to God.

[143:13.54]I'm tilting a little.
[143:14.66]Tilt.

[143:29.48]Kill them.
[143:30.14]Kill them.
[143:30.98]Kill them.

[144:29.71]You followed me, so I'm going back home now.

[145:19.33]That's why I can't explode!
[145:21.41]You see that?
[145:21.98]You see that button right there?
[145:23.40]How it's made out of the most slippery fucking plastic note, man?
[145:27.18]You see that button?
[145:28.68]You see that shiny, plastic-ass fucking A button?
[145:50.22]cranky wanky right uh too many good ones there were a lot this year there's a lot of bad ones uh but there can only be one winner and I could have guessed this was going to be the one that wins this is also uh not only does this win worst meltdown of the year it also takes the cake for being the longest stream I've ever done and ever will
[146:14.91]Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers.
[146:16.95]That was a 13.4, 13 and a half hour stream.
[146:21.08]It was hell from start to finish.
[146:25.30]With 24% of the vote.
[146:26.56]Lord of the Rings, Two Towers.
[146:29.18]Underneath that, you have Super Monkey Ball with 19% and then Super Mario Sunshine at 17.7%.
[146:35.78]Cranky wanky.
[146:41.01]So there are your winners for Worst Meltdown.
[146:44.15]And now...
[146:46.64]We got another match.
[146:48.34]Let's move over to the WWE game.
[146:52.10]Match number four of the evening.
[146:56.97]This one, you will be able to bet on.
[146:59.73]I will just make that really clear.
[147:00.75]Let me just send the mods what they need to get.
[147:04.07]You will be able to bet on this one.
[147:05.19]Let me just tell the mods who it is.
[147:21.41]I had to write that like six times.
[147:24.76]Okay, so this is a one-on-one.
[147:26.02]This is going to be a one-on-one backstage brawl from what I have heard.
[147:34.12]Someone's going all in, all in.
[147:35.32]Oh, be careful.
[147:36.60]Be careful.
[147:40.18]One-on-one backstage brawl.
[147:45.21]Between none other than... Well, you're just going to have to see, aren't you?
[147:50.82]Just going to have to wait and see for it to load.
[147:55.47]And I will turn it back on.
[147:58.61]I will tell you that this is two very powerful beings.
[148:02.75]We have one of the most powerful current memes on the channel versus the potentially most powerful being on the channel.
[148:08.74]We're going to have to see.
[148:16.43]Why don't we take a look right now?
[148:23.81]Uh... Wait, what?
[148:25.73]They didn't even... They didn't even do it in the entrances!
[148:29.21]That's... That's Jerva Dump Truck versus Jex in a one-on-one backstage brawl?
[148:37.00]This is like in a horror movie.
[148:43.00]The Dump Truck versus Jex.
[148:47.38]I don't know why they're out back and why he's just murdering him out back.
[148:52.93]Start the prediction, please.
[148:53.95]Who do you think is gonna win this match?
[148:57.32]Why are they in some weird?
[148:58.68]German dump truck seems to have all right into the table.
[149:10.33]I Hope they use the outhouse to their advantage
[149:14.01]Dex wearing his Jax suit, which gives him plus 25.
[149:18.19]He's already through the table.
[149:20.25]You have a dump truck just dumping on Jax through the table.
[149:25.01]Jax, he got so fucked up, he's got gray hair now.
[149:28.79]What?
[149:29.87]You just broke his neck?
[149:32.25]You didn't even have time to... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[149:36.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[149:50.81]Oh my god, dude.
[149:52.33]You have to end it.
[149:54.31]You have to end it.
[149:57.39]It's the easiest way now.
[150:00.49]So many of you guys just got so screwed.
[150:03.03]You guys got so screwed.
[150:05.98]It happened too fast.
[150:07.16]You got destroyed.
[150:11.60]Oh my god.
[150:12.40]I can't.
[150:13.02]What am I supposed to do about that?
[150:14.18]Some of you guys just got absolutely decimated right there.
[150:20.84]oh my god that's so funny um okay I can't all right that's one I kind of I just I kind of want to see it again oh wait hold on we'll go back we'll go back and do a regular match after we'll do a regular match after I can't refund he lost you guys don't accept anymore
[150:49.24]Uh, do you pay out?
[150:50.10]I mean... Alright, no, no, pull it out, pull it out.
[150:54.29]Send the money back.
[150:55.19]Send the money back.
[150:55.91]Send the money back.
[150:56.77]Send the money back, I think.
[150:58.01]I don't know.
[150:58.67]I have no idea.
[150:59.29]This is a horrible scenario.
[151:02.67]No, pay it out.
[151:03.45]Pay it out.
[151:03.91]Pay it out.
[151:04.33]Pay it out.
[151:04.83]Pay it out.
[151:05.27]Pay it out.
[151:05.71]Pay it out.
[151:08.29]What happened?
[151:08.73]Did it do payout?
[151:13.49]Shit, I don't know, dude.
[151:16.66]I don't know.
[151:17.28]I don't know.
[151:17.82]It was because people could still vote.
[151:22.12]All right.
[151:22.88]Listen.
[151:23.62]Listen.
[151:23.89]Okay.
[151:24.11]Listen.
[151:24.33]Listen.
[151:24.73]Listen.
[151:26.13]We're gonna... All right.
[151:27.35]Listen.
[151:28.27]We're gonna refund the money.
[151:29.95]We're gonna refund the money, and we're gonna do it again.
[151:37.52]It happened too fast, dude.
[151:39.54]Oh, it fade out.
[151:41.78]Okay, well, now that you saw that, it's time for a rematch.
[151:45.40]It's too late.
[151:45.96]Okay, well, whatever.
[151:47.12]Look, that shit's going to happen.
[151:50.10]Hey, all you guys that just lost right there, here you go.
[151:53.95]You've got another opportunity because we're going to do another prediction right now.
[151:56.37]We're going to do another one right now.
[152:00.21]Same match.
[152:00.91]You know what just happened.
[152:01.93]Do you think he can do it again?
[152:09.02]Dump truck is too powerful.
[152:11.06]Is he, though?
[152:16.47]There's like errors on predictions.
[152:20.39]Whatever.
[152:26.34]Are we ready to do another prediction though?
[152:27.52]You guys, let's do it again.
[152:29.54]This is for a German dump truck versus Jax.
[152:32.30]Same place.
[152:32.74]I'm going to give you time now.
[152:44.09]So you have an opportunity here if you think that jump truck is going to do that again.
[152:47.89]Or if Jex is going to snap out of it here.
[152:50.00]Lose a little bit of that gray hair.
[152:52.46]And go for it.
[152:52.94]What do you guys think?
[153:01.98]We're going to close the prediction here.
[153:03.24]In about... I'd say a minute.
[153:08.98]One minute.
[153:09.30]We can maybe close it out.
[153:11.66]You guys all know what's going to happen.
[153:18.17]So are we ready?
[153:20.50]Are we ready to close it?
[153:21.16]Have you made your bets?
[153:24.60]All right.
[153:26.76]Close that up.
[153:27.26]I'm going to start it right now.
[153:36.23]Okay.
[153:36.53]Are we closed?
[153:37.05]Am I safe?
[153:40.57]Press this button.
[153:46.55]It has to run down the timer.
[153:48.07]Oh.
[153:51.33]All right.
[153:51.59]Well, I don't think that's going to happen again.
[153:53.19]So I think we have, I think we're good.
[153:54.51]I'm going to wait till it gets down to like a third.
[153:59.01]Okay.
[154:03.93]Now I'm like scared.
[154:04.90]Okay.
[154:05.16]Ready?
[154:05.50]In three, two, one.
[154:08.30]Go.
[154:15.41]Rematch.
[154:16.59]Right off the bat, Jex with a clothesline.
[154:18.41]All you have to do, you have to kill your opponent.
[154:21.29]All you guys that just bet against Jex.
[154:24.68]Oh, I don't know.
[154:25.42]You still have an opportunity betting against Butt.
[154:27.86]We saw Dump Truck kill him in two moves.
[154:32.82]Just carrying him and dropping him directly onto his big bulbous Bunger Burger Butt.
[154:41.67]That doesn't hurt him very much.
[154:42.53]Going over to the trash can here.
[154:44.27]Picking up a sludge hammer.
[154:45.93]Completely misses.
[154:49.71]Ankle lock?
[154:50.23]No, no, no, no, no.
[154:51.15]He's going to... What is he going to do?
[154:53.41]Take him right in the chest.
[154:54.29]They're being a lot more timid this time.
[154:55.90]They're not, like, instantly hurting each other.
[154:57.50]So maybe this is better.
[155:00.72]Dump truck versus Jax.
[155:02.26]Right onto the sludge hammer.
[155:08.56]What was that sound?
[155:10.08]That was like somebody getting shocked with a taser.
[155:12.64]It's like a stun gun.
[155:14.37]Uh-oh.
[155:15.67]This does not look good for Jex.
[155:18.21]Remember, you just have to kill your opponent.
[155:21.51]With the steel!
[155:22.25]No, he didn't steal it, but he still hit him with it.
[155:26.07]That might have killed him.
[155:27.88]Nope, he's still alive.
[155:32.98]Jex has not even transformed, by the way, into Super Jex.
[155:35.06]He can only do that once every five years.
[155:38.08]He's hitting him with a skull.
[155:40.84]Big reversal by Jerma's dump truck.
[155:45.23]This looks pretty even.
[155:46.97]Look at those health bars.
[155:47.85]This isn't anybody's match right now.
[155:53.71]I would love to see an outhouse.
[155:54.71]I would love to see going over to the outhouse and just giving him a swirly.
[156:03.19]Punch.
[156:03.61]Right hand.
[156:04.25]No.
[156:04.59]Reversal.
[156:05.21]Right elbow.
[156:07.36]Triple elbow.
[156:08.14]He hit his head on one of those.
[156:09.50]He hit his head on one of those.
[156:12.08]He smashed his head on like a rock on one of those skulls.
[156:15.06]Completely missing a few times.
[156:16.54]Dump truck does not have eyes.
[156:17.93]He's just an ass.
[156:19.63]Remember, he has to go by smell.
[156:23.13]Yep, I just said that.
[156:24.41]I just did.
[156:25.61]And I apologize to 22,000 people.
[156:33.79]This is looking bad for Jex.
[156:34.97]That was a neckbreaker on the ground.
[156:36.11]The neckbreaker always is just deadly.
[156:39.51]Uh-oh.
[156:40.19]Jex is in a lot of trouble for the second time in a row unless he pulls something out right here.
[156:49.32]Can we get any momentum at all from Jex?
[156:51.20]He's just getting absolutely destroyed.
[156:52.86]His health is almost at zero.
[156:55.68]And he's going to... Ha ha ha!
[157:08.66]Jax seems to not... Man, maybe Jax is getting old, too.
[157:15.79]Oh, no.
[157:18.97]Is my ass more powerful than the rest of my body at peak pinnacle condition?
[157:25.49]That's what that whole bit was.
[157:26.79]Oh, well.
[157:32.30]Oh, that is it.
[157:32.80]That's another win back-to-back there from Derma's dump truck.
[157:40.11]Time to bring out super jacks.
[157:42.99]Who's screaming?
[157:45.07]All right.
[157:45.93]That is going to take us, guys, to... Let me lower this.
[157:52.10]We have the final four categories.
[157:54.18]They're pretty big ones.
[157:56.88]We have worst gamer moment, best gamer moment, worst stream of the year, and best stream of the year.
[158:03.73]Coming up.
[158:05.41]These are the bottom four categories for the awards, at least.
[158:11.78]And some of these are pretty close from what I remember.
[158:15.00]Yeah.
[158:16.90]So let's start with... Hold on.
[158:18.62]Move this out of the way.
[158:22.04]I'm working on it.
[158:22.90]Relax.
[158:25.72]We're going to start with worst gamer moment.
[158:31.98]Go over here.
[158:34.68]Did it pay out?
[158:36.12]66 million channel points.
[158:38.30]My God.
[158:41.05]66 fucking million.
[158:45.72]Okay, pull this back here.
[158:48.40]I am back.
[158:50.18]Should I put the New Year thing on?
[158:51.14]Wait, wait, what time is it?
[158:52.06]Oh, we have one hour, right?
[158:53.18]In one hour, I think it's going to line up perfectly.
[158:57.80]Uh, Worst Gamer Moment of the Year.
[159:00.72]This includes, um, just tasks I couldn't do, bosses I couldn't beat, things I couldn't do, basic, uh, basic, literal human, basic human instruction, uh, not being able to follow.
[159:13.73]So it's, um, just really, really bad, shitty gameplay and ideas that I have over the years.

[159:58.68]No, Omega Symbol, for real.
[159:59.88]I don't know what that is.
[160:00.80]I have no idea what that is.
[160:02.23]No, you know what a fucking Omega Symbol is.
[160:03.71]Let's do the other symbols.
[160:04.39]I have no idea.
[160:04.91]The God of War Symbol, you motherfucker!
[160:07.05]I don't know what the God... I played like the first four hours.

[161:05.12]Get this away from my house!
[161:33.74]Oh shit, it did work.
[161:34.76]All right, just make the jump.
[161:37.16]I gotta make this jump.
[161:37.90]This is the biggest jump of the day.
[161:39.08]So loud.
[161:39.90]Just a regular jump.
[161:40.70]Nothing crazy.
[161:41.34]Just a regular jump.
[161:42.62]It gets close.
[161:44.98]Right there.
[161:45.42]Bingo.
[161:46.00]Just land.
[161:46.86]Holy shit.

[161:54.30]What?
[161:54.90]What?
[161:55.59]What?
[161:56.19]Why?
[161:56.79]What?
[161:57.09]Nice.
[162:06.39]Ride the wall.
[162:14.88]I don't care.
[162:24.39]Is that 8?
[162:26.09]855?
[162:26.11]855?
[162:26.29]835?
[162:26.35]God damn it, man.
[162:39.36]What time is that?
[162:42.86]What time is this son of a shit?
[162:45.52]8... This is 8.35
[163:07.81]People think that there's no way that that's real, and I swear to God it was.
[163:12.96]The winner of worst gamer moment of the year is going to be... Let me get the audio.
[163:20.46]Read a clock right now.
[163:24.18]Don't do this to me.
[163:26.04]Don't do this to me right now.
[163:27.06]Don't do this to me now, bro.
[163:28.95]Don't do this to me now, bro.
[163:33.01]Don't do this to me right now, bro.
[163:35.15]Don't do it.
[163:35.61]Don't... Don't...
[163:37.90]Give me a clock.
[163:38.42]Let's go.
[163:39.58]Give me a clock right now.
[163:42.24]Give me a clock.
[163:42.70]Let's see it.
[163:43.02]Let's see a clock.
[163:43.90]We got an analog clock with a time on it.
[163:45.52]Let me see it.
[163:46.10]Link me it.
[163:48.64]Somebody link a clock.
[163:55.55]Look at the clock.
[163:57.09]You think... I'm a millennial.
[163:59.09]I don't have an analog clock in my house.
[164:01.07]I have an iPhone.
[164:04.99]Here we go.
[164:10.94]Okay.
[164:11.66]Large online clock.
[164:15.22]And let me save that image.
[164:19.98]Okay.
[164:20.26]Now I'm going to read this.
[164:21.60]I'm going to read this analog clock right now.
[164:32.14]This clock says... Okay.
[164:37.83]Okay.
[164:40.87]This is... That is 8.05.
[164:43.33]8.05 o'clock.
[164:46.09]What do you mean I cheated?
[164:55.83]Wait, it's 8.05 right now.
[165:04.04]What?
[165:06.62]Wait, what the fuck is happening?
[165:09.16]Where did I get this from?
[165:10.36]Somebody linked this image.
[165:20.62]All right, that's it.
[165:21.22]Stream's over.
[165:22.22]Stream is ending right now.
[165:25.76]Go back to the awards.
[165:26.90]No, I've... All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[165:29.35]Worst gamer moment of the year.
[165:39.60]49% of the vote, it was an absolute landslide.
[165:42.16]A $2.5 billion miss.
[165:46.38]With 49% of the vote, an absolute landslide.
[165:51.36]In second place, it was Can't Read an Analog Clock for 10.8% of the vote.
[165:56.81]And then 1DPI Andy for 9.8% of the vote.
[166:02.33]The debt, by the way, I believe has increased since that happened.
[166:10.27]So with every worst moment, we also have a best moment, right?
[166:14.24]You can't have the worst without having the best.
[166:16.62]Here come the nominees for best gamer moment of the year.
[166:19.82]And you know, it's supposed to be gamer moments.
[166:24.68]If I can't read an analog clock, that's not a gamer moment.
[166:27.22]That's me having the intelligence quotient of a four-year-old.
[166:33.45]Right?
[166:36.59]Here are the nominees.
[166:39.25]Best gamer moment of the year!
[166:40.58]There you go, Satan.
[166:48.10]It's time for you...
[167:09.15]I'm gonna die!
[167:10.59]I'm gonna die!
[167:11.59]Yeah, I'm not... It's stupid.
[167:16.31]You've got the biggest heart of anyone I know.
[167:22.43]Look at love in the dictionary, and there's your picture.
[167:29.45]Okay, here we go.
[167:42.64]Get fucking decimated.
[167:44.30]Get absolutely decimated.
[167:45.86]I don't even know what your name was.
[167:47.54]I'm not even going to read it.
[167:48.98]I'm not even going to read it.
[167:50.06]That was like I was about to get into a car accident.
[167:57.65]I got him!
[167:59.41]It's two hands, but I have to press this to move out of the way.
[168:05.19]Use both hands and foot.
[168:07.45]It's my chin.
[168:15.02]I'm getting tired!
[168:15.78]It's tiring me.
[168:27.23]Well, I understand.
[168:29.57]Whoa!
[168:31.29]Whoa!
[168:32.61]Whoa!
[168:34.07]Whoa!
[168:40.37]Was I supposed to jump?
[168:42.77]Holy shit!
[168:44.79]Somebody said, this is not impressive at all.
[168:47.45]It's like a regular level.
[168:49.73]I'm good.
[168:53.96]What are you doing?
[169:01.58]What's that record on that level?
[169:02.53]What's the record on that level?
[169:03.35]I want it.
[169:03.75]What's the world record on that level?
[169:05.15]Without terms of system plots.
[169:09.55]One, two, three, four.
[169:18.92]I think that's a fucking huge moment right there.
[169:20.90]And then they're going to wrap around.
[169:22.74]Okay, I got it.
[169:23.24]Ready?
[169:23.52]Three, two, one, go.
[169:29.52]Okay, here they come.
[169:32.59]Oh, shit.
[169:33.09]Oh, my God.
[169:44.73]Slow doesn't count.
[169:48.69]It's over on a tower!
[169:50.19]I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[169:52.94]Shit, this is gonna be a really hard one.
[169:55.36]Uh, there's no T's either.
[169:56.80]Uh, does anyone want to start with W?
[169:58.40]Uh, yes, yes, it's true, that could be, could be that.
[170:02.36]I got it.
[170:03.10]The word was world.
[170:04.20]Okay.
[170:04.76]Uh, Simon says.
[170:05.82]What the fuck?
[170:06.60]Okay, Simon says.
[170:11.02]Whoa!
[170:14.57]Get it!
[170:15.27]Get up!
[170:16.41]It's okay!
[170:16.83]Your knee is gonna be fine, honey!
[170:18.75]Your knee is gonna be fine, honey!
[170:20.21]He's got one HP!
[170:30.80]Come on!
[170:33.16]Come on!
[170:38.30]With all of your destructive power!
[170:48.94]Okay.
[171:10.32]So somebody made a pretty good point, which is actually very funny.
[171:13.66]Half of those moments are just sort of normal things that like a good gamer could do.
[171:18.79]But for us, it's spectacular.
[171:25.47]The winner of best gamer moment of the year.
[171:28.37]I'm going to pat myself on the back for this one.
[171:32.65]I think I did pretty well in the streams.
[171:34.61]Two of them, right?
[171:36.38]The winner is...
[171:41.36]Hades.
[171:42.90]Beating Hades.
[171:44.24]Not beating Hades, right.
[171:45.94]Killing Hades, the boss, on my third attempt.
[171:49.84]That was 26.6% of the vote.
[171:51.68]I mean, I think, come on.
[171:53.17]That's worth a little bit of celebration.
[171:55.47]Just a little.
[171:57.73]26.6%.
[171:58.53]And then Rhythm Heaven Shooter Pog was 14.9%.
[172:01.43]Also, I think I got to give myself some credit for that one.
[172:03.99]And then Binding of Isaac God Build to kill Mega Satan with 10.8% of the vote was in third place.
[172:15.25]Chat sucks at Hades.
[172:22.72]We have the final two categories here before the Rumble, and we have about 45 minutes before the ball drops in New York.
[172:30.49]Perfect timing because everybody is from New York on the Rumble, so that's good.
[172:34.49]The last two categories of the year are worst stream of the year and best stream of the year.
[172:43.13]to categories that could be a lot in them.
[172:47.30]I don't want to accidentally leak who wins.
[172:49.02]So we're going to start with worst stream of the year.
[172:51.80]There's a few I could think of, but I don't want to spoil anything for those that may not have seen.
[172:58.16]So here we go.
[172:59.08]Here comes the worst streams that I did in 2020, according to you.
[173:19.04]Am I supposed to kill these guys?
[173:20.64]Oh shit!
[173:21.10]I think it just needed a few minutes to load.
[173:23.69]Dude, this looks fine.
[173:42.32]I'll be back.
[173:42.84]Give me five minutes.
[173:43.78]Fucking turn the computer.
[173:44.66]I'm just turning the computer off.
[173:45.52]I'm not even going to turn the stream off.
[173:46.58]I'm just turning off the computer.
[173:47.88]I'm restarting.
[173:48.88]I can't even restart my computer.
[173:57.79]Okay.
[173:58.97]Don't buy this game.
[174:01.29]This is horrible.
[174:02.05]Yes, I know.
[174:02.85]This game is absolute utter dog shit.
[174:06.32]I know, but I'm at disc four and I'm going to win.
[174:11.59]No, I have to go back on full disc!
[174:15.37]I can't!
[174:16.01]I don't remember.
[174:16.90]I don't remember.
[174:18.68]Can you imagine making this game?
[174:20.68]Oh, just stop talking shit and just do it.
[174:23.42]I'm telling you right now, I'm not going back and doing this shit again.
[174:26.64]I would rather eat my own hand.
[174:27.94]I'd rather you cut my fucking hand off and put it in the oven and cook it at like 350 for two hours, and I eat it on stream.
[174:34.21]I'd rather do that than go back and do the last 45 minutes.
[174:39.01]Jeremy, you can't play Beautiful Joe.
[174:41.31]You haven't played VR in so long.
[174:43.07]Why won't you play VR?
[174:44.37]Beautiful Joe goes brr.
[174:47.53]Okay, I have to pay attention.
[174:49.05]Why do you guys hate this game?
[174:53.86]Why does everybody hate this?
[174:55.88]This game is fun and exciting and there's characters in it.
[174:58.84]Why do you guys hate this game?
[175:00.52]Do you want me to do it again?
[175:14.40]Just kill them!
[175:16.10]Kill them!
[175:17.31]Kill them!
[175:18.17]Kill them!
[175:18.53]No!
[175:18.83]Get this away from my house!
[175:47.83]He's training Psyquit, somebody's dead!
[175:50.93]Wait, what?!
[175:53.12]No, it's the tournament!
[175:55.18]Don't kill each other!
[175:56.08]Okay, if a stream is the worst stream of 2020, guaranteed.
[176:01.72]We can remove it from the list, right?
[176:02.96]Like, everything else is an honorable mention at this point, right?
[176:06.28]Oh shit, I fell through the world!
[176:09.48]Oh shi-
[176:15.27]No!
[176:15.45]Please tell me you can see this.
[176:17.88]I'm killing everybody.
[176:19.58]Irma's torturing his fans.
[176:24.12]I keep laughing too much today.
[176:26.72]I'm gonna be in pain.
[176:31.76]Somebody likes this here.
[176:33.92]Somebody likes this.
[176:34.56]I know they do.
[176:34.92]Alright, my tongue's fucking fucked up.
[176:37.50]Come on, say it!
[176:38.08]Oh my god.
[176:39.57]MonkaS.
[176:41.43]Minus 300 viewers?
[176:43.67]Muggerhead!
[176:45.47]600 people left, it's my fault.
[176:49.13]No, that's on them.
[176:51.73]Guys, for all you know, 600 people just got, like, a fucking call.
[176:54.59]And they had to get on a phone call.
[176:55.86]They had to go to, like, the doctor or something.
[176:57.38]Or they had to go and eat dinner.
[176:59.02]Or they had to go to bed.
[177:00.48]You don't know it's my fault.
[177:01.64]I had nothing to do with it.
[177:10.08]So yes, so hold on, there we go.
[177:12.80]So yes, sometimes I have bad streams.
[177:16.75]Sometimes.
[177:18.25]They can't all be good ones.
[177:20.39]They can't all be good.
[177:22.47]Sometimes you have to have a couple of stinkers.
[177:25.45]But by... No, you don't.
[177:28.19]Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes.
[177:30.05]Sometimes.
[177:30.61]I'm going to let that slide.
[177:39.13]It's your birthday.
[177:41.59]The winner of the worst stream of the entire year of 2020.
[177:44.47]I mean, okay, if it's the worst game of 2020, does that matter?
[177:52.24]Does that actually matter too?
[177:55.34]Like, what if it's the worst fucking game that came out in 2020?
[177:57.02]Watch Dogs Legion.
[177:59.28]At 38.5% of the vote, Watch Dogs Legion...
[178:06.87]Took that by a lot, but the Die Dallas Encounter was at 31%.
[178:13.41]So really like almost 70% of the entire vote was those two streams.
[178:18.88]So you have to imagine that those are probably the worst ones.
[178:23.08]FTK2 was there at 13.2%, way lower than the 31 from Die Dallas Encounter.
[178:29.04]So 70% of you thought those two.
[178:32.76]I could probably agree.
[178:39.16]You did Tearless after Watchdog.
[178:42.08]You did Tearless after Watchdog.
[178:46.28]Did I?
[178:46.66]But only like a few minutes though, right?
[178:50.74]An upset.
[178:51.18]Well, then it's Die Dallas Encounter.
[178:52.42]That's the next one.
[178:54.29]All right.
[178:55.39]We've made it to the final category of the evening.
[178:58.35]And it's the big one.
[179:00.27]It's the one that's worth all the money.
[179:02.27]This one's worth all the cash, all the money.
[179:05.51]Best stream of the year.
[179:09.59]I'm going to peek.
[179:13.87]Might surprise a lot of you.
[179:16.27]This is probably going to surprise a lot of people here.
[179:17.99]There's going to be a lot of people that might be angry.
[179:19.59]A lot of people that might be upset at what has happened here.
[179:26.36]We'll see.
[179:27.74]It was very contested.
[179:29.04]We'll just say that.
[179:31.00]Here are your nominees for best stream of the year.
[179:47.44]Hey, German on 85 here.
[179:48.67]Stop moving.
[179:51.71]Stop.
[179:52.15]No.
[179:52.21]I don't want to kick it.
[179:54.81]Trying to keep my eye on the road, son.
[180:07.83]Son, we got a problem here.
[180:10.29]Son, oh, son.
[180:12.55]Is that the new waiter that we just hired?
[180:14.28]I think it is.
[180:17.80]Pulling the car.
[180:19.50]Fuck, okay.
[180:25.86]Yeah, when you guys come back, remember, it's me, the fat fuck IRL.
[180:32.54]Come back next week and I'll shake my stomach around for you boy after drinking three Gatorades.
[180:38.31]Alright, now let's play a fun game called Chase Me.
[180:51.37]I'm not the dog.
[180:52.13]This is not like dog- I'm not the dog if you just got in here like a minute ago.
[180:55.63]Sometimes we do this.
[181:01.59]And he'll just sit here all day and stare at my face.
[181:04.71]Hey!
[181:11.19]I need a new trailer!
[181:20.42]Okay, yes.
[181:21.68]We're gonna get you that new trailer.
[181:24.52]Come on.
[181:25.42]Hey.
[181:27.36]Jimmy the fish sends his regards.
[181:30.38]And the fish family.
[181:32.20]I can't do it.
[181:32.94]I'll do it.
[181:33.32]I'm a 30.
[181:38.13]Oh shit!
[181:39.63]I have to stand here.
[181:41.29]This is a hand he's gonna bust on.
[181:42.47]He's gonna bust on it.
[181:45.04]Oh my god, no, no.
[181:48.62]I just puked a shot out of my mouth.
[181:53.70]I'm all right, I'm okay.
[181:56.00]Mr. Green, you can't just throw up on the table.
[181:57.72]I know I can't.
[181:58.18]Somebody will come help me.
[182:02.00]Mr. Green, you can't take your shirt off.
[182:03.60]Just give me a second.
[182:04.54]I'm just going to hold it.
[182:06.62]I'm going to hold it.
[182:08.25]No, no, no, no.
[182:08.83]It's blue.
[182:09.81]It's blue.
[182:10.05]What do you mean it's blue?
[182:12.55]It's just blue.
[182:13.25]Oh, God.
[182:13.53]Did it say FRK?
[182:15.47]Fuck it.
[182:15.77]Fuck it.
[182:16.43]Don't do that.
[182:18.15]Okay, press and hold it.
[182:21.72]I've got an Omega Symbol.
[182:22.73]I don't know what that is.
[182:24.21]I don't know what that is.
[182:25.11]Seriously, I'm not kidding.
[182:26.19]I don't fucking know what that is.
[182:27.23]No, Omega Symbol, for real.
[182:28.43]I don't know what that is.
[182:29.83]I have no idea what that is.
[182:30.77]No, you know what a fucking Omega Symbol is.
[182:32.15]Just do the other symbols.
[182:32.85]I have no idea.
[182:33.61]The God of War symbol, you motherfucker!
[182:36.60]I played the first four hours of God of War.
[182:38.86]I played the first four hours of God of War.
[182:41.30]That wasn't in the God of War game.
[182:42.22]Fucking Quake symbol!
[182:43.60]Upside-down Quake symbol!
[182:45.56]I don't know what all the video game symbols are.
[182:48.30]Fucking Trident!
[182:49.98]I'm gonna lose!
[182:51.65]Oh my god!
[182:52.97]Oh my god!
[182:54.13]I just broke something!
[182:56.99]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[182:59.85]Yeah, Roger, I'm up here in the Channel 5 News chapter.
[183:03.46]And we're getting word that there seems to be some type of altercation going on outside of the McDonald's.
[183:10.58]Not entirely sure exactly why this is starting.
[183:15.68]But I'm getting sources in my ear right now that apparently somebody threw a McChicken out the window.
[183:45.13]Get it, get up, it's okay, your knee is gonna be fine, honey.
[183:48.61]Your knee is gonna be fine, honey.
[183:54.40]Okay, okay, turn it off.
[183:57.98]Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[184:03.74]I'm gonna smash something.
[184:08.94]I'll take a large number 9, please.
[184:20.80]Alright, I gotta go all the way around.
[184:38.67]Why are you running?
[184:40.29]Why are you running?
[184:43.73]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[184:47.69]Oh my god!
[184:49.73]Okay, I'm sitting here with the mic being black.
[184:56.77]What's the context of the memes in the background?
[185:01.95]I forget, during Mario Sunshine, why was that happening?
[185:04.96]Like the, open up, like the, why are you running?
[185:07.80]What was I doing that for?
[185:08.62]Oh, it's autoplay because I was jingling the keys.
[185:12.24]Right, okay, right, right, right, right.
[185:13.63]Well, anyways.
[185:18.63]The best stream of the year, apparently.
[185:20.51]Oh, this is going to be contested.
[185:23.35]People are not going to be happy about this.
[185:26.11]Well, let's just see what happens.
[185:28.31]The best stream of the year goes to...
[185:36.04]Wait, wait, wait.
[185:36.42]Play the drums.
[185:36.78]Play the drums first.
[185:37.30]With 27.4% of the vote, Long Drive is the winner of the best stream of the year.
[186:04.96]Beating the Autostream with 19.2% of the vote.
[186:12.58]Beating all those.
[186:13.96]Those two beat Casino Inc.
[186:15.75]at 11.7%.
[186:16.41]11.7% for Casino Inc.
[186:19.61]They're your top three.
[186:21.53]The Autostream didn't win.
[186:24.87]A lot of people thought that was going to happen.
[186:28.34]Long Drive with 27.4%.
[186:29.10]And I learned something about this channel.
[186:34.26]Gotta play more games with just fucking cars in them.
[186:41.03]Just need to be able to drive a car.
[186:45.89]Right up to the top of the list.
[186:50.56]Casino Inc.
[186:51.06]in third.
[186:51.44]I was surprised by that.
[186:52.18]I was.
[186:55.38]So that's it for the New Year's Awards.
[186:57.88]But we now have the main event of the evening.
[187:02.11]What we're about to do right now is finish the Germa Rumble 2020 with the actual rumble.
[187:10.11]30 participants.
[187:12.59]The first rumble that has been on this channel in like two or three years.
[187:16.45]And I'm really happy that it could be done and be here for you guys to watch.
[187:20.65]Because I'm going to enjoy it too.
[187:21.96]I'm going to be watching right here.
[187:23.72]So let's take one more break before we're going to count the ball down to.
[187:26.51]We have like about 30 minutes.
[187:28.17]That might actually happen in the middle of the game.
[187:31.69]So we'll see.
[187:33.23]I'm going to be right back one more time.
[187:36.15]And when I come back, Rumble will begin.
[187:40.83]See you guys in just a few minutes.
[191:14.90]Okay.
[191:16.50]So, it is time for us to do the rumble.
[191:22.30]30 participants enter.
[191:25.03]Only one can win.
[191:28.35]Hope you're all prepared.
[191:29.35]Maybe gotten another snack or... And I got to actually pay attention here because the ball is probably going to drop in the middle of this rumble.
[191:35.91]So I need to be able to have like a timer out here.
[191:37.79]Here we go.
[191:42.13]Give me a clock.
[191:44.04]Alright, I have access to a clock.
[191:48.37]I do not want to show the game right now because it will spoil everything.
[191:52.27]So I'm not going to do that.
[191:57.03]I'm just going to turn it on.
[192:05.16]If I can, hold on a sec.
[192:09.48]I think I'm going to have to resize the window.
[192:11.48]Let's see.
[192:16.69]Oh, come on.
[192:19.79]There we go.
[192:20.37]Okay, I need to get down here and turn the volume up.
[192:22.03]Because you guys can't hear it.
[192:30.03]There we go.
[192:30.81]Okay.
[192:34.10]Alright, let's go.
[192:35.16]Are you ready?
[192:39.58]It is time.
[192:42.64]The time has come.
[192:48.10]For the rumble portion.
[192:54.40]I'm about to turn it on.
[192:57.98]In three, two, one.
[193:00.71]Here we go.
[193:03.95]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the wrestling portion.
[193:10.97]You know the rules.
[193:12.83]If you get thrown over the top rope, you are eliminated.
[193:19.67]There is no re-entry, and you have a random number.
[193:24.33]He will now explain everything I just explained.
[193:28.47]Superstars?
[193:29.01]He's not even talking.
[193:49.87]Animatron up here, and somebody's doing that from the booth upstairs.
[193:54.67]So who are the first two contestants in the 2020 Rumble?
[194:00.98]I don't know.
[194:01.40]We're about to find out.
[194:02.86]Oh, that would be the cheers to UCD.
[194:07.94]Gonna need some of that crowd.
[194:09.00]Hopefully he does a great job.
[194:13.28]He's really hoping that the crowd will get behind him.
[194:18.22]for a change not him needing to get behind other people with his audio tape cheers to you we believe in you we believe in you but you're number one so you probably won't do it I will be shocked if you do cheers to you good luck to you in this competition
[194:50.81]So who is number two?
[194:54.94]First two into the ring at the first moment of the rumble.
[195:06.29]Here it comes.
[195:09.15]Are you ready?
[195:13.26]They're looking for the next contestant.
[195:16.84]I don't know where the next contestant is.
[195:19.27]Why are they looking for the next contestant?
[195:21.37]They're supposed to come down... Well, no, everyone's excited.
[195:26.71]Of course they're excited.
[195:27.99]Because that's the McDLT briefcase guy.
[195:30.89]Hailing all the way from 1981.
[195:34.00]During the pinnacle of the McDLT.
[195:44.93]The guy in the front row that goes down, drops to one knee with a briefcase in his hand and looks over and says, cool, cool.
[195:51.33]Hot, hot.
[195:51.73]Incredibly powerful.
[195:55.29]And apparently incredibly sweaty.
[195:57.35]There's the McDLT briefcase guy.
[196:03.37]I'm talking quarter pound of beef.
[196:05.67]Why is he out of the ring?
[196:08.55]Did he just eliminate himself?
[196:20.77]There's a serial killer behind those eyes.
[196:23.05]Well, I don't know much about that.
[196:25.81]I just know that they're the two that start.
[196:30.70]USA.
[196:31.30]Here we go.
[196:31.90]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the German Rumble 2020.
[196:34.48]New Year's Eve.
[196:36.44]Don't look.
[196:36.88]Oh, come on.
[196:37.38]McDLT is my favorite character.
[196:39.30]McDLT guys are my favorite characters.
[196:40.58]Don't get eliminated instantly.
[196:41.92]Oh, my fucking God.
[196:43.14]What the fuck?
[196:44.55]What?
[196:45.89]why oh he's my favorite character favorite character somebody get it here and just eliminate cheers to you oh it's the pencil the pencil is in the 2020 rumba how is it possible the most hated character the pencil was in the rumba it's been like four years since we've seen the pencil
[197:10.12]And cheers to you.
[197:11.10]It just has so much power.
[197:13.28]So much strength.
[197:14.54]Nobody can even touch him so far.
[197:18.12]Oh my goodness.
[197:19.16]A huge clothesline onto the pencil.
[197:21.92]We're going to fill this ring up a little bit here.
[197:23.40]Someone's coming in at about 10 dots.
[197:24.56]Good.
[197:25.18]Sweeping kick to the groin there.
[197:28.02]Pencil has started to dominate.
[197:31.69]And of course, Glue Man coming in next.
[197:34.63]Glue Man is your number four.
[197:38.43]There he is.
[197:39.98]In all of his glory.
[197:41.56]With his Boston Celtics boots.
[197:44.21]As the pencil rakes his eyes.
[197:45.69]Glue Man now stuffed into the corner.
[197:47.83]Takes two or three punches.
[197:49.07]Didn't even get a chance to show everybody.
[197:50.29]Now he's going to reverse it.
[197:52.85]Cheers to you taking a breather here.
[197:54.63]After instantly eliminating my favorite character, can the pencil be removed?
[197:57.44]Pencil is a former champion of the Rumble, by the way.
[198:00.24]Really important for you to know.
[198:01.76]I think they're going to double team.
[198:04.00]They are not going to double team.
[198:08.42]Dr. Smoykson coming in next at number five.
[198:11.43]As they're going to... Oh.
[198:13.65]What?
[198:15.09]No, that doesn't count.
[198:16.53]Is Glue Man eliminated?
[198:19.23]What's going on?
[198:21.55]What the fuck?
[198:24.81]Okay.
[198:25.25]Glue Man is not eliminated.
[198:28.21]Dr. Smoykson comes in.
[198:29.19]We now got four competitors into the rumble.
[198:31.47]A lot of you guys probably would hate to see the pencil win again.
[198:33.67]So would I.
[198:37.35]The crowded ring.
[198:38.37]Here it comes.
[198:39.62]Who is going to be number six?
[198:44.42]Toss him over.
[198:45.32]Toss him over.
[198:45.82]Oh, it's Jermahing.
[198:47.77]Jermahing.
[198:48.65]Oh, fucking cool, man.
[198:51.27]Jermahing coming in from the game The Thing.
[198:54.60]See if we can get a good view of his face.
[198:57.76]Glue Man, you're never going to win, man.
[199:00.64]Glue Man's just never going to win.
[199:02.92]We all have to be completely honest with ourselves.
[199:05.08]He's just, he's a lovable loser.
[199:07.50]I'm sorry, Glue Man.
[199:09.38]It doesn't matter if I give you 100 in every stat.
[199:11.70]You're going to get thrown out in the first five minutes.
[199:15.80]CheersToYou is still holding strong.
[199:17.60]While Jermahing...
[199:20.48]Maybe not for long, though.
[199:21.48]We'll see.
[199:23.42]I can't believe I'm seeing... I cannot believe what I'm seeing right now.
[199:26.96]Gabe Newell is coming in next, and they're going to double-team eliminate him, possibly.
[199:31.42]Cheers to you, looking... And he's got a Valve Index on.
[199:33.90]He didn't... Instantly eliminates Dr. Smirks, and Gabe Newell is back, and he is angry for not being invited for the last three or four years in a row.
[199:42.64]Showing off that Index.
[199:45.03]Dr. Smirks taking a huge... Oh, what is he doing?
[199:49.44]Dr. Smoysen just breathes in his own hand.
[199:51.99]Okay, that was weird.
[199:53.35]But Gabe Newell is looking for redemption in this rumble.
[199:57.51]If you remember, The Pencil and Gabe Newell had a huge rivalry, and it looks like it's going to continue here as he gets dropped onto the top turnbuckle there.
[200:05.62]Number eight coming in is Jigsaw with the gas.
[200:09.42]The Jigsaw Doll.
[200:11.60]Dermathing on the edge of the ropes there.
[200:13.30]Dermathing's going to get eliminated.
[200:14.28]Oh, he's not.
[200:15.11]He holds on for his dear life.
[200:19.06]Pencil is going to eliminate.
[200:20.56]Oh, it's going to... I can't see him.
[200:24.77]Come on.
[200:26.27]We didn't get to see his face.
[200:28.83]Cheers to you is still in it.
[200:30.47]He was the first competitor, by the way.
[200:33.35]He got instantly gassed.
[200:35.33]He's coming in exit number nine.
[200:36.79]We got Pac-Man.
[200:38.74]Pac-Man has entered the Rumble.
[200:41.14]Pac-Man.
[200:49.82]Gabe Newell is still doing very well.
[200:55.20]Still got good green health.
[200:58.05]If I were him, I would go over in that corner, I would open up Half-Life Alyx, and I would start Chapter 1.
[201:03.15]What a great game that was, and what a great thing, going after Pac-Man's back here.
[201:07.41]We're gonna have six competitors in the ring, and of course, Long Drive Dad is gonna make an appearance.
[201:16.22]He won Best Stream of the Year.
[201:19.36]Why wouldn't Long Drive Dad make an appearance?
[201:25.41]Can he sweep another category called Winning the Rumble?
[201:30.49]Big DDT there.
[201:35.03]The ring's getting crowded.
[201:36.13]Yeah, it is.
[201:36.65]Cheers to you.
[201:37.43]Still in it.
[201:39.69]Big right hook onto Long Drive.
[201:41.85]Are they going to fill more people in here?
[201:44.11]Do not let this rivalry end this way, Gabe.
[201:46.71]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[201:47.97]It can't end like this.
[201:49.66]It can't end like this.
[201:52.30]Oh, Gabe Newell holds on for dear life as Travis Touchdown comes in.
[201:58.75]Making his way in.
[202:01.57]Can't wait for that new game.
[202:02.57]Going to be playing that new game as Travis Touchdown comes on in.
[202:05.59]Cheers to you.
[202:06.57]Cheers to you.
[202:07.53]It's gone.
[202:09.92]Long Drive Dad has eliminated, cheers to you, the longest person inside of the ring so far.
[202:14.68]He made it 30% of the way through.
[202:17.80]But sorry, he didn't win.
[202:21.05]Now Gabe Newell has got Long Drive Dad.
[202:22.77]Gives him the groin drop.
[202:24.35]Long Drive Dad's going to get tossed out by Gabe Newell.
[202:27.89]He's got extra strength so far.
[202:29.45]And who's coming in now?
[202:32.23]Fortnite Jimmy's coming in next.
[202:38.85]Fortnite Jimmy on his way in as Gabe Newell and The Pencil both try to eliminate Long Drive Dad.
[202:50.30]We were talking shit and he's ready to go.
[202:52.78]It doesn't matter.
[202:53.40]I mean, it doesn't matter.
[202:55.32]I mean, he's only 13 and he really shouldn't be in here with a bunch of grown like 44 year olds and like 29 year olds, but like whatever, it's okay.
[203:08.43]It's a full ring right now.
[203:10.71]Reversal by Jerma Thing onto Jerma Pencil.
[203:12.91]That's not a Jerma Pencil.
[203:13.89]That's just the pencil.
[203:14.71]He sucks.
[203:17.90]No eliminations.
[203:19.40]Somebody has to get eliminated.
[203:23.50]That's a fake-out from Jerma Thing, if I've ever seen one.
[203:26.08]I told you.
[203:28.93]Long Drive Dad's going out right here.
[203:30.87]No, he got distracted by Travis Touchdown.
[203:32.57]Long Drive lives again.
[203:33.99]Just see another minute here.
[203:38.18]Fortnite Jimmy, like in math class, threw his pencil down after getting a 100 on it.
[203:44.56]Long Drive Dad, he's dealt with, he has kids of his own.
[203:49.48]He's upset about that one.
[203:51.64]Here's a dad, for God's sake.
[203:53.68]No, he can't eliminate him.
[203:56.10]As Jerma985 enters the arena, but no, Long Drive Dad cannot eliminate Fortnite Jimmy, but Jerma, Jerma with a full body cast on.
[204:06.25]2020's been a little rough on Jerma985, but he still has got the strength of at least 10 people.
[204:13.16]He still has the strength.
[204:15.90]Long drive, Dad.
[204:16.68]Long drive, Dad.
[204:20.49]He needs to be free.
[204:22.05]Oh, my God.
[204:23.91]I'm sorry to stop him.
[204:33.67]Pac-Man just absolutely just drops down an elevator shaft.
[204:38.41]You weren't going to win, man.
[204:40.81]You're at like 60% still.
[204:45.85]Travis Touchdown now is in a lot of trouble with Gabe Newell.
[204:49.91]Travis Touchdown is stuck on the ropes.
[204:52.21]Somebody get Travis Touchdown out of here.
[204:56.24]I can't, man.
[204:59.26]Fortnite Jimmy's just...
[205:05.63]long drive dad in the corner the right hand side corner travis touched on trying to get rid of him no he cannot do what is necessary to throw him over pacman still with a lot of hp lots of health still germa thing's been in here for a long time dave newell's been in here for a long time and somebody else is about to enter while gabe newell's and nancy drew's coming in hot here
[205:33.72]Earlier this evening, Nancy Drew won the crew battle.
[205:39.16]Drew Crew prevailed, and obviously she's celebrating for it.
[205:44.91]Big suplex here on Fortnite Jimmy by Jerma Thing.
[205:52.15]Drew Crew has taken a few wins today, and that's it for Fortnite Jimmy Jerma Thing.
[205:56.43]Freaked out.
[205:57.86]And then another elimination.
[205:59.26]Gabe Newell just destroys Long Drive Dad.
[206:01.65]People are going to be really upset by that one.
[206:03.05]Gabe Newell on the hunt here.
[206:04.57]Maybe going for a second elimination in a row.
[206:10.39]Nancy Drew with a big boot.
[206:14.27]Getting some taunting by Gabe Newell.
[206:18.17]I'm not sure what he's doing here, but he's... Maybe they're going to work together and try to eliminate Travis Touchdown.
[206:22.95]Well, German Thing's in a lot of trouble.
[206:25.21]And incoming next is from Lord of the Rings.
[206:27.68]You know him as the dwarf.
[206:30.56]Here comes Gimli.
[206:33.92]Nancy Drew, that's a really bad place to be right now.
[206:35.64]You don't want to be taunting up there.
[206:40.50]And my axe.
[206:42.06]And my... What's going on with his hair?
[206:44.18]His hair is a life of its own.
[206:49.39]Big maneuver.
[206:50.97]Big double punch into the elbow drop right on the top of the skull.
[206:57.20]Gabe Newell is just working on to Gimli.
[207:00.90]For some reason, Gabe Newell has it out for the Lord of the Rings.
[207:03.10]Huge elbow drop.
[207:07.14]Wait, what?
[207:09.24]Pac-Man has been eliminated.
[207:11.98]Pac-Man has been eliminated from the Rumble, and Travis' touchdown might be right after.
[207:17.91]Oh, no.
[207:19.93]Oh, no.
[207:20.97]Gabe Newell has just been eliminated by Jerma Thing, and so has Travis' touchdown.
[207:24.39]We're getting down...
[207:27.68]to the few here.
[207:31.22]Nancy Drew.
[207:33.48]You got to get rid of Nancy Drew.
[207:34.58]She's currently running on the high of her victory with the Drew crew.
[207:39.60]I think Gimli and Jerma Thing have to work together and get her out of here.
[207:44.11]Unfortunately, Gabe Newell could not get the redemption that a lot of you think he may have deserved.
[207:49.11]It's okay.
[207:49.43]His wall dad's coming in.
[207:52.83]An older competitor from the last Rumble.
[207:55.91]Wall dad.
[207:58.92]Going right.
[207:59.40]Oh, no.
[207:59.92]What a reversal by Nancy Drew.
[208:03.28]What is Jerma Thing doing?
[208:05.00]He's just pulling his hair?
[208:05.98]He's not going to just... He is wild.
[208:12.46]He is very wild and untamed.
[208:19.15]Is Gimli going to get dropped here?
[208:21.31]No, not quite.
[208:22.53]Not quite.
[208:24.63]Next competitor is, of course, a jar of mayonnaise.
[208:29.43]One of the most delicious snacks.
[208:30.99]One of the most delicious additives you could possibly put on any food product.
[208:34.62]It's good on French fries.
[208:38.14]It's good on turkey sandwiches.
[208:40.00]It's really good in tuna.
[208:41.04]If you make like a tuna sandwich.
[208:42.96]Jar of mayonnaise.
[208:44.30]In a little goes a long way, by the way.
[208:45.68]You don't have to use a whole lot.
[208:49.13]It's really good on some other stuff, too.
[208:50.41]It's good.
[208:50.79]Hold on.
[208:51.01]We got some action here.
[208:53.49]Gimli is about to eliminate Jerma Thing.
[208:55.61]Is Waldad going to let this happen?
[208:56.89]He is.
[208:57.27]There he goes.
[209:00.80]That is the end for Germa Thing, and here comes a Pasta Italiano Chef from Casino Inc.
[209:14.21]Fuck, somebody said, fuck Nancy?
[209:19.50]Pasta Italiano Chef, you don't know, they've had plenty of...
[209:24.14]Plenty of really bad things happened to their restaurant and to them.
[209:27.06]Always the subject of attacks and mob hits.
[209:33.34]But here now to try to use some of their own firepower.
[209:38.75]That was a really, really big move by the Jar of Mayonnaise.
[209:42.55]And BF Bugleberry is now number 19 coming in.
[209:47.37]Please don't all of you leave.
[209:51.53]Oh, yeah.
[209:52.75]Oh, yeah.
[209:53.05]Oh, yeah.
[209:57.15]Going right for wall dad.
[210:01.51]It's going to be instant.
[210:02.13]Yeah, there he goes.
[210:04.71]That was very violent from BF Bugleberry.
[210:07.75]Trying to get rid of the jar of mayonnaise.
[210:09.13]Nancy Drew and BF Bugleberry working together.
[210:11.14]And nope.
[210:14.96]He's very thick.
[210:16.22]He's very full of vitamins and minerals.
[210:18.26]You can't just get rid of mayonnaise that quickly.
[210:20.02]Don't pour it down the drain either.
[210:21.12]You got to scoop it up and throw it in the trash and stuff.
[210:25.04]It can't go down the drain.
[210:27.59]Beanbag Sonic has just entered the Rumble.
[210:32.67]And he's grown up now.
[210:34.21]He's not just a little shit anymore.
[210:35.67]He's a huge, muscly, fully evolved level 10 Monster Rancher monster.
[210:45.34]It's been quite a while since we've seen Beanbag Sonic.
[210:48.18]He's been training.
[210:49.37]And there goes the Pasta Italiano Chef by Gimli.
[210:52.79]Gone almost as fast as he came in.
[210:56.29]And here comes Mr. Green.
[211:02.08]What is the jar of mayonnaise doing?
[211:04.89]Mr. Green coming in.
[211:06.41]Looks like he lost his pants in a game of poker, but he's here.
[211:14.70]BF Bugleberry gets dumped over and Nancy Drew gets eliminated.
[211:18.08]Oh no.
[211:20.02]I had high hopes for Nancy Drew.
[211:21.18]I thought she was going to go a long way, but Mr. Green is on an absolute tirade here.
[211:25.74]He was so strong.
[211:27.22]He just picked up a level 10 Monster Rancher, fully developed monster, and just threw it like it was a fucking piece of cheese.
[211:37.09]Gimli is still sticking around.
[211:38.25]Look at that health, though.
[211:39.06]Not doing well.
[211:44.08]Oh, no.
[211:45.46]What are they doing?
[211:49.77]What the fuck was that?
[211:51.39]What was that?
[211:53.88]And here comes Chuck E. Cheese at number 22.
[211:58.10]Big power bomb on Mr. Green from the Jar of Mayonnaise.
[212:00.46]Chuck E. Cheese, everybody's favorite rat.
[212:04.23]Well, not everybody's favorite rat.
[212:06.69]Not really, I don't think anyone's favorite rat.
[212:10.70]I could probably name a few that go in front.
[212:13.38]Jerry from Ratatouille.
[212:15.56]The giant rat that makes all the rules.
[212:19.76]Tom.
[212:20.56]No, Jerry from Tom and Jerry.
[212:24.74]Who else?
[212:26.82]From Wallace and Gromit.
[212:27.76]There's that one rat short.
[212:31.74]It's a mouse.
[212:32.44]Whatever.
[212:34.24]Welcome Chuck E. Cheese to the Rumble.
[212:35.72]I hope you get instantly eliminated.
[212:37.12]And Murius is at number 23.
[212:38.22]We're getting down to the final eight.
[212:41.14]Final seven coming in here.
[212:44.54]Oh, boy, would you love to see a Murius-Jerba Rumble 2020 win.
[212:48.28]I'll tell you, that's a good New Year's Eve present for me.
[212:50.34]One of my favorite characters.
[212:55.38]Chuck E. Cheese is getting stomped by Gimli.
[212:57.34]Gimli, by the way, still in here.
[212:59.62]There goes Mr. Green by the Jar of Mayonnaise.
[213:03.74]Jar of Mayo looking to be a pretty high seed here.
[213:08.23]And also representing the Wink Dinks, here comes Jerma Wink.
[213:12.71]Saw him lose earlier tonight, but that's okay.
[213:16.27]Still coming in to represent for the Rumble.
[213:18.32]No, goddammit, Gimli.
[213:20.10]Fuck.
[213:21.50]No, why he's so good?
[213:23.64]All right, there's only one opportunity where I'm going to say Chuck E. Cheese is better than Lord of the Rings, and it's right now.
[213:28.76]This is the only time you'll ever hear me say that.
[213:31.48]Get rid of Gimli.
[213:32.63]He's doing too good.
[213:40.48]D'Armao is just taking a little breather here.
[213:42.58]Who's number 25?
[213:45.00]Seaman.
[213:45.56]Here he comes.
[213:49.50]From the Dreamcast.
[213:54.52]Seems to be also a full-grown adult and not just a little baby tadpole anymore.
[214:00.85]Beanbag Sonic with a big suplex.
[214:02.83]Yeah, you got to get rid of Gimli.
[214:09.97]No, get, hey, Dink.
[214:11.85]Hey, you fucking Dink.
[214:13.71]Get rid of Gimli together.
[214:15.29]He's like the top seed right now.
[214:16.87]You want it, Chuck E. Cheese, come on.
[214:19.95]Go for it, go for it, go for it.
[214:23.31]G-Red is, there he goes.
[214:24.71]Thank God for Chuck E. Cheese.
[214:27.91]G-Red from Gotcha Force is the next competitor.
[214:33.22]If he comes in, for some reason he's not coming down.
[214:36.68]Somebody needs to like turn the toy on.
[214:39.76]There he is!
[214:41.60]The strongest of all the Gachubots.
[214:44.08]We have G-Red.
[214:49.43]Okay, already showing that he is very strong.
[214:52.81]Okay, he's, oh my god!
[214:56.39]The gacha force has made it to the Jerma Arena!
[215:02.93]And he's also, weirdly enough, weirdly enough, he is about four inches tall.
[215:09.03]But in the Jerma Rumble universe, he is like eight feet tall.
[215:12.68]And what's that I see at number 27?
[215:15.22]What's that I see at number 27?
[215:16.52]That is Catboy Jerma!
[215:20.02]Catboy Jerma!
[215:22.38]Making their appearance for the first time in the Jerma Arena.
[215:25.99]Just trying to see who to attack, who to scratch, who to bite at.
[215:32.35]Going right for Beanbag Sonic, what an excellent idea.
[215:34.99]Catboy Jerma, no, gets reversed.
[215:39.54]Seaman got your red.
[215:41.92]Catboy Jerma, Beanbag Sonic, a jar of mayonnaise and Chuck E. Cheese are your potential final competitors.
[215:51.26]Potential final competitors.
[215:53.32]Catboy Jerma's got the upper hand on Beanbag Sonic.
[215:56.01]Beanbag Sonic, you gotta do something.
[215:58.57]You gotta reverse it, there's a reversal there.
[216:02.03]Chuck E. Cheese just like choked himself.
[216:05.57]Double punch there onto, they're just punching each other.
[216:09.01]Who comes in at number 29?
[216:10.05]Oh, number 28.
[216:14.33]That would be an Andy Mark robot from the carnival stream.
[216:21.89]Also dressed as the goat to Andy Mark for all your robot needs.
[216:27.29]You got a project going on?
[216:29.58]Andy Mark.
[216:30.42]They're the ones.
[216:33.22]Coming right into the Jar of Mayonnaise.
[216:34.46]They both have the same color scheme.
[216:40.59]This is going to get really interesting because this is it.
[216:44.17]After two... What the hell is going on?
[216:45.81]Jar of Mayonnaise has a bunch of awesome moves.
[216:48.23]Catboy Germa, no, did not fall off of the top ropes.
[216:50.65]And Germa's dump truck.
[216:53.17]One of the final competitors.
[216:54.40]We could see an upset here.
[217:00.58]This could be very upsetting.
[217:03.74]Oh, gotcha red coming in.
[217:06.66]And there goes the jar of mayonnaise.
[217:08.16]Unfortunate.
[217:08.84]Very unfortunate.
[217:09.60]But there he is.
[217:10.26]Why did gotcha red just run over the ropes to eliminate himself?
[217:15.92]No, he's still in.
[217:16.66]What was that?
[217:19.94]Catboy Jerma into the turnbuckle as Chuck E. Cheese now trying to get some work done.
[217:27.62]Jerma's dump truck.
[217:29.02]Gotcha red.
[217:32.59]Holy shit, it's almost midnight.
[217:34.41]Uh, what time is it?
[217:34.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:35.53]It's almost midnight Eastern.
[217:39.41]I don't even have the song queued up.
[217:45.84]The ball's dropping right now.
[217:47.40]Catboy Jerma playing to the crowd.
[217:48.84]The ball's gonna drop like right now.
[217:53.22]Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.
[217:56.34]Did Andy Mark just got eliminated?
[217:58.84]Oh no, the Andy Mark robot.
[218:02.35]with the power of 100 asses.
[218:05.05]No, Got You Red still in the fight.
[218:07.95]And is it New Year yet?
[218:10.56]Not yet, not yet, not yet.
[218:12.48]About 35 seconds.
[218:19.78]One of these is going to be the winner of your 2020 Rumble.
[218:24.97]You understand?
[218:27.85]One of these is your winner.
[218:34.93]Catboy Jerma.
[218:37.83]Trying to get Seaman into the corner.
[218:39.09]No, he throws him right into Gotcha Red.
[218:43.84]Five seconds.
[218:45.56]Three, two, one.
[218:47.74]Happy New Year, everybody.
[218:50.02]Happy New Year.
[218:59.94]And the final contestant of the night is Juggles the Greatest Streamer.
[219:09.29]Juggles the Great is your final competitor.
[219:16.09]Looks like he's got a full belly.
[219:19.29]Sitting in his underwear.
[219:22.59]Who did Catboy Germans eliminate?
[219:25.01]Who just got eliminated?
[219:28.06]Seaman just got eliminated by Catboy Jerma, and goodbye Catboy Jerma.
[219:31.90]Got your red.
[219:33.20]With a major big elimination there.
[219:34.90]Oh, high hopes for Catboy Jerma, but it didn't happen.
[219:42.83]Unfortunately.
[219:44.91]And Juggles the Great comes right in and gets a DDT, and Jerma's dump truck is just like splinting that ass right on the turnbuckle.
[219:50.89]He don't care.
[219:54.25]Nice twisting arm flexing smash glass breaking attack onto Chuck E. Cheese as Gotcha Red juggles the grade.
[220:03.54]It's going to be shaking him up here over the top turnbuckle.
[220:07.98]No, I don't think he can do it.
[220:09.38]He's not strong enough.
[220:12.87]Not strong enough.
[220:18.73]Gotcha Red is still holding on for dear life and he still has pretty decent health.
[220:25.27]His health is pretty good.
[220:29.17]It's going to be really hard to eliminate.
[220:30.45]Got you for us.
[220:31.67]G-Red.
[220:33.57]Greatest GameCube game ever made.
[220:35.31]And it's also the most expensive.
[220:37.31]It's like $300 to buy that game.
[220:39.79]Goodbye Beanbag Sonic.
[220:41.07]That's it.
[220:43.43]That was such an opportunity.
[220:44.43]That's such a disappointment.
[220:46.23]Huge disappointment.
[220:48.10]Beanbag Sonic is out.
[220:53.00]This looks like it's going to come down.
[220:56.39]to G-Red and somebody.
[221:03.22]Juggles the Great going for a big punch.
[221:05.18]Not enough to knock him down, though.
[221:06.36]Chuck E. Cheese just overhead through.
[221:10.14]Wait, what?
[221:11.07]He just did it twice.
[221:11.93]He just pulled him back, yonked him back, and did it again.
[221:17.71]Your final three competitors are Chuck E. Cheese, Gotcha Red, and Juggles the Great.
[221:25.08]This is anybody's fight here.
[221:26.70]Oh, no.
[221:30.85]Gotcha Red with a big comeback.
[221:34.41]He's going to dump him.
[221:38.03]Gee, Red.
[221:40.41]Is he going to just sit there and let him do it or is he going to break it up?
[221:43.07]I don't know.
[221:43.69]No, it's not enough to dump Chuck E. Cheese.
[221:50.46]Here it is.
[221:52.86]Being back, Sonic, in the background.
[221:54.07]Here are your final three.
[221:55.79]Who could be crowned the 2020 champion of the 2020 Derma Rumble?
[222:03.71]Chuck E. Cheese is going to get dumped here, and it's going to be... No?
[222:09.14]Is he going to let him do it?
[222:10.94]Is Chuck E. Cheese going to fight back?
[222:12.28]Come on, Chuck E. Cheese.
[222:13.20]No!
[222:13.98]There goes Chuck E. Cheese.
[222:15.04]A competitor has been eliminated.
[222:21.41]Douglas the Great and G-Red.
[222:23.96]Douglas the Great is the last person to come in.
[222:27.56]Let's see if G-Red gets... Oh, my God!
[222:32.30]I thought he was going to throw him directly over the ropes.
[222:36.38]Did you see?
[222:36.84]You see the momentum.
[222:37.78]You see the excitement in that grab.
[222:46.58]He's going to prove to everybody once and for all
[222:50.15]that this was worth streaming and that it was a great game.
[222:55.98]Is he going to do it?
[222:57.32]Can he dump him?
[222:58.24]Can he dump Juggles?
[223:01.80]Is G-Red going to win the Rumble?
[223:03.82]No, it's not enough.
[223:05.04]Juggles with the reversal.
[223:10.09]Oh no, he's getting slow.
[223:12.25]He's slowing down.
[223:13.11]It's going to take a miracle.
[223:16.17]Big belly-to-belly suplex, but Juggles is red too.
[223:19.85]Uh-oh, he's going for the fucking belly shake.
[223:25.16]Or he's going for the human brick.
[223:28.68]Oh, no.
[223:29.72]He just keeps doing it.
[223:40.90]That's three belly shakes.
[223:43.68]Three belly shakes in a row.
[223:45.02]But wait a minute.
[223:46.52]Wait a minute.
[223:50.53]He reversed it.
[223:52.35]Huge clothesline.
[223:55.93]Gotcha, Red.
[223:57.01]He's got only 2% battery left on his fucking phone.
[224:00.15]Please plug it in for God's sakes.
[224:01.75]You're killing us.
[224:04.21]I'm sick of you sending me screenshots with 4% battery, dude.
[224:07.20]Please.
[224:12.56]Could this be the end?
[224:14.34]Big reversal by Juggles.
[224:18.35]Oh, no.
[224:19.32]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[224:20.98]Can he?
[224:21.56]He's... No.
[224:23.58]He's still holding on for dear life.
[224:27.72]G-Red has no HP left.
[224:29.42]He's just floating there.
[224:32.11]It's going to happen.
[224:33.13]It's over.
[224:34.49]It's over.
[224:36.57]It's over.
[224:38.25]No.
[224:39.27]No.
[224:39.73]You can't let him do this to you, G-Red.
[224:41.49]That's it.
[224:43.13]Juggles.
[224:43.94]Number 30.
[224:46.22]Bastard comes in at the very end.
[224:53.81]Oh, I really thought he was going to pull it off.
[224:58.90]Too bad.
[224:59.70]Too bad.
[225:00.44]Juggles the Great is your 2020 German Rumble winner.
[225:03.06]I mean, you can't come back from three massive Gatorade-fold stomach frog splashes.
[225:15.23]It's not going to happen.
[225:16.69]It's just not going to happen.
[225:17.31]You got to be realistic.
[225:21.87]Juggles the Great.
[225:25.36]Is your winner, unfortunately.
[225:28.74]Unfortunately, I really was rooting for Gotcha Red.
[225:36.45]I want the Catboy Germa timeline.
[225:42.05]You want to do another one?
[225:43.13]Encore?
[225:43.45]For fun?
[225:47.77]Just for fun?
[225:48.77]Watch it?
[225:50.83]Gee, Red got robbed.
[225:51.67]They really did.
[225:54.31]Encore?
[225:57.52]Just one more for fun?
[225:59.04]I just, like, blew my voice out.
[226:04.71]Yeah, let's do it again.
[226:06.01]Why not?
[226:06.25]Let's do it for fun.
[226:09.71]I can't believe the McDLT briefcase guy.
[226:11.77]He got eliminated instantly.
[226:14.66]I want the McDLT briefcase guy to win so bad.
[226:18.24]Double or nothing?
[226:19.06]Uh, no, no.
[226:21.70]That one is the one.
[226:23.22]This one's for fun.
[226:27.44]Send in the green screen.
[226:32.60]Happy New Year, guys.
[226:34.43]Happy New Year.
[226:39.17]Wait, is this the same exact thing?
[226:41.75]Wait, this is not going to do the same exact stuff, right?
[226:47.11]Is this the same exact participants coming in?
[226:55.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[226:56.40]We got to shuffle this.
[227:02.92]Yeah, we gotta shuffle this.
[227:04.18]We can't have the whole thing happen.
[227:05.15]Alright, give me a sec.
[227:11.13]What do you think?
[227:11.53]Should we add... You wanna add a couple of Ritz brothers?
[227:18.47]What do you think?
[227:26.63]Add Majima and Kiryu?
[227:27.73]Okay.
[227:28.85]We'll add... Oh, yeah.
[227:29.47]We'll just... Just watch me do this.
[227:38.34]All right, so it doesn't really matter who comes in first.
[227:40.18]What do you think?
[227:40.58]We'll add, I mean, Beanbag Sonic, you can do random.
[227:44.72]That's good.
[227:45.10]All right, participants.
[227:48.02]Let's add everybody.
[227:49.19]Should we add Big Banana?
[227:57.15]You see, like this, that's... Big Banana go in?
[228:02.89]All right.
[228:06.97]By the way, this is not the order.
[228:08.13]I'm just putting people in.
[228:13.23]Fortnite.
[228:15.94]Oh, Andy Mark's already in it?
[228:16.82]Okay, let's go like this.
[228:19.44]Put the green screen in?
[228:20.44]The green screen is not in this game.
[228:22.22]I've got 2020.
[228:23.62]This is not 2018 anymore.
[228:25.04]Which is kind of funny because 2018 is probably a better game.
[228:37.36]What about Glue Man?
[228:37.84]Yeah, I'll put him in.
[228:42.49]Just make him.
[228:44.81]Make him now.
[228:46.67]Leave Roman Reigns in.
[228:48.79]No, why?
[228:51.52]Just make a big green guy that has 100 and all stats.
[228:59.94]Jax is already in.
[229:05.65]Let's put one of the Ritz brothers in it.
[229:06.93]Let's put Al Ritz in it.
[229:08.01]Why not?
[229:11.57]Please, Jeremy.
[229:12.11]Please do it.
[229:12.73]Do it now.
[229:14.37]Where was he?
[229:16.48]Why was he not in the rumble?
[229:18.88]What?
[229:23.12]I was wondering.
[229:23.82]There were two or three people that were missing.
[229:26.04]Who else was missing from the rumble?
[229:35.64]Oh, no longer counts, we didn't have all the competitors!
[229:43.94]Oh shit, alright, that's, no, that's accurate.
[229:52.30]I, yeah, I was wondering, I was like, what, wait, what happened, what happened to Joel?
[229:54.78]I made Joel, and I put him in.
[229:56.00]Yeah, it's time for a rematch.
[230:03.75]I hope Joel fucking wins now.
[230:08.02]Oh, you know what it was?
[230:08.72]It's probably because Wink Dink was not supposed to be in the Rumble.
[230:16.62]That was supposed to be Joel.
[230:17.69]Because they already had their match.
[230:19.11]So, yeah, that's what happened.
[230:21.55]All right.
[230:22.37]Obviously, Long Drive dead.
[230:28.51]What about Catboy?
[230:29.41]I know.
[230:29.87]I'm getting to it.
[230:30.52]I'm getting to it.
[230:41.52]No, Roman Reigns is not staying in.
[230:49.43]Maxon?
[230:51.51]Gotta put the pencil in.
[230:59.13]Get Gimli out.
[231:02.45]Gimli out?
[231:02.99]Should I throw out Gimli?
[231:04.36]Put him in Jima?
[231:07.32]Yeah, get rid of J- Yeah, German Wink was not supposed to be there.
[231:16.91]Okay, does this look good?
[231:19.25]Remove the jar of mayo.
[231:20.53]He eliminated, like, five people.
[231:22.37]He was really good.
[231:22.93]I think that looks good.
[231:32.68]Now, just, you know, just remove me for Gimli.
[231:34.80]Seriously.
[231:41.17]DLT briefcase guy's 100.
[231:42.13]And what about it?
[231:49.11]But you don't think that he's like one of the strongest people here?
[231:50.73]What are you talking about?
[231:55.41]Is that seriously a question that you're asking?
[231:58.42]Put Jerma back in.
[232:01.10]Remove the Ritz, brother.
[232:02.16]All right, fine.
[232:07.52]Take juggles out.
[232:08.20]He already won.
[232:09.12]That's a good idea.
[232:09.96]That's a good point.
[232:10.44]All right, Travis, touchdown Pac-Man or Sam or Max.
[232:15.70]We'll cure you.
[232:21.96]Travis touchdown.
[232:25.40]Get the pencil out.
[232:26.30]All right.
[232:26.62]Get the pencil out of here.
[232:27.70]Fuck this guy.
[232:29.38]We'll carry you in.
[232:31.88]And.
[232:32.08]Big banana.
[232:38.96]I think this is good.
[232:44.94]This is fine.
[232:45.30]This is all right.
[232:46.56]This is good.
[232:49.65]No, I want to watch that fucker get snapped in two.
[232:51.65]Well, this is good.
[232:55.48]What about Pac-Man?
[232:58.18]We can get rid of Jigsaw.
[232:59.26]He was shitty.
[233:03.48]He came in and got eliminated instantly.
[233:04.89]We'll put Max in instead of Jigsaw.
[233:10.99]I mean, it's hard to... There are too many characters here.
[233:14.64]What about Murius?
[233:16.58]Oh, shit.
[233:17.02]That is like my favorite character.
[233:18.14]All right.
[233:18.46]I'm going to trade.
[233:19.06]I can't trade Dr. Schmoyson.
[233:24.34]I'm not getting rid of Catboy, Jeremiah.
[233:25.48]What are you, nuts?
[233:30.78]I don't know.
[233:31.08]I can't remove anybody.
[233:35.54]Get rid of the pasta Italiano chef.
[233:38.68]Get rid of mayo.
[233:39.90]I like the mayo.
[233:40.86]It's like my favorite food.
[233:44.09]I think this is good.
[233:46.36]I think this is alright.
[233:47.52]I'm okay with this.
[233:52.46]Get rid of Fortnite Jimmy.
[233:53.64]No.
[233:55.64]Get Gimli out of here.
[233:56.84]Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[234:01.09]I'm going to get rid of Kiryu.
[234:02.97]We're going to have only one person represent the franchise, right?
[234:06.49]We'll put Murius in.
[234:07.29]We're going to get rid of Sam is not here, right?
[234:14.49]And then we're going to get... Yeah, fuck Gimli.
[234:16.03]Get him out of here.
[234:18.39]Pac-Man?
[234:20.41]Yeah, Pac-Man.
[234:22.07]That looks good to me.
[234:26.81]That looks good to me.
[234:29.82]Let's go.
[234:30.16]Let's turn entrances off.
[234:38.82]We don't need it.
[234:39.22]Uh-huh.
[234:41.20]Okay.
[234:42.60]Here we go.
[234:46.92]Let's move.
[234:48.52]Jigsaw?
[234:49.69]No.
[234:50.71]He's dead.
[234:52.47]He got knocked over the top rope and landed on his head.
[234:54.71]He's not coming back.
[235:01.66]Alright, let's go.
[235:04.56]Here comes the redo.
[235:07.34]Well, not really redo.
[235:08.26]More of an encore.
[235:09.26]An encore.
[235:15.39]Jigsaw is going to have fun in, looks like Mr. Green and Jerma Thing are the first two contestants in the ring.
[235:24.33]And in all these WWE games, if you're not in the last like 10 to 15 people, you're not going to win.
[235:32.01]So enjoy the time they have in here now because they're going to be gone in about two to three minutes.
[235:39.36]But that's Mr. Green and that's Jerma Thing.
[235:45.23]No green screen.
[235:46.35]Well, look it.
[235:46.79]He's green.
[235:48.39]Just imagine he was the green screen.
[235:51.13]He's usually one of the last four.
[235:54.15]Yeah, usually.
[235:56.47]Andy Mark robot.
[235:57.59]Andy Mark goat.
[236:00.55]Again, these are the guys that did the carnival stuff.
[236:03.90]They made all the carnival robots, which were incredible.
[236:06.36]Everybody loves Andy Mark.
[236:10.88]Trying to get rid of Mr. Green.
[236:13.18]And they do.
[236:18.73]Nobody fucks with Mr. Green.
[236:20.77]Unless it's multiple people fucking with Mr. Green.
[236:24.02]And he gets thrown.
[236:24.88]God damn it.
[236:25.64]I want him in like the final 10.
[236:29.60]How do I give him like extra points?
[236:32.93]McDLT briefcase guy.
[236:35.75]Is in.
[236:39.07]At number four.
[236:43.22]I mean, they all have good stats.
[236:44.56]The only one that didn't have good stats was Fortnite Jimmy has like under 70.
[236:48.52]I think he's the only person.
[236:50.12]100 stats.
[236:57.94]No, he doesn't have 100 stats.
[237:01.66]Dave Newell at number 5.
[237:06.20]You should play Long Drive again.
[237:12.46]Who had the most eliminations?
[237:13.48]Like, cheers to you.
[237:15.90]Cheers to you eliminated at least three or four people, at least.
[237:18.12]Nice DDT onto the ropes.
[237:27.64]By the McDLT briefcase guy.
[237:33.02]Long drive two.
[237:34.02]Well, I mean, I kind of have to.
[237:35.04]We won best stream of the year.
[237:36.64]But that's kind of scary.
[237:38.88]Because what if you guys thought it was so good?
[237:40.75]What if the sequel's not good enough?
[237:42.98]What if I play that game again and stream it and it's just... I'm just not... It's not as funny.
[237:49.46]It's going to get multiplayer soon.
[237:50.66]Oh, shit.
[237:51.06]Nice.
[237:53.02]What the hell was that?
[237:53.70]Yeah, I feel like lightning struck.
[237:58.54]I don't know if lightning can strike twice.
[238:05.93]Gabe Newell going for an elimination here on Andy Mark.
[238:10.61]Kermit Thing getting involved...
[238:13.47]And there's the dump.
[238:14.45]See you later.
[238:15.13]Andy Mark and Pac-Man by the McDLT briefcase guy.
[238:19.03]G-Red coming in.
[238:24.75]G-Red making the appearance for the second time.
[238:27.26]Almost won the quote-unquote official one.
[238:33.64]But we can have more than one.
[238:34.78]There can be two official winners, right?
[238:38.46]Big powerbomb.
[238:39.46]That was huge.
[238:41.41]Pac-Man got ghosted.
[238:48.19]Yeah, he was gone instantly, huh?
[238:52.95]BF Bugleberry at number eight.
[238:54.33]You know, I'd really love to see Gabe Newell win.
[239:02.62]I really would.
[239:05.26]He was in all the original ones.
[239:09.98]He always got so close.
[239:11.20]I'd love to see a Gabe Newell victory here.
[239:17.65]Or a Catboy one.
[239:21.76]I would love to see a Jerma Catboy Rumble victory.
[239:34.02]Catboy.
[239:35.95]Big suplex from Gabe Newell onto Jerma Thing.
[239:39.55]As Chuck E. Cheese coming up at almost number 10.
[239:48.43]Hey, there was also a pretty equal chance that Chuck E. Cheese was going to win too.
[239:51.65]So you tell me what's worse.
[239:53.56]And there he goes.
[239:56.38]There, he's gone.
[239:57.64]My favorite character.
[239:58.34]He's got a fucking hundred in every stat.
[240:00.08]That's how you know that it doesn't matter.
[240:03.16]He has almost 100 in every stat.
[240:05.33]Are they going to dump Gabe Newell?
[240:10.31]What's the worst outcome?
[240:12.11]Chuck E. Cheese or... Is Chuck E. Cheese almost one?
[240:17.67]There goes Max.
[240:21.92]Catboy is the worst outcome.
[240:23.96]Every time this ticks up and it's not Catboy is a higher chance at a Catboy Rumble victory.
[240:31.43]Or even a BF Bugleberry victory because look, he's still there.
[240:42.17]Chuck E. Cheese on the ropes.
[240:43.75]Max.
[240:46.87]I love Max.
[240:47.63]Max looks so funny.
[240:49.97]German Thing looks really funny too.
[240:53.83]Jerma985 in his full body cast.
[240:56.25]Come on out.
[240:56.71]Let's see what you can do.
[241:01.41]Am I going to win?
[241:01.98]Can I win?
[241:09.98]What was that?
[241:11.70]Dermathing.
[241:12.34]How much health does Dermathing have?
[241:14.76]He's okay.
[241:16.14]He's going to powerbomb over the top rope.
[241:18.64]Max is fucked.
[241:22.45]See you later.
[241:26.97]Is he going to go for Chuck E. Cheese too?
[241:28.15]Oh, I don't know.
[241:30.26]Dr. Schmoyk's going to come in at number 12.
[241:40.85]good doctor grandma thing it has pretty low HP but he's still there just hammering on the back of Chuck E cheese right in his spine help him dump him get rid of him
[242:06.61]Get Chuck E. Cheese out of here.

[242:09.31]No.
[242:09.65]Get like.
[242:10.41]Yes, please.
[242:11.15]No.
[242:11.47]Okay.
[242:11.93]It didn't work.
[242:14.11]Yes, it is.
[242:14.87]They're both trying as hard as they can.
[242:16.53]Did he spit on him?
[242:21.81]Did he just get spit on?
[242:32.09]Big scoop up by G-Red.
[242:36.36]Oh, fuck.
[242:37.24]I'm getting a little zonked.
[242:39.82]Why are they lying on top of each other?
[242:41.50]Wait, what happened?
[242:44.50]Why are they all lined up together?
[242:47.40]They're lying down like sardines.
[242:57.54]Long drive, dad, coming in.
[243:00.14]Takes a headbutt from the biggest mouse I've ever seen.
[243:07.44]Everybody's favorite character is about to go.
[243:09.08]Buy Chuck E. Cheese, of course, instantly.
[243:10.87]Or Gabe Newell, which everybody likes Gabe Newell.
[243:14.67]Chuck E. Cheese, you maniac.
[243:19.21]Absolute maniac.
[243:24.13]EF Bugleberry with a sliding tackle.
[243:28.32]Drew Crew is better than Catboy Crew.
[243:32.72]That's a debate that you guys can have here.
[243:42.38]Bugleberry going on the top rope.
[243:44.72]What is he going for?
[243:46.38]Oh, my God.
[243:47.13]And I was right in my chest.
[243:48.81]Really?
[243:49.13]Really, Bugleberry?
[243:52.71]You're going to kick a man when he's down?
[243:55.87]Really?
[243:58.45]Get him out.
[243:59.17]Throw him out of here.
[244:05.44]He felt my anger.
[244:06.66]He could feel it.
[244:10.92]German 985.
[244:13.38]Letting the adrenaline take over.
[244:16.14]Little does everybody know that after this adrenaline wears off, he's going to be off for about three and a half months.
[244:24.36]But at least he might be able to pull the victory.
[244:25.72]Is Dr. Smoysen going down?
[244:30.86]What just happened to Gabe Newell?
[244:31.77]Is that a punch or is that a...
[244:38.96]Punching him in the face over and over again.
[244:41.82]Can I get rid of Chuck E. Cheese too?
[244:43.93]I'm fucking angry right now, guys.
[244:47.93]Look at my face.
[244:49.69]I mean absolute business right now.
[244:53.53]Holy shit.
[244:57.58]No, no.
[244:58.16]Gee, Red's putting a stop to that right now.
[245:02.04]Oh, he's going to dump me.
[245:04.44]He's going to dump me.
[245:05.44]Gabe Newell, please get up and help me.
[245:10.24]Alright, okay.
[245:12.72]Come on, Gabe.
[245:13.64]Get up and help.
[245:16.14]No, no.
[245:16.60]I mean, like, help me.
[245:17.94]I'm gone.
[245:19.28]See you later.
[245:22.20]Still fought it off, somehow.
[245:25.95]Are you kidding me?
[245:28.87]Why was I just standing there?
[245:30.13]Oh, shit!
[245:34.57]Gabe Newell has been eliminated by a huge lariat by Long Drive Dad.
[245:38.56]And here comes Joel...
[245:40.44]Varg Skeletor.
[245:44.23]Big elimination on G-Red.
[245:52.01]First time we've seen a crossover here on this channel.
[245:55.37]Representing Vine Wrestle.
[245:57.45]Joel.
[245:59.41]Vine Sauce Joel.
[246:04.99]I don't know what happened.
[246:06.19]That was like too many points.
[246:07.59]Are they double teaming?
[246:13.48]Germathing is still in this.
[246:15.62]Germa985 is also still in this.
[246:18.22]And so is Dr. Schmoikson, who's been here for a while as well.
[246:22.64]Big slap by Germathing onto Joel.
[246:27.66]He's looking for a place to dump me.
[246:29.12]That's what this is.
[246:34.86]Oh, no.
[246:36.04]No, no.
[246:37.00]Don't let the doctor eliminate you.
[246:42.72]no one's throwing me out man I'm staying in this for a long time big stunner can't capitalize but they cannot follow up with it and then pasta italiano coming in chef from that delicious fine establishment just flipped up like a pancake
[247:14.72]Juggles coming in.
[247:15.76]If Juggles is 30 again, I'm going to be pissed.
[247:18.24]I'm going to be so mad.
[247:22.15]Murius the Cow from the Drew crew.
[247:23.63]I mean, the Moo crew.
[247:24.81]Oh, what happened?
[247:27.39]Did Joel get just a... What?
[247:30.53]Why was that like times two speed?
[247:31.94]That was weird.
[247:33.46]Joel just got eliminated by Dr. Smoytson.
[247:38.92]You're a thing.
[247:40.88]With another attempt on long drive, Dad.
[247:44.81]Well, thank you, Joel, for joining us at the Jerva Rumble 2020.
[247:59.04]Beanbag Sonic coming in next.
[248:00.36]I thought Joel was going to be in it for a while.
[248:08.55]I'm surprised.
[248:11.75]Can't, like, stick him with those horns.
[248:14.93]Dr. Schmoyk said completely misses.
[248:17.51]Completely.
[248:17.97]I don't even know what he was punching.
[248:20.89]And now he's in trouble.
[248:21.76]Being back in a good spot by the way.
[248:23.38]Coming in.
[248:23.68]Okay.
[248:25.16]Okay.
[248:27.86]Goodbye.
[248:29.00]Goodbye.
[248:30.32]He just ran.
[248:32.42]Pastor Taliano is gone.
[248:38.65]He threw him so hard that he's continuing to run by himself on his own.
[248:44.18]jesus beanbag sonic absolutely crushing it right now eliminates two people in a row there goes german on eight five eliminated four fan favorites are in the ring right now just want to make that clear
[249:11.67]There goes Long Drive Dad and in comes Glue Man at number 18.
[249:18.85]Is this the opportunity for Glue Man to at least get a win here?
[249:21.88]Is this the opportunity?
[249:26.32]So far, not so good.
[249:35.57]This is the spot you want to be in.
[249:36.69]It's going to be one of these people here.
[249:40.62]You know what?
[249:41.16]Alright, here you go.
[249:42.30]Beanbag Sonic's going to win this, I think.
[249:47.11]Really good position.
[249:48.31]Just beat up the horse.
[249:49.99]The cow.
[249:52.35]Travis Touchdown is number 19.
[249:54.19]Still no sign of Dermacatboy.
[249:58.40]Which I think is concerning a lot of you.
[250:08.29]By the way, anybody see Travis Touchdown's shirt?
[250:11.37]Get a good look right now.
[250:13.57]Anybody know what that is?
[250:24.65]That is Catboy Jerma on that shirt.
[250:27.35]Yes, you are right.
[250:30.16]Here comes Majima at number 20.
[250:31.46]Good place to be in.
[250:35.44]Jerma thing is gone.
[250:40.51]Big right hands by Murius onto Beanbag Sonic.
[250:42.97]Looks like Majiba's gonna finish the job with some shin kicks.
[250:46.52]No, he's gonna get from behind Glue Man.
[250:49.08]He's gonna keep just punching him over and over and over again in the corner.
[250:56.83]He jumped over him and went way too high and flew over the ring I
[251:25.56]There goes Travis touchdown.
[251:26.90]Majima with elimination.
[251:30.62]Big, big banana, bro.
[251:33.92]He's in here in a good place.
[251:36.84]Blue man, though.
[251:40.64]Blue man's ear.
[251:41.62]Blue man's ear.
[251:42.34]It could be.
[251:44.00]Jax is coming in at 22.
[251:45.50]Nice backflip by Majima.
[251:47.02]Holy shit.
[251:47.36]Did you see that?
[251:48.20]That was unbelievable.
[251:50.67]We got Jax, though.
[251:56.11]Why is Jex already at like half health?
[252:00.53]Did he fall down on the way in here?
[252:09.24]Big banana bro looks like he's going to be throwing up Majima.
[252:13.28]No, they both want to get rid of Majima.
[252:16.85]Very strong character, very strong competitor.
[252:19.83]Not going to happen this time.
[252:22.20]Jar of Mayonnaise is coming in at 23.
[252:24.10]Oh, boy.
[252:26.06]Y'all want this to be the cannon one.
[252:29.75]You sure?
[252:30.19]Jar of Mayonnaise coming in.
[252:44.08]Drew Crew, that's possible.
[252:45.44]Juggles is also possible.
[252:46.70]No, he's not.
[252:47.04]He's gone.
[252:51.11]Get mayo out of here.
[252:53.07]The more that I look at that container, the more that I want to eat something with mayonnaise on it right now.
[252:58.87]Fortnite Jivvy number 24.
[252:59.71]The more I look at that jar, I just want mayonnaise on it.
[253:09.36]I want a turkey sandwich with mayo all over it.
[253:14.96]It's a backflip shin hit.
[253:18.27]Verb.
[253:18.61]Noun.
[253:19.13]Noun.
[253:20.65]I'm just saying, I'm thinking the body part that it happened and where they hit.
[253:25.09]Chin head hit.
[253:33.70]There goes Majima by Fortnite Jimmy.
[253:36.64]Catboy Jerma at number 25.
[253:38.95]It's possible.
[253:40.87]It's possible for a Catboy Cannon win.
[253:51.07]Too early?
[253:51.67]I don't know.
[253:53.09]Whoever comes in over the next five, it's very possible.
[254:01.62]Catboy eliminating Murius.
[254:03.84]Oh, no.
[254:04.50]There he goes.
[254:05.24]Murius, my favorite character.
[254:07.80]Besides McDLT briefcase guy.
[254:11.96]Still going after Fortnite Jimmy.
[254:17.05]Nice reversals from Banana Bro.
[254:21.10]What is that?
[254:21.38]Is that a fanny pack on his back?
[254:26.43]There goes Jax, eliminated by Glue Man.
[254:30.59]Glue Man's year could be this year.
[254:32.63]He could win at least one, even if it's the encore.
[254:40.41]Stop the Catboy.
[254:41.61]Anything but Catboy.
[254:42.69]Stop the Catboy.
[254:45.59]I don't know.
[254:46.07]We'll see.
[254:46.97]We'll see.
[254:47.69]Uh-oh.
[254:48.03]Fortnite Jimmy's in trouble.
[254:50.70]He's going to get tossed over by Jerva Catboy.
[254:54.62]Look at the health on Catboy Jerva, by the way.
[254:56.30]Uh-oh.
[255:02.79]Jaramene still can't get eliminated even with two people trying to push him down.
[255:10.37]Holy shit, that was brutal.
[255:18.06]What is going on here?
[255:21.50]Pancake.
[255:25.46]Glue man is on the ground in bad, bad state right now.
[255:29.30]Wall dad coming in at 26.
[255:35.27]No, protect Fortnite Jimmy.
[255:40.09]Alright, dad going after Fortnite Jimmy.
[255:42.11]Let's see.
[255:42.73]Is glue man going to stay in?
[255:46.93]Yeah, he is.
[255:47.55]Glue man still here.
[255:49.51]It's possible it could be the year.
[255:57.59]No, keep him in.
[256:01.85]He's going to turn.
[256:02.81]Oh, he's okay.
[256:05.11]Cheers to you, CD, coming in at 27.
[256:09.29]Yeah, Gloom Man's going to turn into the Undertaker.
[256:11.29]He's going to get to be like 74 years old and still be wrestling.
[256:20.80]But the difference is the Undertaker won WrestleMania like 30 times.
[256:25.24]Gloom Man has done nothing.
[256:30.89]Catboy Claywall Dad eliminated by... Fortnite Jimmy?
[256:35.92]Really?
[256:36.24]Wow, okay.
[256:37.04]That's unexpected.
[256:39.54]Oh, Fortnite Jimmy is pissed.
[256:41.08]He's full of G Fuel.
[256:43.64]He's full of fucking monster energy drinks and Snickers bars.
[256:48.01]Oh, shit.
[256:48.93]No.
[256:57.41]Nancy Drew coming into 28.
[257:05.78]We've got two different crew.
[257:06.94]This is crew matchup rematch again.
[257:17.47]I really wanted Mayo to win.
[257:18.59]If I had to pick somebody in this ring, it would be Mayo or Glue Man.
[257:22.59]Or Nancy Drew.
[257:27.31]I've seen a lot of banana bros.
[257:28.59]People looking for the banana bro to win.
[257:30.55]It's possible.
[257:31.15]He's got pretty good health.
[257:32.93]No, he doesn't.
[257:36.36]Germa's dump truck ass is coming in here.
[257:39.45]At number 29.
[257:40.89]So who's 30?
[257:41.29]Who have we not seen yet?
[257:50.21]Seaman.
[257:51.05]Oh, shit.
[257:53.26]It is Seaman.
[257:55.38]Oh, Gimli.
[258:02.00]This ring is full of just memes right now.
[258:10.12]If I had to put a bet down, I would put it right now on... Wait, I'll wait for the last one.
[258:21.97]I don't think it's going to be Glue Man.
[258:23.07]He's been in here for too long.
[258:23.97]Look at his health.
[258:25.91]It's going to be Dump Truck.
[258:27.51]Just watch.
[258:27.93]Or Nancy Drew.
[258:32.19]Wait, is Catboy regening health?
[258:36.93]Yeah?
[258:38.71]Banana Bro gone.
[258:44.06]Final competitor is Seaman at number 30.
[258:47.02]Here is one of your winners in the ring right now.
[258:50.14]Cheers to UCD.
[258:51.20]Glue Man.
[258:52.54]Jerma Dump Truck.
[258:53.72]Nancy Drew.
[258:54.43]Forget about Glue Man.
[258:55.67]It's not your year.
[258:56.41]It never is.
[258:59.81]One of these will be crowned.
[259:01.17]Catboy Jerma has been eliminated by Fortnite Jimmy.
[259:06.10]Fortnite Jimmy has gone nuts.
[259:16.03]I actually, I think I might change my vote here.
[259:18.43]I think I'm putting it on Fortnite, Jimmy.
[259:23.53]If Beanbag Sonic didn't eliminate himself, I... Dude, come on.
[259:34.56]All right.
[259:35.88]I think it could, I think it's going to be Nancy Drew.
[259:37.64]Dump Truck Seaman, cheers to you, Murius.
[259:47.31]One of these will be the other winner.
[259:51.27]Seaman wins.
[259:52.71]That's stupid.
[259:53.96]He just comes in at 30.
[259:55.06]Nancy Drew cannot let that happen.
[260:01.76]Oh, no.
[260:02.60]Okay.
[260:06.85]Get rid of Seaman.
[260:09.25]Get rid of Seaman.
[260:10.23]There you go.
[260:10.91]Work together.
[260:14.79]Work together.
[260:17.37]What are we doing?
[260:21.03]He's got the most health.
[260:22.01]Well, Dump Truck actually has a lot of health.
[260:25.45]Holy shit.
[260:26.97]He just completely, he completely took him off guard.
[260:29.87]He wasn't even ready.
[260:30.73]He wasn't even ready.
[260:32.27]Oh my God.
[260:38.39]Oh no.
[260:42.47]Nancy Drew and Dump Truck are the last two.
[260:47.35]Who will win the encore?
[260:52.62]I got my money on Nancy Drew.
[260:54.14]It's going to be Nancy Drew.
[260:55.66]This is it.
[260:56.82]This is going to be the end.
[260:57.58]She's going to dump him.
[260:58.58]She's going to dump him over.
[260:59.42]It's over.
[261:00.72]That's it.
[261:01.82]Nancy Drew is your winner of the 2020 Encore Rumble.
[261:09.94]Nancy Drew is your winner.
[261:22.64]Dumped the truck.
[261:23.66]Now it's Nancy versus Juggles for the real winner.
[261:26.07]That sounds like a good idea to me.
[261:34.93]What are the rules?
[261:38.18]Congratulations.
[261:39.58]Congratulations, Nancy Drew.
[261:40.70]Put him in a cage.
[261:45.04]And this is a bet.
[261:45.68]This is going to be a big bet, guys.
[261:50.95]Here comes a big prediction.
[261:53.25]Put him in a cage match.
[261:54.17]Hell in a Cell.
[261:54.97]Okay.
[262:01.70]Put him in a Hell in a Cell.
[262:14.84]Nancy Drew coming in.
[262:20.45]versus uh juggles nancy drew seems to have the advantage select arena sure why not the rundown high school gym here comes the so I mean you can this is probably going to last a little while
[262:48.22]Hell in a Cell, this determines the real victor, the real champion of German Rumble 2020.
[262:59.45]Are predictions live right now?
[263:00.81]They are.
[263:02.29]This is a big one.
[263:07.51]Go to match options.
[263:11.83]No, we're not doing big head mode.
[263:17.52]You went all in?
[263:18.28]Alright.
[263:22.79]Do big head mode.
[263:23.67]Do it.
[263:27.79]We can't do big head mode.
[263:28.97]Not right now.
[263:34.44]No big head mode.
[263:35.32]No.
[263:35.52]This is the championship.
[263:36.60]36 million on who?
[263:46.82]This is a major, major difference here.
[263:49.95]68% of you guys are putting all your money on Nancy Drew.
[263:56.29]Okay.
[263:59.73]See if you guys are right.
[264:06.50]I'm going to get started now.
[264:10.92]Let me bet.
[264:11.74]You got to bet right now.
[264:12.52]You got to use channel points, man.
[264:22.20]closed let's go here comes the champion of the 2020 rumble nancy drew or juggles the great main event hell in a cell in a random rundown high school nice start by nancy drew didn't even wait a second
[264:50.99]Kind of hard to see through this cage, though.
[264:57.43]Underdog?
[264:59.79]Uh-oh.
[265:02.90]How do you win a Hell in a Cell?
[265:04.02]You have to pin, right?
[265:10.18]I would laugh so hard if that was it.
[265:11.74]I would fucking shit my pants if that was seriously how it ended.
[265:16.20]Oh man, Nancy Drew even has better stats.
[265:18.98]It doesn't matter sometimes.
[265:20.00]Momentum is all that matters.
[265:26.00]There we go.
[265:27.07]Nice reversal.
[265:29.51]Switching it up a little bit here.
[265:34.01]What?
[265:40.09]The silence is deafening.
[265:41.43]Yeah.
[265:43.92]Just like, you know, these two people are kind of just throwing around.
[265:46.04]They're kind of just moving their bodies around and, like, landing on their backs.
[265:57.57]Health is not that big of a deal, though.
[265:59.53]This is depressing.
[266:01.13]Quite the main event.
[266:03.43]Yeah, let's go.
[266:04.51]Get him.
[266:14.79]Why is there even a referee in here?
[266:18.07]Why is there a referee in here?
[266:23.45]That would not even hurt.
[266:28.49]You just landed on your back while holding his legs.
[266:30.61]Going for the pin.
[266:37.44]Is it possible?
[266:40.14]Will they use the cage?
[266:41.98]Somebody get up on top of the cage.
[266:52.55]Oof.
[266:53.97]Get on top of the cage.
[266:54.67]Somebody climb the cage.
[267:04.64]It really is so depressing without like fans and like sounds besides on the Undertale OST.
[267:17.89]I think this is it for Nancy Drew, by the way.
[267:20.87]This is it.
[267:23.28]Yeah, that's it.
[267:25.22]Slap in the belly.
[267:25.96]He knows he sees victory.
[267:33.74]Juggles has the momentum, though.
[267:36.12]That could be it.
[267:37.92]One.
[267:39.20]No, one count.
[267:42.50]She just did the Undertaker recovery.
[267:45.40]Come on, Nancy.
[267:48.28]Into the cell.
[267:50.99]Not- I guess not strong enough to knock him- Oh.
[267:57.71]Ooh.
[267:59.11]Ooh.
[268:00.77]Not good.
[268:02.07]Not good for Nancy Drew.
[268:19.77]Oh, this is so dumb.
[268:25.02]Nancy, fight back.
[268:28.14]Fight back, Nancy.
[268:30.72]Fight back.
[268:33.30]No, that's it.
[268:40.73]Juggles the Great ends up winning and ends up taking the crown.
[268:45.37]Or actual Jerma Rumble 2020 winner.
[268:54.72]That what an upset 70% of you guys got it wrong That's it that was like the weird dog crawl He is a superstar Juggles the great congratulations, oh Man
[269:21.85]Do a best out of three?
[269:22.90]No, no.
[269:23.58]No best out of three.
[269:30.44]Worst character?
[269:31.59]What?
[269:32.03]Juggles is a great character.
[269:33.19]How about Super Juggles versus Super Nancy Drew?
[269:39.05]What?
[269:49.75]I want to talk about this for just a second so you probably noticed that the awards this year there was a lot more categories to put nominations in but you didn't see a bunch of those categories it was like another eight or nine categories that uh were not added to this particular stream
[270:10.22]And the reason why is it was going to be like too much to do.
[270:15.06]I didn't want to put a bunch of that on the editor and editors to make like 30 plus videos.
[270:20.53]So what we're going to do is stalling.
[270:23.55]What?
[270:25.47]I'm describing what we're going to do.
[270:28.10]We're going to do an encore awards night that are the sort of extra categories.
[270:37.17]That's probably not going to happen for a little while because I want people to be able to vote on it.
[270:41.95]So I would assume probably in the next like week or two we'll do a sort of like little encore for like an hour or so and we'll just do the other ones.
[270:51.57]Not like as flashy or anything.
[270:54.03]We might not even need videos for it.
[270:56.01]It'll be just fun to kind of look at it though.
[270:58.57]We'll see.
[271:03.19]Give us back our points.
[271:12.23]Give us back the points.
[271:16.12]I kind of like the idea.
[271:16.96]Hold on.
[271:17.22]Let's do... Let me see.
[271:24.52]I kind of want to... I want to see some... You can do like a custom match.
[271:29.54]Oh, wait.
[271:29.98]No, you can't.
[271:36.71]Didn't they add something?
[271:37.75]No.
[271:40.71]I want to do a table match.
[271:45.49]Who's, like, the strongest in here?
[271:47.31]I want to do a... No, not Fortnite Jimmy.
[271:48.97]No, that... No, no, no.
[271:49.71]We're getting away from Fortnite Jimmy.
[271:53.31]Wait, you want Catboy Jerma versus me?
[271:55.23]Okay, we'll do that.
[271:59.52]Catboy Jerma versus Jerma985.
[272:01.40]Oh, no, no, no.
[272:04.30]Against McDLT.
[272:05.06]That's a good idea.
[272:09.72]100 fucking stats.
[272:12.01]Okay, so...
[272:17.54]No, against me.
[272:18.80]But McDLT is my favorite character.
[272:20.74]Fine.
[272:22.70]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[272:28.93]Look, I'm so terrible.
[272:30.07]I'm still going to win.
[272:43.30]CatboyGerman in all capitals, by the way.
[272:51.81]Bets?
[272:53.53]You want to do bets?
[272:55.19]Let's go.
[272:55.89]Go for it.
[272:59.61]Let's do another prediction.
[273:00.41]CatboyGerma versus Jerma985.
[273:01.87]I mean, you saw the stats.
[273:07.60]This is going to be an absolute shitshow.
[273:12.28]I lost everything.
[273:13.28]Oh, no.
[273:15.66]You lost everything?
[273:28.09]With Nancy Drew.
[273:28.91]We said that with Nancy Drew.
[273:29.89]That's right.
[273:30.49]I could just come back here.
[273:31.67]By the way, it's if you get broken through a table.
[273:34.15]You just have to go through the table.
[273:36.48]There's no pinning.
[273:37.06]It's whoever goes through it first.
[273:44.42]2021.
[273:44.72]Yeah.
[273:49.97]We were right in the middle of the rumble, but Happy New Year, guys.
[273:53.47]I know that this year has sucked for many reasons.
[273:59.98]Let's really hope that 2021 is better.
[274:03.22]Let's put it off to a good start, you know what I mean?
[274:06.72]Because shit was rough.
[274:08.05]It was really rough in 2020.
[274:20.05]CatboyJerma is going to win every time.
[274:23.22]You have to cosplay as CatboyJerma if he wins.
[274:28.31]I have to cosplay as Catboy Jerma if they win.
[274:35.57]I'm going up against my, like, broken, wrapped-up body cast character.
[274:43.54]What?
[274:44.94]Oh, hold on a second there.
[274:46.88]Wait a minute.
[274:47.34]Let's make this interesting.
[274:48.86]Why don't we make this interesting?
[274:52.86]Why don't we?
[274:55.32]So, if...
[274:58.35]If Catboy Jerma wins, I will dress up like a Catboy.
[275:03.03]Okay?
[275:04.49]If Jerma985 wins, you shave a billion dollars off that fucking debt.
[275:12.72]I want a billion off that debt.
[275:19.80]Deal?
[275:23.09]Deal?
[275:23.21]Deal?
[275:28.85]Got a deal.
[275:31.59]We got a deal.
[275:32.83]Okay.
[275:34.09]Oh, I'm fucking ready for this one.
[275:35.17]Let's go.
[275:36.78]Let's go.
[275:37.12]Let's go.
[275:37.56]Let's go.
[275:40.40]Come on, Jeremy.
[275:43.68]Three, two, one.
[275:45.54]Do not lose this fucking match.
[275:47.22]No, no, no.
[275:47.46]Don't restart.
[275:52.52]Let's go.
[275:52.88]I don't want to dress up as Catboy Jerma.
[275:56.39]Good start, Jerma985.
[275:59.71]Shave a billion off this debt for the love of God.
[276:03.28]Good start.
[276:04.02]Good start.
[276:04.52]Very good start.
[276:11.94]Just throw him around the ring.
[276:15.06]Just toss him outside.
[276:16.41]Toss him outside.
[276:17.05]Toss him.
[276:17.51]Smash him through the table right now.
[276:20.49]Cheating.
[276:20.83]What do you mean cheating?
[276:21.47]I'm not cheating.
[276:22.31]You saw the stats.
[276:25.75]Through the table right now, please.
[276:28.21]Through the table right now.

[277:36.39]No, you're doing fine.
[277:37.93]You're doing okay.
[277:42.55]You're going to be just fine.
[277:43.65]Just overthrew the table.
[277:51.06]Not much health left from Catboy.
[277:54.62]Get that table, Germo.
[277:56.84]Get it in here.
[278:02.06]Do not have this blow back in your face.
[278:05.80]It's not what should be happening right now.
[278:08.19]Okay, whatever.
[278:08.91]Set that table up.
[278:09.83]And one of you... When I say one of you, I mean me.
[278:16.83]Jeez.
[278:24.12]Catboy Redemption incoming?
[278:25.70]No, I hope not.
[278:27.18]I really don't want to dress up as Catboy Jerma on stream.
[278:32.61]Going for the table.
[278:33.27]Oh, shit.
[278:37.32]Oh, shit.
[278:38.50]Oh, shit.
[278:39.16]Oh, shit.

[278:40.32]Oh, shit.
[278:40.90]Oh, shit.
[278:41.32]Oh, shit.
[278:41.76]Oh, shit.
[278:42.16]Oh, shit.
[278:43.12]Reverse it.
[278:44.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[278:45.36]No, no.
[278:46.18]That was a double reversal.
[278:48.17]Double reversal.
[278:50.71]Okay, get... What are you... What are you doing?
[278:54.27]What are you doing?
[278:58.18]Do not.
[278:59.82]Get up and fight.
[279:02.38]Get up and fight.
[279:10.66]Nice reversal.
[279:11.52]This is it.
[279:12.50]Through the table.
[279:13.06]Do it.
[279:14.42]Powerbomb.
[279:14.98]Suplex.
[279:16.59]Suplex through the table.
[279:18.47]Please.
[279:20.63]Do something!
[279:23.11]What are you doing?
[279:24.53]You fucking idiot!
[279:33.39]Oh, my God.
[279:36.45]Just roll off the table.
[279:40.25]Good, good, good, good.
[279:40.91]Right in the gut.
[279:41.29]Right in the gut.
[279:41.65]Again.
[279:41.95]Again.
[279:42.09]Do it again.
[279:46.02]Onto the table.
[279:48.88]What?
[279:49.32]You didn't put him on?
[279:51.14]Put him on the table.
[279:52.28]Put him on the table.
[279:53.68]Do it.
[279:54.74]Do it.
[279:55.00]Good.
[279:55.28]Very good.
[279:55.66]This is it.
[279:56.92]This is it, right?
[279:58.38]This is it.
[279:59.68]This is it.
[280:00.08]I'm going to win.
[280:00.72]I win.
[280:01.14]I win.
[280:06.82]Take a billion dollars off that debt right now.
[280:09.90]Take a billion dollars off right now.
[280:12.32]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[280:14.08]I win, I win, I win, I win, I win.
[280:17.42]That's $1 billion.
[280:18.78]Ooh, and I put a lot up for that one.
[280:25.23]Jeremy Emerson.
[280:31.12]I put a lot up.
[280:32.32]I was going to dress up like Jerma Catboy on stream.
[280:35.36]The entire thing.
[280:36.89]The whole thing.
[280:42.59]Double or nothing.
[280:43.93]Wait a minute.
[280:45.59]Wait a minute.
[280:46.13]Double or nothing.
[280:46.67]What do you mean?
[280:48.48]How does that work?
[280:51.92]Two billion off the debt or I have to stream two days in a row as Jerma Catboy.
[281:07.20]Catboy for a year.
[281:08.46]That's not happening.
[281:11.32]It's not worth it.
[281:12.14]No, I'm not doing it.
[281:12.74]It's not worth it.
[281:13.36]I know.
[281:14.14]No, I'm sorry.
[281:14.76]I just tapped you a little bit.
[281:15.78]I'm not doing that.
[281:16.70]I know when to stop.
[281:17.46]That's it.
[281:19.76]Shave it off.
[281:24.62]Not doing it.
[281:27.68]That's two.
[281:28.34]Nope.
[281:28.76]I win.
[281:33.52]So many.
[281:34.28]50 million points.
[281:35.22]Oh, my God.
[281:37.92]Double or nothing to wipe the whole thing.
[281:40.34]Oh, I don't know about that.
[281:41.42]Are you kidding me?
[281:49.32]To wipe the whole thing?
[281:50.92]The debt is clear.
[281:53.56]If I win here.
[281:58.41]Can I call in a wild card?
[281:59.57]Does it have to be German 985?
[282:00.81]Can I call in a... Can I phone a friend here?
[282:07.63]No, it has to be me.
[282:20.27]Let's go.
[282:28.87]This is for all the marbles right here.
[282:41.11]It's me.
[282:41.83]It is me.
[282:45.25]Go.
[282:45.45]I have to be at this high school arena?
[282:53.69]No deal.
[282:54.27]No deal.
[282:55.61]What do you mean no deal?
[282:56.33]We're going to have to pull this?
[283:00.63]Okay.
[283:00.93]All right.
[283:01.21]Fine.
[283:01.39]Fine.
[283:01.53]Fine.
[283:01.69]Fine.
[283:01.83]Fine.
[283:01.95]We'll pull it.
[283:05.20]Remember, this is two Catboy streams in a row.
[283:08.52]Back to back.
[283:17.20]So this is, so this, it's just, is this deal or no deal?
[283:22.24]This is if I win, the debt is cleared.
[283:29.99]If I lose, I have to be German Catboy for two days straight.
[283:35.73]Let's go.
[283:36.13]Let's see what the people want.
[283:45.33]Okay.
[283:46.83]This is looking pretty unanimous.
[283:50.59]This is looking pretty unanimous to me.
[284:00.03]Either we put an end to the debt arc or we win.
[284:05.11]It's true.
[284:08.20]2020, we could put a close on it right now or it might bleed into 2021 and I have to dress up as a cat person.
[284:18.07]I don't think you guys really lose here.
[284:27.64]It is set in stone.
[284:28.38]It's a deal.
[284:30.14]That's it.
[284:32.74]67% of the vote.
[284:33.05]It's over.
[284:34.37]This is either all in.
[284:35.49]This is either two streams in a row.
[284:38.67]Okay, let's go.
[284:43.55]Go.
[284:43.79]Go.
[284:44.91]Go.
[284:46.73]Go.
[284:54.57]Predictions?
[284:55.39]Oh, I didn't know we were doing predictions for this one.
[284:58.49]Careful on your betting.
[284:59.19]Fuck.
[285:07.31]Okay, right off the bat, not good.
[285:10.41]Just go get a weapon.
[285:11.41]It's an extreme rules match.
[285:12.71]Go get a knife and just start stabbing Catboy.
[285:17.49]Just go back there and go grab a bag of trash and do the Danny DeVito.
[285:22.44]Oh, my God.
[285:23.04]It can't end like this.
[285:24.78]Go get a weapon.
[285:25.62]You can take the health down very quickly.
[285:29.64]Reversal.
[285:31.06]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[285:35.41]Don't even.
[285:38.39]Up, up, up, up.
[285:39.15]Come on.
[285:39.51]Momentum.
[285:40.67]Momentum.
[285:42.19]You idiot.
[285:43.47]Oh, my God.
[285:43.99]How'd you miss?
[285:44.33]It was point blank punch.
[285:46.25]You missed a point blank punch.
[285:51.74]Don't do a flashy move off the top turnbuckle.
[285:55.00]It's not going to do anything.
[285:55.90]You're not going to have time to do this.
[285:57.66]They're going to reverse it.
[286:02.16]It's a pretty big deal, though.
[286:02.96]That was a big move.
[286:08.18]Go get a weapon.
[286:12.88]So much riding on this.
[286:15.59]This might be the biggest bet of my online career.
[286:22.55]What am I doing?
[286:26.47]Catboy's health is not going down.
[286:33.98]Get something big.
[286:35.54]Okay, a bat.
[286:36.40]Good, good.
[286:36.96]Right in the fucking head.
[286:38.54]Right in the head.
[286:39.77]Yep, go on.
[286:40.39]Come on.
[286:41.25]Clear this shit.
[286:42.45]Clear this dead beat.
[286:43.83]Beat with a bat.
[286:45.65]No!
[286:49.01]Get up.
[286:50.29]Get the bat.
[287:01.07]Nice.
[287:01.49]Pick up the bat.
[287:02.75]You're so much weaker than Catboy Jerma.
[287:04.41]Pick the bat up.
[287:09.58]Pick up the bat.
[287:10.54]You idiot.
[287:11.32]You're just being so stupid.
[287:12.64]Pick the bat up.
[287:14.78]Oh, man.
[287:18.86]Reverse.
[287:23.78]No.
[287:28.60]Get up.
[287:31.54]Get up.
[287:34.88]Why are his armpits exposed?
[287:36.92]I don't know, dude.
[287:44.11]Get the bat and hit him.
[287:45.95]No, please do not hit him.
[287:48.09]Run.
[287:48.53]Run away.
[287:48.81]Just run.
[287:49.15]Right in the head.
[287:51.25]Quick.
[287:56.51]Good, good, good.
[287:57.74]Again, again, again.
[288:00.76]What are you doing?
[288:10.68]That was a pretty good comedy routine.
[288:13.87]It's still anybody's game right now.
[288:15.91]The health is pretty comparable.
[288:19.39]It's not a blowout in either direction.
[288:23.63]That's a big move.
[288:25.23]Pick up the bat.
[288:26.87]Forget about taunting.
[288:27.89]Finish it.
[288:28.95]Finish it.
[288:32.74]Finish it.
[288:34.48]Finish this.
[288:41.27]Nice.
[288:41.53]All right.
[288:42.83]Pin.
[288:43.41]Pin.
[288:43.89]Pin.
[288:44.13]Clear it.
[288:44.85]Clear the debt.
[288:45.83]Once and for all.
[288:46.35]Do it.
[288:52.44]Catboy, he sucks.
[288:54.92]Um, don't speak so soon.
[288:56.28]Oh, no.
[289:01.38]Go dodge.
[289:03.50]Steal it.
[289:04.30]Steal it, steal it, steal it, steal it, steal it.
[289:05.52]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[289:07.76]Oh, shit.
[289:14.93]Get up, please.
[289:17.01]Oh, thank God.
[289:18.87]Thank God.
[289:25.16]No.
[289:28.18]Fuck.
[289:30.42]Get up.
[289:31.56]Get up.
[289:33.40]It can't be.
[289:34.50]You're gonna get out?
[289:35.95]Oh no.
[289:38.49]Oh no.
[289:40.61]No.
[289:40.83]No.
[289:41.11]Oh no.
[289:41.63]Oh no.
[289:44.67]Oh no.
[289:52.18]Oh, no.
[289:54.18]Who the fuck said that?
[289:56.06]Who the fuck said that for me to do that?
[289:59.50]Who said that?
[290:00.74]I'm very upset with you.
[290:04.38]Oh, Jesus.
[290:06.51]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[290:15.15]Oh, my God.
[290:15.89]I can't catch a break here.
[290:18.54]career's over I for two streams in a row too I don't want to do that I can't believe I lost again see you in 2021 guys where cat boy germa becomes uh a real
[290:49.78]Shit.
[290:50.98]Well, I'll have to figure that out.
[290:57.67]And that's probably where I'm going to end the stream for tonight.
[291:01.55]I think that's a pretty good place to stop.
[291:08.89]Ugh.
[291:12.19]That was a lot of fun.
[291:16.57]Thanks again to all the mods that really made that possible.
[291:19.41]Because this shit was not going to be possible without them.
[291:23.93]And thanks for watching, everybody.
[291:26.94]Hopefully 2021 is better than 2020 was.
[291:35.98]Put on the fedora hat.
[291:37.42]Yeah, I'll get on cam.
[291:38.12]I'll get on cam.
[291:39.73]I'll get on cam.
[291:40.95]Put the fedora hat on.
[291:41.67]I took my... Let me turn this off.
[291:47.58]It's Catboy time.
[291:48.74]I don't have the Catboy materials here.
[291:51.06]You think I'm going to do that?
[291:51.78]How am I going to do that?
[291:54.37]I can't do that.
[291:59.53]Loud.
[292:05.19]Hit the game.
[292:05.86]Alright, let's turn the camera back on.
[292:11.54]Can you see me?
[292:17.48]Why is it so bright?
[292:21.23]Uh, hi, happy new year.
[292:24.03]Um, 2020 was kind of difficult.
[292:28.85]I, I know a lot of you know that I took like three months off, uh, because I had like the medical problem stuff.
[292:36.35]And, um, obviously the pandemic was really, really fucking annoying and horrible.
[292:42.85]It's still going on too.
[292:45.09]So I really, really hope that 2021 can just bring so much more happiness to people because 2020 has brought a lot of shitty times.
[292:52.48]So thank you everybody for making at least the 2020 for me fun.
[292:58.52]I've had a great time when I've been able to stream, when I've come on streams and everything.
[293:01.96]So it's a bright spot for me.
[293:06.35]So thank you.
[293:10.26]I'll see you guys next year.
[293:11.41]It's already next year for some of you.
[293:14.01]I got away from PST, though.
[293:16.31]Not for two hours, but... 2021, we'll have... There's a lot of streams that I was going to do in 2020 that are going to happen in 2021.
[293:26.10]The baseball stream, a couple of secret ones that I can't talk about.
[293:29.84]There's at least two or three of them that are just ready to go.
[293:32.76]And I'm excited to try them, to try to do something and try to have fun.
[293:38.97]There were a lot of subs tonight.
[293:42.01]Too many for me to even... I couldn't even keep up with them.
[293:47.27]The channel is just about to... It's all-time high.
[293:50.80]It's almost at 12,000 subs on the channel, which is fucking unbelievable.
[293:54.38]I never thought I would ever deserve something like this.
[293:57.74]I sometimes don't think I do.
[293:59.26]And I'm just really happy that you guys think this is fun.
[294:03.96]It's a lot of fucking people.
[294:04.98]It's a lot of subscriptions and...
[294:08.20]I'm just happy that you think it's fun.
[294:11.34]No one's ever obligated to give any money.
[294:12.58]I don't read donations anymore, so you don't have to give me any money if you don't want to.
[294:19.12]But it's been wild.
[294:22.28]And on top of that, I hope I can spend the money that you are giving me in a good place.
[294:30.13]I hope I'm doing good things with it, I hope.
[294:37.64]And just like that, he goes into the telephone booth and he becomes the Redditor.
[294:44.52]Types faster than a speeding bullet.
[294:46.54]Arguing with people online.
[294:53.97]100 community subs.
[294:55.53]Holy shit, dude.
[294:57.07]That's too many.
[294:58.63]That's too many.
[294:59.19]That's 100.
[295:00.51]From John Cena.
[295:02.71]I can't even read them all.
[295:04.02]I'm...
[295:06.86]Use it to buy the Catboy costume.
[295:08.36]A Catboy costume is, like, from the dollar store.
[295:10.47]It's, like, $2 for, like, the ears.
[295:12.83]And then I just need to get, like, a skirt and a... And a collar.
[295:23.77]And fishnets.
[295:27.95]Oh, no.
[295:28.69]I'm in trouble.
[295:30.79]I'm in a lot of fucking trouble.
[295:42.11]Buy a quality one, you bitch.
[295:46.43]Quality what?
[295:47.03]A quality collar?
[295:52.28]This is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.
[295:53.58]You know, this is going to follow me forever.
[295:58.10]Remember I told you that that like germa sus face?
[296:00.22]I was like, I hate that face.
[296:01.68]And then you turn it into a meme.
[296:06.05]Had nothing to do with that one.
[296:08.39]I just said I didn't like the face and you made one way more popular and way more spammable.
[296:21.08]I was going to like... No, that'd be worse face.
[296:24.90]Hold on a second.
[296:27.69]But anyways, yeah, I... Fucking impossible.
[296:32.23]Whatever.
[296:32.51]I kind of like this.
[296:34.19]I like this look without this here.
[296:37.63]Wayne the Rock just lobbed, just gave 50 community subs.
[296:41.07]That's too much money to give me.
[296:43.29]That's an insane amount of subscriptions.
[296:46.91]Catboy made.
[296:47.75]That was not part of the deal.
[296:49.03]It was not Catboy made.
[296:50.09]It was just simply Catboy.
[296:52.36]Not part of the deal.
[296:53.28]Are you trying to tack stuff on?
[296:54.40]Not going to work that way.
[296:56.60]I want you to see this.
[296:57.20]There we go.
[296:58.74]Happy New Year.
[297:01.90]The Rock in chat?
[297:02.76]Holy shit.
[297:05.62]But yeah, thanks guys.
[297:09.22]Let's go for 2021.
[297:10.02]Over the next few months.
[297:14.79]Let's hope the world can start to heal a little and get back to normal.
[297:18.95]I hope so.
[297:20.07]I don't know.
[297:20.51]I don't have a crystal ball.
[297:21.79]But I'm going to do the best I can.
[297:23.42]Because that's all I know how to do.
[297:26.16]And that's it.
[297:28.68]Much love to all of you.

[299:52.82]We're going to do the credits first.
[299:54.36]Just because I want to see how fast it's going to roll.
[299:56.22]Because it's going to be fucking crazy.
[299:58.18]So, let's take a look.
[300:00.55]Here come the credits.
[300:04.15]Laser-like speed.
[300:08.39]That's insane.
[300:14.69]Fucking ridiculous.
[300:15.95]We're not even through the bees.
[300:23.62]That's the fastest it's ever been.
[300:24.84]I really think it might be.
[300:27.44]There's been a couple times it came close.
[300:28.64]Last year, New Year's Eve came, or yeah, a year ago, it came pretty close too.
[300:34.31]To being just that fast.
[300:36.63]You guys just spoil the absolute shit out of me.
[300:41.01]I'm forever grateful.
[300:44.88]I want to give a very special shout-out to all the mods I've mentioned previously, like CrowSkinale, LeatherJacket, Cad, Grump, Clump, VRJosh.
