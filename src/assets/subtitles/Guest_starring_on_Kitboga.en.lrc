[00:03.24]There was a mistake.
[00:04.54]The money's in my account.
[00:06.28]It's yours, fair and square.
[00:07.86]Go ahead and do the chargeback, okay?
[00:11.12]I'll take it.
[00:12.11]I'll tell you how you want to give the money back to me, okay?
[00:15.55]Just give me a moment.
[00:16.87]Yes, do the chargeback.
[00:18.61]Do the chargeback.
[00:41.29]Do the chargeback.
[00:41.97]Do the chargeback.
[00:45.83]Back.
[00:47.90]Back.
[00:48.36]Do the chargeback.
[00:51.22]Back.
[00:53.44]No, I cannot put the chargeback in here.
[00:55.14]Just take your money.
[00:55.76]You said that you could do it.
[00:57.56]You said you could do it.
[00:59.28]I told you that I could do it.
[01:00.52]Do the chargeback.
[01:01.10]But right now, right now, you have to do it in the other way.
[01:05.37]I don't want to do it in the other way.
[01:07.73]Do the chargeback.
[01:09.75]No, I cannot do the child back right now.
[01:11.75]You have to do this on the other way.

[16:40.06]I don't know if I did.

[16:45.51]I don't know.
[16:48.91]Thank you, Blond Scott, Jim Jim, Condor, Lady Valkyrie, Benedict, Courtney, everyone, each and every single one of you.
[16:58.59]So, yeah, let's start off.
[17:03.27]I couldn't get the guys from Wednesday to call me today.
[17:08.95]I did try, but we may have to connect with them next week.

[17:39.69]Yeah, sure, we could do a vote for what voice to start with.
[17:44.31]So what we'll probably do... I tried to get the guys from Wednesday who were freaking out when we redeemed the cards at Best Buy.
[17:51.91]I tried to get them back on the phone, but they haven't been calling me.
[17:57.79]So it's the weekend.
[17:59.94]It's the weekend for a lot of the scammers.
[18:04.32]A lot of them aren't in the United States, and so it's like...
[18:07.73]It's not exactly Friday right now.
[18:10.98]And, um,
[18:13.95]Yeah, they might not even be in our office, but there's a that means it's the B team today So if you've never been here before if we've never been here on a Friday, we talked to a lot of scammers folks who pretend to be Microsoft or Whatever Social Security Department government officials cash app.
[18:33.01]I don't know does all kinds of things and today
[18:38.50]is special not just because Jerma is going to be here it's special because the scammers who are around today typically they're a special breed I don't know what the word is their special group I like to think of it as though they have not completed their quota for the week or they're just really desperate to to stay throughout the weekend and try to call scam try to get a victim so sometimes they're not exactly
[19:08.61]Uh, sometimes they're crazy and incredible, like at scamming and other times they're really, really bad.
[19:15.25]So we're already getting phone calls.

[31:36.82]It's like identity theft 101 type stuff.
[31:41.66]And they're trying to figure out how much you owe on cards and information that they might be able to say if they were to call the credit card company.
[31:51.29]Not that clever?

[45:19.35]Sometimes maybe if you just get the right person, I don't know.
[45:22.33]Sometimes they'll skip over that, but today they seem pretty, um, uh, serious, which is fine.
[45:40.55]Well, I mean, it's not the bummer.
[45:49.62]Yeah, remember Officer Mike?
[45:51.98]Goodness.
[45:59.30]There was this guy who we talked to for a few days named Officer Mike who... Yeah, actually, didn't he give us three or four different bank accounts and stuff?
[46:13.04]He wanted us to send... He wanted us to put money, like, mail him money.
[46:17.60]He wanted all kinds of stuff.
[46:20.97]today to refund your money back as we are shutting down our business press one to get the refund okay I'm just listening to a few voicemails I wonder if I wonder if we should do this wait why are we what's the d colon about what did I what did I just miss
[46:46.18]Oh, did it sound like we are killing you today instead of we are calling you today?
[46:52.12]Is that what it sounded like?
[46:54.76]Has it got cut off?
[46:58.97]Or are we just all decoloning?
[47:00.65]Okay.
[47:01.21]You know what?
[47:01.59]I'll do it.
[47:01.83]The department is filing lawsuit against you.
[47:05.07]An arrest warrant has been released on your name.
[47:07.81]Oh, they called me and left a voicemail this time.
[47:10.57]Let me check.

[47:21.64]That's loud.
[47:22.22]Alright, let me call...
[47:39.96]So what we'll probably do now is I'm going to call a couple of these refund scammers.
[47:45.40]We spend a lot of time talking to them.
[47:47.70]They claim to be from the Microsoft refund department.
[47:51.41]They say that they owe you $300 for something that you previously purchased.
[47:56.43]They want to connect to your bank.
[47:57.99]They want to fake send you money.
[48:02.55]I'm gonna call a couple and just like start it off.
[48:06.90]See how things are going and then Maybe we'll yeah, just have like, you know, what actually hold on a sec Hold on one second
[49:06.62]Sorry, I'm fake typing I'm fake typing
[49:34.57]I think what we'll do is so normally I
[49:39.65]Think instead of me just like starting off a call and having Jerma join later if it sounds like he might be around Wow, I look really I look really good today.
[49:50.62]Um Maybe we'll just start off some calls together if he's If he's around instead Well, let me I don't want to put no pressure dream if you're listening.
[50:02.74]Oh
[50:15.68]I'm gonna let me make sure I have everything set up.
[50:19.56]It should be fine.
[50:20.74]But um, so today's guest well, let me I'm a professional obviously I have everything all figured out Hello

[51:25.39]so um normally yeah normally I just like give guests a time so they can I don't know so we have something scheduled and so sometimes I'm like halfway through a call when that time comes but since I'm not already on a call why don't we just kind of hang out for a few minutes and then just get on some calls and see what happens yeah I'm I'm down for whatever man that's kind of my thought I can hear myself oh let me fix that I'm sorry um

[52:47.82]Yeah, I
[52:49.33]There's been a lot of people just spamming your emotes today, which gives me a lot of joy.
[52:53.77]So it's good to see it.
[52:57.37]You'll like to see it.
[52:59.53]You'll love to see it.
[53:00.49]Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[53:02.51]However you want to pull me in, however you want to do this, you just throw me something and I'll lead it up.
[53:07.53]Yeah, I think what we'll do is we'll just start a call together as whatever we want our situation to be.
[53:17.35]I'll just say like,
[53:19.39]On call with.
[53:21.61]There.
[53:22.13]Now people won't ask me I'll stream.
[53:27.22]We'll just start a call together.
[53:30.51]Okay.
[53:31.59]Yeah, and we'll make a scenario up, and we'll go for it.
[53:36.77]Before that, though, really quick, if for some reason you guys don't know who Jerma is, do you want to give us a little bit of your background?
[53:44.99]You're an ex-Tuber, correct?
[53:47.70]I am an ex-Tuber.
[53:48.76]That's correct.
[53:50.56]I was on YouTube for about five years.
[53:53.94]Made the jump over to Twitch, and I've been doing it pretty much full-time.
[53:57.36]I put that one in quotes.
[53:59.54]I stream probably three or four days a week.
[54:01.82]But I'm happy every day that I made the switch.
[54:04.30]I have a ton of fun doing live stuff.
[54:08.05]I played TF2 and made an update video and accidentally got popular like eight or nine years ago.
[54:13.79]So that's kind of what happened.
[54:16.37]Accidentally got popular.
[54:18.31]I feel like there's a lot of people who share a very similar story.
[54:22.01]It's like, what is happening right now?
[54:28.34]TF2 is one of the greatest games of all time if you've never played it.
[54:30.48]I'm sure you have.
[54:31.40]I have, yeah.
[54:34.60]I wasn't good at it, but much fun was had playing it, that's for sure.
[54:39.87]Yes, XTuber, like the X games.
[54:44.71]We all get on bikes and ride down big hills and do tricks and stuff.
[54:50.80]Was there any particular reason that you decided to switch from like the YouTube?
[54:57.40]Because you did a lot of sort of sketch stuff at times.
[55:01.30]Did you switch over to Twitch for any particular reason or just?
[55:06.07]Oh, I think I just I needed to stay interested.
[55:08.59]Yeah.
[55:08.83]And jumping to a live platform was just, you know, I've never done that before.
[55:12.91]I think I'm going to do that.
[55:15.24]nice and plus youtube at the time was kind of youtube kind of was going down uh kind of a weird path they were demonetizing channels and videos and that was right at the peak of the new youtube so I was like I might as well try this live thing out I guess we'll see what this button does
[55:36.23]There's a lot of people in chat who just keep saying like, don't let him on.
[55:40.37]He's crazy.
[55:41.13]He's a madman.
[55:42.53]It makes me laugh.
[55:43.79]Why am I such a psychopath?
[55:47.79]I'm sure you've read the like I was gonna read this before uh if you're just like I'm sure you've read the fandom or like the lore type stuff about you before but that's yeah that's funny like an undisclosed location and all this like yeah I'm some like caged alien
[56:09.31]Through an elaborate catalog of illusions, pre-recorded streams, and lookalikes.
[56:13.86]Holograms.
[56:14.82]It's like Area 51.
[56:15.64]I feel like I'm an alien that they've captured.
[56:19.22]Yeah.
[56:22.14]It's wonderful.
[56:22.84]He's the predator.
[56:27.66]Lots of people... I feel like a bunch of people...
[56:31.47]whenever I mentioned you this past week or two, people just start chanting the rat song.
[56:39.40]Have you heard it?
[56:40.50]I have.
[56:43.02]Have you done a TikTok dance to it?
[56:46.52]I haven't gotten that integrated with the culture.
[56:48.86]No, I haven't gotten that.
[56:52.36]But I have watched the movie and I tried to fully... There are multiple movies.
[56:58.05]Sorry, I watched Rat's...
[57:00.70]The Bratz movie to the movie, I think is what it's titled or something like that.
[57:05.12]Bratz movie.
[57:07.15]I say this every single time.
[57:08.33]I cannot believe that those two things are just that.
[57:13.67]People find them that interesting.
[57:15.99]I got like drunk for two weeks and made them, I think.
[57:19.33]Yeah, I was gonna ask, did you do all of the 3D?
[57:24.16]This is stuff I don't know.
[57:25.24]Sorry.
[57:26.84]It's an old Windows program called 3D Movie Maker.
[57:29.81]Okay.
[57:31.85]actually pretty awesome like one of the best creative outlets back in like the mid 90s it was unbelievable you could have cars driving down roads you could have explosions you could have people talking you could do your own voices you could talk in a mic it was one of the first programs to do it really and it was what was it called windows 3d movie making a windows 3d movie maker I remember windows movie maker but not windows 3d movie maker
[57:59.02]Yeah, Windows 3D Movie Maker is different.
[58:03.10]Oh, do I have a photo of Jerma?
[58:05.42]Do you guys need a visual reference?
[58:11.03]I have one special request.
[58:12.57]If you're going to pull a Google image search of my name, can you please pick the second image and not the first one?

[59:16.45]Geez.
[59:20.26]I wonder if there's a way to yeah have you looked into like ways to remove that other one from the internet like well not remove it but uh there might be ways when you remove one two pop up and when you remove two ten pop up and remember when you remove ten a thousand take their place
[59:40.76]not right next to each other.
[59:41.64]No.
[59:42.40]Yeah, because there might be ways to at least get Google to not display it as the first one.
[59:46.43]But yeah, I mean, if they're on a mission, if people are on a mission, there's nothing you can do about it.
[59:51.21]No, the worst part about those is when you meet somebody new, and they finally figured out what you do.
[59:57.97]Oh, you what your streamer is like, yeah, I am a streamer.
[60:00.43]You don't have to Google my name or anything.
[60:02.47]You know, you know what I look like.
[60:03.69]I'm right in front of you.
[60:04.71]You don't need an image of anything.
[60:05.97]I'm here.
[60:07.99]you know they're gonna go back to the house yeah they're gonna go back they're gonna Google my face and they're gonna be like oh my what oh man I thought you were normal I thought you were normal I mean but is it yeah is it good to be normal I don't know um wait is this the first one I feel like people need to oh wait that's not the first one sorry crap no I'm like it's so bad I mean no that was that that's the
[60:36.08]you did specifically I mean people you know everyone's googling it right now so it really doesn't yeah I know whether or not everyone's already seen it it's okay yeah evil evil Jerma yeah there it is yeah I just look old and sweaty and I hate this picture more than anything but it works for today it'll work for um
[61:00.31]Yeah, it does work for today.
[61:01.89]Chatting with the scammers.
[61:03.65]Yeah.
[61:05.31]It looks like... So why make emotes with those pictures, though?
[61:08.93]I mean... I haven't... Wait.
[61:12.10]There are no emotes on my channel allowed with that image.
[61:15.74]Oh, I guess it's just the... Yeah, that is a doctored image.
[61:22.49]The thing one is doctored.
[61:23.59]Okay, yes.
[61:26.65]I actually thought it was real for about 30 minutes.
[61:31.20]It's beautiful.
[61:31.96]It's beautiful.
[61:35.32]Where is his face?
[61:38.50]It's right on him right now.
[61:41.10]But yeah, no camera today.
[61:42.18]We're just chilling voice.
[61:43.79]I mean, people who have watched my stream before, occasionally I have people join who just do voice anyway.
[61:50.35]Or like, well, I'll be on a call and I'll say, oh goodness, I need a banker or I need
[61:55.44]neighbor or I need my girlfriend whatever it is and I just pull somebody and so Yeah, it'll be it'll be great.
[62:02.62]You guys know what you know what we're you know what we're doing for those of you who maybe haven't been here before or
[62:09.22]are like super Jerma fans Jerma fan I was gonna say germaphobe for a minute uh Jermamites Jermamites okay if you're Jermamites and you haven't been here thanks for taking a couple minutes to come hang out for one but the goal of today I guess is just to kind of laugh and have some fun and call some scammers and see what sort of shenanigans we we can get into all while keeping them on the phone so my goal is like
[62:38.94]keep them on the phone see what their script is so we can learn a little bit about the scams but then what I'm really excited about today with you is I feel like you have all kinds of just crazy weird situations and you roll with it and you're very very creative in that
[62:56.51]So I figured we'll just pick a couple of characters and call some numbers and see what happens.
[63:03.99]Give us a time, a place, and a person, and let's go.
[63:07.17]Yeah.
[63:09.43]I've heard your grandpa voice, which is great.
[63:12.35]That's me.
[63:13.89]That's this one right here.
[63:16.13]I'm ready to rock and roll whatever you want.
[63:17.74]You want this guy.
[63:18.50]You want this guy to show up and start just fumbling all over the place.
[63:22.74]There's no idea what's happening.
[63:24.35]maybe falls down at one point and gets up to start tripped on something.
[63:28.14]I'm okay.
[63:28.78]I'm still alive.
[63:29.86]I'm still alive.
[63:30.84]It'll be perfect.
[63:31.74]Yeah.
[63:32.06]Yeah.
[63:33.12]So we could have the two, um,
[63:36.34]Yeah, I could play, or I do some different, like, I pitch my voice a little bit higher and could play your wife or your love interest, whatever it needs to be.
[63:48.57]And I got a GoXLR, too.
[63:52.01]So if you're like, hey, can you pitch down and be like a demon character?
[63:55.59]I don't know why a demon would be getting called from a scammer.
[64:00.21]But you can do it.
[64:01.17]Yeah.
[64:01.94]Yeah, I mean, I can do it.
[64:03.32]Okay.
[64:04.02]I can absolutely do it.
[64:06.15]Anything you need, if you need me to go here, if you need me to go there, I can go anywhere.
[64:10.25]Perfect.
[64:11.11]Sometimes the, yeah, sometimes like adding a little bit of a filter to it can help, but I think we're, yeah, I think we're fine.
[64:20.67]Yeah, if you want me to kind of match your, if you're going to do kind of that, this style, to sound like we're both on the same telephone.
[64:30.12]Yeah, oh, that's perfect.
[64:31.18]Wow.
[64:31.98]We are on the same tempo.
[64:33.28]I have a Galaxy R2, so, wow.
[64:37.80]Yeah, we can audio match.
[64:42.40]Someone said to do slime guy voice.
[64:44.61]Is that?
[64:44.91]Yeah, that's not really set up right now.
[64:48.33]Okay, well.
[64:50.01]It's just yelling with a bunch of effects filters on.
[64:55.67]I don't want to blow out everybody's speakers.
[64:58.95]Bugleberry?
[65:00.09]Bugleberry?
[65:00.90]Oh, Bugleberry.
[65:01.76]You don't want to hear Bugleberry.
[65:03.52]People will leave.
[65:05.84]Listen, half the people here are here for you anyway right now.
[65:08.56]They're not here for Bugleberry though.
[65:10.94]They're not here for Bugleberry.
[65:12.80]They will leave.
[65:13.49]5,000 people will drop if I do Bugleberry.
[65:18.91]How many voices would you say?
[65:20.43]How many characters...
[65:23.36]would you say that you've done like a rough estimate characters like 30 voices three you know it could be a variation of something like this where you know you get into this and you start talking or it could be something like this you know you take that same thing you roll it you get a little bit higher I see what you're saying but it's still like the bass like a bass voice or something
[65:50.18]but you're tweaking it what people are saying it's it's Mr. Satan like 12 different ways yeah yeah because I guess if I kind of do like an old man
[66:01.42]but you can um like add different yeah like more voicey or more airy or something I have a I have a range with three different voices or four different voices but okay and you like pull them out all the time um and you like like different accents or country twangs or different things like that yeah I can do whatever you need if you want to talk like this I can't the whole day okay do you talk like you want to like somewhere that's not here
[66:30.02]I'm just trying to make sure we know the full arsenal.
[66:34.40]Even if it's terrible, I will try.
[66:36.78]So if you're like, hey, can we get an Irish guy in here?
[66:40.34]Of course, I can try to do that for you.
[66:41.97]I don't know how good it's going to be, though.
[66:43.49]It could be pretty bad.
[66:44.21]It could be terrible.
[66:45.53]That's good enough.
[66:45.99]I'm going to try to do it and run the list.
[66:48.93]This is great, man.
[66:49.57]I'm going Australian.
[66:50.35]Oh, I'll just go into it.
[66:51.55]You know, it doesn't matter.
[66:52.81]Whatever you throw at me, I will get it wrong.
[66:56.46]That's all we need.
[66:57.77]That's the plan.
[66:58.57]So the beautiful thing is that
[67:01.45]all we need to do like we don't need to sell it to Twitch we just have to sell it to the scammers so oh yeah like I they were trying to teach me the other day that if I say like um rise up lights is how you would say razor blades rise up rise up lights right rise up lights rise up lights and I'm terrible at accents like that but the scammers don't know the difference so
[67:28.43]Yeah, you could have so many just wrong dialects that they just want your money.
[67:34.02]They don't care.
[67:36.10]Even if you're doing a pretend accent, I feel like you have a lot more knowledge about this than I do.
[67:40.24]But even if you're pretending, it's like, I don't care that you're pretending.
[67:43.80]I just want the money.
[67:44.92]Yeah, exactly.
[67:45.94]Yeah.
[67:47.36]As long as we can sell that we're whatever, older folks or whatever it is, they don't care.
[67:55.88]well I mean yeah I mean I think it usually works really well if we play um at least somebody is a little bit older character like middle-aged to older because they're thinking that we have more money and maybe aren't as tech savvy so um you know if if we're gonna play younger like kids or something it doesn't
[68:18.52]doesn't really work so yeah they can be side characters so we could try today if we get the right scammer we could try to periodically just like oh hold on let me I gotta go to the bathroom here's my son we could always do that just like transfer the phone but hey that means we have four characters yeah we'll just that's not funny anyway so yeah chat any particular wait auto
[68:47.89]auto auto is this one that's just okay the auto voice is just how everybody talks to their dog that's all it is it's just that I talk to my dog like this voice trying to think of the who's the good boy voice yeah who's a good boy yeah that's all it is not particularly uh hard to do I guess awesome well I mean
[69:19.02]think if we just decide on a scenario like you said um normally that's all I do we try to set the stage a little bit like um chant why don't you give us some ideas I think I'm I am way better at just throwing it together than coming up with some like scripted plans so yeah if we like sometimes I've been playing uh more of a
[69:42.77]Some sort of Boston or Long Island kind of accent like that.
[69:46.83]I could always, I could do that one.
[69:49.23]Or just simple grandma kind of voice.
[69:57.13]And you can play grandpa.
[69:59.45]And we're married, we're retired.
[70:02.39]Well, we've been retired for a long time.
[70:05.57]We've been retired for 20 years.
[70:06.75]Well, actually, maybe it's 40 years.
[70:09.63]I don't know.
[70:10.76]It's been probably 60.
[70:12.64]I can do yeah we'll see what kind of it's it'll be perfect that should be good yeah we can yeah somebody broke the computer so they can't the context is that you might be able to um uh back the filter off a little bit but it doesn't really matter either way yeah that's what I'm gonna do
[70:34.76]um we could also yeah we'll just try a few things we'll just run with it it all gets blurred together you know later through the voip type stuff too so yeah um
[71:01.27]You should pick her over trivial things.
[71:03.49]I think, yeah.
[71:04.51]I think that'll come naturally.
[71:07.75]Two frat bros get a cute... Oh, sorry.
[71:11.25]Do you hear that already?
[71:12.35]I just get... Yeah, yeah.
[71:13.61]I get random phone calls.
[71:16.21]Oh.
[71:17.63]They're scammers.
[71:20.93]Do you just keep it on sometimes just to see how many you get in a day?
[71:24.57]Yeah.
[71:25.13]Not even streaming?
[71:26.59]Yeah.
[71:27.03]Well, one time... So...
[71:29.17]The current kind of record, not that I usually keep track of all of them, but we had these guys, these two or three guys.
[71:35.38]I play a character like this sometimes.
[71:40.40]Her name is Edna.
[71:43.94]She's just an elderly, gullible woman.
[71:47.02]And they spent...
[71:49.34]we were on the phone with them live for 36 hours like across a couple a couple weeks but they they called me 1500 times like what yeah like I didn't answer them obviously but just like non-stop called me like for two or three weeks because they wanted them 1500 times yeah yeah
[72:13.80]I don't think if I called you right now and didn't stop hung up and called you again for two I don't think I could call you 1500 times that's like well it was like three different people doing that yeah three or four different people it was a couple different phone numbers and they could have been using some auto dialers or something but still it's like the time investment you know of those guys unbelievable yeah all the stories I could tell
[72:40.14]um is the pic no yeah it's just a picture no video so yeah why don't we just be frozen um why don't we just be in a nice old uh couple and nice old couple
[72:57.40]Yeah, nice old couple.
[72:58.26]We'll try that, see how it goes.
[72:59.74]We can always later switch it up, like some people.
[73:02.14]Someone was saying, I've tried to do, yeah, like if people want to do college kids or we could just use our own voices.
[73:09.22]Yeah.
[73:10.94]Like, hey, man, what's going on, bro?
[73:13.61]I feel like.
[73:14.43]Yeah, we could wing it.
[73:17.75]I can put like a bunch of cans all over the ground and just waddle all over them and be like, yo, man, what's going on?
[73:22.43]Who's calling you?
[73:24.45]I feel like there's way too many.
[73:27.58]6 a.m.
[73:27.82]Break, dude.
[73:30.88]Yeah, I have a number that pretends to be Cash App.
[73:34.81]Like some scammers who pretend to be cash apps.
[73:36.53]So we could always call them later as college kids trying to pay some bet we made.
[73:40.45]Or whatever.
[73:42.37]Pay off some bet.
[73:43.01]Nice.
[73:43.95]Well, let's start off with the scammers who claim to be giving us money back from a previous purchase that we made with a product.
[73:57.14]So they pretend to be Microsoft or Best Buy or something like that.
[74:00.95]And they'll say...
[74:03.07]Hey, we owe you $399.
[74:05.13]And so we'll call them and just say like, what's this voicemail all about?
[74:10.85]Are we getting $399?
[74:13.52]You owe us money somehow.
[74:15.48]Yes.
[74:16.16]Yeah.
[74:17.08]And then they'll want to connect to our bank and I have a fake bank and then they'll, the premise is,
[74:25.04]If they owe us $300, they'll accidentally send us $3,000 by editing the HTML in the bank.
[74:33.96]And then they'll say like, oh God, go get us gift cards or go wire transfer money to my account or something like that.
[74:41.81]Yeah.
[74:43.51]That's so ridiculous.
[74:44.89]Yeah.
[74:45.21]If you want to give that one a try, we'll just kind of see how it goes.
[74:49.64]Sure.
[74:49.96]Yeah.
[74:50.56]Cool.
[74:51.86]What do you want your name?
[74:53.20]What should...
[74:54.28]I'll probably, yeah, I'll play some kind of grandma, I guess, if that works for you.
[74:59.98]If it works for me, I mean, I could be Dale.
[75:05.27]If you need me to be Dale, I could do that for you.
[75:08.49]Okay, Dale, sweetie.
[75:10.99]Yes, thank you, honey.
[75:13.63]And who are you again?
[75:15.33]What's your name?
[75:16.13]Who should you be?
[75:18.40]real name exposed um yeah I could be so if I do this voice I normally say bernice anders because the scammers say bernie sanders and it makes me laugh um or I could um should I do this one or I don't I don't know it doesn't matter it doesn't matter um yeah so I will probably just be uh bernice yeah
[75:48.41]Wait, you can do Bernie?
[75:51.47]Can I do Bernie Sanders?
[75:53.93]Of course I can do Bernie.
[75:55.22]If you need me to be Bernie, just show up and say, excuse me, are all these gift cards going to go to everybody?
[76:02.04]They're not just going to go to one person.
[76:04.40]That would be something I am not all about.
[76:05.98]I am once again asking you for your support.
[76:08.51]I am once again asking for you to send your gift cards to me and everybody I know.
[76:14.46]exactly well this is perfect yeah yeah so yes bernice and bernie anders maybe we'll just do that bernice and bernie anders not sanders okay cool I love it gosh I'm I feel like I could just sit here and talk to you about all of the possibilities all day and still enjoy it but what's
[76:41.72]There are calls to make, right?
[76:44.81]Yeah, let's do it.
[76:47.46]We'll just kind of wing it and
[76:50.51]Um, as you, I think I told you this before, but seriously, no pressure.
[76:53.97]We'll just hang out, have fun.
[76:55.28]And if the way the audio is routed, um, I can like, I can make it so the scammers can't hear us and we can still talk and, and all that if we, if we need to have sidebars.
[77:06.36]So yeah, let's do it.
[77:08.58]When you do that, just, just let me know if I'm coming through too.
[77:11.22]Cause if you, if you were like, Hey, this, this, this, and I'm like, Oh yeah.
[77:13.93]So, uh, what did you say?
[77:14.93]What'd the scammer say?
[77:16.41]oh right yeah I don't want to like I don't want to blow the whole thing I've done that before but yeah yeah yeah okay are you in that um I'll add you in that channel too there's some people who will help if we need to remember this camera's names and stuff but yeah yeah I'm in that channel now this would be fun awesome okay alright well I'll call him up bernice and bernie anders we'll we'll try

[86:26.09]That's kind of a lot of money.
[86:28.33]I'm a big computer guy.
[86:30.17]I love being on the computer.
[86:31.87]That's probably...
[86:33.56]That's 20 or 30 different PC games.
[86:36.00]We could play together.
[86:37.34]Yeah, well, that's actually true.
[86:39.10]I remember we used to play, what was it, Pez?
[86:42.53]Oh, no.

[87:21.09]Sometimes it just takes a minute The windows I could also just try maybe we could switch it up and do like a typical Hold on a second There's some guys that just pretend to be brother printer or malware bytes or Dell kind of Mm-hmm people
[87:48.84]And they're usually not as long or complicated, but we could start off with one of those.
[87:52.68]Just say, our printer's not working.
[87:54.87]Help us out.
[87:56.41]And they'll want to connect and pretend.
[87:58.71]They'll make it up and say that we have hackers and crap.
[88:05.49]Yeah, that sounds good.
[88:06.93]Yeah, we'll try that first.
[88:12.52]Jerma is doing fine.
[88:15.10]So you can just...
[88:17.49]You want me to slow down?
[88:18.85]No.

[88:41.86]And it doesn't really matter why.
[88:44.72]We were trying to print...
[88:46.89]Receipt from something.
[88:48.89]It doesn't really matter.
[88:49.85]Whatever you whatever we want the problem.
[88:52.23]We could try the same thing Actually, I'll call them and I'll say and when they say oh, can you be in front of your computer?
[88:57.25]Oh my husband's in the other room trying to think right now.
[89:00.42]I think that's a natural way to To do it
[89:17.87]Thanks for calling Brother Printer Support.
[89:19.55]This is Brian.
[89:20.09]How can I help you?
[89:22.35]Hi, Brian.
[89:23.65]How are you?
[89:25.53]I'm sorry to call you.
[89:26.48]I know it's getting later in the afternoon here, but could somebody from the support department help me out with my printer?
[89:39.74]Sure, we can definitely help you out.
[89:41.96]May I know what exactly is the problem that you're facing with the printer?
[89:45.25]I don't know, it's just between you and I, my husband, he's in the other room right now.
[89:53.44]He's been working on it all night, all morning.
[89:56.38]He's convinced he's going to be able to fix this thing.
[89:59.14]He's got a whole toolbox spread out in the living room and he doesn't know what he's doing.
[90:06.03]I was thinking I would call and get somebody to lend him a hand.
[90:12.17]Maybe I'll tell him that you're just here to be like his guardian angel or something.
[90:21.45]But if you don't mind.
[90:23.84]I would like to ask the problem that you're facing, like when you try and print something, what exactly happens?
[90:30.60]Because we need to figure out what exactly the problem is.
[90:34.90]What kind of computer you have with which you hooked up your printer?
[90:37.77]Is that a laptop computer or a desktop one?
[90:42.47]Is it a laptop computer?
[90:43.89]Well, we have it.
[90:44.95]Do you mind if I just bring you into the other room?
[90:47.33]Because I don't.

[91:30.35]Did you bring... Hey, listen, honey, I got someone calling.
[91:34.23]It's a courtesy call from Brother Printer.

[91:39.83]It's a courtesy call.
[91:41.55]They were calling and they noticed that there was a problem with our printer and they're trying to check in and see how things are going.

[92:11.96]Yes, yes, I hear you on speaker.
[92:13.84]So, can you help us sort of... You were...
[92:17.54]You're working at Brother, and our printer's having problems, and you're going to help us.
[92:27.11]Oh, we do fix Brother printers.
[92:29.61]We fix all the printers, no matter it's a Brother printer, no matter it's a Canon printer, no matter it's an Epson printer.
[92:37.12]Oh, this guy's an expert.
[92:38.48]Tell me what exactly the problem is.
[92:42.48]Yeah, he's fixed all the printers, so that's good.
[92:46.39]Well, our problem... It was printed fine, and then it stopped printing.
[92:51.39]I thought it was a paper jam, so I pulled the paper jam, the paper stuff out, and I was trying to put it back in, take it out.
[92:57.99]I took the whole thing out, actually.
[93:00.68]My whole thing.
[93:01.56]Oh, God, is that what the plastic is all over the living room?
[93:04.39]Yeah, just don't walk over here with bare feet.
[93:06.23]You're going to get, don't, please.
[93:08.17]Yeah, oh, God.
[93:09.07]Brian, I've been doing this for the last probably six to 12 hours straight.
[93:15.29]My goodness.
[93:17.79]Alright.
[93:18.33]If you have taken all the parts apart.
[93:20.53]In that case, I really apologize.
[93:22.25]There is nothing I can do about it because we work online.
[93:26.12]So if there is any software problem with the printer, we can go ahead and fix that out for you.
[93:31.04]But the way you're telling me the problem, this is not a software problem, sir.
[93:35.00]This seems to be a hardware problem.
[93:36.68]I think you don't understand.
[93:38.27]No.
[93:40.43]When he says he took it apart, he's talking about that printer manual.
[93:45.49]There's like a manual that comes with the printer.
[93:47.75]And he's got that plastered all over the living room like a crime board.
[93:53.16]It's like a detective movie, Brian.
[93:54.82]It's crazy.
[93:56.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[93:57.08]No, the printer is fully intact.
[94:01.30]It's the manual.
[94:03.02]The printer is fully intact?
[94:04.52]Yes.
[94:05.70]Well, the printer is... No, I told you I took the paper.
[94:09.05]I took the paper out.
[94:10.35]Yes.
[94:10.75]And I was trying to fan through it, see if there was a wrong page or something.
[94:14.54]Because I heard that sometimes if you have the wrong kind of size paper, it gets all messed up in there.
[94:19.62]Yeah.
[94:20.76]Yeah.
[94:22.26]At one point when I walked in, it looked like an art class, a paper mache class.
[94:26.84]But no.
[94:29.33]Yeah.
[94:31.23]The printer's on.
[94:32.49]I mean, I can see the light blinking.
[94:34.41]But you said it still doesn't print, honey?
[94:37.69]Oh.
[94:38.75]Which light is blinking?
[94:39.93]What does it say?
[94:41.39]Do you see the light blinking?
[94:42.76]What does it say?
[94:43.98]It's just a green light.
[94:45.76]Yeah, it's just green.
[94:46.58]Just green blinking.
[94:47.32]There's going to be a symbol on it.
[94:51.90]What is this light indicating for?
[94:53.72]Oh, God.
[94:56.56]Hold on.
[94:58.44]The manual.
[94:59.38]I could open up the manual and see what it says.
[95:01.35]Yeah, let's look at the manual.
[95:03.78]He can't hear us.
[95:04.52]I don't know what to say, by the way.
[95:08.74]Power or Wi-Fi, maybe?
[95:10.76]I don't know.
[95:12.24]Yeah, Wi-Fi.
[95:14.74]I think it's Wi-Fi.
[95:16.52]Yeah, it's the Wi-Fi.
[95:19.11]Oh, the power.
[95:20.75]It says power, too.
[95:23.15]I think that's a different light.
[95:25.17]Please let him talk.
[95:25.87]Alright.
[95:28.83]Would you please help me with the model number of your printer?
[95:32.66]What do we find there?
[95:34.86]Where is that?
[95:36.40]Alright, let's do it this way.
[95:38.68]May I get your name, please?
[95:41.38]Yeah, well, I'm Bernice, and this is my husband, Bernie.
[95:47.63]Yeah, I'm behind the... Bernice, okay.
[95:49.55]Alright, Bernice, let me do it this way.
[95:54.53]I've got your number, the number you're calling from 50... Uh-huh.
[96:00.63]okay I'm gonna oh it's uh mfcl2710dw alright no problem at all so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go ahead and transfer I'm going to forward your phone number and your name to one of our senior technicians okay we will call you and like another and people have a problem for you
[96:29.69]Let's take about 15, 20 minutes.
[96:31.61]Oh, God, that's a long time.
[96:33.09]Okay.
[96:34.41]Alright.
[96:35.33]Technician, they're going to... Alright.
[96:37.85]Are they coming to the house?
[96:41.47]No, they're going to be calling you first.
[96:43.96]Let's see if they can fix it online.
[96:45.98]Okay.
[96:46.40]Alright.
[96:46.76]Thank you so much.
[96:47.52]Oh, perfect.
[96:48.50]Perfect.
[96:48.90]Thank you, Brian.
[96:49.74]Okay, Brian.
[96:50.28]Alright.
[96:50.96]Alright.
[96:52.56]You have a good one.
[96:54.36]this is sort of normal actually I forgot about this but um so he's like the gatekeeper or something he decides whether or not the next level of people should should call so so he takes like the giant net and throws it out there yes yeah um so I think we're we're in I think um we could call another place to pretending to be malware bites just to like
[97:22.08]have a couple irons in the fire as they say just to make it just in case that guy doesn't call back um well bernie the filter should I keep the filter on or take the filter off actually I've I personally thought that everything that just happened was great so okay that's my thought but yeah someone in chat said oh god I think it's a giant rat and I almost burst out laughing okay um deep voice filter
[97:52.06]No, I think everything is everything is five out of seven right now Okay, so we're gonna call back Yeah, I mean it might be yeah might be five ten minutes But what I'll what I usually do if you're cool with it is I just start another call and then yeah if the call that we're currently on is Great for some reason and we just love it.
[98:17.08]We'll keep going Otherwise, I'll just take the other call.
[98:20.64]That's usually how I do it
[98:22.77]Okay, cool.
[98:25.35]So well, I guess we could do a very similar scenario.
[98:29.17]But this time, we're calling malware bytes, because we think that we have a virus.
[98:36.03]If we want it to be rat themed, that's fine.
[98:38.84]I don't care what we do.
[98:41.56]I was like, I clicked on his rat meme.
[98:43.44]And it was so funny.
[98:46.22]It was really funny, but it might have caused a problem with the computer.
[98:52.72]It was my... It was my grandson.
[98:55.43]Michael.
[98:56.29]It was his birthday.
[98:57.53]It was Michael's birthday today.
[98:59.25]It apparently said cake and ice cream was on its way.
[99:02.33]I don't know.
[99:02.93]I think it might have gave me a virus.
[99:07.55]Okay, we'll try that.
[99:09.62]See how it goes.
[99:12.64]Whoa.
[99:24.09]Hello.
[99:26.48]Yes.
[99:26.76]Hi.
[99:27.22]Is this the malware bytes?
[99:31.38]Yes.
[99:32.07]Yes.
[99:32.53]How may I assist you?
[99:34.26]Well, I'm not really sure exactly.
[99:37.15]I'm not too good with the computers, but my husband is in the other room.
[99:45.56]He's been working on the computer all night, and now he's back at it this morning, and, you know, he just looks unstraveled, uncombed, you know.
[99:54.93]He's completely...
[99:57.47]He hasn't showered in two or three days trying to fix this, and I'm feeling bad.
[100:02.01]I talked to my neighbor, and she said that Malwarebyte is what she uses.
[100:08.97]And I thought I'd give you a call, because we're having, I think, a virus on the computer.
[100:15.37]Okay.
[100:16.35]Okay.
[100:17.85]Are you in front of your computer?
[100:20.41]No, but my husband is.
[100:21.55]I can head over there.
[100:23.75]I just want... Hold on a second.
[100:25.27]Let me...
[100:26.25]You can hand over your phone.
[100:29.29]Yeah, I'll probably just put you on speakerphone to be honest.
[100:31.96]Hey, honey, I got a guy on the phone who can help, you know.
[100:36.32]Yeah, bring it in here.
[100:37.38]I don't know.
[100:38.14]I have no idea what happened.
[100:43.54]Gosh, I really messed up this time.
[100:46.42]I really screwed up.
[100:49.48]Okay, can you hear us?
[100:53.63]From where you got our number?
[100:56.38]My neighbor said Morwarebyte was a good one, and I looked it up on the internet.
[101:04.45]Can you help him?
[101:07.21]He has a computer guy on the phone.
[101:10.71]Yeah, he's a virus guy.
[101:12.09]Can you help me with your name?

[102:13.34]At Juno.com.
[102:25.45]Yeah, b.ed is 985.
[102:28.34]Do you have your malware activation key?
[102:33.48]I have no idea what that is.
[102:35.02]Do you know what that is?
[102:35.76]What is the malware activation key?
[102:38.08]Is that...
[102:40.00]That's a license key.
[102:42.49]No, we're calling because my husband may or may have... I don't think it's his fault.
[102:48.63]It's not your fault.
[102:50.45]He clicked on something and now our computer is, as they say, kaput.
[102:56.31]It's not working.
[103:01.48]You ever go on the internet and you see those funny internet pictures?
[103:08.16]I think I got something from one of those I downloaded I went to this thing it was a rat birthday party thing and I was probably we have grandkids and we were trying to send him a birthday card exactly a thing and then my computer started freezing it started blue screen and then I I started doing I couldn't even control it anymore what is the name of your uh what is what is the name of your neighbor who gave you our number
[103:37.15]Michael.
[103:38.71]Michael.
[103:40.55]Wasn't his birthday the other day too?
[103:42.02]Michael.
[103:42.60]Send him a birthday card for me.
[103:47.68]Michael.
[103:48.72]And can you help me with the last name of Michael?
[103:51.83]Michael didn't give me your phone number.
[103:54.71]Michael told me... What is the last name of Michael?
[104:01.54]No, Michael, our neighbor, told me about Malwarebyte.
[104:05.15]That's what I'm saying.
[104:05.79]Michael, I don't even know if we know Michael's last name.
[104:11.03]He's so suspicious of like why I'm calling him.
[104:14.65]He just hung up.
[104:15.63]But some of these, I guess he was just scared maybe that like, wait, how did you get our number?
[104:21.97]Why do you want to talk to us?
[104:23.31]But that was, I couldn't contain myself.
[104:28.11]I don't know what it is my neighbor that voice why does he want the neighbor's first and last name he may have I think he got confused at one point and thought that my neighbor gave their phone number so he was thinking that it must be one of their customers and he wanted to verify that that was legitimate
[104:52.10]Um, but I think yeah, I just think he misunderstood everything that was happening.
[104:58.48]That's so funny Well, let's well maybe we'll hop on one more while we wait for those printer guys Um, do you want to try?
[105:11.17]Let's see I have some people that pretend to be quickbooks and some people that pretend to be cash app
[105:19.09]doing taxes.
[105:20.82]Yeah.
[105:21.26]So the QuickBooks ones, they actually seem kind of professional.
[105:25.74]Sometimes it's sometimes scary how like legit they sound, but then they want to, they connect to your computer.
[105:34.14]I think I have QuickBooks on here.
[105:35.86]I don't remember.
[105:37.82]I do.
[105:38.58]They connect to the, your computer and they'll tell you that, um, that your QuickBooks company file got corrupted and
[105:48.78]there's hackers on your network and you have to pay like eight grand or something to uncorrupt your company file when oh my god I don't even have a company and my quickbooks is like unregistered but that's what they do so we could potentially we could do any character we want with those because we don't have to be older if we don't want to but um work for the same company
[106:15.50]yeah yeah I mean we could be business partners we could be uh college buddies at our at our startup it doesn't doesn't really matter yeah whatever if you want to go into something elaborate like that we could be on a brewery or something yeah so we could be um oh thanks for telling me that I cut off your name accidentally um well you didn't tell me but
[106:46.42]oh the name uh yeah um yeah I'm hoping I kind of want the printer guys to call back but maybe we'll wait we'll try this that seems like a good one yeah have Jerma teach you how to do a new England accent maybe just drop just drop every r you say and replace it with a h I know uh
[107:12.33]Raw rags.
[107:14.93]Is it raw rags?
[107:16.27]Car park.
[107:17.71]Car park.
[107:18.99]My car keys.
[107:21.60]Car keys.
[107:22.46]I left my car keys in the car park.
[107:25.96]Room.
[107:26.62]You go to your room.
[107:27.52]Room.
[107:27.94]You get on the roof.
[107:29.90]I try to do it.
[107:30.71]I just end up doing a little bit of long island...
[107:33.48]the long I I mix it up with a couple they're all the same they're on the same east coast kind of vibe I'll say keys in the cab park but also say uh what is it lobster instead of like lib I don't know how you would say it lobster lobster lobster lobster labs I say lob instead of whip
[107:58.19]It's little things like that.
[107:59.71]Lobster.
[108:00.43]Lobster versus lobster.
[108:02.23]Yeah.
[108:02.81]Lobster is probably... Who knows?
[108:06.49]I just make it up and say it's Long Island and intentional, but I have no clue what I'm doing.
[108:12.69]Let's try... Yeah, we have our business startup, and we'll see if the other guys call back in a couple minutes.
[108:23.36]I hope that's okay.
[108:24.20]Sorry it's not...
[108:26.35]It's like fishing.
[108:27.91]I'm having fun.
[108:28.59]This is awesome.
[108:31.15]Me too.
[108:34.35]Oh, I have the appeal.
[108:37.52]Yeah, it's, it's fun to just sit down and like, try goofy things every day.
[108:42.34]But then also know, in the back of your mind, you're like, Oh, well, we just wasted an hour of some scammers time.
[108:50.34]I also have one that I forgot about on chat might like this too.
[108:54.85]They
[108:56.64]pretend that they're Amazon and that they have detected somebody purchased an apple iPhone on your account um an iPhone yeah and they're like oh my gosh yeah someone else must have purchased that and usually I think they are just trying to steal your Amazon account but
[109:18.07]Yeah, does either one of those interest you more than the other?
[109:20.45]Like QuickBooks versus Amazon?
[109:22.69]It doesn't?
[109:23.25]Yeah, the Amazon one sounds fun to do.
[109:26.83]That could probably be faster than the QuickBooks one, maybe.
[109:29.75]Yeah, that's true.
[109:30.81]Yeah.
[109:31.31]If we're going to get a phone call from the printer support.
[109:33.76]Oh, this could be the printer support, actually.
[109:37.12]Let's find out.
[109:37.46]Hello?
[109:37.72]Hello?
[109:50.97]Mark, and I'm calling from the printer support.
[109:54.53]How are you?
[109:55.87]Oh, perfect.
[109:56.55]I've got my husband on the call as well.
[110:00.34]Hello.
[110:02.12]Okay.
[110:02.84]Okay, ma'am.
[110:04.08]So I got to know there is some problem for the printer, right?
[110:10.42]That's right.
[110:11.16]We've got the manual, you know, all over the house.
[110:15.25]We're trying to figure out what to do.
[110:17.45]I haven't touched it since the last person called, so.
[110:20.01]Yeah.
[110:22.42]okay no problem we'll be guiding you through with some steps and we'll definitely look further for some solution but I would like to know first like what exactly the problem coming in I don't know I don't know if we know do you know honey I don't know it it just it just doesn't print the thing doesn't print okay
[110:45.18]for that case uh I need your permission to go ahead and take an access of your computer so that I can go ahead and check out the settings and help you out further would that be fine yeah yeah I think that's alright alright we don't know exactly how to do that I don't think but
[111:03.70]No problem.
[111:04.54]We will guide you through with that, okay?
[111:07.33]So just for the introduction basis, we are the expertise in Brother Printer support.
[111:13.83]So I will be helping you out to guide you through, okay?
[111:16.69]So what you need to do is just open up a new Google Chrome browser.
[111:23.58]Okay.
[111:25.84]So we should be looking at the computer then?
[111:29.96]Exactly.
[111:31.43]Do we need the manual anymore or no?
[111:32.97]Can I get rid of that?
[111:34.37]Are we going to need the reference manual for the printer?
[111:39.06]We will need it later on.
[111:41.56]But first of all, I need to check from the computer side if there's any driver issue or anything like that.
[111:47.88]We'll fix it up first and then we'll go to the manual.
[111:51.46]Okay.
[111:52.62]Okay.
[111:53.02]Yeah, it's been a while since I've seen my husband pull out one of those.
[111:55.81]But we always keep them.
[111:57.77]We always keep everything.
[112:01.03]I think we have four garage doors in here.
[112:03.15]Do you have a garage door open?
[112:07.17]Okay.
[112:08.33]Okay.
[112:08.99]So I'm just opening up the laptop.
[112:13.05]And... Sure.

[112:16.17]No problem.
[112:18.09]Okay.
[112:23.15]So, Mark, we really appreciate your time, by the way.
[112:25.89]We really appreciate your time.
[112:28.22]Thanks for doing this.
[112:29.22]No problem.
[112:30.16]It's my job.

[113:11.71]No, you type.
[113:12.64]I want to make sure if anything needs to happen to the printer, I'm right here.
[113:16.01]Yeah, you take care of the technical side.
[113:18.09]I'll take care of that.
[113:18.83]Hey, Brian, I mean, I'm lucky I haven't smashed this thing with a hammer.
[113:23.03]You know what I mean?
[113:24.29]These things are crazy.
[113:26.17]No, you don't need to.
[113:27.59]I'll definitely help you out.
[113:29.75]I can understand you have been fighting for the solution.
[113:33.99]I broke my toe the other day because I kicked it.
[113:39.24]Oh, no problem, sir.
[113:40.86]I can totally understand your frustration over it, but definitely try to help you out, okay?
[113:46.95]I really appreciate it.
[113:47.79]You have no idea how horrible it's been for the two of us.
[113:51.05]We got into little small arguments over this thing.
[113:54.14]Thank you so much for doing this.
[113:55.92]Our marriage has been perfect for years.
[113:58.76]And it's like sometimes, I don't know what it is.
[114:01.28]It's like, it's this thing.
[114:02.54]What do they call it?
[114:04.13]It's put a wedge between us.
[114:05.67]We've been actually putting it between us when we sleep at night.
[114:10.15]Mm-hmm.
[114:11.19]No problem.
[114:12.05]We need to figure out like sometimes, you know, there are some small glitches which we don't see from our bare eyes.
[114:19.83]So if we can fix it up, some small or big glitches, we can get it working for sure.
[114:26.24]Yeah, no problem.
[114:28.64]Thank you.
[114:29.60]You know, you're inadvertently fixing a marriage while you're fixing a princess.
[114:35.46]Thank you for that.
[114:36.46]God bless you.
[114:37.26]Definitely.

[117:38.81]I would say the longest one, based just on a quick skim reading, at the bottom it says save up to 20% and more 30-day trial now available in store.
[117:48.69]That one's a little bit longer.
[117:50.13]Is that the longest one?
[117:51.05]There might be a longer one above.
[117:54.07]I think you should click the other one.

[118:14.62]Yeah.
[118:17.36]Brian, what are you trying to do?
[118:21.86]We are just trying to get the access of the computer first so that we can go ahead and have a look if there is any settings or drivers that we require to get it installed to get it working.
[118:35.43]So we need to go ahead and start from the basic.
[118:38.73]Okay, he doesn't hear us for a second.
[118:40.55]Don't tell him, but I'm installing a fake.
[118:42.99]I'm going to make it look like we have a printer.
[118:44.89]Do you see the long link there?
[118:49.93]A long link.
[118:52.21]Well, I clicked it.
[118:54.53]I clicked it.
[118:55.97]Which one?
[118:58.04]It says UltraViewer now.
[119:02.04]You are on the website of UltraViewer, right?
[119:04.20]I think so.
[119:04.82]I don't know.
[119:07.12]Yeah, I think so.
[119:11.30]It says remote control.
[119:12.38]Let me tell you how to work.
[119:16.83]Okay, do you see a download option there on that website?
[119:20.76]Orange color in the orange color or a green color download?
[119:24.82]Oh, yeah.
[119:26.06]We've been learning a lot about apps.
[119:28.06]We took a class.
[119:29.68]If there's one thing that's good from us having to spend a lot more time at home is we've been trying to learn a lot.
[119:37.53]Wouldn't you say, honey?
[119:39.21]We took a couple classes.
[119:42.23]We took some app store classes.
[119:45.41]And now we can both use Candy Crush Saga on two different devices at the same time.
[119:53.66]At the same time.
[119:54.70]It's huge for us.
[119:57.42]We used to have to share.
[119:58.38]We had to go back and forth.
[119:59.38]Not anymore.
[119:59.90]This is some Tom Cruise stuff, let me tell you.
[120:03.60]Yeah, they should make a sitcom about us.
[120:06.91]That would be funny.
[120:08.45]You and I could do so well.
[120:10.23]Can you imagine that?
[120:12.41]Honestly, though?
[120:13.65]Honestly?
[120:14.43]Yeah, that would be incredible.
[120:17.03]It would be really fun.
[120:19.76]Maybe we could even involve this stupid printer.
[120:25.22]Oh, God, it could be called the printer in our hearts.
[120:29.56]No, the printer between us.
[120:32.07]Don't put the printer between the Andersons.
[120:37.91]Hey, Mark, maybe we should get you on the writing, too.
[120:43.55]Okay, no problem.
[120:46.61]You could be in the pilot.
[120:49.03]If you are on the website, you will see a green-colored tab which says Download.
[120:56.68]A tab?
[120:58.62]Is that what they put at the top?
[120:59.92]A green color button that says download.
[121:03.98]Yeah, we learned this the other week.
[121:06.08]Yeah, that's... You can open it in a new tab.
[121:08.75]Yeah, okay, so I make a new tab and now I type download?
[121:12.19]No, no, no.
[121:14.05]We don't need to open a new tab.
[121:16.81]Let me tell you once again.
[121:18.63]Let me tell you once again.
[121:20.57]What we have to do is...
[121:24.02]Oh, sorry, he's talking.
[121:25.02]What can you see on your computer screen right now?
[121:28.88]Well, I opened up a new tab, and I typed download, and now it has a video recommendation, how to download Fortnite on PC easy method, in case you were having a hard time doing that.
[121:42.34]No, no, no, no.
[121:43.74]Allegedly 752,000 people had a hard time.
[121:49.24]We have to go back.
[121:50.28]Go back.
[121:50.86]Go back.
[121:51.20]Okay, back.
[121:53.69]Mark, this is what I got to deal with.

[122:00.92]I'm there with you.
[122:01.78]Okay.

[136:18.33]Mm-hmm.
[136:19.63]Mm-hmm.

[136:44.93]I'm sorry.
[136:45.59]Do you hear an ice maker?
[136:47.31]I don't.
[136:49.49]MFC.
[136:50.51]It doesn't work.
[136:51.19]It hasn't worked in, what, six months?
[136:54.83]Sorry.
[136:55.69]Sorry, Mark.
[136:57.15]Mark's going to take care of that, too.
[136:58.37]No problem.
[137:00.49]Sure.
[137:01.09]Sure.
[137:01.79]So let me go ahead and start the process first.
[137:08.89]Oh, there's a process.
[137:09.59]Okay.
[137:13.43]Let's see.
[137:14.71]Okay.
[137:15.81]View devices and the printers.
[137:20.10]Okay.
[137:23.60]So this is the printer.
[137:34.51]Um, okay, he can't hear us.
[137:36.54]So if you've if you guys haven't seen this before sometimes I just put A printer on there.
[137:41.38]So it at least looks like we have A printer and it depends on the scammer.
[137:47.24]Sometimes they'll they're actually pretty thorough and really try to help you Um, oh sir, this is error printing other times.
[137:55.73]They just immediately say you have hackers So I put it on there
[137:59.84]Just to see what they're going to do.
[138:01.42]But either way, this is not the official brother support.
[138:04.58]It's just some random dude.
[138:09.16]So you were trying to print something through the computer or the cell phone?
[138:15.53]The computer.
[138:16.91]From the computer, yeah.
[138:17.99]You can print through a cell phone?
[138:19.49]The same computer, right?
[138:22.33]Yes.
[138:23.47]Yeah, we can print through a cell phone too.
[138:26.67]Oh, sorry.
[138:28.65]How do you print to a cell phone?
[138:30.72]Yeah, I don't know.
[138:34.00]Let me tell you that there is... Yes, we can go ahead and connect ourselves through a Wi-Fi with our cell phone and printer.
[138:44.49]We can bridge both of them, and then we can give a command from our cell phone, and we can print any document.
[138:50.01]Oh, is that what they call the...
[138:53.03]is it like the 3d printers because you got three different devices three different like your is that what the 3d stands for you can do a computer a phone basically you know uh the printers coming in these days with the internet services we can go ahead and use those printers to print from the cell phone okay so that's something we don't need any we don't need any certification from the ftc faa anything like that to do that
[139:24.81]no no nothing like that it's it's your printer and if you want to uh print something from yourself there is nothing illegal in that okay I just I gotta make sure because that I don't want to do anything illegal well yeah like with the different radio waves and the frequencies and stuff you know we got a lot of guy a lot of people there's a small airport
[139:46.71]near our house and a lot of hobbyists and young and old people who just get started flying, they fly out of there.
[139:56.48]We don't want to mess up the communications.
[139:59.86]No, no, no.
[140:00.62]Nothing like that.
[140:01.34]If I print through my phone and all of a sudden one of those kids' drones flies over, I don't want to hit the house.
[140:07.57]Yeah.
[140:09.08]That's a good point.
[140:09.96]Oh, God, that's a good point.
[140:12.70]Is this 3G, 4G, 5G?
[140:15.24]How many Gs do you need?
[140:21.00]We have till 5G.
[140:24.26]Oh, wow.
[140:25.46]Yeah, we don't have 5G, so I guess we're not going to be able to do it.
[140:29.12]Mark, I don't know how old you are, but do you remember when you used to have that?
[140:32.41]It's CW or CW.
[140:36.07]What was that, honey?
[140:36.67]Go ahead.
[140:36.93]The model number is CW or DW?
[140:41.02]That's DW.
[140:42.50]Yeah, DW.
[140:43.88]DW, right?
[140:45.64]Yes, MFC L2710DW.
[140:53.24]Got it.
[141:03.33]Does this seem like something that you...
[141:06.67]are going to be able to hint like this is a straightforward solution because I know the other day we we had an email it was like a we got this strange email from one of our friends you know when they forward you stuff and we clicked that I don't know we've always kind of no no no never when she says we well I it was I'm trying to group us together because we're a team well
[141:36.74]She clicks on everything in every email.
[141:38.68]And I always keep telling her, don't do that.
[141:40.50]Don't click on things in emails.
[141:44.48]There are spam shields which can give you viruses as well.
[141:49.73]Oh, God.
[141:54.73]I swear sometimes I stand behind her, Mark, and I just watch.
[141:59.13]And she opens email, click link, open next email, click link, open next.
[142:02.24]She's not even reading the emails.
[142:03.56]She's just clicking the links.
[142:04.60]It's like...
[142:06.06]That's what you do.
[142:07.14]Is that what that noise is?
[142:08.28]I always thought it was the chair, like having like a creaking sound.
[142:11.52]Is it you just breathing behind me while I'm on?
[142:15.52]How often do you do that, would you say?
[142:17.54]How often are you watching me?
[142:20.07]The computer's in a place where I could see you wherever you, we're in the living room.
[142:24.19]Oh, oh my God.
[142:26.11]I could just be watching TV, look over the side of my shoulder.
[142:28.19]There you are.
[142:29.37]Click, next link, click, next link.
[142:31.83]I hear screaming.
[142:32.75]I hear screams.
[142:38.01]Are you sure you're talking about me?
[142:39.23]This isn't a TV show.
[142:41.93]I am talking about the person that lives in the house with me.
[142:45.21]True, true.
[142:46.28]Which is you.
[142:47.14]True, yeah.
[142:48.34]The screaming is different.
[142:49.84]Sometimes I get excited.
[142:51.46]It's probably an excited scream.
[142:55.02]I get some good emails.
[142:57.22]Mark, have you ever seen The Exorcist?
[143:01.12]No.
[143:01.30]Oh, come on.
[143:03.61]No, I'm talking about what The Exorcist looks like.
[143:06.79]There's a picture that jumps up and it screams at you.
[143:09.35]It scares everybody.
[143:11.41]She clicks on those 10 times a week.
[143:20.14]It's unbelievable.
[143:20.72]I understand.
[143:21.30]I'm just checking about your printer.
[143:22.82]Just allow me some time, okay?
[143:24.32]I'm just working with my expert to get some help, alright?
[143:27.74]Just bear with me.
[143:29.34]Thank God.
[143:29.92]Thank you.
[143:30.52]Bye.
[143:31.54]Thank you.
[143:33.78]You're doing us a big favor here.
[143:36.86]For real.
[143:37.93]No problem.
[143:39.17]All my job.
[143:41.16]Actually, do you mind if I ask you really quick about your job?
[143:45.62]Because our grandson, he loves technology.
[143:51.11]Not as much as you, you see.
[143:54.01]But he still loves technology.
[143:55.21]Definitely.
[143:55.95]It's not hard to learn technology.
[143:58.71]You should always have a good zeal to learn something.
[144:02.35]And, you know, you can easily learn that process.
[144:05.06]You hear that?
[144:06.38]You should have some zeal to learn.
[144:08.72]He's telling you, you should have some zeal to learn.
[144:13.02]Technology scares the absolute crap out of me.
[144:16.62]That's why even stuff like this.
[144:20.97]Can you tell me what's coming in on your printer when you are turning it on?
[144:29.79]So what's coming in?
[144:31.63]Like, can you tell me what you were doing yesterday and what's the problem coming in?
[144:36.76]What error you are watching there?
[144:39.12]Tell me step by step.
[144:40.82]And I want you, sir.
[144:42.89]to talk to me uh one person at a time so that I can understand the problem and definitely help you out okay so just tell me step by step one by one what is coming up on your printer display okay on the interesting but there was a blinking button yeah we've been having problems at the whole computer for the past couple days that's why I that's why I was wondering but
[145:10.02]No problem.
[145:10.60]I'll take care of the print computer issues.
[145:13.67]Right now, first, I want to go ahead and fix the printer issues.
[145:18.05]So let's, you know, just let me know what exactly all you see on the printer display screen.
[145:28.05]I lean in here.
[145:32.01]There's nothing there.
[145:35.61]There's a blinking light.
[145:37.19]It's green.
[145:39.69]okay okay uh just do one thing yeah right there what do you need just uh turn off the printer and turn it on again turn it the whole thing off you want them to unplug it sorry I don't know if we can hear you you want them to unplug it uh no just simply power off and power on that's it
[146:08.61]Okay, yeah, he's telling me to unplug it, yank the cable out.
[146:14.45]Yeah, I do.
[146:15.87]Alright, it's currently unplugged.
[146:18.87]Yeah, my husband unplugged it.
[146:22.03]Now, do one thing.
[146:23.33]Just allow me two minutes of your precious time.
[146:25.56]I'll be back, okay?
[146:27.04]Okay.
[146:28.26]You can have three minutes.
[146:29.66]Alright, stay on the line.
[146:30.70]Stay on the line.
[146:32.16]You get unplugged?
[146:33.28]Sure.
[146:33.96]Oh, yeah.
[146:34.80]Before you go, should we leave it unplugged?
[146:36.34]Leave it unplugged and I'll be back and we'll let you know.
[146:39.52]Okay?
[146:40.06]Okay.
[146:40.50]Thank you, Mark.
[146:42.83]Be on the line.
[146:43.49]Alright.
[146:43.77]Alright.
[146:45.25]I'm muted us.
[146:48.15]Yeah, this is... I'm having a blast.
[146:50.99]Thanks, man.
[146:52.81]This is fun.
[146:55.50]Yeah, he hasn't done anything too, like, I don't know what the word would be, too scummy, or just straight out said, oh, it looks like you've got a, you know, hacker or something.
[147:09.77]But the premise for, if you guys haven't seen, because a couple people have been saying, like, Kit, this guy might be legit.
[147:16.17]It could be a joke.
[147:16.92]That's kind of a meme in the channel, but...
[147:19.92]Uh, they like spam the internet in really weird ways and say like contact official brother support but this guy isn't official brother support and if you caught a couple times he said like oh, yeah, we fixed all the printers we fixed fridges like
[147:37.44]he'll tell you he can fix anything oh yeah can you fix the defroster in the fridge like you have to be physically here to do that yeah they'll kind of promise you anything and he may try like it looks like he's sort of trying to but um either way the
[147:54.41]in the very beginning you know they're they're hoping that you believe that their brother so you talk to them which even that is wrong should we come back and say that I unplugged the fridge too I unplugged everything in the house we wait like 20 minutes and be like what's that smell oh I unplugged the fridge although 20 minutes is too short of time but yeah
[148:22.92]Oh, wait, you unplugged the fridge?
[148:24.16]We just got, like, a bunch of ground beef.
[148:26.72]Oh, well, it's okay.
[148:27.78]It'll still be good.
[148:30.56]Ground beef can be at room temperature for at least 48 hours.
[148:34.33]My great-grandmother used to eat it raw.
[148:36.55]Raw beef.
[148:40.52]I'm trying to get some printer sounds in case.
[148:44.50]I have one somewhere.
[148:46.63]Let's see if I can find it.
[148:48.03]Where it starts up and starts making a grinding noise.
[148:51.07]But he might not.
[148:52.25]Then he might just say it's a hardware problem.
[148:57.57]That was a good save at the very beginning.
[149:00.19]He's like, oh no, we don't do that.
[149:01.76]It's a hardware problem.
[149:02.72]We talked about how we took the entire printer apart.
[149:05.80]The whole thing.
[149:06.32]We ripped it apart.
[149:07.14]And then apparently it was just the manual.
[149:10.19]That's so funny.
[149:12.33]It worked, though.
[149:14.05]Oh, yeah, he tore the manual apart.
[149:15.99]Like, I ripped it up in anger.
[149:17.30]Shredded it.
[149:20.42]Yeah, scattered it all over the room.
[149:23.26]Make a beeping noise?
[149:24.40]Well...
[149:26.79]Yeah, I'm just looking up.
[149:29.77]Subscribe.
[149:30.37]Somebody said, can you connect my fridge to the Wi-Fi?
[149:32.82]We talked about other fridges that we got in the 80s.
[149:36.14]That'd be cool.
[149:36.76]This fridge has been here for about 10 years.
[149:38.92]There's no display, but can we connect this to the Wi-Fi somehow?
[149:42.33]Yeah, that way they know what's... Someone was telling me, I don't really...
[149:47.93]keep up with a lot of stuff but allegedly they do have printers now that will they can you can be at the store and it'll like text you or whatever or you can look at the app and see the inside of your fridge that way you know what to buy allegedly so maybe we can um it's so weird the future the future is now so yeah maybe we tell them we'll see I'll pause the clock for a minute but
[150:17.91]So typically, so I'm obviously very new to this.
[150:21.21]When he says, I'll be back in a few minutes, what is he doing typically?
[150:25.56]Yeah, good question.
[150:27.00]I have no idea.
[150:30.12]My guess?
[150:30.98]Just for no reason.
[150:33.28]So it could be that he's talking to his manager or someone.
[150:39.57]Okay, are you there?
[150:40.71]And it also could just be for show to make it seem legit.
[150:43.59]Hello?
[150:45.41]Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[150:46.07]Are you there?
[150:47.21]We're here.
[150:47.92]We're here.
[150:49.66]Okay.
[150:50.54]Now, what you need to do is just plug in your printer back.
[150:57.24]Is he back?
[150:58.74]Is he on the line?
[151:00.08]Yeah.
[151:01.07]Yeah, yeah.
[151:01.65]Plug it back.
[151:02.45]Plug it.
[151:03.87]Plug it back in.
[151:06.09]Yeah, plug it back in.
[151:07.29]Okay.
[151:09.23]It's very hard to plug back in.
[151:11.35]Well, it'll be your workout for the month.
[151:15.88]He doesn't like to do stretches.
[151:17.28]He doesn't like to do nothing like that.
[151:21.52]Mark, let me ask you this.
[151:22.52]Do you lift, Mark?
[151:23.78]Do you do workouts, weights, stuff like that?
[151:27.07]Yeah, definitely.
[151:28.63]It's my favorite.
[151:30.31]Oh, it's your favorite.
[151:33.81]The right chord?
[151:34.49]I feel like this is the wrong chord.
[151:38.03]It was just in.
[151:41.90]You just unplugged it.
[151:43.92]What did you do with the cord?
[151:45.18]It's given me resistance.
[151:46.58]I don't know.
[151:48.80]Well, push on it.
[151:50.36]Give it a little nudge.
[151:53.40]How hard should he push?
[151:54.58]How hard should... Uh-oh.
[151:56.76]Are you okay?
[151:58.77]This is smoothly.
[152:00.77]We have to plug it in.
[152:02.19]Okay, smoothly.
[152:02.93]He wants you to do it smoothly.
[152:05.57]I did.
[152:05.93]I did it as smooth as I could.
[152:07.77]Okay.
[152:09.07]Alright.
[152:09.47]Now just hit the power button.
[152:11.67]on the printer uh oh you're gonna have to turn the light switch on sorry this this printer is hooked up to um oh yeah yeah sorry sorry I'm good okay so we're turning the printer on and now what okay now let me know once your printer turns on
[152:41.32]Seems like it's turning on now.
[152:42.92]Yeah, it's making the little noises and stuff that it's supposed to make.
[152:47.38]Okay, perfect, perfect.
[152:49.18]Now, let me know what comes up in the small display on the printer.
[152:58.83]When should we see that?
[152:59.57]Should it happen soon or after a few minutes?
[153:03.61]What should we do?
[153:05.29]When you will turn on the printer from the power button.
[153:17.99]After you plug in the cord, you have to hit the power button.
[153:25.01]The power is on.
[153:27.33]It's very clear.
[153:29.03]Where are we looking?
[153:30.61]What do you see on the display of the printer?
[153:36.36]It's hard to see.
[153:38.04]Do you know what happens when you leave something in the sun for too long?
[153:43.08]It kind of looks like a calculator.
[153:45.00]You ever lift the calculator outside?
[153:46.86]It's a little hard to read it.
[153:49.44]I think it says ready, but I'm not sure.
[153:53.03]Okay.
[153:53.93]So press the menu button.
[153:56.73]The menu button.
[153:57.75]Press the menu button.
[154:01.77]Okay.
[154:02.07]Where's the menu button?
[154:06.72]Mark, where is that?
[154:07.76]There are 2,000 buttons on this thing.
[154:10.62]Yeah.
[154:12.61]Okay.
[154:13.49]There is four buttons.
[154:15.25]I don't know if I've ever had them do this before.
[154:18.31]Just the left-hand side to the numbers.
[154:20.21]I'm going to try to download a manual.
[154:21.09]We have one, two, three numbers.
[154:22.64]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[154:24.82]So just on the left-hand side, we have four arrow keys up, down, left, right.
[154:29.26]And just below that, there is a button which is a menu button.
[154:33.80]Okay, hold on.
[154:34.46]You know what?
[154:34.86]You better go get the manual.
[154:35.48]On the right-hand side of the display.
[154:37.51]You better go get that manual and put it back together because we're going to need it now.
[154:44.90]Are we actually going to need that?
[154:46.38]I think so.
[154:47.32]He's asking us to do things we don't know how to do.
[154:49.77]It's all torn up back there.
[154:51.23]It's torn up.
[154:52.13]There's no way.
[154:53.01]Yeah, this is going to be difficult for us.
[154:55.23]Let me lean it.

[154:59.55]Yeah, Mark, this is going to be a problem for us.

[158:27.62]You have to select the network.
[158:30.20]Yeah, the display is...
[158:32.97]It's, like, very hard to read because of the sun.
[158:35.65]We have it right next to the window.
[158:37.81]Oh, okay.
[158:39.35]Can you put the curtain on the window?
[158:42.70]What?
[158:42.88]You want me to move the printer?
[158:43.92]You want me to pick the printer up and move it?
[158:47.12]No, I'm saying it's been there for too long.
[158:50.44]Can you put a curtain on your window so that you don't see a sun?
[158:56.25]He doesn't understand what we're saying.
[158:57.89]Oh, the curtain.
[158:58.93]Okay.

[159:26.88]and make the room dark.
[159:28.70]Mark, we don't have a curtain.
[159:29.98]I could stand up.
[159:30.90]I could stand up there and put my hands in the air and stand in the way.
[159:33.44]Actually, why don't you do that?
[159:34.70]Get a chair and I will... If I stand up here and I block out the sun, you'll be able to probably breathe.
[159:43.03]Yeah.

[161:10.54]I can do this all day.
[161:11.52]I know.
[161:12.36]But, you know, between you and I, I've been thinking about just buying a new printer.
[161:16.75]Because it's not worth it.
[161:18.85]This printer is very good.
[161:21.29]It's not worth it.
[161:22.19]You know, we need to set up, you know.
[161:24.59]Anyway, okay, so it says copy.
[161:27.23]It says print.
[161:29.73]Oh, network.
[161:33.42]Okay, the fourth option says printer.

[163:14.66]You can't wait five more minutes.
[163:16.22]I'm telling you, this is why you gotta work out.
[163:18.33]The lactic acid is building up in my body.
[163:21.81]I can't stand it forever.
[163:23.11]Did you get what you needed?
[163:24.45]I don't know.
[163:25.21]What do I do under the wall on?
[163:26.79]We're on the wall on.
[163:28.61]Okay.
[163:29.26]Now we have to select the setup wizard.
[163:34.47]Oh, is that like the guy from Harry Potter?
[163:37.07]We've been watching that series with our grandkids.
[163:40.01]They've got... What is it?
[163:42.15]The guy who... The hat.
[163:44.91]The hat that they put on the kids.
[163:46.87]Is that the setup?
[163:48.52]The sorting hat.
[163:49.28]Oh, sorting, not setup.
[163:50.98]I'm sorry.
[163:51.82]Sorting hat.
[163:52.54]Yeah, but it doesn't make any sense in hindsight.
[163:56.32]I apologize.
[163:57.84]Um...
[163:59.26]okay I click uh okay okay I clicked setup was it no one um give me one second I'm following along an official brother go back press the clear button okay go back go back okay I pressed clear now I'm back so hold on hold on
[164:29.61]okay now uh go to the fourth option which is wps uh we don't we don't really like the wps the ups now there we support the usps okay
[164:46.30]No problem.
[164:47.06]Just select the WPS and it will ask for the Wi-Fi password.
[164:50.70]No, I'm saying we don't want to do the WPS.
[164:56.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[164:57.76]You need the Wi-Fi password.
[164:59.66]Oh, is that what WPS stands for?
[165:02.52]No, I don't need it.
[165:03.98]Wait, sir, we don't even have this thing.
[165:06.36]We're not using the Wi-Fi on this.
[165:11.68]some some guy came and set up all my life I have no idea what the password is he set it up and he just said we just connected and never turned it off yeah he told us the password is on the fridge but we've looked on the fridge and never found it so we're not really sure some random guy off craig craigslist but he was a good kid what was his good kid cost a thousand bucks he's a good kid though right yeah well help probably helped him towards quality or whatever
[165:42.22]But yeah, we don't use the Wi-Fi on the printer.
[165:45.36]It's just a quad Okay, so just enter the cord on your computer Have you connected the cord with your computer?
[165:56.41]The cord is hooked up to that other box There's like three or four boxes near the internet That's what I'm talking about.
[166:03.52]Oh, I gotta get the box to know.
[166:05.70]Shall we unplug everything?
[166:08.79]What do they call the thing where they put all the wires in it?
[166:13.26]A sorting hat?
[166:14.96]No, a sorting hat, but for wires.
[166:17.54]Give me two minutes.
[166:18.70]Give me two minutes.
[166:19.68]Give me two minutes, alright?
[166:21.78]Okay.
[166:25.28]I'm trying to think of ways to get him.
[166:26.76]So I don't know if you caught when you were standing on the window.
[166:30.34]I told him I was thinking about just getting a new printer.
[166:34.20]And he was like, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.
[166:36.62]I'm curious if we lean into a certain direction.
[166:42.05]Buy a new printer.
[166:43.31]He'll just like them start making up lies about the computer.
[166:46.71]I'm not really sure.
[166:50.65]Yes.
[166:50.93]Hello?
[166:51.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[166:54.76]Okay.
[166:55.80]Do you just need a break, honey?
[166:58.48]I understand if you need a break, honestly.
[167:00.94]My left butt cheek stopped and I get a little tired myself from sitting here.
[167:05.04]Oh, I was just checking out.
[167:06.88]Forget about the guy that was just standing in front of the window.
[167:10.19]Okay, true.
[167:11.15]Sorry.
[167:11.93]Thank you, honey.
[167:12.63]Thank you.
[167:13.05]You looked good up there.
[167:17.01]Thank you.
[167:19.15]Okay, Mark, what are we looking at?
[167:20.51]What are we doing now?
[167:23.12]Go to the setup wizard.
[167:24.84]I can't remember how to do that.
[167:30.21]Menu.
[167:34.67]Network.
[167:36.35]Look at me, honey.
[167:37.97]I'm a wizard.
[167:40.69]Call me.
[167:41.95]Call me Hermite.
[167:43.69]What's the name?
[167:44.19]Hermino?
[167:47.59]Hermino.
[167:48.07]One second.
[167:49.06]I'm pretty sure it was Hermino.
[167:50.48]Are you doing it from the beginning?
[167:53.37]Herman or something.
[167:54.27]Herman Lee.
[167:57.49]We watched the movie yesterday.
[168:00.79]Well, I dozed off.
[168:04.71]And that's what you do.
[168:05.33]You doze off during every movie.
[168:07.12]And you wake up halfway through and you say, who's that person?
[168:09.88]Well, why don't you just stay awake and watch the movie?
[168:11.86]I'm going to tell you what the character is.
[168:14.08]You don't want to talk.
[168:16.44]Watching the sports ball on Sundays.
[168:21.21]Okay, if I doze off during football, I can wake up halfway through and see the score.
[168:25.78]I don't need to ask you who the character is.
[168:27.96]I just need the score.
[168:29.72]Oh, true.
[168:30.32]I never... Okay, I'll be back in one minute, okay?
[168:34.68]Okay, it says Wallon set up wizard.
[168:37.40]Wallon set up wizard.
[168:40.94]Okay.
[168:41.38]Oh, don't take a nap on us now, Ma.
[168:44.58]I'm just kidding.
[168:46.20]You need to select Wallon.
[168:48.24]You need to select Wallon.
[168:51.20]okay I selected okay now set up yeah number two option is set up wizard select that a wizard so click ok okay no I can't can you just show can you tell us a shortcut how to get here again in case I don't want to be you know rude but would you be a doll mark and just tell us how do we get here
[169:17.55]Can you make it so if I click one of these buttons, I get back to this spot every time?
[169:21.47]Like an app?
[169:23.21]Like how you put Facebook on your iPad?
[169:25.53]Can you put like a setup wizard?
[169:29.58]Again with the wizard.
[169:31.38]Actually, we can only do it through a printer.
[169:34.18]So just select setup wizard.
[169:36.60]Okay, on setup wizard.
[169:38.74]Okay, on setup wizard.
[169:42.18]Alright, now it says searching.
[169:45.40]Now select your internet.
[169:46.77]Searching SSID.
[169:50.93]Okay, just wait.
[169:58.97]Mark, how much is one of these printers?
[170:00.79]I don't remember what we paid for this.
[170:03.53]I'm sorry?
[170:05.04]How much does one of these printers cost?
[170:07.46]I don't even remember.
[170:10.36]Let me tell you.
[170:11.36]Give me one second.
[170:12.56]Yeah, it's just searching.
[170:16.98]Okay, okay, now it says select SSID and set.
[170:20.68]And underneath that it says NSA surveillance van.
[170:33.13]Oh, is he gone?
[170:35.91]Okay, are you there?
[170:38.81]Yeah, it looks like it's... If I hit the different arrows, it's got like NSA surveillance, drop it like it's hotspot, New England clam router.
[170:51.76]It's just got a bunch of different names.
[170:53.26]Okay.
[170:54.20]I don't know what these are.
[170:55.14]You have to select your internet services there.
[171:00.72]I don't know.
[171:01.08]Oh, there's one said, tell my Wi-Fi I love her.
[171:09.77]Go-go router ranges.
[171:11.38]I don't know what these are.
[171:12.92]I don't know what any of these are.
[171:15.10]We didn't do this.
[171:16.90]Yeah, sorry.
[171:21.00]You know what I'm thinking, Mark?
[171:23.81]Can you just sell us another printer?
[171:26.69]How much is a new printer?
[171:28.91]What if we pack this up in a box?
[171:30.49]We still got the original box somewhere.
[171:32.37]We keep all of our boxes.
[171:34.38]Um, we pick it up in there, put the quad in there, put the manual, albeit shredded, we'll put it... Maybe we could tape it back up?
[171:42.67]What do you think, honey?
[171:43.77]Tape the manual back up?
[171:44.71]Oh, I think we shipped the thing to Antarctica.
[171:47.91]Oh, just get rid of it.
[171:49.15]Yeah, what if we send this thing out of orbit?
[171:51.88]Um, put it... Maybe we'll throw it in the garbage, but... Mark, I would shoot this out of a cannon if I could.
[171:57.14]Like Gonzo from the Muppets.
[171:59.84]um that's okay uh let me let me show you a video okay how this person is doing it no let me show you a video we've been on the phone with you for what 20 minutes at least half an hour it's been at least 15 minutes maybe 15. um and my husband spent all night all day on this and it's not I don't want to we don't want to waste your time you know
[172:25.52]What would it take to get us a brand new model?
[172:32.32]Put on your sales cap for a minute.
[172:34.38]What would it take to give us a brand new model printer?
[172:37.75]Yeah, a brand new one.
[172:39.10]But still, you have to set up it, right?
[172:41.96]Then again, the same problem will be there till the time you don't set up it.
[172:45.89]We can get that kid from Craigslist again.
[172:48.47]Yeah, yeah.
[172:48.81]It was set up fine before until we clicked that email, I think.
[172:54.20]So, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[172:59.50]We can get a kid to come over and set it up.
[173:01.72]How much is our new printer?
[173:05.02]uh it will cost you like uh 250 or 200 dollars around that okay that's not okay can you see this video can you see this video for just few seconds so maybe you can understand can I tell you this is the process we are in can I tell you something uh we don't use we don't use the wifi in our house
[173:34.32]I understand.
[173:40.91]It's Wi-Fi, by the way.
[173:42.79]You're saying it wrong.
[173:43.55]You say it wrong every day.
[173:45.62]Wi-Fi.
[173:46.20]Sorry, we don't use the Wi-Fi.
[173:49.56]Okay, okay.
[173:50.88]It stands for wireless frequency.
[173:52.94]Then you have to give me two minutes of your previous time, okay?
[173:58.48]Just allow me two minutes so that I can check out with my engineer, okay?
[174:02.22]Yeah, is there any way that you could just check to make sure that there's not... Because I'm telling you, the thing was working yesterday.
[174:09.15]I don't... Everything's still plugged in.
[174:13.37]It might have been that email.
[174:14.59]I don't know.
[174:17.15]If you tell... Yeah, you talk to your engineer.
[174:22.12]Okay, just give me two minutes.
[174:23.76]Let me talk to him.
[174:26.63]printer engineer yeah he so he might be going away to text his well or like whatever snapchat whatsapp I don't know message his like boss I will say this is some of the most he seems to be genuinely kind of trying to do something a lot of times right now
[174:48.98]yeah by now a lot of times they've like lied to me I know that they're not brother for sure so it doesn't at the end of the day I know we're talking to some sketchy like they're gonna do something and I'm actually a friend of mine um his mother had called to do something like this to get her like fax or printer working
[175:11.59]And they did, they installed some sort of driver and her printer worked.
[175:16.95]And then they called her back a week later and told her that there were like virus infections and stuff.
[175:22.12]So sometimes it's the long con.
[175:25.44]So this could be the ultra long con.
[175:27.78]Yeah, I don't know.
[175:29.96]All I know for sure is that this is not Brother and that they are one way or another trying to take advantage of our, we believe that it is, Brother printer.
[175:44.07]You're saying it wrong.
[175:44.88]You say it wrong every day.
[175:46.32]I was going to use a quick bathroom break.
[175:50.26]I'll come back if you're still on with him.
[175:54.82]I'll try him back in.
[175:59.43]I have to drop the printer.
[176:04.41]Yeah, just make a bunch of like crashing noises.
[176:10.05]Just like...
[176:14.37]Hey, listen, leave the guy alone.
[176:24.40]Your password is still on the fridge.
[176:26.20]Yeah, I heard that joke once before.
[176:30.28]You tell people when they come to your house, what's the Wi-Fi password?
[176:36.27]You say, on the fridge.
[176:37.91]And then they go, look, on the fridge.
[176:39.61]But the password is on the fridge.
[176:42.60]yeah yeah I thought that was I thought that was clever uh flip nor thank you guys thank you for the subs and resubs and stuff I hope you're having a blast I'm it is I'm having a very fun time just uh creating this weird couple
[177:03.01]that needs their printer fixed.
[177:05.47]It's a pleasure.
[177:06.18]I hope you guys are having some fun.
[177:08.10]Um, I guess so far, maybe at some point along the way, I will, we'll call someone else depending on where it goes with this guy.
[177:17.97]But, um, it, yeah, he hasn't done anything
[177:25.07]like overwhelmingly scammy yet but yeah it's not actual brother printer I wouldn't be calling the actual you there brother printer support hello you there yeah you there I'm here I'm here okay
[177:45.01]What I'm trying to say is that as you guys are continuously being busy to get this printer fixed properly, so I can understand you guys might be too much stressed out.
[177:59.51]So what I have got to know from my engineer, the brother engineer, the brother printer engineer,
[178:06.53]He wants to go ahead and check out some details, and he needs to keep your case under observation for at least 24 hours, okay?
[178:16.52]so if you don't mind can we make a call tomorrow to you so that you will be freshed up do not spend more time today on the sprinter just be relaxed tomorrow I will give you a call and we'll relaxly fix the problem would that be fine wait wait wait is there any way what's going on hey um he's telling us that they have to put up an observation right now observation actually he needs to go ahead
[178:44.98]Did the printer's appendix explode?
[178:48.90]No, no, no.
[178:49.86]What if we do this?
[178:50.84]Is there any way to do like a quick, like maybe wait an hour, wait 20 minutes or something like that?
[178:57.68]Is it sick, do you think?
[178:59.16]Do you think it's sick?
[179:00.74]Let me write it down on the notepad, okay?
[179:03.74]Okay.
[179:06.73]yeah this might be the like long con or he might be one of the only guys in the office right now and so he's just trying to keep it going since you're not using wi-fi my engineer wants to keep it under observation huh what can we do um what can we do to fix it right now or do we just get a new printer you think
[179:36.63]We get a new printer or we get an observation?
[179:39.38]Yeah, I don't want to put a printer under observation.
[179:41.78]How much does that cost to put a printer under observation?
[179:44.52]We don't have insurance for this kind of thing.
[179:46.28]No, there is no cost.
[179:47.88]There is no cost.
[179:49.44]Yeah, I can't imagine.
[179:50.41]I mean, it's pretty pricey to put someone under observation for 24 hours in a hospital.
[179:55.10]No, no, no.
[179:56.60]He will not keep your printer in the observation.
[179:59.72]He will keep your details of the printer.
[180:01.78]Mark, between us, listen, we're a little bit older.
[180:04.88]If you need to just tell us bluntly.
[180:07.12]Do we need to take this thing outside behind the barn and drop it off at Uncle's farmhouse?
[180:13.01]What do we... I will elbow drop this off of the shed if you tell me to, Mark.
[180:18.71]Not at all.
[180:19.27]I will do a Hulk Hogan leg drop to this thing off the shed.
[180:24.00]You couldn't even stand and cover the window for five minutes.
[180:27.24]You're going to jump off the shed?
[180:30.55]Okay.
[180:31.09]I'm saying just wait till tomorrow because as you guys are already...
[180:38.58]Honey, we got all after... You don't understand.
[180:41.10]Our kids are coming over tomorrow.
[180:42.76]It's their birthday.
[180:43.71]We're trying to print them a birthday card.
[180:46.71]We probably didn't tell you that.
[180:49.17]If we just gotta go over... If we just gotta order from Best Buy or something, if we just gotta have them... I think they do curbside pickup right now.
[181:00.72]Can you imagine not spending a dollar on a birthday card?
[181:05.74]There is no problem with the printer, okay?
[181:08.86]It's just the principle of the thing.
[181:12.26]$6 for a birthday card?
[181:16.07]I would rather spend $250, $300 on a printer and print my own.
[181:20.75]That's how many birthday cards, honey?
[181:23.53]That's the kind of logic that I'm working with.
[181:27.83]There's hundreds of birthday cards we can print.
[181:29.63]Can you see what I'm writing down over there?
[181:31.60]It's that we need to set up the printer.
[181:37.38]We already set it up, though.
[181:38.42]It just doesn't work.
[181:40.22]It stopped working.
[181:42.08]Yeah, it'll do.
[181:43.22]No, it's not set up properly.
[181:50.11]Yes, it is.
[181:51.15]Yes, it is.
[181:53.27]Didn't you print something from this the other day?
[181:55.59]Yeah, literally like two days ago.
[181:59.33]It's... There's a deep... I think there could be... I think there could be a deeper problem.
[182:06.22]That's what I'm concerned about.
[182:09.58]Okay, just wait.
[182:10.64]Just wait, okay?
[182:13.05]Is there something... You were talking about observation, doctor.
[182:16.22]Is there something that you can do a little bit more immediate, like a... What do they call that scan where it scans your whole body?
[182:25.38]Like you put the printer inside.
[182:26.74]Can you put the printer inside?
[182:27.81]An MRI?
[182:28.57]An MRI.
[182:29.27]Can you do like a print MRI?
[182:33.89]No, no, no.
[182:36.19]Just wait, okay?
[182:39.68]Okay.
[182:44.04]He just wants to blackmail and have someone else work with him.
[182:46.96]I am dying over here, man.
[182:48.18]I keep having to mute.
[182:50.50]Just do one thing.
[182:52.76]Can you guys do one thing?
[182:55.55]Just have a glass of water for yourself, please.
[182:59.99]Okay.
[183:00.53]That actually sounds good.
[183:01.99]Maybe we'll get up and stretch.
[183:04.01]We'll be back.
[183:09.50]Maybe we could...
[183:12.41]I think he's getting bothered.
[183:14.77]At one point when we were talking about the CAT scan or whatever, he was like, oh, God.
[183:18.55]He said something.
[183:21.98]What was I going to say?
[183:24.80]Spill the water, people.
[183:28.16]I could probably get some sounds to make it.
[183:31.60]Spill it on me and like on the printer.
[183:36.32]That is how you did it.
[183:37.74]You did it.
[183:38.46]You spilled it on the printer.
[183:39.83]Yes, spilled it.
[183:42.18]why isn't he trying to scare well I don't know it seems like they're trying to be pretty um what would the word be legit like they're trying to be oh is he gonna try to help us buy a printer wait he's gonna help us buy a printer wait what is happening right now admittedly I've never experienced this before um
[184:11.38]We're just going to buy a printer.
[184:14.33]What is he going to do?
[184:17.09]Tell us to... Let me just... I'm going to Google their phone number really quick, but... Oh, yeah.
[184:26.22]So I'm looking through my records.
[184:28.26]Yeah, this is actual brother... No, I'm just kidding.
[184:33.04]They have...
[184:35.63]They own a website that's something like, this isn't exactly it, but it's something to the effect of officialbrotherprinter.support.
[184:46.00]And then they make the website try to look like the actual Brother Printer website.
[184:54.04]and they plaster their phone number all over it so they're trying really hard to like trick someone into believing that their printer or that their their brother so that it might just be they're trying to earn our trust there's also um people have said in the past that um yeah he's trying to find drivers
[185:16.90]people have said in the past that scammers often like sometimes they would sell this as a good lead and then the refund scammers call you back a week or two later and say hey remember when remember when you paid for that like service on your computer
[185:32.82]with your printer, it turns out that company's not around anymore and we've got to give you a refund or something like that.
[185:43.38]But they're going about this in a seemingly professional... What if we went to... I mean, one way to just call him out sort of and to see what he does is we could go to brother.com and it'll have a phone number and I could be like, oh, let's call...
[186:01.50]Well, let's call someone else up and see if, you know, someone else.
[186:06.80]We can get a couple people helping us on the phone.
[186:09.02]Oh, what does he do?
[186:09.72]I think he's, let's see if he goes to like a fake website.
[186:15.48]Brother Printer USA?
[186:17.54]I don't know.
[186:18.06]I'm curious what he's going to do.
[186:26.66]Oh, this looks like it might actually be Brother.
[186:29.75]Double check.
[186:35.50]Sometimes I hide the screen in case it's Oh, yeah, it is brother.
[186:41.33]It is brother USA, I think.
[186:46.91]Because someone else owned brother sucks for them.
[186:55.41]But yeah, we could try to like, just sort of put a little bit of fire under him, so to speak and
[187:03.29]we're gonna go somewhere else maybe maybe we could like oh maybe we'll call the official maybe we'll call brother and then and see how much a print maybe we can buy one a printer off of them or something maybe we'll just or yeah I'll just like click contact us and see I'll come back to the phone uh hey I'm back by the way you know what I was thinking um give me just a
[187:35.70]I'm realizing now, I don't know if this is the place I was at before when I was getting the number or not.
[187:42.61]But let me see.
[187:44.13]What if we call someone else and see if they have any other... Like, we could get a couple people on the line and see.
[187:52.51]No, I'm trying to fix it up, okay?
[187:54.55]Don't worry.
[187:55.23]Oh, you're trying... Okay, you're just trying to do it right now.
[187:58.31]Yeah, stay on the line.
[187:59.31]Stay on the line.
[188:00.37]Okay, how long do you think it's going to take?
[188:03.42]Can you give me...
[188:05.79]An estimate?
[188:06.39]Thank you.
[188:12.92]Yeah, I forgot.
[188:13.44]I totally forgot.
[188:33.49]Move this out of the way here.
[188:35.83]Kind of in the way.
[188:37.79]There we go.
[188:44.46]Spill joke.
[188:49.00]Maybe.
[188:50.76]I mean, that's going nuclear.
[188:52.23]You know what I mean?
[188:53.19]If we spill the water all over the printer.
[188:55.27]We'll have to decide, because at some point, if the guy's... I don't know what the word is.
[189:00.45]If he's just going to keep
[189:02.87]going the way he's going we at some point may want to get him to yeah come clean and be like okay I'm not actually right I'm not actually you want me to kind of come in and like you're trying to call it out okay oh yeah yeah maybe um let me I'm gonna send you I'll show everybody taking a screenshot so they actually have you a youtube channel
[189:32.92]And that a similar video that he was just sharing with us um they They post like setup videos, oh, okay.
[189:45.31]Yeah, well, yeah, sorry, we're doing a crass web puzzle Okay Pass it some time, you know, yep
[189:58.56]Is everything okay?
[190:00.16]I think your phone is starting to print.
[190:01.64]Is that the Wi-Fi print?
[190:03.58]It's making some weird noises.
[190:05.38]No, I'm... Oh, God, can you hear anything?
[190:09.04]I'm trying to install the printer.
[190:17.63]Okay, I turned RTX voice on.
[190:19.55]It's cutting out so much.
[190:21.31]Give me time.
[190:24.57]Yeah, why don't you try to, like... You know what?
[190:26.05]I'm gonna...
[190:27.18]Let me see if I can find their phone number like how easy it is to or I can I can even just walk in and be like, I'm on the phone with with I'm called I'm about to I'm gonna call the brother support line with me if we could do double or you could call it.
[190:40.70]I'll get somebody.
[190:42.22]That's fine.
[190:43.66]We'll see what he says.
[190:54.50]Yeah, I think.
[190:55.01]Yep.
[190:58.23]I'm calling the support number so we can do two at the same time.
[191:02.36]Oh, you think that could be a good idea, actually?
[191:05.12]You can work with Mark, and I'll call Brother over here, and I'll talk over here.
[191:09.57]Maybe get two people going at the same time.
[191:11.87]We are from the Brother support.
[191:15.06]You don't think that having two people at the same time, I mean, you could talk to her and I could go in the other room, because I'll tell you.
[191:22.55]I mean, getting a little... That's a five-head idea right there.
[191:26.59]500 IQ.
[191:33.33]Anyways, the thing which I'm trying to work here, it's working good, so I don't think so that you guys have to bother yourself.
[191:43.12]Well, no, it's just the timing of it, you know, with our grandkid, with Michael coming, it's his birthday.
[191:50.92]Tomorrow.
[191:55.60]Or is it today?
[191:56.24]Is it birthday today or tomorrow?
[191:58.54]Oh, it's tomorrow.
[191:59.50]Okay, good.
[192:03.62]I thought so.
[192:05.43]I'll call them on the other line.
[192:08.23]I'll go in the other room and I'll call brother on the other line and you can talk to brother here.
[192:15.39]Yeah, why don't we do that?
[192:16.81]Yeah, okay.
[192:18.33]I'll keep I'll stay on though.
[192:20.03]Are you fine with that mark?
[192:20.97]And if we need to, we can probably merge the calls or do some kind of speakerphone thing.
[192:28.80]But wait, are you looking up how to install a parent?
[192:32.98]Have you ever installed a printer before mark?
[192:38.11]Or are you kind of new?
[192:39.13]Actually, you know, the driver... Are you kind of new to this whole thing?
[192:41.38]The driver is missing from your computer.
[192:44.00]That's why the thing is not working.
[192:47.90]Oh, okay.
[192:50.93]So I'm just trying to install the drivers.
[192:53.17]Just bear with me.
[192:55.65]Okay.
[192:58.63]I mean, he's like... Sort of, right?
[193:02.26]Well...
[193:03.51]I mean, it says that I have the printer installed, but he's... He solved it.
[193:07.81]He's sort of trying to solve it.
[193:09.25]Yeah, I mean...
[193:14.35]it's crazy he's saying that so a lot of times these guys will say they won't directly say that their brothers support either they'll say something like we provide support for printers which is what he said in the beginning um they try to skirt around it and say well we're actually a third party technician we're actually we don't know what if we say the printer works oh yeah I could just play sounds and be like oh look it's it's working like that oh yeah what if it just works
[193:42.49]Yeah, let me find a sound really quick.
[193:44.25]I think I have one of just a printer.
[193:47.91]Yeah.
[193:50.30]Yeah, I guess we could do that and then see if he is like, well, actually, blah, blah, blah.
[193:57.60]Get us to work and then spill water.
[194:01.34]That's then it's our fault.
[194:02.58]It's our problem.
[194:06.03]And see what he does.
[194:07.07]Yeah, yeah.
[194:11.74]I don't know if I have any sounds for like a... Oh, we could just spill water on it and then... Okay, let me see this.
[194:23.89]So he doesn't hear this yet.
[194:25.49]You and chat should hear.
[194:26.83]Oh, that sounds like a printer.
[194:34.75]Right?
[194:36.43]Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
[194:38.55]Okay.
[194:40.58]Well, I'll just... Yeah, why don't you be like, oh, the other guy... Sorry.
[194:48.12]The other guy... The actual brother support.
[194:50.80]Barging and be like, oh, the other guy told me to do X, Y, Z. It's actually printing.
[194:56.07]Come over here.
[194:57.03]Like, I don't know.
[194:59.89]This is ridiculous.
[195:00.83]Okay.

[195:49.78]Why?
[195:50.44]What did you do?
[195:51.10]I talked to somebody.

[196:41.01]What happened?
[196:41.43]I talked to somebody on the phone, and they told me to put this thing on, I had to plug it in, plug it back in, and I pressed one button.
[196:48.41]You pressed one button?
[196:49.55]Oh, thank God.
[196:51.55]Well, Mark, I think that other guy, I think we got it working.
[196:56.64]Thank God.
[196:57.68]Actually, I have installed the driver.
[197:00.00]That's why it's working.
[197:01.54]The driver was not installed.
[197:04.67]Oh.
[197:07.95]Uh... I mean, it's driving now.
[197:10.81]It was... I don't understand.

[197:17.53]Watch out for your... Is it the Pepsi?
[197:19.01]Is it... No!
[197:22.31]And that's how you ruin everything.
[197:23.53]That's how you ruin everything.
[197:24.37]It's everywhere right now.
[197:26.04]Let me go get some towels.
[197:27.12]Let me go get some towels.
[197:28.94]Get inside.
[197:29.56]Just get a towel quick, quick, quick.

[197:35.51]Oh, unbelievable.
[197:38.70]Absolutely unbelievable.
[197:41.12]Get this one in the laundry room.
[197:43.20]Go up there and get a towel.

[198:19.71]Oh, don't you tell him I did it.
[198:20.91]Don't you tell him.
[198:21.69]I reached over your shoulder and you knocked it out of my hand.
[198:25.41]Hold on.
[198:25.83]It spilled all over the desk.
[198:28.58]Hold on.

[199:00.65]You're gonna have to lift the printer for me.
[199:02.18]I can't.
[199:03.16]I can't lift the printer for you.
[199:05.36]Okay, you ready?
[199:06.10]Take it underneath it.

[199:16.48]Alright, it's this thing.
[199:17.49]It's like 200 pounds.
[199:19.11]Lift it up higher.
[199:19.87]I can't get my arm under this.
[199:21.33]Oh, lift it up higher.
[199:22.17]Okay, here you go.
[199:25.37]Okay, okay.

[199:33.47]Yep, yep.
[199:38.99]Every day.
[199:43.96]Ask Mark if I should get rice.
[199:46.00]You know how you're supposed to put rice on electronics to get what?
[199:52.50]Mark, are you still there?
[199:55.06]Yeah, I'm here.
[199:56.26]I'm here.
[199:57.38]What should we do if we put water on the computer parts like a printer?
[200:04.18]You spill some water on the printer?
[200:07.77]Well, that's debatable on who.
[200:11.03]But let's just say a little bit.
[200:12.73]Let's just say some got in there.
[200:14.51]Okay.
[200:16.15]No problem.
[200:16.95]Just plug it off for at least five to seven minutes.
[200:21.63]Just unplug it?
[200:24.55]Yeah, for five to seven minutes.
[200:28.54]Okay, let me... Hey, honey, I'm Nick.
[200:31.36]I don't know if there's any other towels right now.
[200:34.20]I don't think there's... We don't have any towels?
[200:37.44]No, we're going to have to do... We have to do the laundry.
[200:41.18]He told... Hey, look.
[200:42.81]He said we have to keep it unplugged for 57 minutes to five... What was it?
[200:47.59]You dropped the applesauce the other day and we used all of them.
[200:51.81]When it broke there in the kitchen...
[200:54.78]Mark, do printers work okay if you spill, what was it, 30, 37, 72 ounces?
[201:00.87]He told me to unplug it and keep it unplugged for five to seven minutes.
[201:06.82]Oh, okay.
[201:10.46]Mark, what happens if we plug this back in?
[201:11.84]What if it don't work?
[201:14.98]No, it will work.
[201:15.86]Don't worry.
[201:18.01]Almost 32 ounces of liquid.
[201:18.75]Drop off.
[201:21.49]Just wipe out the drops of water from the printer.
[201:24.64]Okay, give us a minute.
[201:25.60]I do have a 50-pound bag of rice I could pour over, too, if we need to put it in the bathtub or something.
[201:31.71]But hold on.
[201:35.65]I don't think the bathtub is big enough.
[201:38.19]I'm eating this, sorry.
[201:39.70]Did anybody catch that...
[201:42.16]so he never installed the printer driver I I closed out of the printer driver and he's like I I did it I was the one who fixed it it was me I fixed the printer
[201:53.58]So you cancelled the driver install?
[201:57.42]Yeah.
[201:57.84]But he was like really excitedly like, I did it.
[202:01.20]It was me.
[202:01.72]I fixed the printer.
[202:04.28]32 ounces of liquid.
[202:04.92]There's no way this printer ever turns on again.
[202:07.98]If you dump a... That's a full Gatorade bottle.
[202:11.20]This thing is never turning on again.
[202:12.70]Jeez.
[202:14.82]Well, five minutes.
[202:18.74]I'm not even sure what to...
[202:20.81]to say to this guy like what way do you go from here the printer is toast oh we could ask for printer insurance someone from chat said yeah I'll tell I'll come in and be like the fridge is really starting to stink
[202:45.70]well I I unplugged it but like an hour or two ago when he told me to unplug everything sometimes when we're um when this stuff is happening I just imagine how much fun it would be to like
[203:00.72]Don't take this the wrong way but like physically be in Like a house with you and just have like actual printers and fridges and this I don't know how to explain I just imagine us like literally smashing printers and stuff.
[203:15.42]Oh, yeah.
[203:15.96]No for sure Okay, um me Yeah, he's still patiently on the phone Yeah, literally smashing.
[203:26.05]I just said
[203:27.58]literally smashing in a house with you on the internet at the same time in front of thousands of people I wonder I wonder what he's going to say when if if it's if he said oh it's going to work just give it a few minutes what if it doesn't like what's he going to say oh well don't worry it will like that's crazy yeah I guess we can do it I guess we can kind of like alright what are we gonna what are we gonna do here what are we gonna do here yeah see what he
[204:02.10]Alright, Mark, you're still there?
[204:05.33]There's kind of a weird smell coming from the kitchen, by the way.
[204:10.17]But what are we supposed to be doing here?
[204:16.07]Okay, so we have to wipe each and every drop of water from the printer.
[204:22.21]Once it is all dried, then we have to plug the printer back in.
[204:28.11]How are we going to do that?
[204:29.45]He poured an entire gallon of water.
[204:32.64]There's water sloshing all over the place.
[204:34.90]He picked it up and the paper is all soaking wet.
[204:38.58]It's got a soggy bottom, as Mary Berry would say.
[204:42.84]Do you have a dryer or something?
[204:47.85]Hair dryer?
[204:49.87]No, I don't do hair dryers.
[204:52.41]You want me to put it in the dryer?
[204:55.76]Oh, is that okay?
[204:56.84]No, we have to just use the dryer to make the water dry.
[205:00.06]That's it.
[205:00.72]You're talking about like a washer and dryer where you just put it in the dryer on like a light spin cycle?
[205:05.37]Oh, you don't need to wash your printer now.
[205:08.36]No, not wash it, dry it in the dryer.
[205:11.95]Oh, yeah, we have to, yeah, just dry, that's it.
[205:14.63]Oh, what about the oven?
[205:15.57]If we put it on the oven at like, what, like 150, will that... No, you do not need to put it in an oven, no, no, not at all.
[205:22.17]Oh, that's, that's, that's, no, no, that dry heat, not liquid heat.
[205:28.40]Uh... Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[205:30.76]A dry heat, not the liquid heat, that's correct.
[205:34.23]What about a, what about an oven is liquid heat?
[205:39.92]No, we can't put the printer in an oven.
[205:43.40]I'm not saying that... I don't want to put it on the highest setting there.
[205:49.63]I want it to be a very low... You're going to make printer cookies?
[205:57.35]No, I'm not making printer cookies.
[205:59.43]I'm not putting it on broil.
[206:01.01]Just turn it on.
[206:02.75]Just turn on the fan in the room and just wait, okay?
[206:07.77]It's already been five minutes.
[206:09.19]Just turn it on.
[206:09.87]Just see if it works.
[206:10.95]I don't have time for this.
[206:12.33]You want me to plug?
[206:13.67]I'm not plugging this in.
[206:17.87]At least pour the water out.
[206:19.93]Can you at least pour the water out of it?
[206:21.71]Like if we just lift it up and pour it into the trash can.
[206:25.58]Let me ask you this, Mark.
[206:27.36]Is there any kind of warranty or like printer insurance?
[206:34.27]uh that depends you might have got a paper uh the warranty paper when you bought this printer and it it should be mentioned there has been probably one of the covers under the warranty I ripped it up I ripped it up yeah a shot of rage one day trying to fix it I just rip up papers mark mark what are we supposed to what are we supposed to do here so did you you're saying you
[207:04.09]Just saying you fixed it.
[207:05.43]Is it just unfortunate timing?
[207:07.09]Is it like God doesn't want us to have this printer anymore?
[207:11.76]I mean, what's happening?
[207:13.80]I have installed the driver.
[207:15.60]It's all working good, but we just need to wait.
[207:26.05]What are we waiting for?
[207:27.27]What are we waiting for, Mark?
[207:33.55]Yeah, I'm saying we are just waiting for it to get dried properly, okay?
[207:41.13]Otherwise, you know, it will be very dangerous if there is any water inside it.
[207:47.75]So just wait, okay?
[207:49.41]Okay, should we turn the... Should we just turn everything in the room off?
[207:53.33]Like the computer and everything?
[207:54.48]Oh, what if we hang it... No, no.
[207:57.66]What about air drying it, like outside?
[207:59.42]We can hang it outside.
[208:01.20]We can hang it outside with a clothes hanger.
[208:03.87]A couple clothespins.
[208:07.11]Just turn on the fan.
[208:12.06]Just turn on the fan in the room and that's it.
[208:14.80]I don't have a fan in this room.
[208:16.04]Why would we have a fan in the computer room?
[208:19.28]We got a fan in the family room.
[208:21.64]We could bring it into the family room and then turn that on.
[208:23.66]But that's a big room.
[208:24.44]I don't know if that would drive that.
[208:25.48]It's sitting in the sun right now.
[208:26.30]The problem with this, honey, the problem is if we leave, let's say we leave it sitting overnight for the next couple of days, it's just going to be a Pepsi-ridden printer.
[208:39.32]Why don't you put it in the fridge?
[208:44.33]Oh, would that help it cool down?
[208:46.81]Wait, what does that do?
[208:48.69]I would assume.
[208:49.81]Oh, then that way the Pepsi doesn't, you know, spoil.
[208:52.49]Do one thing.
[208:53.98]Do one thing.
[208:55.52]Do one thing.
[208:57.30]Leave the printer as it is for 30 minutes, and I'm going to give you guys a call, okay?
[209:03.64]Do not turn on before 30 minutes, okay?
[209:06.27]Just wait for 30 minutes.
[209:07.93]That's a long time.
[209:08.69]Let the water get dried up, and then we'll work on it, okay?
[209:17.37]I don't know.
[209:17.97]What do you think, Hunt?
[209:19.17]It'll be five to seven.
[209:22.55]Look, Mark, I ain't a scientist, but I think it's going to take a few days for this to dry out.
[209:28.90]Just to be clear, Mark, there is water dripping currently.
[209:35.98]from the printer right now I'm looking over oh yeah so I was not I was not aware that how much water quantity there's about a gallon about a gallon of water I would say about my husband my husband was drinking a lot of Pepsi I try to be on a schedule where I I drink it and I urinate every every hour on the hour like clockwork do one thing
[210:04.45]Just wait for 30 minutes because right now... Let me ask you something.
[210:08.70]How much...
[210:13.12]How much would it cost us right here, right now?
[210:16.49]If you got to transfer us to the sales department, that's fine with me.
[210:20.47]How much would it cost us to buy a new printer, overnight ship it, and give us a warranty against unforeseen floods?
[210:31.02]Call it Noah's Ark insurance or something.
[210:34.00]I don't know.
[210:38.54]It's the COVID-19 period, so the overnight shipping will be a little difficult.
[210:43.50]Did you ever unplug the printer?
[210:45.08]Did you ever unplug it?
[210:46.02]It's smelling funny.
[210:47.22]I smell something.
[210:48.86]Like electric, like smoke.
[210:51.10]Oh, no.
[210:51.67]It's unplugged.
[210:52.15]What are you talking about?
[210:55.03]Okay, hopefully... I do smell something, though.
[210:57.69]What am I smelling?
[210:58.59]I don't know what that is.
[211:00.67]You know, I smelled it.
[211:01.63]It smells like rotten eggs.
[211:02.83]I smelled it when I was in the kitchen earlier.
[211:05.00]I don't...
[211:07.75]I unplugged the fridge, though.
[211:10.05]Why did you unplug?
[211:11.22]You guys can... You unplugged the fridge?
[211:14.52]Just listen.
[211:17.02]Hello?
[211:18.50]Why did you unplug the fridge?
[211:20.52]I unplugged the fridge.
[211:21.50]Mark told me to unplug everything, so I unplugged the fridge, too.
[211:24.03]I thought he was going to be a fridge guy and help us later.
[211:26.99]You just walked around the house unplugging everything?
[211:30.83]He said he was going to fix the fridge.
[211:32.25]Did you unplug the fish tank?
[211:35.72]No, of course not.
[211:36.62]You think I would put Jerry in jeopardy?
[211:40.22]But you're unplugging our fridge.
[211:41.76]Mark, let me ask you something, Mark.
[211:44.15]Can you fix the fridge, Mark?
[211:46.03]Can you fix the fridge?
[211:46.91]Because my husband's over here thinking you're going to fix everything in our house.
[211:51.99]No, we don't fix the fridge.
[211:54.01]Why are you getting these ideas?
[211:56.94]I did I I thought he said he was that he could fix the fridge but I thought the defroster was something was wrong with it to unplug the printer not the fridge god help us okay listen mark how much how much does it cost right now for an opener okay give me some time can I give you guys a call after some time can you just transfer us to the sales department please
[212:22.61]Yeah.
[212:23.09]So let me go ahead and get you guys a call arranged in next 15 to 20 minutes from the sales team.
[212:29.17]We'll stay on hold.
[212:30.13]Just transfer us to the sales team.
[212:31.57]That's fine.
[212:33.91]Okay.
[212:34.27]So just wait for 15 minutes because the call long, the poll queue is very long.
[212:39.18]So just wait for 15 minutes.
[212:40.48]Alright.
[212:41.00]Can you do me a favor?
[212:41.72]Can you give us the... Poll queue is long?
[212:45.02]What did you say?
[212:46.88]What is a poll queue?
[212:48.66]It's a poll queue.
[212:51.30]No, the long queue.
[212:53.28]It's a long queue of customers for the calls.
[212:56.63]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[212:57.69]Alright.
[213:00.57]So just wait and give me 10 or 15 minutes, alright?
[213:07.17]Okay.
[213:08.37]Let me connect your call to the sales team, alright?
[213:12.06]Okay, thank you.
[213:15.18]Are you alright there?
[213:17.30]Are you okay?
[213:17.88]It's not that.
[213:20.26]You seem a little choked up.
[213:21.36]Is everything alright?
[213:30.23]Oh, yeah.
[213:33.87]Jerma, I... I don't know how to process all of this.
[213:39.79]Is he going to call the sales team?
[213:41.53]Are you going to get a call from the sales team now?
[213:44.10]I don't know.
[213:45.28]I've never... I've never had this...
[213:50.69]happen quite this way, but I'm very invested in figuring out what happens.
[213:59.16]Yeah, I don't know.
[214:00.22]I wish I could give you more.
[214:01.38]This is not how the calls normally go for me.
[214:04.10]They normally like at this point, the guy would have said,
[214:09.39]You know what?
[214:09.87]Honestly, guys, your computer, your network is infected.
[214:13.58]It's infected with a virus.
[214:14.58]It's going to cost $500 to fix it.
[214:16.92]They would have just bailed.
[214:19.86]But he's trying so hard to remain... I don't know what the word would be.
[214:28.41]But at the end of the day, it's a fake company pretending to be brother's support.
[214:36.24]Yeah, interestingly enough in the beginning he remember he asked what kind of printer do you have and We told him it was brother and he said that he they fixed all kinds of printers But their website says it's like official brother dot support or whatever He's a counterfeiter but not a scammer well
[214:59.96]what he's doing is illegal and either way but yeah I don't know I don't know if they're going to call back and say um here's a let's buy a new printer yeah he's a fraud one way or another yeah and what we don't know guys is we don't know
[215:19.07]what happens next we don't know if they call us back a week later and say that um there's uh infections we don't know if they sell it to or the the refund scammers call back later but well um gosh that that was a pleasure I mean I don't know what how you are on on time if you want to hang out for a while I'm I'm I'm good for you I'm good for a little while yeah definitely okay
[215:47.51]um yeah normally I stream at least like another hour or so so we could try calling that one but I don't know about you but that that was an hour and 50 minutes that just like flew by for me like clockwork did you say that's just 10 hours stream pog no no probably not that but um everybody said this isn't a dyi print repair show
[216:19.01]do it yourself it was very very patient even with the insanity I I'm surprised he was so patient still he was so ready to yeah the keep it going yeah um for those of I'm trying to think of a good for some because some people I don't know if
[216:41.04]the right word to me one of the the biggest mistakes if or I don't want to call it mistakes but the big thing that he did um that's in question is when he's he's claiming to have fixed our printer right now but he I closed out of the printer install I wasn't even halfway done it was like looking it was trying to detect our printer the reason I closed it out is because it would never have found our printer because I don't have a printer
[217:10.35]But he's trying to claim that he fixed it that way he can like charge us So so yeah, I want so I wonder if if you were to say yeah, it's fixed at printer prints would then he say okay Let's get you over here.
[217:21.56]That'll be $600.
[217:22.16]Yeah, I mean it could it would have been any range of Charge, but obviously it's not fixed and he didn't do it so right that that alone is like
[217:36.06]it's maybe not that crazy of a scam because I've had them I've had them call with police sirens in the background and say that the police are about to show up and I'm being deported out of the country like that's crazy right yeah that's it that's insane but the guy's lying and yeah I would be curious to see if he calls us back in a little bit if um yeah I don't know if we say like
[218:01.24]it works again and see we'll just see if they try to sell us something yeah we'll see how it plays out I guess somebody said we need to keep your printer under observation yeah what's that all about yeah what does that mean keep your printer under it I think it just means I don't really know how I'm gonna do this right now can can I have someone else call you tomorrow although yeah some people in chat were saying he's probably just never gonna call back which is
[218:31.87]It's possible, but he spent almost two hours.
[218:34.77]He's either in or he's out, you know, at this point.
[218:39.97]Yeah.
[218:41.43]Mr. Green, people are saying.
[218:44.27]I'm not familiar.
[218:46.08]It's a character that plays Blackjack.
[218:49.64]Ah, okay.
[218:50.44]It's one of the characters.
[218:53.14]Mr. Green, I think, is too over the top for what we're doing, though.
[218:57.18]I think that would be an immediate hang-up.
[219:04.20]I mean what we were doing wasn't over the top like pretending to pour water on printers and stand on chairs and stuff I know um I I I try I was I was about to lose my composure like three or four times when when he was realizing how much liquid and we were talking about how much was in there sloshing around and he's like when he said five to seven minutes
[219:24.91]And then he said 30, and I'm just like, hold on.
[219:27.36]This is like, this is going to take like three days.
[219:30.34]It's not going to dry.
[219:31.14]And then he ended up saying something like, oh.
[219:34.36]Can you imagine dumping 32 ounces of liquid into a printer?
[219:38.98]It's like, that printer, no, not five minutes.
[219:43.31]He's like, just get a towel and wipe it up, wipe it up.
[219:46.15]He had the patience of an absolute saint.
[219:48.07]True.
[219:50.79]True.
[219:53.20]I guess if he's thinking he gets, yeah, $500 printer into the oven.
[220:00.71]What sane human being would ever say that someone was saying that I think he was laughing at one point too, but that's, I think that's one.
[220:13.27]That's part of what makes this like fun for me every day is that they don't know.
[220:22.73]Pepe laughs they don't know but it's not real life right so it's like some huge inside joke kind of a we're just they think that there's actually an old man and woman who were considering putting a printer in their dryer spin cycle yeah he thinks that that actually was happening if you put a printer into a dryer just the noise alone
[220:53.50]deafening I wonder how quickly I could that would be goofy to have playing in the background when he calls back like it's just in there we've got it in the dryer right now well you know if you want us to take it home you open it up and it's like well I don't know mark the thing's in about a million pieces do you got the tape yeah oh announcement who's that
[221:22.93]Announcement.
[221:25.23]I think it's him.
[221:25.95]Announcement.
[221:30.31]Hello, this is Bernice.
[221:32.18]This is James.
[221:35.74]I'm calling from the sales team of Brother Printer.
[221:38.68]How can I help you today?
[221:40.86]Oh, God.
[221:41.76]God, can you help us?
[221:43.59]I hope you can help us.
[221:45.85]Are you on the phone?
[221:47.03]Yeah, yeah.
[221:48.25]The brother sales guy.
[221:52.07]Okay.
[221:54.41]Yeah, can you hear us?
[221:55.19]I got my husband on the phone.
[221:57.73]Yeah.
[221:58.80]I got to know the issues about your printer, okay?
[222:03.32]This is the same guy, right?
[222:05.68]He just cut his voice out.
[222:08.18]We can fix your printer and get it in shape and your computer too with all the problems and it will cost you somewhere around $250, okay?
[222:16.81]So...
[222:20.79]Could you repeat that part?
[222:23.59]Repeat it.
[222:24.79]What was it again?
[222:27.97]We are going to go ahead and get your printer fixed with all the technical issues and everything.
[222:34.09]Get it working in the next one hour.
[222:36.77]Get your computer working.
[222:38.51]Basically, we'll remove all the junk from your computer.
[222:41.77]We'll fix all the viruses, everything.
[222:44.31]And it will cost you $250.
[222:45.23]Would that be okay?
[222:45.77]Okay.
[222:49.84]I don't even know what to say.
[222:55.34]$250.
[222:56.98]How much is the new printer?
[223:02.26]We were hoping there would be maybe some way that you could overnight a new printer to us.
[223:09.34]I don't know if the other guy explained to you.
[223:12.84]My husband accidentally spilled about 32 ounces of Pepsi product.
[223:18.49]I didn't accidentally... James, I didn't accidentally spill anything.
[223:22.17]I was knocked out of my hand because I was sporadically moving around because we were stressed out over here.
[223:26.64]She knocked that out of my hands and it dumped onto the planet.
[223:28.82]So I accidentally...
[223:31.49]was near my husband and he then fumbled and spilled 32 ounces of premium Pepsi product into our printer and no problem what I'm saying is we'll get your printer working yeah we will fix it up it will take one or two hours to fix that and also we would like to tell you that we will fix yes and I will fix your computer as well but it will cost 250 dollars
[224:02.51]what kind of hold on that's a bundle that's a bundle deal yes does this include the computer plus the printers the port which is good for one year for one year we'll be fixing all the issues free of cost for you after taking this one-time payment for an entire year
[224:26.46]Wait, it's going to take a year?
[224:28.02]That's how long I was estimating it would take for the fridge to dry out.
[224:32.42]Are you saying it's going to take about a year?
[224:33.88]Oh, sorry, the printer?
[224:35.76]Oh, it's not going to take a year for the printer to dry out.
[224:38.58]It'll take probably a day, maybe an hour.
[224:42.92]Okay.
[224:45.75]God, is this a good deal?
[224:47.57]We haven't bought anything in a while.
[224:50.59]So what else comes with the bundle?
[224:54.04]The fridge?
[224:55.02]We'll provide you a security for the computer.
[224:57.69]Let me type it on the notepad, okay?
[224:59.91]Okay.
[225:01.59]You know, maybe this is... They say God works in mysterious ways.
[225:04.55]Maybe he's trying to... Maybe he's... Smote?
[225:08.46]Smit?
[225:08.96]We will fix your PC.
[225:14.62]We will fix the viruses.
[225:19.78]Wait, what viruses?
[225:20.84]In the fridge?
[225:22.18]I mean, there's probably a few viruses in the meat that's in the fridge right now because I may have unplugged it.
[225:29.35]True.
[225:29.87]No, I'm talking only about the computer, okay?
[225:32.77]The computer and the printer.
[225:34.93]We will fix all the issues and we'll give you free support.
[225:39.37]How does this dude have access to some random new guy?
[225:42.61]For one year, there will be a free support.
[225:44.97]You can give us a call and we'll fix all the issues for one year.
[225:50.98]for just $249.99.
[225:54.50]Wow.
[225:56.14]Talk about a bundle, huh?
[225:59.34]That's four, that's five, six.
[226:01.46]That's six things in the bundle.
[226:04.72]James, can you break this down?
[226:06.08]Can you break down how much individually this would cost?
[226:09.76]This is Mark, correct?
[226:11.34]Mark?
[226:13.54]No, this is James from the sales team.
[226:16.89]Okay, so you're telling Mark what to write on our computer then?
[226:21.81]No.
[226:22.49]Computer and printer repair.
[226:25.82]What happened to Mark?
[226:26.66]For one year.
[226:30.24]He was from the technical team.
[226:32.72]I am from the sales team.
[226:36.22]Oh, okay.
[226:39.22]Two different teams.
[226:40.08]Can I go ahead and process the payment for you?
[226:44.06]Okay.
[226:45.64]Let's talk about how much extra does it cost if we were to bundle in the fridge repairs?
[226:51.77]Because Mark was talking about... No, we are only talking about the computer and the printer repair.
[226:57.87]That's it.
[226:58.55]No fridge.
[226:59.47]Wait a minute here.
[227:03.17]I mean, I was told there would be potential fridge troubleshooting.
[227:10.00]No, only the computer and the printer repair.
[227:14.99]Now, Mark was, don't get me wrong, he seemed like a nice guy.
[227:19.78]But if we buy this, are we forced to talk to Mark every single time?
[227:28.11]Yeah, he's a technical person.
[227:30.79]If you want, I can assign a different guy for you or for the technical thing.
[227:36.58]Well, he was a little bit.
[227:37.86]How would you describe him, honey?
[227:39.14]He was a little bit.
[227:41.44]I think he overpromised a few things.
[227:43.05]I think, you know, he said he was a Jack of all trades.
[227:45.43]Yes.
[227:47.49]He told us he could face the French.
[227:48.59]He's a very intelligent guy.
[227:49.91]I wouldn't say intelligent.
[227:51.47]He is a certified engineer.
[227:53.27]That's not the word I would use.
[227:54.87]I mean, he seemed happy.
[228:02.15]He is.
[228:02.91]He wanted to help you guys, and that's why he transferred your call to the sales team to me.
[228:08.70]And I would like to propose you an offer wherein if you pay $249, we will be taking care of all your computer and printer problems for one year free of cost.
[228:21.71]That means you can get the issues repair free of cost for entire one year.
[228:29.22]Wait, why would we need to keep getting our printer repaired?
[228:31.72]I don't understand.
[228:34.08]But how do you fix a printer over and over again?
[228:36.54]Is it like insurance?
[228:38.36]So if my husband spills a large beverage on the printer again, you guys will... And there it is.
[228:45.23]And there we go.
[228:46.17]Of course you bring it up.
[228:48.43]And there we go.
[228:49.39]I'm just saying, it doesn't have to be anybody's fault.
[228:51.65]Hey, Mark, we're off to the races.
[228:55.70]Can you explain a little bit, Mark?
[228:58.47]Sorry, James?
[229:00.37]James, is it Mark?
[229:01.62]I don't know.
[229:02.44]Do you mind if I call you?
[229:05.30]Let me tell you.
[229:08.22]Anyway, what is the process like?
[229:11.54]So we have 32 ounces of liquid that was poured into our printer.
[229:17.62]It's still sloshing around.
[229:18.96]Do you have to come to our house to fix it, or you're saying it's going to take about an hour?
[229:26.08]So I don't think you're about to get on a bus.
[229:28.94]You're not here in Chicago, are you?
[229:33.50]No, we are in Alabama.
[229:35.80]Oh, no kidding.
[229:37.74]Whereabouts in Alabama?
[229:39.20]Are you near Sweet Home?
[229:41.52]We've got family in Alabama.
[229:42.84]No, we... Yeah, we have family in Sweet Home.
[229:48.24]Okay, no, we are not there.
[229:51.78]Let me tell you that the charge that I'm telling you, $249, it is for the printer and the computer support.
[229:59.21]for complete one year.
[230:00.70]So do you want me to register you guys?
[230:03.56]Well, yeah.
[230:04.30]I mean, I just want to be clear.
[230:05.70]I want to make sure that I understand.
[230:07.98]The bundle that you have before us today, does it include some sort of... Our printer that we have with us today is going to be fixed in an hour, correct?
[230:22.33]Yes.
[230:23.35]Okay, so you're going to somehow... Can you describe the process of how you're going to...
[230:30.21]What would the word be, honey?
[230:31.03]I don't even know the word.
[230:32.05]We will be installing the drivers of your printer.
[230:37.43]Yeah, it will be a guaranteed support, okay?
[230:41.11]And let me tell you that we'll be installing all the drivers of your printer.
[230:47.24]Oh, no, Mark already did that.
[230:50.36]Mark already did that, and then the liquid got involved, and then that's when we're talking about the sales team, and then that's when you showed up.
[231:01.30]The part I'm most interested in, I understand the bundle.
[231:09.19]Can you give me a little bit of an understanding?
[231:11.87]Because you're not going to come to our house.
[231:14.35]You're doing it over the phone.
[231:15.83]How long do we have to stay on the phone?
[231:18.15]Do we have to be on the phone while you do it?
[231:20.43]Maybe like one, yeah, one and a half hour.
[231:24.71]Oh, it might be longer than an hour, you're saying.
[231:27.59]Now, what do you do?
[231:30.05]Do we have to install an app, like some kind of vacuum cleaner app on our phone to suction the liquid out?
[231:35.94]No, no, no.
[231:37.70]What are you going to do to get the liquid out of our printer?
[231:42.47]That's the number one problem, James.
[231:44.95]We got liquid in the printer.
[231:46.17]I'm sorry, he hung up.
[231:47.41]I'm sorry.
[231:50.59]He hung up right there.
[231:51.79]Maybe I lost him.
[231:55.11]But like, how is this guy?
[231:58.19]There's the scam, by the way.
[232:00.23]A vacuum app.
[232:01.85]It's just like... I'm sorry.
[232:05.33]He was broken.
[232:07.01]But there's the scam, though, Chad.
[232:10.33]The guy's telling us, I'll fix your printer in an hour and a half.
[232:15.39]We poured 32 ounces of water in it.
[232:21.50]I kept trying to... The reason I kept doing that is because obviously he has no way to explain how they're going to fix the printer.
[232:28.11]But I don't... When I kept asking him, how are you going to do it?
[232:32.50]He was avoiding the question.
[232:34.54]So I was trying to... I'm going to... Mark is really intelligent.
[232:40.51]He's an engineer.
[232:41.21]He's a super intelligent guy.
[232:47.00]I'm going to try to call him back quick just to see if... Oh, the phone call cut out.
[232:50.64]The phone call cut out.
[232:52.64]Oh, okay.
[232:54.00]I'll see if sometimes they'll talk to you.
[232:57.50]Colin telling there's a virus on the Roomba.
[233:00.30]You know what?
[233:00.64]I'm trying to think of it.
[233:01.50]The Roomba's been going around the house.
[233:04.52]Yeah, the Roomba's been just staying on the carpet spinning.
[233:08.88]I swear the other day when it bumped in the wall, it had some kind of expletive.
[233:14.27]We got one clean spot on the house.
[233:15.89]It's just one circle where the Roomba spins.
[233:18.15]Yeah, it's shiny.
[233:18.81]Everything else is dirt and dust.
[233:20.49]It buffed it.
[233:21.99]It's like a buffing wheel.
[233:27.28]A mobile buffing.
[233:30.14]Let me.
[233:31.90]The fridge part is the funniest thing for me because he did say very clearly that he was going to help fix the fridge, didn't he, in the very beginning?
[233:39.32]Multiple times.
[233:40.92]I'm calling him, but we're muted.
[233:45.61]Yeah, I'm calling him, but we're muted.
[233:47.83]So yeah, the fridge, he definitely said yes, maybe more than once for sure.
[234:02.49]Plug your fridge back in like text now subscriber you were trying to read Please leave your message after the tip.
[234:09.99]I didn't realize that so another thing not that it super matters But text now is a free you can go get a phone number for free to just like do calls on and It's a classic
[234:25.02]the actual brother printer support isn't going to have a you know a free you know internet phone number that says like a voip number yeah yeah the text now subscriber yeah he's just not answering when he sees me call back now that would have it with the bundle can you can you bundle anything I know you don't fix the fridge but could you add some kind of
[234:50.04]Just out of context, reading this from top to bottom is hysterical.
[234:55.16]We will fix your PC.
[234:56.68]We will fix the viruses.
[234:58.20]We will take care of all the issues.
[234:59.98]PC and printer.
[235:01.00]Free support one year.
[235:02.58]Fix it for $249.
[235:04.12]Computer and printer repair for one year.
[235:07.04]No fridge or other appliance.
[235:10.16]Like, do you have to make that clear in the terms?
[235:14.00]No fridge.
[235:16.15]Of course not.
[235:17.41]You must remove all appliances from the area.
[235:19.87]No appliance.
[235:21.78]Like we're eventually going to like way overstep our bounds and be like, you know, like the coffee maker is having some problems.
[235:28.40]Can you help?
[235:31.28]We have done some stuff like that before where I've tried to be like, well, yeah, the microwave isn't really working.
[235:38.85]The Bluetooth...
[235:41.15]Someone in chat once said like ask him about your bluetooth toilet plunger or something and because they'll they'll ask me sometimes these guys will Will pull up like here.
[235:52.25]I'll show you I'll So he can't see what I'm doing anymore, but they'll open up the command prompt.
[236:00.10]Oh, it's green Another scammer turned it green but
[236:06.90]And they run a command like net stat or They type tree.
[236:12.98]So it looks like it's scanning and then they'll they'll say like Network infected.
[236:19.02]Well, you've seen this.
[236:19.96]Oh, look at all this.
[236:20.92]Yeah, and Look at all this data is spelled infected wrong.
[236:25.14]And yeah, I did well anyway, and that's just what they do so Network infected.
[236:33.54]Oh, you can see the background.
[236:34.65]I said they hit it.
[236:35.81]Oh
[236:37.68]That was the birthday.
[236:38.74]The rat's birthday.
[236:42.01]And they'll ask you, like, how much stuff do you have on your network?
[236:45.03]Like, well, we've got the fridge.
[236:46.17]We've got the... What kind of appliances?
[236:48.57]Instead of listing off.
[236:53.92]I'll try calling him one more time just to see.
[236:56.20]That was a pleasure.
[236:57.96]That was a lot of fun.
[237:00.98]That was a lot of fun, yeah.
[237:02.87]So, a random question.
[237:04.67]When you go through with this, if you actually keep them on and they go through, okay, let's pay for this.
[237:10.03]Is their plan, this free support for one year, do they just delete your number after this?
[237:15.87]If you were to pay for this, when you called back for support two months later, is it what you just experienced?
[237:24.00]The number does not exist.
[237:25.42]It's kind of debatable.
[237:27.56]Sometimes...
[237:29.22]people do call back but from what I understand if they talk to you because I've even tried calling before and just giving them different um like oh my customer id is x y whatever and announcement um let me just check and make sure it's not them really quick hello this is beneath hello
[237:59.53]yes this is beneath uh sorry I'm a little busy right now I have no idea who that is chat didn't hear it I have no clue who that is so I'm just gonna hang up um what did he say like insurance.com insurance.free okay um
[238:30.46]So your question, yeah, sometimes they will answer, but then they just tell you, oh, well, see, the problem is you're, they make up something else and say, we have to buy X, Y, Z to fix it.
[238:44.41]And that's going to cost more money.
[238:47.59]Or there are times where the phone number doesn't exist anymore, or they'll say we don't have any records.
[238:53.63]So it can be hit or miss.
[238:56.42]So they just try to essentially sometimes keep you sort of forever in the loop of just constantly giving them money.
[239:03.83]And eventually you have like a $3,000 bill for what is simply them just pretending to run virus scans on your computer.
[239:12.27]Yeah.
[239:12.73]And then I suppose the other... I think sometimes they try to say that what they're doing is within...
[239:23.50]like, what would you say, within legal terms?
[239:27.30]Because they'll say, well, what we really did is we sold a one-year support package.
[239:34.50]So when you sign up on their website, because the next step would be they would ask you for your credit card and they would go on their website and have you...
[239:43.85]Like sometimes they have you sign a document even really quick.
[239:47.65]Really?
[239:48.49]And the doc, what you're buying is one year of tech support services.
[239:54.41]You're not buying like a fixed printer or you're not, you know, it's like a very open ended thing.
[240:02.37]I just want to hire you for my, I want to be able to call you.
[240:07.62]Yeah.
[240:08.16]And so I think what they try to do if they get in trouble or something like, no, no, no, we just, we just sell, um, like one year support packages to our customers.
[240:17.14]They can call us anytime.
[240:18.45]And like, maybe she misunderstood, maybe she misunderstood.
[240:23.55]I think it's just there.
[240:24.95]They try to get away with it that way too.
[240:28.41]Wow.
[240:30.96]Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[240:31.86]That was all over the place.
[240:34.36]Yeah.
[240:35.56]I call him one more time.
[240:37.56]But seems like he intentionally doesn't want to talk to us anymore.
[240:44.83]So do you price match by the way, because we're just talking to someone else.
[240:59.79]Oh, he left my computer.
[241:03.13]He's gone.
[241:03.57]I think I'm done with this.
[241:05.73]Oh, I think he answered.
[241:08.23]Hello?
[241:14.13]Oh.
[241:15.17]Okay.
[241:15.77]I think, yeah.
[241:19.55]Is he answering and going like, nope, not this lady.
[241:21.61]No, no, no, no, not again, not again.
[241:24.27]Probably.
[241:24.87]Oh, man.
[241:27.13]Well, I mean...
[241:28.59]You call him back, have like a fire alarm going.
[241:33.64]My husband, he put it in the dryer or the oven, like you said.
[241:37.24]You told me to put it in a dryer.
[241:38.88]I asked Mark and he said it would be safe.
[241:41.84]I know I didn't buy that bundle yet, but... Is that support still available?
[241:47.73]We might need some house support.
[241:49.69]We might need some support with a dryer, support with some drywall.
[241:54.79]Liquid heat.
[241:55.69]Do you guys cover...
[241:58.63]oof well that's yeah I mean that's the the full story it seemed really legit in the beginning and you can see um I don't know about you guys chat but you could see especially in the beginning
[242:13.47]that it seems kind of legitimate.
[242:15.43]And if you're not super tech savvy, that you might go along with it.
[242:21.02]And then all of a sudden they're saying, yeah, we'll fix things that are impossible to fix and charge you $250 to fix it even though.
[242:30.37]It's amazing.
[242:31.33]It really is amazing how just for the first 45 minutes, that really could have just been somebody trying to fix your printer.
[242:40.21]And then they get it to a point where it's like, oh, but now let's charge them 250 bucks for this kind of in perpetuity service.
[242:47.29]And I'm going to pretend to be another guy.
[242:50.58]Yeah.
[242:51.49]Well, someone asked, what if Mark never fixed it without calling James?
[242:55.03]I think the general consensus was that was Mark and not somebody else.
[243:02.13]But either way, this is typically what would what would happen at the end is they in ninety nine percent of the cases, they've always presented this support plan.
[243:12.76]So.
[243:14.40]Um, yeah in the very beginning he made like a different voice.
[243:17.68]I don't forget.
[243:18.29]I forgot what he did He was like, hey, this is James and then it like he dropped it two seconds later.
[243:24.21]So Well Jerma this was an absolute blast.
[243:28.67]I don't like I don't want to To keep you if you don't want like if you want I I'm gonna be around a little bit longer so I'll probably do one more call but I
[243:38.26]I don't want to pressure you at all.
[243:40.10]I know you're a busy guy.
[243:41.24]So this was incredible.
[243:44.12]If you want to do a couple of solo ones, I mean, whatever you want to do.
[243:48.96]It really does not matter to me.
[243:50.64]I normally only ask that people hop on for a little bit because I don't want to take up their whole time.
[243:54.80]But if you have the time, I would be honored to have you.
[243:57.98]If you don't, I will just say thank you so much for being here for the time you were here.
[244:02.95]No pressure whatsoever.
[244:04.39]Either way.
[244:05.61]I can stay for one more.
[244:07.13]You can kind of do your thing, and if you want to pull me in, if you want to give me something to do, I can just hang out.
[244:13.27]I'll just sit in the call, and if you're like, hey, come on in and be this person.
[244:17.05]I'll stick around for one more.
[244:18.72]I think, yeah, this has been a blast.
[244:21.92]One more.
[244:22.76]What do they say?
[244:23.36]One more.
[244:26.88]I'll tell you what.
[244:28.24]If you promise to fix our printer if we accidentally spill 32 ounces of
[244:34.08]We'll do one more.
[244:38.67]Let me see who's available, actually.
[244:40.81]Go get a towel in the laundry room.
[244:44.85]I kid you not.
[244:45.65]And by the way, when I lifted the printer up, I didn't realize this.
[244:47.75]I'm thinking, you know, in hindsight here.
[244:51.19]We were talking about how heavy the printer was.
[244:53.02]It was like 200 pounds.
[244:56.08]Is this a industrial, like, Xerox machine?
[244:59.42]Maybe.
[245:01.18]Why would it be 200 pounds?
[245:03.93]That's true.
[245:04.35]Is it like six feet tall?
[245:08.32]I don't know.
[245:08.74]Speaking of water, I'm going to go get a glass of water and I'll just kind of jump back in and I'll be hanging out in the column.
[245:18.36]Whenever you want to give me a thing to say or do, I will gladly hop on for one more for sure.
[245:24.35]Okay.
[245:24.81]Sounds good, man.
[245:30.87]Isn't he so intelligent?
[245:32.66]sorry that now in context that sounds it's been I'm having uh so maybe maybe I try calling that Amazon one um the Amazon we found an iPhone are we friends now I mean I would
[246:02.58]If I was having a birthday, I would invite him to my birthday.
[246:06.36]I don't know the best way to say it.
[246:12.71]If I was a... I can't help myself from making... If I was a rat, I would.
[246:21.73]If... Okay.
[246:24.31]If... If I was going to have a birthday, a party, and...
[246:32.88]there wasn't like you know covet and like lockdowns and all that type of stuff I I wouldn't I would invite him to come to my birthday yeah that's what I'm saying I would he would be invited to my birthday bash so I don't know if that's friends or maybe more than
[247:02.98]Alright, let me maybe best friend.
[247:04.88]I don't know.
[247:06.18]That's for what is this?
[247:18.41]Hello?
[247:18.81]Hello.
[247:25.49]Okay, bye.
[247:26.23]Alright.
[247:32.68]I'm not really sure what that was about I got this voicemail earlier saying that uh someone had purchased an iPhone in my with my Amazon account and I just called them but nothing yeah Jerma said he was going to get a drink I think I haven't been drinking enough I have not been hydrating
[248:02.62]do a mom and son I mean I could try to play you mean his mom play as mama there's an alert call from Amazon a purchase has been made from your Amazon account for an apple iPhone for an amount of 529 dollars to dispute yeah oh yeah but when I call them
[249:02.15]Is someone there on the phone is is this connected to Amazon?
[249:13.24]Hello?
[249:23.16]Okay, well, that's, that's interesting.
[249:26.13]It's like it immediately answers and puts you there.
[249:34.74]always has been I've got the cash app I've got yeah so cash app and quickbooks what what's the what's the cash app one oh welcome back oh um that's fine I'm back so a cash app usually they're just trying to steal your account so they will say um
[250:05.84]great, what's your phone number associated with the account and your email?
[250:10.63]And then if they try to connect to your account, they'll do the two factor authentication thing where you get a text or an email and they'll say, um, oh, great.
[250:21.67]What are the numbers?
[250:22.39]That's for, that's how we verify it's you.
[250:25.61]And then as soon as you give them the numbers, now they, now they're on your account.
[250:29.34]they can just start transferring um oh that's not good funds or they want to connect to your phone with something like team viewer and start transferring funds out of it either way so normally I just call them up and just treat it like they're actually cash app support and ask them questions
[250:52.88]Like, oh, I've been really interested in using Cash App.
[250:55.44]Can you tell me more about it?
[250:56.88]Or is it good for businesses?
[250:59.62]Whatever.
[250:59.98]And they get upset because they just want to scam you.
[251:02.98]They don't want to talk to you about their product.
[251:05.78]They could care less about the product.
[251:08.96]They just want you to give them money.
[251:11.18]That's crazy.
[251:12.62]Which is similar to the QuickBooks one I have.
[251:15.88]Sometimes I just goof around and ask them about taxes and whatever.
[251:20.22]But
[251:22.57]Um, yeah, so we could try one of those or, um, let me check my voicemails.
[251:32.74]the refund scams are going to be too long at this point because it takes them like an hour just to connect to your bank account so it'll take we can't do that I've seen a lot of those before too where you have like the fake account and the html editing and yeah they end up being really neat for so imagine what we and I'm not trying to belittle what we just did because it was a blast but imagine that happening
[252:01.20]And then them believing that we have a million dollars in our bank account.
[252:06.42]They're going to call back tomorrow for sure.
[252:09.42]They're going to call back every day.
[252:12.34]And they'll put up with whatever you want because they believe that they're going to be able to steal a million dollars.
[252:19.79]Those are kind of fun.
[252:24.31]You will keep that person along for as long as you feel like keeping the call going.
[252:31.49]Yeah.
[252:32.65]Have you dealt with a scam from the federal issuing an arrest warrant?
[252:37.90]Yes, I can see if I was trying those a little bit before, um, Jerma got on.
[252:45.84]They usually get really mad if you put two people on there, but we could try to just do it anyway.
[252:54.61]Yeah, like I said, for at least the next one you get going, whenever you, if you were just like, you know what, it's been like 15, 20 minutes.
[253:01.82]Alright, let's see if we can bring a second person in.
[253:05.06]Like, I'm around here now if you want to use me.
[253:07.58]Okay.
[253:09.10]I'll just be hanging out.
[253:09.96]I'll just be chilling.
[253:11.83]Yeah, or it could be, I'm trying to think of what I...
[253:19.86]we got the right one on I could oh actually my lawyers on the phone I could get my lawyer on the phone or my my brother's a cop and just he's right next to me or whatever yeah well I usually don't get on and be like cops but you get them because they say that we found 22 pounds of cocaine in your car and you're being arrested by the federal government so yeah my brother read a few legal books
[253:44.73]There you go.
[253:45.87]My brothers in law school are like, oh, I think my brother watched Breaking Bad.
[253:49.83]He's probably pretty.
[253:53.91]Yeah, I've seen the first two seasons of Breaking Bad.
[253:56.03]I think I know what I'm talking about.
[253:57.33]He's familiar with the casework.
[253:59.29]I did that once.
[254:01.91]Are you used to watch CSI?
[254:04.28]Yeah.
[254:05.60]You can pretend to be a PI.
[254:06.68]Oh, okay.
[254:08.18]At one time I did say like, alright, arrest me.
[254:11.32]And that was, it was kind of goofy, but they just hang up on me.
[254:15.01]Arrest me.
[254:16.29]You're like, alright, you're, you found me.
[254:19.51]Where'd you find the car guys?
[254:21.11]Like, God, it's a lot of money sitting in that car.
[254:25.13]22 pounds.
[254:27.64]Somebody said I'm a moderator, a moderator on our legal advice.
[254:34.74]yeah I'm pretty good at this stuff let me see if I can get him on the phone that'll be the question your call is very important to us please stay on the line and you'll be transferred to the next available agent
[255:17.37]Beautiful What happened to the body did you find that It's music
[255:42.16]Oh, remember how I was talking about those guys that called me like 1,500 times?
[255:46.53]I found out that... So I'm using a VoIP system myself, and I found out that I accidentally had... My hold music was something just like this, like when I put them on hold.
[256:01.23]And when they called me, it would say something like extension five Oh five is on the phone.
[256:08.75]Please leave a message.
[256:10.17]And like whose cell phone says that like what 80 year old woman has a cell phone that says that.
[256:18.24]And yet they told me for weeks, like a doctor's office.
[256:23.52]Yeah.
[256:25.46]Oh, apparently a couple of people in chat.
[256:26.92]Oh, okay.
[256:27.70]Nevermind.
[256:28.66]It's pretty normal.
[256:31.98]I don't think they're going to answer.
[256:33.54]Let me try one of those Amazon iPhone ones.
[256:35.72]Those are usually pretty goofy.
[256:49.91]As I was getting water, I was coming kind of back up the stairs and I just started laughing at the oven printer in the oven thing.
[256:57.37]Like I just keep thinking about an old couple just putting it on warm.
[257:03.81]Like you do with an old pizza.
[257:05.55]Like a leftover pizza.
[257:07.29]Yeah, like a leftover.
[257:08.37]Actually, that's a good question.
[257:11.75]Do you... If you consume pizza and you have leftovers, cold or warm?
[257:22.77]Like, do you heat it up again?
[257:25.08]Toaster oven.
[257:26.36]Alright.
[257:28.90]Cold pizza's alright, but you gotta get it from the right place.
[257:32.46]What's the perfect pizza to you?
[257:35.09]Perfect pizza to me is just a thin crust, pepperoni, crispy.
[257:40.11]That's it.
[257:41.85]Okay.
[257:43.21]Thin crust pepperoni.
[257:44.45]People were asking when we were gone if we were going to be friends.
[257:47.36]I think that we can be based on that answer.
[257:50.32]Alright, yeah.
[257:51.46]Pizza friends.
[257:53.18]Crispy.
[257:55.78]I don't like thick crust pizza.
[257:57.78]Drives me crazy.
[257:58.86]It doesn't count.
[257:59.71]Neither do I. It doesn't count to me.
[258:01.87]Pizza buddies.
[258:02.41]Alright, yeah, pizza buddies.
[258:03.41]I wasn't sure...
[258:04.91]what level of friendship we would at least at least pizza buddies yeah we we at least they're on the on the pizza friend tier I don't know what character to be uh yeah hello hello can you hear me yeah yeah I just got your call about um an iPhone being purchased
[258:35.96]see you later I wonder if they're looking up people too so why why okay so why hang up there I don't know this is also I've watched you a bunch of times but being in it it's like being here why hang up there I don't know oh interestingly enough in the voicemail it says call back Amazon billing and it has a 1-800 number but I didn't call it 1-800 I wonder if
[259:07.96]was some other business but it seemed yeah every single one of these voicemails they're calling from one number and then they have another phone number to call in the voicemail so maybe that was a legitimate because you can spoof numbers you know um yeah maybe that was part of the problem we try con
[259:37.73]Yeah, do you want to be like my ex-boyfriend who ordered the iPhone or something?
[259:41.31]I don't know.
[259:42.01]Or be my... Yeah, however you want to pull me in.

[274:04.89]Might be a little over the top for somebody that's trying to reel us into a scam.
[274:12.77]I mean, they might.
[274:18.34]Selling paper to paper, like in the office.
[274:22.93]Like a coffee, like just coffee, like a coffee company.
[274:26.77]That it is kind of, yeah, we could come over zealously, but we have this like super great new idea.
[274:33.05]We're like taking coffee to a level that no one has seen coffee before.
[274:40.90]Drive-thru coffee, which gets poured into your mouth at the drive-thru.
[274:45.65]Yeah.
[274:46.11]Imagine how much time.
[274:47.07]It takes 15 seconds, 15 seconds for McDonald's or any of these places to pour a cup of coffee into a cup and hand it to you, to your car.
[274:58.30]Our product.
[274:59.28]You lean out and you pour it into your mouth.
[275:05.32]As you're driving, it cuts down.
[275:08.60]15 seconds, that adds up.
[275:09.54]That's millions of minutes a year that people are wasting.
[275:13.23]That's trillions of dollars.
[275:14.59]It's good for the environment.
[275:19.58]Yeah.
[275:20.48]Anything like that will be fine.
[275:24.18]I'm trying to think.
[275:25.64]It's too obvious.
[275:33.31]Yeah.
[275:33.81]I mean, casino is fine.
[275:37.07]Anything's fine with me.
[275:38.19]I mean, you tell me.
[275:39.45]What is your...
[275:42.11]we said fancy water fancy water that we just call fancy we get it out of the tap and we just sell it as fancy water yeah yeah out of curiosity I probably won't do that kid voice but um hey out of curiosity out of curiosity I'm wondering uh see I in the city you could be are you gonna be like Mr. green
[276:07.88]could be your um I I I I'll try to dial it back a little so it's not like super cartoonish and over the top okay because I I could always I could be your your uncle your cousin or whatever it is that's coming in with the the uh I got the money but I don't understand how everything's working with the water
[276:30.29]Making a new, making a new product.
[276:31.91]This product is going to be a casino.
[276:35.81]Hear me out on this.
[276:36.53]A casino underground.
[276:40.32]And we'll want to find out.
[276:41.52]In a series of tunnels.
[276:43.72]Just like how the internet is.
[276:45.66]A series of pipes.
[276:46.38]A series of tubes.
[276:48.48]Yeah.
[276:48.66]Alright, let's roll with it.
[276:50.70]So they pretend to be QuickBooks, um,
[276:54.74]We can ask them some questions.
[276:55.82]They may want to connect to the computer and look at our QuickBooks.
[276:59.30]But I think I have all that stuff set up.
[277:04.32]Cave Zeno.
[277:06.62]Cave Zeno.
[277:10.12]This call is being recorded.
[277:11.92]If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time.
[277:15.73]Please hold while I try to connect you.
[277:32.02]Thank you very much for calling.
[277:32.96]You're speaking to Brian.
[277:34.24]How may I help you?
[277:36.50]Hey there, Brian.
[277:37.85]I'm calling about y'all's QuickBooks software.
[277:45.77]Okay.
[277:46.51]What is the problem you're facing with your QuickBooks software, sir?
[277:50.23]My business partner and I, we've been trying to get things situated partially for legal purposes.
[277:58.98]We got a startup we're doing.
[278:01.27]And right now, because of the COVID, we can't really share the same office right now.
[278:07.73]So we're trying to set up the QuickBooks.
[278:14.75]And my business partner, I think I have him on a conference call.
[278:19.22]I don't know if he's here or not.
[278:20.66]I had him on conference call.
[278:21.70]Yeah, I'm here.
[278:22.92]Okay, okay, good.
[278:23.70]He's on the phone.
[278:24.82]Can you hear me?
[278:26.64]Yeah, can you hear him okay?
[278:32.06]Hello, can you hear us?
[278:36.24]Yes, sir, I can hear you.
[278:37.90]Okay, good.
[278:38.76]So we had the QuickBooks set up, you know, but right now, after we switched to our laptops and everything,
[278:48.34]we're having some problems using it on the computer.
[278:50.56]So we had a couple, we have basically two problems.
[278:53.36]One, we have a couple questions about upgrading the software and some of the features y'all have.
[278:59.10]And the other one is, what do we do to get it working on the laptop?
[279:05.22]Yeah, connectivity is kind of what we're all about here.
[279:07.68]Yeah, and if that's two separate phone calls, like if one is more of a sales call and one is more of a, I'm not a computer guy.
[279:16.00]I'm more of the, I do the finances.
[279:20.65]I'm the idea guy I need to remotely connect to your computer and check the cookbooks okay you called the the the kit books am I pronouncing that wrong we have to connect to your computer and connect to your cookbooks and check what is the problem happening are you in front of a computer right now
[279:44.64]I am, as a matter of fact.
[279:46.92]We were just discussing about... Okay.
[279:50.56]Do you have any... Sorry, go ahead with the computer.
[279:56.87]You have to open a website for me, www.support.me.
[280:01.75]Okay.
[280:05.79]Do I need to do this too, or is this just something that he needs to do?
[280:10.99]I probably own my laptop because I'm the one having the problem with it.
[280:19.06]Yes.
[280:20.08]Do you want to ask him about your issue where, when we were trying to figure out, when we write checks, is there a way to have them automatically get, what were you trying to do with the checks?
[280:32.11]I forgot.
[280:33.92]I wanted to automatically send checks out to the employees that we are trying to do with this startup.
[280:41.03]Can we do anything like that with QuickBooks or no?
[280:45.14]Yes, sir.
[280:46.86]We definitely have to check that with the payroll team.
[280:49.92]And if there would be any way, we will go ahead and get set up for you.
[280:54.64]Yeah, there's technically three employees, me, him, and then I put my dog on there just to... For tax purposes?
[281:01.70]I don't know how... Just for tax purposes, be able to write some of this stuff off.
[281:08.16]He's HR, if you believe it or not.
[281:10.26]No problem.
[281:11.94]We thought that would be cute on the website, too.
[281:13.96]We thought that'd be cute.
[281:17.66]Although, coincidentally, it says support... Yeah, it says support...
[281:38.99]You know, funny enough, the product's not bad, but I will say some of the stuff that you do on the computer.
[281:47.04]Are you a new user to cookbooks?
[281:51.34]How new are we?
[281:52.18]I mean, a couple months.
[281:54.04]It's been a couple of months.
[281:55.78]That's all.
[281:56.40]Yeah.
[282:02.75]Yeah, but we have those three employees.
[282:07.49]We write off the dog food, too, because, you know, that's an expense.
[282:11.81]Yeah, I don't know.
[282:12.39]We were told that we can write off basically anything related to the business.
[282:16.75]So one thing that I did find trouble, though, is there weren't any categories for some of those things in your product.
[282:25.74]So I just kind of had to make them up.
[282:27.96]But anyway, that's a side question.
[282:34.31]It says IN2... May I ask you, have you... Go ahead.
[282:40.15]IN2QB.
[282:41.25]You will get a pop-up on the screen.
[282:42.97]Please press OK on that.
[282:46.21]Okay.
[282:48.88]I'm stalling for a second because it's been a while since I've done this.
[282:53.62]No, I think I... I forgot that he might want to... I don't know why this one's killing me so much.
[283:00.72]I don't know why.
[283:03.20]No, it says I have to buy it Would you say that first press ok on the screen, please You will get a pop-up, please press ok on that we'll see what happens Okay, what what pop-up what pop-up do you mean I
[283:29.81]Sorry.
[283:30.37]Different version or something like that?
[283:31.91]One more pop-up will come on your screen to allow the access.
[283:36.30]And when you press OK, then only I will be able to get connected.
[283:40.12]Okay.
[283:41.08]Let me see where that is.
[283:42.14]Sorry.
[283:42.58]Like I said, I'm the finance guy.
[283:44.58]He's the idea guy.
[283:45.68]Our dog would cover everything else.
[283:48.45]The IT department.
[283:50.15]Okay.
[283:51.62]Yeah, he's actually listed as a lot of things.
[283:53.96]CEO, HR, IT, janitor.
[283:59.67]A lot of money that we get to write off.
[284:01.21]I mean, he is the janitor.
[284:02.39]I mean, in his defense, he is the janitor.
[284:04.59]If you spill something, he'll clean that up right quick.
[284:11.70]Okay.
[284:12.18]Oh, I think I see something.
[284:13.48]Sorry, there was something there saying like Apple running an update, so I had to fix that.
[284:22.21]now you want me to click on okay you're saying sir hello yes please press ok on the screen okay let me click okay you got the right version Ryan you're all set with that I think I think so
[284:57.55]Alright, I got I got you now.
[284:59.28]I got you.
[285:06.06]OK.
[285:12.56]I was trying to intentionally break QuickBooks, but I failed doing that fast.
[285:17.82]Don't know what he's gonna.
[285:18.76]Okay, I can see this I want you to So you're not able to download kickbooks on this computer.
[285:26.81]No, I had it on here Lord your little your phone is like are y'all outside or something?
[285:35.10]I'm on the computer seeing it.
[285:36.72]Can you show me where is the issue?
[285:40.02]Yeah, hold on.
[285:40.82]Let me
[285:43.61]Give me one second.
[285:45.23]Do we need to pay for QuickBooks, or can we just use different emails for the trial over and over again?
[285:50.32]That's a good question.
[285:51.64]We're trying to be frugal.
[285:59.79]We lost the access.
[286:02.37]Sorry, what?
[286:06.46]I lost the remote access.
[286:08.56]Maybe your internet is fluctuating, sir.
[286:11.43]That could be a problem.
[286:14.53]My son was telling me something about that before.
[286:17.61]He's been playing that game.
[286:19.11]What's that game all those kids are playing where you fall over or something?
[286:24.23]Minecraft.
[286:25.60]Okay, now open it to a book, sir.
[286:27.78]It was something about falling.
[286:29.26]What, do they fall down mine shafts?
[286:31.10]That doesn't sound safe.
[286:33.05]You fall in Minecraft.
[286:34.21]I've seen people play it before.
[286:36.21]Okay.
[286:38.37]Anyway, what were you asking me to do, sir?
[286:40.11]Sir, opening a cookbook that I can see, but there's a problem happening.
[286:47.54]Okay.
[286:53.98]This is the... Yeah, this is the problem.
[286:58.06]Yeah, it was working.
[286:59.24]I swear it was working two days ago.
[287:00.60]Okay, I need to...
[287:03.22]let me just check the knowledge base of the cookbook I guess that's what happens when we have to run if we can hold the line for one minute oh okay
[287:21.55]Um, yeah, we could always just ask him questions about our business and stuff too.
[287:26.45]And sometimes they get, um, a little worked up because they just want to find fake.
[287:32.59]Although I just made a problem.
[287:35.37]So what I used to do is I had the free trial and a fake, like, I think I downloaded a sample business thing, like history.
[287:47.64]And then they would tell you that it was corrupted and they would make up all these fake issues.
[287:59.77]Ask them if we can deduct QuickBooks.
[288:03.81]Even if we don't pay for it.
[288:06.91]Now, if we have the trial, can we write off what it would be?
[288:10.28]The going value of QuickBooks?
[288:18.64]I have.
[288:19.62]Have you seen much with the RTX voice stuff?
[288:24.57]No, it's I use it a lot now because I'll turn it off.
[288:29.43]It was trying to cut out the music, but there are microphones sometimes really bad.
[288:35.44]It's like an NVIDIA has this.
[288:38.00]I don't fully understand it, but it's kind of allegedly
[288:43.87]AI-powered noise reduction.
[288:48.49]And I'll show you in a minute, but when they have fans blowing on their phones or whatever it is, and you can't hear a word they're saying, when you turn it on, you can hear them.
[289:04.59]It's pretty wild.
[289:08.63]quickbooks support it's such a weird specific thing to have support for here like quickbooks oh yeah they have them for all kinds of random I I should we should have tried oh I called one but they weren't answering they have things for like tinder and stuff yeah hey we're here we're here thanks for giving me a hold back okay
[289:37.36]okay so we have gone ahead and checked from our end okay your cookbooks is not responding it seems like there is some errors on there and when I'm trying to open the event log of your windows computer and it's not allowing to open that as well
[289:55.61]So do you have the, I need to go ahead and put your IDs and run a scan on your computer to check what is a problem happening with your QuickBooks.
[290:05.84]Okay.
[290:06.38]Yeah, that's fine with me.
[290:08.64]Yeah.
[290:10.30]Okay.
[290:10.58]Is that like a virus scan?
[290:11.56]Can you please press okay on the screen?
[290:15.45]Hey, we were discussing something while you were gone.
[290:18.93]Do you know much about tax write-offs yourself?
[290:22.97]Yeah, we want to ask you a couple of questions.
[290:25.09]I don't know.
[290:25.70]That will be helped by the bookkeeping team.
[290:28.66]Yeah, the bookkeeping team.
[290:29.50]I can transfer the call after this call to them.
[290:31.62]Okay.
[290:33.26]Yeah, we're trying to find out how to have the business have a profit of $1 total.
[290:37.95]Yeah, definitely.
[290:40.43]While we make probably $4 or $5 million each.
[290:46.48]You will be.
[290:47.54]You will make.
[290:49.00]Excellent.
[290:49.30]That's what I like to hear.
[290:50.02]I'm just going ahead and putting my license.
[290:51.84]This guy knows what's up.
[290:53.68]If you want to hear our idea at some point, you let us know, and we can get you in on pretty early.
[291:04.11]Good Lord, what is happening right now?
[291:08.69]I'm the idea guy.
[291:09.93]You want ideas, but don't steal them.
[291:12.61]Yeah, okay, watch this.
[291:14.11]I want you to see this.
[291:14.95]While this scan is going on, I want you to see this.
[291:17.51]Tell me, what is your favorite thing in life, sir?
[291:20.69]Brian, what's your favorite thing?
[291:21.75]Favorite as in hobby?
[291:23.03]Yeah, what's your favorite hobby?
[291:28.70]As in...
[291:35.58]Traveling.
[291:36.74]Now you can watch this in two seconds or five seconds or less.
[291:39.95]He's going to have an idea, a new business idea about traveling.
[291:43.11]And I swear to God, it is going to be one of the best ideas you have ever heard.
[291:47.62]People are people are lining up.
[291:49.42]Do you hear that?
[291:51.31]That's opportunity knocking right now.
[291:54.18]Go ahead.
[291:54.54]Tell me the idea about traveling.
[291:55.92]Go ahead.
[291:56.98]Hear me out here.
[291:58.46]You like to swim.
[291:59.18]You like to travel.
[291:59.86]Imagine a device that's set on your back, sort of like a jet pack.
[292:03.94]You can go in any body of water, and you could just go 40, 50 miles per hour in that water on the surface level.
[292:10.87]You'll get to your destination in probably three or four days.
[292:15.01]You might be asking yourself, is that safe?
[292:19.05]Well, tell them about the safety features.
[292:21.99]Well, there would be probably two or three safety features on the back of the device.
[292:26.85]If it went over 50, 60 miles per hour, the thing would just detach and turn into a lifeboat that you could float on.
[292:34.62]And then you could float to wherever you wanted to go.
[292:38.88]And then inside of that, there would also be a cell phone built into the floating device, which then you could open it up and dial whoever you needed to to come get you.
[292:49.42]Excuse me, sorry.
[292:50.34]That's a very nice idea, sir.
[292:52.69]Now, the problem, if you're thinking that's too slow, if you have second guesses after the safety features have been activated, is there a way to undo it?
[293:03.86]Well, I mean, here's the thing.
[293:07.32]The best part about this idea, here, this one.
[293:10.40]If it fails, y'all can swim.
[293:14.76]You can just swim.
[293:16.08]You'll be alright.
[293:16.74]You can tread water.
[293:18.28]You're your own device.
[293:21.39]Oh, that's good marketing right there.
[293:22.97]You see what I'm talking about, Brian?
[293:24.49]I mean, who wouldn't want to buy that product?
[293:27.41]This guy, I met him off Craigslist.
[293:30.91]That's me.
[293:31.97]I'm that guy.
[293:32.79]That's me.
[293:34.00]I can't believe you're like what a multi-billionaire or something you said like every business idea this guy touches turns to gold apparently well not quite it's a goal of mine it's a personal goal of mine oh
[293:48.91]anyway trying to get to over a thousand first before I get there we're very you're very you're very intelligent so the actual problem happening with the cookbooks run the error uh the uh the scan if you see at the bottom there is some kind of links are gone broken because of some kind of infection on a device maybe virus or something and it has also damaged the company file which you have created for two months
[294:16.88]Oh, Lord.
[294:17.40]That doesn't sound good.
[294:23.04]it says I need to talk to the data service team okay okay thank you okay because we don't have the expertise and the data service team will also while repairing handle your tax issues and the other uh questions you have everything they will handle if you can hold the line for one to two minutes now hear me out on this one what is the problem happening yeah before you go really quick um
[294:50.27]I got an idea for you.
[294:51.51]If you're trying to compile your data, how about this is coming to me.
[294:56.37]You have this idea where all of your data can go up somewhere.
[295:01.62]Up into the sky, I would call it.
[295:03.86]You can all work from your computers from where you are.
[295:06.44]You don't have to contact each other.
[295:08.60]You don't have to get in touch with each other.
[295:10.28]You can all connect to the same file.
[295:12.40]That'd be... What if you could do something to where the files on one computer,
[295:20.50]could be on another computer at the same time.
[295:23.90]Now that's what I'm saying, exactly.
[295:26.14]And you can all access it together without needing to go find and transfer data.
[295:32.86]Is that even possible?
[295:33.86]That sounds ridiculous.
[295:35.26]Is that even, can you do that?
[295:36.68]Anything is possible when you put your mind to it.
[295:38.78]Okay, well, true, true.
[295:40.15]So you're telling me you would take, it'd be like a synchronized swim team.
[295:48.91]Without the jetpacks, but tech like in the sky with computers somewhere.
[295:57.49]Yeah, yeah.
[295:58.09]Like almost like if you look up in the sky, you could see some of the things up there.
[296:03.10]Like rain.
[296:03.52]That you can all connect to.
[296:04.78]Like rain?
[296:05.42]Like the atmosphere.
[296:06.30]Okay.
[296:07.26]It could be called the atmosphere.
[296:09.42]Or call it the stratosphere.
[296:11.98]Call it something like space related or like Jupiter or like.
[296:17.65]It would have to be space-related technologically, I think.
[296:21.34]I don't know.
[296:22.54]Sorry, Brian, sorry.
[296:23.78]This is most of what we do all day long, so don't let us take up your time.
[296:27.04]You go ahead and talk to the data team.
[296:28.78]We'll keep brainstorming.
[296:30.18]And that one was free, by the way.
[296:32.67]That one was free.
[296:34.93]What if we call it the... Just hold the line, sir.
[296:37.87]Atmo... We've got to be careful about the atmosphere part because of the flat earthers.
[296:44.44]But...
[296:49.42]Alright, I muted us.
[296:51.66]Did he say the cloud?
[296:53.36]Yeah.
[296:53.50]He said it, didn't he?
[296:54.34]He was like, that's the cloud.
[296:58.88]Yeah, this is like a very classic tech scam, though.
[297:02.96]This is what I expected the printer guy to do right away.
[297:05.21]Just 11 links broken, 56 data damaged, or 56%.
[297:11.53]He just typed all of that in.
[297:13.55]Like, none of these things...
[297:15.45]I don't even, obviously you just saw my QuickBooks is expired.
[297:19.91]I don't have an account.
[297:21.02]I don't even have, he didn't bother to look up or ask us our business name to like, see if we have a license.
[297:26.88]He's just 56% data damaged.
[297:29.78]Yeah.
[297:30.32]Yeah.
[297:31.40]Just word soup links broken.
[297:38.88]Are you, are you good for, this might be like another five, 10 minutes.
[297:41.98]Are you good for good?
[297:43.76]Yeah.
[297:44.06]Yeah.
[297:44.40]I'm good.
[297:45.02]Cool.
[297:46.28]yeah normally they say something like um yeah we'll get the data team out here to to fix your damaged yeah someone in chat so you're saying 44 is still yeah can we still use that can we maybe come up with an idea how to use that only that 46 what if we just cut the hard drive in half
[298:18.05]What about a word?
[298:19.33]What about a... Okay, get this.
[298:22.21]What about an idea where... You ever have an animal that's, like, sick?
[298:28.10]Or maybe they need to get their nails trimmed, or... You don't know how to help them.
[298:36.08]Now, what about a place where you could go?
[298:39.42]Like a... A building of sorts.
[298:43.61]That has everything.
[298:44.99]It would be like a...
[298:46.95]A place where you take your dog.
[298:50.43]Just describe a hospital.
[298:53.54]Now imagine you get sick and you've got to go see a place that can fix you.
[298:59.06]Go in, maybe take something orally, medicine maybe, a place where you can spend some time that they can take care of you.
[299:06.54]But if while you're there, something happens, and they're like, oh no, we need to run a heart scan, they would have it right there.
[299:14.14]You wouldn't have to go somewhere else.
[299:15.38]It's just a hospital.
[299:17.07]It's just a doctor's office.
[299:18.85]You would have a bed in multiple rooms.
[299:22.63]What an idea.
[299:23.43]A hospital.
[299:25.79]A whole campus, really.
[299:26.93]You could have a campus of medical...
[299:29.89]Yeah, there could be a radiology department, there could be a ward for beds, and if you were sick, you could stay for a little while.
[299:38.43]And now, what shape would the building be, or does that matter?
[299:43.37]Like, is it a typical building?
[299:44.39]Probably a square, probably a square, I would say.
[299:46.97]Okay.
[299:48.99]Circle ain't gonna work with that one.
[299:52.46]I wonder if he's gonna come back, or if he's just never gonna come back.
[300:00.02]You know, I wonder... Go ahead.
[300:02.49]I wonder what... What do you think he's saying right now to whoever is in his vicinity?
[300:07.99]You think they go, hey, I got these two crazy guys on the line and I don't know what to do with them.
[300:14.13]I don't know.
[300:15.67]I'm sure that's happened before.
[300:18.80]Two really intelligent guys.
[300:21.80]Oh, you're so intelligent.
[300:25.86]I could feel his eyes rolling all the way back in his head.
[300:30.77]Someone suffering says, what does 11 links broken even mean?
[300:35.02]That is a good question.
[300:36.78]I don't, I don't know.
[300:39.82]11 links broken.
[300:45.46]Well, we'll give him another minute.
[300:46.74]If he doesn't come back, we'll just, people have a dog as their CEO.
[300:51.26]Nick, can you.
[300:57.23]Hmm.
[300:59.37]Just look us up on your records under CEO.
[301:02.96]It's Mr. Sprinkles.
[301:05.88]Yeah, that's a good dog.
[301:06.96]Mr. Sprinkles is the CEO and the janitor.
[301:17.22]That's Dr. Sprinkles.
[301:20.24]Hello.
[301:25.59]Purposely type slow.
[301:30.75]low why is it green another scammer turned it green the other day and I forgot to change it back now now what if when he comes back you want to be in the middle of an idea argument that could be fine alright um
[301:54.73]Wings aren't going to work.
[301:55.51]I'm telling you, wings will not work.
[301:57.55]Okay, so instead of wings, hear me out on this one.
[302:02.44]Hear me out on this.
[302:03.56]You ever seen them?
[302:04.82]You ever see that show BattleBots?
[302:07.70]I have.
[302:07.98]I've seen it plenty of times.
[302:08.76]Now, what if we put some kind of, like a spinning, what do you call that?
[302:14.70]A gear.
[302:15.16]What if we use gears?
[302:17.62]Axle.
[302:19.46]I don't know what was called an axle.
[302:20.58]I think they were called gears.
[302:23.48]Axle.
[302:25.31]Axle.
[302:27.09]I mean, I do like how that sounds.
[302:28.81]Axle sounds way more technical, I guess.
[302:35.28]I like the idea because then when people are thinking about buying it, you could say now includes an extra axle or an extra gear.
[302:44.66]You could say, I don't know if I agree with that.
[302:47.66]You're getting too far.
[302:48.74]An axle is not going to work.
[302:52.93]You need to have a full on, I'm the idea guy, not you.
[302:57.99]Let's just make that really clear.
[302:58.79]I know, but how do you know?
[302:59.97]Did you just, like, how do you know you're the idea guy?
[303:02.33]I wonder if I'm a little bit of an idea guy.
[303:03.86]I'm like, how do you know I didn't just hit you?
[303:07.26]Because you're the finance guy and I'm the idea guy.
[303:09.52]And I don't want you to embarrass me in front of our new accountant here.
[303:17.97]Hello, are you there?
[303:23.09]he definitely was there for a second I thought he was just I thought he was just gonna do it to get our attention hello hello sir I don't know I don't know if they're all I don't know if they're if they're here or not but listen what if you do um we're talking we're if we do that idea you were talking about before with the jetpack
[303:53.53]I think a jetpack will work.
[303:56.11]Yeah, but didn't Elon try to do something with the jetpack?
[303:59.92]Are you sure?
[304:02.30]Yeah, but that's not a real jetpack.
[304:05.00]True.
[304:05.20]That's a fake jetpack.
[304:08.12]Now, do people's insurance costs go up if they use it, though?
[304:13.58]It's separate insurance.
[304:15.98]It's jetpack-specific insurance.
[304:18.61]Do we sell that, too?
[304:22.60]Oh, my God.
[304:23.76]I know I'm not the idea guy, but I'll tell you what.
[304:26.30]There's a lot of money in insurance.
[304:29.52]What if you could sell the product and the insurance for it?
[304:34.80]Well, you can be the idea guy if you want, but only in small doses.
[304:41.78]Okay.
[304:42.22]Alright.
[304:42.50]Fair enough.
[304:43.76]And seconds at a time.
[304:44.92]How do I send this guy?
[304:47.74]How do I get a hold of this guy?
[304:51.65]Oh, look, my little chat box.
[304:55.09]Hello.
[304:56.14]Hello.
[305:00.50]Oh, that's so funny.
[305:02.52]Oh, he's typing now.
[305:04.04]Brian is typing.
[305:07.40]Sir, I am here.
[305:10.37]Why?
[305:10.63]Why is he not talking?
[305:15.87]He's talking to the data service team.
[305:18.27]can you put them I'm typing too fast on speaker wait or conference comp call
[305:39.03]see sometimes I think this part of it might be just to make it seem legitimate like sir I would discuss every option with your with the data team and unfortunately the best we can do for you we have an you know 800 or whatever it is yeah sir they're saying the damage is quite high he just wrote um let me try to get him back on the phone so yeah
[306:08.88]don't know if you can read it it says there can you take the music off we got an idea for that yeah we had that listen how about rock music yeah definitely when he comes back
[306:38.93]now that's a lot of damage true that's we could we could describe flux tape how much more damage are we done hello is that why he said it's fine now he hung up
[307:09.23]This call is being recorded.
[307:11.00]If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time.
[307:14.82]Please hold while I try to connect you.
[307:22.12]Oh no.
[307:22.70]I think he hung up immediately.
[307:25.44]Maybe he's just... Did you take the music off?
[307:30.24]If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time.
[307:33.92]Please hold while I try to connect you.
[307:36.37]It's like, no, it's a, it's a hold.
[307:38.43]We can't like take the music off.
[307:42.75]Don't call.
[307:43.21]I'm talking to data service.
[307:48.43]I gave a goal in Quick-Fix.
[307:49.77]How may I help you?
[307:52.04]Hey, we were talking to Brian before.
[307:58.98]Should I arrange a call back for you?
[308:01.52]Well, maybe he was talking to the data team.
[308:03.94]Um,
[308:05.80]But maybe, actually, while he's doing that, maybe we can kill, well, they say, well, not kill, just maim two birds with one stone.
[308:12.79]Wait, that's even worse.
[308:14.69]We're trying to get our QuickBooks fixed, but we also have some questions about the product.
[308:22.12]Yeah, we're just trying to get the thing running.
[308:28.13]So should I go ahead and arrange a call back for you from Brian or what do you want me to do here, sir?
[308:34.55]I mean, probably not because he's already talking to the data team.
[308:38.58]We had some questions about the product itself.
[308:41.70]So when we're doing our taxes, do you have any features
[308:45.97]or like an extra plan that we could pay for within QuickBooks that would help us maximize our deductions.
[308:54.25]We already have it set up.
[308:55.45]So we got like our kids and our dog and different people listed as employees.
[309:00.65]So we took out like the college savings plans and all kinds of other stuff.
[309:06.65]But do you have any automatic features?
[309:10.22]Yeah, we have action figures who we have determined to be employees to.
[309:15.28]I got a he-man back here that I have claimed.
[309:18.69]We were told that as long as they have a job, that they technically can be employee.
[309:23.47]So in this case, it's like an emotional support toy or animal.
[309:30.54]We're just trying to maximize our deduction.
[309:34.86]I'm trying to transfer your call to the right department, sir.
[309:37.76]Please hold the line.
[309:39.49]Okay, yeah, if you need to go back to... Okay.
[309:44.01]This call is being recorded.
[309:45.43]I almost told him if you need to go back to bed.
[309:48.35]He was saying too far.
[309:52.21]We have action figures that we have as employees that we just make sure we pay fake money to.
[309:57.99]Can you hear me, sir?
[310:01.05]Hello?
[310:04.68]Yeah, hello?
[310:05.26]Can you hear me?
[310:06.14]Yeah, who's this?
[310:07.08]Is this Brian?
[310:09.57]This is Brian, yeah.
[310:11.13]Oh, Brian, how are you?
[310:14.71]How'd you make out?
[310:15.53]How'd you make out with the data service?
[310:19.69]So the data service team is saying it requires a full repair, your cookbooks and data file both.
[310:26.26]Okay.
[310:27.00]And when the repair happens, then only we can go ahead and get everything in a working way.
[310:32.62]Okay.
[310:33.10]And they are also checked with the billing team.
[310:36.38]billing team is saying the premium support is not activated on your account they have to go ahead and activate that first the premium plan you have not purchased so to purchase that first how much does that cost normally and can we write that off are we going to be able to write that off as a business expense I'm sure we can we better be able to get down for you okay I'm sure we can write it off give me wait a minute
[311:08.06]And now when you, out of curiosity, when you say that we have to do a full repair, I assume you're talking about... I assume you're talking about the 44% that was damaged.
[311:23.49]56.
[311:26.47]Now do we need that?
[311:29.07]56%?
[311:29.46]Yeah, I guess what we're trying to understand, are you repairing the extra 44, are you repairing the 44 that...
[311:40.00]I'm not very good at math.
[311:40.98]I know I'm the numbers guy, but 44% of the data is not damaged.
[311:46.84]So when you say the full repair, are you repairing 100% of the data or 56% of the data?
[311:54.99]We will be repairing the 100% of the data.
[311:57.91]But that doesn't make any sense.
[311:59.73]If only 56% is, can you give us a 44% discount on those prices?
[312:07.31]No, sir.
[312:08.03]The file will get uploaded on the server for a complete repair.
[312:13.16]Yeah, but only 56% of the data is damaged.
[312:15.76]See that?
[312:18.12]This is why he's the numbers guy.
[312:19.40]I'm telling you.
[312:20.16]Yeah, I don't want to be charged full price.
[312:21.81]I don't want to fix 100% of the data.
[312:23.97]I only want to fix 56% of it.
[312:25.37]You see what I'm saying?
[312:29.55]Why can't you just go in and fix those 11 links?
[312:33.62]Or yeah, can we pay per link?
[312:36.76]How much is it?
[312:38.42]Is there a per link price instead of a flat price?
[312:45.59]I'm sorry?
[312:47.85]Everything okay over there?
[312:48.69]It sounds like you're... I'm not getting your point, sir.
[312:55.89]I guess what we're saying is we don't need the weakest link anyway.
[312:59.94]Are there any of those links that we can get rid of?
[313:03.01]Can we just use the 44% of what was there?
[313:05.65]Do we have to repair it, or can we just use it?
[313:09.39]And just take that 56% and get rid of it.
[313:11.29]You probably should anyway.
[313:13.10]You'll be doing us a favor.
[313:17.24]I'm sorry, are you laughing right now or crying?
[313:23.86]I see only one of those options.
[313:25.30]I'm laughing, sir.
[313:28.79]Excuse me.
[313:29.25]What are you responding about this situation right now?
[313:32.11]You got two business guys paying for your product.
[313:34.76]That's not possible.
[313:36.38]We cannot delete 56% of data and give you 44% back.
[313:42.50]But you said right there 56% of the data is damaged.
[313:47.68]I may not be the idea guy, but you might want to look into it.
[313:51.00]You know what?
[313:52.20]I bet.
[313:52.50]Yeah.
[313:52.62]Lay it on them.
[313:55.73]What do you think they should offer?
[313:56.91]Like some kind of different plan?
[313:58.73]I think we could take half of that data.
[314:01.91]56% of that data, I would assume.
[314:06.07]You know, we got the dog as a CEO on there.
[314:08.71]If it went away, that would be fine.
[314:10.79]He hung up, sorry.
[314:11.89]But that 44%.
[314:14.73]I think he's just like, no way, buddy.
[314:16.99]Trying to clean the books for us.
[314:20.37]Trying to get him to delete our bad data that we want deleted.
[314:28.53]He just couldn't handle it.
[314:29.28]I'm just typing on Megalov.
[314:33.10]Did you see the prices, by the way?
[314:34.20]$999 for six months.
[314:34.94]$1,000.
[314:35.20]That's so much money.
[314:35.62]This is ridiculous.
[314:36.06]These guys are crazy.
[314:36.58]I'm not talking to them.
[314:52.73]But yeah, the first time I found out about this particular scam was because someone told me one of their coworkers was in the process of paying for this because their QuickBooks was messed up.
[315:07.32]And it's like a business expense, right?
[315:10.34]So they're probably even just using the company card or whatever.
[315:13.11]They don't really...
[315:14.42]They don't really care as much.
[315:16.04]They just want their QuickBooks to be fixed.
[315:18.62]And yeah, that's how I first heard about it.
[315:21.98]Thankfully, they didn't fall for it.
[315:23.61]But yeah.
[315:28.47]56%.
[315:28.87]Just trying.
[315:30.65]It's so much fun.
