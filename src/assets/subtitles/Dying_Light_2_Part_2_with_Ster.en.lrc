[00:03.39]Hello, hi.
[00:05.29]Hey, hey, hello.
[00:06.67]Hello, Ster.
[00:07.73]How are you?
[00:08.35]Welcome back to the stream.
[00:09.51]We had a stream a couple days ago.
[00:11.95]Hello.
[00:12.93]Hello.
[00:13.83]Hi.
[00:14.21]Wait, hold on.
[00:17.14]Play that again.
[00:17.52]Hello.
[00:19.46]Hello.
[00:20.48]Why do you still have this shit like four years later?
[00:24.18]Because I had no need to replace it.
[00:26.36]Why would you still have a recording of me from like four years ago?
[00:29.65]I it's one of the most valuable things I own alright can I get an invite please actually I gotta launch the game okay so do you want to uh do you want to be the one to tell everybody that what what we did because you sounded so paranoid that I'm surprised you would even say anything has been done at all
[00:53.62]You don't think that when we open up our menus and show our skill points on stream, people are going to be like, what the fuck is going on here?
[00:59.77]You know how you guys, you have the, please do not remove this under federal law things on your mattresses?
[01:07.19]Like, we pulled it off.
[01:09.31]Not only did we, we didn't pull the whole thing off, so there's like still a little bit there, so there's evidence.
[01:13.52]And people can clearly see that we've tampered with the device.
[01:19.28]I'm just saying, we're going to have to address it.
[01:23.79]You don't open up your menu and see that we have like 20 extra skill points to be like, wait, you're in the same zone you were just in.
[01:29.73]No one remembers from last time.
[01:32.03]They will.
[01:33.31]No one watched from beginning to end except for my mom.
[01:39.36]Is your mom still a big fan?
[01:41.24]Yeah, she told me all about she was watching and catching up on the VOD.
[01:44.28]Really?
[01:44.76]Yeah.
[01:46.82]That's so cool.
[01:47.38]Alright, you want to invite me?
[01:51.90]Hold on, I'm continuing.
[01:53.93]Okay, chat.
[01:55.95]This game takes so long to level up.
[01:57.57]We just love, we just, we ripped the mattress tag off and now we have the cool skill points and we can drop kick zombies.
[02:05.25]Send me to jail.
[02:06.83]Send me to jail.
[02:09.25]Fair enough.
[02:11.05]I got to change my stream title.
[02:12.21]Hold on.
[02:12.59]Because I'm not doing GeoGuessr anymore.
[02:14.72]Did you know that GeoGuessr is like an updated thing and now you have to pay for it?
[02:18.58]You don't have to.
[02:19.84]I have never used GeoGuessr.
[02:21.94]What?
[02:22.90]I wouldn't know any of this.
[02:27.03]You've never played GeoGuessr?
[02:29.05]No.
[02:29.95]You should.
[02:30.43]I feel like you'd probably like it.
[02:33.59]What's a good title?
[02:34.71]Literally the next sentence you say will be my title.
[02:38.56]Came in pants, still gaming.
[02:41.83]It's not going to be that.
[02:43.35]It's not anything else.
[02:44.65]Say something normal.
[02:46.31]Something normal.
[02:47.45]Anything else besides what you just said.
[02:48.95]Another sentence, please.
[02:51.77]You're putting me on the spot.
[02:52.81]Why would you fucking say that?
[02:56.82]You were always the title guy.
[03:01.64]I was the title guy?
[03:03.96]You were always like, you had the funniest titles.
[03:05.60]Your titles were always so funny.
[03:07.42]Well, you just denied my first one.
[03:09.22]Because your title that you just gave me is like... I feel like I would get in trouble for writing that in my title.
[03:16.93]Um... You could just write... No, that's lame.
[03:26.90]What was it?
[03:30.04]You'd write Sterma, Perma, and then like six hearts.
[03:37.27]Like a bunch of emojis.
[03:40.25]Uh, okay.
[03:40.87]Sterma?
[03:41.61]Perma?
[03:44.03]Yeah.
[03:44.83]And then hearts?
[03:46.65]Yeah.
[03:49.15]Don't do like the less than threes.
[03:50.65]Like actually go to Google and copy a heart emoji.
[03:52.81]Oh, I am doing.
[03:53.26]No, no, no.
[03:53.74]I don't want to do that shit.
[03:54.94]That's too much work.
[03:56.78]Wait, perma means like permanent, right?
[03:59.02]Yeah.
[03:59.56]Okay, that's not something weird thing that you're like making me write.
[04:02.82]What else would it mean?
[04:03.96]I don't know.
[04:06.32]I don't know.
[04:07.30]The last thing you just told me to do was say that I, like, did something into my fucking pants.
[04:11.54]And I'm not gonna just put whatever the next thing you say with a little bit of scrutiny.
[04:15.16]I want it... I just wanted you to have the greatest clickbait title you could have.
[04:20.58]I wanted you to succeed.
[04:21.58]Alright, can I get an invite?
[04:24.06]Uh, yeah.
[04:27.14]Yeah.
[04:29.38]Okay, I guess we cheated.
[04:30.10]I'm sorry.
[04:30.72]We cheated, and I don't want to get in trouble for it.
[04:33.08]It was his idea.
[04:33.88]It had nothing to do with me.
[04:34.86]I actually fought against it.
[04:41.53]wow uh sterma temp are you in the game yet yeah I just invited you no you didn't uh my whole um the whole world just saw me invite you so oh okay I got it should I do that thing again where I just like no no no no no don't don't don't I got it okay it's your screen I know I'm but when I'm not in the game yet
[05:11.44]The BRB screen is still there because I'm not technically back.
[05:20.66]Okay.
[05:21.52]I've loaded in.
[05:22.12]I am now technically in the game as of right.
[05:25.20]I'd say right now.
[05:29.47]Have you ever had a naked on stream like dream?
[05:32.37]A naked on stream dream.
[05:34.61]Like you had a dream that like, oh my God, I'm naked.
[05:36.91]Connection to the game.
[05:37.47]Your session could not be established.
[05:38.81]You have to invite me again.
[05:40.72]uh no I've never had a naked in I just have a lot of school dreams like I'm back in school I had one last night it's always just like it's school again really how like how much school does one person need alright I'm in is that you where are you box let me get my screen correct here
[06:08.94]Okay, should be dying light too.
[06:10.46]There it is.
[06:11.30]I mean, like, I have nothing to hide.
[06:16.77]Like, if I walked on camera nude.
[06:20.65]If you walked on camera nude, then you don't think that you would, like, get in trouble for that.
[06:24.87]I think I would get banned for three days, but I think on all the websites where they, like, post nude people.
[06:31.12]Like, uh, the drama streamer stuff.
[06:33.38]I think that would probably be the best thing that could happen to me.
[06:35.59]Alright, so where are we going?
[06:37.17]The last thing we did, we unlocked, like, the actual video game last time, right?
[06:41.55]Um... Yes, I think.
[06:43.87]Maybe.
[06:45.48]Yeah.
[06:45.86]And we also unlocked all these moves, if you guys don't remember.
[06:48.04]And we got, like, 50,000 points of experience.
[06:52.80]Um, if you don't remember the last mission we completed.
[06:55.89]yeah they just like they said wow you unlock the new area you're also going to need all of these experience points for it alright let's go find okay we gotta go we gotta go to Barney facecam no I don't I don't want facecam I have a headache it wasn't face game on last time it has to be consistent
[07:19.01]Why do you have a headache?
[07:21.01]I don't know, because I had a dream.
[07:23.31]Every time I have a dream that I remember, I have a headache.
[07:25.59]Does that work for you too?
[07:26.87]Well, no.
[07:29.99]Really?
[07:31.79]That's not at all related to the content of the dream being you nude on stream.
[07:36.00]No, no.
[07:36.90]Every time I have a dream that I can remember, I have a migraine for the whole day.
[07:42.16]It's been like that since I was like 16, 15.
[07:43.44]I don't know why.
[07:48.85]Yeah, I think your your brains broke.
[07:51.37]I mean, I've had an MRI of my brain like twice and they just say it looks OK.
[07:55.32]There's a quest giver here inside.
[07:59.80]No, like like like this Bush is a quest giver apparently.
[08:05.51]I think they're in the building.
[08:08.01]No, we're we're not doing that.
[08:09.41]By the way, we're going to the yellow.
[08:13.29]We're going to find Barney's house.
[08:15.45]Whether you like it or not.
[08:16.67]Because Barney's going to show us to the new area.
[08:18.45]And he's going to give us like... What was that?
[08:20.47]There's a flare.
[08:21.51]We're going to the flare.
[08:22.15]You see the flare?
[08:23.25]Oh, yo.
[08:24.55]Let's go.
[08:24.83]We got to go.
[08:29.57]Somebody needs help over here.
[08:34.21]Help him.
[08:34.67]Get him up.
[08:37.53]Help him.
[08:42.20]Alright.
[08:42.50]200 experience.
[08:44.02]That's pretty good.
[08:44.62]That's pretty good.
[08:47.10]You know, do you understand that for the rest of the whole game, we're not going to be able to put points in because of the fact that we cheated?
[08:53.88]Yeah, I know.
[08:54.58]EXP means nothing right now because we're like 20 hours ahead in experience points.
[09:00.07]Yeah, but they gatekeep being able to do a power attack.
[09:03.51]A power attack is the third tier of ability where you just hold down your mouse button.
[09:08.25]I will agree that having that hidden... Where's the flare?
[09:13.48]This was the guy shooting it.
[09:15.06]It was?
[09:16.26]Yeah.
[09:19.20]You just ruined the Dying Light 2 experience.
[09:22.84]Well, I mean, that's not necessarily true because this is the last time either one of us is going to play this game.
[09:28.17]I kind of have a knack for ruining games for Jerma.
[09:34.27]So, I mean, I'm... We've been playing for... Just about, what, like 8 to 10 hours?
[09:39.93]Including the single player stuff we had to do?
[09:42.29]Yeah.
[09:43.05]I'm completely happy with getting to this point.
[09:45.80]We're at like 13, 15 hours of gameplay.
[09:48.18]I'm alright.
[09:48.76]That's okay.
[09:49.04]When was the last time you finished a single player game that wasn't a FromSoftware game?
[09:55.13]finished a game so the place should be empty now but I don't know when they'll be back that's a good question literally yesterday oh oh what I got cooped I got cooped bad why is my immunity critical because we walk through the group you're gonna have to mushroom what how do I do that what is this one
[10:24.35]uh press two and you switch through your things and you got your mushrooms your right right your power-ups or your juicers I got it dad okay thank you uh where's oh Barney's up in this building up here let's get up there they're gonna say they do a lot of talking in this game about how night time is super dangerous
[10:49.52]I like, you know, I kind of like this, like, do, like, more than one thing on stream thing.
[10:53.70]That's kind of cool.
[10:54.28]I like that.
[10:55.62]Have you never done more than one thing before?
[10:57.32]I mean, not really.
[10:58.36]Maybe, like, once or twice.
[11:05.38]It's like, instead of just one thing for, like, five to seven hours, it's, like, two things for, like, two to three hours each.
[11:11.64]I feel like you would have realized that earlier, considering you're, like, super ADD.
[11:18.11]Excuse me?
[11:18.53]It's not a bad thing.
[11:21.29]Hold on.
[11:21.87]Excuse me?
[11:22.93]I'm lockpicking.
[11:24.25]What?
[11:25.51]Okay.
[11:26.89]I'm just gonna, like, pretend like you didn't say that.
[11:29.23]Like, what the fuck?
[11:31.13]Okay, dude.
[11:31.82]Um... Oh!
[11:40.42]You already took this?
[11:42.21]Yeah, this was the same mission from before.
[11:43.97]Oh, right.
[11:45.03]Yeah, with the things and the stuff.
[11:46.27]And there was people here.
[11:47.11]And where's Barry?
[11:48.47]Barry is in here somewhere.
[11:50.09]Barry Season 3.
[11:54.64]Over here.
[11:56.78]Like you said, Barry.
[11:58.36]It's just about us being friends.
[12:01.30]It's just like you said.
[12:04.91]I don't think there's anything I need to do about that, Barry.
[12:08.09]It's like you said.
[12:10.63]How come you're not laughing at that I'm doing the guy from Barry?
[12:13.73]Um... Thank you.
[12:18.25]That wasn't Mr. Satan.
[12:25.93]I don't remember that part, and I feel like of all the things from Barry... You don't remember that part from Barry?
[12:30.64]That is like the best character in Barry.
[12:34.32]Which one?
[12:34.72]It's been so long.
[12:37.34]Like four years?
[12:39.73]That actually has been a long time.
[12:40.79]Okay, search Barney's hideout for evidence.
[12:47.20]Everyone's always hiding stuff behind these really heavy planks.
[12:52.94]Re-voices Andy.
[12:57.36]There's no evidence.
[12:58.32]There's something right here.
[12:59.08]Oh, there is something right here.
[13:04.29]I wonder what this is.
[13:06.09]What's that?
[13:07.27]I found the tattoo they cut out of Lucas.
[13:10.12]They cut his tattoo?
[13:11.74]Off?
[13:12.44]I'm gonna throw up.
[13:17.98]A little piece of Lucas to remember him by, you sicko.
[13:22.10]Fuck you.
[13:23.12]Nice try.
[13:24.12]But that ain't mine.
[13:24.90]That ain't mine?
[13:25.72]Yeah, it's Lucas's, you shitter.
[13:27.70]Wait, didn't he just swing?
[13:28.54]Yeah.
[13:29.70]Where are you?
[13:32.06]I'm right here.
[13:40.28]Alright, let's both hit him with a charged up swing at the same time.
[13:44.04]One, two, three.
[13:49.83]Did you even hit him?
[13:52.99]Did we kill him?
[13:54.55]Wait, did you just stomp his head?
[13:55.99]Yeah, I jumped on his head.
[13:57.63]She's next.
[14:09.14]Pilgrim is framing us.
[14:10.48]We still have level one weapons?
[14:12.30]Yeah.
[14:13.36]I found the proof.
[14:14.66]Proof?
[14:16.05]You cut the tattoo from Commander Lucas's arm.
[14:18.01]Oh, shit.
[14:18.57]It was her.
[14:18.95]After his death.
[14:20.59]You're out of your mind.
[14:21.73]Okay, now we got to fight him.
[14:23.29]Maybe you didn't.
[14:25.52]I'll kill you.
[14:26.68]I'm going.
[14:27.54]Aiden.
[14:29.92]Where did this tattoo come from?
[14:31.12]We need to know.
[14:31.56]Where did this piece of skin come from, Sophie?
[14:34.07]Who's planting skin in your house?
[14:37.50]I'm going to cut somebody's skin off and plant it in their drywall.
[14:44.66]And when somebody finds it, they'll think it was them.
[14:47.86]How do you come in here and demo this house and put that in there?
[14:52.10]And then hide it with a plywood plank.
[14:58.65]I'm gonna say, okay, if I came home, and I went up into my bedroom, and there was a huge piece of fucking plywood against the wall, would you not?
[15:08.66]It must always be there.
[15:10.44]You'd be like, why is that there?
[15:19.86]Well, we didn't have to fight them.
[15:22.24]Lame.
[15:22.88]Where'd they go?
[15:24.09]This is the apocalypse, Jerma.
[15:25.39]Nobody's demoing OMEGALUL.
[15:30.56]But you wouldn't notice that this was here?
[15:34.96]This is something you don't notice because there's a piece of huge piece of plywood in front of it.
[15:40.27]That's what I'm saying.
[15:40.93]It must always be that way.
[15:42.53]Why are you expecting like they live in this luxury home in the apocalypse?
[15:45.81]They need to get permits.
[15:46.59]They don't have holes in their wall.
[15:49.75]Alright, what's our quest?
[15:51.21]We gotta go get this guy a permit.
[15:53.00]Very important question for you, Ster.
[15:55.86]3, 2, 1.
[15:56.00]Do you call them quests or missions?
[15:57.84]Go.
[15:58.92]Quests.
[16:00.04]Loser.
[16:01.20]Why am I a loser?
[16:02.24]It's a mission.
[16:04.02]It's a very important quest for a group of adventurers.
[16:05.60]This isn't magical fucking 1400s Europe.
[16:12.47]Well, I think this game calls them quests, and based on what you said in the previous session, of them being called community gift subs, I think you have to concede to what the game is describing them as.
[16:21.03]I'm having a little bit of trouble here trying to see.
[16:22.65]Do you see any elves anywhere?
[16:26.20]Not seeing any elves, though.
[16:29.13]I'm definitely seeing some more to how chivalry style medieval gameplay We don't have a quest fuck That was really bad that was so bad that it was made up for a joke, but it wasn't Wow Unbelievable I'm gonna take that loss.
[16:53.32]That's a big problem.
[16:54.44]Oh
[16:56.83]I can't fucking believe that just happened.
[16:58.79]That had to be fake.
[17:01.97]Hold on.
[17:02.29]I'm looking up the missions.
[17:10.34]Cancel the throw.
[17:12.94]What does it want from me?
[17:15.56]It's a massive L. It really was.
[17:17.80]Jesus.
[17:23.08]I have a headache.
[17:23.76]Alright.
[17:24.22]It's like hard to concentrate.
[17:26.05]Our quest is wait for Sophie's call.
[17:29.05]So we just have to walk around.
[17:30.55]Yeah, I think we just like, let's just go like hop around.
[17:38.62]I'm following you.
[17:39.28]You're the one that knows where you're going.
[17:43.18]I don't know where Sophie's call is.
[17:44.78]I think it's a payphone.
[17:56.57]Yeah, we do have level one weapons, because look at how long it takes to hurt anybody.
[18:00.87]Yeah, we do.
[18:02.33]How do you level up your weapon?
[18:04.69]Well, we're still fighting level two enemies.
[18:06.84]Like, some of my weapons are level two.
[18:08.40]Oh my, what happened?
[18:13.78]How'd you do that?
[18:14.20]Drop kick.
[18:15.44]You jump and you mash E. Or kick.
[18:18.57]Okay, kick F. Oh, holy shit, that's crazy.
[18:29.53]Alright, let's keep going.
[18:30.61]Wait for that call.
[18:36.99]Watch out.
[18:37.43]There's a boomer over there.
[18:39.78]Boomer?
[18:44.38]L plus ratio plus headache plus you fell off.
[18:48.36]Watch out, boomer.
[19:01.67]Watch out.
[19:03.17]We got Zeds coming.
[19:05.41]Uh, I'm gonna sneeze.
[19:06.57]And I can't mute because it's too far.
[19:08.71]What do I do?
[19:09.03]Give me a word to say.
[19:11.27]I come in pants.
[19:12.25]No!
[19:12.67]I'm not saying that.
[19:14.79]What the fuck?
[19:15.81]Oh, the chase is on.
[19:22.13]I jumped off a zombie's head and went... You go like three stories.
[19:28.65]Do you see this?
[19:29.79]What?
[19:30.70]I'm trying to run a look at this zombie parkour.
[19:32.34]Holy shit.
[19:35.64]How did you do that?
[19:36.36]I don't know.
[19:38.54]Oh, my immunity is in critical condition.
[19:49.47]We're at chase level one, dude.
[19:52.09]No.
[19:59.44]No.
[20:02.10]I'm going for this UV light.
[20:03.32]Is that my foot?
[20:03.68]It's the only safe place for Miles.
[20:13.54]They can't get me here.
[20:18.32]And the tomatoes.
[20:19.06]Do you think zombies would eat these tomatoes?
[20:25.53]Yeah, see, this is like, this is more what I was talking about.
[20:28.63]Instead of having like one tomato vine, you got like ten.
[20:35.81]Is he gonna... Yeah, so I think they put the UV lights here because the zombies would be taking potatoes.
[20:48.69]Put the tomatoes.
[20:49.53]He said potatoes!
[20:50.86]Ha ha, he said potatoes!
[20:56.57]Um, can this lady call us?
[20:59.67]No.
[21:00.26]Oh, wait.
[21:00.58]I think we have an actual marker now.
[21:03.98]Oh, we do.
[21:05.68]Yeah, we gotta go to the place.
[21:07.94]He's bringing out the shpee voice.
[21:16.33]But, we didn't get a call, though.
[21:20.71]Is that a problem?
[21:21.31]I thought we were waiting for a call.
[21:27.06]Can you just go to the fucking quest diamond?
[21:33.05]Are you going to play Elden Ring?
[21:35.55]Uh, yeah.
[21:37.37]Are you going to beat Elden Ring like you didn't beat Sekiro?
[21:42.35]I mean, I saw the last boss in Sekiro.
[21:44.57]That's pretty much beating it.
[21:46.47]That's true.
[21:48.19]And like, what else is there?
[21:53.34]Do you remember you and me, both of us, desperately co-oping Orphan?
[22:00.68]And we just couldn't do it.
[22:01.94]I do, actually.
[22:03.68]And we both just gave up.
[22:06.52]We did.
[22:08.25]We co-oped Orphan and gave up.
[22:10.13]And I mean, this wasn't we didn't just try for like 10 minutes.
[22:13.59]This was like two plus hours of us just co-oping Orphan and not being able to do it.
[22:19.63]And I think we both said the same thing that you just said.
[22:21.59]Which was... Well, I mean... Like, we pretty much... We got him down to like 30%.
[22:26.29]We saw it.
[22:26.67]I mean, we pretty much beat it.
[22:27.79]We like... We know there's nothing else after him.
[22:31.03]Where are we going?
[22:32.49]We got... Oh.
[22:38.90]I think you're going the wrong way.
[22:40.24]What do you mean I'm going the wrong way?
[22:42.22]I'm going the right way.
[22:45.92]I'm going towards the diamond.
[22:49.63]I'm running across the rooftops.
[22:50.91]I'm using my injected hyper serum to be able to do incredible jumps.
[22:56.15]How do you do that?
[22:56.63]Fantastic maneuvers.
[22:58.63]I don't know.
[22:59.15]We just cheated and I didn't even know what we did.
[23:00.91]So, like, how do you do that move?
[23:03.29]I had it before we'd cheat it.
[23:04.79]Where you press space to climb over something and as you're doing it, you press kick.
[23:09.79]And then you won't use... Look.
[23:11.37]Look at me.
[23:12.45]Look at me.
[23:14.09]Look at me.
[23:14.95]Behind you.
[23:15.65]Look.
[23:16.68]Practice.
[23:19.93]Okay, so is that F?
[23:21.83]You press your jump button to go over the thing and then your kick button as you're doing it.
[23:26.01]Oh my god.
[23:27.67]Then you go to space.
[23:29.01]Oh, I got a new skill point.
[23:30.79]Oh, I bet you cheated for that one too.
[23:33.13]Alright, I'm just going to put it in here.
[23:38.04]Alright, here we are.
[23:54.69]Who am I playing with?
[23:56.29]This is Stirr.
[23:56.97]twitch.tv/Stirr.
[24:00.11]S-T-E-R.
[24:01.52]twitch.tv/Stirr.
[24:06.04]YouTube.com slash Stirr.
[24:09.38]Are we going to play Borderlands 2?
[24:12.04]What?
[24:12.22]I asked if we were going to play Borderlands 2.
[24:14.79]Did they ask you that like a year and a half ago and you just replied now?
[24:25.49]This thing is insane.
[24:26.85]73 damage.
[24:31.27]This guy's got level 6 weapons.
[24:34.52]Probably because we're leveled up.
[24:36.48]Probably because... Yeah, don't buy these.
[24:40.14]Don't buy them?
[24:40.96]I already did.
[24:41.36]Yeah, don't buy these.
[24:43.76]Oh, well.
[24:44.40]Okay, someone's cheating.
[24:50.53]I need all the players up here.
[24:53.38]Hey, Ster, who are you playing with?
[24:54.64]Oh, this is Jerma985, the guy that used to do Little Gems.
[25:00.50]Yeah, that's me.
[25:06.94]Nobody gets that reference, but the people that do really thought that was funny.
[25:10.73]Because it was.
[25:26.24]Remote C4.
[25:27.06]Let's go blow someone up.
[25:37.58]Okay.
[25:40.86]I think we just got a mission.
[25:42.46]I think we do have a mission, yeah.
[25:47.04]Remote decoy.
[25:48.31]No, I thought that was C4.
[25:50.91]I need more scraps because I want to make more molotovs.
[25:58.52]Okay, well this guy wants to talk to us.
[26:04.75]Is this the guy from the servers?
[26:08.65]What?
[26:09.03]They're making fun of me.
[26:13.35]Oh, okay.
[26:13.65]Mine shot is too.
[26:14.21]Very mean.
[26:14.41]Okay, let's do it.
[26:16.21]Okay.
[26:32.68]Alright, where's my new weapon?
[26:35.56]This thing here, okay.
[26:37.66]Go to the water tower for the explosives.
[26:41.36]Oh, can I tell you that I was laughing at The Sopranos punch the propane tank thing the rest of the night.
[26:51.77]Even until like a day ago.
[26:54.85]I thought that was the funniest goddamn thing.
[26:58.86]I'm surprised that was the thing.
[27:01.74]It was just so perfect.
[27:03.28]It was so stupid.
[27:07.36]That's the other way.
[27:13.00]You started a chase, man.
[27:24.11]How do you get to chase level four?
[27:26.47]What's that mean?
[27:29.02]I mean, do you want to try?
[27:30.62]No, I don't.
[27:31.20]I think we just need... Okay.
[27:33.46]He doesn't actually care.
[27:34.42]It probably just intensifies how many zombies are fighting you.
[27:41.78]I feel like Dying Light 1... Here's my review.
[27:44.43]I'm 1,000 experience points in.
[27:46.87]You are?
[27:47.31]Okay.
[27:48.05]I am.
[27:48.27]I feel like Dying Light 1 was a better game.
[27:50.57]Oh my goodness.
[27:51.47]Okay.
[27:51.87]In almost every way other than graphical fidelity.
[27:56.17]Okay.
[27:56.85]Okay.
[27:59.87]I'm ready to make that assertion.
[28:01.90]Okay, so you think Dying Light 1 was a better game?
[28:04.06]Is there any specific reason as to why you feel that way?
[28:08.14]I feel like I'm not threatened at all by these nighttime chases.
[28:11.39]It's actually really fucking bright out the whole nighttime.
[28:13.87]The zombies...
[28:15.08]It feels like there's a lot less of them. Like before when you'd throw firecrackers in the street it was like the entire street was full of them.
[28:22.08]And they felt a little bit more- you know a little bit more dynamic, a little bit more cream cheesy, a little bit more um- a little bit more squishy.
[28:27.08]The propane tanks feel like they just- they blow up and like it's a one foot square in this.
[28:32.08]I don't just just everything's a little bit- a little bit diminished.
[28:35.08]This chase level one like I'm not- don't you remember like hiding in the dark and being scared of zombies?
[28:44.68]I'm muted, aren't I?
[28:45.72]No, you're not.
[28:46.26]I just remember hiding in the dark.
[28:48.31]Hiding in the dark.
[28:52.95]Yeah.
[28:53.45]I think Dying Light 1.
[28:54.83]Where are the weird super mutant people?
[28:56.69]Also, it had guns.
[28:57.85]I miss guns.
[28:58.55]I'm going to say it.
[28:59.51]Where are the guns?
[29:01.11]Were there guns in Dying Light 1?
[29:03.04]Yeah.
[29:03.88]That's why I wanted to get in the police trunks because sometimes they'd have handguns in them.
[29:11.16]Yeah, I don't remember there being guns.
[29:14.28]There were.
[29:18.26]It was a Dying Light 1.
[29:21.28]Yes.
[29:21.56]I mean, there was also cars in the DLC we never played.
[29:26.08]Yeah, but that's... I don't think that's a fair assumption there because... Well, you know what?
[29:31.98]Actually, I played Dying Light like a year ago, I think.
[29:35.56]I don't know why, but I returned to it randomly and played it for like a day and had some mods on it.
[29:41.48]And... Yeah.
[29:45.88]Still overall, good game, but like, it feels like... I don't know.
[29:49.78]I wonder what's gonna... Okay, when do you think we're gonna see... Like, innovation in the, like, video game, like, AAA world?
[29:57.35]Because I feel like we've been in this, kind of like... Quest marker over somebody's head.
[30:04.29]And, like, pick stuff up, scavenge, and craft in the crafting menu.
[30:07.93]I feel like we've been playing, like, the same Far Cry game for the last, like, ten years.
[30:11.84]They have been making the same Far Cry game.
[30:14.92]So what, what, like, is this gonna, do we just keep doing this?
[30:19.70]Yeah, why not?
[30:22.16]It's not a problem, right?
[30:23.44]Like, it's a... Until, until, like, a modder invents auto chess, then every company tries to make auto chess.
[30:30.02]Like, you're...
[30:35.14]It's kind of weird because, like Fallout, right?
[30:38.76]Fallout was the... Oh, I can pick up plates.
[30:42.75]That's kind of interesting.
[30:43.73]I can pick up, like, cigarettes on the ground and plates and stuff.
[30:47.56]And then every company decided that that was, like, not cool anymore.
[30:51.02]So instead of picking up, like, plates, it's, like, just pick up, like, Medpack Craftable Kit 1.
[30:55.92]And Medpack Craftable Kit 2.
[30:59.82]Scrap metal.
[31:01.14]Like, it's not like I can break the plates down and just... They kind of, like, oversimplified it in a way.
[31:06.20]Yeah, can you look up?
[31:07.66]Oh my god!
[31:11.86]Oh my god!
[31:14.05]What the f- Perfect!
[31:15.77]Right up the butt!
[31:22.64]That's how I want to go.
[31:25.88]Shoot the plates.
[31:27.33]I don't know.
[31:28.01]I feel like we... A lot of people have been doing this, apparently.
[31:33.71]Wait, this is... Oh, my God.
[31:37.77]It's just the same tuber joke over and over again.
[31:40.31]There's casualties everywhere.
[31:41.65]Look at all these YouTubers.
[31:47.26]You scared the shit out of me I Guess if you would like tabbed out, and you just hear me go.
[31:52.85]Oh my god.
[31:53.99]Oh my god Like somebody's like I just got like strangled oh
[31:59.79]somebody just like attacked me in my room hey hey you remember dying light here's the real comparison they even do this in the tutorial where you like walk through the subway and it's like on the subway in the dark there's like a whole bunch of them I remember there being so many zombies you like couldn't move if you got off the top of a truck it was like you were surrounded by six layers of dudes and now it's like uh there's like five you know there's a few guys in here
[32:27.11]But is it, okay, is it just easier to kind of develop a game like that?
[32:31.48]That's just, hey, there's, we have like these few, these like five or six like crafting items to make stuff.
[32:38.69]And then there's like all these markers that are in the game for you to go like get experience points to touch them.
[32:45.61]Yeah.
[32:48.05]But here's the other question, right?
[32:49.53]Let's be fair.
[32:50.71]Let's be fair.
[32:52.35]To be fair.
[32:53.97]What else?
[32:55.15]What's the next step, right?
[32:56.90]Like, how do you make a video game like this better?
[33:00.48]What do you do?
[33:02.50]Like, oh, we have these monsters, zombies, and there's a system, and there's like a city street, and there's cars, and... What's there left to do?
[33:09.56]That's in the details.
[33:15.08]Um, do you see that video?
[33:19.25]The Tropicat man always does like comparison videos and did one for Left 4 Dead versus Back 4 Blood.
[33:27.18]Yeah.
[33:28.58]Yeah.
[33:29.00]It's the little things.
[33:30.25]So I don't think it's we need more stuff.
[33:32.95]We need just more passion, god damn it.
[33:36.63]No, I think... I've always said this.
[33:39.95]That after Half-Life 1, everyone should have collectively said, this is so realistic.
[33:44.45]These graphics, I can see Gordon Freeman.
[33:47.64]And they should have just stopped improving graphics.
[33:52.08]But at the same time though, right?
[33:53.56]Think about this.
[33:56.18]Like Goldeneye...
[33:58.10]Do you really need more than, like, one square for a person's face?
[34:01.59]Let's be realistic.
[34:02.43]Not really, I guess.
[34:03.73]No.
[34:07.15]But there's a lot of indie companies and indie devs that are doing exactly that, and they're doing just fine, right?
[34:13.41]Yeah.
[34:14.23]I mean, have you played a lot of Risk Marine 2?
[34:16.93]I have.
[34:17.88]I mean, I played it a long time ago, but it's still good.
[34:22.20]Okay, let's be honest.
[34:24.50]Give... Negative, negative, negative.
[34:27.24]Everything's negative.
[34:29.62]Like, this stuff here, like, oh, prevent infection, like, this, like, artwork, and, like, crafting, like, a scene, and this, like, building, right?
[34:37.54]The wanted part, like, this is, somebody put a lot of time into this, and this is actually, like, a very interesting, like, piece of architecture and stuff.
[34:45.53]Like, the pieces by themselves are actually really, really interesting.
[34:50.43]Yeah.
[34:50.87]It's almost like when they all come together, and, like, the game is turned on.
[34:56.32]It's like you have to sacrifice a lot for all of those pieces to look that good.
[35:02.17]Yeah.
[35:05.30]You got to put a little budget in that.
[35:06.64]And why does it matter when your game is sold based on how it looks in a commercial rather than how it plays?
[35:12.59]Because once they're playing it, they already bought it.
[35:15.29]But also, too, every game does not need to be... I mean, look, some people just kind of want to jump in a game and run around and collect stuff and kill zombies.
[35:25.52]Is that a problem?
[35:26.04]I don't think so.
[35:26.38]I'm saying for me, Dying Light, here's the analysis.
[35:29.00]Dying Light 1 for me was like a 9 out of 10 game.
[35:31.24]I really enjoyed it.
[35:32.06]Yeah.
[35:32.54]it was a little bit flawed you know can't give it the 10 and you know I'm not going crazy it's no Bloodborne out here this game I'll knock like two points off it's a seven it's a totally like yeah good game yeah I mean I don't know we're still playing because it's tough because uh wait are we supposed to kill these people apparently
[36:01.95]Why am I sliding down here?
[36:09.68]I don't know.
[36:11.28]It feels like we've been in the same video game since like 2014.
[36:14.89]2013.
[36:15.27]Okay, if you were to take a screenshot right now.
[36:22.90]I wonder if somebody would, like, do an experiment like this.
[36:24.62]Like, get rid of the HUD.
[36:26.10]And just take a screenshot and, like, a ton of games that have come out that are open world games like this.
[36:30.71]And guess the date?
[36:31.77]See if somebody can guess the game.
[36:33.29]Oh.
[36:34.73]Or guess the date, yeah.
[36:37.68]Depends how generic of a scenery it is with trees and whatnot.
[36:40.90]Yeah.
[36:46.72]I would actually have a lot of trouble.
[36:48.52]Can we get to fucking Zone 2?
[36:50.94]No, this is the podcast.
[36:52.24]This is the... The Stern Jerma talking about games.
[36:56.52]Well, to talk about the game, I want to, like, see Area 2, because the tutorial area where you start in the mountains was, like, ridiculously beautiful.
[37:03.45]If you're talking about take a screenshot of this and see where it's from.
[37:06.09]Like, is this Spider-Man?
[37:10.63]I hope I can grab that.
[37:13.39]Am I Spider-Man?
[37:18.16]Open world games are overdone.
[37:19.30]I feel like people are afraid to make something that's not open world.
[37:25.74]Because it's not enough and people expect it to be like a GTA 5 level map.
[37:31.93]You know what you're experiencing is...
[37:35.86]Um the games that are formulaic are the ones that are marketed and you see them more often, because they are built to be financial successes so they get marketed super hard.
[37:46.00]And the ones that are a little bit more experimental don't have a budget for that kind of thing and they don't know how to market it.
[37:51.00]So you're like oh all these games don't exist, but you're just not seeing them as much.
[37:55.00]Interesting take. Interesting take.
[37:57.00]That's uh- that's a little bit of my take.
[37:58.00]Very interesting take here.
[38:01.00]I killed them.
[38:12.91]Can we open this door?
[38:13.65]They're still there.
[38:16.63]And another thing that makes a problem is... I mean, I feel like this is kind of shitty to say, but I'm gonna say it.
[38:19.83]Oh, shit.
[38:20.07]I feel like a lot of newer games in the last five to ten years...
[38:41.74]What happened?
[38:44.34]What happened?
[38:45.18]Whoa!
[38:50.29]Use the medicine.
[38:50.99]Use the medicine.
[38:51.61]Why can't I open this?
[38:52.31]It's made out of straw.
[38:53.31]Alright, how do I throw a grenade?
[39:00.79]I really mean to say this, but you were going to say what?
[39:02.86]Okay, what I was going to say is...
[39:05.57]I feel like games nowadays don't want you to play the game for more than five minutes before they start talking to you.
[39:14.16]I think, you know what?
[39:15.92]Like, Dark Souls.
[39:17.34]Nowadays?
[39:18.50]Well, no, just, like, I mean, the last, like, ten years, like, recently.
[39:22.24]Like, I think people love Dark Souls because the game doesn't, like, talk to you every fucking five minutes.
[39:27.46]Yeah.
[39:28.92]New AAA games the last five, ten years, it's like, go do this, and now let's talk about it for, like, an hour.
[39:34.14]I kind of just want to play the game, right?
[39:36.54]Like, I just want to play it.
[39:37.16]I like playing games.
[39:38.30]And, like, story, and... Like, we've got to have, like, an elaborate story of a guy trying to find his daughter.
[39:43.28]It's like, do we really need to have all that?
[39:45.72]Like, can't I just play the game?
[39:49.22]No.
[39:52.49]I feel like this is all stuff I said to you, like, eight years ago, and you're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:57.09]Oh, you just want to, like, skip this, don't you?
[40:00.87]No, I... Okay, go watch Dying Light 1.
[40:04.18]right there is a part of that game where we are skipping every single cutscene and going skip skip skip skip yeah so I was on board I was on board okay well this is this is how did you feel about the new doom I didn't I didn't play it I don't think these references did you get one before that I played 2016.
[40:27.03]But yeah, OK, so I'm going to start here.
[40:29.49]Everyone really liked that game because it starts the game and it makes the joke of like you talking to the intercom and you're just like, no, I'm doing guy.
[40:35.12]Fuck this.
[40:35.82]And then you go play the game, right?
[40:37.74]And everyone's like, oh, dude, it's just like, you know, action.
[40:39.58]We like playing this game and it's a really fun game.
[40:41.36]And we weren't like bogged down by story and like they do have the intercom guy come in, but it doesn't really interrupt the pace of the game.
[40:48.41]DOOM Eternal starts with a fucking cutscene of characters you have no idea who they are and all this weird shit and it keeps slowing you down and giving you all these bizarro cutscenes.
[40:55.85]And it's like they- they did it right and I'm curious what made them go the complete opposite direction on the next game.
[41:06.24]Do game companies do focus groups and stuff and ask people like how they feel about things now?
[41:10.32]Or did that happen now?
[41:11.68]Or I wonder if there's like focus groups that are like... You know what I really want to know?
[41:16.22]What happened to this guy's daughter?
[41:21.24]Okay, imagine.
[41:22.06]Imagine this.
[41:22.52]You're in a focus group.
[41:24.22]They're asking you, like, oh, what's your opinion on how to improve this?
[41:26.66]But you enjoyed the thing, but they really, really want to know how to improve it.
[41:31.02]Do you just make up, like, oh, I mean, I guess I, like, don't know his motivation.
[41:34.60]I mean, I guess, like, if there was, you know, like, I don't understand why I was there.
[41:38.25]And then they get that feedback, and they're like, oh, shit, we need to fix that.
[41:40.83]Even though you're just, like, you only made it up because they really wanted feedback.
[41:45.60]I don't know.
[41:47.12]Do you read into that?
[41:48.72]Okay, but actually, Stardew Valley, right?
[41:51.36]Yeah, okay, Stardew Valley.
[41:52.34]Stardew Valley had, like, a story about, like, your grandfather's farm, and there was, like, this corporation.
[41:57.95]Okay, by the way, I just got to cut you off.
[42:01.79]This is exactly what I mean about this game.
[42:03.71]What did I do?
[42:04.87]That I'm seriously jumping and hopping around in circles while these guys do not feel threatening at all.
[42:11.58]We're just like having a conversation.
[42:13.14]I don't know what's going on.
[42:15.44]We have to collect items from the thing.
[42:17.62]From the box.
[42:18.30]Okay.
[42:22.64]But there's these big guys.
[42:27.04]Are we just like kind of weirdos and talking about how we don't want cutscenes in our video games anymore?
[42:33.09]I mean...
[42:35.56]cat calling you weirdos are they question marking you no no I think about this is I don't think this is that unpopular of an opinion okay well they all grew up on like TikTok and Twitter they're like already on the next video they like click next already no they didn't they're still here well no that's a new that's they're not that's a new person that just showed up
[42:58.85]But I hate to kind of sit here and be like, everything is bad and I'm smart enough to see it, right?
[43:03.76]But I kind of feel like I've been playing the same game for 10 years.
[43:09.62]But was it like that back in like the 80s and 90s too?
[43:12.60]Like, right?
[43:13.02]Are we just like in a cycle?
[43:14.06]I don't know.
[43:15.00]It definitely was.
[43:16.16]Can you start opening these boxes so I can... I don't know.
[43:20.75]There's like these big guys with these hammers.
[43:24.31]Here I come.
[43:29.28]I don't think we're supposed to fight these guys.
[43:34.03]Who's this?
[43:37.13]We have to kill at least one of these guys.
[43:41.49]And why was that?
[43:42.25]Why did that even hit me?
[43:47.26]Nice.
[43:53.14]We got everything we need.
[43:59.76]I need to craft some heals bad.
[44:01.10]Is this health?
[44:06.04]I don't know.
[44:06.60]I think so.
[44:07.34]Yeah.
[44:19.01]I can't people understand the potential of the medium instead of trying to make interactive movies.
[44:23.69]Um.
[44:26.57]I don't know.
[44:26.97]How did you do that?
[44:30.79]I probably have like wall run and you don't.
[44:33.45]I think I have that though.
[44:35.21]I just ran at the wall.
[44:39.17]Alright, we gotta go this way.
[44:47.41]Okay, follow me.
[44:51.93]It's because of money.
[44:55.18]Do these games sell that well?
[44:57.10]I don't know.
[45:02.99]I guess they kind of do yeah.
[45:03.00]They have to sell a certain amount of well so you can only make a certain amount of risk and if you're putting a certain amount of marketing into it you can expect to sell a certain amount of copies and it's a very like-
[45:13.00]If you deviate from that formula, how much of your own money are you investing to put into it to be like: Well this weird thing might work?
[45:21.00]I don't know but I feel like if you did something interesting-
[45:22.00]And also keeping in mind that you're like a dude that doesn't play games. And you're the one who's like bankrolling the company.
[45:31.61]Video game boomer podcast, ResidentSleeper.
[45:36.81]No, we have to turn our compressors up to 100.
[45:42.47]You have a GoXLR, right?
[45:44.21]Yeah, I do.
[45:46.17]Can you guys hear me?
[45:47.51]Turn your compressor up to 100%.
[45:48.35]Are we doing this?
[45:53.16]Yes, we are.
[45:56.58]Okay.
[46:00.06]Okay.
[46:01.96]So, I mean, the thing is, it's like... You don't sound any different.
[46:05.02]I don't sound different at all?
[46:07.22]Maybe a little bit.
[46:08.58]Maybe a little bit?
[46:09.14]Do you think I don't sound different at all?
[46:10.18]Do I?
[46:13.06]I think I sound a little bit different.
[46:15.49]Yeah, I don't think I sound different.
[46:17.21]Oh, God.
[46:17.75]Yeah, you can turn it up a little bit.
[46:18.95]Turn it up.
[46:20.39]My, like, threshold?
[46:22.89]Okay.
[46:23.73]Just turn compressor to 100%.
[46:28.46]I mean, that's the thing, though.
[46:29.21]I think that as we get older, I mean, you're getting older, too.
[46:32.41]We're getting to a point where we're getting older.
[46:35.69]We're starting to see maybe what we don't like in the industry.
[46:39.37]I'm not getting old.
[46:41.20]Yes, you are.
[46:41.66]How am I getting older?
[46:44.86]Do you not want to say your age on stream?
[46:46.40]How old are you?
[46:48.20]31.
[46:48.98]Well, that's not super old, but that's still older.
[46:51.47]But aren't you like 53 now?
[46:54.27]Getting there.
[46:55.19]I feel like when you say old, it's a very different reality of what I'm living.
[47:00.86]But I think the issue at hand is we grew up in the 80s and 90s surrounded by these games.
[47:08.20]I did not grow up in the 80s.
[47:11.48]You grew up in the 90s.
[47:14.20]And get a little closer to your microphone, by the way.
[47:16.13]I'm not picking up the... Okay, so we grew up in the 90s.
[47:20.53]And honestly, we have a different perspective.
[47:24.13]We have a perspective that's a lot different than a lot of the younger generation here.
[47:28.19]And I think that we need to use all of our perspectives across old and young to be able to come up with solutions for these problems.
[47:37.92]What's the problem?
[47:38.86]The problem is these video game companies that might be... Oh, my God.
[47:42.50]You just kicked that lady in the face.
[47:44.36]Don't go overboard.
[47:45.26]I'm still doing my radio voice.
[47:46.87]You kicked that lady directly in the face.
[47:48.73]And I found it to be something that was a problem.
[47:51.35]And let's talk about why that was a problem.
[47:53.39]Yeah.
[47:54.16]Innocent people, you don't just drop kick in the face.
[47:56.45]And I think that that speaks to something about our current world.
[48:00.03]And... The game incentivizes it through experience gain.
[48:05.31]You know you're correct there.
[48:06.71]Let's deep dive that.
[48:08.48]So you got experience for hitting that innocent person.
[48:10.86]For instance, like I'm going to get experience for hitting this innocent person.
[48:14.40]Oh, this one gives a quest so you can't.
[48:18.52]Let's deep dive that.
[48:19.88]Is everything alright?
[48:21.25]I can hear you a mile away.
[48:22.79]Alright, I'm turning my compressor off.
[48:26.48]It really doesn't sound that different.
[48:27.66]You're just talking.
[48:28.28]Who is this guy?
[48:31.17]What?
[48:31.49]Who is that guy?
[48:35.33]Random NPC?
[48:41.95]Now I can laugh because I'm not doing a little funny routine.
[48:44.55]You dropkick that lady off the building.
[48:48.80]What the fuck?
[48:50.58]I skipped to night time so we could do the night mission that we just accepted from these people we just talked to and I don't know what it is.
[49:00.79]It's 169 meters away.
[49:04.03]Whatever it is.
[49:17.72]Will you talk?
[49:18.40]Say something.
[49:18.86]It's a boring stream.
[49:23.48]I was doing something.
[49:30.93]Dead air.
[49:31.81]Dead air.
[49:32.67]The podcaster's nightmare.
[49:35.31]Here, come over here.
[49:38.10]What?
[49:40.58]Come over here.
[49:44.50]Yes, I am here.
[49:45.26]What do you want me to do?
[49:47.20]Wait, can I not do it to these people?
[49:52.85]I don't think I can do it to him.
[49:54.59]Never mind.
[49:54.91]Are you trying to break this guy's neck?
[49:56.53]No, I wasn't.
[50:01.79]That didn't make any sense.
[50:02.73]We're on a quest.
[50:03.71]It doesn't have to make sense.
[50:05.41]We're in the game.
[50:06.27]I was just throwing some dead air out there until the conversation changed.
[50:15.86]Oh, we got flares.
[50:17.66]Well, alright.
[50:19.76]Alright, here comes content.
[50:31.76]Got it.
[50:33.46]Here, hold on.
[50:33.90]I got this guy.
[50:35.28]I wonder if you're going to kill him.
[50:36.28]I wonder if you're going to kill him.
[50:43.07]I just took something out of his pocket.
[50:44.69]He's not falling over.
[50:48.57]No, he's not falling over.
[50:49.79]That thing that's really funny in these open world games.
[50:52.54]You're making him fall.
[50:53.46]I'm bored now.
[50:53.96]Come on, do it.
[50:59.86]I can't that guy won't fall over he's immune no he's gonna fall and we're gonna like slap high fives oh the quest is right here he's talking to somebody he's talking to you he's like yeah what the you gonna do about it you want to do a quest you interested in this quest down here yep hey gas can
[51:30.13]Inhibitor container is nearby.
[51:31.67]Oh my fucking god.
[51:34.80]I didn't grab it.
[51:41.54]Oh shit.
[51:42.54]We got a goober.
[51:45.80]Is that health?
[51:47.50]These inhalers.
[51:48.70]I don't know which one is healing.
[51:51.80]Watch out.
[51:52.18]We're getting goobered.
[51:54.52]The quest is right here.
[51:55.38]We gotta go in.
[51:58.00]Oh shit.
[51:58.42]It's right there.
[52:05.77]You don't need to run.
[52:07.55]Alright.
[52:07.85]Where, where, where?
[52:08.51]Where is it?
[52:09.61]Search the ground floor of the Dark Hollow for Theodore.
[52:13.21]Theodore.
[52:15.07]He's in here somewhere.
[52:15.73]There's chemicals in here.
[52:16.37]We gotta be quick.
[52:17.55]Oh, shit.
[52:17.93]There's chemis.
[52:20.33]Theodore!
[52:23.94]Use your gamer dog vision.
[52:33.10]There's some vodka in there.
[52:33.96]Can't use.
[52:34.42]Enemy's nearby.
[52:35.14]What?
[52:39.77]Watch out for the chems.
[52:41.69]OK.
[52:51.00]We can only be in here for like another minute, by the way.
[52:52.98]Well, if you walk right here, you kind of reset.
[52:57.74]Are we sure that they're in here?
[53:00.22]It says look on the ground floor, but going upstairs sounds wrong.
[53:11.74]um I can't use enemies nearby what yeah the inhibitor is in that room we have to get rid of the chase oh we have to get rid of the chase well chase will go away if we stand in the light will it or are they not going to stop chase ended right your chase ended
[53:38.57]I believe it's ended.
[53:40.09]Okay, be stealthy this time.
[53:41.49]Is the ground floor up or down?
[53:42.97]Are you sure?
[53:44.19]Is the ground floor up or down?
[53:45.55]Go fuck yourself, dude.
[53:47.59]Okay.
[53:50.14]That's going to be a... That's going to be a maybe not talk to you for a while.
[53:59.76]Who the fuck are you?
[54:01.48]Come closer and I'll kill you.
[54:03.12]Will and Monica sent me.
[54:04.94]Weren't you talking shit about how in-game cutscenes annoyed you?
[54:09.59]Would you rather have in-game cutscenes or Mass Effect dialog choice?
[54:16.14]For no reason.
[54:17.52]I'd rather have neither.
[54:21.36]Who of these have mattered?
[54:23.12]I'm a gamer.
[54:25.18]And I love gameplay.
[54:26.42]I love true, authentic video gameplay.
[54:34.80]I love the classics.
[54:36.16]I'm talking like Assassin's Creed 2.
[54:41.26]I'm not.
[54:41.60]That was a... Someone was like, we're just serious?
[54:46.58]Wasn't the Assassin's Creed the first couple?
[54:48.34]Weren't they pretty good?
[54:52.00]I hated the first one.
[54:53.08]I know that.
[54:55.79]I'm morally opposed to the first Assassin's Creed game.
[54:59.13]Hold on.
[55:00.54]If you hate story... If I'm at the pearly gates and they're like, you gotta like Assassin's Creed 1, I'm going to hell.
[55:07.22]That's the criteria.
[55:10.04]St.
[55:10.36]Peter is just sitting there.
[55:12.60]He's wearing like an Ubisoft t-shirt.
[55:15.70]Yep.
[55:16.55]It would be.
[55:16.91]How did you feel about Assassin's Creed 1 and 2?
[55:21.79]2 was alright.
[55:26.31]Okay, you are saved, you're solid.
[55:29.03]Chase started!
[55:30.27]One was trash.
[55:36.83]Run!
[55:47.46]Run, dude!
[55:48.84]I'm running.
[55:49.92]They're getting me.
[55:52.17]Okay, you...
[55:54.37]You want to continue being negative negative?
[55:56.77]We're not being negative.
[55:58.02]I'm-
[55:58.76]You want to be like a more negative?
[55:59.56]You do this to me.
[56:01.78]You want to know what I hate?
[56:03.78]You know what I really dislike?
[56:04.50]No, I-
[56:07.39]Why not?
[56:08.39]Alright, what? Is it- is it video game related?
[56:10.39]It's health bars on enemies.
[56:12.39]Health bar? You can turn them off.
[56:14.39]Well, no. Like specifically like Assassin's Creed, the new Assassin's Creed: Odyssey.
[56:17.23]Where you can stealth assassinate people and kill them in one shot, but if you accidentally walk to the level 50 zone where they have their big health bars above their head.
[56:25.23]And you're like I can't assassinate this guy anymore and it's like: the fuck is this game then? What was the whole like Assassin's Creed like I'm a stealth- I can't stealth kill him because he's he's too higher level than the-
[56:38.71]Do you know who I am?
[56:39.51]Why don't you try making a game?
[56:40.69]My name is Ezio Ezio Eziri Beneficto or something.
[56:45.83]Why don't you try making a game?
[56:48.36]It's too hard.
[56:48.90]I'm not going to fucking do that.
[56:50.34]It's a waste of time.
[56:52.70]Just have nerds like this sitting around all day critiquing it.
[57:01.34]Need all players.
[57:04.76]But whoever carved the skin off the commander was a certified scientist.
[57:08.40]I'm cooming.
[57:09.70]Upgrade.
[57:11.16]I upgraded my health booster.
[57:12.74]I'm going to upgrade the immunity booster.
[57:20.27]Cool.
[57:20.37]Alright.
[57:22.27]But anyways, yeah, I think.
[57:26.11]I think that we are.
[57:27.11]What did you do?
[57:28.39]I talked to him.
[57:29.03]Where's your father?
[57:29.55]What are they doing here?
[57:34.67]can't wait wait wait I have a question before we go forward we have skipped every dialog yes we don't know what's going on we have an idea but um have I don't know how to put this watch yourself you hear
[57:56.20]Hasn't each mission kind of still felt like the same?
[57:58.22]Like it doesn't matter what they had said, each mission is kind of like the same.
[58:01.86]Yeah, I mean, you could say that about a lot of things, but yeah.
[58:03.96]People are saying Mario RPG has dialog.
[58:06.36]Why do you care?
[58:07.22]Because Mario RPG was kind of an interesting story.
[58:15.19]Mario RPG was interesting.
[58:16.75]You can't say that.
[58:17.81]You're not allowed to say that.
[58:19.17]Because I'm sorry.
[58:21.15]This game's fun.
[58:22.39]It is.
[58:23.07]But like zombie apocalypse, find your daughter.
[58:27.50]I've seen this movie a hundred fucking times.
[58:30.66]It's not your daughter.
[58:31.78]You know what?
[58:32.26]It doesn't matter.
[58:32.98]Replace daughter with any other person.
[58:37.46]Where's the vaccine, though?
[58:39.46]That's what I mean.
[58:41.06]I've seen this movie.
[58:44.13]Mario RPG is a movie that I haven't seen since.
[58:48.51]What about, um... In fact, they deleted half the characters from the fucking universe.
[58:52.51]So, how dare you compare that to this, considering that, like, Mallow is dead.
[58:58.30]They killed him.
[58:59.80]How dare you say the shit you're saying when I'm pretty sure The Last of Us 2 won, like, best writing ever, and it's also a zombie game.
[59:13.24]Zombies are... Killian!
[59:18.93]Everyone we know is dying all the time.
[59:30.02]Let's be real, because people can critique us on our dumbest shitty opinions, okay?
[59:33.98]Okay.
[59:34.40]What do you think was the last AAA game?
[59:36.42]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[59:45.75]I, like, exploded him.
[59:49.20]What was the last AAA major release video game that you played that you said, that was actually a really cool story?
[59:57.80]Like, I'm very invested in this, and I want to know what happens.
[60:00.76]Dude, I have such a small brain, I would need a list of the games I've played.
[60:09.12]It's probably God of War.
[60:13.39]But isn't God of War the same thing?
[60:14.65]Like, oh, where's my boy?
[60:19.15]Yes, it is.
[60:24.94]Disco Elysium?
[60:25.80]Yeah, it's not your play.
[60:28.08]You play Disco Elysium?
[60:29.26]No, I heard it's good.
[60:31.74]You're going to keep complaining.
[60:33.37]Games that don't have good stories.
[60:34.69]I'm just going to skip all the ones with good stories.
[60:36.77]Ugh.
[60:41.10]But it was, okay.
[60:43.69]God of War was cool, though.
[60:45.79]It was cool.
[60:48.95]I think we just hate zombie games.
[60:51.63]What are you talking about?
[60:52.89]I said this game's been fun.
[60:55.25]No, I'm talking about story.
[60:56.57]Story, story, story.
[60:57.53]I said story.
[60:58.31]Zombies are like, who gives a shit?
[61:00.85]Just beat them up.
[61:01.81]Put as many on screen as you possibly can, and that's why I'm saying Dying Light 1 was better, because they put more zombies on my screen, and that's all I care about.
[61:16.56]What?
[61:17.80]What?
[61:20.82]Okay, you mentioned Last of Us.
[61:23.26]Isn't The Last of Us considered, like, really, really good gameplay?
[61:26.92]Like, it's a very good game?
[61:28.80]I've never played any of them.
[61:29.92]I just assumed that Kana would rile someone up.
[61:32.38]Oh.
[61:35.80]Not?
[61:36.18]The gameplay's not good.
[61:37.58]Oh.
[61:38.10]Oh.
[61:45.92]The Last of Us is only well regarded for this story.
[61:48.46]Really?
[61:53.50]All I know is that occasionally people complain that there's like women in The Last of Us or some shit.
[62:00.22]Was BioShock Infinite really good?
[62:02.02]I like feel like enough time's gone by.
[62:03.68]I liked that game.
[62:04.68]Does that make me like a weird like normie or something?
[62:08.40]Wait, that BioShock Infinite was what?
[62:10.30]That BioShock Infinite was good.
[62:15.36]Like, it was an interesting concept.
[62:17.30]Like, the BioShock series might be the last time that I was like, holy shit, that was fucking actually phenomenal.
[62:23.74]Like, the story.
[62:25.70]BioShock 1, like, BioShock Infinite.
[62:27.87]I feel like it was, like, phenomenal.
[62:28.95]Flare!
[62:29.15]Save that guy!
[62:30.39]Save that guy.
[62:30.93]Oh, fuck!
[62:31.35]Save me instead!
[62:44.75]What about Red Dead?
[62:47.09]Red Dead was... Okay, yep.
[62:49.72]Red Dead Redemption 2 was... I liked what they did in Red Dead 2.
[62:54.66]This is what I mean.
[62:55.48]When we can sit here and be reminded of games, it's easy to forget how many good things there are, and you just sit around and like, just, I don't even remember.
[63:03.80]And then someone will go, what about this game?
[63:05.30]You go, oh yeah, and what about this?
[63:06.86]Oh yeah, and what about this?
[63:07.84]Yeah, it was good too.
[63:10.35]just laser focused on like the one zombie apocalypse genre and forgetting every other phenomenal game that's come out yeah every game is a zombie game and I don't like it I swear to god you have to save me I'm just jumping around and dying what what do I have to do
[63:40.85]Negativity for the sake of negativity, but I don't know but I this game's not bad.
[63:45.03]It's like it's this is fun You to be in a Discord call with somebody that's like one of your I mean a friend of yours I wouldn't call him a good friend I'd call them like a pretty decent friend like a you know like an acquaintance level up like I would say Like then you could like a hang out with that person hang out kill some zombies just talk and hang out It's just a fun time Like this is that is there's nothing wrong with that
[64:18.08]Are you just hopping around?
[64:21.94]Um, the marker is over here.
[64:23.18]Oh.
[64:26.48]You just, this is your co-worker.
[64:34.80]He said, just fucking go outside, dude.
[64:37.73]That's what I'm saying.
[64:42.07]Video games?
[64:42.79]Have you guys tried in real life sports games?
[64:47.80]No.
[64:53.90]But forget about zombies.
[64:56.46]I played Far Cry 4, Far Cry 5, Far Cry 6, whatever.
[65:01.75]I feel like I'm in that game right now.
[65:03.51]I feel like I'm in the game now and there's no cars.
[65:07.09]There are doors right here.
[65:08.53]You are in the game right now.
[65:12.22]See, Dying Light 1, it was a good game.
[65:15.25]And then Ubisoft, in between Dying Light 1 and 2, released about 50 of the same game.
[65:19.15]And they were like, wow, that model's successful.
[65:20.82]Let's do that.
[65:21.40]And then they did it.
[65:26.50]right we have to move on because I think we've been talking about like the video game podcast routine dying light zombie games are boring since like an hour and 12 minutes ago yes like ask me a stupid question about McDonald's alright alright alright so dude uh what's your order at Wendy's would you say I think mine is chicken nuggets and uh asiago ranch asiago cheese
[65:54.83]You have unused inhibitors, I do?
[65:57.68]Oh shit, I do.
[66:00.74]Oh, I got something for you.
[66:07.40]Why is Asiago cheese only ever sprinkled on baked bread?
[66:12.49]How come it's never on anything else?
[66:13.99]It's only like, oh, and by the way, the bread, it's got Asiago cheese baked on top of it.
[66:19.07]I want to eat it normally.
[66:19.99]Why the fuck do they always do that?
[66:21.63]I'm not a cheese expert.
[66:23.63]I don't know.
[66:24.69]It tastes so good.
[66:25.67]Why is it only like the little bacon bits that are sprinkled on the edge of like a pizza crust?
[66:31.72]My chat says it is.
[66:32.94]He's narrow-minded.
[66:34.08]Oh.
[66:35.26]Okay.
[66:36.16]Oops.
[66:39.33]We gotta plant the bombs over here.
[66:40.27]That's actually kind of cool looking.
[66:47.44]When's the last time you really sat down and had a AAA sandwich that didn't just put Asiago on it?
[66:54.70]Yeah, like these AA sandwich developers.
[66:57.08]I think they're doing a much better job.
[67:00.64]Yeah, every time I've had an indie sandwich and come away with like a really unique experience, I've always remembered it more and always wanted it more.
[67:07.93]I mean like the AAA sandwich dev is putting like a slice of avocado on everything.
[67:11.61]I mean like I'm kind of getting sick of that, the avocado shit.
[67:14.47]Hey, these guys are level 6.
[67:16.03]Are they?
[67:16.51]Oh no.
[67:25.72]He almost one-shot me.
[67:27.10]I swear to God I wouldn't be surprised if like a meatball sub had avocado on it.
[67:35.16]It's always like an extra dollar.
[67:43.57]Yep, we have avocado as an extra dollar fifty.
[67:54.79]What does this do?
[68:07.40]He's not even being ironic anymore.
[68:11.60]These AAA sandwich devs.
[68:14.36]I love them.
[68:15.27]These guys are kicking our ass.
[68:23.25]We gotta use the environment to our advantage, bro.
[68:26.38]There's all this swamp water they conveniently live by.
[68:28.98]I love avocado.
[68:32.50]Avocado's delicious.
[68:33.82]I just- I just don't want it on, like, number one through four out of the ten things on the menu.
[68:49.67]We gotta blow this up.
[68:51.99]Um...
[68:53.66]Do you want to do it?
[68:54.74]Help me.
[68:58.95]I wonder if these guys drop anything sick.
[69:02.33]Yeah, I bet their loot tables are insane.
[69:08.91]You missed.
[69:10.27]I didn't.
[69:10.75]He just took it.
[69:13.17]Like that game with the great story.
[69:14.53]Boy, take it.
[69:15.71]Whoa.
[69:22.36]I'll take a lot of avocados.
[69:24.34]I'll take a lot of avocado and everything.
[69:27.22]God, can you imagine?
[69:27.94]Put, like, millennials avocado.
[69:30.38]Thanks for the points.
[69:31.14]I got internet points.
[69:31.84]Uh, I like avocados.
[69:35.12]So do I. They're delicious.
[69:36.34]They have a ton of good fats.
[69:37.32]They're really good for you.
[69:38.21]And, like, sure.
[69:39.11]Put it on a bunch of stuff.
[69:39.89]Because if you put avocado, like, smear on, like, a ham sandwich, and, like, the motherfucker doesn't even know it's on there, it's just healthy.
[69:47.37]And they're going to feel better.
[69:48.31]They're going to have vitamins.
[69:49.87]Why am I complaining about this?
[69:50.89]Who cares?
[69:51.31]Who cares?
[69:55.85]They go bad kind of quickly, though.
[69:59.51]But I think that just might be their, uh, their plan to obsolescence, you know?
[70:07.60]What's your favorite, um, condiment on a sandwich?
[70:12.68]If it's pretty much anything.
[70:13.74]Like, when I say condiment, what's your favorite addition to a sandwich?
[70:17.80]Uh, we talk, like, we're talking what kind of sandwich?
[70:20.76]Just in general, like a, like a cold cup.
[70:25.48]Hmm.
[70:27.56]Hmm.
[70:31.14]Hmm.
[70:33.00]You lost me like 6,000 viewers, by the way.
[70:34.80]Thanks a lot.
[70:35.84]Did I?
[70:36.16]Yeah.
[70:37.14]Because I didn't instantly answer your fucking stupid question sandwich question?
[70:41.16]No, you started talking like video game politics.
[70:44.06]You started that whole conversation.
[70:46.04]I was like, I'm surprised Jerma's going here.
[70:47.56]Jerma's usually not this negative.
[70:48.76]This is usually me.
[70:49.58]This is why I have no viewers.
[70:53.62]And then you just kept going.
[70:58.67]But, honestly, God.
[70:59.17]What do you... Mine's... Well, I want to hear yours first.
[71:04.07]um I I don't know what it is I don't know what the full combo is but as a as a a young lad who grew up in New Jersey I gotta say Jersey Mike's the like there's some like classic jersey put this on a cold sub that is like yeah that's jersey I'm gonna go down the shore and say weird things to other people at the shore oh you're talking about oregano Mike's yeah oregano Mike oregano Mike's okay
[71:33.03]It's not like any one thing.
[71:34.32]It's like there's salt and vinegar and oregano Mike's and something else.
[71:41.86]Last few times I ordered Jersey Mike's, it was like an oregano sandwich.
[71:46.19]Okay.
[71:55.48]So you like oregano?
[71:58.37]I mean, Oregano's pretty good.
[72:00.00]You didn't say a condiment.
[72:01.32]You just said, I like Jersey Mike's.
[72:03.18]No, it's the thing that... Because that's what people would understand now.
[72:06.68]Growing up in New Jersey, there was this place I lived.
[72:08.96]It was called Big Wally's.
[72:10.00]It was a local... Alright.
[72:11.76]Did you put the bomb?
[72:13.37]Or local business.
[72:14.19]And they put, like, the same shit on it.
[72:15.57]So apparently, it's like a New Jersey thing.
[72:17.19]And I didn't know until, like, they called their place Jersey Mike's.
[72:19.95]And I was like, you know what?
[72:20.91]I did have these back in Jersey.
[72:22.51]Okay, but what's... Which is where it all began.
[72:24.89]What's on it?
[72:27.34]It's like...
[72:29.14]Salt and vinegar and... What the fuck is this?
[72:34.16]What is the mixture?
[72:35.80]I don't know.
[72:36.40]That was my question.
[72:37.30]My question was, what do you like on a sandwich?
[72:39.49]And you said, I like this sandwich place.
[72:42.03]No, I'm not saying I like this sandwich place.
[72:44.83]I'm saying Jersey Mike's, they typically put that mixture of Jersey things on their Jersey sandwiches.
[72:50.27]Okay.
[72:51.05]But I never really knew exactly what it was.
[72:56.56]Okay, hold on.
[72:57.40]He's got me going to the menu.
[72:59.76]I literally typed Jerma into my, like, food delivery menu.
[73:05.95]No, you don't want to order the Jerma.
[73:07.19]Trust me, you'll puke.
[73:08.87]It's like four tablespoons of mayonnaise, turkey, lettuce, and, like, a bunch of honey mustard.
[73:14.09]You'd probably throw up if you ate it.
[73:17.35]Olive oil blend, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt.
[73:23.04]I think that's like the classic, we're going to drench this shit in some sort of like sewage water, but it's going to taste good.
[73:31.79]I'm a big fan of mayo on turkey sandwiches.
[73:33.73]And now obviously when I said three tablespoons, that was a joke.
[73:37.41]Okay.
[73:38.03]Oh, um, I changed my answer.
[73:41.77]You did?
[73:42.85]Yeah, I changed it.
[73:44.90]lettuce mayo turkey and cheddar it's like it's probably my all-time favorite just cold cut sandwich turkey and mayo is in general just like a like a Thanksgiving sandwich too turkey cranberry like stuffing thick cut turkey oh my god turkey and mayonnaise is unbelievable it's the best combination
[74:05.67]Some Chipotle aioli.
[74:09.07]Chipotle what?
[74:10.19]Chipotle aioli.
[74:12.93]I don't know.
[74:13.23]I thought you said Chipotle bologna.
[74:15.01]And I was like, wait, that's actually kind of sounds kind of good.
[74:17.43]Wait, am I wrong?
[74:19.31]Is my brain melting?
[74:21.15]Have I been talking to Jerma for too long?
[74:23.43]Is that what it's called?
[74:30.99]Yeah, I don't know.
[74:32.61]I'm lost.
[74:36.43]Do we have to... I think we have to... I think you gotta talk to him.
[74:40.89]Oh.
[74:41.75]I just... I did... I did you, and I did the mission, and then I climbed on the roof.
[74:46.21]People hate mayo because they're just like, Oh, it's... Oh, you like mayo?
[74:50.31]It's... Oh, gross!
[74:51.89]You know that mayo's like a thick, creamy, white substance?
[74:56.25]Oh, please.
[74:56.79]It's kind of bland.
[75:09.78]That's why I'm saying, that's why I'm saying aioli out here, because it's just, it's just mayonnaise.
[75:13.14]Aioli is, do you know what, yeah, I was going to say, aioli is mayonnaise.
[75:16.28]Yeah, but it's, like, flavored with something.
[75:19.34]It's, like, mayonnaise is the water.
[75:22.41]The creamy, gross water of sandwiches.
[75:24.59]No, but it, mayo pulls out a lot of flavors.
[75:27.71]That's why it's in a ton of aiolis.
[75:29.47]It's why it's the base of a ton of shit.
[75:31.61]Yeah, but it's a base.
[75:32.83]It's not, like, the good part.
[75:34.23]When you put mayo and turkey and cranberry sauce mixed together, it makes an incredible combination.
[75:38.76]Okay, but...
[75:42.10]Is it the cranberry sauce or the mayo that you're like really wooed by here?
[75:46.29]It's both combined.
[75:50.75]I like cranberry sauce, but if it's like a cranberry mayo, it's ten times better.
[75:57.09]Oh, we're being timed.
[75:58.19]Yes, we are.
[75:58.63]Oh, this thing.
[76:05.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[76:07.52]Was I not supposed to do that?
[76:09.46]On my screen, you're holding on to nothing.
[76:11.10]You're just floating.
[76:13.46]How long am I supposed to hold this for?
[76:15.36]Uh, a while.
[76:17.24]Um... Um, I'm gonna run out of gear.
[76:19.42]I'm gonna run out of grip.
[76:21.04]I'm gonna run out of grip.
[76:23.43]Hold on, hold on.
[76:26.67]Oh!
[76:27.89]What?
[76:30.83]Shit.
[76:32.63]Uh... Uh...
[76:41.97]You just went by the right side.
[76:44.21]You went right by peripheral.
[76:45.63]Are you okay?
[76:52.58]Did you make it?
[76:53.16]Oh, God.
[76:54.38]I went to go get you, and it just took me off again.
[76:58.50]I'm sure I can do this in 30 seconds.
[77:00.10]How come I... Is it going to explode?
[77:05.09]I don't know.
[77:05.69]Why won't anyone tell us what's going on?
[77:12.01]How come I can't just force kill?
[77:21.74]Oh no, Tony Soprano's about to walk over here with a propane tank.
[77:28.66]He's gonna be setting up his grill.
[77:31.00]See?
[77:31.77]He's gonna be pissed that it doesn't work, and he's gonna punch it.
[77:34.81]Yep.
[77:35.73]Show's over.
[77:36.29]Okay.
[77:37.11]This is important, dude.
[77:39.43]Two minutes and thirty seconds.
[77:42.52]Your street cred on the line.
[77:47.67]You're a parkour master.
[77:50.91]Somebody said a Sopranos reference.
[77:52.69]You may have missed the last stream.
[77:55.48]Yeah, that's all we talk about now.
[77:56.64]We're huge Sopranos fans.
[77:57.86]We love Jersey Mike because it's from Jersey.
[77:59.68]Every stream is just sandwiches and TV show references.
[78:04.00]It's the only thing.
[78:07.26]Yeah.
[78:08.86]What the fuck is... Where do you go from here?
[78:11.86]I think you need to jump to the other... Yeah, there you go.
[78:14.50]Okay.
[78:14.82]Did I do it?
[78:16.82]Careful on this.
[78:17.34]This is really thin.
[78:23.93]From here, I don't know.
[78:24.69]Come on, come on, come on.
[78:26.21]Faster.
[78:27.75]You're not.
[78:29.70]Yeah.
[78:31.08]Wait, we have to wait for this to... Okay, I got it.
[78:41.75]Oh fuck, okay.
[78:42.91]Now from here it's this way.
[78:52.44]Uh, which way?
[78:59.56]Boop boop boop.
[79:13.40]Did you fall?
[79:17.19]You fell, didn't you?
[79:18.69]It did.
[79:19.61]I'm gonna make it though.
[79:20.51]It's up to you.
[79:21.09]I'll do it.
[79:27.72]Thank god I made it.
[79:34.18]Do you need me to be there to plant it?
[79:36.48]Nope.
[79:36.76]Okay.
[79:37.22]Okay.
[79:37.94]I was gonna say that'd be bad.
[79:42.22]Yeah, this is why I play games with you.
[79:45.86]You're so good at them.
[79:51.82]That's what I did.
[79:53.43]But you died down here.
[79:54.85]I didn't die.
[79:55.45]I landed in the water.
[80:04.87]You know what I mean?
[80:05.67]That was like $345,000 to do that.
[80:08.77]Yeah, why did we have only two minutes to blow it up?
[80:11.05]Was the C4 already timed?
[80:14.58]Maybe, like, what did this guy have to say?
[80:16.44]Why'd you skip?
[80:17.26]Like, that costs probably so much dev money to do that.
[80:25.03]Oh my god, dude.
[80:26.03]What?
[80:30.44]My phone.
[80:32.90]Uber Eats on my phone.
[80:34.76]Jersey Mike subs on your mind?
[80:37.26]You're one tap away.
[80:38.14]Shut the fuck up.
[80:42.69]They know I'm here.
[80:42.99]Weren't you typing it into that app?
[80:45.99]I was. So now they're trying to get me.
[80:48.00]I totally like my brain forgot that I was already doing it and I thought that they tapped into my uh- because I'm- I'm already under surveillance for that other thing.
[80:54.00]But this is- this is not like a oh no the iPhone's listening to me.
[80:58.50]This is: you typed in Jersey Mike's into that app they're- they're recommending it.
[81:00.00]Yeah. Yes but now it's targeted ads and we don't like those because we don't want anything to be advertised.
[81:12.02]I don't want people to listen to me.
[81:15.00]I do.
[81:15.34]That's why I'm streaming.
[81:22.39]I don't know if you saw, but one time I was browsing YouTube.
[81:28.08]And I got an ad for this place.
[81:32.06]And it was just popped up a banner ad.
[81:33.42]It was like, I don't know, five or six videos in.
[81:37.06]And this thing said, oh, luxury apartments starting at $21,000.
[81:41.63]And I think that was a month.
[81:46.53]And I was sitting there just freaking out because everybody was saying that was a targeted ad.
[81:54.27]But that would be fucking crazy.
[81:58.16]You're not paying $21,000 a month for your apartment?
[82:01.46]No.
[82:02.97]Wait, what do we do?
[82:06.61]Do we lie to Alberto and not show up on time?
[82:10.31]Yeah.
[82:11.27]Okay.
[82:11.63]I don't remember what I said to him, so it's like I never did.
[82:21.00]$20,000 a month in home cost.
[82:21.92]What is that a year?
[82:23.30]$250,000 a year.
[82:23.68]A lot of money.
[82:24.80]That's like buying a house every year.
[82:27.86]What the fuck, man?
[82:28.52]I'm done.
[82:28.72]I'm out of here.
[82:29.06]Can you help me?
[82:51.24]That's buying a house.
[82:53.08]That's almost buying a house every single year of your life.
[82:55.63]That's such a great neighborhood.
[83:01.27]Whoops.
[83:03.27]I accidentally did cocaine.
[83:09.38]I just imagine you put a line on your desk.
[83:13.72]And you, like, sneeze.
[83:15.46]And you smash your head as hard as you can onto the desk and, like, hurt your head.
[83:18.90]And- Oh, fuck!
[83:23.82]I didn't mean to do that.
[83:24.63]No, oh no, I feel weird.
[83:32.05]Yep.
[83:36.28]Yep.
[83:43.52]This is not dead air.
[83:51.29]Oh, come on.
[83:53.87]It's not dead air.
[83:55.05]It's been five seconds.
[83:56.89]You can't just talk for an infinite amount of time forever.
[84:01.79]We need time for our brains to think about something.
[84:04.45]Like, we can't just speak forever, constantly.
[84:07.71]Like, we need 10 seconds sometimes to be like, okay, this is the next sentence I'm going to say.
[84:12.27]I think I'm going to say that now.
[84:16.08]Stalling.
[84:20.46]I actually might be stupid.
[84:21.44]I don't know, it's starting to become clear.
[84:23.60]Did you?
[84:24.36]No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[84:26.64]Why can I not grab this, but you can?
[84:31.70]Oh, what?
[84:32.86]On my screen, you jumped and grabbed that.
[84:36.77]I did grab something.
[84:45.39]I'm buying some medicine.
[84:46.49]72 damage.
[84:47.18]It's insane.
[84:50.56]Yeah, I need... I bought some medicine from this guy.
[84:54.48]He's selling some drugs.
[84:56.32]I want this helmet.
[84:57.40]And I want these gloves, too.
[85:00.92]Muscle booster.
[85:01.80]Oh, you're gonna want that muscle booster.
[85:06.69]Immunity, endurance.
[85:09.21]I want health.
[85:10.01]Does this guy have honey?
[85:11.37]I haven't crafted anything since the tutorial.
[85:14.77]What?
[85:15.17]Feels like.
[85:31.92]Kind of be feeling like... This is totally my face when... Oh yeah, I can craft 13 medicines.
[85:43.16]And you've been saying the whole time how much you don't have health or healing.
[85:51.11]Yeah.
[85:52.57]You have been saying that.
[85:54.57]Yeah, it's been a problem.
[85:57.31]Well, just get on it.
[86:04.43]How are streamers simultaneously supposed to be the ones who talk to people endlessly without dead air, but also are always in their chair so they never leave and have life experience?
[86:15.13]Are you running out of stuff to talk about?
[86:18.29]Have we ran out of stuff to talk about?
[86:19.53]I mean, it's been a long time since we've started.
[86:22.17]I mean, you like the last episode of Game of Thrones?
[86:26.29]Why are you giving me all your health packs?
[86:29.79]You were hurt.
[86:31.53]Yeah, but I've helped.
[86:32.41]I'm a support.
[86:34.53]Oh, okay.
[86:36.64]What's this one do for damage?
[86:37.60]I think 73.
[86:39.36]No, that's way better.
[86:45.20]Alright, so now we have to go this way.
[86:46.62]Hey, what's up with the Olympics?
[86:51.48]I don't know.
[86:52.24]I didn't even know they were on.
[86:54.05]exactly they're doing the olympics right now and then I brought that up and uh Ashley's mom was like you're crazy because they had the olympics during the summer yeah they have the winner and the they're doing the winter olympics now but usually they're doing they usually there's a two-year gap right I'm not crazy um it's been two years since the summer olympics
[87:15.81]No, it hasn't.
[87:16.71]Because I remember watching the Summer Olympics while I was at a gamer's house.
[87:21.32]And that was in August-ish.
[87:22.60]That was in July.
[87:24.24]Oh, no, no.
[87:24.72]Yeah, it's because of COVID.
[87:26.18]They delayed it because of COVID.
[87:26.92]What's that?
[87:28.10]You don't know what COVID-19 is?
[87:30.14]Yes, you do.
[87:30.90]Stop it.
[87:31.82]Stop faking for content because we have no more life experiences to talk about.
[87:36.39]What is that?
[87:36.89]Alright.
[87:43.17]I want to grab this and go down.
[87:45.93]Maybe if we stop doing like a weird Looney Tunes, Wile E. Coyote way to grab this.
[87:50.10]So wait, because of COVID, they're doing more Olympics?
[87:53.80]The Olympics in Tokyo were delayed.
[87:56.66]Yeah.
[87:57.12]So they did it.
[87:58.12]So now they're just they're doing the winter one on schedule.
[88:00.89]I don't know.
[88:01.29]I have no idea.
[88:01.93]I'm not I don't know anything about the Olympics.
[88:03.35]Okay.
[88:05.03]You didn't tell them to like wait a year and be like, hey, how about we just like chill for a bit?
[88:09.61]I think that's what happened.
[88:11.43]Yeah.
[88:12.83]Yeah, that's what happened.
[88:14.47]But then how are there two Olympics in one year?
[88:17.25]Because they delayed the Summer Olympics a year because of COVID.
[88:22.24]So then they did the Summer Olympics, and then they were already scheduled to do the Winter Olympics, so they're doing the Winter Olympics on time.
[88:27.14]Yeah, but the Winter Olympics, isn't there a bigger gap than that usually?
[88:31.84]You're throwing for content.
[88:33.56]I'm serious.
[88:34.68]I thought there was at least a two-year gap minimum between Summer and Winter.
[88:41.34]But they cycle it.
[88:44.70]See, this is why we don't want to have conversations.
[88:47.02]This is what I'm not bringing up.
[88:49.37]This is what I'm saving everyone from.
[88:54.51]They push the summer back, yeah.
[88:56.91]Whoa, this is kind of crazy.
[89:02.85]The dates, they still don't add up to me.
[89:06.93]I mean, there was a delay, and that's it.
[89:10.98]Hey, hey, you got to run.
[89:13.13]Run, run, run.
[89:13.95]He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.
[89:15.07]He's going to do something.
[89:16.29]Run, run.
[89:17.83]He's here.
[89:18.17]I tried to warn you.
[89:29.24]I have never been able to do like the slide under this.
[89:35.14]Oh, there.
[89:35.52]Oh, you got to hold it.
[89:37.33]Yeah, will you hold C?
[89:37.95]Yeah.
[89:41.81]Are you one of those useless people who binds Crouch to C because it starts with Crouch?
[89:47.49]What does that mean?
[89:49.27]It's like drinking a Gatorade.
[89:50.93]You're just ready for a fight.
[89:58.26]Got a couple of Zeds.
[90:03.28]Should we check some of these buildings?
[90:05.68]Or materials?
[90:08.60]Do you need materials?
[90:09.78]Why is there a waypoint on this?
[90:10.64]Did you put the waypoint there?
[90:12.44]I might have by accident a long time ago.
[90:16.93]I want to get to the new zone.
[90:18.09]It's not going to happen.
[90:22.15]This has to be soon.
[90:23.27]We just blew this zone up.
[90:24.45]Can we please just go to the objective?
[90:25.79]We cheated and put a bunch of EXP points in and we're not going to get there.
[90:40.18]we got soldiers break his neck break his neck break his neck break his neck this is what I'm talking about with the health bars where you throw molotovs on people and they act like bees are near them
[91:06.90]So stupid.
[91:08.46]That should not... It should not kill somebody.
[91:15.62]Getting hit in the head by an axe doesn't kill you.
[91:18.88]But getting dropkicked WWE style does.
[91:23.36]Yeah.
[91:25.02]Do you not respect wrestlers?
[91:26.24]Do you think they're not putting their lives on the line every time a dropkick comes out?
[91:29.90]Triple H. You know what I'm saying?
[91:32.80]Yeah.
[91:37.00]Random mission here.
[91:39.82]No, we're going to the main quest.
[91:42.98]I don't want to hear anything from you.
[91:46.50]You so badly want to get us to the other island, but I don't think it's going to happen, man.
[91:51.96]How are we not right there when this island just got blown up?
[91:55.32]All the loose ends are dealt with.
[91:57.33]Every person has betrayed us.
[92:00.53]We've killed everyone.
[92:06.48]I need a player here.
[92:07.80]Come on.
[92:08.42]I'm right there.
[92:17.33]Hakon.
[92:18.47]Hakon betrayed us.
[92:21.29]Oh.
[92:22.09]See, we're going.
[92:22.67]I still have some coffee left.
[92:23.69]That's kind of pog.
[92:24.45]Yeah, it's kind of pog, dude.
[92:31.21]I was just about to say this guy's going to die in this scene.
[92:33.48]I should have said it.
[92:34.16]What a stupid idiot.
[92:35.18]I was going to say it.
[92:36.14]I promise I was.
[92:37.30]Calm down.
[92:37.68]Just let me see.
[92:38.76]Everyone's dead.
[92:39.84]Now we can go to the next area.
[92:42.54]I can't believe I didn't say it.
[92:43.56]It would have been perfect.
[92:44.34]Dying my arms.
[92:46.74]If so, you killed Lucas.
[92:48.04]If not for those brass knuckles, it would have only took a few seconds to do the job.
[92:52.76]I thought he was a better fighter.
[92:56.30]No point denying it with this wound.
[92:57.72]Waltz.
[92:59.48]Wait, don't skip.
[93:00.20]Let him talk.
[93:02.14]You don't get it, kid.
[93:03.74]You like watching people in pain?
[93:05.66]This is the first cut scene to like grab your attention.
[93:09.86]I couldn't have told you.
[93:11.56]Is it because he kind of looks like me a little bit?
[93:13.02]He's the one who tortured me in the past.
[93:14.20]Does he have black hair?
[93:15.20]He kind of does kind of look like you.
[93:16.74]Yeah, he does have black hair.
[93:17.94]So he's like, he does look like me.
[93:19.34]He's got like scars all across his face and he's like 40 years old.
[93:22.90]Where is he?
[93:23.32]Kind of looks like me.
[93:28.89]This guy was double-crossing us.
[93:35.56]Yeah.
[93:37.78]We have to make a choice.
[93:43.12]Leave him to die or help him.
[93:45.02]He did betray us.
[93:46.32]He did.
[93:47.02]He did, but he did give us our wristwatch.
[93:50.24]And he put us through that long fucking tutorial.
[93:52.74]He did make us do a tutorial, you're right.
[93:54.62]He is the reason why the tutorial happened.
[93:57.33]But if it wasn't going to be Hakann, it would have been somebody else.
[94:00.99]I'm going to let him die.
[94:01.89]I'm going to help him.
[94:04.81]Heard an impasse here.
[94:07.93]I should leave you to die for what you did.
[94:11.09]Why wouldn't you?
[94:13.46]I'm going to find that sniper first.
[94:17.24]Well, now he's guaranteed to die because... Really?
[94:20.76]You'd do that for me?
[94:23.32]Yeah, that was bad.
[94:30.62]Didn't hit any major organs, so I think he's okay.
[94:33.54]Yeah.
[94:39.28]You have to push the arrow in.
[94:41.16]No, you don't.
[94:43.50]Everybody pretends to know what to do in that scenario, but I don't think anybody really does.
[94:47.50]You pour some, like, acid on it, right, to just dissolve the thing?
[94:56.63]Are we going down the tube?
[94:59.01]Yeah, we actually get to go down it.
[95:00.21]Let me see.
[95:02.49]I want to... How are you going to put this tube here and I can't go down this tube?
[95:09.69]Wait, you can't go down the tube?
[95:11.49]Yes, you can.
[95:12.59]Why?
[95:13.05]What?
[95:14.79]Nice.
[95:16.65]Yeah.
[95:17.11]Those boats fly far and fast.
[95:19.93]Find something to hide behind.
[95:22.25]Tell me something I don't already know, Hakon.
[95:31.38]Watch out for all the chemical waste.
[95:33.50]I got eyes, Hakon.
[95:36.06]Somebody's shooting us with a sniper rifle bow and arrow.
[95:41.13]Alright.
[95:42.13]Did the arrow stick out of you?
[95:44.19]No.
[95:45.07]Oh, I was going to say let's sit here and just heal and get like a thousand arrows in us.
[95:49.55]Can you take that guy out from here?
[95:52.24]How?
[95:52.52]No, we don't have range weapons or guns.
[95:55.22]I just threw an explosive coin.
[95:57.04]Got him with a grenade.
[95:58.44]Did you?
[95:59.98]I think so.
[96:01.12]What the?
[96:11.30]Wait, this is not how chutes and ladders works.
[96:14.22]Hold on.
[96:15.10]I see him, Aiden.
[96:15.78]He's sticking to the roofs.
[96:17.62]Go!
[96:18.34]How do I get up there?
[96:19.48]He's running.
[96:19.94]Uh... It's gonna hurt me!
[96:30.03]Make sure you use your healing kits.
[96:32.35]I mean, I have... mushrooms.
[96:34.09]Mushrooms don't heal you.
[96:35.79]One second until I'm dead!
[96:39.55]I'm okay.
[96:40.93]Remember, the floor is lava, dude.
[96:43.07]That makes sense.
[96:46.98]Now we gotta go up this way.
[96:48.44]We gotta get up this way.
[96:49.16]What do we do?
[96:52.12]We're not gonna let this guy get away with shooting Hakann, the guy who betrayed us, and that we're gonna save.
[96:58.02]This is... I mean, who makes it like this?
[97:02.73]Like, why not just make an elevator?
[97:06.45]They took the time to, like...
[97:09.09]outline it in yellow and all that.
[97:16.81]Hold on, I'm picking flowers.
[97:21.12]I mean, this is really important, but... It actually kind of is because we need health.
[97:24.54]I don't see... I don't... What?
[97:34.20]Don't question it.
[97:37.35]Do you even need to grab onto that?
[97:40.17]Yeah.
[97:40.77]You do?
[97:41.07]Maybe.
[97:41.79]Yeah, maybe.
[97:50.07]Alright, let's go get that sniper.
[97:56.46]Why wouldn't he just shoot us while we're climbing up when we're really vulnerable?
[97:59.68]Because he's using a bow and arrow to snipe people.
[98:02.16]No.
[98:03.02]It's very challenging.
[98:06.41]And he doesn't know we're here because we've been very stealthy.
[98:11.08]Oh shit, now we... Every character in this game has betrayed us.
[98:23.46]Literally every NPC introduced is our enemy.
[98:29.38]Everybody's an enemy.
[98:30.40]Ow!
[98:36.95]Okay, now she gets a choice.
[98:41.46]Leave him or help him.
[98:45.18]And then she decides to help us and she pulls the arrow out.
[98:47.34]It's in the ground.
[98:50.54]What?
[98:51.80]It went through the... Whoa.
[98:53.52]I thought she was going to smash into the wall.
[99:01.35]Can you imagine if she just went Wile E. Coyote style directly into the side of the building?
[99:06.33]Why don't they do that shit?
[99:08.45]Do that.
[99:09.45]Have her just mess up and smash into the wall and explode into blood.
[99:13.48]That would be, like, kind of funny.
[99:15.06]I feel like they'd be like, holy shit, that's crazy what just happened.
[99:19.00]Yeah, I don't think she likes you.
[99:24.77]That sounded personal.
[99:28.80]I'm chasing after her.
[99:30.60]I'm gonna get her.
[99:31.36]Borderlands?
[99:31.94]Yeah.
[99:32.24]And then after... And then after it happens, you hear... There ain't no rest for the wicked.
[99:37.35]Money don't grow on trees.
[99:38.67]I got bills to pay.
[99:39.63]I got... There ain't nothing in this life for free.
[99:54.36]And then that guy goes... Oh, stranger.
[100:00.25]You don't think that I was going to leave you on the side of the road.
[100:03.29]Don't hit me.
[100:05.69]I jumped off the building.
[100:20.69]I'm dead.
[100:21.59]Wow, you dead.
[100:22.59]The fucking immunity stuff down here.
[100:26.21]Oh, fuck.
[100:27.47]It's two seconds.
[100:28.99]Oh, no.
[100:29.53]What the fuck?
[100:30.29]I'm immune.
[100:31.59]All this sludge on the floor, dude.
[100:35.61]We need to get out of here.
[100:51.09]This sludge won't let us... Oh, we're going to the next area.
[100:53.37]We're doing it.
[100:54.01]Here, watch this jump.
[100:55.25]Watch this jump.
[100:56.05]360.
[100:56.07]What am I watching?
[101:22.66]You're watching two bros playing a game together, having a good time, and messing around.
[101:26.66]We talk about all kinds of things here.
[101:29.26]We talk about the state of the industry.
[101:31.56]We talk about the state of gaming.
[101:33.66]We talk about all kinds of fun stuff.
[101:35.44]We talk about McDonald's orders.
[101:40.48]So what's your McDonald's order?
[101:41.88]Double cheeseburger, two of them.
[101:43.08]10-piece nugget.
[101:47.17]You think you really need two?
[101:52.96]Are we actually going to the new area?
[101:54.87]Yeah.
[102:01.17]Um... What just... I swear to God, if that hurt me, I'd be mad.
[102:08.57]Shit, do we have to get up this bridge?
[102:11.01]Uh, I don't know.
[102:12.83]Looking at my map... Uh, we may have to get up to... Yeah, we may have to be getting up to the top of this bridge somehow.
[102:21.68]Um...
[102:24.60]I see.
[102:25.38]I see where to go.
[102:27.50]You gotta use your width a little bit when you're doing some hardcore parkour.
[102:31.20]Yeah, I order French fries.
[102:32.55]That's part of the nugget bill.
[102:34.17]You get a 10 piece nugget meal and then two double cheeseburgers.
[102:37.87]It's pretty much it.
[102:39.49]What's your opinion on fries that are not sweet potato fries?
[102:42.53]I think sweet potato fries are disgusting.
[102:50.30]Because every place does them and they're always like mushy and like kind of weird and gross.
[102:57.78]And their normal fries aren't mushy from that same place.
[103:05.85]No, they are.
[103:06.75]But I would rather have mushy regular fries than mushy sweet potato fries.
[103:12.63]Locked.
[103:13.45]Sweet potato fries need to be good or I don't want them.
[103:20.97]But like normal fries are so bad that you're just used to them being a little gross.
[103:25.67]Well, because normal fries are an applicator for some type of condiment, whether that's ketchup or like a mushy normal fry.
[103:34.40]You can do ketchup.
[103:35.18]You can do like mustard, mayo, cheese.
[103:38.16]It doesn't matter what it is.
[103:39.28]Sweet potato fries.
[103:40.98]I don't, that doesn't taste right with like honey mustard or like ketchup or I don't like it.
[103:46.30]It just tastes kind of different.
[103:49.70]so you're faulting sweet potato fries for being delicious on their own without any additives yeah but that's the problem is they have to be really good for me to want to eat them on their own because I don't dip like sweet potato fries in ketchup mushy regular shitty fries taste good because you put them into like ketchup or mustard or whatever anything I like sweet potato fries if they're good on their own
[104:21.20]I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[104:22.38]I'm getting too upset.
[104:23.14]The GRE tunnel.
[104:28.64]Oh, this is like the dangerous in like in the tunnels.
[104:30.72]All the zombies are in the tunnels.
[104:31.94]This is like real dangerous.
[104:40.19]It's level 6.
[104:40.55]Not anymore.
[104:46.24]Talking about sweet potato fries.
[104:47.72]No, they're good.
[104:48.38]I mean, I like sweet potatoes.
[104:50.66]But they have to be good on their own, right?
[104:53.37]I don't really want them.
[104:54.55]Yeah, you don't like sweet potato fries because bad sweet potato fries are bad.
[104:59.13]And can't be fixed with ketchup or mustard.
[105:02.15]They can't be fixed.
[105:03.33]Yes.
[105:04.63]Why don't you just get good sweet potato fries?
[105:07.40]How am I supposed to know that if I've never eaten there before?
[105:12.60]What's the last meal you cooked?
[105:15.64]Oh, tough guy.
[105:17.36]Oh, look.
[105:18.08]Tough guy.
[105:19.72]Orange chicken.
[105:22.04]An orange chicken with a vegetable Ster fry.
[105:25.32]Tough guy.
[105:26.90]Okay, so, like, why don't you just, like, make your own sweet potato fries?
[105:31.89]Because that kind of... Make your own fries is already kind of hard to do anyways.
[105:37.41]You need to, like, just cut them into, like, the potato strips and then fry them up.
[105:42.67]I don't know.
[105:43.13]That's kind of...
[105:45.19]It's kind of an elaborate ordeal.
[105:47.35]Oh, you can like put them in the, oh yeah, but I don't know.
[105:50.87]It seems like a lot of work.
[105:53.67]You have to hit the potato with a tennis racket.
[105:58.95]It sounds like a Wii game.
[106:02.89]I just, I just boil, boil sweet potatoes because they're delicious and amazing by themselves and they don't need to be fried and they don't need an excess condiments.
[106:10.95]So you just.
[106:12.15]Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute.
[106:15.98]You just recently, over the last couple of years, turned into like a healthy guy.
[106:21.88]Dude!
[106:22.56]Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[106:24.54]No, don't start this.
[106:25.34]You're a vegan shit.
[106:25.98]Sweet potato fries.
[106:28.46]And you're like healthy.
[106:29.60]You're going to like the gym.
[106:31.08]You're like working out and shit.
[106:33.52]Uh-huh.
[106:34.58]Okay.
[106:35.88]Mm-hmm.
[106:37.16]I get it.
[106:37.48]Do you?
[106:40.42]Yeah, like all of a sudden, like sweet potato fries, man.
[106:42.64]They're like killer.
[106:48.69]I don't think in the 10 years that we've known each other, I don't think I've ever heard you say, do you, oh man, sweet potato fries.
[106:55.75]This is new.
[106:59.67]How many meals have we had together?
[107:01.51]At least like 30.
[107:03.01]We wouldn't normally talk about food for like six hours like this.
[107:07.63]Alright.
[107:09.15]Honest to God, like we have been talking about food or like video game zombies for a long time.
[107:15.75]It's time to change subject.
[107:20.36]Apparently this is just like what gets you going.
[107:22.36]No because you know what- what the big tip off was to me?
[107:25.36]Was when was the last time you cooked? That's how I knew this was a tip off.
[107:31.00]Well, no.
[107:31.69]This was like a okay Ster is cooking and healthy meals and-
[107:35.00]No you're talking about sweet potato fries being bad, because when they're delivered they're all soggy and you don't know if they're good or not.
[107:41.00]I didn't say delivery.
[107:43.00]The only way they're going to be soggy is if if they showed up in the delivery package.
[107:45.00]Oh he fucked it up.
[107:47.00]No oh, he fucked it up. I'll get it first try.
[107:54.78]Excuse me, sir.
[107:55.48]I'm in an emotional state right now.
[108:00.62]Okay, here we go.
[108:04.57]Are you ready?
[108:06.29]What was the last meal that you cooked at home?
[108:11.51]Tell me.
[108:18.19]It actually was sweet potato.
[108:19.89]Really?
[108:20.97]It was.
[108:21.73]What else was on it?
[108:22.89]Wait, no.
[108:23.23]Yeah, I had eggs this morning.
[108:25.09]Eggs.
[108:25.97]Nice healthy eggs.
[108:26.71]Wait, do you eat the yolk?
[108:30.64]Yeah, I put a bunch of eggs in the pan with green peppers and cheese.
[108:35.72]I was going to say, if you were removing the yolks and having egg whites and sweet potato, automatically I would win.
[108:47.70]How do you win?
[108:48.54]How is, like, me being healthy, you winning?
[108:51.10]No, because, like, if you're taking the yolks out, that's what I was looking for.
[108:54.06]But you're not doing that.
[108:54.90]Okay.
[108:57.86]Yeah, Ashley, my wife, she eats egg whites.
[109:01.32]Got a problem?
[109:02.61]No.
[109:03.21]I don't have a problem.
[109:03.73]I've got a problem with you.
[109:06.67]Why?
[109:08.95]Yolk is the best part.
[109:09.83]Yolk is where all the vitamins are.
[109:17.98]Don't eat the egg yolk.
[109:19.08]It's like propaganda.
[109:25.46]But how do you win this conversation?
[109:28.94]Because that's a really super healthy, like no cholesterol and like super foods.
[109:37.07]Yes, but like how is anyone winning this discussion?
[109:40.51]Because I'm a gamer and all things are, you know, got to be tied back to gaming.
[109:46.93]I get in a weird mood whenever you're around.
[109:51.77]I have too much fun when you are in a call.
[109:55.51]So we better just like not play anything together for like another year.
[109:58.33]Yeah.
[110:11.04]And the mood.
[110:14.67]But honest to God, though, egg yolks... Look, this... Okay, obviously, if you're trying to do low cholesterol, then egg yolks.
[110:20.40]But don't eggs have good cholesterol?
[110:23.88]Not the bad, bad one?
[110:24.86]Maybe a little bit of the... What, LD?
[110:28.18]Okay.
[110:29.95]Hold on.
[110:30.23]They're doing this fucking Ginyu Force pose.
[110:31.87]Wait, that guy... They're all mad at me.
[110:36.97]They're betraying us.
[110:38.17]What's going on?
[110:39.99]We did missions for them, and now they want to betray us.
[110:44.17]Um, so he- I'm so sick of hearing, oh, like, cholesterol's bad for you, but eggs are the good cholesterol.
[110:50.79]And there's a whole bunch of things, like, I think it's all propaganda, where if you talk about coconuts and you look online, like, are coconuts good for you?
[110:55.98]Oh, it has a lot of fat, but it's like the good fat.
[110:59.76]Like, when does the cholesterol from the eggs become good?
[111:04.10]Unsaturated fat is not... It's like a building block for everything in your whole life.
[111:08.94]Well, like, fat isn't inherently bad.
[111:11.55]No, it's not.
[111:11.97]But I'm saying, like, when I get my blood tested, my doctor's always like, oh, you're looking good, but your cholesterol is a little bit high.
[111:18.61]And I'm like, okay.
[111:20.03]So, like, is that eggs?
[111:21.77]Is that the good cholesterol?
[111:23.41]Is that the bad cholesterol?
[111:24.51]Is too much cholesterol in general a bad?
[111:26.15]Am I going to die soon?
[111:27.49]They combine it.
[111:28.84]right it's a combined so here's the thing a cholesterol is you have to understand something about cholesterol if your cholesterol is over I believe 200 which is the it's combined with your hdl and ldl right your HDMI if your HDMI is too high that like hdml um cholesterol comes from like battered fish like beer battered french fries and and like full fat saturated fat meats and stuff
[112:00.31]So good fat and like good cholesterol,
[112:05.05]We're getting ResidentSleeper again.
[112:07.77]This is your fault.
[112:09.87]Chat, whoever is resident sleepering Jerma right now, you guys are about to go eat some bad cholesterol and have an awful life.
[112:18.53]This is the one step off to live an amazing healthy life right now.
[112:22.67]You know when they interview the 95-year-old woman and they're like, oh, what did you do to live this long and live this healthy?
[112:27.81]And then you're just fucking ResidentSleeper and you don't even listen to her?
[112:33.13]Jerma's gonna outlast all of you guys because the good ones always die first what someone was here are you implying that I'm like a bad guy no I'm just saying like you know the health tips like you you're I wanted to hear this explanation I've been okay so
[112:57.39]When you have saturated fat, it means that it cannot be... Your body uses it.
[113:02.19]It can't be used.
[113:03.29]Your body uses fat.
[113:05.03]There's unsaturated fat.
[113:06.51]There's polysaturated fat, right?
[113:08.47]There's a bunch of different like kind of half saturated.
[113:10.55]Full saturated fat, your body does not use it.
[113:13.48]It's just junk that has been completely saturated.
[113:15.86]That's why it's called saturated.
[113:19.07]The reason why people say to eat peanut butter and eat, like, avocados and eat, um, like, olive oil is because it's an unsaturated fat.
[113:27.12]Okay, yeah, but what about the cholesterol?
[113:31.80]What do you want to know about it?
[113:34.90]How is egg cholesterol good?
[113:37.24]Okay.
[113:38.14]Let me look this up.
[113:38.86]LDL cholesterol.
[113:51.79]Yeah, what about Hillary's cholesterol?
[113:53.69]Low density cholesterol is one of the five major groups of lipoprotein which transport all fat molecules around the body in an extraterrestrial water.
[114:05.54]Oh, the cosmic fluid.
[114:06.54]So that's the stuff that flows your blood.
[114:08.24]Look, do you understand how fucked up our bodies are?
[114:10.16]Do you understand how complicated it is and how we even know any of this?
[114:15.05]Yeah.
[114:18.77]Our bodies are insane.
[114:21.96]You have a thing in your body that pumps blood oxygen shit across your whole body.
[114:27.36]Do you really need to know why this all works?
[114:30.90]Yeah.
[114:34.04]I just want to know.
[114:34.74]I guess at the end of the conversation.
[114:38.34]We have to go through this door.
[114:39.14]I made eggs this morning.
[114:40.02]I made myself eggs this morning.
[114:41.54]Does that count?
[114:43.08]Or like making eggs beneath you.
[114:44.76]Do you make eggs?
[114:45.34]What do you have for breakfast?
[114:46.54]I love eggs.
[114:47.22]Eggs are like one of my favorite breakfast foods.
[114:49.02]Yes.
[114:50.14]I have no idea what we're doing.
[114:51.36]Follow the traces.
[114:52.20]They lead to the door and then the guys like this door is stupid.
[114:54.84]Underneath in the water, maybe?
[115:03.20]The cholesterol is not necessarily a bad thing, but too much of it fills up like plaque in your arteries.
[115:13.21]Wait, we can go up here.
[115:15.31]In the vent.
[115:19.99]Ah, the secret vent.
[115:25.54]One of my favorite things is hard-boiled eggs.
[115:27.94]Because, especially when I used to work out a lot.
[115:30.92]Don't really do it anymore, but you know, whatever.
[115:33.94]Hard-boiled eggs were so easy, because I would just make like two dozen of them.
[115:39.80]And I would just take them out.
[115:41.40]Like an hour or two.
[115:43.63]What?
[115:44.15]Me?
[115:46.27]You?
[115:48.52]Um, so I would make, like, 12, I would buy a carton of eggs, and I would make a, uh, boil them up, hard-boiled eggs, put them in a container, and I would eat two or three of them every day.
[116:01.65]And then I would go to the gym, and I would utilize that fat and protein, and they were really, really easy.
[116:06.51]So you would eat eggs before you went to the gym?
[116:11.24]Like, maybe an hour, a couple hours before, an hour before.
[116:13.26]That's kind of weird.
[116:15.96]I also used to eat tuna out of the can, like a cat.
[116:19.54]Okay, that's a little weirder.
[116:24.77]Like I would just open the thing and just like drain the water and just eat it.
[116:31.77]Like it was cat food.
[116:32.58]Who is this guy?
[116:33.80]I don't know, but he's holding his hands in a really weird place.
[116:43.84]He's got a knife back there.
[116:44.96]He's hiding.
[116:46.02]His thumbs are like in front of his neck.
[116:47.78]It's kind of weird.
[116:49.92]Yeah.
[116:50.26]Sardines.
[116:50.64]Yeah, sardines are really good too.
[116:51.82]You're not enjoying your new role.
[116:57.63]New status.
[116:58.69]New challenges.
[117:00.03]New possum.
[117:01.77]I was on a kick for a long time of eating like a tin of sardines like a couple times a week.
[117:08.50]I'm glad you finally joined us.
[117:10.46]Now, give back what you stole from me.
[117:14.68]Give back the key, boy, or you will all die.
[117:19.60]Oh, this broke his hand.
[117:21.96]It's Wesker.
[117:30.22]Nice flip.
[117:30.88]Nice.
[117:32.16]Ooh.
[117:38.18]I was just watching.
[117:40.34]I'm going to pay for what you've done.
[117:44.18]I hope this guy is a face turn, right?
[117:49.26]Seven minutes.
[118:00.55]Seven minutes is all I can spare for you.
[118:06.71]You guys like that video?
[118:07.39]The video was exactly seven minutes long.
[118:10.53]I love that video.
[118:11.85]It's honestly incredible.
[118:15.26]the thought that goes into these things.
[118:16.84]What about locks on a bagel?
[118:25.56]I have to really be in the mood for, um, smoked salmon.
[118:32.60]That person's a little different.
[118:37.05]Let's kill him.
[118:39.01]Um, so we fight these people?
[118:42.05]Yeah, we fight these people.
[118:48.15]He's killing me.
[118:50.37]What?
[118:50.61]I'm in goon vision.
[118:52.15]Oh, my God.
[118:53.15]I hit that guy's torso off.
[118:56.73]What the fuck?
[118:57.23]Did the game crash?
[119:09.88]What the hell?
[119:11.50]No.
[119:13.36]My head is pounding.
[119:17.06]What's happening to me?
[119:20.10]What happened here?
[119:25.09]You still there?
[119:26.05]Yeah.
[119:28.29]He's in the car factory.
[119:30.95]Okay, now we got to hunt down Wesker.
[119:33.39]Get back.
[119:33.97]Okay, so now let's follow Walt.
[119:36.52]So I think we're going to get a major encounter here, a major boss maybe.
[119:40.85]Yeah, the whole world's opening up.
[119:41.93]We're out of the tutorial now.
[119:43.05]So we have the same powers as him is what I'm getting here.
[119:48.11]That seems to be the case that we were experimenting on when we were children and we were with our friend Mia and we want to find her again.
[119:56.45]And she's going to be the key to we're all actually the new infested are the people that were together.
[120:06.00]This looks cool.
[120:12.63]Eat tuna out of the can on stream.
[120:14.33]I'm not going to do that.
[120:15.55]It was just really easy and really fast.
[120:17.05]Especially if you were working out a lot.
[120:32.20]Oh my god, I almost just fell through.
[120:43.13]oh god oh shit I saw you do that and I freaked out and now I'm gonna fall I thought that you did you fall you said alright I mean I'll continue forward I suppose I heard you say oh god and I saw you fall so I was like wait maybe I'm doing this wrong
[121:16.45]I'm coming.
[121:19.80]Let's go, Borpo.
[121:21.56]I'm coming.
[121:24.28]Yeah, I'm sorry that you falling was my fault.
[121:26.94]Well, no, you jumped in the air.
[121:28.70]I heard, oh God.
[121:29.87]Yeah, because of me.
[121:34.71]That's fucked up.
[121:35.37]I would do that to you.
[121:37.87]So, let me see here.
[121:42.52]Hey, lockpick.
[121:44.42]We need some meds.
[121:47.05]I actually do need to craft a medkit.
[121:54.75]These bandages are starting to not be enough for me anymore.
[121:57.18]I've got so much... I'm so vascular.
[122:00.94]So much blood.
[122:02.04]Oh, fuck that.
[122:03.66]What?
[122:05.28]I didn't get the pick.
[122:07.82]Oh.
[122:09.19]Dude, what is it with this one?
[122:10.93]I thought you were reacting to vascular men.
[122:16.17]Got it.
[122:18.58]Are you guys going to complete the entire game?
[122:20.38]No.
[122:21.74]Yeah, I think in the next hour or so.
[122:25.62]Ster definitely is at that point where he's like starting to get a little bored.
[122:30.25]Oh, it's me.
[122:30.85]It's me again.
[122:31.49]Bringing up like sweet potatoes and food and they got Gundam.
[122:37.69]He said something about Gundams, like a Gundam photo, whatever it was.
[122:40.52]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[122:47.34]And we just got to the big the big city out here.
[122:52.85]And that's good.
[122:56.65]Wait.
[123:01.47]Cool.
[123:05.32]Hey, we got Peds.
[123:08.82]Is it solar?
[123:10.70]Yeah.
[123:13.44]Cool.
[123:14.92]Watch out Peds.
[123:17.63]I want to craft a bomb or something.
[123:20.37]I think I got a bomb.
[123:23.19]Oh, they've heard us.
[123:24.15]Car factory.
[123:25.59]There it is.
[123:25.95]Alright.
[123:26.69]What do you got?
[123:27.29]Bomb?
[123:34.81]No, no.
[123:35.23]You didn't jump and kick them.
[123:38.03]Now he's dead.
[123:41.19]You just put like shrapnel in his eyeballs, but you didn't kick him.
[123:46.87]That's my bad.
[123:47.55]I should have jumped and kicked him.
[123:55.38]Tahini paste?
[123:58.56]No, but that was like... I do not recommend that.
[124:00.90]That's probably not that great for you, to be honest.
[124:16.55]Ooh, spear.
[124:18.93]Nice.
[124:20.29]Is that thing going to blow?
[124:26.44]Yeah.
[124:27.46]I speared right through the metal container with my incredible strength.
[124:36.04]Come on, come on, come on.
[124:39.97]Come on.
[124:48.69]When does Elden Ring come out?
[124:50.49]Like, really soon, right?
[124:54.49]Hey, hey, hey.
[124:55.27]He's putting his hands up.
[124:56.25]He wants us to stop.
[124:58.70]I thought you were serious for a second.
[125:02.62]I am.
[125:08.11]Don't.
[125:09.11]Thursday of next week.
[125:10.07]Damn.
[125:10.45]Okay.
[125:15.55]How come there aren't more suplexes in video games?
[125:19.93]I agree.
[125:20.53]That's actually not a bad point.
[125:26.04]I think because you have to make the models match up, and it depends on which character, and it's a whole... There was a suplex mod for all the Skyrim games.
[125:35.97]The Scrolls of Skyrim.
[125:37.65]And it would always desync weird and give you this crazy kill cam, but that's what made it enjoyable.
[125:44.61]He's in here somewhere.
[125:45.41]Can we go up?
[125:49.89]I think we just keep going around.
[126:00.27]Wait, are you still inside?
[126:01.49]I'm out.
[126:03.04]No.
[126:04.56]Oh.
[126:08.46]Yeah, maybe we did still have to be in there.
[126:13.08]Auto plant.
[126:14.90]Let's go back in.
[126:17.92]These doors feel like they would lead there, but they're fake doors.
[126:21.90]I think we can... Oh, we can climb.
[126:24.76]Oh, we can climb.
[126:28.19]It looks like you can.
[126:33.31]How do we climb?
[126:37.33]Oh, I see.
[126:38.01]There we go.
[126:38.71]This way.
[126:39.53]Oh, you just skipped it.
[126:42.36]It's like, are you guys having fun?
[126:44.44]No?
[126:46.65]Not really.
[126:50.35]Wait, how did you get up there?
[126:54.25]I jumped.
[126:55.63]Okay.
[126:59.61]Then, oh, I gotta go from here to here?
[127:04.80]Oh, fuck off.
[127:06.02]Please.
[127:08.58]Come on.
[127:10.65]Just give it to him, game.
[127:12.21]I seriously got there.
[127:13.53]I was so dumb.
[127:14.45]I'm gonna wait up for my bud.
[127:25.98]Thanks, man.
[127:27.54]My sweet potato bud.
[127:39.82]Alright.
[127:40.66]Where's he at?
[127:42.44]No, I'm kidding.
[127:42.96]We're having a good time.
[127:43.62]It's fun.
[127:43.86]Are you telling jokes?
[127:47.77]Somebody asked if we were having a good time, and I said no.
[127:51.87]What's the punchline?
[127:53.61]There isn't.
[127:54.03]I was making... I was just lying.
[128:00.20]Yeah.
[128:00.92]A lie is the punchline.
[128:02.38]Okay.
[128:02.78]So... Is this him?
[128:16.02]I'm just swinging.
[128:26.62]We should play Fart Simulator 2004.
[128:28.70]For some reason, I feel like I'm wasting my valuable time.
[128:37.60]I mean, your time is pretty valuable, right?
[128:39.44]Like, if there's something else you could be doing, maybe...
[128:46.91]Sorry, he accidentally just snorted some coke.
[128:48.55]He's got like an Abraham Lincoln vibe.
[128:53.85]On one of his experiments.
[129:07.17]Good.
[129:08.29]Before I kill you, you'll get a chance to witness something spectacular.
[129:13.33]Oh my God, his pants are coming off.
[129:16.89]He's got... Everything comes full circle.
[129:19.81]We return to the beginning.
[129:21.99]Ethan.
[129:23.26]Hi, Ethan.
[129:23.76]And now, you will witness history in the making.
[129:28.22]You don't understand anything, Ethan.
[129:30.64]I'm gonna kill you right now, Ethan.
[129:34.38]You had a chance, Ethan.
[129:36.46]You were part of something greater.
[129:38.62]You owe it to me that you are still alive.
[129:41.66]That you are stronger than others.
[129:43.40]Special.
[129:44.11]That you are stronger than I could have imagined.
[129:47.07]Yet not as strong as me.
[129:48.75]That's too red.
[129:49.69]Any last words?
[129:50.95]What have you done to my sister?
[129:53.71]Sister?
[130:02.68]What?
[130:03.18]Wait.
[130:04.50]Oh, betrayed.
[130:05.82]Instantly betrayed.
[130:07.24]Hey, we're friends.
[130:07.76]I got shot by an arrow.
[130:09.40]It's dad.
[130:15.80]What?
[130:17.54]The double, double cross.
[130:24.21]Father Gascoigne, let's go.
[130:27.51]No, we should have watched that.
[130:28.65]That's the one time we should have paid attention.
[130:30.01]Nope.
[130:32.99]Is he coming?
[130:33.75]Is he chasing us?
[130:35.19]I mean, I won't spend skill points, so.
[130:38.79]Wait, that's not even him.
[130:40.87]This must be him.
[130:48.86]Where?
[130:49.62]Oh, in the window?
[130:50.22]Oh, it's just some random dude.
[130:52.76]Yeah, that's a renegade.
[131:07.90]We got to go.
[131:08.62]Okay, let's go.
[131:09.70]We got to go.
[131:10.70]It's too dangerous here.
[131:14.28]I hope so bad that all of a sudden we hear in the distance.
[131:17.08]The cutscene ends, run across the street, and we're going to start it again.
[131:34.23]What?
[131:40.87]Okay, Tony Soprano was cooking over here.
[131:44.49]He got angry at the grill not starting Okay, I think you skipped something really important Wait what happened I have no idea didn't we go in this door I?
[132:10.04]I think we're trying to catch her.
[132:13.80]But she was on my screen.
[132:15.88]This is an indicator over here.
[132:19.04]Escape from Waltz.
[132:20.40]Wait, is this Waltz here?
[132:24.17]We have to go.
[132:24.63]You just locked us out of the room.
[132:36.71]Wait, how did we go in that door last time?
[132:40.17]My chat's saying a softlock.
[132:41.51]I mean, we're here.
[132:42.95]Maybe.
[132:47.35]Get the fuck out of there.
[132:48.35]He did it.
[132:55.77]Okay, here we are.
[132:56.88]I can't fit through this.
[133:10.83]There's gotta be a way to get out.
[133:15.94]Wait, is this to go down here now?
[133:19.98]I think we progressed it somehow.
[133:27.32]We slide through here?
[133:30.62]Yeah, try to jump out now.
[133:35.94]This is... Uh...
[133:43.94]Okay.
[133:44.74]We can't get in there.
[133:45.34]I think we have to die.
[133:48.07]I'm in.
[133:48.97]Wait.
[133:49.65]He's on the map now for me.
[133:53.15]What is going on?
[133:54.03]I'm at her.
[133:56.89]Okay.
[133:57.15]I'm going to do that.
[133:59.65]I'm going to go backwards and try and get like a trigger.
[134:02.70]He was just on the screen.
[134:05.36]Okay.
[134:05.64]I got her.
[134:06.02]I got her.
[134:08.06]Something's happening.
[134:08.56]We're going to go this way.
[134:24.38]Wait, there she is.
[134:31.60]I needed that.
[134:32.47]Bro.
[134:33.03]Just grab it.
[134:33.61]Grab the top.
[134:34.21]You gotta jump.
[134:34.83]You gotta jump.
[134:35.35]You grab it at the same time.
[134:36.43]Alright, finally.
[134:42.65]Here we are.
[134:51.57]Why did she say here and then shut the door?
[134:55.72]I think we got it.
[135:04.93]Flashlights on.
[135:09.17]Oh, that's him.
[135:09.77]He's literally here.
[135:11.25]We actually get to see him now.
[135:13.99]Oh, he's right behind me.
[135:15.82]Dude, you're about to get westward.
[135:17.06]How many grenades?
[135:19.98]I got some coins.
[135:37.03]I don't know what's happening.
[135:38.27]That guy had no idea where we went, by the way.
[135:42.68]Not a clue.
[135:58.06]What?
[135:59.87]He's not behind us.
[136:03.65]What is...
[136:06.49]I can't swim!
[136:07.27]What do you mean you can't swim?
[136:10.37]Are you alright?
[136:11.91]No, I can't swim.
[136:17.50]Did you just drown?
[136:23.50]I think he's supposed to be behind us constantly, but he's not.
[136:29.09]This is supposed to be very scary.
[136:30.17]Oh, there he is.
[136:30.77]There he is.
[136:31.65]Oh, there he is.
[136:35.14]Wait, he doesn't know where... Oh, shit.
[136:37.56]He found me.
[136:43.00]He's right behind me.
[136:53.26]Oh, shit.
[136:53.66]He's right behind me.
[136:59.86]This is... I don't know what... Where'd you go?
[137:01.90]Where'd you go?
[137:02.28]Where'd you go?
[137:02.88]He's behind me.
[137:04.24]I'm dead.
[137:06.14]I don't think you matter.
[137:15.39]I don't.
[137:16.71]I actually don't matter.
[137:26.16]So why don't I just distract him?
[137:31.40]You just have to get there.
[137:32.26]It doesn't matter what happens to me.
[137:33.78]Dude, you don't see what I'm seeing either.
[137:35.56]This lady just keeps disappearing and teleporting.
[137:38.47]This whole thing has been a fever dream.
[137:40.69]There he is again.
[137:42.71]He got me.
[137:43.63]He got you.
[137:44.05]Wait, I can get you.
[137:44.59]I can help you.
[137:44.95]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[137:57.70]What the fuck?
[137:58.76]What happened?
[138:01.38]he died so that I could live I gotta make it out of here for the both of us he was just looking at us the music I did not make the jump to this ladder by the way I had to shoot you to keep up appearances
[138:31.79]Um... See, I'm not infected.
[138:36.75]Well, hers does not light up.
[138:58.65]Where did you go?
[138:59.55]I am you.
[139:22.85]Right?
[139:24.35]Um, alright.
[139:27.77]So, he's still chasing us.
[139:34.72]Okay, he's still on the map.
[139:35.90]Okay.
[139:39.30]Oh, we gotta follow the sniper.
[139:43.32]She won't tell us her name.
[139:44.20]Because her name's Mia.
[139:46.59]Okay.
[139:50.43]Come on.
[139:50.95]I'm coming.
[139:51.85]Hmm.
[140:19.90]Let's try to stay human.
[140:21.58]So Wendy's!
[140:47.50]Number one.
[140:48.84]You got a hit list.
[140:49.90]You got a hit list.
[140:51.14]Seriously.
[140:52.40]Do I look like I'm kidding?
[140:53.78]The city's got a lot of trash.
[140:55.26]Yeah.
[140:55.88]Who else is on it?
[140:57.38]Besides Waltz, Butcher, Hackon and.
[141:00.88]Oh, wait.
[141:01.74]Hackon.
[141:03.38]There's a few.
[141:04.97]She's the one who shot him, dude.
[141:07.07]He got.
[141:08.93]We got it.
[141:10.07]Yeah.
[141:10.51]When are they going to reveal that?
[141:11.49]That's Mia.
[141:13.45]I'm not going to.
[141:26.35]I mean, sniper is sort of weird, right?
[141:32.65]Like, sniper.
[141:35.23]It's gonna be a reveal.
[141:36.07]I don't know if it's gonna be Mia, though.
[141:38.33]Why wouldn't it be?
[141:39.05]Who else could it be that we know the name of that they would be hiding the name?
[141:42.23]When otherwise, these Ubisoft-style games are like, we want you to know who our kooky zany characters are.
[141:49.23]This is Zilpo, the fucking, the goofy, you know what I'm talking about.
[141:54.02]Zilpo?
[141:54.20]Yeah.
[141:57.88]Zilpo.
[141:58.54]No.
[141:59.48]I like those blue puppets that be dancing.
[142:08.38]That my dear is alone.
[142:09.70]Let's just say everyone on that list.
[142:14.36]Where did you get that?
[142:15.74]Don't worry, I can handle this.
[142:17.94]Yeah, but you know, Dylan, he's dead.
[142:19.74]Dylan Waltz.
[142:22.39]Also, maybe we were meant to meet.
[142:25.07]Good boy.
[142:26.55]Dylan wanted to contact Frank.
[142:27.81]What?
[142:27.91]I'm pissed.
[142:28.15]Okay, PK Commander Lucas.
[142:35.16]He wanted to escape the city so that Waltz wouldn't get it.
[142:38.26]EK.
[142:40.04]I have it now.
[142:41.70]Pastor!
[142:42.46]For Waltz, then Vallejo, I suppose.
[142:46.93]EK, please!
[142:48.91]Now, what's going on?
[142:52.27]Waltz must have switched on the generators.
[142:56.22]Who knows what's in that box?
[142:57.68]Come on.
[143:02.78]Let's wall.

[143:13.17]Oh, yeah, man.

[144:13.50]The Lord of the Rings when they say, and my axe, and my sword, and my bow.
[144:18.80]When they say, like, at the Fellowship of the Ring, yes, we're going to work together.
[144:23.02]And you made a song about this moment.
[144:24.95]And you sing in my moment.
[144:25.77]That's what I do.
[144:26.87]I make songs.
[144:28.45]I make little jingles.
[144:29.63]That's what I do here.
[144:30.77]We're sightseeing.
[144:32.95]I thought you did like... Fuck.
[144:38.01]I thought you did nunchucks.
[144:53.27]What is going on?
[144:54.17]I don't know.
[145:00.81]We're getting like Nick Fury just walked in the room.
[145:06.46]That's the same soundtrack.
[145:08.78]See what?
[145:10.28]What's going on?
[145:11.00]Hey, where are you?
[145:13.58]I'm coming, Mia.
[145:16.30]Yeah, I don't go by Mia anymore.
[145:17.92]That was the name that they gave me.
[145:24.51]I'm still holding on to it.
[145:29.65]I think we've opened up the game.
[145:31.39]I was wrong.
[145:32.85]Can't see shit.
[145:38.45]I'm to unlock the best part of the game.
[145:40.00]Really?
[145:41.48]Well, at least it's peaceful.
[145:45.42]Yeah, so look.
[145:52.86]Electricity!
[145:53.84]Chicken pie.
[145:56.69]I could go for some chicken pie.
[146:17.35]Hey, what happened?
[146:18.05]You skipped too fast
[146:31.18]So that's the fish eye, okay?
[146:32.33]How do we get there?
[146:34.59]The power just went out again.
[146:38.17]Somebody's like, what they didn't realize is that they only had it on a few fuses.
[146:41.71]Somebody just fucking microwaved a bag of popcorn and just fucking turned the whole thing off.
[146:44.99]Give us the paraglider.
[146:45.87]We're paragliders.
[146:46.79]Hold Z to open the paraglider.
[146:48.47]Hold Z, press S. Oh, baby!
[146:54.12]Here we go!
[147:00.79]What?
[147:01.05]Are you going to really do this to me?
[147:02.83]You're leaving the mission area?
[147:05.65]I won't go forward.
[147:10.11]That wasn't a paraglider.
[147:11.77]That was like a parachute.
[147:19.85]Press S to stabilize.
[147:20.97]What do you mean?
[147:21.43]What are you talking about?
[147:22.65]How am I leaving the mission area?
[147:24.82]Because you're going too low.
[147:25.92]You got to press S. It's teaching you to press S. It's like, hey, press S right now.
[147:35.98]Oh, cool.
[147:40.26]We unlocked it.
[147:40.88]We got it.
[147:41.22]Let's go.
[147:47.82]Hey, meet me down here.
[147:48.86]Oh, gas can.
[147:50.52]What?
[147:52.34]I'm down a little bit.
[147:54.06]Why did you tell me to come down here?
[147:56.72]Well, this is the objective, but you landed high and I'm not good enough to do that.
[148:00.43]The objective is up there.
[148:01.39]You have to talk to Mia.
[148:03.21]Yeah, I'm talking to Mia.
[148:04.71]Just talk to her and get the fuck out of this.
[148:06.09]I fell.
[148:08.45]I can teleport you.
[148:12.01]I was... Come on.
[148:20.68]Come on.
[148:22.72]Come on.
[148:23.32]Come on, dude.
[148:24.10]That was almost bad.
[148:26.51]How do you get up and get dressed in the morning?
[148:28.19]I just rip open my closet and just grab and just like rip shit off the hangers and rip the shirts and stuff and smush it all over my face and smush it and rub all over my face until it gets on me.
[148:38.40]He still has his mommy do it.
[148:42.26]I've seen it.
[148:44.60]Using air vents.
[148:46.02]Yeah, okay, yeah, the air vents are pumping so hard.
[148:48.66]I just roll around on the ground until it gets on one arm.
[148:53.24]Yeah, fly into the vents.
[149:07.72]not saying the thing that Mario does when he jumps off the edge of a level you can't fall off of what does he say come on you know what he says oh wow oh my god are you kidding me uh is that not what he says it wasn't even close
[149:36.95]Hey, let me help you.
[149:37.43]I'll do the sound effect.
[149:38.81]Okay.
[149:43.91]What?
[149:49.97]What the fuck was that?
[149:53.63]It was like in a horror movie where like your phone starts going static because the ghost is nearby.
[150:07.66]she have one of these things way better yeah she goes first but you have to control the wind otherwise it controls you okay okay show us okay show us what it means to fly ah good joke what did you do nothing
[150:45.14]I don't know how to control this you need to control the wind oh no I was gonna come save you okay here we go oh by the way I just want to let you know your weapon's almost broken where are we going okay now she's going
[151:14.50]Here we go.
[151:14.88]Control the wind.
[151:15.58]There.
[151:16.74]Oh, you get stamina when you go over that shit.
[151:21.58]If we could collide in the air, that would be kind of funny.
[151:25.70]Is there a break?
[151:26.38]How do you get off?
[151:27.16]Like, what's break?
[151:27.86]What's break?
[151:28.38]I don't know what break is.
[151:29.12]How do I just stop?
[151:29.50]Crouch.
[151:29.78]Crouch.
[151:30.22]Crouch.
[151:30.58]Is it actually crouch?
[151:31.34]Are you making that up?
[151:32.20]Yeah, it's actually crouch.
[151:34.18]Alright, we'll just hit the button.
[151:41.72]you're back soon I got here before you well you did super gun on your hang glider but have you ever done it this way okay we're going somewhere to activate that's what she sounds like what I can make fun of her she's my sister activate the electrical substation
[152:10.51]So you said C is break.
[152:12.17]C is let go.
[152:14.67]You said it was break.
[152:16.63]I didn't say break.
[152:17.61]You can't break something that is guided by the wind.
[152:20.80]You can tilt it the other way so it fills the air.
[152:23.76]You go backwards so it fills it up.
[152:27.06]The air pushes into the big balloon shit.
[152:30.16]You tilt it up so the air slows you down.
[152:32.27]This is a video game.
[152:48.54]I think you have to get enough speed, and when you have the owl hat with the tail, then you jump with the cape.
[152:55.36]Can I not climb this?
[152:59.11]Dude, there's zeds in here.
[152:59.89]Is there a vent right here?
[153:00.63]Yeah, there is right there.
[153:01.67]There's vents down here, and yeah, there's zeds up here.
[153:05.07]So I could really use some help.
[153:06.39]Oh my god, damn it.
[153:10.30]Someone is crying for help.
[153:18.30]I have to go around.
[153:20.52]I haven't figured it out yet.
[153:22.84]This isn't even where we're going.
[153:24.81]It's not?
[153:25.93]No.
[153:27.35]It's a building over this way.
[153:32.27]Let me just turn.
[153:37.94]Please.
[153:38.80]Look, I've got to turn the right way.
[153:40.14]Are you a night runner?
[153:42.18]Me?
[153:42.26]Night runner?
[153:47.91]I'm holding S. Just relax.
[153:49.67]Somebody's pressing that button.
[153:51.27]Yeah, I hear him.
[153:51.89]It's fine.
[153:52.41]I'm ignoring him.
[153:53.09]I'm stealth killing the zombies.
[154:15.59]I'm something of an assassin.
[154:18.73]Are you up higher?
[154:22.02]There's an... Yeah, I'm right here.
[154:24.52]Oh, there you are.
[154:30.32]Finally, level three enemies.
[154:33.78]New crafting recipe.
[154:34.75]Okay, fuck.
[154:45.51]Okay, where are we going?
[154:46.11]We're going down.
[154:46.55]You kind of feel like... So, we've been waiting for this.
[154:49.97]I feel like we just did... We waited in line at Disney World for, like, three hours to go on Soarin'.
[154:57.02]And, like, the ride is now over.
[154:59.80]It was, like, fucking two minutes, three minutes.
[155:02.16]And I don't care anymore.
[155:04.92]You don't care anymore?
[155:05.76]Like, we just rode the ride that we were waiting for.
[155:09.69]Yeah.
[155:12.13]You know, they, like, spray... They, like, spray scents in your nose.
[155:16.06]What?
[155:17.14]You never gone on Sorin before?
[155:18.50]Yeah, that guy kind of looks like you.
[155:20.27]Who's Sorin?
[155:20.59]Who are these guys?
[155:21.17]I don't know, but apparently we're fighting them.
[155:23.51]I'm going to drop kick them.
[155:45.46]I think the guy behind you is also mad at you.
[155:54.07]They're all doing the stuntman in a movie from the 90s.
[155:56.70]They have like eight articles of clothing on.
[156:13.55]This guy actually is not.
[156:14.57]We have to talk to him now.
[156:15.53]Now they're not fighting anymore.
[156:16.77]Wait, don't they're not?
[156:17.61]Okay.
[156:19.71]Over here.
[156:20.05]The guy that's engulfed in flames that's walking around like a toddler.
[156:23.50]Because he's wearing like five flame like suits on.
[156:28.32]Can you come over here?
[156:34.90]I'm trying to take the story seriously.
[156:36.32]I'm invested in the characters now that Wesker's in the game.
[156:39.16]What is it?
[156:39.70]You're Swiss cheese.
[156:40.26]You're dead.
[156:40.60]Just pass through.
[156:41.64]Bang, bang.
[156:41.90]Wait, what was it?
[156:43.12]What did the bullet say to the man that got shot?
[156:45.21]Come on, man.
[157:02.52]You severed his limbs with a machete, Netaf.
[157:04.96]Technically speaking, that's a melee weapon.
[157:06.94]While bullets are reserved for... I'm glad you're fine, too.
[157:11.25]Bullets?
[157:12.81]You still want to climb up there, Aiden?
[157:14.67]Not for free, of course.
[157:16.23]We reward specialists.
[157:18.69]If you need... What are we looking at?
[157:24.33]We're climbing up the building.
[157:26.33]And I think we're doing the unlock the front door for the people.
[157:30.64]Okay.
[157:32.57]Let's get up there.
[157:32.95]But we need to go around and figure out how to get up there.
[157:34.92]I think, can we just run up here like this and go... I don't think so.
[157:43.90]Why is it telling me to press F?
[157:52.25]I think you did it.
[157:52.79]Yep.
[157:57.75]How'd you do that?
[158:00.43]I don't know.
[158:01.11]How's it look?
[158:02.55]Somebody was in a big hurry when they took it offline.
[158:04.85]Someone inside the building.
[158:06.01]I would surmise the main circuit suffered a break.
[158:09.11]Find a cable and connect the source of power to the transmitter.
[158:12.97]That should restore the circuit.
[158:14.30]There's like a whole thing going on in here now.
[158:19.24]There's like a whole tutorial.
[158:20.92]I'm on top of the substation.
[158:23.90]Trying to connect power to the transmitter.
[158:27.30]Always another tutorial.
[158:32.95]Oh, what?
[158:33.71]Is it connected to you?
[158:39.01]Yeah.
[158:39.53]Okay, so what do you bring?
[158:40.45]I got a release cable button.
[158:42.65]Alright, so now what we have to do is we have to literally make a mess and drag that across the whole game.
[158:46.71]It's got a distance.
[158:47.51]Oh.
[158:47.61]It can only go like 17 meters.
[158:57.84]I thought we were in America.
[158:58.92]Where are you supposed to bring it?
[159:01.16]I can't go.
[159:01.48]I'm stuck.
[159:01.72]It's probably like right here though.
[159:03.62]Oh, no, no.
[159:03.96]I think it's right here.
[159:05.86]It's right across the way.
[159:07.00]Yeah, it's right here.
[159:09.66]I think it's me.
[159:32.14]This one's over here.
[159:32.76]I think we need a different cable for that one.
[159:38.84]Different cable?
[159:40.39]Yeah.
[159:40.85]That's looking like it's going to be up on the roof there, chump.
[159:43.09]Alright.
[159:45.87]It's time to criticize video games again.
[159:48.11]Who wants to do this?
[159:48.99]Who cares?
[159:49.39]Isn't this getting your brain juices going?
[159:55.19]No, not really.
[159:56.27]But who cares?
[159:57.99]Well, you're only saying that because I'm doing it for you.
[160:06.67]Ooh, this looks cool.
[160:07.46]101 damage, holy shit.
[160:22.54]You know what?
[160:23.04]I've brought this up before.
[160:24.04]I truly do not understand how you are an impatient gamer that hates all this dialog and stuff and you're like the least patient and yet you love House Flipper and you love cleaning game.
[160:35.53]And you love like viscera cleanup detail.
[160:38.89]Rebuttal time!
[160:40.88]So, if I opened up this game and the game was called Connect Cables to Each Other
[160:48.60]and I knew exactly what I was getting into.
[160:50.72]I'm going to connect cables to walls.
[160:53.36]That's the game.
[160:53.92]It's a puzzle game.
[160:54.78]It's a game where you connect cables.
[160:56.38]If I'm into that shit, I will play that cable game.
[160:59.08]Sounds awesome.
[160:59.82]House Flipper is a game where you know you're going to go in there and clean and paint.
[161:03.54]House Flipper is not a game that starts out when you have like a machete in your hand and it's like, oh, hey, welcome to House Flipper.
[161:09.02]Go slaughter people.
[161:10.94]If this game includes things from other games you do like, like if you loved fishing games and you find out, oh, wait, this game also has fishing.
[161:17.34]Mm hmm.
[161:20.12]You just hate that.
[161:21.38]No, no, because look, there's a difference between a game having fishing and a game having drag a cable across the room to pad 10 minutes onto the game.
[161:30.22]This is not a puzzle that people think is cool.
[161:33.02]It's just here.
[161:35.22]It's just here.
[161:37.51]It doesn't do anything.
[161:39.25]This is just here now.
[161:40.57]This is not a fishing minigame where I get achievements for getting the big mouth bass.
[161:45.61]Okay, so you want the big mouth.
[161:47.15]I'm just saying, like, if I go in a fishing game and I'm doing brrrr and I pull it up and it's like, this bass was 16 pounds.
[161:52.37]That, like, has weight behind it to me.
[161:55.33]We are just walking around this room looking to drag a cable to the other thing to plug it in.
[162:02.20]Okay.
[162:09.10]Okay, if there was, like, a mi- if there was mines, if there was, like, little mineral deposits everywhere, I would not- I would be happy about that.
[162:17.72]Oh, cool!
[162:18.06]Here's some ore!
[162:19.28]Why would you be happy about that?
[162:24.54]I wouldn't be happy about it, but it's not just like, hey, go walk around the building and drag a cable around.
[162:29.89]No, it's different.
[162:32.35]Okay, well, we gotta drag one more cable.
[162:39.19]There's one more thing, I think, here that needs a cable in it.
[162:42.73]And I think I'm gonna leave this one up to you.
[162:44.60]No, don't.
[162:45.26]I think it's right... Oh, no, there's, like, an inhibitor above us.
[162:54.94]Look, I'm sure that there's probably gonna be... There'll be a thing in our inventory that's, like, electrical boxes connected.
[163:02.89]Like, two out of fifty-eight.
[163:07.19]right I'm I'm let's see if it's there well you haven't connected any so it's probably not in your inventory I mean I've been I've been connecting them there's lock picks needed up here like there's a whole bunch of things you could be doing you know I'm looting stuff I'm picking up shoes
[163:36.20]I can't grab those?
[163:36.88]Why not?
[163:37.14]Are they too big?
[163:44.64]Oh, shit!
[163:51.16]Just do it.
[163:53.21]Do what?
[163:53.63]Just do the mission.
[163:56.17]I'm doing it, and for the record, I'm hating it.
[163:59.59]But at least I'm doing it.
[164:00.85]Okay.
[164:01.33]I just want to make sure we're very clear what you just said.
[164:05.60]I know what I just said, I'm just surprised that you, someone, I see, I don't like visceral cleanup detail.
[164:11.33]I think that House Flipper is fucking boring.
[164:13.50]I hated that.
[164:14.96]No, what?
[164:16.72]You hated visceral cleanup detail?
[164:20.61]Yes!
[164:21.63]That was the whole premise of why you wanted to play with me.
[164:25.42]Because you knew I would hate it.
[164:27.22]But like that, it's like, it scratches like a dopamine itch to like clean up stuff and move stuff and make things look nice.
[164:35.16]Yeah, I bet your like kitchen's real clean, right?
[164:37.86]Actually, it is.
[164:39.28]It's actually very clean.
[164:41.51]I contribute a lot of cleaning.
[164:43.01]A lot.
[164:44.09]Okay?
[164:44.47]Yes.
[164:49.01]I'm not buying it.
[164:50.42]What do you mean you don't buy it?
[164:51.62]You don't buy it that I like clean my own places?
[164:54.10]The tone that you just took.
[164:56.34]For a second, I thought you were talking about the tub.
[164:58.04]The tub?
[164:58.87]Do you do the tub too?
[165:02.27]Look, okay, we got to get this to go somewhere.
[165:05.13]And I opened this door and I don't know where this goes.
[165:08.31]I don't know where any of the things are.
[165:09.63]There's no like objective markers from where they're supposed to be.
[165:14.36]There's like a substation basement down here.
[165:17.22]Oh, there it is.
[165:21.52]Where's this one going?
[165:23.32]Up here to the two, right?
[165:24.58]Oh, no, this one's gotta go to the three.
[165:26.64]Oh, right.
[165:27.18]That's the number three.
[165:33.55]Gotta come over here.
[165:34.09]Now I'm taking it through the vent.
[165:38.09]Shit!
[165:38.59]Watch out!
[165:38.91]Zombies!
[165:40.51]Dad, dodge!
[165:41.67]Dodge!
[165:41.93]Watch out!
[165:43.63]Grenade out!
[165:43.99]Grenade!
[165:44.25]Grenade!
[165:48.15]Watch out!
[165:48.47]Whoa!
[165:48.73]Parkour!
[165:49.13]Got it!
[165:58.15]What is the point of this?
[166:04.73]Jerma, I need help.
[166:06.45]Okay.
[166:06.83]So, from there, you need to walk.
[166:08.75]If that's three, I don't think this is correct.
[166:12.21]Because this is yellow.
[166:13.11]You have something plugged into three.
[166:14.75]That one is not correct.
[166:16.54]Let me get that off.
[166:19.98]And I need you to... This has to go to two.
[166:22.04]Two is over here.
[166:23.20]Two goes to two.
[166:23.76]Stop.
[166:30.50]I think I gotta climb up here.
[166:31.64]And then... One is wrong too, I think.
[166:40.32]Really?
[166:41.80]Where is three?
[166:42.46]Can you go stand by three so I at least know where the fuck I'm going?
[166:44.95]Wait, one is connected to one.
[166:46.51]I think that's right.
[166:50.35]I'm gonna scream.
[166:50.89]Does one have to connect to two and then two to three?
[166:52.77]Don't scream.
[166:54.07]It won't even pick up and it won't be funny.
[166:55.21]You're gonna hurt your voice.
[167:00.47]How do I release?
[167:02.35]Yes, I'm... You plugged three into three?
[167:05.63]Yeah.
[167:07.03]Now we got one more to go.
[167:08.37]Okay, so I have this one here.
[167:10.63]So where does this one go now?
[167:11.62]This one goes to two.
[167:14.58]And two is up there?
[167:16.12]How do I let this go?
[167:19.78]Hold F. Okay, so if you grab two and put it into two, does that do it?
[167:27.68]I mean, I got to go put it into two because you're not doing it.
[167:30.93]Yeah, well, I had to let it go because it was all tangled up.
[167:34.25]I don't know where two is.
[167:35.03]I forget where two is.
[167:37.97]I think it's down there in that corner.
[167:39.99]Two.
[167:40.33]Wait, does it show up on the map?
[167:52.22]What?
[167:54.02]You holding onto it and using it to swing.
[167:57.52]Yeah.
[167:59.40]I'll go find two.
[168:00.07]Hold on.
[168:03.97]Do you remember if it was up or down?
[168:07.03]I think it's over there in that corner.
[168:08.21]I'm stuck.
[168:11.45]The game just crashed.
[168:13.11]Did it?
[168:13.75]Yeah.
[168:20.56]That was a fun dying light session.
[168:21.98]Are you done?
[168:28.52]You know, I'm just saying I don't think your game crashed.
[168:30.70]I swear to God it did.
