[00:02.92]Alright.
[00:04.11]I've expelled the urine from my body.
[00:09.69]Let's see.
[00:10.67]What can we do for a little bit?
[00:13.91]There's another one here, but I have another game.
[00:18.68]Let me just see.
[00:22.04]Hmm.
[00:25.00]Now on Steam.
[00:29.96]Going back to Neighbors from Hell.
[00:32.65]No, we are not doing that.
[00:35.67]You know, maybe we'll just, um... Maybe we'll just IRL it for, like, 30 or 40 minutes.
[00:42.61]Read some bits, hang out, and just chill.
[00:43.99]Because I don't really have any other games installed for tonight.
[00:48.80]I thought that was going to take us, like, at least another three or four hours, but... No, I hit the wall, and I had to just stop, and I lost.
[00:55.18]Got the bad end.
[00:55.70]Got one of the endings.
[00:58.14]Kingdom Hearts.
[00:58.80]I'm not going to play Kingdom Hearts.
[01:07.71]Watch the re- No, I didn't- I don't deserve to watch the real ending.
[01:17.63]Wait, you want to get over it?
[01:18.99]I'm not going to get- I'm not even going to close to get over it.
[01:24.41]Um... I just don't really have anything else prepared.
[01:28.99]Man, what if we play Emilia Earhart?
[01:33.03]Alright, this is what we're going to play.
[01:35.06]I don't care.
[01:36.77]I don't even know what this is.
[01:40.19]Why do I have this?
[01:45.67]I don't know.
[01:46.05]I really don't know what this is and I don't know why I have it, but we're going to play it.
[01:48.57]Let's open it.
[01:52.23]Can I even capture this?
[01:57.24]Comic mischief and tobacco references.
[02:00.80]So be aware of that, guys.
[02:06.05]There's no audio.
[02:07.47]So, hold on.
[02:12.02]I can't play the movies because the movies is not installed on this computer.
[02:19.74]I think this is just a shitty hidden object game.
[02:31.62]Okay.
[02:34.28]Can I even capture it?
[02:37.96]Let's try.
[02:48.10]Game capture.
[02:53.05]Amelia.
[02:57.87]Can you see it?
[03:00.84]I don't think... This is not... Oh boy, this is not going to be cool.
[03:05.98]This is going to be really bad, and this is going to be a waste of time.
[03:08.97]I might even just kill this before it starts.
[03:14.97]Yeah, I think I was going to kill this before it starts.
[03:20.62]Hold on.
[03:21.00]What do you guys think?
[03:27.60]Strawpull, should I kill it?
[03:29.72]You're about to see it in 10 seconds.
[03:42.49]Why do I have this?
[03:43.87]Kill it!
[03:47.83]Kill it!
[03:48.45]Kill it!
[03:49.36]Firescape!
[04:01.38]No, this is Amelia Earhart.
[04:03.97]The search for Amelia... No, I don't care.
[04:05.81]We're playing this.
[04:07.77]Options.
[04:09.07]Effects.
[04:09.77]I'm gonna turn it down a little bit.
[04:12.15]No, turn it up.
[04:13.91]I can handle that.
[04:18.86]Trial by... Oh, everybody's so pissed.
[04:22.10]Alright, let's speedrun.
[04:23.38]Here we go.
[04:24.24]Chicago, 1937.
[04:28.24]They don't even have voice acting.
[04:30.46]That's how you can tell the game's a real absolute mess.
[04:33.16]This place is a mess too.
[04:36.27]Alright.
[04:38.91]For the great aid of the city, I don't know where this came from.
[04:45.00]It's a great motion tween there.
[04:46.54]Alright, just skip this whole thing.
[04:49.50]Whoa!
[04:57.88]Okay.
[05:00.06]He's gone!
[05:00.96]And he's gone.
[05:02.14]Alright.
[05:05.70]Time to clean up.
[05:08.77]Find all the objects in the list at the bottom of the screen by clicking on them to clear a room.
[05:12.77]You can only find objects currently listed.
[05:16.29]Be careful.
[05:16.75]Random clicks will decrease your time.
[05:24.26]Nice pick.
[05:28.26]Nice, got it.
[05:30.42]Made this joke three years ago.
[05:45.73]Delete the game?
[05:48.07]Delete the game?
[05:48.97]Do you want me to delete the game?
[05:51.48]I hope I get a screamer.
[05:57.67]Alright, it's gone.
[05:58.61]Fine, fine.
[05:59.71]It's gone.
[06:02.61]Quit the game.
[06:04.77]Delete the game.
[06:13.48]How much is that game?
[06:14.56]Let's look it up.
[06:18.76]Show my... Show yourself uninstalling it.
[06:21.95]Well, that doesn't mean anything.
[06:22.91]It's on Steam.
[06:23.21]Steam.
[06:24.98]It's just going to be... You know what you guys are going to get out of that?
[06:26.93]You're going to get to see gray text.
[06:30.69]That's it.
[06:31.33]That's all you're going to get out of it.
[06:32.21]Let me see.
[06:41.42]Do I even have... What's it going to look like if I turn this on?
[06:49.86]Let's find out.
[06:55.96]Can you even see me?
[07:00.63]No.
[07:00.89]Why can you not see me?
[07:02.19]This is like freaking me out.
[07:03.07]It says I'm being recorded right now, but you can't see me.
[07:08.88]That's fucking terrifying.
[07:12.36]What is it?
[07:12.96]Oh, that's why.
[07:15.74]What is being picked up right now then?
[07:24.78]I'm going to be a deer in headlights in about 10 seconds.
[07:32.78]Oh, that's why.
[07:33.28]Okay.
[07:36.78]Alright, here we go.
[07:37.34]Here I come.
[07:38.22]We're going to sit here and just hang out.
[07:40.26]I got nothing.
[07:42.05]Not enough for today.
[07:43.01]Is it going to work?
[07:49.57]Work.
[07:50.89]Let's go.
[07:55.05]What are you doing?
[08:21.06]Like closer and closer.
[08:22.54]Whoa.
[08:29.21]Here comes the psycho.
[08:30.35]Hi, guys.
[08:38.40]So, what we're going to do... Nude.
[08:42.06]I'm not nude.
[08:45.62]I mean, I might be bald, but I need a haircut bad.
[08:49.78]This is what I look like when I don't have a... When I don't take a shower, this is what I look like.
[08:57.01]My hair's all fucking greasy and gross and sloppy.
[08:59.29]I got hair all over me.
[09:01.27]But... What we're gonna do... Dude, I've needed a haircut since like six months ago.
[09:10.79]And I just don't even care.
[09:12.58]I've lost all the will to care.
[09:13.72]I was thinking about taking a pair of pliers and just like... Not a pair of pliers.
[09:18.20]Not pliers.
[09:21.06]Nice Star Wars.
[09:22.22]Yeah, this is from the Empire Attacks the Sith.
[09:25.70]This is episode one.
[09:28.25]Alright, let's do some bits.
[09:32.21]And let's also, I mean, about three hours now.
[09:35.79]I just don't want to stop streaming before three hours.
[09:38.47]Really didn't think that that was going to take us to like less than three hours.
[09:44.40]That game is what I was going to say.
[09:48.94]So let me change the lighting here.
[09:52.04]Lighting sucks in here.
[09:58.27]There we go.
[10:00.35]Hello?
[10:01.72]Can you do it, please?
[10:05.06]So Tuesday is gonna be the meme funeral.
[10:08.90]I'm setting, I'm gonna, it's gonna be, we're gonna say a lot of great things about these memes.
[10:13.12]Because they have, they've been around for a long time.
[10:16.36]That's better.
[10:17.22]That's much better.
[10:18.22]I look, I look, this is cool looking.
[10:19.70]I look like I actually know what I'm doing.
[10:21.82]Doesn't this look like this is just my setup?
[10:24.18]This is like what I do on my stream.
[10:25.76]I do like cool blue shit.
[10:30.08]Yeah, the Mean Funeral is going to be on Tuesday.
[10:36.63]Why am I killing my only good jokes?
[10:38.11]They're going to make so many more fucking... You don't think there's going to be more jokes in 2018?
[10:41.93]You understand how many more jokes are going to happen in 2018?
[10:43.85]Some of the streams and videos that you're going to watch this year...
[10:49.72]are going to trump everything that I've ever done in my whole life.
[10:52.99]So, just don't worry.
[10:54.45]There's going to be plenty more dumb shit to laugh about that you can, like, make fun of me with.
[10:59.45]I mean, because right now, you're not allowed to say... So, I can't even say it.
[11:05.01]It's been burned into my brain now.
[11:06.05]I downloaded the chip.
[11:07.41]So, like, versus saying, like, or... It's just not possible.
[11:11.51]I'm going to try to say it, like, five times.
[11:14.09]You can't do it.
[11:14.81]So...
[11:16.65]Like you guys can move on to something else to talk shit about with, right?
[11:22.98]Ban me if you have to.
[11:27.66]No one's going to get like actually banned.
[11:30.04]That's a joke.
[11:31.58]You're just going to get timed out for fucking five minutes.
[11:35.06]Maybe like 20.
[11:37.17]Or all day.
[11:37.81]It could be all day.
[11:39.57]Anyways.

[13:52.95]And hi, Jerma.
[13:54.29]My name is... Thanks for the $5 and correcting my pronunciation of your name.

[14:22.74]Uh, I will try not to mess your name up ever again.
[14:24.37]Hey, Sprite!
[14:25.07]37, thanks for the bits.
[14:26.29]It's been a year since I started watching you around Christmas 2016 when I was severely sick with pneumonia.
[14:33.43]Damn.
[14:34.72]Thank you for the laughs.
[14:35.56]I know this isn't much right now, but I hope to fix that in the future.
[14:38.74]Hope you've had a good year so far.
[14:40.42]Cheers, dude.
[14:41.80]Thank you, Sprite.
[14:43.22]Uh, glad that you got over pneumonia.
[14:46.12]That's terrible.
[14:46.73]Pneumonia really can, like, fuck you up bad.
[14:49.01]So, glad you're
[14:51.92]Not sick with pneumonia anymore.
[14:54.00]I mean, it would be like a year at this point.
[14:57.02]So is that even possible?
[14:59.42]Thank God you're still around.
[15:00.90]Because that's a terrible fucking illness that is hard to treat sometimes.
[15:08.01]But thank you, dude.
[15:10.15]I hope to see you sticking around.
[15:12.45]We have lots of dumb shit planned for 2018.
[15:18.33]Boston is better than New York.
[15:24.35]I mean, I'm a little biased.
[15:25.37]I mean, I think Star Wars is better than New York.
[15:29.62]Is it, though?
[15:30.62]I don't know.
[15:32.72]Is Star Wars actually better than New York?
[15:38.30]Yeah.
[15:40.28]Yeah, I think so.
[15:43.70]You're bad and dumb and... All I can read is bad and dumb, dude.
[15:48.52]I'm sorry.
[15:48.87]Let me try it again.
[15:50.75]You're bad and dumb and... I can't.
[15:55.19]Uh, streamer is a dirty cop.
[15:56.57]Thanks, Bang, for the bits there.
[15:58.35]Morning, Maple.
[15:58.93]Thanks for the $1.
[15:59.49]LA really stands for Lawnmower Avenue.
[16:02.52]I'm so glad you're playing this again tonight.
[16:04.06]Last night I had me laughing so hard I nearly choked on my dinner.
[16:06.70]That game was great.
[16:07.64]Don't get me wrong.
[16:08.28]That game was fucking awesome.
[16:09.80]Don't listen to my nonsense in the end there.
[16:11.76]It's supposed to be hard.
[16:14.54]But, yeah.
[16:15.69]That's a classic PlayStation 2 game.
[16:20.07]Sometimes I just can't handle reality and I go off the handle.
[16:23.11]I'm sorry.
[16:23.47]That just happens.
[16:25.76]Is anything planned for the main channel this year?
[16:27.90]I talked about this before.
[16:28.63]I'll briefly just very... If you watch the VOD from... Just Tuesday's VOD?
[16:35.37]What about two streams ago?
[16:37.20]I don't know if I even streamed on Tuesday or not because of the internet problems, but... 2018 is going to be like a combination of... Sort of like...
[16:46.02]The word, I don't want to use like weird buzzwords here, but Twitch and YouTube are going to kind of live in the same ecosystem together here.
[16:54.01]You're going to see on this channel on Twitch, a lot of live, actually like heavily produced skits that will be live on this channel.
[17:03.77]So I want to kind of combine the two platforms and make it so they can live together pretty much in harmony.
[17:11.22]So you'll see what I'm talking about in the next few months.
[17:14.65]Because some of the things you'll see on the stream will be almost like broadcasted live videos.
[17:21.28]If that makes any sense.
[17:22.96]And the first couple of those are slated for... I don't want to give you exact dates, but we're talking about maybe somewhere into March.
[17:33.69]March or April is when you're going to start to see these things.
[17:36.63]And much earlier than that, actually.
[17:38.25]One of them in particular is going to happen very soon.
[17:40.65]Okay.
[17:42.90]Hopefully it's worth it, but I'm going to try my best to make sure it is.
[17:48.13]Not so much video game focus this year.
[17:51.31]We're going to try to do some experimental, almost TV show-esque type shit, if that makes any sense.
[17:59.96]We'll try it.
[18:01.42]I have to keep myself interested.
[18:03.00]Otherwise, I can't do it anymore.
[18:04.80]If that makes, you know, my points coming across there.
[18:08.46]If I don't stay interested, I can't care about it.
[18:12.16]And I want to care about it.
[18:13.04]And I want to continue to care about it.
[18:14.74]So I'm going to continue to try to do things that interest me to try to make the best content that I possibly can.
[18:22.17]That's pretty much it.
[18:24.71]Is it going to be live or pre-recorded but aired live?
[18:28.79]Live.
[18:30.00]Live, but potential for... Maybe you watch a video that gets put here first.
[18:39.57]Maybe I broadcast a video.
[18:41.17]We're talking both scenarios here.
[18:44.55]Live content that could be a video, but it's broadcasted live.
[18:48.05]And then videos that are broadcasted here first.
[18:51.60]And then just go to the main channel first.
[18:55.02]with complete total high definition fidelity, high bit rate.
[18:58.72]So it just would be essentially broadcasted here first.
[19:02.34]As a, cause it's fun to, I imagine like in a scenario where I got to sit here and like watch you guys watch the videos and see how you guys are reacting to things in real time.
[19:14.82]See what you guys are saying in real time
[19:17.03]That would be cool.
[19:19.14]It would be interesting to see.
[19:21.24]I feel like that's a new media.
[19:22.86]You know what I mean?
[19:24.74]That's like a new form of entertainment.
[19:26.12]Just being able to sit here and hang out and watch a video and talk.
[19:30.72]But I don't say anything.
[19:31.74]Maybe I could be in the chat or something during some of these.
[19:35.75]But I feel like that would be a lot of fun.
[19:37.65]And it's something that I want to focus on completely in 2018.
[19:42.76]Live broadcasted, pre-recorded, live pre-planned broadcast live content.
[19:47.62]Got it.
[19:48.02]You got it.
[19:48.50]Good.
[19:52.20]You just spam new memes in real time, man.
[19:54.81]It's in real time.
[19:58.33]Trevor just watches you guys instead.
[19:59.79]But I want to see what you guys have to say.
[20:03.23]That's more fun for me.
[20:03.97]Because like comments, right?
[20:04.85]YouTube comments are great.
[20:08.06]I mean, well, hold on a second.
[20:10.14]Let me back that up.
[20:11.93]If you watch a video on a YouTube channel and then I kind of get to like scroll through and see like what you said like after the fact.
[20:21.22]Maybe you have like a few minutes to process the video.
[20:23.52]Maybe you pause the video and you come down and you write something and then you come back and you watch the rest of it.
[20:29.74]It's great.
[20:30.82]But what about like the whole great like real time live watching with somebody content where you can actually talk in real time?
[20:41.70]just find that interesting so I'm going to try and I guess that's where I'll put that but don't take this like I said last time we talked about this I want to be very clear it's like video games are not going away I just want to take the focus away from them so I'll still play games and my schedule is going to stay pretty much the same I mean there's a lot of we'll be doing a lot of shooting and stuff and a lot of setting up live scenarios and live broadcasts but
[21:08.78]The focus of this channel for this year is going to be that stuff.
[21:13.94]And of course, like I told you guys before, there's plenty of games that are coming out this year that I can't fucking wait to play.
[21:21.06]There's plenty of other games that I also want to play too that are equally as interesting to me that I would put a lot of time into.
[21:29.26]I'm going to reinvent the streaming on stream.
[21:34.31]I mean, it's not like I'm reinventing the wheel.
[21:38.24]I'm just kind of deciding to get in the car.
[21:42.14]I'm deciding to get in the car and go down a different highway.
[21:45.49]You know, like 110 North.
[21:46.09]You know what I'm saying?
[21:48.13]Going down 110 North, make sure I get there on time.
[21:51.77]Do a telethon donation.
[21:54.71]There's a lot of interesting things that could happen here.
[22:01.04]And it is a clown car.
[22:02.26]Of course it is.
[22:03.94]Why would it be anything else?
[22:06.79]But long-winded response there, very like absolute long-winded, just pressing the bellows and telling you guys like a 12-minute story there.
[22:18.11]But expect that in the next few months.
[22:20.07]And going forward from there, we have a plan where every probably 30 days or so, there'll be another one of those streams.
[22:28.34]Or there'll be another one of those videos that kind of live in the same anthill as the YouTube channel's
[22:36.98]And the Twitch channel.
[22:40.22]And I'm going to play the fuck out of Monster Hunter.
[22:42.02]So, don't worry.
[22:43.50]Video games aren't going anywhere.
[22:46.34]But, I mean, I'm not going to... I can't lie, right?
[22:48.06]Like, let's go here, too.
[22:52.46]There hasn't been that very many... Like, games that are coming out now.
[22:57.81]They aren't, like, grabbing me like they used to do.
[22:59.97]You know what I'm saying?
[23:00.59]Like, I haven't sat down and played any new games that really...
[23:04.27]make me want to sit there and play them for more than like 10 to 15 hours and maybe that's me getting older it could be but I think it's just a natural progression to I can't even like think of a game that I would highly recommend in 2017.
[23:27.52]Like, do you know about games of the year?
[23:28.68]I don't even know if I have, like, I mean, like, was Hollow Knight even 2017?
[23:33.61]Like, Resident Evil 7, maybe?
[23:38.29]Cuphead?
[23:38.75]Like, what else even came out in 2017?
[23:40.09]I don't know.
[23:46.35]But those are great.
[23:48.82]But I think my point is that it used to be like two or three years ago, I would be playing everything and I'd be all over the place.
[23:54.69]Oh, I've got to play this.
[23:55.33]I'm going to play this.
[23:55.81]I'm going to play the shit out of this.
[23:56.73]I can play this all night.
[23:58.00]Oh, what is the time?
[23:58.74]It's like four in the morning and I'm still here.
[24:00.58]I don't do that anymore.
[24:03.96]And I think it would be a disservice to you guys that are watching to tell you
[24:09.43]That I do that, but I don't.
[24:12.04]So I think this natural progression to keep going down this path of I want to make video content and I want to make it potentially live too, hopefully works out for the entire Jerma community.
[24:29.99]I'm going to put like 400 quotes on that because, I don't know, it's a...
[24:36.21]There are a lot of people.
[24:38.33]There's a lot of people that are in this space here that, I don't know, a lot of people have a lot of opinions.
[24:46.13]Some people might also not be happy about the fact that I'm saying this right now.
[24:50.65]That I'm not going to be playing super into video games anymore and I'm moving on to making videos and live broadcasted content.
[24:59.31]But it's not going to be any different.
[25:00.11]It's going to be the same shit that I've been doing for years.
[25:03.15]It's just going to be a little bit more done.
[25:07.44]I don't have any opinions.
[25:08.86]Yeah, you do.
[25:09.16]Everybody does.
[25:12.22]What do you mean a Jerma community?
[25:13.48]You mean in quotes?
[25:14.00]Are we not a real community?
[25:16.08]No, but like that word, that's like a buzzword.
[25:18.94]You know what I mean?
[25:20.24]Everybody says, oh, you know, my community.
[25:22.66]My community.
[25:24.10]I've got a community.
[25:26.22]My community.
[25:27.52]It's like, I don't know.
[25:30.95]I don't want to treat you guys like you're some kind of
[25:36.63]narcissistic ego boost for me.
[25:39.36]Oh, you know what?
[25:40.04]My community thinks that.
[25:41.70]They're my community.
[25:43.58]They're not yours, motherfucker.
[25:45.44]They're my community.
[25:46.56]I just don't want it to be... I mean, it is a useful word, but I just don't want to treat you guys like you're some kind of... Like I'm fucking God and you guys are like the children down here.
[25:56.49]You're mine.
[25:56.93]All of you.
[26:03.60]Why do I look like George Washington?
[26:07.44]Because he's a founding father and I want to honor his life and legacy.
[26:15.71]George Washington.
[26:17.67]Hold on.
[26:19.01]This is important.
[26:23.75]I need a picture of George Washington looking this way.
[26:27.49]Let's get it.
[26:32.22]This is going to make me laugh out loud.
[26:37.38]It's not quite.
[26:38.08]It's not quite.
[26:40.16]It's not George Washington.
[26:41.76]I mean, it's pretty close.
[26:42.86]But no, it's only one side is George Washington.
[26:46.02]Hold on.
[26:47.10]We'll see.
[26:49.84]George Washington looks like my grandmother.
[26:53.96]He really does.
[26:54.58]George Washington looks like my grandmother.
[26:57.90]So it makes sense, doesn't it?
[27:02.49]Wooden ass, wooden teeth.
[27:03.95]Alright, let's put it up here.
[27:13.64]Where is it?
[27:13.98]There it is.
[27:15.40]Okay.
[27:22.16]It's not even close.
[27:23.83]I mean, it could be.
[27:27.19]Here, I'll help you.
[27:29.53]Let's do this right.
[28:01.47]Fuck, it is George Washington.
[28:03.78]God damn it.
[28:04.93]We gotta try the other side.
[28:34.69]God damn it, I do fucking look like George Washington.
[28:41.66]This sucks.
[28:42.30]Let's do the whole thing.
[28:50.84]What about the mouth?
[29:05.37]This just looks like I have one of those shitty Halloween masks on.
[29:17.70]Why does it have frog eyes?
[29:24.13]Alright, we're gonna move on from this?
[29:26.57]Colors don't match.
[29:27.53]You have to match the colors now.
[29:29.11]Don't make me do this.
[29:30.03]Now I have to.
[29:31.60]No, I have to.
[29:32.37]I have to do that now.
[29:33.51]Oh, fuck me.
[29:34.43]Whatever.
[29:35.63]We're out of content anyways tonight.
[29:38.05]Here we go.
[29:44.16]This has got to be... What color is this?
[29:49.76]Get it back on there.
[29:51.80]So we've got to be like a bright green.
[29:57.17]What else do we need?
[30:00.44]So it's very like blown out and it looks almost like yellow and green.
[30:05.75]You gotta take away the cool blue.
[30:12.19]I'm like, I gotta, I'm not, I'm like a little, I'm like a little too red.
[30:14.49]We need to blow this up a little bit more.
[30:23.35]Let's change this.
[30:34.11]Less contrast.
[30:35.75]Bring up the brightness a ton.
[30:51.03]I can't believe I'm spending this much time on this.
[30:59.37]No, it's not right.
[31:01.03]It's not correct.
[31:30.88]Hold on, I'll get it.
[32:11.93]Shit!
[32:31.08]Right there.
[32:33.82]Alright, can I do, can I move, can I do this with another president?
[32:39.20]Hold on.
[32:39.46]I gotta look the right way.
[32:40.44]Let me just look the right way first so you can like screen cap it.
[32:43.04]I need to make it bigger too.
[32:43.94]I gotta select them both.
[32:49.19]Get them both selected.
[32:56.47]I gotta look the right way.
[32:58.45]Like here.
[33:00.49]Alright.
[33:08.99]Okay, I found the thing we're doing.
[33:10.97]Get Donald Trump.
[33:13.07]Fine, I'll try it with Trump.
[33:17.95]Might as well, right?
[33:23.60]That was pretty good.
[33:24.34]Alright, let's get to Donald Trump's face.
[33:29.14]This is a perfect one.
[33:31.37]This is like a perfect straight shot face.
[33:37.68]Let's bring it in.
[33:45.98]Okay.
[33:46.34]Shit, I gotta horizontal flip this.
[33:51.42]Alright, let's come back.
[34:00.87]I gotta change the color on this one, too.
[34:10.85]This one ain't even funny because it's just... Yeah, this one sucks.
[34:28.82]It's got to be something way worse.
[34:31.48]What if we do this?
[34:37.05]Let's do Donald Trump's face.
[34:39.51]George Washington's face.
[34:40.63]And, like, my hairline.
[34:42.41]No, we'll do, like, my mouth.
[35:05.53]I swear that my tax bill is gonna be the best one.
[35:11.66]Who's talking?
[35:12.28]Is that George Washington?
[35:14.68]Or is that Donald John Trump?
[35:22.80]What else we got?
[35:23.32]How about, like, political joke?
[35:27.85]There's no political joke.
[35:31.71]I gotta do one more.
[35:32.87]One more that just doesn't work at all.
[35:33.93]How about, um,
[35:48.68]You guys are gonna fucking love this one.
[35:51.50]Oh, you guys are gonna love this one.
[35:53.57]Absolutely.
[36:03.31]I gotta get this one right.
[36:12.74]Hold on, I gotta get it right.
[36:14.88]This one has to be importantly correct, you know what I'm saying?
[36:22.81]Somebody just said, I hate this.
[36:25.75]Last one, I promise.
[36:29.39]It's going to be blue.
[36:31.95]Back to blue.
[36:32.85]Configure.
[36:33.39]Let's get it configured again.
[36:39.75]Turn down that brightness.
[36:47.16]Okay, let's come back here.
[36:53.15]There we go.
[36:59.59]It's just a picture of your face.
[37:09.76]I gotta move this over here.
[37:10.94]That makes it easier.
[37:25.50]Alright, ready?
[37:49.66]Let's go up here.
[38:03.70]This just doesn't work like this.
[38:05.02]It needs to be much brighter.
[38:20.08]That's pretty close.
[38:28.37]Almost.
[38:29.43]Ready for your screenshot.
[38:47.78]That, like, angers me that I look that much like this fucking guy.
[38:54.72]It's the Green Goblin.
[38:57.46]Why is this happening?
[38:58.96]I don't know.
[38:59.46]I don't know how we got here.
[39:00.41]We did somehow.
[39:02.85]Let me reset this.
[39:06.69]Somebody said something in a bit and I don't even know what the hell it was.
[39:10.35]And...
[39:11.93]It was something.
[39:12.61]Somebody said something.
[39:13.49]I don't know why this triggered this.
[39:14.93]It just did.
[39:16.25]Sometimes this shit just happens.
[39:18.09]Let's go back to the blue.
[39:23.36]Some guy.
[39:23.92]Nah, that's better.
[39:27.30]No, it's not.
[39:27.90]I want to do this one.
[39:30.00]No, let's do this one.
[39:32.24]Oh, fuck yeah.
[39:35.77]Fuck yeah.
[39:37.43]I got like green teeth in this one.
[39:40.96]Alright, let's finish up the bits here.
[39:44.85]And... Everything's blue.
[39:49.11]That's insulting, Willem Dafoe.
[39:51.11]Come on!
[39:51.57]No, it's not.
[39:53.47]I feel like I'm watching a real stream.
[39:57.36]Exactly.
[39:57.82]There's blue lights and shit all over the place.
[39:59.92]All I need... God damn it!
[40:02.40]I just need a light over here.
[40:04.78]I need like a light back here that slowly turns around and changes all kinds of colors of the rainbow.
[40:10.96]Fuck.
[40:11.97]I'm not allowed to be a streamer unless I have one of those.
[40:14.07]It's too bad.
[40:18.21]Anyways, it got even darker somehow.
[40:22.56]Where did I end up here?
[40:24.20]Clink, thank you for the $1.
[40:25.50]Is this that new non-video game stream content that you were talking about?
[40:30.24]No, this is called I ran out of material tonight because we beat the game too quickly.
[40:35.49]So I'm just sitting here for like 30, 40 minutes, just hanging out, being a fucking real, real funny guy, right?
[40:40.05]Being a real funny guy, putting pictures of my face.
[40:41.83]Remember when I did George Washington and Donald Trump topical, topical, political, topical humor, political, topical, top, topolitical.
[40:48.38]I was doing some topolitical humor there.
[40:51.02]And yeah, got some green teeth too.
[40:54.70]Remember when I made that joke?
[40:57.46]Beat the game.
[40:57.94]I did beat the game.
[40:58.48]I got to the, excuse me.
[41:00.50]I got to the end of the game.
[41:02.79]I finished the game.
[41:04.15]I finished True Crime Streets of LA.
[41:06.75]It doesn't mean I have to beat the game.
[41:07.93]I finished it.
[41:09.17]I got an end.
[41:09.95]I got to the end of the game.
[41:13.05]The topographical.
[41:14.82]Alright.
[41:15.22]Thank you, though, Clink.
[41:16.66]Blaze9669, thanks for the $1.
[41:18.54]I'm Blue Abadie Abadie.
[41:21.24]Yes, we are.
[41:22.48]How do you say your name?
[41:26.36]IltemNC.
[41:29.66]Iltem.
[41:30.68]Thank you, IltemNC for the...
[41:32.98]$15.
[41:33.14]They just say, why?
[41:34.42]I don't know.
[41:36.60]Like I said, just sitting here.
[41:39.50]Sorry, I'm a fucking dickhead.
[41:41.84]But thank you for the $15, dude.
[41:42.92]Much appreciated.
[41:44.60]Sneezeburger, thank you for the bits.
[41:46.00]So, have you lost your mind yet, or is it still a work in progress?
[41:48.40]It's been a work in progress since I was like 14.
[41:50.58]So, who knows when it's going to finally be gone.
[41:54.82]But here's the good thing about losing your mind.
[41:57.26]When you lose your mind over time...
[42:00.06]When you get to be old and senile and you're actually crazy, people just write you off because they don't care.
[42:05.09]Because you've been like that for a long time anyway, so you can just be a crazy old person.
[42:08.47]Who cares?
[42:09.49]Everyone will know that that's just the way you are.
[42:13.09]The blue... Alright, we'll do it.
[42:17.81]Fine.
[42:18.37]You got me.
[42:20.67]You do got me.
[42:21.49]That means I have to do it.
[42:29.86]The green is not even that intense.
[42:32.46]I'm just not feeling it.
[42:35.33]It's not green enough.
[42:37.61]The blue is crazy.
[42:39.59]It's not an intense, crazy green.
[42:44.34]I would love to.
[42:47.82]That's as green as we're going to get with this program.
[42:54.76]No, we'll go back to the blue.
[42:55.74]This is nice and fucked up.
[42:57.12]I like it.
[42:57.50]Let's lighten it up, though.
[42:59.60]Like that.
[43:01.66]Can I do that with green?
[43:03.24]No.
[43:03.50]We'll stay here.
[43:05.63]I like this.
[43:06.21]You can't really even see me, so it makes me feel more confident when I talk.
[43:11.17]Red is a radish.
[43:12.01]Fine.
[43:14.05]We'll at least go pink.
[43:17.07]No, that's ugly.
[43:18.59]Blue.
[43:20.47]Thank you, though, Sneezeburg.
[43:23.06]Thank you to SticksRenegade for the $1.
[43:24.42]Make George Harrington the color money green and make it the new emote.
[43:29.91]Oh, God, that's fucking funny.
[43:32.49]Don't know who that is, though.
[43:36.67]But, yeah.
[43:38.59]Make that green and maybe, you know, we'll call that like Jerma Cash.
[43:42.89]That might be fun.
[43:45.17]That might be fun.
[43:47.25]You guys want like a Jerma Cash emote and it's just that fucked up ugly face, but it's got like a dollar bill kind of.
[43:53.67]I might just do that.
[43:56.11]That sounds good.
[43:57.03]Hi, Lord Nameless.
[43:57.83]Thanks for the $1 big wow.
[44:00.09]Orkin Bread, thanks.
[44:01.09]Orkin Beard.
[44:02.38]Orkin Redbeard, thanks for the $1.
[44:03.62]I don't want to be that weeb, but I want to ask if you're going to play Doki Doki No.
[44:12.44]No.
[44:15.22]No.

[44:49.87]Look, I'm not the bad guy here.
[44:51.49]I'm not the bad guy.
[44:53.11]This is not my policy.
[44:54.73]It's just, you know, it's not my policy.
[44:57.25]It's the policy of the channel.
[45:02.22]Not my policy.
[45:05.14]Boss!
[45:07.06]Argh!
[45:07.20]Argh, the boss!
[45:09.08]I hate the boss!
[45:10.22]He's such a dick!
[45:13.43]Thank you, though.
[45:13.93]Appreciate it.
[45:15.23]Ken Dalio, thanks for the $5.
[45:16.57]Hey, Jeremiah, my mom has been in the hospital for a while now, and things are not looking too good.
[45:25.86]Her final request is that you release all 342 pages of your book.

[46:10.57]Techno Toast, thanks for the 50 cents.
[46:13.47]When am I going to launch the Patreon for your video stuff?
[46:15.55]I really want to support you there too.
[46:22.08]Hold that thought.
[46:23.40]Because there's a... Hold that thought.
[46:28.90]Hold that thought.
[46:30.98]Take it out of here.
[46:31.97]Like, you know Harry Potter when he takes the wand and he, like, he takes, like, the demons out of his head and shit and they put it in that fountain and then people do, like, the fountain drugs and they can see other people's memories.
[46:42.49]Just hold that.
[46:43.19]Just pull it out and put it in a fucking fountain and take a look at it in, like, a few weeks.
[46:47.84]In, like, a month.
[46:48.28]In, like, two months.
[46:50.00]In, like, a month and a half, maybe.
[46:52.44]Maybe, like, two months.
[46:54.94]Uh, but yeah.
[46:55.60]Thank you.
[46:56.75]Also, thank you to Cleveland Lover for the three bucks.

[47:08.77]I'm not going to take the... I'm not going to take my camera into the shower.
[47:16.81]It's not going to happen.
[47:18.47]So... Sorry about that.
[47:22.84]You're going to have to... That's not this kind of stream.
[47:25.66]That's a different kind of stream.

[47:43.03]Sorcery.
[47:44.01]There was a sorcery meme in there from like 2015, 2016, whatever it was.
[47:48.85]That wasn't last year.
[47:53.24]That was not last year.
[47:54.30]That was like two years ago.
[47:59.21]uh but don't worry it's alright everything's gonna be fine everything's gonna be fine don't worry I promise promise you I promise everything's gonna be fine uh anyways thank you to thank you to techno toast for the 50 cents Jerma where the hell did you even get this plain girl visual novel
[48:24.25]Um, I don't know what that is.
[48:25.81]So I'm going to have, I'm going to have to look that up.
[48:27.25]I don't know what that means.
[48:32.90]Um, plain girl, visual novel.
[48:39.12]What does that mean?
[48:41.54]I'm not getting, I don't know.
[48:46.70]Uh, anyways, thank you though.
[48:50.12]Also, thank you to Toby for the bits.
[48:51.82]They say, no, no, no, I'm not reading that.
[48:55.46]Kappa.
[48:56.94]What are you not reading?
[48:57.64]I don't understand.
[48:59.08]Not reading that.
[49:02.31]I'm not reading that.
[49:05.85]Well, I mean, I don't know what you're trying not to read.
[49:10.67]But... Oh, no, there's one before that.
[49:13.42]And that one says... I've got to go all the way back down here.
[49:17.14]Hold on.
[49:18.68]Let me go all the way back.
[49:19.48]Let me go back down.
[49:21.90]I'm going to fix that.
[49:25.50]Where were we?
[49:26.67]We're going in descending.
[49:27.61]I'm going to go in ascending order here.
[49:34.71]Let's see.
[49:35.65]Right here.
[49:38.51]Travelboy, thank you for the $1.
[49:40.41]Can you give a reason other than, well, I don't want people to give me too much money that you don't let us donate to you directly?
[49:50.53]I mean, the easiest answer there is because Twitch is sort of a mediary, I can't sort of be held responsible if something bad happens from a receiving money perspective.
[50:08.87]So let's say somebody was just like, they gave me like five grand, right?
[50:13.43]You just gave me five grand, like just like a personal, here's a donation to your PayPal account, $5,000.
[50:22.26]I don't have like any mediary there.
[50:24.82]Where I can even necessarily even prove why or where I got it.
[50:28.83]And where it came from, kind of.
[50:29.87]You know what I mean?
[50:31.37]And sometimes people do a thing where they donate a bunch of money and then they do a chargeback.
[50:38.81]And I know that that's sort of been taken care of over the last couple of years.
[50:43.36]But at the same time, I don't even want to make it even a possibility.
[50:48.50]Twitch takes a huge cut.
[50:49.74]And here's another thing I was thinking I was going to do.
[50:52.81]I was probably eventually going to do, like if you really wanted to, because I'm like, you guys know this, I'm like super into like cryptocurrency right now.
[51:03.71]Forget about like the jokes, like bald coin and shit like that.
[51:07.07]I was thinking about making like a separate like BTC address maybe, and people could donate BTC if they wanted to as like, oh, crypto, oh, cool, cryptocurrency.
[51:15.85]But that didn't really go off the ground.
[51:20.85]Or maybe have like an Ethereum wallet that people could, if they wanted, if they really wanted to.
[51:27.74]But those BTC fees.
[51:30.10]Yeah.
[51:31.58]But, I don't know.
[51:35.22]I'd actually do it.
[51:37.04]Yeah, it was like a little, it was a small idea.
[51:39.82]But, let me just, I don't even know how you would even go about doing something like that.
[51:48.26]I don't know.
[51:49.22]But,
[51:50.01]You know what it is?
[51:51.85]I'm going to be as clear as I can and just be totally transparent here.
[51:57.00]Twitch bits give validity to a donation.
[52:02.25]So for like tax purposes, for instance, it's like, hey, this is just money that Twitch was the mediary for and I received from Twitch, right?
[52:12.19]Rather than, like, going to my CPA with, like, oh, yeah, here's, like, tons of money that people just gave me.
[52:18.73]It'd be, like, kind of, I don't know, I feel like it'd be strange.
[52:21.91]And then that's where, like, I guess Patreon comes into play, right?
[52:26.08]So, it is things, it is something I'm actually very, very heavily thinking about on a daily basis.
[52:33.54]So, don't get me wrong, I do think about it a lot.
[52:37.40]But that's okay.
[52:39.68]That is okay.
[52:42.13]uh I will work on it I promise I will give you guys potentially another avenue to give money and we can just go from there Patreon will probably just give me give me like a few weeks thank you though I appreciate the concern nonetheless you know anyways thank you to um
[53:07.94]And then you do stuff from thing for the $5.
[53:09.96]I love that there's always just crime bees everywhere in the game.
[53:13.54]Yeah.
[53:14.02]They were like... That was like one of my favorite things.
[53:16.08]People just laughing and talking shit about the bees.
[53:19.78]Some of you guys are fucking hilarious.
[53:22.85]TechnoToast again.

[54:05.00]Hey streamer, what happened to deleting jermaEarth? I sold all the bald coin and had- I was invested in, but now it looks like that was a waste.
[54:14.00]We're doing a meme funeral. A meme funeral. They're all going to get buried. I'll say a few words, and we can move on with our lives.
[54:21.00]That'll happen on either- if that doesn't happen on Tuesday then that's going to happen on Friday.
[54:26.00]It's gonna happen soon, I just have to get ready for it. I have to put on like a priest dress, what do they wear?

[54:57.26]Ow, that like hurts.
[54:58.78]That actually like hurts me.
[55:02.04]That like makes me feel bad.
[55:03.34]What was wrong with this stream?
[55:05.14]This stream was great.
[55:06.37]This stream was great.
[55:08.33]We had a bunch of laughs in the game.
[55:11.23]I did a fucking Barney Rubble joke.
[55:14.22]This has been one of the best of 2018.
[55:44.98]Best of two thou- I fucked it up.
[55:46.58]God damn it.
[55:47.46]Fucking idiot.
[55:50.09]I can't.
[55:50.35]I fucked it up.
[55:51.67]Now I do agree.
[55:52.23]This is the worst stream of 2018.
[55:53.95]If that actually worked, I would have disagreed with you.
[55:58.23]But you're right.
[56:02.57]This streamer is a joke.
[56:04.39]Get that fucking guy out of here.
[56:07.67]Forever.
[56:09.91]Thank you though to... Who even... I don't know.
[56:13.69]Somebody gave that money.
[56:15.80]Sort of gave that my own who the fuck it was though.

[56:44.90]ForusendElf, thanks for the $1.
[56:46.48]Jerma, will you ever play Infamous?
[56:48.00]Also, delete virus game.
[56:49.60]Infamous is actually on my Steam, like, list of games I would want to buy and play.
[56:54.22]So maybe eventually, maybe at some point when we have nothing else to do, maybe?
[56:59.55]You only play, you played a game for a bit.
[57:01.39]I mean, I played that for like two hours.
[57:04.15]Like two and a half hours.
[57:06.23]This is just like the wind down read bits portion of the stream because I had to end it early because I didn't think I was going to end the game that quickly.
[57:14.21]What is with the smoke filter?
[57:18.07]Okay, this is over.
[57:20.05]Now I just look like a creep.
[57:21.59]We're going to turn this off.

[61:02.05]Alright, let's, um, get rid of this.
[61:03.67]I'm just gonna leave it like this for the rest of the stream.
[61:07.54]Like, who cares?
[61:10.34]Right?
[61:10.58]Does it, like, really matter?
[61:11.42]Should I put a third one here, too?
