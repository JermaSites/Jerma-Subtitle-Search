[00:01.05]Hello there.
[00:01.53]How you doing?
[00:05.49]Good.
[00:08.51]Morning to you.
[00:09.33]Oh, good morning.
[00:09.91]Good, um... Good afternoon.
[00:14.03]Whatever time it is where you are.
[00:15.23]How are you?
[00:16.61]Hope you're doing a fantastic day.
[00:21.00]It's midnight.
[00:22.62]Good morning.
[00:23.26]I don't know why I said good morning.
[00:28.38]Good morning!
[00:34.10]Well, yeah, but it's like, it's like time zones exist.
[00:36.56]It's morning somewhere in the world.
[00:39.00]Always.
[00:42.20]It doesn't matter.
[00:42.80]It could be, it could be 10 o'clock at night for you and potentially 1 o'clock in the morning for me.
[00:53.03]It's 10.30 a.m.
[00:53.97]in Australia.
[00:54.67]That's who I was talking to.
[01:01.05]It was good indeed, 16 hours ago.
[01:04.75]Welcome back.
[01:05.65]We're doing more Mario Sunshine.
[01:08.88]Shoe eating stream.
[01:10.16]That's, yeah.
[01:11.64]I'm glad you made it.
[01:14.32]How did you know?
[01:14.92]I've got like four different shoes here on plates and shit.
[01:18.06]That's kind of weird.
[01:18.60]How would you know that?
[01:19.20]I was going to eat them all.
[01:21.60]Damn.
[01:31.81]One day, here's a list of ideas that I say that I'll never do, but I would like to, because right now I'm just spitballing this to you.
[01:42.98]What if I had, like, six or seven shoes, custom-made, out of edible licorice or something, and they looked very real.
[01:53.11]I'd pay, like, a lot of money to have these shoes look really fucking real.
[02:00.27]Like, and I ate them on stream.
[02:04.81]And pretended they were Willy Wonka.
[02:10.06]Like, lose a bet at some point in the stream.
[02:13.66]Now, this is exclusive to you guys.
[02:15.45]Because if I ever not, I'm never going to do this.
[02:17.57]If I ever do this, you guys will know.
[02:20.13]But an hour goes by in the stream, and I make a bet with you guys.
[02:23.15]And I'm like, oh, you know, fine, whatever.
[02:24.74]If I lose this bet, I'll eat fucking 10 shoes.
[02:28.18]And everyone would be like, what the fuck?
[02:29.56]And I lose it.
[02:30.24]And then here we go.
[02:30.82]The camera goes on.
[02:31.52]Everyone's going to eat shoes on March 12th?
[02:42.71]You can't put that there right now.
[02:44.19]That's not even real.
[02:49.28]Why does it have to be 10?
[02:50.50]I don't know.
[02:51.64]Why not?
[02:53.48]Welcome back.
[02:55.40]I have 26 shines in Mario Sunshine.
[03:02.32]I'm having a lot of fun.
[03:03.02]The game's great.
[03:09.27]Evidence.
[03:11.93]Hold on.
[03:12.27]What?
[03:16.27]Wait, I said I was going to do this already?
[03:18.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[03:21.35]Let me see.
[03:22.81]Did I actually say this like four months ago?
[03:25.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[03:40.22]So now I have to eat a shoe.
[03:43.68]This is like back, this is like a year ago.
[03:47.58]I just, I know that I said I was going to eat a full shoe on stream if Sans was confirmed.
[03:52.64]And, shoot.
[03:55.52]He was last yesterday.
[03:58.91]Oh, no.
[04:03.89]Why did I think this was, why did I know this was going to happen?
[04:07.53]I mean, smash.
[04:07.91]What do I say?
[04:08.73]I say it right here?
[04:17.25]March 12th.
[04:19.10]And so the shoe-eating stream will be on March 12th, 2020.
[04:26.76]Mark it on your calendar.
[04:30.30]You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[04:33.33]Alright, mark it on your calendar.
[04:38.83]Freddie Dredd gave 50 subs.
[04:44.89]Holy fuck, dude.
[04:47.11]Thanks for the 50 subs.
[04:49.43]ReadyDread coming in.
[04:51.97]I fucking have to eat a shoe.
[04:53.63]Yeah, alright.
[04:54.11]Well, fuck it.
[04:54.63]You know what I'm doing.
[04:56.55]I never lied about eating the shoe.
[04:57.95]No, did I?
[04:58.43]Uh, last time I looked at my calendar, it was not March 12th.
[05:02.29]It was March... I don't even know what... Days don't... There's no such thing as a day anymore in my brain.
[05:06.94]Only, like, weeks.
[05:08.56]Alright, so it's March 5th.
[05:11.64]I got plenty of fucking time to get a full shoe on stream.
[05:19.87]We had a wink?
[05:20.53]We actually did.
[05:21.07]Well, welcome back to Mario Sunshine.
[05:29.66]I'll give you a look, those of you that have not been around the last, uh... I was gonna say few days, but it was actually less than 24 hours ago.
[05:37.42]40 blue coins, 26 shines, and 0 regular coins.
[05:47.33]Where do I want to go?
[05:49.17]I'm just, I'm obsessed with collecting.
[05:53.78]But Freddy Dread.
[05:56.00]That was an absolute shitload of subs.
[05:59.20]Thank you for the ridiculous amount of subs.
[06:02.52]Wait, you did it again!
[06:03.52]You did it a second time?
[06:06.55]Like two, a minute ago?
[06:07.65]Oh my fucking god, Freddy.

[06:46.57]Yeah, I did.
[06:48.05]And then Austin Atlantis gave five community subs as well.
[06:50.78]Thank you, Austin Atlantis.
[06:55.84]I'm doing it.
[06:56.26]I'm going.
[07:02.96]I wish Nintendo would stop making bankable games and just make Chinko machines.
[07:07.63]Well, you say that, but over the next 10 to 15 years...
[07:11.89]Uh, all those, all those Betty White machines, and all those, like, look at the cute kitty cat slot machines, are gonna get replaced by Mario, Sonic, and, like, Solid Snake and shit.
[07:29.04]Timestamp this.
[07:30.36]Mark my words.
[07:34.66]That, like, the Elvis machines?
[07:36.69]Gone.
[07:37.11]All of them.
[07:38.57]The Alfred Hitchcock slot machine?
[07:40.89]All of them, gone.
[07:42.15]Replaced with Super Mario slot machines.
[07:44.93]Garen fucking Tid.
[07:45.75]Alright, where's the float?
[07:59.08]How am I feeling?
[07:59.96]I'm feeling alright.
[08:01.02]I'm feeling alright today.
[08:04.10]Alright, I'm sorry.
[08:06.44]I'll get it when it comes back.
[08:14.22]He's lying.
[08:15.00]Now, if you missed it yesterday for some... I don't... I... I have, like, fucking mystery pain around my whole body.
[08:22.44]Right?
[08:23.10]And... We already talked about it, but, like... I got... My, like, tongue started hurting yesterday.
[08:28.11]It was just weird, and it, like, kind of freaked me out for, like, ten minutes.
[08:32.01]But... Oh, my God!
[08:33.31]I missed it again!
[08:33.95]Okay, this is the equivalent.
[08:37.17]If I... If I was sitting there waiting for a bus... In real life...
[08:43.24]I'm on the phone like talking to my mom or something and the bus pulls up twice and I don't get on it.
[08:52.63]I gotta get on the fucking bus.
[08:53.87]I gotta get home.
[08:54.53]I gotta go home!
[08:57.87]Freddy Dredd, holy shit.
[08:59.11]200 bucks.
[08:59.27]20,000 bits from Freddy Dredd.
[09:02.53]100 community subs and $200 in bits.
[09:12.26]This is one of my favorite games.
[09:13.64]Thank you, Jerma, my man.
[09:15.95]This game's awesome.
[09:16.93]I've never played it.
[09:19.23]This is fucking crazy, man.
[09:20.73]Thank you.
[09:21.81]I gotta get on the bus.
[09:22.65]I have to get on the bus.
[09:30.95]I'm running behind the bus.
[09:33.67]No, stop.
[09:34.37]Please.
[09:35.21]Please.
[09:35.47]No, no, no.
[09:36.29]I'll get on.
[09:36.83]I'll get on.
[09:37.27]No.
[09:38.11]I gotta wait again.
[09:41.19]I have a memory of a fucking four-year-old.
[09:44.09]Just get on the boat now.
[09:48.79]Nocturne... Nocturne asked to turn a hundred bucks each shoe.
[09:54.56]Wait, I gotta get on the bus.
[09:55.78]Just wait a minute.
[09:59.88]Okay.
[10:03.30]Nocturne gave a hundred dollars.
[10:05.22]Remember I told you how red it was yesterday?
[10:08.48]Red and...
[10:11.17]There's a ton of more money now, like right now.
[10:13.59]There's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[10:17.03]Each shoe, March 12th.
[10:19.98]And don't, and hey, don't fucking... I'm gonna, I gotta trust you guys not to talk shit about this.
[10:26.04]Because if I get a custom-made edible shoe for March 12th, you bet your ass that you better not be telling anybody about that.
[10:38.30]You gotta be in on the joke.
[10:43.80]Alright, how many do I need?
[10:44.42]Eight?
[10:45.06]But thank you, both of you.
[10:46.12]Seriously.
[10:51.12]Leather is edible.
[10:54.12]If you think... ...or even one... ...one second... ...that I am going to eat... ...a shreal shoe on stream... ...and, like, die... ...you are crazy.
[11:15.45]Oh, this sucks.
[11:17.45]Alright.
[11:18.41]I know how to do it.
[11:19.59]I know how to do this.
[11:23.21]The ultimate joke.
[11:27.36]You gotta get in, like, right here.
[11:29.02]Alright, now, right there.
[11:32.92]Okay, nice.
[11:43.41]What the fuck was that?
[11:48.83]Okay.
[11:51.46]These are the worst ones.
[11:53.24]I gotta make sure the final one is one of the really easy ones up top.
[11:58.56]I need to see.
[11:59.00]Where am I going?
[12:00.49]Alright, there's one.
[12:01.23]I gotta get the ones up.
[12:05.49]I want to get the ones up top last.
[12:07.19]The star definitely goes in the middle.
[12:08.87]I am certain of that.
[12:19.84]Okay, there's only two more.
[12:21.34]I thought I just fell off the edge and I was supposed to be very... Okay, there's the one all the way in the end there.
[12:26.24]I gotta go for that one next.
[12:27.30]And then there's the last one is the one all the way to the right.
[12:33.38]I gotta get that one.
[12:35.46]Alright, make it easy.
[12:36.52]Let's go.
[12:48.07]This is the camera just...
[12:52.48]Fucking camera was just like a straight into the machine.
[12:55.52]I couldn't even see So have we determined is it impossible for me to do this
[13:21.85]Get in the corner, right there.
[13:26.36]Mario's kind of quirky.
[13:29.12]Yeah, he is.
[13:29.86]Very quirky.
[13:35.66]What are you doing?
[13:59.45]Get in there.
[14:00.91]Get in there!
[14:01.47]Come on!
[14:01.99]Push it!
[14:05.28]This is gonna get Jeremy floored.
[14:09.22]Wait, what?
[14:18.84]Why is that happening?
[14:20.34]Alright, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:21.66]Why is that happening?
[14:23.72]What the hell is that?
[14:24.90]Why can't I fly?
[14:25.84]Why is it pushing me?
[14:28.81]I just got the fucking thing.
[14:29.93]Alright, hold on.
[14:35.05]See?
[14:35.37]It's like shoving me to the right.
[14:40.80]I'm not pressing.
[14:41.42]It's just like tossing me over there.
[14:46.59]Dude, what the fuck?
[14:47.51]Dude.
[14:48.57]Dude.
[14:53.67]See, what the fuck was that?
[14:55.45]I have to jump to this one.
[15:02.75]I have to jump to that one.
[15:03.93]I have to.
[15:08.54]I have to do it like this.
[15:19.62]Because it doesn't... Even if you... This is really weird.
[15:24.96]Even if you jump over it, the game just decides it's going to throw you.
[15:28.86]Like, I'm not pressing... I'm in trouble.
[15:31.44]Holy fuck, that was close.
[15:34.09]Let go of the nozzle?
[15:45.35]Oh, goddammit.
[15:46.27]Get in there, please.
[15:48.78]Don't you fucking even think about it.
[15:55.50]Get in there, man!
[15:59.30]What the fuck?
[16:00.06]Somebody just gave me so many subs.
[16:02.34]Somebody had so many.
[16:04.64]That's a hundred subs.
[16:11.82]I'm almost out of fucking water, too.
[16:13.92]Hold on.
[16:14.30]Who just gave a hundred subs?
[16:17.35]Austin Atlantis gave 100 community subs.
[16:21.29]That's like a trillion dollars.
[16:25.90]Holy shit, dude.
[16:28.06]Thanks for the 100 subs, and to those of you who got one, nice.
[16:33.73]I'm almost out of water.
[16:38.13]I'm so paranoid.
[16:42.85]Oh, that's it.
[16:53.80]Alright, new strategy is go for the one on the left first, because that one's just the hardest one to get.
[16:59.56]Start crying, right now.
[17:01.18]Cry, now.
[17:14.33]There's more subs.
[17:16.97]I got it, I got it, okay, I got it.
[17:19.53]Another 25 from Freddy Dredd.
[17:24.04]Holy shit.
[17:28.36]You guys are going fucking crazy.
[17:30.70]I got the whole left side.
[17:31.90]I got the wrong thing selected.
[17:42.63]How does that happen?
[17:47.30]What?
[17:47.56]Huh?
[17:52.68]Did I just go through the wall?
[17:58.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:05.74]What?
[18:06.28]I thought you couldn't do that.
[18:09.22]There is no wall.
[18:10.08]I thought there was a, wait, there's not a back wall?
[18:12.96]What the fuck?
[18:13.74]I'm trying, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:15.96]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[18:17.99]There's a glass back wall, isn't there?
[18:20.71]Like an invisible wall?
[18:22.17]How do you not fly out?
[18:25.89]I can't believe I got the hard one too.
[18:28.03]What?
[18:32.93]There is in some places.
[18:36.69]What the fuck?
[18:43.07]Don't miss the bus.
[18:47.40]What the hell was that?
[18:48.48]I thought I was gonna just slide down like I always do out the back.
[18:55.58]You mean you're telling me I can fall out that way?
[18:57.38]And also, alright, hold on.
[19:05.94]It's also like, okay, I'm missing the bus.
[19:08.14]Yes, but I'm taking my eyes off the screen.
[19:10.80]But you have to remember, I'm not alone.
[19:12.45]I'm waiting at the bus stop.
[19:14.15]And somebody's driving by the bus stop every few minutes and they're throwing $500 off the window.
[19:20.27]And I'm like, whoa, do I get on the bus?
[19:22.05]Should I get on the bus?
[19:23.77]Hold on, let me...
[19:25.03]I gotta get that money, hold on, fuck the bus!
[19:29.07]And like 10 more minutes go by, like another person's just like, hey, hey buddy!
[19:33.14]And like throws like $200 out the window.
[19:35.60]I'm just like, holy shit, that's fine, I gotta get that money!
[19:45.56]This bus... I got people driving behind the bus, tossing fucking checks at it.
[19:59.63]Alright, I'm getting on.
[20:00.31]I'm getting on.
[20:00.79]I'm getting on.
[20:01.27]I can't believe I can fall out the back.
[20:02.61]Hold on.
[20:03.35]Wait a minute.
[20:05.23]I'm so tilted from what just happened.
[20:07.32]I'm so fucking mad from falling out the back fucking window.
[20:10.90]I can't believe this is even possible.
[20:12.20]You can't fall out the front.
[20:13.86]Why can you fall out the back?
[20:28.44]the bus.
[20:30.20]Oh my goodness.
[20:31.82]Why did I say I would do this level?
[20:33.69]This is like the joke meme level that nobody does.
[20:36.47]They spend five minutes on this level and they go, nah, I'm just gonna play the fucking actual video game.
[20:57.25]I don't care who did it.
[21:00.78]Guess what?
[21:01.52]LeBron James can dunk.
[21:04.34]I don't go, you know, I'm going to dunk first try, too.
[21:07.16]Give me that ball, LeBron.
[21:36.60]And I go to dunk on LeBron, and he fucking does like the most embarrassing, just like smash the ball out of my hand.
[21:46.71]And he, it does, it's so hard, it's so hard that it's like, boop boop, hits me like right in the nose.
[21:51.79]And I'm like, oh, my nose like blows up with blood and shit, and I have to go to like the hospital.
[21:55.90]I don't care.
[22:05.12]Wait, you met LeBron?
[22:14.51]You're getting dunked on.
[22:28.79]This is fucking so stupid.
[22:45.37]Stop grabbing the wall!
[22:46.77]Let go of the wall!
[22:49.91]Why?!
[22:51.87]What are you doing?!
[22:52.89]Okay.
[22:52.99]I figured it out.
[22:54.17]I know what to do.
[23:15.11]Although that was... You can fall off the fucking edge!
[23:18.28]Don't do that!
[23:19.18]Okay, that kind of doesn't work.
[23:53.94]This is so fucking ridiculous.
[23:58.94]Fuck.
[24:02.22]It's gonna work if I get it.
[24:30.48]No matter if the game is horseshit, I still made it work.
[24:33.54]Just throws you to the right, no matter what.
[24:35.32]Alright, I gotta get the ones on the right.
[24:45.07]Okay, I got it.
[24:46.91]Don't fuck it up.
[24:55.61]One more.
[25:21.98]I'm preparing.
[25:27.62]Here we go.
[25:41.53]It's not over yet.
[25:42.35]It's not over yet.
[25:43.61]Not over yet.
[25:46.99]It's not over yet.
[25:47.57]I have to get in there.
[26:00.23]Do it again, do it again, just relax, do it again Ah, do it again
[26:29.97]I don't want to... I'm holding the ball right now.
[26:32.27]I got LeBron's in front of me and he's laughing.
[26:35.29]He's like, you're going to try again.
[26:37.13]Yeah.
[26:41.45]In a minute.
[26:43.17]Alright.
[26:43.49]Whenever you're ready, man.
[26:44.89]Whenever you're ready to go.
[26:45.67]Hold on a second.
[26:47.41]I'm just trying to figure out which way to go.

[29:58.85]Oh, I know.
[30:10.91]I got them all.
[30:11.51]I did get them all.
[30:12.85]I did get them all at Gelato Beach.
[30:14.39]I remember this one.
[30:16.63]Well, you can't back out for some reason.
[30:23.30]Why can't you knock back out of this menu?
[30:29.60]Press Z to see the levels you beat.
[30:31.28]Oh.
[30:32.91]Imagine if your memory card got corrupt.
[30:38.01]Oh, there's a hundred coins.
[30:39.55]I don't need to do that.
[30:45.88]Alright, I got five.
[30:47.08]What do I have the lowest?
[30:49.36]Eight at Gelato Beach.
[30:51.69]Five... I think I have... Oh, the park.
[30:56.49]I only have one at... in a park.
[30:58.36]Alright, we're going to the park.
[31:00.68]I gotta go in the cannon though, right?
[31:12.80]I don't know why they didn't add that.
[31:35.56]That should be the noise he's making.
[31:52.38]Here we go.
[31:53.08]The beach cannon's secret.
[31:54.59]That was a middle school joke.
[31:57.81]Shut up.
[31:58.93]Shut up.
[31:59.69]Shut up.
[32:00.59]Shut up.

[32:26.92]No, I don't.
[32:30.32]Come on, how long have you been watching this channel?
[32:36.55]I've already told you guys that 98% of everything you hear on this channel is fabricated.
[32:40.79]Okay.

[34:33.67]I don't know why.
[34:34.35]I just blacked out.
[34:35.03]I forgot.
[34:37.31]I'm blacking out.
[34:37.91]Alright, here we go.

[35:39.88]What is it?

[35:42.54]Why does this feel so strange?
[35:55.17]Like, what's this air pushing me?

[36:38.28]This air, like, moving me like left and right.
[36:41.56]Alright.
[36:54.57]Break the crates.
[36:58.15]It's your emulator.
[37:01.60]No, this isn't the original... You know... Why would you go up there?
[37:09.70]They have this copy protection on the disc.
[37:21.25]That's weird.
[37:22.44]Alright.
[37:23.60]Here we go.
[37:24.04]I'm gonna count.

[38:09.53]Holy fuck.
[38:10.51]Okay, we're good.
[38:19.66]Hey, this one's for free.
[38:26.61]I stopped doing the TikTok thing.
[38:27.81]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[38:29.07]Turn up the game volume?
[38:43.99]Nah.
[38:44.93]Yeah, sure.
[38:45.23]How's that?
[38:48.33]Better?
[38:59.97]Apologize.
[39:00.67]What's this one?
[39:07.69]Red Coins of the Pirate Ships.
[39:10.61]Cool.
[39:14.95]Somebody has a name called Tag Me When Jerma's Upset.
[39:17.48]That's just... See, now you're just gaming the system.
[39:27.68]Now you're just getting all these tags.
[39:41.29]The chat is devolving.
[39:42.60]It's alright, it's alright.
[39:45.36]Alright, we gotta get up there.
[39:49.56]Do I ride the teacups?
[39:57.36]That's kinda fun.
[40:02.75]Red coin.
[40:03.33]Alright, get on the pirate ship.
[40:07.20]Ooh, okay.
[40:07.98]So, any more red coins on the ship?
[40:11.18]Okay.
[40:15.82]Uh, a cross.
[40:16.62]Oops.
[40:19.83]I hit my head.
[40:20.53]Whatever.
[40:34.13]Nintendo is watching?
[40:36.09]Oh, well, that's good.
[40:37.95]Nintendo, when are you going to put this game somewhere else besides a GameCube disc?
[40:44.85]It's probably one of the top three Mario games you've made.
[40:48.71]Oh, they left... Oh, well.
[40:53.88]Oh, shit, I didn't... That was...
[41:05.24]Like, no Wii U port, no Switch port, no eShop.
[41:10.07]Where's the GameCube eShop shit?
[41:14.17]That's another question.
[41:22.30]Well, that was... Still got it.
[41:31.04]Alright, now from here... I gotta go... Oh my god.
[41:35.18]I'm gonna go this way.
[41:38.17]And I missed it.
[41:40.15]And I fuckin' missed it.
[41:41.35]How?
[41:53.19]Oh, it's just exhausting.
[41:55.14]Hold on, my, like, hands are sweating.
[42:02.22]Do you know who would make a trillion dollars if you made a controller?
[42:05.62]Is there, like, any anti-sweat controllers?
[42:07.38]Alright.
[42:09.14]Let me- First, let me stop speaking so I can play the video game.
[42:11.48]Like, why do these things have to be made of this hard, sweat plastic?
[42:18.95]Why can't this be made of a cloth or something?
[42:20.59]Like, I- I- I want a cloth that I can change out.
[42:22.95]Like, you do your laundry, you do- I give a fucking pillowcase.
[42:26.02]Why can't- Why does it not control a pillowcase?
[42:38.35]I'm doing this so wrong.
[42:39.47]Just go across.
[42:40.17]I don't need the boats anymore.
[42:48.38]Wait.
[42:49.40]Can I get in here?
[43:08.14]That's a 5,000 IQ coin.
[43:12.26]Oh, I'll get another one.
[43:12.86]Do you need gamer gloves?
[43:19.87]No, but that's... that makes it worse.
[43:21.55]Alright, we got a good view.
[43:31.21]What the fuck are you doing?
[43:33.19]Get out of my way!
[43:34.31]Blue shell fucker!
[43:37.48]I hate you!
[43:45.17]Oh, fucking Nintendo Wii Mario Kart.
[43:48.11]It's coming for me.
[43:48.63]Alright, I gotta get up there.
[43:59.55]I think I do have to go on the... Yeah, I have to get on these.
[44:02.93]And then just not miss.
[44:03.93]Can I do it from here?
[44:05.75]Mmm, maybe.
[44:07.79]Can I walk?
[44:17.10]Hold on.
[44:25.06]I think I can just do it from here.
[44:25.90]As long as I'm not stupid about this.
[44:33.68]oh why is this game running at 12 with track ps
[45:00.99]Dude, your PC sucks.
[45:02.41]I'm not on the PC!
[45:05.73]Does this guy move?
[45:17.45]This guy don't move, does he?
[45:24.41]Well, shit.
[45:26.93]I have to, like, hover over there.
[45:28.09]Okay, we'll go back up.
[45:38.13]Can I just shock him and then ground pound him?
[45:52.07]This camera's gonna make me throw up.
[45:53.69]Okay.
[46:03.90]Now I can get those.
[46:08.06]Or can I?
[46:08.50]I need water.
[46:09.44]Or else I'm not going to be able to get up here.
[46:18.27]This is going to be bad.
[46:35.13]Okay.
[46:36.01]I think I can grab these without needing to fill water.
[46:42.04]Let's see.
[46:45.44]Come on!
[46:46.55]Grab it!
[46:47.11]What?
[46:47.55]What the fuck?! !
[47:08.08]Okay.
[47:08.44]Do it again.
[47:13.92]Where are the other five coins, though?
[47:19.70]All the way up.
[47:23.53]This level might be the worst place for the camera.
[47:26.03]It's just in a building every five seconds.
[47:43.15]God damn it.
[47:44.05]I can't see anything.
[47:45.57]Just... I want to get in the... I want to get in the fairy go round.
[47:50.92]Whatever this thing is called.
[47:52.02]Holy shit, Nintendo.
[48:23.06]I'm terribly sorry, but this ride is currently under maintenance.
[48:36.00]Wow, Nintendo.
[48:37.21]Wow.
[48:38.35]The fucking game... Whatever.
[48:40.23]I don't even need to say it.
[48:51.16]I need to get over there.
[48:52.30]I think I can just get there.
[48:54.18]Can I put you out?
[49:05.72]I gotta get rid of you.
[49:20.12]I'm trying to hold the thing down.
[49:21.60]I didn't hold it down hard enough, so I move.
[49:24.13]Oh, it's frustrations settling in.
[49:55.96]Mad at children's games.
[49:57.22]Somebody told me I was going to get really mad here.
[50:00.33]They were like, I can't wait till he does this level.
[50:01.93]This level sucks.
[50:03.13]And I was like, what is he talking about?
[50:04.27]Smoke Super Mario Sunshine.
[50:34.31]Grab it!
[50:54.44]Why can't you be more like your brother?
[50:59.36]He's not here right now.
[51:00.39]He's at school.
[51:04.14]Alright, how do I... There's two more coins.
[51:14.70]Where the fuck are they?
[51:21.80]Where's my... I can't spend my blue coins to get a red coin scanner?
[51:28.18]All the way up.
[51:31.06]Do I have to... I gotta go over there.
[51:34.97]Alright, I'm going for it.
[51:35.81]I'm gonna be smart about this, though.
[51:41.68]Or are we?
[51:42.38]We'll find out.
[51:57.77]Can I punch him from below?
[52:04.20]Okay, if I electrocute them and push them... Can I... Will they... Do I get electrocuted by them if they... If they're over me?
[52:14.24]Well, he's gonna shock me, right?
[52:15.30]I thought they shocked you.
[52:16.74]Alright, now I gotta get on that thing.
[52:41.62]Pack them from below?
[52:42.44]I don't want to talk to them, they're electrified!
[52:54.26]I didn't like that.
[52:56.08]What do you thoughts on Mario Kart 9?
[53:00.24]Um...
[53:05.21]Which one is that?
[53:05.79]There's been so many of them.
[53:08.39]All I know is Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart Wii, and then all of them are the same game in my brain.
[53:17.80]The ninth one.
[53:18.64]Yeah, but which one is that?
[53:19.92]How many have there been?
[53:20.66]How many Mario Karts are there?
[53:23.54]There's eight?
[53:30.57]9.
[53:31.29]Double dash?
[53:32.67]Yeah, I know, but how many are there?
[53:35.84]It's 8 Deluxe.
[53:38.54]It's 14?
[53:41.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:42.62]Mario... Mario Kart.
[53:44.42]How many Mario Karts are there?
[53:47.58]Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch.
[53:49.97]Yeah, it's 8.
[53:50.71]I wasn't even looking at the fucking screen!
[53:55.19]Again!
[53:55.57]God damn it, I'm like looking up shit on Google.
[54:07.78]How do I move this?
[54:10.80]Can I, like, push this?
[54:11.80]Pull it?
[54:13.14]Can't grab this?
[54:15.24]Stomp it?
[54:20.83]Open that!
[54:24.67]Hey, I think you're in need of a pair of my special sunshades!
[54:27.59]Oh, well, then again, maybe you're not ready.
[54:29.39]You need to spend a bit more time here.
[54:32.97]How much more time do I need to spend here?
[54:34.13]I've been here for, like, I've been here for, like, four days!
[54:40.57]What about you?
[54:43.28]I brought this baby to view the sunflowers, but this looks unsafe.
[54:54.97]I didn't think Yoshis were bad creatures, that's for sure.
[54:57.53]Yep.
[54:57.75]Yep.
[54:58.47]Yep.
[55:14.08]Wait, this is... There are actually Yoshis here?
[55:15.54]That's not a Yoshi!
[55:22.30]That's a hermit crab!
[55:27.46]Whoa.
[55:39.90]Oh, they're draining the fertilizer from the ground.
[55:43.25]They're drinking all the fertilizer and the water.
[55:45.17]Hey, wake up.
[56:02.53]Alright, bring another one up.
[56:06.13]Back to life.
[56:08.93]Plant plant plant plant plant here we go Point point point Nope don't think so
[56:41.03]Why are you doing this?
[56:41.69]Is one life worth more than another?
[56:43.52]I don't make the rules in Super Mario.
[56:57.77]Nobody's dying, don't you guys know?
[57:00.93]They're going away.
[57:08.85]They're all on vacation.
[57:15.87]Over here.
[57:20.11]What?
[57:24.02]What happened there?
[57:42.03]Oh, you didn't spin around.
[57:43.52]Alright, do it.
[57:50.34]Hey.
[57:51.92]Oh, you're not... Over here.
[57:54.78]Aha.
[57:55.32]You can't do anything about the sand, can you?
[57:57.22]Oh, I gotta be quicker than that, huh?
[58:03.70]Alright, let's bring you back to life.
[58:11.27]Yes.
[58:16.64]That one was not even that bad.
[58:29.37]I see people on speedruns do that.
[58:30.83]I can't do it.
[58:31.73]They do it like backwards into the thing.
[58:44.01]Beat Dark Souls 3 on stream, but you can't beat a single Mario game.
[58:47.07]I'm gonna beat, I'm beating this right now.
[58:48.89]Look, don't you see on your screen?
[58:50.49]Okay, let's move.
[59:04.04]Hurry, Mario.
[59:06.58]I can't imagine what the poor princess is going through.
[59:08.84]Mario, please save her.
[59:10.96]Hey, Moni!
[59:29.98]Hey, you!
[59:31.30]Give me that Yoshi egg!
[59:40.45]What the fuck?
[59:41.11]He was in my way!
[59:42.89]He was in my way!
[59:45.75]Wait, what is that?
[59:46.85]Go on!
[59:52.36]Oh, this is what was supposed to happen.
[60:03.89]Give me that fucking egg!
[60:18.71]Oh!
[60:18.99]He missed it.
[60:19.77]Good.
[60:20.14]You're just as stupid as me.
[60:23.06]You really are a Mario clone.
[60:31.04]He's trying to hit the same jump, but can't hit it.
[60:35.90]He's like, well, whatever.
[60:36.96]And he's just about to ride that Yoshi, too.
[60:43.01]He needs bananas.
[60:49.73]I don't want to get those.
[60:53.26]Stay right here, Yoshi.
[60:54.02]I got this.
[61:14.62]Here's your food!
[61:19.22]Ooh!
[61:21.04]You want some water?
[61:28.09]You befriended Yoshi, make him eat with B!
[61:29.99]Holy shit, I didn't even know Yoshi was in this game!
[61:52.49]Yoshi's- Wait, I'm orange?
[62:10.50]Okay, so you can- What do I want to be?
[62:15.18]Juice.
[62:17.92]Look at how long his tongue is in this game.
[62:35.85]Alright, I get another one, right?
[62:37.02]There's an egg over here?
[62:41.52]Okay, there is.
[62:47.40]No, that's such an old joke at this point, but it's still funny.
[62:52.96]Alright, let's go get some food.
[62:54.85]And that's, ah, this is cool.
[62:58.09]Whoa!

[63:50.27]Red coins on the water.
[63:55.85]Why can Yoshi not go in there?
[63:56.77]The room isn't paying attention to cutscenes.
[64:05.64]There's no dogs allowed.
[64:06.78]Yoshi's not a dog.
[64:10.60]He's a lizard.
[64:13.21]Hey, Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs, Kazzy.

[64:57.04]Yes, I did.

[69:10.47]He's up there.

[70:46.78]Can this fucking hit him?
[70:49.25]Why is this not hitting him?
[71:03.46]What on Earth is happening?
[71:05.14]Are you seriously moving all the way over there?
[71:19.83]Mom, my game's broken!

[71:46.74]This game makes me thirsty.
[71:47.68]This game makes me want to pee.
[71:50.36]This game makes me have to piss.
[71:52.82]That actually was the original title of the stream, but people were upset by it, so I had to get rid of it.
[71:56.50]Damn it.
[72:14.20]Alright, I made it.
[72:15.84]Does it wink?

[72:33.90]Why?
[72:35.16]Best level, worst level.
[72:36.58]This level sucks.
[72:37.55]Does it suck?
[72:49.28]Um... This place looks like a modded Call of Duty Zombies level.
[73:00.77]Hey, mister, I think you could spare us a hand.
[73:05.06]This dear lady's pets have decided to go on a little rampage.
[73:08.64]No, no, no, no, not the bees.

[73:50.62]Do they have to go back in a cage or anything?
[74:01.94]Is it that I'm trying to get them back in their pen or something?
[74:12.67]Try cooling its head off.
[74:13.73]I just did.
[74:18.21]Okay.

[74:29.51]How many are there?
[74:30.07]Two?
[74:30.33]Three?
[74:39.93]None of them are here.
[74:40.79]Okay, now what?
[74:55.25]I... Well... Okay.

[75:53.62]What are you?
[75:54.12]Stupid idiot.
[75:54.86]Do it.
[76:00.29]There's two more.
[76:02.75]I don't hate this place.
[76:03.85]Am I going to hate this place?
[76:04.93]I don't hate this place.
[76:19.23]Wait, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[76:21.09]I didn't get it.
[76:21.49]Now, stop, stop, stay right there.
[76:23.17]Don't move.
[76:32.27]OK, one more.

[76:44.78]Something like that.
[76:47.95]There you are, come here.
[76:50.75]Come here.
[77:01.29]Nope.
[77:02.27]I used to do that all the time versus Bowser in Mario 64.
[77:06.67]You would do that and miss and then you'd fucking fly off a cliff and smash the controller into the ground and it would explode into like 5,000 pieces.
[77:12.26]Why am I saying mama?
[77:32.13]Come here.
[77:34.05]You have to go this way.
[77:35.59]Alright, got a clear shot.
[77:38.17]Eight ball, corner pocket, and go.
[77:43.57]Yeah, that was like a wicked annoying thing to say.
[77:49.59]I'm aware.
[77:50.09]Eight ball, corner pocket.
[77:57.46]Yeah, I know that was annoying, but whatever.
[78:10.00]You guys just have no idea how exhausting it is to pretend.
[78:12.73]Every day.
[78:14.21]I brought this up yesterday.
[78:15.03]It's not that I'm exhausted.
[78:16.43]What's it been, an hour?
[78:17.91]God, I'm fucking so tired.
[78:25.01]Remember, to pretend in every video game, one hour of pretending is actually like two to three hours of being normal.
[78:35.22]I'm exerting 300% more mental fortitude.
[78:39.12]Man, I'm just fucking tired.
[78:42.98]Let's go back in.
[78:52.42]Oh no, it's a race.
[79:07.90]I feel bad with people that don't know that's a joke and they're just like what the fuck man It's me paintissimo and now listen see that flag over there I
[79:29.68]That flag up there.
[79:30.90]Are you ready?
[79:32.02]Three, two, one, go!
[79:34.61]Three, two, go!
[80:07.24]I didn't even know why this is the first time I've been on the level guys.
[80:10.20]I don't speak cursive.
[80:33.67]Actually, cursive sounds like this.
[80:37.53]If I was speaking cursive, it would sound like this.
[80:38.58]Every single word, every single... Everything would fall right into each other.
[80:43.90]Every single word would be at the beginning of any sentence.
[80:47.24]That's correct.
[80:59.15]Oh, the cracks kicking in.
[81:00.29]Cracks kicking in.
[81:01.23]Cracks kicking in.
[81:02.11]Cracks kicking in.
[81:04.09]Three, two, one.
[81:07.47]Go!
[81:13.97]Smelly letter.
[81:16.44]Kick head!
[81:25.44]Don't do that, just run!
[81:30.59]Stop!
[81:41.34]Oh, that was not so bad.
[81:42.40]You're quick, yes.
[81:44.42]I suppose maybe I underestimated you a small bit, perhaps.
[81:47.23]You try again after you have practiced more.
[81:48.97]Until then... Buh-bye.
[81:51.11]Damn it!
[82:21.85]Go to the hotel, go to the hotel.
[82:24.05]I don't know what that is.
[82:25.65]Don't stop spoiling the game.
[82:27.81]You're spoiling the game for me.
[82:31.57]I don't know what that is.
[82:32.81]You just ruined it.
[82:33.93]How am I gonna enjoy the game ever again now?
[82:40.98]I wanna do this again.
[82:46.32]Goopy Inferno.
[82:51.01]Uh-oh.
[83:04.98]All the way.
[83:09.36]No flood.
[83:09.94]Just my skills as a platform gamer.
[83:20.61]It's really tough being mayor, don't you think?
[83:23.29]I've never been a mayor.
[83:24.01]I have no idea.
[83:25.31]It might be really easy, for all I know.
[83:29.73]Alright, what do I gotta get up there?
[83:31.35]Fine.
[83:37.90]Um, okay.
[83:47.34]Okay.
[83:53.35]Okay.
[83:55.85]Well, there's... Alright, so maybe you want to hear a coin.
[84:00.55]When are you going to do Animal Crossing New Leaf?
[84:07.80]I've played the new one.
[84:13.90]What's going on?
[84:16.32]Nintendo.
[84:18.61]Nintendo.
[84:19.87]I need you to... Thank you.
[84:24.91]Can I get up there?
[84:25.81]Can I climb the tree?
[84:37.15]I can go over there.
[84:43.66]I'm just gonna...
[84:53.84]I have to jump on these guys' heads.
[84:59.96]Kind of.
[85:04.37]You're hurting him.
[85:12.21]Do I have to just bounce?
[85:13.79]I don't know.
[85:16.74]That almost worked.
[85:17.50]Almost.
[85:21.14]I'm not done with this.
[85:21.80]I'm having a fun time.
[85:25.83]That face when Mario isn't there to save you.
[85:27.99]Because you are Mario.
[85:30.56]Who saves Mario?
[85:57.57]Guys, Mario's not invincible.
[85:59.15]I mean, just because he has a series of video games doesn't mean that if he gets hit by a car, he's not gonna break all of his bones and shit.
[86:11.38]I have to bounce on these.
[86:12.38]So I'm gonna try.
[86:20.26]If I could do it, it'd be nice.
[86:31.80]They go all the way over there.
[86:32.76]Can I ride on these things?
[86:45.46]None of them are made out of water or anything?
[86:48.42]Wink?
[86:48.84]Alright, fine.
[87:02.46]Here's water.
[87:03.20]What about down here?

[87:30.29]But, where do I go?
[87:32.51]Up from here.
[87:35.99]How do I climb this up?
[87:37.89]Oh, wait, I can move this thing?

[89:40.66]I can't just grab?
[89:51.48]I have to jump up into it.
[89:56.08]Shit, I just said the fucking Voldemort name.

[100:18.33]It was this paper, thin, floating silhouette.
[100:21.69]It came and covered the hotel grounds in this electric goop.
[100:25.14]Then, oh, the horror.
[100:25.88]My beautiful hotel, my poor building.

[108:41.06]That was kind of fun.
[108:54.04]Save it.
[109:04.02]I'm just not even going to look.
[109:04.94]Should I just throw it behind me?
[109:07.06]I mean, I'm like half court.

[110:06.22]But it didn't swish?
[110:09.31]What?
[110:15.06]It was supposed to swish.
[110:23.81]I missed.
[110:25.45]I missed each time.
[110:27.17]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:28.95]Redo, redo, redo.
[110:30.51]That means I missed.

[111:01.42]What?
[111:02.08]How?
[111:02.82]I just got in.
[111:03.62]It doesn't go in and come out.
[111:09.42]No, I want... What the fuck, man?
[111:14.63]Why is it so hard to find this?
[111:25.80]Basketball swish.
[111:27.06]Why is this so difficult to get this?
[111:28.90]Somebody make this video and you'll get like 10,000 views.
[111:34.29]Just make a swish sound if I put it on YouTube.
[111:35.83]You'll get like 100,000 views.
[111:38.95]Okay, finally found it.
[111:40.11]Never mind.
[111:40.45]Thanks for uploading that.
[111:41.98]God damn it.
[111:42.52]I'm holding on to this.
[111:43.14]I don't fucking care.
[111:46.18]I'm holding on to that.
[111:57.95]Christ.
[112:01.71]Oh, here's a swish.
[112:02.43]It was a basketball fucking bouncing and hitting a ribbon shit.
[112:06.31]Because I can't hear it.
[112:07.35]I just have... Right now I have the game audio in my ears.
[112:10.57]I can't have both because the way that it's... The game is captured.
[112:13.66]Fuck.
[112:24.22]Whatever.
[112:27.01]Alright, let's go in the hotel.
[112:33.39]It's Mario, right?
[112:34.23]Yeah, Mario.
[112:35.64]Listen, I have a feeling you can help me out again.
[112:38.42]See the hotel?
[112:39.10]It's full of ghosts.
[112:40.82]This is a Mario... Wait.
[112:42.14]Does Luigi's Mansion tie in or something?
[112:45.80]So we... Well, could you maybe look... Just come inside.
[112:49.53]I can tell you're a miracle worker.
[112:50.53]Don't be so modest.
[112:53.99]When did the original Luigi's Mansion come out?
[113:04.84]They turn into platforms.
[113:09.21]Oh boy.
[113:10.05]This is going to be interesting.
[113:15.17]This is the Mario 64 place.
[113:18.03]This looks just like it.
[113:36.51]Hey!
[113:39.85]Can I go in here?
[113:40.37]Do I need the thing to run through the doors?
[113:53.40]Maybe I should talk to the guy first.
[113:57.80]Hold on.
[114:00.32]Fire.
[114:05.34]Wait, I can actually open the doors.
[114:09.69]Nope.
[114:11.65]You're invading somebody's privacy.
[114:13.09]There's nobody in this hotel.
[114:15.07]I'm the cleaning person.
[114:25.86]None of these open.
[114:36.65]Alright, dude.
[114:37.81]I can't help you.
[114:38.37]You gotta help me.
[114:40.73]Give me the key.
[114:44.09]At this rate, I'll never get back home.
[114:45.95]Can you do something, please, Mario?
[114:51.86]Well, I'll try.
[114:52.90]No guarantees.
[114:54.44]Is this a toilet?
[115:03.93]Oh, they're dirty toilets.
[115:08.53]Wait, these are not dirty toilets.
[115:17.95]They just look like that.
[115:20.43]Oh.
[115:29.57]What else is in here?
[115:36.48]Shit decal.
[115:42.34]This place looks like a fucking bowling alley.
[115:44.85]Why?
[115:45.69]No, it doesn't.
[115:51.25]Um, alright, so should I... What do I do here?
[115:54.81]Is it like a fire flower or something?
[116:04.73]Maybe go up higher?
[116:14.03]Okay, will we go higher?
[116:15.15]Oh, there's another.
[116:23.92]Okay.
[116:24.48]Well, it was a little confusing.
[116:28.68]That should not be in the game.
[116:29.66]That shouldn't be in the game.
[116:30.34]That's like unfair and it messes you up and makes you think that there's coins and shit.
[116:34.36]It's unfair.
[116:35.99]They should take this out of the game.
[116:45.99]Are they all closed?
[116:54.93]Oh, look.
[116:55.21]It's Pac-Man.
[116:55.91]Hold on.
[116:59.13]Anything else over here?
[117:08.72]Oh.
[117:08.80]You have that in you, though.
[117:09.76]Doesn't that mean you have that?
[117:12.26]Oh, come on.
[117:13.02]I just got so joked.
[117:16.98]I got joked.
[117:24.53]Well, let's go in.
[117:25.21]See what happens.
[117:27.33]Three, two, one.
[117:29.85]Here we go.
[117:32.20]The secret level.
[117:34.42]Oh, great.
[117:36.66]This is gonna be fun.
[117:41.53]I love the background.
[117:42.19]That's the kind of shit that I want in my office.
[117:46.51]Those lights.
[117:48.47]What are they called?
[117:50.50]Light brights.
[117:51.94]Light bright.
[117:59.16]What?
[118:00.12]Oh, I can break these.
[118:01.18]What?
[118:03.97]I gotta be careful, I don't want to break too many of them.
[118:10.38]What's the watermelon for?
[118:16.18]I think I may have just made a mistake.
[118:23.54]No, I'm okay, right?
[118:30.16]Alright, bounce, and just make it take a slow.
[118:33.32]Okay, that's sand.
[118:36.62]It's gonna fall.
[118:41.13]Just go.
[118:42.87]Waiting too long.
[118:43.75]You're probably asking yourself, why are you leaving that?
[118:56.15]Because I could have, see?
[118:58.53]That could have been bad.
[119:03.84]Which way?
[119:06.22]Okay, there's the psycho way.
[119:09.22]I'm thinking about going the psycho route.
[119:11.92]Psycho route is get to the second one here and then jump all the way over to the right side.
[119:16.59]I'm doing the psycho route.
[119:21.49]I almost had it.
[119:28.19]It was close.
[119:28.61]It just went a little too far.
[119:33.95]Oh, I can get it.
[119:34.93]I can get the Psycho Route.
[119:45.57]I can do this an infinite amount of times, though.
[119:47.68]That's the one good thing.
[119:57.18]Get that camera in a good spot.
[120:03.32]wow
[120:36.13]Alright So just But I can't reach that The platform the move that shit move That shit moves right

[121:37.29]God, come on.
[121:38.17]That was such a pain in the ass to get over there with the psycho route.
[121:56.37]Saved it.
[121:57.07]I almost fucked it up.
[122:11.43]Alright.
[122:34.60]There we go.
[122:36.77]Alright.
[122:37.79]I just have to jump.
[122:39.15]Don't walk over it.
[122:39.95]If you walk over it, you go all the way over the edge.
[122:44.85]Just be careful.
[122:46.92]Get that.
[123:07.23]HOLY SHIT!
[123:11.83]HOLY SHIT!

[123:45.85]The same thing is with video games When you throw a punch in karate you need to exhale ha Same thing when you're playing a game you want to make a jump

[124:00.26]Tennis is another one.
[124:01.24]Yeah.
[124:03.38]This is true.
[124:03.90]This is a true statement.

[124:16.94]Pitchers do it too.
[124:17.84]Yeah.
[124:18.86]And so don't streamers.
[124:40.33]Oh, that hurt my chest.
[124:44.00]Streaming is karate.

[132:57.16]What?
[132:58.00]What?
[132:58.64]Why is the door locked behind me?
[133:01.24]Why would the door lock behind me?
[133:04.48]Are you kidding me?
[133:05.28]Oh my god.
[133:18.64]Oh, for the love of fucking God, I have to do this whole thing again.
[133:22.42]I just have to... Okay.
[133:50.49]Make sure to lock the door behind you from the inside, Mario.
[133:54.85]From the inside.
[133:55.71]Yeah.
[133:57.77]Good.
[134:02.28]How do we trust you with all this bullshit?
[134:13.64]Okay.
[134:23.85]Get out of my way.
[134:32.42]Okay, give me a pineapple.
[134:33.70]Okay, got a pineapple.
[134:35.96]Excuse me, bye.
[134:36.84]Here you go.
[134:52.66]Now Yoshi, make them pay.
[135:04.11]Alright, now I got Yoshi.
[135:05.25]Now we go up.
[135:07.19]We eat the ghost in front of the door.
[135:09.43]I guarantee it.
[135:10.57]If that's not what I have to do... I will...
[135:41.28]Why is this door open?
[135:41.74]Oh, hi there!
[135:42.00]I thought they were ghosts.
[135:44.88]Oh, sorry.
[135:45.08]Oh, yeah, right.
[136:24.10]What are you doing up here?
[136:24.84]All these ghosts are causing us trouble.
[136:26.17]They're everywhere.
[136:27.43]Why can't someone come along and suck them up with a vacuum?
[136:31.03]Why are you looking at me like that?
[136:32.03]Yoshi is so... Just so good.
[136:46.09]What a little... What a little good boy, you know what I mean?
[136:59.94]Oh, I'm gonna get lost up here.
[137:03.26]That's a guarantee.
[137:04.86]He didn't get the coin.
[137:05.62]Come on, guy.
[137:06.32]It's alright.
[137:08.14]Don't- How- What does it take for Yoshi to die?
[137:15.40]Yoshi doesn't just die, right?
[137:20.89]You run out of juice.
[137:24.11]Is that for real?
[137:40.08]What?
[137:41.32]Eat him!
[137:42.46]Okay.
[137:47.02]What the hell am I... Ooh.
[137:57.51]I think everything's clear.
[138:01.36]Can I go in the middle somehow?
[138:04.14]He's dying.
[138:04.66]Oh, he is.
[138:26.49]Of course I get stuck in the door.
[138:27.99]Okay.
[138:30.27]Okay.
[138:35.20]I need another pineapple.
[138:36.34]Wait, it might not be a pineapple.
[138:38.82]Check.
[138:42.73]It is a pineapple.
[138:43.49]Come on.
[138:44.43]I unlocked the pineapple.
[138:45.75]This should be a banana at this point.
[139:04.32]I don't need him anymore?
[139:18.84]I guess I did clear it all.
[139:26.37]What's the goal, though?
[139:27.27]Where am I trying to get to?
[139:28.03]Oh, look at this.
[139:34.21]Hey!
[139:35.13]Remember me?
[139:35.71]Pineapple!
[139:38.45]Eh, what was the point of this?
[139:55.10]Oh.
[139:55.60]Okay.
[139:57.54]I need a Yoshi.
[140:00.14]Please!
[140:00.58]Don't!
[140:00.96]Is that still there?
[140:02.64]Don't disappear.
[140:03.20]It doesn't disappear, right?
[140:04.02]Fruit doesn't disappear.
[140:04.71]It stays.
[140:12.87]Come here.
[140:16.31]Let's go.
[140:16.72]Alright.
[140:17.24]Eat a bunch of fruit.
[140:18.32]Let's move.
[140:18.80]How come Yoshi doesn't die in that water?
[140:24.88]What's up with that?
[140:34.58]It's too shallow.
[140:35.67]If you step into an inch of water with Yoshi on the beach, he dies.
[140:40.73]Is he a slug?
[140:41.37]I don't understand.
[140:42.19]Salt water?
[140:58.16]I'm back.
[140:59.50]And I'm ready to kill you.
[141:00.40]Okay.
[141:13.31]So... We got a... The blue sofa looks suspicious.
[141:20.69]Doesn't it?
[141:21.87]Nintendo.
[141:46.29]What's the point of any of this?
[141:49.16]Go out the door?
[141:52.14]Is there a crack that I'm missing?
[141:57.78]I don't think so.
[142:04.86]What about the walls?
[142:06.82]Anything on the walls?
[142:07.52]Oh.
[142:09.15]That's it.
[142:09.55]Huh.
[142:15.21]Okay.
[142:15.71]Well, can I go back up?
[142:19.39]Should we just leave?
[142:24.07]Let's go to the door.
[142:24.85]Can't open?
[142:26.69]Okay.
[142:27.25]Uh, we need to go back up.
[142:44.31]There's another, I think there's another tile thing.
[142:50.84]Get in there.
[142:55.74]I don't know how that's possible to fall.
[143:08.34]Like, I'm gonna buy a lottery ticket tonight.
[143:37.11]is over there is there a crack tile over there yep
[143:43.29]I'm seeing quite a few PogChamps in the chat, but I need to correct you.
[143:47.45]I'm gonna quell this, because I should.
[143:49.83]In the time it took me just to do that, I could have walked around the whole level two or three times.
[144:04.44]Take that.
[144:07.34]Hey, have you lost your mind?
[144:08.32]You can't just barge into a lady's room.
[144:10.38]It's just not done.
[144:11.80]Get out.
[144:12.28]Shoo, shoo!
[144:16.80]What's that?
[144:18.82]Anything in here?
[144:19.52]Paintings?
[144:21.40]Yup.
[144:21.72]Anything else?
[144:29.68]Do you want me to leave, lady?
[144:36.70]Are you sure you didn't want me to exorcist puke around your whole hotel room?
[144:42.05]Oh.
[144:42.53]Sorry.
[144:58.16]What's this charge of $750?
[144:59.80]Well, there was exorcist puke all over your room, ma'am.
[145:05.74]You don't understand, I didn't do that!
[145:10.38]A strange little man with a mustache thrown in on a dinosaur!
[145:14.40]And he puked all over the place!
[145:16.04]Okay, lady.
[145:17.26]Just pay the fucking deposit, please.
[145:20.65]No, I'm not crazy, it happened!
[145:27.19]Where did we go from here?
[145:28.23]Am I missing something?
[145:37.69]Wait, up here?
[145:38.62]No.
[145:40.62]I'm back.
[145:49.64]Was there nothing down there?
[145:50.78]There has to be something down there.
[145:53.48]What would the point be of coming down here?
[146:00.55]Oh.
[146:01.95]Just don't... Just a blue coin?
[146:05.61]Fuck.
[146:06.33]Alright, is there another tile that I didn't do?
[146:15.18]Ah, over there.
[146:31.86]Fruit fly brain fruit flies are for their size the electrons and neutrons in their brains are actually a thousand times their body weight, so If I'm a scaled up fruit fly then see that's a mistake on your part Wait just ended up back down here
[147:10.58]Okay.
[147:12.43]Did I go there?
[147:13.93]Is there one over there?
[147:20.92]There is.
[147:21.36]Wait, yeah.
[147:36.96]If I was a scaled-up fruit fly, you guys, I would be able to control shit with my brain and be able to move objects with my thoughts.
[147:44.92]You think I'm that intelligent?
[147:46.56]You're flattering me, but thank you.
[147:49.20]I got it.
[148:03.79]You're giving flies way too much credit.
[148:15.25]Why does it still want me to go that way?
[148:26.05]I'm going in there.
[148:27.43]It so badly wants me to be over there.
[148:34.18]Haven't I done almost everything here?
[148:37.28]Six.
[148:37.74]The shell's secret.
[148:41.82]I see flies move stuff with their brain all the time.
[148:44.10]Alright, we gotta get in the shell.
[148:53.08]Oh, yes!
[148:54.20]Oh, yes!
[148:54.86]I don't need to listen to that.
[148:57.00]I know what to do.

[170:15.14]Ouchies!
[170:15.96]Look out!
[170:16.30]He's jumping!
[170:19.42]Like Rube Goldberg machine Mario levels.
[170:21.82]I mean, I'm not into him at the moment.
[170:23.52]Where did he go?
[170:24.53]Is he up?
[170:49.57]I don't know, man.
[170:50.01]You're the expert.
[170:51.39]Come on.
[170:58.37]This is a telltale game.
[171:02.75]What is this image?
[171:05.03]Okay, that is just a screen grab of me going like this.
[171:12.21]That's what...
[171:54.78]It's still the worst joke.
[171:57.22]Yeah, I know.
[171:59.26]I know.
[172:00.86]I'm completely and totally aware of it.
[172:03.16]I know it's the worst.
[172:08.09]Trust me when I say, I'm very... Ooh, we have a Yoshi.
[172:16.00]Where's Pineapple?

[173:11.23]Anybody got a pineapple around here?
[173:20.97]Who's got a pineapple?
[173:22.33]I need one.
[173:23.15]Very, very, very, very badly.
[173:31.77]Put it back on.

[174:43.40]This place.
[175:08.99]I don't know.
[175:09.43]I can't hear any of these.
[175:10.23]I can just see that they're titled.
[175:13.87]The Runaway Ferris Wheel.
[175:28.91]Jeremy, stop.
[175:30.03]It went to a political podcast.
[175:46.21]This thing's going too fast!
[175:49.29]It's going way too fast.
[175:53.73]This is too fast.
[176:00.51]Why are these... This is called bad joke?
[176:04.73]Bad joke!
[176:16.45]It knows.
[176:17.75]It knows.
[176:18.91]It's self-aware.
[176:23.31]I just can see the titles.
[176:24.51]I don't even know what's playing.
[176:35.46]We're gonna get so many of these.
[176:37.32]What just... I just... Water just hit me in the mouth.
[176:39.37]How?
[176:41.23]I just spit in the air.
[176:43.21]I spit in the fucking air and it landed back in my mouth.
[176:46.59]That's what happened.
[176:48.65]Dude, that just happened.
[176:51.51]There's no water in Las Vegas.
[177:08.17]Missed one.
[177:19.21]Alright, we're gonna get up to the teacups or whatever the hell it is.
[177:22.87]There we go.
[177:24.43]Alright, up to the teacups.
[177:36.84]Oh, pineapple!
[177:38.32]Alright, that's... This is where the pineapple is.
[177:40.23]Remember that.
[177:42.11]Remember where the pineapple is.
[177:48.75]Dude, we're getting fucked up here.

[178:02.79]Where are the teacups?
[178:03.65]Where are the teacups?
[178:07.97]I don't know.
[178:25.23]That one was intentional.
[178:26.33]I got that one.
[178:27.87]I got that one in the bag.
[178:29.19]I got that one in the bag.
[178:30.31]Alright, what do I do?
[178:31.05]How do I stop this?
[178:36.78]How do I stop this?
[178:37.70]Oh, there's a guy down there.
[178:46.32]Oh, no one can ride the first wheel.
[178:47.47]This is so lame.
[178:50.07]When is it going to be fixed?
[178:55.37]As you can see, it just spins and spins and spins.
[178:57.33]Sorry, but this ride is not working well at the moment.

[195:31.52]There has to be a cool down period.
[195:44.72]Wait, what the fuck?

[195:51.93]I'm...
[195:57.76]Keys, keys, keys.
[195:58.86]No, I can't.
[195:59.90]Let me get to another star first.

[196:15.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[196:33.65]Now I gotta go this way.
[196:42.66]I gotta go the other side now and knock him off.
[196:51.24]What was that sound?
[196:52.14]I don't know.
[196:52.50]I wasn't paying 100% attention.
[196:59.73]I gotta go around and kill the other guy.
[197:06.83]Was it Trey Parker?
[197:07.87]It might have been.
[197:08.43]It was the South Park.
[197:11.55]Holy shit.
[197:12.89]Am I stuck?
[197:14.99]How can I not move?
[197:21.98]What?
[197:22.26]What?
[197:50.27]You're gonna drop viewers.
[197:52.15]It's okay.
[197:53.09]It's alright.
[197:54.01]It's okay.
[197:54.79]Oh man.

[197:59.14]God damn it.
[198:00.82]I gotta... Alright, don't fall.
[198:20.12]I killed two of them.
[198:22.98]I have enough room to go this way.
[198:24.26]And then why did I get stuck on the other one?
[198:31.03]So now if I go like this... They come up.
[198:35.47]I go up.
[198:38.19]Nope.
[198:38.59]I go like this.
[198:40.99]Which then puts me around this way, right?
[198:45.43]Nickelodeon.
[198:47.09]Nickelodeon, not Nintendo.
[198:49.39]No.
[198:53.60]Nintendo, what the fuck?

[199:35.34]I just... I'm just gonna jump it.
[199:36.66]Okay.
[199:39.56]No, I'm not.
[199:40.04]I don't think I can.
[199:50.48]I just gotta go- I just have to- Alright, this is his plan.
[199:56.30]There.
[200:04.24]And then it's- is it- it's A, right?
[200:05.92]I press A, not B?
[200:07.42]A, right?
[200:08.14]It's A?
[200:09.00]A. A?
[200:10.72]A.
[200:24.44]Oh my god, my fucking stomach.
[200:28.08]Hooray!
[200:29.06]Alright, where... Now what?
[200:50.67]Is it on top of me?
[200:51.49]Where is it?
[200:51.99]I don't want to die.
[200:54.13]Don't die.
[200:54.65]Shit, I wasn't even looking.
[200:58.55]What is this?
[201:25.69]It's kind of far away.
[201:27.09]Uh, fuck it.
[201:33.59]I just need to get out of here.
[201:34.33]I gotta ride the, uh, roller coaster?
[201:36.07]Alright, ride it.
[201:37.87]Oh, I'm gonna die from this one!
[201:53.88]Oh, man!
[201:55.56]I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!
[201:58.04]I'm fine.
[202:18.07]See look you can get on now.
[202:19.67]No one can ride-
[202:20.87]Yes they can.
[202:23.68]Just jump from here.
[202:25.14]I know it seems so- I'm so panicky because I have two hearts.
[202:28.74]And I laughed out, like, 500 packs of cigarettes.
[202:32.63]Like, I've smoked 500 packs of cigarettes.
[202:54.06]I'm going to get coins.
[203:13.53]How could this be a Super Mario level and there's no coins anywhere?
[203:16.37]Where are the coins?
[203:17.91]There's no coins anywhere!
[203:28.03]Not a single coin!
[203:35.15]You, come here.
[203:36.91]Probably have one.
[203:45.36]You got him three hours ago.
[203:46.70]Can I jump on this guy's head?
[204:01.44]Give me a coin.
[204:07.13]Oh my, you've got to be kidding me.
[204:17.51]None of you have a coin.
[204:23.37]The big one will have, like, three.
[204:25.03]Has to be, right?
[204:30.86]Well, it's a big... Alright, that's good enough.
[204:36.86]Okay, now we don't have to hear the alarm sound anymore.
[204:43.53]Alright.
[204:43.91]I have to climb this again, don't I?
[204:50.63]First of all.
[204:54.63]Oh, I don't have to do this?
[205:06.49]What's the best way?
[205:07.07]Just to do where I was before?
[205:08.53]Or just go into one that's open?
[205:18.23]Just climb in.
[205:19.13]Just jump into an open one.
[205:20.37]Oh, okay.
[205:32.83]So... Which one of these... How many...
[205:37.42]I feel like this is gonna be really hard to do this
[206:07.39]I'm trying to get on top, but when I press right trigger, the camera is lost 45% of the time.
[206:33.32]The worst enemy in Mario Sunshine.
[206:36.28]Fucking Nickelodeon.
[206:44.84]Get on top so you can jump down.
[206:46.10]That's where I was going!
[206:47.12]Everybody said, don't go that way!
[206:48.56]I was getting screamed at!
[206:51.02]I was going the other way!
[206:52.02]I was gonna climb up!
[206:53.38]Alright, that... I'm just going the other way.
[207:05.43]How the fuck did that happen?
[207:06.33]I don't understand.
[207:22.55]I-I-I can't- you can't wall jump from there!
[207:24.58]It don't work!
[207:54.27]Okay.
[207:58.05]Get me the fuck up here, for the love of God.
[208:09.09]You fucker.
[208:11.77]Alright.
[208:20.53]Shut your car door?
[208:21.71]Just hold on a second.
[208:27.10]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing it like this.
[208:40.71]Salvaged.
[208:57.86]Take your keys out of the ignition.
[209:04.19]Put your damn seatbelt on.
[209:05.33]Don't drive around without a seatbelt.
[209:06.41]What, are you fucking nuts?
[209:17.38]And... Again!
[209:38.40]The Yoshi Go Round secret.
[209:41.34]Uh... What's the Yoshi Go Round?
[209:48.83]The entrance is, uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[209:58.09]Keys, keys, keys!
[209:59.21]No, no, no, no, no!
[210:16.52]Alright, so what's- where's the secret?
[210:24.29]Do you know where it is?
[210:25.73]Look at that, only the orange Yoshi on the ride disappeared.
[210:28.82]What does it mean, mister?
[210:34.36]Well, that would mean I probably need to come over here with an orange Yoshi.
[210:38.72]Hmm.
[210:44.90]Cool.
[210:49.57]But where is any Yoshi?
[211:05.13]Wrong, idiot, wrong, idiot, wrong, idiot.
[211:14.57]Whoa, that was a blue coin.
[211:22.83]Quick.
[211:24.54]Wrong.
[211:25.22]Lie.
[211:25.94]You lied to me.
[211:26.65]Why could you not like it?
[211:37.24]It's got coins!
[211:39.68]Alright, got it.
[211:50.58]I just heard, um, Daffy, Laffy from Gremlins 2.
[211:55.32]I need, where's a Yoshi?
[212:12.01]I need a pineapple.
[212:13.01]I know where the pineapple is, but where's the Yoshi egg?
[212:21.66]Where did I see a Yoshiaga here?
[212:23.50]Somewhere.
[212:30.08]Is it at the very beginning?
[212:31.38]Is it?
[212:31.58]At least I killed that guy.
[212:39.74]Got him both.
[212:44.35]No, it's definitely... No, I can't go back.
[212:50.96]He's redeemed
[213:23.23]Shit, that's a banana.
[213:31.14]Chat is actually the baby now.
[213:32.84]They want the keys.
[213:33.92]I told you!
[213:38.51]There it is.
[213:42.01]What do you want?
[213:43.49]You want a... Alright, a pear.
[213:45.99]I think I saw one of those over here.
[213:50.80]Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys!
[213:53.70]Give us keys!
[213:55.46]Right now!
[214:00.06]Nope.
[214:07.38]You're not getting the keys.
[214:10.10]No keys, you're not getting them.
[214:14.32]Now I have to run around like a dickhead and look for this one fruit on this whole map.
[214:37.94]What's in here?
[214:38.97]In this pool or something?
[214:40.61]No, that's a banana.
[214:48.73]That's in a really weird place.
[214:50.48]I thought I would not have... Come here.
[215:00.46]We gotta make you orange.
[215:01.44]You are orange already!
[215:02.45]Let's go!
[215:19.90]He didn't die from the other water that was shallow?
[215:22.88]What the f- Now I know what that is.
[215:30.99]So, if it's all water, why can't he stand in the pools?
[215:33.35]What do you mean that's not shallow?
[215:35.91]It goes up to my fucking knees as Mario and he's like three and a half feet tall.
[215:45.80]Where's this fruit?
[215:46.46]It was like on this tree.
[215:47.56]Okay.
[216:13.08]You fucking little gremlin.
[216:15.52]You are taller than me and you can't stand in that water.
[216:20.99]I don't- Are you just- Are you going in head first and holding your head underwater?
[216:28.13]That is pink.
[216:29.29]This is great.
[216:34.54]How do I- I gotta- Eat that.
[216:38.94]Alright, you're now orange.
[216:40.84]Now please!
[216:42.84]Don't go over there!
[216:43.34]Don't go over there!
[216:43.88]Watch out!
[216:44.30]There's... There's some deep water, Yoshi!
[216:46.74]Don't go over there!
[217:04.51]He's made out of cotton candy.
[217:27.23]Does it matter?
[217:27.71]Does it matter which one I start on?
[217:33.12]Does it?
[217:33.58]Probably not.
[217:35.84]This is Frogger.
[217:37.08]Is it Frogger?
[217:38.17]It is Frogger, isn't it?
[217:49.74]um wait okay holy shit I didn't mean to do that the camera just fucked me up okay
[218:22.84]Oh, it moves.
[218:25.96]I know what to do.
[218:31.46]Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[218:34.30]I can't fucking believe it.
[218:39.14]I can't believe it.
[218:40.22]I knew exactly what it was.
[218:41.74]Why did I even do that?
[218:42.62]I just freaked the fuck out for no reason.
[218:45.16]There was no reason.
[218:46.34]I'll never do these.
[218:47.48]I'm never gonna be able to do any of these.
[218:59.42]Fucking depth perception.
[219:01.44]Just keep the camera here at all times.
[219:03.10]Don't ever move it.
[219:05.02]There's no reason to ever move the camera from here.
[219:06.66]Like fucking Diablo.
[219:11.69]I'm in trouble.
[219:13.73]Oh my- no, no, no.
[219:18.19]I had it beat to- fuck this.
[219:25.62]Thank you.
[220:06.42]Climb it!
[220:07.16]Okay, I'm pressing the up button, you fucker.
[220:09.76]That was the wrong thing to jump on!
[220:15.22]Can I compensate this?
[220:17.90]Okay, we're good.
[220:18.52]We're okay, right?
[220:20.38]We're okay.
[220:21.56]We're fine.
[220:22.90]Just don't move.
[220:24.50]What do I do?
[220:25.84]We're good.
[220:30.60]This is the one.
[220:31.06]No, it's not.
[220:33.34]It's this one.
[220:48.22]but this time don't be a fucking idiot.
[221:45.66]Do it right.
[221:46.32]Do it right.
[221:47.10]No, no, don't jump over there.
[221:49.54]Do it right.
[221:50.72]Do it right.
[222:06.83]We're okay.
[222:07.49]We're okay.
[222:08.19]Everything's okay.
[222:09.43]We're okay.
[222:19.28]Everything's fine.
[222:19.76]We're okay.
[222:20.18]We're gonna be fine.
[222:48.84]You don't have to rush!
[222:50.60]You don't have to go that fast, man!
[222:54.44]I'm so incapable!
[222:55.66]You don't have to go that fast!
[222:58.48]I'm just like, I gotta go as fast as I can!
[223:00.56]I'm so bad at fucking video games, Mario especially.
[223:05.67]My patience is out of a fucking goddamn weasel, you know what I mean?
[223:09.35]I'm trying to steal your regs.
[223:14.59]And even if there's like 40 spiders in there, I'm just going to steal eggs, I idiot!
[223:39.49]Why?
[223:39.77]Why?
[223:40.05]Why?
[223:41.15]Guys, um, I fell!
[223:42.93]I didn't fall!
[223:44.95]Okay.
[223:46.47]So I don't understand what the fuck I'm doing.
[223:48.91]Oh, I know what it was.
[223:50.15]Sorry.
[223:50.65]Sometimes I forget.
[223:52.15]People holding their foot down on the gas until it hits the bottom of their car and flying by at 90 miles per hour.
[224:00.58]It's a little distracting.
[224:02.44]Sometimes I forget.
[224:03.26]Sorry.
[224:07.80]Like pushing your gas down until you hit the bottom of the car.
[224:13.06]Cool.
[224:15.03]Safe!
[224:31.39]I did this the first time and now I'm so anxious I can't fucking do it again!
[224:46.12]Every time.
[224:46.66]How am I doing that so wrong?
[224:52.13]It's got to be a side flip.
[224:53.16]I didn't do a side flip the first time I did it.
[225:17.33]See?
[225:18.55]Okay.
[225:20.03]You fucking weirdo.
[225:21.31]It's time for you to stop being such a weirdo and do this!
[225:29.76]You fucking weirdo.
[225:36.00]Oh my god, why?
[225:41.21]So misleading.
[225:46.86]Long jump?
[225:47.38]That doesn't exist in Mario Sunshine.
[225:48.88]They deleted it from the game.
[226:12.30]Shit your diaper, hurry up.
[226:15.24]Press the blue button to leap?
[226:17.58]What?
[226:19.84]That's not true.
[226:21.10]Is that a lie?
[226:23.03]Wait, is that a lie?
[226:23.93]That's not a lie.
[226:24.93]Z?
[226:25.19]That's not Z, is it?
[226:29.05]No, it's not.
[226:34.95]No, you gotta just go right at the top.
[226:37.69]I gotta count.
[226:38.65]Here we go.
[226:38.91]I'm gonna count.
[226:40.35]Ready?
[226:42.48]One.
[226:42.92]One.
[226:43.78]Two.
[226:44.82]Three.
[226:45.54]It takes like three full seconds to get to the top.
[226:47.49]Here we go.
[226:48.19]Fucking weirdo.
[227:20.83]Don't worry, that wasn't embarrassing, Jeremy.
[227:25.07]It's okay.
[227:27.35]I had a diaper full of slime, like, three months ago.
[227:30.95]It's alright.
[227:32.13]I think I'll be fine.
[227:42.58]Five months, whatever it was.
[227:49.61]Shadow Mario in the park.
[227:50.98]This one's kind of just for free, isn't it?
[228:12.94]Here he comes.
[228:15.12]Have you ever grown a beard?
[228:15.90]I physically can't do it.
[228:19.88]I don't have enough hair.
[228:23.12]If that makes any sense.
[228:23.88]I don't have enough hair.
[228:26.80]It grows out like straw.
[228:55.46]darn it I'll remember this oh no I it I can kind of grow but it's blonde so like here look I'll show you so for instance
[229:16.85]It's all the black.
[229:18.13]There's tons of blonde hair in here that you can't really see.
[229:20.70]It looks weird because there's a ton of blonde hair in there.
[229:32.13]It's like black and blonde.
[229:49.13]That is weird.
[229:49.69]It is weird.
[229:52.15]And even if I do grow this out, it looks like... It just- it doesn't look- it's not- you don't want it.
[230:01.39]Like, I don't want it on my face.
[230:03.01]I like having a little bit.
[230:05.21]Maybe after a few days of shaving, I think it looks okay.
[230:08.56]But once you go four, five, six days after shaving, I look like- I look like a fucking mutant or something.
[230:14.60]I look horrible.
[230:19.91]Okay.
[230:21.21]What?
[230:21.81]What's left?
[230:23.29]What's left in this video game?
[230:26.39]Only three at Siena, uh, Serena Beach.
[230:33.78]Three.
[230:35.38]Eight.
[230:36.60]Five.
[230:39.18]Two at Pianta Village.
[230:41.26]Oh yeah, that one sucks.
[230:43.54]What about the airstrip?
[230:45.14]Holy f- Wait, I've only gotten one from the airstrip?
[230:48.03]Only one s- Really?
[230:50.77]Is there only one there?
[230:51.63]There's only one.
[230:57.57]Oh, okay.
[230:57.97]I was going to say, holy shit, that's kind of bad.
[231:00.21]I'm going to go to the beach.
[231:01.80]This one.
[231:02.10]This is the one with the house, right?
[231:09.48]Or I could go to the harbor.
[231:10.22]Yeah, I'm going to go to Rico Harbor.
[231:11.62]There's two or three there that I can get.
[231:16.67]Well, I haven't been there in a long time.
[231:17.75]I don't remember where the hell it is.
[231:27.46]Is this one right here?
[231:31.82]Is this it right here?
[231:32.41]Is that it?
[231:36.07]Is that it?
[231:37.41]No?
[231:38.81]Which one is it?
[231:39.24]This one?
[231:40.28]Over here?
[231:53.94]Where does that coin pop up?
[231:55.30]Oh, okay.
[231:56.62]I have 54 coins.
[231:59.18]Where do I spend these?
[232:11.15]In the hut.
[232:19.12]I hear a star.
[232:21.56]Why do I hear a star?
[232:25.91]Oh shit, okay, here I can get this.
[232:26.91]Oh, I already got it, right.
[232:33.35]I got fifty-five of these things.
[232:48.15]Alright.
[232:48.41]I have to go to the hut.
[232:53.55]Uh, like the marketplace?
[232:55.03]Is there somebody at the market or something?
[233:02.16]Boathouse?
[233:05.00]Across from the cannon.
[233:06.27]Across from the cannon.
[233:10.99]Across from the cannon.
[233:20.06]down here.
[233:20.46]Like over there.
[233:21.86]Over here.
[233:23.42]Wait, in front of me.
[233:24.26]In front, like what?
[233:27.82]Like right in front of me.
[233:31.15]Literally, like literally right in front of me.
[233:32.99]Turn around.
[233:35.27]Like right here?
[233:37.89]Like this guy?
[233:41.81]Wrong.
[233:42.27]This is the spot with the M.
[233:55.32]Behind you.
[233:56.20]Am I getting fucked with right now?
[233:58.30]There's people trying to tell me where to go and then people telling me the wrong way, right?
[234:02.50]Look to the left.
[234:07.47]There's so much information flooding the chat right now.
[234:11.57]Rico Harbor Building.
[234:13.17]No, it's on the pier.
[234:17.25]Right here.
[234:20.80]You can go in this building?
[234:28.71]Oh, okay.
[234:32.37]It's up my ass and around the corner.
[234:33.81]See, when people say shit like that, and that's like what I see, and then I see left, remember, there's a stream delay where you're getting what I do five to eight seconds after I do it.
[234:45.82]So when I turn left to look left, and you say left, I did that five and a half, six seconds ago, and then by the time you say it's right in front of you, I'm actually looking at where the boat was because five seconds have to go by.
[234:59.35]Wait, ten blue coins?
[235:02.59]I just got five shines.
[235:04.33]Why have I been hoarding these?
[235:07.78]Yeah, let's go.
[235:10.64]No refunds.
[235:11.26]Wait, should I not do this?
[235:15.26]It's two seconds.
[235:15.88]You ready?
[235:17.42]I wonder if I'm going to say one right now.
[235:24.54]Six seconds.
[235:27.96]That was six seconds before I saw one in chat.
[235:29.95]Ready?
[235:30.11]Let's do it again.
[235:30.79]On camera.
[235:31.71]So, ready?
[235:32.97]I want you to say... I'm going to say a word, and you have to say it the second you see my mouth moving.
[235:40.14]Point!
[235:45.56]Six seconds.
[235:46.04]That was 5.8 seconds.
[236:02.65]Time it on stream.
[236:03.51]How would I do that?
[236:06.79]47 stars.
[236:18.64]Congratulations, they do nothing?
[236:20.72]Wait, really?
[236:22.90]Pull up a clock?
[236:23.94]How is that going to do anything?
[236:26.68]Because whatever you see, I could have a clock that's counting down, and you would get the countdown five seconds after I start the countdown.
[236:42.59]Put chat on screen.
[236:43.61]I mean, I can't... That's a pain in the... I don't want to... I'm busy.
[236:56.55]Red Coins in the Water at Rico Harbor.
[237:03.37]Alright, I rage quit this one.
[237:05.01]I'm back.
[237:17.00]I have to get perfect timing here.
[237:22.44]Ready?
[237:23.16]Nope!
[237:31.60]All I care about is the red ones.
[237:32.94]Okay, we're good?
[237:34.66]Fuck, it's okay.
[237:35.42]Come back around and get it.
[237:50.35]Holy shit, this thing is hard to control.
[237:55.75]I got time, but... Damn, this is...
[237:59.34]Okay, this is hard.
[238:00.30]This is very hard to control.
[238:17.51]Use the middle squid?
[238:19.15]Wait, I thought I was getting... I wasn't getting lied to yesterday.
[238:27.17]So people actually, you really were going faster or slower?
[238:30.41]Holy fuck, I thought everyone was just making that up.
[238:39.20]I thought people were just making that up.
[238:42.16]You see, I could never tell.
[238:43.16]I could never tell.
[238:44.12]Who knows?
[238:44.72]Who knows what's accurate and what's inaccurate?
[238:46.82]I don't know.
[238:47.22]I could be... You guys could be just messing with me.
[239:35.31]Okay, we're... Holy shit, how am I still alive?
[239:44.41]Mario, Mario, fix the camera, Mario.
[239:47.47]Mario, this is a great music video you're making, but I would appreciate if I could get a better view of the game.
[240:10.78]Shit.
[240:11.54]Oh, well.
[240:18.30]I guarantee you will not finish this level.
[240:20.45]Oh, yeah?
[240:21.35]Guffrey1337?
[240:21.81]Write that name down.
[240:23.77]They're getting this up.
[240:25.95]Like, in a few months, if I feel like it.
[240:47.73]Guaranteed.
[241:10.05]Just follow the yellow brick road.
[241:23.25]Where's... Six?
[241:33.52]There's one in the air somewhere.
[241:34.62]Where is it?
[241:34.90]It's right there.
[241:36.50]There's one in the air right here.
[241:38.93]I got a minute.
[241:39.53]I have a full minute, guys.
[241:40.61]It'll be alright.
[241:45.72]I swear to, okay, it's almost like, it's almost like this, like an evil part of my brain that magnetizes me to do stupid things.
[241:53.37]Like, I, it's like hubris, you know what I mean?
[241:55.63]It's like I'm magnetized to screw something up because I just told you that I was doing fine.
[242:09.90]Evil shadow.
[242:14.45]Audio is desynced, huh?
[242:25.06]Like, I just need to stop talking about how things I'm doing are going well.
[242:38.25]Like, when I'm cooking.
[242:39.93]Oh, this hamburger sure does look like it's medium rare.
[242:43.20]Medium well.
[242:44.16]Why is there a fire here now?
[242:48.00]Wait, I burnt it.
[242:48.76]I burnt it.
[242:49.18]What's that smell?
[242:49.72]It stinks.
[242:50.10]It smells like smoke.
[242:52.70]Oh, shit.
[242:56.59]Okay, I gotta get off at this exit.
[242:58.27]Yeah, this one right here.
[243:00.17]Why am I not going off on the exit?
[243:03.29]No, slow down.
[243:03.73]I gotta slow down!
[243:18.85]How is that even possible?
[243:27.66]I could probably do open-heart surgery on myself if I just didn't say that I'm... Yeah, this is going pretty well!
[244:10.93]Oh my god, it's so hard to determine where that fucking coin is.
[244:27.42]Guarantee you won't beat this.
[244:38.75]Mario's made it to Dippin' Dots?
[244:44.18]That'd be, like, kind of cool.
[244:59.39]Is it, like... Let me guess.
[245:00.41]The eighth coin is, like, hidden somewhere in a stupid place.
[245:11.68]Going this way I'm not missing it
[245:45.99]Where's the last point?
[246:23.30]Let him suffer.
[246:24.04]That's so mean.
[246:39.50]This is going too fast.
[246:41.30]This is going too fast.
[246:43.56]Why did I jump on the pink one?
[246:46.84]Get over here!
[246:59.07]Alright, we're good.
[247:03.05]Sound is out of sync.
[247:03.85]Is it?
[247:04.21]Ready?
[247:05.43]How am I?
[247:12.42]The audio's ahead.

[248:42.52]Thanks for waiting.
[248:57.94]You're a hell of a guy.
[248:59.46]Oh, what was the person that guaranteed I wasn't going to beat that level?
[249:24.87]You owe me $100, right?
[249:34.65]It's always on for talk.
[249:36.94]Every time.
[249:48.02]Not this time.
[249:48.70]Not this time, you little shit.
[249:58.69]Percy.

[252:06.97]You know what I mean?
[252:07.61]Like, you know, every, like, every eight minutes, like, six of you just write it in all caps, and I, you know, it's probably, you know, it's probably, at this point, gonna, it's gonna happen.
[252:16.10]Keep, keep doing it.
[252:16.92]It'll keep, yeah, I'm sure it will.
[252:20.00]Eventually, it has to, right?
[252:21.10]I mean, you're saying it every, every stream, like, a hundred times.
[252:24.88]It's gonna, it has to still, it's gonna happen.
[252:27.02]Just keep doing it.

[273:54.92]I don't understand, throw another one at him?
[273:58.80]Throw more fruit at him, I guess?
[274:13.83]Well, how would it change if I throw a fruit at him and he goes, oh, that doesn't affect him.
[274:18.71]But when he eats hot peppers all of a sudden, now it hurts him.
[274:27.74]What?
[274:35.61]Kill these guys.
[274:43.77]Are you waiting for them to die?
[274:54.53]Fruits.

[274:56.37]But what's the point?
[274:57.09]Do I even need to stomp this shit?
[274:58.65]It's just kind of annoying.
[274:59.45]What's the point of stomping it?
[275:00.39]Alright, we're gonna go up here, and then we're gonna throw this at him.
[275:08.61]Okay.
[275:12.03]Yes.

[275:41.38]I'm currently stunlocked.
[275:44.30]This is how it ends.
[276:09.34]I need coins.
[276:28.80]Hey, look at that.
[276:30.52]Thanks for the coins!
[276:34.39]Swell, swell, swell.
[276:42.14]He's turning down the audio.
[276:51.12]It's a little loud.
[276:52.91]Alright, he's dead.
[276:55.43]Uh...
[277:16.95]Penis music.
[277:31.58]He said it because I only have one frame of reference for this.
[277:50.24]Okay.
[277:51.94]So that leaves us with... There's more in here.
[277:55.30]What do I got?
[277:57.88]Six?
[278:04.12]Scrubbing Serena Beach.

[278:20.58]Mario, we got trouble.
[278:22.06]That electric goop is back.
[278:23.44]Where?
[278:23.86]Everywhere.
[278:24.36]Oh, by the way, you have three minutes!
[278:32.93]Oh, what?
[279:11.10]Do you have to get everything or just like 80% or something?
[279:25.48]Refill.
[280:10.71]Throw barrels?
[280:58.88]Stop, stop, stop, stop!
[280:59.82]Alright, alright.
[281:12.36]What the hell?

[283:28.54]No, that doesn't work here.
[283:29.62]That doesn't work here.
[283:30.48]That doesn't work here.
[283:42.95]Shadow Mario checks in.
[283:45.79]So Episode 7 is Shadow Mario every time, it seems, right?
[283:57.28]Makes sense, I guess.
[284:01.20]Go get him.
[284:09.77]I'll never believe it.
[284:10.39]Oh, this is going to be an annoying chase, isn't it?
[284:15.63]Get in there.
[284:16.27]Oh, he's gonna be going through weird doors and through ceilings and... Alright, let's go.
[284:20.87]He did that on purpose.
[284:34.51]Oh, wait.
[284:37.81]They are fake.
[284:40.39]Which one's real?
[285:04.49]Why is it not hitting him?
[285:28.44]Who the fuck are you?
[285:29.34]You little... Yeah, I got ya!
[285:40.83]He's gonna die in the Shadow Mario level.
[285:42.81]Nope!
[285:43.81]He's still alive!
[285:45.36]Did anybody else see the other Mario?
[286:04.65]Thought I did.
[286:11.43]Alright.
[286:13.60]I think we have seven in most of these places.
[286:15.52]Seven.
[286:17.78]Seven.
[286:19.40]Seven.
[286:21.14]Nine.
[286:23.10]Seven.
[286:24.52]Eight.
[286:26.42]Two!
[286:28.46]Two!
[286:29.36]And, okay, that's the other pipe.
[286:36.68]So I gotta go... Up.
[286:40.26]It's up there.
[286:40.96]Okay, I need the rocket.
[286:41.84]Give me the rocket.
[286:43.36]Can you throw it up here to me, please?
[286:44.72]Just throw me the rocket.
[286:45.50]Toss it at me.
[286:46.80]I'll catch it.
[286:47.20]I swear to God, I'll catch it.
[286:49.52]No, dude, I don't want to throw your phone that far.
[286:51.44]I'll catch it.
[286:51.92]Just fucking throw it.
[286:53.21]Oh, God.
[286:53.73]Dude, can I just hand it to you?
[286:54.53]I'm just going to walk over to you and hand it to you.
[286:56.05]Just throw it, dude.
[286:56.91]God.
[286:58.13]Okay, here.
[286:58.57]One, two, three.

[286:59.93]What are these guys doing over here?
[287:14.52]He's slacking off you're slacking off What happened to the phone it tumbled down the stairs
[287:41.22]there a case on it no dummy right alright let's go get the oh here we go what the hell is this weird like picnic basket flag is this
[288:29.03]Oh, right.
[288:30.77]I forgot about this.
[288:31.69]I was like, yeah, I'll come back here.
[288:32.99]Fuck this.
[288:35.32]I gotta go under and then up.
[288:37.04]Alright.
[288:48.13]Alright.
[289:07.34]Super Mario!
[289:12.89]New Super Mario!
[289:14.89]Let's go.
[289:28.64]I remember I was like, why is it moving?
[289:30.12]Why is it moving, man?
[289:31.32]What's going on?
[289:31.88]Why is it moving?
[289:33.74]Wait, I was supposed to jump?
[289:34.82]I was supposed to jump?
[289:35.48]Oh, fuck!
[289:36.14]Oh, no!
[289:36.44]I'll come back later.
[289:37.08]Get out of the way.
[289:45.36]Hey.
[289:46.82]Don't look at me.
[289:48.68]Leave me alone.
[289:54.07]Get out of here.
[289:55.41]Stop.
[290:01.82]What the heck?
[290:02.78]I'm gonna come back later.
[290:06.08]Oh dear.
[290:13.43]What the fuck?
[290:14.23]Where am I right now?
[290:22.93]What's the wrong?
[290:23.57]That's the only thing I can do.
[290:32.84]Okay, can I relax and walk on here?
[290:35.41]The goal is up there, right?
[291:04.67]Should I just shimmy and... This feels incorrect.
[291:16.60]Oh, okay.
[291:17.10]That... You went over the fucking banister, Mario.
[291:23.10]This is definitely the wrong place.
[291:36.03]Easy, easy, easy
[292:38.22]DAMMIT!
[292:41.24]Calm down.
[292:46.73]That was a good guy, like... David Ortiz just struck out in the bottom of the ninth inning.
[292:51.97]In game four of the 2004 fuckin' ALCS.
[292:55.49]You know what I mean?
[292:55.91]That was what that was.
[292:56.81]That was what that sound was.
[292:57.89]That was like an old man screaming at the TV mad because there was a strikeout.
[293:19.97]A plus B is a long dive jump.
[293:21.77]And... why?
[293:25.08]Why did I- Why was I never told?
[293:39.09]What?
[293:39.83]It's been like 16, 17 hours in the game.
[293:43.16]Why do I even know this?
[293:50.14]Because it was funnier.
[293:51.44]What do you mean it was funnier?
[293:53.28]What?
[294:04.41]Karma looks big as fuck today.
[294:20.33]Okay, that was fucking stupid.
[294:23.22]It bumped into me.
[294:24.46]I jumped up.
[294:25.10]I didn't press any buttons.
[294:26.41]The thing, when it swayed back to start to fall, bumped me and knocked me off.
[294:54.70]Turn the cam-
[295:23.53]Scalding right now.
[295:36.10]Go to the police station?
[295:42.81]I don't even know what that is.
[295:45.05]Yeah, I can run through the doors.
[295:45.99]Let me do this first.
[295:59.72]It's all going to be okay.
[296:04.60]I only have one health.
[296:06.36]One life, whatever.
[296:07.70]Okay, where am I?
[296:15.93]Um.
[296:16.17]Is it safe?
[296:19.15]Holy shit, it is.
[296:43.19]I tried using the new jump and it didn't work out for me.
[296:47.18]Unfortunately.
[297:06.41]Spin, jump, then dive.
[297:09.18]The problem with me, though, is reliably spinning the analog to, like, do that.
[297:14.68]I could just, I, you know me, I might just walk the fuck off the cliff.
[297:19.18]Wait.
[297:19.46]Okay, uh... Why am I still alive?
[297:38.61]That doesn't save very much time.
[297:42.57]You have to spin jump every time there.
[297:44.11]You can't just regular jump or dive or anything.
[297:47.00]You have to actually spin jump on every mushroom.
[297:55.81]I'm kind of glad that happened because I only have three... I had one, uh... one up, you know what I mean?
[298:29.30]What's the downside of the game over?
[298:30.42]Oh, just having to run all the way back here.
[298:32.16]I'd rather be able just to start over again.
[298:42.29]Alright, uh, same strategy.
[298:44.05]I'm doing that again.
[298:49.97]I didn't have enough momentum that time.
[298:52.22]No, we're not gonna do that strategy again.
[298:53.64]We're gonna just do it the normal way.
[298:55.85]I didn't have enough momentum.
[299:30.61]Alright, here we go these are cool to have on the level like have those on the level they serve a purpose Okay
[300:05.73]Fuck.
[300:10.67]I did it!
[300:11.43]I spin jumped!
[300:14.60]Stop going the wrong way?
[300:19.88]How am I supposed to know what the way- I've never played this game before!
[300:25.64]Are there like five different holes?
[300:33.30]I don't know, how am I supposed to know that?
[300:35.50]These are the only ones I can reliably get to right now.
[300:39.12]There's one over here and one over there.
[300:40.32]Where's the third one?
[301:07.23]This is dangerous, but what is it for?
[301:09.13]Blue coin?
[301:13.40]Can I go?
[301:13.82]I can't jump in there.
[301:14.84]It's right there.
[301:15.72]Can I go that way?
[301:26.82]Let's see if I can go all the way around.
[301:30.36]All the way.
[301:40.93]Oh, there's one back here.
[301:42.09]This is a hole.
[301:48.37]Right?
[301:48.75]Like, it... It's not a hole?
[301:51.82]This looks like a hole to me.
[301:58.06]No.
[301:58.62]Oh, there it is.
[301:59.16]I can also go back here.
[302:14.19]Well, I'll try this one.
[302:18.46]Where does this bring me?
[302:31.23]Please leave me alone.
[302:37.59]You two are fucking with me right now.
[302:38.91]Just look some other way.
[302:56.04]And then... Oh, Jesus.
[303:00.44]What the fuck?
[303:18.57]Where's he going?
[303:28.29]Holy shit, he's right behind me!
[303:35.83]Okay, now... What do I do?
[303:45.24]I just have to walk.
[303:46.84]The wind shit is going to be over here, isn't it?
[303:49.96]I didn't know there was going to be a springboard!
[303:51.54]Do you see how fucking much I jumped off that?
[303:54.51]That was like a boing!
[304:06.58]I don't care about that.
[304:13.47]I can just make this as a jump, right?
[304:15.69]Of course I can.
[304:18.61]Is this a spring?
[304:34.89]Is this a spring?
[304:59.45]God.
[304:59.95]Oh, man.
[305:00.73]This is... No, no.
[305:06.91]Is this not... Is that not... This is not a tight rope?
[305:16.04]Oh, why can I... Okay.
[305:17.56]Thank you.
[305:17.92]No.
[305:20.92]No.
[305:21.74]No.
[305:22.40]The camera.
[305:23.74]The fucking camera, man.
[305:25.95]The camera.
[305:28.07]Oh, I...
[305:39.55]This place sucks.
[305:44.85]I'm trying to like point dive.
[306:01.61]No, I don't want to do that again.
[306:03.33]I had to juke like four people.
[306:07.95]Do the speedrun skip?
[306:09.25]I'm going for it.
[306:10.13]I'm gonna go for that because that's the only way I ever reliably know my brain will try to do this.
[306:14.41]I'm going for the speedrun strategy.
[306:15.73]You ready?
[306:17.47]Check this shit out.
[306:33.32]this way I'm going for it I'm getting up there I ain't going the real fucked up way no way
[307:10.41]I'm going for it.
[307:11.03]I'm going to get this shit.
[307:14.41]Check this out.
[307:17.51]He'll be reading about me in fucking newspapers after this one.
[307:25.06]He went over the edge.
[307:26.06]Oh my... He decided to parkour over the edge instead of just getting...
[307:37.85]I'm gonna be able to do it that way.
[307:40.09]But he just sometimes decides that he's going to jump over and across instead of just grab.
[307:46.24]He just sometimes is like, Mario's like, you know, I feel like pole vaulting over whatever thing is in front of me.
[307:50.94]I'm just gonna jump the fuck over it.
[308:18.27]Yeah, you'll be worried about me.
[308:43.01]I will say, though, they were so scared to have this game be just the cleaning game.
[308:50.49]They were like, oh my god, no, we have to get rid of that thing and they have to do shit like this for, like, at least 20 levels.
[309:57.23]Open up your fucking books and get to video game history, streamers.
[310:02.60]I want you to open up a fucking book and I want you to see next to Jerma985.
[310:05.68]I want you to look at accomplishments.
[310:08.54]And I'd like you to fucking open up this page.
[310:30.60]You want us to laugh at the no achievements that are in there?
[310:33.76]There's like two.
[310:34.96]Alright, get up.
[310:47.53]What's this guy's problem?
[310:56.59]What was the goal with this level?
[311:00.92]Just to get this?
[311:01.68]Is that it?
[311:03.00]There it is.
[311:21.43]Now, anytime you watch a streamer play this game, and they get to this part, and they go, holy shit, um, this is, I hate this.
[311:26.84]Tell them to use the fucking Germa985 dive technique, and they, show them a YouTube video, show them a clip of this.
[311:34.48]And they'll be like, wow, okay, that's so much easier.
[311:55.61]Now who am I kidding?
[311:56.19]You're gonna link him to slap five times.
[311:57.73]Alright, what's next?
[312:15.85]Chain chomps in the bath.
[312:25.06]Give him a bath?
[312:27.10]Oh, we're gonna have to coach him into the bath?
[312:37.65]Alright, so where's the bath?
[312:41.94]Hey, you've got another problem over here.
[312:43.74]This thing's bigger than all those pups put together.
[312:46.40]When it's chained up, there's no problem.
[312:47.82]But of course, when that thing's loose, we're in a heap of trouble.
[312:51.00]Oh, yes.
[312:51.68]That beast's owner always burnt hands.
[312:53.70]It's pitiful.
[312:56.14]Alright, well.
[312:57.72]So where do we have to... Where?
[312:59.30]Let me get that first.
[313:00.72]Hold on.
[313:06.46]Are there any goopers in chat tonight?
[313:08.17]I'm sure there's at least 20.
[313:10.31]Alright, let's find out where this is.
[313:15.07]I see it.
[313:15.43]Okay, it's all the way back here.
[313:16.63]Oh, they have signs.
[313:18.33]Alright.
[313:37.90]Alright, you ready?
[313:38.46]Let him go!
[313:38.86]Three, two, one, let him go!
[313:41.10]Alright, let him go!
[313:48.88]Undo the nail!
[314:05.44]Come on!
[314:10.25]Well, actually, go this way.
[314:11.47]What the hell?
[314:24.91]Actually, keep going this way.
[314:25.75]Keep going.
[314:39.58]Alright, he's go- Really, Mario, you gotta be fucking shitting me.
[315:13.73]Come on!
[315:16.45]You're going, you're taking a bath.
[315:22.22]No!
[315:44.41]He's in the same spot he was in last time.
[316:01.96]If you aim, you stand still, and then he runs away.
[316:24.50]Pound his nail back in?
[316:31.23]Pound his fucking nail back in?!
[316:32.93]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[316:38.07]I almost have water.
[316:46.08]Hey, hey, hey!
[316:47.38]What?! !
[316:56.55]Wait, what do you mean?
[316:57.99]He was nailed in!
[316:58.85]I need water.
[317:05.73]Just so he can go fuck off somewhere for a little bit.
[317:07.60]I need fountain.
[317:19.52]Didn't nail it all the way.
[317:20.70]Start over.
[317:41.12]you rage quit the bath level he was going no he's got I now I understand what the hell is going on
[318:06.20]Yes, hi, I'm here to take care of him.
[318:07.78]Okay, bye.
[318:08.16]Alright, let him go.
[318:10.82]This is the calm level?
[318:15.22]This is not the calm level.
[318:25.81]Go.
[318:30.13]Get up there.
[318:34.67]He's really stinky.
[318:35.89]I'm sure he is.
[318:39.06]Alright, let's stop him.
[318:58.49]Watch the shotgun again.
[318:59.43]You have to be holding it, right?
[319:20.16]I mean, just go.
[319:22.50]Just let him go.
[319:23.44]He's gonna walk around in a circle anyways.
[320:00.90]Come here, you motherfucker.
[320:04.34]Get in here.
[320:06.54]Get in the bath.
[320:08.25]I got in the bath.
[320:12.25]Stay in there.
[320:13.25]What the fuck?
[320:13.81]You lied to me.
[320:30.80]This is a SpongeBob episode.
[320:32.26]God damn it.
[320:35.42]Get in here.
[320:36.32]Get in the bath.
[320:38.62]Get in the bath.
[320:46.26]Gary, get in the bath.
[320:48.94]Meow.
[320:50.40]Gary.
[320:51.66]Gary.
[320:52.42]Meow.
[321:17.31]Thank you for the five community subs, Mr. Dask.
[321:21.17]Thanks a lot.
[321:30.66]Are you available?
[321:31.44]Uh, not too many requests.
[321:34.24]I had to stop saying that.
[321:39.31]Just stop saying that.
[321:41.89]Secret of the Village Underside.
[321:43.66]I just saw a big blue diamond thing show up.
[321:52.97]That's 5,000 bits.
[321:58.29]That's $50.
[321:58.77]You guys have been doing... The last two days has been like money central.
[322:08.75]And it was Goiki.
[322:10.73]Goiki, thanks for the 5,000 bits, 50 bucks.
[322:13.22]Is it better to have pogged and lost or to never have pogged at all?
[322:23.96]That's better to have pogged and lost.
[322:25.51]Absolutely.
[322:32.55]Even as old folks are starting to get excited about this.
[322:34.57]Oh, and before I forget, I am not the mayor.
[322:37.17]If you're looking for him, he's probably by that yellow mushroom.
[322:40.06]Alright, so I need a yellow, uh, I don't know, whatever they are.
[322:43.40]Like a papaya?
[322:45.19]What is it?
[323:02.15]Is that... You're not the mayor.
[323:06.94]Looking for a papaya.
[323:12.60]Those of you that are, uh... Those of you that have been around the channel for a while, you know that papaya is a B, C tier fruit, according to me.
[323:23.41]Mom, it feels like it's getting close to fluff festival time.
[323:26.55]Where's the papaya?
[323:41.41]Where is it?
[323:43.80]Your seat here.
[323:45.48]Oh yeah?
[323:48.84]You think so?
[323:55.26]I'll have you know that I'm a B+.
[323:58.33]That's according to all the data collection places.
[324:04.63]Stream stats.
[324:07.43]I have a B+.
[324:10.03]For best streamer of the year.
[324:11.15]Did it go down to a B-?
[324:16.66]It's still fine.
[324:24.25]What did I do all that for?
[324:38.56]I just love going to find one fruit to bring back to give the Yoshi egg.
[324:57.24]Give me this fucking thing.
[325:06.13]You could be A-plus if you streamed as Bugleberry.
[325:08.25]I don't think that's true.
[325:09.09]Okay.
[325:17.90]So this is secret now.
[325:20.40]What am I looking for?
[325:30.94]Something I should... Where do I go with the ocean?
[325:34.06]Mushrooms?
[325:36.26]Alright, okay.
[325:36.94]So, I gotta go down... Does it matter?
[325:39.24]I'll probably go down the hole that... Yeah, I'm gonna go down the hole that I went down before.
[325:43.06]This one, right?
[325:44.86]Uh...
[326:14.40]This music is kind of really loud It's just playing the same loop over and over again
[326:46.64]I found it Yoshi, are you alright?
[327:00.48]Yoshi?
[327:24.62]I didn't know what the fuck that was Another one of these goddamn things I'm gonna oh that's gonna be look at how look at how much there is Why are there people here
[327:45.97]I'm a chuckster!
[328:16.99]He almost threw me off.
[328:17.73]Frick.
[328:24.82]Are you a Chuckster?
[328:28.42]Oh!
[328:38.34]Okay, this one goes up.
[328:45.43]Holy shit, he still hits too much!
[328:58.44]I like this one, this one's great.
[329:01.45]This one sucks, but I like it.
[329:12.69]Wait.
[329:17.83]Can I push him?
[329:18.57]Hey.
[329:22.98]Throw me over this way.
[329:39.60]I don't think... How could you get less accurate than what I just did?
[329:44.28]I think I can influence it a little bit.
[329:46.68]A little.
[329:47.32]Okay.
[329:48.06]Throw me.
[330:09.66]No, no, no, no.
[330:10.28]Can I back up?
[330:10.84]Back up!
[330:14.64]I came at him at a weird angle.
[330:27.55]Jeremy, it's a school night.
[330:29.01]I don't go to school.
[330:44.07]Come on, throw me more, throw me more!
[330:48.89]Further, further!
[330:49.95]Why are you not hitting this?
[330:53.98]Truancy.
[330:54.98]Yeah, tru- Somebody, somebody tell the, somebody get the truancy on me.
[330:59.18]I, I haven't been to a class in 17 years.
[331:04.41]Somebody call the truancy on me.
[331:08.58]No, you!
[331:09.06]Because look, there's a wall there.
[331:41.28]That was far.
[331:51.69]I bounced off the rip.
[331:53.17]Oh my god, whatever.
[331:55.17]Thankfully, I can stay here forever.
[331:57.61]Actually, forever.
[331:58.39]And by the way, can I just... Nope.
[332:22.45]Throw me, throw me real far.
[332:30.49]And go.
[332:33.99]Good.
[332:35.59]I need you all the way.
[332:36.39]Okay.
[332:37.18]You now have to be.
[332:40.04]I need you all the way in front of me here.
[332:41.52]And I got to get this right.
[332:45.00]Right there is alright.
[332:45.84]No, it's not good enough.
[332:47.26]That's good.
[332:48.06]Is this okay?
[332:49.28]I think so.
[332:51.64]Higher, higher.
[332:52.22]He almost threw me to the... Alright, do you guys... Any of you guys ever play Little League?
[333:04.28]I used to play Little League and we had these... There was like two or three fields that were right next to each other.
[333:09.24]You'd have the one outfield would be... There would be another outfield.
[333:13.79]It'd be two or three of them right next to each other, right?
[333:16.47]And there was always that kid that hit a home run every other at-bat.
[333:22.33]And sometimes he would hit it over the fence and it would go into the other field even while they were playing a game.
[333:30.03]They would do it all, it would happen all the fucking time.
[333:32.33]It would fuck up so many plays because like the big strong eighth grader could hit the ball almost to the pitcher's mound on the other field.
[333:43.71]That's just so so dangerous.
[334:11.68]Now I've sealed my fate.
[334:12.70]I don't care if we're here all night.
[334:14.01]I'm alright with this.
[334:15.87]I don't have a problem with this.
[334:31.50]Now this guy throws so hard.
[334:35.74]He throws as hard as he can, so I have to hold back.
[334:42.13]Say goodnight to me.
[334:42.85]Goodnight!
[334:45.25]Okay, so now I'm...
[334:57.12]I... Wait.
[334:58.52]I'm not up there?
[335:06.05]Okay, so... Am I going through a fucking portal?
[335:18.38]What's going on?
[335:19.14]Throw me!
[335:21.12]Okay, there we go.
[335:27.72]So... What about these guys?
[335:31.82]I don't get this.
[335:32.60]Why are they all here?
[335:33.14]Why are you all here?
[335:35.00]I don't get it.
[335:35.60]Why are they here?
[335:36.36]Wait, is this just a mess with you?
[335:40.30]I get it.
[335:41.27]Throw.
[335:41.69]Um...
[335:58.71]Somebody over there?
[336:02.89]You... Which way did you throw?
[336:05.67]Which way does this person throw?
[336:12.74]You definitely throw over there, right?
[336:14.12]Is that a...
[336:37.99]Alright, come here.
[336:39.03]That's lined up, I think.
[336:58.04]It's gotta be on the other side.
[336:59.56]Yeah, on the other side.
[337:00.94]What are you doing?
[337:03.16]I don't know.
[337:04.92]I was overthinking that.
[337:17.67]Just throw me.
[337:24.82]I thought I had to get thrown to the other side and then... Whatever.
[337:36.93]Pass.
[337:38.95]Sick.
[337:41.11]Pass me that way, please.
[337:45.95]well he's a chuckster yeah he is a chuckster this way that way
[338:33.17]he threw you to your death ah I need to get I don't miss this
[338:51.21]Don't rush it.
[338:51.83]If I rush it, I'm just going to throw it off the edge.
[339:02.73]The problem I have with that one where he throws you way up high is if I hold back too much, then I just go right back down.
[339:07.52]But if I don't hold it at all or I do it too little, you really... Why?
[339:12.60]Come on.
[339:42.71]You can control yourself in the air.
[339:43.95]I know.
[339:45.99]But if I hold... If I do back too much, it's a really... It's a lot of finessing in the air when you can't really see where you are.
[340:09.22]Hold forward?
[340:10.40]I will go across the whole map if I hold forward.
[340:15.16]And what is this doing this for?
[340:18.87]Is he tilted?
[340:19.67]I was facing straight ahead.
[340:42.43]Game sucks.
[340:43.31]Streamer sucks.
[340:44.41]I'm going to bed.
[340:47.73]Wait, it can't be both, okay?
[340:50.17]You gotta pick one.
[340:51.17]You gotta pick one and stick with it.
[341:23.59]What?
[341:25.13]Why?
[341:25.63]Okay, I did this like six times in a row, doing the same thing.
[341:36.09]And now all of a sudden it's not- I got it wrong.
[341:57.55]I can't get like more straight than this I'm not gonna do it again, I didn't
[342:42.01]Holy shit, that was close.
[342:43.11]Alright, just do it quickly quickly go go go go go right here Okay, here we go, this is it
[343:08.01]I can't tell.
[343:10.01]I'm not ready yet.
[343:10.81]I'm not ready for this.
[343:11.79]Not yet.
[343:13.46]I'm not ready for this.
[343:14.26]Is that?
[343:14.66]No, that's not right.
[343:15.54]I got a little bit more to the left.
[343:42.00]Lion's gonna be right between my legs I love having a big fucking rectangle in the way
[344:18.96]It was as if I was standing, like, at a full 40 to 50 degrees to my right.
[344:31.53]I saw, I saw, good, do it now, good, now, I agree with you.
[344:36.78]I wasn't.
[344:39.05]What the fuck?
[344:42.09]There's only so many pixels that Mario's body can turn.
[344:45.49]You know what I mean?
[344:47.27]There's only so much finite movements he can make.
[345:07.51]Alright, well, whatever.
[345:10.12]There you go.
[345:12.62]These things are getting fucking deleted.
[345:15.34]On Sunday, by the way.
[345:17.28]You're never gonna see one ever again.
[345:18.38]This has got me so paranoid that it's not correct.
[346:07.87]What the fuck?
[346:09.33]Wait, what?
[346:11.09]What the fuck?
[346:13.70]Oh my god.
[346:18.24]What the hell?
[346:25.90]The angle's bad?
[346:43.46]It was too far back.
[346:44.69]Didn't I go over it?
[346:47.29]Where did I fall then?
[346:51.65]I undershot it?
[347:17.71]That right... No, fuck.
[347:44.70]He's gonna push me though if I, uh... Oh!
[347:51.77]Alright, let's go.
[348:13.18]Fuck you!
[348:41.17]I can't tell.
[348:46.50]This is too... No, that's too far to the right.
[348:57.36]Just go straight... What do you think I'm doing?
[348:59.59]Is that it?
[349:25.17]I mean, I can't get it any better than this, I don't think.
[349:35.37]Can I ground pound out of this?
[349:39.89]A line?
[349:40.37]Yeah, I tried last time.
[349:41.89]How's that?
[349:51.07]I think it's a little too much to the right.
[349:55.32]That's perfect?
[349:56.64]I don't think so.
[349:57.24]I don't think that's correct.
[350:09.46]It's good.
[350:10.18]Go.
[350:10.54]Do it.
[350:11.12]I'm gonna do it.
[350:12.02]If I get thrown 500 feet to the right, then this whole thing is stupid.
[350:23.93]Wake up, Mario.
[350:35.75]Is the angle between your camera and his camera?
[350:40.35]Who else has a fucking camera?
[350:55.23]I had to actually wake his ass up.
[350:56.77]Are you kidding me?
[351:23.31]What do you think?
[351:23.75]Do you think we're good?
[351:34.92]I can't tell.
[351:38.56]The Chalkster's position is more important than yours.
[351:40.56]Okay, here we go.
[351:55.61]What the fuck, man?
[351:57.37]This shouldn't be this ridiculous.
[351:59.60]Just do it.
[352:00.50]What the fuck?
[352:23.70]He's gonna walk into me, isn't he?
[352:25.46]Oh, god damn it.
[352:54.50]That's not, he's not in the right spot.
[352:56.34]He's not, he's gotta turn.
[352:57.34]I think that's it.
[353:02.03]Jeremy, did you do it?
[353:03.23]I did it.
[353:12.26]Holy fuck, that was horrible.
[353:35.76]Is that it?
[353:38.56]Remember, you are not a chuckster.
[353:55.39]That's fine.
[353:58.80]That doesn't bother me.
[353:59.44]I just went away for a bit, and now look, I can't believe it.
[354:04.84]Another fine mess, and it's all a doozy.
[354:06.66]Some of the villagers are trapped in that burning ooze.
[354:08.63]Go save them!
[354:09.23]Ten people, three minutes!
[354:11.47]YouTuber voice.
[354:14.15]You know the drill.
[354:24.00]Well, stop talking and get the fuck out of my way, dingus.
[354:33.71]Somehow I got my- I hit my head.
[354:35.09]You trapped?
[354:40.89]You're good.
[354:53.87]You're not gonna light back on fire, right?
[354:54.97]I don't think so.

[360:05.39]Where is this dude?

[362:56.09]Like, you're really going to keep doing this?
[363:21.84]Alright, where's the police station?
[363:30.23]It's like a little corner somewhere over here, right?
[363:38.12]I'm going there.
[363:38.76]Like over here?
[363:42.60]Where is it?
[363:43.62]Where is this police station?
[363:45.06]Oh, not that way.
[363:52.98]Where's the fruit?
[363:53.60]Okay, so... Where am I going?
[364:08.85]What's wrong with you?
[364:13.99]Unforgivable!

[365:07.79]Whoa!
[365:09.51]Whoa!
[365:17.34]Whoa!
[365:25.15]Was I supposed to jump?
[365:27.53]Holy shit!
[365:36.94]But how?
[365:44.98]I'm good.
[365:54.63]That was almost a hyper omega choke at the end.
[365:58.95]I would have been so sad.
[366:01.29]I almost panic jumped off the edge.
[366:03.31]I almost omega choked.
[366:04.87]That would have been so bad.
[366:08.34]Okay, I want to go do the... Turn this stuff on.
[366:24.30]Or do I?
[366:28.59]Or do... Alright, I got a question for you.
[366:30.73]So... What is the... We did like six and a half hours yesterday.
[366:38.70]Six and a half... Six to six and a half today.
[366:41.84]What's the... We got like another... How much longer we got?
[366:45.98]Like another six to seven hours?
[366:47.36]What do you think?
[366:57.22]Another s- will there be a- is there another stream?
[367:00.47]Two to three hours?
[367:01.17]Okay.
[367:03.13]Unless you want to 100%.
[367:03.95]Depends on how many you do.
[367:08.07]Two to four hours?
[367:08.79]Okay.
[367:17.56]Depends on how much you choke.
[367:28.25]Well, that's cool.
[367:28.87]I can... Well, hi.
[367:33.72]Um... I need Yoshi over here.
[367:38.78]You can finish this in an hour if you wanted to.
[367:41.70]I'm not sure I want to rush through it.
[367:45.38]I don't think I just want to... What do I have?
[367:48.37]58?
[367:48.39]60?
[367:49.59]I'm not sure I want to just finish it quickly, hurry up, and be done.
[367:55.97]like to try to at least get another like 10 to 15 stars at least get to like 70 80. I mean I've played this game before it's not like I'm like alright let's finish it okay bye I'm done oh I got 60 stars and beat the game and uh turn it off and delete it so I think we'll call it here
[368:28.35]This is a good stopping point?
[368:29.41]Okay.
[368:30.87]It is getting a little late.
[368:33.44]Not for me, but for a lot of you other guys.
[368:36.24]Yeah, this is gonna be six hours.
[368:38.70]It'll be about six and a half, seven with the bits.
[368:40.56]Yeah, this is a good place.
[368:43.74]I think it makes sense.
[368:45.12]We'll finish it tomorrow.
[368:46.64]And we'll do, uh... We'll keep doing it until I'm kind of done.
[368:52.64]Even if I beat the game, I might still try to get a few stars and just play it.
[368:57.71]I've never played it before.
[369:01.23]Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[369:03.21]Tomorrow, same time, around probably 3.

[369:24.95]Pacific.
[369:27.40]Sorry, I said the noises were funnier than you.
[369:29.12]Well, it wasn't accurate.
[369:30.48]Well, I mean, it wasn't inaccurate.
[369:35.56]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[369:41.81]Are you eating?
[369:42.31]Hey, just don't talk about eating anything.
[369:44.81]What are you trying to do?
[369:46.87]You're not supposed to be leaking that info.
[369:54.53]But, well, we'll see you tomorrow.
[369:56.74]Thanks for stopping by, guys.
[369:57.62]If you check us out tomorrow, we're going to be playing more Mario Sunshine until I beat it, until I'm done and full.
[370:02.20]And then we'll see what we're going to do after that.
[370:07.08]Thanks for watching.
[370:07.62]See you tomorrow.
[370:07.98]I had a blast, as always.
[370:12.45]This game is something I've never experienced, so it's really fun to experience it brand new.
[370:15.73]See you tomorrow.
[370:21.32]For the rest of you, let's go back earlier today
[370:27.39]Let's rewind.

[371:50.10]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[371:52.86]Tag me when Jerm is upset.
[371:54.02]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[371:55.80]It happened a couple times today.
[372:00.46]Some of those secret levels.
[372:03.42]Couldn't contain my frustrations.
[372:06.21]But it's okay.
[372:08.59]Sometimes it happens.
[372:14.24]all spring a couple what it was like twice it was when I was we were doing the secret levels and I talked about how well I talk about a whole world here right I thought one of the whole level yeah I did alright
[372:35.09]nail fucking nail yeah that was not even a meltdown though that was a adhd issue that was not a meltdown you can't this doesn't count but uh thanks for the three bucks thank you lizard amoebo for the 250 I'm spending today making an archive of all my mom's beanie babies for her thanks for giving me something to watch while I do that
[373:06.87]Probably worth some money.
[373:07.57]Beanie babies.
[373:10.34]That's pretty cool.
[373:12.28]I remember those things.
[373:15.28]That's very nice of you.
[373:17.25]Thanks for the 250.
[373:18.73]Hope you got them all sorted.
[373:22.63]Windar, thanks for the five dollars.
[373:25.66]Ew, Sniff, Sniff, oh yeah, Jerma Weed, that's the good shit.
[373:29.60]Anyway, Jerma, I love the streams.
[373:30.84]I was also curious if you've ever heard of King Gizzard and the Wizard Lizard.
[373:36.48]It's a really awesome band that you might enjoy.
[373:38.38]If you haven't, you should check them out.
[373:40.24]There's a great album called In Your Mind to get introduced to them.
[373:48.27]I've seen a lot of pogs.
[373:50.29]Yeah, I'll check it out.
[373:57.63]Thanks for the $5.
[373:58.05]I'll give it a check.
[374:02.61]Espada Escalada, thanks for the $2.50.
[374:04.23]Had the same exact bad facial hair pattern.
[374:06.15]I feel your pain.
[374:09.65]Yeah, would I love to have a decent beard or something?
[374:12.72]Maybe, but I'm not sure it would even work on me.
[374:15.46]I've kind of got... I'm not sure a lot of facial hair would work.
[374:26.62]I like the way that I can make my face look now.
[374:32.90]It's all good.
[374:36.16]I like this stream.
[374:38.17]I like that you like this stream.
[374:41.79]Thanks for the three bucks.
[374:42.47]Maybe.
[374:44.29]After Mario Sunshine, though, I would like to...
[374:57.68]get away from the GameCube and the Wii for a little while.
[375:01.04]And by a little while, I mean a week or two.
[375:02.80]Just because we've done a lot of GameCube and a lot of Wii.
[375:08.48]The majority of the streams have been GameCube or Wii games for almost the last two weeks.
[375:19.70]We will come back to it.
[375:20.54]There's still tons of shit that I have.
[375:24.48]We'll see.
[375:27.11]What's wrong with that?
[375:27.91]No, nothing wrong with that.
[375:31.59]I just like to... I like to mix it up a little bit.
[375:38.39]Paper Mario... Paper Mario is long.
[375:41.74]That's fine, though.
[375:42.50]I'm... The streams of yesteryear are not the streams of today year.
[375:50.29]Obviously, me streaming Mario Sunshine three days in a row, four days in a row, is something I probably never would have done a few years ago.
[376:01.80]I never used to play the same game more than one or two streams.
[376:06.50]I would just abandon it because I just didn't think people would stay interested.
[376:10.32]And I don't think I would stay interested.
[376:14.49]So, I'm... It's not like... It's not a big deal.
[376:22.70]Sorcery was a different case because sorcery was one of my favorite things ever.
[376:36.36]Streaming sorcery 10 to 12 times and that's just one of my favorite experiences.
[376:48.33]Yeah.
[376:50.32]But I never write off any game.
[376:51.82]I never say that I'm not gonna do something, so... It's definitely a chance.
[376:57.01]It's a very long time.
[376:57.69]I forget that a lot.
[376:58.33]That... Next year...
[377:19.85]is 10 straight years doing this 2021 will be 10 full years doing either youtube or Twitch without stopping
[377:35.58]There's been a couple of times when I haven't been around for a couple weeks.
[377:39.28]Two or three weeks is the maximum I think I've ever not been around.
[377:43.08]But I've been around at least every week or two for 10 years.
[377:48.43]That's crazy to think about that.
[377:57.73]Oh, there absolutely will be an anniversary stream.
[378:10.67]I knew you from the servers.
[378:12.17]See?
[378:12.61]Somebody's here that knows me from the servers.
[378:16.05]Gigantic air quotes.
[378:21.61]But, uh, yeah.
[378:23.67]Thank you for the 10 bucks, CDT.
[378:26.25]Glad to have you around.
[378:27.07]Thanks for sticking around for so long.
[378:30.80]Toadside Picnic, thanks for the 300 bits.
[378:32.80]Jerma, fellow mass hole here.
[378:34.94]Do you miss the chaotic yet inexpensive atmosphere that is Market Basket?
[378:39.76]I do miss something very specific from Market Basket.
[378:42.72]Market Basket had probably the best ginger ale.
[378:47.74]They had a golden ginger ale.
[378:49.54]It was Market Basket golden ginger ale brand.
[378:52.74]It's probably the best ginger ale I've had.
[378:54.82]Nothing can really replace it.
[378:57.74]Unfortunate.
[379:04.35]If you know, you know.
[379:06.87]I could probably order it somehow, but it'd be weird.
[379:13.97]It'd be weird.
[379:15.55]But yeah, I did get stuff from there.
[379:21.84]Thanks to the 300 bits.
[379:27.23]Let's put on the credits.
[379:32.96]we can switch this don't you love how I haven't had this highest tip bit leader top sub thing to work I've never got it to work once people just are waiting for that to happen this never happened once this is just no one no one's getting there's no top sub gift here ever like I'm not ever gonna get this fixed it kind of worked the first week yeah and then just stopped
[379:59.76]Well, it's those people in the chairs.
[380:01.10]That's what you don't understand.
[380:02.52]It's always that guy in the chair.
[380:04.20]It's always the slug.
[380:05.32]And it's always the... Animorph.
[380:10.60]Someday we'll know.
[380:12.77]Someday we will know.
[380:15.41]We will.
[380:16.81]That day is not today, unfortunately.
[380:24.37]Anyways, as always, thanks again, guys.
[380:28.96]We'll hopefully see you tomorrow.
[380:30.84]For the... Holy shit, that's a lot of people.
[380:34.27]For the conclusion of Mario Sunshine.
[380:35.95]However long that takes.
[380:42.76]That's fast.
[380:51.10]are three or four more bits to do as these insane credits roll out from the hundreds of gifted subs and hundreds of regular subs it's not just the gifted subs thanks guys remember the new year's stream that was ridiculous I think that new year's stream I think there were two to three thousand subs on that stream
[381:25.79]That was out of control.
[381:35.12]He fucking loves us.
[381:37.80]Of course I do.
[381:40.44]What do you think this is?
[381:44.07]Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for the 500 bits.
[381:45.49]This is one of my favorite childhood games and I'm so happy you're finally jumping and diving.
[381:49.72]I've been spamming it every once in a while.
[381:51.36]The movement mechanics is one of the best things about the game.
[381:53.48]Also, spray water on the birds.
[381:57.39]I will.
[382:00.72]Again, bubble swag, five more dolls here.
[382:02.40]That one spot you found to get Yoshi over there on that island is completely awful.
[382:06.84]If you want to cheese it, here's a video.
[382:09.39]You can get Yoshi out of bounds super easily into that island, but, like, it's not necessary or anything.
[382:15.29]Just a trick heads up from me, your pal.
[382:22.14]Getting Yoshi over there is awful.
[382:25.22]Maybe I'll give it a look.
[382:33.50]Use noclip on the emulator?
[382:42.65]Goosely charmed, thanks to the 250.
[382:44.21]Hey Jerma, first time donator.
[382:45.47]Wanted to share something that happened at work.
[382:48.29]I was running late to a meeting and it was my turn to present.
[382:52.50]I airplayed my computer screen and some audio of a guy talking started playing.
[382:57.86]I was so confused for a few seconds till I realized I had paused a video of yours and it had started auto-playing.
[383:05.22]All I can say is thank God you were being somewhat normal and not crying to farting and screaming.
[383:11.81]Anyways, love the stream.
[383:13.75]Oh, man.
[383:18.05]What's the over-under?
[383:18.77]Okay, if you took every single stream I've ever done and calculate how many hours that stream was, all of them together...
[383:27.31]and then rolled dice to pick a time spot on that gigantic 100 to 2,000, 5,000 plus hour video, what's the over-under that it would be something fucking ridiculous or something fucked up that was happening on the stream?
[383:50.06]Wouldn't be 100%. 70%?
[383:56.35]If I was a psycho, which I'm not, I'm not.
[384:06.69]Imagine if we did a coin toss RNG stream where it's every stream I've ever done.
[384:15.05]And every 10 minutes we pull the fucking lever and it picks a random spot in like 2000 hours of 4,000 hours of streaming.
[384:34.50]That would be kind of fun.
[384:41.32]Do that for the anniversary.
[384:45.51]That's a massive video file.
[384:47.33]I don't think that would be possible.
[384:50.93]Yeah, that would be a video file that was thousands of hours long.
[384:54.19]I don't think that's possible.
[385:03.35]I have a 50 terabyte, but I would have to get an external hard drive that was a petabyte or something.
[385:12.37]I'm going to hold on to that because that's so dumb that it might be worth doing.
[385:18.49]Set up a generator that takes videos from the archive channel and gives you a random timestamp.
[385:26.08]Yeah, I'll look into this.
[385:28.62]I'm actually going to for real look into this.
[385:40.23]Put all the streams in a playlist and roll the dice to choose the stream to do and then roll again to choose the video.
[385:45.93]And time.
[385:48.05]It's possible.
[385:48.86]It's very possible.
[385:49.62]Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
[385:59.70]We'll do that.
[386:02.44]Put it on the list.
[386:05.10]Anyways, we had, um...
[386:09.17]$30.
[386:09.19]$30.
[386:09.21]3,000 bits from Atlantis.
[386:12.79]Thanks for the $30 drop, dude.
[386:14.03]I wanted to ask if you ever plan on doing some kind of live in-person show.
[386:20.91]I'd be willing to go to Vegas and watch you perform in some way.
[386:23.88]It hasn't really come up.
[386:29.90]But something about that is very, very funny to me.
[386:33.98]If I somehow got to rent out one of the theaters...
[386:39.42]On the strip or something.
[386:41.76]And for two nights only.
[386:44.34]I did just a terrible show.
[386:47.80]It was an hour or two long.
[386:54.87]That would be so bad.
[386:55.99]And make a fake, almost infomercial-esque commercial and trailer for it.
[387:06.79]And play that for a couple weeks before it happens and start selling tickets and stuff.
[387:16.80]Make the tickets $200.
[387:17.52]Oh, that would be a real asshole thing to do.
[387:23.12]Eklers in the crowd.
[387:29.67]Put a bunch of plants in to fake laugh at stuff and only sell 50 tickets.
[387:35.84]And hire a thousand people to come and crack the fuck up at everything.
[387:39.52]And get cameras and film a live special.
[387:49.03]Have two people in the audience be actual real people.
[387:52.75]And the rest are just plants.
[387:55.29]Don't tell any of them.
[388:02.64]At that point, that's just an elaborate prank on two people.
[388:07.72]That's stupid.
[388:13.89]Put it on the list.
[388:17.65]Thanks for the $30, though, dude.
[388:19.01]Thank you, Goiki, for the 500 bits.
[388:20.55]My favorite part of the stream is when you do bad gaming.
[388:23.86]Hold on.
[388:24.72]My favorite part of the stream is when you do a bad gaming moment and you just get mad at Mario.
[388:29.00]Like, why did Mario just do that?
[388:35.34]Why?
[388:36.34]There are some things that he like jumps over the pole and shit without me pressing anything.
[388:40.93]Sometimes he does things without me doing anything.
[388:50.67]Arya's trying his best.
[388:54.46]Then who is controlling him?
[388:57.00]I am directing him, but he is in control.
[389:00.26]I am directing him with an analog stick, but he has to run.
[389:08.93]If you put an earpiece in my ear and said, up, right, down, up, up.
[389:14.43]If you just, I would, I would run up, but I still have to run.
[389:17.86]It's my legs.
[389:27.71]Is he here right now?
[389:41.28]Like, I'm on one of those TV shows where I'm telling you there's a ghost that lives in my house.
[389:46.06]And I start going, oh, oh, oh.
[389:50.36]Jeremy.
[389:52.26]Is he in the room right now?
[389:55.16]Yeah.
[389:55.60]Yep.
[389:57.24]Explain it to me.
[390:04.69]Hey, Blackout, thanks for the thousand bits.
[390:06.69]And that's our final bit of the night.
[390:09.99]Move over here.
[390:16.79]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[390:20.87]Blackout says for $10,000 bits.
[390:21.97]Thank you, Blackout.
[390:26.10]Ripping your earbuds out.
[390:57.95]Yeah, you just be like, I'm watching TV or something.
[391:02.35]Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[391:04.23]You listen to a funny podcast.
[391:11.65]I appreciate that, though.
[391:12.33]Thank you.
[391:14.57]No one's ever obligated to give this channel money.
[391:16.81]Some people give a lot.
[391:18.79]Some people give some.
[391:19.81]Some people don't give anything at all.
[391:21.29]And all that is completely fine.
[391:23.64]That's all perfectly fine.
[391:25.22]All of it.
[391:29.79]Don't feel obligated to give a cent to this channel.
[391:32.11]If you do, I really fucking appreciate it.
[391:33.93]If you don't, thanks for being here.
[391:35.58]Thanks for watching.
[391:37.60]You contribute as well.
[391:41.94]If a thousand of you guys, 2,000, 3,000 of you are not subbed to the channel, but you watch the stream, that does, that benefits the stream immensely.
[392:01.44]I will never give you money.
[392:02.84]And you should... That's totally fine.
[392:05.78]Don't worry about that.
[392:06.96]You don't have to ever.
[392:17.49]When will I know if Dermy's in financial trouble?
[392:21.05]If I do a Raid Shadow Legends ad on my stream.
[392:25.77]That's when you know something's wrong.
[392:39.12]Can I watch this stream while I'm nude?
[392:40.83]Yeah, go for it.
[392:50.92]See you guys tomorrow.
[392:53.00]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[392:54.30]Thanks for watching.
[392:54.92]Mario Sunshine.
[392:55.66]We're going to finish it tomorrow.
[392:57.38]Good night.
[392:58.36]Goodbye.
[392:59.80]Take care.
[393:00.53]See you soon.
[393:39.42]Thank you.
[394:14.00]so so
