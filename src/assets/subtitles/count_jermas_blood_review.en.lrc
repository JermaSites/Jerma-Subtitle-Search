[00:06.31]So let me leave no further ado here for a special guest review with me, sitting right there.
[00:14.04]Jeremiah?
[00:22.75]It's really thick.
[00:24.63]It's really thick.
[00:26.90]The flavor's not really there for me.
[00:29.56]It's a little lacking on flavor.
[00:35.30]Wait a second.
[00:36.46]That tastes like cheese.
[00:38.14]It tastes like cheese.
[00:39.31]There's just cheese.
[00:41.03]It tastes like it smells like the inside of a Cheetos bag.
[00:44.63]I just don't want it.
[00:45.40]I don't want the Cheetos flavor at dinner.
[00:48.44]I don't want to eat like a bag of Cheetos with a fucking steak.
[00:53.23]It's like, oh yeah, mashed potatoes, chicken, Cheetos.
[00:58.05]Like, oh, I almost just did it.
[00:59.18]You almost got it out of me.
[01:00.72]You almost got it.
[01:02.08]I could definitely see somebody eating this for a birthday party.
[01:05.88]I mean, it sucks.
[01:08.11]It's whatever.
