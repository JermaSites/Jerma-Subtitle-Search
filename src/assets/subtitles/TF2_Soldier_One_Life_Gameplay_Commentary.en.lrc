[00:09.61]Hey, what's happening, guys?
[00:10.65]It's Jerma again.
[00:11.65]I got a one-life gameplay for you.
[00:13.43]This is the series I'm continuing from before, where I show you one life from one class, and with a particular loadout that I choose.
[00:20.83]This is a soldier gameplay with one life.
[00:23.45]I kill 22 people in one life.
[00:26.37]It's an absolute massacre of a gameplay, and you'll see right off the bat get Kritzkrieg'd, and I just destroyed two or three people.
[00:32.91]I know that you can't kill sentries with a Kritzkrieg.
[00:35.73]I know there's no bonus to the Kritzkrieg if you are killing a sentry.
[00:39.41]I know that, so don't worry.
[00:41.21]This pyro goes down, and I'll tell you the loadout for the match.
[00:44.05]The loadout is the Liberty Launcher, Da Whip, and the Buff Banner.
[00:48.60]As you can see here, I have the Buff Banner ready to go, but we are just really, really crushing them right now, so I don't really see a need for it.
[00:54.80]But right here, there's a lot of people coming up, so I switch it out, blow the horn, and here we go.
[00:59.43]Time for some complete domination.
[01:02.03]I love the sound it makes when other people get crits.
[01:03.73]It's awesome.
[01:04.61]So all these people, my screen starts lagging because I just couldn't handle it.
[01:07.60]Kill one person here, get this Demoman.
[01:09.90]Sorry, I think I get the Pyro.
[01:10.86]I get the Pyro, sorry.
[01:12.32]Now we're spawn camping now, and this is bad news.
[01:15.08]Get that Engineer with a nice shot.
[01:17.03]This is bad news.
[01:18.05]In the middle here, I kind of tell people, I say, you know what, let them come out of the spawn, but we have our fun for a good five or six minutes.
[01:24.17]So Smart Soldier comes out with the Battalion's Backup, he blows it, they make a great push, but it's just not enough.
[01:30.19]I actually have, like, two pocket medics in this particular gameplay.
[01:34.00]Not right now, but this guy right here, he's a good, this guy Swift, he's my pocket medic for a while here.
[01:39.88]Kill a couple more people, and then he pops the uber, and there's nothing I can really do here.
[01:43.99]I kill this heavy, there's no one really around.
[01:46.67]Get the heavy with one shot, he tries to run away, and Mew, I get him.
[01:50.07]This pyro I believe he gets killed by the heavy right next to me and then I get Kritzkrieged. I was like: Oh no!
[01:53.07]Because I blew the horn and I would have definitely waited but I killed two or three people with this too, this Kritzkrieg.
[01:59.07]So I get ubered and Kritzkrieged, so everybody else on the server I'm sorry that you didn't get to uh... use these two medics to your advantage.
[02:09.38]Heavy medic pair on the way out.
[02:10.64]I'm not going to get myself killed.
[02:12.24]Me and Larry, the combat spy, just hanging out back here behind this rock, taking a little detour.
[02:17.48]Charging the Buff Banner on all those people that come out.
[02:19.56]And then there's a spy that turns around the corner.
[02:21.59]There he is.
[02:22.49]Definitely a Dead Ringer, but it's not a problem at all because he charged my Buff Banner.
[02:27.01]Blow the horn and guys watch this, like eight people die because of being a pyro.
[02:31.00]Check this out, look at him. There he is on the left. Just like absolutely smoking people because of the crits. Unbelievable.
[02:36.00]We kill like eight people collectively together and I guess I also had the uber from the Quick-Fix on me, which I was not aware of until watching this gameplay.
[02:46.00]I guess I was just so in the moment right there that I just wasn't even paying attention to that, but that was definitely a reason why we pushed so well right there.
[02:53.65]Uber heavy on the cart, but it doesn't matter.
[02:55.57]My team is very, very good right now.
[02:57.57]We're very confident in what we have for our position.
[03:00.29]So we make our way back up here, and they're in their spawn again.
[03:03.94]They haven't been able to come past this rocky area right here for the entire match.
[03:08.42]So it's really not a good thing to spawn camp and to keep people here, which is why you'll see eventually I make people go back.
[03:14.10]I say, guys, guys, guys.
[03:16.08]Don't do this anymore.
[03:17.15]This is stupid.
[03:17.91]I'd rather have a challenge.
[03:19.09]I'd rather have them be able to get out.
[03:20.45]Because when you're getting spawn camped, it's very, very difficult to even get out of the spawn, and it's just not fair.
[03:25.87]So let's get a crit streak here now.
[03:28.03]Bang, get this one guy.
[03:29.11]And then I get ubered again from the Quick-Fix.
[03:30.89]You'll see I was just pocketed the whole time by like two or three different people, like I said before.
[03:36.66]So I apologize again.
[03:38.48]Blow the horn for the banner, and we just are at their spawn again.
[03:41.88]That's all there is to it.
[03:42.76]We're just at their spawn again, and they can't even get out.
[03:46.22]And this is just bad news.
[03:47.25]Look at this.
[03:47.67]Just shooting randomly into the spawn, getting kills.
[03:50.77]Lucky crit on that heavy, and then he just dies by, I think he got headshot, actually.
[03:56.07]This is the point right now where I'm saying over the mic, everybody back up.
[04:00.24]Everyone get to the point.
[04:01.82]Let's forget this.
[04:02.80]Don't spawn camp.
[04:03.84]And everyone listens to me.
[04:04.86]We all come back here.
[04:05.72]See how we're all just running this way.
[04:07.47]We're all in this little cubby area.
[04:08.95]You'll see it's kind of funny.
[04:09.69]Look at, like, everybody just sitting there.
[04:11.69]We wanted to give them at least 10 to 15 seconds to get out of the spawn.
[04:15.19]There they are.
[04:15.84]They're all out now, and it really just didn't matter at all.
[04:20.34]I get ubered again, and we come back, and look at where we end up after this push that they have.
[04:25.31]We end up right back in their spawn.
[04:28.45]Lucky crit on that heavy, goes down.
[04:30.00]And this soldier watch is funny, he just turns around he's like you know what screw this.
[04:33.00]I'm just gonna run the other way with the Equalizer.
[04:35.00]Probably a good idea and now look at where we are. We're all back at their spawn again.
[04:41.00]And at this point there's only a minute and a half left I just said you know what screw it whatever.
[04:44.00]I tried- I tried to let people come out of the spawn but it just didn't matter.
[04:50.01]Only reason why I came back here was to make sure there was no scouts or no spies that would potentially be able to cap the point or even get on the cart.
[04:56.76]I just wanted to make sure that we could just end this without a problem.
[04:59.54]Blow the banner, and here comes the cavalry.
[05:01.45]That's a spy.
[05:02.31]I know it.
[05:02.69]He tries to face stab me, but I do a self-destruct kill on him.
[05:07.27]Once again, when we get down here, I get critskrieged again.
[05:10.34]And I don't know, you'll see, where the hell did this guy's teleporter go?
[05:14.32]Look at this.
[05:15.16]Where did that thing go?
[05:16.70]Get a few kills.
[05:17.44]I actually kill him.
[05:18.42]See, I kill him right before he gets on the teleporter.
[05:20.70]Where did that thing go?
[05:22.67]If you were in this server and you were on blue team when this happened, tell me where that teleporter went.
[05:27.15]Because I'm really curious to know.
[05:30.17]At this point in the match now, somebody was screaming over the mic.
[05:33.16]They're saying, oh, my God, get to the cart.
[05:34.82]There's like a bunch of people here.
[05:36.46]So I was like, oh, geez.
[05:37.74]So I blow the banner.
[05:38.66]Of course, I had one again.
[05:39.96]And there's a heavy medic on the cart.
[05:42.05]It doesn't matter.
[05:42.75]They go down.
[05:43.87]And look at this.
[05:45.05]I am screwed here.
[05:46.25]I'm like, no, no, I'm having such a good round.
[05:48.31]Please don't kill me.
[05:49.29]I whip you to death.
[05:50.43]And that's the end.
[05:51.43]22 kills in one life.
[05:55.10]And that's the one life as the soldier in this gameplay.
[05:58.90]Thank you all for watching so much, guys.
[06:00.94]I really appreciate it.
[06:02.66]I'll leave the rest of the gameplay up so you guys can see that I scoot-dugand like a goose.
[06:07.51]Scoot-dugand like a goose.
[06:10.25]And I'll see you guys later.
[06:11.81]Take care, everybody.
