[00:05.20]Hello dissenters, my name is Etalyx and I am here today with some more Team Fortress 2 and the new man versus machine game type playing this time on the Man Works map in the Man Up game mode.
[00:17.84]And that is to be distinguished from my last video which was just a regular community server and not the Man Up game type.
[00:24.75]So I wanted to just kinda explain the differences between those and just kinda give you guys some more gameplay and I've got some live commentary coming about halfway through this video.
[00:32.78]playing as the Heavy this time with the Brass Beast and the Sandvich and the Killing Gloves of Boxing, which I don't get to use, but I got Burgah Boy healing me, doing me a favor, keeping me alive as long as possible, and I just... This game mode is just a lot of fun.
[00:47.51]It's just...
[00:48.32]I don't know, something about the upgrade system that keeps me coming back for more.
[00:51.60]Yes, I can see it as something that doesn't have a lot of longevity, at least in its basic form, without any more additions, because, you know, you can only upgrade so many different things.
[01:02.20]However, that being said, it's still a crazy amount of fun, and it's just extremely intense, especially in the Man Up game type.
[01:09.70]And as I said, I do want to kind of distinguish the difference between what I've learned.
[01:13.96]I just want to tell you guys what I've learned since the last video about the Man Up game mode.
[01:18.64]So, the way it works is, if you buy a Tour of Duty ticket, you can get into the Man Up game mode, which is going to be the harder difficulty mode, basically.
[01:28.69]What you buy when you buy that $1 ticket is one mission, or at least one win, out of the six missions that are available in the Tour of Duty.
[01:37.53]So, as I probably mentioned in the last video, if you do lose a mission, you do get to keep your ticket and use it again later.
[01:44.78]However, whenever you do win, what I thought it was, I thought that if you bought the ticket and you get into the game mode, then you automatically get one of the new cosmetic items for winning a mission in the Man Up game mode.
[01:55.27]However, that is not the case.
[01:56.19]You actually have to complete a tour of duty to get, quote-unquote,
[01:59.53]Rare item an item that is specifically available only in this update now to complete a full tour of duty you have to play six missions and that's six unique missions and That's going to cost six tickets and therefore six dollars So you basically have to pay six bucks in order to get one of the bot killer weapons and of those you can either get a regular bot killer or a gold bot killer weapon and what those are are replacements for the stock items
[02:25.16]of the nine classes, so you could get a bot killer wrench for the engineer, or you could get a rocket launcher for the soldier, so on and so forth, and those are strange, and they will count your kills, but like I said, there is a gold version that is infinitely more rare, and if you get one of those, you might consider taking it and selling it for lots of money.
[02:43.76]But that's, shh, that'll just be our little secret.
[02:46.74]But you are guaranteed to get a Bot Killer weapon.
[02:49.94]Or item, I guess I should say.
[02:51.88]For completing the full tour of the ODEON, completing all six missions.
[02:55.53]And for each individual mission you complete, you are guaranteed to get a random item.
[03:00.81]But it's not guaranteed to be anything special.
[03:02.77]It's probably just going to be a normal item.
[03:05.21]So, knowing that, it does change things up considerably.
[03:08.40]Because at first, like I said, I thought you'd only have to buy one ticket to get one of the new cosmetic items.
[03:13.00]Which I believe...
[03:14.40]It's really silly of me to think in hindsight because, let's be honest, when was one of these Valve items, especially a cosmetic item, only a buck?
[03:22.34]Never.
[03:22.70]However, that being said, after the first time I played the Man Up game type, and we won, I actually found a hat, and I found a hat that was released in this update that came with the Man vs. Machine game mode, and I believe it was for the Spy, I don't remember the name of it, but I was very pleased with that, and for having only paid $1 for a ticket, getting a hat, that's a really good deal by Valve standards.
[03:45.18]So I'm not going to complain too much about the price tag because I did get my money's worth technically already and then some.
[03:52.64]But I have been having fun with this.
[03:54.06]The thing about this is whenever you buy a ticket, you have to have your Steam wallet filled with money.
[04:00.08]So you're going to have to buy five bucks anyways.
[04:02.30]So you've basically already bought five tickets if you want to.
[04:05.48]Obviously, you can save the extra money for other things.
[04:08.36]Maybe if you want to buy a specific item.
[04:10.34]However, you basically have to buy five out of the six missions already.
[04:13.85]If you want to play the sixth one, you've got to fork over another $5.
[04:16.67]So I don't really agree with that.
[04:18.45]I've never, ever liked the Microsoft way of doing things where you have to pay for certain increments of money, especially on this PC platform.
[04:26.92]I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to buy a certain amount of money without having to buy $5 increments.
[04:34.38]So, not real happy about that.
[04:35.82]However, I don't really have a problem with paying a buck for the extra game mode just to have the experience.
[04:41.69]This is not something I would want to play with random people.
[04:45.25]I've tried playing some community servers with randoms and they always end up with three heavies in them.
[04:50.41]I don't know why, but it seems like heavy is the most popular class and half the people that are playing out of the six
[04:56.05]are playing as heavies.
[04:56.87]I don't know why that is.
[04:58.89]But yeah, playing with friends as I'm doing in this game mode, and again, if you want to check out any of the people that are in this video, the links to their YouTube channels are in the description of this video for your viewing pleasure.
[05:10.00]However, yes, like I said, playing with friends and actually being able to coordinate, especially in the man-up game mode, so intense, so much fun, and I do have the final wave here to show you here in just a second.
[05:20.37]We failed the final wave the first time, and that's what you just saw us do here, but we come back, and we come out victorious.
[05:25.47]So anyways guys, I hope you enjoyed this video.
[05:27.17]If you have any questions about the Man Up game mode, please feel free to ask in the comments below.
[05:31.49]If I can't answer, someone can because you are all lovely people out there.
[05:36.44]Again, thank you guys very much for watching.
[05:38.26]My name is Etalyx and enjoy the live commentary from here.
[05:54.13]You're hitting my sentry does nothing orb.
[05:57.84]Here come the tanks.
[05:59.28]Why are the gates up again?
[06:01.00]Okay, whatever.
[06:02.34]Everybody's targeting what?
[06:04.40]You guys target left side, I'll go right with my sentry or something stupid like that.
[06:10.56]Hey Bergen, just out of curiosity, what are your medic points in?
[06:17.64]Um...
[06:18.30]All the upgrades, pretty much, just the Medi Gun upgrades, you know?
[06:22.78]And one Buzz.
[06:24.16]That's it.
[06:25.22]I was just so lazily standing there doing that, I got myself run over by the tank.
[06:28.50]You got squashed.
[06:29.30]I love how Boo's just like, sitting on top of it.
[06:34.24]Oh, I got squashed!
[06:35.02]No, I got spied, okay.
[06:37.96]That scared me.
[06:38.67]I'm not there, so if you see me, it's not me.
[06:41.61]He's around.
[06:42.53]If you see anybody come by our center, orbs, shoot them.
[06:46.04]That tank needs to be taken care of.
[06:49.52]I'm attacking it now.
[06:51.06]Seriously, that tank.
[06:52.22]That tank.
[06:53.56]It's going down.
[06:54.78]That tank.
[06:55.78]It has a lot of HP.
[06:57.87]Are you mocking me again?
[07:00.73]You were mocking me, so I was mocking you mocking me.
[07:03.33]I wasn't mocking you.
[07:04.67]Don't even use it.
[07:06.45]We'll kill it without it.
[07:10.13]We were mocking everything.
[07:12.67]Everything.
[07:15.14]Hey, it's dead.
[07:17.62]I got killed by a reflection pyro.
[07:20.85]You were killed by the... Oh, is that a reflection?
[07:23.39]Yeah, you killed me.
[07:25.55]He got killed by looking at his own reflection.
[07:28.51]Alright, we gotta get a... I'm that deadly handsome.
[07:36.74]I don't want to buy back in.
[07:37.66]I don't want to waste money.
[07:38.38]Is he going now?
[07:39.08]Yep.
[07:39.38]Got him.
[07:39.90]Nice.
[07:41.08]Yeah, buddy.
[07:42.20]Alright, now we have to... This is where we got messed up last time.
[07:46.48]Trigger these Ubers as fast as you can.
[07:48.18]Yeah, I'm literally going to stand behind where he lands and just spray the medics.
[07:52.86]Yeah, as soon as you do, they'll get away from you because the heavy will just slowly... Yeah, I got an Uber canteen.
[07:58.44]Oh, cool.
[07:58.72]Alright.
[07:59.54]Yeah, I got one Uber canteen as well.
[08:01.30]I just can't remember how to use them.
[08:02.56]Here is a... Where is it?
[08:04.30]Left side?
[08:05.53]Yep.
[08:06.11]That was a terrible shoot.

[08:18.43]I was like, but I'll be... Oh, my God.
[08:21.98]What do we do?
[08:22.62]Panic.
[08:23.62]Panic.
[08:25.04]Alright, we got the medic.
[08:26.60]How did you even begin to lag?
[08:28.70]Hey, another heavy behind you.
[08:31.62]Oh, I'm running.
[08:33.61]Oh, I have a sentry buster.
[08:35.77]This is no good, man.
[08:37.77]We can't get the sentry buster this time.
[08:39.27]Spies, spies.
[08:41.33]Get up there, get up there, get up there.
[08:43.37]Trying to kill the medics.
[08:44.73]Oh, I have a spy.
[08:46.39]Oh no, I just got backstabbed by three guys.
[08:48.45]All this guy's medics are down.
[08:50.85]Alright, that guy's down.
[08:51.91]That guy's down.
[08:54.31]Oh, I got backstabbed.
[08:55.97]I'm looking for the spies.
[08:58.09]I don't see them.
[08:58.81]Oh, it's MLC_St3alth.
[09:00.53]There's one.
[09:02.65]Did he go through the teleporter?
[09:04.31]Are you a hacker, Boo?
[09:05.47]No.
[09:05.95]Are you hacking right now?
[09:08.09]Just reset, reset, reset.
[09:09.29]Are you hacking right now?
[09:10.90]Here we go.
[09:13.13]Yeah, this is the tough part.
[09:14.09]No, this is the easy part.
[09:15.27]Let's do this.
[09:15.89]Trigger all the Medigubas.
[09:17.41]Yeah.
[09:17.61]Not one at a time, just get them all.
[09:19.01]The what?
[09:19.57]Left side or right side?
[09:20.80]Both.
[09:20.94]Get inside.
[09:23.08]Oh my god!
[09:23.82]I got the trigger one.
[09:25.76]Medics slowed me.
[09:28.16]I'm coming out the other side of the tower.
[09:29.58]Shoot the medics.
[09:30.82]Only shoot the medics.
[09:31.98]We have to get them to activate the rubers.
[09:34.46]There we go.
[09:35.30]Dead.
[09:36.02]Oh, that actually worked.
[09:37.08]Oh, that actually worked.
[09:37.98]I actually remembered to use mine.
[09:39.90]Forget about the tanks.
[09:40.76]We can take the tanks out later.
[09:43.66]There's two tanks.
[09:44.62]Oh my god.
[09:45.26]I got one of the tanks.
[09:46.66]Those can go down.
[09:47.78]One of the heavies is pushed up by the way.
[09:49.42]I'm fighting him now.
[09:50.42]Alright, the other one's almost dead.
[09:51.50]The other one's almost dead.
[09:52.70]I'm turning around to start getting the tanks.
[09:54.10]Yeah, I'm hitting another crit.
[09:57.06]Let's do it.
[09:58.50]I'm almost out of ammo.
[09:59.10]It's all good.
[10:01.14]Get ammo after you.
[10:02.20]Oh, the heavy's at the bomb.
[10:03.08]He's gonna kill me.
[10:03.82]He's almost dead.
[10:05.92]Alright, this heavy's almost dead.
[10:07.10]This heavy's almost dead.
[10:07.90]Kill him.
[10:08.56]Oh, is he not dead?
[10:10.73]He's gonna get it.
[10:11.33]He's going to get it.
[10:12.01]He's gonna die.
[10:12.47]He's gonna die.
[10:14.73]Guys, we got him.
[10:15.41]We got him.
[10:16.27]The tanks are the big deal now.
[10:17.97]Now I'll just kill the tanks.
[10:20.97]Got him.
[10:22.35]Yay!
[10:23.75]This tank needs to seriously get a life.
[10:26.15]It's so tanky.
[10:27.55]Oh, the other one.
[10:28.15]The other one's got full health.
[10:29.33]They're like crossing paths right now.
[10:30.77]Okay, don't worry about it.
[10:31.77]We got the other one.
[10:33.57]Light him up.
[10:34.39]Get the money so we can buy back in.
[10:36.13]Just light this guy up.
[10:37.07]Watch spies.
[10:37.80]They're our spies.
[10:38.48]They will ruin this whole thing.
[10:39.50]I killed one.
[10:41.94]Drop down.
[10:42.40]Drop down.
[10:44.62]There's one more.
[10:45.20]There's one more.
[10:47.70]They're the ones that move around so crazy.
[10:51.59]Hey, that's me.
[10:51.93]That's not me.
[10:52.37]You're not me.
[10:53.97]We got it.
[10:54.47]We got it.
[10:54.83]We got it.
[10:55.27]It's all good.
[10:55.93]We got it.
[10:56.21]We got it.
[10:57.01]Got it.
[10:57.99]Victory.
[10:59.45]Yeah, buddy.
[11:00.81]Credit rating A. Missed some gold, but it's okay.
[11:05.75]Was that gold?
[11:06.37]What are you talking about?
[11:08.48]Ha, I got a Phlegesnayer!
[11:09.56]Oh, great!
[11:10.45]Oh, Forza Nature?
[11:11.31]Come on.
[11:12.19]Wait, I didn't get st- oh, that's because I've already completed this, that's why.
[11:14.95]Oh, I found a lot of stuff.
[11:16.19]Power, something- So you- but you didn't have to pay a ticket to play it, so that's cool.
[11:20.24]Aha!
