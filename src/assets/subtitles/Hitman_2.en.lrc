[00:01.83]Hey.
[00:01.91]What's going on, buddy?
[00:06.36]How you doing?
[00:13.66]I am doing good.
[00:14.84]Apologize for starting on time today.
[00:20.32]I was going to start 20 minutes ago, but I got a text message that I had to respond to.
[00:27.53]I had to talk to somebody.
[00:30.79]really quickly and What do you have it?
[00:34.43]How do you know here we are?
[00:38.48]Well Eddie that's texting for 20 minutes No, I text and I had to do something Because of the text that I received You understand I'm saying here, okay Give me a second.
[00:55.83]I'm gonna play hitman 2 tonight
[00:58.32]I'm excited for this game because the first one was my game of the year.
[01:02.88]When it came out a couple years ago.
[01:05.50]And I am so stoked to play this game.
[01:09.64]I'm so excited for it.
[01:10.66]It's just going to be hard.
[01:15.82]Sorry, it's going to be a ton of fun.
[01:19.12]As you can tell, I'm fucking excited for it.
[01:22.26]So, see you guys in a minute.
[01:24.56]Get a water.
[01:25.48]Beerby.
[02:12.98]Another Labo stream.
[02:14.44]No.
[02:15.52]No.
[02:17.34]No.
[02:19.87]Kim and I built the jet with the plane.
[02:24.99]And then I have the submarine that's going to sit there for a rainy day.
[02:28.16]Day!
[02:30.18]So, you might see the submarine built six months from now.
[02:40.10]You never actually go.
[02:40.94]You're just sitting there silently watching chat like a creep.
[02:43.38]That's correct.
[02:45.08]That's a 100% correct statement.
[02:48.95]Anytime I tell you guys, oh, I'll be right back, and grab yourself some drink, I hit the mute button and I stand here.
[02:54.07]I just sit here.
[02:55.85]And... Uh-oh.
[02:59.76]Here it comes.
[03:02.78]Okay, there we go.
[03:03.48]Yeah, I just sit here and stare.
[03:09.86]First joke of the night.
[03:13.72]It's weird because, like, you guys don't know what I'm doing.
[03:17.09]I could be doing anything when I hit that mute button.
[03:19.97]But typically, I'll sit there and make sure my tweet went through, and then I'll stare at chat for a little bit while, you know, because it takes a while for people to realize that there's a stream going on, or if they're watching somebody else, maybe they stay there, maybe they see the notification, and... Get over there, quick!
[03:37.30]But you know maybe like 10 minutes.
[03:39.62]I like to kind of just just relax you know You know you could be you could be watching anyone on Twitch I don't listen you see that jet that J 985 fucking pop-up window in the top right corner, and you go like this You can't you do you miss it like four times cuz you're like I can't I have to go now No, I'm just kidding
[04:07.55]That's what I just did.
[04:20.12]You think way too highly of yourself.
[04:21.98]I'm just kidding.
[04:22.80]That's a joke.
[04:24.38]If you're new to the stream, we go back and forth, Bo.
[04:29.61]If you're new to the stream, welcome to one of the top 1000 Twitch broadcasters.
[04:39.80]No self-esteem allowed.
[04:41.65]Now, just enough.
[04:43.53]Just enough.
[04:44.75]Right?
[04:47.25]Because all my self-esteem is about to go out the window when I can't find the guy I need to talk to in the first tutorial in the game.
[04:53.93]You know what I mean?
[04:55.35]Oh, man.
[04:55.75]Like, top 1,000.
[04:56.33]Twitch streamer.
[04:57.25]Okay.
[04:57.80]Welcome.
[04:58.30]Okay, guys.
[04:59.02]How are you?
[04:59.68]I'm pretty great.
[05:01.44]And then I'm going to miss a blip.
[05:02.98]And I'm going to drive by the same blip like three times.
[05:06.38]So, like...
[05:09.78]That's probably... And then I'll be like... All the confidence just falls off the cliff.
[05:18.58]No.
[05:18.94]All jokes aside, welcome.
[05:20.54]Have a great day.
[05:22.51]That's not the button I wanted to press, but still, whatever.
[05:33.82]I have a stream deck now, and it's actually pretty interesting.
[05:37.52]Because I can do so much weird shit with it.
[05:39.00]There we go.
[05:42.56]Oh, he's really scruffy.
[05:46.95]He's wearing a wig.
[05:47.87]Oh, and by the way, I was able to pause it right at the opening cutscene.
[05:51.55]So, take a look at that.
[05:56.90]Wait, I gotta make sure everyone's ready.
[05:58.36]Everybody ready?
[06:04.95]No, not yet.
[06:05.51]Okay.
[06:06.59]I'll wait till you're ready.
[06:11.26]Were you ready?
[06:13.64]You guys ready?
[06:16.69]Okay.
[06:19.05]Agent 47 and his handler Diana Burnwood are the world's top assassins working for the ICA.
[06:25.94]When all of their recent missions turn out to be contracts for a shared client, things take an unexpected turn.
[06:34.32]All their targets have been operatives in an invisible organization known as Providence.
[06:40.20]Providence has infiltrated the highest echelons of power and secretly owns our world.
[06:47.95]The Shadow Client wages a silent war against them.
[06:51.90]And so the constant, Providence's enigmatic controller, seeks Diana out.
[06:57.68]His request, track down and eliminate the Shadow Client.
[07:02.17]In return, he offers something irresistible.
[07:04.91]The truth of 47's lost origins.
[07:07.97]We're gonna know where he's from.
[07:09.05]We know that the man they hunt is 47's childhood friend.
[07:13.39]He's gonna be really... Normal, right?
[07:16.75]He remembers everything.
[07:19.15]Oh, Agent 47's past that we did not know before.
[07:23.77]No, he's... He's from Ontario.
[07:28.95]Whatever.
[07:42.66]Quebec, actually, but okay.
[07:46.55]Ooh, this looks good.
[07:47.57]This looks slick.
[07:50.39]Alright.
[07:50.85]I need to, like, relax.
[07:53.31]I've been looking forward to this game for a long time, though.
[07:55.25]Like, the first one was so fun.
[08:00.94]This actually, like, runs beautifully.
[08:03.00]Hold on a second.
[08:03.78]I need to change this.
[08:12.35]Mouse and keyboard we're gonna take it's always so high that fucking DPI Wait wait even hold on it.
[08:19.62]Can I press the DPI button?
[08:20.84]Oh?
[08:22.85]Oh, I can.
[08:25.03]No hostile presence.
[08:26.25]Understood.
[08:27.49]Alma Reynard's house is just up the beach.
[08:30.07]Our intel indicates that she and her team are laying low, most likely planning the militia's next strike.
[08:35.28]Reynard is one of the Shadow Client's top lieutenants, and yet she's not a target.
[08:39.70]Not yet, anyway.
[08:41.25]She's no doubt high on our client's list.
[08:44.47]I can't play in the water?
[08:48.83]I don't want to go, like, splash around in the water.
[08:52.23]Search the house for intel on the shadow client.
[08:57.47]Bones.
[08:58.67]Dinosaur bones.
[09:03.07]47, those are... Trekkie Otopto bones.
[09:06.82]A land animal.
[09:10.24]From the Jurassic period.
[09:14.84]This game looks amazing.
[09:16.64]Uh, like, I'll say it again.
[09:17.68]Press C to sneak.
[09:20.26]Uh, the first Hitman was my favorite game to come out a couple years ago, so.
[09:23.96]You have to imagine that it's just, it's just more.
[09:26.74]Alright, so we gotta sneak into the, like, penthouse.
[09:31.95]I'm gonna get intel.
[09:32.99]Is this, is this how the UI is?
[09:34.65]Alright, I'm just gonna sneak around on the grass.
[09:41.03]And if there's a brick, I'm throwing a brick through the window.
[09:46.45]Control is the instinct.
[09:48.51]Okay, we've got a diaper up there, a diaper over there.
[09:51.59]It depends on which diaper I want to use.
[09:55.05]Okay.
[10:02.64]I mean, that's a security camera.
[10:04.00]I definitely don't want to walk in front of the security camera.
[10:11.83]Why go in here and, like, rob this guy or kill this guy or whatever?
[10:15.30]I could just come here every day and just watch whatever movie he's watching.
[10:20.15]I could bring, like, my whole family out here.
[10:22.97]And we could just, like, call his house and, like, inception shit into his head.
[10:29.20]I mean, if we wanted to watch, like, Infinity War tonight, bring, like, the whole family out here, just, like, call them.
[10:34.24]Be like, oh, yeah, sir, this is your credit card company.
[10:37.14]We just wanted to make sure that we declined that purchase that you made of the rental of Infinity War, one of the top movies of 2018.
[10:44.57]I just want to make sure, and highly rated, too.
[10:50.09]Do you want to accept those charges?
[10:51.47]Are you sitting down tonight?
[10:52.49]Are you in front of your couch?
[10:54.63]Oh, fuck, dude, I want to accept those charges.
[10:56.24]And then we, like, all sit down and we just watch it.
[11:07.90]Okay.
[11:08.50]Well, here's... I guess I can stop crouching.
[11:12.24]Equip your pistol.
[11:14.89]Uh, I, and then enter.
[11:19.65]Sorry, I had to.
[11:20.31]Alright, destroy camera.
[11:24.55]I don't... I don't wanna!
[11:30.48]What?
[11:33.92]There we go.
[11:34.62]It's broken.
[11:39.21]Ooh, that feels clean.
[11:44.38]That didn't destroy it?
[11:45.10]Got it.
[11:45.78]Mm-hmm.
[11:46.18]Oh, but I... I... But I can't... I don't want to do that.
[12:07.07]Oh, I can't.
[12:17.35]God, come on!
[12:20.23]God!
[12:21.69]I got it.
[12:21.95]I think that should be it.
[12:32.98]All right, that's the last camera, I think, right?
[12:36.77]Got that one.
[12:40.47]Okay.
[12:40.69]There's a couple of... Oh, actually, there's one over here.
[12:43.84]Oh, and I already saw them.
[12:50.36]I'm so excited to play this game.
[12:53.00]Can you tell?
[12:53.48]Hey, can you tell, guys?
[12:57.34]There's one over there, too.
[12:58.36]Can I get that long range?
[12:59.46]Check this.
[13:01.90]Two... I'm so good at everything.
[13:12.34]At everything.
[13:13.65]Okay, we got... We got a screwdriver.
[13:23.45]Just in case we need it.
[13:27.36]So good at... That's me.
[13:33.94]That's me!
[13:37.77]Okay.
[13:40.42]Yeah, guys, I'm so good at everything, even though I can't even determine what my own reflection is.
[13:44.49]Alright, search the house for intel.
[13:49.07]Holstering.
[13:49.49]Holster an item.
[13:52.31]Sorry, I need to look up for intel.
[14:07.09]Oh, you gotta love that noise.
[14:14.30]They thought of everything.
[14:15.10]Alright, uh, open door.
[14:21.12]Gee.
[14:22.42]Uh, I can't.
[14:22.90]I'll actually have to go key.
[14:24.16]Use the key.
[14:27.24]Missing.
[14:29.26]Okay.
[14:29.80]I need a key.
[14:32.45]Uh, we just need to keep looking around here for intel.
[14:39.87]Smash the door.
[14:42.01]Wait a minute.
[14:42.49]Intel.
[14:46.18]Short circuit with the run over your garage.
[14:50.48]You take your garage door opener.
[14:53.06]There we go.
[14:57.73]What's with all this?
[15:01.39]What is aiming down here?
[15:03.85]Is it a disco ball or is this something I need to pay attention to?
[15:16.14]Shit.
[15:23.80]Alright.
[15:33.06]Gee.
[15:35.41]Uh-oh.
[15:37.01]Male and female.
[15:39.67]Early thirties.
[15:41.59]Executed.
[15:42.33]I see them.
[15:42.91]Poor bastards.
[15:45.97]Looks like Raynard's grisly handiwork, all right.
[15:48.43]She was never shy about collateral damage.
[15:50.61]The owners?
[15:51.25]Don't think so.
[15:52.47]The house is registered to a non-existing environmental NGO.
[15:56.24]This feels more like identity theft.
[15:58.56]Like you, Raynard is known to use disguises.
[16:02.04]So wait, I'm dealing with another 47?
[16:04.40]Nothing we can do for these people now.
[16:07.31]Okay.
[16:08.53]I got Intel.
[16:09.55]F1.
[16:10.63]Murder victims.
[16:11.17]A deceased couple of people have been discovered in the garage and the cause of death appears to be execution.
[16:17.36]She just told us all these.
[16:18.82]She just told us everything.
[16:20.58]Alright.
[16:20.86]Search the house for Intel.
[16:22.32]We've got some stuff to look at here.
[16:24.36]I don't like G. Masks.
[16:31.05]Ropes.
[16:32.82]Chloroform?
[16:33.38]I think I'll test it to see if it works.
[16:36.15]Diana.
[16:36.35]If I stop talking, I drank too much chloroform.
[17:08.07]Tell my son his trust fund password is 1111.
[17:10.87]Why am I doing all this?
[17:15.18]These all work.
[17:29.02]I'm just a maintenance guy testing QA.
[17:33.19]I can't unlock.
[17:33.87]Why am I holding a car battery?
[17:38.16]I don't know, I need a lockpick.
[17:41.98]We got, uh, expired can of spaghetti sauce.
[17:46.00]I need a can of spaghetti sauce, people.
[17:47.80]This might be the best game ever.
[17:48.86]You know what I'm saying?
[17:51.27]Like, all I want is to be able to spaghetti sauce people in the head.
[17:55.45]Like, that's all I want.
[17:56.57]It's the only thing I've ever wanted in a video game, and apparently it's here.
[18:07.98]Do I need this?
[18:14.32]Ooh, what's on TV today?
[18:19.04]We got, looks like a window blinds.
[18:25.07]Oh, yeah, turn them off.
[18:26.61]Make sure nobody can see in here.
[18:30.11]Piano.
[18:32.87]Close them all.
[18:41.41]Oh, this is the other side of the window.
[18:44.25]What do we got?
[18:45.07]Intel?
[18:48.94]Some phone ringing?
[18:49.84]Bathroom ventilation system.
[18:51.32]That's Ari, the repair guy.
[19:12.25]What a weird sink.
[19:15.99]Oh god, it actually works!
[19:18.86]What?
[19:20.28]Holy shit, your sink sucks!
[19:24.80]Can you come and fix the sink instead?
[19:26.96]Because I just turned my water on and within five seconds my whole bathroom flooded.
[19:32.86]The design of that sink is not good.
[19:34.44]What about the shower?
[19:36.98]Is it actually gonna fill the whole place?
[19:41.36]Let's do it!
[19:45.51]What the f- Hold on, so you can, you can like, throw a toaster and you- Okay, that's fucking ridiculous.
[20:14.88]47, I'm trying to find Intel.
[20:17.17]Diana.
[20:18.39]Uh, Intel on the criminal.
[20:21.15]I don't know that throwing a car battery while standing in water is a bad idea.
[20:27.81]Eat shit!
[20:40.87]Wait, did somebody just say frame rate?
[20:46.58]Are we losing frames?
[20:52.59]It's fine?
[20:53.13]It's alright?
[20:54.27]Yeah, it should be somewhere close to 60.
[20:58.61]Alright, let's go.
[21:01.07]Well, that's an indication of what's to come.
[21:03.86]This already is my favorite game of the year.
[21:08.44]That's all it took.
[21:09.60]Seriously.
[21:19.13]No, I can't.
[21:20.29]I can't just do this.
[21:23.71]No, I can't.
[21:25.50]I have to get out of here.
[21:29.08]Can I get in the bathtub and turn the water on?
[21:39.47]I don't think I can.
[21:48.94]No, I can't get it now.
[21:53.52]Got it.
[21:53.76]I just have to sneak and get it.
[21:56.15]Is there anything else?
[22:02.31]The bathroom ventilation system, he said, was fucked up, right?
[22:09.51]I need this key.
[22:10.29]I gotta go in his bedroom.
[22:13.73]Nice house.
[22:17.68]Curt I can just can I hide in here is this okay?

[22:48.82]Glass of whiskey.
[22:55.40]I don't even know whose this is.
[23:03.13]Oh my god.
[23:03.99]Really?
[23:04.57]Like... This... There's so many things.
[23:11.21]It's like a dead rising.
[23:13.57]The amount of random things you can just pick up here.
[23:16.75]Okay, did I, uh, miss anything?
[23:18.47]Let's go this way.
[23:19.19]Alright, there's a computer over there.
[23:33.50]Wait, camera.
[23:34.92]No, I already got it.
[23:41.19]I can't get through this door.
[23:42.09]Alright, I need to get to that computer.
[23:49.72]Alright, this way.
[23:54.70]I didn't look over this way, though.
[23:56.27]Let's check the other side.
[23:59.31]There is a bench over here.
[24:00.41]I don't know if this has anything to do with intel, but I have it.
[24:03.07]What's this?
[24:07.44]Coin.
[24:12.10]Why is this all the way out here?
[24:18.60]Blend in.
[24:19.22]Alright, I'm sorry guys, but like... If somebody happens to be swimming in the ocean right now, I'm sorry.
[24:27.02]You know what I'm saying?
[24:29.74]But it's gonna ha- I'm sorry.
[24:35.05]I just electrocuted everybody that was in the ocean.
[24:47.30]I'm playing Hitman, though.
[24:48.08]I had to test it.
[24:48.82]What's this?
[24:49.97]Fire poker.
[24:50.81]Oh, more tools to fucking go crazy with upstairs.
[24:54.01]Wait.
[24:54.77]Yeah.
[24:56.69]Think of all the fish.
[24:58.15]That's like 600 million fish that I just fried right there.
[25:02.67]See, you can see even the bird, like all the fish coming out.
[25:05.67]They're like getting fried and flying up in the air.
[25:09.75]See, those are fish that are fucking flying out of the ocean because the electricity is just everywhere.
[25:20.63]Okay.
[25:25.65]This looks like something I can do here.
[25:30.23]Maybe not.
[25:33.35]What about with this?
[25:37.24]Can I, like, break this thing?
[25:41.08]Poison.
[25:41.80]The panic room ventilation.
[25:46.44]Uh.
[25:52.87]I'm just fucking up this guy's whole house.
[25:55.25]I'm poisoning every inch of this guy's house.
[25:59.77]I'm poisoning... Hey, your panic room, your whiskey.
[26:02.93]Where is this person?
[26:03.79]Alright, that's... Okay, panic room ventilation.
[26:06.27]This is the bathroom up here.
[26:13.19]This is solar panels.
[26:14.59]Okay.
[26:20.01]So the real question is, how do I get to the room with the computer?
[26:26.66]Because this brings me back here.
[26:28.03]I need to get in there.
[26:28.71]I think it wasn't already in there.
[26:32.37]Unlock the door.
[26:33.23]Come on!
[26:40.97]Can't pick the lock.
[26:42.49]Crowbar.
[26:43.95]Can't break it open.
[26:52.40]Where's my quick weapon wheel?
[26:56.52]Go into the panic room and breathe heavily.
[27:05.16]God damn it!
[27:08.51]Do I not... I don't... I thought I had a crowbar.
[27:12.19]I did before.
[27:12.93]Where is it?
[27:15.05]No, it's a lead pipe.
[27:21.95]Wrench.
[27:22.71]Screwdriver.
[27:24.64]I can't unlock it with the screwdriver.
[27:27.78]Did I lock myself out of the house?
[27:37.41]Did I lock myself out of the house?
[27:42.53]Did I press a button to lock the doors?
[27:59.76]Alright, well I was already here.
[28:01.21]I like went through this whole house already.
[28:08.77]Go to the garage?
[28:09.89]What the hell is their garage?
[28:18.21]How did I do this?
[28:27.32]What do you mean the garage?
[28:30.50]What's in the garage?
[28:40.13]Yeah, I know the moment of the dead people, but did I, like, fuck up the whole house?
[28:43.55]I can't unlock this either.
[28:57.02]Stop!
[28:57.48]Stop it!
[29:28.58]Alright, computer.
[29:31.94]This thing's gonna drive me crazy.
[29:33.86]I'm gonna go upstairs.
[29:39.48]Stop!
[29:42.71]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[29:45.07]47.
[29:45.79]That computer.
[29:46.79]Got the computer!
[29:47.41]Can't access it.
[29:51.19]Encrypted.
[29:51.97]Hmm.
[29:54.25]Assuming there's a key, Reynard wouldn't just leave it lying around.
[29:59.76]wait according to the floor plan the room you're in should be a lot bigger okay might be a concealed space behind the wall check for hidden panels 47 she's still talking out there alexa alexa I'd like to stop alexa play season one of house md
[30:38.63]Got it.
[30:44.14]Panic room.
[30:44.70]Uh-oh.
[30:45.80]Uh-oh.
[30:46.22]Wait.
[30:46.54]Hold on.
[30:47.30]This is the panic room.
[30:48.24]Should I not be in there?
[30:48.92]Alright, I'm ready.
[31:16.91]Nicely done, 47.
[31:18.28]Password dongle.
[31:18.98]Should allow you to move more freely.
[31:21.42]Here we go.
[31:21.98]For the office computer, no doubt.
[31:27.22]What about this one?
[31:30.00]Okay.
[31:30.62]See?
[31:30.80]I unlocked the shortcut.
[31:36.58]Kidnapping plan.
[31:37.54]Hmm.
[31:38.92]Appears Reynard's cell is launching another strike.
[31:41.35]Hmm.
[31:41.63]There's a sewer box of a residential area in Wellington.
[31:44.89]Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
[31:47.00]Our priority is the shadow client.
[31:49.74]I got it.
[31:50.00]I got it!
[31:50.42]I got it!
[31:50.88]I got it!
[31:52.18]Everybody just relax.
[31:56.33]Okay.
[31:57.05]Back up to the... I'm sorry, Alexa.
[32:12.29]But you made me do this.
[32:14.99]Where are you, Alexa?
[32:22.67]Thank God.
[32:23.21]Until they work the bugs out.
[32:38.20]They'll send me another one.
[32:40.04]I'm detecting movement up the road.
[32:41.91]A motorcade, possibly Raynaud's.
[32:43.85]Uploading the data.
[32:44.95]Hold on.
[32:46.29]I'm receiving it now.
[32:49.94]Nothing on the shadow client or the other cells.
[32:52.60]No names, no aliases.
[32:54.79]I doubt she even knows whom she's working for.
[32:57.97]Wait, here's something.
[32:59.77]A message from Robert Knox of Kronstadt Industries.
[33:03.15]And by the sound of it, he's a Providence operative.
[33:06.13]A defector.
[33:07.15]Well, well, well.
[33:08.53]Client won't like this one bit.
[33:10.33]And you can't wait to tell him.
[33:12.92]They're back.
[33:14.22]Multiple hostiles.
[33:15.99]I see them.
[33:16.91]Damn.
[33:17.75]Here we go.
[33:18.11]Okay, we've got all we're going to get.
[33:19.87]Go to stage two, 47.
[33:21.16]Stage two.
[33:21.72]Eliminate Raynard, and preferably without raising suspicion.
[33:25.28]One step ahead of the shadow.
[33:26.28]What about the grenade I threw in his living room?
[33:27.76]Let's keep it that way.
[33:29.52]Oh.
[33:32.16]This guy walks in.
[33:33.34]Alexa!
[33:34.12]Alexa two and Alexa three!
[33:35.42]I would never end.
[33:36.48]What a snob.
[33:37.54]Where's my trio of Alexas?
[33:38.86]I even missed out on the action.
[33:41.44]How?
[34:10.61]Somebody drag me out into the street and shoot me.
[34:17.38]I'm equalizing, guys.
[34:18.47]I want to make it like it's like John Wick 3.
[34:20.43]That's going to happen.
[34:26.60]There's going to be a huge fight.
[34:28.22]And John Wick is going to run out of bullets.
[34:30.94]And then the antagonist is going to run out of bullets.
[34:34.58]And then there's going to be a pipe on the ground and a butter knife right next to him.
[34:39.04]He's at a restaurant.
[34:40.54]And he's going to be like, Hey, you out?
[34:44.29]Yeah, I'm out.
[34:45.81]Huh.
[34:46.89]What do you say we do this the old-fashioned way?
[34:49.95]And he's going to throw the butter knife over like this.
[34:51.59]Welcome home, Alma.
[34:54.29]And get out.
[34:56.09]How do you throw harder?
[34:59.51]How do you?
[35:00.13]I want to throw it harder.
[35:03.45]Hold on.
[35:22.44]Come on.
[35:23.22]How am I supposed to... Oh, that don't work.
[35:29.57]Why?
[35:31.63]How do I get out of here?
[35:37.43]Alright, I'm in.
[35:49.24]Steal one of their cars?
[35:54.95]Silent takedown for that.
[36:06.29]What?
[36:07.33]Oh.
[36:10.19]This isn't... This is not the Thief Simulator.
[36:28.40]I'm currently concealed.
[36:30.00]What's with that blur?
[36:35.42]The game really does not want me to be over here.
[36:39.72]That was a really good silent explosion.
[36:48.71]Body found.
[36:49.45]Oh no.
[36:50.05]Come on.
[36:50.51]I got silent kill.
[36:56.41]What's this blurry shit?
[36:57.50]Am I game broken?
[36:59.02]How do I, like... Oh.
[37:07.67]Oh, fuck!
[37:09.11]Oh, I shouldn't have done that!
[37:10.11]I didn't even need to do that!
[37:18.79]This is so far away.
[37:20.29]I went the wrong way.
[37:27.83]I skipped this whole mission.
[37:31.69]Well, I did it.
[37:32.37]Wait till this guy turns around.
[37:46.12]Should I squeak?
[37:46.58]Should I kill this guy with the squeaky toy?
[38:00.16]Can I squeak it?
[38:00.76]I wish I could just press a button and have it go like... Oh man, my game's actually kind of running like shit.
[38:17.91]Alright, squeaky toy assassin kill here.
[38:24.73]Squeaky toy kill.
[38:26.65]I'm gonna stuff it down his throat.
[38:29.75]See?
[38:30.03]It's in his mouth.
[38:43.46]Still got it in my hands.
[38:44.16]I'm gonna have to, like, turn something off.
[38:50.86]A distraction.
[38:51.50]Okay.
[38:51.78]I can do that.
[38:59.56]No, I can't wait loud squeaky toys a lot The thing just exploded shit All right, hold on let me like turn off a couple of settings I don't think I can
[39:32.47]Super sampling level of detail texture quality 1080 let's turn that off ambient occlusion How's that do that feels a lot better I
[39:54.98]Holy shit.
[39:55.52]This game with ambient occlusion on just kills my frames.
[40:00.46]Well, never mind.
[40:01.00]It's back.
[40:01.34]Alright, here we go.
[40:04.81]I'm just going to throw a coin.
[40:07.65]Will a coin make a loud noise?
[40:08.71]No, hold on a minute.
[40:10.39]I'm not doing something over there.
[40:13.67]No, watch this.
[40:14.29]Okay, here we go.
[40:19.51]Got one.
[40:22.15]He looked like he was about to look.
[40:23.83]What if I just go over here?
[40:30.02]Will they see me if I do this?
[40:55.92]Guys
[41:27.17]Alright, well, there it is.
[41:28.13]Flawless.
[41:42.17]They said make a loud distraction.
[41:50.09]Excellent work, 47.
[41:52.99]Ooh.
[41:53.71]Suit only.
[41:54.43]Mastermind.
[41:55.79]Don't tread on me.
[41:56.65]Discover Hawk's Bay.
[41:59.31]So that's interesting.
[41:59.99]So you could do... Okay, there's a lot of things I could do there besides roll a grenade in front of her.
[42:22.21]Alright, well... That was funny.
[42:30.80]That was fun.
[42:33.50]I'm streaming it at 60 FPS right now, and playing at 60 FPS might not be a good idea.
[42:40.91]I might have to tone it down a little.
[42:46.89]Got one star on the tutorial.
[42:48.35]Yeah, because I threw a grenade three times in somebody's living room.
[43:07.93]So here's the interesting thing about numbering your games and redoing them and redoing them and making new sequels and sequels and sequels.
[43:14.77]30 years from now, how many Hitman 2s do you think they'll be?
[43:27.19]The Board of Practical People, 47.
[43:29.95]A blank check is hard to turn down.
[43:31.45]What if there are like four Hitman 2s?
[43:33.05]Besides, the Shadow Client's war on Providence is causing a global panic.
[43:37.44]Someone will need to stop the militia.
[43:40.16]Might as well be us.
[43:41.85]And the man on the train?
[43:49.30]Taking a contract for personal gain is against ICA regulations.
[43:52.92]She's supposed to be talking?
[43:53.88]Sodas would have been proud.
[43:55.88]Oh no, I thought I had a broken game.
[43:57.83]47, whatever next?
[43:59.45]Crying at the movies?
[44:01.11]Why are you doing this?
[44:03.67]I know what it's like to have everything taken from you.
[44:07.05]I know what it's like to lose.
[44:09.65]He claims to know about your past, your childhood, your memories, everything Altmire stole from you.
[44:15.86]And you trust him?
[44:18.07]I mean, I'm not going to deduct points for that.
[44:20.87]I mean, honestly, in a game like this, does it really matter if it's like a cinematic kind of comic book style cinematic?
[44:44.38]Like, that's a lot of development time.
[44:45.76]That's a lot of animation.
[44:47.32]Like, spend the money on, like, throwing bricks at people.
[44:49.48]You know what I mean?
[44:49.90]Like, they did.
[44:57.01]We can see you haven't completed your training.
[44:58.47]We recommend that you complete advanced agent training before continuing the story.
[45:02.41]Okay, fine.
[45:03.62]I'll do my homework.
[45:07.54]I also have to walk around a little bit and make sure that I can stream this at 60.
[45:18.57]But it's just the training from the first game.
[45:22.45]Oh, is it really?
[45:24.13]Oh, damn.
[45:24.77]It is.
[45:26.83]But let me just make sure it wasn't just... Was it just that level?
[45:29.47]I think so.
[45:30.67]Because this is running fine.
[45:31.59]Okay, how do I leave?
[45:49.58]What?
[45:52.70]What the hell is going on right now?
[45:55.26]Just Hitman and then Hitman 2.
[45:57.22]Is it the... Do they have the other game in here?
[46:05.61]Really?
[46:07.63]Hold on a second.
[46:09.23]So you get the first... All the episodes from the first game, the second game, and then this other little campaign for the same price.
[46:23.56]Oh, okay.
[46:24.14]If you own it already.
[46:25.24]Okay.
[46:25.70]Alright.
[46:26.28]Like, I was gonna say, holy shit.
[46:30.37]Alright, so we got blank check, and then here's the first mission.
[46:32.90]Finish line.
[46:37.26]Good afternoon, 47.
[46:39.17]Your destination is the annual Global Innovation Motor Race in Miami, Florida.
[46:43.19]That would have been crazy.
[46:44.75]After analyzing the data from Reynard's computer, the case is clear.
[46:49.05]The Providence defectors are Robert and Sierra Knox, head of robotics developer Kronstadt Industries.
[46:56.68]A visionary inventor and technological innovator, Robert Knox has spearheaded Kronstadt Industries to the bleeding edge of technological development.
[47:06.19]Where's the whole grain?
[47:07.58]His equally powerful P.L.
[47:09.74]is not only a financial wizard, but also a fiercely competitive race car driver, with a fiery temper to match.
[47:18.37]Cronstadt enjoys enormous popularity with global consumers.
[47:22.43]However, few are aware that the company is also one of the world's leading suppliers of next-gen military tech.
[47:32.03]Last year, despotic ruler Jin Po employed prototype Kronstadt drones against peaceful civilian protesters in the now infamous Tanyan Valley incident.
[47:42.28]And although it has yet to be proven, there is little doubt that the Knox's personally broke the deal, making them complicit in a war crime.
[47:53.92]Mission active.
[48:31.31]So let's take a look Objectives let's just see targets here in ox Eliminate using any method and you can wear any disguise kill conditions and Intel we don't really have much She suffers from inferiority complex in relation to her father I
[48:51.80]Highly invested in the Kronstadt racing team and is the company's lead driver.
[48:55.93]Okay.
[48:56.81]So this is the driver.
[48:58.65]And then we got Robert Knox.
[49:00.37]Any method, any disguise.
[49:06.25]Let's see.
[49:06.65]Let's pick out one.
[49:07.87]Technical skills and reputation catch the attention of a powerful group of people.
[49:11.62]With the recent CEO killings, Knox feels the ground burning beneath his feet and so makes another bold life decision.
[49:16.44]He contacts the terrorists through a dark web connection and offers them a deal.
[49:20.69]And you spare him to get the digital keys to his Warcraft account.
[49:27.35]All right.
[49:27.71]Planning.
[49:28.17]Smuggled item.
[49:29.66]What do we got?
[49:32.16]Complete additional challenges to unlock.
[49:33.84]So this is the only place I can put it.
[49:35.14]And I don't... Do I have anything?
[49:38.40]What do I want to put in here?
[49:39.92]Pistols.
[49:43.72]I mean... The Pale Duck?
[49:48.32]There's an explosive duck in the game.
[49:50.20]Suit.
[49:50.52]Florida suit.
[49:51.22]Alright, yeah.
[49:55.95]And start of the event.
[49:56.81]I'm just going to do it the way that it's supposed to be done.
[50:00.49]So.
[50:01.43]Difficulty.
[50:02.07]Professional.
[50:04.79]Assassination is serious business.
[50:05.97]You plan, you execute, you escape, and your handler is right there giving you the guidance you need to succeed.
[50:10.59]Unlimited saves.
[50:11.56]All mission story guides available.
[50:12.92]Surveillance cameras active.
[50:14.40]Cameras alert guards of illegal activity.
[50:16.06]Spotted combat is challenging but fair.
[50:22.57]That's fine.
[50:23.91]Not doing Master.
[50:25.45]The missions in Hitman can be solved in countless ways.
[50:27.29]One approach is to uncover some of the many mission stories and follow them through.
[50:30.76]When you uncover a mission story, you will have an opportunity to get help and guidance.
[50:34.18]Since this is your first time in Miami, you may choose to have a guide active from the get-go.
[50:41.96]I don't think I need to do that.
[50:46.92]No, it's uncovered.
[50:47.62]I don't want a guide.
[50:58.64]If this is how the other game worked, you kind of stumble upon objectives and intel and you can choose to act on it or not, right?
[51:06.52]You kind of just have to walk around and look at stuff.
[51:15.61]This is a great intro to like a real estate infomercial.
[51:19.13]The innovation race is on its last day and it is down to the wire.
[51:24.95]thousands of eager fans are gathered for the final laps of this unexpectedly close race sierra knox is expertly piloting her red cronstadt car her father robert knox roams the nearby expo building where cronstadt is showcasing its new prototype car the cronstadt rk mark iii has seen fierce competition from the chinese kowloon heavy industry's new racer
[51:52.57]Can I drive?
[51:52.87]There's like endless amounts of things I want to do here.
[51:56.19]This is just a CEO race?
[52:25.79]Oh, man.
[52:33.57]Eliminate Sierra Knox, eliminate Robert Knox.
[52:37.45]What are you doing, October?
[52:39.34]What's the matter?
[52:40.36]Okay, so... I mean, I see the guy in the mascot suit.
[52:54.01]I'm outta here!
[53:07.83]Who was that?
[53:08.33]I don't know.
[53:11.01]Don't ever hand me a pantslet again!
[53:12.42]Alright, hold on.
[53:15.18]Hold on, what's the matter?
[53:21.72]No, don't load that, just replay.
[53:30.93]Here, please go throw away this card.
[53:33.91]Yeah, I know, I understand it's like... Just, you know what, have a big sign with all your info on it, right?
[53:40.29]People hand out pamphlets and... How do I skip this?
[53:43.25]There you go.
[53:44.27]Like, people hand out pamphlets and... Oh, here's this, take this!
[53:48.35]No, just stand next to a giant sign.
[53:50.71]And have it say... Add a funny Snapchat filter if you take a picture in front of the sign!
[53:56.86]Pamphlets, people just throw them away.
[53:59.77]All right, what do we got here?
[54:01.19]Wire.
[54:01.49]So, the global innovation

[59:25.23]How could I not do the Mario Kart character?
[59:28.23]I need to follow this guy around.
[59:39.76]He's all the way over there.
[59:42.20]She's in the race, right?
[59:43.68]She's in the car.
[59:47.69]Hold on, I'm gonna save it.
[59:48.65]Let's start a new slot here, because I'm not starting from the very beginning.
[59:52.47]I just want to look.
[59:56.82]So, here's the track.
[59:58.46]Oh my god, this is so much.
[60:02.60]I want to get a good view.
[60:04.86]French fries, hamburgers.
[60:16.18]How can I not do the Mario Kart character?
[60:18.06]I know.
[60:19.62]How much more is there?
[60:20.56]There's outhouses.
[60:25.95]Can I actually go see the track?
[60:30.59]Her car's out there.
[60:32.81]Where does it come across?
[60:33.45]It comes across right here.

[60:36.51]Okay.
[60:44.08]Wow.
[60:45.24]Wow.
[60:47.24]Can I be a crazy fan and go run over there?
[60:50.10]This race sucks!
[61:09.03]I can't jump over that?
[61:11.73]I can see, hold on, there's a way over here.
[61:13.03]Oh, there's a... Hold on, let me, let's get a look.
[61:21.85]Police car down here.
[61:25.40]Exit.
[61:25.86]There's gotta be a way to get on the track, right?
[61:37.58]Okay, I'm not supposed to be in here.
[61:40.32]Alright.
[61:42.08]Parking?
[61:43.02]No, it's definitely not down here.
[61:44.30]It might be, though.
[61:47.51]Parking is the exit.
[61:48.43]No, let's try this way.
[61:54.31]I'm gonna have to sneak through here, up and around.
[62:04.59]Yeah, I'm gonna start over and do it again.
[62:06.27]I need to see if I can get over there.
[62:08.90]Oh, Jesus.
[62:16.52]No, I can't push him.
[62:21.06]Alright, I'm gonna put this on.
[62:26.08]No, there's no cars to push him into.
[62:33.79]Oh, they knew you were gonna try to do it, didn't they?
[62:36.53]They knew it.
[62:37.15]They put these barriers up here.
[62:39.99]Bastards!
[62:42.67]They put the barriers!
[62:50.51]Oh, that's too bad.
[62:53.46]Dump.
[62:53.86]No, I want to dump him.
[62:55.04]If I'm going to dump him, I'm dumping him, like, into the road.
[62:57.10]I might be able to do it.
[63:12.81]That's pretty close.
[63:14.07]If it gets done correctly.
[63:15.19]I see him wait for the wind...
[63:22.34]What a psycho.
[63:23.62]Alright.
[63:24.24]Can I throw him over though?
[63:25.16]That's the question.
[63:30.54]Nobody else on the other side here.
[63:32.06]There's people up there.
[63:35.37]Dump.
[63:35.77]Okay.
[63:42.15]Go wait for the next pass.
[63:46.93]And how about right... No.
[63:59.78]No.
[64:03.54]Maybe I can get down there from here.
[64:07.83]Holy shit, there he is.

[75:26.85]Does anybody actually walk down this path?
[75:32.81]They might not.
[75:39.16]Let's put him in the shadow over here.
[75:40.52]Oh, he's gonna wake up, too.
[75:44.18]What's in here?

[86:00.63]You claimed in your email to have somehow found internal reports that show Kronstadt's involvement in the Tungan Valley Massacre.
[86:06.33]Sounds about right.
[86:07.44]Let's be clear.
[86:08.48]You and I are having this meeting because my father doesn't need to know about this.
[86:11.74]It's just another undesired distraction.
[86:14.10]I don't care if the information is true or false.
[86:16.46]I don't care if it mentions moving money from the Nexus Project into Tungan Valley Damage Control, as you claimed in your correspondence.
[86:23.52]I do care about protecting my father, which...
[86:31.23]Let's be clear.
[86:32.23]You and I are having this meeting because my father doesn't need to know about this.
[86:35.51]It's just another undesired distraction.
[86:37.85]I don't care if the information is true or false.
[86:40.21]I don't care if it mentions moving money from the Nexus project into Tungan Valley Damage Control, as you claim in your correspondence.
[86:47.29]I do care about protecting my father, which is why you and I are... How do you think, Flavor Bird?

[87:27.15]No, get up!
[87:27.93]Easy as pie.
[87:57.23]Okay, we got one guy here.
[88:01.39]No, that's too loud.
[88:05.59]How do you think the flavored bird stays so healthy?
[88:15.17]Well, I broke his neck.
[88:16.27]I was trying to hit him.
[88:17.49]Okay.
[88:18.60]I'm staying with the bird the whole time.
[88:23.98]Can I dump him somewhere?
[88:25.18]No, I could dump him back here.
[88:28.12]I have to kill.
[88:28.58]I have to complete this whole thing as the Flavor Bird.
[88:38.01]Why did I kill this guy?
[88:38.93]I don't know.
[88:44.30]Jeez.
[88:45.98]Alright, did he turn into a genie?
[88:47.50]What the hell was that?
[88:59.63]Okay, now we can find Robert Knox, who is all the way over there.
[89:11.87]No, this is like an illegal item, but I think I'll be fine.
[89:14.97]Because I'm like a cartoon bird, and I Tom and Jerry people.
[89:21.71]Let's get it saved right here.
[89:33.81]What?
[89:36.67]Why did I put the bat away?
[89:40.87]I karate chopped him.
[89:44.16]I can't have the bat.
[89:46.28]I need to kill... Alright, I need to take the bat with me somehow.
[89:52.20]No, I can't even take the bat.
[89:54.80]What the hell?
[90:04.05]I gave the bat up already.
[90:06.69]What?
[90:17.70]Hey, here's a little extra vitamin C. Hey, what about you?
[90:23.22]Oh, don't run away from me.
[90:27.22]It's good for your bones.
[90:34.58]Whoa.
[90:34.92]Okay.
[90:35.38]All right.
[90:36.34]All right.
[91:08.47]I'm ruining childhoods.
[91:18.49]Okay, I need to put this away.
[91:20.97]I can't take the bat.
[91:22.17]Do it well, do it right.
[91:23.17]Oh, that was so satisfying.
[91:33.80]Just follow your nose!
[91:36.53]Speaking of your nose, it's about to be broken!
[91:41.84]I'm sorry, you know I had to do that.
[91:46.46]I had to make the follow your nose, it's about to be broken thing.
[91:59.47]Alright, let's go kill Robert.
[92:06.35]Follow your nose.
[92:07.79]Into your brain.
[92:08.75]I didn't do shit.
[92:12.63]Get out of here.
[92:13.15]Get out of here.
[92:13.57]Get out of here.
[92:13.97]Get out of here.
[92:14.52]Okay.
[92:17.10]So, Robert is all the way on the other side, isn't he?
[92:21.28]But I want the shovel, don't I?
[92:26.00]No, he's all the way down there.
[92:26.95]Alright, let's try to find an opportunity to go over that way.
[92:34.33]I can make it through here.
[92:37.92]Oh, hello there.
[92:38.50]Just take a seat.
[92:39.34]We're very busy right now.
[92:40.72]Take a seat.
[92:42.70]Oh, I'm sick.
[92:43.84]Is that an iPad?
[93:05.49]Ah, the mascot.
[93:06.69]It's not just a profession.
[93:09.10]Am I allowed to be back here?
[93:10.92]I mean, there's a doctor's schedule, but... You could have told me that.
[93:19.84]I'm fine.
[93:20.30]Okay.
[93:21.04]So... That's fine.
[93:25.80]I'm going to go through here.
[93:27.52]Medical staff only.
[93:28.44]Alright.
[93:31.30]I can't be over anywhere.
[93:32.52]I'm not allowed to be anywhere, is the bird.
[93:35.04]She did.
[93:35.48]She didn't make it clear enough.
[93:42.55]There's only room for one bird in this fucking town.
[93:48.36]Is this a threat?
[93:49.70]Is this some kind of threat?
[93:55.05]Are you threatening me?
[93:57.65]Everybody knows that blueberry is better than linen lime.
[94:01.37]You think you're gonna take my cereal from me?
[94:04.33]I can't imagine a more humiliating profession than being a mascot.
[94:15.44]God damn it.
[94:16.56]Alright, that's it.
[94:17.16]We're gonna go to Robert Knox.
[94:31.10]I gotta get this fucking costume off.
[94:32.90]It's taking me over.
[94:36.50]It's the costume.
[94:38.63]It was the goblin.
[94:39.37]Don't you understand?
[94:41.55]It wasn't me.
[94:42.75]I'm Jeremy.
[94:43.75]It was the goblin.
[94:51.20]Where's the flavor bird?
[94:52.90]So I can't, I have to go this way.
[94:55.20]What if we, okay, well he's coming down the alley here.
[94:57.78]Can we both go out as like a tandem show?
[95:00.30]I think maybe we can.
[95:07.09]If he's going to walk all the way down here, we can put on a show together.
[95:11.17]We have to do it together.
[95:15.41]Greetings, sir.
[95:24.37]He came up, like, right now, right?
[95:31.84]Hold Alt to slow walk.
[95:35.82]Alright, come on, man.

[95:58.08]We're going to go together.
[96:06.29]Can I do that walk too?
[96:12.91]I'm trying to walk slow.
[96:13.95]He won't walk slow.
[96:16.49]Holding alt.
[96:30.99]He's doing the Vince McMahon walk.
[96:37.39]We really are doing like the Chad thing.
[96:39.85]It's the two sides of the image right here.
[96:44.23]Alright, here we go.
[96:44.79]Let me get it.

[98:12.46]Where the hell was he?
[98:18.48]Flamingo parking.
[98:22.53]Where was his blip?
[98:24.73]Did he go down?
[98:29.07]Maybe I want, like, the actual map.
[98:32.63]Okay, he's in here.
[98:35.79]So he's in level two of the convention center.
[98:38.15]I'm over here.
[98:39.27]So if I go straight and then bang right.
[98:49.10]He left two hours ago.
[98:50.84]Okay, so if I go this way...
[98:56.48]I wonder if I can cross over here somewhere.
[98:59.08]Probably.
[99:04.72]Oh, no.
[99:04.96]Here's the race.
[99:05.62]Okay.
[99:05.80]I have to go down.

[99:12.92]I got a key!
[99:19.48]Oh, shit.

[100:51.92]And I'm definitely not going the right way from here, because this is gonna take me all the way across.
[100:55.02]Unless, no.

[102:52.31]Screwdriver.
[102:54.23]Shit.
[102:54.61]I'm not allowed to be here as the bird.
[102:56.65]I've committed to the bird, and I'm not gonna be able to do it as the bird.
[103:03.72]Unless I'm really sneaky.
[103:19.79]Alright, there's a guy there.
[103:21.55]Which way is he looking?
[103:36.44]Is he gonna notice that?
[103:37.12]Is somebody gonna notice that?
[103:40.25]This guy is in the perfect position to just stare at me.
[103:42.49]I need to throw something.
[103:44.41]I have two screwdrivers, so...
[103:50.36]Actually, I might not need to do that.
[103:59.16]Guy's sneaking around as a bird.
[104:04.26]He's over this way.
[104:05.41]Okay.
[104:09.67]Who's looking?
[104:10.27]Oh, I can.
[104:11.27]Right there.
[104:15.21]I can spot him!
[104:18.63]I did the mission.
[104:20.49]I completed it.
[104:22.13]I completed the mission.
[104:23.83]That's all that matters.
[104:49.32]I can't do this as the fucking bird.
[104:53.93]They didn't say I had to stay alive, you know what I'm saying?
[104:57.75]I just, I did it.
[104:58.49]That was the last mission ever, but at least I completed it.
[105:03.59]The only way the bird's gonna work is if I throw the knife at him.
[105:05.69]Bird or no balls.
[105:08.26]Fine.
[105:08.50]Hey, you!
[105:15.94]You can't be here!
[105:17.58]Who do you think you are?
[105:19.67]I can't- Oh!
[106:01.32]God damn it The amount of force to throw a screwdriver into somebody's head that deep that had to have been shot out of a cannon God I don't want to do it.
[106:13.33]I can't do this as the bird guys
[106:16.50]There's too much security.
[106:17.58]Oh my god, he's surrounded by people.
[106:43.99]What the fuck?
[106:45.57]What happened?
[106:58.38]Alright, this is my final attempt at the bird costume.
[107:04.88]I'm just gonna wait.
[107:06.30]I'll wait for him.
[107:15.08]I just gotta wait for him to go to the right place.
[107:20.09]Just get in here.
[107:21.89]Eventually, he's gonna come this way.
[107:24.37]Just hide behind the couch.
[107:27.85]What do I have?
[107:28.27]Crowbar.
[107:28.93]Rat poison.
[107:32.02]No.
[107:32.50]I'm just gonna push him.
[107:39.08]You've had to seen this.
[107:40.94]You walk into the room.
[107:41.82]You see fucking Birdo behind the couch.
[107:58.65]He's just hanging out over there.
[108:07.44]Holy fuck.
[108:11.36]Nevermind.
[108:15.53]That guy's on drugs.
[108:17.49]That's the only way you would say nevermind to that, is if you just did like three different kinds of drugs in the back room.
[108:27.18]That guy just freaked himself out.
[108:28.40]I had nothing to do with it.
[108:36.19]Where's he at?
[108:36.57]Alright, he's coming around.
[108:48.43]He wanted to avoid confrontation?
[108:54.50]There he is again.
[108:55.12]Try to, like, scare him again.
[109:03.22]Oh my god, I need to stop doing crack before work.
[109:14.09]See, he's looking at the wall and shit.
[109:15.58]That guy's... Here he comes.
[109:18.28]No, he's above me.
[109:25.40]When does he come down?
[109:27.06]Oh god, he's like... Wait.
[109:29.61]Could I?
[109:30.53]Is it possible?
[109:31.19]No.
[109:44.81]He's not coming down here.
[109:45.91]I gotta go up.
[110:09.45]Understood.
[110:10.21]Suspect is dressed up.
[110:11.87]Oh, man.
[110:13.16]Take his clothes.
[110:14.36]I can't.
[110:14.90]I have to do it as a bird.
[110:43.60]Oh my god, it's a grenade!
[110:49.16]Where am I?
[110:49.86]Alright, I'm doing it the normal way.
[110:54.07]I'm doing it the normal way.
[111:09.25]The normal way.
[111:10.55]I'm putting on the suit, and I'm gonna- the way that you're supposed to do this.
[111:15.20]No bird suit, but I'm gonna do this the correct way.
[111:19.56]No balls.
[111:20.36]I don't care.
[111:20.90]I don't care.
[111:22.86]Where is he?
[111:23.28]He's right there.
[111:26.37]What's wrong with me?
[111:28.49]Hey, stop!
[111:29.99]If you don't stop, there'll be trouble.
[111:31.73]That's an alternative getup.
[111:33.23]Fire at will.
[111:33.89]Okay, I'll bring him in.
[111:34.77]Come get your- Recorder!
[111:40.69]Both targets down.
[111:42.32]Well done, 47.
[111:43.88]Head for an exit and we'll speak again soon.
[111:46.72]Who is that?
[111:49.18]No!
[111:49.82]Shit!
[111:54.14]Just take off the fucking suit now.
[111:56.64]Put on this guy's security costume right now.
[112:04.29]It's not meant to be done like this.
[112:06.85]It's meant to be done like this.
[112:12.17]Oh, for the love of God.
[112:15.12]Where is he?
[112:18.74]What?! !
[112:39.49]It's harder without the costume.
[112:41.12]God damn it.
[112:45.90]Flamingo and gun.
[112:46.88]I don't want to just, like, shoot him.
[112:49.16]There's probably so many interesting things to do.
[112:52.50]Let me just go into, like, the... The room... Oh, God.
[112:56.26]Oh, this is the guy.
[112:57.90]Okay, this is the guy.
[112:58.40]We're taking this guy's costume.
[113:00.10]I'm bringing this guy into this room.
[113:04.00]So, come on in here.
[113:05.63]Yep.
[113:06.33]Like, the guy that's on acid.
[113:08.21]This way.
[113:13.17]He's right here.
[113:14.27]What's he doing?
[113:14.73]He's going upstairs.
[113:15.43]Alright, come on.
[113:15.99]Right here.
[113:20.97]Look at the knife in the ground.
[113:36.10]This fucking scientist.
[113:37.52]Whatever this guy is.
[113:44.27]Come on, somebody see the ghost and come in here.
[113:58.81]What?
[114:04.62]You can't climb up the pipe.
[114:05.72]You can climb down the pipe.
[114:06.88]Alright, trespassing.
[114:09.46]Come on.
[114:14.20]Get in here.
[114:15.74]Don't move.
[114:16.80]Okay, good.
[114:17.30]Hey, excuse me.
[114:29.72]What are you doing here?
[114:31.30]Oh, no!
[114:57.01]Put the bird costume on that guy.
[115:00.59]No.
[115:04.39]Where's he going?
[115:10.66]It's me.
[115:11.16]The guy that was just here.
[115:13.22]That's true.
[115:14.30]That's true.
[115:14.96]True.
[115:15.42]True.
[115:16.82]You've been recorded by a security camera.
[115:19.62]Searching.
[115:23.22]What do you mean hold up security guy?
[115:24.54]I'm on the same detail as you.
[115:27.00]What the fuck?
[115:28.12]What?
[115:28.82]I'm leaving.
[115:30.50]I'm leaving.
[115:30.90]What?
[115:31.10]I don't understand what I did.
[115:32.20]What happened?
[115:32.66]Oh.
[115:32.76]Not the right suit.
[115:33.39]Jesus.
[115:52.72]Shoot him!
[115:53.86]Why in the name of God are you superhuman?! !
[116:25.66]I hate myself.
[116:30.82]I didn't have the right security costume on.
[116:41.43]I didn't have the right outfit on.
[116:47.51]Hey, security guy.
[116:48.48]Hold on a second there, security guy.
[116:51.06]And of course he walks down here this time.
[116:55.70]Hey, I'm a security guy.
[116:58.06]I know, I walked too close to him.
[116:59.28]I know, don't worry.
[117:00.08]We're good.
[117:00.66]Everything's good.
[117:01.10]Everything's going to be just fine.
[117:07.56]Now I know I can't go up there.
[117:10.43]So we're going to blend in by... Okay.
[117:15.51]Am I allowed to go... That guy can see through my disguise.
[117:20.21]Oh god, there he is.
[117:23.43]Which way is he going?
[117:23.96]Straight?
[117:24.40]Straight?
[117:27.69]Coming this way.
[117:32.10]I'm peeing in the plant.
[117:38.23]That is Robert Knox.
[117:40.41]Genius inventor, black market's weapons dealer, and Providence defector.
[117:57.53]Well done 47 head for an exit and we'll speak again soon Get on I did it I did it dude
[118:29.13]Nice shot.
[118:30.45]You got the golden gun.
[118:31.61]Give me a break.
[118:33.61]I did it.
[118:35.45]Oh, no.
[118:38.13]I tried.
[118:38.83]It was right there.
[118:40.25]It was right there.
[118:45.30]I got on it.
[118:46.08]I just panicked a little.
[118:54.04]Oh, he's not going to come this way again.
[119:00.00]He dropped like a bag of bricks.
[119:01.77]Here he comes.
[119:43.24]Get down!
[119:44.04]What are you thinking?
[119:47.16]How do I get out of here?
[120:47.83]How do I get out of here?
[120:50.27]I'm like locked in here.
[121:02.19]I think I can cross from here.
[121:05.21]Yeah, cross from here and then... Maybe not.
[121:08.50]Right here.
[121:09.18]How do I get that way?
[121:18.35]I can go to that one.
[121:25.77]That was fun.
[121:26.73]Save, save, save.
[121:27.95]Yep, good, good, good call.
[121:30.73]And you said I wasn't going to do it as the bird.
[121:47.24]You guys were like, do it normal.
[121:49.52]Take the costume.
[121:50.34]Put on the regular costume.
[121:51.38]Don't do it as the bird.
[121:52.26]Don't.
[121:52.70]I'm like, I'm trying.
[121:53.66]Do it.
[122:07.47]I'm compromised, but I'm blending in.
[122:09.13]Why can't I... For the best.
[122:39.38]Congratulations, 47.
[122:41.02]You can now use that costume on every level.
[122:43.90]Then I have to play the whole game as the bird?
[122:51.25]Let's see.
[122:52.35]The Inventor.
[122:53.11]The Daredevil.
[122:54.03]Someone Could Hurt Themselves.
[122:55.43]Straight Shot.
[122:56.93]Mission Story.
[122:57.67]Pretty in Pink.
[122:58.33]Briefcase.
[122:59.09]Flamingo.
[123:00.71]Backdoor Engineering.
[123:01.69]Blackmail.
[123:03.09]Pink Menace.
[123:03.87]21,000 XP.
[123:06.39]Cool.
[123:19.79]Well, come on, I got level four!
[123:22.05]Mission rating, five!
[123:24.96]I'm about to be mission rating six, almost.
[123:27.76]Five and a half stars.
[123:35.02]That's what you get for kill... Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not going for perfect ratings here, I'm just trying to have fun.
[123:39.90]I'm probably going to get one star on every mission.
[123:46.58]new location mastery unlocked reached miami level four so each place has their own leveling system all loadouts are available okay gives you the options to use loadouts lost during the planning phase of this mission this can be used to bring items you've unlocked into the level an ica briefcase can be used to conceal illegal items a fish effective as a non-lethal blunt weapon
[124:14.02]Okay, that's cool.
[124:15.88]A set of lockpicks can be used to open locked doors.
[124:17.64]This one has the signature MK2 look.
[124:21.80]47 has slipped away from the main race event and starts near a beautiful dolphin fountain.
[124:25.64]He's wearing his normal civilian clothes.
[124:28.04]Opened up the marinara sauce.
[124:34.16]I thought this is another bird?
[124:37.82]Completing a mission is just the beginning.
[124:39.22]They are meant to be played more than once.
[124:40.62]There are multiple plots to uncover, characters to get to know, and unlocks to earn.
[124:44.68]To get the overall story of the finish line, we recommend that you complete the following mission stories.
[124:51.59]So, I did this one.
[124:54.51]Play mission story or skip.
[124:56.39]Oh, that's cool.
[125:00.56]That's awesome.
[125:02.38]Well, I'll come back to this.
[125:04.10]It's just Bird 2.
[125:13.52]Yeah, I'll skip it for now.
[125:14.84]I'll definitely go back and play it.
[125:19.68]Berlin.
[125:21.18]Can I do that?
[125:23.58]Shanghai.
[125:26.98]Montreal.
[125:29.53]We're bleeding operatives.
[125:31.15]Panic is spreading, and now we are axing our own?
[125:35.71]Knox was a traitor.
[125:38.35]He would have caused invulnerable damage.
[125:41.97]And he won't be the last.
[125:44.51]This is exactly what the enemy wants.
[125:45.93]You have to yell to each other.
[125:46.79]They can't hear you from across that way.
[125:48.20]And I have just the tool for the job.
[125:54.38]Right.
[125:55.60]The Burnwood woman.
[125:57.34]Eric Soders warned you about her, didn't he?
[125:59.70]That's a custom-made table.
[126:00.94]That's a whole tree.
[126:01.74]I can handle Miss Burnwood.
[126:04.67]Everyone hates power until you offer them some.
[126:08.55]And then you ought to know.
[126:10.13]Who is this weirdo?
[126:11.21]ICA speaks the enemy's language.
[126:14.52]We need them.
[126:16.04]And once we don't...
[126:18.38]we'll cross that bridge when we get there fact remains we are shadow boxing we need to know who we are up against that's like every I was getting to that that's every like young anime villain in every anime you've ever watched is lucas gray the late mr cobb's head of security cobb was ground zero first of our operatives to die
[126:42.83]I think it was 47.
[126:52.42]grasping at straws.
[126:54.52]Gray is a mercenary, a veteran of every backwater tragedy you've ever ignored on the 5 o'clock news.
[127:02.25]Chechnya, Sierra Leone, the list goes on.
[127:05.59]But before 89, nothing.
[127:09.44]No records of any kind.
[127:11.68]Event report.
[127:13.46]Where are the cut scenes?
[127:15.54]Plenty of spies went dark.
[127:17.22]After the curtain was lifted, I cast a very wide net.
[127:23.43]What's the in-between between cinematic and still image?
[127:27.35]What's it called?
[127:30.11]It's called something specific.
[127:31.01]Animatic?
[127:31.21]Animatic.
[127:31.47]Yeah.
[127:31.57]That's what it is.
[127:32.07]Oh, this is from the first game!
[127:51.40]This hearts and flowers crap will get us both killed.
[127:55.84]Can't you see?
[127:56.92]Your so-called friend is working for them now.
[128:00.32]He's not the man you knew.
[128:01.40]This is his fight too, Olivia.
[128:04.02]Even if he doesn't realize it.
[128:07.14]Like it or not, 47 is our last and only lead on the partners.
[128:12.05]So he wasn't even a bad guy?
[128:13.71]Was he a good guy the whole time?
[128:16.65]He's coming for us.
[128:18.39]And unlike you,
[128:20.51]All right.
[128:20.97]Cool, man.
[128:21.89]I have to pee again, honest to God.
[128:46.57]I don't know what's with the piss bullshit that I have.
[128:50.31]I'm just pissing.
[128:53.31]I wish I had a urinal right underneath me.
[128:56.81]I would just mute the mic, make sure the camera's not on, and just piss straight into the ground.
[129:01.68]I'll be right back.
[129:03.70]One more.
[129:04.08]I'm drinking coffee, too.
[129:05.08]That's why.
[129:05.46]Be right back.
[131:02.48]Okay.
[131:03.96]So, let's keep going.
[131:09.03]Uh, IO Interactive is not completely on their own with Warner Brothers.
[131:11.53]That was surprising, actually, when I saw the splash screen when I first turned it on.
[131:15.89]Warner Brothers.
[131:16.35]I was like, okay.
[131:20.71]So, it's funny.
[131:21.45]The Warner Brothers game division is doing pretty well recently.
[131:28.13]Although, I mean, I can't really say that for some of their movies.
[131:37.71]Is it still an Episodic game, or did they release it all at once?
[131:40.68]It is released all at once, I believe.
[131:45.48]Or am I wrong?
[131:48.28]No.
[131:48.66]It's here.
[131:54.27]Wait, is it Episodic?
[131:58.35]I thought they didn't do that this time.
[131:59.73]No, because I can't.
[132:00.27]Well, how would I be able to play this next mission?
[132:06.27]All at once.
[132:06.91]Same format as Season 1.
[132:07.67]That's good.
[132:08.09]I'm glad they did it like this.
[132:21.89]How's the frame rate been, by the way?
[132:23.39]Has it gotten more stable?
[132:24.17]They might be pushing it here.
[132:40.70]Clearly, Grey must have struck a deal with the Delgados.
[132:43.54]Consequently, if we can cripple the cartel, we can severely limit the malicious strike range.
[132:49.38]But to do so, we need to slay a three-headed serpent.
[132:53.68]Sociopathic cartel head Rico Delgado and his two closest lieutenants, PR guru Andrea Martinez and servant chemist Jorge Franco.
[133:04.41]With equal parts guts and guile, Rico Delgado runs a thriving billion-dollar criminal empire.
[133:10.73]The word is, the brutal and volatile cartel head is hell-bent on becoming the number one drug lord in the world.
[133:18.31]To achieve this, Martinez, a childhood friend of Delgado's, has been buttering up state leaders and decision makers, paving the way for an expansion of the Delgado logistics network.
[133:28.92]New candy recipe.
[133:29.70]Super Cocaine.
[133:30.58]Alright.
[133:30.91]Super Cocaine.
[133:52.54]Alright, so we need to get rid of Rico, Jorge, and Andrea.
[133:58.33]Andrea.
[134:01.57]All three of them.
[134:03.15]So, objectives.
[134:05.02]Planning.
[134:06.14]Concealed weapon.
[134:09.88]I mean, I like the chrome.
[134:13.32]Gear.
[134:16.75]Uh, aluminum travel briefcase, lockpick.
[134:19.68]I don't want the fiber wire.
[134:20.76]Give me the lockpick or the coins.
[134:24.34]Give me the lockpick.
[134:27.50]Lockpick and coins.
[134:30.56]Oh, fish, too.
[134:31.24]That's a good idea.
[134:32.16]Yeah, lockpick and fish.
[134:34.04]Casual tourist.
[134:35.62]That looks good.
[134:38.00]Starting at the village bus stop.
[134:43.29]I think I'm ready to go.
[134:44.11]Just gotta get rid of three heads of the snake.
[134:47.80]Three-headed serpent in... Santa.
[134:50.54]Wherever it was.
[134:51.86]Santa somewhere.
[134:57.80]Fish only.
[134:59.56]You can't kill people with a fish.
[135:02.36]Try turning down level of detail and turning up, uh...
[135:06.99]and the isotropic filtering and the isotropic filtering.
[135:10.95]I'll try.
[135:11.19]Turn down level of detail, turn up.
[135:27.15]Uh, Pop Tropica.
[135:27.87]If you're reading this and you're in a coma, wake up, we miss you.
[135:30.05]Wouldn't that be fucking weird?
[135:31.26]It is a rare occurrence to have all three cartel leaders present in the village at the same time.
[135:57.73]Alright.
[135:57.93]Where's the big tour bus?
[135:59.69]Whoa.
[135:59.81]I feel like this is gonna be big.
[136:02.03]Oh my goodness.
[136:02.37]Oh my lord.
[136:02.65]This is so much.
[136:28.44]All right, so let's go in here and let's turn down the level of detail.
[136:35.59]Let's put that to medium.
[136:38.71]And then let's turn up anti-osotropic filtering.
[136:45.45]Let's see.
[136:45.91]Do I need to restart for that?
[136:49.87]I don't think I do.
[136:58.97]That's pretty good.
[137:00.37]Although, who knows.
[137:00.97]Let's see how this is phrased.
[137:06.79]Alright, so we got hanging out guy over there.
[137:10.17]We have... three roads to go down.
[137:14.75]Actually, two.
[137:16.90]I don't know who's right in front of us, but we're gonna go into here.
[137:22.24]Turn shadows to low.
[137:23.90]And then turn that to 16.
[137:24.60]You sure?
[137:29.54]Shadows really don't just cause problems always.
[137:32.50]Especially for streaming.
[137:33.41]Alright, I'll do eight.
[137:36.19]That's all I'm doing.
[137:49.78]No, that is a compromise.
[137:54.24]I was going to do four and I turned it to eight.
[137:56.76]I doubled it.
[138:21.64]Alright.
[138:24.16]On a scale of 1 to 10, how spooky are you?
[138:26.06]Did he fall?
[138:26.88]Where did he fall down?
[138:27.54]Now they care.
[138:28.04]Now they care.
[138:28.58]He cares now.
[138:52.85]Welcome to Columbia, 47.
[139:15.62]The remote village of Santa Fortuna awaits you deep inside the Colombian rainforest.
[139:21.51]Alright, let's go.
[139:31.73]Can I do something with this guy?
[139:36.21]Oh man, I just really love that super cocaine.
[139:38.63]Can I throw fruit at people?
[139:42.65]Alright, let's find some intel.
[139:53.51]He's not there anymore, nevermind.
[140:02.18]I'm gonna store the apple.
[140:04.48]All right, so I got... Wait a minute.
[140:05.50]Wait a minute.
[140:05.90]Columbia.
[140:15.85]Mission story.
[140:16.58]Follow mission story guide.
[140:17.82]So there's a statue of himself.
[140:19.72]Hmm.
[140:19.84]Alright, let's try it.
[140:21.66]Can I knock the statue onto him?
[140:44.05]Sounds good.
[140:45.63]Sabotage the statue.
[140:50.29]There it is.
[140:53.08]So I gotta get up there and get to the statue.
[140:56.46]Sure.
[140:57.08]I was at the bar last night and the band were really good.
[141:00.20]Both with the music and the drinking.
[141:02.62]But my husband told me nobody's seen them since.
[141:05.77]So that's why Martinez and the Delgado Sicarios are running around like hellish chickens.
[141:12.87]Okay.
[141:18.19]Let's just... I have so many saved files.
[141:21.41]Where's it going to go here?
[141:23.17]That's the beginning of that one.
[141:24.05]This is the beginning of this one.
[141:31.22]It's mine, actually.
[141:32.74]Nope.
[141:33.14]You can't have it.
[141:33.76]All right.
[141:35.40]Town Plaza.
[141:35.88]There's the statue.
[141:36.80]There's the band.
[141:37.50]Getting ready.
[141:38.90]Should I blend in with the band?
[141:41.30]Oh my god, please tell me I can play, like, the guitar or the drums or something.
[141:47.99]I definitely can.
[141:49.83]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[141:58.09]Mission story revealing?
[141:58.99]No, it's up there.
[142:00.60]I don't know, man.
[142:06.52]I've been, like, smuggling...
[142:11.00]Littering is against the law, man.
[142:13.18]Okay, I'm in a hostile room.
[142:15.94]Compromised.
[142:17.02]I need to take this outfit off.
[142:41.21]Alright, I got a, uh... What did I just get?
[142:44.05]Drug smuggler man... A small note with some strange writing on it.
[142:46.65]It seems to detail some sort of plan to smuggle a small souvenir through customs and airports around the world.
[142:51.10]Apparently the souvenir is cast from pure cocaine and is to be limited back intact to Jorge Franco, the cartel's chief chemist, for some sort of unspecified taste test.
[143:01.19]The note also contains a recipe for what looks like to be very delicious hash brownies.
[143:06.23]Okay.
[143:13.18]That's him, right there.
[143:14.06]Hey, you there?
[143:14.70]Come in.
[143:14.92]The worst sound in the world.
[143:16.05]Don't touch that.
[143:16.83]On your knees.
[143:17.39]He's right there.
[143:19.65]I'm telling you, don't push me.
[143:20.73]Drop him.
[143:21.19]Final warning.
[143:21.99]Jesus!
[143:46.63]Well, I was just trying to explore.
[143:56.75]He's out of bullets?
[143:59.27]He was out of bullets.
[144:16.36]Alright.
[144:18.66]So, I'm going to go the other way, because that doesn't really wrap around very well.
[144:25.73]The guns feel actually pretty fun to shoot.
[144:28.01]So, I need to go up and around there.
[144:33.77]Am I allowed to go this way?
[144:35.58]Alright.
[144:42.40]I didn't put that there.
[144:43.20]Somebody else did.
[144:46.83]I'm just taking apricots.
[144:48.63]That's all I want.
[144:49.91]I don't want anything else besides apricots.
[144:51.45]I think I can get up there.
[145:01.36]This should take me around.
[145:02.30]I think.
[145:03.24]No, it doesn't.
[145:11.44]foundation.
[145:12.48]Hippo holding den.
[145:13.00]Alright, um... I probably can't go through here.
[145:15.98]Oh shit, I'll be right back.
[145:18.10]Alright, this is my opportunity.
[145:21.08]He's gonna come take like a piss over here and I'll be able to knock him out.
[145:45.32]Let's apricot this guy.
[145:46.46]Do you not see the apricot?
[146:00.40]Come get the... What are you doing?
[146:01.68]Apricot!
[146:05.88]Wow, how do you not understand this?
[146:14.33]Oh.
[146:16.28]No one ever taught you manners?
[146:52.29]Oh fuck.
[146:59.03]Why?
[146:59.21]Why did he spin around?
[147:05.88]I need to dump these guys somewhere.
[147:07.14]I could put them over here.
[147:15.12]Damn it.
[147:16.42]Come on.
[147:20.83]Into the woods.
[147:25.57]Anybody coming down?
[147:27.47]Oh!
[147:27.83]The statue!
[147:28.35]The statue!
[147:28.89]The statue!
[147:29.71]Push it on him!
[147:31.37]He's standing right there!
[147:33.69]Sabotage!
[147:34.19]I need a wrench!
[147:35.45]Oh god!
[147:36.09]I need a wrench!
[147:37.21]I need a wrench!
[147:41.68]Is there a wrench?
[147:48.12]You got a wrench over here?
[147:51.44]There's a shrine.
[147:56.29]I should have packed a wrench.
[148:10.50]If I were a wrench, where would I be?
[148:14.70]Down here?
[148:15.10]This looks like a little work area.
[148:22.54]Wrench.
[148:23.78]I just need a wrench.
[148:25.14]I don't care who has one.
[148:28.06]Wrench.
[148:30.90]You got a wrench over here?
[148:33.12]No.
[148:35.58]Poison the coffee glass.
[148:36.70]No, just give me a wrench.
[148:42.12]No, I just... I don't want to play any games.
[148:44.10]I just want a wrench.
[148:44.96]I don't want your... That is P-Power.
[148:50.87]Real name, Paul Powers.
[148:53.07]Celebrity tattoo artist and reality TV star.
[148:59.23]Who?
[149:11.36]Wrench.
[149:11.84]All I care about is a wrench, and I can't find one.
[149:13.88]Nothing.
[149:14.28]Well, I needed to have that beforehand.
[149:18.94]God damn it.
[149:32.10]Alright, where was Mr. Tattoo Artist guy?
[149:40.35]Hold on, let me check over here.
[149:41.41]Are they still over there talking at the statue?
[149:43.27]Probably not at this point.
[149:57.06]A wrench would be over here.
[150:06.07]Shit.
[150:06.39]Oh, I just woke that guy up.
[150:08.19]Restart with wrench.
[150:09.37]Not yet, not yet.
[150:10.77]I could probably go this way.
[150:13.07]I mean, I can unlock this.
[150:13.89]Anybody around?
[150:14.35]I mean, that guy is, but...
[150:36.35]Opportunity hasn't failed yet.
[150:37.53]Alright, come on.
[150:40.83]Material something.
[150:43.54]Damn it.
[150:45.90]I'm not on the rooftop right now.
[150:50.84]Is that a saw?
[150:52.32]No.
[150:54.10]Wow.
[150:56.03]This guy's like a brick worker.
[150:58.65]Brick workers don't use wrench.
[151:05.21]Of course there's a screwdriver up here.
[151:15.44]There's a crowbar.
[151:17.24]Crowbar, screwdriver.
[151:18.50]Where's the wrench?
[151:19.68]That's the place to hide.
[151:26.68]Let's keep checking over here.
[151:36.38]How may I be of assistance today?
[151:38.62]Do you have a wrench?
[151:41.44]Scissors.
[151:45.18]No wrenches.
[151:51.87]Why would a brick worker use a wrench?
[151:53.47]In case they needed to smash one.
[151:54.71]That's a baseball bat.
[152:08.77]This music is just blasting over here.
[152:15.53]Soda can?
[152:17.42]I'm just on the lookout for a wrench.
[152:19.96]I just need... I'm going in here.
[152:32.37]These people need to shut the music off.
[153:09.33]Oh, it's the drummer!
[153:17.29]Ah, turn it off!
[153:30.50]So I got the drummer's house key.
[153:38.39]Whoa, what's going on?
[153:39.27]Who's... Who the fuck... Is he dead?
[153:46.31]So, I'm now the drummer.
[153:54.54]Did I just take his clothes off?
[154:01.26]Turn off the stove.
[154:04.96]Hold on.
[154:05.72]Turn off stove.
[154:06.76]Is the stove on?
[154:09.30]I need a wrench for a gas leak.
[154:11.48]Turn the stove off.
[154:15.95]I don't even have enough to do a gas leak here.
[154:21.15]Is this guy actually awake?
[154:25.63]No, this dude's dead.
[154:26.95]This dude died in the vent.
[154:33.08]Hey you, do you see this?
[154:35.24]Who did it?
[154:39.28]How do I pull her in here?
[154:40.72]What does he want?
[154:43.70]What do you want?
[154:44.60]Just get in here.
[154:45.74]I didn't get to save it yet.
[154:47.88]Look.
[154:48.24]Follow me in here.
[154:48.82]Follow me this way.
[154:49.32]Follow me in here.

[154:51.16]Follow me.
[154:51.42]Follow me.
[154:51.70]Follow me.
[154:52.52]Thank you.
[155:16.54]Okay, we're now the band member.
[155:25.34]So, where is the band?
[155:27.63]Ah, there they are.
[155:29.37]Hey, they're waiting for me!
[155:34.43]Fellas, I'm here!
[155:37.11]Sorry, I was just dead.
[155:49.90]I think that we're practicing right now.
[155:53.88]Is there anything I can do over here, though?
[155:57.28]That statue.
[155:59.18]It's the statue.
[156:00.23]I need to get a wrench.
[156:12.69]There's no crowd.
[156:15.62]Yeah, because they're waiting for me to figure out how to find a wrench.
[156:25.10]Come on, right here, wrench, anything.
[156:28.88]Who the hell is this?
[156:31.32]Did I do this to this guy?
[156:32.20]Is that a wrench?
[156:58.25]Oh my... Let's go sabotage this thing and then we're gonna play with the band.
[157:10.59]He's waking up the band members?
[157:12.33]Did I just throw water in that guy's face?
[157:17.90]So I already took out these guys.
[157:18.96]People are gonna start waking up here in a minute.
[157:20.52]I gotta hurry up.
[157:30.87]Trespassing, yeah.
[157:33.27]I'm aware.
[157:33.75]Oh, fuck.
[157:36.06]Am I super trespassing too much, though?
[157:38.08]Alright, just go.
[157:43.74]Wait.
[157:52.47]What if it just toppled over?
[157:55.49]Alright, let's go.
[158:05.54]Yeah, here we go.
[158:06.54]I'm here, guys.
[158:16.10]There, play the drums.
[158:22.99]I'm pretty good at this.
[158:30.13]Wait, did she... What is she doing here?
[158:32.62]Is she gonna sing?
[158:43.54]Nothing's gonna fall No, that's the beginning
[159:12.74]Turn it up louder.
[159:13.70]Here, I'll turn it up louder.
[159:15.46]So, is she gonna sing really loud and it's gonna fall?
[159:24.45]Do I have to press a button?
[159:35.85]I hope they all start dancing and it shakes the ground.
[159:39.72]Turning to night here.
[160:04.58]She's gonna start going like... She's gonna hit a really high note, it's gonna fall.
[160:10.78]Um... What are we supposed to do?
[160:28.03]He's not coming down.
[160:33.63]He's not coming down.
[160:35.41]Hold on, I gotta do something.
[160:37.21]Which one is this one?
[160:40.10]This one.
[161:02.83]It's this one, right?
[161:06.18]Trying to shoot the pull cord.
[161:11.14]I... I... I know you have to wait, but I don't know.
[161:18.08]I figured maybe I didn't put something in place.
[161:25.19]Shooting the pull cord.
[161:27.17]Like that's what's holding it.
[161:31.08]Oh, I- do you pull the co- it's the- it's the big reveal, I get it, okay.
[161:42.67]You pull the thing, and oh, here's the big reveal!
[161:45.07]You can still see the statue though, it's a bad job.
[161:51.41]I figured that she was gonna hurry up and do it.
[161:52.93]So smart.
[162:14.30]I think you could push it if you're behind it.
[162:17.16]Well, that's why I got up, because it was, we're just kind of, there's no, it's just, we're just sitting there.
[162:23.66]To me, this is like a, the computer's waiting for you to do something moment.
[162:39.01]Play the drums as hard as you can until it falls.
[162:44.91]What's he doing over there?
[162:46.11]Well, it appears that Mr. Delgado is somewhat preoccupied.
[162:50.91]I'm sure it must be something important that is holding him back because this moment is very special to him.
[162:57.76]He was finding the body.
[162:59.20]You can leave for now.
[163:00.54]You'll be ready soon.
[163:02.44]No!
[163:02.86]No!
[163:03.08]Oh, no!
[163:04.69]No!
[163:04.89]No!
[163:13.51]Drop the statue!
[163:19.79]Whose body did I have to hide?
[163:21.86]What?
[163:22.66]Whose body did I have to hide?
[163:25.18]Man, he's very preoccupied finding bodies.
[163:34.31]Alright, where is he?
[163:38.33]There's a body.
[163:40.99]Pick up the fucking body!
[163:42.15]Where can I put these?
[163:43.14]Where do these go?
[163:44.70]I still hear drums.
[163:47.26]Who noticed a crime?
[164:10.70]Oh god damn it!
[164:13.82]I'm bringing them up.
[164:14.76]I'm bringing those guys up where the statue is.
[164:19.21]He found them.
[164:19.63]He looks at them both.
[164:21.79]I'm gonna drag them up to where the statue is.
[164:26.33]I still hear drums.
[164:48.61]Shit!
[164:56.37]No, don't touch foot!
[164:57.83]Oh my god, the wrong goddamn button!
[164:59.89]...and protect you, and care for you, as if you were our very own children.
[165:14.28]I'm currently trespassing.
[165:15.58]Oh my... That is Rico Delgado, head of the Delgado drug cartel.
[165:19.86]They're finding this body over here.
[165:21.94]They're finding this one.
[165:28.61]Aren't they?
[165:29.05]How are you finding that?
[165:35.09]He found the gun on the floor.
[165:36.65]Oh my lord.
[165:45.51]I gotta pick up- it's the guy that's- I gotta pick up the gun.
[165:51.19]I'm in a bad spot here though.
[166:17.53]What?
[166:18.35]Because he's like on the way over here right now.
[166:25.82]The guy in the bush is hidden.
[166:27.38]But is he though?
[166:35.02]Get out of the way.
[166:37.56]And then his gun is on the ground.
[166:40.26]Where's his gun?
[166:42.58]Just see the... Alright, gun.
[166:44.46]Here's his gun.
[166:48.17]Alright, I got his gun.
[166:48.95]Let's see if the other guy's hidden.
[166:51.86]That should be it, right?
[166:53.82]Here they come.
[166:54.22]Got it.
[166:55.40]What body are they finding?
[166:56.82]What body?
[166:58.02]That is Rico Delgado.
[166:59.68]Are they looking up here?
[167:02.42]How did you see that?
[167:04.12]And so, it is my immense pleasure to present to you Rico Delgado has been eliminated.
[167:13.44]Nicely done.
[167:15.70]Martinez is down.
[167:17.44]Good work.
[167:17.80]Go back to the other save.
[167:46.23]Like... Like before I got the wrench, I gotta go back like 15-20 minutes ago.
[167:56.25]I did it.
[167:59.06]That body just kept fucking me every time.
[168:08.68]I hide the body over the wall like the other guy.
[168:11.89]Alright, well, I'm gonna save this, like, here.
[168:15.67]Because if I don't give a shit anymore, I'm just gonna go.
[168:18.41]Alright, here we go.
[168:37.21]And then I'm going to take the gun on the way back.
[168:41.09]They're seeing this guy.
[168:49.88]Over the edge.
[168:50.26]Hurry up.
[168:50.64]Go.
[168:50.86]Hurry up.
[168:51.22]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[168:52.40]And pick up the gun on the way out.
[168:53.22]Go.
[168:58.04]You can go faster than that.
[168:59.82]Gun.
[169:02.01]Got it.
[169:06.73]I'm back.
[169:09.93]Sorry, I had to take a piss.
[169:20.00]Alright, sorry about that.
[169:23.14]Let's save it again.
[169:24.54]Here they come.
[169:32.95]Alright.
[169:35.52]Body not found.
[169:36.20]No, we're good.
[169:37.62]Here he comes.
[169:42.28]And so, it is my immense pleasure to present to you the benefactor of San Fortuna, the Lion of Bogota.
[169:53.82]The man who has taken it upon himself to destroy corruption and evil in this proud nation.
[170:00.17]We're going to get a two for one.
[170:01.41]The way that it was supposed to be played.
[170:03.45]Poetic justice coming up.
[170:06.82]Is he gonna tell us to stop playing?
[170:10.94]Or do we just play the whole time?
[170:14.44]Here we go.
[170:22.83]My dear, wonderful, grateful people of Santa Forca.
[170:27.95]It brings warmth to my heart to see you.
[170:30.40]What if it doesn't get the girl?
[170:31.50]She's standing off to the side.
[170:32.58]For years, decades, we have struggled against the oppressive forces of the outside world.
[170:39.64]For years, the Delgado cartel has been a bulldog against those who seek to do harm to you all.
[170:48.50]Today, we celebrate this struggle and the victories we have earned.
[170:54.98]Today, I grant you this symbol of freedom and rebellion.
[171:01.28]May it forever light your days and nights with hope of greatness.
[171:05.98]Here we go.
[171:06.30]And serve as something to aspire.
[171:08.68]Here we go.
[171:09.64]Do it.
[171:09.98]All of you can become as mealy one day.
[171:14.52]Now please, if the drummer could shoot the rope.
[171:19.60]Oh.
[171:20.28]I said drum roll, please.
[171:27.79]It didn't get her!
[171:28.65]It didn't get her!
[171:30.45]It didn't get her!
[171:31.63]It didn't get her!
[171:32.77]Oh no!
[171:35.41]How did it not get her?
[171:36.43]How?
[171:37.93]Is that possible?
[171:40.14]Are you kidding me?
[171:46.20]It only got him.
[171:49.04]Oh well.
[171:49.74]It's me.
[171:50.46]I'm in the square now.
[171:52.10]I don't see a puta mierda in here.
[172:01.89]Well, we did it.
[172:03.59]The way it was supposed to be done.
[172:04.49]I'm going to follow her around.
[172:08.74]Because it's... Right?
[172:09.52]Because it may add...
[172:29.81]I mean, that's kind of an odd thing to ask me at the moment.
[172:33.46]That's kind of... Yes, it is.
[172:37.40]Why did she just turn into a default NPC?
[172:43.22]She's about to fight somebody.
[172:49.87]She got her hands up.
[172:51.87]Why is she about to start boxing someone?
[173:00.87]Uh, she's... I think she might have gone totally crazy here.
[173:20.88]Just shoot her.
[173:21.70]No, no.
[173:22.12]It's gotta be something...
[173:30.71]She's just kind of hanging out here now.
[173:33.01]Should I play?
[173:33.59]Alright, play.
[173:34.91]Okay, sorry.
[174:20.62]Um... Mission story revealing itself.
[174:31.32]Franco, that's what we need to get.

[175:28.58]I need to get... She's just freaking me out here, man.
[175:32.36]Seriously.
[175:47.07]Can I get in through here?
[175:54.70]Yeah, there's always a side door.
[176:05.14]Okay.
[176:06.18]Where's your substance?
[176:08.25]Well, there it is.
[176:08.95]Tamper with broken cocaine souvenir.
[176:13.41]Poison.

[176:26.50]Well, I don't have either of those things.
[176:33.68]Shit.
[176:39.71]Well, let's go find glue and go find poison.
[176:44.27]I can put this down.
[176:46.53]Alright.
[176:55.20]Look at the glue and look at the poison.
[176:57.78]And there... There is an invisible wall here.
[177:00.24]I think there's supposed to be a dumpster here or something.
[177:05.70]It's weird.
[177:11.84]Alright.
[177:12.72]So, we got...
[177:14.51]This looks like somebody's just house.
[177:19.37]Let me take a look at the map.
[177:22.75]Mm-hmm.
[177:24.93]So we've got... There's our target here.
[177:28.51]Drummer's apartment.
[177:31.44]So many points of interest.
[177:33.02]Let's go... Let's just take a left.
[177:35.84]See where we end up.
[177:42.18]Well, here's medicine.
[177:45.77]Unlock door.
[177:46.75]We don't have anybody.
[177:47.94]Well, we got a guy actually looking right at me.
[177:51.50]Right there.

[179:14.50]Whoa.
[179:16.20]Turn around.
[179:19.30]It's not normal to throw stuff around.
[179:21.28]I'm going to have to knock them both out.
[179:24.10]All right, here we go.
[179:27.27]Let's see how it's going to go down here.
[179:28.33]I'm going to fish the first guy.
[179:30.69]This area has restricted.
[179:35.93]Oh, shit.
[179:36.43]Come on.
[179:42.80]Okay.

[179:54.61]Hello.
[179:57.99]Actually, let me see.
[179:59.11]Can I drop somebody here?
[180:00.01]Is there a ledge?
[180:02.45]Okay, there's a ledge there, but where does it go?
[180:04.57]Into the water.
[180:05.11]Good.
[180:08.80]Down from the water.
[180:13.76]Chad is now in fish only.

[180:34.96]Oh, oh, oh.
[180:36.82]Oh.
[180:36.96]Uh, well...
[180:45.84]I did not expect that.

[180:57.47]That's true.
[180:57.95]I don't know what that is.

[181:08.18]So this is like a lab down here.
[181:10.66]We'll get to see it again.
[181:18.61]What happens if I go down there?
[181:21.13]Will I get eaten by all the fishes too?
[181:27.54]Probably.
[181:27.96]Alright, we gotta clean this place up a little bit.

[199:13.62]This place is dangerous.
[199:22.66]And every body of water.
[199:26.00]Millions of them.

[200:01.08]She's still standing here.
[200:02.61]I think she's broken.
[200:04.97]I'm not sure that she's gonna do anything.
[200:10.85]I may as well just throw a coconut at her.
[200:12.18]Alright, where's he gonna go here?
[200:19.02]What the hell is that?
[200:21.15]Exposed wire?
[200:29.78]Oh, that would have been funny.
[200:30.82]Why aren't you listening to me?
[200:32.06]Are you deaf?
[200:37.54]I will call security.
[200:45.61]Hey, you look really stupid.
[200:48.25]Christ, I'm onto you.
[200:50.81]Can someone help me with this guy?
[200:53.13]Something really bad is happening.
[200:54.65]What the hell is wrong with you?
[201:04.53]Where the hell was it?
[201:05.21]18, 18.
[201:05.37]It's right here.
[201:08.43]Did I not save it?
[201:14.61]I have to get the glue again.
[201:20.84]18, 16, 18, 18.
[201:21.72]God damn it.
[201:27.96]I just unplugged his core.
[201:29.00]I just did the guy.
[201:29.96]I didn't know there was a guy sitting right there.
[201:32.06]Should have looked.
[201:34.32]Let's go get the glue.
[201:54.56]It flew out of my hand.
[201:56.26]Unconscious witness.
[201:57.40]Oh, shit.
[201:58.13]I gotta take care of her.
[202:21.79]She didn't see you?
[202:22.45]She's gonna turn around and find the body.
[202:26.23]She didn't need to see me do it.
[202:29.33]She will eventually figure it out.
[202:30.51]Okay.
[202:33.83]Now, let's go do what we need to do.
[202:36.53]We're good.
[202:37.43]Save the game.
[202:38.97]I'm gonna do it right... Right here.
[202:47.94]Alright.
[202:49.14]Let's go.
[202:53.11]I put him in a box.
[202:55.51]Well, I don't know.
[202:56.39]I feel like if I drag her all the way across... Imagine killing someone over a tube of superglue.
[203:08.39]I mean, that... Yeah.
[203:11.76]But this is not just a tube of superglue.
[203:13.10]This is a very secret... This is a secret mission.
[203:15.96]You know what I mean?
[203:17.50]That superglue means a shitload.
[203:21.20]Alright, so now let's go down here.
[203:29.15]She's still standing there.
[203:30.49]I know.
[203:31.05]Here's how this is going to end, guys.
[203:32.87]I'm certain of it.
[203:34.17]She's not going to move.
[203:34.85]Her AI is bugged out.
[203:36.21]And I'm going to have to throw a frying pan at her to head from the balcony and then run.
[203:39.56]Okay, so what does he do here?
[203:49.14]Hello.
[203:49.40]Hello.
[203:52.90]So he... Save it.
[204:02.93]So I gotta turn the water on, expose the wire.
[204:05.55]I could come through there, but does this guy get up?
[204:11.41]I'm gonna have to distract this guy.
[204:19.73]Oh, he's leaving.
[204:22.29]He's going to see me do this, though.
[204:29.95]Right?
[204:30.59]He's going to watch me do this.
[204:42.28]What?
[204:44.38]Hey, who is throwing stuff around?
[204:58.21]Alright, expose the wire, and then I'm gonna overflow the sink when he comes back.
[205:08.25]Turn on electrical outlet.
[205:25.22]Oh, fuck me.
[205:27.16]What the hell?
[205:29.44]No, give me this.
[205:44.31]He's about to come over here.
[205:45.21]Alright.
[205:45.79]Go check out that apricot.
[205:47.65]You didn't even see me do that, dude.
[205:51.57]You're one comment away from dying here, man.
[205:56.41]Yes!
[206:08.81]Oh my god, where is he?
[206:09.47]Am I gonna die?
[206:11.01]If I press this?

[206:38.83]Perfect this is exactly what I wanted to happen God I
[206:58.17]Oh, come on.
[207:02.02]Why did he walk in?
[207:03.46]That was so good.
[207:05.04]That was so perfect.
[207:07.22]I had it.
[207:08.02]Hold on, is that gonna happen again?
[207:44.08]So, hold on.
[207:44.74]I have to do... That's going to happen again, isn't it?
[207:48.54]So he leaves.
[207:54.01]I need the coins.
[207:55.11]Let's try this again.
[208:17.72]Okay.
[208:19.60]I'm ready.
[208:21.22]I'm ready for when he comes back.
[208:23.42]Let's save it here.
[208:38.88]Wait, what?
[208:49.08]Oh, it happens again.
[208:50.78]Okay, I want to see a good view of this.
[209:01.22]I just wanted to see it.
[209:02.74]We didn't get a good view last time.
[209:10.42]I'm just gonna go up and just snap the guy's neck in the upstairs.
[209:13.42]Why do all this? Why go all through this trouble?
[209:19.97]Why go through all this trouble?
[209:24.36]What am I doing?
[209:24.98]This guy's dead right now.
[209:31.58]Oh, no.
[209:32.80]Weed's almost gone now.
[209:35.73]That was a good pond.
[209:44.21]Oh, come on.
[209:46.35]Can you just go see whatnings what it was?
[209:48.04]Yeah, we'll do.
[209:51.98]That wasn't even the right guy.
[209:57.33]Oh my god, that wasn't even the right fucking guy.
[211:07.09]I know, it's off.
[211:09.23]I'm going to turn it on.
[211:09.87]Once this guy gets out of the way.
[211:11.19]He's going to mop this whole thing up.
[211:12.05]Did he mop up the whole thing?
[211:34.11]Hurry up and get in there.
[211:34.79]What if I... I'm going to body block him.
[211:42.63]What?
[211:43.35]Why did you do this?
[211:49.68]What the hell is that?
[211:52.20]Wait, I mean...
[212:03.53]I'm just going to go up and turn on the alarm clock.
[212:10.30]I did that because I restarted it.
[212:11.50]I'm trying to restart it.
[212:15.20]Alright, forget it.
[212:15.90]Upstairs.
[212:16.34]Alarm clock.
[212:17.16]Hey, come to your alarm clock.
[212:19.04]I could go in the room, but I'm just going to kill him.
[212:21.58]I'm so sick of this guy.
[212:27.93]Hey, maybe you should come to turn off your alarm clock.
[212:37.14]We're gonna put him.
[213:08.54]I have to steal the china.
[213:32.49]There's no china to steal here.
[213:39.30]Can I do this?
[213:52.24]Investigating distraction.
[213:56.88]What distraction?
[213:57.86]Oh, the alarm clock.

[214:28.24]Isn't that what this is?
[214:34.14]Play the Pink Panther theme.
[214:36.24]No.
[214:37.38]I thought those were swords.
[214:40.61]Hey, what's up?
[214:42.07]Smuggling cave discovered.
[214:45.06]Ah, you're expected.
[214:46.12]Have a seat.
[214:47.00]Franco's on his way.
[214:49.04]Okay.
[214:50.70]Franco is on the way.
[214:52.04]Have a seat.
[214:52.70]We've got... Hold on.
[214:54.42]Blend in.
[214:55.04]A submarine crew.
[214:59.36]Coke?
[215:03.65]I'll keep that for later.
[215:04.55]Okay.
[215:06.55]Quieres una menta?
[215:07.13]No.
[215:09.59]Oh, that guy's... Does that guy have a harpoon gun?
[215:22.64]What the hell is that?
[215:23.32]Alright, what else we got?
[215:26.02]I need a rat poison.
[215:27.90]What can I do with some of this stuff?
[215:30.50]Let's see.
[215:32.46]There is a wind-up toy, but I don't need to do that right now.
[215:41.21]Here he comes.
[215:41.69]Okay, uh, act natural.
[215:42.89]I gotta be careful.
[215:44.27]Um... Place the cocaine souvenir.
[215:50.37]Can I poison the cocaine?
[216:02.88]It already is poisoned.
[216:05.62]But extra poison, just to make sure it works.
[216:11.96]Hey, what's up?
[216:13.16]Okay.
[216:43.87]There's the souvenir, give it a test.
[217:19.01]What happened?
[217:20.37]What the heck?
[217:28.54]Oh my goodness.
[217:36.06]Listen, you do not run around and throw stuff into people's faces, okay?
[217:45.25]Alright.
[217:55.13]That's it, right?
[218:03.08]What, he didn't autosave?
[218:09.36]I thought it autosaved right after I killed him.
[218:15.09]Oh, shit.
[218:15.57]I thought it was an auto-save.
[218:16.82]Oh, sorry.
[218:17.60]Whoops.
[218:21.72]Oh, well.
[218:22.60]Damn it.
[218:22.96]I thought it was an auto-save after I killed him.
[218:27.04]Hey, remember this?
[218:28.40]Hey, take a look.
[218:31.25]Alright, I can just leave.
[218:32.77]He's going to do it and die.
[218:35.61]I'm going to leave.
[218:39.99]Wait, actually, I need to, like... I need to greet him and then leave.
[218:47.46]So, a wave to him.
[218:50.10]There's the secret Krabby Patty.
[218:57.67]Cocaine's given a recipe.
[218:59.07]I've got the recipe now.
[219:00.09]Uh-huh.
[219:01.89]Alright.
[219:03.54]Hi.
[219:04.44]Hey.
[219:04.70]Alright.
[219:05.58]Bye.
[219:12.56]He'll do it, right?
[219:15.00]I don't want to run away, just to make sure he actually goes up to it.
[219:22.24]Hey, look who hasn't moved an inch.
[219:29.68]Look who hasn't moved even a centimeter.
[219:35.66]Okay, there it goes.
[219:38.19]And it's time to leave.
[220:04.51]Alright.
[220:09.78]Let's get the last one.
[220:20.98]The girl.
[220:22.56]That is standing still.
[220:23.72]Let's climb back up here.
[220:30.13]Make our way...
[220:32.98]Like the statue is supposed to kill her?
[220:35.58]I don't know.
[220:37.00]I really don't know.
[220:40.59]Probably not.
[220:44.85]If it was, then... We're at a... Oh, they're searching... Is this like a final destination moment?
[220:55.01]Where she was supposed to die?
[220:57.16]And she still is just sitting right there.
[221:10.93]I don't think we're gonna get much better than that.
[221:12.51]Yeah, take a picture.
[221:13.03]They're taking pictures of the stat.
[221:14.15]No, they're taking pictures of me.
[221:17.61]So, um... I think I kind of just have to throw something at her.
[221:30.60]What can I do?
[221:31.52]I have a cocaine bricker to death.
[221:37.43]Scissors, fish...
[221:40.55]She's not going to die from the fish.
[221:43.49]Somebody just writes pistol.
[221:50.95]Let me just see if she moves.
[221:52.09]If she does anything.
[221:52.83]Is she going to move?
[222:01.15]That guy just took a picture.
[222:02.99]I just got a sports... Did he say showing off?
[222:07.23]I mean, kind of.
[222:08.43]So I have a car... Keys to a car.
[222:17.40]Something like spraying your ankle.
[222:18.80]Alright, what are the exit points?
[222:21.70]Because... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:24.33]Sports car key.
[222:26.59]A key matches one of Rico Delgado's sports cars.
[222:32.40]Alright, let me see the map.
[222:33.64]Where is the... Where are the exits?
[222:38.24]Are they not listed here yet?
[222:46.58]I'm going to assume probably this way.
[222:49.55]This way.
[222:50.13]Let's see if I can get it to move.
[223:06.20]Okay.
[223:10.84]She's still just looking at the... She's waiting for something to happen on here.
[223:17.97]You want me to play?
[223:34.18]Get the band back together.
[223:45.63]I just have to kill her.
[223:48.61]Is there anything I can throw over there or do something?
[223:51.29]Whoa, easy.
[223:56.55]This key.
[223:58.53]I think I'm just going to have to shoot her.
[224:00.22]Or throw scissors at her head and run.
[224:03.51]Because it doesn't look like she's moving anywhere.
[224:05.21]Unless I can maybe activate a... Do I have any other intel or objectives or mission stories or something?
[224:12.11]Here we go.
[224:13.69]Undying Love.
[224:14.57]Let's follow this one.
[224:15.59]See if we can get it to work.
[224:20.87]That's far away.
[224:24.52]Throw a bullet at her head.
[224:27.90]I think I was just all the way back here.
[224:50.53]All targets neutralized.
[224:53.93]This should paralyze the cartel.
[224:56.01]Excellent work, 47.
[224:57.48]Now head for an exit.
[224:58.98]Oh shit!
[224:59.88]Alright, this way.
[225:01.68]I'll head down here.
[225:06.58]Oh shit!
[225:16.90]Well, it's not what I necessarily wanted to do, but...
[225:20.22]Kinda had to do it.
[225:27.45]Watch out for the, uh... Turn on the motor.
[225:33.27]Get in the boat.
[225:45.48]Would you arc the scissors and do that behind cover, like throwing bricks?
[225:51.40]people fishing there.
[225:54.00]I don't think so.
[225:54.94]I think it just bumps into them and they go home?
[226:00.58]Well, I did two of the story missions.
[226:05.06]Let's see what we get here in our roulette.
[226:07.82]The boss, the cook, the face.
[226:09.41]Someone could hurt themselves.
[226:10.69]Tasteless.
[226:11.43]Straight shot.
[226:13.07]Mission story.
[226:14.51]On a pedestal.
[226:15.41]Still as a statue.
[226:17.03]The secret ingredient.
[226:19.61]One star.
[226:26.02]Isn't it like 3 a.m.
[226:27.23]right now in America?
[226:28.29]Um, not quite.
[226:31.35]It is 9, just about 10 p.m.
[226:33.93]Eastern.
[226:39.75]Like, I'm gonna, I told you, I'm gonna get one star every single time.
[226:43.15]Just because of the nature of, at least playing for the first time.
[226:48.63]I've gotta try to do the weird shit.
[226:50.38]Okay, new level, cool.
[226:56.29]New hidden stash in the hostel.
[227:00.43]I unlocked a fragmentation grenade.
[227:04.77]So I get grenades now.
[227:05.81]Sedatives.
[227:08.13]Village hostel.
[227:09.23]Village bar.
[227:11.99]Cool.
[227:12.55]Mission stories.
[227:14.31]So I did this one.
[227:16.01]There are these two that I did not do.
[227:18.03]Deadly art and hallowed ground.
[227:21.17]Maybe one day, but I want to keep looking.
[227:24.57]This next one is untouchable.
[227:32.52]How many missions are in the base game?
[227:33.52]Six.
[227:33.60]Well, but I mean missions as in areas.
[227:58.50]Were you expecting a real answer or a joke?
[228:00.58]I mean, when enough people write the real one, I can kind of read between the lines.
[228:05.14]I'm not as strong as you.
[228:07.80]They have to pay for what they did.
[228:11.12]It needs to stop.
[228:13.38]You need to stop.
[228:16.22]If my source checks out, we can prove the board knew about the chemical leaks.
[228:21.55]There are six new locations.
[228:22.55]I have grounds for a retrial.
[228:27.46]They're too powerful.
[228:29.60]They're not the devil, Nancy.
[228:31.56]Just a company.
[228:33.00]They're not above the law.
[228:34.22]This is bigger than James.
[228:36.54]Those bastards killed 80 people.
[228:40.33]And they got away with it.
[228:42.87]Think about what that means.
[228:45.33]No one's untouchable.
[228:48.33]No one's untouchable.
[228:50.81]Huh?
[228:52.29]Oh, that's Diana.
[228:57.61]Diana!
[228:59.43]Coming!
[229:05.92]Mom?
[229:36.18]bat woman now we're in south africa for cutscene part two oh he got the virus
[230:10.93]Oh, I got like five minutes to do this whole mission.
[230:13.47]I better be quick.
[230:14.83]Alright.
[230:15.35]Continuing on.
[230:16.09]To chasing a ghost.
[230:41.74]I failed the mission, unfortunately.
[230:47.51]Good evening, 47.
[230:48.91]The militia has released a hostage tape outing the existence of Providence to the world.
[230:54.59]This was a fatal mistake and our analysts are tracing its origin as we speak.
[230:59.61]In the meantime, we have a lead on Lucas Gray's top lieutenant.
[231:03.59]Turns out the Delgado Cartel's counterfeiting unit was creating fake IDs for the militia, and one operative in particular stands out.
[231:11.15]Wazir Khali, an infamous South China Sea pirate, better known by his nom de guerre, the Maelstrom.
[231:18.48]The Maelstrom and his cutthroat band of outlaws were the scourge of the shipping industry in the post-recession years.
[231:24.58]Hmm.
[231:44.11]But we believe it was he who carried out the audacious killing of a Providence CEO in Shanghai, along with two reactivated members of his old pirate gang, Vanya Shah, a shady figure in Mumbai's criminal underworld, and Dawood Rangan, the gang's old cashier turned dodgy movie producer.
[232:01.70]Shah, Rangan, and the Maelstrom form Lucas Gray's Eastern Self.
[232:05.96]They are a crack strike team, and stopping them is our client's most pressing concern.
[232:11.52]unfortunately the elusive maelstrom appears to have vanished into the seedy underbelly of mumbai the cradle of his criminal legend and no one knows his whereabouts or what he currently looks like I know he looks like a bandit queen a showbiz charlatan and one certifiable ghost I shall leave you to prepare I don't even know what he looks like how am I supposed to find him
[232:41.33]All right.
[232:42.71]So, we've got to find the maelstrom and verify his identity.
[232:46.90]Then we've got to get rid of Vanya.
[232:52.70]And Dawood.
[232:56.16]Dawood.
[232:59.56]Any method, any way possible.
[233:02.99]Let's go to the planning stage.
[233:05.01]All right.
[233:05.39]Smuggling in an item.
[233:07.17]I can't do anything.
[233:08.65]Don't have any smuggling locations.
[233:13.40]So, concealed weapon.
[233:14.58]We're obviously going to take the chrome one.
[233:20.16]Uh, yep.
[233:20.92]Fiber wire.
[233:21.58]I have grenades too, right?
[233:22.84]Don't.
[233:23.34]I'm not bringing those.
[233:25.11]What a mistake that would be.
[233:26.09]Okay.
[233:37.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
[233:37.92]What are you doing?
[233:46.56]That looks good.
[233:47.19]Give me the chrome.
[233:48.91]And I'm ready.
[233:59.29]Fish.
[233:59.90]A duck.
[234:04.66]The old aquatic animal loadout.
[234:10.70]Fish and a duck.
[234:14.35]You bet I'm in a robe.
[234:15.59]I'm in a tank top.
[234:17.23]One of the most densely populated cities in the world.
[234:20.25]Home to more than 12 million people.
[234:23.31]If you wanted to disappear and hide from the world, this vast city is perfect.
[234:29.29]The maze-like, sprawling slums offer secret paths and surprises around every corner.
[234:34.25]Secret paths and corners.
[234:35.39]I'm gonna get lost here.
[234:36.61]The elusive maelstrom knows the city like the back of his own hand.
[234:40.21]Locating him will be a considerable challenge.
[234:43.97]A place to start could be the slums where his former gang, the Crows, has recently risen from the ashes.
[234:49.67]Okay.
[234:51.07]Dawood Rangan will be easy to find in his half-finished tower, wrapping up his new film called Mumbai Hero.
[234:56.87]I want to do that one.
[234:58.33]While Vanya Shah has ensconced herself in the overgrown remains of an old train yard.
[235:02.21]I want to go to the movie set.
[235:03.69]Your three targets call this labyrinthine part of the city home, so choose your approach carefully.
[235:10.13]Let's do the movie one.
[235:19.40]Alright.
[235:20.98]So, we are looking for... The movie studio.
[235:28.13]I want to be a star.
[235:31.11]Is this a giant car accident?
[235:39.90]What kind of cars are these?
[235:41.02]Why is there like a five car pileup?
[235:44.22]Golf cart.
[235:47.93]That's a really strange car.
[235:57.39]Can I play anything?
[236:05.37]What do they got on here?
[236:08.53]Oh, look at that.
[236:09.21]Isn't that funny?
[236:10.71]They got the original Hitman 2 on here.
[236:14.76]What is that?
[236:19.97]Oh, I could!
[236:20.51]I could play!
[236:25.19]Freedom Fighters.
[236:29.44]Alright.
[236:31.42]Hmm... Why are these all points of interest on there?
[236:44.39]Hmm...
[236:46.39]Damn this is huge.
[236:48.79]Oh god It just got bigger it just got even bigger Central Square
[237:04.85]47.
[237:05.41]The street gang known as the Crows are on high alert.
[237:08.17]I don't care about the Crows.
[237:08.85]What is this?
[237:09.11]They seem to be on the lookout for potential assassins and will be suspicious of anyone they don't recognize.
[237:14.66]I suggest you are mindful around them in the slums.
[237:17.26]So, if you don't recognize me, then I'm in trouble.
[237:22.24]Okay.
[237:26.78]So, there are actual sentries now.
[237:33.02]I don't think it was like that before in the other game.
[237:34.82]Let's just go down here.
[237:35.56]Taxi, taxi, let's go, sir.
[237:39.84]Taxi, can you take me to the movie studio?
[237:41.36]I might need this.
[237:54.67]Just in case there's water somewhere, I might be able to use this.
[237:58.96]No, I don't want to do that.
[238:01.12]I don't want to do that.
[238:02.30]I want to find the movie studio.
[238:04.80]I'm sure that's the thing that you can do right away, but we're not doing that one.
[238:10.16]Okay, thank God.
[238:10.58]Hello.
[238:10.70]Hello.
[238:29.87]Well, there's a crow right here.
[238:31.81]Oh, no.
[238:32.47]Don't look at me.
[238:33.90]Oh, fuck.
[238:43.60]I just turned off their electricity.
[238:45.28]Shit.
[238:51.05]Oh, I want to do this, too.
[238:51.77]Can I do this, too?
[238:54.89]Yes.
[238:55.23]Let me show you.
[238:57.71]Check this.
[238:58.09]Ready?
[239:01.78]I didn't do as good as you guys did, but... Pick that up.
[239:05.88]Pick that up.
[239:06.68]No, no.
[239:07.10]Don't stop this.
[239:07.70]I gotta, like, save the game.
[239:33.46]Right here, right at the beginning.
[239:40.35]Okay, now let's see what happens.
[239:44.21]How does this work?
[239:59.98]Nice!
[240:01.58]So I want to see how it works.
[240:03.02]Do people just pick it up?
[240:12.45]Nice!
[240:12.91]Jesus Christ, I was dozing off.
[240:17.07]That scared me.
[240:17.69]I'm sorry.
[240:21.35]Why would you be interested in a duck?
[240:23.82]I don't know.
[240:24.94]I would be pretty interested.
[240:36.16]I got extra fish.
[240:37.24]Perfect.
[240:54.53]Why was I expecting piranhas?
[241:11.68]They can't get in there.
[241:14.00]Wait, look at the fishing rod.
[241:14.86]Oh, it's...
[241:31.99]Maelstrom?
[241:32.75]You know who Maelstrom is, huh?
[241:53.49]So, armed thugs belonging to the street gang known as the Crows have evacuated a hill in the slums of Mumbai.
[242:00.62]This could be worth investigating.
[242:03.82]No, alright, here we go.
[242:05.06]A close shave, a dress to die for, a matter of discipline, broad strokes, flames rekindled, gone with the wind, and then picture perfect!
[242:23.12]I don't care about this.
[242:24.21]Let's do the dress.
[242:25.33]Junkyard discovered?
[242:43.16]What's up here?
[242:43.84]Wrench
[243:11.87]Mumbai Hills.
[243:33.79]Hey, you're trying to get us.
[243:35.37]You stop.
[243:38.85]Not worth the hassle, man.
[243:44.58]Uh... Wrench in face?
[243:57.57]No, no, no.
[243:58.17]No wrench in face.
[244:02.88]Perfect.
[244:03.54]Not perfect.
[244:04.44]I wish I had three... Thank god for the sword again.
[244:19.34]I gotta do it.
[244:19.72]Both of you turn around.
[244:21.37]Come on.
[244:47.67]What was my plan?
[244:48.40]What was my plan?
[244:49.02]What was my plan?
[244:49.64]What was my plan?
[244:50.18]I don't know what my plan was.
[244:51.06]Got him.
[245:36.16]Alright, I gotta have a different approach here.

[247:20.01]Shh.

[252:15.04]Uh, where did he go?
[252:18.72]He's going this way.
[252:19.86]What is that?
[252:20.36]I can do something with these?
[252:27.38]These are all explosions.
[252:30.88]Well, I'll try going through here.

[253:38.08]It's perfect.
[253:48.36]Okay.
[253:59.10]Okay.
[254:00.30]What did he have?
[254:01.48]He didn't have the same gun.
[254:02.42]Well, hold on.
[254:09.66]What?!
[254:10.14]Hey!
[254:10.58]What?!
[254:16.79]Why did I die?
[254:25.87]I was standing- I threw it down there!
[254:34.41]Okay.
[254:35.85]Well... I know that that's safe over here, so we're good.
[254:42.25]I need his clothes first.
[255:01.86]Electricity holds no bounds.
[255:05.94]Alright, I got the shotgun.
[255:08.83]I have to be the guy with the shotgun.
[255:15.47]Got it.
[255:17.07]Okay.
[255:26.32]Don't play with fire.
[255:27.52]Alright, almost hit the dress mission.
[255:30.78]I'm so looking forward to this.
[255:38.19]Save it right here.
[255:47.10]Somebody found that body.
[255:50.14]What are you doing down there?
[255:54.21]Alright, I need to be a tailor.
[256:18.45]It appears Vanya Shah is in the market for a dress fit for a queen.
[256:22.87]She's sent after a local tailor, but for some reason the man refuses to cooperate.
[256:28.24]A man of your impeccable taste should be able to fill in perfectly for the tailor.
[256:35.66]Disguise yourself as the tailor.
[256:37.60]Well, there he is.
[256:39.80]Hey.
[256:48.81]I'm coming for you.
[256:55.59]Just want to make sure you're well aware.
[256:58.59]I'm coming in there.
[257:03.82]I wonder if I can get in through here and then go down.
[257:20.49]Um, I could if I had a lockpick instead of the stupid duck.
[257:31.82]Wait a minute.
[257:58.95]No, why are you coming all the way?
[258:05.09]Why would you come?
[258:11.45]Excellent.
[258:12.43]Let's find out what kind of dress a woman like Vanya Shah wants.
[258:23.81]Oh!
[258:43.94]Why did that guy come and pick it up?
[258:45.58]I just wanted, I just wanted, I wasn't going to blow it up.
[258:48.22]I wasn't going to blow it up.
[258:50.93]I was going to try to have the tailor come out and pick it up and then just go in.
[258:58.95]Play with permadeath?
[259:00.11]No way.
[259:00.79]All right.
[259:02.59]So I need to get in there somehow.
[259:05.49]Both doors probably cannot be unlocked.
[259:07.59]I can't get through upstairs.
[259:10.03]I can go up this way, which maybe I can get on the roof and go through the ceiling.
[259:15.12]Let's find out.
[259:17.86]Yes.
[259:18.92]I can.
[259:19.82]So, where do I go?
[259:22.16]I gotta go across this way.
[259:23.78]Old crosswalk.
[259:25.74]He didn't say yes, did he?
[259:26.58]I know it's a great honor to be able
[259:35.03]Alright, let's go over here.
[259:37.31]Save our game.
[259:38.51]Have you tried stealing the china?
[259:46.08]I have not.
[259:47.04]I have not tried that yet.
[259:49.24]Maybe it'll be good.
[259:50.08]I'm trespassing.
[259:51.60]Who's looking at me?
[260:04.07]I'm not supposed to be in here.
[260:09.15]What's this?
[260:11.05]Measuring tape.
[260:14.93]Uh... Okay.
[260:19.21]What's this?
[260:19.77]We got... Request to the tailor.
[260:22.69]Coins.
[260:26.47]Fuse box.
[260:27.28]Alright.
[260:27.68]This pulls them upstairs.
[260:29.58]What else we got?
[260:31.16]I need to... Can I open this?
[260:36.71]I need to blow the fuse box, and then I need to measuring tape choke the guy to death.
[260:45.48]Yeah.
[260:47.98]Alright, let's give it a go.
[261:15.98]That's not the tailor.
[261:22.97]That's not even the tailor.
[261:27.31]Where at?
[261:27.83]What building am I in?
[261:38.04]What?
[262:00.40]Greetings, sir.
[262:01.48]Can I?
[262:03.01]There's got to be.
[262:03.77]Hey, who are you?
[262:09.73]I don't know what I picked up.
[262:12.47]I bet that guy breaks a lot of hearts.
[262:28.58]All right, let's see.
[262:30.20]Save it.
[262:58.81]We have been oppressed by her false rule long enough, and someone needs to take a stand.
[263:03.81]Besides, she killed everyone that came to her.
[263:07.67]Nobody knows what she wants.
[263:09.75]I can't risk it.
[263:10.61]Will you two get out of here?
[263:12.45]There's no one else here.
[263:13.49]There's a bundle of money hidden in a box under the power junction near the waterfall.
[263:18.23]It's for you.
[263:19.69]If you need more, talk to the people at the shop.
[263:23.29]They will help you.
[263:25.43]I know
[263:27.34]Oh, he switched to Bluetooth.
[263:38.15]What?
[263:58.58]Fuckers, get away from me.
[264:03.55]Oh, you two idiots.
[264:05.03]Yeah.
[264:35.30]He doesn't know where he went.
[264:37.64]He doesn't know where he went.
[264:40.00]He's like, there was just a person here.
[264:43.37]Excellent.
[265:02.34]Eggs.
[265:03.42]Eggs.
[265:05.99]Well, to be fair, he heard an explosion, turned around, and the guy wasn't here.
[265:11.35]This was the opportunity.
[265:12.59]I need to... Oh, my God.
[265:16.55]These people are going to see it.
[265:22.27]If these two weren't here, this would be so easy.
[265:28.75]If you turn left, I can't do it here.
[265:31.33]Of course, they leave now.
[265:33.73]Oh, I almost want to throw the duck over there.
[265:36.81]You know, I got a better idea.
[265:41.34]Fuck this.
[265:44.30]Watch this.
[266:04.23]You two don't want that.
[266:13.21]Nobody wants that duck?
[266:18.06]Fine.
[266:20.18]I'll get it.
[266:20.62]Okay.
[266:36.93]I'm just going to have to keep following him.
[266:43.15]I'm just going to have to keep following him because I can't stop him here.
[266:52.32]He's going to see me throw the coin.
[266:53.58]I did.
[266:53.70]No, I'm going to have to follow him again.
[267:07.44]Just wait till I get the right opportunity.
[267:23.69]Okay, here we go.
[267:25.95]Sitting on the bench.
[267:26.65]Oh, why are you here?
[267:28.55]How do I give this guy a heart attack?
[267:30.36]Um, do you mind checking that out?
[267:32.36]Yeah, sure.
[268:00.61]Oh, come on!
[268:01.79]He turned around!
[268:02.73]What?
[268:07.24]What?
[268:07.52]What?
[268:08.10]What?
[268:08.74]What?
[268:09.38]What?
[268:10.78]What?
[268:11.46]What?
[268:11.76]If he didn't turn around, I would have just choked him.
[268:29.63]What what what what what?
[268:35.50]Every time this guy finds a place to stop at a place that's sort of off the beaten path a little Somebody goes and like lies down next to him Where three people come and have a conversation I need to set up something on his path
[268:52.78]Is there something I can do here?
[268:55.88]If he gets too close, for instance, radio.
[268:59.24]Just go listen to the radio, dude.
[269:02.94]Thank you.
[269:07.08]Go check it out.
[269:07.72]I've tried to...
[269:28.10]Okay, that's bullshit.
[269:31.12]Bullshit, man.
[269:33.32]I tried.
[269:35.79]Excellent.
[269:36.77]Let's find out what kind of dress a woman like Vanya Shah wants.
[269:41.29]I need to get rid of the shotgun.
[269:45.35]Perhaps you will be able to source a roll of the right fabric at the local cloth market.
[269:57.26]Somebody's going to see that.
[270:03.49]Somebody's going to see it.
[270:05.59]And I can't do anything about it.
[270:07.43]And I'm going to save, and it's going to ruin everything.
[270:10.33]I need to have another save point here to make sure, just in case.
[270:12.97]It's going to be right over here.
[270:17.31]Because I had that one back before.
[270:21.49]He's just suntanning.
[270:25.91]What's going on?
[270:34.82]Hear that?
[270:35.89]That's you frying in oil, baby.
[270:52.76]Of course.
[271:01.04]Why always me?
[271:02.99]I have to leave Mumbai for a while.

[271:17.98]Excellent.
[271:18.96]Let's find out what kind of dress a woman like Vanya Shah wants.
[271:24.51]Okay, he's fine.
[271:25.07]Good.
[271:25.17]I gotta get rid of the shotgun.
[271:26.03]How do I throw the shotgun?
[271:26.77]Okay.
[271:55.44]What is that?
[271:56.00]Soda can.

[272:17.60]I need to get cloth.
[272:21.52]Let's keep going.
[272:22.16]Through the alley.
[272:22.74]Okay.
[272:30.29]Just looking for cloth.
[272:31.45]Just looking for the right cloth.
[272:32.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[273:29.92]Green cloth.
[273:31.98]Sage cloth.
[273:33.08]I need five coins.
[273:34.46]Does that sound fair?
[273:50.33]I've been throwing my coins.
[273:53.03]Ah, I can see your amount of refined taste and a skilled hatter.
[273:56.81]My kids will only eat rice tonight, but it's yours for 105 rupees.
[274:02.15]Okay.
[274:02.86]That's a pretty decent price.

[274:24.71]I don't have that either.
[274:26.39]Make it cheaper.
[274:27.74]Still no.
[274:29.04]Your haggling skills are something else.
[274:31.40]I'll give you that much.
[274:32.92]The silence, it's terribly unnerving, to be honest.
[274:37.76]It's like you're just dead inside.
[274:40.71]Like there's a vast, empty space where your emotions would normally reside.
[274:46.22]I can go no lower than 75 degrees.
[274:47.94]Really.
[274:48.46]Take the offer.
[274:49.98]Please take the offer.
[274:55.18]You know what?
[274:56.24]My grandmother made these with her own hands.
[274:58.90]There's blood on the loom every night because she worked so hard.
[275:02.81]This is one of those scenarios where I'm looking through him to somebody else.
[275:07.24]And he... What?
[275:10.44]He went back up?
[275:13.16]Okay, fine.
[275:15.20]The story about my grandmother is a lie.
[275:17.60]We both know it.
[275:19.06]Silence is killing me here.
[275:20.22]Just have it at what I buy it for.
[275:24.75]40 rupees, that's it.
[275:25.97]Please.
[275:26.83]It's a fair price.

[275:34.18]Ah, good, good.
[275:35.64]Take any of the bundles, please.
[275:37.68]Just one, though.
[275:38.78]Hey!
[275:39.76]Just one.
[275:40.24]What color does she want?
[275:43.48]What color does she want for... ...dress for when she's sent after a local tailor?
[275:50.08]Intel, what color dress do you want?
[275:52.60]By decree of the generous Vanya, you are able to present to her a sample of your finest cerulean cloth and to perform a measuring for the most exquisite gown Mumbai has ever seen.
[276:01.59]What color is that?
[276:07.03]Make her a gown, but the tail is reluctant.
[276:16.12]Make a nice tie.
[276:17.98]So that's blue.
[276:18.60]So I'm going to take the blue one.
[276:23.26]Great.
[276:24.12]Thank you.
[276:24.82]Come again.
[276:25.84]Okay, make it work.
[276:43.48]Well, I got all the bases covered, so I'm fine.
[276:45.38]Alright, arrange an audience with Vanya.
[276:50.40]She is this way.
[276:56.89]Why am I still holding this cannon?
[277:05.19]Alright, here we go.
[277:12.56]Arrange an audience.
[277:13.62]I have all the cloth.
[277:16.13]I did?
[277:16.29]I got green, I got blue, I got red.
[277:17.91]I have a gun.
[277:18.37]I have a gun.
[277:19.29]I have a gun.
[277:20.41]I have a gun.
[277:40.28]Okay.
[277:40.52]Okay, come on.
[277:41.18]They're gonna bring it down.
[277:43.34]I'm staring and they're gonna do what the cloth guy said.
[277:48.72]They'll do it.
[277:49.14]They're gonna do it.
[277:49.62]That guy was point blank.
[278:11.56]Hold on guys, let me just put my gun down.
[278:21.83]He took that.
[278:23.63]He took a full shotgun blast to the chest and the back of the shoulder and didn't even flinch.
[278:42.57]Come on.
[278:43.31]Let's see what you have in your pockets today.
[278:46.77]Oh, wait.
[278:47.14]What about... I do have the duck.
[278:48.88]And it'll be over soon.
[278:51.56]Are they going to find the duck?
[278:52.64]But the duck is just a duck.
[278:55.66]Go on ahead.
[278:56.74]Hey, man.
[278:57.36]Follow me.
[279:03.35]You don't want to test my patience.
[279:04.77]It's virtually non-existent.
[279:17.70]You can't be here.

[279:36.55]Alright, so sorry, I like sneezed over there and walked back.
[279:55.92]Yeah, I just sneezed the gun out of the trash can.
[280:06.16]Alright, do it.
[280:06.66]Now pick it up and throw the gun over the fence.
[280:11.29]I don't think I can throw the gun.
[280:12.97]Can you throw the gun?
[280:14.65]No, I'm not gonna throw the gun over the fence.
[280:17.59]I'm gonna go.
[280:27.03]You can't throw a gun.
[280:28.71]You just drop a gun.
[280:29.75]So she wasn't happy with the other tailors.

[286:05.92]This dress is important to me.

[287:49.38]He looked like he worked in the fashion industry.
[287:52.31]Like a tailor, perhaps.
[287:53.93]Hold on.
[287:55.07]I just saw that guy.
[287:56.95]Okay, he can't hide anymore.
[287:58.63]I know what the fucker looks like.
[288:00.51]You look like a tailor, I guess.
[288:02.73]He kind of looks like a tailor, I think.
[288:06.52]What does he look like?
[288:07.46]I think he looks kind of like a tailor.
[288:08.90]What the hell do you think you're doing?
[288:18.09]This is a restricted area.
[288:21.69]This shit just got real.

[289:04.76]So.
[289:05.02]Now, I'm gonna go... I can go up.
[289:13.47]No, I wanna go down.
[289:36.28]Alright.
[289:44.31]What is this guy doing?
[289:47.51]That guy just saved the game.
[289:50.37]Thanks, dude.
[289:52.01]I guess there was like a save point poll that I missed.
[290:06.64]I'm the NPC.
[290:11.78]I mean, yeah, I guess.
[290:40.17]all right so we got mission story let's see I want to do broad strokes this one looks interesting I can't go like this

[291:14.45]Am I- Is this my life now?
[291:16.05]Do I just sell magazines?
[291:23.71]Alright, let's go up there.
[291:30.34]Watch out for the guys with the circles.
[291:33.28]Alright, up there.
[291:34.30]Alright, that was- I had a lot of fun.
[291:36.32]That was great.
[291:40.63]We got to see it two different ways.
[291:41.97]We got to rewind and pull back and see the story twice.
[291:48.37]This game's fucking fun.
[291:50.01]What a great game.
[291:51.53]What a fun video game.
[291:52.81]I need to go up there.
[291:56.65]Can I cross through?
[292:13.15]straight this way across the beam or do I need to go across the beam I need to get over there hold on is there no other way for me to jump over there can I climb up that
[292:36.28]Oh, really?
[292:36.88]Come on.
[292:37.28]I can't get up there?
[292:37.90]I can't traverse that?
[292:39.40]Damn it.
[292:40.40]Alright, well, I guess I'm gonna go the other way.
[292:43.16]Maybe there's a ladder this way.
[293:00.67]What about right there?
[293:02.81]I gotta go up from here somehow.
[293:04.53]There we go.
[293:04.97]Got it.
[293:05.13]Okay.
[293:05.25]Let's go pay him a visit.
[293:27.22]Strange tenant.
[293:28.20]I'm currently trespassing.
[293:29.38]So, you know.
[293:29.76]How do you trespass in an apartment building?
[293:30.94]How can they not... What the fuck?
[293:32.70]I'd say we're dealing with a local operator known as the Kashmirian.
[294:03.33]a local hitman known as the Kashmirian is in Mumbai on business he set up a sniper nest in a tower above a stairwell in the local tool it appears he's targeting okay good thinking 47 now
[294:23.41]If we could only make Rangan appear in that window somehow.
[294:25.94]Why don't I-
[294:56.84]Why don't I just get a better view myself?
[295:05.99]You're right.
[295:06.41]I'll just go over there.
[295:08.55]And then aim up into the window.
[295:12.05]Oh, the scope isn't adjusted.
[295:13.23]That's right.
[295:15.71]Maybe I should take his clothes.
[295:19.59]He's got a dongle?
[295:21.05]Laptop dongle.
[295:22.69]Apartment key.
[295:24.61]And he lives here.
[295:26.33]Not trespassing anymore.
[295:27.33]Alright, so, let me see this again.
[295:38.98]So I need to find a way to get his attention.
[295:41.82]To get him to the window.
[295:45.54]How do I get his attention?
[295:57.69]A coin.
[295:59.15]A coin doesn't reach that far.
[296:03.78]Throw a soda can across the city.
[296:13.76]I think they hit somebody right in the head.
[296:20.68]Shoot the window to make him check the window.
[296:26.02]Why am I shooting at him anyways?
[296:28.22]Why don't I just take this?
[296:32.04]Who cares about that guy?
[296:33.30]Where's the guy I need to kill?
[296:34.30]He's like up there.
[296:34.94]Where's the other person I need to kill?
[296:43.40]Is it just two?
[296:43.92]Oh, there's another... Okay, I gotta... He's inside the building.
[297:09.40]Just get his attention.
[297:13.94]I mean, I could shoot the window.
[297:20.40]But that kind of defeats the purpose of being down here.
[297:23.10]I have to go all the way down?
[297:32.55]I'm gonna try and shoot the window.
[297:40.30]Just to see what happens.
[297:45.44]I can't shoot.
[297:45.96]It won't shoot until he's there, so let's shoot with this and put it back.
[298:01.31]Did he hear it?
[298:08.75]shoot through his open window okay
[298:37.81]Here he comes!
[298:40.76]SHOOT HIM!
[298:41.34]WHAT?!
[298:54.41]It didn't fire!
[299:16.53]This is obviously not correct.
[299:35.04]Backflip.
[299:35.92]PogChamp.
[299:36.78]Alright, well I'm going to restart it.
[299:37.94]And I'm going to go into the apartment building.
[299:43.26]What is it shaking so violently?
[299:59.47]If only you had a tripod, this would go so much more smoothly.
[300:07.77]Alright.
[300:15.10]You alright?
[300:19.72]So, I'm going to go to the apartment.
[300:21.34]I have an apartment key now.
[300:23.89]That didn't shoot yet, right?
[300:25.05]No.
[300:25.51]Okay.
[300:25.63]Let's take a look.
[300:29.93]I got a key.
[300:30.67]Let's examine and see if I can scream at him.
[300:33.91]Maybe there's a megaphone in this apartment somewhere.
[300:42.95]What?
[300:49.09]Adjust the scope?
[300:50.17]I did!
[300:50.51]I adjusted the scope, and he was like, good!
[300:53.07]Okay, here we go.
[300:55.13]Department key.
[300:58.29]Cleaver.
[300:58.65]What the hell is he watching?
[301:23.83]Okay.
[301:27.16]We got... Oh!
[301:28.46]Lethal poison pills.
[301:31.52]Luggage?
[301:31.82]Can I do anything with the luggage?
[301:32.82]No.
[301:34.94]Okay.
[301:35.42]Pick up picture of... Picture of Vanya.
[301:43.71]Surveillance image of Vanya.
[301:46.35]Overlooking the Mumbai laundry business.
[301:48.73]A note on the back says, Excellent position.
[301:51.12]Meeting with foreman.
[301:56.37]Okay.
[301:56.61]It's an old computer.
[301:57.21]Okay.
[301:57.33]Well, that's different places I can perch up.
[302:31.01]Interesting.
[302:31.61]All right.
[302:33.83]Well, it's giving me locations to where I can... Nothing else.
[302:46.90]Open the fridge.
[302:51.38]That's not the fridge.
[302:54.58]That's not a fridge either.
[302:55.58]This is a fridge.
[302:58.31]I can't open the fridge.
[303:00.57]I can't open the fridge.
[303:01.51]Alright, I'm going back up.
[303:03.79]I'm taking the sniper rifle.
[303:04.79]You know what I'm saying?
[303:14.95]What is that?
[303:18.42]An iron.
[303:19.50]Oh boy.
[303:20.40]Get people out of my way.
[303:26.82]Good luck hiding it.
[303:27.56]I'll just drop it in trash cans and shit.
[303:37.33]Let me look at the sniper rifle again.
[303:44.08]So... This can't be adjusted.
[303:47.66]How am I gonna get his attention?
[304:07.39]I don't get it.
[304:12.42]I mean, I guess I can use the sniper to shoot the other guy.
[304:26.87]Wait a minute.
[304:28.91]I can't do this.
[304:36.59]Oh, he is supposed to.
[304:43.34]Right.
[304:46.36]So I can't do this.
[305:01.86]Well.
[305:05.66]Don't tell me I can't do something.
[305:15.76]Damn.
[305:17.90]What?
[305:30.79]Do we know what the guy looks like?
[305:38.85]Whoa!
[306:00.36]I can't hide there.
[306:04.18]Holy shit.
[306:04.68]Someone, please, help me.
[306:12.14]Oh, no.
[306:15.06]Someone's carrying us.
[306:39.10]The gun wouldn't fire.
[306:40.68]The gun doesn't fire.
[306:42.46]The gun doesn't fire.
[306:48.62]Did I kill him in both scenarios?
[306:54.74]Is he dead in both scenarios?
[306:56.52]Oh, he's dead in both scenarios.
[306:59.98]I saved it and saved it.
[307:01.44]Fucking hell.
[307:11.28]No, I'm not going back all the way there.
[307:13.32]I'm just gonna scare the shit out of people.
[307:17.27]Watch.
[307:24.45]I want this, though.
[307:25.39]Okay, what if I... I don't want this guy's disguise anymore.
[307:31.37]I'm gonna put on the bodyguard costume.
[307:38.20]Wait, what?
[307:50.31]Got it.
[308:01.45]Right, OK.
[308:01.95]He's a traveling salesman or something.
[308:05.13]I was sitting there trying to figure out the whole time how to distract the guy.
[308:16.98]It turns out I killed the whole story mission because I shot the guy with his own rifle.
[308:24.70]That's how I'm understanding this, right?
[308:25.86]That's correct?
[308:29.03]Did I miss the stairs?
[308:35.70]Okay, here we go.
[308:52.87]Alright, now I gotta fix the scope.
[308:54.89]I was wondering why all the hints stopped.
[308:56.87]Oh my god.
[309:23.88]This is... I'm trying to figure this out for so long.
[309:30.62]God, I'm being surprised.
[309:31.22]Talk to the assassin.
[309:31.90]No, I'm not gonna talk to him.
[309:51.09]How does a professional assassin not know how to focus a scope?
[309:55.61]I have no idea.
[310:00.65]That's like the equivalent of knowing how to draw with crayons as a child.
[310:05.53]A toddler.
[310:09.71]Alright, so now we have to make him go in the window.
[310:14.62]And then we have to find the maelstrom.
[310:17.16]So how do I...
[310:23.13]I'm going to distract him?
[310:26.79]Infiltrate the apartment.
[310:27.87]Infiltrate the lounge.
[310:28.96]Save it!
[310:38.34]Okay.
[310:38.82]So, we're going to get up there.
[310:40.07]I could take one of the worker outfits, but not really necessary.
[310:45.93]At the moment, at least.
[310:47.23]Any other guards?
[310:49.59]There's a security camera.
[310:53.27]I don't have any fish.
[310:54.57]How am I supposed to do this?
[310:57.16]Thank God.
[311:05.16]Oh.
[311:07.69]If that was a fish, it would have happened.
[311:26.54]That's it you're mine God fucking damn it
[312:02.34]Alright, come here.
[312:15.83]I need a worker.
[312:17.91]Spaghetti sauce.
[312:19.35]Hey, look.
[312:19.67]What's that?
[312:20.19]Spaghetti.
[312:22.25]What?
[312:24.39]Shit.
[312:25.25]That scared the hell out of me.
[312:27.81]You should go see what it was.
[312:29.42]Yeah, know what it is.
[312:41.35]Something's going down over here.
[312:44.53]I'll be in touch.
[312:52.06]You need to come out ro- I- I hit Garot!
[312:56.81]Why?
[313:09.06]Groot.
[313:12.36]No, fuck this guy.
[313:13.30]I'm mad.
[313:16.90]I goroated this guy and then... Well, he would have been dead anyways.
[313:26.95]I pressed the goroat button and he... I don't know why they spin around.
[313:30.63]Oh.
[313:31.77]I have the can of peas still?
[313:33.47]No.
[313:34.28]I have to walk by, casually wait for it to show where it is, and then run by it.
[313:38.67]Okay, so I need to go... Where am I going?
[313:50.27]Up there.
[313:53.17]Amazing how Rangan managed to put together another epic, huh?
[313:57.53]I can't wait to see the results.
[313:59.25]It's a lot lighter than the first one he did.
[314:00.67]What was his goal?
[314:01.09]He's a believer.
[314:13.53]I thought I fell off.
[314:15.33]Okay.
[314:15.67]One more?
[314:16.79]One more, I guess.
[314:37.46]Hold on, watch out.
[314:39.82]Which way is that guy facing?
[314:40.76]Alright, we're good.
[314:50.64]So now... I don't have a keycard.
[315:10.15]Can I get in through this way?
[315:13.57]You can't see me through the bamboo, whatever this is.
[315:36.67]Bullseye.
[315:37.95]All right, let me go.
[315:39.71]Instead of that way, let's go over here.
[316:08.43]Does that guy work here?
[316:11.31]I need one of those secure... What's wrong?
[316:15.09]Oh, I guess I'm holding the... I got nothing.
[316:22.20]I'm fine.
[316:22.66]Everything's fine.
[316:24.04]Why are you wearing that?
[316:35.59]I can't get up.
[316:37.05]What?
[316:37.61]Okay, put the hammer down.
[317:06.87]Put the hammer down before I go in here.
[317:22.22]Alright.
[317:24.84]That guy can see through.
[317:27.56]There is a cannon over here.
[317:30.28]What is this giant thing?
[317:33.56]What is this?
[317:38.31]What was the movie set?
[317:43.36]What does it do?
[317:44.70]We got in trouble, mister.
[317:46.64]We don't like trouble here.
[317:48.58]I'm reporting this.
[317:56.66]So, can you blow somebody off?
[318:38.79]My brain gets too overstimulated when I play this game.
[318:41.98]Alright, drop this.
[318:44.24]Now, let me just... I need a different costume or something.
[318:48.04]There's so many people up here that know what I look like.
[318:50.74]I can't go that way.
[318:54.30]So, alright, this guy.
[318:55.24]What about this dude?
[319:02.10]Maybe I can go upstairs and come down?
[319:04.62]There's probably a scaffolding or something up here.
[319:06.24]Let's check.
[319:11.77]You gotta go that way.
[319:17.92]Oh, his is an office.
[319:23.18]Any other clothes in here?
[319:27.67]Is there nothing else in here?
[319:34.15]Barbara's razor.
[319:35.05]Alright, um...
[319:43.48]I wanna see... How do I get through there?
[319:45.35]This guy's just... I guess I could... Can I take your security?
[319:51.93]Come in here.
[319:52.63]You.
[319:52.81]I'm gonna hide in the shower.
[320:01.97]See if I can get this.
[320:05.41]I gotta kill somebody with the Mega Fan?
[320:06.89]I know, really.
[320:13.46]Did he say no?
[320:13.88]He said no.
[320:14.30]He said no.
[320:15.54]What are you...
[320:33.46]Oh, my God.
[320:33.80]That just kind of blew everything.
[320:35.24]Overflow Sink.
[321:12.01]Why is everyone coming in to investigate?
[321:18.56]Jesus Christ, what a mess.
[321:20.56]What a mess.
[321:25.22]Damn shit.
[321:26.33]Give me the hand here.
[321:33.21]Pardon me.
[321:33.91]Do you know what's up?
[321:34.71]Ah!
[321:44.65]I'm hunted.
[321:46.83]God fucking dammit.
[321:48.37]Why did the two of them just have to come in together?
[321:50.61]It's because I did two sinks.
[321:53.51]I did two sinks.
[321:55.39]So two people had to get- come in there?
[322:00.55]One sink and one guy will get called in.
[322:09.29]Two sinks, two people.
[322:13.07]Come on.
[322:22.52]Oh, just what I thought they were.
[322:23.84]Couldn't get any worse.
[322:26.98]All right, get him in here.
[322:36.89]What is it?
[322:38.49]It's the monster dungeon.
[322:39.93]The gate ring seems to have delivered them.
[322:42.79]Alright, give me your Uzi.
[322:46.51]Who's... What do you mean investigating?
[322:50.36]I did one sink, not two sinks.
[322:51.68]There was one sink.
[322:55.16]What the fuck?
[322:55.88]Why?
[322:56.02]I did one sink.
[322:56.50]Not two people.
[322:57.54]One sink.
[322:57.98]The one sink is still on.
[322:59.06]Well, they'll figure it out.
[322:59.90]Here we go, save it.
[323:17.33]Water's still going, but it's alright.
[323:19.65]We're gonna go straight through.
[323:21.68]How do you do?
[323:22.32]How do you do?
[323:22.90]Okay.
[323:23.44]So, where's the sniper?
[323:28.65]Sniper's right there.
[323:40.65]When are you gonna be done mixing those colors?
[323:42.33]I mean, how long can it take to smudge out a- So, am I gonna get myself shocked?
[323:47.93]70% of the work is finding the right colors.
[323:51.26]Missing tube of paint.
[323:52.72]I don't have that.
[323:55.74]Yeah, well, get a move on.
[323:57.44]Mr. Rongan wants you to go and get him as soon as you're done mixing your fancy colors there.
[324:01.40]You got it?
[324:01.98]Fine.
[324:11.67]I'm just trying to sit on the couch Organization I
[324:47.06]Oh my fucking god.
[324:47.76]Come on, shoot him.
[324:48.58]I need to find the paint.
[325:06.07]That's a great question where the hell that is though.
[325:07.77]Smash the other painting.
[325:08.57]Take the shot.
[325:09.05]Take the shot.
[325:09.61]I just can't do it.
[325:10.11]Why did I go?
[325:37.79]Wrong guy.
[325:38.33]I need to disguise as this guy, don't I?
[325:41.13]What are you talking about?
[325:44.89]Disguise yourself as the painter.
[325:49.21]So I need to get this guy disguised.
[325:55.20]So do I'm waiting for an opportunity.
[325:57.36]How am I supposed to... There's a guy in here!
[326:02.80]Like literally, I know.
[326:04.90]The marker is on this guy.
[326:10.64]I have to subdue him.
[326:22.12]I poisoned the champagne.
[326:23.36]I was hoping he was going to drink it.
[326:30.32]Like, the guy has a green marker on his back.
[326:34.33]You think I'm just sitting here like, I don't know who I need to fight here.
[326:38.47]Who could it possibly be?
[326:39.87]It just says there's a guy on a couch.
[326:41.71]This guy's not going to hear that.
[326:55.58]How do you not hear that?
[326:56.54]Am I getting shot?
[327:20.47]You guys don't actually think I didn't know it was this guy that I had to take the disguise of.
[327:26.12]I just was scared of this guy.
[327:27.89]I thought this guy was gonna hear anything.
[327:30.83]All right, let's go.
[327:31.67]I just have to f- Huh?
[327:54.56]All right, come on.
[327:55.06]I need you down.
[327:55.74]I need him.
[327:56.50]Where is he?
[327:56.80]Come on.
[328:16.46]Give me at least a little bit of credit.
[328:19.58]When the marker is on, they take the paint, whatever.
[328:22.48]It was on his body.
[328:23.22]Alright, work on the portrait.
[328:51.35]Have a good one, my friend.
[328:53.45]So who the heck is the maelstrom?
[328:57.69]Ah, beautiful.
[328:59.19]Good sharp today, sir.
[329:00.21]Magnificent use of colors and form.
[329:05.90]If the new piece catches my forceful nature like this, I will have nothing short of a masterpiece.
[329:13.12]Okay.
[329:13.74]I'll be the envy of everyone.
[329:16.00]There it is.
[329:16.96]A perfect execution, Mr. Rangel.
[329:19.38]All right.
[329:22.26]Let's get this done.
[329:28.44]I expect these to be the final brush strokes, Mr. Hussain.
[329:31.40]I'm a busy man here.
[329:47.50]You're not painting.
[329:48.42]Are you having a heart attack?
[329:49.96]Get on with it.
[329:57.77]Alright, 47.
[329:59.23]Let's see if the aim of our Kashmirian friend is true.
[330:03.79]Ah, yes.
[330:24.05]I know, I did a good job.
[330:25.31]Thank you.
[330:26.35]No, he's gonna drink the champagne.
[330:29.15]He's gonna drink the champagne.
[330:31.69]Oh, that's so lame.
[330:32.47]Oh, lame.
[330:52.96]Oh my god.
[330:54.82]Get outta here!
[330:58.15]Just standing in the way.
[331:13.98]I was thinking maybe he would shoot and he would shoot through my head.
[331:21.09]Alright, let's see the way it's supposed to be played out.
[331:26.21]Alright 47, let's see if the aim of our Kashmirian friend is true.
[331:32.42]Once the word gets out and my art-appreciating friends see it, your phone will be ringing off the hook.
[331:38.88]I can't wait.
[331:40.58]Hold your breath for a moment, Mr. Rangan.
[331:43.09]That's the reason I told you I wouldn't pay for the commission, by the way.
[331:46.49]Hold your breath.
[331:46.95]I'm not stingy.
[331:47.73]No, no, not at all.
[331:49.07]But if I'm already paying you in exposure, well, let's not overdo it, you know?
[331:56.19]I prefer cash over exposure.
[331:57.57]I prefer cash.
[331:59.34]Clench your fist, please.
[332:00.72]Clench your fist.
[332:01.74]Who doesn't?
[332:02.32]He's a pretty good painter.
[332:04.50]Exposure can be worth more than just money.
[332:07.42]Look at this.
[332:12.85]case it's the gift that keeps on giving just wait and see when you're done with this job the contracts will be rolling in that sounds wonderful mr ranger here it comes okay so look up a bit thank you that shot came from the tools it looks like the kashmirian finally got a clear line of fire okay darwood rangin is dead
[332:35.41]Just wait.
[332:36.25]Hold on a second.
[332:37.75]Maybe we had to activate that first.
[332:39.91]I just want to check.
[332:42.23]I want to see.
[332:43.05]I'm just curious.
[332:53.59]I want to just see if I can get you out in the head.
[332:58.27]Because if it activates, right?
[333:00.87]Just wait and see.
[333:01.67]Damn it!
[333:01.91]Earlier than that.
[333:02.91]One second earlier.
[333:03.61]I gotta literally just put it down.
[333:30.54]Right when he says his last line here.
[333:31.76]Okay, so you can't.
[333:32.44]You can't do it.
[333:33.64]It stops the whole thing.
[333:34.46]Oh well.
[333:35.43]Worth a try.
[333:59.81]Painter just does it.
[334:03.90]No fun allowed?
[334:04.86]I just wanna see.
[334:07.74]Still painting it.
[334:08.62]How long do I paint for?
[334:33.08]That's a great ending pose.
[334:44.63]Nice work.
[334:59.18]No, just leave him.
[334:59.86]Leave him.
[335:00.10]I'm done.
[335:01.34]Alright, so...
[335:04.27]Here's the real question.
[335:06.79]Where is the last bit of the Barber and the Maelstrom?
[335:14.49]Okay.
[335:15.77]Target already eliminated.
[335:16.90]Mission story complete.
[335:19.06]So I can do this Barber one.
[335:21.44]The Barber is tangled up in some shady business, 47.
[335:24.60]He may have seen a picture of the Maelstrom.
[335:27.98]Okay.
[335:35.71]Who found him?
[335:41.66]The guy that finally was going to do his job?
[335:43.38]Oh, we didn't get to blow somebody off here.
[335:51.50]Okay, we don't have time for this.
[335:52.48]This is for another day.
[335:57.72]We're going to go down here.
[336:00.76]Can I open this door?
[336:02.40]Yeah!
[336:24.58]Can I get down that?
[336:31.80]Come on.
[336:35.95]I can't get down this?
[336:38.25]Jump to ledge.
[336:39.03]No, come on.
[336:39.65]Really?
[336:47.84]Okay, what are you doing?
[336:55.64]It's gotta be... scaffolding right here.
[337:07.48]Jump?
[337:13.93]Oh, shit.
[337:14.57]You guys saw me, didn't you?
[337:15.51]I actually need to get the hell out of here.
[337:28.10]Maybe I can find stairs going down.
[337:29.79]Can I go down from here?
[337:33.35]Yeah.
[337:33.79]What the hell?
[337:44.31]I'm currently trespassing.
[337:45.81]Well, I made it out.
[337:46.89]This got seen by this fucking security tape.
[337:49.93]I'm just fucking running around in circles.
[338:14.62]I just wanted to get out.
[338:18.38]Well, I kinda- I made it out.
[338:19.80]Can I- I need to take their disguise.
[338:22.10]You're walking the set after all.
[338:24.42]I thought you said you would never be on one of Rangan's productions again.
[338:27.11]No, too close.
[338:27.69]Rupert, what can you do?
[338:29.15]I just hope this one actually makes it into the cinema.
[338:32.83]What am I doing?
[338:34.03]Stop it.
[338:34.59]Brick!
[338:39.95]Arishit!
[338:42.07]Could someone please get off their-
[338:52.80]Where am I?
[338:53.18]I just hit like a flash.
[338:54.72]Where am I?
[339:00.00]I'm streaming.
[339:00.60]Okay, I'm live.
[339:01.40]I'm currently live.
[339:02.66]What game am I playing?
[339:03.22]Okay, this is Hitman.
[339:05.28]Okay, good.
[339:21.19]And we are good to go.
[339:26.42]I just have to go across the whole thing.
[339:29.26]Down here, over this way, ayayay!
[339:31.96]Alright, crow's hideout.
[339:36.81]I need to probably be in a different costume.
[339:39.51]It's right up there.
[339:53.15]Blending into the crowd.
[339:53.85]I'm gonna blend in.
[339:54.41]Let's blend in the crowd for a little while.
[339:57.27]Currently blending.
[340:00.49]Chat's trying?
[340:02.41]What do you mean chat's really trying?
[340:05.37]What distraction?
[340:07.17]Investigating D'Souza's naked guy.
[340:15.20]Where did that guy vacuum?
[340:26.47]Alright.
[340:27.87]Get me up there.
[340:30.51]Slump Square.
[340:38.81]So, locate the crow's hideout.
[340:42.27]Here we are.
[340:43.33]Save it.
[340:50.89]He doesn't know that his webcam is on.
[340:53.09]My webcam is not on.
[340:57.58]Hey, best boy.
[340:58.42]You can't go this way.
[341:01.28]Okay.
[341:03.13]So I need... That's easy.
[341:12.68]Thanks.
[341:24.10]It's currently this way.
[341:25.34]Hold on.
[341:26.70]He doesn't come all the way over here, does he?
[341:28.28]Get a fish ready.
[341:31.37]I don't have one.
[341:32.47]It's alright, I got a razor.
[341:34.05]Wait, I have a barber's razor!
[341:35.15]I'm not gonna get rid of this.
[341:37.17]I think I might need this.
[341:41.59]Check my zipper.
[341:42.45]I don't have a zipper.
[341:53.23]Okay, so now from here... I've gotta go... That's where like the entrance is.
[342:00.69]I've gotta go down there.
[342:17.69]Almost there!
[342:23.10]There are the crows.
[342:29.43]Okay.
[342:31.87]How am I gonna... Save it!
[342:38.93]When's the last time I shaved?
[342:40.71]Like, maybe six or seven years ago.
[342:43.97]Thank you.
[342:44.81]Thank you.
[342:45.97]Thank you.
[342:46.43]Find the picture of the maelstrom.
[342:48.21]I don't know if this is what I wanted.
[342:50.74]Alright, find the picture of the maelstrom.
[343:33.12]What was that?
[343:33.98]I just- I killed him.
[343:37.20]I threw that really, really, really well apparently.
[343:39.98]Oh shit!
[343:49.14]Quick!
[343:49.96]Huh?
[343:53.56]No, no!
[343:56.54]You think you can just lob crap on me?
[344:08.05]Nothing in my position, sir.
[344:13.18]Who's got a key?
[344:16.70]I got nada here, man.
[344:19.92]Come on.
[344:21.56]I'm in the basement.
[344:24.38]Over.
[344:25.88]There's no picture of him in here.
[344:26.86]Oh, I'm gonna get electrocuted.
[344:33.14]What is all this?
[344:38.54]Okay, I mean, this is... Okay, the photo's over here.
[345:09.66]Found it.
[345:09.94]This guy's with a barber.
[345:10.94]Alright, time to get out of here.
[345:12.22]Let me take a look at the photo.
[345:13.30]Where is it?
[345:41.26]photo a note a recent picture of the maelstrom shown to the barber well okay why can I not see that hey get up all right so out this way the way we came who's that guy who's that guy who's that guy okay barber probably shouldn't walk in with a bunch of guns should I
[346:15.19]Probably not.
[346:26.57]Click!
[346:27.91]Click!
[346:31.05]Alright.
[346:34.35]Time to be the barber.
[346:35.19]I have the barber knife.
[346:39.19]Where is he?
[346:39.87]There we are.
[346:40.79]Hello!
[346:44.17]There are people waiting outside already.
[346:47.36]I can't remember what he looks like.
[346:49.46]The guy the crows wanted me to provide information to, you know?
[346:53.49]Oh, you mean me?
[346:54.69]They showed me his picture in their hideout two days ago.
[346:58.37]I was so stressed out.
[346:59.93]I thought they were going to kill me or something.
[347:01.71]I can't remember his face.
[347:02.91]Disguise yourself as the assassination target and then kill yourself.
[347:07.25]They probably still have the picture there.
[347:10.17]What if they hurt me?
[347:11.53]What will happen to you?
[347:12.79]Or if they decide to burn down the shop like they did with that other guy with the metal recycling?
[347:17.14]I won't do it.
[347:18.10]Bhavin, I told you we would get into trouble with this snitching business.
[347:22.26]But you had to go and earn some easy money sharing information with the gangs.
[347:26.04]This is your mess.
[347:31.68]I genuinely felt bad watching that.
[347:34.38]They're both still alive.
[348:01.37]Okay, we got... There's the knife.
[348:03.47]I have two of these now.
[348:04.51]I can dual-veil.
[348:07.47]Open the shop.
[348:09.85]I'm going to need the key to open the store.
[348:11.99]Alright, let's go open the store.
[348:30.89]I don't know what he looks like though.
[348:42.30]Open for business.
[348:42.98]I don't know what he looks like.
[348:46.68]I couldn't see.
[348:56.45]47?
[348:56.51]I tried to look at the... That man there.
[348:58.59]He resembles the Maelstrom.
[349:00.57]That man.
[349:00.89]Try to get close to him for a visual ID.
[349:06.64]Yes, finally!
[349:07.86]You have no idea how important this shave is to you.
[349:10.48]It looks like him, but that's not the Maelstrom.
[349:13.78]That wasn't him.
[349:14.86]No.
[349:16.47]Any chance for a shave today?
[349:17.71]I don't... Who's the Maelstrom?
[349:22.86]Cut!
[349:23.44]Is that him?
[349:23.90]Is that... No, that's the barber's store.
[349:26.50]Here's a recent picture, but I can't see it.
[349:57.67]Come on in, sir.
[349:58.99]Oh, hero.
[350:00.23]Don't mess this up, okay?
[350:02.01]The game's gonna tell you what... There, I just need to practice on somebody.
[350:10.37]That's not how you hold... Look at the fucking reflection.
[350:15.85]That's not how you hold a knife.
[350:17.05]Okay, tell me something.
[350:22.55]Did you hear about the new guy in town?
[350:31.60]Oh wait, he's in the chair.
[350:35.54]How do I get him out of the chair?
[350:37.66]Wait, he's just sleeping.
[350:46.76]My whole computer is crashing.
[350:56.31]Hello?
[351:05.37]Okay.
[351:06.65]Let's open this back up again.
[351:11.85]Hitman is currently downloading something.
[351:21.01]I'm downloading something.
[351:22.39]I don't know what it is.
[351:26.75]Okay.
[351:28.59]Welcome back.
[351:30.09]I guess.
[351:34.35]Dude, Hitman 3 just released!
[351:38.35]The update made me quit the game, I guess.
[351:41.07]Some reason.
[351:45.97]Because, yeah, Steam was just downloading another update for Hitman, and now... What is this doing?
[351:56.05]There we go, okay.
[351:58.61]Here we are.
[351:59.87]It plays the Batman music.
[352:01.31]That's how you know you're almost there.
[352:17.84]It happened to me too.
[352:23.48]Am I gonna dye my hair a new color?
[352:27.39]Why would I ever dye my hair?
[352:30.75]My hair is barely functioning.
[352:35.67]If I dye my hair, it ain't coming back.
[352:37.29]It's falling out.
[352:42.70]I'm not dying my hair.
[352:50.51]What is going on here?
[352:53.75]I don't... Don't ever ask me again.
[352:57.95]You've unlocked the unique aluminum travel briefcase.
[353:05.49]What... Where's my... Uh... Can I just load game?
[353:22.54]Yeah, it kicked me out to download a briefcase.
[353:24.34]Um, campaign.
[353:25.50]This is just where... Like, aren't I just back here?
[353:39.14]Load game.
[353:39.68]Okay.
[353:40.32]There it is.
[353:42.08]Um, where... Where was I?
[353:44.84]2048? 2048?
[353:50.00]2049, right here.
[353:51.90]I was about to open the shop.
[354:04.99]Uh, okay.
[354:06.91]You thought that was the PS4 home screen?
[354:08.67]No, that's the game menu.
[354:12.55]To shave everyone.
[354:14.13]Well, how am I gonna shave everybody?
[354:22.75]Here we go.
[354:23.07]Let's open up shop.
[354:26.72]I got my... I need my razor.
[354:29.38]Do I have one?
[354:33.54]Of course I do.
[354:35.91]Can I shave it?
[354:36.59]Somebody put, like, an iron.
[354:37.61]Alright, open this door.
[354:45.78]47 we're open for business.
[354:48.35]We know what the maelstrom looks like and expect him to show up Patience and shaving cream is what's on the menu now 47 not at this 47 sir that man there is he resembles the maelstrom Try to get close to him for a visual ID No, that wasn't him
[355:26.68]No.

[355:28.68]Alright, next customer, please.
[355:31.32]Uh...
[355:55.60]Which one of... Which one is the maelstrom?
[356:04.35]They both have the same, like, PAX badge on.
[356:07.33]Uh... Got it.
[356:29.55]Now I'll pick it up and get in the chair
[356:59.77]That's too bad.
[357:00.47]Okay, let's shave him.
[357:12.56]The tides are changing, my friend.
[357:14.84]Can you feel it in the air?
[357:17.09]My boat?
[357:17.67]Damn.
[357:18.89]Good work, my friend.
[357:20.15]This was an excellent experience.
[357:32.92]The infamous Maelstrom is... Alright, here.
[357:46.59]What is he?
[357:47.13]He's what?
[357:47.71]He is what?
[357:48.47]What is he?
[357:51.58]I really want him to pick it up.
[358:00.56]Here's the Maelstrom manifesto.
[358:02.00]Okay.
[358:02.16]Why do I have this?
[358:02.84]They still...
[358:30.61]Don't sneak up on me like that.
[358:31.79]Oh.
[358:41.94]Motivating.
[358:48.24]What?
[358:48.44]He just... He just Vulcan neck pinched me.
[358:54.61]Alright.
[358:54.97]Let's do it.
[359:09.56]Let's let him talk for a little bit Let him say his last piece.
[359:20.41]The tides are changing my friend.
[359:22.51]Can you feel it in the air?
[359:24.75]My bones are creaking with joy at the prospect of what is about to happen.
[359:28.77]I don't feel anything, I'm afraid.
[359:33.31]Well, friend, you have an important task ahead of you.
[359:37.51]Does he know?
[359:39.23]I sense that about you.
[359:40.43]Who's that?
[359:42.07]Together, we will all release the shackles that have bound us far too long and rise up against those who seek to keep us down.
[359:49.10]Just a knife, not even shaving cream.
[359:50.98]Whether those are our friends or foes, a day of reckoning is coming, is it not?
[360:01.86]I'm shaving his ear.
[360:02.72]Let me get that ear hair for you, sir.
[360:05.82]Is it hurt?
[360:06.32]We're done.
[360:29.76]The infamous Maelstrom is dead.
[360:32.72]Very well done, 47.
[360:34.82]Let's finish this one.
[360:37.20]Mission completed.
[360:38.52]Time to find an exit.
[360:41.04]He's like, oh no, I died.
[360:46.68]This is bad.
[360:47.65]Is he still alive?
[360:58.94]Hold on.
[360:59.38]I need to, like... Okay, he's dead.
[361:10.07]Time to leave.
[361:12.77]Hands and face.
[361:13.75]I can't believe... You know what?
[361:22.07]I can't save it here.
[361:24.17]You know what?
[361:24.47]Fuck you.
[361:24.99]You're up, sir.
[361:26.15]Ah, good.
[361:26.88]I...
[361:28.65]Bring in the fucking other one.
[361:30.49]Just in case it was a double.
[361:31.61]Just in case.
[361:36.45]Guys, don't you understand?
[361:45.69]Saddam Hussein had like 60 doubles.
[361:48.37]Right?
[361:48.85]Like... You can never be too sure.
[361:51.25]Doesn't like Kim Jong Un have like 40 doubles?
[362:01.85]How do I get out of here?
[362:08.91]I- I'm not even like a- I got like 12 doubles.
[362:54.20]The hands up saying I can't believe what happened to me.
[362:57.31]Hey complete.
[362:58.05]That was fun Broad strokes.
[363:00.85]You sure that was the right guy?
[363:03.27]Ghost.
[363:03.83]Showman.
[363:04.62]Queen.
[363:05.48]Straight shot.
[363:06.60]Tasteless.
[363:07.62]Someone could hurt themself.
[363:09.30]Madman.
[363:10.14]Mission.
[363:11.16]Open for business.
[363:12.12]The manual fan.
[363:12.90]Look at all these points.
[363:14.18]Broad strokes.
[363:14.94]Artists at work.
[363:15.60]Become the barber.
[363:16.64]Become the man.
[363:17.78]Become the tailor.
[363:18.68]Become the painter.
[363:20.26]All of my doubles doing all my work for me.
[363:22.90]Look at all my doubles.
[363:23.78]44,000.
[363:24.74]I got a zero.
[363:25.22]I got a zero.
[363:37.68]That's worse than a Yelp.
[363:39.20]Yelp reviews, you have to have at least a one.
[363:51.09]There's no such thing as a zero rating.
[363:52.39]Oh.
[364:05.37]German is downtown at a five-star restaurant with no reviews That's a brand new restaurant guys you have to you guys have to review me I Got the construction site rooftop beach washing stalls streets on the hill meat market homeless tent pottery market shoe shop old tire a new shotgun a
[364:34.52]A new silver... Oh, the silver ballers.
[364:36.06]There they are.
[364:39.43]There was no one to review your barbershop.
[364:42.39]I see a remote explosive.
[364:45.09]The barge.
[364:46.13]The boat.
[364:47.07]The chawls.
[364:47.98]The laundry.
[364:48.80]The skywalk.
[364:49.54]The taxi.
[364:50.52]The train.
[364:52.70]So I did both of these.
[364:54.66]This is the only one I did not do.
[364:55.74]This is probably the one with the fence.
[365:04.67]Bard Simpson.
[365:08.98]That was fucking fun.
[365:09.66]All right, I think, I think I'm gonna call it there tonight.
[365:21.93]Because... I'll tell you the reason why.
[365:23.73]Acidic.
[365:23.93]One more freeze-frame cutscene and we'll talk about it.
[365:25.83]Oh, here comes the ending the stream voice, oh no.
[365:27.57]CRYPTO!
[365:28.01]Bitcoin?
[365:28.69]Ethereum?
[365:51.99]It's the haunted house mission?
[365:54.11]So we have to do the haunted house mission.
[366:21.59]You came home.
[366:24.87]I knew you would.
[366:27.81]My son.
[366:28.43]You've come a long way, 47.
[366:31.99]And even now, you don't remember your own father.
[366:38.16]This place.
[366:39.62]This was our prison, where father trained us, shaped us into killers for Providence.
[366:45.42]You don't remember.
[366:46.30]They ripped it out of you, wiped it away, but I do.
[366:49.59]What do we say, Troy Baker?
[366:50.63]I remember everything.
[367:04.11]You're a terrorist with nothing to lose.
[367:06.85]You'd say anything.
[367:20.62]I know it's difficult.
[367:22.12]You never miss your mark or question your function.
[367:25.88]But we made a pact.
[367:27.70]You and I. What are you talking about?
[367:31.55]Do this, and we both lose.
[367:36.55]There was an incident.
[367:39.29]That boy, he died.
[367:42.23]He lived.
[367:44.69]Because of you.
[367:46.76]Is it me?
[367:47.48]It's me, right?
[367:49.02]So this is not me.
[367:53.08]What was his name?
[367:57.28]Subject 6.
[367:59.74]Your name is Subject 6.
[368:03.62]And what is our purpose?
[368:07.84]To take them all down.
[368:11.45]A man chooses.
[368:15.99]A man chooses.
[368:18.63]Okay.
[368:28.66]Let me see that birth certificate.
[368:30.17]I don't believe that Subject 6 is your name.
[368:32.11]It's definitely Larry.
[368:36.54]Alright.
[368:37.94]So, everybody, the reason why we're gonna shut up here is because that was three areas.
[368:46.93]Just over six hours here.
[368:49.23]So, uh, so tomorrow, by the way, tomorrow, the green screen's not tomorrow, the green screen is gonna be Friday.
[368:55.32]So tomorrow, we're gonna pick up exactly at this moment right here exactly.
[369:01.24]Halfway.
[369:02.76]So, if it's been about, you know, we've been fucking around a little bit, we've been doing some story missions, we've figured six hours, six hours, six hours, seven hours, something like that, at the halfway point here.
[369:16.35]So, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[369:19.19]Probably around the same time.
[369:21.48]Around 5 to 6 p.m.
[369:23.68]Eastern.
[369:25.24]2, 3 p.m.
[369:26.36]maybe Pacific.
[369:29.07]The green screen is not tomorrow.
[369:30.21]Why not tomorrow?
[369:31.64]Because I'd rather put it on Friday where more people could probably watch.
[369:40.40]And with that, thanks for sticking around.
[369:42.68]I had a lot of fun.
[369:43.36]This game's as hilarious and amazing as I expected it to be.
[369:48.52]So, it's just more of the... If you liked Hitman from a couple years ago, they just did more.
[369:56.18]It's just more stuff.
[369:57.12]It's just more missions.
[369:58.86]And more scenarios.
[370:01.40]Which is kind of what everybody wanted in the first place.
[370:03.98]So... It's good.
[370:10.51]Anyways, I'll see you guys soon.
[370:12.65]See you tomorrow.
[370:14.92]And I'm gonna hit the escape button.
[370:16.88]And I'm gonna exit to menu.
[370:18.84]And then I'm gonna put up this thing.
[370:24.01]And we'll do the bits.
[370:27.59]Plus, there's other things to do.
[370:28.73]Maybe we'll do two more streams of this game.
[370:32.71]I would assume there's still lots to do.
[370:36.30]So, it's not like I'm going to blow through all the story missions and never do anything else.
[370:40.20]So, we'll do probably three streams of Hitman.
[370:43.29]Tomorrow we'll complete the story missions.
[370:44.97]We'll go through the areas.
[370:48.57]And after that, we'll see.
[370:53.13]But anyways, let us go back to way earlier this evening.
[370:59.75]If you're taking off, see you soon.
[371:02.81]And if you're sticking around,
[371:04.52]Hey, thanks.
[371:05.70]Elizabeth, thanks for the $1.
[371:06.56]Well, that was yesterday, but thank you anyways.
[371:10.55]Thank you also to... Six hours ago here.
[371:13.21]Here we go.
[371:15.53]Zolnog.
[371:17.27]Thank you, Zolnog, for the $1,000.
[371:19.13]The $10.
[371:20.55]$10 here.
[371:23.96]Appreciate it, Zol.
[371:26.30]That was the first bit that came in.
[371:29.66]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $1. $1.
[371:32.24]Hey Jerm, I just wanted to say thanks.
[371:33.86]I say how much I love what you do.
[371:34.98]Also, I've been having trouble lately with job troubles.
[371:38.70]Like I don't have one right now and I want to make a career out of voice acting.
[371:41.92]And it's harder than I thought, but it's what I love.
[371:43.72]And I also love what you do.
[371:46.13]I really hope I can be successful.
[371:47.43]I keep having doubts about it just because I feel pathetic not having a shitty part-time job right now.
[371:52.53]Hope I can do what I've always wanted to do.
[371:54.01]Thanks.
[371:56.13]My best advice I can give you is...
[372:00.83]Always have... Always have two or three things you're interested in.
[372:05.99]That you like, that you care about.
[372:08.66]So you have things that you're always cool doing.
[372:11.40]You know what I mean?
[372:12.82]Have, like, at least two or three passions.
[372:15.24]Things that you really love.
[372:16.72]So then if one works out and the other two don't, then you're still doing something that you really like to do.
[372:22.57]Right?
[372:24.49]Voice acting is... It's a tough gig.
[372:26.13]It's a hard business to get into.
[372:28.33]It's...
[372:30.81]I've been kind of out of it for a long time, but the best resources available for you, you just have to kind of work on a demo, get out there, try to put yourself into online cartoons, try to audition for online cartoons.
[372:46.93]They still do them.
[372:48.60]That's what I did.
[372:51.16]And make sure you have three things that you like to do, because you'll never be disappointed.
[372:57.25]I think a lot of times people just have the one thing that they want to do.
[373:01.44]One thing.
[373:02.68]And they go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it.
[373:05.36]And if it doesn't work out, it's like, oh, well, fuck, man, that didn't work out.
[373:08.33]But if you still have other things that you know that you like, you won't feel that way.
[373:15.25]I knew, here's the three things that I've always, always wanted to do.
[373:19.73]One, I love computers.
[373:22.93]I've always wanted to be somewhere in the field of computers, whether it's with customer support with computer software or, and this is by the way, this is before even like I started college.
[373:33.36]So I would have obviously done more into this if I did.
[373:37.20]Love computers, love animals.
[373:40.32]I volunteered at an animal shelter for like just over a year, just maybe it was like 11 months, 12 months or something.
[373:46.59]I really wanted to work with animals because I fucking love animals.
[373:49.39]I love dogs, like a veterinary, vet tech or something like that is something that I always like, I would be completely fine with doing, you know what I mean?
[373:57.70]Then there was like voice acting and videos and big comedy shit.
[374:02.22]You know what I mean?
[374:02.70]Like that was another thing.
[374:04.70]Try to spread out your passions.
[374:06.92]That way you're never disappointed.
[374:14.67]Your computer breaks every other stream.
[374:16.39]You made the right choice not going into it.
[374:18.77]Well, but that's what I mean.
[374:19.75]Like, but that's something I wanted to do.
[374:26.87]Just because my computer breaks doesn't mean I... What does that even... Components break.
[374:32.45]My RAM died.
[374:33.45]A stick of RAM died.
[374:34.35]That's not because I peed on it.
[374:38.86]But that's really the best advice I can give.
[374:41.52]I wish you the best of luck.
[374:43.52]Hopefully you end up doing something that you like to do.
[374:47.96]Good luck to you.
[374:50.22]DivUSP, thanks for the three bucks.
[374:53.03]No message, thank you.
[374:54.93]For the three dollars.
[374:57.60]Uh, after Smath, thanks to the $1- Hey, Jerma, I can't wait to play this.
[375:02.28]The last one was a blast.
[375:03.70]By the way, I finished building my new $700 computer about a month ago, and it's a bit better than my $150 Staples laptop.
[375:12.20]See?
[375:13.32]Computers!
[375:14.50]Also, I've been studying you for a school project.
[375:16.96]I don't want to give anything away, but the end result's going to be interesting.
[375:19.52]Can't wait for the green screen scream.
[375:21.98]They actually did write scream, so... The green screen scream.
[375:27.73]Well, looking forward to that project.
[375:29.33]Hopefully it doesn't get you in trouble.
[375:31.43]Hopefully it's school appropriate.
[375:33.77]But thank you.
[375:36.41]It's a great game, by the way.
[375:38.13]Bake me home.
[375:38.73]Thanks for the $5.
[375:39.89]Can't play Hitman 2 because my PC is a piece of shit, but I played some of Miami before the frame drops became too much.
[375:46.00]Hitman 2016 was my game of the year.
[375:47.84]Enjoy the sequel.
[375:50.64]This is going to be rough for the end of this year.
[375:53.80]Because there's been at least... There's been a lot of... At least top five, at least top six maybe games.
[376:00.33]Hitman... I feel like, ah, it's Hitman again.
[376:05.83]But... It very well could be.
[376:13.54]It just... It's everything that I want in a video game.
[376:17.30]The only thing it does not have is cars.
[376:20.89]If you could drive around in Hitman, actually just commandeer vehicles and drive around, and it was like an actual, like, open, open world game with vehicles, I don't think you would ever make another video game that I would ever play ever again.
[376:35.79]That's the only game I would play.
[376:37.00]I would only play that game.
[376:40.84]It would go up a letter grade to an S.
[376:46.07]Spider-Man was also one of the best games of the year for sure.
[376:52.61]Red Dead 2 is so good.
[376:56.05]There's been a lot of great releases.
[377:02.33]But yeah, thank you Bake Me Home.
[377:03.81]Thanks for the $5.
[377:05.57]Extra cheesy thanks to the $14 extra cheesy.
[377:10.24]Disguise yourself as a race car and stab him in the ass when he sits on you.
[377:21.22]Holy shit.
[377:21.80]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[377:23.82]Thanks for the 14 bucks, man.
[377:27.24]There's a dog.
[377:29.22]Hey, Keddie.
[377:29.90]Thanks for the $1, Keddie.
[377:31.52]They say, huh?
[377:34.52]I don't know what... I don't know, huh?
[377:37.94]That is Otto.
[377:39.94]What's he doing down there?
[377:45.22]Kim is probably... Yeah, that's probably Kim.
[377:50.42]Yeah.
[377:51.14]It's probably Kim.
[377:52.58]She was probably going in and out.
[377:55.10]Okay, cool.
[377:56.14]FurtBernandez, thank you for your 10 community subs.
[378:00.78]Earlier.
[378:01.50]Thank you so much.
[378:02.20]It's very generous of you.
[378:08.89]SwiggityDank, thanks for the $5.
[378:13.83]Ben... Ben Shepero just roasted the shit out of my class.
[378:21.80]What?
[378:25.77]What are you talking about?
[378:37.03]Abort.
[378:37.45]Abort.
[378:39.19]Stop reading.
[378:45.66]Oh.
[378:47.54]I don't even know what that is, but thanks for the five dollars.
[378:56.41]How do you not know how to pronounce it, Shapiro?
[379:02.24]I don't know, I have just... You better off, he's innocent, leave him out of this.
[379:10.72]Me?
[379:11.02]Alright, I'm just gonna move on because I have no idea what's going on.
[379:16.18]So, thank you though.
[379:18.40]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.00.
[379:20.06]Jerma, I kind of hate you right now.
[379:22.08]There's an errand I need to run this week, but you keep going live right before I'm about to leave, and now I'm never gonna get it done.
[379:27.74]Do it right now!
[379:30.40]Or do it right when you wake up.
[379:36.18]But, I'm sorry.
[379:37.30]Thank you, MostlyLost.
[379:39.64]Thank you, MajorBluetooth, for the $7.00, MajorBluetooth.
[379:43.42]Anecdotal!
[379:43.70]Anecdotal!
[380:11.81]He knows you from the servers.
[380:13.97]Hey, if anybody knows me from the servers, uh, yeah, hi.
[380:20.63]He must have found him on the servers.
[380:23.21]Thank you, holeofonezombie, for the two bucks.
[380:25.03]I have a bug on my Twitch app on my tablet that makes your voice go high-pitched.
[380:30.68]What's stranger is it made Vinny's really low.
[380:35.68]That is really weird.
[380:38.84]Why?
[380:39.16]Why?
[380:42.49]He knows you from... Thank you, Holobunzombie.
[380:45.83]Thank you, MarsGamingYT, for the $1.
[380:47.73]Ghost... Alright, what the fuck?
[380:53.22]I can't read that, but like... Alright, thank you, MarsGaming, for the $1.
[381:00.20]FractalSwordMan.
[381:01.44]FractalSwordsMan.
[381:02.72]Thanks for the $5, Fractal.
[381:05.10]This is for last night's stream.
[381:06.86]I had to hand over my pet snake to a friend before I left...
[381:10.81]On my couple month business trip, your stream helped with getting me to laugh so damn hard.
[381:16.46]Thanks, man.
[381:17.24]German TV, German heart.
[381:20.25]Pet snake?
[381:20.79]What kind?
[381:21.09]How big?
[381:21.65]What kind of snake?
[381:23.83]Just a little... Just a little guy or a big one like a boa?
[381:40.93]Football Python.
[381:44.09]Is that a huge snake?
[381:48.82]Damn.
[381:58.83]Trying to see what the consensus here is with how large it is.
[382:03.91]I enjoyed my stay night.
[382:05.53]Well, thanks for coming out morning.
[382:07.69]Morning, OW.
[382:08.49]Thank you.
[382:10.44]No, they can be small.
[382:11.53]Oh, okay.
[382:14.11]That's cool.
[382:16.09]Glad you're having fun.
[382:17.59]Thank you so much for the $5, dude.
[382:22.11]PlankV2, thanks for the $1.
[382:25.13]Appreciate it.
[382:25.60]They say pride.
[382:27.42]Thank you.
[382:29.20]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the $1.
[382:32.00]It's the most Garfield time of the year with the Garf jingle bells and all the chat giving Jerma 100-bit cheers.
[382:38.22]It's the Garfgarfiest stream of all.
[382:40.46]Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas, Jerma.
[382:42.91]I'm wrapping your present as we speak.
[382:44.39]Jerma, old friend, it's a big thank you for all your years of work just to make us all laugh.
[382:49.33]Hey, don't peek at your present, then it won't be a surprise.
[382:52.86]Uh, Otto, keep your human on a leash.
[382:55.22]I'm just kidding with you, Jerma, or joining you if you're still Garfield-themed.
[383:04.34]Thank you.
[383:05.20]Thank you, Toop Cholo Graham, for the one dollar.
[383:12.95]Get BT TV, you psycho.
[383:24.26]I... That's not default though.
[383:27.46]I need default.
[383:31.67]You said my name wrong.
[383:33.27]What the fu- It's the capitalization.
[383:37.03]There's no capitalization over here on Streamlabs, so it's just 2pachologram.
[383:46.98]I don't know why it's like that on Streamlabs.
[383:55.22]Vttv has capitalization, but does it work with Streamlabs?
[384:00.83]He doesn't have Adblock either.
[384:01.99]No, I don't.
[384:05.04]I do not have Adblock.
[384:07.50]Although I think it's like built, isn't it like baked into Firefox?
[384:12.34]I think it might be.
[384:13.46]But anyways, thank you so much, man.
[384:15.44]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[384:17.34]Here's something I made because of the steal the China moment last night.
[384:25.80]Steal the China.
[384:27.54]Steal the China.
[384:28.97]Steal the China.
[384:36.91]Thanks a lot.
[384:44.66]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[384:46.44]Thank you, Corbett.
[384:47.68]Thank you, Corbett, for the $1.50.
[384:49.02]Hey, German, my evening class was cancelled because my state is burning.
[384:55.14]Oh, God.
[384:57.21]Glad I was able to catch a Wednesday stream.
[385:01.05]Hopefully you're safe.
[385:06.77]Best of luck to you.
[385:08.99]Stay safe, for sure.
[385:15.70]Uh, thanks for the $1.50.
[385:16.92]Thanks for hanging out.
[385:22.52]Thank you, uh, to Pachalogram again for the $1.00.
[385:25.21]You were boss baby the whole time.
[385:29.65]I know I'm gonna call you that now forever.
[385:31.01]That's just the way it is.
[385:39.42]The air quality in LA has been awful recently.
[385:42.88]Yes, those fires, man.
[385:45.62]It's just not fucking cool.
[385:51.21]I'm safe.
[385:52.05]I live 70 miles away from the closest fire.
[385:54.27]Things are being closed because of the smoke, I see.
[385:57.53]But still, just be careful.
[386:03.07]But, thank you, Corbett.
[386:06.45]And thank you to Bet3 for $10.
[386:09.53]$10 coming in from Bet3.
[386:12.63]Might not be able to catch the green screen stream on Friday since it's my 19th birthday.
[386:17.05]But I look forward to watching the VOD.
[386:19.27]Just want to say I admire your view on life so much.
[386:21.39]I hope one day I can do something for a living that I enjoy while making other people happy as well.
[386:25.66]Thanks for all the good times.
[386:28.40]Thank you, Bet3.
[386:30.38]Happy birthday.
[386:31.72]Happy 19th birthday.
[386:33.48]Coming soon here.
[386:36.44]Uh, I hope you think it's fun.
[386:37.98]It should be... I think it's gonna be funny.
[386:40.70]I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[386:42.70]Especially a few weeks later.
[386:45.04]When we get to see the real fruits of everybody's labor, so... Much love to you.
[386:50.08]Happy birthday.
[386:50.76]Thank you for the $10.
[386:53.70]And then finally here at the end, thank you, uh... Granola Grimm for the $1.
[386:57.71]Hey, Jerma, thanks for an awesome Wednesday night of entertainment.
[386:59.83]Thank you, Granola.
[387:02.21]Glad you had fun.
[387:03.55]If you're around tomorrow, maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
[387:10.82]Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
[387:13.06]And let's let the credits scroll on by of all the subs and resubs.
[387:19.20]They should be making their way by right now.
[387:22.16]What's tomorrow?
[387:22.74]More Hitman.
[387:23.48]We got halfway through.
[387:25.10]So we're going to go from the halfway point probably to the end.
[387:31.10]And see where we are after that because then the day after that is green screen.
[387:37.51]Unless anything major happens, which I don't think it will.
[387:40.55]If there's some kind of technical problem where I have to push it to Saturday, I don't think I will, though.
[387:45.54]I think it's pretty locked in that it's gonna happen Friday.
[387:47.50]Have you been following the Hitman 2 story?
[387:58.00]Yes, I guess a little.
[387:59.72]A little.
[388:03.37]Make it a Star Wars scroll.
[388:06.39]What do I think of Hitman 2 so far?
[388:07.64]I think it's great.
[388:09.92]I think it is... Summarize it.
[388:16.74]So... Last game... The bad guy... Was actually your... Like a... Shared bunk beds with you.
[388:30.13]And you're both subjects of an assassin program and Diana...
[388:36.29]Um... Diana's, uh... Wait, I don't want to spoil it, but Diana had an issue.
[388:41.64]Something happened to Diana when she was younger.
[388:43.16]That's it.
[388:48.34]That's all I know.
[388:57.16]Yeah, pretty much, you got two opposing forces.
[388:59.48]You know, you got a red and a blue.
[389:01.44]And, you know, there's a thing, there's an entity.
[389:03.76]It's a big circle.
[389:08.42]Spoiler, now I know something happens with Di- Diana's in every single one of these games.
[389:15.10]They're in every- she's in every game.
[389:25.32]Spark notes for Hitman 2.
[389:29.77]But for real, thank you all you guys here.
[389:33.35]All the resubs, all the new subs.
[389:36.99]Spoilers, we know she's in the game.
[389:46.06]Except for most of Absolution.
[389:47.62]We don't talk about Absolution.
[389:50.34]Absolution really is such a weird game because it sits right in the middle of the absolute perfection of video games.
[390:01.12]You know what I mean?
[390:02.22]You've got, like, the first few hitbands were just, you know, genre-defining pieces of video game media, right?
[390:10.55]And then you have Absolution, which was just, what the hell is this?
[390:16.69]It was, like, good, but it was, like, an action game.
[390:19.05]It was, it was kind of linear.
[390:20.41]And then you got, like, these two, which are fucking fantastic.
[390:28.06]Absolution is a fine game, but it's just that like it just doesn't it just sits right in the middle in a weird place in Hitman lore and a Hitman gameplay Because the thing that predated And I think that succeeds it it's just so much better it's just odd I
[390:56.98]But, I will see you tomorrow.
[390:58.28]We will talk more about Hitman because we're going to play it again tomorrow.
[391:03.98]Is Absolution a good starting game?
[391:05.82]No.
[391:07.18]I think you should only play Absolution if you really, really love Hitman and it's one of your favorite franchises.
[391:14.45]If you want to start somewhere, I mean, just start with Hitman from 2016.
[391:18.83]You'll get... Or Hitman 2...
[391:30.91]I would just start with the one that came out in 2016.
[391:36.75]Blood Money is the best one so far, or the best one in that, originals.
[391:40.81]Yeah, it is, but I would just start with, just get a good taste of it, start with the best.
[391:46.11]You can play Blood Money on browser.
[391:57.26]That's kind of weird.
[391:59.81]But with that, see y'all tomorrow.
[392:03.59]Have a great rest of your night.
[392:05.22]Take care.
[392:07.02]Sleep well.
[392:08.40]Goodbye.
