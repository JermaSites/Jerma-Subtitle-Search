[00:01.31]Hey.
[00:03.79]Sorry.
[00:04.73]Hi, guys.
[00:09.56]What a great way to start.
[00:12.24]Make a lot of fucking gross noises.
[00:15.90]But hello.
[00:18.52]Sorry, I was doing something that required my attention.
[00:22.35]But still started on time at 2 p.m.
[00:25.07]right before 2.
[00:26.43]158 exactly, I think it was.
[00:29.41]Don't have to stream for 24 hours, because as you see, if you type in the new emote... I told you that when the stream started today, if there wasn't that emote there, that I would have to do a 24-hour stream, but thankfully, look at that, it's there.
[00:52.17]By the way, I don't know what to title this stream, because what the hell else do you title this?
[00:56.85]We're going to play Darkwood.
[00:57.78]It's October.
[01:00.48]There's been a lot of requests to play this game.
[01:02.18]I don't know why.
[01:03.46]Is it scary?
[01:04.70]Is it weird?
[01:05.34]Is it intense?
[01:06.54]I don't know.
[01:09.89]I have no idea.
[01:11.53]But what am I right?
[01:12.43]It's Darkwood.
[01:14.87]Should I just title the game the name MonkaS?
[01:24.36]No.
[01:24.72]It's too easy.
[01:32.58]Hold on.
[01:33.78]Yeah, if you have any horror game suggestions that I have not played, throw it in the recommended channel.
[01:39.11]I'll take a look at them because it is October.
[01:40.93]So, I mean, right.
[01:43.87]It's Darkwood.
[01:48.03]I was going to write, like, into the Darkwood, but that's too easy, too.
[01:53.60]That's simple.
[01:56.70]Sometimes it just has to be what you're doing.
[02:04.95]Dead Rising.
[02:05.63]Alright, let me make a tweet.
[02:10.30]I'll be back in like 40 minutes.
[02:12.58]Just making a tweet.
[02:29.54]I see a lot of, yes, yes, this game is so good.
[02:31.96]Yes, this game is so good.
[02:33.54]Is it really?
[02:34.86]Is it good?
[02:40.59]Am I going to like this game?
[02:41.97]Or is this going to be one of those scenarios where I'm just like... I don't fucking get it.
[02:45.39]That's just fucking stupid.
[02:46.23]It's that fucking dumb game.
[02:47.35]I don't fucking like this.
[02:50.75]Find out.
[02:54.57]But, yeah, let's go.
[02:57.57]Enjoy the new emote.
[02:59.74]There's a couple of scenarios where you should be using it, by the way.
[03:03.47]Really, I think only one or two scenarios where that emote makes any sense.
[03:08.33]One is if I taste or smell something gross on stream.
[03:13.57]Or if you hear this sound.
[03:19.00]That's pretty much the only reason why I would be on.
[03:26.88]You can't even hear this.
[03:36.66]So if you hear a vacuum cleaner on stream, if it's in a game, what a perfect opportunity.
[03:42.52]Or if I'm like... That's it.
[03:45.96]Don't use it anywhere else.
[03:47.24]Or I'll get rid of it.
[03:47.80]Alright, let's go.
[03:49.52]Let's do Darkwood.
[03:51.16]Funny thing about this game, I actually downloaded this game a long time ago, apparently.
[03:55.81]And have... 7 minutes of playtime in this game.
[04:00.59]I don't know how.
[04:01.13]I don't know when or why.
[04:08.43]Did I open it and go, nah?
[04:09.75]I mean, that's as long as it is to do the options in your video settings.
[04:23.58]Dermot, don't do this.
[04:27.06]Turn on face cam.
[04:28.34]Alright, if you're good.
[04:32.35]Not a blind stream?
[04:33.43]Well, the menu is maybe not blind.
[04:37.23]Turn on cam.
[04:39.29]If you're good.
[04:43.79]Alright, play.
[04:44.37]What if I... Imagine if I hit play, and I didn't know that you guys could see that there was a save game that has, like, seven hours of playtime, and I've just been fucking lying that I never played it.
[04:55.20]Thank God!
[04:57.02]That was close.
[05:00.58]There's, like, four different save slots, all with, like, 20 hours of game time in it.
[05:05.81]Facecam.
[05:06.79]You'll get a facecam if you're good!
[05:11.86]Difficulty.
[05:12.38]Normal.
[05:12.70]The forgiving mode.
[05:13.36]When dying, you drop part of your equipment.
[05:15.02]No!
[05:15.82]The unforgiving mode.
[05:16.68]You have a limited number of lives.
[05:18.02]After that, it's game over.
[05:18.96]No!
[05:19.94]The ultimate thrill.
[05:20.76]Death is permanent.
[05:21.62]No!
[05:22.54]Oh, there's no easy.
[05:25.32]Indiegogo content.
[05:29.78]This option enables additional cool but immersion-breaking content.
[05:34.59]I don't want that.
[05:38.08]Does that mean Thomas the Tank Engine is going to be in the game and draw a mod or something?
[05:42.20]I don't want that.
[05:43.24]Skip the prologue.
[05:45.01]No, don't skip the prologue.
[05:46.63]Normal difficulty.
[05:52.95]Okay.
[05:54.45]I don't want to break my immersion.
[05:55.53]I'm going to get super locked into this.
[05:59.27]Alright, you ready?
[06:01.29]You'll get this if you're good.
[06:10.02]Why is it glitching out?
[06:12.36]Alright, you'll get this if you're good.
[06:20.28]Is he wearing Aquaman?
[06:21.30]Yep.
[06:23.09]Alright, I'm not putting both headphones in.
[06:26.13]You're playing a challenging and unforgiving game.
[06:28.25]You will not be led by the hand.
[06:30.17]Respect the woods, be patient, and focus.
[06:32.99]Okay, so backseating is allowed in this stream.
[06:36.72]Those of you that, backseating is okay.
[06:40.24]I'm going to give you a phrase.
[06:41.58]If I use this phrase, that means tell me the answer, okay?
[06:44.58]I'm going to look into the chat and I'm going to say, please tell me the answer.
[06:49.09]And that's all that needs to happen.
[06:51.43]Backseating is completely allowed.
[06:52.81]I encourage it, actually.
[06:54.31]You're not going to read a challenging, unforgiving game like that and then, I don't know.
[06:59.14]I'm going to focus, but if I want the answers, I'm going to get them.
[07:05.48]I don't even know what's on this coffee cup.
[07:06.78]Prologue.
[07:07.40]Quiet.
[07:09.16]You've been good enough.
[07:09.78]You'll get the face cam for five minutes, then it's going off.
[07:16.00]I see hatred and fear in their eyes.
[07:27.37]As if I was responsible for spreading... for the spreading disease.
[07:30.93]Okay, this is an illness.
[07:31.89]This is a disease.
[07:34.30]There's a disease.
[07:36.72]As if I were the source of all the misery plaguing this land.
[07:39.60]Alright.
[07:48.42]I have nowhere to hide from them, nowhere to run.
[07:50.47]The woods have closed us off from the outside world.
[07:53.31]Give me the solution to the first puzzle.
[07:55.31]I want pre-backseat gaming.
[08:01.79]We are all doomed.
[08:08.75]Somebody just wrote, go left.
[08:18.04]Alcohol distiller.
[08:18.86]Is this like Hotline Miami?
[08:24.29]Table, search.
[08:26.59]Pill.
[08:27.27]You can have 30 pills.
[08:30.05]Is this my inventory?
[08:32.48]Notepad.
[08:32.94]My old notepad.
[08:33.94]Examine it.
[08:37.14]Nothing interesting apparently happening.
[08:41.68]Nothing on here.
[08:42.22]There's no secrets?
[08:42.86]There's no clues on here?
[08:44.19]Okay.
[08:50.43]Chair.
[08:51.23]Drag the chair.
[08:54.05]Alright, I'm going to block the door.
[08:54.97]In case anybody comes in.
[09:00.41]Alright, alcohol distiller.
[09:01.47]A homemade device for producing moonshine.
[09:06.47]The audio's too low.
[09:08.05]Is the audio too low?
[09:09.29]Hold on, let me help you out here.
[09:14.79]That's probably better.
[09:17.62]How's that?
[09:19.50]Better?
[09:21.44]I think so.
[09:22.34]A homemade device for producing moon- Okay, I don't have any moonshine.
[09:24.68]That's my health bar and my stamina bar.
[09:27.52]Do it louder than this.
[09:29.31]Yeah, but it's a scary game.
[09:30.35]I don't want it to be that loud.
[09:33.91]No, I know where it is.
[09:35.03]Apply these, yeah.
[09:35.71]Hold on.
[09:38.74]Hold on.
[09:40.76]Everybody wants it to be loud when like the monster jumps through the fucking window.
[09:43.90]I get it.
[09:45.80]There you go.
[09:46.30]There's your immersion.
[09:47.48]It's gonna be loud and scary.
[09:51.32]Okay, that's good.
[09:53.85]Somebody think of a title, by the way, while I do this.
[09:57.55]Better?
[09:57.75]Okay.
[10:00.63]Wooden door open.
[10:01.63]Is there a sprint?
[10:02.29]There is.
[10:03.01]It takes... What is that?
[10:04.07]It takes stamina.
[10:05.11]Barricaded window.
[10:06.70]Dismantling this now would be suicide.
[10:10.45]Alright, okay, so this is a post-apocalyptic zombie world.
[10:17.83]Potatoes.
[10:19.31]The only edible thing growing on this land, I still have some left.
[10:24.13]What am I doing?
[10:24.53]What am I doing?
[10:24.91]What am I doing?
[10:25.37]What am I doing?
[10:27.24]Why am I tying my shoes?
[10:32.93]Oh, God.
[10:34.65]This generator is almost out of juice.
[10:36.13]I need to find a full gasoline can.
[10:39.19]I saw a broken tractor to the east.
[10:41.94]Maybe I could find some gasoline there.
[10:45.12]Go left.
[10:45.76]Thanks for the tip.
[10:46.42]Appreciate that.
[10:52.64]Nothing in the cages.
[10:53.64]This time, they're empty.
[10:58.71]Nothing in the cage.
[11:00.47]No, I just have some pills.
[11:02.91]Chair.
[11:03.89]What the fuck?
[11:04.65]My old Zenit camera.
[11:10.48]Can I spin it around or something?
[11:12.58]Can I take it with me?
[11:14.68]My old useless medical bag.
[11:18.56]It's a bag.
[11:19.10]It's not useless.
[11:19.92]Photo.
[11:24.75]Oh, I see.
[11:25.19]There's a ghost in this photo.
[11:31.54]1985.
[11:31.56]Alright, so did I take these photos?
[11:34.52]I took this photo.
[11:35.30]Alright, what about over here?
[11:39.55]I would rather not open it.
[11:40.83]I spent too much time to lock him in there.
[11:43.35]I mean, lock who in there?
[11:46.99]But this guy I don't care about, by the way.
[11:49.09]The guy in here.
[11:50.49]Container.
[11:51.62]The lock is jammed a long time ago.
[11:52.80]Never mind.
[11:53.12]I used to keep useless junk in there anyways.
[11:54.84]Why do you have so much useless stuff?
[11:56.00]What's with all the donuts?
[11:58.22]I don't know how to do that.
[11:59.64]How to do what?
[12:02.64]Okay.
[12:05.78]Him.
[12:06.42]Him.
[12:06.70]Alright, well where's it gonna go?
[12:08.04]I need to find a can of gasoline to the east.
[12:11.24]Locked.
[12:11.50]I think I left the key in the wardrobe.
[12:13.08]Oh, come on.
[12:15.32]Where's the wardrobe?
[12:20.89]My tools.
[12:21.61]They haven't been sterilized for years.
[12:23.23]The local patients can't be helped anyways.
[12:26.57]Alright.
[12:28.29]So I can't use them.
[12:29.61]Where's the wardrobe?
[12:33.50]This is not a wardrobe right here?
[12:34.54]Isn't this a wardrobe?
[12:41.70]How do I leave my house?
[12:43.40]How do I leave the house?
[12:46.26]Locked.
[12:46.50]I think I left the key in the wardrobe.
[12:50.44]Oh, there's another room here.
[12:52.12]You can only select and interact with objects within your reach.
[12:54.44]The interaction range is indicated by the color-changing cursor.
[12:59.81]Color-changing cursor?
[13:03.63]Oh, okay.
[13:04.87]Alright, let's look at the bed.
[13:06.37]Just woke up.
[13:08.61]Radio Unitra.
[13:13.54]The radio has been silent for years.
[13:15.42]Although sometimes I think it can hear voices through the static.
[13:21.18]I guess, I don't know.
[13:27.86]Wardrobe, there we go.
[13:28.60]Alright, I know these notes by heart.
[13:30.40]I don't want to... What did it say?
[13:36.28]Quickly produced moonshine barely filtered.
[13:38.30]So what does this do?
[13:41.44]Board.
[13:43.52]Matchstick.
[13:45.58]Rag.
[13:47.50]Key.
[13:48.98]Where'd it go?
[13:49.62]What?
[13:50.20]My medical book.
[13:51.72]I thought that was a picture of me for a second.
[13:55.62]I don't know why I thought it for one second.
[13:57.28]Okay.
[13:59.60]So this is some kind of illness that's been spreading.
[14:03.66]Okay.
[14:04.10]Anything else in the book?
[14:07.32]Alright, hold on.
[14:07.90]Board.
[14:09.04]Matchstick.
[14:11.98]Can I, like, use the board as a weapon?
[14:13.40]Alright, I have the board selected.
[14:18.58]So I can just, like, cross somebody in the head with this, right?
[14:21.02]Alright, well, I got the key.
[14:27.12]Locked.
[14:27.36]I think I left the key in the wardrobe.
[14:28.66]I have the key on me.
[14:30.51]How do I get my inventory?
[14:33.24]The cursor has a plus icon next to it.
[14:34.96]You can hold left mouse button to open the selected object's action menu.
[14:42.85]Got it.
[14:44.45]Alright, I'm ready.
[14:45.03]Is this a dog?
[14:52.39]What do I do?
[14:54.29]Wait, hammer.
[14:55.60]Can I use the hammer?
[14:58.80]Destroyed well.
[15:00.80]Rope.
[15:02.63]This is a survival game.
[15:03.53]Do I have to survive in this game?
[15:06.87]My 125p.
[15:08.03]It used to be a luxury, but since all the access roads have been devoured by the woods, it became a useless pile of trash.
[15:19.28]The People's Tribune.
[15:20.18]Daily newspaper of the Polish People's Republic.
[15:24.20]Okay.
[15:25.60]To Edward Gyrick.
[15:29.61]Oh, this is not English.
[15:32.03]Something about the United States right here.
[15:36.57]Anybody read Polish?
[15:40.98]I don't know what that says.
[15:45.16]Deduced.
[15:47.64]My dog.
[15:48.16]I don't think he's going to make it.
[15:49.04]I should end his suffering.
[15:50.19]No!
[15:52.29]No, not the dog.
[15:53.87]Immediately you're going to throw the dog at me.
[15:58.58]I don't know what to do.
[15:59.24]How?
[16:01.00]Wooden doll.
[16:02.00]A large humanoid doll with a carved out face.
[16:05.98]Okay, that was like loud.
[16:07.00]Alright, I don't like this.
[16:17.12]Barricaded window.
[16:19.58]So what's the point?
[16:20.08]What's over here?
[16:20.52]Do I actually have to walk through the dark woods?
[16:25.32]Is that the whole point?
[16:31.23]I don't know what to do about the dog!
[16:33.83]I really don't know what to do.
[16:35.03]For a space to vault over obstacles like fences or windows.
[16:44.13]It's the ti- he said the title.
[16:50.20]Can I like... alcohol?
[16:52.02]No?
[16:52.30]Like, I can't... I don't know what to do.
[17:00.12]Oh, it's actually, you actually have to vault.
[17:05.08]Okay.
[17:07.28]I gotta put both headphones in for this, because otherwise people are gonna scream at me.
[17:09.86]Alright, go east.
[17:12.40]Do I have a compass?
[17:20.87]I got an axe.
[17:21.55]Alright, axe.
[17:23.81]A formidable weapon.
[17:28.97]Oh, sick.
[17:29.69]Okay.
[17:32.73]So you hold right... You hold right trigger, and you get a cursor, and you just overhead swing into things?
[17:42.62]Do I cut down trees?
[17:44.99]I don't think so.
[17:45.61]Alright, go east.
[17:46.31]This is south.
[17:47.49]Although I don't know which way I'm facing, so it could be anything.
[17:52.07]Dog, dog, dog, dog!
[18:01.43]I don't want to do this, though.
[18:13.04]I'm sorry.
[18:15.56]Be at peace.
[18:16.12]I missed.
[18:18.84]I'm sorry, be at peace.
[18:22.20]Oh my god, I can't even do that.
[18:23.96]I'm sorry, be at peace!
[18:30.40]I'm not doing a very good job.
[18:34.68]This is fucking embarrassing.
[18:37.50]My dog.
[18:37.90]I don't think he's gonna make it.
[18:38.58]I should end his suffering.
[18:47.15]I don't know how to do that.
[18:47.93]What do you mean you don't know how to do that?
[18:56.85]I left-click dog, my dog.
[18:59.57]Middle mouse.
[19:00.43]I don't know how to do that.
[19:01.83]Right-click.
[19:02.97]He won't swing.
[19:03.99]No, this is not an alright scenario.
[19:05.71]This is a horrible scenario.
[19:13.10]Freddie Dredd just gave 10,000 bits.
[19:16.06]Here's some bits for your boy.
[19:18.48]Thank you for streaming.
[19:20.66]Then left-click.
[19:35.56]I don't like this game.
[19:39.67]Alright, so I don't like this game.
[19:41.13]I'm gonna do the coloring book instead.
[19:44.37]Uh, but thank you freddydread for the 10,000 bits, really appreciate it.
[19:49.24]So it's not hold and let go, it's hold and then left click.
[19:52.54]And then clowndaddy just gave five community subs, thank you for the five community subs.
[19:56.50]Appreciate it.
[19:58.34]With a weapon selected in your ha- I just had to walk five feet.
[20:03.24]With a weapon in your hop bar, hold right mouse button to take aim, then press left while aiming to attack.
[20:06.80]Okay.
[20:07.24]Sure.
[20:07.80]Right.
[20:08.92]Tree.
[20:10.58]Knock down the tree.
[20:13.32]It's fucking loud.
[20:15.63]Too loud.
[20:16.11]I don't like how loud this is.
[20:17.09]Alright.
[20:17.69]These trees are growing too fast.
[20:20.57]Soon I won't be able to cut them down fast enough.
[20:23.79]Bear trap.
[20:27.15]Pick it up.
[20:27.51]Okay.
[20:27.77]Dead cow.
[20:29.41]Cow bone.
[20:31.34]Alright, I got a cow bone.
[20:36.44]Weapons have durability.
[20:37.26]Look at that.
[20:37.64]It's already almost done.
[20:38.66]What about up here?
[20:46.04]Left shift.
[20:46.46]What does that say?
[20:46.90]Left shift what?
[20:49.52]Left shift run.
[20:53.38]Location found.
[20:54.34]Path.
[20:54.66]What are you talking about?
[20:56.86]Location found.
[20:57.62]Alright, where's east?
[20:59.08]I'm going east, right?
[21:03.67]I can hear shit behind me.
[21:04.67]What does that mean?
[21:08.26]Is this the radio on Silent Hill?
[21:10.86]When you start to hear like the weird echo-y music, it means that there's something like a monster or something, right?
[21:14.30]Alright, I'm gonna get ready.
[21:16.98]To access the map, press M. This is like a stomach and intestinal track.
[21:26.89]This is where I am.
[21:28.35]Your position on the map is not marked.
[21:30.93]When you discover a new location, it will be added to your map.
[21:36.57]The location you are currently in is indicated in red.
[21:39.91]In order not to get lost, you need to learn how to determine your position relative to the discovered locations and landmarks.
[21:47.81]Alright, so I'm here.
[21:48.94]I gotta go down.
[21:52.38]Oh, this is gonna be... I'm so glad I have you guys here.
[21:57.34]I'm so happy you guys are here.
[21:58.44]You guys can help me.
[21:59.06]Unless they had an axe, of course.
[22:18.10]I drank, like, two cups of coffee today.
[22:20.54]So I'm already really jumpy.
[22:22.92]Just to make sure everybody aware of that.
[22:24.42]I'm so glad I have a limiter on my mic now.
[22:27.35]Because, like, I'm gonna scream at some point, probably.
[22:29.71]And it's gonna be so loud, but I have a limiter.
[22:32.43]What's this?
[22:33.37]Burned campfire.
[22:35.81]To immediately transfer items between inventories, hold left control or left shift when clicking.
[22:40.20]Okay.
[22:42.44]Can I have more than one rag?
[22:43.48]Okay.
[22:47.51]How many boards can I have?
[22:48.63]Seven.
[22:49.59]How many matches can I have?
[22:50.63]Twenty-one.
[22:51.29]How many brags can I have in one stack?
[22:52.93]Five.
[22:54.75]What do I do with these, though?
[22:57.89]Should I go up?
[22:58.75]Wait, where am I?
[22:59.32]Okay, I'm here.
[23:01.10]There's an up... Oh, wait.
[23:02.34]Check down here.
[23:13.04]What's that?
[23:15.75]Oh, there's light over there.
[23:19.42]Happy Halloween, by the way, guys.
[23:23.36]Do a tuber voice.
[23:25.24]Why would I do a tuber voice right now?
[23:27.40]These parts of the woods are dark.
[23:28.56]I should craft a torch.
[23:32.18]Tab is your... This wasn't here before.
[23:35.09]Uh, crafting.
[23:37.27]Torch.
[23:39.03]You have seven boards.
[23:40.29]You need one, one, one.
[23:41.63]It's okay.
[23:42.19]Craft a torch.
[23:45.69]How many should I make?
[23:46.33]Should I make more than one?
[23:51.39]What's a super torch?
[23:53.82]Oh, this is a gasoline torch.
[23:55.16]Okay.
[23:57.38]Alright, so I have... Okay.
[23:59.94]So, did... Okay, I can... Alright, you can swing this.
[24:06.72]Oh, for the love of God.
[24:07.66]I have to switch weapons?
[24:10.26]Can I kill people with the torch?
[24:15.71]I hope so.
[24:20.85]Where am I?
[24:22.07]I don't know.
[24:22.59]Up.
[24:22.81]I have to go up.
[24:27.49]Abandoned house.
[24:30.90]Where's the house?
[24:31.76]Where's the... Oh, it's right here.
[24:32.94]There's a wall here.
[24:33.60]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[24:35.24]I gotta be ready to burn him, motherfucker.
[24:37.46]No, don't barricade this door.
[24:38.60]Go in.
[24:41.84]Should I be going... Should I go in here?
[24:46.24]Chair.
[24:47.52]Wardrobe.
[24:50.30]Oh shit, there's rags in here.
[24:51.56]Nice.
[24:53.30]Bread.
[24:55.24]I'm out of space.
[24:56.92]Rag.
[24:59.44]I'm going to make some more torches.
[25:02.04]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[25:06.18]Right?
[25:06.48]Yeah.
[25:09.57]How long does this last?
[25:15.07]Matchstick.
[25:15.65]Torch.
[25:16.77]Torch.
[25:17.13]Can I stack them?
[25:19.81]I can't stack the torches.
[25:20.75]What about bone?
[25:22.80]They last for 20 minutes.
[25:23.84]Alright, what about the pills?
[25:24.92]What about the board?
[25:26.78]Turn the lights on.
[25:27.72]This post-apocalyptic world, there's no lights?
[25:31.74]I kind of want to take this stuff, though.
[25:36.00]Brag.
[25:38.21]Bread.
[25:38.51]I need to take this bread.
[25:39.53]Why am I saying that so fucking strangely?
[25:41.61]Bread.
[25:42.45]Bread.
[25:43.11]Bread.
[25:44.71]Rope.
[25:45.07]Torch.
[25:46.17]Uh... Just eat the bread.
[25:47.73]I'm dying right now.
[25:48.69]Why do I have half health?
[25:50.01]How do I eat it?
[25:55.26]Your lungs are more efficient because you ate bread.
[26:01.84]What?
[26:02.54]Did I inhale it?
[26:07.40]How do you save the game?
[26:08.73]Is there a save?
[26:09.35]Okay, there's somebody like out here.
[26:11.43]Get the axe.
[26:21.94]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[26:22.92]Alright, I'm out.
[26:25.44]I ate the bread.
[26:26.50]That means I'm not hungry anymore.
[26:29.54]Is there a save?
[26:30.78]There's no save.
[26:34.01]Alright, where the fuck am I?
[26:34.83]Alright, there's the house.
[26:35.47]I gotta go right.
[26:36.09]Can I vault?
[26:39.87]How can I climb this?
[26:40.79]I don't think I can climb that.
[26:42.93]Can I go through here?
[26:53.55]You can only save at a cooking station.
[26:56.57]Alright, up maybe, over here.
[27:00.07]Because I came from this way, though.
[27:01.63]I'm already lost in the woods.
[27:02.73]I have no idea where I'm going.
[27:03.57]Alright, this is a... This thing's gonna get up.
[27:18.64]In a few days, it will be completely absorbed.
[27:20.50]Absorbed into what?
[27:22.14]Clothes.
[27:23.30]Fucking rags.
[27:24.24]I don't... I don't know what to do with rags.
[27:30.09]Clothes.
[27:30.73]Searched.
[27:31.55]Yep.
[27:32.97]More rags.
[27:36.11]There's a deer over here.
[27:37.25]Or an elk.
[27:38.19]Or a moose.
[27:38.63]I don't know.
[27:39.01]Whatever this is supposed to be.
[27:51.14]Ah, I hate it.
[27:53.46]Clothes.
[27:53.96]Rags.
[27:54.31]I don't need rags.
[27:56.85]My medical bag?
[27:57.83]It's useless.
[28:01.17]But it's worth a hundred bucks.
[28:02.49]I don't understand.
[28:06.73]Why is it worth so much money?
[28:11.12]Who do you sell stuff to in this game?
[28:18.02]I made it through this.
[28:24.31]I haven't been in here, though.
[28:27.68]Doorway.
[28:28.20]Repair.
[28:30.40]Search these clothes.
[28:31.16]More rags.
[28:31.88]I don't... I wish there would be more than five stacks.
[28:36.36]Bottle?
[28:36.84]An empty glass bottle?
[28:37.94]I don't think I need this stuff.
[28:40.76]More rags.
[28:41.57]What am I going to do with these rags?
[28:50.99]They're coming.
[28:51.93]Who's coming?
[28:52.45]No one's coming.
[28:53.79]Don't say that.
[28:54.49]Don't say they're coming.
[28:56.03]Alright, so I gotta go up.
[29:02.92]Let's go.
[29:03.32]Alright, slow down.
[29:11.42]I can't run that.
[29:12.02]Alright, guy.
[29:14.85]Guy over here.
[29:17.43]Do I have to put this guy at peace too?
[29:23.50]I'm walking over with an axe, but still.
[29:27.77]I think this one is still breathing.
[29:30.95]Be at peace.
[29:32.67]Can I talk?
[29:35.61]Big metal key.
[29:37.33]If there is an exit out of these woods, this key will surely open it.
[29:40.67]Number 21.
[29:46.67]He's unconscious.
[29:47.33]I've never seen him around here before.
[29:48.63]It's me.
[29:48.97]It's gonna be me.
[29:54.01]He's only carrying a key and some journal.
[30:00.33]Since he managed to sneak in here, he must know how to get out.
[30:07.23]Of course he won't help me voluntarily.
[30:11.57]Syringe.
[30:13.39]But that... is of no importance.
[30:31.06]I need to get out of this accursed forest.
[30:35.28]You hear me, rat?
[30:36.08]Where's the rat?
[30:39.72]Show me how and I will let you go.
[30:41.60]I sometimes hear her voice.
[30:51.64]She's calling me.
[30:55.70]Calling me to return home.
[31:03.88]Where is the exit?
[31:04.88]Am I interrogating this person?
[31:07.88]Where's the exit?
[31:11.70]Show me where.
[31:12.57]I don't even know if... For all I know, this could be just some person that just went wandering in the woods.
[31:23.49]Hey!
[31:26.09]I'll kill you like a dog if I have to.
[31:30.95]So I'm the bad guy.
[31:37.84]What if we don't kill the dog?
[31:42.97]I knew I was the bad guy and now I'm this guy.
[31:46.65]Yep.
[31:47.65]And now I gotta kill me who was me in the tutorial.
[31:50.53]You got it.
[31:50.97]That fucker stole my key.
[31:55.37]An entry to a small cell.
[31:56.23]Maybe the pantry.
[31:56.87]Let's get in.
[31:57.89]Use lockpick.
[31:58.59]I have lockpick.
[31:59.61]Search.
[32:00.57]I couldn't open it with a lockpick.
[32:02.51]I could open it with a lockpick.
[32:03.89]Okay.
[32:04.05]Crafting.
[32:04.47]I can make a lockpick.
[32:05.27]How do I make a lockpick?
[32:07.88]One lockpick is two lockpicks.
[32:11.15]What?
[32:11.95]Why would two lockpicks make one lockpick?
[32:15.83]Needs two... Oh, it's like wire.
[32:17.67]That's not what it... Okay.
[32:20.91]Alright.
[32:21.49]Hey, uh... My stomach hurts!
[32:24.18]I'm gonna puke in here, man!
[32:26.48]That's the fucking best way to do it.
[32:27.76]Alright, let's see.
[32:28.32]What else we got?
[32:30.04]This barricade's too strong.
[32:30.92]Alright.
[32:33.82]Easy.
[32:39.62]Let's make that lockpick and get out of here.
[32:44.36]Okay, lockpick.
[32:46.49]We can also make gauze.
[32:48.51]Heals wounds.
[32:49.33]Alright, let's use that.
[32:50.25]Nice tutorial.
[32:50.95]Teach me how to use gauze.
[32:53.33]Okay, so use gauze.
[32:54.77]Okay, use.
[32:58.43]Alright, lockpick.
[32:59.61]Let's do it.
[33:03.11]Unlocked.
[33:04.05]What's in the container?
[33:06.81]A shovel.
[33:07.37]It's heavy, but it has good reach.
[33:08.73]And a flashlight.
[33:19.48]Alright, so I gotta bash this guy's head in with the shovel.
[33:23.90]It's too strong to dismantle.
[33:25.36]So just smash it down.
[33:27.42]Alright, does he hear that?
[33:31.44]The item is no longer usable.
[33:39.13]Okay, I'm out.
[33:43.25]Whoa!
[33:43.87]Wait, he was right in front of me!
[33:44.91]He was literally right there!
[33:46.44]Okay.
[33:48.72]It took me so long to register that he was standing there.
[33:56.98]Holy shit, my, like, pee brain.
[34:03.07]That's supposed to scare you immediately, and it took me- Syringe.
[34:11.65]Oh, fuck.
[34:12.47]Can I hit him with the flashlight?
[34:16.91]I better not leave the house at night.
[34:18.16]It's safer here.
[34:20.30]Is this just a series of taking the house from the person who squatted in the house before you?
[34:26.84]Where the fuck is this guy?
[34:32.49]Lamp.
[34:33.23]Turn the lamp on.
[34:36.59]Turn the la- Turn it on.
[34:38.03]How many batteries are in this flashlight?
[34:41.31]Oh, there's a code.
[34:47.39]Please let me out.
[34:48.15]What?
[34:49.11]There's other people in here.
[34:49.89]Alright, hold on.
[34:56.98]Is it... What is that?
[34:57.52]Is it a bomb?
[35:00.28]I think it's a bomb.
[35:00.98]Alright, don't touch this.
[35:02.76]It's a bomb.
[35:03.22]That's a bomb.
[35:03.78]It's a gonna... That's a bomb.
[35:05.42]Right?
[35:05.88]Stuff doesn't blink red unless it's a bomb.
[35:09.94]Dismantle the bomb.
[35:10.92]Turn... Alright, it's not a bomb.
[35:14.26]It's a radio.
[35:17.09]No, it's a bomb.
[35:18.33]Right?
[35:18.77]Why is it connected over here?
[35:32.73]How do I get the fucking thing open?
[35:34.95]What about over here?
[35:35.99]This is connected to this.
[35:38.25]Lamp on.
[35:41.29]Search the- what's going on?
[35:43.81]Can I punch?
[35:45.28]This is the- the radio needs to be dialed to like a certain frequency, right?
[35:50.52]And then the frequency will open the door.
[36:17.55]That was fucking easy.
[36:18.91]Alright, watch out.
[36:25.09]Somebody in here?
[36:25.95]Somebody in there.
[36:26.49]There's like a torture device in here.
[36:28.75]Alright, generator.
[36:30.59]Don't turn it on yet.
[36:31.33]That's going to activate everything.
[36:33.03]Meal table.
[36:34.07]A meal table with a leather belt strapped on.
[36:38.15]Metal table.
[36:41.16]A meal- a meal table.
[36:43.46]What's in here?
[36:47.57]Why'd everything turn off?
[36:51.01]Is there somebody in here?
[36:51.99]He's gonna be in this box!
[36:59.70]Okay, no, there's nobody in the box.
[37:01.50]It's just gasoline, table leg.
[37:05.32]Use it as a weapon.
[37:06.01]You got it.
[37:06.39]Uh, I'm gonna keep the shovel, though, just in case I need it.
[37:12.59]Fuck out of here.
[37:17.09]I need the code.
[37:17.75]How do I get the code to let the other person out?
[37:19.15]Generator on.
[37:19.77]Let's go.
[37:20.83]To refill the generator, click the gasoline tank, cover your mouse over the generator, hold right mouse button, follow button, then press the button to tap gasoline.
[37:25.53]Alright.
[37:33.98]I'm gonna smash this guy's head in.
[37:41.54]How much do I have to- I have to refill it THAT much?
[37:50.59]Incoming joke alert!
[37:51.73]Incoming joke alert!
[37:53.75]Aw man, I've been playing WoW for like fucking 6 hours!
[37:56.75]When am I gonna get to 60?! !
[38:01.54]Everybody fucking laugh immediately at that hilarious fucking WoW reference.
[38:18.77]Yes!
[38:18.91]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[38:22.96]Actually, pay attention.
[38:24.86]Not funny, didn't laugh.
[38:25.82]Yes, you fucking did.
[38:26.72]I saw it.
[38:32.15]I told you it was a bomb.
[38:44.58]The corpse has two dials instead of eyes.
[38:46.66]His mouth is wide open and I can hear a distorted voice.
[38:49.30]Barely distinguishable from the radio static.
[38:51.06]Turn on the generator!
[38:52.08]Turn on the generator!
[38:53.08]Wait, it's not on?
[39:03.01]Alright, he's going to get up.
[39:04.45]Right?
[39:08.95]I'm ready.
[39:09.53]I'm ready.
[39:09.99]Right when he comes up.
[39:10.71]This is going right in his head.
[39:13.24]The corpse has two dials.
[39:14.50]His mouth's open.
[39:15.14]I can hear it.
[39:16.10]It's barely just coming from the radio static. 4892.
[39:32.22]4892.
[39:32.28]Okay.
[39:32.54]4892.
[39:34.14]Got it.
[39:34.94]Who the fuck's in here?
[39:50.31]The door seems stuck.
[39:50.97]I need to apply some force to it.
[40:06.94]Help me.
[40:11.01]Come... You don't say come closer if you need help.
[40:14.61]That's like what the witches and the fucking bad guys from Disney movies tell you.
[40:23.92]Hey!
[40:24.44]I knew it!
[40:25.24]You fucking Disney witch!
[40:42.46]I didn't even know there was a corner there, really.
[40:44.18]I just saw it.
[40:47.21]Plastic chick, or... It's a bomb.
[40:51.25]This is a bomb.
[41:00.83]Oh.
[41:02.09]Who's laughing?
[41:02.67]Why?
[41:05.79]And how do you want to get out now?
[41:09.91]You think you can man age all by yourself?
[41:15.23]Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[41:18.53]Hear it.
[41:26.94]Next motherfucker that comes near me is getting plopped in the fucking head.
[41:31.64]Who's in the house?
[41:33.40]Somebody coming in the house right now.
[41:34.86]Alright, I gotta get out of the house, I think.
[41:36.36]There's an alien!
[41:43.97]Did I lose?
[41:47.97]Or is that scripted?
[41:51.93]I think that's scripted.
[41:53.35]That was fucking terrifying.
[42:00.68]I hate fucking two headphones.
[42:07.80]Now this is too loud.
[42:08.76]I have to drop this.
[42:09.58]It's too much.
[42:12.48]Right.
[42:13.04]Outstretching the hand.
[42:14.18]Come back.
[42:19.00]Leave the volume.
[42:19.72]No, it's too loud for me.
[42:21.66]It's too loud for you guys.
[42:22.56]Chapter 1.
[42:25.03]Don't do it or I'll leave.
[42:26.91]Don't turn the volume down a little bit so you'll leave?
[42:28.81]Or is this me again?
[42:35.33]Alright.
[42:37.58]Do I have no stuff?
[42:40.10]Bandages with alcohol.
[42:41.02]Good for heavy wounds.
[42:45.81]A pleasant worth is emanating from the oven.
[42:48.03]I can sense a strange yet familiar scent.
[42:50.70]It's the smell of the protective substance, which gives me relative safety after dark.
[42:56.87]The vapors rising from the huge cauldron are distributed all over the house via long pipes.
[43:01.82]As long as I remain inside my hideout, I have a chance of surviving the night.
[43:05.58]Examine the oven.
[43:06.62]Look at the weird bottle.
[43:07.82]Let's examine that oven.
[43:09.75]When I arrived here a couple days ago, the oven was basically prepared.
[43:12.23]I just needed to light it up to ensure my safety at night.
[43:16.03]This cottage must have been one of our hideouts.
[43:18.73]One of our hideouts.
[43:21.68]The inhabitants of these woods don't need to inhale this revolting gas.
[43:27.79]That's a weird bottle.
[43:29.53]The label on the bottle says, staying out of the reach of the protective substance after nightfall results in immediate death in 99 out of 100 cases.
[43:39.12]It's advised to evenly spread the gas inside the sleeping area.
[43:45.18]Okay, so you have to be in the gas.
[43:49.71]Huh.
[43:49.93]So we need to set up a stove that has gas coming out of it.
[44:07.07]A small empty cast iron pot.
[44:08.47]I haven't used it yet.
[44:09.43]I haven't felt any hunger or thirst since the accident a few days ago.
[44:12.27]I can't stop thinking about one thing.
[44:14.79]These mushrooms.
[44:16.22]These red pulsating mushrooms.
[44:17.80]They look so tasty.
[44:19.76]Maybe this pot will prove useful after all.
[44:25.06]Cook.
[44:29.41]Oven efficiency 1.
[44:30.25]You just make a giant mushroom syringe?
[44:36.11]Holy shit.
[44:36.73]Okay, well, I don't have anything.
[44:38.17]Essence.
[44:39.25]Dose 1.
[44:44.97]That... Oh, that's what you meant when you said cooking saves the game.
[44:49.25]I see.
[44:49.69]Alright, let's go.
[44:51.25]Turn the lamp on.
[44:51.97]I can't even turn anything.
[44:52.85]Wardrobe.
[44:53.31]Nothing in there.
[44:53.89]Except there's a nail.
[44:54.89]Use that as a weapon.
[44:57.31]I don't think I can.
[44:58.09]Rag.
[44:59.39]And photo of road.
[45:01.29]The road home.
[45:05.51]Okay.
[45:11.20]Wooden door.
[45:12.02]I think this is fairly safe in here.
[45:13.68]I don't know that I've been wrong.
[45:16.06]It's okay.
[45:17.57]Fucking creaky dog shit.
[45:19.07]Yesterday I barricaded one of the windows.
[45:20.55]If I want to stay here for some time, I should do the same with the other windows.
[45:26.38]Okay.
[45:26.50]Okay.
[45:33.15]done workbench repair I know man this is gonna get this is gonna get nasty for me hot bar upgrade so I get more slots I need one blanket and one wire board with nails antidote cures poison gas bottle
[45:57.26]Okay, upgrade workshop.
[45:58.96]I need six boards.
[45:59.98]I need, okay.
[46:00.62]Alright, okay, okay, okay.
[46:02.44]Let's just, hold on.
[46:04.80]I can't board these up.
[46:06.62]Large mushrooms.
[46:07.44]Harvest them.
[46:12.74]Got it.
[46:13.74]Odd looking mushroom.
[46:17.03]Cookable.
[46:18.47]Okay.
[46:18.73]Okay.
[46:23.65]Alright, y'all are going to think I'm insane for doing this, but I'm going to bind sprint to one of my mouse buttons.
[46:30.69]I mean, I know y'all are going to think I'm insane for doing that, but I have to.
[46:33.61]Okay, sprint.
[46:38.32]Run, left shift, no.
[46:39.34]No.
[46:45.00]It's going to be mouse button 5.
[46:52.56]That's a thousand times better.
[46:54.26]So now, if I want to go left and sprint, I don't have to hit A and then shift with my pinky.
[47:01.24]Much better.
[47:01.70]Got it.
[47:02.04]Alright.
[47:04.64]Is this a streamer that sprints with his mouse?
[47:06.53]Yes.
[47:07.79]Alright, so we got Mushroom.
[47:09.93]Oh, wait.
[47:10.57]What did I just do?
[47:14.25]Is this like to level up your health or something?
[47:22.01]Yeah.
[47:23.06]It's, uh, you collect mushrooms and you put it in there and you level it up.
[47:25.46]Yeah, right here.
[47:26.04]Check this out.
[47:28.58]Harvest these.
[47:31.66]And then I can, I fill it up with syringe and then syringe myself in the neck and I'll get another bar of HP.
[47:36.63]Got it.
[47:38.37]So they've wrought over time, though, which is trying to figure out what that means, how long that takes.
[47:46.23]Look for a couple more of these things.
[47:51.06]What's that?
[47:52.06]You are in the hideout.
[47:53.44]Under the influence of the protective substance.
[47:55.14]It will help you survive.
[47:56.20]Okay.
[48:00.06]Build a well.
[48:00.74]I don't want to build a fucking well.
[48:06.40]Saw.
[48:07.86]Use a saw.
[48:09.28]Convert wood logs to planks.
[48:11.16]Okay, I can make planks.
[48:18.42]Do I have to like fall out for this house?
[48:21.64]Is that what's going on here?
[48:23.94]I want another mushroom.
[48:30.22]Oh boy, I got a map too.
[48:31.24]Alright, underground entrance.
[48:32.70]That's the X. That's where I gotta go.
[48:35.52]Right?
[48:35.92]What's the mission?
[48:36.72]What's the goal of the whole game?
[48:37.94]I don't know.
[48:38.24]Let me put that mushroom back in here.
[48:42.17]Alright, cook.
[48:53.58]Alright, they're worth ten each.
[48:57.36]Escape the forest.
[48:59.50]Alright.
[49:00.14]Sounds easy enough.
[49:03.25]I need to barricade this, though.
[49:04.37]Look at how fucked up this is.
[49:05.25]Wait, what's in here?
[49:11.19]This generator is half empty.
[49:12.35]It contains enough gasoline for one more night.
[49:14.83]I should find a full can in the house above the underground entrance.
[49:20.58]Oh, shit.
[49:21.08]You have some stuff on you.
[49:24.67]Got a torch on you.
[49:25.53]Thanks, man.
[49:28.91]Okay, that's an overhead swing.
[49:33.14]Alright, now... I need to get the gas that's under the underground entrance.
[49:42.12]Say that again, one more time.
[49:45.08]I have enough for one more night.
[49:48.76]That's not good.
[49:50.20]Um, okay.
[49:53.70]I can't sprint around everywhere.
[49:56.54]Don't waste the torch.
[49:57.80]Oh, I'm sorry.
[50:00.84]So how do I get over there?
[50:01.70]There's an underground entrance.
[50:02.98]There's a full can of gas over here.
[50:08.08]Where?
[50:17.15]Full can of gas?
[50:23.55]It's a dog.
[50:25.35]Is it a poisoned dog?
[50:27.92]Or is it a regular?
[50:28.68]It sounds like a regular dog.
[50:48.05]Okay, dog.
[50:49.15]Is it a regular dog or is it an infected dog?
[50:53.25]Is there a difference in this game?
[50:56.07]Is that an affected dog?
[50:58.89]Is this dog affected?
[51:02.89]You don't sound infected.
[51:03.93]Get out of here!
[51:33.25]Goddammit, where's the underground entrance?
[51:37.72]I need to find the full can of gasoline or I'm not gonna be able to survive another night!
[51:45.22]Oh, that's where I am.
[51:46.14]I have to go up and to the left.
[51:49.82]Loot the dog.
[51:50.30]The dog is still alive.
[51:51.56]I can't loot the dog.
[51:59.50]Is that a beetle?! !
[52:01.62]There are more than one dog now.
[52:17.01]I need to get the gasoline or I can't do this.
[52:19.75]Gasoline!
[52:20.31]Alright, I'm going this way.
[52:25.84]There's always a bigger dog.
[52:29.90]Just don't go near the dogs.
[52:32.64]I don't know where the fuck they are.
[52:34.06]They're just hanging out.
[52:35.22]They're just in random spots.
[52:37.24]Okay, I need to go this way.
[52:38.64]Underground entrance.
[52:39.32]Get me up there.
[52:39.82]I'm just going to run away from the dogs if I see them.
[52:44.06]Is it night time?
[52:45.27]The sun's out.
[52:48.85]Is the sun out right?
[52:49.71]Alright, there's a dog.
[52:56.45]Why did they just... Okay, I'm here.
[52:58.29]Underground entrance.
[53:00.29]Where is it?
[53:05.07]Underground entrance.
[53:06.01]I'm here.
[53:08.57]Where's the underground entrance?
[53:10.80]Found it.
[53:11.50]Right there.
[53:12.04]Don't step on the bear trap.
[53:17.48]And give it to me.
[53:19.06]Okay.
[53:22.67]Is this it?
[53:33.82]Am I in a zone I'm not supposed to be in?
[53:40.92]Bear trap.
[53:41.70]If I climb through this window, I'll step in it.
[53:46.88]And I don't want to step in that.
[53:48.48]Why can I not punch?
[53:51.63]This is the house.
[53:52.75]I'll find the entrance to the underground here.
[53:54.31]I'm not bleeding, so I'll be okay for a little while.
[54:00.27]I gotta get more mushrooms.
[54:08.51]Watch it for this shit.
[54:09.53]I'm gonna step in this.
[54:11.97]Is the cyclops being currently subs- E. E. I don't have anything.
[54:22.33]Oh, I can make another bandage.
[54:23.97]Might as well.
[54:28.74]Bed.
[54:30.40]Backpack.
[54:32.22]Ooh, nice.
[54:32.92]Okay.
[54:33.36]Bread.
[54:33.78]Pills.
[54:34.10]What do the pills do?
[54:36.02]Medium caliber.
[54:36.92]But there's guns in this game?
[54:39.01]And a battery?
[54:39.61]Wait, there's guns.
[54:45.69]Ooh, shit.
[54:46.27]Alright, lockpick.
[54:47.89]Nail.
[54:48.63]Couple of rags.
[54:53.35]There it is.
[54:54.07]Full gasoline.
[54:56.07]Pack of... I thought that was... Is this a... Pack of cigarettes.
[55:00.84]Looks like an apple.
[55:10.06]Oh, that's why it looks like that.
[55:11.26]Okay.
[55:14.27]I guess it's just an interesting thing to find.
[55:16.23]Alright, I got the... Do I have a weapon?
[55:19.93]I have a weapon, right?
[55:20.75]Do I have a weapon?
[55:23.31]I don't have any weapon.
[55:25.21]Make a torch.
[55:27.29]And an advantage.
[55:30.07]Fuck.
[55:31.09]Okay, move this.
[55:35.39]Am I stuck here?
[55:39.81]No, not anymore.
[55:40.33]This is... Oh, it's these!
[55:51.24]It's mushrooms.
[55:51.68]Nice.
[55:51.96]Okay, good.
[55:57.78]You used... Wait, what are you talking about?
[55:59.46]What?
[56:07.35]Did I use the gasoline?
[56:10.35]Why did I use the gasoline?
[56:15.84]I dumped it on the torch?
[56:18.48]Why would I do that?
[56:22.28]Whoa!
[56:23.10]I thought it was a person.
[56:23.98]I thought there was a specific gasoline torch.
[56:34.62]It's a red one.
[56:35.26]I don't have a red one in my inventory.
[56:37.26]See?
[56:37.52]Like gasoline torch.
[56:38.50]Look!
[56:39.54]Oh, I made that one.
[56:43.18]Right.
[56:44.18]Well, fuck.
[56:46.00]Is that gonna be the mistake that ends this whole thing and I have to restart the whole game?
[56:48.73]Tell me now.
[57:00.23]Okay, I'm gonna examine it.
[57:01.57]The entrance to the underground tunnels.
[57:04.56]I don't have any stuff.
[57:05.70]How am I going to do anything down here?
[57:07.12]At least the game saved.
[57:09.96]I have a mushroom.
[57:13.34]I don't want to... I can't... I don't... What am I looking for down here?
[57:19.00]I don't even know what I'm trying to do down here.
[57:23.76]What's the point of down here?
[57:29.47]I need a torch.
[57:31.57]Um... I have a... I have...
[57:34.25]Wait a minute, you're telling me that the torch with the gasoline on it?
[57:38.27]Oh, it's alcohol, technically.
[57:51.60]Rubble.
[57:52.76]The tunnel walls were crushed by enormous roots.
[57:55.22]Dig.
[57:55.48]I don't have a shovel.
[57:58.84]Shit.
[58:03.87]Nothing over here.
[58:04.31]Let's keep going.
[58:07.64]Go home.
[58:08.32]Go home.
[58:08.74]Go home.
[58:09.14]Go home.
[58:10.14]Should I go home?
[58:10.68]Keep going.
[58:11.74]Go.
[58:11.84]Go home.
[58:12.62]I'm going home.
[58:34.15]I'm going- I'm outta here.
[58:35.07]I'm going home.
[58:45.89]Okay.
[58:46.65]I have mushrooms to deposit into my mushroom syringe bank.
[58:49.23]Okay, now I gotta go this way.
[58:55.19]There's a dog.
[58:58.76]Where the fuck are these dogs?
[59:06.49]Out here into the right.
[59:08.31]Wait, what's up here?
[59:12.61]I'm so glad I have this stereo audio.
[59:16.74]So that I can hear where they're coming from.
[59:17.86]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[59:21.76]I gotta deposit that mushroom.
[59:25.02]And then I'm gonna make a... I need to make a weapon or something.
[59:27.12]I have to barricade boards and windows and... Alright, this way.
[59:36.25]What day is it?
[59:37.49]What time is it?
[59:39.91]Do I even have that knowledge right now?
[59:49.43]Oh, you motherfucker.
[59:50.32]Where are you?
[59:56.80]Is there any way I can see what time it is?
[60:01.52]Alright, so.
[60:04.16]Generator.
[60:05.52]Gasoline.
[60:09.90]Fill it up.
[60:11.92]Okay, here we go.
[60:13.73]Right?
[60:14.57]This is what I'm supposed to be doing.
[60:16.87]Right?
[60:17.13]I'm going for it.
[60:26.68]And I'm going to assume that the bar is a day.
[60:31.19]One of those bars is one day worth of fuel.
[60:36.23]Right?
[60:41.29]Okay.
[60:42.84]So I have two days, two and a half days worth of fuel.
[60:46.90]Now, climb over here.
[60:48.40]There's probably like a creeper in the house now because I didn't barricade any windows.
[60:58.92]The bear trap under the window is still open.
[61:00.48]Looks like this night was exceptionally uneventful.
[61:02.74]I didn't put that there, did I?
[61:03.74]Oh, fuck, there's stuff in here.
[61:06.62]Okay, rope.
[61:10.46]Two pieces of alcohol, two pieces of bottle, and a mushroom book.
[61:15.14]The title reads, The Use of Mushrooms in the Household.
[61:20.73]That's what it was.
[61:21.77]People are doing shrooms and giving themselves this, like, post-apocalyptic disease.
[61:29.56]Alright, we're almost there.
[61:30.62]Two more.
[61:34.56]Game is saved.
[61:35.48]Now I need to craft some stuff.
[61:39.64]Bandages with alcohol.
[61:43.04]Battery.
[61:43.36]Do I have a stash or anything?
[61:44.56]Can I stash?
[61:47.76]I can stash this stuff in here.
[61:51.45]Right?
[61:57.09]I can just put it in here.
[61:59.92]Alright, well, I don't need half of this stuff.
[62:01.22]I can put the pills in here.
[62:03.90]Scrap metal... Is there a way I can just control and do it?
[62:08.12]Yeah, okay.
[62:09.14]I'm gonna keep the lockpick.
[62:12.08]Keep the alcohol... I'll keep one alcohol, one rag.
[62:15.12]Keep the bread.
[62:15.66]I don't need the rope.
[62:17.42]I don't... Do I need these things?
[62:19.12]I don't know if I need these things or not.
[62:20.28]I have no idea.
[62:22.12]Nails?
[62:22.62]What do they do?
[62:23.56]I don't know.
[62:25.22]Check your journal.
[62:28.90]Items.
[62:33.31]Keys.
[62:33.95]Journal.
[62:34.61]Me.
[62:35.33]Skills.
[62:35.73]You have skills?
[62:39.25]Okay, so I need... I don't have any planks, though.
[62:43.99]Barricade.
[62:45.55]Barricade?
[62:46.37]I need three planks.
[62:47.43]I don't have any.
[62:55.70]Planks?
[62:56.06]Where the fuck do I get planks?
[62:58.82]Alright, I think I'm... I need a weapon!
[63:01.80]There's a sandwich outside.
[63:02.92]There's not a sandwich outside, I guarantee it.
[63:04.66]I don't know what to do with this stuff.
[63:17.61]Block all the doors with furniture.
[63:19.67]That's what I was thinking.
[63:28.56]Wait.
[63:28.78]Otherwise people can get in here.
[63:36.28]See what I mean?
[63:39.36]Like, people can get in that.
[63:40.32]I need planks.
[63:44.74]I'm gonna go on a plank mission.
[63:47.82]Can I move the bed?
[63:49.57]I cannot drag the bed.
[63:55.14]Alright, I got- let me consolidate.
[63:57.00]So I- empty bottle.
[63:58.74]I'm getting rid of this.
[63:59.94]Back to my stash.
[64:03.97]Turn- turn on the generator.
[64:05.21]Turn the generator on.
[64:05.99]Why?
[64:06.15]What are you talking about?
[64:10.61]I'll fucking have to- no, leave that.
[64:13.77]Generator, generator, generator, generator.
[64:15.90]I'm going!
[64:17.82]What?!
[64:19.50]Everybody just relax!
[64:24.12]Look.
[64:26.08]Hey, there we go.
[64:29.80]How I... I mean, it's kind of annoying.
[64:36.22]Should I save energy?
[64:38.81]Does it burn?
[64:39.33]I don't want to just leave my lights on and leave the house.
[64:41.53]Doesn't that sound bad?
[64:50.41]Keep them on.
[64:53.98]Alright.
[64:55.28]Don't leave during the night.
[64:56.98]What the fuck?
[64:58.50]Don't leave during the night.
[64:59.82]What the fuck?
[65:01.99]So... What do I... Just hang out until... How do I... Can I sleep at night?
[65:08.25]How do you sleep?
[65:16.56]So I just have to hang out here.
[65:20.10]Stay safe until daytime comes.
[65:22.93]Where's my watch?
[65:23.73]I don't even know what time it is.
[65:30.19]You wait, fucker.
[65:31.38]Oh my goodness.
[65:35.50]Whoa!
[65:53.49]This is because I'm looking over here.
[65:59.31]I'm looking over at you guys.
[66:01.70]And everyone's like, just hang out in the house.
[66:04.72]Hang out in the house.
[66:05.44]Don't step on the fucking bear trap.
[66:08.44]You knew it was going to happen like once, right?
[66:10.16]Like it was going to happen one time.
[66:11.30]Might as well happen once.
[66:12.54]I thought somebody threw an axe through the window.
[66:18.81]I really thought somebody threw an object at me.
[66:20.61]Alright.
[66:21.47]Stop.
[66:21.75]Am I bleeding?
[66:25.33]How do you tell if you're bleeding?
[66:36.31]Go near the light, please.
[66:38.04]No, I need to... I just stepped in a fucking bear trap.
[66:42.80]There's no more bears.
[66:44.08]I'm not setting traps.
[66:45.04]I'm not setting bear traps.
[66:46.02]Go to the light.
[66:46.58]Alright, alright, alright.
[66:47.40]I'm next to the light.
[66:47.98]I'm fine.
[66:49.26]And now I'm gonna heal.
[66:53.19]There.
[66:58.56]There's nobody in the house, right?
[67:04.76]There's nobody in here.
[67:15.54]Did that say possible mushroom?
[67:17.14]Poisonous mushrooms.
[67:21.87]Why is it coming out of the ground?
[67:26.89]What?
[67:28.33]That was possible mushrooms.
[67:29.49]That was right.
[67:30.07]Okay.
[67:30.41]Mushrooms.
[67:32.85]What's that sound?
[67:33.63]What's that sound?
[67:34.67]What's that?
[67:35.01]Stand next to the light.
[67:35.75]Next to the light.
[67:37.87]Just put a ton of light over here.
[67:39.11]I hear somebody sprinting.
[67:50.13]Get the fuck away from me.
[67:57.22]Do I need the torch?
[67:59.98]No, I have this.
[68:00.60]I'm just gonna drag it around with me.
[68:12.99]I- Be quiet!
[68:14.67]I'm standing in a gigantic halogen lightbulb!
[68:24.84]It's too dangerous to cook during the night.
[68:28.16]Close the door.
[68:28.94]I can't.
[68:30.28]Okay, I can.
[68:36.62]Close the door.
[68:37.20]That one is barricaded.
[68:39.14]Is there something going to come in here?
[68:45.73]I don't have any barricades.
[68:46.79]No.
[68:46.97]I don't even know what that means.
[68:53.59]Wait, somebody said the first night's not bad.
[68:55.59]What, is this like Five Nights at Freddy's?
[68:58.38]Is by like night four there's gonna be random fucking animatronics running around this house?
[69:12.71]Great.
[69:14.39]How many days?
[69:15.79]How many days until like somebody else has to take the shift?
[69:22.30]Look outside.
[69:23.02]I'm not looking outside.
[69:23.74]Someone's gonna grab me through the window.
[69:35.77]Nope.
[69:43.10]How do I know it's daytime?
[69:45.68]Look around the corner.
[69:47.96]Alright, I'm gonna bring my fucking light source with me so I don't get in trouble.
[70:02.30]Is this like holy water?
[70:03.24]Is this gonna burn them or something?
[70:05.48]Why is the music doing this?
[70:27.27]I did it!
[70:27.81]I survived a day!
[70:28.63]Alright, now turn the generator off.
[70:38.02]That's... Look at how fucking much... That's too much.
[70:40.74]I need gasoline.
[70:41.48]Okay.
[70:46.36]All it needs is to have to just go...
[71:03.25]Okay.
[71:04.31]Quickly, quickly.
[71:05.23]Wood legs.
[71:06.05]Nothing in there.
[71:06.97]I need to go.
[71:07.77]Now.
[71:09.21]Clock.
[71:10.07]Time freeze.
[71:10.83]Why do we need time freeze?
[71:11.73]Why is time frozen?
[71:12.85]I have like a time... I got a setup phase?
[71:16.18]There's an NPC in here.
[71:17.14]What?
[71:17.88]Where?
[71:22.88]Who the fuck is this?
[71:23.62]Wolfman.
[71:26.36]Even from afar, I can smell your putrid stench.
[71:29.88]Be glad I don't have an appetite for carcasses, meat.
[71:34.73]The figure hides its face under the hood.
[71:36.27]It smells of wet soil and fur.
[71:38.25]He's got like a machine gun.
[71:42.31]I know what you're after.
[71:43.83]I can help you reclaim what you've lost.
[71:46.07]If you help me attend a certain matter, what do you say, comrade?
[71:49.95]As he leans toward me, I can hear him giggling under the hood.
[71:55.15]I knew it would interest you.
[71:56.82]Before we make a deal, we need to prove that you can do the job.
[72:00.16]I have no time for weakling's meat.
[72:03.06]Do you follow?
[72:05.23]Show me what you're made of.
[72:06.29]Get through to the silent forest.
[72:08.91]You think it's so easy.
[72:10.42]If I were you, I would prepare myself well before setting out.
[72:14.58]When you get there, you will find me in this spot.
[72:17.26]Remember it.
[72:18.54]The wolf grabs you by the fucking shirt and rips you towards his face.
[72:22.16]The likes of you always crawl back to me.
[72:24.95]Okay.
[72:26.73]The wolf grabs my map and scribbles something on it.
[72:30.55]Show item.
[72:32.05]Is it even trade?
[72:35.91]Ooh.
[72:37.07]Beautiful item, perfect for a church fair.
[72:40.14]So you want it?
[72:42.30]Photo of the road.
[72:43.48]What's that you got there?
[72:44.76]The wolf snatches the photograph from my hand and studies it carefully.
[72:47.90]Finally, he snorts, his thick yellow spit landing on the photo.
[72:54.49]Aha!
[72:54.61]This road doesn't exist anymore, overgrown with trees like all the other ones.
[73:00.91]The wolf throws the photo to the ground.
[73:03.05]Before, better forget about the road home meat.
[73:06.85]Around here all the roads lead to nowhere.
[73:10.59]Whatever, I'll find my way out of here.
[73:12.62]Trade!
[73:14.08]Ooh, he's got a watch.
[73:15.58]How much money do I have?
[73:19.38]Where's my money?
[73:21.52]How much money do I have?
[73:22.40]Alright, I have three empty bottles.
[73:25.04]Is that enough for a gun?
[73:27.48]Handgun frame.
[73:30.70]Reputation is money.
[73:39.08]Tape.
[73:41.05]Is that free?
[73:42.59]Value?
[73:42.97]No.
[73:44.87]Chain.
[73:45.69]I buy weapons and ammo.
[73:46.83]Alright.
[73:49.25]I need this.
[73:50.09]150?
[73:51.07]I need a weapon.
[73:51.71]I need something.
[73:53.01]Here's gasoline.
[73:54.81]60.
[73:55.11]I don't have enough.
[73:56.89]Here, take a bottle.
[73:59.63]I don't want that shit.
[74:02.61]Um...
[74:10.26]I need to buy gasoline.
[74:13.10]Alcohol?
[74:16.30]Wait, I have other stuff.
[74:17.50]Wait, hold on.
[74:18.26]Tell me the story.
[74:20.20]I'd avoid getting in trouble if I were you, meat.
[74:22.18]Or at least until you get a decent weapon.
[74:25.64]If you wish to spend some more quality time basking in the striking yet natural beauty of my features before you head off to the Silent Forest, you will find me in my camp and though he's leaving.
[74:36.84]I- I wanna- hold on.
[74:38.88]Before you head off to the Silent Forest, you will find me in my camp in the Dry Meadow.
[74:43.10]Points to a location on my map.
[74:44.52]He's not gone, right?
[74:45.22]Alright, you're still here.
[74:46.12]Alright, give me a second.
[74:48.16]Just stay there.
[74:49.18]Where's my wardrobe?
[74:49.82]Alright, I got a bunch of- I got batteries, I got fuckin' pills.
[74:55.24]I got bullets and shit.
[74:56.63]What'd I just do?
[74:57.05]Okay.
[74:58.65]Where is it?
[74:58.99]Okay.
[75:00.47]I got metal, I got nails.
[75:04.01]Let's sell the battery.
[75:17.13]I need that gasoline.
[75:18.43]I just don't know what this does.
[75:22.33]Don't sell the nails.
[75:23.37]Okay, what about the bullet?
[75:24.10]20.
[75:24.68]Alright, that'll give me 50, that'll give me 60, 70.
[75:28.64]Enough for gasoline.
[75:32.32]That's one bullet.
[75:33.40]I'm not gonna be able to do shit.
[75:36.16]That's fine.
[75:36.64]Alright.
[75:37.02]Give me that.
[75:38.82]And I want a gasoline, please.
[75:45.29]What's happening?
[75:46.77]50 minus 40.
[75:47.03]Alright.
[75:47.87]Okay.
[75:49.33]The bullet is for you.
[75:50.29]What do you mean?
[75:51.63]Sell the bullet.
[75:52.39]Buy gasoline.
[75:55.91]Done.
[75:57.09]Thanks a lot.
[75:57.53]Appreciate the business.
[76:02.65]Now I'm gonna fill this shit up to all the way.
[76:08.17]I think.
[76:08.47]I don't know.
[76:10.23]Yeah?
[76:10.95]Should I... Halfway?
[76:12.15]Should I do this halfway?
[76:18.54]Halfway?
[76:19.50]Get it to half.
[76:28.04]Alright, that's at half.
[76:29.84]And then I've got other stuff to put gas on.
[76:33.38]Dump gasoline on ground to make fire.
[76:35.60]That's not a bad idea.
[76:36.85]Thanks for the tip.
[76:42.81]What else can I do?
[76:43.35]Alright, go over to this thing over here.
[76:51.35]Saw.
[76:52.45]Use.
[76:53.37]Is that the gasoline over there?
[76:54.43]That's the EXP bubbles down there.
[76:56.10]I'm going to fill this up to...
[77:12.23]Was I supposed to do that?
[77:13.65]I don't know.
[77:13.93]Was that supposed to happen?
[77:14.89]I don't know if I was supposed to... Convert wood logs to planks.
[77:17.55]Convert wood logs.
[77:23.08]Aren't there wood logs over here?
[77:28.04]Wood logs!
[77:29.14]How do you not have wood logs in a pile of wood logs?
[77:31.20]It's empty, but it's wood logs.
[77:32.44]There's wood logs there.
[77:33.36]Why would there not be wood logs on a pile of wood logs?
[77:35.14]What the fuck is this game talking about?
[77:41.88]In the pile of wood logs, there are no wood logs.
[77:47.69]There should be at least one.
[77:51.29]I gotta find wood logs.
[77:52.17]Alright, I'm gonna find some wood logs.
[77:55.53]There's the wolf's camp.
[77:57.25]Wolf's camp.
[77:58.99]Silent forest.
[78:00.49]There's like the portal.
[78:01.80]Alright, I'm gonna go to find wood logs.
[78:08.10]How do you get wood logs?
[78:08.94]Do I have to cut down trees?
[78:09.92]I don't have an axe.
[78:12.28]Are they just lying around?
[78:15.11]They're... Locked.
[78:21.35]Good thing I got a lockpick.
[78:22.61]Get it open!
[78:24.83]Ooh!
[78:26.13]Full container of gasoline!
[78:34.14]I heard a dog.
[78:38.68]This is my only weapon.
[78:39.44]I have to save it.
[78:41.04]Wait, can I hit people with a bottle?
[78:48.02]I think I can.
[78:48.62]But what if... Broken glass.
[78:52.40]Broken glass.
[78:53.12]Um... What are these pills?
[78:59.23]Oh, I could... Alright, I can't get the... If I step on the glass, it's gonna hurt me.
[79:03.31]This game seems pretty realistic.
[79:05.41]Wait, I need logs.
[79:06.35]Wait, I gotta go back.
[79:15.03]More gasoline.
[79:17.99]Okay, so gasoline is going to go into... I'm going to get rid of it.
[79:29.89]Do you eat glass?
[79:33.38]I know.
[79:33.86]I'm going to fill... I'm going to go just gasoline.
[79:42.20]I can, like, fill it up the whole way.
[79:43.46]Alright, let's do that.
[79:45.16]Right?
[79:45.36]That's probably not a bad idea.
[79:48.75]Gasoline here.
[79:49.49]Let's get it filled.
[79:50.39]At least enough where I'm comfortable with it.
[79:52.34]Because I'll have plenty of gas.
[80:00.12]I'm filling the whole thing up.
[80:07.53]Full tank.
[80:09.33]Full.
[80:10.79]Is it nighttime?
[80:11.79]What have I fucking done all day?
[80:13.05]What time is it?
[80:15.15]What time is it?
[80:23.76]Workshop.
[80:24.64]Oh, this is a huge inventory!
[80:27.71]Okay, just put everything in here.
[80:41.89]Um... Chain trap!
[80:48.28]No, I don't... Repair item.
[80:50.38]No.
[80:51.22]No.
[80:53.28]Okay, I need to put the syringe thing in here.
[80:58.36]Odd-looking mushroom.
[80:59.58]20 essence.
[80:59.94]30, 40, 50!
[81:00.28]I got it!
[81:01.73]It's on!
[81:04.95]What the hell is this?
[81:06.57]Staying in dark areas at night can be dangerous to me.
[81:09.15]Okay, alright.
[81:11.15]I can see far- This is a level-up system.
[81:13.09]This is how you level up.
[81:15.11]Okay, I can see further.
[81:17.78]Once a day, I'll be able to heal myself by standing next to an electric light source-
[81:23.88]Once a day I'll be able to learn my current location on the map.
[81:27.14]That's pretty... That's... I'll be able to heal myself by eating mushrooms.
[81:36.69]Any electric light, so it's going to be anything.
[81:42.33]I kind of like the first one.
[81:46.35]So I could just stay next to anything.
[81:49.80]Seeing further is important.
[81:52.84]I don't know.
[81:53.46]Either one of these two sounds really, really good.
[81:58.93]I would... If it was me, and because I'm stupid, I would pick this one if I was playing off stream because I don't have a fucking chat of 15,000 people to help me.
[82:07.82]So I don't even need this.
[82:10.16]Like, we can pretend that I already clicked this because I have you guys.
[82:13.16]So...
[82:24.83]I'm gonna just go where it takes me.
[82:25.99]It's done.
[82:26.35]I need to choose a negative perk.
[82:34.09]What do you mean a negative perk?
[82:35.92]What the fuck you... What do you mean a negative perk?
[82:37.64]I have to pick this one.
[82:41.50]What?
[82:43.24]Staying in dark areas at night can be dangerous to me.
[82:48.18]I like being on the sea, but I could heal...
[83:01.64]Done.
[83:02.60]It's over.
[83:02.92]I did it.
[83:04.36]See further.
[83:04.82]What's that mean?
[83:13.69]Does it mean like physically actually seeing over here or like the light goes further?
[83:18.60]Oh, that's not good.
[83:19.68]That's actually kind of bad.
[83:21.52]That's not good at all.
[83:22.62]This is terrible.
[83:23.60]What's the point of this?
[83:24.36]It's useless.
[83:25.70]Shouldn't have got it.
[83:26.20]I should have got the moth.
[83:27.87]Too late.
[83:28.81]Gotta sleep in your bed that you make.
[83:29.81]Alright.
[83:32.07]What time is it?
[83:32.57]I don't know.
[83:34.77]Let's go with... I got some bread.
[83:36.05]I got some bandages.
[83:36.89]Okay, let's go scavenge.
[83:39.17]This game's fun.
[83:40.50]I like this game.
[83:47.88]Alright, time to scavenge.
[83:48.72]What time is it?
[83:49.26]I don't know.
[83:52.14]He's coping.
[83:54.08]Actually, that's not bad.
[83:55.14]Because I can see pretty damn far.
[83:56.58]Alright, scavenge.
[84:04.43]Is it night time?
[84:07.99]I don't know.
[84:10.81]Dog's over here.
[84:11.42]Alright, easy.
[84:15.14]Burned house.
[84:15.78]Burned house.
[84:16.30]Alright, I can scavenge in this burned house.
[84:22.69]I don't know.
[84:23.01]Those dogs are in there.
[84:24.05]Dogs are there, but they can't get in the house.
[84:25.19]They don't have hands.
[84:27.73]What?
[84:28.73]It's an open door.
[84:32.89]Oh, fuck.
[84:47.56]How many fucking dogs are there?
[84:56.67]There's a tractor over here.
[84:58.03]There's a log.
[84:59.05]Alright, hold on.
[85:01.23]Oh!
[85:01.67]Gasoline and a tire.
[85:02.83]Nice.
[85:03.45]Dogs.
[85:04.71]Don't touch dogs.
[85:06.39]Just... Is this... That's not a light, right?
[85:10.63]Logs?
[85:17.49]There's debris over there.
[85:18.31]There's like a big wooden log over there.
[85:19.87]There's a pig too.
[85:56.02]There's nobody here.
[85:56.62]I'm fine.
[85:59.88]I got a log.
[86:03.62]Oh!
[86:06.64]What has he got?
[86:15.09]An ear?
[86:16.17]I don't know.
[86:18.55]Get the f- Don't do that.
[86:26.16]Shut up!
[86:26.78]Shut up!
[86:27.16]Shut up!
[86:27.44]Shut up!
[86:27.70]Shut up!
[86:33.23]I gotta- I'm out of here.
[86:34.05]I gotta leave.
[86:34.69]I'm out.
[86:35.53]Time to go.
[86:36.73]I gotta log.
[86:39.95]Okay, I gotta log.
[86:40.45]Where am I?
[86:42.05]Burnt house.
[86:42.41]Okay, I gotta pick- I gotta get like a weapon.
[86:45.54]What happened to me?
[86:46.12]What was that?
[86:46.60]What happened?
[86:47.12]Why am I sick?
[86:48.06]Why are my characters sick?
[86:49.62]Why is my character sick?
[86:51.68]Why is he sick?
[86:52.46]What happened?
[86:54.43]What's this ween?
[86:55.39]You're poisoned.
[86:55.93]How do I get rid of poison?
[86:57.69]Bandage?
[87:04.03]Alright, I'm back home.
[87:04.91]I gotta turn the lights on.
[87:06.27]Okay, I've got... Is it time for the lights?
[87:18.18]No, not yet.
[87:19.68]What do I got?
[87:20.04]I got a couple of planks.
[87:25.46]Alright, workbench.
[87:27.30]Board with nails.
[87:33.78]Got it.
[87:34.94]I got a weapon now.
[87:35.70]Okay.
[87:37.94]What does the ear do?
[87:38.64]Throwable.
[87:39.02]Can be used as bait for carnivores.
[87:40.48]Okay.
[87:43.32]I stole some gasoline.
[87:44.18]I'm gonna put it into the tank.
[87:46.84]Bottle.
[87:47.98]Let's store the tire because I don't know what the hell this is for.
[87:52.70]I'm gonna put on the board, I think.
[87:56.16]I guess.
[87:57.78]Yeah, good.
[87:58.98]Oh, now I feel like I'm ready.
[88:01.10]I need more bandages.
[88:02.84]Bandage with alcohol.
[88:05.70]Yeah, fuck it.
[88:06.18]Let's do it.
[88:08.44]Fuck it.
[88:08.76]Let's get it.
[88:10.54]I'm gonna eat this food.
[88:13.02]Does that do anything?
[88:14.06]Was that a stupid mistake?
[88:16.71]This is not like Minecraft.
[88:21.99]No, this doesn't heal you.
[88:22.74]Okay, that was dumb.
[88:30.36]I just have more stamina.
[88:31.76]Well... I will.
[88:33.30]Alright.
[88:34.00]Hotbar upgrade.
[88:34.76]I need to board up some... I only have two boards.
[88:37.16]Alright, I got a weapon.
[88:37.88]I'm fine.
[88:38.18]I'm just gonna stand next to the... Oh, fuck.
[88:41.95]Oh, fuck.
[88:42.23]Oh, fuck.
[88:42.45]I have to turn the light on.
[88:43.73]Turn on the lights now, please.
[88:45.19]Right?
[88:46.51]Turn on the light?
[88:47.55]Turn the light on.
[88:48.33]Turn on the light!
[88:48.85]It's... That's like... There's something happening.
[88:55.41]Oh, it's rain.
[88:55.97]It's raining.
[88:57.71]Alright, it's raining.
[88:58.47]What does that mean?
[89:03.94]I didn't mean to swing that.
[89:07.46]I thought it was like something zoning in.
[89:09.50]Like the sides of your screen are flickering and there's an animal or a bad monster or something.
[89:16.72]I'm just going to stand here.
[89:18.45]Until it's... I'm going to...
[89:24.18]Is that lightning or is that... Okay, that's lightning.
[89:26.76]I can't get struck by lightning, right?
[89:27.96]There's a roof here.
[89:37.08]You're doing a great overreacting to everything joke.
[89:41.73]I drank three coffees today.
[89:45.13]I can't help it.
[89:53.61]This is four.
[90:03.08]Should I just stay in here?
[90:03.92]I need to use my daytime.
[90:11.56]What's the actual... You know what else it is too?
[90:13.58]I have to talk louder because I'm blocking both my ears.
[90:18.66]It's like somebody has a vacuum cleaner on right now.
[90:29.14]Thank you.
[90:32.70]Nice work.
[90:33.02]You guys nailed it.
[90:42.17]Now, for those of you that are new, if I block both my ears, I, like, literally become useless.
[90:47.13]You know how, like, Superman has kryptonite, and he's, like, the most powerful entity on Earth?
[90:52.31]Right, but if you, like, hold a kryptonite crystal up to him, he just, like...
[90:57.38]That's what happens to me.
[90:58.04]Like, I could be the fucking strongest person on Earth.
[91:00.16]If you just covered both my ears, I'd be like... I'd be useless.
[91:10.37]You're not Superman.
[91:13.91]Egomaniac.
[91:15.21]That's my weakness.
[91:21.64]You're like a shark.
[91:22.72]What?
[91:27.19]Alright, is it night time?
[91:28.69]But the question I was going to ask is... How do you tell when... How much time is it for a day cycle in the game?
[91:37.19]An hour?
[91:38.25]30 minutes?
[91:38.51]20 minutes?
[91:40.14]How do I know?
[91:40.66]You can tell from your light, okay?
[91:49.76]You can find the watch.
[91:50.88]I could have bought a watch.
[91:57.83]When the light gets orange, that's when it's getting dark.
[92:01.43]Thank you so much for your incredible contribution.
[92:06.81]When grass is green, it's day.
[92:07.99]Grass orange, dusk.
[92:09.24]No color is night.
[92:10.32]Okay.
[92:14.24]So, I'm still good to go.
[92:17.68]I knew it was going to happen, too.
[92:18.84]And now this is where it gets fucking loud.
[92:25.27]And I've got the kryptonite on, too.
[92:47.57]Is this mushroom down here?
[92:53.75]Apparently there's a mushroom down here somewhere.
[93:05.84]Orange, orange, orange.
[93:07.06]Time to go.
[93:07.32]I forget where the house is.
[93:16.89]Oh no, where's the house?
[93:25.79]I'm gonna be honest, I'm too afraid to do anything.
[93:39.02]I'm too afraid to fucking do anything.
[93:43.31]I'm just going to wait until it's orange.
[93:45.93]Around here I thought it was orange.
[93:53.03]Barricade.
[93:53.43]I don't have any planks.
[93:58.11]It's a very quick Q. You have right to be antsy.
[94:04.41]Get wood to barricade.
[94:10.41]There's a storm outside.
[94:11.37]That's not smart.
[94:13.13]But where do you get wood?
[94:14.19]It's not just from the... simply like the trees, right?
[94:17.66]You just have to find it?
[94:25.14]This adult is scared of thunder.
[94:26.74]No, this adult is scared of loud ass noises that go in both ears at the same time while he's doing kryptonite to himself.
[94:36.07]Guys, I don't even listen to music in the car.
[94:42.79]I need my ears to see.
[94:46.37]Somebody... There's a scientific reason for it.
[94:48.86]I don't know what it's called.
[94:51.96]I swear to God.
[94:53.20]This is not a joke.
[94:56.08]I need my ears to be aware of where I am and shit.
[94:59.12]I swear to God.
[95:00.72]What is it called?
[95:09.99]Ecto... Ecto... Echolocation.
[95:13.95]I really think I have that.
[95:15.87]Because when my ears are blocked, I fucking like, it's hard for me to like, pay attention and see and stuff.
[95:21.15]I think I use echolocation like a bat.
[95:24.66]It's weird, because when I scream really loud, I can see better.
[95:31.98]It's weird.
[95:37.26]It's dark out now.
[95:38.02]Alright, I gotta turn it on, right?
[95:39.36]I'm done.
[95:39.66]I don't fucking know, guys.
[95:43.30]Orange means almost night.
[95:45.73]Right?
[95:46.63]I'm just trying to learn.
[95:48.25]Orange means it's almost nighttime.
[95:52.37]So when it's orange, that's when it's like, get the fuck inside.
[95:56.05]Get inside now, please.
[95:58.09]And then once this, this is a, it's like a green light, yellow light, and then red light.
[96:05.38]Now I know.
[96:05.84]Just needed to learn.
[96:10.50]You wasted an entire day.
[96:11.78]Congrats.
[96:13.20]Every single day it gets harder.
[96:15.20]You might need to restart.
[96:17.79]Wait, what do you mean every day it gets harder?
[96:20.69]Did I just really waste a whole... What did I do today?
[96:23.55]I don't know.
[96:24.11]Whatever.
[96:25.67]Does it really just get harder every day?
[96:30.41]I'm just waiting to turn on the generator.
[96:32.97]What was that sound?
[96:34.73]Is what I want to know.
[96:43.60]Don't let the chat backseat you.
[96:44.86]That's okay, though, because I have no idea what I'm doing.
[96:47.60]And this is a game that doesn't hold your hand.
[96:52.82]I'm just trying to see.
[96:53.76]Okay, so this is how long it takes.
[96:57.46]Alright.
[97:00.72]Turn on the generator.
[97:01.57]Not yet.
[97:03.91]Turn it on.
[97:04.71]Not yet, but it's still orange.
[97:06.57]Actually, it's becoming not orange.
[97:07.89]Okay, I'm going to turn it on now.
[97:12.26]Okay, now I'll turn it on because it's becoming faded.
[97:21.90]Where's the light?
[97:22.40]Where's that light?
[97:28.75]Okay, just stand next to this all day.
[97:32.45]What a waste of time.
[97:37.20]So if I just lock myself in the corner with the light facing out, I'm safe.
[97:47.05]Close the doors.
[97:47.89]The doors are closed.
[97:52.39]Close the doors.
[97:53.87]I don't know where they are.
[97:55.17]Which door is open?
[98:00.74]I'm terrified to go over here.
[98:04.70]Oven.
[98:07.38]Is that a person?
[98:08.16]I'm closing that.
[98:08.74]Just stand over here.
[98:20.94]Okay.
[98:21.96]This should be fine.
[98:23.72]This is how you die.
[98:31.41]This is not fine.
[98:45.21]How do you escape now?
[98:46.36]I'm not trying to escape right now.
[98:47.80]I'm trying to
[98:49.98]Guys, I didn't even have a weapon until 15 minutes ago.
[98:56.62]I was getting attacked by dogs and shit.
[99:13.70]Turn off the lamp.
[99:14.36]You won't.
[99:17.52]Don't ever tell me I won't do something.
[99:28.01]5 seconds.
[99:28.35]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[99:30.52]Turn off the lamp in 10 seconds.
[99:44.33]No.
[99:45.35]Something's coming now.
[99:52.47]Something's over here.
[99:57.28]Don't move.
[99:57.84]Is there a crouch?
[100:01.37]There's something out here walking around.
[100:03.05]What does that mean?
[100:13.45]Does it mean the mirror here?
[100:15.67]Oh god.
[100:16.59]This is not good.
[100:32.38]Something is lurking in the shadow.
[100:33.56]I should stay close to the light.
[100:36.12]I'm... I'm standing right next to the light.
[100:39.64]Oh, they're in the house now.
[100:40.58]They're in the house.
[100:41.12]The ghosts are in the house.
[100:45.82]Hey!
[100:46.02]Hey!
[100:46.26]Hey!
[100:46.88]Hey!
[100:48.32]What is it now?
[100:51.02]What happened?
[101:04.55]Why did that happen?
[101:06.78]What is that?
[101:07.44]What happened?
[101:36.80]A man roughly my size is standing before me.
[101:38.72]I can barely make out his disturbingly familiar features through the matte visor of his helmet.
[101:44.23]The massive helmet is covered with an old sack and seems to be an integral part of the unnaturally pale body.
[101:51.95]I remember him.
[101:53.71]He's the one who rescued me from the doctor's house.
[101:58.72]The man reaches out to me with his black hand.
[102:01.70]It's covered in charcoal.
[102:02.78]There's something written on his worn, woolen glove.
[102:06.22]We need to stick together, brother.
[102:10.06]His lips are moving, but all the sounds are drowned inside the helmet.
[102:12.95]He shrugs and takes the huge sack off his back and drops it on the ground, revealing its contents.
[102:19.81]Photo of the road.
[102:20.47]He wipes his left glove on his pants, takes out the charcoal from his pocket, and starts scribbling.
[102:25.84]When he finishes, he lifts his dirty hand.
[102:28.22]All roads lead deeper into the woods.
[102:35.66]Okay.
[102:37.38]He's got a lot of boards.
[102:43.87]Medium... What are you guys linking?
[102:45.61]What is this?
[102:56.20]He stole the gun.
[103:02.02]It looks... I mean, it looks like... No, guys.
[103:09.36]I'm telling you.
[103:10.77]Let me tell you something.
[103:14.05]I'll show you.
[103:15.99]This is the kind of internal reaction you have...
[103:20.15]when you realize that, like, the movie you're watching with your parents, you get to the scene that has, like, the pornography in it.
[103:29.96]And this is what you're thinking internally, and my face came as what you're actually, like, presenting to everybody in the family that's sitting there watching.
[104:02.07]I look fucking like a hundred years old.
[104:05.35]Every time, I can't, I gotta stop moving my skin.
[104:08.51]Cause when I sit here like this, I could be 20.
[104:12.58]Anytime I make any emotion, I turn 40.
[104:22.24]Thanks for that, by the way.
[104:22.96]Alright, let me keep going.
[104:32.50]So, uh, this is me.
[104:34.23]I just died, right?
[104:35.11]So this is me with the... I got, like, oven mitts on or something.
[104:37.95]I got a bolt handle.
[104:41.23]Hold still so they don't see your age.
[104:42.85]Yeah, it's a weird superpower.
[104:46.53]Then when I stand still, I de-age by, like, 10 years.
[104:51.91]I couldn't be 20.
[104:52.55]What an egomaniac.
[104:53.49]Oh, fine.
[104:54.33]Alright, I still have... What happens here?
[104:56.56]So, I have no money.
[104:57.80]Because, whatever.
[105:00.86]I can't do anything.
[105:01.44]Alright, now I'm going to prepare completely because now I understand the game.
[105:05.52]I still have my board.
[105:06.42]I'm going to get boards.
[105:08.65]What's in here?
[105:09.37]I've got gasoline.
[105:10.29]How much gasoline do I have?
[105:11.47]I've got to go find boards.
[105:13.59]I've got a plank.
[105:14.27]I can hit stuff.
[105:15.17]I'm ready.
[105:15.49]Okay.
[105:18.97]How much gas do I have?
[105:19.97]Plenty.
[105:21.27]Just totally plenty.
[105:22.43]Alright, let's go.
[105:27.00]The lighting's weird in your room.
[105:28.03]If you fix it, you might look younger.
[105:29.21]I gotta turn off the generator.
[105:37.91]Alright, it's daytime.
[105:38.71]We're good.
[105:39.13]Now I understand how the day and night cycle works.
[105:42.45]I'm gonna bring a little bit of food.
[105:43.49]I'm gonna bring just some bandages.
[105:45.25]I'm gonna go scavenge and get boards to put all over the place.
[105:49.25]Alright.
[105:53.23]Store this shit.
[105:54.72]I'm gonna take this.
[105:55.56]I'm gonna bring out... Fuck, I don't know.
[106:01.50]Heal?
[106:03.10]A pill?
[106:05.08]I'm always afraid to make mistakes in these games.
[106:10.60]I need a bandage.
[106:11.69]I need two rags.
[106:15.99]Prioritize the bedroom.
[106:17.59]I'll try.
[106:18.11]Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go.
[106:21.33]I'm gonna go.
[106:21.67]I'm going for it.
[106:22.15]Let's go.
[106:22.75]I have to just get stuff.
[106:23.51]Prioritize the bed.
[106:24.10]What's the bedroom?
[106:25.56]All these rooms are all fucked up.
[106:27.06]Which one is the bedroom?
[106:27.88]I have no idea.
[106:28.68]That one?
[106:29.02]Okay, let's go.
[106:33.96]The one with the bed.
[106:35.52]Okay.
[106:35.76]I'm going for it.
[106:38.00]Let's go.
[106:38.38]I got a plank.
[106:39.16]I'm ready to defend myself.
[106:42.52]What do we got?
[106:42.98]I'm gonna check out this burned house.
[106:53.12]There we go.
[106:54.22]Alright.
[106:55.05]Broken glass.
[106:55.73]Let's get it.
[107:00.23]Maybe I can use it for something.
[107:03.22]It's a trap.
[107:03.84]Alright, nice.
[107:04.52]Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[107:05.88]Let's go.
[107:07.28]Got plenty of daylight.
[107:08.86]Burned house.
[107:09.46]I got my plank.
[107:10.68]I can hit the random things that attack me.
[107:16.02]Alright, like right now.
[107:17.88]I'm ready.
[107:23.32]Two dogs.
[107:24.86]Four dogs.
[107:28.40]Is that too many?
[107:28.98]There might be six.
[107:30.47]Is there six dogs?
[107:31.19]There's a camp over here.
[107:34.11]I have to do this.
[107:34.67]Uh-oh.
[107:42.58]What the fuck was that?
[107:44.46]It's the... I didn't... Okay, that's what it looks like.
[107:47.28]God damn it.
[107:50.98]I didn't even... I couldn't even fucking tell.
[107:56.26]I need to check in here.
[108:03.65]Can they see me?
[108:05.01]Oh no, I'm gonna die again.
[108:08.73]There's like seven of them.
[108:12.45]Get out of here!
[108:13.55]Wait.
[108:17.29]No, no, no, give me the meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.
[108:19.21]Hurry up, get in your fucking inventory.
[108:20.79]Hurry up!
[108:26.09]How do I throw it down?
[108:26.99]How do I give them the meat?
[108:28.95]How do I give them the meat?
[108:30.11]Okay, no, I have the meat.
[108:31.19]That's why they're coming over here.
[108:38.56]Oh my god.
[108:39.49]No.
[108:43.03]It's not gonna work out.
[108:48.55]Throw the meat.
[108:49.32]I was trying to.
[108:50.02]Does it hold right?
[108:51.08]How do you throw this shit on the ground?
[108:53.74]What the hell am I doing?
[109:06.25]You have to hold it for like two or three seconds.
[109:09.02]To put it in your fucking hand.
[109:11.70]You have to go... Alright, I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing here.
[109:22.68]Trying to find wood.
[109:24.44]But apparently this is the dogpocalypse.
[109:27.68]It's all dogs.
[109:28.50]It's only dogs.
[109:32.66]The animals took over.
[109:38.84]I gotta go a different way.
[109:42.64]Don't step on these- these are poisonous mushrooms.
[109:57.09]No weapon?
[109:57.67]I got a weapon.
[109:59.65]I need to heal though.
[110:09.95]I need logs.
[110:10.85]You would think that logs would be the easiest thing in the whole game to find.
[110:13.88]There's trees everywhere.
[110:17.70]Why is it like finding ammo in Resident Evil?
[110:22.49]How come I've not seen any logs?
[110:48.97]Can I get a log?
[110:50.19]Okay.
[110:51.49]There's a tree.
[110:53.69]A fallen tree.
[110:54.29]It's bark looks chewed up.
[111:03.24]Hit it.
[111:05.04]It's not doing anything.
[111:21.59]Okay.
[111:22.39]I'm gonna- That's not a log.
[111:26.36]It's like a chest.
[111:31.42]There's treasure chests lying around, but no logs.
[111:38.45]Did I get like a shitty seed?
[111:53.15]There's more bear traps than logs!
[112:03.68]Oh my god, finally.
[112:06.84]Wooden logs.
[112:15.23]That's it?
[112:20.91]Thank god, finally.
[112:22.33]Stumps.
[112:34.62]Stone to... Alright, so I got... Getting there.
[112:39.66]Okay, how many... How many logs do I need to make enough planks to survive?
[112:44.58]I have... Six.
[112:50.53]Did I miss a pile?
[113:02.60]There we go.
[113:05.76]Alright.
[113:06.52]I'm fucking off.
[113:07.38]I'm out of here.
[113:09.81]I'm over here at the log pile.
[113:11.87]Over at the hideout.
[113:12.49]Let's go.
[113:16.79]Trap.
[113:23.20]I missed the... What do you mean the biggest pile?
[113:25.16]I missed a pile?
[113:26.58]How did I do that?
[113:33.46]This one right here?
[113:34.14]That's not...
[113:36.95]Oh, I thought, I didn't think this was, I thought they had to be the little, like, rabbit pellets.
[113:42.84]Okay, I'm good.
[113:51.56]Wait, chest, I need to, okay.
[113:53.38]Just get me out of here.
[114:00.19]There's a lot of these random crates.
[114:04.69]So now I board up the windows.
[114:07.75]And then make sure that I have light in the bedroom.
[114:14.46]More piles, thank god.
[114:17.84]This is just a wood... This is just for getting as much wood as I can carry.
[114:22.28]I got no more room.
[114:34.39]I'm out.
[114:34.81]I gotta go.
[114:35.95]What is this?
[114:38.17]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[114:39.43]I'm fine.
[114:39.73]I'm fine.
[114:39.97]I'm fine.
[114:41.25]I hear a dog somewhere.
[114:42.22]I'm gonna kill it.
[114:43.38]I'm gonna kill this dog.
[114:43.98]I'm gonna kill the dog.
[114:45.46]There's only one dog, right?
[114:46.52]Kill it.
[114:47.98]There's only one dog.
[114:50.76]Kill it, I guess.
[114:52.46]Don't.
[114:52.68]I had one here.
[114:54.46]I fucking missed.
[114:58.97]Alright, alright.
[115:01.01]I'll give you the ear.
[115:02.39]Give you the dog's ear.
[115:06.38]What happened to it?
[115:13.99]I had to do that.
[115:15.19]There's nothing else I could do.
[115:17.73]Where the hell am I?
[115:26.05]I think I'm going the wrong way.
[115:26.87]Okay, up from here.
[115:40.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not right now.
[115:49.42]Okay, alright, we're here.
[115:52.53]Alright, so now get in here.
[115:56.85]Thank God.
[116:00.93]I have nothing to cook, right?
[116:01.97]No mushrooms.
[116:03.43]Turn the logs into planks.
[116:13.18]So, wood logs to planks.
[116:18.75]25 fuel.
[116:19.75]How many should I do?
[116:22.19]Just... Is that a good idea?
[116:25.73]All of them.
[116:27.79]I... Uh...
[116:42.42]Okay, I have 16 planks.
[116:48.62]Okay, now windows first, right?
[116:52.00]Which windows?
[116:53.52]Bedroom windows first?
[116:59.68]Window.
[117:00.57]Bingo.
[117:02.09]Barricade.
[117:05.09]I need... Let's go.
[117:11.63]This one too.
[117:20.11]And then this one?
[117:25.90]Good.
[117:28.14]What's that?
[117:28.60]Alright, let's just throw up in my mouth.
[117:31.16]I don't know why I told you that.
[117:35.08]Do you have air?
[117:35.66]No.
[117:45.33]In the corner of the bedroom.
[117:52.96]I didn't know there was a backpack back here.
[117:59.45]Can you honk in this game?
[118:00.67]That'd be awesome if you could.
[118:02.21]Okay, so this is fine.
[118:04.97]Now I need... Don't do that.
[118:07.67]What about over here?
[118:09.31]Is this okay?
[118:10.05]Is that blocking that?
[118:24.07]Push the furniture in front of the door.
[118:25.31]Alright, barricaded window.
[118:26.39]That's barricaded.
[118:28.96]So this has to stay here, though.
[118:31.56]Because look, I mean, is that blocking this?
[118:34.58]Can I get confirmed?
[118:36.76]Am I now safe?
[118:40.52]Okay.
[118:41.68]So they can't get in now.
[118:43.86]Door, close the doors.
[118:45.76]Lock up.
[118:50.32]The only way you can get in is from here.
[118:51.68]But should I... I'm just gonna barricade this door.
[118:56.29]Put the stool in front of the door.
[118:59.65]Yeah.
[119:08.68]So that's blocking that door.
[119:11.28]I don't think I have any more furniture.
[119:12.40]Can I make furniture?
[119:13.28]Okay.
[119:26.00]Drop your traps.
[119:28.29]Do I have traps on me?
[119:31.31]Oh, okay, trap.
[119:33.05]Uh... Broken glass.
[119:40.41]Where should I put it?
[119:41.99]In front of... In front of a window?
[119:45.64]In front of one of the doors?
[119:46.52]Should I put it, like, over here?
[119:52.60]Right in front of the front door.
[120:07.10]What?
[120:08.12]Outside the front door.
[120:12.96]It's like here.
[120:26.61]Like... Wait, am I gonna step on this?
[120:38.31]Oh shit, the well.
[120:39.37]I need... Oh shit.
[120:41.83]Um... I need gasoline.
[120:44.49]Where's my gas?
[120:51.34]Give me my gas.
[120:57.98]I can remake this.
[120:58.82]Okay, give me the gas on this hot bar here.
[121:10.34]Make some more wood.
[121:15.22]Here we go.
[121:15.90]Okay.
[121:18.71]What does the well do for me?
[121:19.57]Give me fresh water?
[121:25.81]Okay.
[121:26.44]So... Oh.
[121:30.94]Nice.
[121:31.30]Okay.
[121:31.56]So I can heal.
[121:33.34]Is this infinite?
[121:42.34]Okay, I can keep these in here.
[121:43.91]Now, let's put the glass down.
[121:47.35]Once per day.
[121:47.89]That's useful.
[121:48.53]Okay, so... I'm going to put it here and then close the door.
[122:05.50]No, they can't get it.
[122:07.02]It's orange.
[122:07.50]Alright.
[122:08.04]Did I do this right?
[122:09.78]Oh, wait, wait.
[122:10.80]I have to turn the generator on right now.
[122:13.56]I didn't turn the generator on.
[122:14.52]Where's the light?
[122:19.34]Where's the lamp?
[122:20.34]Okay, let's just turn it on.
[122:21.56]Okay, there's plenty of gas.
[122:31.13]We're fine.
[122:37.40]Did you just write GTA 2 is lame?
[122:39.32]What does that have to do with anything?
[122:41.70]Okay, this is blocked.
[122:46.94]I think I'm safe now.
[122:51.21]I'm safe, I think.
[122:52.83]I should be.
[122:53.27]I gotta take my plank out just in case somebody gets in here.
[123:05.20]And the torch.
[123:05.98]Alright.
[123:07.26]I'm ready for a fight.
[123:13.41]Bring the other light in.
[123:14.35]What do you mean the other light?
[123:15.51]There's another light?
[123:18.82]Put two lamps in the bedroom.
[123:24.40]Um...
[123:35.26]Okay, here we go.
[123:35.98]It's happening.
[123:36.50]It's happening right now.
[123:37.14]So I gotta... Put all the lights in the bedroom.
[123:48.59]That's where I'm going.
[123:49.19]I'm going.
[123:49.47]I'm going.
[123:49.75]I'm moving.
[123:50.15]I'm moving.
[123:50.37]I'm moving.
[123:52.55]Alright, everything's barricaded.
[123:53.81]I've got two lamps.
[123:54.95]I've got the generator running.
[123:56.15]And I have my... I've got traps outside the front door.
[123:58.54]I've got everything boarded up.
[124:06.36]One guy.
[124:06.80]You don't have a roof.
[124:15.95]There's no roofs in this game.
[124:22.87]Close the door.
[124:23.43]Alright, they can't get in any other way, right?
[124:28.68]Let's board it up.
[124:31.42]It's all boarded up.
[124:32.06]Alright, I'm ready.
[124:37.81]Barricade the door now.
[124:40.22]Yeah?
[124:55.43]Should I not have that?
[125:00.05]I'm just locking myself in the bedroom completely.
[125:03.14]Now I'm trapped.
[125:07.37]Put the lamp on the door.
[125:08.57]I can dismantle it.
[125:16.33]It's okay.
[125:18.54]Alright.
[125:19.10]I should be fine.
[125:19.72]Now what do I have to do?
[125:27.78]I still need to go over to the secret silent forest.
[125:37.43]Okay, I can do it.
[125:39.35]Don't stand near the windows.
[125:46.77]I can hear something skittering around.
[126:14.88]What if I don't see another door either?
[126:28.15]I'm good.
[126:30.19]I'm good.
[126:35.87]They can't get over here.
[126:36.63]They don't even know I'm in here.
[126:37.63]It's all barricaded up.
[126:48.16]What's that thing?
[126:49.84]Why is there a demon in here?
[126:51.84]Why is there a demon in here?
[126:54.27]What do I do?
[126:54.99]What do I do about that?
[126:55.63]What do I do?
[126:55.99]Touch it?
[126:57.31]I picked it up.
[126:57.73]What does it do?
[127:07.30]Eat it.
[127:26.86]Um, okay.
[127:28.14]I ate it.
[127:28.56]I think it was a heal, apparently.
[127:32.32]I don't know why somebody just said eat it and I just clicked it.
[127:38.03]I just don't remember looking at chat.
[128:10.00]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[128:11.20]Wait, here come the ghosts.
[128:12.18]Are they gonna turn off both lamps?
[128:13.84]I gotta move the lamp.
[128:14.44]I have to move the lamp out of the room.
[128:18.26]Yep, they turned off that lamp.
[128:19.14]It's okay.
[128:24.79]They can't get in here though, right?
[128:26.13]Ghosts can move through walls.
[128:30.95]Ghosts can move through walls.
[128:32.83]How do I combat a ghost moving through a fucking wall?
[128:35.96]How do I...
[128:49.43]I'm good.
[128:53.39]They can't move through the walls.
[128:54.53]Things you can't kill are afraid of the light, usually.
[129:00.84]I made it.
[129:01.14]Quick, turn both lamps off.
[129:15.89]Okay, I almost just died from this.
[129:30.62]Day four?
[129:31.34]I thought it was day two.
[129:32.28]I thought it was day two.
[129:36.23]Is it day four?
[129:38.31]When did it become day four?
[129:43.23]Okay.
[129:43.57]Let's turn the generator off.
[129:47.85]I have to get out of the room.
[129:57.84]Where's my bed?
[129:58.34]It's right here?
[129:58.66]Alright, I got some time here.
[130:00.72]The trader's back.
[130:01.76]I got 100 trader reputation gold.
[130:06.90]I noticed a smile on his face through the matte visor of his helmet.
[130:09.45]The man nods in greeting.
[130:11.79]Show item.
[130:12.71]Okay, trade.
[130:17.64]wish I had whatever the hell that demon dropped.
[130:19.56]That'd be nice.
[130:28.21]Axe blade.
[130:28.81]I don't have any money.
[130:43.40]Stop biting your lip.
[130:44.54]That's a bad habit.
[130:46.64]I could get gas.
[130:54.22]Save it for the watch.
[131:00.19]Yeah, that is useful.
[131:04.29]Shotgun.
[131:04.97]Yeah, I feel like the... Maybe later on when you survive one night so you get more money or something, but... I can barely walk around with a stick with nails on it.
[131:15.61]Get some wires.
[131:17.11]I think I have some wires, don't I?
[131:23.37]I gotta move this, though, so I can turn off the generator.
[131:29.37]Better off finding stuff, yeah.
[131:30.65]I got plenty of gas.
[131:41.92]Alright, move this back.
[131:42.96]Don't get me too far.
[131:45.22]You're right here.
[131:53.46]Alright, up.
[131:55.26]And... Workbench.
[131:58.36]Board with nails.
[131:59.78]Torch.
[132:01.80]I still have a little bit of torch left.
[132:03.08]I don't know, what the hell... Just dump all this in here.
[132:10.41]Okay, lockpick.
[132:14.23]I do need the wire.
[132:15.55]No, that's... Oh, that's a different kind of curly squiggly thing.
[132:19.95]That's rope and that's wire.
[132:21.07]I need two wires.
[132:24.36]Put the nails in there, too.
[132:29.00]Upgrade the workbench.
[132:32.77]Oh, shit.
[132:33.37]I'll be able to craft more items and fit more upgrades into weapons when I upgrade my workbench.
[132:37.13]Oh, let's do it.
[132:42.42]Okay.
[132:43.54]Ooh!
[132:44.92]Ooh!
[132:59.17]I need a barrel.
[133:03.16]Lantern?
[133:04.80]How long does it last?
[133:10.50]Okay.
[133:15.58]Waiting to see the final time on the speedrun.
[133:17.18]Probably 16 hours and 42 minutes.
[133:24.80]Should I just buy these?
[133:26.72]I think I'm gonna buy two of them.
[133:31.68]But I need... I'll go look for them.
[133:41.63]I'm gonna go explore.
[133:45.99]I'm gonna bring some meat with me.
[133:52.38]I think I have a couple pieces, right?
[133:53.74]Yeah.
[133:54.98]Bring this.
[133:55.44]I have a bandage.
[133:57.60]I have... I don't know if I can think of pills, too, don't I?
[134:03.23]Rag and alcohol.
[134:04.03]Can I make... No.
[134:06.83]How do I make a rag?
[134:08.85]Toothcloth, right.
[134:15.12]I'm just gonna go.
[134:17.50]I'm going to go... I need to go, like, down here.
[134:23.23]Or, no!
[134:23.85]I... The underground... It's been like two and a half hours!
[134:25.87]I was supposed to go this way!
[134:27.25]Underground entrance!
[134:27.95]What am I... I have to go in the underground entrance!
[134:36.74]I forgot that was part of the... Alright, let's go.
[134:46.68]Alright, here we go.
[134:47.72]Underground entrance.
[134:49.58]This loud rain, I... Sorry, I can't hear you.
[134:53.81]Already there's a dog.
[134:58.19]I want nothing to do with this dog.
[135:02.95]I could buy a shotgun.
[135:04.11]I can only shoot it one time, which I will miss.
[135:07.43]I won't hit the thing I'm aiming at, and it'll be a waste of money.
[135:15.29]Alright, there's that hole.
[135:25.44]What's in here?
[135:31.94]Wait.
[135:33.48]How do I get in here?
[135:38.33]Climb in the window, right?
[135:43.89]Alright, get in the underground lair.
[135:52.17]I hear mushroom noises.
[135:55.63]Here we go.
[136:01.40]Alright.
[136:02.40]I actually do not remember what I was supposed to do down here, but I'm just going to go down here.
[136:07.24]I guess.
[136:12.99]This is... Go through the underground passage.
[136:14.79]This is the Bloodmoor.
[136:16.61]This is the Find the Den of Evil of this game, and I'm just barely doing it now.
[136:22.50]Motorcycle magazine.
[136:25.86]An automotive magazine, okay.
[136:27.10]Maybe I can sell it?
[136:36.22]I needed another torch.
[136:38.02]It's alright.
[136:42.38]There's no map down here either.
[136:46.62]What was that?
[136:47.38]Is it a dog?
[136:48.46]Of course it is.
[136:49.00]Dogs everywhere.
[137:04.77]You motherfucker.
[137:13.81]What is that?
[137:14.42]There's like a light over here.
[137:26.30]Mushroom.
[137:30.47]This part of the passage is blocked by overgrown roots.
[137:33.35]Smash it!
[137:46.36]There's gonna be like a sacrificial fucking circle over here.
[137:54.12]Armored door.
[137:57.14]Locked.
[137:57.40]It's my only way out.
[137:58.22]I won't be able to open it without my key.
[138:00.14]Look at the handle.
[138:01.01]Press your ear against the keyhole.
[138:04.63]Hatch handle is covered in a thick layer of dust.
[138:06.41]It hasn't been opened for at least two weeks.
[138:11.82]I can hear faint voice throughout the howling wind.
[138:13.80]It sounds familiar.
[138:14.44]It seems to be coming through the keyhole.
[138:15.78]Someone's calling me.
[138:19.68]The hat channel is covered in a thick layer of dust.
[138:21.66]It hasn't been open for at least two weeks.
[138:26.29]Look through the keyhole.
[138:35.59]Uh... I don't have a key?
[138:43.44]Is this the way I leave the game?
[138:49.16]Oh.
[138:49.88]This is how you actually win.
[138:54.16]Interesting.
[138:55.04]Okay.
[138:55.56]Well, I'm on my way back, which means now I'm gonna get... I knew it.
[138:59.46]I knew it.
[138:59.80]I'm just gonna run.
[139:00.32]I think I'm gonna run.
[139:02.16]I think I'm just gonna run.
[139:05.06]Ah, I was down.
[139:06.42]And then left.
[139:06.88]Is there gonna be a monster here or something?
[139:08.88]I don't know.
[139:09.27]I only have a little bit more of my torch.
[139:12.86]Oh, fellow god.
[139:30.48]They are so powerful.
[139:32.48]Run.
[139:32.98]Just run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[139:45.75]Jesus.
[139:56.72]Oh, it's getting dark.
[139:57.74]It's getting dark outside.
[139:58.72]It's nighttime now.
[140:00.04]I think it's nighttime right now.
[140:02.04]Is it nighttime right now?
[140:13.33]No, not yet.
[140:13.79]Okay.
[140:17.32]Oh, I do have mushrooms to deposit.
[140:26.91]Oh god.
[140:49.12]Where's this little dog?
[140:53.28]Alright, I'm good.
[140:53.72]I'm good.
[140:53.94]I made it.
[140:54.22]I made it.
[140:54.76]Nice.
[140:56.00]Okay, let's put these mushrooms in.
[140:57.28]How many more do I need?
[141:04.96]Let's see.
[141:06.32]Ten essence.
[141:08.06]Ten.
[141:08.70]Ten.
[141:09.14]Okay.
[141:10.28]Not bad.
[141:15.38]so I can't actually can't go down there yet but I can make another board with nails what a repair item is what it's four okay it's one in five to make a new one it's two and ten so you just want to keep this repaired I don't think I need to do that yet though
[141:43.26]Okay, I've got a battery, some more planks.
[141:47.46]Some meat in there.
[141:48.46]Alright, looks good.
[141:49.31]I just want to let you know that you're doing great.
[141:54.87]Hey, thanks.
[141:55.29]I appreciate that.
[142:02.20]Can I make another lamp?
[142:08.62]Okay.
[142:10.26]Somebody said this is a useless emote, the new one.
[142:12.46]I know.
[142:13.78]The only reason why that's serious is because I didn't want to do a 24-hour stream.
[142:16.48]Last night I said... Last night.
[142:18.75]Sorry, what I meant to say was three days ago.
[142:21.39]I said if I didn't have that here by the next stream, then I would have to do a 24-hour stream.
[142:24.97]So I only did it so I didn't have to do that.
[142:29.81]Alright.
[142:31.31]Now what?
[142:32.42]I think now I just have to chill.
[142:40.20]The generator's not on.
[142:48.24]Die time, no.
[142:52.72]You have time?
[142:53.34]Okay, yeah.
[142:54.28]It's just the rain.
[142:56.54]Alright, I'm gonna go down to the lower right just for a little bit and see if I can grab any new supplies.
[143:12.77]Find new place.
[143:14.61]What's this?
[143:27.00]A farm?
[143:29.56]Farmland?
[143:31.70]Wedding.
[143:36.52]Wedding.
[143:42.45]Just like a maze?
[143:43.37]Hold on, don't fucking be an idiot here.
[143:59.88]What is over here?
[144:00.68]Oh shit, there's a place.
[144:09.04]Okay.
[144:20.54]Just one dog?
[144:21.48]Oh, it's a dog.
[144:23.30]Okay, that dog can't hurt me.
[144:24.98]Gonna be gas in here, right?
[144:33.71]No gas or anything on the car?
[144:36.44]Nothing here?
[144:36.92]No way.
[144:49.31]I- I have to do this quick.
[144:52.17]I- I have- I had- I had to- I had to- I'm sorry, I had to do that.
[145:00.11]Otherwise he'd kill me.
[145:12.21]What's on the table?
[145:13.85]What is that, nothing?
[145:16.49]What is going on in here?
[145:18.75]The tor- An old wagon.
[145:25.39]Decorated with cove ribs and flowers made of white tissue paper.
[145:30.91]Alright, I gotta go.
[145:35.39]Chair, no.
[145:39.26]Come on, like a box or something in here.
[145:40.74]Anything.
[145:44.70]Food, anything.
[145:45.44]A box.
[145:51.01]Is it?
[145:52.23]Stop?
[145:52.45]What do you mean stop?
[145:52.96]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[145:53.60]I have to leave.
[145:55.80]I have to leave.
[145:56.82]I have to get out of here now.
[145:59.28]Oh my god.
[145:59.86]Oh my god, what's happening?
[146:00.82]What the fuck is that?
[146:03.00]It's orange, right?
[146:03.84]I gotta go.
[146:06.29]I'll come back here another time.
[146:12.87]It's not orange yet.
[146:18.47]I wish I had a torch.
[146:25.99]Something's banging.
[146:28.07]I need combo to get in there.
[146:31.11]What is with this placement of barrels?
[147:03.37]I'm going to get stuck in here and it's going to be really bad.
[147:06.49]Yeah, I'm like getting stuck in here.
[147:12.26]I can't get stuck in this shit right now.
[147:15.14]I'm stuck in here now.
[147:19.14]Fantastic.
[147:19.64]I don't even know how I got in here.
[147:26.73]Destroyed well.
[147:28.43]Good, I got one piece of rope.
[147:29.77]Awesome.
[147:30.29]Excellent.
[147:33.28]I'm surprised there's nothing else in here.
[147:56.07]I can't.
[147:56.55]I need a combination to get over there.
[148:07.97]I need a combination to get over here.
[148:09.67]And light.
[148:12.05]What the fuck was that?
[148:12.91]I just can't see anything.
[148:21.25]And you're telling me there's nothing in the doghouse?
[148:26.53]Wait.
[148:30.47]No, more of these random logs in the way.
[148:32.53]Is there a faster way to get out of this than down here?
[148:42.45]I just gotta go up to the right.
[148:56.26]No, do I... I have to go through this again.
[148:59.18]How do I get out?
[149:03.23]I do not remember how I got in here.
[149:06.33]I think it was from up.
[149:14.09]Oh, no.
[149:14.99]This way?
[149:22.16]Oh, you motherfucker.
[149:34.48]Alright, let's go.
[149:35.12]Let's go.
[149:35.40]Let's go.
[149:35.70]I'm fine.
[149:38.88]Top left.
[149:39.56]Just move this way.
[149:40.54]Watch out for dogs.
[149:42.14]Turn on the generator.
[149:48.79]Stamina.
[149:49.25]Get it back.
[149:49.67]Come on.
[149:52.85]Thank you for clapping for me.
[149:53.89]Alright, I'm here.
[150:02.03]Alright, I'm good.
[150:04.01]I didn't learn anything new.
[150:05.35]I didn't get anything new.
[150:08.74]I guess just survive again and run this way tomorrow.
[150:16.54]I guess.
[150:18.43]I got rope.
[150:20.61]That's not gonna do shit for me.
[150:27.43]How do I get back in my fucking house?
[150:32.21]wait mushroom remains somebody's in your room you mean in the video game room or in like the actual room because I'm too scared to turn around I have to turn on the generator not quite yet though it's still alright
[151:03.42]Alright, uh... Everything's still barricaded.
[151:08.90]I'm gonna... I'm gonna repair this.
[151:21.07]Just so it's... Why is it red now?
[151:26.80]Okay.
[151:30.08]This is fine.
[151:30.84]This is fine.
[151:32.83]I can drink from the well tomorrow.
[151:35.79]Uh, doorway.
[151:36.51]Repair the doorway.
[151:39.73]Wait, somebody got in here?
[151:49.16]That's not good.
[151:51.64]Was it always broken?
[151:52.80]Oh.
[151:55.34]I think I'm alright then.
[151:58.53]Alright, we're getting to be close to nighttime here.
[152:01.53]Is there anything else I can do?
[152:02.69]Alright, so the goal for tomorrow is to go down here.
[152:09.91]Try to make at least somewhat of progress going down this way.
[152:12.45]Alright.
[152:27.96]I need lockpicks too, but I can't find any wiring.
[152:41.44]Turn off the lights and play in the dark.
[152:44.53]It's 4.30 in the afternoon in Las Vegas.
[152:48.51]That's not going to work.
[152:50.65]You're going to have to wait another couple hours.
[152:56.75]I have no more gas either.
[153:00.23]I actually really don't like this, what's happening right now.
[153:02.57]Because I don't have any more gas.
[153:05.47]Close my blinds.
[153:07.01]They're closed already.
[153:08.67]The sun is huge out here.
[153:11.01]You're way close to the sun.
[153:12.09]For those of you who don't know, Las Vegas is in the mountains.
[153:14.37]So it's like 4,000 feet elevated closer to the sun.
[153:16.97]That's why it looks bigger.
[153:18.81]That's why it's hotter.
[153:25.05]Nothing else?
[153:25.47]It's not that one of these mazes...
[153:32.71]Something small I can just grab right here.
[153:37.26]No, it's too risky.
[153:49.26]It's amazing that literally nothing I just said was correct.
[153:55.43]Whatever.
[153:56.47]There is glass there.
[154:05.85]Alright, I think it's time just to sit and just exist in here and then I'll have enough money tomorrow.
[154:11.73]Alright, let's do it.
[154:14.29]Just turn it on.
[154:19.59]So I should be able to buy some decent stuff tomorrow.
[154:28.08]It's in there, right?
[154:28.86]Yeah.
[154:33.26]Okay, live another day.
[154:40.96]Why are you doing Han Solo?
[154:42.12]What the hell are you guys doing?
[154:46.27]Alright.
[154:48.59]Bring it on.
[154:48.99]Let's go.
[154:49.37]I have to pee, too.
[154:55.23]I have to.
[154:55.59]I'm going to take a break after this.
[154:57.17]Go pee.
[155:06.20]And then, crap.
[155:09.08]I'm so sick of this happening.
[155:12.05]Again, we're only talking truth on this stream.
[155:14.99]Only truth.
[155:16.01]I've showed this before, but like, seriously.
[155:18.04]We're only going to speak truth.
[155:20.12]Okay?
[155:22.22]This is a razor death adder.
[155:24.60]I've used this mouse for years.
[155:27.84]I don't understand.
[155:29.66]I need to be explained as to why this... Why do you have this sticky thing over here that can come off?
[155:38.79]Do you see what's happening?
[155:40.45]That's part of the mouse.
[155:42.22]This thing is sticky.
[155:44.14]It's like glued on.
[155:46.30]And it's the grip for the mouse.
[155:50.08]Why on Earth is this possible?
[155:53.36]Because now I can't put it back on.
[156:00.54]Why is this like this?
[156:07.93]I've tried to put this back on like three or four times.
[156:11.12]You're supposed to buy a new one.
[156:13.98]This mouse is less than six months old.
[156:16.25]It's like six or seven months old.
[156:19.11]Glue it back on, but that's the problem.
[156:21.03]It's never going to fit the same way because it was like stuffed in and glued in there.
[156:25.33]I'm not sure you can see this.
[156:30.92]This thing is bigger than this slot is.
[156:33.32]It was like stuffed in and glued inside.
[156:40.11]Why is there even a grip on this mouse?
[156:42.12]What does this grip do?
[156:45.16]What's this grip, what is it here for?
[156:46.48]I need to grip my mouse?
[156:54.80]All that happens is you just get this disgusting brown shit in there.
[157:00.20]It just collects, it's a brown gamer shit collector.
[157:09.50]I don't know.
[157:10.20]I don't fucking understand.
[157:13.46]And you can't clean... I don't... Just take it off.
[157:17.54]And now I can't grab this because it's sticky.
[157:19.64]Actually, maybe that's the point.
[157:20.54]So now it's a super grip because now I stick to this when I hold it.
[157:23.73]Am I alive?
[157:24.45]I'm still fine, right?
[157:30.67]I've owned the Death Adder, different versions of it, for like 15 years.
[157:35.65]Never have I seen the glued-on weird grip thing on the edge.
[157:41.92]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[157:46.06]I'm just gonna get an Amazon- Who opened that?
[157:50.26]Did I do that?
[157:51.60]I did.
[157:52.26]Did I do that?
[158:00.83]Why did this open?
[158:06.03]Put the lamp on the door.
[158:07.11]Good call.
[158:17.38]Okay, I feel better now.
[158:27.36]I've used a generic Microsoft mouse for eight years and it's fine.
[158:32.01]Yeah.
[158:33.73]I'm just gonna get the $4 Amazon mouse.
[158:41.17]Fake gamer.
[158:41.81]I use an Amazon keyboard.
[158:43.67]That thing is fine.
[158:44.71]It was $8.95.
[158:44.95]It wasn't $300.
[158:45.29]Cheap gamer.
[159:02.98]My... Guys.
[159:05.16]We all have the same buttons.
[159:07.50]I have WASD on my keyboard.
[159:09.72]So do you.
[159:13.16]I press W and I go up.
[159:14.72]You press W, you go up too.
[159:15.87]You don't get extra keys.
[159:18.29]Maybe some of them do.
[159:25.11]All a mouse has to do is left and right click.
[159:27.47]With maybe a function button or two.
[159:29.31]Like a mini scroll wheel.
[159:35.13]You don't have any optical buttons.
[159:43.58]You don't have gamer keys.
[159:47.22]And when have you ever used your gamer keys on your special keyboard?
[159:50.66]Because every time I've had a special keyboard, they go untouched.
[159:54.46]In fact, I try to find ways to turn them off.
[159:59.24]Because I've never, I don't touch them.
[160:01.26]Dust actually collected on some of my F keys, on some of those like super function keys.
[160:05.90]Because I've never touched them.
[160:07.24]Once.
[160:12.22]It's like having the help button on your Dell keyboard.
[160:16.27]And you would accidentally press it and you'd get the help screen would come up and you'd be screaming at your monitor.
[160:29.67]I don't want help.
[160:31.71]Show us your keyboard.
[160:32.63]I've seen it before.
[160:33.27]It's an Amazon Basics.
[160:34.81]I think it was cheap.
[160:37.21]But the buttons press, and I move.
[160:41.75]Now, if I really wanted to splurge, I could go for that, like, $29.99.
[160:45.46]The one that has the thing that sticks.
[160:48.42]It lies down on two little sticks and goes up at an angle.
[161:05.87]They didn't even come near me.
[161:06.87]I'm fine.
[161:19.53]My gamer keyboard.
[161:20.79]I want to go home.
[161:23.97]Who's this?
[161:29.93]After each survived night, you gain reputation with a traitor.
[161:31.93]Alright, cool.
[161:33.79]Who is this?
[161:49.03]oops what the fuck why did you do that it's a it's a vision not even real it's just a vision alright I have 200 bucks I need to buy gasoline I'm sorry guys everyone's gonna be very upset about this but I have to I could get a metal pipe and make a gun
[162:21.26]Don't bite your lip.
[162:22.96]Omega low, omega low.
[162:24.30]Why?
[162:25.44]How much is a watch?
[162:26.48]200?
[162:26.50]300.
[162:26.74]I can't... I don't have enough.
[162:36.17]I need to live, like, another day or two.
[162:39.01]In the meantime... Um...
[162:48.60]I need a torch.
[162:49.20]I have to do one.
[162:50.28]I need a torch if I'm going to go anywhere.
[162:52.07]I already have a board with nails.
[163:01.13]Make torch and explore that wedding chapel.
[163:03.07]That's what I was thinking of doing.
[163:08.13]Sell some stuff.
[163:09.09]I feel like I need this stuff, though.
[163:12.35]Tire's not worth anything.
[163:13.49]Metal scrap I'll probably need.
[163:14.63]I'll probably need some of this at some point.
[163:18.63]At least I think I do.
[163:22.09]Sell your useless stuff.
[163:23.69]I don't know what's useless.
[163:27.29]Scrap metal.
[163:32.25]You can't go to the wedding.
[163:35.80]It's a waste of time, okay?
[163:36.82]Well, that's good to know.
[163:42.96]Hold on to my- Yeah, I'm gonna hold on to this stuff.
[163:44.50]I'm gonna go explore.
[163:45.82]The place I wanted to explore.
[163:46.70]I need healing, though.
[163:50.10]What can I get?
[163:50.58]I need two pieces of cloth.
[163:53.49]That shouldn't be that hard to find, honestly.
[163:55.21]I really do need gasoline, too.
[164:02.87]Hopefully I can find it.
[164:05.61]I can dodge by pressing control.
[164:13.36]Oh, that's really... Okay, that's good to know.
[164:16.48]General, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[164:20.85]I have like one more knight in this thing.
[164:22.52]This is going to be bad, isn't it?
[164:25.36]I'm going to go down this way.
[164:27.74]Down.
[164:29.18]Over and down.
[164:29.76]I have my torch, right?
[164:38.45]Get it on the bar.
[164:45.37]Poison.
[164:45.79]Don't touch it.
[164:48.29]Dismantle that trap.
[164:49.11]Get the scrap metal.
[164:51.45]Perfect.
[164:51.89]Okay.
[164:53.17]Down.
[164:57.91]I'm trying to find a way through here.
[165:00.19]Silent forest.
[165:04.71]There we go.
[165:05.27]Logs.
[165:06.77]Do I need these anymore, though?
[165:07.83]I feel like I don't even need these.
[165:12.59]Do I need this shit?
[165:19.01]important message uh that was very important I'm glad everybody just told me very important stuff you guys are putting in chat I appreciate it I just hit the windows button another key that should never exist anymore there's no reason for that button to exist
[165:42.44]I have this theory that Microsoft... I have this theory, right?
[165:46.64]Pause the game.
[165:47.58]I have a theory that the reason why there's a Windows key on every single keyboard is because it's just free advertisement for Windows.
[165:58.31]If it's on every single keyboard... Oh, that's the Windows key.
[166:01.69]Every single company that makes a keyboard has it there.
[166:03.91]I'm surprised it's not on Mac keyboards.
[166:07.59]Do they have to pay money to license that, by the way?
[166:10.92]If I want to make a keyboard, and I'm going to make the Jerma985 keyboard, and there's a Windows key on it, do I have to pay Microsoft like 15 cents a sale to do that?
[166:23.41]I'm actually serious.
[166:24.39]I'm actually asking this as a real question.
[166:26.01]I'm not kidding around.
[166:28.97]Yes, I do.
[166:30.23]Do I?
[166:35.87]So why do most companies put it on there?
[166:38.09]Why not just have a bigger control and a bigger alt?
[166:46.49]It's copyrighted.
[166:47.89]Who copyrighted the keyboard?
[166:52.61]That's an important function.
[166:55.43]No, it's not.
[166:57.59]There's no keyboard copyright.
[166:59.09]You don't have to pay anybody.
[167:00.09]Is there somebody that invented the keyboard, like, 40 years ago?
[167:03.71]And now you have to... Two-year Pepe dance.
[167:08.22]What?
[167:09.50]Alright, I gotta go.
[167:14.98]Silent Forest looks like it's this way, but I'm gonna move over here.
[167:20.80]This looks like the entrance to the Silent Forest.
[167:22.64]If I was an entrance to a forest, that was supposed to be the entrance to the... There it is.
[167:36.29]Alright, we got some potential room here.
[167:45.35]There's a spot over here.
[167:46.49]Window?
[167:49.42]No.
[167:49.50]There's no fucking demons here or anything.
[168:01.27]Stop singing!
[168:01.79]What are you doing?
[168:03.77]I need to... uh...
[168:11.29]Alright.
[168:16.88]Generator.
[168:17.44]Switch it on.
[168:18.26]Ooh, there's a crate.
[168:22.48]Huh?
[168:34.46]What is in there?
[168:35.40]How much gas is in this?
[168:37.68]I just wanted just for the visual.
[168:40.54]Who is saying, huh?
[168:50.37]Oh, come on.
[168:51.45]Really?
[168:51.75]Every door has a lock?
[168:59.23]What is that?
[169:03.07]Hole.
[169:17.27]This place is infected with something toxic.
[169:18.79]I need to find a way to get rid of it.
[169:26.28]Uh... I don't know.
[169:27.68]Burn?
[169:29.76]Burn it!
[169:30.06]Burn it!
[169:33.00]Molotov cocktail.
[169:35.44]Okay, I gotta get this right.
[169:36.57]I only have one.
[169:46.09]Did I do it?
[169:53.03]Okay.
[169:54.42]Um... What about over here?
[169:56.14]I... I guess I can still take this stuff.
[170:02.36]Oven.
[170:03.56]Nothing in the oven?
[170:05.73]Alright, there's somebody in here.
[170:09.75]I heard him.
[170:14.75]Oh, come on.
[170:15.29]There's another one?
[170:16.31]How do I make a Molotov cocktail?
[170:27.54]No room.
[170:30.68]Wait.
[170:38.06]Are you serious?
[170:41.00]That's annoying.
[170:42.87]okay uh further in there's a guy in here I heard him it's a bathtub what's that
[171:12.86]Egg.
[171:13.90]Something is floating inside.
[171:14.98]The skin looks to be quite thin.
[171:16.50]Maybe I could puncture it or pierce it with something.
[171:22.79]An embryo.
[171:26.25]Ah, get rid of something.
[171:27.01]Get rid of something.
[171:27.45]Get rid of something.
[171:27.87]Get rid of something.
[171:29.23]What do I get rid of?
[171:29.71]I don't know what to get rid of.
[171:37.00]I can't make the... Stone?
[171:39.00]Stone?
[171:42.02]And I'm gonna make a bandage.
[171:46.67]You fucking idiot.
[171:48.01]You imbecile.
[171:49.63]Two bandages.
[171:51.99]Uh, no.
[171:52.85]Um... The rag?
[172:02.26]The meat.
[172:02.98]Give me that egg.
[172:12.26]I got it, okay.
[172:13.32]What... Bathtub.
[172:19.30]Search bathtub.
[172:20.84]Alright, I'm getting into uncharted territory here.
[172:22.80]There's somebody... I heard the noise of somebody gurgling and stuff.
[172:27.62]Nothing else over here.
[172:33.51]Don't die in here.
[172:34.51]Who's gonna be in this bedroom?
[172:56.98]Why is it so dark over here?
[172:59.44]What's that?
[173:01.04]There's a guy.
[173:01.56]Yeah, there's somebody right there.
[173:02.36]The person who killed him?
[173:37.14]I just, like, had to press the number one and I just panicked to a point where I got hit three times.
[173:43.62]Oh, god damn it.
[173:48.08]I didn't even know what it was gonna- I thought it was gonna be just a regular person.
[173:50.67]It was one of those guys with the giant spear halberds.
[173:56.69]And you have to hit them, like, seven times for them to die.
[174:00.87]I tried to press one, but I pressed the tilde key, which, by the way, why is that on a keyboard?
[174:05.76]I'm gonna make a new- I'm gonna make a keyboard where all this useless shit is not on here.
[174:10.58]You know what I'm saying?
[174:13.35]I'm getting rid of the tilde key.
[174:14.83]I'm getting rid of the Windows key.
[174:16.61]I'm getting rid of whatever this is.
[174:19.83]What is this?
[174:21.15]What is this like filing cabinet down here?
[174:23.77]Do you see this?
[174:25.69]What's the filing cabinet button next to the Alt key?
[174:28.85]What is that?
[174:30.11]What is this?
[174:31.45]What's that for?
[174:35.71]Page up, page down, you're out.
[174:37.72]Scroll, lock, pause, break.
[174:39.36]The music button.
[174:41.56]They're all gone.
[174:42.34]All of them.
[174:45.76]There's a music button on here.
[174:52.54]I want a minimal keyboard with just the shit that you know you use.
[174:56.45]Why does it exist?
[175:00.51]The filing cabinet button opens the right click menu.
[175:05.18]Why do I have a mouse?
[175:06.18]I want it to right-click menu!
[175:22.78]Tiny- it's gonna be a tiny little keyboard.
[175:25.59]No, it'll just be all the QWERTY, all the numbers, all the function keys are gone, by the way.
[175:34.17]No Windows key.
[175:35.99]Tab can stay because it's useful.
[175:37.45]Caps Lock can stay.
[175:39.34]All this, like, Home, End, Insert... I just need one.
[175:43.54]The Delete key can be this big and sit right there.
[175:49.91]And you know what else I don't like?
[175:51.33]The Fn key is like a double function key.
[175:53.89]Nobody uses that many keys.
[175:58.74]I can't think of any person I've ever come across, hold on, I'm burning daylight here.
[176:03.17]I can't think of one person I've ever come across in my entire life, and I mean my whole life, that has ever pressed the FN and a function key.
[176:10.97]In my entire life.
[176:12.45]Even IT people.
[176:17.15]FN function, for what?
[176:18.07]What do you use it for?
[176:20.57]What's it for?
[176:23.47]I want to see at least two or three different scenarios where it's useful.
[176:29.54]For your volume.
[176:30.24]So you need 24 function keys to raise and lower the volume of your computer.
[176:47.92]I can understand- Alright.
[176:49.74]If the tail of the key doesn't exist, that guy's dead.
[176:52.34]And now I lost the- the fucking- I lost the egg.
[176:55.29]No, I didn't.
[176:56.09]Game's actually pretty fun.
[176:58.03]Never mind.
[176:58.41]I was- I- That whole- Pretend that whole thing didn't happen.
[177:03.49]Fn is for music control.
[177:06.13]Just turn on the radio!
[177:10.05]And- Alright, anyways.
[177:17.61]They've been making keyboards the same fucking way since like 1994.
[177:24.56]And nobody's decided to... The machines in the factory are set up to always do it like this.
[177:29.84]So they're just like, I don't want to change that.
[177:33.38]I don't want to get rid of that.
[177:34.24]It's important for no one.
[177:36.24]It's for grandma to accidentally press and like turn her brightness up.
[177:43.11]Alright.
[177:43.61]I'm done with that.
[177:44.29]A little bit of an angry.
[177:45.77]I'm supposed to pee.
[177:50.43]brightness.
[177:50.91]No, if your screen's too bright, just go to the power options and just drag the bar.
[177:56.27]I'm making a keyboard and I'm gonna make trillion dollars.
[177:58.29]It's gonna be the trillion dollar keyboard.
[178:00.62]Alright, I'll be right back.
[178:02.52]I gotta piss.
[182:00.43]seriously possibly imagine if you were playing like God of War 2 on your Xbox and you accidentally press the filing cabinet button what's his image what are you linking like a skeleton
[182:29.19]Okay, if you pause at three seconds, I look like a skeleton.
[182:37.45]I'm talking about the video, not the stream.
[182:46.62]The video that just got linked.
[182:49.16]Alright, I'm ready.
[182:50.87]I'm ready.
[182:51.57]Ugh, I hate losing.
[182:54.67]What a super villain thing to say.
[182:56.17]I hate to lose.
[182:57.39]Okay.
[183:04.94]Do the thing where some- the cartoon where somebody pulls your tongue out high- far and lets it go?
[183:09.24]Wait, what are you talking about?
[183:11.64]I don't even know what that means.
[183:13.84]Alright, let's go.
[183:14.44]Okay.
[183:21.43]What was I doing?
[183:22.31]I had this egg.
[183:26.16]I'm going to store the egg.
[183:27.00]I don't know what it's for.
[183:27.98]I'm going to store this.
[183:30.73]Store this.
[183:31.61]All of it, I guess.
[183:33.83]If I killed that thing, it would have been good.
[183:36.31]I need lost inventory.
[183:39.23]Wait, I can go get my inventory?
[183:42.86]What was that?
[183:44.84]Show it to him.
[183:45.60]What do you mean?
[183:46.28]What do you got?
[183:47.96]Something here?
[184:00.21]What I I saw that yeah, I saw I saw it.
[184:03.33]Yeah, it's me being funny That's me doing that on purpose I was doing like a funny face, you know, I want like Alright, somebody said cook egg are you for real does that work should I cook egg
[184:30.07]Draw my perfect keyboard.
[184:31.40]No, I can't.
[184:37.34]Oh, that's right, I can cook an egg.
[184:41.19]Oh, 40 essence?
[184:44.31]Nice.
[184:44.59]Okay.
[184:47.65]That's worth a lot.
[184:52.58]Now...
[184:57.28]This is a hard game.
[184:58.77]This is a very hard game.
[184:59.61]It takes a lot of patience.
[185:00.53]Imagine playing this game on Nightmare or whatever the hell it is.
[185:02.61]It's going to rain again.
[185:09.44]Should have hatched it.
[185:14.36]Can you do that?
[185:15.26]That's weird.
[185:16.68]I'm going to go... Where am I going to go?
[185:22.25]I've been here.
[185:23.01]This is Wolf's camp.
[185:24.05]I can go up too, but I'm not good enough to go up yet.
[185:28.70]I need a... I need to not panic when I see... I feel the same way when I ever came across the butcher in Diablo 1.
[185:37.46]I had the same reaction.
[185:38.68]Same exact perspective.
[185:40.26]Same exact scenario.
[185:41.30]He was around a corner.
[185:43.46]And he was just... It was terrifying.
[185:45.46]I couldn't do it.
[185:46.04]It was scary because he couldn't see.
[185:47.36]Alright.
[185:51.69]Um...
[185:54.79]I don't know what exact time it is.
[185:58.67]And I don't have any gasoline.
[186:00.31]This is the last day that I can do this without needing to forcibly... I need to get gasoline.
[186:04.89]This is the last night I can do this.
[186:09.50]Should I try to go get my inventory?
[186:10.56]I think I'm going to try to get it.
[186:19.88]I know that guy's in there.
[186:21.08]I just have to dodge and hit him.
[186:22.23]I'm going for it.
[186:37.88]Is my hand slippery and fucking in rain?
[186:41.24]What is going on?
[186:42.08]Ugh.
[187:02.41]Now, instead of being, go find logs for an hour.
[187:05.59]Now go find rags for an hour.
[187:07.98]At least there are plenty of those, that's true.
[187:26.69]That is correct, you're right.
[187:29.25]Although this thing's almost broken, and it's...
[187:32.93]I need that watch.
[187:33.65]I would literally sell everything in my inventory tomorrow to get that watch.
[187:39.96]I hate not knowing how much time I have.
[187:41.36]It's killing me.
[187:43.96]I need to repair this weapon.
[187:48.36]Don't step on that glass.
[188:04.00]Alright, prepare.
[188:07.11]Just do it.
[188:09.99]I need another torch.
[188:16.62]I wish there was a mode in this game where there was just a big box that had ten of every single one of these in them.
[188:23.06]Just to get you going.
[188:30.92]It's getting late, yeah.
[188:32.70]But I can't turn the thing on yet.
[188:43.76]Right when I feel like I'm getting going, I have to hide in this house and be terrified.
[188:52.09]I guess that's the point, right?
[188:58.99]I need... I'm gonna make like four torches, or five torches or something.
[189:04.83]I need alcohol, matches, planks, and rags.
[189:16.39]Is this gonna be enough if I turn it on now?
[189:20.23]I see a booger.
[189:21.31]No you don't.
[189:28.95]I hope this is enough otherwise I'm dead where what what are you talking about stop alright pray that this is enough because then I'll have enough money to hopefully buy some stuff
[189:56.68]This is why I can't have face cam.
[189:57.83]I've told you this a thousand times.
[190:04.77]B-Omega-1 Booger.
[190:06.51]There's a booger on the door behind you.
[190:15.60]Imagine if I moved out of the way and there was just this six or seven month long booger wall.
[190:24.46]When I was...
[190:29.39]It's nighttime, so we have to talk about some of these things.
[190:32.51]When I was like... Maybe seven or eight years old.
[190:42.29]In my bedroom.
[190:45.45]You know what's coming.
[190:51.88]The wall next to my bedroom.
[190:54.96]Because my bed was right up against the wall.
[190:59.34]Right up against the wall.
[191:11.01]When I was eight, maybe like seven or eight years old, every single night, it would go, and I thought I was being so sneaky.
[191:31.98]We know what it is.
[191:32.82]I'm not going to say it.
[191:33.48]I don't need to.
[191:34.78]But there would be a collection.
[191:37.22]Hidden.
[191:39.70]And anytime we would rearrange the room.
[191:43.66]If my mother wanted to rearrange the beds.
[191:46.54]Or hey, we're going to change this.
[191:47.64]We're going to change some stuff.
[191:52.69]What is this?
[191:53.85]That was like seven.
[192:04.65]I was a literal child, okay?
[192:08.55]This didn't happen two weeks ago.
[192:21.00]Seven's too old?
[192:26.50]To be
[192:30.68]You puked in your mom's bed two weeks ago.
[192:32.48]More like, nine years ago.
[192:36.56]I threw up in my ba- yeah, but that was, like, that was a- these things are like a decade old.
[192:41.39]More than that.
[192:44.95]That was ten years ago.
[192:48.31]You were 25.
[192:48.61]Yeah, I had to fuck- I puke, I had to throw up.
[192:57.10]I was sick.
[192:57.86]I didn't feel well.
[192:58.68]What, you've never thrown up before?
[193:00.76]Unexpectedly?

[199:14.46]Okay.
[199:15.78]I've got my watch.
[199:16.66]I've got my board.
[199:17.66]I'm going down here to get my inventory.
[199:21.66]It's just one person down there.
[199:23.30]I've got my watch.
[199:24.04]I'm ready to go.
[199:24.66]Let's go.
[199:27.67]Good luck for your law degree.
[199:31.31]Thanks.
[199:32.83]I'm trying.

[199:44.92]I need to find mushrooms, too.
[199:46.24]Okay, perfect.
[199:49.10]I need to just kill the dude that's in here.
[199:53.17]I don't want to take any unnecessary stuff from my inventory.
[199:58.66]So, essentially, it's one minute a second, kind of.
[200:01.42]Sort of.
[200:03.32]Alright, here we go, into the woods.
[200:06.26]Is that guy just out of the house now?
[200:08.14]Or is he gonna be standing somewhere in particular?
[200:10.36]This is gonna- Okay, don't panic.
[200:14.56]Don't accidentally press one of the 17 useless keys on the keyboard that you have.
[200:21.93]He's gonna be right here somewhere.
[200:32.89]how did I get down there before how did I get down there before for the other side okay
[201:03.90]What's that?
[201:05.74]What is that?
[201:06.04]Is it a bug?
[201:06.62]What's that?
[201:09.68]Dead bug.
[201:12.10]Bug.
[201:13.22]Shell.
[201:14.20]Where the hell is he?
[201:24.01]Fucking butcher.
[201:28.53]Hold on.
[201:28.83]There's no gas in here.
[202:16.91]You motherfucker, where are you?
[202:24.89]Okay, alright, come on out, come on.
[202:27.61]Come on.
[202:31.11]Come on, come on, come on.
[202:33.75]Come on out.
[202:42.52]One, two, three, go!
[203:14.78]That's it, right?
[203:15.26]Nobody else?
[203:20.46]Okay, alcohol.
[203:22.02]Note.
[203:23.33]The door code is 3333.
[203:25.57]It can't get any easier.
[203:26.49]Remember it.
[203:27.03]I'm not opening that door after dark anymore.
[203:29.47]I went to get some gasoline from the pig shed.
[203:31.91]I'll be back after dark.
[203:34.59]Gas from the pig shed.
[203:44.86]What is that?
[203:45.46]Shiny stone.
[203:50.97]That's worth 130 bucks.
[203:51.57]Alright, I need to use bandage.
[204:01.99]Is my inventory down here somewhere?
[204:04.57]Where's my inventory?
[204:09.07]Where is it?
[204:09.57]Is it not here?
[204:12.13]Corpse.
[204:13.07]Chair.
[204:16.95]Wardrobe.
[204:18.55]Take all that stuff.
[204:26.35]Lamp?
[204:28.85]Oh, backpack.
[204:29.61]Alright, I'm leaving.
[204:33.29]I know the code and I know that there's gasoline in the pig shed.
[204:37.19]I'm out.
[204:38.45]What time is it?
[204:39.25]11.
[204:39.27]That's enough time to get out of here.
[204:48.65]I have code to... Alright, get me out.
[204:53.13]I'm panicking right now.
[204:54.41]I'm just so fucking nervous.
[205:02.55]What's that noise?
[205:03.13]Why is there a noise?
[205:07.40]The thing's about to be out.
[205:14.58]Three, three, three, three.
[205:41.17]Sleeper!
[205:41.91]Sleeper!
[205:42.74]Who's sleeping?
[205:44.20]Shotgun!
[205:44.70]And a map of the forest!
[205:47.19]Is this guy sleeping?
[205:48.57]What do I do?
[205:48.91]Should I kill him?
[205:57.20]He's going to get up and he's going to attack me.
[205:58.98]Right?
[206:00.92]I have to leap.
[206:01.90]Hey there, friend.
[206:02.64]Hey there.
[206:03.00]Hi, hi, hi, hi.
[206:03.64]Yes.
[206:05.89]In the last hideout... Look for an exit beneath the floor.
[206:32.08]He's gonna... He was a friend.
[206:33.86]He's gonna get up and run... Just like that.
[206:37.20]Like I told you.
[206:37.72]He called you a friend.
[206:44.89]That doesn't matter.
[206:45.89]I have to leave now.
[206:47.99]I'm not going this way.
[206:51.23]Anybody that's alive is going to stand up and sprint at you.
[206:55.35]That's how these games work.
[206:56.57]I can't let that happen.
[206:58.19]Not with this much stuff in my inventory.
[207:01.83]And no torches, by the way.
[207:03.09]Okay, I have to leave now.
[207:11.13]I have to leave right now.
[207:13.04]Get out of here now.
[207:15.08]Please get me out.
[207:16.28]I don't know how to get out of here.
[207:29.15]I'm sorry, if an NPC has a dialog option that's like trade, gossip, talk, we're good.
[207:37.54]If you're rolling around on the ground, and I don't know who you are, and there is no dialog options...
[207:53.34]Can you use a friend?
[207:54.26]There are no such thing as friends.
[207:57.32]Not in a post-apocalyptic world.
[208:02.48]I made it, though.
[208:03.84]And I have enough gasoline.
[208:04.68]Alright, I can't look at chat anymore, sorry.
[208:10.73]No more chatting.
[208:17.05]I had so... Why is he doing that?
[208:30.08]Alright, I'm here.
[208:42.33]No, now I'm in the wrong spot.
[208:45.39]So 3-3, that's how you get down here.
[208:49.25]And then this is the silent forest hideout.
[208:52.78]I'm assuming I eventually have to end up up here somewhere.
[208:55.90]Here we go.
[208:56.74]Let's fill this up.
[209:01.08]With the gas that we have now.
[209:04.10]Which I should have.
[209:04.90]I got plenty.
[209:06.83]What is this?
[209:07.09]A piece of wood?
[209:07.89]A staff made of wooden unknown origin.
[209:10.95]And I have shotgun shells too.
[209:12.13]This is pretty good.
[209:12.97]Okay.
[209:13.79]Let's fill this up.
[209:27.16]Not bad.
[209:29.92]Now, this is a weapon?
[209:32.04]Let me go back.
[209:32.50]Let me go to my weapon crafting bench.
[209:37.33]See if I have anything new to do.
[209:42.90]Upgrade workshop.
[209:46.84]I need, I don't know, is it a toolbox?
[209:54.13]Shell.
[209:55.93]Rag.
[209:56.47]Okay, let me make some more.
[209:58.01]Shiny stone.
[209:58.80]That's worth a lot.
[210:02.00]Alright, let's take out the bandages.
[210:03.20]I have three bandages.
[210:09.56]An image link is here.
[210:10.87]It's alright.
[210:13.45]Torch.
[210:14.33]I can make one.
[210:15.63]So, make one.
[210:17.05]I need board.
[210:20.37]I can...
[210:23.69]Alright.
[210:25.43]I can make three torches.
[210:26.39]I need to just turn on the thing out here.
[210:28.53]Let's do that.
[210:29.53]Is there a bear or something?
[210:36.28]What was that?
[210:39.00]25 fuel.
[210:39.60]Shit.
[210:43.84]Shouldn't have used it all, huh?
[210:48.48]What happened to my watch?
[210:50.91]Oh.
[210:51.63]It's in the workshop.
[210:55.72]Never take that watch off.
[210:57.30]Ever.
[211:00.22]That's fine.
[211:02.32]Alcohol.
[211:03.10]I have three bandages.
[211:05.18]One torch.
[211:15.24]What?
[211:17.62]Bored with nails.
[211:18.34]Upgrades.
[211:18.94]Hardened?
[211:19.88]More nails and light?
[211:22.42]Inflects more...
[211:29.67]yeah let's alright repair it uh I need boards and uh oh should I have done that bugger eating stance
[211:51.61]Everyone's focusing on boogers and pee.
[211:54.71]That sounds about right.
[211:55.61]I need more fuel.
[211:58.55]Which means I have to live tonight and then buy fuel tomorrow.
[212:02.32]Yeah.
[212:02.88]That's the play.
[212:04.80]I got enough.
[212:05.80]Let me see if... Let me just block some doors here.
[212:08.54]I didn't have supplies!
[212:13.44]Right there.
[212:19.63]I actually think I want to bring this into the other room.
[212:28.81]That was a nice reference.
[212:29.87]Somebody else said it, not me.
[212:34.47]These are all still good.
[212:35.45]I can't cook anything.
[212:40.00]Efficiency.
[212:40.70]Oven efficiency 1.
[212:41.36]How do I make my oven better?
[212:42.68]Okay, this is still good.
[212:49.17]All this is still fine.
[212:58.17]The other hideouts.
[212:59.25]Oh, okay.
[213:02.01]I see.
[213:03.63]I feel you.
[213:05.84]Alright, so we gotta get ready.
[213:06.82]I'm gonna pull this back.
[213:14.88]What do I think about the game so far?
[213:17.13]The visibility thing seems frustrating, but cool.
[213:20.15]Oh, I think it's... I think it's good.
[213:24.25]I think I'm slowly starting to understand what I'm even supposed to be doing.
[213:28.05]But, uh... I think it's good.
[213:30.83]I think it's fun.
[213:36.69]He hates it.
[213:38.17]Well, I mean, I'll probably uninstall it after this stream today, but... I'm kidding!
[213:46.80]It's a joke.
[213:48.88]Alright.
[213:50.32]At least you're honest.
[213:53.75]We'll see how far I get.
[213:57.71]Torch.
[213:58.69]Three bandages.
[213:59.34]I need to repair this before it becomes too late.
[214:04.08]Although, while there's still some time left, I'm gonna go see if I can find some more nails.
[214:10.78]Where have I not gone?
[214:11.74]I haven't gone, like, over here.
[214:12.74]I'm just gonna check it out really quick.
[214:21.47]Is it a survival game?
[214:22.79]Yeah, kind of.
[214:24.77]It's a top-down... It's a top-down, horror, survival-esque game.
[214:45.53]So yeah, it is.
[214:47.13]Okay.
[214:47.91]Dry meadow.
[214:48.63]I'm up here now.
[214:51.61]Somewhere around 19 or so I gotta turn around.
[214:55.43]There's nothing over here.
[214:56.29]No, like, random logs or anything.
[215:07.26]Oh, if you have any of the horror games that I have not played... On stream at least, or in a while... Toss them in the recommended for the Discord, because...
[215:20.33]I would play a bunch of horror games this month, because obviously it makes sense, right?
[215:24.61]This is not... I'm not going to find anything over here.
[215:32.19]No, it's not worth it.
[215:33.59]I just need to live one more day.
[215:34.47]Yeah, it's not worth it.
[215:43.14]Let's get me out of here.
[215:45.14]Do PT?
[215:46.84]Didn't I do PT on stream?
[215:56.32]I don't even remember.
[215:58.86]I know I played PT, but did I play it on stream?
[216:01.72]I don't know.
[216:04.00]Probably not.
[216:05.30]Alright, I have to get the hell out of here.
[216:06.82]I must return to my hideout before night.
[216:08.20]I know, that's what I'm doing.
[216:09.06]Let's hide.
[216:20.81]So, it was a good game.
[216:26.03]I have heard it's a good game.
[216:28.66]How long is Selma?
[216:35.58]Move the bookcase.
[216:37.08]Like eight hours?
[216:51.57]That's not bad.
[216:57.66]Alright, that's good.
[217:00.75]Check the door.
[217:01.37]Doors are okay.
[217:02.71]Good, good, good, good, good.
[217:03.69]Alright, close this one.
[217:05.88]Lock it up.
[217:17.05]It's like two to three average Jerma streams for one playthrough of SOMO.
[217:20.79]Are we saying that I'm not going to be capable of beating it in like eight hours?
[217:25.09]You think it's going to take me like 20 plus hours to beat it?
[217:29.21]What did you say?
[217:32.44]It's going to take me 20 hours to beat that game.
[217:38.02]Is that some kind of challenge?
[217:39.54]It's around 16 hours.
[217:40.82]Well, that's double what the last person said.
[217:45.32]Penumbra would be good too.
[217:51.65]We'll check them out.
[217:53.05]Alright, I gotta pay attention because this is an important day.
[217:55.45]Because then after this, we're going down to the Silent Forest hideout.
[218:05.82]Every time I talk about something random during this, nothing happens.
[218:11.28]I need another topic to go off on.
[218:17.88]Oh, my stream title is terrible.
[218:23.11]That's really bad.
[218:25.51]When your stream title is the name of the game category, and there's no difference, when somebody's browsing through Twitch, it just says Darkwood Darkwood.
[218:33.13]And they think that there's something wrong with their browser, and then they don't come to the stream.
[218:42.02]I should put Darkwood, I should put this in brackets.
[218:46.00]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[218:47.56]So it's like, the title is Darkwood brackets 1.
[218:53.78]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[219:08.19]OK, it's fixed.
[219:13.43]So now if you go out to the Twitch browser,
[219:19.95]It'll say, like, Darkwood, Darkwood 1, and you'll... Wait, wait, wait, they named it twice, but that's weird.
[219:25.70]Eh.
[219:26.66]Looks a bit weird.
[219:31.98]Don't refresh.
[219:35.24]Well, I wouldn't refresh, because you'll get an ad.
[219:38.21]Somebody here.
[219:40.25]How are they in here?
[219:40.85]Are they in here?
[219:41.31]They're just fighting the dogs outside.
[219:52.98]That was really close.
[219:53.93]That was right outside the door.
[219:54.93]He's not gonna, like, shoot a gun in here, right?
[219:58.41]They don't... sophisticate.
[220:00.21]Do they?
[220:20.82]I'm gonna assume morning is like 5.
[220:22.12]Like 5.30.
[220:37.05]Are they people or are they zombies?
[220:39.05]I really don't know.
[220:43.56]I think they're infected people.
[220:50.22]Can you sleep?
[220:51.32]You cannot sleep.
[220:53.74]You have to just weather the storm.
[221:06.39]They can't get in.
[221:07.17]This is a good strategy.
[221:07.85]I like this.
[221:10.65]Two lamps in front of the door, both barricaded.
[221:15.75]Do I think that hot lava is worth buying?
[221:17.19]Um...
[221:19.53]It depends on how much you'd like to jump.
[221:21.59]And grab stuff.
[221:32.28]Who did it?
[221:35.12]Answer it.
[221:39.88]Did we get him?
[221:40.33]Did we get the streamer?
[221:43.75]Close the fucking door.
[221:50.02]He's throwing... Oh, no, don't die in here.
[221:56.70]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, please.
[222:15.39]Why did you open it?
[222:16.29]I was closing it.
[222:22.18]Oh, no.
[222:22.80]How did he get in?
[222:23.40]Did he actually get in?
[222:24.66]He got in.
[222:25.22]And it's one of these guys.
[222:25.94]I'm dead.
[222:27.28]I'm dead.
[222:27.95]I'm blocked.
[222:28.59]I'm dead.
[222:29.35]I'm dead.
[222:30.43]I'm dead.
[222:31.13]I'm dead here.
[222:32.21]Just don't.
[222:32.65]What do I do?
[222:43.95]Come on, Foxy's right in front of me.
[222:46.03]Ducky's to my right.
[222:48.33]I can hear Freddy.
[222:49.47]I can hear him through this ear.
[222:53.19]Made it.
[222:58.67]I need to do something about that.
[223:11.76]I can't continue like that.
[223:15.72]Gasoline is the easy answer to be able to get planks.
[223:21.37]I'm gonna bring the dresser.
[223:22.21]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[223:24.61]Weapon parts.
[223:25.75]I have something for you, actually.
[223:29.09]I have something for you.
[223:31.33]Should I sell the jewel?
[223:32.35]Whatever it is?
[223:35.05]Because I have some stuff that's worth some money.
[223:38.89]I got... Pills.
[223:41.77]I got these shells.
[223:44.59]It's worth 130 bucks.
[223:45.03]Shiny stone...
[223:49.78]I don't think I'm ever gonna have a shotgun.
[223:51.88]At least not now.
[224:06.25]I'm just gonna do it.
[224:07.03]Whatever.
[224:07.47]If it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea.
[224:09.53]It's okay, though.
[224:13.72]I need stuff now, not stuff later.
[224:22.78]200.
[224:22.84]I'll have a lot.
[224:27.20]Which then can get me... The fabric.
[224:33.26]I need this.
[224:34.08]I also need gas, too, though.
[224:43.03]Handgun, bolt handle, long barrel...
[224:47.08]What about the axe, blade, shovel?
[225:01.48]There's too many things to do.
[225:02.60]I don't know.
[225:14.42]There's too many... I don't know.
[225:16.16]I don't know.
[225:20.53]wire it's done whatever it is it's done gasoline too fuck it like I need it okay front door front door front door hold on hold on hold on oh wait wait wait wait wait
[225:59.20]Alright, the front door.

[226:04.14]Alright, now I need to fill this up a little bit.
[226:16.89]Okay.
[226:18.99]Turn this generator off.
[226:22.17]Sour Jupiter, really.
[226:23.27]Nice job.
[226:37.19]Alright, now I can make... What the hell happened?
[226:42.80]Lockpick.
[226:46.72]At least I have a lockpick now.
[226:51.71]I need to repair this, which means I have to go... Wait, did I turn it off?
[226:55.65]I did, right?
[227:00.71]Yeah.
[227:05.95]Why do I have loud pee?
[227:07.07]That's an old reference that I have not seen in a very long time.
[227:10.98]It's been a while.
[227:13.14]Alright.
[227:13.84]Planks.
[227:14.74]Need them.
[227:15.38]Planks.
[227:16.10]Need them.
[227:16.72]Planks.
[227:17.64]Need them.
[227:21.26]Plenty now.
[227:23.00]Repair this.
[227:24.32]It now does more damage, which is good.
[227:26.68]And then I need to move some stuff.
[227:30.87]Oh, shit.
[227:34.39]I need nails.
[227:42.83]Huh?
[227:51.86]What was that?
[227:55.06]You guys heard that, right?
[227:59.76]Alright, can I buy nails?
[228:02.08]I can.
[228:05.81]Just give me ten.
[228:11.36]I heard that.
[228:11.96]Somebody was walking around.
[228:12.82]There we go.
[228:20.08]Alright, now this thing is good.
[228:22.62]How many torches do I have?
[228:25.28]Zero.
[228:27.49]I want at least two.
[228:31.99]Seems good to me.
[228:37.09]I need whatever that is.
[228:42.99]I am going to board this shut.
[228:46.28]Because what's the point of leaving out this front door?
[228:49.02]There is none.
[228:50.58]I always go out the back door anyways.
[228:51.96]I need more nails.
[228:54.08]I need two more nails.
[229:05.11]Wait.
[229:06.05]Don't do that?
[229:07.43]Why not?
[229:11.18]No, I'm doing it.
[229:12.06]That's how they keep getting in.
[229:12.88]Do you remember, you answer the door when it knocks at night.
[229:22.73]Should I really be doing that?
[229:26.29]Um, okay.
[229:30.02]Give me the other gasoline.
[229:31.00]I'll take it.
[229:31.66]Alright, I'm done.
[229:46.11]Lockpick.
[229:48.09]Get rid of the boards.
[229:49.31]Keep two torches.
[229:51.17]One in the... Here.
[229:53.51]Get rid of the bottle.
[229:54.27]Get rid of the stone.
[229:55.43]Keep the bandages.
[229:56.25]Keep the lockpick.
[229:58.35]It's time to explore.
[229:59.57]I'm ready.
[230:00.65]I'm going for it.
[230:02.33]I've got a good weapon now.
[230:04.09]I'm going.
[230:04.69]I don't know.
[230:08.41]Burn down house.
[230:11.85]Or the... Hmm.
[230:13.16]I mean, this is where I need to go.
[230:16.78]I can go up.
[230:17.34]Okay, I'm gonna go up.
[230:19.34]Up.
[230:22.66]I have heals, right?
[230:25.86]I have three bandages.
[230:26.92]Okay.
[230:34.02]Let's go.
[230:38.55]I'm gonna go straight up into the air.
[230:55.08]Go that way.
[231:05.19]Ah, this is a high level zone.
[231:08.40]I went to the high level zone.
[231:25.93]Where you going?
[231:26.37]Where you going?
[231:28.25]Where's he going?
[231:29.12]Why'd he do that?
[231:39.16]I got a shiny stone.
[231:39.90]I got it.
[231:52.45]Why is there a rooster?
[232:27.03]Alright.
[232:31.13]Why did they run away?
[232:32.43]Is this dog dead?
[232:36.55]This dog doesn't look dead.
[232:39.71]Where am I?
[232:44.37]Where the hell am I?
[232:44.91]Oh, this is the burnt house.
[232:52.31]I can do this now.
[233:11.92]I can do this shit now.
[233:13.38]Alright, stuff.
[233:20.73]Stuff, anything.
[233:21.83]Search the sack.
[233:22.59]Alcohol.
[233:24.73]Bed and nobody in the bed.
[233:27.58]Wardrobe.
[233:28.52]Ooh, there's a flare in here and there's pills in here too.
[233:35.30]A note from the burnt house.
[233:38.03]I know they're there.
[233:39.89]I can hear them laughing.
[233:40.91]They're behind the wall of trees.
[233:42.73]I can't get through by myself.
[233:44.09]The trees grow back too fast.
[233:49.11]Double mushroom.
[233:50.99]Oh, this is perfect.
[234:05.33]Mushrooms.
[234:09.40]Just behind the trees.
[234:11.11]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[234:15.73]Sofa.
[234:17.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[234:19.97]Yeah.
[234:22.34]Yep.
[234:23.84]Yep, yep.
[234:24.84]Yep, alright.
[235:03.38]I might be a little up.
[235:08.01]I'm pretty close to leveling up, I think.
[235:10.53]Without a doubt.
[235:11.19]Alright, easy.
[235:13.50]Come on over here.
[235:14.36]There's a red log.
[235:17.68]Come here.
[235:29.65]What's a red log?
[235:30.67]There's a pig, right?
[235:31.53]The pig, the pig door?
[235:32.84]The pig door, right?
[235:33.62]Something was just on my leg.
[235:35.04]I'm not kidding.
[235:38.78]What was it?
[235:45.12]I don't know.
[235:47.60]I felt something, I promise.
[236:00.93]Didn't the guy say that there was a pig?
[236:05.00]Red seesaw.
[236:10.48]What's the significance of the red seesaw?
[236:16.91]I have a lot of mushrooms now.
[236:25.93]Nothing in here?
[236:26.45]What?
[236:34.90]I swear there was a peg door.
[236:39.26]No.
[236:39.50]Alright.
[236:39.66]Well, I got the burnt down house now.
[236:48.51]Check the sofa.
[236:49.45]LOL.
[236:51.05]Sofa.
[236:51.73]LOL.
[236:51.93]Alright.
[236:54.13]Okay.
[236:56.43]Okay.
[237:11.12]White dress.
[237:13.43]A white child-sized press.
[237:17.91]And the thing that's $450.
[237:20.09]Do not die.
[237:23.19]Get this back so I can... That's a lot of money.
[237:45.22]I see you right there.
[237:46.10]Alright, I'm up.
[238:00.52]Why am I... People are asking why I'm killing the dogs.
[238:04.74]Because they're trying to kill me and I'm just trying to live.
[238:09.12]I've got a $450 piece of fabric in my back.
[238:13.97]I am not going to lose that one.
[238:21.37]Bingo.
[238:22.09]Nice.
[238:23.27]Alright.
[238:25.49]Every time, I swear.
[238:28.71]Hot bar upgrade.
[238:31.71]Inventory upgrade.
[239:00.35]OK, I wanted the slots.
[239:04.32]There's only two slots.
[239:11.34]Antidote?
[239:12.88]No, no, I want to level up.
[239:20.62]Speaking of that.
[239:29.24]120 out of 150.
[239:29.68]I need three more mushrooms and I get to level up.
[239:35.47]Almost new powers.
[239:36.29]Yeah, I just need three more mushrooms.
[239:39.77]Oh, that's cool.
[239:40.45]Alright, nice.
[239:41.31]So the burned house is pretty much completed.
[239:43.97]The wedding, though, I don't have the key code to get in.
[239:48.11]I should be making some traps.
[239:50.09]Alright, so let's go with chain trap.
[239:54.25]And then I'm going to go with bear trap.
[239:56.61]And then I'm going to go with chain trap again.
[240:00.57]Bear trap.
[240:03.37]Now let's take a look.
[240:04.24]Repair item.
[240:05.82]Get that completed.
[240:06.76]I still have a lot of time, so I'm not going to do this yet.
[240:11.00]I have a lot of just junk in my inventory.
[240:15.15]Okay.
[240:22.50]I can do this again?
[240:23.26]No, only once.
[240:24.89]I'm going to take this time here to try and find a chest to open, which I think there was a couple over here.
[240:36.59]Still about four hours or so.
[240:46.26]There was a chest over here somewhere.
[240:48.88]Legitimately right here.
[240:55.01]Pretty good.
[240:58.85]Yeah, I think that deserves a few PepoDances.
[241:02.82]Nothing else?
[241:07.22]Oh.
[241:10.78]I got a couple of these now.
[241:12.69]I'm gonna be making some money now.
[241:18.65]Dog.
[241:21.75]Excuse me?
[241:30.71]By the way, you can always tell when I look at chat when I go like this.
[241:32.52]Because you guys are right there.
[241:35.06]Alright.
[241:47.65]Now this is the underground passage place, which I can't do anything here.
[241:51.61]This is the endgame.
[241:54.21]That's how you leave.
[241:54.87]That's how you win.
[242:01.65]I'm trying to find mushrooms, though, in the few hours I have.
[242:13.14]Win, win, win, win, win.
[242:14.04]I can't win.
[242:15.34]Not yet.
[242:15.74]I'm going back down towards Wedding, but I need to find a couple more mushrooms.
[242:21.97]I've already done this.
[242:31.19]Anime is lame.
[242:32.69]Why are you saying that?
[242:39.33]Where did that come from?
[243:06.57]Wire.
[243:07.46]Alcohol.
[243:08.44]Magazine.
[243:12.80]What is this?
[243:15.57]Is it GQ or Better Homes and Gardens?
[243:40.85]Just farming those minus twos, don't mind me.
[243:53.33]-2 for every dog that you kill.
[243:55.37]It's not fair.
[244:20.85]I can't.
[244:21.23]It's too far away.
[244:22.19]Alright, I gotta get back.
[244:25.41]My face cam's too dark.
[244:27.21]Oh.
[244:27.83]I'll fix it later.
[244:30.53]Where the hell am I?
[244:33.72]Ooh, wait a minute.
[244:35.26]Is this back at the... Yep, alright.
[244:37.48]Is this back at the scrapyard?
[244:41.02]Yeah, alright.
[244:45.10]Let's go.
[244:45.56]Let's go.
[244:52.84]Ooh, there's a corpse here I missed.
[244:54.22]No room in inventory.
[244:57.60]Shit.
[244:58.80]I need those nails.
[244:59.40]What was that?
[245:05.06]Oh, never mind.
[245:28.76]Just get me out of here.
[245:29.50]Alright, what should I eat?
[245:35.67]What do you guys think?
[245:36.57]What do you think is the number one thing I should eat?
[245:45.95]Oh, never mind.
[245:46.35]I can't eat anything.
[245:47.23]That's what you guys would suggest.
[245:50.66]Right.
[245:51.06]I'm on a... Never mind.
[245:54.26]I have to eat the stuff that's in the fridge.
[245:56.46]Damn it.
[245:57.00]That sucks.
[245:59.38]I can't eat, like, loaded potato skins like somebody just said.
[246:02.00]I have to eat lettuce.
[246:07.08]Like, plain meat.
[246:10.13]I have to do a FODMAP diet for, like, a week or two.
[246:15.61]Would you guys know how hard it is to do a FODMAP diet?
[246:21.35]A FODMAP diet is you cannot have any form of garlic or onion or fructose.
[246:28.98]Essentially.
[246:29.76]It's a carbohydrate thing.
[246:31.96]And weirdly enough, garlic and onion is in every single goddamn food in this entire country of the United States of America.
[246:44.02]Garlic powder, onion salt, onion powder.
[246:46.28]It's in everything.
[246:47.12]It's in every single food in the whole country.
[246:51.51]So I can't really go out to eat until I figure that out.
[246:58.21]Oh, and I love onions.
[246:59.73]Okay, hold on.
[247:01.91]I love onions.
[247:02.97]I love garlic.
[247:03.61]It's one of my favorite things on Earth, but I cannot eat it for a while.
[247:07.77]It's an unfortunate thing.
[247:09.99]I got a lot of gas, so I'm good to go.
[247:13.45]Sell this magazine.
[247:16.49]No, I think I can... Let's just turn it on.
[247:20.06]I got plenty of gas.
[247:22.24]But now, I need to block this door.
[247:32.72]I ain't dying.
[247:44.97]Okay.
[248:07.92]Okay, it's in here.
[248:09.60]The window is boarded up.
[248:11.84]This one is.
[248:13.48]This one is.
[248:14.24]There all are.
[248:14.92]Alright, hurry up.
[248:35.53]We're good.
[248:36.55]I think.
[248:45.38]Right?
[248:45.80]That's good, right?
[248:48.64]What did you do?
[248:49.04]I don't have time to change this.
[249:03.04]Oh, no.
[249:03.56]That's not good.
[249:03.98]I don't have time to change it.
[249:05.57]I don't have time to change it.
[249:06.43]I don't have time to do it.
[249:07.13]I don't have time to do it.
[249:07.81]I don't have time to do it.
[249:09.71]It has to stay.
[249:10.35]It's going to stand right there.
[249:11.79]Change it.
[249:26.37]Oh, I think I just got it.
[249:27.07]Okay, that's the door, right?
[249:32.59]The door is right there, right?
[249:46.80]I'm ready.
[249:53.14]Traps.
[249:53.44]You need traps.
[249:54.08]Traps.
[249:54.42]Traps.
[249:55.98]Bear trap.
[250:00.49]Should I put it down, like, right here?
[250:01.43]What should I do?
[250:04.79]Should I just put it... Up here?
[250:09.49]In front of the windows.
[250:10.29]Can they get in the windows?
[250:13.65]They can't get in the windows, right?
[250:19.45]Yes?
[250:19.75]Yes?
[250:52.25]Ah!
[251:16.37]Top window.
[251:51.82]My phone just turned on because somebody texted me.
[252:12.86]This is the safe room.
[252:16.52]Somebody right here.
[252:17.02]Oh, they're right here.
[252:41.85]What's that?
[252:42.56]Why is it blinking?
[252:45.14]Almost done.
[252:45.58]I have a lot of stuff to sell, too.
[253:01.27]I'm very shiny?
[253:07.07]Shit.
[253:16.09]Alright, we're good.
[253:18.01]This is the strategy.
[253:18.97]Just load this room up with complete and total traps.
[253:25.43]Big beer roll in the way.
[253:26.30]Nobody's going to get in here.
[253:35.40]I should have enough money to do some stuff too.
[253:39.85]How do I get out?
[253:40.57]Well, I don't have to get out until tomorrow morning.
[253:42.15]So I'll be fine.
[253:49.82]Oh, I just kind of ruined that, sorry.
[253:51.68]8 AM.
[253:51.86]Day 8.
[253:52.02]Cool!
[254:21.95]I have something to show you.
[254:23.43]No, I don't.
[254:24.37]I thought I got a, uh, like a dress or something.
[254:27.37]Alright, let's get rid of this.
[254:28.52]I have something to stash, too.
[254:48.84]I ate the dress.
[254:49.82]Did I?
[254:50.10]I don't think so.
[254:56.41]Shiny stone.
[254:57.27]I got two shiny stones.
[254:59.32]Get rid of the meat.
[255:01.28]Let's do... Yeah, I'm gonna make a ton of money right here.
[255:06.32]That could have been in the game.
[255:10.56]I don't know. 275.
[255:22.45]And I could get an axe blade.
[255:26.67]That's the play.
[255:32.86]What are you doing?
[255:38.30]That's the play.
[255:41.41]Axe blade.
[255:43.19]Do I need an axe handle?
[255:51.01]Yes.
[255:53.84]Shovel blade shovel axe blade What do you think stupid What do you think stupid
[256:27.11]I'm getting it.
[256:34.14]Alright, press 1 in the chat if it's Axeblade.
[256:36.56]Press 2 in the chat if it's Shovel.
[256:37.64]Go.
[256:52.91]Somebody said 420.
[256:58.16]Done.
[257:01.30]Done.
[257:04.08]Regardless, that's the outcome that's gonna play out here.
[257:06.38]I'm also gonna get more wire.
[257:10.04]You only have one wire.
[257:13.01]What are you... What are you, stupid?
[257:16.05]What do you think, stupid?
[257:17.19]Okay.
[257:30.37]So... Alright.
[257:35.35]Let's get this shit in here.
[257:37.76]Gasoline.
[257:38.44]Gasoline.
[257:39.04]How much gasoline do I have?
[257:40.18]Is there a sort inventory?
[257:43.00]By type or something?
[257:43.86]Another battery.
[257:47.08]Three batteries.
[257:49.82]Alcohol.
[257:51.27]Rag.
[257:51.73]Matchsticks.
[257:54.31]Yes, your mouse.
[257:58.67]Okay.
[258:00.34]Sword it yourself.
[258:03.72]Alright, okay.
[258:05.26]Scrap metal, scrap metal.
[258:06.97]In Blizzard games, I just press a button and it does it.
[258:16.03]Blizzomegalard.
[258:39.18]Those traps would be fine for a while.
[258:41.08]Make another lockpick.
[258:45.34]So this... I got two of these, right?
[258:46.68]No, I only have one of these?
[258:48.24]What?
[258:50.50]This game is not even good.
[258:52.84]I have one lockpick.
[258:54.60]Not even remotely fun.
[258:56.60]Alright, um...
[259:05.24]What do you mean I set off chat?
[259:06.22]What are you talking about?
[259:13.16]Everybody relax.
[259:15.82]Why don't you see how easy it is for me to control my chatroom?
[259:21.85]See?
[259:39.71]So how do I make this?
[259:40.65]Upgrade item?
[259:42.13]Repair item?
[259:43.77]Can I... Hold on, can I... Do I have to just hold this thing like a big lollipop?
[259:48.35]And hit people with the head?
[259:49.21]Does that work?
[260:01.23]No.
[260:05.50]You need a workbench upgrade...
[260:08.96]I'll be able to craft more items and fit more upgrades into weapons when I upgrade my workbench and I need a toolbox.
[260:16.88]The generator's still on.
[260:18.30]God.
[260:19.26]Crap.
[260:30.70]It's alright.
[260:34.52]Alright.

[260:38.54]Upgrade workbench.
[260:39.44]I need like a... I don't... Where do I get the tool thing?
[260:46.44]I don't know.
[260:48.59]I still have everything that I needed for before.
[260:52.73]I'll be alright.
[260:53.35]Alright, store this.

[261:35.88]Okay, I got those knives.
[261:54.23]Lockpick watch torches board with extra nails.
[262:02.37]I'm going up this way to the wolf's camp.
[262:08.94]What does that mean there's actually wolves here?
[262:13.80]Okay, let's try this.
[262:15.82]I wish I could save scum this game.
[262:17.22]I would do it every time.
[262:26.57]I'd be such a scumbag.
[262:31.20]Alright, here we go.
[262:33.00]Up here.
[262:33.32]I'm just going to check it out.
[262:34.56]I'm going to explore everything.
[262:41.53]Antlers will sell for $150.
[262:42.59]Really?
[262:46.81]Why did you say it like that?
[262:50.63]Okay, let's go.
[262:52.09]This way, over to the left.
[263:00.95]Alright, be easy here.
[263:03.33]Wolf's camp.
[263:12.21]Weird shadow.
[263:12.93]I got all day.
[263:16.63]I got the board out.
[263:19.13]I'm looking for mushroom.
[263:19.95]I need to do the mushroom shit.
[263:28.04]I can smell your stench from far away, meat.
[263:33.03]Isn't this a guy?
[263:35.33]Didn't this guy come to my house?
[263:41.46]Is this a bite?
[263:47.94]Will he eat it out of my hand?
[263:52.33]Oh.
[263:53.75]Yes, meat?
[263:55.09]Gossip.
[263:56.05]If I were you, I wouldn't venture too far from here unless you get bored of your lousy life, meat.
[264:00.87]Only a few return from the dense woods.
[264:03.13]And those who made it back were not able to share their happy stories.
[264:06.81]Hee hee hee.
[264:09.40]What do you got?
[264:13.64]He's got a chain.
[264:16.46]You also have a watch.
[264:19.68]You got wires, too?
[264:20.76]I don't know.
[264:21.52]I can't really...
[264:23.84]Alright.
[264:24.28]Uh, show item.
[264:28.18]Beautiful item.
[264:30.35]Wouldn't recommend, don't wander around.
[264:37.95]Wait, what'd he have?
[264:38.65]He had a toolbox?
[264:48.59]What is he like?
[264:52.20]I'm not trading watch for toolbox.
[264:53.60]He likes meat.
[264:58.79]Bed.
[264:59.41]Do we have any of this stuff here?
[265:15.42]Your meat.
[265:16.04]He likes biscuits.
[265:18.12]He likes weapons and ammo.
[265:19.26]Okay.
[265:20.54]So if I have any weapons or ammo, I'm gonna bring it back to this guy and then get the toolbox.
[265:24.82]Well, thanks.
[265:25.24]That was fun.
[265:26.04]Uh, I'm gonna go this way now.
[265:28.89]Should I bury this?
[265:29.63]Should I just bury this in the back of his head?
[265:32.19]And take it?
[265:33.57]No.
[265:42.39]No.
[265:42.83]This isn't DayZ.
[265:47.01]Oh, hey, man.
[265:47.53]I just want to say hello.
[265:49.55]I like your... You want to be our team up in that friend?
[265:55.43]Happens every time.
[266:02.91]Oh, shit.
[266:03.33]Nice.
[266:10.80]Anytime there's two people that come up to you in those games, they're always going to kill you.
[266:16.62]Because they're in a chat together, hanging out.
[266:19.20]They're in a separate Skype call.
[266:22.14]And you're not in that call.
[266:26.21]You're dead.
[266:32.91]I'm just using Skype as a reference point.
[266:34.91]Discord, fine.
[266:41.64]And... No, that's not incorrect, because...
[266:46.09]DayZ is not popular anymore.
[266:48.27]It was really popular when Skype was really, really popular too.
[266:51.23]So that does, I don't need to retract that statement.
[266:58.79]$150.
[266:59.35]$150.
[266:59.43]Somebody said it.
[267:00.32]Here, me.
[267:09.38]They keep saying it weirdly though.
[267:17.03]Holy shit, he's... He fights.
[267:20.45]He... And he's very, very powerful.
[267:22.37]Why did you tell me to do this?
[267:30.07]I was under the assumption... No, I ain't gonna kill this fucking thing.
[267:33.52]Are you kidding me?
[267:36.88]I'm chasing after an elf with a board with nails in it.
[267:39.42]You think I'm gonna win?
[268:06.17]There's a trap.
[268:07.07]Hold on.
[268:07.41]Leer him into the trap.
[268:08.25]Leer him into the trap.
[268:25.90]HIT HIM!
[268:28.08]HIT HIM!
[268:29.20]HIT HIM!
[268:29.52]PLEASE GOD!
[268:33.40]My voice just cracked four times.
[268:40.28]Imagine seeing... There they are.
[268:46.70]They weren't kidding.
[268:47.84]150, though.
[268:48.58]Liar.
[268:51.42]I pressed too hard down on the horn.
[268:53.97]You know when you squeeze a horn, really?
[268:57.91]Instead of going like... It goes like... That's what I just did.
[269:10.96]Alright, I got an elk.
[269:16.47]By the way, that's what happens anytime somebody's voices crack.
[269:20.16]They're pushing too hard on their stomach horn.
[269:22.50]I have to... I didn't get a heal.
[269:40.17]Is that a tree or is it goo?
[269:41.39]I don't know.
[269:43.95]Ooh, what's over here?
[269:46.09]Ooh, broken down tractor.
[269:48.43]I don't mind if I loot it.
[270:02.70]Battery.
[270:05.63]Oh no, what do I do?
[270:06.49]How do I do, what do I do with this?
[270:10.14]What's useless here?
[270:10.98]I'm just going to make some stuff.
[270:12.60]Hold on.
[270:13.24]I got a fucking battery, dude.
[270:17.44]Lockpick.
[270:19.55]And another bandage.
[270:22.87]Battery, mate.
[270:23.99]Nice.
[270:24.29]I don't know what it's for, but nice.
[270:36.32]What do I do with that?
[270:39.98]Does dog like batteries?
[270:42.62]Broken tractor, I'm here.
[270:49.46]Maybe I can sell the battery to the dog.
[270:52.13]Well, it's not a weapon, but you know.
[270:53.73]You understand.
[270:57.59]And I think that's enough facecam for tonight.
[271:05.01]Okay, I'm going back.

[278:18.82]Thanks for the emote!
[278:23.43]Wrong capitalization.
[278:24.95]Was it really?
[278:30.57]I really am just like shiny right now.
[278:36.07]It's a scary game.
[278:37.65]My blood pressure's going up.
[278:42.29]Alright, let me think about what I'm going to do here.
[278:43.81]I have trap set up.
[278:44.75]Everything's good to go.
[278:45.64]I have my fighting stick.
[278:50.04]Close this door.
[278:50.82]Push this back to where it was.
[278:53.48]That's good.
[278:55.82]Alright, I didn't turn on the generator.
[278:58.67]Okay.
[279:12.27]You think antlers are wood.
[279:13.49]And you wonder why we call you an idiot.
[279:48.39]I love how one of these is, can you eat deer antlers?
[279:57.69]Why would you do that?
[280:09.63]I typed in, what's the material for antlers?
[280:12.87]It's not bone.
[280:13.59]It's not cartilage.
[280:14.91]It's not made out of bone or kerosene, whatever the hell the thing was.
[280:18.53]It's cartilage.
[280:19.17]It's a cartilage material that's wood-like.
[280:21.23]That's what it said.
[280:22.13]It said it's a cartilage material that is wood-esque.
[280:25.17]Wood-esque.
[280:33.59]Although not wood.
[280:34.73]It is a wood-esque substance that comes from cartilage.
[280:37.77]Not bone.
[280:38.25]Not kerosene.
[280:41.68]Yes, I'm intentionally saying the word kerosene.
[280:44.42]Intentionally.
[280:46.00]For all of you here.
[280:47.10]Where are you?
[280:47.60]Over here?
[280:48.00]There you are.
[280:48.68]For all of you here that think I'm doing this on purpose, I am.
[280:51.98]I said kerosene instead of keratin.
[280:54.00]Okay?
[280:55.09]There, all of you.
[280:58.69]Oh, fuck, I have to leave.
[281:03.69]I blocked myself out of the room.
[281:16.20]OH!
[281:16.42]THE GENERATOR!
[281:18.52]I FORGOT ABOUT THE GENERATOR!
[281:29.69]Get it on.
[281:38.97]Safe.
[281:43.06]Thanks guys.
[281:45.19]You, you really saved me there.
[281:47.49]You really got me saved there.
[281:49.15]Thanks a lot, guys.
[282:03.52]That one pressed J. Why would I press J?
[282:05.24]Why do you want me to press J?
[282:13.40]Is there something I need to do?
[282:14.32]What does it do?
[282:27.67]Cool.
[282:32.15]I'm begging you, don't.
[282:44.92]Cool, thanks guys.
[283:13.57]Into the damn savages everything should go smoothly.
[283:16.97]I don't remember anything since the attack on our camp.
[283:21.11]Somehow I'm wearing a coat.
[283:24.09]So I must have changed my clothes on my way here.
[283:26.57]I don't recognize myself anymore.
[283:28.85]I can barely hold this pencil.
[283:30.77]Has my body changed?
[283:31.81]I no longer feel hunger or thirst.
[283:34.11]What is happening to me?
[283:37.17]I remember his face, the face of the man who saved me, then held me captive.
[283:41.83]I don't know how I managed to escape his hut, ended up here.
[283:44.77]What I do know is that the insane fucker took my key, my only chance to get out of the woods.
[283:50.58]He also took out all the pages from my journal.
[283:54.12]I doubt that he was able to learn the location of the underground passage, though.
[283:58.79]I should check if the door is still locked.
[284:00.83]Just to be sure, I must find him.
[284:03.73]I don't think he still lives in the same place where he held me.
[284:06.17]It makes no difference as I have no idea how to get back to that vile place.
[284:14.60]The time's not going forward.
[284:16.60]I thought that was going to be burning time.
[284:23.50]Now my hands are tingly because I leaned back.
[284:38.21]That was a yawn that, that was almost a yawn.
[284:40.63]But don't yawn on stream because then people think you're bored or tired.
[284:45.17]Don't yawn on stream.
[284:46.96]That's a good tip for you.
[284:48.50]If you're gonna, if you're gonna be a streamer, don't yawn on stream.
[284:52.04]It makes people think that you're fucking tired and bored and not unsatisfied.
[284:56.15]Take it from me.
[285:15.65]Here they come.
[285:25.44]You can always tell when someone's trying to hold in a yawn.
[285:28.00]Because they look like a lizard that just ate a bug.
[285:33.68]There you go.
[285:41.39]If you didn't know.
[285:48.30]Speaking of lizards.
[285:52.16]Did I tell you guys that I was thinking about getting a couple of like frogs or like a bearded dragon?
[285:58.66]Did I tell you guys this?
[286:00.73]I'm thinking about getting a bearded dragon.
[286:05.65]And they're like so cool.
[286:10.07]Or like a couple of tree frogs.
[286:13.49]They're real chill.
[286:14.20]Yeah, I've heard that they're awesome.
[286:23.62]Get a crested gecko?
[286:24.76]That was one of them too.
[286:32.20]I'm not being attacked, right?
[286:36.07]Baby tree frogs?
[286:37.55]You'd be an awesome frog dad.
[286:38.93]Yeah.
[286:49.88]Which door?
[286:54.75]Oh, they're in the house now.
[286:55.59]Okay.
[286:56.92]They can- they- I- I was just being too loud, and my, like, roommate banged on the wall.
[287:08.71]Oh, fuck.
[287:09.31]What do I do about this?
[287:13.07]What do I do about this?
[287:15.07]Do I just have to let him come in?
[287:16.59]And then step in the trap and then kill him?
[287:19.56]I'm ready.
[287:23.69]No, he's not coming in.
[287:27.52]No, okay, this is plenty of HP on it.
[287:32.64]I'm not, I don't think he'll get through it today.
[287:35.44]He'll be back tomorrow.
[287:47.65]Oh god, they're not going at the other doors, are they?
[287:58.98]I'm kidding, that wasn't real.
[288:00.08]I just made so many people yawn.
[288:11.85]For a second I didn't recognize the jermaSour emote.
[288:14.37]I thought it was a Jerma Yawn emote.
[288:16.59]They could both be the same thing.
[288:18.41]That's the start of a yawn.
[288:20.07]Or Jeremy just ate a bug and he's a lizard.
[288:23.84]It has endless possibilities, I think.
[288:31.05]Why are there bugs in here?
[288:37.88]Come on.
[288:51.07]Hurry up and turn to Dawn.
[288:54.15]Before he gets in.
[288:58.08]No!
[289:01.82]Alright, we're good.
[289:09.01]Day number nine.
[289:11.79]Day nine.
[289:13.77]Gained reputation 100.
[289:15.17]Now is when I go get the box. 104.
[289:29.61]I want the toolbox.
[289:30.79]Should I get a couple of these though?
[289:32.47]I don't want any of these.
[289:42.76]Get the box.
[289:43.44]Get the box.
[289:44.84]Get the box.
[289:45.82]Okay, hold on.
[289:48.98]Time is frozen right now in the house.
[289:51.13]Yeah, I know.
[289:54.13]I know.
[289:57.23]What do I want to sell?
[290:01.00]The antlers.
[290:10.15]Don't sell the antlers.
[290:13.07]Sell the wood.
[290:15.29]Should I sell the antlers?
[290:17.21]Does that mean that's 100, right?
[290:18.23]150?
[290:19.23]That'll give me 200.
[290:21.07]Now, this reputation with this trader, is that the same thing with the dog guy?
[290:26.68]So if I have 200 now, I have to sell it to the dog guy.
[290:30.41]So sell antlers to dog guy.
[290:33.33]And then find a gun.
[290:37.77]Alright, I need to fix the walls there.
[290:40.95]How many do I need?
[290:41.55]Let's get a gasoline can here.
[290:44.28]And you know what?
[290:46.80]We're talking abundance.
[290:49.70]I've got so much money.
[290:51.30]You know what I mean?
[290:52.54]I've got so much money.
[290:53.48]I'm just going to dump the whole thing in here.
[290:56.10]I've got so much gas.
[290:57.06]I've got too much money.
[290:58.44]Let's do it.
[291:06.28]Except don't do that, because there's no reason to do that, because why would I do that?
[291:09.19]We're going to put the rest in here.
[291:15.03]What difficulty am I on?
[291:16.03]This is on the second highest.
[291:18.03]I believe it's called Nightmare.
[291:20.87]Or whatever it is, like Extra Hard.
[291:29.40]Okay, that's fine.
[291:40.19]What was that?
[291:42.67]That was just one of those fake guns that when you pull the thing, it makes that rotator thing spin in the back and it goes like... You guys know what I'm talking about?
[291:53.21]They're the toys.
[291:56.96]I need to hear that again.
[291:59.74]When you pull the trigger, you actually put pressure and you make a mechanism spin around and it clicks.
[292:05.60]You'll hear it and then you won't be able to unhear it.
[292:07.16]I'm not a taser.
[292:11.31]Okay, I need to fix... What does it take to fix it?
[292:18.69]This is fine.
[292:20.69]This is the one I have to fix down here.
[292:22.05]Don't step in it.
[292:24.61]Dismantle it.
[292:29.57]Barricade.
[292:30.83]Oh, no.
[292:31.85]I need six more needles.
[292:36.61]You got those, don't you?
[292:39.96]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[292:42.33]Why'd I do seven?
[292:46.43]Okay.
[292:47.37]Put it back on here.
[292:51.03]Um...
[293:09.30]I need a handle.
[293:12.25]Alright.
[293:15.55]Um... Alright.
[293:16.09]No, no, no.
[293:16.49]Right, right, right.
[293:17.09]I have to go turn on the... This way.
[293:21.79]I'm gonna make some more planks.
[293:24.35]Out of the wood.
[293:24.71]I think there's wood in here, too.
[293:25.59]Yeah, there's wood in here.
[293:31.27]Load it up.
[293:35.25]That's plenty.
[293:40.31]Show this guy the plastic duck.
[293:41.47]Didn't I already do that?
[293:44.07]The wood goes down here.
[293:55.90]Plastic duck.
[293:56.38]Yeah, I did this already.
[293:57.38]Didn't I?
[293:57.60]Yeah, you can.
[293:59.40]You can only show them a photo of the road.
[294:00.53]Alright, looking good.
[294:07.99]Settle into the next hideout soon.
[294:10.27]Down here.
[294:10.67]Alright.
[294:12.38]So... But does my work... I have to take all my tools and stuff with me, right?
[294:16.24]Does my work... Is it like Diablo?
[294:18.66]Where the stash down there is the same stash?
[294:25.75]That's not how this works.
[294:30.45]Oh, shit.
[294:31.25]I have to start to bring it down there then.
[294:38.12]Are you serious?
[294:38.96]There's a guy that does it for me.
[294:46.48]Okay.
[294:47.06]Alright.
[294:47.28]Well, for the meantime, I need to get that.
[294:52.16]I gotta go to Wolf's camp.
[294:53.64]I gotta bring him shit that he wants.
[294:57.61]Antlers.
[295:00.05]Bring the meat with me.
[295:04.19]Am I gonna find some more stuff?
[295:05.29]I have to sell him something that he's gonna want.
[295:08.03]It's 200.
[295:08.45]Adventure time.
[295:12.38]No, no, not the show!
[295:13.94]Not the show!
[295:18.62]The game!
[295:19.16]I'm sorry.
[295:28.27]I probably scared a few people.
[295:29.41]Let's go.
[295:38.42]Uh... In the meantime, I... Let me... I hear, like, somebody screaming.
[295:48.64]Oh, those are dogs.
[295:49.26]Okay.
[295:50.68]There are a couple of chests down here that I probably can find.
[295:53.42]Two lockpicks.
[295:55.54]Let's go for it.
[296:00.42]I remember there's one...
[296:05.40]shut up shut up shut up don't don't even where are you what what why who is going like let's just right here dude
[296:38.70]Don't even need a lockpick.
[296:42.64]Oh, hell yeah.
[296:44.51]I can do another upgrade now.
[296:46.73]Nice.
[296:48.45]Backpack, too.
[296:49.57]Ooh.
[296:51.19]It's like ten feet away from my house.
[296:54.09]Anything else over here?
[297:00.11]Look at the chests.
[297:08.99]And then we have to go up to the wolf.
[297:17.47]Slow down.
[297:19.10]It's only 9 a.m.
[297:19.92]That's plenty of time.
[297:20.70]There's an amazing chest ahead.
[297:26.26]Ahead where?
[297:28.26]What does that mean?
[297:40.07]No chest.
[297:44.97]I thought there was another one.
[297:49.71]Hey, fellas.
[297:50.47]VOD here.
[297:51.22]Jerm was about to die.
[297:52.32]LOL.
[297:52.54]I want to make sure I tackle this one head on.
[297:59.72]No, I am not about to die.
[298:01.12]That doesn't happen.
[298:02.50]Don't listen to random people in chat that say incorrect stuff.
[298:07.27]Wish you were here, by the way.
[298:27.00]Alright, we're at the camp, but there's got to be something else over here, right?
[298:30.34]Something secret.
[298:36.62]No.
[298:40.11]Well, here I am.
[298:45.59]Here.
[298:48.45]I brought something for you.
[298:52.78]I have antlers for you.
[298:56.97]I need 100 more dollars.
[298:57.89]90 more, actually.
[299:08.64]Well, I'll just take that.
[299:17.38]Me too.
[299:18.92]What about drugs?
[299:23.74]Do you do drugs?
[299:29.30]No.
[299:30.20]I'll find something.
[299:31.22]I'll be back.
[299:34.99]Stay there.
[299:35.37]I'll be back.
[299:39.27]I'm thinking over here there'll be a chest.
[299:56.70]I gotta be careful I don't break this.
[299:58.59]It's my only means of protection.
[300:01.19]That would be bad.
[300:01.95]I don't even... You don't get experience.
[300:05.03]It happens and it scares the shit out of me every time.
[300:10.27]Every single time.
[300:12.21]No, I need to sell.
[300:13.39]I just need that toolbox so I can get out of here.
[300:15.87]I need to go down to that silent forest.
[300:25.20]Get me out of here.
[300:28.12]I'm just going for it now.
[300:30.34]No, not enough time.
[300:31.40]There's plenty of time.
[300:32.20]I'm going for it right now.
[300:33.10]Let's go.
[300:34.38]I got tools.
[300:40.57]Catch your breath.
[300:47.81]Down to this hideout.
[300:52.01]And that's how we find a chest.
[300:59.43]Not that cool, actually.
[301:01.37]Kind of shitty.
[301:03.31]Not really that cool.
[301:08.38]Down here is the forest.
[301:11.90]I'm not going to stop.
[301:12.78]I'm just going to go into the new hideout.
[301:19.21]Which is down...
[301:27.86]Does it go all the way?
[301:28.60]No, people don't spawn in here, right?
[301:33.16]Right?
[301:34.58]I'm taking out the light.
[301:35.44]3-3-3-3-3.
[301:38.44]Wait, I already did 3-3-3-3-3-3, didn't I?
[301:39.52]Wait, 3-3-3 is the password for every single door?
[301:45.24]That's not secure.
[302:05.61]What's going on?
[302:06.07]Oh, it's a shortcut.
[302:12.32]I see.
[302:15.42]Alright, let's do it.
[302:21.18]Let's go.
[302:21.94]Alright.

[303:46.87]Wait.
[303:52.61]Uh, okay.
[303:53.45]I don't like the noises.
[303:56.21]Um... What do the drugs do?
[303:59.51]Just take them.
[304:00.17]Should I just take the drugs?
[304:01.53]I'm gonna take the drugs.
[304:02.32]What do they do?
[304:02.92]Somebody help me.
[304:04.74]What do they do?
[304:10.42]Alcohol.

[304:24.55]Okay.
[304:25.94]Free bottles.
[304:29.42]Staff of the shovel?
[304:30.32]What?
[304:30.78]Is that real?
[304:32.14]Wait, I already have a stick.
[304:35.36]I have a stick already.
[304:39.93]I have a stick in my inventory already.
[304:41.67]Take another stick.
[304:45.61]I have to make a decision now.
[304:47.19]I'm wasting so much time.
[304:48.09]Match sticks?
[304:49.93]Or take the drugs?
[304:53.15]Or... The one wire?
[305:00.61]Make a lockpick.
[305:01.37]I only have one wire.
[305:04.17]Put drugs on the stick.
[305:05.36]Eat the pills.
[305:09.71]Okay, that was worth it.
[305:10.91]Where'd the stick go?
[305:15.01]I have no idea where the stick is and I kind of don't care.
[305:20.01]I have to... This thing's going to break.
[305:24.82]I have to start using this.
[305:25.64]It's going to break.
[305:26.34]I don't want to break that thing yet.

[335:15.24]Look through the keyhole.
[335:19.84]Something in there.
[335:21.35]Come.
[335:21.69]What is in there?
[335:22.75]Is it like a face?
[335:24.59]Okay.
[335:25.57]Come to me.
[335:27.43]It opened.
[335:43.43]Follow the shiny stones.
[335:55.13]Hope I get to keep them
[336:24.17]I feel... I'm uncomfortable at the moment.
[336:32.40]Dude, have I got full stacks?
[336:33.80]Almost.
[336:36.70]Turn on the lamp.
[336:43.08]Are they gonna get up?
[336:48.64]Uh... Yeah, and...
[337:11.55]That's a person lying down.
[337:13.07]Should I turn it off?
[337:17.20]Okay.
[337:19.77]More shiny stones.
[337:59.82]Active skill menu.
[338:01.44]Moth.
[338:03.58]Okay, I just slept for like four minutes.
[338:09.13]Interesting.
[338:10.05]There's still an animal here.
[338:12.17]Where's the guy that brings the stuff?
[338:14.85]Do I have to wait a day?
[338:16.25]I'm going to die here.
[338:21.43]I need nails.
[338:22.95]I'm dead.
[338:23.82]I have to literally run back.
[338:34.08]Backpack.
[338:34.96]Where?
[338:39.42]Oh.
[338:39.56]I don't have time.
[338:44.02]I'm almost out of time.
[338:46.47]Almost out of time.
[338:47.11]Ugh.
[339:03.94]Did I have any nails?
[339:16.75]It's all messed up now.
[339:18.61]Nails.
[339:22.23]Barricade that shit.
[339:23.23]I don't have any nails.
[339:25.41]I can't.
[339:30.72]Use bottles as traps.
[339:34.02]Okay, I need to... Oh, this is bad.
[339:35.22]This is bad.
[339:35.58]What do I do?
[339:36.64]I have to block all doors.
[339:40.21]I have to do what I have to do.
[339:41.47]Everything is stored, right?
[339:43.43]Okay.
[339:44.83]Shiny stone.
[339:45.43]I can put it over here.
[339:48.73]Come here.
[339:55.02]Get in the bathroom.
[339:55.74]Good idea.
[339:59.88]Where's the bathroom?
[340:00.70]Right here?
[340:01.42]Alright.
[340:01.94]Put the tub over here.
[340:05.03]I need a lamp in here.
[340:06.10]I need a light.
[340:06.64]I need a light source.
[340:08.46]Hurry up.
[340:09.04]Where's the light?
[340:09.68]Lamp?
[340:09.96]Right here.
[340:22.67]Okay.
[340:22.95]Block this with the bathtub.
[340:28.29]I'm going.
[340:28.71]I'm going.
[340:28.97]I'm going.
[340:29.21]I'm going.
[340:29.51]I'm not going to panic.
[340:33.95]Good to go.
[340:34.67]Okay.
[340:36.80]Close this.
[340:37.24]Bring the dresser over here.
[340:38.20]This is just like when you actually move a piece of furniture.
[340:48.51]Get it in long ways.
[340:59.37]Start turning it.
[341:03.92]I can turn the generator on.
[341:14.85]Hold on, move this.
[341:21.28]I'm like looking over here constantly for like reassurance.
[341:26.22]That's a good spot.
[341:26.88]Alright, let's turn the generator on.
[341:44.30]No, just forget it.
[341:46.87]Turn it on.
[341:48.87]I'm fine.
[341:49.75]Okay, then... You got it.
[341:52.25]I got this.
[341:52.63]I got this.
[341:53.23]I got this.
[341:53.79]I do.
[341:54.11]Okay, got this.
[341:56.29]Get back in the window.
[341:59.47]And then the bathroom is good.
[342:01.59]I'm gonna sit here and just be quiet.
[342:05.21]Pull this in here.
[342:09.37]And then block this door.
[342:25.45]Hey, you know those things.
[342:26.83]Okay.
[342:39.46]I did it.
[342:39.76]Let's just stand here.
[342:45.02]What if the light goes out?
[342:46.56]It won't.
[343:08.34]Get yourself in the corner.
[343:10.28]This is the corner.
[343:11.82]Stay in the center.
[343:21.54]Should I?
[343:37.06]Corner, like this corner?
[343:39.96]I don't know what corner you guys want me to stand in.
[343:47.35]Get in the tub.
[344:21.90]Why am I crying?
[344:23.52]Because it's scary, man.
[344:26.76]Alright, as long... I need to pay attention because I would have just seen where they were coming in from.
[344:33.63]Oh my god.
[344:35.15]He opened it with ease.
[344:36.93]He just pushed it with his face.
[344:38.11]They can break the bathtubs, guys.
[344:43.31]What an excellent choice of barricade it was.
[344:45.59]It's made out of ceramic.
[344:47.53]It can be broken.
[344:48.31]You can break a bathtub by putting a boot on it.
[344:53.38]I'm not gonna move.
[345:12.31]All of you say in bottom right corner, you're the real, real gameplay aficionados.
[345:23.28]If I was standing in that top left corner... Don't come back in here.
[345:39.03]What's that mean?
[345:40.21]What's that mean?
[345:41.47]What's that mean?
[345:42.81]What's that mean?
[345:44.37]What's that mean?
[345:46.85]What's that mean?
[345:48.29]What's that mean?
[345:50.05]What's that mean?
[345:58.90]Oh my god!
[346:01.84]They've breached!
[346:31.64]How many were there?
[346:32.44]That was like a hundred people.
[346:35.90]I almost had them all.
[346:37.50]There was like 30 or 40 people in that room.
[346:40.22]I got really greasy.
[346:44.24]I got really... Alright.
[346:48.48]We're never gonna forgive you.
[346:52.98]Don't look at the crow.
[346:55.26]Oh, that's a crow.
[346:57.19]That looked like a scary witch person.
[347:00.55]Uh, okay.
[347:06.41]It's been six hours.
[347:08.45]I think that's time to drain it down.
[347:11.39]We'll continue tomorrow.
[347:22.61]Yeah.
[347:24.21]We'll continue this tomorrow.
[347:27.34]Never gonna finish it?
[347:30.16]I've only got like two extra... I'm probably not gonna... I'll try.
[347:40.94]Go eat your no-onion diet, you freak.
[347:51.34]Hey!
[347:51.66]I'm talking about my health here.
[347:54.41]Alright, yeah, we'll continue tomorrow.
[347:56.79]I think, like, this six hours is a good stopping point.
[347:59.25]I'm all greasy.
[348:00.65]Games like this just stress me the fuck out.
[348:02.23]Like, it's cortisol levels are just probably... So high right now.
[348:08.74]But before I go...
[348:11.01]here's the this is me faint reflection in the semi-transparent visor of his helmet suddenly he starts to move quicker as if looking for something I mean I died here and I just unlocked this place so that's not even a problem there's no out of here he shows me what he's written and then he wipes it with a sleeve and continues scribbling we're stuck here with each other I have to make sure I've also read the second sentence what was that just like a you weren't paying attention
[348:37.76]The man takes out a full tank of gasoline from his sack he places on the floor.
[348:43.44]Thanks.
[348:46.99]Appreciate the full tank.
[348:49.09]Uh, I need to... Where is it?
[348:55.01]You said you put a full tank of gas down here.
[348:57.09]Is that a lie?
[348:57.63]It's right here.
[349:00.45]Alright.
[349:01.49]Ah.
[349:05.29]Upgrade workbench.
[349:06.17]I'll do this first.
[349:08.51]Because, I mean, I'm just here.
[349:10.23]Let's go.
[349:12.82]Bingo.
[349:13.48]Level 3.
[349:14.80]Now I can make a gun.
[349:19.00]I just need tape.
[349:19.74]The mushroom is rotting in my inventory.
[349:23.73]Oh, okay.
[349:24.47]Where the hell is it?
[349:30.77]480.
[349:30.97]I'm just...
[349:39.25]I tell you, before tomorrow's stream, I'm gonna eat, like, a nice, like, FODMAP fucking piece of fish.
[349:46.59]I'm gonna be ready tomorrow.
[349:48.57]I was ready today, too, but, you know, I'm gonna be... I'm gonna eat brainpower food tomorrow.
[350:00.18]With no garlic.
[350:01.00]No.
[350:01.50]None.
[350:03.48]That was 50 essence!
[350:04.92]Holy... Would it have been worth more if I...
[350:08.90]It's okay.
[350:10.68]Alright, I... Ration stamps?
[350:18.35]Is this code?
[350:19.23]Okay.
[350:32.85]Alright.
[350:33.58]I already did this.
[350:34.86]I have to turn off the generator.
[350:38.64]New emote tomorrow, or Riot.
[350:47.08]What?
[350:49.06]Are you guys gonna just keep bullying me into putting new emotes on the stream?
[350:59.17]Alright, is the game saved?
[351:00.85]The game is saved, I think.
[351:08.25]No.
[351:08.67]No.
[351:09.17]No new emote tomorrow.
[351:10.05]I gotta eat food and be ready.
[351:12.75]But that's it.
[351:13.53]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[351:14.29]We're gonna do the outro here.
[351:17.25]Darkwood's fun.
[351:19.39]We'll see how far we get tomorrow.
[351:25.60]Probably the same time.
[351:26.40]Somewhere around like 1 or 2.
[351:27.26]See you guys tomorrow.
[351:32.04]For more Darkwood.
[351:34.70]No new emote tomorrow.
[351:41.81]Did it work?
[351:43.43]Did it work?
[351:45.11]Did it work?
[351:47.69]Come on.
[351:53.01]I don't understand this thing.
[351:59.00]I don't get this thing.
[352:00.50]Why is it keeping this for... What?
[352:07.79]I even tried to reset it and change it.
[352:10.85]He gifts 100 subs every stream.
[352:12.93]Wow.
[352:17.42]Why can I not get this to work?
[352:21.80]Because this is a different session.
[352:24.96]What happens if I just do it again?
[352:26.30]Okay, like, how about this?
[352:28.75]How about... All-time top subgifter.
[352:36.49]Okay, that works.
[352:39.06]Session top sub gift.
[352:41.22]This is the session.
[352:43.38]By the way, a thousand subs?
[352:49.48]Right, I forgot about that.
[352:51.04]So why is this not working?
[352:52.20]Monthly top sub gifter.
[352:53.46]It's me.
[352:55.30]30 weekly top sub gifter.
[352:58.43]It's Clown Daddy.
[352:59.19]So why is session top sub gifter not working?
[353:11.01]I don't get it.
[353:15.59]That's odd.
[353:20.37]But, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[353:22.50]Thanks for being a little less messy inside of the theater.
[353:28.08]Just make it weekly, I guess.
[353:29.72]I have to figure out why it's doing that.
[353:32.86]Hope the stream has a better title tomorrow.
[353:35.20]I wish I could pick the game as Darkwood 1 and then make the title of the stream Darkwood 2.
[353:46.95]In fact, Darkwood... No, but I can't do Darkwood 2 because people would think it was a sequel.
[354:00.64]Darkwood 1 dash copy of Darkwood.
[354:09.23]That's funny.
[354:09.99]Okay, that's what it'll be.
[354:19.07]Darkwood 1-Shortcut.
[354:23.48]I like the Darkwood 1-Copy of Darkwood.
[354:30.34]No, this is a lot of fun, though.
[354:33.98]I am happy playing it again.
[354:36.72]We'll see how far we get tomorrow.
[354:38.20]So let's do the bits.
[354:40.14]Because this is still something I can't seem to figure out.
[354:46.17]I don't know.
[354:48.96]Anyways.
[354:55.14]Let's get to it.
[354:59.00]Thank you earlier.
[355:01.49]What happened to the Bitcoin donation?
[355:02.95]That doesn't exist anymore.
[355:05.29]I had an Ethereum address that was down there, and I think four or five dollars went through it over a year and a half.
[355:12.09]I don't have that down there anymore.
[355:17.57]It's all good, though.
[355:18.89]But, thank you to... Oh, wait a second.
[355:22.25]This is the wrong music.
[355:25.83]This is saved, I think, right?
[355:28.50]Should be.
[355:30.52]Are you sure you want to quit?
[355:31.34]You will lose any unsaved progress.
[355:32.52]Time since last save.
[355:33.86]5 minutes, 22 seconds.
[355:34.74]Yeah, that's fine.
[355:38.08]That's okay.
[355:45.39]That's what I was looking for.
[355:48.14]Thank you to Gibbler for the thousand bits way, way, way, way back.
[355:58.54]I don't like scary games.
[356:01.73]I don't really do well with scary games either.
[356:05.71]But, you know.
[356:08.45]I remember somebody saying, wow, you really are like overreacting today.
[356:12.95]No, I just, I drank two coffees and I played a horror game.
[356:16.02]That's kind of what happens.
[356:19.26]Super over-actor today.
[356:24.54]Rate my fridge out of 10.
[356:26.12]My current fridge is probably like 7.
[356:28.01]Like 6.
[356:31.23]But thank you, Gibbler.
[356:31.85]Appreciate it.
[356:32.35]Thank you, FritoMan, for the 1500 bits.
[356:34.63]Finally caught a livestream.
[356:36.11]Been watching the stream archive for the past two weeks while grinding MMOs after work.
[356:40.44]It's been a blast.
[356:41.56]Here's a small token of appreciation.
[356:42.92]Also, Play Indivisible just got released.
[356:44.92]I actually saw that.
[356:50.46]I've seen pretty mixed things about it, though.
[356:54.02]People seem to really like that game or really not like that game.
[357:01.45]Seems interesting, though.
[357:06.41]It's like an RPG, right?
[357:07.51]Turn-based?
[357:17.10]We'll see.
[357:18.42]It is currently on Steam now, but thank you for the recommendation.
[357:20.88]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[357:24.45]DubskiDude, thank you for the 250 bits.
[357:27.15]Appreciate it.
[357:28.51]This game is concrete proof that you are in fact an on-demand streamer.
[357:32.43]Been waiting to say that for months.
[357:33.74]Thanks for playing this game, by the way.
[357:35.08]Darkwood is fantastic.
[357:37.56]On-demand streamer?
[357:41.40]What do you mean?
[357:45.18]It says, gifting yourself subs is a way to avoid taxes.
[357:49.45]Uh, no.
[357:55.67]No, actually.
[357:56.57]You can turn the content on demand.
[358:08.56]The truth comes out.
[358:09.50]Uh, no, that's not how it works.
[358:16.24]The money gets taxed twice.
[358:19.14]Funny you say that.
[358:23.13]Anyway.
[358:26.31]Thank you, Dubsky.
[358:26.95]Appreciate it.
[358:30.09]Lewis.
[358:33.81]Thank you for the 400 bits.
[358:35.37]They say, wow.
[358:41.93]Wow.
[358:42.95]That's it.
[358:45.71]Appreciate it, Louis.
[358:47.83]Tony.
[358:48.39]Thank you, Tony, for the five community subs earlier.
[358:51.29]Tony Villanto.
[358:52.47]Villanti.
[358:53.79]Thank you.
[358:55.69]Green501 gave 300 bits earlier.
[358:59.65]They say, hello, Jermbimbo.
[359:02.79]Jermbimbo.
[359:03.95]Bimbo.
[359:04.89]Thank you.
[359:07.90]Thank you, Green501.
[359:16.20]101 dominations.
[359:17.00]Thank you for the 250 bits.
[359:20.60]Hey, Jerma, like a ton of people here, I've been a fan of you for a while.
[359:23.27]Whatever you play, you always manage to get a chuckle out of me.
[359:26.25]And turning on your stream when I wake up is like opening a door and seeing a friend in the doorway.
[359:30.95]Thank you.
[359:32.27]Thanks for what you do, and greetings from the expat community of South Korea.
[359:40.18]Thank you so much.
[359:44.59]Thank you for the 250 bits.
[359:48.47]I appreciate anybody that decides to watch this channel for more than 20 minutes.
[359:55.33]You know?
[359:56.87]If you've been here for a year, you've been here for a week, you've been here for 20 minutes.
[360:02.40]I hope you like it.
[360:02.92]Maybe we'll see you again.
[360:06.50]Thank you for anybody that watches this channel.
[360:12.04]Thank you, 101Dominations.
[360:20.76]Thank you, Sad Vega, for the 250 bits.
[360:23.00]They have a dog here.
[360:24.63]The dog emote.
[360:25.47]I used my gamer keyboard last week.
[360:28.35]I created a G key function in Vanilla WoW to buy a rare pattern before anyone else could.
[360:34.87]It did multiple macro functions at once within the period of a few seconds, making my life easier.
[360:39.94]I also have a key that I pressed that says Jerma short in Twitch chat while I play a game.
[360:44.74]I don't think you should have sent that in a message.
[360:50.28]I don't think that's legal.
[360:59.44]It's legal.
[361:00.15]Is it legal?
[361:04.49]I remember.
[361:05.19]Okay, this... I think there's a video of this happening.
[361:11.41]If you spun around in World of Warcraft fast enough, the game would disconnect you from the client.
[361:19.93]me mlc stealth inside there was another there was like two or three other people there but there was a video of this of mlc stealth spinning around at 5 000 miles per hour and he just gets booted and we just kept getting booted from the game
[361:39.51]You had to... It was a joke though.
[361:41.43]It was not, oh, let me just spin around with my mouse.
[361:44.09]You had to turn your DPI up to like 10,000.
[361:46.57]And then just have your character go like a blender in a circle.
[361:50.99]And you got like kicked out.
[361:58.97]This is a video from like 7 or 8 years ago.
[362:04.41]Longer than that probably.
[362:09.07]Sensitivity 999 million.
[362:16.70]Is it this?
[362:17.24]Let's see.
[362:23.32]Uh, yes.
[362:24.27]Yes, this is the video.
[362:25.91]Yes, this is it.
[362:26.65]You found it.
[362:27.51]Let's like, let's go adventure, or you're gonna like disconnect again.
[362:34.77]This is it.
[362:35.97]What was our names?
[362:37.65]I can't believe that like disconnects you.
[362:39.81]I'm going as fast as I can.
[362:44.05]Why isn't it working?
[362:45.65]My name is Tornado?
[362:47.84]Like tornado?
[362:48.82]Hold on a second.
[362:58.06]Tornado.
[363:08.65]Let me just put a browser in here.
[363:11.25]You know what I need to get?
[363:12.15]I need to figure out, as a live streamer, I need a good, like, extension that is just a web browser.
[363:18.09]That's just, you put something in here and it just plays the video.
[363:30.16]Does that work?
[363:30.86]How do I do that?
[363:33.90]LSDell's name is HotPocket.
[363:37.57]Because they used to eat them every day.
[363:39.87]Get VLC.
[363:40.65]Okay, hold on.
[363:44.79]Why is this not working?
[363:47.53]This is mildly irritating.
[363:56.47]Get on there!
[363:58.83]What is this doing?
[364:03.81]Fucking computers.
[364:06.25]Okay, browser source.
[364:08.53]Go ahead.
[364:09.49]I know you want to get on here.
[364:11.71]Why is this taking so long?
[364:13.95]No, not browser source two.
[364:17.97]No, not browser source two.
[364:20.15]What am I looking at here?
[364:22.93]This is about to play like... Okay, I don't know why this is playing.
[364:29.33]I didn't play this.
[364:39.30]That's the worst clip on my whole channel.
[364:41.18]It's Homer.
[364:41.46]Okay, here we go.
[364:41.88]You're signed out.
[364:42.36]Membership.
[364:42.60]Are you still here?
[364:43.14]Get out of here.
[364:43.76]I'm still here.
[364:44.18]Oh, no.
[364:44.44]Okay, he's gone.
[364:45.16]Yes, I got it.
[364:49.76]I understand.
[364:50.12]So, Hot Pocket.
[365:08.56]a.k.a.
[365:08.86]I'm gonna sleep still.
[365:11.46]Yeah.
[365:13.06]Let's go.
[365:13.74]Let's, like, let's go adventure.
[365:15.14]Or are you gonna, like, disconnect again?
[365:20.85]This is strange love.
[365:22.39]I can't believe that, like, disconnecting.
[365:24.49]I wonder how she's doing.
[365:25.99]It's been a while.
[365:26.83]I'm going as fast as I can.
[365:28.88]Why isn't it working?
[365:32.70]It's like he's having a seizure.
[365:38.32]There you go.
[365:42.24]Oh, no, he's still here.
[365:44.96]Oh, there I go.
[365:47.56]$2 mic.
[365:47.84]This is like eight years ago.
[365:49.46]I can't believe that actually works.
[365:51.70]Okay, I'm going to do it.
[365:52.28]So you're just wiggling the mouse around?
[365:54.12]Yeah.
[365:54.84]Hold right.
[365:55.72]Oh, no, there goes Jim.
[365:58.20]I want to see if this really works.
[365:59.72]You know, I'm like being a troll and pretending to do it.
[366:05.33]As fast as you can.
[366:06.23]Oh, there you go.
[366:06.97]It can't.
[366:19.38]Why is this a video?
[366:27.63]You just have like a realization.
[366:28.79]You're like, wait, we like recorded this.
[366:37.14]It's like three minutes of just like we disconnect.
[366:41.18]I think we all recorded this.
[366:43.87]Classic 2010 YouTube.
[366:45.65]Yeah, you recorded everything.
[366:48.21]You didn't want to miss anything.
[367:04.53]What is this?
[367:16.00]Witcher.
[367:16.52]I was hoping you'd come.
[367:22.04]I don't... Why do I have two ads?
[367:25.10]Double ad?
[367:25.88]I've never seen a double ad.
[367:27.26]Oh, don't worry.
[367:27.72]We can do it.
[367:49.82]What does that look like?
[367:51.84]I'm not watching this video.
[367:52.74]I'm not watching this.
[367:53.32]I'm not gonna watch this video.
[367:57.68]Nothing has changed.
[367:58.64]Yes, it has.
[368:19.20]I'm done.
[368:20.39]I'm not watching this video anymore.
[368:29.57]You can watch it on your own time.
[368:31.83]I'm not watching that video ever again.
[368:46.24]Guys, listen to me, alright?
[368:48.83]I made a thousand videos.
[368:51.13]A thousand of them.
[368:54.07]Okay?
[368:54.67]I don't... Where are... I don't know if you know where we got over here.
[369:05.93]I don't remember.
[369:07.42]We're here.
[369:09.08]Get the janitor up here, please.
[369:13.28]And that's the cam.
[369:14.40]The cam is on.
[369:18.27]Would have been embarrassing if I wasn't ready for you.
[369:22.55]Alright, let's keep going.
[369:27.28]I forgot that was the cam button.
[369:29.82]Alright, so we also had... Oh, it was the person that said they had a macro for WoW.
[369:38.01]Right, okay.
[369:40.87]My face is the same color as this shirt.
[369:47.81]What are you talking about?
[369:53.07]I have orange.
[369:54.25]It's not orange.
[369:55.07]It's like a little tint of red.
[369:58.06]It's hot in here.
[370:00.46]Do you know where I live?
[370:06.42]It's cold.
[370:10.17]Thank you to Sad Vega, though.
[370:13.87]Appreciate it.
[370:17.93]They say, Jerma, I work in IT and I can tell you the FN key is very useful for fixing people who accidentally turn off their Wi-Fi.
[370:28.42]Exactly why it doesn't need to fucking exist.
[370:33.92]Why would you have a function key to turn off your Wi-Fi?
[370:37.94]Just click in the bottom right of your screen and disconnect.
[370:45.32]And alter their screen when they accidentally press the FN key and another key in a combo.
[370:48.68]Yeah, I don't get it.
[370:52.30]You could make every single key 10% larger if half of these keys didn't exist.
[370:58.68]There's so much more key real estate.
[371:01.09]Your enter key could be bigger.
[371:02.27]Your spacebar could be longer and larger.
[371:04.99]Your control could be a bigger key.
[371:08.35]You don't need bigger keys.
[371:09.45]Sometimes you do.
[371:12.39]It's an Apple key on an iPad or whatever.
[371:14.87]Whatever.
[371:18.33]But thank you, Sad Vega.
[371:19.51]Appreciate the insight.
[371:21.97]Dork Cube, thanks for the 250.
[371:23.03]Hey, Jerma, thanks for looking at my dumb Photoshop yesterday and saying WTF.
[371:26.99]Honestly, it made my day.
[371:32.67]Maybe I did.
[371:33.87]I don't remember.
[371:38.56]Yesterday.
[371:40.98]I wasn't even here yesterday.
[371:44.79]Where was I?
[371:52.32]Thank you, Gnarly, for the $2.50.
[371:55.76]Appreciate it.
[371:56.20]I'm having fun with the new jermaSour emote.
[371:58.70]Would it be awesome to have some community BTTV emotes enabled too?
[372:02.22]What's the point of chatting if I can't use Jerma Wild?
[372:07.34]I'm not going to make another 24-hour promise here.
[372:10.78]But...
[372:13.50]Can't you only have five better TV emotes enabled at once?
[372:17.95]Do I have to do something else to enable more than 10 of them or 20 of them or something?
[372:22.11]How do I do that?
[372:28.05]You can enable your own.
[372:29.23]You can have like 20,000.
[372:29.93]It's $5.
[372:30.27]Oh, okay.
[372:33.51]Yeah, I'll take a look.
[372:40.79]into that particular thing that you talking about thank you thank you narcoleptic bear for the thousand bits uh appreciate the ten dollars there for when do you have to wait out the night you should move the lamps away from the windows as the light seeping through the will attract monsters this is essential for surviving nights later in the game
[373:06.78]I have to... Now that I'm in a new space, tomorrow we're going to really start to move around.
[373:10.82]And we're going to do some furniture rearrangement here.
[373:12.46]I think.
[373:23.63]People are... Why are people so strange?
[373:26.33]Anyways.
[373:28.11]Thank you, NarcolepticBear.
[373:29.33]Appreciate it.
[373:29.73]Thank you, DinopulseZeta.
[373:32.69]For the 500 bits, do you think you could eat as much garlic as Wario and be able to fart as much as him if you wanted to?
[373:37.78]I'll tell you.
[373:46.76]Wario is way healthier than Mario.
[373:52.05]Wario eats garlic.
[373:54.91]Mario eats flowers.
[374:03.75]That burn down his esophagus Wario only and mushrooms Mushrooms and hot sauce Wario eats garlic And he's got some weight on him so you know that he's probably eating some beef Wario is a hundred percent muscle
[374:31.64]Shrooms and hot sauce.
[374:32.57]Yeah, that's not a great diet.
[374:35.35]And sometimes cake.
[374:38.83]He eats a ton of candy and sweets, too.
[374:43.53]What does Mario eat?
[374:47.00]Mario eats spicy food, like just hot stuff, like hot sauce.
[374:52.16]Mushrooms.
[374:52.68]But does he eat the mushrooms or do they just disintegrate into his body?
[375:01.20]He eats like bird feathers.
[375:06.90]Cherries, bird feathers.
[375:13.70]Mario doesn't even eat food.
[375:15.70]Why are you at least eats food?
[375:18.08]Candy's not really a technique.
[375:19.80]It is technically a food.
[375:22.39]It's just like sugar, but that's like a food group.
[375:24.91]I mean, no, maybe it's not.
[375:26.13]It's not really food, is it?
[375:30.85]It's a carbohydrate.
[375:32.41]What is food if you break it down to an absolute zero?
[375:35.19]It's just energy.
[375:36.57]Sugar is just energy.
[375:37.97]So it is.
[375:40.43]You can't get energy out of a bird feather.
[375:45.76]Luigi doesn't... can't eat.
[375:47.42]Luigi eats the same stuff as Mario.
[375:53.28]Heat is food.
[375:54.24]Yes.
[375:55.92]When you eat something, it just gets converted into heat in your body and energy.
[376:00.43]And then you burn it.
[376:00.99]Then you have to fill it again.
[376:02.65]It's just like a... You're just a gas tank.
[376:10.35]I mean, that's true.
[376:11.29]Yes.
[376:12.65]I mean, but that's just basic... Basic, just... Raw science.
[376:18.25]I could go into more of that.
[376:19.32]Everything has energy, idiot.
[376:22.16]Oh, yeah?
[376:24.22]So, if I ate...
[376:27.19]If I ate the glass here, I would turn that into energy?
[376:34.16]I would not.
[376:36.06]I would not.
[376:37.98]If I sucked on this piece of plastic right here... I'm not going to get any energy from that.
[376:44.71]I can't turn that into heat.
[376:46.55]Kelvin.
[376:48.99]That's not your name, that's the temperature that you use.
[376:59.04]Yeah, Calvin.
[377:04.42]That's like three or four strange messages in a row.
[377:11.83]But thank you.
[377:12.49]Appreciate it.
[377:13.03]We also had...
[377:28.66]uh Mason carkey thanks for the 250 bits did you remember like a year ago when you were building the birdhouse and put a chain around your neck like a choker I haven't been able to get over it dude it was like so hot okay okay couldn't believe it that's four that's four in a row it's a full moon tonight
[378:01.74]But thank you, appreciate it.
[378:05.82]Also, an anonymous cheerer gave... 1,000 bits, anonymously.
[378:10.38]Just anonymous cheerer, no message or anything.
[378:13.72]Thank you.
[378:15.37]CNLive gave 1,000 bits as well, right after that.
[378:18.19]No message either.
[378:19.49]Balla Koala gave $25 twice.
[378:24.02]And the full moon is out, so obviously they wrote pee-pee, and then they wrote poo-poo with jermaSour before each one of them, $25 each.
[378:36.33]Thank you, Bala Koala, for the 5,000 bits total.
[378:41.47]And your full moon comment.
[378:46.00]Thank you Ear Zephyr for the 1,000 bits.
[378:50.62]Jerma's reactions make scary games seem like comedic romps.
[378:54.62]Also, funny scream.
[379:01.37]Vilemi just gave 5,000 bits right now.
[379:03.39]They say, Jerma, can you wear a collar on stream?
[379:05.47]No reason.
[379:06.03]No.
[379:07.35]I'm not going to wear the collar on stream.
[379:09.88]That's not going to happen.
[379:12.86]ever so just you have to accept that that's not gonna happen the closest you're gonna get is when I put that thing or that little choker thing around that's it that's the only image you're gonna ever have what are these messages I'm telling you I don't know is the we have like a red moon or something we have like a green moon tonight
[379:45.68]But, thank you for the thousand bits.
[379:47.04]Appreciate it.
[379:48.88]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[379:52.94]By the way, I saw people suggesting you play SC6 after you showed my characters on stream.
[379:59.07]I just want to warn you, the character creator is really restrictive and not really worth it when compared to WWE games.
[380:03.47]Plus, I'd have to play Soul Calibur, which I don't want to do.
[380:08.89]I don't have anything against Soul Calibur, I'm just saying I don't really want to play Soul Calibur.
[380:13.47]You don't just make those characters and then just don't do anything.
[380:15.95]You have to play Soul Calibur.
[380:19.67]I'd get frustrated.
[380:20.47]You know what would happen.
[380:21.45]I don't even need to tell you what would happen.
[380:23.06]I would get shit on twice in a row, and it would piss me off more than anything.
[380:28.36]And I would quit the game, and it would just be one of those streams where it was like, oh, he got angry.
[380:33.16]Like, once every two or three years, it would be that stream.
[380:36.70]Do CPU versus CPU.
[380:38.02]No, I'd still get angry.
[380:39.66]Because my guy didn't win.
[380:44.76]But, yeah.
[380:49.28]I didn't really have a plan, but your characters were fucking awesome.
[380:55.37]Thank you for those.
[380:56.77]Hey, Crispin.
[380:57.73]Thank you, Crispin3.
[380:59.11]Day for the 300 bits.
[381:00.57]And they just say, PogChamp, PogChamp, PogChamp.
[381:05.39]Sorry about that.
[381:08.20]And let's get the credits on the screen.
[381:09.92]They're right here.
[381:11.04]I should be ready to do it.
[381:12.32]I'm ready to go.
[381:13.98]Are you?
[381:17.18]Are you ready for this to go?
[381:18.48]See you tomorrow?
[381:23.06]See you tomorrow.
[381:25.24]Right?
[381:26.52]More of this.
[381:28.56]They should pop up there.
[381:29.38]They are.
[381:30.40]Thank you for supporting the stream.
[381:31.27]Anybody that subbed.
[381:31.91]All the community subs.
[381:32.61]Everybody.
[381:32.91]It means a lot.
[381:35.03]Thank you again.
[381:40.55]Have a great night.
[381:41.25]We'll see you tomorrow.
[381:44.71]We had a few more bits that came in right here, though.
[381:46.49]We had White Fox with 500 bits.
[381:51.79]Hey man, just thought I'd chime in.
[381:53.15]Not sure if this helps, but I spent three years not eating onions or garlic for health reasons.
[381:56.97]It is annoying for sure if you ever try and eat out, but some pro tips.
[382:00.83]Sushi and home cooking.
[382:02.63]Use lots of your favorite produce to make up for it.
[382:05.07]Like avocado, tomato, really fresh tasting stuff.
[382:08.69]Hope it all works out.
[382:09.89]I was able to tolerate onions again after a few years off of them, by the way.
[382:12.77]Yeah, my doctor's not sure if that's what it is.
[382:17.75]But I have to do this diet for, like, a while.
[382:19.86]I was supposed to start doing it a while ago, but... Going to do the carnival and then TwitchCon.
[382:27.02]You kind of can't... It was just... It was going to be too hard to start.
[382:30.50]So, I'm doing it now.
[382:31.99]The diet is a low FODMAP diet.
[382:34.81]What's wrong with me?
[382:35.59]No, there's nothing wrong with me.
[382:36.45]I'm okay.
[382:36.69]I'll be fine.
[382:40.75]But... Um, yeah.
[382:43.01]Yeah.
[382:45.63]Thanks for the tips.
[382:47.21]I was making a joke that if I got a bearded dragon, that I'd have to eat a bunch more of good salad, because they eat a shitload of greens and healthy food.
[382:56.83]So I was trying to really sell this to Kim, by the way.
[382:59.24]Hey, let's get a bearded dragon.
[383:01.16]And she's like, uh, I don't know, are you sure about that?
[383:04.12]And I'm like, yeah, well, we're gonna eat more salad.
[383:08.78]Because we're gonna buy a bunch of salad stuff to feed to the bearded dragon, and then we have to eat that salad too, it's making us healthier.
[383:22.47]Did it work?
[383:24.29]I'm not sure yet.
[383:27.24]But I want one.
[383:30.58]Either that or a couple of frogs.
[383:31.84]Either that or like a little gecko or something.
[383:34.24]They're fun, they're cute.
[383:38.57]Plus, for the frogs, there's another thing that I told Kim.
[383:41.25]I was like, Kim, maybe I'll get a couple of tree frogs.
[383:43.25]And she's like, oh, really?
[383:45.61]And I said, don't worry, it's on brand.
[383:53.12]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[383:55.80]Wait, hold on.
[383:56.38]Fickle Pickle just came in with $5.
[383:58.62]500 bits.
[384:02.30]I saw you out, but I was too afraid to talk to you because you were watching the lizards get sprayed.
[384:09.59]Were you at this pet store that I happened to stumble across?
[384:16.47]I literally saw you looking at the lizards.
[384:20.83]No you didn't.
[384:21.33]No way.
[384:22.50]There's no way.
[384:27.66]Holy shit.
[384:34.48]Hey, those lizards are pretty cool.
[384:38.00]He spotted out in the wild.
[384:40.44]At like the lizard store.
[384:46.57]That's fucking crazy.
[384:49.10]You didn't even know... Why didn't you say something?
[384:53.04]You should have been like... Hey, those lizards are real cool, huh?
[384:58.38]Hi, Jerma.
[384:59.04]And I would have been like... Hi?
[385:02.88]How are you?
[385:06.95]That's fucking crazy.
[385:10.71]You need to have a secret code phrase for fans.
[385:14.75]Well, I actually, if you are curious, I've been doing my research and I have been trying to find places in like the Vegas area that has lizards and amphibians.
[385:31.76]So I've been to quite a few places.
[385:35.09]Interestingly enough.
[385:40.15]Kim and I actually went to one yesterday and the day before.
[385:45.73]I don't think anyone would call you Jerma in public except for fans.
[385:48.29]That's what I'm saying.
[385:50.73]Lizard store meetup.
[385:53.97]Why would I ever do that?
[385:55.97]That would be so... That would be so strange.
[386:02.19]But there actually are a couple places.
[386:04.27]Believe it or not.
[386:05.51]Like three or four of them.
[386:08.64]You kind of have to go a ways.
[386:11.32]But there are some great stores.
[386:13.70]That have great, great, great, great selections.
[386:19.54]Can I bring my dragon?
[386:26.79]No, but guys, we're not doing a lizard meetup, okay?
[386:33.87]The secret phrase is pee pants.
[386:35.43]No, just say hi, Jerma.
[386:37.93]So I'll immediately know that what's going on.
[386:42.64]Every, if anybody ever sees me in public and it's, it's happened a few times, it's, it's, it's alright.
[386:49.40]You can come up and say, hi, just be like, Hey, what's up, man?
[386:52.11]Jerma, right?
[386:52.69]And I'll be like, yeah.
[386:54.15]So how, how are you?
[386:55.83]It's happened a few times.
[386:59.95]It's you don't have to, you don't have to hide from me.
[387:09.16]You don't have to prove it's you.
[387:15.12]Now I'm trying to figure out, like, who you were.
[387:18.81]You know what I mean?
[387:19.37]Now I'm trying to figure out who were you there.
[387:23.03]You know what I'm saying?
[387:23.63]I'm just like, hold on, wait a minute.
[387:25.43]I'm scanning my memory.
[387:28.21]Like, where were they?
[387:28.95]Did somebody look at me?
[387:31.01]Did somebody look at me?
[387:32.33]And, like, I made eye contact?
[387:34.23]It may have happened once.
[387:34.93]I don't know.
[387:40.84]I'm trying... That's so weird.
[387:44.28]That's... That's so... That's so interesting.
[387:47.96]Say hi next time.
[387:50.46]Look, I'm going all around to all the lizard stores.
[387:57.49]Is it weird that... Knowing that lost people recognize you and don't show it?
[388:04.27]I mean, I... Not really.
[388:05.85]I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[388:11.93]If I was to go out and somebody was to say something, like, hey, what's up?
[388:14.71]It's just like I would say hello to anybody anyways.
[388:17.29]It's like, oh, hey, how are you?
[388:18.47]Good to see you.
[388:19.65]How's school?
[388:21.07]How's life?
[388:21.74]How are you doing?
[388:22.58]How's your job?
[388:23.46]And then you're like, alright, awesome.
[388:25.52]I'm doing good and tell you a few things about me and...
[388:30.50]Alright, I'll see you later.
[388:31.90]Like, I'll see you later.
[388:33.76]It's not like it's odd.
[388:35.58]You know?
[388:36.08]People have conversations with each other all the time.
[388:38.37]Like, guys, I have conversations with people at, like, the coffee shops.
[388:42.55]You know what I mean?
[388:42.99]Like, somebody will say a sentence, and you're just like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ba-da-ba-doo, yeah, ba-da-ba-doo.
[388:46.55]And they're like, yeah, ba-da-ba-doo.
[388:47.43]And you're like, yeah, ba-da-ba-doo.
[388:49.07]And then you just move on with your day.
[388:50.59]Right?
[388:52.63]It happens all the time.
[389:00.61]Alright.
[389:01.77]See you tomorrow.
[389:02.99]Take care, guys.
[389:04.95]I'll see you tomorrow.
[389:06.69]We actually can go like this now.
[389:10.23]Because it is the end of the stream.
[389:12.11]Take care, everybody.
[389:13.65]Much love to you.
[389:15.29]Have a fantastic rest of your evening.
[389:21.02]Maybe I'll end up with a lizard.
[389:22.98]I don't know.
[389:29.90]I missed bits by crunchy pickles.
[389:32.98]What about a pet snake?
[389:34.97]Um... $4, by the way.
[389:38.33]400 bits.
[389:40.35]I... Here's the thing about snakes.
[389:43.35]Snakes are really, really, really cool.
[389:46.16]They're really, really interesting.
[389:47.90]And they're so cute.
[389:49.60]Like a... Those ball pythons are just adorable.
[389:55.00]I cannot feed a snake a mouse.
[389:57.93]I can't.
[389:59.77]I couldn't do it.
[390:04.20]That's the wall.
[390:11.44]And I know that you can get them frozen, right?
[390:14.22]But that's just... I don't know.
[390:15.38]I can't.
[390:16.04]This is too much for me.
[390:18.28]I could feed a bearded dragon bugs.
[390:21.37]And kale, not kale, like grains and stuff, whatever they eat.
[390:26.97]I have to, you know, obviously still do some research if I'm gonna do it or not.
[390:30.18]I could eat a, I could feed a bearded dragon bugs.
[390:33.70]But not a rat or something, no.
[390:38.70]I would get attached to the mouse.
[390:44.96]But none of this is set in stone, this is all just... I've been sort of looking at a handful of stores in the area, like in the Vegas area.
[390:54.91]So, I've kind of been hopping around like, do they sell things?
[390:57.65]Do they sell things?
[390:58.31]Do they sell things?
[390:58.93]Do they sell things?
[390:59.67]Let's get in the car, let's go!
[391:02.43]So, none of this is really set in stone, I'm just doing research on it now.
[391:06.16]I'm obviously trying to ask the right questions.
[391:12.05]You're attached to a frozen mouse.
[391:15.67]No, you know what I'm saying though.
[391:17.41]It's not that simple.
[391:28.44]If you do it, you have to get a lizard cam.
[391:33.40]Can't bearded dragons just hang out and just sit on your shoulder?
[391:43.19]Aren't they just super chill?
[391:46.85]But they'll poop on you.
[391:49.18]It's alright, whatever.
[391:53.42]Yeah, the humidity control, I've been doing a lot of research.
[392:01.47]They just sit around and act dumb.
[392:07.29]I don't know.
[392:08.05]It's up there in the brain.
[392:09.15]I'm gonna have to... This is a multi-month decision process, by the way.
[392:14.40]Like, I'm not gonna turn the stream on tomorrow and there's gonna be a bearded dragon on stream.
[392:18.30]Like, no.
[392:18.70]This is like a multi... It's gonna take, like, months to figure this out.
[392:26.80]But... See you guys tomorrow for more Darkwood.
[392:30.21]Take care.
[392:30.51]See you soon.
[392:34.23]Have a great rest of your night.
[392:34.97]And goodbye.
[392:45.82]you
[393:16.32]Thank you.
