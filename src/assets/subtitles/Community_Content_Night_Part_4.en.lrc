[00:19.60]Screen camera's gotta sit.
[00:24.16]I'm a human being, okay?
[00:31.61]I'm just a fucking emote.
[00:47.15]How did I even do this?
[00:49.67]It's stretched out.
[01:00.82]It is a little stretched out.
[01:08.68]Right there, right?
[01:14.11]Right there?
[01:16.13]That works.
[01:17.96]Okay.
[01:18.12]You look like fucking Adam Driver.
[01:21.62]Yeah, well, he's a handsome guy, so do you think I give a shit?
[01:25.10]That's like a handsome, that's a handsome guy.
[01:30.27]Alright.

[01:34.55]Hold on.
[01:34.91]Get off.
[01:35.29]I don't want to be on camera.
[01:36.07]I'm never going on camera again.
[01:38.11]Let me change the, uh, title.
[01:41.27]To...

[02:13.57]Okay, and oh, and now you're going to tell me, and Brad Pitt is fucking ugly too, apparently, huh?
[02:22.20]You know, I could have an opinion about somebody that's completely an unpopular opinion.
[02:31.32]Except I actually, I do think that Brad Pitt is very handsome.
[02:38.10]Community...
[02:41.51]content uh snippets because it's not going to be as long community content snippets the bad name community content snacks oh that doesn't make any sense community con just community content night whatever who cares
[03:12.52]That's what we're doing.
[03:18.39]So as you see, we're in the art section.
[03:21.99]Art.
[03:24.51]There is a ton of art.
[03:29.43]Art is actually one of the things that is the most submitted.
[03:34.77]That's why we have so many talented artists here that put up a ton of awesome shit.
[03:42.03]There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of art submissions.
[03:46.41]There's a lot.
[03:47.67]You guys do a lot of this shit, and it's great.
[03:52.27]I'm back.
[03:52.65]Alright, we got a giant rat.
[03:55.93]No watermark, though.
[03:56.69]I don't know whoever it was.
[03:57.79]I'm too big.
[03:59.05]I'm, like, huge.
[03:59.59]Alright, that's better.
[04:03.29]Put on some music.
[04:08.16]Yeah.
[04:10.63]What we got?
[04:11.49]We have Skype hang-up sound.
[04:13.59]That's not really a good OST.
[04:14.95]Skype OST.
[04:19.75]Oh, yeah.
[04:20.21]Let's take a break.
[04:20.91]Right.
[04:21.09]We can take a pee break.
[04:22.64]Right.
[04:22.86]That's probably good.
[04:23.44]Yeah.
[04:23.66]I have to go to the bathroom.
[04:24.64]You're right.
[04:26.04]I'll get some songs.
[04:26.94]We'll go take a piss break.
[04:27.86]Be right back.
[07:04.66]Hi guys.
[07:09.63]Alright, what should we do for music?
[07:12.95]How about... Something chill.
[07:16.99]Not Doom, not Doom, not Doom.
[07:22.46]Do I like okra?
[07:23.98]A vegetable?
[07:25.56]Fried okra is awesome, yeah.
[07:29.06]Odd question, but yeah.
[07:34.24]Uh, Animal Crossing, yeah, that's a good one.
[07:40.04]Which one, though?
[07:41.31]Three hours of relaxing and beautiful Animal Crossing music.
[07:46.43]Aw, look at that.
[07:49.53]When's a new one coming out?
[07:50.39]Isn't there one coming out for Switch?
[07:52.83]Eventually?
[07:58.31]In March?
[07:58.89]Holy shit, really?
[08:01.27]Damn.
[08:02.92]Alright, let's do some artwork.
[08:06.28]So we have a giant rat we saw for a little bit.
[08:09.40]Thank you, whoever this was.
[08:11.15]Good shit.
[08:13.37]We have me as the king.
[08:15.95]LOL, Boomer King.
[08:21.75]Thanks for the watermark.
[08:23.76]This is really well done.
[08:24.60]Okay, we both rule.
[08:28.12]We both rule together.
[08:30.22]It's important.
[08:34.12]Boomer King.
[08:34.84]What's Boomer King?
[08:36.36]I don't get it.
[08:42.70]Me.
[08:43.08]Yeah, but I don't get it.
[08:44.25]What is a Boomer King?
[08:45.83]Am I the king of all old people?
[08:47.25]I don't understand.
[08:51.69]It's a restaurant.
[08:55.15]Oh, okay.
[08:55.59]I get it.
[08:55.89]I mean, I still don't.
[08:58.36]I'm 34.
[08:59.90]I still am trying to catch on to that.
[09:06.43]If you don't get it, then that means you're a boomer.
[09:08.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:08.85]This is awesome.
[09:09.73]Thank you.
[09:11.39]Good shit.
[09:14.01]This one's wild.
[09:16.05]This one is fireman here.
[09:19.65]I like this down here.
[09:22.62]Hey!
[09:28.66]One of my seven shirts I wear.
[09:33.18]Cute little fireman in the middle.
[09:39.22]You're going to be flashed.
[09:40.98]Not in that way that you're thinking.
[09:46.92]You got the teeth right.
[09:48.73]Got the teeth right.
[09:53.53]I love it.
[09:55.89]SCP-985.
[09:59.17]Very toothy.
[10:01.13]He's a very toothy guy.
[10:05.10]Rat down here too.
[10:06.00]That's cool.
[10:07.78]Is there a watermark that I'm missing?
[10:09.67]Ooh, this is fucking high fidelity.
[10:14.35]Oh, right here.
[10:14.87]There it is.
[10:16.83]Good shit.
[10:19.23]This one's really cute.
[10:19.99]Yeah.
[10:21.14]It is.
[10:21.36]This one, on the other hand, referencing Jump King, but I don't
[10:37.80]I'm never gonna get this shit.
[10:39.80]I'm never gonna understand what this is.
[10:43.66]This is horrible.
[10:50.14]Fuck the king, FTK!
[10:51.57]That's coming back fairly soon, by the way.
[10:55.18]We have some new rules implemented, and the new FTK server is gonna be... It's not ready yet, but we took all that data from the last mess of a stream with the thousands of people connecting, and we got it down for real.
[11:12.50]There's gonna be a lot of fun stuff to do on that server.
[11:15.44]Soon.
[11:17.60]Soon, soon, soon.
[11:19.71]Fuck the king.
[11:22.35]But this is a pretty good depiction of what happened on that stream.
[11:27.70]Chat was just freaking the fuck out because nobody could do anything and nobody could eat.
[11:31.22]And I was just killing people.
[11:35.18]Surrounded by mods and devs that can fly around.
[11:41.30]So yeah, we took the criticism, don't worry.
[11:44.34]We're implementing a lot of changes.
[11:47.34]It's a Spongebob movie.
[11:52.52]This is great.
[11:56.43]FTK will be coming back soon.
[11:58.33]Soon, soon, soon.
[12:01.43]Oh, right.
[12:01.91]We have... We have... These are the new Soul Calibur 6 created characters.
[12:09.03]Let's actually get close for this.
[12:14.38]Let's go over here.
[12:15.52]Can I not move down over here?
[12:19.82]Come on.
[12:22.11]Oh, I can just do that.
[12:23.41]So these are new Soul Calibur characters.
[12:26.53]Here's, uh, by the Resident Soul Calibur 6 character creator.
[12:31.05]Dick Dastardly Richard.
[12:34.27]This is good.
[12:34.95]Uh, here's Bugleberry.
[12:38.73]Everybody's favorite character.
[12:42.36]Some of these are really fucking good, by the way.
[12:44.88]Look at this one.
[12:45.46]This is the J. The J. Janitor.
[12:51.80]I don't even know how you do this.
[12:55.82]It's perfect, though.
[13:01.80]There's Dr. Schmikeson.
[13:03.16]A good doctor.
[13:05.31]Is this music not loud enough?
[13:08.21]You guys know?
[13:10.93]Oh, there you go.
[13:13.93]It's Ivy.
[13:16.77]Look at this one.
[13:17.49]This is Jupiter.
[13:22.70]This one's scary because it's the same idea with making characters in the wrestling games.
[13:30.75]You just have to make this gigantic torso human.
[13:35.71]And it's scary.
[13:38.95]Here's King Jerma from the FTK stream.
[13:43.10]Pretty accurate.
[13:46.35]I don't know who any of these fighters are, but still.
[13:50.37]Here's the Joker.
[13:51.05]Or the Jerma Joker.
[13:56.44]Everybody always makes me the Joker.
[13:57.98]I don't get it.
[13:58.50]I told you, I'm more of a Riddler than I am Joker.
[14:01.80]Make me as the Riddler and stuff.
[14:03.14]That's like what I want.
[14:04.04]That's what I like.
[14:06.28]Oh, there's Grillmaster.
[14:07.36]Why is he huge?
[14:10.96]Why is he like seven feet tall?
[14:15.31]He's stacked.
[14:16.31]That's not accurate.
[14:17.76]There's Grady Grinner.
[14:23.34]He's got those barbecue shoes on.
[14:27.86]Huge Santa.
[14:32.40]Jermario?
[14:33.61]What is Jermario?
[14:40.39]Just me, but Mario.
[14:44.54]Dr. Jermario?
[14:46.40]Why?
[14:47.08]What?
[14:49.72]Oh, it's the mustache hair.
[14:50.92]Okay, I get it.
[14:56.26]I didn't know what this was until right now.
[14:59.72]This character is, wait, what?
[15:03.83]The sub sound from the Hearthstone cart.
[15:12.77]Holy shit, that's a reference.
[15:17.20]It's Monk... MonkaS.
[15:25.16]Oh, here's the wine guy.
[15:26.34]Here's the trine wizard.
[15:34.20]Trine wizard?
[15:35.28]He killed my... What is this?
[15:40.49]Character name, he killed my what?
[15:49.00]He killed my mom.
[15:51.54]My father was fairly well.
[15:53.13]Oh, that!
[15:53.59]Right.
[15:54.59]Here's Parappa the Rapper.
[15:58.55]This one's awesome.
[16:01.03]You gotta take this in and, like, fight with Parappa.
[16:03.45]People would be so, like, impressed by this one.
[16:08.49]Here's Geno.
[16:09.59]How the fuck?
[16:17.08]How in the name of God...
[16:19.71]Look, he's in Soul Calibur!
[16:21.27]Look, he finally got to do something.
[16:24.98]Instead of collect dust in a box at Square Enix.
[16:35.70]Frank West.
[16:37.46]Holy shit, here's the dentist.
[16:40.34]Here's the Outer Worlds dentist.
[16:43.80]That's so... It's surprising every time we get a batch of these because...
[16:51.22]I wish you could have like 10 people fight at the same time in Soul Calibur.
[16:54.34]We would just do a rumble there somehow.
[16:57.51]But you can't.
[16:59.65]There's the Jump King.
[17:02.21]This is awesome.
[17:03.43]Perfect.
[17:05.75]And he's got the boots.
[17:06.65]He's got the boots on.
[17:09.49]Soul Calibur rumble.
[17:12.64]Character name.
[17:13.86]Brian Johnson.
[17:18.84]Wait.
[17:20.44]Is that...
[17:23.16]That's the lead singer from ACDC.
[17:27.81]And here's me!
[17:38.67]Gnarly62.
[17:39.45]Hope you enjoyed the third batch.
[17:41.55]This may be the final batch because 100 character slots is not enough, I guess.
[17:46.14]This community's wonderful.
[17:47.04]They cook up some seriously amazing stuff.
[17:48.56]Have a great community content night!
[17:51.58]Well, thank you, Gnarly, again.
[17:54.36]You make some great characters.
[17:55.66]These are great.
[17:58.30]Even if we don't get another one.
[18:00.06]You've done three batches of very, very accurate, detailed character stuff.
[18:04.76]So, thank you.
[18:06.46]You're awesome.
[18:09.28]Let's get this back to normal.
[18:10.98]Keep going.
[18:14.90]Scary.
[18:16.65]Pretty scary stuff.
[18:22.85]Jermig Vreed.
[18:25.65]money machine Jerma yep looking good the duality of of Jerma maybe reed changes a man this one is uh the blockbuster 1995 store champion that's me I actually own that I've shown it on stream before that is a legitimate document
[18:55.62]The ornaments on the tree.
[18:59.42]For... for Grillmaster?
[19:03.82]There's Grandpa peering in.
[19:07.29]That's a very... that's one of those videos that's on my main channel from like almost a decade ago now.
[19:12.95]That I don't think very many of you guys have watched.
[19:16.15]There's a full Grandpa poetry animation on that main channel for Christmas.
[19:24.43]I think a lot of people may have missed that one.
[19:28.51]Main channel.
[19:31.22]Archive channel.
[19:32.40]There you go.
[19:33.38]I fixed it.
[19:33.92]This is good stuff, though.
[19:36.66]Down here.
[19:38.54]You can't see because I'm in the way.
[19:40.86]Let's fix that.
[19:41.56]Can you see now?
[19:48.19]No, you can't.
[19:49.25]Can you see it now?
[19:50.01]There you go.
[19:54.85]Thanks a lot for the image.
[19:56.55]Very, very good work.
[19:58.23]As always.
[19:58.63]Keep moving.
[20:03.00]The Incredible Frogmen live for one night only in Viva Las Vegas.
[20:08.24]Presto Majesto.
[20:12.56]7 p.m.
[20:14.16]Friday.
[20:17.24]Wait, isn't today Friday?
[20:18.67]I don't even know what date is.
[20:21.31]No, it's Sunday.
[20:24.72]Do you mean live?
[20:25.80]Oh, live for one.
[20:27.18]No, live for one night only.
[20:30.06]Live for one night only.
[20:33.12]Let's correct that record there.
[20:36.06]This is cute, though.
[20:39.50]Good shit.
[20:42.36]Flip it.
[20:45.82]Oh, yeah, this is cool.
[20:46.73]We have some cookies.
[20:48.89]This is cookie number one.
[20:51.03]And then here's cookie number two.
[20:56.69]Here they are.
[21:01.71]You know how hard it is to make cookies that are custom?
[21:06.75]It's actually hard to do.
[21:09.93]It's such a pain in the ass.
[21:13.09]There's real human teeth on this?
[21:15.41]I didn't even see that.
[21:18.31]Looks like... No, those are cranberry crunchies.
[21:22.89]What are they called?
[21:25.77]Candy Cane Crunchies.
[21:28.40]This is good, though.
[21:29.04]Thank you for these.
[21:32.76]Oh, this is Thunder.
[21:35.36]I don't know who I'm supposed to be here, but I'm crying.
[21:41.74]Cranberry Crunchies Pog.
[21:44.58]Pog?
[21:46.34]Pog?
[21:46.76]I don't know.
[21:47.16]Should I be Pog into that?
[21:48.61]Is this a legitimate?
[21:50.31]I don't know.
[21:51.23]Let me see what you guys think.
[21:53.98]Enable pog.
[21:54.74]No.
[21:56.04]I like seeing it spelled out.
[21:57.28]I don't like seeing... I want to see it spelled out.
[22:00.62]To me, it's spelled out.
[22:02.12]It's not Onimo.
[22:03.36]It's just you saying it.
[22:04.12]Uh, thunder.
[22:08.88]I'm fine, guys.
[22:09.70]I was.
[22:10.12]I was fine.
[22:11.86]We got a gif of the planets.
[22:14.51]Which looks good.
[22:21.63]You know what?
[22:23.58]Earth still has a hat on.
[22:24.74]Am I ever going to take the hat off?
[22:33.61]This is really good, Delio.
[22:37.69]I wonder if I should ever take the hat off.
[22:40.45]No, please, you better not.
[22:41.91]He went on vacation three years ago, and he's still wearing his vacation hat.
[22:49.33]You know what?
[22:50.39]I got into this idea that my emotes were going to be sentient things that did stuff.
[22:57.09]And every six months or so they would all change because they all did something.
[23:01.01]And then I did it once with Earth and never did it ever again and he never took it off.
[23:07.64]Like the sun would go somewhere cold and it would get like chilly or something.
[23:12.14]I don't know.
[23:13.28]And then I got lazy and never did it ever again.
[23:16.95]But at least one of them did something fun.
[23:21.71]This is during the Jump King stream.
[23:22.95]This is supposed to be you guys, I don't know, comforting me.
[23:26.31]That was a hard game.
[23:30.45]Earth had a really good time.
[23:31.69]I love it's on this old ass TV too.
[23:48.44]Put a scarf on Venus.
[23:55.80]Look at this dude!
[23:56.52]Let's get up close.
[23:58.70]Jerma.
[23:59.18]Etalyx Kim Otto.
[24:03.27]Everybody loves Fireman.
[24:06.13]Fireman is just... It's just everything.
[24:08.89]It's just the energy that Fireman gives off.
[24:13.79]It's just how I want to live every day.
[24:15.64]You know what I mean?
[24:21.54]Oh no, pee-pee.
[24:24.41]Metallix and Otto don't have a pee-pee.
[24:26.97]What?
[24:31.70]Call Dawn.
[24:34.00]Pee-pee like the fucking mana, I know.
[24:37.76]Nancy Drew.
[24:38.64]Drew Crew, where you at?
[24:39.88]I know you're in here somewhere.
[24:41.76]No, no, no, don't worry.
[24:42.54]I don't have to say that.
[24:43.36]They'll make themselves known very quickly.
[24:45.81]I don't have to... Do I really have to say anything?
[24:51.47]Hey, how can you tell if somebody's in the Drew Crew?
[24:54.68]Oh, don't worry.
[24:55.24]They'll tell you.
[25:03.92]That was long and loud.
[25:06.97]There are dozens of us.
[25:15.87]All 30 of them.
[25:22.22]This is funny, though.
[25:22.92]Thank you.
[25:24.22]We got this boomer.
[25:25.52]Let us handle it.
[25:26.84]Twitch plays Jerma.
[25:34.92]I thought these were sweat stains for a second.
[25:36.76]I was like, yep.
[25:42.37]Wait, they are.
[25:43.93]Oh, they are.
[25:44.43]They are.
[25:45.63]They are actually.
[25:46.65]It's sweat.
[25:47.79]It's just these gross sweaty stains.
[25:49.49]Alright, cool.
[25:51.87]Nice work.
[25:53.77]That's very clever.
[25:56.91]False start.
[25:59.05]Look at this dude.
[26:03.46]We're gross.
[26:06.28]You belong to us, old man.
[26:12.24]Happy New Year 2020.
[26:12.94]This guy's fucked.
[26:16.13]There's the one guy having some drinks.
[26:17.93]That's good.
[26:18.33]That's alright.
[26:18.75]Just don't go too far.
[26:20.37]Don't drink too much.
[26:22.25]During the legal age of alcohol, uh, able to be bide in your county, then you legally have of age to do it, then have some, don't have too much and just be safe and take care of yourself.
[26:31.88]That's it.
[26:32.16]How old is one guy? 30?
[26:51.95]We have to show, we showed these on stream already.
[26:53.57]What was that?
[26:54.51]We showed these already on stream.
[26:58.57]They're so, they're too good to not, to just have up for like a minute.
[27:03.48]And there are a few of these.
[27:12.54]I love these so much.
[27:13.54]They're so fucking stupid.
[27:23.63]This one actually is scary because they didn't- they didn't do any doctoring.
[27:28.87]They just kind of covered it.
[27:30.97]It looked like a parrot.
[27:32.67]It looked like a parakeet.
[27:33.75]It looked like a fucking bird.
[27:43.54]Silent Hill.
[27:48.50]There's Dr. Schmeichsen.
[27:50.00]I think we've shown this already, but it was good enough to show again.
[27:53.16]This was edited.
[27:54.52]I mean, it was.
[27:55.16]That's such a great image.
[27:58.50]That, like... What a great guy.
[28:04.86]Everybody loves the doc.
[28:06.63]Dr. Schmeichsen.
[28:09.63]What about clown lady fan art?
[28:12.37]Excuse me.
[28:12.97]Uh, you mean Miss Polly Polite?
[28:18.08]Doesn't sound like you're a real fan.
[28:28.09]Happy birthday!
[28:28.97]To whoever's birthday it is.
[28:32.41]This is really cute.
[28:33.09]I like this.
[28:40.62]What kind of cake is that, though?
[28:42.06]I wonder.
[28:48.82]I love this one.
[28:50.00]I love it.
[28:50.92]I just love the teeth.
[28:52.32]The little, like, the little teeth sticking out.
[28:55.94]It's adorable.
[28:56.92]I love it.
[28:58.86]Fuck you, Joel?
[29:00.30]Uh, yeah, this is one I was gonna leave without paying.
[29:04.76]Uh, fuck you, Joel, again.
[29:05.82]Hope you have enough money, LOL.
[29:08.79]This looks like a movie poster for a Zoomer horror movie.
[29:20.64]The Great Canadian FK Club, 20 community subs.
[29:24.62]20 community subs.
[29:25.80]You gave six earlier, too.
[29:26.76]26 community subs, Canadian.
[29:29.20]That's a lot of money.
[29:30.05]Thank you.
[29:32.81]20 community subs from fucking Great Canadian.
[29:36.63]Thanks a lot, man.
[29:41.40]But yeah, this would be like a movie called, like, Don't Download This or something, right?
[29:47.00]Where I get, like, infected through, like, a virus in my computer and I turn into a murderer or something.
[29:50.42]I don't know.

[31:26.25]This is not real.
[31:28.34]There's like a lore with it.
[31:29.64]I don't know.
[31:30.90]I can't tell from the pixelization.
[31:32.66]Hold on.

[32:02.71]They, like, look at this.

[34:17.52]No, that's not part of the deal.
[34:18.76]If you get a wink, you get a wink.
[34:20.36]It doesn't say full screen wink.

[34:54.25]Is it the smile that does it?
[34:56.55]Is it my, like... It has to be, right?
[35:00.57]See, people paint my hair green and do the makeup on me because I go like this.
[35:03.75]And I've got a fucking long-ass chin.
[35:07.96]I get it.
[35:08.30]I get it.
[35:10.14]I'm the Riddler, though.
[35:11.06]I'm not the Joker.
[35:12.16]I'm the Riddler.
[35:14.17]No, I'm not going to say that.
[35:16.46]I was going to say it was a combination of the penguin and the Riddler.
[35:19.98]I don't want to say those words together.
[35:21.30]I don't know.
[35:28.36]Danny DeVito is fucking crazy.
[35:31.24]Too late.
[35:42.25]This is...
[35:44.13]Scary.
[35:45.39]That's a scary image.
[35:46.71]Otto!
[35:49.45]We've shown this image before, but it's so nice.
[35:51.93]He's so... Look at how cute he is.
[35:55.57]Wearing his little jacket, too.
[36:01.48]He has this jacket.
[36:08.08]This is exactly what he looks like.
[36:12.91]Uh, the lovely, classic, sensible, haircut Jerma.
[36:17.22]Whatever this is versus whatever this is.
[36:19.32]Guys aren't that fucking close together, okay?
[36:30.51]Like, my nose might be that big, but I'm not... This is like the kind of shit, like, I get, okay.
[36:41.09]This is like a... I opened up like... This is a caricature artist did this.
[36:45.59]And I feel like I'm like... I'm some like a politician or something.
[36:48.71]You know what I mean?
[36:50.01]Like I'm like... This is like a politician caricature.
[36:57.87]That's like...
[37:23.99]I got fucking more hair than that.
[37:27.55]I got more hair than that.
[37:29.23]I got more hair than that.
[37:31.99]That's funny though.
[37:32.75]That's actually pretty good work too.
[37:34.83]Who is this supposed to be?
[37:35.69]Is this supposed to be me?
[37:41.05]No, I'll tell you what this is.
[37:43.74]The lovely, classic, sensible 26-year-old Jeremy versus what happens when you get to 35.
[37:51.88]There's aging.
[37:55.76]People get older and they look a little different.
[38:02.15]You get older and things change.
[38:11.22]35.
[38:11.36]Yeah, I... You guys already know this shit.
[38:14.30]Do I have to say this out loud over and over?
[38:16.14]I'm turning 35 this year.
[38:19.27]That sucks.
[38:19.97]35.
[38:21.77]That's so... I'm like 100.
[38:24.31]I'm not... If you think I'm turning 35, you're fucking crazy.
[38:34.60]Uh...
[38:40.59]This is Jerma Noir and I'm being haunted apparently from my old self.
[38:52.78]I fucking hate this image.
[38:55.20]I hate this image so much.
[38:56.58]Oh, I hate it.
[39:01.78]It's like the worst image ever.
[39:10.73]It just, like, it just looks so bad and shitty.
[39:13.48]Not even, like, funny shitty.
[39:14.80]It just looks bad.
[39:16.18]Is sour please broken for anybody else?
[39:19.86]Let's find out.
[39:25.76]Oh, it works.
[39:31.57]Thank you, Jerma.
[39:34.55]Friend when I feel alone.
[39:37.56]Knowing that he cares makes me happy.
[39:40.28]I fucking thank you.
[39:44.39]This is very sweet.
[39:47.21]He's farming Sour Please.
[39:51.45]How do you farm Sour Please?
[39:52.65]Just put any song on.
[39:55.09]You'll get it forever.
[40:01.96]He's no friend of mine!
[40:12.59]No, no, I'm talking about that person that- No, no.
[40:15.87]No.
[40:16.55]I'm talking about the person that just said that.
[40:19.45]I'm not your friend now?
[40:21.72]Well, you're not invited to my fucking birthday party.
[40:23.56]There's gonna be 50,000 people there.
[40:30.26]I love the sleepy rat.
[40:33.29]Relationship with Jerma over.
[40:36.85]Now, who the fuck is your new best friend?
[40:39.27]Who?
[40:40.75]You gotta finish that.
[40:41.51]You can't just say the first part.
[40:42.69]Who?
[40:45.14]Joel?
[40:47.76]Okay.
[40:51.46]This is really nice, though.
[40:52.22]Experiment in 50 years.
[40:59.86]That doesn't even look that bad.
[41:08.68]If I look like this when I'm 60, am I really going to care?
[41:12.18]That looks okay.
[41:14.64]That's fine.
[41:16.98]Nice eye.
[41:21.01]This is not a real image.
[41:22.49]Oh, wow, dude.
[41:24.89]Look at your eye.
[41:25.47]Your eye looks fucking fucked up.
[41:28.31]Yeah, this is not a real image.
[41:29.47]Are we dead?
[41:30.85]What happened?
[41:33.27]What happened?
[41:38.28]No, we're good.
[41:39.88]We're good.
[41:40.32]Just hang tight.
[41:44.36]2020, year of the rat.
[41:44.90]That's true.
[41:46.26]Actually is year of the rat.
[41:52.50]A lot of them.
[41:55.50]I like the eyes on this one.
[41:57.61]They're very sheeny, shiny.
[42:02.15]Looks really good.
[42:06.69]We better get a new rat emote this year.
[42:08.50]I mean, you kind of have to.
[42:11.76]Eventually.
[42:12.34]Whenever I decide to do it.
[42:16.18]Hopefully soon.
[42:18.16]I'd put this on the wall.
[42:20.02]I gotta have some cool shit on the wall, don't I?
[42:22.13]I gotta make like a streamer room, don't I?
[42:27.77]Right?
[42:28.49]I gotta have a streamer room.
[42:33.70]Yeah, I want a blue light, and a pink light, and a red light.
[42:39.48]And that's how you can tell it's a streamer room.
[42:43.88]I need like a blue light back here.
[42:50.09]Streamer cave, yeah.
[42:55.43]That actually would hurt my head.
[42:57.72]You know, I see a lot of people have lights.
[43:01.19]Like, bright, orange, purple, pink lights back here.
[43:05.47]Like, in their room.
[43:06.33]I feel like it'd be like... It would hurt me.
[43:09.62]It would be like UV rays to my head.
[43:11.94]I wouldn't want to do that.
[43:16.10]What is this?
[43:16.44]Did you run it too fast?
[43:23.91]I can't clear it.
[43:28.38]This is actually pretty funny.
[43:32.30]This is pretty funny.
[43:34.06]Yeah, this is funny.
[43:35.36]It's funny.
[43:36.61]Okay, I will allow this one.
[43:40.33]I allow this one.
[43:48.40]It's like... It could be real.
[43:50.30]It's...
[44:05.47]I feel like this is the type of image that you actually have when you go so overboard and you're trying so hard to, like, have a good Tinder profile picture that it ends up looking like this because you've taken a hundred fucking pictures.
[44:21.34]And finally you get this one, you're like, you've seen the same image of you trying to do a good picture a thousand times.
[44:28.79]And it's like, I guess it's that one.
[44:32.99]And then people scroll through this and they're like, holy shit, like, why?
[44:43.97]Why is Jerma using Tinder?
[44:45.09]I used to use Tinder.
[44:48.13]I used to use Tinder before Kim.
[44:50.29]You guys knew that.
[44:50.91]I used to talk about it all the time.
[44:52.22]I used to talk about, like, all the fucked up shit that happened.
[44:56.08]You guys don't remember that?
[44:59.74]The old viewers do.
[45:02.99]That's how he met Kim.
[45:04.13]I did not meet Kim on Tinder.
[45:05.45]That's not what happened.
[45:08.11]No.
[45:08.71]I don't have like a story like, oh, I super liked her and then she super liked me back.
[45:14.91]No.
[45:18.83]Rats.
[45:19.23]We're rats.
[45:19.83]We're the rats.
[45:20.57]We pray at night.
[45:21.21]We stalk at night.
[45:21.81]We're the rats.
[45:23.21]I'm the giant rat who makes all the rules.
[45:24.93]These are not even rats.
[45:26.29]These are dogs or something.
[45:27.47]What is this?
[45:31.31]What the fuck is this?
[45:35.05]These are dogs.
[45:38.25]Although I do like this one so much.
[45:41.26]Why can't this animal exist?
[45:43.32]I want one.
[45:44.40]Don't you want one of these?
[45:53.26]I want one of those.
[45:56.34]It's a doge.
[45:57.20]I know what it is, but that's not a doge.
[46:00.24]This is a rat dog gerbil thing.
[46:07.57]The wizard in the boulder.
[46:08.61]What's on the ATM?
[46:10.23]It's me, the wizard.
[46:11.19]I telepathically downloaded my soul into this ATM from AI dungeon.
[46:17.78]Otto is literally a rat dog.
[46:19.24]Yes, I know.
[46:19.66]He's a rat terrier.
[46:21.28]Dachshund.
[46:22.18]We've confirmed that with genetic DNA.
[46:29.55]This is good shit, though.
[46:30.31]Thank you.
[46:32.43]Oh, the banana milk in the bag.
[46:37.49]What is this?
[46:40.67]What is this?
[46:46.92]Oh, I thought this was liquid.
[46:48.10]I thought this was, like, Gatorade.
[46:50.62]Oh, that's the bread.
[46:51.30]That's the bread.
[46:51.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:52.64]You always gotta bring enough bread and cheese and oatmeal and shit.
[47:10.74]Ah, this is another picture that I, like, wish I could delete.
[47:14.70]It's just fucking scary.
[47:20.71]You look like you've encouraged the cowardly dog.
[47:24.75]Was this your Tinder pic?
[47:26.97]No, it wasn't.
[47:29.07]No?
[47:29.27]Okay, I just, like, laugh internally a little bit, and, like, my chest just kind of popped.
[47:40.83]Imagine this was your profile picture on Tinder.
[47:44.77]You'd get reported.
[47:45.89]Hey, look at that!
[47:48.74]Okay, add a 5, and then add a 1, and then add another 1.
[47:53.76]Then you'd be correct.
[47:56.16]Add a 5, turn this into a 5, and then make this, turn this into an 8.
[47:59.48]Done.
[48:02.30]I know you're basing that on that one image at that height thing, and it was a joke.
[48:07.22]Come on, you guys can't take a joke.
[48:14.95]Four, five, four, what, six, and then five, eight.
[48:19.71]Got five, whatever.
[48:24.27]Good shit.
[48:25.55]Say the line.
[48:26.27]What line?
[48:26.79]What do you mean the line?
[48:29.91]Got the coffee right, though.
[48:35.76]I love coffee.
[48:37.24]I'm a big coffee fan.
[48:40.38]I get it from my mother.
[48:42.95]My mother drinks coffee a lot, and I drink coffee a lot now, too.
[48:49.86]Chicken.
[48:51.26]I actually did buy chicken, and I bought Cheetos.
[48:54.62]Yes, say the line.
[48:56.10]Say the line.
[48:56.70]Say the line.
[48:57.74]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken, everybody.
[49:01.74]This is from Peaceful Haley.
[49:03.26]I was during the FTK stream.
[49:05.34]How did you get it up there?
[49:06.76]How did you even do this?
[49:08.72]How did you get that up there?
[49:12.92]Wait, did you build this and then jump off?
[49:19.37]Afterwards.
[49:20.03]Oh.
[49:22.61]This is like the crowning achievement and then it was like, I gotta get down.
[49:27.97]Scaffolding?
[49:28.51]There's no scaffolding though.

[78:45.25]Don't they have a thing where you can touch the thing and it transparently comes out as chat?
[78:48.77]But I guess that's kind of annoying.

[78:53.44]I can imagine if I'm at the gym or if I'm on the toilet.
[78:55.76]Yeah.

[81:00.78]There's an entire article written about this.
[81:02.72]Hold on a second.
[81:15.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:17.16]I want to read this.
[81:17.78]I want to read this.
[81:29.10]Okay.
[81:31.62]Let's read this.
[81:33.32]Let's read this article.
[81:37.75]Okay, here we go.
[81:38.45]So this says...
[81:43.97]I don't get it.
[81:44.35]OH MY GOD
[82:10.37]Wait, did I just?
[82:12.01]This is the ad.
[82:13.81]This is an ad.
[82:15.63]Okay.
[82:18.24]Alright.
[82:18.60]Jerma is a popular variety streamer that covers just about any category of game and occasionally dips into IRL in real life content.
[82:26.16]He was streaming a personal best and worst of 2019 on New Year's Eve when one moment left him retreating into his chair and then hilariously tumbling into the floor.
[82:35.45]Why this image?
[82:39.68]This is like the Jeremy, like, loves money image.
[82:43.18]Jeremy is a variety Twitch streamer known for his entertaining guy.
[82:45.68]That's a nice thing to say.
[82:48.07]The American.
[82:50.35]The American.
[82:52.99]I just reached the worst sound of 2009.
[82:55.13]Am I getting... This is a real article.
[82:58.11]I didn't get, like, fucking edited and somebody fucked me up and gave me a fake website, right?
[83:17.11]Why did it go over here?
[83:18.95]Why did it go over here?
[83:21.95]They want me to watch this video so bad.
[83:25.81]Why did it go over here?
[83:26.55]Alright, the American just reached the worst sound of 2019 category and was not enjoying the winner, which was the popular anime Ayaya Song, something he claims he apologized about for over an hour.
[83:43.05]Jeremy tried to get as far away from the song as possible, sinking into his chair.
[83:46.57]However, he quickly realized he'd gone a little too far as the chair slid away from him and he hilariously tumbled to the floor.
[83:52.83]Oh shit, he screamed, which was followed by a loud thud and a short silence as he picked himself up off the floor.
[84:08.38]Mute it.
[84:14.35]Okay.
[84:15.71]Jerma tried to be cool about it and play it off as a real-life fall joke.
[84:20.88]But his chat saw right through him, enjoying the hilarious moment while poking a little bit of fun at him.
[84:25.30]And of course, spamming the classic LUL emote.
[84:29.69]fall joke however he recovered after a short break to regain his composure and continued with his personal awards finally moving on to best noise which very my way very well may have been his scream as he fell at least this happened at the end of the year so he might be able to forget about it and get a fresh start in 2020 as long as he remembers to be more careful
[84:56.67]What the fuck happened?
[84:58.27]Plastic surgeon says doing this every morning could snap sagging skin back.
[85:03.07]Or plastic surgeon takes picture of two different people's hands.
[85:15.30]I can't.
[85:15.60]This is fucking crazy.
[85:16.68]This is crazy.
[85:21.82]The best part is Jeremy Elbertson.
[85:25.00]I love it.
[85:27.58]And this part, a real life fall joke.
[85:30.99]Imagine writing this article and going, what does that mean?
[85:44.54]They use the word hilariously six times.
[85:49.16]Would it be a bathwater one?
[85:51.45]No, no, I'm not reading any more articles.
[86:01.64]Hold on.
[86:06.60]This is all news to me.
[86:07.52]What?
[86:08.26]Hold on.
[86:08.42]Wait, wait, wait.

[86:32.54]This is of the black and white.
[86:40.35]This is black and white.
[86:41.21]It's a not safe for worst picture in the article.
[86:50.92]It's alright.
[86:51.26]We just need the first part.
[86:52.12]Alright, hold on.
[87:00.41]This is so funny.
[87:02.56]This is really funny.
[87:03.66]It's really funny for one reason.

[91:36.46]Yeah, I saw the carnival one, too.
[91:42.84]Look at the glossiness of the eye.
[91:46.19]Oh, I saw... Somebody said something about me, and I looked at it, and I got self-conscious for a minute.
[91:51.59]Somebody said that I look, like, just sweaty all the time.
[91:54.89]They said I look like... They said specifically that I look like the girl from Get Out.
[92:00.31]They said he looks really, like, shiny and sweaty all the time.
[92:03.16]He looks like the girl from Get Out.
[92:04.40]And I was like... Alright.

[92:24.65]Who said that?
[92:25.07]It was a fucking thread.
[92:26.59]I read it.
[92:33.03]Your head is constantly rim lit.
[92:34.87]It's because I got a huge ass eyebrow bone.
[92:38.41]Look.
[92:39.91]I have a big fucking eyebrow bone.
[92:42.30]It comes out like this wide.
[92:46.02]But this is fantastic.
[92:46.88]This is very, very, very well done.
[92:51.14]Which concludes the art portion.
[92:54.02]We're going to move on to the video portion now.
[92:57.00]It's Brow Ridge.
[93:00.18]Get your eyebrows threaded?
[93:02.00]No, I mean, Kim does my eyebrows.
[93:04.06]She helps.
[93:04.50]She does like the middle and she cleans up a little bit.
[93:06.42]But I don't want to do too much craziness.
[93:10.20]It's video time.
[93:10.90]We're going to move on to videos.
[93:17.37]Which now we have to turn off the relaxing Animal Crossing music.

[100:54.89]That's a real emotion somebody's having.
[100:57.47]This is going to be scary in like 30 fucking years.
[101:04.06]We got another one of those coming up.
[101:05.78]It's from the same movie, if you could guess.
[101:08.48]It's called Out Am I. Out Am I.
[101:22.21]As of today, Oscorp Industries has surpassed Quest Aerospace as the principal supplier to the United States military.
[101:32.96]In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board, costs are down, revenues are up, and our stock has never been higher.
[101:42.32]Wonderful news, Norman.
[101:43.60]Lost it for a second.
[101:44.44]As a matter of fact, it's the reason we're selling the company.
[101:47.86]What?
[101:48.44]Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing.
[101:52.33]Expanding.
[101:54.29]They made a tender offer we can't ignore.
[101:57.32]Why wasn't I told?
[101:58.64]The last thing they want is a power struggle with entrenched management.
[102:03.12]The deal is off if you come with it.
[102:05.10]Jesus.
[102:05.48]The board expects your resignation in 30 days.
[102:09.14]But you can't do this to me.
[102:14.32]I started this company.
[102:17.58]You know how much I sacrificed?
[102:24.89]Please.
[102:25.57]Norman, the board is unanimous.
[102:29.82]We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.
[102:34.06]I'm sorry.
[102:36.46]You're out, Norman.
[102:42.31]This is actually scary.
[102:48.65]Am I?
[102:58.02]The scariest part is this, right?
[103:01.44]Like, when it gets close, you can kind of see through the cracks a little.
[103:05.53]But right here, it's... That guy could be standing there doing this.
[103:15.33]It's still a little fucked up, but... How long does it take to render this shit?
[103:26.04]The anger part is good, too.
[103:29.96]it takes like 50 hours to render this doesn't it like it takes like a week to render this we have weeks to render Jesus that's insane I started this company you know how much I sacrificed pretty good work pretty good actually no pretty good computer pretty good computer I don't know what you're running this on
[104:00.88]Coming up next is when you show your friend your favorite streamer.
[104:30.83]Oh, man, get that crap off my computer.
[104:32.59]I'm going to get spammed forever.
[104:34.77]But you're going to have to stay with the huge.

[111:39.29]I do cartoon voices.
[111:40.95]I do voiceover.
[111:42.45]I do cartoon characters.
[111:44.13]I'm Family Guy Joe.
[111:46.27]You know, he's a professional.
[111:47.39]Peter, I'm a cop.
[111:48.79]So people like to do impressions.
[111:51.68]What the fuck?

[112:13.60]What should I say?
[112:14.30]Peter.
[112:15.04]Peter.
[112:19.72]His approach there, I think, is right in tune because he is physicalizing.
[112:26.26]He knows that it's his face that's informing his voice.
[112:28.51]I hate this video.
[112:29.33]I feel so fancy.
[112:32.99]This is my wheelchair.

[112:47.36]But we're in the endgame, Peter.
[112:51.37]My kids always make fun of me.
[112:52.75]I think he does a very good job.
[112:53.99]He's got the timber.
[112:55.33]He brings it down Joe is Joe's very officious.
[112:59.84]That's where Joe comes from because he's a police officer So, you know everything that he says he's got a little bit I'm a cop a Good cop, but very fine.
[113:06.00]What was that?
[113:06.60]Oh, I can't do it.
[113:07.28]I'm so full.
[113:07.62]What was that?
[113:08.08]No facial hair
[113:22.01]Okay, I like what he does there with the physicality when you do that that Instructs your voice guys have their tricks, you know my friend Tom Kenny does the this thing and
[113:45.08]It's me, SpongeBob.

[114:38.04]Hey, it's me, Patrick Warburton, Kronk.
[114:40.78]You know, I'm Joe from Family Guy 2, and Peter.

[114:49.15]Kronk?
[114:52.53]Peter.
[114:52.79]That's what he does.
[114:56.65]Problem is, when you look at impressions of yourself, you're like, oh, my God, am I really like that?
[115:00.93]I mean, I don't know who I look like anymore, so that could be me right there.
[115:07.01]Well, I'm Patrick Warburton, and that was my critique of some fantastic work.

[155:22.53]That was good.
[155:24.89]And finally, finally, the last thing of the night, we have germaspiderundertalejoke.wave.
[155:39.93]Question.
[155:41.96]these kind of I guess they go they go together right like giant enemy spider and spider boss from Undertale because this is this is like Undertale crossover number like four or five with giant enemy spider makes sense makes sense let's hear it
[156:09.53]The giant enemy spider!
[156:47.24]Fuck yeah.
[156:50.12]Fuck yeah.
[156:52.30]Good stuff.
[156:55.02]Good stuff.
[156:56.56]Hold on, what the... Alright, here we go.
[157:07.10]Alright.
[157:08.48]Good cider.
[157:10.95]Give us the link.
[157:11.67]You want the link to that one?
[157:13.09]Yeah.
[157:14.19]They're all available in that Discord channel.
[157:22.41]What's going on?
[157:25.95]Year of the rat.
[157:27.75]When was this uploaded?
[157:33.05]Oh, yeah, that's why.
[157:34.51]Yeah.
[157:34.83]So the reason why I didn't put this one in is because this is as of last week.
[157:42.04]And I figured that we can have, obviously, we'll do this again in February.
[157:49.11]Watch it now.
[157:49.65]Well, this is not fair skipping 30 other videos.
[157:52.89]That's not fair.
[157:59.70]Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[158:06.79]Now, the next community content night is not going to be three months from now.
[158:10.27]Don't worry.
[158:13.78]The reasoning to do this up until about like the 15th, 16th to 18th or so is in the first or second week of February, I can actually do another one on time.
[158:28.10]Make an exception.
[158:28.73]It's the year of the rat.
[158:32.05]Make an exception.
[158:32.65]It's the year of the rat.
[158:33.25]It's the year of the rat.
[158:38.35]Alright.
[158:38.87]Alright.
[158:39.19]Fine.
[158:39.53]Fine.
[158:40.39]Alright.
[158:40.75]Alright.
[158:41.05]Alright.
[158:43.38]Alright.
[158:43.72]You're going to be shut down, buddy.
[158:47.94]There's also another video that I want to show, too, that we'll put in the next one as well.
[158:53.21]That was longer than five minutes, but we're going to make an exception for it.
[159:04.96]But yeah, remember, if people are like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?
[159:07.70]I uploaded something to January 23rd.
[159:11.13]That's because it's as of, like, a week ago or so.
[159:14.45]So all these things are as of, like, the weekend of the 18th.
[159:17.00]17th, 18th.
[159:18.18]Hey, stop it.

[159:32.51]He's like, hey, pay attention to me.
[159:34.17]You are so hyper right now.
[159:37.17]He's like a million miles per hour.

[166:15.01]I know, I know, I know, but that's not the right one.
[166:21.66]You guys just... I just got linked to somebody's desktop.
[166:29.03]Oh, here we go.
[166:29.59]Alright.
[166:34.69]That's the wrong one.
[166:35.63]Alright, let's hold on.
[166:36.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[166:39.13]One thing at a time.
[166:41.23]You're the rep.
[167:07.83]the top right, Rhett.
[167:33.62]This is awesome.
[167:34.50]This is awesome.
[168:20.06]We got 30% of the vote.
[168:21.90]That was a lot of votes.
[168:24.16]Rats.
[168:26.34]Year of the rats.
[168:28.58]That was fucking awesome.
[168:31.20]That was so... That was so just... Cute on every level.
[168:37.15]Thank you.
[168:39.05]You want the link?
[168:39.71]I'll give you the link for that one.
[168:43.89]That's some good 2D animation.
[168:45.29]Yeah, it was.
[168:47.61]Alright, now...
[168:49.81]Without further ado, we are going to... Look at this card.
[168:56.13]Look at this card.
[168:59.48]So when I got it linked originally, it was like somebody's desktop.
[169:02.62]But I was like, wait, why am I on someone's... I was like sharing somebody's computer screen and it freaked me out.
[169:07.24]Alright, let me... Let's get this in the right spot.
[169:15.61]So anti-spoiler slide.
[169:17.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[169:18.53]I gotta go back.
[169:21.16]Anti-spoilers slide.
[169:23.56]This card is 250 slides long.
[169:28.37]Holy shit, that's a lot of slides.
[169:32.83]It's huge.
[169:36.17]Holy fuck.
[169:40.20]Oh my god.
[169:44.78]I'm gonna need a whole stream just for this?
[169:51.29]Holy shit.
[169:53.33]We started this in November and you kept pushing CCN back so it got really, really long.
[169:57.51]You'll have to cancel Nancy Drew tonight.
[170:00.66]You'll have to cancel Nancy Drew.
[170:12.53]For real, read it on Tuesday, do it Tuesday.
[170:14.38]Alright, I'm going to tell you this.
[170:17.74]For the purpose of not just blowing through something that's this fucking nice for a community to do to somebody, I don't just want to blow through this.
[170:28.85]So what we're going to do is I have a plan to finish... Well, let's go over some stuff here really briefly.
[170:38.28]So as of tomorrow, I'm not streaming tomorrow because I'm doing some medical shit.
[170:41.96]I got some stuff to do.
[170:42.78]I have a doctor's appointment that is very, very important.
[170:45.68]We have a lot of stuff to talk about.
[170:47.66]But on Tuesday, I have a five-day plan.
[170:53.12]One of those days, I'm going to try to kill Diablo in hardcore.
[170:58.89]So whatever day that is, that stream, that playing D2 against Diablo Hardcore might be like 20 minutes long.
[171:07.56]If I, for some reason, beat Diablo, it's going to be tricky.
[171:14.81]But one of those nights over the five days in a row that I'm going to stream, we will do this.
[171:19.86]I just want to give it, um, I want to give it time that it deserves.
[171:23.24]I don't just want to skip it and be like, oh yeah, it's been six and a half hours.
[171:26.30]Alright.
[171:27.46]Uh, next, next, next.
[171:28.54]Thank you.
[171:28.88]Next.
[171:29.14]Thank you.
[171:29.48]Cool.
[171:29.76]Cool.
[171:30.09]Cool.
[171:30.49]I'd like, I'd like to put time into it.
[171:33.87]So we'll do it one of those days, uh, in the upcoming five days in a row.
[171:40.78]Just read my slide.
[171:42.58]Why would I do that?
[171:47.24]Yeah.
[171:47.76]Well, I have the link now.
[171:49.26]So I'll just, I'll have this bookmarked.
[171:52.64]But to think that somebody made me a card with almost 300 slides on it.
[171:59.15]That's, I don't even know what to say.
[172:02.05]We'll touch upon it when we go over it.
[172:03.44]But there's 282 slides.
[172:07.41]Oh my goodness.
[172:08.85]Am I doing fine health-wise?
[172:11.27]Yes.
[172:12.65]Yes.
[172:13.03]It's just been a pain in the ass.
[172:15.13]And I will have every answer that I'm looking for as of tomorrow.
[172:20.29]Because I had a very, very, very extensive MRI of my entire chest and abdomen and shit.
[172:27.79]So they know that... I don't know.
[172:31.14]Tomorrow I'm getting the results and I'm going to figure out what the hell is going on.
[172:37.06]And then from there, I might have to get an injection into my ribcage.
[172:39.88]I don't know.
[172:40.84]We'll see.
[172:43.94]You're alright?
[172:44.50]Well, then give us the card back.
[172:46.26]Hey!
[172:46.56]No, it's my card now.
[172:49.94]It's mine.
[172:50.40]Holy shit.
[172:54.25]But that'll conclude the kind of double feature here.
[172:56.51]We did some community content stuff.
[172:57.85]Wanted to catch up more into January.
[173:04.32]we did thank you everybody again for contributing to community content night I mean this was community crack night I know but like it's still hilarious you guys are still talented and funny regardless of what you come up with we'll do that again somewhere in the probably end of February middle of February and then we'll be pretty much 100 caught up completely
[173:31.91]But I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[173:34.83]We've got a lot of shit to do for that week.
[173:38.77]We still have... Hmm.
[173:42.56]What do we do on Tuesday?
[173:44.08]When am I going to come back?
[173:46.06]Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.
[173:47.62]Tony Hawk's Underground?
[173:49.56]Hmm.
[173:51.78]Maybe.
[173:54.08]Black and White 2?
[173:56.32]Maybe.
[173:58.24]We'll see.
[173:59.56]No More Heroes 2?
[174:00.16]It's all on the table.
[174:04.40]Let's do the bits and go over the subs and everything.
[174:09.84]Outer Wilds.
[174:10.54]That's on there too.
[174:12.04]Well, I'm streaming five days in a row.
[174:14.51]There's plenty of content, plenty of games to play.
[174:24.31]Yes, there's a chance.
[174:25.97]Yeah, there is.
[174:28.72]Bring back Sam and Max.
[174:29.80]I'm not sure that'll happen.
[174:30.68]I'm sorry to say.
[174:36.69]But let's go back to earlier.
[174:41.16]We had 1,000 bits from Lime Liquor.
[174:43.70]It says, mmm, beans.
[174:47.86]I hope you enjoyed the beans.
[174:48.80]I hope they were good.
[174:51.19]Sounds good.
[174:52.87]LM, man, thanks for the 500 bits.
[174:54.15]Jerma, if you were a meal, I would be your gluten.
[174:58.87]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[174:59.82]I would be your glutton.
[175:02.04]What?
[175:02.20]I got that wrong.
[175:04.81]Oh, the breakfast beans.
[175:05.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[175:06.35]They're good.
[175:06.79]They're really good.
[175:10.29]I would be the gluten.
[175:11.13]I thought it was like, oh, I would be the one.
[175:12.29]I would be like, hold us together.
[175:13.46]You know what I mean?
[175:14.02]Like, I'm the gluten of our, I don't know.
[175:17.28]Not a wolf, man.
[175:17.90]Thanks for 400 bits.
[175:19.68]Derm, I haven't been able to catch a stream in a while, and I wanted to ask, have you played Majesty yet?
[175:24.05]I bugged you a bunch about it during the Sleeping Dog streams, and I wanted an update.
[175:27.89]Keep being cool.
[175:28.73]I did.
[175:30.15]I played the Majesty HD version.
[175:33.13]Did a whole stream on it, yeah?
[175:36.73]It was fun.
[175:38.11]I did play it, though.
[175:39.45]I'll go search through the archives.
[175:40.55]Search through the archives.
[175:43.31]You'll find it.
[175:45.97]It's a good game.
[175:49.85]Thanks for being awesome.
[176:14.74]Well, in relationship-wise, I don't have very much good advice, to be honest.
[176:21.10]Because I haven't really been part of too many relationships.
[176:28.01]And my Tinder was kind of a joke.
[176:30.11]So, I don't really have very much good relationship advice, to be honest with you.
[176:35.54]But, I'm not sure how young you are.
[176:38.48]But if you're taking your ACTs, I'm assuming that you're fairly young.
[176:44.12]So, don't worry.
[176:46.12]There's still plenty of people to meet.
[176:47.21]Plenty of people to talk to.
[176:51.21]And, hope you do well on that test.
[176:55.03]Wrap it up, Jeremy?
[176:56.12]What?
[176:58.62]Hey!
[177:01.42]Wrap it up!
[177:04.25]I just started!
[177:12.03]But anyways, I wish you luck on your ACTs.
[177:21.18]It's not a joke.
[177:21.98]Those things are hard.
[177:24.40]And in my opinion, they're kind of stupid.
[177:26.94]Because why would we put so much on one test?
[177:32.90]It's just like, come on.
[177:33.96]Give me a break.
[177:38.06]SATs, ACTs, it's just like, come on.
[177:40.17]It would really have to do that.
[177:42.98]You really have to make everybody's entire college and high school careers and lives based around one exam?
[177:52.74]Tests are bullshit in the first place.
[177:54.54]Can I just say?
[177:55.02]It's not an indicator of how fucking much you know.
[177:58.52]Here comes another school rant.
[178:03.27]No, no, that's all I gotta say.
[178:04.33]That's it.
[178:04.91]That's all I gotta say.
[178:10.04]But I wish you luck, and I'm really sorry to hear that you've had some relationship issues here.
[178:16.59]Good luck on the test.
[178:20.29]I'm sure you'll do fine.
[178:20.91]Hey, BlackBear, thanks for the 300 bits.
[178:24.84]I'm glad to see you streaming this game.
[178:26.04]The devs are really nice.
[178:27.00]I met them in a stream I was moderating when this game's sequel came out.
[178:30.82]And it's an all-ages game, not a baby game.
[178:35.51]I thought it was very good too.
[178:36.57]It was very charming.
[178:37.37]It was really fun.
[178:37.97]The characters are really cute.
[178:39.69]It's good.
[178:40.67]I just was asking in the very beginning if it was like a putt-putt game.
[178:44.43]I didn't know.
[178:44.95]I just was asking the question.
[178:46.15]That's it.
[178:48.12]I just wanted to know.
[178:54.82]But it wasn't.
[178:55.34]It was just fun.
[178:55.90]It was just cute.
[178:58.54]Become as God.
[178:59.68]Thanks for the five community subs, God.
[179:01.90]Well, becoming God.
[179:03.44]Good luck with that.
[179:05.55]That's the theory.
[179:06.62]We have not stamped the actual diagnosis on that.
[179:10.44]We'll probably figure that out tomorrow.
[179:13.02]Tomorrow's the day when I find out if that's what really is going on.
[179:32.95]But it seems like that's probably what it is, and it's a pain in the ass.
[179:38.18]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[179:39.14]Thanks for watching.
[179:40.12]Frogs are the best.
[179:42.30]Yes.
[179:44.36]Rock writing, thanks for the 500 bits.
[179:46.28]Your first Bernie Sanders voice was veering into Dan Aykroyd Crystal Skull vodka promo video territory.
[179:54.79]I need to hear this.
[179:58.46]I'm Dan Aykroyd.
[179:59.98]Since childhood, I have been fascinated with the invisible world, a world which can help us get through life if we know how to draw upon its power, a world serving positive projections wherein you use your own personal, mental, and spiritual abilities to believe and subsequently make true the things that you want to happen for yourself.
[180:18.72]And landscape painter John Alexander, whose most recent exhibitions include showings at the American Wing.
[180:24.54]I've had the Crystal Skull Vodka before.
[180:26.44]I actually kind of like it.
[180:28.69]I thought it was pretty good.
[180:30.69]I've had it before.
[180:33.68]Then it's in a crystal... What?
[180:35.18]I've had it.
[180:35.90]It's good.
[180:37.66]What's wrong with it?
[180:39.36]Just because it's in a crystal skull doesn't mean it's not good.
[180:42.20]I've heard it's good vodka.
[180:46.22]I mean, it tastes good.
[180:48.09]It tastes fine.
[180:48.85]It's okay.
[180:51.47]It's a scam.
[180:53.92]How can vodka be a scam if it's just vodka?
[180:57.80]It was filtered through... No vodka tastes good.
[181:06.09]Well, you start to like vodka when it's one of the only things you can drink.
[181:08.89]Because it's the most basic, benign alcohol you could possibly consume.
[181:14.11]So yeah, I've drank it.
[181:24.54]Alcohol is a scam.
[181:25.52]I mean, that's a... I mean, whatever.
[181:29.88]Also, stay happy, stay healthy, happy new year.
[181:32.16]Happy new year to you, Ruck.
[181:34.49]Goiki, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[181:36.17]Your voices are actually fucking gold.
[181:39.33]Sometimes I can have some fun.
[181:41.03]Sometimes.
[181:42.71]I just felt like doing it today.
[181:44.75]But it was fun.
[181:47.99]I had a good time.
[181:50.25]This guy is wasted.
[181:53.27]Ooh, that person or me?
[181:54.89]Not me.
[181:56.96]But thank you for the $15.
[181:58.06]I appreciate that.
[182:00.18]Freak out.
[182:01.04]Freak8 out.
[182:01.98]Thanks for the 2,500 bits.
[182:02.93]$25.
[182:03.01]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching you for a couple years now, but being from southern Texas...
[182:10.58]Being from southern Texas, my dad wasn't too keen on me getting my Yankee influence.
[182:16.28]I was able to convince him that you're nothing more than a northern sympathizer, but he was still suspicious.
[182:21.20]Somehow my dad found out and went to the nearby saloon, trying to drink the disappointment out.
[182:25.02]He came home drunk and started... Alright.
[182:32.53]Thanks for the 2,500 bids.
[182:33.15]Appreciate it.
[182:39.91]The music on?
[182:40.62]Oh, fuck.
[182:43.56]Alright.
[182:46.30]Thanks for the- That's a lot of money.
[182:47.64]Thank you.
[182:50.82]I like how he doesn't care about these bits.
[182:55.43]Um, alright.
[182:56.75]You gotta give me a little bit of slack here when somebody, like, RP monologues being, like, attacked by their father.
[183:04.35]What do you want me to do?
[183:05.51]Well, this is- Let me read this.
[183:07.52]Hmm.
[183:08.26]Let's talk about this.
[183:14.13]Hey, thank you!
[183:22.03]It doesn't care.
[183:23.37]It struck a nerve.
[183:24.35]I'm just saying.
[183:26.10]How am I supposed to react to that?
[183:29.08]It's like, what the fuck?
[183:33.80]They also gave... They gave $50.
[183:34.92]5,000 bits.
[183:38.78]After a while, he passed out in front of the TV while watching football.
[183:42.56]I'm typing this after taking his 1984 Ford F-150 and driving under a bridge.
[183:49.93]I just want to say, even though you're a Yankee, and even though we're both guys, I love you.
[183:55.77]That's fine.
[183:56.27]It's all good, man.
[183:59.17]I didn't skip.
[183:59.77]I just read it.
[184:08.74]I love you too, Jeremo.
[184:18.43]Yeah, I skipped the last part of it because I'm not reading that as shit.
[184:23.17]That's why.
[184:23.69]We could be five grand.
[184:33.72]What?
[184:33.98]Oh, okay.
[184:43.90]Anyways, but that's a lot of money.
[184:45.08]Thank you, Freakout.
[184:46.08]Have a wonderful night.
[184:48.58]Thank you.
[184:50.16]Um, okay.
[184:51.26]Freakout gave a shitload more money.
[184:54.78]I don't... I don't know what all this is.
[184:57.71]This is like a bunch of... Okay, let's... Freakout gave another 5,000 bits.
[185:05.55]And it's a bunch of numbers and letters.
[185:09.55]AP, APP, AVR, APPA, AP... What is all this?
[185:14.25]These are codes.
[185:17.47]Codes for what?
[185:19.63]These are nuclear codes.
[185:23.16]What are these codes for?
[185:26.44]B, B, B, C, bug... What the fuck is all this?
[185:34.03]I don't understand what this is for.
[185:38.73]Codes for Crystal Skull Vodka.
[185:42.78]Are they game codes?
[185:43.88]These are not game codes.
[185:47.24]I don't know.
[185:48.38]I'm confused.
[185:51.52]No, they're not Steam codes.
[185:54.84]Freakout, thank you for the codes to whatever it is.
[186:05.44]Thank you for the $100, Freakout.
[186:10.16]Codes or Cods1123, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[186:13.38]I missed it earlier, but thanks for $50.
[186:15.22]Frog Squad, baby.
[186:17.52]Frog Squad.
[186:22.04]Yeah.
[186:22.95]It's got a frog in it.
[186:23.73]I'm going to play it.
[186:24.95]Eventually.
[186:31.41]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[186:32.75]Seriously.
[186:33.07]$50 is a lot of money.
[186:35.97]There was a lot of money that came in during this.
[186:41.29]Thank you.
[186:42.93]I will pass it along to Freddy the Frog.
[186:51.46]Or Frankie the Frog.
[186:55.14]Frankie the Frog.
[187:00.41]Appreciate it.
[187:01.15]Thanks for the $30.
[187:04.96]Uh, TinkerTailorSoldierBatman, thanks for the thousand bits.
[187:10.50]I remember yesterday we had to put my 16-year-old dog down thanks to streaming and making me laugh, even though I'm still crying about it.
[187:17.17]It sucks.
[187:17.91]It always sucks when something like that happens.
[187:19.45]It's a big part of your life.
[187:22.39]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[187:28.74]I hope it was a good dog.
[187:31.90]I think most people have been there before.
[187:33.24]Yeah.
[187:34.00]It just sucks.
[187:35.64]But what I've done over the last almost three decades having animals in the house is when one passes, you spend some time and then, you know, you take care of another one.
[187:49.69]You get a rescue dog that needs a house, needs a home.
[187:53.92]Take a cat in that needs a family.
[187:55.54]You know, and the cycle kind of continues.
[188:01.16]You know?
[188:04.38]That's how it's happened, at least in my family, is not immediately after, but, you know, you still want to take care of something, and that's kind of how it happened with Otto.
[188:15.73]We had a dog that passed away, and we had another dog in the family, and it was like, you know, we always have two dogs, and we're going to have another one.
[188:23.64]That's how it's worked.
[188:27.90]Sorry to hear that, though.
[188:29.80]May they rest in peace.
[188:31.68]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[188:35.48]Noodle is bad at gaming.
[188:36.76]Thanks for 500 bits.
[188:37.60]It's not imaginary.
[188:38.54]He's an astral American.
[188:41.32]I don't know what that means.
[188:43.06]Astral American.
[188:46.11]Like stars?
[188:47.57]Like astronomical?
[188:53.87]Frog VA?
[188:57.87]Oh, oh.
[189:00.48]Yeah, like from outer space.
[189:05.01]I don't know, but thank you.
[189:06.29]Thanks for the $5.
[189:08.23]Ray the Cutler, thanks for $300.
[189:10.25]300 bits.
[189:11.23]Yup, that's not correct.
[189:12.93]300 bits.
[189:13.44]$3.
[189:14.06]Easy contender for the next awards.
[189:17.48]I'm sad that Larry David Ernie voice didn't really materialize so far, but the whole stream is amazing.
[189:23.66]Bugle Bros, where you at?
[189:25.50]Anyway, favorite Curb Your Enthusiasm moment.
[189:31.01]There's a lot.
[189:33.36]Probably the pie in the restaurant with the dancer.
[189:38.50]If I wanted to order it, sir, I would have ordered it.
[189:40.40]Get that fucking pie out of here.
[189:41.88]You eat that fucking pie, Larry.
[189:43.46]No, you get to take this fucking pie and shove it up your fucking head.
[189:47.47]The eat the pie in the restaurant bit was fucking hilarious.
[189:57.41]Larry, you're making me look like a fucking asshole.
[190:02.66]bad.
[190:03.22]There's so many good episodes.
[190:04.38]This is such a funny show.
[190:07.10]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[190:09.44]I finally escaped the virtual world for enough time to catch a stream.
[190:12.50]Please don't let Todd find me and drag me back in.
[190:15.23]Well, Todd, leave him alone.
[190:18.21]And then Dark Soul again for 250.
[190:19.57]Hey, you, you're finally awake.
[190:20.63]You were trying to cross the border, right?
[190:21.99]Walked into that Imperial ambush.
[190:23.89]Same as us.
[190:24.83]And that thief over there.
[190:26.22]Loki, damn you.
[190:27.46]Stormcloaks, Skyrim was fine until you came along.
[190:29.84]Empire was nice and lazy if they hadn't been looking for you.
[190:33.16]Could have stolen that horse and been away to Hammerfell.
[190:35.96]You there, you and me, we should be... Am I reading like a huge spoiler or something?
[190:39.55]It's these Stormcloaks, the Empire ones.
[190:40.99]This is like the end of the game.
[190:42.43]We're all brothers and sisters in vines now.
[190:44.65]Am I reading the end of the game?
[190:46.55]I don't know.
[190:48.19]Thanks for the 250.
[190:49.17]Appreciate it, Dark Soul.
[190:50.79]It's the opening.
[190:51.53]That's literally the opening.
[190:55.70]Whatever.
[190:57.16]We had a shitload of community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.
[191:03.36]30, 40, 45 community subs from Great Canadian.
[191:05.66]Thank you.
[191:06.22]That's a ton of fucking money.
[191:08.02]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[191:08.96]Seriously.
[191:09.36]Great Canadian!
[191:12.26]Pulling fucking 50 goddamn subs.
[191:16.50]All in a row, too.
[191:18.54]LM, man, thanks for the thousand bits.
[191:20.14]Jerma, your strength can make people cry.
[191:21.94]I am pretty strong.
[191:25.64]I'm very strong.
[191:28.27]Stronger than you think.
[191:28.89]I could lift up a whole king-sized bed.
[191:32.77]Just with two hands.
[191:35.91]Not the frame, though.
[191:36.97]Just the bed.
[191:37.83]Just the mattress part.
[191:41.98]Hard to do that shit, you know?
[191:43.26]How floppy and sloppy those things are.
[191:48.37]Uh, 25 Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 250.
[191:49.79]Congratulations, Mr. Elbertson.
[191:51.10]It's with our pleasure to announce you are now new Featured Gamer of the Month for Dr. Pepper.
[191:55.34]I can't say this shit out loud before someone's gonna actually fucking come get me.
[191:59.55]Dr. Pepper Gaming, please accept this 250 as a token of our appreciation.
[192:02.93]Thank you.
[192:03.83]Thank you, Pretend25DrPepper.
[192:05.05]I appreciate that.
[192:09.21]Michael Smells, thanks for the $2.75.
[192:12.35]Leo, you are yeet.
[192:14.16]Thanks for saying that for me.
[192:15.16]It's for an amazing friend.
[192:16.64]You're very welcome.
[192:17.92]Anyway, you're the best.
[192:19.10]Thanks for being there and stuff.
[192:20.36]Sorry chat rails on you so much.
[192:21.92]We all love you so fucking much.
[192:23.32]No, it's all good.
[192:24.10]We're just fucking around.
[192:26.32]We're just messing around.
[192:28.94]We're just having fun.
[192:31.71]Thank you, Michael.
[192:37.35]Why did somebody donate a hundred different porn names?
[192:40.12]Is that what that was?
[192:40.88]I don't, I have no idea.
[192:42.34]That's why, like, I get, like, scared sometimes if random donations come in.
[192:46.34]Hey, click this link.
[192:47.32]Hey, say this word.
[192:48.40]It's like, I, I can't.
[192:51.80]You're gonna get me in trouble.
[192:53.71]I can't.
[192:56.77]Anyway.
[192:57.81]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[192:59.23]Jeremy, glad you liked my courage meme.
[193:02.51]Makes me happy that I can make others laugh.
[193:04.25]Missed most of the stream, but I hope you had a good one.
[193:05.99]I did.
[193:06.25]It was fucking funny.
[193:08.56]That was a really funny ass meme.
[193:15.40]Serial numbers for porn?
[193:18.22]What?
[193:18.86]That's so... Why?
[193:20.76]Why would you give $50 to me and put porn serial numbers in?
[193:26.16]That's $50 you spent!
[193:29.48]That's $50!
[193:32.36]$50!
[193:32.80]That's a lot of money.
[193:34.48]You could have done it with $250, man.
[193:38.53]No, no, don't do that.
[193:39.99]Don't do that.
[193:40.47]If you're gonna do that, you may as well give 50 because that's a lot.
[193:43.41]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[193:45.59]Don't do that.
[193:46.45]Don't fucking do that shit.
[193:50.96]Read, read the codes.
[193:54.32]Hey, Smarky, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[193:58.30]$15.
[193:58.34]Thanks a lot, Sparky.
[193:59.16]Hey, Jeremy, it's been a while since I've donated.
[194:00.56]I just need to remind you that you still haven't played the Claire Bee on Resident Evil 2.
[194:06.16]I know.
[194:06.51]Thank you for the bi-monthly reminder that I haven't played the second half of my favorite game from 2019.
[194:13.21]Appreciate it.
[194:14.55]Yep.
[194:14.87]Thank you.
[194:18.19]Yep, yep, yep.
[194:19.09]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[194:23.22]What were the codes?
[194:24.66]Doesn't matter.
[194:25.54]Who cares?
[194:28.83]But thank you, Smarky.
[194:29.73]I think about it every night before I go to bed.
[194:31.17]That's passive-aggressive.
[194:32.95]What?
[194:33.65]No.
[194:39.75]Alright, alright.
[194:40.76]I will admit that I think about it every night before I go to bed.
[194:43.58]It may have been a small, a small little bit passive-aggressive.
[194:48.38]It may have been.
[194:51.10]I admit that.
[194:51.82]Okay.
[194:54.27]Everyone's just keeping those codes for himself.
[194:59.77]Alright.
[195:02.31]You guys are fucking crazy.
[195:05.56]Fly4Shy, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[195:08.22]LizTheSquirrel5, ya boi, 10 community subs.
[195:10.80]Thank you guys.
[195:12.38]I'll be back to back there.
[195:17.30]Really appreciate it.
[195:17.84]It's a lot of money.
[195:18.78]10 community subs is a fucking lot of money.
[195:20.72]It's a lot of money.
[195:22.52]It's a lot of fucking money.
[195:28.43]Apple ship, thanks for the 250.
[195:29.53]Hey, I'm glad you liked my drawing.
[195:30.95]I didn't expect the speed paint to be shown, too.
[195:33.73]Took me 10 to 12 hours to complete.
[195:37.97]As in, is incredible.
[195:40.49]Happy to show the process, too.
[195:42.17]That was really, really cool.
[195:47.03]Thank you.
[195:49.59]Great work.
[195:52.19]How would you use those codes?
[195:54.01]I don't know.
[195:54.53]Stop asking those questions.
[195:57.22]Stop asking and talking about that.
[195:59.67]What are you guys doing?
[196:09.27]WembleyTTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[196:11.19]If ads get to you, you do sound like a guy who would download fake PC security programs and getting a hundred toolbars on IE.
[196:19.02]You must have downloaded BonziBuddy in your life as well.
[196:21.48]I did.
[196:23.26]BonziBuddy was fun.
[196:24.86]At least that was a fun virus.
[196:27.08]I'm okay with that one.
[196:27.82]Heh.
[196:52.71]Filactory, lich, thanks for the... Fuck me.
[196:55.15]Filactory, lich, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[196:57.41]$50 from Filactory again, like every stream.
[197:05.42]That Austin Powers deepfake was just Jerma's family dinner part two.
[197:13.91]Something like that.
[197:17.99]Thank you, Phylactery, for your, like, $7,000 you've given this stream over the last four months.
[197:24.03]And I mean that, like, unironically, that's, like, probably how much it's been.
[197:27.70]More than that, probably.
[197:30.46]Rick Bill, thanks for the 500 bits.
[197:35.67]Here's some funds for your upcoming legal battle with Nintendo.
[197:38.03]Keep up the good work.
[197:38.73]I'm the number one Labo streamer on Twitch.
[197:41.49]At least 30 people bought a Labo because of me.
[197:44.65]Right?
[197:45.41]Was it 9,000 people that were concurrently watching the Labo stream?
[197:49.05]Okay.
[197:49.75]At least 24 people bought a Labo because of me.
[197:53.21]Come on.
[197:53.59]They're not gonna come out.
[198:02.70]They'd have to pay me to buy a Labo.
[198:05.24]Don't say that.
[198:05.86]Say I bought one and it was fucking fun.
[198:08.36]This joke wasn't worth ten bucks.
[198:32.56]I don't even know.
[198:33.36]What's that saying?
[198:33.76]I don't wipe my ass?
[198:34.58]I don't get it.
[198:37.20]Seven layer Wario.
[198:38.15]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[198:39.45]Ten dollars.
[198:39.91]Here's some bits for you.
[198:40.61]Medical troubles.
[198:41.91]I know how hard that it can be and I hope it goes well.
[198:44.21]Best of wishes.
[198:44.77]Hope you're doing great.
[198:45.47]Have a good night.
[198:46.05]You too.
[198:49.95]Thanks for the consideration.
[198:50.91]Thanks for the support.
[198:53.45]Anybody that's ever had mystery medical problems that you don't know what the hell's wrong with you.
[198:56.29]I've had them too and it sucks.
[198:57.43]This is round two.
[198:58.64]It's really annoying.
[199:01.77]Back when I first had the colitis and Crohn's.
[199:04.53]You have Crohn's, you have colitis, you have proctitis.
[199:07.19]When all that bullshit.
[199:08.29]That went on five, six, seven straight years.
[199:11.31]And I finally figured it out, and I've been alright with that.
[199:13.56]Here we go again, round two.
[199:15.82]Oh, now you have, like, chest and back pain.
[199:17.60]Like, it's, like, internal pain.
[199:20.64]Alright, who fucking knows what the hell it is.
[199:22.06]Good luck.
[199:22.36]See you in three years when you find out.
[199:24.10]It's a pain in the ass.
[199:25.55]But you do what you gotta do.
[199:29.69]You do what you gotta do and you just try to figure it out.
[199:32.08]That's all you can do.
[199:39.50]I didn't realize you were having medical problems recently when I donated that.
[199:42.19]No, it's all good.
[199:42.99]Don't worry.
[199:44.01]I'm fine.
[199:44.61]I'm doing just fine.
[199:45.75]If I wasn't fine, I wouldn't stream.
[199:49.13]If I was seriously in pain or if I was uncomfortable right now, I would not be live.
[199:53.44]And you guys all know that.
[199:55.26]I hope that I've made that really clear.
[199:58.56]If I was not having a good time, I'm not forcing myself to turn a stream on.
[200:04.64]Trust me.
[200:06.10]Absolutely not.
[200:10.07]If it ever got there, I would take time off.
[200:12.99]And you know I would.
[200:14.63]So don't worry about me.
[200:15.57]I'm going to be just fine.
[200:24.12]I was under the impression that you shit your pants every single stream.
[200:28.11]Yeah, but that's completely unrelated.
[200:29.55]Halo.
[200:30.51]Alright, I have to play Halo just by myself silently.
[200:31.97]Like, maybe on stream.
[200:32.69]I'm not going to play it on Legendary.
[200:33.93]I'm just going to be silent and play it.
[200:58.32]I'm gonna bump you for a second here.
[201:00.26]Sorry about that.
[201:02.68]You alright?
[201:03.78]Let's get the credits going.
[201:05.88]Here come all the subs.
[201:06.68]There was a lot of community subs, as you see.
[201:08.08]There's a shitload of subs on this channel.
[201:09.74]Almost 11,000.
[201:10.32]There are almost 11,000 subs on the channel.
[201:13.53]11 fucking thousand subs, right?
[201:16.71]That's bonkers.
[201:18.03]That's crazy.
[201:19.45]Still.
[201:23.27]Hopefully I spent it well.
[201:25.45]I hope to.
[201:28.54]Still climbing.
[201:33.19]We good, we good, we good.
[201:40.51]Maybe don't let us down by promising a Reach stream.
[201:43.53]I streamed Halo Reach.
[201:44.85]No, no, no.
[201:45.69]Hold on.
[201:46.13]This has to be corrected.
[201:48.23]I promised a Halo Reach stream and I played Halo 2.
[201:51.81]I played Halo Reach with Joel and it was one of the worst streams I ever did.
[201:56.92]I did play it.
[201:57.90]That was on one of the worst streams of 2019.
[202:05.30]That's what was voted.
[202:06.26]It was voted as one of the worst streams of 2019.
[202:08.28]I liked that stream.
[202:15.04]But I'm sure the CEO of Burger King thinks the chicken fries are good.
[202:18.84]So, I mean... What do I... More community subs.
[202:29.00]But who were they?
[202:32.20]Who were they?
[202:33.70]They're coming up right here.
[202:35.04]20 community subs from Cyclops Parker.
[202:38.52]Thank you for the 20 subs.
[202:43.62]Adam to the group of 11,000 of you guys.
[202:47.42]Holy shit.
[202:50.30]I can't believe I'm saying that out loud.
[202:54.62]This channel has gotten so much more.
[202:59.90]It's grown like four times in the last year and a half.
[203:05.36]It's like quadrupled in size in two years.
[203:13.01]Jesus.
[203:14.49]Hope you still like it.
[203:16.29]I'm trying.
[203:18.43]But... Another five community subs from witty username on top of the 20 from Cyclops.
[203:24.39]Parker, thank you both of you.
[203:27.88]300 bits from Gooberry Juice.
[203:29.96]Hello, Mr. 985.
[203:31.66]Love you and your fan base.
[203:32.62]Just kidding.
[203:33.12]It's Egypt.
[203:33.82]And they are both... And they were both pyro pyros.
[203:37.86]Yes, yes.
[203:38.30]PogChamp.
[203:38.88]Jermavine is PogChamp.
[203:40.47]It was me, Gooberry Juice, all this time, idiot.
[203:42.75]I sent the anonymous bits and wanted to do a joke, but it didn't work.
[203:45.55]So here is more, I guess.
[203:48.95]Oh, we have 300 bits from an anonymous cheer with no message.
[203:55.44]Thank you.
[203:56.14]Appreciate it.
[203:59.35]Crack donation message.
[204:00.67]Yeah, that's a crack message.
[204:03.98]Very nice.
[204:04.56]Thanks for the $2.50.
[204:05.08]Did you ever play Dead Island?
[204:06.80]It's a buggy piece of crap sometimes, but it'd be cool to watch you smash some zombies.
[204:10.20]No, I didn't.
[204:13.12]No?
[204:14.09]Still have to play Dead Rising 3.
[204:14.99]More zombie games.
[204:17.35]And then Dying Light 2 comes out eventually.
[204:19.71]So... Maybe we'll do that too.
[204:23.55]Maybe we'll do them all.
[204:27.47]Right now, oh, Muffin gave 300 bits.
[204:29.14]Stop apologizing for, aye, aye, aye, Jerma.
[204:31.34]You don't have to apologize for art.
[204:33.12]I know.
[204:36.64]I know.
[204:37.76]I know.
[204:38.38]I know.
[204:38.84]I know.
[204:41.09]Avery dropped dead.
[204:41.91]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[204:42.83]Hey, Jerma, I just got off from my shift at Taco Bell, and I'm elated to see my favorite streamer.
[204:47.79]I'm having dreams of us just hanging out and being friends, probably because I fall asleep listening to you.
[204:53.10]Wow, I wonder how many people have dreams of me hanging out with them because I'm in your ear talking while you're asleep.
[205:03.37]Well, this dream was probably not one you wanted to go to bed to.
[205:07.23]Because I was fucking Bernie Sanders and shit.
[205:13.67]And Donald Trump and Obama.
[205:15.35]There was a lot going on in that first two hours.
[205:17.33]So I wonder what kind of dream you had.
[205:23.08]I'll have to say, hope the medical stuff goes well.
[205:24.82]Thank you.
[205:25.90]Me too.
[205:28.62]Me too.
[205:32.00]And, with that, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[205:36.40]Thanks for hanging out.
[205:38.44]As always, thanks for spending time.
[205:42.02]That's not, I clicked the wrong thing.
[205:44.68]That's also the wrong thing.
[205:47.54]That's the correct one.
[205:49.85]Figured it out.
[205:50.33]It only took three tries.
[205:54.07]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[205:55.11]I'm gonna get some shit done.
[205:57.64]And then as of Tuesday, we're starting early on Tuesday.
[205:59.96]We're starting at probably somewhere around 12 p.m.
[206:05.30]Pacific on Tuesday.
[206:06.32]I'm gonna start pretty very early.
[206:08.31]Because I got some stuff to do in the evening Tuesday, but I do want to get a stream in.
[206:15.43]So we'll see you Tuesday morning, afternoon-ish, like around like 12 p.m.
[206:18.53]Pacific.
[206:25.36]See you then.
[206:25.66]See you on Tuesday.
[206:28.36]Gooberry Juice, right at the end, gave 300 bits.
[206:30.18]Hola, Senor985.
[206:32.24]Ignore my last donation.
[206:33.50]I fucked up twice.
[206:34.44]I promise I'll be funny next time.
[206:35.70]I'm sorry I fucked up so bad.
[206:37.10]PepeHands.

[206:41.30]It's all good.
[206:42.33]You're good.
[206:42.79]You're fine.
[206:43.25]Don't worry.
[206:44.75]Everything's good.
[206:47.63]You're fine.
[206:48.27]You're doing just...
[206:54.05]Alright, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[206:57.57]Good night.

[207:11.31]Well, thank you for what you did.
[207:12.23]That's very kind of you.
