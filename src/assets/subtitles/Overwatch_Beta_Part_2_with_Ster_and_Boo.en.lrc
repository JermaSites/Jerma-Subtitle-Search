[ve:60.16.100]

[00:39.74]What's up?
[00:41.31]How are ya?
[00:53.10]What's my gimmick?
[00:54.39]Hey guys, hi.
[00:56.16]Right?
[00:58.47]That's the gimmick, right?
[01:00.16]From what I understand.
[01:08.53]Now traveling to King's Row, Hanamura.
[01:14.31]Gotta warm the hands up.
[01:18.84]First game, first game of the day.
[01:27.12]Whoa.
[01:29.03]Something ain't right.
[01:32.10]That was weird.
[01:33.85]Looks like we're... What is going on right now?
[01:36.88]I don't even know what team I'm on.
[01:38.03]Okay, I'm on blue team.
[01:39.43]You're always on blue team.
[01:44.29]Geez one of these games where you just get thrown in That ain't cool
[01:55.76]Oh, my melee button's unbound.
[01:56.97]Oh, every time.
[01:59.06]Every time.
[01:59.46]Alright, I'm going to show you guys.
[02:00.50]Ready?
[02:01.77]I don't know why this happens.
[02:03.31]I don't understand.
[02:04.78]Watch this.
[02:06.63]Quick melee.
[02:08.24]It's unbound every time.
[02:09.99]It doesn't matter what I do.
[02:11.81]Even if I make it this primary one, J, it doesn't matter.
[02:15.04]It's always unbound.
[02:16.87]Every single time.
[02:18.95]Like, why did... Quick Melee is the only one.
[02:23.13]Literally the only one.
[02:26.73]I don't know why.
[02:30.22]What happened to yesterday's video?
[02:31.49]I didn't finish it in time.
[02:33.48]It's done now, but I'm not going to upload it at like 10 in the morning.
[02:38.13]It'll go up tonight, don't worry.
[02:39.62]You'll see it.
[02:44.24]Here he comes.
[02:47.84]No!
[02:48.24]He's got a shield on him.
[02:52.31]He's trying to climb over though.
[02:54.13]Shelf.
[02:57.06]Yes he is.
[03:00.56]Why is it that I am so... Stop the screen.
[03:03.69]Defend objective A.
[03:06.76]What is happening?
[03:07.93]Everything.
[03:11.26]My head hurts right now looking at this.
[03:14.66]We're attacking Objective-A and it won't go away.
[03:20.51]Please get off my screen.
[03:29.60]I seriously won't get away.
[03:35.06]I might leave this game because I seriously am having trouble comprehending anything right now.
[03:45.75]Ah, it's still there.
[03:51.50]Especially because it's blinking, it's making all these weird flashing
[03:57.13]Defend objective A.
[03:58.12]We just passed objective A.
[04:02.49]Alright, Blizzard.
[04:03.63]Where's my button to send bugs?
[04:05.48]I can't even see.
[04:06.14]I'm barely able to even tell who I'm pulling.
[04:10.37]Imagine if that was on the screen the whole time.
[04:21.09]somehow actually pulling people though oh this is seriously I'm gonna like
[04:29.58]I might have to actually exit the game here.
[04:43.48]Break it down, hooray.
[04:45.63]Maybe we can continue to defend this objective.
[05:05.69]Maybe if I die, it'll go away.
[05:08.72]Because it's actually going to do a respawn screen.
[05:11.13]There's a drunk guy who's just been behind us the whole time.
[05:20.17]Where's my reload HUD in the console?
[05:27.09]It honestly wouldn't even be that bad if it wasn't directly in the middle of the screen with all the particle effects on it.
[05:36.13]Did I have a good hard-boiled egg this morning?
[05:37.58]Of course I did.
[05:40.07]Absolutely.
[05:42.10]I had two of them actually.
[05:44.11]And the, uh, spinach blueberry pineapple drink.
[05:48.26]So I'm ready to go.
[05:48.90]I'm ready to defend objective A.
[06:01.80]Yellow Rift
[06:19.35]How funny would it be if it turned out, at the very end of this, if we lose this game, I get a win.
[06:26.12]Now that would be something to talk about.
[06:35.55]Did I have garlic?
[06:36.31]No.
[06:36.65]It was a drink.
[06:37.80]You don't want to drink garlic.
[06:40.88]Kind of loud if you did.
[06:44.58]I'm actually just waiting to get out of this game.
[06:49.08]I would be very happy if this ended very quickly.
[06:57.22]Okay.
[06:58.56]I won.
[07:00.58]What?
[07:13.48]Yeah, that message is bugged.
[07:14.85]That's not supposed to do that.
[07:15.80]That's supposed to be on the screen for about four seconds.
[07:19.44]That was a bug.
[07:21.72]I probably actually should report that, because... How do I do that?
[07:26.56]Is there like a... No, I'll probably just...
[07:29.18]I'm gonna send like a message to somebody.
[07:32.84]See if it would help.
[07:39.39]I'm going to leave the game just to kind of make sure that doesn't happen again.
[07:45.56]Let's load a different menu.
[07:47.06]Here we go, see.
[07:49.24]Okay.
[07:51.38]Let's try that again.
[07:53.13]I'm going to assume it had something to do with me getting into that game mid-game and taking somebody else's spot.
[07:59.73]Maybe they were on the other team.
[08:02.27]And it put me on the other, maybe two people rage quit at the same time.
[08:05.85]And it didn't know what team I was supposed to be on.
[08:15.13]Please don't show up again.
[08:23.35]Prepare your defenses.
[08:32.09]Yeah, hi.
[08:33.17]It's currently Tuesday morning, right?
[08:36.15]Is it Tuesday?
[08:37.48]I think it is.
[08:39.51]I lose track of days sometimes.
[08:41.72]My brain has trouble.
[08:49.38]I like this guy's name.
[08:51.45]Sweaty.
[08:55.88]Okay, prepare your defenses.
[08:57.71]Thank God.
[09:00.90]I really thought that was going to stay there.
[09:03.59]That actually would have probably been pretty funny.
[09:06.46]Okay.
[09:07.89]Time to play the game.
[09:09.37]Unobstructed.
[09:20.10]Unobstructed view.
[09:23.07]Attackers incoming in 30 seconds.
[09:30.42]I gotta stand next to it.
[09:32.30]So people know it's me.
[09:40.33]What do we have?
[09:42.50]It's Metro.
[09:44.18]No healer.
[09:45.77]I'm the only tank.
[09:47.50]Technically.
[09:50.64]Well, I think it's okay.
[09:52.31]It'll be fine.
[09:59.94]The Eva?
[10:03.78]Ooh.
[10:05.11]Hurts.
[10:18.47]Shit, there's too many people over there.
[10:20.34]I'm in deep trouble.
[10:27.71]Behind everybody though.
[10:33.99]Ohhhh!
[10:38.29]We're getting rolled.
[10:48.50]Now if I can get in here, I can...
[10:55.19]Draft again?
[10:58.41]They push so fast so far that I was behind every single person.
[11:18.79]Let's try that again.
[11:31.57]They're grouped up very well, and they have Azaria, so that makes it even harder.
[11:42.57]Fire at will!
[11:53.49]Hmm, Winston.
[12:00.53]Anybody else?
[12:06.13]That was pretty lucky, not gonna lie.
[12:09.30]Come on, show yourself.
[12:14.24]Show your face.
[12:21.99]Somebody must be talking.
[12:23.58]Somebody must be talking.
[12:25.24]They know I'm behind.
[12:27.85]My Reaper.
[12:29.04]Wow, I almost just fell off the edge.
[12:33.35]Or did I?
[12:37.15]My Reaper Roadhog strategy is working.
[12:40.87]Oh, I'm so dead here.
[12:45.58]How am I still alive?
[12:47.25]It's not even...
[12:51.62]There we go, I died.
[12:57.58]Can you cancel your ult early on Roadhog?
[12:59.29]I don't think so.
[13:01.40]I tried a couple times there.
[13:03.94]You might be able to.
[13:04.85]I don't know.
[13:05.37]Maybe it's... No?
[13:06.48]I don't think so.
[13:10.37]It's definitely not right click or left click or mouse buttons.
[13:21.22]Really?
[13:22.75]You gonna throw that bubble up right when I'm about to throw the hook?
[13:26.77]You good player, you.
[13:33.52]Send him to space.
[13:49.76]More fire in the hole.
[13:52.88]Where is it?
[13:53.68]I think it's gone.
[13:59.53]What the fuck?
[14:01.20]I don't know how that didn't hit her.
[14:13.94]Can I get a tracer now?
[14:17.30]No, that stupid fucking bubble!
[14:20.25]Oh, I don't like that character.
[14:22.42]I don't like that character.
[14:23.56]I don't like that character.
[14:24.67]I don't like that character!
[14:25.79]Not Tracer.
[14:31.15]the Don't Worry, You're Invincible character, aka Zarya.
[14:57.46]Who's up?
[14:57.89]I swear to god that was Bastion.
[15:12.70]I thought I was gonna keep walking.
[15:23.25]I'll just keep denying this Winston's ult everytime.
[15:26.40]Did I just send him off the end of the map?
[15:28.58]No.
[15:41.08]Oh shit.
[15:42.77]I can't kill him.
[15:51.39]Well, I did some stuff.
[16:05.65]You'll sub if you make multiple colors of the jermaMoon.
[16:09.60]Something I was thinking about doing.
[16:16.72]Forget it, we're gonna just do it.
[16:26.38]Or the Discord.
[16:35.96]I love the self-heal.
[16:37.31]The reason I like this character so much is not necessarily the hooking, it's the self-heal.
[16:42.04]It's so satisfying.
[16:49.61]Ooh.
[16:51.42]I got hurt.
[16:53.37]13-13.
[16:54.88]Every elimination has been a final blow.
[16:58.03]I actually don't think I've ever seen that before.
[17:00.62]At least for me.
[17:06.13]Yes, I picked the name Squeaky Squawk.
[17:08.34]That is correct.
[17:12.24]Uh-oh.
[17:12.58]That's not good.
[17:14.69]Not good.
[17:23.97]Who did I pull?
[17:24.66]Did I pull the Tracer?
[17:32.88]And we lose.
[17:33.82]It's alright.
[17:36.41]Yeah, I picked Squeaky Squawk so I don't know who I was, but now everybody does.
[17:39.22]So, you know, whatever.
[17:40.93]It is what it is.
[17:48.69]Damn, Daniel back at it again with Roadhog.
[17:57.60]Daniel.
[18:01.82]Damn.
[18:15.52]I pull the ulting Zen, yeah.
[18:19.34]That's actually a pretty good strategy.
[18:21.90]If you can pull a Zenyatta away from everybody while he's ulting, even if you die, you're still denying every one of those people a heal.
[18:34.71]Oh, it's a meme?
[18:36.08]Oh, okay.
[18:46.89]I go by a lot of different aliases.
[18:50.27]That is true.
[18:51.82]Big Earl.
[18:54.18]That was the smite one.
[18:55.13]That was so I could talk shit and smite.
[19:00.37]I use that sometimes in various places.
[19:02.47]Big Earl.
[19:18.58]What's the origin story of the jermaMoon emote?
[19:22.97]I took a picture at BlizzCon.
[19:28.10]And I just messed around with all the exposure on the picture.
[19:31.98]And it was a really bad picture too.
[19:33.27]I don't know what I was doing.
[19:34.51]I was trying to take like a...
[19:36.10]Hey, look at me with Blizzcon picture and it was just terrible.
[19:40.39]So...
[19:41.11]I just uploaded it to Twitter without any context with just a terrible bunch of exposure on it and a bunch of weird settings.
[19:48.57]And it was just disgusting.
[19:51.83]And it turns out that it reminded me of the surface of the moon.
[19:57.14]There's your origin story.
[19:58.36]I just decided to do it.
[20:05.14]Yeah, it's a picture on Twitter.
[20:13.50]It's like one of the only pictures I've ever uploaded of just a selfie in quotes on Twitter.
[20:18.37]I think it is the only one.
[20:19.73]Maybe I had one with a Gloomern Glue Man t-shirt on.
[20:23.49]I've taken like three selfies and that's one of them.
[20:26.72]God, I hate that word.
[20:27.68]I hate saying that word.
[20:29.71]Can I just call it a picture of myself?
[20:31.73]I took a picture of myself.
[20:35.26]We got a secondary Roadhog.
[20:44.59]OK.
[20:52.70]Mmm, Tracer.
[20:56.07]Tracer.
[21:00.34]Is she in here?
[21:06.80]Wowie.
[21:09.20]I went from 600 to zero.
[21:10.55]What did it?
[21:13.87]Do you see how many things I just got hit with?
[21:17.81]I got hit with a Symmetra Full Ball, a Direct Rocket, an Orb of Discord, and Soldier: 76, right?
[21:23.86]No, not Junkrat.
[21:26.72]That was fun.
[21:28.33]There's a lot of different things hitting me.
[21:34.73]Did I just get an orb of Discord on me through the wall?
[21:37.84]Did that just happen to me?
[21:39.31]Oh, whatever, we're gonna take this.
[21:43.42]No support.
[21:48.16]Holy shit, this room is in the microwave.
[22:06.25]They need Mini-Sentries?
[22:07.12]They already have them.
[22:09.29]Symmetra.
[22:14.26]Symmetra can play six of them.
[22:17.02]I gotta do some damage here.
[22:33.58]Damn This ain't going so well right now
[22:42.92]Make an extremely high-res version on a shirt.
[22:48.00]I don't know.
[22:48.70]It would be kind of funny, but...
[22:52.36]Realistically, how many people would buy that shirt?
[22:56.15]It's got to be less than 100.
[22:59.11]That is such an awful image.
[23:05.45]Where is she?
[23:10.63]Zenyatta really is giving me a pain.
[23:19.15]That always seems to happen with, when you face a second Roadhog, when you go Roadhog V Roadhog,
[23:24.15]No one is going to kill each other.
[23:25.27]One person is going to get hooked and the other person is going to get hooked and then one of you is going to die from somebody else.
[23:30.15]That's usually what happens.
[23:37.50]I'm just gonna ult around the corner Was there a trap there?
[23:44.29]I thought I shot it
[23:48.58]Did I not shoot the trap?
[23:49.82]I thought I got...
[23:50.51]There was a trap and a mine.
[23:51.48]I didn't get rid of both of them?
[23:56.45]You'd wear that shirt every day.
[23:57.75]Yeah, but I mean, let's talk about pre-production into a campaign on Teespring.
[24:07.50]The art, like, image, like, I don't know.
[24:09.89]I feel like I'd be operating at a loss.
[24:16.39]I think I gotta switch off Roadhog for now, because we don't really have...
[24:21.47]We need some, like, pushing power.
[24:26.26]A little Winston.
[24:28.22]I shot the mine, not the trap.
[24:31.52]I thought I would have hit them both.
[24:37.54]This guy's got Orb of Harmony on him too.
[24:55.60]Am I the only person here?
[25:05.75]Well, I made him ult.
[25:11.82]Really glad you got around to putting in that substantial bio.
[25:17.45]I don't know.
[25:17.88]Okay, so here's the deal, right?
[25:20.25]This is my day-to-day, like, what I do, right?
[25:23.84]This will maybe give some insight of why I haven't done a bio or why I haven't done a bunch of links or anything, right?
[25:29.85]I stream right now.
[25:31.80]I'm streaming right now.
[25:34.51]After this stream is over, after like a couple hours or two, three hours, but I usually stream for two or three hours or something when I feel like it.
[25:41.36]I'll go, I'm like done on the computer and I'm like, alright, I'm going to like go take a break, get some food, go to the bathroom, you know, et cetera, whatever, right?
[25:50.59]When I come back to the computer, there's something else that has more priority, that's more important than me typing in that chat box.
[25:59.94]Or like getting like HTML code to like make a substantial biography on my Twitch profile.
[26:05.87]Five enemies hooked, that's fucking terrible.
[26:08.83]You know what I mean?
[26:10.56]Like, so right now it's in my head, but in two or three hours, I can guarantee you it's not going to be in my head.
[26:18.40]And I'll be doing something else that will have taken priority.
[26:21.11]And then tomorrow's gonna happen, and it's still there.
[26:23.58]And I'm gonna...
[26:24.14]Remember, I'm gonna say something about it if I stream tomorrow?
[26:28.05]That's just the way it is.
[26:42.60]Get a donation box set up.
[26:46.76]I don't know.
[26:50.43]I'm pretty sure it's a broken record at this point.
[26:54.23]I don't think I really need to discuss it any more than I already have.
[26:59.24]Don't forget to brush your teeth.
[27:00.43]Let's go back to Roadhog.
[27:18.21]What does that say?
[27:21.48]What are all these things?
[27:22.94]Okay, ready?
[27:23.39]Somebody translate everything on the screen.
[27:25.95]I'm talking like up there.
[27:27.72]What does every single thing say?
[27:29.91]You have 12 seconds.
[27:35.71]I expect a substantial... autobiography.
[28:00.80]Blue team base ahead.
[28:01.93]I should play Tracer.
[28:04.30]Ooh, no, no, no.
[28:17.69]Goodness.
[28:28.63]You can help out with stuff like shirts and stream and stuff.
[28:32.82]Here's the problem, right?
[28:33.79]Like, I'm one of those people.
[28:36.27]That's an absolute psychopath, right?
[28:40.35]I like have to give valuation to things in my life.
[28:45.01]It's very funny.
[28:45.96]I'm a pretty mathematical person, guys.
[28:47.75]I might not seem like a very mathematician, math magician, but I am.
[28:51.73]And I try to give like valuation to everything that I do.
[28:57.75]So, what is the stream worth?
[29:00.55]You know what I mean?
[29:02.72]What I don't like about donation boxes is like, what is this stream worth?
[29:07.00]And it's like, could it, is it, if somebody donates like a hundred bucks, it's like, oh my, oh my God, where's the, where's the valuation?
[29:13.92]What's like the Jerma stock?
[29:14.79]I don't know what it is.
[29:15.55]I don't like it.
[29:18.91]Should have killed.
[29:19.76]I should have grabbed him.
[29:20.64]I should have grabbed him and we're gonna make up for it right now.
[29:22.57]Watch this.
[29:24.24]I'm only gonna punch him.
[29:25.73]It's okay.
[29:25.97]I won.
[29:42.67]It's so hard to kill Lucios like that.
[29:44.10]It really is.
[29:49.68]Ah, man.
[29:58.64]His stream is worth about six bucks.
[30:01.87]But that's the thing.
[30:02.42]It's like sometimes you get like these donuts.
[30:04.00]I just feel odd.
[30:06.28]If somebody were to ever donate that amount of money, it would make me feel, like, just strange.
[30:17.15]Cause I wouldn't even know like, is that, did I just take like a hundred bucks from somebody?
[30:22.86]Did that just happen?
[30:26.94]Come on, jump again.
[30:29.90]You know what?
[30:30.28]Forget it.
[30:41.14]Do we have, no we need more, gotta go Winston.
[30:46.99]It's hard to play Roadhog when your team's locked out of everywhere.
[30:51.19]Imagination is the essence of discovery.
[31:01.99]You'd be surprised how many people... Yeah, I mean, I guess valuation is determined by who is paying or giving the money, I guess?
[31:14.02]It's not like how you value what you're doing, it's maybe what other people are valuing, watching.
[31:19.25]That's like the theory, right?
[31:21.62]Did I not get hit by that?
[31:24.18]Apparently not.
[31:28.02]Punch him in the button.
[31:29.15]I was trying to punch him in the button.
[31:45.59]And plus, isn't there like a thing right now with like chargebacks and stuff?
[31:48.59]It's just something I don't ever really want to get into.
[31:59.65]Oh boy.
[32:12.30]I'm still on it.
[32:18.11]I might get a ult.
[32:22.95]Yeah guys, we're not in the concentration part of the stream yet.
[32:28.35]We're in the talk.
[32:30.09]We're in the talk about stuff part of the stream.
[32:33.72]I regret it.
[32:46.21]Still alive?
[32:48.29]Oh.
[33:05.92]Hot ham and cheese sandwich.
[33:16.45]Lots of pain.
[33:22.14]Lots of pain.
[33:26.55]I thought I just jumped out of that.
[33:28.37]That would have been so bad.
[33:34.65]Chargebacks happen in all businesses.
[33:36.77]You've been having problems.
[33:37.93]Yeah, I know.
[33:47.58]I'm actually surprised we got that pulled back.
[33:51.64]What?
[33:52.00]Whoops.
[34:07.14]Yeah, like 60% of the time I'm not going to chat.
[34:09.03]Just kind of reading what people have to say.
[34:10.20]People are making some good points.
[34:21.87]Best round lost.
[34:29.31]Seems he's trained his play video games and talk at the same time.
[34:31.88]That's never a thing.
[34:33.28]I'm so awful when it comes to that.
[34:35.93]A lot of people ask, what happened to...
[34:39.66]You used to play games for like 20 minutes live and record it and put it up.
[34:44.82]Since I've gotten older, it's become much harder to do that.
[34:51.15]I used to build, when I was like, way back in the day, when I was like, you know, 22,
[34:57.04]I could talk and play games all day.
[34:59.59]I could be talking about everything.
[35:00.75]So what we're going to do, guys, here is I'm coming up here.
[35:03.52]Winston, when I go through this first point, I do that because I'm making sure.
[35:06.10]I can't do that anymore.
[35:07.03]I mean, I just did it right there, but I have to stop.
[35:10.21]I'm too old.
[35:12.36]Too fucking old, man.
[35:15.63]What happens when you turn 42?
[35:26.53]Winston strat.
[35:27.38]Just jump in the air and people will think you tried to jump over them.
[35:31.90]Watch this.
[35:32.17]You ready?
[35:33.07]When somebody gets in here.
[35:36.41]I should probably go rescue these people.
[35:38.92]This room is so bright!
[35:40.66]I don't remember it being that bright.
[35:43.88]Ready Winston strat, ready?
[35:44.87]Here we go, I'm gonna jump!
[35:46.39]Just kidding, I went straight up and down.
[35:48.10]Dummy.
[35:50.51]Got ya.
[35:51.11]Fooled this guy.
[36:02.97]Straight up, straight down.
[36:14.80]42 is half of 84.
[36:16.16]Damn, that really is.
[36:18.11]That is half of 84.
[36:19.49]I'm so glad I'm not actually 42 right now.
[36:22.22]Okay, we can try to go through the window.
[36:24.07]Nope, we're dead.
[36:28.31]You don't know if you're able to meet me in person, so money's the only way to be able to feel like I'm showing appreciation.
[36:32.57]Well, think of it like this, Ranger, right?
[36:35.90]What are you doing right now?
[36:38.25]You know?
[36:39.64]You're here.
[36:42.04]You're engaging in what I'm doing right now.
[36:46.07]you're already part of the equation, you know what I mean?
[36:58.44]Come on, let me knock somebody off.
[37:02.18]No, too late for that.
[37:06.76]Ooh, that was good.
[37:07.87]That was a good ult.
[37:15.87]Are we gonna get this?
[37:18.49]Through the window.
[37:32.12]Thankfully, I think we're still gonna win.
[37:41.48]Brains from above!
[37:44.78]We're losing them all!
[37:48.10]No, that's not good.
[37:49.51]Gotta make something happen here.
[37:50.82]There's two Junkrat tires!
[37:57.57]I feel like I was just watching BattleBots.
[38:04.59]Am I doing anything?
[38:05.53]Kind of.
[38:20.84]Contest it.
[38:21.78]Contest it.
[38:24.80]Straight up.
[38:25.50]Straight down.
[38:28.82]Oh, come on!
[38:34.56]Where am I reading chat?
[38:35.64]Yeah, I have a second screen.
[38:37.35]I have two monitors.
[38:38.30]I have one 27 inch, 120 hertz in front of me.
[38:42.12]from uh Benjamin q and then to the right is like a piece of ship acer that was like 40 bucks or something
[38:50.96]Just to have like a second monitor Just gonna stand on it
[39:01.18]So like my team gets here Straight up
[39:15.11]Yeah, we lose They had a good team
[39:25.50]Play of the game.
[39:29.25]Call Winston's ult apeshit.
[39:36.94]No, it's Giga Bowser.
[39:51.98]I was going in.
[39:52.68]Where's your team?
[39:53.47]I was going in at kind of stupid times.
[39:56.42]Plus I jumped.
[39:57.49]We had like the point secured and I jumped through the window.
[39:59.96]So that's something I probably shouldn't have done.
[40:18.78]I feel nice to do it.
[40:19.44]You've done something more.
[40:22.95]Yeah, I guess.
[40:25.12]I make sense.
[40:30.57]But I'm of the type of thought process that you're already doing a lot, right?
[40:44.73]I don't wanna play.
[40:47.04]Like five years ago, right?
[40:49.06]Here you go.
[40:49.66]Five years ago, when I had like 200 subscribers,
[40:55.92]I was like, oh my God, this is crazy.
[40:57.86]There's like 200 people.
[41:00.32]Since it's grown, and since I've gotten more viewers over the years on YouTube, it's like
[41:07.92]I can't believe that I can do this and people watch.
[41:13.15]And when people say stuff like you just said, it's an odd feeling.
[41:19.83]Because I put myself in the position I was like four years ago where I just couldn't believe I was even doing it in the first place.
[41:25.71]And I'm able to like make money and have like an income from it.
[41:29.84]It's insane to me.
[41:32.03]So like you guys have already done like a huge part.
[41:42.90]I can't believe there's anybody here watching me right now.
[41:46.33]Jesus.
[41:48.62]Do you see how bad that Winston ult was?
[41:57.39]You wrote your own choose your own adventure book.
[41:58.98]I've been trying to do that for like two years now.
[42:02.77]It's a lot harder than it seems.
[42:04.50]So good luck to you.
[42:05.46]I'm glad.
[42:05.87]Did you get it done?
[42:08.46]Because I've been working on the same one off and on.
[42:10.89]Different ideas and thought processes for two years.
[42:14.69]And it's probably never coming out.
[42:16.72]Unfortunately, because I keep redoing things and keep changing how I want to start would not start it but like start different branches
[42:26.50]It's a very admirable thing, though.
[42:27.73]If you can do it, more power to you, man, because it's pretty awesome.
[42:44.76]He's right, guys.
[42:45.43]We should leave.
[42:59.02]Do you remember Rumble 4 is happening?
[43:00.47]Yes.
[43:01.57]Don't worry.
[43:03.02]Trust me.
[43:03.87]Trust me when I say do not worry.
[43:06.26]That is coming out.
[43:08.89]That's all I'm gonna say.
[43:18.63]I was hoping to get somebody peeking around the corner.
[43:25.04]Power to the players, thanks for subbing, dude.
[43:27.62]or do that.
[43:35.16]Come on, somebody sneak over here.
[43:44.68]So, that's something I just learned.
[43:47.39]You can't get the Lúcio ult when you're in the ice block.
[43:53.84]I didn't know that.
[44:08.87]This is where we get somebody in this
[44:20.36]I gotta change.
[44:23.77]No D.Va.
[44:37.89]Ratburger.
[44:39.07]That game was amazing.
[44:49.94]Holy shit, I melted.
[44:52.11]I. Melted.
[44:55.00]The portal is in the house to the right.
[44:57.61]Upstairs.
[45:07.76]I just need to skeeball this in there, seriously.
[45:19.12]Here comes the skee-ball.
[45:33.85]Wow, I just got owned right there.
[45:41.92]I just hit probably 90% of those shots.
[45:44.49]It's too bad I didn't kill him.
[45:49.23]Oh, it's so close.
[46:03.97]I'm too young to die.
[46:10.28]Yeah, I'm gonna be going to PAX East.
[46:13.99]Pretty much from here on out, it's gonna be Pax East only.
[46:21.17]Unless I have some underlying reason why I'm going to some of these things.
[46:27.78]Like, I went to BlizzCon, obviously, because this game was there, and I'm, you know, looking forward to it.
[46:33.32]But besides that, I don't know, like, PAX Prime, PAX South, it's just...
[46:38.43]I know it's a lot.
[46:41.55]But if at Pax Prime or something there's something important that's gonna be there, then yeah, I'll definitely go.
[46:47.54]But we're talking mostly PAX East.
[46:50.96]For the remainder of my internet lifestyle.
[47:09.85]Touch the point!
[47:13.72]Fuck.
[47:17.34]That's too bad.
[47:20.20]Did I just kill like three people there?
[47:34.18]Damn, that was good.
[47:42.47]Yeah, I don't even have a Paxes ticket right now.
[47:48.39]I need to find out if I can even get a badge.
[47:51.68]I always do, last minute.
[48:00.76]No, no TwitchCon.
[48:02.73]I don't do Twitch, like, enough.
[48:04.32]I'm not, like, part of the Twitch community as much as I am as, like, the YouTube community.
[48:12.46]So I would feel kind of out of place at TwitchCon.
[48:16.50]You know, oh, hey, hey, guys.
[48:17.58]Hey, yeah, I'm at TwitchCon.
[48:19.05]You know me.
[48:20.41]I stream once every three months for like a week.
[48:25.67]TwitchCon, streamer!
[48:29.52]I mean, if I keep doing it and I actually get on like a real, like I'm doing now and actually do it more than like three or four times straight in one week.
[48:40.30]Then, yeah, maybe I'd go to TwitchCon.
[48:41.49]But it would be...
[48:41.93]I don't know.
[48:42.51]I feel out of place.
[48:43.22]I don't really know... Guys, I don't really know anybody.
[48:45.19]You know what I mean?
[48:45.64]Like, I don't know anybody.
[48:48.33]There are like four people in like the YouTube and Twitch communities.
[48:52.20]Like maybe four or five of them.
[48:54.79]And you know how the conversations go when I go to like some of these events?
[48:58.12]I shake hands with them and I'm like, hey, what's up?
[49:01.03]Yeah.
[49:02.59]Alright, so you're doing the whole Twitch thing still?
[49:06.21]Yeah, cool.
[49:06.73]Yeah, cool.
[49:07.26]Good for you.
[49:08.77]I gotta go, because...
[49:11.06]We don't really know each other.
[49:15.50]Star?
[49:16.60]People always ask, why do you only make videos with Star?
[49:21.14]We get along really well and we share a lot of similar humor, I think.
[49:27.72]But he's one of the only guys I know.
[49:32.39]I mean obviously like boo stealth those like Etalyx those guys been around for years.
[49:40.27]No, no.
[49:41.72]But I'm not, like, actively going out and looking like, oh, man, like, you know what I want to do today?
[49:46.71]I want to go get a bunch of people to, like, know who I am so we can make videos together.
[49:50.26]I gotta pace up my handshaking a little, yeah?
[50:21.20]right now.
[50:22.80]Yeah, this is an Undertale run.
[50:25.47]See, I'm playing as, uh...
[50:28.49]I don't know.
[50:28.77]Who's, like, a big fat character in this one?
[50:32.76]If you consider making more YouTube videos, every day.
[50:38.48]Every single day.
[50:41.03]That's what I think about.
[50:43.03]incoming in 30 seconds.
[50:52.16]Did you hear the other day on stream he was saying you were using him for views and that you weren't friends?
[50:57.10]Did something happen?
[50:57.76]No.
[50:58.09]He just does that shit.
[51:01.21]He just says like just dumb shit all the time.
[51:09.39]He gets his rocks off by doing that sometimes.
[51:13.20]Because he can be a real dick.
[51:17.06]But he's still my friend.
[51:19.67]Alright, time for concentration mode.
[51:22.76]It's time to turn it on.
[51:23.98]We're going to do concentration mode for the next, like, five minutes.
[51:26.47]Alright, here we go.
[51:27.10]Three, two, one.
[51:27.98]Take the drugs and concentration mode begins.
[51:42.80]Reinhardt shield.
[52:04.96]He bounced me around.
[52:21.72]Doesn't even know.
[52:37.73]Is he really the only person over here?
[53:00.97]Hey, what's going on Torbjörn?
[53:13.76]Play of the week.
[53:15.97]I don't know about that.
[53:22.53]If I didn't get launched up, maybe.
[53:38.31]Ah, I've had the wrong spot.
[53:55.21]He was really salty and needed something to be...
[53:58.96]He does like this...
[54:00.03]He pretends to be angry.
[54:02.58]He does this thing where he pretends to be mad.
[54:05.62]That's like a joke that he does.
[54:16.92]Oh, I gotta get in Concentration Mode again.
[54:50.15]Ah, that was the wrong button the two close together
[55:10.82]Holy crap, that's a lot of vanilla wafers.
[55:33.86]Don't aim at the Genji.
[55:46.88]I really wish you could cancel that.
[55:48.29]I just tried to.
[55:49.13]Like, every button.
[55:52.85]Try hard mode for the rest of the stream?
[55:54.03]No.
[55:55.57]I just want to get a good game in.
[55:58.31]Where I concentrate and actually try to win the objective.
[56:02.07]Everybody just died.
[56:05.23]That blocks that?
[56:06.60]Does it really?
[56:09.55]Shut it.
[56:16.55]I just pulled him through this whole room.
[56:25.06]I pulled him over there and he went all the way around through here That was kind of insane
[56:37.53]Where's the Pharah?
[56:51.77]I had to be standing in that...
[56:58.09]The KFC board of directors are not going to be impressed.
[57:01.52]Alright, I gotta talk about that dream after this.
[57:04.94]It didn't make any fucking sense.
[57:06.75]I couldn't even put it in 140 characters how weird it was.
[57:11.04]There was way more in that dream.
[57:21.89]I'm in lots of trouble.
[57:22.86]I need to get this ult right now.
[57:24.13]Right now.
[57:26.26]Right now.
[57:35.91]We won't have a shield, that's okay with me.
[58:14.46]Armor, armor, armor.
[58:16.11]I love it.
[58:16.41]Where is it?
[58:18.14]Did somebody pick it up?
[58:19.11]Crap.
[58:31.16]No, that was a bad time to do that.
[58:32.29]Thank God he didn't charge.
[58:33.63]That would have been a guaranteed grab.
[58:53.67]Fuck, missed.
[58:55.62]He might kill me here.
[59:10.03]Only two more minutes.
[59:11.21]Come on, team.
[59:12.08]Hold out.
[59:14.49]Hold out just a little bit longer.
[59:21.97]This might be the loss.
[59:25.08]Just eat damage right now.
[59:29.29]I just got lost behind everybody.
[59:38.59]Where'd she go?
[60:07.60]Oh, come on.
[60:09.13]One minute.
[60:09.45]60 seconds.
[60:10.13]60 seconds.
[60:10.86]61 seconds.
[60:12.24]61 seconds.
[60:30.86]Anybody behind us?
[60:32.21]We're good.
[60:42.15]They went Winston.
[60:44.18]That means they're gonna go for a final push.
[60:51.92]One last push to save this potential game.
[60:55.56]Let's see if they can do it.
[60:59.73]Wouldn't do that Farah.
[61:06.46]Oh, I would have grabbed you guys.
[61:08.15]You have any idea how good that would be if I grabbed her?
[61:12.53]If he didn't put the bubble there.
[61:17.80]One of these walked off.
[61:21.76]I might get my ult too.
[61:23.42]This is gonna be tricky.
[61:24.99]There's a lot of bubbles.
[61:53.97]Oh, he died.
[61:55.11]We did it!
[61:56.97]Okay.
[61:59.10]Man, 27 eliminations with a bronze medal.
[62:01.95]Somebody must have had like 35, 40 eliminations.
[62:08.80]Alright, we had a concentration game.
[62:14.73]That was good, we won.
[62:17.91]Yeah, KFC dream story.
[62:19.11]Okay, here we go.
[62:20.57]So...
[62:21.79]I was on a bus, okay?
[62:26.16]It wasn't even supposed to be a school bus, by the way.
[62:28.41]I must have... Like, chaperoning a...
[62:31.92]High school field trip.
[62:33.44]I don't even know.
[62:34.06]I don't understand why.
[62:35.09]I was on a school bus sitting there in normal clothing.
[62:40.76]We pulled over and we got to like this meadow.
[62:45.25]It was a big...
[62:46.07]It was almost like we were going to, like, a field trip to, like, a park or something.
[62:48.97]We're, oh, yeah, we'll take a look at the...
[62:50.77]vegetation and here's like the person that's walking around pointing at stuff and saying what plant it is.
[62:56.55]That's where we were.
[62:58.99]So we're off the bus, we're walking around, and all of a sudden, I'm just in a Colonel Sanders outfit.
[63:06.61]And huge.
[63:07.23]I was like 400 pounds, by the way.
[63:09.89]My Colonel Sanders outfit was terrible.
[63:13.32]It was awful.
[63:14.33]It was like a gray wig.
[63:17.08]A vest and a gray mustache.
[63:19.67]It was not even Colonel Sanders.
[63:22.14]Not even close.
[63:23.98]There was a KFC executive just there on the field trip looking at stuff.
[63:31.00]And he was very, very much not even into the idea that I was doing.
[63:33.97]this, and I, even in my own head, I kept on, like, walking near him, like, walking around him, you know what I mean?
[63:40.56]I wasn't, like...
[63:41.54]going up in his face, but I was making sure that during this field trip when we were looking at various things that I was responding close enough for him to hear me.
[63:49.27]and in a Colonel Sanders accent.
[63:51.64]You want to hear the Colonel Sanders accent?
[63:52.86]You want to hear what it was?
[63:54.07]My Colonel Sanders accent was this.
[63:58.23]Well, now I can't.
[64:00.37]That's vegetation.
[64:01.82]Sure is big.
[64:03.67]It was that.
[64:04.73]That's not Colonel Sanders.
[64:06.23]And in my head I was like, am I doing a good Colonel Sanders?
[64:08.82]Is he impressed with me?
[64:10.43]Maybe I'll get to be like the next Colonel Sanders on TV.
[64:14.65]Oh, that's true.
[64:16.74]I love chicken.
[64:18.30]Stuff like that.
[64:18.89]Like, oh, I love the KFC bowl.
[64:21.72]For no reason.
[64:22.28]Didn't make any sense.
[64:23.46]And he was just like trying to not even have that.
[64:25.89]He was trying to just fucking avoid me.
[64:28.93]But I was trying to subtly, very subtly,
[64:33.65]just interact with them.
[64:37.34]It was really stupid.
[64:39.91]It didn't make any sense.
[64:40.84]I have no idea why.
[64:42.36]I haven't eaten KFC in like three years.
[64:46.50]I didn't see a KFC ad.
[64:51.27]It made no sense at all.
[64:53.66]Usually you can pinpoint.
[64:54.97]Okay.
[64:55.99]I saw Colonel Sanders ad on TV.
[64:57.88]I was really hungry and I had fried chicken two days ago.
[65:00.37]No.
[65:01.80]And why was I on a school bus?
[65:04.18]Why was I chaperoning a field trip?
[65:07.15]I love dreams like that because they're fucking so stupid.
[65:20.26]My favorite part about it was just in the dream I knew that I was not doing a good job.
[65:25.20]And I was self-criticizing myself in the dream.
[65:28.35]Should I raise the voice a little?
[65:29.39]Should I go a little bit higher?
[65:30.41]I would point at stuff near him and try to really make him think that I did a good Colonel Sanders.
[65:37.42]without making it obvious that I was trying to do it.
[65:40.43]It's like, you're trying to make it not obvious by subtly doing this accent near this guy.
[65:45.53]You're in a fucking Colonel Sanders outfit.
[65:52.26]I'm in what I thought was a Colonel Sanders costume.
[65:57.59]And I was trying to be subtle with my impression.
[66:04.37]So those of you that can, any psychologists in here, explain to me why that happened.
[66:19.36]But if the KFC executive was real and he had the same dream from his perspective, well, he probably would be laughing his ass off because he'd be watching
[66:27.26]a 30 year old guy with not even the right Colonel Sanders costume on.
[66:32.83]Okay, in my dream, he probably didn't even think I was doing Colonel Sanders, right?
[66:37.58]Think about it.
[66:38.33]I didn't look like him.
[66:39.67]I was like 400 pounds, and I didn't sound like him.
[66:42.36]He must have just thought I was this annoying person.
[66:44.93]Oh, yeah.
[66:46.94]It's weird how the blueberries grow on the vine like that.
[66:51.02]That's not, he probably just was like, who the fuck is this annoying fat guy that's like talking over like the guy over here.
[66:58.73]He wouldn't have even thought it was Colonel Sanders.
[67:07.28]You were once attacked by geese when you were a child.
[67:12.75]Just a weird fat botanist.
[67:20.65]That's like what I was.
[67:22.66]I wasn't even Colonel Sanders.
[67:25.97]I was trying to do Colonel Sanders.
[67:29.10]But I was just like a fucking wicked, awkward, weird, fat botanist on this field trip to that executive.
[67:38.18]Just overly interested in every piece of vegetation.
[67:44.61]Didn't even think of it like that until right now.
[68:03.46]Think I might have to change we're not in concentration mode anymore as you can tell we're in uh
[68:09.47]We're in laugh mode.
[68:12.06]We're just laughing.
[68:13.48]What are we?
[68:13.82]No, wait.
[68:19.46]I don't care.
[68:29.04]Who are going to be the next Jirama Rumble characters?
[68:31.12]You'll see.
[68:32.97]That would ruin the surprise, wouldn't it?
[68:42.81]This actually is a pretty terrible pick.
[68:45.03]Does they have a Bastion?
[69:03.30]Thought I heard something.
[69:12.48]Is he ulted?
[69:13.52]My goodness, he ulted.
[69:14.81]This Reinhardt is making things very difficult.
[69:28.71]Turn it down.
[69:36.73]Thank God this Mercy's here, because I would have died like four times now.
[69:49.35]Did I get the Bastion too?
[69:50.14]I was hoping I did.
[69:57.40]Glad he stuck around for that story.
[69:58.80]Gotta go later.
[69:59.53]Take it easy, man.
[70:06.02]I have odd dreams.
[70:08.04]My dreams always are just out of control.
[70:12.27]It's actually pretty bad.
[70:13.27]I've actually...
[70:13.97]I'm going to do a...
[70:15.86]Here's some medical knowledge for you guys.
[70:18.83]I'm going to do a sleep study soon.
[70:22.22]because I get, like, I don't know, for the last, like, couple of months especially, like, the last, like, three months...
[70:27.94]I've been like just exhausted fatigued all messed up just like no energy at all for some weird reason
[70:36.96]I get migraines.
[70:37.83]I've been getting like bad migraines.
[70:40.57]And it always relates to when I wake up, when I have a dream, every single time, I'm not kidding, this is not a joke, every single time I have a dream,
[70:50.56]I wake up with a headache.
[70:51.99]And I wake up exhausted.
[70:53.17]Like I never went to bed.
[70:55.16]This has been happening for like the last six months.
[70:58.84]I can't...
[70:59.71]I'm going in for a sleep study.
[71:00.75]They're going to see what I... What if I'm just like... Not even... What if I'm like a sleepwalker?
[71:04.74]I don't even know.
[71:05.46]That's what scares the hell out of me about a sleep study.
[71:08.60]Some dude just like staring at you while you're sleeping.
[71:11.81]What if I like scratch my balls?
[71:14.11]I don't want to do the sleep study.
[71:15.32]What if I scratch my balls?
[71:18.28]in my sleep, and I'm embarrassed about it.
[71:21.30]And that guy's just looking at me like laughing, like, did you see what he just did, Jerry?
[71:24.39]He just grabbed the ball.
[71:26.32]What an idiot.
[71:36.42]Fine, I'm gonna play that game.
[71:48.47]That's not something I want to do.
[71:56.69]Is she?
[71:59.27]Roger that.
[71:59.78]I'll take care of it.
[72:01.86]Take care of it.
[72:07.29]What the fuck?
[72:14.43]Hypothyroidism?
[72:15.93]Seriously?
[72:17.12]I got tested for hypothyroidism?
[72:19.69]With my thyroid?
[72:20.78]My thyroid was like all messed up.
[72:23.27]I guess my TSH levels were high, which means you might be hypothyroid.
[72:29.95]which would explain a lot.
[72:31.48]But then I had a second blood test, like two weeks after that blood test, and it came back pretty normal.
[72:36.52]So, I don't know.
[72:44.06]So I guess it kind of ruled that out the second time I had the blood test.
[72:48.46]Something really odd is going on.
[72:49.71]I don't know what, but I'm sure in these next few months I'll figure it out, hopefully.
[72:55.87]Because it's been a real pain in the ass.
[72:58.67]Like waking up like you never went to bed.
[73:03.71]Sucks.
[73:07.50]I'm not gonna get a good high noon with that shield.
[73:16.68]Damn turret!
[73:24.56]Yeah, there's hyper and hypo.
[73:28.17]Hypothyroid is you're not producing enough.
[73:31.22]Thyroid hormone and hyper is you're producing too much.
[73:35.11]If that is not the case, please correct me, but I'm pretty sure that's what it means.
[73:45.85]Bad place to be.
[73:58.56]It's because you literally don't go to sleep during lucid dreams.
[74:02.22]I have all my lucid... All my dreams are lucid.
[74:05.33]I like know that I'm like doing these things and I actually have like conversations in my own dream with like the character that's in the dream.
[74:14.00]You know what I mean?
[74:15.11]Like the Colonel Sanders dream, right?
[74:16.96]I was saying in the dream to myself, is he like buying this?
[74:21.11]Is he buying my impression?
[74:22.96]I didn't think I was Colonel Sanders in the dream.
[74:25.42]I was actively watching myself be Colonel Sanders and critiquing it.
[74:32.06]Unholy.
[74:32.70]The Unholy!
[74:33.97]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[74:36.59]Oh, we're back.
[74:37.46]We're back.
[74:42.67]Goddammit.
[74:48.84]That was a mistake.
[74:49.54]I should not have done that.
[74:53.64]Now what do you do for that though?
[74:58.46]If you have like constant lucid dreams, what are you supposed to do?
[75:02.55]Do they make, like, a medication?
[75:03.84]Yeah, this medication is called, uh... Anti-Dream.
[75:07.56]You don't, like, dream anymore.
[75:22.26]My god right when I press Q But that's all I need man another like disease
[75:34.21]I've been dealing with like intestinal issues.
[75:37.45]I mean, it's like pretty much totally under control at this point now, but like six years ago, man, like the last, like if you go back like a year or two, two years, maybe I'd say,
[75:46.92]two years ago till like six years ago oh my god it was fucking horrible
[75:54.41]That's not good.
[75:55.98]Oh, I'm going to change.
[75:57.00]We need some push here.
[75:58.78]I got Reinhardt.
[75:59.50]No, Winston.
[76:01.85]But man, if it turns out, if I go to the doctor and I have all these things done, these sleep studies, and it's like, oh, by the way, yeah, we're going to do this test.
[76:08.25]You have this other disease now.
[76:10.34]I'm going to be so pissed off.
[76:13.33]Because, like, the, like, colitis has just, like I said in the last couple years, gotten totally pretty much under control.
[76:21.31]It would be so fucking annoying.
[76:23.17]It was like, oh yeah, you got your, like, colitis under control.
[76:26.10]Here's fucking hyperthyroidism, dummy.
[76:30.15]Got ya.
[76:32.50]You have another set of fucking problems.
[76:41.17]I don't think we're gonna win this one.
[76:58.94]And even with colitis, man, the doctors didn't even know what I had.
[77:02.01]I was diagnosed like two different times.
[77:04.92]Three different times, actually.
[77:06.65]Well, yeah, you know, it could be colitis.
[77:08.94]Could be Crohn's.
[77:09.87]It might be Crohn's.
[77:10.83]Actually, it could be proctitis.
[77:12.46]You know, we have no fucking idea.
[77:14.33]But now we do.
[77:16.88]IBD is such an annoying disease because it can like show itself like there's like three different versions or like four different versions of the same disease.
[77:27.96]I actually just got re-evaluated.
[77:34.27]I went and I had another sigmoidoscopy done.
[77:36.32]Completely re-evaluated.
[77:38.46]And I got a different diagnosis than I got six years ago.
[77:43.04]I don't know why.
[77:43.96]I'm just talking.
[77:45.28]I thought we were just playing.
[77:47.31]No.
[77:48.03]No.
[77:53.60]Play of the game.
[78:00.43]Enjoy the lucid dreams.
[78:01.98]It's not that I don't enjoy, like, being able to lucid dream.
[78:03.99]It's just it happens too much.
[78:06.69]And I don't like it because I wake up exhausted.
[78:09.93]Like I never went to bed and it makes it hard to like do and get anything done.
[78:25.93]Do you get angry when you can't sleep?
[78:27.28]Yeah, it happened at Blizzcon.
[78:30.55]I missed the entire second day of Blizzcon.
[78:34.57]Didn't go to Blizzcon on Saturday.
[78:37.94]I missed the in tire day and night.
[78:40.99]I didn't do anything I slept in the hotel.
[78:43.84]I Was just so fucked up
[78:48.05]I was just sleeping.
[78:49.92]I flew across the whole country to come to BlizzCon.
[78:53.55]I think I might go to bed now.
[78:57.50]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[78:59.09]Ooh.
[79:02.00]Don't be currency.
[79:05.36]Ah, Reaper skin.
[79:07.10]Now it's an emote.
[79:09.85]Oh, did you see how jolly, so cool?
[79:13.04]Yeah.
[79:15.29]Oh, I have equipment.
[79:21.43]Also diet too.
[79:22.22]I've been trying to eat much better.
[79:38.76]Tough guy over here.
[79:40.09]Oh, yeah.
[79:41.08]See, he put his hands on his sides.
[79:51.00]Still looking for a game.
[79:53.80]Subway.
[79:54.19]I don't even eat Subway.
[79:54.71]I don't eat Subway.
[79:57.27]If I want like a sandwich, like an Italian sub, I go to like a Greek deli or like an Italian sub place.
[80:04.95]They do it much better.
[80:12.48]Paxies, tickets are sold out.
[80:14.99]No, I usually get a Pax badge from Machinima.
[80:19.38]That's like the network I'm in.
[80:22.60]And I say that usually by like, hopefully, like somebody will email me back at this time.
[80:29.47]Who knows, though?
[80:30.19]But it's okay.
[80:33.01]I usually go through my MCN to get a badge.
[80:39.58]What do I want to play?
[80:40.24]I mean, my stream title does say lots of Roadhog, so...
[81:01.48]Since when are you with Machinima?
[81:03.83]Since like five years ago.
[81:10.22]I don't like communicate with them at all.
[81:14.04]I got like a contract and I like renegotiated a contract with them like three years ago.
[81:20.10]And we just don't even like speak.
[81:45.63]MLG Grandpa plays Left 4 Dead 2.
[81:49.93]Yeah, I used to have like a series on Machinima's channel.
[81:53.04]Like five years ago.
[81:57.95]Yeah, I mean, I've looked at other networks, at least recently, these last six to 12 months.
[82:05.37]There's a few that I might want to join.
[82:07.41]But I don't know.
[82:08.94]I just...
[82:10.63]I don't know.
[82:12.70]Maybe I'll take a look at it again when this current contract is up.
[82:27.49]No, Machinima is just like the partner network.
[82:33.69]And I did renegotiate that contract I have with Machinima.
[82:37.28]I'm not on their old awful perpetuity contract they had for what everybody hated them for.
[82:43.68]I got out of that a long time ago.
[82:46.79]So don't worry.
[82:56.25]Did everyone just forget that I existed?
[83:03.44]Last-ditch effort.
[83:07.76]Shit, there's too many people there.
[83:08.94]Do you have to have a ticket?
[83:14.50]Yeah, you need a badge.
[83:27.70]Stop the payload.
[83:40.48]Am I getting... Contractualized?
[83:43.69]I'm not supposed... You can't, like, talk about, like...
[83:45.80]It's, like, a non-disclosure agreement.
[83:47.97]I can't, like, talk about my contract.
[83:49.58]But...
[83:50.64]Just know that I'm not on one of those old school bad machinima contracts like some people are, which is terrible that people are still on them.
[84:00.63]If it's even possible at this point.
[84:13.12]Yeah, it's definitely something I'm looking into though.
[84:18.51]Especially more recently.
[84:27.71]Are we going to do concentration mode again?
[84:29.16]I think so.
[84:30.83]We'll do another one.
[84:31.85]Let's lock in here.
[84:39.15]Holy shit, that damage boost.
[84:41.11]Point blank shot.
[84:42.00]I wonder how much that actually does.
[84:53.40]Oh, did he get stunned?
[84:55.40]What stunned him?
[84:56.07]That messed up my grab.
[84:57.51]I would have grabbed him.
[84:59.02]What happened here?
[85:02.81]What?
[85:05.19]Alright, on my screen, did he get stutter stunned by something?
[85:09.53]It looked like he did.
[85:10.19]Maybe he didn't.
[85:10.91]I'm just crazy.
[85:21.95]He's going back here.
[85:26.06]He just got pulled so weird.
[85:27.06]That guy's weird.
[85:28.03]I don't know what's going on with that guy.
[85:29.05]He got pulled in a weird spot.
[85:51.63]I don't think we're gonna win.
[85:59.38]How to manage your finances with Jerma985.
[86:02.71]That would not be a good series.
[86:08.71]That would be bad.
[86:20.02]Oh, the double jump saved him.
[86:21.71]No, it didn't.
[86:27.95]Pass HBR.
[86:41.50]Sit down.
[87:00.26]We're all animals.
[87:01.07]If I was paying more attention to the left, I probably would have got him.
[87:15.85]Ooh, we're getting beat here pretty badly.
[87:28.12]Love life advice?
[87:31.20]I'm not sure you know this, but I currently am single right now.
[87:34.66]I don't think I have very good advice for you.
[88:03.78]We going for a triple fuck right here?
[88:05.05]I think so.
[88:07.65]No!
[88:16.57]Yeah, I'm single.
[88:18.46]That's the truth.
[88:19.62]That's the long and short of it.
[88:23.16]Really?
[88:23.46]I thought that wasn't going to connect.
[88:34.37]Still Omni?
[88:36.00]Get that Discord off me.
[88:36.89]No one's going to kill me in here.
[88:44.35]No!
[88:45.15]Shit!
[88:47.18]There's the triple fuck.
[88:50.93]You're single?
[88:51.37]That's impossible.
[88:52.07]It's possible.
[88:53.19]It's very possible.
[88:56.38]You think Roadhog's gonna be nerfed hard?
[89:00.74]I don't think so.
[89:02.26]I think there are at least three or four other characters that need it before Roadhog does.
[89:11.77]I would say Zarya is probably number one that needs to be tweaked a little bit.
[89:16.11]She's insane.
[89:20.45]Sometimes it's good to vote for yourself, you know?
[89:37.99]I'm gonna play.
[89:39.69]I guess they're tweaking stuff on Play the Game, so...
[89:46.03]Jerm is single because it's part of the vampire's curse.
[89:48.39]He can't get too close to someone or else he turns to ash.
[89:52.59]That's a pretty good theory.
[89:59.73]I don't even, I mean Roadhog is, out of all the tanks, he's probably in, at the bottom somewhere.
[90:07.52]Like look, here, like the tank list.
[90:10.21]Reinhardt is, you know, the tank.
[90:13.16]Zarya is incredible.
[90:14.27]Winston is really good.
[90:15.27]Like D.Va, like he's probably number, I would say he's one of the worst tanks.
[90:19.17]He's a really good character.
[90:20.29]I think they're all balanced pretty well, except maybe her.
[90:23.09]But I think he's...
[90:24.87]In this list, I think you would not want to pick Roadhog if you could pick one of these other characters.
[90:29.89]That's what I'm saying.
[90:32.38]So that's why we're gonna pick Roadhog.
[90:39.23]I will warn them.
[90:47.80]Get some confidence.
[90:49.07]You can get any girl.
[90:50.23]I don't know.
[90:51.22]It's not about like... Not having or having not of something like confidence.
[90:56.46]It's just...
[90:57.90]I don't know man, I don't really like go out to the bars.
[91:02.52]What am I doing right now?
[91:04.89]This is what I do.
[91:07.01]I do this.
[91:08.04]I play games.
[91:08.74]I stream.
[91:09.20]I make YouTube videos.
[91:11.01]go hang out sometimes with friends and I'm not like the type of person that goes out looking you know I am ready to yeah here we go I got like a suit on ready to mingle
[91:21.00]Hey ladies, how are you?
[91:23.73]Oh, yeah, I did get this tie from Banana Republic.
[91:27.50]Thank you for noticing.
[91:28.75]Can I tell you something right now?
[91:30.78]You look very good.
[91:32.68]And that's just not me.
[91:34.60]I just don't...
[91:35.09]I don't... What's my motto?
[91:37.90]What's my motto?
[91:39.54]I don't give a shit.
[91:41.17]That's the motto, right?
[91:42.28]What does he want me to do?
[91:49.53]What did that guy want me to do?
[91:52.40]I wasn't paying attention.
[92:03.64]Alright, concentrate.
[92:04.57]This is a good team, I think.
[92:05.99]Oh my god, there's a hundred.
[92:06.88]Yeah, concentrate.
[92:10.04]Concentration mode.
[92:12.79]Concentration mode starts now.
[92:16.18]Hold on.
[92:17.01]Concentration mode starts right now.
[92:22.64]God.
[92:47.03]Look at this room.
[92:48.13]This room is like...
[92:50.30]I feel like...
[92:51.61]I can't even describe it.
[92:52.29]Never mind.
[92:52.59]Concentration mode.
[92:53.23]Am I supposed to talk?
[93:16.95]Symmetra.
[93:21.64]No, not that room of death.
[93:31.31]Stay on it, stay on it.
[93:35.14]Teleporter's on the right, in the building after the valley.
[93:44.57]Dammit.
[93:55.91]What's the...
[93:56.91]I can't... What's the first four letters of the last name of the 14th person you met on a bicycle who was roughly six feet tall?
[94:05.60]I don't remember.
[94:10.51]Anthony?
[94:12.84]Anthony?
[94:14.53]Rings a bell?
[94:28.09]Panic ult.
[94:29.27]Best ult.
[94:43.58]We got it.
[94:45.56]Good work everybody.
[94:55.78]Get that shield up.
[95:01.15]See how weird he got pulled?
[95:03.34]I pulled him and he got pulled to the right.
[95:06.05]That Reaper got pulled to the left.
[95:09.05]That was really odd.
[95:16.37]Favorite map?
[95:18.63]Um, probably Nepal.
[95:21.32]I love that map.
[95:22.37]Favorite character?
[95:22.99]You're looking at him right now.
[95:24.26]I have come to the realization that this is my favorite character in the game.
[95:29.85]Waiting for him to dash again.
[95:46.39]Nice commentary.
[95:47.11]I told you I was in Concentration Mode!
[95:49.44]It's important.
[95:50.14]Concentration Mode because I can't talk.
[95:52.69]I have to be in Concentrate.
[95:54.76]Otherwise I walk into walls.
[95:59.06]You want some commentary?
[96:00.33]Fine.
[96:00.59]Here you go.
[96:00.97]Ready?
[96:02.53]Halo's going through the course corridor here.
[96:04.00]Roadhog up top.
[96:05.38]Jerma drinks out of the juice can.
[96:07.30]Gas into his mouth.
[96:08.65]Three!
[96:09.19]We have three separate microwave ovens on the top right.
[96:12.26]Junkrat over here, shooting two bombs.
[96:14.15]Jerma gets the misses to grab because he's doing commentary and he can't really concentrate.
[96:16.85]We got a Tiki guy down here.
[96:18.64]Jerma activates his ultimate at attack 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and he gets killed by a Junkrat behind him.
[96:28.80]There you go.
[96:33.87]That's what happens.
[96:38.67]Those three easy bake ovens were the reason why I died.
[96:46.89]I had the same idea as you.
[96:51.77]What if a Roadhog gets the grab first?
[96:53.87]Usually it wins.
[96:59.17]Alright, I gotta get back to reality here.
[97:30.90]Well, thanks for the Reinhardt shield
[97:42.96]Favorite soda?
[97:44.25]Dr. Pepper.
[97:47.62]Close second is a Coca-Cola Classic out of the glass bottle.
[97:54.47]See, that could have been anybody's grab.
[97:58.21]In fact, my game freaked out because it didn't know who grabbed him first.
[98:14.03]There's just no teamwork happening.
[98:17.75]Calm down.
[98:18.23]It's just a beta.
[98:20.34]Oh.
[98:25.35]I need to help there.
[98:40.34]I not get that kill.
[98:42.59]I hit him with everything.
[98:46.56]Did he hit me seriously?
[98:47.76]What?
[98:49.84]How come his meat shots were more than my meat shots?
[98:56.50]Alright, I gotta get a good L tier.
[98:58.59]Otherwise, I'm in deep duty.
[99:06.38]No, there's nobody here.
[99:07.42]We gotta wait for the team.
[99:09.64]Okay, we got like three people here.
[99:22.86]Where is everybody?
[99:26.21]What happened?
[99:38.56]60 seconds remaining.
[99:48.18]What do we have for a team?
[99:51.08]We don't have a healer.
[99:52.45]I think that's why we're losing.
[99:59.53]I might change the healer.
[100:05.02]No one can hide from my sight.
[100:09.73]We have a healer now?
[100:13.40]Attack.
[100:14.85]No.
[100:28.36]We might actually cap it.
[100:36.02]Bouncing all over the place.
[100:54.83]Get it!
[100:55.83]Get it!
[101:15.61]Now we just have two minutes to win the game.
[101:24.70]That's a long time.
[101:25.98]We can do it.
[101:41.29]Did that Winston not die?
[101:42.48]I have no clue how the hell that happened.
[101:58.23]Why are the Jerma emotes the same word?
[102:00.17]That is a good question.
[102:09.62]Come on.
[102:10.28]Get him, Winston.
[102:11.37]Get that last blow.
[102:14.20]Somebody has to kill him.
[102:16.47]I did it.
[102:43.98]Alright, for the purposes... Ah, it's too late.
[102:47.13]Wow, we really haven't had a healer the whole game.
[102:52.70]Damn.
[102:54.16]I'm the only healer and I'm healing myself.
[103:05.24]Holy shit.
[103:10.69]Okay, I was looking over at chat.
[103:12.82]I came out of spawn.
[103:14.70]And I thought I was Winston.
[103:16.29]I looked up and tried to jump.
[103:17.39]I don't know why.
[103:27.70]I looked up like I'm gonna jump up there I don't know at first I thought I changed to Winston I guess not
[103:37.69]Look at all the healing.
[103:59.19]Box, box, give me a box, give me a box, give me a box.
[104:06.70]Good morning.
[104:08.03]Good morning.
[104:23.10]What do I want to play?
[104:28.60]One more game is Roadhog.
[104:33.92]And then we'll take it from there.
[104:41.00]So the video will be up tonight?
[104:41.98]Yeah.
[104:42.34]I just didn't finish it yesterday.
[104:46.24]I got too tired actually and I was at the last like 20 minutes of making it and I was just like, I'm just gonna do it tomorrow.
[105:05.90]95.
[105:20.98]Estimated time, zero seconds.
[105:25.61]What meal do you make when you're sitting in your underwear and can't be bothered to make anything?
[105:29.93]Hard boiled eggs.
[105:31.19]We talked about this yesterday.
[105:34.00]That is the ultimate lazy food.
[105:36.19]You just make them on Monday and you can just be a weasel and eat eggs.
[105:43.83]That's what I do.
[105:44.78]You just turn into a little weasel.
[105:49.29]You just grab the whole egg and just like mash it into your mouth.
[105:54.21]Eat like two or three of those and then... Glass of like orange juice or something, you're done.
[106:00.73]The ultimate lazy man food.
[106:14.77]I can't have more than one hard-boiled egg.
[106:16.37]I get real gassy.
[106:21.28]So that's what you gotta find.
[106:22.29]You gotta find your egg tolerance.
[106:27.56]Some people have a better egg tolerance than others.
[106:39.32]See, I have at least like a two to three a day egg tolerance.
[106:47.23]Come the fuck on!
[106:48.97]I'm so mad at myself for not getting that last hit on him.
[107:02.42]I got it.
[107:04.06]How did he still have that little health?
[107:06.33]Maybe I didn't do it.
[107:07.43]Maybe somebody else.
[107:08.07]He healed and somebody else did it.
[107:10.22]Get back on the cart.
[107:15.72]Check my cholesterol.
[107:18.01]Uh, cholesterol.
[107:18.93]There's the... You know, there's new research out there.
[107:23.19]The cholesterol in eggs is really not as much of a sin as everybody thinks it is.
[107:33.23]Watch out for the dog.
[107:38.09]Saturated fat is arguably worse than cholesterol these days.
[107:48.02]Damn it.
[107:54.01]Do you like the hard-boiled egg?
[107:55.44]Yeah, I'll explain what I do to it.
[107:58.11]If you want the perfect, perfect hard-boiled egg...
[108:03.09]Here's what you do.
[108:04.34]Take the hard boiled egg.
[108:05.96]Take a salt shaker.
[108:08.37]That's it.
[108:11.08]Take some pepper.
[108:12.27]Grab the pepper shaker.
[108:14.78]That's it.
[108:16.10]And then what you want to do is you want to go to the store and you want to get a green Tabasco.
[108:19.46]Not the red Tabasco, the green Tabasco.
[108:21.35]It's really important.
[108:23.52]And then what you do with the green Tabasco is eat that egg, and you tell me that that was not something that you'd want to do every day.
[108:33.09]Why did I just do that?
[108:35.45]We have a healer, and I had full health.
[108:37.78]I'm gonna say it was an accident.
[108:48.97]Where the fuck is everybody?
[108:51.63]What just hit me?
[108:52.98]I was hit by a phantom.
[109:00.44]And where's all this coming from now?
[109:04.24]There's like three people in that room.
[109:05.74]You get that health pack, it's more important.
[109:09.66]We're going to drop down an ult.
[109:12.91]We're going to wait for the opportunity.
[109:14.02]The opportunity is right...
[109:24.90]Well, I did a lot of denial.
[109:37.72]I would have grabbed him.
[109:41.06]I would have grabbed him.
[109:49.77]He wants that health pack.
[109:51.14]He got it.
[109:57.31]He got away.
[109:58.85]You bastard.
[110:07.83]Tire dead?
[110:11.63]Tire gone?
[110:20.40]I can ult into that room and hopefully kill everything.
[110:23.54]That'd be a plus, wouldn't it?
[110:29.76]Hi Winston.
[110:36.24]And this is where we drink and we ultimate.
[110:47.60]Done deal.
[110:52.43]That's a done deal, ladies and gents.
[111:06.97]the other way?
[111:08.00]He didn't.
[111:08.34]He's not drinking, he's inhaling.
[111:15.60]It's funny, it's funny, it's funny
[111:23.41]stay on it stay on it
[111:41.43]Hey, I went for a ride and I got him.
[111:47.81]Stay out of the bubble
[111:54.59]I almost have my ultimate, too.
[111:55.60]We can turn this corner and I can watch out for that.
[112:00.21]He's dead.
[112:06.09]Fuck screwed that one up
[112:20.21]Keep him away from everybody.
[112:26.63]Am I done with Undertale?
[112:27.98]Pretty much, yeah.
[112:35.31]Oh, God.
[112:41.56]Roadhog needs a giant baby skin?
[112:43.89]Oh yeah, I would absolutely buy that.
[112:47.74]Just a huge diaper and a bonnet and everything.
[112:50.25]That'd be amazing.
[112:57.34]It's a baby bottle that he takes?
[112:59.10]Yeah, that would be amazing.
[113:02.27]I would love every second of that.
[113:06.72]I'm gonna grab this guy off the ledge
[113:11.88]What the fuck just happened?
[113:12.85]What happened?
[113:13.17]What happened?
[113:13.68]I got him!
[113:15.33]They even made like the you got him thing.
[113:20.12]Was not cool.
[113:24.89]What the fuck was that?
[113:25.84]What the hell is happening?
[113:28.16]I just pulled that guy into a magnet in the wall.
[113:38.49]How is he on the other team?
[113:42.79]Has he been on the other... What?
[113:45.58]Has he been on the other team the whole time?
[113:50.73]When did that happen?
[113:52.00]Have I been playing against Star this entire game?
[114:06.62]Just trying to keep him away so people can get on him.
[114:09.05]There we go.
[114:11.86]The current game is Undertale.
[114:21.47]I just have an updated Nightbot.
[114:27.14]It's just Undertale.
[114:28.91]It's just always Undertale for me.
[114:37.69]I wasn't playing against him the whole time.
[114:46.25]That's a lot of assists.
[114:52.42]excellent yeah I was gonna say that I would have noticed you were in that game way before that
[115:01.47]What are you doing?
[115:02.11]Are you playing or are you soloing?
[115:03.80]What do you want to do?
[115:04.48]You want to play?
[115:07.66]It's up to you.
[115:08.18]You can do whatever you want.
[115:09.97]You can solo if you want.
[115:14.23]I do have to pee though.
[115:15.75]So I'll be back in like a minute or two.
[115:18.29]Give me two seconds.
[117:54.82]Thank you.
[118:07.82]Thank you.
[118:31.19]Hey.
[118:42.67]Am I in the voice channel?
[118:46.67]You want to talk out here or you want to talk in the talk talk?
[118:53.13]Now arriving at Nidong Power.
[118:57.79]You want to talk in here or you want to talk in the talk talk?
[119:04.27]Did he say anything?
[119:09.93]No.
[119:10.01]Maybe he just wants to play.
[119:11.66]That's okay.
[119:18.15]Justice ain't gonna dispense itself.
[119:40.14]Is he here?
[119:40.75]Where is he?
[119:52.58]You know, sometimes you just don't take a game in.
[119:54.91]You know what I mean?
[119:55.71]Let's take in what's on this table.
[119:58.26]Blue chairs.
[119:59.75]Four screws.
[120:01.88]Napkin holder, plenty of napkins in there.
[120:04.89]What's in there, what is that?
[120:07.45]Couple of pies, three apple pies.
[120:12.88]I wanted that.
[120:14.91]And a couple of some diffusers.
[120:17.88]That is a vanilla scent diffuser.
[120:21.61]What's on this table?
[120:23.83]A couple of baskets.
[120:25.56]More scent diffusers.
[120:28.15]Come over here, napkin.
[120:30.94]No, somebody didn't pick up after themselves.
[120:33.58]Look at this.
[120:33.93]This is trash.
[120:37.62]What is up with that?
[120:45.53]No.
[121:11.77]Hello?
[121:20.30]Can you hear me now?
[121:35.20]Well, if he could hear me, he absolutely would be able to.
[121:37.45]So, I don't know.
[121:39.47]I just tried to change channels like three times.
[121:59.17]Who's he talking to right now?
[122:01.09]Rooting for you.
[122:05.77]American Fun Shoot Mania?
[122:07.76]Oh god, that's a long time ago.
[122:13.53]That was a very long time ago.
[122:21.48]Hey, there he is.
[122:22.21]Hi.
[122:26.71]Winston and Heather are all going up there, I guess.
[122:33.97]Is that a sniper?
[122:35.94]Oh, damn.
[122:40.34]Where is that sniper?
[122:41.66]Jeez.
[122:46.90]Is it up top?
[122:47.85]Yeah, she's up there, isn't she?
[123:00.21]Damn it.
[123:01.10]Damn it.
[123:02.02]Hide behind the telephone booth.
[123:05.24]Yeah, just like Superman.
[123:06.71]Fuck.
[123:18.50]Well, they might get it.
[123:22.23]Different shades of emotes.
[123:36.02]Jeez, uh, I think it's time for a change of plan here I'm getting insta killed
[123:46.96]Justice for you.
[123:52.27]Yeah, Roadhog is too big to hide behind the telephone booth.
[123:56.23]He's, like, gigantic.
[123:58.39]It worked, though.
[123:59.14]That did work for about five seconds.
[124:06.97]We're gonna have to go Reinhardt though.
[124:13.86]Where is that sniper?
[124:23.68]Where is the team?
[124:26.69]Starz is like the only person over here.
[124:36.57]Shield is going down
[124:49.78]I don't know where the hell he's going.
[124:57.91]Jeez.
[124:59.82]I was not getting out of that one.
[125:03.42]They were all just like swarming me like a bunch of vultures.
[125:14.92]How much cheese do I eat?
[125:15.95]Actually, speaking of cheese, I found something at the store.
[125:18.36]My mother actually found it when she gave it to me.
[125:20.90]It's a bag of these cheese crisps.
[125:24.48]And they're not crackers.
[125:25.72]It is legit 100% baked Parmesan cheese.
[125:29.16]That's it.
[125:30.16]in these little circles.
[125:32.43]They're crazy.
[125:33.12]They're amazing.
[125:35.21]You're supposed to put them on salads, but I kind of just eat them out of the bag.
[125:40.21]So it's sort of gross.
[125:44.22]But they're delicious.
[125:45.23]That's really important.
[125:47.91]For you to know that.
[125:48.75]Tidbit of information.
[125:53.28]Shield get to at least a thousand Cheese
[126:03.98]Everybody loves cheese.
[126:06.46]Who doesn't like cheese?
[126:11.05]Trying to eat better.
[126:11.99]That's not terrible for you.
[126:13.94]It's just like, parmesan cheese is barely anything.
[126:17.75]They're small, too.
[126:18.48]They're not huge.
[126:21.09]They're little dollops.
[126:22.78]They're really crunchy, they're really tasty.
[126:28.25]They're good.
[126:31.42]Highly recommend them.
[126:32.88]I'm gonna die.
[126:33.41]I need healing.
[126:38.85]We have Lúcio, right?
[126:45.46]Or do we?
[126:47.23]Oh shit, we don't have anything for heals.
[126:52.70]I would have just ulted right there, but I don't have any health and I wanted to make sure I didn't die instantly after doing it.
[127:01.24]probably gonna die here yeah cheese and cheese and jam sandwiches
[127:11.99]I mean, I've heard of people pairing like grapes and cheese, wine and cheese.
[127:16.18]Are we talking like strawberry jam?
[127:24.49]That's kind of... That's kind of the odd thing, isn't it?
[127:34.33]Who's the most annoying character in the game?
[127:37.83]In my opinion it's Zarya.
[127:42.92]I think everybody has their least favorite character, but I think Zarya is my absolute least favorite character to play against.
[127:51.56]She seems to be able just to do everything.
[127:53.91]She can do a shitload of damage, she can live forever, she can protect other people.
[127:58.10]She's kind of the best of everything.
[128:06.88]And... Nope.
[128:10.64]Thought about it.
[128:14.66]I need to use this ult, but it's not really an opportunity to do it yet.
[128:19.58]Maybe like right now.
[128:23.76]Are you serious?
[128:25.77]Are you fucking serious?
[128:28.92]I did like the full animation.
[128:32.36]My hammer was on the ground.
[128:34.59]The axe was on the ground.
[128:38.00]And on his screen, my axe had barely even moved up over my body.
[128:43.03]You like to call that dog shit?
[128:51.43]Come on, I got launched.
[128:59.63]What happened here?
[129:00.81]Oh, he's healthed behind me.
[129:07.56]Wow, we are not...
[129:08.99]It's not over.
[129:12.77]It's not over yet.
[129:19.49]It's not over until the fat lady sings, as they say.
[129:30.24]We still don't have a healer.
[129:33.88]That's been kind of a pattern these last few games, hasn't it?
[129:49.92]Congregating in this room.
[129:51.63]Let's go for a charge.
[129:59.99]He's still alive.
[130:03.89]I charged him and swung at him.
[130:06.36]And he didn't die.
[130:07.40]Did he run off the health pack?
[130:12.68]I might actually go Mercy right here.
[130:16.15]After I do this ult.
[130:19.50]because we desperately need it.
[130:22.03]Desperately, desperately, desperately.
[130:33.17]Give me that ult.
[130:37.08]Where's this Pyro?
[130:43.51]That's not a good look.
[130:56.95]If that bubble wasn't there I would have probably hit like two or three of them
[131:02.85]No!
[131:04.20]Oh that was so, so close.
[131:09.05]The three of them that was sitting in that room would have gotten hit by that if that bubble didn't happen the second I pressed Q.
[131:16.25]Fucking god dang, dang it, dang it.
[131:25.89]This is why I don't play Reinhardt.
[131:33.89]I want to play like the characters I'm good at.
[131:39.37]But I'm forced to play these characters.
[131:41.80]Because nobody else will do it.
[131:47.00]Give me that upvote.
[132:03.77]You're good at characters, Jerma.
[132:05.13]Laugh at me.
[132:05.47]Don't laugh at me.
[132:06.98]Don't laugh at me.
[132:10.12]That's from a movie, right?
[132:12.45]Don't laugh at me.
[132:14.24]Why is everybody laughing at me?
[132:15.30]What is it from?
[132:30.32]I'm not playing a tank.
[132:36.85]I'm going to play Junkrat.
[132:41.57]I gotta get in the, uh, in the, whoops, wrong button.
[132:44.97]That's not the button I wanted to press.
[132:49.53]Where is it?
[132:49.85]There it is.
[132:56.27]Where is it?
[132:56.67]There it is.
[132:58.65]Got it.
[132:59.86]Hey.
[133:01.97]Hey.
[133:04.35]Okay, it's Jarmo who doesn't remember people.
[133:07.05]What?
[133:07.25]What are you talking about?
[133:09.10]You didn't make the connection, the Shootmania connection.
[133:13.32]Yeah, I did.
[133:14.44]Oh.
[133:15.85]I heard you talking on your stream, but it didn't sound like you got it.
[133:18.33]All I heard you say was, that's a long time ago.
[133:20.50]I said, who is he talking to?
[133:21.55]And I scrolled up and I said, shoot Manny.
[133:23.14]And I was like, oh yeah, that was a long time ago.
[133:26.06]Yeah.
[133:27.76]We didn't have a healer that whole game until you win Zenyatta for the final 14 seconds.
[133:31.41]There was a Zenyatta, but I think near the end, I don't know when he did, but I think he went Hanzo.
[133:36.52]Had I known he switched, I'd have been Zenyatta for a long time.
[133:39.89]I got denied so hard on like two ults.
[133:43.72]That Winston denied the hell out of me, especially at the end there.
[133:46.36]And I got really mad and I screamed on stream.
[133:48.75]People were like, whoa, dude, Jeremy's fucking screaming!
[133:52.28]Yeah, that must have been a really... Must have been a really, you know...
[133:57.27]You know, I've actually heard from quite a few people that you had kind of a meltdown.
[134:02.25]I had a meltdown?
[134:04.17]You had a meltdown on stream.
[134:05.30]What happened?
[134:06.20]Did I?
[134:07.11]What did I do?
[134:08.21]People were saying you were really angry.
[134:09.98]I had multiple.
[134:11.11]Which one?
[134:12.51]I'm just going by what people have been saying.
[134:14.82]Angry about what?
[134:15.44]I don't know.
[134:16.67]I was angry that I picked Lúcio by accident for a second.
[134:22.38]That's about it.
[134:24.10]Okay, we have a Lúcio.
[134:29.05]Are you all ready for the inevitable salt?
[134:30.63]No, it's not going to happen.
[134:32.40]I mean, we're just playing against Quake pros.
[134:34.35]That's all.
[134:34.69]It's not going to happen.
[134:35.55]Don't worry.
[134:36.56]No, I'm...
[134:39.45]Retired CS pro.
[134:40.84]It's okay, Jeremiah.
[134:42.75]I don't know anybody else.
[134:49.37]Uh, Boo wants to play too.
[134:52.62]Oh wow, we're gonna have a whole crew.
[134:57.93]Fucking tryhards.
[135:16.92]I kinda wanna, did you get her?
[135:19.01]Oh, you got her.
[135:30.02]So scared of being over here.
[135:33.14]Oh, they have a teleporter back there.
[135:34.95]Where is it?
[135:36.61]In the library, uh, the cafe thing, you know?
[135:41.66]I don't know what it is.
[135:48.65]I was going for a quick ult there.
[135:50.22]Hopefully, maybe I could get like two people in the room, but he was fanning when I went in.
[136:04.60]A lot of people there.
[136:05.64]Is that Sniper?
[136:16.17]Oh, that was two direct hits and she's not dead.
[136:22.91]I'm not even sure how that's possible.
[136:36.02]I'm going through this room.
[136:37.98]I'm going to kill the Symmetra, hopefully.
[136:40.29]Oh, she's already dead.
[136:41.68]Who's left?
[136:43.70]Anybody over here?
[136:47.00]No, there's no brakes.
[137:00.91]at him.
[137:12.10]That's a good spot.
[137:17.92]Holy shit, there's so many people there.
[137:29.12]Oh whoops.
[137:31.94]Every time I put down a mine and I die, and then I get a chance to detonate it inside a spawn...
[137:39.53]I'm always just hoping it's gonna kill like three people because of the weird spot that it's in.
[137:45.48]You know what I'm saying, Star?
[137:49.03]Well, who the fuck is behind us?
[137:53.04]Oh, she's up top, behind.
[137:54.02]She's like in the building with the arch.
[137:57.15]I knew there was somebody behind us, too.
[137:58.38]I just didn't know where the hell she was.
[138:04.11]Well, that's a five.
[138:05.07]How do you do?
[138:11.36]for 34 minutes and 30 seconds we can do it right so do you know why they took out
[138:18.04]the point capture thing at the top?
[138:21.28]Like the actual...
[138:22.51]I swear to God, wasn't it there before?
[138:31.59]Alright.
[138:48.18]I have a feeling you muted.
[138:49.41]Oh, I accidentally muted.
[138:50.45]I knew it.
[138:50.95]I knew it.
[138:51.68]I knew it.
[138:52.64]I did, yeah.
[138:53.99]I've been saying a lot of shit.
[138:55.88]That was very relevant.
[138:57.42]I called the sniper up in the arches about a minute before you died.
[139:00.54]Are you serious?
[139:01.67]Well, thanks for the call outs, dude.
[139:14.17]I called, I called a lot of really important things.
[139:19.07]They would have been nice if we could hear it.
[139:20.28]I tested to see if my mic worked, and I was like, oh shit, like for some reason my mic isn't working.
[139:23.77]Ready?
[139:25.62]I'm going to get somebody.
[139:27.87]Come on.
[139:28.73]Come on.
[139:31.82]I hit someone.
[139:47.46]I'll just play with it.
[140:01.94]People are getting launched everywhere.
[140:04.94]What the hell was that?
[140:08.78]Not muted.
[140:10.37]Okay, it's coming to the song.
[140:13.28]No!
[140:17.08]I was like one second off from hitting that guy.
[140:20.09]I knew they were coming in a second too early.
[140:25.48]I think we're gonna win.
[140:33.13]I think we're doing okay.
[140:42.95]Here comes
[140:54.17]Will you stop doing that?
[140:59.26]Oh, there's the sun.
[141:01.39]No, it's just there's the annoying guy making like throw up noises.
[141:05.80]That's what you sound like when you throw up.
[141:08.65]Kind of.
[141:10.84]I can't think about it, really.
[141:29.83]And you're gonna die when you come out of that, sorry.
[141:34.78]Okay, that was odd.
[141:38.11]Teleporter's behind the thingies.
[141:40.63]Behind the thingies.
[141:41.19]You got it.
[141:43.23]I'm dragoning it.
[141:53.38]And I'll just .
[141:55.01]Oh, come on, really?
[142:00.20]I'll just go over it.
[142:06.31]Stalling that last play.
[142:08.02]Jump in the hole, quick.
[142:09.32]Jump in the hole and die, quick.
[142:10.07]Come on.
[142:13.14]Ugh.
[142:19.95]Remember when you were muted accidentally?
[142:23.46]I was celebrating the win!
[142:28.25]You won a game with me.
[142:31.61]Don't forget this.
[142:33.33]Yeah, usually it's pretty hard.
[142:37.65]Nidhogg?
[142:39.64]Like the game?
[142:40.37]Is that the guy that made Nidhogg?
[142:44.18]Well, his name is Nidhogg.
[142:45.48]I mean, that's his name.
[142:48.84]What's up, folks?
[142:49.84]Hey, Boo.
[142:52.70]Let's play Overwatch.
[142:57.51]I got really confused.
[142:58.47]I had to stream on it.
[143:00.32]So I just had you both talking at the same time.
[143:02.89]Yeah, we're streaming on twitch.tv.
[143:05.04]Yeah, Twitch.television there.
[143:07.23]twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[143:10.87]You want to write it down so I can say it a little bit slower for you?
[143:15.27]985.
[143:18.64]Welcome, Boo.
[143:21.19]Everyone's like, Boo is here.
[143:24.07]Are they all saying Ed Boo's in the call?
[143:25.88]They're like, fuck yeah, welcome Boo.
[143:28.38]I love Boo.
[143:33.08]Alright, let's...
[143:35.01]Did you just mute?
[143:36.47]You're like, alright.
[143:38.54]Alright, let's, okay.
[143:39.24]Alright, let's get it.
[143:45.65]Boys are back in town.
[143:48.39]That's where we are.
[143:50.70]The boys?
[143:51.36]The boys are back in town.
[143:56.59]Now I'm excited, man.
[143:57.53]We got like three people.
[144:00.04]It's more than two.
[144:05.84]Ooh, hold on, I gotta tell you something.
[144:07.54]Stand over here.
[144:08.58]It's important.
[144:11.01]Hold on.
[144:11.97]You wait for the spam filter.
[144:13.70]Okay, I'm ready.
[144:14.80]Uh, stand on the X.
[144:17.97]Oh, it didn't come through again.
[144:20.46]Somebody has to do it to me.
[144:21.43]I have to do it?
[144:23.36]Go away, let me practice.
[144:24.38]Okay, Star, you have to do that, but you have to make it extremely, extremely known that you're talking.
[144:29.31]And perfect.
[144:30.66]Don't talk over there, Boo.
[144:39.01]Alright, let's see it
[144:45.85]If it, if it lives, I could kill it.
[144:54.39]I hope you enjoyed that, um, those jokes there.
[145:00.11]I'm glad I got the same guys, dude.
[145:02.67]A couple of the same.
[145:06.02]It's okay.
[145:06.34]We have Nidhogg on our team.
[145:13.91]Oh, we're doing that thing where we just face off against super high MMR people.
[145:19.33]Yeah, I hear Jerma says Nepal's his favorite map.
[145:21.16]I wonder who he fucking copied with that opinion.
[145:23.58]Oh, did you read that on Ster.website?
[145:25.47]Did you make another blog post?
[145:29.58]No, I didn't.
[145:33.45]No, the Paul is just oh, yeah, let's we win what a drummer we win.
[145:39.49]Are you playing Zara?
[145:41.84]I win
[145:45.20]It's not that easy.
[145:48.75]Who are you playing, Boo?
[145:51.10]Boo, you have four seconds, Boo.
[145:53.38]Alright, let's go.
[145:55.85]I'm trying to pick a healer who I don't hate.
[145:58.85]I know, it's hard, right?
[146:00.38]I know Lúcio's the best pick, but I hate playing Lúcio.
[146:03.47]I'm awful with the gun.
[146:04.70]I know, right?
[146:05.40]Well, you kind of need Lúcio, because look how slow we're getting on the point, man.
[146:08.84]Concentration mode activated in 3, 2, 1, go.
[146:14.29]When is Xayah and Zenyatta gonna get all the Need for Speed?
[146:20.03]Oh, I'm dead.
[146:23.84]Okay, thanks, guys.
[146:29.95]Thanks to a sonar I got that I got to see that in the kill came would you get to see
[146:36.83]I'm all standing under the arch as I walk forward in mid-space.
[146:41.19]I had to charge up my ability to play the game, don't you know?
[146:50.23]oh that's not cool
[147:02.23]I'm fine.
[147:04.70]I'm playing Zarya.
[147:13.44]Roadhog rides again.
[147:18.56]You ice walled.
[147:19.32]You ice walled me.
[147:22.65]I would have grabbed her.
[147:23.85]He got me with an ice ball.
[147:32.23]He's going up top, top left.
[147:35.22]Oh, come on.
[147:35.76]Stop doing that to me.
[147:37.33]Or I rage.
[147:49.75]Damn it.
[147:57.20]Kill us both.
[147:59.79]And that's what I'm talking about, speed boost.
[148:09.48]I actually missed that, but it doesn't matter.
[148:11.30]I killed most of them.
[148:13.15]At least you did.
[148:14.39]I think we'll get it straight back.
[148:16.08]We're gonna get it.
[148:17.06]Don't worry.
[148:20.31]She wants to die?
[148:21.69]What killed her?
[148:23.00]I think she tripped over.
[148:39.21]See ya!
[148:41.41]Great sir, have a good one.
[148:53.29]Oh, Reaper behind.
[148:54.99]One point.
[148:57.72]Where'd it go?
[148:58.72]Just one heal?
[148:59.61]One heal?
[149:00.15]One guy?
[149:11.26]Nice work guys.
[149:19.64]Don't patronize me.
[149:23.64]That was a team effort.
[149:35.69]Oh, that's the same one I have.
[149:37.32]I like that one.
[149:38.16]It is a good one.
[149:38.93]Because look at it.
[149:39.71]Confirmed.
[149:41.08]Why is this not on Reddit?
[149:42.26]Oops.
[149:42.68]Confirmed.
[149:43.27]Oh, God.
[149:43.71]That's Roadhog's face.
[149:46.02]Don't people wanna know what he looks like?
[149:49.27]No.
[149:51.34]Come on, that's some data mining shit right there.
[149:53.85]What does he look like behind the mask?
[149:55.15]He's a pig.
[149:56.78]I just data mined it.
[150:11.72]Old range racer.
[150:23.04]Has anyone noticed yet which team has the Zarya on it?
[150:26.45]Where'd she go?
[150:27.37]I think I turned her on.
[150:37.03]Tracer, you're annoying.
[150:38.20]Ooh, she got ice.
[150:42.48]Tracer, right?
[150:47.36]Holy shit.
[150:49.01]I'm ulting the absolute crap out of everybody.
[150:54.29]I'm gonna chase him down.
[150:55.19]He thinks he's gonna get away.
[151:01.06]Holy shit, he ulted.
[151:02.37]Move, run.
[151:03.59]I can't up-pint.
[151:05.48]All my life.
[151:12.05]Whoops.
[151:12.81]I died.
[151:13.21]I died though.
[151:16.29]It's okay.
[151:17.13]We get 40 percentile.
[151:18.80]Oh, Jesus.
[151:23.86]I'm gonna wait.
[151:25.05]I'm the only person that's standing over here.
[151:26.58]I'm gonna wait for the T-E-A-M.
[151:37.68]Didn't actually hit her with that spread.
[151:41.51]I would rather poop my pants every day than miss that.
[151:45.34]Of course I would
[152:00.72]KILL!
[152:03.59]Holy god!
[152:06.72]All that hitscan is all over my body.
[152:16.70]Just got my first ever 12 in Arena in Hearthstone.
[152:20.84]Congratulations, dude.
[152:21.69]That's a huge thing.
[152:23.28]I've only done that one time, and it was with Boo's help.
[152:26.22]Boo pretty much played the game through my screen.
[152:36.39]reaper's behind us a lot of people behind us like someone doesn't want to win
[152:45.86]That guy could have absolutely killed me.
[152:50.63]And he did.
[152:51.34]I don't know why he didn't try to shoot me once or twice after that.
[153:02.55]Roadhog hooking looks super satisfying it is.
[153:04.70]It's a ton of fun.
[153:12.43]Yes.
[153:15.40]Can I stop dropping the beat for once?
[153:20.70]I missed one.
[153:21.54]I'm dead.
[153:29.83]I mean, I stood on it.
[153:33.95]It's alright.
[153:34.30]We wouldn't want to lose one.
[153:40.04]I'm not muted again, am I?
[153:41.59]No, you're muted.
[153:42.67]Okay, good.
[153:43.21]Alright.
[153:45.68]Alright, alright, alright.
[153:49.76]I would change up Roadhog, but it does say in the title that I'm playing Roadhog, so I have to stay on Roadhog.
[153:54.56]That's fair enough.
[153:56.06]Well, no, we got a Winston.
[153:57.07]We're fine.
[153:57.83]We'll do a Genji stream.
[154:00.73]Do a Genji stream?
[154:02.40]Yeah.
[154:02.84]No way.
[154:05.20]Out of all the characters in this whole game, that's the character I probably am the worst with.
[154:09.89]When I play Genji, I miss every single hit, every shot, every shuriken and die.
[154:16.64]I think Lúcio's my worst character, which is really saying something, considering you just kind of stand in the vicinity of teammates.
[154:23.95]Can someone go on the point?
[154:25.30]Boo, just go on.
[154:29.84]Thank you.
[154:33.00]It was worth it.
[154:36.90]Xayah's shield is quite good.
[154:38.65]Oh, I thought you died.
[154:39.41]I don't know.
[154:42.06]Just trying to pick people off.
[154:45.28]Reap is coming in.
[154:46.85]I would have hooked him too.
[154:48.64]He's raised.
[154:51.31]Ringwraith!
[154:52.11]Ringwraith!
[154:52.53]Ringwraith!
[154:53.45]Oh shit, a ringwraith.
[154:57.09]Is that supposed to be some kind of ringwraith impression there?
[155:00.72]Ooh, we got the bastions set up.
[155:02.97]That's actually pretty sick at this point.
[155:04.90]I'm going to stick with him and shield them up.
[155:09.60]Ooh, we got it.
[155:13.51]Shield him up.
[155:15.81]I'm ready to waste my ult.
[155:32.18]Damn, he actually got him Wow Is he ulting right now?
[155:39.41]He is ulting right now
[155:43.15]That is what we call crap.
[155:48.17]I'm going to wire run your channel.
[155:54.42]Hey, Etalyx.
[155:55.03]We're streaming.
[155:56.32]Oh, I know.
[155:58.15]I was just wondering which one of you gentlemen has the insider information on when the biggest wave ever
[156:05.15]Is it really?
[156:10.33]No.
[156:11.54]But you should know this.
[156:13.19]Alright, I'm gonna say if it's gonna happen, it'll happen probably at like 1 or 2 Eastern.
[156:24.10]Roadhog behind us, right?
[156:25.63]It is Tuesday, after all.
[156:28.89]Alright.
[156:32.54]You know what that means.
[156:33.73]There was no wave last week.
[156:35.30]Help me.
[156:36.23]Help me.
[156:36.41]Unless you're in Asia.
[156:39.41]And that doesn't count.
[156:40.35]What time is it right now?
[156:41.05]No way.
[156:41.82]What time is it right now?
[156:43.43]It's almost 1 PM Central.
[156:45.48]If they were going to do a wave, it would probably happen within the next hour or two, I would say.
[156:55.18]Did they get it?
[156:57.82]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[157:06.90]I saw that.
[157:12.47]Watch this.
[157:14.08]just happened oh my god that was so clutch that was incredible that's why we won the game right now
[157:20.83]Wait, did we win?
[157:21.80]Oh, absolutely.
[157:22.91]Three people died right there.
[157:24.16]That was perfect.
[157:29.98]Apparently I made, like, 10 or 15 people immediately check their email for invites.
[157:36.00]Damn it, Winston.
[157:37.72]I almost just didn't make that jump.
[157:46.96]Come on, get him off.
[157:51.88]That was a big old cooldown on his right click, whoops.
[157:55.18]No, come on, don't let him get it.
[157:58.75]This is such a good game.
[158:01.90]Come on.
[158:03.22]Leaked in the pit.
[158:04.33]We got it.
[158:05.37]Yeah, good job.
[158:09.49]I like fashion on that point
[158:13.13]means I have to come to him instead of the point.
[158:15.92]Yeah.
[158:17.97]Play of the game.
[158:19.18]Oh, please tell me it has to be, right?
[158:27.71]Yep, it is.
[158:35.80]That was amazing.
[158:37.97]I loved it.
[158:38.97]I loved it.
[158:40.08]Boo, you doing some Lúcio practicing?
[158:42.83]Yeah.
[158:44.68]Guy sucks.
[158:46.27]You don't sound too excited.
[158:49.01]No, it's because I...
[158:52.43]I don't like you.
[158:53.40]Is this what happened?
[158:54.76]Guys, there's no healer on this team.
[158:56.93]And then you're like, I guess I'll pick Lúcio.
[158:59.49]Well, I was Zenyatta for one life and then I switched.
[159:02.82]Yeah, exactly.
[159:06.33]Almost time for a box.
[159:19.31]Salty, what are you talking about?
[159:22.65]There's a thousand and one Dalmatians in here.
[159:25.87]Really?
[159:26.95]Yeah.
[159:28.87]Well we're playing with the video game Nidhogg, did you see that?
[159:33.64]Is that the one where you stab things?
[159:35.57]Yeah, we're playing with the actual game.
[159:37.80]Yeah, with the Destreza.
[159:39.68]That probably actually means something.
[159:44.63]Guys have a Lady 8, god damn.
[159:48.11]Nidhogg is the dragon that eats you at the end of the level.
[159:52.00]In Norse mythology.
[159:53.15]I'll play Zenayada.
[159:55.14]Felt a bit different though, I think, with all the Norse shit going on.
[160:03.66]And be sold to 76 upon the duty.
[160:06.37]This fun fact brought to you by SBS.
[160:09.47]The Star Broadcasting Service.
[160:12.12]Paid for in part by...
[160:14.61]Super Nintendo.
[160:21.58]Oh yeah.
[160:22.49]Ready for some high quality Zenegata gameplay.
[160:30.61]I'm not a young man.
[160:32.48]I'm not at all Soldier: 76 reporting for duty.
[160:37.66]Reporting for what duty?
[160:39.65]You're a loner.
[160:40.88]Soldier: 76 reporting for fucking duty, sir.
[160:49.12]What an odd name that is.
[160:50.85]Soldier: 76.
[160:51.91]What's the lore behind that?
[160:55.42]I can't wait to find out in the Overwatch cartoon.
[161:00.07]Playing Pharah again.
[161:05.04]I've played her for half the game so far.
[161:07.21]Leatherjacket, what's up dude?
[161:17.02]That's a lot of pain.
[161:19.35]They're all on the side building.
[161:20.88]Yes, they are.
[161:22.97]There's a Symmetra set up in there.
[161:25.84]Yeah, I didn't expect to get fucking a microwave.
[161:31.25]That's pretty much just a trap room.
[161:33.70]Junkrat hands.
[161:40.66]And a teleporter in there on the stairs.
[161:43.76]I got a teleporter.
[161:49.30]I don't even want to go in there.
[161:50.24]That's an easy bake oven room?
[161:52.57]I got two of the sentry's teleporters gone.
[161:55.24]Line aside.
[161:55.62]Line aside, MiSTAR.
[161:57.47]Would you just want me to list all of my accomplishments?
[162:01.04]I don't need your fucking...
[162:02.00]I don't need line of sight on you.
[162:02.79]I could have just healed.
[162:03.47]You wouldn't have to just go back to spawn.
[162:04.65]I would have just healed you.
[162:05.49]You gave me line of sight.
[162:06.90]Gosh.
[162:10.09]Elusha ulted.
[162:11.95]He did.
[162:12.57]He did indeed.
[162:13.96]I have an ult if we need it.
[162:15.33]I knocked Junkrat off the map.
[162:19.37]This guy should have a clear push.
[162:22.06]Is that actually moving with the cart?
[162:25.48]What the fuck's happening?
[162:28.55]I have an ult.
[162:29.13]Just stay on it.
[162:30.20]Do you guys find that like the left shift thing for Zenyatta is a little bit big?
[162:33.75]You guys ready?
[162:34.49]Ready to go in?
[162:35.12]Ready to go in?
[162:35.62]Need heals behind you, please.
[162:37.69]Well, you're gonna get a big heal in a second.
[162:40.85]Let's go!
[162:47.75]That ult's really good when people actually stand in it, but that doesn't happen.
[162:53.03]Go high noon someone.
[162:54.32]Up top, maybe?
[162:54.84]Behind you all.
[162:55.86]Behind?
[162:56.10]Yeah, he's up on the bridge.
[162:58.57]I was like, I'm still alive.
[163:11.01]Hold on a second, guys.
[163:12.68]I just got low health.
[163:15.94]Oh, blizzard.
[163:20.44]That's one of my favorite things in this game.
[163:28.00]Teleporter's down.
[163:31.35]Yikes.
[163:33.76]Stay back.
[163:34.99]I can't heal you all.
[163:37.65]Our team's dead.
[163:41.64]I'm not making an enjoyable experience for the Symmetra.
[163:51.07]Ooh, you just got all your health back in one second.
[163:54.29]Oh, a little harmony.
[163:55.62]And my heal.
[163:57.99]Stick your, uh, oh shit.
[164:00.12]Cut it.
[164:02.00]Stick your face out, Star.
[164:07.84]And Kevin.
[164:11.87]He's up top, going to the spaceship.
[164:14.32]McCree.
[164:17.33]Spaceship McCree.
[164:19.05]I'm going after him.
[164:21.21]He's got an orb on him.
[164:22.27]You should be able to kill him.
[164:24.50]Oh, shit.
[164:24.76]I don't see him.
[164:26.33]Hi, Newton.
[164:26.89]I still haven't seen him.
[164:28.69]Are you serious?
[164:30.96]oh he was all the way on the top oh what the hell he got he was up there for a long time too
[164:42.23]Do we have a teleporter again somewhere?
[164:44.46]Yeah.
[164:45.38]I'm fucked.
[164:46.69]No, you're okay.
[164:48.55]Oh, thank you so much.
[164:49.33]Thank you so much.

[165:21.84]What is this joke?
[165:24.97]Somebody has to know what that is.
[165:27.95]It's like one of my favorite videos of all time.
[165:30.48]I thought that was a commercial.
[165:31.73]It sounds like a commercial.
[165:34.02]Come on, somebody please know what that is.
[165:37.21]I know you say a lot, but I don't know where it's from.
[165:42.28]Like at this point it's like funny to me because you said it like maybe 30 to 50 times.
[165:47.54]Intellect shut up this channel.

[172:27.46]This player of the game could have been prevented by you.
[172:30.53]I gave you so much warning that he was up there.
[172:33.06]It was like a full 30 seconds.
[172:34.51]When you said he was up on the spaceship, I assumed you meant in the, like...
[172:38.75]not all the way on top like in the spaceship because you said it well he was in the spaceship and I said he was up there you're the one that flies around
[172:48.44]Get it together.
[172:49.12]I went back there, and I looked around for him, and I didn't see him.
[172:52.98]Whatever, it's fine.
[172:53.62]Don't worry.
[172:55.05]We did good.

[174:03.51]That's much more like it.
[174:04.43]The red X is funny.
[174:06.82]It has so many uses.
[174:08.15]I can't wait until they put in legendary sprays.
[174:13.74]What would they be?
[174:15.33]Would they put like an animated tunnel?
[174:17.06]You ready for a real Blizzard employee watching this right now?
[174:21.72]I want like 5% of the revenue because I came up with the idea.
[174:25.67]Legendary sprays should be huge.
[174:28.83]That's what they are.
[174:29.45]A legendary spray is just like five times bigger than a regular spray.
[174:34.63]And they're like textures.
[174:35.81]Like one's a wood texture and you can just re-texture a wall.
[174:38.02]No, it's like a banner.
[174:39.33]You could just put a huge Winston banner.
[174:41.30]That's like a legendary spray.
[174:43.02]I get 5% of the revenue.
[174:43.89]That would be so obnoxious.
[174:47.66]Huge Winston.
[174:49.62]Yeah
[174:50.44]Like giant.
[174:51.31]Like on the mountain side of Gibraltar.
[174:53.32]Like a giant Winston.
[174:54.40]How cool would that be?
[174:55.51]If they were like bigger.
[174:56.57]Just like much bigger versions.
[174:59.83]Okay, so take a look.
[175:00.47]Ready?
[175:00.61]This is what I'm talking about.
[175:01.33]So if I spray this right here, imagine if that was like a Tom Brady fathead.
[175:05.91]And it was like all, like took up like this whole wall here.
[175:10.44]I'd buy that for a dollar.
[175:13.82]Oh, you think it's gonna be a dollar?
[175:17.02]Jerma wants to take money from Blizzard for a spray, but he won't let me give him my money.
[175:23.80]It's different, though.
[175:24.70]This is a business venture.
[175:28.77]I think people are misunderstanding, and they're now expecting to all get Tom Brady fatheads for free.
[175:39.48]You've dug everyone into a deep hole here.
[175:42.53]Uh, instructions unclear.
[175:52.21]Alright, for a second, I thought this was Etalyx.
[175:55.14]I'm not even kidding.
[175:56.08]I was like, oh, there he is.
[175:59.75]Okay.
[176:02.23]What the fuck?
[176:06.40]What just happened?
[176:09.64]Where did he come from and where did he grab me in midair?
[176:12.58]Is that what happened?
[176:16.17]That was unbelievable if I'm not a crazy person.
[176:21.34]But I probably am a crazy person.
[176:30.09]RKO, I don't know.
[176:34.19]That was exactly what that was.
[176:41.26]Ouch!
[176:54.05]Please highlight that entire thing.
[176:59.55]Can't you do that with, like, odd shot or something?
[177:03.99]Somebody odd shot that.
[177:05.90]Whatever that is.
[177:06.54]Isn't that what it's called?
[177:11.21]I don't know.
[177:11.50]I just... What do those kids do these days?
[177:14.02]I was about to... Well, hello fellow kids.
[177:17.87]Kids do cocaine these days.
[177:21.58]What the hell are you talking about?
[177:24.07]Wrapping around the back.
[177:25.75]We've got two dudes.
[177:38.67]I haven't had a very good opportunity to do much here.
[177:40.55]I'm kind of just dying.
[177:46.53]Give me the odd shot.
[177:47.83]Odd shot, mate.
[177:50.13]Oh my god, damage bonus on a Genji with his sword out?
[177:55.48]That's a lot of damage.
[177:59.31]He just ran around and one-shot everybody.
[178:01.03]Are there people playing this game?
[178:02.16]Where is everybody?
[178:03.60]They just killed them all.
[178:09.75]Oh, look at Jerma, the fucking sweaty tryhard.
[178:12.07]Please pocket me.
[178:13.01]Please pocket me.
[178:14.08]I never said to do that.
[178:15.81]I don't know why you're doing it.
[178:16.77]Oh my God.
[178:17.34]Like he, no, like in private text messages, like my phone, he's been like every couple of seconds.
[178:21.79]Alright, here we go.
[178:22.41]You ready?
[178:22.96]You ready?
[178:23.50]Yeah.
[178:28.60]Where were you there?
[178:30.07]I was reviving the three dead teammates we had on the ground.
[178:33.56]You could have just damage boosted me and we would have killed like everybody there.
[178:39.99]And also stop the mattering once they actually push the cart to the checkpoint.
[178:45.89]Whatever you say.
[178:55.11]Damn, that hurt.
[179:01.02]He's just waiting for me to stick my head out.
[179:10.67]Tracer up here.
[179:24.32]Oh my god, there's a lot of people up there.
[179:32.26]You might get revived here in a second.
[179:34.62]No, I'm gonna die.
[179:36.79]Oh, I'm okay.
[179:41.62]Oh, my name is Boo
[179:49.32]He hasn't even said anything.
[179:52.49]I just saw him dodge a tracer ult there.
[179:56.36]That's what I thought probably went through his head when he did it.
[180:01.20]I just realized something.
[180:02.08]We've been playing with and against the same people for the last five games straight.
[180:09.97]It's kind of crazy.
[180:11.56]Don't you think?
[180:13.93]Thank you.
[180:14.37]Nice job, Boo.
[180:16.24]Thanks, Boo.
[180:17.18]You know what went through your head right there when you did that?
[180:19.89]I was thinking the whole time, my name's... You were thinking the whole time, my name's Boo.
[180:27.36]Your name's Bill.
[180:28.85]There he is.
[180:29.96]Oh shit.
[180:32.04]Got him.
[180:33.99]Who's in the car right now?
[180:35.00]Any people there?
[180:37.75]Tracer up top.
[180:41.03]About to go spaceship.
[180:42.76]I killed the Reinhardt.
[180:46.18]He just turned the corner and shot me right in the face.
[180:58.30]Dead, dead, dead.
[181:03.92]Dead dude over here.
[181:23.23]Oh my god.
[181:27.46]That wasn't directed.
[181:28.55]Oh my god, that's right.
[181:30.70]I didn't die.
[181:32.73]Oh they tried so hard.
[181:39.78]There's three people whaling on him, he was ulted, everything.
[181:42.86]I just kept the heal beam on him, man.
[181:45.39]Speaking of heal beams, thank you.
[181:50.88]Down.
[181:53.06]Thanks for the kill.
[181:53.84]Good job, Boo.
[181:54.54]That Tracer doesn't like you.
[181:56.75]Me?
[181:57.05]Or Boo?
[181:57.85]No, Boo.
[181:58.92]I don't know why.
[182:00.68]Like, what's with the Hanzo?
[182:08.16]Alright, I'm going to be real here.
[182:09.21]I thought I had that choice of dead like three different times.
[182:16.16]uh...
[182:20.43]What a pride, why did you say that?
[182:27.68]Because I have the imp skin.
[182:31.15]Shit.
[182:32.89]I just barely didn't make it back to the shield.
[182:42.84]97.
[182:43.77]98.
[182:44.07]99.
[182:51.77]One hundred.
[183:00.76]I was being sneaky there, but it didn't really matter.
[183:11.36]Ha ha!
[183:16.56]He's a little bit late with that.
[183:18.59]Yelled at himself.
[183:19.86]Zenyatta's a little bit late with that.
[183:24.74]Widowmaker, top right door.
[183:26.60]Top right?
[183:27.41]Top right door?
[183:28.78]Yeah.
[183:31.75]I'm gonna go.
[183:33.81]I can't.
[183:34.09]I'll get her right now.
[183:35.16]Ready?
[183:35.82]She's not even gonna know.
[183:37.23]She's gonna freak the fuck out when she sees me.
[183:40.74]See now she ran to spawn.
[183:51.79]Are you serious?
[184:02.04]Why did he ult back there?
[184:05.90]No, I guess he was ulted before.
[184:07.65]I thought he just hit that.
[184:08.41]Nah, he did it.
[184:10.78]I didn't even hear it.
[184:11.42]There was no audio cue.
[184:13.03]Usually you hear it, don't you?
[184:16.68]I did not hear that audio cue.
[184:21.44]Uh, you guys, Jigenji behind everybody.
[184:30.13]Smooth rocket.
[184:31.06]So crisp.
[184:31.66]So clean.
[184:33.55]Oh, what the fuck?
[184:38.57]Unbelievable.
[184:40.58]Where is she?
[184:49.05]Our time is running out everyone is on defense Nobody's up here, you know boo.
[184:55.37]I forgot that you used to play real video games
[184:59.80]Not fictitious ones.
[185:01.69]Real video games?
[185:02.61]Boo is a good video game player.
[185:03.63]What are you talking about?
[185:04.78]I know, I know, but like Hearthstone and WoW... Are those real video games?
[185:10.23]I know, man.
[185:12.82]I got old.
[185:15.40]Oh yeah, that's right.
[185:16.15]You don't even know.
[185:18.02]I know, I know that.
[185:19.85]I've reminded him multiple times.
[185:22.34]I haven't even told you about my rushed adventures yet.
[185:24.24]I fucking shot a guy in the face yesterday.
[185:26.09]It's real game already.
[185:28.18]Yeah.
[185:38.43]Grab that auto five.
[185:39.53]Yeah, that is a real video game too.
[185:44.21]Wow, Nidhogg the video game is...
[185:48.21]Alright, everybody leave, I have a box.
[185:54.12]Come on, Legendary.
[185:57.98]Oh!
[185:59.50]I got a legendary.
[186:02.92]It's gonna be gold.
[186:04.91]It better not be.
[186:07.57]Here we go.
[186:08.25]Oh, you left.
[186:09.39]Yeah, I have a box.
[186:10.01]I got a legendary.
[186:10.64]Come on, give me something good!
[186:13.15]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[186:16.16]That is one of the skins I wanted.
[186:18.19]Yeah, that's amazing.
[186:19.03]I have purple box, but I'm not going to open it until I stream three weeks from now.
[186:22.50]I have to guess what it is.
[186:24.53]I'm not going to look at your stream.
[186:25.86]It's going to be...
[186:28.39]I fucking have no idea.
[186:30.10]It's the raw Zenyatta.
[186:33.56]Oh, that's cool.
[186:34.60]That thing is fucking awesome.
[186:36.74]Hey!
[186:39.98]What else did we get?
[186:42.70]Okay, that's fine.
[186:44.59]I gotta play a game of Zenyatta now so nobody can see it.
[186:47.69]You know?
[186:48.02]It's like first person.
[186:52.46]That is so cool, though.
[186:54.14]Too bad they're wiping everything, right?
[186:57.88]Oh, well.
[187:00.85]Let's do it again.
[187:04.18]And I'm going to play Zenyatta.
[187:14.04]That's a badass skin.
[187:15.59]God bless.
[187:19.18]God bless.
[187:21.07]Oh, what a badass skin.
[187:22.42]God bless.
[187:24.62]Thank God you got that skin.
[187:26.41]That is so cool looking.
[187:27.43]Look at the balls, though.
[187:28.14]Even the balls are different, right?
[187:29.32]Yeah.
[187:32.13]Always look at the balls.
[187:34.54]First thing I go for.
[187:36.51]They're like soccer balls.
[187:38.32]No, they're like volleyballs.
[187:43.87]Wow.
[187:45.20]Yeah, that's right.
[187:48.20]Look at my skin.
[187:49.24]Look at how cool my skin is.
[187:50.99]Wow.
[187:51.81]Fuck you.
[187:53.07]Envy me.
[187:54.02]Envy me.
[187:55.23]Envy me.
[187:58.47]How about you envy me?
[188:13.00]I got to see my skin there.
[188:16.58]See, that's why you need an emote on every character, so you can actually look at your skin when you feel like it.
[188:25.20]I think the player icon should change too.
[188:28.11]The player icon should be raw.
[188:39.71]This isn't a real game.
[188:44.27]No, it's not a real game.
[188:45.31]It's a fake one.
[188:48.46]This is the... You want to see my legendary skins?
[188:53.87]Here's Tracer, even though I don't play this character.
[188:57.65]And I have Reinhardt.
[189:00.16]And now I have Zenyatta.
[189:02.81]I can't find two players.
[189:04.36]This is absolutely the coolest one of the three that I have.
[189:06.93]If only you had two extra players.
[189:09.54]If only.
[189:14.08]Oh.
[189:14.58]Well, they all got ported away.
[189:16.43]Thank God.
[189:18.42]Was that a full premade of six people?
[189:21.55]Oh, don't put us in there with him.
[189:24.42]Apparently.
[189:26.62]Uh-oh.
[189:27.65]Nope.
[189:28.01]We're just playing against the same guys we played last time.
[189:31.32]Or at least a couple of them.
[189:32.14]That's fine.
[189:33.46]good in game one of them I guess it is
[189:46.71]Yeah, we're gonna play some Roadhog.
[189:48.50]That's what I'm doing.
[189:54.54]He's my fave, you know.
[189:58.40]Our world is worth fighting for.
[190:00.16]Give me the Gaius.
[190:01.62]Give me the Gaius.
[190:08.09]Who are you playing as, Mei?
[190:11.11]Mei!
[190:11.56]I played some Mei yesterday, I had a ton of fun.
[190:16.44]I do want the shark skin for Roadhog.
[190:20.56]That is awesome.
[190:22.07]Pirate shark!
[190:28.51]That's like your go-to, huh?
[190:29.95]You're so salty.
[190:33.13]That's what I'm doing today.
[190:34.88]It's just a today thing.
[190:42.77]Get awesome skin, play Roadhog.
[190:48.06]What have they announced?
[190:48.77]Glue Man is the new hero?
[190:51.21]I'd expect 5% royalties.
[190:54.98]Why is it always 5%?
[191:00.01]This 5% seems fair enough that someone might actually say okay to it.
[191:03.79]5%.
[191:08.15]Like, if you go any higher than that, you're just going to get a no.
[191:11.34]Oh, you want, like, 10%?
[191:12.62]No.
[191:15.15]That is true.
[191:17.82]Thinking about picking a warrior.
[191:21.85]A warrior?
[191:23.54]Is that what you're talking about?
[191:26.67]What's the name there?
[191:27.97]I'm going to play a brawler.
[191:32.51]I would've just grabbed Pooh.
[191:34.55]During preparation and skirmish, you should be able to hook teammates.
[191:39.79]So you could really just, you know, give him a one-two, you know, and laugh at him.
[191:45.61]And then they'll be so salty, right?
[191:47.72]Yeah.
[191:48.19]Hey, Jerma, come here.
[191:50.38]Jerma, Jerma, come here.
[191:50.94]What do you want?
[191:51.35]I found about these cups.
[191:53.98]The stack of cups only shoot the bottom row.
[191:57.75]Did it.
[191:59.01]Where's my giant teddy bear?
[192:01.64]Where's my gigantic teddy bear from a 90s cartoon?
[192:05.94]Do you have any giant wrens from Ren and Stimpy that I can have?
[192:19.66]Lucky.
[192:20.55]Lucky that I missed you with that first little bit.
[192:30.29]Holy shit
[192:47.12]We're getting rolled, by the way.
[192:50.17]It's kind of early to say that, isn't it?
[192:55.24]Mm-hmm.
[192:55.78]Yeah, but...
[192:56.30]It's fairly early to say we're being rolled.
[192:57.71]Usually this early, you usually don't lose this much.
[193:01.51]Don't worry.
[193:06.95]I can't shoot her.
[193:07.61]Oh look, I can't shoot her.
[193:11.75]And she's still alive.
[193:13.41]I think we can't hurt him either.
[193:17.22]Ay yi yi.
[193:22.24]If I half-freeze Tracer and she rewinds, does she clear all that freeze that I did?
[193:26.07]Yes, she does.
[193:26.82]Oh, Jesus.
[193:28.23]She's impossible to freeze, just go for a headshot or a one-shot kill her.
[193:33.24]Really?
[193:34.10]I think it is 140, so she might have 10 health, but I think it is a one-shot.
[193:37.81]I have one shot.
[193:39.42]I don't know if she was missing the 10.
[193:41.51]I'll just just go for the head shots man It's not worth
[193:49.72]Oh, he wasted his ult right there.
[193:56.63]He just tried to ult, and he wasted it.
[194:00.09]Had my freeze.
[194:01.13]Blizzard shit.
[194:03.12]Oh, you're right.
[194:03.55]I shot her in the face and she fell over on her ass and died.
[194:05.94]Yep.
[194:10.26]No one can hide from my sight.
[194:18.97]Oh, I can't freeze her, which is... okay.
[194:22.51]Thank god for the Mei!
[194:23.49]Thank you, boo.
[194:26.31]Oh, piss.
[194:27.60]Whoa.
[194:28.94]Oh, beautiful.
[194:30.81]Yeah, I got him.
[194:35.00]Yeah!
[194:35.44]I'll show her the face again!
[194:37.79]Shit.
[194:38.50]Oh, you killed him.
[194:39.34]I missed him.
[194:42.21]Oh, nay.
[194:50.47]I'm so fat I can't fit through that.
[194:59.57]What the hell?
[195:00.99]I'm right through her.
[195:01.76]Above, uh...
[195:18.69]There's a Reaper up top.
[195:23.85]Thank you.
[195:30.97]Oh my god, Joker says, why so serious?
[195:33.71]But so does Junkrat.
[195:35.11]He looks like Joker.
[195:37.56]Wow!
[195:40.46]I needed help.
[195:45.45]Roadhog's healing seems unbalanced.
[195:47.20]Well, when you think of it like this, Roadhog only has HP.
[195:50.68]He doesn't have any armor or shields.
[195:53.47]So you die very easily.
[195:56.97]Give the other team a lot of ultimate.
[195:59.18]That's basically what Roadhog gets to do.
[196:02.73]Yeah, he has actually the least amount of potential damage he can take out of all the tanks, right?
[196:08.12]In one sitting.
[196:10.29]I don't know exactly how it worked out.
[196:14.82]Armor is weird.
[196:22.60]Who's in here?
[196:24.23]You get him.
[196:25.98]Thank you, Messy.
[196:35.59]Almost reflect killed me with something.
[196:38.02]Oh.
[196:38.36]Almost.
[196:41.59]Winston above.
[196:42.32]Here he comes.
[196:47.38]He's dead.
[196:48.09]You look a little stuck, Lúcio.
[196:51.16]Oh, there goes my bloody plan.
[196:55.01]Oh, Christ.
[196:55.37]Thank you.
[197:09.91]Well, there's two Genjis.
[197:14.13]He's dead.
[197:15.77]Thank you.
[197:17.90]And who am I going to ult?
[197:23.55]These guys.
[197:26.12]No!
[197:27.02]Whoa!
[197:29.13]See ya.
[197:30.20]Through the boxes.
[197:38.01]Oh, what was it?
[197:40.78]Dude, you're the blood-stained reaper.
[197:43.61]The perfect icefall.
[197:46.75]Oh, jeez.
[197:47.76]Oh, synergy.
[197:51.29]Never turn around.
[197:53.77]I'm sorry.
[197:54.39]I'm not used to getting shot or hurt by anything.
[197:57.52]I don't turn.
[198:01.30]Oh, I see how this goes.
[198:02.43]I join a party, I never get on the board.
[198:04.81]Great.
[198:10.41]Excellent.
[198:11.83]Excellent.
[198:17.05]Alright, I want to get to 40 and then I'm probably going to stop streaming.
[198:20.94]So that's going to be like at least another like three to five games.
[198:23.94]And we have to win them all and I have to get gold medals.
[198:26.01]Three to five hours.
[198:27.32]No.
[198:37.11]Etalyx?
[198:39.37]The Etalyx?
[198:40.52]Yes, hello.
[198:41.36]So, what's the... What's going on here?
[198:44.89]What is the forecast?
[198:48.59]If they even do one today, it probably won't be for at least another hour.
[198:54.27]So, I'm going to be waiting for one.
[198:57.17]view you pick nickelodeon presents you pick the first character I see in chat is I'm gonna play nickelodeon presents stick stickly you pick
[199:06.72]No, no, but that was before I said it that was before I said it Oh
[199:16.10]Okay now it's Bastion, okay.
[199:17.57]Now it's Bastion.
[199:19.70]Attacking Bastion.
[199:21.46]Was it the same guy?
[199:25.16]On attack, this is going to be hard.
[199:27.75]Actually, no.
[199:28.05]I'll just sit on the cart.
[199:32.12]In that case, I guess I'll Reinhardt.
[199:35.14]No!
[199:36.87]This happened earlier.
[199:37.67]The last time I didn't have a player view model,
[199:43.26]could not defend objective A off my screen.
[199:46.22]Hopefully that doesn't happen again.
[199:55.34]I'm gonna play with you, baby.
[199:56.73]I have the iron giant spray.
[200:03.29]Attack commences in 30 seconds.
[200:06.42]You would be dead so much right here, man.
[200:10.02]God, I would have at least one or two kills on you.
[200:15.62]You get 100% hook accuracy.
[200:17.55]That's actually extremely difficult because you overthink everything and you will miss.
[200:24.80]Grow one hook and then stop playing the hero.
[200:27.23]I would say with at least 10 enemies hooked.
[200:29.46]That would be impressive if you could do it.
[200:31.37]If you could do it.
[200:38.86]Just go get on the cart, Dermot.
[200:40.21]I'll shield you.
[200:40.82]They shoot you.
[200:42.17]Up on the top top.
[200:45.04]I'm too fat to get up there.
[200:47.29]That's what I'm doing.
[200:48.39]It might be because it was on a hill.
[200:49.72]Maybe you are too fat.
[200:50.92]What the fuck?
[200:51.79]There's a Metro shooting through my shield.
[201:00.37]Maybe I am too fat to get up there.
[201:02.25]I've seen people get up there before.
[201:07.07]Maybe you've never played an FPS game before and you don't know how to crouch jump.
[201:11.47]That is absolutely not what happened.
[201:12.90]I was trying to do it.
[201:13.60]It just wouldn't work.
[201:15.09]Maybe to go on the front?
[201:19.22]I think you have to jump off of a hill or something onto it.
[201:30.95]Show yourself.
[201:35.55]You know I just saved your life, right?
[201:36.76]Did you?
[201:38.40]Yeah, he hooked you.
[201:40.77]Did he?
[201:41.98]Yeah.
[201:42.86]You sure?
[201:43.66]Did he?
[201:44.74]You sure about that?
[201:45.67]Did he?
[201:46.37]Oh, they rushed.
[201:47.05]They put the shield on you.
[201:48.65]They couldn't.
[201:49.84]Did he?
[201:56.72]Oh boy.
[201:59.66]Now I got hooked.
[202:02.51]There's a Genji behind us.
[202:04.55]Oh, Boo's back in action.
[202:06.75]Oh, boy!
[202:09.08]Boo's back in action?
[202:13.07]Alright, Buu, give us your best British accent.
[202:15.14]No.
[202:20.54]No, I'm not even gonna talk for the rest of this.
[202:25.98]And somebody come out of there
[202:35.53]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[202:38.91]Lower him out, bait him out.
[202:41.02]That's what it says, I just can't do it.
[202:44.07]I'm going to listen to you guys do it for the rest of the stream.
[202:50.33]Oh, piss.
[202:52.84]Oh, shit, Merzy.
[202:54.06]I'm gonna be frozen!
[203:05.44]right when I press Q.
[203:13.67]Oh, Mei's behind.
[203:14.73]Nah, with a Mercy.
[203:17.59]I hate this character.
[203:19.17]Who?
[203:21.10]sorry I'm playing her and it's just like why terrible am I allowed to do these things
[203:30.85]Where?
[203:32.12]Where?
[203:33.77]It's you.
[203:41.73]The blue is bad.
[203:42.68]I just got killed by a Mercy.
[203:44.55]Not so much I wasn't paying attention.
[203:57.60]This bollocks is big.
[204:01.53]Bastion does such an outrageous amount of damage.
[204:06.17]It's just kind of stupid.
[204:08.29]I just killed three people there, and I shot them for maybe a total of one and a half seconds.
[204:14.05]Maybe a quarter of a second for each person.
[204:16.70]Great.
[204:17.42]There we go, I got him.
[204:21.02]Is Roadhog still here?
[204:22.65]You have to go up like on the edge, not like the back.
[204:25.80]Really?
[204:26.02]That didn't kill him?
[204:31.46]Is there a Mercy still in that building?
[204:37.18]I'm just barely out of its range.
[204:39.83]No, I had the shield on you the whole time.
[204:41.78]Oh, that's why I didn't...
[204:42.79]Sorry, a bubble stopped everything.
[204:43.96]Three behind us!
[204:44.78]Jesus!
[204:45.38]It really is like three people behind us.
[204:48.27]I'm just still on the cart.
[204:49.86]I like refuse to get off the cart.
[204:54.06]Look at this.
[204:54.82]Look at this cart heavy.
[204:57.37]This is so dumb.
[205:10.26]No!
[205:12.14]Again, it happened again.
[205:20.69]They have to focus the Bastion.
[205:22.54]You have to do something about it, and the moment anyone goes for it, he can't be hurt by anything.
[205:28.81]Oh my god, I almost have a gold medal in everything except death.
[205:36.29]Really?
[205:36.57]I haven't done anything.
[205:37.68]What did I do?
[205:41.56]You don't think you have the most damage?
[205:45.33]I mean, I'm sure I do, but that's like... Go set up.
[205:48.88]I'll cover you.
[205:49.91]I am set up.
[205:51.06]No, like walk out here.
[206:04.43]Haha!
[206:06.44]Where?
[206:08.13]Where are you Reaper?
[206:11.69]Hey!
[206:13.49]How dare you try to kill me?
[206:15.94]There he is!
[206:22.43]Thank you for the revive.
[206:24.93]Appreciate it.
[206:27.34]I gotta get back on the cart.
[206:28.63]That's my place where I'm the most safe.
[206:31.68]Yeah, you slide off.
[206:32.53]You gotta go, like, up top.
[206:34.09]Yeah, you have to go on the front tire.
[206:36.34]Watch this.
[206:38.13]I don't even care.
[206:40.38]I got her.
[206:40.72]Thank God.
[206:49.48]That was worth it.
[206:51.97]You need to get on the cart and you need to plow them all.
[206:56.43]Well, I died, so...
[206:59.46]I know, I'm working.
[207:05.54]I have an ult.
[207:08.11]Alright, well, I have an ult.
[207:09.73]We'll play one more.
[207:10.41]Watch out.
[207:10.72]Watch out.
[207:11.36]Watch out.
[207:11.64]Watch out.
[207:13.89]Okay.
[207:15.92]You let me know when you want to do some plowing.
[207:18.40]I'm going to...
[207:19.72]Alright, I'm ready to do an ult around this corner.
[207:22.14]Hold on, let me try and get some guys.
[207:24.07]There's a Mei behind you.
[207:25.87]And there are people everywhere.
[207:27.99]Up top, up top, up top, up top, up top.
[207:33.09]Yeah, it was a bad time to do that.
[207:35.36]I acknowledge.
[207:37.81]Oh wow, you did just kind of do it.
[207:40.28]Alright, well.
[207:42.84]You're messing up my all gold bastion.
[207:46.66]It wasn't all gold because I had gold eliminations, I told you that.
[207:49.32]And now I have gold objective time, so why don't you go fuck yourself.
[207:51.97]Well, maybe if we didn't do what you wanted, like, oh, I'm gonna press Q. Oh, fucking, like, self-righteous.
[207:56.56]Oh, yeah, well, it's press Q. Oh.
[208:24.95]Rumor has it... Oh no, she put the thing in front of me!
[208:29.26]I thought she was next to you dude.
[208:30.99]She's like... Oh my god!
[208:36.73]Run!
[208:41.06]It's still living and how is this base still alive she keeps putting them getting like Oh my god, there's another one
[208:51.05]I almost had you.
[208:56.18]No!
[208:56.71]No!
[209:00.01]User left your channel.
[209:03.93]The whole game is revolving around you.
[209:19.49]They only had one Mei?
[209:21.03]I thought they had two.
[209:28.36]Do we win?
[209:30.15]No, I have to get over there.
[209:31.01]No, I lost my gold eliminations.
[209:33.24]I cannot lose my gold eliminations.
[209:35.15]I have to.
[209:37.86]Come on.
[209:39.50]Nope.
[209:40.39]Uh, how many do you have?
[209:41.07]21.
[209:42.00]I got 23.
[209:43.35]Oh, you...
[209:47.11]Bullshit.
[209:47.96]I would have had like four or five gold medals.
[209:55.18]Who are you playing as, Boo?
[210:00.74]If I had been able to stay on that car for longer, I would have had five gold medals.
[210:13.35]I upvote Roadhogs.
[210:21.47]Me, Boo, and... Me, Boo, Jerma.
[210:26.59]Me, Boo, Jerma.
[210:27.35]What about it?
[210:28.93]All the cards.
[210:30.39]We had card real estate.
[210:32.18]We did.
[210:36.18]We did have some real estate there.
[210:46.68]So what do you think they can do to Zarya to make her not crazy?
[210:52.91]Do you think it's just the shield?
[210:55.14]Put her in a wheelchair.
[211:00.43]I did not expect that for an answer.
[211:12.82]Alright, I'm gonna embarrass myself on Hanzo.
[211:14.47]It'll be fun.
[211:18.16]Was it like... How many people are watching?
[211:20.19]Like 40,000?
[211:23.25]Yeah, these like 48,000 people will see me play on Hanzo and lose.
[211:35.26]With every death... ...comes honor.
[211:38.38]With honor... ...redemption.
[211:42.14]I grow tired... ...of waiting.
[211:47.43]40k.
[211:52.59]You know what my biggest problem with Hanzo really is?
[211:59.55]is the drop off of the arrows.
[212:03.00]The drop off of the arrows.
[212:04.96]I'm so used to playing like obviously Huntsman in TF2.
[212:09.70]The drop-off is like just very slightly exaggeratedly different.
[212:15.81]That's a total contradiction of what I actually just said.
[212:19.27]Let me rephrase that.
[212:20.74]The slight change in how this arrow functions and drops off...
[212:24.45]is exaggerated for how much I overcompensate for because I'm used to playing TF2.
[212:28.59]It's also quite a bit faster.
[212:29.82]Yeah, it's...
[212:31.77]I have hundreds of hours.
[212:32.92]I try to predict people's movement, and it always, like...
[212:37.06]I like over predict by a mile.
[212:40.83]I honestly probably have like at least a hundred hours on sniper on Huntsman.
[212:46.66]in that game.
[212:47.52]I used to play that religiously.
[212:51.47]You hear that, guys?
[212:53.07]Now you know what Jerma religion is.
[213:02.47]I gotta stay back.
[213:03.35]I don't know what I was doing.
[213:17.24]Mmm.
[213:26.40]Uh-oh, I gotta get that teleporter.
[213:27.79]Teleporter, smell-o-porter.
[213:28.73]You know what they say.
[213:31.54]See, like, the drop-off there, I'm, like, just trying.
[213:33.24]It's so different, but so similar.
[213:43.72]So basically what you're saying is you're the reason we're losing and they still have the teleporter, smell-o-porter.
[213:48.61]I don't know.
[214:00.74]Fucking hell, mate.
[214:02.65]It's actually probably one of the reasons I'll never really be able to play this character.
[214:06.48]I, like, long-term play him all the time.
[214:13.30]Where is it?
[214:20.94]Where is it?
[214:21.38]It's right next to me.
[214:25.13]We're all animals.
[214:33.88]Oh, and I timed it.
[214:34.93]I was ready for him, and I still didn't hit it.
[214:38.45]That sucks.
[214:40.18]Is knowing English a requirement for joining Overwatch?
[214:45.10]Because I mean they have a lot of multicultural
[214:47.06]heroes and their squad, but they all know English.
[214:56.14]Why is there a Roadhog behind us?
[215:01.92]Why is EVERYONE on their team behind us?
[215:06.81]Is it anything like the Huntsman?
[215:08.68]No, they're like completely different.
[215:13.00]They got people on the cart?
[215:14.20]Alright, I'm just gonna do it.
[215:15.77]You heard it first here.
[215:17.33]They're completely different, but I'm still going to compare them.
[215:20.26]And everyone will always compare them.
[215:21.71]Well, name me another video game that, while I change off of the character...
[215:27.01]Well, name me another character where that is actually in the game.
[215:29.77]Do you want to switch?
[215:30.31]Do you want to play Roadhog?
[215:31.40]I want to play Hanzo.
[215:32.62]Yeah, let's switch.
[215:37.23]What the fuck?
[215:40.57]You know, you could have, like, spent one more life ulting.
[215:44.31]And done, like, 20 damage to somebody.
[215:46.19]But you would have... What?
[215:49.54]I'm not interested.
[215:52.45]Okay.
[215:55.91]I grabbed her.
[215:56.73]I feel like that's been happening a lot recently.
[216:01.14]It did the gotcha.
[216:02.75]But she didn't come.
[216:07.57]There, I pretty much made up for what I would have done with the ult.
[216:16.69]Kind of getting knocked around here.
[216:19.42]Father of Pearl!
[216:21.18]They speak different languages, but they still all know English.
[216:25.80]That's what I'm saying.
[216:28.94]What are you?
[216:29.30]What are you talking about?
[216:32.60]Nothing.
[216:37.75]I can live with those.
[216:43.29]Junkrat.
[216:43.47]Come on, show your face.
[216:44.86]Show your face.
[216:46.00]Show it!
[216:49.15]He shot it.
[216:57.34]Oh, chuck.
[217:01.74]He just hit me like nine times.
[217:12.76]What?
[217:16.50]Are you doing Widowmaker?
[217:21.47]No, you say that like when you lose a Genji-Hanko fight.
[217:24.49]That's what you have to say.
[217:25.73]You win this time, brother.
[217:29.40]Is that what you said?
[217:31.35]Yeah.
[217:36.27]Oh, Jesus.
[217:37.64]Let him stay in that room for all we care.
[217:43.27]He's still chasing me!
[217:46.09]Oh, I wish I had my ult right now.
[217:49.34]I don't.
[217:53.41]There wasn't like another two people here?
[218:04.59]Dasher.
[218:06.08]Are you in this time of instant war?
[218:14.93]We have a Genji behind.
[218:17.20]And he's dashing.
[218:18.34]Everywhere.
[218:29.59]Oh, you win this time, fella.
[218:34.52]That has replaced the last with the character you fight.
[218:41.24]This guy just sucks.
[218:51.68]Watch out for Winston on the right.
[219:00.27]He's just got me in the corner!
[219:01.85]Help!
[219:04.91]He had me locked in there.
[219:07.50]I wouldn't have pulled him if I knew he had his ult.
[219:08.87]I thought I could just...
[219:09.75]He wins this time.
[219:12.85]Can you stop it?
[219:14.30]No.
[219:16.37]Make me.
[219:16.87]Come over here and make me.
[219:18.97]See you in 20 minutes.
[219:21.02]Coming.
[219:32.52]Why did you have to land like there?
[219:33.64]Why did you have to do that?
[219:43.63]These guys are on teleporters.
[219:51.33]Teleporter!
[219:54.59]Watch out.
[219:55.98]Watch out.
[219:59.37]He's going in the building.
[220:01.82]He's coming for you.
[220:11.44]Come on, get on it, get on it, get on it.
[220:15.28]You stuff like doing clothes?
[220:18.98]This Winston, I feel like as a player, what's happening right here?
[220:21.35]I think, oh.
[220:22.77]I was like hiding behind him.
[220:28.30]Shit.
[220:31.06]I blame that Winston just being like standing upright like a mannequin.
[220:35.65]You guys all saw that.
[220:43.45]That Winston was actually still playing and he was dead.
[220:47.36]Destiny is the only duty I know.
[220:58.30]I love this person's name.
[221:00.27]Cheesy Cheeseburger.
[221:02.81]That's a great name.
[221:07.00]Where's this Genji?
[221:07.67]There he is.
[221:08.65]No, he's not in the red anymore.
[221:16.47]Oh my god.
[221:18.56]He just, holy shit.
[221:20.93]He just ran all the way around again.
[221:23.85]I'm waiting for him.
[221:24.63]We'll get him.
[221:26.29]He's gonna wish he was never born.
[221:32.17]Wish he were never born.
[221:42.70]He's so dead over here.
[221:58.12]Give me the health.
[222:00.87]Give me the health.
[222:07.06]Two healths.
[222:09.95]I'm looking at an all gold everything right now.
[222:12.22]Step your game up.
[222:13.73]He's dead.
[222:14.33]He's dead.
[222:18.50]I wasn't playing Roadhog until we switched.
[222:23.31]Definitely Genji.
[222:26.12]We switched like halfway through.
[222:29.08]Yeah, and this is the half we're losing in.
[222:31.78]Julia Yeah, you weren't doing shit.
[222:35.56]I've heard I remember somebody spit specifically alting in the spawn.
[222:40.13]Oh
[222:43.93]I remember specifically having all gold medals.
[222:46.96]How much damage do you have?
[222:48.42]Nobody gives a shit.
[222:49.19]Hey, nobody gives a shit.
[222:50.57]What are you looking at here?
[222:51.66]How much damage are you looking at here?
[222:53.14]Do you think anyone gives a shit about anything you're saying right now?
[222:56.68]Boo, where's your play of the game?
[222:57.90]Boo was doing more than you.
[223:00.67]Oh, this is between me and you.
[223:04.99]Yeah, let's see what Boo did.
[223:07.17]A lot, it seems.
[223:12.44]Yeah, I was there too.
[223:13.48]I killed all those people.
[223:14.39]Five gold medals.
[223:15.66]Who doesn't have a card?
[223:16.44]Where's Boo's card?
[223:24.00]Every time you join a call, it just makes it fucking extremely annoying to play this game, by the way.
[223:29.28]Seriously.
[223:29.99]God, get out of here.
[223:35.66]You want to just write me negative and get it over with?
[223:38.54]Yeah, you were stealing all my kills there.
[223:44.87]I just...
[223:46.78]I want a crate.
[223:48.54]You'll get one.
[223:52.23]Okay, I need like 3,200 points.
[223:54.04]Can I do that in one game?
[223:54.88]It needs to be a bitching game.
[223:57.25]Can you throw?
[223:58.24]Yeah.
[224:01.86]Wait, someone was talking shit about Moonboy?
[224:04.33]Are you kidding me?
[224:14.89]I'll play Lúcio.
[224:18.33]Oh, pump up the volume.
[224:22.24]An MVP right here.
[224:24.22]Play to win.
[224:29.06]What are we waiting for?
[224:34.08]players.
[224:44.24]Yeah.
[224:58.68]I'm hungry and I just ate.
[225:03.66]Nope.
[225:04.02]New hero confirmed.
[225:06.14]New hero Zordon from Power Rangers coming soon.
[225:31.23]Reassemble.
[225:37.96]I think they built in
[225:43.21]What is it?
[225:44.90]On Twitch, they built in the replay chat.
[225:47.55]When you watch a VOD back, it'll show chat as if you're watching live now.
[225:52.93]Is it really?
[225:53.46]That's in beta right now.
[225:55.22]Yeah, that's been a popular plug in there, but apparently Twitch is saying they hired the guy who made it to make it part of Twitch.
[226:02.06]That's cool.
[226:04.33]Cool stuff, cool stuff.
[226:05.61]You know what that means.
[226:07.36]You can, if you ever do anything in your lives again besides watch my VODs,
[226:13.49]I'll know.
[226:15.17]I wish there was a trail this left where you were.
[226:17.50]It was like yellow, like a butter trail or something.
[226:21.09]That'd be so cool.
[226:22.09]Just like... And it's just dripping and shit.
[226:26.90]Ah, it'd be amazing.
[226:28.43]A butter yam here?
[226:39.07]Finkel is Einhorn.
[226:41.14]That's a good one.
[226:42.10]I like that.
[226:44.43]You can't crouch in the mech.
[226:46.20]This is huge.
[226:50.26]Watch out for those people up there.
[226:54.26]Alright, Boo.
[226:55.08]Ready to go.
[226:55.57]Real fast!
[226:56.47]Yeah.
[227:00.74]Jesus.
[227:03.84]Get over there.
[227:05.97]What are you thinking?
[227:06.78]I'm like trying to do he was like stuck on the wall
[227:12.91]Whoa.
[227:14.74]Whoa.
[227:15.85]He was stuck on the wall.
[227:26.51]Hey, Boo, there's a Genji on the stairs behind you.
[227:28.83]He's discorded.
[227:31.34]I don't care.
[227:32.43]Boo, you got a damage boosted.
[227:34.25]Somebody coming over there near you.
[227:36.38]I'm kind of going to focus on Soldier.
[227:39.85]Are you playing as support right now?
[227:44.09]Me?
[227:45.08]Yeah, I use Zenyatta.
[227:46.53]I love playing Zenyatta.
[227:48.56]Well, I wouldn't have played Lúcio.
[227:51.03]You wouldn't play the best character in the game because I'm on Zenyatta.
[227:55.26]Well, I would play a damage dealer or something.
[227:57.92]Zenyatta is a damage dealer, which I'm playing because...
[228:00.83]Your picks because I'm you know, you don't fuck off back back back back back back back
[228:10.82]We have three, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[228:16.59]I'm sorry.
[228:17.05]Who's our third?
[228:17.66]No, no.
[228:18.90]No, it's too late.
[228:21.70]I have an ult.
[228:31.51]New clock
[228:37.26]I don't even like Symmetra as a real support.
[228:39.52]She's like, she's got a bougie booty.
[228:41.93]What the hell are you talking about?
[228:49.18]Alright, well, it's just me and you.
[228:53.81]Just you and I here.
[228:55.12]You ready to do some damage?
[228:57.18]Yeah.
[228:58.06]You're dead.
[228:58.89]Yeah, I'm dead.
[228:59.68]Oh, just-
[229:12.06]Like actual characters they could kill people yeah, we don't have any I'm going like Farah or something we need some damage
[229:20.13]Oh, Jerma plays Pharah again.
[229:23.06]It's like the second or third time I've played the character.
[229:25.26]We have three supports.
[229:27.15]Nobody... Half of our team is not hurting anybody.
[229:31.06]I am.
[229:32.93]You say that, but... Fuck.
[229:35.22]Is Soldier: 76 behind everybody?
[229:42.01]I mean, you say that, but...
[229:49.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[229:50.52]Impressive life on fire you had there.
[229:52.47]What am I supposed to do when they're fucking rolling right now?
[230:00.54]Yeah, go right back to like your fat ass self.
[230:05.36]Do I have the orb or what?
[230:08.98]You can heal yourself.
[230:11.98]Fine.
[230:19.32]I can understand why you might feel entitled.
[230:21.09]You know, all the fucking streamers get the Overwatch beta.
[230:24.49]They, like, expect orbs on them as well.
[230:28.22]They're so annoying.
[230:34.27]I have an ult by the way, so like you're gonna need to like be up here.
[230:39.71]Be up here?
[230:40.57]I'm up here.
[230:54.42]Oh my god, we were just in the way.
[230:56.83]I grabbed him, somehow.
[231:00.27]Your big butt was in the way.
[231:03.32]Sorry.
[231:06.08]No, he killed a few at least.
[231:08.46]Yeah, okay.
[231:14.59]Jesus Christ, he didn't beat my pistol as D.Va.
[231:17.44]Oh, I just might back again so fast.
[231:21.42]Got it.
[231:22.40]Wow.
[231:23.82]Kenji's going around the left side.
[231:25.20]Oh, here's your orb.
[231:45.91]Walk it out, mate.
[231:50.61]Yeah, this is my fifth stream in 30 days, you're right.
[231:59.73]That's a long run.
[232:20.47]Okay.
[232:24.38]Nice ult.
[232:24.85]Nice ult.
[232:25.21]Nice ult.
[232:25.59]Yeah, let's keep going.
[232:26.23]Let's keep going.
[232:26.97]Yeah, nice ult.
[232:27.46]Keep going.
[232:27.82]Keep going.
[232:28.16]Let's keep going.
[232:28.80]Come on.
[232:29.04]Let's go.
[232:29.35]Let's go.
[232:29.65]Let's go.
[232:30.61]I actually pressed Q by accident.
[232:33.04]After I grabbed him, it was like, whoops, WQ.
[232:38.18]WQ.
[232:38.98]WQ.
[232:39.37]I hit him both at the same time.
[232:55.79]It happens.
[233:00.04]Ah, Roadhog's back!
[233:01.05]Oh, what the fuck?
[233:01.85]Really?
[233:02.59]Really?
[233:03.86]Really?
[233:04.32]That was a bad move.
[233:05.89]I think Star Wars Warp needs splash damage.
[233:09.34]I didn't even hit anybody.
[233:11.18]Didn't do anything right there.
[233:17.29]I think Zenyatta should be able to like, fly.
[233:19.12]He can obviously cover.
[233:20.09]He should be able to fly to him.
[233:21.51]His orb should do splash damage.
[233:29.02]Get out of town.
[233:32.59]We got this mean you we got all fucking should have talked what are you doing gigantic dumbass?
[233:37.69]Why wouldn't you say you're gonna hold?
[233:42.58]Why didn't you say, hey, I'm going to ult?
[233:47.75]What was that all about?
[233:48.61]You just came up behind me and said, hi.
[233:52.05]What the hell was that?
[233:53.30]Did you just alt me?
[234:01.74]looking good to play
[234:19.51]Are you like writing in my chat and not playing?
[234:26.87]This is an intense game!
[234:30.66]Alright, Jerry.
[234:38.42]Holy crap, I'm so easy to hit this D.Va.
[235:00.01]Oh, tranquility.
[235:02.74]Oh, we are surrounded, man.
[235:04.12]Yes, we are.
[235:08.06]And he got revived.
[235:16.90]Ooh.
[235:21.61]Roadhog.
[235:24.76]I must have another ult.
[235:25.60]Didn't I just do it?
[235:45.77]I like the way Blizzard designed this game so when you get an elimination for 10 points, you can say, yeah, I got two kills.
[235:52.75]Just look at the lower left, everybody.
[235:53.86]That's all I need to say.
[235:57.89]I can back it up right now.
[236:15.88]Yeah back it up like I keep seeing you back up like a coward running away from the cart
[236:26.35]Hey, somebody to subscribe.
[236:28.42]Dr. Rival.
[236:32.97]Welcome.
[236:39.03]It's.
[236:53.12]If that's not play of the game, I'm unsubscribing from, um, Netflix.
[237:04.02]Oh, the tiny Tim also subscribed too.
[237:05.73]Thanks, dude.
[237:07.41]Welcome.
[237:17.20]What's going on, dudes?
[237:20.95]Not playing the game.
[237:22.26]Say bye to your Netflix accounts.
[237:26.64]Yeah.
[237:28.66]I don't know, I've been watching Z Nation again.
[237:33.73]Guess I don't care how that ends now.
[237:36.52]Because that guy got one fucking kill.
[237:38.49]That was awesome.
[237:40.98]Bye, Netflix.
[237:49.14]I mean, come on now.
[237:54.07]Star better not get more than a mic, thank God.
[237:56.84]I'm just gonna say.
[238:00.11]Did I get my crate?
[238:00.73]Did I get my crate?
[238:03.79]Oh yeah.
[238:05.45]Oh yeah.
[238:06.76]Leave game so he can open his box.
[238:09.19]Yeah, that's a really bad feature.
[238:12.21]Everyone has to leave.
[238:13.70]I don't know if it has been pointed out enough, but...
[238:16.31]That's really not good.
[238:18.34]I know the option is there, like when you press escape and it tells you to go to the main menu.
[238:24.23]That's not a good system.
[238:26.20]Or go to Bastion Skin.
[238:27.79]Is it epic or legendary?
[238:29.68]What is it?
[238:30.49]Epic.
[238:30.97]And it looks exactly the same as normal.
[238:34.08]What is the point of that?
[238:35.83]Defense Matrix.
[238:37.48]Yeah, that's my epic reward.
[238:40.84]What an epic reward.
[238:43.60]I'm gonna go get a drink.
[238:45.35]Don't talk shit about me while I'm gone.
[238:47.47]I don't have to.
[238:49.18]You already do that.
[238:49.82]You already make yourself look silly.
[238:58.92]Oh, skirmish.
[238:59.56]That means I can play whoever I want.
[239:02.12]Yeah.
[239:02.26]Maybe I'll do a little bit of Mei.
[239:03.84]And round out the stream, because...
[239:06.35]I didn't even look.
[239:07.06]How close was I to...
[239:09.43]To 40.
[239:09.92]Tell me, you're gonna do a Widowmaker round, yeah?
[239:14.31]No.
[239:15.06]Absolutely not.
[239:16.54]Talking about my butt?
[239:18.04]Every time I do a Widowmaker round, I go on tilt and do terrible the whole game.
[239:30.16]Alright.
[239:35.06]Oh!
[239:35.26]What?
[239:35.38]Are you...
[239:37.05]I don't know why.
[239:37.93]What is going on?
[239:40.70]What happened?
[239:43.16]Okay, I thought I punched him in the face so hard that he died.
[239:45.97]Oh, I shot him in the head.
[239:48.26]Yeah, I thought I did like 200 damage with that punch in the face.
[239:52.78]I feel a little bit bad about that.
[240:00.16]No!
[240:02.31]Ah.
[240:02.47]Oh, defense, defense, defense, defense, defense.
[240:04.32]Fucking hate this map.
[240:06.18]I actually haven't played on this, I don't think, one time in four hours.
[240:09.70]Yeah.
[240:11.06]I haven't played in a few days.
[240:11.99]Alright, so how do we win this?
[240:17.11]I don't know.
[240:17.45]I don't even care.
[240:20.71]I tell you, you're not going to win with Mei.
[240:23.55]I just want to play Mei.
[240:27.18]You know what?
[240:27.62]You're probably right.
[240:29.71]Nah, she's okay for the last push.
[240:31.30]If you Ice Wall off their spawns and you can get the ult, your ult's really good on last point.
[240:35.16]Well, whatever.
[240:36.46]Do whatever you want, man.
[240:37.34]Just have fun.
[240:37.88]Just have fun with it.
[240:38.42]You know, it's a beta game.
[240:39.55]Don't... No!
[240:43.68]We have to win.
[240:44.83]Yeah, he's right.
[240:46.53]Alright, okay.
[240:47.46]Practice your aim in here, guys.
[240:48.42]Practice your aim.
[240:50.85]I will not settle for fun.
[240:53.87]New character confirmed.
[240:54.71]Up here.
[240:55.58]See it?
[240:59.51]Yeah, why are her lips so big?
[241:03.90]And why is there a snowman on it?
[241:08.66]Hey, new character confirmed.
[241:09.69]Why is there a big lipstick and why is there a snowman?
[241:28.15]I just like right-clicking as Mei.
[241:36.50]They buffed it.
[241:38.07]They buffed it.
[241:38.57]Yeah, and that's why I'm playing her more often.
[241:40.49]That's the only reason why I play her.
[241:42.78]I don't do anything else at Mei besides I like to right click on people.
[241:47.18]I hope you hit somebody soon, because my shield's already down.
[241:56.64]Yeah, me too.
[242:03.20]Don't worry, I got this.
[242:03.85]I'll heal myself.
[242:07.26]Go the other way.
[242:08.45]Oh, you're on the silver wall.
[242:10.04]You... You locked me in there?
[242:12.29]I...
[242:19.95]Pretty doomed anyway.
[242:22.28]I'm getting kills here.
[242:28.27]Wowowow.
[242:29.06]Ugh.
[242:30.30]Where is it?
[242:30.74]The new character is jermaMoon.
[242:39.33]M7 out.
[242:46.99]Get out of the fight!
[242:51.75]well it's okay because I got like three or four people there's a reaper in the potty
[243:03.76]Reaper in the potty?
[243:06.87]We're all dead.
[243:08.70]We're all dead.
[243:09.30]Hold on a second, how?
[243:13.21]It's actually just you dead.
[243:14.46]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[243:18.19]Every single person is here but you.
[243:21.18]We're all dead.
[243:22.82]That was a shot.
[243:24.19]You guys just came back from spawn.
[243:25.53]I was there alone for a really long time.
[243:27.18]Then I got Zarya all...
[243:28.18]And I thought everyone was dying.
[243:32.37]Well now we have an easy push.
[243:35.13]Quick, quick, quick, hurry!
[243:36.12]I even have my res.
[243:36.89]It's gonna be sweet.
[243:39.54]Except I'm dead, kind of.
[243:45.89]That, like, scared me.
[243:51.13]I hear that squeak right there.
[243:53.36]That's how you land three consecutives.
[243:55.80]You know what I'm saying, guys?
[243:57.74]That Reaper is so mad he didn't just kill me.
[243:59.94]Let's do it!
[244:00.73]Let's go!
[244:02.40]Push.
[244:02.84]There's like two or three dead.
[244:03.59]It's just you.
[244:03.89]And I have no...
[244:04.57]I have eight health.
[244:05.29]I'm dying.
[244:06.48]You left me alone.
[244:07.50]And you're so... ...dupid.
[244:12.00]Do I have to do this whole thing by myself?
[244:17.43]Oh, behind you, Johnny.
[244:20.32]Oh, Genji's just got a little thingy.
[244:23.63]Please, don't move.
[244:28.53]Oh.
[244:34.68]Gonna win the game by myself.
[244:44.23]Don't worry, guys.
[244:45.25]Just winning the game by myself.
[244:51.59]Where are you going, Boo?
[244:53.72]I don't know this.
[244:54.50]I don't play this game.
[244:59.10]Oh, you actually hit someone.
[245:06.22]Mei looks fun.
[245:06.97]She is extremely fun.
[245:08.21]This fucking Reaper.
[245:09.80]Can someone go in with me, please?
[245:14.20]I know you're really happy you were Mei and you were on the point not doing anything.
[245:18.60]But let's push together.
[245:19.97]Here's the thing.
[245:20.57]Right now, you look real, real stupid.
[245:23.91]I've been doing extraordinarily well.
[245:28.19]Because their team is not even back there.
[245:42.84]In quotes, not doing anything.
[245:47.01]You're not.
[245:49.10]I'm just saying, you look real stupid right now.
[246:04.39]I got an ult here in like two seconds.
[246:06.71]I'm sorry he was dead.
[246:07.51]That's all that mattered.
[246:17.49]great thing 99 I got my hope if we want to do a push or something
[246:29.16]Oh.
[246:30.63]Someone just got pinged.
[246:32.42]Wow, are you serious dude?
[246:38.32]Dragon.
[246:43.30]Alright, we going in?
[246:44.77]What are we doing?
[246:45.89]I'm ready to go in.
[246:46.56]No, you're going in alone again.
[246:48.14]I'm not going in.
[246:48.83]I'm waiting.
[246:49.09]I'm seeing if...
[246:50.29]We're all dying in the front.
[246:51.45]This is exactly what happened last time.
[246:53.08]And you're like, oh, I'm back there alone.
[246:54.56]What's wrong?
[246:55.16]And we can't get through the front door.
[246:57.03]And you didn't even do anything back there.
[246:59.34]You didn't get a single kill.
[247:02.83]You hear what this guy's saying right now, everybody?
[247:06.44]You hear what this dude is saying right now?
[247:09.73]Frankly, I can't believe it.
[247:24.41]Why is Star such a child?
[247:26.11]I don't know.
[247:26.70]That's a good question.
[247:33.83]It's funny that you think that.
[247:35.44]I guess children have some of the most imaginative minds.
[247:40.14]Genji's just casually capping himself.
[247:54.65]And we won.
[247:55.22]There you go.
[247:56.67]Good job, guys.
[247:59.51]Nice work.
[248:07.31]But I mercy play the game.
[248:08.51]Fuck.
[248:11.88]This is him killing everyone while Jerma was thinking he was important.
[248:17.53]All I need is video evidence to speak for itself.
[248:19.67]I don't need anything else.
[248:21.08]I don't see any evidence.
[248:26.44]The people of Jerma's Shad are smart people.
[248:29.21]I don't think you can pass this by them and say that you gotta kill them.
[248:33.17]I don't see any evidence.
[248:41.73]Why is there such a mistempered adult?
[248:44.69]I don't know.
[248:53.34]No, guys.
[248:57.90]That was a beating.
[249:00.06]I think they just need to lower the value of an ultimate in play of the game.
[249:05.97]And they need to fix it so that it doesn't just choose the last thing that happened in a payload game.
[249:10.93]Re-instance it.
[249:11.57]Or like any game, it just takes like the last, oh, this guy got a kill and then they won.
[249:23.03]I might, I think I might, no, we already have a May.
[249:33.34]Thank you.
[249:50.67]Just throw in the towel.
[249:51.71]He'll never be happy That's what my psychiatrist said
[250:04.35]And your defenses.
[250:07.95]Do you remember his chat is mad?
[250:10.94]No, no one's mad.
[250:13.15]No, if anyone's mad, it probably is your chat.
[250:16.91]Well, you started it.
[250:24.05]By the way, I love the moon emote with the two hands.
[250:29.82]It looks perfect.
[250:39.03]What are you gonna play?
[250:39.65]Come on, don't leave us hanging.
[250:45.99]No, I can't do that.
[250:47.96]Jerma, you deserve a man that treats you right.
[250:50.15]You know who that man is?
[250:51.35]He's currently here.
[250:52.03]Man of action?
[250:54.93]He's currently in the car right now.
[250:58.07]I'm gonna be BooMan61.
[250:59.94]Oh, God.
[251:01.71]I'm leaving.
[251:03.31]Wow.
[251:03.56]Wow.
[251:05.53]Wow.
[251:06.57]He told you not to tell anyone.
[251:09.36]He'll be back.
[251:10.58]This is a joke.
[251:11.40]He just made a joke.
[251:13.67]He'll come back and he'll be like, got ya.
[251:20.56]See?
[251:20.88]Oh, see, he just wrote in the chat.
[251:25.50]I gotta use the bathroom.
[251:27.05]I'll be back in a minute.
[251:29.32]He said it's gonna be a long one.
[251:30.88]He had like three burritos earlier.
[251:36.09]Do some damage.
[251:37.83]You're ready to do some damage.
[251:38.72]You're ready to do some damage.
[251:40.02]You're ready to do some damage.
[251:41.35]Cool.
[251:42.27]You're ready to do something.
[251:43.88]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[251:45.53]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[251:48.22]Thank you.
[251:53.91]I just did a lot of... God, did I get like two people in that or something?
[252:00.34]Why were they both standing still?
[252:05.31]He was found dead the next morning.
[252:08.09]Jeez.
[252:10.68]They are doubles, Ari.
[252:12.51]A temple of Anubis.
[252:15.54]What are you talking about?
[252:16.91]You guys ready to have no fun?
[252:19.47]So we can get him.
[252:20.94]Watch this.
[252:22.92]Put this one on your fucking scorecard.
[252:27.70]Make sure to counter them with...
[252:30.46]What do we do?
[252:34.05]But what do we do?
[252:34.79]What's the strategy?
[252:36.28]I don't know.
[252:36.88]Reinhardt up and don't ever shoot them.
[252:39.05]Just keep the shield up.
[252:42.91]They're pushing last right now Stay behind
[252:54.32]There's one.
[252:56.44]Are you serious?
[252:57.29]Hell yeah.
[252:59.27]Holy shit, I'm alive somehow.
[253:02.58]Oh my god.
[253:06.86]Oh my god.
[253:09.51]We got fuckin' smoked.
[253:14.45]One Zarya.
[253:15.17]TWO Zaryas!
[253:17.74]That's just not fair.
[253:19.59]They didn't get it?
[253:22.21]And the Hanzo.
[253:25.47]The Dragon ult.
[253:27.98]They had it all.
[253:29.45]They had it all, man.
[253:30.52]Here's the funny thing about two Zaryas, right?
[253:32.51]Four people at one given time would not take any damage.
[253:36.97]Yes.
[253:37.23]Four people on their team would not take a point of damage.
[253:40.30]That was two medics uber-sawing each other.
[253:44.28]Look at this.
[253:45.98]Shields everywhere.
[253:52.76]Seriously, give that character the fucking stone called Stunna.
[253:56.10]And then do a three count.
[253:58.65]And she's in a wheelchair.
[254:03.07]like seriously that's that's the type of thing where you want to see stone cold stun the entire mcmahon family
[254:14.58]I just got streamed.
[254:16.65]But...
[254:18.83]That's getting embarrassed.
[254:23.08]I'm not embarrassed.
[254:23.86]I'm not embarrassed.
[254:25.27]Blizzard employees are embarrassed.
[254:26.79]I feel humiliated in front of all these people.
[254:32.20]They won in one minute.
[254:34.45]Well, they had Zaryas.
[254:35.74]We didn't have a Zarya.
[254:37.41]I know.
[254:39.16]How do you counter it?
[254:42.27]You also play Zarya.
[254:44.26]Also play Zarya or have a Mercy because your team's going to die and you can revive them.
[254:49.27]and then have Reinhardt.
[254:52.32]What if we had six maze chaining walls so that they can't walk through ever?
[254:58.28]On a rotation.
[254:59.09]That's plausible.
[255:00.55]Six Mays.
[255:03.70]I'm embarrassed.
[255:06.19]That was...
[255:07.26]I... Ugh, God.
[255:15.83]They just fucking walked all over us like a fat guy in golf shoes.
[255:23.19]I've paid for that one before too.
[255:25.30]I saw that.
[255:26.76]But you've paid for a fat guy to walk all over you in golf shoes?
[255:30.38]Yeah.
[255:33.37]Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[255:34.65]There's an ad.
[255:37.22]We both, like, replied to the same ad.
[255:41.98]I don't know.
[255:43.93]Oh, oh.
[255:46.35]Oh, God.
[255:54.56]The strategy I'm going to do this game is I'm going to sit right here, and I'm just going to go like this.
[256:01.83]They're gonna have no idea where I am.
[256:03.88]I'm gonna go like, one, and then not shoot.
[256:05.99]Then like, one, two, don't shoot.
[256:09.18]And if they shoot back?
[256:10.96]You're locked.
[256:14.74]What does this look like
[256:26.29]Morse code.
[256:37.39]get out of here what yeah
[256:51.58]Alright, I have to land a direct shot on somebody.
[256:53.62]Alright, there's three men.
[256:55.13]I have to hit this guy with a direct... Oh, thank god.
[256:58.23]You didn't.
[256:59.63]No, I didn't.
[257:00.22]I ran out of time there.
[257:02.50]I was going to say, within the time limit here, if the timer goes out, then it doesn't count.
[257:07.26]You know what time it is?
[257:08.08]I don't want to play Zarya.
[257:11.68]I will not play that character on principle.
[257:16.15]There's a guy called Boohoo.
[257:18.06]I don't like it.
[257:20.83]I'll just stand around and look at stuff.
[257:25.48]Can he not be in the game with us?
[257:27.79]No, I don't like playing Hanzo.
[257:30.46]I really don't want to do that with Devil's Eye.
[257:32.91]Really, I did it with MLC_St3alth, and I...
[257:35.00]I just laughed and spit into my hands.
[257:37.68]Ugh.
[257:40.92]What happened?
[257:43.01]Oh, Roadhog fucking fat ass.
[257:45.14]I'm not Roadhog.
[257:47.76]Can you hold down tab?
[257:49.75]It takes you two seconds to figure out that you were just misinformed.
[257:52.03]In real life, you are a rodent.
[257:54.56]Oh wait, Star, I don't think you were here when I talked about this.
[257:57.09]Come here.
[257:57.65]This is important.
[257:58.19]40 seconds, front door.
[258:01.85]40 seconds, front door!
[258:04.40]Alright, McCree, $60 million, right?
[258:07.13]$60 million, McCree.
[258:08.81]Alright.
[258:15.28]Why is he worth 25?
[258:15.92]25?
[258:17.51]How much is Drunkrat worth?
[258:18.53]How much is Drunkrat?
[258:19.54]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[258:20.64]25 million?
[258:21.44]That's unbelievable.
[258:23.07]Hold on.
[258:24.28]McCree is worth 60 million.
[258:26.38]Yeah, what is going on here?
[258:28.45]These two don't even equal one McCree.
[258:31.50]Unbelievable.
[258:33.89]By the way, I am Roadhog, so... By the way, I am Roadhog.
[258:43.83]Well, you said it does not play Roadhog.
[258:45.63]You said you called me a bunch of names.
[258:48.44]I know, that's why it's funny.
[258:51.13]Like, after I called you a bunch of names out by the way, like, yeah, I guess I am.
[258:54.63]I'm healing you, but you better go, like, drink your juice.
[258:57.64]Oh, we're all dead.
[258:58.66]Good job.
[259:00.59]You always say that when you're the only person that is not alive.
[259:12.62]I'd love to hurt him.
[259:14.85]Oh my god!
[259:17.94]That was a bubble and then a bubble.
[259:20.76]No going through that.
[259:26.04]Oh piss.
[259:27.42]Oh there's a sniper.
[259:30.12]Oh, there's a bubble.
[259:32.81]Someone didn't want to play Zarya.
[259:35.52]He just wants to play against him forever.
[259:42.05]Ah, Boo, it's your job to go jump on that sniper right now.
[259:45.77]Oh shit, I hit my head on the roof.
[259:50.95]Am I doing good?
[259:52.48]Go back to card games.
[259:59.74]Let's think of a plant hospital.
[260:04.20]I'm gonna eat you.
[260:10.27]Sniper down.
[260:15.10]He already has it again.
[260:16.38]I know.
[260:18.47]Oh, also, both times I got hit, like, through it.
[260:22.07]Well... Um, I would switch off Mercy, but we, um...
[260:27.77]Kinda need the support.
[260:31.84]Yeah, we kinda do.
[260:33.32]Because you guys are all at like zero health all the time.
[260:40.47]Yay, a kill.
[260:41.92]I've got killed like three times now.
[260:48.79]That we haven't even seen before we were here yet.
[260:51.88]Totally understood.
[260:53.23]Now it's turn.
[260:53.91]Fucking Jesus Reinhardt.
[261:01.31]Oh my fucking god.
[261:05.29]Point empty.
[261:07.00]Still over here.
[261:10.14]I just ulted him.
[261:17.09]Fuck it, we need to like get out of here.
[261:20.26]Oh, I'm so angry.
[261:22.05]Sniper up top.
[261:22.55]Sniper up top.
[261:23.75]I mean, Zarya would be really good here.
[261:26.34]Holy shit, there's too many people over there.
[261:32.62]Oh, that turret.
[261:33.51]Are you going to see me through the walls right now?
[261:35.15]Okay, now I can.
[261:40.70]Sniper's dead.
[261:45.59]So is our full team.
[261:51.35]I made the zoom out.
[261:54.11]Are we gonna get on it?
[261:56.36]Uhhh.
[262:01.88]Winston.
[262:03.06]You can jump over behind you, Foo.
[262:09.16]I can heal you.
[262:10.47]Behind.
[262:14.80]I've been hit by that ult every single time he's done it.
[262:21.76]Every single time.
[262:22.66]Was that Tracer?
[262:23.54]Got behind him.
[262:24.73]Yeah.
[262:25.65]Oh, just switched to Tracer then went...
[262:31.11]Fuck.
[262:40.62]Goodness.
[262:42.19]Uh, I have my ult.
[262:43.36]You guys can die a little bit.
[262:44.87]Okay.
[262:47.16]Okay.
[262:47.56]On the point.
[262:49.30]Get to the point, just get to the point.
[262:52.39]I'm gonna build it on the right.
[262:55.64]I didn't kill the sniper.
[262:57.41]I'm dead.
[263:01.79]I couldn't reach the other person.
[263:03.35]Yeah.
[263:04.72]Nice.
[263:07.05]We can't even get in the front fucking door
[263:18.24]Holy shit.
[263:24.31]I almost have Giga Bowser.
[263:29.11]haha I'm free up here you can't kill me I actually got it
[263:39.52]We just got stomped again.
[263:41.17]I'm really impressed by your play, man.
[263:48.93]What do you want me to do there?
[263:52.11]Their team was extremely coordinated and good.
[263:54.54]What do you do?
[263:56.48]You lose to better players, that's what happens.
[263:58.67]Uh, doubles are you?
[264:00.44]Someone didn't want to be a coordinated team.
[264:03.50]That's literally putting the game into a game genie.
[264:13.10]And you were yelling at me.
[264:14.49]You were making fun of me.
[264:15.28]And who's got the only card up there?
[264:20.07]You need to stop being so mean all the time.
[264:22.82]It doesn't suit you well.
[264:24.87]It does.
[264:26.84]It does.
[264:29.64]I think you're being mean to me for not accepting me for who I am.
[264:35.54]I think one or two more games should do it.
[264:50.02]Fat botanist.
[264:52.49]I forgot about that.
[264:54.43]The fat botanist needs to tell the KFC executive all these things.
[265:00.01]Whoever in the chat made that up,
[265:05.43]Somebody, like, came up with that and it was fucking hilarious.
[265:08.70]Like, absolutely hysterical.
[265:11.14]You win, like, joke of the day, for sure.
[265:24.04]You know who actually does kind of counter now is Bastion.
[265:28.36]Because you just shoot through her shields and insta-kill her.
[265:32.54]Do you?
[265:33.96]Does a shield bar off a damage or is it just like one second invulnerability?
[265:38.00]It goes off to the amount of damage it takes.
[265:39.71]You can end it early.
[265:41.48]Oh.
[265:41.98]But then that gives her the bonus damage.
[265:44.16]Yeah.
[265:45.39]Joke of the game.
[265:46.76]Joke of the game.
[265:49.98]Press Q for joke of the game.
[265:52.61]What is the joke of the game?
[265:53.94]Right now, what was the joke of the last game?
[265:55.58]The Fat Botanist.
[265:56.69]Oh, actually, no.
[265:57.23]What was the joke of the last game?
[266:00.00]Um...
[266:01.05]I don't remember.
[266:02.14]Your gameplay?
[266:11.02]I hope you get a virus.
[266:19.81]I hope you don't.
[266:20.68]That's not a good thing to wish on someone.
[266:24.99]My computer blue screens like right after you say it.
[266:29.75]I don't know if you're talking about a computer virus or a foodborne illness.
[266:32.72]They're all up top.
[266:33.48]Look at the coordination.
[266:34.29]Look at all the Hanzos they have.
[266:35.51]Oh, they have six Hanzos.
[266:38.18]Are we playing against a team of six?
[266:40.55]No.
[266:42.50]Alright, I bet you nobody hits me.
[266:44.60]Come on.
[266:47.18]Oh my gosh, it's like Lord of the Rings.
[266:49.06]Just hiding back here.
[266:50.79]Just gonna sit back here the whole game.
[266:53.23]I'm just going to... Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.
[266:55.40]I'm going to go in here.
[266:55.94]I'm going to go back to fucking the dinosaur time.
[267:00.03]It's all Hanzos except for, of course, they kept the Zarya.
[267:04.26]They have to.
[267:05.45]I know, they all switched.
[267:07.50]They just wanted to, like, rain from above.
[267:21.29]Ouchie.
[267:26.77]I'm so proud.
[267:27.63]I want that scrap, but I'm too scared of who's in this room.
[267:32.32]Discord?
[267:36.31]Is a Genji going around?
[267:52.02]I don't even know what the fuck is happening right now.
[267:56.10]I was inside of two people's bodies.
[268:05.65]Why does he not make level 3 sentry?
[268:07.66]Wow, you don't even know how to play Torbjörn?
[268:10.86]I don't have my ult.
[268:16.05]Jeez.
[268:19.41]pick it up pick it up pick it up get the armor oh god
[268:31.42]I actually thought it was gonna go down instantly, but it didn't.
[268:43.44]I'm going to build it up back here.
[268:46.99]Because they are just rolling.
[268:54.22]I need my Symmetra shield.
[269:05.49]Or I can't win.
[269:07.85]Oh god, they're all on it.
[269:09.06]Where's my old...
[269:11.16]I didn't know every single person was standing on it.
[269:13.40]I thought it was like two.
[269:33.96]Pass into the eye.
[269:40.86]Armor.
[269:41.52]Take it.
[269:41.76]Jesus.
[269:42.51]Just chaining healing ults.
[269:43.45]There's three coming around that way.
[269:45.64]One's dead.
[269:48.01]Need health.
[269:50.67]Bad.
[269:59.54]Hiya!
[270:01.13]Gotcha!
[270:05.17]Oh, fuck.
[270:07.64]Got a Junkrat.
[270:18.66]Hmm?
[270:21.37]Oh.
[270:22.98]Oh, cheers.
[270:25.95]Thanks!
[270:26.47]What a fucking grit.
[270:31.03]I didn't say mate.
[270:32.42]Okay, mate's more Australian, right?
[270:37.03]What would you say is more Australian?
[270:39.54]Might.
[270:40.88]Or... G'day.
[270:42.73]G'day.
[270:45.32]Alright, what's more Australian?
[270:47.11]Fosters?
[270:49.34]Yep, the answer is Faustus.
[270:59.08]Oh, Reinhardt, you...
[271:00.28]Thank you.
[271:05.41]I'll just...
[271:10.91]Scrap, scrap, scrap.
[271:11.99]Give it to me.
[271:15.95]Come get your armor!
[271:21.82]Oh my lord.
[271:27.40]Come get your armor.
[271:29.54]Okay, I assumed that every single person was going to run in for that Zarya ult.
[271:33.30]I guess not.
[271:35.32]Somehow.
[271:38.95]I assume the whole team was in that ult and they were going to come in.
[271:46.04]I don't know what happened.
[271:52.15]Save your life.
[271:54.06]I died.
[271:54.26]Oh, you did?
[272:00.10]The last second Zarya ball came by.
[272:07.74]Anybody going around the other side?
[272:10.41]Don't believe they are.
[272:12.64]Bollocks.
[272:15.58]Who's on it?
[272:20.95]Far in the sky.
[272:23.50]I wanted that scrap so bad, it was worth it.
[272:31.50]Is armor packs all over the place?
[272:33.77]Armor packs, pick it up.
[272:34.94]You don't have one?
[272:35.46]There's like two or three here.
[272:41.17]Literally right here
[272:51.14]I mean, positioning is more important than the armor, but I guess I'll give up my spot for it.
[272:56.76]Yeah, I would have killed Barret.
[273:02.35]I'm sorry, I might be ulting soon.
[273:04.72]Well, I have my ult too.
[273:06.41]So we all can ult at the same time.
[273:08.60]It'll be great.
[273:16.83]What the shit?
[273:19.51]Well, here we go.
[273:33.87]I have fucking shield.
[273:44.62]That's unfortunate Turn around
[274:01.60]Wow
[274:09.60]We're all dead.
[274:11.38]Can I say it that time?
[274:14.45]We're not all dead.
[274:15.21]We're not all dead.
[274:29.54]Just get it up.
[274:30.55]Just get it up.
[274:40.58]I'm going to have a bunch of packs here.
[274:45.42]Grab them up.
[274:48.12]Thank you.
[274:48.42]You put that on me as I was teleporting over here.
[274:51.05]You're a hero.
[275:02.23]Couple of head markers.
[275:04.94]Thanks for abandoning me, Reinhardt.
[275:06.43]That was pretty cool.
[275:09.32]Fucking turd.
[275:11.44]Turd snipper Nips
[275:19.68]What are you talking about?
[275:24.74]Really?
[275:25.00]That would have hit him right in the face.
[275:39.51]I've got my Molten Core.
[276:00.28]Yikes.
[276:05.15]Did I miss a sub?
[276:07.65]Whoever it was.
[276:09.32]You missed the cart.
[276:10.51]Whoever that was.
[276:12.99]Boo.
[276:16.83]I'm gonna like jump in and single-shot them in their Zen and what was the other one?
[276:21.40]Lúcio ult?
[276:22.06]Oh, whoever just subbed, thanks for subbing.
[276:24.24]I missed you.
[276:25.10]Oh no, fangs.
[276:25.69]There we go.
[276:25.99]Hey fangs.
[276:27.12]Thanks for subbing.
[276:32.34]Oh, you just killed like the whole team?
[276:34.07]I killed four people with one rocket.
[276:35.69]Yes, you saw it here first.
[276:38.95]The guy who did 42% of the team's damage.
[276:42.25]I did see it.
[276:50.89]Oh, whatever.
[276:51.39]That was a close one.
[276:52.49]Can't even get an epic card over here for 42% out of 6 players.
[276:56.39]Can't.
[276:57.31]No.
[276:59.18]So entitled you are.
[277:01.03]One more game and I'll be 40.
[277:02.68]And then the stream will end.
[277:06.38]So make this one count.
[277:14.88]Make this one count.
[277:19.84]You know?
[277:24.92]Yay, Hollywood!
[277:26.76]Wait, it's a skirmish, isn't it?
[277:28.94]Aw, thank god.
[277:51.03]What are you guys going to do to make it count?
[277:54.67]I don't know, maybe 42% of the team's damage.
[278:02.86]I'm talking about this one, not the last one.
[278:06.55]Kia, keep living in the past, Star.
[278:08.26]We're talking about the present right now.
[278:10.49]Do it again.
[278:10.89]We're talking about the present.
[278:11.77]I don't need a support on the team.
[278:13.24]I don't care.
[278:13.68]I don't need a fucking, like, a real tank.
[278:15.42]We do have a support on the team.
[278:16.47]It's a Metro.
[278:18.17]It's a Metro.
[278:19.90]They should switch Symmetra to defense.
[278:22.76]In all seriousness.
[278:23.85]So people can stop saying, we have a support.
[278:28.07]What he meant to say is they need to make Symmetra better.
[278:34.94]Symmetra is awesome right now.
[278:38.62]And I think they switched off of Symmetra anyway.
[278:41.19]Well, let me explain what I mean by better.
[278:44.22]In my opinion, she's excruciatingly boring to play.
[278:48.49]I like her.
[278:50.36]I just feel like you kind of just don't really, you just kind of stand around and hold right click on sometimes.
[278:59.46]Well, you don't understand the nuances of some extra I'm sure I don't that's why we have that's why we have different opinions I
[279:11.41]just go to the point just rush to the point run to the point Jerma go go go go go go go go go go go
[279:23.94]That was a horrible idea.
[279:25.19]Yeah, what are you doing?
[279:26.38]They were... All six of them were like at our spawn and...
[279:30.73]One of us could have just gotten to the point.
[279:34.93]And that one person would have died.
[279:36.34]You start it too late.
[279:38.39]What are you even talking about?
[279:46.71]Hey, sorry I'm right and you're wrong.
[279:53.58]I don't even have a response to anything you're saying right now.
[279:58.25]I need one hit.
[280:00.17]One hit.
[280:09.54]do-do-do-do
[280:23.75]Let's get out of here.
[280:26.60]Wow, right when I clicked.
[280:31.01]Are you serious?
[280:37.72]Okay.
[280:39.01]Guys, did I even jump on my screen?
[280:43.64]I don't remember jumping in the middle of my ult, but did she like launch me in the air?
[281:01.26]I gotta go.
[281:02.84]I'm gonna go Winston.
[281:10.71]I'm gonna go Winnie the Pooh.
[281:25.78]Battle of the shields.
[281:27.92]He's got a better shield than me, but...
[281:36.16]There are a couple dead.
[281:38.03]There are a couple dead.
[281:39.98]Oh, that Junkrat really just saved the day right there.
[281:47.36]I really like Bastion, by the way.
[281:50.70]Yeah?
[281:51.48]I don't blame him enough.
[281:52.85]Oh, Jesus.
[281:55.58]Big stun.
[282:07.41]How many Winstons do we have?
[282:08.18]Two.
[282:09.45]Two Winstons.
[282:10.29]Yeah.
[282:22.84]We're doing the barrier exchange of the path.
[282:28.11]Solid tech.
[282:31.22]Oh my god, every single person is in that top right room.
[282:34.42]Jesus.
[282:35.95]Spray.
[282:36.65]Spray!
[282:39.31]That was... Oh, my goodness.
[282:41.12]If only somebody had, like, something explosive in there.
[282:51.35]To the right, to the right, to the right.
[282:53.19]Ooh, he killed a few people.
[283:04.99]Where did we go so wrong?
[283:09.05]I'm not just gonna die, you know.
[283:11.45]Where'd we go so wrong?
[283:21.37]Thank you for the heels
[283:32.24]I just wanna play one game with this Nozai.
[283:35.17]It's gonna be hard to find.
[283:37.68]I've only been playing against the same group of people.
[283:40.53]I know, but is he like, you know...
[283:43.23]Do they finally adopt their own dashable strategy?
[283:46.66]I have a big monkey.
[283:49.90]I almost have my Santa.
[284:03.02]Oh my god, I beat the absolute dog shit out of her too.
[284:13.89]The Bastion's on the right side.
[284:15.42]Right side?
[284:16.98]Yeah, the thing that's making all that noise.
[284:19.99]I love how you like, if you listen to me, you always know where Bastion is.
[284:25.67]I got stuck, like, on the fucking door.
[284:27.25]That was annoying.
[284:37.41]Has Alt Winston ever killed anything?
[284:39.89]It's actually really hard to get kills with it.
[284:41.31]It doesn't really do a whole lot of damage, and you knock the people away from you.
[284:57.17]Let's get to the right.
[285:07.64]Holy opus.
[285:12.19]What a fucking mess.
[285:14.24]Seriously, that was a mess.
[285:20.66]yeah it is like a super like steroid left for dead tank that moves like freaking you guys are kidding me
[285:29.83]Walk out into it.
[285:33.63]Oh my fuck.
[285:35.21]I am pissed off about that.
[285:36.60]I am actually angry right now.
[285:42.11]What the hell?
[285:44.29]Why didn't that pin you?
[285:46.68]Oh my god!
[285:48.19]Glad I expected that crap.
[285:56.57]He's pinned me.
[285:58.62]That was...
[286:02.60]You know what the worst thing about the Zarya really is?
[286:05.81]The fact that it's one thing to protect somebody.
[286:09.52]It's one thing to protect your teammates or protect yourself.
[286:12.59]But if somebody can't even attack or they make you do more damage That just like sucks such ass
[286:23.69]If Azaria puts a shield on her, you literally have to just look at her and run.
[286:29.97]I'm having fun playing Bastion right now because when she does it, I rip people like I have a shield.
[286:36.17]Tear it down and kill it.
[286:38.84]Awesome.
[286:42.29]I probably would have killed that.
[286:50.93]Thanks, but you know someone wants to be a fucking giga Bowser.
[286:54.80]Hey get the restaurant.
[286:56.74]He's dead I
[287:03.20]Oh, you got a problem with the up-down strategy?
[287:16.41]It's her move.
[287:28.46]Okay, they're like mad now and they have their own bastions so I'm gonna switch and just kill him
[287:39.07]Watch out, he's gonna try to charge in here.
[287:51.86]too many people
[288:01.23]Almost have ult again.
[288:07.13]Me too.
[288:08.08]I got it.
[288:09.12]Oh, shit.
[288:09.61]Oh, it's okay.
[288:11.64]Stay in the bubble.
[288:15.09]Oh, push, push, push, push, push, push.
[288:17.08]We got it.
[288:18.26]We won a game.
[288:19.48]We did it.
[288:25.59]Such salt.
[288:28.23]Stealth, we're streaming.
[288:29.08]Stop, stop.
[288:31.50]I didn't... Nobody kicked him.
[288:32.55]He just did that.
[288:37.46]That's the reason why we just won the game.
[288:50.40]Oh, look at this guy.
[288:51.39]Look at this guy going big.
[288:54.54]Playing them.

[289:31.84]And there's a spray.

[289:42.46]I've got two boxes to open.
[289:44.31]I already have it.
