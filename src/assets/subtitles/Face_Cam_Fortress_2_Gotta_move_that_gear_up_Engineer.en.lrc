[00:08.56]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.28]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2!
[00:13.38]Playing on Gully Wash with the Frontier Justice, the Mini-Sentry, and the pistol.
[00:20.40]Whoa!
[00:22.42]Hi, Heavy!
[00:24.55]I can't believe you didn't kill me.
[00:26.61]Gully Wash is a map that I don't normally play on, and it's not because I don't like the map, it's because you don't really see it in the server browser too often.
[00:34.73]But it's a five control point map, it's pretty interesting.
[00:37.83]And we are getting pretty much rolled right now.
[00:40.01]Oh, get planted!
[00:43.66]Get pla- What?!
[00:45.14]How did I- Come here!
[00:46.90]Get over here!
[00:48.06]Oh!
[00:48.82]Give me that!
[00:49.48]Yeah!
[00:50.48]Yeah!
[00:52.68]Oh, I was so pumped up right there, I almost just got like, aww.
[00:55.92]Is this milk?
[01:00.92]It's milk!
[01:01.90]It's not Dr. Pepper.
[01:03.54]What magician put that in front of me?
[01:06.74]Milk is good, though.
[01:07.46]I suggest you drink it.
[01:09.12]If you do not drink milk, does it body good?
[01:12.38]It's good to have every so often.
[01:13.68]I drink it usually once a day.
[01:15.45]Maybe, give or take.
[01:17.47]Why am I not putting down... I should have put down my own stuff right there.
[01:20.93]I'm sitting there waiting for a teleporter, and I'm an engineer.
[01:23.23]Let's go for some more punches.
[01:25.85]Get that thing out of here!
[01:29.80]Getting kills, getting kills, getting kills.
[01:35.80]Come on.
[01:37.41]Give me some more kills, nice!
[01:39.21]Mini-Sentry for the win, hell yeah.
[01:42.45]Hell freakin' yeah.
[01:45.37]That means if it dies, I'm gonna get the min- no, not the mini, I almost said mini crits!
[01:49.07]Full crits, baby, what are you talking about, Jerma?
[01:53.13]I still didn't put- I'm putting Dispenser in here.
[01:56.67]Forget that.
[01:58.23]Dispenser is going up in this room.
[02:03.12]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[02:04.97]Let's see what's out here.
[02:07.05]We're still pushed back here.
[02:08.01]We're gonna move up.
[02:10.31]No, no.
[02:10.95]You good?
[02:11.41]Now I'm gonna do it.
[02:12.33]Here we go, baby.
[02:13.93]Let's plant it on some more people.
[02:15.35]Get some... Oh!
[02:18.13]There!
[02:18.83]Come on.
[02:19.09]Come out here, Pyro.
[02:21.21]Come here.
[02:23.47]Come here, you.
[02:24.30]Come here, you.
[02:27.72]I didn't kill that guy?
[02:29.70]Bananas!
[02:31.72]Oh, that guy's got crits!
[02:34.26]And a Pyro!
[02:35.06]Nooooooo!
[02:39.58]Dammit!
[02:40.02]Alright, I'm gonna build that guy's tele- Oh, I am so stupid.
[02:46.07]I've had an opportunity to build that guy's teleporter up, and I haven't done it yet.
[02:50.67]I need to drink some more milk.
[02:55.32]Milk!
[02:55.80]Milk!
[02:56.32]Milk!
[02:56.82]Milk!
[02:58.16]Alright, here you go.
[02:59.70]Now that it's there, it's level 3.
[03:01.54]I'm gonna build one too, don't worry.
[03:03.67]So we can have two there.
[03:06.73]Jerma, being a bad engineer.
[03:08.13]Let's just go.
[03:11.41]Gotta get out the front lines.
[03:14.35]They are going to cap this, or are they?
[03:20.83]Good, I'll take that.
[03:21.55]I'll take that.
[03:24.09]Get mine up here so we can get more people at the front lines, baby.
[03:27.79]What the hell is going on?
[03:29.68]What?
[03:30.02]What just happened?
[03:33.26]Scare.
[03:35.02]Nice, like, scary ghost heavy jumping around the corner.
[03:38.87]Damn.
[03:40.73]I gotta put my game face on here, guys.
[03:43.15]Because they're gonna cap this right now, probably.
[03:46.71]Get your game face on.
[03:49.53]Or build up at the last point, because they're coming in.
[03:53.59]Oh, Pyro's gonna cap it if we're not careful.
[03:55.75]Where'd he go?
[03:56.13]Where'd he go, you son of a bitch?
[03:57.95]Oh my god, it's the same heavy!
[04:02.55]Dude, that Heavy has popped around a corner and, like, boo, scared me and killed me, like, three times in a row now.
[04:10.20]And that's gonna be it!
[04:10.92]Somebody get on the bike!
[04:17.34]Oh, well.
[04:20.09]I wanna watch that back.
[04:21.07]I wanna see that Heavy jump around the corner and, like, spook me.
[04:26.01]Get that built.
[04:28.62]Teams just scrambled, so that's a good thing.
[04:30.66]I think.
[04:32.40]Maybe not.
[04:33.22]Maybe they'd scramble into the same teams.
[04:36.54]Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!
[04:41.53]Got my teleporter.
[04:44.97]This is gonna be my last run here.
[04:46.99]This last life.
[04:47.77]I'm gonna give myself one more life.
[04:50.01]And we'll see if I can't pull something out here.
[04:51.90]Not just die 50,000 times.
[04:54.10]Hey, are you a real spy?
[04:55.10]Yes, you are.
[04:58.39]This one's gonna go over here.
[05:00.17]Right over this corner.
[05:03.05]Right, no, right here.
[05:05.59]Gotta watch that back area.
[05:07.27]Because that's a bad place to be.
[05:15.39]Whack whack whack whack whack whack whack whack!
[05:18.63]Let's go, Jag!
[05:19.71]You gotta shine here, Jag!
[05:25.54]Get that spy too, woohoo!
[05:27.84]This is what I'm talking about.
[05:29.00]Oh no!
[05:30.34]Oh no!
[05:31.54]Uber!
[05:32.07]Uber and a scout!
[05:34.29]I can't do much right here.
[05:35.75]I gotta wait till that's gone.
[05:38.93]No, no!
[05:39.89]Get it up!
[05:40.31]Get it up!
[05:40.65]Come on!
[05:41.21]Come on!
[05:41.85]Get it up!
[05:43.30]I don't care if it goes down.
[05:44.18]It's worth it.
[05:46.92]Nice.
[05:47.44]Nice job.
[05:49.02]Keep him off.
[05:52.52]Come on here.
[05:55.94]Don't want to completely run out of metal here.
[05:59.72]You are a scout.
[06:01.52]A real one.
[06:04.98]Making bacon.
[06:07.38]Team's pushing up, I think.
[06:10.16]I think so.
[06:12.05]Moving up.
[06:13.91]Do I dare move this?
[06:16.25]Is the question here.
[06:17.19]Let me get some full metal.
[06:22.05]I'm moving up.
[06:22.97]I'm gonna do it.
[06:24.03]I had this in my last life.
[06:25.03]I'm gonna do it.
[06:25.67]You know, if I get myself killed, I get myself killed.
[06:27.79]But I'm going for, like, this room right in here.
[06:31.69]Like, right here.
[06:35.85]This is probably a really bad spot.
[06:38.27]But it's all good.
[06:40.93]Oh, we got a caft.
[06:41.63]We got a caft.
[06:42.79]Move it up.
[06:44.96]Oh, boy.
[06:45.68]Oh, boy.
[06:46.10]Come on.
[06:46.96]Get it up.
[06:47.32]Get it up.
[06:47.62]Get it up.
[06:47.94]Come on.
[06:48.12]Before this guy comes around the corner.
[06:51.72]We're good.
[06:55.10]Oh, I wish I had the Wrangler, because that's not close enough.
[06:59.58]One sentry, man.
[07:00.54]This thing has been alive.
[07:01.80]I can't believe no one's taking this thing down.
[07:06.06]Gotta push up.
[07:11.10]Demoman!
[07:11.82]Nah, I need a... You know what?
[07:15.38]Where's the teleporter exit?
[07:17.08]Right there.
[07:19.02]Go.
[07:20.00]Hurry!
[07:21.86]Get out of here.
[07:23.22]Oh, no.
[07:26.76]Let's move this thing up again.
[07:27.88]Let's move it, like, into, like, right here.
[07:31.62]When they turn this corner, it is going to unload on these guys.
[07:34.67]There we go.
[07:38.01]I got the backup here.
[07:40.13]I got the backup.
[07:40.77]You know what?
[07:41.09]I gotta destroy this.
[07:44.67]And I don't have enough metal, but I'm gonna build a dispenser up here.
[07:48.98]For the crew.
[07:49.72]Oh!
[07:52.01]Where's the metal?
[07:54.45]There it is.
[07:55.99]Go, go, go!
[08:00.28]Jump up!
[08:02.04]Oh, this one life has lasted a fairly long time.
[08:05.56]Don't worry, when he walks out this door, watch this.
[08:08.46]Hey, Heavy.
[08:11.42]Ooh!
[08:12.30]He almost took it out.
[08:15.41]Build, build, build, build, build.
[08:18.33]You bastard!
[08:20.83]Oh, I gotta pick this up.
[08:21.77]That was lucky.
[08:29.78]This thing has stayed alive since so many times when it should go down.
[08:33.04]This is just a complete stalemate.
[08:40.97]Hey, Scout.
[08:42.95]You're not gonna get this, buddy.
[08:45.17]I'll plant it on you.
[08:46.90]Man, I got a sentry kill.
[08:47.94]Hell yeah!
[08:50.36]Man, I lived longer this one life that I said I was doing one life than the whole damn time I played this run.
[08:58.32]Can I sneak this in here?
[08:59.60]Let's go.
[09:00.06]Here we go.
[09:01.14]Suicide mission.
[09:01.96]Here it comes, guys.
[09:02.68]Suicide mission.
[09:03.80]Suicide mission!
[09:06.69]Oh, it's a suicide mission!
[09:08.13]It's a suicide mission!
[09:10.66]Oh!
[09:11.46]Oh!
[09:13.54]I don't even care.
[09:14.68]Let it die.
[09:15.98]I'm coming around the corner.
[09:16.78]I'm gonna kill a bunch of people right now.
[09:20.04]Watch this.
[09:20.42]Here we go.
[09:20.76]Here we go.
[09:25.09]Bang!
[09:27.27]Oh, you.
[09:28.61]Oh, you!
[09:29.49]Sneaky snake!
[09:31.82]Let's go.
[09:32.88]More crits, baby.
[09:33.80]More crits.
[09:34.26]Are you a spy?
[09:35.06]This heavy's gonna open this door.
[09:40.08]Spy!
[09:43.01]Got eight crits still.
[09:43.99]Eight crits.
[09:45.45]Get that level one out here.
[09:49.89]Kill that son of a bitch.
[09:52.83]Sweet.
[09:54.06]Are we gonna win right now?
[09:55.42]Is this it?
[09:55.86]I think we did it.
[10:00.66]Oh, 126 damage!
[10:02.60]Somebody get on that, let me get on this.
[10:09.44]Oh!
[10:10.54]Oh!
[10:11.19]Oh, flex the muscles!
[10:12.57]Flex the muscles right there, my god!
[10:16.29]Oh, baby!
[10:17.57]Wow.
[10:20.29]Well, that's a good note to end on for sure.
[10:22.67]Thank you guys so much for watching.
[10:23.73]Really do appreciate it.
[10:24.48]This Facecam Fortress 2.
[10:26.00]I'm out of milk.
[10:27.68]Gotta get more.
[10:28.28]But that's it, guys.
[10:29.02]I'll see you all soon.
[10:30.24]And of course, take care, everybody.
[10:32.58]I can't believe I just did that.
