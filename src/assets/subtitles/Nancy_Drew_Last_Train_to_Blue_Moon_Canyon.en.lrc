[ve:60.16.100]

[00:18.04]Hey, what's happening?
[00:19.23]How are you?
[00:19.96]What up?
[00:30.61]Yeah, today we're going to be playing Nancy Drew and the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon.
[00:43.38]This was the one that was chosen a few days ago.
[00:48.83]Last week, whatever.
[00:57.47]I don't know how good this one is, people seem to say hey this one's pretty good.
[01:03.62]Let's give it a solid three to four hours, see how we feel.
[01:07.62]I might beat the whole dang thing.
[01:12.80]I'ma beat the whole thing.
[01:18.89]Nobody said it was good.
[01:21.69]You know, Nancy Drew is now public domain.
[01:23.94]Okay, I keep hearing about this.
[01:26.40]Nancy Drew is public domain?
[01:28.51]Is it?
[01:39.39]The first two books, I think.
[01:41.10]Yeah, I think the stuff from her interactive is definitely not in the public domain.
[01:47.68]This is an iteration of Nancy Drew, right?
[01:52.20]Maybe the original... couple of novels or something?
[01:58.22]There's old Nancy Drew movies which are public domain.
[02:01.03]Huh.
[02:03.48]Interesting.
[02:05.18]The books are from like 1930.
[02:06.61]Interesting.
[02:12.03]Although public domain is weird because
[02:16.94]The Three Stooges movie, that short film, whatever, is in the public domain.
[02:24.75]Song of Sixpence is in the public domain.
[02:27.56]But I think that, I don't know, the version that maybe we watched on stream
[02:32.28]It was, I don't know, because that's been shut down on the archive channel and stuff.
[02:37.71]But that film is in the public domain.
[02:41.21]I've looked it up like three times.
[02:47.85]This dude is still talking about the Three Stooges, yeah.
[02:56.58]Just wait.
[02:56.96]Everybody will come around.
[02:58.13]Don't worry.
[02:59.07]They always do.
[02:59.72]Only a small part of it was muted in the VOD.
[03:05.03]The content claim system on YouTube is weird.
[03:08.24]Who knows, man?
[03:09.37]At this point, I have no fucking idea.
[03:12.66]But...
[03:14.77]Uh, we're not talking about that today.
[03:16.34]We're talking about Nancy Drew and the come on wind Canyon.
[03:21.84]I like that title.
[03:23.67]I was sitting here going, come on.
[03:24.57]Because you guys are going to be mad about me for puzzles.
[03:26.30]So I'm like, alright, come on, Gwyn.
[03:27.51]Enough.
[03:29.91]That's where the title came from.
[03:31.16]That was the creative vision.
[03:38.65]Any funny or weird dreams?
[03:40.09]Not really.
[03:43.48]It's been pretty boring up in the, uh, the noggin during the sleep time.
[03:50.38]Alright, these games are a huge pain in the ass to capture, so pray that it worked.
[03:56.74]I also have to figure out how I'm gonna... Because I was thinking about doing Casino Inc. soon.
[04:01.81]And the movies.
[04:03.32]Windows 11 does not like these.
[04:06.70]Windows 10 and Windows 11 really just hate these old games.
[04:10.44]So what I'm probably gonna do, I'm either gonna do like a virtual machine, or I'm gonna get an old Windows 7 laptop.
[04:18.84]and just like dual pc stream from it because it is such a huge pain in the ass I was trying to get casino inc to run
[04:28.19]And there's like one guy that has been making a community patch for it to actually get it to physically work on Windows 11.
[04:35.52]That's unacceptable.
[04:40.76]These games should work.
[04:45.44]Windows 11 is, come on, man.
[04:55.23]Okay, I guess the one thing you could say is, well, why would you want a PlayStation 1 game to work on a PS5?
[05:01.49]It's like, fuck, that's kind of true.
[05:05.82]But you know what I think is the most annoying thing about the backwards compatibility of Windows applications?
[05:10.25]Just listen to me for a second.
[05:11.36]It kind of like baits you, because if you put a PlayStation 1 disk into the PlayStation 5 tray,
[05:21.35]It would be like, what is this?
[05:24.21]I don't know what this is.
[05:25.94]Error.
[05:26.52]Error.
[05:27.48]What are you doing?
[05:28.99]If you open up like a Windows XP application in Windows, it kind of opens.
[05:34.88]And it's like, dude, oh, welcome to Casino Inc.
[05:39.35]It kind of works, but it just doesn't.
[05:43.24]So they kind of, you get kind of baited.
[05:45.41]It's like, oh, it's such a letdown when it kind of, it sort of half works.
[05:50.81]But there's always something so awfully wrong with it that needs, like, community mod support.
[05:57.53]So, it is kind of weird.
[06:02.27]I should be able to play every single game on one console.
[06:09.88]That would be fucked up.
[06:12.26]It works on Linux?
[06:14.99]Yeah.
[06:15.31]So, like, am I gonna sit here and say, like, I can't believe my Windows 7 application doesn't work on my PlayStation 5.
[06:22.49]But it is becoming an increasingly more pain in the ass as we get further away from Windows XP and Windows 7.
[06:31.08]to get some of this stuff to actually work.
[06:34.03]Which is funny because if you think about the last time, like five or six years ago, I played Casino Inc.
[06:38.85]It worked.
[06:39.95]And I didn't really have to do anything weird.
[06:42.40]Now we're on Windows 11.
[06:44.21]It don't fucking work.
[06:49.20]emulation well that's what I'm saying like I could do a virtual machine and work it through it that way which is I I've done that in the past I have done that before
[06:58.75]So I might just do a VM.
[07:00.56]It's very possible.
[07:04.33]But anyways, yeah.
[07:05.17]Well, hey, that's...
[07:06.88]I'll figure it out by the end of January, right?
[07:13.57]Don't ever go to Windows 11.
[07:15.04]I will never switch.
[07:16.07]I'm on Windows 10.
[07:17.10]See, I remember being you.
[07:19.19]I was the exact guy typing in this Twitch chat when Windows 7 was going to lose support from Windows officially.
[07:29.08]I was like, no, I'm never leaving.
[07:30.58]I will never leave.
[07:31.62]There's nothing you can do.
[07:33.19]I will never, ever uninstall this.
[07:34.74]I'll always be on Windows 7 for the rest of my life.
[07:37.23]And then like kind of 10 years went by and I was like, oh fuck, I kind of can't do that anymore.
[07:46.17]Windows 8.1 was fine.
[07:47.78]Windows 7 was great.
[07:49.23]Windows 7 is probably the best Windows.
[07:51.47]I know people say XP.
[07:53.36]People say, oh, everybody loves XP.
[07:54.95]But I think Windows 7 is like the perfect version of Windows.
[08:03.67]I loved Seven.
[08:08.73]And then 8, they just kind of flushed the whole operating system down the toilet.
[08:12.72]And then they skipped 9.
[08:14.59]and kind of went to 8.1 and then they went to 10 and then I don't know.
[08:23.26]I think they just stop numbering shit.
[08:26.54]Just, it's Windows.
[08:30.40]It's the PlayStation.
[08:31.38]You know what I mean?
[08:32.21]Do we really have to call it the PlayStation 6?
[08:34.50]It's getting kind of weird, right?
[08:36.02]Do we need to keep numbering everything?
[08:40.07]10 fixed 8, then 11 destroyed it.
[08:42.40]I actually didn't mind 10.
[08:43.29]I thought 10 was fine.
[08:45.98]Anyways...
[08:51.14]Forget about any of this.
[08:54.18]How you doing?
[08:55.53]It's time to play some Nancy True.
[09:01.69]And this is the last train to Blue Moon Canyon.
[09:03.72]The audio, I'm going to tell you right now, you should lower your volume and I'm going to give you five seconds to do it.
[09:10.49]More like 20, because I know someone's probably running from the bathroom or something.
[09:15.13]Because I cannot alt-tab.
[09:16.68]This game needs to be captured a very specific way and I cannot alt-tab.
[09:20.48]So I've tried to make it as good as possible.
[09:24.91]So, are we all ready?
[09:30.20]Are we all ready?
[09:32.05]It should be fine, but I'm not messing around.
[09:36.85]Here we go.
[09:37.34]It is.
[09:39.20]I'm bringing it onto the screen.
[09:43.96]In five seconds, three, two, one.
[09:48.84]Watch that volume.
[09:54.81]It's okay.
[09:58.62]Here it is.
[10:01.20]So this is Nancy Drew.
[10:02.61]I'm excited.
[10:03.21]I'm looking forward to this.
[10:06.67]It's way too loud.
[10:13.96]It's not loud.
[10:16.23]It's quiet, actually.
[10:17.24]Look at how low it is.
[10:21.08]Would you consider what you're hearing right now to be like 8%, 12% and like 18%?
[10:30.67]Here I am at the railroad station, along with a handful of other detectives, about to board a train bound for Hoosier.
[10:36.00]How we doing?
[10:39.21]I think it sounds pretty good.
[10:43.97]Music up a little.
[10:45.87]Thunder up.
[10:48.14]Voice up.
[10:49.08]Better.
[10:50.53]Alright, here we go.
[10:55.07]New game.
[10:55.71]Welcome to my latest case, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon.
[10:59.81]To start, choose junior or senior detective.
[11:02.70]If you're new to adventure,
[11:03.42]Alright, so am I doing Junior Detective?
[11:06.97]I think I gotta do Junior Detective, guys.
[11:11.03]I'm not doing Senior Detective.
[11:12.68]I think I'm doing... We gotta do the...
[11:14.61]I gotta do the...
[11:15.55]I gotta do the... Too many Ts in a row.
[11:19.66]That's coward?
[11:20.50]No, it's not because I don't want to solve the 5,000.
[11:23.94]It's too, it's hard.
[11:25.44]These games had people with two parents beside them being like, okay, let me look at that.
[11:29.64]Uh, sweetheart, I'm not sure.
[11:30.82]Let me, let, let, let dad try to figure that out.
[11:32.65]No, I don't, it's just me.
[11:34.94]As always, your mission is to solve the mystery.
[11:37.78]You're going to step into my shoes and- You're an adult, though.
[11:40.57]It doesn't matter.
[11:41.23]It'll be up to you to decide my every move.
[11:43.82]Click on next to continue.
[11:45.57]I'm sorry.
[11:46.21]I cannot turn to mom and fill my cheeks up and go.
[11:50.44]Like, this is all you.
[11:51.71]I'll be back.
[11:53.22]I'm gonna go cut the lawn.
[11:55.38]That is a fill your cheeks with air, blow it out like... Whoa, this is... See ya.
[12:06.31]Alright, what does it want me to do?
[12:08.64]How do I fail the tutorial?
[12:15.17]Welcome to my latest... As always, your mission is to solve the mystery.
[12:20.24]Click next.
[12:21.89]I was not paying attention.
[12:23.03]I was talking to you.
[12:24.34]I was speaking to you.
[12:27.07]you can turn around in a circle to see the whole room.
[12:30.34]We'll use this room as an example.
[12:32.33]Move your cursor to the left or right edge of the screen and you'll automatically move in that direction.
[12:36.94]Got it.
[12:38.13]Dude, don't need both parents for this.
[12:41.97]allows you to advance in the direction you want to go.
[12:44.89]Likewise, a back arrow allows you to take a step back.
[12:49.09]sometimes up and down arrows are available too give it a try fine I always carry my magnifying glass with me to scan for when you want to go back to where you came from
[12:58.68]or turn around.
[12:59.81]When the magnifying glass turns into a question mark you can talk to someone.
[13:03.86]when it becomes a hand you can use it to open and close things pick up objects and move things around
[13:09.73]Now turn to the right, step over to the table beside the bed, and roll your cursor over the key that's on the table.
[13:16.89]Nice, got it.
[13:17.81]Okay, I think I know how to do this.
[13:22.83]Okay, I would have thought this was settings, so I'm glad.
[13:30.99]Whenever you've added something new, if the alt tab is active, you'll see all the objects you've collected during the game.
[13:37.42]Now click on the tab with the eye on it.
[13:39.87]When the eye tab is active, you'll see only those objects which you might wanna look at over and over again, like letters or messages.
[13:46.96]Now click on the hand tab.
[13:48.87]When the hand tab is active, you'll see the objects that you can use to manipulate other objects.
[13:54.13]Yeah, so this is how you combine.
[14:00.67]Whoa!
[14:11.46]To return an object to your toolbox, just click on the tool icon, then click on the open toolbox, and the object will go back into storage.
[14:19.36]you can close the toolbox by clicking on the square in the upper right hand corner
[14:26.12]Here I am at the railroad station along with a handful of other detectives about to board a train bound for- Better?

[15:22.34]Nice.
[15:22.77]Alright, delete that.
[15:23.89]Wait, I can send that to somebody?
[15:28.33]Am I gonna send this to a landline?
[15:31.72]Picture has been sent.
[15:33.27]Okay, well I just sent this to a landline.

[16:40.30]Okay, cool.
[16:41.01]Alright, I get it.
[16:46.53]Let's go.
[16:48.79]Welcome to my latest case.
[16:50.61]Last string to Blue Moon Canyon.
[16:51.88]I'm not picking Junior Detective.
[16:53.10]I'm sorry, guys.
[16:54.59]That's just the way it is.
[16:55.55]No fucking way.
[17:02.88]This is a puzzle game from 2000.
[17:05.05]They're going to be crazy.
[17:07.07]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[17:11.40]You can't, I don't think you can change this either.
[17:13.28]Come on, it's funny though.
[17:18.54]But what if it's way too hard?
[17:22.75]Okay, I'm gonna do the first...
[17:24.37]This is a stupid idea.
[17:27.78]Senior is going to take hours.
[17:29.73]Somebody just said that.
[17:30.92]And by the way, that person's username was Nancy Drew Let's Go 2005.
[17:37.39]Just to be... Just to be very fucking clear with you.
[17:42.18]Dear Hannah, here I am at the railroad station along with a handful of other detectives about to board a train bound for who knows where.
[17:49.25]I don't care, I'm going junior.
[17:52.63]I'm doing fucking 12-year-old.
[17:54.82]Alright, pay attention.
[18:02.70]The Hardy Boys are in this?
[18:03.92]This is a Marvel crossover?
[18:07.22]Some people can be a little too rich and a little too famous for their own good.
[18:12.87]Well, you got so loud.
[18:18.61]Let's get started.
[18:19.98]Okay, I, again, am Laurie Gerard.
[18:23.45]And the first thing I want to do is thank you all for coming.
[18:27.57]John Gray.
[18:28.76]This is too loud.
[18:29.50]I am so thrilled that you're taking time out from that TV show of yours to do some ghost hunting here with us.
[18:36.87]I mean, Ghost Chasers is like the best cable show ever.
[18:40.91]Okay, Ghost Chaser?
[18:41.70]And Charlena Purcell.
[18:43.35]I cannot tell you how much I adore those romance novels you write.
[18:47.90]Your characters just seem so real.
[18:51.10]And all that stuff you know about the Old West?
[18:53.97]You are just awesome!
[18:56.08]And Tino Balducci.
[18:57.95]Only the most famous police detective in the country.
[19:01.32]And then there's Frank and Joe Hardy.
[19:04.13]They're amateur detectives.
[19:06.38]My dad and their dad are old friends.
[19:08.79]What?
[19:09.03]And we don't get a five-paragraph intro?
[19:10.21]And you must be the other amateur detective their friend?
[19:12.14]Natalie?
[19:12.94]Nancy.
[19:13.76]Nancy Drew?
[19:14.77]Whatever.
[19:15.85]Alright.
[19:16.83]I'll bet you're wondering where we're going.
[19:18.68]Well, we're going to Copper Gorge, Colorado.
[19:22.26]Why?
[19:23.34]to solve the mystery of what happened to Jake Hurley, the man who originally owned this train.
[19:29.62]Because, see?
[19:30.57]One day in 1903, his train was found in a place called Blue Moon Canyon.
[19:38.02]which was out in the middle of the Nevada desert.
[19:41.62]Only the engineer was on board, and he was dead.
[19:45.40]As for Jake Hurley...
[19:47.20]He had disappeared from the face of the Earth.
[19:52.10]Oh, and two more things.
[19:53.63]Before he disappeared, Jake was rumored to have found the richest gold mine in the world.
[19:58.51]Oh, what?
[19:59.13]And the train he owned, this train, his wife Camille died on it while they were going to the gold fields.
[20:06.12]It was rumored to be haunted.
[20:12.20]I don't know where I'm going, I can't see!
[20:17.78]She's dead!
[20:20.35]People should never go tampering with things they don't understand.
[20:23.36]Oh brother.
[20:25.23]Nobody seems to care?
[20:27.82]It's okay.
[20:28.87]Everybody just stay calm.
[20:30.77]No need to panic.
[20:32.46]I'll get to the bottom of this.
[20:35.42]They've seen some shit.
[20:36.40]Look at that smile.
[20:37.57]They know.
[20:40.98]They're like, really?
[20:44.66]The room went dark and somebody disappeared?
[20:46.41]Like, okay.
[20:47.68]This is an amateur book.
[20:49.17]Lori Gerard is a young woman whose only goal in life
[20:51.82]We did this in our Volume 1, Episode fucking 6 book series.
[20:55.95]We're on Volume 30 now.
[20:57.74]Okay.
[21:00.63]You're not concerned.
[21:03.63]So she just wants to be famous.
[21:05.32]Okay, so she thinks this is just horseshit.
[21:09.67]So she's just pranking us.
[21:11.39]So you think her disappearing like that is just some kind of publicity stunt?
[21:15.43]I just think she couldn't resist showing off in front of all of us minor celebrities.
[21:20.29]What was your name again?
[21:21.65]Nancy Drew.
[21:23.04]You and I have actually met.
[21:24.91]Sort of.
[21:25.64]Look at that old laptop.
[21:34.55]Hmm.
[21:35.57]You don't remember me, do you?
[21:37.30]Hmm.
[21:37.96]Okay.
[21:45.19]Alright, what about everybody else here?
[21:46.58]Have you ever met Laurie's other guests before?
[21:49.63]Psst!
[21:49.75]Nancy!
[21:52.36]Come here!
[21:52.94]What's up, Joe?
[21:53.54]Uh, excuse me for a second.
[21:55.83]Hold on.
[21:56.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:56.73]We gotta...
[21:59.06]Here I am at the railroad station along with a handful of other...
[22:02.69]The game got too loud.
[22:04.55]Alright, I should save the game, right?
[22:12.33]I no longer have access to the menu.
[22:15.20]Can I only click the menu once an hour or something?
[22:19.77]What?
[22:21.16]Can I not save the game?
[22:26.10]Alright, what do they want?
[22:30.69]Hey, Nance.
[22:31.47]Where have you two been?
[22:32.98]I followed Tino Balducci.
[22:34.33]And I went after John Gray.
[22:35.95]He went straight to the room in the car that used to be Camille's and didn't come out again.
[22:39.95]I could hear all these weird noises coming from inside.
[22:45.42]Uh, what was he doing?
[22:55.41]He found something on the floor right where Laurie was standing when the train went dark.
[23:00.10]I saw him pick it up and put it in his pocket.
[23:01.89]Oh, so he...
[23:03.04]Okay, so did you say anything about it?
[23:04.89]Did you ask him about it?
[23:05.79]Did you say, hey, what was that?
[23:06.60]I tried to talk to him.
[23:07.30]He just kind of brushed me aside and said something snotty like...
[23:09.54]I'm on the job here, Junior.
[23:11.10]So just go back to the playground and stay out of the way.
[23:13.96]In case you two hadn't noticed, we're not getting a lot of respect around here.
[23:17.32]Nobody screamed.
[23:23.74]Ha ha.
[23:27.78]been undercover Joe let it go what charlina have to say she's not the only one how can you say that
[23:37.21]To be fair, though, if I was a detective and somebody was like, we're the American teens against crime.
[23:41.53]We're here to investigate what just happened.
[23:43.16]I'd be like, guys.
[23:45.04]Somebody might be fucking dead.
[23:47.56]Please get out of the way.
[23:55.64]Which one is Frank?
[23:59.98]Who just talked?
[24:04.84]Who, okay, who just spoke?
[24:06.64]I don't know the, the Hardy Boys, I only know the ones that do Swanton bombs off the top rope.
[24:13.05]Frank is the one on the right.
[24:17.04]Okay, so he said that.
[24:18.78]Who said what?
[24:20.76]I want to go after the guy that picked up the thing on the ground.
[24:23.89]So I would agree with Frank, right?
[24:34.48]I don't know.
[24:35.19]No, Frank said it was fake.
[24:36.94]No, Joe...
[24:37.48]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[24:38.12]I agree with Joe.
[24:40.17]I kind of agree with you.
[24:41.60]You've gotta be kidding.
[24:44.51]Well, sorry dude.
[24:49.37]Let me talk to the engineer.
[24:50.27]Has anyone talked to the engineer?
[24:51.54]Not that I know of.
[24:53.28]Then I'm going to head up front and tell him what's happened.
[24:55.77]Maybe he knows something we don't.
[24:57.97]Alright, you got it.
[25:02.57]Break.
[25:04.18]Goddammit, I can't save the game.
[25:06.41]This is actually a disaster.
[25:17.52]Escape?
[25:18.46]No.
[25:18.84]Escape doesn't do anything either.
[25:22.14]Shit.
[25:24.75]I might...
[25:26.83]I think I have to restart the game.
[25:30.37]Because this was literally...
[25:32.50]I could just skip through all this dialog.
[25:35.89]We have to be able to save, right?
[25:37.68]We're so early.
[25:38.89]M for menu?
[25:40.10]No, it doesn't work either.
[25:41.15]I think you have to click it.
[25:42.05]Let me restart it.
[25:44.44]We can't have this be bad.
[25:47.02]You know what I'm saying?
[25:50.11]I gotta get out of here.
[25:56.51]I need access to that menu.
[26:01.15]This is gonna be like a four to five, six hour experience, not being able to save the game once.
[26:07.08]That's not going to fly.
[26:11.18]Watch that audio, by the way.
[26:18.42]It's a hardcore run.
[26:21.07]I don't want to do a hardcore Nancy Drew run.
[26:22.70]It sounds horrible.
[26:26.59]Okay.
[26:27.49]I think that's good now.
[26:30.89]Is there a...
[26:33.92]Wait.
[26:35.97]Load and save game.
[26:38.82]Okay, name your... Alright.
[26:40.51]Let me save it immediately after getting in there.
[26:45.74]I just clicked, I got senior detective.
[26:51.19]railroad station along with a handful of other detectives about to board a train bound for who knows where.
[26:56.61]The only person who knows where we're going is Laurie Gerard.
[27:00.15]That's the young woman who invited everyone.
[27:02.36]See, I can click it.
[27:04.01]I hope I can't just click it one time ever.
[27:10.07]Use it wisely.
[27:20.18]Wish me luck.
[27:20.98]Love, Nancy.
[27:21.91]Alright, let's go.
[27:22.29]Well people, now that our little orientation tour is over, let's get started.
[27:27.55]Okay, I, again, am Laurie Gerard.
[27:30.73]And the first thing I want to do is thank you all for coming.
[27:34.31]Why is she so much louder?
[27:35.87]John Gray.
[27:36.62]I am so thrilled that you're taking time out from that TV show of yours to do some ghost hunting here with us.
[27:44.06]Famous TV show.
[27:46.45]Ghost Chasers.
[27:48.31]That's John.
[27:50.42]She writes romance novels.
[27:54.41]And she knows a lot about cowboys.
[28:00.41]Detective.
[28:09.15]And then there's Frank and Joe Hardy.
[28:11.06]They're amateur detectives.
[28:12.71]Frank and Joe, amateur detectives.
[28:13.84]My dad and their dad are old friends.
[28:16.09]And you must be the other amateur detective, their friend?
[28:18.98]Let's go.
[28:19.40]Natalie?
[28:20.18]Nancy.
[28:21.01]Nancy Drew?
[28:21.73]Let's go.
[28:23.06]Alright, I'll bet you're wondering where we're going.
[28:26.44]Well, we're going to Copper Gorge, Colorado.
[28:29.76]Why?
[28:30.28]To solve the mystery of what happened to Jake Hurley, the man who originally owned this train.
[28:36.87]Because, see?
[28:37.87]I'm going to take a look at everybody now.
[28:42.71]When the lights go up, we're going to see who did it.
[28:46.51]of the Nevada desert.
[28:48.86]Only the engineer was on board, and he was dead.
[28:52.63]As for Jake Hurley,
[28:54.46]He had disappeared from the face of the Earth.
[28:57.83]Take a look at everybody.
[28:59.32]Oh, and two more things.
[29:00.85]Before he disappeared, Jake was rumored to have found the richest gold mine in the world.
[29:05.63]Okay, well, it's not the Hardy Boys.
[29:06.79]And the train he owned, this train...
[29:08.70]His wife Camille died on it while they were going to the gold fields.
[29:13.51]It was rumored to be haunted.
[29:20.36]It's her.
[29:27.54]People should never go tampering with things they don't understand He probably thinks it's a ghost Oh brother
[29:35.03]It's okay.
[29:36.07]Everybody just stay calm.
[29:37.96]No need to panic.
[29:39.65]I'll get to the bottom of this.
[29:42.68]Alright.
[29:44.12]Well, Nancy, you're up on all that social etiquette stuff.
[29:47.50]What are you supposed to do when your hostess vanishes into thin air?
[29:50.24]I think he already knows who did it.
[29:53.29]If I don't seem concerned, it's because I'm not.
[29:56.33]Laurie Gerard is a young woman whose only goal in life is to be famous.
[30:00.09]she craves attention and habitually uses her father's considerable wealth to get it
[30:05.42]I'm gonna save it right when I get in.
[30:11.39]and hope I don't get no access to the menu because that would be terrible Nancy Drew you and I have actually met
[30:18.84]I wonder if there's a... Maybe I should hit escape instead of clicking it.
[30:28.17]You don't remember me do you?
[30:30.99]No
[30:34.70]Okay.
[30:35.28]Her arms are too short.
[30:38.12]Alright, here we go.
[30:40.69]Come here!
[30:41.13]Alright, so... Yeah, so see, I have access to this now.
[30:46.66]I'm terrified.
[30:47.51]I'm not going to click it yet because we don't need to save the game right now, right?
[30:51.02]I'm terrified that I'm only going to be able to click this once.
[30:53.97]Which is not horrible, because as long as I can save the game, I can reboot the game and get access to another save.
[31:01.37]So that's not a horrible thing.
[31:03.07]Hey, Nance.
[31:03.83]Where have you two been?
[31:05.33]I followed Tino Balducci.
[31:06.70]And I went after John Gray.
[31:08.30]He went straight to the room in the car that used to be Camille's and didn't come out again.
[31:12.28]I could hear all these weird noises coming from inside.
[31:14.95]Okay.
[31:15.53]Ghost guy went into the room and was playing with his ghost meter.
[31:20.67]and detective found the thing on the ground.
[31:24.53]Any idea what he was doing?
[31:26.38]I was just about to go in, but the next thing I know, Joe's got my arm in a vice grip and is dragging me back here babbling about how Balducci's our guy.
[31:34.37]He found something on the floor right where Laurie was standing when the train went dark.
[31:37.62]I saw him pick it up and put it in his pocket.
[31:39.91]Then he left.
[31:40.93]Did you see what it was?
[31:42.40]When I tried to talk to him, he just kind of brushed me aside and said something snotty like, I'm on the job here, Junior, so just go back to the playground and stay out of the way.
[31:49.91]In case you two hadn't noticed, we're not getting a lot of respect around here.
[31:53.53]Can't we at least tell Balducci that we do stuff for ATAC?
[31:56.02]What TF2 class do you think Nancy mains?
[31:58.39]A spy?
[31:58.93]What, are you dumb?
[32:01.44]You're dumb?
[32:02.04]Why are you even asking a question like that?
[32:04.17]Are you dumb?
[32:04.93]Joe, let it go.
[32:06.40]What'd Charlena have to say?
[32:08.49]She thinks Laurie is faking this whole disappearance thing.
[32:11.39]She's not the only one.
[32:12.56]How can you say that?
[32:13.76]You heard Laurie scream.
[32:14.71]Anybody can scream, Joe.
[32:16.54]Especially girls whose fathers have given them acting lessons along with everything
[32:20.02]Alright, stop distracting me.
[32:21.37]I need to pay attention.
[32:23.80]Why do you hate that guy?
[32:24.90]I'm just fucking with him.
[32:27.21]Alright, uh, I agree with Joe.
[32:31.09]Alright, here we go.
[32:33.09]See ya.
[32:33.62]Which I call.
[32:47.86]Alright, wait, can I get their phone number and then send them a picture of themselves?
[32:55.02]Who is that?
[32:57.49]Wait, who is that?
[33:01.25]Bess Marvin?
[33:05.76]Okay, I can't call them.
[33:06.74]Yeah, I can.
[33:12.95]Hi, Bess.
[33:14.08]George, get over here.
[33:15.16]It's Nancy.
[33:16.44]It's about time you called.
[33:17.85]What's up?
[33:18.59]What's up?
[33:19.89]You're the one who's on the train with a bunch of famous people.
[33:22.94]Oh, I'm sending her pictures of how cool I am for being here.
[33:30.74]As curious as I am, she's been begging me to call you ever since she got here, only because you've been driving me crazy.
[33:39.07]I can't hang up the phone.
[33:40.62]I was trying to.
[33:43.75]boys are doing?
[33:44.91]Why do you think she hasn't called?
[33:46.60]What do you think Laurie Gerard is wearing?
[33:48.84]Oh George, that is so not true.
[33:51.39]I couldn't care less what Laurie Gerard is wearing.
[33:53.74]Alright!
[33:59.59]already, would you?
[34:00.98]Bess, calm down.
[34:02.56]Look what you did.
[34:03.30]You got paint in my hair.
[34:04.83]I'm sorry.
[34:05.49]You know, actually, that looks kind of cool.
[34:10.51]I don't give a shit about any of this.
[34:12.57]There's been a murder.
[34:15.31]George, I kid you not, you should seriously think about doing some major highlights in that color.
[34:19.89]What color is it?
[34:23.12]Alright, I'll talk to you later.
[34:28.81]I'm not sitting in the menu listening to this person.
[34:33.16]Okay, that person is there if you don't know how to do the junior puzzle, and that's fine.
[34:41.34]Hello, I'm one of the passengers and I just thought you should know that Laurie Gerard has disappeared.
[34:47.84]I mean, so... Did you know that was gonna happen?
[34:51.80]Hey, all I know is I take orders from Miss Gerard, okay?
[34:56.24]Right now my orders are to get this train to Copper Gorge non-stop.
[35:00.11]And until Mr. R tells me otherwise, that's what I'm gonna do.
[35:04.06]What if she's gone?
[35:06.43]But Laurie may not even be on the train anymore.
[35:09.04]Look, Mr. Arnn may not be a rocket scientist or anything, but even she knows better than to jump off a moving train.
[35:17.20]So she's in on it.
[35:23.03]She's in on it.
[35:24.05]It's a bunch of bullshit.
[35:24.99]There's gonna be hidden cameras everywhere.
[35:27.58]Alright, square duck.
[35:30.80]I gotta remember that.
[35:34.09]Square duck.
[35:38.90]Good.
[35:39.61]Alright, what about over here?
[35:44.10]True.
[35:47.09]Okay, let's go.
[35:52.15]Yep.
[35:52.85]Alright.
[35:53.18]Flippy fins, freshly canned salmon.
[35:55.61]Fresh from a hand from the deep.
[35:58.32]Wholesome, satisfying salmon.
[36:00.13]Fancy sockeye.
[36:03.36]J.R.Ruffian Sons, owners, Bellingham, Washington.
[36:08.62]So these were salmon canners.
[36:10.05]Can I keep this?
[36:16.33]It looks like there's something behind this painting, but I can't seem to move it.
[36:20.27]Alright, we'll move it.
[36:21.99]Pearl Bar.
[36:25.00]Sadie Crawford.
[36:28.06]Are these both left?
[36:32.51]Left, left?
[36:34.15]Where's the right one?
[36:47.59]Okay, I- am I- is this safe?
[36:51.32]What the hell am I doing?
[36:55.41]Gem.
[36:59.95]Wait, can I use the pencil to like wedge out the painting?
[37:03.57]I gotta come back with a wedge.
[37:06.42]Emergency break.
[37:07.33]I feel like I can't if I I need to save the game right guys because I want to press this
[37:16.63]Alright, pray that I can click the menu again after this.
[37:22.23]Train.
[37:23.05]Save.
[37:25.55]Your game has been saved.
[37:27.02]Yes.
[37:27.64]Alright, we're fine.
[37:28.68]We'll see what happens.
[37:29.75]Oh, please.
[37:31.11]What the fuck?
[37:42.41]pretty fucking hard.
[37:51.20]Uh, alright, well we don't- she was actually pretty smart about it, alright.
[37:56.22]Alright, so let's go investigate.
[38:05.73]Nothing?
[38:12.40]Oh, I need four numbers to four numbers.
[38:15.29]And there's what, 10,000 possible combinations.
[38:19.27]OK, guessing could take me a while.
[38:21.34]So we need to get top.
[38:23.48]This is definitely some kind of molding somewhere.
[38:31.27]You know what I'm saying?
[38:32.09]That's gonna be like the corner of a door.
[38:35.95]Alright.
[38:42.84]What's this?
[38:43.78]A tale of two dolls.
[38:45.81]Ill-tempered Edna could not get her way.
[38:49.86]She couldn't get Alice to come out and play.
[38:52.49]I can't, I'm too tired, is what Alice said.
[38:54.75]I just want to go straight back to bed.
[38:58.06]Edna angrily tried to make herself heard, but all that came out was one two-part word.
[39:04.29]Why, I'm not your mother, yawning Alice replied, till Edna the Terrible finally gave up and died.
[39:13.62]Cried.
[39:22.85]Wait, that's the code!
[39:23.74]No, it's not.
[39:36.84]That's not the code.
[39:37.63]You're wrong.
[39:48.99]Oh shit.
[39:55.74]Can I pick any of them up?
[39:59.08]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, it's up here.
[40:12.18]I got it, I'm a junior detective, I got it, don't worry.
[40:49.67]boom wait oh something's wrong
[40:59.04]Wait, what's wrong with this?
[41:02.65]Wait, what's wrong with this?
[41:04.78]This is wrong.
[41:26.17]Boom!
[41:36.32]What?
[41:46.83]Is that wrong?
[41:56.55]Is the corner not correct?
[41:58.88]Hold on.
[42:00.03]That looks right.
[42:02.18]That does not look right.
[42:10.45]Yeah.
[42:11.36]Pickaxe and lamp with Buell for safekeeping.
[42:14.91]To open what's closed,
[42:16.60]Lead is the key.
[42:18.59]Or is it... Lead is the key.
[42:20.57]Okay, left... Well, let me read it.
[42:22.62]Left pickaxe and lamp with...
[42:24.53]Mule for safe keeping.
[42:28.23]To open what's closed, lead is the key.
[42:34.37]Pickaxe and lamp are with Yule.
[42:41.07]I need lead to open what is closed.
[42:50.89]That doesn't even help me at all.
[42:54.60]I've seen you struggle with easier ones of those.
[42:57.82]It's a new year, man.
[42:58.78]It's a new day.
[43:01.10]Alright, what about all the way down?
[43:15.04]Ooh.
[43:16.97]Oh, you're the ghost guy.
[43:21.92]Pleasure to meet you.
[43:24.29]I've seen your TV show.
[43:25.92]Then I don't have to explain what I'm doing.
[43:29.29]Uh, you're measuring the ghosts in the room.
[43:34.19]Oh, heck no.
[43:35.35]Why, you're measuring the whoosie-whotsism with your trusty gizmometrometer thing.
[43:41.97]Right now I'm taking time-lapse electromagnetic readings and recording background noise.
[43:46.62]This was Camille's private car.
[43:48.03]Is it weird that the biggest red flag possible is to...
[43:56.04]to immediately start to think that a ghost did this.
[44:00.38]Okay, if like I'm with a bunch of buddies or a bunch of people that I've met, oh yeah, we're all like people.
[44:03.93]Oh, you're like an author.
[44:05.21]And the lights go out and somebody gets like grabbed or like killed.
[44:09.29]the first thing I'm gonna say is not oh that probably it could have been a that could have been a ghost
[44:15.67]We're in the real fucking world, man.
[44:17.82]Like, what do you mean it could have been a ghost?
[44:20.11]You mean it could have been you?
[44:22.64]That's the goofy shit that the guy that did it says.
[44:26.57]Like, we're not looking for ghosts, man.
[44:27.61]We're looking for, like, a kidnapping or something.
[44:29.67]Like, this is fucked up.
[44:30.67]Like, you've been playing with, like, ghost shit?
[44:33.01]This is real.
[44:35.88]Do you really think that a moving train can be haunted?
[44:39.08]Sure.
[44:39.43]A train is basically nothing but a living space on wheels.
[44:42.46]And just like a house or a hotel, its walls can capture and hold energy, however infinitesimal, whatever its source.
[44:49.21]You see, what to most people are ghosts are actually temporary distortions in local electromagnetic fields.
[44:56.15]caused by the presence of residual psychic energy generated by the person or persons who frequented that particular locale.
[45:02.98]That's my working theory, at least.
[45:05.31]So the blood on the ground and the blood smeared on the side of the car is... Where did that come from?
[45:14.46]That's a little hard to swallow.
[45:17.17]It's all very scientific.
[45:19.27]But the fact is, Lori's missing, and I for one am doing everything in my power to find her.
[45:24.80]Okay.
[45:26.01]Yeah, Charlene thinks it's a joke.
[45:34.30]Charlena Purcell thinks Laurie is just playing some kind of joke on us.
[45:38.36]Charlena Purcell writes romance novels.
[45:41.73]End of comment.
[45:44.99]Alright, who would you trust more in this scenario?
[45:48.11]The guy doing ectro...
[45:50.00]actual magnetic uh ghost readings or the like romance novelist I don't know man
[46:05.19]Okay, I would say at least this guy is trying something.
[46:15.83]What if it actually is a ghost though?
[46:17.24]Okay, what do you think of the detective?
[46:20.72]What do you think of Tino Balducci?
[46:22.52]I kinda feel sorry for the guy.
[46:24.64]After catching those bank robbers, he can't just be a good cop anymore.
[46:28.12]He's gotta be a great cop.
[46:29.86]So I have to perform under that kind of pressure.
[46:32.27]Anyone can write novels.
[46:33.68]Crazy people hunt ghosts.
[46:35.39]I'd like for you to flip that and think about it again.
[46:39.91]Flip what you just said.
[46:44.37]Any crazy person can write a novel.
[46:46.64]Any regular person can catch ghosts.
[46:49.51]You understand?
[46:50.85]Like, I think it doesn't matter.
[46:54.14]Anyone can just do anything.
[46:57.13]Okay?
[47:01.33]Is Lori a friend of yours?
[47:03.21]You don't have to be crazy to hunt ghosts.
[47:06.66]And you don't have to be, you know, not anybody can just write a novel.
[47:10.85]But sometimes they can.
[47:12.00]That's inspirational.
[47:16.65]Wait, he's kind of based for that.
[47:26.20]All I'm saying is, like, you could be a dumb fucking writer novel, and you could be a dumb fucking go-catch-ghosts.
[47:32.85]You can also be smart and catch novels.
[47:35.08]You can also be fucking really smart and write ghosts.
[47:37.89]It doesn't matter.
[47:38.47]Anybody can just do anything.
[47:42.47]Maybe she planned it that way.
[47:44.58]You mean so we'd concentrate all our efforts on finding Jake Hurley?
[47:48.45]Possible, although she really doesn't strike me as being the planning type.
[47:54.00]Okay.
[47:54.80]Okay, alright, I'm picking the novelist.
[48:01.44]Never mind, everything I said is completely wrong.
[48:04.05]No wonder the fucking power went out, because this dickhead is sapping up the fuse!
[48:09.42]She's fine!
[48:10.31]It's these two did it.
[48:11.49]This guy, look at all the electronics.
[48:12.93]This guy's blowing fuses.
[48:18.92]Game?
[48:19.16]So let's go.
[48:32.91]They don't give me a second to do it.
[48:58.27]It didn't fucking go!
[48:59.86]What?
[49:01.78]Hey, buddy, you're like, piece of shit jumping game is bribe... is... sucks.
[49:12.38]What the hell?!
[49:19.07]You gotta do it so much- I was doing it fine!
[49:26.72]I was gonna say is broken, but I didn't want him to think I broke it.
[49:29.96]And I'm not even in the room with him.
[49:42.65]Yeah, what's the reward?
[49:55.50]Okay.
[49:59.87]J G G E G A G E E D F E D. Is that how it works?
[50:18.01]Smashing up his toy.
[50:22.72]Alright, what else is in here?
[50:24.42]Whoa, here we go.
[50:27.13]Is it gonna piss him off?
[50:35.08]Don't do that, please!
[50:36.57]Those microphones I set up over there are very sensitive.
[50:40.20]Just about took out my eardrums.
[50:41.97]Well, I didn't know it was... Why is this... Why would you connect a piano to...
[50:49.12]This guy's fucked.
[50:50.64]Why is there a piano connected to your headset right now?
[50:54.22]Why do you have a channel set up, an audio channel for this?
[50:57.17]Right now.
[50:58.09]Please don't.
[50:59.60]No, no, no.
[51:00.63]Alright, fine.
[51:01.38]Goodbye.
[51:07.89]Okay.
[51:08.98]Thank you for giving the doll we called Teddy Eberhardt a home.
[51:13.28]Alright, this doll, stuff about dolls.
[51:21.79]Looks like some kind of sewing sampler.
[51:24.13]Like Monopoly?
[51:24.83]There's a relationship between those symbols and those numbers.
[51:29.96]Alright, wait a minute.
[51:31.99]Dude, where does Pass go?
[51:33.48]Alright, 22 is Apple.
[51:34.54]8 is...
[51:35.86]I'm taking a picture with my phone.
[51:36.89]I don't give a fuck.
[51:44.85]I'm just taking a picture with my phone.
[51:52.46]Okay.
[51:54.82]Uh, yeah, I see duck.
[51:57.11]One is duck.
[52:00.86]Have we seen any other animals?
[52:01.86]We've seen a moose or something, right?
[52:05.57]Yeah, that square duck right there, which is one.
[52:12.65]We've got also owl cherry.
[52:17.18]Why do we have Owl Cherry?
[52:18.56]Seven, ten.
[52:24.36]Seven, ten.
[52:25.80]For what?
[52:26.27]A different car?
[52:35.61]It's locked.
[52:36.97]Well, let me open it.
[52:40.82]Thomas O'Neil.
[52:43.51]OK.
[52:45.71]Looks like Camille was teaching herself how to play the piano.
[52:48.52]Oh, this is how you play the piano.
[52:49.70]Alright.
[52:50.31]I'm taking a picture of this with my phone.
[52:57.10]My fucking phone just died.
[52:58.92]What the fuck?
[53:00.87]My phone's actually dead.
[53:02.14]Can somebody take a screenshot of this?
[53:05.66]There's a phone in the game.
[53:06.93]Oh shit, this is perfect!
[53:09.37]No, I gotta always zoom out.
[53:13.93]Zoom out!
[53:26.10]This sucks because I cannot alt tab ever.
[53:30.18]Did I get it all?
[53:37.55]You need to unenhance it.
[53:38.55]I can't.
[53:38.95]Go back.
[53:40.09]Okay, wait, wait.
[53:49.50]Alright, that's good.
[53:50.65]That's good, I got it.
[53:53.84]Getting rid of that shit.
[53:57.78]Okay, cool.
[53:59.91]We got 710.
[54:04.22]I wonder what's under here.
[54:05.52]Oh my God.
[54:06.19]And what the deal is with those weird looking bolts.
[54:09.02]Looks like I need a special tool.
[54:10.77]Pencil?
[54:16.30]Alright, so that's all that's down here.
[54:17.42]There's something here, too.
[54:24.55]Is that a hot dog under there?
[54:27.84]Uh, that's right, Nancy Drew.
[54:38.74]Uh...
[54:42.99]Uh, no.
[54:45.86]No, I want to stay on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
[54:50.54]You, uh, heard about those bank robberies I solved, right?
[54:56.56]I sure did.
[54:57.45]Yes, I sure did.
[54:59.29]Don't want to hear about it, so I'll just tell you.
[55:06.55]But after forcing their vehicle to a stop, confronting them despite the fact that they were armed, and giving chase, I single-handedly made the call.
[55:16.54]Nice job.
[55:19.61]Oh.
[55:21.14]I heard all they had was a plastic knife.
[55:24.25]I heard that they stopped because you accidentally... Yeah.
[55:26.06]I heard they stopped because you accidentally rear-ended them.
[55:30.62]You heard wrong.
[55:32.55]You see, Nancy, when somebody does something really remarkable,
[55:35.58]Ah, dude, the stress damage that... disappeared over his head.
[55:40.67]Reporters, late-night comedians, even some of my fellow officers.
[55:45.91]All have been spreading vicious lies about me.
[55:48.70]Why?
[55:49.44]Because they've never done anything remarkable in their sorry little lives, and they're jealous.
[55:53.63]Okay, you should look around in here lots of interesting stuff.
[55:57.36]This was Jake's private car.
[55:58.72]You know
[55:59.30]Alright, so detective has got something to prove.
[56:01.90]Look, I'm going to fake this.
[56:03.91]Oh, look, she's gone.
[56:05.57]But I found her.
[56:06.52]I solved the mystery.
[56:08.47]And I'm going to invite two of these Aqua Teens here.
[56:13.53]So I can prove that the real detectives know what they're doing.
[56:16.98]And like the two people with like the 500 novels don't know.
[56:20.53]I can see that.
[56:22.14]So, what do you think happened to Lori?
[56:24.85]She could have been kidnapped, she could have been tossed off the train, she could be hiding from us.
[56:30.27]But I obviously won't know which until I've gathered all the facts.
[56:36.04]Could be the old lady because she needs excitement.
[56:37.63]Well, it could be the old lady to get an idea for her novel.
[56:41.00]could be the other guy to prove that ghosts are real, right?
[56:44.69]Like, look, I caught this electromagnetic thing over here, and that's where I found her, and she was a ghost.
[56:50.37]Everybody's got something to prove.
[56:54.97]So you're gathering facts?
[56:57.12]Of course.
[56:58.00]It may not look it because that's my style.
[57:00.17]I'm a low-key kind of guy.
[57:01.88]But hey, don't worry.
[57:03.44]I'll know the facts when I know the facts.
[57:05.87]The truth can't be told.
[57:06.33]What did you find on the ground?
[57:08.78]I understand that you found something on the floor in the dining car.
[57:12.31]Um...
[57:21.64]where do you think it came from like a bug you've been lying there for a hundred years may have served a purpose back then but now worthless
[57:29.84]Oh, I thought he meant it was like a bug.
[57:36.91]Okay, so it has the number three on it.
[57:45.99]Oh, thank you.
[57:48.10]What else can I do for you?
[57:50.11]Talk to Charlene.
[57:50.77]Have you had a chance to talk to Charlene Purcell?
[57:53.38]Now, why would I want to do a thing like that?
[57:56.89]What?
[57:57.25]Okay.
[57:59.51]I can't stand those sappy books she writes.
[58:02.05]And seeing as I said as much during an interview on national TV once, it's a pretty safe bet she doesn't like me.
[58:08.45]okay what about the the ghost guy have you talked to John gray the ghost guy total quack only reason I talked to him would be to arrest him for fraud
[58:18.61]Okay.
[58:20.11]You got a stick shoved up your ass?
[58:23.14]Alright.
[58:24.33]Can't all just hang out and...
[58:26.59]Okay.
[58:28.83]What do you got in here?
[58:29.74]Periodic table.
[58:31.61]A book.
[58:32.41]Gemstones and how to identify them.
[58:36.00]Wait a minute.
[58:37.96]Wait a minute.
[58:39.91]The thing... Where's the green one?
[58:42.98]Olivine?
[58:43.47]Emerald.
[58:54.58]and a deep green variety of Barrel, which gets its color from trace amounts of Chromium.
[59:00.07]Emerald gemstones tend to contain extraneous matter.
[59:04.63]Indeed, the source of a stone
[59:06.41]can sometimes be pinpointed by examining its impurities or inclusions.
[59:12.67]Interesting.
[59:18.29]Oh, Sapphire, that's mine!
[59:22.60]Guys, when I turned the page, I was just so just drawn to this side of the page.
[59:29.22]My goodness.
[59:30.49]I knew that was calling for me.
[59:39.35]Okay.
[59:41.28]Uh, what about this?
[59:45.62]Gold.
[59:47.68]Gold!
[59:49.28]Which one's gold?
[59:50.01]What would you consider gold?
[59:50.78]This one or this one?
[60:04.09]Yellow would be gold.
[60:13.27]No, spin it.
[60:19.01]No, this would be gold, right?
[60:30.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[60:32.05]It's probably the amount of times I have to spin it.
[60:34.91]47.
[60:35.11]Oh, AG is silver.
[60:38.05]What is gold?
[60:38.83]AU is gold, right?
[60:41.50]Yeah.
[60:42.41]Okay, AG is silver.
[60:43.72]Whoops, I fucked up.
[60:44.75]There's no silver on here.
[60:53.35]Dude, that's Australian.
[60:58.65]Okay, so silver.
[60:59.49]What does it want me to do with silver, though?
[61:11.64]47, does that matter?
[61:13.13]Why would it be showing the number in a different weird font?
[61:20.96]I'm not going to spin it 47 times.
[61:36.50]That's not it.
[61:37.61]Okay, so we gotta have the color code here, right?
[61:43.44]There's gonna be a color code.
[61:47.33]Camille with Hager Anderson and Chantilly Hildegard.
[61:53.38]Okay.
[61:54.56]So what?
[62:00.18]Alright, what do we got?
[62:01.34]Amethyst, does it say...
[62:03.77]So silver would be 47.
[62:05.64]Okay, how many colors do we have?
[62:17.57]Green.
[62:27.73]Put this down.
[62:28.35]Let me look at this box again.
[62:34.92]Alright, there's six colors.
[62:37.23]47 is the number for silver.
[62:39.82]Is it... the... hold on.
[62:46.21]Give me that book.
[62:58.77]How big is the book?
[63:04.40]Okay, that's the whole book.
[63:07.27]Alright, so 47.
[63:09.16]This would be page 1, 2, 3, 4, which is diamond.
[63:14.51]Right?
[63:15.15]And then 5, 6, 7 would be barrel and aquamarine.
[63:30.91]I don't know.
[63:35.93]What else?
[63:36.36]There's probably something else in the room.
[63:40.89]You're reading the back of the DVD cover?
[63:46.59]Yeah, there's more shit in here.
[63:47.42]Hold on.
[63:48.95]What is this?
[63:49.48]J H for Jake Hurley obviously.
[63:52.79]Okay.
[63:53.21]Must be Jake's insignia.
[63:55.04]Do I keep this?
[64:03.06]Right?
[64:04.50]Eliza Sandberger.
[64:08.16]Received of Jake Hurley for the price of $3.73.
[64:12.72]One Krollmeister doll.
[64:16.80]with decorative red ribbon.
[64:20.41]On this 16th day of June, 1880,
[64:26.92]Just...
[64:27.97]I don't know, man.
[64:28.69]I'm probably gonna... What do you mean?
[64:30.16]The camera's full!
[64:39.88]You can only have 10 pictures on this phone?
[64:42.14]What is this, like 10 kilobytes?
[64:49.03]Oh my god.
[64:50.03]Whatever.
[64:53.58]I'll...
[64:53.96]I don't... Somebody just go to the Vaude and take a screenshot of this.
[65:00.89]Wait.
[65:02.96]No.
[65:06.90]Okay.
[65:08.76]Hot dog.
[65:10.39]Wait.
[65:12.60]Okay, this one is... What is that one?
[65:17.58]Are the gems just all around his room?
[65:20.29]What's that one?
[65:25.26]Tiger's eye.
[65:28.03]Yellow.
[65:30.04]Fibrous type of crystalline.
[65:31.81]quartz in which thin yellowish and reddish brown bands are apparent when light reflects.
[65:37.39]Alright, so that's a tiger's eye.
[65:40.90]I gotta get a photo of that.
[65:42.05]I actually do.
[65:45.29]Whatever.
[65:48.04]Nice.
[65:48.52]Alright.
[65:48.92]So we got Tiger's Eye and World.
[65:53.50]Tiger's Eye and World.
[65:58.69]An old scale.
[66:02.59]Strange.
[66:03.75]It seems to be built into the wall.
[66:08.83]Duck.
[66:12.86]Okay.
[66:14.47]Ah, these are weights.
[66:15.72]Alright, so...
[66:17.95]Duck is...
[66:22.63]Wait, what the hell do you want me to do?
[66:33.84]Okay, so this weighs one owl.
[66:38.22]I can't look at my phone.
[66:41.45]Owl was what, seven?
[66:45.85]So this is plus three, minus three, but it's on the seven symbol, right?
[66:54.21]Seven and ten.
[66:57.56]Okay, this is gonna be a fucking monster pain in the ass.
[67:00.83]I'm so glad I did Junior Detective.
[67:07.35]Can I move it?
[67:11.60]Okay, I don't think I can move this.
[67:19.72]Unless there's a different way to move it, I cannot.
[67:26.92]Okay, well, I'll come back.
[67:35.62]Can I not keep going?
[67:37.04]Okay.
[67:38.15]Oh, shit.
[67:39.33]It wants it to put monster and cherry.
[67:42.66]That was seven and ten.
[67:45.83]So to get this to open, I gotta get this to be 710?
[67:48.91]I don't think I have enough stuff.
[67:58.47]Yeah, it's gotta be this and there's another indicator over there.
[68:01.59]Alright, I can't do it.
[68:03.99]I'll be back.
[68:14.18]Alright, I did that.
[68:15.25]What do I have for tools?
[68:17.93]I got a pencil?
[68:28.45]There's that poem right there.
[68:33.08]We're talking about dolls.
[68:36.01]I did that.
[68:38.00]There is in here... That is definitely something.
[68:42.46]That is a... not an emerald.
[68:44.07]What is that?
[68:45.59]I gotta remember the gem book for that one.
[68:53.31]Okay, it's you.
[68:54.11]Is this you?
[68:55.14]Is this you?
[68:57.54]Is this you?
[69:02.02]Jake reportedly told people that after she died, he would sometimes see strange glowing lights outside the windows at night, bobbing gracefully alongside the train
[69:11.65]Okay.
[69:13.00]Okay.
[69:24.82]Got anything behind you or anything?
[69:26.36]Yes.
[69:28.95]uh what are you actually what are you doing I'm writing my next book I'm on a deadline so until I write those two most wonderful of all three letter words the end
[69:38.87]Everywhere I go, my laptop goes and every chance I get, I write.
[69:46.45]This is where you grab the laptop.
[69:48.54]Just snag it.
[69:50.16]Open up one of the train windows, hold it out the window and say, where is she?
[69:52.57]Where is she?
[69:52.97]Where is she?
[69:53.38]Where is she?
[69:53.80]Three, two, one.
[69:56.29]And if she goes, oh my god, she's in the broom closet!
[69:58.58]It's like, I got it.
[69:59.40]Done.
[70:01.35]I'm just bluffing, by the way.
[70:06.55]Because if she goes, I don't know, I swear, I don't know, I don't know.
[70:09.44]When I get to one, zero, and she goes, no, I don't know.
[70:12.90]Then, oh, alright, fine, have it back.
[70:15.93]Okay.
[70:23.37]She brings a cloud back up.
[70:26.92]Not in 1995, man.
[70:32.42]Okay, what do you know about Jake Hurley?
[70:42.42]What else do you know about Jake Hurley?
[70:44.57]You know, the man who originally owned this train?
[70:46.90]Wealthy, imaginative, adventurous, stubborn, egocentric, and most importantly...
[70:52.41]He was smitten at the age of 35 by a young French woman named Camille Boullée, who died about a year after they were married.
[71:00.36]Why does he have a train?
[71:02.01]When did he buy this train?
[71:03.78]Sometime in the 1870s he decided to seek his fortune out west.
[71:07.63]So we had this train custom-built so that he and some years later his wife could traverse the mountains and plains in relative comfort
[71:15.84]Okay, so he went, what is it, Gold Rush?
[71:19.45]So he went west and became a miner?
[71:21.89]All anyone knows for sure is that years after Camille's death,
[71:25.18]He showed up in Denver with a pouch full of gold nuggets and semi-precious stones, which he used to purchase mining supplies.
[71:32.86]He refused to say how he'd come by them, which of course led to speculation that he had found a fantastically rich vein somewhere.
[71:40.39]Although to this day,
[71:41.47]Its existence remains unsubstantiated and its location quite unknown.
[71:47.53]What an un-fucking-believably strange time period.
[71:52.13]imagine if somebody told you hey we don't really know a whole lot about what's going on out west over here but we know that there's magical
[72:01.04]gems in the ground.
[72:02.67]And if you just go out there and dig, and you might find a shitload of it.
[72:11.47]Like, imagine if that was a thing.
[72:12.72]Imagine people just like, yep, well, you know, me and the missus, we're
[72:16.47]We're going to go over out to California and just bring a bunch of digging supplies.
[72:19.82]We're just going to dig in the ground until we find what is equivalent to about $40 million worth of gold.
[72:25.58]By the way, everybody, all of our neighbors are doing this too.
[72:28.57]Everybody that I know, everybody in the town is doing this.
[72:31.24]Most of us are doing this.
[72:34.22]Just going out with, like, digging supplies and trying to go find gold?
[72:44.46]You want to be the guy selling the shovels?
[72:47.74]Yeah.
[72:50.03]But still, it's kind of like I can't imagine that concept.
[72:55.03]I'm just like, if we dig for long enough, if we spend a few months out there and we just dig in the ground, what if we just... Oh, I just found like a slab of gold.
[73:05.89]Okay.
[73:06.73]Well, that was worth it.
[73:15.75]That's just Minecraft?
[73:24.28]You want to be Amish again?
[73:27.70]Today it'd be podcast, guys.
[73:30.85]Yeah, I was gonna say, today is like the equivalent of that is just...
[73:34.30]I don't know, like the YouTube algorithm?
[73:37.67]The TikTok algorithm?
[73:45.11]Historically accurate Minecraft.
[73:54.60]And what if you find it?
[73:55.67]That's the scariest part about it.
[74:00.23]Like back then, if it was like, oh, we've, and we're going out to the American frontier, me and my two boys and my wife, da-da-da-da.
[74:10.02]And we're going to be digging for gold and find our way with an adventure.
[74:15.20]But okay, so you do it and oh, Sean, what'd you find?
[74:19.20]Dad, you didn't understand what I found.
[74:21.01]Dad, I hid something.
[74:22.17]Sean, oh, let me take a look at that.
[74:24.14]Oh, watch out, Bessie!
[74:26.57]What is it?
[74:28.18]Look, it's gold!
[74:29.17]Dad, it's gold!
[74:30.81]Oh, we did it!
[74:31.90]Shut the fuck up, don't talk!
[74:34.79]Don't look around and cheat, everybody cover your fucking heads and get in the fucking wagon right now.
[74:41.25]You're just dead.
[74:42.88]There are 25 people probably in earshot of you that are going to kill you and your whole family for that.
[74:52.76]Like, what do you...
[74:54.19]Okay, you load it up in the wagon, and all of a sudden it's like three bandits right up next to you, like, hey, uh...
[75:00.39]We just wanted to... We saw you...
[75:02.36]The back of your wagon was fucking glistening.
[75:05.22]Yeah, it caught my eye.
[75:06.06]It hit my eye.
[75:07.70]It was really bright.
[75:09.15]You mind if we take a look back there?
[75:12.24]And that's spit.
[75:13.20]You know what I mean?
[75:13.70]Like, oh, well, gentlemen, I will tell you that we're just two.
[75:17.80]We're just traveling through.
[75:19.30]We heard that there was gold in this area.
[75:20.74]We want to come take a few pictures.
[75:23.80]Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
[75:25.98]All your gold is gone.
[75:32.86]It would happen exactly like this.
[75:35.05]Guys, you know, I've played Red Dead Redemption 2 before.
[75:39.02]This shit's terrifying.
[75:40.37]It's like carrying around a backpack.
[75:44.47]with just $5 million in it, in cash, just walking around.
[75:48.43]It's just like, oh, this is rocks.
[75:54.63]What would you do?
[76:01.09]You stab the guy who finds the gold.
[76:02.62]That's what I'm saying.
[76:03.36]That's why it's so dangerous, so horrible.
[76:09.49]Okay, if you hit gold and there's a bunch of people that hear about it, like, oh, you know, like...
[76:14.88]And now Joey hit gold.
[76:17.13]Ah, yeah, we just heard about it.
[76:18.90]People are talking about it now at the saloon.
[76:21.47]Do you just... Everybody...
[76:23.62]Do you just say, hey, everybody, I'll give you gold if you protect me?
[76:26.95]No, it's like, I'm just going to take it from you.
[76:32.26]Hey, -2, play the game.
[76:33.68]Time that person off for 4,000 hours.
[76:37.34]Gold Rush was just an extraction shooter.
[76:39.79]Honestly, you've got a fucking game there, man.
[76:43.95]You have a video game.
[76:45.95]If you want to make a game,
[76:47.75]Make a new extraction shooter where it's just you've got to go find the gold and everybody's got a pickaxe and a musket and shit.
[76:55.61]That would be sick.
[77:02.62]Oh wait, I can go back there.
[77:08.25]Cowboy extraction shooter.
[77:10.24]That is a genre that is just never...
[77:13.35]I'm just gonna repeat till I'm literally blue in the face, as they say, right?
[77:19.54]Can we just have... Ooh!
[77:22.55]Can we have like more cowboy stuff?
[77:26.63]I feel like we just get so many like hit marker Call of Duty type games.
[77:30.95]just let's get some more of like single like six shot revolvers do not open unless all pipes are connected okay well how do I connect them
[77:45.11]This is a death screen for sure.
[77:56.72]Uh-oh, that doesn't look good.
[78:01.79]Oh, my God!
[78:05.02]Engineer.
[78:07.56]Is this Mr. R?
[78:10.47]Huh?
[78:11.42]Uh, yes, this is her.
[78:12.58]Uh, yeah, this is Lori.
[78:14.80]Nice try.
[78:21.91]Okay, well, how do I open them?
[78:31.68]I can't seem to get over there.
[78:32.89]Can't go outside until the train stops.
[78:40.46]It should be like this, right?
[78:46.03]Hmm.
[78:50.90]You Living in the Cowboy Times would get you into a Looney Tunes conundrum where you accidentally end up kissing the horse or something when you were going to kiss a girl.
[79:01.84]Okay.
[79:09.03]An eagle?
[79:10.54]Where else have I seen an eagle?
[79:12.31]Wait, what do you mean an eagle?
[79:13.18]You've seen an eagle somewhere else?
[79:19.09]Was the eagle on that sheet?
[79:31.12]The puzzle had an eagle?
[79:33.89]You'd be the town oaf.
[79:36.28]Good!
[79:36.54]I don't care!
[79:37.53]Are you kidding me?
[79:39.69]You know, Jerma, you'd be the town oaf.
[79:43.37]You see, what would happen if I was...
[79:45.38]You don't want to be the guy that gets fucking killed over gold?
[79:48.51]You want to be the town oaf that is just a goofy guy that people laugh at for a few minutes?
[79:53.53]And nobody takes seriously, so nobody attacks you.
[79:57.22]Oh, wow, that's horrible, dude.
[80:00.01]Yeah, go get yourself in a bar fight and go, like, into a saloon and have the guy throw a beer at you and then beat the shit out of you and then maybe even, like, fucking get killed.
[80:11.48]I'm fine being the town oaf.
[80:13.47]That's perfect for me.
[80:16.19]Uh, okay.
[80:16.73]I need the...
[80:21.15]I need, even if I saw an Eagle, why would it even matter?
[80:30.77]Let me look at her notebook.
[80:32.84]See?
[80:33.12]If and how those symbols on the stove are related to those symbols on the sampler in Camille's car.
[80:39.99]The scale.
[80:40.83]Can't check that off yet.
[80:42.72]Figured out why a square and a duck are on a stove, and if they have anything to do with opening it.
[80:47.12]Still have to do that.
[80:52.84]Okay, so it, this, but I can't even interact with the scale.
[81:00.11]There's no way to put like a number in here.
[81:12.77]Do you have to like put the right weight on the thing over there and this will open?
[81:20.57]Do I have to put the duck weight on here and then this opens?
[81:26.61]I don't even know how to do it.
[81:30.88]There was a four-digit code.
[81:32.17]Yeah, wait, where the fuck was that digit code?
[81:33.88]It was in one of those vents.
[81:38.64]Where was that vent?
[81:39.97]It did have a code on it.
[81:41.17]The hell was it?
[81:45.86]What have you got?
[81:47.42]But the code was... had like weird symbols on it.
[82:06.92]Have I seen those symbols?
[82:13.42]Yeah, here's the, so what?
[82:15.84]Like, have I even seen these?
[82:36.03]Oh.
[82:38.20]Seven.
[82:39.69]The little book of samplers.
[82:43.91]OK, hold on.
[82:44.83]There's gonna be some info in here.
[82:50.65]Oh, God.
[82:52.45]Duck, marital fidelity.
[82:55.08]Eagle, America.
[82:56.21]Okay, eagle means America.
[82:57.95]So I got to put the globe to America.
[83:12.55]absolute ass.
[83:14.30]Can you stand back, by the way?
[83:17.44]Why do I have to take a- I want to take a photo with this book.
[83:19.74]I don't want to take a photo this fucking close.
[83:29.02]Okay, I got it.
[83:30.07]Let me go to the weight.
[83:33.96]Alright, let's go to the scale.
[83:40.26]Because now I can actually put some weight on this.
[83:44.73]That's where that guy is.
[83:45.50]Alright, here's the scale.
[83:48.19]Alright, so this wants me to be, it wants to be Cherry Owl.
[83:53.96]Alright, Cherry.
[83:59.18]Owl.
[84:01.89]Cherry.
[84:11.19]Okay, you need set, you need...
[84:13.46]Okay.
[84:16.25]Minus 10 is cherry.
[84:20.78]What about both over here?
[84:22.71]Plus 10 is also cherry.
[84:31.54]So this plus four is owl, and then...
[84:40.31]I think I have to do this in a row.
[84:43.02]Boom.
[84:44.42]Alright, so we got duck.
[84:48.32]Now it's... We need one.
[84:55.18]I can't make one from here, can I?
[84:57.86]No.
[84:58.37]I need more, uh...
[84:59.50]I need more units.
[85:14.46]Those look like steam pipes.
[85:16.27]OK, I gotta connect this, right?
[85:18.61]Weird puzzle.
[85:23.65]I can't do this yet.
[85:30.72]Oh shit.
[85:35.26]What in the Willy Wonka fuck is this?
[85:43.18]Is this a train?
[85:44.17]Did they put these in trains?
[85:46.43]What is this?
[85:54.97]Okay.
[86:02.16]Dude, I'm so glad I did Junior Detective.
[86:04.27]Okay.
[86:13.30]Oh, goodness.
[86:14.61]Uh...
[86:22.97]What was the person's name?
[86:29.65]Hurley or something, right?
[86:31.64]H-U-R-L-E-E-E-Y
[86:37.18]The other one was Camille.
[86:38.59]C-A-M-I-L-L-E. Fuck.
[86:50.54]This is a goofy-ass room!
[86:57.01]Okay, that one works.
[87:13.14]Oh, I forgot the whole thing.
[87:14.69]Oh, fuck.
[87:17.09]I thought I had it.
[87:17.71]What was it?
[87:24.44]It's pump pump pump pump pump.
[87:43.46]Get out of here!
[87:49.17]Lori?
[87:50.14]Hey!
[87:51.86]I solved it
[87:55.97]Where's Drew?
[88:00.98]Heroes way by ghosts or anything that bookshelf in the dining car you step on this thing in the floor in there and it slides open I practice disappearing for weeks and
[88:10.97]Lori, not only have all of us been incredibly, incredibly worried about you,
[88:23.44]We ate the detective.
[88:26.95]What are you thinking?
[88:31.34]Why would you do this?
[88:33.75]So it was just all for show?
[88:35.72]Well, not entirely.
[88:38.13]See, here's the deal.
[88:39.41]My dad wound up with this train when he bought out Noram Shipping.
[88:42.73]They've been storing it in this old warehouse outside St. Louis for so long that everybody had just forgotten about it.
[88:49.29]Because why did you do that?
[88:50.46]After, like, mass begging on my part, Dad had the train restored to working condition and got me an engineer and track permits and all that other stuff.
[88:59.16]until finally here we are.
[89:01.47]Great.
[89:01.81]On our way to find out what happened to Jake Hurley.
[89:04.51]Excellent.
[89:05.41]What are you doing?
[89:06.62]Uh, I think you were going to explain why you kidnapped yourself.
[89:10.79]Oh, right.
[89:11.90]Well, see, I was one of the first people in like a hundred years to set foot on this train, okay?
[89:17.25]Everything was just the way it was when Jake disappeared.
[89:20.71]Except, I also found this.
[89:24.43]It's a letter that Jake wrote in 1901 to his niece back east.
[89:29.45]He was real paranoid about claim jumpers, which is why he never told anyone where his mine was.
[89:34.96]But he was also afraid something would happen to him and no one would ever know where it was.
[89:40.33]So he wrote this letter to his only living relative, Ruth Kensington.
[89:44.95]Why did you kidnap yourself?
[89:49.86]Because you found me!
[89:51.42]See, in that letter, Jake tells Ruth that everything she needs to figure out where his mind is, is on this train!
[89:57.96]He also warns her that his wife's spirit is on the train too, which kind of creeps me out.
[90:03.71]You could've told us this at the table.
[90:13.55]letter in the wastebasket it was like she'd gotten so ticked off trying to follow her naughty uncle's clues that she finally said to heck with the whole thing
[90:23.32]Okay.
[90:24.52]Why are there other people here then?
[90:26.47]What about the other people you invited on this trip?
[90:29.26]If you want to show them that letter, go ahead.
[90:31.17]It's totally up to you.
[90:32.40]We're going to Copper Gorge because that's where Jake buried Camille, so I figured his mine might be somewhere around there too.
[90:38.84]Okay.
[90:46.79]How well do you know your guests?
[90:48.82]Well, I don't know you or those Harvey guys at all.
[90:51.88]Hardy.
[90:52.71]Frank and Joe Hardy.
[90:54.23]Whatever.
[90:54.88]I didn't know John Gray before this either, but I love his show.
[90:59.58]And I figured he'd jump at the chance to investigate an honest-to-goodness haunted train.
[91:04.38]And now that someone has finally found me, I can finally go meet him for real.
[91:11.56]This is where I request that they stop at the next stop.
[91:16.02]And I just go, good luck.
[91:18.55]Uh, don't ever waste my fucking time ever again.
[91:20.68]By the way, my fee is $5,000 an hour.
[91:24.27]Um, I'll be invoicing you.
[91:25.59]I've been here for about two hours.
[91:27.74]Lori.
[91:29.25]Thanks for wasting my fucking time.
[91:32.81]What about Tino Balducci?
[91:34.72]I met Tino right after he got famous for solving those robberies.
[91:38.31]Inviting him here for this was a no-brainer.
[91:40.78]I mean, what an awesome detective.
[91:42.73]You threw that lady's laptop out the window?
[91:47.18]No, I theoretically did.
[91:50.07]I theoretically threw an old lady's laptop out the window.
[91:53.09]Don't get that wrong.
[91:55.20]Do not get that the other way.
[91:57.61]Okay, hold on.
[92:01.50]Okay, what a cool detective.
[92:03.00]Okay, his mind's going 90 miles an hour.
[92:09.46]Alright.
[92:09.78]Well, that's too bad because we ate him.
[92:11.20]Yeah.
[92:12.96]How come you didn't try to find the mine yourself?
[92:15.84]Maybe I did.
[92:16.71]Or maybe I just thought letting other people try to find it would be a good excuse to throw a party.
[92:22.10]Alright, well fuck off.
[92:25.89]Do you have any more weights?
[92:35.06]Alright, so, hey, Laurie, we have... We have the opportunity to do the funniest thing in the world.
[92:41.85]I could just pretend I didn't find you, and then we need to sneak you back into one of the cars, and we need you to pretend to be a ghost.
[92:51.94]You need to show up, go peek your head out and scream, and then I'll talk.
[92:55.25]I'll say, oh my God, I saw a specter fly by.
[92:57.14]We could fuck with a guy here very, very specifically.
[93:02.21]OK. Am I doing a dance move?
[93:19.97]Okay, obviously you need to know the move, which I don't have.
[93:35.53]OK, well, I'll get this later.
[93:40.88]What else you got?
[93:45.43]Ooh.
[93:46.72]What grate?
[94:00.01]Oh my goodness.
[94:01.51]Is this a find the word?
[94:08.87]Uh... Sur... Su...
[94:16.53]Duh-ver.
[94:19.26]Silver.
[94:25.58]Silver.
[94:31.84]Si...
[94:34.91]Wait, can I just do... No, I have to go in a row.
[94:37.28]You can't do diagonal either.
[94:43.76]Let's see...
[95:02.36]Acid!
[95:09.01]Somebody said that in chat.
[95:10.86]I'm sorry, I cheated.
[95:18.18]Indian... Dessert... Mmm... Lat... At... Attic!
[95:30.17]Attic.
[95:32.00]Attic acid.
[95:34.94]Acid to get into the attic.
[95:38.11]Attic acid.
[95:46.42]Wait, you can do this way.
[95:48.26]You can't go, okay, you can't go diagonal, but you can go that way.
[95:50.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[95:58.10]That changes everything.
[96:01.48]The 3rd of November, 1901 from somewhere in Colorado.
[96:05.89]Dear Ruth,
[96:06.66]I know that we've never met, but now that your father, my estranged brother, is gone, you are my only living relative.
[96:13.96]I am writing to you to tell you about my mind before I too depart this Earth and its location is lost forever.
[96:21.46]I cannot tell you outright where it is, lest this epistle fall into the wrong hands.
[96:26.39]But with the information which follows and with my train, it shall be yours upon my death.
[96:31.43]I promise that you'll be able to find it First, you will need a map To obtain it, know that my travels have taken me all over this great country
[96:40.51]Silverado.
[96:46.36]Silverado.
[96:47.13]To Dodge City, Virginia City, and Tombstone.
[96:50.28]To locate the mine on the map, you'll need my projector.
[96:53.45]Stone.
[96:59.26]I have stored his name accordingly, but to retrieve his name you'll have to give the dolls an order.
[97:05.42]Oh god.
[97:06.28]Alright, too many steps.
[97:15.39]Okay, give Camille's dancing shoes the name of their maker.
[97:24.77]But alas, she's taken them with her to her grave.
[97:28.09]So go to Copper Gorge, Colorado and pay your respects, and let some of her goodness rub off on you.
[97:33.95]Okay, alright.
[97:35.58]Alright, alright!
[97:38.61]Too much!
[97:39.03]We need one paragraph at a time!
[97:42.32]People say I'm crazy, but I've seen her, and heard her, and feel her presence on the train even today, 20 years after her untimely death.
[97:52.23]So above all else, my dear niece, let nothing happen to my train.
[97:57.37]There's gold in the floorboards or something fucked up.
[98:07.63]Alright, Syl.
[98:19.45]First you need a map.
[98:21.74]To obtain it, know that my travels have taken me all over this great country.
[98:26.97]to towns which can be difficult calico silverado and central city to dodge okay what about calico is there a calico here
[98:42.77]Cali... Oh, fuck off.
[98:57.47]Cali... Ooh!
[99:00.54]Calico.
[99:03.73]Well, that's the loudest fucking sound I've ever heard in my life.
[99:12.92]Don't know why that was that loud.
[99:16.26]Okay, Silverado.
[99:19.51]Silverado.
[99:25.36]Central City.
[99:34.49]is next.
[99:35.64]We have to do it in order.
[99:36.55]We have to do it in a row.
[99:38.20]Central city.
[99:41.75]C E N T R O L C E N...
[99:50.86]Shit, Sen Central City
[100:01.98]Okay.
[100:03.97]Then we're going to Dodge City.
[100:09.00]Virginia City Tombstone.
[100:11.76]Dodge City?
[100:19.19]Virginia City.
[100:28.90]Tombstone.
[100:36.80]Got it.
[100:37.68]GG.
[100:39.56]That was cool.
[100:40.49]That was a fun one.
[100:40.98]I liked that one a lot.
[100:46.88]So that now, this goes into that other thing that I need to put in.
[100:55.40]Actually, I need to take a picture of this.
[101:12.75]Got it.
[101:15.79]Good job, Drew Crew.
[101:17.07]I gotta check some of these off.
[101:24.41]My quest log is crazy right now.
[101:34.35]Keep your eyes peeled for more slugs.
[101:38.07]See even how those symbols work.
[101:40.35]Figure out why a square and a duck mean.
[101:43.18]Something tells me the scale that's built into that wall has got some other shit happening.
[101:48.06]Yep.
[101:48.38]What about that old cigar box?
[101:52.14]Must have something to do with the letters A-G, but how?
[101:54.61]Okay.
[101:57.10]Strange looking bolts.
[101:58.04]That's the one I have, right?
[102:01.86]Go to the piano and see what happens when I play the tune.
[102:07.28]Okay.
[102:09.50]Open the lock in the sleeping car.
[102:11.99]Dial in four numbers.
[102:12.94]Figured out which...
[102:14.54]Wait, figure out which four numbers...
[102:16.71]Still have to do that.
[102:19.21]What's going on with those colored blocks?
[102:21.44]Wait, I did that?
[102:25.17]Oh.
[102:26.90]That was the flower.
[102:30.51]Don't know how to do that.
[102:34.77]Did that.
[102:36.52]Talk to Tino and see what he picked up.
[102:38.40]Got it.
[102:39.69]Found her.
[102:40.29]Finish that.
[102:43.78]Uh...
[102:45.61]When task has been completed, remember to check it off.
[102:47.61]Okay, so I called Bess.
[102:50.63]Alright, we're good to go.
[102:53.02]I'm going to take this and I'm going to go to the place where I can pull that off.
[103:01.73]What?
[103:02.54]So this is a projector.
[103:14.19]Alright, well I don't give a shit about any of this right now.
[103:24.63]Alright, so where was that car?
[103:30.20]Not this one, right?
[103:34.86]Oh, eat shit.
[103:39.78]Hold on.
[103:42.45]Always work backwards.
[103:52.95]They probably all have to be connected.
[103:54.20]Maybe not?
[104:10.90]Let me get a good visual, hold on
[104:37.65]I always hate these because do they all have to be connected?
[105:12.56]Shit.
[105:20.12]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[105:42.38]So I said, I solved this mentally in a nanosecond.
[105:44.94]You ain't here sitting in the chair with a mouse in your hand.
[105:47.41]Alright, settle down.
[105:50.55]Yeah, every Dark Souls boss I've ever seen somebody beat, I go, oh, I just watched, I beat that in my head.
[106:06.56]Hold on.
[106:07.62]Close.
[106:26.16]There's no way, there's no- I just beat it!
[106:28.49]How- did it take me four minutes to do this?
[106:38.22]Dude, I can rotate a cube in my mind.
[106:40.35]Well, mine can be 3D and it could be...
[106:43.27]I can change it.
[106:44.36]Now it's a circle.
[106:45.98]Now it's an elephant.
[106:47.81]Now, I just saw a dog, a 3D dog, do a backflip with the cube in its mouth.
[106:55.45]And I just changed it from a 3D dog to a watercolor dog.
[107:03.43]And the dog, the dog just bit me.
[107:05.51]The dog just bit my hand.
[107:07.48]And my hand is a 3D hand in my head.
[107:10.54]The dog is still biting my hand.
[107:12.37]He won't let go.
[107:13.46]I cannot get him off my hand.
[107:16.28]He's biting.
[107:16.89]Hard.
[107:18.15]Okay, please.
[107:19.19]Where's the owner?
[107:20.06]Who owns this dog?
[107:21.06]I just made up the owner.
[107:22.30]The guy with the mustache walked in.
[107:23.45]Guy just was like, get down, down, down, down, down.
[107:26.58]The dog is still on my hand.
[107:27.86]He's still biting my fucking hand.
[107:29.53]I can see blood starting to come out of my hand.
[107:34.52]Boom, snap.
[107:35.44]I'm now sitting in a river.
[107:37.05]I'm in a boat in a river and I'm rowing and I have one of those like Gorton's Fisherman's costumes on.
[107:43.19]Please move along.
[107:47.54]What did that even do?
[107:52.63]Can I can actually turn the pipe down?
[108:04.52]Oh yeah, well, I imagined that you imagined all that.
[108:08.16]Alright, that's funny.
[108:19.57]Ooh, more letters.
[108:22.95]It's kind of a... that doll.
[108:25.26]I accidentally knocked...
[108:29.38]Tina off the shelf and literally, I'm afraid, fractured his tiny skull.
[108:34.20]What the fuck?
[108:35.43]Apologies.
[108:37.78]crack which now traverses Naughty Tina's face.
[108:43.72]I hold her.
[108:44.49]I'd order another as soon as I reach.
[108:46.12]Okay.
[108:46.44]It's time I'm breaking a doll.
[108:48.15]You broke a doll.
[108:54.81]Silver is orange.
[108:58.61]Blue, green, red...
[109:02.86]Okay.
[109:04.44]So it's orange, blue, green, red, purple, yellow.

[110:19.86]orange, red, green, blue, purple, yellow,
[110:30.35]Ding!
[110:33.21]Huh?

[110:49.39]What happened?
[110:55.14]Orange, blue, wait, orange, red, bleem, bleem, grue.
[111:00.74]Oh, grue.
[111:02.67]Oh, yes, the minions.
[111:05.45]It's orange, red, green, but it grew.
[111:07.55]Okay, how do I, what is it?
[111:09.56]Orange.
[111:14.26]You swapped colors?
[111:15.53]Orange, blue, red, green, purple, yellow.
[111:19.04]Orange... Orange?
[111:25.16]Blue, red, orange, blue, red, green, purple, yellow.
[111:39.52]What?
[111:41.17]Orange green... People are just writing random shit here.
[111:45.60]Orange...
[111:49.18]Orange, blue, green... Orange, blue, green, red, purple, yellow.
[111:53.17]Orange, blue, green, red...

[111:59.07]Orange, blue, green, red.
[112:05.98]purple, yellow.
[112:14.35]Nothing in here besides the dance studio.
[112:18.03]Oh my god.
[112:20.65]Okay, this is a one, two, okay.
[112:25.15]Okay.
[112:28.29]Oh, I have an idea.
[112:29.30]Why don't I take a really close-ass fucking picture of it?
[112:34.12]Yeah, let me see.
[112:36.02]Oh, let me... Oh, yeah, that's a great fucking photo.
[112:41.25]Can I get a mental screenshot of this, please?
[112:44.49]Wilson carbide and acetylene works.
[112:51.55]Dear Jake, I've sent you two lamps which you should have received by the end of the month.
[113:00.01]When you get them, simply place
[113:01.54]Thank you.
[113:02.55]carbide in the lower chamber, water in the upper chamber, then use the built-in Flint lighter to ignite the jet of gas which results.
[113:12.93]As you'll see, the carbide lamps is an exceedingly practical device, especially for people in your dark and dangerous line of work.
[113:23.63]Would that you or I had invented it?
[113:27.33]Dude, Curse of Iza is gone, by the way.
[113:29.78]I have heard...
[113:31.47]that actually like a lot of younger than Gen Z cannot even read cursive.
[113:35.61]Is that correct?
[113:43.61]It's for the best.
[113:46.44]But look at how elegant that is.
[113:48.45]Don't you want, I feel like it's, it's elegant.
[113:55.08]Okay, who cares about this?
[113:56.64]I got... Oh, wait, hold on.
[114:00.52]Well I...
[114:02.57]I should have read the rest of that.
[114:05.30]Alright, Thomas Wilson sent a letter.
[114:07.35]And I cannot prove to everybody that I cannot do three...
[114:10.48]I can only do one of three pages.
[114:11.76]That's outrageous.
[114:13.61]Alright.
[114:13.83]In your last letter, you sounded quite despondent.
[114:17.34]old chum.
[114:18.64]I suppose this is understandable in view of your failure to strike it rich.
[114:24.26]but I'm living proof of how quickly misfortune can turn into good fortune.
[114:28.80]Little did I suspect, five years ago, that my attempt to produce aluminum would instead produce calcium carbide.
[114:37.22]or that calcium carbide, when placed in water, will release acetylene.
[114:45.01]Yet suddenly, I was surprised.
[114:47.73]I was very surprised by this.
[114:48.98]But happy owner of the potent...
[114:51.60]for an expensive way of manipulating an extremely flammable gas.
[114:58.01]Just as I became wealthy when I sold that patent.
[115:02.14]I have no doubt that you too will someday be handsomely rewarded for your efforts.
[115:07.95]Continue to keep me appraised of your adventures, dear friend, and never, ever give up.
[115:14.29]May the lamps I sent you soon light your way to the gold you seek.
[115:22.51]The only thing I give a shit about is that we got the... We got this thing.
[115:34.61]What else did I get from that?
[115:41.53]Okay.
[115:42.39]Cool.
[115:43.58]Cool.
[115:45.52]Uh, I have that code I can put in.
[115:49.13]There's also this shit.
[116:02.62]Anything else in here I can do?
[116:04.35]Why do you think I came in here, Ancy?
[116:15.23]A little too antsy to get this fucking shit done.
[116:44.30]Fuck.
[117:06.83]fuck alright wait wait wait I gotta hold on I understand how it works now I gotta just do it I gotta set I get a big setup it's a big setup
[117:52.01]This one doesn't move anything.
[118:23.77]Fuck, I hate this shit.
[118:35.65]God damn it!
[118:37.64]These drive me insane, because you have to queue up everything and...
[118:41.54]Hold on.
[118:42.64]I'm ready to relax.
[118:52.74]Okay.
[118:53.89]Wait.
[118:54.85]So now...
[118:56.38]I think I got it.
[118:58.41]So I gotta do this one...
[119:04.47]this one goes boom that one oh I thought this one was going to turn that one I thought that was going to turn that one
[119:16.18]Hold on.
[119:17.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[119:25.92]Sorry.
[119:45.79]How do I get this one to turn again without turning that one?
[119:48.06]This one, right?
[119:57.98]No!
[120:05.02]Alright, settle down.
[120:05.94]Settle down.
[120:06.46]I got it.
[120:07.00]I just gotta...
[120:07.97]It's like two moves away.
[120:11.64]It's...
[120:11.98]This one...
[120:13.77]This one does...
[120:16.95]Hold on.
[120:17.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[120:19.04]A termite could do this.
[120:20.46]Termites can't use their mouths with a computer.
[120:22.41]And by the way, shut up, dick.
[120:42.70]It's this one little fucker right here.
[121:11.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, now it's this one?
[121:14.88]Wait, it's done, it's done, it's done.
[121:19.39]This one right?
[121:20.43]Top left?
[121:22.51]He's rage baiting.
[121:24.10]Why don't you one day open up a random ass fucking puzzle?
[121:27.84]And I have a stadium full of people screaming, hurry, hurry up.
[121:32.28]Hey, hey, did you say, have you fired it ever in your life?
[121:38.74]Oh, goddammit, it wasn't that one.
[121:55.60]I hate it.
[121:58.31]I hate it.
[121:58.77]I'm like, I'm so done with it.
[122:00.22]It's like, I'm so close.
[122:02.06]I'm so close.
[122:03.39]I think I just have to say, fuck that one.
[122:05.42]and just deal with the ones down here, right?
[122:12.87]Like, can I get...
[122:13.75]I just need a second!
[122:15.73]Wait, wait, wait.
[122:16.69]Okay, okay, okay.
[122:17.22]Wait, wait, wait.
[122:26.53]Alright, now...
[122:28.74]It's...
[122:29.52]If I turn this one, it's going to move that one.
[122:31.85]If I turn this one, it's going to move this one.
[122:33.96]But it won't move this one.
[122:35.51]This one has to be like a one full notch early.
[122:43.15]This one has to be like here.
[122:45.51]Then this one has to be one ahead of it.
[122:49.14]But then that fucks up this one.
[122:57.41]I'm so close to getting this stupid ass thing.
[123:08.95]God damn it!
[123:34.37]I'm so close, but like my- I'm just having so much trouble with like the- the delayed of like this one clicks the- hold on.
[123:41.77]You have to use the other pegs.
[123:42.79]These ones are all locked in though.
[123:52.88]Yeah, look at how fucked up.
[123:53.90]You just told me to click the other pegs.
[123:55.19]Are you crazy?
[123:55.87]Everything just got fucked up now.
[124:00.07]The solo pegs are the ones you do last.
[124:09.01]Wait, wait, come back, come back, come back.
[124:26.51]Viewers are dropping.
[124:27.66]You could all leave and I'm still going to be here.
[124:29.67]I don't care.
[125:07.90]Son of a bitch.
[125:09.31]I hate this shit.
[125:11.47]Okay, hold on.
[125:12.90]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[125:15.62]I'm gonna go wicked slow.
[125:17.00]I'm not gonna look at chat once.
[125:18.81]You can all shove it up your ass for all I care.
[125:21.70]Here we go.
[125:35.07]This doesn't move anything.
[125:39.86]Okay.
[125:40.88]This is the...
[125:44.74]Okay, these...
[125:45.63]This affects nothing.
[125:49.19]So this one can just be done whenever.
[125:52.37]This one is bottom right.
[125:54.13]This one is bottom right and middle bottom.
[126:01.42]Why is Irma never this mean in my funny YouTube shorts?
[126:12.23]you know how many times I've said to shove it up your ass to random people what are you talking about
[126:22.37]Alright, let me focus.
[126:24.99]I hate this.
[126:26.72]I hate this puzzle.
[126:29.28]What I would do is I would just- I would just grab a fucking crowbar and rip this thing off the- I would rip it off.
[126:35.18]And I would pay a hundred, I'd be like, who owns this?
[126:37.74]Here's 200 bucks to fix it.
[126:39.42]I don't give a fuck.
[126:40.09]This thing's coming off.
[126:43.42]I was so close, you guys got in my head.
[126:45.51]Alright, here we go.
[127:18.79]And they take less turns too, like some of them need more.
[127:24.07]Because look, these two are facing the right direction, and they're like, that has to be facing, like, down left.
[127:28.01]That sucks.
[127:29.32]Okay.
[127:29.94]It'd be great if they all had to go one direction or something.
[127:32.78]Alright, here we go.
[127:34.23]So this is to be further...
[127:38.19]This has to be two.
[127:39.23]Okay, that one's done.
[127:53.04]Oh, that's such absolute dog shit.
[127:55.64]This affects, they all affect the bottom right one.
[128:15.03]This one has to be another one further.
[128:19.44]OK, hold on so I'm getting there.
[128:22.63]I need this one to be.
[128:23.95]What needs to happen first?
[128:28.77]This one has to...
[128:30.17]I have to lock this one in with this one.
[128:32.68]That's the only way.
[128:35.25]So that's just be one more forward like this.
[128:37.41]Ready?
[128:58.75]I need to get this to the point where it's going to close.
[129:01.01]I think it's two more.
[129:02.82]Okay, so like that.
[129:07.34]These two are now synced up.
[129:09.93]That means that now...
[129:11.48]I just did it.
[129:15.09]I got it.
[129:15.46]I got it.
[129:15.94]I got it.
[129:16.28]I got it.
[129:16.72]I think I just got it.
[129:19.53]Oh!
[129:32.08]Get the fuck out of here.
[129:35.48]I want everybody in this chat to bow.
[129:37.69]I want you to bow to me.
[129:39.86]I want you to go down and I want you to put your hands out and I want you to be bowing to me.
[129:45.27]For how quickly and how well I did that puzzle.
[129:53.73]Okay, wait.
[129:57.63]You can get up.
[129:58.09]You can get up.
[129:58.98]You can get up.
[129:59.34]You're dismissed.
[130:00.38]You're dismissed.
[130:02.37]Hold on.
[130:02.63]I gotta do something else.
[130:11.69]Bro, what the fuck is this?
[130:21.59]This sucks.
[130:23.18]No, okay.
[130:23.66]Oh, okay.
[130:24.04]Blue does everything.
[130:26.49]Blue moves red too?
[130:30.91]What the fuck is this fried egg puzzle?
[130:34.69]What are you talking about?
[130:46.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[130:50.00]Bow, bow, bow.
[130:58.99]What did that do?
[131:08.07]What did that do?
[131:23.46]It's just fixed now?
[131:24.60]Okay.
[131:29.19]Don't I have a thing?
[131:36.23]That was just an optional puzzle.
[131:37.82]That would be really funny if it was.
[131:42.88]Alright, should I tell this guy that we found her?
[131:54.05]I think this is another great, which is terrifying to me.
[132:07.13]Right, this...
[132:08.10]I don't... What the hell is this?
[132:11.02]They put in like a date?
[132:14.23]Alright, connect the pipes in Camille's car that were under the grate.
[132:16.61]Got it.
[132:17.99]Figure out what to do with the dance step.
[132:20.14]Ah, we gotta go dance.
[132:21.87]Alright, let's go for it.
[132:25.41]Uh... John?
[132:29.57]John?
[132:35.97]John, I just saw a ghost.
[132:38.82]Monka Giga.
[132:39.95]Robert Downey Jr. is chasing after you behind you.
[132:57.77]Okay, let me do this now.
[133:00.88]Can I like touch this?
[133:06.72]I cannot.
[133:13.53]Can't turn that anymore.
[133:18.26]Let's dance.
[133:25.75]Okay.
[133:27.48]Alright.
[133:28.75]Let me see what I got.
[133:29.72]Let me take a look.
[133:34.69]Great.
[133:35.44]That's great.
[133:36.02]Good job.
[133:38.64]That's exactly what I was looking for.
[133:55.70]Okay, where's it?
[133:56.75]It's right here, isn't it?
[134:00.19]Okay, we got...
[134:02.76]Left one, right two.
[134:07.50]Where's three?
[134:10.31]One, two.
[134:13.07]Three, four, okay.
[134:17.13]Alright, hold on.
[134:23.45]1... 2... 3... 4?
[134:28.85]Like that?
[134:33.99]Oh I can't leave and look at the notebook.
[134:44.51]So you go one, one square up, two.
[134:48.04]I'm taking a picture with my phone.
[134:58.39]Shit's charged up now.
[134:59.54]Let's go.
[135:06.55]That's cheating.
[135:07.35]No, it is not cheating.
[135:11.19]Alright, here we go.
[135:12.06]I got it.
[135:17.23]Darn, the name of the shoes is so faded I can't tell what it is.
[135:21.29]Hmm, maybe Bess and George can help me figure out who made them.
[135:24.21]I need to call anybody for this I don't need to call anybody alright we're going up one
[135:31.42]two why this my iPhone camera sucks three
[135:42.10]Four.
[135:45.48]Five.
[135:46.10]Six.
[135:58.15]Next one.
[135:58.97]Eight.
[136:09.79]nine ten that's it that's it I did it right
[136:21.79]No, fuck off.
[136:22.99]I did it wrong.
[136:25.66]It's hard to see.
[136:26.43]I did the last part wrong.
[136:31.54]one two three
[136:41.57]Five.
[136:45.57]Six.
[136:53.14]Seven.
[136:57.32]Eight.
[137:02.09]9, 10, 8.
[137:13.60]Hmm.
[137:32.95]How sick would it have been if I just got it?
[137:36.66]Okay, that's definitely color coded.
[137:40.11]Probably by the pages of the book.
[137:41.20]Something fell on the ground, too.
[137:43.07]Nice.
[137:51.04]Wonder how you're supposed to get this open.
[137:54.72]Okay, so very obviously there's dolls.
[137:57.84]And these dolls... Do they have anything else besides this?
[138:01.06]Let's see.
[138:02.57]No?
[138:03.52]What about you?
[138:04.49]Alright, this one's eyes are closed.
[138:08.71]Hey, that one's sleepy?
[138:11.28]That one just said ma- I said that.
[138:13.25]That was weird.
[138:16.86]Red, maybe?
[138:21.49]Just making sure.
[138:25.27]Colored eyes, maybe?
[138:34.41]I don't think I have the info for this.
[138:49.46]Okay, that's fine.
[138:51.91]Uh, alright.
[138:52.73]Let me look in my checklist.
[138:57.85]Oh, right, the dancing shoes.
[138:59.36]Weren't they... there was another pair...
[139:02.45]Same company or something, right?
[139:06.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[139:06.70]Is there an item?
[139:10.63]No.
[139:12.04]Alright.
[139:12.27]There was the first car, I think.
[139:25.21]Mama.
[139:30.10]Mama.
[139:44.29]Okay, very cool, very cool.
[139:46.75]To save the game, it's been like two hours.
[139:55.11]Last time I saved the game, I think I died.
[139:57.43]And that was like the very beginning of the game.
[140:03.88]Hey, Nancy.
[140:04.83]What's with the Cheshire Cat grin?
[140:06.71]You found Lori.
[140:08.38]No.
[140:09.16]She's holed up in the caboose.
[140:10.68]And as a reward for finding her, she let me have this.
[140:13.45]it's a letter from Jake's niece in which he leaves clues telling her how to find his mind only the clues are extremely obtuse
[140:22.68]You found Lori.
[140:23.75]You got the letter with all the clues.
[140:25.98]Guess you don't need us anymore.
[140:27.30]Oh, Joe, quit pouting.
[140:28.97]Want any help?
[140:29.65]From the famous Hardy Boys?
[140:34.48]It stands to reason that the only person other than Jake who had to have known the location of Jake's mine was the engineer on Jake's train.
[140:41.67]It stands to reason that the only person other than Jake who had to have known the location of Jake's mine was the engineer on Jake's train.
[140:49.39]Very true.
[140:50.16]Not necessarily.
[140:51.77]Jake might not have told him the exact location.
[140:53.94]Maybe he just had him drop him off somewhere nearby.
[140:55.98]Well still, we'd be way ahead of the game if we knew where that drop-off point was.
[141:01.21]Hmm.
[141:01.95]If the engineer had any surviving relatives, we may be in luck.
[141:05.91]The guy died more than a hundred years ago.
[141:07.55]How are we supposed to find out his name?
[141:09.34]Maybe Charlena Whatserface could tell us how to go about it.
[141:12.25]Okay.
[141:12.57]Good idea, Frank.
[141:13.52]I'll ask her.
[141:15.79]See you in a bit.
[141:16.89]Sounds good.
[141:24.73]Can I just call the engineer?
[141:26.03]Wait, I can just tell the engineer, like, hey, I found Laurie.
[141:29.81]Engineer, this better be Miss Gerard.
[141:32.92]Well, actually...
[141:34.34]Forget it.
[141:36.27]OK, well.
[141:38.36]I can do this now.
[141:40.01]Because you'll be safe.
[141:44.16]Apparently not.
[141:51.82]The Hardy Boys have a game on PC.
[141:53.59]You should play it.
[141:56.99]Do you think it's any good?
[141:59.21]I mean, Nancy Drew games are unbeatable.
[142:08.89]Alright, this is going to pop off when the eagle wait is done.
[142:17.13]Alright, here we go.
[142:19.06]Alright.
[142:20.67]Sadie Crawford?
[142:22.48]So is that who made the other shoes?
[142:28.27]Sadie Crawford.
[142:30.21]Why is she not going, oh, look.
[142:34.94]Shouldn't she say, oh, you found it.
[142:37.75]Yes?
[142:38.83]I found Lori.
[142:39.77]She's in the caboose.
[142:40.94]You were right.
[142:41.94]She disappeared because she wanted to see which of us would find her first.
[142:45.71]And you won.
[142:47.20]Okay, how do we find out this dude's name?
[142:53.41]If you're smart, you'd ask me.
[142:55.44]And because my work is going surprisingly well, during my next break I'll log on to my archives at home and see what I can turn up.
[143:02.05]Well, let's go.
[143:04.14]Whoever invented the cellular modem, that's whom you should thank, dear.
[143:11.50]Okay, so... She said, yes, I can do that, but not now.
[143:16.08]Come back later.
[143:17.21]Okay.
[143:27.83]Alright, let me look at my checklist.
[143:30.38]I did this, right?
[143:31.37]No, I didn't do this one.
[143:34.70]Gotta be a way to get in there.
[143:37.25]It's not gonna date.
[143:45.89]Okay, well apparently it's not the same person.
[143:50.71]Okay.
[143:57.45]Did that.
[143:58.89]Figured out where the letters that were left at the bottom of that puzzle on the caboose are good for.
[144:02.65]Used that weird tool to open that grate.
[144:06.12]I did that.
[144:07.44]Keep your eyes peeled for more of those slugs.
[144:12.91]I don't know why a square and a duck exist.
[144:15.24]Okay.
[144:15.76]Had to open that old cigar box.
[144:17.79]Okay, did that.
[144:21.82]Alright, I gotta do the piano thing.
[144:27.11]Alright, hey, look.
[144:27.83]Can I get you out of this room so I can play your piano?
[144:30.73]I found a ghost.
[144:34.44]Huh?
[144:44.01]Charlina said Jake Hurley used to see them too, only he attributed them to his dead wife, Camille.
[144:49.83]They're probably some form of piezoelectricity.
[144:52.82]See, my guess is quartz crystals in the ground are being compressed as the train passes over them.
[144:57.96]and the resulting voltage, called piezoelectricity, is manifesting itself as glowing light.
[145:03.63]Probably because of some quirk in the train shape or in the composition of the metals used in its construction.
[145:09.00]It was custom-built, remember.
[145:11.35]It was scary though.
[145:12.19]Whatever it's called, it was unnerving to say the least.
[145:14.91]take it from me it was super scary you should check it out some pretty scary stuff
[145:22.72]I found Lori safe and sound in the caboose, so I guess those vibes you got about her being in serious trouble were wrong.
[145:29.40]Wait, he's saying I'm in danger?
[145:41.01]Me?
[145:41.89]I'm not in any trouble.
[145:43.44]Trust me, either you or Laurie is, or soon will be, in big trouble.
[145:49.20]No offense, but I don't believe you.
[145:51.82]Don't say I didn't warn you.
[145:53.05]Okay, well...
[145:54.21]Thanks for the chat.
[145:55.36]Come back anytime.
[145:56.48]How do I get you to leave?
[146:00.87]That's a pretty sick Half-Life heel sound.
[146:11.10]Okay, I gotta get one for the duck.
[146:12.99]I need more slugs.
[146:15.42]Can't open this thing.
[146:17.38]I got no key to open this.
[146:23.89]Come on, really?
[146:26.52]Okay, fine.
[146:28.97]Alright, well, uh... Did we talk to the detective?
[146:49.79]What is this?
[146:51.63]I feel like I can touch that.
[146:57.73]Well, it's the little lady detective.
[147:00.94]What do you need?
[147:02.00]I found Lori.
[147:02.94]She was hiding in the caboose.
[147:04.73]Oh yeah?
[147:06.77]She disappeared because she wanted to see who'd find her first, which is why she left that clue behind.
[147:14.96]That slug?
[147:16.64]I mean, I knew that slug was a clue.
[147:19.16]That's why I gave it to you.
[147:20.52]I mean, I could have found Lori no sweat, but I thought, hey...
[147:23.56]Why not give somebody else a shot?
[147:25.52]And you came through.
[147:26.81]Nice job.
[147:27.99]Thank you.
[147:29.16]You got any more of those?
[147:30.59]If you come across anything that may have something to do with Jake hurling his mind...
[147:34.38]Let me know, okay?
[147:35.97]Just so I can, you know, give you advice, help you sort things out.
[147:39.69]After all...
[147:40.45]The opportunity to work side by side with a world famous police detective doesn't come along every day, you know.
[147:46.99]Thanks for your help.
[147:48.01]This guy may as well have blood all over his hands at this point, you know what I mean?
[147:54.24]I'd be surprised if it was not this guy.
[148:02.49]yeah we saw this like at this point this guy his mouth is covered in chocolate
[148:12.03]And there are cookie crumbs all over his desk.
[148:16.02]And we are trying to solve the case of the cookie mystery.
[148:28.56]Um... Where should I go?
[148:33.01]Can't check that off yet.
[148:35.97]I did that.
[148:38.41]But the letters that were left at the bottom of that puzzle in the caboose are good for.
[148:43.60]Wait, wait, wait, let's, let's, hold on.
[148:47.16]I want his actual big letter.
[148:48.46]Here we go.
[148:49.33]Alright.
[148:50.01]First need a map.
[148:52.51]To locate the mine on the map, you'll need my projector.
[148:55.78]When it comes to placing the stones, you'll need to ask someone who holds a warm place in my heart.
[149:01.82]Okay, we gotta figure out this fucking guy's name.
[149:06.76]Give the dolls an order.
[149:09.62]This will require looking inside Camille's dancing shoes for the name of their maker and wearing the shoes as yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[149:23.27]Wait, wait.
[149:25.52]She has... Camille has four words for you.
[149:28.25]Words that when you translate into numbers and use in combination will power the projector.
[149:39.42]Oh wait, I can put that code in.
[149:40.69]Where was that code?
[149:44.00]Where was that big, long, weird code?
[149:46.35]What room was that in?
[149:53.87]Oh, hello.
[149:59.11]What?
[149:59.44]The question is, did somebody throw the brake?
[150:03.38]Or something?
[150:04.46]I think it was the ghost guy.
[150:13.53]Who was the next person on the scene?
[150:16.00]John Gray.
[150:17.00]Ben Balducci came bursting through one door while Frank and the engineer came through the other.
[150:21.40]Boy, was that guy ticked.
[150:22.91]He said the train could have derailed.
[150:24.88]He reset the brake, muttered a few choice words, then headed back to the engine just as you and Laurie showed up.
[150:29.84]Hmm.
[150:37.78]There's no way Lori could have thrown the brake unless she had someone else do it.
[150:42.23]The question is why?
[150:43.85]What did she or anybody else stand to gain by stopping the train?
[150:47.34]Answer?
[150:47.81]Nothing.
[150:49.09]Which is why I think we should at least consider the possibility that something less human in nature may be at work here.
[150:55.00]Ah, Joe.
[150:56.27]Alright, well...
[151:03.58]Where was that, um... Where was that code?
[151:07.24]I remember what room that was in.
[151:14.02]Engineer.
[151:15.17]Hi, I'm Nancy Drew.
[151:16.33]I talked to you before, very briefly.
[151:18.79]You're not the one who pulled the emergency brake, are you?
[151:22.12]No.
[151:22.43]Good.
[151:23.43]Because if you were, I'd have to come back there and throttle you.
[151:26.83]Old as this train is, it's a wonder it stayed on the tracks.
[151:31.84]It's the room I was just in.
[151:35.71]Okay, so you have no idea... Is there any way that a break could have... No, yeah.
[151:38.96]You don't know who did it?
[151:40.31]Where that bar is?
[151:43.47]It's in here?
[151:58.66]This little bar area.
[152:05.96]Where was it?
[152:06.51]It was in a weird spot.
[152:08.64]It was like that big, long, spell-of-word one.
[152:18.45]It's the one, it's the room with Lori in it.
[152:20.06]Is it really?
[152:20.56]I thought it was much, is it that far away?
[152:22.67]It's the one before the caboose, really?
[152:34.31]There's nothing else I can grab in here, right?
[152:38.70]I can't turn on the steam engine.
[152:44.15]Alright, well, I guess I'll just go all the way over there or whatever.
[152:55.34]Sorry, the train is moving again.
[153:07.17]You're gonna play Voices of the Void?
[153:09.72]Um... One day.
[153:13.22]One day I will.
[153:21.28]OK, here we go.
[153:22.01]So it's in here somewhere.
[153:28.58]Did I open all these?
[153:30.59]Oh, shit.
[153:31.54]Okay, I got an 8.
[153:34.05]That's kind of a big deal.
[153:38.51]This was the thing about blue green, blue green, blue green.
[153:44.69]Nothing in this one.
[153:47.13]I... Never mind, there is.
[153:49.36]She means...
[153:56.55]Yeah dude, he's gonna shove an entire Nancy Drew game up his ass.
[154:03.71]Um...
[154:06.92]Uh, whatever you said.
[154:13.94]Okay.
[154:15.14]So.
[154:17.23]I got a bunch of shit to do in this room, I think.
[154:20.27]Can't do anything with that.
[154:21.09]I need the lamp.
[154:22.52]I need all these materials.
[154:28.07]I only have one of them.
[154:43.93]Okay, well, I...
[154:44.98]It's gonna be six gems.
[154:47.11]Eventually.
[154:52.79]Okay.
[154:56.01]Alright, so now...
[154:58.92]I took a picture of this.
[154:59.67]What was it?
[155:08.97]Did I delete it?
[155:09.72]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[155:15.48]Okay, what was it?
[155:16.97]What was it?
[155:21.98]Something TBAA.
[155:26.29]TBAA.
[155:28.34]Something.
[155:38.84]I think it was N?
[155:50.59]NZ...
[155:51.35]I think it was NZVR.
[155:57.85]TBAA?
[156:02.62]NZ... NVZR.
[156:08.51]T-B-A-A That's not correct.
[156:12.93]N-V-R-Z T-B-A-A N-V-R-Z
[156:25.13]Jesus!
[156:27.28]Ow!
[156:32.57]Okay!
[156:40.00]I don't know
[156:49.97]Well, that's one step done.
[156:54.95]The pencil maybe?
[156:59.98]pencil.
[157:01.61]Draw on it?
[157:04.57]No.
[157:10.24]Although I can do one, right?
[157:13.18]Let me go back to the scale.
[157:24.68]Okay, here we go.
[157:25.45]So...
[157:30.41]So that's the square.
[157:34.52]Alright, Square is unlocked.
[157:46.03]So you do plus, um, how did I just get that to happen?
[157:59.02]How many other combinations can I do?
[158:00.27]Alright, that's four.
[158:02.78]So then I need to go four and then I have to go one.
[158:05.29]So wouldn't it be already one?
[158:07.58]Like this, right?
[158:08.64]No, fuck.
[158:15.95]Wouldn't one be duck already?
[158:34.53]Hmm.
[158:37.77]Do you have to do square, then duck?
[158:44.01]Because right now this is...
[158:46.28]I don't think I have enough.
[158:52.99]Because I need to, I guess maybe you have to have them all up there.
[158:58.29]Because the duck is, this one's lit up though.
[159:00.42]Does that mean anything else?
[159:03.82]I'm way ahead of the game right now.
[159:06.35]Switch these.
[159:06.95]That's +2.
[159:13.27]I think, yeah, I gotta find more.
[159:18.16]Well, that's activated, whatever it is.
[159:29.84]Let me, hold on, let me just see.
[159:45.27]Just any other combinations or whatever.
[159:57.54]I think I need more.
[160:01.06]Alright.
[160:02.32]So let's go to the dolls.
[160:03.31]Where are the dolls?
[160:08.22]Open this shit up.
[160:10.47]They find all the gemstones... ...who, through the emergency brake...
[160:17.87]Tell Frank and Joe Hardy that Jake Hurley apparently left the pickaxe.
[160:21.99]Alright, I gotta do that.
[160:23.93]I need all the items.
[160:25.48]Have I not?
[160:27.11]Let me call...
[160:27.75]Wait.
[160:28.37]Hold on.
[160:30.94]Best, you got info?
[160:33.23]She probably has info.
[160:37.31]Hello?
[160:37.92]Hi, Beth.
[160:38.65]Hey, what's going on?
[160:41.11]The name of the company that made Jake's wife's dancing shoes.
[160:44.58]The name of the company that made Jake's wife's dancing shoes is too faded to read.
[160:48.68]But to find Jake's mine, I need to know what it is.
[160:51.72]Hey, I know what you can do.
[160:53.10]Take a picture of him with your cell phone, then send it to us, and we'll check them out for you.
[160:57.54]But I thought you guys had to paint Bess's room.
[160:59.99]Boring.
[161:01.27]Besides, we're going to have to take a break soon because we're almost out of paint.
[161:04.60]Probably because Bess has gotten more
[161:08.12]Oh, you guys are the greatest.
[161:17.96]Okay.
[161:27.23]Let me...
[161:28.04]I...
[161:28.77]Listen.
[161:30.21]How do I move that gosh darn painting with the eagle on it?
[161:37.10]It doesn't want to go anywhere.
[161:38.65]There's something in Jake's car that can handle such weighty matters.
[161:41.96]But to use it, you need to take a good look at that painting and a good look at what's hanging in Camille's car, and then match a picture to a number.
[161:48.64]Oh, please.
[161:49.91]Okay.
[161:50.87]Ew.
[161:55.85]The metal kind of slugs.
[161:59.07]Actually just cheating.
[162:00.18]This is in the game.
[162:01.85]Alright.
[162:03.07]I got to take a picture of the shoes.
[162:24.58]Okay, here.
[162:31.03]Was it a good view?
[162:32.12]Right there?
[162:36.92]Alright, what do you got?
[162:45.59]Did you get the picture?
[162:51.06]Oh, please.
[162:52.71]Fine.
[162:54.17]Okay.
[162:59.66]Bye.
[163:04.24]Alright, so what else do I gotta do?
[163:07.61]I guess I get to go talk to the Hardy Boys.
[163:24.29]I need more slugs?
[163:28.21]Can't check that off yet.
[163:30.62]I mean, I know why they're there, but...
[163:32.70]Okay.
[163:33.09]I think I just gotta go talk to the Hardy Boys.
[163:38.67]I think that's the only thing I can do.
[163:47.02]Oh wait, what about the dolls?
[163:50.78]Can I actually do the doll puzzle?
[164:00.69]Now that it said, oh, and you need to do the dolls and take a look at the dolls.
[164:04.20]Something is interesting with them.
[164:07.57]What do you know?
[164:21.39]Alright, this one has his eyes closed.
[164:29.22]Uh, this one has a green and blue eye.
[164:32.01]Does that matter?
[164:38.96]Okay, that's the only one with the green and blue eye.
[164:41.60]Is that weird?
[164:42.80]One has its eyes closed.
[164:48.07]green eyes alright and she says mama with this one
[165:01.99]What about the clothes too?
[165:02.94]We've got blue, green, orange, yellow.
[165:06.32]Maybe if I put them by color?
[165:11.04]Are these blue or purple eyes?
[165:24.52]Two of them also don't have shoes.
[165:26.67]I guess that's true.
[165:32.75]Alright, what color are their shoes?
[165:35.04]This one has red shoes.
[165:38.14]You know, just for shits, I'm doing this.
[165:47.61]Okay, there's three like kind of yellow.
[165:51.01]There's one orange.
[165:54.77]This one's white.
[166:01.97]I don't think I'm doing this right.
[166:09.66]Yeah, why do you do that to this one only?
[166:14.71]Maybe by length of the skirt?
[166:36.85]I don't think I have the info.
[166:40.38]Alright, is there anybody with blue eyes?
[166:49.00]Do you all have blue eyes?
[166:50.47]I guess are these technically blue?
[166:57.07]You have your eyes closed and you have like purple eyes.
[167:01.10]Purple...
[167:03.12]Okay, okay, only two of these characters have green eyes and this look at this person has like a big diamond green necklace thing.
[167:19.48]What about that poem with the dolls?
[167:21.40]Oh, there's a poem.
[167:25.00]Alright, well, let's go.
[167:25.58]We got to go talk to the Hardy Boys.
[167:27.28]I got to get the hell out of here.
[167:34.31]Wait, can I go in the door behind you?
[167:39.72]Yes.
[167:41.99]Do you have any idea who threw the emergency brake?
[167:44.80]I know exactly who did it!
[167:46.59]Well what the fuck?
[167:47.35]You do?
[167:48.15]Well, who else could it be?
[167:49.94]Camille.
[167:51.42]None of us has any reason to stop the train, but Camille?
[167:54.91]She doesn't want us to find Jake's mine.
[167:57.04]So she's going to do whatever she can to keep its location a secret.
[168:02.67]Uh...
[168:03.01]Did you see something?
[168:04.46]Well, no.
[168:05.61]But I'll tell you what.
[168:06.97]Your friend, that Jim Harley guy?
[168:08.78]And how do you know that?
[168:18.94]How well do you know Charlene Purcell?
[168:21.37]I just know her from her books, which are so good.
[168:25.26]In fact, I just started reading her latest one.
[168:27.75]The moon tells no lies.
[168:30.44]See, what I'd really, really like to do is write romance.
[168:33.56]Oh, I don't know what just popped in my head.
[168:34.56]Everybody who knows me says I'd be really good at it.
[168:36.90]Like hearing somebody outside of like a window being like, bow to me.
[168:41.07]Bow, bow, peasant.
[168:44.54]Oh, that's funny.
[168:51.14]All 10,000 of you, bow to me.
[168:59.00]I'd be like, what is fucking going on?
[169:02.87]What could you possibly be talking about?
[169:11.05]Uh, I gotta go pee.
[169:13.82]I'll see you guys in like three or four minutes.
[169:20.08]This is gonna be hard.
[169:20.68]I actually cannot touch anything.
[169:23.36]Let me do this.
[169:25.25]Just in case this goes really horribly wrong.
[169:30.09]Okay.
[169:31.96]I cannot do anything, so I'm just going to get up and walk away.
[169:38.17]Okay.
[169:40.38]Sorry, I'll be right back in two or three minutes.
[169:42.06]I can't press any buttons.
[169:43.31]I can't do anything.
[169:47.72]Wait.
[169:52.65]Oh, if I still had access to letters, I could write BRB.
[170:06.91]What, um... On a keypad.
[170:09.24]How would you write BRB?
[170:12.75]It'd be... Two?
[170:17.66]Alright, that's BRB.
[170:27.06]Back in two or three minutes.
[171:15.84]Thank you.
[171:49.96]Thank you.
[174:05.84]Alright.
[174:27.24]Well, the bike is on.
[174:29.33]I can't believe it.
[174:39.25]What's up?
[174:42.74]Do you guys solve the puzzle yet?
[174:54.16]Okay.
[174:55.61]Where are we at in our adventure game?
[175:06.98]Oof.
[175:08.20]Alright.
[175:11.53]And where are we going?
[175:12.28]What am I doing?
[175:14.36]Who are you?
[175:15.36]What are you doing here?
[175:23.67]Can't do anything with this.
[175:26.81]At least not yet.
[175:30.32]Talk to the Hardy Boys.
[175:52.12]This should be a teleport.
[175:56.63]Alright, what do you two dickheads want to do?
[176:06.40]Who?
[176:07.46]Charlina and Lori.
[176:08.63]All we heard was the tail end of it.
[176:10.34]And unfortunately, we really couldn't make out what they were saying.
[176:13.03]So you don't know what they were arguing about?
[176:15.34]No.
[176:16.10]But whatever it was, both of them were absolutely out of their minds, livid.
[176:20.25]And it would probably be a good idea to find out why.
[176:22.77]Okay.
[176:24.39]Alright, so there's a big argument.
[176:29.49]What's the deal?
[176:36.45]What were you and Lori arguing about earlier today?
[176:39.73]Lori and I?
[176:40.83]We weren't arguing.
[176:41.96]We were simply discussing a topic about which both of us are... passionate, that's all.
[176:46.96]so what was it about you weren't angry no and even if we were that's really none of your business
[176:53.70]I know that sounds harsh, but really, Nancy, eavesdropping is so tacky.
[176:59.35]So it was a Dell computer in 2000.
[177:04.36]Should have a gateway, bro.
[177:14.08]A storyline that Laurie submitted to me found its way into my last book, despite the fact that she never received compensation for it.
[177:21.59]Oh, so you took her book idea.
[177:30.05]You stole one of her ideas?
[177:32.38]She had no business sending me unsolicited material.
[177:36.31]But technically, yes.
[177:39.46]Now legally she can't prove anything, and I'm certainly not about to admit anything.
[177:44.47]and it's not as if she needs the money.
[177:46.23]But that's what we were arguing about.
[177:49.49]Oh, yeah, it's always, yeah, I'm going to talk to some producer.
[177:52.08]I don't know.
[177:58.13]What's the matter with you?
[178:07.90]Were you able to find the name of Jake's train engineer?
[178:10.57]I came across three references to the fact that Jake had an engineer, but I'm afraid none of them included his name.
[178:16.96]You are just worthless, aren't you?
[178:22.78]Do you know them very well?
[178:24.27]I don't know them at all.
[178:25.62]Needless to say, I don't watch television, so I've never even seen Mr. Gray before.
[178:29.58]Although I do know that his profession, if you can call it that, is rife with crackpots.
[178:35.62]Okay.
[178:43.01]A matter of stealing somebody else's material?
[178:45.43]Oh, alright.
[178:46.92]I was wrong, sorry.
[178:48.65]Something else.
[178:50.64]In other words, you don't think he deserves all the attention he's getting?
[178:53.71]No.
[178:55.06]You and those two Boy Scouts you're with would make better detectives.
[178:59.09]Is that all, dear?
[179:01.51]Would you like to see the letter that Laurie gave me as a reward for finding her?
[179:04.82]The one in which Jake Hurley supposedly tells his niece how to find his lost mine?
[179:09.50]No, thank you.
[179:10.74]Okay.
[179:11.46]Okay.
[179:19.33]Aren't you even going to try finding out what happened to Jake Hurley?
[179:22.49]No time.
[179:24.32]I haven't insisted that Laurie release me from all the silliness is there's always the possibility that what happened to him has the makings of a bestseller.
[179:32.55]Although I highly doubt it.
[179:34.55]You look foolish as that sweater.
[179:40.49]I like that sweater.
[179:44.95]Why?
[179:45.33]He either doesn't have enough food or water or he encounters hostile natives.
[179:52.08]But why was his train found out in the middle of nowhere with just the dead engineer on board?
[179:57.08]That does make the story a little more interesting.
[180:00.58]My guess is the engineer got tired of waiting for Jake to return.
[180:04.30]took off in the train to get help, and died of a heart attack along the way, after which the train rolled to a stop in Blue Moon Canyon.
[180:12.40]Anyone experienced enough to single-handedly run a steam engine would have been quite a bit older than Jake.
[180:19.03]Do you know who may have pulled the emergency brake?
[180:22.49]Do you have a theory as to who pulled the emergency brake?
[180:25.41]Well, I know it wasn't me.
[180:26.82]I assume it wasn't you, and I highly doubt it was Lori.
[180:29.83]So that leaves those two friends of yours, Mr. Gray and Mr. Balducci.
[180:35.27]Have you ever run across a haunted house or train story?
[180:40.29]Have you run across many haunted train stories in the course of your research?
[180:44.28]A few.
[180:44.78]But most train-bound ghosts that I've come across seem to have better things to do than sit around pulling emergency brakes.
[180:52.45]What do you think happened to Camille?
[180:54.32]She probably died of something mundane like pneumonia or even measles.
[180:58.37]Now, if it was winter time when she died, and they were in the mountains, Jake no doubt kept her body on the train for months before he buried her.
[181:06.32]I'll let you get back to your writing.
[181:13.23]My publisher thanks you.
[181:18.48]Okay.
[181:20.92]So, what the heck?
[181:26.01]I found a diagram for some kind of contraption that Jake designed, but to operate it you need his pickaxe and some kind of lamp or lantern.
[181:33.65]Which it looks like he gave to somebody named Buell.
[181:37.05]Buell?
[181:38.28]Joe, show her.
[181:39.28]What do you got?
[181:39.92]That old picture we found.
[181:41.75]Uh, okay.
[181:43.62]We found this on the bookshelf.
[181:45.23]See?
[181:45.87]Buell's Supplies and Pawn Shop.
[181:48.00]That's gotta be the same Buell Jake gave his axe and lantern to.
[181:50.75]Yeah, a hundred years ago and the guy was a pawnbroker Frank the steps probably long gone or maybe it's still somewhere in copper gorge
[181:58.11]Well, let's stop there.
[181:58.99]Let's go to Copper Gorge.
[182:08.05]I'll bet he does.
[182:09.29]He just doesn't want you to show him up again.
[182:10.96]Yeah, he wants you to do all the legworks with the last minute.
[182:13.85]Bam!
[182:14.39]He can swoop in and grab all the credit.
[182:16.20]I wouldn't tell him a thing, Nance.
[182:17.79]Unless it's to get lost.
[182:19.28]Uh, these two are based?
[182:23.32]Excuse me?
[182:26.26]Alright, this doesn't work, right?
[182:30.56]No, I cannot.
[182:32.04]Alright, what can I do now?
[182:42.15]Still waiting for them to call me back.
[182:45.39]Let's look at the notes.
[182:47.28]I already did that.
[182:49.47]Okay.
[182:50.89]We threw...
[182:51.80]I did not...
[182:52.50]Didn't Laurie say she threw the brake?
[182:55.77]I swear Laurie said that.
[182:57.06]She's like, oh, I did it, didn't she?
[183:04.58]Oh, she said it was Camille.
[183:05.89]Okay, so I gotta talk to the other people about that.
[183:14.01]She said the ghost did it.
[183:28.98]No, I gotta talk to the detective, right?
[183:32.46]What's up?
[183:34.80]Apparently there's some objects you haven't inspected that might hide useful items.
[183:41.06]Applying force to an object by distorting its electromagnetic field requires... That's so funny.
[183:46.01]Josh, that is like the best way.
[183:47.84]I like almost want that to pop up, fade in as white text on the top left of the screen.
[183:56.01]to say like, hey, dude, you're missing an incredibly important item that's in like the first briefcase that you walked by.
[184:08.53]Stop talking to this charlatan.
[184:13.98]That's point-and-click games, really.
[184:19.51]Did I not click on something very early on?
[184:25.10]Okay.
[184:26.49]but it's possible ask me again at the end of this trip that's what a junior detective does if we make it that far and something also tells me that's a pretty big if
[184:35.48]You're inattentive and not doing a good job.
[184:38.21]Why did you say apparently before that?
[184:39.98]What do you mean like allegedly you're inattentive?
[184:43.47]I'm very attentive.
[184:44.80]You don't have to like allege it.
[184:49.93]So are you making any progress in here?
[184:52.19]Oh yeah, not only am I getting some real unusual EMRs, that's electromagnetic readings, but take a look at this.
[184:58.38]What do you got?
[184:59.02]You've got something?
[185:00.01]I set up a camera and took some time lapse photos.
[185:03.42]Sometimes I was in the room, sometimes I wasn't, but somewhere along the line.
[185:07.29]I managed to get a shot of Camille.
[185:09.52]Where?
[185:10.83]You don't mean that little blob, do you?
[185:13.38]Yep, that's Camille.
[185:15.88]Okay.
[185:17.26]You're skeptical.
[185:18.29]That's cool.
[185:18.95]Just remember, the key word when it comes to ghostly phenomena is energy.
[185:23.91]That blob is the result of Camille's residual life force.
[185:26.87]That's a nothing burger.
[185:35.91]That's a nothing burger.
[185:38.84]Alright, I did that, right?
[185:45.23]That was fun.
[185:48.28]Did I touch this thing?
[185:53.51]Is that the Abraham Lincoln guy?
[186:04.06]That's like a weird thing.
[186:05.78]I can't touch that.
[186:10.92]Let me talk to the detective again.
[186:15.60]What about this couch?
[186:16.44]Green couch?
[186:20.92]Um...
[186:21.56]I guess I can just take that now, and I couldn't before.
[186:23.73]Cool.
[186:24.17]Alright.
[186:24.81]Great.
[186:27.70]Okay, Nancy.
[186:28.38]I did that.
[186:36.21]I can't touch these.
[186:40.02]You had no reason to get those before.
[186:41.61]That's true.
[186:43.76]Did that.
[186:45.91]Alright, let's talk to you.
[186:52.42]Nope.
[187:02.72]Uh, yep.
[187:03.44]Sure, here it is.
[187:07.59]I've seen enough.
[187:10.24]Two words, useless.
[187:13.16]Those are just the rantings of a guy who spent way too much of his life
[187:16.30]swirling mud around and pandering to the hot sun.
[187:19.38]Five-star nut job.
[187:22.04]Hmm.
[187:22.70]Hmm.
[187:29.55]Did you find any fingerprints on the emergency brake handle?
[187:32.62]None that were any help, thanks to Casey Jones up there.
[187:36.26]I told the old geezer not to touch anything, but he went and got his big, fat, oily paw prints all over the place.
[187:42.72]If we didn't need him to drive the train, I'd charge him with obstruction of justice.
[187:46.25]So, you have no idea who threw the brake?
[187:49.85]Whoa, I didn't say that.
[187:52.10]As a matter of fact,
[187:52.89]Why does he say this at an empty desk all day?
[187:57.52]Looks like some kind of thermometer.
[187:59.67]Yeah, like the kind a certain ghost hunter uses on that boy's show of his.
[188:04.97]You think John Gray threw the brake?
[188:07.34]But why would he do that?
[188:08.98]Because they're thinking about axing his show, that's why.
[188:12.03]I checked with this buddy of mine in L.A. Gray's gotta come up with something real big, real soon.
[188:17.97]Or he's toast.
[188:18.96]And you can't get much bigger than a train with a spooky past that's prone to strange accidents, now can you?
[188:25.66]Have you confronted John with your suspicions?
[188:28.15]All in due time.
[188:29.49]I always like to get my ducks in a row before I make an arrest.
[188:33.72]Could that be somebody else's thermometer?
[188:43.16]I know what I'm doing, sweetheart.
[188:44.86]I actually am.
[188:45.33]That's exactly what I'm going to give him.
[188:52.22]How did you and Lori meet?
[188:54.05]We met at a party in New York.
[188:57.02]Nice girl.
[188:58.05]Not a lot of stairs, but nice girl.
[189:01.25]Where's Jake Hurley?
[189:06.05]Where is he hiding?
[189:07.63]And why is he... Oh.
[189:10.12]He died like a hundred years ago.
[189:17.83]What did you find?
[189:19.26]Sorry, can't go into detail.
[189:21.20]Let's just say that thanks to yours truly, what happened to Jake Hurley won't be a mystery much longer.
[189:27.62]Alright.
[189:28.44]So.
[189:33.84]Interesting.
[189:36.91]Interesting.
[189:39.16]Interesting.
[189:43.38]Oh, school.
[189:47.18]Did you see what happened?
[189:49.17]Chandelier started bobbin scope!
[189:52.37]Yeah, let's get in here!
[190:13.35]Call me about that... this... shoes!
[190:21.02]Why have you not called me about the shoes yet?
[190:33.50]Wait for your dumb ass to call me?
[190:37.45]Get on it!
[190:39.36]Oh.
[190:39.90]Whoa.
[190:52.82]That's French for shimmering socks.
[191:03.30]So how does this help us?
[191:09.32]Got it.
[191:09.98]Thanks, guys.
[191:10.99]Thanks for letting us help.
[191:13.63]I'll talk to you guys later.
[191:14.93]Remember, when in doubt, call.
[191:19.09]It's the order of the dolls.
[191:25.33]Like C?
[191:28.90]Wait.
[191:34.42]Shota Shotaian Shotaian
[191:45.54]What is that?
[191:46.29]What about the doll poem?
[191:49.49]I'm gonna read the doll poem.
[192:08.63]Scheiße!
[192:11.56]Scheiße!
[192:15.71]Alright, where's that darn doll poem?
[192:22.75]Make a, make a, make a, make a wish.
[192:24.51]I'll be past you.
[192:27.59]Ill-tempered Edna could not get her way.
[192:30.32]She couldn't get Alice to come out and play.
[192:32.94]"'I can't, I'm too tired,' is what Alice said."
[192:37.01]I just want to go straight back to bed.
[192:38.62]Alice is the one sleeping.
[192:42.31]Edna angrily tried to make herself heard, but all that came out was one two-part word.
[192:50.27]Why, I'm not your mother.
[192:52.70]Yawning Alice replied, till Edna the Terrible finally gave up and cried.
[193:02.12]Okay, so Alice is the sleeping one, and Edna is the angry one?
[193:06.35]Is there like a screaming one?
[193:09.02]Are crying?
[193:10.11]Edna, is Edna crying?
[193:14.64]So we got Edna crying, Alice sleeping.
[193:19.64]What else?
[193:20.10]Maybe each line is one of the dolls.
[193:26.48]I think there's just two of them.
[193:28.23]The Tale of Two Dolls.
[193:37.74]The two-part word is mama.
[193:41.74]Oh, that makes sense.
[193:43.25]Yeah!
[193:44.75]Okay, so we know three of the dolls then.
[193:49.96]Kind of?
[193:51.79]Bro, I don't fucking know
[193:53.32]Hey, how's it going?
[193:54.81]Tino found one of John Gray's thermometers by the emergency brake handle and is getting ready to throw the book at him.
[194:00.58]John Gray threw the emergency brake?
[194:02.86]Why would he do that?
[194:05.22]Lava.
[194:12.17]I still say there's less to all this than meets the eye, if you get my drift.
[194:16.14]I get your drift, Joe.
[194:17.65]Dude I've got such a nice Cabernet Sauvignon.
[194:23.98]Coming up for the top 300 games list.
[194:34.48]Alright, we gotta go talk to Ghost Guy.
[194:43.91]Nothing weird with this, right?
[194:48.03]That was just a red herring.
[194:51.86]This eagle shit, no.
[194:54.56]Anything else that I can do?
[194:55.91]Like touch or activate or...
[195:03.87]Can't go outside until the train stops.
[195:12.87]The doll names are around the whole train.
[195:15.27]I figured as much.
[195:19.13]You got anything behind you?
[195:21.73]No.
[195:28.38]Well, I can take this now.
[195:29.44]Oh, I got, okay, I got six.
[195:31.76]I need, uh, I got three stones.
[195:34.69]Cool.
[195:36.20]This game is sick, dude.
[195:37.75]I'm so fucking pumped up now.
[195:42.37]I'm, dude, I'm biting my lip right now.
[195:44.42]I am fucking antsy to get this crime solved.
[195:55.02]Okay.
[195:56.23]Hey!
[195:56.87]Hey, what's up?
[195:57.90]What do you- what?
[196:01.55]Uh-huh.
[196:11.54]This is what an MRI machine sounds like before you get in it.
[196:27.59]Camille.
[196:36.42]So be careful what you say in here.
[196:39.15]She's listening.
[196:41.12]Are you by any chance missing a small digital thermometer?
[196:45.22]Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.
[196:47.05]When I went through the box I packed them in, that one over there,
[196:50.30]I came up one short.
[196:51.91]I was hoping to set up at least six in here so I could check for cold spots How did you know I was missing one?
[196:57.46]Because Tino Balducci found it by the emergency brake handle when he was dusting... We got you red handed.
[197:02.46]And now he thinks you're the one who...
[197:03.80]My teeth.
[197:05.86]Ow, my teeth broke.
[197:10.00]Is it true that your show is in danger, bro?
[197:12.37]Is it true that your show is in danger of being canceled?
[197:15.87]Newsflash, my show was canceled.
[197:19.20]Happened last night.
[197:20.27]But what nobody knows yet is that it's been picked up by a major TV network.
[197:24.43]Oh, my teeth!
[197:32.19]Were you in the room the whole time?
[197:34.10]Were you in this room the whole time prior to that emergency break thing?
[197:37.54]Of course not.
[197:38.56]I made a couple of trips to my compartment in the sleeping car to get more equipment.
[197:42.59]But did I get an overpowering urge to pull the emergency brake while I was there?
[197:45.96]No.
[197:48.78]Dentures fell out.
[197:49.89]Pleasure talking to you.
[197:51.46]Okay, we got no new info.
[197:55.19]I'm just gonna start smashing my hands on the piano, like walking around like a fucking cat.
[197:59.39]Alright.
[198:00.22]What about this?
[198:01.18]It's locked.
[198:05.28]I need a stone.
[198:21.26]I need a stone.
[198:27.51]Wait.
[198:31.25]Where do I... Where do I go?
[198:38.44]Oh, it's where the pickaxe goes.
[198:42.52]Okay, well I don't have a pickaxe.
[198:46.49]Hmm.
[198:53.85]Rearrange the dolls.
[198:55.47]Okay.
[198:56.09]I called Bess.
[199:04.66]Who threw the break?
[199:05.61]We don't know.
[199:06.21]Spyglass lamp.
[199:08.44]I got the map.
[199:11.39]I found out who made the shoes.
[199:15.80]Okay, the letter's at the caboose.
[199:19.61]I need more slugs.
[199:20.80]Have I not seen any?
[199:27.24]Dude, I'm missing one coin somewhere.
[199:29.27]There's got to be a coin that's on the ground or something that I didn't get like four hours ago.
[199:34.54]It's got to be something stupid like that, right?
[200:00.55]What's the name?
[200:02.52]Okay, this one's Alice.
[200:05.87]Where's the crying one?
[200:09.62]You're not crying.
[200:12.40]You're not crying.
[200:14.29]Where's the crying one?
[200:17.18]No.
[200:19.03]Sleeping.
[200:19.91]Are you crying?
[200:30.37]Is this the one that was crying?
[200:32.38]So this is Edna.
[200:35.34]What's the name of this person?
[200:41.41]How many letters is the name?
[200:50.49]No, the like Chateau Chateau, whatever the name, the actual name.
[200:55.48]shy okay one two I'm just seeing how what the letters see one two three four
[201:03.72]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[201:05.02]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[201:08.65]Alright, there are 11 dolls.
[201:13.17]Are there 11 letters in this person's first name?
[201:19.37]Or is it the last name?
[201:26.18]You gotta write stuff down to get this or it's actually impossible.
[201:36.72]Edna and Alice is all I have.
[201:46.51]Uh, okay, well I...
[201:48.28]I'm just gonna write that down.
[201:52.81]I'm gonna write down...
[201:55.88]Okay, here.
[202:01.92]Alright, Edna crying.
[202:06.42]And then Mama.
[202:08.74]And then Alice is, uh, sleeping.
[202:16.55]Okay.
[202:18.01]So I wrote that down.
[202:24.39]Girl with the two left feet?
[202:29.53]Oh shit!
[202:31.21]I never would have figured that out.
[202:33.00]I literally just read that.
[202:34.20]Holy fucking moly.
[202:35.79]Okay, what was that person's name?
[202:40.22]It was like Sandra or something?
[202:44.24]Okay, that's Sadie Crawford.
[202:47.28]Alright, so now we have Sadie.
[202:52.86]Those shoes were huge!
[202:56.24]Those shoes do not fit there.
[202:58.39]I'm sorry.
[202:59.78]That's like ten times bigger than her whole body.
[203:02.92]I didn't know they were little doll shoes.
[203:12.62]Okay.
[203:17.66]What was this one's name?
[203:22.18]Sadie,
[203:31.61]Sadie Crawford, okay.
[203:33.28]Sadie Crawford.
[203:34.43]And I wrote, okay, Sadie Crawford, and I said left feet.
[203:37.55]There.
[203:37.87]Alright, we got three of them, I guess.
[203:42.18]How does, why does that matter?
[203:48.23]Okay.
[203:49.74]Um...
[203:56.65]I need to do something.
[203:58.26]I feel like I've done a whole lot of nothing, but I've learned a whole lot more.
[204:03.53]It's interesting.
[204:04.08]Alright.
[204:05.26]I don't know who threw the break.
[204:11.97]I gotta find a coin, dude.
[204:13.06]There's a coin just sitting somewhere.
[204:15.15]And I'm gonna lose my mind when I see it.
[204:16.54]It's gotta be looking like a round somewhere.
[204:26.87]Right?
[204:27.42]Hold on.
[204:27.72]Don't just run by these.
[204:29.92]You know what I'm saying?
[204:30.54]There's gonna be one sitting on a shelf.
[204:42.77]What the fuck is this?
[204:48.51]Carbide.
[204:49.34]Just what I need to make that lamp I found work.
[204:52.56]Dude, I got some carbite.
[205:02.73]Anything else?
[205:04.12]Carbide.
[205:04.94]Just what I need to make that lamp I found work.
[205:07.31]Okay, cool.
[205:08.86]What about- what about Pickaxe?
[205:10.21]Pickaxe is gone.
[205:14.41]I can't touch anything else.
[205:17.16]Oh, that's such horseshit.
[205:26.29]I'm looking for coins.
[205:33.24]Coin in the couch, maybe?
[205:34.31]That's... Why would it want me to look at the couch?
[205:38.08]Wait.
[205:41.55]Eliza.
[205:42.81]Hold on.
[205:44.06]I gotta write this one down.
[205:49.63]Received Jake Hurley for the price of $3.73.
[205:53.17]A doll with decorative red ribbon.
[205:58.15]Okay, Red Ribbon is Eliza Sandberger.
[206:08.88]And that's the one with a big red ribbon?
[206:13.98]Okay.
[206:15.85]Edna Alice Sadie Crawford and then Eliza Sandberger.
[206:20.55]Got it.
[206:27.36]Any of the doll names that I forgot to write down?
[206:36.93]There's a gem in here?
[206:37.98]Mr. Gem Sad.
[206:39.33]What do you mean, Gem Sad?
[206:49.99]Where?

[207:17.24]That could be one of the gems I need.
[207:19.58]Maybe Tino will let me take a closer look.
[207:22.19]Alright, Tino.
[207:23.55]Give me that gem.
[207:24.96]Or you're under arrest for the murder of Camille Sandberger.
[207:32.53]Do you think I could take a closer look at that cougar statue?
[207:35.70]What, that cigar clipper?
[207:37.67]Go ahead, take a look.
[207:45.02]Alright, this is a great opportunity to do a voice.
[207:53.05]Interesting I just wanted to get a good so I got to get them out of the rooms.

[208:05.12]I need to get them out of the room.
[208:08.05]Both this and the ghost guy.
[208:12.91]Oh man, I'm close to uninstalling by the way.
[208:16.35]Really close to uninstalling.
[208:29.59]I gotta get that other grate open.
[208:34.22]I'm uninstalling the game.
[208:38.70]Oh, Sickly Sarah.

[210:53.63]Okay.
[210:55.15]Awful Ursula.

[211:10.15]One, two, three, four, five.
[211:11.28]I've got six so far.
[211:25.24]What's that one?
[211:25.78]What's that one?
[211:26.32]That's the name right there.
[211:28.51]I can't read that.
[211:29.51]Tom... Thomas... O'Neil?
[211:38.81]This is blue.
[211:39.55]What is this like a hair?

[211:52.19]This is like a piece of hair?
[211:56.36]It's like a blue lock of hair.
[211:58.19]I'm just gonna write blue hair.
[212:01.66]Blue hair lock.
[212:04.70]Okay.
[212:09.32]I feel like I'm pretty close to being able to get that.

[216:10.79]I don't think that's it.
[216:12.46]And in fact, I think that now the chat's going to go fucking crazy.
[216:21.88]I thought you meant the AutoMod.
[216:27.40]Where do we...
[216:28.71]The name of this fucking French painter, whatever his name is.

[217:06.53]Okay.
[217:06.87]Awful Ursula.
[217:09.21]I see.
[217:10.01]I see.
[217:10.86]What about Thomas O'Neil?
[217:14.64]uh-huh yep okay check this out watch this I didn't I didn't read this an hour and a half ago
[217:21.12]You fucking wankers.
[217:22.96]I figured this out all by myself after reading it in somebody's chat an hour ago.
[217:28.58]We got... C-H...
[217:33.96]Okay, uh...
[217:37.08]AU is Awful Ursula.
[217:39.29]Awful Ursula is Red Hair Yellow Dress.
[217:42.00]You are the second doll.
[217:48.74]Because that's A-U.
[217:49.77]Awful Ursula.
[217:50.65]Okay, what about S-S?
[217:52.18]S-S is Sickly Sarah.
[217:55.49]I would have figured this out.
[217:57.04]I already did.
[218:00.20]Do we have a C-H?
[218:02.33]No.
[218:04.83]Okay.
[218:05.68]What about E-T?
[218:09.34]No.
[218:11.11]Wait, maybe Edna.
[218:14.02]Edna could be E.T.
[218:17.08]Let's go with that.
[218:22.17]Uh, then T E don't have that yet.
[218:29.21]E.S.
[218:30.80]Is Eliza Sandberger possible?
[218:37.63]Okay, what about A-T?
[218:40.14]Could be Alice.
[218:45.41]O-Y.
[218:46.24]Don't have that.
[218:48.17]A N don't have that.
[218:52.93]T-E, don't have that.

[219:17.57]10.
[219:18.10]Alright, there are 11 dolls.
[219:22.06]Okay, I see how they're fucking with you.
[219:25.30]There's not enough letters to do this.
[219:26.77]You have to take the last letter...
[219:32.02]Okay.
[219:33.70]Can somebody paste that in my chat again?
[219:37.22]The name of the French painter?
[219:43.59]Because the last letter of the first name and the first letter of the last name are also just, you know, just pin it in chat.
[219:51.50]Yeah, that's a good place to put it.
[219:58.29]Okay.
[220:02.64]Hey, sorry for saying a termite could do this before, earlier.
[220:07.76]You are not forgiven, but I got over it.
[220:12.63]You're not forgiven.
[220:18.99]There's probably another four-hour cooldown before that happens.
[220:24.72]Apology accepted, but not forgiven.
[220:30.10]Alright, here we go.
[220:31.08]So I need a...
[220:32.17]So CH don't have that.
[220:33.60]AU is awful Ursula, which is here.
[220:36.36]Then we got SS, which is Sickly Sarah.
[220:40.76]Great.
[220:42.37]ET, which is potentially...
[220:45.12]Um... Edna?
[220:48.20]Maybe?
[220:50.08]We don't have TE.
[220:53.12]So we do have SC.
[220:55.21]Right?
[220:55.87]Because that's Sadie Crawford.
[220:57.28]So Sadie Crawford has the two left feet.
[220:59.77]She goes here.
[221:01.15]And that's kind of all I can do.
[221:02.80]Is there a TO?
[221:04.21]There is.
[221:05.87]Alright, that's all I can do for now.
[221:07.38]That's all I can do for now.
[221:09.32]Hope it saves up.
[221:13.92]Time for a brain blast?
[221:16.35]Uh, no, we're good.
[221:19.93]Alright, but I... Is there a fucking coin that I didn't pick up?
[221:23.50]Can't check that off yet.

[221:34.54]Haven't done that yet.
[221:36.03]Can't check that off yet.
[221:39.69]Alright, that four number shit.
[221:43.02]Haven't done that yet.
[221:47.69]What would I do with ET?
[221:49.14]I would smoke the fattest joint with that guy.
[221:53.84]Yes?
[221:55.55]Guess I better get to work.
[221:56.99]You go girl!
[222:08.26]You've read a story with one already.
[222:10.81]Yeah...
[222:12.42]It's true.
[222:13.90]Alright, let me go back to the very, like, first car.
[222:18.52]I only have this.
[222:19.38]I can't do that.
[222:19.95]I need another coin, dude.
[222:21.05]Where the fuck is another coin?
[222:25.33]I can't get him to leave either.
[222:32.29]There was a story about a doll getting dropped on its head and cracking.
[222:35.14]I remember that.
[222:37.07]I don't remember where it was though.
[222:39.60]Wait.
[222:42.23]Here we go.
[222:44.20]Thank you for giving the doll we called Teddy... Teddy Eberhardt a home.
[222:53.55]Teddy Eberhardt.
[222:54.65]We don't know what Teddy Eberhardt looks like though.
[223:03.71]T-E, yeah, but we don't know what the doll looks like.
[223:12.76]Nothing with the box, right?
[223:15.69]Maybe that's the outfit or something?
[223:21.43]No.
[223:23.14]Okay.
[223:47.15]It was in a draw somewhere.
[223:48.62]I don't know why I don't remember what draw is.
[223:54.56]Fuck.
[223:55.79]What the hell did this even do?
[223:56.94]What did any of that do?
[224:09.04]Weren't these games made for children and two parents?
[224:11.69]Or any parent or guardian?
[224:15.00]It actually says that on the back of the box.
[224:17.15]It says...
[224:18.49]for ages 12 and up.
[224:20.76]And then with an asterisk on it, it says, with parent or guardian.
[224:31.97]Are these supposed to be dolls?
[224:42.33]Yeah, we already know your name.
[224:51.05]I'm just seeing if there's any other doll things.
[225:00.10]Fuck.

[225:25.93]Alright, Teddy Teddy.
[225:28.77]Burhart.
[225:37.80]Already did that one.
[225:51.60]There's a hallway floor coin.
[225:56.44]He's getting discouraged.
[225:58.82]I'm not getting discouraged.
[226:04.02]I'm just trying to find these little fucking little pieces of paper on the ground of like, oh, by the way, she had red hair and her name was Sally.
[226:23.51]Did they make a doll that looks like this person?
[226:30.57]We're at a party and we're watching you right now.
[226:33.04]Alright, well... Let's go!
[226:34.79]Alright.

[227:40.26]We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[227:43.89]We got ten dolls.
[227:45.46]We can definitely solve it now.
[227:53.19]Because even if I don't have one, I can just kind of put it where I think it needs to go.
[227:56.60]I think we're good to go.
[227:59.73]This is going to be a huge moment here.

[239:56.77]I told them say nothing.
[239:58.34]Stop it.
[239:58.82]It's not cool.
[240:02.92]They are saying some stuff.
[240:04.09]Alright, but hold on.
[240:06.88]What were you doing today, Stuart?
[240:08.65]What were you up to?
[240:13.69]It was right there.
[240:14.38]There was no cone in the ground.
[240:20.41]Looks like I can turn, what is it?
[240:21.72]Can I turn that on?
[240:22.76]What is that though?
[240:25.86]He was deadlocking.
[240:29.89]He's back to Deadlock?
[240:33.67]Is he the best in the world yet?
[240:43.19]Can I not open this?
[240:45.80]He lost a bunch of his games.
[240:47.11]Well, that's not his fault though.
[240:48.23]He's...
[240:50.56]He's the ultimate gamer.
[240:51.46]What are you talking about?
[240:53.37]Don't say he lost in most of his games.
[240:56.38]It's a team game.
[240:57.93]What you should say is him and his team
[241:01.13]and then in parentheses, which were not very good, lost games today.
[241:11.37]Don't put all the slugs on the scale.
[241:26.61]Hmm.
[241:29.16]21 plus gets you there.
[241:34.08]Well, that's plus 5 too.
[241:44.08]9 plus 10.
[241:52.40]This one lit up for a second, though, didn't it?
[241:55.60]You're stupid.
[241:56.53]I don't even know what I'm trying to make here.
[242:05.74]I don't think I have enough floor coins to do this.
[242:07.95]21 is 6-7 for zoomers.
[242:13.86]Oh, it's the original.
[242:15.70]Oh, I get you.
[242:16.42]Okay.
[242:16.79]Why?
[242:17.09]What are you talking about?
[242:18.00]I've never heard of that.
[242:30.60]Okay, so what's some new shit that I got?
[242:32.81]I gotta get... Can't check that off yet.
[242:39.60]I can't get all the gemstones.
[242:41.20]He has to leave the room.
[242:42.85]I still don't know who threw the car.
[242:45.96]Who threw the brakes to the car.
[242:49.27]Please, it's in this hallway.
[242:50.52]You know, I'm not doing that again.
[242:51.88]No, dude.
[242:57.74]There's nothing on the ground!
[242:59.02]Alright, actually, start fucking zapping people.
[243:03.82]To tell me to get the coin on the ground.
[243:13.62]He got me all paranoid.
[243:27.76]Hey, how's it going?
[243:28.74]Anything else?
[243:29.04]Were you able to find anything out about Jake's engineer, that James Thurston guy?
[243:33.33]Good news and bad news.
[243:34.77]The good news is he had a wife in Copper Gorge, so he may have had children.
[243:38.37]Bad news is our internet service provider stopped providing before we could use our cell phones to find out anything else.
[243:44.24]That's okay.
[243:44.96]We can do more checking when we get to Copper Gorge.
[243:47.79]Right.
[243:50.13]I, I, I, what?
[243:52.62]Have we arrived?
[243:53.50]This cutscene.
[244:00.88]Oh this is a great cutscene.
[244:04.01]I guess we're here.
[244:14.94]Why am I playing funny little Hearthstone click-on stuff?
[244:17.62]Okay, wait.
[244:18.93]Add this taffy in here?
[244:20.42]Hey there!
[244:21.41]Welcome to Buell's old-time taffy house!
[244:24.07]Come on over here!
[244:25.44]Welcome, stranger!
[244:27.23]Listen, you by any chance get here on that private train what's parked out yonder?
[244:31.07]I would love to be one of these guys.
[244:37.86]I'd be one of these guys.
[244:39.51]Dang, if that don't beat all.
[244:41.82]I've read every single book that gal's ever written.
[244:44.15]Best writer what ever lived.
[244:45.72]Did she get off the train too?
[244:47.60]I don't think so.
[244:48.63]She's pretty busy.
[244:50.68]I feel like nobody messes with him.
[244:56.96]Well, welcome, little missy.
[244:59.27]Go on in and take a gander at what life was like during the heyday of Copper Gorge whilst you sample some of our delicious...
[245:05.55]Saltwater taffy is S tier, by the way, but let's get back on topic.
[245:14.04]If you carry around a big jug that has just three X's on it,
[245:19.91]And you can fill it with water.
[245:21.07]It doesn't even matter.
[245:22.93]You don't even have to be drinking whatever weird booze is in there.
[245:26.95]fill it with water and you have to just stumble around the town and be like, oh,
[245:31.37]Hey, stranger.
[245:37.78]People will just kind of ignore you.
[245:43.82]Nobody wants that guy to come on a mission with them.
[245:47.04]Nobody wants that.
[245:47.95]But people don't want to mess with the guy either because he's crazy.
[245:56.73]A hoodie for $27?
[246:01.95]That is kind of crazy.
[246:04.49]You're a side quest?
[246:05.54]That's fine.
[246:06.40]My side quest would be like, I'm looking for a piece of delicious bread.
[246:12.42]Adventurer, could you find me a piece of bread?
[246:15.16]It doesn't matter how hard it is.
[246:18.62]Look at how many teeth I have.
[246:20.41]And I would just pull my mouth up and it would just be black.
[246:27.56]I wouldn't have a care in the world.
[246:32.96]So this is some kind of museum?
[246:35.39]Why, it's the best kind of museum, sister.
[246:38.82]It's free.
[246:40.00]You can gape and gawk and ooh and aah to your heart's content.
[246:42.95]At least you can till I close up.
[246:46.12]What time do you close?
[246:49.49]Well, I mean, after dark.
[246:51.54]No, it's not the time.
[246:52.18]What time do you close?
[246:53.58]Where'd all this stuff come from?
[246:55.25]Been in the family for years.
[246:57.77]For centuries, in fact.
[246:59.79]See, Buell was my great-great-uncle.
[247:02.61]This building used to be his general store.
[247:05.01]during the glory days back in the 1880s he commenced a pawn brokering so the miners Copper Gorge was crawling with back then could raise some cash to pay for grub and tools and such
[247:14.96]That's the best scene in any movie ever.
[247:18.91]And there was Uncle Butte.
[247:20.26]That's the best scene ever.
[247:21.01]With a whole store full of junk.
[247:23.30]Only it wasn't junk to him.
[247:25.15]Yeah.
[247:25.88]Friendo.
[247:28.27]Yeah.
[247:34.13]My great-granddad is the one who come up with the idea of turning the place into a tourist attraction.
[247:40.27]Do you make money selling taffy?
[247:48.37]No offense, but it doesn't look like you're attracting that many tourists.
[247:52.17]That's because it's the off-season.
[247:53.77]Come summer, we're rolling in tourists.
[247:56.28]Mostly on account of the taffy.
[247:58.03]Tourists just love taffy, especially when you dangle a free sample in front of them to get them hooked.
[248:03.99]Of course, it ain't really free
[248:05.72]Some Daffy on a stick will cost you two tokens, which you can get by winning both those games over there.
[248:10.92]Oh.
[248:14.01]Just watch me.
[248:14.89]How much does it cost to play them?
[248:16.31]Well, ain't you the little penny pincher.
[248:18.97]Fact of the matter is they're free.
[248:20.52]Unless you go messing with the artifacts I got in here.
[248:23.98]Do that and you'll be headfirst in the nearest snowdrift before you know what hit you.
[248:29.20]Okay.
[248:31.15]Do you by any chance have any of Jake Hurley's things in here?
[248:34.21]Jake who?
[248:34.95]Hurley.
[248:35.46]He was a miner.
[248:36.50]I think he may have left a lamp and a pickaxe with your great,
[248:39.02]Ooh, this is where I get the pickaxe and the stones.
[248:48.23]Don't touch.
[248:49.82]It was fun talking to you.
[248:51.14]Ditto, little missy.
[248:53.51]Okay, how about some taffy?
[248:55.36]Looks like to get some taffy on a stick, I'm going to need two different tokens.
[249:00.46]Okay?
[249:01.27]I gotta play the game over here.
[249:03.64]And the game is called Smash Register and Take Money Out of Register.
[249:17.22]Alright, let's go.
[249:22.33]Did I win?
[249:30.69]I can't tell who's winning.
[249:45.84]Oh, I lost.
[249:46.76]Wait, okay, so these ones are bad.
[249:56.08]How are you supposed to beat this without just absolute luck?
[250:12.35]Get in there!
[250:18.96]That kind of sounds like the pepino scream.
[250:39.05]You can hold it down.
[250:47.12]Yahoo!
[250:48.31]Yoo-hoo!
[251:02.22]Don't.
[251:05.29]Come on, get in there.
[251:08.88]Come on.
[251:12.53]Do it very lightly, I think.
[251:37.94]Yahoo!
[251:49.21]Get up there!
[251:51.20]It really is Mario.
[252:09.80]That's so loud.
[252:11.87]Alright, I get my coin, right?
[252:16.77]Excellent.
[252:19.66]Is there another game to play?
[252:20.50]Do I have to beat that twice?
[252:21.80]No, what's this one?
[252:23.99]Uh, bet on the horse.
[252:25.38]Uh, we always go... We always go, uh, white, number nine.
[252:42.17]It's fine.
[252:51.82]Thank you.
[253:04.48]Loser.
[253:06.30]Red again?
[253:11.73]uh okay let let chat decide okay go ahead bet which one do you think is gonna win go ahead you can do a prediction here
[253:34.46]I'm staying with my choice.
[253:37.28]Whatever you wanna do is whatever you're gonna do.
[253:55.03]Red means it goes fast.
[253:59.98]Uh, well, you got red twice in a row, so I'd be very fearful if I pressed on number 13 there.
[254:14.27]You got to go with your gut sometimes.
[254:24.36]That's not how probability works.
[254:25.63]That's the gambler's fallacy.
[254:32.94]Yeah, well...
[254:38.96]I mean, I can't argue that that is logically correct.
[254:46.90]But just in a vibes play here.
[254:50.18]Yeah, logically, it could be any one of these anytime, no matter what, in perpetuity.
[254:59.62]Alright, here we go.
[255:09.64]Uh, shoulda went red.
[255:12.41]Nope.
[255:15.10]Holy fucking shit, it actually did red three times.
[255:20.41]Gambler's fallacy.
[255:26.22]That's... That's nonsense.
[255:29.65]Again.
[255:31.76]You want me to wait?
[255:32.47]You want to do it again?
[255:32.99]You guys want to do it again?
[255:42.56]Alright, go again.
[255:50.02]I'm not doing red.
[255:52.48]You know what?
[255:53.80]Fine.
[255:55.45]No, this is the type of shit that you do at the roulette table where you're like, and then this shit pops up and you could have won like fucking a thousand dollars or something crazy.
[256:06.24]No.
[256:15.87]Alright, here we go.
[256:22.22]Roulette is also random.
[256:24.91]I know.
[256:26.19]But I'm just telling you, there's something besides just pure logic.
[256:31.33]There's the energy.
[256:33.87]There's the unseen energy.
[256:40.51]It's the vibe of the room, the atmosphere, the barometric pressure in the room.
[256:51.80]Here we go.
[257:04.93]Ah, green.
[257:17.67]Okay.
[257:19.95]I'll wait for one more bet.
[257:29.68]I went from 60K to 700K.
[257:31.91]That's crazy.
[257:36.06]Maybe you'll have something to spend your points on soon.
[257:38.22]I really want to do something interesting for those.
[257:43.07]Okay, before I never turn my stream on ever again, there will be shit for you to do with those.
[258:00.55]Here we go.
[258:09.95]A penis reveal award?
[258:17.38]Uh, no, dude.
[258:18.38]That's not happening with Channel Points.
[258:21.69]It's not happening at all, by the way.
[258:31.55]Let's go.
[258:41.57]Come on, come on!
[258:42.96]Come on, white, get in there!
[258:44.17]Red, red, red, red, green, red.
[258:56.59]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[259:06.97]You get exhausted from winning so much that you just don't want to play when I bet on you?
[259:15.25]I'm doing that again.
[259:23.52]It's going to be white.
[259:24.15]Watch.
[259:26.42]No, it's yellow.
[259:30.32]Booey.
[259:36.08]This is where you just bet 10 cents on every single one.
[259:42.90]So you win 50 cents and you go, yay, look at that.
[259:55.27]it is no green's gonna win again
[260:10.06]Come on, red.
[260:17.65]Come on, it's always red.
[260:19.75]No!
[260:20.35]Loser.
[260:36.58]And it's gonna be white.
[260:37.86]And this is where I get up from the table and I go, and I can't believe it.
[260:40.80]I bet, I bet five fucking hundred bucks.
[260:44.76]on double zero every single time they spun it, and I chose red.
[260:48.61]You told me to pick red.
[260:50.10]And I pointed to whoever I'm with.
[260:52.24]You said put it on red.
[260:55.98]¶¶
[261:06.92]What the fuck?
[261:08.17]Okay, I'll take it.
[261:09.08]I don't know how that happened, but yeah, I'll take it.
[261:15.13]Alright, I got my two coins.
[261:16.24]I can get my taffy.
[261:18.97]Pickaxe?
[261:19.43]Nope.
[261:23.94]I need a token.
[261:32.28]kind of flavor.
[261:34.83]saltwater taffy I mean that's not saltwater taffy I've no no no no no that's not saltwater taffy
[261:43.62]So I wanted to have it didn't come on a stick like this.
[261:46.12]Softwater Taffy's in a wrapper.
[261:51.16]And it's wrapped up and it's circular.
[261:53.79]That's not Softwater Taffy.
[261:55.21]Okay.
[261:57.28]What the hell was the point of getting this?
[262:07.21]This looks just like the insignia I saw on the train.
[262:09.92]I'll bet this was Jake's trunk.
[262:12.91]If this was his trunk, maybe the pickaxe and lamp that I need are inside.
[262:18.37]Mm.
[262:19.87]You ain't touching anything over there, are you, missus?
[262:22.66]Oops.
[262:23.24]I'd better go ask permission before I mess with this.
[262:25.79]I just was over there.
[262:27.06]You didn't have anything to say.
[262:34.46]Wait, can I play with this thing?
[262:35.47]I love those things.
[262:36.47]It's the thing that turns the penny into a crushed penny.
[262:40.91]Do you know what's in that old trunk over there?
[262:42.84]What?
[262:44.11]You ain't been fooling with it, have you?
[262:46.01]Oh no, of course not.
[262:47.90]No, I just thought it might contain the lamp and pickaxe that I asked you about before.
[262:51.78]Well, if it does, you can forget about them, because it's locked.
[262:56.00]None of my kin have ever been able to figure out how to open it.
[262:58.41]I have the key.
[263:06.71]These adventures would go so much quicker if Nancy just had a gun.
[263:11.57]I mean quicker, maybe?
[263:14.96]Correct?
[263:16.39]Probably not.
[263:19.06]Unless...
[263:20.04]Unless... Tell you what.
[263:22.62]You get Charlene and Purcell to come in here so as I can shake her hand, and I'll let you fiddle with that trunk till the
[263:28.14]Alright, we're going to get Charlene to come out here.
[263:31.55]But Charlina is very busy.
[263:33.62]What if she won't come?
[263:34.90]Then I guess you'll just be out of luck.
[263:37.88]No, actually, you will be.
[263:40.50]Now how do you figure that?
[263:42.49]Well, if you were to just meet her, you'd have nothing to show for it.
[263:46.55]Afterwards, she'd go her way, and you'd go yours, and that would be it.
[263:51.05]But if you were to, say, get her autograph, well, then you'd have something to hang on the wall and brag about.
[263:56.54]Okay, make it so I can meet her and get her autograph.
[264:01.82]Oh, but the thing is, she's on a deadline, and if you take her away from her writing, she may fall behind.
[264:06.53]How about, like, this is part of an active investigation for missing persons case.
[264:13.01]Do you really want to risk ruining Charlena Purcell's career?
[264:16.62]Good heavens, of course not!
[264:18.65]Alright, you just get me Charlene as Autograph, and you got it beat.
[264:23.11]Make sure she uses my name, I want it real personal-like.
[264:26.55]You bet.
[264:27.47]And your name is...?
[264:29.04]Fatima.
[264:29.74]With an F. None of that weird old PH stuff.
[264:32.67]Okay, Fatima.
[264:34.55]I'll be right back.
[264:38.01]not yet well get a move on I got where I'm gonna hang it all figured out and everything
[264:50.93]Well, I guess we're gonna go get the autograph.
[264:58.50]She's gonna want taffy or something, right?
[265:06.27]you
[265:11.60]Oh, that's the place to go.
[265:13.67]Wouldn't you look at that?
[265:15.18]Hi.
[265:17.41]I met a huge fan of yours in town who'd really, really like your autograph.
[265:21.66]An autographed picture would be even better.
[265:23.97]Imagine that, me having fans way out here in the boonies.
[265:28.15]Well, I'm sure I have a picture around here somewhere.
[265:30.52]I got a pencil.
[265:31.86]I got a writing pencil.
[265:36.02]Oh, come on.
[265:39.89]See if you can borrow a pen from somebody.
[265:42.75]Oh my fucking god.
[265:44.26]Borrow a pen.
[265:55.87]I've gotta borrow a pen.
[266:00.31]This is riveting detective work.
[266:02.70]This is the kind of shit that you just...
[266:04.86]I shouldn't be doing this.
[266:08.67]Can I borrow a pen?
[266:10.67]I really, really need a pen.
[266:13.96]Could I borrow one from you?
[266:15.12]Sorry.
[266:16.14]Thanks for the chat.
[266:18.59]Come back anytime.
[266:20.10]Gimme a break, dude.
[266:22.70]All this technology, but not a single writing utensil.
[266:33.43]What's going on?
[266:34.56]Do you by any chance have a pen I could borrow?
[266:36.99]Why, I'm surprised at you.
[266:38.82]Don't you know that every detective should carry a pen?
[266:42.09]Actually, I carry a pencil.
[266:44.16]Leaping lizards?
[266:49.41]Okay.
[266:58.47]okay the object of the game is to get rid of as many lizards as you can by jumping them with other lizards until you can't jump anymore
[267:05.58]Last time I played, I wound up with just five lizards.
[267:08.97]If you can wind up with only four, the pin's yours.
[267:31.03]Okay.
[267:50.60]I think I already fucked it up.
[268:16.67]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[268:18.01]This would be one, two, three...
[268:27.83]You lost.
[268:29.07]Guess you're not so smart after all.
[268:30.86]I've never played the first time I've ever played the game before.
[268:34.35]I don't know anything about this.
[268:37.90]Sorry, guys, my copy of Leaping Lizards is in the shop.
[268:40.82]It needed to be repaired.
[268:41.76]One of the plastic pieces broke off the bottom.
[269:14.13]Just follow the pattern you learned as a kid.
[269:15.78]I've never played this game.
[269:18.96]Just relax.
[269:20.65]I got it right now.
[269:22.02]This is it.
[269:23.32]It's a big start.
[269:23.99]Yeah.
[269:53.38]Ugh.
[270:05.94]so quiet, but you understand why, right?
[270:08.49]You understand.
[270:36.73]Okay.
[270:46.86]Uh, I need to have four left.
[270:50.36]So one, this is almost impossible for me to fuck this up, right?
[271:08.02]I'm afraid to do anything.
[271:12.40]Dude, I'm afraid to do anything.
[271:13.87]I'm afraid to do anything.
[271:15.89]I'm afraid.
[271:17.72]I only have a few moves.
[271:19.31]I don't know.
[271:20.03]I don't know what to do.
[271:21.36]I don't know.
[271:21.78]I'm afraid.
[271:22.26]See, Drew's freaking out.
[271:25.31]I'm afraid.
[271:28.61]If I put this here, then...
[271:30.16]Wait.
[271:43.66]Yeah!
[271:44.83]I did it!
[271:45.57]I won!
[271:46.22]Talk about luck.
[271:48.39]Here's your pin.
[271:53.06]Nothing.
[271:54.17]Why are you so mad?
[272:01.20]I'm not mad.
[272:02.10]I'm just...
[272:04.06]Just vibing.
[272:18.07]He's mad at us.
[272:19.17]No, I'm not!
[272:21.22]What'd you guys do?
[272:22.19]You guys didn't do anything.
[272:23.95]Except for that one guy.
[272:25.98]And whoa, he is gone, gone, permanently gone.
[272:30.64]Whoa, don't be like that guy.
[272:32.07]Yikes.
[272:39.52]Oh wait, no, I don't...
[272:40.87]I don't...
[272:41.15]This guy doesn't want a pen.
[272:42.30]I have to get it...
[272:43.20]Okay, wait.
[272:48.22]Have you found a pen so I can autograph that picture?
[272:50.82]I got it from Tino.
[272:52.04]You can keep it.
[272:53.19]If you could have it say, To Fatima, that'd be great.
[273:00.70]There you go.
[273:01.28]Anything else?
[273:04.70]Thank you.
[273:06.27]That would be nice.
[273:09.71]Yeah, why is the sound effects in this game and some of the dialog five times louder, even if you put the whatever?
[273:19.87]I'm just checking.
[273:25.78]Uh oh.
[273:30.11]There you are.
[273:30.75]We've been looking for you.
[273:31.80]See what I'm saying?
[273:32.22]Yeah, you won't believe the lucky break we caught.
[273:34.19]Lucky break?
[273:34.99]Hey, that was the result of good old-fashioned detective work.
[273:37.77]It was the result of your insisting we stop for a cheeseburger.
[273:41.65]Guys, what's going on?
[273:43.38]That sounds kind of good.
[273:44.16]It turns out that a grandchild of Jake's engineer still lives around here.
[273:47.51]What's more, he hangs out at the local diner.
[273:49.26]Now they're quiet.
[273:53.99]Okay, so you found that out?
[273:55.68]I found that out when you stopped there so Joe could get a hamburger.
[273:59.40]The thing is, the owner of the diner wouldn't agree to point the guy out unless one of us fills in for his short order cook.
[274:05.67]He's got to go home and wait for the cable guy or something.
[274:07.74]And since Joe here barely knows how to boil water, guess who got the job?
[274:14.07]Way to go, Joe.
[274:15.33]Hey, I can boil water.
[274:17.12]It's just that when it's got things floating in it, I get confused.
[274:20.77]Speaking of confused, get this.
[274:22.89]Balducci convinced Laurie that Jake's mine is somewhere right here in Copper Gorge, so he, Laurie, and John Gray are hiking up the mountain out there even as we speak.
[274:30.49]Like that bumble brain's gonna find anything.
[274:33.05]Sounds like now might be a good time to do some serious poking around on the train.
[274:36.44]Now I can actually do the piano.
[274:38.03]I can actually do the jam.
[274:39.83]Wish me luck.
[274:40.46]I'll go with you.
[274:41.16]You can make me a cheeseburger.
[274:46.89]Well, that's sure interesting.
[274:50.67]All that stuff you just said?
[274:52.11]Oh, looks like
[274:55.83]Funny.
[274:57.30]My name was something.
[274:58.42]Got that autograph?
[274:59.91]Got something better.
[275:01.07]I got a mystery to solve.
[275:03.13]Hot dang!
[275:04.66]She spelled my name right and everything.
[275:07.77]Go ahead, little missy.
[275:09.03]Have a go at that trunk.
[275:10.56]Whatever's inside it's all yours.
[275:12.94]I hope it's so much gold.
[275:15.68]I hope it's money in there, dude.
[275:22.23]Yep.
[275:23.11]Uh, what?
[275:36.33]Is it a different combination?
[275:38.55]Oh God.
[275:39.15]Okay.
[275:39.51]It's a different combination.
[275:44.03]Well, I...
[275:45.17]Okay, I... Let me go... Taffy Kitchen employees only...
[275:52.63]Can I go in there?
[275:54.44]Will he let me in there?
[275:56.71]Welcome back.
[275:58.02]It was fun talking to you.
[275:59.38]I'll bet it was.
[276:05.39]Taffy wins the bet.

[277:47.55]Okay, there it is.
[277:52.56]Thank you.
[277:55.89]Why even have the camera?
[277:57.80]It's fucking useless.
[278:01.09]Okay, so it's C... What the hell do I need to play?

[279:26.63]Oops.

[280:48.23]Still have to do that.
[280:50.22]Haven't done that yet.
[280:51.41]I got the spyglass, though.
[280:53.39]Can't check that off yet.
[280:54.92]Let me go to the room with the spyglass.
[281:00.96]Yes.
[281:05.82]Alright, stick it in here.
[281:14.04]Shit.
[281:16.45]Okay, I can't use that.
[281:19.01]Can I put this in something?
[281:25.22]Tube or something?
[281:42.03]Huh.
[281:42.86]Whoa, what is that?
[281:43.90]Okay, that's where a gemstone goes.
[281:53.37]Somebody said MonkaS.
[281:54.36]Why are you MonkaSing?
[281:59.70]Okay, that's a whole nother puzzle for a whole nother day.
[282:03.07]There we go.
[282:06.07]Okay, I need the lamp.
[282:09.93]I gotta get in that chest.
[282:17.15]Alright.
[282:17.73]I gotta get to the cemetery.
[282:18.92]I gotta...
[282:19.32]There's a lot of things I gotta do.
[282:20.41]Okay.
[282:22.55]Scary music.
[282:33.15]Why is there scary music?
[282:54.51]More questions?
[282:55.96]You good?
[282:56.36]You didn't go on Tino's expedition to Jake's mine?
[282:59.35]Please.
[283:00.08]the man barely knows where his head is if he's the one who finds that mine I'll eat my laptop granny boss fight going alright then
[283:12.53]Alright, let me go to the cemetery if it's even here.
[283:22.78]This still doesn't do anything.
[283:24.28]She just goes, look out!
[283:26.56]Uh-oh, that doesn't look good.
[283:35.89]cemetery yes you startled me do you work here I do are you looking for someone
[283:44.14]Yes, Camille Hurley.
[283:45.91]She died back in the 1800s.
[283:47.60]Ah, Camille.
[283:49.88]Beautiful crypt.
[283:51.20]Wonderful view.
[283:52.23]Go bring me some taffy.
[283:53.64]Whoever buried her must have loved her very much.
[283:57.37]May I go inside it?
[283:58.67]you may but unfortunately you can't why not I accidentally dropped the key down the grate that's in front of the crypt
[284:07.56]If you can retrieve it, you can keep it.
[284:10.47]I'm having a battle on me.
[284:12.64]If you do go into the crypt, just remember, you won't be alone.
[284:17.55]you
[284:22.65]Ooh.
[284:33.97]Oh, no.
[284:36.99]Oh, no.
[284:45.97]Yep.
[284:57.68]That does not look fun.
[284:59.96]That might be a next stream kind of a scenario I think.
[285:03.94]That could be like in a day or two.
[285:06.31]You know what I mean?
[285:08.28]I'm just telling you, yeah.
[285:10.23]100%.
[285:11.43]P.B.,
[285:14.29]PB.
[285:23.70]See you.
[285:29.53]See you.
[285:33.79]See you.
[285:35.14]Okay, so this is the periodic table.
[285:42.00]See you.
[285:48.05]Why can I only click on PB and see you?
[286:02.06]See you next stream.
[286:05.37]See you.
[286:08.74]You know, you could be pretty, that could be accurate.
[286:11.24]Yeah.
[286:14.23]I'll give it like another 50.
[286:14.99]We'll get it to five hours.
[286:15.91]I'll do five hours.
[286:18.06]We'll get it to an even number there.
[286:20.45]Or an odd number, but an even placement.
[286:22.29]okay uh this is the combination for the chest so I need the periodic tables to look at I'll do this first
[286:34.21]In the letter he wrote to his niece, Jake said she should go to Camille's grave and let Camille's goodness rub off on her.
[286:40.75]Rub as in rubbing maybe?
[286:42.66]If I am supposed to make rubbings of these pillars, I'll need a pencil, which I already have.
[286:47.76]Do I have paper?
[286:48.12]It's a nice thin paper.
[286:50.35]I need something that'll help me make sense out of all those lines.
[286:54.61]Do I got paper here?
[286:55.50]Maybe making a rubbing would help.
[287:00.73]So use this stupid fucking piece of paper.
[287:03.35]What do you mean?
[287:04.01]I got plenty of paper.
[287:14.13]I gotta get a rubbing.
[287:20.14]Alright, I got those screenshotted.
[287:23.77]I'm gonna put this away and I'm gonna head backwards Because I want to go look at the periodic table
[287:39.82]About two thirds of the way through.
[287:41.10]That checks out.
[287:43.55]That means it's probably like another couple hours, like another like hour or two.
[287:48.44]More questions?
[287:49.61]You got paper?
[287:50.09]Well I'll let you go.
[287:50.96]Let me know if you run across anything juicy.
[288:01.90]For you, it'd be about five hours.
[288:03.27]I mean, we're about...
[288:04.84]There's only like another hour or two left in the game.
[288:07.02]Hmm.
[288:10.17]Hmm.
[288:11.99]Maybe I just lock in and just do it.
[288:15.28]Yeah, we're locking in.
[288:16.26]I'm gonna finish it today.
[288:18.59]This is a lock-in scenario.
[288:22.20]Because I think this is realistically probably like an hour or two.
[288:27.34]Maybe if I'm good and I get these puzzles smoked out.
[288:34.91]Alright, let's put it this way.
[288:36.56]If I am not at like the end of the game in like 30 minutes, then we'll finish it in the next narrative.
[288:48.56]Okay, I need to go look at the periodic table.
[289:01.39]Okay, we got ZN was zinc.
[289:11.21]I got to write this shit down.
[289:12.59]Alright.
[289:12.93]Zinc 30.
[289:19.95]So we got ZN is zinc and it's number 30.
[289:29.55]Then PB is led to number 82.
[289:40.67]Number 82.
[289:41.50]And I and I is nickel.
[289:55.12]And that's number 28.
[290:00.48]Fe is iron.
[290:08.91]Which element am I, senpai?
[290:14.07]Fucking palladium.
[290:18.49]Uh, alright.
[290:19.78]Well, where am I?
[290:20.93]Fe is iron.
[290:24.51]It's number 26.
[290:27.37]Excellent.
[290:29.24]AG is silver.
[290:33.59]which we already should know that one, right?
[290:37.95]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[290:38.66]That one's orange, blue, green.
[290:40.93]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[290:41.93]So that one silver was the way to open this one.
[290:46.29]So which is the one to open that one?
[290:49.90]Because that AG one listed is, in the screenshot, it's orange, blue, green, red, purple, yellow.
[291:00.00]So lead is the key.
[291:01.39]Oh, it is the key.
[291:03.09]Lead is the key.
[291:04.30]I don't have to write this shit down.
[291:06.75]I'm good.
[291:07.47]Let's go.
[291:11.44]That's right.
[291:12.41]Lead is the key.
[291:15.51]We got PB, which is lead.
[291:17.08]PB.
[291:17.68]Let's go.
[291:18.16]I'm opening that shit right now.
[291:29.67]They let you graduate without memorizing the periodic table,
[291:35.83]Dude, the only thing I know about the periodic table these days is a Star Wars shirt I have, where every Star Wars character is a slot on the periodic table.
[291:46.12]You think I'm messing around?
[291:47.23]Go watch a video from like 2017.
[291:49.08]I've worn it on stream.
[292:02.00]Back when Star Wars, I felt okay saying I liked it.
[292:08.27]That's so crazy.
[292:12.31]That's crazy.
[292:14.78]Dude, back in the early 2000s, after hearing that we were going to get more Star Wars, I was like, that's crazy.
[292:20.94]The monkey paw just curled, man.
[292:22.90]It was crazy.
[292:24.11]It was crazy.
[292:25.98]Okay.
[292:26.94]PB wig of red.
[292:30.30]Green.
[292:34.94]Blue.
[292:35.32]Orange.
[292:42.60]Yellow, purple.
[292:48.32]Bingo.
[292:49.79]Lamp.
[292:52.69]And a big coin.
[292:54.59]Hell yeah.
[293:02.36]Welcome back.
[293:03.81]Have you by any chance ever come across a pickaxe that had the initials J.H.
[293:07.64]carved into it?
[293:08.46]Why?
[293:08.98]Because it used to belong to Jake Hurley, and I really, really need it.
[293:12.35]Cousin Alvin.
[293:18.92]He thinks he's so smart.
[293:21.33]As for that pickaxe, so happens I got it upstairs in my kitchen.
[293:24.93]Use it to open the coconuts Aunt Lucy sends me every year from Hawaii.
[293:28.64]Do you think I could have it?
[293:30.02]Why, no, you can't have it.
[293:32.33]How would I open them coconuts?
[293:35.66]This character sucks.
[293:43.56]Hey, I could have just gotten you Charlene's autograph, but instead I got you an autographed picture, which is way better.
[293:50.25]You owe me.
[293:51.15]I don't want to play leaping lizards if you go in there.
[294:00.57]Sure.
[294:01.83]I got a bunch of taffy over there what needs sorting.
[294:04.79]Just follow the directions that are posted by the machine.
[294:07.42]Shit.
[294:15.38]Okay, well, I did want to play with the Tappy Machine.
[294:24.44]Can I not?
[294:25.04]Wait, what?
[294:31.78]Um, huh?
[294:43.68]Oh, it's the employee.
[294:44.71]Okay.
[294:45.99]Alright.
[294:46.49]We got Apple banana.

[294:50.80]Wax paper for the taffy.
[294:52.65]Would you mind if I took a piece of wax paper?
[294:54.86]Guess I could let you have a piece.
[294:57.07]Perfect.
[294:59.83]Can rub the pencil on that.
[295:01.03]Alright, so we got...

[295:20.99]Okay, I can only, I can't, I have to get rid of these.
[295:23.86]How do I say reject?
[295:25.47]Oh, I have to sort it.

[296:39.24]I bet you on senior that's a little bit faster.
[296:43.58]But isn't it interesting that as a senior,
[296:45.92]I'm playing on the junior difficulty.
[296:49.42]We like to have fun here in the nursing home.
[296:52.15]Got that taffy sorted?
[296:54.80]No, I did not.
[297:02.23]Well, ain't you the goody two-shoes.
[297:05.05]Truth is, wouldn't have minded too much if you had.
[297:07.80]Long as he fessed up to it.
[297:09.15]Here's the pickaxe.
[297:10.51]I do.
[297:11.17]I won't.
[297:18.37]Thank you.
[297:22.34]I haven't saved in like three hours.
[297:28.79]Okay.
[297:30.59]Now I got pretty much all the tools now to turn on the machine.
[297:34.47]I have new coins as well.
[297:36.82]Alright, so I'm ready to get out of here.
[297:40.50]Oops, sounds like somebody's taking a nap.
[297:50.18]Alright, Nancy, get out of here.
[297:56.51]Hello?
[297:57.02]Hey, it's Frank.
[297:58.22]What's up, Frank?
[297:58.77]I'm in the kitchen of the diner playing short order cook.
[298:01.64]Has that grandchild of...
[298:03.95]Hey, I was doing taffy stuff.
[298:06.90]And get this.
[298:07.87]He's a retired miner, so every time I finish an order and ring the pickup bell, he thinks it's the mineshaft elevator bell.
[298:13.72]and for some reason it makes him start telling his lady friend about his grandfather.
[298:19.82]Dude, I want one of these so bad.
[298:26.43]I just fill an order, ring the bell, and ding, he picks up right where he left off.
[298:31.37]That is, unless I fill the order wrong and the waitress chews me out.
[298:35.04]Okay, so am I going to be cooking food in a minute?
[298:42.51]I am.
[298:43.20]Just wanted to keep you posted.
[298:44.65]Well, good luck.
[298:45.54]Thanks.
[298:46.09]Talk to you soon.
[298:50.53]Wait, am I- is this a character switch?
[298:56.42]Volcano Burger.
[298:57.83]Onions, jalapeños, hot mustard, bacon, and cheese.
[299:00.64]Onions, jalapeños, hot mustard, bacon, and cheese.
[299:07.00]Which one of these is a fucking onion?
[299:08.87]Okay, it is your onion.
[299:12.03]Onion, jalapeño, hot mustard, bacon.
[299:15.44]Where's the jalapeños?
[299:17.62]That's pickles, man.
[300:22.30]I fucking quit.
[300:23.56]Alright, alright, here we go.
[300:31.21]I just... Oh, wee, Rick!
[300:41.31]Oh, Rick, it's me, Mr. Poopy Butthole.
[300:49.26]Oh, what the fuck?
[300:50.65]Okay.
[300:51.01]Alright.
[300:51.28]What do you want?
[300:51.80]You want onions, jalapeño, hot mustard.
[301:03.62]Bacon and cheese.
[301:04.71]Alright, here you go.
[301:11.39]Another order we got.
[301:13.97]lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup let's turn it on
[301:21.56]Pickled mayo ketchup.
[301:23.53]Wait.
[301:30.13]Told my daddy that men don't come any crazier than Jake Hurley, or any nicer.
[301:35.01]Totem stuff.
[301:40.34]I've got a tomato fruit jelly.
[301:50.59]Camille was her name.
[301:52.29]Camille Boulet.
[301:53.90]That's French, you know.
[301:55.46]Pineapple cheese, man.
[302:04.69]She didn't take well to the heat sea, and sometimes in the summer, when they were going through the desert,
[302:09.70]Colossal, but everything minus the peas.
[302:14.76]You don't want pickles, peanut butter, pineapple, or pickled herring.
[302:17.97]Everything but anything with a P. Lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese.
[302:27.96]an avocado jelly
[302:35.24]jalapeños mustard ketchup mayo hot mustard
[302:42.68]And bacon.
[302:43.82]Chef's choice.
[302:53.21]Fuck you, you're getting it fucking plain.
[302:58.20]Oh, wait.
[302:59.83]Hold on.
[303:00.11]...which tell Granddad the secret to finding his mind.
[303:02.77]He made him swear to tell it to my daddy and nobody else.
[303:06.51]Eventually, my daddy.
[303:07.87]He told me.
[303:08.51]And it was so bizarre that I remember it to this day.
[303:11.97]Though I sure don't understand how it'd help anybody find his mind.
[303:15.91]But since my daddy didn't tell me not to tell anybody, this is what Crazy Jake Hurley told Granddad, word for word.
[303:24.12]The eye of the tiger is fixed on a star.
[303:27.88]Take a picture.
[303:30.47]Amethyst floats in a hand from the deep.
[303:34.21]Citrine is what the foul mouth shall keep.
[303:37.65]Tourmaline by a soft arm is ensnared.
[303:40.96]Peridot rests at the foot of the mare.
[303:44.68]The eye of the tiger is fixed on a star Zircon lies in fingers that scar
[303:50.25]Amethyst floats in a hand from the deep.
[303:53.40]Citrine is what the foul mouth shall keep.
[303:56.47]Tourmaline by a soft arm is ensnared.
[303:59.16]I got a black tourmaline bracelet.
[304:01.07]Gives me superpowers.
[304:02.15]Frank, are you sure that's what he said?
[304:04.56]I'm positive.
[304:07.15]Do you think he could have been pulling your leg?
[304:09.00]Look, this guy was old, okay?
[304:11.73]I mean, we're talking Jurassic.
[304:13.89]And guys that old don't joke around.
[304:15.74]They don't have time to.
[304:17.14]what you just heard is what I heard word for word got anything else I almost forgot you gotta check this out it's just an old letter Frank you bet it's an old letter
[304:27.13]From Samuel Clemens.
[304:29.21]Oh, my gosh.
[304:30.51]Where did you get this?
[304:31.82]I found it in the caboose.
[304:33.03]Apparently, he and Jake were pen pals.
[304:35.44]Holy shit, Samuel Clemens.
[304:37.89]Who's that again?
[304:44.25]When Joe gave it to me, I about flipped.
[304:46.76]I know I should turn it over to Lori, and I will, but it's just so darn cool.
[304:50.51]I still don't see what the big deal is.
[304:51.91]That's Mark Twain.
[304:52.33]It's not like it's from Mark Twain or anything.
[304:54.26]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[304:55.65]Yeah, that's right.
[304:56.29]That is Mark Twain.
[304:57.39]I thought it was supposed to be somebody in the game.
[304:59.70]Okay, if somebody said, oh, well, our buddy that runs the train, Mark Twain.
[305:03.16]Fuck, that's actually not, that's never going to happen.
[305:06.94]Like, oh, we never understand who we found a letter from.
[305:10.43]Oh, Ghost Guy John's
[305:13.41]a friend, Mark Twain, and be like, fuck, that would be Mark Twain.
[305:16.95]I guess there could be more than one Mark Twain.
[305:21.65]See you soon.
[305:22.31]Sounds good.
[305:27.28]Okay.
[305:31.34]Where are we at?
[305:34.60]Use that diagram to position the spyglass lamp and pickaxe on Jake's projector.
[305:39.36]I haven't done that yet.
[305:40.70]I'm done with that.
[305:42.59]Check.
[305:44.32]Okay.
[305:46.65]Ditto the pattern labeled... Coup.
[305:51.48]What do you mean, Ditto?
[305:55.58]Okay, we're gonna go back to the crypt finish that oh
[306:05.75]Gulp gulp!
[306:15.76]Open the old trunk.
[306:25.68]Okay, go to the cemetery.
[306:26.91]I think I'm pretty much there.
[306:29.06]Got all the items.
[306:36.92]I got all the coins.
[306:42.08]Got the piano.
[306:45.17]Okay.
[306:47.23]still have to do that alright so let's go let's do the money I got money
[306:52.58]Is this a 100% walkthrough of Nancy Drew?
[306:54.93]This is a, uh, any percent walkthrough.
[307:14.82]Because I got a ton of money now.
[307:15.97]Okay.
[307:20.40]We're trying to get to the eagle.
[307:50.83]What's going on here?
[307:54.14]You still don't know how this works.
[307:55.59]I mean, I know it's weight.
[307:56.61]I know this is...
[307:58.39]Okay, like one and...
[308:00.84]three because this is it's this is two this is minus this is positive
[308:06.19]But do I- do I- Oh, I gotta go to the eagle!
[308:08.16]I gotta- I gotta- I gotta- I gotta- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[308:10.33]Anybody get a screenshot?
[308:12.50]Anybody get a screenshot of that, um, that, like, placemat thing that's on the wall?
[308:19.77]The thing that had all the numbers with the corresponding animals.
[308:32.72]Hey, let me just post that image in chat really quick.
[308:35.12]I actually think I took a picture of it.
[308:36.31]Let me see.
[308:39.54]Did I take a picture of that?
[308:45.15]Hold on.
[308:46.84]Why did I look this up?
[308:52.26]Okay.
[308:53.33]Alright.
[308:54.39]I typed into Google at some point.
[308:55.88]When was this?
[308:59.11]This is like almost a year ago.
[309:00.54]Does pool shock remove diarrhea?
[309:05.61]No, pool shock itself doesn't directly remove diarrhea.
[309:09.08]Pool shock, which is usually calcium hypochlorite,
[309:12.46]It is a strong oxidizer used to kill bacteria and algae in a pool, not to treat diarrhea.
[309:17.87]diarrhea is a symptom and pool shock is a pool treatment.
[309:23.44]That's why I screenshotted it, man.
[309:25.46]That's why I took that picture.
[309:26.95]Because that's a fucking unbelievable response.
[309:36.76]It thought I was asking if Pulisic would treat diarrhea.
[309:40.22]That's not what I was asking.
[309:43.07]I was saying if somebody died in a pool and you put a bunch of shock in it, is it fine?
[309:54.81]I don't have a picture of this thing
[310:02.54]Because I got to get to the number for the eagle.
[310:05.98]Does anyone remember what the number was?
[310:13.22]You pooped in a pool.
[310:14.11]No, I was just thinking like, wait, if somebody were to like, like when people puke or shit or piss in a pool.
[310:21.31]I think we actually had this conversation, guys.
[310:24.62]And I asked you guys, hey, if somebody puked in a pool, does shock clear it?
[310:29.33]And I think everyone was like, well...
[310:30.88]So I looked it up and then I got a great, uh, automatic Google response to it.
[310:38.75]Alright.
[310:39.09]What's that Eagle?
[310:41.49]There you go, VRJosh, you got it.
[310:44.01]Alright, the eagle is nine.
[310:50.43]Okay, no, but that's like a dove.
[310:52.03]The eagle is two.
[311:00.22]So this whole thing has to equal two.
[311:19.95]Bingo.
[311:31.27]No, the question that I was posing to Google was, if somebody were to have diarrhea in a pool,
[311:39.74]And you dumped pool shock into the pool.
[311:43.88]How does it remove the diarrhea?
[311:47.11]Like, how does that, how do you handle that if you have a pool?
[311:58.81]Do you just have to wait till the filter clears it and then you shock the hell out of it and wait like a day?
[312:03.25]You'd have to drain the pool.
[312:05.34]You would have to drain the pool?
[312:06.75]No, you definitely would not.
[312:10.49]You know how people puke in pools and they probably just go, everybody out for a minute, we're gonna scoop it up and shock the fuck out of it.
[312:16.63]That's how it works.
[312:17.27]You have to drain the whole pool.
[312:18.98]I don't think that's accurate.
[312:25.54]Okay, where's that eagle?
[312:29.86]Right here.
[312:33.81]More pipes.
[312:35.21]Why am I not surprised?
[313:03.24]This sucks.
[313:04.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[313:05.46]I almost got it.
[313:46.98]Fuck.
[314:05.36]This is fucked up.
[314:18.67]Okay.
[314:20.18]It's so close.
[314:26.31]It is so close.
[314:30.40]Dude, which, where is it?
[314:34.64]It is so unbelievably close.
[314:49.47]How does this work?
[314:53.72]There, that looks right.
[314:56.05]Yes, wowee.
[314:58.66]Wowee.
[314:59.33]Okay, can I now turn the valve on?
[315:10.21]Apparently not.
[315:14.00]Okay.
[315:18.75]So what else can I activate with the coins?
[315:33.19]Yeah, there's more, there's definitely, there's another pipe puzzle.
[315:35.66]Nancy Drew did this thing where they would make one puzzle and then it would appear five times in the game.
[315:45.24]Nothing else to do with you, okay.
[315:51.61]What else is even here?
[315:54.98]I don't know.
[315:55.56]Like, what is that one?
[315:59.31]What is that even on the list?
[316:02.14]Is that a chest piece?
[316:10.99]I don't know what it is.
[316:15.12]A bell?
[316:18.03]Is there a bell even on this placemat thing?
[316:20.96]There is.
[316:21.58]What number is the bell?
[316:23.61]In the screenshot, the bell is cut off.
[316:27.82]But I can do the key.
[316:28.85]The key is 20.
[316:53.13]hmm hmm
[317:03.37]Oh I need to do the wax paper.
[317:08.87]I'm also going to take a break.
[317:10.96]Probably the last break in the night.
[317:12.68]I'm going to... Alright, let's do a check.
[317:17.42]Where am I in the game?
[317:20.38]How much time is left?
[317:21.37]Am I almost there?
[317:26.94]How we doing?
[317:30.94]A little bit more than two thirds now.
[317:34.80]You're about like 83% done.
[317:38.91]Okay.
[317:42.94]Maybe 30 minutes left if you really struggle.
[317:45.75]Okay.
[317:46.83]Alright, I'll finish it.
[317:48.44]Just give me like five minutes.
[317:49.88]I can't mute the mic.
[317:51.23]I can't do anything besides just leave.
[317:52.93]But I'll be back in like three-ish minutes.
[317:57.83]I can pull up the phone and do the BRB.
[317:59.71]This is BRB.
[318:00.25]Be right back.
[327:53.50]You better not be getting yourself into any trouble.
[327:57.85]You better not be fucking around.
[328:06.32]kind of not alright the bell is 12 apparently that's good
[328:16.21]Why were you gone for like 20 minutes?
[328:18.42]Because I felt like it.
[328:22.91]No.
[328:26.29]Where's the real Jerma?
[328:29.20]That's me.
[328:29.58]Where's Artemis?
[328:32.43]Hi, everybody.
[328:35.00]Okay.
[328:40.33]What am I doing?
[328:41.87]What am I doing?
[328:42.28]What am I doing?
[328:42.68]Where am I going?
[328:44.19]Uh, the bell is 12.
[328:45.18]I'm gonna do 12.
[328:46.12]I think I can do 12.
[328:53.37]Get the gem in the chandelier.
[328:55.20]Huh?
[329:01.07]There's a gem in the chandelier?
[329:05.55]What are you smoking?
[329:11.55]Alright, we need 12.
[329:29.50]okay uh swap you swap you swap you swap you
[329:38.14]You go over here, you head over there, you go that way,
[329:43.35]You come over here.
[329:44.62]You go over there.
[329:46.10]You come down.
[329:47.77]You come down.
[329:48.65]Oh, shoot.
[329:50.38]Do you have to use them all?
[330:01.73]There is actually a gem in the chandelier.
[330:07.95]You probably do have to use them all.
[330:09.02]Alright, so wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[330:14.93]Ten has to go over here.
[330:29.98]Shit.
[330:31.63]Wait, 12 is the eagle?
[330:34.47]Hold on a second, wait.
[330:35.27]Did I get this wrong?
[330:41.27]Five coins that equal 12 for the bell.
[330:43.33]The arrow goes up one time you put a coin on.
[330:50.92]Oh, oh, oh boy.
[330:57.33]That's interesting.
[331:01.43]Okay, so it has to... Oh...
[331:06.56]He ever smoked concentrated THC?
[331:09.52]Bro, we're playing Nancy Drew right now.
[331:11.57]This is not the time to ask me these kinds of drug-related questions.
[331:27.52]Shit.
[331:35.60]Fuck.
[331:41.31]Fuck.
[331:46.21]This has got to be... Oh, fuck.
[331:48.52]Hold on.
[331:51.64]Oh, math.
[331:58.98]What's going on here?
[332:01.88]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 1.
[332:10.56]Shouldn't this be doing it?
[332:15.45]I might need more coins, but the indicator is right there.
[332:21.64]You have to use all the coins.
[332:23.09]Are you rage baiting?
[332:24.00]No, I'm going by what somebody said.
[332:34.67]Somebody said, hey, the indicator is landing on it when there's a certain amount of coins, which look at that, that makes total sense to me.

[336:42.29]Alright, so when that chandelier was shaking... Is that what you guys are talking about?
[336:47.63]Because I tried to click on it.
[336:51.67]But it didn't do anything.
[336:55.69]Where even is it?
[337:03.28]Also, wisdom, charity, is that like W?
[337:15.37]No, L. No.
[337:16.56]But I mean, like, is it... Because there's a four-digit code.
[337:31.48]Chandler's the one with the Hardy Boys room.
[337:33.63]Hold on.
[337:39.12]Is it W or L?
[337:41.49]Alright, what do you guys think?
[337:42.42]Is Nancy Drew W or L?

[338:31.22]Okay.
[338:31.52]I can go...
[338:41.56]into that crazy room.
[338:43.83]I gotta put all this shit up there.
[338:54.68]Dude, remember that, um, that doll puzzle?
[338:58.23]W. I, I love that, by the way.

[339:14.98]Right?
[339:15.35]You and you get it.
[339:20.23]Okay.
[339:21.90]If I had a lamp, this is where I'd put it.
[339:24.31]Put the lamp here.
[339:25.12]Okay, looks like that goes there.
[339:29.03]There's still water in it, which means it must be out of carbide.
[339:32.20]Put the carbine in it.
[339:34.92]There, it should work now.
[339:36.51]Now I can take the pickaxe?
[339:43.65]Where does anyone want to put this shit?
[339:45.04]Oh no, I gotta put the stones.
[339:49.36]Okay, here's the stone chamber.
[339:58.67]We're going to have to look.
[339:59.89]What's the gem book?
[340:00.64]It's going to be like, oh, and the octopuses really do love reality stones.
[340:05.90]Right.
[340:15.58]What is that?
[340:26.27]And, and...
[340:31.21]Finish that.
[340:34.90]Apparently each gemstone goes in a specific holder.
[340:38.01]Yeah.
[340:39.87]What are the significance of the words of wisdom?
[340:42.94]Uh-huh.
[340:47.84]Opened up that, connect all the pipes.

[352:33.49]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[352:39.97]W W W
[352:53.58]Now what?
[352:57.09]We are the Crystal Gems.
[353:01.27]We're here to save the day.
[353:04.03]And I'm made of diamonds.
[353:07.17]And my name is Diamond.
[353:13.38]And Pearl.
[353:14.12]Massive L.
[353:25.54]You just did psychic damage.
[353:26.67]Good.
[353:27.28]I'm glad I just did psychic damage to people.
[353:37.66]This is a Nancy Drew stream, dude.
[353:39.69]You better be ready to take the psychic damage.
[353:44.03]You must be new around here.
[353:48.61]Okay.
[353:50.54]Um, I don't know the rest of the song.
[353:53.75]Because that's usually when I skip to a different show.
[354:01.08]That's why I'm graphing the changer.
[354:02.41]And if I go, we are the Crystal Gems.
[354:05.07]And I'm on a different TV show.
[354:15.88]There's a lot of sad faces.
[354:17.53]I'm kidding.
[354:18.13]I don't even, I've never seen the show.
[354:19.40]I heard it was fine.
[354:20.20]I heard it was good.
[354:20.95]What's wrong with the show?
[354:21.93]Something wrong with it?
[354:27.71]What's up?
[354:29.99]Was it too bad?
[354:34.49]It was a lovely show.
[354:36.56]I don't know anything about it.
[354:38.19]It's an anti-block box that I found in a summer monastery I scoped out on my show last year.
[354:43.20]You can open it with either the key, which I just discovered I forgot to bring with me, or the combination, which you're supposed to be able to figure out just by looking at the box.
[354:51.39]Fortunately, I didn't put anything critical in there.
[354:54.06]Will you stop hogging the healing?
[354:56.21]But if you want that duct tape, go ahead and give it a shot.
[355:00.74]Thanks, I think I will.
[355:02.61]If you get it open, the duct tape's all yours.
[355:05.38]Oh, great.
[355:14.51]I don't know.
[355:15.25]We get two of every animal.
[355:18.92]Alright, so how do I switch them?
[355:20.30]Wait, I have to click what order they're in.
[355:22.19]Alright, so we got, here's the story.
[355:26.18]The man with his peacock.
[355:31.10]The man sees...
[355:32.58]The man on beach sees Tiger.
[355:38.59]Tiger gets in boat.
[355:45.39]Man and Tiger then end up seeing Wolf.
[355:50.65]Wolf.
[355:51.44]Wait.
[355:55.90]Why the fuck is it- Wait.
[355:57.55]Hold on.
[356:01.25]Is this the beach?
[356:03.46]Okay, hold on.
[356:03.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[356:04.77]Is he going back and forth here?
[356:05.85]Hold on.
[356:06.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[356:20.74]He's taking them back and forth.
[356:25.71]Okay, this one here, he's like, yo, there's no animals at all.
[356:30.98]Or is it like, hey, I'm done carting around animals.
[356:35.91]This looks like a, hey, we all want to take a ride with you.
[356:38.46]And he's like, yo.
[356:46.27]Because they all have to make it over to the right?
[356:54.86]Okay.
[356:57.21]So then they get in the boat, paint the picture.
[357:04.92]Dude, I'm looking at it.
[357:08.82]So if it's like, hey, here we go.
[357:10.32]I've got all these animals.
[357:11.19]We're all going to go in my boat.
[357:14.69]So that means that the...
[357:18.74]This one?
[357:25.56]Cause that would be like, okay, I've got the cat in the boat now.
[357:28.22]And then like, now we're over here with the guy I've deposited the cat.
[357:37.30]Now I'm coming to get the wolf.
[357:43.91]Okay, no, no.
[357:44.41]Cat is now deposited.
[357:48.88]No, wait.
[357:49.82]What about this one?
[357:50.46]Cat's in this one.
[357:53.63]Fuck.
[357:54.01]Hold on.
[357:54.42]Wait a second.
[357:57.62]This is...
[358:03.85]Peacock eats the wolf.
[358:07.40]Cat's been deployed.
[358:08.44]Okay, I didn't know.
[358:10.59]But the cat's in the boat in this one.
[358:13.74]So it can't be this one.
[358:15.68]So he drops the cat off.
[358:18.80]Yeah, but then look, he's like going, what the fuck is the cat doing over here?
[358:27.42]Wasn't the cat over on the right?
[358:38.05]This guy's over 40 years old.
[358:39.22]Dude, if you were to explain to me this, it doesn't matter how old you are.
[358:47.91]Okay, is this water?
[358:50.24]Okay, to me, blue is water, orange is sand.
[358:55.90]And that's not the case, apparently.
[358:58.78]In what world is this not the beach and the shore?
[359:01.65]Beach and the shore.
[359:08.41]This is water.
[359:19.11]I would have added five more frames to this story.
[359:29.57]They can't eat each other.
[359:30.90]Well, I wish he would have told me, hey, make sure those animals don't eat each other.
[359:35.28]Alright, here we go.
[359:42.33]This is a classic riddle.
[359:46.72]He's rage baiting for clips.
[359:49.70]I'm not rage baiting.
[359:51.20]I'm trying to figure out this fucking puzzle from a junior game, okay?
[360:00.15]I didn't know it was about, they could, they were gonna eat each other.
[360:17.72]You can't really fault him on this one, to be honest.
[360:19.47]The wolf would also eat the bird, so it's not a clear version of the classic.
[360:23.01]Oh, thank you so much.
[360:32.62]So what?
[360:33.16]So they have to not eat each other.
[360:36.27]So is it implied that these two are going to eat the bird?
[360:41.95]So therefore the bird would have to go first.
[360:50.93]Okay, so Bird goes in the boat.
[360:56.83]So bird now, what the fuck is this?
[361:00.17]What is happening?
[361:02.64]How do I keep the bird over on the right side?
[361:18.33]So who's stronger, the cat or the dog?
[361:40.78]So Kat goes... And then...
[361:48.57]This is so confusing.
[361:50.85]Okay, where's Peacock?
[361:58.39]You have to take the chicken first.
[362:00.46]Okay, but like, this is such a bizarrely made, like, this is unbelievably confusing.
[362:15.07]So if I have to take the peacock across first,
[362:19.74]Where is the image of him being off the boat on the other side?
[362:22.80]The shit mirrors.
[362:24.75]It just flips for no reason.
[362:27.32]We need like five or six extra frames for this to make sense.
[362:38.77]Just give me the answer.
[362:39.83]I don't even care.
[362:41.57]This is stupid.
[363:00.51]Like, isn't he alone with the dog here?
[363:12.90]The dog won't eat the bird, apparently.
[363:14.94]Okay, apparently the dog's not going to eat the bird, but the fucking cat will eat the dog, and the dog will eat the peacock.
[363:22.41]"'Excuse me?'
[363:25.45]The dog is fine for the bird.
[363:26.83]Only the cat eats the bird.
[363:29.34]Where was the context of cat?
[363:31.25]What do you mean cat eats bird?
[363:33.07]What the fuck is this?
[363:36.84]Only the cat will eat the bird.
[363:38.57]And then only the, oh my God.
[363:40.53]Okay, that's a wild wolf.
[363:41.66]It's eating that peacock right now.
[363:56.32]Okay, so then dog over there, cat here.
[364:06.56]The dog is vegan.
[364:09.34]Dude, alright.
[364:11.15]You're going to tell me to solve your fucking weird puzzle box and not... By the way, it's a classic riddle.
[364:17.49]Okay, by the way, the cat will eat the peacock, but the dog won't eat the peacock, but then the peacock is safe.
[364:24.72]But the peacock will dare to gouge the fucking eyes out of the wizard.
[364:28.06]I don't fucking know.
[364:33.85]Alright, I'm moving on from that.
[364:34.91]Alright, here we go.
[364:36.23]They're going in.
[364:37.36]We get the dog across.
[364:39.02]We come back.
[364:40.89]This is fucking fried, dude.
[364:56.27]If you get the dog across first, the bird will die.
[365:19.49]That guy got it wrong.
[365:20.98]That guy got it wrong.
[365:22.55]I just read that out of chat.
[365:24.30]Somebody got it wrong.
[365:26.71]Two...
[365:32.13]2-4.
[365:33.52]I'm never going to fucking solve this.
[365:35.34]There's too many people yelling at me.
[365:38.50]Okay, 2-4.
[365:39.58]I don't give a shit.
[365:40.47]I'm fucking almost out of this game.
[365:44.11]Two, four, nine, six, three, seven.
[365:56.47]158.
[366:02.69]I don't give a fuck about that one, man.
[366:04.14]That one is...
[366:04.77]I...
[366:06.80]I didn't...
[366:07.38]The rules didn't make any sense.
[366:11.03]You know, you could have just had duct tape, not in a weird box.
[366:14.58]By the way.
[366:16.14]That's a puzzle for kindergartners.
[366:17.35]No, no.
[366:18.43]The VOD Andy's gonna help me here.
[366:21.68]Top comment on the VOD is going to say, bro, dude, like it didn't give him that context.
[366:25.81]I agree.
[366:26.74]You know, maybe if it told the story of the fable first in like a cutscene...
[366:34.52]No, I'm with him.
[366:36.42]You know, the Vaude Andes are with me on this.
[366:48.58]Okay, so I got the duct tape, I can fix the thing.
[366:55.34]Where even is that thing?
[366:59.21]More explanation.
[367:00.23]Wolf eats goat, goat eats cabbage, but wolf won't eat cabbage.
[367:07.29]I remember doing that riddle in the fifth grade.
[367:10.30]And that was my girlfriend that said that, by the way.
[367:12.53]That was not some random hater in the chat room.
[367:16.39]That was girlfriend.
[367:25.36]Hey, I'm a junior detective.
[367:26.61]You give me a pipe puzzle, I'll knock it out of the park.
[367:28.59]You want to put all these frames and shit and tell me, like, don't eat the bird!
[367:31.84]Don't eat the bird!
[367:34.78]I don't care.
[367:37.97]It's from the ninth century.
[367:42.34]Okay.
[367:43.77]What the hell am I doing?
[367:47.72]Right.
[367:48.41]This.
[367:50.50]Can we turn on like grandpa's weird machine?
[367:55.32]There, good as new.
[367:57.68]Nothing happened.
[367:59.09]Hmm, this contraption is obviously powered by something, but what?
[368:06.89]What else do I have to do?
[368:07.92]This is not powered?
[368:26.40]It was literally just remembering what animal is on what side.
[368:28.85]I know, right?
[368:29.49]It was so frustrating.
[368:31.14]Oh, please.
[368:32.30]Oh, please.
[368:37.18]Oh, please.
[368:51.37]Okay.
[368:52.40]Uh, where is that one?
[368:53.34]It's one of the vents on the ground?
[369:00.04]This one here?
[369:03.85]Okay, so this is very simply Wisdom, Eternity, Purity, Charity.
[369:12.30]So what would the number be?
[369:15.97]Right?
[369:17.72]So this one's wisdom?
[369:18.52]Is the amount of, uh, letters?
[369:22.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[369:27.20]Okay, six.
[369:31.50]Uh, what's the top right one?
[369:32.87]That would be Charity.
[369:34.27]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[369:40.04]It actually is 6-7, by the way.
[369:41.85]I'm not being a weirdo.
[369:45.75]That's correct, right?
[369:46.43]There's a bottom left one, top left, top right, bottom right.
[369:55.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[369:57.32]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 6.
[370:12.14]6786.
[370:13.93]That's not correct.
[370:21.79]That's the top left piece, bottom left piece, top right, bottom right, right?
[370:29.55]Six, seven...
[370:32.68]6'8"?
[370:44.86]That's not right.
[370:46.92]Did I get the number?
[370:47.55]Wait.
[370:47.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[370:50.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[370:59.10]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[371:00.59]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[371:03.07]What did I do wrong?
[371:13.87]Is this the wrong piece?
[371:25.70]Dude, the AutoMod is going insane right now.
[371:29.74]This time I actually don't know, to be fair.
[371:36.68]Unless that's not what it is.
[371:50.64]It's not the letter count?
[371:55.32]It's not the letter count.
[371:57.17]What?
[372:02.86]Go to Camilla's car.
[372:08.72]Which one even is Camilla's car?
[372:10.01]The one where Laurie is?
[372:24.88]Car son or train daughter?
[372:30.02]Walking... Me.
[372:37.15]Thank you.
[372:49.77]Which one of these was Camilla's car?
[372:51.26]The third car down.
[372:54.56]Something on a couch?
[373:11.59]This is the doll one.
[373:12.51]This is...
[373:12.89]I don't even know where we are.
[373:24.45]I was here three hours ago where you said you were uninstalling the game.
[373:26.64]It's one more down.
[373:32.92]The little book of simp- okay.
[373:49.07]Okay, dude, what the hell is this?
[373:52.43]Ah.
[373:56.61]What am I even looking at here?
[373:58.40]Surely there is no greater joy for the 19th century woman, young or old, than to bring a piece of linen to life with needlepoint.
[374:08.37]only needle thread care and imagination.
[374:10.67]The word sampler comes from the Latin word exemplum.
[374:15.55]Okay.
[374:17.70]Yeah.
[374:18.33]Yeah.
[374:18.59]Indeed.
[374:18.85]Many gentlemen's head has been turned.
[374:21.14]Marriage fortified is except these monetize for samples.
[374:24.06]Take many forms.
[374:24.74]Okay.
[374:25.48]One classic is the long and narrow band sampler, which features bands of flowery border designs, right?
[374:37.57]Like is this, like do I have to count this?
[374:51.52]Angel, cat, squirrel.
[374:55.07]Most motives are naturalistic objects that have specific meanings in the language of samplers.
[374:59.73]There are a list of common motives in their meaning.
[375:01.51]Horseshoe rabbit
[375:14.27]The wax paper words equals an animal in this book.
[375:20.65]I just literally, when you said that, saw charity dove.
[375:27.58]Okay, so then it's these letters.
[375:33.69]So purity harp, I gotta write this down.
[375:43.53]Okay, purity, it's harp.
[375:51.48]Charity.
[375:52.16]Dove.
[375:53.77]Uh...
[376:05.86]Huh?
[376:07.79]Wisdom is owl?
[376:12.35]And what was the last one?
[376:13.78]Purity, charity, wisdom, eternity, right?
[376:19.69]Crown.
[376:20.13]Crown.
[376:24.59]Eternity crowned.
[376:34.71]I'm taking a picture of this.
[376:40.36]Because, I don't know.
[376:41.89]Why would they have this many?
[376:48.48]Okay, so now is it the amount of words for that one?
[377:03.25]We got another Einstein here, folks.
[377:05.92]Please.
[377:11.14]Please.
[377:20.48]Okay, so... Zephyr, you need like eight sheets of paper in front of you to play these fucking games.
[377:28.72]Alright, Wisdom.
[377:30.64]is the top left one.
[377:32.19]Top left wisdom is owl, which would be three.
[377:44.20]And then...
[377:44.81]Uh...
[377:54.16]It was a wisdom.
[377:55.29]Get close.
[377:55.81]I would end.
[377:56.52]Oh my God.
[377:57.24]I'm going to smash it.
[377:59.78]Close it.
[378:00.28]I want to see these.
[378:01.77]Take a fucking picture of it.
[378:03.32]That's all you do in this game.
[378:04.45]Take a photo of something or write it down.
[378:12.67]Let me take another- Hey, let me take another fucking photo!
[378:16.09]Alright, here!
[378:17.74]Ah, I take- Got it!
[378:23.83]Alright, first one is Wisdom, which is Owl, which is 3.
[378:26.44]The next one is...
[378:36.45]Charity, which is... Dove, which is four?
[378:48.51]The next one is Eternity, which is...
[378:59.47]fucking scream crown which is one two three this better not be three four five six dude I'm gonna be pissed if it's three four five six
[379:15.58]And then purity.
[379:24.96]is four, three, four, five foot.
[379:27.98]That didn't even work.
[379:36.74]What?
[379:40.66]So it's
[379:50.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[379:51.53]It has nothing to do with this.
[379:52.72]It's not the numbers of the letters.
[379:54.37]It's something to do with the embroidery thing.
[379:58.38]The cross-stitch tapestry in the hallway with all the numbers.
[380:03.79]Hold on, I want to see this.
[380:12.28]The thing that was with all the weights?
[380:22.52]Dude, you toked too hard.
[380:23.81]I did not.
[380:26.55]I did not toke at all, actually.
[380:32.67]Where's this tapestry?
[380:33.61]Right here.
[380:36.52]Okay.
[380:37.08]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[380:39.03]Bell.
[380:39.93]Okay.
[380:40.35]Owl is seven.
[380:42.86]So then, oh, come on, dude.
[380:45.89]Owl is seven.
[380:46.94]Then I gotta write this down now too.
[380:50.83]I need a different place to write this down.
[380:53.02]I can't alt-tab.
[380:54.09]The game is 20 years old.
[380:55.40]I wish I could just alt-tab and have a fucking notepad.
[381:00.12]And I can't get the game to run out of the window either.
[381:01.84]Every program I've used just goes
[381:08.63]Give me a, I got a fucking piece of paper right here.
[381:10.74]Fuck it.
[381:24.44]There.
[381:24.92]Alright.
[381:25.38]Okay.
[381:25.62]What do we got?
[381:26.39]Owl.
[381:28.33]Seven.
[381:31.40]Uh-huh.
[381:32.21]Charity.
[381:34.34]Dove.
[381:36.15]Nine.
[381:40.08]Harp?
[381:42.91]Where's the harp?
[381:45.25]Purity, harp, three.
[381:47.47]Eternity, crown, six.
[381:55.54]I'm ready to solve the puzzle.
[382:00.95]Let's go.
[382:10.79]Wrong fucking way.
[382:24.88]Okay.
[382:28.18]Wisdom.
[382:29.77]Seven.
[382:35.92]And then what?
[382:38.03]And then this one, which is, what is that one?
[382:40.46]That one is...
[382:42.79]That one is Charity, which is nine.
[382:48.26]Seven, nine.
[382:51.55]And then Eternity.
[382:54.77]Is that one.
[382:55.29]796.
[383:01.27]And then purity.
[383:02.51]Harry.
[383:10.72]That's...
[383:11.30]Purity is... Yep.
[383:15.51]Give me... No!
[384:14.71]That should do it.
[384:15.71]Yep.
[384:16.27]And I want everybody in the chat room right now.
[384:19.18]VOD, post-VOD, pre-chat, offline chat.
[384:24.58]I want everybody in every single part of this community.
[384:27.30]I don't care where you're on some fucking random ass channel.
[384:30.77]You're on the VOD channel, you're on the second channel, you're on any...
[384:33.44]I don't care.
[384:34.91]I did that lightning quick with liquidity.
[384:47.68]Okay, so now I can actually turn the thing and turn the machine on.
[384:53.93]Please.
[385:02.04]sounds like steam from the engine is moving through those pipes now please let's go this is it
[385:16.55]Dude, your penis is showing.
[385:19.08]I don't care!
[385:26.43]Nobody said that?
[385:34.51]Yeah, they did.
[385:35.22]Scroll up.
[385:40.35]Thank you.
[385:47.55]Green.
[385:48.78]Green.
[385:49.85]Green.
[385:51.00]Green.
[385:52.29]Green.
[385:53.56]rain let's go
[386:04.01]Come on.
[386:15.19]This is stupid.
[386:32.44]The amount of radiation that I'm probably breathing in right now.
[386:45.76]Alright, alright, settle down.
[386:52.90]Alright, this is going crazy.
[387:01.75]Brimstone Canyon, that's where the money is.
[387:08.45]You're never gonna believe what I found.
[387:13.69]Tell the engineer to head for a place in Nevada called Brimstone Canyon.
[387:17.50]Wait, I live in Nevada.
[387:19.23]I wonder if they're near my place.
[387:23.07]Here's the deal.
[387:24.05]When we get there, I'm going to make sure that you get to be the first one to check out the mine.
[387:29.01]I'll call everyone together in the dining car.
[387:31.36]And while we're in there, you slip off the train.
[387:34.35]Will ten minutes be enough of a head start?
[387:38.81]I'll do it in nine.
[387:39.74]That'd be great.
[387:41.08]Think of it as your reward.
[387:42.55]Of course, anything you find in the mine is, well, mine.
[387:46.45]So if I find out that you've taken something without telling me, let's just say things could get ugly.
[387:55.35]Don't worry, you can trust me.
[387:56.69]I have the feeling that thanks to you, we are about to discover something huge.
[388:02.17]Great job, Amy.
[388:04.16]Thank you.
[388:04.72]Amy?
[388:18.72]Whoever built this train was a moron.
[388:25.07]Who built this shit?
[388:26.90]You had to go up and it was like a somebody's heart rate monitor.
[388:34.19]Alright, this is it.
[388:37.69]We're going to the mine.
[388:40.60]You're going to leave me here?
[388:47.59]Imagine there was a key under that rock and it was a skeleton key and it opened every door in every Nancy Drew game ever going forward in perpetuity.
[388:56.00]That's the kind of shit I would put in my game.
[389:00.50]And the name of my game would be called...
[389:03.76]Uncover the Ruck.
[389:06.25]What the fuck, dude?
[389:07.55]What?
[389:09.02]Indie Game of the Year award!
[389:13.39]Save the game?
[389:14.23]Oh shit.
[389:58.32]I got every possible combination wrong.
[390:01.28]That's so annoying.
[390:09.35]Whoa!
[390:18.65]What did you do, Nancy?
[390:20.82]You shouldn't have done that.
[390:22.20]You don't know what's in there.
[390:22.99]You don't know.
[390:25.23]You could cause a fucking landslide.
[390:29.06]Okay.
[390:37.03]Purple lizards.
[390:40.58]Red lizards.
[390:45.87]Oh, I wonder where I'm supposed to go.
[390:48.04]Maybe the one with the yellow lizard.
[390:53.15]It's kind of cute.
[390:57.16]Purple Lizard.
[391:04.62]Okay.
[391:08.41]Can I get in this?
[391:10.16]Down.
[391:14.12]This might be loud dude, just be careful.
[391:23.38]Okay, orange.
[391:32.17]Orange?
[391:32.94]Wait, is he saying go this way or go down there?
[391:37.78]Purple.
[391:38.72]Red.
[391:45.62]Okay, I can't.
[391:46.39]Can I go this way?
[391:49.12]Green.
[391:49.87]Got it.
[391:52.74]Purple.
[391:56.09]What the hell?
[391:56.77]What's this?
[391:57.42]What's this here for?
[391:59.57]What's that here for?
[392:02.94]I don't know what that is, but somebody take a mental screenshot of that.
[392:05.51]And this one.
[392:08.16]Oh my god, dude.
[392:12.34]Jake was too meticulous not to have left a clue somewhere as to how you're supposed to move them.
[392:17.42]Well, might as well just guess.
[392:18.40]It has something to do with that symbol I saw before.
[392:26.73]We'll just kill her like five times.
[392:28.10]It's fine.
[392:41.19]It's not that one
[392:51.27]I've seen that symbol before.
[392:55.32]Uh, the one on the left is correct.
[392:58.79]Okay, hold on.
[393:00.56]I need to make a different name.
[393:22.81]okay so far so good I think I made a boo-boo this is gonna take too long
[393:40.42]Okay, so far so good.
[393:51.04]So that's the last one.
[394:01.28]Okay, so this is the last one.
[394:02.67]Oh my god, do I actually have to go all the way back and fucking find every single one of these?
[394:12.25]Another symbol.
[394:29.99]Oh shit.
[394:41.46]No, no, no, don't load, save it.
[394:52.75]Okay, if I were to guess, it'd be this one.
[394:56.61]Oh my god.
[394:57.39]Oh my god.
[395:00.01]Oh my god, dude.
[395:03.15]No, there's no way, right?
[395:04.41]There's no way.
[395:06.22]Literally no way.
[395:07.22]This is not possible.
[395:10.01]This is impossible.
[395:15.84]What are the odds that I'd know that?
[395:18.11]That's crazy.
[395:18.98]I'm getting such crazy luck.
[395:37.69]One of the mods repost that picture because it's I can't alt tab and I can't scroll up and looks like some people have been talking.
[395:54.51]What is it?
[395:56.08]I don't keep up.
[395:57.37]We're at the end of the game.
[396:00.36]Oh, wait.
[396:00.84]Hold on.
[396:05.33]What number am I?
[396:09.58]Some people I've been talking is an understatement.
[396:11.27]Alright, which one did I not do?
[396:20.80]Okay, do you want to know something actually crazy?
[396:25.07]I actually guessed on the first two or three of them.
[396:30.10]And I'll never be able to take credit for doing that because I cheated on the last three.
[396:45.95]That's your...
[396:46.67]I'm just... Look, you can believe me or not... Is this him?
[396:52.88]Camille.
[396:54.07]It figures he'd be carrying a picture of her.
[396:56.01]Hmm, there's something underneath.
[396:58.60]to Jake hurley postmaster Denver territory of Colorado looks like a letter April 14 1865.
[397:06.60]Oh my god, this is the murder weapon.
[397:11.83]Believe me, Jake, my boy, I cannot, I can think of nothing more pleasant than touring the west of...
[397:17.61]board your private train.
[397:20.15]But much as I would like to accept your invitation, the duties and responsibilities of my office forbid it.
[397:25.57]I cannot leave Washington until this terrible war is over and the states are united once more.
[397:30.99]Your humble friend, Dave.
[397:32.55]I would scarcely leave my office at all these days were it not for Mary.
[397:38.48]Tonight, at her insistence, I will be accompanying her to the Ford Theater to see a comedy called Our American Cousin.
[397:46.27]Have you seen it?'
[397:47.69]Mary assumes me, assures me, that I'll enjoy it despite the fact that for some strange reason I've never felt at ease when at the theater.
[397:56.60]Perhaps tonight will be different.
[397:59.51]Write to me soon.
[398:00.43]Your mission never failed to boost my spirits.
[398:05.23]Your humble friend,
[398:07.44]Abe Lincoln.
[398:11.03]Oh, shit.
[398:12.69]Oh my gosh, this is from Abraham Lincoln.
[398:15.80]What?
[398:16.30]And April 14th is the day he was assassinated.
[398:19.10]This letter must be worth a fortune.
[398:21.63]That's just what I thought too!
[398:23.67]Come on.
[398:24.70]You're thinking about the Abraham Lincoln letter.
[398:27.19]See, what I didn't tell you when I gave you that letter Jake wrote to Ruth is that I also found his diary.
[398:32.73]Which is how I found out he'd gotten to be friends with President Lincoln.
[398:36.77]And that he'd gotten a letter from Abe that he knew would be so valuable someday that he always kept it on his person.
[398:42.72]Can I have it?
[398:44.89]Sure.
[398:45.19]No.
[398:45.47]You split the fucking money.
[398:46.86]See, I knew if we could just find Jake's body, we'd find the letter.
[398:50.33]And you did it, Amy.
[398:51.42]You did it.
[398:52.57]I'm going to be famous.
[398:54.34]Good famous for once.
[398:56.04]Split the money.
[398:56.76]So you never really cared about finding Jake's mine?
[398:59.63]Nah.
[399:01.11]I mean, it would have been nice if it was filled with gold and silver and stuff, but this is what I was really after.
[399:06.03]And you followed me because you didn't trust me?
[399:10.26]I trusted you to find it.
[399:11.91]I just didn't trust you to give it to me.
[399:14.73]And now that you have...
[399:16.32]Did you come down here armed?
[399:22.01]Because that was a huge mistake.
[399:25.16]How do I know you'd keep lying?
[399:29.82]Oh my gosh.
[399:31.53]What if there was like this cave-in and we were trapped, but I was the only one who made it out?
[399:38.09]Uh, excuse me?
[399:40.91]Oh my gosh, that way I could not only say that I found the letter, but that I tried to save you.
[399:46.93]Only you did something stupid, and it was all I could do to save myself.
[399:50.90]Oh my gosh, I'd make the national news for sure.
[399:54.54]And people would say I was smart and resourceful and courageous.
[399:58.48]This is going to be loud.
[399:59.52]Turn your speakers down.
[400:04.01]You don't understand.
[400:05.32]People are finally going to respect me.
[400:08.17]I'm taking my headphones out.
[400:09.29]It's going to be an explosion.
[400:10.54]Sorry.
[400:12.70]Guys, turn your headsets down now.
[400:20.97]The opening's blocked!
[400:21.97]I'm trapped!
[400:23.02]It'll take forever to dig through those rocks.
[400:25.47]There's gotta be another way out of here.
[400:54.25]What about email?
[400:55.01]What if I get sent an email?
[400:58.34]Zero inbox?
[400:59.32]That's not accurate.
[401:00.87]Everybody has like 10,000 unread emails.
[401:13.43]This is gonna be a minecart minigame and it's gonna end awfully if I do not save it.
[401:40.03]I kind of landed that though.
[401:41.51]What?
[402:09.58]Can we turn Grandpa's mine into an amusement park?
[402:20.70]What?
[402:21.89]What the hell?
[402:23.44]That was wrong.
[402:24.06]Wait, I thought the one dropped off a cliff.
[402:34.16]You just went towards the skull.
[402:35.23]I thought the skull was saying, hey, to the right, it's dropping down and ending.
[402:38.60]I know where I'm going.
[402:52.02]Yeah, because it's on the left side.
[402:53.41]This one was in a weird spot though.
[403:01.99]Yeah, see, that one was weird.
[403:19.98]Be great to get a huge yawn from her right now.
[403:34.78]Is that it?
[403:47.44]I think we're upside down.
[403:50.47]Oh!
[403:55.55]Those are scrunching bones!
[403:57.97]Oh my, I was gonna say, holy shit!
[403:59.92]This game got fuckin' violent!
[404:01.73]Are you alright?
[404:04.73]Nancy!
[404:06.14]Is everything okay?
[404:07.83]It is now.
[404:08.93]As soon as we discovered you and Lori weren't on the train, we jumped off and high-tailed it back here.
[404:12.97]What the heck's going on?
[404:14.54]I'm sure Lori will be glad to tell you all about it.
[404:17.24]Darn you, Natalie!
[404:18.47]It's Nancy.
[404:20.24]Another one solved.
[404:26.65]He canceled all her credit cards and said that from now on, Lori will have to support herself.
[404:32.06]She has yet to stop crying.
[404:33.49]Tino Balducci told reporters that he knew what Laurie was up to all along and said he let Frank, Joe, and me solve the case so we amateurs could enjoy his limelight.
[404:43.46]Joe was just about to belt him when a big argument broke out between John Gray and Charlina over whether John had really recorded Camille's ghost.
[404:51.61]She started calling him a crackpot, and then he started calling her a hack.
[404:55.60]Then, well, let's just say that soon the press was no longer interested in what Tino had to say.
[405:00.76]As for Jake Hurley, it turns out that his letter from Abe Lincoln is worth a small fortune.
[405:05.50]Pretty ironic, huh?
[405:07.05]Jake spent his whole life searching for gold when all along he possessed something far more valuable.
[405:13.51]His uncanny knack for making friends.
[405:16.16]Love, Nancy.
[405:18.78]Is this letter real?
[405:19.90]To like anybody?
[405:20.57]Like actually real?
[405:22.01]Is this like a real person?
[405:26.88]I got awarded the title of...
[405:35.49]Hanging with the Hardys Award for spending maybe a little too much time with Frank and Joe, excuse me?
[405:44.97]Uh, I spent just enough time hanging out with Frank and Joe.
[405:48.16]I didn't spend an awkward amount of time.
[405:58.10]Well, cause I went to, I talked to them once or twice.
[406:00.26]Okay.
[406:03.85]Have you ever been to Paris, France?
[406:05.71]Well, preparez-vous, because that's where my next mystery adventure takes place.
[406:09.67]I'm going to be the assistant to Minette, a famous fashion designer.
[406:13.99]I'll be working undercover to find out why she's been acting so peculiar lately.
[406:17.93]throwing tantrums, firing people.
[406:20.19]She's even started wearing a mask for no apparent reason.
[406:23.96]Her studio is in this spooky-looking centuries-old moulin.
[406:27.07]That's French for windmill.
[406:28.98]Of course, that doesn't have anything to do with her strange behavior.
[406:31.89]Or does it?
[406:33.64]What's this one?
[406:36.27]Okay.
[406:44.00]That was a good one.
[406:45.19]That was really fun.
[406:45.76]I like that one a lot.
[406:53.18]That Nancy Drew one hit pretty hard.
[406:56.00]It was perfect.
[406:57.74]It was a good length.
[407:06.93]You have to do a Nancy Drew tier list.
[407:08.72]Okay, I think I have to play more than a dozen of them to be able to do that.
[407:16.65]The Haunted Mansion one is S tier.
[407:17.90]I've played.
[407:18.38]Didn't I play the Haunted Mansion one?
[407:27.13]A dozen is insane.
[407:28.38]I think there's like 30 of these, even more potentially.
[407:36.45]Alright, that's going to be it.
[407:38.12]See you later.
[407:38.52]Thanks for watching.
[407:39.06]Thanks for hanging out.
[407:39.76]That was Nancy Drew and...
[407:42.52]The mystery of the train that went through Blue Canyon.
[407:52.17]See you guys in probably a few days.
[407:54.99]It'll be live probably early, midweek.
[407:58.01]It'll be like a Tuesday-ish scenario.
[408:01.16]Something like that.
[408:02.28]Keep an eye on the sus.
[408:06.75]See you guys in a few days.
[408:12.78]Okay, I still got to finish Withering Rooms.
[408:14.26]There's like an hour left in that game.
[408:15.63]I got to finish it.
[408:20.81]Dun dun dun dun.
[408:27.49]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[408:40.20]Yeah, I'll do that very soon.
[408:44.89]W. Nancy Drew.
[408:47.20]W. Chat.
[408:51.76]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[408:52.74]Goodbye.
[408:53.55]Call your mother.
[408:54.13]Have a great one.
[408:54.83]Thanks for sticking around.
[408:56.06]I had a blast.
[408:57.16]That was a great time.
[408:58.25]Hope you had a good time too.
[408:59.25]See ya later.
[409:46.72]Thank you.
