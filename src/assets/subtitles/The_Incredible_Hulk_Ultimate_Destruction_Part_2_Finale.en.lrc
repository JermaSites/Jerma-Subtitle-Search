[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.78]Hello.
[00:02.36]Good afternoon.
[00:05.37]How are ya?
[00:12.87]Fresh water.
[00:14.59]Keep me going.
[00:20.82]We're going to continue playing the Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[00:27.41]Don't know what the Incredible Hulk is or what ultimate destruction means.
[00:31.83]Um, you're in for a big treat today.
[00:36.31]And let me tell you, there are like 300 other Marvel characters.
[00:40.57]If you think the Hulk is cool, just wait till you see fucking Radiation Man.
[00:48.29]I'm sure he exists in Marvel.
[00:49.37]Let's find out.
[00:50.03]Okay, uh, Radiation Man.
[00:54.34]We have a database with like fucking 5,000 superheroes.
[00:57.58]Yes, Radioactive Man, I guess.
[00:59.78]Yeah.
[01:04.86]Yeah, Radioactive Man, he's there.
[01:09.82]Marvel is The Simpsons of superheroes?
[01:16.81]Wait, am I following that correctly?
[01:20.41]It's, wait, jokes to The Simpsons are like Marvel to superheroes, is what you're saying.
[01:24.88]Okay, I get, I get you now, I get you.
[01:35.84]Wrong order?
[01:37.96]Jokes on The Simpsons are to like superheroes that exist in Marvel.
[01:43.72]Howard the Duck is the best character.
[01:45.08]Even if it was a frog, I'd probably agree with you.
[01:48.10]Why is there no frog Marvel superhero?
[01:49.81]Is there?
[01:51.89]Is there a frog man?
[01:53.03]Let's see.
[01:53.99]Frog Marvel.
[01:56.25]Is there a frog in Marvel?
[01:57.59]Yep, there is.
[01:59.21]His name is Leapfrog!
[02:02.62]Leapfrog!
[02:03.34]Cool.
[02:06.78]Why do I not own every single comic of this?
[02:10.16]That's unfortunate.
[02:20.07]Here's to a good stream.
[02:20.93]Yeah, we're going to play some more Hulk.
[02:22.89]I feel like I'm going to beat the game.
[02:25.11]I think there's only like another four plus five hours or so left in the game, and I'm going to beat it.
[02:31.20]If I don't beat it, well, then I'm in deep shit because if I can't beat Hulk, if I cannot beat Hulk Ultimate Destruction, but I will beat Simpsons Hit and Run, there's a problem there.
[02:46.47]Anyways, let's go.
[02:48.21]We're just going to pick up where we left off yesterday.
[02:51.30]...is exactly right here.
[02:57.26]Just remember the controls.
[02:58.38]A is jump.
[02:58.96]Good.
[03:04.28]You have to eat a Funko Pop if you can't beat the game.
[03:07.97]I don't want to eat a Funko Pop.
[03:09.39]Alright, let's keep going.
[03:18.99]Show us your room so we can make fun of you.
[03:20.77]No, I learned my lesson as of yesterday, okay?
[03:24.49]Lesson has been learned.
[03:29.47]I ain't never shown myself on camera ever again.
[03:40.45]Good.
[03:45.06]We're sorry, okay?
[03:49.85]Somebody just hit me in the air, right?
[03:51.31]That's not even possible.
[03:53.61]That's not even possible to hit me in the air.
[04:02.67]The threat has dropped.
[04:05.51]What that means is I can't see him anymore, therefore he doesn't exist.
[04:11.37]When are they going to innovate on that, by the way?
[04:16.15]I want some real AI innovation.
[04:18.74]GTA 6.
[04:20.34]Check this out.
[04:21.74]Holy fucking holy shit.
[04:23.76]I just figured out the greatest system ever.
[04:26.24]You guys know the Nemesis system?
[04:27.80]That everyone loved and was obsessed with in Shadow of Mordor?
[04:35.14]Imagine in GTA 6 there's like detectives.
[04:39.33]That like will track you down and like they'll do their little intro.
[04:43.29]They'll come in in the like detective car and they'll be like asking you questions.
[04:46.39]That would be incredible.
[04:49.88]It won't happen that frequently.
[04:51.08]That would be awesome.
[04:57.13]To have like a nemesis system, but it's detectives in GTA 6.
[04:59.67]Did I just break the bridge?
[05:08.27]Can I break the bridge?
[05:11.83]Where's the star?
[05:12.43]On top?
[05:12.79]Is it on top of the bridge?
[05:13.48]Nintendo should hire you.
[05:17.00]But Nintendo doesn't... There hasn't been a Nintendo Grand Theft Auto since... Ever.
[05:22.22]Has it ever been on... Okay, I can make this jump, I promise.
[05:32.88]Just break it so I can get it!
[05:46.07]The camera.
[05:47.80]Sorry.
[05:48.28]I hope nobody was in there.
[05:50.90]Okay.
[05:52.90]Hey, excuse me.
[05:56.30]Was that a missile?
[05:57.32]Don't worry.
[06:00.34]There's always a guy with a missile launcher.
[06:02.74]Where is he?
[06:04.65]Find him.
[06:04.99]Come here.
[06:18.37]I want you to watch me do this.
[06:25.54]You're gonna watch me complete this.
[06:29.46]It's Chad.
[06:30.44]No!
[06:30.80]No!
[06:31.52]Put me down!
[06:32.40]You're gonna sit here.
[06:32.94]You're gonna watch me get to this star.
[06:35.49]No, please.
[06:36.29]You're so bad.
[06:37.41]You can't do it.
[06:38.47]Please don't hurt me.
[06:40.35]I'm not gonna hurt you.
[06:45.15]I'm not gonna hurt you.
[06:47.63]But the sharks might.
[06:51.05]Well, it turns out he hit the edge of the bridge.
[06:54.01]Sorry.
[06:54.98]Wait, what are you guys doing?
[06:56.84]What are you people doing?
[06:58.30]Why are you jumping off the bridge?
[07:00.86]Hey!
[07:05.92]Why are they... I'm not doing this, am I?
[07:09.80]I have nothing to do with this.
[07:25.66]Oh, I can't.
[07:29.29]Oh, cut it out.
[07:32.53]Let's do it.
[07:33.28]Our stolen mainframe interface is directly into the division satellite tracking system.
[07:37.70]Those are viewers dropping.
[07:39.58]Oh, my God.
[07:41.46]Get the fuck out of here.
[07:42.48]Secured research facilities.
[07:44.14]Get out of here.
[07:44.74]These profilers are as delicate as they are rare.
[07:47.69]So you're going to have to bring the whole truck back.
[07:50.27]Oh, that sounds like fun.
[07:50.91]The truck is secured by a mechanized escort team in some sort of energy defense field.
[07:55.45]If I had more time, I could get some data on this.
[07:58.05]Intercept the truck and bring it back.
[08:00.00]That sounds easy enough.
[08:02.65]But anyways, detective.
[08:04.84]And they'd be named.
[08:06.06]And each person in a different game could have their own detective.
[08:09.31]That was like coming after him.
[08:10.95]Maybe you could even be a detective.
[08:12.71]No, that would never work.
[08:14.45]Maybe you could be a detective in somebody else's game.
[08:16.87]But no, the first person that was able to invade your game like Dark Souls style and be a detective would just fucking fly a helicopter to where you were and just launch missiles at you while you ran around in a circle until you died and then they would leave your game.
[08:29.22]This would never work.
[08:30.42]And on paper, it's a great idea.
[08:31.88]In practice, it's horrible.
[08:41.69]Intercept.
[08:42.11]Okay, I have to take the whole truck?
[08:47.19]Jeremy, you're cool.
[08:47.87]Hope you're doing well.
[08:48.88]Hey, thanks.
[08:54.04]Did I make it?
[08:54.98]I did.
[09:04.95]Up.
[09:06.25]Forward.
[09:07.23]Dash.
[09:10.56]I think I made okay time here That was a nice sponsored one guy How do you sponsor one guy?
[09:29.04]I don't understand
[09:36.79]Do you mean I'm paying people to write nice things about me?
[09:39.69]Is that what you're saying?
[09:40.67]Alright, I'm gonna take it slow.
[09:42.45]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:44.07]Give me this shit.
[09:48.38]Shield.
[09:48.76]Okay, where's this helicopter?
[09:54.76]Oh, damn it.
[09:56.74]Oh, shit.
[09:57.12]It looks like three detectives got in my game.
[10:01.40]No.
[10:02.46]Okay.
[10:06.14]Yeah, where's the invest- nice investigation you got going here?
[10:08.89]Oh, there he is.
[10:11.01]Oh, the three of you in a Discord together.
[10:12.55]I think it's funny to, like, come in my game and do this.
[10:16.19]How do I turn off online mode?
[10:18.75]Because that's what's gonna happen.
[10:23.50]Anybody know?
[10:24.08]Nope, I can't wait to read, like, the 50 fucking Steam discussion threads about how to turn off online mode.
[10:29.44]Thanks a lot, guys.
[10:39.88]I just got absolutely destroyed.
[10:41.90]That was insane.
[10:43.14]Okay.
[10:43.86]So.
[10:45.59]Lesson learned.
[10:46.81]Gotta destroy the helicopters first.
[10:53.41]If only you had a move that blocked missiles.
[10:55.67]I know.
[10:56.25]It's called play in offline mode.
[11:02.42]It's gonna run down the road.
[11:10.86]Nice Funko Pop, loser.
[11:12.50]Where were you yesterday?
[11:16.86]Are you watching the VOD and you think it's a live chat?
[11:24.54]Oh wait, that doesn't make any sense.
[11:25.52]How would that be possible?
[11:26.36]Alright, I'm going for it.
[11:27.70]Here we go.
[11:27.94]There they are.
[11:28.32]Alright, alright, alright.

[13:22.42]Am I ever going to get you guys to stop talking about Funko Pops?

[14:53.06]What?
[14:54.10]I gotta break it!
[14:54.68]Throw something at it!
[14:59.94]Who the fuck are you?
[15:00.70]Ugh!
[15:10.20]Okay, get it!
[15:11.08]Is it electrified still?
[15:15.57]Wait, it needs... What the fuck?
[15:30.45]Locate division transport.
[15:31.75]Retrieve division transport.
[15:33.21]Okay, I located it, and I tried to retrieve it.
[15:41.03]what do you mean read locate transport retrieve transport it's there it is what else do I have to do besides play city heroes they don't even exist anymore
[16:35.10]Why do I feel like I'm at, like, x5 speed?
[16:42.82]Help!
[16:46.90]No, don't throw the tank!
[16:49.91]What is- Okay, like, seriously.

[17:09.09]Why is this tuned like this?
[17:14.05]Fucking god.
[17:14.69]I'm about to die.
[17:23.48]Because the helicopters fly around at 1200 miles per hour and they drive into the fucking ground.
[17:31.04]and into buildings and it doesn't even matter they just slam and skid all over everything I was tuned like that crazy over here come on
[18:10.20]Why do I have the bus?
[18:12.59]Why do I have the bus in my hand?
[18:14.53]If you were in this bus, if you could get across the whole city in like two minutes instead of like 40.
[18:20.59]Okay, mission objective.
[18:25.02]Disable division transport vehicle by throwing things at it.
[18:28.66]Wasn't I doing that?
[18:31.67]I was throwing shit at it already.
[18:39.52]How many things do I have to throw at it?
[18:45.44]Do I have to keep doing this until it's broke?
[18:53.39]No, I don't.
[18:53.95]Do I?
[18:58.35]They're destroying the thing.
[19:00.25]I can't even, man.
[19:01.47]This is fucking ridiculous.
[19:03.40]This is made by The Simpsons hit and run devs.
[19:05.98]No chance that it's not.
[19:07.72]No chance.
[19:11.37]It has to have been.
[19:27.43]Get!
[19:33.01]No, don't jump in the water.
[19:33.89]How do I avoid the water?
[19:35.09]How do I avoid the water?
[19:47.22]How far am I?
[19:47.74]Where's the nearest one?
[19:49.55]What?
[19:51.49]Fuck.
[19:51.71]I have to go around the whole thing?
[19:53.19]That's not cool.
[20:05.27]Here comes a fall joke.
[20:06.74]No, I don't want to do this one again.
[20:12.74]Can anyone count how many times?
[20:14.30]Okay, how many missions have I done so far?
[20:17.26]I think I've done, what, like 10 missions?
[20:20.05]I think at every single mission at the end I've said, no, no, I don't want to do this one again.
[20:23.71]I ran by it.
[20:25.03]I ran by it because of the fucker.
[20:30.22]I'm literally not even paying attention to the game.
[20:31.52]I'm just speaking to you guys.
[20:35.02]Oh!
[20:55.87]But what I was saying was, I don't think I've ended a mission and gone, I wish I could do that one again.
[21:13.92]Shield grind.
[21:15.03]I'm going to get the shield grind.
[21:18.97]I have 100,000 Hulk points.
[21:21.29]I was going to say green points.
[21:29.82]Alright.
[21:30.42]Shield grind.
[21:31.64]Grind any shield just like a board.
[21:35.66]I don't want... How is this going to even help me?
[21:39.20]What?
[21:46.84]How is this going to help me?
[21:47.84]Okay.
[21:52.56]Club smasher.
[21:53.67]Air Sonic.
[21:54.83]Missile punchback.
[21:56.49]Deflect projectiles with a well-timed punchback.
[22:04.47]Thank God.
[22:05.01]I'll buy it.
[22:09.89]I want to try this move out.
[22:12.51]Remember, the shield grind is a full letter grade.
[22:15.35]Oh, is that a car?
[22:22.38]That's actually... Alright, cool.
[22:26.10]There are 30 missions.
[22:26.72]I'll see you guys next week.
[22:35.58]I've already done like 15 of them.
[22:36.76]Okay, you can target.
[22:45.15]Let's see.
[22:46.35]What if I just punch wildly?
[22:49.93]Will it work?
[22:53.21]That is confirmed.
[22:54.33]I have vision.
[22:56.41]Oh, so that's how we want to play it.
[23:04.03]If they fire ten of them at you, you're gonna get hit by nine.
[23:15.15]But also they die, that's true.
[23:20.87]Alright, let's go.
[23:27.78]Holy shit, it is actually the same depth.
[23:29.82]Yeah, I can tell.
[23:43.39]Why do they call him the Hulk?
[23:56.90]It's the... What do you mean?
[23:58.02]You're talking about like why do... Why do they call him the Hulk?
[24:04.45]Because he's a big person?
[24:07.49]Like huge?
[24:08.49]Hulking?
[24:11.01]Jacked?
[24:11.81]Large?
[24:13.01]Lots of mass?
[24:14.21]What are you... I don't know.
[24:15.17]Alright, I gotta buy more shit.
[24:28.06]Yeah, that's like mass.
[24:30.14]That's just what it means.
[24:36.31]Critical Thunderclap.
[24:37.09]No, no, no.
[24:37.39]It's too expensive.
[24:38.07]I want like good... Air Critical Atomic.
[24:41.35]Air Enemy Grapple.
[24:43.01]Yes.
[24:46.99]Those guys are so... Spear Impale.
[24:50.23]Max Charge a Club Throw in Spear Hulk class opponents.
[24:54.98]Yeah.
[24:57.23]Why do I feel like that sentence... I can't even comprehend this sentence.
[25:02.92]Max charge a club throw and spear hulk class opponents.
[25:10.04]I'm comprehending it.
[25:11.12]Max charge a club throw and spear hulk class opponents.
[25:20.33]Whatever.
[25:27.62]Yep, running, uh, definitely.
[25:30.44]Bowling.
[25:33.73]Yes.
[25:34.87]Give me this.

[26:20.96]Yep.
[26:22.88]Alright.
[26:23.72]Save it.
[26:28.34]It's a superhero prototype, also made by The Simpsons Hit and Run devs.
[26:38.28]This is literally an RKO.
[26:42.89]Why did you read that like a restaurant commercial?
[26:44.91]I did?
[26:45.17]I don't know, because it was like a classic.
[26:49.82]Oh, turn this into a classic.
[26:52.86]They usually say that before they say, like, their classic pasta, or their classic breadsticks, or their classic Italian cuisine, or pair it with a classic red wine.
[27:00.12]I don't know.
[27:00.56]That's what they say.
[27:01.18]Classic.
[27:02.18]Hey, you posted cringe, bro.

[37:27.76]Target acquired, sir.
[37:30.06]We're locked on.
[37:30.78]Don't you think you should have written that on a piece of paper and held it up beforehand?
[37:34.97]You know what I mean?
[37:37.31]We could have saved ourselves an entire epic boss fight if you just held up a fucking note that said all this.
[37:44.88]But I do.
[37:49.70]It's got a tracking thing in your head.
[37:50.80]Just text it to me.

[46:09.59]We don't have time to get into the quantum electrochemistry.
[46:13.03]Bottom line, exposure to this gas will render you comatose in seconds.
[46:17.64]It seems the gas is a blend of two slowly reacting agents.
[46:21.32]giving us a brief window for the ocean you'll have to grab each pod haul it to the coastline and toss it into the ocean before you lose consciousness move fast have to move and get that gas part away from you it could cause you damage just throw it into the drinking supply of the whole city
[46:52.66]Locate military gas pods.
[46:54.22]Safely dispose of military gas pods.
[46:58.88]Don't drink ocean water?
[46:59.82]Where do you think your water comes from?
[47:00.88]Uh, uh, ding!
[47:04.23]Ding dong!
[47:04.71]Comes from the ocean.
[47:05.67]Comes from water in the Earth.
[47:12.15]Well, I located the... There's a big guy here.
[47:20.90]Wait, punch!
[47:25.83]Did it work?

[48:45.49]The Hulk is a demon. Uh, no. I mean he's not biblical in any way.
[48:55.68]That doesn't make any sense to me.

[49:03.25]Seriously?
[49:10.53]Are you kidding me?
[49:12.87]Look, grab.
[49:14.53]I can't grab him.
[49:15.45]I can't grab him.
[49:16.88]There's no grab.

[52:11.92]Why would I need to finish him with an elbow drop?
[52:14.30]Finish him with a... Slash.
[52:23.24]Fuck, I should have done that that loud.
[52:24.48]Listen to my voice.
[52:25.24]Listen to this.
[52:26.44]There's an air pocket in my... Right now there's an air pocket in my throat.
[52:29.80]God, I lost it.
[52:30.56]Did I lose it?
[52:31.04]Yeah, fuck.
[52:33.99]You know when you're eating, and your voice, the food gets stuck in a really weird place where your vocal cords are?
[52:41.04]And you end up with this crazy voice that can never be replicated?
[52:45.14]I love when that happens, and I try to keep it as long as I can.
[52:49.67]I try to make phone calls when that happens to me.
[52:52.43]Calling people that I know.
[52:53.19]Like, here it is, here it is, okay, okay, calm down.
[52:58.55]And I'll call, like, fucking friends and family members and be like, hey man, just checking in.
[53:04.23]That's me imitating it, but it sounds insane when you actually do it.
[53:07.85]People are like, fuck you.
[53:13.08]Hermie?
[53:14.44]Oh, yeah.
[53:16.06]You're a fucking weirdo.

[62:53.57]I would say probably three.
[62:56.95]Okay.
[62:57.76]Fucking relax!
[62:59.04]Oh my god!
[63:07.26]These helicopters are unbelievable.
[63:20.16]You know what I think the worst part about that one was?
[63:22.20]Was the, like, I'm eating it, like, yum, yum, yum, yum thing.
[63:25.51]I think that might have been the worst part.
[63:27.85]That's where I would have left.
[63:29.21]Right?
[63:34.11]Where is it?
[63:34.49]I know it's here.
[63:35.09]Why are you still even flying around like that?
[63:45.60]You have no health.
[63:46.30]You're exploding.
[63:47.12]Okay.
[63:51.99]That was just showing off for the camera.
[63:54.16]Okay.
[64:05.69]Got it!
[64:06.81]Oh!
[64:10.27]There.
[64:20.15]I wanna- I want the helicopter that's flying- where's the helicopter?
[64:26.44]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[64:52.72]You guys didn't think this was the finale of the 4th of July?
[64:55.90]Really?
[64:57.06]Okay.
[64:57.82]So, would you keep telling me that what I said yesterday was not accurate?
[65:02.87]I'd love to hear about your thesis on that.
[65:23.41]Why can I not punch the missiles back?
[65:25.79]I gotta get out of this.
[65:28.47]I'm just gonna grab the thing and run.
[65:37.32]Like, why even fight these things?
[65:39.04]It's just not even possible.
[65:43.48]Impossible.
[65:44.20]This game's impossible.
[65:53.36]Wait, did I not even... Come on!
[65:57.67]No fucking way!
[66:00.31]What?
[66:00.85]What are you talking about?
[66:03.81]Oh, come on!
[66:07.96]I don't... I was right!
[66:10.00]I don't even need to do this stupid big long-winded animation.
[66:13.20]Just throw it in!
[66:17.86]I don't have to do this long-winded Mario thing.
[66:21.24]Just throw it in.
[66:25.40]Yeah, make sure we didn't get here.
[66:26.42]Do a hammer throw.
[66:29.06]No, I don't have to do that.
[66:30.28]There's a Jump King spot right here.
[66:33.10]Good.
[66:37.95]Good.
[66:38.39]Alright, wait.
[66:46.45]How is he following me this well?
[66:48.21]Like, how is it possible you follow me that directly?
[66:51.43]He's 10 times bigger than me, more than that.
[66:53.35]Like, he's probably 25 times larger than I am.
[66:58.49]Let's just skate.
[67:00.21]Never mind.
[67:09.17]Sorry, I forgot this was the missile game.
[67:21.51]He's right here.
[67:25.47]Make funny burger jokes.
[67:27.46]We already did it.
[67:28.02]Didn't you laugh at it?
[67:28.92]You were here when we all laughed at it.
[67:30.34]This is very, very, very funny.
[67:40.17]He'll throw it into the ocean.
[67:41.09]So I can just turn around and just drop it in.
[67:45.47]Holds up burger.
[67:46.45]I mean, holds up burger.
[67:49.92]Wait, is that you doing the holds up, like, spork thing?
[67:54.04]Did I make it?
[68:08.31]Gas, gas, gas, gas, pick up.
[68:24.63]Into the ocean.
[68:25.35]Got it.
[68:26.27]I win.
[68:26.43]Mission complete.
[68:28.17]Okay, I did it.
[68:29.60]So now, good.
[68:30.48]New Blonsky files.
[68:53.43]I win.
[68:53.71]No, I do.
[68:54.15]Alright, next story.
[68:57.18]A bird in the hand.
[69:00.90]Do I have 93,000?
[69:01.64]No, I need more than that.
[69:02.82]Um.
[69:02.90]Exactly what I wanted.
[69:25.61]Can I get a reset here?
[69:27.09]Can I get a reset of the map?
[69:44.80]Let's go back to the church where it's safe.
[70:00.15]$50 came in from Goiki.

[70:10.35]$50, they say.
[70:11.47]Everyone tweet hashtag burger, get it trending.

[70:16.41]I'm pretty sure all popular food items always have like 10,000 to 20,000 tweets a minute.
[70:22.10]It's not going to take very much.
[70:29.58]I just want to buy moves.
[70:31.36]But thanks for the $50, Goiki.
[70:34.74]Thanks for the ridiculous amount of bits.
[70:37.26]Appreciate it.

[72:22.00]Alright, let's do this.
[72:27.92]Alright, grab and then throw it back.
[72:33.85]Oh, that was off the screen.
[72:37.75]I couldn't even see it.
[72:41.41]Yeah, you can do that.
[72:46.27]I wouldn't like to be in Ross's shoes.
[72:47.89]The military's insurance bill is going to skyrocket.
[72:53.80]Wait, you just throw it back?
[72:57.16]You're not supposed to do it like that, but okay.
[73:06.60]You catch it, and then you hold B. I just whipped it back.
[73:10.12]Alright, let's go.
[73:12.47]Well, I can only grab one at a time, so it doesn't really matter.
[73:15.69]Ash is much better, though.
[73:33.56]Hulk is a stoner.
[73:35.22]You know, I was thinking about saying the... Oh, I hold the missile and it's like a big joint, right?
[73:39.94]I was thinking about it, but that... Figured that was gonna put a lot of minus twos in the chat.
[73:43.94]But somebody... Yeah, you said it.
[73:45.52]So you can take the blame on that one.
[74:01.99]So funny.
[74:02.59]Haha, weed.
[74:06.16]Didn't say it.
[74:07.16]I told you I didn't say it.
[74:08.04]Holy shit, that's really far.
[74:24.81]That's... Is there a level 3 on this too?
[74:27.35]I hope so.
[74:35.53]Did I smoke a bong today?
[74:38.63]Well... I would really highly recommend not breaking down glass and smoking it.
[74:47.22]I hope that's not what you mean.
[75:03.55]I'm so hungry.
[75:04.15]I need a big burger.
[75:05.07]Cut his mic.
[75:05.37]No, keep it on.
[75:06.11]Okay.
[75:06.79]Wait till the copter lands and then grab fuel rod.
[75:32.91]Stop doing the burger funny thing.
[75:34.31]We did that already.
[75:35.39]You're scaring away new viewers.
[75:36.71]47 seconds.
[75:52.30]Reap what you sow.
[75:54.24]Yeah, and I... Yes, I did.
[75:56.46]I reaped what I sowed.
[75:59.11]I pulled the plant up, we've cultivated it, and it's gone now.
[76:13.69]I planted those seeds, and then the harvest came, and we harvested that joke, and now it's done.
[76:25.21]I'm not even fucking there.
[76:33.22]That doesn't count?
[76:44.04]Can't just smoke the jokes without sharing, bro.
[76:56.28]We gotta just bunny hop.
[77:14.88]It's wasting time.
[77:15.92]Just do this.
[77:16.46]Only this.
[77:20.28]Okay.
[77:25.02]I made up so much more time there.
[77:26.39]Alright, I made it.
[77:29.95]Helicopter coming in.
[77:35.85]Punch helicopter.
[77:37.45]Good.
[77:44.80]Hey, destroy a helicopter.
[77:46.80]He's going fast.
[77:59.52]What the fuck?
[78:01.42]Huh?
[78:06.19]I don't understand.
[78:07.15]There's a jet flying around the buildings.
[78:13.30]What in the name of God?
[78:18.66]How did it even get over there?
[78:19.88]Come here.
[78:26.74]Ugh.
[78:27.42]Ugh.
[78:48.89]Come over here!

[78:56.67]Got him.
[78:57.27]Alright, now... Um...
[79:18.56]Thanks for giving me any time at all to even figure out what the hell was happening.
[79:26.78]Just beat these guys up.
[79:27.62]You know what I mean?
[79:29.15]Just beat them up.
[79:29.77]I don't have a time limit.
[79:32.55]This guy's going to follow me the fuck around forever.
[79:35.67]I don't take... No, don't do an elbow drop.
[79:48.38]I can't... I have to... Fucking Naoto!
[80:01.79]This is really... This is like... Fighting with like... This is fighting with Hulk hands with like your little brother, you know what I mean?

[80:32.83]I'm so bad.
[80:33.71]Oh, no.
[80:34.73]He's just so good.
[80:35.71]I can't keep this.
[80:37.05]Alright, humiliate him.
[80:40.17]Ooh, 10,000 smash points.
[80:51.88]Okay, now I'm ready.
[80:56.05]Wait, I'm inside the building.
[81:03.69]Oh, I got another 10,000 smash points.
[81:06.48]I meant to do that.
[81:09.66]Oh shit, I didn't get it.
[81:16.55]No!
[81:17.37]How do I get it?
[81:18.39]I have to... Oh, you think so?
[81:22.69]You think you're in control?

[82:38.73]Where am I?
[82:39.11]This thing's going to crack.
[82:48.84]Pick up the hamburger.
[82:50.06]I'm not going to pick up the fucking hamburger.
[83:25.42]Just missed me, motherfucker.
[83:26.74]Got it.
[83:37.32]15,000 smasher points.
[83:43.38]Be patient.
[83:45.22]We're closer than we've ever been.

[84:48.52]Keep Doc Samson alive.
[84:50.27]What, is he going to be walking around with a briefcase?
[84:52.87]Protect Samson.
[84:59.35]Is he going to be in a car?
[85:00.61]I feel like he's going to be in a limo.
[85:02.41]Right?
[85:02.69]Don't you see that?
[85:03.41]I foresee this guy in a limousine.
[85:04.73]All units be advised to target Samson Leonard J. Nope.
[85:12.60]He's in an SUV.
[85:14.00]Okay.
[85:18.54]Am I in that car?
[85:23.36]He just ran somebody over.
[85:25.16]How is this driving?
[85:35.34]Protect Samson's car.
[85:49.05]From what exactly?
[85:56.97]We couldn't have gotten a better car than this?
[86:03.54]Can't we get like an armored car?
[86:04.82]Why don't we get like a Subaru Outback?
[86:07.72]You think we would get a fucking armored car with like bulletproof glass and... What?
[86:15.92]Oh, the roadblock.
[86:22.58]Alright.
[86:26.87]Go on.
[86:27.13]You go.
[86:27.85]Go.
[86:28.51]Full speed ahead.
[86:32.71]Oh, there's tanks here.
[86:33.45]Never mind.
[86:33.73]Stay there.
[86:35.69]Can I pick up the...
[86:53.91]I can't pick up the debris.
[86:56.81]Try this again.
[87:01.83]Here comes a meltdown mission.
[87:03.21]No, not yet.
[87:08.20]Get the tank grab upgrade.
[87:11.06]I should get all upgrades, guys.
[87:20.57]So, they're looking for suspicious activity.
[87:22.41]So, instead of just driving normally, you decide to run the guy over.
[87:29.13]Why didn't you just, like, just lie to these people?
[87:34.72]Excuse me, sir.
[87:35.84]I'm with Uber Eats.
[87:38.50]Oh, okay.
[87:38.98]Alright, right.
[87:39.38]Go ahead.
[87:41.16]I'm delivering a package.
[87:42.96]I'm working for the post office.
[87:44.72]Oh, okay.
[87:45.04]Alright.
[87:45.48]See you later.
[87:53.78]Package from Uber Eats.
[87:54.96]No, I'm just saying, like, people that deliver stuff.
[88:00.40]Oh, jeez.
[88:02.52]I can't... Oh, that would have been so bad.
[88:04.94]I just dropped a bridge on him.
[88:17.11]Oh.
[88:26.97]Alright, catch him.
[88:27.85]It's because there's a Psycho Chopper.
[88:33.85]Hold on.
[88:34.23]Let me take care of this.
[88:54.82]No.
[88:55.32]Pick it up.
[89:07.44]Help!
[89:08.88]Oh, he's still alive.
[89:22.61]This motherfucker's almost dead.
[89:25.27]Where's this other person?
[89:31.83]Yeah.
[89:38.14]Oh my god.
[89:39.00]Burger.
[89:42.88]Let me have that one.
[89:43.76]Please let me have that one.
[89:44.88]Please.
[89:47.64]I know you guys think of the same thing.
[89:49.42]I know you are.
[89:50.36]Okay.
[89:52.53]Let's block him.
[89:55.49]Wait.
[89:55.73]I'll get in my car.
[89:59.27]We can drive around together.
[90:06.41]Wait.
[90:06.61]Where is it?
[90:09.36]Did I get it?
[90:13.36]The fade away.
[90:23.27]I love doing the fade away.
[90:24.46]It's the best.
[90:25.28]It's the most fun.
[90:38.33]Banner.
[90:39.92]Banner!
[90:41.94]Surrender, Banner.
[90:43.20]Don't go right next to the tank, you idiot.
[90:54.99]Jump.
[90:56.43]And down.
[91:02.97]Oh, he's left.
[91:03.43]He left.
[91:03.71]He left.
[91:03.95]He left.
[91:04.22]He's fine.
[91:21.39]This is a pretty strong car.
[91:23.88]Oh, in front of us.
[91:30.60]Goddammit.
[91:50.87]Hit it.
[91:51.35]Hit him.
[91:55.16]Oh, this is bad.
[91:59.72]Holy shit.
[92:09.37]Oh, I'm dead.
[92:12.65]Oh.
[92:23.97]This one's going to suck.
[92:30.28]I need the tank upgrades.
[92:32.10]Yeah, alright.
[92:33.82]Give it one more go and then I'm going to get the tank upgrade.
[92:36.46]The throw tank.
[92:37.36]Watch that same guy get hit.
[92:58.46]Alright, we gotta make this quick.
[93:00.64]He already left.
[93:01.66]Alright.
[93:06.09]Stay with him the whole time.
[93:06.87]I gotta make it quick.
[93:09.09]Get the fists.
[93:11.07]Stay with him.
[93:11.79]Keep it around at least 80% health if I can.
[93:13.71]I'll try.
[93:14.17]Where we at?
[93:19.65]Right here.
[93:20.71]First block.
[93:23.50]Am I getting ahead of him?
[93:24.54]I'm just gonna get ahead of him.
[93:55.71]What are you even supposed to do?
[93:57.43]Not get hit by a thousand missiles.
[94:07.75]Okay, well... When they fire... 10 million rounds at you... I'm gonna... I'm getting a tank upgrade.
[94:34.37]We tried catching missiles.
[94:35.53]Well, the interesting thing about the catching missile upgrade is you catch one while 60 hit you in the back.
[94:45.00]It's interesting how that works.
[94:46.32]No, don't start that one.
[95:04.44]Alright, I need... I want like 70,000 points.
[95:07.62]Let's do a mission.
[95:14.63]What were you guys still on?
[95:20.87]Get the soldier into the air as many times as possible without letting him touch the ground.
[95:25.77]Alright.
[95:26.95]Let's give it a try.
[95:34.08]can I use grabs can I just throw him up and catch him and throw him up and catch him throw him up and catch him okay juggle the soldier uh wait a minute
[96:13.54]Hold on, I... Is it X and like up or X and... Do it away from him or something, right?
[96:26.37]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:28.67]Okay, I get it.
[96:29.57]So, go like this.
[96:47.12]You gotta hit back and X at the same time.
[96:51.36]Alright, give me a better camera angle.
[96:53.04]This camera is terrible.
[97:03.25]Maybe don't even lock on.
[97:04.49]Should I not lock on?
[97:05.37]No, you have to lock on.
[97:09.42]Ah, shit.
[97:13.40]Block unchanged.
[97:17.33]Give me a 10. 10!
[97:38.50]No!
[97:39.74]12!
[97:41.42]Got it.
[97:41.74]Silver medal.
[97:42.18]I don't care.
[97:42.56]That's fine.
[97:43.00]4,000 points.
[97:46.84]Cool.
[98:04.09]This guy's a silver streamer.
[98:05.33]I'd rather have the silver medal than... Haven't we talked about this?
[98:07.69]How second place is better than first place?
[98:10.73]Because I was very, very good.
[98:12.71]But I don't have to... I don't have to be the best.
[98:15.39]Because then I have a ton of expectations.
[98:17.33]When you get in first place, then all of a sudden, you're the expectation now.
[98:24.62]I don't want first place.
[98:27.34]I want second place.
[98:37.23]In fact, I want, like, fourth place.
[98:40.02]Because you did really good.
[98:41.54]You didn't, like, place, but holy shit, like, how many people were doing that?
[98:45.26]Well, there were, like, 40 people doing that.
[98:47.40]I got to, like, eighth place?
[98:50.46]That's fucking kind of high.
[98:51.63]That's pretty good.
[98:58.91]Okay, use your club to hit the soldier as far as possible.
[99:01.13]Charge the attack to increase the distance.
[99:02.84]See how far you can hit the soldier.
[99:08.62]And by the way, fourth place is placing if you go by Super Nintendo Mario Kart standards.
[99:15.76]And that's the standards that I go by.
[99:26.07]Jesus.
[99:29.17]Alright, I can do like 500 yards.
[99:30.61]Alright.
[99:31.03]No, no, no, no, no.
[99:34.79]Okay, alright.
[99:35.11]This is fun.
[99:35.91]This is fun.
[99:38.82]You got to get a full charge.
[99:44.02]Oh, I got it.
[99:45.56]Could have done it a little earlier.
[99:46.82]279.
[99:48.83]Oh.
[99:55.73]You got to get under it.
[99:57.31]That was alright.
[100:02.74]That was pretty good.
[100:03.50]300. 300.
[100:10.95]I got under it.
[100:11.45]284, come on.
[100:21.19]295, 300, get it.
[100:26.64]Jump and do it.
[100:29.54]I threw it.
[100:33.40]That's me.
[100:36.56]That guy just died for no reason.
[100:41.67]It doesn't work like that.
[100:42.63]No, I'm hitting the... Ow, my chest.
[100:56.08]They all are dying for no reason.
[100:59.26]I know, I know, I know, but... Wait, let me try Y.
[101:08.33]That's definitely over 300 yards.
[101:10.23]Holy shit, that's like 400.
[101:16.92]It's Y, not X. Get one more.
[101:20.16]I'm gonna do this one again.
[101:20.76]I can give... I definitely can do it.
[101:24.85]They all are dying for no reason.
[101:26.81]I know.
[101:42.15]Let's go like this.
[101:47.03]It's a lot longer.
[101:52.01]Come on.
[101:52.27]Come on.
[101:54.94]Go away.
[101:55.20]400.
[102:01.20]Oh, I got him right in the toe.
[102:03.38]I got way underneath him.
[102:04.72]That's probably going to be pretty good.
[102:11.58]Come on, that was perfect.
[102:18.08]Alright, X and Y.
[102:46.45]That didn't work.
[102:47.17]I'm just making him fall faster Hold on wait wait wait

[103:40.19]One more after this.
[103:40.69]I gotta get to 400.
[103:41.17]That would have been it.

[103:48.21]Knock him in the air, then do it?
[103:51.35]Wait.
[103:52.15]Hold on.
[103:53.34]Hold on a second.

[104:09.97]You'd be bad at baseball.

[127:45.42]You can go now.
[127:54.79]Wait for me to get out of the way first.
[127:56.03]Fucking idiot.
[128:11.55]He is an idiot, alright?
[128:12.93]He's an idiot.
[128:16.22]What do you want me to say?
[128:16.96]He's not an idiot?
[128:18.90]That what he was doing right there was smart?
[128:21.42]You want me to not call the guy driving on the sidewalk an idiot?
[128:25.08]Look at this.
[128:25.42]This guy's being controlled remotely by a shitty Wi-Fi signal.
[128:37.55]Nobody even in that fucking car.
[128:44.79]Holy shit.
[128:48.03]What?
[128:48.83]Why am I taking damage?
[128:52.51]Oh, whoa.

[129:11.28]Oh.
[129:17.21]Okay, here they come.
[129:19.40]Come on, show up.
[129:37.31]The Yeti's coming out.
[129:38.19]I don't know what she meant to say, but... Fire is releasing.
[129:56.22]Ow.
[129:58.28]Alright, throw it at somebody else.
[130:03.70]Thank god it worked.
[130:06.70]Why are people saying F?
[130:10.90]Or F. I got zero drop frames.
[130:14.59]Why are you guys doing this to me?
[130:29.87]Don't tell him.
[130:30.41]Because you threw a tank at somebody.
[130:32.01]Oh.
[130:32.85]Why is it that I automatically just assume that F means your internet's not working and your stream is dead?
[130:38.35]I think I'm just so fucked up from having so many internet problems that I see F, F, F. And I'm like, oh shit, it's over.
[130:44.26]The stream's turned off.
[130:45.90]The stream's off.
[130:50.00]I'm so traumatized.
[131:00.76]Alright, let's go.
[131:11.77]Pick him up and flick him.
[131:16.99]Ah, there it is.
[131:17.49]See you later.
[131:18.85]Not over.
[131:22.72]Wait.
[131:23.52]Aww.
[131:29.47]When are we gonna reach our destination?
[131:36.01]Can we get there?
[131:36.61]This guy's taking the shittiest route possible.
[131:39.44]Watch this!
[131:44.60]Had a bolt.
[131:46.94]Why is this guy driving around like this?
[131:55.67]Come here.
[131:56.41]One of you.
[132:07.18]I'm catching this.
[132:15.90]He got one off at the end.

[132:20.78]Dermot, your mic.
[132:21.38]Dermot, your mic.

[133:09.45]Go, go, please don't get killed.
[133:12.05]It's the same shit that happened last time.
[133:22.58]What?
[133:23.24]Ah, give me health, please.
[133:30.63]Holy fuck, I did it.
[133:31.63]That was horrible.
[133:47.28]The Blonsky file.
[133:50.70]Big zip, man, you been stressed?
[133:54.03]No, no, not at all.
[133:55.61]Not at all.
[133:58.43]My dog was just in the hospital last week.
[134:02.11]Had to move during a global pandemic.
[134:05.85]It hadn't been any stress in my life.
[134:17.64]Play Cities Skylines.
[134:21.77]Cry.
[134:22.33]Hey!
[134:23.91]Hey!
[134:24.35]Hold on.
[134:25.03]Hey!
[134:26.99]That was like a radio kind of YouTuber.
[134:28.93]Hey My other voice
[134:48.88]You're at the peak of your power.
[134:50.32]Well, not yet.
[134:51.58]Not yet.
[134:54.29]Why does he sound like that?
[134:55.43]I don't want to do the BB unit thing.
[135:11.33]But I will because I like it.
[135:13.10]It's fun.
[135:13.90]I might just do it.
[135:14.72]I'm thinking about it.
[135:30.77]Alright, this is called My Other Voice.
[135:32.95]You're doing well, Bruce.
[135:33.99]Everything's coming to fruition.
[135:35.81]Now, I need you to strike at their heart.
[135:38.51]The division has set up a front in the financial district and they're spreading their poison in plain sight.
[135:44.60]We can't allow them a foothold there.
[135:47.02]What about civilians?
[135:48.36]There are no civilians in that vicinity anymore.
[135:50.78]It's just you versus them.
[136:11.02]Alright, I'm gonna... Defeat division forces!
[136:23.23]Destroy the fuel depot.
[136:27.57]Destroy everything, Bruce.
[136:40.94]Guys, remember when Jerma gave Outer Wilds a 7 out of 10?
[136:44.72]Well, that's unfortunately untrue.
[136:46.14]I don't know why it's unfortunately untrue, but it's not true.
[137:34.23]I feel like I just opened up Gmod and just spawned 10 of every enemy and just put them all hostile versus each other.
[137:44.60]You know when you do that shit?
[137:52.47]Let's see what happens with the total fucking carnage.
[137:59.37]Oh dude, I wonder what happens when seven guys in suits fight 20 helicopters.
[138:08.74]This would be interesting.
[138:11.02]And you forget about the tank that you spawned and it's just kind of there.
[138:13.56]Oh yeah, I did spawn a tank.
[138:16.12]Fuck, I'm gonna have to do this again.
[138:17.16]That's a bad variable.
[138:19.42]This is not a good indicator.
[138:20.32]I'm gonna have to do it after the tank is gone.
[138:37.42]There's just too many of them.
[138:56.31]I really did just give that guy a diamond cutter.
[138:58.41]That's an RKO, yeah.
[138:59.77]Alright, you guys...
[139:08.73]How many of you guys remember, I remember being on a trampoline and having, there were these little WrestleBuddy things that they were, they were like two feet tall and they were stuffed animal kind of things.
[139:20.46]It was like, oh, Ted DiBiase and the Ultimate Warrior.
[139:24.54]And I used to just do wrestling moves to these guys.
[139:26.62]You were supposed to, that wasn't a commercial and shit.
[139:29.20]I would do wrestling moves to them on trampoline.
[139:32.76]We would go over to friends' houses and be like, oh, let's do wrestling moves!
[139:35.66]And we would do shit like that.
[139:38.08]We'd pick them up and give them, like, stunners!
[139:41.32]DDT!
[139:41.58]Okay.
[139:44.22]Fucking exploded.
[139:57.43]Kai, please, I need your help.
[139:58.61]I need his help.
[140:00.81]Explode so I can get the fucking health.
[140:11.92]Shield, please.
[140:14.00]Oh my god.
[140:15.26]You... Are you fucking kidding me?
[140:35.60]Run!
[140:42.98]Did I get him?
[141:07.97]Ah, okay Run
[141:51.52]Relentless!
[141:52.86]Oh!
[141:56.62]Oh, I want a coin!
[142:09.19]Why is this guy lit up?
[142:18.94]Is he dead?
[142:19.66]I'm here, you little fuck.
[142:34.69]It never stopped.
[142:35.31]It never stopped.
[142:37.45]Shit never stopped.
[142:52.01]This is a fucking headache mission.
[143:12.23]This whole game is a headache?
[143:14.89]Yeah, I agree.
[143:31.38]Am I going to regen yet?
[143:32.28]What the fuck?
[143:34.14]I'm going to die.
[143:37.03]Probably.
[143:37.95]It's just never ending insta 50,000 mile per hour helicopters just grind into buildings and into walls and shit.
[143:46.25]Hey, look at this.
[143:47.49]I don't know what I'm looking at.
[144:01.89]You kids beat this?
[144:03.85]Yeah, because they put it on easy and they probably... No, they didn't.
[144:07.01]Bullshit.
[144:08.97]They played on easy the first three levels and moved on to something else because kids have the attention spans of fucking squirrels.
[144:16.13]Okay?
[144:17.23]That's incorrect.
[144:22.39]I beat this game when I was a kid.
[144:23.56]No, you beat the first level on easy and then you forgot it existed and then your mother brought it to like a donation box.
[144:29.72]That's probably what happened.
[144:32.57]Or you sold it?
[144:33.62]Or do you feel like dad sold it?
[144:42.28]He forgot about it.
[144:56.57]And then 30 years later, you ask your mom, hey, mom!
[145:01.72]What happened to that?
[145:02.34]Wasn't there a Hulk game that we had before?
[145:05.14]Oh, yeah.
[145:05.66]I have no idea what happened to that.
[145:08.24]You stopped playing that after 10 minutes, honey.
[145:11.00]Oh, really?
[145:11.42]Because I keep telling the streamer on Twitch that, like, I beat every game he ever plays.
[145:15.63]And I just want to, like, make sure that, like, I have save files still so I can, like, fucking take a screenshot of the save file when I got to the end of the fucking game.
[145:21.79]And I'm going to have a screenshot that says 2004, 4, 6, 06 p.m.
[145:27.32]And it's going to be the final edition of the save file.
[145:29.16]We don't have that?
[145:33.24]No honey, we don't!
[145:34.48]I need help!
[145:50.09]This is what it feels like!
[145:51.37]To just put like a paper bag on your head!
[145:54.10]And just run around your room into fucking walls!
[145:59.32]It's the same thing!
[146:08.33]You don't even know what's happening I'm on like a shitload of drugs running around with like a bag on my head or something I have like a blindfold on on a bunch of fucking crack Circling the same room And this is what's going on in my head
[146:36.11]There's mutants and aliens everywhere!
[146:38.09]Oh shit, we're under attack!
[146:50.76]I did catch this banner!
[146:52.36]Fuck you!
[147:01.63]I did it!
[147:14.98]Oh my god!
[147:16.66]Should've elbow-dropped him, not today!
[147:26.30]Wait, that's not it.
[147:41.33]Destroy all Hulkbusters!
[147:53.57]His butt.
[147:54.17]And then stomp him.
[148:05.37]Go juggle.
[148:06.49]And then he explodes.
[148:07.87]And then we get health.
[148:09.21]One.
[148:09.63]What's it called?
[148:12.13]Busters?
[148:13.87]Down.
[148:17.08]Coin.
[148:26.44]Hunk Buster?
[148:27.56]No, it's Hunk Buster.
[148:30.08]One Hunk Buster.
[148:31.60]The Incredible Hunk.
[148:35.39]That's definitely the name of... That's the title of the porn.
[148:38.83]It has to be.
[148:40.41]It has to be.
[148:44.11]This guy just painted green.
[148:57.47]There's definitely like painted green like fucking like I Don't know it's like party store makeup It's just like streaks all over them.
[149:20.35]They don't give a fuck.
[149:21.16]I didn't try I
[149:36.33]Like a third of the guy's back ain't even green.
[149:47.35]The Hulk Halloween costume.
[149:49.60]Yeah, but the Hulk mask on.
[149:58.42]Oh yeah, we're talking about one of those plastic Hulk masks.
[150:02.70]The ones that just barely cover the front of your face.
[150:06.71]and aren't sized properly so sometimes your face might be a little too big and your real chin, cheeks and forehead bleed out on the edges.
[150:15.16]I think I caught one.
[150:28.75]Of course there's a huge one!
[150:32.25]Of course there's a big-ass Hulkbuster!
[150:37.84]No, fry him!
[150:42.77]Punch him in the fucking head!
[150:45.89]Ugh!
[150:47.31]You can do any damage with that.
[151:06.52]Oh, there's another one here.
[151:18.55]I can't even.
[151:25.25]I can't even see.
[151:27.29]I'm going to run this way for a minute.
[151:31.39]Oh my god, I literally can't even.
[151:34.59]No, I can't.
[151:36.46]Even.
[151:39.42]Start crying, Jupiter.
[151:58.04]break this building.
[151:59.46]How am I supposed to destroy this?
[152:01.74]Okay, I thought my head just got fucking splattered on the back of that.
[152:06.16]Did you see how fucked up that looked?
[152:28.31]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[152:34.89]I gotta get the fuck out of here.

[154:32.52]There's no way.
[154:34.04]There's no way.
[154:35.84]You would die like five times to that without even the amount of running that I'm doing.
[154:55.50]This is not even the incredible Hulk.
[155:01.22]What does that have to do with Hulk?
[155:19.03]It's so fucking funny.
[155:23.15]So how, how do you want me to, alright, uh, all you guys, how do you want me to do this one?

[155:45.34]This is very funny.
[155:51.40]Okay, stop throwing.
[155:52.66]Okay, I know you're fucking kidding, but imagine thinking at the extreme, extreme I was trying to keep myself alive.
[156:02.27]Imagine thinking the guy is throwing.

[163:25.52]What's that?
[163:27.90]Okay, that's a streetlight.
[163:28.74]I thought it was like a jet.
[163:37.96]Goodbye.
[163:45.57]Good.
[163:46.41]Are they both dead, right?
[163:47.09]Yep.
[163:47.27]Alright, keep going.
[163:47.87]I want more, uh... I want my shield back.
[164:00.09]Let's go.
[164:00.66]Here we go.
[164:07.44]Ah, that's a fun move to do.
[164:14.55]Good.
[164:16.97]Get those fists.
[164:22.20]Where the fuck are the jukes?
[164:23.12]Where are the jukes?
[164:26.08]They're everywhere, man.
[164:43.39]Nope.
[164:44.33]Don't think so.
[164:47.85]Right into my hands.
[164:48.49]Right into my hands.
[164:49.03]Right into my hands.
[164:49.61]Right into my hands.
[164:50.63]Throw him in the fucking ocean.
[164:52.93]No.
[164:53.01]Give him another DDT.
[164:54.50]Or a Bulldog.
[165:03.45]find yourself unable to cast sus the stream is live yes it is currently it is yeah it is
[165:22.32]I love to do the fade away.
[165:24.72]You know, when I used to play basketball games, if I played an NBA game, it didn't matter if the shot was very easy.
[165:30.81]I would always jump backwards and fade away and shoot every single time.
[165:34.31]It just was so satisfying.
[165:41.86]Everything about it.
[165:42.42]Alright, here we go.
[165:47.06]There's the building.
[165:57.42]Holy shit.
[165:57.83]I thought objects in the mirror are way huger than they appear in front of you.
[166:01.39]What?
[166:01.67]I thought these were small.
[166:02.65]I thought they were the little ones.
[166:04.23]It's two huge ones.
[166:11.82]Get it.
[166:12.02]I got it.
[166:12.44]Get it.
[166:23.60]Holy shit.
[166:28.18]We got a fire.
[166:35.57]I'm just annoying.
[166:41.83]Wouldn't that be hurting me?
[166:43.09]Wait, wait, wait.
[166:45.18]Frank, stop.
[166:45.88]Frank, stop attacking.
[166:46.58]He's hitting his fucking head into the metal.
[166:48.86]Over and over again.
[166:49.54]He's just gonna die.
[166:50.46]Let him do it.
[167:05.03]Alright, this is bad.
[167:05.85]I gotta run.
[167:10.20]Yeah, I should've ran.
[167:31.27]I'm regenerating.
[167:39.79]That's a good thing, so I can get help for you.
[167:41.29]Alright, here we go.
[167:45.17]Fight!
[167:58.97]I need that.
[168:00.33]I need that.
[168:00.97]I need that.
[168:01.59]I need that.
[168:22.99]I can't go back there.
[168:29.19]What's even happening?
[168:29.93]I have no idea.
[168:31.45]It's almost impossible to tell.
[168:34.59]75% of the fights in this game.
[168:36.24]What is even happening on the screen?
[168:38.74]I'm there with you.
[168:39.42]I have no idea.
[168:51.12]Where the...
[168:59.52]Because I have to keep running away and I keep grabbing more of these fucking guys It's like I know it's I I can't beat it down there's like 30 people following me I
[169:27.38]I need to regenerate health, kill one of these guys.
[169:32.10]I can't even grab anything because I keep blowing it up before I can get it.
[169:56.89]Open the objective?
[169:58.63]Well, they're gonna, this is gonna, they'll never stop fucking following me.
[170:02.97]He's gonna drop health.
[170:07.53]Give me, uh, search.
[170:09.67]He's not dead.
[170:13.89]Yes, he is.
[170:14.52]Oh, I'm dead.
[170:15.36]Play the objective.
[170:16.88]I have to, guys, I have to destroy the building and there's ten people following me.
[170:28.31]Running away makes you run into more guys.
[170:29.81]Yeah, but when the... Okay, so the two huge guys that were attacking me that I couldn't kill... Should I let them kill me on the bridge?
[170:36.21]Or try to fight for my goddamn life?
[170:39.21]Should I just let them kill me on the bridge?
[170:41.87]Um, what are you... What are you doing there?
[171:03.03]Fuck both of you.
[171:03.61]Can I buy something new?
[171:07.55]Yeah, I definitely can buy.
[171:09.25]I'm going to get the health upgrade.
[171:19.14]And also, it's kind of hard to tell what direction I'm even facing.
[171:21.98]I was like, dude, why are you running away?
[171:23.68]I'm not even trying to.
[171:24.84]It's just... The game is flashing my life before my eyes.
[171:34.88]It's like if in Overwatch, everybody's four moves they had were all ultimates.
[171:47.73]Oh, itchy eye.
[172:12.93]Where's my tracer?
[172:21.81]Wait, did they make a tracer pop?
[172:31.65]They did.
[172:32.79]But why don't I have one?
[172:43.42]Don't aggro anybody.
[172:44.68]Alright, what's the... Oh my god.
[172:50.95]I need to get those dumb checkpoints too.
[172:54.33]I'm just gonna fly above the city.
[172:57.21]I'm not gonna aggro anybody.
[172:58.85]I'm just gonna fly above.
[173:00.09]I'm gonna hide.
[173:00.73]I'm gonna do sneaking from the top.
[173:03.23]So just sneak.
[173:05.65]Nobody will see me.
[173:07.57]See?
[173:09.21]No one's even spawning.
[173:10.43]I'm breaking the game's spawn rate.
[173:12.61]Nothing can spawn up here because the game prioritizes frame rate, right?
[173:16.66]So if it spawned a shitload of things right now, the game would break.
[173:28.13]See?
[173:28.91]I land for a second and there's a guy right there.
[173:33.77]Dead.
[173:34.07]And dead.
[173:35.97]Okay, here we go.
[173:39.47]Can I just beat the shit out of these two guys?
[174:04.96]Should I race to the objective?
[174:06.12]Should I try to spy cap this?
[174:10.74]Alright, I'm going to try.
[174:12.15]I'm going to spy cap this mission.
[174:15.09]That was a nice TF2 reference.
[174:36.91]Alright, land.
[174:37.79]Let's do it twice.
[174:47.93]Do it again.
[174:53.06]What just fucking happened?
[175:07.34]Alright Help right there
[175:34.00]I don't even have water in the engine.
[175:59.28]God damn it!
[176:02.52]Don't aggro the other guy.
[176:03.48]I'm trying not to.
[176:04.52]Are they smart enough?
[176:14.27]I'm going to aggro the other guy, aren't I?
[176:19.47]Do a move.
[176:36.34]Okay, stay back here.
[176:38.52]I gotta be careful.
[176:39.24]Go the other way.
[176:39.72]Go the other way.
[176:40.44]Watch this.
[176:43.10]Don't aggro anybody.
[176:44.32]Check this out.
[176:46.53]Oh, you fucking piece of shit.
[176:48.33]Give me a break.
[176:49.07]It's gonna work.
[176:52.17]I got another guy here, too.
[177:12.66]Where the fuck did this guy even come from, man?
[177:15.52]What the fuck?
[177:16.92]There's no strategy here.
[177:20.44]There's no fucking strategy.
[177:32.98]It's just a mess.
[177:37.94]I have to buy the health upgrade.
[177:46.47]There's no way.
[177:53.80]Unfortunately, we have to do that whole stupid goddamn mission again.
[178:03.20]But we'll have more health when we do it.
[178:04.66]Oh, I can assure you.
[178:06.16]Where is it?
[178:18.39]Okay.
[178:19.97]Thank you.
[178:21.29]Thanks for the health.
[178:22.99]Double air dash.
[178:23.87]This is very fucking important too.
[178:25.48]Got that one.
[178:27.02]Okay.
[178:28.60]Let's go.
[178:47.55]Just ignore the bridge?
[178:49.47]Yeah, but I have to kill all the Hulkbusters.
[178:53.22]I have to kill the Hulkbusters.
[178:54.24]That's part of the mission.
[178:55.02]Part of the mission is destroy all Hulkbusters.
[179:03.78]Okay.
[179:15.64]Dashing twice will probably help a lot.
[179:19.65]That second one doesn't feel as powerful.
[179:21.29]Do I like this game?
[179:27.58]Yeah.
[179:29.14]I do.
[179:53.68]His Kappa faces.
[179:55.62]No, I do.
[179:56.64]I do like this game.
[179:57.75]I do.
[179:58.03]Otherwise, I wouldn't be playing it two days in a row.
[179:59.65]Okay, let's try this again.
[180:02.87]More health.
[180:22.28]Get the jump checkpoint?
[180:24.53]Ah, fuck.
[180:26.85]It's okay.
[180:28.03]7 out of 10.
[180:28.47]Where's the jump point?
[180:29.45]Somebody spread it.
[180:42.29]Alright, let's try this.
[180:43.27]I'm going for it.
[180:44.00]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[180:45.42]Alright, quiet time.
[180:47.82]Trying to be quiet.
[180:49.20]It's time to not talk about how much I hate this game.
[181:46.60]How the fuck are these missing?
[181:56.69]Be aggressive.
[181:58.05]That's all you can do.
[181:59.35]I'm just spamming.
[182:00.61]I'm not like you.
[182:05.19]Well, let me detect it.
[182:05.99]Let me think about this.
[182:06.81]I'm the Incredible Hulk.
[182:08.13]Let me play my chess.
[182:17.69]I'm supposed to be quiet.
[182:18.41]I'm supposed to be quiet.
[182:19.51]I'm supposed to be being quiet.
[182:21.61]I'm supposed to be being quiet.
[182:35.66]Yeah, you walked right into it, stupid.
[182:46.84]Here we go.
[182:58.67]Go.
[183:02.57]More aggressive.
[183:03.45]More aggressive.
[183:03.97]Be more aggressive.
[183:04.79]I think the GameCube version had better frame rate.
[183:17.42]Did it?
[183:19.22]I have a feeling every game, every one of these had probably bad frame rate.
[183:26.99]It's kinda hard to have a good frame rate.
[183:32.37]When there's all this shit going on.
[183:37.39]Where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he?
[183:49.22]Fuck outta here, let's go.
[183:50.00]It's cause you're on 723.
[183:52.12]Turn it down to 480i.
[183:53.62]I don't think I can handle that.
[184:01.55]I don't think I really could do that.
[184:05.76]Pretend you're fighting chat.
[184:09.48]Okay.
[184:39.48]Fuck you, ow, hey!
[184:42.78]Ouch, you're hurting me.
[184:48.12]Ouch, you're hurting me.
[184:49.30]Ow, ow.
[184:52.35]Stop.
[185:02.57]That hurt?
[185:05.49]Fist.
[185:06.09]Come on, chat.
[185:18.07]Kick his ass.
[185:18.71]Come on, let's go.
[185:20.81]Come on.
[185:38.08]Get off me!
[185:42.18]Pick him up and throw-
[186:06.50]Why do they keep spawning?
[186:10.86]Ugh.
[186:13.62]Aggravating.
[186:19.60]Here we go.
[186:30.26]Just the first, uh, hunkbuster.
[186:33.40]Get down here.
[186:36.20]Ask and you shall receive, Jeremy!
[186:45.74]These guys are so hard to deal with.
[186:59.46]Especially when there's all these other little shits just fucking spamming around you in circles.
[187:14.42]bro shit at him?
[187:15.40]Oh, I would love to.
[187:17.40]If it wasn't the ship just spamming in every direction.
[187:27.57]You're fighting a raid boss.
[187:28.67]I am a raid boss, too.
[187:31.62]I can't use that term.
[187:46.99]They really liked the missiles.
[187:48.29]When they were making this game, they were like, you know what?
[187:50.17]The missiles are the best part of the whole game.
[187:52.29]Just do more of those.
[187:54.48]More of those.
[187:55.02]Excuse me, guys.
[188:04.24]I'm not seeing at least 50 missiles every one minute on screen.
[188:07.48]What do you think this is?
[188:25.99]How are we supposed to determine if Hulk is powerful if he doesn't get hit with a hundred long-range missiles every second?
[188:33.25]People won't even know he's powerful!
[188:34.67]They won't even know he's strong!
[188:48.24]He's mad.
[188:51.70]Here comes another one.
[188:53.10]Let's go.
[189:00.15]Hulk is stupid, but he's strong.
[189:06.64]That's alright.
[189:08.32]He adds a lot to the Avengers.
[189:17.14]he added a shitload to the Avengers he was like he was not even the strongest avenger but alright not the smartest avenger but okay not the coolest powers of all the Avengers oh alright it's green
[189:57.10]Angry, angry, angry.
[190:08.63]Fucking thing down.
[190:18.65]Dude, you grabbed me after the buzzer.
[190:19.81]That's a bunch of penalties.
[190:20.77]That's fine.
[190:21.13]Do it.
[190:22.03]When the match is over, I will win because you're going to get a shitload of penalties.
[190:24.62]You're going to get disqualified.
[190:26.72]Ref, I'm not doing anything.
[190:28.20]Ref.
[190:29.58]I'm not doing shit.
[190:30.81]Thank you.
[190:47.16]Alright, this is where I got left off before.
[190:49.38]This is important.
[190:49.98]This is the one.
[190:50.52]This is the important mission.
[191:04.74]Just flatten.
[191:06.20]These guys are really susceptible to the fucking flatten.
[191:11.13]They really are.
[191:16.01]Get a shield and then just hit Y and flatten.
[191:18.47]Over and over again.
[191:29.04]Just got me.
[191:30.82]That just got me, Odell.
[191:36.58]Why did you write that?
[191:38.63]If you write that, that means I have to say it.
[191:41.01]What did you say that for?
[191:53.66]Did I take it out of my hands?
[191:54.62]What just happened to that thing?
[192:03.15]Oh, shit.
[192:09.07]Oh, the tip of that Jess got me right there.
[192:17.28]Folks, right now... No, why are you doing this to me?
[192:21.92]We made it easy.
[192:23.66]Do emergency surgery in the studio.
[192:26.76]I don't want to do these things.
[192:37.01]If they happen, I'll bring them up.
[192:42.77]Thanks.
[192:57.46]Alright, we're almost there.
[193:10.93]So, the strategy is to go across the water.
[193:13.45]No, there is no go across the water.
[193:15.10]There's no go across the water.
[193:18.94]Guys, look.
[193:20.10]Destroy all Hulkbusters.
[193:21.84]They have to die.
[193:22.52]They have to die.
[193:35.09]Jerma's giving out free trailers.
[193:39.43]I need a new trailer.
[193:43.22]I need, I just put that on my expenses.
[193:45.44]I just put that on my expenses.
[193:47.42]I'll put that on my expenses.
[193:49.76]I'll put that on my expenses.
[193:51.29]I'll put that on my expenses.
[194:08.76]Alright, I can fucking take him.
[194:10.48]Look around.
[194:22.01]That went much cleaner.
[194:23.15]Here we go, let's try this tactic.
[194:38.34]No, wait, don't worry.
[194:41.56]There's an invisible wall.
[194:44.82]Staff are asking for a raise.
[194:46.14]There's an invisible wall.
[194:54.21]Why wouldn't there be an invisible wall?
[195:09.07]Hi.
[195:10.09]What?
[195:10.81]What?
[195:11.87]What?
[195:12.99]What?
[195:13.91]What?
[195:14.95]What?
[195:15.39]Now we just have to kill two huge guys at the same time.
[195:18.27]One of your staff just died.
[195:24.97]Guy just got destroyed.
[195:31.57]Good.
[195:31.93]Okay.
[195:32.33]Here we go.
[195:33.86]I have to win.
[195:37.72]I gotta win.
[195:38.70]I've gotta kill both these guys at the same time.. I've got two stomps.
[195:45.24]Don't waste critical mass.
[195:47.05]How should I be using it?
[195:52.43]Critical atomic slam.
[196:06.16]Do I have any other moves?
[196:09.26]I can use it?
[196:09.82]That's the only move I can do with Critical Mass, right?
[196:24.75]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[196:48.32]Fuck, I'm trying to grab.
[196:49.86]Grab one at least!
[196:50.82]Grab one at least!
[196:53.24]Get him!
[197:08.53]It actually kind of is.
[197:09.63]Like, how the fuck do you fight these two guys at the same fucking time?
[197:42.91]what that's not working that don't work
[197:52.46]Where the fuck did you come from?
[197:54.34]Actually, I need you.
[197:55.12]Come here.
[198:04.68]I need his help.
[198:06.17]I need your help.
[198:08.09]There it is.
[198:12.39]They flattened you.
[198:13.79]Yes, they do.
[198:14.39]I almost got one.
[198:19.59]One's almost done.
[198:27.10]One's dead.
[198:27.46]One's dead.
[198:27.80]I got one.
[198:36.84]Why are you not dead?
[198:46.59]No, jump.
[198:52.93]Xbox turret off.
[198:54.43]That's not going to work.
[198:57.88]Xbox, turn it off.
[198:59.12]Xbox, go to sleep.
[199:02.06]That was so stupid.
[199:23.00]elbow drops to the wind there it is alright dead finally oh my god I was getting so mad I was getting so angry so pissed off destroy the armory
[199:53.95]Alright, it's time for a critical mass.
[200:06.40]Alright, let me do the...
[200:24.20]Is there any more to do?
[200:25.70]That was a long, horrible mission.
[200:27.30]I don't want to do that one again.
[200:28.70]Fuck, I said it again.
[200:33.43]Title of this video.
[200:34.09]Ultimate Destruction.
[200:34.73]I don't want to do that one again.
[200:35.71]Yes.
[200:35.85]Yes, it can be a blessing if I choose it to be.
[200:54.69]You're addicted to the power.
[201:00.35]You're becoming an abomination.
[201:03.68]What did you say?
[201:04.86]It's not like that.
[201:06.70]I promise.
[201:07.92]Now I'm gonna use that name.
[201:08.92]I'm not afraid of the mutation anymore.
[201:11.58]Not when I have this kind of power.
[201:20.60]turned on his voice changer he's streaming right now and people think it's funny when he does when he does Bugleberry alright is there a jump pod over here somewhere there probably is
[201:53.33]We all know, we all know you can do moves, you're very good at them, but I don't need to.
[201:57.58]There's probably a jump here.
[202:03.46]The next mission is the final mission.
[202:06.09]What?
[202:06.37]Is it actually?
[202:16.85]No, it's not.
[202:17.75]We haven't even fought Abomination.
[202:27.78]Alright, where's the jump pod?
[202:37.34]I'm so sick of you fucking guys.
[202:46.29]Follow me the fuck around everywhere I go.
[202:48.10]Can you just leave me the fuck alone?
[202:58.08]Ever.
[202:58.20]Or do I have to constantly fucking, constantly just be running the fuck away from you?
[203:04.37]Just leave me alone!
[203:08.97]Why is the aggro range infinite on these guys?
[203:11.21]It shouldn't be like that.
[203:12.23]It shouldn't be like that.
[203:14.47]Bleh!
[203:18.21]F, F, F, F. That was a real F. Uh-oh.
[203:24.75]That was a real one.
[203:27.47]Oh, shit.
[203:29.65]That was a real one.
[203:31.86]Uh-oh.
[203:34.62]Uh-oh.
[203:37.54]No, don't worry.
[203:44.24]It's perfectly normal.
[203:47.03]That's perfectly normal.
[203:47.89]That's perfectly fine.
[203:49.79]That's completely normal.
[203:50.79]I'll tell you what.
[203:52.53]That might be freaking out about... I dropped 300 frames.
[203:56.66]As you know, on a typical stream, a typical stream that's between 4 to 7, like 5 to 6 hours long, drops about 1,000 frames.
[204:03.08]Maybe like 600 to 1,000.
[204:03.80]That's pretty typical.
[204:09.57]But also keep this in mind as well.
[204:11.51]I'm also streaming through a VPN.
[204:13.71]So I'm not getting the full power of the fiber because I'm going through a VPN.
[204:24.30]Why am I doing that?
[204:24.94]Because I want to.
[204:27.44]No, it is not the one.
[204:30.64]It's not that one.
[204:31.60]It's not that one.
[204:32.46]It's not that one.
[204:33.30]I don't know because it...
[204:39.85]I don't just want to die.
[204:41.85]What are you talking about?
[204:50.19]Well, don't act like I didn't buy a service and pay for the year four months ago or so and moved and don't need it anymore.
[205:01.26]You don't think I'm going to get my money's worth and continue to use the privacy and the potential routing of a VPN provider?
[205:12.40]I'm going to let this thing run out.
[205:13.30]Alright.
[205:24.36]Critical Thunderclap.
[205:28.30]I feel like, wait, are there any important moves?
[205:34.39]Critical Pain.
[205:37.65]It delivers a huge deal of damage to a single foe.
[205:46.34]critical pain what is it max x and then hold on how do you press that on Xbox with your max x plus b do I have to hold like my thumb and finger that's kind of a weird combo to press anything else I can't air spike
[206:16.10]Hmm.
[206:17.78]I think I saved the points.
[206:23.20]Good for the big guys?
[206:24.02]Yeah.
[206:26.46]No, I'm still streaming through VPN, so.
[206:35.36]Plus, literally anything less than 1,000 for a full stream is normal.
[206:42.10]Because nothing can ever be perfect.
[206:46.18]No matter how good or how fast or how stable something is.
[206:53.54]Back when there was no internet problems at all, you typically will always drop at least a few hundred frames a stream.
[207:04.09]Don't worry, I'm not alarmed by that.
[207:08.33]We are losing our few remaining chances.
[207:11.57]Our contact in the division has left classified material for me in a box at the army testing facility.
[207:16.89]I don't get it.
[207:17.91]Why there?
[207:18.41]Appraising like fiber was the second coming of Christ.
[207:22.61]Well, yes, because this fiber line is a 1,000-1,000 line for 400% less than what I was paying for a 330 line at the old place.
[207:29.69]So, yeah.
[207:38.01]I am going to talk about it like that.
[207:39.31]This cable sucks.
[207:48.60]Dr. Banner, remain where you are.
[207:51.84]Do not attempt to retreat or we will fire.
[207:56.04]Bruce, this is Len.
[207:57.68]I need you to listen to me.
[207:59.32]I can't protect you anymore.
[208:01.30]We've lost control, both of us.
[208:03.70]If you don't let me help you, you'll destroy yourself and the rest of us in the
[208:07.91]Actually, very, very true statement.
[208:10.29]I don't like what you're saying.
[208:11.17]I don't grow a car.
[208:14.64]Hulk's bad.
[208:16.30]Hulk's like worse than a super villain.
[208:20.74]Okay, how many people has the Joker killed?
[208:23.82]Like what?
[208:24.16]Like less than 20?
[208:26.29]Just today, the Hulk has killed like 5,000 fucking people.
[208:30.97]I'm talking only today.
[208:41.15]Alright, this is the frame rate boss.
[208:52.66]Grab him.
[208:59.36]I gotta get like up on his head.
[209:00.38]Grab him!
[209:21.87]The army's doing damage.
[209:25.74]Yeah, I know.
[209:29.86]Oh, fuck.
[209:40.64]I think I lose.
[209:44.21]I need to retry this one.
[209:45.87]I'm gonna be here for a long time.
[209:48.07]I'm gonna be here for a very, very long time.
[210:06.80]What did he say?
[210:07.92]What?
[210:08.70]What did he say?
[210:11.81]What did he just say?
[210:12.49]What do you mean?
[210:13.33]I wasn't even paying attention.
[210:15.57]He said, mop up.
[210:16.85]I'm done here, right?
[210:18.07]Like, I'm done.
[210:18.69]Wait, what?
[210:19.91]What are you talking about?
[210:24.03]Hold on.
[210:25.47]Let me hear that again.
[210:26.23]What are you...
[210:52.99]When the Hulk is confined by a special attack, he can struggle.
[211:04.46]Yes, okay.
[211:05.12]Alright, kill me.
[211:05.82]I want to hear what you guys are talking about.
[211:31.48]Come and mop up, boys.
[211:33.28]I'm done here.
[211:58.72]Come and mop up.
[212:01.65]Now, I'm not going to be able to unhear that for the next 30 times I die to this guy.
[212:07.51]Alright, stop it!
[212:31.56]Alright, launch a missile.
[212:34.90]Incoming missile.
[212:36.26]That's not a missile.
[212:37.10]I want you to do a missile.
[212:40.01]Doink!
[212:42.93]Tell me again to grab missiles and throw them back.
[212:44.73]I'd love to hear you tell me about it.
[212:46.03]Tell me.
[212:46.73]Yell at me.
[212:47.45]Jeremy, you should be grabbing missiles.
[212:48.79]Jeremy, grab the missile.
[212:49.47]You got one.
[213:18.40]Where's that tank?
[213:22.00]Where?
[213:24.36]Are you?
[213:24.68]Wait.
[213:25.10]I died.
[213:25.44]This is going to be hard.
[213:48.69]It's not that.
[213:49.53]It's come- It's coming mop up, boys.
[213:53.29]Coming mop up, boys.

[214:08.16]That's what he's saying!
[214:14.49]Hahahaha!
[214:26.23]Why would I do that?
[214:27.65]I was trying to like prove to you guys.
[214:29.65]What am I proving to you?
[214:30.85]You already know what it is.
[214:32.51]This guy's impossible.
[214:33.69]There's an elbow drop?
[214:45.12]There's run?
[214:56.35]What's going on?
[214:57.29]Oh, it fell.
[214:58.95]I don't even know what the strategy is.
[215:14.08]What am I talking about?
[215:17.28]There is no strategy.
[215:18.98]I have to take down four, five health bars with this.
[215:38.15]Grab his foot?
[215:58.41]tanks at them.
[215:59.21]Yeah, but I have to stand still for the tanks.

[216:03.68]Like, I'm already dead.
[216:36.94]I'm gonna try to throw tanks at him.
[216:47.24]Or is there a tank?
[216:55.30]Can I just get a shield for the time being until a tank shows up?
[217:07.95]I mean, what are you doing?
[217:09.93]Okay, here comes some tanks.
[217:18.59]Alright, let's go.

[217:31.62]Did we throw it?

[225:12.71]I never wanted it to be this way.
[225:14.79]But there had to be a failsafe.
[225:17.13]You've become a threat to innocent civilians, Bruce.

[227:43.27]Those restraints you're wearing translate your strength into nerve impulse energy.
[227:48.52]The more powerful the prisoner, the more energy he uses to restrain himself.
[227:54.28]If you become the Hulk, you'll kill yourself.
[227:59.28]You can't break a man who's already broken, Blonsky.

[228:09.15]I know how tough you are to the nearest decimal point.
[228:11.95]I don't need to know how to become like you.

[228:22.89]I know, you get angry and it makes you big and green.
[228:28.93]Well, make sure we have so many protocols in place to prevent you from doing that.

[230:11.14]Oh wow, once I got critical mass, just run through.
[230:13.44]Ooh!
[230:13.72]There's a lot of blood.
[230:27.42]Wanna see more blood?
[230:36.19]You think the Hulk should get more blood out of his enemies?
[230:41.50]Hey, by the way, how the fuck does that even work?
[230:55.03]When you text like the five digits, I don't understand.
[230:57.59]It's not a phone number.
[230:58.25]I don't get it.
[230:58.71]How does that make any sense?
[231:10.33]They don't do that anymore?
[231:12.15]Yeah, remember it was like, if you want the funny cat wallpaper, text funny wallpaper to like, whatever, number, number, number, number, number, right?

[232:28.85]Alright, we're good.
[232:31.53]We should play Stock Market Simulator.
[232:33.21]Is that a real game?
[232:36.32]Wait, is that a real game?
[232:39.32]Is that a real game?
[232:40.02]Does it follow the S&P?
[232:55.12]I'm not Shrek.
[232:56.88]Different big green guy.
[233:02.04]I mean, I guess I'm like a muscular version, I guess.
[233:13.87]I want missiles.
[233:21.48]Hey, what's the fucking timing then?
[233:31.33]Seriously, what's the timing on that shit?
[233:39.64]He just exploded himself.
[233:41.82]Haha, Shrek wins again.
[233:54.58]Uh oh.
[233:56.64]That's bad.
[233:57.40]Is there a reason why we're counting?
[234:02.69]What is this for?
[234:04.09]What is this for?
[234:28.46]Watch it.
[234:28.90]No, the grab moves are so dumb.
[234:31.60]Like, what the fuck?

[267:42.50]I'm going to get a water and I'm going to take a small pee.
[267:53.92]Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[267:56.36]I'm Jerva.
[268:14.89]New moves are available, and new Blonsky files to be unread.

[269:58.42]I'm going to get some water and take a small pee.
[270:00.73]I'll be right back.
[274:05.04]When does it start?
[274:10.98]Four and a half hours ago.
[274:20.97]Bad joke.
[274:22.75]I got a water too.
[274:27.34]What's next?
[274:37.50]This is called meme.png.
[274:39.16]Oh.

[274:51.37]Okay.
[274:58.16]Strange cargo.
[274:59.50]Okay.
[275:07.32]I want that better dash.

[275:13.93]Something like that.
[275:16.33]150,000.
[275:18.73]How far away is this?
[275:20.53]Oh, that's so whatever.
[275:21.73]Could have just done this jump pod.
[275:41.06]Oh, not Murius.
[275:46.72]We have very little time.
[275:48.72]If Ross and his men realize I've stolen the regulator axis, they'll move to relocate the other half.
[275:53.66]We can't control power to the machine without it.
[275:56.12]That's why I'm sending you back out there.
[275:58.24]I know it's a risk because of this emergent devil hulk, but we have no choice.
[276:02.00]What is this?
[276:02.66]They're going to be on you like ants on a free meal.
[276:05.56]Make sure the regulator stays safe because this is our last chance.
[276:09.37]Oh no.
[276:10.17]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[276:11.69]I have to go and retrieve and bring shit back to the church.
[276:16.17]Is there any other missions in the game?
[276:22.51]Besides get item and put item into item box back at church.
[276:32.55]Apparently they're right here.
[276:33.55]Holy shit.
[276:39.42]Sorry.
[276:46.86]I get hurt by that.
[276:52.87]There's a fucking lot of you here.
[277:16.92]I wonder if this scenario would... Yep.
[277:19.80]No, I didn't want to pick you up.
[277:28.32]Who am I targeting with this?
[277:31.58]Uh...
[277:42.17]So this is where we run.
[277:44.75]And we pick up and run, pick up, run.
[277:47.31]Pick up, run, and that's it.
[277:48.61]We don't do anything else.
[277:55.30]How would practicing my moves help when there's ten people doing moves around me?
[278:00.42]Like, it... I... I'm just gonna grab it and run.
[278:04.78]Did you see how close the helicopter was?
[278:17.91]I'm just gonna do this.
[278:18.57]Why do I even fight any of these things?
[278:35.40]Wait, did I not get it?
[278:36.22]Wait, hold on.
[278:37.59]There was... Was it inside?
[278:38.67]It was inside that truck.
[278:46.20]Let's wait for the heal Go!
[279:20.73]Bring truck to the military base.
[279:22.66]Oh.
[279:23.42]Not the church.
[279:33.13]Wait.
[279:34.23]I can't jump with the truck.
[279:36.57]So I have to just walk.
[279:56.25]How much is left in this game?
[279:58.02]It can't be much more.
[279:59.46]Right?
[280:00.08]I took back the fucking secret serum, right?
[280:01.90]That means that's it.
[280:02.88]We're at the end of the game.
[280:17.67]Two missions.
[280:18.37]Oh, alright.
[280:18.97]Well, let's go.
[280:40.19]Alright, brought the truck.
[280:41.57]Weaponize.
[280:45.99]What?
[280:53.22]What the hell are you doing?
[280:59.38]Can I jump?
[281:06.06]No, there is no jumping.
[281:07.00]I mean, does this count as plus one letter grade?
[281:09.57]I mean, sure, I guess I think it does.
[281:11.35]I'm Fred Flintstoning this car, but I am driving the car.
[281:33.23]it's just a car coming through you know this is how cars drive somebody's got run over wait I can stop because he'll see through my what did he hurt what happened what is this this is a tree
[282:09.75]Wait, do I have to get it checked?
[282:10.85]How does this work?
[282:16.84]Hold on there.
[282:17.34]Are they going to pat the car down?
[282:19.64]Did it.
[282:55.13]I can't go faster than this.
[282:57.82]Why wouldn't I punch through the front and drive the car?
[283:02.08]You know, pull my feet up, tuck my feet up, punch through the front of the bed here, and grab the wheel and just drive.
[283:11.10]What does this achieve?
[283:13.44]I can still wear the car, but be driving it.
[283:15.26]Why don't Hulk just drive the car?
[283:20.47]Why do I have to walk with it?
[283:29.14]Oh.
[283:31.04]Retrieve the cube now.
[283:48.61]This is the wrong thing.
[283:57.68]Get...
[284:02.55]Give me the cube!
[284:08.16]That was football.
[284:25.52]That was American football.
[284:28.97]This is American football, but the... The ball is greased up with oil.
[284:35.81]Oh, this sucks.
[284:36.63]I have to do that whole thing again.
[284:44.72]Holy shit, this is horrible.
[284:47.82]I have to walk the car again.
[285:12.30]There has to be a faster way to do- No, there is no- There is not a faster way to do this.
[285:16.69]Like, Jet Patriots must be- Yeah, this is nice.
[285:42.69]I'm going to die.
[285:53.58]Did I die?
[285:54.44]Did it hit me?
[285:54.90]I think I'm good.
[286:06.95]No, that was the right warp because I'm going to despawn all those enemies.
[286:17.89]Come back.
[286:18.25]Ain't going to be any enemies there at all.
[286:20.73]Truck will be right there and I can walk the truck back in.
[286:30.74]Oh, these are all funny images of you.
[286:32.10]Good.
[286:33.10]What the hell was that?
[286:39.50]Oh.
[286:46.12]Wrong warp.
[286:48.32]It's down there.
[286:49.60]Wait, what?
[286:53.02]Wait a minute.
[286:56.22]Okay, for a second I thought that... We're good.
[287:08.81]Just run this back.
[287:10.01]Get full health.
[287:15.58]Why do I have fuck all health for being so close to the end of the game?
[287:18.14]There's only one more health upgrade.
[287:20.52]I have the first two.
[287:21.32]There's only three.
[287:24.76]I think what you're describing is... A decision that the developers made when they made this game.
[287:31.04]Why can't Hulk have like 10,000 more HP?
[287:32.50]You're gonna make me ban Link?
[287:43.72]I'll just turn him off.
[287:44.84]Hey, you know what?
[287:45.48]Teach him a lesson.
[287:46.08]Turn Lynx off.
[287:48.96]Just disable Lynx.
[287:50.84]I'll teach him a lesson.
[288:00.01]Alright.
[288:02.33]Time to teach him a lesson.
[288:10.80]Alright, fine.
[288:12.48]Mods, if people do a link in chat, sign them up for 10 minutes.
[288:18.65]Got it.
[288:19.23]That's going to happen.
[288:20.71]That's going to happen to you.
[288:21.57]I've just made the order.
[288:23.13]I just gave the order.
[288:24.01]It's going to happen.
[288:25.95]The order has been placed.
[288:30.17]It's going to happen.
[288:32.04]If you do purple text with a link, you're out of here.
[288:36.08]10 minutes.
[288:42.02]That's it.
[288:49.33]Purge them.
[289:05.33]Oh, you guys are getting fucking destroyed.
[289:08.74]Tell you, I'm a man of my word 40% of the time.
[289:11.24]This is one of those times.
[289:12.22]Oh, I see what you did there.
[289:22.53]You tried to get Nightbot banned.
[289:24.17]You tried to get Nightbot timed out.
[289:25.49]Nightbot has immunity.
[289:40.35]Why would I time out Nightbot?
[289:41.51]He controls everything here.
[289:47.36]And slowly, slowly the links begin to cease.
[289:55.18]The 10 minute timeout has got them all fucked up.
[289:59.23]Okay.
[290:04.77]Let's go!
[290:11.70]Hurry, go!
[290:13.46]Where am I going?
[290:25.41]This is not even the right fucking way to go!
[290:27.07]There's only one exit!
[290:45.90]Oh shit, can I just go to the front?
[290:49.24]Fuck!
[290:50.56]Fuck, fuck, fuck!
[291:05.67]Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[291:15.03]But you didn't just do that!
[291:30.06]Give me them!
[291:30.64]Give me them!
[291:31.12]Give me them!
[291:31.48]Give me them!
[291:36.49]They have so many things!
[291:39.99]So many things!
[291:45.06]Get in there!
[291:45.86]Come on, Bruce!
[291:47.10]Come on, deliver it into the end zone!
[291:49.06]Go!
[291:51.27]Touchdown.
[292:04.83]I did it.
[292:07.13]Now I have to get another one.
[292:09.95]Okay, here's a very important thing to ask.
[292:12.81]Do I have to pretend to be a car again?
[292:27.73]I hope I don't have to.
[292:28.65]That would just be ridiculous, right?
[292:34.10]That would be absurd.
[292:35.00]If I had to go pretend to be a car again.
[292:38.28]That's just... That's outrageous.
[293:01.14]Okay, here we go.
[293:03.85]It's up here.
[293:04.63]Is that it?
[293:09.55]There's a trap.
[293:11.25]Yeah, there's a trap.
[293:15.33]I mean, that's a pretty nice supercomputer.
[293:16.67]I bet that thing has a fucking 2080.
[293:17.62]Watch this.
[293:17.98]It is a trap.
[293:29.26]Boo, boo.
[293:30.02]Ah, whatever.
[293:45.45]Um... No, I want to throw it at the thing.
[293:54.85]All I care about is throwing this shit.
[293:57.65]The things.
[294:04.29]You freak, you freak, you freak!
[294:11.40]5G noise.
[294:14.10]Alright, somebody has to die.
[294:16.88]I need help.
[294:20.70]Did you die outside of the playing area?
[294:38.67]Come on, they all have the grabby move.
[295:16.38]Use your combo.
[295:18.98]Oh, you know the words to say to get me going.
[295:26.98]It was the fucking 5G noises.
[295:29.10]It would mess with my brain.
[295:37.80]Alright, so here's the plan.
[295:38.46]Just kill.
[295:39.22]Just kill.
[295:42.05]Trying to get out of there quickly.
[295:43.77]I'm just gonna go combo, combo, combo, combo, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, punch, punch, punch.
[295:50.63]Because I need health.
[295:51.93]And I cannot fight 10 of those guys at once.
[295:56.31]No, no, no, no.
[295:56.97]This is not gonna happen.
[295:58.14]No.
[296:00.26]He took the bait.
[296:01.42]Wait a minute.
[296:01.80]What if I just don't go in there?
[296:04.72]Will they spawn outside?
[296:05.58]Wait a minute.
[296:13.17]What if they spring the trap when I'm not even in it?
[296:31.39]Uh... Oh.
[296:32.15]Ugh, my ears.
[296:56.14]Give him a grab.
[297:02.54]Give him a grab.
[297:04.04]Give him a grab.
[297:04.90]Grab him, son.
[297:22.07]Like, I'm locked on over here.
[297:23.91]Why would you even be turned the other direction?
[297:28.15]What's the point of a lock on?
[297:29.80]We don't even fucking lock on!
[297:55.25]So many people got timed out.
[298:01.05]Justice has been served.
[298:03.22]Sorry, what you should have said was, justice has been served.
[298:15.53]I have another idea.
[298:17.25]And it's dumb enough to work.
[298:20.62]It's going to work.
[298:21.68]I'm going to throw like seven or eight items into the arena.
[298:26.52]It's a hardcore match now.
[298:27.56]Because I'm just going to throw it at the 5G towers and that's it.
[298:42.44]And then I'm just going to run.
[298:57.31]I'm going to get steel fists.
[299:00.03]This is a tables, ladders, and chairs match.
[299:01.97]No, this is a truck, street lights, and mailbox event.
[299:35.85]Alright, let's go.
[299:38.03]They're all in there.
[299:38.63]Good.
[299:38.83]This is perfect.
[299:39.43]Perfect.
[299:41.19]Just get this shit done.
[299:42.05]Four of them.
[299:42.93]You didn't think I was going to do this shit, did you?
[299:50.07]Stop.
[300:13.63]What are you doing it again?
[300:18.73]Wait, you're doing it again?
[300:21.41]Wait a second.
[300:22.85]I'm not in a cutscene.
[300:24.99]What the fuck?
[300:28.99]I'm in a cutscene, man.
[300:30.79]That's not fair.
[300:37.04]There's two on top of each other here.
[301:23.99]Why did you stop hitting the towers?
[301:26.37]Let me think.
[301:27.46]Because the game's respawned them.
[301:30.26]And while in the cutscene... Sorry, cow.
[301:34.20]I got grabbed and got killed.
[301:37.76]Were we watching the same video?
[301:54.34]Okay.
[301:55.06]Fucking come on.
[301:56.44]Get out of here.
[301:58.68]Yes, I know.
[301:59.40]There it is.
[301:59.82]Yeah, we got him.
[302:02.21]Tango 2.
[302:03.13]Whatever he says.
[302:04.31]Cerberus.
[302:05.35]Tango minus 2.
[302:25.64]Oh my fucking God.
[302:46.97]Oh my fucking God.
[302:54.79]probability to get grabbed here is like 85 you can't fight
[303:23.93]Have you tried the Hulk smash yet?
[303:26.29]Shit, I forgot about that one.
[303:28.51]What was it called again?
[303:29.49]What was it called?
[303:30.93]Hulk what?
[303:33.77]Hulk gently pet kitty cat?
[303:43.38]Let me just get 5,000 bits.
[303:44.50]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[303:52.63]That's $50 from Vilemi.
[303:54.21]What if I gave you a bunch of money to post links?
[303:56.19]No.
[303:56.99]You can't.
[303:57.75]And then they do asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.
[304:00.71]That means that their link got timed out.
[304:02.17]$50 and I'm going to buy you a link.
[304:04.00]You're up.
[304:05.84]Thanks for the $50 though.
[304:06.60]That's a lot of fucking money.
[304:07.58]That's too much money.
[304:08.92]That's an insane amount of money.
[304:11.40]Thank you for giving it to me.
[304:16.67]Um.
[304:18.10]I can't bring weapons in, otherwise the game breaks and decides to respawn everything.
[304:21.62]I can't fight him because I get grabbed.
[304:23.82]What am I supposed to do?
[304:25.48]Run and grab and throw?
[304:27.28]Here's my strategy.
[304:28.42]Ready?
[304:29.70]Run, grab, throw.
[304:30.92]Run, grab, throw.
[304:31.90]Run, grab, throw.
[304:32.79]Run, grab, throw.
[304:33.69]Run, grab, throw.
[304:34.67]Run, grab, throw.
[304:35.69]Run, grab, throw.
[304:36.63]Run, grab, throw.
[304:37.51]That's the plan.
[304:40.91]There's health in here.
[304:41.63]I don't even need to get it.
[304:42.39]What's the point?
[304:44.83]Here we go.
[305:35.07]Oh, shit.
[305:35.41]The cops are here, guys.
[305:36.39]That means they're gonna stop, right?
[305:48.76]Let me do it!
[305:49.56]They're all holding me!
[306:00.38]What?
[306:00.94]Is there a helicopter?
[306:03.67]Who do I have?
[306:05.56]That guy can't get back in.
[306:06.72]That's not fair.
[306:40.83]What?
[306:43.97]Let me the fuck out of here.
[306:46.21]Let me out of here.
[306:46.83]Let me out.
[306:47.21]Let me out.
[306:47.51]Let me out of here.
[306:48.01]Get me out of here.
[306:48.53]I did it.
[306:51.26]What?
[307:12.89]Let's go!
[307:15.66]Let me the fuck out of here!
[307:17.24]Where is there another tower?
[307:18.56]There's no tower!
[307:20.86]There's nothing holding this shit up!
[307:22.44]It's bullshit!
[307:24.02]There's nothing here!
[307:36.75]Right there?
[307:37.15]What do you mean right there?
[307:37.93]Where?
[307:38.21]What do you see?
[307:43.66]Behind me, I don't see anything.
[307:45.38]It's hard to see anything.
[307:49.56]Right there.
[307:50.30]Right there.
[307:51.64]Right there.
[307:52.62]Right there.
[307:53.60]Right there.
[307:54.12]Right there.
[307:56.35]Right there.
[307:57.05]In the corner?
[308:07.09]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[308:20.35]corner of the circle circles don't have corners motherfucker
[308:49.50]Do I have to kill them?
[308:50.30]Oh, he's got one of our boys!
[309:19.21]Okay.
[309:20.55]All the 5G towers are dead.
[309:22.13]I just have to kill this one dickhead.
[309:27.42]He's dead.
[309:28.50]Okay, let's go.
[309:36.32]No, that's a 5G air conditioner.
[309:37.98]That's not a 5G tower.
[309:39.32]What?
[309:46.70]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[310:15.85]On the street?
[310:18.36]No, that's just a telephone pole.
[310:28.35]What the fuck?
[310:29.79]What are you talking about?
[310:43.70]Actually soft-locked well look what's going on over there like this an explosion an explosion over there Look up
[311:13.19]Let me look up.
[311:15.19]Okay, I have a minute here to look.
[311:39.37]Keep one alive.
[311:41.31]Keep one...
[311:47.05]Is that it?
[311:51.36]It's the air conditioners.
[312:07.71]It's the 5G air conditioners.
[312:30.16]Just kill me.
[313:06.17]the one that's on fire, but I can't target it.
[313:10.56]I can't target it.
[313:11.20]Oh no, not one of our boys.
[313:39.65]Go back to the sewer where you belong.
[313:47.50]You have the 1.1B version.
[313:51.16]You have to go... Guys, this is the Xbox game.
[313:56.72]This is the original Xbox game.
[314:00.07]What do you mean I have to go get like a patch for this?
[314:10.73]There was no Xbox version MonkaS.
[314:18.31]That would be weird.
[314:23.23]Restart your system.
[314:25.01]Let me try this one more time.
[314:29.35]I need to patch?
[314:31.43]Wait, do I actually need to go download like an Xbox?
[314:34.59]Can I even do that on 360?
[314:37.42]On a backwards compatible game, can you connect- does that exist?
[314:41.84]That's not real, right?
[314:45.25]Okay, there it is.
[314:53.39]Go get trapped.
[314:57.72]Okay, here it comes.
[314:58.96]Do it.
[314:59.74]Put up the towers.
[315:00.64]One, two, three, four towers.
[315:03.00]That's it.
[315:04.12]Alright.
[315:11.68]Disable the Gamma Shield.
[315:48.89]I can't even target the fucking thing.
[315:55.92]This is just getting bullies.
[315:58.88]Yes, it is.
[316:00.72]I can't even target it.
[316:03.00]I gotta kill somebody.
[316:08.95]Oh, now you target it.
[316:09.89]Great.
[316:40.10]Oh my goodness.
[316:43.38]I had it beat the last time, too.
[316:45.13]That's what's so annoying.
[316:46.45]Is this a port?
[316:52.68]No.
[316:53.12]This came out on Xbox and GameCube and PlayStation 3, right?
[316:57.64]PlayStation 2?
[317:05.00]Just cheat.
[317:05.58]We allow you to.
[317:06.40]Alright.
[317:07.14]Here's the deal.
[317:08.64]If this screws up again, I'm going to cheat.
[317:11.82]I'm going to do an infinite hell.
[317:12.78]Is that even possible?
[317:25.47]I didn't even want to do that.
[317:26.59]And now I've probably bugged it again.
[317:27.79]I grabbed a car on the way in here.
[317:44.21]Let's see if it works.
[318:13.26]He's got one of our boys.
[318:25.25]This is not a drill.
[318:26.51]He's got one of our boys.
[318:29.49]Just give me that health pack.
[318:49.26]Get me out of here.
[318:49.94]I did it.
[318:50.22]I did it.
[318:50.58]Go, go, go.
[318:51.18]Get this box.
[318:53.76]Quick.
[318:54.24]Bring... Did I get out of the field?
[318:59.06]I think I'm out of the force field.
[319:00.53]Did I get out of the force field in time?
[319:01.87]I'm out.
[319:03.69]I'm out.
[319:03.97]I'm out.
[319:04.19]I'm out.
[319:04.47]I'm out.
[319:04.67]I'm out.
[319:05.13]I'm out.
[319:05.35]They pushed me out.
[319:06.87]These fucking idiots pushed... No.
[319:18.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[319:22.40]It's.
[319:24.25]No.
[319:25.67]No.
[319:26.11]No.
[319:33.57]He's got one of our boys.
[319:41.73]Oh my God.
[319:42.51]I don't even have any emotions right now.
[319:49.68]What emotional thing can I even say?
[320:11.61]It's gonna fuck up again, isn't it?
[320:12.70]There's no way this works.
[320:36.23]Hmm.
[321:10.84]Okay.
[321:14.86]Get it.
[321:15.52]Yeah.
[321:17.19]Oh, get it.
[321:18.23]Okay.
[321:18.87]But look out.
[321:20.09]A trap.

[324:10.36]I mean, I don't think there was any doubt.
[324:13.49]That wasn't... I don't think people were truly doubting me.
[324:16.29]And if they were... Then just shove it in their face what I just did.
[324:24.27]A cube.

[325:27.02]God damn it.
[325:27.84]Okay, defend the church for ten minutes.
[325:29.42]Last time it was a huge overestimation.
[325:31.60]It's going to be like four.
[325:32.76]It was a major overestimate last time.
[325:53.50]This guy's really bad with time.
[325:54.43]He just wants to make sure he's not... You'd rather have a lot of time than a little, right?
[326:01.15]Oh, no.
[326:01.67]Toddler planes.
[326:02.43]How much time?
[326:15.14]How much time?
[326:30.15]What?
[326:34.95]Come on, I gotta kill the toddler planes.
[326:38.19]They're the hardest things.
[326:39.15]What does that mean?
[326:53.56]How do you dodge that?
[327:09.43]God damn it.
[327:10.21]I have to jump on it.
[327:20.87]It can just avoid it so easily.
[327:22.25]Where's the other one?
[327:28.58]Give me a break.
[327:29.94]Okay.
[327:31.24]Just, I'm gonna throw everything here at him.
[327:33.00]Just whip, just whip shit at him over and over again.
[327:38.71]There's nothing to throw.
[328:21.83]Which one's gonna come in first?
[328:22.81]Probably this one.
[328:25.65]Yup.
[328:26.11]Wait till they turn around.
[328:28.75]By the way, he just turned with... Stopped moving to turn.

[333:16.27]This devil creature, can you be certain he's real?
[333:25.87]Trust me.
[333:27.15]He's as real as the Hulk is.
[333:28.83]Understood.
[333:30.29]I'm going to activate the machine.
[333:32.55]I'm sorry, Bruce.
[333:33.49]This next part will be very unpleasant.
[333:36.78]Good luck.
[333:45.75]He's like, vaporized me.
[333:46.99]Diablo versus uber Diablo.
[334:09.62]Hulk is not afraid.
[334:11.68]Also, pay no attention to my giant glowing, hit the boss in the eye, weakness.
[334:18.87]Don't look at that.
[334:20.27]Stay away from that.
[334:21.63]Won't you join me, Bruce?
[334:42.33]Wait, I got him in his mouth?
[334:56.28]What?
[335:01.94]Wait, what was that?
[335:10.98]X58320?
[335:11.38]Don't turn the console off.
[335:16.90]Wait, why is there an error?
[335:18.34]Dude, you can accidentally just press A and it'd turn the console off.
[335:28.87]You did so bad the Xbox died.
[335:30.91]Alright, yeah, do not press that button.
[335:52.21]Alright, get out.
[335:57.68]No, I won't join you.
[335:59.22]I will never join you.
[336:02.02]Join me, and together we can destroy the Sith.
[336:15.85]Oh, -2, that fucking classic scene that was.
[336:34.43]oh no no it's one down I don't know what that really means third egg almost destroyed
[337:00.62]Third egg.
[337:01.78]Defeated.
[337:02.24]Now what?
[337:04.09]Did I beat him?
[337:11.23]Did I hurt him now or something?
[337:19.76]I just got it off.
[337:20.74]Holy shit.
[337:21.38]I just did the super critical pain.
[337:22.86]I did it with his groin.
[337:29.26]What the hell?
[337:35.83]Alright, now what?
[337:36.49]This is like phase two.
[337:39.07]Do these have health in them?
[337:41.51]Alright, I just kicked him in the tail.
[338:02.66]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[338:12.35]Get out.
[338:13.47]Don't go in the fire.
[338:15.85]Oh, the eggs are coming back.
[338:16.75]Okay.
[338:20.17]All three eggs need to be destroyed before you can affect Crocodile Man.
[338:23.49]Are you afraid, boy?
[338:48.78]I feel like how I used to feel when I would play a game that I knew my computer couldn't handle back in, like, 2002.
[338:55.76]But I wanted to try anyways.
[338:59.12]And you pretended to not care.
[339:02.12]And you really did everything possible to not get annoyed at the fact that your computer wasn't good enough because you had, like, a fucking GeForce, like, 300M in your computer.
[339:17.73]But, it's hard to not be angry.
[339:29.31]Take it out.
[339:32.19]Alright, is that all of them?
[339:33.01]One more.
[339:37.77]Shit, he just swiped.
[339:41.73]There it is, three.
[339:42.67]Alright, don't fucking be stupid here.
[339:44.43]What the hell?
[339:53.44]Where?
[339:57.38]Huh?
[340:01.86]Just heal up.
[340:26.10]Are you from Hebrews?
[340:33.37]Fuck.
[340:34.19]I don't know what the opportunity is to go in.
[340:52.63]Oh, Jesus.
[340:54.89]I can't.
[340:55.35]How am I?
[340:56.51]By going, I just get killed.
[340:57.59]There's no.
[340:59.43]He's got like this fucking gel.
[341:01.83]I did some damage.
[341:05.30]Let me get some heals.
[341:06.76]Oh, I didn't want to go that way.
[341:14.57]What are you?
[341:15.01]Out of your mind?
[341:32.50]Does this hurt him, by the way?
[341:33.52]It really should.
[341:53.50]Get out!
[342:01.94]Pray for me, Bruce.
[342:06.33]I went to Taco Bell at 3 a.m.
[342:09.23]And it was kind of cold when I ate it.
[342:11.67]Pray for me, Bruce.
[342:20.89]Hashtag shit my pants.
[342:22.85]Hashtag diarrhea.
[342:23.81]Hashtag Taco Bell doesn't give you diarrhea.
[342:26.06]People just say it because it's a funny meme.
[342:29.98]If you have memes...
[342:31.92]I do.
[342:32.80]I am you.
[342:33.30]In fact, Bruce, I can't tell you the last time I actually did have diarrhea.
[342:48.76]It had to have been at least two years ago.
[342:50.64]I don't know why I continue to say that.
[343:16.14]He's farming minus twos.
[343:18.07]He's farming minus twos again, isn't he?
[343:29.75]What's this?
[343:32.89]His health.
[343:34.84]Just stay alive.
[343:50.67]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[343:53.89]No, he's doing the stupid ice move.
[344:29.32]Regen, please.
[344:30.14]Here we go, good.
[344:35.95]Sing something.
[344:37.87]Why?
[344:40.21]Oh, but I'd like to.
[345:04.42]I've got to fucking move.
[345:14.11]You can't be serious.
[345:19.41]He's going to tear my head off.
[345:26.04]Jeez.
[345:45.37]I'm just trying to get the health.
[345:46.25]That's all I wanted.
[345:46.87]I got it.
[345:50.61]Where the fuck am I?
[346:22.15]Fuck.
[346:24.25]Please.
[346:31.33]No!
[346:34.65]I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[346:36.51]No, please.
[346:40.17]What the fuck?
[346:41.31]I can't even walk on.
[346:58.12]You fucking piece of shit.
[347:00.19]Give me a break.
[347:01.49]That was dog shit.
[347:03.43]Fuck you
[347:43.56]How much health?
[347:45.73]Oh, FX.
[347:46.15]Turn him off.
[347:54.90]This is my time.
[347:55.50]This is my time.
[347:56.18]This is my time to do it.
[347:57.40]This is my time to do it.
[348:01.54]We got it!
[348:18.19]What?
[348:19.31]Oh, he's... Are you afraid, boy?
[348:24.07]Don't get greedy, don't get greedy, don't get greedy.
[348:25.81]Just run away.
[348:26.79]Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time.
[348:29.43]Pain is good for you.
[348:38.43]Save that critical mass.
[348:40.33]Anger sips you loose.
[349:10.42]Get out, out, out, out, out.
[349:16.00]Get out, out, out, out.
[349:16.72]What are you, crazy?
[349:18.84]Greed is unreal.
[349:30.25]Unreal.
[349:30.65]The greed is unreal.
[349:31.39]Get out.
[349:40.51]That's it, he's dead.
[349:41.07]No, he's not.
[349:42.55]Oh my God.
[349:51.31]Get the hell out of here.
[350:03.82]Get the hell out of here.
[350:14.14]I win.
[350:14.40]You ain't got nothing.
[350:19.32]You're dead.
[350:20.52]He's gonna get up here and his health is gonna go to zero.
[350:21.89]Yeah!
[350:50.37]That was a terrible I just died thing to say.
[350:53.85]No, this is the wrong way.
[351:00.11]No, there's no phase two.
[351:15.74]It's not going to happen.
[351:27.40]It'd be funny if it was phase two.
[351:32.30]Save it.
[351:32.90]And I can get the final upgrade.
[351:34.18]Alright, give me one second.
[352:33.30]Oh, what happened?
[352:33.82]Why is it dark?
[352:36.10]This is what death is like?
[352:39.40]What happened?
[352:45.15]Wait, what?
[352:47.55]I changed to the wrong scene.
[352:49.23]This is apparently, there's a scene here.
[352:52.49]Oops, sorry about that.
[352:57.82]I pressed the wrong button.
[353:05.48]Alright.
[353:06.88]Get the last health upgrade.
[353:08.22]I don't think that's the end of the game.
[353:11.62]That's probably very close.
[353:12.62]Power surge level 3.
[353:14.76]Yes.
[353:14.98]Okay.
[353:20.05]Critical mass level 2.
[353:23.17]Yeah.
[353:25.81]Then... Missile pack weaponize.
[353:34.78]Yeah.
[353:37.69]Good.
[353:39.18]Any others?
[353:42.36]Air Sonic clap.
[353:43.32]Sure.
[353:45.10]IMB in the air.
[353:45.80]Cool.
[353:53.87]Alright.
[353:54.13]I wonder... That was definitely the big apex of the whole game.
[353:58.24]This has to be the end.
[354:18.15]Back to the Badlands.
[354:27.06]The final boss wasn't patched into the Xbox version.
[354:29.34]That would be weird.
[354:32.58]Where is it?
[354:34.14]Uh, down.
[354:40.35]World 1 complete.
[354:43.57]No, this is called Intercept.
[354:49.35]Do I actually have to intercept another convoy?
[354:53.09]Okay.
[354:54.03]Your superhero duties are boring.
[354:55.23]Okay.
[354:55.39]Reach the vault.
[354:55.88]Reach the vault entrance.
[354:56.50]Just get to the vault entrance.
[354:57.32]I'm just going to run.
[355:27.14]Thought I just killed him Oh different guy Oh
[355:58.02]Alright, let's get him.
[356:11.32]Let's go get him.
[356:13.58]Okay.
[356:14.82]Reach.
[356:16.92]Subjective, get to the vault entrance.
[356:18.36]And the vault entrance is down there.
[356:20.74]Not going to waste a second here.
[356:24.34]Let's go.
[356:26.53]I want to get some health.
[356:29.97]And let's move.
[356:32.76]Fuck fighting a single thing.
[356:36.88]What superhero uses the front door?
[357:08.62]Virus elbow!
[357:09.84]You ain't gonna get me.
[357:11.42]You ain't gonna get me.
[357:12.60]You ain't gonna get me.
[357:14.02]You ain't gonna get me.
[357:15.86]I know you really want to try, but it's not going to happen.
[357:21.12]Not going to happen.
[357:25.27]Not going to happen.
[357:46.88]Probably shouldn't have skipped everything.
[357:48.08]I'm going to do the headbutt to this guy.
[357:51.88]It's the best move in the game.
[357:57.78]Although I can't.
[358:05.60]Do the cannonball?
[358:06.22]I don't have the cannonball.
[358:07.00]I bought the health and surge upgrades.
[358:09.20]Whatever they're called.
[358:11.64]It's alright.
[358:13.04]I'll just throw cars.
[358:16.53]Steel fist?
[358:17.07]No.
[358:17.35]Throw car is more effective.
[358:20.77]How did that miss?
[358:26.58]Okay.
[358:31.20]Again.
[358:31.44]Again.
[358:33.79]Throw car.
[358:34.39]Again.
[358:46.82]Good.
[358:48.86]I'll make sure I get that thing.
[358:49.78]Don't worry.
[358:54.68]It's a secret.
[358:55.42]We'll look at those comics.
[358:57.48]Got him.
[359:05.33]A few more of these.
[359:08.57]Okay.
[359:20.03]What?
[359:20.23]Alright.
[359:33.26]I need to move this way.
[359:35.26]Can I turn these into fists?
[359:42.23]No, I can't.
[359:43.69]Stop.
[359:44.57]Why is it no longer damaging him?
[359:49.70]It doesn't hurt him?
[359:51.44]Um... Why am I getting diminishing returns?
[360:02.02]You can't even avoid that attack.
[360:11.81]It's unavoidable.
[360:15.19]Use the combo.
[360:17.11]Okay.
[360:27.48]Um, can I not fucking hurt this guy?
[360:31.59]What is with this game?
[360:43.97]You can't fucking avoid that attack!
[361:00.33]Use elbow drop.
[361:01.79]How?
[361:05.75]I can't grab onto anything.
[361:06.86]I can't grab anything.
[361:07.60]I can't... I'm just going to do this.
[361:11.14]Fine.
[361:11.40]Okay.
[361:13.14]That actually just fucking worked.
[361:15.82]Okay.
[361:20.73]That's... No other moves work on him though.
[361:25.09]Only elbow drop.
[361:28.39]Oh my god.
[361:32.46]Of course that's the one that works.
[361:34.38]Alright, we're good.
[361:44.42]I hope this is just a QTE end of the game.
[361:48.96]The one time that I actually won it.
[361:51.38]That last boss fight was hell.
[361:54.86]Oh god.
[361:56.57]Just hold on, baby.
[361:58.47]I'm here.
[362:01.14]Blonsky.
[362:02.12]I should have come back sooner.
[362:05.02]Oh, God.
[362:07.22]I've lost her.
[362:09.48]I don't understand.
[362:11.34]Is this mission directive?
[362:12.64]I only wanted to help her, Pat.
[362:14.79]That's all I wanted.
[362:18.83]She's gone.
[362:20.89]What's happening here?
[362:22.17]Emil, who is she?
[362:23.71]My wife.
[362:29.67]They... they weren't infected.
[362:34.38]Our job was to examine what we knew of gamma radiation and its effect on human tissue.
[362:40.04]It was a government program sparked by your previous research.
[362:43.99]She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
[362:48.64]Emile, it's time to bring this to an end.
[362:52.46]No!
[362:53.32]You created Gamma Transmutation Banner.
[362:56.17]You did this to her.

[368:24.67]Me and Toadguy have not done a single thing.
[368:28.39]We haven't done anything.
[368:31.03]Maybe you shouldn't let Tartullus fly planes.
[368:34.45]Alright, I gotta get up.
[368:46.18]What?
[368:46.40]Holy shit, throw the rock!
[368:50.30]Oh ho ho ho ho! Oh!
[368:58.00]Oh good a plane crashed down here, good. -
[368:59.00]I got more health.
[369:20.54]Wait, I gotta stay with him.
[369:26.78]Okay, man!
[369:28.18]Man, just do it.
[369:29.73]Can we stop?
[369:38.29]I gotta get in front of him so he can take that fucking pain.
[369:44.23]It's both of us, man.
[369:45.23]We gotta both do this.
[369:48.82]Oh shit!
[369:50.56]Ow.
[369:51.94]I jumped way too high.
[369:56.23]I gotta fight him?
[369:58.10]Oh no no no, I do not.
[370:14.45]This is fucking stupid.
[370:16.89]This is the stupidest fucking thing I think I've ever seen.
[370:21.74]We're not even fighting each other.
[370:26.44]Stop shooting the missiles at me.
[370:33.82]Well, he's just as irritated as I am.
[370:36.93]Alright, should I go for a ball?
[370:38.21]Should I try to ball him?
[370:39.45]I'm gonna try to bowling ball him.
[370:41.89]Alright, here we go.
[370:42.31]I'm going to bowl him.
[370:42.85]I'm going to get the last hit on him.
[370:48.44]Okay, here we go.
[370:49.08]Bowling.
[370:51.22]No, that's not... What the fuck?
[371:12.85]This is too much for my brain.
[371:15.69]This is way too much.
[371:17.65]I feel like I'm cheating somehow.
[371:20.16]Don't you feel like I did this?
[371:22.02]That I turned this shit on?
[371:28.88]Here we go again, another fight.
[371:31.84]Okay, here we go, fight!
[371:34.86]I brought all my friends.
[371:43.91]Oh, Jesus.
[371:44.77]I don't want to destroy any of them.
[371:51.44]I want them to be here.
[371:52.44]I don't want them to die.
[371:53.64]It's making this way easier.
[372:03.13]Is he regaining health?
[372:04.83]I don't think so.
[372:05.69]I think this is just supposed to happen, except I don't think it's supposed to be like 10 planes fighting us.
[372:11.57]I think because I aggroed everything.
[372:20.74]I don't think this is supposed to be how this plays out.
[372:24.48]But it is.
[372:24.96]No, don't hit the plane!
[372:29.40]Fuck!
[372:31.29]Okay, let's keep going.
[372:34.93]He's headed for the dam.
[372:39.64]He's going for the dam.
[372:40.74]Stop him.
[372:44.56]Don't let him in the dam.
[372:48.04]Oh, no.
[372:51.13]No.
[372:55.83]Why?
[373:05.28]No, it's going to come back, right?
[373:07.08]It's not going to do this.
[373:09.93]Please.
[373:13.07]I'm taking the disk out.
[373:17.38]Alright, put it back in quick.
[374:07.04]Ah, you can't believe it.
[374:08.68]I can't believe the cutscene for him to break into the dam.
[374:16.97]Wait a minute.
[374:18.01]What is this bullshit?
[374:30.86]What is this bullshit?
[374:35.46]What is this?
[374:36.26]What is this bullshit?
[374:37.12]What is this?
[374:38.58]This is the mission before that.
[374:44.56]How did I not?
[374:44.94]It's over.
[374:45.48]Ugh.
[375:09.61]This one sucked, didn't it?
[375:12.05]This one sucked, right?
[375:16.49]No, this one's not that bad.
[375:20.73]It's not that bad.
[375:21.77]Okay.
[375:23.97]I can't believe he crashed at the dam.
[375:25.77]I can't believe he crashed at the dam of all the places.
[375:27.92]He crashed at the dam.
[375:29.94]I can't believe it.
[375:30.66]It's unbelievable.
[375:43.10]Is it gonna crash again?
[375:43.96]No, it's not.
[375:46.13]Don't say that.
[376:03.18]That was seriously... I'm so glad we played this game all the way to the end here.
[376:07.64]Because that last mission was just one of the most ridiculous things I think I've seen in a video game.
[376:15.81]I can't even believe it's possible.
[376:18.09]That shouldn't even be possible.
[376:21.63]But I'm glad I got to see it.
[376:22.95]Alright, kill this guy.
[376:25.71]Alright, we're not that far back.
[376:43.35]Wait, what?
[376:55.20]How did you miss the elbow drop?
[376:56.86]How did you land on a wall?
[376:59.12]How do you land on the wall?
[377:02.90]I don't understand.
[377:03.84]Get down.
[377:17.25]Where's this guy?
[377:17.95]Get crushed.
[377:32.40]I'm so glad this actually works.
[377:33.80]How sad would it be if I had to actually fight this boss again and potentially lose.
[377:46.04]Huge one to end it.
[377:56.89]He's trying to do the same shit to me.
[378:04.26]There you go.
[378:04.86]Get the fuck out of here.
[378:06.38]I win.
[378:07.32]Alright.
[378:07.94]Save the game.
[378:09.08]Wait, maybe could I not even save the game?
[378:14.96]Is that part of the problem?
[378:17.46]Those coins are...
[378:27.54]Alright, I got full health.
[378:28.40]We just have to do this shit again.
[378:30.22]Because it's the same mission.
[378:38.84]Are you sure I couldn't save?
[378:44.28]No, it's because it was the same mission.
[378:48.68]Right.
[378:49.34]That's why.
[378:50.04]Oh, this is bad.
[378:51.44]Did a raid come in?
[378:58.09]Oh shit, we did.
[379:01.03]Thanks, Lazy Purple.
[379:04.35]Welcome, everybody.
[379:05.69]We're currently trying to do the mission for the second time.
[379:08.11]We got fucking destroyed.
[379:12.67]I can't save it.
[379:13.31]Yeah.
[379:13.91]This just can't happen again.
[379:15.97]Welcome, guys.
[379:16.49]Thanks a lot.
[379:17.59]Hope you guys had a good stream.
[379:19.79]We've had a good stream here.

[379:31.39]Just move.
[379:32.85]Move with him.

[379:43.99]And that's it.

[380:24.53]That's so much more to do.

[380:37.23]all the way in fact I'm getting ready alright with my friends get them planes

[389:35.67]End game.
[389:37.51]We're in the end game now?
[389:46.05]Hulk, this message contains a coded subliminal.
[389:49.74]I'm hoping you can use it to track your target on the map.
[389:53.76]Alright, this is endgame.
[389:54.98]Do not allow Abomination to destroy the dam.
[389:58.85]Don't let him destroy the dam.
[390:01.65]Sounds fucking hard.
[390:02.75]Defeat Abomination.
[390:18.66]No, they came with me.
[390:28.68]Firing missiles.
[390:33.26]Don't let him destroy the dam.
[390:40.46]Oh, I am.
[390:44.12]Trust me, I am.
[390:51.79]Fire him.
[390:52.55]Fire at him.
[390:53.21]Whip it at him.
[391:17.59]Alright, here we go.
[391:18.65]That's where I want him!
[391:28.83]Don't- Oh fuck, he got me.
[391:36.03]It's okay.
[391:39.23]Stay right here.
[391:39.80]Do not allow him to do this.
[391:50.24]How do I stop him?
[391:52.02]What is he doing?
[392:01.73]Did I stop him?
[392:04.33]Holy shit, I just electrocuted him for two full health bars.
[392:08.17]I need health.
[392:20.44]Get some health back.
[392:26.42]Do not combat run me, please.
[392:29.10]I'm trying to regen health.
[392:30.24]Alright, here we go.
[392:37.62]Shit.

[393:05.83]He's going for another, I gotta get up there.
[393:07.75]I gotta top rope him.
[393:11.47]Light it up.

[393:14.13]Here we go, go, go.
[393:21.63]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, do it.
[393:37.10]Eat shit.
[393:46.86]Got one more health bar.
[393:47.98]He was way easier than fucking Satan.
[393:50.52]Of course he would be easier than Satan.
[393:53.74]Go to one of the generators dude.
[393:55.28]Jon you wanna go break one of the generators?
[394:02.20]Don't fire me.
[394:03.52]You're firing on me.
[394:06.72]You're stupid.
[394:10.98]You're just dumb.
[394:11.86]You're firing at the wrong person.
[394:16.63]Wait, here we go.
[394:24.67]Oh, shit.
[394:29.16]Get on top of it.
[394:29.96]I gotta get up there.
[394:32.43]Don't get electrocuted, you fucking stupid game!
[394:43.90]It's such a sloppy fucking mess.
[394:47.47]Oh my god, what's with the nuke?
[394:54.79]Kill him with fucking cards, who cares?
[395:02.94]What did I just catch?
[395:12.31]Oh, it's a mess.
[395:14.14]It's a fucking mess, but I'm going to beat him.
[395:15.46]I beat him.
[395:15.82]I win.
[395:16.14]Game over.
[395:16.44]See you tomorrow.
[395:33.55]It's a phase 2 probably.
[395:34.55]Did you actually just take out the dam?
[396:07.33]Wait, did he just accidentally kill himself?
[396:21.94]A dam burst today, releasing almost 20 million metric tons of water.
[396:26.26]In a statement released this morning, General Thaddeus Ross blamed the Hulk for their devastation.
[396:33.03]We had the cure.
[396:35.03]It was right there in front of us.
[396:37.05]Dreams always are, Len.
[396:38.89]But you can never reach out and take them now, can you?
[396:41.70]We could start again and finish this time.
[396:44.50]Still helicopters everywhere.
[396:47.70]I can't stay here.
[396:50.14]They're too afraid of the Hulk to let you try.
[396:53.56]I guess this is me, Len.
[396:56.16]I'm not a person anymore.
[396:57.50]I'm the Hulk.
[396:59.08]And I can't force people to understand.
[397:04.20]Even in cutscenes, it doesn't matter.
[397:06.85]This doesn't make any sense, Bruce.
[397:11.25]You don't have anywhere to go.
[397:13.42]Who does?
[397:23.89]I don't know, people going to work in the morning?
[397:26.54]People going on vacation?
[397:27.72]People going to the funeral for one of the 500,000 people you've killed over the last five days, Bruce?
[397:37.52]Will you tell me?
[397:38.06]Congratulations, you've defeated Abomination and have completed the game.
[397:47.35]You've unlocked Hard.
[397:48.29]I will never play that one.
[397:55.10]Savage Banner is now available.
[397:59.64]Enter villain to play the game as Abomination.
[398:06.79]That's cool.
[398:10.17]Go check the comics?
[398:10.95]I will.
[398:16.84]You can play as Banner the Human.
[398:18.62]That's so stupid.
[398:24.06]Alright, what is Savage Banner?
[398:25.20]I don't have access to Savage Banner.
[398:29.76]Where is it?
[398:37.65]Wait, it was at the very top?
[398:38.71]Figured it'd be all the way at the bottom.
[398:43.22]Savage Banner.
[398:52.55]You just play as just half-naked guy?
[398:55.31]Oh, that's funny.
[398:59.48]Why couldn't I have had that from the beginning of the game?
[399:13.07]Alright, well.
[399:14.25]Let's, um... Let's go to... Let's go back.
[399:20.53]Extras.
[399:24.71]Okay, art gallery.
[399:26.75]Comic book gallery.
[399:27.57]Gallery 1.
[399:28.23]Let's see.
[399:29.31]Here he is.
[399:29.69]Incredible Hulk.
[399:32.38]The original comic book was just a direct rip-off of Frankenstein.
[399:41.70]Incredible Hulk, the monster unleashed.
[399:46.08]Banner.
[399:50.56]The Incredible Hulk.
[399:52.38]They're smashing out and nothing can stop them.
[399:55.08]Oh, it's the Juggernaut.
[399:56.62]Side by side with the Juggernaut.
[400:00.10]Okay.
[400:04.70]The Incredible Hulk and the Wolverine.
[400:07.46]He's a bad guy.
[400:08.28]Hulk was a bad guy for like the first 30 years.
[400:10.44]Okay.
[400:21.53]It's the first comic that Wolverine was in.
[400:22.85]Why doesn't it have a star on it?
[400:31.51]Who will judge the Hulk?
[400:36.56]Hmm.
[400:38.04]Fantastic form.
[400:39.04]Vista's slippery arms.
[400:40.64]It's like... I know he's like the smartest man in the world.
[400:45.90]But... His power is just goofy.
[400:51.79]He's like a clay fighter.
[400:52.77]Incredible Hulk versus the Rhino.
[401:07.73]Hulk Pups.
[401:10.63]Twice the rage.
[401:14.69]Cool.
[401:16.03]With me and the boys.
[401:17.03]Funko Pups.
[401:21.25]Incredible Hulk.
[401:22.27]What is this?
[401:22.77]Is this a movie?
[401:27.78]Incredible Hulk.
[401:37.76]I only have one here.
[401:38.58]So strong.
[401:43.55]So strong.
[401:45.53]I don't remember this.
[401:54.65]What is that?
[401:58.29]Hulk versus Wolverine.
[401:59.67]Why do they hate each other so much?
[402:09.68]Nice.
[402:11.84]Nice.
[402:14.06]Nice.
[402:15.62]Nice.
[402:20.90]Nice.
[402:25.17]Pretty cool.
[402:26.01]This looks like a Goro render.
[402:31.01]I feel like this is like a Mortal Kombat render.
[402:36.43]Cool.
[402:38.71]That's pretty cool.
[402:41.03]These are nice.
[402:41.57]These are really nice.
[402:42.27]That's nice.
[402:48.16]Hey, wait for my Cocoa Puffs.
[402:52.20]Isn't any one of those commercials?
[403:00.23]Alright, movie gallery.
[403:02.15]In-game movies.
[403:03.17]Oh, the making of this.
[403:12.06]This is the gym that I'm going to show you.
[403:13.48]This is the tool that designers use.
[403:16.04]I'm a designer.
[403:16.64]I want to say, okay, well, what's it like to play it?
[403:20.79]Pretty good game, Kevin.
[403:22.11]Too easy, too hard.
[403:24.23]What is most fun to the player?
[403:25.81]The gym allows the designer...
[403:27.91]To play with these numbers and encounters in a very easy way as an example like right now Hulk's max charge jump He goes to a height of 20 meters so in this tool We can take that number and say bump it up to 40 meters from now holy shit You know all these computers are
[403:49.14]That was a blurred PlayStation controller.
[403:52.93]I did do a lot of the effects.
[403:54.33]Basically kind of built up an effects database that we use to blow up our props basically or damage them or make them smoke or make them light on fire.
[404:01.69]Anything that blows up or has fire, flame, smoke, debris, dirt.
[404:06.08]That's me.
[404:07.08]Nice.
[404:09.40]Basically Hulk won every effect.
[404:15.02]Took up a chunk of it.

[405:39.95]Do villain.
[405:40.69]Alright.
[405:41.05]What are some of these codes to put in?
[405:52.62]What are we going to do tomorrow?
[405:53.84]That's a really good question, actually.
[406:03.22]What are we gonna do tomorrow?
[406:15.29]Toontown.
[406:15.97]I don't think I can get Toontown set up tomorrow.
[406:19.39]Alright, what was another one?
[406:27.62]It's easy.
[406:29.84]It's so easy.
[406:30.78]It's so easy.
[406:32.44]You can do it.
[406:32.84]It's so easy.
[406:36.23]Toontown Rewritten is already set up.
[406:39.07]Toontown.
[406:43.99]Okay.
[406:44.27]I'll look into it tomorrow.
[406:47.11]But no, we're gonna like... I'm gonna have to like... We're gonna like crash the fucking server.
[406:57.81]I'm going to open up Toontown Remastered and the servers are going to turn off.
[407:02.49]It's not going to work out.
[407:06.59]I'm going to do like an 80 minute stream delay.
[407:09.59]What was the suit one?
[407:23.32]Did I unlock this suit fit?
[407:41.07]Can't do it.
[407:45.33]Character.
[407:45.83]Abomination.
[407:48.49]Alright.
[407:50.39]Chase.
[407:50.93]What was it?
[407:51.27]Smash 5?
[407:51.75]It's been almost 7 hours.
[408:02.21]I'm going longer than I should be.
[408:08.41]Remember I told you guys that I wanted to have streams capped at like six hours?
[408:12.55]Five to six hours max.
[408:13.65]Supposed to be moving around.
[408:18.32]Uh-oh.
[408:22.44]Smash 5 doesn't fit.
[408:26.92]What is it?
[408:27.24]Smash what?
[408:27.88]Smash 1 5?
[408:34.90]Oh, it just gives me points.
[408:38.96]Um... Is there another one?
[408:43.02]Is there one that's even worth doing?
[408:52.45]Oh, Canada.
[408:53.03]Okay.
[408:55.41]Oh, Canada and then Cheese 5.
[408:56.51]But there's also Retro.
[408:57.98]Okay.
[409:07.91]Canadian flag shorts.
[409:09.88]Okay.
[409:11.10]Are they on?
[409:11.60]Transit.
[409:29.07]Start up the game, dude.
[409:31.25]I gotta put these in.
[409:40.62]Mass transit.
[409:41.44]Okay.
[409:43.14]Now what?
[409:46.02]Toontown.
[409:46.74]T-O-O-N-T-W-N.
[409:48.89]Oh, I'm sure that works.
[409:53.65]Retro.
[409:54.23]Retro what?
[409:56.07]Does that fit?
[410:12.35]Retro, retro, uh, retro what?
[410:21.15]Retro what?
[410:23.13]Retro 64?
[410:24.23]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[410:32.12]Just, just retro 64.
[410:32.82]What?
[410:32.96]I don't care.
[410:52.95]Let's play with Abomination for 12 seconds and then end the stream.
[411:04.27]It's me!
[411:15.90]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[411:16.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[411:17.36]Hold on.
[411:17.86]Wrong one.
[411:18.16]Aren't you glad we sat there for that long and did that?
[411:27.43]We'll see you tomorrow.
[411:28.31]I'm gonna pretend to play Toontown tomorrow, but it's not gonna happen.
[411:33.26]I can guarantee it.
[411:33.96]Whenever one server or two servers that are probably just being rented for like less than a hundred people to play on that, because people really love that game and want to keep it going, which is very admirable and it's great, we're gonna destroy the whole thing and it'll be shut off in ten seconds.
[411:52.33]So that's not gonna happen.
[411:59.43]I'm willing to give it a look.
[412:08.78]We'll see.
[412:11.88]Anyways, let's do the bits and the subs fairly quickly here because I do want to get up.
[412:16.91]I'm going against my new rule where I said more stream days, less stream duration.
[412:25.35]I'm already breaking it because we're at seven hours.
[412:27.51]It's probably going to be about seven and a half hour stream.
[412:30.11]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[412:31.27]Doctor's orders.
[412:33.48]Anyways, Killcon, thanks for the $3.
[412:35.04]Jerma, if you had the choice between banning the top 1,000 chatters or selling your Funko Pops, which would you choose and why?
[412:42.34]I would sell the Funko Pops because I don't give a shit about them at all.
[412:45.75]They're interesting little toys, and I think they're cool.
[412:48.07]I think they're interesting.
[412:48.75]I would just sell them.
[412:51.31]Like, immediately.
[412:52.97]Like, today.
[412:53.39]I would just sell them.
[412:54.13]I'd put them on the market right now.
[412:56.43]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[412:58.09]Hey, Jerma.
[412:58.77]Hey, Fitty.
[413:00.44]the jewish bro thanks for 540 are you not doing the movie stream because uh manos the hands of fate is public domain and it's so bad it's good it would probably be a certified Jerma recommends movie tall streamer um it's on this I think everybody's seen that movie it was on the list but ever I think everyone has already seen it I wanna I wanna watch public domain movies that I've never seen before like the gorilla I guarantee you none of you have seen the gorilla and I haven't seen the gorilla
[413:30.94]I don't want to put on a movie that we're just re-watching.
[413:35.04]Oh, I remember this one.
[413:36.12]Manos.
[413:36.96]Yeah.
[413:38.52]Almost all of us have seen it, but let's watch it.
[413:41.54]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[413:42.44]I want new, fresh public domain content that you and I have never seen before.
[413:48.59]And I guarantee you there's probably less than one person that's seen The Gorilla in this chat.
[414:00.42]Fresh content.
[414:02.87]That's the reason why.
[414:04.45]That's not even remotely accurate.
[414:05.13]Let me just stop you there.
[414:05.89]I didn't become an adult, really, until I was like 20-fucking-6, 27, 28.
[414:08.03]You got a lot of time, don't worry.
[414:34.75]23 is not as old as you think it is.
[414:39.29]It's still extraordinarily young.
[414:46.96]He thinks he's an adult.
[414:48.92]I am.
[414:49.26]Yeah, you got plenty of time.
[414:53.97]Plenty of time.
[414:54.73]Trust me.
[414:56.70]uh uh the movement good it just was talking about slow motion it kind of went in slow motion just because of how all the coronavirus stuff it's hard to do a lot of stuff hard to set up a lot of things just because of a lot of people had reduced staff it was a very slow move it was okay
[415:25.81]It is done.
[415:29.23]We are here.
[415:32.33]Yeah.
[415:33.01]Thanks for the $2.50.
[415:36.05]Unkey Phil, thanks for the $5.00.
[415:37.57]Would you stream Pac-Man World for the GameCube?
[415:41.62]I mean, I love Pac-Man, so you don't have to do much to convince me.
[415:45.71]There's not a whole lot of arm-twisting to get me to play a Pac-Man game.
[415:49.85]Even though I think I've played one Pac-Man game in six years.
[415:53.53]Still, you don't have to twist my arm that hard.
[415:55.58]And the one Pac-Man game that I played in six years was not even a Pac-Man game.
[415:59.14]It was Pac-Man was in the game.
[416:01.02]It was Smash Bros.
[416:02.14]for the Wii U. So, maybe I have to go even longer.
[416:05.58]Thanks a lot, though.
[416:10.72]Rick Bilby, thanks for the $4.
[416:11.98]Jeremy, your streams are an escape and without them I would be in a worse place.
[416:15.42]Please don't buy any more Funko Pops or I'll have to make a Reddit account.
[416:19.37]Don't worry, I haven't bought... If I bought Funko Pops, who gives a shit?
[416:23.67]But I didn't.
[416:25.43]All the things on the shelf that you see behind you were purchased as of about three years ago.
[416:31.19]Not purchased a Funko Pop in three years.
[416:35.81]It's time to get over it.
[416:37.83]It's time to get over this, guys.
[416:41.41]Uh, Crumpo.
[416:42.82]Crumpo.
[416:44.52]Thank you, Crumpo, for the $15.
[416:45.56]I think that burger joke should be on the nominations for best joke with more than five minutes to set up.
[416:49.94]Because I feel like your entire life was set up for that joke.
[416:54.12]I don't.
[416:54.52]I disagree.
[416:59.64]I completely disagree.
[417:03.35]It wasn't a worst or best.
[417:05.41]It was set up.
[417:08.31]We were trying to... We were setting up everybody.
[417:10.99]Thanks for the $15.
[417:11.37]It's a lot of money.
[417:13.73]Shibiriririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririririr
[417:48.46]Thanks for the recipe.
[417:50.20]Wait, what?
[417:50.58]With the Nightwing shirt.
[418:23.75]Take a look at that.
[418:26.13]I'll show this one here.
[418:27.23]This is the most important one.
[418:29.33]This is the most important one for sure.
[418:31.05]Look at this.
[418:40.70]How are they both the bazooka image?
[418:42.10]I don't understand.
[418:46.34]I just saved it as this.
[418:48.56]Oh, hold on.
[418:59.70]Here we go.
[419:06.63]The hair is pretty accurate.
[419:08.49]The bottom right hair is perfect.
[419:10.37]Top left hair is perfect.
[419:17.18]Is that actual Lego serial numbers?
[419:31.80]I don't think Legos do serial.
[419:41.21]No, like serial number.
[419:42.33]This is such a high quality photo.
[419:50.66]I feel like this should be a profile picture somewhere for me.
[419:54.56]But if you have a Lego profile picture, I don't know if I want to do that.
[420:04.88]Oh, look, it's Otto.
[420:10.38]And down.
[420:11.88]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[420:14.70]You don't use Twitter anyways.
[420:15.74]No, I don't.
[420:16.74]That's a very accurate statement.
[420:19.40]Thanks for the Legos.
[420:20.14]And there you go.
[420:20.54]You guys have the pieces if you want to make your own Lego Jerma.
[420:24.82]To, like, I don't know, to, like, to burn or something.
[420:27.22]To be, like, a voodoo doll and try to hurt me.
[420:29.18]Whatever you guys are going to do with that.
[420:31.80]Thanks for the $2.50.
[420:35.15]Sir Canine, thanks for the $2.50.
[420:36.25]Vocal Enrage Streamer takes out rage on US soldiers by playing minigames with their mangled corpses.
[420:44.22]This is a home run game.
[420:45.38]It's in the game.
[420:45.88]It's a home run game.
[420:48.52]SoupGG, thanks for the $2.50.
[420:50.10]Please let us give this guy money on Cameo and have him make you a subsound for one time joke.
[420:56.23]For the purpose of not spoiling what this could be, I'm going to look at this first.
[421:04.45]No.
[421:05.24]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[421:08.34]No.
[421:09.00]I just got an idea.
[421:13.30]I think all the Shark Tank people do cameos.
[421:16.74]What if I just pay them all a ton of fucking money, whatever their cameos are, and have them just react to my shitty Shark Tank presentation?
[421:28.84]Each one of them, I'll just have... Yeah, Gabe, can you talk about, like, my new product?
[421:34.17]And get them to give me, like, 60 seconds and, like, edit a bunch of shit so I can play on, like, a little device or something in my hand.
[421:41.58]Different clips from each one of the sharks while I do my presentation.
[421:44.16]And we'll just have, like, six cell phones set up with, like, FaceTime forward.
[421:55.75]I know at least three or four of them do cameos.
[421:58.36]I'm certain of it.
[422:02.64]Pay them to pretend to love it.
[422:07.00]Hey, it's me.
[422:07.70]It's me, Kevin.
[422:08.22]I just got to tell you about this great product.
[422:11.86]Let me tell you.
[422:13.76]I think it's fantastic.
[422:15.36]I think it's fantastic.
[422:16.48]In fact, listen, I'm going to come for you with 25% equity.
[422:20.96]That's going to be hilarious.
[422:26.20]That's not Trump.
[422:26.80]That's Kevin O'Leary.
[422:34.01]And for that reason, I'm out.
[422:36.59]He talks like that.
[422:38.21]They cost $1,000.
[422:41.45]What?
[422:44.55]I know I'm supposed to get through this quickly, but what do you mean they cost $1,000?
[422:48.37]Cameo.com.
[422:55.13]Okay, like Kevin O'Leary.
[422:56.43]Is he not on here anymore?
[423:03.57]Wait, does he not want to do it anymore?
[423:08.51]No!
[423:09.01]Wait, he doesn't do it anymore?
[423:14.72]Shit!
[423:15.54]What about the other sharks?
[423:20.06]Shark tank.
[423:23.31]Oh, there he is.
[423:23.95]Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful.
[423:25.27]Okay.
[423:27.53]It's $1,200 to get him to do like a 10 second.
[423:30.99]Wait, what?
[423:31.53]$1,200 to do about one to two minutes.
[423:39.55]I'm looking for like five to 10 minutes of footage.
[423:45.00]I would have to pay Kevin O'Leary about $10,000 to $15,000 to make me like 10 of these.
[423:59.70]Who are some of the other sharks?
[424:01.02]I know there's a couple.
[424:06.32]Damon, Robert, Barbara.
[424:08.76]They're- Oh my god!
[424:09.68]Barbara's 600, Robert is 500.
[424:12.93]Damon is 199.
[424:13.41]Alright, Damon.
[424:14.05]Seriously?
[424:26.67]Thanks for at least being 200, not fucking 500.
[424:29.45]Alright, so we got four sharks.
[424:39.60]Alright, how much?
[424:43.90]One of them should just be, like, happy birthday and shit.
[424:48.93]Excuse me, can I just hear from Kevin to see if he has an offer?
[424:52.67]I just want to say happy birthday to you, Jeremy.
[424:55.23]It's a very, very important day.
[424:59.34]Because he was too expensive, so I just had him do one.
[425:02.68]I like this idea.
[425:03.47]And shitty, dumb shit like this starts to get my brain going, and then I get into it, and I really want to do it.
[425:13.61]But this is like a $20,000 to $30,000 project.
[425:16.29]Great.
[425:18.51]Okay.
[425:20.31]Cool.
[425:21.81]Alright.
[425:23.91]We'll take a look at that.
[425:30.15]Oh, yeah.
[425:31.65]Just get impersonators?
[425:32.71]No, they have to be real.
[425:33.65]It has to be the real thing.
[425:37.13]If it's not real, I don't want to do it.
[425:38.83]Don't you understand?
[425:40.59]It has to be like that.
[425:45.94]Okay.
[425:46.96]Well, we know how much that costs.
[425:50.56]Thank you to Pixel Mike for the $5.00.
[425:54.74]Thank you, Crohn's Grove, for the $15.
[425:57.96]Jeremy, hope you're doing well.
[425:59.18]Here's $20 towards your boob enhancement surgery.
[426:01.76]Don't let your body defy me.
[426:04.72]What?
[426:04.88]Why would I need to get a boob enhancement surgery?
[426:13.07]What?
[426:13.27]They're just fine.
[426:17.63]They're just fine.
[426:19.19]What?
[426:22.87]Thanks for the $15.
[426:25.95]Non-descript civilian gave 25 community subs and I missed it because I was probably in the middle of getting angry like a child at a game that came out in 2004.
[426:34.91]So, thanks for the 25 subs.
[426:36.81]That's a lot of money.
[426:37.71]If you do the math, do it right now.
[426:39.27]It's a lot of money.
[426:40.71]Thanks for the 25 subs.
[426:44.81]A brooding brooding chiroptera brooding chiroteptera Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[426:54.48]Remember, I'm the person who said to play Pathologic 2.
[426:56.80]Please don't actually do that.
[426:58.67]You'll get all my favorite characters killed.
[427:01.93]I'm not gonna do that.
[427:05.05]That'd be for Halloween.
[427:08.37]Anyways, I had a dream about you and your girlfriend the other day, but maybe I'll tell you that later.
[427:14.28]MonkaS?
[427:15.94]Potential MonkaS situation here?
[427:17.56]Yeah.
[427:21.30]Thanks for the 10 bucks, though.
[427:22.16]Appreciate it.
[427:23.97]It is Sky.
[427:24.95]Thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[427:26.63]$20.
[427:26.79]Hey, wondered if you planned on streaming Mega Man Legends 2 in the near future.
[427:30.91]It's behind me.
[427:33.51]It is Sky.
[427:34.69]It is behind me.
[427:37.45]Just need to find the right time and reason to do it.
[427:41.74]We're having trouble counting to two recently on this stream.
[427:45.92]And it's got to change.
[427:48.78]Thanks for the 20 bucks, though.
[427:52.14]Lost the music.
[427:56.26]An anonymous cheerer.
[427:57.10]Thanks for the 250.
[427:58.28]And they do the Anon emote.
[428:03.41]Anon emote.
[428:03.99]Thanks for the 250.
[428:04.67]Hey, Lemon.
[428:06.69]Thanks for the $5.
[428:07.57]Jerma, not sure how long you've been playing, but do you know that you can charge your nest jump while in midair, right?
[428:16.09]Yeah.
[428:17.85]I just hold it down.
[428:19.23]You hold it down and you let it go.
[428:20.77]Hold down, let go.
[428:21.47]Hold down, let go.
[428:22.01]Yeah, oh yeah.
[428:23.67]Yeah, I did.
[428:25.69]Thanks for the $5.
[428:26.17]Thanks for the tip.
[428:27.97]Peaceful Haley, thanks for $2.50.
[428:29.13]Hi again.
[428:29.53]Just noticed the stream title.
[428:30.95]Please replace huge and strong with I am.
[428:34.49]Thank you.
[428:34.81]Everybody knows that already, though.
[428:40.90]My friend just showed me the Mega Milk picture.
[428:43.98]Unfriend him.
[428:45.36]Or her.
[429:01.02]Yep.
[429:01.18]I'm so glad you watched it.
[429:01.82]What a fantastic show.
[429:02.30]What a perfect... Every episode is perfect.
[429:26.71]uh sure I have a comedy um I haven't caught up with the last few seasons the last maybe two or three seasons but silicon valley is was hilarious it's a Mike judge ran show Mike judge if you don't know is the guy responsible for beavis and butthead an office space and it's hilarious
[429:48.80]really smart well-written show is really funny uh yeah people are saying always sunny in Philadelphia that's another fantastic show where almost every episode is perfect the exceptions are maybe a few but you can't everything can't be perfect we already went over that earlier
[430:10.50]Trailer Park Boys.
[430:11.46]You know, I can't say yes to that because I've seen like six or seven episodes of Trailer Park Boys and it was like, it was funny.
[430:20.46]It was, but I just, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't watch any more.
[430:26.08]Not because I didn't think it was any good.
[430:32.12]But I didn't grab me hard.
[430:34.72]The one thing that I did think was really funny, and they stuck with this for, from my understanding, almost the entire show, is the guy, not Ricky.
[430:43.69]And not this guy either, not Bobbles.
[430:46.90]Who's the other guy?
[430:48.50]The guy that just always had a drink in his hand.
[430:50.90]Julian, yeah.
[430:52.28]Julian, throughout the course of the whole show, and they ran with this forever, every time he's on camera, he has a drink in his hand.
[431:01.17]Like a whiskey and coke.
[431:03.13]Every single scene he's in, every single fucking episode.
[431:08.47]It's just, that's absolutely hysterical.
[431:13.48]That is by far one of the funniest things you could ever do.
[431:17.48]And to keep that going is just ridiculous.
[431:21.66]Why?
[431:22.26]That would probably be so painful to do after even one season.
[431:30.67]Even after a car crash.
[431:32.67]He was in a car crash?
[431:34.99]Wait, he was in a car crash?
[431:37.69]And then going to the hospital.
[431:39.45]What?! !
[431:47.13]Maybe I... Should I give that show another chance?
[431:51.77]He crawled out of the wrecked car with a drink in his hand.
[431:57.14]I can't believe that they kept that going under any circumstances.
[432:07.42]Yeah, I mean, I chuckled.
[432:09.82]I thought it was funny.
[432:10.50]I thought it was smart and interesting.
[432:12.99]But I just never grabbed on top of it and grabbed it.
[432:16.59]It never grabbed me in the head.
[432:18.49]But maybe I'll give it another chance.
[432:19.81]It was funny.
[432:20.39]Hey, Mick Muscles, thanks for the thousand bits.
[432:23.87]Feeling generous?
[432:26.73]Love you, Jerma.
[432:27.39]And chat.
[432:29.07]And you.
[432:29.47]You too.
[432:32.57]LM, man, thanks for the $3.
[432:34.03]Jerma, gorge your hatred.
[432:36.01]Embrace your rage on chat.
[432:37.39]I already did.
[432:41.27]You had to have been there when I did the... If you put a link in the chat, you're going to get timed up in 10 minutes.
[432:47.26]That was unleashing.
[432:48.36]A lot of people got timed up.
[432:54.40]Thanks a lot.
[432:54.72]That means a lot.
[432:55.20]He's doing good.
[432:55.58]He's actually doing really good now.
[433:13.81]His antibiotic stint is over.
[433:17.39]And he seems to be back to normal.
[433:20.87]But I am going to go to the vet a day or two from now.
[433:24.82]Probably on Monday or Tuesday.
[433:27.28]To just do a recheck.
[433:29.64]Maybe just talk to the vet again and say, Hey, it's been on the antibiotics for a week.
[433:34.78]He's better.
[433:35.26]Is there anything else you want to do?
[433:39.47]He seems like he's fine.
[433:41.43]That's really good.
[433:42.07]I'm really glad to see that.
[433:44.50]Thank you.
[433:45.66]Hey, Yoda985, thanks for the $2.50.
[433:47.08]For your information, Mr. Streamer, my username isn't a short joke.
[433:50.91]But I'll change it if it makes you upset.
[433:52.55]It's not?
[433:55.71]Yoda985 is not a your short joke?
[433:59.81]I'm surprised by that, I'll be honest with you.
[434:05.82]You know how many photoshops of Yoda with my face green on it I've seen?
[434:15.02]At least a handful of times.
[434:16.36]I've seen Mini-Me and Yoda at least a dozen times in the last year, so sorry for jumping to that conclusion.
[434:26.73]You keep that name.
[434:27.37]You don't have to change it.
[434:27.99]It's your name.
[434:31.41]AGM Igon, thanks for the $5.
[434:35.57]You can't keep moving forever.
[434:36.91]The police will find you one day and take you back to Boston for the Santa trial.
[434:41.69]Also, thank you for providing entertainment right now.
[434:43.51]I'm an essential worker and it's been stressful.
[434:46.11]Very stressful out there.
[434:47.86]Your streams are a highlight of my day and they give me something to laugh to.
[434:51.98]P.S.
[434:53.22]I need a new trailer.
[434:54.92]Lady for the rumble or ladder match.
[434:58.75]Alright, we can talk about this.
[435:04.71]I'm going to hold the first time ever.
[435:08.85]And this is a big change.
[435:10.16]And a lot of people might not want to see this change.
[435:11.82]But a lot of people might be happy about this.
[435:15.70]I think we're going to do... A... Almost like a nomination.
[435:23.18]For characters.
[435:24.44]And not a nomination for characters.
[435:26.04]But like a wish list.
[435:28.11]Because I'll be very honest.
[435:30.05]The last time we did a rumble.
[435:32.11]Typically they would happen once every... Seven or eight months.
[435:35.01]Once a year.
[435:36.81]Because it's been so long.
[435:39.85]It's been almost a year and a half or so since the last one, right?
[435:42.69]At least 13, 14, 15 months.
[435:46.14]There's a lot of characters.
[435:47.84]There's a lot of people that have been on streams.
[435:50.18]There's little jokes that have been made.
[435:52.20]Tons of them.
[435:53.90]And it's been a long time since the last Rumble.
[435:57.05]So what I'm probably going to do is once it gets closer to the Boston Marathon, we can actually really lock that all in.
[436:03.41]And we're hopefully back to normal by September.
[436:08.21]Or at least somewhat normal.
[436:09.65]Normal enough to do the marathon, I guess I'm saying.
[436:13.29]Open up a wish list.
[436:15.59]Where on the Discord or something we'll have a channel where we'll just make a big list.
[436:20.65]And then from that list, potentially I will go through and pick out characters that I think I would like to make.
[436:29.02]Or we can even pick them ourselves on stream.
[436:31.70]But I don't think I want to do that with everybody.
[436:34.38]Because I think some of the fun, at least for me, is making characters you don't know.
[436:40.10]that are going to show up.
[436:42.34]So you guys knowing all the entrants to me and all the matches, I think is, I don't really like that as much as I could.
[436:50.35]So maybe at least a wishlist and then maybe at least bring in five to 10 people that chat really wanted.
[436:56.54]And then I'll just make the rest.
[436:59.08]That's kind of the idea.
[437:03.12]We'll see.
[437:04.99]But thanks for the $5, and take care of yourself.
[437:08.29]Being an essential worker right now is very stressful, I can imagine.
[437:14.23]Thanks for the $5.
[437:17.17]$5 from TJ the Duke.
[437:18.64]Thanks for the $5.
[437:19.10]I used to watch your old TF2 vids back in 2012-14.
[437:22.78]Got me through some tough times.
[437:24.60]I just recently looked you up for some nostalgia, and it's good to see you're still doing your thing.
[437:30.57]Yeah, we're still going.
[437:32.83]Not playing really Team Fortress anymore, but still going.
[437:37.48]Still just hanging out, trying to have a good time.
[437:39.34]A few days a week.
[437:46.49]I see no reason to stop.
[437:47.61]Thanks for the five bucks.
[437:52.75]And welcome back.
[437:55.71]Killcon, thanks for $5.
[437:56.83]Jerma, did you know that plants, while plants do not have nerves, they have calcium-gated networks that use glutamate to propagate information across their bodies?
[438:07.15]We've observed that this system is functionally identical to a nervous system, and plants not only sense things, but also learn.
[438:14.78]There's an entire rabbit hole of mounting evidence in support of plant cognition, where plants are as aware and intelligent as animals.
[438:23.14]Isn't that just quackin' crazy?
[438:24.54]What are your thoughts on that?
[438:27.98]Uh, they terrify me.
[438:28.84]That's the scariest thing I've ever heard.
[438:31.68]Because if plants can become completely sentient, then we're all fucking, we're dead.
[438:39.30]That's terrifying.
[438:39.90]Imagine if the trees got sentient.
[438:44.68]What if they didn't want, what if they didn't like us?
[438:50.04]They would come, they'd find some like fucking toxin.
[438:53.89]They'd find... Oh.
[438:56.55]This is, um... That's, uh... Yeah, that happened in a, uh... I think that's a thing that happened.
[439:08.84]That was a piece of fiction.
[439:13.36]Anyways, um... That was... Shit!
[439:18.84]Shit!
[439:19.95]No, don't listen to anything I'm saying.
[439:21.41]Just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[439:22.95]Look at me.
[439:23.31]Gerber's stupid.
[439:24.05]He's going off on a crazy rant again and he's crazy.
[439:27.77]Um, yeah.
[439:29.26]That's scary though.
[439:30.76]Weird thought.
[439:33.06]Thanks Fortify for the $3.
[439:35.87]No message, just three bucks.
[439:36.93]Vilemi, five dollars on top of, uh, fucking fifty dollars.
[439:42.92]Vilemi gave five thousand bits earlier.
[439:45.86]This is fifty-five total dollars tonight from Vilemi.
[439:48.22]Jeremy, you scammed me out of a link, so I demand that you play the You've Been Gnomed video to make up for it.
[439:55.71]Band links.
[440:11.44]That's all you get.
[440:14.08]Oh, God.
[440:14.46]-2.
[440:15.06]That's funny.
[440:49.14]Well, that makes me happy.
[440:50.06]I'm glad to hear that the stream can permeate into other places in your life.
[440:55.65]Hopefully in a good way and not in a bad way.
[440:57.89]I hope nobody actually takes anything really bad from this stream.
[441:03.99]We're having fun, right?
[441:07.76]Hey, Genie Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[441:09.10]Jerma, this is my second time watching your stream.
[441:10.84]Last one was yesterday.
[441:12.00]Hey, what do you think?
[441:16.32]Thoughts?
[441:17.59]Let's hear them.
[441:18.89]I've been watching the videos for a little over a year.
[441:21.15]Okay, alright.
[441:21.65]So you're fairly new.
[441:22.71]I just want to say that your videos and now streams have given me so much joy and have helped me through some dark times.
[441:28.69]I just got my tax return yesterday.
[441:30.25]So I'm excited to support you in these crazy times.
[441:33.10]Peace and love.
[441:36.36]Thanks for the $2.50.
[441:38.80]Really hope that you take care of yourself.
[441:41.40]Most importantly.
[441:46.75]You got your tax return.
[441:50.49]Take care of yourself.
[441:51.31]Make sure you're taken care of.
[441:52.37]It would be very, very low down on that list.
[441:57.86]And if you get there, alright, I'll gladly take it.
[442:00.88]Thanks a lot.
[442:04.12]And welcome to the streams, video watcher.
[442:09.53]Thanks a lot, Genie Boy.
[442:12.43]Plop one down.
[442:13.27]Thanks for $3.
[442:13.57]They say, thanks, man.
[442:15.03]Thank you.
[442:17.71]Get the credits on the screen.
[442:19.11]Let's roll them.
[442:21.27]Seven and a half hours.
[442:22.15]I told you this was never going to happen ever again.
[442:24.20]And how long did that last?
[442:27.84]A week.
[442:29.32]This was never supposed to happen ever again.
[442:32.62]I actually said it was never going to happen again.
[442:34.64]I said there will never be a stream more than six hours ever again.
[442:41.51]I was wrong.
[442:47.35]But...
[442:49.11]Well, hold on.
[442:50.65]Okay.
[442:51.61]Hear me out on this.
[442:52.91]The reason why this wasn't like a four to five hour stream today is because at around the four to five hour mark on the stream, I realized I probably only have another hour or so left in Hulk.
[443:07.58]Am I just going to stop the stream and not finish this game?
[443:14.22]Right now?
[443:16.67]So, it's okay.
[443:17.91]I did say that there was never going to be a stream again more than 5 or 6 hours.
[443:22.73]But there are some exceptions.
[443:24.61]Like wanting to complete a game that I know I can complete in less than 6 to 7 hours.
[443:30.62]Okay.
[443:31.20]There are some exceptions.
[443:33.24]That won't always happen though.
[443:36.84]But thanks again everybody for subbing.
[443:37.96]It means a lot.
[443:41.46]Thank you.
[443:43.07]Thanks for giving me money.
[443:44.05]Thanks for paying me money.
[443:49.16]Thanks.
[443:50.22]A million times.
[443:52.60]Immortal Dracolich.
[443:53.96]Thanks for the $5.
[443:54.74]Jerma, do you have any interest in playing the Prototype series?
[443:57.94]They're also by Radical.
[443:59.44]They have a very similar feel to Ultimate Destruction.
[444:02.22]Yeah, I actually tried to play Prototype a long time ago.
[444:05.66]It didn't work.
[444:06.20]I couldn't get it to work, so I'll probably just get it for Xbox and do that.
[444:10.36]Or Xbox 360 or something.
[444:14.26]Eventually.
[444:16.08]We'll go back to it.
[444:18.00]Thanks for the three bucks.
[444:19.32]Really?
[444:19.54]I'll see if I can get it to work.
[444:25.82]I'll try.
[444:47.76]I'll try it.
[444:52.30]I'll give it a look.
[444:52.89]If I can get it set up and get ready and do it by tomorrow, then whatever.
[444:57.21]I'll try it.
[445:01.15]Thanks for the $5, Bugsmoke.
[445:02.67]And for the good tip.
[445:04.71]Mostly lost.
[445:05.27]Thanks for $2.50.
[445:06.07]Put a 1 in chat if you haven't seen Manos, the Hands of Fate.
[445:09.31]There's also a lot of liars here.
[445:19.69]Seeing at least one liar.
[445:26.80]Me?
[445:27.02]Oh.
[445:30.33]Alright, but for trial period, I want to watch something that I haven't seen and that a lot of people haven't seen.
[445:35.93]A lot of people have seen Manos, the Hands of Fate.
[445:38.69]Let's just be honest.
[445:40.37]I know that people think it's hilarious and people really like it.
[445:43.38]It's such a bad, bad, shitty public domain movie.
[445:45.96]Right, everyone says that.
[445:47.80]But a lot of people have seen it.
[445:49.68]Not a whole, by contrast, shitload of people haven't seen the gorilla.
[445:56.21]I'm just giving you statements that are accurate.
[446:05.38]For some reason I thought this was just an absolute gibberish sentence.
[446:33.55]Can't wait to see Purple Hulk in Revengers End War.
[446:36.26]The Forever Glove is pretty cool.
[446:39.64]Wait, is it?
[446:40.68]Oh, it is.
[446:41.26]It's like a joke.
[446:43.02]Right?
[446:43.78]Like the Infinity Gauntlet.
[446:45.80]The Avengers.
[446:46.48]Okay, it is.
[446:47.28]I don't know.
[446:48.62]They name so much weird shit these days.
[446:51.51]Like Ultimate Zombie Avengers.
[446:53.37]I don't know.
[446:53.75]Alright, it's a joke.
[446:55.37]Okay.
[446:56.35]Hey, Mitchell.
[446:56.93]Thanks for $20, Mitchell.
[446:57.73]2,000 bits.
[446:57.87]Thanks for the 20 bucks.
[447:04.71]Thanks for playing Hulk Ultimate Destruction, Jerma.
[447:06.83]Glad you enjoyed it.
[447:07.59]Ridiculous as it can get.
[447:09.41]I played it too alongside the stream and the completion time difference may have been double digits, but I really enjoyed watching you play.
[447:24.78]Double digits as in, like, you know, that's 30 seconds.
[447:28.00]That could be 10 seconds.
[447:30.58]So you beat the game 12 seconds faster than I did.
[447:34.10]Alright, double digits faster.
[447:35.82]If Toontown does not end up being a game for tomorrow, if it does end up being it, it'll be a blast.
[447:41.18]Take care and have a great night, man.
[447:46.44]I'll try.
[447:46.78]I'm gonna give it a real try.
[447:49.82]Thanks for the $20.
[447:50.72]And yeah, the game was fun.
[447:51.72]It was hilarious.
[447:54.69]Alright, well, we haven't seen it.
[448:04.83]I haven't seen it.
[448:05.39]Alright, you are like one of five people that have seen that movie here.
[448:13.34]Hey, Blackout, thanks for the three dollars.
[448:17.82]Uh... Joey Zio and AtToonTown are their Twitters with the head dev and the server.
[448:22.73]The server capacity is 10,000.
[448:24.33]And originally had 4,000 active users.
[448:27.81]TimTheTatman with 12,000 viewers was able to stream the game, so you should be able to go tomorrow.
[448:32.44]Okay, well, alright.
[448:36.18]Alright, yeah, alright.
[448:38.02]I was under the assumption that it was like an old, like, pieced together project that maybe like a few hundred to a thousand people could do.
[448:44.95]I don't know.
[448:45.67]Is that popular?
[448:47.57]I didn't know it was that popular.
[448:49.62]You can help with any configs.
[448:52.24]Well, tomorrow around like 3 o'clock, I'll be here.
[448:57.72]Getting ready.
[448:59.84]So, if there's something wrong, 3 p.m.
[449:02.36]Pacific, by the way.
[449:05.06]I'll try to, over that, like, from like 2.30 to like 3.30 is when I'm going to try to figure this all out.
[449:09.36]So, if there's any problems or any configuration issues, then I absolutely will ask in the chat.
[449:18.66]But, no, I mean, if somebody like TimTheTatman can do it and not crash the server, then we should be fine.
[449:24.43]Yeah, that's because I have less than half of those numbers, so that should be fine.
[449:35.25]GuillotineSenpai, thanks for the $2.50 new emote.
[449:37.42]Promise it's not BerniePog.
[449:40.48]Then it's... Oh, the link got removed.
[449:43.24]Alright, all links are banned.
[449:45.68]I forgot.
[449:45.98]Alright.
[449:50.85]I'm sorry.
[449:51.97]Thank you for the $2.50 though.
[449:53.82]Very PK.
[449:54.60]Thanks for the $5.
[449:55.48]Combine the Shark Tank stream with the webcam stream.
[449:57.84]Then get them to film interview.
[449:59.90]Ask answers.
[450:02.52]Get them to film interview answers and have your responses at different angles.
[450:06.18]Just food for thought.
[450:07.52]Want to get those gears turning.
[450:09.14]Bernie Pog.
[450:10.97]No, we're not making Bernie Pog a thing.
[450:14.75]Get rid of the Bernie Pog thing in your head.
[450:17.07]We're not doing Bernie Pog.
[450:20.86]No, we're not doing that.
[450:22.08]Thanks for the $5.
[450:22.90]Dwarverine, thanks for $5.
[450:24.66]Hey, Bub, I would like to request my favorite character for the Rumble.
[450:27.02]Dwarverine, the Wolverine, Dwar.
[450:31.81]Ask Visceral Concepts to make a game that's fun.
[450:35.37]We'll see if that's possible.
[450:37.19]Thanks for the $5.
[450:37.95]Thank you, Sir Canine, for $2.50.
[450:40.69]Chat not realizing the minus and plus twos actually affect Jerma's lifespan.
[450:45.14]Unca S.
[450:52.78]Kind of scary, if you think about it.
[450:54.92]Hey, Genie Boy, again, thanks for 250.
[450:56.46]The stream was great.
[450:57.26]Also, Bugleberry for Rumble, please.
[450:59.74]You should play LEGO Star Wars, the complete saga.
[451:03.28]Bugleberry was in the last Rumble, and he actually lasted a pretty long time.
[451:08.74]I'm sure he'll be back.
[451:09.82]He's a staple of this entire stream now.
[451:13.42]He will definitely be a participant, without a doubt, in my mind.
[451:16.54]Resident Evil 4.
[451:19.92]I plan on it.
[451:22.09]slom.com thanks for three dollars hey Jerma eight year viewer first time bit giver love your work I'd love a good old happy birthday happy birthday slom.com thanks for being around for that long that's eight years that's a lot that's almost a decade that's almost 10 years the 10-year anniversary is actually coming up sooner than a lot of people think
[451:51.24]June 2011 was when the stream, when the videos, the channel started.
[452:00.57]So if June 2011 was the first video and June 2021 is 10 years, that's a 10 year anniversary.
[452:11.45]Stream from inside of a cake.
[452:14.23]We'll see what I do for 10 years.
[452:20.31]But thanks for the three bucks and thanks for sticking around.
[452:24.79]And that is the end.
[452:26.53]I'll see you guys tomorrow for maybe Toontown Reloaded.
[452:30.91]If Toontown doesn't work, then we'll figure something else out.
[452:33.67]Tomorrow is going to be where I am going to follow my rules for tomorrow.
[452:38.35]We're going back to like the rules, which are like four to six hours.
[452:41.72]I just wanted to finish the Hulk.
[452:45.70]Right at the very end, we had 250 from Goobery Juice.
[452:48.52]Thanks, Goobery Juice.
[452:50.83]This one?
[453:20.99]Hold on.
[453:21.75]It's been almost seven and a half hours.
[453:23.53]I can't do it.
[453:25.31]Cow and Chicken was an amazing show.
[453:26.39]Charlie Adler is a legend.
[453:29.15]Charlie Adler did every fucking voice on that show.
[453:32.83]Did you know that?
[453:35.17]Charlie Adler did Red Butt Guy, Cow, and Chicken.
[453:42.31]Now you have to be at the top of your game to be able to do something like that.
[453:50.91]Charlie Adler is one of those inspir- It's like, probably like in top five.
[453:57.17]Like how it inspired everything that I do.
[454:01.41]I love Charlie Adler's characters.
[454:03.54]Charlie Adler, when he goes like this, and he's able to carry his wife- Like, nobody can do it.
[454:09.22]Only Charlie can do that.
[454:11.00]I'm speaking- Like, only Charlie, you know, my buddy Charlie.
[454:13.84]No, Charlie Adler is, um, Ickis from Ah, Real Monsters.
[454:24.06]He's Ed Big Head.
[454:26.64]He's so good.
[454:32.25]I don't know how much work he's doing now.
[454:37.45]Man.
[454:39.95]That guy modeled pretty much the whole way that I speak.
[454:45.39]Jim Carrey.
[454:46.59]Charlie Adler.
[454:48.77]And...
[454:51.77]my dad yeah my dad Charlie adler Jim carrey um who else bernie sanders Larry David Larry probably Larry David
[455:10.36]I'm such a huge Larry David fan.
[455:12.74]I would turn green if Larry David walked in my room.
[455:15.94]You know what I mean?
[455:17.18]If I was at a convention and Larry David was there and he's like, oh, you want me to sign something?
[455:21.62]You?
[455:22.32]I'd be like, hi.
[455:23.18]I would just turn fucking green and be like, Larry, hi.
[455:29.16]I'm Jeremy.
[455:35.28]He's like my idol.
[455:38.48]I think he's the funniest person on Earth.
[455:46.99]Anyways.
[455:51.00]Don't put losers in the rumble, please.
[455:53.64]Wait, what?
[455:55.94]Oh, you mean, like, the people that actually lost the rumble.
[455:58.74]For a second, I was like, wait, I thought you were talking about Larry David.
[456:01.28]I was like, what the fuck did that, what did you just say?
[456:07.12]You mean, like, actually, physically, people that didn't, people that lost.
[456:11.63]No, we have to have, alright, if, if, like, John Cena gets eliminated...
[456:17.45]as number 10 he's gonna be in the next run that's like John Cena nice job you you know you're one of the most popular people in the WWE but sorry you never get to be in another rumble ever again you sit these ones out
[456:35.97]No, you do like 5 to 10 people that were in previous Rumbles.
[456:42.75]People that I really like.
[456:43.70]Characters I think are really fun and interesting.
[456:45.28]And then you do like 10 to 20 new ones.
[456:48.30]And then, some people don't even participate in the Rumble.
[456:51.60]There's probably like 5 to 10 new characters that show up just in the matches beforehand.
[456:56.68]I really like that system.
[457:03.61]And finally, the buzzer.
[457:05.25]For real though, thanks for 250.
[457:06.66]Jerma, wait.
[457:07.20]I got a link to some possible fixes for Prototype.
[457:10.22]Is there a mod I can pass the link on so they can give it to you?
[457:14.16]Yeah, give it to one of the mods.
[457:16.79]If not, I probably will.
[457:19.81]Let me just... We'll say this right now.
[457:22.67]I'll probably just get it for Xbox 360 if it exists for it.
[457:27.10]Some of these old games are just so finicky.
[457:30.38]And by old, anything more than 8 to 12 years old, just, it can be such a pain in the ass.
[457:36.64]If it's on a console, I just have to put the disk in and it just works and it won't crash.
[457:42.51]Well, this game crashed like three times.
[457:44.23]This game had like two bugs and hard crashed.
[457:47.67]But, it's just a disk.
[457:51.19]Thank you for forgiving me, Jeremy.
[457:54.31]Did I?
[457:54.59]Did I?
[457:58.31]I'm that person up for 30 minutes I can't like I can't like choke on water right now and spit it up guys don't you understand the joke the stream is about to turn off in like 30 seconds I don't hold grudges
[458:34.86]And that's it.
[458:35.50]I'll see you tomorrow.
[458:37.34]Have a wonderful, wonderful rest of your night.
[458:42.84]Of course I forgive them.
[458:44.20]Of course I forgive you.
[458:45.84]Just put the brakes on a little, okay?
[458:50.34]Just put the brakes on.
[458:51.11]Hey, Goobery Juice, thanks for $2.50 with a Kappa face.
[458:55.41]Thanks for the $2.50.
[458:57.31]I'll see you tomorrow.
[459:00.90]Good night.
[459:01.44]Goodbye.
[459:02.72]See you around 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
[459:04.54]Maybe for Toontown Reloaded.
[459:05.78]Good night.
