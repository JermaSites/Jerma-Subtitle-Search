[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.56]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.64]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:10.04]Okay, seriously, this teleport.
[00:12.80]It's teleswap, right?
[00:15.20]Uh, I think so.
[00:16.40]It's the thing in the top right.
[00:20.49]Wait, what?
[00:21.09]What just happened?
[00:22.49]I don't know.
[00:22.79]What's going on?
[00:23.95]What is that?
[00:24.85]Why do I see, like, the refresh button on my screen right now?
[00:27.87]Oh, God.
[00:28.25]Why do you have my mind?
[00:29.55]Or you have a mind now?
[00:32.38]Oh god, I have no... Oh shit.
[00:34.14]Okay, here we go.
[00:36.52]Leeroy!
[00:37.56]No!
[00:39.18]No!
[00:39.55]It's gonna hurt him if he's gonna hit him.
[00:42.83]Maybe not, huh?
[00:43.97]Okay.
[00:44.39]It's like playing with you.
[00:45.41]It's like it's not working at all.
[00:46.99]Oh boy.
[00:47.31]Did Orb's guy just drown?
[00:49.47]No, he will.
[00:50.09]He will next... Both of your guys are gonna drown.
[00:53.35]What weapons are... What?
[00:55.41]Oh my god.
[00:56.29]Oh my god, I'm getting that.
[00:58.31]What?
[00:58.77]I'm going to get whatever's in that crate.
[01:02.87]Get the crate, dude.
[01:03.83]You shouldn't get the crate.
[01:05.69]Do I have any ninja rope?
[01:09.55]I don't think I have any ninja rope left.
[01:14.95]And orb's guy's dead.
[01:19.08]Why is my teleport not working?
[01:20.76]This is unfair.
[01:23.20]This is unfair, guys.
[01:25.16]I gotta make this happen.
[01:26.32]Jerm, what's your play?
[01:27.20]I just gotta go.
[01:29.96]I just gotta move.
[01:31.88]No, I just gotta go.
[01:33.04]You're girdering?
[01:33.80]No, not exit the game.
[01:36.19]Why you put a girder down?
[01:39.19]Bye, Jerba.
[01:40.55]Where are you leaving?
[01:41.61]I gotta get this health.
[01:42.55]It's like my only means of survival.
[01:44.41]I gotta make this jump.
[01:48.09]Oh.
[01:51.09]Oh, shit.
[01:51.95]Orb is so boned.
[01:53.53]I need to teleport.
[01:54.57]Seriously, how do I teleport?
[01:56.05]The top right?
[01:56.93]The top right thing.
[01:58.91]What would be the top right?
[01:59.97]The top right item.
[02:02.37]When you open your right click.
[02:04.27]Oh, that's not the one I'm clicking on.
[02:05.87]Oh.
[02:06.79]I'll click 2x Teleswap.
[02:09.62]I don't know what that means.
[02:10.42]2x Teleswap.
[02:11.52]I have no idea what that is.
[02:13.66]I would go get the weapon over there on the left.
[02:15.44]Going up in the little corner?
[02:19.74]Oh, dude, that's a bad place to go.
[02:22.03]I have to do something.
[02:26.27]I'm about to die.
[02:27.69]You want to drown right there.
[02:28.65]That's a good move.
[02:29.63]Yeah, that's true.
[02:36.09]Alright, we have an interesting game going on here, boys.
[02:38.89]I got a feeling that Shibi... No, he's playing with this guy.
[02:41.51]Oh, you're teleporting now, huh?
[02:47.64]Alright.
[02:48.40]GG, Shibi.
[02:49.94]GG, Shibi.
[02:50.48]I think Shibi has this.
[02:51.84]That's kind of a conservative play right there.
[02:53.62]I like that.
[02:54.30]Alright, do I have anything, like, insane that I can just do right now?
[03:00.34]Oh, if I only had... Mmm...
[03:05.94]You know what?
[03:06.68]It might be worth it.
[03:07.94]It really might be worth it to do this.
[03:10.08]No, it's not.
[03:11.40]Oh, no ninja rope.
[03:14.24]What are you doing?
[03:15.14]What are you thinking?
[03:16.12]Can I, like... Oh, you want to dig?
[03:18.83]No.
[03:19.67]I want to, like... Can I go, like, up here?
[03:21.23]Yeah, you can go at an angle, but not up.
[03:26.13]Oh, that's pretty good.
[03:27.70]Okay.
[03:28.74]Wait, so you can only use it for like a few seconds.
[03:30.60]That's right.
[03:34.02]I want to stay protected, but I want that weapon crate.
[03:39.79]Toolbox?
[03:40.55]What's that toolbox?
[03:44.79]What was that?
[03:45.67]Blowtorch?
[03:47.29]Yeah.
[03:49.37]I used the blowtorch, yeah.
[03:53.18]You son of a bitch.
[03:56.46]That's the ceiling.
[03:57.94]Yeah, that's the ceiling right there, the blue.
[04:00.98]Alright, well, here's how this has to go.
[04:02.79]Someone has to kill Orr before we all drown.
[04:05.29]No, what?
[04:07.51]Don't even focus on me right now.
[04:09.39]You have the weapons of mass destruction over there.
[04:13.45]I wonder what it is.
[04:14.65]What if it is a nuke?
[04:16.53]It's gonna be like a bomb.
[04:18.02]What was it?
[04:18.84]Holy hand grenade.
[04:20.38]Oh, no.
[04:21.48]Was it...
[04:22.90]You roll that over here, it's gonna kill me.
[04:25.53]Roll it to Jerma.
[04:27.09]It's such a huge blast radius.
[04:29.23]Roll it to Jerma.
[04:31.42]He's all the way over there, come on.
[04:32.90]Get all the McSwagons right here.
[04:34.66]If you hit him.
[04:42.53]I Thought I put a little more oomph on that my god.
[04:51.72]Oh my god.
[04:52.10]Give me give me that.
[04:53.96]What is that?
[04:54.66]I don't know all the packages over there.
[04:56.46]Oh It's just a homing missile.
[04:59.12]Great.
[05:00.08]Shoot it that shitty.
[05:00.80]Thanks, Santa.
[05:02.60]Shoot it at the 50 guy.
[05:05.04]I keep blowtorching What is that?
[05:11.87]Wow.
[05:12.25]And, no!
[05:13.19]Damn it, I ran out of time!
[05:14.21]Oh, I'm so boned now.
[05:17.59]Standing right out in the open.
[05:19.41]Well, guys.
[05:20.45]Hey, Orb.
[05:21.21]What's going on up there?
[05:22.73]Sup, dudes?
[05:23.79]Alright, Jerem.
[05:24.89]Here's how this has to go.
[05:25.79]We both have to start RPGing where Orb's going.
[05:29.11]Oh, please don't.
[05:30.91]I will just chill here.
[05:32.07]It's only gonna take one.
[05:34.37]No, it's not!
[05:35.23]I'm gonna shoot one up there, and it's probably gonna kill him.
[05:38.08]Nope.
[05:39.96]Good luck.
[05:40.56]Have fun.
[05:43.39]Go for Jerma.
[05:44.37]Go for Jerma.
[05:46.14]Oh, you're doing that.
[05:47.02]No, go for me.
[05:49.50]Go for Jerma.
[05:50.08]Go for Jerma.
[05:50.84]Go for Jerma.
[05:51.52]You can kill me after.
[05:54.16]Go for Jerma first.
[05:57.73]Alright, Jerma, you know what to do.
[05:59.57]You know what to do, Jerm.
[06:02.07]Jerm, you know what to do here.

[06:06.87]Complete the mission.
[06:08.35]Alright, where- where is this- America.
[06:11.15]America.
[06:12.19]We kinda look the same, we're kinda like twins, don't do this.
[06:14.52]America.
[06:14.90]Would you do this to your own family?
[06:16.40]Would you do this to your own family?
[06:18.26]America.
[06:20.40]Do you hate foreigners?
[06:21.56]What is that?!
[06:22.64]What?!
[06:22.82]What's happening?! !
[06:28.98]Jerma with the wildcard jetpack.
[06:31.30]Did I stay alive?
[06:34.56]It's the arrow keys, and you don't hit space.
[06:39.32]Oh, God.
[06:40.78]Okay.
[06:41.14]I don't even know what I just picked up.
[06:42.48]Alright, Orb.
[06:44.08]Yeah.
[06:44.68]Orb, you're so dead.
[06:47.72]Gerder.
[06:48.46]If I were you, I would teleport somewhere.
[06:54.14]Or just block it off.
[07:00.75]This water is coming up pretty damn high.
[07:02.41]They're not gonna get me.
[07:03.83]Seriously, I'm gonna win this.
[07:05.24]Somehow I'm gonna win this.
[07:08.28]What is that?
[07:08.76]That looks like the upgraded bazooka or something.
[07:12.64]Gonna do what's the plan of action here should be shoot me go for church.
[07:17.12]I don't know if you're gonna make that shot It's a it's got too much of an arc Alright, I'm okay.

[07:48.46]Damn it.
[07:49.00]I can't help it.
[07:50.18]Yeah, I know it's going down.
[07:51.74]I believe I
[08:04.76]I was trying to jetpack over.
[08:06.23]I was gonna dig down and get that... I was gonna get that weapon down there.
[08:13.06]Come get me.
[08:14.12]Come get me, guys.
[08:16.24]I'm still gonna win this.
[08:18.60]Alright, I've really had enough of you.
[08:21.86]You're not helping my case and I should be killing Orb.
[08:24.38]Wait a minute.
[08:25.58]Think about this for a second.
[08:28.28]Alright, explain why you're valuable to me right now.
[08:30.81]Alright, alright, hold on.
[08:34.63]Let me explain.
[08:35.61]Let me explain.
[08:37.75]First of all, we've known each other for quite a long time.
[08:40.99]It's probably gonna take me like about 25-30 seconds to explain this.
[08:43.61]So just hold on for a second.
[08:45.80]One time, remember at E3, we met.
[08:46.96]Enough.
[08:47.28]No!
[08:57.13]Okay.
[08:57.65]This is not fair.
[08:58.63]I wanted this to jetpack.
[08:59.83]It'd be fun.
[09:00.61]Alright.
[09:03.49]The water is rising, Orb.
[09:05.45]The water is rising.
[09:07.52]Oh, the game's over.
[09:08.60]There's no way Orb gets out of this alive.
[09:10.84]How am I not winning this?
[09:13.46]The only way you can win this, Orb, is if you dig down a little bit and drop grenades and hopefully just play like... You know Super Mario?
[09:19.96]When you go up on top in the second level and nothing can hurt you?
[09:23.08]That's what you have to do.
[09:24.69]You have to stay above on Super Mario the second level.
[09:28.87]Where's the best place to stand?
[09:30.45]Probably here.
[09:32.01]I would drop the mole.
[09:32.87]Drop the mole.
[09:33.57]Alright.
[09:37.47]I'm going to play it safe.
[09:38.61]Alright.
[09:39.25]I'm going to play it safe.
[09:41.53]I'm going to win this, Jeremiah.
[09:43.51]You wait and see.
[09:45.20]Up quick.
[09:46.30]And I have an escape plan.
[09:47.70]I have an escape plan.
[09:48.70]All it takes is him to shoot one big cluster bomb up there.
[09:54.71]If he hits you with two more rockets, you're done.
[09:57.41]Look at this.
[09:57.81]The barrier is going to take the entire shot.
[09:59.75]Look at this.
[10:00.91]The first barrier is going to take that entire shot.
[10:03.19]And that's one round.
[10:04.41]And then the water will rise.
[10:08.00]I got this.
[10:08.64]I got this.
[10:09.62]If he drowns you, that's just ridiculous.
[10:13.12]Yeah.
[10:14.34]Look at the barrier taking everything.
[10:15.74]Look at the barrier taking everything.
[10:20.14]You're going to run out of barriers.
[10:22.69]Well, I don't have any more berries, actually.
[10:25.09]Oh, no.
[10:26.71]He still has nothing.
[10:29.30]Look at this.
[10:30.02]Look at this.
[10:30.72]What should I do?
[10:31.52]What should I do?
[10:32.62]I'm telling you, you could drop the mole on him right there.
[10:36.24]That might do a lot of damage.
[10:38.74]Drop the mole on him?
[10:39.86]Yeah, drop the mole.
[10:41.18]The mole digs down and explodes.
[10:43.86]Oh, it does?
[10:44.74]I would not stand right next to it, though.
[10:46.27]I'd get over to the left a little bit.
[10:49.66]Not gonna drop it.
[10:50.34]No, I'm gonna plate say drop the mob.
[10:52.54]I would drop some more mob.
[10:54.03]You're gonna move me Okay, you know what?
[10:56.63]I'm gonna play it safe.
[10:58.35]I got up this I got this I have a plan Oh Look at the water Look at the water.
[11:05.67]How are you gonna act?
[11:08.47]How are you gonna act you're not gonna get me ever you are so done You are so done
[11:16.78]That's not going to hurt.
[11:18.62]No, no, it's too much cover.
[11:20.38]I don't know.
[11:20.82]It's not going to hurt me.
[11:22.36]Oh, you have one health.
[11:24.06]You have one health.
[11:26.48]Here we go.
[11:27.42]Oh, shit.
[11:29.30]Okay.
[11:30.44]Surrender.
[11:32.42]Take the easy way out and surrender.
[11:34.16]I told you to drop the ball.
[11:35.74]He didn't want to listen.
[11:37.24]Oh, my God.
[11:38.09]Surrender.
[11:39.33]It's not over until it's over.
[11:40.71]Drop the ball.
[11:41.39]It's not over until it's over.
[11:45.48]Oh my god.
[11:46.66]That's gonna put you in a worse position.
[11:48.78]You're so boned.
[11:52.07]He's gonna hit you with one rocket.
[11:54.73]No shit!
[11:57.33]Oh no!
[11:58.13]No!
[11:59.03]Here we go.
[11:59.79]This is it.
[12:01.21]This is how it ends.
[12:02.55]GG.
[12:03.91]Oh my god.

[12:09.08]Wow, dude.
[12:09.86]You're lame.
[12:10.38]This is how it ends.
[12:13.18]This is not how it ends.
[12:17.86]Yes!
[12:19.68]The water pressure's really starting to get to shit me.
[12:26.10]Oh, snap.
[12:26.74]Okay, I'm going in for the clutch mole now.
[12:29.06]You gotta go in for the mole kill right here.
[12:32.21]The one HP.
[12:33.55]You gotta mole the hell out of him.
[12:35.53]What the... Just click space and it will go... When you hit space, he's gonna move, and then you hit space again, he starts to dig.
[12:41.85]Okay.
[12:43.25]And then, you gotta make sure, oh man!
[12:45.71]Dude, he's gonna blow up!
[12:47.31]He's gonna blow up!
[12:48.11]You have to hit specs!

[12:59.60]The mole sucks.
[13:00.62]You have to hit specs.
[13:02.26]The mole sucks.
[13:03.22]I pressed specs.
[13:04.62]Shut up.
[13:05.34]You have to hit specs.
[13:06.33]Shut up.

[13:40.51]I was- I had a plan and then you suggested a mole and everything just... not working out.
[13:45.37]Listen, the mole would've worked if you hit space instead of letting him run around in circles.
[13:49.51]It's 2 for 0 for 0 right now.
[13:54.93]Oh man.
[13:57.02]I had a plan.
[13:57.70]It didn't work out though.
[13:59.90]I had a plan.
[14:01.54]God damn it.
[14:02.34]GG.
[14:02.48]GG.
