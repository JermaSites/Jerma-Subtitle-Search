[00:07.17]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:09.89]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.69]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer with the Widowmaker, the Mini-Sentry Gunslinger, and the Pistol.
[00:22.76]It's gonna be on Barn Blitz Defense on the last point.
[00:26.08]But we are not going to talk about the gameplay.
[00:28.44]We're going to talk about the update stuff and how tomorrow, Wednesday, meet the Pyros coming out and we got a bunch of new stuff, bunch of new items, some new sets.
[00:38.84]My brain is racked right now.
[00:39.99]I cannot wait to talk about this.
[00:41.53]Now, how I typically do my update videos, guys, is I wait till it's all out.
[00:46.41]Wait till I can actually get my hands on this stuff before I give, obviously, my demonstrations and my first opinions on them and stuff like that.
[00:54.07]So that video will be out tomorrow.
[00:55.77]The second I can get my hands on all these items and make a video, it will be live on this channel.
[01:00.43]But in the meantime, let's talk about what we've seen so far.
[01:04.85]So Monday, they showed us, in my opinion, the best part about this entire update.
[01:10.78]We're getting a new official game mode to Team Fortress 2.
[01:14.88]The last official game mode was DeGroot Keep, and a lot of people don't even consider that a game mode.
[01:21.08]And we've gotten stuff like Saxon Hill, we've gotten stuff like Prop Hunt and WarioWare.
[01:26.60]Those are all great community mods, but we haven't seen an official one in so long.
[01:30.95]So this is just so exciting to me.
[01:32.71]I can't wait to play this, can't wait to try it.
[01:34.97]I have no idea how the game mode works, but the way it sounds on the Valve website, it's kind of like Left 4 Dead 2 scavenge mode, where you had one team had to fill up a tank, and the other team had to stop them from doing that.
[01:47.00]And if the first team fills the tank up and the rocket takes off,
[01:50.12]then they win the game.
[01:51.68]And then they flip, of course, sides and vice versa.
[01:54.30]So I think that's kind of how it's going to work.
[01:56.62]Maybe red team is defense or maybe not.
[01:59.54]Maybe it's you're both fighting for the same rocket.
[02:02.35]Blue team and red team.
[02:03.27]That would be pretty interesting.
[02:04.17]You know, you have a bar on the top that goes back and forth depending on how much fuel the certain side has put in.
[02:09.69]This is all speculation at this point because I have no idea.
[02:12.69]But I do know one thing.
[02:14.15]It's probably going to be a lot of fun.
[02:16.90]So today, Tuesday, we got a bunch of different items for some of the classes.
[02:20.82]We got some scout stuff, sniper, soldier, and pyro.
[02:24.74]And I actually really want to talk about the pyro item.
[02:27.42]I'll go over the stuff obviously tomorrow.
[02:29.04]I'm going to do a big, huge video on all this stuff.
[02:31.84]But I want to talk about the pyro item mostly.
[02:34.37]Link will be in the description for all these items, and you can scroll down and see what I'm talking about.
[02:38.71]This pyro item is a secondary, I think.
[02:42.21]But the stats on it are very, very odd.
[02:45.31]So for instance, it's called the Scorch Shot, right?
[02:47.65]Flare knocks back target on hit and ignites enemies in a small radius, and there's a minus 50% damage penalty on this thing.
[02:55.78]So my question is this.
[02:57.36]If this is a secondary, why would you ever equip this rather than the flare gun or the detonator or the shotgun?
[03:04.24]Knocking somebody back for a secondary, it's essentially a compression blast.
[03:08.28]But as a pyro, we use our compression blast to utilize our secondaries.
[03:13.97]So if I compression blast somebody and then switch to this and shoot them, I'm gonna compression blast them twice.
[03:19.15]I don't think it crits.
[03:20.23]I'm not sure if it even does any of those things the flare gun does.
[03:23.29]and the minus 50% damage penalty, I feel like this is a primary.
[03:27.66]I feel like it should be a primary, because I can't think of a use for it if it was a secondary.
[03:32.22]If it were a primary, think about launching somebody in the air with this, then switching to something like the Reserve Shooter, or the detonator, or the flare gun, and getting the crit.
[03:41.62]That would make some sense.
[03:42.80]That would be interesting, especially because of the minus 50% damage.
[03:46.26]You could essentially turn this into a compression blaster, and that's its job, and that's what it's used for.
[03:51.78]But I think I have to stop making all these assumptions on this item before I even sit down and use it.
[03:56.81]But that's my favorite part about Team Fortress.
[03:58.91]Sitting down, speculating on items, because we don't even know.
[04:02.15]There could be more stuff tomorrow that complements this item.
[04:05.40]I don't even know yet.
[04:06.08]Nobody knows.
[04:06.64]That's the beauty of Team Fortress.
[04:08.92]So tomorrow is Wednesday, which is the launch of the update, and of course the launch of Meet the Pyro.
[04:14.59]So here's a little fun fact for you.
[04:16.29]Meet the Pyro comes out tomorrow, Meet the Medic came out exactly one year ago, and before that, Meet the Spy came out two full years behind Meet the Medic.
[04:26.39]So it's kind of interesting, they took two years to make Meet the Medic, and pretty much less than one to make Meet the Pyro.
[04:32.55]I remember looking at that coming in 2012 image that's on the main page, and I thought to myself, there's no freaking way they're going to introduce Meet the Pyro in the first or second quarter.
[04:42.64]There's no way.
[04:43.66]I thought this was going to come out in like November or December, right at the very end of 2012.
[04:49.16]And I was proven wrong.
[04:50.82]And that's pretty awesome because I can't wait to see it.
[04:53.76]So yeah, that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[04:55.64]Thank you all so much for watching.
[04:57.10]I really do appreciate it.
[04:58.42]And let's see how this update comes through.
[05:00.72]Let's see how awesome it is.
[05:01.96]Let's see how cool Meet the Pyro is.
[05:03.44]I'm sure we're all going to be talking about this tomorrow.
[05:06.00]There will be a video on this channel tomorrow as well, talking about all the items in detail, showing them in gameplay form.
[05:11.88]Just wanted to make this video telling you how excited I am, and I can't wait for Meet the Pyro, and I can't wait for these items!
[05:17.05]But yeah, anyways, I'll see you guys all next time, and take care, everybody.
