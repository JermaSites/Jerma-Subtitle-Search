[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.13]Hello there.
[00:04.52]How you doing on this fine Thursday evening?
[00:07.30]Is it Thursday?
[00:07.82]It's Friday.
[00:11.70]A little late today.
[00:12.56]Sorry.
[00:13.66]I've been so good too.
[00:15.18]I have been ever since I opened up this window with the three to four.
[00:19.15]I haven't been late in like six or seven weeks or something.
[00:23.09]It's been great.
[00:25.21]But we're working together with Etalyx today.
[00:29.70]So, we're kind of bouncing back and forth.
[00:31.14]Hey, can you hear me?
[00:32.00]I can't hear you.
[00:32.66]What are your audio levels like?
[00:35.52]So, we've been setting up.
[00:37.04]And we're going to play Risk of Rain 2.
[00:38.84]Co-op.
[00:44.37]Everyone's talking about this game.
[00:45.49]Apparently it's really good.
[00:47.65]I have not played it.
[00:49.59]But it looks very, very fun.
[00:54.00]Risk of Rain plus 2.
[00:57.46]It's very addictive.
[01:00.77]That's so... That's what I've heard.
[01:07.39]Did I play the original?
[01:09.29]I played... No.
[01:13.79]I enjoyed the original.
[01:16.19]Vicariously.
[01:22.28]Because I like... I think I've played it a few times.
[01:27.16]Randomly.
[01:29.42]I don't think I own it though, but I've seen people play it, and I've watched people play it, and it looked really fun, and I vicariously played the game through other people.
[01:38.83]Never really gave it too much attention, and I attribute that to the fact that this one is a third-person 3D perspective, and the other one is the 2D side-scrolling perspective, and I like this approach better.
[01:55.55]First game is apparently phenomenal, and it looked phenomenal.
[02:04.72]But no, I did not really play it.
[02:10.01]You know that the item effects stack and don't have a limit, right?
[02:12.29]I have no idea.
[02:15.09]Uh, Etalyx is gonna pretty much be here to be the guy that answers every single question.
[02:20.27]So if you have a question tonight, ask Etalyx, because he'll be able to answer it.
[02:25.00]So, for the purpose of the stream, if you have a Risk of Rain 2 question, please put in your chat message.
[02:31.00]Hey Etalyx Dash!
[02:33.25]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I will ask him.
[02:38.46]Because I don't fucking know anything.
[02:48.16]Now, questions that pertain to the video game, okay?
[02:53.00]I'm not going to relay... It has to be a gameplay-related question.
[02:56.84]And if it's not, then mods, clean them up.
[02:58.55]You know what I mean?
[02:59.97]Clean them up.
[03:02.30]If you don't, I'll clean him up.
[03:03.37]His Jerm of mob talk.
[03:06.41]Forget him out of here.
[03:10.95]But I think I'll see if he's ready.
[03:14.59]Hello?
[03:17.57]Are you here?
[03:19.28]Hello.
[03:19.88]Are you with me?
[03:20.34]I am indeed.
[03:21.34]Alrighty.
[03:22.82]Hold on.
[03:23.14]You seem a bit loud.
[03:26.20]Right click me in Discord.
[03:27.86]Turn me down.
[03:32.03]How about like right there?
[03:33.95]I'm not on webcam, Mike, right?
[03:37.43]I don't think so.
[03:38.27]Remember the whole time I was on webcam, Mike?
[03:40.73]No, I'm not.
[03:42.17]No, I don't think you are.
[03:45.35]However, do you want to check your dashboard and click the accept button?
[03:50.91]Accept button?
[03:51.69]Where is it?
[03:54.92]Oh, this is just squads, man!
[03:56.96]Yeah, you are super loud.
[03:58.26]Hold on.
[04:00.80]Dude, we're in like a Twitch squad right now.
[04:04.80]We just like squatted the fuck up.
[04:07.64]What does that even do?
[04:08.26]Alright, chat.
[04:15.55]What that does is there's a button at the top of the stream that is going to show our scores.
[04:23.95]Um, no.
[04:24.95]We're hiding that information.
[04:26.41]Oh.
[04:27.23]I don't want to embarrass you.
[04:29.27]Oh, you don't want to embarrass yourself?
[04:30.43]I mean, that could happen too.
[04:32.11]You can, like, click on the squad button up at the top.
[04:36.00]And then it shows both streams at the same time like multi Twitch.
[04:40.08]And you even stay in the same chat room you were already in.
[04:44.36]But you see both video feeds simultaneously and interchangeably click between them.
[04:50.81]Wait a minute, wait, you lost me here.
[04:52.13]Hold on, both streams at the same time?
[04:56.51]They call it squads because when you're playing Apex with your friends.
[05:01.11]You just said the Voldemort word.
[05:05.48]Now everyone's going to want us to play Apex.
[05:09.66]Yeah, well, we'll go ahead and stop you there.
[05:13.46]So this is Risk of Rain 2.
[05:15.84]All questions, by the way, please put hey Etalyx dash and then your question because I won't be able to answer it.
[05:21.35]And I will read it because I'm not in your stupid chat, chatters.
[05:26.11]It's a nice chat.
[05:27.15]That's kind of an unbelievable thing to open up with, but that's fine.
[05:31.77]Everyone's like, oh my god.
[05:33.31]Stop it!
[05:33.57]Alright, you ready?
[05:36.11]Let's try this out.
[05:40.94]So, this is a game about collecting items.
[05:45.02]It's a game about, I think, collecting bugs.
[05:48.00]Collecting bugs.
[05:51.44]We have to be the same character, right?
[05:53.88]We both have to be the same character.
[05:56.05]There are six classes available, but they have to be unlocked.
[06:01.28]Okay.
[06:02.04]So double tap, that's shoot twice for 2 times 90% damage.
[06:07.79]Which is 180% damage.
[06:11.33]Interesting.
[06:12.35]Okay, 180 damage.
[06:14.31]Phase round.
[06:15.43]Fire a piercing bullet that hits all enemies in line for 230% damage.
[06:19.81]Okay.
[06:21.48]Well, no, that would be 2, so that would be like 3.5 damage.
[06:25.36]How does it... Hey, Etalyx!
[06:28.30]Hey!
[06:28.94]How's that work?
[06:29.40]I've never played this game.
[06:30.94]Oh, right.
[06:32.36]I didn't even play the first game!
[06:36.92]Wait, hold on, you didn't play the first game either?
[06:38.74]No.
[06:40.98]So we're both just total scrub assholes then.
[06:45.60]I went through like a long, long tangent at the very beginning.
[06:49.82]Normally, I would be a good guide for a new game like this.
[06:54.51]Wow, this is not good.
[06:57.48]This is not good.
[06:58.02]But you know as much as I do.
[06:59.26]He's usually the guide.
[07:00.46]He's usually like the game guide.
[07:02.22]Everybody told me, like, why haven't you played Risk of Rain?
[07:06.40]And I said, because it's ugly, and it's 2D, and it's pixel art, and I hate those kind of games, as everybody knows.
[07:12.15]Right.
[07:12.51]So now that it's 3D with graphics, I thought, it's a perfect time to play.
[07:17.15]Well, you missed out, because it was... I watched a streamer beat it.
[07:20.81]I'm not gonna say names here, but the name was Star.
[07:25.83]They beat it on stream, and it was great.
[07:27.20]It was great content.
[07:31.72]So we're playing on the Rainstorm difficulty, which sounds very thematic.
[07:39.02]Okay, cool.
[07:42.25]Quote, the way the game was intended to be played.
[07:45.09]Okay, so those of you guys that have been paying attention at home, we've got a cross here.
[07:50.91]Sounds good.
[07:51.87]This is, what is it, $34?
[07:52.39]What does that mean?
[07:55.72]It means... Oh, I have 16 bucks.
[07:58.30]Remember when we linked our bank account?
[08:00.64]When we installed?
[08:01.78]Right, right, right, right.
[08:04.18]So it's just constantly cross-referencing and checking and... Basically, there's a direct line of credit to the loot boxes.
[08:11.93]Okay, so you get money.
[08:13.53]Do I have to collect the money or is it just happening?
[08:15.83]Okay, people are starting to come out here.
[08:16.91]Okay, that hurt.
[08:19.67]That's a dodge roll.
[08:21.37]And this is like a super shot.
[08:22.73]Okay.
[08:23.52]And that's a phaser.
[08:24.16]Okay.
[08:28.78]Yeah, you have your default shoot.
[08:31.36]One of them is like a stun.
[08:33.66]The one that does like a three-round burst.
[08:37.54]So does Dodge have iframes?
[08:39.56]That's all I care about.
[08:40.54]I think you just move so fast, it's physically impossible for anybody else to hit you.
[08:49.67]What'd I get?
[08:51.19]Personal shield generator.
[08:52.83]I got a recharging shield now.
[08:55.41]I think we should probably leave, right?
[08:57.21]Oh, you're like...
[09:00.43]I'm over here.
[09:01.17]There's stuff over here.
[09:03.03]I was just standing in the starter area.
[09:06.55]Oops.
[09:09.65]So I don't know what any item does.
[09:11.17]We're just going to pick stuff up at random.
[09:12.99]Shift is sprint.
[09:13.57]Alright.
[09:13.83]So is there like a... We should probably stay together.
[09:15.35]That's a great idea.
[09:19.25]I have a recharging shield.
[09:20.33]So there's boxes all over the ground.
[09:22.05]There's boxes all over the ground.
[09:23.83]And we're killing things and getting money.
[09:26.65]There's also boxes on the ground that have money.
[09:28.90]Are you up?
[09:30.54]I'll come to you.
[09:33.21]So this is the teleporter, right?
[09:35.77]Our goal is to find the teleporter, and whenever we want to, activate it.
[09:39.01]So we can stay here and grind for as long as we want.
[09:42.19]Really?
[09:42.49]The longer we stay, the meter at the top right that says easy gets progressively more difficult.
[09:49.66]Oh, interesting.
[09:50.46]Okay.
[09:53.82]We're basically trying to superpower ourselves, and then when we're done doing that, we move on to the next level.
[10:01.13]Yeah.
[10:01.49]So is it based on levels, or is it... Hey, Etalyx!
[10:04.73]Hey!
[10:05.31]Is it based on levels, or is it based on to just try to grind as hard as you can in one area?
[10:12.61]Both, I think?
[10:13.77]Okay.
[10:22.66]Alright, do you got... How much money do you got?
[10:24.40]I've been opening everything I see.
[10:28.10]I'm gonna come to you.
[10:34.08]I do like the dodge roll though.
[10:34.94]I have like a war banner.
[10:36.24]How did you even get up there?
[10:37.08]I think I used a jump pad.
[10:41.58]A jump pad?
[10:43.18]Oh, activate teleporter.
[10:44.42]Okay, don't touch that, right?
[10:46.84]Not unless we're absolutely ready.
[10:48.72]No, we're not, right?
[10:51.50]Are we ready?
[10:52.32]I don't think so.
[10:54.50]I don't know.
[10:54.98]How much money do you have?
[10:55.86]I have 72 bucks.
[10:57.06]I have 34 dollars.
[10:57.80]I just bought something.
[10:59.26]I just got gasoline.
[11:00.24]War banner.
[11:01.74]Drop a war banner on leveling up, giving you great strength.
[11:04.08]Okay.
[11:04.56]That's what I got.
[11:05.18]That's what that is.
[11:06.26]Oh, I see.
[11:07.46]So if you, like, fight inside of that, you get, like, bonus stats to everything.
[11:12.74]Interesting.
[11:15.54]Like, attack speed up.
[11:17.81]Maybe damage.
[11:18.47]We should just hang out up here, then.
[11:20.61]Just grind money.
[11:22.39]Who cares?
[11:22.97]Well, if we run around the map, we can find more boxes to... Oh, wait.
[11:26.75]Boxes, yeah.
[11:29.41]...purchase upgrades.
[11:30.93]Cool.
[11:31.03]Cool.
[11:33.09]Jerma thinks he's good at the game.
[11:36.67]I'm like asking questions.
[11:39.11]I'm asking like, oh, so, okay, so we do this.
[11:41.04]What about this?
[11:42.00]What do we do about this?
[11:43.30]I think she's fucking good at the game.
[11:44.60]I'm like asking questions.
[11:53.55]What'd you just do?
[11:57.21]This is an E3 presentation.
[12:00.19]So what about over here?
[12:08.16]Hey, Talisman, watch out for those skulls.
[12:09.46]They're dangerous.
[12:11.08]You literally cut off.
[12:12.64]Hey, watch out for the... Dying main character fails to communicate most important line of dialog to new supporting cast and hero in the main character role.
[12:24.64]Easy.
[12:24.90]Did I die?
[12:29.85]Oh, no.
[12:30.13]I thought I just got killed.
[12:31.07]Alright, here's a box.
[12:31.89]Open it.
[12:33.21]I do like this money system.
[12:35.27]Fire a swarm of missiles.
[12:36.79]I like getting paid all the time, too.
[12:38.17]Okay, I think we may have just spawned everything.
[12:40.17]Look it over here.
[12:42.53]One Lunar.
[12:44.51]Okay.
[12:45.85]I said we spawned everything.
[12:46.97]Did you do like some kind of mountain?
[12:48.77]No.
[12:49.85]Like cursed item?
[12:50.75]What is this?
[12:51.43]I don't know.
[12:51.93]I don't think so.
[12:52.75]I just picked an item up.
[12:56.78]You definitely did this.
[12:58.02]I didn't.
[12:58.54]I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
[13:00.72]It was a trap up here.
[13:02.78]I opened up an orange case and got a new item.
[13:11.67]Can we stack these war banners?
[13:14.53]Somebody said apparently everything is stackable in the whole game.
[13:17.35]Really?
[13:18.15]I think so.
[13:18.95]So the whole point is just becoming more overpowered.
[13:21.91]I guess, yeah.
[13:23.07]People were saying activate the teleporter.
[13:27.16]Should we do that or should we wait until medium?
[13:31.02]I don't know.
[13:31.30]I guess we can just do it now and see what happens.
[13:32.72]I mean, we're pretty close to medium.
[13:35.28]I think we can handle it.
[13:38.71]Noticing more elites popping up.
[13:40.75]Is that what the flame on the head means?
[13:44.27]I think the flame on the head, I have like an ability that sets it on fire.
[13:48.49]Deleting elite monster items.
[13:50.76]3D printer.
[13:53.56]Oh, I think I can just deal extra damage to bosses.
[13:57.68]Cool.
[13:58.54]So are there headshots in this game?
[14:02.01]Now, obviously, these enemies are only head.
[14:04.29]Yeah, I don't... It doesn't feel like there is.
[14:06.09]There might be.
[14:06.51]There might be.
[14:08.24]But I don't think there is.
[14:09.04]Alright, teleporter.
[14:11.78]Are we gonna just activate it?
[14:12.60]Might as well just see what it does.
[14:14.94]Hey, there is fall damage.
[14:17.24]How bad is it on a scale of 1 to 10?
[14:19.86]Um... 2?
[14:20.56]Okay, let's say I was, like... 1 is I jump off of a ledge, and 10 is I jump off of, like, a building.
[14:28.33]Um...
[14:31.34]Can you go over that, like, scale again?
[14:35.20]How bad is it?
[14:36.16]The joke is that is... The joke is... The joke is that is the scale.
[14:42.07]So, like, it would be, like, four.
[14:46.57]And it was fucking hilarious.
[14:49.27]You should see my chat right now.
[14:51.19]No, most time when, like, somebody says something fucking dumb or weird, you see, like, a bunch of question marks.
[14:54.51]I don't know about what's going on in your stream, but... That's, like, a ton of laughs.
[14:59.84]Alright, so that's the boss.
[15:00.62]Stone Titan.
[15:01.36]I don't think the question marks are laughs.
[15:03.22]Chris Vanguard.
[15:06.99]Ah, he's killing me.
[15:09.37]Just don't die.
[15:12.05]Okay, I'll deal with the adds.
[15:15.69]Don't say that.
[15:17.00]What?
[15:19.48]What would you classify these as?
[15:21.24]Are we running adds right now?
[15:23.97]No, don't say that word.
[15:25.03]Do not say the word add.
[15:26.01]You already said it.
[15:27.43]No, but you said it in the context of the advertisement.
[15:30.19]Are you dead?
[15:31.09]Can I get you?
[15:31.49]I'm dead.
[15:35.49]How do I revive you?
[15:37.54]We should have done it earlier.
[15:38.62]We should have activated the easy mode earlier.
[15:44.30]Easy mode.
[15:44.94]I got fragged.
[15:45.74]Enter the teleporter.
[15:47.10]Hold on.
[15:48.00]But is there a way I can get you back?
[15:50.54]Or are you actually just dead?
[15:52.00]I think I'm actually just dead.
[15:55.04]Interesting, okay.
[15:56.94]I come back at the end of the level, so good luck.
[15:59.86]There's no way I'm gonna beat this.
[16:02.38]I can 100% guarantee that this is not going to be completed.
[16:05.20]Just line them all up and get a collateral.
[16:08.32]I mean, I'm trying to.
[16:09.06]Well, that was a good try.
[16:11.40]You did go narrowly right through every other enemy.
[16:15.13]Hey, it's hard when you got fucking a hundred people fighting you.
[16:17.65]What are your, like, fireworks?
[16:19.81]It's my special move.
[16:29.23]There's too many of these heads.
[16:32.89]This is not even the boss.
[16:35.56]Is this why when I looked over, everyone was saying, Teleporter!
[16:37.84]Teleporter!
[16:38.40]Teleporter!
[16:38.94]Teleporter!
[16:40.90]I have minus one health.
[16:41.88]Oh, that means I'm dead.
[16:44.46]Good, now I don't feel so bad.
[16:46.64]We can die together in eternal bliss.
[16:49.13]Medium on the first level.
[16:52.17]That apparently was not a good idea.
[16:59.30]So can we just keep going?
[17:01.38]Yeah, I think we just try to get good.
[17:04.08]Alright, let's go.
[17:06.48]Let's do it.
[17:06.90]Let's get good.
[17:07.44]I don't know if you know, I just beat Sekiro on stream like last week.
[17:11.82]I don't know if you know that, but I mean, obviously you know that.
[17:14.52]How many times did you die?
[17:15.49]Because that's how many times we have to die here before we can beat this game.
[17:18.53]I act like we didn't talk about it downstairs.
[17:24.41]Yeah, I was just wanting you to repeat it for everyone else to hear.
[17:26.45]Alright, are you out of your egg?
[17:28.85]No.
[17:29.96]Come on, we gotta go.
[17:30.88]It's time.
[17:31.70]Okay.
[17:34.64]You can't just sit in there.
[17:35.86]I'm going.
[17:36.86]Alright, we gotta find the teleporter and win, go quick.
[17:39.09]That hurts, by the way.
[17:39.73]I don't think we're supposed to find the teleporter first.
[17:42.11]There's actual team damage.
[17:44.87]You know what, I'm just gonna blame the RNG, okay?
[17:47.45]The drops were terrible.
[17:50.05]No, blame the fact that we didn't, we were supposed to just activate the teleporter, keep going.
[17:55.97]This is a game about speed.
[17:59.88]We have to split up a little bit because we have to find the teleporter.
[18:02.40]Yeah, we do have to find the teleporter.
[18:03.82]You're right.
[18:04.10]There we go.
[18:15.45]I'm just trying to get some money.
[18:16.23]Imagine this game on insane difficulty.
[18:19.17]See, that's what the problem is.
[18:19.97]I didn't have a shield like you did.
[18:21.19]That's why I died so fast.
[18:23.67]Can you imagine this game on insane?
[18:26.15]That definitely isn't insane difficult.
[18:27.63]It has to be.
[18:29.21]There is one higher than this.
[18:31.57]This game is a race against the difficulty, is what Twitch user, I don't, what was her name?
[18:40.62]This game is a race, I don't know.
[18:42.69]Wow, please cite your sources, thank you.
[18:44.47]Yeah, that was, that was.
[18:48.73]Doing your homework on Wikipedia right now.
[18:49.99]Taco, what was her name?
[18:52.37]Taco Tangler.
[18:54.89]There's no enemies in this game, where are they?
[18:56.57]If you have a question, ask TacoTank.
[18:59.01]I want everyone to preface their questions with, Hey TacoTank!
[19:10.56]Yeah, we're using MLA or Chicago style here?
[19:13.52]Chicago style?
[19:14.38]Is this a hot dog?
[19:17.56]What did you just say?
[19:18.76]Foreign fruit.
[19:19.60]Heal on use.
[19:20.66]Interesting.
[19:22.39]Told you to cite your sources.
[19:23.37]I didn't know which one you were using.
[19:25.09]We're doing hot dog style.
[19:26.51]Oh.
[19:29.17]Alright, let's go.
[19:30.84]No more, like, funny jokes.
[19:32.08]The teleporter's right here.
[19:32.86]Alright, let's activate it.
[19:33.40]We can't activate it right now.
[19:34.44]Why not?
[19:35.76]Can we?
[19:36.54]Yeah, get it.
[19:37.32]We're so weak.
[19:38.42]But, let's go.
[19:39.72]Alright.
[19:41.35]You asked for it.
[19:42.01]See, now we kill it.
[19:43.13]We're not gonna get overwhelmed.
[19:44.51]Kill it, quick!
[19:50.55]Headshots only.
[19:51.13]Giant ant.
[19:52.03]Told you we were collecting bugs.
[19:59.41]What is this thing?
[20:01.20]Speaking of bugs, I have like a bug that's healing me or something.
[20:04.12]Hold on, I'm gonna go stand over here with your heal bug.
[20:06.06]Oh my god, that hurt.
[20:07.58]Is this a heal bug?
[20:09.62]Oh god.
[20:11.82]I just used my heal and nothing happened.
[20:13.93]I think I'm gonna heal right now.
[20:15.77]How am I dead again?
[20:16.59]Oh, you dead?
[20:17.03]Alright, let me see if I can do this.
[20:18.77]Told you we should have done this.
[20:20.54]But look, he's at like 40% HP.
[20:21.82]My heal did not do anything.
[20:29.96]Oh my god.
[20:32.20]We're not ready.
[20:33.83]We gotta have more power-ups before we activate this.
[20:37.43]All I have is a personal shield.
[20:40.01]We might actually... I just killed my healer.
[20:42.87]Personal goals for today.
[20:44.03]Beat level 1.
[20:44.81]Personal goal.
[20:45.65]Complete level 1.
[20:47.99]I'll get it.
[20:52.40]It's harder than Monster Hunter.
[20:57.38]Come on, give me that heal.
[21:03.39]Give me that heal.
[21:09.93]How funny would it be if it was the exact same problem as Monster Hunter?
[21:14.03]This is like four player difficulty.
[21:15.84]I'm dead.
[21:19.78]The bug doesn't heal.
[21:22.63]The bug doesn't heal.
[21:23.45]Well, I had an actual heal in my pocket that didn't heal.
[21:26.41]Hey, Taco Tangler!
[21:28.65]Uh... What are we doing wrong here?
[21:31.27]Are we on the wrong difficulty?
[21:32.77]I think we just... I think we need some more power-ups.
[21:35.19]We gotta split up, get money.
[21:37.57]Let's say, like, open at least five boxes each.
[21:41.41]Alright, five boxes each.
[21:43.11]Minimum.
[21:46.09]Just get more items.
[21:47.11]But don't let it go all the way into, like, medium territory.
[21:49.69]Okay.
[21:50.33]Yeah.
[21:50.83]Five boxes is too much.
[21:51.97]Be fast.
[21:52.78]What does Taco Tangler say?
[21:54.46]He's the expert.
[21:59.20]Grab a few chests and level a little bit before activating the teleporter.
[22:02.28]And once the event is over, you can get the remaining items.
[22:04.14]Alright, that sounds good.
[22:06.06]Thanks, Taco Tangler.
[22:08.04]That wasn't even Taco Tangler.
[22:09.98]Somebody else.
[22:13.54]Wait, Taco Tangler left.
[22:17.67]Taco Tangler didn't get enough credit.
[22:19.02]Alright, we gotta hurry.
[22:20.22]No, they're still here.
[22:20.92]Alright, let's go.
[22:24.54]I'm going this way.
[22:25.72]I'm gonna bang a right.
[22:30.62]The little boxes that don't cost anything have money in them.
[22:33.28]Yeah.
[22:35.25]So it's a race against the difficulty.
[22:37.11]You gotta get a couple items, couple levels.
[22:46.74]So are crits random?
[22:48.84]I think there's something that can influence it.
[22:50.96]34 bucks?
[22:51.50]Shit, I don't have enough.
[22:53.76]55.
[22:54.08]Alright, 34.
[23:00.85]Let's go.
[23:01.13]I went to a dead end.
[23:02.05]Okay, that is... I got an extra jump.
[23:10.28]Okay, that's pretty useful.
[23:17.01]Small natural crit chance.
[23:19.23]23 bucks, don't got enough.
[23:20.09]What is that?
[23:20.91]I almost just jumped off the ledge.
[23:22.77]I'm so glad you didn't.
[23:26.31]Okay, teleporter's by me.
[23:27.98]Chat's a natural hazard.
[23:29.68]Oh yeah, there's a lot of items over here too.
[23:31.34]Teleporter right next to me.
[23:32.36]Okay, I haven't even got one box yet.
[23:36.08]Offer to shrine of chance, $23.
[23:38.18]Okay, you offer to shrine but gain nothing.
[23:42.49]Thanks.
[23:43.78]Middle click is a ping.
[23:44.90]Oh shit.
[23:45.36]Okay, well that's not what the teleporter is, but that's a ping that you can see.
[23:48.26]You gain nothing.
[23:49.10]Wow.
[23:50.24]Twice in a row.
[23:51.08]Shrine of Chance.
[23:52.82]Las Vegas, baby.
[23:55.32]Dude, RNG in this game is a little, like, wonky.
[24:08.73]Oh my god.
[24:10.05]Why the fuck am I getting swarmed in here?
[24:12.61]Holy shit.
[24:13.21]Remember when I said five boxes?
[24:15.53]I'll settle for one.
[24:25.70]Jesus, there's like a few boxes over by me.
[24:27.72]I almost got enough money to do it.
[24:32.26]Somebody has like a sniper rifle over here.
[24:33.84]Ooh, let's go back to this robot.
[24:44.20]Alright, I got a lot of money now.
[24:45.08]Let's go.
[24:46.80]They have to make these boxes $69 on purpose.
[24:49.20]Like, that's not... That's just part of the development cycle.
[24:51.24]Alright, I'm going to have, like, three or four boxes by the time this is done here.
[24:55.20]So this is... Dealing damage heals you.
[24:58.30]That's pretty amazing.
[24:59.38]Okay.
[24:59.84]Oh, God.
[25:01.24]How much does it heal?
[25:01.88]I can't really tell.
[25:06.43]I'm kind of heading towards you.
[25:07.39]I've only got one box so far.
[25:09.25]I got two.
[25:09.69]Alright, then.
[25:17.33]Did you actually just hit me out of the air?
[25:19.19]This leech is incredible.
[25:21.27]Every time I get hit, it just heals back up.
[25:25.33]How much money you got?
[25:27.31]50 bucks.
[25:28.19]What's the purple dollar sign for?
[25:29.71]I'm not sure.
[25:32.59]Game temporary flight.
[25:35.35]Okay.
[25:36.65]Missile launcher.
[25:37.74]Swarm of missiles.
[25:46.69]Alright, I got three items now.
[25:49.69]Four items.
[25:53.52]Sticky Bomb.
[25:54.12]Chance on hit.
[25:54.60]Alright.
[25:54.98]I got five items.
[25:58.84]I got like the War Banner thing.
[26:00.22]Alright, I now have two items.
[26:07.18]Deal extra damage to bosses.
[26:09.20]I like that one.
[26:19.69]Okay.
[26:21.45]I... You almost ready to go here?
[26:23.09]69!
[26:23.11]What is this one?
[26:30.87]I gotta... What the fuck?
[26:32.93]I can jump three times?
[26:35.25]Okay.
[26:36.29]Everything stacks.
[26:37.49]Assuming we win... You get to keep that for the next... That's amazing.
[26:43.21]The next life, and you just keep getting more powerful.
[26:46.97]Is there like a soft way to land?
[26:49.36]I guess I have temporary flight, so I'll just activate that on the way down, right?
[26:53.24]Probably, yeah.
[26:54.18]Okay, I'm just going to get another item.
[26:55.86]What does this thing do?
[27:00.10]Well, that was sick.
[27:02.08]Teleport.
[27:02.72]People are screaming at us to do teleporter.
[27:05.56]They're saying we're going to run out of our opportunity here.
[27:07.66]Okay.
[27:09.40]Are there any more leftover boxes down here?
[27:12.72]There's one over here, I think.
[27:15.30]Did you activate it?
[27:17.92]The teleporter?
[27:18.82]No.
[27:19.46]Oh, God.
[27:19.84]Because I still have $70.
[27:21.44]I just need... I can't spend my money.
[27:23.48]Alright, well, you can save it.
[27:25.25]Alright, let's go.
[27:26.39]I guess you can.
[27:27.31]Yeah.
[27:28.29]Turn on the shrine.
[27:28.85]What is that?
[27:32.63]Oh, boy.
[27:34.05]Monster tooth.
[27:34.69]Drop a healing orb on kill.
[27:37.27]You can do it again.
[27:38.81]What did that just do?
[27:43.18]Are we going to activate it?
[27:44.48]Yeah, let's go.
[27:45.04]Oh, God.
[27:46.06]Oh, God.
[27:47.67]I'm not ready.
[27:48.55]Just kill this last robot and then spawn him.
[27:50.32]Yeah, we gotta do it, man.
[27:52.16]We gotta go.
[27:55.72]Oh.
[27:59.88]Is that the boss up there?
[28:00.76]Yeah, it is.
[28:01.80]Yeah, those are the bosses, alright.
[28:02.98]I'm gonna get some distance.
[28:11.87]Whichever, that's like a big explosion, I think.
[28:20.02]Oh my god, there's so many.
[28:29.65]We gotta focus on one of them.
[28:30.71]Focus on the one with less health.
[28:31.61]I know!
[28:32.03]We're just running away.
[28:32.85]We're like running into the corner.
[28:36.16]We're so dead.
[28:37.08]We're gonna die again.
[28:38.16]You understand that, right?
[28:39.04]Hold on.
[28:40.08]Take the weak one.
[28:40.58]There's a weak one.
[28:41.42]We are like fundamentally doing something wrong.
[28:50.42]One of them is dead.
[28:52.18]One of them's dead, good.
[28:53.38]So am I. Oh, you're dead.
[28:57.86]We are fundamentally doing something incorrect.
[28:59.82]Because he's not even at 50% health.
[29:16.75]Get all items first.
[29:17.91]Well, doesn't that make the boss harder?
[29:23.65]How far can I run?
[29:30.57]Wait, I can share items with you?
[29:31.77]How?
[29:39.72]How far away can I go?
[29:40.72]Okay, not doing anything wrong.
[29:41.98]It's just a really hard game.
[29:43.50]Okay, I see.
[29:53.36]I'm gonna fall off the ledge.
[29:59.84]This game sucks.
[30:00.68]This game sucks!
[30:02.64]No, this character.
[30:04.33]Alright, Taco, you've had enough.
[30:05.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[30:08.43]Somebody said, this character sucks early and is more geared towards late game.
[30:13.37]But it's the first character, though.
[30:14.83]That's not what I was trying to say.
[30:20.90]Stop sniping me.
[30:23.10]This game sucks.
[30:25.56]That's not what I was trying to say.
[30:27.08]I'll turn the game up a little.
[30:49.28]Unlucky boss.
[30:50.94]Unfortunate.
[30:51.46]Wait, is this boss just, like, ridiculous?
[30:53.68]Just, like, a weird, hard, RNG role of a boss?
[30:59.68]Why is the teleporter only at 57%?
[31:01.04]Yeah.
[31:02.96]People are saying that this boss, we kind of got, like, a bad role for, like, early new players, because he's just, like, annoying and hard to deal with.
[31:13.25]You might still do it.
[31:14.19]Oh, God, look at that, like, caravan of people behind you.
[31:16.87]Yes, I see all of them.
[31:17.99]There's so many.
[31:19.63]Oh, they're behind me now, too.
[31:21.67]And, by the way, we have to stay inside the bubble around the teleporter to charge it.
[31:26.69]Oh, God.
[31:27.05]Oh, God.
[31:29.07]We need to stay in the teleporter's sphere.
[31:35.61]So, do you have to kill the boss?
[31:37.91]Yeah, I think so.
[31:38.29]Or can you just leave?
[31:40.15]What is this ice demon?
[31:50.48]No, you almost got it.
[31:55.38]At 99% charge, monsters stop spawning.
[31:59.02]Oh, that's a huge deal.
[32:01.14]That is a huge deal.
[32:02.18]That's good to know.
[32:10.07]Wait, is that not true?
[32:11.57]Is somebody just lying?
[32:13.41]Somebody just lying?
[32:14.45]Okay, I'm definitely dead here.
[32:18.09]Is that a lie?
[32:19.50]No, it's true.
[32:20.28]It is true.
[32:21.04]Okay.
[32:24.40]Monsters will stop spawning at 99%.
[32:25.90]You're on medium difficulty now.
[32:34.91]Help me!
[32:38.10]This game's crazy.
[32:50.39]I'm dead.
[32:51.77]I was so close.
[32:53.45]Some people are asking why we're not playing with Scar.
[32:55.87]Because we're dying on the first level and he has like... We're dying on level one!
[32:58.92]And he has like a hundred hours in the game.
[33:01.26]So you think he's gonna want to play with two chumps that are starting out in like the noob level?
[33:06.86]We're dying on level one.
[33:11.29]He has like a hundred and fifty hours in the game right now.
[33:17.59]Push continue.
[33:18.31]There we go.
[33:18.55]Maybe when we get a little better, maybe he can jump in.
[33:28.16]Let us get through like the first level first.
[33:34.75]I guess this is... We got it this time.
[33:37.67]This time, charge inside.
[33:47.59]So we're on like the regular difficulty.
[33:49.76]Learn on Drizzle.
[33:51.10]Drizzle is too easy.
[33:56.18]Play Drizzle until you get used to the game.
[33:59.64]Says weeping and gnashing is replaced by laughter and tickles.
[34:09.21]Drizzle is baby mode.
[34:12.11]Let's stream on that mode.
[34:13.83]I think if you stream on that mode, people laugh at you.
[34:17.44]Yeah, I think something goes bad.
[34:18.84]But it's okay.
[34:20.30]Let's do a few more attempts on Rainstorm.
[34:22.53]I'm alright with doing the Drizzlewood.
[34:27.57]I think we can do it.
[34:28.41]I think we were pretty close.
[34:29.80]We just have to lock it in.
[34:31.96]Yeah, let's lock it in.
[34:32.58]Let's go.
[34:39.83]We'll be laughing at you no matter what.
[34:42.65]I think we're starting to understand the basic elements of the game.
[34:47.95]Starting to figure it out.
[34:52.48]Yeah, I feel like I actually did a lot better last time.
[34:55.18]Yeah, charge... Charge the pod.
[35:01.05]That whole enemy's not spawning after 99% is actually a big deal.
[35:08.24]This way.
[35:08.65]Try to get some money.
[35:10.41]Alright, I got 34.
[35:18.02]Why would we spawn up here?
[35:20.98]RNG, man.
[35:24.80]We won't laugh at you guys for playing Drizzle.
[35:26.68]We'll laugh at you when you die at the first level on Drizzle.
[35:32.18]That's fair, okay?
[35:33.22]That's actually pretty fair.
[35:34.00]That does put, yeah.
[35:35.00]No, that's the decent terms.
[35:37.30]I could agree to those terms.
[35:39.53]I'm afraid to agree to those terms, though, because I feel like when you agree to those terms, if something goes wrong and you lose, all your credibility is gone forever.
[35:48.02]But then you have to just play again, but on the hardest difficulty, and then win.
[35:51.88]That's the only way you could get your credit back, I think.
[35:53.82]Alright, there's nothing over here.
[35:59.15]Your gamer licenses have been revoked.
[36:03.69]Take it like this.
[36:04.35]If Sekiro had a drizzle mode, would you play on it?
[36:06.33]No.
[36:07.09]Uh-oh.
[36:07.63]Not this conversation.
[36:09.45]We already talked about this last night.
[36:11.55]Oh, we already wrapped around.
[36:14.38]Hang on.
[36:15.16]Where are we supposed to go?
[36:18.40]Uh, I came down.
[36:19.30]Okay, well, we both have money.
[36:24.97]Have you gone down here already?
[36:26.45]Yeah, but not all the way down.
[36:28.23]But I just got exploded, though.
[36:37.32]Sekiro with guns, baby.
[36:40.78]Lost on the first level.
[36:41.98]Come on, give us a break.
[36:43.54]We're trying.
[36:44.04]We're trying to figure it out.
[36:45.12]We're brand new Risk of Rain 2 players.
[36:48.23]Yeah.
[36:49.13]Don't push us away, Risk of Rain 1 veterans, okay?
[36:52.73]You want people to play your, like, fun franchise?
[36:56.27]This is how you do it.
[36:58.27]I got the Bandolier.
[36:59.37]Chance on kill to drop an ammo pack that resets cooldowns.
[37:01.73]That's pretty awesome.
[37:05.95]What's this one?
[37:06.45]Your offer to the shrine is rewarded.
[37:09.42]I get 100% crits for 8 seconds.
[37:11.94]That's actually great.
[37:14.44]What is that?
[37:15.26]I found the teleporter.
[37:16.04]I got a friend.
[37:16.48]I have, like, a turret friend.
[37:17.44]We have, like, a new party member.
[37:19.38]Oh, it's Star!
[37:20.78]Star just joined the game.
[37:21.48]He's, like, a turret!
[37:22.74]He's a Mini-Sentry!
[37:27.29]Does he move?
[37:27.93]I don't think so.
[37:32.37]There's a turret.
[37:32.89]Yeah, that turret's pretty awesome, though.
[37:34.51]We could, like, lead... Because the teleporter's right here, so... He's gonna help.
[37:40.05]Yeah, just lead every enemy to that thing.
[37:42.01]Alright, we gotta keep moving.
[37:44.75]Does it have a health bar?
[37:45.93]That thing is amazing.
[37:48.17]Can it die?
[37:48.91]I assume it can get exploded.
[37:49.93]I mean, it has a health bar.
[37:52.08]What's this one?
[37:52.54]This one's smoking.
[37:53.52]60-something?
[37:57.06]Is this the same level we were just on, but everything's different?
[38:00.36]Or is the level actually randomly generated?
[38:02.34]Spawned on here.
[38:03.74]Taco.
[38:04.06]Oh, my turret.
[38:07.56]I need help, Taco.
[38:10.53]Yes.
[38:10.89]Yes.
[38:11.45]Yes doesn't help.
[38:12.11]I asked two questions.
[38:13.77]I got a healing drone.
[38:15.11]I have a lot of like robots with me.
[38:17.13]Alright.
[38:17.49]Come down here.
[38:17.97]I feel like this is the spot to be.
[38:21.02]Oh no.
[38:21.38]I have to choose which one I want.
[38:25.70]Yes.
[38:26.16]No.
[38:26.70]It's slightly different.
[38:27.56]Okay.
[38:32.62]Alright.
[38:33.58]What about that?
[38:34.02]How much money do I have?
[38:35.12]55?
[38:35.32]Do I need 60 to open this?
[38:39.54]drones are a huge deal the generic layout is the same with some doors and bridges that have changed okay each level has two to three variations mostly static items are random and I assume also the layout oh my god are you kidding me got two turrets alright I got so much money I don't know what to do with it I guess I'll spend it at this shrine I'm gonna win I think we're gonna win this level just because the turrets
[39:13.84]crowbar dude these guys are gonna be the first level are you kidding me I was here world first alright give me this thing so you have a heel drone too yeah you have two like drones on the ground and a heel drone that's pretty sick and his music is door electric what nothing what does a ukulele do
[39:41.43]Are we ready to pop it?
[39:42.87]Pop it.
[39:43.91]We're gonna stay in here, though.
[39:46.41]I don't see any more chests.
[39:49.04]But I have, like, $200.
[39:49.50]That's the best item.
[39:51.24]I don't know what it does.
[39:52.30]What does it do?
[39:54.96]Taco Tuesday!
[39:55.74]What does it do?
[39:57.58]Probably, like, plays music.
[39:59.94]Alright, you ready?
[40:00.40]I'm going.
[40:02.09]Here we go.
[40:02.49]Alright, we got... Just gotta stay inside the red.
[40:05.69]Stay inside the red.
[40:11.55]Where are they?
[40:12.43]Oh, it's that guy.
[40:13.03]It's the big... Where is it?
[40:14.85]It's the big guy.
[40:17.45]He's a big jellyfish.
[40:24.52]Alright, get in the red.
[40:25.76]He shoots like a slow-moving zappy orb.
[40:28.14]Oh my god, he does.
[40:28.96]And then a bunch of fast ones.
[40:32.96]I'm going for max crit.
[40:38.52]I think you can stop those.
[40:40.14]Just be careful when they get to their destination.
[40:43.52]Alright, I did a ton of damage.
[40:44.92]Eight seconds of crits was pretty sick.
[40:46.60]That was awesome.
[40:48.74]We're doing it.
[40:50.30]Watch out for that orb.
[40:53.68]I don't know what this is.
[40:54.58]Just run.
[40:55.02]What does that mean?
[40:55.56]I don't know.
[40:56.02]I don't know, but it did a lot of damage.
[41:00.10]Yo, E3 pretend gameplay!
[41:02.88]Watch out, man.
[41:07.74]Nice work.
[41:08.08]He's dead.
[41:09.81]They did it.
[41:10.17]They beat the first level.
[41:10.85]Now we just have to charge the teleporter.
[41:13.15]That was way easier than the other guy.
[41:15.15]It really was.
[41:15.63]What's this?
[41:20.03]Chance to fire a missile.
[41:21.85]Chance to fire a missile.
[41:22.95]Oh, he drops a bunch of shit and I just took it all.
[41:25.14]I'm a greedy fuck.
[41:27.64]Oh.
[41:29.68]I see how it is.
[41:31.26]The drone guy.
[41:33.46]I saw items and I pick them up.
[41:35.61]Someone's screaming in chat.
[41:37.47]Someone took both boss items.
[41:39.45]Yeah, I did.
[41:40.20]I'm gonna be like... Well, I didn't know that that was how the game... I didn't know what it did!
[41:45.90]I just saw an item on the ground.
[41:48.80]This game's old school.
[41:49.98]You have to like... You have to really test your friendships, okay?
[41:52.78]Everyone's saying shame on you.
[41:55.16]Not personal loot.
[41:56.23]Yeah.
[41:57.07]Okay guys, it's called... This isn't Diablo 3.
[41:58.47]It's called fucking snooze you'll lose.
[42:04.46]How do you kick someone from a lobby?
[42:09.25]TACO, how do you kick someone from a lobby?
[42:13.01]Oh, open all the boxes.
[42:18.69]I think after the boss dies, we can go around and pick up all the... We're on medium difficulty now.
[42:26.68]We are on medium now, yes.
[42:28.44]Permanently, I guess.
[42:31.34]It's because we're not going fast enough.
[42:35.03]They should have just... Risk of Rain.
[42:36.71]Like, rain's not that fast.
[42:39.47]I feel like it should have been called Risk of Rain, you know, to indicate the speed.
[42:42.41]Oh, never mind.
[42:44.59]What's hitting me?
[42:45.31]Oh.
[42:47.39]All your money gets converted to experience after you... Okay.
[42:51.51]All your money turns into experience when you go into Teleporter.
[42:54.87]So you gotta spend it.
[42:56.43]Don't hoard your cash.
[42:57.43]Spend it.
[42:57.95]Or maybe if you need to level up.
[42:59.61]Oh, so all my money's gone from the last one.
[43:01.67]Every cent you have is gone.
[43:02.59]It's experience now.
[43:05.54]Wait, it turns into XP?
[43:06.68]Turns into experience.
[43:09.16]Turns into experience?
[43:10.48]It turns into experience.
[43:18.15]Why is the ammo on the ground even doing?
[43:20.63]Alright, 82.
[43:21.23]Let's go.
[43:23.29]Why is he jumping so much?
[43:26.67]3D glasses.
[43:27.97]Chance to critically strike.
[43:29.93]Oh, it wasn't charged.
[43:32.63]What the hell is this thing?
[43:35.73]Heal all nearby allies after standing still for two seconds.
[43:39.83]Turn around.
[43:40.82]I'm a healer now.
[43:42.78]What is this thing?
[43:43.26]72, I don't have enough.
[43:55.21]Come at me.
[43:56.45]This is gonna be easy.
[43:59.63]What is this thing?
[44:00.68]Ooh, a little lance.
[44:02.32]Chance to bleed.
[44:03.06]So everything's way more expensive now, but are enemies worth more money?
[44:06.90]Looks like it, yeah.
[44:07.80]I assume so.
[44:12.11]Pick one.
[44:14.89]Yeah, I picked it.
[44:17.01]How you doing?
[44:17.81]You get nothing.
[44:18.81]How am I doing?
[44:19.59]Yeah.
[44:20.51]Pretty good.
[44:21.69]I got a crowbar times two.
[44:24.45]I also can heal you, apparently.
[44:26.27]Lunar.
[44:26.77]What is lunar?
[44:27.11]Lunar.
[44:29.66]I think it's like a special type of currency.
[44:31.38]Okay, so it's like a special kind of currency thing?
[44:35.94]Is that what you're saying?
[44:47.27]Okay.
[44:47.49]This game is serious.
[44:49.61]That's what I've heard.
[44:51.65]That's fine.
[44:53.59]I plan on taking it seriously.
[44:56.57]There's a box up here.
[44:57.65]I see where you are.
[44:59.68]What's that?
[44:59.96]Look at that.
[45:00.24]What's down there?
[45:02.92]What are you talking about?
[45:04.10]There's a ton of boxes down the swamp.
[45:07.90]I have no idea.
[45:08.42]Are we just throwing boxes at me?
[45:12.54]What the hell is it?
[45:13.08]Oh, no.
[45:13.34]It's you.
[45:18.55]I want my lucky item.
[45:20.49]I get it.
[45:21.07]That's cool.
[45:25.81]Lunars stick between runs and are quite useful.
[45:30.25]I'm trying to... Mark stuff with middle mouse.
[45:35.05]If you see something... Oh!
[45:39.33]That's cool.
[45:43.85]Yeah, the only reason why somebody told me that is because I looked over and I saw... Oh my god, Jeremy, like 30 times.
[45:53.19]Personal shield.
[45:55.43]Ha ha.
[45:57.27]Did you get this?
[45:57.71]So 3D printer.
[45:58.79]I marked you.
[46:00.80]So does the 3D printer, can I just put something in there?
[46:03.02]How do I choose what item goes in?
[46:04.02]Or does it just show up there?
[46:05.20]Whatever it is.
[46:05.64]I have no idea.
[46:07.48]Oh, that hurt.
[46:11.80]Alright, I got a lot of bleed power now.
[46:14.78]Have we found the teleporter?
[46:15.76]I don't think we have.
[46:16.62]There's a lot of boxes though.
[46:22.27]I have no idea where it is.
[46:27.87]We probably should think about doing it, though, because we're about to move into Hard.
[46:30.11]Yeah, it's probably not a good idea.
[46:32.91]We're going to move into Hard difficult.
[46:35.03]It's just hidden somewhere.
[46:37.86]I don't know where you've been.
[46:38.76]I guess I do, because all these boxes are open.
[46:41.18]It chooses an item that's the same color to exchange it.
[46:45.84]The Teleporter has orange particles.
[46:49.62]If you have 116 boxes, a Healbot right here.
[46:52.90]I got it.
[46:55.10]Get two Healbots.
[46:58.27]Alright, we gotta find this teleporter.
[46:59.65]We're gonna move into hard and then we're gonna get laughed at.
[47:04.65]What's this?
[47:06.89]I need one of these.
[47:07.61]The orange one I think is active items.
[47:09.10]It is.
[47:09.76]Yeah, it seems like it.
[47:12.02]We're looking for orange particles floating up.
[47:13.84]I need like nine dollars.
[47:17.38]Taco.
[47:19.08]Lend me not money.
[47:25.64]Where the fuck is it?
[47:27.10]Over here?
[47:28.32]I see little particles.
[47:31.68]They look like orange particles.
[47:32.89]I got it.
[47:33.17]It's right here on me.
[47:35.77]I'm going full boss killer mode.
[47:39.45]Alright.
[47:40.83]Should we do it?
[47:41.31]I guess we just punch it.
[47:42.41]I don't know.
[47:42.93]I guess.
[47:43.39]Punch it.
[47:43.69]Let's go.
[47:44.45]Before it gets too hard.
[47:45.39]Before it gets too late.
[47:45.93]Let's focus the boss.
[47:47.48]We're in a bit of a corner back against the wall.
[47:49.30]It's jellyfish two.
[47:50.36]We got this.
[47:52.56]Jellyfish sucks.
[47:53.68]We can kill this thing.
[47:57.06]Too bad we have to look through the water to do it.
[48:03.87]Get rid of these guys first.
[48:04.75]They're kind of just causing a problem.
[48:08.03]Yeah, I do so much boss damage.
[48:09.64]Here's full crits.
[48:17.54]Got it.
[48:17.86]He's dead.
[48:18.70]Alright, easy.
[48:20.10]Now, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:22.14]There's, like, boss items here.
[48:23.22]I'm not gonna Diablo II you.
[48:24.59]I'm not gonna, like, kill Bale.
[48:25.37]Alright, well, you got the last two.
[48:26.39]I get these two.
[48:27.25]Alright.
[48:27.97]But, but, but, what about me?
[48:29.41]They're both mine.
[48:30.13]Alright, come on.
[48:31.03]I accidentally Baled you.
[48:32.11]You got the first two.
[48:32.87]That accident doesn't matter.
[48:34.13]We're even.
[48:34.65]We're square now.
[48:35.33]They're two Bandoliers.
[48:36.57]I was the asshole that killed Bale and everybody's computer freezes, but that person somehow got the click first.
[48:44.08]Eye for an eye.
[48:44.78]Justice has been served.
[48:48.38]I have a chance on drop to reset cooldowns.
[48:51.30]It was always such bullshit because it was the audio loading his death animation and what would happen is you'd get some sorcerers that would come in and just melt the fuck out of him before he did his first line.
[49:02.30]I don't know this rapper.
[49:05.05]And it would load his second audio clip and crash everybody's computer and that one sorceress got to take everything.
[49:10.91]It was bullshit.
[49:16.92]They'd kill him before he got his fucking second line.
[49:18.88]Alright, we're ready to go.
[49:20.43]Do we have any more boxes, or are we ready?
[49:22.01]There's probably boxes, but we're in hard now.
[49:26.13]We are in hard, yeah.
[49:28.03]The cusp of hard mode.
[49:29.49]You only knew this because you were the sorcerer.
[49:31.53]No, I know this because I was the victim of a sorcerer.
[49:36.80]Why are they locked with, like, tendrils?
[49:39.80]It's money.
[49:40.38]Money, money.
[49:41.16]Spend the money, quick.
[49:42.28]Yeah, but the boxes were locked.
[49:44.50]They had, like, orange tendrils around them.
[49:48.98]Alright, I'm going to the teleporter.
[49:49.92]What do you mean you're going to the teleporter?
[49:51.52]What about the boxes?
[49:52.04]I'm entering the teleporter.
[49:53.24]Oh, shit.
[49:54.76]Oh, my money's all gone.
[49:58.85]I ran past three boxes.
[50:03.83]They're all locked.
[50:05.67]You can't loot because the teleporter's charging.
[50:08.73]Well, everybody, we were saying let's go get the boxes and we both left the teleporter.
[50:13.23]Before you say anything, man, hold on.
[50:14.73]I mean, snow level.
[50:16.43]Pog.
[50:18.70]We're already halfway through hard.
[50:25.18]Alright, get... That wasn't my decision.
[50:28.42]I didn't make that decision.
[50:29.37]He did.
[50:30.79]Whatever.
[50:31.11]Here comes the angry chat.
[50:32.25]Bring it on.
[50:33.45]I deal... I deal with cross-eyed angry little people like you every day, chat.
[50:40.01]You understand?
[50:42.13]Tell me how you really feel.
[50:46.87]Give me your rage emojis, okay?
[50:49.05]They feed me.
[50:51.00]Dude, pay attention to the game.
[50:54.74]Next to you, I know, you'll be talking about like lemon basil lemonade.
[50:58.48]God, like focus.
[51:00.61]This is gonna hurt me.
[51:02.45]I don't like that.
[51:03.41]Return this game.
[51:03.97]I'm gonna refund it.
[51:04.65]It's been two hours.
[51:09.11]This thing has so much health.
[51:13.95]Look, the only boxes we missed were active item boxes.
[51:16.67]Everything else has been looted.
[51:19.01]Because we're just too good at this game now.
[51:20.56]Alright, I can pick an item.
[51:21.36]I can pick either, like, baby, lunchbox, or bullets.
[51:25.30]Which one?
[51:25.66]I'm going to do baby.
[51:29.58]Chance to block incoming damage.
[51:38.28]This thing is fucking crazy.
[51:39.56]These guys have a lot of health.
[51:42.62]Yeah, they do.
[51:48.02]Oh, he hits you from the top, too.
[51:49.27]It's like balls and shit.
[51:54.27]Yeah, because we're on hard.
[51:55.57]We're about to be in very hard.
[51:56.99]Yeah, we're just about to lose, basically.
[52:01.23]Faster.
[52:01.69]Alright.
[52:01.97]Okay.
[52:02.33]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[52:05.47]Find the teleporter.
[52:06.55]We're about to get destroyed.
[52:07.63]It's also like ice enemies that slow you down and freeze you.
[52:14.31]I have so much money though, hold on.
[52:16.83]Is there a box on the way?
[52:18.11]Alright, the particles are this way.
[52:24.63]Yep, there's a teleporter right there.
[52:33.01]I don't know, it's wearing very hard.
[52:34.83]We gotta do it now.
[52:36.87]Do we?
[52:37.55]What's the hardest difficulty?
[52:39.68]What is it?
[52:39.96]Does it cap or does it just keep going to like very, very, very, very, very hard?
[52:44.60]I don't know.
[52:44.96]I think we could afford to get like one or two more boxes.
[52:48.52]I have like 500 bucks.
[52:55.01]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[52:55.97]Why is everybody laughing so hard?
[53:01.17]What are you doing?
[53:03.39]Everybody is laughing.
[53:05.33]Why?
[53:07.55]What is going on?
[53:12.23]They're just laughing preemptively because they expect us to die.
[53:15.19]Oh, that's the name.
[53:16.07]The hardest difficulty is in all capitals.
[53:18.05]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[53:20.73]Oh.
[53:22.17]I see.
[53:22.85]But apparently there's like 20 difficulties.
[53:25.93]This is so cool.
[53:28.13]Yeah, now that we haven't kept dying the third time in a row, we're actually playing the game.
[53:33.34]I'm going to hit every single one of those auto attacks.
[53:37.41]Yes, I just called it an auto attack, and I'm sorry.
[53:39.83]Somebody's gonna be like, what is this?
[53:41.91]MMO?
[53:42.23]I gotta get my last hits in.
[53:44.05]Alright, I'm turning it on.
[53:46.39]What?
[53:47.05]Should I turn this on, or should we get more stuff?
[53:49.16]The teleporter?
[53:50.94]Yeah.
[53:51.34]I'm pretty far away.
[53:52.90]Well, just try to get a couple more boxes.
[53:54.74]We're in very hard now.
[54:01.35]They're being very greedy with the boxes this time.
[54:11.23]Why don't we unlock a new character?
[54:13.15]Why don't we unlock new stuff?
[54:16.93]Do we just buy it?
[54:21.39]Well, at this point, I would call this an item run.
[54:29.36]I don't see any more boxes around.
[54:30.58]This is like a money box.
[54:32.80]I almost just died to a default enemy.
[54:39.75]If we can complete this teleporter here, we will unlock in new character.
[54:49.51]This is $2,666.
[54:49.95]It's gigantic.
[54:51.67]Do you have that kind of money?
[54:55.23]No, I got $900.
[54:57.30]Can we pool our money together somehow and buy this mega... What is this thing?
[55:01.54]Look at this drone, man.
[55:04.18]That's two charges of your utility skill?
[55:09.84]That sounds kind of good.
[55:16.26]How much is this game?
[55:18.52]Uh... $19?
[55:19.54]That's pretty good.
[55:22.60]20 bucks?
[55:22.86]$19.99?
[55:22.88]$20?
[55:23.46]It's also only the first character.
[55:26.10]There's like six total characters in the early access right now.
[55:29.02]Alright, we gotta go turn the teleporter on.
[55:31.57]There's no more boxes here.
[55:32.97]Holy shit, I can do that twice.
[55:33.85]Alright, let's go.
[55:34.51]Let's go.
[55:34.99]Unless you want to grind another, like, $1,000 and get the Super Drum...
[55:41.43]This is cool.
[55:42.41]Alright, let's go.
[55:43.29]We gotta turn it on.
[55:44.73]Otherwise, it's gonna get too super hard.
[55:46.53]Is this on consoles at all, or just PC?
[56:00.41]I don't know.
[56:01.11]I have a triple roll.
[56:02.61]Wow.
[56:04.13]Alright, let's do it.
[56:06.08]Oh, dear.
[56:07.48]Yep.
[56:08.99]I just rolled off the edge.
[56:09.79]No, I didn't.
[56:10.15]Thank God.
[56:13.46]Uh, we got, like, a lava worm on the ice level.
[56:18.92]Is that the boss?
[56:19.56]I don't know, but I'm trying to, like, clear... I don't know.
[56:23.18]Yeah, the worm is, like, flying around.
[56:27.80]God, there's so many fucking enemies here.
[56:34.86]Oh dear.
[56:36.86]He's just flying around.
[56:38.04]Oh my, I'm gonna die.
[56:42.76]There's too many enemies.
[56:45.24]Are you alright?
[56:46.24]I'm gonna bring my drone over to you.
[56:48.42]My drone just found me finally.
[56:53.29]We just gotta last.
[56:54.23]This is not a race.
[56:56.75]Oh, you're right on top of me.
[57:06.53]Oh god.
[57:11.81]What are we at?
[57:13.57]59%?
[57:14.03]Ow.
[57:19.46]My Tron can't heal fast enough.
[57:21.66]There's too many people.
[57:23.33]There's so many. 74!
[57:37.00]Ahhhh!
[57:38.00]So many heads!
[57:38.76]89!
[57:40.70]No!
[57:40.86]94!
[57:41.10]I got it.
[57:49.03]Alright, we got it.
[57:56.20]We got it.
[57:56.50]Alright, he's only got third.
[57:58.72]No one's spawning.
[58:00.16]Enemies no longer spawn.
[58:04.53]Alright, so focus on the adds then.
[58:06.23]Yeah.
[58:06.59]Oh my god.
[58:10.62]I'm dead.
[58:11.56]Are you?
[58:12.50]Yep.
[58:12.96]I died inside this.
[58:15.88]You can do it.
[58:18.16]I will try.
[58:19.18]There is nowhere for me to go.
[58:20.28]Alright, I think we're good.
[58:28.27]Almost.
[58:35.35]Do you choose who loses rockets or is it just random chance?
[58:37.89]I think it's random.
[58:38.61]Alright, you got this.
[58:53.43]This is fucking crazy.
[59:02.00]I missed every shot.
[59:03.10]Stupid idiot.
[59:03.88]Sorry.
[59:04.08]Because you can't look straight up.
[59:05.52]I know.
[59:06.42]I just figured that out right now.
[59:07.56]Oh, my God.
[59:10.08]He's going to land on me.
[59:12.11]Wow.
[59:12.45]Three rolls?
[59:13.29]Yeah.
[59:13.71]Three rolls.
[59:13.95]I am very jealous of that.
[59:14.99]That's like huge survivability.
[59:18.81]I know.
[59:19.17]It's great.
[59:22.19]There we go.
[59:22.81]See you later.
[59:25.79]We did it.
[59:27.42]How do I revive you?
[59:28.54]Oh, two guitars!
[59:29.66]You get both the guitars, and then I come back.
[59:31.64]I get two guitars?
[59:32.82]You get both of them, yeah.
[59:34.84]His music was electric.
[59:38.37]Wow.
[59:38.91]Alright, so... Should I just pick up stuff, or should we just go?
[59:43.85]Um... Up to you, I guess.
[59:46.01]Let me just see if there's anything in the vicinity.
[59:47.47]There's something right here.
[59:48.07]Let me just get this and we'll go.
[59:53.25]There's a couple things here.
[59:54.06]Let me just pick it up.
[59:57.31]It's a heal thing.
[59:58.63]What's this?
[59:59.57]I haven't really noticed the med kit working.
[60:03.73]Yeah, it's weird.
[60:04.85]Sprint faster.
[60:05.97]Can I buy more than one?
[60:06.87]No.
[60:07.05]Alright, there's a couple boxes this way.
[60:13.13]I wish we would have found this cave before we started.
[60:15.41]Yeah, seriously.
[60:18.10]I think we both went in with like a thousand bucks.
[60:20.56]Yeah.
[60:23.44]Alright, after I get up the top here, I'm just going to drop down.
[60:26.71]Yes, guys, I know I won't get the third... The character unlock!
[60:30.27]Too bad I'm never gonna play... Yeah, apparently you only get it if you kill that enemy, but it's too bad I'm never gonna play this game again, so I'll never get another chance to unlock it.
[60:39.18]You don't unlock that even if you're in, like, the party?
[60:41.92]Apparently.
[60:43.46]Yeah, I guess I'm just uninstalling when we die.
[60:47.78]God, but what an uninstallable... What an uninstallatable game.
[60:51.33]You know what I mean?
[60:58.37]Did you know if you die after the third level, both of us, the game uninstalls itself?
[61:01.64]That's what people in chat are saying.
[61:02.66]And you never get to play it again.
[61:06.02]It's so relatable to uninstall it.
[61:09.18]I don't even know what the word I just said was.
[61:13.52]Well, let's just go.
[61:14.10]This is like our first real run.
[61:17.40]Might as well just go.
[61:25.05]Uninstallatable.
[61:25.73]There it is.
[61:29.76]Alright, so for my chat, I want you to notice the different... Look, press tab and just look at the itemization there.
[61:38.35]Yeah, what about it?
[61:40.81]Look how many more you've got than me.
[61:45.73]Yeah, well, it's called... I've been buying only two of those items that were illegal items that I got for free.
[61:53.62]You also got two items for the boss.
[61:54.78]I wasn't making any accusations.
[61:56.18]I was just merely pointing out.
[61:59.02]There's a dramatic difference there.
[62:01.50]You got two free boss items, remember?
[62:03.14]Yeah, I'm not complaining.
[62:04.98]I'm just saying I think it's funny.
[62:07.84]Oh, yeah, I just think it's funny.
[62:11.08]Yeah, I just want to point out, I think it's kind of funny.
[62:12.74]Listen, what would my complaint be?
[62:14.56]I'm not saying you like sniping items.
[62:16.38]I'm saying that you've just got a lot more.
[62:17.98]I'm just kidding.
[62:22.62]But I mean, if I had to point any fingers, I'm just kidding.
[62:26.81]See, now it comes out.
[62:28.17]Well, guys, all it takes is time.
[62:30.37]All it takes is like a few minutes of prodding and you'll get it out.
[62:37.61]Whoa.
[62:40.26]These jump pads go... This is a very vertical level here.
[62:43.02]How do you dodge that shit?
[62:45.58]Just to run away?
[62:46.94]He's gonna do it again.
[62:47.50]This level looks crazy.
[62:53.71]Yeah, when he does the big laser beam, dude, you have to just line aside something.
[62:58.53]Ohaya!
[63:01.11]I'm gonna die to a normal boss.
[63:02.39]Something behind me?
[63:07.16]Yeah, this is just like a random, like, elite enemy, huh?
[63:15.16]We're on impossible difficulty now, by the way.
[63:17.68]Yeah, we are.
[63:21.57]That's why it takes so long to kill one person.
[63:27.27]Do I have enough money to buy shit?
[63:30.83]A mask.
[63:32.31]I can summon a ghost if I kill something?
[63:39.00]It's like some Luigi's Mansion music.
[63:43.70]I like it.
[63:44.30]Another huge guy.
[63:52.42]Oh, that's one of my ghosts.
[63:53.39]Okay, I can get it.
[63:54.19]Where's the big dude?
[63:56.77]down here.
[63:57.03]Whoa!
[64:02.12]Watch out for that ship.
[64:04.30]I need this.
[64:04.80]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[64:16.70]Yeah, I'm pretty much just gonna die to regular, like, elites.
[64:20.91]In a moment.
[64:22.19]Very, very high health.
[64:25.13]I'll be happy if we can take this guy down.
[64:31.52]Uh-oh, I just prayed to the Shrine of Combat.
[64:33.54]It was a huge mistake.
[64:35.12]Chance to stun on hit.
[64:36.22]Coming to me.
[64:36.76]Quickly.
[64:37.88]You?
[64:38.44]Oh, God.
[64:38.70]Yes, right now.
[64:39.62]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[64:43.99]What do you need?
[64:45.19]I just need you to shoot everyone behind me.
[64:46.91]Okay.
[64:49.33]Oh, God.
[64:51.13]We have, like, too many bosses here.
[64:55.45]Should I not have done that?
[64:56.51]I just pressed it.
[64:57.91]Oh, no.
[64:58.87]Ocular HD HUD?
[65:01.28]Wait, did I just press it?
[65:03.28]Okay, I get it.
[65:04.56]Oh, my God, we're dead.
[65:05.04]Well, it was fun.
[65:09.74]It was fun.
[65:13.86]That was good.
[65:16.74]Hold on.
[65:17.31]I was out of my element there.
[65:18.37]We're not dead yet.
[65:21.70]Yet.
[65:23.14]Minus 103 health is what I ended with.
[65:26.78]Oh, God.
[65:27.60]Yeah.
[65:28.04]Well, that was a good run.
[65:30.04]So today I learned praying to the Shrine of Combat is a challenge.
[65:36.99]And if you pray to it, you must be prepared for the elite summons.
[65:41.41]So we unlock stuff.
[65:44.07]Monster lock beetle.
[65:46.82]This item will now randomly appear in the runs.
[65:49.30]Advancement.
[65:50.52]So we unlocked a few more items.
[65:52.80]Elder Lemurians.
[65:55.00]Cool.
[65:59.68]Cool.
[66:00.04]To be honest, the commando kind of sucks.
[66:02.17]Well, he is the starter character, so... This is cool.
[66:06.39]That's what I've got.
[66:07.27]Now there's the Huntress behind me.
[66:09.11]Yeah.
[66:11.09]So there's a stray fire-seeking arrow for 150% damage.
[66:13.97]Can be used while sprinting.
[66:17.56]Laser Glaive.
[66:20.16]Glaive that bounces six times.
[66:22.14]Damage increased by 10% per bounce.
[66:25.74]Instead of a dodge, it's a blink.
[66:29.62]And then Arrow Rain.
[66:32.96]Cool.
[66:39.20]Alright, I mean, I'll try it.
[66:49.99]It's Frodian's birthday today?
[66:51.48]Happy birthday, Frodian.
[67:00.60]So this is like a bow and arrow.
[67:02.76]I'm so ready for this.
[67:06.03]Yeah, you've got different powers now.
[67:07.71]Yeah.
[67:08.65]You've got unique abilities.
[67:10.09]What's your basic attack?
[67:11.63]Obviously it's the bow, but I wonder... I think everyone's basic attack is different.
[67:15.98]Let's find out.
[67:17.02]And maybe it's not a burst fire.
[67:18.70]Maybe it's just one shot.
[67:21.10]It is... Is this like EDF?
[67:23.16]Yes.
[67:23.84]Um... What?
[67:29.60]It's a homing shot.
[67:32.22]It... It really is just... You get aimbot.
[67:36.32]You just... Do you have aimbot now?
[67:37.40]You just have to put the cursor somewhere near them and then press the button.
[67:41.48]That's pretty awesome.
[67:44.22]Is it like weaker shots to compensate, I guess, probably?
[67:47.25]Well, you shoot, it's less.
[67:48.47]It's like one, two, three, instead of like... No meat.
[67:58.61]Alright, we understand what's going on here.
[68:00.13]Let's get it going.
[68:02.76]There's like the glaive, right?
[68:04.00]Cool.
[68:09.59]Now what does this do?
[68:10.99]Woah, rain of arrows!
[68:12.61]That looks sweet.
[68:13.37]Okay, that's the dodge.
[68:14.49]That goes a long way.
[68:15.78]Alright, let's open up some boxes.
[68:21.78]Oh, here's the, um, teleporter.
[68:27.31]What do I get?
[68:28.73]Rubik's cube?
[68:35.04]Feels like I'm getting the same power-ups.
[68:37.18]The range, though, here's the thing about, I cannot physically shoot the weapon if somebody's not, like, in range.
[68:44.11]Oh, really?
[68:44.67]Yeah, they have to be, like, within range to hit them.
[68:48.81]That was that box.
[68:50.35]Already got that one.
[68:51.63]Where's the other one?
[68:52.09]It was standing right next to it.
[68:54.87]Oh, no, that's just a jump.
[68:56.85]RNG, baby.
[68:59.41]See, I have the same loadout.
[69:13.29]Cool.
[69:13.45]Alright.
[69:14.81]Boxes.
[69:15.15]I need open.
[69:16.99]55.
[69:17.19]That is a gunner drone.
[69:21.58]Oh, you can sprint while shooting, too.
[69:23.04]That's cool.
[69:24.20]Oh, that is pretty handy.
[69:26.16]Four of these glasses.
[69:27.10]Which one of these do I want?
[69:27.96]Give me this one.
[69:31.80]Healing orb on kill.
[69:32.63]Alright.
[69:33.75]What do you think?
[69:36.95]You can blink up, too.
[69:38.07]Well, that's kind of insane.
[69:44.55]You ready to start this?
[69:47.01]Um, I guess so.
[69:49.06]Let's get this party started.
[69:51.26]Hold on, I'm running towards you.
[69:52.86]Pretty far away.
[69:56.26]Coming back into the fray.
[69:57.62]It's a beetle queen.
[70:08.15]Need more money.
[70:15.61]Wow, that hurt.
[70:16.03]Alright, where's the boss?
[70:20.65]Oh, there it is.
[70:21.17]Back here.
[70:25.15]So, bugs are bad.
[70:26.70]Bugs are bad.
[70:29.12]Oops.
[70:32.98]How far does this go?
[70:34.22]It goes pretty far, actually.
[70:38.27]How much damage does my little piercing shot do?
[70:42.07]44.
[70:42.09]Nice.
[70:44.51]That's pretty good.
[70:50.57]Can you believe we died on this level?
[70:51.87]Yeah, but we didn't know what the hell was going on.
[70:56.35]Yeah, but like now it seems like a foreign concept.
[71:00.01]I don't understand how.
[71:01.72]Because I feel like I'm not trying.
[71:02.94]I picked up one boss item.
[71:04.62]Alright, you get the other one.
[71:06.28]But you also remember, like, we just installed the game.
[71:08.60]Yeah, we did just install it.
[71:11.60]It's an onion.
[71:13.60]Beetle guard.
[71:15.20]Alright, box time.
[71:16.22]We have plenty of time.
[71:16.94]We're stealing easy.
[71:17.85]Is this your friend?
[71:18.63]I don't... Is this your guy?
[71:19.71]I have, like, a beetle friend.
[71:21.57]What?
[71:22.39]Yeah.
[71:22.91]It was one of the boss... It was a boss item.
[71:26.51]Can he die?
[71:27.19]He's doing like AoE like he's a third character.
[71:30.93]Alright, 148 bucks.
[71:32.47]If you have the money, spend it.
[71:41.10]I keep shooting him thinking he's a bad guy.
[71:46.86]Resets cooldowns.
[71:49.48]Yeah, if you hold tab, you can mouse over the items too.
[71:51.88]I got a healing drone now.
[71:53.04]Those are so useful.
[71:53.86]Healing drones are so good.
[71:56.87]What about one of these shrines?
[71:57.93]Reactivated?
[72:00.65]Which one?
[72:01.51]There's one down here.
[72:02.11]I don't have enough money to do that.
[72:03.38]No, yeah, I do.
[72:08.88]I don't know where to go for more boxes.
[72:10.40]What is purple money?
[72:13.28]I don't think we have purple money yet.
[72:14.58]Alright, I'm ready to teleport.
[72:20.10]Hold on.
[72:20.56]I still have $160.
[72:21.36]Whenever you're ready.
[72:26.85]I don't want to 3D print this.
[72:29.79]That's an RNG shrine, not an item shrine.
[72:31.57]Cool.
[72:31.85]Good to know.
[72:35.37]Oh, is it changing my items into med kits?
[72:40.17]Oh, that's what that does.
[72:42.94]Oh, I'm changing my good items into the worst item in the game.
[72:46.10]I see.
[72:46.36]Uh-oh.
[72:47.14]Yeah, I like the extra challenge.
[72:49.94]Ready to rock and roll?
[72:50.56]I had no idea of what that machine does.
[72:53.72]You gamble from stuff at that shrine.
[72:58.84]Alright, time's ticking.
[72:59.56]You ready?
[73:00.46]Hold on.
[73:00.84]Just get up!
[73:04.34]Easy, easy!
[73:05.94]I'm gambling.
[73:06.56]I got an evil teddy.
[73:12.44]Dio's best friend.
[73:13.42]Tie the clock.
[73:15.58]We're gonna get to be 75 years old when we get to Hard.
[73:18.18]Alright!
[73:19.30]Go, go, go, go!
[73:20.46]It's about facing your fears and racing... the time.
[73:24.75]I get to come back to life once.
[73:28.92]I have a cheat death.
[73:31.46]Alright.
[73:35.12]Nice.
[73:36.76]Activate.
[73:37.12]Oh, nice.
[73:37.58]Here we go.
[73:46.33]I can see why people think this is really fun.
[73:49.59]You can see why, but you don't think so personally?
[73:51.45]No.
[73:51.87]Yeah, I agree.
[73:54.91]No.
[73:55.98]I'm joking.
[73:56.34]I'm joking.
[73:58.58]I think it's fun.
[73:59.12]It's fun.
[73:59.54]Oh, well, I just kill stole you.
[74:03.36]Sorry.
[74:04.94]Sorry, Geb.
[74:06.00]What was his name?
[74:07.81]Geb.
[74:08.49]What was his name?
[74:09.31]Bring back Smite.
[74:10.37]Yeah.
[74:11.55]No, Jeb.
[74:12.09]That was what it was.
[74:12.85]Alright.
[74:25.16]Do I have money?
[74:26.00]I have money.
[74:26.54]Let's buy some stuff.
[74:31.24]So what was my other item that I got besides the teddy?
[74:34.56]Attack speed up?
[74:35.21]Alright, there's a lunar item here on this part of the level.
[74:40.13]Alright, come on.
[74:40.61]I gotta hurry up.
[74:41.31]It's all about speed.
[74:50.35]There's too many places to go.
[74:51.61]There's too many things to see.
[74:52.73]Okay, there's another one of these.
[74:55.05]Chance to bleed again.
[75:01.86]It's a geb bush.
[75:06.86]Down... What's a safe way to get down without dying of fall damage?
[75:15.94]I think you can dodge right before.
[75:18.29]Really?
[75:19.31]Okay.
[75:19.69]I may have just accidentally read that in chat and I think that's... No, it's true.
[75:23.61]It is, right?
[75:24.73]Yeah, it works.
[75:25.83]I got knowledge.
[75:27.59]Sometimes.
[75:28.03]Thanks, Taco.
[75:35.64]Enough money to buy this?
[75:36.76]Yes.
[75:38.42]What did you drop?
[75:40.58]Did he just drop a box?
[75:42.37]Or was that just here?
[75:43.03]Alright, we're in medium now.
[75:51.27]That is the way I like my cheeseburgers.
[75:57.41]This was not wise, what I just did.
[76:00.03]I just got two medkits.
[76:01.23]Look away, chat.
[76:02.77]I thought I could move.
[76:03.39]Alright, we gotta find the teleported.
[76:06.00]We're spending too much time here.
[76:09.32]Listen.
[76:09.70]I looked over the chat and it was just like, you guys are fucking idiots.
[76:12.88]Stupid fucking morons.
[76:14.29]Like, hurry the fuck up.
[76:15.31]Like, it's all I see in the chat.
[76:16.99]It's kind of, like, crazy.
[76:25.25]Like, they specifically keep calling out you in particular.
[76:28.38]They keep going, like, Etalyx.
[76:29.48]God damn it.
[76:30.64]And, like, they capitalize the damn it.
[76:32.18]So it's, like, really, like, emphasized and rude.
[76:36.58]Good.
[76:36.94]Tell them to say it to my face.
[76:37.80]Oh, shit.
[76:38.10]That's the wrong chat.
[76:38.96]Sorry.
[76:42.75]I was in your chat.
[76:43.43]Sorry.
[76:44.83]Oh, that makes more sense.
[76:49.11]Like, I was in your chat.
[76:52.87]That's reasonable now.
[76:55.41]Not as far fetched as it once was.
[77:03.06]Have you found the teleporter yet?
[77:04.34]No.
[77:05.70]Oh.
[77:09.10]I'm trying.
[77:09.56]Me neither.
[77:10.36]Look for the orange sprinkles.
[77:15.02]The orange sprinkle dust.
[77:16.66]Yeah.
[77:20.80]There's a lot of items down here.
[77:23.15]What is this?
[77:24.38]What's this moon?
[77:25.18]What's the moon thing mean?
[77:26.82]You see that too, right?
[77:28.84]The moon?
[77:29.32]It's got a question mark.
[77:30.52]Ooh.
[77:32.30]Offer to Shrine of Blood.
[77:33.58]Lose 50% HP.
[77:34.88]No.
[77:35.94]You do that.
[77:40.37]What did it do?
[77:40.97]It didn't do anything.
[77:48.47]It gives you money.
[77:49.11]If I do it, it's 75%.
[77:50.03]Oh, shit.
[77:50.75]I got money.
[77:51.47]Okay, it gives you money.
[77:54.01]So, like, do you get your health back or is it permanently gone?
[77:56.73]No, I have 279 HP.
[77:59.46]So if I do it, I'm not going to... Whatever, I'll do it.
[78:02.36]Yeah, you get 100 and... You get gold.
[78:06.98]Turret down here.
[78:07.68]3D print this.
[78:17.28]I like that.
[78:18.33]What about this?
[78:19.11]Just open it.
[78:19.69]I need to find more boxes now.
[78:21.05]Come over here.
[78:21.35]I got something for you.
[78:22.07]Oh, I got the Rubik's Cube.
[78:23.45]We're gonna have to... We're gonna have to... Get the... Oh, over here.
[78:31.27]We can both have a Rubik's Cube.
[78:32.57]Right there.
[78:33.31]This?
[78:33.89]Yeah, to get it.
[78:34.75]It's inactive.
[78:37.64]But... I have eight seconds of crit, so which one's better?
[78:41.06]Oh, shit.
[78:41.40]I don't know.
[78:42.04]Maybe I should take them both.
[78:42.96]Yeah, I don't think I can carry both.
[78:45.81]Alright, we gotta activate this.
[78:47.07]I gotta find a fucking teleporter.
[78:50.81]Is crowbar good?
[78:52.95]Uh, yeah, I think so.
[78:57.80]Does it take a random item in the 3D printer?
[79:00.00]I still don't understand how that works.
[79:02.82]To change to the thing.
[79:04.84]Or... I'm sure we'll figure it out.
[79:08.96]Takes a random one.
[79:13.81]What's that?
[79:14.45]I think it's first in line on the left.
[79:16.24]Ooh, it's slow.
[79:18.82]I would lose my shield.
[79:20.26]What's this?
[79:21.10]Another fuckin' cube, I already have one of these.
[79:26.44]Have we even found the tel- it's gotta be up.
[79:28.23]It's a random item of the same tier.
[79:30.35]We're almost in heart.
[79:31.27]Random item of the same tier.
[79:32.27]Yeah, we're spending way too much time here.
[79:34.33]Random item of the same tier.
[79:41.16]Printers take random items of the same rarity, preferring duplicates.
[79:45.82]And it's a random item of the same tier.
[79:51.68]What's this one?
[79:53.75]Ooh.
[79:54.61]Stun grenade.
[79:56.65]There's no order to it.
[79:57.49]It's just random.
[79:58.17]Good to know.
[79:59.11]Oh, where is this teleporter?
[80:02.99]Where is the teleporter?
[80:04.55]Turn invisible on taking heavy damage.
[80:06.97]That's cool.
[80:10.32]It has to be up.
[80:11.10]It's gotta be.
[80:18.20]Yeah, it's gotta be like on one of these platforms somewhere.
[80:22.99]It's over there where I'm pointing.
[80:24.35]Where?
[80:24.69]Point at the screen.
[80:25.85]Point?
[80:27.09]Just draw a line with your finger.
[80:28.59]With your greasy fingers.
[80:31.96]And like cosmic knowledge, you know what I mean?
[80:35.28]Like if every single one of you, there's like what?
[80:36.90]3,000 people here?
[80:43.34]3500, something like that?
[80:44.76]Total?
[80:46.24]If all of you point at the same part of the screen, like, will I sense it?
[80:49.94]Because, like... You have to have the heat map on for that.
[80:55.91]You have to turn the heat map on right now.
[81:00.73]Turn on smart click.
[81:01.79]Yeah, that is what it would be.
[81:06.81]Uh, is it down here?
[81:07.49]I think I see it.
[81:11.72]Uh...
[81:15.03]I don't know.
[81:17.67]I haven't seen any orange sparkles.
[81:20.95]Down here?
[81:21.99]It's down here.
[81:26.09]Oh, come on.
[81:27.63]We actually missed it.
[81:28.81]Is this bugged?
[81:29.73]Fail the Shrine of Chance three times in a row.
[81:32.60]We missed it.
[81:33.38]We went down here already.
[81:34.74]That's not a nice achievement that I just got.
[81:45.13]Any other items and boxes and shit down here?
[81:47.84]We gotta turn this on, man.
[81:49.02]We're gonna be in hard.
[81:52.56]Four in a row?
[81:53.30]Come on!
[81:53.92]Is this bugged?
[81:56.28]Did you get that achievement?
[81:57.28]No, you did.
[81:58.78]Yeah, I got it, um... I activated the Shrine of Chance and failed four times in a row.
[82:03.76]I lost $300.
[82:04.06]I just went to the casino.
[82:09.77]And then came back to the stream.
[82:12.09]I have so many little drones everywhere.
[82:14.92]A coin?
[82:15.28]What a coin?
[82:15.80]Coins?
[82:17.02]A coin.
[82:18.24]Alright, you ready?
[82:19.28]Wait, wait, wait.
[82:20.04]Literally a coin.
[82:21.34]Where?
[82:22.68]Get the coin.
[82:23.40]What do you mean coin?
[82:25.26]Where's the coin?
[82:28.77]Do you see a coin?
[82:31.23]If I did, would I tell you?
[82:32.23]I would just take it.
[82:33.09]Is that it?
[82:33.45]Alright, I found it.
[82:36.03]Oh, there is a coin.
[82:36.73]There is like a giant blue coin.
[82:39.23]Yeah, there's a coin right there.
[82:42.75]Oh!
[82:42.93]Did I get it?
[82:44.55]Does this travel with us?
[82:48.60]Tanner, whatever your name is.
[82:49.92]Tano Taco.
[82:53.54]Do I have to spend this here?
[82:54.52]Alright, we gotta turn this on, man.
[83:00.55]We're gonna get overwhelmed.
[83:04.99]Well, what are you waiting for?
[83:06.41]I just turned it on.
[83:10.24]What is it?
[83:11.16]Beetle Queen.
[83:13.26]The Beetle Queen has arrived.
[83:17.44]Where?
[83:18.82]I don't know.
[83:20.01]Maybe she can't fit down here.
[83:23.01]Anybody see a Beetle Queen?
[83:26.31]Keep shooting your stupid companion.
[83:28.89]Oh, she's back here.
[83:29.95]It's a very nice companion, though.
[83:34.93]Don't be mean to my companion.
[83:38.40]Don't worry.
[83:40.13]Okay, then I won't.
[83:41.47]I forgot this is not a dodge roll.
[83:42.60]I may have just killed myself.
[83:43.60]To be fair, though, your companion is blocking my permacrits.
[83:56.92]Alright, what do we got?
[83:57.48]What do we got for items?
[84:03.34]I don't even see any.
[84:05.54]A couple over here.
[84:06.80]There's one.
[84:07.28]There's a green and a... I'll take this one.
[84:09.82]Alright, I'll take this one.
[84:10.70]This is another jump, right?
[84:11.79]I want my own beetle guard.
[84:13.21]Yeah, we're gonna have two beetles.
[84:16.05]So that's good.
[84:16.71]74%.
[84:16.73]I keep forgetting I have an extra jump already.
[84:25.65]You have to scream for crits.
[84:28.87]Like, Mike activated?
[84:31.25]Beetle Queen is so easy compared to others.
[84:33.03]Alright, well, we'll have a second.
[84:35.17]Is there anything else to open down here?
[84:43.09]Something else.
[84:43.63]Come on.
[84:46.87]I don't think there is.
[84:55.33]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[85:03.08]Are you at the teleporter?
[85:04.68]Hey, you could do a 93% HP.
[85:07.03]I dare you.
[85:08.33]What?
[85:09.75]That blood pact.
[85:11.41]Yeah, but we don't have any money to spend.
[85:12.55]I mean, we don't have any... I have 500 bucks.
[85:14.25]I don't know where to spend it.
[85:15.43]Yeah, this box is... Maybe some down here?
[85:19.78]These are all open.
[85:23.00]They'd probably be the ones like elevated.
[85:24.72]The ones higher up.
[85:31.76]Just turns into XP.
[85:32.90]Yeah, let's just do it.
[85:34.10]We gotta try to get through the next thing before it gets very hard.
[85:38.56]Back to it.
[85:41.06]Do the shrine.
[85:46.29]Didn't do chance shrine.
[85:47.27]No, I didn't.
[85:47.69]Yeah, I can't spend any of this money.
[85:51.99]We gotta go.
[85:52.41]Yeah, we have to get out of here.
[85:57.14]We really do.
[86:00.48]On my way.
[86:01.32]Chance shrines are good.
[86:03.55]We'll do it next time.
[86:10.35]Chance shrine is always worth it.
[86:11.39]Well, that does not feel good, but... Do it now.
[86:16.45]Do it next time.
[86:21.53]I'll do it tomorrow.
[86:25.19]Alright, this is where we got one more after this, right?
[86:27.06]And we died on that one.
[86:28.70]We got, we were insane at that point.
[86:31.86]Let's really try to clean this up.
[86:44.93]That hurts.
[86:54.64]So, the levels increase base stats, I assume?
[86:59.08]It looks like it, yeah.
[87:03.96]Okay.
[87:04.70]Items.
[87:06.16]It's always like a dollar away.
[87:11.03]I don't... I... I don't know what that is.
[87:15.03]Why am I shooting him?
[87:15.83]He's my friend.
[87:19.29]What is this?
[87:21.74]I had that one earlier and didn't use it one time.
[87:29.13]Everyone said it sucked, so I just... That's unfortunate.
[87:35.93]I thought, oh well.
[87:42.61]That's too many.
[87:45.21]Why does this have a broken clock on it? 959.
[87:52.49]Somebody unplugged their VCR.
[87:53.91]What does that mean?
[88:01.80]There's my friends.
[88:07.70]You need to get to this level before 10 minutes.
[88:09.28]Slow enemies on hit.
[88:10.32]There we go.
[88:11.42]What is this thing?
[88:12.76]Why is it only 60 bucks?
[88:14.68]Is this like an Amazon drone?
[88:15.94]What is this?
[88:16.76]That's crazy.
[88:18.14]15 minutes on multiplayer?
[88:20.42]Oh, it's like a booster.
[88:25.01]Alright, I'm looking for one of those lunar boxes.
[88:31.51]So you can spend your lunar coin?
[88:33.21]Yeah, I mean, first time we've ever had it, might as well see what it is.
[88:36.58]I was thinking about maybe giving it to you.
[88:39.30]I was thinking about gasoline.
[88:43.70]Well, you shouldn't have.
[88:46.26]This is hurting me bad.
[88:59.42]They're really keen on the bandolier right now.
[89:02.32]Wait, save coins for a new character?
[89:04.30]I found the teleporter.
[89:07.74]Wait, you mean that currency stays forever?
[89:11.76]Yeah, the currency stays forever.
[89:14.52]Forever?
[89:15.74]Forever.
[89:16.52]What the fuck?
[89:17.20]Okay.
[89:18.60]That's good to know.
[89:24.82]You're enjoying my scarab friend down there.
[89:26.54]I assume he earns me money.
[89:30.53]Actually.
[89:31.13]Yeah.
[89:31.95]I would think so.
[89:33.99]That's pretty awesome.
[89:36.77]Alright.
[89:37.15]Give me some boxes.
[89:42.31]We might consider turning it on here in a minute.
[89:43.75]I got this stupid heal thing again.
[89:52.35]And...
[89:54.78]316 bucks.
[89:55.12]Should I pick the Missile Launcher or the Cube?
[90:02.76]Missile Launcher or Cube.
[90:04.40]Talking about actives?
[90:06.10]Probably the Cube.
[90:08.72]Yeah.
[90:10.78]It's kind of nice having the black hole for crowd control stuff.
[90:13.23]Yeah, it is.
[90:17.43]Chance... Oh, I got the Happy Mask, too.
[90:19.49]You have that?
[90:20.89]I had it last time.
[90:21.59]It was pretty good.
[90:25.36]Chance to bleed.
[90:26.14]I have a couple of these, don't I?
[90:27.40]How many of these do I have?
[90:30.63]Two.
[90:30.83]Alright, partner, what do you say?
[90:35.27]We might have to start this.
[90:35.89]Yeah, I think it's pretty much go time.
[90:40.80]You're kind of far away, though.
[90:42.22]Yeah, I'm coming back.
[90:57.55]Alright, might as well turn it on.
[90:59.07]Hang on.
[90:59.67]I got dibs on this chest real quick.
[91:01.63]This chest real quick.
[91:03.89]I just need, like, 30 more bucks.
[91:05.23]I'll just open it for you.
[91:10.35]Here, take it.
[91:11.01]Oh.
[91:13.59]Hmm.
[91:16.44]Let's go.
[91:16.70]Oh, God, I'm, like, hurt.
[91:17.48]I'm going to use this now.
[91:19.68]Like, I'm actually hurt.
[91:21.02]I need to, like, not die.
[91:21.82]Alright, what is it?
[91:24.68]Clay Dune Strider.
[91:25.60]It's a big machine.
[91:27.79]Oh, they were all grouped up for that.
[91:29.01]I love it!
[91:30.19]Did you say that was the bomb?
[91:33.01]It was great.
[91:35.43]Just keep doing that shit.
[91:54.62]So he's in the air.
[91:56.10]I don't know what that means.
[91:58.04]Pretty much just focusing the boss right now, but also dying.
[92:00.68]Oh my God.
[92:05.32]Whoa.
[92:09.73]Oh, there's more than one.
[92:10.65]He split?
[92:16.35]He's just pulling us in.
[92:18.93]Can we out range that?
[92:20.50]He's got like mechanite tendrils.
[92:29.61]Alright, one dead.
[92:31.05]One down.
[92:31.89]Oh my god, why'd I do that?
[92:32.67]I didn't mean to do that.
[92:34.41]I'm just gonna stand still.
[92:36.55]Are you getting healed?
[92:38.51]I am getting healed.
[92:40.09]By also my own bot.
[92:41.06]Alright, I'm gonna come over here.
[92:41.86]Let's see what this does.
[92:46.22]Stand in that circle?
[92:47.42]How good is the heal?
[92:49.14]Is it like actually worth doing?
[92:51.28]Uh, I don't know.
[92:56.07]Probably not.
[92:57.07]No.
[93:00.01]Well, that item is... Questionable at best.
[93:10.12]Stand still for two seconds.
[93:12.08]You got this.
[93:13.24]You're doing great.
[93:14.58]You're doing great.
[93:24.31]Is that like 10%? 15%?
[93:27.80]Come on, dots, dots, dots, dots, man.
[93:30.52]4%.
[93:30.62]2%.
[93:30.64]Hit it hard, hit it hard.
[93:34.92]Cooldowns.
[93:37.34]Warrior.
[93:38.34]Hey, my turn to get the achievement.
[93:41.38]Alright, these look the same, so I'll take one.
[93:43.50]The fungus is nicely done.
[93:48.68]For out of combat.
[93:49.58]That makes sense.
[93:53.45]Why is he still alive?
[93:54.91]I don't know.
[93:56.73]Good question.
[93:59.45]You can take both.
[94:00.31]You can take both since you're dead.
[94:01.61]I'm dead.
[94:04.46]Taking both.
[94:05.36]You're dead?
[94:05.88]Yeah, I'm dead.
[94:07.56]Wait, when did you die?
[94:08.80]Uh, when I screamed.
[94:10.48]Remember, I was like, let me try this.
[94:14.44]Let me stand still for two seconds.
[94:15.66]And I was like, you getting healed by that?
[94:16.86]I instantly died.
[94:17.92]And the meteor hit me in the head and killed me.
[94:19.88]Oh, okay.
[94:21.64]Well, I have 1,400 bucks, but I don't have anything to spend it on because I searched this whole area for boxes first.
[94:29.04]So let's just go.
[94:29.96]If you got the cash, then spend it.
[94:32.60]There was nothing to spend.
[94:33.42]Alright, we're good.
[94:34.60]Alright, this is where we got to last time, and... I'm already halfway dead.
[94:38.44]We're now on impossible.
[94:42.48]There's a weird... There's a hard balance here with trying to pick up items and going quickly.
[94:48.60]It's cool.
[94:52.21]I don't know man.
[94:52.92]We might have taken too long Yeah, but probably I mean, I'm fighting like a boss as a normal enemy.
[95:00.40]This is our wall right now This is our like newbie wall Going quickly is way more important.
[95:07.65]Yeah We got we got mechanics down pretty closely now we should probably just try and do a Like a speedy speedy runs of the first two areas.
[95:19.12]Oh
[95:21.83]Oh my God.
[95:22.37]Yeah, there's like a dinosaur boss in here.
[95:33.56]That is who has been pursuing me.
[95:39.44]Slowed.
[95:41.16]The inability to shoot straight up is very annoying against that guy.
[95:44.12]And there's some kind of turtle guy.
[95:48.05]The 10 minute chest is a real good item.
[95:51.46]Also, Geb is useless right here.
[95:55.82]Geb does not know how to pathfind.
[95:59.58]I'm dead.
[96:00.50]I think I caught fire.
[96:03.26]I'm alive again, though, because I had an item.
[96:05.46]So that's pretty cool.
[96:08.48]Okay, that giant snake thing is around.
[96:11.96]How do you stop burning to death?
[96:15.93]Roll.
[96:17.05]Like every video game, right?
[96:18.61]That's what I think, but it didn't seem to be doing anything.
[96:23.00]Well, that's really great.
[96:23.80]Wish I had that earlier.
[96:24.54]I can dash twice, three times, probably.
[96:30.76]Alright, we're just, like, circling everybody and just killing enemies.
[96:34.21]Oh, we're so fucked here.
[96:35.51]I'm trying to kill this one, like, lizard.
[96:37.87]The fire lizard.
[96:39.85]We're so dead.
[96:43.25]Looking for the teleporter He's dead that was big money big money Orange flakes I don't see any orange flakes over here wait I see an orange flake right there
[97:08.47]Alright, I got it.
[97:09.31]It's down here.
[97:10.11]We're going from impossible to I see something.
[97:13.25]I see dead people, right?
[97:17.12]Teleport is right here, so just turn it on.
[97:19.66]I'm not going to tell you not to.
[97:23.40]Because I just don't know.
[97:24.50]I'm going to die with or without it.
[97:27.06]Apparently I'm missile guy now.
[97:34.58]Maybe we'll get lucky.
[97:44.45]Alright, you ready?
[97:45.13]I'm just gonna turn it on.
[97:48.23]Who is it?
[97:51.21]Imp Overlord.
[97:53.39]Imp Overlord, alright, I'm coming to you.
[97:54.87]Thank you, no, I thought he was coming to you, alright.
[97:56.86]He doesn't have that much health.
[97:59.22]He's pretty weak.
[98:01.98]Just burn him.
[98:03.30]Hold on, I'm not even, I can't even see him, so I'm coming.
[98:07.16]I'm on my way.
[98:11.51]Yeah, I am super jump missile guy now.
[98:18.63]Alright, I'm helping.
[98:20.01]Where's he going?
[98:20.93]He's invisible.
[98:23.83]Canceled it.
[98:24.29]I think we're going to do this.
[98:31.16]He's focused on me now.
[98:34.18]And here he comes.
[98:46.45]We cleaned up a lot of enemies there.
[98:49.32]So he's intangible while invisible and cannot be hurt.
[98:52.29]Alright, we got a lot of enemies coming in.
[99:07.32]Big, uh, skull man.
[99:09.10]He's focusing the boss.
[99:10.20]He's almost... He's at like less than a quarter.
[99:12.78]I'm about to go full crit.
[99:15.40]Oh, and he just went invisible.
[99:16.32]I'm trying to take care of the adds.
[99:17.74]There's so many of them coming in.
[99:18.96]They all found us at the same time.
[99:21.44]We got it!
[99:21.94]Kill him!
[99:22.30]He's almost dead.
[99:23.10]Yes!
[99:26.85]Alright, clean this up.
[99:29.13]We're good. 97%.
[99:36.16]Uh, Shrine of the Mountain.
[99:37.54]Someone was like, wait till they pray to the Shrine of the Mountain earlier, so I'm gonna wait until we're done to, like, press that button.
[99:43.14]Alright, so that's good.
[99:43.98]You're not gonna jebait me that easily.
[99:45.74]I see you.
[99:46.80]Alright, I'm gonna get this one.
[99:47.64]You get the other one.
[99:49.80]So, uh, we can move on.
[99:51.42]You wanna pray to the Shrine of the Mountain and possibly die?
[99:54.00]Um... Somebody said it won't work now.
[99:58.68]It won't do anything now.
[99:59.53]Well, then I can still pray to it, though.
[100:02.07]You've invited the Challenge of the Mountain.
[100:06.24]Oh.
[100:06.64]So we were jubated, just not in the way we thought.
[100:09.06]So it doesn't do anything?
[100:10.48]Apparently it only does stuff before teleporting?
[100:13.86]Oh, it affects the boss fight.
[100:16.50]Oh, really?
[100:16.72]Let's bomb this guy.
[100:18.36]Holy shit, man.
[100:19.48]My heart is fucking racing.
[100:20.40]We got it.
[100:22.68]Holy shit, I can't believe it.
[100:24.42]Have you been through here?
[100:25.92]Uh, no.
[100:27.23]The new difficulty is I See You.
[100:29.57]Mm-hmm.
[100:32.13]Uh, Challenge of the Mountain makes the boss fight harder with more rewards.
[100:34.89]Yeah, I See You.
[100:36.47]Hey, chat.
[100:37.35]I see you.
[100:39.25]I got a lot of money.
[100:42.17]Well, rub it in.
[100:48.60]That took a while for me to understand what you were saying here.
[100:54.48]This is a useless tunnel for my $1,400.
[100:56.66]Is there nothing there?
[100:59.00]Absolutely zero.
[101:00.10]Alright, well.
[101:06.91]It's a very sad tunnel.
[101:08.47]Some developer worked really hard on this.
[101:09.91]Well, it's procedurally generated.
[101:13.78]They probably worked hard on the tunnel portion, but not on where it was going to end up.
[101:17.46]I can't believe Notch made this game.
[101:18.84]Alright, I'm pressing the button.
[101:21.60]You ready?
[101:23.92]Oh, no, no, no.
[101:27.15]And after I pick this up.
[101:29.65]Okay, I'm ready.
[101:35.91]We haven't seen this.
[101:38.43]detonate enemies on kill only three people made this game let me guess they're all in chat right now probably uh what's this is interesting distant back to the first stage loop back deja vu so we beat it we beat the game nice wow that's one that's one way to deal with early access am I right
[102:06.99]So now we just kinda cycle through and it gets harder?
[102:08.41]Alright, there's- I'm ca- okay, I'm ha ha ha- the- the loud laughter is coming up in a minute here.
[102:20.85]Oh, I thought that was- Oh, yes.
[102:22.05]Loud- very loud laughter.
[102:28.74]Holy shit, these guys take so many hits.
[102:36.55]So is there something after hahaha?
[102:39.93]I guess we'll have to survive long enough to find out.
[102:47.10]The answer is no, apparently.
[102:52.96]Struggling to kill one beetle.
[103:03.78]Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it.
[103:06.49]Level up.
[103:09.64]Man, these guys are so tanky.
[103:14.08]It keeps getting harder, but there's no new name for it.
[103:16.52]Okay.
[103:18.26]So it's like a progression thing, right?
[103:20.32]I think we did the equivalent of, like, Binding of Isaac beating Mom or something for the first time.
[103:27.88]So the idea is to try to get...
[103:31.81]To this point, by, like, hard.
[103:36.15]Or very hard.
[103:39.23]And just cycle around.
[103:40.29]Other people are saying, in Risk of Rain 1, like this, though it's optional, you can go to the end game or loop again.
[103:48.46]So by saying the end game, do you mean, like, start over?
[103:51.98]Or is this endless mode?
[103:55.04]Oh, every teleport increases difficulty by one, so you can't do what I'm describing.
[103:58.38]Okay, that's cool.
[104:03.25]Secret item.
[104:06.65]Glasses?
[104:08.49]Ooh, that's the crit.
[104:09.73]I gotta remember that.
[104:12.73]Here it comes!
[104:13.89]What'd you find?
[104:14.31]The ha-ha-ha.
[104:16.71]Oh.
[104:17.51]We're there.
[104:17.99]I wonder how many people are gonna get timed out.
[104:23.43]By Nightbot automatically?
[104:25.11]At some point after you loop back, you can open another portal for the end.
[104:28.83]What is this?
[104:29.67]You are embraced by the healing warmth of the woods.
[104:32.79]That's a lot of money for a heal.
[104:35.65]Well, it looks like we already have the heal.
[104:37.13]It's on the ground.
[104:38.21]This must just stay.
[104:42.52]It's nice and centralized.
[104:43.68]Oops.
[104:51.14]Got overwhelmed.
[104:54.06]Yo, those are my friends.
[104:59.08]I'm just gonna stay in the hill.
[105:01.22]Never mind, that's a bad idea.
[105:02.22]Move fast out of combat.
[105:03.51]That's a joke, right?
[105:06.29]Alright, I need to open a box.
[105:09.13]Fine, I'll activate this one too.
[105:19.46]We are in ha ha ha zone.
[105:21.06]We should probably find a teleporter, huh?
[105:23.16]It's probably, I think it's right here.
[105:24.48]And just see what ha ha ha difficulty teleporter looks like.
[105:28.04]Well, it's right next to me.
[105:29.46]You want me to press it?
[105:30.44]Yeah, it's right up here.
[105:32.52]Uh, let me open one last box.
[105:34.46]Ooh, what's that?
[105:36.06]Cheat death once.
[105:37.08]I get to die once.
[105:38.44]What is this?
[105:39.02]Gunner drone?
[105:40.58]Alright, I'll do the gunner.
[105:42.81]I'm ready.
[105:43.11]Alright, let's do it.
[105:48.21]It is the Beetle Queen on Ha Ha Ha Difficulty.
[105:52.07]So there's two healers down here.
[105:55.11]It spawns three of them, actually.
[105:56.89]My bad.
[105:57.89]Three Beetle Queens.
[106:01.57]So if you start getting low, go down into the heal fields below in the valley.
[106:06.41]Will do.
[106:06.81]Holy, okay, well, I'm doing that now.
[106:13.43]Can we make this better?
[106:14.11]No, I don't think so.
[106:21.21]Yeah, that's a pretty good escape to get down there.
[106:28.36]What do these bugs do?
[106:29.84]I think that they have like a weird AOE field.
[106:31.86]I thought it was a heal at first, but that's definitely not what it is.
[106:33.74]Oh, God.
[106:39.55]Somehow I'm just right in the middle of all of them.
[106:43.15]There's so many of them.
[106:44.59]Their circles are taking up so much screen real estate, I can't even see through them.
[106:53.04]What's going on?
[106:57.72]Suck them all in.
[107:02.45]Oh my god, there's so many people over there.
[107:07.23]There really are, they can't move over.
[107:09.61]Look at that.
[107:10.96]This is all damage numbers.
[107:12.22]That's awesome.
[107:21.94]Look at him flying around, too.
[107:24.98]I'm retreating back to the heal.
[107:27.75]Who's laughing now, game?
[107:32.05]The game's going to continue to laugh, I think, until it's over.
[107:36.91]It's a continuous laugh out loud.
[107:41.13]That is very funny.
[107:42.97]Oh, God.
[107:44.33]How am I negating so much damage?
[107:48.03]Uhhh... It's like one of these laser... Because I'm standing right next to him, like, scaring them.
[107:53.34]Whoa!
[107:53.58]Oh my god, I just... I'm dead.
[107:54.68]I just got rained on.
[107:55.84]What just dropped on me?
[107:57.86]Why am I alive again?
[107:58.62]Oh fuck, I can cheat death, right.
[108:02.06]Are those bugs dropping those?
[108:04.02]I think they might be.
[108:04.62]Maybe.
[108:06.62]I just got fucking wrecked.
[108:08.70]Alright, two out of three are dead.
[108:10.98]Whoops.
[108:12.39]Whoops.
[108:13.31]No, actually, that's a good thing.
[108:14.71]Holy shit, this is gonna be fucking wild.
[108:21.79]All these bugs!
[108:22.89]Dude, this is fucking insane.
[108:25.01]Are those your bugs?
[108:26.21]No!
[108:26.57]Oh, I'm dead.
[108:29.94]I wasn't gonna be dead, but then I died.
[108:33.20]I think I went from half health to zero.
[108:36.20]Got one shot.
[108:38.00]Oh my god, there's so many things.
[108:41.27]Please!
[108:43.53]I did most of the work for the... Oh no, there's just no way, man.
[108:47.55]No way.
[108:50.74]We got to see new stuff.
[108:56.64]That's cool.
[108:58.34]What is the red PUBG zone for?
[109:01.34]That's the teleporter charge zone.
[109:06.33]You just stand inside the red to charge the tele.
[109:08.49]That's cool.
[109:17.38]Kills.
[109:18.74]We did good.
[109:20.14]That's right.
[109:20.62]We've come a long way from dying on the first level.
[109:22.56]I unlocked a new character.
[109:24.90]Like you.
[109:27.23]The character's fun.
[109:28.57]I kind of do miss being able to aim and shoot, though.
[109:31.57]I feel like when I play this character, it... I like the AoE is amazing.
[109:40.01]But sometimes when I'm just holding the button down, it's kind of hard to tell who I'm shooting at.
[109:44.04]But still powerful.
[109:45.04]Yeah, because the bolts just kind of fly off into a random direction.
[109:49.68]Yeah.
[109:51.20]It makes sense.
[109:53.80]It's the only character with auto-aim.
[109:58.50]I'll go back to this guy.
[110:01.26]We'll switch off.
[110:02.63]Okay.
[110:03.53]Let me read my abilities first.
[110:07.49]Is there a way we can see how to unlock enemies?
[110:09.21]I mean, classes?
[110:12.77]I can't really scroll over anything.
[110:18.19]Go to the log.
[110:23.58]Logbook.
[110:26.16]Do I have to go back, though?
[110:28.86]Nah, I don't want to leave the menu.
[110:31.26]Wait, wait, am I still in a party with you if I go back to the menu?
[110:37.36]looks good you can look in the logbook to see how to unlock these apparently yeah let's let's just do that on the main menu let's just do that might as well see oh this is cool alright survivor uh complete 30 stages yep so we're probably not too far I mean we're probably like halfway re the survivor there's somebody we can free
[111:05.54]suspended in time obliterate yourself at the obelisk yeah and complete the first teleporter five times okay well we'll get this one and this one probably yeah the second and sixth for sure if you're gonna play huntress uh the best part about it is you can shoot while sprinting so just keep that in mind and we'll check it out items and equipment okay
[111:34.38]this one and this one while talking to him no he knows what I'm talking about yeah I know this is the second and fifth one the one where you do so many levels and you do the teleporter five times yeah right yeah on the same page he's got it we're on the same page alright I'm ready is there any customization um I don't think so I think they're like
[112:00.24]I don't think there is customization, but I think the thing I remember reading that they were most excited about for 3D was every item you pick up in the game is on the character somehow.
[112:09.86]That's cool.
[112:11.28]I didn't even know that was happening until you just said it.
[112:13.23]Yeah, so now you can look.
[112:14.99]If you pick up the ukulele, you get a ukulele.
[112:16.93]If you pick up the crowbar, you get a crowbar.
[112:19.85]What a fun fucking game, huh?
[112:22.55]Alright, let's play with our new friend.
[112:23.85]Alright, let's go.
[112:28.00]The Huntress.
[112:30.71]who seems a little squishy.
[112:32.11]What's your base health?
[112:33.81]Uh, 110.
[112:34.87]Yeah, so I get 20 less HP.
[112:41.36]So the theory is, let's try to just get to doing this as fast as possible.
[112:44.02]Get a couple, get one or two items, let's go.
[112:46.44]Let's try to burn through this.
[112:48.52]Find the teleporter.
[112:52.43]Grab an item.
[112:52.73]I love making me the boss killer.
[112:59.39]I got enough like what else do I have a right click?
[113:09.10]So many boxes right here.
[113:11.00]I found the teleporter.
[113:12.32]You have you ping it?
[113:13.40]Yeah.
[113:15.38]Point it.
[113:15.68]Can I get a ping?
[113:16.72]Oh.
[113:19.14]Why you like right next to it?
[113:20.27]Yeah, right here.
[113:26.95]I need a box.
[113:28.53]There's some over by me.
[113:34.57]I feel like, um, like Artemis.
[113:38.55]Is that why you were getting, like, the smite vibes?
[113:40.61]I feel like I'm playing Artemis and smite.
[113:43.27]There's still enemies.
[113:44.01]Alright, cool.
[113:44.69]Alright, I say we go for it.
[113:46.19]Yeah, let's go.
[113:46.87]You're not fucking doing this.
[113:48.44]I just did the thing.
[113:49.06]Alright.
[113:49.80]Three, two, one, open.
[113:54.80]Be the queen.
[113:57.00]May as well stand in the bubble here.
[114:05.66]Whoops.
[114:07.30]Oh, that's okay.
[114:08.06]That's the first time I pushed that button.
[114:14.16]Watch out for the poison in the ground.
[114:28.26]I can't click it fast enough.
[114:29.26]I need to be way close.
[114:30.08]Oh, it did it anyway.
[114:30.94]That worked.
[114:31.56]Nice.
[114:32.02]I'm just trying to help out with the ads so we don't get overwhelmed too early.
[114:35.65]I leveled up right next to the boss, which is kind of scary because she does like a AOE really close, but I have the war banner down.
[114:46.75]There's a bunch of people behind us.
[114:48.40]Be careful.
[114:58.22]Oops.
[115:00.18]Forget that I have a teleport.
[115:06.65]Alright, clean it up.
[115:10.19]Sick.
[115:14.81]Alright.
[115:16.05]And then for the loot.
[115:20.80]Which I don't see.
[115:22.10]Is there no loot on the ground?
[115:24.20]I got a lunar coin.
[115:27.08]Where'd that come from?
[115:30.55]Alright.
[115:32.93]Okay, I see, I got, there's an onion and there's a VR headset.
[115:38.01]I'll just, you want the rare one or you want the... Let's go.
[115:44.02]It's a beetle guard.
[115:44.86]Alright.
[115:45.44]It's the beetle guard.
[115:46.56]Boxes, any boxes left that we didn't get before you keep going?
[115:50.04]I definitely have money.
[115:51.23]Yeah, just move.
[115:58.10]I think we just gotta go.
[115:59.14]We're still uneasy.
[115:59.96]Just rifle through.
[116:01.06]Oh, yeah, just activate it.
[116:04.69]We don't get time.
[116:05.19]Oh, what?
[116:05.45]Teleporter?
[116:06.17]Yeah, we don't get time.
[116:07.01]I just found, like, four boxes.
[116:12.69]You would have made me miss out on so much loot.
[116:15.31]Well, we gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.
[116:21.75]Okay.
[116:22.35]Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
[116:23.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[116:24.79]So, let me understand this.
[116:28.09]When we go in this teleporter, it's going to just go to medium automatically.
[116:34.74]That sounds right.
[116:36.30]So we have as much time as we want.
[116:38.58]No, people are saying no.
[116:39.96]Yes.
[116:41.66]No, yes.
[116:42.28]The duality of chat.
[116:43.54]No, I think so.
[116:44.26]No, yes, no.
[116:45.66]Well, let's just go.
[116:48.03]Okay.
[116:49.21]I'm ready.
[116:49.59]Look at the bar.
[116:50.59]Press it.
[116:51.21]Yeah.
[116:52.17]Well, hold on.
[116:53.13]You're the one down there.
[116:55.59]Oh, well, I thought you were... Sorry.
[116:58.21]Alright, so let's see what happens.
[117:00.73]We're halfway through easy right now.
[117:02.21]We're halfway through easy.
[117:03.69]We're porting on out.
[117:06.83]I think it just goes up, yeah, it just goes up some.
[117:09.11]Okay, so it goes up like almost a full one of those pieces of bubblegum.
[117:15.85]Band-aid.
[117:17.09]It just goes up a tick.
[117:19.83]It goes up a full band-aid.
[117:21.29]Have we done this yet?
[117:24.70]This looks new.
[117:25.38]Maybe it's because we actually beat the game on the other thing and we get a new rotation in.
[117:31.75]Like a nice desert map.
[117:33.41]It goes up by one of those quadrants.
[117:35.97]Quadrants means four.
[117:37.89]Sorry.
[117:39.05]It goes up by a basketball period.
[117:43.46]Exactly.
[117:44.28]Oh, that's what that does.
[117:54.20]I have, like, um, the queen bee, but evil.
[117:58.98]Like, you're a friend, but bad.
[118:00.96]But mean.
[118:03.34]It's you, but stronger.
[118:05.18]Okay, I'm seeing... Ooh, been shot.
[118:14.09]Also known as a third.
[118:15.59]Yeah, it is broken up into thirds.
[118:17.77]Yes.
[118:20.55]I was gaming, though.
[118:21.31]I couldn't talk about it.
[118:24.56]More damage to healthy enemies.
[118:25.78]That's a freezer.
[118:40.63]$151 for these robots.
[118:44.62]Give me some more boxes.
[118:46.92]Seems pretty sparse out here.
[118:48.84]Yeah, it does.
[118:49.36]Um...
[118:54.54]I'll take some health.
[118:55.16]There's one of those shrines over here.
[118:58.11]Alright, I got 145 bucks.
[119:09.77]Right here.
[119:10.41]125 dollars.
[119:10.85]Come on.
[119:11.81]That'd be good.
[119:12.44]It is.
[119:12.98]Wow, what is this thing?
[119:17.96]Is that bad?
[119:23.81]Alright, that's kind of weird, because killing an enemy, like, pulls out my FOV.
[119:28.90]Uh, what's your special?
[119:32.10]I get, like, a frost aura when I kill something.
[119:37.83]This actually is pretty awesome.
[119:40.93]Alright, good.
[119:42.23]Good pickup.
[119:42.69]Alright, we should probably get started here.
[119:47.03]I've got, like, one box since we got here.
[119:48.75]Oh, okay, well...
[119:51.51]I found a shrine of combat if you want to come over here.
[119:54.29]Oh, yeah.
[119:55.19]Let me just grab this one box and I will join you shortly.
[119:59.09]This is now in a box.
[120:00.37]I already picked that up.
[120:01.55]Alright, I'm coming.
[120:02.11]I'm getting melee.
[120:08.78]That's pretty awesome.
[120:12.18]Extra damage to bosses.
[120:13.50]Nice.
[120:16.70]What is this thing?
[120:18.39]There's two shrines of combat here, I think.
[120:20.19]Okay, there's a shrine of the mountain right there.
[120:23.05]Oh, boy.
[120:24.16]Do we dare do that?
[120:27.32]Maybe.
[120:28.58]Should we go for it?
[120:31.02]Maybe.
[120:31.36]Alright, let's turn it on.
[120:32.90]I'm going to activate it.
[120:38.83]Alright, the boss is going to be harder.
[120:40.73]Invited challenge to the mountain.
[120:42.87]Alright, come to me.
[120:45.21]Come on.
[120:49.42]We're still in early game, so it's not that big of a deal, apparently.
[120:51.73]So, should be good.
[120:52.99]Whatever.
[120:53.31]They're just trying to take away from our accomplishments, future or past.
[120:57.57]No, they're trying to help.
[120:59.87]Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.
[121:00.97]Okay.
[121:03.19]I do that all the time on super hard mode, okay?
[121:06.38]I have 120 hours in this game already.
[121:10.20]120?
[121:12.28]I got a lot of money.
[121:13.04]I need something to spend this on.
[121:16.58]You gonna activate this?
[121:18.02]Might as well.
[121:18.51]I'm here.
[121:28.06]Is that the thing?
[121:28.92]Is that the challenge cube?
[121:30.44]I don't know.
[121:32.66]Guy, I guess.
[121:36.62]Did we just get, like, a bunch of money?
[121:38.52]I think so.
[121:39.24]I mean, there's more stuff here.
[121:43.10]That's yours.
[121:44.00]That one's your guy.
[121:44.76]There's another challenge cube, though.
[121:47.56]Press it?
[121:48.01]Over here.
[121:48.63]I guess.
[121:52.51]All these boxes are open.
[121:53.79]Alright, that spawned... Yeah, who did that?
[121:55.41]Okay, that spawned this guy.
[121:56.53]These guys here.
[122:00.27]Oh, lag.
[122:02.01]Yeah, I got the lag too.
[122:07.14]We just get a bunch of money for this.
[122:08.38]Alright, we should probably do the teleporter now.
[122:17.26]Uh, yeah.
[122:18.32]We got a lot of money.
[122:23.87]Where are we going to spend it all?
[122:25.13]I don't know.
[122:26.09]I don't see any more boxes.
[122:28.93]Rock music?
[122:29.49]Just gonna have to convert.
[122:32.57]I don't see anything.
[122:33.17]Um, do I want to go really fast?
[122:37.49]Teleporter's this way.
[122:38.25]Wait, he doesn't know?
[122:45.92]What do you mean?
[122:47.26]Wait, what?
[122:48.06]He knows.
[122:48.32]What do you mean?
[122:49.50]He doesn't know.
[122:50.82]Should we tell him, chat?
[122:52.38]Should we?
[122:56.22]Alright, there's a ton of boxes over here by the teleporter.
[123:03.87]Or one.
[123:04.57]Sorry, I meant to say one box.
[123:06.79]I thought there was more.
[123:08.73]You ready?
[123:09.65]Three, two... As ready as we're probably ever going to be.
[123:11.69]This is hard boss mode.
[123:17.93]Oh, boy.
[123:22.47]Yep, there's multiple robots.
[123:24.25]Just try to focus on the big one in the middle here.
[123:34.33]That's a bunch of robots.
[123:36.89]Yes, there are.
[123:38.15]Oi!
[123:38.81]No!
[123:39.95]Where'd I end up?
[123:40.49]What just happened?
[123:42.93]Oh, fuck.
[123:43.67]Okay.
[123:45.73]Alright, I keep, like, falling off the fucking edge.
[123:50.44]Oh, this is bad.
[123:53.02]This is real bad.
[123:56.16]What is even hitting me from behind?
[124:02.26]Oh, that edge?
[124:03.04]Oh, this is bad.
[124:03.94]Oh, we're dead.
[124:05.40]Game over.
[124:07.13]Oh, you're dead.
[124:07.95]Oh, yeah, I got destroyed.
[124:08.75]Yeah, it's not good.
[124:17.19]Good luck.
[124:19.07]Thanks.
[124:20.19]Shrine of the Mountain sometimes makes an elite boss, too.
[124:25.58]It adds a boss.
[124:26.38]Okay, so Shrine of the Mountain adds a boss to the level, and the boss can be elite.
[124:31.30]Oh, boy.
[124:34.86]I forget that teleport only goes forward, and I'm used to dodge rolling backward.
[124:38.38]Are there three?
[124:40.94]No, there's only two.
[124:52.51]Help me.
[124:53.63]I don't wanna go back into that.
[124:55.25]There are three.
[125:00.87]They're standing inside of my fun zone.
[125:03.33]Wait, so we got two by default and then one extra or one by default and then two extra?
[125:08.65]Alright.
[125:09.27]Goodbye.
[125:09.83]Good night.
[125:17.98]Yeah, we got two extra bosses, by the way, if you're curious.
[125:25.30]I need to get in there.
[125:26.50]Oh, no, it's two by default.
[125:32.21]Oooooh!
[125:33.69]11, 14, 15 health.
[125:34.37]Aww.
[125:34.59]Very sad.
[125:35.36]You made a solid attempt.
[125:38.64]That was a solid one.
[125:39.28]Very sad.
[125:42.86]I had the frost aura too.
[125:55.17]Later on you can get like nine bosses at once with three shrines.
[125:58.69]Wow.
[126:04.73]ridiculous well that was uh certainly a challenge uh they were just trying to help clear the level for me too yeah later on you can get nine bosses with like three shrines you can spawn nine of those things I guess we need to go oh we do we do we do we do uh thank you so great canadian fuck club 10 community subs thank you thank you so much

[126:43.19]Thank you, Italic.
[126:43.82]That was me.
[126:46.48]That's been you the whole time.
[126:48.54]Yeah, I'm anonymous.
[126:51.08]I don't believe that.
[126:58.18]Dropping subs.
[127:01.98]Hold on, let me... I gotta get there.
[127:03.94]I played good for a minute.
[127:04.74]I need to do something.
[127:06.24]Play good.
[127:07.34]Okay.
[127:07.88]I can steal all the boxes.
[127:10.20]But no, thank you for real.
[127:11.23]That's a lot.
[127:11.93]I'm just going to set up a key line so I can mute.
[127:16.57]So I don't talk over.
[127:18.81]Why can I not set this right here?
[127:25.60]Oh, god damn it.
[127:26.22]Whatever.
[127:28.30]He's muted too.
[127:28.90]Alright.
[127:37.62]Okay, that's another one I haven't seen.
[127:39.02]Move faster.
[127:41.86]Just in general, not even while sprinting, just a generalized move faster, huh?
[127:45.40]Yeah, I just... I have like a cast on.
[127:56.49]I love double jump.
[127:57.65]That's probably one of my favorite ones.
[127:59.69]What is that?
[128:00.33]Healing drone?
[128:01.47]I want that.
[128:01.85]Come on, give me like another two dollars, three dollars.
[128:06.46]Yeah, the right click is crazy strong on the Huntress.
[128:09.42]Yeah, it bounces around, too.
[128:10.33]It's really good.
[128:13.99]You can stack ten of those and have speed hacks.
[128:15.99]That's insane.
[128:18.31]That's the best item in the entire game.
[128:21.33]If you get, like, three or four of them.
[128:26.28]We got something down here.
[128:33.51]Lots of boxes.
[128:34.57]Lots of boxes over here.
[128:36.37]Three boxes over here.
[128:38.88]It's okay.
[128:39.26]What happens if you fall?
[128:40.18]Because it makes me feel like I'm going to insta-die.
[128:42.18]It teleports you back and you lose health.
[128:44.60]Okay.
[128:45.20]So it's just like a slight health lose.
[128:47.40]That's good.
[128:50.12]Found the porter.
[128:51.50]Did you find it?
[128:53.90]There's a couple boxes over here.
[128:55.34]In case we want to pop it, I'm out of money, so I would say I'm ready.
[129:02.64]You ready?
[129:02.90]I'll look at all this shit.
[129:03.70]I mean, I'm as ready as I'm gonna be, I think.
[129:05.60]I need more money, but... There's a health, hurt yourself thing here.
[129:09.27]There's a health, hurt yourself.
[129:11.13]For money thing.
[129:12.31]There's a hurt yourself for money thing over here.
[129:16.55]Um... I think that's like a different part of Vegas.
[129:20.21]What?
[129:24.01]Alright, just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[129:27.61]He's volleying over here.
[129:28.64]Where the hell did you guys come from?
[129:35.42]There's the boss.
[129:37.74]We don't leave this place yet.
[129:40.68]There's about four boxes over here we can open, but this is all said and done.
[129:48.59]Don't leave.
[129:50.95]Oh, don't worry.
[129:51.95]I'm not going anywhere.
[129:53.33]Good.
[130:03.50]That hurt.
[130:07.83]Anybody behind me?
[130:08.41]Yeah, there is.
[130:08.87]Always check behind you.
[130:10.95]I don't know if the arrows can actually hit airborne enemies like that, but I'll try anyways.
[130:15.89]Oh god, it's coming to get me.
[130:22.06]Is there damage falloff from far away?
[130:24.40]There is.
[130:24.96]Ah, good question.
[130:25.86]Yeah, there is.
[130:28.24]Definitely.
[130:29.44]What the fuck just, what happened?
[130:31.64]Um, I believe we stayed too close to the jellyfish.
[130:35.17]What happened?
[130:35.57]And, uh, got exploded.
[130:37.07]What happened?
[130:38.07]Because it does like a charge up ability where you have to get out of the circle.
[130:42.81]We, I thought, I mean, I was standing on like a cliff.
[130:46.09]And we both were inside of its area of influence.
[130:49.79]Holy shit.
[130:52.17]Well, that was too bad.
[130:53.55]That would, there was a lot of items there too.
[130:56.34]I'd rather die like then and it's kind of like dying first floor just get it over with rip the band-aid off and just do it again better stand behind so I didn't even know he it was coming at me okay well that was weird so just line of sight when he does that look away for two seconds dying on level one I'm sorry
[131:25.40]Just look away for two more seconds and you wouldn't have known that we died.
[131:28.98]What if you turn around and look the other way?
[131:31.80]Is it based on your sight?
[131:35.24]What if you just don't look at him?
[131:38.32]If he's not on the screen, he's not real.
[131:43.69]That's true.
[131:45.13]Occlusion.
[131:45.53]I think that's how game occlusion works.
[131:50.67]If you don't look at him, he's not loaded in, so he's not affecting your frame rate, and thus cannot hit you.
[131:56.60]Okay, get a couple of these capsules.
[132:04.55]What the hell is it?
[132:05.79]Who?
[132:06.75]Oh, these things.
[132:11.44]Active ability over here.
[132:16.91]Mm-hmm.
[132:18.93]Gain 100.
[132:19.25]There it is.
[132:19.87]That's the thing you've been getting.
[132:22.15]Uh-oh.
[132:22.53]I almost died.
[132:23.11]That would have been very embarrassing.
[132:25.67]Teleport is over here.
[132:26.33]Uh-oh.
[132:32.11]Oh, sorry.
[132:32.93]I hit the DPI button on my Razor Return at Death Adder.
[132:39.19]Why do mice even have DPI buttons?
[132:43.33]It's just a gimmick.
[132:44.37]Nobody actually uses them.
[132:50.10]I got teleported.
[132:50.84]You want to just give this a go?
[132:51.94]Or you want to try to look for more items?
[132:54.32]Uh, yeah, whenever's fine.
[132:55.36]Let's do it.
[132:59.06]You have to kind of go through a cave to get here.
[133:00.54]I need one penny.
[133:06.19]One penny?
[133:07.33]I got it.
[133:11.99]Uh, where's the teleport?
[133:13.17]Uh, through the cave over here.
[133:18.88]Any more items to get before we go?
[133:20.60]Uh, not that I can see.
[133:25.14]Did you select them all?
[133:27.63]I may have selected them all, but all of them is, like, one of them.
[133:31.19]Yeah, there's an active ability one down there.
[133:33.55]Nah, let's just go.
[133:40.20]Where is it?
[133:42.08]Is that still there?
[133:43.54]Got, like, caught on the teleporter.
[133:46.22]Oh, it's the jellyfish again, but he's in an even more difficult area.
[133:49.34]Well, just, like, stay in the cave.
[133:51.74]Oh, no, that's probably a bad idea.
[133:53.48]Yeah, it's a bad idea.
[133:54.98]Uh, what if he does that in the cave?
[134:00.57]My god, yeah, we're gonna, like, just get eaten alive in this cave.
[134:03.15]I'm just gonna, if I see him charging, he's doing it!
[134:05.33]What?!
[134:05.53]Okay, he's fine.
[134:14.09]We have a giant cylinder, right?
[134:16.95]We have a giant, like, pillar to hide behind.
[134:19.21]We do, but I'm not... I don't trust it to actually block.
[134:23.11]Why not?
[134:23.69]I feel like the damage is just gonna go through.
[134:26.63]Well, that's... Everyone in chat said that's how you... You just line of sight it.
[134:38.20]Here it comes.
[134:41.45]Well, yeah, it's like infinity distance, so it is line of sight.
[134:44.83]What is fucking killing me?
[134:46.71]What is killing me?
[134:51.51]Was I like burning?
[134:52.57]That guy was just burning me?
[134:56.73]Okay, that guy was just burning me.
[134:58.95]Yeah, I think you were just on fire.
[135:02.85]This is the worst area for that enemy.
[135:05.07]That guy was worse than the boss.
[135:06.43]Okay, he's dead.
[135:09.49]Uh, these items are the same.
[135:14.09]Dealing damage heals you.
[135:15.27]That may be the best thing I've seen all day.
[135:16.97]That's pretty good.
[135:17.81]Alright.
[135:20.46]Ready?
[135:21.16]Oh, we have to charge this stuff.
[135:22.66]Uh, do we have any items that we can get, or do we just go?
[135:25.30]I don't think there's any items.
[135:26.18]I think we just go.
[135:26.94]I didn't see any leftover boxes.
[135:28.70]Unless there was that... Did you get the active item one?
[135:30.96]Yeah, I did.
[135:32.16]Okay.
[135:32.58]Well, then I'll say let's go.
[135:34.66]I got the crit one.
[135:39.72]What is killing me?
[135:44.97]Gamers, I need help.
[135:46.97]What is killing me?
[135:50.85]Leech is really good with commando.
[135:52.01]Yeah, it is.
[135:52.91]Lots of potential hits.
[135:54.37]Alright, let's speed it up.
[136:04.39]Saving money in Risk of Rain.
[136:07.44]I'm not saving money.
[136:09.44]I'm trying to just get as much as I possibly can.
[136:13.36]And I'm just going to abuse this, right?
[136:15.80]Because I heal on hits.
[136:17.99]So why not just abuse it?
[136:19.05]Oh, that's a good idea.
[136:20.47]Right?
[136:22.93]Well, you can only abuse it so much.
[136:24.47]I'll also take 75.
[136:26.89]And now you have to do 93.
[136:28.99]So good luck.
[136:29.66]Okay.
[136:33.74]Why can't I do it?
[136:35.75]Do I have to have the health?
[136:37.15]Yeah, you have to have it to give it up first.
[136:41.69]Okay, apparently still don't have it.
[136:45.13]Okay, if I get hit once, I'm fucking dead.
[136:50.11]That's dangerous.
[136:51.27]I don't like this thing.
[136:52.79]I got a lot of fucking money.
[136:56.82]Yeah, I don't like that.
[136:57.98]That feels weird.
[137:01.44]I have enough to get a bunch of items, though.
[137:04.73]More damage to bosses.
[137:07.47]Yeah, I'm like heal boy right now.
[137:09.81]There we go.
[137:10.85]Okay, I'm fine.
[137:16.94]The trade is 100% health next.
[137:18.94]Why would you even do that?
[137:22.40]For the Lord!
[137:27.15]Be so funny!
[137:30.13]Maybe if you have a thing that brings you back to life?
[137:32.45]Yeah, I guess so.
[137:38.96]I find there's a bunch of them over here.
[137:40.64]If you feel like doing 75% money, they're over here.
[137:44.78]We have the leech ability, so it's not stupid.
[137:49.38]Yeah, and I have health orbs on kill.
[137:51.53]I need to spend this money, though, first.
[137:57.17]First and foremost.
[137:59.81]75 is not bad, no.
[138:01.43]93, though, is a little scary.
[138:06.64]Bosses to damage.
[138:07.86]Yeah, okay good Choice on this one get a lot of items so many there's a lot of boxes on this Healthy enemies is this gasoline was this one?
[138:22.05]There's a ton increases attack speed I Have super shield did it decrease it doesn't feel like I increase very much attack speed here.
[138:31.05]Oh
[138:36.07]More over here.
[138:36.81]This shrine's this way, too.
[138:40.60]This is a... Okay, what is this duplicate?
[138:42.14]I could have infinity banners if I wanted to.
[138:45.02]I didn't get anything.
[138:46.32]I think one banner would be fine.
[138:53.61]Okay, cool.
[138:54.83]I found the teleporter.
[138:56.39]I mean, you probably already saw it, but there it is.
[139:05.42]I dropped the banner right on top of the teleporter conveniently, so... I don't get a bad build.
[139:11.82]Yeah, I'm feeling okay.
[139:13.02]I don't really do a lot of damage, but I have a lot of survivability.
[139:15.96]117 bucks.
[139:19.42]Alright, maybe we should ping where you are right now.
[139:24.81]I pinged the porter.
[139:25.63]Oh, you got it.
[139:26.05]Alright, good.
[139:26.79]Yeah, so it should be highlighted.
[139:29.15]I've got a bunch of money.
[139:29.89]I don't have anything to spend it on.
[139:30.89]There's a few boxes back here, but...
[139:34.18]We probably should just get going.
[139:35.42]Uh, we're not even halfway to medium, so it's not the worst.
[139:43.17]Too many elites over here.
[139:44.43]Okay, what was that?
[139:45.61]Nice.
[139:45.89]So you said there's boxes by you?
[139:47.07]Uh, there is one... Yeah, there's like two.
[139:51.24]Oh, I see it.
[139:51.76]I see at least one.
[139:52.58]There's a chance thing over there.
[139:57.60]This is addicting.
[140:01.67]It is addicting, yeah.
[140:03.01]What's that?
[140:03.39]You just want to make your character, like, super-powered.
[140:06.32]Detonate enemies on hill.
[140:08.04]And see how strong they can get.
[140:12.42]And move out of combat fast.
[140:14.10]Move fast out of combat.
[140:16.02]Help me out, chat.
[140:16.66]If you pick up two drop orb of health and they stack, is it a super orb for each enemy or two small orbs from each enemy?
[140:28.25]Looks like one super orb.
[140:31.66]What is this?
[140:32.16]What is this shrine?
[140:32.92]Uh, the shrine?
[140:36.21]Okay, so it's a chance shrine?
[140:38.47]You can do it.
[140:39.91]It's $470.
[140:40.51]$470.
[140:40.57]I'm about to spend all my money on whatever this is.
[140:43.79]$470, dude.
[140:44.55]A gold orb appears.
[140:46.83]A gold orb appears.
[140:48.69]What does that mean?
[140:49.95]I don't know.
[140:51.69]Are they all of... There's a bunch of beetles over here.
[140:54.15]Gold orb?
[140:58.67]Go through the portal.
[140:59.79]I don't see a portal.
[141:02.24]Portal?
[141:03.20]Gold orb portal?
[141:05.87]Where?
[141:07.71]I don't know.
[141:13.45]Apparently there's a golden orb somewhere?
[141:15.31]Portal shows up when you kill the boss.
[141:17.25]Okay, let's go kill the boss.
[141:18.23]Alright, let's go do it.
[141:23.93]We're already at medium, so this is gonna be a challenge.
[141:26.17]It's alright.
[141:26.57]If we die, everyone's gonna be pissed.
[141:28.53]Well, it's okay.
[141:32.19]Because people are like, I've never seen a gold orb before.
[141:34.67]Here we go.
[141:37.75]Activate.
[141:39.41]Who is it?
[141:40.27]Stone Titan.
[141:41.05]I don't think we've seen this yet.
[141:41.85]Stone Titan.
[141:42.85]I think it's the big stony guys.
[141:44.51]Just a bunch of them.
[141:46.33]Where the hell are they?
[141:47.99]Up there?
[141:48.33]Okay.
[141:49.15]I'm dying already.
[141:58.21]Whoa!
[142:00.57]Okay, hold on a second.
[142:01.29]What the fuck?
[142:02.57]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[142:08.67]Oh, I'm- I'm- I'm dying.
[142:10.33]I'm dead.
[142:11.73]Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?
[142:13.37]I didn't even see the stone titan.
[142:15.45]He's like- I got shredded.
[142:16.71]I don't even know, he's like up top.
[142:21.84]Fire elites, they suck.
[142:29.10]Jesus.
[142:31.29]Yeah, I don't think you've seen the people that killed me yet.
[142:33.78]You're kinda out here.
[142:35.18]Yeah, this is bad.
[142:35.88]I can't really go anywhere.
[142:37.20]I need to, like, wrap around.
[142:51.39]Okay, hold on.
[142:55.85]Safety.
[143:04.42]Where are they?
[143:10.88]Oh my god, will you leave me?
[143:15.44]I had to do it.
[143:20.33]I do a lot of damage to bosses.
[143:21.55]I just don't want to go in there with like...
[143:35.99]Okay, he's over there.
[143:38.81]Is he the... He's launching, like, volleys or something?
[143:43.83]Dude, he's... Okay, he's... He's... I... I... He's... He's... There he is.
[143:59.48]Okay, hold on.
[144:00.48]I might be alright here.
[144:09.28]You might be alright here, except enemies are still spawning in, and you're almost to heart.
[144:12.32]Yeah, I know.
[144:14.99]Oh, no, never mind.
[144:16.03]I'm probably dead.
[144:18.37]And then there's that guy.
[144:19.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[144:21.43]Here come the other friends.
[144:22.45]No, no.
[144:23.07]Oh.
[144:27.66]It's cool that I can see your cooldowns.
[144:32.06]No, I can't.
[144:32.72]I can see you're active, but I can't see your ability cooldowns.
[144:35.88]Eh.
[144:37.37]Eh.
[144:39.98]Jeez!
[144:42.28]Okay, hold on.
[144:42.80]If I can just farm somebody for health for a moment.
[144:54.90]Look at all these fucking people coming over here.
[144:57.20]This is bad.
[145:06.54]It's these fire elites.
[145:14.52]Alright, I'm doing okay.
[145:15.90]We're almost in hard, though.
[145:16.88]I almost have a chance it's not.
[145:18.91]I'm gonna stop the spawn.
[145:22.19]The spawn is what's killing us.
[145:23.37]He's up there, but you know what?
[145:24.87]Forget it.
[145:28.49]I'm really surprised you're still alive.
[145:30.25]Use that, uh, war banner.
[145:32.34]Yeah, I'm just trying to dodge around it.
[145:33.96]99%, alright.
[145:38.34]Super shot speed.
[145:39.76]Done.
[145:42.06]He's doing it.
[145:44.63]Okay.
[145:54.18]Just snipe him from back here.
[145:55.36]Fuck it.
[146:02.53]Well, easy.
[146:03.09]Don't be... I'm just getting, like, cocky there.
[146:04.69]That was pretty dumb.
[146:05.39]I don't like that underwater thing.
[146:11.69]Like, I can't see when I aim up.
[146:14.07]Yeah.
[146:15.37]I hope that they, like, make it so that the camera bounces on the surface of the water or something.
[146:19.41]Yeah, look at it.
[146:19.95]I can't even see what the hell I'm doing.
[146:24.39]It's strategic.
[146:28.31]You gotta think about your placement.
[146:34.92]Alright, I'll get this.
[146:36.74]We're gonna be at a very hard... He can't get down to you.
[146:39.10]He can't shoot you.
[146:40.22]No, he's... You gotta stand perfectly still.
[146:44.38]and spam.
[146:48.52]Although I don't know when he's doing his telegraph move because I'm under the water.
[146:51.38]So do I get to go through the gold portal if I'm dead?
[146:54.96]Or do I have to watch you do the gold portal?
[146:59.92]I guess we're going to find out.
[147:01.10]Go ahead.
[147:02.32]No, I'm dead.
[147:06.61]Dealing damage heals you.
[147:07.93]Again.
[147:08.59]Twice.
[147:09.71]Wow.
[147:10.75]Uh... Let's do this.
[147:13.05]Go ahead.
[147:13.45]Is this gonna... Go through.
[147:15.82]It's gonna... Proceed through the tele... What?
[147:20.24]I just pressed it.
[147:21.58]How do you activate this?
[147:22.70]It said E, enter portal.
[147:24.22]Oh, you're going in.
[147:24.78]It's probably loading.
[147:27.64]Do you come back?
[147:29.12]Are you alive?
[147:29.75]Yeah, I'm alive.
[147:30.63]What?
[147:33.15]Hidden realm.
[147:33.85]Gilded coast.
[147:34.77]At least I get to see it.
[147:40.71]Alright.
[147:43.23]Just like that.
[147:43.93]Here we go.
[147:44.79]Oh my god.
[147:51.47]Rebuild the Halicon.
[147:54.45]Seven beacons we have to touch, apparently.
[147:56.75]Oh, really?
[147:57.45]I guess.
[147:57.87]Yeah, look at the top right.
[148:01.17]Rebuild the beacons.
[148:02.95]For money.
[148:03.93]Oh, it's money!
[148:05.67]It's money.
[148:07.78]Oh, I see.
[148:12.33]Basically can never stop sprinting as Huntress.
[148:18.90]That was pretty sick.
[148:28.91]Healbot finally caught up to me.
[148:30.21]Nice.
[148:32.77]Are there iframes on the dodge?
[148:33.93]Probably not.
[148:34.41]I don't know why the hell I didn't ask that.
[148:35.89]Alright, I got one.
[148:41.93]I'm helping.
[148:42.41]Okay.
[148:43.79]I got 388 bucks.
[148:44.75]What do they look like?
[148:45.65]Uh, they're like little staffs.
[148:49.11]Like little staves in the ground.
[148:50.93]I got two out of seven.
[148:53.29]I'm a lunar coin.
[148:54.19]Do I get to keep that through death?
[148:57.35]Yes, you do.
[148:58.68]Oh, nice.
[148:59.12]You get to keep it forever.
[149:02.98]Oh, man.
[149:03.40]That hurt.
[149:03.72]Uh, I got another staff over here.
[149:10.37]Going for it.
[149:11.51]Was it 270?
[149:12.27]2300?
[149:12.29]Yeah, the purple in the top left.
[149:14.55]Oh, nice.
[149:14.91]278.
[149:14.93]278.
[149:16.47]Okay, there's three.
[149:31.08]I'm just going to go along the outskirts and just activate them.
[149:42.21]Can we fall?
[149:44.77]I think you just fall down there.
[149:58.99]Alright, I got another one.
[150:00.57]We got four out of seven.
[150:01.51]Why do we have a boss that's just spawned?
[150:03.36]He's immune to everything.
[150:04.40]Really?
[150:05.64]Immune, immune, immune.
[150:06.52]We have to turn off all these things, I think, to be able to kill him.
[150:15.03]297.
[150:15.44]Alright, I'm going to activate this one.
[150:17.58]Alright, I'm activating this one.
[150:19.30]5, 7, you got it.
[150:20.18]We need 1.
[150:20.86]Okay, easy.
[150:21.56]We need... Where is it?
[150:23.74]It's definitely on the outskirts somewhere.
[150:32.13]Oh, he's immune.
[150:32.67]Oh yeah, I see.
[150:34.05]There's boxes down here too.
[150:36.93]Maybe we should not activate this yet.
[150:42.89]Nice.
[150:43.43]Move faster.
[150:44.05]That's what I need right there.
[150:45.21]Okay.
[150:46.17]I'm moving.
[150:46.93]I'm running.
[150:47.71]He's too close to me.
[150:48.45]I don't like this.
[150:50.07]I'm out of combat, right?
[150:50.87]I should be going faster.
[150:51.43]Where is the last staff?
[150:53.67]I don't know.
[150:55.57]Oh, here it is.
[150:55.95]I don't have enough money, but it's right there.
[150:58.27]How much money do you have?
[150:58.94]139.
[150:58.96]What is it?
[150:59.22]270, right?
[150:59.36]Yeah, it's like 270.
[151:12.50]Okay, I almost have enough.
[151:16.16]Oh no, the rock just fucking, no, that's gonna do a lot of damage to me.
[151:19.23]Hold on, I'm gonna do it.
[151:20.05]Oh, come on.
[151:20.99]I'm gonna do it.
[151:22.07]Stupid rock.
[151:23.29]I need one penny.
[151:28.51]I did it.
[151:28.83]Alright, defeat the boss.
[151:31.98]We're doing it.
[151:36.44]Oh God, oh God.
[151:46.18]Oh, there's like a giant dinosaur chasing behind me, that's why.
[151:48.78]I was like, what the hell is hurting me?
[151:56.07]He's like just too far away from my little gold thing to matter.
[151:58.77]That underwater shit is gonna drive me crazy.
[152:01.25]I'm dead.
[152:03.19]Uh-oh.
[152:09.28]The like crosshair sink underwater thing.
[152:26.16]That thing just fucked me up bad I don't even know what killed me Oh just spawning more
[152:55.23]You need an insane build to handle this area, huh?
[152:58.23]Well, that's... It seems kind of manageable.
[153:01.59]He's immune again?
[153:02.83]Rebuild the beacons?
[153:04.47]Oh my god, just kill me.
[153:07.07]That's a joke.
[153:09.06]Never mind.
[153:09.76]That's manageable.
[153:15.20]Apparently you missed a coin.
[153:17.36]Whatever.
[153:20.90]You go get the coin, chat.
[153:24.97]Alright, give me one second.
[153:25.81]I need to change this.
[153:32.21]You want to get the coin $19.99 on Steam.
[153:34.66]Okay, key blind.
[153:43.00]I'm this guy.
[153:44.40]You can be this guy too if you can.
[153:45.61]Let me test and see if that works.
[153:49.67]I don't know who this guy is though.
[153:50.77]Okay, ready?
[153:51.77]Ready?
[153:52.37]Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
[153:54.69]Alright.
[153:55.93]Just making sure I can mute.
[153:58.95]Um, we haven't done this yet?
[154:03.07]I'm surprised we haven't done the, uh, did the first level three times thing, or five times.
[154:08.32]I don't know.
[154:08.66]I got this guy.
[154:09.94]Oh, you do have that guy.
[154:11.68]How come we both don't have it?
[154:14.50]Um, I think I know why.
[154:16.20]What happened?
[154:17.55]Because I cheated.
[154:18.69]You cheated?
[154:19.31]Yeah.
[154:21.53]When I first got the game, I had never played Risk of Rain, so I did only the first area to see if I wanted to stream it.
[154:27.55]Oh, okay.
[154:28.01]So I'm one ahead of you.
[154:29.05]I see.
[154:30.39]I got cheated.
[154:35.33]You got cheated.
[154:36.25]I didn't even read this guy's abilities.
[154:39.05]Oh, shit.
[154:41.40]That was kind of my fault, though.
[154:43.70]Alright.
[154:44.86]That was fun.
[154:50.75]23 bucks for the chance.
[155:01.24]What do you got?
[155:02.96]Looks like there's some decent boxes down here.
[155:09.94]Can't have been the freezer.
[155:14.74]Alright.
[155:15.90]27.
[155:15.92]That was all that was in those two.
[155:17.32]This guy's crazy.
[155:21.76]Yeah, good.
[155:23.28]And by crazy, I mean, I don't know how.
[155:24.90]What do you mean?
[155:28.02]Thanks, Shrine of Chance.
[155:29.06]I love you.
[155:31.68]Like, his movement is... Is it a good character?
[155:37.92]He's got wheels.
[155:40.83]And he dropped bombs and stuff.
[155:42.67]Move faster out of combat.
[155:43.91]I need more damage moves.
[155:48.07]That's my alternate fire.
[155:50.65]And then that's throwing the Wii bombs.
[155:56.37]Rolling in!
[155:57.63]So wait, you can use two?
[155:59.51]You're so cool.
[155:59.95]You look like Rob.
[156:00.63]I do look like Rob.
[156:04.77]Apparently you can hold two active items.
[156:08.26]Really?
[156:09.24]I might just be making that up.
[156:10.78]Is that true?
[156:13.04]I'm currently injecting myself with attack speed, which is the, of course, thing that this character needs.
[156:20.16]Spray and pray.
[156:21.44]You can.
[156:21.84]That's cool.
[156:22.16]Do you have, like, grenades?
[156:24.26]What, do you throw, like, canisters out?
[156:25.96]Oh, that's insane.
[156:30.08]Uh, so I do this.
[156:32.37]Then I can do this.
[156:34.57]Same gun, but alternate fire.
[156:35.95]Watch out behind you.
[156:37.45]Whoops.
[156:42.71]Wow.
[156:42.99]It has piercing, too?
[156:44.41]But you have to go so slow.
[156:46.55]Oh.
[156:49.69]Stunning.
[156:53.07]What's the weakness?
[156:54.41]I feel like I'm so slow.
[156:55.89]You look pretty slow.
[156:57.85]You look like you're having... You look like your wheels don't move that fast.
[157:01.71]I also have a giant hitbox.
[157:09.24]I love how we're just kind of circling mindlessly around.
[157:11.90]Yeah, we probably should just like shooting these guys.
[157:18.62]Big hitbox.
[157:23.84]Okay, shield.
[157:25.42]It might be time to get this going.
[157:26.88]Yeah, it might be time.
[157:28.60]Where's the... Where is it, over there?
[157:33.88]I'm struggling here.
[157:34.48]Oh, that's a heal bot.
[157:35.14]Shit.
[157:35.80]I want that.
[157:36.18]Alright, I'm gonna come... Remind me to go get that.
[157:38.80]He jumped over me.
[157:41.39]There's two blots here.
[157:42.59]Do we know where the thing is yet?
[157:44.83]Not yet, but I definitely want to come back and get those.
[157:47.31]Oh, that's a problem.
[157:52.07]I assume you already went through here.
[157:54.15]I've wrapped this way.
[157:55.33]I think I can get one of them.
[157:57.97]Damn it.
[158:02.01]Did I miss it?
[158:02.95]I probably did.
[158:03.41]Yeah, it's like right in the middle.
[158:08.07]Alright, you got stuff?
[158:08.95]You ready?
[158:10.11]I am pretty much ready.
[158:13.49]Alright, it's a go.
[158:15.51]It's a go.
[158:20.19]I wanted to get one of those heal bots.
[158:26.13]stone titan there's quite a few little stone friends over here ow I could not dodge I go so slow buddy you can call me wall-e not buddy wall-e alright where are you stone titan
[158:50.17]Back here.
[158:51.19]He's behind the pillar.
[158:53.06]He's just hiding.
[158:53.76]He's just hiding.
[158:54.36]He's the line of sighting us.
[158:55.34]Oh, that's fine.
[158:57.55]Keep doing that.
[159:00.01]I think I remember reading that they're going to make the teleporter easier to see.
[159:03.79]Because even though chat probably can see it without any problem whatsoever, they're going to make it at least easier for streamers to see.
[159:11.31]I think that's one of the first patch notes.
[159:13.37]For streamers?
[159:15.95]Yeah, we've had some complaints that streamers can't see it.
[159:20.06]Streamers are having trouble seeing it.
[159:22.18]I'm stuck on top of these guys.
[159:29.28]This is the streamer update.
[159:34.02]I really do think they're changing that, though.
[159:35.54]That's fine.
[159:41.76]Because, like, Risk of Rain 1, you know, you just go left or right.
[159:44.68]It's either left or right.
[159:46.22]Up or down.
[159:48.22]Where's the Z-axis?
[159:49.40]Doesn't exist.
[159:56.69]Can't have money to get my healbot.
[160:00.65]Where the hell is my healing drone?
[160:08.83]There he is.
[160:17.18]Almost dead.
[160:17.88]I don't know when to use... Oh my god.
[160:20.50]Alright, good.
[160:24.43]When do you use snipe mode or when not to?
[160:26.75]Ukuleles!
[160:28.41]So what does that do?
[160:30.80]Does it electrify shots or something?
[160:32.94]I believe that the ukulele does a spreading zap move.
[160:42.34]Horned fruit.
[160:43.61]Heal.
[160:46.17]So it's just a heal.
[160:47.49]Cool.
[160:48.99]Probably pretty helpful.
[160:53.16]Yeah, it's a chain lightning.
[161:03.45]Okay, I want that other drone, and then we can get out of here.
[161:05.99]There's a box down there, too.
[161:09.51]I'll get that on the way back.
[161:17.63]Let's see...
[161:26.19]Wasn't it over here?
[161:29.77]I just walked off the edge.
[161:30.67]Yeah, it's right here.
[161:34.17]Yeah, I just turned him down.
[161:37.01]He was low, and now he was high, and then he's... I think he should be in a good spot now.
[161:40.34]I want a couple final boxes and things up here to spend money on.
[161:42.66]That sounds better.
[161:45.48]We're going to struggle with the next level, though.
[161:50.18]Alright, there's one more box here.
[161:51.82]I need more of these goat hooves.
[161:56.54]Cool, cool.
[161:57.28]I got two drones.
[161:58.23]Alright, whenever you're ready.
[161:59.37]I'll be ready in three, two, one.
[162:04.17]Will I die if I take infinite fall damage?
[162:06.21]Yeah, I'm ready.
[162:08.91]Surprisingly, no.
[162:13.85]Send us to the next zone.
[162:15.21]We're on our way.
[162:20.57]Do I die if I take infinite damage?
[162:28.21]That's an interesting question.
[162:29.87]Yeah, we're getting some good stuff.
[162:31.05]What's the question?
[162:32.97]No, you said, do I die if I take infinite fall damage?
[162:37.05]Oh, well, because the robot doesn't have a teleport or dodge roll.
[162:39.35]He just goes fast.
[162:42.95]Oh.
[162:43.49]And then rams into things.
[162:44.83]So I was curious, since I don't have, like, a stop.
[162:50.43]We're going to have to make this a quick one, because we're in medium already.
[162:54.00]Yeah.
[163:01.19]Your moveset looks kind of cool, though.
[163:03.51]It seems fun.
[163:04.17]It just seems like they overload you with HP because you're going to take tons of damage.
[163:18.46]My character has 560 HP right now.
[163:20.01]I'm going to go this way.
[163:30.46]72!
[163:32.74]Another crowbar.
[163:36.60]Ooh!
[163:37.70]A different teddy bear.
[163:39.52]Chance to block incoming damage.
[163:41.28]How much more do I have?
[163:45.56]That jump is really generous.
[163:49.65]It jumps across the whole game.
[163:55.61]Something over there?
[163:58.00]Alright, we gotta consider turning the portal around here.
[164:00.44]So if your healing drone dies, does it like recharge or does it... Like what happens?
[164:05.14]Probably not.
[164:08.00]Come on, I need 72 dollars.
[164:12.90]That's really, really good range.
[164:19.20]Will we get a raid coming?
[164:22.86]Who raided?
[164:24.06]No money.
[164:24.82]Where are the enemies on this one?
[164:26.32]Drones just die when they're killed?
[164:27.92]Good to know.
[164:28.78]Got another coin.
[164:30.92]I got two coins.
[164:32.68]Tomato?
[164:35.30]Tomato, right?
[164:35.80]What's going on, Tomato?
[164:37.98]Hope you had a good stream.
[164:38.82]I don't know what you were doing, but it was probably fucking awesome.
[164:41.92]So is it better to get the chests that are on the ground that are the same price, or the ones that have, like, the three tubes?
[164:49.65]You know what I mean?
[164:50.63]Oh, that's a good question.
[164:51.19]Because they both seem to give...
[164:53.53]I think.
[164:54.31]Similar gear.
[164:57.86]The three tubes, you choose what you want.
[164:59.50]Oh, I had just been walking up to them.
[165:01.26]It may as well be, because we don't know what anything does anyway.
[165:04.10]Etalyx and I are playing Risk of Rain 2 in cooperative mode.
[165:09.92]Yeah, we don't know what anything does anyways, guys.
[165:11.62]We've not died once.
[165:12.30]We've never played Risk of Rain 1.
[165:16.42]We haven't died one time yet, so welcome.
[165:24.42]Now, you ready to activate this thing?
[165:26.14]Yeah, I just... Can you ping me?
[165:28.66]Oh, I thought... Oh, you're just over there?
[165:29.66]Yeah, I'm just hanging out over here.
[165:30.62]I'm like at the furthest end of the map possible.
[165:37.87]I didn't find it yet, so... Oh.
[165:41.19]Well.
[165:42.17]That does change things.
[165:43.17]Sorry, I was... I got raided.
[165:47.03]Got raided by Tomato.
[165:52.83]Sponsored by fruit.
[165:53.71]He came in swinging.
[165:56.01]With all of his fucking friends.
[165:58.97]Uh, okay.
[166:02.55]I should do this.
[166:03.13]Give me something.
[166:03.63]Come on.
[166:04.05]Nothing twice in a row?
[166:07.54]Three times in a row.
[166:08.22]Third time's a charm.
[166:08.86]There it is again.
[166:09.66]Alright.
[166:14.20]Why are you linking that clip?
[166:19.66]Shito, why?
[166:24.42]It's that stupid item that sucks.
[166:26.19]So we don't know where the teleporter is.
[166:32.69]That's very... They're really gonna make a streamer mode.
[166:40.81]So we can see it better.
[166:43.98]That's what I'm saying.
[166:44.72]Yeah, I'm ready.
[166:46.14]I have to fully embrace the stream mode.
[166:49.93]Yeah, I got like a little helicopter buddy.
[166:52.47]I got a Lego set thing.
[166:53.99]Alright, well whenever we find it.
[166:57.61]Alright, look at- Alright, down here.
[166:59.61]Follow me.
[167:00.88]Over there.
[167:03.82]Like, behind that guy.
[167:06.10]Behind that guy.
[167:07.52]Behind Tommy Pickle's guy.
[167:12.46]It's here somewhere.
[167:15.29]Oh yeah, there is the orange.
[167:18.33]Right here.
[167:18.87]On this strange platform.
[167:20.01]Alright.
[167:20.91]You ready?
[167:22.83]We're on, uh, almost hard mode already.
[167:24.93]Almost, yeah.
[167:25.67]Wait, what are we looking for?
[167:28.17]Stone titan again.
[167:35.56]Stone titan again.
[167:36.96]Anything to line inside?
[167:38.42]Any small rocks?
[167:47.35]I'm just going to stay here and do damage, I guess.
[167:49.93]Is this a big enough rock?
[167:51.69]I don't think so.
[167:56.97]What kind of a person cries about farts?
[167:59.21]You have to be there.
[168:00.53]I can't... I cannot defend that cliff unless you were sitting here watching that stream two days ago.
[168:10.64]Something I should know?
[168:11.34]There's no way I can explain it.
[168:13.68]It doesn't matter.
[168:17.23]It's impossible.
[168:17.81]Alright, what did you drop?
[168:21.73]Uh, I picked up a thing that I didn't know what it did.
[168:24.51]I got a thing, too.
[168:26.04]I have a titanic knurl.
[168:28.52]Why not do it?
[168:28.92]This is actually going pretty well.
[168:31.28]Which is a strangely fun word.
[168:33.54]It's an inside joke.
[168:34.28]It's not even an inside joke.
[168:35.38]I just couldn't explain it.
[168:37.88]It would take about 30 to 40 minutes for me to explain what happened.
[168:47.04]Try.
[168:47.50]I can.
[168:49.08]You try.
[168:50.60]Call somebody into your room right now that's like at your house and explain that to them.
[169:00.95]Okay.
[169:02.13]Well, I can't be on your webcam because I don't have any clothes on.
[169:07.53]Everybody thinks that's bullshit.
[169:10.39]I don't have... I don't have any... I have no upper body clothes on.
[169:15.32]Alright, ready?
[169:15.84]Well, actually, I got money.
[169:25.79]Bullshit.
[169:27.45]You got $184?
[169:27.79]Uh, yep.
[169:28.12]Come over here.
[169:34.07]I can activate that.
[169:35.15]No, activate like this thing.
[169:36.95]It's a triumph.
[169:37.91]Well, I don't have 184 virtual dollars.
[169:40.39]Oh, you don't?
[169:41.75]I have 105.
[169:41.95]That's not enough.
[169:43.65]Alright, we got it.
[169:44.93]Let's go.
[169:45.85]We're kind of just... Any more boxes like right here?
[169:49.59]No, hold on.
[169:50.37]Not yet.
[169:50.69]I think I'll have 184 in a second.
[169:51.48]Alright.
[170:04.50]There it is.
[170:04.86]Alright, what is that?
[170:07.50]What is that little fireball?
[170:09.84]I spent $184 to see it.
[170:12.26]Somebody said, you're so greedy.
[170:15.58]I'm a simple man.
[170:16.32]I cheat.
[170:17.16]Box, I click it.
[170:20.54]Wait, can I trade, um... What is this?
[170:26.67]I'm a simple man.
[170:27.65]I'm a shmeet.
[170:31.15]Oh, that's actually not bad.
[170:32.27]Ugh.
[170:35.18]Alright, we got to get out of here.
[170:37.37]We have to get out of here.
[170:38.07]We really do.
[170:41.47]I'm teleporting away.
[170:42.31]Take us away.
[170:48.59]He said it.
[170:49.22]He said the thing.
[170:52.10]What did he say?
[170:53.20]I said the S word.
[170:57.56]Right?
[170:59.56]It's a horrible square.
[171:04.41]It breaks, like, Jeremy terms... It breaks Jerma985 terms of service when you say it.
[171:14.86]Um... Oh, not Sheetal.
[171:20.08]Alright.
[171:26.93]Let's find this thing quick so we can be ready for it.
[171:28.97]Do you see it?
[171:35.41]I have so much health, it's insane.
[171:40.51]Anybody see it?
[171:43.11]Help the streamers out.
[171:45.49]We need streamer mode engaged.
[171:55.06]Stop moving around.
[171:55.68]$278.
[171:55.70]Oh, here it is.
[172:04.80]It's there, but I haven't got a single box.
[172:06.82]Is that okay?
[172:07.44]But just be ready for it so we can just get over there quick.
[172:11.82]It's taking me a long time to kill anything.
[172:14.02]Yeah, that's kind of what I'm also experiencing.
[172:16.81]How many bits for more Shido?
[172:20.59]I don't do that.
[172:24.12]Explain this thing that you keep saying.
[172:27.56]Dude, there's no way.
[172:29.44]You and I could sit downstairs and, like, drink a bottle of whiskey over the course of, like, six hours.
[172:34.23]Would it require a bottle of whiskey?
[172:36.15]No, but I'm saying, like, it would be like a let's have, like, a six-hour conversation and, like, hang out and, like, swirl around our fucking whiskeys over ice.
[172:43.37]It'd take that long.
[172:47.44]It's a long time.
[172:48.68]I know.
[172:54.28]Okay, um... Yeah, I would have to give you a swirly before for you to understand.
[173:06.45]A swirly?
[173:07.29]Yeah.
[173:12.63]Um... Does that fold?
[173:29.35]That was kind of sad.
[173:30.27]What just happened there?
[173:31.05]Okay.
[173:34.64]I'm getting blocked by a dude.
[173:35.48]Alright, are we activating this or no?
[173:37.90]Um... What is this?
[173:39.96]Get milky crystal?
[173:42.94]Sounds like a cereal advertisement.
[173:45.20]Gain temporary flight.
[173:48.28]Oh, I dropped that.
[173:55.03]I feel like this just makes you more vulnerable to any attacks.
[173:56.99]You just have to, like, press... I'm activating it.
[173:58.85]It's very hard.
[173:59.54]Alright, we're activating this.
[174:01.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[174:02.36]Oh, shit.
[174:02.96]Hold on.
[174:03.42]I'm at... With my heal.
[174:06.14]Why did I even pick up a stupid fucking mosquito wing?
[174:08.38]Seriously.
[174:21.93]Ow.
[174:21.99]Give me this.
[174:32.98]Alright, we gotta focus on one.
[174:33.94]Left or right?
[174:36.30]Extra damage to bosses is in that 3D printer, by the way.
[174:39.64]Yeah.
[174:40.56]Like, right next to us.
[174:41.50]Oh, I gotta move.
[174:42.14]They're just gonna be right in my face.
[174:48.36]These elites are ridiculous.
[174:58.93]Where'd my missile launcher go?
[175:10.89]Somebody's shooting us from behind.
[175:12.33]No, that's you.
[175:13.39]I think you just shot me in the back, like, five times.
[175:15.33]Apologize now.
[175:16.15]I did?
[175:18.11]That's for the swirly.
[175:20.48]I didn't even give it to you yet.
[175:22.36]Dude, I don't think I could even lift you up off the ground.
[175:24.46]Like, upside down.
[175:25.36]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[175:26.12]Wow, is that a fat joke?
[175:26.90]I don't know.
[175:37.40]Okay, I'm getting sucked into the vortex.
[175:38.94]Is that a fat or a weak joke?
[175:40.22]I'm dying.
[175:40.48]I'm taking that either way.
[175:41.49]Guys.
[175:41.87]I don't know why I couldn't move.
[175:46.15]Why couldn't I fucking do anything?
[175:49.93]Did I just get double sucked?
[175:52.93]Double sucked.
[175:55.27]I couldn't.
[175:56.17]There's nothing I could do.
[176:01.63]Dodge roll didn't do anything.
[176:02.55]I was just in it.
[176:08.80]How do I use my tactical missiles again?
[176:14.32]I think I threw them away on accident.
[176:19.03]You did.
[176:19.19]Switch to railgun.
[176:20.01]No.
[176:20.51]That would require me to let go of the left mouse button.
[176:25.53]Yeah, I got pulled... I got too tethered, and no button did anything.
[176:28.51]I just... It was just time for you to die.
[176:33.80]Grab your wings.
[176:39.89]Anything else?
[176:40.67]With my $1,300 I should get before going.
[176:43.29]You have to switch your weapon.
[176:44.31]Apparently.
[176:46.97]Game's done on Switch.
[176:53.96]Everyone likes the robot.
[176:54.62]Which shoots faster, Chad?
[176:55.70]That one?
[176:58.34]Or this one?
[177:01.88]You know we're up against a time limit, right?
[177:03.18]I'm just curious.
[177:03.92]You want to know where the...
[177:10.11]Is there like a taunting mode I can do?
[177:11.49]Like, hold on.
[177:12.87]Shake my robot ass like that at the camera while you spectate helplessly?
[177:16.77]There we go.
[177:17.49]Mad because bad.
[177:18.53]Mad because bad.
[177:19.57]Mad because bad.
[177:25.72]Passive aggressive streamer.
[177:29.54]You know what I like doing?
[177:30.20]I just want to make sure you're aware there's a time limit.
[177:32.00]Do you know that?
[177:35.28]Oh, we're on insane already.
[177:36.80]Yep, this is going to be it.
[177:41.44]I was going to hold this back from you, but I decided to tell you.
[177:43.64]I picked up a second coin.
[177:49.52]I also have two coins.
[177:50.68]Well, how come you didn't tell me about the second one?
[177:53.18]I did.
[177:53.46]I told you both times.
[177:55.88]Check the VOD.
[177:56.35]I'm going to watch the whole VOD to make sure.
[178:01.45]Insane.
[178:02.85]And then after that is important.
[178:06.91]Imposter, more like.
[178:09.71]Insane, important, and then... whatever comes after.
[178:17.48]Alright, I'm not touching, like, the Dragon Claw.
[178:20.14]I'm not convinced this does any damage.
[178:21.68]Shrine of Combat.
[178:23.34]No, I ain't doing that.
[178:24.38]This is like a boss.
[178:34.77]Dodge rolling.
[178:35.57]This guy's joking me around.
[178:41.74]He's acting like a player.
[178:50.88]Oh, man.
[178:51.40]This is going to be rough.
[178:55.29]This is bad.
[179:01.59]Touch it.
[179:01.99]Touch it.
[179:02.27]I'm not going to... Guys, look at how much we're struggling already here.
[179:17.40]There's a giant dinosaur.
[179:18.66]There's like a Monster Rancher enemy over here.
[179:23.08]I'm gonna die.
[179:35.16]Jesus, leave me alone.
[179:42.83]I'm dead.
[179:47.98]I don't like this character.
[179:54.44]This character seems incredibly vulnerable.
[180:07.15]Are you dead?
[180:08.17]Yeah, oh yeah, I died in... Oh, sorry.
[180:10.32]I took like 75% of my health in 2 tenths of a second.
[180:12.32]Oh, well then, let me just...
[180:17.39]What'd you just do?
[180:17.83]What'd you do that for?
[180:19.15]Because we, I didn't even get, I wasn't even close.
[180:20.85]I don't even know where the thing was.
[180:21.85]What about our stats?
[180:22.67]What about our statistics?
[180:26.97]Game knows.
[180:27.65]Auto-save.
[180:32.63]Well, I unlocked the robot too.
[180:34.91]See?
[180:36.59]Auto-save.
[180:37.65]Let me see.
[180:39.51]That's too many words.
[180:40.89]I don't want to do it.
[180:41.63]Too many words to read.
[180:46.01]Retool, yeah.
[180:49.99]Rapidly fire nails.
[180:51.49]Cool.
[180:52.21]Are we going to do double robot?
[180:54.83]We could be different.
[180:58.43]I mean, we could do it.
[181:00.64]I haven't been commando guy in a while.
[181:02.64]So it's stun canister.
[181:06.60]Basically, you're going to get yelled at for using the wrong weapon.
[181:10.14]So just get ready.
[181:10.84]That's alright.
[181:11.96]No matter what.
[181:14.48]That's fine.
[181:14.91]By me.
[181:15.57]I'm going to be the one yelling.
[181:17.65]You don't yell at me.
[181:20.56]I'm like, quit, you sniper!
[181:22.43]Am I crazy or is the taskbar button for this game Planetside 2?
[181:27.35]Taskbar?
[181:28.27]Like on your taskbar.
[181:33.82]Yeah, it kind of is.
[181:34.72]It's the big number two with a font that I'm pretty sure that I downloaded from dafont.com a long time ago.
[181:40.90]You didn't.
[181:44.49]Alright, let's see.
[181:44.93]Blast canister is a launch a stun canister for 220.
[181:47.01]And then a weird symbol I don't recognize.
[181:51.61]It's like a bicycle?
[181:53.49]It's a top with a butterfly.
[181:54.87]Do you want me to unlock so you can read?
[181:57.83]220 butterfly.
[181:58.73]Too late.
[181:59.81]I don't know what that means, but... We're going in.
[182:02.59]Okay.
[182:04.41]Yeah, let's go.
[182:05.56]I'll figure it out.
[182:14.26]I'm looking over here.
[182:14.96]Really?
[182:18.13]What?
[182:20.31]Nobody liked that one.
[182:22.83]They all didn't like that.
[182:24.75]Which one?
[182:26.05]I said something stupid.
[182:29.63]So this is now... You can charge that.
[182:32.32]Okay.
[182:34.26]You can actually just tap left click, I found out.
[182:36.26]It feels like you have to hold it down, though.
[182:39.28]Oh.
[182:40.56]This is like the sprint around mode.
[182:43.95]So that's sprint around mode.
[182:45.09]This is the switch mode.
[182:46.12]Double switch.
[182:48.34]Now where the hell's an enemy?
[182:57.08]This game's supposed to be hard.
[182:58.59]Where are the enemies?
[183:01.77]Speed run.
[183:08.57]Where are the enemies though?
[183:17.28]Well, I'm awful with this character.
[183:20.16]It's kind of difficult, but you get a lot of health.
[183:21.88]Look at your health pool.
[183:22.74]Oh, I do.
[183:23.20]You're right.
[183:28.29]Spam right click, basically.
[183:30.79]Right click.
[183:31.43]Can I hold it?
[183:32.11]Okay, I can.
[183:35.97]It's like a stun bomb.
[183:41.02]Hey, does anyone see the teleporter?
[183:45.05]That is a pretty generous hitbox.
[183:46.01]I hope they make them a little bit easier to find in the future patch.
[183:53.31]I got double shield.
[183:54.73]It's actually kind of fun to use this.
[184:03.57]It's a one-hit kill for a lot of enemies.
[184:05.49]Yeah, it's really good at just chomping on chumps.
[184:13.14]And this is the... How long does this last for?
[184:15.18]Do I cancel if I jump?
[184:16.22]I do.
[184:16.56]Not even a fucking good game.
[184:20.20]Oops.
[184:21.80]Whoa.
[184:24.00]Um... I was waiting for you to come around.
[184:25.78]We should probably... Activate.
[184:28.15]Activate.
[184:28.65]Yeah.
[184:30.51]It's just like a shitty run.
[184:32.11]This is like a wash run.
[184:33.29]Not gonna... You know what I mean?
[184:36.11]Yeah.
[184:36.33]Reset.
[184:39.93]So what's better to use?
[184:40.77]Like this or this here?
[184:41.73]Probably this.
[184:48.24]This, I think.
[184:53.62]Between the two.
[184:56.78]Like when the stupid stone guys get stuck and they just sit there and jump in place on the trampoline.
[185:04.83]Now, does holding it do anything else or is it just kill?
[185:10.07]Oh, hi.
[185:11.01]It's the boss.
[185:21.59]Oh.
[185:31.91]Oh dear.
[185:33.25]This is not a place I want to be.
[185:35.10]Does that go through everybody?
[185:35.98]I think it does.
[185:37.96]Oh, that's actually really good.
[185:50.06]Ooh!
[185:52.94]Another coin!
[185:59.59]Alright, the boss is dead.
[186:01.63]Yes.
[186:07.81]Yes.
[186:10.33]Yes!
[186:12.05]Yes!
[186:24.15]We got the... Alright, cool.
[186:25.93]Red whip.
[186:26.57]Alright, we each get to move fast out of combat.
[186:28.93]That's a boss drop.
[186:29.95]I'm disappointed.
[186:31.57]That's still alright.
[186:33.76]Boomer reference.
[186:37.98]You know, you guys say that, but... You wanna try the money machine?
[186:41.36]You laughed at it.
[186:43.48]Money machine!
[186:44.32]Oh, yeah!
[186:47.11]Fruit.
[186:48.57]Um...
[186:51.59]I'll save you a box.
[186:53.47]Is there a box here?
[186:54.35]There's a box.
[186:57.49]Right there.
[187:03.60]Why did that look like I was going slower?
[187:05.68]I also busted the other money machine just for you.
[187:10.36]What about I can do to go?
[187:13.41]Oh, the mask of Inferno.
[187:16.05]I like prep that for you.
[187:18.70]Yeah, you like, you sat at like the slot machine.
[187:21.48]I sat at that machine.
[187:22.31]And spent like five grand and lost everything.
[187:24.75]And I came over and put a dollar in.
[187:27.35]Thanks.
[187:29.43]Hey, let's go.
[187:30.85]Hey.
[187:32.07]You have money?
[187:33.91]I have $14.
[187:34.61]No, I don't.
[187:39.05]Granny sniped your slot.
[187:41.53]Yeah.
[187:46.50]Cool.
[187:49.85]You guys should be nice to your elders.
[187:58.20]Right off the bat, we've got a hurt me machine.
[188:00.76]I'll take it.
[188:03.12]You can do it too.
[188:05.02]Oh, thank you.
[188:05.84]Mm-hmm.
[188:06.58]What about over here?
[188:07.14]How much gold did you get?
[188:08.48]I got 110.
[188:09.54]But which one of these do I want?
[188:11.38]Why don't you get more money for losing less health?
[188:15.56]Rapidly heal outside of danger.
[188:17.23]That's actually kind of good.
[188:19.61]Oops.
[188:21.52]Oh, he turns into a ghost, right.
[188:25.84]Two luck.
[188:26.50]It feels like two luck sometimes.
[188:28.91]Fuck it.
[188:29.27]No, I'm not doing it again.
[188:29.97]Let's go nine luck.
[188:35.97]Ah, yeah.
[188:37.44]Too bad it's a med kit.
[188:44.16]So there's an initial burst on that, isn't there?
[188:46.14]That's cool.
[188:46.92]That's why you should switch between them.
[188:48.48]On the right click?
[188:49.24]Yeah, for the robot.
[188:50.16]Okay.
[188:59.86]Oops, I keep thinking that's right click for some reason.
[189:10.78]Got some money?
[189:12.62]Wait, people are saying they can't see squad mode because it's not working.
[189:15.96]Has it not been on the whole time and nobody said anything?
[189:18.58]It says it's on.
[189:21.49]Yeah, it says it's on.
[189:22.17]It says my squad.
[189:24.69]It says my squad.
[189:25.81]Maybe Twitch just fucking... It's a new feature and they're just like, fuck, we don't know what to do about this.
[189:33.39]Here, I'm going to leave.
[189:35.67]And then... Squad bait.
[189:38.55]Oops, I just invited someone else.
[189:40.65]Hold on.
[189:42.47]Dude, come on, bring him in!
[189:44.35]Invite him to the squad!
[189:46.57]Okay, there we go.
[189:51.37]I just sent you the invite.
[189:52.43]Alright, well, hold on.
[189:57.16]We can refresh.
[189:57.96]You're gonna have to protect me over here, because I need to like... Not even close.
[190:03.72]Let me see.
[190:09.19]my squad uh I don't see anything let's see except we're in a squad we're in the squad apparently we're in a squad a lot of timing on that
[190:30.07]Alright, does it work now?
[190:31.01]Uh, I don't think so.
[190:34.19]I don't, people are saying, I don't see, what are people saying?
[190:39.16]Nothing.
[190:42.52]Nothing.
[190:42.92]It's pretty simple on our side because there's literally, you type in the name, send an invitation, they accept, and that's supposed to be it.
[190:49.51]Well, it doesn't seem to be doing its intended function.
[191:00.82]Was he any sign of the thing the squad button is kind of hard to see to be honest when it does work it's like above the stream and To the right.
[191:11.70]No, we don't need to be in a squad.
[191:13.14]We're like we're our squad in game Everyone knows us as the squad You are taking way too many of these nails I Need a box, please
[191:30.67]Yeah, I need, like, something to spend on.
[191:37.63]Nothing.
[191:38.23]Come on.
[191:39.93]Come on, really.
[191:40.87]I can hear you losing now across the map.
[191:45.35]Yeah, I did.
[191:46.13]I'll be able to do it one more time here.
[191:54.44]Then we got to activate this.
[192:08.07]115, was it?
[192:16.83]Do you know where the teleporter is?
[192:18.99]It's over here, I think.
[192:20.26]I can't do it anymore.
[192:22.42]Oh, did you take this one?
[192:23.56]Oh, you did.
[192:24.68]I did.
[192:25.16]I sniped it.
[192:30.52]Is there another box or something?
[192:31.87]Alright, we're going to find the thing.
[192:32.89]We're going to find the teleporter.
[192:39.74]I'm just gonna go speed mode.
[192:43.58]Oh.
[192:48.68]Um... See it?
[192:50.48]Over here.
[192:53.36]Go that way.

[193:17.11]Ready to give this try?
[193:18.55]Yeah, I'm just popping this last, uh, money machine.

[193:26.76]I'm ready.
[193:27.22]I just... Oops.
[193:30.52]Wait, how do I cycle my... I... active.
[193:36.72]Oh.
[193:38.26]I get it.
[193:39.46]Okay, that makes sense.
[193:43.11]That's not just cycling my cannon.
[193:45.99]That's cycling everything.
[194:04.84]Excuse me.
[194:05.62]I missed my super boss damage.
[194:13.08]Ow.
[194:14.26]I'm getting killed by these, like, bells.
[194:16.43]I have a lot of health.
[194:17.03]This thing... I was scared.
[194:18.59]I was gonna just... I'm the one.
[194:21.09]I'm coming to you.
[194:24.61]Oh, there's a lot of bells.
[194:27.66]Oh my god.
[194:40.83]He's gonna take the bells out from afar.
[194:43.03]Boss is almost dead.

[195:02.67]Boss is down.
[195:03.47]Nice.
[195:10.72]This is really a million of these things.
[195:15.62]We've never seen anything like this before.
[195:17.26]Uh-oh.
[195:19.67]Because we're almost on hard on the second level.
[195:22.33]We took too long, I guess.
[195:23.81]We took too long.
[195:25.73]Teleport is ready, though.
[195:26.59]It's the name of the game.
[195:28.69]We took too long.
[195:30.22]It re-
[195:33.05]Yeah, that is the title.
[195:33.87]I don't think there's anything else to spend money on.
[195:37.39]I don't know.
[195:37.77]I don't see anything.
[195:39.11]We gotta just get out of here.
[195:43.67]Might as well.
[195:44.37]Take us out.
[195:45.95]No, you take us out.
[195:47.82]You take us out.
[195:49.08]No, you take us out.
[195:50.96]You play us on out of here.
[195:53.84]I'll get it.
[195:54.32]I got it.
[195:59.48]We both did it.
[196:00.28]We both pressed it together.
[196:02.16]Good job.
[196:14.01]Alright, cool.
[196:16.69]Should I get a drumstick or what?
[196:19.17]No.
[196:26.44]Yo, I pushed the squad button.
[196:28.00]See if it works.
[196:29.14]Come on.
[196:32.34]There was a hidden button.
[196:33.98]What are you talking about with the squad?
[196:36.16]You have to, like, actually... It's not enough that we're both live and that we do the invitation, but we also... You have to, like, initiate it.
[196:43.40]What?
[196:44.90]It's active.
[196:49.88]So, chatters unite.
[196:53.78]Only took three hours.
[196:56.08]But you know what?
[196:56.80]Better late than never.
[196:58.46]Name of the game.
[196:59.12]What's the name of the game, chat?
[197:00.18]Took too long.
[197:06.52]Alright, here we go.
[197:09.62]We have to activate this shit, like, now.
[197:13.08]We're in hard.
[197:13.74]I hate these time boxes that really are like, you're too slow.
[197:26.83]Sorry, you can't open this.
[197:29.33]There's a mega skull back there.
[197:30.83]There's so many shrines and no boxes.
[197:43.12]Alright, I got money.
[197:44.18]I'm going this way.
[197:50.29]Rapidly heal outside.
[197:51.35]I need some of these.
[197:54.01]If you see an equipment box, could you let me know?
[197:56.11]Because I have a thing that lets me double charge any equipment, but I haven't found any.
[198:01.41]I'm just going to find the teleporter.
[198:11.39]Hey, there's one.
[198:13.69]Too bad it's temporary flight again.
[198:17.74]I'm going to say it's over here.

[198:53.48]It's up there.
[198:59.34]It's a little... Ooh, this thing costs one Lunar.
[199:03.82]Is that worth it?
[199:06.61]Is it worth it for a coin of the order?
[199:09.63]I don't know.
[199:10.45]Considering we've been here for a while, this run might stop at the next... No, that is a meme.
[199:16.15]Okay.

[199:19.29]It's a meme.

[210:16.46]Where are the enemies?
[210:23.92]Where are the enemies?
[210:24.80]I believe they are flying in the sky.
[210:26.47]Yeah, there's two of them.
[210:30.87]Three boxes over here.
[210:31.81]Yep.
[210:32.81]Like you said.
[210:33.83]Yeah, there's no way to get money.
[210:41.26]There we go.
[210:45.84]Faster attack speed.
[210:46.74]Nice.
[210:48.12]Give me that like three or four times.
[210:50.18]Yeah, I think faster attack speed would be a game saver.
[210:57.31]Keep right clicking for some reason.
[210:59.01]We might consider turning it on.
[211:01.17]Do we know where it is right here?
[211:03.31]No, but we got to go looking for it.
[211:05.83]It should be.
[211:06.89]I see it.
[211:07.75]It's over here.
[211:11.47]Thank you, Sig, for the Sig Boor.
[211:15.15]For the five community subs.
[211:16.83]Thank you.
[211:18.88]Thank you, Sig.
[211:22.72]Appreciate it.
[211:23.52]Dropping five subs.
[211:26.74]Attack speed is awesome.
[211:27.60]Oh, by the way, I activated the mountain thing.
[211:30.74]I did.
[211:30.88]I was sitting right next to you.
[211:33.37]When I activated the mountain thing?
[211:35.38]Oh, I thought you meant activated the... No, we got two because of that.
[211:40.74]Extra rewards.
[211:41.38]It was worth it.
[211:42.60]Is this piercing?
[211:49.50]Wow.
[211:56.36]Ow, that hurt.
[211:58.70]Yeah, these fire enemies gotta go.
[212:01.14]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[212:01.82]This was going so well until about five seconds ago.
[212:05.37]Now heal me, bot.
[212:25.39]How we doing?
[212:25.85]We're okay.
[212:27.55]Back?
[212:27.75]We're okay.
[212:31.51]Whoops.
[212:32.01]Oh god.
[212:32.95]I'm so sorry.
[212:34.30]I got cocky.
[212:35.50]Sorry.
[212:42.22]Really cocky.
[212:48.02]Alright, like I said, get the one on the right.
[212:49.20]The one with less health.
[212:56.99]One down.
[212:57.65]We're gonna get four items, aren't we?
[213:00.67]Uh, I don't know.
[213:01.49]Do you get... I guess you should get something for beating the mountain challenge, right?
[213:05.97]Yeah, you just do it, but we just double it up.
[213:07.31]I don't know.
[213:13.10]There it is.
[213:13.48]Yeah, there's four.
[213:16.90]We're going to do rock, paper, scissors over who gets the yellow?
[213:19.66]Well, the yellow is just the beetle, so it's beneficial to both of us.
[213:23.91]Hold an additional equipment charge.
[213:26.96]That's really good.
[213:28.99]Do you have an equipment?
[213:29.73]Because I don't.
[213:30.45]I do not, but... Well... You grab the beetle, then.
[213:37.29]You have, like, the buddy.
[213:38.03]Because you're slower.
[213:39.52]I am very slow.
[213:41.76]It's nice to have some backup.
[213:42.92]Alright, now we look for boxes.
[213:49.74]Coin?
[213:50.00]Where's the coin?
[213:50.99]Oh, there is a coin right there.
[213:51.95]Yeah, there is a coin.
[213:53.37]How many do you have?
[213:53.91]I have two.
[213:55.37]Alright.
[213:55.61]Alright, ready?
[213:56.17]You got it.
[213:56.91]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[213:58.37]What'd you put out?
[213:58.79]I have three.
[213:59.49]Oh.
[213:59.61]You can have it.
[214:00.23]Thanks, I win.
[214:02.17]Thanks, I win.
[214:03.11]Alright, anything else?
[214:05.76]I see a couple of things right here.
[214:07.34]Here's an active.
[214:07.98]Alright, I got three charges of the cube.
[214:12.88]That's... pretty good.
[214:17.79]Is there a box back here?
[214:22.25]Oh, fuck.
[214:26.92]Wasting time.
[214:28.06]And this is actually really good.
[214:29.04]Yeah, we should probably just get out of here then.
[214:32.60]Oops, I forgot to look in the different... I didn't know what bustling fungus was anyways.
[214:36.12]Now I know.
[214:36.69]Never pick the fungus.
[214:39.31]Cube.
[214:41.51]Any more boxes over by you that are not open?
[214:45.15]Not that I see yet.
[214:47.33]I don't see any either.
[214:50.08]It's good for a special build.
[214:52.82]There's one more box up here that I'm going to get.
[214:55.67]Grab it, because we're about to be medium.
[214:59.49]Going as fast as my little wheels will carry me.
[215:06.19]Let's go boss damage.
[215:09.87]Ready?
[215:10.95]Yep.
[215:11.39]One, two, three, go.
[215:15.48]He's grabbing me.
[215:19.18]Cube is the best item in the game, is it?
[215:29.39]Alright, let's make this quick.
[215:32.11]100.
[215:33.37]Turrets are not... The stationary turrets are really not that great.
[215:38.45]Because they just stay in the same spot and they don't come with you.
[215:43.15]The healing ones and the little floaty guys, they do.
[215:45.33]I guess maybe in some scenarios it's not a bad idea?
[215:57.49]Is there no key item anymore?
[216:00.66]Was there... You had to get a key in the first one?
[216:06.37]I guess.
[216:10.01]How much does this cost?
[216:12.49]$72.
[216:12.53]Well, I can't believe they're charging that for an early access game.
[216:18.85]72 again.
[216:22.04]Outrageous.
[216:22.58]71, 72...
[216:30.58]I'm taking it.
[216:31.02]Yeah, take it.
[216:32.18]That's good.
[216:36.88]There's another box here for 72.
[216:38.22]Another one there.
[216:40.04]Boss damage.
[216:45.36]I'm gonna go this way.
[216:46.66]I love my little shield on my robin.
[216:53.78]A lot of sight there.
[216:55.20]I'm praying to the Shrine of the Mountain.
[216:56.97]Oh, God.
[216:58.75]You're bold.
[217:01.29]Very bald.
[217:02.77]Go big or go home.
[217:10.54]116.
[217:10.56]72.
[217:11.16]Yeah.
[217:11.72]I want to go up there and get the money machine.
[217:17.46]Sticky bomb.
[217:24.86]Oops, I missed that one.
[217:25.94]That was a misclick.
[217:29.79]Got more boss damage.
[217:39.52]Any sights on the I see orange I see orange.
[217:46.32]It's like in this area.
[217:49.76]Here it is.
[217:53.91]Are you ready?
[217:55.55]Um, I guess.
[217:58.13]I need to give you some boxes.
[217:59.85]I got some.
[218:00.23]I'm kind of far away.
[218:00.80]Seems like I have a lot more items.
[218:07.44]You kind of do, but it's all good.
[218:11.42]I'm going to activate this.
[218:13.27]I got 140 bucks now.
[218:14.17]I think there's another box over here.
[218:15.61]Right.
[218:18.57]Where's there a box?
[218:19.67]I got money.
[218:21.35]I'm standing right on the thing when you're ready.
[218:24.01]I need one box.
[218:25.61]Ah, just do it.
[218:26.05]Alright, this is going to be the super one, so good luck.
[218:32.57]Yep.
[218:34.27]Two stone titans.
[218:36.90]Oh, that's going to be nutty.
[218:42.48]I should do really good boss damage, though.
[218:44.56]You should.
[218:46.02]Whoa, where's the other one?
[218:47.10]Did we even get another one?
[218:51.72]Yeah, he's up on the rocks to the left.
[218:52.94]Yeah, he's up there.
[218:53.32]Let's try to kill him on the bottom first.
[218:54.44]See if we can just get rid of him.
[219:02.06]He's like stuck.
[219:11.87]Geb just deflected my own... We'll get him.
[219:19.65]He's going down.
[219:22.88]Dead.
[219:23.42]Alright, one down.
[219:24.24]Now the one's up top, right?
[219:27.06]Yep.
[219:34.85]Well, I can't.
[219:35.95]Oh!
[219:36.53]Okay, there's already boss loot.
[219:39.25]So I picked up one.
[219:41.47]There's more, though.
[219:43.01]I almost just steamrolled over all the boss loot.
[219:47.02]Well, at least somebody would have.
[219:47.96]It's like I was in my speed mode.
[219:50.78]I'm getting hit.
[219:56.61]We did it!
[219:57.55]That's double- we got double loot, twice.
[219:59.53]Yep.
[220:02.03]That means we should do fairly decent this time.
[220:04.42]Alright, I think they're all the same, so I'm just gonna take two, and you can have the other two.
[220:08.32]It's invisibility on heavy damage.
[220:11.12]Okay.
[220:12.94]So how heavy does it have to be?
[220:14.16]I don't know, it seems fairly generous.
[220:16.46]Well, for you to stack it, I mean, if that would- does it make the attacks lighter?
[220:19.93]Alright, we got money, let's move to pick up some stuff.
[220:24.13]Yeah.
[220:29.85]It's generous, it is.
[220:30.79]Okay, that's good.
[220:32.35]Come on, give me something.
[220:36.54]There was another Shrine of the Mountain.
[220:37.56]Oh, there were two.
[220:42.02]It's technically random damage.
[220:44.52]Huh.
[220:45.58]That's weird.
[220:48.26]Yeah, I found the secret box stash up here.
[220:50.14]Is this a box?
[220:52.26]Yes, it is.
[220:56.19]More sticky bombs.
[221:02.40]drop healing orb good there's a luck shrine what is this nice so um when you get a war banner again let's just make the war banner even better probably there's a 137 dollar uh luck shrine that I primed for you
[221:25.16]If you want it.
[221:26.22]Where is it?
[221:27.41]137.
[221:27.49]I marked it.
[221:28.91]Dude, I have... I failed twice in a row.
[221:31.11]I have so many drones.
[221:34.67]I have one, two, three, four, five.
[221:36.15]I have five drones.
[221:37.39]Alright, I'm coming to you for it.
[221:46.36]Three healing drones and two gunner drones.
[221:51.20]Nothing.
[221:52.18]Alright, I'm going... Yeah, activate it.
[221:54.74]Yep.
[221:56.04]Going home.
[222:01.08]Oh, there's a blood shrine up there too.
[222:02.39]Can I get it before we go?
[222:03.79]Nope.
[222:05.55]Don't even need it.
[222:07.65]I got it.
[222:08.01]No, I didn't.
[222:08.71]Shit.
[222:11.39]Damn it.
[222:15.93]Alright, let's move.
[222:23.88]Money.
[222:24.18]Quick money.
[222:27.16]120.
[222:27.18]Get the timed box.
[222:32.43]Oh, there's a timed box.
[222:34.77]We have like 40 seconds to get it.
[222:36.85]Where is it?
[222:37.23]Where is it?
[222:37.91]I don't know.
[222:39.09]It's in like a... Is it over here?
[222:41.75]I think I saw it here before.
[222:43.15]How many seconds?
[222:44.92]Is it too late?
[222:45.96]Somebody said 15 minutes.
[222:46.78]It's minus 430 for this timed box.
[222:49.60]Oh.
[222:50.82]It has to be 10 minutes.
[222:52.62]Oh, we were close.
[222:56.92]Somebody said it sucks anyways.
[222:58.24]I don't know if that's true.
[223:00.95]Maybe they just said that to make us feel better.
[223:02.69]Maybe.
[223:04.61]Somebody said, I thought it was 15 for co-op.
[223:06.73]Apparently not, I guess.
[223:16.55]And, alright.
[223:17.21]Give me this.
[223:23.06]More healing outside of danger.
[223:24.44]What is this?
[223:24.84]Is this the luck one?
[223:26.08]No, that's the other shrine thing.
[223:27.90]Alright, I'm gonna just go look for it.
[223:30.58]Just so we can know where it is.
[223:31.34]Because we're rolling on hard.
[223:32.48]This is not terrible.
[223:33.26]Look at all my little buddies.
[223:44.95]Flying in.
[223:50.58]You're annoying.
[224:02.58]I bleed damage or super banner three.
[224:07.76]We got here.
[224:18.60]These crits are insane when they hit, they hit pretty frequently.
[224:21.59]That's a money too.
[224:22.29]Alright money, what is this?
[224:25.13]Reactivate fan.
[224:27.39]Up.
[224:30.27]Rapidly heal outside danger.
[224:33.97]That's a pretty good amount of shit over here.
[224:36.43]242.
[224:37.77]Ooh.
[224:37.97]Move faster.
[224:43.23]I want some more damage.
[224:51.60]I have a lot of weird utility upgrades.
[224:53.70]I'll go this way.
[224:56.04]There's another large box up here, right?
[225:00.17]Oops.
[225:00.41]Oops.
[225:04.97]That should be enough to get something.
[225:09.09]Oh, glasses.
[225:10.09]New reactivity fan again?
[225:11.65]I got rid of mushrooms for glasses.
[225:13.73]That's pretty odd.
[225:14.38]Hey, there's a glass.
[225:18.18]I'm just going to get rid of everything for glasses.
[225:21.18]Can I do that over and over again?
[225:22.28]I don't know.
[225:29.18]There goes the knife.
[225:31.34]Thought I could get him.
[225:36.07]There goes, I don't know what that is.
[225:41.34]Probably should go up.
[225:41.80]Alright, four pairs of sunglasses.
[225:44.16]Ten glasses, 100% crit.
[225:47.48]So what, you're at like 40% chance to crit?
[225:50.50]Yeah, I'm at 50% right now.
[225:52.36]I'm going for 100% crit chance.
[225:53.98]I'm just getting rid of everything.
[225:56.64]Oh my god.
[225:57.46]Alright.
[225:58.48]You have to experiment.
[225:59.48]It's the glasses chest.
[226:02.57]Duplicate the same item seven times in a row.
[226:07.37]Alright, that should be all of them, right?
[226:10.75]Is this bugged?
[226:11.59]Yeah, come on.
[226:12.61]That's bullshit.
[226:13.93]There goes my banner.
[226:14.81]150 gold to do it again.
[226:17.99]Alright, I have 10.
[226:20.05]So you have a 100% chance to crit.
[226:24.33]That's correct.
[226:25.69]Well, hopefully we can see the end of the game now.
[226:30.19]That'd be nice.
[226:30.69]I don't know which is faster damage or not.
[226:39.49]Come on.
[226:40.15]I got it.
[226:40.51]Good.
[226:41.07]No, I have so many slugs.
[226:44.49]100% unstoppable crit.
[226:46.15]I can only just die.
[226:48.26]I don't know what I had to give up to get to this point.
[226:50.50]I have so many.
[226:51.44]How many slugs do I have?
[226:52.30]Alright, where's the stupid thing?
[226:55.46]It's time.
[226:56.24]It is time.
[227:04.11]I don't see any up there.
[227:07.79]That way.
[227:10.92]I got streamer eyes.
[227:12.84]I can see it.
[227:13.68]Did you get the patch already?
[227:15.40]Yep.
[227:20.07]Ooh.
[227:21.91]I can die once.
[227:23.79]I'm allowed to die.
[227:24.71]Yeah, it's up here.
[227:34.08]Extra jump.
[227:35.06]Very nice.
[227:36.08]Up here.
[227:37.90]Oh, got it.
[227:39.06]You wanna turn it on?
[227:39.84]You ready to go?
[227:40.90]Hold on, I gotta come to you.
[227:45.62]Now, if you can find Harvester, you heal every time you crit.
[227:49.31]That seems the same.
[227:50.29]No, that would be really good.
[227:55.17]Here we go, you ready?
[227:55.75]Alright, I'm ready.
[227:56.69]One, two, three.
[227:59.13]Who is it?
[228:01.44]It's the Imp Overlord.
[228:02.66]Imp Overlord, 20,000 health.
[228:10.29]Eat this.
[228:10.81]Just spam it all out there.
[228:13.52]Just eat it.
[228:18.90]Does that damage stack?
[228:20.94]I have a lot of, like, tingley crit noises going on.
[228:25.92]Tingley crit sound.
[228:28.31]It's like... It's like sleet.
[228:29.17]It's like hail lightly falling on your tin roof.
[228:36.02]It looks really cool.
[228:37.36]Look at his health bar.
[228:38.36]Look at his health bar.
[228:39.26]Yeah, he's just melting them.
[228:43.76]Holy shit.
[228:45.68]He's dead.
[228:53.41]Well, that's one way to do it.
[228:55.35]Whoa, almost just ran into that.
[229:02.67]We have a lot of money, though.
[229:06.99]I left the boss item for you.
[229:08.92]Thank you.
[229:10.62]That is yours.
[229:11.36]Okay.
[229:13.34]We have got a lot of money.
[229:14.84]I didn't see any boxes, though.
[229:16.44]No?
[229:17.04]No boxes?
[229:19.84]Really?
[229:22.56]Just this one right here.
[229:23.82]Literally just this one.
[229:26.66]Just grab it.
[229:27.46]I'm going to just check down here one more time.
[229:29.30]I got to wait until we teleport charge.
[229:32.75]Otherwise, we'll never be able to pick them up.
[229:35.32]Wait, does my lightning crit too for the ukulele?
[229:38.00]That's a fan.
[229:40.60]I'll stay here in charge while you search.
[229:46.24]There's a canister here.
[229:50.85]Nothing.
[229:51.23]There's a timed one.
[229:55.01]Yeah, I got one here.
[229:56.41]What is it that we want?
[229:57.81]This one.
[230:00.94]More boss damage.
[230:03.65]What else?
[230:04.05]Anything else?
[230:06.23]What about inside here?
[230:07.72]I gotta increase attack speed.
[230:10.36]No.
[230:15.58]Are you... Not yet.
[230:18.99]Hold on.
[230:24.47]Okay, I got a crit chance.
[230:28.31]There's like one... Double crowbars.
[230:31.81]Oh wait, that's going to stack.
[230:33.01]Deal more damage to healthy enemies with super crit.
[230:36.93]It's going to stack for sure.
[230:38.07]I got the gamer glasses now.
[230:43.23]So now me go get ten glasses?
[230:48.03]Can I use that machine that you were using?
[230:50.48]You can, but you have to give up random stuff.
[230:55.32]Well...
[230:56.44]So it could ruin your build, potentially.
[230:58.12]I mean, my build, I don't really have one.
[231:02.10]How many do I have right now?
[231:05.56]Alright, here's like a sticky bomb.
[231:11.00]See, I have like sticky bombs.
[231:12.48]Let's do it.
[231:13.60]Let's be the Crit Brothers.
[231:15.45]Crit Brothers.
[231:17.07]Super lens glasses.
[231:19.17]How many do you need?
[231:21.69]Ten for a hundred.
[231:27.06]Yeah, get rid of the slugs.
[231:30.64]Alright, I'm at sixty percent.
[231:34.00]Seventy percent.
[231:38.27]Oh!
[231:39.57]I lost a pretty good item.
[231:42.51]Well, might as well just go... Oh my god, I lost two of them!
[231:44.95]Alright, we might... Uh-oh.
[231:47.41]Was it worth it?
[231:48.69]It's not worth it, but we're both a hundred percent crit.
[231:51.93]Let's go.
[231:52.23]What'd you lose?
[231:52.77]Uh, everything.
[231:56.20]I have to say it dramatically.
[231:57.72]Everything.
[232:01.07]Alright, get us out of here.
[232:04.13]I lost, uh, two boss damage things and I lost some really, really good stuff.
[232:09.01]Is it possible to get 11 of an item, or is 10 the max?
[232:13.46]110% crit, that's kinda, how would that work?
[232:16.72]You ready?
[232:18.48]Somebody said that's the, yeah, there's the reference for this stream.
[232:24.14]True, ride or die.
[232:25.62]All crit.
[232:26.22]All the time.
[232:26.88]Yeah.
[232:30.28]Let's see.
[232:30.62]Okay, let's just not get popped here.
[232:32.42]Just don't instantly die.
[232:33.52]121 damage a hit.
[232:35.66]Holy shit, this is actually pretty ridiculous.
[232:39.27]Uh... We should do fairly well.
[232:43.13]We should, yeah.
[232:43.57]I mean, you have auto-aim and you auto-crit, so like... All you have to do is sprint.
[232:47.61]In theory.
[232:49.43]In theory.
[232:54.80]I don't have enough money here.
[233:03.36]This dinosaur used to be so obnoxious, now.
[233:05.34]Alright, 157.
[233:09.55]225, let's get it.
[233:10.01]Stupid fucking heal.
[233:25.83]Extra damage to bosses.
[233:27.09]That's what you want.
[233:28.67]Oh, I thought your guy was a bad guy.
[233:31.29]Yeah, I did the same thing all the time.
[233:34.45]Another stupid healing slug.
[233:35.61]Two in a row.
[233:36.72]Oh, I see the dust.
[233:39.30]If you want to rush before we get to impossible.
[233:41.88]We probably should.
[233:46.88]I mean, at this point, we're almost at impossible.
[233:50.60]What do I need to activate this?
[233:51.62]150?
[233:51.64]450.
[233:52.12]Ah.
[233:55.83]Alright, uh, you ready?
[233:57.13]Uh, yeah.
[233:59.43]Might as well just do it.
[234:08.14]Alright, crit!
[234:14.48]It is the Stone Titan!
[234:20.29]He does do a lot of damage.
[234:22.63]He does do a lot, but if we all DPS him, it should be fine.
[234:26.27]There's other people fucking flying around here too.
[234:29.74]No!
[234:30.50]Bad, very bad, very bad.
[234:31.90]I gotta get out.
[234:32.36]Alright, one's dead.
[234:41.83]Need these heal bots.
[234:50.55]Holy shit.
[234:51.17]Melt him.
[234:52.51]Melt him.
[234:53.33]Your turn.
[234:54.51]I need a breather.
[235:06.50]There's so much going on, it's like a raid, like in a WoW raid.
[235:15.17]Oh fuck man, he's spamming that at me.
[235:17.13]He's dead.
[235:18.09]Oh wow, nice.
[235:24.70]I'm almost dead.
[235:27.26]Thank you healbots for keeping me alive.
[235:30.86]How many do you have?
[235:33.40]I think they're yours.
[235:34.50]I think they're like ours.
[235:36.04]I have three.
[235:38.36]Yeah, all three of them can heal me as well as you.
[235:42.30]Do the heals crit?
[235:43.44]That'd be cool.
[235:48.21]Where are we at?
[235:49.25]87?
[235:49.31]Alright, now we got money.
[235:53.95]We just went right through this, man.
[235:55.33]No enemies.
[235:56.25]So we can spend some time here after this.
[235:58.07]That was a good idea.
[235:58.93]Yeah.
[236:02.24]Alright, I left your boss item.
[236:05.28]And we each have like 1,600 bucks.
[236:07.82]Okay, boss item is... What is it?
[236:11.06]Another fuel cell.
[236:12.06]God.
[236:16.64]Alright.
[236:17.84]What do we want to buy?
[236:19.26]I don't know.
[236:21.06]It's like being a kid at the toy store.
[236:24.64]The whole map is available.
[236:28.47]Okay.
[236:29.13]Four rose bucklers right now.
[236:32.09]Does a missile drone follow you, or is it stationary?
[236:35.28]Like, is it worth picking this up for the future, or... Um, I don't know.
[236:39.86]I know the gunner follows you.
[236:41.28]I assume it follows you.
[236:43.76]Damn it.
[236:44.84]So we'll get another drone.
[236:46.81]I'll spend my money on a... Stun grenade.
[236:49.71]A co-op.
[236:52.41]Damn it.
[236:54.03]Damn it!
[236:59.84]Yeah, only the turrets follow, okay.
[237:03.39]Sunk cost fallacy.
[237:04.84]I know.
[237:05.98]I know.
[237:06.50]What is the sunk?
[237:07.84]I lost all my money gambling.
[237:11.36]It's gone.
[237:11.86]You have 400?
[237:12.64]Oh, well.
[237:13.56]Wait, hold on.
[237:14.22]I might be able to... Whoops.
[237:16.30]Come on.
[237:17.74]Come on!
[237:18.26]176.
[237:18.28]180.
[237:19.73]There's so many... I'm so stupid.
[237:24.37]Why did I gamble?
[237:25.19]I shouldn't have gambled.
[237:27.93]I should not have done that.
[237:29.66]How much is it to gamble more?
[237:31.34]Like 500-something dollars.
[237:33.46]There's two boxes right here, like in between there.
[237:38.72]It makes you feel better.
[237:41.40]I gambled and won on the first try.
[237:43.14]Yeah, because I'm the old person that sat down and spent like $5,000 here.
[237:46.88]That wasn't the $500 one.
[237:47.70]That was the $150 one.
[237:48.36]None of these I can... $450... Ugh.
[237:58.24]One Lunar Coin?
[237:59.00]Look, these minimums are too high.
[238:00.40]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[238:02.81]We gotta go to some different tables.
[238:05.69]There's so many boxes here that I could've opened at least two or three more boxes.
[238:08.79]I'm so upset with myself.
[238:14.41]Uh, what's this blue portal?
[238:16.31]I can win it back, just you wait.
[238:18.55]Do you hit the blue portal or the teleporter, chat?
[238:20.86]Blue portal.
[238:26.08]Stay alive for 30 minutes.
[238:28.80]Blue portal?
[238:30.64]The portal goes to a shop world.
[238:32.26]We just spent all of our money.
[238:33.48]What?
[238:35.66]Let's go to the shop world and at least see the new stuff.
[238:40.61]I have a hundred... Well, we don't have any money.
[238:46.27]Do not do blue yet.
[238:48.23]Somebody just said in all caps.
[238:49.95]Well, we're not... We don't have to buy anything here.
[238:51.42]We can look.
[238:52.38]I just fell down the... What's happening?
[238:53.72]I fell off the fucking mountain.
[238:54.76]What happened?
[238:55.80]Hello?
[238:56.08]Hi.
[238:58.43]You okay down there?
[238:59.27]I don't know.
[238:59.73]I just went off.
[239:00.59]Do I have to go down?
[239:02.39]Am I never going to be able to come back up?
[239:06.66]I don't know.
[239:07.48]They didn't think about that when they made this game 3D apparently.
[239:11.30]They're like, what if somebody falls?
[239:13.38]Well, it just like spawned me and I just moved for a second.
[239:16.72]Well, you can like, can you die and you can just spectate me?
[239:19.42]Because there's a bunch of stuff people in chat do not want me to buy that cost lunar coins.
[239:24.67]Okay, I technically should have probably, where am I now?
[239:28.73]Okay.
[239:30.41]Reforge items.
[239:31.93]I'm back.
[239:35.45]So we can forge.
[239:36.29]Do we have to fight this guy?
[239:38.79]Hold on.
[239:39.19]Is this the character?
[239:40.43]He has a health bar.
[239:41.83]Is this the character in the ice right here with the 10 lunar coins?
[239:44.59]I think you have to have 10 lunar to unlock this character.
[239:47.42]This character?
[239:49.12]Yeah, on the right.
[239:51.66]He's right where he says 10 lunar and he's in a block of ice.
[239:56.20]What about the dragon?
[239:59.13]The dragon is like, he's selling him.
[240:00.91]He's like the slaver.
[240:02.11]Reforge.
[240:03.17]Five items.
[240:04.53]Dare you.
[240:06.05]No.
[240:07.27]Why would I do that?
[240:08.51]Is it still counting?
[240:09.27]Why is it counting the shop?
[240:11.95]Uh-oh.
[240:12.47]I'm coming for you.
[240:13.49]This shouldn't be counting in the shop.
[240:15.09]Time should freeze.
[240:15.97]The whole game is time.
[240:17.03]There's one big stopwatch.
[240:23.62]No, I can't.
[240:24.26]I was going to do one shot and then run.
[240:31.14]Alright, we're going back.
[240:32.00]This is all too confusing for us at the moment.
[240:35.34]We, apparently, it's bad to buy anything with Lunar Coins until you get the Lunar character.
[240:40.47]So we shouldn't buy anything until we actually get to unlock the guy in the ice.
[240:47.39]Alright, we have cycled, right?
[240:49.41]Technically.
[240:50.77]So that's like the kind of goal right now is Lunar Coins.
[240:53.49]Right.
[240:55.10]So stop missing them.
[240:58.14]Basically.
[241:00.49]This game's going to feel so much worse later when we don't crit every single attack.
[241:05.35]I'm just realizing this now.
[241:07.09]What, that we've completely ruined the game?
[241:08.91]We've ruined the game for ourselves.
[241:12.52]There's a jellyfish boss just hanging out over there.
[241:14.20]I guess the first level enemies are going to feel so easy that it's like we have permacrits, right?
[241:24.38]Something like that.
[241:27.14]Doesn't he do the big explosion thing?
[241:29.26]Yes.
[241:30.46]We need to be aware of that.
[241:31.93]We might just kill him first, though.
[241:34.01]Oh, it's happening now.
[241:42.27]Alright, we did it!
[241:42.91]700 bucks.
[241:43.15]Damn.
[241:43.25]Too bad all the chests are, like, 350.
[241:44.61]Let's go on a goddamn opening spree.
[241:48.19]Another healing drone.
[241:58.03]Question mark or bombs on enemies?
[242:03.14]I'll go bombs.
[242:07.76]Dude, I'm just a healer.
[242:09.28]I marked the teleporter.
[242:12.80]For future reference.
[242:13.88]Okay, let's start opening boxes.
[242:16.02]No, another one.
[242:16.90]Should I... Is it... Should I just have like ten healing drones?
[242:23.87]I will never die.
[242:25.01]I'm gonna do it.
[242:33.78]I have too many healing drones.
[242:35.06]Let's fight.
[242:41.64]I am over by the teleporter when you want to go.
[242:45.06]Yeah, I'm coming over here now.
[242:46.14]Yeah, let's just do it.
[242:47.46]Might as well.
[242:49.44]Get it going.
[242:52.68]There's another heal drone here.
[242:55.16]I have one, two, three, four, five.
[242:58.08]I have five.
[242:59.36]Do I have six healing drones?
[243:02.29]I have a lot.
[243:03.07]Let's put it that way.
[243:03.59]Well, I got another one.
[243:04.87]Alright, good.
[243:07.09]We've got a full party on the left.
[243:08.87]I don't think they're even on the screen anymore because there's too many of them.
[243:11.56]Alright, what's it going to be?
[243:15.46]I can't even count how many drunks we have.
[243:17.60]How many?
[243:18.14]Two, three, four.
[243:19.82]Oh, he's dying.
[243:28.89]Real fast.
[243:29.47]I'll take the one on the left.
[243:32.61]Alright, let's see who can kill him faster.
[243:34.05]It's gonna be you.
[243:42.72]Mine's dead.
[243:45.82]That, like, rapid... Okay, we got a lot of fucking of these... Hold on.
[243:50.94]I can't suck them out of their little tubes?
[243:54.93]I could stay invisible for so long.
[243:56.41]They're going all the way across the map.
[244:02.83]Alright, the bosses are dead, now I just have to not... Give me the... Give me this!
[244:07.07]What's wrong with me?
[244:07.85]Found a coin.
[244:14.82]Wow.
[244:19.10]Alright, we got money.
[244:19.88]Well, we're pretty good at this game now, and I want to savor this moment.
[244:23.46]Savor the moment of the fact that this is probably the only run where we're going to be able to do this more than once.
[244:27.59]Be like gods.
[244:31.28]This is like when you finally get that Isaac run, where you just walk into the room, you push the fire button, and everything dies.
[244:38.04]Kind of.
[244:38.86]Did you, uh, did I get, uh, did you pick up the item?
[244:42.22]Nope.
[244:42.98]Okay, I get it.
[244:44.34]I forget if I, wait, did I?
[244:46.18]Maybe not, but you, actually, you know what, you should be picking, if there's, like, damage items, they should be going to you.
[244:52.86]If I'm completely honest.
[244:53.50]Well, the Bandolier is just ammo pack to reset cooldowns, which is more your... Yeah, but I mean... I kind of just do DPS.
[245:00.22]But if there are, like, do more damage to boss, if those bullets show up, then you should be taking them.
[245:08.55]I'm invisible for so long after damaging all the heal bots swirling around this chaos.
[245:13.29]I love it.
[245:14.63]Alright, let's go loot.
[245:15.21]Time to loot.
[245:17.57]I will go the other way.
[245:23.25]Oh.
[245:24.49]Five Bucklers that reduce damage while sprinting is pretty cool.
[245:31.25]Anybody see anything?
[245:33.26]Shrine of Chance.
[245:37.26]I had to do it.
[245:37.80]I did.
[245:39.84]Sorry.
[245:46.61]Move faster out of combat.
[245:47.73]I think I already have a couple of these.
[245:50.01]I also got that.
[245:54.95]This is very fast.
[245:59.83]Can't lose them all.
[246:03.82]Going for broke at the casino.
[246:08.02]Me too.
[246:18.60]I got a fucking... What is... Okay, what is going on?
[246:22.46]Who's dropping... Who is dropping this shit all over me?
[246:25.15]Okay.
[246:33.69]Alright, I activated another drone for fun, so that's all my money.
[246:38.87]I got faster sprint.
[246:40.69]Ready?
[246:41.37]I'm ready.
[246:41.77]Did you hear that squeak?
[246:43.30]Yeah, what was that?
[246:44.90]It's like the soft landing.
[246:48.35]I think chance to block incoming damage teddy bears.
[246:50.71]People are throwing rocks down at us.
[246:52.59]Yeah, I thought I just died.
[246:53.89]This game is just laughing its ass off at us.
[247:02.94]It is.
[247:04.46]It's going to have to send enemies with enough HP that it's okay if they get crit every single time.
[247:15.47]What we got in here?
[247:17.23]None of these are worth it.
[247:20.25]We're at a casino over here.
[247:23.81]No, we do not dare activate the scary thing, right?
[247:28.82]No, no way.
[247:30.40]Probably not.
[247:34.08]I mean, we could.
[247:34.94]No.
[247:35.46]No, this is such a good run.
[247:39.80]Just play it safe.
[247:41.04]We need to play this safe.
[247:41.86]We have to try to get high.
[247:43.50]As high as we can.
[247:45.73]That hurt.
[247:46.33]Well, we're in the right city to do that.
[247:51.35]If I didn't have the heavy damage thing, that probably would have been an instant kill.
[247:55.62]I would have died.
[247:58.22]Alright, we've got 400.
[247:59.00]What's in here?
[248:01.42]The unknown.
[248:02.54]The unknown.
[248:03.70]Sure.
[248:03.88]It's gasoline.
[248:05.88]Gasoline.
[248:13.02]Man, the gambling is getting significantly more expensive.
[248:17.68]Yeah, it is.
[248:20.16]The super crates are almost a thousand each.
[248:24.34]Uh, the teleporter's over here.
[248:28.52]This way.
[248:32.92]We can activate it.
[248:34.92]If you'd like to do it and then run around.
[248:37.26]But, ah, there's like a fire elite enemy over here that's gonna be a big pain in the ass.
[248:41.26]Hold on.
[248:42.91]I just want to open one of these boxes, then I'll be ready.
[248:48.09]Yeah, this guy right here is gonna die.
[248:57.50]Okay.
[248:59.18]I'm ready.
[248:59.82]This, like, fire... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[249:02.28]Oh, I'm dead instantly!
[249:03.06]Holy shit, I'm dead instantly.
[249:04.92]Oh, wow.
[249:06.34]Okay.
[249:06.86]Yeah, that was a 100% health kill.
[249:09.10]Did you come back to life?
[249:10.02]Yeah, I had the item that maybe brought me back.
[249:12.48]You gotta kill, we gotta kill that fire thing.
[249:15.16]Jesus.
[249:15.80]I ain't fucking around with that anymore.
[249:24.20]Dude.
[249:27.34]Bye.
[249:29.08]Just, oh my god!
[249:31.18]Look at this AoE.
[249:32.72]Are you dead again?
[249:33.50]Yeah.
[249:34.76]Oh my god.
[249:38.56]Fire guy's dead.
[249:40.14]Yeah.
[249:41.56]I'm gone.
[249:41.94]Got melted.
[249:42.60]Alright, so I guess I should just activate the thing.
[249:46.43]Where is it?
[249:47.29]You might as well just activate it.
[249:49.37]Oh, you have 1200 health.
[249:50.47]That's right.
[249:50.83]Yeah, because that thing was one hit killing me.
[250:00.99]Where is it?
[250:02.31]I think it's below you.
[250:04.65]It's like to the bottom left below.
[250:06.15]Yeah, down there.
[250:06.67]It's like underneath there.
[250:11.61]So much garbage.
[250:13.00]Is that fire guy still alive?
[250:17.56]Maybe.
[250:17.92]It might be able to do it.
[250:18.76]You have like 100% crits.
[250:20.32]It's possible.
[250:27.00]Oh my god.
[250:31.46]Do the drones stay, right?
[250:32.88]So all the drones that were purchased get to stick around?
[250:40.02]I spent my whole life savings on all these healing drones.
[250:42.18]I hope they help you.
[250:47.62]Can I go under here?
[250:49.26]No.
[250:49.56]Too thick.
[251:01.93]Holy shit.
[251:03.16]58.
[251:03.42]You're doing like 600 damage a shot with that thing?
[251:08.24]Wow.
[251:16.31]You might actually do this if you... I mean, it's at 36%.
[251:18.75]It's gonna be hard, but... It is very possible.
[251:26.61]If you just kill both bosses and just... Oh...
[251:31.65]There's three!
[251:37.68]You do so much fucking damage, though.
[251:39.54]You really do.
[251:42.00]I don't have any more healers!
[251:45.90]They're just spawning so many around me!
[251:47.64]Yeah, they're... They're... The drone army is being depleted.
[251:51.69]There's only... There's three... Well, two healing drones.
[251:53.87]The drone army is gone.
[251:56.09]Two left.
[251:57.69]Out of, uh... Like, twelve.
[252:03.72]I'll just go this way and cruise for a minute, if that's cool.
[252:08.68]Gonna hang out over here on the lovely side of the map.
[252:12.17]You had, like, 20 health.
[252:14.41]You leveled up.
[252:15.09]Why would... Yeah, but... Oh my god.
[252:17.87]Oh, hi.
[252:22.18]Oh, if only he had some slugs.
[252:24.16]He'd be doing just fine.
[252:25.10]If only I had any healing survivability whatsoever.
[252:31.85]There are two healing drones somewhere, apparently.
[252:33.81]Are they, like, stuck somewhere?
[252:36.05]Because they have full health.
[252:49.60]We knew it was coming.
[252:50.66]Yeah.
[252:52.02]We knew it was coming.
[252:58.42]That was still pretty good.
[252:59.96]That was so fun, yeah.
[253:01.36]We made the loop.
[253:06.55]So how do we unlock the other three characters?
[253:09.79]Let's take a look at the main menu.
[253:10.97]Yeah, let's see.
[253:11.65]Because we got one of them.
[253:17.59]Complete 30 stages is the other one.
[253:20.72]We should be on the way.
[253:23.64]requires pause what the hell is obliterate yourself at the obelisk mean okay I'm gonna have to mute for a second because uh what's wrong mute for a second what is oh is he gone uh but uh does it what does that mean what does that mean what do you do you have to get to stage seven to spawn a portal
[253:53.21]You unlock four of them by just playing normally.
[253:54.85]The other two require you to spend ten lunar coins and get to stage seven.
[253:58.41]Okay.
[254:00.75]Obliterate is completing a run.
[254:05.46]Were we just on level seven?
[254:13.26]You kill yourself in a portal.
[254:14.49]Oh, okay.
[254:14.89]That was six.
[254:23.89]We should do this pretty soon, though.
[254:25.25]I wish it showed you how many you've done.
[254:35.23]Can I see that information?
[254:44.19]Defeat the Teleporter boss in under 15 seconds.
[254:48.64]Uh, there's more page?
[254:51.38]Oh.
[254:53.55]Defeat 3,000 enemies and reach 300% move speed.
[254:57.63]Some crazy things are... Crazy things are happening.
[255:00.85]Yeah.
[255:04.13]What, are you good?
[255:04.71]What happened?
[255:07.13]Um... Somebody just misclicked.
[255:09.77]And, uh... Gave 100 gif subs.
[255:12.97]Oh.
[255:16.91]100 subs.
[255:20.58]Good.
[255:21.08]Nice.
[255:21.96]Holy shit, that's fucking crazy.
[255:25.90]A hundred!
[255:27.18]A hundred!
[255:29.74]I can't refund.
[255:31.56]They're mine now.
[255:37.52]Complete 30 stages, so we're... We'll probably get this 30 stage thing.
[255:46.58]Uh, probably next.
[255:50.08]Or one or two more.
[255:52.00]Maybe.
[255:59.66]Etalyx has asked you to play Risk of Rain.
[256:02.97]I'll try.
[256:03.49]I'll try it.
[256:04.43]I've heard it was pretty fun.
[256:16.26]Alright.
[256:18.56]I'm gonna... Yeah, I'm gonna stay.
[256:25.42]I'll stay.
[256:28.58]decline decline it who should I be um I just don't I don't I'm not a big fan of the default character I like the default weapon but I don't like the move set yeah I enjoyed getting super crits as multi but um we could do double huntress
[256:56.53]Probably not a big deal.
[256:58.09]I haven't played Huntress in a while.
[257:01.85]I would like to try it.
[257:05.11]Yeah, let's do double Hunter.
[257:06.33]Okay.
[257:10.39]Alright.
[257:12.03]Let's... Let's go.
[257:25.46]Hurt yourself shrine.
[257:26.24]Got it.
[257:29.04]39 dollars.
[257:31.17]Boxes.
[257:31.69]Quick.
[257:38.51]Come on.
[257:38.85]Somebody.
[257:39.95]Enemies.
[257:52.46]Die.
[257:53.20]Got it.
[258:00.40]27 30 Oh air shot what the fuck was that?
[258:22.39]Nice aim
[258:29.70]Alright.
[258:30.84]There's two more over here.
[258:37.77]Why am I not doing a facecam?
[258:39.67]I don't do facecam.
[258:41.71]I do facecam, like, sometimes.
[258:43.51]I don't do facecam.
[258:45.23]I really haven't been doing it much this stream either.
[258:48.43]Games like this aren't really good for it.
[258:50.55]Because you're like, your tongue is being chewed between your teeth and you're like, we're trying hard.
[258:55.97]Yeah, you just like, you're mashing down on your tongue.
[258:58.88]You guys want to see me just fucking chewing on my tongue?
[259:01.44]No.
[259:05.72]I'm gonna be lying to you.
[259:07.34]I don't, I don't really do facecam.
[259:09.24]I do it sometimes.
[259:14.07]That's not a lie.
[259:15.79]That is a truth.
[259:16.41]Alright, we probably, uh, let's get this started.
[259:25.77]Probably for the best.
[259:27.77]Damn it, that's a drone.
[259:34.82]55!
[259:35.10]Ah!
[259:37.14]Come here.
[259:43.10]Alright, let's do it.
[259:46.64]Is it right there?
[259:51.01]Oh, Jesus.
[259:51.63]What the hell happened here?
[260:02.38]He's having a bad hair day.
[260:07.79]The joke there is every day is a bad hair day, right?
[260:15.69]So, we ready?
[260:16.73]I'm ready, I'm turning it on.
[260:19.33]Alright, let's do it.
[260:21.05]It is... Jellyfish!
[260:32.46]Kind of a bad place.
[260:33.82]Yeah, well, it's just a bad... It's a bad enemy for us because we can't use our fourth... Does this count as line of sight?
[260:40.57]I don't think arrows hit, right?
[260:42.75]No, they do.
[260:44.29]They do.
[260:46.43]I hope these count as line of sight.
[260:57.93]You doing it?
[260:58.76]Woo!
[261:01.04]No!
[261:04.23]Don't do it, don't do it.
[261:05.95]Yeah, the mouse 2 for this class is amazing.
[261:08.73]Uh-oh.
[261:14.20]Thought he was doing the super.
[261:15.54]That didn't hit it?
[261:17.72]In what world are you doing it?
[261:19.52]This is the super.
[261:21.82]That almost insta-kills me.
[261:31.85]That's good.
[261:35.36]What did he drop?
[261:36.22]What the hell is this?
[261:39.10]They're kind of in weird spots, aren't they?
[261:42.06]They're just like hanging out up here.
[261:53.89]That guy's too far away.
[261:54.67]I don't care about him.
[261:57.59]What about any more boxes?
[262:05.07]Yeah, we killed him pretty slowly.
[262:26.19]Where are the boxes for this particular one?
[262:30.66]Down this way.
[262:31.16]I mean, we're on 95.
[262:32.68]Philip, why is this taking so long?
[262:34.74]Are we just so good at killing the boss, I guess?
[262:37.00]Are we not just standing in the teleporter the whole time?
[262:39.98]I feel like we've been here for way too long.
[262:49.20]There's so many stationary turrets on this one.
[263:01.26]and nothing to spend.
[263:03.50]Yeah, we just gotta go.
[263:04.90]I'm ready to hit it.
[263:05.46]You ready?
[263:05.72]Uh, one sec.
[263:09.53]Coin!
[263:10.31]Where's the coin?
[263:14.07]Coin!
[263:15.29]Do coins spawn randomly or is there like one on every level?
[263:18.54]I don't know.
[263:20.62]I feel like it's random.
[263:31.40]We're gonna be in medium on the second level.
[263:33.32]Yeah, I think I've spent as much as I can.
[263:34.82]We get two of the kind of slowest damage characters.
[263:40.94]We might get screwed here.
[263:42.90]Yeah.
[263:43.96]DPS a little low.
[263:45.06]We're going to the desert though.
[263:47.28]Abandoned aqueduct.
[263:50.91]Is that a hurt yourself item?
[263:57.33]No, it's a fish item.
[263:58.19]What's a fish do?
[263:59.87]Combat.
[264:00.41]Nope.
[264:11.55]$67.
[264:11.57]Such a vast landscape.
[264:12.71]And no money.
[264:16.59]Alright.
[264:43.29]Give me something.
[265:09.28]I feel like this takes forever to kill anything.
[265:14.10]We really did spoil ourselves so bad.
[265:16.78]Critting every single time, and then just like... One, two, three, four, five.
[265:25.85]Dead.
[265:30.57]A lot of enemies over here.
[265:31.40]Alright, I've got money now.
[265:40.14]Can I buy something?
[265:44.04]Ooh, what is the Bottle Flame?
[265:47.50]Too expensive is what it is.
[265:58.03]Okay, do you get the impression that some of these maps are way too big?
[266:02.01]Sometimes, yeah.
[266:03.85]I feel like these maps in particular are just enormous.
[266:08.79]And it doesn't really add anything.
[266:17.13]Um, well, it's probably a time thing, right?
[266:19.55]They make it bigger because they want you to spend more time on this area.
[266:23.81]I guess.
[266:25.45]Trying to figure out where to go.
[266:26.63]Uh, any sign of the teleporter?
[266:47.13]Yes, I have a sign of the teleporter by me.
[266:48.93]I don't want that.
[266:51.48]I don't want any of those.
[267:01.47]Whenever I get, like, the bounce right click, it's like Jibalanka.
[267:04.15]This really is just smite.
[267:07.23]Welcome to smite.
[267:13.24]Uh, you ready for the teleporter?
[267:15.50]I guess, yeah.
[267:18.91]Kind of just hovering in its general area, looking for a last box or two.
[267:23.03]I still have money, but... There's a lot of secrets on higher areas of maps.
[267:31.38]Ah, I see.
[267:43.69]I'm at the TP.
[267:46.45]You seem to have spawned a Lunar Coin, which I grabbed.
[267:49.59]Ooh, good.
[267:51.11]How many do you have?
[267:52.69]I have four.
[267:54.13]Okay, so I have five.
[267:55.19]We're pretty much even.
[268:00.58]It's always this guy, huh?
[268:02.74]Apparently.
[268:09.96]Dying quicker than the last thing was.
[268:12.36]There's a big elite beetle next to you.
[268:14.07]Oof.
[268:14.65]Yes, there is.
[268:19.37]Oh, he's killing me, too.
[268:23.67]Where's my healer?
[268:24.48]Oh, god damn it.
[268:25.14]I thought he was... Yeah, there we go.
[268:26.02]I thought he was going to run towards me.
[268:45.54]Yeah, this guy refuses to die.
[268:50.42]They're nice and grouped up.
[268:51.16]Basically fighting two bosses.
[269:05.25]Get up there.
[269:12.42]That's the tether.
[269:13.50]Be careful.
[269:24.33]Almost got him.
[269:24.83]This game is just Kenshi with teleporter.
[269:41.27]It's what?
[269:41.75]Kenshi?
[269:47.77]Kenshi with teleport.
[269:49.01]I don't even know what that means.
[269:51.55]Is it because it's a desert?
[269:53.73]That has to be the reference.
[269:55.41]Are there any more boxes?
[269:56.89]Some lucky stones, I guess.
[270:04.22]That was a joke about another person's comparison.
[270:06.28]Oh, I see.
[270:14.98]I don't see anything over here.
[270:22.93]Nothing.
[270:24.85]If you have 242, it's almost a guaranteed lucky shrine up here.
[270:30.12]Almost guaranteed.
[270:31.34]I got 700.
[270:31.94]I'll try.
[270:33.00]I'll give it a whirl.
[270:38.31]Nope.
[270:41.13]Hey, I got an extra jump.
[270:43.83]Ho-poo feather.
[270:55.95]Attack speed, good.
[270:56.91]Is this one 60?
[270:57.37]Come on.
[270:59.35]Yes.
[271:00.28]Let me know when you're ready because I spent all my money gambling.
[271:04.48]I am ready.
[271:05.06]I have two of those bucklers.
[271:12.84]So is that just straight up like 10% damage reduction?
[271:16.14]20%?
[271:18.08]I don't know.
[271:18.48]It's a chance.
[271:21.30]It just says reduces while sprinting.
[271:22.92]I don't know what the percentage is.
[271:35.54]127.
[271:35.70]Yeah, we have such little DPS.
[271:38.76]Yeah, we're already on hard.
[271:43.40]I want to get that other character, though.
[271:45.76]Yeah, we just have to complete stages, right?
[271:47.72]I guess, yeah.
[271:49.02]We have to be close.
[271:54.27]We were at least 70 plus percent of the way there.
[271:59.69]Could you see how many we completed in the log?
[272:02.84]There's no number, but it's a bar.
[272:05.90]I see.
[272:06.18]What do I got?
[272:11.40]Money?
[272:14.43]So I just need to stay sprinting the entire time.
[272:16.39]It's kind of hard to aim when you do that, though.
[272:32.54]We beat 30 total levels.
[272:34.02]I wonder what... Jesus.
[272:37.38]I wonder how far we are.
[272:39.66]We're probably at like 28.
[272:52.92]Noooo!
[272:53.88]Bad.
[272:54.50]Oh god.
[272:54.97]How did I end up in here?
[272:58.70]Where are you?
[273:00.16]Oh, there we go.
[273:00.94]I'm going to get stuffed inside of that thing.
[273:08.88]Opening a chest will launch fireworks.
[273:11.72]Oh, okay.
[273:18.32]I'm getting killed here.
[273:19.30]I'm going to get the hell out of here.
[273:28.77]There we go.
[273:33.71]The fireworks is actually kind of cool.
[273:41.85]Even the little money chest, huh?
[273:43.41]That's crazy.
[273:43.91]What the hell is on the ground here?
[273:46.43]Okay, like 10 monster or environment logs.
[273:51.98]Good job.
[273:52.72]I feel like I'm getting destroyed.
[273:56.18]You look like you're getting destroyed.
[273:57.46]I'm just getting hammered.
[274:01.36]I'm kind of leaving you alone, so it's also my fault.
[274:13.48]But there's stuff up here that I need.
[274:15.50]I have enough money to open something.
[274:28.44]This is a big map, isn't it?
[274:30.36]Just keeps going and going.
[274:37.43]Alright, I'm gambling again.
[274:39.03]I'm going for it.
[274:39.59]I'm gonna do it.
[274:41.67]Ready?
[274:41.93]Told you.
[274:55.16]Did you get it?
[274:55.98]I did.
[275:01.97]Alright, we gotta... We gotta go.
[275:04.41]We're gonna die at this boss.
[275:05.81]This boss is gonna fucking destroy us.
[275:09.43]Yes.
[275:12.13]I cannot deny it, but I did find the, uh, the spot.
[275:15.73]At least I have equipment, yeah.
[275:19.49]You ready?
[275:21.20]Uh, where is the... Oh, it's over there by you.
[275:24.84]I was just over there.
[275:34.08]Yeah, we're in very hard mode now, into uncharted territory.
[275:38.34]Yeah.
[275:48.62]So what is the red down arrow?
[275:52.52]Is it stun or slow?
[275:59.06]I think the red downer was attack down, maybe?
[276:01.32]Or slow, yeah.
[276:03.18]Maybe.
[276:03.54]I don't know.
[276:08.98]Alright, let's do it.
[276:10.38]Pump it up.
[276:11.51]Might as well.
[276:12.91]Let's... spawn the... It's the imp.
[276:18.53]The imp?
[276:19.19]Oh, it's slow, apparently.
[276:20.67]Slow.
[276:20.93]He's the teleporter.
[276:22.55]Oh, shit.
[276:23.17]Oh, that's a lot of people.
[276:32.75]So many lasers pointing across every direction.
[276:34.48]It's also difficult for the Huntress to get kills because of the auto-aim if any enemies get in between.
[276:39.28]Yeah.
[276:40.80]It's easy.
[276:44.32]You do have that really good AOE, though.
[276:46.93]Yeah.
[276:47.19]It'd be very helpful.
[276:49.61]And you can sprint faster than these, like, robot lasers can catch up to you.
[276:57.40]Pretty much just sprint, circle, shoot.
[277:04.55]Aw, dammit.
[277:14.08]Yeah, we're doing so little damage, it's funny.
[277:19.22]No!
[277:19.38]Well, they're almost not spawning anymore, so that's good.
[277:23.60]Yeah, I mean, the teleport is almost 99, then we just have to defeat the boss, so... Should be doable.
[277:45.54]Some of these balls running around, okay nine nine God damn always right when I do the AOE teleport.
[277:57.01]Oh
[278:15.71]We're like at the halfway point.
[278:18.41]It's like half dead.
[278:23.19]Our basic attacks is so pitiful.
[278:27.79]Bop, need to bop, bop.
[278:29.87]Character need to bop, bop.
[278:40.26]Did he go all the way across the map?
[278:43.85]He's all the way down here.
[278:45.35]He went all the way down here.
[278:47.11]Time is still ticking, too.
[278:51.11]Wait.
[278:51.52]Teleporting back.
[278:52.34]Is he coming back?
[278:55.58]Hey, teleporting bosses.
[278:56.90]Gotta love them.
[279:00.18]What?
[279:02.28]Oh, there he is.
[279:03.46]He just kind of fell.
[279:17.67]Die.
[279:26.63]Yeah, double AoE doesn't mean a whole lot right now.
[279:28.89]No, not really.
[279:32.32]Really?
[279:32.66]With 75 left?
[279:33.20]Kind of back to hell.
[279:36.70]Alright, to be honest, we should just go.
[279:38.36]Alright, you get both of those.
[279:41.60]Why?
[279:41.80]I don't know.
[279:44.56]Because you have two of them already.
[279:47.03]Just get it.
[279:47.37]That's something that does explosions, right?
[279:50.93]Detonate on kill, yeah.
[279:51.93]Yeah, you get three of them now.
[279:53.81]Okay, so there you go.
[279:55.17]Yeah, so now you get three.
[279:59.73]Are we going to stick around to loot, or do we pretty much get everything?
[280:03.21]I think we have solidified the fact that we're going to lose.
[280:06.44]So I would say we should probably just complete it and try to complete the next one and, you know, try to unlock the other character.
[280:15.34]That's what I would say.
[280:18.32]Okay, well I found a couple boxes.
[280:20.40]You can tell me when you want me to press the button.
[280:22.96]Go ahead.
[280:33.35]We are going to be an insane.
[280:34.75]No, not yet.
[280:38.89]On the next thing we do, we're going to get it.
[280:45.19]What are you talking about?
[280:46.63]On the next character.
[280:47.99]On the next thing, we're going to get it.
[280:49.93]On the next cycle, we should get the new character.
[280:54.42]Oh, was that the 30th stage?
[280:57.12]Not that one, but we're very, very, very close.
[281:05.84]Huntress is worst class in my humble opinion.
[281:08.38]Pretty good.
[281:08.72]Doesn't sound humble.
[281:19.21]Huntress seems like a really good class to not both be at the same time, so I learned my lesson.
[281:26.39]Maybe.
[281:27.49]Seems like a great support.
[281:30.14]Doesn't seem like a main yet.
[281:38.04]I think we need to unlock more items.
[281:39.68]I think we need more cabbages.
[281:44.16]You say cabbages?
[281:45.12]We need more cabbages.
[281:54.95]every class, but the Huntress is the worst class.
[281:58.04]I'm gonna sneeze and I have no way to mute, I'm so sorry!
[282:06.93]Again?
[282:07.35]Sneezes always come in pairs, though.
[282:15.03]They do, and you're right, because here comes another one.
[282:18.84]I can't.
[282:21.38]I can't.
[282:22.50]I'm trying to eat it.
[282:23.30]I can't.
[282:24.48]It's hard to eat a sneeze.
[282:25.56]I can't kill anything!
[282:41.65]There's no enemies.
[282:43.05]Character need a buff!
[282:53.11]It happened.
[282:53.51]It worked.
[282:54.91]Ooh, it worked.
[282:56.94]They heard my cries.
[283:01.26]Whoops, wrong buttons.
[283:02.20]Those are all the wrong buttons.
[283:03.48]Well, that's a big guy.
[283:04.48]Whoa, you go, big guy!
[283:07.91]I'm gonna come back and help you.
[283:13.87]I try to get away.
[283:21.74]Post for the fans.
[283:22.78]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[283:33.85]I'm dead.
[283:34.45]I'm dead.
[283:35.13]Oh, you're dead?
[283:35.65]No, I'm alive.
[283:36.45]I'm alive.
[283:37.39]I live.
[283:39.53]Which one is it?
[283:40.59]I live.
[283:42.21]Probably not for long, though.
[283:52.20]Hey!
[283:53.90]More firework chests, huh?
[283:56.78]Kind of a weird focus that I have for this run.
[284:00.40]I open stuff good.
[284:01.56]Get away from me!
[284:04.28]Get away from me!
[284:06.10]What is that?
[284:06.56]3D glasses.
[284:14.76]Teleporter's over here.
[284:17.58]I wouldn't spawn any of that until this big guy's dead, though.
[284:21.28]Okay.
[284:22.90]Probably for the best.
[284:25.28]He is dead.
[284:25.86]Alright.
[284:27.84]I wouldn't spawn that until we're ready to grow.
[284:29.62]And we probably, we're an impossible.
[284:37.73]Alright, I'm ready.
[284:40.15]Impossible.
[284:42.27]Yes.
[284:43.15]So it says, but I don't believe it.
[284:45.19]Let's see if it's possible.
[284:48.30]Mega, oh, it's the Magma Wyrm.
[284:49.84]We haven't seen this in a while.
[284:55.25]Not sure whether to be thrilled or not.
[284:56.29]Ceremonial Dagger.
[284:56.93]Okay, I got Ceremonial Dagger.
[285:05.93]I'm going for ultimate crits.
[285:15.24]I can't even see what the fuck is going on.
[285:19.94]Honestly, I have no idea.
[285:20.72]All I know is that there's enemies.
[285:22.48]The whole screen is red and glowing.
[285:26.50]Sometimes I right click.
[285:39.65]Dude, we can beat this Magma Wyrm.
[285:40.93]It's really hard to do damage.
[285:48.43]Oh boy, big guy over on the left.
[285:50.91]He's here.
[285:51.27]He's here.
[285:53.39]Huge monster.
[285:54.43]A cyclops guy.
[286:04.03]So many boxes just sitting right up here, too.
[286:10.50]Trying to help with the Cyclops guy.
[286:12.76]Yeah.
[286:13.30]I'm dying.
[286:14.42]I'm invisible, so I'm gonna run.
[286:23.05]Too much.
[286:23.89]I think we'll get it.
[286:27.51]Yeah, I think we're gonna get it.
[286:28.91]We definitely got the 99%, so that's good.
[286:31.45]Now we just have to do Magma guy.
[286:34.39]No, don't jump up, please.
[286:43.68]I assume he's a lot harder in 3D than he is in 2D.
[286:48.16]So is this just a 3D reimagining of the first game?
[286:51.44]I believe yes.
[287:09.04]3D remake.
[287:13.61]My god, he's coming.
[287:17.73]Is he dead?
[287:18.91]He's like jumping higher.
[287:20.51]He's deciding to jump much higher.
[287:25.72]Now he's dead.
[287:26.12]There we go.
[287:27.42]Proceed through the teleporter.
[287:31.46]Uh, we did pretty well.
[287:32.28]Do you want to look for boxes?
[287:35.27]Let's look for boxes.
[287:37.29]Yeah!
[287:37.85]You want the beetle?
[287:38.61]Is it a beehive?
[287:39.49]Oh, I'm dead!
[287:40.95]I'm dead.
[287:41.29]I'm dead.
[287:41.55]Something's killing us.
[287:42.99]What's happening?
[287:43.67]This is my health pool.
[287:48.45]I'm dead.
[287:49.70]Well, thank you for donating your boss relic.
[287:52.62]You're welcome.
[287:54.86]See?
[287:56.04]I just got rained on.
[288:02.29]Isn't it these guys?
[288:03.45]It's these... There's mortar craps, apparently.
[288:10.71]Low enemies.
[288:13.81]I just got rained on.
[288:16.76]That is the rhythm.
[288:18.66]Right, chat.
[288:19.16]You're right.
[288:19.74]Good pun.
[288:20.46]Thanks.
[288:20.94]Apparently there's a legendary chest in the middle.
[288:24.46]In the middle.
[288:25.48]Find the middle.
[288:27.32]They have global range?
[288:40.68]The middle.
[288:44.38]Where?
[288:46.36]Was that it?
[288:52.76]Legendary chests cost $4,000.
[288:54.93]Well, we will be passing on that.
[288:57.59]We will not be doing that one.
[289:02.39]It's between two block structures in the ground level.
[289:10.06]uh cube or crits I'm gonna say cube maybe okay double crits let's go yeah teammates revive on the next floor no he's dead forever uninstall if you die again we are not friends
[289:41.10]weird that that also spawns missiles but I'm like a frost boy now those fireworks are cool I got frost relic killing enemies surrounds you with icicles every interactable spawns missiles that's fucking hilarious um is there a reason why I can't move what's going on okay that was weird
[290:17.31]My keyboard took a second to not lag.
[290:30.33]Well, that made quick work of them.
[290:41.24]Yeah, I have two active charges, I guess.
[290:43.22]You want to do a combat challenge over here?
[290:45.48]Yeah!
[290:48.09]Money.
[290:48.49]There's a guy.
[290:53.77]Ow, ow, ow.
[291:02.07]Heart.
[291:03.09]Pain.
[291:13.87]Missiles.
[291:14.69]I got a lot of money.
[291:19.46]That's what combat challenges are good for.
[291:21.24]That is so much money.
[291:25.24]$2,000 right now?
[291:26.86]That really wasn't a big deal at all.
[291:32.72]Teleporter is also here.
[291:42.93]We got gasoline.
[291:44.49]Ow!
[291:46.37]What the hell was that?
[291:48.78]Was the big guy?
[291:49.42]Move even faster.
[291:52.31]Probably not a bad turret spot.
[292:02.95]What is this 3D printer for?
[292:04.43]I don't know.
[292:06.09]More fireworks on interactables.
[292:08.76]Cool.
[292:16.14]I could open some more stuff, man.
[292:17.28]I got so much money.
[292:20.32]Some stuff over by me.
[292:22.12]Two-ish, three-ish chests.
[292:26.61]Ow, he can shoot backwards?
[292:27.91]That's not fair.
[292:29.39]Gasoline.
[292:36.75]Bleed.
[292:48.01]Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of fungus either.
[292:52.58]But extra damage to boxes is nice.
[292:54.28]I feel like there's a lot more chests here than there have been previously.
[293:02.96]Do you need an active?
[293:04.56]No, I got missiles.
[293:07.13]There's one.
[293:07.55]There's two right there, actually.
[293:08.87]I just need a box.
[293:13.11]Ow!
[293:13.29]Ow!
[293:19.98]Almost killed me.
[293:21.04]What is that?
[293:25.08]You guys ready for this?
[293:25.74]I am so spoiled by like this movement.
[293:32.01]How many of these do I have?
[293:32.65]Alright.
[293:38.61]I am ready.
[293:44.39]I'm just going with the speed.
[293:46.33]I'm going to do like 100% more faster speed.
[293:48.51]Wait, what is this?
[293:49.29]This is just... Oh, that's... Yeah, I have like three of those already.
[293:54.47]I'm going to get as many as I can.
[293:57.61]Oh, boy.
[293:57.99]I'm pretty happy at three.
[294:00.23]I'm going for like 100%.
[294:05.55]Speed build.
[294:06.43]Oh, my God.
[294:07.05]That is kind of insane.
[294:09.18]Only do I have six?
[294:10.50]Feels like using cheats.
[294:13.85]I'm gonna get 10.
[294:14.25]I just wanna see what it looks like.
[294:17.52]He's throwing.
[294:19.76]He's throwing.
[294:20.32]We're on haha difficulty.
[294:25.70]Alright, we gotta start this thing.
[294:29.07]One more.
[294:30.29]Alright, go ahead.
[294:30.83]You can start it.
[294:32.27]Hold on.
[294:32.75]I'm gonna give you a second to get over here.
[294:36.39]Shouldn't take me very long.
[294:38.72]True.
[294:39.00]Hi!
[294:44.62]Alright, we're in.
[294:53.97]We got some friends.
[294:57.27]We're doing good damage, though.
[294:59.83]This is actually kind of crazy.
[295:00.89]This is really fun.
[295:03.71]Whoops.
[295:07.31]Just run forever.
[295:09.43]Yeah, just try and outpace him.
[295:10.81]The lasers are still homing, though, which is kind of annoying.
[295:18.38]You can't even touch me!
[295:23.41]What?!
[295:24.71]Oh, that's bullshit!
[295:26.63]Dude, they stick right on your body no matter how fast you're going, you're right.
[295:34.62]I sent two orbs in there and just mass-killed everybody.
[295:46.31]The black hole arrow rain.
[295:47.79]Yeah, that was a sick multi-kill.
[296:00.71]I'm trying to freeze him.
[296:01.57]I don't know if you can freeze bosses, but I have a freeze aura.
[296:04.56]Freeze?
[296:08.74]God damn it, why?
[296:09.94]We're doing surprisingly well.
[296:14.12]I should be able to outrun that.
[296:24.14]Ouch, ouch, ouch.
[296:32.00]Ow, it hurts.
[296:32.40]I just took fall damage there.
[296:42.23]I can, like, not hurt anything, though.
[296:44.27]Oh, boy.
[296:48.10]Alright, 89% teleporter getting there.
[296:51.34]There's so many of them.
[296:53.48]There's so many of these guys.
[296:54.96]Oh, my God.
[296:55.78]Oh, yeah.
[296:56.00]There's a ton.
[296:58.50]Jesus.
[297:04.51]Oh, man.
[297:04.81]Trying to freeze them all.
[297:05.77]Oh, we got a blue portal, which apparently we don't need.
[297:09.31]Are they dead?
[297:11.59]Boss is dead.
[297:12.39]Teleporter is active.
[297:16.02]Did I pick up the boss loot already?
[297:17.46]What was the achievement we just got?
[297:20.74]There's another boss loot here.
[297:22.16]Uh, I didn't pick one up yet, I don't think.
[297:33.39]Yeah, I picked up Chronobobble 2.
[297:36.67]I don't know what that is.
[297:38.11]So, do we have enough to unlock this guy?
[297:40.29]There's a coin.
[297:41.65]Where's this coin?
[297:42.17]Alright, you got five?
[297:47.11]You got five coins, right?
[297:49.88]I have five coins.
[297:51.74]So you also have five coins?
[297:53.06]Yes.
[297:54.36]Cool.
[297:55.32]Alright.
[297:58.57]I don't think there's any more chests here, to be honest.
[298:00.83]I kind of went around the whole map.
[298:04.61]I have like 10,000 gold.
[298:06.87]Yeah.
[298:08.65]You each need 10.
[298:09.87]Oh, damn.
[298:12.11]Okay.
[298:13.65]There's some boxes back here.
[298:19.85]Oh, let's see if I can find any.
[298:23.00]Alright, we're gonna look.
[298:24.24]We're gonna check it out.
[298:31.46]I don't see anything.
[298:32.18]Alright, could try it.
[298:36.61]What is it?
[298:37.63]Something good.
[298:38.53]Cube.
[298:39.31]Ah!
[298:41.35]I like the missiles.
[298:54.57]I sound like a bunch of horses.
[299:02.03]I don't see anything else.
[299:09.51]I think we're good to leave.
[299:13.18]There is a way you can end a run after a loop.
[299:16.28]Interesting.
[299:18.00]You can leave whenever.
[299:18.88]We're going to get some levels, though.
[299:23.91]You should go on the portal or should we just leave?
[299:27.53]Probably just leave.
[299:28.29]Okay.
[299:30.53]Just go.
[299:31.21]Yeah, your move speed seems to make your teleporter, like your dash, go much further.
[299:38.34]So if you have 10 times move speed, then you've got to be teleporting like crazy.
[299:42.22]I think we just fucked ourselves.
[299:43.98]I think we were supposed to go on the portal for the win condition.
[299:46.80]Why?
[299:47.02]I think we can win, like end the run or something.
[299:50.40]Win...
[299:51.91]I thought that was the shop.
[299:53.79]We went there last time.
[299:54.57]Yeah, we did.
[299:55.11]It was a waste of time.
[299:55.81]Yeah, wait.
[299:56.81]Why is everybody freaking out?
[300:00.29]Last time, everyone said, don't go there.
[300:03.81]I'm just going to find the portal.
[300:05.01]I'll be portal finder.
[300:07.03]Okay.
[300:08.47]Or, I mean, the finder of... There's a boss over there.
[300:21.20]Found it.
[300:24.32]It is here.
[300:24.74]It is currently being guarded by... There's a giant jellyfish over here.
[300:28.14]I actually have decent attack speed now.
[300:31.42]Giant jellyfish, huh?
[300:32.85]There is a big jellyfish this way.
[300:43.58]Hello.
[300:43.78]Let me get some items.
[300:53.16]That's the slug.
[300:57.14]All chests are like $5.31.
[300:59.56]Very, very expensive.
[301:02.86]Do like one more chest and then open the Pandora's box.
[301:07.12]I'll help you with the jelly.
[301:08.86]Jellyfish.
[301:11.44]More equipment.
[301:24.52]Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.
[301:35.74]Fire!
[301:41.83]Yep.
[301:42.57]The burning ticking damage is like the worst offender out of everybody, I think.
[301:47.27]Yeah, the fire fire damage seems to be super super like over tuned.
[301:51.89]Yeah, you just die like in a second if you hit by fire.
[301:59.00]Uh oh.
[302:02.32]Uh oh.
[302:03.40]Wait, are we good?
[302:04.92]I think I missed it because I was in the air.
[302:08.52]I got caught out.
[302:14.53]This is not even the boss.
[302:16.21]No.
[302:18.55]Oh my god.
[302:21.81]Did I?
[302:22.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[302:23.83]Sorry, fire hit me.
[302:24.73]Oh, you're dead.
[302:25.72]I'm about to be dead.
[302:26.36]I think.
[302:34.24]I got hit by like two fire blasts and it was just like... Yeah, that fire damage is a ton.
[302:46.63]At least it got to be fast.
[302:47.67]That was fun.
[302:48.53]To run around like that.
[302:50.91]Again?
[302:51.17]Is this a line of sight?
[302:59.28]Alright.
[303:02.56]I guess I will try.
[303:04.65]Good luck.
[303:05.79]Just say we did it.
[303:06.73]Oh my god.
[303:18.56]I pressed the wrong buttons.
[303:29.28]Yeah, the beetle queen is really just a poison, but... You do have to fight all this junk.
[303:36.12]Yeah, like, I can't... Look at all those robots.
[303:38.30]Look at all this garbage.
[303:39.14]They can't even move this stuck.
[303:43.30]Okay, that was seriously like Diablo 3 level of numbers, let's be Frank.
[303:46.68]Yes.
[303:48.14]Accurate.
[303:52.50]Uh, people are saying, you have fungus, run away and regenerate if you get low.
[303:56.46]Um, okay.
[303:57.43]That, like, will do.
[303:58.71]Like, run away, like, far away.
[304:00.47]I don't know how accurate that is, but... Seems pretty accurate.
[304:20.12]We're doing it.
[304:20.76]Why is Etalyx doing so much more damage?
[304:22.98]Because I traded all of my items for boots to run 100% faster.
[304:28.48]And ran around in circles.
[304:30.60]I'm not done yet.
[304:33.58]Like, I haven't won yet, you know?
[304:42.92]Look at the little damage I do to this guy.
[304:49.05]There's like another boss that just spawned in.
[304:55.10]Okay, I guess I fly now.
[304:57.88]Yeah, wait.
[304:59.68]Are you invulnerable when you touch that teleporter?
[305:02.66]Or does everything have to be dead around here?
[305:05.48]Oh god.
[305:06.44]Oh boy.
[305:09.05]If you touch the portal, are you immune?
[305:10.61]Uh oh.
[305:17.95]I think you can touch it and run away, and it'll just port you wherever you are.
[305:28.11]Trying to heal.
[305:28.61]Oh, God.
[305:32.35]They found me, I guess.
[305:33.51]Yeah, you're not immune, but you can just run.
[305:46.45]The Wisp is so good with this many mobs.
[305:48.11]Yeah, that's why he has like three or four of them.
[305:52.66]What's the Wisp?
[305:53.68]The explosion thing, right?
[306:06.75]Yeah, just touch it and run.
[306:09.37]Touch what?
[306:10.19]Touch the teleporter and run.
[306:13.47]It'll just pull you out wherever you are.
[306:18.43]You know you might get one shot here.
[306:19.69]There you go, huh?
[306:21.49]There's like a small probability possibility of dying and we're back.
[306:25.53]Yeah What and you're almost dead?
[306:28.33]What's that?
[306:32.06]That wasn't fair you better run.
[306:34.06]What the fuck was that?
[306:36.64]Why is everyone into enemies?
[306:39.86]They were just sitting there waiting for us.
[306:41.26]Oh
[306:47.62]Alright, uh, we... We ain't gonna make it past this one.
[306:51.60]What's that thing?
[306:55.46]Uh, there's a big green... Oh, what is... No, that's just a guy.
[306:59.64]We are actually in hell now.
[307:01.36]Yeah, we kind of are.
[307:12.05]Well... I want this box.
[307:17.06]Yeah, now there's just bosses in the level with us, naturally.
[307:22.11]Like, from the beginning.
[307:28.45]What'd I get?
[307:28.85]I already have that.
[307:30.71]700 bucks, huh?
[307:36.28]If we make it past this level, I'm dead.
[307:39.60]If we make it past this level, I'm dead.
[307:43.16]I can't do that.
[307:47.85]What the hell killed me?
[307:58.70]Was fire?
[308:04.63]Sprint faster.
[308:06.87]Well, what do I have to lose, right?
[308:08.67]Alright, burn the boss.
[308:13.23]There's only going to be like six of them, don't worry.
[308:15.72]There's only one, two, three, four, five.
[308:17.68]There's only five of them, don't worry.
[308:20.72]Not to mention the one that was already there.
[308:29.97]Okay, hold on a minute.
[308:39.84]How are you as fast as I was?
[308:42.76]Because I have three of the boots and I have sprints faster.
[308:45.54]There's a goes faster and a sprints faster.
[308:47.66]So ten goat hooves is the same speed as three goat hooves and sprint faster.
[308:59.44]No, I think I still was going faster than you.
[309:02.77]What is this, a Sonic race?
[309:04.17]Like at my knuckles right now?
[309:05.27]We having like a tails race?
[309:13.57]I don't think it was worth it, you know?
[309:20.84]You can do it.
[309:22.04]You can kill them.
[309:23.42]And then we get to complete the cycle.
[309:30.10]Give it everything you have.
[309:33.47]Everything's on the line.
[309:37.57]Oh, you got tethered.
[309:38.27]You got tethered!
[309:39.98]I'm dead.
[309:41.02]No.
[309:42.08]No, you're back.
[309:42.56]You're back.
[309:42.90]He's back.
[309:43.20]He's back.
[309:44.54]Second win.
[309:57.50]Gotta go fast.
[310:03.10]Sekiro.
[310:03.96]Oh!
[310:09.88]You're at like 40%.
[310:10.54]35%, 30%.
[310:11.50]Oh my god.
[310:12.14]I gotta hide.
[310:13.90]There you go, there you go.
[310:24.87]Come on!
[310:27.09]Come on!
[310:32.75]So if you beat this, there's gonna be a portal that you're gonna go through instead of the teleporter.
[310:37.73]And that's going to give us both.
[310:38.81]100 gold.
[310:40.05]There's still one with full health.
[310:54.47]100.
[310:54.49]That's a lot.
[311:04.19]You're so close to getting rid of one of them.
[311:06.08]And that's, there it is.
[311:06.86]Okay, that's 33% less annoyance.
[311:11.28]Alright, I'm gonna go back over here.
[311:13.60]Chill for a second.
[311:20.86]They heal during the suck phase.
[311:22.54]Oh, okay, I see.
[311:24.50]Where is he?
[311:25.34]There he is.
[311:25.92]Right there.
[311:31.59]I'm so glad I just fed you those two items, and then I threw all mine away.
[311:36.50]Ow!
[311:37.06]Oh!
[311:41.38]You good?
[311:41.72]Just play it slow, play it simple.
[311:47.36]I need full health for this guy, because those rolling chase things, if I didn't go invisible, I think I would be dead.
[311:52.22]Yeah.
[311:53.38]Did he do the suck phase yet?
[311:56.48]Watch out for the rolling bombs.
[312:06.10]Why is one harder than everyone else?
[312:07.85]You know what I mean?
[312:09.89]Like, why is it there was five of them?
[312:11.29]Why was that easier than one?
[312:12.91]Because it's the illusions.
[312:14.39]It's just the one of them.
[312:16.11]That's the real one.
[312:16.95]You killed all the illusions.
[312:18.41]He's the illusion.
[312:25.52]My APM is probably so high right now.
[312:27.70]Come on, dude.
[312:28.44]Give us the Boy Scout badge for doing this.
[312:42.66]Wow, he like spawned right on top of you.
[312:52.68]It's all close.
[312:54.22]Oh god.
[312:58.64]Woohoo!
[313:03.32]55 minutes, you got it.
[313:04.16]55 minutes, oh my god.
[313:07.64]55 minutes, all we need.
[313:08.74]We're gonna see the cycle that will be completed.
[313:17.13]Let's get the chant going.
[313:20.07]Here we go, Etalyx.
[313:24.75]Here we go.
[313:25.98]Here we go, indeed.
[313:28.86]I think I got chunked for like 33% of my health.
[313:31.38]That was so close, though.
[313:32.64]You did so good.
[313:33.96]Jinxed it.
[313:35.54]Here we go.
[313:36.92]Like a baseball chant.
[313:39.06]I didn't ruin it.
[313:40.31]I didn't curse it.
[313:41.11]There's no such thing as curses.
[313:42.43]There's no such thing as ghosts.
[313:44.71]I got cursed.
[313:45.95]Oh, that's alright.
[313:48.72]Ugh.
[313:54.01]Damn.
[313:54.71]Let me see how close we are.
[313:59.67]He was the last guy.
[314:01.99]Yeah, but that was fucking insanely hard.
[314:04.78]Like, that was very difficult to do.
[314:07.02]Alright, let's see.
[314:11.40]We...
[314:16.53]Alright, we seriously need to do, like, it was back here before.
[314:22.80]We'll get it here.
[314:23.38]Maybe next time don't ruin your build with goat feet.
[314:31.44]Well, we had to see it, you know what I mean?
[314:33.42]I just wanted to see what it did.
[314:40.75]All that work.
[314:44.19]right this is the one how many are we away from success uh we are probably like three or four levels away so like one run probably one run one run from new character I think we can do it yeah well we I'm gonna I'm gonna okay here we go I'm gonna try really hard this time okay I'm gonna go multi this time I feel like I did good with them last time
[315:14.09]I think I'm gonna go Robot.
[315:17.60]I had a really fun build.
[315:19.62]That was probably the most fun Huntress build, yep.
[315:23.00]It was like fast, darting, teleporting.
[315:27.84]Let's give it a go.
[315:28.80]This is the one.
[315:29.24]Oh yeah, I have to invite you again.
[315:33.16]My bad.
[315:33.40]Yeah, there's gonna be sweat pouring off my body.
[315:35.57]I'm gonna go Robot.
[315:42.82]You going Robot or do you want me to?
[315:44.74]Double Robo might not be that bad.
[315:47.50]I could go Commando if you want.
[315:49.48]We could have one of each.
[315:50.98]Hmm.
[315:54.15]Double Robo.
[315:56.91]Double Robo.
[315:57.71]Double Robo.
[316:02.63]Wait, hey!
[316:06.05]I don't know.
[316:06.43]I could go either way on that one.
[316:08.20]Double Robo.
[316:09.32]Here we go.
[316:14.83]I'm gonna run off the cliff like a funny pig.
[316:18.61]Let's go.
[316:21.68]Oops.
[316:22.68]Forgot how to play.
[316:29.04]Alright, let's just do this here.
[316:29.86]We're here.
[316:31.11]Let's go.
[316:31.51]Challenge.
[316:38.73]Really?
[316:40.49]Okay, that was dumb.
[316:47.19]Speaking of dying on the first level... Man, the stun grenades on these groups are awesome.
[316:56.14]I'm missing every shot, so I'm going to switch to no-miss mode.
[316:59.74]No miss.
[317:00.38]Alright, we got... There's still somebody alive.
[317:01.92]I feel like the ram should do more damage.
[317:13.99]Okay.
[317:15.21]Uh...
[317:16.74]There's still one of those enemies left.
[317:18.42]He just threw a bomb at you.
[317:19.78]Is there?
[317:20.06]Yeah, he like ran down here.
[317:21.08]Maybe he's dead.
[317:22.98]I don't know.
[317:28.84]Okay, boxes.
[317:31.71]Ooh, a coin.
[317:34.15]Ooh, nice.
[317:34.47]We're up to six.
[317:36.43]Oh, you just killed him.
[317:37.03]Okay.
[317:38.81]We got an activation here for the scary monster at the end.
[317:42.95]The mountain?
[317:43.59]Mm-hmm.
[317:46.45]Let's double loot.
[317:52.03]Man, starting like a vanilla Isaac run after being a literal goddess.
[317:58.87]I feel so slow and pitiful.
[318:00.41]Alright, well, there it is.
[318:09.18]Well, that's better.
[318:09.84]How you doing?
[318:14.30]Good.
[318:16.91]You found the portal yet?
[318:18.29]Yep, right here.
[318:21.54]By me?
[318:21.90]Well, I am ready whenever.
[318:22.82]You want me to activate?
[318:23.94]Alright, here we go.
[318:30.28]You ready?
[318:31.97]Yep.
[318:32.95]I'm here.
[318:33.21]Three, two, one, activate.
[318:37.19]What is it?
[318:37.81]It is the... Two of these things.
[318:44.61]So is chance to stun amplified by scattershot mode?
[318:48.19]Oh, that's a good question.
[318:51.09]Like, since you're shooting more bullets, do you have more chance to stun, or is it more damage equals more chance?
[318:58.46]I don't even know.
[319:01.04]That's a good question.
[319:10.60]Why are you doing that, Trine Jerma?
[319:11.76]Well, because I wanted the fireworks to come out and do some damage.
[319:21.54]Behind us, careful.
[319:22.20]One of those robots.
[319:32.61]If Nailgun procs every time, that would be completely OP.
[319:36.59]Fair.
[319:38.07]Oh, I shot you.
[319:39.07]You look like a bad guy.
[319:43.01]Oh!
[319:44.00]Sorry, I'm just like screaming now.
[319:45.84]Okay, what the fuck?
[319:48.30]This is very bad, very bad.
[319:51.70]I'm gonna die.
[319:59.16]Uh-oh, it's happening again.
[320:02.48]This is a very bad position to be in.
[320:10.89]How do you heal in this game?
[320:11.95]I'm dead.
[320:13.43]Oh, okay.
[320:15.59]I'm joining you in a brief moment.
[320:22.08]Well, like... Stop doing that!
[320:23.64]You have to, like... Okay, so this, like, giant open area... You have to, like, hide under a fucking log.
[320:34.11]Well, that didn't work out as planned.
[320:36.65]Game over.
[320:38.71]Game over.
[320:39.67]Too slow.
[320:41.35]Too slow.
[320:45.89]It was the mountain shrine that did us in.
[320:49.13]Yeah, may have been.
[320:53.96]You want to be Huntress and I'll be multi?
[320:57.42]Or do you want me to be commando?
[320:59.18]I think double robo is not a good strat.
[321:01.18]I'm willing to be commando.
[321:02.29]I think we just got screwed because we did the mountain thing.
[321:05.33]We're both the slowest character and we had to fight two of the please stand behind a rock or you'd instantly die.
[321:21.10]He's the slowest character.
[321:28.07]first level death but we did do challenge mode so it was two level ones he moves the same p he's bigger though yeah see I'm sprinting and you're sprinting we're going the same to going to st Pete alright
[322:02.12]Hey, thanks for the coin.
[322:02.80]Hitting free money.
[322:04.42]There's a hurt yourself up there.
[322:06.30]Is there?
[322:07.22]For fun.
[322:12.98]Sure, why not?
[322:13.32]I don't remember what these do.
[322:18.10]Oh, that's a 75%.
[322:19.42]You touched it.
[322:19.90]I did, yes.
[322:24.43]Everything's fine.
[322:24.95]I'm alright.
[322:25.23]That is accurate.
[322:26.11]Oh, God.
[322:31.35]Damn it.
[322:35.83]I did Shortstop it.
[322:36.91]That is true.
[322:37.88]Alright, now I need to heal.
[322:43.76]There's damage while sprinting.
[322:50.40]I was saving up for that one.
[322:53.56]What else we got?
[322:54.66]Anything down here?
[322:55.12]I'll go for the active.
[322:59.08]What's in the active?
[323:00.30]Nice.
[323:01.30]Crit strike.
[323:03.52]There's another active right here.
[323:06.42]Yeah, there's two.
[323:06.88]Any more boxes?
[323:08.28]Which I don't need.
[323:10.84]I marked a crit for you.
[323:13.00]There's a heal right here, though.
[323:14.02]I want the heal bot.
[323:19.11]Alright, I guess we can go ahead and fight and then search afterward.
[323:24.79]Something like that.
[323:26.65]Is there any more down this hallway?
[323:30.31]This is 34, right?
[323:30.71]Yeah.
[323:35.07]Heal fruit.
[323:37.17]We should probably activate.
[323:42.15]How you doing over there?
[323:43.53]Coming back.
[323:44.49]Heading back.
[323:48.86]Start whenever.
[323:49.40]Alright.
[323:53.14]Let's go.
[324:01.98]My accuracy is terrible.
[324:04.63]What are we going to get here?
[324:06.27]Queen.
[324:06.84]The ant friend.
[324:07.92]Queen bug.

[324:39.41]Damn.
[324:41.13]Down to half.
[324:43.11]There's a lot of fire bugs.
[324:44.03]A lot of fire.
[324:45.15]There are.
[324:53.51]I'm gonna die.
[324:54.43]I'm gonna die.
[324:55.05]It's been fun.
[324:57.14]Damn, this is gonna be two in a row of us getting destroyed on the first level.
[325:05.68]Jesus.
[325:06.14]There's so many!
[325:07.02]What the fuck?
[325:07.58]Why are there this many?
[325:18.56]Out of my way.
[325:19.02]Alright, I'm back in the circle.
[325:24.99]It's not looking good.
[325:29.69]Oh, God.
[325:31.91]Oh, it hurt.

[326:31.00]Cool.
[326:32.12]I forgot to use my crit the whole time.
[326:33.78]I just like it extra challenging.
[326:38.33]Let's see.
[326:40.25]Are there any other boxes?
[326:41.13]I don't think there's any more boxes.
[326:58.04]He tried to run a shopping cart up the stairs.
[327:01.86]Yeah, but, like, come on.
[327:06.44]He's got legs.
[327:10.28]Up top.
[327:10.82]Is there one up there?
[327:12.16]I got two up this little tunnel.
[327:14.24]Alright, we gotta get out of this.
[327:20.30]Yeah.
[327:20.66]Eh, we're doing pretty good.
[327:22.18]We're just now getting to the second half of Easy.
[327:25.38]But yeah, I'm ready.
[327:35.97]Somebody said also well teleporter is charging the chests are red and they're easier to see That's true.
[327:42.91]That's a good point.
[327:43.78]They're red, but we can't open them yet, but we can see them We can see them.
[327:48.40]They're much easier to see on the map Oops
[328:04.47]Hurt yourself.
[328:05.57]Money machine.
[328:06.11]Yeah.
[328:06.39]Who wants to go first?
[328:10.63]You can go first.
[328:12.82]Mmm, sure.
[328:22.00]There's almost no reason not to use those.
[328:24.61]Not really, especially if you have any way to heal yourself.
[328:27.43]Okay, I only got chests.
[328:31.29]I'm gonna go for the gamble.
[328:31.99]Here we go.
[328:34.53]It worked out.
[328:35.67]No, it didn't, because I don't want a cube.
[328:37.05]You can get two bonus items.
[328:38.99]Do you have an active?
[328:40.77]Yes.
[328:41.53]Is it a cube?
[328:43.29]I have the crit.
[328:44.37]Would you like it to be a cube?
[328:46.25]No, I'm happy with the crit, I think.
[328:48.91]I just need to use it more.
[328:53.65]I just need to actually push Q. Oh wait, I can have two.
[328:57.08]Right, right, right, right.
[328:58.16]Yeah, you can have two.
[328:58.86]That's the point of this character's cool move.
[329:02.66]Exactly.
[329:05.54]Now you've got it.
[329:06.66]Wow.
[329:08.82]Utility.
[329:12.03]His name is Multi.
[329:15.61]Remember that.
[329:17.85]I won't.
[329:18.13]Alright, I need to open a box.
[329:23.23]What are these little slugs?
[329:24.58]Coin!
[329:33.26]You have, how many coins do you have?
[329:35.96]Six.
[329:36.82]Oh, I have six too.
[329:38.00]I'll take it.
[329:38.54]Wow.
[329:39.95]We're neck and neck.
[329:49.28]Do I dare do this again?
[329:50.92]No.
[329:51.38]What, gambling?
[329:52.32]No, no, no.
[329:53.82]93% health.
[330:02.12]I don't want that.
[330:02.68]What's this?
[330:05.30]I don't want that either.
[330:05.92]Ooh, I can't believe that roll worked.
[330:13.42]What about the heal?
[330:14.78]Uh, yeah, but it'll go on keel down, and I don't know if I... Ah, fine.
[330:18.72]Quite a lot of stuff this way.
[330:22.26]I'll claim as much as I can, but... No idea where the porter is.
[330:33.25]Well, I can gamble again.
[330:37.23]You know, get the fuck away from me, guys.
[330:39.43]Get away.
[330:42.37]Get away!
[330:44.93]Not even close to you.
[330:46.21]No, nothing.
[330:47.93]Please.
[330:49.89]Yeah, the first dink on healthy enemies is pretty good.
[330:59.24]Uh, enemies.
[330:59.82]Hello.
[331:00.32]Well... Uh...
[331:24.51]Um... I see no signs.
[331:28.89]I have so much money, too.
[331:29.59]...of our teleporting friend.
[331:40.50]It's stuck in a wall.
[331:41.48]Alright, there's some over here.
[331:46.34]I hate these little fire guys.
[331:47.62]What have we got?
[331:50.30]Worth no money.
[331:51.06]They're small and annoying.
[331:54.81]Missile thing.
[331:55.43]I think I have two or three of these now.
[332:02.26]Two.
[332:02.48]Huh.
[332:07.64]What is this?
[332:08.30]Is this a bleed build?
[332:09.97]Do you have bleed?
[332:12.69]There's a bleed printer here.
[332:14.59]I'm tempted by it.
[332:16.27]Slow enemies...
[332:25.51]Have to be sprinting while that happens, though.
[332:30.73]Bleed is bad.
[332:31.53]Why don't you tell the developers while they make their second game?
[332:35.96]Maybe they won't make the same mistake twice.
[332:37.48]A lot of enemies over here, too.
[332:42.38]I can take care of that.
[332:48.32]Like, are they copying all the stats one-to-one?
[332:51.14]Like, all the damage numbers, too?
[332:52.47]I don't know.
[332:56.58]That's a good question.
[332:59.56]But if I just get 10 bleed items, then I bleed every hit.
[333:03.94]I think that's percentage-based or something somebody was saying.
[333:11.31]I got all this money and nothing to spend it on, so are you ready to, uh... Uh, I have.
[333:16.94]I'm almost ready to do whatever you'd like to do, which is start the encounter.
[333:20.02]Because we're already, like, all the way up to medium.
[333:22.06]Yeah, we are.
[333:24.21]Like, almost to heart.
[333:25.59]This is true.
[333:28.09]Oh, this is... Okay, we're... It's this thing.
[333:33.60]Yeah, it's that thing.
[333:36.28]It is this thing.
[333:46.18]Goodbye.
[333:50.79]Just get, like... Just suck them all up.
[333:54.46]Coming around to help?
[333:55.84]I can't.
[333:56.04]I'm almost dead though.
[334:04.55]That you with the vortex?
[334:06.09]That was me with the vortex.
[334:16.05]Nope.
[334:18.03]Double jump is really good against these guys.
[334:19.93]You just jump right when they shoot and they can't hit you.
[334:23.92]Alright, one's dead.
[334:28.43]Two are dead.
[334:30.79]Ouch.
[334:34.81]God damn it.
[334:40.10]Fire guy.
[334:40.72]Fire, fire, fire.
[334:41.88]No, no, no.
[334:42.62]Fire bad.
[334:43.58]Fire very bad.
[334:46.16]My god.
[334:59.01]Alright, almost there.
[335:08.25]Jesus.
[335:11.08]Good.
[335:11.36]Alright.
[335:11.70]Bosses are dead.
[335:12.56]Boss is dead.
[335:13.18]Now just the babies.
[335:21.90]What the hell?
[335:23.10]Fuel cell.
[335:23.91]An additional charge.
[335:27.93]Not too bad.
[335:28.79]That's good.
[335:32.11]That's what the boss relic is next to you.
[335:34.01]Very cool.
[335:35.63]What costs $67 over here?
[335:40.14]Why does the teleporter cost $67?
[335:45.36]Because they decided to start taxing it.
[335:49.12]They realized free teleporters were bad for business.
[335:52.30]And this way, if you pay for your teleporter, they can make more teleporters in the future.
[336:01.74]Alright.
[336:02.08]I don't think there's any more... I have $800.
[336:05.01]Boxes.
[336:06.13]So do I. But we can take a quick look.
[336:08.29]We're already almost at hard.
[336:14.99]Nothing that way, I don't think.
[336:19.11]Yeah, this was pretty dry for boxes.
[336:26.34]Well.
[336:27.72]Alright.
[336:28.18]Whenever.
[336:29.70]Whenever.
[336:30.12]Let's move.
[336:35.62]It was an item.
[336:36.40]Okay.
[336:39.49]You got the will of the wisp?
[336:40.95]Yeah.
[336:42.19]There was a box underneath, hidden, under the teleporter.
[336:46.81]Interesting.
[336:47.39]Okay.
[336:47.79]It was like stacked on top of each other.
[336:49.70]Hey, we've done it.
[336:52.94]We've done it?
[336:54.16]We did it.
[336:55.84]We've unlocked the engineer.
[336:57.28]Oh, cool.
[336:57.68]Okay.
[337:05.61]Okay, money.
[337:08.15]Money, money, money.
[337:35.55]Hypnospace.
[337:42.15]What do you mean?
[337:43.55]Hypnospace.
[337:50.24]The engineer apparently is insane, I guess.
[338:02.72]Oh, do you see what I see?
[338:05.69]I see unlimited crit run.
[338:08.15]Do you?
[338:11.05]Yeah.
[338:11.47]Is it possible for unlimited crit run?
[338:13.47]Is it worth doing it?
[338:14.87]Should we take unlimited crit?
[338:18.05]Is it if you want to ditch literally everything?
[338:20.96]I mean, maybe.
[338:22.22]I don't know.
[338:22.72]I don't think I even have 10 items.
[338:24.80]Yeah, I was going to say, I don't feel like I have 10.
[338:28.94]I might give up a couple.
[338:30.60]Yeah, I'll do it like three or four times.
[338:36.79]What did I give up?
[338:42.11]I didn't even see.
[338:42.73]Let's see.
[338:45.16]What am I going to give up here?
[338:46.58]Ow.
[338:50.08]I don't think this machine works.
[338:54.62]Doesn't it?
[338:55.08]I think the machine's broken.
[338:56.98]The machine is broken.
[338:58.51]Do I not have any items?
[339:01.57]I don't think I have any items I can put in here.
[339:03.99]What?
[339:04.15]What?
[339:05.82]Apparently, do you have any... I don't have any white items somehow.
[339:11.80]Okay, this is gonna be bad, so group them up.
[339:14.20]Yeah, we're like really weak right now for some reason.
[339:20.80]I got two glasses.
[339:22.10]I'll go for like 30% seems good.
[339:24.74]Have fun with it.
[339:25.56]Hope you love it.
[339:26.24]Alright, I need to get a box.
[339:28.54]40% is reasonable.
[339:41.31]That's a lot of deeps.
[339:42.15]Here's the teleporter.
[339:48.05]Berserker's Pauldron.
[339:49.75]Enter a frenzy after killing three enemies in succession.
[339:54.54]Okay.
[339:56.26]Do we want to go ahead and pomp this, or we're already in very hard, so we may as well explore?
[339:59.56]Which one?
[340:00.44]I would probably say that option.
[340:10.60]It's not been a good loot box RNG run.
[340:17.12]Oh, they're all here.
[340:19.94]Yeah, we need to have more stuff.
[340:27.76]Did I not?
[340:28.30]Yeah, I did.
[340:28.52]Okay.
[340:28.62]I guess I'm going to go get more crit.
[340:38.10]I'm going to go this way.
[340:42.73]Wait, I have... Any other boxes?
[340:47.21]I think there's one in here.
[340:50.39]No.
[340:51.33]I didn't pick up the item.
[340:52.45]Look at all this stuff.
[340:57.04]Finally.
[340:58.24]Something over here.
[340:59.22]Okay, time for more crit.
[341:01.70]And then we can start.
[341:03.10]Triple jump now.
[341:08.63]Speaking of crit, you want to buy a crit?
[341:10.89]133 bucks?
[341:11.13]There's one over here you can just buy.
[341:20.20]You want to buy that?
[341:22.10]How much money do you have?
[341:25.00]I want to buy what?
[341:26.70]There's a crit.
[341:27.34]For $133, you can buy another crit.
[341:29.96]It's right over here.
[341:32.52]It's on my marker.
[341:34.08]Coming to you now.
[341:36.48]I will have 90%.
[341:39.32]You could use it?
[341:39.98]I had to lose my hooves, so I'm now very slow and dead.
[341:43.32]You want me to just buy this?
[341:44.76]Alright, well, I'm just gonna buy this.
[341:46.54]I have 576.
[341:48.58]I just got pushed into it.
[341:52.69]I was standing there and got pushed into it.
[341:58.75]What the fuck?
[342:01.81]Alright, let's go push the thing.
[342:14.93]Ooh.
[342:18.95]BM.
[342:19.43]I didn't even mean to do that.
[342:21.41]There was something else up there, too.
[342:23.71]I don't know what it was now.
[342:25.79]Uh, Magma Wyrm.
[342:27.69]Oh.
[342:34.38]Sure, it was.
[342:40.28]Oh, God.
[342:40.92]Easy.
[342:44.18]So stacking my crits on my crits probably doesn't do very much.
[342:51.78]Suck them all in.
[343:07.42]Still 80% crits is pretty solid.
[343:35.20]I didn't mean to press that button, but I did.
[343:40.62]The key is kind of just always rotate backwards, because he just kind of idly chases you.
[343:46.69]I have a lot of money.
[343:52.29]Holy shit, that's so many things up there.
[343:54.05]That's bad.
[343:58.89]Oh my god, there's so many of them.
[344:00.65]Holy shit.
[344:03.21]Oh god.
[344:04.29]It was all going so well until it wasn't.
[344:09.09]Alright, we should be fine.
[344:22.60]Oh no!
[344:24.01]Sunglasses rip.
[344:25.73]I didn't mean to push E. Where'd they go?
[344:31.46]I died.
[344:33.34]I kind of killed myself with fall damage.
[344:38.79]I may have fallen to my death.
[344:41.43]As is wont to happen.
[344:42.55]The good news is, you're almost got it.
[344:45.65]I do.
[344:46.99]And you need more items than I do anyway, so you can just have both.
[344:49.83]He's dead.
[344:52.77]He has been killed.
[344:54.01]Two guitars.
[344:54.65]Double ukulele.
[344:56.59]One guitar, two guitars.
[344:57.85]We don't have enough to do the portal, right?
[344:59.89]I don't think so, no.
[345:02.75]So you're free to go whenever you want.
[345:07.15]Uhhh... Well, we probably should just go.
[345:11.27]Portal, portal, portal, portal!
[345:12.83]Everyone's screaming, portal?
[345:14.07]Portal?
[345:15.35]Use portal?
[345:16.63]Get in the portal?
[345:17.55]Might as well check out the portal, okay?
[345:29.66]We're going into the Bazaar Between Time.
[345:38.20]I just fucking fell off.
[345:42.27]Might be able to convert some items for something good.
[345:44.99]Should we try this item conversion?
[345:48.48]I don't even know how this works.
[345:49.88]Yeah, I don't understand how it works either.
[345:51.82]That's the Buckler.
[345:53.88]And I don't know what that item is.
[345:55.28]Ten Lunar.
[345:56.72]Alien Head.
[345:57.62]Alright, chat wrote Alien Head in all caps, so I'm just gonna push E. Wait.
[346:03.28]What'd you get?
[346:04.56]How do you do it?
[346:07.57]I think you're doing it.
[346:09.37]Are you doing it?
[346:09.85]I think you just did it twice.
[346:11.71]I don't think I'm doing it.
[346:15.93]You have to have five green items.
[346:18.03]I only have two.
[346:21.01]Three.
[346:21.53]I have three green items.
[346:24.96]I see.
[346:26.16]Is it white items for the green one then?
[346:27.94]I guess.
[346:28.80]Oh, I see.
[346:29.58]It's sort of green text.
[346:32.18]So Jerma should do it?
[346:33.30]Jerma do it.
[346:34.02]Don't do it.
[346:36.01]Jerma, get up there.
[346:36.81]Do it.
[346:37.15]Do it.
[346:37.39]Don't do it.
[346:37.79]Don't do it.
[346:38.23]Don't do it.
[346:38.65]Do it.
[346:38.99]You should do it.
[346:40.38]It's not worth it.
[346:41.06]It is worth it.
[346:42.93]Duality.
[346:44.77]Alright, you ready?
[346:49.75]You gonna jump in the pool?
[346:51.63]That's scary.
[346:54.35]Well, good thing we went here.
[346:56.75]But I guess it's better to look... Except it's not, because now we're gonna be in impossible difficulty.
[347:02.29]Don't do it.
[347:03.25]It's OP, but do not do it.
[347:06.73]Whatever.
[347:07.85]Just kill the lizards.
[347:10.97]It reduces cooldowns, but you don't rely on cooldowns.
[347:13.48]Okay.
[347:16.56]Look at this bat spawn.
[347:17.90]Bat spawn!
[347:19.90]Unbelievable.
[347:25.28]That doesn't interrupt him?
[347:25.98]I feel like it should.
[347:29.42]Why did you spawn right here?
[347:36.44]This is insane mode!
[347:38.95]So you have to be crazy and unexpected.
[347:41.83]I love these green mushrooms growing from my shoulders.
[347:52.12]So bouncy.
[347:54.00]So there's a... I don't know if you want to do this.
[347:56.02]There's a party... I don't know if... What?
[347:58.38]A party?
[347:59.00]Party shrine.
[347:59.58]I want to go to a party.
[348:00.88]Combat shrine.
[348:02.38]Probably... Should we do it?
[348:05.06]Yeah.
[348:05.24]Combat shrine?
[348:05.74]Might as well.
[348:11.20]What is it?
[348:13.56]Bad guy.
[348:13.98]5 o'clock.
[348:14.28]Looks like Bellfriends.
[348:15.22]Come on.
[348:32.79]I didn't hit that.
[348:34.61]I feel so weak even with 70% crit.
[348:39.52]I'm dead.
[348:39.94]That's why.
[348:41.29]Yeah, I'm dead.
[348:43.41]I feel very weak.
[348:44.65]Fire damage killed me.
[348:45.54]There's no way I can bring you back?
[348:51.50]No.
[348:57.37]Well, I have $2,400.
[348:58.21]Should I just go open the chest?
[349:17.51]I have almost three grand.
[349:28.24]Damn it, I missed you.
[349:34.08]Three thousand?
[349:34.94]It's four thousand, right?
[349:37.86]You have two double jumps, I know.
[349:39.20]I know, I'm just not using them.
[349:49.86]So where's this magic legendary chest?
[349:54.06]Apparently it's in the middle of the map.
[349:55.50]It's literally right next to me.
[349:57.12]Oh, you're standing on it.
[349:58.74]3,700 bucks?
[349:59.41]I mean, you might be able to buy it and see what's in it in a moment.
[350:04.09]Or I'll die.
[350:04.55]It's time for you to carry me.
[350:05.73]I got it.
[350:16.92]Okay, what's in it?
[350:17.82]What's in it?
[350:18.80]What's in it?
[350:20.73]What is it?
[350:22.41]It's Borderlands 3!
[350:23.93]It's the ceremonial dagger.
[350:25.27]Oh.
[350:27.45]Killing an enemy releases homing daggers.
[350:30.83]I've got this at a regular chest like three times.
[350:33.58]Have you?
[350:34.36]Yeah.
[350:34.96]I've never gotten that item.
[350:37.44]That's worth four grand?
[350:42.86]Well... Alright.
[350:45.36]That's worth four grand.
[350:47.08]That was thirty-seven hundred bucks.
[350:50.75]I have two of them now.
[350:51.54]You have two daggers right now.
[350:52.68]That's what I'm saying.
[350:53.74]I picked it up out of, like, a random box.
[350:56.54]Those daggers are gonna murder people.
[350:58.68]Alright, well, let's find the thing.
[350:59.74]Let me see if I can just kill the boss.
[351:01.62]This is gonna be nightmare.
[351:03.85]It's right here.
[351:11.23]These belt things are gonna be a pain in the ass.
[351:12.73]I already know it.
[351:23.76]Here we go.
[351:25.44]What do we got?
[351:27.99]Stone Titan.
[351:29.99]Right next to me.
[351:31.35]And it's, it's two.
[351:43.63]Holy shit.
[351:54.74]Jesus.
[351:55.20]I don't know what this is, but I'm gonna grab it.
[352:22.05]Oh, it's a healbot.
[352:28.67]Trying to jump up here.
[352:45.74]He keeps spawning things underneath me.
[352:51.89]Alright, here we go.
[352:52.43]Let's see if I can get some daggers here.
[352:59.58]And.
[353:13.92]No, no fucking way.
[353:23.23]I got melted.
[353:25.11]Good try.
[353:27.10]Well, let's try the engineer.
[353:28.66]The new character?
[353:29.52]Yeah.
[353:29.76]Let's see what it is.
[353:31.34]The engineer.
[353:38.95]Bouncing nades.
[353:40.59]Mines.
[353:41.11]Bubble shield.
[353:42.21]Auto turrets.
[353:43.53]Oh, baby.
[353:45.39]So it's going to be ten characters, I guess.
[353:48.99]Six in the game now.
[353:51.99]Looks like it.
[353:59.87]Eight grenades.
[354:03.98]Three thousands of mines.
[354:11.20]So you can put down a bubble sheet?
[354:12.50]That's weird.
[354:18.25]He's very boring.
[354:20.03]But he's OP.
[354:20.51]Hmm.
[354:23.67]Very boring, huh?
[354:24.75]I don't know if I've ever said that about a person who places turrets...
[354:32.50]Everybody likes placing turrets, right?
[354:34.28]Well, I want to see it.
[354:38.50]Well, we got to try it out.
[354:41.00]Mines.
[354:41.38]Eight bounce nades.
[354:42.24]Grenades.
[354:43.14]Super mine.
[354:45.83]There's so much to look at.
[354:46.81]Let's see.
[354:47.69]Oh, this is cool.
[354:55.81]What, eight?
[354:56.65]Okay.
[354:57.70]Okay, so right click mine.
[355:02.17]Now, can I activate these?
[355:04.05]No.
[355:04.97]They have to recharge very slowly as well.
[355:08.01]So then what is this one?
[355:09.73]What is that?
[355:10.56]That's a shield.
[355:12.56]Oh, nice bubble shield.
[355:13.70]Now we're playing EDF.
[355:15.22]Apparently.
[355:16.78]And then what's the cooldown on the other one?
[355:19.42]On turret.
[355:20.90]So we can shoot up, but they can't shoot in.
[355:22.47]The best kind of shield.
[355:29.58]Hold left click down to shoot more.
[355:31.08]This seems like this game just got 45% easier.
[355:36.74]Did it?
[355:37.70]I mean, you put two turrets down?
[355:40.09]That seems fucking amazing.
[355:44.73]We had five community subs.
[355:47.49]From Rin, the cutest.
[355:48.55]Thank you, Rin.
[355:49.09]Wow, I'm liking you one-shot enemies with left click.
[355:52.19]I guess you can do that as the... Thank you so much for the subs.
[355:55.01]Multi as well.
[355:55.94]Five.
[355:57.24]Bring them in.
[356:00.38]Thank you.
[356:04.80]And you can just kind of spam this around, huh?
[356:07.22]Seems like it.
[356:08.88]Okay.
[356:09.38]Have you seen any boxes yet?
[356:12.54]That's a drawback, Engineer.
[356:14.02]45% less boxes.
[356:16.31]No loot.
[356:18.83]Only lucky shrines.
[356:21.33]Can you throw them?
[356:22.67]Okay, you can.
[356:23.43]You can kind of toss them a little bit.
[356:31.54]nice alright well don't forget to put down your teleporter and dispenser will do and also sell my unusual for real money is there one box on the whole level uh there have been zero boxes I'm in favor of just restarting let's just redo it like where the hell
[357:04.73]let's do it again because that was dumb oh we also were playing around with the move set yeah but like I didn't open I didn't see one box you can attach mines to Jerma hey check your Steam man turrets also get the effects of your items
[357:31.69]That sounds insane.
[357:33.07]Hold on, stand still?
[357:34.17]How much damage does the shield mitigate?
[357:38.87]Oh, you... Alright, go.
[357:41.07]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[357:44.41]I'm going for it.
[357:46.16]Wait, let me do that to you.
[357:46.96]Come here.
[357:50.34]Oh yeah, hitting airborne enemies is miserable.
[357:53.74]Alright, we were supposed to... Restart!
[357:55.98]Dude, no, don't.
[357:59.98]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[358:01.55]Oh, it bounces my own bubbles.
[358:02.71]What about from in?
[358:04.51]Not from inside.
[358:05.25]Alright, give me some stuff.
[358:16.29]Active.
[358:16.81]What is it?
[358:20.14]Slug.
[358:21.86]Flight.
[358:22.20]I feel like that would be okay.
[358:30.75]I miss my movement ability.
[358:35.66]I just do hover guy.
[358:36.70]At least I never get my feet wet.
[358:43.26]Flying mines.
[358:44.30]Why would you put it just carpet?
[358:45.76]Like drop.
[358:46.36]Alright, what the fuck is hitting me?
[358:49.14]Stupid elite.
[358:50.03]Oh, fuck off.
[358:53.05]Plus things are so good.
[358:58.09]Come on, run into my mines.
[359:00.11]Come on.
[359:02.26]You stick a mine to yourself.
[359:03.74]Oh, no, that's what's going on.
[359:04.80]Your mines are blowing up.
[359:07.03]It's because you're throwing up more.
[359:08.37]Okay, that was just freaking me out.
[359:09.29]I was like, why?
[359:09.67]What's going on with me?
[359:10.29]What's happening to my character?
[359:11.75]Yeah, I guess you can only have, like, ten at a time.
[359:13.89]Uh, period.
[359:17.18]I found the portal.
[359:26.18]So they activate pretty quickly.
[359:27.20]Ooh.
[359:29.64]So, question.
[359:30.22]Do things like bleed and such stack with your turret?
[359:35.17]Area.
[359:36.17]Items stack with your turrets, apparently.
[359:39.15]Mushroom is super good.
[359:41.53]I don't know which one of these to pick.
[359:44.29]Yes, they do.
[359:48.84]So, do I not have a move I can stop from her getting hurt from falling?
[359:54.58]Good question.
[359:55.34]I don't think you do.
[360:02.40]The turrets can proc bleed, sticky bomb, everything.
[360:05.87]Fungus is overpowered on turrets because they just heal infinitely.
[360:08.89]That's kind of cool.
[360:10.31]So is fungus... What is the slug?
[360:13.55]Is that fungus?
[360:15.03]Engineer does not have any mobility movements.
[360:17.85]Okay.
[360:18.35]Good to know.
[360:25.54]Slug is heal out of combat.
[360:27.14]Okay.
[360:28.76]Okay.
[360:28.98]Let me look for chests.
[360:33.25]Yeah, I can fly with this.
[360:34.27]Like, I just forget I have it.
[360:39.22]How much was this one?
[360:39.84]This class seems fun.
[360:43.94]Everybody who's saying it's boring... Well, that's probably used to... Probably just a hater.
[360:51.56]I can see that, though, because you really only have one move that you can really even do.
[360:54.40]I feel like I only have one move with... Multi...
[361:02.12]It's kind of hard to hit this, too.
[361:04.86]It's a boss, probably.
[361:05.74]Uh, you want to get it started?
[361:11.50]What are you fighting over here?
[361:24.38]I just like shooting the, like, burst of, uh... of little bombs.
[361:30.34]Alright, let's activate this thing.
[361:34.09]Engineer is the boss killer.
[361:37.87]Ooh.
[361:39.29]Gold per bullet.
[361:41.45]The crowd funder.
[361:51.00]Gotta get more money.
[361:52.12]I'll try this.
[361:56.60]There's a gun on my gun.
[361:58.36]Hopefully that didn't work.
[362:03.78]sword do it again and shields do you have an active I do I have the money gun alright uh we gotta get this rolling alright we gotta go we gotta go we do have to go
[362:33.45]I think I found it already.
[362:34.53]Where the hell was it?
[362:35.25]Yeah, it's like right over here, I think.
[362:36.99]At least I thought I did.
[362:39.95]To the right.
[362:42.35]I'm just going to stop at the luck shrine for some quick gambling.
[362:56.76]Anything else?
[362:58.91]No.
[362:59.21]Alright.
[363:00.13]I'm ready.
[363:01.09]Let's go.
[363:02.95]Preemptively put down turret.
[363:05.91]How long do the turrets last for, though?
[363:07.37]I don't know.
[363:08.41]Wait, how many can you put down?
[363:09.49]Two?
[363:09.73]Two.
[363:11.53]Oh.
[363:14.81]You missed your turrets, but don't worry, I got them.
[363:21.47]You can stick it to people, too.
[363:22.75]Oh, that's cool.
[363:25.85]Alright, what does a money gun do?
[363:29.36]Oh, ow, ow.
[363:31.95]Shooting all my bullets.
[363:33.93]All my money.
[363:34.45]Okay, where's the other guy?
[363:44.84]Hey, repair your turret.
[363:47.76]Where's the other wasps?
[363:51.51]Isn't there... Where's the other boss?
[363:53.29]Greater wasp?
[363:54.63]Where is it?
[363:56.19]He's flying somewhere, I guess.
[364:05.36]Okay.
[364:07.47]Oh.
[364:08.47]I just got air shot twice!
[364:09.87]You're shielding the bad guys!
[364:11.45]Why do the bad guys have a shield?
[364:13.47]I'm gonna die!
[364:15.15]Because... Oh my god.
[364:21.02]Give me a break.
[364:25.48]Where is this boss?
[364:28.36]What?
[364:30.07]I don't know, but we still have to do the teleporter anyway, so we may as well sit here.
[364:32.91]No, he's not.
[364:33.59]What?
[364:39.20]He's back here.
[364:40.18]He's, like, blending in with the grass.
[364:53.43]Okay.
[364:53.91]They're dead.
[364:55.05]Okay.
[364:55.91]Okay.
[364:57.81]We can proceed.
[364:59.67]Alright.
[365:00.09]Turn invisible on taking heavy damage is going to be there for you.
[365:07.84]I'm gonna die!
[365:11.42]Where are you?
[365:12.80]I just kind of flew up here to go look for boxes.
[365:17.14]I use my hover jets.
[365:20.11]Which I feel like is not a very good invention considering how big they are.
[365:23.63]And they can only get me one foot off the ground.
[365:25.35]Did I spend all my money...
[365:29.20]With my Q-Gun.
[365:29.98]I don't think I have any boxes over here.
[365:33.38]I think this isn't active.
[365:34.58]How do you turn it off?
[365:37.58]Well, hey, if you want a box, I'm standing right next to one.
[365:40.10]I think I found two boxes over here.
[365:42.50]This money gun is a trap.
[365:43.75]Uh, I don't know what that is, but it's mine.
[365:47.43]The crystal... Yeah, I don't have any money, so it's all yours.
[365:50.01]Um... Okay, I just picked up something called the Crowd Funder.
[365:53.55]Yeah, that's what made me go broke.
[365:56.41]Oh.
[365:56.57]I have that.
[365:57.53]That's the thing that sucks.
[366:00.16]Well, I don't know if it sucks, but it steals all your money when you... So don't get it.
[366:07.91]How do you turn it off once it starts using your money?
[366:13.65]Yeah, I toggled it off after the first time I used it, and apparently that didn't happen.
[366:20.27]Hey, Jerma, I was hoping I could be the one guy.
[366:22.86]You're cute and bad at games.
[366:23.96]I appreciate 50% of that comment.
[366:31.63]Alright, where's this box you're talking about?
[366:35.11]It's like way over there.
[366:39.60]I'm looking.
[366:40.58]Scanning.
[366:41.26]There it is.
[366:43.84]Hopefully I don't kill it.
[366:44.54]Don't kill me.
[366:44.98]Don't kill me.
[366:45.36]Don't kill me.
[366:45.80]How long does this wing last for?
[366:51.09]Not that.
[366:51.53]Oh, god damn it.
[366:56.11]Alright.
[366:57.13]You just press the button and get us out of here.
[367:00.19]Is it still on?
[367:01.27]It definitely can't toggle it off by pushing Q, chat.
[367:03.86]It's still spending money literally as fast as I can get it.
[367:06.76]You can't turn it off.
[367:08.50]The difficulty is just rising.
[367:14.24]You can't turn off the money gun.
[367:16.45]No.
[367:18.15]I think the money gun just always siphons money.
[367:21.75]I think this run is over.
[367:22.99]Somebody said, you can turn it off.
[367:24.45]I don't know what he's doing.
[367:26.45]Look, it's really easy.
[367:27.77]You just push Q, Chant.
[367:33.65]See?
[367:36.11]Money gun.
[367:38.23]Sometimes it doesn't want to go off, though.
[367:41.49]See?
[367:41.81]Like, it glows when I shoot.
[367:43.81]Grab your item before I delete it.
[367:48.12]Like, yep.
[367:57.95]You left my mines behind.
[368:09.19]Why did I let you have that?
[368:10.37]I don't know why you didn't press it.
[368:11.77]That's why I saw it.
[368:12.69]I was like, he's not going to press it, is he?
[368:19.81]Okay.
[368:20.32]Looking for a teleporter.
[368:35.73]The mines seem pretty effective.
[368:38.59]Hello.
[368:41.41]Give me money.
[368:41.95]57.
[368:48.66]Come on.
[368:49.28]Oh, it's right here.
[368:50.38]Found it.
[368:52.88]You want to try to kill it now while there's no enemies here?
[368:54.40]What are you talking about?
[368:56.06]I found the teleporter.
[368:56.96]It's right here.
[368:57.82]Oh.
[368:57.98]Maybe.
[368:59.95]We don't have any spawns or anything.
[369:01.01]We just try to kill it right now.
[369:05.31]Just kind of smoke it and then be able to run around.
[369:08.15]Let me grab one item on the way to you.
[369:17.97]Okay.
[369:19.11]I'm ready.
[369:21.43]Alright.
[369:22.78]Just don't push Q. Do not push Q. Can you just drop it?
[369:26.48]I don't think I can.
[369:33.30]Just to call you to kill it.
[369:43.66]We have two shields.
[369:44.46]It's better than one.
[369:51.77]Anybody that gets in here is going to get mine.
[370:03.59]Well, we are shredding bosses.
[370:06.69]We kind of had to do that, though.
[370:08.69]We've run out of time.
[370:12.76]Alright, what do we got?
[370:13.40]Boxes?
[370:13.78]A few boxes, maybe?
[370:16.90]Wait, are you supposed to be able to charge your gun while sprinting?
[370:19.34]That seems like maybe something you're not supposed to be able to do.
[370:24.36]Not at all.
[370:25.58]FYI, you can left-click, then sprint.
[370:31.68]But the game doesn't want you to know that.
[370:33.42]Okay, I've got a kiosk over here.
[370:40.46]Just looking around.
[370:41.02]Okay, I see an item that way, this way.
[370:42.66]We kind of just stand here, huh?
[370:49.56]We do have to literally just stand here.
[370:53.62]Did I pick up that item?
[370:54.48]What is this?
[370:54.80]Did you get yours already?
[370:56.08]Yeah, I got mine.
[370:57.84]Oh, it's just the invisible thing again.
[370:59.08]Alright, we good?
[371:07.85]Alright, there's something over here.
[371:18.42]Why am I doing that?
[371:19.32]I don't know.
[371:20.64]Attack speed.
[371:27.99]That's kind of good.
[371:32.25]One down there.
[371:40.39]Two down here.
[371:43.61]Beautiful.
[371:49.02]Slow enemies.
[371:49.66]Another one.
[371:51.04]They really stuffed them back here, huh?
[371:55.54]Alright.
[371:59.26]How you doing?
[372:01.79]I found a couple chests.
[372:03.45]Nothing that's going to make the run.
[372:04.79]I see one I can't even get to.
[372:08.69]Up there.
[372:09.87]I'll get that one.
[372:13.03]How?
[372:13.82]Pray for me.
[372:15.68]What are you gonna do?
[372:17.04]This.
[372:17.92]Three.
[372:18.98]Oh, you can fly.
[372:19.76]Two.
[372:20.22]One.
[372:20.52]Liftoff.
[372:25.12]Uh, what the hell is this?
[372:26.77]Don't go outside the map.
[372:27.41]No, it's a lunar.
[372:28.11]It needs a coin.
[372:28.91]It needs a lunar coin.
[372:29.75]Alright, let's get out of here.
[372:32.21]Wow, that is dumb.
[372:33.31]Quick, quick, dude.
[372:33.91]Hurry up.
[372:34.41]You gotta tap as fast as you can.
[372:39.56]Jump down this hole.
[372:40.80]Weirdly enough, I didn't take any damage.
[372:43.30]Why?
[372:43.46]Why?
[372:48.99]This is the slowest character in the game so far.
[372:51.91]Are you ready for me to press this?
[372:53.47]Yeah.
[372:54.51]Sadly.
[372:54.69]Why did it not take any damage?
[372:58.40]May as well have used my money gun.
[373:01.96]There's a chest!
[373:10.44]Alright.
[373:11.22]Find it.
[373:11.54]Up there.
[373:15.44]I feel like mines are underpowered.
[373:22.95]find it come on lag what's going on with that lag some of these annoying things is hanging out here well turrets are pretty awesome they really are
[373:53.77]What is this view?
[373:57.69]Ooh.
[373:59.09]A kiosk.
[374:04.47]What do we got?
[374:05.09]What do we got?
[374:06.74]What do we got?
[374:07.06]This one.
[374:16.90]Found the thing we're looking for.
[374:18.93]Found the teleporter.
[374:21.77]You know, mines are good for people staying on boss fights.
[374:23.69]Because you can just slap them on there and it's pretty much impossible to miss.
[374:29.18]True.
[374:29.88]There's extra damage.
[374:37.96]Ooh, 66.
[374:38.56]This character is kind of fucking insane.
[374:44.53]yeah it seems that way uh it's right here oh nice another equipment charge for my money gun that I do not want sticky bombs
[375:11.59]Alright.
[375:12.71]How you doing?
[375:14.69]Uh, just hanging out.
[375:17.17]Looking at the meter about to switch to very hard in a moment.
[375:19.93]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[375:21.81]Attack speed again.
[375:28.43]Cool.
[375:34.15]I feel like the teleporter is always in that same spot on this level.
[375:37.37]It's always like kind of back here, isn't it?
[375:44.78]You ready?
[375:45.11]Yeah, I think I'm ready.
[375:48.05]Come to me.
[375:50.45]One second.
[375:54.19]It's 260.
[375:56.92]I'm pretty much here.
[375:57.56]Alright, what do your cooldowns look like?
[376:01.62]Everything is refreshed and ready to go.
[376:03.56]Alright, here we go.
[376:12.96]It is the Imp Overlord.
[376:16.08]Where are you?
[376:17.78]There you are.
[376:24.86]Turrets are getting beasted on now.
[376:26.46]Yes, they are.
[376:27.18]Woo!
[376:30.10]Fly away.
[376:30.52]Maybe not.
[376:34.90]Let's just stay in here.
[376:37.19]There's a fucking cow in here with me.
[376:38.75]Alright, I gotta get the fuck out of there.
[376:44.38]Well, we're doing a lot of... She's not happy.
[376:48.83]Oh, man.
[376:49.35]I'm dead.
[376:49.65]She's not happy with my turret spot.
[376:51.71]God damn it.
[376:53.23]Just couldn't really get out of there.
[376:54.73]Yeah, he teleported on top of me.
[377:10.43]Oh, dear.
[377:10.97]Yeah, that's what he did to me.
[377:25.44]Money gun.
[377:27.18]Money, money, money, money.
[377:35.15]Nothing bad can happen in here, right?
[377:36.75]Oh boy, you're in trouble.
[377:41.95]Turtle inside the crate.
[377:45.65]The classic strategy.
[377:47.43]Well, I spent all my money, but you know what?
[377:49.67]I forgot that it happens when I left click.
[377:51.31]Money gun is the worst on this because you have to charge up.
[378:17.44]Hide.
[378:18.60]This is surprisingly functional.
[378:37.27]And I got some money back.
[378:40.93]Super jump.
[378:45.90]Okay.
[378:46.98]Alright.
[378:48.06]You've had your fun.
[378:50.98]I just need this one chest.
[378:54.94]Risk of turtling.
[378:58.88]Sometimes, yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[379:02.58]I am playing, we are playing the Engineer.
[379:04.64]Yeah.
[379:07.50]It's not like we're playing, um, the Gunslinger.
[379:11.72]Sorry.
[379:12.06]Alright.
[379:14.02]Let's get out of here.
[379:24.03]Slowly.
[379:24.39]Is this level three?
[379:27.21]I think so.
[379:29.58]So advancing before insane, I think, is pretty decent.
[379:35.18]Fairly...
[379:37.25]lukewarm fairly below lukewarm fairly like lukewarm into average somebody said read this comment you got it no no I didn't and there's a super chest here no I did there's a there's a super chest 3 300 bucks keep in mind uh it wasn't worth it last time it didn't seem like it
[380:06.14]Would it be worth it this time?
[380:12.19]Hey, new active.
[380:13.85]I'm just going to stand here until I get 200 bucks to switch it over.
[380:22.94]Which may never happen.
[380:24.70]What do I need?
[380:25.14]How much?
[380:30.08]That first chest has fungus, and apparently we can just have infinite fungus and have our turrets never die.
[380:38.28]That is what I have heard.
[380:39.12]That is currently what is being told.
[380:41.08]Chat just simply can't stop talking about it.
[380:43.74]They're just so excited.
[380:45.10]So fungus, you want me to 3D print all my stuff.
[380:48.46]How much fungus should I get?
[380:55.45]I'll take the fungus.
[380:57.65]I'll take the fungus.
[381:02.54]I'll take a fungus.
[381:05.58]Alright, who the fuck is doing this to me?
[381:07.04]Leave me alone.
[381:11.58]Exclamation fungus!
[381:19.21]Get like five to ten.
[381:19.99]You done?
[381:20.17]Uh, I'm getting like, I'm getting like, how much do I have?
[381:23.53]Five?
[381:23.81]I'll get, I'll get seven.
[381:26.51]I'm waiting for my turn at the fungus, uh, machine.
[381:28.89]Alright, I'm done.
[381:34.07]Are you sure?
[381:34.73]Have fun.
[381:35.65]Stay away from my fungus.
[381:36.59]No, no, what do you mean no?
[381:38.63]I thought you guys didn't, everyone just say get like between 5 to 10.
[381:42.41]Between like 5, too much.
[381:45.34]Back up.
[381:46.64]Did I pick it up?
[381:47.22]Did I take yours?
[381:48.02]No, it's my fungus.
[381:49.06]Alright, have fun with your fungus.
[381:49.92]7 is not too much, okay?
[381:54.86]We got a fruit here.
[381:57.68]We gotta do the meme build.
[382:01.28]I mean, we just have to stand in one spot and have our turrets do everything.
[382:07.68]It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[382:08.96]Everyone's like, this is the most boring clash.
[382:11.54]It's because when I find the fungus machine, I train everything for ultimate fungus build.
[382:18.26]That's a huge, huge area.
[382:21.71]And if we have four of these, and we can stand still... Alright, I have nine fungus.
[382:27.47]You have nine, I got seven.
[382:30.24]So if we stack our turrets one on top of the other.
[382:32.08]Okay, but what the fuck is killing me right now?
[382:35.28]Did you pick this up?
[382:36.06]What is this?
[382:39.40]What is going on with the fire damage in this game?
[382:42.40]I don't know.
[382:42.82]It's kind of crazy.
[382:43.52]Just put down a turret.
[382:44.30]Alright, let's go find the thing and then just stand on top of our turrets.
[382:48.43]Let's create an aura of healing turrets.
[382:55.31]Alright, let's find it.
[383:05.84]over here where it's over there oh what happens if you go all the way up here oh how do you get down that's a good question what's in here okay we've got if I jump from this height am I gonna be dead be careful
[383:38.93]This seems dangerous.
[383:41.31]I don't know what's happening, but this seems really, really, really powerful.
[383:45.60]I think we found the build that we're both going to have to beat the game with.
[383:51.56]Alright, where's that mask?
[383:54.32]Wow, the AOE is gigantic.
[383:57.68]After killing three... Where's the teleporter?
[384:02.70]Oh, let's activate it.
[384:07.72]Alright, let's... ready?
[384:10.92]Put it on your shit.
[384:13.66]Make sure you put it in the same spot so we can all get, like, we can... it can stack on us.
[384:17.17]It's a Magma Wyrm.
[384:19.49]Dude, this is... I... Am I playing Overwatch?
[384:24.29]That's what I feel like I'm... I feel like there's eight Ultimates going on.
[384:26.47]You are now.
[384:29.49]So who said we'd be unkillable?
[384:30.47]What the fuck is happening?
[384:31.11]Because one of my turrets is already dead.
[384:33.79]You liars.
[384:39.36]You have to stand still too, right?
[384:41.68]Do I stand still?
[384:43.00]I think I'm invincible.
[384:43.60]Do we all stand still?
[384:44.52]I think we all stand still.
[384:46.02]Oh my god.
[384:46.80]Okay.
[384:47.20]No, wait, wait.
[384:47.72]That's probably not a good idea.
[384:48.66]Is it a good idea?
[384:50.28]We should stand still.
[384:53.84]Stand still right next to each other.
[384:57.00]I don't know if I like this.
[384:58.98]It feels a little terrifying, yeah.
[385:04.26]I'm taking a lot of damage.
[385:05.64]Yeah.
[385:08.30]We didn't plan this good enough.
[385:10.27]We should have stuck on top of each other.
[385:12.57]Okay, I'm here.
[385:18.37]Here's a shield.
[385:20.21]I'm going to stand still now.
[385:21.43]Here's my turret.
[385:22.41]Okay, good.
[385:28.52]Yeah, Magma Wyrm probably is not...
[385:32.08]What was intended.
[385:33.84]It's Overwatch with mods.
[385:36.48]Remember when they used to do the arcade mode?
[385:38.82]Yeah.
[385:39.98]Well, that sucks.
[385:40.98]Uh-oh.
[385:41.34]I'm getting chunked.
[385:41.96]You've got to be kidding me.
[385:43.28]What just fucking happened right there?
[385:44.71]I'm flying.
[385:45.25]Are you serious right now?
[385:50.27]What was... I got another turret in.
[385:53.15]We have four turrets now.
[385:57.48]I hope that they can do good deeps.
[385:59.12]Why is fire damage, like, times 500 times damage?
[386:02.98]You're dead.
[386:04.14]No, I'm almost dead.
[386:05.10]I'm coming back.
[386:06.79]Into the heals.
[386:07.67]The delicious heals.
[386:08.85]I'm healed.
[386:15.21]I gotta hold still.
[386:18.87]It's fucked.
[386:19.49]If any one of us panics and, like, runs away...
[386:22.92]It's like we're breaking the herd immunity.
[386:25.36]Oh, the devs know it's broken.
[386:26.52]Oh, fire is actually broken.
[386:28.02]Like, it's a broken mechanic.
[386:29.68]Oh, like it's actually glitched.
[386:30.86]Like, actually, like, they're patching it because it's broken.
[386:34.22]Okay, well, that makes sense.
[386:35.18]I was going to say, what the fuck?
[386:37.78]Like, see?
[386:38.04]Look at that.
[386:40.71]Are you dead?
[386:41.29]Yeah, you just healed through, like, dying.
[386:43.59]How are you dead?
[386:44.81]Because he launched me across the whole game and I died to fire damage.
[386:51.86]I didn't realize I was alone in this.
[386:53.78]He knocked me in the air and put a dot on me and it was doing like 200 damage a tick.
[386:57.84]And then I died from the fall.
[387:00.80]All the turrets are getting healed too.
[387:02.26]Uh-oh.
[387:05.54]That was bad.
[387:06.34]That was a nasty one.
[387:08.56]You did it.
[387:10.73]Did I?
[387:11.01]Hey, I did it.
[387:13.01]Now where's that legendary chest?
[387:15.53]How much money do you have?
[387:17.57]Slow enemies on hit.
[387:18.87]That's probably good.
[387:21.00]Uh, 3,043.
[387:23.46]That's not enough.
[387:24.36]I think it's 37.
[387:25.44]What was the required amount?
[387:27.76]I think it was 37?
[387:28.96]Or was it 34?
[387:29.88]80?
[387:29.90]Alright, I'm just gonna pick up, like, this one thing and then come back.
[387:36.49]You need 300 more, I believe.
[387:44.41]These are green.
[387:46.88]Feather's a jump, right?
[387:48.86]This game's fucking bonkers.
[387:54.08]Always go with the random item.
[387:56.09]Could be anything.
[388:01.17]Alright.
[388:02.07]Is that all there is for me to get?
[388:05.18]Well, besides... Yeah, I think so.
[388:06.62]Unless you want to do the challenge mode right there.
[388:10.32]That's okay.
[388:22.32]Surprisingly little to pay for over this way.
[388:25.52]Turrets are still having a good time.
[388:27.66]So wait, if I die, my turrets just stay there?
[388:31.05]Uh, yes.
[388:32.57]That's strange.
[388:34.69]They do indeed.
[388:35.43]Alright, well.
[388:37.07]Ready to fight another day.
[388:38.27]I feel like that strategy will work on every other boss.
[388:46.71]Unless they can one-chunk you.
[388:48.23]Yeah.
[388:50.02]If they can kill you in one...
[388:53.27]That's 120, 120.
[388:53.49]That's 120 times 6.
[388:54.23]So that's... How much health is that a second?
[388:57.30]Yeah, you just have to make them strong enough to actually kill things quickly.
[389:07.12]Yeah, alright.
[389:07.78]Well, let's... Let's bring it up quickly.
[389:12.04]Did you just eat those?
[389:13.28]Is he eating these?
[389:15.54]Excuse me.
[389:16.87]I would like to ask a question.
[389:19.21]Is there a reason why I can't hit this guy?
[389:24.79]What?
[389:24.97]What are you eating?
[389:25.77]That was weird.
[389:27.97]That was strange.
[389:29.85]He was just inhaling them.
[389:37.84]Okay, let's go up here.
[389:41.94]Minimum arming distance?
[389:42.98]Probably.
[389:43.40]Something like that.
[389:44.20]Something weird.
[389:49.32]They're not killing him fast enough.
[389:51.38]Oh, I got a slug too.
[389:53.78]And...
[389:54.65]Even more attack speed.
[390:02.89]So this is back to level one, right?
[390:05.59]I believe so.
[390:05.97]This is the level one loop.
[390:09.17]Ow, that hurt.
[390:14.65]What the hell?
[390:15.67]Oh, it's a fire guy.
[390:16.53]Wow, I got super slow on him.
[390:20.40]Come on, please, get away from me.
[390:44.86]There's a boss up here.
[390:46.30]It's like one of those boss characters.
[390:47.82]Alright.
[390:52.86]Any sign of the thing?
[391:01.28]Uh, not yet.
[391:03.92]Yeah, that's like a boss.
[391:04.68]There's four or five of those as a boss.
[391:07.18]Oh, my.
[391:07.64]I mean, it's not a boss, but it's one of those boss characters.
[391:11.78]You fight five of them at the same time, right?
[391:15.41]What if I turn this on and didn't even tell him?
[391:18.57]What are you doing?
[391:20.59]I'm not gonna do that.
[391:21.27]This is our first, like, actual real we might actually beat the loop.
[391:26.71]maybe I'll uh come down to you because we don't want to get to haha level when we do this probably this like feels like I shouldn't be doing this but I it's just so counterproductive to move it's counterproductive range it feels so weird that's how I feel every day
[391:56.23]Alright, chest.
[392:07.66]Nice.
[392:08.50]Ooh.
[392:11.54]Any sign of it?
[392:15.06]Uh, I don't think so.
[392:15.80]Oh, yeah, here it is.
[392:18.80]Ready?
[392:19.62]No, no, no, wait, wait.
[392:20.27]We need to, like, get this situated.
[392:21.91]We need to be ready.
[392:22.67]We need to be in the same spot.
[392:24.35]I only have one turret available.
[392:27.01]Okay, here's one, two.
[392:28.85]I'm standing here, and I have five seconds for the next one.
[392:32.17]Okay, are you ready to stand still?
[392:34.45]Three, two, one.
[392:35.57]Here we go.
[392:36.37]We have to activate this before we get to ha-ha-ha.
[392:38.69]Okay, so... It's just this thing.
[392:41.48]Just stand still and spam.
[392:51.78]Am I hitting them by own?
[392:53.30]What the fuck?
[392:53.94]What?
[392:57.08]Why?
[392:57.78]What was that?
[392:58.54]Was that his?
[392:59.18]I don't know what was just happening.
[393:00.52]I only had one portal down.
[393:03.12]No, you've got a... No, but why was it bouncing?
[393:07.24]What a pro strat this is.
[393:10.68]Oh, and then you fly.
[393:12.50]As long as you don't fly too far.
[393:17.96]Here he comes.
[393:18.36]He's going to step on us now.
[393:19.74]Oh, that hurts.
[393:20.56]I'm so scared.
[393:21.20]I feel like I should need to move.
[393:23.53]I'm on top of him.
[393:25.21]One down, one to go.
[393:28.29]We're not even in ha ha ha land yet.
[393:30.27]This is fucking stupid.
[393:32.19]The Rancho Relaxo strategy.
[393:37.38]This really is like the meme build.
[393:43.40]Where is he?
[393:43.92]Over there?
[393:49.50]Where's the other actual... I can't see.
[393:51.19]There's too many fucking Reinhardt shits.
[393:52.47]There's too much green goo.
[393:54.29]There's too many Winstons on our team.
[393:55.85]I don't know where we are.
[394:01.32]It works until it doesn't, is this trap.
[394:04.88]Yeah, that's true.
[394:06.34]Where is the actual boss?
[394:09.81]We got to 99% charge.
[394:11.55]I'm going to move.
[394:12.23]I know that's not allowed, really.
[394:14.75]Moving.
[394:15.63]Okay, fine.
[394:15.97]Let's go.
[394:18.07]Let's find him.
[394:22.43]Is that him over there?
[394:23.19]Yeah, it's him all the way down there.
[394:24.84]Alright, move.
[394:26.36]We're going to pick up Shroff.
[394:27.02]We're going to do the same thing over here.
[394:28.04]Uh-oh.
[394:28.76]Uh-oh.
[394:29.96]Uh-oh.
[394:31.94]Gotta get some heal babies down.
[394:32.96]Uh-oh, we're separated.
[394:42.50]We should be okay.
[394:45.44]Your shield is deflecting all my attacks.
[395:02.16]Alright, I'm moving up.
[395:03.44]Moving it, why?
[395:04.10]To you.
[395:04.92]Because I was behind you.
[395:08.54]Plus, we heal each other.
[395:09.62]We did it.
[395:11.70]We did it.
[395:12.40]Now, just pick up the pieces.
[395:14.14]Now, just maybe a few more items?
[395:19.10]We just got the ha-ha-ha difficulty.
[395:21.08]We did.
[395:21.42]Alright, there's a ukulele here for you.
[395:25.62]Oh, yeah.
[395:26.77]I'll get that on the way out.
[395:31.29]Alright, boxes.
[395:32.57]Alright, we're in Ha Ha Ha.
[395:36.14]We have one more after this, right?
[395:39.68]I think so.
[395:40.70]So the ideology here is to get to the portal as fast as possible and do our impenetrable fort.
[395:48.32]Yeah, before it gets too far down the Ha Ha Ha train.
[395:50.61]I don't see any loot, so I'm just going to come get the thing by the teleporter.
[395:53.49]Yeah, let's just get the hell out of here.
[395:54.49]We'll level up a few times.
[395:55.97]Let me grab my boss gear.
[396:02.00]Right here.
[396:07.57]And let's get the hell out of here.
[396:12.61]Ow.
[396:12.71]That way I got some good max HP.
[396:15.35]Alright.
[396:16.37]Tactic.
[396:17.93]Go find as fast as possible.
[396:21.08]Find... the teleporter.
[396:25.62]And then set up shop.
[396:27.26]And let's get out of this.
[396:28.40]Let's do it.
[396:37.47]Good tactic.
[396:37.95]I like being up here and we can see down.
[396:39.27]I don't see any particles.
[396:51.66]What's hurting me?
[396:52.92]What's hurting me?
[396:53.84]What is hurting?
[396:54.54]Oh, did I go out of bounds?
[396:55.52]You can go out of bounds in this game?
[396:57.17]Yes.
[397:05.63]Watch for the red rope all the way around the edge.
[397:12.73]Alright.
[397:13.43]Gotta keep looking here.
[397:20.38]So far I got nothing.
[397:21.66]What's over here?
[397:25.52]It's being blocked by a titan.
[397:28.16]No.
[397:29.72]My god.
[397:30.63]Are you gonna be okay?
[397:33.05]I don't know.
[397:35.52]What is that RP talk like?
[397:37.00]I don't know.
[397:38.70]I just don't know.
[397:39.60]What's that?
[397:40.00]Oh, um, oh, I think, uh, this thing.
[397:43.86]Yep.
[397:44.66]Slug.
[397:47.86]Okay, it's right up here.
[397:51.86]Alright, are you ready?
[397:53.57]Sorry, I got Paul's goat hoof for move faster.
[397:56.73]I don't know why you would need anything that useless.
[397:59.15]Oh god.
[398:00.91]We gotta get over to that thing.
[398:02.73]Where is it?
[398:03.25]It's over here.
[398:04.27]Oh, fuck!
[398:07.78]We gotta do the strategy.
[398:08.62]We're useless without the strategy.
[398:10.74]Oh, yeah.
[398:11.52]Definitely.
[398:11.82]Okay, ready?
[398:12.96]I'm on it.
[398:13.48]I don't know where you are.
[398:14.20]Come to me.
[398:15.46]Ping the... Oh.
[398:16.30]I got pinged.
[398:18.10]Okay.
[398:18.80]You know where we are?
[398:19.40]Pretty close.
[398:20.22]Yeah.
[398:20.66]I'm just gonna... I'm starting strategy A. Oh, God.
[398:24.64]I'm, like, left behind in the zombie apocalypse.
[398:26.54]I'm coming.
[398:28.04]It's still... Oh, my God.
[398:29.02]I need you.
[398:30.34]I'm here.
[398:30.94]I need you.
[398:31.34]I need your other heal.
[398:32.04]Alright.
[398:33.86]I'm gonna stand still.
[398:35.97]Oh, Jesus.
[398:37.93]They breached.
[398:39.25]Alright, press the button.
[398:39.97]One of the engineer turrets is dead.
[398:44.04]Oh my god.
[398:45.60]It's too spiky.
[398:46.26]Damage is too spiky.
[398:48.32]Hold on.
[398:49.36]Have faith.
[398:50.48]Hold.
[398:53.33]I bought us some time with my... Oh, I'm dead.
[398:57.53]Diddly dead.
[399:08.19]Well, we did hold the line.
[399:09.75]We will definitely get some kind of medal for that, I think.
[399:14.28]God damn it.
[399:15.64]Why?
[399:16.00]It worked until it didn't.
[399:21.18]That was so long.
[399:24.49]What time is it?
[399:27.11]Eleven.
[399:28.99]Seven hours.
[399:29.57]That's so unfortunate.
[399:33.35]Not much else we can unlock except...
[399:38.99]You'd have to get the 10 points, which would probably take a few hours.
[399:43.88]Obliterate yourself at the obelisk.
[399:45.90]Is that the, like, you beat all the things guy?
[399:51.89]I think that when we beat that, I think we go to the obelisk.
[399:58.25]I don't even know what killed us.
[400:03.16]What even did that much damage?
[400:04.62]That was just a... It was just an explosion, yeah.
[400:12.69]Seventh stage is the portal option for obliteration.
[400:14.95]That unlocks a character.
[400:15.93]That's cool.
[400:16.99]There's three greater wisps shooting at the same time.
[400:20.21]A beetle queen bomb.
[400:24.84]Well, that was fun.
[400:26.58]Yeah, that was fun.
[400:28.85]For something in early access that just came in early access randomly for just... There it is.
[400:33.00]Uh... That was good.
[400:36.96]Yep.
[400:37.38]And there's still two more characters and I guess four more to be added.
[400:41.44]And I'm going to... 20 bucks.
[400:45.22]Fairly reasonable as well.
[400:46.34]I would... Obviously.
[400:48.72]We'll probably see much more content.
[400:51.49]Yeah.
[400:52.47]Added in the coming months.
[400:57.19]Yeah, it's good stuff.
[400:58.25]No, that was cool.
[400:59.17]It's really smooth.
[401:00.45]The only complaint, really, I had was the fire damage, but that's apparently a bug, so... Yeah, it's just really addictive getting a super build.
[401:12.37]Yeah, it was fun.
[401:16.17]And the co-op seems smooth.
[401:19.43]I think we can disband the squad.
[401:25.05]What happens if I do this?
[401:29.97]I'm still in the squad.
[401:31.23]Oh, you're still in the squad.
[401:32.13]You're never going to leave the squad.
[401:33.44]I'll always be in the squad.
[401:36.04]RIP squad.
[401:39.68]Anyways, that was fun.
[401:41.50]There was Risk of Rain 2 co-op.
[401:43.12]That was Etalyx.
[401:45.20]Go say hello.
[401:45.76]Go give him a follow.
[401:47.27]Oh.
[401:47.65]If you haven't already.
[401:48.35]I was like, where is he?
[401:51.27]You're here.
[401:54.65]I'm sorry to say this, but we're disbanding the squad.
[401:59.67]Yeah, we're gonna, um, cut the house in two.
[402:04.25]And draw just a big line down the middle.
[402:08.51]The squad.
[402:10.63]But, yeah, thanks for playing.
[402:11.55]After the microwave gets caught, then.
[402:15.29]It's always a pleasure, Mr. Etalyx.
[402:19.07]End of squad voice.
[402:20.27]And I will see you, Etalyx, in, like, 30 minutes or so, uh, when we both, like, eat snacks downstairs.
[402:28.02]Alright.
[402:28.48]Well, thanks for having me, guys.
[402:31.96]I've been told I've been very loud.
[402:33.38]I'm sorry.
[402:34.28]That's not my fault.
[402:35.66]I turned you down.
[402:38.10]I've been told I'm turned down.
[402:39.48]Very quiet.
[402:40.11]Not my fault.
[402:42.33]Hold on.
[402:42.97]But if I could do it over again, I would be even louder.
[402:46.09]I turned him down.
[402:48.59]I got confirmation that you were fine.
[402:50.31]I would be at least twice as loud.
[402:53.76]What?
[402:55.72]If I had the choice.
[402:58.63]I... I... We talked about it like two hours, three hours ago.
[403:04.89]And they were like, turn it down a little.
[403:05.99]I turned it down.
[403:10.97]Good night, guys.
[403:12.99]See you next time.
[403:17.46]So wait, was he really loud that whole time?
[403:19.94]Because on my end, it looks like he was fine.
[403:25.62]The first couple hours... Oh, he was fine.
[403:30.36]Oh, you're just fucking around.
[403:32.00]Oh, okay.
[403:35.38]For the first couple hours, I think he was a little loud, but... I turned him down halfway through.
[403:41.18]Come on, man.
[403:41.92]You guys are making me feel crazy.
[403:45.10]But that's it.
[403:46.90]Let me get this off the screen here.
[403:50.52]I will see you guys tomorrow for the Sekiro scratch-off, if you don't know what that is.
[403:56.60]Tomorrow...
[403:59.36]I'm going to be scratching $221 worth of scratch tickets for every dollar, every death in Sekiro.
[404:11.59]It's going to be just to hang out, just stream.
[404:17.26]Any cent that is made through that, I've picked the charity I'm going to be using that I'm going to be donating to.
[404:26.77]Now the charity is going to be the Nevada Humane Society.
[404:36.16]Very highly rated charity.
[404:46.30]And regardless of how much money is made on that stream, at least $221 is going to go to the Nevada Humane Society.
[405:00.95]Because if I get zero dollars on these tickets, that don't matter.
[405:06.79]If it's 50 grand, beautiful.
[405:16.04]And then after that, to keep in line with the gambling thing, I'm gonna make sure that it works.
[405:23.28]It should.
[405:25.04]Somebody made a Jerma Slots game that is a full game.
[405:31.45]has a bunch of mini games in it it's like a full experience and we're gonna play it should be an interesting day and that'll be starting around the normal time of three to four pm thanks for joining tonight
[406:01.30]A chill stream where we just kind of play.
[406:04.24]It's fun sometimes just to kind of turn the brain off and enjoy a game with your friend.
[406:16.09]And with that, we can go ahead and go like this.
[406:28.46]Pull up the bits.
[406:31.51]Thank you for joining me again.
[406:33.03]See you tomorrow.
[406:38.76]I can't wait to see him win a million dollars.
[406:40.44]That would be insane.
[406:42.98]Was a max possible win on a $5 ticket?
[406:45.02]I really don't know.
[406:48.52]I really don't know.
[406:49.28]I know that the more... The higher the denomination is, let's say if it's a $20 ticket, that chance to win is much higher.
[407:00.49]But I really have no idea what the maximum is.
[407:04.63]I don't know.
[407:08.49]Oh, that's be right back.
[407:09.72]That's incorrect.
[407:13.08]Hey, there we go.
[407:16.74]The ticket will say the max price on it?
[407:18.68]Yeah, it should.
[407:20.64]It should.
[407:21.22]But, uh, it when... It when we, thanks to the $5...
[407:28.42]Oh my goodness.
[407:28.72]That's so fancy!
[407:54.52]That's crazy.
[407:55.56]That's... I look forward to see what that entails.
[408:00.92]Jeremy on vinyl.
[408:05.66]Thank you though, Iwan.
[408:08.12]The yellowist thanks for the 350.
[408:09.52]I was gifted a community sub during Monster Rancher and just didn't want to be a complete bum.
[408:15.24]Go blow this on the slots.
[408:19.51]You're not a bum.
[408:23.74]If you participate in this community, then you participate in this community and you're great.
[408:28.04]Don't worry about giving me money.
[408:30.28]Thanks for the $3.50, though.
[408:33.42]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $2.50.
[408:34.24]What's going on, Lazy Luke?
[408:36.82]Hope you're doing well.
[408:41.40]$5 from Frodeon Weapon.
[408:44.42]Thank you, Frodeon.
[408:45.92]Hey, Jerma, thanks for streaming on my birthday.
[408:47.96]Happy birthday again, Frodeon.
[408:50.09]Hope you had a good one.
[408:52.25]None of my friends are around to party tonight, so this is a good way to celebrate on my own.
[408:56.47]Can't wait to see what crazy ideas of yours come to fruition as we approach the summer months.
[409:00.88]Hope you and chat have a good night.
[409:02.18]Much love.
[409:07.26]Happy birthday, Ferodion.
[409:08.06]A very valued member of the community.
[409:14.08]Been around for a long time.
[409:15.48]Happy birthday.
[409:20.78]And yes, the summer months will bring hopefully some very interesting streams.
[409:26.52]We will see.
[409:31.04]Adventure Dan, Adventure MF Dan, thanks for the five dollars.
[409:34.34]Hey Jerma, I'm visiting Vegas next weekend.
[409:37.18]Any cool things I should do?
[409:40.58]Keep on rockin'.
[409:42.88]It depends on what you like to do.
[409:45.47]Because Vegas has anything you want.
[409:50.06]Anything you desire is here.
[409:51.92]It's just here.
[409:55.75]Concerts, casinos, some of the best restaurants in the country.
[410:02.55]It's got anything.
[410:05.39]Arcades, bars, clubs.
[410:14.56]The best thing you can... Okay, if you've never been to Vegas before,
[410:20.44]The best first thing to do is just to kind of walk around and just take a look.
[410:32.17]Walk the strip, or at least part of it, because it's about a two-hour walk to do the whole thing.
[410:41.35]There's a lot of interesting things to see.
[410:42.85]There's the fountain at the Bellagio that has the dancing fountain to music.
[410:52.68]It really depends on what you want to do.
[410:53.76]There's so much to see that it's hard to recommend.
[410:57.38]You could open up, like, Ticketmaster right now.
[411:01.41]And just see the dozens of shows and concerts that are going on this week.
[411:10.04]I heard you can gamble there.
[411:10.92]You can.
[411:11.84]It is.
[411:12.18]You can do it.
[411:15.64]But hope you have fun.
[411:16.24]Hope you have a blast.
[411:20.11]There's no shortage of things to do here.
[411:23.02]You'll find something.
[411:25.06]But thank you for the $5.
[411:28.04]Also, I want to say thank you to Tomato, raided with like a thousand people earlier.
[411:33.16]Thanks so much, Tomato.
[411:35.12]Everyone that came in from Tomato's stream.
[411:39.86]Thanks for coming out.
[411:40.72]Thanks for sticking around.
[411:50.62]Wish me luck on this quiz.
[411:52.14]Good luck on your quiz on Monday.
[411:53.26]You're gonna do just... You're gonna do great.
[411:58.36]Solharv.
[411:59.89]Solharv.
[412:00.59]Thank you for the $2.50.
[412:01.45]Hey, Jerma.
[412:02.51]An actor from The Quiet Man left the following comment on the second Jerma video.
[412:07.35]What?
[412:10.28]Okay, I'm the actor that plays the birdman and father, and I had a laugh and a chuckle with one snort over this.
[412:17.32]Nice job.
[412:21.32]That's so funny.
[412:22.84]What a- that's a- it's about a good sport, right?
[412:30.99]Acting, I don't think, was a major problem.
[412:38.27]Just the game was just all over the place.
[412:42.99]That's so funny.
[412:43.77]What a good sport.
[412:51.05]They really commented.
[412:52.59]That's cool.
[412:53.95]I think that's cool.
[412:57.59]But thank you so hard for the $2.50.
[412:58.85]The guy that plays the father.
[413:06.29]Hey CreepyT, thanks for five bucks.
[413:07.82]Thank you for streaming today.
[413:08.66]Thank you for watching today.
[413:11.24]Welcome.
[413:13.08]Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[413:15.84]Seeing as you are a gamer, how much do you identify with the Joker?
[413:19.82]Also, do an orc impression.
[413:23.47]What's with the orc impressions?
[413:26.71]How much do I identify with the Joker?
[413:28.05]I don't really identify with the Joker.
[413:33.01]I think I'm more of a Riddler, if you ask me.
[413:38.11]Do an orc impression.
[413:41.69]Job's done.
[413:42.83]That's a peasant.
[413:43.63]Peon, right?
[413:44.39]Forget it.
[413:46.61]Thanks for the $2.50.
[413:47.37]Freudian Weapon, $2.50.
[413:49.63]Happy birthday again.
[413:52.23]You know, I honestly couldn't think of a better way to spend my birthday than having some drinks and watching my favorite streamer.
[413:57.19]I say it all the time, but thanks for being such an inspiration.
[413:59.89]You in this community have the uncanny ability of cheering me up when I feel the most absolute, like, absolute garbage.
[414:05.66]I read that wrong.
[414:07.22]And you got me back into making art.
[414:08.94]Awesome.
[414:09.90]So for that, I thank you.
[414:16.05]If I can inspire anybody to do anything, that's fucking incredible.
[414:20.23]Thank you.
[414:24.39]I'm honored and glad that you are getting back into doing something that you like to do.
[414:33.13]Thank you for being part of this community.
[414:35.37]Thank you for the $2.50.
[414:39.99]That's awesome.
[414:40.65]I'm glad you're doing it.
[414:42.39]Keep doing it.
[414:47.30]Thank you so much, Freudian Weapon.
[414:49.41]And again, happy birthday.
[414:52.15]PikaBanana, thanks for the $5.
[414:52.97]Fun stream today.
[414:54.07]Can't wait for the Scratchers for charity tomorrow.
[414:58.41]Should be interesting.
[415:03.71]I'm looking forward to it.
[415:06.03]Juno Upseto, thanks for the $2.50.
[415:07.49]Someone in the Discord wants to know how to solve this.
[415:12.29]What is this?
[415:14.47]Uh...
[415:18.05]How do you solve that?
[415:20.59]I gotta work backwards?
[415:26.03]How am I gonna do that without working backwards?
[415:28.60]Is it not solved?
[415:32.92]How do I solve this?
[415:34.26]6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2... I think you obviously got something going on here in the middle.
[415:46.98]That 14 space 4?
[415:49.06]That should be connecting, shouldn't it?
[415:51.02]Or not?
[415:54.90]Solve it for him.
[415:55.56]I can't.
[415:56.72]You're gonna have to look up the game guide.
[416:02.92]But thank you guys.
[416:04.75]Here come the credits.
[416:07.85]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[416:09.49]For an IRL stream into a slot machine stream.
[416:12.83]It's a gambling day tomorrow.
[416:14.03]But it's not, I mean, it's like...
[416:16.49]It is, but it isn't.
[416:24.29]Gambling streamer.
[416:25.33]Does that mean I have to go into the category on stream?
[416:29.16]The gambling casino category.
[416:33.44]Do I?
[416:33.78]I think I do.
[416:36.70]Could this be IRL?
[416:42.53]Opening loot boxes.
[416:50.27]The name of that title of that stream should be, Jerma Bare Minimum Loses $442.
[416:54.09]Put it in the Sekiro category.
[417:06.94]That's fucking hilarious.
[417:13.26]But here come the credits.
[417:15.01]Thank you to all the subs.
[417:19.07]See if you can see your name.
[417:20.19]It's gonna be blown by here in a second.
[417:26.41]Put it under Dwarf Fortress.
[417:27.81]Why would I put it under Dwarf Fortress?
[417:34.02]Don't you still need to pay income tax on lotto winnings?
[417:36.50]No, I don't think so, because... I was talking about this with a few people.
[417:43.30]Casino winnings are just taxed.
[417:46.54]I don't think they count as income.
[417:49.28]So if I win a million dollars on a scratch ticket, I believe a portion of that, like 20-30% of that is just taxed.
[417:59.75]I don't think it counts as income on my tax return.
[418:05.50]Is a lottery ticket income?
[418:17.04]Are gambling winnings income?
[418:22.78]Gambling winnings are fully taxable and you must report the income on your tax return.
[418:25.98]Gambling income includes but is not limited to winnings from lotteries, raffles, casinos, includes cash winnings.
[418:32.43]Income.
[418:33.57]Is it?
[418:36.53]How do gambling winnings affect tax- If your winnings are reported on a form W2G, federal taxes are withheld at a flat rate of 25%.
[418:43.26]Okay.
[418:46.85]But does that mean... We'll fucking figure it out.
[418:53.92]I'm pretty certain that if I win a million dollars on a ticket tomorrow, $250,000 goes to the IRS.
[419:01.98]And then that's just it.
[419:07.93]I believe that's correct.
[419:08.57]I don't think that affects my actual income for 2019.
[419:18.33]And then, okay, so that's gonna be strange.
[419:19.95]So, okay, if I take in... Let's say it does affect income.
[419:24.81]So... If I win a million dollars on a scratch ticket and it affects income... Okay, so you made a million dollars in 2019 and you donated $750,000 to charity.
[419:33.00]I'm gonna have to, like...
[419:47.25]I'm fairly certain that's not how it works.
[419:50.03]Donations are deductible.
[419:51.19]So what?
[419:51.81]I had $750,000 in expenses in 2019?
[419:59.16]Just mail them the ticket.
[420:00.56]They'll deal with it.
[420:06.06]Win the money, then go to H&R Block on stream and say, what do I do?
[420:16.06]By the way, this is assuming that I'm going to win a million dollars on this.
[420:20.46]What like a gambling fallacy?
[420:24.47]I'll be lucky if I win like a hundred bucks tomorrow.
[420:29.23]But there's a possibility that I could win like 50 grand and then 50 grand, that goes right to the Nevada Humane Society.
[420:42.96]What if you win one dollar?
[420:44.71]It gets rounded up to 221.
[420:48.93]Double or nothing after tomorrow's stream.
[420:50.99]I know people are already going to be saying that.
[421:01.36]I'm not going to do a, like, scratching for Sekiro deaths and then whatever is won for charity and win nine dollars and send nine dollars.
[421:12.42]I mean, like... We're doing like a whole event here for this.
[421:17.82]Like, I'm gonna do at least 200... I'm gonna give at least $221.
[421:19.82]Don't even worry.
[421:24.90]Look.
[421:25.99]I am going... I'm gonna hit like $1,000 tomorrow.
[421:32.49]Just watch.
[421:32.87]I'm gonna hit like fucking two or three grand on these tickets tomorrow.
[421:43.65]But anyways, I got one more bit to do.
[421:45.75]I got one more that trickled in here.
[421:50.35]And it was... Who was it?
[421:57.55]It was something or other thanks to the 250.
[422:00.02]It's a terrible day for rain.
[422:01.20]Remember to bring your umbrella.
[422:04.44]I never have an umbrella.
[422:05.62]I just run.
[422:08.46]Wherever I need to go outside in the rain, I just run as fast as I can.
[422:16.04]same yeah a lot of people do that and then at the very end snoozing copter thanks for 250. no wait GarfieldTheMondayKiller just came in but thank you snoozing copter since we're in such a humble mood right now I really appreciate this community too I've been a fan for a long time and I watched the streams from the very beginning but I've only really been really involved in the community for like two years
[422:37.70]Getting in touch with the nicest people.
[422:39.62]Now, Holy Mac was so kind to commission me to draw a few thumbnails for Second Jerma.
[422:45.50]Like the Lethal League one.
[422:46.50]Yeah, I did that.
[422:48.02]And I'm really happy I can give something back like that.
[422:51.40]Yeah.
[422:59.16]It's amazing what people do in this community.
[423:00.68]It's amazing that people...
[423:05.85]can all be collectively in the same place, think the same things are interesting, and make a bunch of great shit.
[423:15.79]It's awesome.
[423:26.79]But thank you, Snooze and Cofter, for the $2.50 and your contributions to the community.
[423:33.03]No, I did that.
[423:36.15]Somebody did.
[423:40.01]And then finally, GarfieldTheMondayKiller for $2.50.
[423:41.75]This is in all caps.
[423:43.95]For some reason, I don't know why you're screaming at me.
[423:45.55]Garfield's coming in here at the last second to say, hey, it's Fat Albert.
[423:50.20]And Garf's gonna sing a song for you, and Jerma's gonna tell you a thing or two.
[423:54.22]Hey, Jerma the Llama, have you ever been to Bedrock, USA?
[423:57.64]It's a creepy ghost town modeled after the Flintstones.
[424:00.64]It's honestly eerie, since there's weird mannequins and cavemen costumes.
[424:05.49]It's weird.
[424:05.91]I got a ride called Garfield's Nightmare.
[424:09.73]My nightmare is the bit cap being increased.
[424:13.03]Careful, Garfield.
[424:15.17]I might make it five dollars.
[424:22.22]I'm not gonna do- I'm not doing that.
[424:23.90]Kidding.
[424:29.16]I'm kidding, I'm just not- it's not gonna happen.
[424:35.53]But thank you, Garfield.
[424:36.69]I don't- I've never heard of Bedrock USA.
[424:43.58]Seems like a fucked up place.
[424:46.93]And that is my time tonight.
[424:50.65]See you tomorrow.
[424:53.41]Have a fantastic rest of your evening.
[424:57.53]And get tucked in tonight in bed.
[424:59.63]And get like cuddled under the blankets.
[425:00.91]It's going to be cold out there.
[425:05.03]See you tomorrow for Sekiro, Scratch Off, and Jerma Slots.
[425:10.13]Have a great night.
[425:11.45]No, I'm not going to run ads.
[425:12.45]Good night.
[425:15.43]I will do stream legends, though.
[425:16.85]You know, you got me there.
[425:17.93]That's true.
[425:23.07]Here's your stream legends.
[425:25.78]Loot.
[425:27.20]That was Risk of Rain 2.
[425:30.44]For early access, it seems like there's a lot to do.
[425:36.02]It's pretty good.
[425:36.78]Pretty fun.
[425:38.56]Here's your loot for stream legends.
[425:41.12]See you guys tomorrow.
