[02:43.93]We're only playing this until... By the way, fucking... Sprayed that air duster making a sneeze joke and now it smells like chemicals in here.
[02:51.66]My nose is irritated now.
[02:54.58]I did it one time.
[02:56.34]Why do they sell this stuff?
[02:59.68]This stuff shouldn't be sold in stores.
[03:02.36]You should have to bring your computer keyboard into, like, the dry cleaner.
[03:07.30]This should be a computer keyboard dry cleaner.
[03:09.23]This should be a PC dry cleaner.
[03:16.59]Every stream needs a joke gone wrong and there's nothing went wrong.
[03:19.53]I just I'm telling you guys That this should be a dry cleaner for computers Hey hall of one zombie thanks for the one dollar they say weasel.
[03:31.16]I don't know.
[03:32.44]I'm not sure.
[03:32.78]Why am I a weasel?
[03:33.70]I don't maybe I am Sticks thanks for the one dollar.
[03:37.90]Let's talk about school lunches.
[03:39.02]How was your school lunch?
[03:40.82]Middle school was the best.
[03:42.48]High school lunches sucked, except for Sloppy Joe.
[03:44.68]I remember there was a food fight, and my right ear was bombarded by a single tuna sub sandwich.
[03:51.43]Oh yeah, there was always that guy.
[03:53.77]The greatest thing about high school lunch, and here's another thing that I don't understand.
[03:58.61]You're gonna put a bunch of fucking children, a bunch of young kids who've got all kinds of changes going on.
[04:07.26]You know, you've got like puberty, you've got all these fucking things that are going on in a kid's brain and a kid's body.
[04:13.51]You're gonna stuff all these kids, like 400 of them, into a room with a bunch of lunch and a bunch of food everywhere?
[04:20.66]What are you thinking?
[04:22.98]Dude, I remember a meatball sub was thrown across the lunchroom like two or three days a week at my school.
[04:31.40]It was not even exciting anymore.
[04:33.70]It got to a point where you were just, it was like watching a fucking bird fly across your radar.
[04:38.68]Who cares?
[04:39.74]Oh, there's another full meatball sub.
[04:41.38]It will hit that table over there?
[04:42.92]Oh, oh, okay.
[04:45.59]Oranges, fucking full chocolate milks hitting walls.
[04:49.73]It became, it wasn't even funny anymore.
[04:52.11]It was just like, there it is.
[04:53.19]That just happens twice, three times a week.
[04:58.05]That doesn't happen at your school?
[05:01.21]Wait, that doesn't happen at your school.
[05:04.97]Oh no, it can't happen anymore.
[05:06.34]I forgot because there's cameras now.
[05:09.24]There weren't cameras back when I was in school.
[05:12.15]People would throw lunches.
[05:15.96]Okay, I'm gonna tell you a story.
[05:17.75]This is an important story.
[05:19.41]So, I remember eating lunch.
[05:22.59]I brought my lunch to school this one time.
[05:24.43]I don't really talk to him that much anymore.
[05:27.15]We've since gone like separate ways.
[05:28.49]It's fine.
[05:29.47]But a friend of mine who was sitting across the lunch table from me.
[05:32.98]I had a full sandwich.
[05:34.52]It was ham, cheddar cheese, and lettuce with a little bit of mayonnaise.
[05:38.16]I'll never forget the name of the sandwich.
[05:39.50]I'll never forget what was in it.
[05:41.06]So I took one bite of the sandwich, and we were talking about video games or something.
[05:45.25]Like, oh, did you play Mario Sunshine?
[05:47.91]I don't even know what the game was.
[05:49.19]This is a long time ago.
[05:50.77]I took one bite of my sandwich, full sandwich, two hands on it, chewing, pulled it down.
[05:56.85]This kid reaches across the table, grabs my full sandwich out of my fucking hands, and does like an alley-oop backwards behind his head.
[06:08.91]Just throws it in the air behind him.
[06:11.84]And I just watched my sandwich careen across the whole lunchroom.
[06:19.23]That shit happened all the time.
[06:20.27]Yeah, and then he, like, shared his fries with me.
[06:29.92]Yeah, crazy shit can't happen like that anymore because, like, there's cameras in the lunchroom.
[06:34.74]This was back in the Wild West.
[06:43.70]The Wild West, where, like, people would... Do you guys still have those, um... You know those little cups?
[06:51.52]Those little juice cups?
[06:53.62]You peel off the weird, gross foil lid, and there's, like, a little half-quarter serving of fruit punch in there?
[07:02.19]Do they still have those at school?
[07:06.83]I would hope so, because they were the best part of all of lunch.
[07:09.63]They were the best part.
[07:12.50]Those sucked.
[07:13.12]No, what are you talking about?
[07:14.25]Those things were the best.
[07:15.73]Those were the best things ever.
[07:17.55]Because they would get really, really frozen and slushy because they were stored completely improperly.
[07:25.00]They were stored at like negative eight degrees Celsius for some reason.
[07:29.18]So half of it was frozen and you kind of had to punch at it with your fork and break it all up and suck it up and slurp up the slushy.
[07:36.09]It was perfect.
[07:36.71]It was awesome.
[07:41.29]Here are the Zimbinis, by the way.
[07:46.54]It was just a juice.
[07:47.54]It was perfect.
[07:48.54]Hopefully you guys still have those.
[07:52.46]No, those sucked when you have sensitive teeth.
[07:58.65]Well, I'm sorry that you couldn't enjoy them.
[08:02.73]But yeah, one of those... One of the terrible fucking awful things is... I remember... Because that shit's stained.
[08:08.49]Stained.
[08:10.39]And I remember people would peel up a corner of that shit, they would peel a corner, shake it up, really lightly to make it so the ice broke up, and then they would like spin it and throw it into the fucking air, and you'd get a spiral of this gross sugar stain liquid that would just hit like 45 people.
[08:31.14]And it was just like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[08:35.14]It was like a sprinkler of shitty fruit punch.
[08:41.16]Don't be that guy.
[08:42.46]Don't be that kid.
[08:43.28]Because guess what?
[08:46.32]That kid ends up going to like jail.
[08:48.98]That kid goes to jail.
[08:55.64]This is a terrible joke.
[08:57.38]This is not a joke.
[08:58.47]I'm not making this up.
[09:00.07]This shit was real.
[09:00.97]This was real life for me.
[09:06.93]You think this is a made-up story?
[09:08.29]It is not a fucking made-up story.
[09:12.95]I've been hit in the face with a full mini milk before.
[09:18.72]It bounced off the fucking wall and came back and hit me right in the face.
[09:22.35]It's happened.
[09:23.21]And it was just like, oh, that shit just kind of happens.
[09:25.59]Well, whoops-a-daisy.
[09:26.87]Wipe off my glasses and get back to school.
[09:28.96]Get back to class.
[09:37.82]Speed run.
[09:38.72]Alright, anyways, so let me explain what's going on.
[09:40.44]Like, I went off the fucking deep end there.
[09:44.24]Point is, don't be a fucking asshole to throw shit at lunch.
[09:48.76]Anyways.
[09:50.72]Yeah, so tonight, we're gonna play Little Zumbini's Mountain Rescue while we wait for Kryken...
[09:57.47]And his kind of friends or his crew or whatever to play Intruder.
[10:03.39]That's why we didn't start.
[10:04.31]That's why we've been waiting to start.
[10:05.83]Because I wanted to make sure we got as many people as possible.
[10:09.62]Etalyx is probably going to join us.
[10:11.84]So it's probably going to be like a shit show in like an hour.
[10:15.94]There's probably going to be like 12 people in this call.
[10:19.16]So fair warning, when we play Intruder, it's going to be a shit show.
[10:22.87]It's going to be fun probably.
[10:23.75]I don't even know what the game is.
[10:25.91]But we'll find out.
[10:29.01]Maybe Etalyx will join us too.
[10:31.07]He's streaming right now, I think.
[10:33.89]But yeah, that's what's going to happen.
[10:37.80]And I missed like a shitload of bits while I was on my fucking high school lunch throw tangent.
[10:41.76]So hold on, give me a minute.
[10:43.38]So we're kind of just like in chill mode at the moment.
[10:46.91]We're not necessarily trying to do much.
[10:49.87]Let's just... New player.
[10:55.49]How do I just like start the game?
[11:00.57]Oh, the disc has to spin up.
[11:03.39]Come on.
[11:05.25]Hey, look at that.
[11:05.77]Alright, so... Wait, wait, wait.
[11:06.87]Go back.
[11:08.07]I don't think we can even... Sign in.
[11:11.82]Not so easy.
[11:12.50]Oh, so hard.
[11:13.04]Alright, we'll just... What do we start?
[11:14.92]Candyland?
[11:17.20]Bully Boggle?
[11:18.74]Snowboard Gulch?
[11:20.94]Chef No... Oh, there's another chef one.
[11:22.72]Okay, hold on.
[11:24.20]I don't know where we start.
[11:24.86]Probably Turtle Hurdle.
[11:27.17]We'll do Oh, So Hard.
[11:28.07]We're gonna start... We'll do Turtle Hurdle.
[11:36.58]Alright, it's another bridge mechanic.
[11:39.66]Can you guys hear this CD spun up?
[11:46.58]Okay, I don't like that this game feels a little... This game feels worse than the last one.
[11:52.51]Okay.
[11:58.73]I guess you'd have to double click.
[11:59.67]So how do I determine who can... So this is the lion game.
[12:07.04]Remember the line game from the last one where people have to go in a row for some reason?
[12:10.20]Maybe it's hats.
[12:12.07]Yeah, it is.
[12:13.61]So this is gonna be hats up to here.
[12:16.93]Nope, apparently not.
[12:17.85]Not noses, is it shoes?
[12:22.29]I feel like we're having the same conversation.
[12:27.34]This is the same stream we had last night, exactly.
[12:31.20]This one is much uglier.
[12:34.80]Where's the narrator?
[12:38.05]This feels like a cereal box game.
[12:39.99]It does.
[12:42.03]Yeah, it's shoes.
[12:45.47]This ain't even real 3D.
[12:46.57]This is Super Mario RPG 3D.
[12:50.74]Whatever.
[12:54.44]Go to the other one?
[12:55.12]That's too late.
[12:55.76]I already set this one up.
[12:57.88]I already had to buy this on Amazon and have it shipped to me.
[13:00.14]So we're gonna play it for fucking 10 minutes.
[13:03.50]No, we're not going back to the old Zumbinis.
[13:05.34]Sorry.
[13:05.74]It's not gonna happen.
[13:09.62]Look, this ain't even the real stream.
[13:12.78]This is not the real stream.
[13:15.64]We've got time just to chill.
[13:16.69]We're just gonna chill.
[13:19.23]And talk about school lunch.
[13:20.65]There we go.
[13:23.41]Is the narrator at least come up and say anything?
[13:27.55]No.
[13:27.69]Okay, well, he doesn't.
[13:34.20]What about this one?
[13:34.80]Pipes of Paloo.
[13:38.17]Old Zumbini Zoe Riot.
[13:39.57]Well, good luck.
[13:42.13]This is... This is also from the last one.
[13:47.51]Because this is... You connect the... Remember this one?
[13:49.71]They go up the elevator.
[13:52.03]It's just a shittier looking version.
[13:54.54]Go back.
[13:55.06]I'm not doing that one.
[13:56.16]Aqua Cube.
[14:00.44]This one's different because this one has three-dimensional technology.
[14:04.74]That's fine.
[14:05.08]I'm looking over here and I'm seeing a riot.
[14:07.60]Um...
[14:09.59]Don't care.
[14:11.35]Okay.
[14:12.11]Don't.
[14:12.71]I don't.
[14:13.15]I don't give a shit.
[14:16.07]Right now, it's just like you guys are riding in the streets and I'm like, I'm like all the way up in like the top level of the tower looking down.
[14:22.78]Like, look at them down there.
[14:25.66]They think that they can stop me?
[14:28.96]They'll never stop me.
[14:31.22]I am so powerful.
[14:34.08]And then like in another hour or two, like the movie will end and I'll get what's coming to me, you know?
[14:41.15]I'll get what's coming to me.
[14:42.01]That's how the movie always ends like spider-man will come get me.
[14:44.95]What am I doing?
[14:47.48]They're all bunched up I can press a button What do these do okay, so it goes down across Alright, I got I got a couple people what okay we got We got everyone's going across now So this is to go up the plane this is to go across the plane
[15:12.11]Oh, that was a fleen.
[15:12.95]I wasn't supposed to get that guy.
[15:14.71]And we blew that one.
[15:15.47]Alright, whatever.
[15:17.23]Uh, what about this one?
[15:18.01]Bubble bumpers.
[15:22.12]Riot climb the tower.
[15:23.60]Get down.
[15:24.32]Get down.
[15:24.90]Get out of here.
[15:25.36]I'm like swatting down people.
[15:28.18]You guys are getting close and I got like a broom.
[15:30.32]I switched.
[15:30.88]I spin the handle around so it's not the broom part and I'm like I'm playing pool with you guys.
[15:36.58]Skulls.
[15:46.16]This is also from the last game.
[15:54.54]This is no different than the last one.
[15:57.77]I'm actually pretty disappointed.
[16:01.25]The other one was hand-drawn and fully animated.
[16:04.71]This one is just crappy 3D and they just went backwards.
[16:13.42]So what is this supposed to do?
[16:15.85]This is a bug, so I can move the bugs around.
[16:19.66]Even the music is worse!
[16:20.70]I don't even know what this is trying to tell me to do, because I can't... What do the zoom videos have to do with any of these puzzles?
[16:37.23]What did I expect?
[16:38.27]I expected a sequel!
[16:40.11]Alright, come on.
[16:40.97]They can really save us here.
[16:42.93]If the pizza people are back and this is like an ice cream version of that one.
[16:47.92]Redeem it.
[16:48.40]Come on.
[16:53.62]No.
[16:54.08]Okay.
[16:54.90]Nobody talks.
[16:59.28]What are these things?
[17:01.46]Alright, who wants an orange juice?
[17:04.61]An orange juice, a watermelon, and a sub sandwich.
[17:15.87]That was so awful that I'm actually angry at the developers.
[17:24.80]Huh?
[17:37.19]No, that's not what I ordered.
[17:40.35]Where's the pizazz?
[17:41.49]Where's the animation?
[17:42.55]Where's the guy?
[17:43.51]Where's like the acting?
[17:49.92]And why is it so hard to click on anything?
[18:00.00]That's not what I ordered.
[18:04.08]No, I'm sorry.
[18:06.92]Sorry, what is this, a school cafeteria?
[18:13.37]I've already given up.
[18:14.15]What about the, come on, the red guy's gotta say something funny.
[18:17.11]Sorry, that's not it.
[18:20.35]Oh shit, somebody just threw a pizza.
[18:22.15]You know how many times I was in detention when I was in high school?
[18:29.23]You know what's funny?
[18:30.09]This is a true story.
[18:31.55]I'm not kidding.
[18:32.23]This is not a fucking lie.
[18:33.87]This is a true 100% story.
[18:37.95]I was pulled into- I used to- I was late to school like every day.
[18:42.62]I swear to God.
[18:44.18]I was fucking late to school.
[18:46.46]Like four days a week.
[18:48.50]I got Saturday detention half the year because I was late almost every fucking day to school.
[18:55.39]My mother had to come in to school
[18:59.12]with me and sit down with the principal and they told me that I, like, broke the record for the amount of times that I was late to school and that that was unacceptable.
[19:10.71]I was late enough times where I got an award for it.
[19:13.35]I swear to God, that's not a fucking made-up story.
[19:22.97]Alright, this guy doesn't say anything yet.
[19:25.97]Nope, that's not it.
[19:27.75]This game sucks.
[19:29.51]This game sucks.
[19:33.40]What happened?
[19:33.98]Did they lose the game director?
[19:38.46]I'm not lying.
[19:39.80]I would never lie about that.
[19:41.80]What a stupid fucking thing to lie about.
[19:51.92]Oh man, this is bad.
[20:01.79]They had to have lost the game's director or something.
[20:04.49]Because I think this is, again, this is the same thing.
[20:08.72]They're just dumbed down and terrible.
[20:13.70]Did I just win?
[20:16.88]I did.
[20:20.22]What was the game?
[20:20.78]I won.
[20:21.41]I beat it in one try.
[20:24.93]Does anybody know what that was?
[20:35.90]Snowboard Gulch Really gonna have to stretch these next couple things cuz we have like 15-20 minutes before like Criken's ready to play this game What is this one?
[20:59.03]Reverse this and add the actually interesting cartoon characters and you go up instead of down.
[21:11.72]Now they did add interesting, not interesting cartoon characters.
[21:18.59]Really, that hurts.
[21:21.23]And this sounds like somebody's son did the voice acting.
[21:33.79]This is depresses me it does I didn't want to get like sad tonight Now you compare that to the fucking the three pizzas and I've done it like four times
[21:58.24]So, let's just get this right out of the way.
[22:00.66]Do not buy these games.
[22:03.83]Only get The Logical Journey of the Zumbinis.
[22:06.03]That's the one that's actually worth playing.
[22:11.95]Oh, shit.
[22:12.69]Do I only have one more game to play?
[22:18.51]Can we at least have to listen to the intro?
[22:24.27]This is the last level.
[22:26.30]Before we get to Candyland.
[22:30.00]There's a bunch of Tali impersonators.
[22:33.76]Am I gonna get solicited to smoke some marijuana here?
[22:35.68]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[22:45.01]How about down here?
[22:46.43]My computer is working hard.
[22:50.89]No, that's the desk spinning up intensely.
[22:56.40]They all have to be smiling, I guess.
[23:04.50]Yeah, it's just a cereal box game.
[23:08.94]That's all this turned into.
[23:09.86]And I always wondered, when I was younger, I never even heard of these ones.
[23:18.19]I played the first one, and that's the one that you should play.
[23:23.95]These ones, though, never, never, never did I ever... Was that not... Am I not supposed to do that?
[23:36.26]Can I get two?
[23:36.90]I need two balls.
[23:43.62]Now there's four.
[23:44.47]Is this going to do it?
[23:45.11]This might do it if I go here.
[23:46.81]I don't know.
[23:52.31]Fuck.
[23:57.63]There it is.
[23:58.29]Okay.
[23:59.31]Jump on down.
[24:02.13]Jump on down, you sorry excuses for Cinnamon Toast Crunch characters.
[24:05.78]Get the fuck out of here.
[24:10.92]It's just a bowling alley.
[24:22.83]I would just click the escape button right now, but I ain't doing it.
[24:28.43]I can't... I can't do it.
[24:32.29]This is what we get until we play Intruder.
[24:34.30]I'm sorry.
[24:34.92]I did not expect this.
[24:36.76]Who would ever have guessed that the sequel to The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis was a terrible cereal box game?
[24:43.94]There's another one.
[24:45.58]There's another game.
[24:48.14]I have it.
[24:48.54]It's right there.
[24:49.26]It's called Island Adventure or Island Odyssey or something.
[24:53.80]Is it as bad as this one?
[24:59.31]So this is where, like, okay, so you guys were rioting.
[25:01.99]So right now, you guys breached my office.
[25:05.46]And there's, like, 10,000 of you all swarming me, and I have my broom.
[25:09.48]And finally, like, I look over into the crowd, and I see, I, like, make eye contact with somebody.
[25:15.29]And you're waving, like, you're waving, like, the flag of the original Zumbini's game.
[25:21.31]And you're shaking it back and forth, and the time slows fucking down.
[25:26.33]And in that moment, right before the fucking movie ends, I finally, we do a flashback where it's my whole life coming up to this point and how the logical journey to Zumbini's was a better game and all the happiness it gave people.
[25:39.82]And as the crowd fucking just kills me, as the crowd gets on, just stabs me and is like murdering me and ripping out my intestines and shit.
[25:47.80]Like I finally have the revelation.
[25:50.20]Like, no, I was wrong.
[25:51.48]I was wrong.
[25:56.76]You guys are like zombies.
[26:01.16]And then you guys throw me out of the tower.
[26:05.68]What are you talking about?
[26:10.67]I'm talking about the zombies.
[26:16.19]And then as I'm falling, whoever one of you guys has the superpowers...
[26:21.54]Like sees that I'm falling and like dives down with your fucking hands down flying.
[26:25.98]And you catch me and we fly away.
[26:27.98]And I finally, I come to the, I recover in the hospital.
[26:34.27]Crikey, can you please help me?
[26:36.53]I'm trying.
[26:45.47]Somebody save me.
[26:46.46]Somebody save me here.
[26:48.58]Somebody save me.
[26:56.85]I don't even know what's happening right here.
[27:09.40]I don't know what that was.
[27:11.64]What's the difference?
[27:12.50]Oh, there's only- is there less things?
[27:15.04]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[27:18.28]I think there are less activities.
[27:19.90]Alright, hold on.
[27:22.14]Let me just quit.
[27:23.91]There he is.
[27:24.55]Wait, where's the name?
[27:25.43]Elizabeth?
[27:26.59]Where is it?
[27:26.87]Where's the... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:27.83]We're looking for the lead designer.
[27:30.85]They didn't have one.
[27:32.64]That's their problem.
[27:33.22]They didn't have one.
[27:34.76]Design manager, Sally Mark.
[27:36.88]Vice president, no.
[27:37.84]General manager of the... No, no, no, no, no.
[27:45.11]Special thanks.
[27:46.25]That's the guy we want to, we want to like call that guy up and be like, oh, no, thank you.
[27:56.58]Maybe it was a budget thing.
[28:00.00]It was probably a budget thing.
[28:08.61]It has to be.
[28:10.45]The game's over now.
[28:11.69]Oh god.
[28:18.48]What do I do?
[28:19.32]Alright, hold on.
[28:20.74]I have a solution.
[28:23.62]I have a solution.
