[ve:60.16.100]

[00:10.14]place this here, and then I'm going to buy myself a nice little shield.
[00:15.52]Shields do come in handy.
[00:19.88]There we go.
[00:23.20]Alright, this is pretty much where we, you know, when we did the first little run through, this is pretty much where we stopped, so now this is all new to us.
[00:34.95]So we're not going to be able just to run through it.
[00:38.95]Let's see.
[00:40.23]Why is there another little sign?
[00:45.34]Where's the checkpoint?
[00:46.00]Actually, hold on.
[00:46.96]Oh, no, no, no.
[00:47.28]I think we did.
[00:47.86]Did you turn this in?
[00:48.48]We have to talk to the guy.
[00:49.80]Oh, yeah, we can talk to the guy.
[00:52.18]I figured that once you bought the shield, it was just like, okay, you did it.
[00:55.10]Congratulations.
[00:57.63]field or and I have a doll here we go you can call me a real everyone slide in I don't think it's dot mister said yet trust you if you're going to ever find the polls you'll need to keep moving to keep you saying that uh... the day-night cycle that at least it's this actually very cool I like the art from Borderlands it's really nice it's split class if you ask me
[01:23.99]Mm-hmm.
[01:24.85]It's kind of half cel-shaded, half something else.
[01:28.49]Here, ready?
[01:29.15]Combo on this guy.
[01:30.73]Oh, ready?
[01:31.22]One, two, three, bang.
[01:33.78]Oh, I shot you in the back.
[01:38.60]You were, like, ripping it up.
[01:45.75]Alright, he's over here, isn't he?
[01:48.21]On the right over here, yeah.
[01:49.53]Something like that.
[01:50.41]That's what the diamond is telling me.
[01:54.69]I'll watch it.
[02:00.24]Reload.
[02:03.96]Oh, nice.
[02:04.66]The fire.
[02:19.10]Don't ask me why I picked the sniper class.
[02:23.28]In all first-person shooters, I am an awful sniper.
[02:28.30]Level up.
[02:30.32]That's good.
[02:30.76]Watch out for that barrel.
[02:32.06]There's a repeater on the ground.
[02:34.65]It sucks, though.
[02:36.33]Too bad.
[02:37.91]That really sucks.
[02:39.29]That's terrible.
[02:43.76]I love the animation for the hit thing already.
[02:46.74]I have a thing against barrels now.
[02:48.24]Yeah, ever since you, you know, Smokey McBlow up and blew us all up at the beginning.
[02:52.96]Yeah, I shot some skags that are coming after us.
[02:57.96]Oh, yeah, they're far away.
[02:58.82]Yeah, let's run away.
[03:00.67]Run away, run away.
[03:01.95]Oh, but this, oh, yeah, okay, now it's time to run.
[03:04.65]Time to run.
[03:05.09]Time to run.
[03:06.85]I kind of ditched you on that one.
[03:11.11]I am a sniper, so I'm supposed to be standing back and letting... No, they're not chasing us.
[03:16.33]Actually, they are still chasing us.
[03:17.59]Hold on, let me kill this one.
[03:19.02]Oh yeah, I was getting ready to do that.
[03:21.84]Alright, let's get out of here.
[03:28.30]And I won't be splitting up the episodes in different introductions.
[03:33.10]Hello again, we're back.
[03:34.26]No, screw that.
[03:36.79]We'll just be recording in chunks and...
[03:40.27]Just get right into it, into each episode.
[03:42.71]Correct.
[03:43.41]Cha-ching.
[03:44.47]Alright.
[03:48.06]There's something scheduled, and I don't like it.
[03:50.44]Okay, we have to go meet Nine Toes.
[03:52.80]Nine Toes.
[03:55.18]Nine what?
[03:56.28]Actually, I think we have to kill Nine Toes, and we're meeting TK Baja.
[04:01.75]Correct.
[04:02.37]Whatever his name is.
[04:03.99]Oh, there's a little red dot, so... Are those guys, or could those be Skags, or...
[04:09.46]I think those are just general enemies, depending on... Yeah, those... It says they're right here.
[04:13.79]I don't know which way you want to go.
[04:16.85]Up around?
[04:17.51]Up, up, up.
[04:21.11]They're definitely shooting at us.
[04:26.14]I'm not getting any bullets on me.
[04:28.14]Let's just ditch.
[04:29.24]You want to ditch?
[04:30.06]One of those little freak shows is running after us.
[04:32.42]Really?
[04:33.08]Yeah, he's like right here.
[04:34.22]Oh, where is he now?
[04:35.98]There he is.
[04:37.87]Oh god, I missed.
[04:38.63]Oh no, oh no, oh no.
[04:40.73]Nice.
[04:41.55]Come on, let's get out of here.
[04:42.77]Let's get out of here.
[04:46.70]Oh, hello.
[04:48.52]Oh, damn.
[04:49.44]Oh, just TK Baja.
[04:51.14]What did we do?
[04:52.84]One more step and it'll be your last.
[04:54.86]This guy's funny.
[04:56.68]You should have seen the look on your face.
[04:58.78]You should have seen the look on your face.
[05:01.94]This guy's a weirdo.
[05:02.72]Alright, what do we need to do?
[05:04.52]Oh, let's find a way.
[05:08.01]We need to collect the reward.
[05:11.65]TK's food.
[05:14.35]Stolen food.
[05:15.01]Recover the stolen food.
[05:17.06]Go get my food back, then we'll talk after I ain't so pissed off.
[05:22.70]Wait, there's another thing around here, I think.
[05:25.18]In the dumpster.
[05:26.32]Let's go get his food.
[05:33.52]He has, like, a farm here.
[05:34.78]What's he growing?
[05:35.40]Hemp?
[05:35.98]Is it?
[05:37.83]Oh, damn!
[05:38.85]Whoa.
[05:41.75]It's kind of gross.
[05:43.01]I don't think I'd want to eat this food.
[05:46.15]Yeah, just go get my food.
[05:47.35]It's, like, a bunch of, like, piles of dog crap, like, down the road.
[05:51.44]Alrighty.
[05:52.10]We're taking these guys out?
[05:53.82]Yeah.
[05:54.16]I'm going to stay back.
[05:55.02]You go ahead and go forward.
[05:57.16]Reconnaissance.
[05:58.92]My food.
[06:00.44]I don't see any enemies.
[06:02.74]So maybe I'll just run around and collect stuff.
[06:07.26]Yeah, I'll be running towards the next one.
[06:08.52]There's more food here.
[06:09.30]They're going to target me in a second.
[06:10.72]Yeah, I'll make sure to stay away.
[06:14.32]Ready?
[06:14.56]I'm going to shoot at these guys.
[06:16.36]Alright, I'm going to stay back.
[06:17.44]Ready?
[06:17.72]Headshot on the skag that's walking away from us.
[06:21.36]Three, two, one.
[06:26.20]I went for the wrong one.
[06:29.00]Oh, yeah.
[06:29.42]Every single damn shot.
[06:30.70]Me too.
[06:31.10]Ready?
[06:31.38]There we go.
[06:31.96]Sexy times!
[06:33.66]Oh, watch out for this one.
[06:34.52]Is he eating his friend?
[06:35.12]Oh, is he feeding on his own kind?
[06:36.32]What a cannibal.
[06:38.78]Oh, careful.
[06:40.46]Ow, I want to get a kill with this.
[06:42.67]Stop hitting me.
[06:43.91]This thing takes a long time to reload, man.
[06:46.87]I need, like, a quicker reload time.
[06:49.11]Huzzah!
[06:51.87]Die!
[06:53.49]Yeah, you surrounded me.
[06:54.67]Whoa!
[06:55.03]Whoa!
[06:57.86]Oh, way too close.
[06:59.42]I got him.
[06:59.76]I got him for you.
[07:01.96]Get away, Robbie.
[07:03.06]You damn... Cash flow.
[07:06.97]These guys carry like 18 bucks with them just for no reason.
[07:11.91]What does this guy even say?
[07:13.59]Looks a little less appetizing after all it's been through.
[07:16.19]That's nasty.
[07:19.41]What I need is health.
[07:21.72]Yeah, I think there's a machine somewhere over there.
[07:25.10]Sooner or later...
[07:27.73]Huh?
[07:28.39]Huh?
[07:28.89]You sound like Link from Zelda.
[07:32.47]Yeah, I do.
[07:33.55]Like the little boy Link.
[07:41.42]Oh, yeah.
[07:42.14]For some reason, I don't know if we're on a different planet, but I've never seen anyone be able to jump this high.
[07:48.14]We're on Pandora.
[07:50.31]Oh, okay.
[07:51.27]See, that's what I get for not paying attention to the introductions.
[07:55.95]Alright, we got to go get grenades for him.
[07:57.61]Grenades.
[07:57.89]Watch out behind you.
[07:58.91]Whoa.
[08:00.15]So, dude, what are you... Oh, watch out behind you again.
[08:04.12]Behind you again.
[08:06.46]There's another one.
[08:08.02]They got nothing on me.
[08:22.26]There's a lot of people here.
[08:23.38]Oh shit.
[08:23.90]I forgot about these guys.
[08:24.80]Ready?
[08:25.16]Take out the guy on the left first.
[08:26.94]He's got a shield.
[08:28.94]Shoot him.
[08:29.16]Headshot him.
[08:29.58]Headshot him.
[08:30.02]I'm trying.
[08:31.98]This gun is very, very inaccurate from far away.
[08:34.64]There we go.
[08:37.34]Have a lot.
[08:38.08]There we go.
[08:40.22]Here, take the health.
[08:41.54]I'm full.
[08:43.68]Yeah, I'm full too.
[08:45.10]Yeah, then I'll grab it.
[08:46.52]I only had two health to take, so it's alright.
[08:49.54]Miner insta health vial.
[08:52.61]Yeah, I think there's the ones that regain more over time, and then there's the ones that heal you instantly, fast.
[08:59.25]Oh, cool.
[08:59.69]Alright, wait, do we have to... Oh, yeah, in here.
[09:02.30]Yeah, this is the new... This dude's shop.
[09:07.20]Bye, Akron.
[09:08.74]So, do we ever find out... Do we share money?
[09:12.02]I don't know.
[09:13.60]Here, wait.
[09:14.64]Let me just grab all the money we have here.
[09:16.20]And... It's just lying around because everybody has boxes that they just leave.
[09:21.14]Unappended.
[09:22.20]Alright, so here, I grabbed... Here, now we have 1,651.
[09:26.06]I'm gonna buy myself a... What's this?
[09:32.07]A Crimston Cobra.
[09:35.95]And it has a level requirement of 6, but I can buy it anyways.
[09:38.77]No, I can't because that's 2,800.
[09:41.99]Yeah, I think we do share money because mine is at $16.51 now, too.
[09:45.63]How much is this sniper rifle?
[09:47.73]Yeah.
[09:48.99]It's got to be level 5.
[09:50.15]It's $9.87.
[09:50.29]Should I buy it?
[09:50.87]It's better than the one I have.
[09:55.12]I guess.
[09:56.40]It's much better than the one I have.
[09:58.62]Here, wait.
[09:59.08]This one, the one you want goes on the left.
[10:03.58]Yeah.
[10:04.58]Let me see if I can.
[10:05.27]Did you buy it?
[10:06.91]I am about to buy it right now.
[10:09.31]Bought it.
[10:10.98]So now do you have $664?
[10:12.02]No, I have $1651.
[10:13.32]Alright, so then I was just completely and totally wrong.
[10:18.34]Well, that's good.
[10:18.94]I mean... Let's see if I can equip some of this stuff.
[10:26.49]Oh, wait.
[10:26.79]I need to be at least level 6.
[10:27.95]That's fine.
[10:28.29]Whatever.
[10:28.85]We'll level up fast anyways.
[10:30.93]Yeah, that's cool.
[10:31.99]Alright, let's go get TK Baja his... Sandwiches.
[10:37.20]Yeah.
[10:38.02]Sandwiches!
[10:44.81]You look like a spider monkey jumping.
[10:47.88]Oh, never mind.
[10:48.36]I thought we had to turn it into that guy.
[10:49.46]We had to turn it into the guy on the porch.
[10:51.64]You look like a spider monkey jumping.
[10:53.94]I do?
[10:54.20]Yeah, I wish there was like a third person view or something.
[10:59.12]Maybe there probably is, but just so I could see what the guy looks like.
[11:04.12]He's got like spiky hair, doesn't he?
[11:06.59]Your guy?
[11:07.65]No, he has like a bandana.
[11:09.75]Oh, okay, right.
[11:12.75]Let's go back to this freak show.
[11:15.41]I feel like chucking a nade at him.
[11:18.25]Imagine if you did that.
[11:20.09]Is he blind?
[11:20.71]Yeah, I guess he is.
[11:23.41]I guess so, huh?
[11:24.92]Alright, we got to go take down nine toes.
[11:27.12]Alright.
[11:28.98]Nine toes, here we come.
[11:30.16]You better be ready.
[11:35.36]The radar says that there's people over here to our left, but I haven't seen anybody here.
[11:40.57]Yeah, I'm going to try and invade them.
[11:41.67]Watch out, there's skags on our right.
[11:43.76]Yeah.
[11:44.42]We don't want to, like, aggro those guys.
[11:48.60]Oh, whoops.
[11:50.32]I did.
[11:51.34]It's alright.
[11:51.90]I can... Oh!
[11:53.78]Feel my wrath.
[11:55.29]Oh, nice shooting, Tex.
[11:57.61]Nice shooting, Tex.
[11:59.41]God, I love the combos you can do with this thing.
[12:04.33]Yeah, you got an SMG, right?
[12:05.85]Yeah.
[12:08.45]Yeah, I just used a, like, a MMO term.
[12:12.58]I said aggro.
[12:14.30]What's that?
[12:15.64]It's a term that you use when... Oh, hold on.
[12:19.77]It's a term you use... Oh!
[12:21.35]A term you use when an enemy attracts to you.
[12:26.93]In an MMO, especially in a game like World of Warcraft, we called it aggro for, like, aggression.
[12:33.34]Yeah.
[12:33.94]It's just burned in my brain now, so should I blow it?
[12:36.04]Would you like to do the honors?
[12:37.36]Wait, I'm stuck.
[12:39.54]You know what?
[12:40.53]You can do the honors.
[12:41.33]You can do it.
[12:41.99]I would hate to take that joy away from somebody.
[12:46.61]Oh, I wanted to do it!
[12:47.79]I wanted to do it!
[12:49.19]I heard that blast all the way over here!
[12:55.66]Bam!
[12:57.76]Time to give Nine Toes a piece of that!
[13:01.00]I'm updating your echo system with his location.
[13:03.64]Come and see me once you put his bits to the grinder.
[13:06.59]Nine Toes.
[13:08.96]Battle time!
[13:09.82]Whoa!
[13:11.12]Scaggoli!
[13:12.76]Repair broken claptraps you find to gain additional inventory space as a reward.
[13:17.56]That's pretty cool.
[13:18.36]There's more than one?
[13:19.08]There's more than one of those things?
[13:21.48]They're annoying as butt.
[13:23.10]I thought there was only one.
[13:24.70]Here, wait, let me see what shield I can get, because I might be able to buy one.
[13:28.92]No, they're expensive, holy crap.
[13:31.41]Are they?
[13:32.21]Yeah.
[13:34.39]Balanced healing shield.
[13:37.55]Oh my god, they are.
[13:39.27]They're like over a thousand dollars.
[13:40.35]Maybe I can sell something.
[13:41.39]Wait, you can sell yours.
[13:42.51]Oh yeah, it's that option in the middle.
[13:46.68]Okay.
[13:48.58]How much does it sell for?
[13:50.74]Not that much.
[13:51.46]35 bucks.
[13:54.18]I'm not even going to sell it.
[13:55.06]Mine sells for 35 dollars.
[13:56.28]Oh, what the heck is that thing on the right?
[13:58.15]Look at the item of the day.
[14:02.27]That's dyslexia.
[14:03.67]Type A dyslexia.
[14:05.11]Item time of the day.
[14:08.52]Level requirement 10 and it's 9,000 bucks.
[14:11.94]Yeah, it's just like we were talking about in the beginning.
[14:15.32]It's like Diablo.
[14:18.04]Pretty much any RPG that has item qualities.
[14:20.68]There's so many items.
[14:22.02]Yeah, so it's like white is normal, green is rare, purple is legendary.
[14:27.84]It's something like that.
[14:28.74]I'm sure we'll find out as we go.
[14:31.16]We'll figure our shits out.
[14:32.22]Ready to take these guys out in pro boss mode 1, 2, 3?
[14:36.58]Pro boss mode.
[14:38.98]Oh.
[14:40.01]Man, I can't wait to equip that rifle.
[14:42.69]Whoa.
[14:43.49]That guy just came out of nowhere.
[14:45.73]Short range, short range.
[14:47.33]Oh, there's another one right here, huh?
